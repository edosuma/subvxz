WEBVTT

00:45.420 --> 00:47.001
Kallie?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.181
Kallie?

01:17.661 --> 01:19.447
Kallie.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.492
Kallie!

01:25.544 --> 01:27.250
Hey, babe.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.249
Where you been at?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.331
I'm just saying, you know.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.618
Kid's got 20/20,
he knows his ABCs. 1, 2, 3s.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.172
That's better than most
witnesses we got.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.716
The state still needs to know
if Adrian's mentally stable enough

02:16.845 --> 02:18.927
to be considered
a credible witness.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.804
Psychologist is on his way.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.267
So, how long is it gonna take
for Dr. Spock

02:29.274 --> 02:32.937
to do his mind-meld thing
before we can see Picasso?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.854
We're gonna be here all day.

02:39.451 --> 02:42.158
It's okay.
I got patience.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.035
I'm a patient man.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.373
He saw the man
who killed his mom, Holder.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.959
And he's remembering
more and more.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.558
Linden.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.810
What?

03:08.855 --> 03:10.231
When?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.479
Okay, here we come.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.477
That son of a bitch...
He stole my money.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.361
Your money?

03:18.407 --> 03:19.863
Dude must be really desperate.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.614
He took my car, too.
I already told him.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.035
Did, uh, Joe tell you
where he might be going?

03:25.038 --> 03:28.826
Some out-of-town ass
he might have tagged or...

03:28.834 --> 03:31.621
Montessori he was scouting
for talent?

03:31.670 --> 03:32.910
Holder.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.634
I thought it was Kallie.
I thought she had come home.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.425
You got to find him.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.143
He only wanted your money?

03:50.147 --> 03:52.934
I-I-I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.646
He took a bunch
of his camping stuff

03:56.695 --> 03:58.936
and his fishing stuff.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.729
Did he take anything else?

04:00.782 --> 04:04.024
Uh, he asked me if, uh...

04:04.077 --> 04:06.284
ifI still had snow chains
in my trunk.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.995
Does he have a cabin?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.167
Someplace he could hide out.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.871
No, he doesn't have
anything like that.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.421
What about camp sites,

04:15.422 --> 04:16.958
places in the woods
he would go?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.043
You said he took
his camping and fishing gear.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.175
Um, he was...
he was into backwoods stuff

04:22.220 --> 04:23.505
back when we met,

04:23.555 --> 04:26.297
but that was way up
along the border.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.556
Dispatch has the make and model
of Danette's car.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.561
Skinner's alerting
border patrol,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.472
port authority is staging at all
the major freeway routes

04:35.525 --> 04:37.026
and transitions on the border.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.478
Guy's got a two-hour
head start.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.439
If he's trying to cross
the border into Canada,

04:40.489 --> 04:42.821
we're gonna be playing
"Where's Waldo?" forever, you know?

04:44.159 --> 04:46.571
Yeah. I'll let you know
what we find.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.569
Danette has
this old storage unit

04:48.580 --> 04:49.695
in Rainier Valley.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.113
She remembers putting away

04:51.166 --> 04:52.997
a lot of Mills'
old camping stuff there.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.409
I ain't rooting around some damn
storage unit, Linden.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.580
It's got his maps...

04:56.588 --> 04:58.749
all of his whole backwoods
topographical maps,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.960
every place he ever camped,
hunted, fished.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.047
All right, then.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.799
I mean,
you could have just said.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.855
I'll leave a message.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.142
It's for
Detective Sarah Linden.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.732
Tell her Ray...

05:22.739 --> 05:25.776
Seward called.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.191
I'll be waiting.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.828
You really think that cop's
gonna save you, Seward?

05:32.541 --> 05:34.748
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.408
So you found God now, huh?

05:36.461 --> 05:38.998
You guys are like clockwork,
you know that?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.548
Dale, you hear that?

05:40.590 --> 05:42.421
You got a little Jesus
circle jerk buddy here.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.798
I'm getting out, Francis.
And when I do,

05:43.885 --> 05:45.841
maybe I'll pay a little visit
to your wife,

05:45.971 --> 05:48.257
have a go at her just like
everyone else in here.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.053
Come on!

05:53.103 --> 05:54.343
You can do better than that.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.511
Open the gate.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.976
- Francis?
- Open the gate!

06:05.407 --> 06:08.774
The psychologist
is still talking to him?

06:08.785 --> 06:11.697
So, how long till Adrian's
cleared to speak with me?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.785
Contact me immediately
when that happens.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.790
Power by the hour?

06:24.009 --> 06:25.419
Actually, give me a smoke.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.628
No.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.259
What do you mean, "no"?

06:28.263 --> 06:30.470
I mean, no.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.096
Seriously?

06:32.142 --> 06:34.599
Yep.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.384
Oh, it's fine.
I get it.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.305
All I'm saying is,
you know, you buy a pack or two,

06:39.357 --> 06:41.894
reciprocate the love
every now and then,

06:41.943 --> 06:43.479
and, you know, we're back
to being BFFs again.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.395
Whatever. I gave you one.
You gave it to Bullet.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.609
What's going on?
You two break up?

06:48.658 --> 06:50.068
She's unreliable.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.983
Can't trust her no more.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.117
Here it is.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.154
Can't have a CI like that.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.418
Damn.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.958
For being broke as shit,

07:08.011 --> 07:10.218
Danette sure has
got a ton of it.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.141
That's why we couldn't
get eyes on him.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.894
Son of a bitch was holed up here
the whole time.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.610
Seriously, Linden, I was just
playing with you back there.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.866
If you need a fix that bad...

07:37.791 --> 07:39.747
I'll head it off!
You cover the back!

07:56.434 --> 07:57.264
Aah!

08:01.481 --> 08:02.470
Linden!

08:02.482 --> 08:05.064
Holder!

08:19.833 --> 08:22.415
Holder!

08:22.460 --> 08:24.166
Holder!

08:46.526 --> 08:47.857
Aah!

08:51.573 --> 08:52.528
Aah!

08:52.574 --> 08:55.065
Hey.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.512
Talk to the medic?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.472
I'm fine.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.773
What are we charging him with?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.601
Well, we're waiting to hear back
from the DA,

09:27.650 --> 09:29.732
'cause we don't have anything
linking him yet to the bodies.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.569
Lieutenant!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.358
Loo!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.272
You need to see this.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.403
Christmas come early.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.696
Looks like his rings.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.115
We got him.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.829
All right,
nobody touches this stuff

09:46.878 --> 09:48.789
until the forensics
and lab boys get here.

09:48.797 --> 09:49.786
Emily, get me the DA

09:49.839 --> 09:50.828
Tell him it's urgent.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.463
All right, steady, people,
steady!

09:52.509 --> 09:55.376
Moments like this,
there's an old police saying...

09:55.428 --> 09:57.544
First round's on me!

10:05.063 --> 10:06.553
Hey, loo, you there?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.680
We found Mil/s' cab
down on the ground floor.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.848
'Bout to check it out.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.108
Think he's got another body
in the trunk.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.109
We found blood
all over the bumper.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.979
Don't open it!
Excuse me!

10:16.032 --> 10:18.068
Coming through.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.786
It's stuck.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.131
Give me that thing.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.442
Holder!

10:54.487 --> 10:57.729
Stop! Move!
Coming through.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.817
Get out of my way!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.656
Don't open the trunk!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.072
What?

11:08.126 --> 11:12.165
Just come over here.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.250
Please, Holder.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.510
You don't need to be here.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.132
Holder, please don't.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.759
What'd the coroner say?

12:04.849 --> 12:08.592
Same C.O.D.
as the other 18.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.011
She was dead
less than 12 hours.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.850
She fought back, right?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.514
Yeah.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.853
Broken wrist,
dozens of defensive wounds.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.143
She didn't go quietly.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.859
You know, report says this
sick prick resisted arrest.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.857
Doesn't look like it to me.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.451
You? Hmm?

12:27.497 --> 12:30.830
Five minutes, no witnesses?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.456
No questions?

12:32.502 --> 12:34.618
Just say the word.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.094
Holder.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.308
Just give him some time.
He'll be all right.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.148
All right. Where are we?

13:04.200 --> 13:07.067
Forensics is running tests
on the rings,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.405
match them to our bodies.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.910
Got our guys out there
showing photos of the jewelry

13:09.914 --> 13:11.415
to the families.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.537
Help expedite the IDs.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.039
And what about Trisha Seward?

13:14.085 --> 13:16.417
Are we trying to connect
any of the rings to her?

13:16.421 --> 13:20.130
We got 18 other girls to worry
about first, Sarah.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.085
So, let me question Mills.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.002
He's not talking to anyone.
Except his girlfriend.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.555
Danette?

13:26.597 --> 13:28.337
He insists
he's got to talk to her.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.506
Is that kosher, boss?

13:29.559 --> 13:31.390
Well, whatever he tells her
is admissible.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.846
I want a confession.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.432
I don't give a damn
how we get it.

13:35.481 --> 13:40.350
There's no blue ring
with the other jewelry.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.270
Maybe he's gonna tell us
where Kallie is.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.783
Is it true that Joseph Mills
has been arrested

13:49.829 --> 13:51.865
- in connection with this case?
- No comment.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.996
Can you confirm Joseph Mills
as the Pied Piper?

13:54.042 --> 13:57.751
Excuse me.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.830
Stephen!

14:04.385 --> 14:06.967
Hey.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.840
I heard what happened.

14:11.893 --> 14:15.056
Ohh, I'm sorry.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.015
But you know the reality.

14:20.068 --> 14:24.482
The... the danger these kids
put themselves in every day.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.111
Yeah.

14:26.157 --> 14:30.366
It's their choice
to be out on the streets.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.993
It doesn't really matter
if she died.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.658
It's just another statistic.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.246
That's not what I'm saying.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.453
You think this tattoo...
Do you think it's cute?

14:38.503 --> 14:39.458
What?

14:39.504 --> 14:41.916
Do you even know what it means?

14:43.800 --> 14:46.257
I'm an addict!

14:46.302 --> 14:48.759
A tweaker.

14:48.805 --> 14:54.050
I shot meth into my veins
every day.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.763
Just get out.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.060
Just get out!

15:21.170 --> 15:24.662
I was at social services.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.751
Your P.O. gave me this.

15:26.801 --> 15:27.790
Listen...

15:27.844 --> 15:30.256
You're officially
off probation, baby.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.885
You can go to LA. now,

15:31.931 --> 15:35.423
start modeling
and... and acting.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.929
My social worker,

15:40.940 --> 15:44.307
she said she'd get one of
those new apartments for me...

15:44.318 --> 15:46.980
if I could get the deposit.

15:47.029 --> 15:50.942
So it's like...

15:50.992 --> 15:53.358
Great news for both of us.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.582
Baby?

16:01.627 --> 16:02.878
Are you okay?

16:02.879 --> 16:06.042
It...

16:06.048 --> 16:07.788
It's...

16:07.842 --> 16:09.628
It's Bullet.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.192
Hey, babe.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.815
You look good.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.070
Where's Kallie?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.614
I don't know.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.535
You got to believe me...
I didn't do any of this.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.577
Come on, you know me.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.250
You know I could never
hurt anybody.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.633
You had her cellphone.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.712
Yeah, I was trying to get her
away from the hotel.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.218
She was screaming at me,

16:54.263 --> 16:57.005
and, like, she's high as a kite
or something.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.639
And the next thing I know,

16:58.643 --> 17:00.679
she jumps out of my cab
and she just takes off.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.684
You never told me
that you saw her!

17:02.730 --> 17:04.766
What did you do to her
in that hotel?

17:04.815 --> 17:06.191
Nothing, Danette.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.602
I loved that kid.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.062
And you know that.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.062
All right, listen.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.822
Here's what you're gonna do.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.325
You're gonna get
some money together.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.611
You and my mom.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.575
And you're gonna get me
a real lawyer.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.989
And you're gonna get me
out of here,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.248
and then we 're gonna find her.

17:24.293 --> 17:26.204
Okay?

17:26.254 --> 17:29.371
I promise you we will find her,

17:29.423 --> 17:32.460
and we will be a family again.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.004
- Babe.
- I talked to your mother!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.968
She told me... she told me
what you did to those kids.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.268
She's done protecting you.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.392
She said that you're not
her little boy anymore.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.727
Bullshit.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.658
She...

18:00.621 --> 18:02.031
She told me.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.073
She... she told me everything you
did to those girls in the hotel...

18:05.126 --> 18:07.412
those films.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.580
Why?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.799
Those little girls...

18:18.848 --> 18:22.011
They came to me.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.175
It's not wrong.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.640
It's nature.
It can't be helped.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.358
They look at me...

18:32.403 --> 18:35.236
with that ache...

18:35.281 --> 18:38.614
that sweet, sweet ache.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.155
And they look at me
with those little sad eyes,

18:41.203 --> 18:43.159
and they're like,
"Please, mister.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.661
"Please.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.618
Just make it go away."

18:48.753 --> 18:50.914
I was gentle.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.045
And I took care of them.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.883
And I made it go away.

18:57.928 --> 19:02.342
What did you to her?
What did you do to my baby?

19:02.391 --> 19:05.303
What did you do to her?!

19:06.729 --> 19:08.014
What did you do to my baby?!

19:10.691 --> 19:13.979
Where's Kallie?
Where is she?!

19:14.028 --> 19:16.394
Where's my daughter,
you son of a bitch?!

19:16.447 --> 19:18.654
Where ’5 Kallie?!

19:18.699 --> 19:21.987
Where is my daughter?!
What did you do to her?!

19:27.792 --> 19:30.659
Adrian...

19:30.711 --> 19:34.420
I'd like to talk to you
about what happened to your mom

19:34.465 --> 19:38.049
on the night of
December 26, 2009.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.383
That night,

19:39.387 --> 19:43.881
do you remember seeing
anyone else in your apartment?

19:43.891 --> 19:45.222
Besides your mom?

19:50.106 --> 19:53.439
No one's gonna hurt you
if you did.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.819
I promise you.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.772
You can tell me.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.739
I'm gonna need you
to answer yes or no, okay?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.574
It's for the tape recorder.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.911
Yes.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.952
You're doing great.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.878
What did you see
this man doing?

20:19.927 --> 20:22.760
He hurt my mom.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.592
He had a knife.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.848
Can you tell me where you were

20:27.893 --> 20:30.680
when you saw this man
who hurt your mom?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.140
In the closet.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.855
It was late, and I woke up.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.642
It was late.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.441
Um, were the lights on...
in your apartment?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.697
Is that how you were able
to see him?

20:43.701 --> 20:46.613
No. It was dark.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.246
Um...

20:51.292 --> 20:52.828
The Christmas tree was on.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.461
My mom kept the lights
on the Christmas tree at night.

20:56.505 --> 20:57.665
That's how.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.719
Is the man you saw that night,

21:09.769 --> 21:12.101
the one with the knife
who hurt your mom,

21:12.146 --> 21:13.477
in any of these photos?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.571
Are you sure that was him?

21:28.579 --> 21:31.036
You're positive?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.532
Can I see my dad now?

21:40.841 --> 21:42.456
From day one,

21:42.468 --> 21:46.086
Joseph Mills has always been
a person of interest.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.551
And as the press liaison
reported earlier today,

21:49.600 --> 21:53.764
due to excellent police work,

21:53.813 --> 21:57.101
we have the suspect
in police custody at this time.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.731
Now, the important thing is...

21:59.735 --> 22:03.694
the so-called "Pied Piper"
is finally off the streets,

22:03.739 --> 22:07.152
and the city of Seattle
can rest easy tonight.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.282
Any more questions?

22:18.128 --> 22:20.084
Got any messages for me?

22:23.467 --> 22:26.425
Five from Elliot Bay...
a Ray Seward.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.106
You've reached the Washington
Department of Corrections,

22:41.443 --> 22:43.274
If you know your
party's extension,

22:43.279 --> 22:44.985
please enter it now,
or press 1 for...

22:45.072 --> 22:48.656
Hey.
You all right?

22:49.577 --> 22:50.987
You want to sit?

22:51.161 --> 22:52.697
Yeah.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.075
I think that I...

22:55.124 --> 22:56.660
I think I deserve this.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.077
Nobody deserves this.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.537
No.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.543
I pick messed-up guys.

23:01.589 --> 23:02.704
I know that.
I know.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.008
But Joe, he was nice to me.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.426
He was nice to Kallie.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.845
He bought her
these Christmas presents

23:08.888 --> 23:10.503
the first year
we were together and...

23:10.556 --> 23:13.548
I mean, they were...
they were late... but like...

23:13.601 --> 23:14.841
at least he tried.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.725
He went off to Alaska,

23:16.770 --> 23:19.056
and he was, like,
saving up money

23:19.106 --> 23:20.266
to buy these things.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.398
I thought he was one of
the good ones, you know?

23:26.363 --> 23:29.696
What'd he get her
for Christmas?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.607
I don't know...
one of those dolls

23:31.660 --> 23:32.945
with the hair that grows.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.656
They're creepy, if you ask me.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.320
Kallie was 12,

23:36.373 --> 23:39.957
but she acted like
a little girl.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.334
Wait, Kallie was 12?
This was three years ago?

23:42.379 --> 23:43.664
Yeah.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.173
And Joe was in Alaska?

23:45.257 --> 23:47.373
Yeah, on some boat,
fishing or something?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.382
When?
When was he there?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.261
I-I told you... Christmas.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.471
I dropped him off at the docks
two weeks before,

23:54.516 --> 23:56.552
and then he came back
at the end of January.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.967
So he wasn't...
He wasn't here?

23:58.020 --> 23:59.226
He wasn't in Seattle

23:59.271 --> 24:02.013
the day after Christmas
three years ago?

24:02.066 --> 24:03.852
You're sure?

24:03.901 --> 24:05.983
What...
what did I just say?

24:06.028 --> 24:07.768
Did I just say some...

24:07.821 --> 24:09.482
Did I do something wrong?

24:15.496 --> 24:19.330
Give me the phone!

24:19.375 --> 24:23.493
I got to make a call!
It's my right!

24:25.756 --> 24:30.250
Give me the phone!!

24:33.681 --> 24:38.175
Give me the phone!!

24:52.282 --> 24:54.443
You got your calls.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.360
You left your messages.
She's not coming.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.574
Get me the phone.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.913
No one's coming for you.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.792
It's time you understand that.

25:08.298 --> 25:10.129
Come on!

25:12.761 --> 25:14.171
Oh, you know what?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.553
I did get one message.

25:16.598 --> 25:18.680
I forgot.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.933
"To Ray Seward,"

25:20.978 --> 25:23.720
from the State of Washington.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.980
"24 hours prior
to your execution,

25:26.984 --> 25:29.646
you get an extra hour
yard time."

25:29.695 --> 25:30.810
Yippee.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.605
Get as much air
in those lungs as you can.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.036
Ray.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.667
I know you're starting
to have doubts.

25:47.713 --> 25:51.251
But there's still time.

25:51.258 --> 25:54.921
There's always time.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.302
There's always hope.

26:00.142 --> 26:03.134
Don't give up.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.755
I'm gonna fall.
Hey, hey, don't look.

26:36.804 --> 26:37.759
I got you.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.387
Just a little further.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.889
Okay.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.517
Where are we?

26:45.521 --> 26:46.806
It's not much.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.688
It's just, like,
a place to start, you know?

26:49.691 --> 26:51.352
You paid the deposit?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.356
Mm-hmm.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.734
This is mine?!

26:54.780 --> 26:56.736
No, it's... it’s ours.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.651
O-ours?

27:00.786 --> 27:01.866
Huh?

27:01.912 --> 27:03.823
I-I love it!
Oh, my God!

27:03.872 --> 27:06.124
Not bad, huh?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.740
It's so beautiful!

27:07.751 --> 27:10.618
Nice little view.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.130
What about L.A.?

27:15.342 --> 27:18.550
Oh, it was...a dumb idea.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.335
Imean...

27:20.347 --> 27:21.712
You know...

27:21.765 --> 27:25.428
Being with you is all I want.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.512
Huh? Is that good news?

27:29.565 --> 27:31.055
Yeah.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.397
Yeah?

27:34.444 --> 27:36.776
We got our own little pad.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.687
It's so clean.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.116
Mm.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.511
Green flower pot.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.393
You weren't gonna answer
the door if I knocked.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.935
It's not your fault.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.988
Did you ever talk to Adrian?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.527
Yeah.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.535
He ID'd Mills,

29:08.538 --> 29:13.123
but Mills was out of town
the night she was killed, so...

29:13.168 --> 29:14.999
Adrian lied.

29:18.423 --> 29:20.914
He must has seen him on TV.

29:20.968 --> 29:22.924
You know, it's everywhere now.

29:25.305 --> 29:28.263
He was just trying
to make you happy.

29:33.647 --> 29:35.808
No one knows...

29:35.899 --> 29:39.391
that Mills was out of town
except Danette.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.268
So...

29:42.864 --> 29:47.028
I could still use Adrian's testimony
to get Seward a stay.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.489
It won't hold up, but...

29:50.747 --> 29:53.079
...it'|l buy me some more time,
at least.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.823
You'd be burying evidence.

29:54.876 --> 29:58.494
Yeah, but Ray Seward's
gonna die tomorrow ifI don't.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.313
I should have picked up.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.447
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

30:27.492 --> 30:28.902
I should've called her back.

30:28.910 --> 30:31.196
Don't do that.
You want to sit here and die?

30:31.246 --> 30:34.488
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.125
Mm.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.134
I'm sorry.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.637
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.268
It's okay.
It's okay.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.304
Oh, I'm sorry.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.312
It's okay.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.815
It's okay.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.869
It's gonna be okay.

31:19.753 --> 31:21.334
It's gonna be okay.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.711
It's all gonna be okay.

31:32.265 --> 31:35.393
You hear that?

31:35.435 --> 31:37.300
Crows.

31:37.354 --> 31:40.221
They're calling to one another.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.104
They're heading home.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.148
We let each other down.

31:47.197 --> 31:48.186
People do.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.320
It happens.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.704
I shouldn't have trusted her.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.619
Will you...

32:03.672 --> 32:05.583
see your boy tomorrow?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.502
What was it like?

32:14.891 --> 32:18.349
When your...
when your son was born?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.730
I was in prison
when he was born.

32:25.402 --> 32:29.190
I didn't see him
till he was seven months old.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.610
God's with you, Ray.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.954
He sees you. He...

32:40.542 --> 32:42.282
He does?

32:42.335 --> 32:45.293
He knows that you're scared.

32:45.338 --> 32:46.498
And alone.

32:46.548 --> 32:50.507
He knows the pain
that you feel.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.338
Every part of it.

32:52.387 --> 32:55.379
I don't know how to pray.

32:57.142 --> 32:59.758
So you can let it go, Ray.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.349
Let it go.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.316
God help me, please.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.272
He's got you.
He's holding you up.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.692
Please, lord, save me.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.031
I'm so scared, God.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.468
Alton...

33:42.479 --> 33:44.219
was... was easy.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.808
But you...

33:45.815 --> 33:48.773
I-I thought
you'd be harder to crack.

33:48.818 --> 33:52.402
Jesus, you should
see your face right now!

33:55.450 --> 33:57.190
Oh, God.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.539
Yeah, on... on...
on the outside,

34:04.584 --> 34:06.495
I used my hands.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.831
I felt them struggle,

34:08.880 --> 34:13.169
fight back,
and then just give in.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.213
In here?

34:19.266 --> 34:22.099
The words do the killing
for me.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.273
I've been killing you
since the day we met.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.324
Your hate, your rage...

34:39.369 --> 34:41.906
your damn...

34:41.913 --> 34:43.073
hope.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.118
Y'all are so predictable.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.794
Boring.

34:54.843 --> 34:57.255
Oh, God.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.295
I hate boring.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.142
I'm done!

35:11.860 --> 35:14.772
Guy downtown's giving me $500
for the shackles

35:14.779 --> 35:17.191
Seward wears
to the execution...

35:17.240 --> 35:20.277
Another $300 for the hood
he wears over his face.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.698
Grab something tomorrow.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.988
These sickos pay better
than O.T.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.783
I'm not on the execution team.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.575
Name's on the list.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.119
What?

35:32.172 --> 35:34.879
Becker said he was short a man.

35:34.924 --> 35:36.334
Volunteered you.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.096
C Block. Henderson.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.551
Oh, thank God it's you.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.924
- Who is this?
- It's Annie!

35:45.977 --> 35:48.184
- Oh, my God! You've got to come!
- What? Annie?

35:48.229 --> 35:49.514
Oh, my God!

35:49.564 --> 35:51.179
Calm down.
I don't understand what you're...

35:51.232 --> 35:52.893
- Francis shot him!
- He shot him?!

36:14.547 --> 36:17.289
Oh, my God.

36:17.342 --> 36:19.298
Annie called the prison.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.835
She couldn't reach you.
She called me.

36:21.888 --> 36:25.005
Some guy showed up...
boyfriend, something...

36:25.058 --> 36:26.594
and your son shot him.

36:26.643 --> 36:29.931
Francis!
He didn't mean to do it!

36:31.648 --> 36:35.391
He didn't mean to!

36:45.537 --> 36:48.950
What's going on?

37:10.395 --> 37:12.807
Hey.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.726
Just need to pick up
the body's personal effects,

37:15.775 --> 37:17.311
log it into evidence.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.852
Ra... Rachel Olmstead,
a.k.a. "Bullet."

37:20.905 --> 37:26.195
I thought Mills
liked killing girls, not boys.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.742
Sorry.
Bad timing?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.114
Yeah.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.909
For me and her both, I guess.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.750
Meaning what?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.168
Meaning her calling the station

37:41.217 --> 37:42.332
a bunch of times last night.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.967
Wait, what the hell
are you talking about?

37:44.971 --> 37:48.259
Oh, yeah.
She was looking for you.

37:48.308 --> 37:50.048
Reddick logged it.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.183
Just figured
it was another wild goose chase.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.726
- Sit. Finish. I'll get it.
- I got it.

38:00.737 --> 38:04.696
Better not be those damn
Amway people again.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.531
Holder.

38:14.584 --> 38:15.539
What...

38:15.585 --> 38:17.041
You talked to her?!

38:17.086 --> 38:19.042
- What the hell?
- You talked to Bullet?!

38:19.088 --> 38:20.248
I called you, damn it!

38:20.298 --> 38:21.834
You son of a bitch!
You could have helped her!

38:21.883 --> 38:24.090
- Oh, my God. Stop!
- Stop it!

38:24.135 --> 38:26.342
- I tried, damn it!
- Stop!!

38:26.387 --> 38:29.379
You talked to her
and you didn't help her?!

38:29.432 --> 38:31.093
I tried calling you!

38:31.142 --> 38:31.927
Stop it!

38:31.976 --> 38:35.059
- Get off!
- Stop!

38:43.571 --> 38:46.813
Get her out of here.
Get her out of here.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.664
Guys were able to match
most of the rings to a victim.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.622
Couldn't ID these four,
though.

39:41.671 --> 39:43.832
DA's pressing Mills.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.922
Could be more bodies.

39:45.967 --> 39:48.879
Another dump site.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.593
How'd it go with Adrian?

39:50.638 --> 39:52.174
I was wrong.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.638
There's no connection between
Trisha Seward and Mills.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.763
I'm sorry.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.235
But it's over.
We got the guy.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.690
For their families.

40:08.740 --> 40:12.278
We give them that, at least.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.658
You going to the execution
tomorrow?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.540
No.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.250
Well, I'm taking the guys out
for a couple of rounds.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.258
Cold drinks, warm conversation.

40:30.303 --> 40:31.509
You interested?

40:33.222 --> 40:37.090
I don't...really feel
like celebrating.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.851
You did great work, Sarah.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.063
Great work.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.783
For whatever it's worth...

40:58.623 --> 41:01.911
I think that
you should stay on.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.626
This is where you belong.
