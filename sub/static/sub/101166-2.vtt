00:23.064 --> 00:26.776
[man 1] The early eighties
was a golden era of our life, the Mob.

00:27.694 --> 00:31.740
New York was the seat of power
for that life all over America.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.750

with the numbers business,

01:14.491 --> 01:16.034

Police in New Jersey say the death
of two longshoreman officials

01:27.378 --> 01:29.422
may also be Mob-related.

The problem with what the Mafia had done,

01:31.758 --> 01:34.302
which no other organized
crime group ever did before,

01:34.385 --> 01:36.471
was instead of just being
an organized crime group,

01:36.554 --> 01:40.642
doing murder, doing extortion,
doing loan-sharking, doing gambling,

01:41.768 --> 01:45.313
they put their tentacles
into legitimate society.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.607
They controlled the fish market.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.277
They controlled restaurants
in New York City.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.405
They controlled the transportation
of our products.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.658
They controlled the garment industry.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.369
They had judges they put on the bench.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.830
They had hospitals they controlled.

[man 2]
The intention was to develop a RICO case

03:46.684 --> 03:48.811
against each of the Mafia families.

03:50.104 --> 03:53.858
We decided that we would tap
five family squads.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.153
And all the information
about that particular family

03:57.237 --> 03:59.239
would only go to that one squad.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.243
There was the Gambino squad,

04:03.326 --> 04:04.911
the Genovese squad,

04:04.994 --> 04:07.080
Colombo, Lucchese,

04:07.163 --> 04:08.706
and the Bonanno squad.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.884
The purpose of this was
to collect the information

04:19.968 --> 04:21.886
about each of those families,

04:22.887 --> 04:24.222
either from wiretaps,

04:24.764 --> 04:26.516
or from informants,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.351
or from surveillance,

04:28.935 --> 04:31.646
to go after the hierarchy of the family

04:31.729 --> 04:33.773
and their involvement
with the labor unions,

04:34.983 --> 04:36.734

[man 2] It was July of 1982.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.642
I'm assigned to the Colombo Squad.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.440
Gennaro Langella was acting boss
of the Colombo family.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.153
They were engaged in all the traditional
organized crime activities:

05:20.236 --> 05:21.654
loan-sharking,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.406
illegal gambling,

05:23.489 --> 05:25.783

05:28.870 --> 05:30.955
[Joyce] And, of course,
murder when they had to.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.625
But we needed evidence
to put together prosecutable cases.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.048
While we're surveilling Gennaro Langella,

05:40.131 --> 05:44.385
we see that on Fridays,
he would go to the Casa Storta restaurant.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.847
It was an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn.

05:48.556 --> 05:52.935
And it turned out to be a meeting place
for the hierarchy of the Colombo family.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.772
My supervisor says to me,

05:55.855 --> 05:57.815
"John, I have an assignment for you.

05:57.899 --> 06:02.945
You're gonna be charged with getting a bug
in the Casa Storta restaurant."

06:04.572 --> 06:09.494
The idea was to scope it out
and to figure out where to put this bug.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.915
I tried to be interested in the food,

06:13.998 --> 06:15.917
the table, and my date.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.128
But what I'm really looking around for
was where they're seated.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.924
Gennaro Langella and the Mob guys

06:23.007 --> 06:25.885
are in the banquet room
where they're playing cards.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.762
I tried to act as normal as possible.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.640
Typically, when you're in a restaurant,
you've gotta go to bathroom.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.978
The place is just swarming with Mob guys.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.440
I didn't look them in the eye.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.485
I didn't identify who was there,
what they were doing.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.821
I just wanted to see
where they were sitting.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.994
At that point, now you've got
a good layout of the place.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.331
You have a real good idea of where
they're spending their time

06:55.415 --> 06:57.208
and where to place the bug.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.139
[man] In Casa Storta,
we had some new challenges.

07:11.722 --> 07:14.142
We had a dog to deal with.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.518
Her name was Nina.

07:16.018 --> 07:20.398
She was about 150 pounds.
She was an Italian bullmastiff.

07:20.898 --> 07:24.735
And when you were having dinner,
Nina was walking around the restaurant,

07:24.819 --> 07:28.823
and if you didn't like the fact
that Nina was joining you for dinner,

07:29.824 --> 07:31.200
go eat some place else.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.414
You have to think like a criminal.

07:36.497 --> 07:40.001
And I saw that there was
no alarm-related issue to deal with.

07:40.084 --> 07:42.420
There was no back or side door

07:42.503 --> 07:44.630
that I could, you know, put ajar.

07:44.714 --> 07:48.259
There was nothing other than
we had to go in through the front door.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.475
First, we get the lock guys
to work on the locks.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.710
We're ready to do the entry,

08:23.377 --> 08:25.463
and instead of me being the first one in,

08:26.005 --> 08:29.091
Arthur with his injectable is gonna in.

08:29.175 --> 08:33.888
But he's having anxiety
over how old Nina is.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.848
He's not sure he should poke her,

08:35.932 --> 08:39.393
'cause none of us wants
to harm any animal.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.524
Once the door opens,
Nina backs up a little bit.

08:45.816 --> 08:49.487
He sticks his leg in the door
to sort of shoo her.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.407
[loud growling]

08:53.491 --> 08:56.327
[Cantamessa] She grabs his boot,

backs up,

08:57.662 --> 08:59.830
closing his leg in the door...

09:00.873 --> 09:02.166
and he is stuck.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.671
We have to protect ourselves.
The worst case, you'd have to shoot a dog.

Nina lets go,

09:19.684 --> 09:20.560
backs up,

09:21.852 --> 09:24.772
walks into the coat room,
and goes in her bed.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.899
Just like that.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.500
We get the job done,

09:45.001 --> 09:47.461
installing a microphone above the table...

09:49.338 --> 09:50.631
and we're out of there.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.226
[tape deck clicks, whirs]

10:07.273 --> 10:09.942
[Joyce] With a restaurant you have
a lot of ambient noise.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.987
Lots of people inside,
all talking at the same time,

10:13.070 --> 10:14.989
some of them talking very loudly...

10:15.072 --> 10:17.074

You have glasses clattering.

10:27.209 --> 10:30.713
So it presented a real challenge
listening to those Mob guys.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.968
But then we hear
Gennaro Langella, the underboss.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.857
[Joyce] At that point,
two Mob guys enter the restaurant,

10:50.483 --> 10:52.693
and we hear them being greeted.

10:53.653 --> 10:58.366
And I hear one of them say,
"That wire looks like it doesn't belong."

[typewriter clacking]

12:41.135 --> 12:43.471
[man 1] In 1981,

12:43.554 --> 12:48.100
I was asked to investigate
the Lucchese crime family's influence

12:48.184 --> 12:51.353
in the garbage collection industry
on Long Island.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.064
At that point we knew

12:54.148 --> 12:58.652
Tony "Ducks" Corallo was the boss
of the Lucchese crime family.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.909
[man 2] Tony "Ducks" grew up
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

13:04.992 --> 13:09.955
And he became a soldier many, many years
before and rose in the ranks.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.876
And he eventually took over
the crime family and became the boss.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.086
I was assigned to the unit

13:16.170 --> 13:19.173
that did backgrounds and intelligence
on organized crime.

13:19.965 --> 13:22.301
So we knew Tony "Ducks" was a character.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.224
His nickname was because he had
this ability to duck subpoenas,

13:28.307 --> 13:30.976
and when they were coming
to arrest him on something,

13:31.060 --> 13:32.019
he was never home.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.188
He was ducking out.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.861
He was cagey,

13:41.487 --> 13:42.696
real old-school.

13:43.614 --> 13:46.700
Not flashy. Didn't wear $2,000 suits,

13:47.451 --> 13:48.369

13:48.452 --> 13:51.205
But... a boss.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.002
[Goldstock] Our investigators
start making inroads

13:57.086 --> 13:59.171
into the Lucchese crime family.

13:59.255 --> 14:03.425
And we eventually worked our way up
from informants, to wire taps,

14:04.051 --> 14:08.264
to ultimately identifying Sal Avellino.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.644
[O'Hara] Sal Avellino was a soldier
in the Lucchese crime family.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.479
A Long Island guy.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.108
He drove a black Jaguar, four-door.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.279
[Goldstock]
We learned two things about Avellino.

14:23.362 --> 14:27.700
One is that he was the industry
specialist for garbage...

14:28.325 --> 14:29.994
in the Lucchese crime family.

14:30.578 --> 14:35.708
And the second thing was that he drove
Tony "Ducks" Corallo in his Jaguar.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.043
He became his chauffeur, his confidant.

14:38.794 --> 14:42.089
So we knew, obviously,
that they were discussing

14:42.172 --> 14:45.926
issues that would be of importance to us
and provide evidence for us.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.096
But to get the warrant,

14:49.179 --> 14:52.766
to put a bug in the car,
was extraordinarily difficult.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.690
[Goldstock] The question was
how you prove to a court

14:59.773 --> 15:02.735
that the two individuals in the car

15:02.818 --> 15:06.071
would be having conversations
about a particular crime.

15:12.369 --> 15:16.332
[Kossler] Ron Goldstock called me up and
he told me, "This is what we're doing."

15:16.415 --> 15:21.921
They needed probable cause to get
authority to put a bug in that Jaguar.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.548
I spoke to my agents.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.344
[man] Costa said,
"What do we know about this?"

15:28.427 --> 15:31.555
So I needed to see one
of my Lucchese informants.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.642
Meeting the informants
was always a concern,

15:34.725 --> 15:37.186
because the last thing
you needed to do was be seen...

15:37.269 --> 15:39.229
because that would be
the end of the informant.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.439
He would be killed.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.902
I had a hotel room in Midtown.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.948
I'd call the informants and say,
"Alright, meet me at the usual spot."

15:49.949 --> 15:51.533
What I needed to know:

15:51.617 --> 15:55.829
Does Anthony Corallo
discuss family business

15:55.913 --> 15:57.623
with Sal Avellino when they're driving?

15:58.499 --> 16:00.334
The answer is: "Yes, he does."

16:00.417 --> 16:03.754
And if you get a couple of sources,
very good sources,

16:03.837 --> 16:05.255
that say the same thing,

16:05.756 --> 16:09.802
that's enough to satisfy a judge
to get a warrant to bug the car.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.309
[O'Hara] The plan was

16:17.393 --> 16:21.105
to bug the Jaguar so that we could listen
to the conversations

16:21.188 --> 16:24.274
of designated people
while they were in that car.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.653
[Goldstock] It was only a question

16:27.736 --> 16:30.572
of how we were going to intercept
the conversations.

16:31.532 --> 16:34.159
And so, we got an identical car.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.830
And we started to work on the car.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.168
These were really superb technicians.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.840
They started taking it apart
and putting the bug in various places,

16:48.340 --> 16:49.925
then putting it back together again,

16:50.009 --> 16:53.345
testing it out, taking it on the road,
seeing where there was noise,

16:53.429 --> 16:54.972
seeing where there was interference,

16:55.055 --> 16:57.266
seeing where you could
get the best quality.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.145
And they determined
somewhere behind the heater.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.024
Once they knew where they wanted
to put the bug,

17:05.107 --> 17:06.775
now they started timing themselves.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.113
[ticking]

17:18.037 --> 17:18.912
And they did it again.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.002
And then they did it again.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.256
And then they did it again,

17:30.049 --> 17:31.383
until they were satisfied

17:31.467 --> 17:33.761
it was the fastest
they could possibly do it.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.221
The team was ready to bug the car.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.557
Now, we just had to wait
for the right opportunity.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.850
[thunder rumbles]

17:43.479 --> 17:47.858
[Goldstock] One night, Avellino
pulled his car into a location

17:47.941 --> 17:51.361
where there was some event
being conducted, and it was a rainy night.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.661
He came late, which meant
that the closer-in spots were taken.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.916
So he had to park
away from the building itself.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.336
We followed them into the building.

18:08.962 --> 18:10.631
Once we saw him go in,

18:10.714 --> 18:12.716
we gave the signal
for the tech team to go.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.844
[O'Hara] The opportunity was now.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.522
[Goldstock] Because it was raining,
they carried plastic with them.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.984
The door opened with the key
that we got from Jaguar.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.237
The plastic went in.

18:50.838 --> 18:54.174
We didn't know whether or not
the recording would actually work.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.176
[garbled speech]

19:16.155 --> 19:20.409
[O'Hara] The first day that we followed
the Jaguar was a learning process,

19:20.492 --> 19:24.705
because most wiseguys, Mafia guys,
they ride their rear<i> </i>view mirror.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.832
They want to see what's behind them.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.460
The van had the recording equipment,

19:30.544 --> 19:35.007
monitor, and the whereforall
to record all the conversations.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.885
And if they would've seen a blue van
too many times,

19:37.968 --> 19:40.429
they're certain to feel:
"Are we being followed?"

19:46.518 --> 19:48.770
[O'Hara] So we would have
three or four chase cars,

19:48.854 --> 19:50.898
all different makes, models, and colors.

19:50.981 --> 19:54.902
And they had a piece of equipment
in their car called a "repeater."

19:55.319 --> 19:58.739
The would receive the signal
being put out by the transmitter,

19:58.822 --> 20:04.494
and that repeater would increase
the power of the transmitter

20:04.578 --> 20:07.956
to allow the van
to be a little further away.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.292
[garbled chatter on radio]

20:10.375 --> 20:14.588
To keep the signal,
the repeater car had to stay close.

20:16.715 --> 20:21.345
[Alite] When you're driving a car,
the FBI was always on our mind.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.431
You know, a lot of people drive real fast
to see if they would follow,

20:24.514 --> 20:26.099
if there's several cars following you.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.685
Then there's guys that were
a little smarter. They would tell me,

20:28.769 --> 20:30.479
"What are you driving fast for?
Drive slow."

20:30.562 --> 20:32.314
If you drive real slow,

20:32.397 --> 20:35.150
you're gonna notice them,
'cause they're driving real slow.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.362
If they're gonna make
a right-hand turn down a street,

20:38.445 --> 20:40.656
you don't turn right behind them.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.617
You lay back. You kind of sneak up

20:43.700 --> 20:47.246
until he's into the next block
and you kind of take a peek.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.914
You're playin' hide and seek now.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.542
Sometimes, you might get a couple of cars
in between you and him.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.002
That could cause a problem.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.548
I'd think that we're too smart for them.
It ain't gonna be me.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.801
It'll be the next guy gettin' caught.
I won't get caught.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.345
So we would run red lights.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.724
[O'Hara]
If he makes the red light and we don't...

21:08.225 --> 21:10.519
Well, we don't wanna
wash out the whole day.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.605
So there were times when you might
have to go up on the sidewalk

21:13.689 --> 21:16.566
to get around cars
that are stopped for a red light

21:16.650 --> 21:18.902
and then carefully
go through the red light.

21:21.530 --> 21:25.951
Some take evasive action, such as going
around the block two or three times.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.161
Thank God Sal did not do it,

21:28.829 --> 21:31.665
which made following him a little easier.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.838
[garbled speech]

21:37.921 --> 21:39.423
[O'Hara] The bug was working.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.802
It was like hearing a novel
being read to you about the Mob.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.188
Sal went away one time.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.026
And when he came home from vacation
and he went to start his car,

21:59.735 --> 22:00.736
it didn't work.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.238
Oh, shit!

22:03.322 --> 22:07.367
We killed the battery,
because the bug was wired to the battery.

22:07.951 --> 22:12.039
So fortunately we had wiretaps
on a couple of telephones.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.335
And we heard Sal call the car company,
complaining.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.339
"I want you to come pick up the car
and fix it once and for all."

22:20.422 --> 22:22.591
So shit, how do we do this now?

22:22.674 --> 22:24.593
We gotta disconnect the bug,

22:24.676 --> 22:26.762
then they can do all the tests they want,

22:26.845 --> 22:30.390
and they won't find it,
because it won't be draining electricity.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.103
A flatbed comes
and drives away with the car.

22:35.771 --> 22:41.860
We had a uniformed Suffolk County
highway unit... stop the truck.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.655
And as luck would have it,
the driver of the tow truck

22:45.739 --> 22:47.824
had a suspended driver's license.

22:48.450 --> 22:52.537
So they got him away from his rig
and over towards the police car,

22:52.621 --> 22:56.291
which allowed one of our technicians
to get into the Jaguar,

22:56.375 --> 22:58.085
disconnect the bug,

22:58.168 --> 23:01.004
and get out,
all within about 45 seconds.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.967
That presented problem number two.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.677
How do we reconnect it?

23:13.850 --> 23:15.435
About two days later,

23:15.519 --> 23:18.313
Sal went to a meeting
with Tony "Ducks" to a restaurant,

23:18.897 --> 23:20.816
right off the Long Island Expressway.

23:22.484 --> 23:25.362
They were sitting in the window,
and they could see the parking lot.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.991
We pulled the van in
to block the view of the car.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.712
We confirmed the bug was working

23:42.796 --> 23:44.714
and off we went,
and we were running again.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.658
[O'Hara] The recordings
about the sanitation industry

24:11.741 --> 24:13.493
on Long Island were very important.

24:30.969 --> 24:35.849
Here, you're showing the influence,
the control of the Mafia over an industry.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.226
Total control over the industry.

24:38.310 --> 24:44.274
And the money, the economic harm
it was doing to commerce was astronomical.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.530
They controlled the association.
They controlled the union.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.159
So they controlled the basic cost
of picking up the garbage.

24:54.993 --> 24:57.412
I own a store.
I have to use this garbage guy.

24:57.496 --> 25:00.040
I have no choice,
and I have to pay him what he wants.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.833
There is no competition.

25:13.887 --> 25:17.182
If you don't cooperate with the Mob,
you might get killed.

25:18.266 --> 25:21.061
[reporter] <i>The sanitation men</i>
<i>had reported to work before 6:00.</i>

25:21.144 --> 25:25.190
<i>But then a quiet morning became violent</i>
<i>when a gunman entered the office.</i>

25:36.243 --> 25:39.371
[O'Hara] It was more than gold dust.
This was gold nuggets.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.749
The recordings that were being made
could take down

25:42.832 --> 25:44.668
the bosses of the Lucchese crime family.

25:50.006 --> 25:51.800
[Kossler] In the mid-'80s,
there came a time

25:51.883 --> 25:56.513
when we would have as many as 25 bugs
and wiretaps going in a given time.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.266
[man] <i>What if you can't prove</i>
<i>that he's a man of honor?</i>

25:59.349 --> 26:01.476
[overlapping indistinct chatter]

26:01.560 --> 26:03.436
[Kossler] We're getting a great picture.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.816
We were identifying
those industries and unions

26:08.316 --> 26:10.277
that had to be cleaned up.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.870
[Kossler] We had developed
a lot of evidence

26:20.954 --> 26:22.747
against two of the Five Families,

26:23.248 --> 26:26.876
but the Genovese family
was the most important above all else.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.463
They were the biggest Mafia family
in the country.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.133
If we were gonna take down the Mafia,

26:33.216 --> 26:35.260
we have to get Fat Tony Salerno.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.236
[typewriter clacking]

27:03.038 --> 27:08.209
[man] We started looking
at Fat Tony in 1983.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.923
From the perspective of the FBI,
looking at the Genovese family,

27:14.007 --> 27:17.344
Fat Tony Salerno was the ultimate target.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.264
For the most part,
while we were watching him,

27:21.348 --> 27:27.354
he was at the Palma Boys Social Club
on 115th Street in East Harlem,

27:27.937 --> 27:31.191
which was a strong Italian enclave.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.321
As a New Yorker,

27:36.404 --> 27:41.284
you saw the heartbreak of people that were
being targeted by organized crime.

27:41.951 --> 27:46.456
Mom and pop people who were trying to make
a go of it here<i> </i>were being shaken down.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.252
I just saw the Mob as...

27:51.336 --> 27:55.548
you know, vicious, vicious people
who were praying on victims, you know.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.592
So I took it personally, yeah, I did.

28:01.888 --> 28:07.811
We would conduct surveillances
just to see what Fat Tony's routine was.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.940
He would come in every Monday morning.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.652
And then he would go home
every Thursday morning.

28:15.735 --> 28:19.197
Those three days, he would spend
in the Palma Boys Social Club.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.950
If you've ever seen <i>The Godfather</i>

28:22.033 --> 28:24.452
when Marlon Brando is
at his daughter's wedding

28:24.536 --> 28:26.705
and people are being shuttled in
and shuttled out,

28:27.205 --> 28:28.331
that was Tony Salerno.

28:28.415 --> 28:32.168
He sat in that club, and neighbors would
come in, and they would have issues

28:32.252 --> 28:34.003
that they hoped that he would help.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.881
Tony was like a god in the community.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.800
He was like the fixer.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.723
[Franzese] I'll tell you a Fat Tony story.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.935
He sent for me one day,
so I go see him in his social club.

28:49.018 --> 28:51.730
He's sitting down, and he's got
the cigar and the fedora.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.232
And he says, "Michael,
let me ask you something."

28:54.315 --> 28:58.570
He says, "I got these five mamalukes
around me. They can't earn five cents."

28:58.653 --> 29:00.029
He says, "You give them a job?"

29:00.447 --> 29:03.450
I said, "Yeah, I'll give them a job, Tony.
Anything you want. You're the boss."

29:03.533 --> 29:05.952
He said, "How much you gonna
pay them every week?"

29:06.453 --> 29:08.580
So I'm thinking about it.
I don't wanna insult the boss.

29:08.663 --> 29:12.292
I said, "Tony how about I give them
1,500 in cash a week?"

29:12.375 --> 29:14.627
He looks at me and says, "1,500?"

29:14.711 --> 29:16.629
Give them 500. Give me the 1,000."

29:17.046 --> 29:19.507
I say, "Tony you got it. You're the boss.
Whatever you want."

29:20.550 --> 29:24.471
There was a presence about him that you
just knew he was the guy in control.

29:30.518 --> 29:34.022
[French] What we determined
through sources and informants

29:34.522 --> 29:39.611
was that he was meeting
with people from the various unions.

29:40.111 --> 29:45.992
They were also discussing gambling,
rackets, bribery, and family business.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.703
That gave us
some pretty good probable cause

29:48.787 --> 29:50.997
to figure that we could get
a court order for a bug.

29:57.253 --> 30:01.341
It was going to be a very big day
for this investigation.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.973
We saw Tony "Ducks" Corallo...

30:09.891 --> 30:12.018
walk into the Palma Boys Social Club.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.564
[Kossler] Tony "Ducks" Corallo,
the boss of the Lucchese family,

30:16.648 --> 30:21.319
was meeting with Fat Tony Salerno,
the boss of the Genovese family.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.530
And we had this on tape.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.332
All of a sudden, we're getting
these nuggets of great conversations.

30:47.554 --> 30:52.058
We started to realize there was
much more interaction between the bosses

30:52.141 --> 30:53.059
than we ever knew.

31:02.944 --> 31:07.156
At one point the boss
of the Buffalo family came to see Fat Tony

31:07.240 --> 31:12.745
and was describing the conflict
within the family, and Fat Tony told him,

31:12.829 --> 31:14.664
"Well, you go back and tell your people

31:14.747 --> 31:17.292
that Tony said this is coming
from the Commission."

31:30.555 --> 31:35.435
[overlapping chatter]

31:39.022 --> 31:44.068
[Kossler] The Commission was something
that informants had talked about for years

31:44.736 --> 31:49.032
and said that they controlled what
the organized crime families did

31:49.115 --> 31:50.325
and how they worked.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.462
[Kossler] From what we were hearing
on the bugs,

32:02.545 --> 32:06.716
we were getting a much better picture of
what the Commission was and what it did

32:06.799 --> 32:08.843
than we had ever done before.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.149
[Kossler] We learned the Commission
was made up

32:23.232 --> 32:25.777
of the bosses of the Five Families
in New York.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.489
They were there to set up the rules

32:29.572 --> 32:31.741
for all the families
all across the country,

32:32.325 --> 32:34.452
because disputes are bad for business.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.790
And the Commission was in the position
to settle disputes or to...

32:38.873 --> 32:41.334
order that somebody be killed
to settle a dispute.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.422
The conversations showed
that the five bosses in the Commission

32:46.506 --> 32:50.218
had a tremendous control of a lot
of different industries

32:50.301 --> 32:52.136
and legitimate businesses.

32:52.220 --> 32:55.932
And then, not only that,
the bosses were in business together.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.185
[Alite] A lot of times, different families

32:59.268 --> 33:02.021
work with each other,
depending on what the situation is.

33:02.105 --> 33:06.943
If it's something that the Commission
of the Mob agrees on,

33:07.026 --> 33:10.363
they'll send somebody
from any of the families or jointly.

33:10.446 --> 33:14.575
It's a collaboration of making money,
is what the street's about.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.494
It's not about fighting each other.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.912
It's not about killin' each other.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.248
At the end of the day,
it's about making a dollar together.

33:21.958 --> 33:25.336
[Kossler] The idea of the existence
of the Commission was a big deal

33:25.420 --> 33:28.006
because it puts all
the bosses of the family

33:28.089 --> 33:30.091
into the same criminal conspiracy.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.678
It became more and more apparent

33:33.761 --> 33:36.055
that this is really where
we should focus our efforts.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.644
<i>It's high noon Sunday,</i>
<i>and I'm Gabe Pressman.</i>

33:41.728 --> 33:44.022
<i>Just one year ago, Rudolph Giuliani</i>

33:44.105 --> 33:47.734
<i>was appointed US Attorney</i>
<i>for the Southern District of New York.</i>

33:47.817 --> 33:52.864
<i>It's been called the most prestigious</i>
<i>prosecutor's job in the United States.</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:56.492
<i>Giuliani has been described</i>
<i>as a man with a passion...</i>

33:56.576 --> 33:58.369
[Giuliani] I am an Italian-American.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.039
I was born in New York City.
I grew up in Brooklyn.

34:01.122 --> 34:05.668
I was a tough kid. I was a boxer.
I was taught not to be afraid of anything.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.672
Could have I ended up a wiseguy?

34:14.427 --> 34:15.845
Sure, I could have.

34:16.596 --> 34:19.599
But in the '70s,
I became an assistant US attorney.

34:19.682 --> 34:23.728
And when the position of US Attorney
of the Southern District opened up...

34:23.811 --> 34:24.937
that was my dream job.

34:26.189 --> 34:29.984
I got to see everything
the FBI were doing about organized crime.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.570
And I realized
they were being much more successful.

34:32.653 --> 34:34.822
They had a much better picture
of organized crime.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.367
I always hated the Mafia.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.204
They do terrible things to society.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.291
They began by exploiting
Italian immigrants...

34:45.875 --> 34:47.085
like my grandfathers.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.670
One was a barber. The other was a tailor.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.049
And the minute they established
a little business and made a little money,

34:53.132 --> 34:54.717
they'd come in and say, "Give us 30%."

34:55.468 --> 34:58.513
And you'd say,
"No. Why do I give you 30%?"

34:58.596 --> 35:00.890
"'Cause we're gonna burn you down
if you don't give us 30.

35:00.973 --> 35:03.017
We're gonna beat you up
or beat up your kid."

35:04.143 --> 35:06.854
When I began the position of US Attorney,

35:07.438 --> 35:10.525
I was reading all the files
I could about the Mafia cases.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.569
I got to this section
about the Commission.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.280
The Commission
is the executive board of the Mafia.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.742
They're the highest body
that governs the Mafia in New York.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.036
It's run like a business.
It's like a board meeting.

35:23.287 --> 35:26.290
So I envisioned the idea of using RICO

35:26.374 --> 35:30.253
to go after the bosses of
all these families in one very big case:

35:30.336 --> 35:31.587
the Commission Case.

35:32.421 --> 35:34.715
If you can kill
the monster from the head,

35:34.799 --> 35:36.384
this is our one chance to do it.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.761
[typewriter clacks]

35:41.806 --> 35:44.684
The US Attorney's Office has 150 lawyers.
They're all excellent.

35:44.767 --> 35:46.769
You've got about ten that are...

35:46.853 --> 35:47.854
really superstars.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.567
Mike Chertoff is one of those ten.

35:55.653 --> 35:59.323
[man 1] My unit chief said,
"You know, Rudy Giuliani has this idea

35:59.407 --> 36:02.285
of prosecuting the board of directors
of the Mafia.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.996
And he would like you
to work as his deputy."

36:05.496 --> 36:09.292
I'd been in the US Prosecutor's Office
for probably less than a year.

36:09.792 --> 36:12.837
I was, by any measure,
still a baby prosecutor.

36:14.338 --> 36:17.258
No question it was gonna be
a baptism of fire.

36:17.341 --> 36:18.926
I would be the lead prosecutor

36:19.010 --> 36:21.220
with the other two members
of the trial team,

36:21.304 --> 36:23.556
John Savarese and Gil Childers.

36:25.224 --> 36:29.020
[man 2] For me,
coming from an Italian-American heritage,

36:29.520 --> 36:34.400
the dark side of that immigrant history
that the Mafia represents

36:34.483 --> 36:36.485
was a horrible stain.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.947
And it was definitely part
of my own personal motivation

36:40.031 --> 36:41.616
for wanting to work on this case.

36:43.451 --> 36:45.536
[man 3] When I was asked to do this,

36:46.037 --> 36:47.705
I had just turned 29.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.333
It was quite a vote of confidence in us,

36:50.416 --> 36:53.419
but quite honestly,
mostly in Mike and John.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.132
The two of them had intellectual
candlepower that could light the city.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.513
[Savarese]
Rudy Giuliani really deserves credit

37:04.597 --> 37:06.182
for coming up with the idea

37:06.265 --> 37:09.101
of bringing a commission case
that would sit atop

37:09.185 --> 37:12.313
these Five Family cases
that were also being brought.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.523
It was really his brainstorm.

37:15.316 --> 37:19.320
He wanted to use RICO in a way
that had never been used before.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.991
I mean, this was probably
the biggest organized crime case ever.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.078
The question was "could we find
the evidence to make that case?"

37:29.038 --> 37:30.998
[DeVecchio]
The boss asked me to come to his office

37:31.082 --> 37:32.750
and said, "I got a case for you.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.794
We want to indict all of the bosses

37:34.877 --> 37:38.422
of the five organized crime families
in New York at the same time."

37:38.506 --> 37:42.510
I said, "What, are you shitting me?
You want what?"

37:42.593 --> 37:44.470
I mean, you're talking
about a major operation,

37:44.553 --> 37:47.640
all the bosses of all five families.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.475
And I wasn't sure how we were gonna do it.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.604
[Savarese] To make a RICO case,
you've gotta show

37:53.688 --> 37:55.940
that it's an independent enterprise,

37:56.023 --> 37:58.484
that there is this thing
called the Commission.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.322
[DeVecchio] My agents went to every squad

38:03.406 --> 38:06.575
and got
transcripts of every wiretap, every bug.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.203
Was the Commission mentioned?

38:09.704 --> 38:11.539
How was it mentioned?

38:11.622 --> 38:13.582
What contacts between who?

38:14.083 --> 38:16.502
And then... what did they discuss?

38:25.011 --> 38:29.265
[Savarese] You got to show that
these individuals are connected to it,

38:29.348 --> 38:32.601
they want to be part of it,
and they're lending their effort to it.

38:37.690 --> 38:42.069
Second, you got to connect it
to a series of underlying crimes.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.238
So what were those crimes?

38:50.828 --> 38:54.206
What really proved critical
was the investigation

38:54.290 --> 38:56.042
of the Casa Storta restaurant.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.923
[Joyce] I had been charged
with getting a bug

39:03.007 --> 39:04.550
in the Casa Storta restaurant...

39:06.218 --> 39:09.597
the meeting place for the Colombo family.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.392
But they found the first bug.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.854
So we had to have the entry team
get back in there, reconnect the wires,

39:16.937 --> 39:19.148
hide them a little better
than the last time,

39:19.231 --> 39:21.233
and do it all-- start all over again.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.032
[tape deck clicks]

39:28.115 --> 39:30.117
[indistinct sounds playing
over headphones]

39:32.536 --> 39:36.499
And we started getting conversations that
had some value to the Commission case.

39:41.087 --> 39:42.213
[clicks]

39:43.923 --> 39:44.757
[clicks]

40:03.442 --> 40:06.028
You're hearing references
to Paul Castellano,

40:06.112 --> 40:07.822
boss of the Gambino family,

40:07.905 --> 40:09.990
references to Tony "Ducks."

40:10.074 --> 40:13.285
Tony "Ducks" Corallo, he's the boss
of the Lucchese family.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.746
You're hearing references
to Fat Tony Salerno,

40:15.830 --> 40:17.790
boss of the Genovese family.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.922
And then I hear, they're throwing out
all these other names.

40:44.191 --> 40:47.111
North Berry, S&A, X.L.O.

40:47.862 --> 40:48.863
What was that?

40:49.488 --> 40:51.490
And they were using these names

40:51.574 --> 40:54.493
in the context
of various intersections in Manhattan.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.914
Thirty-fourth and First.

40:59.957 --> 41:00.958
York Avenue.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.335
We had no idea
what they were talking about.

41:03.419 --> 41:06.589
We knew it was important, because they're
talking about the bosses of the family.

41:23.647 --> 41:26.734
North Berry, S&A, X.L.O.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.028
My boss picks up the phone book.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.490
He looks up X.L.O.
He looks up North Berry.

41:32.573 --> 41:35.326
He said,
"These are all construction companies,

41:35.409 --> 41:37.578
and they're all in the cement business."

41:37.995 --> 41:41.499
He said, "This is unbelievable.
He says, "This is the concrete industry.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.042
This is construction in Manhattan."

41:46.045 --> 41:48.547
So we went out to 34th and 1st.

41:50.591 --> 41:54.178
Saw that it was
an enormous construction project,

41:54.261 --> 41:55.930
a giant hole in the ground.

41:57.723 --> 41:58.891
It's gonna be huge.

42:00.142 --> 42:03.854
This is multimillion dollars.
This is big leagues.

42:03.938 --> 42:06.273
So we know then we're onto something big.

42:07.566 --> 42:11.362
Construction in Manhattan
at that time was mind-boggling.

42:11.445 --> 42:15.032
There was buildings going up
almost on every block.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.577
The city was offering
tax incentives for construction.

42:19.370 --> 42:22.414
Hundreds of millions of dollars
of construction underway

42:22.498 --> 42:23.666
at any given time.

42:24.416 --> 42:28.629
This game was making the Mob
tens of millions of dollars on one job.

42:29.255 --> 42:31.006
And there was 50 jobs.

42:31.924 --> 42:35.636
The complexity of the conspiracy
was stunning.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.806
We're literally talking
a billion-dollar operation.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.141
But once we figured it out,

42:41.225 --> 42:43.978
then we were able to bring a case
against the Commission itself.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.906
[intense instrumental music playing]
