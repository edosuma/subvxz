but I do need to score some
points with the boss, so...

09:54.261 --> 09:56.194
KIM ( <i>coughing</i> ):
Who are you?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.430
Hank Perkins. Hello!

09:58.432 --> 09:59.664
Do you work here?

09:59.666 --> 10:01.766
Well, I am a temp,
but a little birdie

10:01.768 --> 10:03.568
told me I might be kept on.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.507
( <i>grunts</i>)

10:09.509 --> 10:12.344
( <i>buzzing</i> ) ( <i>boys grunt</i> )

10:12.346 --> 10:13.712
Wow, looks like somebody's

10:13.714 --> 10:15.680
been drinking lots of fluids...

10:15.682 --> 10:17.849
and retaining every ounce.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.417
So not in the mood, Shego.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.691
( <i>both sneeze</i>)

10:26.693 --> 10:27.826
Gesundheit.

10:27.828 --> 10:28.593
Thanks.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.364
DRAKKEN:
Come on, Shego!

10:32.366 --> 10:33.565
Show her who's boss!

10:33.567 --> 10:35.600
Uppercut! Uppercut!

10:44.810 --> 10:46.244
( <i>yells</i> )

10:46.246 --> 10:49.347
Snug as a flu bug in a rug.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.548
( <i>growls</i> )

10:50.550 --> 10:52.884
Okay, I am officially resigning,

10:52.886 --> 10:54.886
uh, so if someone
could just write me

10:54.888 --> 10:57.188
a quick letter...

10:57.190 --> 10:59.257
BOTH:
Wrong chandelier!

10:59.259 --> 11:01.760
I'll just, uh... run!

11:03.863 --> 11:04.729
Yes!
Yes!

11:04.731 --> 11:06.264
No!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.266
KILLIGAN:
Are you daft, man?

11:08.268 --> 11:10.635
Just 'cause you have her brain
in your head

11:10.637 --> 11:13.338
doesn't mean you can't love her.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.207
KIM:
<i>Okay, good news, bad news.</i>

11:16.209 --> 11:18.376
We managed to keep Ray-X out
of the clutches of evil.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.511
Excellent!

11:19.513 --> 11:21.279
And, uh, uh, the bad news?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.214
It sort of got a little crushed

11:23.216 --> 11:25.183
on the way out of
the clutches of evil.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.585
I got to know.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.321
What was this X thing
designed to do, anyway?

11:31.424 --> 11:33.291
BOTH:
Cure the common cold.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.960
I <i>hate</i> irony.
