00:00.301 --> 00:04.770
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:08.340
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.209
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:11.944
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:16.015
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.017 --> 00:17.883
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.885 --> 00:22.621
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.623 --> 00:26.058
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:29.628
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.630 --> 00:31.530
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:34.099
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.569 --> 00:38.771
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.773 --> 00:41.006
Hank henshaw:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:41.008 --> 00:44.810
Cat: <i> She broke a story and</i>
<i> then gave it to my</i>
<i> biggest competitor.</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:48.380
You are fired!

00:48.382 --> 00:50.215
Alex: <i> You were exposed</i>
<i> to red kryptonite.</i>

00:50.217 --> 00:51.850
It's altered your brain.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.619
(Explodes)

00:57.391 --> 00:59.058
Kara: <i> I scared</i>
<i> the whole city...</i>

00:59.060 --> 01:01.794
And now I'm so afraid
that I'm never gonna
win them back.

01:04.999 --> 01:11.336
Reporter: (On TV) <i> What was</i>
<i> once a symbol of hope</i>
<i> is now a symbol of fear.</i>

01:11.338 --> 01:14.540
<i> Early this morning,</i>
<i> Supergirl arrived at</i>
<i> the scene of a crime</i>

01:14.542 --> 01:16.675
<i> at west national city bank.</i>

01:16.677 --> 01:18.644
<i> But instead of</i>
<i> the usual cheers,</i>

01:18.646 --> 01:22.414
<i> Supergirl's intervention was</i>
<i> met with skepticism and fear.</i>

01:26.954 --> 01:30.189
<i> Some say Supergirl was</i>
<i> under a mind-altering drug</i>

01:30.191 --> 01:32.558
<i> when she attacked the city.</i>

01:32.560 --> 01:34.493
<i> But she turned against</i>
<i> our people once.</i>

01:34.495 --> 01:36.662
<i> The question on</i>
<i> everyone's minds,</i>

01:36.664 --> 01:39.498
<i> what's to stop her from</i>
<i> turning against us again?</i>

01:41.535 --> 01:44.937
First Sandy bullock steals
my bike at spin class

01:44.939 --> 01:49.842
and then the juice bar runs
out of chard, and now this?

01:49.844 --> 01:52.244
I knew people would be
slow to forgive Supergirl,

01:52.246 --> 01:53.545
but this is ridiculous.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.814
And now the crime rate
in national city

01:55.816 --> 01:57.616
is up a whopping 40%.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.185
Do you think Supergirl
has lost the public's
trust for good?

02:00.187 --> 02:02.321
Well, I suppose if Mel Gibson

02:02.323 --> 02:03.655
can present at
the golden globes,

02:03.657 --> 02:05.424
then Supergirl
can win the city back.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.093
This too shall pass.

02:08.095 --> 02:12.564
Kara, go find me
a juice bar with an
abundance of chard.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.866
Uh, Ms. Grant,

02:13.868 --> 02:17.136
I already told you,
Kara's out sick today.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.605
That was at 9 am

02:19.607 --> 02:22.875
generally, when people are
sick it lasts the whole day.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.878
Well, that is unacceptable.
Who will man the phones?

02:28.149 --> 02:29.381
I guess I will.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.850
-(Cell phone vibrates)
-Oh.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.486
You know, just as
soon as I get back

02:34.488 --> 02:36.889
from this thing I have to do.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.327
(Telephone rings)

02:45.966 --> 02:47.699
(James sighs)

02:47.701 --> 02:49.902
(Ringing continues)

02:54.842 --> 02:55.908
Cat Grant's office.

02:59.146 --> 03:03.549
That four-eyed bitch in
a kilt ruined my life.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.752
Look, what's, uh, what's
really going on?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.420
No one will hire me.

03:08.422 --> 03:11.557
I've sent my resume out to
every media outlet in town.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.092
And when I call to follow up,
they're polite on the phone

03:14.094 --> 03:15.727
until they hear my name

03:15.729 --> 03:18.197
and then, dial tone.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.565
That's weird. Why?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.402
Because that blond mean
girl ratted me out

03:23.404 --> 03:24.903
to the queen of all media.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.472
Oh, Siobhan, that's crazy.

03:27.474 --> 03:32.110
No. What's crazy is that
I've spent my entire life

03:32.112 --> 03:34.179
trying to be a journalist,

03:34.181 --> 03:37.182
and in one fell swoop,

03:37.184 --> 03:39.484
Kara danvers dashed
all my dreams.

03:39.486 --> 03:44.423
I hate her, I hate her,
i hate her.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.891
Okay, listen.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.660
You just had a setback, okay?

03:48.662 --> 03:52.397
And you know what?
All powerful people
have setbacks.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.567
So, you just focus on
what you really want.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.538
You know what?
Once you have a goal,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.807
nothing's gonna stop you from
going out and getting it.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.843
You're right.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.746
Nothing can stop me.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.716
Thanks, winn.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.854
Man: (On TV) <i> The real question</i>
<i> is the identity of the alien</i>

04:15.856 --> 04:19.057
<i> who defeated Supergirl</i>
<i> during her reign of terror.</i>

04:19.059 --> 04:20.792
<i> Who is this scary, powerful</i>

04:20.794 --> 04:22.995
<i> and potentially</i>
<i> dangerous monster?</i>

04:34.942 --> 04:37.876
You don't look so dangerous
shoving chocos in your face.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.546
(Smacking)

04:41.548 --> 04:43.482
How did you know they
were my favorite?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.121
Only a favorite
will do at 3 am.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.455
You have to stop these visits.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.457
I like taking care
of you for once.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.828
My mission as Hank henshaw
was to protect you.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.730
Missions change.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.198
Not this one.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.834
Which is why I'm telling you,
you have to distance yourself.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.873
Don't check in on me.
Stop bringing me cookies.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.841
Just say you never
knew about me.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.977
Say I betrayed you.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.312
I would never do that.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.749
There has to be
a reckoning, Alex.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.019
An alien lied and took command
of a government organization.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.255
This doesn't end in
people getting fired,

05:23.257 --> 05:24.523
or even going to jail.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.628
People get disappeared
for this sort of thing.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.866
They're gonna tear
this place apart looking
for whoever helped me.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.469
I'll lie.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.705
I'll convince.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.273
I will do everything that
you taught me to do.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.941
But I'm not abandoning you.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.445
This is rock bottom.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.415
And I know what kind
of person I'm gonna be.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.652
(Door opens)

05:53.654 --> 05:56.088
Ma'am, you need to come
out here right now.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.895
Major Lane?

06:03.897 --> 06:05.163
What are you doing here?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.431
She's with me.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.534
And who are you?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.970
Colonel James Harper.
United States marines corps.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.973
The Pentagon ordered a joint
task force to investigate

06:14.975 --> 06:17.709
j'onn j'onzz's infiltration
of this agency.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.579
They wanna know what he's done
and who knew about it.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.048
So everyone here
will be interviewed.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.052
All activities,
all communications
scrutinized.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.453
Sounds like a witch-hunt.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.988
This is an
internal investigation

06:29.990 --> 06:32.724
done by the book
to identify, remove

06:32.726 --> 06:34.993
and ultimately prosecute
enemies of the state.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.062
And you're here as
our legal counsel

06:37.064 --> 06:38.730
to protect our civil rights?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.565
Harper: She's here
because this
investigation required

06:40.567 --> 06:43.368
someone familiar
with the players,

06:43.370 --> 06:46.438
someone the government
could trust to help cut
through the subterfuge.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.575
I'm concerned everyone here
has been compromised by him.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.411
You should be too.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.714
Which is why we need to
figure out who knew what when,

06:55.716 --> 06:58.350
and uncover anything
j'onn j'onzz

06:58.352 --> 07:00.619
and his confederates
were planning.

07:01.989 --> 07:05.357
We'll deal with the question
of your loyalties later.

07:05.359 --> 07:07.025
Take the martian to
the interrogation room.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.827
-We start with him.
-Man: Yes, sir.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.034
(Door opens)

07:20.574 --> 07:21.840
Harper: Marines.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.379
Lucy. Jim.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.381
It's nice to see you.

07:29.383 --> 07:30.916
You are looking well.

07:30.918 --> 07:34.886
Ah, I look the same as
i always have.

07:34.888 --> 07:38.623
But, obviously, looks
can be deceiving.

07:40.661 --> 07:45.764
For ten years you have
been in my home,

07:45.766 --> 07:50.635
you've been around
my children.
My children...

07:50.637 --> 07:52.838
And you haven't been
who you said you were.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.675
Or what you said you were.

07:58.745 --> 08:02.147
I want you to know i
intend to fully cooperate
with your investigation.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.484
(Scoffs) What, so you
can plant false
thoughts in our brains?

08:07.020 --> 08:08.887
I know what you can do.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.022
And what you can't do anymore.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.696
You smell that?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.165
Smells kind of like
burnt rubber, right?

08:21.602 --> 08:23.869
It's a little something
my team came up with.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.937
We're generating
a stasis field.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.707
It keeps you from
shifting out of that body

08:28.709 --> 08:30.775
or using your powers.

08:32.980 --> 08:37.048
So I hope you like
that body, j'onn j'onzz,

08:37.050 --> 08:39.718
because you're gonna be in it
until I'm done with you.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.862
What can you hear?

08:52.599 --> 08:54.332
(Sharp screech)

08:54.334 --> 08:55.734
(Grunts)

08:55.736 --> 08:57.636
What? What's wrong?

08:59.139 --> 09:00.605
They've done something.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.140
They're blocking me out.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.811
Tell us what happened to
the real Hank henshaw.

09:11.818 --> 09:15.020
Ancient greeks had Hades.
The Egyptians, Anubis.

09:15.022 --> 09:18.356
The incas, supay,
the lord of the underworld,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.025
god of death.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.927
Today, the villagers that live
among the ruins of that empire

09:21.929 --> 09:24.296
believe that supay has
returned to live amongst them.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.566
But this creature is no devil,

09:28.835 --> 09:31.169
it is an alien fugitive,

09:32.105 --> 09:33.305
the manhunter.

09:33.307 --> 09:36.474
One we've been hunting for
for so long.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.910
And we've finally found it.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.313
It triggered one of our
remote outpost probes

09:41.315 --> 09:43.682
where the Peruvian Amazon
meets the eastern andes.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.885
That is where
we shall find our quarry.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.421
This thing is the most
dangerous fugitive

09:49.423 --> 09:51.056
we have ever faced.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.326
Your mission is shoot-to-kill.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.328
Gear up, gentlemen.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.635
Sir, if this creature really
is as old as you say,

10:03.637 --> 10:06.471
imagine what it's seen,
what it might know.

10:06.473 --> 10:09.274
The only thing I wanna know
is the color of its blood.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.611
So check your bleeding heart
at the armory and man up,

10:12.613 --> 10:14.279
agent danvers.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.831
Thermal tracker indicates
the target has been active

10:32.833 --> 10:35.100
within a two mile radius.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.503
Prepare to put up a fight.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.839
He will not go quietly.

10:42.376 --> 10:44.142
Let's move out.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.330
(Snake rattles)

11:07.367 --> 11:09.167
(Grunts)

11:09.636 --> 11:11.102
(Hissing)

11:32.359 --> 11:33.358
They've been in
there for hours.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.693
We have to get in there.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.662
And implicate ourselves
as accessories?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.864
We won't be any use to Hank
if they lock us up with him.

11:39.866 --> 11:43.501
I'd like to see them
try and lock me up.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.272
You can't expect us to believe
you saved Jeremiah danvers.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.107
He was on a mission
to kill you.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.276
You asked for the truth.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.144
Harper: What is truth
to you, j'onn?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.479
Huh?

11:54.481 --> 11:56.848
Wearing skin that
doesn't belong to you?

11:56.850 --> 12:00.752
Or pretending to be someone
or something you're not?

12:00.754 --> 12:04.022
I did not kill
Jeremiah danvers.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.323
Then how did he die?

12:14.334 --> 12:17.102
(Sighs) Fire won't kill you.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.438
But it will prevent me from
freezing to death tonight.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.373
Unless you're
willing to cuddle.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.255
You don't like fire, do you?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.258
My planet burned to death.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.661
What planet are you from?

12:43.663 --> 12:44.796
Mars.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.167
So there is life on Mars.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.973
Was.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.342
How many others escaped?

12:58.111 --> 12:59.711
I am the last.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.413
I'm sorry.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.649
You are here to kill me.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.251
No. No, no, no.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.854
The agency that I work for,

13:09.856 --> 13:12.323
they pinned you as a threat.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.326
That was before you saved me.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.663
Before I learned that
you're not a danger.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.299
You're a refugee.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.736
Like my daughter.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.813
This one, here,

13:34.815 --> 13:36.247
Kara.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.151
She's adopted.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.554
She's not from here either.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.293
That one, Alex.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.261
She's tough.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.431
They both are,
in their own way.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.166
Alex.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.801
Kara.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.012
I too had daughters.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.452
When I link back up
with my team,

14:14.454 --> 14:16.321
I'm gonna explain to them

14:16.323 --> 14:18.256
who you are, and
what you did for me.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.724
I'm not a threat.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.592
I know that.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.194
But humans can be ignorant.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.496
Especially when
they're scared.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.533
But I will do
everything in my power

14:28.535 --> 14:30.301
to help keep you safe.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.604
Help you find your place here.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.573
I'm Jeremiah danvers.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.409
You can consider me a friend.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.519
I am j'onn j'onzz.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.358
Someone is here.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.792
-(Gunshot)
-(Screams)

14:54.794 --> 14:56.594
-Jeremiah: No, no, no. Stop.
-Hank: I got him!

14:56.596 --> 14:58.897
Stop, stop, stop!
No, he... stop!

14:58.899 --> 15:02.000
-(Groaning)
-Jeremiah: Hank...

15:02.002 --> 15:05.470
I designed these bullets
especially for you, martian.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.573
Hank...

15:08.575 --> 15:12.110
"The most powerful being on
the face of this earth."

15:12.112 --> 15:13.645
You know who called you that?

15:14.814 --> 15:16.381
Superman.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.449
Sure means something,
coming from him.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.252
-I mean you no harm.
-(Gunshot)

15:21.254 --> 15:22.954
No! Hank, stop.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.355
Please.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.660
Heard a rumor you
could regenerate.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.229
Best finish you off quick.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.530
Stop. He's a good man.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.065
He's a good... (Grunts)

15:34.801 --> 15:35.934
He's not a man.

15:40.907 --> 15:44.108
(Grunting and straining)

15:49.149 --> 15:51.382
(Hank screaming)

15:56.022 --> 15:57.088
(Groans)

16:05.031 --> 16:06.631
Take care of my girls.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.617
Welcome back,
director henshaw.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.986
It's good to be back.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.495
From that day forward,
i took on the responsibility

16:37.497 --> 16:39.197
of being the director
of the deo.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.332
And this "disguise"

16:41.334 --> 16:44.602
actually allowed me
to prevent many
actual alien attacks.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.739
I dedicated my life to
protecting this world.

16:47.741 --> 16:50.108
And if you wanna take me
down for being different,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.242
so be it.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.044
This isn't about
being different.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.246
Maybe you planned to
build an alien army.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.814
But why?

16:56.816 --> 16:59.484
Who better to protect earth
from aliens than an alien?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.285
What better place to
take down our world

17:01.287 --> 17:04.555
than from inside the
organization tasked
with protecting it?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.958
All I've done is bring
honor to this department,

17:06.960 --> 17:08.026
to this name.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.264
Before I came along,
Hank henshaw was a
sorry excuse for a man.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.966
Hank henshaw

17:14.968 --> 17:17.335
was my best friend.

17:17.337 --> 17:20.905
And he dedicated his life
to keeping this country safe.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.842
And you murdered him.

17:24.844 --> 17:26.911
I think we have
everything we need.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.885
Where are you taking him?

17:34.654 --> 17:36.154
Hey, you need to step back.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.923
I've worked for that man
for the last two years.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.859
He's never endangered this
planet. He's protected it.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.027
Two years?

17:43.029 --> 17:45.196
This alien is over
300 years old.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.798
Two years is like a
coffee break to him.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.867
He saved my life more
times than I can count.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.570
He's the best, most
honorable man that I know.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.405
-He's not a man.
-Where are you taking him?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.941
Where he belongs.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.877
And danvers, since you have
so much to say about him,

17:59.879 --> 18:01.179
you're next.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.391
You don't have to thank me
for the shower gift, Kate.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.494
But you might wanna ask
your grandmother-in-law

18:16.496 --> 18:19.664
to reconsider her rule
about Americans

18:19.666 --> 18:21.466
not receiving damehoods.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.234
(Elevator dings)

18:52.866 --> 18:54.565
Dear Ms. Grant,

18:54.567 --> 18:59.670
I've been your assistant for
a shockingly long time.

18:59.672 --> 19:03.741
But I've never let you know
how I really feel about you.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.416
You were director henshaw's
right hand.

19:12.418 --> 19:15.786
I find it hard to believe that
he kept you in the dark.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.756
Or that you'd allow yourself
to be kept in the dark.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.791
Turn it on.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.794
Ask your questions. I've got
nothing to hide, colonel.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.329
We'll see about that.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.238
Is your name
Alexandra danvers?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.808
Alex. Yes.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.076
(Machine beeps softly)

19:46.920 --> 19:48.186
Vasquez,

19:49.589 --> 19:52.156
I have to hear what's
going on in that room.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.425
Can you disable the
sound-dampening tech

19:54.427 --> 19:55.693
they're running to block me?

19:57.964 --> 19:59.430
I can't disable it.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.332
I won't.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.436
Colonel Harper
and major Lane
have a job to do.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.072
And frankly, ma'am,
i suggest you let them do it.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.516
Did you know that Hank henshaw

20:18.518 --> 20:20.985
was being impersonated
by an alien criminal

20:20.987 --> 20:22.253
when you were recruited?

20:22.989 --> 20:24.355
He is not a criminal.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.591
Answer the question,
agent danvers.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.859
I did not know that Hank
was being impersonated

20:28.861 --> 20:32.096
by an alien refugee
when I was being
recruited to the deo.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.699
(Machine beeps softly)

20:34.701 --> 20:39.070
The man who recruited me,
the man that I believed
to be Hank henshaw,

20:39.072 --> 20:40.838
he saved my life.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.708
(Club music playing)

21:05.965 --> 21:07.798
(Car alarm blaring)

21:07.800 --> 21:09.166
(Deactivates alarm)

21:12.372 --> 21:14.171
(Police siren wails)

21:27.320 --> 21:30.154
Alex danvers.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.189
I didn't ask to
talk to a lawyer.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.527
It's a good thing
I'm not a lawyer.

21:38.231 --> 21:39.497
Are you a priest then?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.333
You're wasting your time.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.068
I'm not exactly
a prime candidate

21:44.070 --> 21:46.203
for jailhouse conversion.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.738
I wouldn't think so.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.374
Scientists are
generally skeptics.

21:50.376 --> 21:53.044
Not that you're much of
a scientist these days,

21:53.046 --> 21:56.180
that is, if your
latest transcripts
are any indication.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.016
How do you know about that?

21:59.018 --> 22:03.087
Hank: (Scoffs) I know a lot
of things about you, Alex.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.056
I know about your
house in midvale,

22:05.058 --> 22:07.892
where every night you'd watch
the stars from your roof.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.163
I know how you got that
scar on your arm.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.900
And I know about your sister.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.338
What about my sister?

22:23.076 --> 22:25.142
It's hard, isn't it?

22:25.144 --> 22:28.846
Someone comes into
your life with these
extraordinary powers,

22:28.848 --> 22:31.449
and you feel like you
can never measure up.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.718
Like there's nothing
special about you.

22:35.421 --> 22:37.688
You are special, Alex.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.958
And you can't afford to throw
your life down the drain.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.660
You owe that to yourself.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.630
And your father.

22:48.101 --> 22:49.266
Who are you?

22:49.268 --> 22:51.836
My name is Hank henshaw.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.372
I work for a government
organization dedicated

22:54.374 --> 22:56.273
to defending this planet.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.478
And we need you, Alex.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.914
We need you to be the
person I know you can be.

23:10.957 --> 23:14.425
For the next five months,
you will be spending
12 hours a day training.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.227
Training for what?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.763
Anything. Everything.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.498
You're gonna be fighting
attacks from creatures

23:20.500 --> 23:22.133
from all over the universe.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.769
You need to be
ready for whatever
happens out there.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.904
(Chuckles)
When will I be ready?

23:28.441 --> 23:30.274
When you can beat me.

23:32.245 --> 23:36.213
Hank henshaw or
j'onn j'onzz, or whatever
you wanna call him

23:36.215 --> 23:37.948
gave me a home.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.917
A purpose.

23:39.919 --> 23:44.889
I served him with honor,
and I'm proud of that.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.224
You're the ones who should
be ashamed of yourselves.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.860
Well, that's all
very heartwarming,

23:49.862 --> 23:52.329
but it still doesn't answer
the million-dollar question.

23:53.666 --> 23:56.901
Did you know that
Hank henshaw was an alien?

23:58.971 --> 24:00.271
No.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.907
(Machine beeps softly)

24:05.311 --> 24:07.745
(Sighs)

24:07.747 --> 24:10.014
Well, congratulations,
agent danvers.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.716
The only thing you're guilty
of is being duped by the very

24:12.718 --> 24:14.518
<i> creature you were</i>
<i> meant to be hunting.</i>

24:14.520 --> 24:17.221
Which makes you
a terrible agent.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.457
But lucky for you,
not a criminal.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.362
Wait.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.765
She's lying.

24:29.735 --> 24:33.170
He told you he tried
to rescue your father.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.506
He told you he's
protecting you.

24:35.508 --> 24:38.576
He made you believe he
was the father you lost.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.277
And now you're under arrest.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.645
(Door opens)

24:48.187 --> 24:49.453
Hey!

24:50.356 --> 24:51.789
What the hell is going on?

24:52.525 --> 24:53.557
You can't do this.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.059
Where is she going?

24:55.061 --> 24:57.795
Same place I'm taking
your little green friend.

24:58.397 --> 24:59.864
Project cadmus.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.298
Kara: Cadmus?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.033
What is project cadmus?

25:05.271 --> 25:06.937
What is project cadmus?

25:16.349 --> 25:18.182
Hey, I got your message.
What, what happened?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.450
It was horrible. They just...

25:19.452 --> 25:21.318
They just dragged Alex
and Hank away.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.920
Okay. But, who is they?

25:22.922 --> 25:24.021
Who did this?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.290
(Sighs) Lucy.

25:26.292 --> 25:29.660
Wait, hold on. Lucy is
back here in national city?

25:29.662 --> 25:31.128
Yes. With a colonel Harper.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.630
They're leading
the witch-hunt.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.765
They wanna know who
knew about Hank.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.300
I've never seen her like this.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.569
Okay, but where did they
take Alex and Hank?

25:38.571 --> 25:40.471
Some place called
project cadmus,

25:42.241 --> 25:44.909
which I'm guessing
isn't an all-inclusive resort.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.012
No. It's the reason
that Clark won't work
with the government.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.413
Okay, so if,

25:49.415 --> 25:52.249
if the deo is a prison, then
cadmus is a dissection lab.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.452
It's genetic engineering
facility that treats
aliens like lab rats.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.321
Amputated. Skinned. Drained.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.522
Injected with
experimental drugs.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.724
Why would they do that?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.627
Weaponizing alien abilities
for military purposes.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.496
What do they do to humans?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.002
Does Clark know where it is?

26:12.004 --> 26:13.904
No. No one does.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.442
I know what I have to do.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.010
But I'm gonna need your help.

26:22.214 --> 26:23.480
(Knock at door)

26:27.553 --> 26:29.186
I don't have time for this.

26:30.222 --> 26:31.589
So you're back in the army.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.157
And you're back
in Kara's loft.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.759
I guess nothing's really
changed for either of us.

26:38.531 --> 26:40.297
Just tell me what
was so important

26:40.299 --> 26:41.498
that I had to come here.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.900
What is this all about?

26:45.671 --> 26:47.471
There's something
you need to know.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.776
(Gasps)

27:01.087 --> 27:03.087
It all makes sense now.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.624
I just didn't wanna
put it together.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.727
I didn't want it to be true.

27:09.729 --> 27:12.830
I'm sorry you had to
find out this way.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.000
But you're the only person
that can stop Hank and Alex

27:16.002 --> 27:18.068
from being sent
to project cadmus.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.536
Why would I help you?

27:19.538 --> 27:22.139
You and Hank...

27:22.141 --> 27:23.707
Why do you all lie?

27:27.046 --> 27:29.380
When you're an alien,

27:29.382 --> 27:30.881
and you've lost your world

27:30.883 --> 27:33.417
and you're dropped
into a new one,

27:33.419 --> 27:35.686
you don't have a choice.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.494
(School bell rings)

27:43.496 --> 27:45.429
(Sharp screech)

27:45.431 --> 27:47.831
-(Loud distorted noises)
-(Breathing heavily)

27:51.537 --> 27:52.569
Girl: <i> Who's the new girl?</i>

27:52.571 --> 27:53.871
<i> Foster kid.</i>

27:53.873 --> 27:55.539
<i> Alex danvers' parents</i>
<i> took her in.</i>

27:55.541 --> 27:57.975
<i> -I'd hate my parents if</i>
<i> they did that to me.</i>
<i> -Totally.</i>

27:57.977 --> 27:59.977
<i> Who wants a stranger</i>
<i> living in their room?</i>

28:00.446 --> 28:02.246
Hey, Rick.

28:02.248 --> 28:05.149
Bunch of us are heading to
swan beach after school.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.717
You wanna come?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.353
Supposed to hang out with her.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.621
Rick: Then bring her.

28:23.936 --> 28:25.903
Your new sister
is kinda weird.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.674
Stop! Everyone's
staring at you.

28:30.676 --> 28:32.476
I'm sorry. We didn't have
birds on my planet.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.911
Don't say that stuff out loud.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.446
-(Car honking at a distance)
-(Woman screaming)

28:35.448 --> 28:37.681
-(Tires screeching)
-(Car crashes)

28:38.651 --> 28:40.217
What is wrong with you?

28:41.087 --> 28:42.152
Kara!

29:07.480 --> 29:08.746
Thank you.

29:11.884 --> 29:14.151
Kara! What are you doing?

29:15.387 --> 29:17.121
-Alex!
-(Car explodes)

29:25.164 --> 29:27.798
Alex had to get some stitches,
but she's gonna be okay.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.135
Listen... (Sighs)

29:32.671 --> 29:35.873
Doing what you can do
makes you special.

29:36.542 --> 29:37.875
But it's not safe.

29:38.677 --> 29:41.078
Those kids, their parents,

29:41.080 --> 29:44.348
they're all wondering
how a little girl

29:44.350 --> 29:45.949
pulled off that rescue today.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.385
We told them you got lucky,

29:48.387 --> 29:50.220
but that excuse
will work once.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.556
I'm sorry.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.091
I know you were only
trying to help.

29:54.093 --> 29:57.594
But the world already
has a superman.

29:57.596 --> 30:00.998
All you need to be
is Kara danvers.

30:04.737 --> 30:06.103
I made these for you.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.941
The frames are
lined with lead.

30:10.943 --> 30:12.176
They'll suppress your vision,

30:12.178 --> 30:13.610
help you fit in.

30:13.612 --> 30:14.878
They'll make your life

30:16.048 --> 30:17.114
easier.

30:25.724 --> 30:28.125
Pardon me. Sorry. Excuse me.

30:30.296 --> 30:31.361
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Ow.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.430
I'm really sorry,
i didn't mean it.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.799
Oops. (Chuckles) Sorry.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.769
Hey, hey. That's okay. Hi.

30:38.771 --> 30:41.538
I'm, my name's
winn schott. Junior.

30:41.540 --> 30:42.806
And who are you?

30:42.808 --> 30:44.508
-You are?
-Kara danvers.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.243
-(Knuckles crack)
-Oh! Wow.

30:46.245 --> 30:49.379
That's uh, quite a
firm handshake you
got going on there.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.848
Oh, yeah. (Chuckles)

30:50.850 --> 30:53.050
Well, I, I work out.

30:53.052 --> 30:55.285
-Yeah.
-I mean, um,

30:55.287 --> 30:57.187
I read in this
article somewhere

30:57.189 --> 30:59.022
that when you're going in
for a big interview

30:59.024 --> 31:03.060
you should start
with a firm shake.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.595
Yes.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.563
Um, interview? What job?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.365
Assistant to cat Grant.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.300
Oh.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.903
-Does her current assistant
know that she's, uh...
-(Woman crying)

31:14.473 --> 31:16.139
She knows.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.407
Cat: Okay, next.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.475
Oh, is that you?

31:19.311 --> 31:20.510
Cat: Where's my 10:15?

31:20.512 --> 31:23.413
I guess that's me. Any advice?

31:23.415 --> 31:25.182
Nah. Just be yourself.

31:25.818 --> 31:28.318
Right. Myself. Okay.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.257
Ms. Grant? Hi...

31:33.259 --> 31:34.458
Oh, for god's sake.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.561
I told them not to send
me any more millennials.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.829
I'm sorry?

31:38.831 --> 31:41.098
(Sighs) You are the
ultimate example

31:41.100 --> 31:42.933
of what is wrong with
parenting today.

31:42.935 --> 31:45.869
All that god-awful
self-esteem building,

31:45.871 --> 31:49.072
everyone is special,
everyone gets a trophy,

31:49.074 --> 31:50.340
and you all have opinions

31:50.342 --> 31:52.175
that you think
deserve to be heard.

31:52.177 --> 31:54.945
And yet the truth is you
need to earn the right

31:54.947 --> 31:57.414
to have an opinion
in the first place.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.516
So,

31:59.518 --> 32:03.420
my 10:15, tell me
why you're so special.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.488
I'm not...

32:05.324 --> 32:06.390
Special.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.624
I'm not special.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.459
There is absolutely
nothing special about me.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.796
I am totally, completely,
100% normal.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.698
Yes. You are.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.834
Absolutely. And I am
nothing if not average.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.803
Average strength,

32:19.805 --> 32:21.972
average hearing,

32:21.974 --> 32:24.474
less-than-average vision.
(Chuckles)

32:24.476 --> 32:28.245
There's... there is nothing
out of the ordinary about me.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.746
Okay, I get it.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.615
Except, except,

32:31.617 --> 32:34.117
that I am extremely committed.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.187
I care. I'm a hard worker.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.456
I just wanna help.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.258
Hmm, that's refreshing.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.261
I, I could, uh,

32:45.731 --> 32:48.565
I could make pharmacy
runs for you,

32:48.567 --> 32:50.133
pick up your prescriptions.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.335
It's funny that you
should say that.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.206
I think your pen's out of ink.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.841
No.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.849
I just wanna be useful.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.117
To somebody.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.020
I wanna be worthwhile.

33:10.022 --> 33:12.155
And you're not worthwhile?

33:12.157 --> 33:14.591
I haven't done
anything to prove it.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.262
Yet.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.264
I think you should
know that I expect

33:21.266 --> 33:24.001
complete and utter
devotion to this job.

33:24.003 --> 33:28.905
Are you willing to sacrifice
everything in your life
to be my assistant?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.173
Um...

33:32.177 --> 33:33.777
Yes.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.512
Yes, of course.

33:35.514 --> 33:40.951
When you are an alien, you're
willing to sacrifice anything,

33:40.953 --> 33:45.589
everything, betray
your fundamental instincts

33:46.692 --> 33:48.625
just to fit in.

33:48.627 --> 33:52.796
To belong somewhere, to find
your place in this world.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.765
If you have a
problem fitting in,

33:54.767 --> 33:57.634
it's because you lie to people
about who you really are.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.803
Lucy, are you really
willing to let Hank

33:59.805 --> 34:01.738
become a science experiment?

34:01.740 --> 34:04.341
And who knows what
they have planned for Alex.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.045
I know you're feeling
betrayed and alone,

34:09.081 --> 34:11.848
but if you go along
with Jim Harper

34:11.850 --> 34:13.250
just to feel like you fit in,

34:13.252 --> 34:15.585
to feel like you
belong somewhere,

34:15.587 --> 34:19.089
ultimately the only person
you're betraying is yourself.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.126
It wasn't easy for me to
show you who I really am,

34:23.128 --> 34:25.295
but I did it because
i trust who you are,

34:25.297 --> 34:28.432
who you really are,
under that uniform.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.568
And I trust you'll
do the right thing.

34:42.881 --> 34:46.016
When we get to cadmus,

34:46.018 --> 34:48.852
I'm gonna find out how you
overcome peoples' minds.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.587
How you steal their bodies.

34:51.523 --> 34:52.622
What makes you tick.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.658
You're gonna dissect me.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.127
Cadmus is not some area 51

34:57.129 --> 34:59.763
house of horrors, martian.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.465
It's a necessary place.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.366
A place where
we can unlock secrets

35:03.368 --> 35:04.868
to save American lives.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.771
Human lives.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.206
So, you're gonna dissect him.

35:11.009 --> 35:12.476
I'm protecting the world.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.911
You're pathetic.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.147
And you're a traitor.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.815
So get comfortable,
agent danvers,

35:18.817 --> 35:21.318
because you belong
to cadmus now.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.228
Sir, behind us.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.996
Sir, we've got two bogies.

35:32.998 --> 35:34.264
Harper: <i> Take 'em out.</i>

35:37.703 --> 35:39.202
(Tires screeching)

35:39.838 --> 35:41.571
(Grunting)

36:00.859 --> 36:02.492
They're wearing body armor.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.305
(Tires screeching)

36:30.956 --> 36:32.322
(Grunting)

36:47.272 --> 36:49.005
Do it, do it, martian.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.541
Be a monster. Prove me right.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.276
-Hank.
-It's all right.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.178
I've gotten better at this.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.914
I'm not gonna
kill you, colonel,

36:57.916 --> 37:00.317
I'm just gonna make you forget
what happened here tonight.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.458
(Distorted voices)

37:13.298 --> 37:16.032
-(Screams)
-(Gasping)

37:16.034 --> 37:17.667
J'onn.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.003
J'onn, are you okay?

37:22.007 --> 37:24.307
I, uh,

37:24.309 --> 37:26.576
I saw into Harper's mind.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.311
I saw him.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.479
Who?

37:29.481 --> 37:30.747
Jeremiah.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.184
I saw him

37:35.187 --> 37:37.020
at project cadmus.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.657
Alex, he's alive.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.126
Your dad's alive.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.966
For him to still be around
after all this time...

37:49.968 --> 37:51.167
Alex: I'm going
to get him back.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.936
Hank: We're gonna
get him back.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.237
Kara: I'm coming with you.

37:54.239 --> 37:56.172
I'm a fugitive now.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.074
I'm on the run.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.509
Let me take you to the
fortress of solitude

37:59.511 --> 38:02.812
where you'll be safe.
Let me find Jeremiah.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.081
Kara, I have to do this.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.653
Hey, have faith in me,

38:09.655 --> 38:11.221
like I have in you.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.724
What am I gonna
do without you?

38:14.726 --> 38:16.559
You don't need me.

38:16.561 --> 38:17.627
You never have.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.596
No. Well, you still
took care of me anyway.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.531
Yeah, look how great
you turned out.

38:23.235 --> 38:25.302
-I love you.
-I love you too.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.445
-Don't worry. She'll be okay.
-I know.

38:35.447 --> 38:36.313
She has you.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.647
We both have you.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.618
(Motorcycle revving)

38:59.838 --> 39:01.304
Cat: Siobhan. Come in.

39:04.142 --> 39:05.575
Make yourself comfortable.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.644
I'd offer you a cappuccino,
but as you can see

39:07.646 --> 39:09.779
we're a bit short-staffed
at the moment.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.147
What happened to Kara?

39:11.149 --> 39:13.683
Mm, funny you should ask.

39:13.685 --> 39:16.252
I very rarely have
to say this, Siobhan,

39:16.254 --> 39:20.156
but I think I made
a terrible mistake.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.125
-Oh?
-Uh-huh.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.060
Kara has been a
tremendous assistant,

39:24.062 --> 39:27.030
as I'm sure you observed
during your brief time here.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.833
Who could have ever
thought that underneath
that prim little

39:29.835 --> 39:32.736
sweater-set was a
simmering cauldron of rage

39:32.738 --> 39:35.105
just waiting to boil over?

39:36.274 --> 39:38.108
I don't understand.

39:38.110 --> 39:39.976
She sent me an email.

39:39.978 --> 39:44.247
Telling me what she thinks
of me in terms that are,

39:44.249 --> 39:47.283
well, highly
unsuitable to repeat

39:47.285 --> 39:49.419
in a professional setting.

39:49.421 --> 39:53.723
Called me names that I haven't
heard since the last mediation
with my ex-husband.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.425
That is so surprising.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.127
Yes, I thought so too.

39:57.129 --> 40:00.530
Which is why I found
someone who did an
obsessive study

40:00.532 --> 40:02.432
of Kara for the
past two years.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.003
Winn?

40:07.005 --> 40:08.171
I analyzed the typing speed

40:08.173 --> 40:10.340
and patterns
on the hard drive.

40:10.342 --> 40:12.709
It didn't match Kara's,
but it did match yours.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.577
I don't have very
many regrets, Siobhan,

40:14.579 --> 40:18.381
but I do regret
firing you the first time.

40:18.383 --> 40:22.352
I wish to god that I could
fire you again with feeling.

40:22.354 --> 40:23.820
Ms. Grant, I can explain...

40:23.822 --> 40:24.954
No...

40:24.956 --> 40:27.624
Save it for the police.

40:27.626 --> 40:30.126
Because that's who you'll be
talking to if you ever pull

40:30.128 --> 40:33.496
something like that again.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.765
Now, get out of my office
and never come back.

40:46.478 --> 40:48.011
Do you think they
know it was us?

40:48.013 --> 40:49.546
We'll see.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.382
Man: Atten-hut!

40:53.985 --> 40:55.051
At ease.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.920
Ma'am, we've had a...

40:56.922 --> 40:58.388
Security breach, I know.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.557
What are we doing to
re-apprehend the detainees?

41:00.559 --> 41:03.359
-Ma'am?
-What are colonel
Harper's orders?

41:03.361 --> 41:05.028
Ma'am, colonel Harper
just resigned

41:05.030 --> 41:07.864
and named a new
acting director of the deo.

41:07.866 --> 41:09.399
-Who?
-You.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.370
Are you sure?

41:14.372 --> 41:16.339
Yes. He was quite adamant
about your appointment.

41:18.543 --> 41:21.711
I guess j'onn's gotten good at
that whole mind control thing.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.813
You're gonna help
me do this, right?

41:23.815 --> 41:25.148
Yeah, of course.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.916
But you're gonna be great.
This is where you belong.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.486
Ma'am, there's a bank robbery
at 10th and shukert.

41:29.488 --> 41:31.554
No alien involvement,
but I just thought

41:31.556 --> 41:32.822
you might wanna know.

41:34.493 --> 41:36.192
And you belong out there.

41:36.194 --> 41:39.062
After what I did,
the people don't
trust me anymore.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.731
You got me to trust you.

41:41.733 --> 41:42.799
That's a start.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.870
(Sighs deeply)

42:01.052 --> 42:02.418
And I hate you, too.

42:02.420 --> 42:04.654
Siobhan, no, no, no!
Stop. Stop.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.424
Seriously?

42:08.426 --> 42:10.026
I have too much self-esteem
to kill myself.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.861
Killing someone else,
on the other hand...

42:11.863 --> 42:14.330
Oh, I'm sorry. What did
you expect me to do?

42:14.332 --> 42:15.632
I don't know.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.400
Not rat me out to
freaking cat Grant.

42:17.402 --> 42:19.369
You lied, Siobhan, okay?

42:19.371 --> 42:21.337
And you committed mail fraud
or email fraud,

42:21.339 --> 42:24.407
which is potentially,
like, a federal crime.

42:24.409 --> 42:26.109
You were supposed
to be on my side.

42:26.111 --> 42:27.744
I was! I am.

42:27.746 --> 42:30.747
Except, you know,
Kara is my best friend.

42:30.749 --> 42:33.149
And you know what?
No, I did this for you too.

42:33.151 --> 42:36.085
Because if this woulda worked,
you would have regretted it.

42:36.087 --> 42:39.255
And I know that deep down
you are a good person.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.190
You don't know me.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.359
You don't know anything.

42:43.361 --> 42:46.195
You said that I could
have whatever I wanted

42:46.197 --> 42:48.865
and I have nothing.

42:48.867 --> 42:51.234
No job, no friends...

42:51.236 --> 42:53.102
I just want to scream...

42:53.104 --> 42:54.270
(Gasps)

42:54.272 --> 42:55.705
-(Screaming)
-(Mouthing) Oh, god, no!

42:55.707 --> 42:57.540
-(Screaming)
-No!

43:37.949 --> 43:39.415
Greg! Move your head!
