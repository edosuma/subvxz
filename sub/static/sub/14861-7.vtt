WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:02.103
YOU READY?

00:02.103 --> 00:03.674
YOU SHOOT THAT THING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

00:03.674 --> 00:05.036
(creaks)

00:05.036 --> 00:07.478
HEY, GUYS, LISTEN UP.

00:07.478 --> 00:10.311
WHAT'S GOING ON, BUDDY?

00:10.311 --> 00:11.612
YOU DO KNOW THAT ARROW

00:11.612 --> 00:14.345
WILL GO RIGHT THROUGH
THAT CHAIN MAIL, DON'T YOU?

00:14.345 --> 00:17.118
UH, I DON'T THINK SO.
I MADE THIS OUT OF KEY CHAINS.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.190
FINE. DIE.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.422
SO NATHAN JUST QUIT
SCIENCE CLUB.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.753
EVERY TIME HE HAD TO GO,

00:22.753 --> 00:24.355
HE CONVENIENTLY GOT
A STOMACHACHE,

00:24.355 --> 00:27.158
AND HE DID THE SAME THING
WITH PIANO LESSONS.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.500
I'M GLAD HE QUIT PIANO.
HE WAS BUTCHERING THAT THING.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.463
I'M JUST WORRIED
THAT HE'S NOT DISCIPLINED.

00:32.463 --> 00:34.805
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD FORCE HIM
TO STICK WITH THINGS.

00:34.805 --> 00:37.168
LIKE, MY FATHER NEVER
LET ME QUIT ANYTHING,

00:37.168 --> 00:38.639
EVEN THAT JOB
AT THE DRIVING RANGE

00:38.639 --> 00:41.112
WHERE I HAD TO WEAR THAT T-SHIRT
THAT SAID "BALL WASHER."

00:41.112 --> 00:42.143
(laughs)

00:42.143 --> 00:43.314
WATCH THIS, WILL.

00:44.745 --> 00:45.746
(creaks)

00:45.746 --> 00:47.418
(pop, thud)

00:47.418 --> 00:49.580
WHOA.

00:49.580 --> 00:52.353
WILL WAS RIGHT.
THAT WOULD'VE KILLED YOU.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.324
I DISAGREE.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.193
WELL, GUESS WHAT DR. COLE SAID
ABOUT NATHAN'S STOMACHACHE.

01:02.193 --> 01:03.694
(mouth full)
HE'S FAKING IT, ISN'T HE?

01:03.694 --> 01:05.065
HE'S ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.199
HE'S ALLERGIC TO GLUTEN,
ISN'T HE? SEE? GLUTEN.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.671
FROM NOW ON, HE CAN'T EAT
ANYTHING THAT HAS IT.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.203
NO. THAT'S GONNA BE TOO HARD.

01:12.203 --> 01:14.805
NATHAN, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BE DISCIPLINED

01:14.805 --> 01:16.577
AND TO PROVE TO YOURSELF
THAT YOU CAN DO

01:16.577 --> 01:18.849
ANYTHING
YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO.

01:18.849 --> 01:20.711
GREAT. I'M A NERD
WITH A FOOD ALLERGY.

01:20.711 --> 01:23.614
LINE UP, LADIES.

01:23.614 --> 01:26.657
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE GONNA LEAD BY EXAMPLE.

01:26.657 --> 01:28.759
THIS WHOLE FAMILY IS
GOING OFF GLUTEN.

01:28.759 --> 01:30.761
(laughs) YOU DO REALIZE

01:30.761 --> 01:32.863
THAT YOU'RE PART
OF THIS FAMILY, DON'T YOU?

01:32.863 --> 01:34.094
(chuckles)
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.496
YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE
THE DISCIPLINE TO DO IT?

01:35.496 --> 01:38.129
NO, I'M--YES, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:38.129 --> 01:39.370
I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF DISCIPLINE.

01:39.370 --> 01:41.402
MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY DISCIPLINE.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.175
OH, PLEASE. I TAUGHT MYSELF
FRENCH WHEN I WAS 9

01:44.175 --> 01:45.576
AND TRAINED FOR A MARATHON
IN A WEEK.

01:45.576 --> 01:46.877
YOU COULDN'T GO OFF
DIET SODA FOR A DAY

01:46.877 --> 01:49.610
BECAUSE YOU BECAME--
YOUR WORDS--"TOO WEEPY."

01:49.610 --> 01:51.282
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME
SO WELL.

01:51.282 --> 01:53.284
I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT IF THIS IS A COMPETITION,

01:53.284 --> 01:56.187
WHICH IT NOW IS, I'LL WIN.

01:56.187 --> 01:57.788
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET
IN MY HEAD.

01:57.788 --> 01:59.190
I'M LIVING IN YOUR HEAD.

01:59.190 --> 02:01.121
(chuckles) OH, YEAH?
WELL, LOOK AROUND,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.823
BECAUSE THE LOBE
THAT CONTROLS DISCIPLINE

02:02.823 --> 02:04.595
IS PLANNING
MY VICTORY PARTY.

02:04.595 --> 02:06.857
OH. (clicks tongue)
WHAT'S THAT, LOBE?

02:06.857 --> 02:09.460
OH, THERESA'S NOT INVITED?
OH, HOW SAD.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.662
OHH. WELL, YOUR LOBE
CAN SUCK IT.

02:11.662 --> 02:13.834
AND BY THE WAY, DO YOU EVEN
KNOW WHAT GLUTEN IS?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.206
NO, I DO NOT.

02:16.807 --> 02:19.139
GLUTEN,
FROM THE LATIN "GLUTEN."

02:19.139 --> 02:20.611
IT'S A PROTEIN FOUND
IN WHEAT, BARLEY, AND RYE.

02:20.611 --> 02:21.842
IT'S WHY DOUGH HAS ELASTICITY,

02:21.842 --> 02:23.874
AND IT GIVES FOOD
A DELIGHTFUL, CHEWY TEXTURE.

02:23.874 --> 02:27.218
NOW HERE'S THE BAD NEWS.
IT'S KILLING ALL OF AMERICA.

02:27.218 --> 02:28.219
(bag rustles)

02:28.219 --> 02:29.650
(scoffs)
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.151
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.754
UH, GRANT'S JUST VERY PASSIONATE
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.786
HE'S EVEN GOTTEN ME
INTO IT.

02:35.786 --> 02:38.229
NOW MY SKIN'S CLEARER.
I'VE GOT MORE ENERGY.

02:38.229 --> 02:39.860
MY BOOBS ARE BIGGER.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.193
OKAY, THEY'RE NOT BIGGER,
BUT THEY DO HAVE MORE PIZZAZZ.

02:42.193 --> 02:44.164
(chuckles)

02:44.164 --> 02:46.867
UH, IT'S IN PRETZELS?
REALLY? AND CHEESE PUFFS?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.469
I THOUGHT THOSE WERE
ALL NATURAL.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.870
SO ARE COBRAS, WILL.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.343
IT'S IN EVERYTHING GOOD, HONEY.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

02:52.343 --> 02:53.504
YOU AND YOUR LOBE HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

02:53.504 --> 02:54.675
ABOUT THROWING
THAT VICTORY PARTY?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.207
NEED TO MAKE A PHONE CALL,

02:56.207 --> 02:57.548
CANCEL THE DEEJAY
AND THE BRAIN STRIPPERS?

02:57.548 --> 02:58.809
NOT AT ALL.
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE

02:58.809 --> 03:01.412
HOME ALONE WITH THE SAD LOBE
AND NO BRAIN STRIPPERS.

03:01.412 --> 03:02.653
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

03:02.653 --> 03:04.215
(lowered voice)
OH, WHEN THEY GET COMPETITIVE,

03:04.215 --> 03:06.687
THIS IS HOW THEY TRASH-TALK.
IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO FOLLOW.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.260
HUH.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.592
SO PRETTY MUCH
ALL WE CAN EAT ARE...

03:11.592 --> 03:12.823
LIGHTBULBS?

03:12.823 --> 03:15.195
GLUTEN? ISN'T THAT
THE STUFF IN LIGHTBULBS?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.668
NAH. I THINK GLUTEN IS
THE NAME OF AQUAMAN'S NEMESIS.

03:17.668 --> 03:19.230
YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME.
WHENEVER YOU DON'T KNOW A WORD,

03:19.230 --> 03:21.272
YOU THINK
IT'S A SUPERHERO'S NEMESIS,

03:21.272 --> 03:22.573
LIKE "PONTIFICATE."

03:22.573 --> 03:25.276
HE AND OSTRACIZE BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF GREEN LANTERN.

03:25.276 --> 03:28.309
WRONG. WILL, WOULD YOU
PLEASE--WILL!

03:28.309 --> 03:29.740
(gasps)
SOME PEOPLE CAN BECOME LETHARGIC

03:29.740 --> 03:32.413
WHEN THEY GO OFF GLUTEN,
BUT NOT ME. I'M FINE.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.844
JUST DEALING
WITH A LITTLE HUNGER ISSUE.

03:33.844 --> 03:37.918
LIKE, I HAVE A HUNGER. LIKE,
AN INTENSE, ANGRY... HUNGER.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.520
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, WILL?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.921
TO TEACH NATHAN DISCIPLINE,

03:40.921 --> 03:43.424
AND BECAUSE THERESA THINKS
SHE CAN DO IT AND I CAN'T.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.656
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD SHOW
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE

03:45.656 --> 03:47.498
WITH
THAT BIG BURGER SITUATION.

03:47.498 --> 03:50.401
WE LIKE THESE TWO GIRLS
WHO WORK AT THE DRIVE-THRU.

03:50.401 --> 03:52.333
WE CALL THEM
MONEY AND FOOD.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.305
MY GIRL IS MONEY,
BECAUSE SHE TAKES THE MONEY.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.367
I LIKE FOOD.
SHE GIVE ME MY FOOD.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.368
WE'VE BEEN GOING TO LUNCH
THERE EVERY DAY

03:57.368 --> 03:58.939
TO TRY AND WIN THEM OVER,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.771
PERHAPS WE SHOULD SHOW
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE

04:00.771 --> 04:02.573
AND GO MORE OFTEN.

04:02.573 --> 04:03.574
MM-HMM.

04:03.574 --> 04:04.775
THAT'S NOT DISCIPLINE.

04:04.775 --> 04:05.976
THAT'S GOING TO BIG BURGER
TO HIT ON WOMEN.

04:05.976 --> 04:07.948
THAT'S DISCIPLINE--
DOING WHAT YOU WANT

04:07.948 --> 04:10.751
BUT DOING IT ALL THE TIME.
LOOK IT UP.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.623
DON'T NEED TO,
'CAUSE IT'S NOT THAT.

04:12.623 --> 04:14.425
WELL, WORDS CAN MEAN DIFFERENT
THINGS TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

04:14.425 --> 04:15.626
ALSO NOT TRUE.

04:15.626 --> 04:17.288
DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN
BY "TRUE."

04:17.288 --> 04:18.329
(chuckles) OH!

04:18.329 --> 04:20.331
CHEW ON THAT WHILE WE EXERCISE
SOME DISCIPLINE

04:20.331 --> 04:22.633
AND GO TO LUNCH,
WHATEVER "LUNCH" MEANS.

04:22.633 --> 04:23.634
(chuckles)

04:23.634 --> 04:24.635
(high-pitched voice) WHAT?

04:24.635 --> 04:27.868
(imitating explosions)

04:28.969 --> 04:32.743
OHH! AHH.

04:32.743 --> 04:35.275
HE JUST BLEW YOUR MIND, WILLIAM.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.453
(gasps)
IMAGINE MEETING YOU HERE.

04:42.453 --> 04:44.485
(giggles) HI, CRAIG.

04:44.485 --> 04:48.288
I LAUGH AT THAT JOKE EVERY TIME.
I'M SO EASY. (chuckles)

04:48.288 --> 04:49.320
ARE YOU?

04:49.320 --> 04:51.291
(giggles) THAT ONE, TOO.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.424
(mouths word)

04:53.424 --> 04:55.025
HERE IS YOUR CHANGE.
(coins clink)

04:55.025 --> 04:57.368
I DON'T NEED TO COUNT IT.
I TRUST YOU.

04:57.368 --> 04:59.029
MM, BUT CAN I TRUST YOU?

04:59.029 --> 05:00.931
NO. (chuckles)

05:00.931 --> 05:04.034
I MEAN, YES, YOU CAN.
I'M--I'M VERY TRUSTWORTHY.

05:04.034 --> 05:05.836
GOOD--GOOD-BYE.

05:05.836 --> 05:07.307
(giggles) BYE.

05:11.412 --> 05:14.845
(both grunting)

05:14.845 --> 05:16.717
(sighs) I SCREWED UP
THAT LAST PART,

05:16.717 --> 05:18.349
BUT IT WAS GOOD.
NO, YOU WERE GREAT.

05:18.349 --> 05:20.020
OKAY. GOOD. THANKS.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.394
HEY, GORGEOUS.

05:23.394 --> 05:24.855
YOU GOT SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR ME?

05:24.855 --> 05:27.898
HI, KENNY. I SLIPPED
A FUDGY FINGER IN THERE.

05:27.898 --> 05:30.761
A WHAT, MADAME?

05:30.761 --> 05:32.062
IT'S A FRIED BROWNIE.

05:32.062 --> 05:33.404
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
ON THE MENU TILL NEXT WEEK,

05:33.404 --> 05:35.366
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT LIKE A PREVIEW.

05:35.366 --> 05:38.038
OH. THEN I ACCEPT
YOUR FUDGY FINGER,

05:38.038 --> 05:39.970
AND I THANK YOU FOR THE TREAT.

05:39.970 --> 05:41.872
(giggles)
ADIEU.

05:41.872 --> 05:43.374
(both, high-pitched voices)
BOOP.

05:48.419 --> 05:50.881
THAT WAS AWESOME.
WILL, HERE'S YOUR SALAD.

05:50.881 --> 05:53.624
WHAT? OHH. WAIT.
HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP?

05:53.624 --> 05:56.356
OH, NO. WILL'S GONE, BUT LOOK,
IT'S SNIDELY WHIPLASH.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.528
(laughing)

05:57.528 --> 05:58.929
OH, YOU GUYS! I--

05:58.929 --> 06:01.492
(slaps leg)
I'M SUPPOSED TO GET
A NEW I.D. BADGE TODAY.

06:01.492 --> 06:03.363
I CAN'T HAVE ONE OF THESE ON
TWO YEARS IN A ROW.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.565
(laughing)
(snorts)

06:04.565 --> 06:05.996
OH, MY GOD.
THAT FOOD SMELLS AMAZING.

06:05.996 --> 06:07.367
HAVE SOME.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.539
OHH.
WE'RE GOING THROUGH
THE DRIVE-THRU, LIKE,

06:08.539 --> 06:10.441
FOUR MORE TIMES.
YEAH, DO SOME MORE FLIRTING,

06:10.441 --> 06:12.002
AND BY THE END OF THE DAY,
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH BURGERS

06:12.002 --> 06:13.444
TO MAKE ABIZZA.

06:13.444 --> 06:14.845
WHAT'S A BIZZA?
IT'S A BURGER PIZZA.

06:14.845 --> 06:16.477
TAKE A BUNCH OF BURGERS,
SMASH 'EM DOWN IN A PIZZA PAN,

06:16.477 --> 06:19.009
COVER THE ENTIRE THING
IN CHEESE AND TOMATO SAUCE.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.011
IT'S OUR CULINARY CONTRIBUTION
TO HUMANITY.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.112
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE BEST THING EVER.

06:22.112 --> 06:23.814
I WANT TO BE BURIED IN ONE
WHEN I DIE.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.817
YOU MEAN A CHEESEBUR-CASKET?
WAY AHEAD OF YOU, BUDDY.

06:26.817 --> 06:29.590
OH, STATE WON'T
ALLOW IT.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.091
THIS GLUTEN-FREE THING
IS REALLY WORKING OUT.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.863
NATHAN'S STOMACHACHES
ARE GONE.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.765
IT IS SO NICE NOT HAVING
A TEACHER KNOCKING

06:34.765 --> 06:37.428
ON THE BATHROOM STALL,
ASKING IF I'M OKAY.

06:37.428 --> 06:38.429
OHH.

06:38.429 --> 06:39.830
AND IT'S BEEN EASY
TO STICK TO,

06:39.830 --> 06:42.503
ESPECIALLY SINCE I DON'T HAVE
MY OWN MONEY TO BUY FOOD

06:42.503 --> 06:44.675
OR ANY WAY TO GET
TO A STORE.

06:44.675 --> 06:47.177
SO HOW'S IT GOING
FOR YOU,HONEY?

06:47.177 --> 06:49.179
WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. (chuckles)

06:49.179 --> 06:50.881
WE'RE ON A DIET.

06:50.881 --> 06:53.584
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SO SIMPLE
THAT I FORGOT ABOUT IT.

06:53.584 --> 06:55.185
SO WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

06:55.185 --> 06:57.087
PIZZA.
SERIOUSLY?

06:57.087 --> 06:58.418
YEP. GLUTEN-FREE.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.419
(splats)

06:59.419 --> 07:00.951
JUST LIKE REGULAR PIZZA,

07:00.951 --> 07:02.723
EXCEPT YOU EAT IT
WITH A SPOON.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.526
(doorbell rings)

07:07.427 --> 07:08.959
I NEED BIZZA.

07:10.561 --> 07:13.864
MMM. OHH.

07:13.864 --> 07:15.706
MMM.

07:19.570 --> 07:20.711
I FEEL AWFUL.

07:20.711 --> 07:22.673
SURE. YOU JUST HAD FIVE SLICES
OF BIZZA IN THREE MINUTES.

07:22.673 --> 07:24.615
YOUR STOMACH'S PUTTING UP
A FIGHT IT CANNOT WIN.

07:24.615 --> 07:26.477
NO, I MEAN, I CHEATED
ON THE DIET,

07:26.477 --> 07:28.519
JUST LIKE THERESA SAID
I WOULD.

07:28.519 --> 07:30.180
I AM SO WEAK.

07:30.180 --> 07:33.153
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
MY BLOOD SUGAR IS RAGING.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.825
(chuckles) I'M SO STRONG.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.528
I COULD RACE A LEOPARD...
OR A PUMA!

07:37.528 --> 07:38.959
JUST ENJOY THE RIDE, BUDDY,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.160
AND MAYBE TAKE A BREAK
FROM TELLING US

07:40.160 --> 07:42.533
ALL THE DIFFERENT ANIMALS
YOU COULD RACE.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.165
(chuckles) SO WE FOUND OUT
SOMETHING TODAY.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.597
OSTRICH.

07:46.597 --> 07:49.500
RIGHT. SO... MONEY AND FOOD,
THE DRIVE-THRU GIRLS--

07:49.500 --> 07:50.941
WE FOUND OUT...
THEY'RE SISTERS!

07:50.941 --> 07:53.504
YEAH, AND EACH OF US
IS WITH ONE OF THEM.

07:53.504 --> 07:55.475
HOW HOT ISTHAT?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.208
NOT HOT AT ALL.
I MEAN, SISTERS ARE HOT,

07:58.208 --> 08:00.080
BUT YOU HAVE TO BOTH BE
WITH BOTH OF THEM.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.111
WE ARE.

08:01.111 --> 08:02.853
AT THE SAME TIME.
WE ARE.

08:02.853 --> 08:06.817
I MEAN, EACH OF YOU WITH BOTH
OF THEM AT THE SAME TIME.

08:06.817 --> 08:08.759
THAT IS GROSS, WILL.
THEY'RE SISTERS.

08:08.759 --> 08:10.521
YEAH,
HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT.

08:10.521 --> 08:11.862
I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO GET BACK ON TRACK.

08:11.862 --> 08:12.963
I NEED TO BE AROUND PEOPLE

08:12.963 --> 08:15.125
WHO BELIEVE THAT
I CAN STICK TO THIS DIET,

08:15.125 --> 08:17.698
BECAUSE I AMNOT
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.772
(door closes)

08:21.772 --> 08:23.634
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD
BE HOTTER?

08:23.634 --> 08:27.237
IF WE WERE BROTHERS
AND WE HAD SEX WITH ONE OF THEM.

08:27.237 --> 08:30.510
(chuckles) YEAH. WAIT. NO.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.612
WHY DON'T WE GET THIS?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.083
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH US.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.245
I KNOW IT'S REALLY HARD
TO EAT THIS WAY...

08:35.245 --> 08:37.517
(sighs) MM.
BUT IT IS SO WORTH IT.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.849
YOU WERE SMART TO COME
TO US FOR HELP, WILL.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.191
I'M GONNA ENTICE YOUR TASTE BUDS
WITH BANANA PASTE

08:41.191 --> 08:44.154
ON A MILLET STONE CRISP
SO GOOD...

08:44.154 --> 08:46.627
(chuckles)
IT'LL UNNERVE YOU.

08:46.627 --> 08:50.661
OOH. LOOK WHAT
WE'RE GONNA GET.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.303
(sighs)
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT,

08:53.303 --> 08:54.665
THERE'S A BIG PILE OF IT
FROM THE LAST TIME...

08:54.665 --> 08:56.536
(lowered voice)
THAT I DUMPED IN THAT PLANT.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.068
WHAT?

08:58.068 --> 09:00.240
YOU CAME HERE FOR HELP.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.912
(plastic rustling)
HERE IT IS.

09:01.912 --> 09:05.616
THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE THIS
DIET IS TO NEVER ACTUALLY DO IT.

09:05.616 --> 09:07.077
(singsongy) PECAN TURTLE?

09:07.077 --> 09:08.719
YOU MEAN YOU'RE CHEATING?

09:08.719 --> 09:11.551
(mouth full) PFFT. OF COURSE.
ONLY FREAKS

09:11.551 --> 09:12.783
LIKE GRANT AND THERESA
CAN SURVIVE THIS DIET.

09:12.783 --> 09:13.924
(gasps)

09:13.924 --> 09:16.827
MORTALS LIKE US
HAVE TO CHEAT.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.760
YOU WANNA KNOW
HOW YOU WIN, WILL?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.191
(rattles)

09:21.191 --> 09:24.695
(singsongy) BY NEVER LETTING
THERESA KNOW THAT SHE WON.

09:24.695 --> 09:25.596
OHH!

09:25.596 --> 09:28.568
SO YOU JUST HIDE SNACKS
AROUND THE HOUSE?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.670
EVERYWHERE.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.941
THAT COUCH ALONE HAS
SO MUCH PIE UNDER IT,

09:30.941 --> 09:32.803
IT'S LIKE A COUNTY FAIR
DOWN THERE.

09:32.803 --> 09:35.175
(crunches) CHIP?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.679
SEE, THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT CHICKEN TENDERS--

09:38.679 --> 09:41.251
YOU CAN GO AROUND AGAIN AND SAY
YOU FORGOT DIPPING SAUCE.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.913
I THINK I'M GONNA GET INTO
SOME DEEPER STUFF THIS TIME--

09:42.913 --> 09:45.756
RELIGION, WAR ON TERROR,
ABOR--

09:45.756 --> 09:47.217
(giggling) JOEL, STOP.

09:47.217 --> 09:48.619
HEY.
(Money) YOU'RE SO BAD.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.661
WHAT IS MONEY DOING
LAUGHING WITH THAT GUY?

09:50.661 --> 09:52.062
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES
WITHME!

09:52.062 --> 09:54.094
SHE'S JUST BEING POLITE
TO THE CUSTOMERS. KEEP IT COOL.

09:55.766 --> 09:56.927
OHH.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.171
HI.

10:01.171 --> 10:02.372
YEAH.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.274
WHO ARE THE GUYS IN THE FIERO,
THE COMEDIANS?

10:04.274 --> 10:06.777
OH, IT'S BRIAN AND JOEL.
THEY COME HERE ALL THE TIME.

10:06.777 --> 10:07.878
OH.
THEY'RE ALWAYS JOKING ABOUT

10:07.878 --> 10:09.609
RESCUING ME AND MY SISTER
FROM OUR WINDOWS

10:09.609 --> 10:11.642
AND DRIVING OFF
INTO THE SUNSET.

10:11.642 --> 10:14.384
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
A PREVIEW. IT'S A FUDGY FINGER.

10:14.384 --> 10:15.786
WHAT?!

10:15.786 --> 10:16.987
(giggles)

10:16.987 --> 10:19.820
MY BEAUTIFUL FOOD HAS
BETRAYED ME.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.151
(chuckles) HO HO!

10:21.151 --> 10:22.322
HEY. GOOD NEWS.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.724
THIS DISCIPLINE THING
REALLY PAID OFF.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.195
NATHAN REJOINED
SCIENCE CLUB.

10:25.195 --> 10:26.626
REALLY? THAT'S GREAT.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.660
OH,ISEE.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.803
YOU WANT TO QUIT THE DIET?
IS THAT IT?

10:32.803 --> 10:35.836
I'M NOT QUITTING ANYTHING,
BUT YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.207
I'M NOT QUITTING.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.269
GOOD, BECAUSE THERE'S,
LIKE, 6 POUNDS OF SOY-SAGNA

10:39.269 --> 10:40.640
IN THE FRIDGE.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.813
MMM. NOT FOR LONG.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.082
OHH.

10:53.684 --> 10:56.186
I WANT YOU INSIDE ME.

10:56.186 --> 10:57.888
(sighs) DARN IT.

10:57.888 --> 10:59.229
FORGOT MY KEYS.
(thuds)

10:59.229 --> 11:02.132
(chuckles) WELL, THEN HOW ARE
YOU GONNA DRIVE AWAY?

11:08.739 --> 11:10.270
(mouths word)

11:11.301 --> 11:12.703
WHO DRIVES A FIERO ANYWAY?

11:12.703 --> 11:14.845
MYMOM,AFTER SHE RETIRED,

11:14.845 --> 11:16.777
TO PROVE TO MY DAD
THAT SHE'S STILL GOT IT.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.208
AND SHEDID NOTSTILL
HAVE IT.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.010
PFFT. NOT EVEN CLOSE.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOTTA DO?

11:20.010 --> 11:21.681
WE GOTTA MAKE
FOOD AND MONEY JEALOUS,

11:21.681 --> 11:24.414
LIKE THEY'RE DOING TO US.
SHOW THEM WE HAVE OPTIONS, TOO.

11:24.414 --> 11:25.685
YOU MEAN LIKE OTHER GIRLS?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.858
YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE
THOSE KIND OF OPTIONS,

11:27.858 --> 11:30.791
BUT WE DO HAVE SOMETHING
EVEN BETTER.

11:30.791 --> 11:31.822
WHAT?

11:31.822 --> 11:32.723
I THOUGHT YOU'D HAVE
SOME THOUGHTS.

11:32.723 --> 11:34.925
(sneezes)

11:34.925 --> 11:36.797
(strained voice) HI, GUYS.
(sneezes and grunts)

11:36.797 --> 11:38.268
BLESS YOU, FRIEND.

11:38.268 --> 11:39.399
THANK YOU. (sneezes)

11:39.399 --> 11:40.700
THAT'LL DO.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.732
(sneezes)

11:41.732 --> 11:43.874
(haughty voice)
I SAID, "THAT'LL DO," SIR.

11:43.874 --> 11:45.005
SORRY. (sniffles)

11:45.005 --> 11:46.106
I'VE BEEN SPENDING
A LITTLE TIME UNDER THE HOUSE.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.137
DIGGING FOR GOLD?

11:47.137 --> 11:48.438
DID YOU MURDER A NEIGHBOR?

11:48.438 --> 11:51.081
NO, NOTHING WEIRD.
I'M JUST EATING UNDER THERE.

11:51.081 --> 11:53.113
THERESA ALMOST CAUGHT ME
CHEATING ON THIS DIET

11:53.113 --> 11:55.946
A COUPLE TIMES, SO I SET UP
THIS REALLY COOL MAN CAVE

11:55.946 --> 11:59.750
WHERE I CAN CHILL OUT AND EAT
CRAP THE WAY GOD INTENDED.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.752
OOH! A MAN CAVE.
I WANT TO BE THERE NOW.

12:01.752 --> 12:03.323
WHY ARE WE STILL NOT THERE?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.925
WHY ARE WE STILL HERE?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.257
(whispers)
THIS PLACE ISHORRIBLE.

12:07.257 --> 12:09.800
WELL, I KNOW IT'S NOT FULLY
TRICKED-OUT YET,

12:09.800 --> 12:11.501
BUT IMAGINE IT
WITH A CEREAL DISPENSER

12:11.501 --> 12:12.763
AND A MINI FRIDGE.

12:12.763 --> 12:13.934
EVENTUALLY
I'LL DIG A FEW PITS...
(thud)

12:13.934 --> 12:15.265
SO WE CAN STAND UPRIGHT.
OH.

12:15.265 --> 12:18.208
(inhales deeply)
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.170
SOMETHIN' BIG'S BEEN PEEING
DOWN HERE.

12:20.170 --> 12:21.912
YEAH, THERE WAS A POSSUM.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.743
I THINK THAT PEE IS
FROM WHATEVER KILLED IT.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.816
ANYWAY, IT'S GONNA
BE GREAT, RIGHT?

12:25.816 --> 12:27.247
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN PICTURE IT.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.420
NICE RUG ON THE FLOOR,
A COUPLE THROW PILLOWS,

12:30.420 --> 12:32.322
MAYBE A MOROCCAN VIBE.

12:34.825 --> 12:36.456
WHAT?

12:37.928 --> 12:39.790
(Craig) AAH!

12:39.790 --> 12:42.762
OH, MY GOD. THAT SPIDER BIT ME
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.835
(panting)
I AM SO, SO SORRY.

12:44.835 --> 12:46.296
I CAN'T FEEL THE LEFT SIDE
OF MY BODY.

12:46.296 --> 12:47.798
HOW COULD YOU INVITE PEOPLE
DOWN THERE?

12:47.798 --> 12:49.469
IT'S JUST PLAIN RECKLESS!

12:49.469 --> 12:51.371
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT!

12:51.371 --> 12:53.944
DON'T BOTHER DIGGING
ME AND CRAIG STANDING PITS.

12:53.944 --> 12:55.345
WE'RE NOT GOING
BACK THERE AGAIN.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.908
AAH! I FEEL ANOTHER ONE ON ME.
KILL IT. KILL IT!

12:57.908 --> 12:59.950
NO, NO.
WE GOT 'EM ALL, BUDDY.

12:59.950 --> 13:01.812
NICE WORK, WILL.
YOU BROKE CRAIG.

13:01.812 --> 13:03.313
(sighs) WHAT AM I DOING?

13:03.313 --> 13:06.456
I-I'VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD
TO WIN THIS THING WITH THERESA

13:06.456 --> 13:08.819
THAT I'VE TOTALLY LOST
PERSPECTIVE.

13:08.819 --> 13:10.961
LAST NIGHT, I PEED
IN AN EMPTY POTATO CHIP BAG.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.422
(high-pitched voice) OH!
I'M DONE.

13:12.422 --> 13:15.025
KENNY, IT'S GETTING COLD.

13:15.025 --> 13:17.828
DON'T YOU DIE ONME!

13:17.828 --> 13:19.429
WHAT? BUT, WILL...

13:19.429 --> 13:21.331
(rustles)
YOU HAVEIT ALL.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.974
I MEAN, WHY STOP NOW,
WHEN YOU'RE A WINNER?

13:23.974 --> 13:25.836
I CAN'T KEEP LYING
TO THERESA.

13:25.836 --> 13:28.909
I DON'T CARE IF SHE GLOATS ABOUT
HOW SHE'S STRONGER THAN I AM.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.042
THIS HAS TO END. I'VE BEEN
LIVING LIKE AN ANIMAL.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.420
(clatters)

13:50.600 --> 13:53.233
OKAY. I COULDN'T STICK
TO THE STUPID DIET.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.866
TURNS OUT MY FAVORITE FOOD
IS GLUTEN. HA. WHO KNEW?

13:55.866 --> 13:57.467
YOU WERE EATINGTRASH.

13:57.467 --> 13:59.009
I WAS EATING THE FOOD

13:59.009 --> 14:00.540
THAT BRENDA AND GRANT
TOOK OUT OF THE PANTRY.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.474
IT WASN'T TRASH.
IT WAS AMONG TRASH.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.548
OKAY, YOU WON.
GO AHEAD. GLOAT.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.551
HA HA! YEAH!

14:11.551 --> 14:14.354
ACTUALLY,
I WAS CHEATING, TOO.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.586
WHAT?!

14:16.586 --> 14:19.329
AND YOU LET ME EATTRASH?

14:19.329 --> 14:22.262
LOOK, WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT
WHETHER I LET YOU EAT TRASH

14:22.262 --> 14:24.534
OR... AMONG TRASH,

14:24.534 --> 14:26.967
OR WE CAN GO OUT THERE
AND GRAB WHAT'S LEFT

14:26.967 --> 14:28.498
BEFORE THE GARBAGEMAN
GETS IT.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.402
OH!

14:40.450 --> 14:43.053
(mouth full) I LOVE YOU
SO FLUFFIN' MUCH.

14:43.053 --> 14:44.884
MM.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.986
MM. MM.
(Nathan) MOM! DAD!

14:45.986 --> 14:47.317
MM! MM.

14:50.220 --> 14:53.893
(singsongy) I FIGURED OUT
MY PROJECT FOR SCIENCE CLUB!

14:53.893 --> 14:54.965
(both) MM?

14:54.965 --> 14:56.596
I'M DOING IT ON GLUTEN.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.627
MM-HMM.
MM.

14:57.627 --> 14:58.999
WILL YOU GUYS COME AND SPEAK
ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS

14:58.999 --> 15:00.170
TO GIVE UP?

15:00.170 --> 15:01.531
(swallows)

15:01.531 --> 15:02.632
(both) MM-HMM.

15:02.632 --> 15:05.135
GREAT. GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.476
MM.
(clears throat and sniffles)

15:06.476 --> 15:08.238
YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO KEEP LYING TO NATHAN

15:08.238 --> 15:09.239
UNTIL AFTER
HIS SCIENCE PROJECT.

15:09.239 --> 15:10.480
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD.

15:10.480 --> 15:12.182
I KNOW.

15:12.182 --> 15:14.414
SO YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO IT?

15:16.186 --> 15:17.517
OH, I CAN DO IT,

15:17.517 --> 15:20.320
AND IF THIS IS A COMPETITION,
WHICH I BELIEVE IT NOW IS,

15:20.320 --> 15:23.093
I'LL BE ABLE TO LIE
BETTER THAN YOU.

15:24.494 --> 15:27.657
YEAH, YOU PROBABLY WILL.

15:27.657 --> 15:28.658
(chuckles)

15:28.658 --> 15:32.162
(laughs) I WAS LYING.

15:32.162 --> 15:34.404
(laughs) SEE HOW GOOD I AM?

15:34.404 --> 15:36.106
(high-pitched voice) BOOP.

15:40.010 --> 15:41.711
MMM. WELL, HELLO.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.413
WHAT IS THAT?

15:43.413 --> 15:46.176
OH, THIS? JUST SOMETHING WE
PICKED UP AT JIMMY B's SUB SHOP,

15:46.176 --> 15:48.248
BECAUSE, LIKE YOU,
WE HAVE OPTIONS.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.221
150 CALORIES, WRAPPED UP
SUPER NEAT IN A CIABATTA BUN,

15:51.221 --> 15:53.623
WHICH IS
ANOTHER 450 CALORIES.

15:53.623 --> 15:55.655
THAT'S WHY WE ONLY NEED
DRINKS TODAY.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.557
FINE.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.389
(mouths words)

16:00.690 --> 16:02.662
PLEASE DRIVE
TO THE NEXT WINDOW.

16:08.438 --> 16:09.599
'SUP, MILADY.

16:09.599 --> 16:12.342
OH, WHAT'S THIS
YOU'RE UPSET ABOUT?

16:12.342 --> 16:14.074
JUST A FULLY LOADED OPTION
I HAVE.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.705
(kisses)

16:18.278 --> 16:19.679
(chuckles)
SHE WITHHELD THE STRAWS.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.681
DUDE, IT'S TOTALLY WORKING.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.617
YOUR SCIENCE IS SOUND,

16:27.617 --> 16:29.059
BUT REMEMBER,
WHEN TALKING ABOUT GLUTEN,

16:29.059 --> 16:31.121
DON'T BE AFRAID TO UNLEASH
YOUR RAGE.

16:31.121 --> 16:35.095
I DON'T HAVE RAGE.
I ONLY HAVE ANXIETY.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.726
SO AFTER I SPEAK,

16:36.726 --> 16:41.271
YOU GUYS WILL TALK ABOUT HOW
HARD IT WAS TO STOP EATING IT.

16:41.271 --> 16:43.533
(lowered voice) IT'S SO HARD
TO KEEP LYING TO HIM.

16:43.533 --> 16:44.634
(lowered voice)
YOU GONNA FOLD?

16:44.634 --> 16:47.037
NOPE. IF I CAN EAT BISCOTTI
PICKED OUT OF DRYER LINT,

16:47.037 --> 16:49.279
I CAN KEEP LYING TO MY SON
FOR ANOTHER 30 MINUTES.

16:49.279 --> 16:52.042
MY PROJECT IS
THE SCIENCE OF LYING--

16:52.042 --> 16:54.484
HOW YOU CAN TELL
IF SOMEONE IS HIDING THE TRUTH

16:54.484 --> 16:56.246
JUST BY OBSERVING THEM.

16:56.246 --> 16:58.748
WELL, WE WEREN'T COUNTING
ON THAT LITTLE TURD, WERE WE?

16:58.748 --> 17:02.021
LIARS!THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.

17:06.456 --> 17:08.458
IT'S BEEN A HALF-HOUR,
AND THEY HAVEN'T COME AFTER US.

17:08.458 --> 17:09.659
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO
TALK TO THEM.

17:09.659 --> 17:13.133
WE GOTTA STICK TO THE PLAN.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.734
(both sigh)

17:14.734 --> 17:15.765
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

17:15.765 --> 17:17.267
I ALMOST DIED YESTERDAY.

17:17.267 --> 17:18.768
THEY SAID THAT SPIDER
WASN'T POISONOUS.

17:18.768 --> 17:19.769
FINE, BUT WHEN IT BIT ME--

17:19.769 --> 17:20.770
THEY SAID
IT DIDN'T BITE YOU.

17:20.770 --> 17:21.641
WELL, THE POINT IS,

17:21.641 --> 17:23.543
WHEN I WAS AS GOOD AS DEAD
ON THAT TABLE,

17:23.543 --> 17:25.775
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I EVER
MADE IT THROUGH THIS...

17:25.775 --> 17:27.217
WHICH WAS INEVITABLE.

17:27.217 --> 17:29.419
I WOULD LIVE EVERY MOMENT
LIKE IT WAS MY LAST.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.222
WE'VE GOTTA TAKE ACTION,
KENNY.

17:32.222 --> 17:34.124

17:34.124 --> 17:35.155
(brakes squeal)

17:35.155 --> 17:37.527
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT OTHER FAST FOOD.

17:37.527 --> 17:40.090
I ONLY CARE ABOUT YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU.

17:40.090 --> 17:42.492
OH, CRAIG.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOU, TOO.

17:42.492 --> 17:44.734
THEN COME WITH ME
RIGHT NOW.

17:44.734 --> 17:47.297
HERE.

17:47.297 --> 17:48.638
YOU GOTTA--

17:48.638 --> 17:51.271
I'M TAKING YOU...

17:51.271 --> 17:52.772

OH, YEAH.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.299
AND NOW I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY HEROES,

18:19.299 --> 18:22.132
STARTING WITH MY DAD,
WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO FIND

18:22.132 --> 18:24.774
THE DISCIPLINE I NEEDED
TO CHANGE MY LIFE.

(smacks lips)

18:36.286 --> 18:39.249
GIVING UP GLUTEN WAS HARD...
(sighs)

18:39.249 --> 18:42.622
BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE, OBVIOUSLY,

18:42.622 --> 18:46.156
UH, BECAUSE... I DID IT.
(chuckles)

18:46.156 --> 18:47.897

STANDING HERE?

18:47.897 --> 18:49.459
(chuckles) HUH?

18:49.459 --> 18:51.731
I GAVE UP GLUTEN.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.365
(sighs and whispers) YEAH.

18:55.365 --> 18:57.567
(normal voice) UM...
(whispers) "EXCESSIVE"...

18:57.567 --> 19:00.740
(sighs, normal voice)
WOW. IT'S--IT'S REALLY...

19:00.740 --> 19:03.913
UM, SO, UH, MY--MY, UM, MY--

19:03.913 --> 19:05.875

YOU'RE STAMMERING.

19:05.875 --> 19:07.817

OH, YOU'RE GOING DOWN!

19:10.650 --> 19:15.685
SO MY--MY, UM,
MY--MY, UH, JOURNEY THAT, UM,

19:15.685 --> 19:17.227
THAT BROUGHT ME HERE...

19:17.227 --> 19:20.730
I CHEATED! I'VE BEEN EATING
THINGS I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO!

19:20.730 --> 19:22.362
I HAD POTATO CHIPS,

19:22.362 --> 19:24.934
AND I HID GUMMY WORMS IN
MY JUSTIN BIEBER COIN PURSE.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.766
(sighs) OH.

19:32.902 --> 19:36.175
I ATE GLUTEN, TOO.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.607
(lowered voice) YES.

19:37.607 --> 19:41.180
(high-pitched, singsong voice)
IN YOUR FACE. WINNER.

19:44.814 --> 19:46.256
I ATE IT, TOO.

19:46.256 --> 19:48.888
LIKE, A LOT.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.821
PROBABLY MORE THAN I EVER ATE
BEFORE I TRIED NOT TO EAT IT.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.225
(sighs) I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.766
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:56.766 --> 19:59.669
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH YOU GUYS
DON'T HAVE DISCIPLINE,

19:59.669 --> 20:01.271
YOU SHOWED ME THAT I DO.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.206
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.608
(grunts)
(Brenda) CAN YOU IMAGINE?

20:08.608 --> 20:10.780
LYING LIKE THAT WHEN
GOOD HEALTH IS SO IMPORTANT.

20:10.780 --> 20:12.482
I LIED, TOO.
REALLY?

20:12.482 --> 20:14.584
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,
YOU WERE WORKING A DOUBLE SHIFT,

20:14.584 --> 20:18.948
AND I SOUGHT COMFORT WITH
A TEMPTRESS NAMED CHEESY BREAD.

20:18.948 --> 20:22.892
IT'S OKAY, BABY.
ACTUALLY, I...

20:22.892 --> 20:24.994
FORGIVE YOU.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.757
MAYBE FROM NOW ON
WE TRY NOT BEING COMPETITIVE

20:27.757 --> 20:28.798
WITH EACH OTHER.

20:28.798 --> 20:31.401
GREAT IDEA.
MM-HMM. (chuckles)

20:31.401 --> 20:33.803
(inhales deeply) BUT YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO STICK TO IT.

20:33.803 --> 20:36.266
OH, YEAH? YOU THINK
I CAN'T NOT BE COMPETITIVE?

20:36.266 --> 20:37.567
I KNOW YOU CAN'T NOT.

20:37.567 --> 20:38.908
CARE TO NOT MAKE IT
UNINTERESTING?

20:38.908 --> 20:40.870
OH, YES, I DON'T.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.313
I THINK WE BOTH JUST LOST.

DRIVE-THRU HEADSET, SWEETIE.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.444
