WEBVTT

00:00.127 --> 00:01.461
Previously, on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.686 --> 00:03.788
I found it. The shipment that
arrived in New York

00:03.888 --> 00:05.855
from Stanton Parish's factory.
All right, shh, shh-

00:05.923 --> 00:07.356
This is it,
the manifest.

00:07.424 --> 00:08.732
It says,
"industrial electronics."

00:12.432 --> 00:14.666
Boxes were here.
Thousands of them.

00:14.734 --> 00:16.335
Parish already
has them.

00:16.403 --> 00:19.173
- Who are you?
- I'm Stanton Parish.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.376
I'm here
to make you an offer.

00:21.443 --> 00:22.945
A child like Zoe,
she needs an environment

00:23.012 --> 00:26.348
that she can thrive in,
as do you.

00:26.416 --> 00:27.750
You think you're gonna
come in here

00:27.818 --> 00:28.818
and start giving us orders?
Rosen invited us.

00:28.886 --> 00:30.187
What?

00:30.255 --> 00:31.622
Told me I had free access
to all the intel.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.958
The investigation is not
gonna be run by this team.

00:34.025 --> 00:35.326
Well, Cley's back
at our office

00:35.394 --> 00:36.562
rifling
through our stuff.

00:36.629 --> 00:39.398
You seriously gonna
trust this to him?

00:39.465 --> 00:41.100
Show me your hands
right now.

00:41.167 --> 00:44.371
- Hey, what's your name?
- Uh--Mitchell.

00:44.439 --> 00:46.407
Why are you
locked in this room?

00:46.474 --> 00:48.609
Well, I have to be here.
I'm very important.

00:48.677 --> 00:51.913
Yeah? Says who?

00:51.981 --> 00:53.948
Stanton Parish.

00:54.016 --> 00:55.750
So he touches you, right,
and zap!

00:55.818 --> 00:58.454
He records whatever memory
you're thinking about.

00:58.522 --> 01:00.223
So he's
a total recall Alpha.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.858
Hello, Mitchell.

01:01.925 --> 01:04.294
Can you show me the last time
you spoke with Mr. Parish?

01:07.866 --> 01:10.234
I promise you,

01:10.302 --> 01:13.071
you will grow old
in a better world than I have.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.743
Parish won't let you
keep Mitchell chipped.

01:17.810 --> 01:18.911
He'll come for him.

01:18.979 --> 01:19.979
Let him come.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.289 --> 01:30.491
It's all right, baby.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.892
It's gonna be okay.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.128
Aww.

01:34.196 --> 01:36.965
- What's so funny?
- You, the baby whisperer.

01:37.032 --> 01:39.134
Yeah?
Make you a little jealous.

01:39.201 --> 01:40.468
- I'm not jealous.
- Ah, you are.

01:40.536 --> 01:42.771
- Maybe I'm a little jealous.
- I can tell.

01:42.838 --> 01:45.507
- Maybe a little.
- Don't worry, because you--

01:45.575 --> 01:48.110
you been great
with this kid.

01:48.178 --> 01:52.348
When it comes time
for us

01:52.415 --> 01:54.884
to have our own,

01:54.952 --> 01:56.720
you're gonna be great
with him too, all right?

01:56.787 --> 01:58.488
Even if I am,

01:58.556 --> 02:00.056
what kind of world
are they gonna grow up in?

02:00.124 --> 02:01.024
No, no, no, we're not gonna
have this conversation now.

02:01.091 --> 02:02.659
Things are getting so--

02:02.726 --> 02:04.527
Now, then,
fresh spring air--

02:06.930 --> 02:08.497
What was that?
Look out!

02:10.667 --> 02:11.768
You're okay.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.003
Stay here.
Stay down.

02:18.610 --> 02:20.911
Okay, listen up.

02:20.979 --> 02:23.781
We've got one dead,
three injured.

02:23.849 --> 02:26.317
This is the fifth attack
on the power grid this week.

02:26.385 --> 02:29.120
There's no discernible pattern
to the attacks,

02:29.188 --> 02:31.490
but on the bright side,

02:31.557 --> 02:33.125
in a day or two, we'll have
these power grid protectors

02:33.193 --> 02:34.560
in place everywhere,

02:34.628 --> 02:36.195
so Parish will have
a hard time keeping this up.

02:36.263 --> 02:39.031
The DOD says Parish is
building up to something big,

02:39.099 --> 02:41.500
and since his last plan
targeted the entire city,

02:41.568 --> 02:43.235
we're expecting this one
to be even bigger,

02:43.303 --> 02:45.171
and according
to these intercepts,

02:45.239 --> 02:46.906
it's gonna happen within
the next few days.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.982
Two days from now
is October 22.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.817
Yes.

02:56.885 --> 03:00.421
October 22, 1862.

03:00.489 --> 03:01.922
A Union officer was shot
in the head

03:01.990 --> 03:04.324
and apparently killed.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.860
Then, he miraculously
came back to life.

03:08.163 --> 03:11.065
And that is when
Stanton Parish

03:11.133 --> 03:13.568
discovered he was
an Alpha.

03:13.635 --> 03:15.169
So what are you saying?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.571
This is some sort of
twisted birthday party?

03:16.638 --> 03:19.474
- Yes.
- 150 years to the day.

03:19.542 --> 03:21.910
Terrorists love
anniversaries.

03:21.978 --> 03:23.879
Look, the plan is
to keep pressuring

03:23.947 --> 03:25.280
his organization.

03:25.348 --> 03:27.082
D.C. thinks
that if we push hard enough,

03:27.150 --> 03:28.550
eventually
something's gonna snap.

03:28.618 --> 03:30.919
The best lead that we have is
that electronic shipment

03:30.987 --> 03:32.254
that we
almost intercepted.

03:32.321 --> 03:33.755
That's gotta be
a part of this.

03:33.823 --> 03:35.056
We don't even know
what Parish was planning to do

03:35.124 --> 03:36.257
with those components.
Yeah, well, that's why

03:36.325 --> 03:37.592
Rachel is looking
for Skylar Adams.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.293
Skylar knows how
to figure these things out,

03:39.361 --> 03:40.561
if we can find her.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.995
I'm doing my best,

03:42.063 --> 03:44.464
but Skylar is very good
at not being found.

03:44.532 --> 03:46.233
Folks, we're talking
about two days from now.

03:46.301 --> 03:47.735
We're still boxing
in the dark.

03:47.802 --> 03:49.603
We need to find a way
to Parish,

03:49.671 --> 03:50.904
and find it fast.

03:50.972 --> 03:53.307
Now we--we gotta
get inside Parish's head.

03:53.375 --> 03:55.943
Mitchell Morgan,
page four.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.012
If you want to get inside
Parish's head, he's the answer.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.780
- Parish's memory guy?
- Yes.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.115
Oh, I thought Parish
was only using him

04:01.183 --> 04:03.651
to store sentimental stuff.
Yes, he did.

04:03.718 --> 04:05.920
I think there may be a way
to dig deeper,

04:05.988 --> 04:08.289
but we'd need to move him
to a more appropriate facility,

04:08.357 --> 04:10.992
and New York Psychiatric
has a, uh, secure unit.

04:11.059 --> 04:12.727
You want me to transfer
a high-value asset

04:12.795 --> 04:15.530
out of Building Seven
in the middle of all this?

04:15.597 --> 04:18.166
Yes, that is
what I am asking.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.334
I could
go with you.

04:20.402 --> 04:22.937
Mitchell knows me.
I can make him more comfortable.

04:23.005 --> 04:24.572
I'd rather you not, Kat.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.107
I'm freshly trained
in all this stuff,

04:26.175 --> 04:27.942
and what I don't know, I can
learn in, like, ten minutes.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.845
Well, learning is not quite
the same thing as applying.

04:30.912 --> 04:32.747
Doc, she aced Quantico
in two weeks.

04:32.815 --> 04:34.048
- Bill--
- Look, the clock's ticking.

04:34.116 --> 04:35.449
I'll take whatever help
I can get.

04:40.422 --> 04:42.156
All right, fine.
Just get it done.

04:44.593 --> 04:48.295
Sir.

04:51.433 --> 04:53.400
We're stocked up
on meds.

04:53.468 --> 04:56.203
Transportation's in place.
Doctors are reporting soon.

04:56.271 --> 04:58.538
Have we gotten what we need
from Skylar Adams yet?

04:58.606 --> 05:01.141
Vince is working her
as fast as he can.

05:01.209 --> 05:03.944
That is simply not
good enough.

05:07.482 --> 05:09.216
I'll have a word
with Vincent.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.220
It's all
coming together now.

05:13.287 --> 05:14.821
People will be scared.

05:14.889 --> 05:19.159
They'll need a place to go
for the transition.

05:19.227 --> 05:21.661
It's Danielle's idea.

05:21.729 --> 05:23.563
Her legacy.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.334
Hey, Jeannie.

05:27.402 --> 05:28.869
Oh, sweetie.
Just stay at your mom's.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.104
You'll be all right.

05:31.172 --> 05:34.041
Okay?
Yeah, I love you too.

05:34.108 --> 05:35.642
Yeah, kiss the baby.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.512
All right. Bye.

05:38.579 --> 05:40.981
That Jeannie?
How is she?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.717
She's traumatized,
of course.

05:43.785 --> 05:46.286
Bill, I think I--

05:46.354 --> 05:49.923
I have an alternative approach
to this whole thing,

05:49.991 --> 05:52.393
a way to take it
directly to Parish.

05:52.461 --> 05:53.627
That's great,
because I'm expecting

05:53.695 --> 05:54.862
a conference call
from D.C. right now.

05:54.929 --> 05:56.230
I'll run it by them,
see if it flies.

05:57.365 --> 05:59.833
Speaking of which.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.669
Harken.
Yep.

06:05.107 --> 06:06.308
You don't want
to do that.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.442
No.

06:07.510 --> 06:09.278
This is
strictly unofficial,

06:09.345 --> 06:10.813
you understand?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.849
Do I understand?
You--

06:13.917 --> 06:15.717
can you hold, please?

06:15.785 --> 06:17.686
Do I understand?

06:17.754 --> 06:20.389
Parish's organization
is huge and nasty

06:20.457 --> 06:22.157
and about to pull the trigger
on something big.

06:22.225 --> 06:25.528
Cley needs all of us to be
rowing in the same direction,

06:25.595 --> 06:28.764
okay, that's NYPD,
that's DOD, and us--

06:28.832 --> 06:30.867
I realize that.

06:30.934 --> 06:32.168
Look, you--
you either

06:32.236 --> 06:33.402
grab an oar
or get the hell out the boat.

06:33.470 --> 06:34.770
We don't have time
to do anything cute.

06:34.838 --> 06:36.039
Knock, knock.

06:36.106 --> 06:38.174
Sorry to interrupt.

06:38.242 --> 06:39.910
You got that, right?

06:39.978 --> 06:40.944
No, not you, okay?

06:41.012 --> 06:42.446
Yeah.

06:42.514 --> 06:43.881
No, you're right.

06:43.948 --> 06:46.116
Of course.
Yeah, okay.

06:50.388 --> 06:51.488
He didn't go for it.

06:51.556 --> 06:56.193
His involvement
isn't critical.

06:56.261 --> 06:58.962
What if he gets
in our way?

06:59.030 --> 07:00.597
Well, let's just hope
he doesn't.

07:00.665 --> 07:03.200
Good luck.

07:03.268 --> 07:04.435
All right,
give me five.

07:04.503 --> 07:05.803
Mmhmm.

07:17.683 --> 07:19.750
Okay, lead vehicle,
call out your turns.

07:19.818 --> 07:21.486
Advance team,
maintain lockup.

07:21.553 --> 07:23.020
Copy that.

07:23.088 --> 07:25.089
You really think Rosen can
get more intel out of this guy?

07:25.157 --> 07:27.091
Yeah.

07:27.158 --> 07:28.792
Nobody knows Parish
as well as Mitchell.

07:28.860 --> 07:30.161
Sucks he's chipped.

07:30.228 --> 07:32.096
He was a good guy
to road trip with.

07:32.164 --> 07:35.232
Yeah, if you say so.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.268
Hey, blondie, you're following
too close to the lead vehicle.

07:37.336 --> 07:38.369
50 feet.

07:38.437 --> 07:39.804
Maintain a constant
driving speed.

07:39.872 --> 07:41.039
Yeah, how about we switch?

07:41.107 --> 07:43.775
You drive,
and I'll boss you around?

07:43.843 --> 07:45.544
My feet won't reach
the pedals.

08:10.069 --> 08:11.102
Kat, you okay?

08:11.170 --> 08:12.904
- Yeah!
- Watch Mitchell.

08:14.874 --> 08:16.008
Damn it,
it's Scipio!

08:19.946 --> 08:22.114
Come on!
Red team with me.

08:22.182 --> 08:23.415
Blue team
stay with the truck.

08:27.220 --> 08:29.521
Holy crap.

08:39.264 --> 08:41.099
Put him down, now!

08:48.374 --> 08:50.208
Ow.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.584
Move!

08:59.652 --> 09:04.022
Go, go!

09:04.090 --> 09:05.089
Blue team, fan out.

09:05.157 --> 09:07.158
Cover the stairwells.

09:07.226 --> 09:08.559
Stairwells are secure,

09:08.627 --> 09:09.927
but no sign of him.

09:09.995 --> 09:10.895
Where the hell
did he go?

09:10.962 --> 09:12.262
There's no way
he got past us.

09:12.330 --> 09:14.331
- I lost Mitchell too.
- Nothing here.

09:14.399 --> 09:15.465
Damn it!

09:15.533 --> 09:17.000
Cover the exits!
Yes, sir!

09:17.067 --> 09:20.470
Spread out!

with that in due time.

10:04.081 --> 10:06.850
Almost done.

10:06.918 --> 10:09.086
Thank you, Doctor.

10:09.154 --> 10:10.954
You're all dismissed.

10:14.893 --> 10:16.627
I said dismissed,
Mr. Kowalka.

10:28.439 --> 10:30.340
Mitchell?

10:30.407 --> 10:33.509
Hey, Stanton.

10:33.577 --> 10:35.144
How are you feeling?

10:35.212 --> 10:37.313
Uh

10:37.381 --> 10:38.614
my neck hurts.

10:38.682 --> 10:40.450
We removed the chip
they inserted.

10:43.220 --> 10:47.223
It's really good
to see you again.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.223
May I?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.158
Yeah.

11:08.477 --> 11:11.678
They're gone.

11:11.746 --> 11:13.280
Rosen did this, didn't he?

11:13.348 --> 11:15.816
He erased my memories.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.017
Dr. Rosen.

11:17.085 --> 11:18.952
Yeah.

11:21.923 --> 11:23.891
He, um--

11:23.959 --> 11:26.460
he gave me an IV,
and--and, uh,

11:26.528 --> 11:28.162
a few injections
about three days ago--

11:28.230 --> 11:31.966
no, about--
about four days ago.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.836
After that,

11:35.904 --> 11:38.272
all the extra stuff
was just...

11:38.340 --> 11:40.174
gone.

11:42.377 --> 11:44.679
It's funny.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.482
For the first time
in years,

11:47.549 --> 11:51.619
I actually feel like--

11:51.687 --> 11:54.588
like me,

11:54.656 --> 11:56.290
you know?

11:56.358 --> 11:59.193
Like me.

12:14.210 --> 12:15.144
You were right.

12:15.211 --> 12:17.279
Parish took the bait.

12:17.347 --> 12:18.514
Did we get what we need?

12:18.581 --> 12:20.182
Yeah,
I just--

12:20.249 --> 12:21.450
I feel bad for Kat.

12:21.517 --> 12:22.784
Well, so do I,

12:22.852 --> 12:24.853
but she'll forget everything
in two weeks.

12:24.921 --> 12:26.889
That's something.
I just--

12:26.956 --> 12:29.192
I wish it didn't have
to go that far.

12:29.259 --> 12:30.527
As do I, Nina.

12:30.595 --> 12:32.228
Hicks.

12:35.666 --> 12:37.500
It's them.

12:43.575 --> 12:44.975
How is he?

12:45.043 --> 12:46.877
Alive.

12:57.222 --> 12:58.889
Is everything ready?

12:58.957 --> 13:00.458
Yeah, he's still out.

13:00.525 --> 13:03.761
I can smell the tranq working
its way through his system.

13:03.829 --> 13:05.630
I got this.

13:18.177 --> 13:20.045
Wake up, sunshine.

13:20.113 --> 13:23.281
We need to talk.

13:23.349 --> 13:26.183
Hello, Cornell.

13:30.814 --> 13:32.315
It's all come down to this,
hasn't it?

13:32.383 --> 13:35.385
Is this really
who you want to be, Cornell?

13:35.452 --> 13:37.754
Someone responsible for
the death of millions of people?

13:37.821 --> 13:38.755
Is this what you
really want?

13:38.823 --> 13:41.258
What I want...

13:41.326 --> 13:43.760
is a lawyer.

13:43.828 --> 13:46.362
So what, I don't have
civil rights?

13:46.430 --> 13:47.563
Why?
'Cause I'm not human?

13:47.631 --> 13:49.999
You're very much
a human, Cornell.

13:50.067 --> 13:52.535
You just choose
to deny the fact,

13:52.603 --> 13:54.103
but there's still time.

13:54.171 --> 13:56.940
Actually, there's a lot
less time than you think, Doc.

13:58.743 --> 13:59.710
Hey, you know,
the way I'm tied up

13:59.777 --> 14:00.978
I could burn myself,

14:01.046 --> 14:03.514
if I accidentally
trigger my ability.

14:03.582 --> 14:05.250
We wouldn't want that,
would we?

14:05.317 --> 14:08.019
I know it's bothered you
for a very long time

14:08.087 --> 14:10.188
how closely aligned
your emotional state is

14:10.256 --> 14:11.489
with your ability,

14:11.557 --> 14:13.725
that you've always wanted
to transcend it.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.760
Well, you can right now.

14:15.828 --> 14:17.595
Seriously?

14:17.663 --> 14:18.730
That's the best you got?

14:18.797 --> 14:21.165
You try
to head-shrink me

14:21.233 --> 14:24.435
into getting in touch
with my humanity?

14:24.503 --> 14:27.271
Where were you when I
set my parents' house on fire?

14:29.408 --> 14:32.744
No, you're 20 years
too late, Doc.

14:32.812 --> 14:34.946
We need
to move things along.

14:35.014 --> 14:37.449
Heh.

14:41.321 --> 14:43.122
Two weeks ago,

14:43.189 --> 14:46.424
Parish shipped a large number
of electronic components

14:46.492 --> 14:48.861
from China to New York.

14:48.928 --> 14:50.496
What do you know
about that?

14:50.564 --> 14:52.932
Gone.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.500
They've moved.

14:54.568 --> 14:55.534
Where did they go?

14:55.602 --> 14:56.636
Parish doesn't tell me.

14:56.703 --> 14:57.937
It's above my pay grade.

14:58.005 --> 15:00.940
Were there other shipments?

15:01.008 --> 15:03.075
Answer her.

15:03.143 --> 15:04.777
Hundreds.

15:04.845 --> 15:06.446
Stuff's been coming in
for months.

15:06.514 --> 15:09.850
Ask him about Parish.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.820
Where is he?
Where's Stanton Parish?

15:12.887 --> 15:16.090
Where is he right now?

15:17.259 --> 15:19.561
Where is Stanton Parish?

15:19.629 --> 15:20.629
Answer me!

15:20.697 --> 15:23.866
Where is he right now?

15:23.934 --> 15:25.167
Wouldn't you like
to know.

15:25.235 --> 15:27.537
The last time you
spoke with Parish,

15:27.604 --> 15:29.405
where did it take place?

15:29.473 --> 15:32.575
Aah, bite me!

15:32.643 --> 15:34.610
Nina, he's blocked,

15:34.678 --> 15:36.913
just like the Senator.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.615
Oh, yeah, I got a vault
in there, boys and girls.

15:39.683 --> 15:41.450
It's ironclad.

15:41.518 --> 15:43.419
Well, let's unlock it,
shall we?

15:43.486 --> 15:47.990
- Ooh.
- Rachel, amobarbital, 15ccs.

15:48.057 --> 15:50.826
Amowhat?

16:01.704 --> 16:02.670
Oh--

16:02.738 --> 16:05.573
15ccs, in.

16:12.381 --> 16:14.883
You gotta let it go, Kat,
you know?

16:14.950 --> 16:16.551
Sounds to me like
you did your best--

16:16.618 --> 16:17.819
excuse me, good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

16:17.886 --> 16:19.553
Yeah, except
I lost Mitchell

16:19.621 --> 16:21.021
and Jeff Kowalka.

16:21.089 --> 16:22.656
Plus, I had Cornell Scipio
in my hands,

16:22.724 --> 16:23.724
and I let him go too.

16:23.792 --> 16:24.992
So basically, I suck.

16:25.060 --> 16:26.393
Well, sometimes in life
that happens.

16:26.461 --> 16:28.428
Really?
Really, we're gonna do that?

16:28.496 --> 16:30.530
We got more important things
to worry about.

16:30.597 --> 16:32.331
Tomorrow's the 22nd.

16:32.399 --> 16:33.933
Yeah, I know,
the world's gonna end.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.368
Look, Rosen said that Mitchell
is the key to everything, right,

16:36.436 --> 16:38.204
so let me just--

16:38.272 --> 16:39.805
let me just recheck the scene.
Maybe I missed something.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.008
Call Rachel, okay?
It's her department.

16:43.076 --> 16:44.110
Yeah, no,
I thought of that.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.244
Can't get through.
You try Nina?

16:45.312 --> 16:46.311
Nina always knows
where she is.

16:46.379 --> 16:47.713
Yes, I thought
of that too.

16:47.781 --> 16:49.114
She's not answering
her phone.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.617
In fact, I haven't seen
either of them since yesterday.

16:51.684 --> 16:53.752
- What?
- Should we be worried?

16:53.820 --> 16:54.687
You know what?
Why don't you

16:54.754 --> 16:57.156
go check the scene?

16:57.224 --> 16:59.057
Hicks.
Hey--

16:59.125 --> 17:00.225
Hicks?

17:00.293 --> 17:01.460
I'll take care of it.
Hicks?

17:01.527 --> 17:03.195
Bill.
Bill!

17:03.262 --> 17:04.329
- Hey.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

17:04.396 --> 17:05.663
- I figured it out.
- Good for you.

17:05.731 --> 17:06.864
- I--aw, thanks.
- You're supposed to be

17:06.932 --> 17:08.665
in the hospital.
No, sarcasm.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.268
No, Gary, go back,
spend time with your mother.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.868
Oh...no,
they kicked me out, Bill.

17:11.936 --> 17:13.537
The head nurse said
that I was disruptive,

17:13.605 --> 17:16.006
and I said that she
looked like an animal.

17:16.074 --> 17:17.375
But then--then when I was
All right, Gary...

17:17.442 --> 17:19.443
- In the cab, I f--
- What's the point, Gary?

17:19.511 --> 17:22.380
Oh, I--I was scanning
for Skylar in the cab, Bill,

17:22.446 --> 17:24.615
and--and the cab had GPS,
which is crazy,

17:24.683 --> 17:26.349
'cause New York streets
are on a numbered grid,

17:26.417 --> 17:28.786
so they--they don't even
need the GPS, Bill.

17:28.854 --> 17:30.754
Gary, Gary, we're gonna
be dead by the time

17:30.822 --> 17:32.356
you finish this story.
Mm-

17:32.424 --> 17:34.158
No, Bill,
it was the chip.

17:34.226 --> 17:36.026
The cab had a chip,
and Skylar

17:36.094 --> 17:37.528
has a chip.
It's in her arm.

17:37.596 --> 17:39.363
She uses it to communicate
with her wasps.

17:39.431 --> 17:41.632
So I just--
I ping it,

17:41.700 --> 17:43.067
and now she knows
that I wanna communicate.

17:43.135 --> 17:45.303
She's gonna call me back.

17:51.677 --> 17:53.711
Hey, Dij?

17:53.779 --> 17:56.781
Do you hear that buzzing?

17:56.848 --> 18:00.818
You need to finish, or Vince
won't bring me popsicles.

18:00.886 --> 18:04.355
I'm going as fast
as I can.

18:04.422 --> 18:06.557
You really
don't hear that?

18:06.624 --> 18:07.858
Maybe it's the phone.

18:07.926 --> 18:10.294
Where's the phone?

18:10.362 --> 18:12.062
We don't have one.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.631
We don't have a phone?

18:14.699 --> 18:16.066
Why don't we have a phone?

18:16.134 --> 18:19.770
We just don't.

18:21.172 --> 18:24.542
Vince!

18:24.609 --> 18:26.009
Hey, Zoe.

18:26.077 --> 18:27.010
How's it goin',
Miss Adams?

18:27.078 --> 18:28.378
It's Skylar.

18:28.446 --> 18:30.047
Yes, ma'am.

18:30.115 --> 18:31.949
Popsicles!
Popsicles!

18:32.017 --> 18:34.918
Your wish is my command.

18:34.986 --> 18:38.456
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:38.523 --> 18:40.657
Orange.
My favorite.

18:40.725 --> 18:43.460
You always know
exactly what she wants.

18:43.528 --> 18:45.029
Just trying
to make her happy.

18:45.096 --> 18:47.364
Is, um,
this for me?

18:47.432 --> 18:49.199
Well, it's not done yet.

18:49.267 --> 18:51.368
Still haven't found a way
to get it to cut bone

18:51.435 --> 18:54.771
without releasing
a crapload of bacteria.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.807
You promised me
it would be done.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.509
You don't want
to get me in trouble, do you?

18:59.577 --> 19:00.711
No.

19:00.778 --> 19:02.279
No, I want to
do this for you.

19:02.347 --> 19:04.915
Good, good.

19:04.983 --> 19:06.350
I have an idea.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.418
Why don't I look after Zoe
for a little while

19:08.486 --> 19:11.054
so that you can, um,
concentrate on your work.

19:11.122 --> 19:12.155
Thanks.

19:12.223 --> 19:14.391
You're welcome.

19:14.459 --> 19:16.292
Zoe.

19:20.531 --> 19:22.499
How much longer?

19:22.567 --> 19:24.468
What's your problem?

19:24.535 --> 19:25.569
I got you
a lot of stuff already.

19:25.636 --> 19:27.904
I mean--I mean,
all kind of tech.

19:27.972 --> 19:28.972
That first thing
she did for you?

19:29.040 --> 19:30.540
That flashy thing?

19:30.608 --> 19:33.911
You acted like it was
Christmas morn--

19:33.979 --> 19:37.114
What is my problem?
What is my problem?

19:37.182 --> 19:41.585
I want that device,
and I need it now.

19:41.653 --> 19:42.620
All right--

19:42.687 --> 19:44.155
all right, look, man.

19:44.222 --> 19:46.190
Something's wigging her out,
okay?

19:46.257 --> 19:49.059
I am trying
to keep her focused.

19:49.127 --> 19:51.028
You have no idea
how hard that is.

19:51.096 --> 19:53.664
Nor do I care.

19:53.732 --> 19:55.532
You promised me
you'd get the job done.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.335
I intend to hold you
to that.

19:58.403 --> 20:01.139
Understood?
Uhhuh.

20:14.387 --> 20:16.354
Focus on the walls.

20:16.422 --> 20:18.556
Are they white?
Are they blue?

20:18.624 --> 20:20.291
Were they green?
Focus!

20:20.359 --> 20:22.527
All right, you can ask
the question any way you want.

20:22.595 --> 20:24.061
The answer
is gonna be the same--

20:24.129 --> 20:25.663
up your ass.

20:25.731 --> 20:27.832
Nina, deep breaths.
Your pulse is racing.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.634
I just--
I just need a break.

20:31.937 --> 20:33.972
We need to get through.
We got a day, maybe two.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.740
Listen to me.
Nina's exhausted,

20:35.808 --> 20:38.343
and Scipio's blood pressure
is topping off

20:38.411 --> 20:40.212
at 200 systolic.

20:45.150 --> 20:47.885
You're sweating quite a bit
right now.

20:47.953 --> 20:49.988
If I were you,
I wouldn't get too excited.

20:50.056 --> 20:52.257
Dr. Rosen.

20:52.325 --> 20:54.125
We are in over our heads.

20:54.193 --> 20:56.528
I have friends at the CIA
that do this for a living.

20:56.596 --> 20:58.063
It is time
to call in the experts.

20:58.131 --> 21:00.165
No, we're the damn experts.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.234
Now, you know Parish
has people everywhere.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.402
How the hell else
do you think they knew

21:03.470 --> 21:04.670
that Mitchell
was being transferred--

21:04.738 --> 21:05.972
Rachel, we're not
calling anyone else in.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.740
We're doing this
ourselves.

21:10.678 --> 21:12.946
There's some aminorex
in there.

21:13.014 --> 21:14.748
Prepare a 5cc injection,
please.

21:17.719 --> 21:18.785
Aminorex?

21:18.853 --> 21:22.089
Yes, 5ccs,
right now.

21:27.395 --> 21:31.499
Hicks, aminorex can
be dangerous.

21:31.566 --> 21:32.767
What are we doing here?

21:32.834 --> 21:35.703
Getting answers.

21:35.770 --> 21:37.338
Are we, really?

21:37.405 --> 21:38.572
'Cause it seems like
all we're doing

21:38.640 --> 21:40.475
is bashing Nina's head
up against the wall.

21:40.543 --> 21:42.410
What if Scipio's a dead end,
huh?

21:42.478 --> 21:43.745
What if
we're wasting time?

21:43.813 --> 21:45.647
Look, the only one
wasting time is you.

21:45.714 --> 21:48.449
Get what Rosen wants,
and get it in there.

21:57.994 --> 21:59.828
Here's 5ccs of aminorex,

21:59.896 --> 22:01.697
but it won't lower
his pressure,

22:01.764 --> 22:04.099
and it will not
bring down his resistance.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.301
It's a stimulant, Dr. Rosen.

22:06.369 --> 22:09.538
I know.

22:09.606 --> 22:11.874
It's for me, Rache.

22:31.757 --> 22:34.759
I'm sorry.
I just--

22:34.826 --> 22:36.360
I couldn't break through.

22:36.428 --> 22:37.995
You did your best.

22:38.063 --> 22:39.129
Now, it's my turn.

22:39.197 --> 22:41.999
Cameron.

22:42.066 --> 22:44.902
I have another idea.

22:56.349 --> 22:57.483
Gary.

22:57.551 --> 22:59.585
Come on, I need something
from you.

22:59.653 --> 23:01.453
Skylar is
ignoring me still.

23:01.521 --> 23:02.822
- Hey--
- It's annoying.

23:02.889 --> 23:03.723
I hate that, Bill...
Look into those things.

23:03.791 --> 23:04.991
When people ignore me.

23:05.059 --> 23:06.058
Gary, listen,
I need you to look

23:06.126 --> 23:07.493
for uh, Rosen. Okay?
Bill-

23:07.561 --> 23:08.728
- See if you can get a location.
- You're ignoring me!

23:08.796 --> 23:09.929
I was talking about Skylar.

23:09.997 --> 23:13.265
Gary, this is important,
okay?

23:13.333 --> 23:14.800
Yeah,
there's no signal.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.001
Just like Nina
and Hicks.

23:16.068 --> 23:17.169
They're all
out of range?

23:17.236 --> 23:18.370
No, they--
no.

23:18.438 --> 23:19.738
They probably just
took the batteries

23:19.806 --> 23:20.973
out of their phones.
Okay, why would three people

23:21.041 --> 23:22.041
take the batteries
out of their phones?

23:22.109 --> 23:23.477
- I don't know.
- Hey--hey.

23:23.545 --> 23:25.679
I went back
and checked the scene.

23:25.747 --> 23:27.348
I found something.

23:27.415 --> 23:29.283
It kinda sucks.

23:31.853 --> 23:32.853
Tranq dart.

23:32.921 --> 23:34.722
One of ours.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.557
Found that
where Scipio disappeared.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.959
Lab confirms blood on the tip
is his.

23:38.026 --> 23:39.594
Oh, he was darted.

23:39.662 --> 23:40.995
I ha-I hate that--
- Gary--

23:41.063 --> 23:42.364
- Being darted, it's exhausting.
- Just--could you--

23:42.431 --> 23:45.132
- c'mon.
- On the dl, please. Quiet.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.568
I already checked
with John.

23:46.636 --> 23:49.538
Nobody on the TAC team
had tranq guns,

23:49.605 --> 23:51.440
which leads
to the question--

23:51.508 --> 23:54.176
who tranq'ed him?

23:54.244 --> 23:57.079
Harken.

23:57.147 --> 23:58.681
No.

23:58.748 --> 24:01.250
I'm just gonna
go in here for a second.

24:15.198 --> 24:16.665
That smells.

24:16.733 --> 24:20.536
We need to finish this.

24:26.009 --> 24:28.710
Mommy, are you okay?

24:28.778 --> 24:29.912
It didn't hurt.

24:29.979 --> 24:32.215
That's good.

24:32.282 --> 24:36.519
It should.

24:36.586 --> 24:39.789
Something's wrong.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.127
What are you doing?

24:45.195 --> 24:47.464
- Looking at something.
- What is that?

24:47.531 --> 24:48.832
Are you a Terminator?

24:48.900 --> 24:50.000
It's a transceiver.

24:50.067 --> 24:51.935
I made it.

24:52.002 --> 24:54.404
It controls my wasps.

24:54.471 --> 24:56.105
Where are my wasps?

24:56.173 --> 24:58.541
So why is it
bothering you?

24:58.609 --> 25:00.377
Someone is trying
to call us.

25:00.444 --> 25:03.113
Maybe we should
call them back, then.

25:12.256 --> 25:13.590
Ohow.

25:13.658 --> 25:15.492
Ow.

25:25.069 --> 25:26.069
Huh.

25:26.136 --> 25:27.804
Skylar.

25:29.172 --> 25:30.740
No!
No--no!

25:30.807 --> 25:33.743
No!

25:33.810 --> 25:36.880
Baby!

25:36.947 --> 25:38.815
Meg.

25:40.818 --> 25:42.185
What did you do
to her?

25:42.253 --> 25:44.354
You wanna be a tough guy,
right? Hmm?

25:44.422 --> 25:46.357
We're just getting started.

25:46.424 --> 25:47.358
I'll let you two catch up.

25:47.425 --> 25:50.428
Son of a bitch!

25:50.495 --> 25:53.498
I'm okay.
Don't tell them anything.

25:53.566 --> 25:55.700
I haven't
told them crap.

25:55.768 --> 25:59.203
Those blocks,
they work like a charm.

25:59.271 --> 26:01.039
What are they after?

26:01.106 --> 26:03.108
What do you think?
Parish.

26:03.175 --> 26:04.142
They want to know
where he is.

26:04.210 --> 26:05.477
He's safe, right?

26:05.544 --> 26:09.180
He isn't still
at the house, is he?

26:09.248 --> 26:10.782
Why?

26:10.850 --> 26:12.984
I'm worried!
I--

26:13.052 --> 26:14.819
I can't think straight.

26:14.887 --> 26:18.023
I'm so sorry, Meg.

26:18.090 --> 26:20.391
I missed you.

26:26.766 --> 26:30.269
You know what's been
getting me by?

26:30.337 --> 26:33.173
Thinking about you and me up
at Saranac Lake.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.308
You remember that cabin?

26:35.376 --> 26:37.310
Yeah, yes.

26:37.378 --> 26:40.147
It's so pretty
up there.

26:46.087 --> 26:47.120
Nice try, bitch.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.622
Meg hates the mountains.

26:48.689 --> 26:51.658
She's got allergies--

26:51.726 --> 26:52.659
Cameron!

26:56.363 --> 26:58.197
You kidnap me--

26:58.265 --> 26:59.398
you beat me,
you drug me

26:59.466 --> 27:02.001
and now you
try to mind-rape me?

27:02.069 --> 27:03.502
- I can do this.
- Just--no.

27:03.570 --> 27:04.570
She's not very good.

27:04.638 --> 27:07.740
Come here.

27:07.808 --> 27:09.975
Hey, Doc.

27:10.043 --> 27:12.578
I was wondering...

27:12.646 --> 27:15.181
about what it's like

27:15.248 --> 27:18.450
to be betrayed
by your own daughter.

27:18.518 --> 27:20.853
I mean, you sent her
to her death,

27:20.921 --> 27:24.624
but she was a liar.
She was a traitor.

27:29.096 --> 27:32.766
She deserved to die,
I think.

27:32.834 --> 27:34.635
Don't you?

27:37.372 --> 27:41.842
Cornell, when you
set your family's home on fire

27:41.910 --> 27:43.844
when you were 15,

27:43.912 --> 27:45.946
did you ever wonder

27:46.014 --> 27:50.083
what your mother and father
and--and sister felt

27:50.151 --> 27:51.250
when they were
burning to death?

27:51.318 --> 27:52.618
Hmm?

27:52.686 --> 27:54.787
Or how
your other victims feel

27:54.855 --> 27:56.122
when you, uh--

27:56.190 --> 27:57.590
how did you put it,
when we--

27:57.658 --> 27:59.926
when we first talked?

27:59.994 --> 28:02.929
When you make
their skin sizzle?

28:02.997 --> 28:05.165
Drop dead, Doc.

28:05.233 --> 28:07.168
This is adrenaline,

28:07.236 --> 28:10.004
and you know
that it triggers your ability,

28:11.707 --> 28:13.975
and while your--
your hands

28:14.043 --> 28:16.711
may be fire-resistant,

28:16.779 --> 28:19.280
the rest of you
is not.

28:19.348 --> 28:22.116
You wouldn't.

28:47.943 --> 28:51.512
This has gone
far enough.

28:51.580 --> 28:53.848
He's a murderer.

28:53.916 --> 28:56.184
This is just
about revenge, isn't it?

28:56.251 --> 28:57.785
You don't like it?
Cover your ears.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.793
I can't stay in here.

29:06.861 --> 29:09.697
Rachel.

29:09.764 --> 29:13.200
I can smell
Scipio's flesh burning.

29:28.322 --> 29:29.455
Skylar.

29:29.523 --> 29:32.158
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

29:32.225 --> 29:33.593
Zoe, you stay there,
okay?

29:33.660 --> 29:35.695
You don't have to do that.

29:35.763 --> 29:37.163
This is a safe place.

29:37.231 --> 29:39.065
Really?

29:39.133 --> 29:40.333
How did I get here?

29:40.401 --> 29:41.802
What'd you do to me?

29:41.869 --> 29:43.103
What'd you do to my daughter?

29:43.171 --> 29:45.673
I just helped you to be happy
for a change.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.109
Happiness...

29:48.176 --> 29:50.044
is a warm gun.

29:56.051 --> 29:59.154
I'm trying to be nice.

29:59.222 --> 30:01.556
If you're nice,
then I'll be nice,

30:01.624 --> 30:03.391
and this place
will be nice.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.428
But if you're not,

30:06.496 --> 30:10.265
well, you don't want this place
to stop being nice.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.503
- Zoe!
- Mommy, help!

30:13.570 --> 30:15.438
Zoe!

30:22.446 --> 30:24.280
Zoe!

30:37.360 --> 30:39.427
There's no way out

30:39.495 --> 30:41.596
unless you do
as you're told.

30:41.664 --> 30:44.599
Zoe!

30:44.667 --> 30:47.035
Zoe!

30:47.103 --> 30:49.204
Zoe!

30:49.272 --> 30:51.473
Zoe!

30:51.541 --> 30:52.708
Zoe!

30:54.277 --> 30:56.479
It's only gonna get worse.

30:56.547 --> 30:58.881
There's no way out.
There's no way out.

30:58.949 --> 31:01.784
- Zoe!
- You're terrified.

31:01.852 --> 31:02.851
Zoe!

31:02.919 --> 31:04.654
- Zoe!
- There's no way out.

31:14.264 --> 31:18.767
Mitchell,
hope you're feeling better.

31:18.835 --> 31:20.936
A little empty,
actually.

31:23.939 --> 31:26.708
All this stuff,
it, uh, looks

31:26.776 --> 31:29.043
like it's really important.

31:29.111 --> 31:32.347
That is correct.

31:32.415 --> 31:35.784
Tomorrow, the world
is going to change.

31:35.851 --> 31:37.686
People may want
to understand

31:37.754 --> 31:40.155
what I was feeling,
thinking,

31:40.223 --> 31:42.357
my intentions.

31:42.425 --> 31:44.960
Do you still have
your ability?

31:45.028 --> 31:48.130
- Yeah.
- Would you allow me?

31:48.198 --> 31:51.133
Yeah.

32:11.286 --> 32:14.755
I'm about to change
the world.

32:14.823 --> 32:18.659
It's just a shame that...
so many people have to die.

32:36.177 --> 32:37.510
I told you
where they are,

32:37.578 --> 32:39.145
I don't know
anything else!

32:41.048 --> 32:42.215
Ahh, ahh!

32:42.283 --> 32:43.283
Need more, Cornell.

32:43.350 --> 32:45.184
I need more details.

32:49.056 --> 32:50.357
Doc!

32:50.425 --> 32:52.726
We got three
DOD SUVs outside.

32:52.794 --> 32:54.194
Uhoh, we need
to go.

32:54.262 --> 32:55.396
I can't take the chance
of anybody

32:55.463 --> 32:56.764
finding out
what I know.

32:56.832 --> 32:57.999
It'll leak to Parish.

32:58.066 --> 32:59.967
You bet your ass
it will.

33:00.035 --> 33:01.803
It's Harken
and Kat outside.

33:01.871 --> 33:03.171
What the hell, Rachel?

33:03.239 --> 33:04.906
You're supposed to be
listening for people.

33:04.974 --> 33:08.943
- You called them?
- You said it.

33:09.011 --> 33:11.712
We were running out
of time.

33:11.780 --> 33:14.582
You just didn't want
to get your hands dirty.

33:14.650 --> 33:16.984
Not this dirty.

33:17.052 --> 33:19.987
It's all right,
Rachel.

33:20.055 --> 33:21.288
Let's go, Nina.

33:21.356 --> 33:22.890
I'll stay with Rachel.
You go.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.692
Just go.

33:29.263 --> 33:31.164
Go! Move, move, move!

33:31.232 --> 33:33.233
All right.

33:33.301 --> 33:35.401
Watch the prisoner.

33:35.469 --> 33:39.705
Oh, my God.

33:39.773 --> 33:42.541
What the hell
did you people do?

33:50.116 --> 33:53.251
I cannot believe
Rosen screwed me again.

33:53.319 --> 33:55.820
I know.

33:55.888 --> 33:57.689
The glasses,
the messy hair,

33:57.757 --> 33:59.725
the cardigans, he seemed like
such a nice old dude.

33:59.792 --> 34:02.260
Please tell me that you got
something useful out of Scipio.

34:02.328 --> 34:04.229
Rosen said
he got what he needed

34:04.297 --> 34:06.598
whatever that is--
when Rachel--

34:06.666 --> 34:09.134
- Rachel was
on the phone with us.

34:09.202 --> 34:11.603
Tomorrow is
October 22nd, okay?

34:11.670 --> 34:13.906
We got a lot of work to do,
and we're losing time.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.007
We all have work
to do.

34:15.074 --> 34:16.208
We need to get
back to this office.

34:16.275 --> 34:17.242
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:17.310 --> 34:18.710
Them too?

34:18.777 --> 34:20.112
Harken, you saw
what they did in there.

34:20.179 --> 34:22.148
They went totally
medieval on him.

34:22.215 --> 34:24.317
She's right.
We lied to you.

34:24.385 --> 34:25.485
Yeah, you're a bunch
of lyin' asses,

34:25.553 --> 34:26.753
but you know what?

34:26.821 --> 34:28.522
I still need you.
Let's go.

34:34.161 --> 34:35.596
That's not too much
to ask, is it?

34:35.664 --> 34:37.565
All right?

34:37.632 --> 34:39.433
So please, go back to the office
and get it done.

34:39.501 --> 34:40.935
Hey!

34:41.002 --> 34:43.804
- Go with them. Thanks.
- Bill!

34:43.871 --> 34:44.705
- You got it.
- Gary, what's goin' on?

34:44.773 --> 34:45.806
Wait.
I found them!

34:45.873 --> 34:47.174
I know where
they are!

34:47.242 --> 34:48.809
- What, Hicks and Rosen?
- No, Skylar and Zoe.

34:48.876 --> 34:50.976
I know where they are,
but you have to pay Obuke.

34:51.045 --> 34:51.944
- Who--what?
- Obuke.

34:52.012 --> 34:53.045
He's the cab driver.

34:53.112 --> 34:54.679
He's from Nigeria.

34:54.748 --> 34:56.482
He's fiesty.
All right.

34:58.485 --> 34:59.785
Okay, Bill--
Bill, it's here!

34:59.853 --> 35:02.054
- All right, all right.
- It's here.

35:05.626 --> 35:07.527
Gary, where?

35:07.595 --> 35:08.862
Ohoh--

35:08.929 --> 35:10.664
Hey, hey, hey!

35:10.732 --> 35:11.865
Gary, stay in the car!
No, no!

35:11.933 --> 35:14.101
It's my rescue, Bill.
Come on.

35:14.169 --> 35:17.305
- Zoe!
- Easy, easy.

35:17.372 --> 35:20.041
Put your hands
where I can see 'em.

35:20.108 --> 35:21.142
Easy.

35:21.210 --> 35:22.410
E--

35:22.478 --> 35:24.445
- Oh--oh!
- Bill, I wanted to do that.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.215
Zoe!
Zoe!

35:27.283 --> 35:29.484
Hey, Gar--Gary.

35:29.552 --> 35:32.254
Cuff him.
Oh. Yeah.

35:34.056 --> 35:36.358
It's okay.
Easy, easy, easy.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.159
You're safe now, okay?

35:46.870 --> 35:50.439
You okay?

35:50.507 --> 35:53.976
Hold your arm.
You okay?

35:54.043 --> 35:55.811
This place is gross.

35:55.879 --> 35:58.380
Yeah, it is.

35:59.883 --> 36:02.318
Skylar, how did you
get in here?

36:02.386 --> 36:05.822
Parish.

36:05.890 --> 36:08.692
He asked me
to work for him.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.093
I told him
to go screw himself,

36:10.161 --> 36:14.298
and then we ended up
in this toilet with some...

36:18.504 --> 36:21.072
Scuzzball.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.876
Skylar, these look
like your designs.

36:24.944 --> 36:26.010
Were they having you
work on these

36:26.078 --> 36:28.146
in the twilight zone?

36:28.214 --> 36:29.982
Skylar, what were you
designing?

36:35.255 --> 36:37.457
The end of the world.

37:03.908 --> 37:07.576
Parish's been preparing
for a disaster.

37:07.578 --> 37:09.780
One of his own making.

37:35.173 --> 37:37.507
Parish is calling this
an adjustment center.

37:37.575 --> 37:39.509
An adjustment to what?

37:39.577 --> 37:40.877
Look, whatever he's planning,
he's planning

37:40.945 --> 37:43.180
to do it all over the place,
and look at this.

37:43.248 --> 37:45.883
Baltimore, Chicago.

37:47.786 --> 37:49.753
Oh, geez...Tyler.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.457
You've got to warn them.

37:53.525 --> 37:56.327
No, look, I'm not leaving
you here.

37:56.394 --> 37:58.395
Cameron, you need to get all
of this information to Bill

37:58.463 --> 38:01.799
right now.

38:01.866 --> 38:04.168
You have a family.
I don't.

38:04.235 --> 38:06.604
Now go.

38:11.243 --> 38:14.278
Look, okay,
take this.

38:14.346 --> 38:17.081
You take this.
You might need it, okay?

38:19.084 --> 38:21.519
- All right.
- I'll see you soon, huh?

38:21.587 --> 38:23.454
Yeah.

38:36.368 --> 38:38.737
I'm sorry, I should've warned
you about the conflict.

38:38.804 --> 38:40.472
It's just I didn't--
Look, if we're still

38:40.540 --> 38:41.840
alive in a day or two,
we'll talk about it.

38:41.908 --> 38:43.441
- John--
- No.

38:43.509 --> 38:45.711
This is one of the things
Parish made me build for him.

38:45.778 --> 38:47.846
It's a mini photostim.

38:47.914 --> 38:49.414
Oh, but there's
no light bulb.

38:49.482 --> 38:50.982
That--doesn't it
need a light bulb?

38:51.050 --> 38:53.051
Yeah, it has to be hooked up
to something

38:53.119 --> 38:56.655
like a lamp
or a computer screen.

38:56.722 --> 38:58.323
Power goes in.
Flashes come out.

38:58.391 --> 39:02.027
It's like--it's like
a Serotonin storm for the brain.

39:02.095 --> 39:04.296
Which can cause seizures like
the one that happened to me,

39:04.363 --> 39:07.332
but Skylar, it actually
boosted my Alpha ability

39:07.400 --> 39:08.600
and made everything better.
Oh, yeah,

39:08.668 --> 39:11.604
if you're an Alpha, sure.

39:11.671 --> 39:14.940
It's like steroids.
Okay, so increased ability,

39:15.008 --> 39:16.809
more control.
Well, that's cool.

39:16.877 --> 39:18.111
I-I want that.
- Yeah, except--

39:18.178 --> 39:20.113
- everyone should.
- Yeah, but what happens

39:20.181 --> 39:21.748
to people
who aren't Alphas?

39:21.816 --> 39:23.650
Mostly...

39:23.718 --> 39:26.353
They die.

39:26.421 --> 39:27.955
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

39:28.023 --> 39:30.558
So how many of these
were on that shipping container?

39:30.626 --> 39:32.026
Thousands?
Scipio said there

39:32.094 --> 39:34.529
were hundreds of shipments.
Hundreds of shipments?

39:34.597 --> 39:36.064
Yeah, and these are
much smaller than we thought,

39:36.132 --> 39:38.166
so there could
actually be millions.

39:38.234 --> 39:39.501
We're gonna start lookin'
for 'em now.

39:39.568 --> 39:40.869
Where the hell
have you been?

39:40.936 --> 39:42.237
- Where's Rosen?
- Why don't you have Rosen?

39:42.305 --> 39:44.873
- We went after Parish.
- What the hell do you mean...

39:44.940 --> 39:46.341
Yonkers, there's an old
National Guard Armory,

39:46.409 --> 39:49.210
and we found something--
just stop and listen to me!

39:49.278 --> 39:50.878
Whatever Parish
is planning on doing,

39:50.946 --> 39:53.314
he's planned
on doing it everywhere.

39:53.381 --> 39:55.249
So what?
You just leave Rosen there?

39:55.316 --> 39:56.483
- He wasn't done.
- Of course not.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.985
He's trying to take out Parish
on his own?

39:59.053 --> 40:01.321
We'll send some people
over there to deal with that.

40:01.389 --> 40:03.324
Millions of lives are at stake
because of this thing.

40:03.391 --> 40:05.125
This is what's important.

40:05.193 --> 40:08.129
This is what matters now.

40:08.196 --> 40:10.364
That's the last grid protector
for the day.

40:10.432 --> 40:11.832
Wanna grab a beer?

40:11.900 --> 40:14.435
Club tonight. I'd cancel,
but her royal highness

40:14.503 --> 40:17.238
would have a heart attack.
Another time.

40:23.412 --> 40:25.279
Mitchell.

40:25.347 --> 40:27.181
Dr. Rosen.

40:29.284 --> 40:30.885
Where's Parish?
Is he here?

40:30.952 --> 40:33.954
I have a plan
to change the world.

40:34.022 --> 40:37.825
It's just such a shame
that so many people have to die.

40:39.694 --> 40:42.230
He's given you his memories
again, hasn't he?

40:42.297 --> 40:45.333
I'm gonna watch the world
change with a God's eye view.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.768
What do you mean
God's eye view?

40:46.835 --> 40:50.171
Wh--wh--what is that?
What, in an airplane? What?

40:50.239 --> 40:52.840
I'm so hungry.
Do you have an apple?

40:52.908 --> 40:55.609
They used to grow apples
right around here.

41:02.883 --> 41:05.184
Listen, they're gonna be
coming for you.

41:05.252 --> 41:08.321
You need to hide somewhere
for two days.

41:08.397 --> 41:10.045
Two days.

41:53.523 --> 41:57.459
Hey, Dr. Rosen.

42:01.831 --> 42:03.632
Parish wants you alive.

42:03.700 --> 42:10.440
Me? Never really
saw the point.

42:16.514 --> 42:18.349
Adios, Doc.

42:21.119 --> 42:22.954
Oh, God.
