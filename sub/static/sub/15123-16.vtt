WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:06.674
There's no air
coming out her nose.

00:06.740 --> 00:07.341
She's really doing it.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.009
Hold your breath
all you want--

00:09.077 --> 00:11.679
the DMV is not gonna
give you back your
driver's license.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.547
Hey.
Bongo. Dibs.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.016
Ask... just ask me
to hand it to you.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.486
I'm going camping
for a few days.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.588
Sabrina's starting
an Occupy Natesville protest.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.091
Apparently, there is some
terrible stuff going on.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.325
But the good news is,

00:24.392 --> 00:26.060
it really isn't our
fault that we're poor.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.129
People didn't used to get
so mad at each other.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.563
And you know when it started?

00:29.630 --> 00:31.165
Right when Oprah
went off the air.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.633
That can't be a coincidence.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.103
Maw Maw's still
not cheating.
All I know is,

00:35.169 --> 00:37.471
protestors leave a mess.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.973
Doctors hate diseases,
cops hate robbers,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.376
and maids hate messes.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.945
Especially since Knock-Knock
does cleanup for street events.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.047
Which is why I despise parades

00:47.115 --> 00:48.682
and yelled those mean things

00:48.749 --> 00:50.418
when the pope
drove through town.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.320
I doubt he understands
curse words.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.521
Don't kid yourself.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.023
The pope understands
curse words just fine.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.391
Well, I'm going
to the protest,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.693
so I need you to
take care of Hope.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.296
VIRGINIA:
No way. I'm not
watching her and Maw Maw.

01:02.363 --> 01:03.564
How about I take Maw Maw?
Ooh.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.299
You want to go yell
at the government, Maw Maw?

01:05.366 --> 01:06.534
How's that sound?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.010
* Whoo! *

01:17.077 --> 01:19.780
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh *

01:19.847 --> 01:21.682
* Oh, oh, oh, oh! *

01:21.749 --> 01:23.684
I don't think we're getting
our message out there.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.986
Two moms just asked me
where to leave presents

01:26.053 --> 01:27.455
for the birthday party.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.924
The income redistribution
has begun!

01:30.991 --> 01:32.826
You people call this a protest?!

01:32.893 --> 01:35.196
We're not gonna get
our driver's licenses back

01:35.263 --> 01:38.199
if we don't get some attention!

01:38.266 --> 01:39.833
* *

01:42.403 --> 01:45.306
(crowd groans in disgust)

01:45.373 --> 01:49.009
Police say drivers
were distracted by this fire...

01:49.076 --> 01:51.712
which was caused
by an elderly woman

01:51.779 --> 01:53.614
setting her bra on fire.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.516
Fire department
officials postulate

01:55.583 --> 01:57.785
that the bra
was from an earlier era

01:57.851 --> 01:59.453
when they were much larger

01:59.520 --> 02:02.223
and made from
highly flammable foam material.

02:02.290 --> 02:05.259
I've forgotten what
I'm angry about!

02:05.326 --> 02:06.827
Her bras are old--
I washed one once

02:06.894 --> 02:09.730
and found a phone number in it
that only had four digits.

02:09.797 --> 02:10.864
To find out how

02:10.931 --> 02:12.966
the protest is affecting
nearby businesses,

02:13.033 --> 02:15.569
we spoke to Natesville
real estate developer

02:15.636 --> 02:18.806
and owner of the local mall,
Richard Galleria.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.574
This traffic is a nightmare.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.943
If people can't get
into the mall, they can't shop.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.446
If people can't shop,
then I have to tell

02:25.513 --> 02:28.216
the nice Asian woman who
works at the scrunchies kiosk,

02:28.282 --> 02:29.817
Sayonara...

02:29.883 --> 02:31.652
no mas trabajo.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.255
We also heard
from Mayor Hellmann.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.923
HELLMANN:
I want the protestors

02:35.989 --> 02:37.958
to know that I feel their pain.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.728
But I assure you
it is nowhere near as painful

02:40.794 --> 02:43.431
as pepper spray is
from point-blank range.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.665
(chuckling):
I got pepper-sprayed once.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.834
Shh. I want Hope
to see our woman mayor.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.203
Let's face it,
her mother was a serial killer,

02:49.270 --> 02:52.840
Maw Maw's a crazy old kook, and
I scrub toilets for a living.

02:52.906 --> 02:56.510
I want Hope to know
she can grow up to do
anything she wants.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.513
I don't like that
mayor-- she's too
much of a party girl.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.715
So she drinks on the
weekends-- who doesn't?

03:01.782 --> 03:03.817
Monday through Friday
she is all business.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.386
She got the library
moved indoors.

03:05.453 --> 03:07.288
She got the strip club
to put up drapes.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.189
And she almost got us

03:09.257 --> 03:11.058
that minor league
arena-football team.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.395
And you should enjoy
the experience of being the 99.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.597
That's a big number, 99.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.467
There was an Agent 99
in Get Smart.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.734
She was very smart.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.670
ALL:
We... are... the 99%!

03:22.736 --> 03:24.037
Hey!

03:24.104 --> 03:26.740
We... are... the 99%!

03:26.807 --> 03:30.778
Bring it on, you
jackbooted fascists!

03:30.844 --> 03:33.381
Yeah, you think just because
you got your shields

03:33.447 --> 03:36.917
and your little batons
and your little fire hoses

03:36.984 --> 03:38.986
and your rubber bullets
that can kill at close range...

03:39.052 --> 03:41.955
(laughs)
you think we're scared
of that stuff?

03:46.327 --> 03:48.128
That's fine.
We have people to spare.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.897
Now we got a core group
of martyrs.

03:49.963 --> 03:53.000
Natesville eight,
doing just great!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.635
I can't go to jail.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.470
I suffer from a shy bowel.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.672
It's cool. Just take off.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.074
Natesville seven,
protesting is heaven!

04:01.141 --> 04:02.310
I don't see
any German shepherds,

04:02.376 --> 04:04.312
but I'd just as soon
not risk it.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.348
Natesville six,
getting rid... What?

04:07.415 --> 04:08.949
I can't lose
my day care license.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.084
Plus all the cute black guys
are gone.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.386
Okay, fine. Just leave.

04:12.453 --> 04:16.957
Natesville five,
we're still alive!

04:17.024 --> 04:19.427
Well, there's five of us
and five of them.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.962
I don't like these odds.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.764
Let's call in the auxiliary.

04:23.831 --> 04:24.565
(phone rings)

04:24.632 --> 04:26.634
Ooh. I just got a text
calling me in

04:26.700 --> 04:29.370
for my auxiliary police post.
Well, good luck.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.539
I'll try not to pepper spray
your eyes.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.542
I can't risk going to jail.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.644
From behind,
all you can see is

04:36.710 --> 04:38.646
my long hair
and childbearing hips

04:38.712 --> 04:39.680
Okay.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.782
I know this is about
Hope's future,

04:41.849 --> 04:43.317
but I'm worried
about the future

04:43.384 --> 04:44.818
of who's gonna change
her diapers tonight.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.887
Go.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.327
All right, let's put on a good
show for the TV cameras.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.428
All right, obviously

04:54.495 --> 04:56.464
the old lady is not
in her right mind.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.433
So, let's do
the humanitarian thing, boys,

04:59.500 --> 05:01.234
and just drop her off
at her home.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.671
But this one, this one
needs to be taught

05:03.737 --> 05:06.507
the definition
of law and order!

05:06.574 --> 05:09.410
(quietly):
Hey, psst,

05:09.477 --> 05:10.644
let me just put
the handcuffs on you

05:10.711 --> 05:12.446
and then I'll take you around
the corner and let you go.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.081
I want to be arrested!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.984
Our cause gets more attention
from a jail cell!

05:17.050 --> 05:18.686
I'm not gonna fill out paperwork
all night

05:18.752 --> 05:20.621
and miss a new episode
of Burn Notice

05:20.688 --> 05:23.357
just to arrest somebody
for a peaceful protest.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.925
(sighs)

05:27.127 --> 05:28.962
(yells)

05:29.029 --> 05:31.799
(laughing maniacally)

05:31.865 --> 05:33.834
Right on.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.306
No bail?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.474
Two weeks until
your hearing?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.075
This isn't fair.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.310
I know, but listen,

05:43.377 --> 05:44.945
they're just trying to make
an example of me, you know?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.515
It's just gonna give
more attention for my cause.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.882
Nobody would have known
who Nelson Mandela was

05:48.949 --> 05:52.119
if he hadn't been in jail
for 20 years.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.521
Mandela?

05:53.587 --> 05:56.356
The bald guy from
Deal or No Deal?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.324
Never mind.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.159
I'm gonna miss you.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.429
I know.
I'm gonna miss you, too.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.064
I smuggled my phone in here,

06:04.131 --> 06:05.533
so you can call me
whenever you want.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.401
I got it on vibrate.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.738
(phone vibrates, Sabrina moans)

06:10.804 --> 06:13.006
Sorry. I just got a text.

06:14.608 --> 06:17.244
Apparently, the press conference
with Mayor Hellmann

06:17.310 --> 06:20.013
and local businessman Richard
Galleria has been delayed,

06:20.080 --> 06:23.350
so we're gonna send you back to
your regularly scheduled episode

06:23.417 --> 06:25.586
of Gina Loves Horses.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.858
(laughs)
I can't believe

06:30.924 --> 06:34.227
all the cool stuff the
hippies left behind.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.529
Burt, this isn't
a scavenger hunt.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.765
I thought you came down here
to help me clean up.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.300
Look, a Simpsons chess set!

06:40.367 --> 06:42.169
Man, it's gotta
be a collector's item.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.171
You don't see a lot
of Simpsons merchandise.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.773
Five...

06:45.839 --> 06:48.075
Please tell me we
are not responsible

06:48.141 --> 06:49.943
for getting rid of
that abandoned car.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.845
At your park, that would be
an abandoned car.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.181
At our park,
it's a jungle gym.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.783
This is your park?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.818
No jungle gym, no sandbox?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.987
You're thinking
of the white people's park.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.822
Everything's great
at the white people's park.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.657
The ice cream guy sells
ice cream

07:03.724 --> 07:05.292
at the white people's park.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.527
You know, they don't call it

07:06.594 --> 07:07.861
"The White People's Park"
anymore.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.697
They changed the name
back in the '60s.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.034
(buzzer sounds)

07:16.570 --> 07:18.305
Oh, my God.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.008
Sabrina Collins?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.242
It's me, Rikki!

07:22.309 --> 07:24.211
Rikki Hargrove?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.846
No. Nothing.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.948
Okay, well,
Little Beavers?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.951
Lodge number 586?

07:32.119 --> 07:33.987
Rikki!

07:34.955 --> 07:35.489
Rikki!

07:35.556 --> 07:37.525
Oh, God, of course!

07:37.591 --> 07:39.860
(both laughing)

07:39.927 --> 07:42.095
You know, it's just so great
to see a friendly face.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.698
I've only been here
two days and I'm already

07:44.765 --> 07:46.767
cold, lonely and starving.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.202
You know what else is cold
and lonely and starving?

07:49.269 --> 07:50.203
My heart.

07:50.270 --> 07:54.307
Ever since my BFF in
sixth grade dumped me

07:54.374 --> 07:55.776
to become popular.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.345
No! See, the thing is,
I just, I got...

07:58.411 --> 08:00.581
I got busy with cheerleading,

08:00.648 --> 08:02.349
and you know,
you had scouting,

08:02.415 --> 08:03.517
but I totally didn't dump you.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.918
(gasps):
Oh!

08:04.985 --> 08:08.355
Like I didn't just dump
your food onto the floor.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.991
Look, I'm really sorry.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.527
I swear, I really never meant
to hurt you.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.428
In fact, you know,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.030
the years of scouting
were some

08:17.097 --> 08:19.833
of the-the best memories
of-of-of my life.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.101
Really?

08:21.168 --> 08:23.436
Mm-hmm.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.305
Well, we can relive
all of them

08:25.372 --> 08:26.506
these next two weeks.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.708
And all those
badges you missed?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.209
You can earn them.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.612
Do you remember the Little
Beaver's marching song?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.881
Of course.
Okay.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.149
Oh, I meant
of course not.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.619
But, you know,
it's gonna come back to me.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.253
(sniffs)
Okay.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.189
Well, when it does,

08:42.255 --> 08:46.760
your pillow and your blanket
will come back to you.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.166
Morning.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.737
See? That's what I mean.

08:56.804 --> 08:58.706
People are too busy to be
friendly these days.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.640
(woman sobbing)

08:59.707 --> 09:01.541
MAN:
Get yourself together!

09:01.609 --> 09:03.310
It was a onetime fling
at a Christmas party.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.445
There shouldn't be
any drama.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.880
You're supposed
to be the mayor.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.481
You're acting
like a child.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.652
You can't dictate
my emotions, Richard!

09:11.719 --> 09:13.486
It's not even lunch,
and you are drunk!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.455
I am not drunk.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.390
If I were drunk,
would I be able

09:17.457 --> 09:18.759
to touch my finger
to your nose?

09:18.826 --> 09:20.293
Ow!
Oh!

09:20.360 --> 09:22.229
I'm sorry.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.864
Now, look, the press
conference is starting.

09:23.931 --> 09:27.300
I'll stall them, you
straighten yourself up.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.976
What's up?

09:36.043 --> 09:38.245
Another guy too busy
for pleasantries.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.579
Watch the door.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.348
I'm gonna go help her
collect herself.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.991
You may wonder why the mayor
appears tearful and wobbly.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.093
It's my fault.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.862
I was cleaning the ladies' room
when the mayor walked in,

09:54.928 --> 09:57.798
and I had been
experimenting with

09:57.865 --> 10:00.033
a little homemade
floor wax,

10:00.100 --> 10:01.669
and unfortunately, one
of the main ingredients

10:01.735 --> 10:03.003
is banana peels and...

10:03.070 --> 10:04.738
Anyway, you get the picture.
No more questions.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.707
Is she...?

10:06.774 --> 10:08.608
No further statement
at this time.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.947
Ever since I bummed a smoke
from one of those hippies

10:14.014 --> 10:17.651
at the demonstration, I have
been absolutely starving.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.687
Do we have any cake icing?

10:20.688 --> 10:23.090
(doorbell rings)

10:26.159 --> 10:27.094
Oh, my God!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.395
Mayor Suzie,

10:28.461 --> 10:31.098
please come in.
Burt, um, go find the camera.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.767
Listen, Virginia,
it was so wonderful

10:33.834 --> 10:35.769
what you did for me
this morning.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.905
I just want to know
how I can repay you.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.873
Hold on.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.409
Let me make sure
I'm hearing this right.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.877
Are you granting us a wish?

10:43.944 --> 10:47.147
I guess if you want,
you can call it that.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.148
Oh, yes, I do.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.983
I want very much
to call it that.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.785
It's been my dream
my entire life

10:51.852 --> 10:53.386
to find a genie
or a magic lamp

10:53.453 --> 10:56.389
or catch a leprechaun and
be granted three wishes.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.291
Oh, well, I only actually said
one wish.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.694
Oh, yeah, I heard you,
but traditionally,

11:00.761 --> 11:02.295
when people are out
granting wishes...

11:02.362 --> 11:03.396
Well, I'm not a genie.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.632
Okay, then I would like a stop
sign in front of my house.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.634
Hey. Uh, Burt, hang on a second.

11:07.701 --> 11:08.869
(whispering):
Excuse me.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.072
Maybe we should do something
good for the community.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.774
This is for the community.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.176
When people slow down and stop,
we'll stand out front and wave.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.778
Bring a little friendliness
to this town.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.813
I think we should use our wish

11:19.880 --> 11:21.882
to get proper play equipment
in Rosa's park.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.851
We could even call it that.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.853
"Rosa's Park." Sounds catchy.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.156
Wait, wait. I got it.

11:31.258 --> 11:32.659
Uh...

11:32.726 --> 11:36.163
we would like to use our wish
to get three more wishes.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.464
Fine.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.732
I can do three things,

11:38.799 --> 11:41.201
especially since those
first two are very easy.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.970
Guys! Guys,
you gotta come in the kitchen.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.505
There's an old lady living
in the side of our toaster,

11:45.572 --> 11:46.774
and her face is all...

11:46.840 --> 11:49.209
(makes gurgling noises)

11:52.679 --> 11:54.581
Wait a second.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.416
I'm high, aren't I?

12:01.588 --> 12:04.357
Lyrics to the Little Beaver's
marching song.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.359
Nice try.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.428
And don't try and quote
them over the phone,

12:08.495 --> 12:09.362
'cause I'll be listening.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.103
(chokes)

12:16.169 --> 12:18.105
I think I just swallowed
the second verse.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.173
(coughs)

12:23.410 --> 12:24.377
Crap.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.246
It's fine. Trust me.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.087
The second verse
is on her bum.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.990
But, uh, hurry up, 'cause
she hasn't gone in a while.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.663
Hi, neighbor.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.998
We're the Chances.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.800
Taking advantage
of our stop sign

12:46.867 --> 12:48.335
to add a little friendliness
to our community

12:48.401 --> 12:49.636
and say hi to folks.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.038
Hi.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.272
Hi.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.110
Okay.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.681
Well, I am sold.

13:01.748 --> 13:02.682
I know, right?

13:02.749 --> 13:05.285
(phone rings)

13:06.353 --> 13:07.654
Yellow.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.688
You were right.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.790
They put in a play
structure at our park.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.160
Now you don't have to
be white to slide.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.627
Yay!

13:14.694 --> 13:16.363
They're loving
the play equipment.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.764
It's fun pulling
the strings of government.

13:17.831 --> 13:20.200
I can see why
rich people like it.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.734
What's with
the stop sign?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.003
We got three wishes

13:23.070 --> 13:25.338
from the mayor and we wished
for this stop sign

13:25.405 --> 13:27.040
and Rosa's Park.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.909
We're still trying
to decide on wish three.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.610
You have a wish credit
from the mayor

13:30.677 --> 13:32.745
and you aren't getting
Sabrina out of jail?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.214
She's being tortured.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.782
Didn't it get better when you
brought her the song?

13:35.849 --> 13:38.518
No, it just got worse.

13:38.585 --> 13:42.289
* A little beaver marches
without fear *

13:42.355 --> 13:47.294
* A beaver's always
in the front and not the rear *

13:47.360 --> 13:49.562
* When a beaver's
lost and cold *

13:49.629 --> 13:52.232
* She warms up
by rubbing sticks *

13:52.299 --> 13:54.434
* I'll never give up because *

13:54.501 --> 13:59.472
* A little beaver
can't be licked. *

13:59.539 --> 14:00.707
Fine.

14:00.773 --> 14:02.542
You got your singing badge.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.578
And luckily for you,
I kept your uniform.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.214
(sniffs deeply)

14:07.280 --> 14:08.615
What...?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.583
Now put it on.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.718
(grunts)
God...

14:11.784 --> 14:14.087
Now, it's time to sell

14:14.154 --> 14:17.257
some cookies and get your
small business Beaver badge.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.326
Where am I supposed
to sell cookies?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.929
(whoops, catcalls)

14:21.995 --> 14:23.763
Howdy!
(laughs)

14:23.830 --> 14:25.032
Good luck.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.300
These guys
haven't seen cookies

14:27.367 --> 14:32.105
or the Little Beavers
in a long time.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.573
Fine, take wish three.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.508
But I don't think the mayor's
gonna know who you are,

14:35.575 --> 14:37.978
so you should probably wear that
T-shirt we got at the carnival

14:38.045 --> 14:39.812
with the family photo
ironed on it.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.581
(tearful):
Oh...

14:41.648 --> 14:44.952
Why can't we just
go away for the weekend?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.954
I can't really talk right now,
but I'm not going away with you.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.656
You need to move on.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.558
I'll move on.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.526
And when I do move on,

14:53.593 --> 14:57.430
you are gonna be so jealous
that you're gonna want me back.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.767
Uh, Mrs. Mayor? I'm, uh,
I'm Virginia Chance's son.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.769
Oh, you may not remember.

15:02.835 --> 15:05.738
She's the cowboy prostitute,
and I'm the prospector,

15:05.805 --> 15:07.340
uh, right here.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.076
Really?

15:09.142 --> 15:11.378
Virginia didn't tell me
she had such a cute son.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.146
Well, that's because
she doesn't think I'm very cute.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.381
Oh...
Anyway, um,

15:14.447 --> 15:16.383
my parents said I could use
their third wish.
Oh.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.186
It's all... it's all there
in my mom's note.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.387
Oh.

15:21.721 --> 15:25.558
Well, if you were gonna
wish for chiseled pecs,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.028
you're too late, because
you already got 'em.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.229
(chuckles nervously)

15:29.296 --> 15:32.499
Uh, actually,
my girlfriend was put in jail

15:32.565 --> 15:36.069
for the whole Occupy
misunderstanding.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.971
I'm sure she's moved on.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.508
Yeah. There's a lot of
sex in our jails.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.776
We should go out.
Look, I'm very flattered,

15:43.843 --> 15:45.545
but I don't think I could
do that to my girlfriend.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.281
Let me just get this straight.

15:48.348 --> 15:51.118
You're rejecting me?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.120
Is that right?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.088
'Cause let me
tell you something:

15:55.155 --> 15:57.257
I would be a real
catch for you,

15:57.324 --> 15:58.791
even if I wasn't the mayor.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.760
Don't think of it as rejection.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.395
It is rejection,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.696
but that seems
to be upsetting you,

16:03.763 --> 16:05.698
so maybe try to think of it
in a different way.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.734
You know what? How about
I think about it like this?

16:07.800 --> 16:08.868
Get the hell out of my office!

16:08.935 --> 16:11.504
Hi. We're the...

16:11.571 --> 16:13.906
Just want to say hello.

16:13.973 --> 16:14.841
Hi, just want to say...

16:14.907 --> 16:16.076
Can you believe this?!

16:16.143 --> 16:17.410
I don't know what's going on!

16:17.477 --> 16:19.979
No way, Rosa.
Are you serious?

16:20.047 --> 16:22.449
They're taking everything.
What happened?

16:22.515 --> 16:24.684
Wait. I got another
call. Hold on.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.585
Hello?

16:25.652 --> 16:27.020
SABRINA:
Can you tell Jimmy to hurry up?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.855
This place is a nightmare.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.357
(sighs)

16:30.423 --> 16:31.524
All right!

16:31.591 --> 16:32.892
Take it easy,
there's enough for everybody,

16:32.959 --> 16:34.394
but it would really
help me out

16:34.461 --> 16:35.528
if I could have
exact cigarettes.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.265
What the hell did you do?

16:38.331 --> 16:39.632
Mayor Hellman wanted
to go on a date

16:39.699 --> 16:41.201
and I said I couldn't
do that to Sabrina.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.738
I'll need you to move
those vehicles later.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.907
Got a job to put a hydrant here.
In the middle of our driveway?

16:47.974 --> 16:50.777
Yeah. This whole area's gonna
be a no parking zone.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.245
By orders of the mayor.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.847
Hey, neighborhood
committee of friendship...

16:54.914 --> 16:56.083
(yells in frustration)

16:59.786 --> 17:01.354
Well, I'm sorry
I've had you on the phone

17:01.421 --> 17:03.923
for two an a half hours,
but there's a fire hydrant

17:03.990 --> 17:06.359
right in the middle
of my driveway.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.696
And I have better things to do
than talk on the phone, also.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.264
You know, fine. Fine.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.732
I'll call someone else.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.803
Well, my mother wasn't any help.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.171
Look.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.740
Since the actual police
are busy gathering evidence,

17:20.807 --> 17:24.911
we are here live with auxiliary
officer Barney Hughes

17:24.977 --> 17:26.679
in front of real estate
developer

17:26.746 --> 17:28.115
Richard Galleria's home.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.117
What happened, Officer Hughes?

17:30.183 --> 17:33.520
Well, uh, earlier tonight
a brick was thrown

17:33.586 --> 17:35.688
through Mr. Galleria's
front window.

17:35.755 --> 17:38.491
Now, we have some surveillance
footage from the home

17:38.558 --> 17:41.394
that shows a female vandal
matching the description

17:41.461 --> 17:43.530
of Mayor Hellmann getting into
what I heard the real cops

17:43.596 --> 17:45.698
confirming to be
the mayor's car.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.467
REPORTER:
Mmm.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.937
Is that an
actual uniform?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.373
Uh, no, I, uh...
made it myself.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.507
Wow.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.544
Whoa. You still think
she's a good role model?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.078
My write-in vote
for Chocolate Rain Guy

17:59.146 --> 18:00.747
doesn't look so stupid now,
does it?

18:00.813 --> 18:01.714
(phone rings)

18:02.649 --> 18:04.684
Hello?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.487
(whispering):
Virginia.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.156
I am so screwed.

18:09.222 --> 18:10.290
You gotta help me.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.591
Oh, you want my help now?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.226
Well, why would I want
to help a...

18:13.293 --> 18:14.727
VIRGINIA:
Life can be frustrating,

18:14.794 --> 18:16.663
especially when the people
with all the power,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.132
the kings of the jungle,
don't deserve it.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.534
REPORTER:
We've just entered minute 15
of this car chase

18:21.601 --> 18:23.903
between the Natesville Police
and a driver

18:23.970 --> 18:26.506
we believe to be
Mayor Hellmann.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.441
The regular people,
the little mice,

18:28.508 --> 18:32.212
have to sit back and watch
the lions rule the world.

18:32.279 --> 18:36.449
But every once in a while, the
lion gets a thorn in their paw,

18:36.516 --> 18:38.851
and the little mouse
is the only one who can help.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.790
Some mice like to just sit back
and laugh at the lion,

18:43.856 --> 18:46.693
but not the smart mouse.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.296
Ooh, ooh. Get a picture
of me arresting the mayor.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
I want to make it
my profile pic.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.266
VIRGINIA:
The smart mouse
pulls out the thorn

18:53.333 --> 18:55.635
and ends up with all the power.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.404
(laughs)
Whoa.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.739
Who thought it was safe
to let me drive?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.708
(laughing)

19:01.774 --> 19:03.009
REPORTER:
Apparently, the elderly woman

19:03.075 --> 19:05.845
took her protest to a new level
by stealing the mayor's car.

19:08.648 --> 19:12.151
Thank you so much
for saving me from jail.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.920
Oh...

19:13.986 --> 19:14.854
I'll do whatever you want.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.989
Even if you want me to resign.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.192
Resign? Why would you resign?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.660
You're a great mayor.

19:21.861 --> 19:22.895
You really think that?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.364
Yes!

19:24.431 --> 19:26.032
You lowered taxes.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.767
And you tested the water

19:27.834 --> 19:29.636
in the reservoir, and then
you shut down the reservoir.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.039
And you put speed bumps
in the bike lanes

19:33.105 --> 19:34.607
to slow those jerks down.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.008
Yeah.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.710
But you're a mess as a person,

19:37.777 --> 19:38.745
and that's gotta change

19:38.811 --> 19:40.813
so that you can become
a good role model

19:40.880 --> 19:42.349
for the little girls
of this town.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.616
You've got to get
rid of this guy

19:43.683 --> 19:45.151
who's making you mess up
your life

19:45.218 --> 19:47.920
just 'cause he's too stupid
to know how great you are.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.557
You're right.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.392
Thanks.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.661
(clears throat)

19:54.727 --> 19:58.665
So, uh, your son,
is he serious about this girl?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.033
I'm joking.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.936
(both laughing)

20:06.138 --> 20:08.007
(sighs)

20:08.074 --> 20:11.978
Everything good
with you and Burt?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.946
(clears throat)

20:17.417 --> 20:19.686
VIRGINIA:
So as soon as I got the power,

20:19.752 --> 20:23.122
I used it to help out
regular people.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.757
I got Sabrina out of jail...

20:24.824 --> 20:26.359
The truth is,

20:26.426 --> 20:28.428
I still don't
remember her.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.033
Sheila Martinez?

20:34.100 --> 20:36.303
it's me, Rikki.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.771
Rikki Hargrove, from scouting?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.440
Little Beavers.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.776
Rikki!

20:43.843 --> 20:46.245
...I got our stop sign back,
so regular people

20:46.313 --> 20:47.680
could get to know each other...

20:47.747 --> 20:48.748
Hey, Burt.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.149
Can you help me?
I think I'm lost.

20:50.216 --> 20:53.386
I was supposed to make a right
after the second stop sign,

20:53.453 --> 20:55.488
but if I make a right
at this stop sign,

20:55.555 --> 20:57.023
I'm gonna be in your driveway.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.325
What kind of pizza you got?

20:58.391 --> 20:59.992
Extra pepperoni.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.261
Well, pull on in, neighbor!

21:02.329 --> 21:05.131
...then I made her re-fix up
the poor people's park.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.668
I did this all
for you, baby.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.703
'Cause I want you to
know that the mayor

21:10.770 --> 21:13.840
is the most powerful
woman in this town.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.142
And she has to do
whatever I tell her to.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.077
You know what that makes me?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.812
The most-est
powerful woman.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.681
(giggles)

21:21.748 --> 21:23.416
Let's go play
on the new stuff.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.884
But we're gonna let the
Mexican kids go first,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.986
'cause they've been
waiting a while.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.831
Katy Perry is a babe.
