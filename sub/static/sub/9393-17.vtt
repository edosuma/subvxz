00:06.383 --> 00:08.284
It was awfully nice of our
new neighbors

00:08.318 --> 00:09.785
to invite us
over for dinner.

00:09.820 --> 00:10.720
I don't know, Lois.

00:10.754 --> 00:11.988
Going to
Cleveland's house

00:12.022 --> 00:13.606
with someone else
living there just seems weird.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.292
Like when a new Pope
moves into the Vatican.

00:16.326 --> 00:18.260
Hi, I don't know
who to complain to about this,

00:18.295 --> 00:21.297
but I'm still getting
XVIII's mail.

00:21.331 --> 00:22.531
Yeah, no.

00:22.566 --> 00:25.067
No, he's not here anymore,
this is XXIV.

00:25.102 --> 00:26.902
Yeah, no, I don't need
<i>Newsweek.</i>

00:26.937 --> 00:29.238
No, I don't need
<i>National Geographic.</i>

00:29.272 --> 00:32.540
Oh yeah, no, yeah, we'll-we'll
hang on to <i>Boys' Life.</i>

00:33.577 --> 00:35.461
Hello, neighbors.

00:35.495 --> 00:36.996
Joe, you can walk.

00:37.030 --> 00:37.997
How do you do?

00:38.031 --> 00:39.031
I'm Stan Smith.

00:39.066 --> 00:40.182
Please, come in.

00:42.352 --> 00:45.021
Oh, I'm so glad
everyone could make it.

00:45.055 --> 00:46.455
Stan, I need $50.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.925
They're selling a biopsy of
Celine Dion's uterus on eBay.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.394
What the hell
kind of dog is that?

00:51.428 --> 00:53.629
I was going to
ask the same thing.

00:53.663 --> 00:55.581
Oh, uh, that's
our alien, Roger.

00:55.615 --> 00:57.533
He lives in our attic,
but nobody can know.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.719
And don't tell
anybody about our attic.

00:59.753 --> 01:00.720
(phone ringing)

01:00.754 --> 01:01.721
Hello?

01:01.755 --> 01:02.855
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

01:02.889 --> 01:04.272
Hey, you're not gonna
believe this.

01:04.307 --> 01:06.459
I'm over here with Joe,
and he's got a space alien.

01:07.644 --> 01:09.161
(all screaming)

01:09.196 --> 01:11.230
(moaning)

01:13.333 --> 01:14.316
Peter, wake up.

01:14.351 --> 01:15.751
You're having
a nightmare.

01:15.786 --> 01:16.752
(gasps)

01:16.787 --> 01:17.753
Oh, Lois.

01:17.788 --> 01:19.438
Thank God,
it was just a dream.

01:19.473 --> 01:20.589
Hey.

01:20.624 --> 01:22.992
Lois, what's that
fat man doing in our bed?

01:23.026 --> 01:26.162
Ugh, damn it,
I always wake up

01:26.196 --> 01:29.231
before I find out if they can
understand the baby.

02:07.521 --> 02:09.588
Lois says Stewie's been
getting a little chunky.

02:09.622 --> 02:12.274
Ugh, everybody's
always commenting on my weight.

02:12.309 --> 02:14.560
This is why
I almost died from anorexia.

look...

02:21.334 --> 02:23.469
All right, I got the
monkey bars all put together.

02:23.503 --> 02:24.720
Aw, God,
look at that,

02:24.754 --> 02:26.439
they already got
Al Qaedas all over them.

out of here.

02:27.674 --> 02:28.874

Man, they're gonna be so good

02:30.527 --> 02:32.478
at swinging bar-to-bar,
when they invade.

02:32.512 --> 02:35.464
Wow, Quagmire, how did you
build that part so fast?

02:35.499 --> 02:36.532
It was easy.

02:36.566 --> 02:37.716
I just followed
the instructions.

02:37.767 --> 02:39.047
I couldn't find
the English ones.

02:39.052 --> 02:40.603
These are in Latin
and those stuffy

02:40.637 --> 02:42.471

won't help me.

02:50.831 --> 02:52.014
No, I just read the back,

02:52.032 --> 02:53.065
where it's printed in French.

02:53.116 --> 02:54.416
You speak French?

comes in handy

03:16.089 --> 03:17.690
when I have layovers
in Montreal.

03:17.724 --> 03:18.958
That place is the best.

03:18.992 --> 03:20.659
I always wanted to go
to Canada,

03:20.694 --> 03:22.678
but then <i>South Park</i> went,
so we couldn't go.

03:22.712 --> 03:24.563
Oh, man, you guys should
come with me sometime.

03:24.598 --> 03:26.439
Montreal has the best
strip clubs in the world.

03:26.466 --> 03:27.449
They do?

03:27.484 --> 03:28.684
Yeah, they're unbelievable.

03:28.718 --> 03:30.553
The girls
up in Canada are gorgeous.

03:30.587 --> 03:31.770
And they
all play ice hockey,

03:31.805 --> 03:33.422
so they lose
their teeth by age ten.

03:33.456 --> 03:34.623
Wow.

03:34.658 --> 03:36.425
In fact,
I'd even go so far as to say

03:36.459 --> 03:37.693
that a Canadian strip club

All right,
let's do it!

04:34.050 --> 04:35.210

lie about where we're going.

04:36.353 --> 04:37.836
Okay, sure.
Yeah, no problem.

04:37.887 --> 04:39.004
I'm a great liar.

04:41.391 --> 04:42.891
Okay, we're
good this way.

04:42.926 --> 04:44.426
Is it clear
in your direction?

04:46.730 --> 04:48.113
Yep.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.888

you get the answer wrong,

you get
stabbed in the butt.

04:57.157 --> 04:59.458
All right, Bradley,
here's your question.

04:59.492 --> 05:02.061
What is the
atomic weight of nitrogen?

05:03.863 --> 05:04.663
Get him, guys!

05:04.698 --> 05:06.031

05:06.082 --> 05:07.533
Okay,
bye, you guys.

05:07.567 --> 05:08.801
I'm leaving now.

05:08.835 --> 05:11.036
Peter, tell me again
why you're going to Montreal?

05:11.071 --> 05:12.788
Hey, do I give you
the third degree

05:12.822 --> 05:15.291
every time you go for one of
those luxurious mammograms?

05:15.325 --> 05:17.259
Dad, why can't we all go?

05:17.294 --> 05:18.661
Because somebody's
got to stay here

05:18.695 --> 05:19.995
and round up all

Hey, guys.

05:28.888 --> 05:30.472

What do you think?

05:30.506 --> 05:31.724
Wow, a private plane?

05:31.775 --> 05:33.292
How'd you swing
that, Quagmire?

05:33.326 --> 05:35.628
Well, let's just say
I walked in on John Travolta

05:35.662 --> 05:37.296
with not Kelly Preston.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.265
Oh, my God,
this plane is awesome, Quagmire.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.667
Hey, who's that?

05:41.701 --> 05:43.435
Oh, that's
J. Private Planington.

05:43.470 --> 05:44.903
He invented
private planes.

05:44.938 --> 05:47.306
He was also the world's
foremost squid hunter.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.942
I've got a lot of big
ideas, too,

05:49.976 --> 05:51.477
but everybody's
just so jealous.

05:53.530 --> 05:55.364
Boy, this is nice.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.116
Hey, Joe, I'm gonna
go check out the john.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.103
Oh, my God,
have you seen this?

06:01.137 --> 06:02.671
Look how fancy this thing is.

06:02.706 --> 06:04.690
They even got a special map
that lets you choose

06:04.724 --> 06:06.358
who you wan to dump
your poop on.

06:08.061 --> 06:10.629
Geez, the synagogue
button's almost worn out.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.101
Oh, my God, Joe,
there's a man on the wing.

06:16.152 --> 06:17.736
Peter, there's
no man on the wing.

06:17.771 --> 06:18.971
There is! I saw him!

06:19.005 --> 06:20.673
Peter, stop
being ridiculous.

06:20.707 --> 06:21.907
I'm telling you,
lift up the shade.

06:21.941 --> 06:22.841
There's a man on the wing.

06:22.876 --> 06:24.710
(sighs) Fine.

06:24.744 --> 06:25.778
It's me.

06:25.812 --> 06:26.945
I'm the
man on the wing.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.714
Peter, how the hell
did you get out there?

06:28.748 --> 06:30.032
Are you crazy?!

06:30.066 --> 06:31.500
Get back
in here, Peter!

06:32.736 --> 06:34.269
What the hell's going on
back there?

06:34.304 --> 06:35.304
We're losing altitude.

06:37.874 --> 06:39.408
Hang on, you guys;
I don't know

06:39.442 --> 06:40.909
if I can pull out
of this-- giggity!

06:40.944 --> 06:42.845
Wow, from up here,
everything looks

06:42.879 --> 06:44.546
so huge and coming faster.

06:58.228 --> 07:00.662
Uh, what happened?

07:00.697 --> 07:01.830
Did we crash?

07:01.865 --> 07:03.399
Yeah, we crashed.

07:03.433 --> 07:04.600
Wow.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.402
Still, you know,
we saved so much trouble

07:06.436 --> 07:08.370
not flying commercial,
I think we came out ahead.

07:08.405 --> 07:09.538
Sure.

07:09.572 --> 07:11.106
Drive right up to the plane.
Exactly.

07:11.141 --> 07:13.142
If we went to Logan,
that plane wouldn't crash

07:13.176 --> 07:14.443
for another hour,
at least.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.147
Oh, they made
pretty good time.

07:24.515 --> 07:25.874
(sighs) I'm bored.

07:25.875 --> 07:28.043
Peter, you made me crash
the damn plane!

07:28.077 --> 07:29.711
Okay, I know you're a
pilot and everything,

07:29.746 --> 07:31.580
but not everyone
likes to talk about planes

07:31.614 --> 07:33.015
as much as you, Quagmire.

07:34.083 --> 07:35.851
Well, we're out
of cell phone range

07:35.885 --> 07:36.725
and the radio's shot.

07:36.753 --> 07:37.853
This is not good.

07:37.887 --> 07:39.021
No one knows
we're out here,

07:39.055 --> 07:40.656
and we've got
no food or water.

07:40.690 --> 07:42.591
Relax, Quagmire,
there's food all around us.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.859
The trick is just knowing

07:43.893 --> 07:45.494
what's safe to eat
and what's not.

07:50.533 --> 07:51.867
Okay, these are a "maybe."

07:51.901 --> 07:53.719
You guys, I think,
for the time being,

07:53.753 --> 07:56.021
we're gonna have to start
thinking in terms of survival.

07:56.055 --> 07:57.489
Yeah, we're just
gonna have to do

07:57.523 --> 07:58.824
what Davy Crockett
would do.

07:58.858 --> 08:01.009
I mean, that guy killed a
bear when he was only three.

08:01.077 --> 08:02.778
Honey, don't you
think it's weird

08:02.812 --> 08:03.979
that our
three-year-old son

08:04.013 --> 08:05.113
is murdering animals?

08:05.148 --> 08:06.215
Nonsense.

08:06.249 --> 08:07.699
He's a healthy,
normal young boy.

08:07.733 --> 08:10.869
Ma, Pa, I
killed my pet raccoon.

08:10.903 --> 08:12.521
Why, Davy?

08:12.555 --> 08:14.022
So I could
have this cool hat

08:14.057 --> 08:16.592
and 'cause it felt like
heaven when I was doing it.

08:22.565 --> 08:23.966
Well, it's getting dark.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.467
We should
probably start a fire.

08:25.501 --> 08:26.702
Man, how do
we do that?

08:26.736 --> 08:28.086
Hey, do you think
there's directions

08:28.121 --> 08:29.721
about starting
fires in the song

08:29.756 --> 08:30.956
"We Didn't
Start the Fire"?

08:30.990 --> 08:31.957
I don't think so.

08:31.991 --> 08:33.191
I better go
through it all.

08:33.226 --> 08:34.960
♪ Stuff, stuff,
stuff and stuff ♪

08:34.994 --> 08:36.595
♪ History and stuff and stuff

08:51.778 --> 08:53.111
Okay, how's
the fire coming?

08:53.146 --> 08:54.306
(frogs croaking, owl hooting)

08:56.582 --> 08:58.033
Okay, this should work.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.434
If it rains, at least
we know we can stay dry.

08:59.469 --> 09:00.435
Yeah.

09:00.470 --> 09:01.737
So, now our number one concern

09:01.771 --> 09:03.972
is that Predators
are watching our body heat.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.140
Peter, that's
just a movie.

09:05.174 --> 09:07.209
That's not real.

09:07.243 --> 09:08.810
(distorted): No, I think we
need to cover ourselves in mud

09:08.845 --> 09:09.845
to avoid being seen.

09:09.879 --> 09:11.013
Peter, Joe's right.

09:11.047 --> 09:12.147
That's
only a movie.

09:12.181 --> 09:13.548
Oh, God,
somebody farted!

09:13.583 --> 09:14.650
Ugh, it stinks!

09:14.684 --> 09:16.101
We should not rule out
the Predator

09:16.135 --> 09:17.135
having been the farter.

09:20.273 --> 09:21.594
Okay, we still
got nothing to eat,

09:21.607 --> 09:22.707
so it looks
like we're gonna

09:22.725 --> 09:24.426
have to hunt
animals for food.

09:24.460 --> 09:25.861
And since we
have no weapons,

09:25.895 --> 09:27.763
I set up some
traps and snares.

09:27.797 --> 09:29.181
Well, I was about to
take a leak.

09:29.215 --> 09:30.315
Can I go
in that direction?

09:30.350 --> 09:31.216
Yes.

09:31.234 --> 09:32.517
(screaming, cracking)
No.

09:32.552 --> 09:34.086
Ah, damn it, my legs!

09:34.120 --> 09:35.187
I think they're broken!

09:35.221 --> 09:36.355
Yay, Joe.

09:36.389 --> 09:37.990
Now you have a friend.

09:41.027 --> 09:42.995
Damn it, Peter,
this is all your fault.

09:43.029 --> 09:44.863
Listen, I wish
you had a family

09:44.897 --> 09:47.783
to take care of you, too,
but that's a choice you made.

09:47.834 --> 09:48.950
Here you go, guys.

09:48.985 --> 09:51.970
First time in a while
I've had wood in my lap.

09:52.005 --> 09:54.306
Are... are we supposed
to laugh at that?

09:54.340 --> 09:55.220
'Cause it's upsetting.

09:55.241 --> 09:56.875
Man, being
out here sucks.

09:56.909 --> 09:58.627
I mean,
I'm not a forest guy.

09:58.661 --> 09:59.728
I-I'm more of a

09:59.762 --> 10:01.296
"take-it-all-in-
at-the-beach" guy.

10:01.331 --> 10:04.166
(sighs contentedly)

10:04.200 --> 10:05.384
Excuse me, sir.

10:05.418 --> 10:06.435
This is
private property.

10:06.469 --> 10:07.486
what are you doing?

10:07.520 --> 10:08.403
(sighs)

10:08.438 --> 10:09.738
Just taking it all in.

10:09.772 --> 10:12.057
You're staring
at my daughter's bedroom.

10:12.091 --> 10:13.925
She's really
grown into her body.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.827
This is gonna
be a fun summer for her.

10:15.862 --> 10:18.046
You guys, we've been out here
a couple days now,

10:18.081 --> 10:20.899
and I don't think
anyone's coming to get us.

10:20.933 --> 10:22.818
It might be time
for one of us to go for help.

10:22.852 --> 10:24.219
Well, what do
you want us to do?

10:24.253 --> 10:25.954
Peter's the
only one who can walk.

10:25.988 --> 10:27.072
What?!

10:27.106 --> 10:28.273
You want me to
just walk out there,

10:28.307 --> 10:29.441
straight into the woods?

10:29.459 --> 10:30.776
Peter, if you don't,

10:30.810 --> 10:33.445
the only other option
is we sit here and wait to die.

10:33.479 --> 10:35.747
(sighs)
All right, I'll do it.

10:35.782 --> 10:36.932
If I just keep walking,

10:36.966 --> 10:38.050
I gotta hit civilization

10:38.084 --> 10:39.051
at some point, right?

10:39.085 --> 10:40.085
Thanks, Peter.

10:40.119 --> 10:41.086
Yeah.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.088
And good luck.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.291
Uh-oh.

10:46.325 --> 10:47.426
What?

10:47.460 --> 10:49.728
Well, I hate to ask
you this, Quagmire,

10:49.762 --> 10:51.329
but do you know how
to change a diaper?

10:51.364 --> 10:52.964
Yeah, of course I know
how to change a diaper.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.900
I saw
<i>Mr. Mom</i> four times.

10:54.934 --> 10:58.487
(air blowing)

10:58.521 --> 11:01.690
(laughing):
That's not how you dry a baby.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.726
He has to do it
'cause his wife has the job.

11:04.761 --> 11:06.728
But motherhood's a job.

11:06.763 --> 11:08.764
M-Motherhood's
a job, too, though.

11:10.666 --> 11:11.783
Morning.

11:11.817 --> 11:12.868
What the hell?!
Where'd you come from?!

11:12.919 --> 11:14.336
Yeah, what are...
what are you doing

11:14.370 --> 11:15.837
out here in the middle
of nowhere?!

11:15.872 --> 11:17.005
Middle of nowhere?!

11:17.039 --> 11:18.540
No, I live right
over there.

11:18.574 --> 11:20.709
What?! A plane crashes
in your backyard,

11:20.743 --> 11:22.377
and you don't say anything?!

11:22.412 --> 11:23.779
This is Canada, eh?

11:23.813 --> 11:26.214
I thought it might be rude to
intrude on your plane crash.

11:26.249 --> 11:27.449
Well, this is
great news!

11:27.483 --> 11:28.617
We're saved!

11:28.651 --> 11:29.985
Yes, I suppose so.

11:30.019 --> 11:32.170
Listen, why don't we
head back to my place,

11:32.205 --> 11:35.040
grab a bite to eat and watch
the big curling match on TV?

11:35.074 --> 11:37.976
Canada is in the world
final against Mexico.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.750
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

11:46.786 --> 11:48.920
(cheering)

11:48.955 --> 11:53.074
(car horn
plays "La Cucaracha")

11:53.109 --> 11:55.127
Okay, well, we have
to grab our friend Peter.

11:55.161 --> 11:57.129
He just headed out
that way to get help.

11:57.163 --> 11:58.863
Oh. That's not good.

11:58.881 --> 12:00.315
There's nothing
in that direction

12:00.349 --> 12:02.300
but wilderness for
thousands of kilometers.

12:02.335 --> 12:03.652
What?! You're kidding.

12:03.686 --> 12:05.420
Oh, crap. Peter!

12:05.471 --> 12:07.539
Peter, come back! Peter!

12:07.573 --> 12:10.926
(garbled, electronic):
Peter! Peter!

12:10.960 --> 12:12.661
I think he's gone.

12:23.322 --> 12:26.274
I'm afraid he might not
have survived, Mrs. Griffin.

12:26.309 --> 12:28.109
We've been searching
these woods for weeks.

12:28.161 --> 12:29.744
We've got to keep looking.

12:29.779 --> 12:31.463
He's got to be out there
somewhere.

12:31.497 --> 12:33.031
Oh, my God,
we're in Canada.

12:33.065 --> 12:35.116
I get to use my
new passport.

12:35.168 --> 12:38.203
I hope my picture
looks okay.

12:38.237 --> 12:39.971
That's Liam Hemsworth.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.423
No, it's not. It's me.

12:41.457 --> 12:42.958
It's just a
really good angle.

12:43.009 --> 12:45.126
God, just look
for Peter. God.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.914
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,

12:48.948 --> 12:51.316
there's been no sign
of your husband for two months.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.051
We're gonna have
to suspend our search.

12:53.085 --> 12:55.353
But there's got to be
something we can do!

12:55.388 --> 12:57.455
Well, the odds were always
against us.

12:57.490 --> 12:59.291
Most black men don't
possess the skills

12:59.325 --> 13:01.193
to survive out here
in the wilderness.

13:01.227 --> 13:02.894
My husband isn't black.

13:02.929 --> 13:04.129
Oh, boy.

13:04.163 --> 13:07.199
Well, then, we need
to regroup because...

13:07.233 --> 13:08.867
we haven't been looking.

13:08.901 --> 13:11.937
Wait! We may have a possible
lead on Peter Griffin!

13:11.971 --> 13:14.139
What?! Oh, my God,
where is he?!

13:14.173 --> 13:17.442
Well, we didn't find him,
but we found this.

13:18.945 --> 13:20.545
And there's some scribbling
on the back

13:20.580 --> 13:21.780
that says, "Mrs. G."

13:21.814 --> 13:25.333
We figured "G" has
to stand for "Griffin."

13:25.384 --> 13:27.552
No. That G isn't for "Griffin."

13:27.587 --> 13:29.588
It's for "Garrett."

13:29.622 --> 13:32.357
This is Mrs. Garrett
from <i>The Facts Of Life!</i>

13:32.391 --> 13:33.842
And <i>Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

13:33.893 --> 13:35.210
Why does everyone forget that?

13:35.244 --> 13:37.295
Kids, your father
made this.

13:37.330 --> 13:38.563
That's so weird.

13:38.598 --> 13:41.132
Dad gets lost in the woods,
and he makes a doll?

13:41.167 --> 13:42.400
Eh, it's not that strange.

13:42.435 --> 13:44.436
It's kind of what Tom Hanks did
in <i>Castaway.</i>

13:44.470 --> 13:46.471
(seagull screeching,
waves crashing)

13:49.659 --> 13:52.561
I'm sorry, Wilson!

13:52.595 --> 13:55.230
(sobbing)

13:59.969 --> 14:01.886
Right here is where
we found the doll.

14:01.921 --> 14:04.623
Okay, everybody fan out
and look for your father.

14:04.657 --> 14:05.990
Peter!
Peter!

14:06.008 --> 14:08.276
Dad!
Fat-ass!

14:08.311 --> 14:10.845
(rustling in brush)

14:13.149 --> 14:15.250
(gasps)
Peter?!

14:20.856 --> 14:21.756
(gasps)

14:21.791 --> 14:23.658
Oh, thank God!
We found you!

14:23.693 --> 14:25.427
Are you okay?!

14:25.461 --> 14:27.662
(grunting and whimpering)

14:27.697 --> 14:28.930
What the hell?!

14:28.965 --> 14:32.000
It looks like he's become
some kind of feral beast.

14:32.034 --> 14:33.268
Oh, my God!

14:33.302 --> 14:35.520
(whimpering and muttering)

14:35.554 --> 14:38.907
I can't live by
society's rules, either.

14:48.799 --> 14:50.566
(grunting and muttering)

14:50.600 --> 14:52.067
Mom, I still
don't get it.

14:52.102 --> 14:54.236
How could Dad turn
into some kind of feral creature

14:54.237 --> 14:56.005
just from two months
in the wilderness?

14:56.039 --> 14:57.240
Yeah,
it's weird.

14:57.274 --> 14:58.474
He doesn't
even talk.

14:58.509 --> 15:01.077
Well, he was living among
wild animals for two months,

15:01.111 --> 15:03.479
and you know how impressionable
your dad can be.

15:05.315 --> 15:08.117
Hmm.

15:09.152 --> 15:11.120
Peter, this
is your home.

15:11.154 --> 15:12.939
(grunting)

15:12.973 --> 15:14.874
This is the couch
where you sit.

15:14.908 --> 15:16.909
(sniffing)

15:19.963 --> 15:22.665
Oh, yes, that's
the television.

15:22.699 --> 15:25.084
Kids, I think he
recognizes the TV.

15:26.453 --> 15:28.821
We're all thinking it,
and he just does it.

15:28.856 --> 15:31.724
(sighs) You guys, this is gonna
be harder than we thought.

15:31.758 --> 15:34.360
I guess we're all just
gonna have to work together

15:34.394 --> 15:37.096
to reintroduce your father
to civilized society.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.731
Well, that's gonna be
a challenge.

15:38.765 --> 15:40.199
But it can't be any harder

15:40.234 --> 15:42.268
than folding
that thousand-mile-long sheet.

15:42.302 --> 15:44.170
All right, I got my corner.
Everybody ready?

15:44.204 --> 15:45.605
Ready. Chris?

15:45.639 --> 15:47.173
Ready. Meg?

15:54.648 --> 15:56.649
You know, long ago,
before this happened,

15:56.683 --> 16:00.386
your father did make some videos
in case he ever became feral.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.622
I guess
they're worth a shot.

16:02.656 --> 16:04.924
Hello, feral Peter.

16:04.958 --> 16:07.393
If you're listening to this,
you've probably become feral,

16:07.427 --> 16:10.663
and you're probably thinking of
a nice juicy rabbit right now.

16:10.697 --> 16:12.565
(muttering)

16:12.599 --> 16:14.333
But this isn't
who you really are, Peter.

16:14.368 --> 16:16.068
We got to get you back on track.

16:16.103 --> 16:17.236
Isn't that right, buddy?

16:17.271 --> 16:18.504
(grunting
and muttering)

16:18.538 --> 16:20.506
(gasps)
Look, it's working!

16:20.540 --> 16:22.008
Okay, good. So, feral Peter,

16:22.042 --> 16:24.911
why don't you put in tape number
two and let's get started.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.785
Don't listen to that Peter!
That Peter is a liar!

16:32.819 --> 16:34.720
Run! Be free!
They will enslave you!

16:34.755 --> 16:36.088
(grunting gibberish)

16:36.123 --> 16:37.089
(grunts gibberish)

16:37.124 --> 16:39.025
(grunting gibberish)

16:39.059 --> 16:40.092
(grunting gibberish loudly)

16:40.127 --> 16:42.695
(grunting gibberish)

16:44.731 --> 16:45.898
All right, now,
I've been trying

16:45.933 --> 16:47.366
to figure out something
we can do together,

16:47.401 --> 16:48.734
and I think
I've found it.

16:48.769 --> 16:49.936
We're gonna sing a song.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.704
Now, I'll start, and
when I point to you,

16:51.738 --> 16:53.639
you'll sing your part.
Ready?

16:53.674 --> 16:55.174
♪ War!
(grunts)

16:55.208 --> 16:57.944
♪ Yeah! What is
it good for? ♪

16:57.978 --> 16:59.645
♪ Absolutely nothing!

16:59.680 --> 17:01.347
Okay, all right,
good job.

17:01.381 --> 17:02.848
Now, let's try
something else.

17:02.883 --> 17:04.717
♪ I wanna get you home and ♪

17:04.751 --> 17:06.519
♪ Double up
♪ Ugh, ugh.

17:06.553 --> 17:08.186
Okay, I like where
this is going.

17:08.221 --> 17:09.488
Let's take it
from the top.

17:09.522 --> 17:12.758
♪ I like big butts
and I cannot lie... ♪

17:12.792 --> 17:14.760
(crickets chirping)

17:14.795 --> 17:16.695
(Peter mutters, thudding)

17:16.730 --> 17:18.631
(Peter gibbering in distance)

17:18.665 --> 17:19.765
(clattering and banging
in distance)

17:19.800 --> 17:22.367
Oh, damn it, he's in
the garbage again!

17:24.805 --> 17:25.938
Oh, my God!

17:25.973 --> 17:28.074
Come on! Get out
of the trash.

17:30.077 --> 17:32.044
Who threw out my sequin top?

17:32.079 --> 17:34.380
STEWIE:
You're 43! Accept it!

17:37.417 --> 17:39.385
(knocking on door)

17:40.420 --> 17:41.587
Hey, Lois.

17:41.621 --> 17:43.089
Oh, hi, Glenn.

17:43.123 --> 17:45.825
We just thought we'd come by
and see how Peter was doing.

17:45.859 --> 17:47.059
Yeah, has he gotten
any better?

17:47.094 --> 17:48.260
I'm afraid not.

17:48.295 --> 17:49.962
He's still only
speaking gibberish.

17:49.997 --> 17:51.997
Yeah, and we could live
without the semen throwing,

17:51.999 --> 17:53.132
I'll tell you that.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.867
I don't know
what else to do.

17:54.901 --> 17:57.203
We've tried everything
to bring the old Peter back,

17:57.237 --> 17:59.672
but we can't
break through to him.

17:59.706 --> 18:02.041
Lois, I think you've
done all you can.

18:02.075 --> 18:03.776
Hard as it is to admit,

18:03.810 --> 18:06.679
it might be time to let
Peter be where he belongs.

18:06.713 --> 18:07.930
What do you mean, Brian?

18:07.964 --> 18:10.733
We might have to release
Peter back into the wild.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.268
What?! We-we can't do that.

18:12.302 --> 18:14.603
We'll never
see him again!

18:14.638 --> 18:16.706
Eh, enough time passes,
you'll forget all about him.

18:16.740 --> 18:18.407
Just like
Inspector Gadget forgot

18:18.442 --> 18:20.109
about that one-night stand.

18:20.143 --> 18:21.777
Suzanne, we have to talk.

18:21.812 --> 18:23.045
Okay.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.247
Someone has made
contact with me.

18:25.282 --> 18:29.151
Someone from my past, and,
well, long story short,

18:29.186 --> 18:32.221
go, go, Guatemalan son.

18:35.258 --> 18:38.494
(speaking gibberish)

18:38.528 --> 18:41.664
Peter, we all
love you very much,

18:41.698 --> 18:43.966
but we think maybe
this is where you belong

18:44.000 --> 18:46.068
and where you'll be happy.

18:46.103 --> 18:47.636
This is barely
even a forest.

18:47.671 --> 18:49.739
I can see an Arby's
through the trees.

18:49.773 --> 18:51.207
(cries)

18:51.241 --> 18:52.475
You're free, Peter.

18:52.509 --> 18:54.577
Whatever adventures
lie ahead of you,

18:54.611 --> 18:57.980
know that my heart
will always be with you.

18:58.014 --> 19:01.083
Now, go! Go on!
Get out of here!

19:04.588 --> 19:06.088
(gibbering)

19:06.123 --> 19:08.774
I always knew, one day,
this would happen.

19:08.809 --> 19:12.411
We will never forget you,
but you're better off here.

19:12.446 --> 19:14.547
Why are we dragging this out?
It's 6:30.

19:14.581 --> 19:16.849
Go ahead, Peter.
Go on!

19:16.883 --> 19:18.651
Be with your own kind!

19:21.621 --> 19:23.389
We're all gonna
miss you, Dad!

19:23.423 --> 19:25.091
More than you know!

19:26.460 --> 19:29.428
(speaking gibberish)

19:29.463 --> 19:31.063
What?
My God, I...

19:31.098 --> 19:33.199
I think he's trying
to talk to you.

19:33.233 --> 19:34.400
(gasps)
Quick, Meg!

19:34.434 --> 19:35.601
Say something else!

19:35.635 --> 19:37.570
Well, okay, um...

19:37.604 --> 19:39.038
I love you, Dad,

19:39.072 --> 19:41.941
and no matter where you are,
you'll always be my father.

19:41.975 --> 19:44.243
(speaking gibberish)

19:44.277 --> 19:46.679
Shut... up...

19:46.713 --> 19:48.114
M-Meg.

19:48.148 --> 19:49.682
(all gasp)
I don't believe it!

19:49.716 --> 19:51.217
Peter, you talked!

19:51.251 --> 19:53.285
(garbled):
Shut up, Meg.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.521
Shut... up, Meg.

19:55.555 --> 19:58.224
Shut up... Meg.

19:58.258 --> 20:00.226
Shut up, Meg.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.427
Peter!
CHRIS: Dad!

20:01.461 --> 20:03.229
BRIAN: You're back!
MEG (flatly): Yay.

20:06.349 --> 20:08.317
Jim.

20:08.351 --> 20:11.086
Your name is Jim.

20:11.121 --> 20:13.022
Close enough, Peter!

20:13.056 --> 20:14.824
Come on, you guys,
let's go home!

20:14.858 --> 20:16.425
(overlapping chatter)

20:16.459 --> 20:17.593
Yeah!

20:17.627 --> 20:19.595
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

20:19.629 --> 20:22.264
STEWIE: Is she...
is she letting him drive?

20:25.535 --> 20:27.703
Boy, I sure am happy
to be back.

20:27.737 --> 20:30.172
Yeah, Peter, we thought
we'd lost you for good.

20:30.207 --> 20:31.807
And luckily,
I don't know many words,

20:31.842 --> 20:34.376
so I was able to relearn them
all in a day.

20:34.411 --> 20:35.945
Don't ever leave
us again, Dad.

20:35.979 --> 20:37.613
Aw, sorry, Chris,
but this weekend,

20:37.647 --> 20:39.982
Quagmire's taking me
to a Canadian strip club.

20:40.016 --> 20:43.552
He said he's put together a very
special surprise, just for me.

20:43.587 --> 20:45.621
MAN (French accent, over P.A.):
<i>Mesdames et monsieurs,</i>

20:45.655 --> 20:48.290
all the way from America,
please welcome

20:48.325 --> 20:50.025
Miss Charlotte Rae!

20:50.060 --> 20:52.294
(applause and cheering)

20:52.329 --> 20:54.496
Mrs. Garrett!
Mrs. Garrett!

20:54.531 --> 20:56.832
Girls, girls, girls!
