WEBVTT

00:03.433 --> 00:05.933
Aah!
It's the princess of darkness.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.500
Regine, it's cute,
you look like a felt tip pen.

00:13.766 --> 00:16.766
When I go out with Keith
I like to dress metaphorically.

00:16.833 --> 00:20.266
See, black reminds us
that we are all mortal

00:20.333 --> 00:21.833
and it's right up there
with pin stripes

00:21.900 --> 00:24.400
when it comes to slimming.

00:24.466 --> 00:26.266
Y'all go to a performance
or a thing where

00:26.333 --> 00:29.633
somebody stands on a vat of
beef gravy and reads Moby Dick?

00:31.100 --> 00:33.033
No, girl, we could not
get tickets to that.

00:34.633 --> 00:36.733
So, tonight, I'm just gonna go
and watch him paint.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.233
Isn't that boring?

00:38.300 --> 00:40.000
Not when you stand behind him,
honey.

00:40.066 --> 00:42.400
‐ He has got the tush of a God.
‐ Hello.

00:44.066 --> 00:45.666
[doorbell rings]

00:47.666 --> 00:49.600
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey, baby.

00:51.066 --> 00:53.233
Keith, Keith,
we were talking.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.700
Who would you pick?
Rembrandt or Picasso?

00:56.766 --> 00:57.833
I wouldn't even compare them.

00:57.900 --> 00:59.366
Their painting styles
are so different.

00:59.433 --> 01:01.373
No, I mean, in a fight.

01:36.673 --> 01:37.940
for McFadden and Spencer's

01:38.006 --> 01:41.840
new associate director
of funds management

01:41.906 --> 01:45.240
Kyle, head brother in charge,
Barker.

01:45.306 --> 01:46.573
Give it up, y'all.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.473
Come here, big poppa!

01:55.306 --> 01:57.340
Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo.

02:00.140 --> 02:02.680
Kyle, you cheap bastard.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.180
Man, you get a big promotion

02:04.246 --> 02:06.146
you cannot even
spring for champagne.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.680
Oh, we just polished off
a nice bottle upstairs.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.980
Matter of fact,
my nose still tickling.

02:13.046 --> 02:15.913
So, what does a director
of a management association

02:15.980 --> 02:17.646
what, whatever, do?

02:17.713 --> 02:20.013
It's associate director
of funds management

02:20.080 --> 02:22.480
and I'm not entirely sure.

02:22.546 --> 02:25.213
But generally speaking
I'll be helping to predict

02:25.280 --> 02:27.313
the long range
financial climate.

02:27.380 --> 02:31.680
But I also get a larger office,
a larger ficus

02:31.746 --> 02:34.713
and an executive door closer.

02:34.780 --> 02:40.046
No offence, Kyle, but those
perks don't sound very...perky.

02:42.346 --> 02:43.513
At the executive picnic

02:43.580 --> 02:46.213
I also get unlimited darts
at the balloon pop.

02:47.613 --> 02:50.113
Brother, you have arrived.
You're the man!

02:54.313 --> 02:55.780
Thanks, man.

02:57.946 --> 02:59.886
[laughing]

03:01.520 --> 03:03.520
How do you feel,
Mr. Associate Director

03:03.586 --> 03:05.086
of funds management?

03:05.153 --> 03:07.820
Like I bought Microsoft when
it was just ten cents a share.

03:09.453 --> 03:10.686
I just dropped by to see

03:10.753 --> 03:12.420
how you're settling
into your new digs.

03:12.486 --> 03:14.686
Oh, have you
checked out your view?

03:19.886 --> 03:23.486
Oh, Barker, this is Jordan,
the top assistant in our pool.

03:23.553 --> 03:25.520
You'd better watch out though,
she wants your job.

03:25.586 --> 03:27.520
[laughing]

03:27.586 --> 03:29.820
He's right.

03:29.886 --> 03:32.520
Mr. Higgins, Ms. Johnson
called to confirm the buy order

03:32.586 --> 03:34.720
of 100,000 shares of Sirus.

03:34.786 --> 03:38.453
Sirus! She was supposed to
buy Cypress.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.986
Boy, communication around here
really bites my bunion.

03:43.753 --> 03:46.553
Well, I hope you're ready
for a busy day, Mr. Barker?

03:46.620 --> 03:48.186
No, please,
you can call me Kyle.

03:49.086 --> 03:50.753
No.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.453
'Shall we go through
your day's agenda?'

03:53.520 --> 03:56.953
Great.
Today is devoted to tax law.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.553
At 8:30, you will have a meeting

03:58.620 --> 04:00.786
where you'll be briefed
on your 9:30 meeting.

04:00.853 --> 04:03.793
At 9:15, you'll have a meeting
to discuss the 8:30 meeting.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.326
At noon, you'll summarize
the meetings over lunch.

04:06.393 --> 04:07.693
'A recap at 1:00.'

04:07.760 --> 04:09.826
'A conference call on the
previous meetings at 1:30.'

04:09.893 --> 04:11.626
And then, a series of meetings.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.826
Am I gonna spend
my whole day on this?

04:18.892 --> 04:21.560
Well, you know, Mr. Barker,
there are people who would kill

04:21.625 --> 04:23.826
and I do mean kill,
for your job.

04:25.426 --> 04:27.926
I see, no, it's just I was
hoping to spend some time

04:27.993 --> 04:29.693
doing some trading today.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.493
Mr. Barker, there are people
on lower floors who do that.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.093
You're the associate director
of funds management now.

04:35.993 --> 04:38.993
Oh. Could you say that again?

04:40.626 --> 04:41.960
Was I not clear?

04:42.026 --> 04:45.293
Yes, I just want to hear
you say my title out loud again.

04:51.493 --> 04:52.793
Oh!

04:55.126 --> 04:58.893
Keith, I took art history
in night school.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.033
Mind if a semi pro
takes a peek at your pictures?

05:02.100 --> 05:04.066
Sure. These are mostly nudes.

05:04.133 --> 05:09.066
Ah, life renderings,
capturing the human spirit.

05:10.333 --> 05:13.000
Whoa, look at the
tatas on this one!

05:15.000 --> 05:16.600
Well, there's some
naked men in here too.

05:16.666 --> 05:19.100
[laughs]

05:19.166 --> 05:23.566
Oh, oh, no, ah, yes,
I think I know this brother.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.066
I think I know him.

05:26.366 --> 05:29.000
Max, you can only see
this guy from the waist down.

05:29.066 --> 05:31.000
That's pretty much
how the date went.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.400
Max, this is about
form and texture, alright?

05:36.466 --> 05:37.700
Not about some peep show.

05:37.766 --> 05:38.833
Whoa.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.000
So, it doesn't bother you
when Keith stares hours

05:42.066 --> 05:44.033
on end at some naked woman?

05:44.100 --> 05:45.566
Even if she has a body
like, uh‐‐

05:45.633 --> 05:47.433
This one.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.466
Oh, gee!

05:50.533 --> 05:52.966
Max, try and climb
out of the gutter, huh?

05:53.033 --> 05:55.300
Come on, honey,
I'm aesthetically mature.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.173
Okay, sign me up
as your next nude model.

06:02.373 --> 06:03.773
I want to be art.

06:05.206 --> 06:07.940
Why don't you go to the top
of the World Trade Center

06:08.006 --> 06:13.340
flash New Jersey...and straight
get it out of your system?

06:13.406 --> 06:16.940
No, I'm serious.
I want to be taken seriously.

06:17.006 --> 06:19.106
[laughs]

06:19.173 --> 06:21.606
I would love to be
immortalized by an artist.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.440
Well, I'm not the one.
I'm going out with Regine.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.573
The Bohemian?

06:28.240 --> 06:30.573
Or could it be her love of art
isn't nearly as deep

06:30.640 --> 06:33.840
as her fear of
the power of my nakedness?

06:35.373 --> 06:36.806
Go ahead and pose, you freak.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.506
I don't know about this, baby.

06:39.573 --> 06:42.306
No, Keith, honey,
I'm not bothered by it.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.673
So, what do you say?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.806
Well, I have been looking
for a new model

06:49.873 --> 06:51.773
for my series
called "Women Warriors."

06:52.673 --> 06:54.606
[ululating]

07:00.006 --> 07:01.946
Alright, shall we?

07:03.646 --> 07:07.246
First up, you may have
noticed a new face

07:07.313 --> 07:09.980
reflected off
the old walnut here?

07:10.046 --> 07:12.646
Please, give it up
for Kyle Barker.

07:15.246 --> 07:16.380
Thank you, thank you.

07:16.446 --> 07:18.213
Uh, when I first
joined the firm, I‐‐

07:18.280 --> 07:20.213
Don't make a speech, Kyle.

07:22.380 --> 07:25.346
Sarah, um, last time,
I believe you were concluding

07:25.413 --> 07:28.346
your forepart briefing
on the long term direction

07:28.413 --> 07:29.946
of the price of corn.

07:30.013 --> 07:32.113
‐ Wheat.
‐ Wheat.

07:33.946 --> 07:35.680
We have determined
that the price of wheat

07:35.746 --> 07:38.280
will be directly related
to the price of corn.

07:39.013 --> 07:40.313
Who do we have on corn?

07:40.380 --> 07:41.346
No one.

07:42.313 --> 07:44.880
Barker, it's on your plate.

07:44.946 --> 07:47.313
Next meeting,
we'll be all ears.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.313
[chuckles]

07:48.380 --> 07:49.713
[laughing]

07:51.546 --> 07:52.980
Oh, uh, speaking of Barker

07:53.046 --> 07:55.746
I believe you prepared
a report on coffee makers?

07:55.813 --> 07:59.246
[chuckles]
Yes, I have,
and it's been a real grind.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.153
[laughs]

08:02.220 --> 08:03.720
Alrighty, then.

08:05.386 --> 08:08.553
Um, I recommend that we purchase
Messerschmitt Dripmeisters

08:08.620 --> 08:09.786
for our regional offices.

08:09.853 --> 08:11.620
They're efficient, eye‐pleasing

08:11.686 --> 08:14.220
and they come with a lifetime
guarantee against rust.

08:15.486 --> 08:17.286
I say we fast track that.

08:20.653 --> 08:21.986
It was nothing, really.

08:22.053 --> 08:24.653
Oh, but I did find out that
Messerschmitt is selling off

08:24.720 --> 08:26.520
its failing
toaster‐oven division

08:26.586 --> 08:27.853
and I suggest we put our people

08:27.920 --> 08:29.653
into Messerschmitt stock
in a big way.

08:32.020 --> 08:35.020
Kyle, you're new,
so I'll explain this once.

08:35.086 --> 08:37.885
Recommending specific stocks
is what you used to do.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.253
Yes, Jeffrey,
but this is something I‐‐

08:39.320 --> 08:41.986
[laughing]
I'm explaining this
more than once.

08:44.153 --> 08:46.986
Kyle, up here,
on the 17th floor

08:47.053 --> 08:49.120
we take the long view.

08:49.186 --> 08:51.320
We make the big decisions.

08:51.386 --> 08:54.453
Which reminds me where are we
ordering lunch from today?

08:54.520 --> 08:56.486
I‐I was thinking of Cuban.

08:56.553 --> 08:58.186
How about sushi?

08:58.253 --> 09:00.693
How about...both?

09:00.760 --> 09:01.960
Oh.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.560
‐ Hey, Khadijah.
‐ Hey.

09:13.626 --> 09:15.393
Aren't you supposed to be
at a dinner meeting?

09:15.460 --> 09:16.893
Uh, the junior vice president

09:16.960 --> 09:18.893
I was supposed to meet
just died.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.926
I'm sorry.

09:21.993 --> 09:24.726
Uh, he was 98,
he overtaxed his heartburn

09:24.793 --> 09:26.760
buttoning his cardigan too fast.

09:30.060 --> 09:32.326
I hate my job.

09:32.393 --> 09:33.760
[sobbing]

09:35.393 --> 09:38.626
Well, I thought
you were the big executive?

09:38.693 --> 09:44.326
I am, but I am drowning
in a sea of tedium.

09:44.393 --> 09:47.193
Oh, if I could squeeze through
that tiny porthole

09:47.260 --> 09:50.026
they call a window,
I'd jump to my death.

09:50.093 --> 09:52.260
[laughs]
Well, Kyle, if you're bored

09:52.326 --> 09:54.326
why don't you just ask
for your old job back?

09:56.193 --> 09:58.926
Khadijah, the Kyle career
elevator only goes

09:58.993 --> 10:01.000
in one direction, baby,
that's up.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.466
I'm beginning to think the
only way to preserve my sanity

10:03.533 --> 10:06.300
is go in there tomorrow
and resign.

10:06.366 --> 10:08.966
Well, whatever you decide,
I'm with you.

10:09.033 --> 10:11.366
Hundred percent.

10:11.433 --> 10:13.233
Unless you get to
borrowin' money from me.

10:15.433 --> 10:16.466
Here he is,
Reverend Taylor.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.600
Associate director
of funds management.

10:18.666 --> 10:20.000
[laughs]

10:20.066 --> 10:23.933
Kyle, I just had to come by
and tell you how proud I am.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.300
Oh, thank‐thank you
very much, Taylor.

10:27.366 --> 10:29.400
Hey, what's up,
Reverend Taylor?

10:29.466 --> 10:32.233
Not your attendance at church.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.366
Well, see‐‐

10:33.433 --> 10:35.100
I wake her up
every Sunday morning

10:35.166 --> 10:37.966
but Satan lulls her
right back to sleep, sir.

10:39.933 --> 10:42.933
Eh, as soon as Overton told me
about your big promotion

10:43.000 --> 10:45.366
I thought, "Mm‐hmm‐hmm‐hmm

10:45.433 --> 10:48.133
what a fine example
for our young folks."

10:48.200 --> 10:49.500
That's right.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.833
When my daddy,
the Reverend Taylor Senior..

10:53.900 --> 10:56.300
You see, well,
he was marching with Martin..

10:56.366 --> 10:58.600
...Luther King Junior.

10:58.666 --> 11:01.973
You see, he was marching
for you and me, Kyle.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.340
And you haven't failed him.

11:03.406 --> 11:05.606
Reverend Taylor,
it's just a job.

11:05.673 --> 11:07.373
I mean, jobs come and they go.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.473
Oh, no! It's not just a job.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.506
You see, it's a shining star
to which our young people

11:15.573 --> 11:18.006
can steer their course
into the future.

11:18.073 --> 11:19.173
You see, that's why I want you

11:19.240 --> 11:21.573
to speak to the
young achiever's program.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.406
So you can show them with hard
work and perseverance like yours

11:25.473 --> 11:28.040
that no door is left closed,
huh.

11:28.106 --> 11:30.606
No door. No door.

11:35.306 --> 11:37.240
He starts speaking in tongues,
I'm outtie.

11:43.306 --> 11:45.773
Five thousand shares
of Glaser Techtronics.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.006
[computer beeps]

11:47.073 --> 11:48.240
Sell.

11:48.306 --> 11:52.106
Ten thousand shares
of Kan Com Com.

11:52.173 --> 11:53.840
Buy.

11:53.906 --> 11:56.973
Go forth and multiply,
you beautiful little money, you.

12:00.140 --> 12:03.046
Oh, downloading nudies
from the internet?

12:03.113 --> 12:04.580
[chuckles]

12:04.646 --> 12:07.080
Busted. What can I do for you?

12:07.146 --> 12:08.913
Well, this is volume two
of the research‐‐

12:08.980 --> 12:12.313
Jordan, please leave us alone,
and shut the door.

12:12.380 --> 12:14.813
Oh, well, if you need me
I'll be at my desk

12:14.880 --> 12:17.446
skipping my lunch
for the good of the company.

12:18.646 --> 12:21.546
Kyle, we have
a real problem here.

12:21.613 --> 12:24.780
Someone is using your
access number to make trades.

12:24.846 --> 12:26.346
Uh, he's very aggressive
and actually‐‐

12:26.413 --> 12:29.446
Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
I made those trades.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.646
Why?

12:31.713 --> 12:32.880
[sighs]

12:32.946 --> 12:34.680
Look, I know
I wasn't supposed to, right

12:34.746 --> 12:37.546
but I want to take a dip
in the shark‐infested waters

12:37.613 --> 12:40.080
you know, keep my skills honed.

12:40.146 --> 12:45.113
Listen, Kyle, I know that middle
management is not very exciting

12:45.180 --> 12:47.713
but if you can just
take this kind of boredom

12:47.780 --> 12:50.546
for five, ten years
without cracking

12:50.613 --> 12:52.280
you're corner office material.

12:53.646 --> 12:55.913
Even if you crack,
we won't fire you

12:55.980 --> 12:58.580
we'll just medicate you
and put you on the 13th floor.

13:00.246 --> 13:03.186
So, Jeffrey, are you this
bored with what you do too?

13:03.253 --> 13:07.620
Oh, no, once you get to
where I am, it's fun again.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.020
So, wait, wait, how did you
get through the tedium?

13:10.086 --> 13:12.253
Two words, Donkey Kong.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.886
Alright, why don't you just
take off your robe

13:24.720 --> 13:25.986
and get comfortable?

13:32.053 --> 13:35.120
Okay, why don't you
take off that robe

13:35.186 --> 13:37.620
and get comfortable?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.186
‐ Hey, baby.
‐ Hey.

13:40.553 --> 13:44.120
Max, what are you doing here..
Oh, yes, that's right.

13:44.186 --> 13:47.653
Today's the day that my baby
here is painting stick figures.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.553
Baby, you look great,
I didn't expect you.

13:51.620 --> 13:54.620
Please, Pavlov's dogs
were less predictable.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.153
I brought you a little gift.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.720
See, we've been dating
each other

13:59.786 --> 14:02.560
for eight weeks and three days.

14:02.626 --> 14:04.093
Happy anniversary.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.926
Cinnamon rolls?

14:05.993 --> 14:08.193
It's the dough anniversary

14:09.526 --> 14:11.360
and, uh, I thought that
I'd bake them.

14:11.426 --> 14:13.393
‐ Here.
‐ Mmm.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.960
Good, put extra icing on mine.

14:16.026 --> 14:17.626
I'm going to work up
quite an appetite

14:17.693 --> 14:19.326
standing here buck naked.

14:20.893 --> 14:24.160
Oh, uh‐uh‐uh, Max, um,
wouldn't you like something

14:24.226 --> 14:26.193
to drink before you get started?

14:26.260 --> 14:28.193
Nope, I just wanna get naked.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.626
[laughing]

14:31.160 --> 14:33.326
[laughs]

14:33.393 --> 14:35.526
Synclaire, Khadijah,
what are y'all doing here?

14:35.593 --> 14:37.660
Oh, I wanted to
see this free‐for‐all

14:37.726 --> 14:42.693
but Synclaire insisted
that we, uh, have an excuse.

14:42.760 --> 14:46.260
Maxine, this important
carpet cleaning offer

14:46.326 --> 14:48.960
addressed to you
came to us by mistake.

14:50.293 --> 14:53.526
‐ Feel better?
‐ Yeah, watch the show.

14:58.293 --> 15:01.300
Max, you pierced
your belly button.

15:01.366 --> 15:04.133
No, no, that‐that's
just‐just a clip‐on.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.966
Yes, yes, as Keith's eyes
work up and down my body

15:08.033 --> 15:10.800
I wanted there to be
little treats along the way.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.800
[laughs]

15:15.166 --> 15:17.433
Alright, see, maybe
we should forget about this.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.900
No, no, you‐you‐you
have to paint her

15:19.966 --> 15:22.466
because I don't know if
she could handle yet another man

15:22.533 --> 15:23.600
telling her to forget it

15:23.666 --> 15:25.600
once he's seen her
with her clothes off.

15:27.466 --> 15:29.233
See, I told you
this was gonna be better

15:29.300 --> 15:31.233
than watching "Toy Story"
for the third time.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.066
Keith, could you turn up
the heat?

15:35.133 --> 15:37.733
I wouldn't want to
blind you with my high beams.

15:40.033 --> 15:41.633
Alright, that's it.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.900
I admit it, okay?

15:44.966 --> 15:48.500
I‐I‐I'm not hip enough to handle
some freaky exhibitionist

15:48.566 --> 15:50.600
put on a show for my man.

15:50.666 --> 15:52.000
My goodness, Maxima!

15:52.066 --> 15:56.133
S‐s‐s‐strippers at marine bases
have more shame.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.466
[laughs]
I knew it.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.740
All this talk about you being
aesthetically mature.

16:00.806 --> 16:04.473
Hah! Phooey! Oh, yeah, I'm just
so fine you just can't stand it!

16:04.540 --> 16:05.673
Ooh!

16:07.906 --> 16:09.206
And you.

16:09.273 --> 16:12.106
Where did you get off letting
her pose just cause I insisted?

16:12.173 --> 16:16.073
Well, frankly, I was kinda
tripping when you insisted

16:16.140 --> 16:17.706
that Max pose
in the first place.

16:17.773 --> 16:20.440
I mean, come on, baby,
this is bizarre.

16:20.506 --> 16:23.273
I know I'm an artist,
but I'm also your man.

16:28.840 --> 16:31.073
No, unh‐unh, that's it?

16:31.140 --> 16:33.173
See that, Max,
in your own special way

16:33.240 --> 16:35.773
you brought two people
closer together.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.973
Say look, all I know is that
when my drawers hit the floor

16:39.040 --> 16:41.006
the meter started.
You owe me 35 bucks.

16:44.073 --> 16:45.340
I didn't even paint you.

16:47.606 --> 16:50.540
Okay, then you owe me
50 bucks for being a tease.

16:54.006 --> 16:56.440
Young achievers,
now, I know we all enjoyed

16:56.506 --> 16:59.406
our tour of the brokerage firm,
from the executive lounge

16:59.473 --> 17:02.480
on down to the
document shredding area.

17:02.546 --> 17:05.746
But now, we're fortunate
to have a very special speaker

17:05.813 --> 17:09.280
and here to introduce him
is last month's speaker

17:09.346 --> 17:11.346
Brother Overton Wakefield Jones.

17:12.113 --> 17:13.512
Thank you.

17:14.880 --> 17:17.546
Uh, during the time
we had together last month

17:17.613 --> 17:20.246
I got a chance to learn
a little bit about yourselves

17:20.313 --> 17:23.780
and your dreams, like,
Danielle, you dream of

17:23.846 --> 17:27.046
a chain of pork chop
on a stick franchises.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.213
And Paul here
is waiting to foreclose

17:30.280 --> 17:32.046
on the home for the elderly.

17:33.713 --> 17:37.080
I realize y'all have doubts,
well, doubt no more because

17:37.146 --> 17:40.680
men like Kyle Barker have
blazed a trail for you.

17:40.746 --> 17:43.046
I'm proud to call him friend

17:43.113 --> 17:45.946
proud to call him roommate..

17:46.013 --> 17:47.280
...shorty.

17:48.913 --> 17:50.046
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle.

17:56.246 --> 17:57.280
[sighs]

17:57.346 --> 17:58.986
[Kyle clears throat]

18:06.120 --> 18:08.286
I hate my job.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.586
I'll get back to you.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.353
Yeah, that's it, kids,
start off with a joke.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.086
See, that's the key
to every good speech‐‐

18:13.153 --> 18:15.553
No, no, no,
I really hate my job.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.086
It's‐it's just not
what I want to do.

18:18.153 --> 18:19.586
I love to trade stocks.

18:19.653 --> 18:22.053
‐ But you're getting crazy pay.
‐ Exactly.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.586
Danielle,
it's not about the money.

18:23.653 --> 18:25.353
[indistinct chatter]

18:25.420 --> 18:27.453
Whoa, ooh, young achievers

18:27.520 --> 18:29.986
uh, uh, settle down,
I‐I'm sure, uh, Brother Barker

18:30.053 --> 18:34.120
is going somewhere with this.

18:34.186 --> 18:37.120
No, see, that's the problem,
I'm not going anywhere.

18:37.186 --> 18:40.886
I'm trapped,
I can't go backwards.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.220
I can't stay here where I am

18:42.286 --> 18:44.520
and that means
I can't go forwards.

18:44.586 --> 18:46.986
‐ Classic corporate conundrum.
‐ Yeah.

18:47.053 --> 18:48.620
With a simple solution.

18:48.686 --> 18:50.886
Don't forget how you created
the African mutual fund.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.253
‐ You know about that?
‐ Know it?

18:54.320 --> 18:56.586
I moved most of
my dad's pension into it, buddy.

18:58.186 --> 19:03.393
When you found an area with no
opportunities, you created one.

19:04.493 --> 19:05.793
Why not do the same
with your job?

19:07.160 --> 19:11.360
Of course, and I know just
how to implement that thinking.

19:11.426 --> 19:13.360
You know, you're pretty sharp,
what's your name?

19:13.426 --> 19:15.026
It'll be on the invoice.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.760
You remind me of myself
when I was half your age.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.426
Uh, reverend,
if you'll excuse me

19:22.493 --> 19:24.326
I have to go
and work out this idea.

19:24.393 --> 19:26.393
Well, Brother Kyle
as the pharaoh said

19:26.460 --> 19:28.360
to the children of Israel.

19:28.426 --> 19:30.560
"Get to going."

19:30.626 --> 19:31.560
"Get to going."

19:32.826 --> 19:34.193
[knock on door]

19:34.260 --> 19:36.360
I got your e‐mail. Well done.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.393
I have an idea
I want to run by you.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.393
Something off
the top of my head.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.660
Oh, and now
that's what I like.

19:43.726 --> 19:46.960
An impulsive idea
with detailed graphic support.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.493
Lately, Jeffrey, you know,
I have been distressed.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.826
I have noticed
the lack of communication

19:56.893 --> 19:59.533
between the trading bullpen
and senior management.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.533
Uh, we're just
not hearing each other.

20:04.266 --> 20:07.200
So, I propose,
we create a new position.

20:07.266 --> 20:10.366
A position of
executive liaison.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.000
Someone who would
split their time between

20:13.066 --> 20:15.233
the executive offices
and the trading bullpen.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.966
That way we'll have
someone down there

20:17.033 --> 20:18.966
who understands
the overall priorities

20:19.033 --> 20:20.766
and someone up here
who understands

20:20.833 --> 20:23.033
the moment to moment dealings
of the people on the front line.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.966
I see, and did you have
anyone particular in mind

20:27.033 --> 20:28.700
to fill this unique position?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.100
[laughing]

20:34.166 --> 20:36.633
Kyle, you are as thorough
as you are vain.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.233
Even more so, sir.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.500
Well, I have to admit
it's a fascinating proposal

20:42.566 --> 20:44.533
but you're on the fast track.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.366
If you take
a side shift like this

20:46.433 --> 20:48.766
it may stall you, career wise.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.633
Well, Jeffrey,
risk is our business

20:50.700 --> 20:54.300
and if it should not work out,
I can always pack up my things

20:54.366 --> 20:56.133
and try my hand
at starting my own firm.

20:56.833 --> 20:58.100
Message received.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.206
Do you realize I'll have to
fill your position

21:01.273 --> 21:05.006
and that means you're gonna
lose a few perks like the tree.

21:05.073 --> 21:06.040
Oh, fine.

21:06.106 --> 21:07.940
And the door closer.

21:08.006 --> 21:09.006
Ouch.

21:09.073 --> 21:10.573
And the worst news of all

21:10.640 --> 21:12.573
you'll have to settle
for less money.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.973
How much less?

21:17.040 --> 21:20.140
Let's just say,
you won't be smiling that much.

21:22.306 --> 21:23.740
<i>(Synclaire)</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:28.332 --> 21:30.341

'Now, man's first tool
was the hand'

21:30.407 --> 21:34.007
which dates back
to 250,000 BC.

21:34.074 --> 21:36.607
That piece of flint was all
you had to do everything.

21:38.841 --> 21:40.907
What those Neanderthals
wouldn't have given

21:40.974 --> 21:44.341
for a Swiss army knife,
huh, kids?

21:44.407 --> 21:46.641
Now, when you talk
about farm equipment

21:46.707 --> 21:48.907
that's a whole different
kettle of fish.

21:50.074 --> 21:53.174
In Mesopotamia,
early forms of ploughs

21:53.241 --> 21:55.007
'were little more
than forked branch'

21:55.074 --> 21:56.741
'dragged through the soil
by a pair of oxen.'

21:56.807 --> 21:58.307
'Uh, uh, reverend?'

21:58.374 --> 22:00.581
'Uh, if you go
past the water cooler'

22:00.647 --> 22:01.881
'could you
bring me back a cup?'

22:01.947 --> 22:03.447
'I'm a bit parched.'

22:05.281 --> 22:06.214
Now, where was I?

<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
