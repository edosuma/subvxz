00:03.000 --> 00:05.400
(folk song playing )

00:05.300 --> 00:08.300
¶ I wanna die ¶

00:10.000 --> 00:13.700
¶ I wanna die ¶

00:14.700 --> 00:19.300
¶ Down south Louisiana ¶

00:19.200 --> 00:22.900
¶ And grey evening sky.¶

00:22.800 --> 00:24.500
Woman:
June 21st.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.800
Exile to Siberia.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.400
I mean, New Jersey.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.300
Is there a difference?

00:31.300 --> 00:33.300
I can't tell.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.800
Isn't Siberia the place
they send you to die?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.700
And from my experience

00:37.700 --> 00:39.800
Ocean Grove isn't that much different.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.100
I think the median age is 85

00:44.100 --> 00:47.900
with the life expectancy of 86.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.000
Sounds about right to me.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.300
Thanks, Mom.

00:53.300 --> 00:55.900
Thank you for buying me
a one-way ticket to hell.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.700
I mean,
Grams' and Gramps' mausoleum.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.100
where it always smells like
desiccated socks.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.200
Oh, I'm sure they're thrilled too.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.400
It'll just be one great summer
of Chinese torture for all of us.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.900
Who cares anyway?

01:13.900 --> 01:15.900
Nobody.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.000
Actually, maybe Ocean Grove
is the perfect place for me.

01:18.900 --> 01:21.300
In fact, when I get off this bus

01:21.200 --> 01:24.000
I should just walk over to the pier
and jump,

01:23.900 --> 01:26.300
end it all.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.100
Goodbye, world.
Goodbye, New Jersey.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.300
The truth is, if I weren't around,

01:32.100 --> 01:35.900
it would solve everyone's problems.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.900
Mom could really focus
on saving marriage number nine.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.800
And my grandmother--

01:40.700 --> 01:43.400
well, she could spend
her whole summer

01:43.300 --> 01:46.000
making those seashell
thingies she makes.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.900
And Gramps could finally finish

01:47.900 --> 01:49.700
fixing up that boat of his.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.300
Yeah, Grams definitely wouldn't care
if I weren't around.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.500
I swear she has some serious
anxiety issues.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.100
Maybe I should give her
some of my pills.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.100
That's what I should do--

02:01.100 --> 02:03.200
make it easy on everyone.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.500
If I weren't here,
their lives would be better.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.600
There's only one person
who might actually care,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.600
but Dad isn't around anymore.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074

02:30.200 --> 02:32.800
( man snoring )

02:49.000 --> 02:51.400
( coughing )

02:56.500 --> 02:58.800
Buses suck, huh?

03:05.600 --> 03:08.400
Great. Hello, New Jersey!

03:08.300 --> 03:10.500
Good times, good times.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.300
Hi, sweetie.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.000
Greta, how nice to see you.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.900
Gramps, Grams, hi.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.800
You folks don't look so bad,

03:23.700 --> 03:25.300
all things considered.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.300
Hello to you too, Greta.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.800
Yeah, hello hello.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.600
We all know why I'm here.
No need to act thrilled about it.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.600
We're glad to have you here, honey.
We really are.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.900
Yeah, well, I didn't really plan
on spending my summer in Jersey,

03:59.800 --> 04:03.700
in what might as well be
a nursing home.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.400
Gramps: Well, I guess you're glad
to be out of school for the summer, right?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.800
If I cared one microbe
about school,

04:11.600 --> 04:15.600
I guess yeah, it'd be some kind
of a relief.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.000
Your mother said
you were on the honor roll all year.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.500
That's terrific.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.500
You should be proud of yourself.
You'll get into a good college.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.600
I'm not going to college.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.700
Of course you're going
to college.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.900
The fact is that I'm gonna kill myself
before I turn 18,

04:27.800 --> 04:31.800
so that doesn't really leave much time
for an undergraduate degree.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.100
I assume that you understand

04:34.000 --> 04:36.300
that a joke is supposed
to be funny.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.600
It's not a joke.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.000
See, I've been making this list
of all the different ways you can die--

04:43.900 --> 04:45.700
self-immolation,

04:45.700 --> 04:47.200
falling from a great height.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.400
I don't know about electrocution.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.700
I hear that your heart actually cooks
and you puke up your melted guts.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.800
All right, Greta, just stop.
Just stop right now.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.100
Well, at the same time,
I've been making this list

04:58.000 --> 04:59.800
of things that I want to do
before I die.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.100
For instance,
I want to eat a bug

05:02.100 --> 05:04.000
just to say that I did.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.600
I want to get in a fistfight
with a grown man.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.900
Don't ask.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.100
I want to learn
how to really paint,

05:11.100 --> 05:13.600
and maybe get a tattoo.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.300
Anyway, as soon as I choose
my method of death

05:16.200 --> 05:19.800
then I'm gonna cross as much off
my to-do list as I can

05:19.700 --> 05:23.400
and commit some kind of
grizzly suicide.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.900
Voilà.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.500
You won't have Greta
to kick around anymore.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.800
Come on, Greta.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.100
Well, look who it is.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.700
You certainly have grown up
to be quite the pretty young lady

05:54.600 --> 05:56.500
under all that makeup.

05:56.500 --> 05:59.700
Mrs. Wocheski,
same nosy old bag.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
What? What's that?

06:01.600 --> 06:04.600
I said, "Isn't this heat a drag?"

06:04.500 --> 06:05.600
A drag?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.000
Hey, did you hear about
that huge hunk of space junk

06:10.000 --> 06:12.300
that landed in some
old lady's home

06:12.200 --> 06:14.400
just about a month ago
right here in Jersey?

06:14.400 --> 06:15.500
Jersey?

06:15.600 --> 06:18.400
( whispering ) The universe is just
loaded with things that we've left up there.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.000
- What?
- And all of a sudden--

06:19.900 --> 06:21.400
- Bam!
- Whaa!

06:21.400 --> 06:23.900
Instantly vaporized.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.200
( barking )

06:26.600 --> 06:29.200
¶ I don't know what to do
about you ¶

06:30.300 --> 06:34.400
I left your things upstairs,
honey.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.400
¶ I learned a lot of rules
from the Bible, baby ¶

06:38.200 --> 06:41.500
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

06:42.300 --> 06:45.300
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

06:46.400 --> 06:50.300
¶ I don't know
why I'm staying with you ¶

06:50.200 --> 06:54.200
¶ If everything they're saying
is true ¶

06:54.100 --> 06:58.300
¶ I heard about you lying
to your mama, baby ¶

06:58.200 --> 07:00.700
¶ And I wonder wonder
what I should do ¶

07:02.200 --> 07:05.000
¶ But I wonder wonder
what I should do. ¶

07:22.900 --> 07:24.900
( cat mewing )

07:24.900 --> 07:27.300
Parnelli.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.300
Hey.

07:30.300 --> 07:33.200
What's it like living with the mummies
of Guanajuato?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.700
Do you ever get used
to that smell?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.000
Hmm?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.900
You don't care,

07:39.800 --> 07:42.400
as long as someone feeds you
and scoops your litter.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.000
It's a pretty good deal,
a life you want anyway.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.000
( teapot whistling )

07:53.600 --> 07:57.000
Katherine: I'm trying not to be
judgmental, Joseph,

07:56.900 --> 07:59.200
but she's a handful.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.700
Joseph: Oh, Katherine,
it's only three months.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.800
September will be here
before you know it.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.200
You don't think
she's serious, do you?

08:07.100 --> 08:10.000
No, I think she's just
being dramatic,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.700
trying to push our buttons.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.900
Yeah, you know who she
reminds me of at that age?

08:14.800 --> 08:16.300
Karen.

08:16.300 --> 08:20.100
Ow. I'm nothing like my mother!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.100
Nothing!

08:33.100 --> 08:36.000
Hey, Gramps,
can I bump a $20?

08:36.799 --> 08:39.100
Mm!

08:39.000 --> 08:41.500
Greta, we have rules
in this house.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.200
I assume your mother
told you about them.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.800
Yeah.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.900
I'm sure she did.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.000
I'm also sure
I wasn't paying attention.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.100
Oh, well,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.200
then listen to me.

08:54.100 --> 08:58.000
Now you can have
a very nice summer here,

08:57.900 --> 09:02.400
but it won't be
without structure and supervision.

09:04.300 --> 09:07.300
Now if you want to have
spending money,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.800
you're going to have to
get a job.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.500
And there will be
a 10:00 PM curfew.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.200
And you're not permitted
beyond the town lines,

09:16.200 --> 09:19.500
especially not to Asbury Park.
That's no place for you.

09:19.300 --> 09:24.300
So does all of that
sound fair to you?

09:29.400 --> 09:31.900
Let me tell you how this works:

09:31.900 --> 09:36.600
I go where I want
when I want with whom I want.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
And I don't come home
until I want to.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Now that's how it works
at Karen's.

09:40.900 --> 09:44.400
So if you've got a problem with it,
take it up with her.

09:44.300 --> 09:47.200
She's the one who dumped me
on you two anyway.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Okay? Let's just do each other
a favor,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.900
stay out of each other's way.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.000
Summer will be over
before we know it.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.300
Deal?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.700
Deal.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.100
( whistles )

10:20.600 --> 10:23.200
Where did you get that?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.800
Oh, yeah.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.800
What does that thing get,

10:29.700 --> 10:32.800
90 yards to a gallon?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.900
Only on a steep downgrade.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.400
Can I borrow it?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.500
Huh-uh. I heard about what happened
when you went to get your driver's license.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.500
That DMV guy
was emotionally unstable, okay?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.900
It was not my driving
that made him cry.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.000
( Joseph guffaws )

10:45.900 --> 10:47.400
I'm serious.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.500
Okay, we'll see
what your mother thinks.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.200
Like she thinks.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.800
I swear she holds the record
for the most blah moments.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.200
She thinks that string theory
has something to do with macramé.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.400
This is the same woman
that gives me advice on boys.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.600
Her husbands are in and out so fast,
I can't even keep track.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.400
What, is this
husband number nine?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.300
Three.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.500
And you can't drive alone
without a license.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.500
It's against the law.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.800
What's the worst
that's gonna happen, Grams?

11:14.700 --> 11:16.000
I die?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.800
No, the worst thing
that can happen

11:17.700 --> 11:19.600
is that you take somebody
with you when you die.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.200
Greta: Ocean Grove.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.400
More like Ocean Grave.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.000
No wonder Mom left this place
when she was 17.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.400
It's so passé.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.200
I'll make her pay for this torture
when I get home.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.900
That is, if I make it home.

11:52.200 --> 11:56.400
Wow. Okay, I'll give it to her--

11:56.200 --> 11:59.000
Grams looked pretty.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.900
( changing channels )

12:57.900 --> 12:59.900
( turns off TV )

13:01.500 --> 13:03.700
( tinkling )

13:13.900 --> 13:15.000
Can I help you?

13:15.100 --> 13:18.300
There's something majorly wrong
with the cable.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.200
I think you ought to call
and light a fire under someone's ass.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.600
We don't have cable.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.700
Wait, say that again.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.100
I said we don't--

13:26.100 --> 13:29.200
What are you wear--?
Oh, look at you.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.600
How do you survive
without cable?

13:32.500 --> 13:34.400
It's really tough, Greta.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.500
Sometimes we cry ourselves
to sleep at night.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.300
You know, you can always
rent videotapes.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.600
Videotapes?

13:43.500 --> 13:47.100
Come on, who lives like this?

13:47.000 --> 13:49.700
Oh, stop the histrionics, Greta,
for goodness' sakes.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.400
There's so much to do
around here.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.300
There's the whole ocean
right there.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.900
Take my bicycle.
Ride along the boardwalk.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.000
Then you won't have time
for TV.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.700
So you want me to sacrifice
reality TV

14:01.600 --> 14:03.900
for purely empirical
experiences?

14:06.100 --> 14:09.100
Yeah, that's my
recommendation.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.400
Fine.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.000
¶ Come with me ¶

14:23.900 --> 14:27.600
¶ Come with me ¶

14:28.900 --> 14:31.300
¶ On a voyage ¶

14:31.200 --> 14:33.600
¶ To the bottom ¶

14:33.500 --> 14:35.900
¶ Of the sea ¶

14:39.900 --> 14:43.300
¶ In a sea ¶

14:44.900 --> 14:49.100
¶Of blue-green ¶

14:49.000 --> 14:51.800
¶ We will find love ¶

14:51.800 --> 14:53.700
¶ At the bottom ¶

14:53.700 --> 14:56.500
¶ Of the sea ¶

15:00.100 --> 15:04.700
¶ Unbelievable, inconceivable ¶

15:05.500 --> 15:09.600
¶ Fantastic it will seem ¶

15:10.700 --> 15:13.100
¶ But we'll be the first ¶

15:13.000 --> 15:15.300
¶ The very first ¶

15:15.200 --> 15:17.900
¶ To live such a strange ¶

15:17.800 --> 15:22.100
¶ New dream ¶

15:22.000 --> 15:25.900
¶ There we'll be ¶

15:25.700 --> 15:29.400
¶ Lost and free ¶

15:29.300 --> 15:33.000
¶ On our voyage ¶

15:32.800 --> 15:35.600
¶ To the bottom ¶

15:35.500 --> 15:38.000
¶ Of the sea ¶

15:37.900 --> 15:39.900
¶ Come with me ¶

15:39.800 --> 15:42.900
¶ On our voyage ¶

15:42.800 --> 15:45.100
¶ To the bottom ¶

15:45.100 --> 15:47.100
¶ Of the sea. ¶

15:47.000 --> 15:49.400
Greta: They say that drowning
and freezing to death

15:49.400 --> 15:52.500
are the nicest ways to die,
euphoric even.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.400
I wonder how they would
know that.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.700
The way I see it, what does
experience have to do with anything?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.900
I mean, I've been served
by 1000 waitresses

16:10.900 --> 16:12.900
and the job just doesn't
seem that tough.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.600
I'm sure it has its nuances
just like anything else,

16:15.600 --> 16:17.000
but I'll figure it out.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.800
You're soaking wet.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.500
Oh, come on, Lou.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.100
I'd say the wet T-shirt look
definitely trumps experience.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.700
Does he have
all of his shots?

16:25.900 --> 16:28.400
Let me get you an application.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.100
What the hell for?
It's a yes or no decision.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.800
Not really. It's--

16:32.900 --> 16:36.100
Hey, Lou, give her the job.
You're gonna give it to her anyway.

16:35.900 --> 16:37.200
Zip it, Julie.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.100
See, this is how it works--

16:39.100 --> 16:41.400
you ask him something;
he pretends to chew on it.

16:41.300 --> 16:45.100
He can't say no to nobody,
so you got the job. Don't worry about it.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.300
I don't need your help.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.800
I ain't trying to help you.
Hell, I don't even know you.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.800
I'm trying to help my boy.
One more night that he's shorthanded--

16:51.600 --> 16:54.600
he's gonna develop an ulcer
and it's gonna be problematic for all of us.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.200
Get back to the dungeon.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.600
I'm just saying, man.
I'm just saying.

16:59.500 --> 17:02.400
I can start tomorrow.
Would you like me here at 4:00?

17:02.300 --> 17:03.400
Um...

17:03.400 --> 17:05.000
Or how about lunch?

17:05.000 --> 17:07.599
Then I can learn everything.
It'll be all good.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.599
Uh...

17:08.599 --> 17:10.599
Great. See you then.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.599
Hey, that girl's trouble.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.500
I think I just hired her.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.099
( chattering, laughing )

17:22.000 --> 17:24.900
Oh my God, you guys
are still awake?

17:24.800 --> 17:27.900
You do realize
it's past 9:00, right?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.800
You realize
that you missed dinner?

17:30.700 --> 17:32.900
What happened to my dress?

17:32.900 --> 17:35.300
Oh, I went swimming.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.300
New York doesn't use that ocean
as a toilet, do they?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.400
Is my hair starting
to turn green?

17:40.300 --> 17:43.300
Greta, I really don't mind
you wearing my dress.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.600
I do mind you going swimming in it.
Would you take it off, please?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.200
Greta, your mother called.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.900
You were supposed to let her know
you got down here all right.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.400
Well, did you tell her
that I was still alive?

17:53.300 --> 17:56.100
Why don't you tell her?
There's a phone on the piano.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.400
- Are you taking that?
- Yes, I am.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.100
- You're in deep trouble now.
- Come on.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.200
- Gin.
- Oh, no.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.100
It's me.
What do you want?

18:06.100 --> 18:08.500
Karen: I see you survived
the bus trip after all.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.200
I'd rather have ferried
across the River Styx.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.000
Grams told me about your little
to-die list.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.000
You shouldn't scare her
like that.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
She doesn't know you well enough
to understand.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.500
How's my old room look?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.600
Does she still have
her seashells everywhere?

18:23.500 --> 18:26.100
It's a shell hole, Mom.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.100
Why are you doing this to me?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.600
Karen: You know why.
We've discussed this.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.000
I am trying
to save my marriage.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.600
You would have better luck

18:36.700 --> 18:39.400
trying to save
the polar ice caps, Mom.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.700
Why is it that your marriage only works
when I'm not there?

18:43.600 --> 18:46.700
Sweetie,

18:46.600 --> 18:50.300
Greta, I know this is tough,
but try to make the best of it.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.400
Take as much time
as you need, okay, Karen?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.500
Sort things out,
shuffle them together,

19:02.500 --> 19:04.400
do whatever the hell it is
you need to do

19:04.400 --> 19:06.300
to try and save
this marriage, okay?

19:06.200 --> 19:09.000
I'm here and I'm fine.
Don't even worry about me.

19:08.900 --> 19:10.400
I'm fine!

19:16.000 --> 19:18.800
¶ Trouble ¶

19:18.700 --> 19:22.300
¶ Oh, trouble, set me free ¶

19:24.500 --> 19:26.500
¶ I have seen your face ¶

19:26.500 --> 19:28.500
¶ And it's too much, too much
for me. ¶

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
Greta: If Dad were alive,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
he'd let me drive the car.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.900
And we'd do stuff like paint.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.900
Maybe I'd be friends
with the kid down the street.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.600
Mom and he would argue
about petunias instead of money.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.700
If Dad were alive,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.000
he'd teach me
how to play the guitar.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.600
If Dad were alive.
If Dad were alive.

19:50.400 --> 19:55.700
¶ I drank your wine ¶

19:55.600 --> 19:59.200
¶ And you have made
your world mine ¶

19:59.100 --> 20:01.400
¶ So won't you be fair? ¶

20:02.700 --> 20:05.100
¶ So won't you be fair? ¶

20:07.800 --> 20:10.800
¶ I don't want ¶

20:10.800 --> 20:13.300
¶ No more of you ¶

20:13.200 --> 20:17.200
¶ So won't you be kind
to me? ¶

20:17.100 --> 20:19.500
¶ Just let me go there ¶

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
¶ I have to go there ¶

20:26.200 --> 20:28.600
¶ Trouble ¶

20:28.500 --> 20:32.300
¶ Oh, trouble, please be kind ¶

20:33.900 --> 20:36.500
¶ I don't want no fight ¶

20:36.400 --> 20:40.000
¶ And I haven't got
a lot of time. ¶

20:42.400 --> 20:44.900
( jazz music playing )

20:57.400 --> 20:59.500
No, I ordered the High Tide.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
The Red Squall is mine.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.200
You expect me to remember
what you ordered?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.100
Figure it out yourselves.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.800
You guys have had plenty of time
to look over this lousy menu.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.200
So what's it gonna be?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.900
Is everybody ready?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.200
- No.
- I think we need another minute.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.400
If I walk away from this table
without an order,

21:21.400 --> 21:23.300
I'm not coming back
for another 20 minutes.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.300
I hope by then
you've got it figured out.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.800
I know what I want.

21:26.700 --> 21:30.300
Yeah? Well, I see
who the decision-maker is here.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.900
What will it be?

21:31.900 --> 21:34.900
I will have the chicken breast.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.700
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:36.600 --> 21:40.500
You come to a seafood restaurant
and order chicken?

21:40.300 --> 21:41.800
Well, the other stuff
is expensive.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.000
That's because it tastes good.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.700
Come on, Stacy,
order the lobster.

21:45.700 --> 21:49.300
You can even pick it out
if you're feeling particularly sadistic.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.600
Do you like shrimp?

21:52.500 --> 21:54.300
We have a spectacular
shrimp cocktail,

21:54.300 --> 21:57.500
if you don't mind ripping apart
their freaky exoskeletons.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.200
They have a lot of cholesterol,
don't they?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.800
Not half as much
as the lobster.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.800
Oh my God.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.000
Listen, you could die
on a car ride home tonight,

22:06.000 --> 22:08.300
and you're worried
about a little bypass surgery

22:08.300 --> 22:10.500
20 years down the road?
Relax.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.100
You're gonna get the shrimp cocktail
and the poached lobster.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.100
Who's next?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.900
Not bad for a kid
learning the ropes.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.300
Welcome aboard, Greta.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.900
Thanks.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.900
Hey, that seafaring lingo
that you do--

22:27.900 --> 22:30.100
you don't do that
all the time, right?

22:30.100 --> 22:33.200
Yeah, I want to see a collar
from now on.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.500
This is a respectable place.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.700
Aye aye, Captain.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.800
Oh my God.

22:41.300 --> 22:45.300
Hey, you got a car?

22:45.200 --> 22:49.300
Seeing as I don't have a license, no.

22:49.100 --> 22:51.500
Yeah, well,

22:51.400 --> 22:53.500
why don't you stick around
a little while?

22:53.400 --> 22:56.000
And I will get you home safely.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.100
Uh, thanks, Voltaire,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.200
but I can take care of myself
all right?

23:02.200 --> 23:05.100
Anyway, I'm only 17.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.600
What, are you, like, 40?

23:11.800 --> 23:13.700
Hey, Lou,

23:13.800 --> 23:16.100
what's a Voltaire?

23:21.900 --> 23:25.200
Does Lou know that you're
feeding his food to the strays?

23:25.100 --> 23:26.300
It's just garbage.

23:26.200 --> 23:29.600
Lou know that you think
his food is garbage?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.700
No, I mean it's going
in the garbage.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.800
It's just a joke.

23:33.800 --> 23:34.900
Hold on.

23:36.300 --> 23:38.800
My name's Julie.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.500
I'm Greta,

23:42.400 --> 23:46.000
which is just a thinly disguised
anagram for "great."

23:45.900 --> 23:48.000
Okay.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.800
You didn't thank me
for getting you hired.

23:49.700 --> 23:52.200
That's 'cause I already
hate the job.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.800
It's only been one day.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.000
( distant siren wailing )

24:30.500 --> 24:32.300
( distant siren wailing )

24:37.400 --> 24:40.400
( car alarm whooping )

24:46.100 --> 24:48.100
What's up, little girl?

24:50.600 --> 24:53.000
( helicopter blades whirring )

24:52.900 --> 24:55.900
- Man: Check this out.
- Man #2: Yeah, look at that.

24:55.900 --> 24:58.800
Hey, slice, like at you.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.900
Baby, can I walk with you?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.100
No.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.400
Oh, she cold.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.700
Yeah, that's right.

25:08.500 --> 25:12.400
( woman singing )

25:12.300 --> 25:14.300
Woman: What are you
looking at?

25:14.200 --> 25:16.500
( men and women arguing )

25:16.400 --> 25:19.100
Man: What did I say?
What did I just say?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.300
Woman: I'm not giving it to you
no matter what.

25:28.500 --> 25:31.000
( siren whooping )

25:47.000 --> 25:49.500
Parnelli.

25:49.400 --> 25:51.800
Where are you?

25:53.300 --> 25:56.000
Parnelli, time to come in.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.800
( police radio chatter )

25:57.800 --> 26:01.100
Parnelli.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.000
Thanks for the ride.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.400
- Stay out of trouble, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.900
Grams, don't worry.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.300
They're trumped up charges.
Jury's got nothing on me.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.400
What?

26:17.400 --> 26:20.200
We found her over
in Asbury Park.

26:20.100 --> 26:22.200
She got a little scared,
so we brought her home.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.200
Oh.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.900
Oh, thank you.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.700
( knocks on door )

26:42.700 --> 26:44.300
What happened?

26:44.200 --> 26:47.900
Come right in, Grams.
Don't bother waiting for an invitation.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.800
Now you see why I told you

26:50.800 --> 26:53.100
to stay away
from Asbury Park.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.400
Well, you piqued
my curiosity, okay?

26:55.300 --> 26:57.600
Oh, I see.
It was all my fault.

26:57.600 --> 26:59.600
If you don't want me
to do something,

26:59.500 --> 27:02.500
don't plant the idea
in my head.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.100
I'm just trying
to protect you.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.700
It's a little late.

27:10.300 --> 27:12.800
I'm really tired, Grams.

27:13.600 --> 27:16.000
Good night.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.600
Good night.

27:24.900 --> 27:25.000
Well, I admit
she's a bit of a challenge, but--

27:25.000 --> 27:27.300
Well, I admit
she's a bit of a challenge, but--

27:27.300 --> 27:28.500
What?

27:28.400 --> 27:31.100
A challenge.
I say she's a challenge.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.000
A challenge?
She's a pain in the butt.

27:35.100 --> 27:37.100
Good morning.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.500
Oh, love,

27:39.500 --> 27:43.900
it seems Greta is giving
Mrs. Wocheski some difficulty.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.300
There's no "seems" about it.
She is.

27:46.200 --> 27:50.500
She said Mr. Poodles
was just a mangy rodent

27:50.500 --> 27:53.700
and not a real dog at all.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.800
And then she said
he looks just like me.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.600
Are you sure you heard her
correctly?

27:57.600 --> 27:58.600
What?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.300
I said I'm sure she meant it
in the sweetest possible way.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.300
Oh, she's a menace,
that girl.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.000
You'd better keep
a sharp eye out.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.200
Well, we'll see to it
that she apologizes.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.200
Won't we, dear?

28:12.100 --> 28:13.200
Are you done?

28:13.200 --> 28:14.500
I wish.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.700
- Well, how much longer?
- Just a bit.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.000
Excuse me, is that
your van outside?

28:18.900 --> 28:21.300
Yes, ma'am.
I'm hooking it up right now.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.900
Well, I didn't order any hooking up,
so you just go ahead

28:23.800 --> 28:26.000
and unhook
whatever it is you hooked.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.500
Grams, I'm paying for this.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.700
That's not the point.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.700
You're gonna love this, okay?

28:32.600 --> 28:34.300
I don't want cable.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.000
Look, I'm almost done here,
so if you don't want this--

28:36.900 --> 28:40.800
Grams, it's guaranteed to keep me
out of trouble the whole summer.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.200
And it's not costing you
a thing.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.300
We've got to send her home.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.400
I can't do it.
I just can't take it anymore.

28:50.300 --> 28:53.100
Oh, honey, so she wants
the cable TV.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
What's the harm in that?

28:54.900 --> 28:58.300
Katherine: That's the point.
She does whatever she wants to do.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.900
She has no boundaries.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.700
Karen's always been
too permissive with her.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.000
Okay, that'll do it.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.200
Finally.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.800
This here is your remote.
What you do is--

29:07.800 --> 29:10.200
Yeah, I got it, okay?
Scram.

29:10.200 --> 29:13.100
All right, just--

29:12.900 --> 29:15.300
I just need a signature here.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.400
- ( flipping channels )
- Ma'am?

29:19.100 --> 29:20.500
Sir?

29:23.100 --> 29:25.800
- I just need a signature.
- Okay, I got it.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.300
- Hey.
- I told Mrs. Wocheski

29:31.300 --> 29:34.300
that you would apologize
for that smart-alecky remark

29:34.100 --> 29:35.300
you made about her dog.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.100
Now please go do it.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.800
I can't believe you would
sell out your own granddaughter

29:39.800 --> 29:41.100
to that old blue-hair.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
It's not even blue
in a good way.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.400
Go.

29:45.500 --> 29:47.300
Now.

30:04.700 --> 30:07.400
We thought we heard
someone at the door.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.600
You ratted me out
to my grandparents.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.500
I most certainly did.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.100
And I believe you owe me
an apology.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.900
You know,

30:18.800 --> 30:21.500
I noticed you keep those windows
pretty much open all the time.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.000
Of course I do.
The breeze is healthy.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.500
Yeah?

30:25.500 --> 30:27.500
What time do you go to bed
around usually,

30:27.500 --> 30:29.800
7:30, 8:00-ish?

30:29.700 --> 30:31.100
What are you getting at?

30:31.100 --> 30:34.200
( chuckles )

30:34.200 --> 30:35.700
You don't scare me.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.700
Mm-hmm.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.200
You don't scare me.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.400
( dog yapping )

30:52.200 --> 30:54.700
( patrons chattering )

30:56.000 --> 30:58.500
Give me just one second here.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.400
Uh, okay.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.400
How's the perch?

31:10.300 --> 31:12.000
How should I know?

31:12.100 --> 31:13.400
I'm sorry?

31:13.300 --> 31:16.100
It's perch.
I'm sure it's fresh.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.200
I'm sure it tastes
how perch usually does.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.800
I can't afford to eat here,
so how should I know?

31:22.700 --> 31:25.100
There's no need to be rude.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.200
Woman: Table 12.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.000
Man: Can I get a side
of horseradish?

31:30.300 --> 31:32.600
What's the perch taste like?

31:32.500 --> 31:34.600
What?

31:34.500 --> 31:36.500
The perch-- how is it?

31:36.500 --> 31:39.700
It's all right,
but the catfish is the business.

31:39.600 --> 31:42.500
Yeah? What's that
taste like?

31:43.700 --> 31:46.400
Are you telling me you've never
tried fish before?

31:46.400 --> 31:47.900
Yeah, I have.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.000
Okay, I'm not talking
out of the box or the can.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.700
What kind of wonk
has never tasted fish before?

31:56.700 --> 32:00.200
Okay, maybe not.

32:00.100 --> 32:02.700
Come around here.
I'm gonna show you what it tastes like.

32:02.700 --> 32:04.200
Come on.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.600
Okay, now this right here
is perch, all right?

32:18.500 --> 32:21.000
Now hold on.
Stay here.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.900
Now this is catfish,

32:25.900 --> 32:29.200
Cajun blackened, okay?

32:29.100 --> 32:30.600
Okay.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.800
It's my favorite.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.400
Mm.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.900
You made that?

32:39.800 --> 32:42.100
Yeah.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.200
Well, that is
surprisingly edible.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.400
Well, I'm glad you like it.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.100
Man: Hey, Julie.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.100
Man #2: I need another special.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.900
You don't want the perch.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.300
What's this?

33:03.200 --> 33:04.400
Catfish.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.400
But I wanted the perch.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.300
No, trust me,
you want the catfish.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.500
The perch is all right,

33:11.400 --> 33:14.000
the catfish is the business.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
( distant siren wailing )

33:30.700 --> 33:33.500
You know, it's really gonna be
really hard for you to ride that bike

33:33.300 --> 33:35.300
with my foot
shoved up your ass.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.400
Wow.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.400
Oh, it's you. I thought you were
these guys from the other night.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.200
- You ever let it down?
- What?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Your force field.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
You know, you walk around
all up in your own shit

33:47.100 --> 33:49.400
like you ain't got no time
for nobody else's goodness.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.100
How does somebody get close enough
to give you what you need?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
I don't need anything.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.700
Everybody needs something.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.500
As of right now, seems like
you might need a ride.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.400
On that?

34:00.300 --> 34:01.800
Yeah.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.700
I don't think two bodies
can fit on that.

34:03.800 --> 34:05.700
What, is it, like,
your little brother's bike?

34:05.700 --> 34:08.300
Okay, let me tell you something
about this right here.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.699
This is a masterpiece
of engineering.

34:10.699 --> 34:13.400
This is the product
of my love and sweat.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.600
And it can and will prove you wrong.
But as of right now,

34:15.500 --> 34:19.300
I don't think I even want
to let you on this thing.

34:19.199 --> 34:23.199
I mean, unless-- and I mean,
only if you promise to be sweet.

34:25.199 --> 34:27.199
Promise.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.400
Are you always
that sensitive?

34:30.300 --> 34:32.300
I mean, didn't your mama
breastfeed you?

34:32.300 --> 34:35.000
Okay, that would be classified
as sour in my kitchen.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.199
But I'm gonna pretend
that didn't happen.

34:38.100 --> 34:40.100
Okay? Come on.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.300
Now you promise
to be sweet, right?

34:53.100 --> 34:55.500
Yeah.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.400
I promise.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.100
¶ She's mine ¶

35:07.100 --> 35:08.900
¶ She's mine ¶

35:10.200 --> 35:12.300
¶ She's mine ¶

35:12.300 --> 35:14.400
¶ All mine ¶

35:14.300 --> 35:17.800
¶ Yeah, she's mine ¶

35:17.800 --> 35:19.800
¶ Mine ¶

35:19.700 --> 35:22.800
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, what's up?

35:24.900 --> 35:26.500
Forget you.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.800
¶ Yes, she's mine ¶

35:49.600 --> 35:52.300
¶ Mine ¶

35:52.200 --> 35:54.600
¶ Yeah, mine ¶

35:56.400 --> 35:59.100
¶ Yeah, she's mine. ¶

36:00.600 --> 36:02.300
She must have been pretty.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.400
Who?

36:03.400 --> 36:05.900
RS.

36:05.700 --> 36:08.600
RS was a he.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.200
No, not like that.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.100
He was a good friend of mine.

36:14.100 --> 36:16.400
Does he have your initials
tattooed on his wrist?

36:16.400 --> 36:17.900
No.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.100
Why not?

36:20.000 --> 36:22.500
'Cause I'm not dead.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.600
( distant train horn whistles )

36:29.000 --> 36:31.200
Is this what you guys do
for fun around here?

36:31.100 --> 36:33.400
I kind of try
not to have fun.

36:33.300 --> 36:36.300
I try to stay working.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.500
I got this great talent
for finding trouble

36:38.500 --> 36:40.900
and getting all up in it,

36:40.800 --> 36:42.800
so I stay busy.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.400
You want to be a chef?

36:46.400 --> 36:49.600
Yeah, I want my own restaurant.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.800
Where did you learn
how to cook anyway,

36:51.700 --> 36:54.200
home ec?

36:55.600 --> 36:58.100
No, prison.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.700
You lie.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.400
No, for real.
I was at juvie.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.000
I was younger then.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.600
What were you in for?

37:07.600 --> 37:10.200
Joyriding.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.800
( harrumphs )
You're full of it.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.000
I mean, it's not something
I'm trying to brag about.

37:16.900 --> 37:19.700
I'm not proud of it.

37:22.100 --> 37:25.500
Stealing cars, huh?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.800
That's joyriding.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.800
But I'm not into that anymore.

37:29.800 --> 37:33.100
So the correctional system

37:33.000 --> 37:34.700
totally corrected you.

37:34.700 --> 37:38.700
Let me tell you something--

37:38.500 --> 37:41.200
it's a miracle
that I'm even on the outside.

37:41.100 --> 37:45.400
Where I'm at--
I did that, you know.

37:45.200 --> 37:48.700
So if I go back--
I did that too.

37:52.500 --> 37:54.000
That's cool.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.100
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.500
But you'd still steal me
a BMW, right?

37:59.400 --> 38:01.800
For you-- anything.
I got you.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.800
I just don't know
why you don't like my BMX.

38:03.700 --> 38:06.800
It's the sickest right here.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.100
Greta: Why do I say
the things I do?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.400
They just come out
totally wrong.

38:14.300 --> 38:18.400
Sometimes I just wish
I wouldn't say anything at all.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.800
I like him.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.700
Narrator:
...hundreds of others.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.500
Interpreter: Handcuffed me, beat me,
denied me food and water.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.700
Narrator:
Palden Gyatso endured

38:36.700 --> 38:39.200
33 years of torture
in Chinese prison camps.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.800
Uh, come on.
We found a show

38:46.800 --> 38:49.700
I'd like to watch.
Let's watch it.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.600
- Morning, ladies.
- ( cell phone ringing )

38:54.600 --> 38:57.000
- Hi, love.
- Hey, Gramps.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.100
You want to go down
to the marina with me today,

38:59.100 --> 39:01.100
help me work on my boat?

39:01.100 --> 39:03.100
I can't, sorry.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.700
I'm gonna hook up
with my friend Julie.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.200
Julie?
You're making new friends already.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.800
Why don't you invite
Julie to lunch?

39:19.500 --> 39:21.400
Okay.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.900
That's a good idea.

39:25.500 --> 39:26.700
Good morning, ma'am.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.600
We're not interested.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.500
Is Greta here?

39:36.800 --> 39:39.700
Hey. Grams, this is Julie.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
How do you do, ma'am?

39:45.300 --> 39:47.600
Everything looks really great.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.400
Thank you.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.100
Julie knows food.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.600
He's a chef.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.200
Really?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.800
No, I'm just a line cook,

39:57.700 --> 39:59.700
but I'm working on
becoming one.

39:59.700 --> 40:03.600
I hope to own
my own restaurant one day.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.400
Why don't you tell them
where you learned how to cook?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
He learned in prison.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.600
He got busted
for stealing cars.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.000
Something the matter, Grams?

40:21.600 --> 40:24.600
So that would make you
an ex-con?

40:24.600 --> 40:27.600
Yeah, but I'm not
that guy anymore, so...

40:27.600 --> 40:30.600
I'm sure. I understand
that a little prison time

40:30.600 --> 40:33.300
totally transforms everyone.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.500
Yeah, well, that's just it,
you know.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.600
All the kids that were
in the juvenile detention center with me

40:38.500 --> 40:41.000
had been in and out of there
a dozen times.

40:42.300 --> 40:45.300
Seeing that helped me realize
you get out the same way you get in--

40:45.200 --> 40:48.200
on your own.
And so I straightened myself out.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.300
Well, good for you.

40:52.300 --> 40:54.600
Of course, it would
have been better

40:54.600 --> 40:56.200
if you hadn't gotten in
in the first place.

40:56.300 --> 40:59.100
You're absolutely right, ma'am.

41:03.300 --> 41:07.800
Is there celery
in this potato salad?

41:07.600 --> 41:09.400
Mm-hmm.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.600
With a little bit
of sweet relish?

41:11.500 --> 41:13.300
Yes, there is.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.800
I thought Mom made
the best potato salad.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.300
I think this got that beat.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.200
( laughs )
It's my mother's recipe.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.200
You mind if I steal it?

41:21.100 --> 41:23.900
Oh, I thought you had
given up stealing.

41:31.100 --> 41:34.300
Julie! Julie, wait.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.500
That was bullshit,
you know that?

41:35.400 --> 41:36.900
How are you gonna put
my business out there

41:36.800 --> 41:39.500
- just to you could scare her?
- It was a joke.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.600
Okay, well, you know what? I don't
like being the punchline of your joke.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.700
What's with you anyway?
Why are you like this?

41:45.700 --> 41:47.800
You didn't think twice
about leaving me out to dry

41:47.700 --> 41:49.300
just so you can school her.

41:49.300 --> 41:52.300
And you know what bothers me even more
than you playing me right now?

41:52.200 --> 41:56.500
You're staring me with those
big, sexy eyes and, you know--

41:56.400 --> 41:58.800
You want to kiss me.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.800
Hell yeah, I want to kiss you.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.800
Yeah.

42:05.000 --> 42:08.200
¶ Do you understand ¶

42:08.100 --> 42:12.200
¶ This might be
the perfect song ¶

42:12.000 --> 42:15.600
¶ Something pure and new? ¶

42:15.500 --> 42:17.400
¶ No more late-night ¶

42:17.300 --> 42:21.700
¶ Television hours ¶

42:21.600 --> 42:24.600
¶ Or sleepless mornings. ¶

42:24.600 --> 42:26.900
You know I'm still
mad at you, right?

42:28.000 --> 42:30.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.400
What's this?

42:32.500 --> 42:34.400
Oh, hey, give me that.

42:34.400 --> 42:35.800
- Let me see.
- It's nothing.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.600
- What is it?
- Julie, give it back.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.000
- Wait, what is that?
- Julie, seriously.

42:39.900 --> 42:42.300
"Learn how to ride
a unicycle."

42:42.200 --> 42:45.800
God damn it.
Come on.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.700
"Become fluent
in the African clicking language.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.100
Create the first gummy museum."

42:51.000 --> 42:53.700
- Seriously, can you give it back to me?
- What the hell is this?

42:53.600 --> 42:55.700
It's just a to-do list, okay?

42:55.700 --> 42:57.900
You want to do all this stuff?
"Lose all my virginity."

42:57.900 --> 43:00.200
- Screw you. Stop.
- It's getting too good right now.

43:02.300 --> 43:04.800
"To die."
Oh, man.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.700
"Get pureed in a jet engine.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.500
Get run over by a back-up.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.200
Skydive nude
with no parachute."

43:12.300 --> 43:14.800
You want to do all this stuff too?
You can't do all this stuff.

43:14.700 --> 43:17.400
Jerk, stop laughing at me.
The one serious thing in my life,

43:17.300 --> 43:18.700
and you're laughing.

43:18.700 --> 43:21.100
Greta, you want to kill
somebody?

43:21.000 --> 43:24.200
Just myself, okay?
Don't worry about it.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.300
You need to stop
talking shit.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.700
I'm not.

43:27.600 --> 43:31.000
I'm not talking shit.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.000
I'm not.

43:37.100 --> 43:39.400
So why do you want
to kill yourself?

43:40.800 --> 43:43.500
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard all day today,

43:43.500 --> 43:45.300
and today has been
straight up retarded.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.500
You know what I think's
retarded?

43:47.500 --> 43:50.000
Wanting to own a restaurant.

43:58.800 --> 44:02.900
Look, I've got one more year
of high school left,

44:02.700 --> 44:04.300
and then what?

44:04.300 --> 44:06.700
Be like my mother,

44:06.600 --> 44:09.000
desperate for companionship?

44:09.000 --> 44:11.900
Or my grandparents?
They're afraid of their own shadow.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.000
They're prisoners
in their own little world.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.400
So you get 16 years
of having a good time

44:16.400 --> 44:19.400
and then 60
running away from death?

44:19.300 --> 44:22.700
Not me.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.000
I'm gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

44:35.100 --> 44:37.700
You have an extremely

44:37.600 --> 44:40.200
extremely cynical look on life.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.200
But you're so lucky.

44:42.100 --> 44:44.700
And you're such a privileged
person, you know?

44:46.500 --> 44:49.200
You should appreciate
what you got good.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.800
That's what I'm doing.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.600
I'm trying to appreciate

45:04.500 --> 45:06.800
what I have good right now.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.900
Hello.

45:40.900 --> 45:44.100
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

45:53.300 --> 45:56.100
Katherine: Do you think
it's a literary reference or what?

45:56.100 --> 45:59.400
- Have you ever heard of that?
- No.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.500
You guys look bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

46:01.600 --> 46:04.500
All right, just don't.
Don't even.

46:04.300 --> 46:06.300
You want some tea?

46:06.300 --> 46:08.500
- No, thanks.
- Katherine: Thank you.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.600
- How is that?
- It's still hot.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.800
I'll say.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.700
Greta, didn't anybody
ever teach you

46:13.600 --> 46:16.500
not to barge into people's rooms
without knocking?

46:16.500 --> 46:18.200
Well, I'm sorry.

46:18.200 --> 46:22.600
I didn't realize
that you guys still do that.

46:22.600 --> 46:27.000
Well, that's a very conventional
point of view, isn't it?

46:26.800 --> 46:29.300
Looks like another
hot one today,

46:29.200 --> 46:31.600
another hot and sweaty one.

46:31.500 --> 46:34.100
That's funny.
I feel perfectly cool.

46:34.100 --> 46:36.800
I know that you guys were
a little preoccupied last night,

46:36.700 --> 46:38.500
but I came home on time.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.800
Congratulations.

46:40.700 --> 46:43.500
Of course, you could have told us
it was your day off.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.100
Well, you could have let me know
it was your day to get off.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.100
Oh, Greta, you just
don't stop, do you?

46:48.100 --> 46:50.700
You just have to push it
as far as you can.

46:50.600 --> 46:54.500
Well, I may not
know much, kiddo,

46:54.300 --> 46:56.800
but I know when it's time
to get out of Dodge.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.100
So where's that old hunk of junk
you've been working on?

47:04.100 --> 47:06.400
You're looking at her.

47:06.400 --> 47:08.400
No way.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.700
Yeah, uh-huh.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.500
That's pretty pimp.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.000
What happened?

47:14.100 --> 47:17.500
You know,
a little elbow grease,

47:17.300 --> 47:19.800
a lot of love,
a lot of patience.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.100
I think it's gonna be
worth the effort, though,

47:22.000 --> 47:23.400
when your grandma sees it.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.100
It's so dope,

47:26.000 --> 47:29.600
definitely the best-looking boat
on the marina.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.100
Thanks.

47:32.300 --> 47:33.600
Didn't you just
have breakfast?

47:33.500 --> 47:35.000
Yeah.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.800
Where are we going?

47:38.700 --> 47:43.600
We're not going anywhere today.
I've got a lot of work to do on this engine.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.400
Fine by me.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.900
I get seasick
watching "Gilligan's Island."

48:06.500 --> 48:08.700
Greta, can I talk to you
for a minute?

48:08.600 --> 48:11.500
Thanks to the Bill of Rights.

48:12.900 --> 48:17.200
This morning your grandmother
found a pill in the toilet bowl,

48:17.100 --> 48:20.700
a little white pill
just stuck there.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.900
And?

48:22.900 --> 48:25.400
You want to tell me
what that's all about?

48:25.300 --> 48:27.800
I haven't spoken to your mother
about it yet,

48:27.800 --> 48:29.400
but I think
I'm gonna have to.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.700
What do you think it is-- Ex?

48:31.700 --> 48:33.200
What?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.700
It's Lexapro.

48:37.700 --> 48:40.200
It's an SSRI,

48:40.100 --> 48:42.600
which means that it's--

48:42.600 --> 48:45.000
I forget what it means,

48:45.000 --> 48:49.100
but it's supposed to make me
normal and boring.

48:48.900 --> 48:50.900
Dr. Glickman put me on it

48:50.900 --> 48:54.500
after I set Edgar's briefcase
on fire.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.600
( chuckles )

48:59.000 --> 49:00.900
What was it doing in the toilet?

49:00.900 --> 49:03.300
I stopped taking it
months ago.

49:03.200 --> 49:07.400
I don't feel right
when I'm on it, you know.

49:07.200 --> 49:09.500
And plus, they say,
"Just say no,"

49:09.500 --> 49:11.700
and then they turn around
and write you a prescription

49:11.600 --> 49:15.400
for some mood-altering drug.
It's so stupid.

49:15.300 --> 49:18.900
Yeah, but if he prescribed it,
maybe you should be taking it.

49:18.700 --> 49:20.600
The only reason
he even wrote the scrip

49:20.600 --> 49:22.700
is because Mom saw
an ad somewhere

49:22.600 --> 49:25.400
and he does everything
that Mom tells him.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.400
Your mother is just trying
to do what she thinks is best for you.

49:28.300 --> 49:29.700
You know, she loves you.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.800
- No, she doesn't.
- Yes, she does.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.300
Then why am I here?

49:35.100 --> 49:37.600
She doesn't know
what do with you, Greta.

49:42.900 --> 49:45.200
You know what?

49:45.100 --> 49:47.200
If the house was on fire

49:47.100 --> 49:50.700
and she could choose
to save me or Edgar,

49:50.600 --> 49:52.700
I think that she'd choose Edgar.

49:54.300 --> 49:56.700
I really think that.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.600
Woman: Hey, Greta,
table 9 wants you.

50:21.900 --> 50:23.400
Hey, remember us?

50:23.400 --> 50:26.400
Yeah.
What do you want?

50:26.300 --> 50:28.800
Well, we don't know. We thought
maybe you could help us decide.

50:28.800 --> 50:32.400
We had a really good time
last time.

50:32.200 --> 50:35.100
Yeah? What am l,
a goddamn sideshow?

50:37.000 --> 50:39.500
What the hell do you want?

50:41.000 --> 50:44.600
Excuse me.
Greta, could I see you?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.100
Thank you.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.500
Look, the attitude was cute
for a while,

50:52.400 --> 50:54.400
but you gotta shape up.

50:54.400 --> 50:56.400
Now I'm gonna put Donna
on that table,

50:56.300 --> 51:00.000
so just take it easy, okay?

51:11.200 --> 51:13.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:13.800 --> 51:16.200
Can we go to the beach later?

51:16.200 --> 51:18.500
Yeah, we can.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.500
But you have to let go of me
so I don't burn anything, okay?

51:35.700 --> 51:37.300
Can I get a refill?

51:37.300 --> 51:40.400
Do I look anything
like your waitress?

51:40.300 --> 51:42.300
Sit down, Greta.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.200
I'm not trying to pick on you,

51:44.200 --> 51:46.900
but you have to treat customers
like what they are.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.000
Thumbtacks in my ass?

51:48.900 --> 51:50.900
No, they're your employers.

51:50.900 --> 51:54.000
They're my employers.
They pay our salaries.

51:55.500 --> 51:58.200
All right.

51:58.100 --> 52:00.500
Do you want to fire me?

52:00.500 --> 52:02.700
You're an unusual girl.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.600
You have more confidence

52:04.500 --> 52:07.100
and self-assurance
than any adult I know.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.500
You can go very far in life.

52:09.400 --> 52:11.700
Except you have this way

52:11.600 --> 52:13.800
of poking people in the eye
with your words.

52:13.700 --> 52:17.900
You know what, Lou? I really
don't need this hassle tonight, okay?

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
I'm being very kind here.

52:19.600 --> 52:22.800
Well, save your charity
for someone who wants it, okay?

52:22.800 --> 52:26.100
If you don't want me working here,
then fire me.

52:26.100 --> 52:29.000
Why don't you take
tomorrow night off?

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Maybe I will.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
I'll take tomorrow night off,
and the next night after that,

52:35.800 --> 52:38.200
and the night after that,
and after that,

52:38.200 --> 52:40.800
and after that,
and then after that one...

52:40.800 --> 52:43.100
( continues ranting )

52:45.500 --> 52:47.500
- Greta, wait.
- I quit.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.400
- Let me just talk to Lou.
- Don't you dare.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.600
I'm sick of wasting my time
in this lousy dump.

52:51.500 --> 52:53.900
It's not that bad, okay?
I'm gonna go in there

52:53.800 --> 52:56.300
and I gotta mop.
It should take 10 minutes. Stay.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.700
No way.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.300
You can meet me
at my house later.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.600
What about your grandmother?

53:02.500 --> 53:04.900
What about
my lousy grandmother?

53:08.600 --> 53:10.600
¶ All I have ¶

53:10.700 --> 53:13.800
¶ Is all that I'm feeling ¶

53:13.700 --> 53:16.100
¶ All I feel ¶

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
¶ Is all that l know ¶

53:19.000 --> 53:21.800
¶ And then I use it
every day ¶

53:21.700 --> 53:23.600
¶ And then I use it
every day ¶

53:24.500 --> 53:28.500
¶ And abuse it
in every way ¶

53:29.300 --> 53:32.200
¶ And that's how ¶

53:32.000 --> 53:34.700
¶ it feels ¶

53:34.600 --> 53:36.800
¶ Yeah, that's how ¶

53:36.800 --> 53:40.400
¶ it feels ¶

53:40.400 --> 53:43.000
¶ I would understand ¶

53:43.000 --> 53:45.700
¶ Your heart ¶

53:45.600 --> 53:50.100
¶ If l could feel it ¶

53:51.100 --> 53:53.000
¶ I would understand ¶

53:53.000 --> 53:55.600
¶ Your heart ¶

53:55.500 --> 53:56.800
¶ If l could feel it.¶

53:56.800 --> 53:58.800
All right.

53:58.700 --> 54:02.400
Julie.

54:02.300 --> 54:05.300
You told me to come over.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.000
- Come on up.
- How am I supposed to get up there

54:07.000 --> 54:10.100
without waking up your grandparents?
Come down here.

54:09.900 --> 54:13.000
I can't.
I'm not dressed.

54:14.500 --> 54:15.600
Climb up.

54:15.700 --> 54:17.600
Hell no.
I ain't climbing up that.

54:17.600 --> 54:20.900
I want to see you.
I want you to come up here.

54:20.800 --> 54:24.100
Please please please
please please.

54:23.900 --> 54:26.800
Look what you got me doing.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.500
( dog yapping )

54:33.400 --> 54:35.500
Shh.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.500
Be careful.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.100
- Hi.
- You're gonna make me kill myself.

54:58.600 --> 55:02.100
¶ Time was sitting still ¶

55:01.900 --> 55:04.000
¶ In a sleepy world ¶

55:03.900 --> 55:07.000
¶ For a pretty girl like you ¶

55:08.300 --> 55:11.100
¶ You can't wait ¶

55:13.200 --> 55:16.100
¶ Ghosts would gather round ¶

55:16.100 --> 55:18.300
¶ To steal a peek ¶

55:18.300 --> 55:21.700
¶ At the secrets
you keep close ¶

55:23.200 --> 55:26.000
¶ At your gate. ¶

55:28.900 --> 55:30.400
What's this?

55:32.500 --> 55:35.900
Well, you know, they are
these balloon thingies

55:35.800 --> 55:39.200
- and two people use them--
- Yeah, I know what they are.

55:40.400 --> 55:44.100
I didn't know what size to get,

55:44.000 --> 55:47.600
so I got Magnums.

55:50.100 --> 55:52.500
We're not about to use this.

55:52.500 --> 55:54.100
Yes, we are.

55:54.100 --> 55:57.100
I mean, it's not gonna be
that way.

55:57.100 --> 55:58.900
We're not about to have sex.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.900
What's wrong?

56:02.800 --> 56:05.100
There's nothing wrong.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.100
That's the problem.
See, I really like you

56:07.000 --> 56:10.400
and I don't want to be one of those things
you check off your to-do list.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.700
You know,
you can't control

56:12.700 --> 56:15.000
every damn thing
that happens in your life.

56:14.900 --> 56:18.600
Some things just gotta have
their own rhythm, you know?

56:18.500 --> 56:20.000
You gotta go with that.

56:20.100 --> 56:22.400
You know what I mean?

56:22.300 --> 56:24.500
So you don't think
I'm gross or anything?

56:24.500 --> 56:27.300
( chuckles ) No.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.400
You're trouble for sure, yeah,

56:30.400 --> 56:34.100
'cause you're hot
and you're sexy and you're smart.

56:48.700 --> 56:52.000
( police radio chatter )

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
- Why are cops here?
- Shit.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Julie.

56:56.900 --> 56:59.400
Julie, wait.
Where are you going?

56:59.400 --> 57:01.700
- I gotta go.
- Julie.

57:01.700 --> 57:03.600
I gotta get out of here.

57:03.600 --> 57:06.300
What are you doing?
Julie, Julie.

57:06.300 --> 57:09.300
Hey, get out of there.

57:09.200 --> 57:12.700
Come on, get down.
On the ground. On the ground.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.200
I didn't do anything.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.800
Shit.

57:15.700 --> 57:19.000
Come on, junior.
Get up, get up.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.100
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

57:21.100 --> 57:23.900
- Wait wait, hold on, hold on.
- Easy now.

57:23.800 --> 57:26.400
Mrs. O'Donnell, you gotta tell them.
They made a mistake.

57:26.300 --> 57:27.900
What's going on here?

57:27.900 --> 57:30.000
A neighbor spotted this individual
climbing up your trellis, ma'am.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.400
- Ma'am, do you know this person?
- Yes, of course.

57:32.300 --> 57:34.300
I thought you were through
with stealing.

57:34.300 --> 57:37.300
I wasn't stealing anything.
It's a mix-up. They made a mistake.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.700
Leave him alone.

57:38.700 --> 57:42.100
Just one second, man.
I didn't do nothing.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Grams, tell them to stop, please.
He's gonna be in so much trouble.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.900
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him here.

57:46.800 --> 57:50.300
- To do what exactly?
- What's going on here?

57:50.100 --> 57:51.700
Gramps, please
make them stop.

57:51.800 --> 57:54.500
Okay, that's it. I've had it.
I'm calling your mother right now.

57:54.400 --> 57:56.900
You're insane.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.700
- Look, he didn't do anything.
- No, back inside.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.900
Joseph: Katherine, don't get Karen
all riled up.

58:00.900 --> 58:03.000
Gramps, they're gonna
take him in.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.700
- I've got to call her mother.
- You have to go tell them.

58:04.700 --> 58:07.100
He didn't do anything wrong.
I promise.

58:07.100 --> 58:09.200
- He crawled through my window.
- Shut up, Grams.

58:09.100 --> 58:11.100
- Don't talk to her that way.
- Please, it's not fair.

58:11.100 --> 58:13.100
You're not helping things.
Now listen to me.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Go upstairs
and let me deal with this.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.500
I will take care of this.
Yes yes, right now.

58:17.500 --> 58:20.100
I will take care of this.
I will deal with it. Go on, go on.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.800
Go on.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.100
Oh, that girl--
she is totally out of control.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I mean, just once
she's got to learn

58:26.000 --> 58:28.400
that she can't have everything
her own way.

58:30.700 --> 58:33.900
She's your family, Katherine.
She's your flesh and blood.

58:33.900 --> 58:37.500
She's not some enemy
you have to defeat.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.700
I apologize for all this,
Mr. O'Donnell.

58:50.600 --> 58:53.200
And I hope I didn't get Greta
in too much trouble.

58:53.100 --> 58:55.400
Thanks.

58:55.300 --> 58:57.800
And I think you got it backwards.
I think she's the one

58:57.800 --> 58:59.400
who got you in trouble.

58:59.300 --> 59:02.200
I like her, you know.
I really like Greta

59:02.100 --> 59:06.100
and she's worth it,

59:06.000 --> 59:08.800
but I'm worried about her,
you know?

59:08.700 --> 59:11.000
Does she ever talk to you about--?

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
She's got that little notebook
she carries around.

59:14.800 --> 59:17.000
Do you--?

59:27.200 --> 59:30.000
Greta ever say anything to you
about her father?

59:29.900 --> 59:33.600
She doesn't talk too much
about personal stuff, you know.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.900
Well, it's something we don't
talk about very much in this family either,

59:36.800 --> 59:39.400
but I think you've earned the right
to know about it.

59:41.300 --> 59:44.700
Greta's father killed himself.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.500
She was just a little kid,

59:48.500 --> 59:50.400
five, six years old.

59:50.400 --> 59:54.100
He took his shotgun
and stuck it in his mouth.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.400
She was there.
She walked in on him.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.200
You know, I don't know

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.200
how much of it
she remembers,

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:06.700
how much
she carries around with her,

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.800
but here she is,
all grown up,

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.200
and writing that list.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.100
You know, it may be a phase
she's going through.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.600
It may be just some idea
that she has to reckon with,

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.100
but I think--

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.700
I think it's our job

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.700
to try and help her
through it.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.100
Wow.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.200
Yeah.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.300
Well, go on home.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.200
Get some sleep.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.600
Thank you, sir.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.900
- Hey, Julie.
- Yeah?

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.500
Do you get seasick?

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.400
¶ If life is like a mountain,
did you, did you not fall? ¶

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.300
¶ I have missed you
since I was five ¶

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.800
¶ I don't recall your eyes,
but your hands I do recall ¶

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:04.600
¶ And I know how you smelled
when you were alive ¶

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.400
¶ You've died ¶

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.800
¶ Like we're all gonna go
someday ¶

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
¶ You've died ¶

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.200
¶ I was five
and I wish you'd stayed ¶

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.200
¶ You've died ¶

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:42.900
¶ I was five
and I wish you'd stayed. ¶

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.500
Yeah, this is great.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.800
I feel all preppy and shit.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.100
Why are we here?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.600
Your grandfather's
a good guy, you know.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.300
This means a lot to him.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:10.300
Come on, it's not that bad,
though, right?

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:14.300
Hey,

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.500
remember that stuff

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.500
that you said in my room
the other night?

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.600
Yeah, I remember.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.700
Did you mean that?

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:24.400
Have I lied to you yet?

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:26.600
I don't know.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.300
Hey, Julie,
want to take the helm?

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.100
Go ahead.

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.400
All right, I'm coming.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.800
Just keep her
in a straight line.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.100
Katherine: I love it.
It's wonderful.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:58.900
¶ Come with me ¶

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:05.300
¶ Come with me ¶

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.000
¶ On a voyage ¶

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.400
¶ To the bottom ¶

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.800
¶ Of the sea ¶

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.500
¶ In a sea ¶

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.800
¶ Of blue-green ¶

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:28.600
¶ We will find love ¶

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.900
¶ At the bottom ¶

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.500
¶ Of the sea ¶

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.800
¶ Unbelievable, inconceivable ¶

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.300
¶ Fantastic it will seem ¶

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.500
¶ But we'll be the first ¶

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.700
¶ The very first ¶

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.700
¶ To live such a strange
new dream ¶

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.100
¶ Come with me.¶

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.200
Greta.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.500
Greta.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.100
There they are.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500
Greta.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.000
I've got you.
I've got you.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.200
Okay, right there, right there.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:08.500
Are you all right?

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400
Yeah. Are you okay?

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:12.300
- Are you okay, honey?
- My head.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.800
You hit your head?
Let me see it.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.600
Turn it.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.700
Joseph: It's not bleeding.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.300
Grams.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.800
Grams.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:27.200
Katherine, Katherine.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.500
Are you all right?

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.000
- Grams.
- I'm gonna get on the radio.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.300
Grams, hey.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.500
( P.A. chatter )

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.900
It was a mild heart attack.
She's okay.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.200
She's gonna have to be
on medication from now on, though.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.100
But she's okay.
They want to keep her here tonight

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:55.800
and run some more tests.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.200
I'm gonna stay with her
until she goes to sleep.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.000
You two go on home,

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.300
get out of this
air conditioning.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:28.400
( thunder rumbling )

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.400
Hey, here.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.300
You're not gonna stay?

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.800
No, you can check me off
that list of yours.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.600
I'm done.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.800
What?

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.100
What are you talking about?

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.500
Are you serious?

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.000
You really don't get it?

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.400
Reggie Spiegel,

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.300
my roommate in juvie.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.600
One morning, Mother's Day...

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.500
I found him hanging
by an electric cord.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.900
I didn't see it coming
'cause he didn't mouth off about it.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.200
He didn't want to be saved.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.200
See, you knew I'd jump in
after you

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.700
'cause you didn't want to die.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.700
You just wanted that drama.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.500
- No, l--
- What you did was serious.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.800
And it affects people.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:49.300
It affects me.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.300
I wish I could help you,
'cause you need it.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.600
But I'm not going
overboard for you.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.900
I got my own shit.
I'm doing my own thing.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.300
You know?

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:02.100
"April 10th, 1962.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.200
My sweet sweet Joseph,

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.000
you set sail
less than an hour ago

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:11.399
and I'm kicking myself already.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.800
Please forgive me.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.100
I only treated you that way

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.899
because I was mad
about you leaving.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.800
I've been silly,

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:24.000
prone to capriciousness.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:27.300
I'm mad at myself

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.100
for wasting our last
moments together,

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.500
for not telling you

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.700
how I really feel.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.300
I love you

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:41.600
and I've missed my chance
to tell you in person.

01:09:41.399 --> 01:09:44.100
If something happens to you,
I'll just die.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.000
I miss you, Joseph.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.899
Promise you'll come home safely.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.200
Forever yours, Katherine."

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.300
Grams.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:50.600
( tinkling )

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.900
Okay, close your eyes.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.300
Katherine: Can I trust you?

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.300
Okay, this way.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Can I open my eyes yet?

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:16.100
Mm, okay.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.000
Oh, you didn't have to
do that, Greta.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.000
Those flowers
are expensive.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.500
Can't you see that I'm trying
to say I'm sorry?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.100
Well, then say it.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.900
I just did.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.500
No.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.400
You don't even know
what you're sorry for.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.200
I'm fighting to save my life

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.400
and you're trying
to throw yours away.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.200
Now why is that?

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.900
'Cause...

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.400
I want to be
like the girl in this picture,

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:06.700
young and alive.

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.100
I haven't seen this picture since--

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.900
I wasn't any older
than you there.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.000
You look like a totally
different person,

01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.800
so happy.
Don't you miss that?

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:21.500
Well, no.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.500
You're telling me
that you wouldn't jump at the chance

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400
if you could turn
the clock back?

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.200
( chuckles ) No.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.700
I wouldn't.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:34.000
You see...

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.000
I was a different person then.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.600
I didn't know anything
about the world or myself.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:45.900
I had no perspective.

01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:51.800
This was a long time ago.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.100
And every day since then,

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.600
every experience I've had,

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.200
every person I've met

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:05.700
has carved an impression on me.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:09.800
You know, this girl, this child--

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:12.700
she's just a fraction
of what I've become--

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:16.300
a wife, a mother,
a grandmother--

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.700
me.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.100
Oh, honey,
you have no idea

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.200
what's ahead of you.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:27.100
It's all such an incredible
adventure.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.300
Do you have a picture of my dad?

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.700
I just want to know
what he looks like.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.800
You've never seen
a picture of your father?

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.600
No.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.900
Sweetheart.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.900
( horn honks )

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.400
What are they doing here?

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.400
Mom.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:07.700
Hiya, all.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.100
Are you okay?

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.800
Shouldn't you be
sitting down or something?

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.700
- I'm fine, dear. Hello.
- I'm so sorry.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.200
What are you doing here?

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.300
Gramps, what are they
doing here?

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.500
Greta, go inside
and get your things.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.000
I don't want to go home
with you.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.800
We're not taking you
home, Greta.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:27.900
Then why are you he--?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.900
You're gonna send me
to that boot camp.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.700
Go get your things, Greta.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.100
Wait a minute.
What's this boot camp stuff?

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:38.700
No, it's a special
summer camp

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:41.200
for kids like her,

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.800
to straighten her out.

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.000
Gramps, why didn't you tell me
that they were coming?

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.000
I asked your grandfather
not to say anything.

01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.000
We didn't want you
running off or something.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.700
- Greta.
- Edgar: Come on now.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600
Karen: Greta.

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.200
My mom is here.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.400
She's gonna send me away
to some boot camp place.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.300
What am I gonna do?

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.600
What can you do?

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:18.000
There's got to be something.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I guess you could
check the camp out,

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.400
see what it's all about.

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:25.200
You think I'm screwed up
and that place is gonna save me?

01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.700
Yeah, you're screwed up.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.700
But that place can't fix you.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.300
Only you can fix you.

01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.300
If that's not what you want,
it ain't gonna happen.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.700
I'm really sorry.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.100
Well, that's a start.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:02.300
- You smell like food.
- Yeah.

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.300
Yeah.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.100
Call me when you get it all
figured out, okay?

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.100
All right.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.000
Have a nice walk?

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.500
Did Mom leave?

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.800
She's here now,
so come on back.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:38.800
You all finished
with your little tantrum?

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.300
What are you doing
with my stuff?

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.500
I packed your things.
You've wasted enough time already.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.900
I don't want to go.
Please, please let me stay.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.900
Your grandmother
does not want you here.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.800
- That's not true.
- That's what you told me last week.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.900
"There's no winning with her,"
you said.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.300
Did I say that?

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.900
Well, that was then
and this is now.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:58.300
And if Greta wants to stay,
I would quite like to have her.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.700
- I'm staying.
- No, you're not.

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.400
- Mom.
- Shh.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.000
- Greta, let go.
- Be careful there. Be careful.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.200
Mom.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.400
- Quiet down and give me the bag.
- What's wrong with you?

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.000
- Greta, stop it.
- Edgar: What's going on?

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:12.600
- Mom, please.
- Stop making a scene.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.300
- Edgar: What are you doing?
- Edgar, I could use some help.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.300
- Be careful. Don't hurt her.
- Come on now.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:18.400
Mrs. Wocheski: What the hell
is going on over there?

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.800
All right, just stop.
Everybody just stop.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.200
( blaring )

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:33.200
Greta, get up.

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.500
Please, Katherine, sit down.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.500
I'm sick of all this.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.700
I'm tired of all this screaming
and yelling and fighting

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:41.600
and the police on my porch
in the middle of the night

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.500
and my wife upset
every 15 minutes.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.700
I don't want to hear
another word

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.200
about this boot camp nonsense.

01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.000
Dad, look,
with all due respect,

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.000
you really don't have
any say here.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.300
Oh, yes, I do.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.500
I earned it when you
dumped her on us this summer.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:00.000
This kid needs love
and understanding and patience.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.100
Do you hear yourself?

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.600
Where was the love and understanding
when I needed it,

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.400
when you let her
run me out of the house

01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:10.100
because she didn't like
my boyfriend?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.900
What? I never threw you
out of this house.

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.200
I simply said you couldn't live here
and do drugs.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.100
You two have a lot of nerve

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.500
bringing my parenting skills
into question.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.900
Stop it.
Mom, stop talking to them like that.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:24.300
Okay, I will go
to the stupid boot camp.

01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:27.600
- No, Greta, Greta.
- Wait wait.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.300
- Greta's staying here.
- Dad.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.600
- And so are you.
- No, I'm not.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.800
We're gonna make this right.
We're gonna fix it.

01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.100
We're gonna get to know
one another, this family of ours.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:40.100
Dad, I have a job.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.100
Well, you've got vacation time
saved up, haven't you?

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.100
Well, yeah, but that's for Bermuda
in the fall.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.700
Oh, you're taking your daughter
to Bermuda in the fall, are you?

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.600
No, just Edgar and l.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.700
Uh-huh.

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:55.600
No, you cannot make Edgar
spend his vacation here.

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.000
Edgar isn't invited.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:59.300
This is between us and you
and Greta.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.700
And if Edgar really loves you,
he can just do without you for a little while

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.100
while you save
your daughter's life.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.800
When you put it like that,
I have to say--

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.000
- You're not gonna leave me here?
- Yeah.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.500
You're leaving me here?

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.400
Yeah, this is the best idea
any of us have had.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.800
You know, I think your dad is right.
This could be good for everyone.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:19.000
- Edgar.
- See you in a couple of weeks.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:21.500
- Edgar.
- You'll be fine, sweetheart.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.700
Oh, this is grand.

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.900
Oh, this is gonna really
be helpful.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.800
Go on, you two, yuck it up.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.300
I don't even have
any clothes to wear.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.500
Grandma's got some dresses
you could wear.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.700
- Edgar: Bye, all.
- You two are exactly alike.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.500
And you--

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.100
Here.

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.500
Here he is.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.400
Oh, yeah, there he is.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.300
He was handsome.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.900
I dream about him sometimes,

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:17.300
but he never looks the same.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.300
You have his eyes.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.000
Yeah?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.900
And his brains.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.800
Well, I'll try to keep mine
inside my skull.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.400
I always loved
that picture of you.

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:44.400
God.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.000
Oh my God.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.300
What happened to your hair, Mom?

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.100
The 1980s.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
It's huge.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:54.900
Katherine:
Big hair. Big hair.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.000
¶ Grow up, girl ¶

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.900
¶ Grow up ¶

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.900
¶ You're not all that you were. ¶

01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:10.100
Greta: Dear Mom,

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:12.300
I'll probably be home
by the time you get this,

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.600
but I don't care.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:17.100
I just wanted to thank you
for the time we had together

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.400
and for letting me
stay down here.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.000
Oscar Wilde wrote,

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.300
"To lose one parent
may be regarded as a misfortune.

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:29.000
To lose both
looks like carelessness."

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:31.300
I think he had a point.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:09.300
It's not so bad here.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.000
Really, it's not as bad
as you'd think.

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:24.000
¶ Nice day for a walk
in the park ¶

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:30.600
¶ Nice day for a drive
through the city ¶

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:37.500
¶ This world is a warm,
sunny park ¶

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.600
¶ Nice day for a talk
with your girl ¶

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.300
¶ Nice day for your shop
to get busy ¶

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:11.300
¶ This world is
of no empty part ¶

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:31.200
¶ Please don't ask me
all those questions ¶

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
¶ I don't know ¶

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.300
¶ Please don't ask me
all those questions ¶

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.800
¶ I don't know ¶

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.300
¶ And when you wake up early
and the sun is shining ¶

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:47.800
¶ Are you ready for
the day that's coming? ¶

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.200
¶ It's coming ¶

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.200
¶ Yeah. ¶
