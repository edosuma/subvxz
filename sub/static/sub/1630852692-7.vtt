WEBVTT

00:06.424 --> 00:08.551
Whitestone.

00:08.551 --> 00:10.720
Mined from our very mountains,

00:10.720 --> 00:13.973
its plain appearance
belies an exceptional trait.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.601
When refined,
it is known by another name.

00:17.685 --> 00:20.062
Residuum Glass,
Professor Anders.

00:20.146 --> 00:22.690
Correct as always, Percival.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.193
Residuum is a potent
arcane amplifier.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.030
Take this delicate Lambent Crystal,

00:30.114 --> 00:31.198
for instance.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.123
Ugh. Cass!

00:39.123 --> 00:40.499
Cassandra.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.170
Are you volunteering
to demonstrate?

00:44.295 --> 00:47.965
Um, certainly, Professor.

00:49.967 --> 00:53.220
On its own,
the light remains measured.

00:53.304 --> 00:56.974
However, when even a tiny bit
of Residuum touches it...

01:01.771 --> 01:03.814
You're not endangering
the heirs of Whitestone,

01:03.898 --> 01:05.649
are you, Professor?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.693
No, of course not, my lord.

01:07.777 --> 01:11.989
Merely relaying the import
of its most valuable commodity.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.618
Do keep the children
in one piece if you can?

01:15.618 --> 01:17.995
Childr...
yes.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.499
I-If I may,
I still have not received word

01:21.624 --> 01:24.084
on my refinery proposal.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.920
Anders, we've been over this.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.130
Yes, but with enough funding,

01:28.214 --> 01:31.300
we could triple
our Residuum production.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.552
Your ambitions
cloud your duties!

01:35.971 --> 01:38.349
More is not always better.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.142
Perhaps focus on your pupils

01:40.226 --> 01:42.269
instead of matters
beyond your purview.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.231
Oh, forgive my hubris.

01:45.231 --> 01:47.608
Your advice
is always illuminating.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.777
See you
at dinner, dears.

01:51.487 --> 01:53.572
Ugh, why do I bother?

01:53.656 --> 01:55.991
No one appreciates me.
No one at all.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.577
Professor,
it's just an experiment.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.454
Not to me!

02:00.538 --> 02:02.915
You'll never appreciate
the potential here.

02:02.915 --> 02:07.711
How could you, when everything
is given and nothing is earned?

02:09.713 --> 02:12.550
Fanciful whelps.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.845
Pray you never wake
to find reality

02:15.845 --> 02:18.138
knocking at your door.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.550
Spread word
of our escape.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.636
Rendezvous in the morning.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.571
Time to start
talking, Percival.

03:57.655 --> 04:01.116
- The fuck happened back there?
- I assure you, I'm in control.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.661
Oh, were you in control
when you pointed that at me?

04:03.661 --> 04:06.580
- I saw your eyes.
- The pepperbox is a potent tool.

04:06.664 --> 04:09.833
I-I may have gotten
carried away.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.878
Oh, I swear, if you turn
that thing on any of us again,

04:12.962 --> 04:14.713
I will not hesitate.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.715
I will kill you.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.762
Percy, holding that weapon,

04:21.762 --> 04:23.889
it's like you're
a different person.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.141
What is it?

04:30.521 --> 04:35.025
When we came here, darling,
you promised no more lies.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.653
You owe us the truth.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.239
You're right.

04:40.239 --> 04:43.075
The creation of the pepperbox
begins five years ago.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.708
<i>With my family murdered,
I had no way of striking back.</i>

04:52.501 --> 04:55.671
<i>So I did the only thing I could.</i>

04:57.256 --> 04:59.091
<i>I fled.</i>

05:03.220 --> 05:05.222
Washed away to a new life.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.311
<i>I feared the de Rolo name
was a death sentence,</i>

05:11.395 --> 05:13.981
<i>so I disappeared.</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:16.859
<i>Wandering aimlessly,</i>

05:16.859 --> 05:19.945
<i>my days spent
struggling for survival.</i>

05:23.949 --> 05:26.368
<i>My nights filled with fear,</i>

05:26.452 --> 05:28.120
<i>blood...</i>

05:28.120 --> 05:29.913
<i>and cruel nightmares.</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:37.087
<i>These unrelenting visions
of my family's end.</i>

05:37.171 --> 05:39.965
<i>I worried I would
go mad from grief.</i>

05:41.675 --> 05:45.137
<i>The hatred inside me grew.</i>

05:46.472 --> 05:49.141
<i>Vengeance burning hotter
than black powder.</i>

05:49.141 --> 05:50.976
<i>Nearly consuming me.</i>

05:57.399 --> 05:58.817
<i>Until the new vision came.</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:04.031
<i>A spawn of science
that would bring me</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:07.117
<i>the revenge
I so desperately sought.</i>

06:11.330 --> 06:13.540
<i>I dreamt of a machine</i>

06:13.624 --> 06:16.627
<i>that would tip the scales
of fortune in my favor.</i>

06:16.627 --> 06:19.588
<i>I dreamt of this.</i>

06:24.051 --> 06:26.303
Yikes. No wonder he's single.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.097
Not the time, Scanlan.

06:28.097 --> 06:30.015
Do you normally build
instruments of death

06:30.099 --> 06:31.809
you find in dreams?

06:31.809 --> 06:34.228
Not the first time
I've been inspired.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.938
Does it matter
where it came from?

06:35.938 --> 06:37.940
At the moment?
Yes, I'd say it does.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.275
Sun Tree?

06:43.487 --> 06:45.447
What happened to you?

07:08.554 --> 07:10.722
You're so weak.

07:21.150 --> 07:24.027
Yeah, look, don't get me wrong,
that thing's badass.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.071
But what are those
scribbles for?

07:26.155 --> 07:27.698
The monsters I hunt.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.366
Professor Anders,

07:29.366 --> 07:32.244
<i>Anna Ripley, the Briarwoods,</i>

07:32.244 --> 07:37.291
<i>and until about an hour ago,
Kerrion Stonefell.</i>

07:38.917 --> 07:42.462
In my dreams I swore to make
a list of those who wronged me.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.881
Swore to who?

07:43.881 --> 07:45.507
Hold up, that's five names.

07:45.591 --> 07:46.884
Who's the sixth barrel for?

07:46.884 --> 07:49.720
- Uh... no, no, no.
- Huh?

07:49.720 --> 07:50.846
Uh, fire.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.442
Is that ale?

08:03.442 --> 08:06.195
You told me they was all empty!

08:06.195 --> 08:08.238
- Guess there was one left.
- Uh...

08:08.322 --> 08:11.491
Must not kill Vax.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.536
I-I'm so sorry.
The Sun Tree was...

08:14.620 --> 08:16.205
I-I thought maybe
that sunlight could...

08:16.205 --> 08:19.041
Inside? Why not just announce
where our hideout is

08:19.041 --> 08:21.919
- while you're at it?
- All right, you made your point.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.754
It was an accident.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.380
Hate to interrupt,
but this is bigger

08:25.464 --> 08:27.925
than all your personal shite.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.348
We have a real chance
at reclaiming Whitestone here.

08:34.348 --> 08:35.891
Are you sure
you want to?

08:35.891 --> 08:39.019
I mean, this town
ain't even got any ale.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.105
Aye, we've seen
our share of dark days.

08:42.189 --> 08:46.610
But Percival de Rolo
is back from the dead.

08:46.610 --> 08:50.155
If that won't inspire
the people, nothing will.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.740
Sorry, Archibald.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.743
Right now I'm only thinking
about my sister.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.246
Ugh. Guess they're
a close-knit family?

08:57.246 --> 08:59.623
- Eh? Know what I'm saying?
- Shut it.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.418
I know you're eager
to rally the troops,

09:03.502 --> 09:05.545
but Cassandra's my only family.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.047
I have to find her.

09:07.047 --> 09:13.011
Percy, old friend,
I reckon we can do both.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.140
<i>The noble de Rolo residences.</i>

09:17.224 --> 09:19.977
<i>Once symbols of the connection
between your family</i>

09:19.977 --> 09:21.687
<i>and their people.</i>

09:21.687 --> 09:24.982
<i>Now the Briarwoods hand them
out as prizes to their cronies.</i>

09:24.982 --> 09:27.359
<i>Stonefell got one.</i>

09:27.359 --> 09:29.820
<i>Their enforcer Duke Vedmire</i>

09:29.820 --> 09:31.738
<i>lives in the one
we passed earlier.</i>

09:33.031 --> 09:35.867
And right there,
Professor Anders.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.745
My scouts got word
he's holding the Kestrel here.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.747
Cassandra.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.208
- Then what are we waiting for?
- Hate to burst your bubble,

09:43.292 --> 09:45.210
but we can't just stomp
through the front door.

09:45.294 --> 09:48.672
There's a million guards
and we'll die a thousand deaths.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.632
Um, is that a lot?

09:50.716 --> 09:54.261
She's right.
We've tried and failed before.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.180
Cassandra is the Briarwoods'
prize hostage.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.599
Freeing her would be
a massive blow.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.685
The whole city
would take up arms.

10:01.685 --> 10:04.563
Ooh, ooh! What if I lure
the guards away from the house?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.940
Yeah, good one.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.484
Come on. Real ideas only.

10:09.568 --> 10:12.070
I could shape that tree in
the back into a sort of ladder?

10:12.154 --> 10:14.281
Nope. Just scouted it.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.074
Even more guards
posted in the back.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.952
Yeah, but there wouldn't be
if I made them leave.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.620
Seriously.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.457
How do you come up
with these jokes so fast?

10:23.457 --> 10:26.543
Scanlan, please.
Now is not the time to be cute.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.712
I am not cute. I mean, I am.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.130
Extremely.
But not like you mean it.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.798
Listen, I'm serious.

10:31.882 --> 10:35.010
I can create a distraction
while you save Percy's sister.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.804
That would have to be
an enormous distraction.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.098
Yeah, and you're tiny.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.017
Well, then I'll pick
a big target.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.894
- T-That bruiser. Venkman.
- Vedmire.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.980
Yes, I'll burn down
his motherfucking house.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.900
A fire that big would be seen
across Whitestone.

10:49.900 --> 10:53.195
The answer is no.
It's far too dangerous.

10:53.195 --> 10:56.156
And you're far too... you.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.033
Grog and I will go.
I'm much better at this.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.660
No. You're the
stabby-kill-kill guys.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.538
I can do this alone.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.665
- I've got these potions.
- Which do what again?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.292
No idea, but it doesn't matter.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.419
Look, I'm a master distractor.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.381
My songs, my jokes, my... me.

11:12.381 --> 11:14.508
Vex, you're always
saying I'm annoying.

11:14.508 --> 11:19.304
- Hmm.
- Well, let me be annoying.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.559
If there's trouble,
we can't help.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.603
Ah, don't worry about me.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.564
I know exactly what I'm doing.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.820
What the fuck am I doing?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.238
Ooh, I'm a master distractor.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.407
Ooh, I'm gonna burn his house
down. Ugh. Moron!

11:38.407 --> 11:42.244
Whew. Okay, come on, come on,
come on, you got this.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.454
No one ever suspects the
Scan-man. Right?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.331
Right? Yeah, right.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.548
What the hell was that noise?

11:57.509 --> 11:58.885
Come on.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.433
<i>Hoppin' walls like a cat ♪</i>

12:04.433 --> 12:05.434
Ugh! Oh!

12:07.811 --> 12:10.981
<i>Totally meant to do that ♪</i>♪

12:13.733 --> 12:16.611
Scanlan's hand!

12:21.575 --> 12:23.869
<i>Gonna prove Vex wrong ♪</i>

12:25.954 --> 12:29.624
<i>♪ Unless fucking rain
comes along</i> ♪

12:29.708 --> 12:32.627
Hmm.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.388
Oh, shit.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.682
Oh, shit.

12:47.309 --> 12:50.604
Trespasser!
It's one of them!

12:50.604 --> 12:53.899
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!

12:56.568 --> 12:59.279
- He went that way!
- Through that door!

12:59.279 --> 13:00.655
- Locked. Locked.
- Move it, move it!

13:00.739 --> 13:02.574
Fucking lock... Ugh!

13:02.574 --> 13:04.493
Roll to see if he... Huh?

13:04.493 --> 13:07.078
Uh... hi.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.959
Gentlemen, to your health.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.506
No? Yeah, I really thought
that would do something.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.136
Oh, hell yes.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.733
Uh, you know what, lemme just...

13:36.733 --> 13:39.069
Uh-oh.

13:41.947 --> 13:43.949
Potion number two.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.453
How would
this ever help?!

13:48.537 --> 13:50.664
Loathsome measle!

13:59.673 --> 14:02.133
Missed me, Dukey.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.804
Ah!

14:10.308 --> 14:12.978
Yeah, yeah.
Vax is way better at this.

14:12.978 --> 14:16.565
Okay. Last one.
Please be something good.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.320
Fuck.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.448
So... what misguided ambitions

14:25.532 --> 14:29.494
delivered this miniature parcel
to my abode?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.997
Yeah, uh,
funny story actually.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.040
I thought this was
74 Whitestone Drive,

14:34.124 --> 14:35.875
But it must be
74 Whitestone Aven...

14:40.297 --> 14:41.881
More jokes.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.676
I strung children's corpses
from a tree,

14:44.676 --> 14:48.305
but I promise you,
you will suffer worse.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.154
Get away!
Everybody run!

15:04.154 --> 15:05.989
Wow, that was convenien...

15:11.870 --> 15:14.289
Thinking about
your sister?

15:14.289 --> 15:16.249
Is it that obvious?

15:16.333 --> 15:20.837
She was 13 when you last saw
her, right? Such a sweet age.

15:20.837 --> 15:24.090
She was a nightmare.
Always got me in trouble.

15:24.174 --> 15:26.051
Terminally irritating, pompous,

15:26.051 --> 15:29.179
utterly incapable of silence.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.681
She sounds like Scanlan.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.100
They're not entirely
different, no.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.313
I hope she's okay.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.233
Scanlan, too.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.449
Open!

15:49.449 --> 15:50.617
Aah! Oh, fuck, ah!

15:50.617 --> 15:52.827
Put your back into it!

15:52.911 --> 15:54.871
Break it down!

15:54.871 --> 15:58.625
Ugh. Ugh...

15:58.625 --> 16:01.753
This guy's weirder than me.
Huh?

16:01.753 --> 16:06.216
Oh. Westruun, Fort Daxio, Emon.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.884
What are these psychos
playing at?

16:07.884 --> 16:09.135
Help me
with this door!

16:09.219 --> 16:10.679
And you, put out that fire!

16:10.679 --> 16:12.555
Oh, shit. Okay, uh,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.432
- no, no, no.
- Give me some room!

16:14.516 --> 16:15.850
Tempting, but not the
right time.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.852
It's almost there!

16:17.936 --> 16:19.479
This scroll.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.022
I've read this stupid thing
a hundred times.

16:22.691 --> 16:26.277
But I've never sung it.
Huh. Okay, fuck it.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.029

16:31.074 --> 16:35.328

16:36.371 --> 16:39.457
I'll filet you and use
your bones for... Huh?

16:46.131 --> 16:47.215
Not bad.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.353
Normally I hunt beasts
in their domain.

17:02.981 --> 17:04.858
This should be interesting.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.534
Whoa!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.662
Doors are such bullshit.

17:17.746 --> 17:20.915
Heh, not bad. I should
remember that spell.

17:24.794 --> 17:25.879
Hmm.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.592
Now for my grand exit.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.678
W-W-Whoa...

17:33.762 --> 17:36.181
Oh.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.267
Or not.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.811
Going somewhere?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.441
Had a busy evening, little man?

17:47.484 --> 17:49.652
You're a tiny maggot.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.740
But your head will still mount
nicely on my wall.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.537
Darling.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.831
Scanlan's probably three-deep

18:01.915 --> 18:03.291
at a brothel right now.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.835
Who let that sex-crazed gnome
do this solo?

18:05.919 --> 18:08.087
Um, you?

18:08.171 --> 18:11.257
Never listen
to me again.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.301
That's it. I'm calling it.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.761
You're just going in?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.680
The longer we wait, the more
we risk being discovered.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.182
On my shot, we move.

18:19.182 --> 18:22.352
Let's not be rash, Percy.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.854
Holy shit. He did it.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.482
And it looks like
he went all-out.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.944
Oh, yeah, he's into
dat freaky stuff.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.572
Excellent plan, Vox Machina.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.700
I mean... that is
what we're known for.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.287
I'll rally the rebels.
When you have her, send a sign.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.499
And, Percy, try not to get
yourself killed.

18:44.499 --> 18:48.419
I was dead yesterday, remember?
Can only improve from here.

18:48.503 --> 18:49.629
Hmm.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.724
Looks clear inside.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.562
Hold on. There could be a trap.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.816
Not everything's a trap,
you twit.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.276
Let's do this!

19:13.027 --> 19:14.112
Uh...

19:15.238 --> 19:16.239
It's a trap.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.839
Oh, wait.
Please, please...

20:00.450 --> 20:01.993
You good, buddy?

20:01.993 --> 20:05.705
Oh, man.
They are fucked now.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.756
Come here!

20:22.472 --> 20:24.349
Anders.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.897
Did you honestly think
you could best me by yourself?

20:35.944 --> 20:38.488
I'm afraid this performance
is over.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.865
You're weak. You're small.

20:40.949 --> 20:45.244
And in this world,
that means you lose.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.538
Wait, wait, wait.
It's true.

20:47.622 --> 20:52.085
I'm all talk.
Everyone thinks I'm a joke.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.212
But the brothels have
taught me one thing:

20:54.212 --> 20:56.631
size doesn't matter.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.675
It's how you use it.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.362
Fucking little cunt.

21:19.362 --> 21:21.990
You been an annoying
piece o' shite.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.412
And you've been
a lovely audience.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.666
And don't forget
to tip your server.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.920
Good show, Scanlan.

21:36.004 --> 21:36.963
Aah!

21:47.557 --> 21:48.641
Anders!

21:50.435 --> 21:52.520
Open the door, coward!

21:59.277 --> 22:01.237
Cass?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.324
Percy?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.535
Always early to class, Percival.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.871
Release her, Anders.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.039
That's an order!

22:11.039 --> 22:12.582
An order?

22:12.582 --> 22:16.502
You de Rolos
were always so entitled.

22:16.586 --> 22:21.299
My new employer encourages me
to make my own decisions.

22:21.299 --> 22:24.260
If you harm her, I will end you.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.971
Let her go
and we can discuss a future

22:27.055 --> 22:28.347
where you're still breathing.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.724
Oh...

22:29.724 --> 22:32.643
you seem to think
this is a negotiation.
