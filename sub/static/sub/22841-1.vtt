32:14.182 --> 32:16.392
not a Candlelight Sit.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.102
The tree lightingis up the street.

32:18.144 --> 32:19.020
Come join us.

32:19.062 --> 32:21.731
A little Christmaswon't kill you, son.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.650
I just told him the same thing!

32:23.691 --> 32:24.567
Great minds.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.903
Mm-hmm.

32:26.944 --> 32:29.155
Merry Christmas, everyone.

32:29.155 --> 32:31.282
What a beautiful evening.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.868
We have lit up the streets,

32:33.910 --> 32:35.787
and now it's timeto light up the tree!

32:35.828 --> 32:37.789
[crowd cheering]

32:38.831 --> 32:40.541
Grace Long, come on up here.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.669
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:42.835 --> 32:45.546
give Gracea huge round of applause.

32:45.588 --> 32:46.673
[crowd cheering]

32:46.714 --> 32:47.590
[Grace]: Thank you.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.758
[quietly] Would you liketo do the honors?

32:49.175 --> 32:51.010
I mean, you deserve itfor getting Tom's son here.

32:51.010 --> 32:52.470
Oh, well,

32:52.512 --> 32:54.138
I didn't,'cause he's not doing it.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.556
[chuckles] Oh...What?

32:55.598 --> 32:56.933
When were you goingto tell me this?

32:56.974 --> 32:58.935
I was goingto tell you tomorrow.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.978
So, who's doing it?

33:00.019 --> 33:01.980
I'm still looking.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.690
Well, my Clint could do it.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.691
He's available.

33:06.859 --> 33:07.860
I mean, you know that.

33:07.860 --> 33:08.861
What are you saying,

33:08.861 --> 33:10.321
Clint's not capableof doing this?

33:10.363 --> 33:13.074
No. No, no,not at all.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.325
Okay, if I can't finda professional,

33:14.367 --> 33:16.119
then Clint's in the suit.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.496
But he has to havea crash course with Tom.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.288
Okay.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.540
He's wonderful!

33:20.540 --> 33:21.416
Yeah. Great. Yeah.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.542
He's just goingto be amazing.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.710
He's got such a waywith people.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.002
Okay.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.046
Okay, great, uh...

33:27.046 --> 33:28.131
All right, everyone.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.465
Ready? Here we go!

33:29.507 --> 33:31.509
[all counting together]Five! Four!

33:31.551 --> 33:33.177
Three! Two!

33:33.219 --> 33:34.721
One!

33:34.762 --> 33:36.597
[cheering]

33:37.390 --> 33:38.558
[groans of disappointment]

33:38.558 --> 33:39.726
Oh.

33:44.397 --> 33:46.858
[Grace]: It's all right,we'll fix it...

33:51.195 --> 33:52.697
Okay, let me try that.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.367
[crowd cheering]

34:00.038 --> 34:01.706
Merry Christmas, everyone.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.252
[mutters] Well, at leastI taught him something.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.962
Tom, leave him be.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.213
I was secretly hopingthat maybe--

34:09.255 --> 34:10.214
I know.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.925
Well, it's getting late,

34:12.925 --> 34:15.011
so we'll be headingback to the house.

34:15.052 --> 34:16.888
What? It's 5:30.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.056
We're old.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.183
I'd like to stay.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.934
--But, uh--

34:21.934 --> 34:23.936
[yawning]--I'm so tired!

34:23.978 --> 34:26.856
Because I'm, uh, old,

34:26.898 --> 34:27.899
and, um...

34:27.940 --> 34:29.025
See you in the morning?

34:29.067 --> 34:29.984
Okay.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.402
And you're stayingat the house, right?

34:31.444 --> 34:34.030
Yeah, but I'm going to beleaving at dawn.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.072
You're notgoing to stay

34:35.114 --> 34:36.199
for Christmas?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.408
Mom, I'm sorry,

34:37.449 --> 34:38.951
Christmas is the busiesttime of year in Boston.

34:38.993 --> 34:40.453
A lot of peopleneed rides.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.163
I'll come back soon.I promise.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.165
Keep that arm elevated, Dad.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.042
I'll see youat the house later, okay?

34:47.418 --> 34:48.878
-Goodnight.-Goodnight.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.920
Good night.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.672
I guess we'llreturn these.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.382
So you're reallyleaving in the morning?

34:54.425 --> 34:55.927
If I leave early enough,

34:55.967 --> 34:57.053
I can beat the traffic.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.013
Okay, well then,I'll go with you.

34:59.055 --> 34:59.972
Why?

35:00.014 --> 35:01.641
Because my caris kinda still there.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.850
What?

35:02.892 --> 35:04.185
You told me you took the train.

35:04.227 --> 35:07.313
Oh, yeah, well, I totally liedto save the parade.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.981
But since you'regoing back so early,

35:08.981 --> 35:09.816
I can go with you,

35:10.024 --> 35:11.651
and get backin time for the parade.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.069
I'll even pay you.

35:13.110 --> 35:13.986
Okay?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.071
No, that's...

35:16.239 --> 35:19.200
I'll drive you.I'll take you free of charge.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.535
Thank you.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.495
No problem.

35:22.495 --> 35:23.746

35:23.788 --> 35:24.831
Good night.

35:24.872 --> 35:25.957
'Night.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.547
[♪♪]

35:36.259 --> 35:38.469
>Come on, Ben, think...

35:40.805 --> 35:43.516
[typing]

36:17.633 --> 36:20.720
"10 ThingsYour Driver Won't Tell you:

36:20.720 --> 36:23.472
Rideshare Etiquetteby Ben White."

36:33.190 --> 36:35.484
Okay, my ride is here.

36:35.526 --> 36:36.986
He can't cometo the door?

36:37.028 --> 36:38.154
Not very gentlemanly.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.155
It's not a date.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.364
It could be.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.909
I will be backsoon enough, okay?

36:42.909 --> 36:43.868
If anyone comes in

36:44.118 --> 36:45.328
who remotely looks likea better Santa than Clint,

36:45.369 --> 36:47.038
please lock themin the storeroom.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.206
You're joking, right?

36:48.247 --> 36:49.916
Of course I am.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.167
--Ish.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.044
At least slap onsome lip gloss

36:53.085 --> 36:54.337
before you go.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.213
I will see you later,Caroline.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.215
Bye!

36:59.634 --> 37:01.260
[quietly]It's totally a date.

37:15.399 --> 37:19.445
You know, I read your articleabout Uber drivers.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.989
It's not going to stop mefrom changing the radio station.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.242
Clearly.

37:28.788 --> 37:32.291
You're a reallygood writer.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.752
So you looked me up, huh?

37:34.794 --> 37:36.212
Creepy.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.341
Okay, I looked you up, too.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.219
Your family really changedGreen River for the better.

37:44.887 --> 37:46.013
Yeah.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.765
They were pretty amazing.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.978
I'm sorry you lost themso young.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.313
Thanks.

37:54.313 --> 37:57.566
It's always harderthis time of year.

37:58.442 --> 37:59.485
Wow.

37:59.527 --> 38:02.280
Since when was snowin the forecast?

38:02.321 --> 38:03.781
I thought it was justsupposed to rain.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.117
[radio]: --With an unexpectedly cold storm front,

38:06.158 --> 38:09.495
meteorologists now expect white-out conditions on I-95

38:09.495 --> 38:11.330
from Hartford to Boston

38:11.330 --> 38:13.582
from now until tomorrow morning.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.126
What do you thinkwe should do?

38:15.167 --> 38:16.836
We need to get off the road.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.342
So where are we now?

38:23.384 --> 38:26.846
Uh... Worcester, Mass.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.723
We're halfway betweenBoston and Green River.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.850
They're gonna be closingthe roads on both sides.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.768
But the parade isin less than two days!

38:32.810 --> 38:35.104
I have to get backfor the final preparations.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.772
I don't knowwhat to tell you.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.150
How aboutwe go back in time,

38:39.191 --> 38:40.818
and you tell me,"Hey Grace,

38:40.860 --> 38:41.986
"there's a chanceof snow today,

38:42.069 --> 38:44.030
so you probably shouldn'tcome down to Boston."

38:44.030 --> 38:45.197
Really?

38:45.197 --> 38:46.198
Did you not hear

38:46.240 --> 38:47.658
the "unexpected"part of the forecast?

38:48.868 --> 38:50.161
Look, there's no waywe're gonna make it back now.

38:50.202 --> 38:51.579
We have to figure outwhere to go,

38:51.620 --> 38:53.331
and we can'tstay in the car.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.291
You know what,

38:55.333 --> 38:56.625
one of my best friendsfrom way back

38:56.667 --> 38:57.626
lives near here.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.462
I can see if we crashat her house

38:59.503 --> 39:00.838
till the worstof the storm is over.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.257
I doubt she'll want somestranger in her home.

39:03.299 --> 39:04.925
Any friend of mineis a friend of hers.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.864
Beautiful, right?

39:35.122 --> 39:36.749
Come on.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.212

So happy to see you!

39:43.672 --> 39:45.466
How are you guys?So great to see you.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.343
It's been a long time.Good to see you again.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.011
-Hi.-Hi. Ben.

39:49.053 --> 39:49.887
Oh, my goodness,

39:50.054 --> 39:51.347
and who has replacedTucker and Alyx

39:51.389 --> 39:52.389
with these gigantic children?

39:52.431 --> 39:54.016
I'm not a giant.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.559
I'm a mech.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.394
It's a gigantic robot

39:57.436 --> 39:58.604
you climb insideand fight with.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.481
So wait, are youone robot,

40:00.523 --> 40:03.109
or a bunch of robotscombined into a Megabot?

40:03.109 --> 40:05.694
I'm definitely a Megabot!

40:06.445 --> 40:08.489
[whispering]Is he your boyfriend?

40:08.531 --> 40:09.657
No.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.660
No, he's...just a friend.

40:12.701 --> 40:13.702
Everyone, this is Ben.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.621
The storm isreally coming down.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.706
Let's get you guys inside,come on.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.086
Come see our tree.

40:24.713 --> 40:28.092
[Grace]:Oh, what a beautiful tree.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.136
We always wait untilthe kids are on break

40:30.177 --> 40:30.970
to decorate,

40:31.137 --> 40:33.764
so you guys got herejust in time.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.643
Really?

40:37.643 --> 40:38.644
I had nothing to do with that.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.396
[scoffs] Yeah, sure.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.856
I swear.

40:41.897 --> 40:42.857
[Amy]: Do you havesomething against Santa?

40:42.898 --> 40:43.983
[Grace]:Don't go there.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.443
Here you go.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.370
What's wrong?

40:56.412 --> 40:57.538
The roads aren'tgoing to be done

40:57.580 --> 40:58.664
until at least 4:00 a.m.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.666
Well, our guest roomis being renovated,

41:00.708 --> 41:02.960
but we do havea very comfy sectional.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.587
Thank you,

41:04.628 --> 41:05.671
but the parade is in 36 hours,

41:05.713 --> 41:06.964
and I have to get backfor final prep.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.009
Plus I still haveto find somebody to--

41:10.050 --> 41:11.677
Well, you know.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.471
Yeah. I know.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.181
Look, we can't goanywhere tonight,

41:15.222 --> 41:16.682
so let's sleep here,

41:16.682 --> 41:17.766
we'll leave at dawn,get your car,

41:17.892 --> 41:19.685
you'll be back in Green Riverby 9:00 a.m.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.146
Yeah, that could work.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.189
You sure you'll be okay

41:23.355 --> 41:25.816
with all the Christmasspirit here tonight?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.111
I'll make do.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.321
That's the spirit.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.742
[laughing]

41:34.783 --> 41:36.202
Mom, come on,please tell me what it is.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.244
Please!

41:41.540 --> 41:42.416
Can I see that?

41:42.541 --> 41:45.377
I'm really good atguessing presents.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.378
Trust me.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.298
Oh...

41:50.591 --> 41:51.675
Okay, yup.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.052
I know what it is.

41:53.093 --> 41:54.094
What?

41:54.136 --> 41:55.137
It's a turnip.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.055
It is not!

41:56.055 --> 41:56.972
You got a turnip!

41:57.014 --> 41:58.015
[laughter]

41:58.057 --> 41:58.766
No...

41:58.807 --> 41:59.767
[Ben]: Santa brought a turnip.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.060
It's not a turnip...

42:01.101 --> 42:02.228
[giggling]

42:02.269 --> 42:02.937
What's mine?

42:02.978 --> 42:04.313
Yours?Oh, that's easy.

42:05.147 --> 42:05.981
A toaster.

42:06.023 --> 42:09.068
What? No!I don't want a toaster!

42:09.109 --> 42:10.611
I'm sorry, you'regetting a toaster.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.405
This one is to mefrom Jeremy.

42:13.447 --> 42:14.406
Any guesses?

42:14.406 --> 42:15.449
From Jeremy...

42:16.575 --> 42:18.118
No, nothing.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.288
He just thought you mightlike a velour box.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.581
Wow.

42:22.581 --> 42:23.749
You're good.

42:23.749 --> 42:26.085
Okay, French Toast.

42:26.126 --> 42:27.211
[kids cheer] Yes!

42:33.050 --> 42:34.760
"...A wink of his eyeand a twist of his head,

42:34.802 --> 42:38.222
Soon gave me to knowI had nothing to dread--"

42:39.598 --> 42:40.933
That's not the end, Daddy.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.935
The last page is ripped out.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.688
It was an accident.

42:45.729 --> 42:46.689
Nice job, Tucker.

42:46.730 --> 42:49.567
Alyx, he's six.

42:49.608 --> 42:50.442
Give him a break.

42:50.484 --> 42:51.860
Do you rememberthe rest?

42:51.902 --> 42:54.572
Hang on, I'll go online.

43:01.954 --> 43:05.374
"He spoke not a word,but went straight to his work.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.543
"And filled all the stockings,

43:07.585 --> 43:10.045
"then turned with a jerk.

43:10.087 --> 43:12.464
"And laying his fingeraside of his nose,

43:12.464 --> 43:13.882
"and giving a nod,

43:13.924 --> 43:15.968
"up the chimney he rose.

43:15.968 --> 43:18.304
"He sprang to his sleigh,to his team gave a whistle,

43:18.345 --> 43:22.975
"and away they all flewlike the down of a thistle.

43:22.975 --> 43:26.895
"But I heard him exclaim,'ere he drove out of sight..."

43:26.937 --> 43:29.356
[all together]:"Merry Christmas to all,

43:29.398 --> 43:32.067
and to all a good night!"

43:34.862 --> 43:37.239
[♪♪]

43:51.378 --> 43:53.172
You awake?

43:54.340 --> 43:56.216
Yeah.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.471
Goodnight.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.432
Goodnight.

44:35.381 --> 44:36.548
Whatcha doing?

44:37.716 --> 44:39.176
Well...

44:39.218 --> 44:40.677
right now I'm havinga heart attack.

44:40.719 --> 44:42.554
Sorry.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.515
You working on the book?

44:44.556 --> 44:46.308
Yeah, I'm pre-writing.

44:46.350 --> 44:48.310
Oh, what's that mean?

44:48.352 --> 44:50.229
Means I'm trying tofigure out what to write.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.940
I've been pre-writingfor quite some time now.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.400
Hey, what are youdoing up so early?

44:54.400 --> 44:55.401
I had a bad dream.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.693
Let me guess,

44:56.735 --> 44:58.362
it was about not havinga Santa for the parade,

44:58.404 --> 44:59.405
and ruining Christmas?

44:59.405 --> 45:00.406
No.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.490
That would be a nightmare.

45:02.991 --> 45:05.119
Anyway, sinceI'm up so early,

45:05.160 --> 45:06.412
I'm going to seeif Amy has the ingredients

45:06.412 --> 45:07.371
to make eggnog.

45:07.413 --> 45:08.956
You know how to do that?

45:08.997 --> 45:10.582
Yeah, I do it allthe time at the store.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.919
"The World FamousLong Family Recipe."

45:13.919 --> 45:15.421
"World Famous," huh?

45:15.462 --> 45:16.672
Yeah.

45:16.713 --> 45:17.589
So if I do a little...

45:17.589 --> 45:18.715
[clucks tongue]Internet search,

45:18.757 --> 45:19.675
it'll come up?

45:19.717 --> 45:21.552
Mm-hmm.Why don't you try it?

45:22.761 --> 45:25.347
Okay.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.099
Let's see.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.184
"Long Family egg--"

45:30.728 --> 45:31.812
Oh.

45:31.854 --> 45:32.771
Yeah, it auto-completed"to eggnog", didn't it?

45:32.813 --> 45:33.939
Yes.

45:33.981 --> 45:35.149
Yes, it did.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.444
Impressive.

45:38.444 --> 45:39.528
Okay, but wait,

45:39.570 --> 45:41.488
who's the lumberjack?

45:41.530 --> 45:42.489
Oh.

45:42.531 --> 45:43.949
That's my ex. Mark.

45:43.991 --> 45:46.952
He moved to Oregonabout a year ago.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.454
No one since?

45:48.454 --> 45:49.496
No.

45:49.538 --> 45:50.748
I've just been focusing on work.

45:50.789 --> 45:51.999
What about you?

45:52.040 --> 45:55.669
Lots of potentialin Boston, I imagine.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.629
Aspiring novelists/slash/Uber drivers

45:57.671 --> 45:59.047
aren't exactly making the list

45:59.089 --> 46:01.592
of "Boston's Most EligibleBachelors."

46:01.633 --> 46:02.634
Yeah, but I mean,

46:02.968 --> 46:05.053
you at least broke awayfrom your family's expectations,

46:05.095 --> 46:06.805
and went and chasedyour dream.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.682
I'd imaginea lot of women love that.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.225
So you did have other dreams.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.977
Oh, we weren't talkingabout me.

46:12.019 --> 46:14.938
Okay, I think I haveall the ingredients I need.

46:14.980 --> 46:18.108
Milk, cream, eggs, and sugar.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.777
Okay, what spicesdo you need?

46:19.818 --> 46:22.112
I am not at liberty to say.

46:23.071 --> 46:25.991
Okay, so we start this

46:25.991 --> 46:29.453
by pouring inthe milk and cream.

46:29.495 --> 46:30.287
So, what other dreams

46:30.496 --> 46:31.455
did you havein your life, Grace?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.002
It doesn't matter.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.795
Oh, I thinkit does.

46:38.837 --> 46:39.838
I think it does.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.758
You've been judging meabout it non-stop.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.218
Come on,cone of silence.

46:44.259 --> 46:45.636
I know you lovethe store.

46:45.677 --> 46:46.678
I do love it.

46:46.929 --> 46:47.888
Well, what did you dreamabout doing with your life

46:48.180 --> 46:50.307
before you took it overfor your parents?

46:51.975 --> 46:54.520
I was goingto art school, okay?

46:54.561 --> 46:58.649
But then my parents diedright after high school,

46:58.690 --> 46:59.691
and, uh...

46:59.733 --> 47:01.360
then I wound upstaying home.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.403
And that's okay.

47:03.445 --> 47:05.364
I still get to paint,

47:05.364 --> 47:08.033
I just sell my workin the back of the store.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.285
It's okay.

47:12.579 --> 47:15.874
Okay, well...

47:15.916 --> 47:17.709
Next up...

47:17.751 --> 47:19.378
it's the eggsand the sugar.

47:19.378 --> 47:21.964
Shoo! Go away.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.465
Right.

47:23.507 --> 47:25.300
Like that...

47:25.342 --> 47:27.427
Pour a little bit of that in...

47:28.262 --> 47:29.847
One of these...[cracking egg]

47:31.014 --> 47:32.933
There we go.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.685
All right.

47:34.726 --> 47:35.811
Then you stir the pot,

47:35.853 --> 47:37.855
which you obviouslyenjoy doing.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.901
Now...

47:42.943 --> 47:44.611
time for the secret spices.

47:44.653 --> 47:45.404
Close your eyes.

47:45.404 --> 47:47.948
This is really unnecessary,

47:47.990 --> 47:49.157
you know that, right?

47:49.199 --> 47:50.284
I saw you peeking.

47:51.910 --> 47:53.579
Okay.

47:53.579 --> 47:54.788
Little of that.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.833
Little of this...

48:01.545 --> 48:02.212
All right,

48:02.254 --> 48:03.630
you want the first taste?

48:03.672 --> 48:06.592
Yeah, I'm not really muchof a "nog" connoisseur.

48:06.633 --> 48:07.634
Come on.

48:07.676 --> 48:09.553
It's famous, remember?

48:09.595 --> 48:12.306
Trust me,it's amazing.

48:13.515 --> 48:15.517
All right.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.020
Wow.

48:18.061 --> 48:19.938
See?

48:19.938 --> 48:21.732
I told you you could trust me.

48:22.608 --> 48:24.526
-More?-Sure.

48:24.568 --> 48:25.944
-Oh!-Really?

48:25.944 --> 48:27.613
Sorry. [laughs]

48:28.655 --> 48:30.490

48:31.992 --> 48:34.703

48:48.508 --> 48:49.801
[ringing bells]

48:49.843 --> 48:51.136
Well done.

48:51.178 --> 48:53.055
Sounding good, sounding good...

48:53.096 --> 48:54.473
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

48:54.514 --> 48:55.515
[cowbell clanking]

48:55.557 --> 48:56.975
Oh, no, no,okay, that's a bad bell.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.018
We'll swap that out,

48:58.060 --> 49:00.020
don't you worry.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.146
[bells tinkling]And ringing, and ringing, and--

49:01.146 --> 49:02.814
Okay, that's me

49:02.814 --> 49:04.024
Take a break, guys.

49:04.066 --> 49:05.901
Where are you?

49:05.943 --> 49:07.653
We'll be leavingin a few minutes.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.154
How's Worcester?

49:09.196 --> 49:10.656
I've been tryingto reach Grace.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.199
Is that her?

49:12.240 --> 49:13.825
Oh, no.No, no, no, no, no. Stall her.

49:13.825 --> 49:15.327
She's on an errand.

49:15.369 --> 49:16.578
She'll be back in a bit.

49:16.620 --> 49:17.663
Ah.

49:17.704 --> 49:19.831
But everything'sokay, right?

49:19.873 --> 49:22.167
It's Christmas in Green River.

49:22.209 --> 49:23.085
[chuckles]

49:23.126 --> 49:24.795
You didn't answer my question.

49:24.836 --> 49:26.713
I'll tell her to call you.

49:27.547 --> 49:28.840
Okay, bye.

49:29.841 --> 49:30.842
Is she gone?

49:30.842 --> 49:32.094
For now.

49:32.135 --> 49:33.011
When are you coming back?

49:33.011 --> 49:34.262
Soon.

49:34.304 --> 49:35.931
Why, is there actuallyanother problem?

49:35.972 --> 49:37.391
You know, besides the fact

49:37.432 --> 49:38.475
that we don't have a Santa,

49:38.684 --> 49:40.018
we might lose the "Good Day, USA" spot,

49:40.060 --> 49:41.353
and most likelypermanently damage

49:41.395 --> 49:43.063
the entire town's income stream?

49:43.105 --> 49:44.731
No, everything's fine.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.108
[gasps] Wait!No, it isn't!

49:46.149 --> 49:47.234
What?

49:47.275 --> 49:49.695
You didn't RSVP tomy ugly sweater party tonight.

49:49.695 --> 49:50.987
[sighs]

49:51.029 --> 49:52.322
Goodbye, Caroline.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.741
But you saidwe could go see Santa

49:54.783 --> 49:55.867
at the mall this morning.

49:55.867 --> 49:56.952
[tsks] Aw, buddy.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.829
You have a fever.

49:58.870 --> 50:00.539
We can't do it,I'm sorry.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.082
But you promised.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.125
How about we sit down

50:03.166 --> 50:05.335
and write Santaa letter instead?

50:05.377 --> 50:08.088
But Christmas Eveis tomorrow night.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.132
He'll never get it in time.

50:10.173 --> 50:11.133
Email, then.

50:11.174 --> 50:13.427
Last year, you saidSanta didn't do email!

50:13.468 --> 50:15.887
If we don't get to seeSanta in person,

50:15.887 --> 50:17.097
he won't knowwhat we want.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.056
He won't come.

50:18.056 --> 50:19.266
He won't come?

50:19.307 --> 50:20.892
Of course,he will, buddy.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.145
No, he won't!

50:23.186 --> 50:24.896
[crying]I want Santa!

50:24.896 --> 50:26.481
[mom]: Oh, sweetie.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.821
[doorbell rings]

50:35.615 --> 50:37.159
Ho-ho-ho!

50:37.200 --> 50:40.287
Merry Christmas,Sheridan family!

50:40.328 --> 50:42.372
[together]: Santa!

50:45.083 --> 50:46.293
It's Santa!You came!

50:46.334 --> 50:47.335
You actually came!

50:47.377 --> 50:49.004
Yes, I did...

50:49.045 --> 50:50.922
I have a surprise for you.

50:50.922 --> 50:52.716
-Thank you!-[whispers]: Thank you.

50:53.675 --> 50:54.426
Come on over.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.679
Tucker, come siton my lap.

50:57.721 --> 50:59.097
You really know my name?

50:59.139 --> 51:01.308
Of course, I know your name.

51:01.349 --> 51:03.894
I also know you've beena very good boy.

51:03.935 --> 51:06.772
So, what would you likefor Christmas?

51:06.772 --> 51:07.939
Wait, let me guess,

51:07.939 --> 51:09.858
something to do with robots?

51:09.900 --> 51:11.276
Yes, please.

51:11.318 --> 51:12.277
And Legos,

51:12.277 --> 51:13.236
and a puppy,

51:13.278 --> 51:15.113
and a new baby brother!

51:15.113 --> 51:16.406
Well...

51:16.448 --> 51:17.407
Legos and robots I can do,

51:17.491 --> 51:19.367
but a new brother...[chuckles awkwardly]

51:19.409 --> 51:20.869
I'll have to passthat message on

51:20.911 --> 51:21.953
to the right department.

51:21.953 --> 51:23.079
Thank you, Santa.

51:23.121 --> 51:24.915
You're welcome, Tucker.

51:27.083 --> 51:30.003
Alyx, I've seen how kindand generous you are.

51:30.045 --> 51:32.047
You're a wonderful big sister.

51:32.088 --> 51:33.215
She's the best.

51:33.256 --> 51:35.967
So, what would you likefor Christmas?

51:36.009 --> 51:37.969
Nothing with princesses on it.

51:38.011 --> 51:39.971
No princesses, got it.

51:39.971 --> 51:41.223
I like your style.

51:41.264 --> 51:42.974
So, what wouldyou like instead?

51:43.016 --> 51:44.059
Ooh...

51:44.101 --> 51:45.101

01:11:04.134 --> 01:11:05.803
I was worried.

01:11:05.844 --> 01:11:08.973
I thought somethinghappened to you.

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:10.099
Well,something kind of did.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.141
That's why I called...

01:11:11.141 --> 01:11:13.060
to dish about Ben,

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:13.978
and now that I know

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:15.187
you're not trappedunder a bookshelf,

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:16.188
we can do just that.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.649
Oh, this is so cute.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.734
You should display itat the store.

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:22.820
[Grace]: If I put outeverything I had,

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:24.363
it would beway too much Christmas.

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:25.990
There's nevertoo much Christmas.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.991
[grunts]

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:27.908
So...

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.077
tell me everything.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.161
Hmm.

01:11:31.161 --> 01:11:32.955
There's nothing muchto tell.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.457
He's probably alreadyback to Boston by now.

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:36.458
[Caroline]:But you said

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.127
he was goingto be Santa tomorrow,

01:11:38.168 --> 01:11:39.795
and I saw youslow-dancing,

01:11:39.837 --> 01:11:42.923
and I saw the wayyou look at each other.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.926
Yeah, well did you see the partwhere he stormed off?

01:11:46.677 --> 01:11:47.845
No.What happened?

01:11:47.886 --> 01:11:50.139
He said that I was justpretending to like him

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:51.223
to get him to be Santa.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.851
Of course, I told himthat wasn't true,

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.352
but then...

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:57.021
What?

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.649
Then he said I was in denialabout my own life...

01:12:02.026 --> 01:12:03.027
that I tell people

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.570
that I'm happywith the store

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:05.988
and the paradeand all that,

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.658
but that deep down,I'm really... really bitter

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:11.368
because I never gotto go to art school

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:13.245
because I took overthe shop

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.080
after my parents died.

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:17.541
He says I'm not doing

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:19.793
what I'm really meantto be doing.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.253
I mean, can you believe that?

01:12:21.295 --> 01:12:23.005
I mean,what a jerk, right?

01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:26.175
Caroline?

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:27.885
He might bea teensy bit right.

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:29.219
What?

01:12:29.219 --> 01:12:31.555
Grace, come on.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:35.434
You're amazingwith the store and the parade,

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:37.478
and everyoneis so grateful

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.729
for everythingyou've done,

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:39.563
but...

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:40.689
when we were younger,

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:42.608
you couldn't waitto get out of Green River

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:45.486
and paint the world.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.112
You have all thosebeautiful paintings

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:47.946
at the store

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.032
of Christmasall over the world,

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:52.493
but you've never been ableto see one of those places

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:53.577
in real life...

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:56.330
because you'restuck here,

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:57.372
living yourparents' dream...

01:12:58.415 --> 01:12:59.625
not yours.

01:12:59.666 --> 01:13:01.377
Hey!I stepped up.

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:03.921
Okay? Without me,the store would've closed,

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:05.089
and the parade,

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.131
and probably the whole town.

01:13:06.173 --> 01:13:07.466
I'm really proud

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.176
of everythingI've done for them.

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:10.094
See?

01:13:10.135 --> 01:13:12.304
For them.

01:13:12.346 --> 01:13:13.305
What about for you?

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.228
I'm sorry, Grace.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:23.816
I didn't meanto upset you.

01:13:27.444 --> 01:13:29.655
Caroline...

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:32.950
do you think it's possibleto love Christmas,

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:35.953
but just not wantto live and breathe it

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:38.080
every single day?

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.290
Not for me.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.795
Maybe for you.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:48.882
Maybe you shouldfind out.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.426
Yeah.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.519
[Grace]:Yeah, I think that...

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:01.895
I like that one.Yeah, I think so.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:02.896
Let's just switchthese two.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.273
I think that'llbe better.

01:14:04.314 --> 01:14:05.315
Great.It's going to be...

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.862
want to interview your Santaright before the parade.

01:14:09.903 --> 01:14:12.197
Oh, and good jobdelaying the parade

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.283
for the prime-time6:00 news!

01:14:14.324 --> 01:14:15.242
[laughs]

01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:16.493
There's going to be somany more people watching.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:18.078
So many more.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.330
It's going to be great.So, where is Ben?

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:21.915
Uh... Ben...

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:24.001
He's runninga little late.

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.085
Beard issues.

01:14:26.336 --> 01:14:28.130
But everything's okay,though, right?

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:29.423
Oh! Yeah, no.

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.340
Yeah, it's fine.

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:31.425
He just...

01:14:31.466 --> 01:14:33.010
he doesn't want to come outbefore the parade

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.179
'cause he's afraidit might ruin the mystique.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:36.054
The mystique?

01:14:36.096 --> 01:14:37.055
Yeah...

01:14:37.097 --> 01:14:38.223
and he asked

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:39.266
that there's not a lot

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:40.267
of cameras in his face,

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.518
so nothing too close.

01:14:41.518 --> 01:14:43.061
Pretty much just

01:14:43.103 --> 01:14:44.521
no close-ups at all.

01:14:44.521 --> 01:14:46.315
Wow.

01:14:46.356 --> 01:14:49.026
Who knew Santa was such a diva?

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:49.735
[laughing]

01:14:49.776 --> 01:14:50.819
I know, right?

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:52.029
Well, I'll letthe hosts know.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:53.030
Ta-ta!

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:53.822
Thank you!

01:14:53.864 --> 01:14:55.199
Excuse me!Pardon me.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.743
Why did you sayall that?

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.036
So that maybepeople won't see

01:14:59.119 --> 01:15:00.704
that our Santa doesn't havethe twinkle in his eye

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.206
that Tom did.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.207
And Ben.

01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:06.084
I saw your paintingof Ben.

01:15:06.126 --> 01:15:08.712
He really was incrediblewith those kids.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:09.713
Hey, uh...

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:11.715
can we getthe party started?

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:14.259
I really want to get homeand watch the game.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.762
[Tom]: Clint, what did I saywas the number one rule?

01:15:16.803 --> 01:15:20.015
Always stay in characterwhen you are in this suit.

01:15:20.057 --> 01:15:20.807
Always.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:21.767
What, Santa can'twatch football?

01:15:21.808 --> 01:15:23.560
[Tom]:F... football?

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.479
Did you hear that?

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.564
It's okay.It's okay. It's okay.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:28.690
[Tom]: Sorry, Grace.

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:30.234
I tried my best with him.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.652
I know you did.I know.

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.904
Grace,all this is my fault

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:36.657
I pushed Ben too hardto follow in my footsteps.

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.533
I should havelet him feel free

01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:40.911
to be who he wasmeant to be.

01:15:40.953 --> 01:15:42.829
I know he would have lovedto have heard that.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.168
I know I would have.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.964
Grace, honey,isn't this what you wanted?

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:56.510
Of course.

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.637
The entire townis counting on me.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:00.055
My family's counting on me.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.183
This store is the only linkthat I have left to my family.

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:06.645
But you don't have to liveChristmas every single day

01:16:06.687 --> 01:16:09.398

01:16:09.439 --> 01:16:10.607
They're always there,

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:13.735
and I know that if yourparents were here now,

01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:16.071
they'd want youto live your own life,

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:17.281
not theirs.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:22.911

Hello, children!

Take a seat.

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:45.549
Good to see you all.

01:20:51.721 --> 01:20:53.723
Thank you!Merry Christmas!

01:20:53.723 --> 01:20:56.101
Hey, how are you?

01:20:56.142 --> 01:20:58.061

for coming back.

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:04.067
You made this happen.

01:21:04.067 --> 01:21:07.737
Well, Santa's always happyto come to Green River.

01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:08.738
Can we talk?

01:21:08.738 --> 01:21:10.490
Merry Christmas.

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.453
I...I guess I'll just go.

01:21:15.495 --> 01:21:18.164
And what would you likefor Christmas?

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:22.085
That sounds wonderful.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:24.629
Now let me seewhat Santa can do.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.552
[Ben]:Grace!

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:32.971
Hey!

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.931
I've been lookingeverywhere for you.

01:21:36.099 --> 01:21:37.267
Why?

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.226
It's pretty obvious

01:21:38.351 --> 01:21:40.270
you didn't wantto talk to me over there.

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.272
Grace, all I wantedto do was talk to you.

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:43.857
It's just,I can't break character

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:44.899
when I'm in the suit.

01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:45.859
I thought you knew that.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:48.028
Oh.

01:21:48.069 --> 01:21:49.237
Right.

01:21:50.113 --> 01:21:51.072
So, Grace...

01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:52.574
Ben...

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:55.201
After you. After you.

01:21:56.620 --> 01:21:57.871
I just wanted to say

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:02.626
and you were right.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:03.460
About what?

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:05.921
About what I want to dowith my life.

01:22:07.297 --> 01:22:09.132
Painting makes me just as happy

01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:11.176
as anything I've ever doneat the store.

01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:12.969
So you're giving that up?

01:22:12.969 --> 01:22:14.054
No, no,

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:17.307
but I'm goingto find a balance.

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:18.975
I mean, just becauseI want to paint

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:20.393
doesn't mean I haveto give up my legacy,

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:23.438
so I'll have Carolinemanage the store more,

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.606
and when Christmasrolls around,

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:25.607
I'll appreciate it more,

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:28.193
and then,maybe next year,

01:22:28.234 --> 01:22:29.402
I'll be ableto see Christmas

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.488
somewhere otherthan Green River.

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:34.783
Maybe I'll start with Boston.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:38.995
You'll have to let meknow how it is.

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:40.288
Why?

01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:42.957
Because I'll be here.

01:22:42.999 --> 01:22:44.000
I'm staying.

01:22:45.168 --> 01:22:46.127
Why?I thought...

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:47.045
I know.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:49.339
Today, I saw the joyof Christmas again.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:53.176
I finally realized howimportant my dad's work is.

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:54.636
People need Santa.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.721
So you're goingto take over for your dad?

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:58.431
I mean,what about your writing?

01:22:58.473 --> 01:23:00.350
Watching youfollow your heart,

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.352
it's what made me lookinside mine,

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:03.478
and if you give that up...

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.521
I didn't say I wasgiving up my writing.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:07.148
I'm just going tofind a way to do both...

01:23:07.190 --> 01:23:08.149
like you.

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:09.275
In fact,

01:23:09.317 --> 01:23:11.861
I think I finallyfigured out

01:23:11.861 --> 01:23:12.946
what I was meantto write.

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.366
A children's book...

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:18.076
about a town's questto find Santa

01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:20.829
and bring him therefor a Christmas parade.

01:23:21.746 --> 01:23:23.873
Huh.Sounds familiar.

01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:25.875
Very believable.

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:26.751
[laughs]

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:27.752
Only one thing'smissing.

01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:28.712
What's that?

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:31.131
An illustrator.

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:32.507
You know anyonewho likes to paint?

01:23:34.634 --> 01:23:35.635
I believe I do.

01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:38.096
So, I guess

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.055
this is kindof a new beginning

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.141
for both of us.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.143
Yeah.

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.728
Maybe we should startfrom scratch.

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:46.688
What do you mean?

01:23:48.064 --> 01:23:49.524
[chimes]

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.029

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.003
Oh, no!

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:10.879
What?

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.130

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:41.117
There you go.Thank you!

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.119
If you could excuse usfor a couple minutes, please?

01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:44.370
Just a quick break.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:51.586
