39:14.586 --> 39:15.652

39:15.721 --> 39:17.087

39:21.793 --> 39:22.826

39:22.894 --> 39:24.194

39:24.262 --> 39:25.595

39:27.432 --> 39:28.431

Priscilla.

39:32.471 --> 39:33.737
- Thank you.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.039
I think obviously, the way
the game's been playing,

39:36.108 --> 39:37.374
it's been a pretty clear game,

39:37.442 --> 39:38.842

gonna be rookies

39:38.910 --> 39:41.177

that haven't been in.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.646
So that's either me
or Bettina.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.482
If I can avoid going in for
as long as possible,

39:45.550 --> 39:47.317
like every
other person would do...

39:47.386 --> 39:48.585
- Yeah.
- I would.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.654
But I came across, like,
some information.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.923
This is not a draw-out.
It's just simply a question,

39:53.992 --> 39:55.392
just to make
everybody's life easier,

39:55.460 --> 39:57.060
'cause it would involve
four people.

39:57.129 --> 40:00.196
But I heard that, allegedly,
Amber, that you had voiced

1:00:47.444 --> 1:00:52.347
[laughter]

1:00:52.416 --> 1:00:55.117
Wow.
It's getting very interesting.

1:00:55.185 --> 1:01:00.355
There are no more rookie-rookie
teams.

1:01:00.424 --> 1:01:03.458
What's gonna happen?

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:05.894
- Priscilla, you have

1:01:05.963 --> 1:01:10.365
completely
screwed everything up.

1:01:10.434 --> 1:01:14.736
The vets' war
has officially started.

1:01:14.805 --> 1:01:18.674
- I'll see you soon. Good luck.
- Let the games begin.

1:01:18.742 --> 1:01:20.242
- It feels so good.

1:01:20.310 --> 1:01:23.578
I had to take the responsible
and make a boss-ass move.

1:01:23.647 --> 1:01:26.148
<i> ♪ ♪</i>

1:01:28.218 --> 1:01:31.820
- I want to see a veteran
non-champion win this game.

1:01:31.889 --> 1:01:34.189
<i> So I see a clear option.</i>

1:01:34.258 --> 1:01:36.291
[all shouting]

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.392
- Get the [bleep] off me.

1:01:37.461 --> 1:01:38.460
- Go.
- Ahh!

1:01:38.529 --> 1:01:39.728
<i> - The vets all see that Cory</i>

1:01:39.797 --> 1:01:41.229
is trying to work
with Jeremiah.

1:01:41.298 --> 1:01:42.297
Shut the [bleep] up.
- You said who didn't look out

1:01:42.366 --> 1:01:43.298
for you?
- Shut up.

1:01:44.301 --> 1:01:45.367
- [indistinct] down there
- right now.y.

1:01:45.436 --> 1:01:46.334
I don't give a [bleep].
