19:01.662 --> 19:03.272
The Maple Leaf Oak.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.796
The most valuable,
endangered tree around.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.407
This school has everything.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.280
I still don't have enough, and
I bet JimJoe has more leaves.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.586
And the sun's setting.

19:12.629 --> 19:14.501
I got to hurry back.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.113
DEBBIE:
Okay. Come on.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.463
Nope. Nope, uh. Steady.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.379
There you are,
and look at all these leaves.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.424
You won.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.252
No, he did not.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.514
Yes, he did.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.342
Here's his trophy we brought.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.387
Yes... ah.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.998
What? This kid needs a doctor.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.304
[whispering]: Look at his head.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.176
No. He decides.

19:37.219 --> 19:39.482
Joshathon, are you okay?

19:39.526 --> 19:42.006
If heat rises...

19:42.050 --> 19:44.574
why is Canada cold?

19:44.618 --> 19:47.098
BOTH:
See, he's fine.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.100
Mm. Hmm.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.190
[slurping]

19:52.147 --> 19:54.323
Hey, what happened to Ollie?

19:54.367 --> 19:57.457
She got disqualified
and dehydrated.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.198
But it's cool.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.983
Because sometimes you just have
to let your kids fail, I guess.

20:02.026 --> 20:02.766
Right?

20:02.810 --> 20:04.507
You know, Freddie...

20:04.551 --> 20:06.117
[inhales sharply]

20:06.161 --> 20:08.598
...you don't practice
self-care for yourself.

20:08.642 --> 20:11.384
You over-extend so your family--

20:11.427 --> 20:13.212
yes, me included--

20:13.255 --> 20:14.561
can-can-can indulge.

20:14.604 --> 20:16.693
And I see that,
and I do thank you, hon,

20:16.737 --> 20:19.130
but you should go easier
on yourself.

20:19.174 --> 20:23.570
Yeah, I'll try to make Ollie do
more on her own.

20:23.613 --> 20:26.660
But you know I-I love how much
you push yourself.

20:26.703 --> 20:28.314
Right? I-I love that about you.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.185
But...

20:30.229 --> 20:32.796
I shouldn't expect the same
standards from everyone else,

20:32.840 --> 20:34.755
especially the kids.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.365
I know.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.454
-[moans]
-Ah...

20:38.498 --> 20:40.630
Aw. You're my teddy bear.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.763
And you're my stuffing.

20:46.723 --> 20:50.510
[imitating engine]

20:50.553 --> 20:52.033
Here we go, kids.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.208
Bring your leaf books up here,

20:53.252 --> 20:55.950
and Dr. Morocco,
and mostly myself,

20:55.993 --> 20:57.299
will tally you up.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.692
[panting]

21:01.216 --> 21:04.219
Well, it looks like
we have a clear winner here...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.177
-with JimJoe...
-Hold on, there!

21:06.221 --> 21:07.527
Tally this batch!

21:07.570 --> 21:09.180
No way, you are too late.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.008
-Aha!
-[crowd gasps]

21:11.052 --> 21:12.096
Son of a bitch.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.794
He's got the Maple Leaf Oak.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.926
And the rest of his book
is full.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.146
Well, this is just impressive.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.802
Todd Harper has won
this year's Leaf-A-Thon.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.934
[chuckles] Oh, God.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.719
And now, Dr. Morocco.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.416
[moaning, weak applause]

21:28.591 --> 21:31.507
It behooves me
to make mention that...

21:31.551 --> 21:33.509
Lyme disease is a big deal.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.424
[murmuring]

21:35.468 --> 21:37.339
In the battle
against fleas and ticks,

21:37.383 --> 21:40.299
one can always trust in Leave!
brand flea and tick deterrents.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.345
And we can thank Leave!
for sponsoring and conceiving

21:43.389 --> 21:45.304
of the Leaf-A-Thon, as always.

21:47.001 --> 21:49.873
Now, Todd Harper.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.572
Please come claim
your ice cream ticket,

21:52.615 --> 21:54.138
that expires in an hour,

21:54.182 --> 21:56.053
and say a few words.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.141
-[whooping]
-Yeah.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.882
[whoops] All right.

21:59.927 --> 22:02.059
[sighs]
You can all suck my bag.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.974
-[gasping]
-WOMAN: Oh.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.237
[laughing]

22:06.281 --> 22:07.630
I'm super cool,

22:07.674 --> 22:09.371
and it makes you
all mad and jealous.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.373
So suck on my bag,
and deal with your shit.

22:11.417 --> 22:12.374
Peace.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.333
[booing]

22:14.376 --> 22:16.335
Impressive dickishness.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.684
-[booing]
-Hmm.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.733
How'd you fill up
the book in time, Todd?

22:23.777 --> 22:26.562
I snuck Todd my leaves. Duh...

22:26.606 --> 22:27.998
What? When?

22:28.042 --> 22:30.131
When you and Mom were making out

22:30.174 --> 22:31.698
and making up,
like sappy suckers.

22:31.741 --> 22:34.788
See, me and Todd are
yin and yang.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.486
Together we always balance
each other's extremes.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.401
Kind of how your extreme styles
of parenting

22:39.445 --> 22:40.968
don't really work when separate.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.449
You guys do fine together.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.886
Got to get that balance, baby...

22:45.929 --> 22:48.323
[chuckling] So...

22:48.367 --> 22:50.456
let's all go get ice cream
at the Ice Cream Morgue

22:50.499 --> 22:52.240
before this ticket expires.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.807
ALL:
Yeah!

22:53.850 --> 22:56.418
I hope they got
steak ice cream.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.377
-[pop]
-[screaming]

22:58.420 --> 23:00.117
-FREDDIE: Oh, my God.
-OLLIE: Oh, no!

23:00.161 --> 23:02.468
I coddled my tick to death.

23:41.463 --> 23:41.855
Chirp.
