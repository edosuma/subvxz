00:54.031 --> 00:56.590
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I'm running
out of time.

00:56.591 --> 00:58.351
Absolutely. No problem.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.860
OK, so, last question.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.270
Jay. Go ahead.

01:07.271 --> 01:08.991
Ms Ashby, or Eve.

01:10.531 --> 01:13.091
First, may I say that it's kind of
amazing that you're here.

01:13.191 --> 01:16.631
One of the worlds leading prosecutors
in international criminal law.

01:17.671 --> 01:19.191
And I get to ask you a question.

01:21.351 --> 01:22.950
Which is?

01:22.951 --> 01:24.591
Yes, it's this.

01:25.260 --> 01:29.110
What motivates you to vomit up all
this neo-colonialist bullshit?

01:29.111 --> 01:31.780
- You don't have to answer that...
- No, it's all right.

01:32.351 --> 01:35.790
I'm motivated to see justice done,
wherever the crime took place.

01:35.791 --> 01:39.750
Oh, and it just so happens all these
crimes, they take place in Africa?

01:39.751 --> 01:44.150
We only prosecute those cases a
country is unable or unwilling

01:44.151 --> 01:46.990
- to prosecute for itself.
- Well, what about the West Bank?

01:46.991 --> 01:49.070
I believe that's an active situation.

01:49.071 --> 01:50.980
Situation?

01:51.991 --> 01:54.670
But when it comes to action,
there are at least 40 individuals

01:54.671 --> 01:58.190
being prosecuted by the International
Criminal Court right now,

01:58.191 --> 02:00.670
and each and every one of them
are Africans.

02:00.671 --> 02:01.847
Black Africans.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.150
And I'm sure they all
have a case to answer,

02:04.151 --> 02:06.640
properly represented in a court of law.

02:06.641 --> 02:09.686
But you're telling us you successfully
prosecuted one of those cases.

02:09.687 --> 02:10.675
Yes.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.390
And that doesn't make
you feel embarrassed?

02:12.391 --> 02:14.150
Embarrassed? Not at all.

02:14.151 --> 02:16.380
Really? Why not?

02:17.351 --> 02:20.470
After all, isn't what you do just
the latest example of self-righteous

02:20.471 --> 02:22.060
western paternalism?

02:22.991 --> 02:25.150
Of exactly the same sort that,
for hundreds of years,

02:25.151 --> 02:28.430
has systematically decimated that
continent of its wealth,

02:28.431 --> 02:31.780
its governments, its religions,
and most of all, its people?

02:32.671 --> 02:34.652
And now, having done it, you have
the temerity

02:34.653 --> 02:37.150
to expect them to turn to you
for justice?

02:37.151 --> 02:38.753
For justice that only you can provide,

02:38.778 --> 02:40.270
for crimes that surely would never

02:40.271 --> 02:43.700
have happened had your world not
gone there in the first place.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.030
So, you're right, I wouldn't feel
embarrassed

02:47.031 --> 02:49.190
Cos if I was you,
I'd feel fucking ashamed.

02:49.191 --> 02:51.990
Stop, that's it. I'm so sorry...

02:51.991 --> 02:54.070
African problems
deserve African solutions.

02:54.071 --> 02:55.790
- They don't deserve you.
- That's it.

02:55.791 --> 02:56.949
- Look...
- Enough!

02:56.974 --> 02:58.008
This is not the time.

02:58.009 --> 03:00.180
- Then when is the time?
- Not now.

03:02.151 --> 03:03.950
I'm sorry, I really have gone far over...

03:03.951 --> 03:06.460
Of course. Everyone.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.430
But...

03:16.431 --> 03:19.100
Just a minute, can I just say one thing?

03:19.791 --> 03:23.750
I stand by my record because it is
a record of justice, all right?

03:23.751 --> 03:25.630
Whatever the cause, whatever the history,

03:25.631 --> 03:28.190
we have delivered justice to the
people who needed it most,

03:28.191 --> 03:30.670
when otherwise they might not have
had it at all.

03:30.671 --> 03:34.780
And I'm proud to have done that,
and I'm proud to keep doing that.

03:36.031 --> 03:37.580
So, all right.

03:39.111 --> 03:42.190
And it may help you to know that my
daughter is black,

03:42.191 --> 03:44.510
and she was born in Africa.

03:44.511 --> 03:46.230
It doesn't.

03:46.231 --> 03:48.980
Not unless she's the one with the
solutions.

03:57.751 --> 04:02.431
REPEATED TAPPING

04:15.711 --> 04:18.511
INAUDIBLE

04:29.551 --> 04:30.631

05:49.991 --> 05:52.390
Are you sure you don't want to wait?

05:52.391 --> 05:54.590
This is about me, not her.

05:54.591 --> 05:57.470
And last time, she said she wanted
to be here.

05:57.471 --> 06:01.780
But here I am, and I've come
all on my own.

06:02.551 --> 06:04.740
Maybe that's how she wants it?

06:06.551 --> 06:08.100
And how do you feel about that?

06:10.711 --> 06:13.830
We've had this conversation a couple
of times now.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.990
And how do you feel about that?

06:15.991 --> 06:18.150
Ready to stop having it.

06:18.151 --> 06:19.551
Ever the lawyer, hmm?

06:20.991 --> 06:23.670
Actually, I'm a legal investigator.

06:23.671 --> 06:25.111
Slightly different.

06:26.191 --> 06:27.780
And how are things at work?

06:29.151 --> 06:31.620
Not too much pressure?

06:32.231 --> 06:34.620
Americano, flat white.

06:35.551 --> 06:38.780
Can't give a nut job
too much responsibility.

06:41.551 --> 06:46.020
Do you see yourself as a patient or
a protagonist?

06:46.671 --> 06:48.870
Aah, OK.

06:48.871 --> 06:52.790
Well, I see myself as a patient.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.830
We all are.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.710
Only the truly mad think they are
in control of their life.

06:58.711 --> 07:01.660
Is that Adam West enough for you,
Mr Riddler?

07:05.231 --> 07:06.271
OK.

07:07.951 --> 07:09.790
So, there you are.

07:09.791 --> 07:11.940
- Full supply.
- But?

07:12.671 --> 07:14.470
You read everything we suggested?

07:14.471 --> 07:16.590
Am I really going to tell you I didn't?

07:16.591 --> 07:18.511
But the stuff on survivor's guilt?

07:19.622 --> 07:24.990
Hmm, Primo Levi. Interesting choice.

07:24.991 --> 07:26.820
And, did it...

07:27.871 --> 07:29.351
...connect, with you?

07:31.231 --> 07:33.710
See, that's my problem, Doc.

07:33.711 --> 07:36.700
I don't know who it is I'm supposed
to connect with.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.460
I guess that's why I tried to kill
myself.

07:43.231 --> 07:44.271
And did you?

07:49.031 --> 07:50.471
Really?

07:56.311 --> 07:57.470
Oh, if I ever do try,

07:57.471 --> 07:59.950
I'll be sure to take a leaf out of
Mr Levi's book

07:59.951 --> 08:02.191
and jump straight out the window.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.790
I'm just kidding.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.980
I'm just kidding with you, it was a joke.

08:10.871 --> 08:11.911
Thanks.

08:13.991 --> 08:15.620
Do you know your birth name?

08:20.311 --> 08:23.380
- No.
- Want to find out?

08:27.391 --> 08:28.431
No.

08:30.231 --> 08:32.351
There's no-one left alive to tell me.

09:08.271 --> 09:09.790
Oh, for fuck's sake.

09:09.791 --> 09:12.260
- I'll find it myself.
- It's all right!

09:13.351 --> 09:14.620
I'm here.

09:16.111 --> 09:18.070
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

09:18.071 --> 09:21.241
- It's fine.
- I was at this lecture...

09:21.242 --> 09:23.270
Fucking horrible, and I couldn't get out.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.470
- It's all right.
- And then it was the traffic,

09:25.471 --> 09:28.390
and now my fucking phone's run out.

09:28.391 --> 09:31.310
I mean, why do they keep putting all
this shit in it

09:31.311 --> 09:33.910
if the battery can't cope?
Look, it's fine.

09:33.911 --> 09:35.270
Really.

09:35.271 --> 09:36.870
Everything is fine.

09:36.871 --> 09:38.795
- You sure?
- Yes.

09:38.796 --> 09:40.670
- It's OK?
- Yes.

09:40.671 --> 09:44.060
- You didn't need me?
- No.

09:45.111 --> 09:46.540
So, what did he say?

09:47.751 --> 09:53.151
Hmm. Patient, protagonist,
some kind of bullshit.

09:53.740 --> 09:55.110
But you don't have to come back?

09:55.111 --> 09:58.670
Nope, not unless I exceed the stated
dose...

09:58.671 --> 10:01.670
- Again.
- Not even in jest.

10:01.671 --> 10:04.660
You're talking to a major
depressive, this is how we cope.

10:07.431 --> 10:09.540
You're fantastic, you know that?

10:11.351 --> 10:13.500
- Mm-hmm.
- No, you really are.

10:14.511 --> 10:16.230
And what doesn't kill us...

10:16.231 --> 10:18.940
Waits for another chance.

10:22.391 --> 10:23.860
But not with you.

10:25.111 --> 10:26.540
Yes?

10:30.300 --> 10:31.591
Not with me.

10:35.791 --> 10:36.871
Come on.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.844
- I love you.
- I know.

10:48.511 --> 10:50.710
You want to go out for supper?

10:50.711 --> 10:53.750
Oh, well, unless one of my 57
boyfriends have called,

10:53.751 --> 10:56.510
I may find myself strangely available.

10:56.511 --> 10:58.630
There are reasons for that, my darling.

10:58.631 --> 11:02.183
Certainly are. Not least watching a
man's dick shrivel to the size of a

11:02.184 --> 11:04.710
cashew nut every time he looks at my
stomach.

11:04.711 --> 11:06.550
So, keep your top on!

11:06.551 --> 11:07.940
Practical advice.

11:08.671 --> 11:10.430
Always welcome.

11:10.431 --> 11:12.511
What else are mothers for?

11:43.191 --> 11:44.791
SHE WINCES

12:27.991 --> 12:32.510
Michael, you knew I wasn't going to
be in the office this afternoon.

12:32.511 --> 12:34.910
- Are you OK?
- Oh...

12:34.911 --> 12:38.460
Yeah. The price of a green conscience.

12:39.111 --> 12:41.230
I once shot at a polar bear.

12:41.231 --> 12:43.700
- Yeah?
- Yep. I missed.

12:45.511 --> 12:46.671
Are you OK now?

12:48.591 --> 12:50.310
Definitely.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.990
- I am, yeah.
- Ready to do some proper work?

12:53.991 --> 12:55.220
Sure.

12:55.791 --> 12:57.340
Come in and see me.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.980
- Thanks.
- Good.

13:04.671 --> 13:06.630
You came all this way just to say that?

13:06.631 --> 13:08.590
I'm looking for your mother.

13:08.591 --> 13:10.230
Oh, she'll be...

13:10.231 --> 13:13.670
- in the office.
- No, I went there.

13:13.671 --> 13:15.750
She's on her way, probably held up.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.790
Her phone's switched off.

13:17.791 --> 13:21.060
- Is there a problem?
- Might be a case coming in.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.991
- Big one.
- Oh, which one?

15:17.911 --> 15:19.911
Simon.

15:37.071 --> 15:39.751
This has been going on for quite a
while now.

15:41.711 --> 15:43.306
They keep stopping my
trucks from entering...

15:43.331 --> 15:45.137
- Yes, they do.
- Why?

15:45.138 --> 15:48.030
Because they keep turning up with
the wrong paperwork.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.350
What paperwork?

15:49.351 --> 15:51.870
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act,

15:51.871 --> 15:54.390
which requires us to guarantee that
all minerals in the...

15:54.391 --> 15:55.830
Fucking Americans?

15:55.831 --> 16:00.188
...all minerals imported from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo

16:00.213 --> 16:02.630
into our country are conflict-free.

16:02.631 --> 16:04.305
Your trucks have no such certification,

16:04.330 --> 16:06.215
and therefore, they cannot pass.

16:08.631 --> 16:10.030
I am fighting a war...

16:10.031 --> 16:11.710
- I know.
- ..for you.

16:11.711 --> 16:12.751
Simon.

16:15.511 --> 16:16.990
Because the Americans tell you...

16:16.991 --> 16:18.511
Because the war is over.

16:19.100 --> 16:23.100
And in peace time, you cannot keep
stealing from those mines.

16:32.071 --> 16:33.350
How else do I pay my men?

16:33.351 --> 16:34.990
You don't.

16:34.991 --> 16:36.950
You let them go.

16:36.951 --> 16:39.940
My officers would rather die than
leave my side.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.311
Your officers offered to shoot you
whilst you slept.

16:50.191 --> 16:52.910
You have not paid them for a long time.

16:52.911 --> 16:55.940
Because you keep stopping my fucking
trucks!

16:59.231 --> 17:00.271
Simon.

17:01.711 --> 17:02.751
Simon, look at me.

17:06.070 --> 17:08.980
Do you remember Kabale, before the war?

17:10.191 --> 17:12.109
All that?

17:12.111 --> 17:16.270
Anyway, we were in this taxi, you
and me, and I asked the driver...

17:16.271 --> 17:18.560
- No.
- What?

17:19.351 --> 17:21.670
David, with the long story...

17:21.671 --> 17:24.109
- It was just to make a point.
- So make it.

17:24.111 --> 17:27.300
The dog ends up dead in a ditch and
the cat gets away.

17:29.191 --> 17:32.580
- That is your point?
- For you not to be the dog, yes.

17:37.071 --> 17:39.180
There is a someone here to see you.

17:39.951 --> 17:42.260
He's from the US embassy.

17:45.111 --> 17:47.400
- No.
- He has something to offer.

17:48.591 --> 17:50.700
What can a mzungu offer me?

17:51.991 --> 17:53.740
A way to end this, now.

17:54.871 --> 17:55.911
A way home.

17:57.151 --> 17:59.670
I want to go home...

17:59.671 --> 18:01.150
...I just walk there.

18:01.151 --> 18:02.631
LOUD CLANG

18:05.431 --> 18:08.951
I think you're going to have to go
somewhere else first, my old friend.

18:20.991 --> 18:22.311
Where?

18:37.551 --> 18:40.180
General Nyamoya, welcome to the Hague.

18:52.151 --> 18:56.868
In other news, rebel army leader
General Simon Nyamoya

18:56.893 --> 18:58.932
is tonight behind bars in Holland,

18:58.933 --> 19:02.532
awaiting trial for war crimes at the
International Criminal Court.

19:02.533 --> 19:05.220
Tracy Schulman has this report.

19:05.685 --> 19:09.190
1994, and while the world looked
elsewhere,

19:09.191 --> 19:13.020
the small East African state of
Rwanda stared into the abyss.

19:13.991 --> 19:18.150
800,000 massacred in a 100-day
killing frenzy,

19:18.151 --> 19:21.230
while the international community
stood by.

19:21.231 --> 19:22.550
The perpetrators?

19:22.551 --> 19:24.467
Members of the Hutu majority

19:24.492 --> 19:27.750
led by a genocidal
government who, overnight,

19:27.751 --> 19:32.030
turned on their Tutsi neighbours
following years of ethnic tension.

19:32.031 --> 19:35.830
The saviours? A returning Tutsi
army, the RPF,

19:35.831 --> 19:39.070
which General Simon Nyamoya helped
to lead.

19:39.071 --> 19:41.390
The RPF brought the savagery to an end,

19:41.391 --> 19:45.180
and were applauded the world over
for their heroism.

19:45.871 --> 19:49.990
But, a quarter of a century on,
a different story.

19:49.991 --> 19:54.390
Today, Simon Nyamoya is no longer
the heroic victor of yesteryear,

19:54.391 --> 19:56.470
but instead wears the badgeless

19:56.471 --> 19:58.990
beret of a Congolese mercenary,

19:58.991 --> 20:00.388
fuelling endless conflicts

20:00.413 --> 20:03.780
on illicit riches stolen
from the region's mines.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.950
That Nyamoya is finally to face his
day in court

20:06.951 --> 20:09.541
may indeed be cause for celebration,

20:09.542 --> 20:13.190
although having already been
ostracised by his old allies,

20:13.191 --> 20:17.694
whether he remains an actual threat
to the region is harder to assess.

20:17.695 --> 20:19.554
Indeed, Bibi Mundanzi,

20:19.555 --> 20:22.820
Rwanda's long-term president, has
yet to comment.

20:23.277 --> 20:25.689
However, she has previously questioned

20:25.714 --> 20:29.794
why the West charges men like
Nyamoya when far worse criminals,

20:30.111 --> 20:32.950
some responsible for the genocide itself,

20:32.951 --> 20:35.420
remain at large, and untouched.

20:42.591 --> 20:47.030
Of course, there are many people
hiding in our neighbouring forests

20:47.031 --> 20:49.910
responsible for acts of genocide
against this country,

20:49.911 --> 20:52.830
but they cannot hide forever.

20:52.831 --> 20:54.390
And they will be caught.

20:54.391 --> 20:56.701
In the meantime, you're
happy to be sending

20:56.726 --> 20:58.590
Simon Nyamoya, your one-time ally,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.550
to the International Criminal Court?

21:00.551 --> 21:03.110
General Nyamoya gave himself up to
the Americans.

21:03.111 --> 21:05.270
We did not send him anywhere.

21:05.271 --> 21:07.510
But is the president happy to see
him tried there?

21:07.511 --> 21:12.070
She is happy to see justice occur
wherever it is delivered.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.350
But in the past, she's been highly
critical of the ICC.

21:15.351 --> 21:17.471
Officially she doesn't even recognise it.

21:18.951 --> 21:22.030
We have a great faith in the
international community.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.830
I may remind you that, in the last
year alone,

21:24.831 --> 21:28.390
we have enjoyed investments of 1.2
billion dollars,

21:28.391 --> 21:31.670
and not just in charity but business.

21:31.671 --> 21:36.750
In banking, mining, tourism,
construction, all regulated,

21:36.751 --> 21:38.271
certified and guaranteed.

21:39.431 --> 21:42.910
Our doors are open. The world is welcome.

21:42.911 --> 21:46.390
And is General Nyamoya the price for
that?

21:46.391 --> 21:48.190
What price?

21:48.191 --> 21:50.390
You keep saying this.

21:50.391 --> 21:52.251
General Nyamoya gave himself up

21:52.276 --> 21:54.830
to the scrutiny of international justice.

21:54.831 --> 21:56.150
And because of this,

21:56.151 --> 22:00.100
I am certain he will receive exactly
the trial he deserves.

22:04.111 --> 22:05.710
No.

22:05.711 --> 22:08.910
She goes on a list, that's the best
I can offer.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.760
The last time Eve Ashby
prosecuted a case here,

22:11.785 --> 22:14.430
she won in record time.

22:14.431 --> 22:16.110
You could do with another one of those.

22:16.111 --> 22:19.430
And she will be carefully considered
along with the others.

22:19.431 --> 22:22.711
Come on, Capi, what do I have to
do to make this work, hmm?

22:25.351 --> 22:26.940
Join a queue.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.750
- Madam Secretary?
- Assistant Secretary, Peter.

23:12.751 --> 23:14.990
More talk like that will get me fired.

23:14.991 --> 23:16.590
I thought we'd lost you for the day.

23:16.591 --> 23:17.990
But now I'm back.

23:17.991 --> 23:19.351
That's politics, baby!

23:21.111 --> 23:23.031
God, I'm starving.

23:25.191 --> 23:27.390
So, what can I have?

23:27.391 --> 23:30.710
You told me to resist these questions
as if you were the devil himself.

23:30.711 --> 23:32.630
So, what CAN I have?

23:32.631 --> 23:34.711
A small handful of unsalted almonds.

23:39.231 --> 23:43.750
OK. And a copy of the indictment in
the General Nyamoya case.

23:43.751 --> 23:44.960
A perfect complement.

23:44.985 --> 23:47.575
And set up a call with
Capi Petridis, ASAP.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.270
And with whose authority are
you making this request?

23:52.271 --> 23:55.430
Capi, I'm head of the Bureau of
African Affairs,

23:55.431 --> 23:58.470
I think it's fair to say that my
authority is all you need to hear.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.190
OK, I've heard it.

24:00.191 --> 24:01.848
And what are you going to do about it?

24:01.849 --> 24:06.430
Eunice, her name is on the list
along with the others.

24:06.431 --> 24:08.119
And what I'm suggesting to you is

24:08.120 --> 24:12.150
there should only be one name on
that list. Eve Ashby.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.470
Your suggestion is noted.

24:14.471 --> 24:18.910
Noted? Capi, I'm not sure you're quite
getting what I'm offering here.

24:18.911 --> 24:21.390
My government has yet to ratify the
Rome Statute,

24:21.391 --> 24:23.870
and therefore we still do not
recognise your court.

24:23.871 --> 24:26.630
But here is a perfect opportunity for us

24:26.631 --> 24:28.870
to take a big step towards that.

24:28.871 --> 24:30.950
I strongly advise you to grab it.

24:30.951 --> 24:33.310
Just because she's an old friend of
yours?

24:33.311 --> 24:36.190
Because she's the best prosecutor
there is.

24:36.191 --> 24:37.380
And you'll need her.

24:50.471 --> 24:52.200
You knew she was going to do that.

25:03.311 --> 25:04.351
We're on.

25:06.311 --> 25:07.870
You can't do it.

25:07.871 --> 25:09.630
- I've said yes.
- Say no!

25:09.631 --> 25:10.950
I understand your feelings...

25:10.951 --> 25:12.990
Which one? I have so many!

25:12.991 --> 25:14.590
I know it must feel very close...

25:14.591 --> 25:19.190
Close? General Nyamoya is a Rwandan
Tutsi, Mama.

25:19.191 --> 25:20.950
Who is accused of 13 counts of war...

25:20.951 --> 25:22.230
Who helped stop the genocide!

25:22.231 --> 25:23.575
And then he went into the Congo

25:23.600 --> 25:25.257
- and he did a lot of bad things...
- I'm a Rwandan Tutsi, Mama.

25:25.282 --> 25:26.670
No!

25:26.671 --> 25:29.590
You have a British passport and
you're my daughter.

25:29.591 --> 25:31.230
Yes, only because I survived.

25:31.231 --> 25:33.830
And without them, how would that
have happened?

25:33.831 --> 25:35.390
It's not so simple, darling.

25:35.391 --> 25:37.550
It is to me. I mean, to me, what
you're doing,

25:37.551 --> 25:39.550
it's like the Second World War is over,

25:39.551 --> 25:40.950
and we're Jewish, and suddenly,

25:40.951 --> 25:43.017
you've decided to prosecute
General Eisenhower

25:43.042 --> 25:44.510
because he tried to stop Hitler!

25:44.511 --> 25:46.470
Well, if Eisenhower had
committed war crimes,

25:46.471 --> 25:48.630
- he would have been prosecuted.
- Yes, but not by you!

25:48.631 --> 25:52.790
Not you, my mother, because for me,
it's like the SS is still out there,

25:52.791 --> 25:54.834
and all you're trying to do is prosecute

25:54.835 --> 25:57.151
one of the few men who tried to
stop them!

26:28.871 --> 26:32.780
Are you... Are you trying to drive a
wedge between us, Mama?

26:34.791 --> 26:36.511
Make me stand on my own two feet?

26:38.477 --> 26:39.877
Do you think you can't?

26:46.311 --> 26:48.390
Did you think I should?

26:48.391 --> 26:50.620
I think you're ready, yes.

26:51.191 --> 26:53.640
I think if you have me hovering
over you for the rest of your life,

26:53.665 --> 26:55.895
you'll never, ever fly.

26:57.471 --> 26:58.511
So...

26:59.511 --> 27:03.420
So all this is... Is what,
a way to cut me loose?

27:03.911 --> 27:05.020
No!

27:06.431 --> 27:09.270
You can't choose when something
happens, Kate.

27:09.271 --> 27:11.590
If it was 18 months ago, of course
I wouldn't have done it.

27:11.591 --> 27:15.340
But it's not, it's now, and now you
are better.

27:16.351 --> 27:18.190
And now I have to take this case.

27:18.191 --> 27:20.550
- But why?
- Because it's the right thing to do.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.591
Who...

27:22.671 --> 27:23.951
Who for?

27:25.271 --> 27:26.831
You?

27:26.856 --> 27:29.216
- Everyone.
- Not me.

27:29.241 --> 27:30.281
Everyone.

27:32.271 --> 27:33.311
Trust me.

27:35.791 --> 27:40.140
There are still men in the Congo

27:40.751 --> 27:43.300
responsible for the genocide, Mum.

27:44.151 --> 27:45.751
You want to do the right thing...

27:47.111 --> 27:48.511
...you should prosecute them.

28:32.610 --> 28:33.650
Ah, it's fine.

28:35.071 --> 28:36.590
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.470
It's just a mole. Not cancer.

28:39.471 --> 28:40.990
OK.

28:40.991 --> 28:43.030
It's quite large, though.

28:43.031 --> 28:45.550
I can remove it for you, peace of mind?

28:45.551 --> 28:48.030
No, no. It's fine.

28:48.031 --> 28:49.950
It's very simple. A few minutes, no
problem.

28:49.951 --> 28:51.631
No, no, no, no, no.

28:54.711 --> 28:56.551
I'll wait until I go home.

29:01.071 --> 29:02.950
You don't trust me?

29:02.951 --> 29:04.351
No, no, no, no. It's just...

29:05.431 --> 29:07.030
Well, you know.

29:07.031 --> 29:10.150
- Know what?
- It's fine, Doctor.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.030
Really. Thanks for looking.

29:12.031 --> 29:13.111
It's much appreciated.

29:30.831 --> 29:32.550
Do you want francs or dollars?

29:32.551 --> 29:35.019
You suspect I will flee the country?

29:35.020 --> 29:36.391
Francs.

29:41.271 --> 29:42.311
...the fuck?

29:44.431 --> 29:45.910
Who was that?

29:45.911 --> 29:47.831
- Who?
- That guy, just went through.

29:49.031 --> 29:50.071
I don't know.

29:52.871 --> 29:53.911
I do.

30:09.991 --> 30:11.780
You work for the hospital?

30:12.711 --> 30:13.991
Or do you work for him?

30:16.431 --> 30:19.551
Oh, it's OK. I already know.

30:29.671 --> 30:31.271
Major. Major!

30:32.311 --> 30:33.551
You've not paid.

30:34.831 --> 30:36.551
Do you know who that guy is?

30:37.380 --> 30:38.790
That guy is a war criminal with

30:38.791 --> 30:41.671
an international warrant on his head.

30:42.871 --> 30:44.110
No!

30:44.111 --> 30:45.910
Oh, yes.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.430
His name is Patrice Ganimana.

30:47.431 --> 30:50.990
He's like a Hutu general, took part
in the Rwanda genocide.

30:50.991 --> 30:54.670
He is responsible for the death of
about a million people.

30:54.671 --> 30:58.910
- No.
- Right here in your hospital.

30:58.911 --> 31:01.030
Sitting in a wheelchair.

31:01.031 --> 31:03.630
Pretty nurses and everything.

31:03.631 --> 31:04.671
Who?

31:07.863 --> 31:10.900
Patrice Ganimana.

31:13.886 --> 31:17.950
Yeah. He may not be the ace of spades,

31:17.951 --> 31:20.231
but he is certainly the 10 of clubs.

31:23.391 --> 31:24.620
Sometimes...

31:27.071 --> 31:29.671
...Europeans have difficulty telling
our faces apart.

31:30.791 --> 31:33.510
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- You're mistaken.

31:33.511 --> 31:34.950
The fuck I am.

31:34.951 --> 31:36.430
Please, sir, you're in hospital.

31:36.431 --> 31:40.030
Yeah, and he should be in the Hague.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.220
Please.

31:41.897 --> 31:43.497
Just pay your bill.

31:52.791 --> 31:54.471
Aah...

31:57.324 --> 31:58.684
Keep the change.

32:09.317 --> 32:10.877
Oh, yeah.

32:15.631 --> 32:17.311
I know them.

32:18.351 --> 32:19.990
You haven't answered the question.

32:19.991 --> 32:22.310
And you haven't picked up that file.

32:22.311 --> 32:23.630
It's an immigration appeal.

32:23.631 --> 32:25.150
I'd like your opinion on it.

32:25.151 --> 32:28.151
Why did you give her the Nyamoya case?

32:29.511 --> 32:32.150
I'm not saying there is any pressure
on your room rental, Kate,

32:32.151 --> 32:34.710
but obviously I wouldn't be saying
it if there wasn't.

32:34.711 --> 32:37.670
They are prosecuting the wrong man
on the wrong side,

32:37.671 --> 32:39.590
and you've chosen the wrong person
to do it.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.060
Because he's a Tutsi?

32:42.129 --> 32:43.181
And so am I.

32:43.206 --> 32:45.910
And you'll be delighted when
the judge agrees with you.

32:45.911 --> 32:47.990
It isn't your world.

32:47.991 --> 32:49.591
- The Congo?
- The genocide.

32:51.671 --> 32:55.550
I prosecuted one of the first cases
for the ICTR in '98.

32:55.551 --> 32:57.390
Your mother was my junior.

32:57.391 --> 33:01.270
It's where we met. I'd go so far as
to say it's why you're here.

33:01.271 --> 33:05.034
And I don't want to go back to any
of it, ever.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.830
Do you think your mother loves you, Kate?

33:08.831 --> 33:10.870
You think she'd ever do anything to
harm you?

33:10.871 --> 33:14.710
- It's a silly question.
- It is, so why do you keep asking it?

33:14.711 --> 33:16.567
Your mother is one of the most steadfast

33:16.592 --> 33:18.190
and loyal people I have ever met,

33:18.191 --> 33:21.350
and most of that has been directed
at you.

33:21.351 --> 33:23.150
She's also one of the smartest.

33:23.151 --> 33:26.024
So if she's chosen to prosecute
Simon Nyamoya,

33:26.025 --> 33:29.031
I'd trust her to do it.
Let her do her job, Kate.

33:30.031 --> 33:31.460
And you...

33:32.031 --> 33:34.351
...do yours. I'd like that back in
the morning.

33:47.311 --> 33:48.791
- Oh, Miss Ashby.
- Hi, Frank.

33:50.431 --> 33:51.471
Sweetheart?

33:53.351 --> 33:56.340
Sweetheart, would you close the door?

33:57.551 --> 33:59.711
- Yes.
- Thank you.

34:10.231 --> 34:11.791
Mine's a flat white.

34:17.710 --> 34:19.710
Are you taking on a new case?

34:19.710 --> 34:21.110
Just an opinion.

34:22.511 --> 34:23.551
Well, that's a start.

34:25.751 --> 34:27.500
I didn't think this was allowed.

34:28.670 --> 34:30.030
Um-hmm?

34:30.031 --> 34:33.230
Thought we weren't allowed to be in
the same room together.

34:33.231 --> 34:36.781
- Um-hmm. Of course we are.
- Alone.

34:42.929 --> 34:44.260
I'm leaving, Kate.

34:47.958 --> 34:48.981
What?

34:49.005 --> 34:51.614
Your mother's asked me to be her
permanent rep at the Nyamoya case.

34:55.110 --> 34:56.391
You're going to the Hague?

34:58.471 --> 35:00.180
- Yep.
- Wow.

35:01.191 --> 35:02.910
I mean, she only got it yesterday.

35:02.911 --> 35:03.951
Yeah, but...

35:04.991 --> 35:06.140
We saw it coming.

35:07.231 --> 35:09.671
- How?
- All I know is

35:10.780 --> 35:14.950
everyone was pushing Nyamoya to
hand himself in.

35:14.951 --> 35:17.310
The DRC, Rwanda,

35:17.311 --> 35:19.230
us, the Americans.

35:19.231 --> 35:21.271
- Everyone.
- Why?

35:22.871 --> 35:23.898
He was a warlord.

35:23.923 --> 35:25.790
There are others still
out there, far worse.

35:25.791 --> 35:26.990
Oh.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.700
Same thing's happening to them.

35:29.671 --> 35:33.340
- I haven't seen it.
- Yes, we have.

35:35.831 --> 35:37.550
There's a genocide...

35:37.551 --> 35:38.591
Genocide.

35:40.191 --> 35:42.980
Look, the region just wants to move
on, Kate.

35:45.511 --> 35:46.551
A fresh start.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.471
So should you.

36:16.984 --> 36:18.984
FIB have been informed.

36:19.191 --> 36:21.510
And when do you think they'll show up?

36:21.511 --> 36:24.780
Well, next week, next month, next year?

36:25.671 --> 36:28.190
And, how long does it take to get an
X-ray?

36:28.191 --> 36:29.950
Because I think that's what he was
having.

36:29.951 --> 36:32.110
What are you trying to do here, Major?

36:32.111 --> 36:35.270
Not to repeat past mistakes, sir.

36:35.271 --> 36:39.830
- Like?
- Well, I come from Quebec,

36:39.831 --> 36:43.301
and the last time a Canadian was in
charge of this sort of thing was

36:43.302 --> 36:46.380
over in Rwanda during the genocide.

36:47.711 --> 36:49.151
It didn't end so well.

36:50.151 --> 36:52.711
I'm hoping the same thing won't
happen to me.

36:53.751 --> 36:59.471
Or, and with the greatest respect,
sir, to you.

37:00.511 --> 37:02.030
Me?

37:02.031 --> 37:03.420
You're French.

37:04.151 --> 37:06.430
Some people think it was you guys
back then

37:06.431 --> 37:08.031
that helped people like this

37:08.917 --> 37:11.631
Ganimana here to escape in the first
place.

37:13.911 --> 37:15.150
Not me, Major.

37:15.151 --> 37:17.511
In '94 I was reading Lucky Luke.

37:19.151 --> 37:24.910
Well, then you better hope that some
of that has rubbed off.

37:24.911 --> 37:27.860
You carry on like this, you're going
to need it.

37:30.644 --> 37:32.604
SHOUTED COMMAND

37:32.910 --> 37:34.230
IN FRENCH: Continuez.

37:39.831 --> 37:40.871
Man.

37:50.751 --> 37:52.230
Oh, Evie.

37:52.231 --> 37:53.911
Save it for the judge.

37:59.671 --> 38:04.151
You may want to choose a corner, there.

38:10.151 --> 38:13.551
There's not a day passed I hadn't
thought of telling her.

38:15.591 --> 38:16.631
And when she...

38:18.071 --> 38:21.790
...when she tried to do what she did,
I knew why I hadn't.

38:21.791 --> 38:23.471
It's what we all agreed.

38:25.071 --> 38:26.190
But what if I was wrong?

38:26.191 --> 38:28.070
What if it's the other way round?

38:28.071 --> 38:31.710
What if she only did what she did
precisely because I hadn't told her?

38:31.711 --> 38:33.270
You can't think like that.

38:33.271 --> 38:35.590
No, because it damns me both ways.

38:35.591 --> 38:37.790
You rescued a child.

38:37.791 --> 38:38.991
And you gave her a life.

38:40.431 --> 38:41.871
But not her past.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.471
And you're about to do that, too.

38:46.111 --> 38:47.950
Well, what if I was right in the
first place?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.671
And what if she's still not ready?

38:56.511 --> 38:58.150
That it?

38:58.151 --> 38:59.471
Yes.

39:03.911 --> 39:06.260
Maybe you should have let me
take the case.

39:07.085 --> 39:08.390
She's my daughter!

39:08.391 --> 39:10.910
But it's not just about her now, is it?

39:10.911 --> 39:14.030
It's about that, and this.

39:14.031 --> 39:16.470
And seeing this done at last.

39:16.471 --> 39:18.230
I know what it's about, Michael.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.990
Well, then you've answered during
question, haven't you?

39:20.991 --> 39:23.630
This is our chance. It might not
come again.

39:23.631 --> 39:25.311
We got to take it while we can.

39:27.537 --> 39:29.657
You're right, of course you are.

39:29.682 --> 39:31.442
Been a long time coming.

39:34.124 --> 39:35.404
Over 20 years.

39:36.911 --> 39:40.580
And sometimes I feel whatever it is
we've been holding out for,

39:41.237 --> 39:43.437
or clinging onto, I don't know...

39:46.631 --> 39:48.940
It's dragged me out so far...

39:51.311 --> 39:53.151
...I'm not sure I can never get back.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.980
But, I mean, you will.

39:58.591 --> 40:01.260
You'll be fine, and so will Kate.

40:19.671 --> 40:21.220
I wish we'd fallen in love.

40:22.231 --> 40:23.271
Well, we didn't.

40:24.991 --> 40:26.711
Why we're still friends.

40:35.591 --> 40:38.110
She has connections with Rwanda?

40:38.111 --> 40:40.830
Oh, yes. She adopted a Rwandan child,

40:40.831 --> 40:45.550
and she helped prosecute one of the
first cases after the genocide.

40:45.551 --> 40:48.870
Against the men who carried out
the genocide?

40:48.871 --> 40:52.231
Yep. Which I helped bring to an end.

40:53.391 --> 40:56.350
So, she and I...

40:56.351 --> 40:57.900
...we are on the same side.

41:00.471 --> 41:02.871
- We better hope so.
- There is no hope about it.

41:04.631 --> 41:08.500
We are on the same side.

41:13.311 --> 41:14.870
It's not about sides.

41:14.871 --> 41:16.060
Isn't it?

41:16.551 --> 41:19.670
Back then, you and Nyamoya were
chasing the same thing.

41:19.671 --> 41:23.110
Evil Hutus. You as a lawyer, him as
a soldier.

41:23.111 --> 41:27.150
And because of that, you're asking
me to do what, exactly?

41:27.151 --> 41:29.430
To remove him from the field, no doubt.

41:29.431 --> 41:31.190
But also, perhaps,

41:31.191 --> 41:34.790
to allow him to return to an
entirely peaceful retirement

41:34.791 --> 41:38.380
in the not too distant future.
He was a hero, after all.

41:39.751 --> 41:40.791
A hero?

41:42.871 --> 41:45.900
Just because you asked me to forget,
doesn't mean I did.

41:48.471 --> 41:51.590
The indictment accuses him of the
enlistment of child soldiers for the

41:51.591 --> 41:54.950
purposes of war in the DRC from 2004...

41:54.951 --> 41:57.471
- It's not the date I'm interested in.
- ..to 2006.

41:59.151 --> 42:01.111
- Then, which?
- I just told you.

42:02.271 --> 42:04.220
The one you asked me to forget.

42:04.990 --> 42:06.110
Back then.

42:27.511 --> 42:28.950
I thought I was visiting a friend?

42:28.951 --> 42:30.430
Friends don't ask people to lie.

42:30.431 --> 42:32.150
And friends don't try to undermine you.

42:32.151 --> 42:34.070
By telling them the truth?

42:34.071 --> 42:36.590
David, isn't that exactly what
friends are for?

42:36.591 --> 42:39.990
Oh, Eve, we are used to seeing
zealots in dog collars,

42:39.991 --> 42:42.270
but not in horsehair wigs.

42:42.271 --> 42:43.831
Neither will save my country.

42:46.631 --> 42:48.740
It's a little more complex than that.

42:50.511 --> 42:51.551
Isn't it?

42:53.991 --> 42:56.390
We have a duty to memory.

42:56.391 --> 42:57.431
Whose?

42:58.551 --> 42:59.780
Hers?

43:00.551 --> 43:02.066
Yours?

43:02.067 --> 43:03.431
Everyone's.

43:07.071 --> 43:08.630
Some things are best left forgotten.

43:08.631 --> 43:09.671
Not this.

43:11.751 --> 43:15.140
Tell them now, David, now that the
going's good.

43:28.591 --> 43:29.991
Thank you for the drink.

43:51.431 --> 43:54.940
And for what you did for us,
all of those years ago.

44:15.577 --> 44:16.777
Aah.

44:16.991 --> 44:21.070
- Transfer. I want to stay...
- Hey, Harper.

44:21.071 --> 44:24.310
- Mikey.
- How's my girl today?

44:24.311 --> 44:26.190
Oh, grand.

44:26.191 --> 44:28.910
- Just grand.
- What you reading her?

44:28.911 --> 44:30.270
Just an old Graham Greene.

44:30.271 --> 44:31.511
Oh, she'll love that.

44:34.631 --> 44:35.671
So...

44:37.111 --> 44:38.260
I'm on my way.

44:39.911 --> 44:42.671
Great, thanks, Harvey.

44:45.871 --> 44:47.550
Next time.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.190
Great.

44:49.191 --> 44:51.460
- Give my love to Jenny.
- Bye, Hannah.

44:58.671 --> 45:01.180
He's better for your mother,
wouldn't you say?

45:02.380 --> 45:03.831
Much, much better.

45:05.951 --> 45:07.220
Oh.

45:07.911 --> 45:09.700
You've got some colour in your cheeks.

45:11.431 --> 45:12.471
That's nice.

45:17.057 --> 45:18.297
Oh.

45:19.431 --> 45:22.140
The Nyamoya case is about to begin.

45:23.717 --> 45:26.820
I don't think it will give us all
the answers, but it's a start.

45:29.631 --> 45:30.990
It's a start, darling.

45:30.991 --> 45:35.111
And Daddy'll find the end, I promise.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.991
So, where we at?

45:55.551 --> 45:57.710
Frank? My mother just called.

45:57.711 --> 46:00.711
She needs me to pick something up
from her office on my way home.

46:46.951 --> 46:48.791
Is she still in there?

46:55.551 --> 46:59.031
Give that to me. Give it to me now!

47:05.631 --> 47:08.070
- How much did you see?
- I...

47:08.071 --> 47:09.630
It's illegal, what you're doing.

47:09.631 --> 47:10.671
It's illegal.

47:12.311 --> 47:14.430
Is... Is this a taxi rank job?

47:14.431 --> 47:15.710
You didn't have a choice?

47:15.711 --> 47:17.590
Of course I did.

47:17.591 --> 47:19.910
And I... I just...

47:19.911 --> 47:22.100
I don't understand. Why?

47:28.591 --> 47:30.431
Take a long, hard look.

47:32.071 --> 47:33.351
Look at it.

47:37.503 --> 47:38.940
And you remember it.

47:40.071 --> 47:43.171
Remember it. And then one day,

47:43.172 --> 47:46.231
hopefully, one day soon
you'll understand.

47:47.511 --> 47:49.100
Take a look at this.

47:49.671 --> 47:51.671
Take a good, hard look.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.871
This is what they did to me.

47:56.831 --> 47:58.471
I don't remember my family.

47:59.471 --> 48:01.020
Or my country.

48:01.631 --> 48:02.671
Nothing.

48:03.871 --> 48:06.710
I don't know my own name!

48:06.711 --> 48:11.082
The only thing I know is that it
happened to nearly a million people,

48:11.083 --> 48:13.935
and I will never forget it, and
neither should anyone else.

48:13.936 --> 48:14.955
And no-one will.

48:14.980 --> 48:17.575
Except you're going to
give them the excuse!

48:19.311 --> 48:21.631
I don't know what's in there.

48:23.351 --> 48:24.671
But it won't match this.

48:26.111 --> 48:30.670
But you push that, and everyone can
go back to what they really think.

48:30.671 --> 48:34.230
That down there, genocide, war crimes,

48:34.231 --> 48:36.231
that's just what they all do
to each other!

48:37.671 --> 48:40.231
That we're all just cats in a bag!

48:42.271 --> 48:44.551
That we're all just monkeys!

48:46.231 --> 48:48.110
I don't give a shit what they think
up here.

48:48.111 --> 48:50.070
I'm only talking to the people that
matter,

48:50.071 --> 48:52.750
and if they don't want to see their
country turn into another...

48:52.751 --> 48:55.150
- The arrogance!
- ..Into another fucking Yugoslavia,

48:55.151 --> 48:57.089
they'll need to listen.

48:57.090 --> 48:58.311
And so will you.

49:01.071 --> 49:03.631
And you're the only one to tell us.

49:04.911 --> 49:05.951
Yes, I am.

49:08.071 --> 49:09.351
I really, really am.

49:11.751 --> 49:14.260
Spoken like a true Mzungu.

49:23.551 --> 49:25.631
Don't. I'm leaving tomorrow.

49:30.271 --> 49:34.791
And I will never understand why.

49:35.991 --> 49:38.631
Don't expect me at... home.

I know who owns these vehicles.

52:49.951 --> 52:53.270
Your boss is one of the most wanted
men in Africa.

52:53.271 --> 52:55.180
Now, where is he?

52:56.098 --> 52:57.263
Where is he?

52:57.264 --> 52:58.860
Tennis! Tennis!

52:59.471 --> 53:00.790
On Doctor's orders.

53:00.791 --> 53:02.271
Secure the area!

53:08.031 --> 53:09.950
What the fuck do you think you are doing?

53:09.951 --> 53:11.860
Oh, what does it look like I'm doing?

53:12.740 --> 53:13.916
Stand them down.

53:13.941 --> 53:17.135
This is an indictment
against Patrice Ganimana.

53:18.591 --> 53:20.231
It is not a warrant.

53:21.511 --> 53:22.950
It'll have to do.

53:22.951 --> 53:25.111
Apparently, he's playing tennis.

53:28.471 --> 53:29.511
Stand...

53:30.991 --> 53:32.031
...them...

53:33.231 --> 53:34.551
...down.

53:42.310 --> 53:44.310
We're blue hats, Colonel.

53:45.517 --> 53:47.597
You can't shoot until you're shot at.

53:50.831 --> 53:53.271
GUNSHOTS

53:54.871 --> 53:57.820
Who fired? Who fired?

54:16.551 --> 54:19.711
Weapon down! Weapon down!

54:21.671 --> 54:25.431
On your knees. On your knees.

54:26.791 --> 54:30.031
Who fired first? Who fired first?!

54:34.951 --> 54:38.430
Please...

54:38.431 --> 54:40.820
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

54:42.471 --> 54:45.470
Shit. Shit. Christ.

54:45.471 --> 54:48.460
Benoit. Benoit!

54:49.944 --> 54:51.424
Medic!

54:54.971 --> 54:56.931
Medic!

54:57.111 --> 54:59.230
Oh, shit.

54:59.231 --> 55:01.151
Fuck.

55:04.631 --> 55:05.991
Please...

55:15.831 --> 55:18.700
Oh, fuck. You're not Ganimana.

55:20.111 --> 55:23.791
Oh, fuck. You're not Patrice Ganimana.

55:28.031 --> 55:31.111
But I saw him. I know it.

55:35.951 --> 55:37.791
Christ!

55:49.471 --> 55:52.510
Look, I can only say what I always have,

55:52.511 --> 55:56.630
that although this place may be many
thousands of miles from the events

55:56.631 --> 56:01.910
upon which it must adjudicate,
I believe that what we do here,

56:01.911 --> 56:03.350
particularly now,

56:03.351 --> 56:07.300
when nations are turning their backs
on international responsibility,

56:07.671 --> 56:10.300
what happens here becomes all the
more important

56:10.820 --> 56:13.900
for countries that have
no recourse to justice,

56:14.311 --> 56:17.231
for people who believe that day will
never come.

56:18.551 --> 56:20.151
We're trying to make a difference.

56:22.231 --> 56:23.511
Thank you.

57:25.231 --> 57:26.871
No matter what.

57:52.404 --> 57:53.884
