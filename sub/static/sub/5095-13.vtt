Who's none of

She's just a friend.

01:20.850 --> 01:22.083
Well... what kind of friend?

01:22.085 --> 01:24.085
She just texted you

01:24.087 --> 01:25.453
All right, we like to talk.

Okay.

So she's that kind of friend.

01:49.279 --> 01:51.045
If she says no, you just...

02:44.667 --> 02:46.100
a hiring freeze
on police officers.

02:46.102 --> 02:47.301
Shortsighted,

dangerous

02:49.839 --> 02:51.506
So, "No comment

02:51.508 --> 02:53.641
Exactly.
That's how you guys do that?

People magazine

03:11.026 --> 03:13.728
Um... I didn't think you

Well, I know for a fact
Lieutenant Carver

03:16.299 --> 03:19.333

got off to a rocky start.

03:19.335 --> 03:21.135
Now she's recommending
a Medal for Valor?

03:21.137 --> 03:22.336
What the hell?

03:22.338 --> 03:24.272
Well...

03:26.075 --> 03:27.008
the heightened
security measures

03:27.010 --> 03:28.509
for the
St. Patrick's Day parade.

03:28.511 --> 03:30.812
Does he, in addition
to a hiring freeze?

03:30.814 --> 03:32.847
Well, he doesn't look at them
side by side.

meter maids and a bullhorn.

and you're telling me I
got to leave my own house?

03:44.561 --> 03:47.628
That's because your house is now
a crime scene, Mr. Bianco.

Detective Reagan and Baez.

03:48.765 --> 03:50.865

crime scene in the house

04:12.589 --> 04:14.021
I carry cash sometimes.

04:14.023 --> 04:15.456
You think that's what
he was after?

04:15.458 --> 04:17.158
How am I supposed to know?

04:19.161 --> 04:21.161

He threatened you, huh?
With what?

06:35.269 --> 06:38.637

07:32.726 --> 07:34.393
Why didn't you just tell me
this morning?

07:34.395 --> 07:36.862
Because I knew
how you'd feel about it.

07:38.766 --> 07:41.467
As I recall,
you had plenty of problems

07:41.469 --> 07:43.869
with Danny
when you were his boss.

07:43.871 --> 07:45.003
Yes, I did.

07:45.005 --> 07:47.606
But never about his commitment
or his courage.

07:47.608 --> 07:51.443
Yet you never submitted his name
for a medal before.

07:51.445 --> 07:54.213
Yes. That was an oversight.

07:55.215 --> 07:57.683
So, when you found out
you were moving on,

07:57.685 --> 07:59.885
you decided to do it then?
Actually,

07:59.887 --> 08:01.019
I thought
I was gonna get canned,

08:01.021 --> 08:02.588
so I thought
I'd go out with a bang

08:02.590 --> 08:03.789
and right a wrong.

08:03.791 --> 08:06.191
These medals are not to be used
as a parting gift.

08:06.193 --> 08:07.392
That's not what this is.

08:07.394 --> 08:09.194
It's what it sounds like.

08:09.196 --> 08:10.963
This is about what I think

08:10.965 --> 08:13.298
medals in general
are partly about.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.467
It's about
the officers' families.

08:15.469 --> 08:18.737
It's about them getting
to see their spouse

08:18.739 --> 08:21.406
or mom or dad as a hero.

08:24.811 --> 08:29.381
I'm sorry. I won't approve your
recommendation at this time.

08:36.556 --> 08:38.056
Sir,

08:38.058 --> 08:42.227
I get it that you don't want
to show favoritism to your kids,

08:42.229 --> 08:44.429
but they also
shouldn't be punished

08:44.431 --> 08:48.433
because their father happens
to be the police commissioner.

09:00.413 --> 09:02.080
Nicholas Bianco is a liar.

09:02.082 --> 09:04.249
Did you threaten him?
I don't threaten people.

09:04.251 --> 09:05.651
I actually
follow through.

09:05.653 --> 09:06.852
What does that mean?

09:06.854 --> 09:08.187
It means if I
wanted to hurt him,

09:08.189 --> 09:09.988
he'd be part of a
landfill right now.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.957
That kind of sounds a little bit
like a threat to me.

09:11.959 --> 09:12.991
I said "if""

09:12.993 --> 09:15.661
Do you know this guy?

09:15.663 --> 09:17.529
No.

09:17.531 --> 09:18.964
He tried
to kill Nick Bianco.

09:18.966 --> 09:22.067
Too bad.
That he wasn't successful.

09:22.069 --> 09:24.603
And this is
my lawyer.

09:24.605 --> 09:27.339
You have any more questions,

09:27.341 --> 09:30.042
call him, not me.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.048
Problem we're gonna have
on this case, too many suspects.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.616
The M.E. sent her report.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.651
The vic's name
was Bruce Epstein.

09:39.653 --> 09:41.286
Lived in Astoria.

09:41.288 --> 09:43.622
He was hit with three
precision shots to the chest,

09:43.624 --> 09:45.224
all within one inch
of each other.

09:45.226 --> 09:47.593
Bianco must've knew
his way around a gun.

09:47.595 --> 09:49.461
Apparently
so did Epstein.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.264
His prints came back
with a list of charges,

09:52.266 --> 09:54.032
from gun possession
to attempted murder.

09:54.034 --> 09:56.268
But his last charges were dropped.
Why?

09:56.270 --> 09:57.536
Well, it looks like

09:57.538 --> 09:59.871
the person he was accused
of attempting to murder

09:59.873 --> 10:01.540
refused to testify.

10:01.542 --> 10:03.575
Refused? Or was threatened?

10:03.577 --> 10:05.978
Let's find out.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.781
You take a look
at that case I sent you?

10:09.783 --> 10:12.851
Yeah, I did. So, Suzanne
Taylor and her boyfriend,

10:12.853 --> 10:15.354
John McVeigh, tried to rob
a 24-hour convenience store.

10:15.356 --> 10:18.323
McVeigh ended up shooting
the store clerk to death.

10:18.325 --> 10:20.158
According to the witness,
Suzanne Taylor was taking

10:20.160 --> 10:22.761
the cash from the register
while the store clerk

10:22.763 --> 10:23.763
bled to death.

10:23.764 --> 10:25.464
Taylor says she was never
in the store

10:25.466 --> 10:26.798
and didn't know
what had happened

10:26.800 --> 10:29.167
until she was arrested
with her boyfriend.

10:29.169 --> 10:30.869
Which contradicts
the witness'

10:30.871 --> 10:32.971
and the boyfriend's statements.

10:32.973 --> 10:35.841
The boyfriend died of cancer
in prison three years ago.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.776
Great.

10:37.778 --> 10:41.647
So why is she being granted
a 440 hearing now?

10:41.649 --> 10:43.882
Because the only witness,
Carmen Thompson,

10:43.884 --> 10:46.985
who I.D.'d Taylor and
McVeigh, was a crackhead.

10:46.987 --> 10:50.088
And the detective on the case,
Detective Stevens, used her

10:50.090 --> 10:53.225
for three prior trials
and two subsequent ones.

10:53.227 --> 10:54.660
You spoken to him yet?

10:54.662 --> 10:56.128
Over the phone.

10:56.130 --> 10:57.529
He's retired, living in Arizona.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.398
He said there were 900 murders
that year.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.332
Neighborhoods like that,

11:00.334 --> 11:01.900
the people who tend
to be outside

11:01.902 --> 11:03.835
late at night...
Crack addicts. I get it.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.505
But the same witness
in six trials?

11:06.507 --> 11:07.973
It does taint the witness.

11:07.975 --> 11:10.475
And it taints him
and me and the whole case.

11:10.477 --> 11:12.144
Did he have anything
to say about that?

11:12.146 --> 11:15.180
He said, "Detectives don't
decide who to prosecute."

11:15.182 --> 11:17.215
Right. ADAs do.

11:17.217 --> 11:20.385
Which means it's my fault for
not vetting the witness better.

11:20.387 --> 11:22.387
Erin, this was
12 years ago.

11:22.389 --> 11:24.790
There weren't even databases
back then for witnesses.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.391
This isn't about placing blame.

11:26.393 --> 11:28.894
Oh, that's exactly
what it's about.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.362
Do you think

11:30.364 --> 11:33.065
there's a possibility
that Suzanne Taylor is innocent?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.499
I think you had
a sloppy detective.

11:34.501 --> 11:36.835
That's not what I asked.

11:36.837 --> 11:39.971
You think there's a possibility
that she's innocent?

11:39.973 --> 11:43.408
Yes, there is.

11:53.086 --> 11:55.454
Victor Floros? Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

11:55.456 --> 11:56.955
We need to ask you
a few questions.

11:56.957 --> 11:58.223
Do I have a choice?

11:58.225 --> 12:00.625
You can do it down
at the squad room.

12:00.627 --> 12:03.161
George, take over the register.

12:09.802 --> 12:13.038
Last year, you refused
to testify against Bruce Epstein

12:13.040 --> 12:15.173
for an attempt
he made on your life.

12:15.175 --> 12:17.275
Yeah. So?
So, what happened?

12:17.277 --> 12:19.678
Why did you change your mind,
decide not to testify?

12:19.680 --> 12:21.079
Because I like breathing.

12:21.081 --> 12:22.414
What are you talking about?

12:22.416 --> 12:23.782
Look, as soon

12:23.784 --> 12:26.885
as we opened this place, the Mob
sent someone over to meet me,

12:26.887 --> 12:30.489
and tell me we had to pay them
off just to stay in business.

12:30.491 --> 12:31.456
And did you?

12:31.458 --> 12:33.392
No. I refused.

12:33.394 --> 12:35.827
That's when that guy Epstein
comes to my place

12:35.829 --> 12:39.164
and shoots right through
the window at me.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.333
Are you sure
it was him?

12:41.335 --> 12:42.667
Trust me,
when you're looking

12:42.669 --> 12:44.035
at the wrong end of a gun,

12:44.037 --> 12:46.271
your vision becomes very clear
very fast.

12:46.273 --> 12:48.473
So, you think
Epstein is in the Mob?

12:48.475 --> 12:50.709
I did some checking of my own.

12:50.711 --> 12:53.011
He's not in the Mob.

12:53.980 --> 12:57.883
He's a hit man for them.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.130
What are you
looking for?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.733
I don't know.

13:20.735 --> 13:23.803
Well, it's your third trip
without taking anything out.

13:24.515 --> 13:26.882
Oh.

13:43.366 --> 13:45.367
Something's bothering you.

13:45.369 --> 13:47.569
Not exactly.

13:49.539 --> 13:53.041
Gormley put Danny up
for the Medal for Valor.

13:53.043 --> 13:56.945
Oh, and you're afraid that it's
gonna look like favoritism?

13:56.947 --> 13:58.914
There's that.

13:58.916 --> 14:02.651
And Medal Day will turn
into a publicity event

14:02.653 --> 14:04.352
about me giving my son one,

14:04.354 --> 14:06.922
and Danny will inherit
all the backwash

14:06.924 --> 14:08.824
from cops who think
they've been passed over.

14:08.826 --> 14:10.459
The whole thing's got
three strikes

14:10.461 --> 14:12.427
against it from the jump.

14:12.429 --> 14:14.362
What would I do?

14:14.364 --> 14:16.231
I know what you would do.

14:16.233 --> 14:17.466
When you were commissioner,

14:17.468 --> 14:19.434
I didn't get a medal
or a commendation.

14:19.436 --> 14:21.369
Did you resent it?

14:21.371 --> 14:23.071
No, I understood it.

14:23.073 --> 14:24.439
So will Danny.

14:24.441 --> 14:26.608
He's not me.

14:26.610 --> 14:29.244
No, he's not.

14:29.246 --> 14:31.246
But he does
have your sense

14:31.248 --> 14:33.515
to favor the greater good.

14:36.152 --> 14:38.186
I guess I could just ask him.

14:38.188 --> 14:39.354
No.

14:39.356 --> 14:40.856
No, you can't.

14:40.858 --> 14:43.125
You can't put him
in that position.

14:47.096 --> 14:49.264
Did you ever regret it?

14:50.733 --> 14:52.934
One time.

14:54.036 --> 14:58.006
In '88, when you apprehended
that bank robber

14:58.008 --> 15:01.009
all on your own
before backup ever arrived.

15:01.011 --> 15:03.979
That was a clear case
for the Medal for Valor.

15:03.981 --> 15:05.914
Eh.

15:05.916 --> 15:09.084
Now, every time you put on
the uniform and I see a space

15:09.086 --> 15:12.621
where a medal should be,
or a commendation bar,

15:12.623 --> 15:14.756
yeah.

15:14.758 --> 15:17.125
Yeah, I have regrets.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.329
I don't have regrets, Pop.

15:21.331 --> 15:24.432
Neither will Danny.

15:35.077 --> 15:37.145
So, Bianco says
he has no idea

15:37.147 --> 15:39.815
why a professional hit man
would want to kill him.

15:39.817 --> 15:41.049
Keeps pointing to Petrov.

15:41.051 --> 15:43.819
Who, by the way,
has a record for tax evasion.

15:43.821 --> 15:46.388
Which is a long way
from murder. What do you got?

15:46.390 --> 15:47.889
I didn't get much
from Bianco's surveillance,

15:47.891 --> 15:49.357
but I did talk to a neighbor

15:49.359 --> 15:50.826
who has security cameras
around his house.

15:50.828 --> 15:52.594
I thought we could sneak a peek.
Uh-huh.

15:52.596 --> 15:54.596
But he said that
when Anna went away

15:54.598 --> 15:56.765
for the weekend with her
girlfriends last month,

15:56.767 --> 15:59.935
Bianco didn't waste any time
bringing home a hot tamale.

15:59.937 --> 16:02.070
Bianco has a girlfriend?

16:02.072 --> 16:03.471
That's what he said.

16:03.473 --> 16:06.875
Well, that would be
a motive for murder.

16:06.877 --> 16:09.978
Let's go see the missus.

16:15.151 --> 16:17.552
Ms. Thompson, according
to the witness statement,

16:17.554 --> 16:19.654
you heard three gunshots coming

16:19.656 --> 16:21.223
from within
the convenience store,

16:21.225 --> 16:23.458
and then saw two people
running from the store.

16:23.460 --> 16:24.693
Is that correct?

16:24.695 --> 16:26.127
Yes.

16:26.129 --> 16:28.330
Are either of those two people
that you identified

16:28.332 --> 16:30.265
that night here today?

16:31.133 --> 16:32.734
Yes.

16:32.736 --> 16:33.768
Where?

16:33.770 --> 16:35.837
Sitting right there.

16:35.839 --> 16:37.706
Let the record reflect

16:37.708 --> 16:40.542
that the witness has identified
Suzanne Taylor.

16:40.544 --> 16:41.810
Thank you.

16:41.812 --> 16:43.545
Your witness.

16:45.681 --> 16:48.717
Was my client
the one with the gun?

16:49.619 --> 16:50.819
No.

16:50.821 --> 16:52.020
Remind me.

16:52.022 --> 16:54.055
What was your occupation
at the time?

16:54.057 --> 16:56.124
My occupation?

16:56.126 --> 16:57.392
You were 21, an adult.

16:57.394 --> 16:59.628
What did you do for a living?
Objection. Relevance?

16:59.630 --> 17:01.529
Sustained.
Nothing.

17:01.531 --> 17:03.899
Counselor, is this
your first case?

17:03.901 --> 17:05.400
Yes, Your Honor.

17:05.402 --> 17:07.035
And a very important one.

17:07.037 --> 17:08.970
Yeah, well, keep on point.

17:08.972 --> 17:10.571
What were you doing outside

17:10.574 --> 17:12.107
the convenience store
that night?

17:13.108 --> 17:14.576
Doing crack.

17:14.578 --> 17:17.112
I'm sorry.
Can you speak up, Ms. Thompson?

17:18.214 --> 17:20.548
I was smoking crack.

17:20.550 --> 17:21.616
Are you familiar with

17:21.617 --> 17:22.884
a Detective Stevens?

17:22.886 --> 17:24.019
Yes.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.553
How many cases have
you helped him on?

17:25.555 --> 17:26.922
Objection.
Relevance?

17:26.924 --> 17:28.890
Your Honor,
I'm establishing history.

17:28.892 --> 17:30.992
I'll allow it.

17:33.596 --> 17:35.697
I helped him on a lot.

17:35.699 --> 17:36.998
What's a lot?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.434
One or two cases?

17:40.269 --> 17:41.937
About five or six.

17:41.939 --> 17:44.272
Well, you must like
helping Detective Stevens.

17:44.274 --> 17:46.074
Objection.
Leading the witness.

17:46.076 --> 17:47.375
I'll rephrase.

17:47.377 --> 17:49.311
How did you come
to help Detective Stevens

17:49.313 --> 17:50.812
on so many cases?

17:53.950 --> 17:55.951
'Cause he used to give me money.

17:55.953 --> 17:57.419
Which you'd use to buy crack.

17:57.421 --> 17:58.486
Objection!

17:58.488 --> 18:00.055
Withdrawn.

18:00.057 --> 18:02.924
No further questions.

18:12.668 --> 18:14.869
It could have easily
have been me or my husband

18:14.871 --> 18:16.838
lying right there dead.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.373
Can you think of anyone

18:18.375 --> 18:22.344
who maybe wanted to, uh,
you know, kill your husband?

18:24.046 --> 18:25.613
I thought it was a burglar

18:25.615 --> 18:27.549
looking for jewelry,
stuff like that.

18:27.551 --> 18:28.750
Well,

18:28.752 --> 18:31.786
we think it may be
of a more personal nature.

18:31.788 --> 18:33.421
Somebody who was mad
at your husband

18:33.423 --> 18:34.923
for one reason or another.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.259
Do you have any ideas
about that?

18:39.095 --> 18:40.662
No.

18:40.664 --> 18:41.963
Nick was a good husband.

18:41.965 --> 18:44.332
Nick <i>was</i> a good husband?

18:46.236 --> 18:49.237
Every marriage has
its ups and downs.

18:49.239 --> 18:50.905
What does that mean?

18:50.907 --> 18:52.640
Was he cheating on you?

18:52.642 --> 18:55.410
No. It's not like that.

18:55.412 --> 18:56.711
What is it like?

18:56.713 --> 19:00.115
Nicholas cheated on me, okay?

19:00.117 --> 19:03.184
But only after he found out
I was cheating on him.

19:03.186 --> 19:05.653
We both got busy
in our jobs,

19:05.655 --> 19:08.456
stopped paying attention
to each other.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.859
The magic was gone.

19:10.861 --> 19:12.761
Possible the man
you were having an affair with

19:12.763 --> 19:14.429
wanted to get rid
of your husband?

19:15.264 --> 19:16.698
No.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.533
I don't think so.

19:18.535 --> 19:19.801
No.

19:19.803 --> 19:21.503
Okay, tell you what.
We're gonna need

19:21.505 --> 19:24.706
the name of anybody you or your
husband had a relationship with.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.642
Okay? Anyone you may have
burned a bridge with,

19:27.644 --> 19:30.245
or could be holding
a grudge against either way.

19:30.247 --> 19:32.680
Maybe I should call my husband.
Maybe you should

19:32.682 --> 19:36.317
stop playing games,
start cooperating, okay?

19:45.795 --> 19:47.929
How come you're still awake,
kiddo?

19:48.964 --> 19:50.498
Can't sleep.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.435
Why can't you sleep?

19:53.437 --> 19:56.404
She said yes.
She said yes?

19:56.406 --> 19:57.539
Yeah.

19:57.541 --> 19:58.907
Well, that's great news.

19:58.909 --> 20:00.508
Yeah, but now what?

20:00.510 --> 20:03.011
Now you take her on a date,
you go to the movies.

20:03.013 --> 20:05.313
That's so boring.
Everyone does that.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.382
Okay.

20:07.384 --> 20:10.251
Well, do you know
what she likes to do?

20:10.253 --> 20:12.587
She likes to go ice-skating.

20:12.589 --> 20:14.089
Could I bring her ice-skating?

20:14.091 --> 20:16.958
Ice-skating sounds
like a very good plan.

20:16.960 --> 20:18.193
Thank you.

20:18.195 --> 20:19.627
You got it.

20:19.629 --> 20:20.995
Good night.

20:20.997 --> 20:23.698
Good night, kiddo.

20:27.236 --> 20:28.803
Hello.

20:28.805 --> 20:30.572
Hey.

20:31.674 --> 20:34.542
You know, you should ask
your boss for a bigger office.

20:34.544 --> 20:36.377
I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:36.379 --> 20:38.446
He can be a hard-ass sometimes.

20:38.448 --> 20:39.714
So I hear.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.049
Whenever you prowl

20:41.051 --> 20:45.019
the 14th floor and end up here
in my crowded little office,

20:45.021 --> 20:48.623
it usually means my life is
gonna become more complicated.

20:49.692 --> 20:52.393
You're sometimes good
at uncomplicating things.

20:52.395 --> 20:55.130
How about I try that now?

20:55.132 --> 20:56.664
Why don't you pretend

20:56.666 --> 20:58.199
that Danny's last name
isn't Reagan

20:58.201 --> 21:00.001
and decide
if he deserves a medal

21:00.003 --> 21:01.636
based on the merits of the case?

21:01.638 --> 21:04.806
I know he deserves it.
That's not the point.

21:04.808 --> 21:07.208
Well, try this.

21:09.679 --> 21:11.846
My father worked for Oldsmobile
all his life,

21:11.848 --> 21:13.715
as did his father.

21:13.717 --> 21:16.751
So a Moore had to drive
an Oldsmobile--

21:16.753 --> 21:19.187
a used one when he started out,

21:19.189 --> 21:22.490
a brand-new one
if he attained some success.

21:23.359 --> 21:25.160
This isn't that.

21:25.162 --> 21:26.794
It's as close as I can get.

21:26.796 --> 21:28.663
I always looked
at the Oldsmobile

21:28.665 --> 21:30.899
as a legacy
that was forced upon me,

21:30.901 --> 21:33.134
that no matter
how well I did in life,

21:33.136 --> 21:36.838
my reward would be, yes,
an Oldsmobile.

21:44.847 --> 21:46.214
So he was banging
a waitress,

21:46.216 --> 21:47.715
and she was letting
the landscaper

21:47.717 --> 21:49.150
work on more
than the garden.

21:49.152 --> 21:50.451
True love.

21:50.453 --> 21:52.887
Maybe they just got bored.
I mean, it happens.

21:52.889 --> 21:54.656
Geez, Baez, you sound
like you're advocating

21:54.658 --> 21:56.524
extramarital affairs
all of a sudden.

21:56.526 --> 21:58.626
No, I'm just saying that I
don't think their affairs

21:58.628 --> 21:59.894
were significant enough
where their lovers

21:59.896 --> 22:01.162
were willing to
kill for them.

22:01.164 --> 22:02.830
I get it.
I mean, it's not like

22:02.832 --> 22:04.165
he's taking off
with the waitress,

22:04.167 --> 22:05.633
and she's not giving up
the McMansion

22:05.635 --> 22:08.369
to go off with the guy
that mows the lawn.

22:09.205 --> 22:11.005
I knew it.

22:11.007 --> 22:13.074
I ran Bianco through SAFETNet.

22:13.076 --> 22:14.509
Guess who's looking at him.

22:14.511 --> 22:15.944
Organized Crime.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.980
OCID's got him up on a wire.

22:38.329 --> 22:40.464
What about video surveillance?

22:40.466 --> 22:43.226
Erin, it was 2003.
The video is long gone.

22:43.227 --> 22:44.326
The convenience store

22:44.328 --> 22:46.028
is a Laundromat now.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.863
What about this?

22:47.865 --> 22:49.432
Recovered at the scene.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.233
Never tested?

22:51.235 --> 22:52.702
Lab tech labeled it
insufficient evidence.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.103
Why?
I don't know.

22:54.105 --> 22:55.337
The lab tech long since retired.

22:55.339 --> 22:56.906
I haven't been able
to track him down.

22:56.908 --> 23:00.309
Get it tested. Maybe it fell
through the cracks.

23:01.645 --> 23:03.512
What else are we missing?

23:03.514 --> 23:05.514
You were second seat
on this case, Erin.

23:05.516 --> 23:07.883
What's that supposed to mean?

23:07.885 --> 23:09.452
It means
stop beating yourself up.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.153
Why are you letting this case
get to you?

23:13.990 --> 23:16.158
Why'd you become a cop?

23:16.993 --> 23:20.429
My mother was murdered
when I was 16.

23:21.231 --> 23:22.765
I'm sorry.

23:22.767 --> 23:24.233
I became a cop

23:24.235 --> 23:26.102
hoping to find out who did it.

23:26.104 --> 23:28.404
And did you find out?

23:28.406 --> 23:30.072
No.

23:33.076 --> 23:36.579
I became a lawyer
because I love the truth.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.114
That's why
this case

23:38.116 --> 23:39.882
is getting to me.

23:39.884 --> 23:42.351
Because what if the truth is
I'm responsible

23:42.353 --> 23:45.554
for a woman losing 12 years
of her life?

23:59.269 --> 24:01.303
Hey, Dad.

24:01.305 --> 24:02.538
Hey.

24:04.074 --> 24:06.308
I thought
Erin was bringing that.

24:06.310 --> 24:07.309
Yeah, well, she's preoccupied

24:07.311 --> 24:08.978
with the 440 hearing,
so she asked me.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.781
Oh. I'll call her.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.350
Yeah, you know
those calls you make, Dad,

24:14.352 --> 24:15.518
when you're pretending

24:15.520 --> 24:17.486
to be concerned
about Sunday dinner

24:17.488 --> 24:19.722
but you're really just fishing
around for how we're doing,

24:19.724 --> 24:21.257
they're very transparent.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.259
Are they, now?

24:23.261 --> 24:24.426
Mm-hmm.

24:24.428 --> 24:26.695
And what are we having?

24:26.697 --> 24:28.464
Turkey.

24:28.466 --> 24:31.066
Mmm. Well, just so you know,

24:31.068 --> 24:34.236
when you show up
with the food for Sunday dinner,

24:34.238 --> 24:36.172
it is also transparent.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.840
Oh.

24:37.842 --> 24:39.909
Right.

24:43.246 --> 24:47.183
I know Gormley threw my name
in the hopper for a medal.

24:47.185 --> 24:49.318
I told him not to.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.520
I know you did.
I just wanted you to know

24:51.522 --> 24:54.757
I told him not to
because I don't need it, Dad.

24:54.759 --> 24:57.893
And I'm sure you don't need the
publicity that comes with it.

24:57.895 --> 25:00.529
I don't care about publicity.
You shouldn't, either.

25:00.531 --> 25:03.299
Okay, well,
I hate wearing my dress blues.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.234
How about that?

25:06.870 --> 25:09.271
See you Sunday.

25:10.106 --> 25:12.074
I'm proud of you, you know.

25:12.076 --> 25:14.243
I know.

25:21.918 --> 25:25.020
Nicholas Bianco,
owner of Nicky's Cement Company,

25:25.022 --> 25:26.222
an original title
if I ever heard one.

25:26.224 --> 25:27.890
We've only been
up on him

25:27.892 --> 25:29.992
for a month,
so I don't have much for you.

25:29.994 --> 25:32.194
Is he mobbed up?
Well, not exactly.

25:32.196 --> 25:33.596
He gets hired by Fat Al

25:33.598 --> 25:35.331
to truck concrete on
rigged city contracts.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.733
We haven't gotten him
breaking the law.

25:37.735 --> 25:40.569
How about this guy?
He look familiar to you?

25:40.571 --> 25:41.937
Bruce Epstein.

25:41.939 --> 25:43.806
We think he's got at least
five bodies under his belt.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.441
We're trying to figure
out who would've hired

25:45.443 --> 25:47.643
this Epstein to kill Bianco.

25:47.645 --> 25:50.112
I don't have anything
that'll help you with that.

25:50.114 --> 25:52.281
We didn't get anything
on the wire about it.

25:52.283 --> 25:53.582
How about

25:53.584 --> 25:56.218
someone close to Epstein
who might know who hired him?

25:56.220 --> 25:58.854
We have a CI
in the Romano family,

25:58.856 --> 26:01.891
and they say that Epstein
doesn't keep any secrets

26:01.893 --> 26:03.425
from his girlfriend.

26:03.427 --> 26:06.095
That's a little unusual for
an organized crime member,

26:06.097 --> 26:07.563
especially a hit man.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.098
Aren't they sworn to secrecy?

26:09.966 --> 26:11.901
Love makes you do crazy things.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.435
Or stupid things.

26:13.437 --> 26:15.638
Got an address
on the girlfriend?

26:23.881 --> 26:25.014
Thank you.

26:25.016 --> 26:27.116
Took a guess on how you like it.
Milk, no sugar?

26:27.118 --> 26:29.251
Perfect.
Like everything else about you,

26:29.253 --> 26:30.619
no frills.

26:30.621 --> 26:33.722
I was thinking you and Justin
Taylor have a lot in common.

26:33.724 --> 26:36.158
He also got into this
field to seek justice

26:36.160 --> 26:37.793
for his mom.

26:37.795 --> 26:39.495
It's very noble.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.963
Noble and naive.

26:40.965 --> 26:42.998
Why would you say that?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.266
It means just because
he believes

26:44.268 --> 26:45.935
his mother is innocent
doesn't mean she is.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.804
These are the results of the DNA
from the cigarette

26:48.806 --> 26:51.073
found at the scene.

26:51.075 --> 26:53.108
It matches Suzanne Taylor.

26:53.977 --> 26:56.111
She was there.

27:06.122 --> 27:08.857
♪ ♪

27:08.859 --> 27:11.794
We're looking
for Valerie Traynor.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.028
I'm Valerie.

27:13.030 --> 27:14.730
Valerie, Detectives
Reagan and Baez.

27:14.732 --> 27:16.332
We need to talk.

27:17.667 --> 27:19.868
Come on to the back.

27:22.339 --> 27:25.040
Why are all these men getting
manicures on their lunch break?

27:25.042 --> 27:26.241
You're so
'70s, Reagan.

27:26.243 --> 27:28.677
Metro is the new sexy.
Metro?

27:28.679 --> 27:30.879
I like T-bones, cold beer
and loud burps.

27:30.881 --> 27:32.881
Oh, charming.

27:32.883 --> 27:34.850
So, what can I do for you?

27:34.852 --> 27:38.187
We know Bruce Epstein was a
hit man for the Romano family.

27:38.189 --> 27:40.055
We know you were
his girlfriend.

27:40.057 --> 27:41.523
Fiancée.

27:41.525 --> 27:42.925
And he also
told me never

27:42.927 --> 27:44.660
to talk to cops.
Really?

27:44.662 --> 27:46.795
So you have no interest in
finding out why he was killed?

27:46.797 --> 27:48.330
Since when
is the NYPD interested

27:48.332 --> 27:49.765
in the murder of a hit man?

27:49.767 --> 27:51.166
We need to
find out

27:51.168 --> 27:52.468
who sent him to Bianco's house,

27:52.470 --> 27:54.169
make sure he wasn't set up.

27:54.171 --> 27:56.538
And to make sure
you're not in any danger.

27:58.441 --> 28:01.577
Look, we know
he confided in you, okay?

28:01.579 --> 28:04.813
And given his profession,
that's very unusual.

28:04.815 --> 28:08.517
Well, he was... an unusual man.

28:08.519 --> 28:10.753
That's what I loved about him.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.354
I think he would
want you protected.

28:12.356 --> 28:14.089
And we can provide that for you.

28:14.091 --> 28:16.792
If you're willing
to cooperate.

28:18.595 --> 28:21.597
What do you want to know?

28:21.599 --> 28:23.432
Who sent him to kill Bianco?

28:24.300 --> 28:26.835
He wasn't there to kill Bianco.

28:26.837 --> 28:27.970
Why was he there?

28:27.972 --> 28:31.006
He was there
to kill Bianco's wife.

28:31.008 --> 28:33.409
Anna was
the target? Why?

28:33.411 --> 28:35.744
I have no idea why.

28:35.746 --> 28:38.113
Who hired him to kill her?

28:38.115 --> 28:40.716
Her husband.

29:04.934 --> 29:07.803
I'm not supposed to talk to you
without my lawyer, you know.

29:07.805 --> 29:11.240
That's right.
You don't have to talk to me.

29:11.242 --> 29:12.808
A cigarette butt

29:12.810 --> 29:16.345
was found at the crime scene
that was never tested for DNA,

29:16.347 --> 29:18.380
so I had it sent to the lab.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.782
Puts you at the scene.

29:20.784 --> 29:23.151
That doesn't mean
I killed that store clerk.

29:23.153 --> 29:26.388
That store clerk's name
was Dillon Hartin.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.390
He was
17 years old.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.793
I'm going to submit the results
as evidence.

29:31.795 --> 29:34.830
Justin should be getting it
later on this afternoon.

29:34.832 --> 29:37.799
I have an
18-year-old daughter.

29:37.801 --> 29:40.035
If I had done something stupid,

29:40.037 --> 29:43.538
broken the law years ago,
I can't imagine

29:43.540 --> 29:44.973
wanting to tell her because...

29:44.975 --> 29:46.508
Because when people
like you screw up,

29:46.510 --> 29:48.644
there's always someone there
to get you out of it.

29:48.646 --> 29:52.614
You've been lying to your son
all of these years.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.983
I never told him
to reopen the case.

29:54.985 --> 29:56.585
He did that on his own.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.121
He did that because he thinks
you're innocent.

29:59.123 --> 30:02.557
I didn't shoot Dillon Hartin.

30:02.559 --> 30:04.026
You were there.

30:04.028 --> 30:06.461
You took that money
from the store.

30:06.463 --> 30:08.430
You ran away.

30:08.432 --> 30:10.065
You tried to help
your boyfriend escape.

30:10.067 --> 30:11.867
And I've paid for it.

30:11.869 --> 30:13.101
So has Justin.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.770
What do you want from me?

30:14.772 --> 30:18.407
I want you to tell the truth.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.511
That I was high on coke?

30:22.513 --> 30:26.348
That I was so in love
with my boyfriend

30:26.350 --> 30:28.283
I'd do anything for him?

30:29.886 --> 30:31.420
Including watch him
kill that kid

30:31.422 --> 30:35.657
because he didn't get the money
out of the drawer fast enough?

30:36.492 --> 30:40.929
Is that what you want me
to tell my son?

30:42.966 --> 30:45.367
Yes.

30:47.203 --> 30:50.939
You couldn't
possibly understand.

31:02.018 --> 31:05.954
I understand that the truth
is gonna come out.

31:06.990 --> 31:10.926
You need to decide
if it's gonna come from you

31:10.928 --> 31:13.295
or me.

31:15.631 --> 31:17.632
Guard?

31:38.955 --> 31:41.323
You put out a hit
on your wife.

31:41.325 --> 31:42.758
No, I didn't.
Sure you did.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.626
Why don't you grow some balls
and stop BS'ing.

31:44.628 --> 31:46.294
What'd you say to me?

31:46.296 --> 31:47.496
What are you gonna do?

31:47.498 --> 31:49.398
You gonna put out a hit
on me next, huh?

31:49.400 --> 31:50.665
Come on, sit down.

31:52.101 --> 31:54.469
Sit down!

31:55.304 --> 31:57.472
You hired Epstein
to kill your wife.

31:57.474 --> 32:01.476
What? I never saw
that guy before in my life.

32:02.678 --> 32:04.713
Want to explain that?

32:04.715 --> 32:07.482
What the hell
did your wife do

32:07.484 --> 32:09.384
to piss you off
so much, huh?

32:09.386 --> 32:11.019
She find out
you had a girlfriend?

32:11.021 --> 32:13.622
Honest to God,
I never cheated on...

32:13.624 --> 32:15.690
Never cheated on her
until you found out

32:15.692 --> 32:17.192
she was cheating on you, right?

32:17.194 --> 32:18.593
I know about that, too.

32:18.595 --> 32:20.395
What do you know?

32:20.397 --> 32:22.330
We were 18
years old

32:22.332 --> 32:25.267
when we first met.

32:25.269 --> 32:27.669
High school sweethearts.

32:27.671 --> 32:28.970
So what happened?

32:28.972 --> 32:30.806
What happens when
you stop paying attention

32:30.808 --> 32:32.307
to your marriage?

32:32.309 --> 32:34.276
It starts to fall apart.

32:34.278 --> 32:37.913
Okay. So you thought
it would be better to just...

32:37.915 --> 32:39.614
off your wife...

32:39.616 --> 32:42.317
instead of dealing
with the state of your marriage?

32:45.021 --> 32:47.155
I hired him in anger.

32:47.157 --> 32:48.723
Right.

32:49.992 --> 32:51.993
And then I realized I...

32:51.995 --> 32:54.763
I still love her.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.798
I couldn't do it.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.767
I even tried to call it off,

32:58.769 --> 33:00.368
