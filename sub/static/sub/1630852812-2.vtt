01:36.967 --> 01:39.367
Yes, hi, you're early.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.067
Astie, it's me.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.167
Shit!

01:42.167 --> 01:43.300
What do you mean shit?

01:43.300 --> 01:44.600
I'm on my way out.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.233
What do you want?

01:46.233 --> 01:48.067
Uh, a name.

01:49.167 --> 01:51.233
Your friend who
deals in rare books.

01:51.233 --> 01:53.633
I got some first
editions from dad's shop.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.133
Thought he might be interested.

01:57.133 --> 01:58.267
Is your phone broken?

01:59.533 --> 02:00.467
You couldn't text me?

02:00.467 --> 02:03.233
Well, I was passing.

02:03.233 --> 02:04.433
And?

02:04.433 --> 02:05.267
And...

02:09.367 --> 02:10.233
Hello?

02:12.567 --> 02:13.667
Excuse me.

02:20.467 --> 02:21.833
Max, this is not a good time.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.133
Oh, no, it's Patrick.

02:24.133 --> 02:26.300
Hi, is Max still there?

02:29.133 --> 02:31.167
You mean the
bloke with he bike?

02:31.167 --> 02:32.067
No, he's gone.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.700
I'll be right now.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.433
Caio.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.433
Caio, good evening.

02:50.433 --> 02:51.233
Caio.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.367
Would you like me to
sign that for you?

02:56.467 --> 02:57.733
Yes please.

02:57.733 --> 02:59.233
Who should I make it out to?

02:59.233 --> 03:00.533
Stef, with an F.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.567
Wow.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.900
Okay, Stef with an
F, enjoy your meal.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.367
Lynn Franco.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.200
She got the keys.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.767
We agreed to the
end of the month.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.400
Yet you're still here.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.433
I need more time to
find something else.

03:27.433 --> 03:29.767
Unless you crass me
up to the big boss.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.200
Didn't think so.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
By the end of the
week, I'm serious.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.333
Sorry.

03:48.533 --> 03:50.067
Caio bella.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.067
Where have you been all day?

03:51.067 --> 03:52.200
Did you get my messages?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.767
I was running an errand.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.933
This lady I knock about with
has a big birthday next week

03:55.933 --> 03:56.767
so...

03:56.767 --> 03:57.733
Mind my own.

03:57.733 --> 04:02.200
You are so mysterious.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.533
Hey, you know the rules.

04:03.533 --> 04:05.367
No PDA's in the kitchen.

04:05.367 --> 04:06.833
Frightens the fish.

04:06.833 --> 04:09.133
Service, table 12!

04:09.133 --> 04:11.833
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.167
Okay, table 12, go, go, go!

04:15.300 --> 04:16.500
All right, getting
low on plates.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.333
Luca!

04:20.067 --> 04:21.100
Where's Luca?

04:22.100 --> 04:22.900
Luca?

04:24.167 --> 04:26.367
Luca, you bribed him
to come into work?

04:26.367 --> 04:28.700
I thought you'd like him here
for the announcement later.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.900
What, no we're not...

04:29.900 --> 04:31.167
It's too soon.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.500
I'll check the office.

04:40.633 --> 04:41.467
Luca!

04:44.400 --> 04:46.067
You promised.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.700
You agreed not to
upset your mom.

04:48.633 --> 04:50.367
I'm helping you.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.167
I know what
you're up to, Robin.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.067
Just leave me alone!

04:56.433 --> 04:57.533
Luca, please.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.067
Caio food lovers.

05:11.067 --> 05:13.500
Mrs. Romano here from
the beating heart

05:13.500 --> 05:14.900
of Romano's Restaurant.

05:19.067 --> 05:21.267
This is our head
chef, Cousin Johno.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.267
And here comes
the beautiful Beth.

05:24.267 --> 05:25.267
Hi!

05:26.900 --> 05:28.467
And our junior chef, Nicks.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.467
All right, two
shitting Pomojono,

05:31.467 --> 05:33.167
one pissing Tonnerelli.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.067
What's my name?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.067
Jack!

05:35.067 --> 05:35.900
Seriously?

05:35.900 --> 05:36.833
Oh leave that.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.167
Everyone loves an outtake.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.067
Exactly.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.567
Evening, Mrs. Cooper.

06:09.567 --> 06:10.500
Evening.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.233
It sounds like
a missing persons.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.567
Oh, okay.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.333
Morning.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.100
Oh thanks.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.733
Oh, is this decaf?

09:45.733 --> 09:48.133
Oh, yeah, my decaf.

09:48.133 --> 09:51.067
You know, so baby girl
doesn't buzz her nut off.

09:51.067 --> 09:54.067
My mom used to give
me a cup of Nescafe

09:54.067 --> 09:55.467
with my breakfast.

09:55.467 --> 09:57.100
Never did me any harm.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.000
Not that I'm advising you
how to feed your child.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.900
Yeah, not that I'm
listening to someone

10:01.900 --> 10:03.867
whose mom gave him
coffee as a kid.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.867
Missing person
is Robin Romano?

10:07.867 --> 10:09.133
29 years old.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.333
Celebrity chef by
the looks of it.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.067
You've not heard
of La Familia Romano

10:14.067 --> 10:16.100
of The King's Road?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.200
I live in Stratham.

10:18.400 --> 10:22.233
All right, so, neighbor
called it in at 23:17.

10:22.233 --> 10:25.000
Said she heard yelling
and then a loud bang.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.133
Gunshot?

10:26.133 --> 10:27.133
Patio door smashing.

10:27.133 --> 10:29.300
A few minutes later same witness

10:29.300 --> 10:32.767
saw the Romano's Mini leave
the property at speed.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.000
Didn't see a driver.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.033
Dispatch mentioned
there was blood.

10:36.033 --> 10:37.500
Yeah, first officer on
the scene spotted some

10:37.500 --> 10:38.667
on the side gate.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.900
Called us in as a precaution.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.133
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.000
Looks like there's
some spotting here, too.

10:47.867 --> 10:49.600
Do we know where the car went?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.133
Phone company pinpointed
the last three pings

10:52.133 --> 10:53.267
from the missing woman's mobile

10:53.267 --> 10:55.033
to a mast in Battersea.

10:55.033 --> 10:58.733
Final one at 01:09,
then inactive.

10:58.733 --> 10:59.500
Switched off.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.800
Assuming this is Robin
Romano's blood here

11:02.800 --> 11:04.067
and on the gate,

11:04.067 --> 11:06.067
do we know if the car
was facing the road

11:06.067 --> 11:07.600
or did it reverse out?

11:07.600 --> 11:08.433
I'll check.

11:09.433 --> 11:10.767
What about hospitals?

11:10.767 --> 11:12.767
Yeah,
they're on all that.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.400
Oh hey Pri, heard
you made the cut.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.100
Congrats, representing.

11:18.100 --> 11:20.767
What cut is that?

11:20.767 --> 11:22.200
I'll speak to the neighbor.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.400
Mrs. Romano,

11:52.867 --> 11:55.533
I'm Detective
Inspector Max Arnold.

11:55.533 --> 11:58.200
I've already explained
everything to your colleague.

12:01.067 --> 12:03.167
Well, let's start
at the beginning.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.100
When did you last see Robin?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.200
At the restaurant.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.900
She came in around six.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.200
She works there?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.300
She runs the PR.

12:13.267 --> 12:14.700
This is Mrs. Romano.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.933
That's all hers.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.233
She left around half nine.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.433
We were supposed to
come home together,

12:19.433 --> 12:22.067
but I had stuff to do.

12:22.067 --> 12:23.600
So Robin took the car.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.300
I left later about half 10.

12:27.300 --> 12:30.067
Did anybody see you leave?

12:30.067 --> 12:31.433
Maybe Johno.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.133
And there's a
camera on the front.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.600
Who's Johno?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.167
Our head chef,

12:36.167 --> 12:37.067
and my cousin.

12:38.433 --> 12:41.200
From the restaurant to
here is what, 15 minutes?

12:41.200 --> 12:44.133
Oh no. I was going
to take an Uber

12:44.133 --> 12:45.300
but I changed my mind.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.700
It was a nice night

12:46.700 --> 12:48.133
so I walked.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.733
I got back about 20 past 11.

12:50.933 --> 12:52.433
When I saw Robin wasn't here

12:52.433 --> 12:54.800
I phoned and left a message.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.100
I should have called 999.

13:01.233 --> 13:02.533
What was your instinct?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.400
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

13:09.967 --> 13:12.300
That a bird had
crashed into the glass.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.367
Bloody big bird.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.100
We tracked Robin's
phone to Battersea.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.500
Does she know anybody there?

13:23.733 --> 13:25.267
Not that I know of.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.900
What do you think
happened there?

13:28.900 --> 13:31.567
Well, I'm concerned
about the blood we found

13:31.567 --> 13:32.900
on the drive,

13:32.900 --> 13:35.533
and up on the ceiling there.

13:35.533 --> 13:36.700
I feel sick.

13:44.300 --> 13:45.133
Thank you.

13:47.467 --> 13:48.467
DI Arnold?

13:48.467 --> 13:50.700
There's a gentleman outside.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.800
Says he's family.

13:58.133 --> 13:59.167
Julie.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.400
We just got your message.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.167
Robin's missing.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.433
You've spoken to Luca?

14:07.633 --> 14:08.733
Luca?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.067
My son.

14:12.833 --> 14:17.800
It turned right, shot
off at a rate of knots.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.400
Not that I'm a curtain twitcher.

14:21.367 --> 14:23.233
But I bet a concerned
neighbor like yourself

14:23.233 --> 14:25.467
is watching out for
the police to arrive.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.467
Did you see Julia come home?

14:27.467 --> 14:28.300
No.

14:31.667 --> 14:32.500
Mrs. Cooper?

14:34.367 --> 14:38.067
There's a son, Luca,
who lived with them.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.400
Bright lad, at Catron College.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.900
But, well, where is he now?

14:44.900 --> 14:48.233
One day there, next day gone.

14:51.867 --> 14:54.700
You know what happened to
Julia Romano's husband?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.067
No.

14:58.367 --> 15:01.467
15 years ago he
disappeared too.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.567
First the husband,
then son, and now...

15:11.400 --> 15:13.233
You saw
Julia leave work?

15:13.233 --> 15:14.333
Yeah, about half 10.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.167
But you were in the
restaurant all night.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.500
Well I was on late cleanup.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.967
I left about midnight.

15:19.967 --> 15:21.667
Anyone confirm that?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.400
Yes, our waitress Beth.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.667
She was cleaning front house,

15:24.667 --> 15:27.067
she left five minutes before me.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.067
According to our system

15:29.067 --> 15:31.767
two weeks ago Robin
Romano reported a break in

15:31.767 --> 15:32.900
at this address.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.133
Then promptly withdrew
the complaint.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.333
Was that the son, Luca?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.100
He's a good kid.

15:41.067 --> 15:42.467
Did you see him last night?

15:42.467 --> 15:43.867
Briefly.

15:43.867 --> 15:45.400
He's on the roster,
but everyone knows

15:45.400 --> 15:48.133
there's only one reason that
Luca turns up for shifts.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.633
Julia kids herself that she's
molding him in her image

15:54.633 --> 15:56.133
but when I cashed up
at the end of the night

15:56.133 --> 15:57.333
we were 50 quid short.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.900
It rained yesterday afternoon

16:02.900 --> 16:05.833
so we can assume these
footprints are fresh.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.500
Size eights.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.067
And the pattern on the
sole, Adidas Superstars.

16:11.467 --> 16:12.833
I know my trainers.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.067
Tracks end at the fence,

16:18.067 --> 16:20.467
so that's the likely
point of access.

16:20.467 --> 16:21.667
Officers have searched
the neighbor's garden

16:21.667 --> 16:22.900
but didn't find anything.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.933
The neighbor confirmed
the car reversed out.

16:26.933 --> 16:29.900
Then whoever's blood
that is on the driveway

16:29.900 --> 16:31.433
didn't get in behind the wheel.

16:32.467 --> 16:34.433
We have a third party.

16:34.433 --> 16:36.500
And a possible
kidnapping or abduction.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.300
Luca dotes on Robin.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.367
He wouldn't hurt her.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.633
Luca's got quite the
collection of trainers.

16:51.633 --> 16:52.900
Can you sign here please?

16:56.500 --> 16:57.767
Thank you.

16:57.767 --> 16:58.800
We'll return them
as soon as we can.

17:00.533 --> 17:02.333
Do you know where
he's staying now?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.300
After Robin reported
the break in,

17:05.300 --> 17:07.133
how did Luca react?

17:07.133 --> 17:08.467
Well, he was angry,

17:09.933 --> 17:12.467
but they made up after he
returned the watch he stole.

17:12.467 --> 17:15.600
It was the one I gave
Robin for our anniversary.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.067
His number's not available.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.967
Shows how far we've fallen.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.967
We need to speak to him.

17:22.967 --> 17:24.367
You could try Nicks.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.067
She might know where he is.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.267
Nicks?

17:27.267 --> 17:28.600
Nicola Grieves,
our junior chef.

17:28.600 --> 17:32.067
She and Luca have
an on off thing.

17:32.067 --> 17:34.400
And what about Luca's father?

17:34.400 --> 17:38.067
Um, David in Westbury?

17:38.067 --> 17:39.600
Is he still on the scene?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.267
Why are you
asking about David?

17:41.267 --> 17:43.067
Your neighbor mentioned him.

17:43.067 --> 17:45.733
I haven't seen or spoken
to David since he walked out

17:45.733 --> 17:47.200
15 years ago.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.233
For God's sake, a gossipy
neighbor regurgitates a rumor

17:49.233 --> 17:50.467
and you take it seriously.

18:12.167 --> 18:13.667
Oh, sorry, I
forgot to lock it.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.067
We're not open yet.

18:15.067 --> 18:17.367
DS Shamsie, DI Arnold.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.067
Are you Nicola Grieves?

18:19.067 --> 18:20.867
No.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.733
Beth Dalton.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.300
Nicks isn't in yet.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.967
What's up, she in trouble?

18:25.967 --> 18:27.200
We want to talk to her.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.833
We're investigating the
disappearance of Robin Romano.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.067
God, I thought
you were joking.

18:37.067 --> 18:38.600
What's happened?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.167
There was an incident at
the Romano house last night.

18:41.167 --> 18:43.333
We need to speak to
Luca Romano about it.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.933
Oh Luca.

18:45.933 --> 18:48.200
Where there's trouble,
he's never far behind.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.467
Um, you wait here.

18:50.467 --> 18:52.267
I'll go and call Nicks.

19:04.067 --> 19:06.667
Julia Romano said
you and Luca are an item.

19:06.667 --> 19:10.100
Were, we broke up last year.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.667
When he's using it's exhausting.

19:12.667 --> 19:13.767
What's he take?

19:13.767 --> 19:14.867
Nothing serious.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.333
Did you see him last night?

19:17.333 --> 19:21.067
Yeah, but thankfully rarely
bothers to show up for shift.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.367
Did he used to talk to
you about things at home?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.067
Oh, did he.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.400
He's always minding about
his hard knock life.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.533
He was having problems?

19:31.533 --> 19:33.733
Of his own making.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.933
And last year on his 21st,

19:35.933 --> 19:38.600
his mom offered in
this place to takeover,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.100
to manage.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.533
Like, I'd give my right arm,

19:42.967 --> 19:44.067
but he turned it down.

19:46.567 --> 19:49.533
Did Julia or Robin pressure
him to change his mind?

19:49.533 --> 19:51.067
Good luck with that.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.800
Last night, did you see
anything out of the ordinary?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.367
No.

19:57.367 --> 20:00.700
Oh, but Lynn Franco,
the delivery guy,

20:00.700 --> 20:02.500
he's got a hold of Robin.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.267
She handed him his
cards last week.

20:07.700 --> 20:08.533
Either of you got a light?

20:08.533 --> 20:09.367
No.

20:10.233 --> 20:11.167
No.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.900
Do you have a number for Luca?

20:20.300 --> 20:21.733
Is this the only
number you have?

20:21.733 --> 20:23.900
It's the one he used
when we were a thing.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.100
Look, are we done?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.433
I'm on practice.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.167
Oh, nice trainers.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.333
Okay thanks.

20:35.900 --> 20:36.867
Louboutin.

20:38.067 --> 20:39.200
Laboot what?

20:40.467 --> 20:41.267
Philistine.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.133
It's no thing.

20:46.133 --> 20:48.100
I turned up late a couple times.

20:48.100 --> 20:49.700
Robin has given to
the end of this week

20:49.700 --> 20:51.467
to book up or clear out.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.100
Was it normal for
her to borrow the van?

20:58.000 --> 20:59.100
She's the owner's misses.

20:59.100 --> 21:00.867
Me, lowly delivery driver.

21:00.867 --> 21:03.100
If she wants to borrow the van

21:03.100 --> 21:04.167
she borrows the van.

21:05.867 --> 21:06.800
How did she seem?

21:07.633 --> 21:08.967
Happy go lucky.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.533
Robin loves attention.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.333
Probably what this is all about.

21:12.333 --> 21:13.333
Attention.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.167
Not a fan?

21:14.167 --> 21:15.267
She's a gold digger.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.400
Your last delivery, 23:02?

21:21.533 --> 21:23.167
Stones throw away
from the Romano house.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.067
Yeah, and the night before

21:25.067 --> 21:26.300
finish the street over.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.267
Night before that,
round the corner.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.167
You must have been annoyed
when Robin fired you.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.533
Oh yeah.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.067
'Cause this is my dream job.

21:39.567 --> 21:40.400
Lynn Franco.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.067
Are you a Romano?

21:43.867 --> 21:44.667
No.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.267
But you're Italian, right?

21:48.267 --> 21:49.933
My mom was born in Milan.

21:49.933 --> 21:50.933
Oh Milan?

21:50.933 --> 21:51.900
I love Milan.

21:51.900 --> 21:52.700
What part?

21:54.067 --> 21:56.667
Oh uh... south.

22:02.067 --> 22:03.967
Yeah, Johno
locked up after me,

22:03.967 --> 22:06.067
just before midnight.

22:09.533 --> 22:12.367
What's the kitchen
gossip, Beth?

22:12.367 --> 22:13.867
You must all talk.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.800
Does Robin put anyone's back up?

22:18.067 --> 22:19.567
Everybody gets on with Robin.

22:21.067 --> 22:24.067
I just wish you'd tell me if
there was something wrong.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.300
Oh bloody hell!

22:27.167 --> 22:29.333
I'm sorry, sorry.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.333
It's okay.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.367
Has she talked to you
about tensions at home?

22:36.100 --> 22:36.933
Luca.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.300
You know he steals
from the till.

22:44.467 --> 22:45.933
What about Robin and Julia?

22:47.267 --> 22:50.767
The harmonious
Mrs. and Mrs. Romano?

22:50.767 --> 22:51.567
No way.

22:52.867 --> 22:55.067
Does the name David
Westbury every come up?

22:56.433 --> 22:57.800
Julia's ex-husband.

22:59.733 --> 23:03.500
It's before my time,
but it's no secret.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.867
23:19 Robin's car
was captured on CCTV

23:19.867 --> 23:21.467
heading west on
the Brompton Road,

23:21.467 --> 23:23.167
in the direction
of the hospital.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.833
It was not seen on
the traffic cams

23:24.833 --> 23:26.100
in the hospital approach though.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.500
Then where did it go?

23:27.500 --> 23:28.967
Well from the E-Link Mass Data

23:28.967 --> 23:31.400
it traveled on the
A 40 to Oxbridge.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.533
I've requested ANPR data.

23:33.533 --> 23:35.267
What's that?

23:35.267 --> 23:36.200
Is that our case?

23:36.200 --> 23:37.567
Patrick Thompson?

23:37.567 --> 23:40.300
No, it's Astrid's new fella.

23:41.233 --> 23:43.233
I bumped into him outside hers

23:43.233 --> 23:46.133
and kind of accidentally
ran his plates.

23:47.367 --> 23:49.667
Using Holmes to stalk
your ex's new squeeze?

23:50.967 --> 23:52.600
That's a good look, Max.

23:52.600 --> 23:56.167
Okay, according to NPS,
Julia Romano never reported

23:56.167 --> 23:57.733
her ex-husband missing.

23:57.733 --> 24:00.300
I couldn't find any social
media presence for him.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.900
No updates to his HMRC
records since October 2006.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.200
What about immigration?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.300
Nothing.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.833
So he really did disappear?

24:11.533 --> 24:15.633
In 2015 Julia Ramona was
granted a divorce in absentia.

24:15.633 --> 24:17.433
She married Robin
three years later.

24:19.067 --> 24:20.400
Jealous ex husband

24:20.400 --> 24:23.067
turns up out of the
blue 15 years later.

24:25.900 --> 24:29.133
Or Robin asked too
many questions about him.

24:30.567 --> 24:32.533
I mean, you saw Julie's reaction

24:32.533 --> 24:34.133
when I mentioned David Westbury.

24:36.067 --> 24:38.433
Julia pushes Robin
into the window.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.267
Robin cuts herself on the glass,

24:40.267 --> 24:41.767
runs to the car and escapes.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.067
Blood on the ceiling.

24:46.233 --> 24:47.800
So likely she was
attacked first.

24:49.300 --> 24:51.433
Julia carries her to the car,

24:51.433 --> 24:53.633
drives her to hospital,
but it's too late.

24:53.633 --> 24:55.633
Well, what time did
the Marston Ealing

24:55.633 --> 24:57.100
last detect Robin's phone?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.600
Uh, 23:48.

25:04.667 --> 25:07.067
By which time uniforms had
been at the Romano residence

25:07.067 --> 25:09.100
speaking to Julia
for 20 minutes.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.200
You can't place
Julia in that car.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.067
Unless she had an accomplice.

25:13.567 --> 25:14.400
Connor?

25:14.400 --> 25:15.267
Got it, boss.

25:15.267 --> 25:16.200
Got what?

25:16.200 --> 25:17.700
From the door to door.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.300
The resident said a black
Mini nearly ran him over

25:20.300 --> 25:21.733
on his way home from the pub.

25:22.733 --> 25:24.633
You found the car?

25:24.633 --> 25:28.100
Uh huh, near Sheep
Cut Lane, Battersea.

25:28.100 --> 25:32.367
Nobody inside, no visible
drag marks or shoe prints.

25:32.367 --> 25:35.067
Okay, full lift for
forensic examination.

25:38.533 --> 25:40.633
There's blood on
the passenger seat.

25:41.933 --> 25:44.733
Looks like the
passenger started seated

25:44.733 --> 25:46.067
and then slid down.

25:47.733 --> 25:49.900
Foot mats soaked
through with water.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.467
Looks like the driver
wiped everything down.

25:59.267 --> 26:00.633
Lemon fresh?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.067
Alpine meadow.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.067
Where are we on Luca?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.267
Nicks gave us the
names of his mates.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.767
But none of them have seen him.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.900
Hair found in the
boot of the car,

26:20.900 --> 26:22.167
pulled out at the roots.

26:24.500 --> 26:28.433
Lab results returned a
match for Robin Romano.

26:28.433 --> 26:29.933
That was quick.

26:31.867 --> 26:33.900
The boot of the
Mini is too small

26:33.900 --> 26:34.833
to fit a body,

26:34.833 --> 26:35.967
so could be off the weapon.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.600
When we've removed
the wet foot mat

26:41.067 --> 26:43.467
we found this pendant.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.267
Ran it through lab analysis,
but it didn't put out

26:45.267 --> 26:46.100
anything useful.

26:47.567 --> 26:50.400
But we inspected something
under the wiper, hold on.

26:54.933 --> 26:57.233
Where was the cut you made?

26:57.233 --> 26:58.100
Hum?

26:58.100 --> 26:59.200
That Jess mentioned.

27:02.467 --> 27:05.100
Can't remember my kid's
name but you remember that.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.333
Ha ha ha, you made the team.

27:12.333 --> 27:13.167
- Yeah.
- Great.

27:15.067 --> 27:15.833
Not great.

27:19.233 --> 27:20.600
Veteran.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.067
If you were a footballer,

27:22.067 --> 27:24.767
40 is still young.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.500
No.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.067
I thought winch green could
be the corner of a flyer,

27:33.633 --> 27:34.933
but it's a parking ticket.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.700
Mrs. Romano,
thank you for coming.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.100
So I guess
you've seen it too then?

27:47.100 --> 27:48.167
Seen what?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.067
The email here.

27:50.067 --> 27:51.233
What email?

27:51.233 --> 27:52.933
Oh, it came to you
about an hour ago.

27:52.933 --> 27:54.367
It's, it's from Robin.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.400
Don't worry, I'm okay.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.233
I'm so sorry.

27:59.233 --> 28:00.333
What a mess.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.867
I can explain everything.

28:01.867 --> 28:03.700
Column Gardens
tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

28:03.700 --> 28:04.500
Come alone.

28:05.700 --> 28:09.100
Does anyone else have
access to Robin's email?

28:09.100 --> 28:10.733
Nobody ever, I
certainly don't.

28:14.267 --> 28:17.100
Mrs. Romano, we
have some news.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.767
We found your car
left in Battersea.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.067
There was no sign of Robin.

28:24.067 --> 28:25.667
But we have to inform you

28:25.667 --> 28:30.533
that we found blood and
hair inside the car.

28:30.533 --> 28:33.633
Oh God!

28:33.633 --> 28:35.833
And preliminary tests suggest

28:35.833 --> 28:38.200
that both the hair and the
samples taken from your house

28:38.200 --> 28:39.300
are a match.

28:40.533 --> 28:41.567
It's Robin's.

28:44.833 --> 28:47.100
But you think
she's still alive?

28:49.633 --> 28:50.500
We don't know.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.667
This was found on
the floor of the car.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.067
Do you recognize it?

28:59.267 --> 29:00.133
No.

29:04.267 --> 29:05.833
I've been building a picture

29:05.833 --> 29:08.133
of Robin's movements yesterday.

29:08.133 --> 29:09.867
It looks like she
was at the restaurant

29:09.867 --> 29:11.767
until around 3:00 PM.

29:11.767 --> 29:13.767
Then drove to Hammersmith.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.900
Do you know what
she was doing there?

29:17.700 --> 29:20.133
She's been being
secretive all week,

29:20.133 --> 29:22.400
but there's an
innocent explanation.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.067
Next week is my 50th birthday.

29:26.167 --> 29:28.867
I think Robin has been
planning something.

29:28.867 --> 29:33.300
Your car was also driven
to Oxbridge last night.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.933
Is there any reason why Robin
or Luca would travel there?

29:44.200 --> 29:47.167
According to Robin's
internet search history,

29:47.167 --> 29:49.400
she was trying to track
down your ex-husband.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.467
What?

29:50.467 --> 29:52.233
Did you know that?

29:52.233 --> 29:57.233
No.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.267
Max, I've checked the
financials for Robin Romano.

30:05.267 --> 30:06.833
The restaurant had
a bumpy few years,

30:06.833 --> 30:08.633
but it's back in the black now.

30:08.633 --> 30:10.133
Enough to warrant
a kidnapping?

30:10.133 --> 30:11.367
No.

30:11.367 --> 30:14.300
But Robin Romano's
savings account.

30:14.300 --> 30:18.933
Last November, she deposited
300,000 pounds into it.

30:18.933 --> 30:20.400
Only it didn't stay for long.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.800
Over four months

30:21.800 --> 30:24.367
there were multiple
payments all via PayPal,

30:24.367 --> 30:27.200
Pay and A, Google Pay
Send, Western Union.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.700
So no way to trace the
recipient or recipients.

30:30.700 --> 30:32.233
Random amounts too.

30:32.233 --> 30:34.367
A few thousand here,
a few hundred there.

30:34.367 --> 30:36.000
300 grand, where's that from?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.933
Flora helping me trace it.

30:41.967 --> 30:44.200
Boss, got a hit on
that parking ticket.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.767
Issued from a private firm
by an overeager operative.

30:48.767 --> 30:50.433
It's CPA parking.

30:50.433 --> 30:54.533
At a quarter past midnight
in a car park near Oxbridge.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.300
There's no cameras
on the approach road.

31:27.300 --> 31:28.633
There's blood.

31:32.367 --> 31:33.500
Veers into the woods.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.067
Better get a search team.

31:45.767 --> 31:49.833
What I wouldn't give for
an innocent explanation.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.167
Maybe tomorrow morning

31:53.167 --> 31:57.067
Robin will turn up to meet
Julia with a brilliant excuse.

31:57.067 --> 31:58.867
Ever the optimist.

32:00.067 --> 32:00.767
Yeah.

32:11.733 --> 32:13.767
The foot well in the
Mini was saturated.

32:17.067 --> 32:18.567
Yeah, soaked through.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.567
We passed a lake
on the way here.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.600
So who wrote that email?

33:45.333 --> 33:46.867
Can I see her?

33:47.767 --> 33:49.400
Of course.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.767
We'll be in touch as soon
as we can arrange it.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.367
I need to let people know.

33:57.867 --> 33:59.500
Mrs. Romano,

33:59.500 --> 34:01.100
I'm sorry to ask this,

34:01.100 --> 34:04.333
but could we keep this between
ourselves for a while longer?

34:06.300 --> 34:07.267
What?

34:08.700 --> 34:10.833
Well, we know the email
came from Robin's phone.

34:10.833 --> 34:14.067
It was reactivated
briefly earlier today.

34:14.067 --> 34:15.800
It pinged the
Marston Chelsea wall.

34:15.800 --> 34:16.767
And if there's a chance,

34:16.767 --> 34:18.633
no matter how small,

34:18.633 --> 34:21.400
that whoever sent it might
still show up tomorrow.

34:23.067 --> 34:24.767
Whatever I can do.

34:24.767 --> 34:25.767
Thank you.

34:27.067 --> 34:28.633
There's something else.

34:28.633 --> 34:30.100
But if you'd rather we'd...

34:30.100 --> 34:32.667
Go ahead, ask what
you need to ask.

34:32.667 --> 34:36.367
Looking into Robin's
financial history,

34:36.367 --> 34:40.267
someone transferred 300,000
pounds into a savings account

34:40.267 --> 34:41.600
last November.

34:41.600 --> 34:46.533
Robin used to co-own
a PR firm, Hillside PRP.

34:46.533 --> 34:48.733
Maybe it was a windfall.

34:48.733 --> 34:51.400
All but 5,000 was
transferred out.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.467
Do you know where?

34:52.467 --> 34:53.800
I have no idea.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.067
We kept our finances separate.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.600
I didn't keep track
of her spending.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.767
Hello?

35:33.633 --> 35:36.167
Whoever's out there,
I've called the police.

35:41.067 --> 35:43.633
Bloody hell, nearly
gave me a heart attack!

35:43.633 --> 35:44.467
What are you doing?

35:44.467 --> 35:45.300
Nothing.

35:48.567 --> 35:50.200
Did you call the police?

35:50.200 --> 35:53.700
No, but they're
looking for you.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.600
They think you were at the
house Friday night, were you?

35:58.933 --> 36:03.200
Luca, did you have something
to do with Robin going missing?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.233
Is that what mom thinks?

36:04.233 --> 36:06.233
Your mother is in bits.

36:06.233 --> 36:08.067
Let her think what she wants.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.300
Don't tell anyone I was here.

36:15.267 --> 36:16.100
Wait.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.433
Wait, wait, wait.

36:29.433 --> 36:30.267
Come here.

36:37.067 --> 36:39.067
Be careful, okay?

36:39.067 --> 36:40.067
- Thanks.
- Go on.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.200
That was my first
foray into publishing.

37:10.233 --> 37:12.300
Printed those little
recipe books ourselves.

37:14.833 --> 37:18.367
Me and Luca stapling
pages in the kitchen.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.800
We sold them to customers
for five pounds a pop.

37:23.833 --> 37:24.867
You signed my copy.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.733
Did I?

37:31.233 --> 37:32.100
Why here?

37:33.233 --> 37:34.800
This is one of
our favorite places.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.067
The cruelty in
sending that email.

37:45.767 --> 37:46.600
It's time.

37:48.167 --> 37:49.233
You all right?

38:22.933 --> 38:25.500
Won't they know
we found the body?

38:25.500 --> 38:28.100
Press office is
sitting on it until six.

38:32.767 --> 38:35.300
Do we know what Robin
was doing in Hammersmith

38:35.300 --> 38:36.567
the day she died?

38:36.567 --> 38:37.933
Anything come from
the door to door?

38:37.933 --> 38:39.867
We canvassed the
cafes just in case

38:39.867 --> 38:41.467
Robin was meeting someone there,

38:42.700 --> 38:43.667
but no one saw her.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.300
Sorry, I thought my
phone was on silent.

38:58.633 --> 39:01.767
Girlfriend placing a
takeaway order for tonight.

39:01.767 --> 39:02.600
How is Becky?

39:04.500 --> 39:06.400
Yeah, really good, thanks.

39:08.667 --> 39:09.500
Talent.

39:35.133 --> 39:36.300
Julia Romano?

39:36.300 --> 39:37.233
That's it, go, go!

39:37.233 --> 39:38.667
I'm sorry, this is for David.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.500
David?

39:40.667 --> 39:42.067
Police!

39:42.067 --> 39:43.133
What's going on?

39:43.133 --> 39:44.067
Step away.

39:44.067 --> 39:44.867
What are you doing?

39:44.867 --> 39:45.900
She said David.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.133
My husband.

39:47.133 --> 39:48.900
I just bought if for
my husband's birthday.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.600
I was going to ask
her to sign it.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.267
Our apologies, madame.

39:59.267 --> 40:00.667
Yeah, unbelievable.

40:04.167 --> 40:07.267
That email, it was meant
to get her out the house.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.400
Police, if anyone is in
here, make yourself known.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.367
The door panel's
been ripped off.

40:48.700 --> 40:49.733
Brown field's clear.

40:51.800 --> 40:53.867
And there's jewelry
and cash upstairs

40:53.867 --> 40:55.400
that hasn't been taken.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.267
Is there anything in here
missing or out of place?

40:59.267 --> 41:00.633
No.

41:00.633 --> 41:02.567
I'll get a team
in, check for prints.

41:21.133 --> 41:22.400
In the park

41:23.600 --> 41:25.600
you thought that woman
was delivering a message

41:25.600 --> 41:27.100
from your ex-husband David.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.367
I panicked, that's all.

41:34.667 --> 41:35.833
It was all her idea.

41:35.833 --> 41:39.667
The book making us famous.

41:39.667 --> 41:42.833
I hired her to find a way
to save the restaurant,

41:44.367 --> 41:46.667
but I quickly fell
in love with her.

41:46.667 --> 41:50.067
She was brilliant.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.633
She saved more than
the restaurant.

41:52.633 --> 41:54.067
I hope she knew that.

41:55.900 --> 41:57.433
I'm sure she did.

42:00.700 --> 42:01.500
Thank you.

42:02.733 --> 42:04.833
If I think of anything,
I'll let you know.

42:08.267 --> 42:09.267
Of course.

42:19.833 --> 42:21.500
Ciao, this
is Robin Romano.

42:21.500 --> 42:23.067
Please leave a
message after the beep

42:23.067 --> 42:24.633
and I'll get back to you pronto.

42:26.433 --> 42:28.100
Ciao, this is Robin Romano.

42:28.100 --> 42:29.667
Please leave a
message after the beep

42:29.667 --> 42:31.267
and I'll get back to you pronto.

42:35.433 --> 42:38.067
The report is probably
washed away our chances

42:38.067 --> 42:41.633
of getting useful fibers or DNA.

42:41.633 --> 42:43.067
How long was she in there?

42:44.233 --> 42:46.667
Very little in the
way of skin changes.

42:46.667 --> 42:49.333
Not too long, maybe
six to 12 hours.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.200
Any water in the lungs?

42:54.133 --> 42:55.400
Dead before she went in.

42:56.767 --> 42:57.900
Small messes.

43:00.567 --> 43:02.467
Frontal temporal fracture

43:04.233 --> 43:07.733
caused by blunt trauma
with a heavy object.

43:07.733 --> 43:08.900
Any idea what?

43:12.600 --> 43:14.500
Ashley, I said any idea--

43:14.500 --> 43:15.633
I heard.

43:15.633 --> 43:17.933
This is my concentration face.

43:17.933 --> 43:20.600
There's a patterned
bruise in the skin

43:20.600 --> 43:21.867
overlying the fracture,

43:21.867 --> 43:25.600
small indentations close
together, like dimples.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.567
I have never been
in your kitchen,

43:28.567 --> 43:30.467
But I imagine you don't own one.

43:30.467 --> 43:32.967
Incredibly presumptuous.

43:32.967 --> 43:33.833
Actually--

43:33.833 --> 43:34.933
Actually.

43:34.933 --> 43:35.967
My kids say it just like that

43:35.967 --> 43:37.867
before they make something up.

43:38.767 --> 43:40.500
Actually, Astrid had one.

43:42.567 --> 43:46.500
Well, we didn't find one
in our search of the house.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.700
That's what killed
Mrs. Romano here?

43:50.700 --> 43:52.433
Cerebral contusions.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.700
Severe extra jaw hemorrhage.

43:56.733 --> 43:58.567
Four right?

43:58.567 --> 43:59.500
Four what?

43:59.500 --> 44:00.833
Kids.

44:00.833 --> 44:03.133
When I left this morning.

44:03.133 --> 44:05.800
Love them to bits but thank
God I have an off switch.

44:07.367 --> 44:08.367
And are they--

44:08.367 --> 44:09.367
No.

44:09.367 --> 44:10.400
Not one of them.

44:10.400 --> 44:12.067
What are the odds.

44:13.900 --> 44:14.833
Sorry I thought you meant--

44:14.833 --> 44:15.700
Oh no.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.400
Are they boys or girls?

44:18.400 --> 44:20.433
Oh, sorry.

44:20.433 --> 44:22.600
Yes, four boys.

44:23.567 --> 44:24.767
What are the odds, eh?

44:30.433 --> 44:32.200
Ashley, just to be clear,

44:34.367 --> 44:36.267
we are talking about
one of those hammers

44:36.267 --> 44:38.433
you use on steaks, right?

44:47.400 --> 44:49.067
Caio food lovers,

44:49.067 --> 44:50.700
Mrs. Romano here.

44:50.700 --> 44:54.400
Tonight is the launch
party for our new cookbook.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.233
Caio food lovers!

45:00.333 --> 45:03.233
Caio food lovers.

45:03.233 --> 45:05.233
Caio food lovers!

45:05.233 --> 45:07.600
Is your volume button broken?

45:07.600 --> 45:09.667
Cookbook.

45:37.833 --> 45:40.067
The murder weapon.

47:42.200 --> 47:43.200
Hey, you say bolt.

47:45.900 --> 47:47.467
This is a surprise.

47:50.133 --> 47:51.300
Sweaty kiss.

47:51.300 --> 47:52.100
Oh sorry.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.600
So, so?

47:59.233 --> 48:00.133
Date night.

48:02.667 --> 48:03.500
I forgot.

48:03.500 --> 48:04.333
Yeah, that I realized.

48:04.333 --> 48:06.467
You're mad at me?

48:06.467 --> 48:08.533
You're mad at me.

48:08.533 --> 48:10.267
You know on the way over here

48:11.200 --> 48:13.100
I rehearsed a speech.

48:13.100 --> 48:14.567
Ooh.

48:14.567 --> 48:17.233
Ooh, a speech.

48:17.233 --> 48:19.167
Yeah, the crux
of which was that

48:19.167 --> 48:22.300
I was sorely
disappointed and hungry.

48:23.967 --> 48:25.933
And now I'm here,
I'm just hungry.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.067
You know,

48:32.767 --> 48:34.400
They serve pizza in the bar.

48:36.767 --> 48:37.600
Is it any good?

48:38.700 --> 48:39.767
I mean it's edible.

48:41.667 --> 48:42.500
That'll do.

48:43.667 --> 48:47.067
And something with meat
for me, and margarita?

48:47.067 --> 48:48.100
I love you.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.167
Yeah, whatever.

49:54.733 --> 49:57.933
Security footage
shows Luca Romano

49:57.933 --> 50:01.567
leaving the restaurant at 19:05.

50:05.733 --> 50:08.500
Robin Romano seems
upset with him.

50:29.267 --> 50:30.133
Bollocks!

50:59.267 --> 51:01.233
Thank you for coming
in, Mr. Thompson.

51:02.867 --> 51:04.367
We'll try to keep this brief.

51:04.367 --> 51:06.967
Where were you between
11 and midnight on Friday?

51:08.967 --> 51:10.367
Friday, let's see.

51:12.100 --> 51:14.100
Early evening I
had an engagement

51:14.100 --> 51:15.767
with a gallery owner I know.

51:20.533 --> 51:21.400
And after that?

51:22.733 --> 51:24.967
I was at my office
until the early hours

51:24.967 --> 51:25.900
with my legal team.

51:26.800 --> 51:28.367
I'll give you their details.

51:28.367 --> 51:29.200
Thank you.

51:30.767 --> 51:33.200
Except you weren't there
all evening, were you?

51:36.633 --> 51:40.400
Because this is you
at 20:43 on Friday

51:41.933 --> 51:44.400
leaving La Familia
Romano restaurant.

51:50.133 --> 51:51.500
Oh.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.300
Yes, oh.

51:55.133 --> 51:57.233
Maybe you can explain
that to us, Mr. Thompson.

51:57.233 --> 51:58.500
What were you doing there?

52:08.800 --> 52:11.433
DS Shamsie, kindly
request a search warrant

52:11.433 --> 52:13.200
for Mr. Thompson's properties.

52:14.767 --> 52:15.733
There's no need.

52:15.733 --> 52:17.100
Why were you there?

52:17.100 --> 52:19.400
And why did you just lie to us?

52:20.733 --> 52:22.600
I didn't want to
scupper anything.

52:24.067 --> 52:26.067
The contracts are ready to go.

52:26.067 --> 52:27.367
What contracts?

52:27.367 --> 52:28.433
For the restaurant.

52:29.600 --> 52:32.100
On Friday I was there
finalizing the details.

52:32.100 --> 52:34.067
What details?

52:35.800 --> 52:38.100
I'm in the process
of purchasing it.

52:44.400 --> 52:47.500
Julia Romano is selling
you her family business?

52:48.467 --> 52:49.500
Yeah.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.700
And I'm planning
to franchise it.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.567
How much
is that deal worth?

52:54.733 --> 52:56.333
Around 3.5.

52:59.733 --> 53:00.933
Million.

53:00.933 --> 53:02.833
Yes, thank you.

53:02.833 --> 53:03.833
It's hot property.

53:04.933 --> 53:06.400
Half a million followers.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.300
Runaway bestseller.

53:08.300 --> 53:09.500
Now all this publicity.

53:09.500 --> 53:10.700
I mean...

53:10.700 --> 53:12.500
How did Robin
feel about the sale?

53:12.500 --> 53:14.700
Did she try to stop it?

53:14.700 --> 53:15.933
Not at all.

53:15.933 --> 53:17.500
Look, I'm not forcing
anyone's hand here.

53:18.900 --> 53:21.733
Julia and Robin were both
completely behind it.

53:34.300 --> 53:37.833
So are we going to discuss
the elephant in the room?

53:37.833 --> 53:40.067
What, your OAP race?

53:40.067 --> 53:41.633
You're walking.

53:41.633 --> 53:42.967
You're the youngest
in your heat.

53:42.967 --> 53:45.300
How do you know
I'm the youngest?

53:45.300 --> 53:46.500
Oh, Jess.

53:49.167 --> 53:50.567
So you're gonna cheer me on?

53:52.633 --> 53:53.833
You bloody are.

53:55.867 --> 53:59.300
So what about the
other elephant?

53:59.300 --> 54:00.967
What did you think of him?

54:00.967 --> 54:02.667
He's bloody gorgeous.

54:03.667 --> 54:04.600
Max, I'm kidding.

54:04.600 --> 54:06.300
I knew that.

54:06.300 --> 54:07.467
Kidding.

54:07.467 --> 54:10.267
Pri, I've been running
background checks

54:10.267 --> 54:11.833
on the restaurant staff.

54:11.833 --> 54:14.800
Came across something you
might find interesting.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.933
The P60 for Lynn Franco Astori.

54:20.467 --> 54:21.300
Uh huh.

54:28.067 --> 54:29.100
Robin Romano?

54:30.400 --> 54:31.400
That's me.

54:40.900 --> 54:42.567
Sign here, please.

54:47.800 --> 54:49.233
Where do you want them?

54:49.233 --> 54:51.467
Uh, just over here please.

55:05.067 --> 55:07.800
I didn't want the staff
knowing till it was a done deal.

55:07.800 --> 55:10.433
Mr. Thompson promised that
he would keep them all on.

55:14.167 --> 55:15.300
It was the last resort.

55:16.733 --> 55:20.700
I'd hoped it might inspire
Luca to turn things around,

55:20.700 --> 55:21.900
to bring us close again.

55:25.067 --> 55:29.200
Spent my life trying
to save the restaurant,

55:29.200 --> 55:31.700
battling against the tearing
down of old Chauncey.

55:34.833 --> 55:36.533
Promised my father
I'd never sell.

55:38.733 --> 55:40.800
I did the same with
my dad's book shop.

55:42.933 --> 55:44.400
The last of their kind.

55:50.100 --> 55:52.100
We were going traveling.

55:53.233 --> 55:54.233
That was the plan.

56:02.833 --> 56:04.533
I'll see if they're ready.

57:18.067 --> 57:19.067
Hello, you've reached Astrid.

57:19.067 --> 57:20.967
Please leave a message.

57:22.300 --> 57:25.133
Hi Astie, it's me.

57:29.100 --> 57:31.467
I was hoping to catch you.

57:33.767 --> 57:34.700
The thing is...

57:41.067 --> 57:46.067
The thing is...

57:50.133 --> 57:50.967
Nevermind.

57:55.567 --> 57:57.433
There's another reason
why I didn't tell you

57:57.433 --> 57:59.533
about the restaurant sale.

57:59.533 --> 58:02.200
My ex-husband is still
on the paperwork.

58:02.200 --> 58:03.600
He has a stake in the business,

58:03.600 --> 58:04.900
and I don't want him benefiting

58:04.900 --> 58:07.533
from what Robin and
I built together.

58:07.533 --> 58:09.067
Do you know where he is now?

58:13.067 --> 58:15.700
15 years ago I was
working every hour

58:15.700 --> 58:17.433
trying to keep the
restaurant open.

58:18.633 --> 58:22.233
I came home one day,
and David was gone.

58:25.633 --> 58:26.800
Luca was seven.

58:29.133 --> 58:31.067
His father left without a note,

58:32.067 --> 58:32.933
never called.

58:34.433 --> 58:36.433
Took the best part of two years,

58:36.433 --> 58:39.300
but I found him living outside
Cork under a different name.

58:39.300 --> 58:40.733
His mother's maiden name.

58:40.733 --> 58:42.067
As far as I know,
he's still there,

58:42.067 --> 58:43.567
alive and well

58:43.567 --> 58:45.967
living with this partner
and their three daughters.

58:50.467 --> 58:52.800
I begged him to call Luca.

58:55.133 --> 58:56.900
Every Christmas and birthday

58:58.067 --> 59:02.300
I would buy Luca present
and sign it from dad.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.300
False hope.

59:08.400 --> 59:09.400
I'm good at that.

59:13.233 --> 59:14.700
Robin was too.

59:14.700 --> 59:17.333
I think she was helping
Luca try to find his father.

59:19.400 --> 59:21.067
She didn't know the truth.

59:26.267 --> 59:27.800
How do I explain to Luca that,

59:29.333 --> 59:30.967
for his father,
he doesn't exist?

1:00:15.967 --> 1:00:18.133
Thank you for
coming in Mr. Astori.

1:00:18.133 --> 1:00:20.067
Wasn't aware it was a request.

1:00:21.267 --> 1:00:22.900
How are you doing
today, Andrew?

1:00:25.133 --> 1:00:26.400
Or do you prefer Andy?

1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:28.933
Who's Andrew?

1:00:33.233 --> 1:00:34.767
South Milan, was it?

1:00:37.700 --> 1:00:42.667
According to your P60 Lynn
Franco Astori is 24 years old.

1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:48.567
Whereas you, Andrew Stafford,
were born June 5th, 1969.

1:00:48.567 --> 1:00:49.600
Bloody hell.

1:00:51.033 --> 1:00:53.033
Look, I'm lying low.

1:00:53.033 --> 1:00:54.633
That's all.

1:00:54.633 --> 1:00:56.800
Got myself into a
bit of a pickle.

1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:58.567
What kind of a pickle?

1:00:58.567 --> 1:01:01.167
The kind that comes with
extortion at interest.

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.833
You're working
under a false identity

1:01:04.833 --> 1:01:06.300
to hide from debt collectors?

1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:07.533
It's a real identity.

1:01:07.533 --> 1:01:09.933
Lynn Franco's this lad
I know in Coventry.

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:11.167
It's all above board.

1:01:11.167 --> 1:01:13.267
I've got an email from
him saying I can use it.

1:01:17.133 --> 1:01:19.467
And Robin found
out about this?

1:01:21.733 --> 1:01:23.433
So she terminates
your employment.

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:26.067
And then last Friday after work,

1:01:26.067 --> 1:01:27.333
you pop over to Robin's house.

1:01:27.333 --> 1:01:28.900
Have a quick chat about it.

1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:30.200
No.

1:01:30.200 --> 1:01:32.633
After I finished work, I
went to my girlfriend's.

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:38.833
Look, okay.

1:01:38.833 --> 1:01:42.267
Yeah, Robin found out about
it and we made a deal.

1:01:42.267 --> 1:01:43.300
I'll go quietly.

1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:44.533
She wouldn't report it.

1:01:44.533 --> 1:01:45.800
Avoid the bad publicity.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.667
After I'd done her
a favor or two.

1:01:47.667 --> 1:01:48.900
What favor?

1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:50.133
Got her that watch
back, didn't I?

1:01:51.233 --> 1:01:52.067
When was this?

1:01:53.433 --> 1:01:54.733
Last week.

1:01:54.733 --> 1:01:57.633
Nicks asked me if I'd
help her flog a watch.

1:01:59.300 --> 1:02:00.667
Like I'm that stupid.

1:02:00.667 --> 1:02:02.467
I knew Luca had nicked it.

1:02:02.467 --> 1:02:05.433
So I told him to give it back
to Robin, ungrateful cow.

1:02:06.900 --> 1:02:07.900
God rest her soul.

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:44.800
Hello Nicks, how you doing?

1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:46.500
Can I help you?

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:47.667
How's Luca?

1:02:47.667 --> 1:02:48.767
Is he in?

1:02:48.767 --> 1:02:49.600
Luca?

1:02:51.067 --> 1:02:52.267
No.

1:02:52.267 --> 1:02:53.600
Not to worry, we'll wait.

1:02:55.067 --> 1:02:56.433
There's a warrant and a
battering ram on the way.

1:02:56.433 --> 1:02:58.200
They said it'd be 10 minutes.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:02:59.800
Yeah, I better hurry them up.

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:00.900
Yeah, why not.

1:03:04.100 --> 1:03:06.567
This is a murder investigation.

1:03:06.567 --> 1:03:09.100
We found the body of
Robin Romano yesterday.

1:03:10.067 --> 1:03:11.333
He's asleep on the sofa.

1:03:11.333 --> 1:03:12.300
I'll wake him up.

1:03:14.467 --> 1:03:16.700
He was waiting when I got
home from work on Friday.

1:03:16.700 --> 1:03:17.700
What time was that?

1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:20.767
Like, quarter past 11.

1:03:20.767 --> 1:03:22.267
Why didn't you
tell us that before?

1:03:22.267 --> 1:03:24.700
Oh and get thumbed for
possession or whatever?

1:03:24.700 --> 1:03:26.733
We're gonna need the
clothes he was wearing.

1:03:54.067 --> 1:03:57.067
We believe Robin Romano
was attacked at her home

1:03:57.067 --> 1:03:58.133
on Friday night.

1:04:01.333 --> 1:04:03.167
At the bottom of the garden

1:04:03.167 --> 1:04:05.833
we found footprints
from a pair of shoes

1:04:05.833 --> 1:04:07.367
identical to yours.

1:04:10.067 --> 1:04:11.067
Were you there?

1:04:17.167 --> 1:04:20.200
We found this in Robin's car.

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.300
Is this yours?

1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:23.533
No.

1:04:38.533 --> 1:04:41.167
Quite a collection of
Adidas in your wardrobe.

1:04:44.233 --> 1:04:48.067
Whenever I fall out with
mom, Robin takes me shopping.

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:52.333
Her way of keeping the peace.

1:04:54.133 --> 1:04:56.133
Emotional bribery.

1:04:59.100 --> 1:05:00.533
That's a lot of shoes.

1:05:01.667 --> 1:05:02.867
A lot of falling out.

1:05:05.367 --> 1:05:06.367
Over what?

1:05:07.367 --> 1:05:10.200
Money, restaurant,

1:05:11.467 --> 1:05:12.300
my father.

1:05:14.833 --> 1:05:15.800
You know about him?

1:05:18.367 --> 1:05:20.100
She promised when I turned 21,

1:05:21.067 --> 1:05:22.567
she'd tell me where he was.

1:05:24.167 --> 1:05:26.100
Robin was helping
me look for him.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:32.533
Did she suffer?

1:05:38.533 --> 1:05:41.100
You were at the
house on Friday night.

1:05:44.067 --> 1:05:46.300
Why were you there, seeing
what you could nick?

1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:47.633
I didn't even see Robin.

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:51.300
I let myself in the back,

1:05:51.300 --> 1:05:52.633
but she came home early.

1:05:52.633 --> 1:05:54.067
So I jumped over
the garden wall.

1:05:54.067 --> 1:05:55.633
I licked it straight to Nicks.

1:05:55.633 --> 1:05:57.300
What time was that?

1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:58.200
Quarter to 10.

1:05:59.833 --> 1:06:02.067
There's cameras everywhere
if you don't believe me.

1:06:03.733 --> 1:06:04.967
We're checking.

1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:11.067
What do you think
happened to Robin?

1:06:26.133 --> 1:06:27.667
Soles from his trainers
match the footprints

1:06:27.667 --> 1:06:28.667
from the garden,

1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:32.067
but there's no blood
on his clothes.

1:06:32.067 --> 1:06:32.900
He didn't do it.

1:06:34.933 --> 1:06:37.500
Jess did some more
digging into the financials

1:06:37.500 --> 1:06:39.067
and found this.

1:06:41.067 --> 1:06:42.900
I've called Ms.
Dalton in for a chat.

1:06:49.967 --> 1:06:52.300
Thank you for coming
in, Mrs. Dalton.

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:53.800
What's this about?

1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:54.867
Please have a seat.

1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:06.967
You should take this.

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.100
It's regarding
the 300,000 pounds

1:07:13.100 --> 1:07:16.733
that was deposited into your
wife's account six months ago.

1:07:25.567 --> 1:07:27.133
Multiple transactions,

1:07:27.133 --> 1:07:29.533
which we believe Robin
tried to disguise

1:07:29.533 --> 1:07:32.067
using a variety of
online payment methods.

1:07:32.067 --> 1:07:36.367
In total, over four months,
Robin spent 294,567 pounds.

1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:41.233
We've requested details
on those transactions,

1:07:41.233 --> 1:07:43.300
but we're hoping you
can speed things up.

1:07:45.133 --> 1:07:47.500
I'm sorry, it's the
first I've heard of this.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:51.067
The 300,000 pounds was
from this re-mortgage loan.

1:07:53.933 --> 1:07:55.567
In your joint names?

1:07:59.133 --> 1:08:00.600
I never seen this before.

1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:03.267
How do you explain
this, Mrs. Dalton?

1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:17.567
That is your signature.

1:08:24.433 --> 1:08:25.567
I didn't sign this.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:27.300
Julia--

1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:28.133
I didn't!

1:08:29.467 --> 1:08:31.100
Robin asked me to sign it.

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.333
I didn't even look at it though.

1:08:33.333 --> 1:08:35.267
You had no idea what it was?

1:08:35.267 --> 1:08:36.633
Robin turned up for work

1:08:36.633 --> 1:08:38.833
and said, "Will you
sign something for me?"

1:08:38.833 --> 1:08:39.667
And so I did.

1:08:41.067 --> 1:08:42.367
Did Julia know about it?

1:08:43.967 --> 1:08:45.567
No, no.

1:08:46.467 --> 1:08:48.200
She asked me not to tell her.

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:52.533
Did Robin tell you she'd
forged your signature?

1:08:54.133 --> 1:08:56.733
That explains why you're
selling the business.

1:08:56.733 --> 1:08:57.833
To pay off this debt.

1:08:59.900 --> 1:09:01.467
These trips to
Hammersmith began

1:09:01.467 --> 1:09:03.733
the same time as
these transactions.

1:09:04.833 --> 1:09:06.633
Can you shed some light on this?

1:09:09.467 --> 1:09:10.300
Beth?

1:09:13.067 --> 1:09:13.867
No.

1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.500
Is it possible that Robin was
in a relationship with Beth?

1:09:25.733 --> 1:09:26.567
What?

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:29.100
No, no of course not!

1:09:45.267 --> 1:09:46.100
Hi, this is Beth.

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:48.133
Please leave a message.

1:09:48.133 --> 1:09:50.700
Beth, what the hell were
you and my wife up to?

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:53.133
Whatever it was,
I deserve to know.

1:09:53.133 --> 1:09:53.967
Call me.

1:10:37.967 --> 1:10:39.233
Remember when the
book first came out

1:10:39.233 --> 1:10:40.933
it hardly sold?

1:10:40.933 --> 1:10:43.433
And you were upset because
you thought it had flopped

1:10:48.467 --> 1:10:52.033
Then Robin suggested
that we buy a few copies

1:10:52.033 --> 1:10:53.133
to get a pulse going.

1:10:55.300 --> 1:10:57.067
Every few weeks she'd buy more.

1:10:58.067 --> 1:10:59.533
And then she'd drive a van load

1:10:59.533 --> 1:11:03.433
to a book recycling
place in Hammersmith.

1:11:03.433 --> 1:11:06.067
Robin bought--

1:11:06.067 --> 1:11:06.933
The best seller.

1:11:06.933 --> 1:11:08.200
She was going to tell you.

1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:09.733
Once you'd sold the restaurant

1:11:09.733 --> 1:11:11.100
she was going to come clean

1:11:12.533 --> 1:11:15.800
and ask you pay off the
300 grand from the profit.

1:11:18.133 --> 1:11:20.800
It worked, the plan worked.

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:23.100
And Julia, she did it for you.

1:11:23.100 --> 1:11:24.400
This is all for you.

1:11:28.633 --> 1:11:32.533
CCTV from the World Zen
confirms Luca's alibi.

1:11:32.533 --> 1:11:35.133
Beth and Johno were at the
restaurant until midnight.

1:11:35.133 --> 1:11:36.967
Lynn Franco?

1:11:36.967 --> 1:11:39.267
A, his girlfriend
confirmed that he was at hers

1:11:39.267 --> 1:11:40.800
from just after 11,

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.800
and B he's too stupid.

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:46.133
And Julia was
talking to our officers

1:11:46.133 --> 1:11:48.267
whilst Robin's body
was being dumped.

1:11:49.167 --> 1:11:50.633
Don't mind us.

1:11:51.733 --> 1:11:53.433
Sorry, new trainers
are pinching.

1:12:06.833 --> 1:12:07.900
Max?

1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:09.400
Whenever Luca got upset

1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:11.133
Robin would take
in shoe shopping,

1:12:11.133 --> 1:12:13.100
her way of keeping the peace.

1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:15.067
Those, the boot shoes,

1:12:15.067 --> 1:12:16.633
the ones with the red soles.

1:12:16.633 --> 1:12:17.667
Christian Louboutin.

1:12:17.667 --> 1:12:19.067
Are they expensive?

1:12:19.067 --> 1:12:20.733
Hideously.

1:12:20.733 --> 1:12:23.200
So a junior chef
wearing a pair?

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:31.233
You own a pair of
Christian Louboutin trainers.

1:12:31.233 --> 1:12:32.933
I own a lot of trainers.

1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:35.933
Did Robin buy them for you?

1:12:36.900 --> 1:12:37.733
No.

1:12:40.167 --> 1:12:44.367
According to Robin Romano's
credit card statement

1:12:44.367 --> 1:12:45.967
three days before she died

1:12:45.967 --> 1:12:48.433
she bought a pair of those
trainers from Harrods.

1:12:50.067 --> 1:12:52.067
They were size seven,

1:12:52.067 --> 1:12:53.933
gift wrapped too.

1:12:53.933 --> 1:12:55.367
What size are you, Nicks?

1:12:56.633 --> 1:12:59.067
I didn't want anything
to do with this.

1:13:04.767 --> 1:13:06.867
Last week I came in early

1:13:06.867 --> 1:13:10.067
and I walked in on
Robin and Johno arguing.

1:13:10.067 --> 1:13:11.667
Like top of their lungs.

1:13:11.667 --> 1:13:13.167
Johno was furious.

1:13:13.167 --> 1:13:15.067
He was asking Robin when the
royalties were coming in,

1:13:15.067 --> 1:13:16.700
said he was sick of waiting.

1:13:19.333 --> 1:13:20.867
And she bought me the trainers

1:13:20.867 --> 1:13:22.567
so I wouldn't
mention it to Julia.

1:13:25.067 --> 1:13:28.700
What, are you going
to impound them?

1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:29.700
No.

1:13:29.700 --> 1:13:30.767
You can keep them.

1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:01.700
They're the same recipes.

1:14:04.233 --> 1:14:07.067
They reused them
in the new book.

1:14:10.167 --> 1:14:12.633
Johno's recipes.

1:14:12.633 --> 1:14:13.767
But according to Beth,

1:14:13.767 --> 1:14:15.900
he was at the restaurant
until midnight.

1:14:17.367 --> 1:14:19.667
At least that's
what Beth told us.

1:14:30.067 --> 1:14:31.467
Caio food lovers.

1:14:31.467 --> 1:14:33.700
Mrs. Romano here from
the beating heart

1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:35.233
of Romano's Restaurant.

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:39.833
This is our head
chef, Cousin Johno.

1:14:39.833 --> 1:14:42.067
And here comes
the beautiful Beth.

1:14:42.067 --> 1:14:42.900
Hi.

1:14:49.767 --> 1:14:51.100
Johno and Beth?

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:58.600
About midnight Johno
locked up after me.

1:14:59.467 --> 1:15:00.967
We think you're lying.

1:15:03.767 --> 1:15:06.700
Has Johno talked about
what happened that night?

1:15:06.700 --> 1:15:07.867
No.

1:15:07.867 --> 1:15:09.700
Have you
asked him about Robin?

1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:11.200
Why would I?

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:12.400
I take it your husband

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:13.700
doesn't know about
you and Johno?

1:15:24.133 --> 1:15:25.600
Recognize this?

1:15:26.733 --> 1:15:28.200
We found it in Robin's car.

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:32.333
Oh God.

1:15:34.700 --> 1:15:36.067
Is it yours?

1:15:38.200 --> 1:15:40.467
It was a gift for Johno.

1:15:45.067 --> 1:15:46.433
I gave it to him the day...

1:15:49.900 --> 1:15:51.267
The day that Robin died.

1:16:02.067 --> 1:16:03.533
Got it.

1:16:03.533 --> 1:16:06.533
Connor says his phone just
pinged the mast in Oxbridge.

1:16:06.533 --> 1:16:08.167
Alert all units.

1:16:08.167 --> 1:16:10.800
Suspect Johno Romano
wanted in connection

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:12.933
with the murder of Robin Romano,

1:16:12.933 --> 1:16:15.133
driving a blue Honda CRV,

1:16:15.133 --> 1:16:19.400
Sierra Yankee zero five
Foxtrot Foxtrot Tango.

1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:21.833
Received.

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.267
Over there.

1:16:42.733 --> 1:16:43.667
No sign of him.

1:16:46.067 --> 1:16:46.900
I'll call it in.

1:16:48.933 --> 1:16:50.133
He's at the lake.

1:17:03.233 --> 1:17:04.067
There he is.

1:17:06.133 --> 1:17:08.267
I'm going to talk to him.

1:17:08.267 --> 1:17:09.100
Max, Max!

1:17:25.867 --> 1:17:26.700
All right.

1:17:28.933 --> 1:17:29.900
Mind if I join you?

1:17:47.767 --> 1:17:50.767
Good of Beth to
give you an alibi.

1:17:50.767 --> 1:17:52.300
We didn't pick up on that.

1:17:52.300 --> 1:17:53.100
You and her.

1:17:55.433 --> 1:17:57.667
She didn't want to believe
you had anything to do

1:17:57.667 --> 1:17:59.067
with what happened to Robin.

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:04.600
Backup's on its way.

1:18:10.233 --> 1:18:12.267
We found the
necklace Beth gave you.

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:17.200
That's what you were looking
for in Julia's house.

1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.233
Why you sent that
email to get her out.

1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:23.633
You must have been desperate.

1:18:28.267 --> 1:18:30.100
You didn't drop it in the house.

1:18:31.067 --> 1:18:32.633
It was in Robin's car.

1:18:45.333 --> 1:18:47.967
We were going to run
the restaurant together,

1:18:47.967 --> 1:18:48.800
me and Beth.

1:18:50.467 --> 1:18:51.867
She was leaving her husband.

1:18:53.267 --> 1:18:55.300
As soon as my
royalties came through

1:18:55.300 --> 1:18:56.733
I was going to make my pitch.

1:18:57.867 --> 1:18:59.867
Luca couldn't care
less about the place.

1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:02.567
I was next in line.

1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:08.633
40 odd thousand copies
sold, 20 quid apart.

1:19:08.633 --> 1:19:10.667
That's 800,000.

1:19:12.433 --> 1:19:15.067
How much were you due to
earn from the royalties?

1:19:15.067 --> 1:19:16.233
50, 50 grand.

1:19:19.233 --> 1:19:21.067
Robin forgot she'd
ever promised it.

1:19:22.567 --> 1:19:24.400
She stood there in that house

1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:25.600
said there was no money.

1:19:27.133 --> 1:19:28.600
Told me I'd have to wait.

1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:31.300
She'd pay me when the sale
of the business went through.

1:19:36.067 --> 1:19:37.633
You were never on their radar.

1:19:39.533 --> 1:19:42.633
I'm a Romano, I'm family.

1:19:42.633 --> 1:19:44.433
You never even asked me.

1:19:49.733 --> 1:19:52.433
I saw them talking about blokes.

1:19:52.433 --> 1:19:54.767
I went round after work
to ask Robin about it.

1:19:57.933 --> 1:20:00.467
She thought I was worried
about losing my job,

1:20:00.467 --> 1:20:01.933
told me not to worry.

1:20:01.933 --> 1:20:04.300
I could carry on working in the
kitchen under the new owner.

1:20:08.433 --> 1:20:11.500
I told her my plans,
my ideas, and...

1:20:19.133 --> 1:20:20.167
she laughed.

1:20:21.667 --> 1:20:22.700
She laughed at me.

1:20:30.033 --> 1:20:31.167
So what did you do?

1:20:34.167 --> 1:20:36.000
Picked something up.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:38.500
Didn't even know what
it was, and I swung.

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.800
Missed, smashed a window.

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:41.600
Then I...

1:20:46.533 --> 1:20:51.500
I hit her.

1:20:57.133 --> 1:20:58.533
I tried to save her.

1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.467
I was taking her
to the hospital but

1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:03.833
it was too late.

1:21:08.967 --> 1:21:10.300
It was too late.

1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:17.900
So instead you
brought her here.

1:21:24.467 --> 1:21:26.367
We're dredging this tomorrow.

1:21:29.733 --> 1:21:31.567
Will we find that hammer?

1:21:36.467 --> 1:21:37.300
Johno.

1:21:46.333 --> 1:21:47.533
Oh God, I'm sorry!

1:21:47.533 --> 1:21:49.400
It's okay, it's okay.

1:22:20.367 --> 1:22:21.200
Good job.

1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:22.067
Thanks.

1:22:27.067 --> 1:22:27.967
Brilliant, thanks.

1:22:27.967 --> 1:22:28.800
You're welcome.

1:22:30.067 --> 1:22:31.833
Hey, I'm okay.

1:22:31.833 --> 1:22:33.500
He's a chef, Max.

1:22:33.500 --> 1:22:35.067
Of course he's got
a bloody knife.

1:22:35.067 --> 1:22:37.067
Well I know that now.

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:43.067
I suppose I could
still clap one handed.

1:22:43.067 --> 1:22:44.567
It is tonight, right?

1:22:44.567 --> 1:22:47.200
Your veterans race?

1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:51.433
That's all right,
you're off the hook.

1:22:51.433 --> 1:22:53.167
Ah, thanks.

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:55.667
I really didn't want to go.

1:22:57.967 --> 1:22:58.800
Right.

1:23:11.267 --> 1:23:12.800
Luca.

1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:13.633
Mom.

1:23:18.067 --> 1:23:18.833
I've...

1:23:23.067 --> 1:23:23.833
Have you eaten?

1:23:27.067 --> 1:23:29.400
I thought I could just
rustle us up something

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:31.333
to eat,

1:23:33.233 --> 1:23:34.233
if you like.

1:23:44.200 --> 1:23:45.967
Yes, I'd like that.

1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:57.300
Hey, you're
going to be late.

1:23:57.300 --> 1:23:58.833
What time's your competition?

1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:02.067
I thought we'd have
a date night instead.

1:24:02.900 --> 1:24:03.733
Yeah.

1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:05.800
Chinese.

1:24:20.233 --> 1:24:21.167
Love you.

1:24:23.767 --> 1:24:24.600
I know.

1:24:45.500 --> 1:24:47.233
What happened to your hand?

1:24:49.633 --> 1:24:50.867
Occupational hazard.

1:24:52.367 --> 1:24:53.200
What do you want?

1:25:01.133 --> 1:25:03.300
I'll give you a fair
price for the books.

1:25:07.067 --> 1:25:08.400
Is your phone broken?

1:25:09.267 --> 1:25:10.567
You couldn't text me this?

1:25:11.833 --> 1:25:12.733
I was passing.

1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:16.633
You weren't passing.

1:25:16.633 --> 1:25:18.267
I was.

1:25:18.267 --> 1:25:20.100
In your boyfriends Porsche?

1:25:24.867 --> 1:25:28.767
For the record, Patrick
and I are not dating.

1:25:30.067 --> 1:25:31.600
He was interested in my gallery.

1:25:32.833 --> 1:25:34.367
I told him it was not for sale.

1:25:36.067 --> 1:25:38.267
We used to laugh at
rich pricks like him,

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:42.933
in expensive shoes and
thousand pound suits.

1:25:44.867 --> 1:25:48.100
Not everyone's thinks is a
crime to buy nice things, Max.

1:25:51.933 --> 1:25:54.433
Take away his money, his
good looks, and his charm.

1:25:54.433 --> 1:25:55.733
What are you left with?

1:25:57.067 --> 1:25:57.833
You.
