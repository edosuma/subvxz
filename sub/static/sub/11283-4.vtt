00:07.708 --> 00:09.775
(panting)

00:23.391 --> 00:25.391
What's going on, Carlton?

00:25.393 --> 00:27.359
(panting):
Nothing, Rowena.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.494
Why are you awake?

00:28.496 --> 00:31.263
Uh... I got up
and you weren't here.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.265
(tires screeching)
Come on, Row,
it's a school night.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.700
(hip-hop playing)

00:34.702 --> 00:35.768
(tires screech)

00:39.473 --> 00:42.408
Quickly, hide now!

00:43.377 --> 00:44.643
(yells)

00:44.645 --> 00:47.079
Come on, Carlton,
you're coming with us.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.113
Come on,
come on, grab him.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.382
Get off me.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.285
(strained grunting)

00:53.287 --> 00:55.087
No, no!

00:55.089 --> 00:56.288
No, get off me!

00:56.290 --> 00:58.223
ATTACKER:
Get in the car.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.391
Cory, let's go.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.659
Drive.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.530
(tires screeching)

01:10.237 --> 01:12.204
Go.
Come on, Sam,
come on, Sam.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.273
Oh, yeah.
WORDY: You got him, Jules.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.474
Let's go-- speed,

01:15.476 --> 01:16.842
speed, speed.
You got her,
you got her.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.377
Go through it,
go through it.
Come on, Sam.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.578
Come on, Sam.
You're lagging.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.246
Speed, speed,
speed, let's go.
Go, go, go.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.315
Yes, yes.
Go, go!

01:23.317 --> 01:25.250
Yeah, $20.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.251
Not ten-- 20.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.720
WORDY:
All right, all right.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.188
That's a whole
lot of lunch.
All right,
I got it.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.689
Go again?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.758
How about you buy me
a beer instead?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.593
Can't. I might have a date.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.328
(chuckles):
Date?

01:36.330 --> 01:38.330
With your, uh, paramedic?

01:38.332 --> 01:39.331
Maybe.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.599
It's kind of a maybe date.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.301
As in maybe you'll go?

01:42.303 --> 01:44.236
Or maybe we're
just catching up.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.472
You know, it's Steve--
we're old friends.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.273
I don't even know
if it's a date.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.608
Right.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.810
PARKER:
All right, results.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.680
Sam and Jules head-to-head
on the night shooting course.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.115
Double or nothing?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.549
Get the money out.
You get the money out.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.550
Jules' time:

01:58.552 --> 01:59.551
one minute, 17 seconds.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.587
A personal best.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.622
PARKER: Time, Sam: one
minute, 13.5 seconds--

02:03.624 --> 02:05.257
a course record.
Not so fast, Spike.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.126
ED:
Accuracy--

02:07.128 --> 02:09.361
Jules: 100%.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.395
Accuracy-- Sam...

02:10.397 --> 02:11.697
That's more
like a shotgun.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.165
What's up
with that?

02:13.167 --> 02:14.166
SPIKE:
So who won?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.367
PARKER:
Fast and accurate,

02:15.369 --> 02:16.802
(alarm wailing)
we all do, Spike.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.303
Team One, hot call. Hot call.
Come on.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.372
PARKER:
Now we're hot.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.244
(sirens wailing)

02:38.359 --> 02:41.293
PARKER:
All right, we got a
kidnapping victim--

02:41.295 --> 02:43.529
one Carlton Hayward, 16.

02:43.531 --> 02:44.796
No priors.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.565
Three masked subjects,
forced entry.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.500
PARKER:
And no ransom demand yet.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.469
This neighborhood reads gangs.
Could be drug related.

02:50.471 --> 02:53.372
Retaliation snatch,
insurance on a debt?

02:53.374 --> 02:54.573
PARKER:
Well, let's find out.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.408
His seven-year-old sister
witnessed it.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.409
Jules, let's go.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.178
Yep.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.312
Okay, let's wake up the block.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.914
Spike.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.348
SPIKE (over headset):
Profiling our kid.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.917
On it.
(typing)

03:04.919 --> 03:07.352
Carlton's got nothing
to do with gangs.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.354
He's a sweet boy,
he's an athlete.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.323
He plays senior basketball
at Eastern Tech.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.592
Eastern Tech Warriors--
good team, city champs.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.027
To be from this neighborhood

03:15.028 --> 03:16.461
and to get
into that basketball program--

03:16.463 --> 03:17.963
it's a... it's a lot
of sacrifices.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.431
Do you think
there could be

03:19.433 --> 03:21.466
some gang trouble that
you don't know about--

03:21.468 --> 03:25.470
friends involved, you know,
a beef of some kind, girls?

03:25.472 --> 03:26.705
I don't think so.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.540
I mean, we talk, you know?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.608
I work night shift.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.776
I have to trust him.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.611
Basketball is
everything to Carlton,

03:32.613 --> 03:33.979
24-7.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.414
Our whole focus
is a college scholarship.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.683
We're going to need a
list of his friends,

03:37.685 --> 03:39.484
if that's all right.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.854
Well, I can confirm the surface.

03:42.855 --> 03:44.855
Carlton Hayward was City Rookie
of the Year in grade eight.

03:44.858 --> 03:45.924
Caught a few scouts' eyes,

03:45.926 --> 03:46.858
became the Warriors'
point guard,

03:46.860 --> 03:48.460
kept it up as a sophomore.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.662
Whoa-ho-ho, kid's a playmaker.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.863
PARKER:
What do gangs want

03:51.865 --> 03:54.833
with a straight-living kid
like this?

03:54.835 --> 03:57.436
CARLTON:
No, come on.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.837
Come on.
Get off, get off.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.372
(strained grunting)

04:00.374 --> 04:01.740
Get him down.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.842
Hold still.
No, no.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.744
(strained grunting)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.446
You don't have to do this.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.281
You don't have
to do this.
Shut up.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.849
Cory, Cory...
Shut up, man.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.851
Cory, don't, don't.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.319
Come on.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.456
Hit him.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.458
Boss.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.692
Boss,
a neighbor says

04:20.694 --> 04:22.761
there's a local
who goes by the name K.V.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.429
who drives
a tricked-out red import.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.664
SPIKE:
K.V.-- nice.

04:25.666 --> 04:28.117
K.V. has a record.

04:28.118 --> 04:30.569
It I.D.s Kevin Pearce--
19, black, gang affiliate.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.870
PARKER:
Copy that.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.872
Pearce.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.409
This Cory Pearce-- is he
related to a K.V. or a Kevin?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.644
Yes, that's his brother.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.013
Cory is Carlton's best friend
on the team.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.715
He's an Eastern Tech
outsider, too,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.350
meaning, you know,
they don't come from money.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.719
Are they having a
problem, a falling out?
No.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.855
No, those two have
each other's backs over there.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.724
Cory would never do anything
like this to Carlton.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.859
CARLTON:
<i> Cory.</i>

04:53.861 --> 04:54.826
Cory, don't.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.762
Cory.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.764
Cory.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.465
Do it, do it.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.401
Get off me, man.
Come on,
you started this.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.303
I can't do this.
Hit him.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.737
You're the only one
who can finish it.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.973
Hit him.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.508
Guys, we have
an address for K.V.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.742
It's right around the corner.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.578
Apartment 906, 2225 Parliament.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.448
Okay. Sam, Wordy,
you're with me, let's go.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.786
(siren wailing)

05:23.791 --> 05:25.791
Wordy, keep an eye
on the back door.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.893
WORDY:
Copy.

05:27.895 --> 05:28.827
Police, SRU!

05:28.829 --> 05:29.828
(clattering)

05:29.830 --> 05:31.930
I hear movement.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.598
Police, right there!
Police, don't move!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.767
No other option here,
Kevin, do what he says.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.936
Put your hands
on your head.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.971
Where's Carlton Hayward?

05:39.973 --> 05:42.007
Are you deaf?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.642
Man, what up?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.510
You know who I'm talking about.
No,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.079
I don't know nobody.
Hands up.

05:47.081 --> 05:48.714
Where's your car?

05:48.716 --> 05:51.016
Apartment's clear.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.985
Man, I don't have to
tell you anything.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.456
Boss, no car,

05:57.458 --> 05:58.490
no Carlton at this location.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.925
Copy that.
Stand by.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.827
What do we got
on the younger brother?

06:01.829 --> 06:02.828
Cory Pearce?

06:02.830 --> 06:03.895
(typing)
Sending out a photo.

06:03.897 --> 06:04.896
Priors?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.131
Brushes, petty stuff.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.999
Looks like he's one
foot in, one foot out.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.035
Where's your brother?
Where's my lawyer?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.453
Does Cory have your car?

06:11.454 --> 06:12.870
Man, you can fish all you want,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.539
I ain't gonna bite.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.974
SPIKE:
Guys, we got an anonymous

06:15.976 --> 06:18.009
911 call just coming
in-- assault in progress

06:18.011 --> 06:19.911
at Eastern Tech.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.446
PARKER:
Eddie, you're closest.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.481
No lights, no sirens.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.083
You should call a lawyer.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.556
(strained grunting)

06:31.558 --> 06:32.624
CARLTON:
Get off of me!

06:32.626 --> 06:33.625
Stop it!
Do it, man.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.626
You're my friend.
Do it.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.827
You're my friend.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.828
I'm sorry.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.630
Why are you...?

06:38.632 --> 06:39.898
(groans)

06:39.900 --> 06:40.899
Hit him again.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.501
(grunting)
Come on, harder.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.769
CARLTON:
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Carlton.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.770
Stop it.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.771
Harder,
Cory, do it.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.606
Stop, stop it!

06:47.608 --> 06:48.607
Hit him again.
Harder.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.575
Come on.
(grunts)

06:50.577 --> 06:51.576
Stop it.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.979
(grunting)

06:59.920 --> 07:03.855
(tires screeching)

07:04.992 --> 07:06.992
Boss, we're on the ground,

07:06.994 --> 07:08.026
sweeping
from the east perimeter.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.528
Sam,

07:09.530 --> 07:11.530
take the north alley,
I'll meet you in back.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.597
Copy.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.168
(grunting)

07:16.170 --> 07:17.436
Come on.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.806
(grunting)
Sam, school yard.

07:20.808 --> 07:21.807
Hey! Police!

07:21.809 --> 07:22.874
SRU!

07:23.944 --> 07:26.077
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.146
Police! Hold it right
there!
Don't move!
I said don't move!

07:28.148 --> 07:30.081
Hey!
SRU!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.416
Right there!
Stay where you are!

07:31.417 --> 07:32.750
ED: We'll be right
back for you, son.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.952
Hey!
Stop right there!

07:33.954 --> 07:36.721
Hey!

07:36.723 --> 07:38.790
Stop right there!

07:38.792 --> 07:39.991
Down on the ground!

07:39.993 --> 07:41.927
(both grunting)

07:41.929 --> 07:44.930
Stop now!
On the ground!

07:46.233 --> 07:47.632
SRU!

07:47.634 --> 07:49.134
Stop, damn it!

07:59.112 --> 08:01.646
He's gone.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.717
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:35.916 --> 08:38.817
SAM:
Stop now! On the ground!

08:42.289 --> 08:44.289
He's gone.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.924
PARKER:
Carlton has disappeared?

08:45.926 --> 08:46.958
That doesn't add up.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.793
Carlton's the one
being attacked.

08:48.795 --> 08:49.794
Yeah, why would he take off?

08:49.796 --> 08:50.896
The cops are here-- he's safe.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.531
Who we got?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.165
This is Antony Romero.
Judson Wells.

08:55.269 --> 08:56.268
What about Cory?

08:56.270 --> 08:57.636
SAM:
He took off.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.870
ED:
What the hell are these?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.105
Oranges.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.706
Not supposed
to leave bruises,

09:01.708 --> 09:02.941
a way to hide
visible injuries.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.010
Boss, are you copying this?
Yeah, Ed.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.178
Does it sound like a jumping in
to you, a gang initiation?

09:07.180 --> 09:08.179
Cory's brother's affiliated.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.648
Maybe they want Carlton in, too.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.016
That explains why he'd run.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.284
But not the masks.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.920
You jump in face-to-face--
that's the point.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.022
I mean, look where they brought
him-- a basketball court.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.857
SPIKE:
You're on the
right track, boss.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.993
These guys are on the same
roster as Carlton and Cory.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.762
So they didn't want anyone
to know that they were

09:23.764 --> 09:24.896
beating up on
a teammate,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.965
or they didn't want
to hurt him so bad

09:26.967 --> 09:28.133
that he couldn't play.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.901
So, what, a hazing?

09:29.903 --> 09:30.902
Carlton's not a rookie.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.737
We got a witness--
spotted Cory

09:32.739 --> 09:34.606
getting into a black coupe
going West on Harbord.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
Car was stolen
out of a driveway

09:36.043 --> 09:37.826
this morning
in Forest Hill.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.610
Who wants to bet
it's his car thief brother?

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
PARKER:
Okay, listen up, people,

09:41.014 --> 09:42.914
we've got a kidnapping victim
that is still missing.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.015
He's snatched

09:44.017 --> 09:44.883
and he's beaten
by his own teammates.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.585
I want to know why.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.686
Did he tank a game?

09:47.688 --> 09:48.820
Did he steal
someone's girlfriend?

09:48.822 --> 09:49.854
Spike, I see security cameras

09:49.856 --> 09:51.189
on the school exterior.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.190
Are we hot here?

09:52.192 --> 09:53.825
SPIKE:
I'll find out ASAP

09:53.827 --> 09:56.027
and I'll get Sidney to trace
that anonymous 911 call.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.763
We got a witness
out there somewhere.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.831
Okay, let's separate them.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.900
Looks like we're going
to school.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.139
(horns honking)

10:09.910 --> 10:12.043
PARKER:
A crime scene
on the property,

10:12.045 --> 10:13.778
and the bell rings
in 40 minutes.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.981
I'm afraid it's going
to be a busy day.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.983
We've got nearly
2,000 students.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.250
Busy is what we do.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.620
What can you tell
me about these boys?

10:21.622 --> 10:24.322
Well, I can't know everybody,
but I do know these two.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.091
They banded together
like brothers.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.227
Most of our students
are upper, upper-middle class,

10:29.229 --> 10:30.795
but they're not.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.097
They worked their way here.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.632
Carlton's a good kid.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.000
He's a natural athlete,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.701
Humble, kind.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.970
Cory's a little harder
to pin down.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.905
A young man
of few words.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.808
Carlton's grades have
dropped a bit lately.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.310
Well, it's mid-season.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.113
Basketball takes
a tremendous amount of time.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.914
If Cory and Carlton
are so close,

10:49.916 --> 10:51.916
any idea
why Cory would assault him?

10:51.918 --> 10:53.918
That's a bit out of my sphere.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.186
Anything basketball
is Coach Wellstead.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.821
He should be here
any minute.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.823
ED:
Coach Wellstead?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.158
Ed Lane, SRU.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.761
Listen, can you shed
some light on this for us?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.763
I'm baffled.
Carlton's a popular kid.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.898
What did Jud and Antony have
to say for themselves?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.333
Haven't talked
to them yet, sir.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.934
You know, they
respect Carlton.

11:09.936 --> 11:11.686
I don't get it.

11:11.687 --> 11:13.437
Any friction between these two,
on court, off court?

11:13.440 --> 11:14.806
No, nothing abnormal.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.808
What do you mean, abnormal?

11:16.809 --> 11:18.809
I mean, they're rangy teenage
kids playing high level ball.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.628
There's always
a certain level of friction.

11:19.629 --> 11:20.445
Jostling, jealousies.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.280
Scholarships and egos
are on the line.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.049
And with a little more backbone,

11:24.051 --> 11:26.818
Carlton could be
team captain next year.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.820
Competing for recognition--
that's a lot of pressure.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.021
How is he handling that?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.189
That's a good point.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.224
His play has tapered
off a bit lately.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.027
Minutes are down, and he
has made some key mistakes.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.328
Let me ask you this.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.297
You think that's a reason
why his teammates

11:39.299 --> 11:40.432
would abduct
and assault him?

11:40.434 --> 11:41.866
(sighs)

11:41.868 --> 11:43.368
Look, I've been here 22 years.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.336
It's a new one on me.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.372
But Cory and Carlton

11:47.374 --> 11:48.807
come from the streets.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.241
Sometimes the gang stuff mixes

11:50.243 --> 11:52.210
with basketball
in dangerous ways.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.313
Antony takes
fine arts electives.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.481
Good grades,
extracurriculars.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.982
So Judson's
a hard-ass.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.285
He's a senior, he's been
on the team the longest.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.120
How do you
want to do this?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.389
People, we got anything else
on our runners Cory and Carlton?

12:04.391 --> 12:06.157
WORDY:
Yeah, uniforms out
looking for them,

12:06.159 --> 12:07.358
watching both their homes.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.893
Guys, I got surveillance cameras

12:08.895 --> 12:10.762
with partial view of the court.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.298
It's kind of tough
to make out the individuals,

12:13.300 --> 12:14.966
but I can definitely do
a conflict analysis.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.201
PARKER:
Copy.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.437
(typing)

12:21.408 --> 12:23.241
Cory, don't. Don't.
Get him down.
Get him down.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.376
Cory. Cory.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.415
Boss, I've got something.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.450
Can you upload it?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.319
Stand by.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.422
Okay, first impressions.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.257
Verbal abuse escalates
to physical violence.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.259
I don't know.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.427
Intimidation, revenge maybe?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.129
Boss, that looks
like a hazing.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.164
Believe me, those
can get out of hand.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.899
I know it did
in the military.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.534
You know, it doesn't
make any sense.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.970
It's, you know, mid-season,
he's not a rook.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.139
Why haze?
It's team culture, Jules.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.274
It's self-regulating,
it's even cruel.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.076
You know, there are disciplines
to enforce,

12:58.078 --> 12:59.310
infractions to punish.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.913
Hey, can we get this cleaned up
enough to, uh,

13:01.915 --> 13:03.348
I.D. individuals?

13:03.350 --> 13:04.349
Stand by.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.850
I'll enhance it, and

13:05.852 --> 13:07.085
go over it frame by frame.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.488
So, who wants the hard-ass?

13:10.490 --> 13:11.856
(sighs)

13:11.858 --> 13:13.458
I'll take him.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.062
SAM:
Kidnapping, break and enter,

13:18.064 --> 13:20.298
forcible confinement,
assault, obstruction.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.333
You're just shy of 18 years old,
so there's a great chance

13:22.335 --> 13:23.868
they're bumping you
to adult court.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.203
JULES:
<i> Antony.</i>

13:25.205 --> 13:28.106
Hey! I know you didn't
instigate what happened

13:28.108 --> 13:29.874
with Carlton. Antony?

13:29.876 --> 13:31.409
SAM:
<i> You didn't know</i>

13:31.411 --> 13:33.077
kidnapping was
a federal offence?

13:33.079 --> 13:34.512
Man, I didn't kidnap anybody.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.447
Can you tell me
what that's about?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.449
I mean, seriously,
you guys all know each other.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.019
So what? It's cold out.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.453
SAM:
<i> You dragged Carlton Hayward</i>

13:42.455 --> 13:43.888
out of his house

13:43.890 --> 13:45.390
and assaulted him
at the basketball court.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.058
I want to know why.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.360
Ain't no why, okay?

13:49.362 --> 13:52.297
I got nothing to say.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.365
(chatter,
indistinct radio transmission)

13:57.337 --> 13:59.170
Eddie.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.338
Thank you.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.506
Principal McKechnie,
Officer Ed Lane.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.507
Hello.
Hi, ma'am.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.059
I was just
telling her that

14:04.060 --> 14:05.610
we got a lot of people looking
for Carlton and Cory,

14:05.612 --> 14:08.513
but we're gonna need some help
from your staff.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.282
Right. We need to single out
their friends, their teammates.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.050
That would be a big help.
We're looking for background,

14:12.052 --> 14:15.053
gossip, anything that can help
us find out where they ran to.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.972
Right.
Especially Carlton,

14:16.973 --> 14:18.890
because we have to assume that
his mental state is fragile.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.391
Boss, we got a problem.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.559
Oh, my God.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.494
That's our guy.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.905
(horns honking)

14:33.907 --> 14:35.206
PARKER:
High school basketball star,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.475
abducted and assaulted
by his own teammates.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.010
Now he's a jumper.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.378
Kid's had a
really bad night.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.546
Whatever's going on between him

14:41.548 --> 14:43.248
and his buddy Cory
put him up there.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.267
No, the beating
was a catalyst.

14:45.268 --> 14:47.285
It takes more than one incident
to drive somebody to suicide.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.319
SAM:
You said his grades
were falling, too.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.988
Right? That's
another flag.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.324
Okay, the beating
was obviously premeditated.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.659
This kind of abuse has happened
in their locker room before.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.629
So, I'm gonna go up there,
I'm gonna talk to him.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.130
Spike, subject's on a flat roof,

14:59.132 --> 15:00.632
covering what looks like
a terrace up there.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.000
Copy that. Roof access

15:02.002 --> 15:04.335
is to the north,
above his position.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.137
There's a fixed ladder
you descend to get to our guy.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.405
Full climbing
and safety gear.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.940
Thanks, Wordy.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.109
SPIKE:
Boss, Jules has got
the night janitor

15:11.111 --> 15:14.312
at the main entrance to take you
to the roof, and get this.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.181
Sidney traced our anonymous
911 call to inside the school.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.218
4:23 a.m. That's got
to have been the janitor.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.220
Okay, let's go see
the night janitor.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.655
Coming through.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.057
Okay, school is cancelled.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.525
Let's keep the perimeter tight.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.027
Let's keep the gawkers moving.

15:29.029 --> 15:31.062
And let's lock this
building down, please.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.432
What's your name?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.967
Doug.
Doug what?

15:35.969 --> 15:37.819
Doug Saunders.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.670
Why didn't you identify
yourself when you called 911?

15:39.673 --> 15:42.340
Uh, I saw a kid get beat up,
I made the call.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.508
You knew who
they were.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.209
You could have saved
us valuable time.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.711
Look, this job's
about all I got, okay?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.346
And why would your job
be affected?

15:48.348 --> 15:50.348
Well, maybe it
wouldn't. I don't know.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.217
But you don't interfere with
basketball at this school.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.619
PARKER:
All right.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.288
Take my friend down to
the terrace underneath the kid.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.266
ED:
Wordy and I are standing by.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.567
Boss, I don't see you.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.202
PARKER:
You will in a second.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.370
Carlton?!

16:12.372 --> 16:13.738
(Carlton panting)

16:13.740 --> 16:15.640
Hey, just take
it easy, okay?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.275
I just don't want
to surprise you.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.509
(quietly):
Hey, Spike.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.712
Night watchman's name
is Doug Saunders.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.613
See if that raises any flags.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.483
You got it.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.151
Carlton?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.220
Hey, Carlton?

16:29.222 --> 16:30.455
(grunts)

16:30.457 --> 16:32.256
Hey, buddy.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.292
I'm Sergeant Parker.

16:34.294 --> 16:38.129
You're a hard man to
get a meeting with.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.569
Hey, you mind just taking
a step back from the edge there?

16:44.571 --> 16:46.704
All I want to do
is talk to you.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.573
Don't come any closer!
Okay.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.242
All right, I know you
brought yourself up here

16:51.244 --> 16:54.379
for a reason, and we can
talk about that, but first...

16:54.381 --> 16:57.615
First, you know,
we're pretty precarious up here,

16:57.617 --> 17:00.518
and I just want to make sure
you don't slip accidentally,

17:00.520 --> 17:03.321
so I'm going to rig a harness
for you, okay?

17:03.323 --> 17:05.757
Hey, put this on.

17:05.759 --> 17:09.293
No? You don't
want a harness?

17:09.295 --> 17:10.595
CARLTON:
Stay away from me.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.096
PARKER:
Pretty good with heights, huh?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.632
Me, I'd rather
be anywhere else,

17:14.634 --> 17:18.269
so I'm gonna hook
myself in, okay?

17:18.271 --> 17:20.471
All right?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.374
Stay where we
can find you.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.479
Okay, boss,
I'm right underneath you.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.281
Stealth, Sam.
I want to form a bond.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.283
I don't want him distracted.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.452
Stay in that position
until I need you.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.220
ED:
Sam, the subject is

17:36.222 --> 17:37.355
ten feet south of you.

17:37.357 --> 17:40.291
Three, two, one. Mark.

17:40.293 --> 17:44.228
PARKER:
Okay, team, I need new ideas.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.530
Our boy is non-communicative.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.331
JULES:
Judson and

17:47.333 --> 17:48.783
Antony are holding
the party line.

17:48.784 --> 17:50.234
We got to crack this code
of silence.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.603
Hey, maybe if they learn
that their star point guard

17:52.605 --> 17:54.205
is suicidal, that could help.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.373
ED:
Let's get Carlton's mother
down here.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.308
I want her to paint a picture

17:57.309 --> 17:59.242
of every single stress
that he is under. I don't care

17:59.245 --> 18:01.312
if he ran out of toothpaste,
the boss needs to know it.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.814
That's affirmative.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.185
(siren wailing)

18:11.257 --> 18:13.591
KEVIN:
We dump that car,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.193
boost another on
the way out of town.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.661
You can hole up with

18:16.662 --> 18:18.128
my Hamilton boys a while,
see how this plays out.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.298
I got to go back.
Back?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.366
Carlton's not built to roll
with this kind of trouble, K.V.

18:22.368 --> 18:24.602
I got to go make sure
that he's okay.
They don't care

18:24.604 --> 18:26.471
if you play basketball
or who your friends are.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.405
They're on you because

18:27.407 --> 18:28.706
you kidnapped some dude.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.508
They're looking
for you, too.
Yeah, well.

18:30.510 --> 18:33.411
I'm in trouble
if I behave or not.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.179
Worry about your own self.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.348
16, you got no record...

18:37.350 --> 18:39.417
Kevin, come on.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.162
Eddie.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.564
WELLSTEAD:
They kicked me
out of my office.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.866
Anything I can do to help?

18:54.868 --> 18:56.534
Yeah, we'd like
to interview a few more

18:56.536 --> 18:57.869
of your players,
but classes were cancelled.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.838
Do you think
you could round them up?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.806
Yeah, I can try to get some
of the guys down here,

19:01.808 --> 19:03.441
but their numbers
are in my office.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.408
All right, we need you to stay

19:04.410 --> 19:05.610
in your office
once you're there.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.378
Okay, you need anything
else, let me know.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.913
Yeah.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.182
(crowd chatter)

19:12.619 --> 19:14.452
What are you
doing here, Cory?

19:14.454 --> 19:15.720
There's cops everywhere.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.888
Had to come and find Carlton.

19:16.890 --> 19:18.256
What the hell's going on?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.524
Carlton snapped, man.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.691
He's gonna jump.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.466
(panting)

19:29.569 --> 19:31.836
Hey, Carlton, you know
what these things are?

19:31.838 --> 19:34.238
They're anchors for, uh...

19:34.240 --> 19:35.540
(clears throat)

19:35.542 --> 19:36.807
...for window washers.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.776
I mean, those guys got
to be nuts.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.344
Don't come any closer!

19:40.346 --> 19:43.114
Okay.

19:43.115 --> 19:45.883
Your mom and your sister--
they would really like you home.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.553
And we sort of
promised them, so,

19:48.555 --> 19:51.589
will you talk to me so maybe
we can work this out,

19:51.591 --> 19:52.790
and we can both get down?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.358
Only one way down, man.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.927
Whatever your
teammates did--

19:55.929 --> 19:57.428
it can be
undone, son.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.331
We can even help
your friend Cory.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.234
Do you know why he
would even do this to you?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.435
It's not Cory's fault!

20:04.437 --> 20:06.704
Subject's moving,
risking a slip.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.439
Boss, you need me up there?

20:08.441 --> 20:09.607
Negative.
Hold your position.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.275
SPIKE:
Okay, surveillance tape--

20:11.277 --> 20:13.477
I can identify them
all the way through.

20:13.479 --> 20:14.946
Cory reads clear reluctance.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.548
He's being pressured and pushed
to beat on a friend.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.486
But Judson and Antony are
definitely running the show.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.255
Eastern Tech has
a strict no-hazing policy.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.623
JULES:
Yeah, yeah, that's what

20:25.625 --> 20:27.558
you both said,
but I'm not buying it.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.428
So, this is
the first time

20:30.430 --> 20:31.629
you've singled somebody out?

20:33.466 --> 20:35.933
Come on, guys.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.703
You wear the hoods
so that no one knows

20:38.705 --> 20:40.571
who's doing
the enforcement, right?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.006
This is how it's done.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.742
It's your tradition.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.611
Antony,

20:46.613 --> 20:49.447
you can't keep this
code of silence.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.450
Silence is what put Carlton
up on that roof.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.619
JUDSON:
Can't you just get him down?

20:54.621 --> 20:57.722
Not until you tell us
what put him up there

20:57.724 --> 20:59.523
in the first place.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.927
Judson, Carlton
is your teammate.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.328
You respect him.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.599
If Coach benches you,

21:08.601 --> 21:10.501
you're done.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.838
Scouts won't see you,
no scholarship, no college.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.940
Carlton started strong,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.942
but Coach doesn't
like his style.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.944
He wants more aggression.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.413
You know, killer instinct.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.348
He lost his confidence.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.950
Man, the wheels came off.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.452
The last game, he couldn't
do anything right.

21:28.454 --> 21:31.589
And Coach leaves him in
to make a point.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.891
Weak links break the chain.

21:33.893 --> 21:35.526
But Cory dug us out.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.461
19 points in the
fourth quarter.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.363
It was so stupid.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.432
We won.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.968
But we still
had to book Carlton.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.537
"Book" him?

21:46.539 --> 21:48.606
(others whooping, clapping)
That's what I'm
talking about!

21:48.608 --> 21:51.542
Solid, Cory! You
were the difference!

21:51.544 --> 21:55.012
(indistinct chatter)

21:55.014 --> 21:57.014
No, that's what I
was talking about!

21:57.016 --> 21:58.816
Don't worry about it, man--
you'll get your mojo back.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.484
I need it back now.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.036
They're scouting this month.

22:02.037 --> 22:03.587
Forget that--
don't let Coach in your kitchen.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.389
All right?
You got to play above him.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.730
What the hell are
you guys celebrating for?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.598
Hmm?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.668
Now, some of you
still think you're
playing on the corner,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.837
nobody but the girl
from the hood watching.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.005
Well, guess what, gentlemen?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.373
You're not.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.008
You're in my house.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.010
And I built this house
so professional scouts

22:26.012 --> 22:27.878
can come and
see warriors,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.047
not half-ass homeboys!

22:32.018 --> 22:34.685
(kicks phone book across floor)

22:34.687 --> 22:36.854
You see, Carlton,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.789
it's not enough to
just win the game,

22:38.791 --> 22:40.424
you've got to
win the fight.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.360
You lose the ball,
you win it back.

22:42.362 --> 22:46.030
You lose your balls
on my team...

22:46.032 --> 22:49.800
then you're gonna have
to pay to get them back.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.706
(loud thump)

22:55.708 --> 23:00.644
(phone book thumping,
Carlton grunting)

23:00.646 --> 23:03.647
(Carlton pants)

23:03.649 --> 23:05.716
(phone book thumps,
Carlton groans)

23:17.029 --> 23:18.896
CARLTON:
Do it, Cory.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.731
It's okay.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.899
No, it's not.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.067
I beg your pardon?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.802
He's paid enough.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.406
All right.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.808
You had a
good game, hmm?

23:30.810 --> 23:33.611
'Kay, get up, Carlton.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.680
Your friend bailed
you out again.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.582
Hit the showers.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.951
All of you, hit the showers.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.654
Jud, Antony,

23:43.656 --> 23:46.757
Cory, come here for a second.

23:47.627 --> 23:50.594
Cory had a choice.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.163
Basically,

23:52.165 --> 23:55.099
prove his loyalty
by teaching Carlton a lesson,

23:55.101 --> 23:57.902
or ride the pine
and kiss college ball good-bye.

23:57.904 --> 24:00.738
That's how it works around here.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.840
JUDSON:
"Whatever it takes."

24:03.976 --> 24:06.444
Coach's motto.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.746
Okay, the attacks
are definitely top-down.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.815
It's systemic
and not quietly sanctioned.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.817
Coach Wellstead
ordered the attack.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.452
He told them how.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.720
Go get him.
I got the coach.

24:16.722 --> 24:18.122
Wordy's on
the ground.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.668
Boss, we got a situation.

24:37.243 --> 24:39.043
Coach Wellstead's
not in his office.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.612
I got blood on the desk,
blood on the floor.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.147
There's signs of a struggle.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.182
We may have
unauthorized persons in here.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.984
ED (over headset):
We need to sweep the building.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.486
Wordy's spotting. Sam?

24:48.488 --> 24:51.255
I might have to go up
and flank the boss, Ed.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.189
That's affirmative.
I need Sam with me.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.157
Jules.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.158
I'm about to sit down

24:54.160 --> 24:55.559
with Mrs. Hayward.

24:55.561 --> 24:56.694
We could use her intel up here.

24:56.696 --> 24:57.962
Spike, can you leave the truck?

24:57.964 --> 24:59.163
I need some backup here.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.499
Two minutes.

25:03.970 --> 25:06.136
PARKER:
Carlton, I'm not gonna
pretend to understand

25:06.138 --> 25:08.806
the pain you're in,
but I now understand

25:08.808 --> 25:10.574
that Cory did not
want to hurt you,

25:10.576 --> 25:11.842
that he was forced to.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.879
I started it.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.680
No, you didn't
start it.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.182
Coach Wellstead
started it.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.118
I'm the one who folded--
I stepped to the line,

25:21.120 --> 25:24.221
I can't even hit
a free throw anymore.
Hey, Carlton, it's windy

25:24.223 --> 25:27.758
up here-- just take a step back,
just please take a step back.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.993
Nothing. No sign.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.694
How's it read to you, Spike?

25:33.299 --> 25:35.733
I don't know,
the building's locked down.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.835
Someone get in
to assault the coach,

25:37.837 --> 25:39.603
or did he assault someone else?

25:39.605 --> 25:43.040
All right, let's keep looking.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.010
I got something.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.311
ED:
What do you got, Spike?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.246
I'm at a trophy case,
all basketball,

25:49.248 --> 25:51.315
and I'm looking
at a photo of Doug Saunders.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.316
The janitor.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.584
Eastern Tech

25:53.586 --> 25:55.286
Warriors, 1993.

25:55.288 --> 25:59.123
No red flags in the database,
but this is a familiar uniform.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.559
DOUG:
<i> I didn't do anything</i>
<i> to Wellstead.</i>

26:01.561 --> 26:02.560
Then where is he?

26:02.562 --> 26:03.861
We know that
you played for him,

26:03.863 --> 26:05.780
that you didn't
make senior squad,

26:05.781 --> 26:07.698
and we know that you
dropped out, right?
Yeah, that's right.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.766
You held a grudge.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.601
I guess so;
something like one.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.036
Did you go see him
in his office today?

26:12.038 --> 26:13.571
No.
But you knew what

26:13.573 --> 26:14.638
Carlton was going through?
No.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.273
Yeah, you did.
You knew that Cory

26:16.275 --> 26:18.275
was being forced to beat him.
No.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.610
No. I did, but I didn't--

26:19.611 --> 26:20.944
just like everyone else
around here.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.780
What do you mean by that?

26:22.782 --> 26:23.981
Whatever it takes to win.

26:23.983 --> 26:26.150
Easter Tech Warriors. Hoo-ah.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.751
(sighs)

26:27.753 --> 26:28.986
Every year

26:28.988 --> 26:30.754
he-he bonds the team

26:30.756 --> 26:32.957
by turning on the weak,
or guys that are too strong,

26:32.959 --> 26:34.325
guys like Carlton.

26:34.327 --> 26:36.160
And you people turn a blind eye

26:36.162 --> 26:37.761
because he gets results.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.797
For years, this place has
been sacrificing kids

26:39.799 --> 26:41.031
for victories.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.033
Two decades.
That's
not true.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.368
Basketball is out of my sphere.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.805
Ma'am, if you are in charge,
this is your sphere.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.708
Look, Doug, we're here
because someone else

26:50.710 --> 26:52.276
is going through
what you've been through,

26:52.278 --> 26:53.611
and right now,

26:53.613 --> 26:54.912
he is suicidal.

26:54.914 --> 26:55.980
I know.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.748
So tell us
what you know

26:57.750 --> 26:58.716
so that we can help.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.217
You can stop this.

27:00.219 --> 27:04.021
I only wish I had the guts
to do it myself.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.724
I let Cory in
the building,

27:06.726 --> 27:08.926
and I gave him the key
to the boiler room.

27:08.928 --> 27:09.960
Okay.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.830
ED:
Spike, we have a location.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.398
Come with me.
You can help. Come on.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.767
MRS. HAYWARD:
<i> A recruiter</i>

27:16.769 --> 27:19.136
told me to get Carlton
into Coach Wellstead's program.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.738
The man's a legend.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.239
City championships,

27:22.241 --> 27:24.642
regional titles,
national titles.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.644
He landed kids
NCAA scholarships.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.946
Some of them even
made it to the NBA.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.948
I pulled every string I could.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.752
I pushed my son into his arms.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.388
We all want our
loved ones to succeed.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.756
It's okay, Mommy.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.991
(Mrs. Hayward crying, sniffling)

27:40.993 --> 27:43.894
Please bring my son down safe.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.999
DOUG:
It's structural
behind the drywall,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.167
two feet of poured concrete.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.069
The door's steel skin,
solid core

27:52.071 --> 27:53.904
and barred from the inside.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.840
No windows at all?
It's like a bomb shelter.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.742
Can we get eyes in?
Maybe through the vent.

27:58.744 --> 27:59.877
Let's do it.
Copy.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.145
Is there a phone

28:01.147 --> 28:02.780
in there?
Yeah.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.316
I brought it on myself.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.352
It's my mess.

28:08.354 --> 28:11.188
Carlton's shouldering guilt
for what Wellstead initiated.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.823
The whole team's
an abuse victim.

28:12.825 --> 28:13.991
They're blaming themselves.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.793
PARKER: Yeah, you're on
to something, Sam.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.027
Stand by for my signal.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.162
I've got an idea,

28:18.164 --> 28:19.997
and I'm gonna need you up here.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.999
(ringing)

28:22.001 --> 28:24.735
(groaning weakly)

28:24.737 --> 28:27.838
Cory, my name's Ed Lane--
I'm with the SRU.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.207
Do you mind if I come in
and speak with you for a second?

28:30.209 --> 28:31.442
Not gonna happen.

28:31.444 --> 28:33.010
All right, Cory,
listen to me.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.012
We know what you and Carlton
have been through.

28:35.014 --> 28:38.248
The only way to deal
with Coach Wellstead

28:38.250 --> 28:39.850
is to let us handle it.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.884
Hand him over to us.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.353
There's other ways!

28:42.354 --> 28:43.821
Yeah, but, Cory,
you want to do this

28:43.823 --> 28:45.122
the right way here, son.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.924
Just tell me how he's doing.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.426
You all right, Coach?

28:48.427 --> 28:49.927
(groans weakly)
Yeah, he says
he knows

28:49.929 --> 28:52.863
he's got to pay to play.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.935
You don't know what it's like,

28:57.937 --> 29:00.404
especially for
the third-string guys.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.473
It's worse for them.

29:02.475 --> 29:03.807
You see?

29:03.809 --> 29:06.009
You see how much
you care for your team?

29:06.011 --> 29:07.511
That's why you're a point guard,

29:07.513 --> 29:09.346
that's why you're a leader.
I participated.

29:09.348 --> 29:13.150
I had to beat guys down, too.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.918
Carlton wasn't
hard enough for him!

29:14.920 --> 29:18.021
Even though he's got
more talent than any of us,

29:18.023 --> 29:19.957
we still had to break him!

29:19.959 --> 29:21.158
No, he tried...

29:21.160 --> 29:22.459
I broke him!

29:22.461 --> 29:23.827
Me!

29:23.829 --> 29:26.363
I took the bait, man.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.500
Court time over my friend.

29:29.502 --> 29:32.002
Cory, he had to use you--
you were both too strong.

29:32.004 --> 29:34.238
Carlton was too strong.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.440
A team run on fear
is not a team.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.443
My teammate Sam,
down below us.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.878
(over headset):
Hey, Sam, come up here.

29:40.880 --> 29:41.879
I trust my life

29:41.881 --> 29:44.014
in his hands.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.051
Hey, Carlton.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.854
I'm just gonna
hang out here, okay?

29:50.856 --> 29:54.224
What, you think I'm doing
this all by myself?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.893
Sam's got my back.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.194
In fact, if
you step back

29:57.196 --> 29:58.796
a little bit
and look down there,

29:58.798 --> 30:00.964
you see that-- that guy
with the binoculars?

30:00.966 --> 30:02.566
You see him?

30:02.568 --> 30:04.835
That's Wordy.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.276
I'm looking after you,
Sam's looking after me,

30:12.278 --> 30:14.478
and Wordy's got all our backs.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.879
Just let him go here, Cory.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.915
Let us deal with it.
I got to finish this.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.016
(groans)

30:19.018 --> 30:20.284
Whatever it takes.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.556
Cory.

30:25.558 --> 30:26.590
PARKER:
<i> We all make mistakes.</i>

30:26.592 --> 30:28.559
We all have bad games.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.160
Basketball is everything
and now it's gone.

30:30.162 --> 30:31.395
It's not gone,

30:31.397 --> 30:33.096
it's not gone,
it's only the beginning.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.065
You're going to get
that scholarship,

30:35.067 --> 30:37.935
but you're on two separate
teams right now, Carlton,

30:37.937 --> 30:40.137
and the poisoned basketball team
you got to walk away from.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.905
Your mother, your sister,
and Cory, too--

30:41.907 --> 30:44.274
that's your other team,
that's long-term.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.477
Nobody's going to cut
you from that squad.

30:53.986 --> 30:56.386
(Wellstead groaning)

31:05.631 --> 31:07.898
WELLSTEAD:
What are you doing?

31:08.868 --> 31:12.035
Cory, what are you doing?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.504
What, are you crazy?

31:14.506 --> 31:16.039
Wha... hey, what
are you doing?

31:16.041 --> 31:18.075
ED:
Where we at, Spike?

31:18.077 --> 31:19.076
I'm close.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.077
Eyes in.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.912
We're up.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.248
What is that, a blowtorch?

31:28.387 --> 31:30.520
Wellstead's tied up.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.356
This is bad.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.991
DOUG:
I think I know
what he's doing.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.926
Eastern Tech Warriors.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.061
We all got 'em--
Coach's loyalty test.

31:39.632 --> 31:40.964
Shape charge, ASAP.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.165
Blow the door, we're going in.

31:52.544 --> 31:55.412
Look, I know there's a
lot of pressure, right?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.680
There's a lot
of pressure.

31:56.682 --> 31:59.216
The pressure's got to be
inescapable right now.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.418
You're supposed
to carry your team

32:01.419 --> 32:03.619
and you're supposed to carry
your family's dreams, too.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.423
Jules, you copy?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.391
JULES:
Copy, Sam.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.625
I got your mother right here.

32:08.627 --> 32:10.394
She's right here
in the building right now.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.229
No. Oh, no.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.531
Of course she is, and she is
nothing but proud of you.

32:14.533 --> 32:17.167
Tell them that we're working it
through nice and slow.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.435
We need their help, okay?

32:18.437 --> 32:20.971
Okay, I'll get her on the line.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.205
(dialing)

32:22.207 --> 32:24.241
You can't talk
to Carlton directly,

32:24.243 --> 32:27.077
but you can relay a message
through my sergeant.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.478
Speak from the heart.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.546
He needs
perspective.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.481
He is very overwhelmed
right now.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.450
Hello?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.585
I got her on the line
right here.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.388
You're just saying that.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.389
No, she's right here.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.375
She says hello.

32:41.376 --> 32:43.360
Say something personal,
something you both share.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.396
Tell him...

32:46.398 --> 32:49.566
tell him I'm sorry
I pushed him to the paint.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.452
He should have gone for three.

32:51.453 --> 32:53.337
She says she's sorry she
pushed you to the paint

32:53.339 --> 32:55.706
and that you should
have gone for three.

32:55.708 --> 32:59.409
There's other teams,
other things in life.

32:59.411 --> 33:02.479
And you are so much more
than who you are on that court.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.364
(sobbing)

33:04.365 --> 33:06.248
And that she wants
you to be happy.

33:06.251 --> 33:09.152
I hid like you told me to.

33:09.154 --> 33:12.255
Your sister-- she says that
she hid like you told her to

33:12.257 --> 33:14.758
and that she sent us
after the bad guys, but, uh...

33:14.760 --> 33:17.160
maybe one day you
can explain to her

33:17.162 --> 33:18.729
that they weren't
the real bad guys.

33:21.767 --> 33:26.570
Tell him I love him
and I want him to come home.

33:26.572 --> 33:31.141
Do you see that the only way
you could disappoint anyone

33:31.143 --> 33:34.544
is by taking your own life?

33:34.546 --> 33:37.547
Nobody hurts so bad
they can't recover.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.284
And all you
got to do...

33:41.286 --> 33:43.353
is take my hand.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.024
Trust me.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.592
(sobbing softly)

34:08.614 --> 34:09.813
He's got him.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.782
Carlton's secure.
He's got him.

34:11.784 --> 34:14.684
(gasping, sobbing)

34:14.686 --> 34:16.620
He's okay.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.622
Get away from me.

34:18.624 --> 34:19.656
Don't you dare.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.192
(both grunting)

34:22.194 --> 34:24.361
Subjects are in the southwest
corner, out of line of the door.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.662
That's good, 'cause it's
gonna be a big bang,

34:25.664 --> 34:26.830
and it's blowing inward.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.433
(both grunting)

34:29.435 --> 34:30.667
<i> Breaching in three,</i>

34:30.669 --> 34:32.636
two, one.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.804
(explosion)

34:33.806 --> 34:35.705
(groans)

34:37.676 --> 34:39.709
Cory, right
there, drop it!

34:39.711 --> 34:40.710
Drop it!

34:40.712 --> 34:41.711
Put it down!

34:41.713 --> 34:42.712
Right there!

34:42.714 --> 34:44.381
Do what he says, Cory.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.682
Sir, let me do the talking.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.651
Cory, listen at me.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.619
I have to consider
that blowtorch a deadly weapon.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.138
That means if you
show imminent threat

34:51.139 --> 34:52.656
to use it,
I have to shoot here, son.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.091
Isn't this imminent?

34:54.093 --> 34:55.759
Sir, please be quiet
and do not struggle!

34:55.761 --> 34:58.361
ED: Cory, I don't want
to shoot you here.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.362
All right?
I don't.

34:59.364 --> 35:00.597
So lower the weapon.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.365
You don't have to put it down,
but just move it

35:02.367 --> 35:03.700
away from his face
and we can talk, okay?

35:05.471 --> 35:07.637
That's it.

35:09.274 --> 35:12.642
This here... this is
all it boils down to for me.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.743
ED:
No, it isn't, Cory.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.312
No, it isn't.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.581
I saw red!

35:17.583 --> 35:18.882
I went off on my friend!

35:18.884 --> 35:20.450
You know what
Carlton told me?

35:20.452 --> 35:22.352
"Not Cory's fault."

35:22.354 --> 35:24.588
Those were his exact words, son.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.589
But you know what?

35:25.591 --> 35:27.725
There is fault here.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.860
And I promise you we are gonna
make sure that it comes out.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.695
And that's what you
want is justice, Cory.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.080
That's what you want.

35:33.081 --> 35:34.464
Justice? I don't
have to face justice.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.665
Sir, please be quiet!

35:35.667 --> 35:37.334
No, I'm not gonna be quiet.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.869
My record speaks for
itself, all right?

35:38.871 --> 35:40.170
Sir!

35:40.172 --> 35:41.638
You don't care
if Carlton lives or dies?

35:41.640 --> 35:43.306
Cory, don't, don't!

35:43.308 --> 35:44.574
Shoot him!

35:44.576 --> 35:45.742
Sir, you pull yourself together.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.477
Cory, this is not
what I want to do.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.246
Please.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.248
Please.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.452
It's all right.

35:55.454 --> 35:56.453
Hey, hey.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.454
You're doing fine, Carlton.

35:57.456 --> 35:58.688
Have a seat.
I'm shaking.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.190
That's because
your heart's racing.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.491
Just sit down.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.893
Sit down.

36:02.895 --> 36:03.894
So is mine, pal.

36:03.896 --> 36:04.928
We're all good, okay?

36:04.930 --> 36:06.396
You showed a lot
of strength.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.298
You just keep breathing.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.299
You have some water.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.367
We're in no hurry.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.604
Boss.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.673
We'll be right
back, son.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.209
You hold tight.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.443
I know, way outside the box,

36:20.445 --> 36:22.279
but what if we tell him
what Cory's doing?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.881
Ah, that's
too risky.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.482
I know, but we have
two critical incidents.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.350
Maybe one
can help the other.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.351
Carlton's a team player.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.352
His teammate needs him.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.487
WORDY:
It could work, boss.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.621
Get him proactive,
helping his friend.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.723
I think that's
a good idea down here.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.425
Agreed.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.494
PARKER:
Okay, he's gone through
a lot today, but he may be

36:37.496 --> 36:39.462
the only one who can reach
his friend. All right.

36:39.464 --> 36:41.531
Let's do it.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.969
Carlton, I need
to tell you something,

36:45.971 --> 36:48.872
and I need you
to be strong.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.708
It's about Cory.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.876
Where is he? Is he okay?

36:52.878 --> 36:53.944
He's fine.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.280
He's just in the middle
of doing something

36:57.282 --> 36:59.216
that he's going to regret.

36:59.218 --> 37:01.484
(phone beeps)

37:03.422 --> 37:04.921
The police,

37:04.923 --> 37:07.224
the school--
everybody knows the truth.

37:07.226 --> 37:09.492
But Cory thinks
he's doing that for you.

37:09.494 --> 37:11.828
That's revenge for
ripping apart your friendship

37:11.830 --> 37:13.496
and pushing you
out on that roof.

37:13.498 --> 37:14.764
Well, you have to stop him.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.666
Will you help us do that?

37:18.470 --> 37:19.636
ED:
Cory, Carlton's okay.

37:19.638 --> 37:20.704
He came down, he's fine.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.705
I promise you that.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.473
You're just saying that!

37:23.475 --> 37:24.674
No, I'm not, Cory.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.643
He's okay. He's here.
He's gonna come in

37:26.645 --> 37:28.445
and talk to you.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.813
PARKER:
Coming in, Eddie.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.548
It's okay.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.455
CORY:
C-Carlton.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.656
I-I'm sorry.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.707
I-I didn't want you...

37:40.708 --> 37:41.757
CARLTON:
I know, I know.
Coach...

37:41.760 --> 37:43.526
I know. Don't worry about it.

37:43.528 --> 37:45.362
Cory, put the
blowtorch down.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.429
Do it for me.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.498
So much for the season.
No.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.967
Man... plenty more games.

37:50.969 --> 37:54.004
ED:
Cory, you don't want
to be like him.

37:54.006 --> 37:57.374
You don't want to do what
he does, so just let him go.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.342
CARLTON:
The coach is the loser here.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.011
Seriously.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.482
He's done.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.319
We're not.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.793
("Catch Me When I Fall"
by Daniel Cage playing)

38:26.872 --> 38:29.873
¶ When the rain comes down ¶

38:29.875 --> 38:32.942
¶ And there's
no one else around ¶

¶ When I'm feeling down ¶

38:35.814 --> 38:40.050

38:40.052 --> 38:43.653
¶ Well, catch me when I ¶

38:49.661 --> 38:52.696

38:55.701 --> 38:58.702

38:58.704 --> 39:01.638

¶ And each one shines upon me ¶

39:16.688 --> 39:20.390
¶ Couldn't help
but remind me of my dreams ¶

39:20.392 --> 39:22.826
Hey. Sam.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.861
You were great up there.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.563
You know,
the whole idea about

39:26.565 --> 39:27.797
bringing Cory
and Carlton together.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.099
It was a little risky.

39:29.101 --> 39:30.800
I thought inspired.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.035
STEVE:
Jules.

39:33.772 --> 39:34.971
There you are.
Hey!

39:34.973 --> 39:36.373
You again.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.774
Steve.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.008
How's it going, man?

39:39.010 --> 39:41.978
I got to go talk to Spike.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.814
So what do you say?

39:44.816 --> 39:45.915
Burger and fries?

39:45.917 --> 39:46.916
Like the old days?

39:46.918 --> 39:47.917
I don't know, Steve.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.753
That was a long time ago.

39:49.755 --> 39:50.820
Come on.

39:50.822 --> 39:53.556
Think we can
do better than that.

39:53.558 --> 39:54.791
(both chuckle)

39:54.793 --> 39:56.860
¶ Yeah ¶

39:56.862 --> 39:58.161
¶ Well, catch me when I fall. ¶
