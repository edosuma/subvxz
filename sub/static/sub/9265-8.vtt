00:20.145 --> 00:22.329
While you're heading east,
I'll fix up this {\Garrity }house{\ real nice}.

00:22.454 --> 00:24.773
- We're gonna turn a major profit.
- We'll see what happens{\, OK?}.

00:25.170 --> 00:26.246
I love you.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.485
The girl that came here,
her name is Ally Darcy.

00:28.917 --> 00:31.404
I hooked up with her five years ago.
There's no way that kid's mine.

00:31.574 --> 00:33.448
- You're not lying{\ to me}?
- I'll never lie to you.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.567
This is my man, right here,
my soon-to-be agent, Grant Halbert.

00:36.692 --> 00:39.746
All you gotta do is sign{\, baby. Jason, nice meeting you}.
If you're in the Big Apple, ring me up.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.456
You get your head in this game...

00:41.860 --> 00:44.297
- Joe, I need my quarterback.
- I'm talking to my boy.

00:44.457 --> 00:46.670
{\All I'm asking is you to }Give the kid some room to breathe,
so I can work with him.

00:46.835 --> 00:48.760
- {\It's a }Job well done, fellas!
- {\All right. So }What's next?

00:48.920 --> 00:51.883
- Do we call that realtor lady?
- No, we sell the house ourselves.

00:52.048 --> 00:54.928
- We got an offer on the house.
- You're kidding me? Are you serious?

00:56.517 --> 00:58.912
- I love this life.
- You can't. That's not a cheers.

00:59.037 --> 01:01.226
- You're just thinking out loud.
- I {\can }do what I wanna do.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.358
How about this?
To...

01:04.260 --> 01:05.980
- money!
- No, wait!

01:07.205 --> 01:09.901
To being bad-ass
real estate guys who just...

01:10.895 --> 01:12.697
- To money!
- To money!

01:13.915 --> 01:16.892
- What are we gonna do with that money?
- {\Dude,}I'm calling Mindy up{\ on the phone} and {\I'm }telling her,

01:17.017 --> 01:19.494
"{\Sweetie, }You don't ever have to shake
your ass at the Landing Strip again."

01:19.783 --> 01:22.455
{\No, }I'm thinking about one or two things{\, maybe}.
Either open up an orphanage,

01:22.776 --> 01:26.194
or B, I'm gonna go ahead and see how
many margaritas I can buy with 14 grand.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.712
- I'm in for the latter.
- I'd like to see your orphanage.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.465
Six, you're up, go.

01:31.036 --> 01:32.939
Me, I'm gonna take a little trip
to New York

01:33.064 --> 01:36.112
and get a job in a sports agency
with my friend Grant that I met and...

01:36.237 --> 01:38.091
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

01:40.312 --> 01:41.862
Who the hell is Grant?

01:42.401 --> 01:43.937
He's a guy I met once.

01:44.325 --> 01:47.439
So you're just gonna get up
and move to New York?

01:49.133 --> 01:51.527
{\Well, }Not New York, New Jersey.
I'm gonna live in New Jersey

01:51.652 --> 01:53.560
with Noah and Erin,
and then I'm gonna...

01:53.685 --> 01:56.531
commute into New York
for my fancy sports agent job.

01:57.687 --> 01:59.757
Why would you wanna leave Texas?

02:00.754 --> 02:03.121
'Cause it's not about Texas anymore,
it's about Erin and Noah.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.708
OK, when do we leave, Six?

02:11.257 --> 02:13.290
- I can't believe it.
- Isn't it great? Now listen.

02:13.415 --> 02:14.485
Did I tell you?

02:14.610 --> 02:17.624
It's gonna go on the market in 3 days,
which means this baby's gonna sell.

02:17.749 --> 02:20.637
Now, everyone is gonna want this house.
So we gotta move fast.

02:20.762 --> 02:23.153
I can't believe it.
It's just... This is perfect.

02:23.278 --> 02:26.339
It's everything that Eric and I have
been talking about for so many years.

02:26.464 --> 02:27.812
It's like my dream house.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.593
I{\'m gonna} call the realtor, tell her
we're gonna make an offer.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.735
No, I don't think
we should do that quite yet.

02:34.042 --> 02:37.197
- I need to, you know...
- It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

02:37.586 --> 02:39.383
Tami, it's a foreclosure.

02:40.018 --> 02:41.984
{\I know, }It{\ does} seems like it's a good price,
but it's still...

02:42.109 --> 02:46.039
For us, it's probably a little bit
of a stretch, you know, financially.

02:46.209 --> 02:47.572
OK, look at it.

02:47.697 --> 02:50.934
You deserve this.
Really, you really, really do.

02:51.059 --> 02:53.171
And you can sell your house,
you'd have that income.

02:53.873 --> 02:57.805
And you're the principal{\, for crying out loud}!
He's the head coach. You can do this.

02:57.930 --> 02:58.931
You can.

02:59.051 --> 03:02.610
I don't know that he's gonna
look at it that way necessarily.

03:04.296 --> 03:06.024
So I have to leave for six months.

03:06.149 --> 03:09.163
I'm gonna be by myself,
on the road, every night,

03:09.329 --> 03:11.397
and possibly come back
with a broken outcome.

03:11.940 --> 03:15.390
You know, last time I checked, you're
a cowboy, that's your job, am I right?

03:15.515 --> 03:17.309
Yeah, I guess you're right.

03:18.435 --> 03:20.085
You sure you can't come?

03:21.368 --> 03:23.618
I'd love to, but I have
this little thing called school.

03:24.260 --> 03:26.902
Just for{\, like,} a couple of days.
You can't come for a couple of days?

03:27.027 --> 03:29.339
I have a college interview.

03:29.868 --> 03:31.118
It's this week.

03:31.665 --> 03:34.838
Well, then you can't come.
That's important.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.287
But I will...

03:39.273 --> 03:41.761
be thinking about you
every day, and...

03:42.381 --> 03:45.642
we'll talk all the time
on the phone, and...

03:46.402 --> 03:47.852
you'll be back soon.

03:48.506 --> 03:49.544
Right?

03:51.145 --> 03:52.595
Yeah, I'll be back.

04:06.548 --> 04:08.468
92 coming in, there he is!

04:09.219 --> 04:11.591
This is for our win
last week, gentlemen.

04:11.716 --> 04:14.335
If effort equals success,
we shouldn't have won that game.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.338
Act like you've done this before,
let's go!

04:17.839 --> 04:20.550
No, we've been doing this
all year, let's go.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.552
There he is. Drop it!

04:22.852 --> 04:24.764
- Let's go.
- Lead him in!

04:25.168 --> 04:27.348
Jesus! You gotta catch that
if it's in your hand!

04:29.062 --> 04:31.603
There he is. Man, man, man!
Hit him inside.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.814
Are you serious? Jamarcus,
what the hell are you doing?

04:35.264 --> 04:37.610
- I'm running my route.
- You're supposed to run a post.

04:37.730 --> 04:39.777
- You know what a post is?
- {\Man, }He threw it to me wrong.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.308
- Coach, can I show him what a post is?
- Go ahead.

04:42.428 --> 04:45.074
Ain't anything worse than what we've got
out there now. Jamarcus, shut up.

04:45.792 --> 04:46.993
Blue, 8, 10!

04:48.706 --> 04:50.371
Run it out, let's go!

04:50.827 --> 04:53.084
That's the way.
Yes!

04:53.294 --> 04:54.417
We're back to 22.

04:54.587 --> 04:57.253
How come our quarterback's running
routes better than our receivers, huh?

04:57.423 --> 04:58.681
That's the way...

04:59.725 --> 05:01.519
Brian, step up there.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.352
Call 911!

06:18.818 --> 06:20.433
So, what's the plan?

06:23.792 --> 06:25.229
Six, go!

06:26.887 --> 06:30.013
The plan is to get a suit
and then I go see Grant.

06:30.309 --> 06:32.348
That's the same plan
we had the whole way up here.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.059
Oh, man, a suit. Excuse me, sir.
Sorry to bother you.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.480
Can you just let me know
where you got that suit?

06:37.605 --> 06:38.704
Paul Stuart.

06:40.788 --> 06:43.003
We need to find a Paul Stuart.

06:43.128 --> 06:46.100
Get the hands off my cab, jackass.

06:49.769 --> 06:51.719
You know where Paul Stuart's is?

07:00.054 --> 07:01.054
OK, what?

07:11.744 --> 07:13.056
- Worth it.
- Worth it.

07:14.862 --> 07:18.099
Paul Stuart.
Let's get you suited up, Six!

07:18.266 --> 07:19.687
Right here.
Do you smell that?

07:20.195 --> 07:22.232
That's success. It's right here.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.775
Right there. Right there!

07:25.042 --> 07:26.660
- That's the one.
- You think so?

07:26.780 --> 07:27.737
Look at this.

07:28.731 --> 07:29.781
How're you doing?
{\- It is nice.}

07:29.946 --> 07:32.158
- May I help you?
- What's the damage on this garb?

07:32.641 --> 07:35.805
This is woolen cashmere
imported from London.

07:36.209 --> 07:37.705
It's $1884.

07:43.324 --> 07:44.879
- Six!
- This is it?

07:45.089 --> 07:47.819
Two for $125.

07:48.612 --> 07:52.261
- That works.
- You want dark or... blue?

07:53.153 --> 07:54.703
Like, I don't know...

07:55.101 --> 07:56.974
This isn't bad, it feels nice.

07:57.378 --> 07:58.827
I mean, I don't know...

07:58.952 --> 08:01.766
- {\What do you think, }You wanna try this on?
- What if she says no, Riggs?

08:02.238 --> 08:03.815
What do you mean?
Who says no?

08:04.103 --> 08:05.136
Erin.

08:05.636 --> 08:08.571
What if Erin says no...
What if we buy these suits,

08:08.781 --> 08:10.863
and I go and I get a job
or don't get a job,

08:11.033 --> 08:14.283
and I show up at her doorstep, and I ask
her to take me back, and she says no?

08:16.684 --> 08:20.221
I don't know, man. You can play
that "what if" game all day.

08:20.346 --> 08:22.333
I believe you're doing
the right thing.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.034
I just gotta make it
so she doesn't say no.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.132
- Suits, job...
- How're you doing{\, guys}?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.801
How're you doing, sir?
We need two suits.

08:31.971 --> 08:35.919
Well, I've got two for $125, and then
I've got an extra package, $200.

08:36.044 --> 08:38.698
- What's the package?
- {\Well }You're gonna get two suits, right?

08:38.823 --> 08:41.059
Then you're gonna get
two shirts, two ties,

08:41.743 --> 08:45.022
two socks, and a free
pair of shoes, for $200.

08:46.591 --> 08:48.109
Shive. What do you think?

08:48.509 --> 08:50.987
No, I just want to get back out
on the field, that's all I wanna do.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.993
- Two weeks for practice,
- Just relax!

08:53.113 --> 08:55.663
- Two weeks to playoffs.
- You know what? We're gonna be fine.

08:55.788 --> 08:57.575
We'll be fine, we'll work it out.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.162
Take care of yourself, all right?

08:59.520 --> 09:00.867
All right, thanks.

09:02.079 --> 09:04.609
- Tell the guys hello.
- I will.

09:04.867 --> 09:07.477
Get a drink of water
with your little flexi-straw.

09:07.952 --> 09:09.787
All right, see you later, buddy.

09:10.682 --> 09:12.180
OK, so...

09:12.963 --> 09:16.292
Back to business. Here's the deal.
We gotta get a coach to replace him

09:16.417 --> 09:19.152
and I've been thinking maybe
Wade Aikmen would be a good choice.

09:19.277 --> 09:21.675
What are you talking about,
Wade Aikmen?

09:21.854 --> 09:24.099
I'm just speaking
on behalf of the boosters.

09:24.224 --> 09:26.373
When you say boosters,
you're talking about Joe McCoy.

09:26.498 --> 09:29.068
- I don't wanna talk about that crap{\right now}.
- No, I understand that.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.679
I don't wanna talk about smiling Joe
either. This is not about him.

09:31.804 --> 09:35.001
This is about Wade Aikmen
being a perfect fit at this moment.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.480
He's the kid's personal
quarterback coach,

09:37.605 --> 09:40.682
he knows the kid, he's been working
with him{\the kid}, he knows our spread offense.

09:40.807 --> 09:43.161
He's young, he's energetic,
he can pick this up,

09:43.286 --> 09:45.631
- and we can still...
- {\You know what? }Do me a favor, would you?

09:45.756 --> 09:47.960
You tell the boosters
that I'll handle this my way.

09:49.063 --> 09:50.181
Always.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.883
I'm excited about Western for you.
They actually

09:54.388 --> 09:56.679
hold a side opening specifically

09:57.020 --> 09:59.497
for kids just like you,
who didn't necessarily have

09:59.622 --> 10:01.974
the best GPA's at the beginning
but have pulled them up.

10:02.653 --> 10:05.346
You're not being given anything.
There's no hand-out here.

10:05.471 --> 10:09.106
This is {\just}about you and your hard work.
{\And I think }It's gonna be a perfect match for you.

10:09.419 --> 10:11.728
I feel good,
and I feel focused, and...

10:12.219 --> 10:13.736
I'm ready, I'm ready for this.

10:15.111 --> 10:16.461
I'm proud of you.

10:17.154 --> 10:19.253
Proud of you.
Proud of you for staying focused.

10:19.378 --> 10:22.069
You've worked hard,
gone against a lot of odds.

10:24.277 --> 10:25.627
I'm proud of you.

10:26.699 --> 10:27.699
Thank you.

10:34.477 --> 10:35.477
Coach.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.426
Here's those...

10:37.843 --> 10:39.379
Tennessee charts.

10:39.997 --> 10:41.347
Good, Matt. Thanks.

10:42.718 --> 10:44.196
- Hey, how's...
- Julie!

10:44.321 --> 10:46.071
How's Coach McGill doing?

10:46.914 --> 10:49.021
He's doing good.
I'll tell him you say hello.

10:49.321 --> 10:50.593
Thanks.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.987
Coach...
- Julie!

10:58.412 --> 11:00.620
What do you think
about the idea of...

11:00.745 --> 11:03.195
me maybe moving
over to receiver.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.445
I mean, I know all the routes.

11:07.031 --> 11:08.925
And I just kind of think
I probably would be

11:09.050 --> 11:12.430
- a bigger help to the team...
- Matt, you get yourself injured...

11:12.555 --> 11:15.089
J.D. gets himself injured,
I'm out of a quarterback, I'm screwed.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.283
Are you ready to go?

11:24.467 --> 11:26.699
- Where're you going?
- We're gonna go hang out.{\You'll be back for dinner?}

11:26.819 --> 11:29.854
- Got your cell phone? Have a good time.
- Yes, I have my cell phone.

11:30.739 --> 11:32.289
See you later, Coach.

11:41.787 --> 11:43.034
I'm here to see...

11:43.431 --> 11:44.851
Mr. Grant Halbert.

11:45.017 --> 11:47.163
- What is your name?
- Jason Street.

11:47.843 --> 11:49.624
Do you have an appointment,
Mr. Street?

11:52.286 --> 11:54.545
No, ma'am.
I don't.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.048
OK, {\well, }if you'd like to call back
and make an appointment.

11:57.218 --> 11:59.386
I don't have an appointment but I...

11:59.511 --> 12:03.138
I do know that when I met Mr. Halbert
in Texas just a little while ago,

12:03.263 --> 12:05.848
he told me specifically to come
see him when I came to New York

12:06.752 --> 12:08.976
and that's why I'm here now.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.860
I'm sure if you just
let him know Jason Street...

12:11.985 --> 12:14.891
would like to see him,
I'm sure he'd love to have me.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.716
Just Jason Street, just...

12:19.168 --> 12:20.248
Please.

12:22.454 --> 12:24.704
There's a Mr. Jason Street here.

12:27.793 --> 12:31.040
- I'm Wendell Foley's friend from Texas.
- He's Wendell's friend from Texas.

12:31.774 --> 12:33.085
There you go.

12:36.216 --> 12:37.495
Hey, Jason.

12:37.661 --> 12:40.341
- Hey, Mr. Halbert.
- What are you doing here?

12:40.676 --> 12:43.621
I just... You said to come see you
when I was in New York...

12:43.746 --> 12:45.554
I'm here now, so...
I figured I'd stop by.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.282
All right...

12:47.611 --> 12:50.661
Let's go back in the office
and talk a little bit.

12:51.174 --> 12:52.800
I will be right here.

12:53.462 --> 12:55.806
Thank you so much
for your help, ma'am.

12:58.153 --> 13:01.176
So I understand
we only met once, sir, but...

13:01.438 --> 13:03.478
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said about

13:03.603 --> 13:05.659
being a sports agent, and how...

13:06.175 --> 13:09.125
- it's the next best thing to playing...{\and I would love to...}
- Jackson! Stop, son.

13:09.499 --> 13:11.689
- It's Jason, sir.
- Quit doing this to yourself.

13:11.814 --> 13:14.465
I can start at the bottom,
there's really...

13:14.590 --> 13:16.726
It's not a problem,
I can work my way up.

13:16.851 --> 13:19.301
You're living in a dream world,
brother.

13:19.722 --> 13:22.058
This is the big time,
it's New York city. It's not Dillon

13:22.183 --> 13:25.843
where you {\go }get a job at a car dealership
just because you know all the boosters.

13:26.601 --> 13:30.151
Do you have any idea who applies
for the entry level positions?

13:31.098 --> 13:32.810
- No, sir.
- They're Harvard graduates.

13:32.935 --> 13:34.985
I'm not kidding you about that.

13:35.170 --> 13:37.398
It was a miracle
I got my ass in here.

13:37.704 --> 13:39.734
And it's gonna be a miracle
if I get to stay.

13:41.414 --> 13:42.864
Your buddy Wendell?

13:43.151 --> 13:45.661
He screwed me over. He told
he was going to sign with me.

13:46.991 --> 13:49.936
And then he goes out and gets courted
by SCI, who's the biggest,

13:50.061 --> 13:52.587
glossiest sports talent agency
in this city.

13:54.117 --> 13:55.567
Didn't even call me.

13:57.055 --> 13:59.237
Son, the only reason
I let you into this office today

13:59.362 --> 14:02.874
is because I was looking for {\some }information
about Wendell that would help me out.

14:02.999 --> 14:04.201
That's it.

14:07.936 --> 14:11.265
- Well, thank you for your time.
- Welcome to New York City, son.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.942
Just eat one more bite, sweetheart.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.252
One more...
Oh, honey pie...

14:24.377 --> 14:26.712
I gotta tell you,
Buddy just pisses me off.

14:27.869 --> 14:31.021
Getting Wade out there
for Joe McCoy, that's just...

14:31.146 --> 14:32.745
I don't get it,
and it pisses me off.

14:32.954 --> 14:36.204
I know but you know what? Here's one
thing you might want to think about.

14:36.329 --> 14:38.083
You are gonna need
a replacement for Mac.

14:39.232 --> 14:41.004
And you know,
Wade is good with J.D.,

14:41.129 --> 14:43.756
and you're gonna need J.D. to be good
in order to get in the playoffs.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.392
One more bite...

14:46.106 --> 14:48.219
- Well, thank you very much.
- Well, I'm just saying

14:48.389 --> 14:51.571
you're going to have to replace Mac
and it might be the lesser of two evils.

14:51.696 --> 14:54.315
'Cause you know
he'd be a good replacement.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.685
- That's my sweet girl.
- Maybe I ought to hire you.

14:56.894 --> 14:59.813
Thank you, that'd be good.
Honey, that looks delicious, thank you.

15:00.341 --> 15:02.473
Well, you know, I actually

15:02.862 --> 15:04.791
wanted to talk to you
about something.

15:04.916 --> 15:07.488
Because I went and saw this house
the day before yesterday

15:07.923 --> 15:10.054
that's about to go on the market...

15:11.023 --> 15:13.420
and I have to tell you, honey,

15:13.586 --> 15:16.270
I know we have not talked
about this in a long time,

15:16.395 --> 15:17.794
but this house...

15:18.189 --> 15:20.501
I walked in, and I thought,
"This is our future."

15:20.796 --> 15:23.921
You would have a place for an office,
we'd have a yard for Gracie Belle.

15:24.712 --> 15:28.082
- I {\just }thought to myself, this could be{\ the perfect}...
- Did you find this house by yourself?

15:28.207 --> 15:30.219
No, I went with Katie McCoy.

15:30.662 --> 15:33.148
Yeah, 'cause you know,
she{\does a little...,} dabbles in a little

15:33.314 --> 15:35.594
- real estate and she heard about it.
- She heard about that?

15:35.719 --> 15:36.559
Honey...

15:36.849 --> 15:39.353
- I'm just asking.
- {\Well, }I'm just telling you about this house

15:39.523 --> 15:42.792
because I was {\really }excited about it and I'd
love for you to go look at it with me{\this week}.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.778
We need to kind of go soon

15:44.944 --> 15:48.286
'cause it's gonna go on the market
and it's gonna go like that. Please?

15:48.411 --> 15:49.453
Please?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.330
Hon?

16:01.032 --> 16:02.995
I cannot believe that I actually

16:03.452 --> 16:05.671
went into Grant's office
and expected him to give me a job.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.935
I'm an idiot in a wheelchair, which is
the {\only }reason he{\ even} let me in that office

16:09.060 --> 16:12.850
because he remembered the wheelchair.
That's all everybody remembers me for{\, man}.

16:12.975 --> 16:16.348
- The wheelchair.
- {\OK, }You know what? Drop the violin, Six.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.782
OK, let's take a beat, here.
Where are we right now? Where are we?

16:19.907 --> 16:21.604
- Time Square.
- Time Square, Big Apple.

16:22.005 --> 16:23.861
Taking a big bite out of it.

16:24.021 --> 16:26.978
You know what else we got?
We got Gypsy tonight.

16:27.363 --> 16:29.486
- There's strippers in it.
- I don't wanna see Gypsy.

16:30.167 --> 16:33.959
- What do you mean{\ you don't wanna see Gipsy}?
- My life's falling apart around me{\, Riggins}, OK?

16:34.084 --> 16:36.884
Last thing I wanna do is go see
a Broadway show for 3 hours with you.

16:37.009 --> 16:40.979
"You feel that you're watching a woman
who has peeled down

16:41.104 --> 16:45.002
- to her unadorned id."
- Riggs!

16:46.162 --> 16:48.170
- What?
- I'm sorry but it's not working.

16:48.295 --> 16:51.088
I appreciate the fact you're trying
to cheer me up, but it's not gonna work.

16:51.213 --> 16:53.804
The only thing that'll{\s gonna} cheer me up
is having my boy in my arms,

16:53.929 --> 16:56.204
and it doesn't look like it's gonna
happen any time soon.

16:56.542 --> 16:59.638
You know what?
You want your boy in your arms?

17:02.314 --> 17:04.271
Go... Go grab Wendell,

17:05.252 --> 17:07.858
bring him back to that agency,
make him sign there.

17:08.278 --> 17:11.656
'Cause {\you know what? }you're the only person
that's gonna be able to do that.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.199
You know what you'll get out of it?
A job {\that }they won't be able to deny you.

17:16.282 --> 17:18.827
And some leverage.
And that's all you need, right now.

17:19.352 --> 17:21.538
So, wait, you want me
to go down to Penn A&M

17:21.708 --> 17:24.704
and convince Wendell
that he's making a mistake, 'cause...

17:24.829 --> 17:27.752
I mean, he is making a mistake,
he's making a huge mistake.

17:30.277 --> 17:31.954
That's brilliant, Riggs!

17:33.344 --> 17:35.511
- Do it!
- So guess what we're doing tomorrow?

17:35.831 --> 17:37.915
Right after Gypsy tonight, then.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.211
Good practice, good hustle.

17:43.277 --> 17:46.477
- You ready, bud?
- I don't think we're gonna practice{\, today}.

17:46.597 --> 17:49.060
- What? Are you joking?
- I{\'m gonna} take you get something to eat. {\Go get changed.}

17:49.180 --> 17:51.360
- I'm not. Go! I'm serious.
- Really?

17:51.530 --> 17:53.946
- All right.
- I'll be here waiting on you.

17:54.751 --> 17:56.489
Do me a favor, would you?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.900
Be easy on him.
Give him some rest, right now.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.870
Yeah, I just told him that.

18:02.899 --> 18:04.865
I'm gonna take him to Applebee's.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.124
Listen...

18:08.394 --> 18:10.290
I bring you out here
as assistant coach,

18:10.415 --> 18:13.523
what do you think about that?
Mind you, it'd be temporary.

18:14.185 --> 18:16.477
I'm talking about
just until Mac gets back.

18:16.602 --> 18:17.886
- So we're clear.
- Sure.

18:18.502 --> 18:22.307
If that were to happen, J.D. can have
{\absolutely }no special treatment out here.

18:22.477 --> 18:24.601
- We can agree on that?
- I think we agree on that.

18:25.566 --> 18:28.780
- Work over {\the rest of }the details later?
- Sounds good to me.

18:31.071 --> 18:33.041
I'll see you out here tomorrow.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.768
Does your dad, like...

18:38.893 --> 18:41.618
- not like me anymore?
- Why would you say that?

18:41.833 --> 18:45.500
{\I don't know.} It seems like ever since
I got mad about him benching me,

18:45.857 --> 18:48.000
he's been mad at me,
like he's holding a grudge{\ or something}.

18:48.344 --> 18:52.138
Is this about the whole him not letting
you play wide receiver thing?

18:53.612 --> 18:54.755
Kinda.

18:55.397 --> 18:58.010
My dad's really stubborn, sometimes.
You just...

18:58.355 --> 18:59.636
{\You really just }need to work on him.

18:59.761 --> 19:01.597
- Be persistent about it.
- Really?

19:01.767 --> 19:03.716
Yeah.
I mean, it works for me.

19:05.809 --> 19:07.478
Doesn't that get annoying?

19:09.996 --> 19:11.650
I'm just really proud of you,

19:11.775 --> 19:15.027
really impressed you're gonna do this{\ thing},
even though Cash is leaving.

19:16.005 --> 19:18.380
I'm... I'm gonna miss
that boy around here.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.315
Mama, he's coming back.

19:21.380 --> 19:22.410
Baby!

19:22.813 --> 19:26.141
He's a cowboy.
He's gonna do the rodeo circuit.

19:26.311 --> 19:29.301
He's gonna have about
fifty women a day, in their...

19:29.670 --> 19:33.433
tight, painted-on-their-ass jeans
throwing themselves at him.

19:35.085 --> 19:37.508
Well, Cash isn't like that, so...
I'm not worried.

19:37.873 --> 19:38.878
It's...

19:42.391 --> 19:43.686
He's a cowboy.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.754
Tyra Collette?

19:54.359 --> 19:57.235
- Come on in.
- {\I actually... }I need to take this real quick.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.947
- Do you mind?
- No, sure. Go ahead.

20:00.238 --> 20:01.882
- Thank you.
- All right.

20:04.138 --> 20:05.429
<i>Hey, baby girl.</i>

20:05.554 --> 20:07.871
Hey. I've been trying to reach you
all day.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.782
I know, sorry{\, baby}. I've been packing up
all day, but I was gonna call you and...

20:11.907 --> 20:13.460
{\wanted to }tell you {\how much }I was gonna miss you.

20:14.076 --> 20:15.085
Me too.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.145
Can I...

20:19.145 --> 20:21.638
- Can I ask you something?
- You should know that by now,

20:21.763 --> 20:23.309
you can ask me anything.

20:24.350 --> 20:26.051
Are you gonna be faithful to me?

20:26.176 --> 20:28.851
Come on{\, Tyra}. Am I gonna be faithful to you?
What kind of question is that?

20:32.933 --> 20:36.428
<i>Damn.{\ All right, look,} I'm just gonna be honest
with you{\baby} 'cause I love you.</i>

20:37.951 --> 20:39.702
Being on the road is hard.

20:40.294 --> 20:43.324
It's real hard.
I'm gonna be gone, like, six months.

20:43.876 --> 20:46.368
A lot of long and cold nights,
I'm gonna be by myself.

20:48.712 --> 20:49.712
I mean...

20:50.249 --> 20:51.503
I'm gonna try.

20:52.234 --> 20:55.148
I'm gonna try my best to be
faithful to you 'cause I love you.

20:57.843 --> 20:59.679
I gotta go.
I have my interview.

20:59.804 --> 21:01.246
<i>All right, good luck.</i>

21:20.102 --> 21:23.485
- I'm Tyra Collette.
- Laura Davidson. Have a seat.

21:30.018 --> 21:33.790
So let's just start with you
telling me a little bit about yourself.

21:35.970 --> 21:37.477
Well, I'm from Dillon,

21:38.611 --> 21:39.820
I'm 17,

21:41.029 --> 21:42.674
and I would love...

21:43.181 --> 21:44.665
to go to college.

21:59.088 --> 22:00.984
Have you heard from Mrs. Davidson?

22:01.819 --> 22:04.066
I did, I did, and...

22:04.398 --> 22:06.406
you know, I think it went fine.

22:08.038 --> 22:10.953
We won't know anything definitive
until after the winter break anyway,

22:11.123 --> 22:14.092
so I think you should continue
with all your applications,

22:14.217 --> 22:16.621
you know, give yourself
a lot of options.

22:16.993 --> 22:19.718
And this interview experience,
it's a learning experience,

22:19.843 --> 22:22.461
so keep going
with the interview process...

22:22.739 --> 22:25.008
But I think you're on the right track,
so I'm proud of you.

22:26.627 --> 22:28.582
Well, OK. All right.

22:29.956 --> 22:30.956
All right.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.664
Good job, there you go.
16, come on.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.455
Come on, 29. Pump it.

22:42.032 --> 22:44.321
Let's go, here we go!
Hit that one!

22:44.446 --> 22:46.029
Good job, 82!
Come on, 16. Come on!

22:46.476 --> 22:48.699
Come on, 16, get back in line.

22:49.461 --> 22:52.625
Good job. Get over here.
13, 29, step up.

22:53.349 --> 22:55.517
Now watch...
Ready, 13?

22:55.637 --> 22:57.291
How's that front block drill going?

22:57.461 --> 23:00.143
{\It's going }Good. We're gonna do receiver{\, right now}.
I learned some stuff

23:00.268 --> 23:03.288
at a coaching clinic at USC,
and they seem to like it.

23:03.413 --> 23:06.122
What's Matt doing {\over }here? You realize
he gets hurt and J.D.'s not available,

23:06.247 --> 23:09.102
- I'm {\pretty much }stuck with seventh graders.
- I know, Coach. I'm playing him wide,

23:09.222 --> 23:11.346
he's not gonna get hurt.
I won't let him get hit.

23:13.123 --> 23:16.112
{\I tell you what. }This isn't USC, so let's stick
to the drills we talked about.

23:16.237 --> 23:19.016
Let's get him back to quarterback.
What do you say?

23:19.141 --> 23:21.172
Matt, get that jersey back on!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.901
Saracen, get back over there, now.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.825
Hey, Coach. How're you doing?

23:32.751 --> 23:36.125
Listen, I heard you hired Wade,
and I just wanted to say that...

23:36.250 --> 23:39.328
I'm glad you decided to set aside
our differences and...

23:39.453 --> 23:41.236
do what's best for the team.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.690
- Good.
- Good.

23:46.061 --> 23:48.091
- You have a good night.
- You too, bud.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.413
I think it's, like, four bathrooms.

23:50.538 --> 23:52.971
Isn't that crazy?
It's pretty great, right?

23:53.186 --> 23:55.451
I just love this kitchen.
And the backyard!

23:55.571 --> 23:57.559
Look at that backyard, honey!
And that grill!

23:57.915 --> 24:01.297
Can't you just see little Gracie Belle
playing back there,

24:01.422 --> 24:03.357
you throwing the ball with Jules...

24:03.634 --> 24:05.541
Is that our Julie,
or is there gonna be another?

24:05.666 --> 24:08.428
You know what I mean. We can have
parties, we can have the barbecue,

24:08.553 --> 24:10.322
we can have the football party
back here...

24:10.985 --> 24:11.985
You know...

24:15.684 --> 24:16.728
Come here.

24:20.862 --> 24:21.922
Talk to me.

24:23.958 --> 24:25.462
We cannot afford this.

24:26.234 --> 24:27.798
Well, I mean, I know it's a stretch.

24:28.065 --> 24:30.675
Babe, we can't afford it.

24:31.155 --> 24:32.464
Before you say that,

24:32.589 --> 24:35.430
- can we at least have a conversation?
- We are having a conversation.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.916
I know, but I think we need
to sit down with our finances.

24:38.041 --> 24:41.645
- This could be a great investment.
- Our mortgage would double.

24:41.810 --> 24:43.976
Hon, I know, but the point
that I'm making is that

24:44.101 --> 24:47.234
I feel like we are expanding.
I think that we actually could do it.

24:47.449 --> 24:49.444
Listen.
What happens if I lose my job?

24:50.173 --> 24:51.431
Think about that.

24:52.136 --> 24:55.992
- You're gonna win the playoffs.
- What happens if you lose your job?

24:56.644 --> 24:58.894
- Why would you say that?
- Because you could lose your job.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.565
I could lose my job.

25:00.690 --> 25:03.536
- That is the most pessimistic way{\ to think}...
- {\Honey, }I'm not being pessimistic,

25:03.661 --> 25:05.655
I'm being realistic.
We cannot afford this.

25:05.780 --> 25:08.338
I'm trying to think about our lives
and not think about it

25:08.508 --> 25:10.418
in terms of gloom and doom, and OK,

25:10.543 --> 25:12.634
we gotta stay put in one place
our whole lives.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.266
{\You know, }This is our dream house.

25:14.562 --> 25:18.147
- That's what we need to {\be }think{\ing} about.
- You know what you just said? "Our.{\ Our.}"

25:18.677 --> 25:20.308
That means the two of us.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.978
As far as my side is concerned,
I say no.

25:23.833 --> 25:26.022
- Don't just say no.
- You want me to just say yes?

25:26.344 --> 25:28.859
No! But don't just say no,

25:29.152 --> 25:31.304
without us having
a conversation about it.

25:31.429 --> 25:32.811
Where are you going?

25:32.936 --> 25:35.879
- Me? I'm gonna go outside.
- You're just gonna walk out?

25:36.004 --> 25:38.869
I'm just going out
to get some fresh air, sweetie.

25:40.404 --> 25:41.404
Sorry.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.312
There it is, Asbury Hall.

25:45.897 --> 25:47.919
That's where they said
Wendell's dorm is.

25:48.890 --> 25:50.440
I sure hope he's here,

25:50.852 --> 25:53.662
'cause if he's not, we're gonna have
to sit on the doorstep till he shows up.

25:53.782 --> 25:57.757
{\You know, }If this actually goes through...
when it actually all goes through,

25:58.136 --> 25:59.894
you're gonna have to live here...

26:00.677 --> 26:02.223
for, like... for good.

26:03.594 --> 26:05.171
Yeah, that's the plan.

26:06.299 --> 26:07.437
It is.

26:08.874 --> 26:10.921
Why? Does it bother you
a little bit?

26:17.044 --> 26:21.044
I'll be back to visit{\, man}. It's not like
I'm not gonna be back in Dillon at all.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.249
All right, well...

26:25.882 --> 26:28.114
I'm going in there alone.
I'm gonna talk to him.

26:28.476 --> 26:30.272
Stay out here
and don't get in trouble.

26:30.397 --> 26:32.436
- All right.
- I'll go get this guy.

26:32.864 --> 26:34.958
- No regrets.
- See you in a few.

26:57.592 --> 26:59.857
Heard you're not going to sign
with Grant anymore?

26:59.977 --> 27:01.688
Man, I think that's cool...

27:02.042 --> 27:05.660
if that's really what you wanna do,
if you've really thought about it,

27:06.050 --> 27:09.000
if you really see the big picture here,
but I don't think you do.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.879
What're you talking about?

27:14.999 --> 27:17.681
I don't think you see the fact
that this bigger agency,

27:18.041 --> 27:20.034
you're just another athlete
on paper to them.

27:20.154 --> 27:21.906
You're just
another paycheck to them.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.522
They're gonna collect
as many of you as they can

27:24.647 --> 27:28.311
to get another BMW in their garage.
That's what you are to them.

27:29.627 --> 27:33.107
You need someone who's young, someone
who's smart, someone who's ambitious,

27:33.232 --> 27:36.152
{\someone }who's gonna put all their attention
on you, all their passion into you,

27:36.277 --> 27:39.182
and all their drive behind making you,
because making you

27:39.307 --> 27:41.241
is gonna make them.
That's what you need.

27:41.734 --> 27:44.594
- And... Grant is that person?
- I think so.

27:44.719 --> 27:46.705
You're gonna be his present,
{\You're gonna be }his future.

27:47.084 --> 27:48.928
You're gonna be
his kids' college fund.

27:49.053 --> 27:52.595
You'll{\re gonna} be the reason he's able to put
dinner on his family's table every night

27:52.720 --> 27:56.715
and he's gonna work harder for you
because of that, because of his family.

27:56.885 --> 28:00.374
Because when success is essential
to keeping your family together,

28:00.499 --> 28:03.738
there's nothing a man will not do.

28:04.189 --> 28:05.189
OK?

28:09.020 --> 28:11.451
All I'm saying is,
give him a shot.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.285
Go and talk to him,
he can get the job done.

28:14.410 --> 28:17.442
He's been trying to get ahold of you,
and you've been ignoring him.

28:19.881 --> 28:22.108
Jason, what would you get
out of this, dude?

28:23.960 --> 28:25.944
I want Grant to give me a job.

28:29.617 --> 28:31.458
But I also want to see you succeed.

28:33.454 --> 28:35.680
So on my way back home,
I figured I'd come down here

28:35.800 --> 28:37.422
and tell you
you're making a mistake.

28:38.911 --> 28:40.441
I could've just...

28:40.566 --> 28:43.745
gone back to Dillon and said,
I didn't get a job in the city,

28:44.249 --> 28:45.249
and...

28:46.815 --> 28:50.018
Wendell's making a mistake, and I{\ really} hope
he makes it, and just left it at that.

28:51.352 --> 28:52.687
I could've done that, but...

28:54.594 --> 28:58.344
You know me. I'm not the type of guy
who just leaves things at that.

29:03.147 --> 29:05.222
There's no one else like you, man.

29:07.450 --> 29:08.661
I'm counting on that.

29:13.293 --> 29:16.670
You couldn't even wait till my body
got cold before you replaced me.

29:17.703 --> 29:19.009
With the playoffs coming up,

29:19.129 --> 29:21.174
I gotta have some help{\ somehow}.
I'm not replacing you.

29:21.453 --> 29:22.524
Wade Aikmen?

29:23.157 --> 29:26.137
- He's Joe McCoy's boy, you know that.
- Everything's understood.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.003
Until you come back,
he's interim.

29:30.348 --> 29:33.311
You got a fox in the henhouse,
that's what you got yourself.

29:33.595 --> 29:36.778
- Well, we'll see about that.
- You know what that means, don't you?

29:42.968 --> 29:45.967
I have Wendell Foley and
Jason Street here for you.

29:51.351 --> 29:52.440
Guys?

29:53.948 --> 29:55.082
Mr Halbert.

29:56.590 --> 29:58.586
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

29:59.066 --> 30:00.887
- You're here to talk?
- Well...

30:01.012 --> 30:03.868
My boy Jason brought me.
You can thank him for that.

30:05.446 --> 30:08.326
{\If }You think I'll let you leave this office
without {\you }coming back to me{\, man}, you're crazy.

30:08.451 --> 30:10.479
Come on back,
let's talk a little bit.

30:12.263 --> 30:14.144
Jason,
come sit in the meeting with us.

30:15.268 --> 30:16.658
I need you in here.

30:32.770 --> 30:36.166
- {\Miss Taylor, }It's a really good chicken.
- Good, I'm glad you're enjoying it.

30:36.381 --> 30:37.978
Nice to be complimented on the food

30:38.103 --> 30:40.495
that you've slaved over
after a long day at work.

30:41.244 --> 30:42.881
I said it was a very nice meal too{\, honey}.

30:43.434 --> 30:45.152
- It is a good meal.
- Thank you, honey.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.136
Dad, why don't you let Matt play
at wide receiver this year?

30:48.957 --> 30:50.889
We don't talk football
at the dinner table.

30:51.054 --> 30:53.641
We talk about football at breakfast,
lunch, and the dinner table.

30:53.811 --> 30:56.782
- Sweetie{\heart}, it's none of your business.
- Drop it, just drop...

30:57.807 --> 31:00.857
We're just a family having dinner,
talking about work, right?

31:02.329 --> 31:05.522
I'm just saying, he deserves it.
He's worked hard for the Panthers,

31:05.647 --> 31:08.715
it's his senior year,
he knows all the routes...

31:08.993 --> 31:11.451
He thinks like a QB,
you should at least give him a shot.

31:13.303 --> 31:15.702
All I'm asking
is you give him a shot.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.396
I'll tell you what, why don't we talk
about the house we can't afford?{\ Why don't you run with that one?}

31:19.521 --> 31:21.920
I do know the routes
just as well as anybody else, Coach.

31:22.045 --> 31:24.981
I do, I'll prove it to you too,
we can go outside and...

31:25.101 --> 31:28.389
Call ten... call ten routes,
I'll run 'em all, I miss one,

31:28.549 --> 31:31.430
I'll shut up about this,
you won't hear another word about it.

31:31.926 --> 31:35.021
You miss one, we never discuss it again.
You make 'em all, I'll think about it{\, that's it}.

31:35.518 --> 31:36.856
Is that what you're saying?

31:37.021 --> 31:38.637
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.147
Well, y'all, let's
finish dinner first!

31:49.200 --> 31:50.200
Slant.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.748
You're ready?
Set, hut!

31:57.038 --> 31:58.044
All right!

31:58.169 --> 32:00.124
- Come on! Hurry up!{\ Let's go!}
- One for one!

32:01.252 --> 32:02.252
How about a curl?

32:05.425 --> 32:08.091
- Slide, slide. - Yes, sir.
- Set, hut!

32:10.521 --> 32:11.803
Skinny post. Set, hut!

32:12.172 --> 32:13.260
Go Matt!

32:14.254 --> 32:16.146
That was a good one!

32:16.271 --> 32:19.012
Run a slide. Try using you hands
instead of your chest!

32:19.137 --> 32:20.567
Ready?
Set, hut!

32:23.520 --> 32:24.983
Six out of six!

32:25.261 --> 32:27.193
Out and up, that's right,
I know what I'm saying.

32:27.503 --> 32:28.503
Hut!

32:31.575 --> 32:32.633
That's good?

32:32.758 --> 32:34.701
Yeah, you look a little slow though.

32:34.871 --> 32:36.642
- Your legs getting tired?
- {\No, }They're good.

32:36.762 --> 32:39.176
- You{\'ve been} stretched 'em out?
- I {\just }haven't been using them much lately{\ on the bench}.

32:39.301 --> 32:42.250
You{\'ve} been sitting on the bench too long,
that's what you were gonna say?

32:44.152 --> 32:45.300
Out and up, set, hut!

32:50.911 --> 32:53.078
Nine per nine, one more!

32:53.350 --> 32:56.139
- I'm getting nervous!
- It's nine out of nine.

32:56.309 --> 32:59.022
- I understand, I can count.
- I mean, {\it's just }one more and we're good.

32:59.905 --> 33:01.644
- Pick your legs up this time.
- Yes, sir.

33:04.675 --> 33:05.675
Set, hut!

33:23.930 --> 33:24.930
Come on.

33:27.882 --> 33:29.366
That was a piss-poor pass.

33:29.745 --> 33:30.840
I'll think about it.

33:31.897 --> 33:33.009
Let's go eat.

33:33.542 --> 33:34.801
It's cold now.

33:37.975 --> 33:40.564
- Have we got aspirin in the house?
- Sure we do.

33:40.689 --> 33:42.894
Your arm?
You haven't thrown like that in years.

33:44.236 --> 33:46.773
- He'll think about it...
- So me being you girlfriend,

33:46.898 --> 33:50.295
does that entitle me to 10%
of all your future earnings?

33:51.918 --> 33:55.448
I think it should! We should start
like a contract or something right now.

34:28.206 --> 34:30.513
- What's all this?
- I'm going with you.

34:30.855 --> 34:31.855
Really?

34:32.315 --> 34:33.585
Oh, my god!

34:37.869 --> 34:39.033
What about school?

34:39.405 --> 34:40.592
What about it? Let's go!

34:40.717 --> 34:43.286
- Before I change my mind.
- Let's go then, let's go!

34:43.905 --> 34:45.847
- You're sure about this?
- Yeah, let's go.

34:45.972 --> 34:47.321
OK, let's go.

35:10.293 --> 35:11.983
- God! Come on now!
- Honey...

35:12.331 --> 35:14.849
I can't stop thinking
about the house.

35:15.582 --> 35:18.416
- What?
- I can't stop thinking about the house.

35:18.656 --> 35:20.744
And I just don't like
the way we've gone into it

35:20.869 --> 35:23.069
and I probably
handled it wrong but...

35:23.194 --> 35:25.788
I just feel like this is something
that we need to do together,

35:26.559 --> 35:30.555
and it's an opportunity for us
as a couple and as a family...

35:32.154 --> 35:34.028
Can we just do...
Can we do something together?

35:34.153 --> 35:37.852
Can we just go back and
look at that house one more time?

35:38.296 --> 35:41.929
And say that we're going back there...
as partners,

35:42.287 --> 35:45.061
and look at it together,
and think about it together.

35:45.181 --> 35:47.468
Think about what we want
for our family and...

35:47.593 --> 35:51.309
what we want for our lives,
for our finances and all that, together.

35:59.832 --> 36:01.710
- Can I turn the light off?
- I'll set it up...

36:01.835 --> 36:04.373
- Can I turn the light off?
- Yeah, go ahead.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.856
- So this is all original woodwork,
- I know...

36:14.981 --> 36:18.089
and granite tops,
they last for a lifetime.

36:18.214 --> 36:20.635
Right? And have you seen
the view from the master?

36:23.062 --> 36:24.750
And I checked with the owner,

36:24.875 --> 36:27.024
yes, the appliances
are all included in the house.

36:27.144 --> 36:30.023
- I know you had mentioned that{\, which is worth}...
- You're {\so }lucky to be{\ good} friends with Katie,

36:30.148 --> 36:32.336
You are the first people
to have the opportunity{\ to look at this house}...

36:32.461 --> 36:34.649
Could you give us a second
just to talk this over?

36:34.878 --> 36:36.776
- Absolutely!
- Just a little breathing room...

36:36.946 --> 36:39.186
No problem, my pleasure,
I'll just be right outside.

36:39.311 --> 36:40.311
Thank you.

36:44.815 --> 36:45.928
God, she talks a lot!

36:46.048 --> 36:48.420
I know, don't let her
turn you off to the whole thing.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.741
Pretty great, right?

37:29.956 --> 37:32.291
Honey, as much as I would love...

37:33.870 --> 37:35.880
love... to give this to you,

37:37.232 --> 37:40.844
and to the kids, and to myself,
it's a beautiful house,

37:41.355 --> 37:42.785
no doubt about it.

37:46.143 --> 37:47.743
We cannot do this.

37:52.527 --> 37:54.094
It is a lot!

37:57.583 --> 37:59.567
If we ended up getting this,

38:00.451 --> 38:03.652
I would go crazy,
I would not sleep at night.

38:04.958 --> 38:06.180
Financially?

38:14.547 --> 38:15.900
We cannot do this.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.544
I am sorry.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.767
I don't need this house.

38:38.710 --> 38:39.710
I don't.

38:40.848 --> 38:42.953
I got you and I got Jules,

38:43.078 --> 38:46.093
and I got Gracie Belle,
and I got the best life.

38:46.772 --> 38:48.570
And I don't need this house.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.897
But I appreciate your coming
and looking, and being honest with me{\, and}...

38:58.022 --> 39:01.943
That was all I cared about, just...
Whatever we do, we're doing it together.

39:09.385 --> 39:10.658
I love you, baby.

39:11.642 --> 39:12.898
I love you too.

39:18.545 --> 39:20.342
- Oh, God...
- Excuse me.

39:20.462 --> 39:22.566
You know,
I have the sweetest little...

39:22.892 --> 39:25.184
three-bedroom, it's so cozy...

39:25.309 --> 39:26.879
Listen you have been so sweet,

39:27.004 --> 39:30.185
but I think we are officially not really
in the market right now.

39:30.310 --> 39:31.909
So thank you for all your time.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.565
Thank you very much,
thanks for showing us.

39:34.690 --> 39:37.244
I appreciate it. Thanks
for giving us your time.

39:42.201 --> 39:44.476
So I got this job, and I...

39:45.138 --> 39:48.807
I need to find a place to live,
and I'd prefer for that to be with you,

39:49.629 --> 39:50.859
and Noah...

39:52.409 --> 39:53.902
if you'll have me.

39:54.072 --> 39:56.250
No, that sounds... terrible.

39:56.852 --> 39:57.852
If, er...

39:58.298 --> 40:00.860
I'd prefer for that
to be with you and Noah if...

40:01.142 --> 40:03.024
If that's OK... with you...

40:03.516 --> 40:04.608
Jason, I'm pregnant.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.410
- What?
- I was being...

40:09.318 --> 40:11.106
- your gal.
- God, Riggs!

40:11.660 --> 40:13.665
What if she throws you
a curve ball like that{\, what are you gonna say}?

40:13.896 --> 40:16.978
What, like she's pregnant?
I could roll with that.

40:24.701 --> 40:25.723
Good job!

40:27.828 --> 40:30.919
{\Now, }Buddy already knows this, but when Wade,
there, was throwing the rock for Tech,

40:31.044 --> 40:33.262
he was runner-up for the Heisman
two years in a row.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.042
Let's do that again!

40:36.257 --> 40:38.760
Matt! Go in for Kendell
for wide receiver.

40:39.669 --> 40:40.669
Let's go!

40:41.366 --> 40:43.606
J.D., give him something
to work with.

40:45.551 --> 40:48.248
- Make them work for their money{\, let's go}!
- Blue, 80!

40:48.937 --> 40:50.253
Blue, 80!

40:50.939 --> 40:51.939
Set!

40:53.442 --> 40:54.717
Come on, come on!

40:57.543 --> 40:59.785
That's what I was
talking about, Wade!

41:01.643 --> 41:04.031
Rock and roll, baby!

41:08.718 --> 41:10.499
That's it right there!

41:36.277 --> 41:38.178
It's a nice neighborhood, man.

41:46.365 --> 41:47.365
You got it?

41:47.976 --> 41:48.976
Yeah.

41:54.594 --> 41:55.594
Hey, J-6...

42:03.019 --> 42:04.881
I hope you get everything...

42:06.473 --> 42:08.361
I hope you get everything you want.

42:10.776 --> 42:13.457
But no matter what happens
in there, you're...

42:15.273 --> 42:17.199
you're always gonna be
my best friend.

42:17.956 --> 42:19.893
And you deserve to be happy.

42:22.237 --> 42:23.237
Thank you.

42:39.993 --> 42:41.260
Texas forever?

42:46.222 --> 42:47.229
Texas forever.

42:50.728 --> 42:51.728
All right.

43:14.645 --> 43:16.595
What the heck are you doing here?

43:19.446 --> 43:20.446
I was...

43:22.171 --> 43:23.557
Do you mind if I hold him?

43:24.509 --> 43:25.961
Yeah, all right.

43:26.518 --> 43:28.903
- Here's your daddy, sweetheart.
- Hello, little man.

43:29.081 --> 43:30.491
Here's your daddy.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.278
Hey, you!

43:36.365 --> 43:37.985
You remember me, right?

43:40.381 --> 43:43.369
Erin, I made some serious changes
in my life in the last couple of weeks.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.298
I just got a job in the city.
In Manhattan.

43:47.935 --> 43:50.145
It's just an entry
level position but...

43:50.352 --> 43:52.720
I have my foot pretty solidly
in the door of a...

43:52.955 --> 43:55.551
pretty great sports agency.
And I'm...

43:56.619 --> 43:58.531
I'm gonna be making
about $40,000 a year,

43:58.656 --> 44:01.262
which I hear isn't much around
this neck of the woods, but...

44:02.311 --> 44:03.311
I just...

44:04.245 --> 44:06.759
I want you to be able
to take some time off and...

44:07.210 --> 44:09.141
just be with Noah and be home.

44:13.285 --> 44:16.209
And I'm gonna find a place to live,
and I would...

44:17.985 --> 44:20.782
I would really like that to be
with you and Noah...

44:23.146 --> 44:26.071
if that's what you want.
If that's not what you want,

44:26.626 --> 44:28.386
I'm still gonna find
a place close to here.

44:28.511 --> 44:32.447
{\You know, }Far enough away, I won't be a stalker
or anything, but close enough that...

44:33.928 --> 44:35.874
Close enough that I can be here.

44:37.418 --> 44:39.184
For you and for him, 'cause...

44:39.935 --> 44:42.367
I'm never gonna let
this baby down, ever.

44:46.181 --> 44:47.433
Jason...

44:51.366 --> 44:52.633
I've missed you.

44:53.092 --> 44:54.598
I've missed you so much.

44:55.771 --> 44:58.576
- I missed you too.
- Sweetheart, it's all good.

46:00.425 --> 46:03.842
All right, listen up! It's the playoffs,
gentlemen. This is where the fun begins.

46:04.012 --> 46:07.461
For those of you who've been out here
before, you know what I'm talking about.

46:07.735 --> 46:09.181
For those of you who haven't...

46:09.658 --> 46:10.766
you will.

46:14.147 --> 46:15.400
Get out of my car.

46:16.859 --> 46:20.025
- Seriously?
- This is not a joke. Get out of my car.

46:21.947 --> 46:23.445
Mrs. Taylor?
It's Tyra.

46:23.936 --> 46:25.698
I'm in a little bit of trouble.
