WEBVTT

00:04.103 --> 00:05.689
Raced to the swiss alps.

00:05.724 --> 00:07.344
 what a day.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.896
A u-turn plan targeted
Nicole and victor.

00:09.931 --> 00:11.896
 colin and scriss at this are
The strongest team -- and

00:11.931 --> 00:13.793
Christie are the strongest
Team.

00:13.827 --> 00:17.000
 we are in an alliance.
Why would we want to get rid of

00:17.034 --> 00:20.482
A team
nicole's plan backfired.

00:20.517 --> 00:25.517
 your brand is watching.

00:25.551 --> 00:26.655
 the o'reilly sisters.

00:26.689 --> 00:28.379
They like to stir the pot.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.068
 I thought raval was a friend
Of mine.

00:30.103 --> 00:32.965
I thought we could druft them
And now they will backstab us.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.724
An adventurous leg full
Of thrills.

00:36.758 --> 00:40.206
-  woo hoo!
- Ended in another victory

00:40.241 --> 00:41.068
For tyler and korey.

00:41.103 --> 00:44.344
-  first place.
- Congratulations.

00:44.379 --> 00:46.689
Meanwhile, a tense
Confrontation at the mat --

00:46.724 --> 00:49.137
 we never -- thank you so
Much for --

00:49.172 --> 00:51.137
 I'm not saying --
 so much.

00:51.172 --> 00:53.620
 this is not even --
 and we're not playing "Big

00:53.655 --> 00:55.379
- Brother."
- Ended with good news for

00:55.413 --> 00:56.137
Nicole and victor.

00:56.172 --> 00:58.310
 this is a nonelimination
Leg.

00:58.344 --> 00:59.758
 yes!
Yes.

00:59.793 --> 01:03.000
Seven teams remain.
Who will be eliminated next?

01:03.034 --> 01:12.655
 this is amazing.
Best day of my life.

01:12.689 --> 01:14.586
 all right.
 okey-dokey.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.068
 where are we going?

01:16.103 --> 01:18.034
 drive to balinberg.

01:18.068 --> 01:21.620
Once there make your way to
Spimehall and wait further

01:21.655 --> 01:22.827
- Instructions.
- Tiler and korey will be

01:22.862 --> 01:26.344
The first to leave
Michaelskirche and drive to the

01:26.379 --> 01:30.310
Village of balenberg where
Teams will find their first

01:30.344 --> 01:31.689
Clue.
 go.

01:31.724 --> 01:34.620
 we're starting this leg with
Our second first place win.

01:34.655 --> 01:36.413
 I think we have to take the
Same car.

01:36.448 --> 01:38.034
 we know we're leading the
Pack today.

01:38.068 --> 01:39.655
So we're feeling good about leg
Eight.

01:39.689 --> 01:41.862
 there's that map in the
Airport in the back.

01:41.896 --> 01:45.448
 we don't get distracted by
Drama between the other teams

01:45.482 --> 01:49.689
And whether an upcoming u-turn
Board or people hating each

01:49.724 --> 01:50.724
Other.

01:50.758 --> 01:52.413
And it lets us focus every day
We run the race.

01:52.448 --> 01:54.275
 we're the perfect team.

01:54.310 --> 01:55.551
 can you believe it?

01:55.586 --> 01:59.448
 drive to ball ballanberg.

01:59.482 --> 02:02.827
 to the cars.
To the cars.

02:02.862 --> 02:04.551
 follow each other?
 we'll follow you.

02:04.586 --> 02:05.896
 u-turn.

02:05.931 --> 02:10.033
 goodbye.
 we left the same time as

02:10.068 --> 02:11.655
Team fun and we like those
Guys.

02:11.689 --> 02:15.310
And we are helping each other
Out.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.655
Directions.
 we're in it to win it but

02:17.689 --> 02:20.793
You get what you give.

02:20.827 --> 02:23.137
 you help somebody in a key
Situation and that's something

02:23.172 --> 02:25.793
They think about on the u-turn
Map and that happens that's

02:25.827 --> 02:26.931
Great.

02:26.965 --> 02:28.310
We're not doing it for that
Reason.

02:28.344 --> 02:30.655
That's just who we are.
 colin and christie are a

02:30.689 --> 02:31.758
Good team to pair up with.

02:31.793 --> 02:35.551
 they're great at navigating.
Much better than us.

02:35.586 --> 02:43.379
So why don't we follow you?
 am I droofing or you?

02:43.413 --> 02:47.482
 so I held the record
Officially today.

02:47.517 --> 02:49.241
For 32 legs of "The amazing
Race."

02:49.275 --> 02:50.310
 here we go.

02:50.344 --> 02:54.000
 the most legs ever run on
"The amazing race."

02:54.034 --> 02:55.517
 I would like to thank phil.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.206
I would like to thank all the
Fans who cheered us along the

02:58.241 --> 02:59.413
Way.

02:59.448 --> 03:02.310
 and all of the racers that
You beat out along the way.

03:02.344 --> 03:04.310
 and interlachen to the
Right, right?

03:04.344 --> 03:05.517
 go straight.
 straight?

03:05.551 --> 03:06.068
 yeah.

03:06.103 --> 03:06.758
 straight.

03:06.793 --> 03:07.931
 no left.
 are you sure?

03:07.965 --> 03:09.586
 yes.
 today is my leg.

03:09.620 --> 03:13.931
I have good feelings.
And we have some sketchy legs

03:13.965 --> 03:14.862
The past few legs.

03:14.896 --> 03:17.275
 chris, let's go to
Ballenburg.

03:17.310 --> 03:21.034
 last leg we had all kinds of
Drama with victor and nicole.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.034
And the o'reilly sisters.
And whether they were telling

03:24.068 --> 03:26.034
The truth or not telling the
Truth.

03:26.068 --> 03:27.379
And who's possibly lying about
It.

03:27.413 --> 03:28.793
 all right.
Let's go.

03:28.827 --> 03:31.000
 leaving in last place does
Not feel great.

03:31.034 --> 03:34.551
But I'm confident we can bounce
Back from last place, and still

03:34.586 --> 03:35.379
Stay in this race.

03:35.413 --> 03:36.827
 hopefully an equalizer.

03:36.862 --> 03:41.034
 last leg a little bit of a
Drama with the reilly sisters

03:41.068 --> 03:44.206
But no reason to bring it up
Further because it will stress

03:44.241 --> 03:46.137
Us out and cause more drama
That's not supposed to be

03:46.172 --> 03:46.551
There.

03:46.586 --> 03:47.931
 we're here.

03:47.965 --> 03:49.931
My god.
 here's the marked parking.

03:49.965 --> 03:54.931
 to the marked entrance to
The ballenburg gate.

03:54.965 --> 03:58.482
 it opens up.
 an equalizer.

03:58.517 --> 03:59.758
 7:00 a.M.

03:59.793 --> 04:03.137
We're the first ones here but
It doesn't open until 7:00 a.M.

04:03.172 --> 04:05.172
 kidding.
 an omen.

04:05.206 --> 04:07.034
 come here.
Hi.

04:07.068 --> 04:08.413
 hello.
 hi.

04:08.448 --> 04:09.000
 yeah.

04:09.034 --> 04:10.103
 can't believe it.

04:10.137 --> 04:11.068
We made its way.

04:11.103 --> 04:14.517
 leo is going to die.
 leo, get the cat.

04:14.551 --> 04:17.862
Get the cat, get the cat.
 kitty!

04:17.896 --> 04:21.654
My god.
My god!

04:21.689 --> 04:25.551
 and never seen him this
Excited.

04:25.586 --> 04:29.137
 this is ballan.

04:29.172 --> 04:30.344
-- ballenburg.

04:30.379 --> 04:31.931
 come on.
Let's go.

04:31.965 --> 04:35.620
 we have some relationships
To repair with the afghanimals.

04:35.655 --> 04:38.413
And we're hoping we can get to
Them and repair this

04:38.448 --> 04:42.103
Relationship immediately before
Anybody gets the u-turn.

04:42.137 --> 04:43.517
 hey --
 hi.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.586
 hey.
 can we talk to you?

04:45.620 --> 04:46.275
 yeah.

04:46.310 --> 04:47.551
 sure.

04:47.586 --> 04:50.793
 so we just want to clear the
Air because I think that they

04:50.827 --> 04:52.931
-- there was some confusion
About nicole and victor saying

04:52.965 --> 04:55.827
That we said your names about
Something with the u-turn.

04:55.862 --> 05:00.137
 used to this being excluded.
By the o'reillies.

05:00.172 --> 05:02.655
 we should never talk to
Nicole to begin with.

05:02.689 --> 05:06.620
 and I don't have an
Instagram followers.

05:06.655 --> 05:10.379
 nicole came to us because we
Made the big brother pact.

05:10.413 --> 05:13.103
 and I didn't say one word
And this was all rachel talking

05:13.137 --> 05:14.379
To nicole.

05:14.413 --> 05:16.896
 I said you guys should watch
Out because I heard that you

05:16.931 --> 05:22.034
Are in danger of getting urned.
-- u-turned.

05:22.068 --> 05:24.137
 clearly.
It was too much to say.

05:24.172 --> 05:25.827
 right.
 but we would never do that

05:25.862 --> 05:27.034
To you guys.

05:27.068 --> 05:29.172
And we did have an alliance
With the "Big brother" teams.

05:29.206 --> 05:30.000
Which is done.

05:30.034 --> 05:31.896
 what happened?
 literally done.

05:31.931 --> 05:34.517
 I was kind of disappointed
From what I heard, rachel.

05:34.551 --> 05:35.586
 we were disappointed.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.310
 we're over here calling you
Guys our sisters.

05:38.344 --> 05:40.448
 but agree --
 we go back.

05:40.482 --> 05:43.172
With rachel and elissa I was
Disappointed to hear that but

05:43.206 --> 05:46.172
She swore that she didn't say
-- she's playing two sides of

05:46.206 --> 05:47.172
The story.

05:47.206 --> 05:49.482
Which didn't really rub the
Right way off me.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.034
So, I mean, people make
Mistakes.

05:51.068 --> 05:55.241
 I just want to let you guys
Know that personal friends,

05:55.275 --> 05:57.275
Like I -- I love you guys.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.068
 and didn't rub me the right
Way, either.

05:59.103 --> 06:00.655
But I'm not one to hold
Grudges.

06:00.689 --> 06:03.241
 we're going to prove to you
Guys that we are trustworthy.

06:03.275 --> 06:06.448
 rhett me give you an -- let
Me give you an instance.

06:06.482 --> 06:08.689
You're in fifth and you have
Rachel behind us and team

06:08.724 --> 06:10.103
Bromance who are you going to
U-turn?

06:10.137 --> 06:13.862
 rachel and elissa.
 so it has changed a little.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.655
 I messed up.
 it's all good.

06:15.689 --> 06:16.482
It's all good.

06:16.517 --> 06:17.103
 ok.

06:17.137 --> 06:18.172
 too much drama.

06:18.206 --> 06:20.137
 switzerland.
 good to be switzerland.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.758
 neutral.
 good to be switzerland.

06:21.793 --> 06:24.000
In switzerland.
 there was a cat here by the

06:24.034 --> 06:26.551
Way.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:37.586 --> 06:39.172
 come on.
Let's go, let's go.

06:39.206 --> 06:40.517
 let's go, let's go.

06:40.551 --> 06:43.206
Come on, jamal.
 come on, rach.

06:43.241 --> 06:51.758
 let's go.

06:51.793 --> 06:52.758
Go inside.

06:52.793 --> 06:55.793
 what is going on here?
 this is not good.

06:55.827 --> 06:58.241
 seeing phil means that it's
Got to be something crazy,

06:58.275 --> 07:03.034
Something that's going to shake
Up the race.

07:03.068 --> 07:04.103
Ok.
Good morning.

07:04.137 --> 07:05.137
 good morning!

07:05.172 --> 07:08.482
Welcome to the ballenberg
Community hole.

07:08.517 --> 07:11.655
Switzerland is a country where
Everybody gets to vote.

07:11.689 --> 07:12.965
 democracy.
 yes.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.379
This is a country that believes
It has the oldest democracy in

07:16.413 --> 07:17.275
The world.

07:17.310 --> 07:19.206
-  wow.
- So it seems only fitting

07:19.241 --> 07:26.000
That as we begin this next leg
Of the race, we have a u-turn

07:26.034 --> 07:30.620
Vote.
 is this out loud?

07:30.655 --> 07:31.896
Ness out loud.
 what?

07:31.931 --> 07:37.931
This is in front of each
Other.

07:45.241 --> 07:46.448
National captioning institute,

07:46.482 --> 07:47.689
Which is responsible for its
Caption content and accuracy.

08:25.724 --> 08:30.241
Switzerland is a country
Where everybody gets to vote.

08:30.275 --> 08:34.931
It seems only fitting we have a
U-turn vote.

08:34.965 --> 08:36.758
-  wow.
- This is out loud.

08:36.793 --> 08:37.620
 what?

08:37.655 --> 08:39.379
This is in front of each
Other.

08:39.413 --> 08:42.965
Every team gets a vote.
And we're going to vote until

08:43.000 --> 08:46.275
We determine the two teams that
Have to complete both sides of

08:46.310 --> 08:48.517
The detour.
 two teams.

08:48.551 --> 08:48.931
Yes.

08:48.965 --> 08:51.034
Two teams.

08:51.068 --> 08:53.931
 first time in "The amazing
Race" history, not only are you

08:53.965 --> 08:56.827
Voting for who to u-turn but
Publicly announcing who you

08:56.862 --> 08:59.034
Just u-turned.

08:59.068 --> 09:00.172
Exactly.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.551
And nare right there next to
You so they can see you.

09:02.586 --> 09:03.413
My goodness.

09:03.448 --> 09:05.000
We're about to vote live right
Here.

09:05.034 --> 09:07.000
 and we've all been expecting
This u-turn.

09:07.034 --> 09:10.965
 in "Survivor" that's what --
They had a travel counsel and

09:11.000 --> 09:12.965
Called it a live tribal.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.310
Think very carefully
About this vote because there

09:15.344 --> 09:19.931
Are no more nonelimination legs
Left in the race.

09:19.965 --> 09:22.241
 I felt like people were
Either going to vote

09:22.275 --> 09:25.103
Strategically for the strongest
Team or against the team that

09:25.137 --> 09:27.793
They hated.
 don't waste it on us.

09:27.827 --> 09:32.034
 not since 2016 has there
Been such a big vote.

09:32.068 --> 09:36.137
We did a random draw for
The order in which you vote.

09:36.172 --> 09:39.241
 oshese, my god.

09:39.275 --> 09:42.172
Rachel and elissa you get

09:42.206 --> 09:44.275
To vote and who you get to vote
For.

09:44.310 --> 09:47.379
 the whole drama going on
We'll see where everyone stands

09:47.413 --> 09:48.517
With it.

09:48.551 --> 09:51.206
If they want to get us out.
A speed bump and a u-turn.

09:51.241 --> 09:55.344
That's an easy way to just, you
Know, adios.

09:55.379 --> 09:59.275
 this is 1,000 percent game
Related.

09:59.310 --> 10:03.103
Colin and christie.
I'm so sorry.

10:03.137 --> 10:05.103
One vote, colin and
Christie.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.586
Nicole and victor.

10:06.620 --> 10:08.000
Time for you to make a vote.

10:08.034 --> 10:12.896
 what are you going to do?

10:12.931 --> 10:14.689
-  what do you think?
- Think very carefully

10:14.724 --> 10:15.379
About this vote.

10:15.413 --> 10:16.379
 I don't know.

10:16.413 --> 10:17.758
I don't know what to do.

10:17.793 --> 10:20.862
 just whatever --
 so this is strictly a

10:20.896 --> 10:21.793
Strategy move.

10:21.827 --> 10:24.310
No emotions involved.
Sorry, afghanimals.

10:24.344 --> 10:37.896
You guys are a strong team.
 I literally -- what to do.

10:37.931 --> 10:41.000
 and you said you don't know.
 no.

10:41.034 --> 10:43.344
I --
 what to do.

10:43.379 --> 10:46.931
 we're the u-turn team.
It's all good.

10:46.965 --> 10:50.137
Colin and christie, it's
Your vote.

10:50.172 --> 10:52.862
 you know, we'll just keep it
Even.

10:52.896 --> 10:53.586
Rachel and elissa.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.931
Leo and jamal.

10:54.965 --> 10:57.965
 colin and christie, we love
You but we're going to u-turn

10:58.000 --> 11:00.620
- You guys.
- We want teams that we can

11:00.655 --> 11:02.758
 we want teams that we can

11:02.793 --> 11:04.827
- Beat.
- Two votes for colin and

11:04.862 --> 11:06.655
Christie.
Becca and floyd, it's your

11:06.689 --> 11:08.724
Vote.
 I want more than anything to

11:08.758 --> 11:11.827
Win "The amazing race" and I
Don't know if I can with colin

11:11.862 --> 11:14.344
And christie still in the game.
So --

11:14.379 --> 11:15.482
 no hard feelings.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.034
 colin and christie.

11:17.068 --> 11:20.758
 that's when I knew, ok,
Definitely we are one of the

11:20.793 --> 11:22.034
Teams.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.551
It was just a matter of who are
We going to be doing this up

11:24.586 --> 11:25.724
Against?

11:25.758 --> 11:27.551
- And when do we get started?
- Tyler and korey your

11:27.586 --> 11:29.724
Vote.
 we love this team a lot.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.586
They got last on this last leg
So we're just going to vote for

11:32.620 --> 11:33.862
Nicole and victor.

11:33.896 --> 11:36.827
-  nicole and victor.
- One vote left.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.655
Colin and christie, you have
Three votes.

11:39.689 --> 11:43.413
Leo and jamal, colin and
Victor, and rachel and elissa.

11:43.448 --> 11:44.689
You have one vote.

11:44.724 --> 11:51.068
So this is a big vote for you,
Chris and bret.

11:51.103 --> 11:54.896
 we're going to base our vote
On who we're least close west

11:54.931 --> 11:56.379
And that's the reilly sisters.

11:56.413 --> 12:01.103
 you guys are making us go
Against colen and christie?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.413
Ok.
 we formed tight

12:02.448 --> 12:03.448
Relationships with people.

12:03.482 --> 12:05.413
And I couldn't swing a vote for
The others.

12:05.448 --> 12:06.965
I just couldn't.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.103
The after --
 the afghanimals have been

12:10.137 --> 12:12.310
Friendly with us since day one
And victor and nicole talking

12:12.344 --> 12:16.206
With us and I couldn't tell you
Anything about the o'reillys

12:16.241 --> 12:17.689
But long -- orioles and have
Long eyelashes and want to fix

12:17.724 --> 12:19.344
Them every five minutes.

12:19.379 --> 12:20.827
 that's not smart.

12:20.862 --> 12:23.172
 it's $1 million, guys.
You aren't a strong team,

12:23.206 --> 12:27.931
Either.
 it was -- I thought we were

12:27.965 --> 12:33.413
Racing for -- chris and bret
Can't outrun they team and

12:33.448 --> 12:34.965
Clearly not more intelligent
Than the other teams.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.793
 right.
So I would make a decision

12:37.827 --> 12:41.482
Based on you who think you have
A better chance at beating for

12:41.517 --> 12:45.068
$1 million.
 that was $1 million, guys.

12:45.103 --> 12:48.896
The vote is done.
We have two teams that have

12:48.931 --> 12:50.172
Been u-turned.

12:50.206 --> 12:55.482
Colen and christie and rachel
And elissa, is everybody ready

12:55.517 --> 12:56.448
To race?

12:56.482 --> 12:57.862
Good luck.

12:57.896 --> 12:59.068
Travel safe.

12:59.103 --> 13:00.241
Go!
 go, go.

13:00.275 --> 13:01.034
 here we go.

13:01.068 --> 13:01.793
 let's go.

13:01.827 --> 13:03.034
 you got it.

13:03.068 --> 13:06.517
 just grab one, bret.
 and hay --

13:06.551 --> 13:09.793
This detour requires
Teams to make hay while the sun

13:09.827 --> 13:12.310
Shines.
Something swiss farmers do

13:12.344 --> 13:16.103
Every summer to ensure that
Their animals can survive the

13:16.137 --> 13:20.965
Long, cold winters.
Using an old style sythe like

13:21.000 --> 13:23.551
Sardinha a swiss under 16
Champion, one team member must

13:23.586 --> 13:27.172
Cut a lane of grass while the
Other rakes up behind them.

13:27.206 --> 13:30.103
When the grass has been
Properly stacked, they will be

13:30.137 --> 13:34.310
Rewarded with a clue.
Every year, more than 350,000

13:34.344 --> 13:37.724
Cows come down from the
Mountains to escape the cold

13:37.758 --> 13:38.655
Winter months.

13:38.689 --> 13:41.275
And are celebrated at festivals
Like this.

13:41.310 --> 13:44.344
This detour requires teams to
Dress them up and then lead

13:44.379 --> 13:48.586
Them to the party to be judged.
 hay making.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.793
 hay making.

13:50.827 --> 13:52.551
 cut grass.
 we're going to do hay

13:52.586 --> 13:57.551
Making.
 hay making or cow cow

13:57.586 --> 13:59.310
Dressing.
 we should have u-turned

13:59.344 --> 14:00.275
Victor and nicole.

14:00.310 --> 14:01.724
 especially since they had a
Speed bump.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.965
 speed bump.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.896
Having arrived last in
The previous leg, nicole and

14:04.931 --> 14:09.689
Victor must take down and fold
The 26 flags representing the

14:09.724 --> 14:12.620
26 states of switzer lnled.
Then try to catch up with the

14:12.655 --> 14:13.551
Other teams.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.758
26 legs right in here, nick.

14:15.793 --> 14:17.000
 holy crap.
We have 26?

14:17.034 --> 14:18.344
You want to get them down?

14:18.379 --> 14:20.689
 yep.
 my gosh, I can't believe you

14:20.724 --> 14:22.206
Did that.
That was bold.

14:22.241 --> 14:25.517
 he thought people were going
To vote for stronger teams.

14:25.551 --> 14:28.862
And nicole had said the
O'reilly sisters.

14:28.896 --> 14:29.965
Followed up by I don't know.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.034
 I said vote for rachel and
Elissa.

14:32.068 --> 14:33.758
 and you said you don't know
After that.

14:33.793 --> 14:37.586
 you know you made a bad
Move.

14:37.620 --> 14:39.758
 I won't respond if you argue
With me.

14:39.793 --> 14:43.551
I'll tell you that right now.
 which one is this?

14:43.586 --> 14:44.689
 cow dressing.

14:44.724 --> 14:46.137
 choose the basket.
Got it.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.103
Provide materials to make
Headdresses.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.172
 finish example.

14:49.206 --> 14:50.379
For a reference, right here.

14:50.413 --> 14:52.241
 let's do it.
 make your headdress.

14:52.275 --> 14:54.344
 do you want to take one seed
And I'll take the other?

14:54.379 --> 14:56.620
 perfect.
 chris and bret picked us to

14:56.655 --> 14:57.793
Go against colin and christie.

14:57.827 --> 15:00.655
So we have to do two detours.
 these guys aren't my

15:00.689 --> 15:01.620
Friends.

15:01.655 --> 15:04.275
 but I don't plan on getting
Eliminated.

15:04.310 --> 15:07.068
 lay off the garland.
You're just looking at this and

15:07.103 --> 15:09.482
Trying to replicate it.
 I think colin and christie

15:09.517 --> 15:10.310
Like us.

15:10.344 --> 15:10.862
Right, guys?

15:10.896 --> 15:12.103
 we like you guys.

15:12.137 --> 15:14.034
 we love you.
 we like you guys.

15:14.068 --> 15:17.793
 we like you guys, too.
We wouldn't wouldn't have

15:17.827 --> 15:21.448
U-turned you guys if it were
Not a nonoption.

15:21.482 --> 15:24.034
 I understand that people are
Doing what they've got to do to

15:24.068 --> 15:26.724
Stay in the race.
And if they feel like that is

15:26.758 --> 15:29.310
Taking us out, I can respect
That.

15:29.344 --> 15:32.068
But obviously we got to do what
We got to do because we want to

15:32.103 --> 15:32.896
Stay in this race.

15:32.931 --> 15:34.586
We're in it to win it.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.551
 you got this, rach.

15:38.586 --> 15:40.172
 here we go.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.034
 it's not like you to not
Want to put a headdress on a

15:43.068 --> 15:43.862
Cow.

15:43.896 --> 15:45.413
 thank you for not u-turning
Us.

15:45.448 --> 15:48.482
We knew everybody us else but
Them.

15:48.517 --> 15:50.896
 we voted with our heart and
Maybe not with our head.

15:50.931 --> 15:54.344
 it could bite us but I feel
Right now pretty good about the

15:54.379 --> 15:56.068
Vote.
 this is it.

15:56.103 --> 16:01.931
This is it.
 the other ranks may switch

16:01.965 --> 16:03.241
At any time.

16:03.275 --> 16:08.137
 and the -- be at the end of
Your lane.

16:08.172 --> 16:10.827
 hay with them.
Hand-held cutting tool.

16:10.862 --> 16:11.793
Rake it.

16:11.827 --> 16:15.482
Stack it.
That's us.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.551
 this is the right choice,
Ty.

16:17.586 --> 16:21.000
 back at the office here.
 good job, leo.

16:21.034 --> 16:21.655
You're cutting it.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.551
You're shaving it.

16:22.586 --> 16:24.206
Good job.
 you can't rake until I get

16:24.241 --> 16:25.448
 ok.

16:25.482 --> 16:26.793
 beautiful day in
Switzerland.

16:26.827 --> 16:30.068
Trying to work away the
Emotional u-turn.

16:30.103 --> 16:30.896
That sucked.

16:30.931 --> 16:32.827
 becca is crushing that.

16:32.862 --> 16:35.448
 becca has got this and a
Farm girl.

16:35.482 --> 16:41.965
Start raking, girl.
 old mcbecca had a farm.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.586
E-I, e-I, o!

16:44.620 --> 16:46.793
 this will take some time.

16:46.827 --> 16:49.137
 I'm -- the way I saw it,
They already hate us.

16:49.172 --> 16:51.034
So why make another team hate
Us?

16:51.068 --> 16:52.931
You know what I mean?
 you're right.

16:52.965 --> 16:55.000
 I would say that's our
Biggest communication error and

16:55.034 --> 16:58.724
It happened at the craziest
Time.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.000
 fold in half twice.

17:00.034 --> 17:01.620
 and half one more time.

17:01.655 --> 17:02.448
 we bounce back.

17:02.482 --> 17:03.758
We're a real couple.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.413
We can get stressed and we can
Get tense but at the end of the

17:06.448 --> 17:08.205
Race all that is by the
Wayside.

17:08.241 --> 17:10.034
We love each other.
That's just what we had to do

17:10.068 --> 17:15.723
To get to where we are now.
 good thing we didn't get

17:15.758 --> 17:18.517
U-turned plus the speed bump.
 what you did do with all the

17:18.550 --> 17:19.655
Pens?
 they're --

17:19.689 --> 17:22.000
 you have to be very careful.
 rach, we got this.

17:22.034 --> 17:24.275
 we're fighting against
Nicole and victor because they

17:24.310 --> 17:26.655
Had a speed bump.
But our -- our really big

17:26.689 --> 17:29.103
Competition is colin and
Christie because we're double

17:29.137 --> 17:30.137
Urnlted with them.

17:30.172 --> 17:32.034
 rachel, you're so good at
This stuff.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.827
 we have to duplicate the
Flour arrangement.

17:33.862 --> 17:34.827
 it looks amazing.

17:34.862 --> 17:35.413
 ok.

17:35.448 --> 17:36.586
Go.
 they just left.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.620
 and then our flower
Arrangement was a head piece

17:38.655 --> 17:42.034
That our cow would wear and go
To the dance festival.

17:42.068 --> 17:45.517
 a lot more of those little
Ring things.

17:45.551 --> 17:47.137
 what's your name?

17:47.172 --> 17:47.862
 oliver.

17:47.896 --> 17:49.137
 oliver.

17:49.172 --> 17:51.793
 don't put the pins in yet.
Lay out the flowers and pin it

17:51.827 --> 17:53.965
All together.
 listen, I'm doing the best I

17:54.000 --> 17:55.034
Can, ok?

17:55.068 --> 17:58.620

 I'm going to start raking.

17:58.655 --> 18:00.413

18:00.448 --> 18:02.965

If you get tired, let me know.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.310
 good job, ty.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.758
 the technique is get her
Done.

18:06.793 --> 18:09.241
 if there was a technique I
Did not have it.

18:09.275 --> 18:11.586
I think if you want to know
What the technique was ask

18:11.620 --> 18:16.724
Becca because we looked over at
Other and she looked as happy

18:16.758 --> 18:18.620
As a clam.

18:18.655 --> 18:21.034
 just doing this.
And giggling away.

18:21.068 --> 18:22.103
Having her life.

18:22.137 --> 18:30.448
 and on that farm I had a s
Ythe, e-I, e-I-o.

18:30.482 --> 18:35.206
 and I'm I'm sweating and
Divis gusting -- I wouldn't be

18:35.241 --> 18:42.793
Surprised if she's like spent a
Summer doing hay making.

18:42.827 --> 18:45.137
 landscaping.
That was my job and removed

18:45.172 --> 18:48.586
Many a we had but never a with
A scy.

18:48.620 --> 18:57.034
 this is another day at the
Office for me.

 all right.
 oliver.

19:10.586 --> 19:11.586
It's ok.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.931
 we had a little jump on
Colin and christie.

19:13.965 --> 19:17.068
But we had to take our cow on a
Walk to a festival.

19:17.103 --> 19:17.896
Oliver, come on.

19:17.931 --> 19:19.758
But she wasn't having it.

19:19.793 --> 19:20.517
 here we go.

19:20.551 --> 19:22.620
 come on.
 oliver.

19:22.655 --> 19:28.103
We're almost there, oliver.
Ok.

19:28.137 --> 19:30.206
Choose a basket of flowers and
Tools.

19:30.241 --> 19:35.137
Once chosen you may not switch.
Mark finished example.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.551
 you start making this thing
And I'll make -- I'll make the

19:37.586 --> 19:38.379
Stand.

19:38.413 --> 19:39.413
 do we have every flower in
There?

19:39.448 --> 19:40.793
We don't have this flower in
There.

19:40.827 --> 19:42.034
Lay it down.

19:42.068 --> 19:46.413
 they grab that stuff at --
 we need a couple of these.

19:46.448 --> 19:49.068
 put them short like that
Because I have to stick them

19:49.103 --> 19:51.034
In.
 let's go.

19:51.068 --> 19:53.655
 that looks not half bad.
 it has to be more organic

19:53.689 --> 19:54.517
Than that.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.655
 the whole thing --
 let me stop.

19:56.689 --> 19:57.758
 you go.

19:57.793 --> 20:00.482

History with bovines.

20:00.517 --> 20:03.034
 my ox is broken!
 calm down.

20:03.068 --> 20:07.000
 so it was very important to
Christie to pick out the cow.

20:07.034 --> 20:11.896
She really wanted to feel in
The energy of all the cows.

20:11.931 --> 20:14.517
And make sure she was able to
Really connect with one of

20:14.551 --> 20:18.551
Them.
 a little bit of tell pathic

20:18.586 --> 20:20.068
Communication -- telepathic
Communication.

20:20.103 --> 20:23.517
 threw go.

20:23.551 --> 20:25.137
-- there you go.

20:25.172 --> 20:30.413

With this little girl.

20:30.448 --> 20:31.862
 kick it in high gear.

20:31.896 --> 20:32.965
 good job.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.758
Almost there, te'o.

The thing and let's get it

 wait up.

21:16.482 --> 21:20.896
 let's work together.
 it looks like we're going to

21:20.931 --> 21:24.000
Follow tyler and korey to the
Farm --

21:24.034 --> 21:25.724
 team fun is directly behind
Us.

21:25.758 --> 21:28.689
We think we're the first two
Teams out of there.

21:28.724 --> 21:30.931
 all right.
 ok.

21:30.965 --> 21:36.275
Let's go.

 oliver, it's ok.
Come on, baby girl.

21:42.068 --> 21:46.034
 come on.
 we learned a little secret

21:46.068 --> 21:48.413
About how to control your cow.

21:48.448 --> 21:52.586
You grab its tail, and --
 come on, oliver.

21:52.620 --> 21:53.655
I found the gas pedal.

21:53.689 --> 21:54.655
 good job, rach.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.793
 thank you.
 good girl.

21:56.827 --> 22:00.931
 for the milk you give.
Oliver, you're the best.

22:00.965 --> 22:05.241
We're almost there, oliver.
We're almost there.

22:05.275 --> 22:07.379
 come on.
 it's ok.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.931
 come on.
 we were the last team

22:10.965 --> 22:12.068
Fighting for survival.

22:12.103 --> 22:16.344
 you get into an intense
Situation and it's really

22:16.379 --> 22:19.586
Heightened and competitive and
$1 million on the line.

22:19.620 --> 22:23.275
 seriously?
 damn it!

22:23.310 --> 22:24.310
 this is .

22:31.344 --> 22:35.172
 come on, seriously?

22:35.206 --> 22:37.034
 there was definitely
Thoughts of might have cow is

22:37.068 --> 22:37.724
Broken going through my -- of
My cow is broken going through

22:37.758 --> 22:45.724
My mind.

22:45.758 --> 22:46.448
 ok.

22:46.482 --> 22:51.000
 check, please.
Right here.

22:51.034 --> 22:52.793
It looks good?

22:52.827 --> 22:54.517
 yay!
 we have to do the other

22:54.551 --> 22:56.551
Detour.
 where's the clue?

22:56.586 --> 22:59.206
 we dropped our clue?
And we left it on the table?

22:59.241 --> 23:00.310
 my god.

23:00.344 --> 23:02.827
 that's fine.
 we don't need it.

23:02.862 --> 23:06.034
 let's just go to try to do
It.

23:06.068 --> 23:14.482
 can we get judged?
Thank you.

23:14.517 --> 23:15.482
Thank you.

23:15.517 --> 23:16.551
Thank you.

23:16.586 --> 23:17.724
 ok.

23:17.758 --> 23:22.068
Second part of the feature.
 good girl.

23:22.103 --> 23:24.448
You look beautiful.
 we use this string.

23:24.482 --> 23:25.655
We use the needle.

23:25.689 --> 23:29.034
 it's good.
 yeah!

23:29.068 --> 23:30.448
All right.

23:30.482 --> 23:32.448
 rach, we don't know what
We're going to do.

23:32.482 --> 23:35.344
 can I see your clue?
 yeah.

23:35.379 --> 23:37.931
I'm going to be mowing.
 and I'm supposed to pick up

23:37.965 --> 23:38.448
Grass?

23:38.482 --> 23:39.517
 yeah.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.344
 is there any way you can let
Us read your clue?

23:41.379 --> 23:42.448
 absolutely not.

23:42.482 --> 23:43.034
Sorry.

23:43.068 --> 23:43.965
 they won't.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.586
 well, we have to just do it.
All right.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.517
You're going to do that.

23:48.551 --> 23:51.413
 elissa wanted to check out
Our clue.

23:51.448 --> 23:54.275
We want help the team that's
Trying to get us out.

23:54.310 --> 23:57.172
 of course.
 my god.

23:57.206 --> 23:59.517
 we're just following
Whatever colin and christie are

23:59.551 --> 24:00.793
Doing.

24:00.827 --> 24:03.275
They're going to get past us
And it won't matter if we just

24:03.310 --> 24:08.620
Follow what they're doing.

24:08.655 --> 24:12.103
 I think --
 we're here.

24:12.137 --> 24:15.310
 tyler, the bow and
Arrow.

24:15.344 --> 24:16.758
 good job, guys.

24:16.793 --> 24:18.413
 roadblock.
 roadblock.

24:18.448 --> 24:20.000
 who wants to be a big shot?

24:20.034 --> 24:21.517
 tyler does.

24:21.551 --> 24:25.586
Legend says that 700
Years ago, swiss hero william

24:25.620 --> 24:30.206
Tell shot an apple off his
Son's head using a crossbow

24:30.241 --> 24:31.379
Like this.

24:31.413 --> 24:35.379
A risky shot that teams will
Now take to complete this

24:35.413 --> 24:38.379
Roadblock.

24:38.413 --> 24:41.206
Thankfully, if they miss,
They're only shooting at a

24:41.241 --> 24:41.896
Swiss scarecrow.

24:41.931 --> 24:43.758
 who wants to be a big shot?

24:43.793 --> 24:44.758
 wish me luck.

24:44.793 --> 24:49.620
 good luck.
 and hands you your bolts and

24:49.655 --> 24:50.896
Leads you to the target.

24:50.931 --> 24:54.517
 are you the armorers?

24:54.551 --> 24:55.724
 armorers?

24:55.758 --> 24:59.448
 who is good at shooting?
 I choose you, pokemon.

24:59.482 --> 25:00.896
 this is incredible.

25:00.931 --> 25:01.586
 choose one.

25:01.620 --> 25:02.379
 choose one.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.103
 ok.

25:03.137 --> 25:06.137
That one.
 we got to be 1-2.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.655
 chris and bret are right
Behind.

25:07.689 --> 25:10.310
 this has to be it.
 these are the teams.

25:10.344 --> 25:12.068
Receipt here.
 right up here.

25:12.103 --> 25:14.827
 that's a nice view.

25:14.862 --> 25:16.482
 the person ahead of the
Scarecrow.

25:16.517 --> 25:17.689
 pick your clue.

25:17.724 --> 25:18.551
 pick my clue.

25:18.586 --> 25:21.689
 you got it, sarge.
 come on, ty.

25:21.724 --> 25:24.517
 I hope I'm good at this.
I have to take this crossbow

25:24.551 --> 25:26.931
And shoot the apple on top of
The scarecrow.

25:26.965 --> 25:29.034
Hopefully do it before eve else
Does.

25:29.068 --> 25:31.034
 tyler is a sniper.
 is he actually?

25:31.068 --> 25:34.137
 we all know from panama and
The fishy challenge that becca

25:34.172 --> 25:38.724
Is better with bow and arrow
Than floyd.

25:41.827 --> 25:46.068
 so it was a clear choice
That target practice is a becca

25:46.103 --> 25:47.034
Challenge.

25:47.068 --> 25:49.206
 can sarge shoot a gun?
 he's a gun guy.

25:49.241 --> 25:52.482
 I'm a boston police sarge.
I'm a pretty good shot, too.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.172
But I've never shot a crossbow.
So let's all just settle down.

25:55.206 --> 25:56.275
And see how this goes.

25:56.310 --> 25:56.793
 ok.

25:56.827 --> 25:58.034
So pull that back.

25:58.068 --> 26:01.000
That just balances right there.
 thank you.

26:01.034 --> 26:01.931
 ok.

26:01.965 --> 26:04.724
Right -- tyler is taking his
First shot.

26:04.758 --> 26:05.965
 he took the head off?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.137
 higher than I think.
 and where do you think becca

26:09.172 --> 26:11.241
Is going?
!

26:11.275 --> 26:13.172
 sarge has got it.

26:13.206 --> 26:14.793
 did you see how close he
Was?

26:14.827 --> 26:15.620
 yeah.

26:15.655 --> 26:16.620
 everyone hit the face that
Time.

26:16.655 --> 26:18.655
 it might be a little harder
Than I thought.

26:18.689 --> 26:25.034
 practice makes perfect.

26:25.068 --> 26:28.172
 do not get close --
 I'm not, dude.

26:28.206 --> 26:30.827
 the reilly sisters were
Ahead of us after that first

26:30.862 --> 26:33.896
Detour but we could catch up
With a more physical mowing

26:33.931 --> 26:34.586
Challenge.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.689
 come on, rachel and elissa.

26:36.724 --> 26:37.689
 I'm right behind you.

26:37.724 --> 26:41.655
 that's good.
 I think we're almost done.

26:41.689 --> 26:44.965
 colin was -- like he's
Basically done by like we're

26:45.000 --> 26:45.965
Halfway.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.206
And ridiculous.
 I've never been so beat up

26:47.241 --> 26:52.931
In my life.
 ok.

26:52.965 --> 26:53.965
 rach.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.034
 thank you.
 congratulations.

26:58.068 --> 27:02.862
 thank you very much.
 we're almost done, rach.

27:02.896 --> 27:03.724
 here?

27:03.758 --> 27:04.862
 no.

27:04.896 --> 27:08.206
 look at these signs.
 I'm going to go over this

27:08.241 --> 27:09.310
Place.

27:09.344 --> 27:12.379
 keep going around.
 I naught this was our leg.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.689
 probably the other team has
Maps.

27:14.724 --> 27:18.724
And we didn't.

27:18.758 --> 27:20.517
 bret and becca, let's do
This.

27:20.551 --> 27:21.689
Zpwhrrvets let's do this.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.862
 let's do this.
 who are you imagining the

27:23.896 --> 27:25.655
Scarecrow is?
 I have a good one in my

27:25.689 --> 27:28.344
Head.
 I need to hit the apple,

27:28.379 --> 27:29.275
Right?

27:29.310 --> 27:34.000
 you got it, becca.
 scarecrow barbie.

27:34.034 --> 27:35.275
 my god.

27:35.310 --> 27:41.965
 keeps knocking his arms off.
 I got it.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.931
 bret got it.
 good job, bret.

27:43.965 --> 27:48.517
 good work.
 thank you.

27:48.551 --> 27:51.827
 you're the man, sarge.
 let's go.

27:51.862 --> 27:56.068
-  to your next pit stop.
- Teams must take a small

27:56.103 --> 27:58.241
Motor boat to the pit stop and
They'll find me in the

27:58.275 --> 28:02.344
Beautiful gardens of the grand
Hotel gisbach.

28:02.379 --> 28:05.448
There are no more
Noneliminations left in the

28:05.482 --> 28:07.310
Race.
So the last team to arrive here

28:07.344 --> 28:11.137
Will be eliminated.
 let's go, let's go.

28:11.172 --> 28:13.620
 go get it, boys.
 I nailed it, dude.

28:13.655 --> 28:14.551
 we're in first place.

28:14.586 --> 28:22.103
We can do it.
 come on, ty.

28:22.137 --> 28:26.034
 you monkey pooper.
Dang it.

28:26.068 --> 28:29.724
 when I took my first shot I
Hit the scarecrow in the face

28:29.758 --> 28:33.379
And I realized I had to shoot
Higher up than I ended.

28:33.413 --> 28:37.931
This challenge was trial and
Error and not adjusting how far

28:37.965 --> 28:41.034
Off you were last time you'll
Never get it.

28:41.068 --> 28:44.586
 slightly higher.
Just go higher than you think.

28:46.896 --> 28:47.758
 what a champ.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.620
 did he get it?
 I think he got it.

28:49.655 --> 28:52.724
 good job, ty.

28:52.758 --> 28:53.413
 yeah.

28:53.448 --> 28:55.482
 you're the apple of my eye.

28:55.517 --> 28:57.896
 bye.
 hey, tyler, could you see

28:57.931 --> 28:59.103
The apple in your view finder?

28:59.137 --> 29:00.517
 above it, above it.

29:00.551 --> 29:02.586
 just above it?
Ok.

29:02.620 --> 29:07.931
 hakuna matada, my friends.
 we got through that first

29:07.965 --> 29:11.137
Detour and I don't know how we
Got past the afghanimals and on

29:11.172 --> 29:15.896
The same task with us.

29:15.931 --> 29:20.034
 from first to worse and
Worst to first and first to

29:20.068 --> 29:20.586
Worst.

29:20.620 --> 29:21.482
 there's 30 minutes.

29:21.517 --> 29:25.275
 we got this, lili.
We are champions.

29:25.310 --> 29:30.034
We're fierce.
Can we get a check?

29:30.068 --> 29:33.034
Ok.
Thank you.

29:33.068 --> 29:34.000
Thank you.

 overswfment wagen.
 swede bump.

29:47.068 --> 29:51.413
 the afghanimals.
 how was your speed bump?

29:51.448 --> 29:54.034

 you're the fourth team here.

29:54.068 --> 29:55.862
 we'll take it.
 good job.

29:55.896 --> 29:58.068
 thank you.
 you beat the afghanimals.

29:58.103 --> 29:58.758
 nice.

29:58.793 --> 30:00.034
 who wants to be a big shot?

30:00.068 --> 30:03.758
 I'll be a big shot.

30:03.793 --> 30:06.620
 just come from this way?
 I think we messed up again.

30:06.655 --> 30:07.206
 dang.

30:07.241 --> 30:09.137
Did we go the wrong way?

30:09.172 --> 30:11.034
 maybe we went the wrong way
Again.

30:11.068 --> 30:12.379
 we have to go that way
Again.

30:12.413 --> 30:14.448
 we didn't come from --
 we did.

30:14.482 --> 30:17.896
 and we need to focus if I'm
Going to be doing the driving.

30:17.931 --> 30:21.241
Straight ahead.
 leo and I are backtracking a

30:21.275 --> 30:22.344
Good 20 minutes.

30:22.379 --> 30:24.551
And we went the wrong way.

30:24.586 --> 30:27.000
We wasted like 30, 40 minutes.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.034
We messed up.

30:32.862 --> 30:34.448
 we wasted 30 or 40 minutes.

30:34.482 --> 30:38.344
 a u-turn and we shall see
Where we are now.

30:38.379 --> 30:41.068
 up here, a clue box.
So park somewhere.

30:41.103 --> 30:43.689
 let's do it.
 need some water?

30:43.724 --> 30:46.931
 speak to me in the language
Of juice.

30:46.965 --> 30:49.551
 you pooper.

30:49.586 --> 30:52.000
Why is it doing that?
 what are they doing?

30:52.034 --> 30:53.551
 shooting.

30:53.586 --> 30:54.586
 yeah.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.931
 come on, victor.
 he knocked its head off.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.172
You got it, colin.

31:00.206 --> 31:01.724
 we got another team here.

31:01.758 --> 31:03.206
 unconditional love, babe.

31:03.241 --> 31:05.068
 thank you.
 so sorry.

31:05.103 --> 31:07.689
 this is good right here.
 this is a roadblock made for

31:07.724 --> 31:08.689
Colin.

31:08.724 --> 31:11.344
He's pretty good at this.
 every roadblock.

31:11.379 --> 31:15.000
 actually this is my first
Time I shot a crossbow but shot

31:15.034 --> 31:21.103
A lot of just normal archery.
So I feel good.

31:21.137 --> 31:23.034
 got to aim a little bit
High, I think.

31:23.068 --> 31:24.724
 that's it.
 I see it.

31:24.758 --> 31:27.000
I see it.
 come on, bret.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.965
 chris and bret's car is not
Here.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.103
 that's it?
 chris, right here.

31:31.137 --> 31:32.758
 we got this.
 are you driving?

31:32.793 --> 31:33.551
 yes, sir.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.517
 ignition on?
 I'm a boat guy.

31:35.551 --> 31:36.655
 is that them?

31:36.689 --> 31:39.172
Do you see those boats?
 all we got to do is get to

31:39.206 --> 31:40.379
The grand hotel and we're
Money.

31:40.413 --> 31:42.965
 thank you.
 first place.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.689
 all right.
Colin.

31:45.724 --> 31:48.517
 I think we got some
Gravitational pull coming from

31:48.551 --> 31:57.586
That lake down there.
 you're good.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.827
 do you.

31:59.862 --> 32:02.103
 let's go, victor!

32:02.137 --> 32:03.206
Woo!

32:03.241 --> 32:04.068
 look.

32:04.103 --> 32:05.896
It looks like I hit him right
Here.

32:05.931 --> 32:08.448
So I just got to go up just a
Little bit.

32:08.482 --> 32:11.586
Ammo is a little bit heavy.
So it goes in an arc.

32:11.620 --> 32:13.000
 come on.
Hurry up.

32:13.034 --> 32:14.758
Let's go.
 I see the clue box.

32:14.793 --> 32:17.620
 come on.
 roadblock.

32:17.655 --> 32:20.103
Who wants to be a big shot?
 I will be a big shot.

32:20.137 --> 32:22.931
 all right.
Let's go.

32:22.965 --> 32:25.310
 the afghanimals are -- we
Haven't seen them.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.655
Unless there was no way they --
 they got lost?

32:28.689 --> 32:30.413
 I think so.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.000
 rach, let's go.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.344
We're not the last team.

32:33.379 --> 32:36.862
 my god, really?

32:36.896 --> 32:40.034
 this -- the afghanimals.
 nicole and them are before

32:40.068 --> 32:42.172
Us, everyone is here, bro'.
 let's go.

32:42.206 --> 32:43.586
 hey, what's up, guys?

32:43.620 --> 32:45.034
 are we the last ones?

32:45.068 --> 32:45.896
 yeah.

32:45.931 --> 32:48.068
 come on, rach.
 all right, colin!

32:48.103 --> 32:50.275
 who wants to be a big shot?

32:50.310 --> 32:51.000
 a shooting thing.

32:51.034 --> 32:52.103
 I'll do it.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.275
 ok.

32:53.310 --> 32:56.034
 now all the teams are here
At the roadblock together.

32:56.068 --> 32:58.000
And everyone is accounted for.

32:58.034 --> 32:59.793
Check.

32:59.827 --> 33:03.793
 we are the last team to
Check in to this roadblock and

33:03.827 --> 33:04.551
No room for error.

33:04.586 --> 33:05.448
Pressure is on me.

33:05.482 --> 33:06.862
Just got to perform.

33:06.896 --> 33:08.103
 so close.

33:08.137 --> 33:10.034
 this is it, victor.

33:10.068 --> 33:11.344
For all the marbles.

33:11.379 --> 33:13.344
 everybody is here right now.
So right now it's whoever gets

33:13.379 --> 33:14.758
It first will be in the top
Three.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.517
And a little stressful
Situation right now.

33:17.551 --> 33:20.206
But you got to stay relaxed,
Just aim for the target.

33:20.241 --> 33:22.758
 rach, get your head in the
Game.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.620
 damn it.
 I definitely start to get

33:25.655 --> 33:27.793
Frustrated because now all
Teams are there.

33:27.827 --> 33:32.379
And I realize anyone can shoot
This apple.

33:32.413 --> 33:37.655
 kilo.

33:39.172 --> 33:43.620
Hit it.
Woo!

33:43.655 --> 33:49.896
 making some apple juice
Today.

33:49.931 --> 33:50.551
 ok.

33:50.586 --> 33:51.931
 we got it.
 I'm good.

33:51.965 --> 33:55.310
 woo!
 we're in first place but

33:55.344 --> 33:56.586
Just a little freaked out.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.206
We're not used to being in this
Position and we don't want to

33:59.241 --> 34:00.724
Screw anything up at this
Point.

34:00.758 --> 34:02.275
 who's that?

34:02.310 --> 34:03.655
 that's korey and tyler.

34:03.689 --> 34:04.965
 yeah, it is.
I can tell.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.689
 it's going to be a sprint.
 I know.

34:06.724 --> 34:09.793
 they're going to be so mad
If we end up beating them.

34:09.827 --> 34:14.068
 a funicular runs on a set
Schedule.

34:14.103 --> 34:15.344
We have to go all the way up
Here.

34:15.379 --> 34:16.585
 we're going to run.

34:16.620 --> 34:17.757
 yeah.

34:17.793 --> 34:19.482
 we're going to win this.
 we're going to win this.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.655
 we got this.
We got this.

34:21.688 --> 34:30.413
 I'm holding on to you.
 let's go to the funicular.

34:30.447 --> 34:31.931
 try harder.

34:31.965 --> 34:36.344
Everything you got.
 we're running it.

34:36.379 --> 34:37.344
 get in.

34:37.379 --> 34:47.103
 what time is it, bret?
 we have to go up.

34:47.137 --> 34:50.896
 come on.
 hey, phil.

34:50.931 --> 34:57.413
Tyler and korey.

34:57.448 --> 35:00.241

Switzerland.

35:00.275 --> 35:05.413
Tyler and korey, you are
Team number one.

35:05.448 --> 35:06.344
Congratulations.

35:06.379 --> 35:09.172
-  thank you, phil.

35:09.206 --> 35:13.551
Seven-night luxury river cruise

35:13.586 --> 35:17.586
Vietnam and cambodia.
You will take in the sights

35:17.620 --> 35:22.551
Along the mekong river from
Your state room private

35:22.586 --> 35:23.827
Balcony.

35:23.862 --> 35:28.689
Enjoy all inclusive fine dining
Above the amadara plus daily

35:28.724 --> 35:30.551
Shore excursions at every point
Of call.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.034
-  beautiful.
- A little tension at the

35:32.068 --> 35:32.758
Starting line today.

35:32.793 --> 35:34.379
 you really stirred the pot.

35:34.413 --> 35:35.586
We did stir the pot.

35:35.620 --> 35:38.034
 she loves her drama.
 at the end of the day it's

35:38.068 --> 35:40.551
How you race with your partner
And you can make it to the end.

35:40.586 --> 35:43.275
Maybe that's why korey and I
Are finishing in first place

35:43.310 --> 35:47.206
For the third time in a row.

35:47.241 --> 35:49.344
 you go this.
 good.

35:49.379 --> 35:51.034
 patient.
 it looks like the train that

35:51.068 --> 35:52.724
We would have been on.

35:52.758 --> 35:55.655
The tracks.
 all right.

35:55.689 --> 36:01.551
- Chris and bret.
- Well-run.

36:01.586 --> 36:04.586
So close.
That elusive first place, guys.

36:04.620 --> 36:05.172
 so close.

36:05.206 --> 36:06.448
You were so close.

36:06.482 --> 36:08.206
 but we're so happy to be
Number two.

36:08.241 --> 36:10.379
It showed that we're not
Screwing around here.

36:10.413 --> 36:13.310
The --
 the more important point is

36:13.344 --> 36:15.931
We stepped up and rose to the
Orks and is n-second going on

36:15.965 --> 36:17.103
To the next.

36:17.137 --> 36:19.517
And yeah, we've had some
Scuffle with some people but

36:19.551 --> 36:20.137
That's fine.

36:20.172 --> 36:24.344
That's the race.

36:24.379 --> 36:29.586
 let's go, let's go, let's
Go!

36:29.620 --> 36:31.448
 yes!
Yes!

36:31.482 --> 36:34.655

 you got the legs --

36:34.689 --> 36:35.758
 thank you, thank you.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.241
 let's go, babe.

36:37.275 --> 36:38.344
Come on.

36:38.379 --> 36:41.931
 watching the teams get it
One by one is really

36:41.965 --> 36:42.965
Frustrating.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.379
 that was a whole lot harder
Than it looked.

36:45.413 --> 36:46.620
 but still "The amazing
Race."

36:46.655 --> 36:48.172
You never know what's going to
Happen.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.310
 rach, just breathe and
Focus.

36:50.344 --> 36:52.551
 the only -- we only need one
Shot.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.103
Just me and the afghanimals.

36:54.137 --> 36:56.655
 and literally wasted 30
Minutes trying to get here.

36:56.689 --> 37:00.586
 it was a stupid mistake.
And these other teams taking --

37:00.620 --> 37:03.551
Probably been there 10 or 15 or
20 minutes and had a lot of

37:03.586 --> 37:06.310
Practice shots and only team
That's left is me and rachel.

37:06.344 --> 37:08.000
So game on.
Gloves are off.

37:08.034 --> 37:10.241
Let's go ahead and battle it
Out.

37:10.275 --> 37:12.275
And may the best team win.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.310
 you got this.

37:22.344 --> 37:26.034
Deep breaths.
 rach, you got this.

37:26.068 --> 37:30.413
Come on.

37:30.448 --> 37:32.793
 good job, rach.

37:32.827 --> 37:37.172
Almost.
 it takes just one shot.

37:37.206 --> 37:42.482
 you got this.

37:42.517 --> 37:44.551
 this is everything.

37:44.586 --> 37:47.965
This is basically -- head to
Head against me and rachel.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.793
There's no room for error right
Now.

37:49.827 --> 37:56.482
 I'm so close to that apple.

37:56.517 --> 38:00.172
 my god, yes!
 bingo!

38:00.206 --> 38:00.827
Yes!

38:00.862 --> 38:02.689

38:02.724 --> 38:05.344
Good job.
 congratulations.

38:05.379 --> 38:06.724
 appreciate it.
Appreciate it.

38:06.758 --> 38:08.965
 we're not going to make this
Damn mistake again.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.724
 rach, we're the last team.
 really?

38:10.758 --> 38:11.655
I didn't notice.

38:11.689 --> 38:12.344
 ok.

38:12.379 --> 38:16.758
You got this.
Just have fun.

38:16.793 --> 38:17.482
Don't -- don't get lost.

38:17.517 --> 38:21.310

38:21.344 --> 38:23.862

38:26.137 --> 38:30.413
 come on, elissa.
It's not over.

38:30.448 --> 38:33.172
 when you arrive park in the
Cinema parking lot.

38:33.206 --> 38:39.000
 what's the cinema?
 we got a train.

38:39.034 --> 38:42.448
 it looks like -- waiting for
This stupid train.

38:42.482 --> 38:44.344
 still following signs for
Bret.

38:44.379 --> 38:45.482
 who's that?

38:45.517 --> 38:48.344
 becca and floyd but they're
Lost it looks like.

38:48.379 --> 38:50.344

 grand hotel giessbach.

38:59.310 --> 39:02.000

We're on the lake in

39:02.034 --> 39:05.000

39:14.724 --> 39:16.448
 I do have to say wow.

39:16.482 --> 39:22.793

39:22.827 --> 39:24.931

Double u-turn you are team

39:24.965 --> 39:26.551

To me, I feel like we won this

39:29.482 --> 39:34.931

Million.

39:38.896 --> 39:41.931
And whatever we got to do to do
That, we're willing to do it.

39:41.965 --> 39:47.758
 look at that.

39:47.793 --> 39:50.758
 I'm sorry.

39:50.793 --> 39:53.241
 and trying to lead you guys
And show you the way.

Becca and floyd, you're
Team number four.

39:55.517 --> 39:57.689
-  thank you.
- A little bit of tension

39:57.724 --> 39:59.689
Standing there.
Having to take your vote.

39:59.724 --> 40:00.793
 I just hate that.

40:00.827 --> 40:03.103
I hated that whole thing.
 yeah.

40:03.137 --> 40:07.344
 it is like part of the game.
But like it doesn't matter.

40:07.379 --> 40:09.172
Now there's tension between
Friends.

40:09.206 --> 40:10.068
And it just sucks.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.448
 honestly, I don't blame
Them.

40:12.482 --> 40:18.517
It's bygones be bygones and
That's one and you used it, ok?

40:18.551 --> 40:21.517
 come on.
 let's go, let's go.

40:21.551 --> 40:23.482
 it's going to be a foot
Finish, I think.

40:23.517 --> 40:24.068
 I don't think so.

40:24.103 --> 40:25.034
 I don't know.

40:25.068 --> 40:27.482
 right now where fighting for
Sixth place.

40:27.517 --> 40:32.793
 we're still in it.
Until phil says we're not in

40:32.827 --> 40:34.275
It.
 bon voyage.

40:34.310 --> 40:36.206
 I'll drive it.
 he'll drive it.

40:36.241 --> 40:38.689
 were all the cars there?
 I don't know.

40:38.724 --> 40:39.413
 here.

40:39.448 --> 40:41.137
 look behind you.
Anyone?

40:41.172 --> 40:44.379
 there's rachel and elissa.
 across the lake and to the

40:44.413 --> 40:45.310
Right.

40:45.344 --> 40:51.310
 too close for comfort.
 I'm jumping.

40:51.344 --> 40:54.310
Nicole and victor, very
Tense start to the day.

40:54.344 --> 40:57.724
And look who is arriving here.

40:58.586 --> 41:01.827
 no, you didn't!

41:01.862 --> 41:05.517
-  it was not my doing.
- I love that you're

41:05.551 --> 41:08.931
Hugging it all out considering
That -- they u-turned you.

41:08.965 --> 41:11.137
 we were shocked they
U-turned us and saw the shock

41:11.172 --> 41:14.034
In nicole's eyes.
 and I'm on your side with

41:14.068 --> 41:16.344
It.
 and give them an earful when

41:16.379 --> 41:17.310
You get back home.

41:17.344 --> 41:21.482
 I'm not going out here.

41:21.517 --> 41:26.172
 we're here to win so y'all
Watch out.

41:26.206 --> 41:27.793
 here we come.

41:27.827 --> 41:32.931
Here we come.
 we know, we know.

41:32.965 --> 41:38.206
You know, you know.
Rachel and elissa, I am really

41:38.241 --> 41:41.724
Sorry to tell you that you have
Been eliminated from the race.

41:41.758 --> 41:42.896
 yeah.

41:42.931 --> 41:45.206
I guess I thought it was
Superdelusional that we could

41:45.241 --> 41:46.413
Win.

41:46.448 --> 41:49.034
But --
 rach.

41:49.068 --> 41:52.034
We went out -- we have healthy
Babies.

41:52.068 --> 41:56.241
We got to do the race together.
 looking back, you know, I

41:56.275 --> 41:58.965
Would have loved to be in that
Final three.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.206
But I really don't have
Anything to complain about.

42:02.241 --> 42:04.103
 nothing.
 I've gotten to do this with

42:04.137 --> 42:05.172
My sister.

42:05.206 --> 42:10.103
She's my best friend.
And I've done so many

42:10.137 --> 42:12.620
Incredible things on 32 legs of
Amazing -- of "The amazing

42:12.655 --> 42:16.965
Race" that memories I will tell
My grandkids and they won't

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Believe me.
 we are so blessed.

42:36.379 --> 42:38.379
Stay tuned for scenes
From our negotiation episode.

42:43.689 --> 42:46.310
Next time I'm on "The
Amazing race" -- a scramble for

42:46.344 --> 42:47.310
Flights.

42:47.344 --> 42:49.448

42:49.482 --> 42:52.379
Nicole and victor against
Team fun.

42:52.413 --> 42:54.551

42:54.586 --> 42:59.172
And picturesque split,
Croatia, colin and christie

42:59.206 --> 43:04.068
Make waves.
