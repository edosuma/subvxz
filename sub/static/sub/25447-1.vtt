(Stuttering) Just take a-

46:38.144 --> 46:39.042
No, don't.

46:39.044 --> 46:40.010
Can you please sit
down for one second

46:40.012 --> 46:42.046
- I have to go.
- And we can talk about this?

46:42.048 --> 46:43.347
- <i>No, I need to go!</i>
- Franny, sit down.

46:43.349 --> 46:45.182
Franny: <i>I need to not
be pregnant right now.</i>

46:45.184 --> 46:47.117
Sit down, sit down, okay?

46:47.119 --> 46:48.551
We can talk about this.

46:48.553 --> 46:50.053
Slow down.

46:50.055 --> 46:51.291
It's okay.

46:51.791 --> 46:53.193
Huh, it's okay.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.158
In the off-

46:55.160 --> 46:56.963
in the off chance that
you're pregnant, right?

46:58.064 --> 46:58.863
(Sighs)

46:58.865 --> 47:02.166
We can make that
decision together.

47:02.168 --> 47:03.003
You know?

47:05.104 --> 47:07.975
I-I, you know, I wanna
have a baby, so it's-

47:09.075 --> 47:10.077
You do?

47:11.177 --> 47:14.014
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

47:20.218 --> 47:21.021
Right now?

47:23.088 --> 47:25.691
- <i>I don't know, soon.</i>
- Soon?

47:26.191 --> 47:27.124
<i>I don't-</i>

47:27.126 --> 47:28.526
<i>I feel like we've
talked about this.</i>

47:28.528 --> 47:30.227
Well, we have not
talked about this.

47:30.229 --> 47:31.428
<i>You read a list
of baby names</i>

47:31.430 --> 47:33.363
That list was a joke.

47:33.365 --> 47:36.332
Dan:
<i>Jesus, it was not a joke.</i>

47:36.334 --> 47:39.437
That's how you tell me
you wanna have a baby?

47:39.439 --> 47:41.571
If you were
pregnant right now,

47:41.573 --> 47:42.573
would you keep the baby?

47:42.575 --> 47:44.111
- No.
- Why not?

47:46.178 --> 47:47.412
We're married.

47:47.414 --> 47:49.780
I can want to be married to
you and also not want a child.

47:49.782 --> 47:51.715
Are you saying to me
that you never want to

47:51.717 --> 47:52.816
have a child with me?

47:52.818 --> 47:54.684
No, that's not what I said.
That's not what I said.

47:54.686 --> 47:57.220
Why are we even talking
about this right now?

47:57.222 --> 47:59.226
I'm not gonna have a baby.

48:01.093 --> 48:02.361
What do you want?

48:10.102 --> 48:11.704
I don't wanna fight.

48:24.784 --> 48:26.716
Get you your little drop here.

48:26.718 --> 48:28.320
(Dog Whimpering)

48:30.122 --> 48:32.092
Gotcha, and I gotcha.

48:33.258 --> 48:35.158
Okay, okay.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.160
That was easy.

48:36.162 --> 48:38.562
Now you have X-ray vision.

48:38.564 --> 48:42.135
X-ray vision.

No, Gavin wants
you to run the set.

He's quite the rascal.

49:57.242 --> 49:58.309
Yeah, he's a good boy.

Hello, hey.

50:27.372 --> 50:29.006
How are you?
How was your day?

50:29.008 --> 50:31.374
Good, fine, you know,
it's fine.

50:31.376 --> 50:32.776
Just fine?

50:32.778 --> 50:34.214
Yeah, yeah.

50:34.914 --> 50:36.283
What did you do?

50:38.517 --> 50:41.385
Nothin', just, you know,
walked the dogs,

50:41.387 --> 50:42.389
sort of thing.

50:45.390 --> 50:46.193
Okay.

50:48.427 --> 50:49.863
Wanna know what I did?

50:50.396 --> 50:51.861
Sure.

50:51.863 --> 50:54.867
Oh, I had the craziest day.

50:56.602 --> 50:58.801
So we're on our second
taping of the night, right?

50:58.803 --> 51:02.039
And Gavin makes Noah
and I completely rewrite

51:02.041 --> 51:03.974
everything we had
done the night before.

51:03.976 --> 51:07.278
Like, everything,
which is totally crazy

51:07.280 --> 51:09.780
because Noah had this great
idea that Gavin either

51:09.782 --> 51:13.584
<i>never fully understood
or understood too well</i>

51:13.586 --> 51:16.419
<i>and was threatened by
and therefore scrapped it</i>

51:16.421 --> 51:18.224
<i>before it had the
chance to work.</i>

51:20.325 --> 51:23.794
<i>I got so mad but Noah just
takes it in his very calm,</i>

51:23.796 --> 51:26.296
<i>zen-like way, you know?</i>

51:26.298 --> 51:28.298
He has this great
attitude of like, this job

51:28.300 --> 51:30.334
doesn't define me.

51:30.336 --> 51:32.336
Isn't that a great attitude?

51:32.338 --> 51:34.341
<i>I have a bad attitude,
I should fix that.</i>

51:38.811 --> 51:40.347
(Sighs)

51:51.423 --> 51:53.259
Okay, what's wrong?

51:57.463 --> 52:01.332
Why don't I ever meet the
people that you work with?

52:01.334 --> 52:02.832
You come home and you're
talking about all these people

52:02.834 --> 52:04.867
that I've never met

52:04.869 --> 52:06.470
and you talk about
them all the time.

52:06.472 --> 52:07.870
So I'd like to meet
them at least so I

52:07.872 --> 52:09.405
Trust me, you do not
wanna meet Gavin.

<i>Honestly, you would
mock him to his face.</i>

<i>You wouldn't be
able to handle it.</i>

52:13.611 --> 52:15.479
Okay, what about Noah?

52:15.481 --> 52:16.683
Meet Noah?

52:32.497 --> 52:36.033
We should have him and
Sally over here for dinner.

first dinner party.

didn't care where or when

54:40.626 --> 54:41.624
we got married.

Could be in the fucking
dark for all he cared
