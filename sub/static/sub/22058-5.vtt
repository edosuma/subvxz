00:06.882 --> 00:08.634
[female voice] <i>Previously on </i>Z Nation...

00:09.635 --> 00:11.053
Do you have any idea where
the hell we're going?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.638
-East.
-How far East?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.057
-As far as we can go.
-I mean, we want to believe,

00:15.265 --> 00:17.142
<i>but you've got to give us
something to believe in.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.562
I don't know what the dream
means, but I have to follow it.

00:20.646 --> 00:24.107
It doesn't feel like I have much
of a choice. But you do.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.652
-I go where you go.
-Me too.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.111
Well if you're going, I'm going.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.882
Why does the Apocalypse
always have to be so hot?

00:50.259 --> 00:52.719
Yeah, I think they were right
about global warming.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.557
Warren, you have any visions
of cool mountain streams?

00:57.182 --> 00:58.308
'Cause we need water.

01:00.936 --> 01:01.853
Have mine.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.399
What do you think?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.318
I think we should check it out.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.153
What's that truck doing there?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.905
Waiting for us to steal it.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.323
Zona?

01:14.575 --> 01:15.909
Could be.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.328
Let's move in easy.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.123
Sarge and I will check it out.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.751
And Murphy, you stay with Lucy.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.380
What's with the gear?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.716
I dunno.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.677
Why don't we see if we can
find somebody to ask.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.723
Cover me.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.698
Cab's clear. Nobody's home.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.868
Finder's Keepers. I am tired of walking.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.078
Now hold on. Don't you think
it's a little odd

02:00.162 --> 02:01.913
that they'd leave this
awesome truck right here

02:01.997 --> 02:02.956
in the middle of nowhere.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.333
You know what else is odd?

02:04.833 --> 02:07.127
Everything that's happened
to us over the last eight years.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.129
-Smells like a trap.
-That's just Murphy.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.423
No. She's right.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.634
This isn't important.
We should keep moving.

02:13.759 --> 02:16.219
Well... at least let's check this gear
for water.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.221
Who you suppose left all this?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.474
Yeah. And where are they now?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.101
You don't think they're still alive
back there, do you?

02:25.354 --> 02:26.772
You picking up anything?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.904
Any signs of life?

02:35.238 --> 02:37.032
Any signs of the undead?

02:37.866 --> 02:40.494
If they're still in there,
they're not zombies.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.954
Not exactly reassuring.

02:48.335 --> 02:50.587
Yeah, looks like a truck.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.090
We should go.

02:53.757 --> 02:57.636
Well, wait, wait. I mean don't
we want to look inside?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.304
[engine turns]

02:59.388 --> 03:02.516
No, no, no. Hold your fire.
Don't. Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.642
Say the word, Lieutenant.
We'll light it up.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.436
No, no. Something's not right.
I think we should go.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.689
Well wait.
Don't you want to see what's inside?

03:09.815 --> 03:13.068
I mean it could be full of snacks
for all we know.

03:14.861 --> 03:15.946
It could happen!

03:19.032 --> 03:19.991
Look!

03:21.368 --> 03:22.911
The damn thing's following us.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.498
[engine revs]

03:39.344 --> 03:40.887
Doc and 10K, cover the cab.

03:41.346 --> 03:45.434
Sarge, if anything bad happens,
shoot the tires first and then the engine.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.269
Murphy, stay with Lucy!

03:48.019 --> 03:49.688
Don't shoot till I say!

03:56.987 --> 03:58.155
[loud sharp noise]

04:11.209 --> 04:12.794
[all scream]

04:18.341 --> 04:20.802
[heavy breathing]

04:39.404 --> 04:40.238
Hello!

04:41.698 --> 04:42.532
Hello!

04:43.992 --> 04:44.910
Hello!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.180
Help! Murphy!

05:06.223 --> 05:07.390
Doc!

05:07.474 --> 05:08.892
Is anybody there?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.978
[rumbling]

05:19.402 --> 05:21.112
[alarm buzzes]

05:28.954 --> 05:30.038
[grunts]

05:37.420 --> 05:38.255
[groans]

05:46.263 --> 05:47.097
[growling]

05:47.639 --> 05:49.224
Get the key. Hurry.

05:58.984 --> 05:59.943
Why'd you kill him?

06:00.151 --> 06:01.486
Only one crowbar.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.322
What's going on? What is this place?

06:04.656 --> 06:07.200
You don't know? How long
have you been here?

06:07.284 --> 06:08.118
We just got here.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.870
Right. Fresh meat. Just my luck.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.914
And how long you been here?

06:13.164 --> 06:15.875
Lost track of time. A month maybe.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.503
I was with five others.
Something happened.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.590
And a sound. I'm sure I passed out.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.718
You can't fight the sound.
Just do what they want.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.095
-What who wants?
-No one knows.

06:27.596 --> 06:31.057
Just kill anything that moves.
And stay out of my way.

06:31.975 --> 06:32.809
Don't worry.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.287
They want us to clear this elevator.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.788
Who are they?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.416
Nobody knows.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.715
[muffled growling]

07:05.383 --> 07:06.551
Watch yourself.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.429
Use the key.

07:18.521 --> 07:20.065
[mechanical whirring]

07:27.197 --> 07:28.406
Not again.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.586
[growling]

07:44.464 --> 07:46.257
[screams]

07:55.266 --> 07:57.560
[muffled screams]

08:01.564 --> 08:03.358
Shit, Roberta.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.859
The key.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.433
[whispers] Shit.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.144
I've got to get out of here.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.189
[Doc] Warren? Warren, is that you?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.941
Doc? Hey, Doc! Can you hear me?

09:27.150 --> 09:30.028
Loud and clear, chief! Are you OK?

09:30.111 --> 09:34.115
I think so. I'm...
I'm trapped in some kind of crate.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.242
Yeah, me too. I think
we've been kidnapped

09:36.326 --> 09:38.078
and enslaved for evil purposes.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.746
Again!

09:40.455 --> 09:42.082
God, I hate when this happens.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.125
Me too.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.129
Have you seen or heard anyone else?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.173
Just the two ugly dudes I woke up with.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.592
They were killed on
some kind of suicide mission

09:52.675 --> 09:54.302
to clear a stairwell of zombies.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.680
And when I killed the last Z,
I heard that noise.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.309
And I passed out.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.229
Now what?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.567
Doc? Hey Doc, what's happening?

10:09.692 --> 10:11.861
They're moving me again!

10:12.654 --> 10:13.488
Doc!

10:13.738 --> 10:14.906
[muffled] Warren! Warren!

10:14.989 --> 10:16.032
Doc!

10:19.744 --> 10:21.287
[rumbling and thumping]

10:27.544 --> 10:28.378
Bastards.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.269
-10k?
-Doc?

10:44.352 --> 10:45.645
[both] What are you doing here?

10:50.066 --> 10:51.192
What's that smell?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.530
Get the mask and the tape.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.460
-[hissing]
-[coughing]

11:16.926 --> 11:17.969
Come on!

11:27.937 --> 11:31.024
Some kinda gas.
They must want us to stop these leaks.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.425
[growling]

12:03.431 --> 12:05.475
[breathes heavily]

12:43.137 --> 12:45.640
<i>[Murphy] Watch it! I'm in here.</i>

12:46.015 --> 12:47.558
<i>Mysterious morons.</i>

12:47.642 --> 12:49.894
<i>[Warren] Murphy? Murphy, is that you?</i>

12:49.978 --> 12:51.938
Warren? Warren!

12:52.605 --> 12:55.358
Thank God.
I thought you were all dead.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.609
Again.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.361
Get me out of here.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.530
No can do. I'm locked in a crate too.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.908
Well that sucks. So was this
all part of your vision?

13:03.992 --> 13:04.826
No.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.078
I tried to walk away.
But part of me knew.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.623
-Who else is there?
-US Marines. Representing.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.667
Doc, but he's gone again.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.003
Lucy? She with you?

13:15.211 --> 13:16.129
I'm alive.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.214
Lulu! Are you OK?

13:18.673 --> 13:20.883
I'm fine. And call me Lucy.

13:22.010 --> 13:22.969
Is Warren here?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.930
Yes, I'm here. Don't worry, Lucy.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.473
Will you people shut up.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.267
-I'm trying to sleep.
-Who's that?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.394
Fresh meat. Hard to say how many.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.312
Be quiet. You'll get us all killed.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.358
[snarling]

13:40.403 --> 13:41.404
Warren?

13:41.612 --> 13:44.198
-Yeah, sweetheart?
-Do you feel them?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.451
Yes, but not like you do.

13:47.702 --> 13:50.163
-There's a lot of them.
-I know.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.749
But it's not the Zs I'm worried about.

14:04.302 --> 14:05.511
[growling]

14:05.595 --> 14:07.430
10K! Wrench!

14:09.766 --> 14:10.808
Mask!

14:12.393 --> 14:13.394
Got it.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.901
[growling]

14:21.194 --> 14:23.738
-[growling]
-[groaning]

14:27.742 --> 14:29.494
[coughs]

14:38.419 --> 14:41.881
I can't be here. I can't be here.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.138
Even the zombies are afraid.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.223
Can you tell why?

14:51.182 --> 14:52.392
Too many voices.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.729
-So many reasons.
-What about you, Mr. Murphy?

14:57.647 --> 14:58.773
Picking up anything?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.235
No, not me.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.154
My zombie whispering days are over.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.032
I'm cured. Remember?

15:14.705 --> 15:15.540
Careful.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.043
Like pulling a thread from a sweater.

15:26.467 --> 15:29.095
-[hissing]
-[growling]

15:33.766 --> 15:36.102
Doc! Hang on, Doc!

15:53.953 --> 15:55.746
<i>Miss Warren, are you all right?</i>

15:56.330 --> 15:57.665
Something's wrong, isn't it?

15:59.834 --> 16:03.254
I can't do this. I can't...
I can't do this.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.381
Roberta? You OK?

16:05.673 --> 16:08.050
-I don't feel so good.
-You don't sound so good.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.678
I can't... I can't do this.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.431
OK, Warren, listen to me.

16:13.514 --> 16:17.226
You cannot freak out. All right?
Look, there's no pressure here.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.062
But if you go wobbly, we all die, OK?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.732
There's no freaking in the Apocalypse.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.901
-Warren?
-Let me try.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.739
I have some experience with PTSD.
Lieutenant Warren? Lieutenant?

16:29.989 --> 16:30.907
Roberta?

16:32.783 --> 16:34.285
You're having a panic attack.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.162
Just remember it only feels
like it'll kill you.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.789
First thing we got to do is get in control
of your breath.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.083
You're hyperventilating, which is robbing
your body of oxygen.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.420
Can you take one long
deep breath for me?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.630
Can you do that?

16:46.631 --> 16:49.800
And as you exhale,
start thinking of your happy place.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.637
A place only you know
where no one can harm you.

16:53.596 --> 16:54.889
Inhale.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.683
This place, what's it smell like?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.602
Smell different? Fresher?

17:00.478 --> 17:01.979
And exhale.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.987
How'd you get good at this?

17:10.196 --> 17:12.198
My C.O. Lieutenant Mueller
taught me to meditate.

17:12.657 --> 17:16.452
Had some pretty bad PTSD after
spending some time in a tight place.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.747
Actually, nine days in the trunk of a car.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.041
Zombies?

17:22.124 --> 17:22.959
Yeah.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.169
My family.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.386
How you doing Lieutenant?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.013
Better.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.182
Thank you.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.806
I think we won or something.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.604
Is that our way out?

18:26.314 --> 18:27.690
[loud screeching]

18:51.797 --> 18:52.632
Doc?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.592
Doc, is that you?

18:55.301 --> 18:56.218
Are you all right?

18:56.302 --> 18:59.805
Doc's fine. Just some
nerve gas or something.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.724
I'm fine too, thanks for asking.

19:01.849 --> 19:02.850
I wasn't.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.394
-I noticed.
-What happened to you guys?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.522
Well, we were just fixing the leaks
in hell's plumbing.

19:09.023 --> 19:13.027
We got to find a way out of here
or they're gonna kill us, one by one.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.655
Yeah. Who's running this show
and what is their problem?

19:15.738 --> 19:17.198
It's got to be a Zona operation.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.076
Nobody else is so needlessly diabolical.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.243
[farts]

19:22.453 --> 19:24.372
-Sorry kid.
-What?

19:25.539 --> 19:26.999
I'm making a friend.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.214
-[snarling]
-Hello, Carson O'Keefe.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.467
-Carson?
-That's his name. Now quiet.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.178
-[banging]
-[growling]

19:39.261 --> 19:44.392
That's right, Carson.
I'm in here. I'm in here.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.518
Yeah.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.104
I'm in here and I want
to get out, Carson.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.064
Can you get me out?

19:51.565 --> 19:55.778
Open the door for me and let me out.
That's right, Carson. Just do it.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.155
-[snarling]
-Do it, Carson.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.866
Open the door and let me out.

20:01.325 --> 20:03.786
-Lucy?
-I'm working here, dad.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.497
That's right, Carson.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.124
You can do it.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.251
-[knocking]
-Open the door.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.220
You must be Carson.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.431
[growls]

20:28.394 --> 20:29.937
Oh my!

20:31.814 --> 20:33.274
Can you see how to get out of here?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.194
No.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.413
-[loud screeching sound]
-[all yell]

20:48.330 --> 20:50.750
Try to stay awake! Fight it!

20:59.967 --> 21:01.093
Fight!

21:30.706 --> 21:32.875
-What are you doing?
-You're safer in here with me.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.129
[growling]

22:09.078 --> 22:12.039
We'll live a lot longer
if we work together as a team.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.416
I'll hold up my end when the time comes.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.794
I bet you do.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.129
Look,

22:19.672 --> 22:21.340
let's just do whatever
it is they want us to do

22:21.423 --> 22:22.758
and get out of here alive, OK?

22:23.259 --> 22:25.135
I don't need more trouble
than I got already.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.513
You know there's a...

22:27.930 --> 22:30.474
good chance we'll never
get out of here alive.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.518
Better chance you won't
get out of here alive

22:33.018 --> 22:34.353
if you don't get out
from in front of that door.

22:34.436 --> 22:37.439
I'm... not looking
for any trouble. Just...

22:39.024 --> 22:40.276
some human kindness.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.362
How 'bout a little mercy instead.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.656
Try that again and I will blow
your goddamn head off!

22:45.739 --> 22:48.033
[laughs]

22:48.117 --> 22:49.285
No bullets.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.452
What?

22:50.661 --> 22:52.580
No bullets.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.582
I was out of ammo.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.667
[gun clicks]

23:09.305 --> 23:10.472
Don't do this.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.890
Do what?

23:12.224 --> 23:13.309
[grunts]

23:19.565 --> 23:21.191
[growling]

23:21.859 --> 23:23.027
[yells]

23:58.771 --> 24:00.439
[panting]

24:03.692 --> 24:04.526
-[growls]
-[yells]

24:14.745 --> 24:16.705
You know, this whole thing
would be a lot more efficient

24:16.872 --> 24:18.791
if they just told us what
the hell they wanted

24:18.874 --> 24:20.459
instead of all this mystery.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.211
[growls]

24:25.297 --> 24:28.717
Well that's the whole point.
It's the fear of the unknown.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.802
[growls]

24:31.553 --> 24:32.888
They're trying to control us through that

24:33.013 --> 24:35.349
psychological terror
and them creepy sounds.

24:35.599 --> 24:37.643
Yeah, well if we ever get out
of here, and that's a big if.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.852
[growling]

24:40.813 --> 24:41.855
We're gonna have to have

24:41.939 --> 24:44.358
a come to Zombie Jesus moment with Warren.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.526
What does that mean?

24:45.984 --> 24:48.696
First of all, she gets us lost
in the Not So Great Pile.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.948
-Not so great.
-[growling]

24:53.033 --> 24:55.869
And now we're slaves in the Zombie
Funhouse of Death.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.666
-Might be time for new leadership.
-Yeah, well can we get out of here first?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.335
[growling]

25:45.127 --> 25:46.336
[yells]

25:55.971 --> 25:58.140
-No!
-[yells]

26:05.814 --> 26:06.899
[growling]

26:06.982 --> 26:08.442
[loud screeching noise]

26:45.771 --> 26:46.772
Shall we?

27:03.622 --> 27:06.792
[chuckles] Poor bastard's
nearly chopped in half.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.043
[growls]

27:14.967 --> 27:17.135
-Drop your weapon.
-All right. OK.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.765
What is Zona doing here?
And is this part of The Reset?

27:21.932 --> 27:23.058
The what?

27:23.183 --> 27:27.062
Answer me or this screwdriver
is going through your brainpan.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.730
Is this part of The Reset?

27:28.814 --> 27:30.983
And what do you know
about the Black Rainbow?

27:32.109 --> 27:35.445
-What?
-What is the Black Rainbow?

27:35.529 --> 27:37.030
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:37.114 --> 27:37.948
Are you insane?

27:38.198 --> 27:40.617
Zona doesn't have anything
to do with this.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.620
You know how many dead Zona
soldiers I've seen down here?

27:44.037 --> 27:45.455
This ain't Zona.

27:45.539 --> 27:46.582
If you lie to me...

27:46.832 --> 27:50.752
It's the truth. This is bigger than Zona.
This is bigger than the Apocalypse.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.047
If it's not Zona,

27:55.966 --> 27:58.010
then who is it?

27:59.595 --> 28:01.972
Nobody lives long enough to find out.

28:03.390 --> 28:07.603
They're after something in this complex.
And they're using us to clear the Zs.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.231
We're gonna be Zs too unless
we get this gate open

28:11.315 --> 28:12.399
like they want.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.697
OK. That must be what this is for.

28:28.457 --> 28:29.708
It's jammed.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.256
[growls]

28:36.798 --> 28:38.091
We got a live one.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.851
Hold on! I got this!

28:48.977 --> 28:50.354
[growling]

28:54.358 --> 28:55.484
Comin' in hot!

29:09.289 --> 29:10.791
[panting]

29:12.584 --> 29:14.461
[pattering]

29:19.633 --> 29:20.759
Daylight.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.265
A bird.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.851
Hi, little birdie.
Where'd you come from?

29:35.732 --> 29:37.067
-[loud screeching noise]
-No!

30:10.892 --> 30:14.563
-It's locked.
-Everybody OK?

30:15.355 --> 30:16.940
The sergeant isn't waking up.

30:17.065 --> 30:19.318
She'll come around.
Here just raise her head.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.612
-Shake her a little bit.
-What fresh hell is this?

30:24.072 --> 30:25.073
Feedin' time.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.075
Great. I'm starving.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.286
What's on the menu?

30:29.369 --> 30:30.954
[engine whirs]

30:52.309 --> 30:53.226
What is that?

30:53.643 --> 30:55.896
-Dog food.
-I love dog food.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.360
It's good. Not even stale.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.696
Hint of chicken. Subtle notes of corn.

31:04.821 --> 31:05.906
And fortified.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.074
That's puppy chow.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.993
Puppy chow's my stuff, man.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.954
Remember in Kansas
when we were so starved

31:13.038 --> 31:14.289
we couldn't even walk?

31:14.623 --> 31:16.833
And then we found that fifty
pound bag of Gravy Train.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.543
Man, I can taste it now.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.337
Add a little water,
warm it up in the sun,

31:20.420 --> 31:21.380
and get that gravy going.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.632
That's the next best
thing to home cooking.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.052
Hey pal, why are they just
milling around like that?

31:27.302 --> 31:31.098
They keep them well fed. But...
step out of the cage, and they'll attack.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.265
What do they feed them?

31:33.266 --> 31:34.518
Not dog food.

31:38.647 --> 31:39.856
The Sarge is waking up.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.442
-Where am I?
-Easy.

31:42.526 --> 31:43.652
Still the Apocalypse.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.405
And we saved you some Puppy Chow.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.580
Bird.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.207
Bird! Bird! I saw a bird!

31:59.042 --> 32:01.545
-It was alive when I got it.
-Let me see that bird.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.137
Wait. If a bird can get in, then
there must be a way out of here.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.721
I saw sunlight.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.723
Murphy?

32:13.974 --> 32:15.142
Did you eat the bird?

32:17.394 --> 32:18.353
No.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.230
Never mind that.

32:20.480 --> 32:23.358
Look, she saw daylight,
which means we have a chance.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.695
You think you could find
your way back there again?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.239
If I had a map.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.366
All right.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.452
So we know the stairwell
leads to the surface.

32:33.618 --> 32:37.289
Yeah, I think I saw an emergency exit door
off that hallway with hell's plumbing.

32:37.873 --> 32:41.543
Well, either that or it was
an actual door to hell.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.045
OK. So can you show me where?

32:44.129 --> 32:46.798
Well, I think it was like maybe like here.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.676
Right there. Maybe here?

32:50.260 --> 32:53.597
No, I think it was more over here.
We went around three turns.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.807
Yeah, kid's right.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.101
Just stay away from this gate over here.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.478
Torso zombie.

32:59.561 --> 33:03.273
All right, that's a good start.
Anybody else have any other landmarks?

33:03.648 --> 33:05.317
There's a long hallway here,

33:05.400 --> 33:08.111
and then two sets of revolving doors
at the end right there.

33:08.403 --> 33:12.908
The hallway that lead to the stairwell
seems longer then the rest... maybe,

33:15.035 --> 33:16.912
All right.
Well, we'll go to that, take a left,

33:16.995 --> 33:18.205
then we'll go right here.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.582
We're going straight up...

33:20.665 --> 33:21.875
On the right...

33:27.964 --> 33:29.549
All right then, that's the plan.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.802
You all know what to do.
Memorize this map.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.096
And find your way to the rendezvous point.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.767
[loud screeching noise]

33:38.850 --> 33:43.188
All right. We regroup at the stairwell.
And then fight your way to the surface!

34:07.045 --> 34:08.046
There you are.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.924
All right, we got a rope, a bowling pin,
and a blowtorch.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.093
Pick one and come on.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.249
[whispers] Warren?

34:45.917 --> 34:46.918
Warren?

34:54.175 --> 34:55.176
Murphy?

34:57.012 --> 34:58.471
Warren?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.059
Murphy?

35:04.144 --> 35:05.353
Roberta?

35:11.776 --> 35:12.652
Warren?

35:15.572 --> 35:16.740
[click]

35:28.043 --> 35:29.544
[growling]

35:39.638 --> 35:40.764
Let's hit it.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.582
You sure this is the right stairwell?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.626
I don't hear any birds.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.506
-Well, there's your answer.
-Crap.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.049
Literally.

36:17.801 --> 36:18.843
Where's Lucy?

36:19.969 --> 36:22.972
You know what, let's keep moving.
She might be ahead of us.

36:52.419 --> 36:53.586
Shit.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.589
[loud screeching noise]

37:01.386 --> 37:02.846
[all yelling]

37:25.034 --> 37:25.994
Man.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.078
Shi...

37:27.787 --> 37:28.830
Come on.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.666
Well now what do we do?

37:31.750 --> 37:35.170
I dunno about you,
but I'm just gonna curl up and die.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.046
Nobody's curling up to die, Doc.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.426
Look, I may not know much
or pretend to understand what I do know,

37:42.218 --> 37:45.221
but I am certain,
dying here is not our fate.

37:45.805 --> 37:48.099
Well I'm so glad
you're certain of something.

37:48.975 --> 37:53.021
So what is our fate
if it's not taking out the zombie trash

37:53.104 --> 37:54.439
for our invisible captors?

37:55.190 --> 37:57.400
I just know something bad is coming.

37:58.151 --> 38:02.113
And I'm supposed to stop it.
I can't tell you why.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.282
I just feel it.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.955
Just like I felt the first time
I laid eyes on you, Murphy.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.793
I didn't know the how, why,

38:15.585 --> 38:18.338
or any of the what was coming next.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.842
The second I saw you,
I knew my job in life

38:22.926 --> 38:25.762
was to get you wherever
the hell you were going.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.515
Well, when you put it that way.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.351
-Daddy, it's me!
-Lucy?

38:31.434 --> 38:32.560
Look who I found.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.354
You remember Carson.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.022
Hello, Carson.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.068
OK, come on. Let's go get the others.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.121
Come on. Carson said it's this way.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.999
Don't worry. The zombies won't hurt us.

38:55.083 --> 38:58.127
Quick, before they realize we're gone.
Hustle. Hustle. Move!

39:07.929 --> 39:09.305
There's a new lock.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.557
I got the key.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.100
Good man.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.354
Wait, Carson.

39:18.106 --> 39:18.940
Freeze!

39:19.732 --> 39:22.485
I don't want to do this,
but we're supposed to stop you.

39:22.861 --> 39:23.862
No!

39:23.945 --> 39:25.363
-Dad!
-No!

39:25.446 --> 39:26.865
-No!
-Dad!

39:27.115 --> 39:29.492
Don't forget who's got
the gun here, buddy.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.077
Everyone back to their cage.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.830
-That ain't gonna happen.
-Everyone move now!

39:34.163 --> 39:35.832
-[growling]
-[gunfire]

39:39.460 --> 39:40.920
Get that door open!

39:43.798 --> 39:46.134
-Carson! No!
-Lucy, no!

39:46.509 --> 39:47.635
Lucy!

39:52.515 --> 39:53.766
Come on!

39:56.895 --> 39:57.937
Got it!

40:01.691 --> 40:03.234
You can't help him now!

40:12.744 --> 40:15.288
-[loud screeching noise]
-Go! Go now!

40:29.677 --> 40:30.637
Dad.

40:35.683 --> 40:36.935
He's bleeding.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.102
Get this off.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.524
He's bit.

40:43.816 --> 40:47.195
-But he's immune.
-Not anymore. Not since he's been cured.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.780
He's not turning yet.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.991
OK, we can't stay here any longer.
Hey, hey, hey.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.201
Can you walk?

40:53.409 --> 40:56.037
-Yeah, I can try.
-OK, I need you to.

40:58.414 --> 40:59.248
OK.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.757
Are you kidding me?

41:17.600 --> 41:18.768
Right where we left it.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.979
All our gear is still here too.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.023
Yeah, looks like they kidnapped
more victims in the meantime.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.442
Come on, let's get our stuff.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.038
[loud screeching noise]

41:48.798 --> 41:50.508
-How's he doing?
-Not so good.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.969
He's going in and out of consciousness.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.178
Help him!

41:54.512 --> 41:56.305
What do you want to do, Warren?

41:56.639 --> 41:58.933
-Warren?
-It's OK.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.019
-Warren!
-Lieutenant Warren?
