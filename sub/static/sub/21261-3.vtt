WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:04.638
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
tech pioneer Darius Tanz!

00:04.672 --> 00:05.773
LIAM:
Sir, my name is Liam Cole.

00:05.806 --> 00:08.242
In 186 days, an asteroid's
gonna collide with Earth,

00:08.276 --> 00:11.245
and we're all gonna die.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.147
Previously on Salvation...

00:13.181 --> 00:14.482
What's Atlas?

00:14.515 --> 00:16.717
Don't say that word
to anybody, ever.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.153
AMANDA: Looks like I got
a real story now.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.621
All we need
is a working EM drive

00:20.654 --> 00:21.789
and I can build it.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.091
I just need help

00:23.124 --> 00:24.292
to expedite it
over the finish line.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.426
What kind of help?
Malcolm Croft.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.428
LIAM: My professor?
CROFT: I've been trying

00:27.461 --> 00:28.662
to crack the EM drive
for years.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.597
And I'm not the only one.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.265
Then let's compare notes,
see if together,

00:31.299 --> 00:33.234
we can't do the impossible.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.636
Get me what I need.
Fine. What else do you need?

00:35.669 --> 00:38.139
A hundred kilos of
enriched uranium.
Oh.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.408
You want to help me save
the human race or don't you?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
You're stealing the code.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.378
GRACE: I'm stealing uranium from
the United States government.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.314
DARIUS:
And betraying a man you love.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.819
(static crackles)

00:51.852 --> 00:54.555
DISPATCHER:
...213.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.091
DYLAN: Keep recording.
This is an act of war.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.227
Get back. Back up!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.795
If you don't think we're at war,
think again.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.365
This building behind me
produces nuclear weapons,

01:04.398 --> 01:07.368
like the ones reportedly headed
to Florida to be decommissioned.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.636
Funny, I was always told

01:08.669 --> 01:10.371
we decommissioned our nukes
in Utah.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.406
Last I checked, Florida's
where we launch things.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.242
(sirens wailing)

01:16.744 --> 01:19.680
Who do you think...
DYLAN: Hey!

01:19.713 --> 01:23.384
(men shouting)

01:23.417 --> 01:24.352
(woman yells)

01:24.385 --> 01:26.254
(grunting)

01:27.788 --> 01:29.257
Get down on the ground!

01:29.290 --> 01:30.791
And stay on the ground, now!

01:33.427 --> 01:35.429
(phone vibrating)

01:39.400 --> 01:41.369
(both moaning softly)

01:41.402 --> 01:42.603
Don't.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.238
(laughs softly)

01:44.272 --> 01:46.407
Oh, Zoe...
(kisses)

01:48.576 --> 01:49.710
(sighs)

01:49.743 --> 01:50.778
...has poison ivy.

01:50.811 --> 01:51.912
Hmm.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.148
Two days camping
with her dad.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.284
Mouthwash.
Hmm?

01:56.317 --> 01:58.386
For the poison ivy,
stops the itching.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.388
(laughs)

02:00.421 --> 02:02.490
You have an answer
for everything.

02:02.523 --> 02:05.359
Yeah, well,
that's my military training.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.196
Ready for anything, anytime.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.863
Really?
Yeah.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.899
(moans)

02:22.576 --> 02:24.412
(beeps, clicks)

02:27.281 --> 02:29.483
HARRIS: What gets red wine out?
Was it salt or peroxide?

02:31.352 --> 02:32.386
Harris.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.954
Hmm?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.623
I need to tell you...
(phone rings)

02:35.656 --> 02:37.391
(sighs)

02:39.593 --> 02:40.794
(grunts)

02:40.828 --> 02:42.796
(clears throat)
Turn it...

02:42.830 --> 02:45.433
HARRIS:
The White House.

02:45.466 --> 02:48.369
Wants an update
from the task force, right now.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.710
DARIUS:
Human beings.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.979
We have limits.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.350
Or we think we do.

03:02.383 --> 03:05.653
Just when it seems we've gone
as far as we can go...

03:07.721 --> 03:09.723
...we go further.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.525
Innovation is not about "why,"

03:11.559 --> 03:14.628
it's about "why not?"

03:15.929 --> 03:18.432
Tanz Industries.
Changing your world.

03:18.466 --> 03:23.371
And, behind those doors, the
world's greatest minds are busy

03:23.404 --> 03:24.772
breaking all the rules.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.441
I'd like to direct
everyone's attention

03:27.475 --> 03:28.909
to the Goliath Two rocket.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.645
Colonizing Mars is a priority
for Mr. Tanz,

03:31.679 --> 03:34.748
and this state of the art rocket
will be what takes us

03:34.782 --> 03:37.551
to the red planet
within the next decade.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.423
CROFT:
Fantastic.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.424
"Fantastic"?
Yeah.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.559
Those microwaves are
flying all over the place.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.727
It looks like a blender
in there.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.928
This is what it's
supposed to look like.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.730
CROFT:
And it will, it will.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.798
We just need to find
the right frequency

03:50.831 --> 03:52.300
and the waves
will fall into line...

03:52.333 --> 03:53.934
And create
thrust, I know.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.437
I guess I just thought once we
got those emitters online,

03:56.470 --> 03:57.971
we'd start seeing something.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.507
CROFT: I've been
trying to build

03:59.540 --> 04:01.842
a working EM drive
for seven years.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.011
This is how science gets done,
Mr. Cole.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.448
It's sweat and patience,
and more sweat.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.949
Good morning, gentlemen.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.651
You two look like hell.
Hi.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.919
When was the last time
you slept?

04:11.952 --> 04:12.953
Uh, Monday, maybe.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.555
Well, it depends what day it is.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.289
Tess?

04:15.323 --> 04:16.757
TESS:
Today is Friday, Liam.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.292
Oh, that's bad.

04:18.326 --> 04:20.561
So how's our EM drive
coming along?

04:20.594 --> 04:23.297
Simulations still not
producing any thrust.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.632
But, the team here

04:24.665 --> 04:26.567
has made incredible progress
with the emitters.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.701
Emitters?
Yeah.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.537
W-We don't need
one small step for man,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.905
we need the giant leap
for mankind right now.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.407
The process is methodical.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.942
Malcolm,
this isn't MIT.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.044
There's no time.
Big moves equal big results.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.946
The world doesn't care how
you get there, just get there.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.914
Hmm. Fast and loose.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.916
Some things never
change with you, Darius.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.785
Yeah, fast, never loose.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.488
I think I'm gonna make myself
an espresso.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.590
Or three.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.792
So...

04:51.825 --> 04:53.994
I take it that no one else here

04:54.027 --> 04:56.330
knows why there's a rush
on this EM drive project?

04:56.364 --> 04:58.031
You, me, uh, and Lazlo.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.800
CROFT:
Lazlo?

04:59.833 --> 05:00.934
I've known Laz
since I was a boy.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.671
You, you're safe here, I can
vouch for that personally.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.739
I hope so, because whoever
was after me in Boston,

05:05.773 --> 05:07.741
there's no telling what
they'll do if they find me.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.411
Then we'll make sure they don't.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.380
(grunts)

05:14.982 --> 05:16.817
(scoffs)

05:19.820 --> 05:20.788
(machinery whirring)

05:20.821 --> 05:22.623
Liam.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.758
Fancy meeting you here.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.093
It's Liam, right?

05:26.126 --> 05:27.595
Yeah, good memory.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.029
How could I forget
our four minutes together?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.498
You here for the,
uh, the tour, Amanda?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.400
Yes.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.634
And I came to see you.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.703
Really? Huh.
I was hoping

05:35.736 --> 05:37.471
you could help out
a fellow millennial.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.073
Oh, I love being reduced
to a cultural stereotype.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.609
Annie Hall.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.511
Yeah. Nobody ever gets that.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.680
I like
surprising people.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.450
You're a reporter.
(espresso pours)

05:49.483 --> 05:50.350
I should've told you
at the embassy,

05:50.384 --> 05:52.019
but I didn't want
to ruin the moment.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.154
We were having a moment?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.556
I thought so.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.391
Anyway, I want to do

05:57.425 --> 05:58.826
a piece on Darius Tanz.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.729
Something splashy to
earn my keep at Capitol Eyes.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.131
You think you could
grease the wheels for me?

06:04.164 --> 06:05.666
(laughs softly)

06:05.699 --> 06:06.800
LAZLO: Excuse me.
You don't have clearance

06:06.834 --> 06:07.935
to be in this area.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.136
Oh, sorry.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.038
I got lost on the way
to the loo.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.673
I'll help you
find your way back.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.141
Liam, you have a visitor
in the lobby.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.576
I do?

06:15.609 --> 06:16.510
Good to see you, Liam.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
You know where to reach me.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.050
TOUR GUIDE:
...breaking all the rules.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.985
And, over here, I'd like
to direct everyone's attention.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.420
Jillian?

06:26.454 --> 06:27.988
Liam.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.657
Hey.
Hi!

06:29.690 --> 06:31.058
Hey.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.893
What are you,
what are you doing here?

06:32.926 --> 06:34.928
So, some guy named Lazlo

06:34.962 --> 06:36.764
just showed up at the
bookstore the other day.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.999
He said that Darius Tanz
wanted to meet me.

06:39.032 --> 06:42.670
I'm getting a tour,
and he's taking me to lunch.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.137
Wow.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.073
I assumed it was because of you.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.608
Well, yeah.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.743
Yeah, I-I told him
all about you.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.612
I just, I didn't realize
that was today.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.714
Yeah.
That's, uh...

06:53.747 --> 06:55.649
(chuckles)
I'm really glad to see you.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.784
Me, too.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.118
You look...

06:58.151 --> 06:59.820
Like crap, I know.
No, I was gonna say

06:59.853 --> 07:03.857
"tired," but, like,
cute tired, not crappy tired.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.559
(both chuckle)

07:05.593 --> 07:07.094
Thank you. Uh...

07:07.127 --> 07:10.531
Hey, I-I got to get
back to it, but, uh...

07:10.564 --> 07:12.766
uh, we, we should,
we should have dinner later.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.001
Dinner.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.202
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.537
Okay. All right.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.605
Have fun.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.206
(both chuckle)

07:19.239 --> 07:21.475
TOUR GUIDE: And that concludes
this morning's tour.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.644
Any questions?

07:23.677 --> 07:26.146
A ton.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.118
(elevator bell dings)
So do we know what
this is about?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.754
New information coming
out of Planetary Defense.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.723
White House
wants to be briefed.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.924
Who are they sending?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.626
CLAIRE:
Hold that, please.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.729
Harris.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.096
Claire.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.898
Been a long time.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.938
This is Grace Barrows.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.673
Press Secretary DoD.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.074
Nice to meet you in person.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.809
Claire Rayburn, senior
advisor to the president.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.210
Of course.
Nice to meet you.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.646
(elevator bell dings)

08:00.948 --> 08:03.150
So, the president has asked
for an update on where we are,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.686
and advice on the best course
of action moving forward.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.688
Dr. Strauss, I understand
you have a revised plan.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.757
Walk us through
the latest.

08:09.790 --> 08:14.294
Our plan is still to repurpose
the IO Probe orbiting Jupiter

08:14.327 --> 08:16.063
as a kinetic impactor.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.698
Put the probe on a collision
course with the asteroid.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.866
Correct.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.000
The asteroid is poised to hit

08:20.033 --> 08:21.168
in 174 days.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.302
But now we know

08:22.335 --> 08:24.071
there are two windows
of opportunity

08:24.104 --> 08:26.640
in which the probe can actually
intercept the asteroid.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.677
The first window
is in exactly seven days,

08:29.710 --> 08:31.545
the second, in 63.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.716
What results can we expect?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.918
We've run thousands
of computer simulations,

08:37.951 --> 08:40.020
and confidence
is high that upon impact,

08:40.053 --> 08:42.723
the asteroid will break up
into smaller fragments

08:42.756 --> 08:45.058
downgrading it from
an extinction-level event.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.196
But?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.198
But...

08:51.231 --> 08:52.833
the impact will also create

08:52.866 --> 08:56.570
a storm of smaller meteors
headed directly for Earth.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.173
Where, exactly?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.810
Our calculations show
the impactor

09:02.843 --> 09:04.912
will slow the asteroid down
by .002 percent,

09:04.945 --> 09:06.346
causing those fragments

09:06.379 --> 09:09.116
to miss the Western Hemisphere
completely.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.318
But they will
land somewhere.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.021
Yes. Russia, China, Mongolia.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.157
They could all be leveled.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.663
(all murmuring)

09:22.696 --> 09:24.765
That's a billion people.
Maybe more.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.834
GRACE: Which is why Darius
has been working day and night

09:26.867 --> 09:28.268
on the EM drive.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.837
It can launch a gravity tractor
with enough speed

09:29.870 --> 09:31.138
to reach the asteroid,

09:31.171 --> 09:32.973
and enough mass
to pull it off course,

09:33.006 --> 09:35.643
missing the Earth by
thousands of miles.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.344
But he's yet to prove
his plan can work.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.848
So we're gonna sacrifice
a billion lives

09:40.881 --> 09:42.850
before even giving him
the chance to save us all?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.117
I mean, at the very least,

09:44.151 --> 09:45.653
shouldn't we wait
for the second window?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.788
Waiting gives us only
one bite at the apple.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.023
STRAUSS:
The deputy secretary's correct.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.792
We've never tried anything
like this.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.061
There's no guarantee that
we get it right the first time.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.129
If we commit to this,

09:56.163 --> 09:58.732
there's no going back.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.736
Dr. Strauss, we have seven days

10:02.770 --> 10:04.905
before we need to
put the plan in motion?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.339
That's correct.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.841
(sighs)

10:07.875 --> 10:10.744
Ms. Barrows, tell Darius Tanz
he has six days.

10:10.778 --> 10:13.346
I need to see an EM drive
proof of concept before then.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.215
Short of that, I will recommend
to the president

10:15.248 --> 10:17.751
that we move forward
with the impactor plan,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.352
seven days from now.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.956
And God help us all.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.961
(all murmuring)

10:36.837 --> 10:38.839
*

10:49.783 --> 10:52.920
Your press liaison seems awfully
empowered to speak her mind

10:52.953 --> 10:54.855
to the Deputy Secretary
of Defense.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.323
Grace's point was valid,

10:56.356 --> 10:58.058
and she's there to
counterbalance

10:58.091 --> 10:59.760
the wonks and
military types.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.228
Like you and me.

11:01.261 --> 11:05.065
Frankly, I'm surprised she even
has clearance to be there.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.834
What are you
getting at, Claire?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.368
(scoffs) Come on,
I've been in

11:08.401 --> 11:10.337
God knows how many meetings
with you, Harris.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.872
You don't give anyone
that much sway

11:11.905 --> 11:13.006
once you've made
your stance known.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.842
Okay, Grace and I
are professionals,

11:14.875 --> 11:16.076
that's all there
is to discuss.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.945
Glad to hear that.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.413
(door closes)

11:20.447 --> 11:22.149
I'm seeking a friend...

11:22.182 --> 11:23.851
for the end of the world.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.821
I hoped we could help
each other with that.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.923
Like the old days.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.093
Yeah, the old days
ruined my marriage.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.962
It's a new day,

11:34.995 --> 11:38.298
any you're not married
anymore.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.101
Look, Claire, I'm...
I'm sorry, but I can't.

11:41.134 --> 11:45.138
Now, I don't mean to be
abrupt, but I have some...

11:45.172 --> 11:47.274
I have some family
business to attend to.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.142
Of course.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.244
But if you
change your mind,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.480
you know where
to find me.

11:57.450 --> 12:01.321
(door opens, closes)

12:01.354 --> 12:03.423
LIAM:
Why is Jillian here?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.025
I thought you'd be happy.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.093
Well, I am.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.294
Then what's the problem?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.428
It's a distraction.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.497
Really? See, I thought it
was more of a distraction

12:10.530 --> 12:12.232
when you were taking
detours to her bookstore

12:12.265 --> 12:15.235
to catch a loving glimpse of her
through a window.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.371
I need your head in
the game; that means

12:18.405 --> 12:20.874
I want everything you care
about under one roof: mine.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.442
Now, what did she want?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.245
Who?
Your reporter friend
from the Embassy Ball.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.147
An interview with you.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.449
I hate how you know everything
and reveal nothing.

12:29.482 --> 12:33.120
Work it out in therapy.
Now, get back to work.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.258
Grace Barrows is here.
Says it's urgent.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.462
They call me insane?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.197
Those trigger-happy bastards.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.133
How long did it take them

12:46.166 --> 12:47.334
to condemn a billion people?

12:47.367 --> 12:49.069
A minute, a minute and a half?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.138
Look, if you can deliver proof
of concept in six days...

12:51.171 --> 12:52.439
Six days?

12:52.472 --> 12:54.774
(laughs): Six.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.412
Do you know
what this is?

12:59.446 --> 13:01.314
The first working drone
prototype I built for

13:01.348 --> 13:03.316
the United States government,
or what's left of it.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.885
Looks like it
crashed and burned.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.987
Yes, the first time,
but it worked eventually.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.121
All I needed was time.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.356
In six days, I can give you

13:09.389 --> 13:10.891
smashed metal.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.993
In-in 60 days,

13:13.026 --> 13:14.127
I can save the planet!

13:14.161 --> 13:16.563
I'm trying to keep their
fingers off the trigger, Darius,

13:16.596 --> 13:18.932
but you don't have 60 days,
you have six.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.902
You have to find a way
to buy us more time.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.603
How?
Well, that's for
you to figure out.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.306
Excuse me, I've done
what you asked.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.209
I got you uranium, which could
still come back to haunt me.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.510
That's behind us,
this is in front of us.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.914
Grace, if the IO Probe
hits that asteroid,

13:33.947 --> 13:37.417
life as we know it is over.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.555
Wait, where are you going?
Lunch.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.560
(door buzzing)

13:51.631 --> 13:53.400
(sighs) No.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.307
Assault?
Resisting arrest?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.875
Destruction of
government property?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.276
It was a peaceful protest.

14:03.310 --> 14:04.377
Until it wasn't.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.280
This is not just
some rebellion, Dad,

14:07.314 --> 14:09.282
I'm actually trying
to save the world.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.418
(scoffs) Okay.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.453
Well, you aren't going to
do it from a jail cell.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.888
Now let's get out of here.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.123
What about my friends?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.257
What about them?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.959
They're locked up
back there.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.493
You always said
leave no man behind.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.163
Dylan, I called in a favor
to get you out of here.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.498
I'm your father,
not theirs.
Father?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.968
You're a stranger who
occasionally showed up

14:28.001 --> 14:29.369
for birthdays.
I'm a military man

14:29.402 --> 14:31.338
who got reassigned.
That's right.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.273
The military always comes first.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.975
You know what?
You have no regard

14:35.008 --> 14:36.409
for the people who
serve this country.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.445
Hey, putting their lives
on the line every day.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.647
You have no regard for my
friends who are also serving

14:40.680 --> 14:42.382
this country by putting
their lives on the line.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.416
Dylan,
I don't have time

14:43.450 --> 14:45.418
to listen...
Right!

14:45.452 --> 14:47.320
You don't have time.

14:47.354 --> 14:48.355
Look,

14:48.388 --> 14:50.523
I don't want to fight.
Well, I do!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.993
I am fighting for
what I believe in.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.328
I just wish once
you could respect that!

14:55.362 --> 14:58.165
Okay, fine.
You want to stay?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.233
More power to you.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.501
(door buzzes)

15:09.309 --> 15:11.178
Best food truck
in the city.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.949
How's your, um,
beet cashew taco?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.617
Yeah, about as good
as you said it was

15:17.650 --> 15:19.586
in that Forbes exclusive
you did last year,

15:19.619 --> 15:21.454
"The Elites' Best Eats."

15:21.488 --> 15:23.723
That's what
you're reading?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.492
Tragic.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.461
Well, at the risk of sounding
like a pathetic fan,

15:28.495 --> 15:31.264
I've pretty much read everything
published about you.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.433
That's funny, because I've read
pretty much everything

15:33.466 --> 15:36.036
published by you.
(chuckles) No.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.471
"She always managed
to outrun fate,

15:38.505 --> 15:41.408
"to cheat death,
but now she was

15:41.441 --> 15:42.742
"over two light-years
from home,

15:42.775 --> 15:45.012
"trapped alone on the
shadow side of a planet

15:45.045 --> 15:47.647
that as yet
had no name."

15:47.680 --> 15:50.683
You read my book.
ShadowSide.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.186
And now you're
quoting from it.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.287
Quite a strong sense
of individualism,

15:54.321 --> 15:58.525
self-determination, but
above all else, humanity.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.064
Who are your
influences?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.365
Well, I'm a big Asimov fan.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.300
Heinlein, of course.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.402
Uh...
What about Bartok?

16:10.803 --> 16:14.407
Andre Bartok?
Um...

16:14.441 --> 16:16.443
Too dystopian
for my taste.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.445
Surprising, considering
your connection to him.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.148
He's your... grandfather,
if I'm not mistaken?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.618
Mr. Tanz, what am I doing here
having lunch with you?

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
If you want to meet
my grandfather...

16:27.354 --> 16:29.789
No, on the contrary.
I have a proposition.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.658
For you.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.561
(knocks on door)

16:34.594 --> 16:36.529
HARRIS:
Don't you think I tried?

16:36.563 --> 16:37.664
This is on Dylan, Monica.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.099
You know what? I'm sorry.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.068
There's nothing left to discuss.
(phone beeps)

16:41.101 --> 16:42.469
What happened with Dylan?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.404
I'm handling it.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.739
What did you find out?
From Darius?

16:46.773 --> 16:49.109
He needs more time.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.778
(scoffs) Well, that's
something we don't have.

16:51.811 --> 16:55.115
Unless... we wait for
the second window.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.485
Grace, that gives us only
one chance to get things right.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.586
Do you think for one minute

16:59.619 --> 17:02.189
if Russia or China
had this information,

17:02.222 --> 17:03.590
they wouldn't protect
their own interests?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.259
Who are we to play God?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.428
To kill a billion people
just so we can...

17:08.461 --> 17:09.496
Save the rest of the planet?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.431
Save ourselves,
is what you mean.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.534
(scoffs) Is that what
you think of me?

17:15.602 --> 17:19.072
That I'm some sort
of monster?
What?

17:19.106 --> 17:21.241
No.
No. You just...

17:21.274 --> 17:23.110
you just stand there
in judgment.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.845
Never having had to make
life and death decisions.

17:25.878 --> 17:29.149
Harris, this is
the biggest one yet.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.583
How can you be so sure
of yourself?

17:30.617 --> 17:33.353
And how can you be
so damn sure of Darius Tanz?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.256
Because the alternative
is unacceptable!

17:37.457 --> 17:40.627
And maybe you're done
fighting, but I'm not.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.601
(sighs)

17:57.344 --> 17:59.312
(phone beeps)

18:03.716 --> 18:06.419
Hi, it's Grace Barrows.
Can we meet?

18:08.188 --> 18:10.490
No. Alone.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.462
Damn it.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.564
Darius is right.
Respectfully, sir,

18:17.597 --> 18:20.167
we need bigger
and bolder moves.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.401
When people say

18:21.434 --> 18:22.769
"respectfully," I find
that they're actually

18:22.802 --> 18:24.637
being disrespectful.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.140
Do you even understand what
we're trying to do here, Liam?

18:27.174 --> 18:28.641
Yeah. We're trying
to save the world

18:28.675 --> 18:30.677
one painfully slow
frequency at a time.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.811
There are 300,000

18:31.844 --> 18:34.381
possible frequencies,

18:34.414 --> 18:36.649
and only one
will give us thrust.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.718
I'm doing the math in my head
here, sir, and even with this

18:38.751 --> 18:41.888
supercomputer, we do not have
enough time to check them all.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.356
Then what are you suggesting?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.225
We have to cut down
the number of frequencies.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.693
That would
cut corners.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.695
We might miss the frequency
that would save us all.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.431
In the '50s, the JPL guys
nearly blew themselves up

18:51.464 --> 18:54.567
testing rockets, now
they lead the field.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.404
What is so wrong with taking
big swings like Darius says?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.839
Because Darius Tanz is not
a scientist, he's a celebrity.

18:59.872 --> 19:03.576
And he's convinced you
and the rest of the world,

19:03.610 --> 19:05.878
with his charm and bravado,
that he knows the way.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.481
Delusional optimism is not
gonna get this thing built.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.616
We are.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.583
In the meantime, he's...

19:10.617 --> 19:12.852
at lunch with
your girlfriend.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.524
Where are you going?
To blow something up.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.692
(game beeping)

19:23.730 --> 19:26.599
So that's your secret?
Asteroids?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.768
What?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.638
You're a retro
videogame junkie?
Oh...

19:32.672 --> 19:33.940
Yeah.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.209
Yeah, I was just
taking a break from the grind.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.777
How was your lunch?

19:37.810 --> 19:39.479
Interesting.
Yeah?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.713
How interesting?

19:40.747 --> 19:42.782
(pulls lever)

19:42.815 --> 19:44.917
Are you happy to see me?
What?

19:44.951 --> 19:46.253
Beyond.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.291
Would you be happy to see
more of me?

19:51.324 --> 19:54.827
(quietly):
You have no idea.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.965
(whispers):
Darius offered me a job.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.003
What?
Yeah.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.506
He has this think tank
where he brings together

20:06.539 --> 20:07.907
authors, artists,
philosophers,

20:07.940 --> 20:11.511
and he said that I would
make a great addition.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.879
I thought you'd be happy.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.647
Don't you find it
strange that he would

20:14.681 --> 20:17.784
pluck you from obscurity,
fly you here,

20:17.817 --> 20:18.851
offer you a job...
What?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.720
Because I didn't go to MIT,
I don't belong here?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.389
No.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.523
Then what?

20:25.024 --> 20:27.694
You know what, I think I'm just
gonna go back to the hotel.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.828
No. Jillian, wait.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.731
Jillian.
Don't.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.502
(videogame beeps)

20:35.535 --> 20:37.437
You offered her a job
without consulting me?

20:37.470 --> 20:40.407
I wasn't aware I had to run
business decisions by you.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.509
This isn't business,
this is my life.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.777
If she's here, I'm gonna
have to lie to her

20:44.811 --> 20:45.812
every single day.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.580
Do you know how awful that is?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.449
Fine, fine, then tell her.
Forgetting for a minute

20:49.482 --> 20:51.451
that is a violation
of national security,

20:51.484 --> 20:52.752
I don't,
I don't want to tell her.

20:52.785 --> 20:53.786
(typing)

20:53.820 --> 20:55.021
I don't want to tell a girl

20:55.054 --> 20:57.056
that I care about
that the world is ending.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.559
Ending, maybe.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.594
Maybe? Probably.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.963
Unless I can figure out
a way to stop it somehow...

21:05.998 --> 21:07.700
She's still happy.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.837
Why should she have to carry
around this burden?
Liam...

21:10.870 --> 21:12.339
This burden sucks.
Liam,

21:12.372 --> 21:15.442
I'm carrying on as if,
and so should you.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.578
As if what? You're actually
doing something to help?

21:18.611 --> 21:19.779
'Cause last time
I checked,

21:19.812 --> 21:22.815
it is... it is me and Croft
and a bunch of your minions

21:22.849 --> 21:24.351
sweating it out in the trenches

21:24.384 --> 21:27.554
while you're out eating tacos
with my girlfriend.

21:27.587 --> 21:30.357
There are reasons
for everything I do.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.459
Oh, great. You want to fill
the rest of us in?

21:32.492 --> 21:36.829
No. I need you to
prioritize, Liam.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.366
Focus on what's important.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.502
Use your brilliance to save
the world, not second-guess me.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.970
(elevator bell dings)

21:44.003 --> 21:46.506
If you'll excuse me,
I have an appointment.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.681
(horn blaring)

21:57.984 --> 22:00.887
(footfalls approaching)

22:00.920 --> 22:02.689
Thank you for coming.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.791
A meeting this far
outside the Beltway.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.427
Should I check to see if there's
a gun taped to the toilet?

22:07.460 --> 22:10.096
Can I trust that anything
we say will stay between us?

22:10.129 --> 22:13.933
Undermining your boss
could get a person fired.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.835
You're talking about protocol.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.870
I'm talking about the fate
of the planet.

22:19.706 --> 22:20.773
DARIUS:
Thank you, Karissa.

22:20.807 --> 22:21.941
She makes the
best smoothies--

22:21.974 --> 22:23.576
all-natural,
organic, of course.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.911
Kale, coconut, lime...

22:24.944 --> 22:27.113
Picante.
Oh, I love this one.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.915
It's got a real kick.
The good kind.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.850
So, Ms. Neel.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.084
Wow. (clears throat)

22:32.118 --> 22:33.920
You're a pretty
tenacious reporter.

22:33.953 --> 22:35.822
Not many people pierce
the corporate veil here.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.957
Well, I guess Liam must have
given you the hard sell.

22:37.990 --> 22:40.660
On the contrary,
he dismissed you completely.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.531
But I'm interested in people,
why they do what they do.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.698
And people like us,

22:45.732 --> 22:47.567
when we hit a wall,

22:47.600 --> 22:48.801
we see three options:

22:48.835 --> 22:51.704
go around it, climb over it
or tunnel under.

22:51.738 --> 22:53.840
And if that doesn't work,
we blow the damn thing up.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.508
(both laugh)

22:55.542 --> 22:56.809
Now, you're obviously
after what you think

22:56.843 --> 22:58.845
could be a career-making story,

22:58.878 --> 23:00.680
so let's cut to it.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.849
What headline are you chasing?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.384
Uh, this one.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.856
Grace Barrows delivering uranium
in the middle of the night

23:09.889 --> 23:11.691
to Tanz Industries.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.960
Care to comment?

23:22.969 --> 23:26.005
Mars. That's what this is about?

23:26.038 --> 23:27.740
A joint venture
between Tanz Industries

23:27.774 --> 23:30.643
and the U.S. government,
the first of its kind.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.912
And uranium is what's
gonna get us there.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.847
Exciting, isn't it?

23:34.881 --> 23:37.149
Sending astronauts to Mars?
Very exciting.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.819
Who said anything
about astronauts?

23:39.852 --> 23:42.822
My team has written
a complex algorithm

23:42.855 --> 23:45.157
that-that takes into account
a person's entire genome,

23:45.191 --> 23:47.727
factoring in personality
and viability traits

23:47.760 --> 23:49.496
to ensure that we get

23:49.529 --> 23:51.764
the best of the best.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.768
So, you're selecting civilians
for the first mission to Mars?

23:55.802 --> 23:58.905
"Tanz Seeks Candidates
for Journey to Red Planet."

23:58.938 --> 24:00.106
(both chuckle)

24:00.139 --> 24:01.841
And what do I have to do

24:01.874 --> 24:03.976
in exchange
for this exclusive story?

24:04.010 --> 24:08.881
Proprietary information, such
as where I get my materials--

24:08.915 --> 24:10.717
uranium, for example--

24:10.750 --> 24:12.184
belongs to
Tanz Industries.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.521
So, if you were
to publish photographs

24:14.554 --> 24:16.255
like the ones
you just showed me,

24:16.288 --> 24:18.525
my lawyers wouldn't
take kindly to that,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.893
nor would the United
States government.

24:20.927 --> 24:23.195
So...

24:23.229 --> 24:25.264
if you would like a
career-making exclusive,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.734
I would suggest
you sign this

24:27.767 --> 24:31.203
and hand over
those photographs.

24:31.237 --> 24:36.008
And this has nothing
to do with Project Atlas?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.210
Project Atlas?
Never heard of it.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.779
Sorry. My mistake.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.080
Where do I sign?

24:43.883 --> 24:45.217
(pen scribbling)

24:45.251 --> 24:47.219
(thunder rumbles)

24:47.253 --> 24:49.856
CLAIRE: I appreciate your faith
in Darius Tanz,

24:49.889 --> 24:51.157
but you don't know
with certainty

24:51.190 --> 24:52.792
that he and his team
can pull off

24:52.825 --> 24:53.893
the EM drive in 60 days.

24:53.926 --> 24:54.961
I know that we
have to give

24:54.994 --> 24:57.263
great minds the time to
come up with a solution

24:57.296 --> 24:59.799
that doesn't compromise
our moral fabric.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.302
Are you familiar
with Greek mythology?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.271
I dabbled in college.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.808
Then you may remember the story
of Scylla and Charybdis.

25:08.841 --> 25:12.311
Two mythical monsters.
Is this a test?

25:12.344 --> 25:16.215
Odysseus had to steer his ship
through a narrow strait

25:16.248 --> 25:19.752
and confront Scylla
or Charybdis.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.320
Scylla would snatch
six people from his ship.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.122
Charybdis was a whirlpool

25:23.155 --> 25:26.325
that could destroy them all or
they might all make it through.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.828
Odysseus made the choice
to sacrifice

25:28.861 --> 25:31.764
six sailors rather than
risk the whole ship.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.767
Sometimes there are
no good choices, Grace.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.136
But the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.337
So, we should just
destroy others

25:38.370 --> 25:40.707
to preserve our way of life?

25:40.740 --> 25:42.008
Decide who lives or dies.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.876
I can't understand how
you can be so cavalier.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.813
(quietly):
You think I'm cavalier?

25:46.846 --> 25:49.015
You think I want to be
facing this reality?

25:49.048 --> 25:52.018
Telling the President
of the United States

25:52.051 --> 25:54.754
that our best option
is to destroy a few countries

25:54.787 --> 25:55.855
in order to save our own?

25:59.025 --> 26:00.627
Do you have kids?

26:00.660 --> 26:03.863
(sighs) No.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.836
I have a daughter.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.204
She's 18. She just...

26:12.238 --> 26:13.973
graduated from high school.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.009
She's...

26:18.044 --> 26:19.712
She's beautiful.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.614
Every day when I look
into her eyes,

26:21.648 --> 26:24.116
I feel a responsibility
to do right by her.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.020
Give Darius the time he needs.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.956
Recommend the second window

26:29.989 --> 26:31.991
and maybe then we can save
the entire planet.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.269
CROFT: Prioritize?
That's what he said?

26:43.302 --> 26:45.004
LIAM:
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.939
I need to prioritize; he's
in there giving an interview.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.908
Why is he such a prick?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.209
That's rhetorical, I gather.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.711
LIAM:
No, it's not.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.012
I want to know.
Tess, you there?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.180
TESS:
Yes, Liam.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.015
Why is Darius
such a prick?

26:56.048 --> 26:57.717
Not sure I understand
the question.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.885
Yes, you do.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.053
You just don't want
to answer it.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.255
Tess, how many frequencies
are left?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.925
TESS:
There are 287,109

27:05.958 --> 27:07.193
frequencies remaining.
Oh, my...

27:07.226 --> 27:09.061
Well, it's a marathon;
it's not a sprint.

27:09.095 --> 27:10.930
Yeah, whatever it is,
it's a race without a winner.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.733
Well, we have to vet
the losers to find the winner.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.802
Yeah, but not all losers
are created equal.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.940
Maybe we do have
to prioritize.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.174
Huh?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.210
In a marathon, you may
have 30,000 runners.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.913
Some have a better chance
of winning than others.
Hmm.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.016
If we could prioritize
the frequencies...

27:30.049 --> 27:32.084
narrow it down to those
most likely to win the race,

27:32.118 --> 27:34.153
eliminate those who never
stood a chance off the top.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.822
Well, how are we
gonna do that?
Tess.

27:35.855 --> 27:39.025
Tess, you have
predictive algorithms, right?

27:39.058 --> 27:41.060
TESS: Of course, it helps me
anticipate Darius's needs.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.796
And you have access
to our EM drive research?

27:43.830 --> 27:46.432
I have access to all
of Darius and Malcolm Croft's

27:46.465 --> 27:48.835
nonworking prototypes.
LIAM: Can you use

27:48.868 --> 27:50.837
those predictive algorithms
to analyze those failures

27:50.870 --> 27:52.805
and then prioritize
which frequencies

27:52.839 --> 27:55.007
have the best chance
of producing thrust? Please?

27:55.041 --> 27:56.308
I can try, Liam.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.443
You want her to guess?

27:57.476 --> 27:59.245
To make an educated guess.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.781
We do not have time to eliminate
300,000 frequencies.

28:01.814 --> 28:05.284
Tess will narrow our field
of competitors fast.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.424
(distant siren wailing)

28:12.458 --> 28:17.964
Ed, I got an exclusive with
Darius Tanz on his Mars project.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.231
How much do you love me?

28:19.265 --> 28:21.000
(chuckles)

28:21.033 --> 28:24.003
I didn't get anywhere on Atlas,
but don't worry.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.238
I'm not dropping
that white whale.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.907
Yeah, you know me.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.442
I like to keep pulling threads.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.279
Eventually, something
or someone will unravel.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.047
(knocking on door)

28:36.949 --> 28:39.251
Hi.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.087
Um, I'm sorry.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.889
I tried calling, texting.

28:42.922 --> 28:46.225
Oh, uh, yeah.
I-I was out.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.427
Can we talk?

28:50.963 --> 28:52.164
So, you left him there?

28:52.198 --> 28:55.134
Dylan's right.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.769
I'm a terrible father.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.404
I don't believe that.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.275
'Cause you see
the best in me.

29:03.309 --> 29:06.212
No, I just see you.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.184
Go back to Dylan.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.053
Make amends.

29:14.086 --> 29:19.358
You can't change the past,
but you can change the future.

29:19.391 --> 29:22.128
What's left of it.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.335
Grace.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.474
I know we don't agree.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.079
But I have to do
what I think is right.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.051
That's all any
of us can do.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.531
(computer trilling)

30:02.401 --> 30:06.072
TESS:
Liam, you have a match.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.874
What?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.141
You have a match.

30:09.175 --> 30:11.543
LIAM:
Oh, Tess.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.280
Tess, you beautiful,
beautiful, red machine.

30:14.313 --> 30:16.382
Croft, wake up.
(camera clicks)

30:16.415 --> 30:18.284
Please don't be dead.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.551
(stammers)

30:19.585 --> 30:21.220
She found a match.
Tess found a match.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.388
What?
Come on!

30:26.258 --> 30:28.260
*

30:32.298 --> 30:34.300
(quietly):
Okay.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.274
(shouts) Those
stairs are tricky.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.944
Professor.
Yeah?

30:44.977 --> 30:47.546
We have thrust.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.148
(laughs):
Yeah, we have thrust.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.316
We have thrust.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.317
We have thrust.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.551
We have thrust!

30:52.584 --> 30:54.253
(both shout)

30:54.286 --> 30:55.454
Mwah. We have thrust!

30:55.487 --> 30:57.156
We've got thrust.
(laughs)

30:57.189 --> 30:58.624
Oh, my God.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.259
I knew you bastards
would figure it out.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.328
So, Tess prioritized
the frequencies

31:02.361 --> 31:04.931
and we did it.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.298
Yeah, we did.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.167
Now we just have
to build the damn thing.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.902
The Pentagon wants to
see a fully functional

31:09.936 --> 31:12.038
scale model in 48 hours.
CROFT: No.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.206
That's impossible.
Malcolm,

31:14.240 --> 31:15.574
you just defied
Newton's third law.

31:15.607 --> 31:16.943
Anything's possible.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.277
We'll need all
hands on deck.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.212
Seriously?

31:20.246 --> 31:22.514
I said all hands, didn't I?

31:22.548 --> 31:24.917
So, you achieved thrust.
Now show me how.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.118
LIAM:
Yeah, okay.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.921
(phone vibrating)

31:31.257 --> 31:33.259
It's Darius.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.231
"Good news.
Ready for show-and-tell."

31:39.265 --> 31:41.667
(exhales) They
did it, Harris.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.270
They have proof of concept.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.375
Oh, I had long given up on this.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.378
Too bad it only took the end of
the world for us to crack it.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.947
I'd say that's
perfect timing.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.249
Here, Professor.
Need to get you out of sight

31:57.283 --> 31:58.484
if you're concerned
about your safety.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.418
CROFT:
Uh...

31:59.451 --> 32:01.387
Don't forget,
don't overload the system.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.721
Got it.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.190
We did good, Mr. Cole.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.657
Professor.
(chuckles)

32:05.691 --> 32:07.994
Uh, all right, all right.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.263
(exhales)

32:11.297 --> 32:13.499
A hiker in the desert is limited

32:13.532 --> 32:15.968
by the amount of water
he can carry.

32:16.002 --> 32:19.038
But what if he could
make water as he went?

32:19.071 --> 32:22.308
Our EM drive will
allow us to make our own

32:22.341 --> 32:24.076
metaphorical water.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.344
We'll be able
to travel at speeds

32:25.377 --> 32:27.213
ten times what we're
capable of now.

32:27.246 --> 32:30.316
The thrust it will
generate is-is tiny--

32:30.349 --> 32:33.185
less than one thousandth of
a Newton, but it's constant.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.321
In the vacuum of space, that is
better than a fleet of rockets.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.156
If this little guy moves

32:37.189 --> 32:39.058
even one millimeter,

32:39.091 --> 32:40.292
it'll be one of
the greatest triumphs

32:40.326 --> 32:42.628
in scientific history.

32:42.661 --> 32:46.032
And maybe, just maybe...

32:46.065 --> 32:47.299
the savior of mankind.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.268
With the deadline
three hours from now,

32:49.301 --> 32:51.270
there's only been time
to test computer models.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.339
We haven't had a chance
to field test it

32:53.372 --> 32:56.542
in the real world, so...
without further ado.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.282
(power whirring)

33:06.085 --> 33:08.320
What are we looking at, exactly?

33:08.354 --> 33:11.557
At the moment, nothing.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.359
(quietly):
What's happening?

33:13.392 --> 33:14.793
Well, we have frequency lock.
It should be working now.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.762
Send more power.
But Croft warned...

33:16.795 --> 33:18.197
I don't care what Croft said.

33:18.230 --> 33:19.431
This is do-or-die time.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.666
Do it.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.102
(taps key)

33:23.135 --> 33:25.404
(power whirring)

33:30.709 --> 33:32.378
(whirring grows louder)

33:42.454 --> 33:44.490
(sizzling)

33:47.559 --> 33:48.660
(sighs)

33:48.694 --> 33:50.496
I think we've
seen enough here.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.548
(scoffs) I told you
not to push it, damn it.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.417
Darius told me
to send more power.

34:11.450 --> 34:13.419
Nothing was happening.
We needed to improvise.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.687
Improvise? We just figured
out how to make it work,

34:15.721 --> 34:17.323
and you want
to improvise?

34:17.356 --> 34:19.158
That's how things get done.
Croft's right.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.692
You're not a scientist,
you're a celebrity.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.195
(chuckles)
Is that right?

34:23.229 --> 34:24.430
And now, because
I listened to you,

34:24.463 --> 34:27.499
our last chance to save our
collective asses has literally

34:27.533 --> 34:29.301
gone up in flames.

34:29.335 --> 34:30.636
You say you have
a reason for everything.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.371
I sure as hell hope
you have one for this.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.440
Where are you going?
To make things right.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.742
While I still can.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.187
HARRIS: We need to make
the call to the president.

34:48.220 --> 34:53.392
Maybe we should
consider the second window.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.227
What?

34:55.261 --> 34:56.495
Did you not just
see what happened

34:56.528 --> 34:58.464
with Darius and
his fantasy technology?

34:58.497 --> 35:01.133
It worked in the
computer simulation.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.135
It was a simulation, Claire.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.504
Maybe all they
really need is time.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.839
Time is a luxury we don't have.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.444
Who got to you?
Was it Darius?

35:12.478 --> 35:14.112
No.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.549
Someone else.

35:24.590 --> 35:25.224
(door closes)

35:25.257 --> 35:27.726
You broke chain of command.

35:27.759 --> 35:30.596
Went behind my back.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.598
I did what I thought was right.

35:36.568 --> 35:39.271
I guess you thought
this was right, too.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.839
I believe this is yours.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.474
(softly):
Oh, my God.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.910
I thought it was
an accident at first.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.545
Maybe it got caught
on my clothes,

35:46.578 --> 35:48.314
fell into the briefcase.

35:48.347 --> 35:52.584
That's before I knew how far
you were willing to go.

35:52.618 --> 35:54.620
Just how far did you go, Grace?

35:54.653 --> 35:56.455
Right now, that doesn't matter.
It does to me.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.789
What did you do?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.425
I don't want to compromise you.

35:59.458 --> 36:02.561
Damn it, Grace,
you already have.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.363
You know that under
normal circumstances,

36:04.396 --> 36:05.864
I would never do some
of the things I've done.

36:05.897 --> 36:09.535
You've made your
choices, Grace.

36:09.568 --> 36:10.802
Now I need to make mine.

36:13.639 --> 36:17.376
(door opens, closes)

36:21.780 --> 36:23.682
(door closes)

36:29.355 --> 36:31.690
Hey. Hey, thanks
for coming.

36:31.723 --> 36:34.526
Yeah, you still look...
Terrible, I know.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.363
Work's been, uh...
it's been rough.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.598
I'm sorry.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.000
No, I'm sorry.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.403
I really am. Uh...

36:44.436 --> 36:47.539
A job offer from Darius
is an opportunity.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.475
If the job excites you,
you should take it.

36:49.508 --> 36:52.378
I already did.

36:53.679 --> 36:57.983
That's, uh... that's fantastic.

36:58.016 --> 37:00.352
Is it?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.754
I want you to be happy.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.990
I'm-I'm sorry.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.332
So, uh, what's
the project, exactly?

37:13.365 --> 37:15.734
You know how Darius wants
to colonize Mars?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.969
Yeah.
Basically,

37:18.003 --> 37:20.839
we're figuring out
the first step, so the minimum

37:20.872 --> 37:22.441
BOTH:
...viable population.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.443
Jinx.
(chuckles)

37:24.476 --> 37:27.613
You're, uh...
you're selecting 160 people

37:27.646 --> 37:28.780
for an ark.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.449
Well, a hypothetical ark.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.750
Who would you choose
to repopulate

37:31.783 --> 37:34.019
if you knew the world was
coming to an end?

37:34.052 --> 37:36.555
And it's weird
because he said that

37:36.588 --> 37:38.557
this project is
a priority.

37:41.827 --> 37:45.397
Well... Darius has
a reason for everything.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.266
(chuckles nervously)

37:49.635 --> 37:51.337
(door buzzes)

37:51.370 --> 37:53.572
(indistinct chatter
over speaker)

37:56.342 --> 37:57.943
MAN: Housing unit,
please see guard tower.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.948
What are you doing here?

38:02.981 --> 38:05.384
I'm here to bail you out.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.419
And your friends.
Yeah.

38:07.453 --> 38:08.854
They all left.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.956
As soon as they had
the chance, they took it.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.629
It's a fundamental
human instinct...

38:17.663 --> 38:20.766
to act in favor
of self-preservation.

38:22.701 --> 38:25.604
People can be so
disappointing, you know?

38:25.637 --> 38:28.674
(sighs) I do.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.979
I don't want to
disappoint you anymore.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.418
I can't change
the past, Dylan.

38:39.451 --> 38:43.755
But I want to change,
be a better father.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.559
Before it's too late.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.649
(phone rings)

39:17.456 --> 39:19.057
Yes, I understand.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.892
Thank you.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.694
(sighs)

39:25.096 --> 39:27.466
The president has
given the order.

39:27.499 --> 39:28.767
We are a go.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.903
MAN:
Commencing burn on the IO Probe.

39:31.937 --> 39:35.841
(excited chatter)

39:35.874 --> 39:37.843
And we just condemned
a billion people.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.017
Switching to IO Probe view now.
Status?

39:46.051 --> 39:49.488
NASA's standing by,
ready to initiate final burn.

39:49.521 --> 39:52.591
(excited chatter)

39:57.062 --> 39:57.929
Proceed.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.565
STRAUSS:
Roger that.

39:59.598 --> 40:03.001
NASA, Samson.
Initiate thrust.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.971
MAN:
Thrust initiated.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.540
The probe is exiting orbit.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.013
Trajectory has been
adjusted for impact.

40:15.046 --> 40:16.515
MAN:
Trajectory confirmed, Samson.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.984
Switching to forward camera.

40:25.256 --> 40:28.694
On course for impact.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.034
Samson, we are looking good.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.078
(phone vibrates)

40:51.583 --> 40:53.051
(alarm beeping)

40:53.084 --> 40:54.085
TECH: Sir, we
have a problem.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.087
The probe's engines
are firing.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.589
MAN: Samson, trajectory
has been changed.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.224
We are no longer on course.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.026
What's going on?

41:01.059 --> 41:03.795
I don't know. The thrusters have
been activated at full strength.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.897
HARRIS:
NASA, Samson.

41:05.931 --> 41:08.600
A 100% burn on IO
has been initiated. Is that you?

41:08.634 --> 41:09.935
NASA TECH:
Negative, Samson.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.670
That is not us.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.974
Who the hell is sending
this command?
I don't know.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.009
Could this be
instrumentation failure?

41:18.043 --> 41:20.211
Negative. Command is coming
from another signal.

41:20.245 --> 41:21.847
Harris, what the hell
is going on?

41:28.119 --> 41:30.121
Probe is no longer
responding to us.

41:30.155 --> 41:33.525
MAN: The probe is receiving
commands from somewhere else.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.029
I need one explanation now.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.165
STRAUSS: I have only
one possible explanation.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.167
We've been hacked, sir.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.270
NASA has been hacked.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.173
MAN: Samson, are you getting
a read on the signal location?

41:48.206 --> 41:49.875
Samson?

41:49.908 --> 41:51.309
I need reports on China,
Russia, Iran.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.277
I'm on it.
Also,

41:52.310 --> 41:54.913
get me intel
on any hacker group activity.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.014
(phone ringing)

41:56.047 --> 41:57.683
The president.

41:57.716 --> 41:58.684
(phone ringing)

41:58.717 --> 41:59.885
HARRIS:
If there's a leak--

41:59.918 --> 42:02.020
someone who might have
given aid to hackers

42:02.053 --> 42:03.288
or an outside
foreign entity,

42:03.321 --> 42:05.223
we need to find the mole.

42:05.256 --> 42:08.794
Figure out who had the means
and motive to do this, now.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.596
MAN: The list is
coming up right now.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.334
DARIUS: People like us,
when we hit a wall,

42:16.367 --> 42:20.772
we see three options:
go around it, climb over it

42:20.806 --> 42:22.040
or tunnel under.
And if that doesn't work,

42:22.073 --> 42:23.074
we blow the damn thing up.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.743
(Darius and Amanda chuckle)

42:24.776 --> 42:26.978
If you would like
a career-making exclusive,

42:27.012 --> 42:29.147
I would suggest you sign this.

42:29.180 --> 42:32.117
AMANDA: And this has nothing
to do with Project Atlas?

42:32.150 --> 42:33.318
DARIUS:
Project Atlas...

42:36.788 --> 42:38.924
MAN:
Our reporter friend?

42:38.957 --> 42:40.826
She got the message.

42:42.027 --> 42:43.061
DARIUS: You've reached
the personal voicemail

42:43.094 --> 42:44.295
of Darius Tanz.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.031
If you have this number,

42:46.064 --> 42:47.265
it's because
you're very important to me.

42:47.298 --> 42:49.801
So please leave
a detailed message.

42:49.835 --> 42:51.036
(line beeps)

42:51.069 --> 42:52.704
Darius, where are you?

42:52.738 --> 42:54.105
I need to know what you did.
