00:26.935 --> 00:28.519
Guardian of the universe.

00:28.604 --> 00:30.354
Protecting us against the forces of evil.

00:30.439 --> 00:31.564
The superpowers of this man...

00:31.648 --> 00:32.648
He can catch a bullet,

00:32.732 --> 00:33.983
halt a speeding train.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.485
And leap tall buildings in a single bound.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.279
- Up in the sky...
- Is it a bird?

00:38.822 --> 00:40.114
A mailman by day...

00:40.198 --> 00:41.699
City's guardian by night.

00:41.783 --> 00:44.952
Defending the citizens of New York
from the forces of evil.

00:45.037 --> 00:48.247
The world has been protected
by a group of extraordinary men and women

00:48.332 --> 00:50.333
who have dedicated themselves
to fighting crime.

00:50.417 --> 00:52.418
Mysterious traveler from another dimension.

00:52.502 --> 00:56.714
He has powers far beyond
the capabilities of mere earthlings.

01:07.809 --> 01:10.811
I always wondered
why nobody did it before me.

01:12.940 --> 01:16.233
I mean, all those comic books,
movies, TV shows,

01:16.777 --> 01:21.072
you'd think that one eccentric Ioner
would have made himself a costume.

01:22.658 --> 01:25.534
I mean, is everyday life really so exciting?

01:25.827 --> 01:27.662
Are schools and offices so thrilling

01:27.746 --> 01:29.956
that I'm the only one
who ever fantasized about this?

01:32.084 --> 01:33.668
Come on, be honest with yourself.

01:34.878 --> 01:38.506
At some point in our lives,
we all wanted to be a superhero.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.732
That's not me, by the way.

01:57.192 --> 02:01.237
That's some Armenian guy
with a history of mental health problems.

02:01.947 --> 02:05.074
Who am I? I'm Kick-Ass.

02:15.168 --> 02:18.796
That's me,
back before any of this crazy shit happened.

02:19.965 --> 02:23.968
I guess I was the last person
you'd expect to become a superhero.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.680
I'm not saying
there was anything wrong with me,

02:27.764 --> 02:30.266
but there was nothing special, either.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.685
- Asshole.
- I wasn't into sports.

02:32.769 --> 02:35.354
I wasn't a mathlete or a hardcore gamer.

02:36.189 --> 02:39.108
I didn't have a piercing
or an eating disorder

02:39.192 --> 02:41.318
or 3,000 friends on MySpace.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.156
My only superpower
was being invisible to girls.

02:46.199 --> 02:49.702
And out of my friends, man,
I wasn't even the funny one.

02:50.287 --> 02:53.080
Like most people my age, I just existed.

03:04.092 --> 03:05.676
Good morning, class.

03:05.761 --> 03:09.180
Please open your books to Act 2, Scene 2.

03:10.265 --> 03:13.642
Kick in my bedroom door,
and you'd probably find me watching TV

03:14.311 --> 03:16.020
or talking to my friend Todd on Skype...

03:16.104 --> 03:18.689
- Are you watching Family Guy?
- Nope.

03:18.774 --> 03:22.651
Me, either. Check out nippleslip. Com.
It's good.

03:26.031 --> 03:29.116
...or jerking off,
mostly to my English teacher.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.203
Dave Lizewski.

03:32.287 --> 03:35.956
Don't think I haven't noticed
you looking at my tits, Dave.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.294
I want your hands all over me, Dave.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.796
Please.

03:43.131 --> 03:45.674
Sure, a lot of what got me
through the average school day

03:45.759 --> 03:49.220
was making deposits
in the whack-off warehouse for later.

03:49.304 --> 03:51.180
Though to be honest,

03:51.264 --> 03:53.099
it didn't take much to set me off.

03:54.392 --> 03:57.061
I swear, when my hormones balance out,

03:57.145 --> 03:59.438
shares in Kleenex
are gonna take a dive, man.

04:03.652 --> 04:07.238
Dave Lizewski, shouldn't you be looking
at Hamlet right now?

04:07.656 --> 04:08.906
Yes, Mrs. Zane.

04:11.201 --> 04:12.535
I'm sorry.

04:13.787 --> 04:17.164
But don't get me wrong.
I like girls my own age, too.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.041
Especially Katie Deauxma.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.127
Hey, gorgeous.

04:21.837 --> 04:22.920
Hey.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.508
Oh, no.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.972
You meant Erika. I know. I knew that.

04:33.181 --> 04:34.682
I was just kidding.

04:35.183 --> 04:36.725
Okay, cool.

04:37.394 --> 04:38.811
Oh, my God.

04:42.941 --> 04:44.984
Hey. Look, I'm Todd's mom.

04:47.529 --> 04:49.530
That's funny. This is your dad.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.533
No, that's still my mom, actually.

04:54.411 --> 04:55.870
What the fuck!

04:56.329 --> 04:57.997
I was just a regular guy.

04:58.081 --> 05:02.877
No radioactive spiders, no refugee status
from a doomed alien world.

05:03.211 --> 05:06.380
You know what? Todd said
they do still make Count Chocula.

05:06.464 --> 05:09.383
They just don't sell it at the store anymore.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.262
My mother was killed by an aneurism
in the kitchen...

05:13.346 --> 05:16.098
- Mom?
...as opposed to a gunman in the alley.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.266
So if you were hoping for any,

05:17.350 --> 05:20.603
"I will avenge you, Mother!"

05:20.687 --> 05:21.896
You're out of luck.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.190
In the 18 months since my mother died,

05:24.274 --> 05:27.902
the only epiphany I had
was realizing that life just goes on.

05:27.986 --> 05:30.279
Did they change the bee's face?

05:31.406 --> 05:32.406
No.

05:40.457 --> 05:43.125
How come nobody's ever tried
to be a superhero?

05:43.210 --> 05:44.293
Boy, I don't know.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.462
Probably 'cause it's fucking impossible,
dipshit.

05:46.546 --> 05:49.715
What, putting on a mask and
helping people? How's that impossible?

05:49.799 --> 05:51.926
That's not superhero, though.
How is that super?

05:52.010 --> 05:55.512
Super's like being stronger than everybody
and flying and shit. That's just hero.

05:55.597 --> 05:58.599
No, it's not even hero.
It's just fucking psycho.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.102
Hello? Bruce Wayne?
He didn't have any powers.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.563
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit
that doesn't exist.

06:04.648 --> 06:06.857
I thought you meant, like,
"How come nobody does it in real life?"

06:06.942 --> 06:08.234
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

06:08.318 --> 06:10.986
Dude, if anybody did it in real life,
they'd get their ass kicked.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.113
- They'd be dead in, like, a day.
- A day.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.032
Yeah, okay,
I'm not saying they should do it.

06:15.116 --> 06:16.909
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.038
Seriously, out of all the millions of people
who love superheroes,

06:21.122 --> 06:23.290
you'd think one would give it a try.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.252
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

06:26.336 --> 06:28.045
Why thousands of people
wanna be Paris Hilton

06:28.129 --> 06:29.505
and nobody wants to be Spider-Man?

06:29.589 --> 06:32.508
Yeah, what's with that?
She has, like, no tits at all.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.052
Maybe it's the porn tape.
He doesn't have a porn tape.

06:35.136 --> 06:37.638
You guys never saw
One Night in Spider-Man?

06:39.599 --> 06:40.641
Guess who?

06:44.896 --> 06:48.565
Is it me or do you kind of feel sorry
for Chris D'Amico?

06:48.650 --> 06:51.277
Yeah, it must be terrible
to have a rich dad and everything you want.

06:51.361 --> 06:52.444
I wish you wouldn't have said anything

06:52.529 --> 06:54.905
- 'cause I feel like I'm gonna start crying.
- Right.

06:54.990 --> 06:57.533
The fact that he's always on his own?

06:59.452 --> 07:03.497
We should, like, talk to him.
See if he wants to hang out with us.

07:03.581 --> 07:05.416
I didn't say we should talk to him. I just...

07:05.500 --> 07:06.959
Think about it. Come on, it'd be awesome.

07:07.043 --> 07:10.045
If he was our friend,
no one would ever fuck with us again.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.338
Well, go on then, Todd. You wanna...

07:11.423 --> 07:12.423
- I can get up.
- No, no...

07:12.507 --> 07:14.925
- You wanna go talk to him? I can move.
- Dave... Dave should go.

07:15.010 --> 07:17.219
- Dave should go.
- Why?

07:17.304 --> 07:18.762
- Dave, you should totally go.
- Go.

07:18.847 --> 07:20.514
- You're a dick.
- Don't be afraid, Dave.

07:20.598 --> 07:22.141
You're a pussy.

07:29.190 --> 07:30.441
Fuck off.

07:36.531 --> 07:37.698
Did you spray anything over there?

07:37.782 --> 07:40.868
Yeah, I think
I might have just shat in my pants a little.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.078
- See you later.
- God, see you.

07:43.413 --> 07:46.040
If that guy would have spoken to me
like that, I would have kicked his ass.

07:46.124 --> 07:48.375
Todd, when have you ever
kicked anyone's ass?

07:48.460 --> 07:51.003
Whatever, man.
I would have just gone for his knees.

07:51.087 --> 07:53.630
- You're not making sense.
- What I'm saying is the centrifugal force

07:53.715 --> 07:56.717
of Batman's batarang would undoubtedly
penetrate the Joker's force field,

07:56.801 --> 07:59.303
- leaving him totally vulnerable to the...
- All right...

07:59.387 --> 08:01.096
- Pussy patrol.
- Fuck.

08:01.389 --> 08:04.266
- Phones, money.
- Dude, not again, come on.

08:06.519 --> 08:07.811
- Phone.
- I don't have one.

08:07.896 --> 08:10.689
- Someone else jacked it last week.
- Pussy.

08:10.982 --> 08:13.484
- Give me the bag.
- It's just comics.

08:13.568 --> 08:15.486
Yo, you want to get cut?

08:25.580 --> 08:28.082
Look at this asshole just watching.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.255
Come on, be honest with yourself.

08:36.091 --> 08:38.509
Would you do anything differently?

08:40.178 --> 08:43.389
We see someone in trouble
and we wish we could help,

08:43.472 --> 08:44.932
but we don't.

08:49.270 --> 08:53.107
The world I lived in,
heroes only existed in comic books.

08:54.692 --> 08:59.113
And I guess that would have been okay
if bad guys were make-believe, too.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.448
But they're not.

09:02.450 --> 09:05.619
Frankie, I'm telling you, man,
I swear I'm not making this up.

09:06.121 --> 09:10.624
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere,
kicks our asses,

09:10.708 --> 09:12.709
and steals all the coke.

09:12.794 --> 09:14.545
This would be the guy
that looks like Batman?

09:14.629 --> 09:16.380
I didn't say he looked like Batman.

09:16.464 --> 09:19.258
You did, Tre.
You said the guy looked like Batman.

09:19.342 --> 09:21.385
- He said like a mask and stuff.
- And a cape.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.637
- Yeah, like Batman.
- I didn't say "Like Batman."

09:23.721 --> 09:25.305
I never said "Batman."

09:25.390 --> 09:26.473
Okay.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.561
Let me tell you the problem
I got with that, Tre.

09:30.645 --> 09:34.356
Our mole with the Russians
tells things a little different.

09:35.442 --> 09:39.611
According to him, you sold him my coke
and you took the money.

09:39.696 --> 09:41.530
That's a fucking lie!

09:42.031 --> 09:46.076
I can't believe that you would believe
this shit from a fucking Russian, man!

09:46.161 --> 09:49.163
Let me see, Tre.
Hey, what's more likely, huh?

09:49.581 --> 09:54.460
That you're a greedy little cocksucker
or all my coke was stolen by Superman?

09:54.752 --> 09:56.420
- Batman.
- I never said Batman!

09:56.504 --> 09:57.671
Enough!

10:01.009 --> 10:04.178
Now my son is waiting out there
in the car to go to the movies,

10:04.262 --> 10:05.846
and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.016
Joe, you're in charge.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.602
- Frank... Frankie!
- That's gotta be the worst fucking excuse

10:11.686 --> 10:13.312
I ever heard, Tre.

10:20.695 --> 10:23.739
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy.
- The movie is starting in 10 minutes.

10:23.823 --> 10:27.117
It's okay. We're cool.
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

10:27.202 --> 10:29.119
Yeah. But I want to get some popcorn.

10:29.204 --> 10:31.038
When we get in there,
get Chris some popcorn.

10:31.122 --> 10:33.332
- Okay?
- You fucking motherfuckers!

10:33.416 --> 10:34.791
What do you want to drink?
You want a Pepsi?

10:34.876 --> 10:38.170
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Get him a Pepsi, and I'll have an Icee.

10:38.254 --> 10:39.421
Mixed.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.799
Like when they mix
the red one and the blue one.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.886
And a pack of Twizzlers.

11:07.408 --> 11:09.618
The comic books had it wrong.

11:10.078 --> 11:14.706
It didn't take a trauma or cosmic rays
or a power ring to make a superhero.

11:16.334 --> 11:20.087
Just the perfect combination
of optimism and naivety.

11:54.122 --> 11:56.665
You are fucking awesome.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.503
Come on then, bring it on!

12:28.656 --> 12:29.906
Daddy, I'm scared.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.908
Come on, Mindy, honey.

12:31.993 --> 12:34.745
Be a big girl now.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

12:35.079 --> 12:37.664
- Is it gonna hurt bad?
- Oh, child.

12:38.249 --> 12:40.042
Only for a second, sugar.

12:40.126 --> 12:43.170
A handgun bullet travels at... More than?

12:43.254 --> 12:45.756
- 700 miles an hour.
- 700 miles an hour.

12:45.840 --> 12:49.926
So at close range like this, the force
is gonna take you off your feet for sure,

12:50.511 --> 12:53.138
but it's really no more painful
than a punch in the chest.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.724
I hate getting punched in the chest.

12:56.351 --> 12:58.685
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

13:06.110 --> 13:08.362
How was that? Not so bad.

13:08.946 --> 13:11.865
Kind of fun, huh?
Now you know how it feels.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.494
You won't be scared
when some junkie asshole pulls a Glock.

13:15.578 --> 13:18.372
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways.
- That's my girl.

13:18.456 --> 13:22.793
All right, up you get. Come on.
Two more rounds and then home.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.127
Again?

13:25.421 --> 13:28.131
Look, only if we can go
by the bowling alley on the way back.

13:28.591 --> 13:30.133
The bowling alley?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.594
Yeah. And ice cream after.

13:34.889 --> 13:37.307
Okay. Two more rounds.

13:37.558 --> 13:42.854
No wincing, no whining,
and you got yourself a deal, young lady.

13:42.939 --> 13:45.816
Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.734
Good call, baby doll.

13:51.072 --> 13:54.616
So, have you thought a little more about
what you might want for your birthday?

13:55.410 --> 13:56.785
Can I get a puppy?

13:58.287 --> 13:59.538
You wanna get a dog?

13:59.747 --> 14:01.665
Yeah, a cuddly, fluffy one.

14:01.749 --> 14:04.167
And a Bratz Movie Star Makeover Sasha.

14:09.424 --> 14:11.133
I'm just fucking with you, Daddy.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.927
Look, I'd love
a Benchmade Model 42 butterfly knife.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.179
Oh, child.

14:16.431 --> 14:18.765
You always knock me for a loop.

14:18.850 --> 14:19.933
- You know what?
- What?

14:20.017 --> 14:21.977
- I'm gonna get you two.
- Two?

14:22.061 --> 14:25.105
One balisong. Two balisong.
That's what you get.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.835
"The glass of fashion and the mold of form

14:46.919 --> 14:50.547
"The observed of all observers
quite, quite down!

14:50.840 --> 14:53.800
"And I, of ladies
most deject and wretched..."

14:59.807 --> 15:01.099
I'll be honest,

15:01.184 --> 15:05.270
there wasn't a whole lot
of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.

15:05.354 --> 15:08.523
But even so,
my new vocation kept me plenty busy.

15:13.821 --> 15:14.821
Shit.

15:14.906 --> 15:16.865
I called it preparation.

15:20.620 --> 15:24.748
But if you called it fantasizing,
it would have been hard to argue.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.835
All I knew was
I'd never felt so good about myself.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.062
Fuck!

15:48.147 --> 15:51.358
Okay, maybe I was still
in the beta-testing phase,

15:51.943 --> 15:53.693
but it was a start.

16:10.711 --> 16:12.337
What the fuck are you looking at?

16:13.339 --> 16:15.465
- Nothing.
- Get the fuck out of here.

16:20.721 --> 16:22.806
Like every serial killer already knew,

16:22.890 --> 16:26.518
eventually, fantasizing
just doesn't do it for you anymore.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.895
It was time to engage.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.232
Hurry up, man.

16:35.403 --> 16:36.903
What the fuck?

16:45.830 --> 16:47.539
What the fuck you looking at?

16:48.499 --> 16:51.209
I said, what the fuck are you looking at?

16:56.048 --> 16:58.508
Two cheap-shit losers screwing with a car

16:58.593 --> 17:02.053
that someone probably
worked their ass off to pay for.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.098
- Say what?
- Leave it be, man.

17:06.474 --> 17:09.019
This motherfucker is obviously high.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.186
I'm not high.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.107
I just think it sucks
you guys think you can do what you want.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.236
Just walk away from the car
and we can forget about this.

17:21.115 --> 17:22.824
You're crazy, man.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.742
Fuck this shit.

17:38.382 --> 17:41.051
- Shit!
- Let's get out of here!

18:22.385 --> 18:24.594
I came around for just long enough
to beg the medic

18:24.679 --> 18:27.263
not to tell anybody about the costume.

18:27.682 --> 18:29.683
He promised he wouldn't.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.728
All I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.621
Why can't I have a gun?
I'm a security guard.

18:51.706 --> 18:54.040
You're a doorman now.
You don't get a gun no more.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.458
Look at me. I look like a putz.

18:55.543 --> 18:59.629
You look sharp. Look at all them buttons.
Do your job. Open the fucking door.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.134
Have a nice day.

19:32.121 --> 19:34.831
- Good morning, Frank.
- Hey, Joe, how you doing?

19:34.915 --> 19:36.916
- Great.
- Want some coffee?

19:37.418 --> 19:39.294
Maybe later. Morning, Ange.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.420
- Good morning.
- Chris.

19:40.504 --> 19:42.172
Good morning, Joe.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.758
Frank, we got a thing.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.470
It's a big thing, Frank.

19:51.515 --> 19:52.640
Okay.

19:53.601 --> 19:54.768
Sorry, hon.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.603
Do what you got to do.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.068
Chris, where do you think you're going?

20:03.152 --> 20:05.403
- I got to talk to Dad.
- Christopher.

20:05.488 --> 20:06.946
Frank, honey!

20:09.450 --> 20:10.825
Where do you think you're going?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.703
I don't...
I don't mind you talking business, Dad.

20:13.788 --> 20:14.996
I was just gonna sit in there quietly.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.624
I mean, I should probably
start learning this stuff anyway, right?

20:17.708 --> 20:19.250
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

20:19.335 --> 20:23.296
God damn it! I'm gonna be 18
in eight months, for Christ's sakes.

20:23.464 --> 20:24.631
Fuck.

20:26.509 --> 20:27.926
Take a seat.

20:30.971 --> 20:33.848
- So what's the problem?
- Our Russian says that Tre just sold him

20:33.933 --> 20:36.351
another five keys at half price.

20:36.811 --> 20:38.728
Which Tre? Tre Tre?

20:38.813 --> 20:40.480
Right. Dead Tre.

20:40.981 --> 20:42.816
So now I'm getting fucked
in the ass by a ghost?

20:43.150 --> 20:44.776
Or Tre was telling the truth.

20:45.319 --> 20:50.156
What, this is my choice,
I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?

20:50.533 --> 20:52.575
Well, not the part about
the superhero, Frankie,

20:52.660 --> 20:55.995
but just that he might have
really been gaffled by somebody.

21:00.042 --> 21:03.670
I think we'd better invite
our Russian over for a friendly chat,

21:05.714 --> 21:07.841
see what's really going on.

21:23.274 --> 21:24.524
Hey, early birdie.

21:25.276 --> 21:28.361
You beat me to it.
I wanted to get you breakfast this morning.

21:29.029 --> 21:31.030
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.033
Check this out.

21:42.751 --> 21:44.794
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

21:44.879 --> 21:46.296
Oh, my gosh.

21:46.714 --> 21:47.755
Dad.

21:50.968 --> 21:52.051
Wow.

21:52.386 --> 21:53.720
Watch, Dad.

21:54.096 --> 21:55.763
Okay, pop quiz.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.473
What's the proper name for one of those?

21:57.558 --> 22:00.059
Easy, balisong. It's Filipino.
Ask me another.

22:00.144 --> 22:01.311
Excellent, good.

22:01.395 --> 22:07.275
The AR-15 was a lighter,
smaller caliber version of what design?

22:07.735 --> 22:10.737
Eugene Stoner's AR-10.
Now give me a hard one.

22:11.071 --> 22:12.572
The name of

22:14.074 --> 22:17.243
John Woo's first full-length feature?

22:17.578 --> 22:19.829
Tie han rou qing, The Young Dragons.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.581
Daddy, look.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.292
Hey, come on, you're not looking.

22:26.462 --> 22:29.672
The point is,
some fucker is killing our guys.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.258
Until we find out who that is,
I don't wanna see

22:32.343 --> 22:35.011
any of you bitches sitting around
on your asses, all right?

22:35.095 --> 22:36.763
What the fuck do you...

22:37.181 --> 22:38.223
Hello?

22:38.807 --> 22:40.308
Hey, Joe, yeah.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.727
No, he's just training right now.

22:43.103 --> 22:44.103
One second.

22:44.813 --> 22:46.481
Dad, phone!

22:48.776 --> 22:50.652
- Dad, the phone's for you.
- Who is it?

22:50.945 --> 22:52.237
It's Joe.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.034
- What's the problem?
- Yeah, Frank,

22:58.118 --> 23:00.078
turns out we ain't got
the vise here no more.

23:00.162 --> 23:01.412
Really?

23:02.122 --> 23:04.540
But we do got
a brand-new industrial microwave.

23:04.625 --> 23:05.792
They use it for treating the lumber.

23:05.876 --> 23:07.585
Well, that is neat.

23:08.295 --> 23:10.046
I think you must be confusing me
with someone

23:10.130 --> 23:12.131
who gives a shit about the fucking lumber!

23:12.216 --> 23:14.509
Yeah, okay, all right, Frank.
All right, I'm sorry.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.052
- I'm sorry, okay?
...get the information.

23:16.136 --> 23:17.762
All right, okay!

23:19.139 --> 23:20.306
All right, come on. Go ahead.

23:20.557 --> 23:24.060
Hey, look, the guys tell me
he's Tre Fernandez. What do I know?

23:24.144 --> 23:25.895
- Shut up.
- Now you say Fernandez is dead.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.939
- Get inside. Shut up!
- Okay, no, he lied!

23:28.023 --> 23:30.441
- He lie about...
- Fucking mamaluke.

23:30.609 --> 23:31.818
He lied!

23:32.653 --> 23:34.487
Does this work like
a regular microwave or what?

23:34.947 --> 23:37.448
Fuck do I know? We're not making
a fucking Hungry-Man dinner here.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.158
Just turn it on.

23:42.121 --> 23:43.121
Here we go.

23:43.205 --> 23:45.957
Okay, I wanna know who sold you our coke.

23:46.458 --> 23:49.544
And don't tell me somebody
who's dead this time.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.883
Can he hear you?
I don't think he can hear you.

23:57.386 --> 24:00.930
I said, who really sold you our coke?

24:04.810 --> 24:05.977
Who

24:06.437 --> 24:08.479
sold you

24:09.189 --> 24:11.065
our coke?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.820
Shit. Shit.

24:20.993 --> 24:24.370
This is awesome!
I look like fricking Wolverine.

24:25.497 --> 24:28.124
They still have
that metal detector at your school?

24:28.208 --> 24:30.585
Yeah, it's gonna have a meltdown.

24:33.088 --> 24:35.506
Dave, I need to ask you something.

24:37.384 --> 24:38.509
Okay.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.470
The police report,

24:40.554 --> 24:41.804
they found you naked.

24:41.889 --> 24:44.307
You said you didn't remember why.

24:44.933 --> 24:47.060
The muggers, they didn't...

24:48.395 --> 24:49.479
What?

24:51.899 --> 24:53.608
No! Jesus.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.277
No, I... I wasn't even...

24:57.571 --> 24:59.572
In the ambulance,
they threw my clothes away

24:59.656 --> 25:01.783
- 'cause of the blood.
- Right.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.409
Okay, okay.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.995
Dad. Dad.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.793
Seemed like no time at all
before I was back on my feet.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.087
- Dave's what?
- Not now.

25:15.130 --> 25:17.173
Apart from some messed up nerve endings,

25:17.257 --> 25:20.343
the doctors had managed
to fix me up pretty good.

25:20.427 --> 25:22.011
- Did you feel that?
- No.

25:22.096 --> 25:25.390
You're like fucking Jason Bourne
or something, man. That owns.

25:25.474 --> 25:27.475
- How about that?
- No, Marty!

25:27.643 --> 25:29.477
Give it a fucking rest, man.

25:29.561 --> 25:30.895
I've only been back half a day,

25:30.979 --> 25:32.897
and you're already
making me miss the hospital.

25:32.981 --> 25:35.858
He's right. I'm sorry.
I'm acting totally childish.

25:35.943 --> 25:38.277
- Stop with the fork.
- I apologize.

25:49.498 --> 25:50.665
Hey.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.585
Dave, hey.

25:56.463 --> 25:57.630
Hey.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.550
How are you? You look better.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.262
I'm good. Yeah, much better.

26:04.346 --> 26:06.180
Hey, you're into comic books, aren't you?

26:07.099 --> 26:09.642
Well, me and Erika
sometimes hang out after school

26:09.726 --> 26:12.186
at this really great store Atomic Comics.

26:12.271 --> 26:15.064
They make the best
white chocolate mocha latte.

26:15.149 --> 26:16.274
Yeah?

26:18.152 --> 26:21.863
Well, I could buy you one sometime
if you, you know, like,

26:21.947 --> 26:23.906
need someone to talk to.

26:25.993 --> 26:27.660
Sure. Thank you.

26:27.744 --> 26:30.538
Okay, sweet. Well, I'll see you later.

26:34.460 --> 26:35.710
- Man, did you see that?
- Yeah.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.962
Katie Deauxma
just offered to buy me coffee.

26:38.046 --> 26:40.840
Yeah. You know,
I really don't think that's what it looks like.

26:40.924 --> 26:43.634
- What are you talking about?
- The point is,

26:43.719 --> 26:46.262
Katie Deauxma's all about the lame ducks.

26:46.346 --> 26:47.763
What's this got to do with me?

26:47.848 --> 26:50.349
I've been trying to figure out
how to tell you this.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.728
- There's a rumor going around...
- Right.

26:53.812 --> 26:55.313
...that you...
- What?

26:55.397 --> 26:57.273
...are gay.
- Gay?

26:57.399 --> 26:58.816
What kind of rumor is that?

26:58.901 --> 27:00.193
Well, you know, I mean, getting mugged...

27:00.277 --> 27:02.695
- You guys have been mugged!
- Yeah, I know, but,

27:02.779 --> 27:05.364
you know, we didn't get beat up
and have all our clothes taken off.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.326
That's not even true.
The medic threw my clothes away.

27:09.369 --> 27:11.621
You know, don't worry about it.
Rumors don't mean shit.

27:11.705 --> 27:13.623
- We know the truth. Yeah.
- Right?

27:13.707 --> 27:16.042
And who knows, buddy,
this might even get you laid.

27:16.126 --> 27:19.420
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd.
You fucking retard.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.297
Thanks, Marty,
this is really fucking helping me.

27:21.381 --> 27:22.465
I'm just being honest!

27:26.345 --> 27:28.596
I was getting back to my old self.

27:29.056 --> 27:33.184
I should have quit, of course,
but you can't just reprogram yourself.

27:33.894 --> 27:37.063
What you want, who you are,
your purpose in life.

27:37.439 --> 27:39.565
No, I'm just standing around, you know.

27:40.442 --> 27:41.943
No, I'm not!

27:42.027 --> 27:43.069
It is what it is.

27:43.153 --> 27:45.071
How about that, huh?

27:46.740 --> 27:49.534
Yeah. Didn't see that, did you?

27:49.618 --> 27:51.494
I think it's best that you just walk away.

27:51.578 --> 27:52.870
Well, maybe you shouldn't do that.

27:53.205 --> 27:56.082
What? Are you looking at me?
Well, this is my business.

28:08.095 --> 28:11.180
Me? My hardware was fixed now.

28:11.723 --> 28:15.101
I was back and running
Kick-Ass version 2.0.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.696
Excuse me, have you seen this cat?

28:26.780 --> 28:29.115
- No.
- No? Okay, thank you.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.159
Excuse me, ma'am. Have you seen this cat?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.789
I'm sorry. Did you see this cat?

28:37.541 --> 28:39.333
No? Okay.

29:00.314 --> 29:01.772
Oh, great.

29:03.150 --> 29:06.110
Here, kitty. Here, Mr. Bitey.

29:11.825 --> 29:13.409
Come on... No, no, no, no, no!

29:13.493 --> 29:15.244
No, no, no. Mr. Bitey, come on.

29:15.746 --> 29:18.331
Back here, come on.
Let's get you home. Come on.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.137
Fuck you, Mr. Bitey!

29:36.808 --> 29:39.977
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry, man.
- You fucking green...

29:41.688 --> 29:43.356
Get up. Get him up.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.108
- Get up.
- Thanks, freak.

29:48.904 --> 29:52.365
- Hey, leave him alone!
- Fuck off, man. It's none of your business!

29:55.327 --> 29:56.702
Yes, it is.

30:24.815 --> 30:26.565
Hey! Call 911!

30:32.072 --> 30:34.865
Hey, there's a dude
dressed like a superhero out there

30:34.950 --> 30:36.200
fighting a bunch of guys.

30:40.872 --> 30:42.123
It's fucking awesome!

31:10.277 --> 31:11.902
Leave him alone!

31:17.951 --> 31:20.286
Give it up, man. Just walk away.

31:21.580 --> 31:22.705
No. Never.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.666
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

31:25.751 --> 31:29.795
You'd rather die for some piece of shit
that you don't even fucking know?

31:30.589 --> 31:32.006
And three assholes

31:32.090 --> 31:34.133
laying into one guy
while everybody else watches,

31:35.635 --> 31:37.803
and you want to know
what's wrong with me?

31:40.307 --> 31:42.433
Yeah, I'd rather die.

31:43.059 --> 31:44.685
So bring it on!

31:48.774 --> 31:49.899
You're fucking crazy, kid.

31:54.196 --> 31:55.196
Fuck.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.616
Thank you.

31:58.700 --> 31:59.742
What?

32:00.952 --> 32:01.994
Thank you.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.541
That fucking rocked. Who are you?

32:10.086 --> 32:11.629
I'm Kick-Ass.

32:16.176 --> 32:18.761
- Dude, you gotta check this shit out.
- What is it?

32:18.845 --> 32:22.014
...on the latest corruption scandal.
And coming up after the hour,

32:22.098 --> 32:25.559
a costumed vigilante
has become the latest Internet phenomenon

32:25.644 --> 32:29.104
after a Hamilton Park resident
filmed the man's remarkable intervention

32:29.189 --> 32:30.648
in a gang-related attack last week.

32:30.732 --> 32:32.525
- This is awesome.
- Fuck, yeah.

32:32.859 --> 32:35.402
Welcome to this special edition
of Eye on New York.

32:35.904 --> 32:38.447
How far would you go
to help your fellow man?

32:38.698 --> 32:41.951
This colorful individual
has been all over the news this week

32:42.035 --> 32:45.120
after a video of his intervention
of street-gang violence

32:45.205 --> 32:48.123
became the most-watched clip
on the Internet.

32:48.208 --> 32:51.585
Three assholes laying into one guy while...

32:51.670 --> 32:57.800
My MySpace, 38 friends.
Kick-Ass's MySpace, 16,000 and counting.

32:58.218 --> 33:01.720
This thing was going crazy,
and I was loving it.

33:01.805 --> 33:05.391
And finally,
we want to know who is this man?

33:05.475 --> 33:09.061
Does anyone have any idea
who this wetsuit crusader is?

33:09.437 --> 33:11.981
He must be someone's son,
someone's brother,

33:12.065 --> 33:13.983
- someone's next-door neighbor.
- Holy shit.

33:14.067 --> 33:15.651
- Have you seen him?
- What happened?

33:15.735 --> 33:18.195
What happened? This guy happened.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.740
It's a great day for America, everybody.

33:21.825 --> 33:25.828
Yeah, everybody's favorite superhero
right now, Kick-Ass, right?

33:25.912 --> 33:29.164
Kick-Ass! Yeah!

33:30.166 --> 33:34.295
I like Kick-Ass! His costume is crappy.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.130
He looks like a transvestite...

33:36.214 --> 33:39.341
You know what? Everyone likes Kick-Ass.

33:39.426 --> 33:41.719
Did you see the clip?
He was actually pretty good.

33:41.803 --> 33:44.430
Good at getting his ass kicked.

33:44.514 --> 33:47.975
He should call himselfAss-Kick instead.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.268
That doesn't even make sense.

33:49.352 --> 33:52.271
...transvestite that is Kick-Ass
will take you down, I say!

33:52.355 --> 33:54.189
That guy's gonna end up dead,
that's what I think.

33:54.274 --> 33:56.567
Are you serious? The guy owns.

33:56.651 --> 33:59.361
I'd e-mail his site
if I had a problem worth fixing.

33:59.446 --> 34:01.614
What? Are you kidding me?
I got 100 guys who can fix a problem,

34:01.698 --> 34:04.074
you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

34:04.159 --> 34:07.453
Well, I wouldn't wanna get in the way
of your business, where I'm not wanted.

34:07.537 --> 34:10.039
Please, I know
you have mistaken me for Kick-Ass,

34:10.123 --> 34:12.081
but I am not Kick-Ass.

34:30.726 --> 34:33.728
- You don't actually read comics?
- Yeah, I just started.

34:33.813 --> 34:35.313
I got recommended some.

34:35.398 --> 34:38.442
Like Scott Pilgrim and Shojo Beat,
that kind of thing.

34:38.525 --> 34:41.402
I'm not really into
the whole superhero thing, though.

34:42.237 --> 34:45.783
So I guess you're not gonna line up
for that new Kick-Ass comic then?

34:45.867 --> 34:46.909
I guess not.

34:47.744 --> 34:50.245
But you know what?
I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.

34:50.330 --> 34:52.831
I mean, I could really use some help
from a guy like that right now.

34:53.083 --> 34:55.501
Help? Really? What with?

34:56.543 --> 34:58.379
You know I volunteer
at the needle exchange.

34:59.547 --> 35:00.673
No, I didn't.

35:00.757 --> 35:04.343
Well, there's this one guy Rasul,
and I felt so sorry for him.

35:04.427 --> 35:08.514
And the more I found out
about his upbringing and stuff, I just...

35:10.558 --> 35:14.353
Wow, that's weird.
I'm usually the one playing therapist.

35:17.065 --> 35:19.191
Can I make a confession?

35:19.859 --> 35:23.654
Ever since I was little,
I've always wanted a friend

35:24.364 --> 35:25.906
like you.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.409
- Is it okay to say that?
- Yeah.

35:28.493 --> 35:30.119
I mean, that's not homophobic, is it?

35:31.871 --> 35:34.707
I mean, I don't think
you're all the same or anything.

35:43.550 --> 35:47.302
- Of course not, no.
- Thank you.

35:52.267 --> 35:56.562
I don't know if I was everything Katie
had always dreamed her gay BFF would be,

35:56.646 --> 35:58.313
but I tried my best.

35:58.398 --> 36:02.026
But more importantly,
I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.

36:03.069 --> 36:07.156
Long story short,
this particular lame duck of hers

36:07.240 --> 36:09.908
turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

36:10.452 --> 36:12.745
She didn't want the money back
that she'd given him

36:12.829 --> 36:16.081
or an apology for the black eye
he'd given her.

36:16.166 --> 36:18.292
She just wanted him
to get that they were through

36:18.376 --> 36:20.002
and leave her alone.

36:20.086 --> 36:24.423
And let's be real, no other request
could have given me more pleasure.

36:41.608 --> 36:45.110
Who the fuck are you supposed to be,
the Green Condom?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.864
You know it ain't Halloween
for another few months, kid?

36:48.948 --> 36:50.074
I'm here to see Rasul.

36:52.285 --> 36:54.119
Who the fuck are you?

36:54.204 --> 36:56.705
I'm... I'm a friend of Katie's.

37:02.796 --> 37:04.880
Kids nowadays in their tights.

37:19.312 --> 37:22.272
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

37:29.239 --> 37:33.283
I'm Rasul. Can't you tell by my big titties?

37:36.871 --> 37:39.164
What is this? Trick or treat or something?

37:40.375 --> 37:42.417
Fuck! Now I'm dead.

37:43.837 --> 37:47.256
I have a message for Rasul
about Katie Deauxma.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.928
- Katie?
- You're Rasul?

37:53.638 --> 37:57.432
Okay. You gotta stay away from Katie now.
It's over.

37:57.809 --> 38:01.311
So if you just leave her alone,
everything will be fine.

38:02.021 --> 38:03.188
What?

38:04.399 --> 38:08.318
Yo, kid, who the hell are you?
And what is this?

38:09.320 --> 38:11.613
I'm Kick-Ass. Look me up.

38:12.115 --> 38:14.408
And this is me giving you a message.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.535
Leave Katie alone.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.382
Or what?

38:34.846 --> 38:37.181
Or I'll come back

38:38.725 --> 38:40.475
and break your fucking legs.

38:45.648 --> 38:47.191
I'm right here now, baby. What's up?

38:49.611 --> 38:50.903
Oh, fuck!

38:57.994 --> 38:59.244
Hold him.

39:06.085 --> 39:08.128
You are so fucking dead, man.

39:23.061 --> 39:26.730
Okay, you cunts,
let's see what you can do now.

39:27.565 --> 39:32.027
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

39:41.996 --> 39:43.121
Oh, shit!

39:52.799 --> 39:53.840
What the fuck?

40:21.619 --> 40:23.036
Hey, I got one of those.

40:41.097 --> 40:42.347
Come on.

40:43.141 --> 40:44.224
So you want to play.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.534
What the fuck?

41:05.747 --> 41:09.041
Dude, that is one gay-looking Taser.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.379
Relax, we're on the same team.

41:15.548 --> 41:17.466
- Hey, get up.
- No...

41:23.056 --> 41:26.600
Now, Hit Girl,
we always keep our backs where?

41:27.393 --> 41:29.186
To the wall, Daddy. I know.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.855
It won't happen again.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.900
- Nice shot, by the way.
- Thank you.

41:52.794 --> 41:54.086
Let's go.

41:55.463 --> 41:58.715
Hey, hey, asshole.
Can't use the front door now.

42:13.439 --> 42:15.065
Wait, wait, wait!

42:15.942 --> 42:17.109
What?

42:18.152 --> 42:19.236
Who are you?

42:19.612 --> 42:20.779
Me?

42:21.697 --> 42:23.198
I'm Hit Girl.

42:24.784 --> 42:26.785
And that's Big Daddy.

42:33.543 --> 42:34.793
Come on.

42:39.674 --> 42:40.715
Come on!

43:17.587 --> 43:21.006
Hit Girl and Big Daddy,
they were the real deal.

43:23.676 --> 43:24.885
Me?

43:25.511 --> 43:28.263
I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.

43:43.863 --> 43:45.489
What is this? What am I looking at here?

43:46.282 --> 43:49.618
It was Sal's phone.
They found it in his hand.

43:49.702 --> 43:51.786
He must have taken that
right before he died.

43:52.288 --> 43:56.458
I know this sounds fucked up, Frankie,
but that guy in the picture,

43:56.959 --> 44:00.045
I think it's that superhero nutjob
from the TV.

44:00.338 --> 44:01.379
Who?

44:02.340 --> 44:03.548
Kick-Ass?

44:04.258 --> 44:05.509
One guy?

44:06.385 --> 44:09.179
Hold on, you're telling me
one guy killed eight of my men tonight?

44:14.060 --> 44:17.812
Eight at Sal's place, four at that kid Rasul's.

44:19.524 --> 44:21.608
We have no merchandise
on the street at all?

44:21.692 --> 44:22.859
Right.

44:25.571 --> 44:27.697
- One guy?
- I think.

44:28.407 --> 44:32.077
Man, if you're right, we're gonna look like
the biggest bunch of pussies in New York.

44:32.745 --> 44:34.079
What do you want me to do?

44:35.248 --> 44:39.918
I want Kick-Ass's fucking head
on a stick, and I want it now.

44:49.762 --> 44:51.763
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

44:52.098 --> 44:55.767
Good move, Ass-Kick.
Let's keep it that way.

44:57.395 --> 44:58.603
You know what this is?

44:59.730 --> 45:03.275
It's all the cartridge crap that comes out
of your gay little Taser when you fire it.

45:03.609 --> 45:07.070
You do know the police could have traced
this right back to you if they'd found it?

45:07.154 --> 45:09.823
But lucky for you, I picked it up.

45:11.492 --> 45:12.492
Thank you.

45:13.578 --> 45:17.497
Let's call it insurance.
Makes it easier for us to take your word.

45:17.707 --> 45:20.750
See, we like you, but we don't trust you.

45:22.128 --> 45:24.754
Don't take it personal, though.
We don't trust anybody.

45:24.839 --> 45:30.885
I rerouted your IP address.
Finding you was way too easy.

45:31.804 --> 45:34.889
Shit. Shit, I hadn't thought...

45:35.182 --> 45:37.851
My God, I... I owe you.

45:38.477 --> 45:41.771
You know what? I'm thinking of
just shutting my site down anyway.

45:41.856 --> 45:44.190
Quitting. I mean, this is...

45:44.442 --> 45:48.153
It's fucking insane. I'm in way over my head.

45:48.446 --> 45:50.739
It's a shame. You have potential.

45:50.823 --> 45:53.783
Your call,
but you know we're around if you need us.

45:55.328 --> 45:57.162
How do I get a hold of you?

45:57.246 --> 46:01.499
You just contact the mayor's office.
He has a special signal he shines in the sky.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.168
It's in the shape of a giant cock.

46:04.503 --> 46:06.921
You need us, put on your website
that you're on vacation.

46:07.006 --> 46:10.175
We'll find you.
Hit Girl, back to headquarters.

46:11.844 --> 46:13.303
Sweet dreams.

46:19.268 --> 46:20.935
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

46:21.020 --> 46:23.730
- Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up?
- What's up?

46:24.190 --> 46:27.817
Kick-Ass is killing my men, Gigante,
that's what's up.

46:27.902 --> 46:29.569
My condolences, Frank.

46:29.779 --> 46:33.073
But I'm afraid
I can't help you out on this one.

46:33.157 --> 46:35.033
Little bit outside my jurisdiction.

46:35.409 --> 46:36.868
Outside your jurisdiction?

46:37.203 --> 46:39.162
You're a fucking cop,
and he's breaking the law.

46:39.246 --> 46:42.540
That's so inside your jurisdiction,
it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.670
Listen, cops pay me to nail the bad guys,
you pay me not to.

46:47.254 --> 46:48.797
Everything else is in the gray area.

46:48.881 --> 46:51.299
Yeah. Fuck you very much, Vic.
Just do it, okay?

46:53.344 --> 46:55.178
Un-fucking-believable.

46:56.389 --> 46:58.556
Where's Cody? He's late.

46:59.100 --> 47:03.228
Thank you, Cody.
We appreciate your co-operation.

47:03.604 --> 47:07.190
Let me out now?
I gave you all them names and addresses.

47:08.234 --> 47:09.651
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

47:09.735 --> 47:12.237
You and your crazy midget friend
can go bash whoever you want...

47:12.321 --> 47:14.989
Hey, come on.
Hey, I know some very bad people uptown,

47:15.074 --> 47:18.159
really nasty individuals.
Let me go. Hey, come on!

47:18.661 --> 47:20.662
Hey, don't do this!
You don't need to do this!

47:20.746 --> 47:22.789
Come on. Oh, shit... Please!

47:22.873 --> 47:25.542
Hey! God! No, please, please!

47:25.751 --> 47:27.043
Come on, no, no!

47:46.856 --> 47:48.356
What a douche.

48:01.996 --> 48:04.664
You have done self tan before, right?

48:05.082 --> 48:07.417
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

48:08.335 --> 48:11.713
Murder, superheroes
breaking into my bedroom,

48:11.797 --> 48:14.799
my life had turned into some
fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.

48:16.594 --> 48:19.471
Even the good parts were totally surreal.

48:19.889 --> 48:22.474
Hey, I read those old
Ditko Spider-Mans you gave me.

48:22.558 --> 48:24.934
They're actually pretty good.

48:25.019 --> 48:26.060
Yeah, they are.

48:28.063 --> 48:31.524
And it's been a whole week
since I've heard from Rasul.

48:33.986 --> 48:35.487
That's great.

49:30.709 --> 49:35.463
Once upon a time, there were
two supercops, called Daddy and Marcus,

49:36.090 --> 49:39.425
who were very good at getting bad guys.

49:39.927 --> 49:42.679
Frank D'Amico
was the baddest guy of them all,

49:42.763 --> 49:45.765
and he came up with a plan
to get rid of Daddy.

49:49.812 --> 49:52.897
Being framed as a drug dealer
was the worst possible thing

49:52.982 --> 49:55.400
that could have happened to Daddy.

49:57.236 --> 50:00.864
Prison was not his natural habitat.

50:00.948 --> 50:02.657
He was very upset.

50:06.287 --> 50:09.831
With Daddy in prison,
his pregnant wife was all alone

50:11.584 --> 50:13.293
and could not cope.

50:15.963 --> 50:20.216
But all clouds have a silver lining,
and out of her death,

50:23.888 --> 50:25.597
Mindy was born!

50:26.181 --> 50:29.017
Marcus became the child's guardian,

50:29.101 --> 50:32.020
and Daddy started a plan of his very own.

50:34.023 --> 50:38.192
Five years later, he left prison,
and he was ready.

50:42.114 --> 50:45.575
Now, it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.

50:53.417 --> 50:55.335
How'd you find me, Marcus?

50:55.961 --> 50:58.588
One of us is still a cop, remember?

51:07.181 --> 51:09.015
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

51:09.099 --> 51:11.559
You say brainwashed.
I say made it into a game.

51:11.894 --> 51:13.728
You call this playing, Damon?

51:13.938 --> 51:16.940
Vigilante justice, mass murder.
Come on, partner.

51:19.318 --> 51:20.818
So where is she?

51:21.362 --> 51:23.029
- She's safe.
- Can I see her?

51:24.907 --> 51:26.282
I miss her.

51:28.035 --> 51:29.661
I miss you both.

51:30.412 --> 51:33.957
I appreciate your concern.
But you need to go now.

51:40.339 --> 51:43.675
I should warn you, that asshole Gigante
is looking for Kick-Ass.

51:43.842 --> 51:45.760
He got something to do with you, Damon?

51:45.844 --> 51:49.013
You started some kind of
fucked-up superhero club?

51:49.348 --> 51:52.684
- Never heard of him.
- Okay, well, heads up, all right?

51:53.018 --> 51:54.811
You keep carrying on
like you've been carrying on,

51:54.895 --> 51:58.022
it's only a matter of time
before Gigante is looking for you.

51:58.107 --> 52:01.693
He's been on Frank D'Amico's payroll
ever since you passed up the opportunity.

52:02.778 --> 52:05.113
You know I'm not gonna stop.

52:06.073 --> 52:09.534
Not until D'Amico
and his whole damn operation

52:10.077 --> 52:13.496
are burnt to ashes and buried.

52:15.207 --> 52:17.125
It ain't gonna bring her back, Damon.

52:18.419 --> 52:20.795
This is not the life for Mindy.

52:23.716 --> 52:25.800
You owe that kid a childhood.

52:26.885 --> 52:28.636
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood!

52:29.596 --> 52:31.264
Frank D'Amico!

52:50.367 --> 52:51.909
Holy shit.

52:54.413 --> 52:56.831
I don't fucking believe it.

53:00.169 --> 53:01.794
Follow him, around the corner.

53:02.796 --> 53:04.255
Not too fast.

53:07.426 --> 53:09.135
What's with the high-fives?

53:09.762 --> 53:12.472
I'll give you a motherfucking high-five.

53:13.057 --> 53:16.100
High-fiving bullshit.
Keep going, keep going.

53:17.186 --> 53:18.686
Not too close.

53:23.233 --> 53:27.445
He's going in the alley.

53:27.946 --> 53:31.741
Okay, when I tell you, stop the car. Ready?

53:35.537 --> 53:37.455
Hey, Kick-Ass.

53:38.290 --> 53:39.791
How you doing?

53:41.710 --> 53:43.086
Kill my men, huh?

53:43.420 --> 53:45.296
Take my fucking coke?

53:45.380 --> 53:47.381
Whoa! Whoa! Boss, what are you doing?

53:47.466 --> 53:49.509
- Boss, we gotta go, man. Come on, let's go.
- Fucking scumbag!

53:49.593 --> 53:51.803
Frank, Frank, Frank, come on,
he's had enough. Come on.

53:51.887 --> 53:53.846
He's had enough. Come on.

53:54.389 --> 53:56.641
What the fuck are you looking at?

53:58.852 --> 54:00.019
Frank.

54:09.696 --> 54:12.031
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, let's go. We gotta go.

54:13.117 --> 54:15.660
Shit. Come on, come on, get in.

54:22.543 --> 54:25.920
He was so young.
No one should have to die that way.

54:26.004 --> 54:29.257
I mean, I just can't believe he's dead,
that's all.

54:31.009 --> 54:33.678
I know. But, Katie,

54:34.805 --> 54:38.349
guys like Rasul, they get mixed up in stuff...

54:38.809 --> 54:42.145
No, I know, I know.
But what if it was my fault?

54:42.229 --> 54:43.271
What if Kick-Ass did it?

54:43.355 --> 54:45.314
I mean, I feel like
I should call the cops or something.

54:45.399 --> 54:47.191
What? You're talking crazy.

54:47.734 --> 54:50.403
There's no way. He probably
didn't even read your e-mail yet.

54:50.737 --> 54:52.780
- Yeah.
- You've got nothing to worry about.

54:54.658 --> 54:56.367
I'm so glad you're here.

54:56.994 --> 54:58.161
I was such a mess.

54:58.871 --> 55:00.246
That's okay.

55:00.330 --> 55:03.583
- No problem.
- You're the best.

55:05.586 --> 55:10.047
I hope it's okay to say this, but...
It so sucks that you're gay.

55:13.969 --> 55:16.220
I don't fucking believe this.

55:18.515 --> 55:22.476
What kind of
children's enter-fucking-tainer is that?

55:23.729 --> 55:28.941
What kind of kid has a... A Spider-Man
party, sure, but a fucking Kick-Ass party?

55:29.026 --> 55:31.736
What, are they selling paper plates
and napkins down at the store now?

55:31.820 --> 55:34.238
Frank, you're scaring me. You're losing it.

55:34.573 --> 55:37.533
Since when did you start getting
your hands dirty again? And in public!

55:37.618 --> 55:39.994
Since when I ask you fucks
to deliver me Kick-Ass,

55:40.078 --> 55:43.456
- and you don't deliver, that's when.
- Give me a break. It's been a week.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.918
We e-mailed him. We got half the crew out
doing petty crimes as bait.

55:47.127 --> 55:48.669
We're busting our asses here.

55:49.755 --> 55:51.839
What the hell are you doing?

55:51.924 --> 55:53.674
You're back on the powder now, as well?

55:53.759 --> 55:57.762
"Mommy, I want a Kick-Ass party."
Dumb little fucks.

55:58.931 --> 56:01.641
- I know a way you can get him.
- Shit.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.309
Chris, how long you been there?

56:03.393 --> 56:04.769
What the hell are you doing?
Get the hell out.

56:04.853 --> 56:06.187
Do you want to hear it or not?

56:06.980 --> 56:09.482
- Hear what?
- Okay, look,

56:09.566 --> 56:12.526
you're a superhero and you're lonely,
but you can't trust anyone

56:12.611 --> 56:14.278
'cause either
they'll expose your secret identity...

56:14.363 --> 56:16.614
Comic books this kid reads
all fucking day long.

56:16.698 --> 56:20.534
The point is there's only one way
a superhero can trust a stranger.

56:20.619 --> 56:23.955
And I can be that stranger.
You just gotta give me a chance.

56:24.039 --> 56:26.332
I know I can do it. I just need a few things.

56:28.210 --> 56:29.252
Like what?

56:31.255 --> 56:33.214
I need these things.

56:37.302 --> 56:39.136
What, are you fucking kidding me?
What the hell is this?

56:39.221 --> 56:41.055
It's everything I need.

56:41.139 --> 56:43.432
And you might have to screw
someone over, like Louie, or something.

56:43.517 --> 56:46.560
- Louie? Hey, Chris.
- Or somebody. It doesn't have to be Louie.

56:47.437 --> 56:48.813
- Tony!
- Tony.

56:49.648 --> 56:51.148
- Tony?
- I hate Tony.

56:51.233 --> 56:52.817
Yeah, fuck Tony. He's a scumbag.

56:53.026 --> 56:56.404
I swear, Dad, if you let me do this,
it's gonna work.

57:01.159 --> 57:02.243
Tony.

57:02.661 --> 57:05.913
Tony Romita, one of America's
most-wanted crime kingpins,

57:05.998 --> 57:07.748
was arrested in Queens today

57:07.833 --> 57:10.751
after a 911 call from someone
claiming to be a superhero...

57:10.836 --> 57:13.337
So, how are things going with Katie?

57:14.798 --> 57:15.840
Just peachy.

57:16.341 --> 57:17.925
We had a sleepover
and spent the whole night

57:18.010 --> 57:21.345
watching the entire Ugly Betty box set
and did pedicures.

57:21.930 --> 57:24.849
I'm telling you, the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

57:25.183 --> 57:28.894
I know. I was gonna tell her.
It's just, she seems so happy.

57:28.979 --> 57:31.188
- I don't know when's the right time.
- Now's your chance.

57:32.649 --> 57:34.984
- She didn't see that, did she?
- Hey, guys.

57:35.736 --> 57:37.486
- Hi!
- Hi, sweetie.

57:38.196 --> 57:40.614
Did you watch the TV?
The new superhero guy?

57:40.699 --> 57:42.533
- How cool is that?
- What?

57:42.701 --> 57:45.202
- Hey, look.
- Could you turn it up, please?

57:45.287 --> 57:46.704
- Check this out.
...dressed as Kick-Ass.

57:46.788 --> 57:51.667
But it seems that far from being put off,
this individual, who calls himself Red Mist,

57:51.752 --> 57:53.919
has decided to take
crime-fighting to a new level,

57:54.004 --> 57:57.214
as his actions last night proved.
Red Mist, how do you see it?

57:57.299 --> 57:59.800
Well, I guess folks have just
had enough of living in fear, you know,

57:59.885 --> 58:02.887
and Kick-Ass really proved that
one individual can make a difference.

58:02.971 --> 58:06.807
So if anyone out there needs help,
I'll be fighting crime 25/8.

58:06.892 --> 58:09.810
And I'm just one click away. Redmist. Org.

58:11.396 --> 58:14.982
Can we turn that off now?
What's so special about that guy?

58:15.067 --> 58:17.818
He caught, like, a drug dealer,
some most-wanted guy.

58:18.153 --> 58:19.862
You saw him bringing out
like a ton of stuff.

58:19.946 --> 58:21.489
That's pretty cool.

58:21.865 --> 58:24.200
He's got a way better costume
than Kick-Ass, too.

58:24.284 --> 58:25.743
- He's got a cape.
- Yeah.

58:25.827 --> 58:28.079
- Capes rock.
- Yeah, I'm kind of feeling the cape.

58:28.163 --> 58:29.872
He looks good.

58:30.582 --> 58:33.167
What, better than Kick-Ass?

58:33.251 --> 58:36.128
I mean, they're both kind of hot.
I just think Red Mist has a better body.

58:36.588 --> 58:38.172
Don't you think, Dave?

58:39.674 --> 58:41.342
Yeah, Dave, what do you think?

58:42.094 --> 58:44.762
Is he the kind of guy you'd go for,
with all that leather?

58:46.014 --> 58:49.225
No, Marty. No, he's not really my type.

59:43.405 --> 59:44.655
Kick-Ass!

59:45.782 --> 59:46.824
Red Mist.

59:48.326 --> 59:50.369
Shit! Fuck me, that kind of hurt.

59:51.663 --> 59:54.248
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm cool.

59:54.416 --> 59:57.543
I can't believe you're here, man.
Like, you're my hero.

59:58.211 --> 01:00:00.963
You inspired me. No Kick-Ass, no Red Mist.

01:00:01.173 --> 01:00:03.007
- Seriously.
- Wow.

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:07.094
- Hey, really?
- Straight up. And listen, if you...

01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:09.972
I don't know, if you wanted me
to be your sidekick or something...

01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:12.141
You wanna be my sidekick?

01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:15.853
Yeah, man!
You and me together, we would own!

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.355
You wanna go fight some crime?

01:00:18.773 --> 01:00:20.191
What you mean, like, right now?

01:00:20.775 --> 01:00:23.944
Yeah, man, come on.
I got something I wanna show you.

01:00:24.529 --> 01:00:25.946
I mean, like, to be honest with you,

01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:28.824
I only ever fight crime
between like 9:00 and 2:00, weekdays.

01:00:28.909 --> 01:00:31.785
So I'm gonna need to get back pretty soon.

01:00:35.373 --> 01:00:36.707
Sweet!

01:00:39.211 --> 01:00:41.921
- Is that yours?
- Meet the Mist Mobile.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:54.058
SatNav. Got my iPhone,
so I can check the websites

01:00:54.142 --> 01:00:56.519
for emergencies when I'm driving around.

01:00:56.603 --> 01:00:59.480
Got a little bit of mood lighting right there.

01:00:59.564 --> 01:01:01.774
Rearview camera, no big deal.

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:04.193
Check this, you're gonna fucking love this.

01:01:08.406 --> 01:01:09.907
The mist.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:14.578
Hey.

01:01:14.704 --> 01:01:16.539
That's right, we're superheroes.
You love us.

01:01:22.003 --> 01:01:24.380
- Smoke?
- No.

01:01:24.464 --> 01:01:27.299
I feel a little weed takes the edge off things
when I'm on patrol, you know?

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:31.387
Going up against a crowd
can get kind of scary, don't you think?

01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.098
Something wrong?

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.936
Yeah. You're so not how I expected.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.819
I got this e-mail from this chick.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.613
She said this guy's
been following her home from work.

01:01:50.198 --> 01:01:53.284
I got her address and stuff.
You wanna check it out?

01:01:53.368 --> 01:01:55.578
- Sure, why not?
- Cool.

01:02:03.128 --> 01:02:05.129
So we're sitting there totally naked, right?

01:02:05.297 --> 01:02:09.883
I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."

01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:21.103
- Yeah?
- Just got the text. He's on his way.

01:02:21.479 --> 01:02:22.980
He did very good.

01:02:23.648 --> 01:02:26.317
- Don't kill him till I get there.
- Right.

01:02:32.032 --> 01:02:34.867
Looks like reading all them comics
paid off, huh?

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.411
Your boy did good, Frankie.

01:02:39.497 --> 01:02:41.206
He's his father's son.

01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:54.136
I forgot.

01:03:25.585 --> 01:03:27.127
What the fuck?

01:03:31.257 --> 01:03:32.800
Shit.

01:03:34.219 --> 01:03:36.887
- Hey, what are you doing?
- There are people in there.

01:03:37.055 --> 01:03:39.390
Yeah. Shouldn't we call the fire...

01:03:41.226 --> 01:03:42.309
Shit!

01:04:00.912 --> 01:04:01.912
Mikey.

01:04:03.581 --> 01:04:04.832
Fuck.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.043
- Shit. Fuck.
- Red Mist!

01:04:09.963 --> 01:04:12.506
Red Mist! Red Mist!

01:04:19.472 --> 01:04:22.099
Hey. Hey, man, can you hear me? Hey.

01:04:26.104 --> 01:04:27.604
Jesus Christ!

01:04:34.946 --> 01:04:38.031
Red Mist! Red Mist!

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:40.617
Where the fuck are you?

01:05:15.236 --> 01:05:19.156
We gotta get the hell out of here.
Dude, move your fucking ass!

01:05:37.717 --> 01:05:39.676
Holy shit!

01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.846
- Did you see those bodies?
- Yeah, man.

01:05:45.767 --> 01:05:48.435
- Why'd you save the teddy?
- What?

01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:51.230
I don't know, man. Come on.

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:05.494
Come.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.746
What the hell are you doing, Frank?

01:06:07.831 --> 01:06:09.790
You know I can't be here.
What if somebody saw...

01:06:09.874 --> 01:06:12.125
That motherfucker Kick-Ass
burnt down my warehouse

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:13.961
and killed my men, Gigante.

01:06:14.045 --> 01:06:15.963
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Kick-Ass?

01:06:16.422 --> 01:06:18.048
- Are you sure?
- You gotta help me, Vic.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:21.385
My son was there, and he's still missing.

01:06:21.553 --> 01:06:25.556
They're all dead!
Everybody in the warehouse is dead.

01:06:26.933 --> 01:06:29.268
Put the gun down, Vic. It's Chris.

01:06:30.061 --> 01:06:31.520
Chris is Red Mist?

01:06:31.604 --> 01:06:33.814
It's not Red Mist you gotta worry about.
It's Kick-Ass.

01:06:33.898 --> 01:06:36.733
No, no, no, it's not.
Kick-Ass is just some geek, Dad.

01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:40.487
You don't have to worry about him.
You need to watch this.

01:06:42.073 --> 01:06:44.575
- Why, what does it do?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:44.659 --> 01:06:47.286
- What?
- God damn it, just sit down.

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:54.334
What are you doing?
What the hell is that thing?

01:06:54.419 --> 01:06:57.296
You bought this to spy on the nanny
when I was a kid. Don't you remember?

01:06:58.256 --> 01:07:00.674
- What, and you put it in the warehouse?
- Yeah, I thought it'd be cool

01:07:00.758 --> 01:07:03.719
to put the unmasking of Kick-Ass
on the Internet, okay?

01:07:04.012 --> 01:07:05.262
Watch.

01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:13.937
I told her, "Sit on my lap, we'll talk about
the first thing that comes up."

01:07:16.608 --> 01:07:19.401
- Yeah?
- Just got the text. He's on his way.

01:07:19.944 --> 01:07:21.320
He did very good.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:23.363
- Don't kill him till I get there.
- Right.

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:40.107
Who the hell is this guy?

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:42.401
I don't know, Dad.

01:08:43.194 --> 01:08:45.946
But Kick-Ass told me
we're not the only superheroes in town.

01:08:46.029 --> 01:08:47.863
Maybe he knows who this guy is.

01:08:49.783 --> 01:08:52.035
I want this place locked down.

01:08:52.662 --> 01:08:55.205
Nobody comes in, nobody goes out.

01:08:56.874 --> 01:08:58.792
Not until somebody finds this cocksucker

01:08:58.876 --> 01:09:01.962
and pulls his fucking lungs out
through his ass.

01:09:05.216 --> 01:09:07.718
Listen, they're on to you.

01:09:07.801 --> 01:09:10.178
Do you hear me? They're on to you.

01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:12.889
I thought they were looking for Kick-Ass.

01:09:12.974 --> 01:09:16.600
Not anymore. Gigante just put on
a little movie-show for us.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:21.273
Different superhero in a warehouse,
killing a whole bunch of D'Amico's guys.

01:09:21.607 --> 01:09:23.442
I'm gonna take a wild guess that was you.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:27.029
- I killed all the cameras.
- Apparently not.

01:09:27.113 --> 01:09:30.157
Look, bro, you need to get ghost.
Hide yourself quick.

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:32.075
Appreciate it.

01:09:36.456 --> 01:09:37.622
Mindy,

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.000
no more homework, baby doll.

01:09:41.252 --> 01:09:43.754
It's time for Frank D'Amico to go bye-bye.

01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:56.850
X-Men, the Fantastic Four,
right now, I envy the crap out of them.

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:02.147
Everything was out of control.
I didn't know what the hell to do.

01:10:02.356 --> 01:10:06.568
You okay, buddy? You look tired.
Early night tonight, maybe?

01:10:06.652 --> 01:10:08.528
And there was no one
I could talk to about it.

01:10:08.613 --> 01:10:10.363
Dave? Hello?

01:10:10.782 --> 01:10:12.657
Yeah, you bet I will.

01:10:15.119 --> 01:10:16.745
I'd never felt more alone.

01:10:20.666 --> 01:10:26.046
I'd always dreamed of being a superhero,
but this was a nightmare.

01:10:30.551 --> 01:10:33.678
It was time to stop wearing
this stupid costume.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:40.227
But there was one last thing I needed it for.

01:10:42.313 --> 01:10:46.108
What's the difference between
Spider-Man and Peter Parker?

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.277
Spider-Man gets the girl.

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:59.162
Hey, I'm Kick-Ass.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.086
I'm Kick-Ass. You mail me?

01:11:07.171 --> 01:11:08.547
Wait...

01:11:09.423 --> 01:11:11.675
Fuck! Fuck!

01:11:11.884 --> 01:11:15.011
Fucking freak in a mask!
Get out of my house!

01:11:15.096 --> 01:11:16.930
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

01:11:17.014 --> 01:11:18.890
No, no, no! It's me, it's me!

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:21.601
All right?
I was only trying to surprise you. I'm...

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:24.104
- Dave? What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

01:11:24.188 --> 01:11:27.107
- Why are you dressed as Kick-Ass?
- Because I am Kick-Ass.

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:31.236
- What are you talking about?
- And I'm also not gay.

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.906
- Fuck!
- And I'm an idiot and a shit friend.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:36.575
I lied to you, I know.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:39.077
- Oh, my God.
- I know. If it makes you feel any better,

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:43.290
I don't think you can hate me any more
right now than I hate myself.

01:11:43.875 --> 01:11:45.542
Please, I'm...

01:11:46.627 --> 01:11:48.837
Look, I'm really, really sorry.

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:56.720
I've never met anyone who's as beautiful
and as kind and lovely as you.

01:12:01.058 --> 01:12:02.767
You deserve better.

01:12:21.245 --> 01:12:23.246
- Dave.
- Yes?

01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:26.583
My mom has
the burglar alarm on downstairs,

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:29.336
so you should probably use the window.

01:12:34.926 --> 01:12:36.051
Or...

01:12:40.765 --> 01:12:42.432
Or you could just stay.

01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:45.185
Stay?

01:12:45.937 --> 01:12:47.437
What, like when we have a sleepover?

01:12:54.528 --> 01:12:57.197
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

01:12:59.283 --> 01:13:00.408
Wow.

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:31.982
We gotta get over it,

01:13:32.066 --> 01:13:35.902
on top of it, and then into it,
right in the middle of it.

01:13:35.987 --> 01:13:37.821
Daddy, I think I found one.

01:13:37.905 --> 01:13:41.199
It's perfect,
and they can deliver it in three days.

01:13:42.535 --> 01:13:44.744
It's 300,000 bucks.

01:13:44.829 --> 01:13:46.913
Can you think of anything else
you'd rather spend it on?

01:13:46.998 --> 01:13:49.249
Oh, my gosh!

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:52.711
- That is cool.
- Yeah.

01:13:54.005 --> 01:13:55.839
Add to shopping cart.

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:57.340
Okay.

01:14:00.011 --> 01:14:03.263
Out of Kick-Ass and Red Mist,
who do you think would win in a fight?

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:06.599
Why are they fighting? That seems stupid.

01:14:06.684 --> 01:14:10.603
- What do you think?
- I don't know, but I think Kick-Ass is cuter.

01:14:10.688 --> 01:14:11.938
Really?

01:14:12.857 --> 01:14:16.526
I, for one, would definitely
fuck his brains out if I got the chance.

01:14:18.529 --> 01:14:19.738
You would?

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:20.905
Definitely.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.784
Do you feel like checking out
that new Kate Hudson movie

01:14:24.869 --> 01:14:26.619
where she's like a shoe designer,
can't get a guy?

01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:30.081
- I think we could make the next showing.
- Hell, yeah.

01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:34.336
I guess we're not invited.

01:14:35.046 --> 01:14:36.963
All right. You know what? Come here.

01:14:37.048 --> 01:14:39.924
I'm going to convert you
to a comics reader right now.

01:14:40.384 --> 01:14:44.512
Suddenly, I understood why
superheroes only existed in comic books.

01:14:44.597 --> 01:14:47.974
I got why people didn't risk their lives
for strangers.

01:14:48.059 --> 01:14:50.352
Because for the first time in my life,

01:14:50.436 --> 01:14:52.896
I had something worth living for,

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.647
something to lose.

01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:58.735
Katie worried about me getting hurt,

01:14:58.819 --> 01:15:01.488
so I promised her
my Kick-Ass days were over.

01:15:01.572 --> 01:15:04.657
And the truth was I hardly missed it at all.

01:15:04.992 --> 01:15:07.744
I hadn't even checked
the website for, like, a week.

01:15:11.248 --> 01:15:13.249
Okay, I'm off then.

01:15:14.001 --> 01:15:16.461
- No Katie tonight?
- Tomorrow.

01:15:16.754 --> 01:15:20.006
Wednesdays, she's got
one of those volunteer things.

01:15:20.091 --> 01:15:22.842
You seem like a different guy,
you know that?

01:15:22.927 --> 01:15:27.097
Your mom would have been so happy
to see you out of your shell like this.

01:15:27.181 --> 01:15:28.848
Have a good night.

01:15:39.693 --> 01:15:42.112
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, what's going on?

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:44.322
I gotta do a Kick-Ass thing.

01:15:44.824 --> 01:15:47.158
What? I thought you were done with that.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.411
This is the last time. I totally swear.

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:51.788
I worry about you.

01:15:52.623 --> 01:15:54.999
Well, I wish you wouldn't worry.

01:15:55.334 --> 01:15:56.876
I can't help it. I do because I...

01:15:59.296 --> 01:16:01.131
I care about you a lot.

01:16:04.135 --> 01:16:06.302
I care about you a lot, too.

01:16:37.418 --> 01:16:38.751
This better be pretty serious, dude,

01:16:38.836 --> 01:16:41.254
'cause I promised my girlfriend
that I'm done with all this shit.

01:16:41.338 --> 01:16:43.965
How about both of us being dead?
Is that serious enough for you?

01:16:44.717 --> 01:16:46.926
Dead? How?

01:16:47.178 --> 01:16:49.387
It turns out
those dead guys from the warehouse

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:52.891
had some bad motherfuckers for friends,
and they think we did that shit.

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.976
There's a price on our heads, man.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.312
A price on our heads?
What is this, the Wild West?

01:16:57.396 --> 01:17:00.190
I'm not messing with you, dude.
They found out where I lived.

01:17:00.274 --> 01:17:01.983
They trashed my place. I'm fucking screwed.

01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:04.736
- And you're gonna be next, okay?
- What?

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:09.073
Shit.

01:17:10.367 --> 01:17:11.493
What do we do?

01:17:14.747 --> 01:17:17.540
Remember you mentioned
that there are other superheroes?

01:17:17.958 --> 01:17:19.000
Yeah?

01:17:19.919 --> 01:17:21.628
Well, do you think they can help us?

01:17:30.971 --> 01:17:33.389
Hot chocolate, extra marshmallows.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.938
Man, that looks even cooler
than it did in the picture.

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:44.359
Child, you know, that's because
in the picture, it didn't have Gatling guns.

01:17:44.652 --> 01:17:45.902
Nice job.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:47.820
I'm gonna take mine to bed, okay?

01:17:47.905 --> 01:17:50.323
Okay, baby doll. Sleep tight.

01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:52.909
Thanks. Kick-Ass?

01:17:54.328 --> 01:17:56.955
You go get dressed.
I'll tell him to meet us at Safe House B.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.165
We'll have our hot chocolate
when we get back.

01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:01.125
- Okay, Daddy.
- Come on.

01:18:10.594 --> 01:18:11.928
- There you go.
- All right.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:14.639
- Do you know where that is?
- No, but I'll just put it in the GPS.

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:17.267
- It's what it's for.
- All right, let's go.

01:18:18.477 --> 01:18:19.602
Shit.

01:19:55.532 --> 01:19:57.200
Okay, okay, okay.

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:09.629
Well, here you are and Red Mist, too.

01:20:15.135 --> 01:20:17.553
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you, sir.

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.764
Please, come in.

01:20:20.265 --> 01:20:21.599
After you.

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.854
Hit Girl, manners, honey.

01:20:29.608 --> 01:20:31.234
Hi, I'm Hit Girl.

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:38.241
No!

01:20:40.077 --> 01:20:42.286
Your ass is mine! Come on.

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:43.746
No, he's with me. He's okay.

01:20:43.831 --> 01:20:46.332
Shut the fuck up, kid.
Your daddy's the boss. You go home.

01:20:46.417 --> 01:20:49.669
Are you shitting me? No, he's fine.
He's with me.

01:20:49.962 --> 01:20:52.839
- Let him go.
- Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here.

01:20:52.923 --> 01:20:54.799
Hot damn. I always wanted one of these.

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:56.551
- You're seriously gonna take that?
- Yes.

01:20:56.635 --> 01:20:57.719
Come on, sweet cheeks.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.850
If you don't get your
wannabe superhero ass in the car...

01:21:03.934 --> 01:21:05.476
- That's funny.
...you're gonna have a lot of trouble

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:07.395
- on your hands.
- That's really funny. You're so fired.

01:21:07.479 --> 01:21:10.022
- Kick-Ass...
- Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

01:21:10.107 --> 01:21:12.358
- Get him in the van.
- Let go of me. Put me down.

01:21:12.443 --> 01:21:14.068
Kick-Ass, I'm sorry!

01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:16.779
- Get in the car.
- Get in there!

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.627
You better fire this asshole.

01:21:31.795 --> 01:21:33.296
Ignore him...

01:21:34.298 --> 01:21:35.631
A bazooka?

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.303
- Okay.
- We had a deal, Dad.

01:21:40.387 --> 01:21:43.055
We had a fucking deal
that I would get you the guy who did it,

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:46.768
and all I'm asking is you let Kick-Ass go.
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:50.521
Chris, you got to look at this
from my point of view. Okay?

01:21:50.606 --> 01:21:53.441
I gotta send a public service message
to the people out there

01:21:53.817 --> 01:21:56.319
that being a superhero
is bad for your health.

01:21:56.403 --> 01:21:59.030
And the Big motherfucker?
Nobody knows who he is.

01:21:59.114 --> 01:22:02.658
- Yeah, but that's not fair!
- Yeah, life's not fair, kid. Get over it.

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.118
What are you gonna do to them?

01:22:04.995 --> 01:22:07.330
You really wanna be a part of my business?

01:22:10.042 --> 01:22:11.083
Yeah.

01:22:11.168 --> 01:22:14.337
Then sit down, shut up and watch.

01:22:23.222 --> 01:22:26.432
Frank, we're ready. Enjoy the show.

01:22:26.517 --> 01:22:28.643
- Are you controlling this right now?
- I sure am.

01:22:28.727 --> 01:22:31.103
Big Brother, watch and learn.

01:22:31.772 --> 01:22:33.147
Welcome back. Breaking News.

01:22:33.232 --> 01:22:35.942
A worldwide web broadcast
of the New York superhero

01:22:36.026 --> 01:22:39.320
who calls himself Kick-Ass
is about to be shown live.

01:22:39.404 --> 01:22:42.240
Rumors have it that
this will be Kick-Ass's farewell appearance,

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:44.742
that he will announce
his retirement from crime fighting.

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:47.286
But as word of mouth continues to spread,

01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:48.871
Internet providers are predicting that

01:22:48.956 --> 01:22:52.542
it could be one of the most widely-viewed
live events in web history.

01:22:53.085 --> 01:22:54.168
Wait, where's Dave?

01:22:54.253 --> 01:22:56.254
There are no clues as yet
as to the exact nature...

01:22:56.338 --> 01:22:59.173
- Holy shit. Have you guys noticed...
- He's with Katie.

01:22:59.258 --> 01:23:01.425
- Obviously.
...come to a standstill to watch.

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:03.094
Why else would I be here?

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:06.556
There's no idea as to who is behind
the broadcast of this show,

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:09.183
but we could see
widespread server crashes...

01:23:10.102 --> 01:23:12.144
Dave, why didn't you tell me
this is what you were doing?

01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:14.105
You're on the news. Call me.

01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:17.441
We go now over live to the countdown
clock as we are moments away.

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:31.414
Show time.

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.376
Hello, boys and girls.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:37.295
Now, this...

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:40.006
Well, you know who this guy is.

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.925
And this guy here is Big Daddy.

01:23:43.594 --> 01:23:45.761
And these are my friends.

01:23:45.846 --> 01:23:47.889
Come on in, guys, say hello.

01:23:47.973 --> 01:23:51.350
Yeah, yeah, there they are. Hello, hello.

01:23:51.435 --> 01:23:54.896
Now Big Daddy and Kick-Ass
are gonna help us

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:59.525
show you why being a hero is a bad idea.

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:01.527
You know what a silent "K" is?

01:24:02.029 --> 01:24:03.905
That's when "K" is
at the beginning of the word,

01:24:03.989 --> 01:24:06.824
but you don't pronounce it.
Like in the word "Knuckleduster."

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:09.452
Show them what
a knuckleduster can do, guy.

01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:12.580
That must have hurt!
Let's see that again from the other side.

01:24:12.664 --> 01:24:15.041
Go on. Yeah, I think it did.

01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:19.587
Now in France, they say the word "stick"
like this, bÃ¢ton.

01:24:19.963 --> 01:24:21.547
We got some of Kick-Ass's bÃ¢tons.

01:24:21.632 --> 01:24:24.592
We're gonna show you what they can do.
Go ahead, boys.

01:24:27.804 --> 01:24:31.682
In America, we say "stick" like this.
Baseball bat.

01:24:32.142 --> 01:24:36.228
Which is very good
for hitting knees and stomachs.

01:24:36.313 --> 01:24:38.814
It's also good for hitting balls.

01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:41.859
Know what else we do?
We don't do them individually.

01:24:42.152 --> 01:24:45.905
We do them all together.
Gentlemen, please.

01:24:45.989 --> 01:24:49.033
Yeah. This looks very painful.

01:24:52.663 --> 01:24:56.666
Due to the distressing nature of the images,
we are unable to broadcast the events

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.584
currently streaming live on the Internet.

01:24:58.669 --> 01:25:00.920
- Fuck.
- No. No, no, no.

01:25:03.173 --> 01:25:07.259
Despite initial speculation that this may be
some kind of hoax or publicity stunt,

01:25:07.344 --> 01:25:10.596
it is now clear that the hostages
are in genuine danger,

01:25:10.681 --> 01:25:15.059
that all signs point to the intention to stage
a live execution in the next few minutes.

01:25:29.032 --> 01:25:32.785
Even with my metal plates
and my fucked-up nerve endings,

01:25:32.869 --> 01:25:35.538
I got to tell you, that hurt.

01:25:37.874 --> 01:25:39.375
The kerosene.

01:25:39.710 --> 01:25:41.252
Yes, the silent killer.

01:25:41.336 --> 01:25:45.214
But not half as much as the idea
of leaving everything behind.

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:46.966
Katie,

01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:48.384
my dad,

01:25:49.011 --> 01:25:50.386
Todd and Marty.

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:54.974
And all the things I'd never do,
like learn to drive,

01:25:55.642 --> 01:25:58.185
or see what me and Katie's kids
would look like

01:25:58.270 --> 01:26:00.187
or find out what happened on Lost.

01:26:00.272 --> 01:26:01.355
Spicy, spicy.

01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.065
And if you're reassuring yourself

01:26:03.150 --> 01:26:06.318
that I'm gonna make it through this
since I'm talking to you now,

01:26:07.237 --> 01:26:08.988
quit being such a smartass.

01:26:09.573 --> 01:26:15.119
Hell, dude, you never seen Sin City,
Sunset Blvd., American Beauty?

01:26:16.079 --> 01:26:19.123
And this, for all you cavemen out there,

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.792
is fire.

01:26:22.836 --> 01:26:24.003
No.

01:26:29.843 --> 01:26:30.968
I know.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.095
Fire. Fire is good.

01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:36.724
Fire is our friend.

01:26:37.601 --> 01:26:38.976
Yeah, yeah.

01:26:45.275 --> 01:26:46.317
Gentlemen,

01:26:48.695 --> 01:26:50.112
time to die.

01:26:55.952 --> 01:26:56.994
What the...

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:05.503
What the fuck just happened? Hey, hey.
Somebody find the lights.

01:27:06.046 --> 01:27:07.213
Hello!

01:27:08.465 --> 01:27:09.673
Jimmy.

01:27:18.517 --> 01:27:19.850
Jesus Christ.

01:27:20.977 --> 01:27:22.895
Bobby? Bobby?

01:27:56.346 --> 01:27:57.721
Get the lighter!

01:27:58.682 --> 01:28:01.183
It's on the floor right over there.
Find the lighter.

01:28:07.023 --> 01:28:08.274
I got it.

01:28:22.539 --> 01:28:25.249
- No!
- Take cover, child.

01:28:30.797 --> 01:28:34.550
Now switch to Kryptonite.

01:28:34.968 --> 01:28:36.343
Kryptonite.

01:29:05.832 --> 01:29:09.668
Go to Robin's Revenge!

01:29:09.753 --> 01:29:11.462
Robin, Robin.

01:29:56.633 --> 01:29:58.133
Show's over, motherfuckers.

01:30:03.515 --> 01:30:06.308
Yeah! I think I'm in love with her, dude.

01:30:06.685 --> 01:30:09.186
She looks like
she's about 11 years old, but...

01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:12.606
I can wait!
I solemnly vow to save myself for her.

01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:16.819
That should be really difficult for you.
Are you okay?

01:30:17.237 --> 01:30:18.362
Yeah.

01:30:37.674 --> 01:30:39.008
Good job.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.893
I'm so proud of you, baby doll.

01:30:52.605 --> 01:30:54.064
Are you okay?

01:30:59.779 --> 01:31:03.073
But getting shot, Daddy,
it hurt a lot more than when you did it.

01:31:04.993 --> 01:31:08.704
That's 'cause I used
low velocity rounds, child.

01:31:13.543 --> 01:31:15.419
You're the kindest daddy
in the whole world.

01:31:16.087 --> 01:31:17.546
No, I just...

01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:21.925
I love you.

01:31:27.223 --> 01:31:38.650
I love you, too, Daddy.

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:41.570
Sleep tight.

01:32:00.799 --> 01:32:02.091
What's your name?

01:32:03.176 --> 01:32:04.843
I mean your real name.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:07.805
A superhero never reveals his true identity.

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:10.474
What? Look, you can't go on...

01:32:12.102 --> 01:32:14.269
However you lived before,

01:32:17.857 --> 01:32:18.982
it's over.

01:32:21.403 --> 01:32:24.279
Is there anybody else? Your family or...

01:32:24.364 --> 01:32:26.698
Look, I can take care of myself.

01:32:27.450 --> 01:32:29.201
I saved your sorry ass.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:34.081
What about money, huh?
All right, 'cause you got to think long term.

01:32:34.165 --> 01:32:36.792
I've got $3 million in a suitcase.

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:40.295
That "long term" enough for you?

01:32:43.049 --> 01:32:45.259
It's not all about the money.

01:32:46.553 --> 01:32:47.886
I owe you.

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.473
If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead.

01:32:52.809 --> 01:32:54.810
And if it wasn't for you,

01:32:56.312 --> 01:32:57.479
my dad wouldn't be.

01:33:14.998 --> 01:33:16.123
Look,

01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:20.752
pack up whatever you need
and we'll go back to my place.

01:33:22.172 --> 01:33:24.214
I just need to clean my...

01:33:24.841 --> 01:33:26.008
Just go.

01:34:21.356 --> 01:34:25.901
I meant like pajamas and clothes and stuff.
You can't take that stuff to my house.

01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:27.819
You know what my dad
really would have wanted?

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:36.370
He would have wanted me
to finish what we started.

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.248
And that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

01:34:56.641 --> 01:34:58.892
Is this Frank D'Amico's place?

01:34:59.561 --> 01:35:01.228
All that security?

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:05.148
- Are you crazy?
- My mom already died for nothing.

01:35:06.526 --> 01:35:09.570
So I'm sure as hell
not gonna let my dad die for nothing, too.

01:35:11.948 --> 01:35:13.448
You can't do this on your own.

01:35:15.868 --> 01:35:17.119
Exactly.

01:35:19.872 --> 01:35:21.456
Do you wanna deal with owing my dad?

01:35:23.626 --> 01:35:25.794
Then shut the hell up
and pick your weapon.

01:35:35.013 --> 01:35:36.471
Is that what I think it is?

01:35:38.141 --> 01:35:39.474
Damn straight.

01:35:39.559 --> 01:35:42.060
And you better start
reading the instructions,

01:35:42.145 --> 01:35:45.606
'cause you're gonna be
using it in about five minutes.

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:56.033
Yo, listen up. We got five minutes,
then I want you back on your posts.

01:35:56.367 --> 01:35:57.868
And don't leave a mess.

01:36:12.592 --> 01:36:15.510
- Everything okay?
- Everything's all right, boss.

01:36:17.305 --> 01:36:19.181
I can't believe I got my gun back.
Look at that.

01:36:19.849 --> 01:36:21.516
You know, it's not the...

01:36:25.688 --> 01:36:27.022
Let her in.

01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:33.362
It's a little kid. What's the matter with you?

01:36:37.533 --> 01:36:39.368
You okay, sweetheart?

01:36:39.535 --> 01:36:40.577
I...

01:36:41.496 --> 01:36:43.121
I lost my mommy and daddy.

01:36:43.873 --> 01:36:45.415
She lost her mommy and daddy.

01:36:46.876 --> 01:36:49.086
You want to use my cell phone?

01:36:50.088 --> 01:36:52.422
Now can you remember the number?

01:37:01.683 --> 01:37:02.766
Help!

01:37:36.092 --> 01:37:38.510
Had I ever been a real superhero?

01:37:39.429 --> 01:37:42.055
The most I'd ever had to offer the world
was good intentions

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.434
and a slightly elevated capacity
to take a kicking.

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:50.772
With no power comes no responsibility.

01:37:51.983 --> 01:37:55.277
Except that wasn't true.

01:38:43.451 --> 01:38:44.659
- Did you hear that?
- Holy shit.

01:38:44.744 --> 01:38:46.495
Take cover, please.

01:40:11.664 --> 01:40:12.873
Shit.

01:40:13.833 --> 01:40:14.875
No.

01:40:16.919 --> 01:40:18.044
Shit.

01:40:21.132 --> 01:40:22.632
What the fuck?

01:40:27.179 --> 01:40:29.014
Get in here. Help me out!

01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:36.897
Holy fuck, Fashion, everybody's dead.

01:40:39.108 --> 01:40:41.067
She's behind the counter.
She's out of ammo, okay?

01:40:56.792 --> 01:40:58.919
Do you think they got them?

01:40:59.003 --> 01:41:00.962
If they didn't, he will.

01:41:02.298 --> 01:41:03.882
Get out there.

01:41:04.050 --> 01:41:05.050
Now?

01:41:05.134 --> 01:41:06.468
Yeah, now.

01:41:17.063 --> 01:41:18.313
What the fuck is going on?

01:41:18.397 --> 01:41:20.190
We got her trapped. She's unarmed.

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.567
So what in the hell
are you guys waiting for?

01:41:22.652 --> 01:41:24.277
- Go get her.
- Go on, man.

01:41:24.362 --> 01:41:26.237
- Go get her.
- I ain't got no fucking gun.

01:41:26.322 --> 01:41:27.989
I'm not going in.

01:41:29.659 --> 01:41:30.992
You do now.

01:41:32.036 --> 01:41:33.328
Now move.

01:41:53.265 --> 01:41:56.184
Fuck this shit. I'm getting the bazooka.

01:41:58.604 --> 01:42:01.356
Bazooka?

01:42:02.817 --> 01:42:05.318
It's only me, boss.
Everything's under control.

01:42:17.707 --> 01:42:21.960
Under control? You're grabbing
a fucking bazooka, you dumbass.

01:42:24.005 --> 01:42:25.046
Sir?

01:42:27.049 --> 01:42:28.216
Do it.

01:42:49.572 --> 01:42:50.780
I always wanted to say this.

01:42:53.534 --> 01:42:56.077
Say hello to my little friend!

01:43:27.610 --> 01:43:29.027
Dirty motherfuckers!

01:43:55.137 --> 01:43:56.471
Holy shit.

01:44:05.064 --> 01:44:07.440
That is one weird-sounding bazooka.

01:44:07.525 --> 01:44:08.608
Stu!

01:44:14.198 --> 01:44:15.323
Fuck!

01:44:25.417 --> 01:44:26.668
Get him.

01:44:35.928 --> 01:44:37.720
Playtime's over, kid.

01:44:38.931 --> 01:44:40.557
I never play.

01:44:41.767 --> 01:44:43.101
Oh, really?

01:46:00.930 --> 01:46:02.305
Ruin my business, huh?

01:46:04.225 --> 01:46:07.101
Kill every single fucking guy on my payroll?

01:46:37.091 --> 01:46:39.133
God, I wish I had a son like you.

01:46:46.058 --> 01:46:48.101
Time for a family reunion.

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:50.895
Hey.

01:46:51.647 --> 01:46:54.565
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

01:47:13.752 --> 01:47:15.753
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:47:17.298 --> 01:47:18.715
Time to go home.

01:48:55.771 --> 01:48:57.063
Thanks, Kick-Ass.

01:48:57.606 --> 01:48:58.940
My daddy,

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:03.611
he would have been proud of both of us.

01:49:14.206 --> 01:49:15.248
Dave.

01:49:16.291 --> 01:49:17.792
Dave Lizewski.

01:49:18.168 --> 01:49:19.460
I know that, dumbass.

01:49:30.848 --> 01:49:32.014
Mindy.

01:49:33.642 --> 01:49:35.184
Mindy Macready.

01:49:51.785 --> 01:49:53.536
- Have a good day. Bye.
- Bye.

01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:59.333
Mindy moved in with Marcus,
and he enrolled her at my school.

01:49:59.418 --> 01:50:01.043
- Bye.
- Good luck.

01:50:02.087 --> 01:50:05.965
First school she'd ever been to,
on the promise that I'd look out for her.

01:50:07.176 --> 01:50:08.176
Hey.

01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:09.760
Not that she needed me to.

01:50:09.845 --> 01:50:11.304
Hey, new kid.

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:12.680
Hi.

01:50:13.182 --> 01:50:14.640
Lunch money.

01:50:15.184 --> 01:50:16.309
Now.

01:50:24.193 --> 01:50:26.819
Kick-Ass was gone, but not forgotten.

01:50:27.946 --> 01:50:31.115
And my world was much safer
with all the new superheroes.

01:50:32.367 --> 01:50:34.577
They said I was their inspiration,

01:50:35.037 --> 01:50:37.788
but all I did was make a door
into a world I'd dreamed about

01:50:37.873 --> 01:50:39.874
since I was a little kid.

01:50:40.542 --> 01:50:42.960
A world full of superheroes, huh?

01:50:45.339 --> 01:50:47.381
As a great man once said,

01:50:50.219 --> 01:50:52.678
"Wait till they get a load of me."

01:50:53.305 --> 01:50:59.611
