17:43.453 --> 17:46.282
According to whom?The leader of Greylock.

Maya stays, I don't have to
reverse my executive order,

20:39.194 --> 20:41.109

cables in the back seat

23:41.289 --> 23:44.205
And though they may not sound
very controversial today,

23:44.248 --> 23:47.295
they landed the man
who printed them in prison.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.297
His name was John Peter Zenger,

23:49.340 --> 23:51.430
and he was accused of libeling

23:51.473 --> 23:52.779
New York's royal governor.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.389
In court,
Zenger confessed to the crime,

23:54.433 --> 23:57.044
but when it came time for
the jury to render a verdict,

23:57.087 --> 23:59.307
they did
the seemingly unthinkable.

23:59.350 --> 24:00.700
They found him not guilty.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.093
Zenger's case is often credited

24:03.137 --> 24:05.618
as the origin
of jury nullification,

24:05.661 --> 24:07.533
which is the power
of a jury--

24:07.576 --> 24:10.666
acting as the conscience
of the community--

24:10.710 --> 24:13.582
to acquit defendants
despite evidence of guilt

24:13.626 --> 24:15.497
in order to challenge
a specific law

24:15.541 --> 24:16.977
and prevent oppression.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.806
Judge Judge,
today you are the jury.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.416
You are the conscience

24:21.460 --> 24:23.940
of this community.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.986
And though there may be
evidence that my client broke

24:26.029 --> 24:29.555
Sarah Cooper's...
woefully inept law,

24:29.598 --> 24:31.078
I believe you'll see--

24:31.121 --> 24:33.559
like the jury in
John Peter Zenger's case did--

24:33.602 --> 24:35.822
that acquitting Maya Jiménez

24:35.865 --> 24:38.694
is the only decision
that serves real justice.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.698
I'd like to call the
arresting officer to the stand.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.744
In your professionalopinion,

24:44.787 --> 24:46.572
how common is it
for a law to treat

24:46.615 --> 24:47.964
minors and adults the same way?

24:48.008 --> 24:49.488
It doesn't happen much.In fact,

24:49.531 --> 24:51.620
only in extreme cases
will a prosecutor

24:51.664 --> 24:54.580
specifically ask for a child
to be tried as an adult.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.843
And this case
wouldn't be considered extreme

24:56.886 --> 25:00.586
were it not for this
ridiculous law, isn't that true?

25:00.629 --> 25:02.892

and it was an accident.

25:02.936 --> 25:06.548

into criminal behavior.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.028
Her mother was...Objection.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.377
Your Honor, whatever
my client's mother

25:09.420 --> 25:11.466
may have done is entirely

25:11.510 --> 25:13.033
irrelevant to this case.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.774
If we all had to answer
for the sins of our parents,

right now.
