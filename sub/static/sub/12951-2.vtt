00:02.936 --> 00:05.404
CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow

00:05.405 --> 00:06.305
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.306 --> 00:09.332
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.

00:09.409 --> 00:11.243
Also a double agent with CIA.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.611
Get down!

00:12.612 --> 00:14.747
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.248
Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.

00:17.283 --> 00:19.151
My guardian angel.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.748
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.553
A secret organization
dealing in espionage,

00:26.626 --> 00:29.595
extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.

00:29.662 --> 00:32.654
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.600
SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.195
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.270 --> 00:38.837
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.838 --> 00:41.338
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.242
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.243 --> 00:46.474
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

00:46.546 --> 00:49.140
recently turned herself in
to the CIA.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.916
Mom?

00:50.917 --> 00:52.317
Intel indicates

00:52.318 --> 00:55.151
she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

00:56.356 --> 00:59.189
The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother

00:59.259 --> 01:01.226
remains unknown.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.661
Previously on "Alias"...

01:02.662 --> 01:04.663
The only way SD-6
will let you live

01:04.664 --> 01:06.632
is if you destroy
the life you've got.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.767
If you don't go public
with this,

01:08.768 --> 01:10.169
you'll be a dead man.

01:10.170 --> 01:12.471
I'm scared.

01:12.472 --> 01:14.972
I know.

01:17.610 --> 01:20.110
You ready?

01:26.119 --> 01:29.111
Are you suggesting
that I kill my wife?

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.856 --> 02:38.123
Yeah?

02:38.124 --> 02:40.624
On my way.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.398
I'm Assistant Director Kendall.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.606
I'm told
you want to cooperate.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.215
Hey, Mr. Bristow.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.716
Come on in.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.986
Let me ask you a question.

03:07.987 --> 03:11.047
Let's say you're at your
favorite neighborhood restaurant

03:11.124 --> 03:12.891
with some friends.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.593
Or whatever.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.358
You like to go there,
you like the food.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.731
What color are the walls?

03:19.732 --> 03:23.828
I'm not really
into interior decorating.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.206
I'll get Syd.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.612
Syd, your dad's here.

03:35.682 --> 03:38.549
Okay.
I'll be right out.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.656
To the Vietnamese and Chinese,

03:44.657 --> 03:48.115
the color white
means death and bad fortune.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.462
Try red.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.963
- Really?
- Hi.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.867
Will's sentencing is at 2:00.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.903
- I'll meet you there?
- Yeah.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.404
Did you hear about Will?

04:00.640 --> 04:01.974
The story he made up?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.508
He was high the whole time.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.009
Yes, I saw that on the news.
Unfortunate.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.246
You know what I want
to do to the guy

04:07.247 --> 04:08.547
who introduced Will to heroin?

04:08.548 --> 04:10.182
I want to kill him.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.417
With my hands.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.253
I can imagine.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.988
I'll see you at the courthouse.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.488
I'm gonna go buy some red paint.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.164
I thought you'd want to know

04:26.165 --> 04:28.634
your mother's transfer
is complete.

04:28.635 --> 04:29.768
She's being held

04:29.769 --> 04:32.329
at a Joint Task Force
facility downtown.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.773
The idea that the CIA
is willing to work

04:34.774 --> 04:37.242
with Irina Derevko is insane.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.744
Worse, it's naive.

04:38.745 --> 04:42.772
Your mother didn't just
conveniently turn herself in.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.916
This is all part
of a manipulation.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.551
She's their problem now.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.186
She's not yours.

04:48.187 --> 04:50.917
And she's not mine.

04:52.225 --> 04:54.725
You okay?

04:55.428 --> 04:57.763
My shoulder's healing,
if that's what you mean.

04:57.764 --> 05:01.427
It's not, actually.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.602
Thanks for asking.
I'm fine.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.009
I don't support
the death penalty,

05:18.084 --> 05:21.952
but I hope that she dies
for all that she's done.

05:22.021 --> 05:24.521
I really do.

05:33.700 --> 05:38.194
Arvin Sloane is a man
of integrity and courage.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.504
As the head of SD-6,

05:39.505 --> 05:43.066
he brilliantly executed
Alliance policy,

05:43.142 --> 05:46.475
helping to slowly and invisibly

05:46.546 --> 05:49.106
seize control of world markets,

05:49.182 --> 05:52.117
governments, and technology.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.746
Now, as the newest
full partner of The Alliance,

05:55.822 --> 05:58.450
I feel confident
that he will play a major part

05:58.524 --> 06:01.357
in shaping that policy

06:01.427 --> 06:04.157
for years to come.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.964
I speak for everyone

06:05.965 --> 06:09.924
when I offer you my condolences
on the passing of your wife.

06:12.805 --> 06:13.739
Thank you.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.007
We respect and admire
your willingness

06:16.008 --> 06:19.944
to do what was necessary
in that matter.

06:20.012 --> 06:24.346
You have been made aware
of the initiation procedure?

06:24.417 --> 06:26.318
I have.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.053
And the reasons for it?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.554
Yes.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.760
Welcome to The Alliance.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.435
Sloane got back
from London last night,

06:43.436 --> 06:45.837
a full partner of The Alliance.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.338
Emily knew the truth.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.901
Her death and his immediately
being let in.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.777
I am convinced he killed
his wife to get that seat.

06:54.847 --> 06:57.407
Killing his wife
wouldn't surprise me.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.281
SD-6 and The Alliance believe
that my mother's in hiding.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.887
They know
that Khasinau's dead.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.188
They're correct to assume

07:03.189 --> 07:05.490
what's left of her organization
is vulnerable.

07:05.491 --> 07:07.225
The Alliance
wants whatever assets

07:07.226 --> 07:08.727
they can get their hands on.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.128
Where are they starting?

07:10.129 --> 07:12.962
My mother used blackmail.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.592
Extensively.

07:15.668 --> 07:18.501
In running her operation,
she would get dirt on people.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.839
Powerful, important people.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.968
And coerce them into doing
whatever she needed.

07:24.043 --> 07:25.677
Pornographic photographs,

07:25.678 --> 07:28.738
illegally obtained
audio files, names, dates.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.016
They're all
on one computer disk.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.918
What does The Alliance want?
The dirt?

07:32.919 --> 07:34.319
To hear Sloane tell it,

07:34.320 --> 07:36.982
it's all about God and country.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.854
It is our obligation
to retrieve the disk.

07:39.926 --> 07:43.623
What you're looking at
is the El Sebkba hotel in Rabat.

07:43.696 --> 07:46.097
A Derevko operative
named Mohammed Naj

07:46.098 --> 07:48.066
lives and works
out of the fourth floor.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.068
Early last week,
the blackmail disk

07:50.069 --> 07:52.070
was taken to a vault
at that location.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.339
The operation is simple.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.173
Break into the vault.
Retrieve the disk.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.410
My flight's at 6:00.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.378
We'll make contact
with a countermission

08:00.379 --> 08:02.879
- no later than 3:00.
- Okay.

08:03.883 --> 08:04.950
How's Weiss?

08:04.951 --> 08:06.585
He's still in the hospital.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.553
The doctors say
he's gonna be okay.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.284
Until then,
I've got to feed his fish.

08:11.357 --> 08:12.390
Yeah?

08:12.391 --> 08:14.359
Yes, let him through.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.927
It's Kendall.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.230
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.432
- We have to hear him out.
- He arrested me.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.133
He's in control of operations.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.634
Mr. Vaughn, Agent Bristow.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.371
Did you clear this meeting?

08:26.372 --> 08:27.639
No, I'm sorry.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.908
I don't have time
to go through channels.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.810
There's been
an interesting development

08:31.811 --> 08:32.943
regarding your mother.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.413
As you know,
she surrendered to the CIA

08:35.414 --> 08:37.249
and claims to want to cooperate.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.549
So she's handed over her
agency's operations manual?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.621
No, and she won't talk about it.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.122
She won't talk to us
about anything.

08:45.157 --> 08:47.325
Then that's the end
of the story.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.160
That's the interesting
development.

08:49.161 --> 08:52.995
It seems that the only person
she's willing to talk to is you.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.066
Then you're out of luck.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.135
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to talk...

08:57.136 --> 08:58.803
You can't compel Agent...

08:58.804 --> 09:00.405
- I can.
- Are we through?

09:00.406 --> 09:02.474
Ms. Bristow, I don't
have to remind you

09:02.475 --> 09:04.576
this is a matter
of national security.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.745
Yeah, we're through.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.011
I'll wait to hear from you.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.021
Just so we're clear,
Mr. Vaughn,

09:16.022 --> 09:17.956
I know all about
your participation

09:17.957 --> 09:21.256
in busting Agent Bristow
out of federal custody.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.562
Convince her
to talk to her mother

09:23.563 --> 09:25.564
or face charges
for obstructing justice

09:25.565 --> 09:28.065
and harboring a fugitive.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.501
Guess it's 2-for-1 day
on blackmail.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.134
So, Mr. Tippin...

10:09.208 --> 10:11.802
do you understand what you are
being accused of?

10:11.877 --> 10:13.244
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.547
Felony charge
of heroin possession,

10:15.548 --> 10:17.816
misdemeanor count
of being under the influence

10:17.817 --> 10:19.184
of a controlled substance.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.952
How are you pleading?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.020
Guilty.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.521
Under proposition 36,
you are to receive probation

10:24.523 --> 10:26.224
and are hereby ordered
to complete

10:26.225 --> 10:28.693
a certified
drug-treatment program.

10:28.694 --> 10:32.289
In addition, you must complete
100 hours of community service.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.199
Fail to meet
any of these requirements,

10:34.200 --> 10:37.328
and you will serve time.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.070
It's a subvocal mike.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.596
We can hear what's going on
between you and Dixon.

10:41.674 --> 10:42.974
As soon as you can,

10:42.975 --> 10:45.343
go radio silent with him
so you and I can talk.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.045
Call waiting for spies.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.046
Yeah.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.781
The blackmail disk is in a safe

10:49.782 --> 10:51.483
in Naj's suite
on the fourth floor.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.146
As soon as you get it,
you'll deliver it to this man.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.220
Richard Schmidt.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.721
He's under a diplomatic cover
at the Rabat Embassy.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.555
He'll be waiting for you
on the third floor.

11:00.626 --> 11:03.857
Now, Sloane is obviously
looking for something specific.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.163
We don't know what.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.365
Schmidt will scan the disk,
analyze what's on it,

11:07.366 --> 11:08.667
and spit up a bogus copy

11:08.668 --> 11:11.364
that's close enough
to the original to fool Sloane.

11:11.437 --> 11:14.406
That's the disk
you'll deliver to SD-6.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.274
Okay.

11:16.275 --> 11:18.775
Or...

11:19.645 --> 11:22.842
You could ask your mother
about the contents of the disk.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.690
Kendall must really be
putting on the pressure

11:31.691 --> 11:32.991
for you to ask me that.

11:32.992 --> 11:36.291
Yeah, he is.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.563
But I've been thinking
about it myself.

11:38.564 --> 11:39.731
You're good at this.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.332
This is
what you're trained for.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.833
Compartmentalizing
your emotions.

11:43.903 --> 11:46.531
- You do it with Sloane.
- This isn't the same.

11:49.608 --> 11:52.304
Syd, I would never
force you to do this.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.579
I would never make this
an official request,

11:54.580 --> 11:57.481
but I also know that
what you want more than anything

11:57.550 --> 11:58.850
is to destroy SD-6

11:58.851 --> 12:00.585
and bring an end
to The Alliance.

12:00.586 --> 12:02.987
If she can help us,
then why not use her?

12:02.988 --> 12:05.488
Because I can't.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.858
Because I won't.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.256
Maybe you could
shut down with her.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.832
I couldn't.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.738
I'll talk to you from Rabat.

12:22.174 --> 12:24.109
I spoke with Agent Bristow,

12:24.110 --> 12:26.874
and she has no intention
of speaking with her mother.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.513
Sir, I know.
It's unacceptable.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.348
Let me remind you,
you're asking...

12:30.349 --> 12:32.117
You don't need to remind me.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.485
The woman abandoned Sydney.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.286
I know you have your own issues.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.279
- Yes, and so do you.
- I read the reports.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.991
Irina Derevko shot Sydney.

12:39.992 --> 12:42.260
Point-blank range.
She could have killed her.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.855
But didn't kill her.
Did not.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.534
That woman...

12:49.535 --> 12:52.231
48 hours ago,
was 100% pure bad news,

12:52.304 --> 12:53.471
but now she's ours.

12:53.472 --> 12:55.607
And there is just a chance,
Mr. Vaughn,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.108
that she has turned.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.577
When she got done
with my father,

13:04.650 --> 13:08.142
he could only be identified
by his dental records.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.524
Yes.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.025
Nevertheless,
she headed up an organization

13:15.027 --> 13:17.723
that controlled people
who influenced policy decisions

13:17.797 --> 13:20.297
at NATO, the U.N.,
the World Bank.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.567
Even with all our resources,
the CIA doesn't know

13:22.568 --> 13:24.269
the full scope of her operation.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.604
The key players,
their methods, acquisitions.

13:26.605 --> 13:30.097
If I can get her to talk,

13:30.176 --> 13:34.112
I don't want you to ask Sydney
to see her ever again.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.115
Well, I'm not gonna make
that promise.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.748
You're not the easiest guy
to work with, are you?

13:43.522 --> 13:45.757
No.

13:45.758 --> 13:48.258
No, definitely not.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.845
I have a 20
on Naj and his bodyguard.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.079
Okay, I'm coming in.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.580
Okay, Syd, we're on.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.452
Syd, you close?

14:14.453 --> 14:16.953
I'm right behind you.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.403
You always do that.

14:32.404 --> 14:33.304
What?

14:33.305 --> 14:35.106
What you just did
with your hair.

14:35.107 --> 14:36.341
It's your thing.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.642
I don't have a thing.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.143
It is.
It's your thing.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.750
If the rest
of the hotel is like this,

14:45.751 --> 14:48.251
sara perfetto.

14:48.687 --> 14:50.722
And how may I help you?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.223
My name
is Beatrice Cunelli.

14:53.259 --> 14:56.854
Mio Marito Silvio and I
are in town for three months

14:56.929 --> 14:59.523
while I recover
from a ridiculo

14:59.598 --> 15:01.866
jet-skiing accident
off the coast of Mallorca.

15:01.867 --> 15:06.270
Precedente travel agent
booked us into the Daram,

15:06.338 --> 15:09.136
which turns out to be total...

15:09.208 --> 15:12.644
Now that I see this,
I call Silvio and tell him

15:12.711 --> 15:14.946
bring the bags right over.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.614
Your bags?

15:17.783 --> 15:20.151
We were at a cocktail party
last night,

15:20.152 --> 15:22.020
and the consul general said

15:22.021 --> 15:24.546
that he simply raves
about this place.

15:24.623 --> 15:28.081
Naturally, I called and booked
a suite immediatamente.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.660
There must be
some mistake, mademoiselle.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.163
We are completely full.

15:33.666 --> 15:37.466
Do me a favor, darling.
Check for me.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.733
Beatrice Cunelli.

15:40.806 --> 15:42.807
Yes, of course,

15:42.808 --> 15:45.308
but I'm pretty sure it's...

15:46.145 --> 15:48.670
Reservation
for Mr. and Mrs. Cunelli.

15:48.747 --> 15:51.247
I hope it's a room with a view.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.724
Oh!

15:59.725 --> 16:01.659
Dixon, I've got the key
to Naj's suite.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.160
I'm on my way.

16:52.811 --> 16:55.644
I'm interested
in a computer disk

16:55.714 --> 16:58.615
containing information
used for blackmail.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.482
We believe you're familiar
with this item.

17:08.594 --> 17:11.392
That's an implied question.
I'll make it clear for you.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.963
Are you familiar
with this item?

17:25.711 --> 17:27.779
I know you want
to see your daughter.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.408
I can guarantee you
that is never gonna happen

17:30.482 --> 17:32.583
unless she knows
you're cooperating.

17:32.584 --> 17:33.584
Prove yourself.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.315
Give Sydney
a reason to see you.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.016
Sydney?

17:39.091 --> 17:41.591
Interesting.

17:43.896 --> 17:48.526
Agent Bristow is in Rabat now
seeking to recover the list.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.194
Is there anything
she should know?

17:53.839 --> 17:56.808
Next to the safe,
there's a fire alarm.

17:58.510 --> 18:02.207
If you want to protect her,
tell her to pull it first,

18:02.281 --> 18:04.215
then open the safe.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.983
Why?

18:05.984 --> 18:07.985
I've given you a gift...

18:07.986 --> 18:11.478
and all you get from me is one.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.860
You look just like him.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.003
Through with the prisoner.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.732
To find the safe,
you're gonna need this.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.202
It looks like
just a normal metal detector.

18:58.203 --> 19:00.899
It is. We're going
old school on this one.

19:04.176 --> 19:07.043
Now, the safe is a Waldrasen.
It's an original.

19:07.112 --> 19:09.013
The craftsmanship is incredible.

19:09.014 --> 19:11.349
Lucky for you,
the same can be said about this.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.444
Do you know those stethoscopes
outlaws would use to rob banks?

19:14.520 --> 19:16.387
You know,
the horses and the guns?

19:16.388 --> 19:18.122
Well, I studied how those work,

19:18.123 --> 19:20.224
being a bit
of an outlaw myself.

19:20.225 --> 19:23.490
Basically, this,
super-amplified version of that.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.863
You just place this
over the dial.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.265
This part right here.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.894
You type in 7-9-3.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.493
That spells "Syd,"
in case you forget.

19:32.571 --> 19:34.572
'Cause the numbers
and the letter...

19:34.573 --> 19:36.140
You know that.

19:36.141 --> 19:39.338
Basically, this will
do the rest for you.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.183
I need to talk to Agent Bristow.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.551
She's not radio silent.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.180
If we try and communicate,
her SD-6 partner could hear us.

19:49.254 --> 19:52.189
If we don't,
she might trigger the alarm.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.919
The locking mechanism
is a set of wheels.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.894
The trick is to line up
each notch with contact points.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.064
Once each notch is lined up,

20:00.065 --> 20:02.033
a part of the combination
will appear.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.534
When they all line up,
the lock will open.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.231
Almost there.
Going radio silent.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.539
Just be careful.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.236
- Now.
- Freelancer, this is boot camp.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.710
Go ahead, boot camp.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.211
Sydney, do not open the safe.

20:15.247 --> 20:15.947
What?

20:15.948 --> 20:18.448
Is there a fire alarm
on the wall?

20:22.654 --> 20:23.521
Yes.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.056
Listen to me.
It's a failsafe.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.787
Do not open the safe
until after you pull the alarm.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.027
We had no intel on a failsafe.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.462
Where'd you get
this information?

20:31.463 --> 20:34.091
Vaughn spoke with your mother.
The intel came from her.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.761
It's her disk.
She's familiar with the vault.

20:37.836 --> 20:40.238
And what if there's not?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.440
I'm just supposed
to pull the fire alarm?

20:42.441 --> 20:44.609
I know this sounds crazy,
but I think it's for real.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.811
Vaughn, she wants me dead.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.645
If that were true, she would
have killed you in Barcelona.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.682
Did you talk
to my father about this?

20:51.683 --> 20:54.277
Two minutes ago on the phone
while we were waiting.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.015
- What did he say?
- Your dad?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.556
The answer is no!

20:58.557 --> 21:00.224
I'm asking that you consider it.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.225
Consider the source!

21:01.226 --> 21:03.561
This woman is not to be trusted!

21:03.562 --> 21:06.554
Under no circumstances
discuss this with my daughter.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.499
I don't think your father
can think clearly

21:09.568 --> 21:12.036
- where your mother's concerned.
- And you can?

21:12.037 --> 21:13.204
I'm trying.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.072
She has nothing to gain
by lying.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.769
Ms. Bristow, I want you
to pull that fire alarm.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.720
Sydney...

21:29.721 --> 21:32.221
I'd do it.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.066
Agent Bristow, pull that alarm.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.719
See what I mean?

22:11.563 --> 22:14.327
Dixon, I've tripped
some kind of alarm.

22:14.399 --> 22:15.399
What do you see?

22:15.400 --> 22:17.900
Naj and his bodyguard
are on their way up.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.805
Just look for the disk.
I'll handle Naj.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.203
This is Freelancer.
I've got the blackmail disk.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.671
What's your position?

22:53.672 --> 22:55.740
Leaving the suite,
heading for the stairs.

22:55.741 --> 22:58.241
- On my way.
- We got it.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.783
Do you have it?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.421
Syd, do you have the disk?

23:10.422 --> 23:11.489
Yes.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.990
Good.

23:17.095 --> 23:19.163
- Did you get it?
Negative.

23:19.164 --> 23:20.464
What?

23:20.465 --> 23:24.026
I repeat, the disk
was not transferred.

23:24.102 --> 23:25.936
Satellite feed is up.

23:25.937 --> 23:28.906
Sloane wants
the information ASAP.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.474
Good job, Syd.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.517
Alain.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.552
Arvin.

23:41.553 --> 23:42.987
I thought you should know

23:42.988 --> 23:46.014
that SD-6 is in possession
of the blackmail disk.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.726
Thank you.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.528
And more good news.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.596
You know that gentleman
we discussed?

23:52.597 --> 23:54.899
Petr Fordson.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.700
Well, we now have
information on him.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.270
Photographs.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.941
No.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.010
Of his daughter.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.412
He's willing to pay a high price
to keep them private.

24:11.316 --> 24:14.683
Well, if you saw them,
you'd know why.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.915
I leave for Helsinki tonight.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.515
I'm seeing Fordson myself.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.063
I want to talk to my mother.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.365
I hate her.
I don't understand her.

24:28.366 --> 24:30.367
I think she's a monster.

24:30.368 --> 24:32.369
But if she can help us
bring an end to SD-6,

24:32.370 --> 24:33.737
then what I think
is irrelevant.

24:33.738 --> 24:35.473
I'm not so sure.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.340
What?

24:36.341 --> 24:38.342
I've been thinking about it.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.544
- Is this about my father?
- He has a point.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.947
He can't think clearly
where she's concerned.

24:42.948 --> 24:44.949
Vaughn, I screwed up.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.817
We don't know what she's after.

24:47.886 --> 24:50.187
AII I know is
she offered good intel,

24:50.188 --> 24:52.122
and I didn't choose to use it.

24:52.123 --> 24:55.559
Now SD-6
has the blackmail disk.

24:55.627 --> 24:58.255
They've got it now,
we don't, and it's my fault.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.830
I know I'm the one
who tried to convince you

25:00.899 --> 25:04.460
to see your mother,
to be unemotional with her.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.936
I thought I could do it.

25:05.937 --> 25:09.065
See her and be
as cold-blooded as she is.

25:10.609 --> 25:13.237
It's hard to explain...

25:13.311 --> 25:16.803
what it feels like...

25:16.882 --> 25:19.510
sitting across from her.

25:20.485 --> 25:23.215
What she did to my family.

25:23.288 --> 25:25.356
To my father.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.558
But she's your mother, Sydney.

25:27.559 --> 25:30.187
With all she's done,
she is your mother.

25:32.564 --> 25:35.328
Vaughn, if you're
worried about me...

25:38.570 --> 25:41.070
You don't need to be.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.020
I called you in
to say thank you.

25:59.124 --> 26:00.658
We now have the disk.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.259
And it's because of you.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.461
What was on it?

26:04.462 --> 26:07.022
Horrible things.
Private moments.

26:07.098 --> 26:10.158
The disk is a collection.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.602
A physical manifestation
of human weakness.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.732
A tool that some people,

26:16.808 --> 26:18.342
that your mother used

26:18.343 --> 26:20.843
to extract favors
from those in power.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.013
Which, Sydney...

26:23.014 --> 26:27.144
is something that I wanted
to talk to you about.

26:29.854 --> 26:31.855
Your mother.

26:31.856 --> 26:34.258
What about her?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.594
You saw her in Taipei.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.095
Yes.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.465
Well...

26:41.466 --> 26:48.531
I just wanted to remind you
that I am here for you

26:48.607 --> 26:51.107
if you ever need to talk.

26:52.844 --> 26:55.344
Thank you.

26:58.249 --> 27:00.017
I wanted to cut off my hand.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.782
Did he say anything else
about the blackmail disk?

27:02.854 --> 27:04.221
Why The Alliance wanted it?

27:04.222 --> 27:06.156
No. I thought
you'd have seen it.

27:06.157 --> 27:10.287
No. Sloane sent the disk to
Alliance headquarters in London.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.862
I'll see if I can find out
whatever was on the disk

27:12.864 --> 27:15.389
and why it was so important.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.967
How are you going to do that?

27:19.537 --> 27:22.037
I'll ask Mom.

27:24.876 --> 27:26.844
You've agreed to see her.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.245
- Yes.
- Sydney.

27:28.246 --> 27:31.306
- She is the enemy.
- And so is Sloane.

27:31.383 --> 27:34.682
If the devil herself
wants to help me, fine by me.

27:34.753 --> 27:37.381
She has never been interested
in helping you.

27:37.455 --> 27:39.623
She told me to pull the alarm.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.825
That could have
made things worse.

27:41.826 --> 27:45.387
Sydney,
you're smarter than this.

27:45.463 --> 27:48.626
Your mother wants you
to think she's your ally,

27:48.700 --> 27:50.367
that she can help you.

27:50.368 --> 27:55.601
Her intel might even
be accurate once, twice.

27:55.674 --> 27:59.337
But the minute
you start depending on her,

27:59.411 --> 28:01.911
she will gut you.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.561
Will,
what happened to your face?

28:17.562 --> 28:18.962
You know the one thing

28:18.963 --> 28:21.523
they don't tell you
about doing community service?

28:21.599 --> 28:22.266
Sunblock.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.667
Oh, buddy.

28:23.668 --> 28:24.802
How'd it go?

28:24.803 --> 28:27.237
Hanging out with a bunch
of drug addicts

28:27.238 --> 28:30.230
picking up the newspaper I used
to write for with a stick?

28:30.308 --> 28:31.642
Not good.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.510
Oh, I saw you
at the gas station

28:33.511 --> 28:35.779
over on National with some guy.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.614
Dark suit, 50.

28:37.615 --> 28:39.750
Oh.

28:39.751 --> 28:42.186
That was
the liquor-license guy.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.987
Wait a minute.
Like a Mafia guy?

28:43.988 --> 28:45.989
- Yeah, kind of.
- Francie.

28:45.990 --> 28:49.016
It's going to take me six months
to get a legitimate license.

28:49.094 --> 28:52.063
You're giving me grief
about doing drugs?

28:52.130 --> 28:54.198
- It's not the same thing.
- No, it's not.

28:54.199 --> 28:56.467
You're involved
with organized crime.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.993
You have no idea what it takes
to start a restaurant.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.800
I have to deal with contractors
and subcontractors.

29:01.873 --> 29:04.241
I know. I used to work
at the metro desk.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.443
I wrote two dozen
pieces on restaurants.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.645
Health department ratings,
code requirements.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.781
I just need a liquor license.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.410
What you need is someone who
knows how the system works,

29:13.485 --> 29:16.079
someone who can
help you navigate.

29:16.154 --> 29:17.354
What you need is me.

29:17.355 --> 29:20.290
Former drug-addict reporter,

29:20.358 --> 29:22.858
and sometimes
lobster impersonator.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.962
I'll help you out.

29:27.232 --> 29:30.224
To get to the facility
where your mother's being held,

29:30.301 --> 29:32.035
you'll go through
a secret entrance.

29:32.036 --> 29:34.505
Start at the southwest
corner of Riverside Park.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.440
Head east until you pass
a homeless man

29:36.441 --> 29:37.808
in front of a statue.

29:37.809 --> 29:40.177
He'll have a sign indicating
he's a Vietnam vet.

29:40.178 --> 29:42.146
He'll have a cup.
Drop a coin in it.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.945
Freelancer
requests covert entry.

29:47.819 --> 29:49.820
Copy that.
Routing her in.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.188
At Riverside, turn left.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.823
The traffic cameras
will identify

29:52.824 --> 29:55.486
if you're being visually
or electronically tracked.

30:01.666 --> 30:02.299
She's clean.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.901
In the underpass
beneath the 134,

30:03.902 --> 30:06.402
there's an emergency phone.
It's out of order.

30:06.437 --> 30:07.304
If it's ringing,

30:07.305 --> 30:09.306
you've been cleared
of all surveillance.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.008
This is a series
of 3-digit codes.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.343
Memorize them.
They rotate weekly.

30:13.344 --> 30:15.813
After the phone rings,
enter the appropriate code.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.612
In front of you, there's an
industrial shipping container.

30:18.683 --> 30:21.345
On the back side,
a door will unlock.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.788
You'll go down
a steep set of stairs

30:24.789 --> 30:26.690
through a series of checkpoints,

30:26.691 --> 30:28.392
and a quarter mile later,

30:28.393 --> 30:31.294
you'll be
at the operations center.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.569
Agent Bristow?

30:38.570 --> 30:41.095
Vicki Crane.
Right this way.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.876
Mr. Kendall.

30:49.314 --> 30:51.814
I'm glad you changed your mind.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.150
You didn't pull the alarm.

32:23.308 --> 32:26.243
I wouldn't have
pulled it either.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.578
We need to know
who and what is on the disk.

32:40.024 --> 32:42.822
How's your shoulder?

32:44.262 --> 32:45.829
The disk.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.831
Petr Fordson.

32:47.832 --> 32:48.999
Who?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.767
Petr Fordson.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.202
He has a file on the disk.

32:52.203 --> 32:54.703
He's the man
SD-6 will go after first.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.708
Why?

33:00.278 --> 33:02.179
One step at a time.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.047
I need to know why.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.548
No, you want to know why.
There's a difference.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.952
Go after Fordson.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.453
Trust me.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.890
Why should I do that?

33:16.894 --> 33:19.394
Because I'm your mother.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.757
Here's what we know
about Fordson.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.191
He's based in Helsinki.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.427
His company
contracted with the Pentagon

33:50.428 --> 33:52.696
to manufacture
a terahertz wave camera.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.131
Put in a satellite,

33:54.132 --> 33:56.366
they can see
into NORAD undetected.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.001
Last month,
Fordson failed to make delivery,

33:58.002 --> 33:59.770
complaining
of production problems.

33:59.771 --> 34:00.937
Or produced the camera,

34:00.938 --> 34:03.106
but planned on delivering it
to your mother.

34:03.107 --> 34:06.440
So SD-6 wanted that disk
so they could blackmail Fordson

34:06.511 --> 34:07.978
into giving them the camera.

34:07.979 --> 34:11.176
Phillips, get the floor plans
for the Lasgrove Building.

34:11.248 --> 34:14.150
Crane, I want a meeting
on op tech in one hour.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.449
You're going to Helsinki.
You're gonna get that camera.

34:21.259 --> 34:23.920
He's got great
bedside manner, huh?

34:32.937 --> 34:36.134
The guards will be
changing shifts in two minutes.

34:36.206 --> 34:38.175
You should be in the lab
by the time they leave

34:38.176 --> 34:40.676
and have five minutes
before they get back.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.851
# How could I forget #

34:47.851 --> 34:49.686
# The wonderful things #

34:49.687 --> 34:52.713
# That keep me amused? #

34:52.790 --> 34:55.657
# How could I forget #

34:55.726 --> 34:59.662
# To worship you each day? #

35:01.299 --> 35:05.235
# I remember somewhere
in my soul #

35:05.303 --> 35:07.104
Syd...

35:07.105 --> 35:09.605
Sloane's here.

35:10.341 --> 35:12.008
He's after the camera, too.

35:12.009 --> 35:14.211
Do you want to call off the op?

35:14.212 --> 35:16.712
No, we go for it.

35:17.648 --> 35:20.947
- Are you sure?
- I just need a minute.

35:21.018 --> 35:23.748
Mr. Fordson.

35:23.821 --> 35:24.621
Arvin Sloane.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.182
You Americans are persistent.

35:27.258 --> 35:29.059
I'm telling you on the phone,

35:29.060 --> 35:31.428
our company's not looking
for new partners.

35:31.429 --> 35:33.663
Still you come all this way.

35:33.664 --> 35:36.531
Syd, you ready?
- The hand brake won't lock.

35:36.601 --> 35:40.002
Why don't we talk
about it on the balcony?

35:40.071 --> 35:42.439
Shall we?

35:42.440 --> 35:44.674
Syd, he is headed
right towards you.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.009
I'm not ready yet.

35:46.010 --> 35:48.510
You better get ready.

35:52.016 --> 35:54.516
Syd, he's gonna see you.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.331
I'm good. Thanks.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.975
I'm at 14.

36:20.545 --> 36:21.945
Where's Sloane?

36:21.946 --> 36:24.540
With Fordson,
putting on the squeeze.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.318
This is your proposal?

36:28.319 --> 36:29.719
No.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.917
My proposal is
that we go downstairs,

36:32.990 --> 36:36.084
and you give me
your T-wave camera,

36:36.160 --> 36:40.153
and that I keep your daughter's
depravations our secret.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.731
Derevko's gone.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.501
You work for me now.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.002
Let's not waste time.

37:27.345 --> 37:30.576
Sloane just left.
I repeat, he is on his way.

38:02.813 --> 38:05.313
Found it.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.984
Syd, only four more floors
to go.

38:09.987 --> 38:12.487
Got it.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.290
Meet me
at the extraction point.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.804
Let's go.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.045
This is where it was.

39:09.046 --> 39:11.081
I'm telling you.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.574
Well, if it's not here,
it's somewhere.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.119
I don't know.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.620
I swear to God.
I don't know!

39:23.994 --> 39:26.494
Just think about it.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.300
Where could it be?

39:39.510 --> 39:41.678
# 'Twas in another lifetime #

39:41.679 --> 39:43.880
# One of toil and blood #

39:43.881 --> 39:45.749
# When blackness was a virtue #

39:45.750 --> 39:48.250
# And the road
was full of mud #

39:48.285 --> 39:50.653
# I came in
from the wilderness #

39:50.654 --> 39:52.856
# A creature void of form #

39:52.857 --> 39:55.357
# "Come in, " she said #

39:55.960 --> 39:58.361
We're on the same side.

39:58.362 --> 40:00.862
It's time you start
acting like it.

40:06.036 --> 40:08.171
Agent Bristow, hi.

40:08.172 --> 40:11.266
We had a briefing with Derevko
about T-wave technology.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.042
What she knows
about how it works.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.543
Two hours, and your mother
didn't say a single word.

40:15.613 --> 40:19.481
- It's Vicki, right?
- Yeah, with an "I." At the end.

40:19.550 --> 40:23.384
Vicki, I'm tired,
and I want to go home.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.655
I don't mean to be rude,
but if there's nothing else.

40:25.656 --> 40:28.156
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
There isn't, no.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.788
Except the one thing she did ask
was if someone

40:31.862 --> 40:35.263
would pass along
her congratulations to you.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.200
She seemed really proud.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.500
I hope you get some rest.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.205
# "Come in, " she said #

40:42.206 --> 40:45.835
# "I'll give you
shelter from the storm" #

40:54.518 --> 40:57.146
# I was burned out
from exhaustion #

40:57.221 --> 40:58.521
# Buried in the hail #

40:58.522 --> 41:00.123
I want to see the prisoner.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.582
# Poisoned in the bushes
and blown out on the trail #

41:03.661 --> 41:05.695
# Hunted like a crocodile #

41:05.696 --> 41:07.530
# Ravaged in the corn #

41:07.531 --> 41:09.032
# "Come in, " she said #

41:09.033 --> 41:13.026
# "I'll give you
shelter from the storm" #

41:20.578 --> 41:24.639
# Suddenly I turned around,
and she was standing there #

41:24.715 --> 41:27.775
Let's get something clear.

41:27.852 --> 41:30.352
You are not my mother.

41:31.355 --> 41:34.654
My mother was Laura Bristow.

41:34.725 --> 41:37.250
Laura Bristow
died in a car accident

41:37.328 --> 41:38.962
21 years ago.

41:38.963 --> 41:40.263
You are a traitor

41:40.264 --> 41:42.789
and a prisoner
of the United States government.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.603
Look at me.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.338
# Now there's a wall
between us #

41:48.339 --> 41:51.172
# Something that's been lost #

41:51.242 --> 41:54.803
We will interact
only when necessary.

41:54.879 --> 41:56.479
You will address me
as Agent Bristow

41:56.480 --> 41:58.448
and answer
only the questions I ask.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.974
There will be
no personal anecdotes,

42:01.051 --> 42:03.086
no comments
about my job performance,

42:03.087 --> 42:07.456
no condolences
or congratulations.

42:09.426 --> 42:11.060
Do you understand me?

42:11.061 --> 42:13.723
# Well, the deputy
walks on hard nails #

42:13.797 --> 42:16.099
# And the preacher
rides a mount #

42:16.100 --> 42:17.934
# But nothing
really matters much #

42:17.935 --> 42:20.631
Do you understand?

42:21.939 --> 42:24.439
Yes.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.043
Agent Bristow.

42:37.054 --> 42:41.582
# I've heard newborn babies
wailin' like a mournin' dove #

42:41.659 --> 42:43.693
# And old men
with broken teeth #

42:43.694 --> 42:45.695
# Stranded without love #

42:45.696 --> 42:47.864
# Do I understand
your question, man? #

42:47.865 --> 42:49.999
# Is it hopeless and forlorn? #

42:50.000 --> 42:51.467
# "Come in, " she said #

42:51.468 --> 42:55.131
# "I'll give you
shelter from the storm" #

42:56.305 --> 43:02.291
