38:46.440 --> 38:48.113
(GRUNTING)

38:52.440 --> 38:54.750
(CRIES OUT)

38:55.480 --> 38:56.595
(GROANS)

38:58.720 --> 39:00.199
We need to fall back.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.351
-There's too many of them.
-Give the order.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.475
(PAINED GRUNTS)

39:03.560 --> 39:05.119
It's time for a trip.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.999
Pilgrim will come for me.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.356
(PAINED GRUNTS) And when he does,
you won't live another day.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.192
You haven't said a word since we left.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.877
| know that look.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.917
I've seen it before.
| know what it means.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.399
What do you want me to say?

39:29.480 --> 39:31.551
The person who I trusted
the most in the world

39:31.680 --> 39:35.355
used me to usher in a new era
of blood and chaos?

39:35.440 --> 39:37.192
(LAUGHS AND WHEEZES)

39:39.160 --> 39:40.639
You want my advice?

39:40.720 --> 39:43.872
-Do I have a choice?
-(SIGHS) Just stop a second.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.671
Take everything she told you
with a pinch of salt.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.273
Don't trust a word she says.

39:49.360 --> 39:53.319
| spent an entire life
chasing after her dream,

39:53.400 --> 39:54.879
and I do not want you to do the same.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.793
| don't care about my life.
| care about Henry's.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.554
You think this is crazy,
don't you, chasing this Pilgrim?

40:00.640 --> 40:03.314
| think you're doing
a lot of the work for her.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.870
She doesn't give a damn
about you or that baby.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.078
If Pilgrim is the person
| have to face to save Henry,

40:10.160 --> 40:13.152
-then so be it.
-And that's why I'm going with you.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.071
You don't owe me anything, Bajie.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.673
| was there at the beginning.

40:18.760 --> 40:22.754
| set this signal off
and I wanna be there when it ends.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.956
What do you say, old friend?
Trip to Black Wind? (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

40:34.240 --> 40:35.150
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:37.600 --> 40:38.920
(GRUNTS)

41:02.320 --> 41:03.640
What is it?

41:03.720 --> 41:05.677
These lines are...

41:05.760 --> 41:07.876
Are all the Eye will reveal.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.399
These aren't just lines.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.435
They're tattoos.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.555
Every Clipper in the Badlands gets them.

41:20.640 --> 41:22.358
Each line represents
a person they've killed.

41:22.440 --> 41:26.559
The man who bears these marks
is the Catalyst.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.476
He is journeying to us.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.440
Do you recognize the pattern?

41:38.520 --> 41:40.477
They belong to the man
who murdered my mother.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.877
I'm going to kill him.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.633
No, I forbid it!

41:49.720 --> 41:53.600
This man's destiny
is intertwined with mine.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.718
He must suffer no harm

41:56.800 --> 41:59.440
and be welcomed like a brother.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.195
He'll betray you,
the same way he betrayed me.

42:03.280 --> 42:07.558
CRESSIDA: Be he enemy or friend.
This I know,

42:07.640 --> 42:10.758
he will be joining us very soon.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.078
