<i>Every architect can point to that one
design that changed their career.</i>

00:05.231 --> 00:08.103
<i>For me, it was around the time
of my 31st birthday.</i>

00:08.229 --> 00:12.240
It wasn't a museum or a concert hall
or a skyscraper.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.096
<i>It was something else.</i>

00:14.265 --> 00:17.821
We're opening a restaurant called
Rib Town, and we want it to be shaped...

00:18.552 --> 00:19.956
Like a cowboy hat.

00:22.346 --> 00:24.681
Look, I need the work.
I don't have any other options.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.856
- There's always that teaching job.
- Yeah,

00:27.025 --> 00:30.488
I didn't work this hard to be stuck
in some crappy, dead-end teaching job.

00:30.613 --> 00:33.637
- No offense, Lily.
- I got peed on three times today.

00:33.763 --> 00:35.141
No arguments here.

00:35.309 --> 00:38.646
I just gotta nail this hat building so,
I'll see you all in three days.

00:40.062 --> 00:43.592
<i>For the next three days, I worked harder
than I'd ever worked in my life.</i>

00:44.973 --> 00:47.900
<i>And I got... nowhere.</i>

00:51.792 --> 00:53.433
Hey, Ted, whatcha doing?

00:53.558 --> 00:55.599
Designing a building shaped
like a hat.

00:55.915 --> 00:57.731
- Now a good time to chat?
- No.

00:57.900 --> 01:01.676
- So, what do you think of Robin?
- I really need to get to work, so...

01:02.377 --> 01:04.934
Great.
Say you and I went suit-shopping,

01:05.251 --> 01:08.009
and you happened upon
a beautiful suit,

01:08.135 --> 01:10.240
a beautiful Canadian suit.

01:11.455 --> 01:12.759
Double-breasted.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.348
You try it on, but it's not exactly
the right fit for you.

01:17.473 --> 01:19.905
So, you put it back.
Then I try it on.

01:20.806 --> 01:22.260
I don't really want

01:22.501 --> 01:25.886
to take the same suit that you had
your eye on, but at the same time,

01:26.012 --> 01:28.293
I really like that suit.

01:29.862 --> 01:32.821
Buy the suit, Barney.
You clearly care about it.

01:33.205 --> 01:34.631
Tell the suit how you feel.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.906
But Ted, rember that
that was your answer because...

01:44.798 --> 01:46.203
The suit is Robin.

01:46.881 --> 01:47.882
I know!

01:48.995 --> 01:49.997
Right?

01:50.883 --> 01:52.244
I'm with you, buddy.

01:52.627 --> 01:53.624
You are now.

01:54.549 --> 01:57.431
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

02:12.360 --> 02:15.534
Come on, dude, you've been at this
for three days without a break.

02:15.659 --> 02:18.091
It's your birthday. Come up to the roof
and have a beer with me.

02:18.216 --> 02:19.980
No can do.
Presentation is tomorrow.

02:20.105 --> 02:21.821
Hat buildings
don't design themselves.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.369
It's a rib joint for fat tourists.

02:24.495 --> 02:26.934
Just make sure the doors are wide
and the chairs are reinforced.

02:27.059 --> 02:29.937
Now, birthday beer on the roof.
Let's go!

02:30.106 --> 02:32.127
Why do you want me to come up
to the roof so bad?

02:32.252 --> 02:34.911
Are you throwing me a surprise party?
- What?

02:35.773 --> 02:38.273
Ted, we threw you
a surprise party last year.

02:38.398 --> 02:40.814
Okay, you don't get
two surprise parties in a row.

02:41.297 --> 02:44.043
The fact that anyone showed up
at the first one was surprise enough.

02:44.168 --> 02:46.755
{\pos(192,220)}Right?
Two surprise parties in a row!

02:46.924 --> 02:48.223
That is rich!

02:48.348 --> 02:50.499
That is rich!

02:51.861 --> 02:52.755
Classic!

02:52.957 --> 02:55.489
Classic...
He still won't come up.

02:56.883 --> 02:58.469
Come on. What the crap?!

02:58.638 --> 03:01.231
 knew having a second surprise party
was a bad idea.

03:01.483 --> 03:04.117
Yes, Robin, I know.
This party is...

03:04.424 --> 03:06.390
it's... it's a disaster.

03:06.712 --> 03:09.633
It was my idea.
I take responsibility.

03:11.682 --> 03:13.949
And there's really only one thing
to do about it.

03:19.188 --> 03:22.316
- Marshall, no.
- Lily, I have to do this!

03:22.694 --> 03:24.491
No point in putting it off
any longer.

03:25.099 --> 03:27.964
<i>I should explain.
You see, a few years earlier...</i>

03:31.748 --> 03:33.863
Forget it.
This is so not pimped out.

03:34.624 --> 03:36.924
If anything, this is pimped in.

03:38.238 --> 03:41.047
You know who knows how to live?
Those people.

03:42.170 --> 03:44.237
<i>The rooftop patio
one building over from ours.</i>

03:45.452 --> 03:49.203
<i>Across a chasm of just six or seven feet
awaited a landscaped paradise.</i>

03:49.328 --> 03:50.476
<i>And best of all...</i>

03:50.602 --> 03:52.331
That looks to be one...

03:52.999 --> 03:54.027
... hot...

03:54.927 --> 03:55.784
tub.

03:56.173 --> 03:57.737
Great. How do we get over there?

03:57.863 --> 04:00.302
What are we gonna do? Jump?

04:10.020 --> 04:11.526
I can jump that far.

04:13.501 --> 04:16.435
{\pos(192,180)}Marshall, lately it takes you
two tries to get off the sofa.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.267
You can't jump that far.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.471
- Really?
- Really.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.172
Watch me.

04:31.015 --> 04:32.469
<i>But he didn't jump.</i>

04:34.582 --> 04:36.056
This actually is kind of nice.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.898
Right? Right?

04:41.566 --> 04:44.876
<i>And in the years that followed,
he kept almost jumping.</i>

04:51.905 --> 04:53.756
<i>But each time, without fail...</i>

04:55.992 --> 04:56.862
Here we go.

04:56.987 --> 04:58.287
<i>He didn't jump.</i>

04:58.736 --> 05:01.844
But don't worry.
'Cause if I can make this jump tonight,

05:02.610 --> 05:04.479
it's totally gonna save the party.

05:04.725 --> 05:06.863
Honey, please get down from there.

05:08.154 --> 05:11.303
When Evel Knievel sat astride
his star-spangled rocket

05:11.429 --> 05:13.474
on the rim of Snake River Canyon,

05:13.599 --> 05:16.653
do you think his wife said,
"Honey, get down from there"?

05:16.935 --> 05:20.110
For the last time,
I am not Linda Knievel!

05:20.235 --> 05:22.803
I will never be Linda Knievel!

05:24.274 --> 05:25.606
You don't need to remind me.

05:35.974 --> 05:38.846
Marshall, please don't do this.
Please don't jump.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.002
I'm sorry, Lily,
but I gotta do this.

05:41.126 --> 05:42.883
- You can't do this.
- Why?

05:43.788 --> 05:45.192
You want a reason?

05:45.646 --> 05:47.301
I'll give you a reason.

05:47.427 --> 05:48.879
I'm pregnant.

05:49.809 --> 05:50.916
Oh, my God!

05:51.166 --> 05:53.009
Oh, my God, really?!

05:53.418 --> 05:56.397
Lily, I mean, I noticed
that you gained some weight lately...

05:57.208 --> 05:59.284
I was lying, you jerk!

06:00.414 --> 06:02.630
Go ahead and jump.
I hope you die!

06:06.159 --> 06:08.315
That's all the permission I need.

06:13.403 --> 06:14.762
Listen, Robin...

06:19.582 --> 06:21.799
- There's something I have to tell you.
- But wait.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.511
Before you do,
I have to tell you something first.

06:26.367 --> 06:27.500
What is it?

06:28.412 --> 06:30.368
I think I'm in love with you.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.306
It's Ted.
Everybody!

06:44.977 --> 06:48.147
- Hey, Ted, what's up?
- It's here, Lily.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.339
It's looking at me.

06:52.284 --> 06:54.632
- What is?
- The goat.

06:55.230 --> 06:57.854
<i>Now, I've told you some of the story
of the goat already.</i>

06:58.349 --> 07:01.446
<i>How Aunt Lily invited a local farmer
to come talk to her class,</i>

07:01.572 --> 07:02.953
<i>and how he brought a goat,</i>

07:03.078 --> 07:05.117
<i>and how he told the whole class
what he was gonna do</i>

07:05.241 --> 07:06.873
<i>to the goat later that day.</i>

07:07.027 --> 07:08.982
<i>And how Aunt Lily,
in a fit of mercy,</i>

07:09.445 --> 07:12.245
<i>bought the goat off the guy
in order to commute its sentence.</i>

07:12.663 --> 07:14.588
Something amazing has happened.

07:14.757 --> 07:17.820
I was talking to Robin,
I was all set to tell her how I feel,

07:17.945 --> 07:20.738
but before I could,
you'll never believe what she said.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.536
I think I'm in love with you.

07:23.346 --> 07:25.256
- What did you say?!
- What do you think I said?

07:25.423 --> 07:27.390
What would anyone say
to something like that?

07:30.232 --> 07:31.701
Robin, listen.

07:32.894 --> 07:33.833
You're great.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.773
I mean, you're really awesome,
but I mean, we're friends.

07:38.193 --> 07:39.648
It's probably a bad idea.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.738
I guess you're right.

07:44.232 --> 07:45.547
Have a good party.

07:45.793 --> 07:47.047
You too, kiddo.

07:49.364 --> 07:51.873
- What?!
- It's like, as soon as she said that,

07:51.998 --> 07:54.290
no more feelings.
I'm not in love with her anymore.

07:54.885 --> 07:57.873
So, you've been in love with this girl
for the past year,

07:57.999 --> 08:00.878
and the second
she reciprocates those feelings,

08:01.003 --> 08:02.615
just like that, you're over her.

08:02.955 --> 08:04.581
How great is that?!

08:12.373 --> 08:13.702
This is a washcloth.

08:14.091 --> 08:15.094
Not food.

08:32.928 --> 08:34.116
What the...?

08:36.803 --> 08:37.856
This is it.

08:39.313 --> 08:40.317
Here...

08:40.660 --> 08:42.342
we... go!

08:44.668 --> 08:45.497
This is it.

08:46.467 --> 08:48.677
Tracey, Tracey,
tell Lily what you just told me.

08:49.471 --> 08:52.521
- That I just moved to New York?
- No, no, but tell her how you got here.

08:52.646 --> 08:54.498
I just got off the bus from Iowa.

08:54.623 --> 08:57.748
I just got off the bus from Iowa!

08:58.528 --> 09:01.609
How lucky is it that an aspiring

09:01.735 --> 09:02.737
dancer

09:03.048 --> 09:06.069
just off the bus from Iowa runs into

09:06.195 --> 09:08.248
the producer of the Rockettes?

09:09.088 --> 09:11.853
I feel like I'm in one of those
classic show biz stories.

09:12.299 --> 09:14.950
Honey, you are.
You really are.

09:15.939 --> 09:18.108
Tracey, why don't you make me
one of those rum and beers

09:18.234 --> 09:20.136
- that your dad loves so much?
- Sure thing!

09:22.842 --> 09:24.697
- Damn it.
- What?

09:26.064 --> 09:28.332
Everybody always says,
"Don't tell Lily."

09:28.457 --> 09:31.323
"Lily can't keep a secret."
And, usually, they're right.

09:31.448 --> 09:33.567
But this time, I kept the secret.

09:34.251 --> 09:36.307
And then you come along
with this crap

09:36.433 --> 09:40.442
and you force me to pull
an old classic Lily and spill the beans!

09:41.225 --> 09:43.104
What beans?
There's beans?

09:44.139 --> 09:45.406
There's beans.

09:45.858 --> 09:47.414
The suit is Robin.

09:47.967 --> 09:48.970
I know!

09:50.093 --> 09:51.095
Right?

09:52.005 --> 09:53.354
I'm with you, buddy.

09:53.763 --> 09:54.734
You are now.

09:55.705 --> 09:58.208
- Because I explained it to you.
- What do you talk...

10:00.099 --> 10:01.280
There you go.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.750
Crap.

10:08.919 --> 10:11.329
- He said that?
- Oh, my God!

10:11.454 --> 10:14.272
What a tremendous
ground-breaking surprise!

10:14.441 --> 10:16.062
- How long have you known?
- 8 months.

10:16.187 --> 10:18.791
And you've kept it a secret since then?
Good for you.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.612
Good for you, Lily.

10:21.738 --> 10:24.271
I mean, what a bombshell.
Who saw that coming?

10:24.440 --> 10:26.685
- How long have you known?
- Seven months, 29 days.

10:27.371 --> 10:28.746
God, what am I going to do?

10:28.916 --> 10:29.914
I don't know.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.634
What are you going to do?

10:32.273 --> 10:34.521
I'm going to marry Barney
in a big church wedding.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.075
We're going to move
to some sleepy New Hampshire town

10:37.200 --> 10:38.537
and open a bed-and-breakfast.

10:39.926 --> 10:41.301
- Really?
- No!

10:41.969 --> 10:42.972
It's Barney.

10:43.185 --> 10:44.187
I mean...

10:44.906 --> 10:46.021
it's Barney.

10:46.876 --> 10:48.317
But it's Barney.

10:49.018 --> 10:50.125
I got to tell him no.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.029
Oh, man, you're going
to break his...

10:53.720 --> 10:57.238
Whatever it is that pumps
that black sludge through his veins.

10:57.733 --> 10:58.953
Crap. You're right.

10:59.236 --> 11:01.641
The first time Barney
expresses feelings for a girl

11:01.766 --> 11:03.187
and she rejects him?

11:03.810 --> 11:05.768
And not just any girl. I mean...

11:07.174 --> 11:08.548
It will destroy him.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.942
Okay, well, first of all...

11:16.693 --> 11:18.864
Second of all,
there is a maneuver you can try.

11:18.990 --> 11:21.121
It's high-risk,
but it's also high-reward.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.807
For lack of a better term,
I'm going to call it...

11:25.158 --> 11:27.067
- The Mosby.
- The Mosby?

11:27.237 --> 11:29.131
No, she couldn't Mosby him.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.422
- She could Mosby the crap out of him.
- What's the Mosby?

11:32.661 --> 11:34.668
Robin, you remember
your first date with Ted?

11:34.793 --> 11:37.917
You wanted to hop on the T-train
and take a ride downtown.

11:38.043 --> 11:39.701
I was ready to jump that turnstile.

11:41.077 --> 11:42.504
What changed all that?

11:43.694 --> 11:45.264
I think I'm in love with you.

11:45.435 --> 11:46.185
What?

11:47.972 --> 11:49.113
The Mosby!

11:49.762 --> 11:51.938
- That is genius.
- Thank you.

11:52.063 --> 11:52.796
And...

11:53.525 --> 11:54.529
excuse me.

11:57.112 --> 11:59.222
I mean, you're very pretty,
but you're freakishly tall,

11:59.347 --> 12:00.899
and you don't believe in ghosts.

12:02.632 --> 12:05.328
So, when she said she thinks
she's in love with me,

12:05.454 --> 12:07.563
she meant the opposite.

12:07.733 --> 12:08.652
Exactly.

12:08.778 --> 12:10.910
And look how well it worked.
You're back to normal.

12:11.159 --> 12:12.751
Yes. Yes, I am.

12:13.353 --> 12:15.615
And it is great.
It's awesome.

12:17.439 --> 12:19.877
- So, Robin's not in love with me.
- Nope.

12:21.664 --> 12:22.835
Why not?

12:26.174 --> 12:27.268
Mr. Goat?

12:43.022 --> 12:43.835
Mr. Goat?

12:47.417 --> 12:48.421
That's it.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.412
Stupid goat.

12:53.828 --> 12:56.888
I do not understand your
fascination with this washcloth.

12:57.056 --> 12:59.691
I guess that's what happens
when you have a brain the size of a...

13:07.859 --> 13:09.732
Marshall, can you just go get Ted?

13:09.901 --> 13:13.238
Lily, I was just about to jump.

13:13.364 --> 13:16.185
Didn't you hear me saying "Okay"
over and over again?

13:16.386 --> 13:18.224
Oh, I'm sorry.
Go ahead and jump.

13:18.393 --> 13:19.334
No, it's fine.

13:19.572 --> 13:20.926
Sorry, everybody.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.233
Lily won't let me jump.

13:29.594 --> 13:30.670
Thank God.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.069
Hospital!

13:44.246 --> 13:45.643
What happened exactly?

13:46.912 --> 13:50.297
What happened is
you let a freaking wild animal

13:50.422 --> 13:51.877
into our apartment.

13:52.429 --> 13:53.633
I was savaged.

13:53.994 --> 13:57.885
That is the sweetest, cutest
little goat in the whole world.

13:58.135 --> 14:01.516
Sweetest, cutest little goat
in the whole world?

14:01.915 --> 14:03.656
<i>I was pretty sleep-deprived
at this point,</i>

14:03.780 --> 14:05.648
<i>so this probably isn't
how it really happened,</i>

14:05.773 --> 14:07.088
<i>but here's how I rember it.</i>

14:25.997 --> 14:28.215
So, you're the guy who tried
to make it with a goat?

14:30.098 --> 14:32.482
If anything, that goat
tried to make it with me.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.370
- Can I go, please?
- Sure, you can go.

14:35.539 --> 14:38.424
But remember, buddy,
"baa" means "baa."

14:42.034 --> 14:44.614
Great. Great. Now I'm going to be late
for my presentation.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.874
Thanks a lot, Mr. Goat.

14:47.044 --> 14:49.426
Mr. Goat? Ted, that goat's a girl.

14:49.926 --> 14:52.441
- Her name's Missy.
- You got beat up by a girl.

15:00.541 --> 15:01.433
So.

15:01.603 --> 15:05.030
- You're in love with me.
- What? Yeah. Very much.

15:05.919 --> 15:08.303
Okay, you can knock it off.
Lily told me.

15:08.506 --> 15:09.382
Damn it.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.683
I can't believe you would do that.

15:12.492 --> 15:13.596
It's just...

15:13.756 --> 15:15.364
Like, I care about you, Barney.

15:15.575 --> 15:16.410
And...

15:16.578 --> 15:18.988
This kind of stuff,
the emotional stuff?

15:19.589 --> 15:22.267
It's not your thing.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.

15:22.613 --> 15:24.400
Maybe I don't want
to be saved the trouble.

15:25.043 --> 15:26.284
Maybe I want the trouble.

15:27.541 --> 15:29.562
I haven't wanted the trouble
in a long time.

15:29.687 --> 15:32.228
But with you, the trouble
doesn't seem so...

15:33.071 --> 15:34.074
troubling.

15:35.642 --> 15:37.035
I don't know.
I thought...

15:38.078 --> 15:40.047
I guess I thought
you felt the same way.

15:41.554 --> 15:42.599
Maybe I do.

15:44.372 --> 15:45.526
I don't know.

15:45.692 --> 15:48.484
I'm not exactly the biggest
confronter of feelings.

15:49.705 --> 15:52.589
I mean, clearly, there's
something between us.

15:53.279 --> 15:55.886
Maybe my head was saying,
"Nip it in the bud"

15:56.011 --> 15:57.613
because my heart was...

15:58.125 --> 15:59.639
saying something else.

16:01.618 --> 16:02.456
Look...

16:03.184 --> 16:04.856
I have feelings for you, Barney.

16:06.508 --> 16:07.910
Maybe I even love you.

16:08.929 --> 16:10.839
This is going pretty fast,
don't you think?

16:11.007 --> 16:13.720
- What?
- We have a{\ really} good friendship going.

16:13.845 --> 16:15.105
Why screw up a good thing?

16:15.779 --> 16:16.529
Friends?

16:18.172 --> 16:19.174
Friends.

16:20.491 --> 16:22.843
My God. You just did it again.
You just Mosby'd me.

16:23.013 --> 16:25.313
- I did not.
- You did. You little minx.

16:25.482 --> 16:27.405
Okay, you're right.
I did just Mosby you.

16:27.573 --> 16:29.581
Why are you so afraid
of giving this a chance?

16:29.749 --> 16:32.509
Because I am scared
of how much I like you.

16:32.719 --> 16:34.015
This is a bad idea.

16:34.184 --> 16:36.107
You're right.
This is a mistake.

16:36.276 --> 16:37.496
- Yes. No.
- I love you.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.370
- Let's be friends.
- Friends, then.

16:39.538 --> 16:41.045
- I love you.
- Let's get married.

16:41.170 --> 16:43.218
- No, you're smothering me.
- Okay, forget it.

16:49.036 --> 16:51.042
You know what?
We can sort this out later.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.442
- That sounds good.
- That sounds good. Let's go.

16:54.917 --> 16:56.987
<i>It had been a long and crazy night,</i>

16:57.112 --> 16:59.242
<i>but that morning, against all odds,</i>

16:59.411 --> 17:00.875
<i>I made it to my presentation.</i>

17:01.000 --> 17:02.817
Here you have it, gentlemen.

17:02.943 --> 17:03.945
Rib Town.

17:04.557 --> 17:05.559
Right?

17:06.247 --> 17:07.250
Right?

17:10.090 --> 17:12.042
Ted, listen. You're great,

17:12.286 --> 17:14.042
and you've done a real...

17:14.355 --> 17:15.862
special job here,

17:15.988 --> 17:18.080
and you're going to make
some other restaurant

17:18.205 --> 17:19.406
very happy someday,

17:19.751 --> 17:20.579
but...

17:20.749 --> 17:21.703
we have...

17:21.948 --> 17:23.164
decided to go...

17:23.512 --> 17:25.165
another direction here.

17:25.559 --> 17:26.583
What?

17:26.709 --> 17:28.474
Feast your eyes on...

17:29.840 --> 17:30.744
Rib Town!

17:34.359 --> 17:35.548
Sven.

17:38.874 --> 17:41.747
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm never eating ribs again.

17:42.384 --> 17:43.462
Yeah, right.

17:44.013 --> 17:45.168
I am never...

17:45.834 --> 17:47.038
eating ribs...

17:47.339 --> 17:48.341
again!

17:49.994 --> 17:51.313
In front of Ted!

17:52.208 --> 17:53.419
This is a disaster.

17:54.592 --> 17:56.357
How am I going
to come back from this?

17:57.121 --> 17:59.001
Okay, I'm just going to ask this.

17:59.127 --> 18:00.992
Do you really want
to come back from this?

18:01.510 --> 18:04.581
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Architecture is killing you, Ted,

18:05.030 --> 18:07.100
and it's killing us to watch it
killing you.

18:08.095 --> 18:10.285
You're like that goat
with the washcloth.

18:10.410 --> 18:12.185
You want it so bad,

18:12.310 --> 18:14.595
and every time the world tries
to take it away from you,

18:14.721 --> 18:16.052
you keep grabbing it.

18:16.430 --> 18:17.600
But you know what?

18:17.770 --> 18:20.445
It's just a washcloth.
Why do you even want it?

18:20.937 --> 18:23.456
Because I have to be an architect.

18:23.581 --> 18:24.504
That's...

18:25.212 --> 18:26.553
That's the plan.

18:26.722 --> 18:29.817
Screw the plan.
I planned on being a famous artist.

18:30.042 --> 18:32.612
Marshall planned on being
an environmental lawyer.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.214
Robin planned on
being a TV reporter.

18:36.514 --> 18:38.132
I am a TV reporter.

18:38.258 --> 18:39.981
I'm on every morning at 4:00 a.m.

18:40.151 --> 18:41.401
Is that still on?

18:41.745 --> 18:42.911
Good for you.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.724
Somebody watch it, please.

18:45.422 --> 18:47.303
Barney planned on being a violinist.

18:48.441 --> 18:49.647
Don't tell me things.

18:51.376 --> 18:53.888
You can't design your life
like a building.

18:54.013 --> 18:55.899
It doesn't work that way.

18:56.452 --> 18:58.934
You just have to live it,
and it will design itself.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.194
So, what, I should just do nothing?

19:02.287 --> 19:04.964
Listen to what the world
is telling you to do

19:05.089 --> 19:06.297
and take the leap.

19:14.515 --> 19:15.668
You're right.

19:16.336 --> 19:17.895
You're absolutely right.

19:19.502 --> 19:20.952
I love you, Lily.

19:22.701 --> 19:24.202
Metaphorical leap.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.148
Metaphorical leap!

19:26.882 --> 19:28.179
- Not cool.
- Don't do it.

19:28.304 --> 19:29.181
Not cool.

19:38.204 --> 19:40.603
- I did it!
- Baby, you did it.

19:40.791 --> 19:43.195
- I can do anything!
- Yes, you can.

19:43.366 --> 19:44.828
I'm getting a motorcycle!

19:44.997 --> 19:46.418
You absolutely are not!

19:46.587 --> 19:48.510
Okay, sorry.
Guys, come on over.

20:25.697 --> 20:27.458
<i>That was the year
I got left at the altar.</i>

20:28.634 --> 20:31.398
<i>It was the year I got knocked out
by a crazy bartender.</i>

20:31.894 --> 20:33.315
<i>The year I got fired.</i>

20:34.275 --> 20:36.161
<i>The year I got beat up by a goat.</i>

20:36.533 --> 20:38.087
<i>A girl goat, at that.</i>

20:38.852 --> 20:41.055
<i>And damn it if it wasn't
the best year of my life.</i>

20:46.462 --> 20:48.750
<i>Because, if any one of those things
hadn't happened,</i>

20:49.548 --> 20:52.583
<i>I never would have ended up and turned
out to be the best job I ever had.</i>

20:53.816 --> 20:55.318
<i>But more importantly,</i>

20:55.444 --> 20:57.391
<i>I wouldn't have met your mother,</i>

20:58.227 --> 20:59.882
<i>because, as you know...</i>

21:00.236 --> 21:01.840
<i>she was in that class.</i>

21:03.120 --> 21:05.726
<i>Of course, that story
is only just beginning.</i>
