04:10.040 --> 04:11.519
Hey, what the hell.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.716
Ooh!

05:18.120 --> 05:21.669
'Commander Forrester,
Gelson on line four, sir.'

05:22.680 --> 05:24.033
Forrester.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.793
- Listen, we've got another one.
- Are you sure?

05:26.880 --> 05:30.031
He trashed an arcade full of video games
without touchin' 'em.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.715
Two officers chased him into
the Ricks Brothers warehouse on 37th.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.394
Keep this off the airwaves. I'm on my way.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.993
'You got it.'

05:56.800 --> 05:59.917
- Yeah.
- 'I think we found another one. Get ready.'

06:00.000 --> 06:01.797
Great.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.398
Shut up.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.074
- Where is he?
- Inside, sir.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.674
- Is he alone?
- Yes, sir.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.069
Block up both ends of the street.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.117
Leave me alone!

07:18.480 --> 07:20.994
What are you looking at?

07:21.080 --> 07:23.640
You're not allowed to look at me.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.836
He's in there.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.155
You hear him?

08:23.640 --> 08:25.949
Hurry. Let's go.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.639
- I brought Feck and Gruner.
- Scanners, are you sure?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.836
Nembutal boosters.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.592
We want him unharmed.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.390
I don't want a scan war up there.

08:38.480 --> 08:41.073
Relax, they're not going to try to scan him.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.116
We'll just use tranquillizers.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.237
Ah!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.996
Morning, Dr. Morse.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.912
Hi, Doc.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.153
Relax, Peter, you're amongst friends.
We understand you.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.357
- Bullshit.
- My name is Dr. Morse.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.034
My specialty is the study of scanners.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.237
- Scanners...
- That's what you are, Peter.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.276
- Scanner, huh?
- Mmm.

11:18.360 --> 11:20.954
They called me worse names
in the nuthouse.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.634
Well, they didn't understand you.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.109
They said you were sick, didn't they?

11:29.200 --> 11:33.990
Hmm? Well, you're not sick.
You're just very special, very talented.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.674
What do you want with me, then?

11:36.760 --> 11:42.118
I promise you one thing, Peter.
I won't send you back to the hospital.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.749
- 'I asked you a question, Doctor.'
- 'I just want to help you.'

11:45.840 --> 11:49.799
Liar, you want to use me like a guinea pig.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.997
Stick wires in my head, control me.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.913
The wires aren't to control. They're to help.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.956
Give him the EPH-2.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.074
Wait!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.956
There was no other way.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.996
Drak was a perfectly potent scanner,

12:25.080 --> 12:28.197
but you're going to turn him into
another EPH-2 junkie.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.353
Now he's had a taste, he'll want more
and within six months he'll deteriorate.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.113
Right now it's the only way
we can control them.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.350
Within a year, he'll be worthless.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.396
Look at this.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.712
You've got them under control, all right,
but they're useless to me.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.870
It's pathetic.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.269
They're just dying drug addicts now.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.916
I think Drak is strong enough.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.471
A combination of EPH-2 and psychotropics,
we can get some miles out of him.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.874
'Now the local scene.
It's a hazy day out there in the metro area,

13:25.960 --> 13:28.269
'with a pollution index of 7.5.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.909
'People with respiratory conditions
are advised to stay indoors.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.356
'Police have no suspects
in the milk murderer tampering case.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.749
'Two children died of strychnine poisoning.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.956
'A third remains in critical condition.'

13:40.040 --> 13:44.636
'And on the sports scene, there are rumors
coming out of New York...'

14:07.040 --> 14:09.634
Mr. Kellum, you're late.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.676
Sorry.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.749
You missed all the fun.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.913
And, as you saw,
there's a metal ring lodged in the stomach.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.468
So let's proceed with the gastrontomy.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.154
Here's the stomach.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.639
Scalpel.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.317
Harris.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.676
Are you all right?

14:51.160 --> 14:53.116
I'm don't feel very well.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.794
What's the matter? Are you squeamish?

15:07.880 --> 15:11.668
No. I've just been getting
these headaches lately.

15:11.760 --> 15:15.036
At least you don't have canine encephalitis.

15:15.120 --> 15:20.148
Look at this puppy. We'll probably put him to
sleep when they're finished experimenting.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.636
There's a good boy.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.989
You're gonna be OK.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.634
Be a good boy and we'll get you out of here.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.273
So I never asked you where you're from.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.316
Bridge Falls, Vermont.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.949
My er... parents have a farm out there.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.918
Only been gone three weeks
and I already miss it.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.673
- Don't you like the city?
- No. What's to like?

16:18.760 --> 16:23.197
So much noise, noise and traffic.
Sometimes you can't even breathe.

16:23.280 --> 16:24.952
- Too many people.
- Hi, Alice.

16:25.040 --> 16:28.316
- Hi, Glen.
- Don't you have any friends in the city?

16:28.400 --> 16:30.709
Not really.

16:30.800 --> 16:36.033
Well, I'll be your friend, David.
Alice... Leonardo, like the artist.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.837
Well, look, I ought to get back to the dorm,
cram for that pathology assignment.

16:43.920 --> 16:48.072
Pathology? On a Friday night?

16:48.160 --> 16:50.674
David, that's pathetic.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.069
I mean, you gotta have some fun.

16:53.160 --> 16:56.835
- At least that's what this doctor orders.
- But you're only a vet.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.151
And not for four years,
but some remedies work across species.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.992
So what species am I?

17:02.080 --> 17:04.513
We can talk about it over dinner.
Italian food.

17:04.599 --> 17:08.387
- Look, I'm behind. I've got to get back.
- You don't have to.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.909
But what have you got to lose?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.718
- Nothing, I guess.
- Great.

17:21.400 --> 17:23.391
Why did you decide to become a vet?

17:23.480 --> 17:25.993
I like animals.
I feel comfortable around them.

17:26.079 --> 17:30.517
- Not like humans, liars and hypocrites.
- You're so right.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.356
There are good sides to humans.

17:40.440 --> 17:42.954
- I thought you were shy.
- Only with humans.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.634
- So what am I?
- I'm not sure yet.

17:46.560 --> 17:49.313
I guess I'll have to buy you a drink.
What do you want?

17:49.400 --> 17:51.152
A draught.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.796
A draught and a Pepsi.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.076
David!

18:30.160 --> 18:32.116
Forget it.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.393
David?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.438
I'm sorry.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.272
I...

18:50.760 --> 18:53.877
I didn't mean to run out of there like that.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.713
Oh, the migraines are just so bad lately.

19:21.200 --> 19:26.593
'Mr. Montoya told us that you were
the price of doing business in this town.'

19:26.680 --> 19:29.194
'You're right. I am the best lawyer in town.'

19:29.280 --> 19:31.475
Not any more, Karman, baby.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.709
So how can I help you?

19:32.800 --> 19:37.430
We've got a pipeline for 50ks a month
straight from Peru.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.513
Now, this is not our turf.
We need introductions.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.750
Uh-huh, I see.

19:43.840 --> 19:49.233
By the way, your introduction, Mr. Montoya,

19:49.320 --> 19:52.437
just happens to have been
cremated two weeks ago.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.512
Who the hell do you think
you're fucking with here?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.709
Show these zombies the stairs.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.997
What's the matter, counselor?

20:23.080 --> 20:26.629
Little nosebleed. Maybe it's the blow.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.509
Your mother's phone number.
That's sweet.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.398
Fire!

21:14.600 --> 21:16.352
Scum.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.194
'Now I'll try and get
a few words from Commander Forrester.'

21:20.280 --> 21:22.396
'This office used to belong

21:22.480 --> 21:26.109
'to the most corrupt lawyer in the city,
Mr. Karman Lucret.

21:26.200 --> 21:32.355
'Like you see here tonight, we'll need
surgeons who will rid society of his kind.

21:32.440 --> 21:36.831
'Lucret put criminals back on the street.
Now he doesn't.'

21:36.920 --> 21:41.357
You know... when my parents
brought me to this country,

21:41.440 --> 21:46.468
they were looking for freedom, for security
and a chance for a better life.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.869
All of this is now in danger.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.030
If we are going to save the society,
we're gonna have to cure crime.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.593
'We'll need new
and more powerful medicines.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.195
'We'll need surgical procedures,
like you see here tonight.

22:02.280 --> 22:07.434
'We need an entire new order in our society,
a coalition of political figures,

22:07.520 --> 22:11.274
law-enforcement officers
and honest citizens.'

22:25.440 --> 22:27.396
Good morning, Louise.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.436
Thanks.

22:36.160 --> 22:40.312
Who do you think you are, talking to
the press without my authorization?

22:40.400 --> 22:43.073
- I apologize.
- Apologize to the Mayor.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.674
There was smoke coming
out of her ears all morning

22:45.760 --> 22:48.593
over that line of yours
about flaccid leadership.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.989
What's this about this new order of yours?

22:51.080 --> 22:52.798
It's just rhetoric, Chief.

22:52.880 --> 22:59.353
The only new order around here is when
I investigate your so-called special unit.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.314
Have a nice day, sir.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.914
- How's everything?
- Not good.

23:22.920 --> 23:27.710
Elaine, one of our female scanners,
just died. We're losing too many too fast.

23:27.800 --> 23:31.759
The only functional scanners
we have left are Feck, Gruner and Drak.

23:31.840 --> 23:34.434
I wouldn't call that functional.

23:34.520 --> 23:38.513
He's got tremendous command of
his powers. He could bounce back.

23:38.600 --> 23:43.993
He's a psychopath.
What we need is a clean scanner.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.433
A virgin mind.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.870
- Who is it?
- It's David.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.437
Hi there. I was just about
to get dinner ready.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.716
Enter.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.436
Kiss?

24:25.480 --> 24:27.630
What's in the blanket?

24:34.480 --> 24:38.029
- Oh, my God.
- He's all right. He's completely cured.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.872
Hi there.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.633
I told you, I have a way with animals.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.314
- He's adorable.
- He's yours.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.830
Really?

24:53.920 --> 24:57.037
He seems to think so.
What are you going to call him?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.076
- Fred?
- Uh-uh.

24:59.960 --> 25:04.033
Trooper... cos he made it. He survived.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.477
So... when's dinner going to be ready?

25:13.320 --> 25:15.629
As soon as I get some pesto sauce.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.198
Thanks. Come again.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.032
Bye.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.873
- Want anything from downstairs?
- No, I'm OK.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.270
And I need some milk and water.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.112
Mm-hm.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.437
Hang on, I need some milk.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.431
- Sorry.
- What?

25:39.520 --> 25:43.069
What kind of sicko would stick
strychnine in kids' milk?

25:44.200 --> 25:46.794
- I hope they catch the bastard.
- Mm-hm.

25:46.880 --> 25:50.031
Everybody freeze. Nobody move.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.998
All you've got now!

25:57.960 --> 26:00.269
Down! You, too, bitch!

26:06.520 --> 26:08.476
Hey!

26:11.880 --> 26:14.348
- Quiet!
- You bastard!

26:14.440 --> 26:17.557
You drop it or I'll decorate
the place with her brains.

26:21.640 --> 26:25.394
- We're out of here, man. We're out of here.
- Let her go.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.038
No!

26:39.960 --> 26:42.679
- What kind of crazy...
- David!

27:52.000 --> 27:53.956
You tell me.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.713
A beautiful, beautiful scanner.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.236
I want him.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.230
Excuse me.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.595
You can see her now,
but just for five minutes.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.956
- She's had a concussion.
- Thanks.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.751
David...

28:31.400 --> 28:33.356
What happened?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.590
It's all right. You're OK.

28:36.640 --> 28:38.790
What about you?

28:39.680 --> 28:41.432
I'm fine.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.876
But in the store...

28:47.360 --> 28:51.114
- What happened to that man?
- I don't know.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.350
Yes, you do.

29:04.240 --> 29:09.268
Ever since I was a little kid,
I've been able to do things.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.749
What kind of things?

29:11.840 --> 29:17.597
Sort of telepathic things, I guess.
I've never really understood it.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.874
It's never been like this. I...

29:29.920 --> 29:33.993
It's getting stronger.
I don't know what's happening to me.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.957
I don't know if I can stop it.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.916
Your time's up.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.156
Hello, David.

30:25.280 --> 30:28.829
My name is Commander Forrester.
I'm with the police.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.876
What do you want?

30:31.960 --> 30:33.791
You killed a man last night.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.189
- I didn't touch him.
- I know you didn't.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.750
That's what makes it so interesting,
don't you think?

30:40.680 --> 30:43.353
Don't worry. You're not in trouble, David.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.754
I came here as a friend, not to arrest you.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.109
What happened last night is between us.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.474
You see, I happen to understand
your problem.

31:01.560 --> 31:05.394
And you may not know it,
but there are others like you.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.356
You're not alone.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.877
OK, we'll just focus this.

31:14.920 --> 31:19.357
Good. Now, what we're doing
is measuring your PSI.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.396
Your psychic energy waves.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.436
Just keep still.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.476
The migraines are more than headaches?

31:57.560 --> 32:00.154
Your brain is like a radio receiver.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.598
It picks up other people's PSI waves.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.790
Their thoughts.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.836
Their rage.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.150
All those voices.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.313
The sheer volume of the telepathic input
causes severe pressure.

32:19.400 --> 32:23.188
However, a few, such as yourself,
are also senders.

32:23.280 --> 32:26.477
You can project your thoughts
into the world.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.749
Why? Why am I like this?

32:29.840 --> 32:32.434
Probably because of your mother.

32:33.920 --> 32:38.914
Back in the '50s and '60s, there was
an experimental drug called Ephemerol

32:39.000 --> 32:42.276
prescribed to a sizeable group
of pregnant women.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.954
It was supposed to ease discomfort.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.794
Instead, it caused an unusual birth defect.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.751
It created scanners.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.472
Can I turn it off?

32:57.560 --> 33:00.154
There is another drug, EPH-2.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.714
It'll relieve the pressure.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.394
Clear your mind, stop the headaches.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.630
And it's very addictive.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.154
The side effects can be devastating.

33:16.960 --> 33:21.397
David, you don't want to take the drug,

33:21.480 --> 33:23.994
under any circumstances.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.197
But it's got so much stronger lately.
In the last month.

33:27.280 --> 33:31.239
Probably because
you've never lived in a city before.

33:31.320 --> 33:35.393
In the country, everything's quieter, simpler.

33:36.240 --> 33:41.268
And the moral code is stronger.
The society is more stable.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.155
We lose our sense of values here.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.157
So my scanning ability
never had a chance to develop.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.356
It was latent for the most part.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.908
But subconsciously you knew how to use it.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.790
Now, what we want to do here
is teach you to control your power,

33:59.880 --> 34:04.078
so that you can use it
and protect yourself from overload.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.116
I need to do that.

34:07.320 --> 34:11.074
David, I'd like you to meet Peter Drak.
He's also a scanner.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.879
So a new a lab rat?

34:13.960 --> 34:16.554
He give you any of the magic potion yet?

34:16.639 --> 34:21.077
Peter has had a particularly difficult time
dealing with his special talent.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.835
- We're trying to help him.
- Yeah, they're lovely to me here.

34:24.920 --> 34:29.038
Took me to Lewis's, bought me
some threads. Very snappy, huh?

34:30.639 --> 34:33.757
Peter, you promised to cooperate.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.353
Maybe if I had one more shot.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.630
Sorry.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.391
I need another shot.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.789
You'll get one when we're finished.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.835
Sorry, David.

34:51.120 --> 34:54.396
"What pretty eyes you have," said the wolf.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.270
Block his scan, David.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.234
You can do it.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.153
Excellent. Excellent.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.754
Now, focus your scan.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.354
Link up with his nervous system.

35:15.320 --> 35:19.598
That's it. Gradually try to take control.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.469
- I'm sorry...
- I'm gonna make you pay.

35:39.560 --> 35:45.317
- Peter, Peter, that's enough.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

35:50.080 --> 35:52.594
You did very well, David.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.874
I didn't mean to hurt him.

35:56.960 --> 36:01.033
You protected yourself,
like you did at the store.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.796
I killed that man.

36:07.800 --> 36:11.873
It's terrible, I know. I've had to kill.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.916
Just as you had to.

36:16.720 --> 36:21.157
Now, listen, it was him or you.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.754
Him or Alice, wasn't it?

36:25.640 --> 36:27.596
I thought so.

36:28.640 --> 36:34.397
If you have a power, a power like yours,
not to use it is the real crime.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.274
Power obliges us, David.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.794
Hey, get your ass over here!

36:50.800 --> 36:54.634
One man over there
and a second man over by the door there.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.631
And a third man out on the catwalk.

36:56.720 --> 37:01.157
Even with all the security we've put on,
we haven't been able to find the milk killer.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.357
Now, this kind of criminal
is very hard to catch, David.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.556
I want you to help us.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.394
Just walk around. Make eye contact.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.312
And concentrate.

38:07.920 --> 38:09.672
You.

38:09.760 --> 38:13.230
- What do you want?
- Your name is Ralph Cheney.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.476
- Who are you?
- You've been working here 13 years.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.074
You feel you should
have been made the manager.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.037
You don't think that's fair.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.278
Get the hell out of here.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.273
That's why you injected
those milk cartons with strychnine.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.828
Oh, those poor children.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.916
Stop!

38:42.880 --> 38:45.838
- OK, I did it.
- Did what, Mr. Cheney?

38:45.920 --> 38:48.275
Poisoned the milk, two containers.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.113
- Oh! Oh!
- OK, enough, David, enough!

38:54.880 --> 38:56.836
Take him away.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.796
I don't get it.

39:11.680 --> 39:15.434
I've been working with the police.
I'm the one who found him.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.717
The milk murderer,
I'm the one who made him confess.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.756
Are you serious?

39:20.840 --> 39:23.149
Oh.

39:23.240 --> 39:29.588
By using my powers, I scanned the guy.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.432
Scanned?

39:31.520 --> 39:35.593
I used telepathy
to read his mind, see his thoughts.

39:37.320 --> 39:41.279
I have this power. I was born with it.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.196
I'm a scanner.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.634
Don't worry. It's good.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.636
I'm relieved.

39:54.240 --> 39:58.074
All my life I've felt
there was something wrong with me.

39:59.080 --> 40:04.234
I had this secret problem.
I felt ashamed, like I was a freak.

40:06.360 --> 40:11.150
Now this Captain uh... Forrester
has shown me it's not a problem.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.390
It's a gift.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.234
- It's amazing.
- No, you're amazing.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.236
David...

40:35.320 --> 40:37.072
Relax.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.116
I want to try something.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.390
God, what are you doing to me?

40:57.960 --> 40:59.916
Time is up.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.674
- Don't stop.
- Don't worry.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.030
You're under arrest.

42:33.160 --> 42:35.116
Get down on the floor.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.274
Keep your hands where I can see them.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.316
I've got a better idea.

42:41.400 --> 42:45.279
I'll stay here. You stay there.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.477
Now, open your mouth.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.956
Put the gun under your tongue.

43:01.080 --> 43:04.197
Good, Mitchie.

43:04.280 --> 43:08.353
Now, pull the trigger-wigger.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.594
I said pull it.

43:50.480 --> 43:52.391
Good morning, David.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.553
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I need you
to come with me right now.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.596
I'll be waiting for you.

44:06.240 --> 44:09.357
We're all awaiting
the arrival of Mayor Franzone,

44:09.440 --> 44:13.911
who will be confirming the apparent suicide
of Chief of Police Mitchel Stokes

44:14.000 --> 44:17.390
and announcing an acting chief
as his immediate successor.

44:17.480 --> 44:22.554
Sources close to the Mayor have confirmed
that her choice is Vice Chief Norman Yancy.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.916
That man Yancy, he's soft,
against everything we discussed.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.150
- But how do I know?
- He's not a leader.

44:28.240 --> 44:31.357
Under him, the city will get sicker,
probably die.

44:31.440 --> 44:35.877
David, cities die sometimes.
Do you know that?

44:35.960 --> 44:39.077
New York's already dead. Los Angeles...

44:42.000 --> 44:45.117
- I need you now.
- What do you want me to do?

44:45.200 --> 44:47.156
Scan the Mayor.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.196
Let's go. Come on.

44:49.280 --> 44:51.032
Officer.

44:52.880 --> 44:55.155
Sit in there.

45:07.480 --> 45:10.597
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor Franzone.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.989
This isn't right. She was elected.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.799
David, if we don't do it, nobody will.

45:22.960 --> 45:26.077
We did all right at the dairy
the other day, didn't we?

45:26.160 --> 45:28.310
- I deeply mourn...
- Trust me.

45:28.400 --> 45:32.279
...the death of my dear friend
Chief Mitchel Stokes.

45:32.360 --> 45:39.152
We are shocked and grieved
by his sudden departure.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.713
Because of the crucial nature
of the vacant post

45:43.800 --> 45:46.758
- and the present circumstances of the city...
- Do it.

45:46.840 --> 45:53.473
...l, as Mayor, believe it necessary to appoint
an acting chief of police without delay.

45:53.560 --> 45:55.198
Do it, David.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.396
Therefore, I...

45:57.480 --> 46:01.268
I am naming an interim successor...

46:02.080 --> 46:05.629
Let me introduce
our Acting Chief of Police...

46:05.720 --> 46:08.109
Commander...

46:09.160 --> 46:11.469
John Forrester.

46:25.360 --> 46:29.433
Thank you, Ms Mayor. I'm truly honored.

46:30.480 --> 46:34.029
The other night I said
this city needed a new order.

46:34.880 --> 46:40.000
Well, now the Mayor, in her wisdom,
has given me a chance to provide it.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.389
And I thank her.

46:42.480 --> 46:45.597
I give the people of this city my word,

46:45.680 --> 46:48.194
I will begin a new order.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.953
A new war against crime in our city.

46:52.040 --> 46:57.068
I'm going to begin
by giving the streets back to the people...

47:06.240 --> 47:09.198
- So you passed the big test, huh?
- Out of my way.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.829
He said he'd get you to do it,
but I didn't believe it. He's good.

47:12.920 --> 47:16.037
Forrester's good.
Have you ever scanned Forrester?

47:16.120 --> 47:20.591
Better than a splatter film.
You know how his new order works?

47:20.680 --> 47:23.638
They use scanners to control the society.

47:23.720 --> 47:27.474
- You're crazy.
- Maybe I am, but doesn't mean I'm wrong.

47:27.560 --> 47:32.350
You don't believe me? Check out
the scanners in Morse's basement.

47:32.440 --> 47:37.468
Cos if you don't work out for them, baby,
that's your next address.

47:52.280 --> 47:55.238
Aren't you going to tell me
what's the matter?

47:55.320 --> 47:57.470
Forrester's the new Chief of Police.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.709
I made it happen.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.429
Drak's a psycho case.

48:08.520 --> 48:14.550
I know so much of it could be true,
but... I have to find out...

48:14.640 --> 48:17.234
cos if there is something else going on...

48:17.320 --> 48:19.470
How are you going to know?

48:20.880 --> 48:23.189
I have to go over to the institute.

48:23.280 --> 48:25.236
See for myself.

48:26.960 --> 48:30.077
You don't know what
you could be walking into.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.116
I can protect myself.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.517
'Commander John Forrester.'

48:37.360 --> 48:40.477
'Mayor Franzone
was unavailable to comment

48:40.560 --> 48:42.869
'concerning the unexpected appointment,

48:42.960 --> 48:47.033
'but her office did confirm that
John Forrester would likely be replaced

48:47.120 --> 48:50.078
'by her permanent selection
for Chief of Police.'

48:50.160 --> 48:52.913
That's what she thinks.

48:55.960 --> 48:58.474
See what a clean scanner can do?

48:58.560 --> 49:04.078
It worked out OK this time, but I don't
know how long we can control him.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.038
Never mind. Leave David to me.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.190
We have a special relationship.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.751
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.473
Ah. Come in. Come in.

49:39.560 --> 49:41.869
David, is there something wrong?

49:41.960 --> 49:45.236
Uh... you're upset
about what happened today.

49:45.320 --> 49:48.551
I admit it was uh... unorthodox.

49:48.640 --> 49:52.713
That's right.
I want to find out what's really going on.

49:55.080 --> 49:58.197
Now, David, stop it. I have nothing to hide.

50:01.480 --> 50:03.675
David...

50:05.760 --> 50:07.955
Oh, God.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.872
It's true.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.436
Look at you.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.510
Enough, asshole.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.032
Ah!

50:30.480 --> 50:34.029
Now, David, two things to remember.

50:34.120 --> 50:37.237
First, never question my authority.

50:37.320 --> 50:41.108
And second, never, ever scan me.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.794
It won't work, your new order.

50:43.880 --> 50:46.792
- Why not?
- Cos I won't let it.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.279
Oh!

50:49.320 --> 50:50.878
Damn you!

51:13.960 --> 51:15.916
Shit!

51:18.080 --> 51:20.310
Shit!

51:29.200 --> 51:32.192
Gelson, David Kellum's loose.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.874
I want him back... alive.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.910
Hello?

51:48.000 --> 51:52.596
- David.
- No... no, I won't let them hurt you.

51:53.880 --> 51:56.997
- Well, what's the matter?
- I'm going home.

51:58.080 --> 52:01.436
- Home.
- David?

52:41.480 --> 52:43.789
David?

52:45.320 --> 52:47.470
Sorry to wake you, Miss Leonardo.

52:50.480 --> 52:53.597
I'm Lieutenant Gelson.
This is my colleague Mr. Drak.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.996
We're looking for David Kellum and believe
you know his present whereabouts.

52:59.960 --> 53:03.555
No... I have no idea.

53:03.640 --> 53:06.200
Are you sure about that, now?

53:09.560 --> 53:13.109
It's OK. We're finished here now.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.350
Sorry to bother you, miss.

53:56.680 --> 53:58.830
David?

53:58.920 --> 54:01.434
George! George!

54:06.240 --> 54:09.994
Ma, when you were pregnant with me,
you took a drug called Ephemerol.

54:10.080 --> 54:14.153
- What are you talking about?
- Ephemerol caused a birth defect.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.116
Birth defect?

54:17.200 --> 54:21.398
Quit treating me like a child.
Just tell me the truth.

54:21.480 --> 54:24.438
The truth? About what?

54:24.520 --> 54:27.114
Why you kept me away from the other kids.

54:28.120 --> 54:32.193
How I could get straight A's
in school without trying.

54:32.280 --> 54:35.317
The truth about my being a scanner.

54:38.760 --> 54:41.354
You know what that word means, don't you?

54:42.360 --> 54:48.879
Well... there was always something
very different about you, David.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.474
We're not really your parents, David.

55:07.160 --> 55:12.188
- I'm adopted?
- Eventually we adopted you. Yeah.

55:15.280 --> 55:17.794
Who are my real parents?

55:18.880 --> 55:21.997
Your mother's name was Kim Obrist.

55:23.040 --> 55:26.589
And your father was
a man called Cameron Vale.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.393
No one knows
what really happened to them.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.950
I'm afraid they're both dead.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.349
They died when you were still a baby.

55:39.720 --> 55:43.793
My parents... were they scanners?

55:45.360 --> 55:51.117
Yeah, they used that word. It was a long
time before we realized what it meant.

55:54.480 --> 55:56.436
Why did they give me away?

55:56.520 --> 56:02.550
They didn't. They asked us to watch over
you for a few months, until it was safe.

56:02.640 --> 56:04.949
They told us their lives were in danger.

56:05.880 --> 56:07.836
Obviously, they were right.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.512
Hello.

57:12.640 --> 57:16.076
My name's Gelson.
I'm a friend of your son David.

57:16.160 --> 57:19.709
- Is he here?
- No. No, he isn't.

57:22.840 --> 57:26.389
- When do you expect him back?
- Around Christmas time.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.469
You think I'm stupid, don't you, old man?

57:31.560 --> 57:34.358
You and your friend
are going to have to leave.

57:34.440 --> 57:37.557
- Sure, sure.
- This is private property.

57:37.640 --> 57:39.949
I understand.

58:11.400 --> 58:13.914
- Who are they?
- They're looking for David.

58:14.000 --> 58:16.878
Go upstairs, call Sheriff Johnson and hurry.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.916
- Who are they?
- Hurry, hurry!

58:30.520 --> 58:32.511
I thought I told you...

58:51.640 --> 58:55.189
'District Sheriff's office.
Deputy Berry speaking.

58:55.280 --> 58:58.511
'Hello? Hello?

58:58.600 --> 59:02.195
'Sheriff's office,
is there anyone there? Hello?'

59:07.640 --> 59:10.757
'Hey, what the hell's going on there?
Speak to me!'

59:10.840 --> 59:12.910
Sorry. She can't talk right now.

59:42.480 --> 59:44.436
Dad!

59:47.560 --> 59:51.109
Upstairs. Help her. Upstairs.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.189
No...

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.676
- How is he?
- Hurry!

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.309
Here, let me.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.276
Dad.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.874
It's gonna be OK.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.349
I won't let you go!

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.757
All right. He's coming back.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:55.594
'You don't have to speak.
I can hear your thoughts.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.636
'I need you, Father.'

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.796
'You're all I've got left.'

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.989
'No, David. You have someone else.'

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.389
- 'What?'
- 'An older sister.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.518
'Her name is... Julie.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.950
'She lives up north.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.754
'Lake Washeneska.'

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:31.312
- 'Hello?'
- Hi, it's me.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.554
David, don't say anything.
The police are watching me.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.791
- They came for you.
- They killed my mother.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:45.317
I... just called to make sure you're OK.

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.437
- They're probably listening, so I gotta go.
- David, I love you.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.080
I love you, too.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.472
Hello?

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.472
Hello?

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.588
'God, you look so much like Father.'

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:16.197
When I left the hospital,
he was going to make it.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.429
What do they want from me?

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:25.069
To control you. To use you.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.277
I'm not a thing, a tool.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.596
To them, you are.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.797
Everyone is. It was
the same with Mom and Dad.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.276
Your real mom and dad.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.993
They were talking to other scanners,
bringing them together.

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.596
Discussing what they should do
with their... powers.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.117
There are some people who wanted
to use them and you can imagine how.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:05.236
Mom and Dad opposed that.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.390
So they killed them.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.757
This... gift...

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.917
makes our lives impossible.
It's why I came up here.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.676
Eight years.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.076
I'll never go back.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:41.036
Aren't you lonely?

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.114
I had a boyfriend back there.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.350
My fiancé.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.590
Don't scan me.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.713
I don't like it. Ask and I'll tell you.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.756
Yes, Walter was a scanner.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.433
That's what you wanted to know, right?

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:17.834
I still think about him all the time.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.677
Being with another scanner, was that...

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.716
It was easier in a way.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.830
Things you didn't have to explain.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:34.471
But Walter was worried
about what to do with his power.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.430
So he entered a programme
and they gave him a new drug.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.556
EPH-2.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.472
EPH-1. It was eight years ago.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.994
- Morse.
- And Forrester.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:54.389
He's the one who killed Dad.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.310
I tried to get Walter away,
but he was addicted.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.393
One day... he disappeared.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:09.796
And the cops came after me.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.836
I had to kill two of them.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.798
- Someone has to stop them.
- Don't even try.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.953
They're animals, David.
Let them destroy each other.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.235
- They're human.
- But we're not.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.952
Not really.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.232
I love a girl back there.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.356
A normal girl?

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.470
You poor boy.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.391
It won't work.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.116
- I have to try.
- David, I've been through it.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.838
David.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.232
I do, too.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.633
Sorry, Miss Leonardo, but orders are
to keep you here until this is cleared up.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.837
If you need anything,
we'll be glad to get it for you.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.674
- Just one more question.
- Make it fast.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.877
Lately you've been putting yourself
more in the public eye.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.270
Clearly you've become an advocate
for change in our society.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.712
What's the question?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:12.590
Well, would it be fair to assume that
you're considering running for mayor?

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:19.678
Well, you know, Kerry, the voters are looking
for someone to keep this city under control,

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:24.787
so... well, if the people need me...

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.633
yes, I'll run.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.471
- Excuse me.
- Cut.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.792
'The forecast, cloudy skies.
We can expect up to an inch of snow...'

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.634
'... Mayor Franzone's
dismal failure to halt crime in our city.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.919
'Acting Police Chief Forrester intends
to challenge the Mayor in the election.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.357
'Furthermore, a news radio poll has
revealed that of 100 sampled voters,

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:52.877
'more than half would vote for Chief
Forrester if the election were held today.'

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.356
Oh, excuse me.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.238
- Excuse me, sir.
- I'm gonna win this election.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.437
- No doubt, sir.
- And you know what that means?

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.078
What, sir?

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.277
That you are going to be
the next Chief of Police.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.316
But only if you find David Kellum.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.190
I don't care if you have to use every man
in this department, but just bring him back,

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.998
dead or alive.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.674
Funny you should mention him.
We just spotted him.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.877
- Where?
- He's parked right outside City Hall.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.837
Friday, two o'clock.
Perfect, thank you. Bye-bye.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.388
Pardon me, ma'am, a gentleman to see you.

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.198
I told you not to disturb me.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.795
It's about Chief Forrester.
He says it's important.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:08.396
- Who are you?
- Please, just sit down and listen.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.110
My name is David Kellum.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.873
I know you didn't mean to appoint
Forrester as Chief of Police.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.916
How do you know that?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.116
Because I made you do it.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.637
I was born with a kind of... telepathic ability.

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.676
I used it on you.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:33.513
There are others like me.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.229
Forrester has forced
some of us to work for him.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.038
They call us scanners.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.156
Scanners?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.717
- Please, Mr. Kellum, don't make...
- Don't make you laugh.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.873
I can make you laugh. I can make you cry.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.871
I can make you do anything.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.678
Have a cigarette.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.069
I don't smoke.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.349
Those are just for...

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.952
Tell me more about this.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.198
- Forrester.
- 'It's Gelson. I found Kellum.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:31.673
'He's at the Mayor's house. I can see them
through the window. They're talking.'

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.796
You know what to do.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.076
Using scanners,
Forrester can control anyone.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.230
Unless we stop him now.

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:53.118
- 'Internal Affairs.'
- This is Mayor Franzone.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:57.273
I need to speak with the Assistant Director
right now. Tell him...

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.670
Oh, my God.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.390
There he is! Fire!

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.879
Find him and call me.
Don't let anyone through.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.193
'There's been a shooting
at the Mayor's house.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.589
'Our news reporter is rushing to the scene.'

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:09.878
- We got him.
- Take good care of him.

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.397
Hey, Davie, time for a little one on one.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.712
We're both scanners, Drak.
Why help them?

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.429
They're going to use you and throw
you away. You know it. You told me.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.796
And what are you gonna do, Dave,
be my best friend?

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.674
We can work together, all of us!

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.877
No! Protect each other!

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.269
Put our powers to some decent use.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.078
I like this use.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.638
Power doesn't make you good, Dave.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.711
It just makes you powerful.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:56.472
And it makes me hungry.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:00.109
I'm gonna suck you dry, pretty boy.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.156
Hurry up! Get in!

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.510
'... a few minutes later and Police Lieutenant
Gelson took charge of the operation.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.149
'Before the police intervened,
shots were fired inside the house.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.073
'The Mayor was declared dead
on arrival at the hospital

'and police confirmed that she died

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.589
Smells good. What's cooking?

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.989
Soup.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.469
- Want some?
- Yeah, sure. Why not?

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:55.149
That's the same place, all right.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:59.552
I'm pretty sure one of those guards is
a scanner. How am I going to get past him?

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.636
Just before he died...

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.590
Dad taught me a trick.

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.716
We practiced it a few times.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.634
If I can remember... how.

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.075
Show me.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:23.396
Look into my eyes and do as I say.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.036
Scan me.

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.638
Lightly.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.472
No, lighter.

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.668
If you want to slip into my mind, go gently.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.876
Keep trying.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.712
Concentrate.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.956
That's better.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:02.877
Now, get... behind... my eyes.

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:06.356
And look out.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.072
But...

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:17.948
- You just turned into me.
- Because you're looking through my eyes.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.956
My eyes...

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.474
- It's Gelson.
- Let's use him.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.036
- You see?
- Yes.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.434
Lieutenant, is something the matter?

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.476
I'm fine. Just open the gate.

01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:05.672
Lighten up.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.318
Pull back.

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.996
Hi.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.516
He doesn't even know we're there.

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.749
Relax your control.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.796
Let him go on with his business.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.036
Let's take over.

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.233
Look around.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.234
Remember the code.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.029
The scanners.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.553
Or what's left of them.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:41.036
Oh, God.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.950
Walter.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.349
He's alive.

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.197
Gelson, you're not supposed to be in here.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.474
Morse.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.074
I thought I heard something.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.117
I've waited eight years for this.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.873
Oh. Argh!

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:41.037
Let's give the doctor
a taste of his own medicine.

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.153
There's someone else.

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.470
Knock, knock.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.469
Is that you in there, Davie?

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.990
This is fun.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.756
It's like playing with a puppet.

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.636
Argh!

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.872
Ah! Argh!

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.516
Did you get 'em?

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.915
Look, I haven't seen anything up here.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.312
Oh!

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.716
It's all right.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.711
It'll wear off. Just give it time.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.313
Go help Walter.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.356
I'll be fine.

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.759
Go.

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:50.717
Sir, we have to leave. I've arranged
an interview before the reception.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.918
Yes?

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.719
'Excuse me, sir.
There's been an emergency.'

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:14.237
What's the matter, got a little nosebleed?

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.475
Not bad, pretty boy.

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:58.274
Your name's Walter.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.158
- Who are you?
- My name's David Kellum.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.074
My sister's Julie. Julie Vale, remember?

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.636
Julie...

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.234
No.

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.511
She's waiting upstairs.
We came to help you.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.909
All of you!

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.069
You're killing yourselves here!

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.876
You have to get out.

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.876
Nobody is going anywhere.

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.269
This is the big feed.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.876
I'll finish you now.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.269
Like I did your loving mother.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:47.112
You bastard.

01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:49.678
Bye-bye, cutie.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.270
- No!
- Get out of my way!

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.198
Urgh!

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:44.836
Find them.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:30:59.036
Argh!

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.676
This can't be.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:48.238
Don't move.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.276
Turn that camera off!

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.273
- You're not going to talk to anybody.
- What's going on here, Chief Forrester?

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.318
For security reasons,
you have to clear the area.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.834
Have you been using
psychics called scanners?

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:04.150
There are no scanners. It's a myth.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:07.471
- Chief Forrester...
- I'm sorry. You all have to leave.

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:11.314
What is your response to allegations
that you have deliberately...

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:15.154
that you have deliberately assassinated
criminals to gain popularity?

01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:20.314
Nonsense. We've just captured
the Mayor's assassin inside this building.

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.799
His name is David Kellum.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.953
But we have just learned that David Kellum
is not an escaped mental patient.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.554
He may be a scanner.
What is your comment?

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.189
Kellum's a maniac
and there's no such thing as a scanner.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.236
You're a liar.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:38.677
Are you trying to tell us that David Kellum
is responsible for all this violence?

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:43.675
Of course not. Kellum had accomplices,
drug addicts. They're all inside.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.354
Why don't you just tell the truth?

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:48.590
That girl is one of them. Arrest her.

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.716
No!

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:01.190
Urgh, no! No, it's not true!

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.635
Come on. Stop it. Can't get away.

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.109
Stop it, stop it...

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:15.836
Stop it!

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.357
All right, I'll say it.

01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:25.274
Everything. I...
I only had to do it to save the order!

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.078
The new order, the future!

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.912
What did you have to do, sir?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.309
Argh!

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.949
I ordered Chief Stokes killed!

01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.669
The Mayor and... and... and...

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.758
murdered.

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.269
You should come with us, sir.

01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:53.354
I only did it to save the society.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.876
Argh!

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.236
No pictures!

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.476
Enough.

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.636
No more killing.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:12.870
We didn't want this. We mean you no harm.

01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:22.116
We're just here to help.
