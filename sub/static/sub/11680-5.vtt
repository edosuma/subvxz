Oh, no, no, no,
we just, uh,

09:17.133 --> 09:18.901
Didn't want to see the guy
hurt himself or anybody else.

09:18.968 --> 09:22.100
Those are the magic words every
time this guy goes to court.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.167
Oh, so he's been in
before?
oh, yeah.

09:24.234 --> 09:25.667

09:25.734 --> 09:27.734

09:31.767 --> 09:33.267
Take care.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.167
Well, if you're looking
for a silver lining,

09:35.234 --> 09:37.434
It's nice to know that we
can still call the cops, huh?

09:37.501 --> 09:39.100

10:10.167 --> 10:12.200
Hey, you know
i don't like charging you,

10:12.267 --> 10:13.634
But that was a big favor.

10:13.701 --> 10:15.801

i got to stay with my mom.

10:15.868 --> 10:18.601
She's still mad at me i
dropped out of podiatry school.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.434
Makes me nuts.

10:20.501 --> 10:24.234

Not shocked, no.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.400
But it wasn't
a total dead end, though.

11:08.901 --> 11:11.667
I'm so sorry to bother you
at home, especially after...

11:11.734 --> 11:14.834
I-i shouldn't have done that...
with the table.

was just explaining

well, they
may as well have.</i>

The nurses at that place
don't even disguise
the pattern of the rounds,

11:28.267 --> 11:29.968

are child's play.

11:30.801 --> 11:33.434

i know you were just testing me.

be out in the open like this.

for me.

i broke out of a psych ward.

11:43.434 --> 11:44.901

11:44.968 --> 11:47.801
Spencer, we can't do anything

11:47.868 --> 11:50.300
I know people think my mind's
not right, but i am right.

11:50.367 --> 11:52.534
I'm right about this.
they killed my friend brad.

12:21.734 --> 12:23.434

12:23.501 --> 12:25.400
Yeah. sometimes
i lose track of things

on the ceiling.

no. that's...

12:29.400 --> 12:32.367
Oh, okay.
we can start there.

12:32.434 --> 12:35.033
This is the one
i was telling you about.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.801
Three killed in the past
four months, just like i said.

12:37.868 --> 12:40.934
You said "aliens."
this looks like american spies.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.200
Well, the forms they take
vary, but --
you're saying

12:43.267 --> 12:46.334
These men were outed by
an executive at stone kittredge?

12:46.400 --> 12:48.968
Yes, that's
what i'm saying.
wait a second.
ronald papa?

12:49.033 --> 12:50.901
They said this
was a climbing accident.

12:50.968 --> 12:53.501
Mike, this guy was
a friend of mine.
i mean, i worked with him.

12:53.567 --> 12:55.601
Oh -- oh, good. so, you worked
with one of the guardians.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.033
No. don't do that.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.667
I just sent flowers
to ron's wife last month,

12:58.734 --> 13:01.467
So don't be making up stories
about real people.

13:01.534 --> 13:04.667
Oh, i'm not. i lost a friend,
too -- my friend brad,

13:04.734 --> 13:06.901
T-the one t-they killed
to cover it up.

13:06.968 --> 13:08.467

13:08.534 --> 13:10.801
See, uh, you have to --
you just have to read all these.

13:10.868 --> 13:12.167
Please,
just read them all.

13:12.234 --> 13:15.234
Spencer, these are just
a bunch of newspaper articles.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.767
Oh, no. there's a pattern.
you have to see the pattern.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.367
I-it's all connected.

13:19.434 --> 13:22.234
There's a galactic war between
these -- uh, the bad ones.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.300
The ones from procyon "a"
are hunting the guardians,

13:25.367 --> 13:27.200
And guys like brad,
who get in the middle,

13:27.267 --> 13:29.901
They'll kill them, a-and
then the darkness will come.

13:29.968 --> 13:32.367
Unless you --
it's up to you to stop them.

13:34.968 --> 13:37.367

i know this guy.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.834
He's a good guy.
he's a good doctor.

equals "spies"...

14:16.601 --> 14:20.033
Spencer, i was really hoping
you were just crazy.

14:33.267 --> 14:35.634
Sam: okay. let me
get this straight.

14:35.701 --> 14:37.967
2007, stone kittredge
gets the contract

14:38.034 --> 14:41.467
To provide secure communications
between american embassies.

14:41.534 --> 14:43.701
So they do
the usual firewall crap,

14:43.768 --> 14:45.567
Plus they come up
with a code.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.900
Called zydeco, yes.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.567
Okay, and you think
somebody there

14:48.634 --> 14:50.567
Is intercepting
these encrypted e-mails

14:50.634 --> 14:52.501
And selling the names
of american spies.

14:52.567 --> 14:53.768
That's your bogus theory.

14:53.833 --> 14:56.167
What these procyon beings
are really doing

14:56.234 --> 14:58.401
Is exposing the guardians
from ross 154.

14:58.467 --> 15:00.067
Right, like
my buddy ronnie.

15:00.134 --> 15:02.601
But how do you know
it's somebody inside
of stone kittredge

15:02.668 --> 15:04.301
And not some whack job
on the outside

15:04.367 --> 15:06.434
Who just cracked
the code?
uh, that's absurd.

15:06.501 --> 15:09.100
Absurd like "aliens
are sending me messages

15:09.167 --> 15:10.601
Through the pennysaver"
absurd?

15:10.668 --> 15:13.200

it's a four-kilobyte code.

15:13.267 --> 15:16.034

of miss reynolds on my phone

15:16.100 --> 15:18.234
Bigger than that.
no, an algorithmic code

15:18.301 --> 15:20.734
That takes up four kilobytes
of space is beyond secure.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.401
It would take longer
than the whole life of
the universe to crack it.

15:23.467 --> 15:26.634
That -- that's impossible.
the-- the-- there's no way.

15:26.701 --> 15:28.601
You'd really need the code
to read those messages.

15:28.668 --> 15:29.967
All right. fine.
relax.

15:30.034 --> 15:31.434
Maybe there's another way
that we can do this.

she has access to the

she's an alien.

of zydeco,

16:04.900 --> 16:06.100

18:25.100 --> 18:26.833
You ready to go?

18:26.900 --> 18:28.401
To dinner?
it's 4:30.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.933
I told you
no more early-bird specials.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.734
Yeah. i thought we would
stop by the airport first,

18:33.800 --> 18:36.234
Pay a visit to that
front business barry found.

18:36.301 --> 18:37.434
More spy hunting?

18:37.501 --> 18:38.967
Michael, why must
everything you do

18:39.034 --> 18:40.734
Revolve around
getting your old job back?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.833
Fiona, really,
this is important.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.034
Oh, michael, come on.

18:46.534 --> 18:47.634
I'll do it alone.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.334
We're gonna have to do this
eventually.

18:53.401 --> 18:54.668
Yeah.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.833
Just not right now.

19:00.234 --> 19:03.267
<i>drug cartels
aren't the only organizations</i>

19:03.334 --> 19:06.034
<i>who use import/export
businesses as fronts.</i>

19:06.100 --> 19:08.467
<i>intelligence agencies like them
because they make it possible</i>

19:08.534 --> 19:10.467
<i>for missions
to finance themselves.</i>

19:10.534 --> 19:12.367
Who parked
that gray truck out there?

19:12.434 --> 19:14.800
Where's your boss?

19:14.867 --> 19:18.234
<i>they send out guns and supplies
and get back goods to sell.</i>

19:18.301 --> 19:20.067
<i>native antiquities
are favorites</i>

19:20.134 --> 19:22.467
<i>because their subjective prices
make money laundering easy.</i>

19:22.534 --> 19:23.800
Are you the manager?

19:26.401 --> 19:28.034
No, mr. westen.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.967
I'm diego garza.
i'm the spy you're looking for.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.134
You're really not supposed
to tell people you're a spy.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.701
What's the point
in subterfuge?

19:37.768 --> 19:39.401
All the memos they sent
from d.c.,

19:39.467 --> 19:40.967
They say
you're very, very good.

19:41.034 --> 19:43.867
I have to assume you're here
because you want back in.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.234
Trying to reach out?

19:45.301 --> 19:48.034
I like you, diego. you're
doing all the work for me.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.200
I don't want this
to hurt your feelings,

19:50.267 --> 19:53.034
But i'd really like you
to get the hell out of here.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.534
Not everything they told you
about me is true.

19:55.601 --> 19:57.467
Well, the part about me
being really, really good.

19:57.534 --> 20:01.000
But i just want to
talk to your bosses
so we can clear this up.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.867
[ sighs, chuckles ]
i wish it was that simple.

20:03.933 --> 20:07.467
I have 20 years at the company.
i've seen villages burned.

20:07.534 --> 20:10.134
I've seen children orphaned.
i've been shot twice.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.034
And then
they transferred me here.

20:12.100 --> 20:14.701
Now, you know what
the hardest part of this job is?

20:14.768 --> 20:17.301
That forklift turns funny.

20:17.367 --> 20:20.734
Now, if i report back that i
made contact with a burned spy,

20:20.800 --> 20:22.200
Do you know
where they'll send me?

20:23.768 --> 20:27.367
Me neither,
but i'm not rocking this boat.

20:27.434 --> 20:30.800
I'm giving you a chance
to be a friend.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.467
Mr. westen,
i don't like threats.

20:37.067 --> 20:39.134
But i love your sunglasses.
[ chuckles ]

20:39.200 --> 20:40.867
You have a good one, okay?

20:48.334 --> 20:50.900
<i>doing a job in broad daylight</i>

20:50.967 --> 20:53.367
<i>means easier access
but more witnesses.</i>

20:53.434 --> 20:55.800
<i>you can walk right in
with your unwanted audience,</i>

20:55.867 --> 20:57.734
<i>but you better have a plan
to entertain them.</i>

20:57.800 --> 21:00.034
Well, all right.

21:00.100 --> 21:03.867
Ladies and gentlemen,
if i can borrow your attention,

21:03.933 --> 21:06.367
I promise to return it
in about an hour.

21:06.434 --> 21:09.900
My name is charles finley.
you can call me charles.

21:09.967 --> 21:11.867
[ laughs ]
no.

21:11.933 --> 21:13.734
I'm the dreaded
teamwork consultant

21:13.800 --> 21:15.401
That popped up
on your calendar there.

21:15.467 --> 21:16.867
So come on, everybody.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.200
Follow me in to the conference
room right now. let's go.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.833
There's gonna be ice-cream cake.
it's my birthday.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.267
Let's go. come on.
did i mention ice-cream cake?

21:24.334 --> 21:27.467
Come on, folks. come on. break
free from your cubicle, eh?

21:27.534 --> 21:29.701
That's the ticket.

21:29.768 --> 21:32.933
Oh, they warned me
about you, ms. park.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.200
I don't have time
for this.
oh, now, come on,
boss lady.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.367
Let's be a good example
for everybody, huh?

21:37.434 --> 21:38.534
What do you say?

21:38.601 --> 21:41.234
Hey, folks.
let's do this thing.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.134
[ chuckles lightly ]

21:50.933 --> 21:53.534
Have they all been taken?

21:53.601 --> 21:55.768
Yeah,
to the conference room.

21:58.434 --> 22:00.367
Next chapter is entitled

22:00.434 --> 22:04.800
"talk to me: enhancing
your empowerment sphere."

22:08.401 --> 22:10.200
Let's make this quick.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.301
Has anyone here
heard of the seventh sigma?

22:21.367 --> 22:24.634
This is the newest commandment
in the business bible, people.

22:24.701 --> 22:25.701
Anyone?

22:25.768 --> 22:27.401
Todd.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.933
Though shalt not lie
about ice-cream cake?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.401
[ laughs ]
oh, todd.

22:32.467 --> 22:34.933
You're a joker, todd.
you're gonna stay after class.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.800
See, that's all --
do you see that?

22:37.867 --> 22:40.100
That encryption is zydeco.
those are all...

22:40.167 --> 22:41.567
She shouldn't have those.

22:41.634 --> 22:44.267
Those are all coded e-mails
she's stealing.

22:44.334 --> 22:45.967
Yeah. i was right.

22:46.034 --> 22:48.933
Okay, spencer, i can't send
a page of numbers to the fbi.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.467
I need the code.
oh, i don't like this.

22:50.534 --> 22:52.601
Does she have it or not?
no. i don't see it.

22:52.668 --> 22:53.900
Look, though.
look at this.

22:53.967 --> 22:55.867
She wiped all her
bank records within 24 hours

22:55.933 --> 22:57.833
Of accessing the system --
here, here again.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.334
Every time she...

23:00.401 --> 23:03.000
Spencer.
spencer, i need you to focus.

23:03.067 --> 23:06.067
There's no point
in her intercepting the e-mails

23:06.134 --> 23:07.833
If she can't decrypt them.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.734
No, no. listen, every time
there's a payment --

23:10.800 --> 23:14.601
Yesterday, today, twice.
oh, she sent two more names out.

23:14.668 --> 23:16.334
Oh. i don't know
where it's gonna happen next.

23:16.401 --> 23:18.034
I don't know who's gonna die.
two more, but --

23:18.100 --> 23:21.100
Spencer, it's gonna be fine
if you find the code right now.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.434
No. i told you. it's not here.
she's too careful.

23:23.501 --> 23:25.534
She must borrow the copy
that they keep in the scif room

23:25.601 --> 23:26.634
And put it back
when she's done.

23:26.701 --> 23:28.134
Oh, god.
i should've seen it.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.067
Wait. now you're telling me
that her copy of the code

23:31.134 --> 23:33.034
Is in a scif room?!

23:33.100 --> 23:35.434
That's a vault!
oh, no. i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.234
The pattern. i didn't see it.
i didn't see any of this.
get out of the chair!

23:41.501 --> 23:44.634
...which brings us
to the finley method.

23:44.701 --> 23:46.933
Oh. excuse me. i'm sorry.
are you leaving us?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.501
I have work to do.

23:48.567 --> 23:51.734
Folks, be right back.
turn to page seven.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.634
Hey, hey!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:53.701 --> 23:55.334
Hey! shannon!
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:55.401 --> 23:57.668
I'm sending myself a copy
of everything encrypted.

23:57.734 --> 23:58.933
Let's go.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.367
Let's hit the reset button.
do it together.

24:01.434 --> 24:03.267
Hit the button.
let's reset the clock.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.067
No. wait. we have to --
we have to take her machines.

24:05.134 --> 24:06.800
No. we have to take
her machines.

24:06.867 --> 24:08.434
We have to find the names.
she could have buried it.
spencer!

24:08.501 --> 24:11.200
No. we -- we have to warn
the guardians. no! we have to!

24:11.267 --> 24:12.467
The darkness will come.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.734
The darkness will come,
and you'll see!

24:13.800 --> 24:14.967
You'll look up,
the stars will go out,

24:15.034 --> 24:16.800
And every night,
every night --

24:16.867 --> 24:19.234
[ loudly ] we can be positive,
shannon. this is all about...

24:19.301 --> 24:21.267
That's enough.

24:21.334 --> 24:24.100
[ in distance ] you're killing
me here. oh, come on.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.200
Enough.

24:36.367 --> 24:38.534
Come on, spencer.
come on.

24:38.601 --> 24:40.933
They're all gonna die.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.668
We don't have the code.
they're all gonna die.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.300
Spencer: i could --

24:51.367 --> 24:53.934
I-i'll try to hack into
shannon's computer
again remotely.

24:54.001 --> 24:55.333
If i leave a line open,

24:55.400 --> 24:57.333
Maybe i can catch her
when she uses the code.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.934
You can't --
if you get caught,

24:59.001 --> 25:01.067
She can trace
where you live and --
she sent more names!

25:01.134 --> 25:03.067
We don't know who or where,
but we know they're gonna die,

25:03.134 --> 25:04.567
And those files
you stole from her computer

25:04.634 --> 25:06.367
Are useless
without a copy of zydeco.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.534
Well, that's not true.
we can use --
there's no point in trying.

25:11.433 --> 25:13.201
No. there's no use
in even -- even --

25:13.268 --> 25:15.234
Even attempting
to break that code.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.400
You understand?
the whole life of the universe.

25:17.467 --> 25:19.534
Listen, please!
no. i know
you're trying to help,

25:19.600 --> 25:23.034
But if you think you
can break in to the scif
room to steal that code,

25:23.101 --> 25:25.034
No, i'm sorry,
that's never gonna happen.

25:25.101 --> 25:26.734
You see,
there's a nine-digit keypad.

25:26.801 --> 25:29.067
I'm not going --
and shannon and her friends
from procyon "a"

25:29.134 --> 25:31.034
Won't just sit back
and watch.

25:31.101 --> 25:32.967
[ sighs ]

25:34.767 --> 25:38.034
Spencer, michael
isn't going to decrypt

25:38.101 --> 25:40.201
The e-mails
that shannon stole.

25:40.268 --> 25:42.934
He's going to use them
as a prop to scare her.

25:43.001 --> 25:44.268
No.
i don't see that.

25:45.067 --> 25:46.967
[ sighs ]

25:47.034 --> 25:50.367
We're gonna convince her that
someone's hunting for the leak.

25:50.433 --> 25:51.700
She'll stop selling names,
cover her tracks.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.300
We'll tip the fbi

25:53.367 --> 25:55.901
When she goes to erase
the scif room's access code.

25:55.967 --> 25:58.300
She'll be arrested,
and no more spies die.

25:58.367 --> 26:00.967
There's justice
for your friend.

26:01.034 --> 26:03.101
The alien goes to jail.

26:03.168 --> 26:06.268
Oh, well, that sounds good.
is that what you were gonna say?

26:14.101 --> 26:15.967
If you
want to keep your job,

26:16.034 --> 26:19.067
Keep walking, keep your
voice down, and act casual.

26:19.134 --> 26:21.567
We don't have a jeremy dresner
in virginia. i checked.

26:21.634 --> 26:23.400
Who are you, and --
the people
we both work for

26:23.467 --> 26:25.801
Don't know my name,
and neither will you.

26:25.867 --> 26:28.101
I'm the guy cleaning up
your mess. that's all you get.

26:28.168 --> 26:30.667
What mess? two days ago,
you were an i.t. guy.

26:30.734 --> 26:32.101
Two days ago,
i was shaking the tree.

26:32.168 --> 26:35.234
There's a leak coming from tech.
that's your department.

26:35.333 --> 26:37.934
We're staring down the barrel
of a federal case

26:38.001 --> 26:40.834
And a massive p.r. disaster --
zydeco's compromised.

26:40.901 --> 26:43.034
Three american operatives
are already dead.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.268
This is ridiculous.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.467
I don't know who you are.
i'm calling my boss.

26:46.534 --> 26:49.400
Go ahead. use mine
if you'd rather deal

26:49.467 --> 26:51.367
With a massive
federal investigation.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.634
Shannon, the feds
are just sniffing at this now.

26:53.700 --> 26:54.734
We got two days.

26:54.801 --> 26:55.934
After that,
your stock options

26:56.001 --> 26:57.734
Won't be worth the paper
they're printed on.

26:57.801 --> 26:59.834
This doesn't make
any sense.

26:59.901 --> 27:03.467
<i>that embassy system is airtight.
zydeco was my project.</i>

27:03.534 --> 27:04.901
Believe me, honey,
i know it was.

27:06.567 --> 27:08.168
Where did you get that?

27:08.234 --> 27:09.567
I need you to call upstairs,

27:09.634 --> 27:11.634
Cancel all your appointments
for the day.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.201
There's something
i need you to see.

27:15.934 --> 27:19.134
Two weeks ago, i get a call
from one of our employers.

27:19.201 --> 27:21.967
One of your programmers
in your department

27:22.034 --> 27:23.201
Got himself blown up --

27:23.268 --> 27:24.234
Brad wilkins.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.801
They asked me
to have a look.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.500
Cops said
that was an accident.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.634
Yeah. miami dade detectives
make 56 grand a year.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.834
How much
do you think i make?

27:31.901 --> 27:34.034
They didn't even know
about this boat.

27:34.101 --> 27:36.967
Your boy brad had it registered
under his mother's name.

27:37.034 --> 27:39.600
He was careful,
just not careful enough.
where'd he get those?

27:39.667 --> 27:42.333
That's what we're trying to find
out. try to keep up, honey.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.333
Notes in the margins --
now, i learned about the leak

27:44.400 --> 27:45.634
Because brad found out
about the leak.

27:45.700 --> 27:46.834
He was hunting them.

27:46.901 --> 27:48.834
Why he didn't share this news,
i don't know,

27:48.901 --> 27:51.567
But he sure did
get himself killed.
what do the notes say?

27:51.634 --> 27:54.600
He wanted to look
at the scif access logs.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.834
Now i do.

tried to kill me.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.034
You know, i'll walk with you.
i have to make a stop myself.

38:16.100 --> 38:18.200
And, you guys, thank you --
thank you for --
for listening to me.

38:18.267 --> 38:21.067
You probably shouldn't have
listened to anything i said,
but i'm glad you did.

38:21.134 --> 38:23.067
Spencer?

38:25.167 --> 38:26.634
You got him a job.

38:26.701 --> 38:28.367
I actually am
kind of a sweetheart.

38:30.234 --> 38:33.267
So, there's one more thing
i wanted to tell you
about all the aliens.

38:33.334 --> 38:35.701
Uh, spencer,
i thought that you were --
oh, oh, no, no.

38:35.768 --> 38:39.167
I-i know they're not real.
i just wanted to explain.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.000
Well, i-in the beginning,
the first messages,

38:42.067 --> 38:43.367
This light in the window,

38:43.434 --> 38:45.200
This --
this beautiful equation --

38:45.267 --> 38:46.933
I should have just
said something.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.267
I-i should have just
told people.

38:49.334 --> 38:51.833
But it was --
it was all secret and in code,

38:51.900 --> 38:54.467
And -- and i didn't have
anyone i could trust.

38:54.534 --> 38:56.933
A-and you're lucky. you're just
lucky to have people like that.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.367
Well, if there's
ever anything i can do...

39:01.434 --> 39:03.200
Yeah.

39:11.534 --> 39:13.033
Hey.

39:15.801 --> 39:17.401
I had some bowls
like that once.

39:17.467 --> 39:20.167
That is crazy.
i got this in an online auction.

39:20.234 --> 39:21.868
Had to beat out
some nasty russians

39:21.933 --> 39:24.401
Who were overbidding
on everything.

39:24.467 --> 39:27.033
I knew you liked colombian art,
so i thought,

39:27.100 --> 39:29.067
"what better way to say
i still want us to be friends"?

39:33.167 --> 39:36.734
Yes. my boss has noticed
your auction screen name.

39:36.801 --> 39:38.234
Michaelheartsdiego.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.768
You heard about that.
i'm embarrassed.

39:40.834 --> 39:42.134
Nice choice you gave me.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.567
Cop to the fact
that i made contact with you,

39:44.634 --> 39:48.033
Or admit to skimming
and accepting bribes
from enemies of the state.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.434
Did you choose "a"?
you're getting
what you want.

39:50.501 --> 39:53.167
I've been assigned to be your
point of contact here in miami.

39:53.234 --> 39:55.367
You see? now you
don't have to leave town.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.167
No one has to lose.
it's a win-win.

39:57.234 --> 39:59.267
Well, i get to win twice.

39:59.334 --> 40:02.134
The new perk of my job is
that i get to tell you this --

40:02.200 --> 40:05.267
The company is not interested
in your services at this time.

40:05.334 --> 40:07.100
Really?

40:08.667 --> 40:11.534
Maybe you should show them
this.
they know.

40:11.601 --> 40:13.367
Did you really think
that would get you back in?

40:13.434 --> 40:16.200
The boys upstairs don't
want to pin a medal on anyone

40:16.267 --> 40:18.868
For that mess.

40:18.933 --> 40:20.701
They want to sweep it
under the rug.

40:20.768 --> 40:23.300
Get to know me, diego.

40:23.367 --> 40:26.401
I'm not
one of the bad guys.

40:26.467 --> 40:27.701
Michael...

40:29.134 --> 40:32.134
...they did say
they'd review your file.

40:32.200 --> 40:35.868
I wouldn't hold my breath,
but who knows?

40:51.634 --> 40:52.834
[ sighs ]

40:52.900 --> 40:54.000
Ugh.

40:57.734 --> 40:58.701
Hi.

40:58.768 --> 41:00.501
Hi.

41:02.801 --> 41:05.300
So, tell me,
how did it go?

41:05.367 --> 41:06.967
To be honest,
i'm not sure.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.900
They're gonna need
some more convincing.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.701
Even then, i don't know.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.100
Whatever happens...

41:13.167 --> 41:14.868
One of us will be happy,
i guess.

41:18.801 --> 41:20.967
Why can't you be with me
on this?

41:21.033 --> 41:25.234
Talking to you...
is like talking to spencer.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.434
You're both so focused
on one thing.

41:27.501 --> 41:28.801
It clouds everything else.

41:28.868 --> 41:30.601
It's a crazy way to live,
michael.

41:30.667 --> 41:32.768
<i>you know what?
i am like spencer.</i>

41:32.834 --> 41:34.401
We both see the world
a certain way,

41:34.467 --> 41:37.000
And we both have skills
to make it a better place.

41:37.067 --> 41:38.567
That's not a bad thing.

41:38.634 --> 41:40.834
I don't want to keep
ducking this,

41:40.900 --> 41:42.534
So let me
be straight with you.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.200
This job, what we just did,
saving american lives,

41:45.267 --> 41:48.801
This is the type of work
i was made for, fi.

41:48.868 --> 41:51.434
It's what my old job gave me
a chance to do every single day.

41:51.501 --> 41:54.801
So, no, getting back in
isn't just a way to survive,

41:54.868 --> 41:56.801
To protect
the people i love.

41:56.868 --> 41:58.567
<i>it's what i want.</i>

42:01.200 --> 42:03.768
And if you truly care
about me,

42:03.834 --> 42:07.967
You should damn well want for me
what i want for myself.

42:14.501 --> 42:16.401
If that's what you want...

42:18.134 --> 42:20.501
...i'll be with you.

42:20.567 --> 42:21.933
I'll be with you.

42:23.234 --> 42:25.067
