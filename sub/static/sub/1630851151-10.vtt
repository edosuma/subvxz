WEBVTT

00:13.035 --> 00:15.037
Everything can go
in the bedroom. Thank you.

00:18.874 --> 00:20.042
(door closes)

00:23.946 --> 00:25.715
(line ringing)

00:25.781 --> 00:27.817
(traffic whooshing past)

00:31.954 --> 00:33.989
(phone ringing)

00:37.727 --> 00:40.296
-Hi.
-MARCIA: I'm checked in.
It's room 3405,

00:40.330 --> 00:42.332
-you can come up now.
-Okay.

00:45.135 --> 00:47.303
Mom, how much
does this room cost?

00:47.337 --> 00:49.472
Don't worry about that.

00:49.505 --> 00:51.741
Just tell me, how did it all go?

00:51.741 --> 00:54.744
Most places don't want to do
a book deal with me,

00:54.744 --> 00:56.912
but there was one team
that seemed kind of interested,

00:56.979 --> 00:59.715
and they don't seem like
a tabloid, which is good.

00:59.749 --> 01:01.551
Did you get the feeling
that they wanted you

01:01.584 --> 01:03.153
to go into a lot of detail?

01:03.186 --> 01:04.654
They said it would be
my version of the story,

01:04.687 --> 01:07.056
however I feel comfortable
telling it.

01:07.089 --> 01:09.825
And they said if I want, I can
write it with Andrew Morton.

01:09.859 --> 01:11.927
Guy who wrote
Princess Diana's book with her.

01:11.927 --> 01:14.564
-Wow.
-That book was the...

01:14.597 --> 01:17.333
the thing that finally let
people see her side of it all.

01:20.670 --> 01:23.439
Mom, we need to pay
for these lawyers.

01:24.507 --> 01:25.675
I know.

01:26.676 --> 01:29.779
And maybe I'm naive, but...

01:29.845 --> 01:32.948
it could give me a chance
to show people who I really am.

01:33.015 --> 01:35.117
Finally.

01:35.185 --> 01:37.620
(indistinct chatter)

01:37.620 --> 01:41.123
WISENBERG:
At all. Seriously. I mean...

01:41.191 --> 01:43.926
Kavanaugh. Section two,
subsection four of the grounds,

01:43.959 --> 01:45.127
you put in,
"Wanting to go down on her,

01:45.195 --> 01:46.529
but she stops him"?

01:46.562 --> 01:48.298
-So?
-So, you're doing grounds
for impeachment.

01:48.364 --> 01:50.533
-Paul and I are doing
the full narrative.
-Right here.

01:50.566 --> 01:52.468
She stopped him
for a physical reason,

01:52.535 --> 01:54.370
Ms. Lewinsky did then perform
oral sex on him."

01:54.404 --> 01:55.971
Take it out of your part.

01:56.038 --> 01:58.274
Then my subsection four is just
"He fondled her bare breasts

01:58.308 --> 01:59.542
with his hands and mouth."

01:59.575 --> 02:00.810
-PAUL: Okay, what...
-The...

02:00.876 --> 02:02.144
Why would I only describe half
of what happened?

02:02.144 --> 02:04.547
That whole day goes
into his intent to arouse.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.449
Yes, that's why
it's in our section,

02:06.482 --> 02:08.551
-which comes before yours.
-You're assuming

02:08.584 --> 02:10.386
that they're gonna
be reading it in order.

02:10.420 --> 02:12.722
What does that even mean? What
other way is there to read it?

02:12.755 --> 02:13.956
You're just pissed
that I took Clinton

02:13.989 --> 02:15.225
jerking off into a sink
from you.

02:15.258 --> 02:17.827
Okay, why is that
even in the report?

02:17.827 --> 02:19.495
I mean, how does it
have anything

02:19.562 --> 02:22.632
to do with him touching her
with the intent to arouse?

02:22.665 --> 02:23.999
-Shut up, Mikey. Emmick
-You are such a commie.

02:23.999 --> 02:25.401
can't handle her bullshit.
-Hey.

02:25.435 --> 02:26.902
Just leave it all where it is.
We don't have time.

02:26.936 --> 02:28.638
We have to start printing now.

02:28.671 --> 02:30.940
Boys and girls, this is it.

02:40.916 --> 02:42.418
What have we got here?

02:42.452 --> 02:44.153
Great job, everybody.

02:44.186 --> 02:47.323
(chuckles)
Big day.

02:47.357 --> 02:49.359
All right. Oh.

02:49.359 --> 02:51.594
Here's the big guy.

02:51.627 --> 02:54.196
The leader.

02:54.264 --> 02:56.532
Everyone, if I may.

02:59.134 --> 03:01.337
The media has accused us

03:01.371 --> 03:05.107
of an unfair, partisan crusade,

03:05.140 --> 03:08.844
a witch hunt that would
inevitably come to nothing.

03:08.878 --> 03:12.282
And they tried
to kill your faith,

03:12.315 --> 03:15.184
but they he did not know
your fortitude.

03:15.217 --> 03:18.854
So, in prayerful, steady, quiet,

03:18.888 --> 03:21.123
you built this.

03:21.156 --> 03:23.225
I am proud of this report.

03:23.293 --> 03:27.797
It is thorough, bulletproof,
irrefutably true.

03:27.830 --> 03:31.233
It shows that no president
is above the law.

03:31.233 --> 03:33.235
That's good.
Thank you, sir.

03:35.070 --> 03:37.139
Hey. Must be
how the Democrats felt

03:37.172 --> 03:39.909
before they sacked Nixon, right?

03:39.975 --> 03:42.144
Uh, you know what? Uh...

03:42.177 --> 03:43.579
All right,
I'll meet you down there.

03:43.646 --> 03:45.648
I'll-I'll see you down there.
I'll be right back.

03:45.681 --> 03:46.916
-Hurry up!
-All right.

03:58.994 --> 04:00.763
(line ringing)

04:00.830 --> 04:02.732
(ringing)

04:02.765 --> 04:04.734
-Myers.
-Yeah, it's me.
Our report is done.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.669
I got a van ready to roll,
less than five minutes.

04:06.702 --> 04:08.771
-What?
-Yeah.

04:08.838 --> 04:12.241
Call New York. Tell them
to put Brokaw on a desk.

04:12.274 --> 04:14.276
Get me a camera crew
and a producer.

04:14.344 --> 04:15.511
I'm going to the Capitol.

04:15.545 --> 04:18.113
(phone ringing)

04:18.180 --> 04:20.616
(sighs)

04:20.616 --> 04:22.284
Hey. What's up?

04:22.284 --> 04:25.421
David, do you have a comment on
Ken Starr's report being done?

04:25.455 --> 04:27.623
-I hear it's on its way
to the Capitol.
-W-What, today?

04:27.690 --> 04:30.292
-Nope, now.
-Now?

04:30.292 --> 04:32.094
-Right no...

04:32.127 --> 04:34.096
-BETTY: Hello?
-Betty. It's David.

04:34.129 --> 04:35.865
Is the president in?

04:35.898 --> 04:37.600
No one on the Hill
got a heads-up?

04:37.633 --> 04:39.402
How is that even possible?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.809
MAN (over TV):
...and try to get
some answers for you.

04:46.809 --> 04:48.478
Again, it's, uh,
what is unfolding.

04:48.478 --> 04:51.814
Mr. President?
David Kendall.

04:56.318 --> 04:58.388
-David.
-I just got a call from NBC

04:58.421 --> 04:59.789
asking for comment.

04:59.822 --> 05:01.557
Ken Starr's report
is on its way.

05:01.591 --> 05:03.659
-To us?
-To the Capitol, sir.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.162
(indistinct chatter)

05:15.505 --> 05:19.509
Guys, can we get your help
down here?

05:19.509 --> 05:23.679
You can open up that up.
Open up the back. Come on.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.415
Take the red ones.

05:25.448 --> 05:27.316
I need the red ones
into the minivan.

05:27.349 --> 05:30.185
The rest go up to the committee.

05:38.027 --> 05:40.029
(phone rings)

05:41.030 --> 05:43.499
Hey, Dan.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.435
What?

05:47.369 --> 05:49.038
Monica, get in here.

05:49.104 --> 05:51.841
(TV playing indistinctly)

05:51.874 --> 05:54.009
REPORTER:
Newt Gingrich
and the sergeant at arms

05:54.043 --> 05:55.878
were only notified about
the arrival of the report

05:55.945 --> 05:58.514
a short time ago.

05:58.548 --> 06:00.516
Oh, my God.

06:00.550 --> 06:03.352
*

06:03.385 --> 06:05.354
What we're watching right now
is the Capitol Police...

06:05.387 --> 06:08.390
How fast can we get our hands
on that report?

06:08.458 --> 06:11.393
Ingraham might know.
She's dating Lindsey Graham now.

06:13.328 --> 06:15.164
Four years, Mike.

06:17.967 --> 06:21.070
Nothing worth doing
is easy, right? Huh?

06:21.136 --> 06:22.738
Come on.

06:30.913 --> 06:33.716
-What's in it?
-We still don't have a copy.

06:33.749 --> 06:34.917
When will we?

06:34.917 --> 06:37.152
Very soon, like everyone else.

06:37.186 --> 06:39.989
The hell does that mean?

06:40.022 --> 06:43.893
RUFF:
Congressional leadership decidd
to put it on the Internet.

06:43.926 --> 06:46.662
The complete report.

06:46.696 --> 06:48.764
*

06:55.370 --> 06:58.073
Here we go.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.609
(mouse clicks)

06:59.675 --> 07:01.343
BOB SCHIEFFER (over TV):
The seal will be broken

07:01.376 --> 07:03.112
by the sergeant at arms
of the House,

07:03.112 --> 07:06.281
and they will begin making
Xerox copies of this report.

07:06.348 --> 07:08.684
So, the followings things
you should know,

07:08.718 --> 07:11.120
that on the CBS website,
if you want to get the report

07:11.186 --> 07:14.957
during, uh, this afternoon,
this is our Internet address.

07:15.024 --> 07:17.359
Uh, we'll have
a special broadcast...

07:20.696 --> 07:22.865
...coming up
on this CBS station,

07:22.898 --> 07:26.301
we'll bring you the details,
uh, of the Starr Report

07:26.301 --> 07:28.103
as soon as we get them.

07:28.137 --> 07:29.605
There'll be complete coverage,
of course,

07:29.639 --> 07:31.473
on tonight's CBS Evening News.

07:31.473 --> 07:33.475
WOMAN:
Do you think we could get
a couple of copies over here?

07:33.475 --> 07:35.811
MAN:
I need it. I'm on in 30 seconds.

07:35.811 --> 07:37.279
-Now...
-WOMAN: Wait, what is it? What?

07:37.312 --> 07:38.380
Wait, what did it say?

07:38.413 --> 07:40.215
-Oh, my God.
-Holy shit.

07:40.249 --> 07:43.285
-Oh, my God.
-Page 174,
"He put a cigar in her..."

07:43.318 --> 07:44.887
-(Monica panting)
-Why don't we give you a second

07:44.920 --> 07:47.456
to take a deep breath
so you can scan that over?

07:47.489 --> 07:50.325
-Did you get it?
-Not yet.

07:50.325 --> 07:52.728
MARCIA:
Is it arriving?

07:52.762 --> 07:54.830
(phone rings)

07:54.830 --> 07:56.331
Hello?

07:56.331 --> 07:58.801
Oh, it's your dad.

07:58.834 --> 08:02.838
Um, no, no,
it's-it's just a white page.

08:02.838 --> 08:05.007
There's a-a little,
um, an hourglass,

08:05.007 --> 08:06.842
and it-it's just turning.

08:06.842 --> 08:09.011
-Uh, what does that mean?
-It's trying to load, Mom.

08:09.011 --> 08:11.313
Okay, well... Oh, well...

08:11.346 --> 08:13.015
He says that his nurses
are having trouble

08:13.015 --> 08:15.084
putting it
on their computers, too.

08:15.117 --> 08:17.987
Well, why-why don't you
just ask a resident?

08:18.020 --> 08:19.989
Wouldn't that help?

08:20.022 --> 08:21.691
-I got it. I got it.
-What does it say?

08:21.757 --> 08:23.826
Hold on, hold on.
I'm at the table of contents.

08:23.859 --> 08:26.261
Oh, my God, November 15.

08:26.295 --> 08:27.496
"Sexual encounter."

08:27.529 --> 08:29.865
Go to it. Go to it!

08:29.865 --> 08:31.333
This goes into
considerable detail,

08:31.366 --> 08:33.168
some of which I won't go into.

08:33.202 --> 08:35.170
Uh, let me just read
one passage...

08:35.204 --> 08:39.374
Oh, my God, Mom. You have
to tell Dad not to read this.

08:39.374 --> 08:42.712
Bernie, don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

08:44.379 --> 08:45.681
CONWAY:
He fucked her

08:45.715 --> 08:46.782
with a cigar.

08:46.816 --> 08:48.450
What?

08:48.483 --> 08:51.353
-Right here.
-I'm sure it doesn't say that.

08:51.386 --> 08:54.957
"The president inserted a cigar
into Miss Lewinsky's vagina,

08:54.990 --> 08:59.128
then put the cigar in his mouth
and said, 'It tastes good.'"

08:59.161 --> 09:01.196
-Am I high?
-No.

09:01.230 --> 09:02.632
Did I take LSD?

09:02.665 --> 09:04.133
No, this is real.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.803
This is a real report
to U.S. Congress.

09:07.837 --> 09:10.305
Ms. Lewinsky testified,
"When I was working there

09:10.339 --> 09:12.708
"in the White House,
we'd start in the back,

09:12.742 --> 09:14.243
"in or near his private study,

09:14.243 --> 09:16.478
"and we'd talk,
and that was where

09:16.511 --> 09:18.313
we were physically intimate."

09:18.347 --> 09:21.316
Aside from his family,
friends and staff,

09:21.350 --> 09:23.819
which I don't know exactly
which category that would be i.

09:23.853 --> 09:26.822
So, at one time
during this relationship,

09:26.856 --> 09:28.157
the president was
complaining, uh, that

09:28.190 --> 09:30.092
he was getting
bad treatment from Monica...

09:30.159 --> 09:31.326
-Oh, come on.
-(mouse clicks)

09:31.360 --> 09:32.594
Uh, here's another...

09:32.594 --> 09:33.996
-Come on.
-(rapid clicking)

09:34.029 --> 09:36.732
No, no, no, no, no, no!

09:36.766 --> 09:38.768
Goddamn it!

09:38.834 --> 09:41.436
CROWLEY:
According to Ms. Lewinsky, she
noticed stains on the garment

09:41.436 --> 09:43.739
the next time she took it
from her closet.

09:43.773 --> 09:45.775
From their location,
she surmised,

09:45.775 --> 09:47.943
in essence, that the stains--
I'm paraphrasing now--

09:47.943 --> 09:51.113
um, were in essence, the
president's, uh, bodily fluid.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.416
Wait, what? I don't understand
where any of this happened.

09:54.449 --> 09:56.451
Right by the Oval Office.

09:56.518 --> 09:58.453
Poor Monica.

09:58.453 --> 10:01.123
Why would she tell them
all this detail?

10:01.190 --> 10:03.125
During this time,
the president took a phone cal,

10:03.192 --> 10:05.627
so we moved into
another office where, uh,

10:05.695 --> 10:08.130
she allegedly performed
oral sex on the president.

10:08.197 --> 10:09.531
Uh, I think I ought to read

10:09.564 --> 10:11.300
some more of this.
I may go down a little...

10:11.366 --> 10:13.535
MAN:
Sir, the whole Internet
is down. We're doing everything

10:13.568 --> 10:15.304
we can to bring it back up.
I don't understand

10:15.370 --> 10:17.940
-why you're using this tone...
-No, I have this tone, sir,

10:17.973 --> 10:20.309
because I am paying you
to host a political news site,

10:20.309 --> 10:22.878
which you apparently can't keep
running, even in the middle

10:22.912 --> 10:25.981
of the biggest political
news story of our lives!

10:25.981 --> 10:28.150
Mr. Drudge, we can do a post
saying it's not updating

10:28.150 --> 10:29.819
-right now.
-No, I don't want you to post.

10:29.819 --> 10:31.954
I need to post!
I need to post!

10:31.987 --> 10:34.890
The government is falling.
Fix it!

10:34.924 --> 10:36.726
(phone clatters)

10:36.759 --> 10:39.228
STUDENT:
"The president zipped up
quickly and went out.

10:39.261 --> 10:41.330
"Ms. Lewinsky remembers laughing
because he walked out

10:41.396 --> 10:43.465
to his office
visibly aroused." Uh...

10:43.498 --> 10:46.068
-(mouse clicking)
-Wait, fuck. Hey, fuck,
it's not loading.

10:46.101 --> 10:48.337
-The servers are down.
-Try the Library
of Congress site.

10:48.337 --> 10:49.972
Uh, that's been crashed
for an hour.

10:50.005 --> 10:52.141
-Wait, Kim, do you have it?
-I loaded the file.

10:52.174 --> 10:54.143
Yeah, come on, come on.
Let's see.

10:54.176 --> 10:55.745
-Come on, come on.
I need to see.
-Shut up.

10:55.778 --> 10:58.180
Shut up, I'm reading.

10:58.180 --> 11:00.816
Huh, look: he ejaculated.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.017
-Ew.
-Oh, my God.

11:02.084 --> 11:03.853
Ken Starr wrote this?

11:03.853 --> 11:05.855
Ken Starr, who probably
conceived his children

11:05.921 --> 11:07.422
through a hole in the wall

11:07.456 --> 11:09.258
between his garage
and his prayer room?

11:09.291 --> 11:12.694
These chapter titles.
"Ms. Lewinsky's Frustrations"?

11:12.762 --> 11:15.497
Like Danielle Steel.
(short chuckle)

11:15.530 --> 11:19.201
Oh, hold on.
Okay, finally, on page 154.

11:19.201 --> 11:20.936
I'm-I'm looking
at a legal argument.

11:20.970 --> 11:23.038
Here we go:
"grounds for impeachment."

11:23.038 --> 11:25.040
It... No, it's just more sex.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.541
(sighs)
What were they doing?

11:26.541 --> 11:29.444
I don't know,
but it is spectacular.

11:30.445 --> 11:31.713
(chuckles)

11:53.335 --> 11:55.737
MAN:
Hey, I need those stats.
Do you have them?

11:55.737 --> 11:57.572
In the whole report,
the word "impeachment" appears

11:57.572 --> 12:00.142
15 times, "breasts" 62 times,

12:00.175 --> 12:02.644
"cigar" 23 times,
"semen" 19 times,

12:02.677 --> 12:04.646
"vagina," five times,

12:04.679 --> 12:07.249
"genital" or "genitalia"
64 times.

12:07.316 --> 12:09.751
"Love" 18 times.

12:09.819 --> 12:11.586
That's right, Tom,
the scene here at the Capitol

12:11.653 --> 12:13.588
is one of palpable shock.

12:13.655 --> 12:15.757
Page 18, it describes phone sex

12:15.825 --> 12:17.759
between the president
and Monica Lewinsky.

12:17.827 --> 12:19.661
This, according
to her testimony.

12:19.694 --> 12:22.998
Page 32, a form of a sex game
allegedly played

12:23.032 --> 12:25.167
by the president
and Monica Lewinsky.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.602
CONWAY:
She had orgasms
on three or four occasions

12:27.602 --> 12:28.938
when he touched her genitals.

12:29.004 --> 12:30.172
Once he covered her mouth

12:30.205 --> 12:32.441
to keep her quiet
as she orgasmed.

12:32.507 --> 12:34.109
I mean, Strom Thurmond
is reading this right now.

12:34.109 --> 12:36.011
-Yeah, with one hand.
-I need to take a shower.

12:36.045 --> 12:38.347
Yeah, I can't believe
the OIC did this.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.015
You know,
nobody's gonna read this

12:40.049 --> 12:42.417
a-and think about
his actual crimes.

12:42.451 --> 12:43.853
Okay, relax, Conway.

12:43.886 --> 12:45.855
Yes, Bill Clinton
is the most shameless

12:45.888 --> 12:48.523
coagulum of skin ever born
in a trailer park,

12:48.557 --> 12:50.292
but even he can't
withstand this.

12:50.359 --> 12:53.128
-You think he'll resign?
-It's too humiliating.

12:53.195 --> 12:54.763
He embarrassed the country.

12:54.796 --> 12:57.032
He embarrassed humanity.
He's done.

13:09.044 --> 13:11.480
It's...

13:11.480 --> 13:12.982
KENDALL:
It's hundreds

13:13.048 --> 13:15.650
-of pages of...
-I've read it.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.319
Mr. President, it's vile.

13:17.386 --> 13:19.621
But ultimately,
what they are arguing

13:19.654 --> 13:21.223
is possible perjury
in a minor lawsuit

13:21.256 --> 13:24.659
on a topic totally unrelated
to Paula Jones herself.

13:24.726 --> 13:27.997
That that is a crime
against the republic--

13:27.997 --> 13:30.499
y... no sane person
would find that impeachable.

13:30.565 --> 13:32.902
Have you met
Republican leadership?

13:32.935 --> 13:34.336
BLUMENTHAL:
You're right.

13:34.403 --> 13:35.837
I spoke to Schumer just now.

13:35.905 --> 13:38.140
The GOP is writing up
the articles.

13:38.173 --> 13:41.676
Of course they are.
They were always going to.

13:41.743 --> 13:43.178
Honestly, sir, I-I...

13:43.178 --> 13:45.514
I think that Starr
has made a huge mistake.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.350
This whole thing
is completely out of proportion.

13:48.350 --> 13:49.851
It's way too personal.

13:49.919 --> 13:51.520
That'll be our argument.

13:51.586 --> 13:54.623
Well, go make it.

13:57.792 --> 14:00.262
(door opens)

14:01.696 --> 14:03.198
Hillary.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.369
I haven't read it.

14:07.369 --> 14:10.172
I won't read it.

14:10.205 --> 14:12.474
But Chelsea has.

14:13.442 --> 14:15.377
(door closes)

14:17.379 --> 14:19.681
JON STEWART:
Listen, the truth
is on your side.

14:19.714 --> 14:22.351
This is impeachment,
So hang in there.

14:22.384 --> 14:24.353
Good luck, kid. Now...

14:24.386 --> 14:26.355
if it's not too much trouble,
back into me.

14:26.388 --> 14:28.057
(audience laughter)

14:28.123 --> 14:29.959
Yeah, no, slowly. Yeah.

14:29.992 --> 14:32.461
No, no, no, no. Oh.

14:32.494 --> 14:35.397
Yeah, baby. Is that a thong?

14:35.397 --> 14:37.832
-Shipoopi.
-(laughter)

14:54.849 --> 14:57.552
LINDA:
I'm just going to, uh,
Semmes, Bowen & Semmes.

14:57.586 --> 14:59.421
Sign in, please.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.266
Can I see photo ID?

15:18.173 --> 15:19.941
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

15:24.513 --> 15:27.249
-That's Linda Tripp.
-(laughs)

15:27.282 --> 15:29.284
(both laugh)

15:34.523 --> 15:36.458
(button clicking rapidly)

15:36.525 --> 15:38.593
(elevator bell chimes)

15:38.627 --> 15:40.195
ZACCAGNINI:
You doing okay?

15:40.229 --> 15:43.132
I've, uh, I've been sending
emails to Ken Bacon,

15:43.132 --> 15:46.268
asking to return to my duty
station at the Pentagon.

15:46.301 --> 15:48.370
-You have to stop
contacting him.
-I know he won't reply,

15:48.403 --> 15:51.473
but I had the idea to, uh,
create a paper trail.

15:51.473 --> 15:53.475
I-I understand
that you don't think it wise

15:53.475 --> 15:55.210
-to file suit against DoD...
-L-Linda, stop.

15:55.244 --> 15:57.646
T-That's enough, that's enough.

15:57.646 --> 15:59.048
We...
(clears throat)

15:59.081 --> 16:01.783
We have a serious problem
in Maryland.

16:01.816 --> 16:04.153
I heard from
the state prosecutor's office,

16:04.153 --> 16:06.988
and they are preparing
an indictment against you

16:06.988 --> 16:08.823
for the taping.

16:09.824 --> 16:11.060
What?

16:11.093 --> 16:13.062
T-That that's not possible.

16:13.095 --> 16:15.330
I have immunity
from prosecution.

16:15.330 --> 16:17.966
They're arguing you have
federal immunity and not state.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.834
That's not at all
what I was told.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.970
Uh, call Judge Starr.

16:22.003 --> 16:23.972
This area of the law
is-is a little complicated.

16:24.005 --> 16:25.474
It's not complicated.

16:25.507 --> 16:27.342
The Starr Report only exists

16:27.342 --> 16:29.844
because I called OIC one night
and offered access

16:29.911 --> 16:32.681
to my tapes in exchange
for full immunity.

16:32.681 --> 16:35.350
I made
the extraordinary decision

16:35.417 --> 16:37.919
to pick up that phone precisely

16:37.952 --> 16:39.821
so that this would
never, ever happen.

16:39.854 --> 16:41.256
You have to make them stop.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.758
Linda, Maryland
is a Democratic state.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.760
-(scoffs)
-And I don't know
how to put this nicely,

16:45.794 --> 16:49.030
but prosecuting you for the
tapings is a very popular idea.

16:49.098 --> 16:51.266
Well, that's horrifying,
but actually,

16:51.300 --> 16:53.168
it shouldn't matter
because I have immunity,

16:53.202 --> 16:54.669
Which I will argue
before a judge,

16:54.703 --> 16:57.839
but we have to prepare
for the possibility of a trial.

16:57.872 --> 16:59.874
And unfortunately,
given all the charged emotions

16:59.941 --> 17:01.876
around this case,

17:01.943 --> 17:04.879
Monica Lewinsky will be
a very persuasive witness.

17:06.881 --> 17:08.049
Monica?

17:08.049 --> 17:10.285
She would come
testify against you.

17:14.556 --> 17:16.558
That can't happen.

17:16.558 --> 17:19.027
That cannot happen.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.829
We'll do our best to fight it.

17:22.331 --> 17:25.467
Do you understand
what my life is like right now?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.902
Every day there is a new
investigation being launched

17:27.969 --> 17:29.871
against me by some arm
of the government.

17:29.904 --> 17:32.641
-It's just...
-I'm being locked out of my job.

17:32.674 --> 17:35.310
I can't go anywhere
without being sneered at.

17:35.344 --> 17:39.148
Every night, I-I go check
on all of my locks on my doors

17:39.181 --> 17:42.651
and then-then, I just lie there,
awake in bed, terrified,

17:42.684 --> 17:45.086
because people know
where I live.

17:46.655 --> 17:50.259
I tried to do the right thing.

17:50.259 --> 17:54.062
I trusted our institutions
to protect a person like me,

17:54.095 --> 17:57.266
but instead I've been abandoned
to an unceasing nightmare

17:57.332 --> 17:59.501
in which everyone on the planet
somehow agrees

17:59.534 --> 18:02.771
that in this whole,
god-awful national tragedy,

18:02.837 --> 18:04.939
I'm the villain.

18:06.708 --> 18:09.278
It doesn't make any sense.

18:11.280 --> 18:14.249
A group of leading feminists
held a press conference today

18:14.283 --> 18:16.585
to show their support
for President Clinton

18:16.618 --> 18:19.588
as impeachment charges
swell in the House.

18:19.621 --> 18:22.791
We are witnessing
a revenge campaign

18:22.857 --> 18:26.127
to hound President Clinton
out of office.

18:26.127 --> 18:30.632
PATRICIA IRELAND:
As feminist leaders,
we will not stand idly by

18:30.632 --> 18:35.204
while Congress,
made up of nearly 90% men,

18:35.237 --> 18:37.306
attempt to remove
the first president

18:37.372 --> 18:39.874
elected by women voters.

18:39.908 --> 18:42.544
Meanwhile, reports today that
the House Judiciary Committee

18:42.577 --> 18:44.879
will soon release the 37 tapes.

18:44.913 --> 18:48.983
It is 22 hours of information,
conversations secretly...

19:02.163 --> 19:03.332
Hey.

19:03.398 --> 19:06.835
I'm making some coffee
if you want some.

19:06.901 --> 19:10.004
-Sure.
-Ugh, I need to wake up.

19:10.071 --> 19:11.840
I have to talk
to my lawyers later.

19:15.844 --> 19:21.350
Um, I'm, uh, I'm gonna go
with Golden Delicious.

19:27.188 --> 19:29.090
Monica?

19:29.123 --> 19:31.526
I didn't read it.

19:43.272 --> 19:45.340
MAN:
Are you searching
for wisdom in your life?

19:45.374 --> 19:49.511
Hi, I'm Paula Jones.
That's right.

19:49.544 --> 19:53.782

Call 1-900-884-1221,

20:01.823 --> 20:05.960

Satisfaction guaranteed.

20:05.994 --> 20:07.629
(phone ringing)

20:07.662 --> 20:09.464
DELMER:
Paula?

20:09.498 --> 20:11.800
-(Paula sighs)
-(TV playing indistinctly)

20:11.833 --> 20:14.235
Preston, what are you doing,
honey?

20:14.303 --> 20:17.372
-Mama, c-can you watch him?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

20:17.406 --> 20:21.976
Hello, this is the Celebrity
Psychic Friends Network.

20:22.010 --> 20:25.146
This is Paula Jones.
What is your name?

20:25.179 --> 20:27.482
GINGER:
Um, it's Ginger.

20:27.516 --> 20:29.484
Oh, hello, Ginger.

20:29.518 --> 20:31.986
I'm-I'm so glad you called.

20:32.020 --> 20:35.824
Are you having to make
a big decision in,

20:35.857 --> 20:36.925
uh, in your life,

20:36.991 --> 20:41.095
or should I just tell you
what I'm sensing?

20:41.162 --> 20:43.432
-(laughs)
-Uh, Ginger,

20:43.432 --> 20:47.602
I am sensing that you are
at a crossroads in your life.

20:47.669 --> 20:49.604
Do you feel
that there is someone

20:49.604 --> 20:52.441
who is holding you back
from taking the right path?

20:52.441 --> 20:54.943
(woman and man laughing)

20:55.009 --> 20:56.845
Ginger?

20:56.878 --> 20:58.747
Ginger, have you been
drinking, girl?

20:58.780 --> 21:01.516
-Someone wants to talk to you.
-Shh! Shh!

21:01.550 --> 21:04.085
Oh, okay.

21:04.118 --> 21:06.755
MAN (Southern accent):
Hey, Paula, you seen
my saxophone?

21:06.788 --> 21:08.857
I need you to blow on it.
(laughs)

21:08.890 --> 21:11.225
(woman laughing)

21:13.462 --> 21:15.263
At least you're getting calls.

21:15.296 --> 21:18.467
If they hang up before
five minutes, I get nothing.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.268
What are we gonna do?

21:20.301 --> 21:22.203
I don't see why Steve
can't help more.

21:22.236 --> 21:24.806
Still doesn't have a job, Mommy.
He's got nothing to send.

21:24.806 --> 21:27.141
Well. Well, last night,
I got to thinking,

21:27.208 --> 21:29.978
can't you go and get your job
with the state again?

21:30.044 --> 21:31.646
-They know you.
-Mama, no one's gonna

21:31.646 --> 21:33.648
hire me there after everything.

21:33.648 --> 21:35.484
I can't even get a job
at the Pizza Hut on Center

21:35.484 --> 21:37.318
'cause they said
that I would distract

21:37.318 --> 21:38.820
the customers and the clientele.

21:38.887 --> 21:42.323
Honey, you can always stay here
as long as you need.

21:42.391 --> 21:44.826
Can't she?
I want you both here.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.495
Now, come on.

21:46.495 --> 21:48.497
Come out with us, baby.

21:48.497 --> 21:51.332
-It'll be fun. Okay.
-It's okay.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.334
All right.

21:53.334 --> 21:55.504
-Mom...
-Don't... Go do it.

21:55.504 --> 21:58.172
Don't let Grandma smash you.

21:58.172 --> 21:59.841
(door closes)

22:00.842 --> 22:02.343
(sighs): Oh, my God.

22:04.513 --> 22:06.515
*

22:19.260 --> 22:21.329
-CACHERIS: Monica.
-Plato, are you watching?

22:21.362 --> 22:22.997
They're about to release them.

22:23.031 --> 22:25.500
We've been through this.
We had no way to stop it.

22:25.534 --> 22:28.269
Yes, I know, I-I thought...

22:28.302 --> 22:30.705
I just thought that you could
just call Kenneth Starr, okay?

22:30.772 --> 22:32.541
And you could tell him that
I have to release a statement

22:32.541 --> 22:35.343
because I have to say
how sorry I am about all this,

22:35.376 --> 22:38.212
and that I'm-I'm sorry, Hillary,
and I'm sorry to Chelsea.

22:38.279 --> 22:41.349
-Okay? Please.
-Monica, you're under
a gag order.

22:41.382 --> 22:43.885
You do not understand
how bad these tapes are.

22:43.952 --> 22:45.353
Okay?
And this is the first time

22:45.386 --> 22:47.188
that the public's
gonna hear my voice. I...

22:47.221 --> 22:49.390
-I understand.
-I just want to say
two sentences.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.025
That's it.

22:51.059 --> 22:53.562
I know, but Starr
will never allow it.

22:53.628 --> 22:56.565
Not until after you testify.
I'm sorry.

23:03.404 --> 23:04.739
(sighs)

23:07.341 --> 23:10.078
-(knocking on door)
-Barb, I'm just gonna
stay in today.

23:10.078 --> 23:11.913
Hi.

23:11.913 --> 23:14.549
-Actually not Barb. (laughs)
-Oh, my God!

23:14.583 --> 23:16.250
How have you been?

23:16.250 --> 23:18.219
It's crazy, I never hear
anything about you.

23:18.252 --> 23:19.654
How are you here?

23:19.688 --> 23:22.256
I heard they might be playing
the tapes today,

23:22.256 --> 23:24.593
so I thought I'd get on a plane
and come distract you.

23:24.593 --> 23:26.661
Cat, that's...

23:26.695 --> 23:28.096
(tongue clicks)
Um...

23:29.764 --> 23:31.833
-Jesus Christ.
-It's just Estazolam.

23:31.866 --> 23:33.001
Don't worry,
I was gonna sleep through it.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.435
This isn't my first day
like today,

23:34.503 --> 23:36.270
-and I've learned to plan ahead.
-Oh.

23:36.337 --> 23:38.106
Well, I had
a different plan.

23:38.106 --> 23:40.108
What?

23:40.174 --> 23:42.844
ANCHOR:
Okay, I think we have
our first tape queued up

23:42.877 --> 23:45.113
and ready to go here.

23:45.113 --> 23:48.016
A conversation
between Monica Lewinsky

23:48.049 --> 23:50.619
and Linda Tripp
concerning various topics.

23:50.685 --> 23:51.953
Let's listen.

23:51.953 --> 23:53.622
LINDA:
Any news on the job front?

23:53.688 --> 23:55.524
MONICA:
Ugh. No, but I just
got back from the mall,

23:55.557 --> 23:58.593
and I bought you a mixtape
to kick-start your workout pla.

23:58.627 --> 24:01.596
I think you'll like it, 'cause
it's songs for your generation.

24:01.630 --> 24:04.032
-LINDA: What songs?
-MONICA: "Heard It
Through the Grapevine."

24:04.065 --> 24:06.701
-LINDA: Okay.
-MONICA: "Stop!
In the Name of Love."

24:06.735 --> 24:08.770
-LINDA: Okay.
-MONICA: * Who put the bomp *

24:08.803 --> 24:11.139
* In the bop
shoo bop shoo bop? *

24:11.139 --> 24:14.308
-Do Like any of those songs?
-LINDA: No, Monica. I don't.

24:14.375 --> 24:15.710
MONICA (voice-over):
Did you read it?

24:15.744 --> 24:17.612
Of course not.

24:17.646 --> 24:20.815
Well, that makes, uh, you
and my dad out of six billion.

24:20.882 --> 24:21.983
At least you helped
the whole world

24:22.050 --> 24:23.552
learn how to use the Internet.

24:23.585 --> 24:26.487
Not really how I wanted
to contribute to society.

24:27.488 --> 24:28.823
Okay.

24:28.890 --> 24:31.392
It's not all you'll do in life.

24:31.425 --> 24:34.295
Oh, really? What do you see
for me? I'm gonna...

24:34.328 --> 24:36.798
what, open a school
for troubled children, or...

24:36.831 --> 24:39.568
-Sure.
-Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky.

24:39.601 --> 24:41.469
-I'm gonna teach your kids now.
-Why not?

24:41.502 --> 24:43.805
Okay.
Hi, I'm Monica Lewinsky,

24:43.838 --> 24:45.674
and today we're gonna learn
about the great men

24:45.740 --> 24:48.176
that have served as President
of the United States.

24:48.242 --> 24:50.178
And who better to speak to that?

24:51.245 --> 24:52.681
-You're wrong.
-(laughs)

24:52.681 --> 24:55.183
(laughing):
That's not nice.

24:57.285 --> 25:01.322
-Oh, God, I haven't
laughed in a long time.
-Oh.

25:01.355 --> 25:04.859
Look... next year,
you'll be in New York.

25:04.859 --> 25:07.862
We'll be at
some mediocre brunch place,

25:07.862 --> 25:10.599
and you'll be telling me
about some funny date you had.

25:10.632 --> 25:13.101
Yeah, it's gonna
go really well for me.

25:13.134 --> 25:15.169
I just need to find
someone who's been in a...

25:15.203 --> 25:17.538
-a coma for a really long time.
-Stop.

25:17.538 --> 25:19.340
No, you don't get it.

25:19.373 --> 25:22.010
It's that
or it's a long line of guys

25:22.043 --> 25:24.045
that just want to brag
to their friends

25:24.045 --> 25:25.680
that they did everything
that's in the Starr Report.

25:25.714 --> 25:28.216
-You can weed those guys out.
-And be left with what--

25:28.216 --> 25:30.719
a decent person
who wants to start a family?

25:30.719 --> 25:32.687
Yes.

25:32.721 --> 25:35.123
Cat, you're looking at
the best-selling

25:35.156 --> 25:36.557
Halloween costume this year.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.893
-That's who you're
on hike with.
-I know.

25:40.061 --> 25:41.295
Came with a cigar.

25:41.329 --> 25:43.732
I know.

25:43.798 --> 25:45.834
Saw that.

25:47.836 --> 25:49.570
-I bought one for myself.
-What?

25:49.570 --> 25:51.472
CAT: (chuckles):
Oh, my God.

25:51.505 --> 25:53.908
Look at that. (laughs)

25:53.908 --> 25:55.309
Wow.

26:01.850 --> 26:04.252
What?

26:04.252 --> 26:06.655
-Nothing.
-Aw.

26:07.656 --> 26:10.091
Had to think about the tapes.

26:10.091 --> 26:12.426
I can't help it.
There're that bad.

26:12.426 --> 26:14.395
They put me in
a conference room,

26:14.428 --> 26:16.564
and I had to sit
and listen to each tape

26:16.597 --> 26:19.000
-and sign that it was me.
-What?

26:19.033 --> 26:20.434
I was so sad at that time,

26:20.434 --> 26:23.437
and she captured
every single second of it.

26:23.437 --> 26:26.007
When I listen to it back,
I mean, it's...

26:26.040 --> 26:28.609
it's so clear she knew
she was taping.

26:30.278 --> 26:34.015
In the moment,
I had no idea, and...

26:34.048 --> 26:35.784
God, the things you say
when you're not even thinking.

26:35.784 --> 26:38.286
I mean, the random shit
that comes out of your mouth

26:38.352 --> 26:40.855
when you're just-just talking,

26:40.889 --> 26:43.524
killing time on the phone
to a friend,

26:43.557 --> 26:46.194
and when I talk about him...

26:47.195 --> 26:49.463
...I-I clearly couldn't see
how bad it was at the time

26:49.530 --> 26:51.766
because I did not
recognize myself.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.368
I sound...

26:54.402 --> 26:58.372
so lost and-and obsessed
and desperate.

26:58.406 --> 27:00.975
Totally out of control.

27:01.976 --> 27:05.213
And now everyone
gets to listen to it.

27:05.246 --> 27:06.981
And watch it on TV.

27:10.819 --> 27:12.320
Hey.

27:13.822 --> 27:16.791
It's either moping on this hill,

27:16.825 --> 27:19.160
or making the 1:00
You've Got Mail.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.830
Meg.

27:21.830 --> 27:24.332
-Good answer.
-(laughs)

27:25.333 --> 27:27.001
MALE PUNDIT (on TV):
Well, I mean, it...
Look, it's fascinating.

27:27.001 --> 27:30.238
Linda Tripp in that
nasal tone, manipulating

27:30.271 --> 27:32.006
the higher-pitch Monica Lewinsy

27:32.006 --> 27:33.674
FEMALE PUNDIT:
Let me just say one thing.

27:33.674 --> 27:36.477
Nobody deserves Linda Tripp.

27:36.510 --> 27:38.479
You know, for the life of me,
I don't understand

27:38.512 --> 27:40.915
how you work with someone
every day,

27:40.949 --> 27:42.984
you look them in the eyes
as a friend,

27:43.017 --> 27:45.019
and then at night you go home
and hit the on button

27:45.086 --> 27:47.355
on your RadioShack
tape recorder.

27:47.355 --> 27:48.857
To me, you do that,

27:48.857 --> 27:51.359
you lose membership
in the human family.

27:53.461 --> 27:54.929
Hey.

27:57.031 --> 27:58.933
You all right?

27:58.967 --> 28:01.702
Yeah.
I am, actually.

28:04.205 --> 28:05.273
(door opens)

28:10.211 --> 28:12.280
(sighs)

28:30.731 --> 28:33.234
TALK SHOW HOST:
All right, so, uh,
in summation... (chuckles)

28:33.234 --> 28:36.537
What Lewinsky might find is
that the public is very fickle,

28:36.570 --> 28:39.808
that men in sex scandals
often get second chances,

28:39.841 --> 28:42.643
and that women rarely do.

28:42.676 --> 28:46.314
Well, can you imagine
your son coming home and sayin,

28:46.347 --> 28:48.917
"I'm going to marry
Monica Lewinsky"?

28:59.160 --> 29:01.162
Is the congressman in?

29:01.195 --> 29:04.098
-He's at a fundraiser.
-I need to show you something.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.768
I'm working on
the impeachment charges.

29:07.836 --> 29:09.103
I've been digging into
the appendices.

29:09.103 --> 29:11.840
My whole life is
Ken Starr's appendices.

29:11.873 --> 29:13.942
-Sounds fun.
-I kept hitting this footnote

29:14.008 --> 29:15.844
about one of
the Paula Jones witnesses.

29:15.877 --> 29:18.079
Jane Doe 5.

29:18.112 --> 29:21.015
She had some kind of messed-up
encounter with Clinton.

29:21.049 --> 29:23.017
-What do you mean, "messed-up"?
-That's just it.
It was confusing.

29:23.051 --> 29:25.954
And the source it pointed to
wasn't anywhere I can find.

29:25.954 --> 29:28.622
Then I realized--
it's in the vault.

29:30.791 --> 29:33.127
This is where they keep
all the sealed evidence.

29:33.127 --> 29:34.628
Shut that.

29:39.533 --> 29:41.602
Jane Doe 5 filed this affidavit
last year,

29:41.635 --> 29:43.704
saying she never had
any encounter with Bill Clinton.

29:45.473 --> 29:48.609
But here is what
she told the FBI this year

29:48.642 --> 29:51.079
when they came
to follow up on it.

29:53.747 --> 29:55.816
*

29:58.552 --> 30:00.121
Who knows about this?

30:00.154 --> 30:01.722
(door closes)

30:03.424 --> 30:04.658
(beep)

30:04.725 --> 30:06.494
Juanita,
my name is Richard Perry.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.229
I work with
Congressman Lindsey Graham.

30:08.262 --> 30:09.630
The congressman would
like to have

30:09.663 --> 30:11.665
an informal
phone conversation with you.

30:11.665 --> 30:15.803
Please give us a call back
at 202-555-7893.

30:15.836 --> 30:17.171
(beep)

30:17.238 --> 30:19.673
Hi, Mike Walker
with the National Enquirer.

30:19.673 --> 30:22.010
I've got a cash offer I would
like to talk to you about.

30:22.076 --> 30:26.314
Give me a buzz back
at 310-555-0122.

30:26.347 --> 30:27.348
(beep)

30:27.348 --> 30:30.318
Hi, Juanita, this is Lisa Myer.

30:30.351 --> 30:33.021
I'm a reporter with NBC News.

30:33.021 --> 30:35.423
I wonder if
you and I could talk.

30:37.091 --> 30:40.861
The date. Right.
Okay, all right.

30:40.861 --> 30:42.596
(clears throat)

30:42.630 --> 30:44.165
Where do I look
when I'm talking?

30:44.198 --> 30:47.335
To me, just like
a normal conversation.

30:47.368 --> 30:49.103
When will we know
when it'll air?

30:49.137 --> 30:50.939
NBC should decide soon.

30:50.972 --> 30:53.874
But don't worry, I won't
let it take you by surprise.

30:53.874 --> 30:56.277
But it'll be before it's
all over, the impeachment?

30:56.310 --> 30:59.380
I have every reason
to believe it will.

30:59.447 --> 31:01.382
Are you ready?

31:01.449 --> 31:03.384
(deep inhale, exhale)

31:05.153 --> 31:07.655
-Okay, we are rolling.
-(Myers clears throat)

31:19.000 --> 31:20.401
BLUMENTHAL:
If the impeachment vote
were today,

31:20.468 --> 31:23.804
it would be 204 yeas,
195 nays

31:23.837 --> 31:25.539
and 35 undecided.

31:25.573 --> 31:28.142
-Where is Shays?
-Undecided right now.

31:28.176 --> 31:29.877
Wh... I thought we had him.

31:29.910 --> 31:33.081
A lot of the moderates
are leaning no,

31:33.147 --> 31:34.915
-but they're getting pressure
from the right.
-(sighs)

31:34.983 --> 31:37.585
The whole goddamn party
is going insane.

31:37.651 --> 31:40.321
We-we just need to
keep giving them reasons

31:40.354 --> 31:43.257
-to stay in our tent.
-Yeah, I-I'm going crazy
doing nothing.

31:43.324 --> 31:45.159
I feel I should be working
the phones.

31:45.193 --> 31:46.594
Sir, you know you can't do that.

31:46.660 --> 31:50.931
-I-If that got out...
-I do... I have,
uh, one thought.

31:50.931 --> 31:53.267
Some of the undecideds
are in districts

31:53.334 --> 31:54.935
where the first lady
is pretty popular,

31:54.935 --> 31:56.670
and we thought that
if she were to make

31:56.704 --> 31:58.939
a few targeted calls,
it-it might help.

31:59.007 --> 32:02.776
Uh, people, they want
to hear from Hillary.

32:05.613 --> 32:08.916
-Maybe you could
talk to her staff.
-Sure.

32:08.949 --> 32:12.286
-Absolutely, Mr. President,
-Mr. President.

32:12.353 --> 32:14.122
(door opens)

32:15.623 --> 32:16.624
(door closes)

32:17.858 --> 32:20.628
Have you seen the polling?
Hillary's numbers are insane.

32:20.628 --> 32:22.696
God, if you had told me in 1992
she'd ever be this popular,

32:22.730 --> 32:25.133
I'd have thought
you were on crack.

32:27.201 --> 32:28.769
HUMA:
The Vogue shoot is next week.

32:28.802 --> 32:30.304
They want to use
The Roosevelt Room.

32:30.371 --> 32:32.773
Okay, whatever
they think is best.

32:32.806 --> 32:35.809
-(beep) -ASSISTANT: Ma'am,
Congressman Rangel.

32:39.313 --> 32:41.482
Hey, Charlie,
what can I do for you?

32:41.549 --> 32:45.286
Moynihan's making it official
next week: he's retiring.

32:45.319 --> 32:46.954
There's going to be
an open Senate seat

32:46.987 --> 32:48.722
in the great state of New York.

32:48.756 --> 32:50.658
The whole party here,
all of us--

32:50.658 --> 32:52.826
down to the girl
who gets the coffees--

32:52.893 --> 32:55.496
you're our first choice,
Hillary.

32:55.496 --> 32:57.331
What do you say?

33:01.835 --> 33:04.472
DELMA: She's good at it.
You ready?

33:04.505 --> 33:07.175
-Oh. Oh, bravo!
-(phone ringing)

33:07.241 --> 33:09.510
So good. (chuckles)

33:09.577 --> 33:11.345
Want to try another one? Okay.

33:11.345 --> 33:13.013
Keep on hitting the pool.

33:13.013 --> 33:14.348
Hello.

33:14.415 --> 33:16.650
Paula? It's Susan.

33:16.684 --> 33:19.420
(gasps) Oh, my gosh. Susie!

33:19.453 --> 33:21.021
I miss you.

33:21.089 --> 33:22.990
Um, I'm actually...

33:23.023 --> 33:25.693
-I'm coming out there soon.
-Yes, I know.

33:25.759 --> 33:28.696
I also heard who's
bringing you out and what for.

33:28.762 --> 33:30.598
(sighs)

33:30.631 --> 33:32.032
Paula?

33:33.634 --> 33:35.769
This is the worst thing
that you could possibly do.

33:35.803 --> 33:38.606
Many of our friends
are very distraught

33:38.639 --> 33:41.008
over your psychic hotline.

33:41.041 --> 33:43.277
-Oh, you know, that was just
me reading a script.
-No, no, no.

33:43.311 --> 33:46.013
It is against
our religion, Paula.

33:46.046 --> 33:47.615
It deals with the occult,

33:47.648 --> 33:48.849
but I defended you.

33:48.882 --> 33:50.518
I said, "It's not her,
it's a mistake.

33:50.551 --> 33:51.685
Let it go."

33:51.719 --> 33:53.187
But now this?

33:53.221 --> 33:55.223
This I cannot defend.

33:55.289 --> 33:58.192
-I won't.
-Well, you-you don't have to,

33:58.226 --> 34:00.461
because it is just, um,

34:00.494 --> 34:03.897
an interview
about my experience,

34:03.964 --> 34:06.134
um, you know, with the case.

34:06.167 --> 34:08.969
-(chuckles)
-It is Penthouse magazine.

34:09.002 --> 34:12.306
No, but-but they
said that, um...

34:12.340 --> 34:14.708
They said it was just
a few tasteful photos.

34:14.742 --> 34:16.410
You know, real tasteful.

34:16.477 --> 34:19.547
It is cowardly to lie
to yourself about what this is

34:19.580 --> 34:22.082
and what men
use this magazine for.

34:22.150 --> 34:23.651
Susie.

34:23.684 --> 34:26.554
I have legal problems,
tax problems,

34:26.587 --> 34:28.922
that I don't...
I don't even understand.

34:28.922 --> 34:31.592
Something about my legal fund
being set up all wrong.

34:31.592 --> 34:33.227
-And...
-No, no, no, no. Don't.

34:33.261 --> 34:36.664
Don't try to blame this
on the many generous people

34:36.697 --> 34:38.766
-who have helped you.
-Well, I'm not, I'm not,

34:38.766 --> 34:40.067
but nobody...

34:40.100 --> 34:42.836
nobody is around anymore,

34:42.870 --> 34:44.772
and, um...

34:44.838 --> 34:49.610
(chuckles) I can't get
a job here, so, um...

34:49.677 --> 34:52.613
So I don't...
I don't have a choice.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.782
Of course you have a choice.

34:54.848 --> 34:57.518
Now, you are going to hang up

34:57.551 --> 35:01.289
and call them and tell them
that you are backing out.

35:01.355 --> 35:03.291
I already signed it.

35:05.726 --> 35:07.761
I can't do that.

35:07.795 --> 35:09.563
Susie, I need the money.

35:11.064 --> 35:13.434
(line clicks)
-(dial tone)

35:13.467 --> 35:14.902
(scoffs)

35:17.905 --> 35:19.807
(scoffs)

35:37.491 --> 35:38.826
(door closes)

35:38.892 --> 35:40.093
Mrs. Clinton.

35:43.897 --> 35:46.066
Yeah, I pinch myself
to get to work

35:46.099 --> 35:48.669
-in all these beautiful houses.
-(chuckles)

35:50.404 --> 35:53.140
Let's get you up to Teresa.

35:53.173 --> 35:56.777
She takes you through the work.
Come on up.

36:01.949 --> 36:04.151
-(chuckles)
-I would like you
to sit on the sofa,

36:04.184 --> 36:05.253
-if you don't mind.
-Okay.

36:16.096 --> 36:17.431
(takes deep breath)

36:17.465 --> 36:18.766
WOMAN:
Your hair

36:18.799 --> 36:22.102
holds the sexy texture so well.

36:22.135 --> 36:23.771
(chuckles):
I know.

36:23.804 --> 36:25.172
Gosh, the past few years,

36:25.205 --> 36:28.709
people have been making me
wear it so flat, but...

36:28.776 --> 36:30.378
I like my hair happy,

36:30.378 --> 36:33.881
and I like to dress
pretty and attractive, and...

36:33.881 --> 36:35.849
I don't know
what's so wrong with that.

36:35.883 --> 36:38.018
Some people try
to make you feel bad

36:38.051 --> 36:40.854
-for looking good.
-Right? I know. (chuckles)

36:40.888 --> 36:44.558
-What do you think?
-Oh, I love it.

36:44.558 --> 36:46.960
Oh, you are so talented.
Thank you so much.

36:46.994 --> 36:50.298
-Gosh, I wish I could do that.
-(chuckles)

36:50.331 --> 36:51.865
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

36:51.899 --> 36:54.302
Just between us?

36:54.335 --> 36:57.070
When you were alone with
the President in that room...

36:57.070 --> 36:58.739
(chuckles)

36:58.739 --> 37:00.240
...you did it, didn't you?

37:00.308 --> 37:02.175
*

37:03.176 --> 37:04.845
(softly):
Thank you.

37:09.417 --> 37:11.218
(shutter clicks)

37:11.251 --> 37:14.322
-Is that what she's wearing?
-Yeah.

37:14.355 --> 37:16.990
All right, Paula.
Uh, just relax, relax.

37:17.024 --> 37:19.226
-Put your arms down.
That's good.
-(sighs): Okay.

37:19.259 --> 37:21.395
Good, just open this up
a little bit.

37:21.429 --> 37:23.997
-Uh, lean forward. Good.
-(shutter clicks)

37:24.031 --> 37:26.834
Uh, lean forward. Let me see
what that looks like.

37:26.867 --> 37:28.669
Okay, good.

37:42.783 --> 37:45.453
-Can you look right at me?
-Yeah.

37:47.287 --> 37:49.289
Perfect.

37:50.458 --> 37:51.959
Can you put your leg up
on that banister?

37:52.025 --> 37:53.961
-Okay.
-Yeah.

37:54.027 --> 37:56.063
-Now do you knee. Great.
-Okay.

37:57.130 --> 37:59.099
Okay, give me a profile.

37:59.132 --> 38:01.134
All right, we got it.
Let's do the nudes.

38:01.201 --> 38:03.471
Tony, let me talk to you
for a sec.

38:04.472 --> 38:07.140
-Go slay it.
-(inhales sharply) Okay.

38:07.140 --> 38:09.276
Here we go.

38:09.309 --> 38:12.380
-Having fun, Paula?
-Oh, so much fun. (chuckles)

38:12.413 --> 38:14.314
Uh, I'm gonna put you
right up there.

38:14.382 --> 38:16.717
-Okay.
-Oh, Paula, Paula.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.151
Take your top off.

38:20.153 --> 38:21.989
You agreed to the nudes.
Remember?

38:22.055 --> 38:25.158
Uh, right. Yes, um...

38:25.158 --> 38:27.661
Uh, we said they were gonna be
really tasteful, right?

38:27.661 --> 38:29.663
Of course they will be,
sweetheart.

38:29.663 --> 38:31.665
Now can I please see you
without your top on?

38:31.732 --> 38:33.801
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

38:33.834 --> 38:35.836
(chuckles nervously)

38:37.505 --> 38:39.172
All the way off.

38:39.172 --> 38:41.475
(photographer chuckles)

38:41.509 --> 38:44.244
Great. Good.

38:44.277 --> 38:45.579
Bottoms, too.

38:47.848 --> 38:51.351
-(clears throat)
-That's great. That's good.

38:52.352 --> 38:55.155
-(shutter clicking)
-Good, let me see you smile.

38:55.188 --> 38:56.424
(shutter clicks)

39:07.868 --> 39:09.369
(door opens)

39:13.874 --> 39:15.776
(door closes)

39:19.713 --> 39:22.349
Podesta says
we just lost Castle.

39:22.382 --> 39:26.687
Nine are going with him,
and now Shays is leaning yes.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.221
The fuck is going on?

39:29.322 --> 39:32.893
Do you know a woman
named Juanita Broderick?

39:34.995 --> 39:37.197
-She's a...
-I know who she is.

39:37.230 --> 39:39.232
She was a campaign supporter
in the '70s.

39:39.232 --> 39:40.534
Why are you asking?

39:40.568 --> 39:43.537
She's the reason
we're losing the votes.

39:43.571 --> 39:45.338
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

39:46.674 --> 39:48.476
You know, the lunatic right
in Little Rock

39:48.509 --> 39:50.978
tried to start a rumor
about me and her years ago.

39:51.011 --> 39:53.313
She said many times
it isn't true.

39:53.346 --> 39:55.082
She said it under oath.

39:55.082 --> 39:56.884
She even came out this year
and said nothing happened

39:56.917 --> 39:59.086
-in an affidavit.
-Well, that's the problem.

39:59.086 --> 40:00.888
Apparently,
she told Starr's agents

40:00.921 --> 40:03.491
that affidavit was a lie.

40:03.524 --> 40:05.993
Starr put the FBI 302
in with the sealed evidence

40:06.026 --> 40:07.427
that got sent to the Hill.

40:07.495 --> 40:10.898
-What does it say? Be specific.
-We don't have access,

40:10.931 --> 40:13.934
but I have heard from
several people

40:14.001 --> 40:15.235
that it says

40:15.268 --> 40:16.937
that you assaulted her.

40:19.707 --> 40:21.609
She's fucking lying.

40:30.851 --> 40:32.452
You know, they take these women

40:32.452 --> 40:34.522
and they hound 'em
and they scare 'em.

40:34.555 --> 40:36.123
20 years
they've been working on her

40:36.123 --> 40:37.290
until she finally broke.

40:37.357 --> 40:39.292
It's fucking insane.

40:39.359 --> 40:42.763
And fucking Starr takes
his little poison pill

40:42.796 --> 40:44.464
and puts it in his little box.

40:44.532 --> 40:46.199
He knows what he's doing.

40:46.233 --> 40:49.036
I can't fight a charge
I can't even see.

40:49.069 --> 40:51.271
You know, they-they
create a lie about me

40:51.304 --> 40:52.973
and another lie
and another lie,

40:53.040 --> 40:55.208
and I can't...
I can't even get the truth out,

40:55.242 --> 40:56.810
because if I say anything

40:56.877 --> 40:59.613
then i-it just brings it
more attention.

40:59.647 --> 41:01.882
But when they spread
something like this,

41:01.915 --> 41:05.452
you know, once-once it gets out,
there's nothing you can do.

41:05.485 --> 41:07.387
It never goes away.

41:07.420 --> 41:08.989
It's a lie.

41:08.989 --> 41:11.892
It's another fucking lie.

41:13.326 --> 41:16.129
It's... it's not even a new one.

41:16.163 --> 41:18.999
Well, I know, sir,
but I got to tell you,

41:19.066 --> 41:22.335
Sid says that she is doing
a sit-down with Dateline.

41:24.938 --> 41:27.074
-When?
-We don't know.

41:27.107 --> 41:30.077
But no matter what,
it is tipping the undecideds

41:30.110 --> 41:32.680
to yes on impeachment.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.748
*

41:36.584 --> 41:38.619
(quiet chatter)

41:43.356 --> 41:44.925
MALE REPORTER:
Holy crap, she's here.

41:44.958 --> 41:46.426
-(laughter)
-I can't believe
she would show her face.

41:46.459 --> 41:48.596
(murmuring, laughter)

41:55.302 --> 41:56.770
Ah!

41:56.804 --> 41:58.538
(sighs)

42:01.875 --> 42:04.044
There's a broad
who could use a goddamn drink.

42:04.044 --> 42:05.545
-(chuckles)
-Hi.

42:05.545 --> 42:07.047
All right, come on,
let's get sauced.

42:07.047 --> 42:08.348
Oh... (chuckles)

42:08.381 --> 42:09.717
LUCIANNE:
So, tell me,

42:09.717 --> 42:13.386
what's it like
to be incredibly notorious?

42:13.453 --> 42:15.555
Well...

42:15.623 --> 42:17.024
(sighs)

42:17.057 --> 42:19.793
The White House and Pentagon
have, uh, deployed

42:19.827 --> 42:21.228
a multipronged strategy

42:21.294 --> 42:24.064
to destroy my career
and my reputation.

42:24.064 --> 42:27.567
And now the state of Maryland
is-is pursuing

42:27.567 --> 42:29.803
an extrajudicial
political prosecution

42:29.837 --> 42:31.805
-against me.
-Jesus.

42:31.839 --> 42:33.306
Clearly, Mrs. Clinton
has made a few calls,

42:33.340 --> 42:34.975
but you know how it is.

42:35.008 --> 42:36.810
As long as there's
no curiously-timed Mack truck

42:36.844 --> 42:39.412
in my future,
I'll consider myself lucky.

42:39.412 --> 42:41.982
Well, the upside
to being cast as a black cat

42:42.015 --> 42:44.217
in this fiasco is that
you're too famous

42:44.251 --> 42:45.819
to be on their kill list.

42:45.853 --> 42:47.821
(scoffs)

42:47.855 --> 42:49.589
Let's hope so.

42:49.657 --> 42:52.826
Listen, I wanted you
to hear this for me first.

42:52.860 --> 42:54.494
Monica's doing a book.

42:54.527 --> 42:56.764
St. Martin's Press, half a mil.

42:56.764 --> 42:59.432
That got Andrew Morton
to write it with her,

42:59.432 --> 43:01.735
like he did for Lady Di.

43:01.769 --> 43:04.437
That book was a smash.

43:04.504 --> 43:05.906
Diana?

43:05.939 --> 43:07.440
Yeah.

43:07.507 --> 43:09.943
-It'll be huge.
-Princess Diana.

43:09.943 --> 43:13.180
You dong the president,
you get the rewards.

43:13.213 --> 43:15.949
Everyone wants to hear
from Monica. (laughs)

43:17.685 --> 43:19.252
(scoffs)

43:19.286 --> 43:20.620
Well...

43:22.522 --> 43:25.859
She finally has the attention
she has always craved.

43:26.860 --> 43:29.129
I bet she is
absolutely loving this.

43:30.297 --> 43:31.965
Look, I can make a few calls,

43:32.032 --> 43:35.135
see if one of the small
conservative presses might bite,

43:35.202 --> 43:37.304
but the truth is...

43:37.370 --> 43:40.808
the truth is the Starr Report's
already put all the goods out

43:40.874 --> 43:42.976
on the avenue,
the market's gone soft,

43:43.043 --> 43:44.044
and with Monica...

43:44.077 --> 43:46.146
This was never
about a book for me.

43:48.215 --> 43:49.750
All right.

43:52.820 --> 43:55.723
But you can't say
we didn't have fun.

43:55.756 --> 43:57.657
(Linda scoffs)

43:57.657 --> 44:01.161
Mmm. God, I'll miss the Clintons
when they go.

44:01.161 --> 44:02.329
(scoffs)

44:02.329 --> 44:04.664
They were great for books.

44:05.999 --> 44:08.335
Come on,
let's go make the rounds.

44:08.335 --> 44:10.337
*

44:15.508 --> 44:17.344
(woman laughing)

44:17.344 --> 44:19.312
No, all right, well,
then I'll take care of it.

44:19.346 --> 44:20.647
-I mean, we just need to...
-(overlapping chatter)

44:20.680 --> 44:23.350
Got to drop our stuff...

44:23.416 --> 44:26.253
-Yes, please, please. Can we?
-Yes.

44:26.286 --> 44:29.522
Excuse me. Do you know, uh,
is the restaurant here any good?

44:29.522 --> 44:32.159
Oh, uh, yes, very classic.

44:32.192 --> 44:34.361
-Their Cobb salad is famous.
-(elevator bell dings)

44:39.199 --> 44:41.134
Are you Linda Tripp?

44:42.102 --> 44:44.004
You did a hideous thing.

44:44.037 --> 44:47.340
(laughter)

44:47.374 --> 44:49.810
-MAN: Well said.
-WOMAN: What?

44:56.383 --> 44:59.019
What's going on?

44:59.052 --> 45:01.554
I'm just planning my day
for tomorrow.

45:01.621 --> 45:04.724
NSA briefing in the morning.

45:04.724 --> 45:07.527
Lunch with Podesta.

45:07.560 --> 45:10.297
Impeached in the afternoon.

45:10.330 --> 45:12.299
Then I'll face the country.

45:13.333 --> 45:16.904
History will savage them, Bill.

45:16.904 --> 45:18.205
That's fine.

45:18.238 --> 45:20.373
I just don't know
what we do right now.

45:20.407 --> 45:22.810
Same as always:
we keep fighting.

45:22.843 --> 45:26.246
We're not done.
Not even close.

45:48.701 --> 45:50.770
*

46:15.896 --> 46:18.131
ANNOUNCER:
Here is Dan Rather.

46:18.198 --> 46:20.100
Good day,
from the nation's capital,

46:20.133 --> 46:21.768
on a solemn and pivotal day

46:21.801 --> 46:23.871
for the president, for
the Congress and the country.

46:28.208 --> 46:30.143
(elevator bell dings)

46:38.418 --> 46:41.288
MALE REPORTER:
They're voting on Article I.

46:41.321 --> 46:45.492
Charging the president with
perjury before a grand jury.

46:45.492 --> 46:49.796
I think what you may be seeing
is Democrats leaving the chambr

46:49.829 --> 46:53.300
to go out to the front steps
of the House.

46:53.333 --> 46:56.937
They intend to stay out
for just a short period of tim.

47:01.008 --> 47:04.844
On this vote,
the yeas are 228,

47:04.844 --> 47:07.014
the nays are 206.

47:07.014 --> 47:09.816
-Article I is adopted.
-(gavel bangs)

47:09.849 --> 47:12.519
-(laughter)
-MALE REPORTER: This is
how history will change--

47:12.585 --> 47:14.988
with the sound of laughter
in the background.

47:15.022 --> 47:17.490
William Jefferson Clinton
has been impeached

47:17.524 --> 47:18.691
by the House of Representatives

47:18.691 --> 47:20.327
on at least one article.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.263
This guarantees
that this will go to the Senat.

47:23.296 --> 47:24.864
(TV clicks off)

47:30.037 --> 47:31.538
Want to hear a joke?

47:34.607 --> 47:35.675
There's this guy

47:35.708 --> 47:37.877
caught on a cliff in a storm.

47:39.046 --> 47:41.048
Wind and rain raging.

47:42.049 --> 47:44.517
He's trying
to hold on to a branch.

47:44.551 --> 47:46.853
It's about
to slip out of his hands.

47:46.886 --> 47:48.555
He's about to fall.

47:50.057 --> 47:52.725
He looks up and he says,

47:52.792 --> 47:54.661
"Why me, God?"

47:56.129 --> 47:58.798
And God looks down on him
and says...

48:02.135 --> 48:04.171
..."I just don't like you."

48:24.324 --> 48:26.359
*

48:46.546 --> 48:48.615
*

49:23.150 --> 49:24.817
Matt Drudge here, Fox News,

49:24.817 --> 49:26.286
somewhere in midtown Manhattan.

49:26.319 --> 49:28.821
Tonight's headlines:
NBC bigwigs at war

49:28.821 --> 49:30.990
over their Juanita Broaddrick
interview.

49:31.058 --> 49:33.326
Monica back in D.C. to testify

49:33.326 --> 49:36.229
and Paula Jones in Penthouse.

49:36.263 --> 49:38.131
Joining me here to talk
about all this at the desk

49:38.165 --> 49:41.334
is Ann Coulter, author
of High Crimes and Misdemeano.

49:41.401 --> 49:43.170
Ann, what's your take
on all this?

49:43.236 --> 49:45.338
Um, let me just say,
Juanita Broaddrick

49:45.405 --> 49:48.007
is very credible,
but even worse than that

49:48.007 --> 49:49.742
is Paula Jones.

49:49.776 --> 49:52.011
I'm deeply, pathetically

49:52.011 --> 49:54.514
despondent over what she's done.

49:54.514 --> 49:57.150
I mean, she was our Rosa Parks.

49:57.184 --> 50:00.653
She was the hero in
"a David and Goliath" conflict.

50:00.687 --> 50:03.156
She used to have dignity

50:03.190 --> 50:05.325
and nobility
and tremendous courage.

50:05.358 --> 50:06.626
And now?

50:07.627 --> 50:10.630
Turns out she's just the trailer
park trash they said she was.

50:12.765 --> 50:13.833
(knocking)

50:13.866 --> 50:16.103
-Oh.
-DRUDGE: Did you like my set?

50:16.136 --> 50:18.371
I told them Dragnet
meets Star Trek.

50:18.438 --> 50:21.508
It's very fun.
It's so unusual.

50:21.541 --> 50:23.510
How do you think I'm doing?

50:23.543 --> 50:25.712
You're so good
at sitting still out there.

50:25.778 --> 50:27.880
Oh, takes practice.

50:27.947 --> 50:29.682
You'll do it.

50:29.716 --> 50:31.184
That's what Roger Ailes
just said.

50:31.218 --> 50:32.619
It takes time.

50:32.652 --> 50:34.287
When does this air again?

50:34.321 --> 50:36.123
Saturday night at 9:00.

50:36.156 --> 50:38.125
Oh, well, that's a great time
for a news show.

50:38.158 --> 50:39.892
-(laughs)
-(chuckles) God.

50:39.959 --> 50:42.129
what about you? Would you ever
want to do your own show?

50:42.162 --> 50:44.197
(sighs)
I was told

50:44.231 --> 50:46.466
I would get
too many FCC violations.

50:46.499 --> 50:48.735
Oh, well, I'm not
crying for you,

50:48.801 --> 50:51.404
-Ms. New York Times Best Seller.
-Oh.

50:51.471 --> 50:54.574
You know, I'm doing
a segment on this moment.

50:54.641 --> 50:56.209
What do you mean?

50:56.243 --> 50:57.744
Our moment.

50:59.346 --> 51:01.914
It's the dawn
of a new conservative era.

51:01.981 --> 51:03.983
Can't argue,
we're all in demand.

51:04.016 --> 51:06.085
Even Ingraham.

51:07.354 --> 51:09.389
But, Drudge,
the sitting president

51:09.422 --> 51:11.824
of the United States is a felon.

51:11.858 --> 51:14.494
We exposed him-- you, me,

51:14.527 --> 51:16.829
Conway... Starr exposed

51:16.863 --> 51:18.998
more disgusting detail
than we even knew existed.

51:19.031 --> 51:21.601
But if he ran

51:21.601 --> 51:24.337
for a third term today,
he'd win.

51:24.371 --> 51:26.939
Hillary, a walking void

51:27.006 --> 51:29.342
of charisma,
a sentient bag of ice chips

51:29.376 --> 51:31.278
is-is so popular right now.

51:31.344 --> 51:33.446
She's going to be in the Senate.

51:33.513 --> 51:36.783
We showed this country exactly
who they are and they said,

51:36.849 --> 51:39.186
"Yes, please,
could we have some more?"

51:39.219 --> 51:42.121
They're who America
want in power.

51:42.121 --> 51:43.523
Not us.

51:43.556 --> 51:45.558
Oh, I don't know
if it's all that bleak.

51:46.559 --> 51:48.195
The head of our justice system
lied under oath

51:48.228 --> 51:49.862
and got off scot-free.

51:49.896 --> 51:52.131
We have no rule of law anymore.

51:52.199 --> 51:54.701
But sure, Drudge, don't worry,

51:54.734 --> 51:56.603
our side is going to run

51:56.636 --> 51:59.138
the stupidest Bush
for president.

51:59.206 --> 52:02.141
Oh, and the impotent GOP
is calling

52:02.209 --> 52:05.645
on our secret weapon
for the thousandth time.

52:05.712 --> 52:07.814
DRUDGE:
I cannot believe they're
calling her in again.

52:07.814 --> 52:09.482
She must hate it.

52:09.482 --> 52:11.451
Oh, she'll be fine.

52:11.484 --> 52:13.152
If there's one thing
we know she loves,

52:13.152 --> 52:15.154
it's being in a room
with old men.

52:15.222 --> 52:16.823
(both laugh)

52:18.658 --> 52:20.159
It's true.

52:20.227 --> 52:22.995
(crowd shouting, clamoring)

52:27.567 --> 52:29.736
It'll be three Republican
members of congress.

52:29.769 --> 52:31.404
They don't have enough votes
to convict him,

52:31.438 --> 52:33.240
so they're gonna try
to rattle you.

52:33.273 --> 52:35.174
-Have you say
something different than...
-This is my 22nd time

52:35.174 --> 52:37.176
being questioned about this.
I got it.

52:38.177 --> 52:40.079
You signed an affidavit
stating you never

52:40.112 --> 52:41.981
had sexual relations
with the president.

52:42.014 --> 52:43.850
Was that untrue?

52:43.916 --> 52:46.686
Yes, it was, as I stated
in my prior testimony.

52:46.753 --> 52:49.689
So do you believe it was
in President Clinton's

52:49.756 --> 52:52.592
best interest for you to lie
on that affidavit?

52:53.793 --> 52:55.695
I don't really feel comfortable
speaking what he believed

52:55.762 --> 52:57.797
to be in his best interest.

52:58.865 --> 53:01.200
Well, it certainly wasn't
in your own best interest.

53:01.268 --> 53:03.336
No, actually it was.

53:03.370 --> 53:06.673
Why w... why would it be
in your best interest

53:06.706 --> 53:08.708
to file a false affidavit?

53:09.976 --> 53:12.279
'Cause I was trying to avoid
testifying in public

53:12.312 --> 53:15.214
about a personal relationship
like I'm doing right now.

53:15.214 --> 53:16.849
Can we move along here?

53:16.883 --> 53:19.218
I'm paying my lawyers umpteen
thousand dollars an hour.

53:19.218 --> 53:21.521
It's coming out of my pocket.

53:21.554 --> 53:24.391
Please, can we
get this over with?

53:26.893 --> 53:29.228
Miss Lewinsky, Miss Lewinsky.

53:30.229 --> 53:32.399
The, uh, president
wanted us to relay

53:32.465 --> 53:34.901
a message to you on his behalf.

53:34.967 --> 53:37.637
We just wanted to express
how sorry he is

53:37.670 --> 53:39.806
for everything
that you've been through.

53:43.009 --> 53:44.911
Is that it?

53:44.977 --> 53:48.815
Uh, well, Charles and I
are also very sorry

53:48.848 --> 53:50.650
for-for everything
that you've experienced.

53:50.683 --> 53:52.752
CHARLES:
Yes.

53:52.752 --> 53:54.321
Indeed.

53:54.354 --> 53:56.923
Thank you.

53:58.257 --> 54:00.092
Fellas.

54:00.092 --> 54:02.061
An acquittal is
virtually assured

54:02.094 --> 54:03.930
on both of the two counts...

54:06.098 --> 54:08.234
(exhales)

54:08.267 --> 54:10.269
(Dan Rather speaking
indistinctly on TV)

54:16.175 --> 54:17.844
(register beeping)

54:19.379 --> 54:21.448
(register clanging)

54:33.125 --> 54:35.061
(chuckles)

54:48.375 --> 54:50.309
So there's no confusion,
acquittal for the president

54:50.377 --> 54:52.779
on both of the charges
now seemed assured.

54:52.812 --> 54:55.482
The first charge, perjury,

54:55.482 --> 54:59.151
seems destined not to get
even a simple majority.

55:01.721 --> 55:03.322
Can't believe this.
(sniffles)

55:03.390 --> 55:04.624
It's so fucking gross.

55:04.657 --> 55:05.992
Language.

55:05.992 --> 55:07.326
ALLISON: (scoffs)
It doesn't make any sense.

55:07.394 --> 55:09.429
It was always
gonna end this way.

55:11.831 --> 55:13.966
You said that he was gonna
have to resign.

55:14.000 --> 55:16.302
Well, I got caught up
in the dramatics

55:16.335 --> 55:18.505
-of the whole scenario.
-Okay, so that's it, then?

55:18.505 --> 55:21.307
-The lesson here is
that you should've just lied.
-No.

55:21.340 --> 55:22.909
That's not the lesson.

55:24.511 --> 55:26.513
(sighs)

55:27.847 --> 55:29.516
You know why

55:29.516 --> 55:31.684
I never told you
about my father?

55:32.685 --> 55:35.488
Because I didn't want to let
my child know how completely

55:35.522 --> 55:39.191
fantastic life tends
to turn out for liars.

55:40.960 --> 55:42.929
Of course, as a kid, I didn't

55:42.962 --> 55:44.764
realize what he was.

55:44.797 --> 55:47.099
I worshipped him.

55:47.133 --> 55:49.869
He was an incredibly strict man.

55:49.936 --> 55:52.439
He was sort of a... avatar

55:52.472 --> 55:55.107
of moral certitude.

55:58.377 --> 56:00.880
And then one day,
when I was a teenager,

56:00.880 --> 56:03.282
he announced he was...

56:03.315 --> 56:05.051
Walking out of our family.

56:05.051 --> 56:06.886
To be with a woman

56:06.886 --> 56:08.955
he met at the school.

56:08.988 --> 56:11.057
I mean, I begged him to stay.

56:12.492 --> 56:14.827
I knew it was pathetic.

56:16.228 --> 56:18.164
I offered him my room.

56:20.667 --> 56:22.134
He didn't care.

56:22.168 --> 56:24.136
He got in his car
and drove away.

56:24.170 --> 56:26.205
But...

56:26.238 --> 56:28.407
that wasn't the worst of it.
Because after he left,

56:28.407 --> 56:30.977
the truth came out.

56:31.010 --> 56:34.146
For years-- my entire life--

56:34.180 --> 56:36.248
he'd been having affairs
with women

56:36.248 --> 56:38.250
all over Morris County.

56:40.252 --> 56:42.722
And everyone had known.

56:42.755 --> 56:46.025
The kids at school,
all the neighbors, everyone.

56:47.193 --> 56:50.196
It was so humiliating.
And my mother...

56:51.430 --> 56:52.932
She barely survived that.

56:55.001 --> 56:56.435
Why didn't anyone tell her?

56:56.435 --> 56:59.105
Because they liked him.

57:01.373 --> 57:04.443
They liked him
more than her or me.

57:05.712 --> 57:07.113
He was a cheater.

57:07.113 --> 57:09.181
He was a liar.

57:09.215 --> 57:12.018
And nobody held it against him.

57:13.185 --> 57:15.221
That's the truth.

57:16.523 --> 57:18.791
Men like that.

57:18.858 --> 57:22.128
Men like Bill Clinton--
they ruin lives.

57:23.696 --> 57:25.698
And they get away with it.

57:27.466 --> 57:29.468
They just do.

57:48.655 --> 57:50.389
God.

57:51.924 --> 57:53.626
"Congratulations,
you've been accepted

57:53.660 --> 57:55.662
into the White House
internship program."

57:55.662 --> 57:57.997
-Oh, honey.
-I'm fine.

58:00.432 --> 58:02.468
I honestly cannot stop
thinking about that apology

58:02.501 --> 58:04.671
his lawyer said was from him.

58:04.671 --> 58:07.574
He's sorry for all
that you've been through? I...

58:07.607 --> 58:09.141
That's something
that you say to a coworker

58:09.175 --> 58:10.309
who's having a tough month,

58:10.342 --> 58:11.678
one that you're
not even that close to.

58:12.679 --> 58:15.414
I would have done anything
to protect him.

58:15.447 --> 58:17.016
I did.

58:18.284 --> 58:20.186
Because that's
how much he meant to me.

58:20.252 --> 58:23.856
But him?
Every single chance

58:23.856 --> 58:26.993
that he had to help me,
he-he chose to do nothing.

58:27.026 --> 58:28.995
When I got that subpoena, he...

58:29.028 --> 58:31.363
he could have said,
"Monica, don't lie.

58:31.363 --> 58:34.867
Don't break the law.
Don't do that for me."

58:36.869 --> 58:39.005
And that-and that first week,

58:39.038 --> 58:41.507
when this all came out
and everyone was saying

58:41.540 --> 58:44.043
that I was a stalker
and that I was making it all up,

58:44.043 --> 58:46.178
he just...

58:46.212 --> 58:50.717
he just sat there
a-and let them.

58:52.118 --> 58:55.054
He could have stopped this
at any time.

58:58.457 --> 59:01.360
She is known as Jane Doe #5,

59:01.393 --> 59:04.130
but tonight, we can reveal her

59:04.163 --> 59:07.634
as 56-year-old
Juanita Broaddrick.

59:07.667 --> 59:10.469
She met Bill Clinton in 1978.

59:10.502 --> 59:13.305
He invited her
to drop by his campaign office

59:13.339 --> 59:14.807
in Little Rock.

59:14.841 --> 59:16.909
-Did you like him?
-JUANITA: Yes.

59:16.909 --> 59:18.210
I became a supporter.

59:18.244 --> 59:20.579
And he told me
if I was ever in Little Rock

59:20.579 --> 59:22.314
to come down
to the campaign office.

59:22.348 --> 59:24.583
So, next time I was there,
I did,

59:24.583 --> 59:26.753
and we made a plan
to meet for coffee

59:26.753 --> 59:28.755
and talk about
state reimbursements

59:28.755 --> 59:30.723
to nursing homes.

59:30.757 --> 59:32.258
But Broaddrick says
when Clinton arrived,

59:32.324 --> 59:35.561
Clinton asked to meet
in her hotel room.

59:35.594 --> 59:38.064
Did you have any qualms
about that?

59:38.097 --> 59:40.099
I was a little uneasy.

59:40.166 --> 59:43.402
But I didn't feel any...

59:43.435 --> 59:46.673
any sense of danger.

59:46.706 --> 59:48.841
But then

59:48.875 --> 59:51.744
we were talking in my room,

59:51.778 --> 59:53.445
and all of a sudden,

59:53.512 --> 59:57.249
he sort of turned me around

59:57.283 --> 59:59.418
and started kissing me.

59:59.451 --> 1:00:03.455
That was a real shock.

1:00:03.522 --> 1:00:05.124
What did you do?

1:00:05.191 --> 1:00:08.594
I-I pushed him away at first.

1:00:08.627 --> 1:00:12.464
I just told him,
"Please don't do that."

1:00:12.531 --> 1:00:14.633
And he said,

1:00:14.701 --> 1:00:18.104
"Well, did you not know
why I was coming up here?"

1:00:18.137 --> 1:00:20.807
And then what happened?

1:00:20.873 --> 1:00:22.942
Then he tries to kiss me again.

1:00:22.975 --> 1:00:25.111
And the second time
he tries to kiss me,

1:00:25.144 --> 1:00:28.981
he starts... biting.

1:00:31.083 --> 1:00:32.719
On my lip.

1:00:32.752 --> 1:00:35.421
I... Just...

1:00:37.724 --> 1:00:39.158
I try to pull away from him,

1:00:39.225 --> 1:00:43.062
and then he forces me down
on the bed.

1:00:43.095 --> 1:00:45.664
And I just was...

1:00:45.664 --> 1:00:48.334
very frightened.

1:00:49.668 --> 1:00:51.137
And I tried to pull away
from him.

1:00:51.170 --> 1:00:52.571
I tried to get away,

1:00:52.604 --> 1:00:56.175
and I told him no.

1:00:56.242 --> 1:00:58.745
That this was not something
that I wanted to happen,

1:00:58.778 --> 1:01:00.980
and he just didn't listen to me.

1:01:01.013 --> 1:01:02.681
Did you resist?

1:01:02.749 --> 1:01:05.351
Did you tell him to stop?

1:01:05.351 --> 1:01:07.519
Yes, I told him,
"Please, don't."

1:01:07.519 --> 1:01:10.522
But he... was just
a different person.

1:01:10.522 --> 1:01:12.324
He was just a...

1:01:12.358 --> 1:01:15.194
vicious, awful person.

1:01:15.194 --> 1:01:17.096
(Juanita sniffles)

1:01:18.697 --> 1:01:20.532
Then everything was over with,

1:01:20.532 --> 1:01:22.668
and he got up
and straightened himself,

1:01:22.701 --> 1:01:25.671
and I was crying and...

1:01:25.704 --> 1:01:27.673
He walks to the door

1:01:27.706 --> 1:01:31.710
and just calmly puts on
his sunglasses.

1:01:33.312 --> 1:01:35.681
Before he goes out, he says,

1:01:35.714 --> 1:01:39.051
"Better get some ice on that."

1:01:39.118 --> 1:01:41.954
So, you're saying
that Bill Clinton

1:01:41.988 --> 1:01:44.123
sexually assaulted you?

1:01:44.156 --> 1:01:47.559
-That he raped you?
-Yes.

1:01:48.828 --> 1:01:51.330
(indistinct chatter)

1:01:52.564 --> 1:01:55.234
Ugh, God, another Clinton woman.

1:01:55.301 --> 1:01:57.236
Aren't the Grammys on?

1:01:59.405 --> 1:02:00.739
(cheering and applause on TV)

1:02:00.807 --> 1:02:02.641
Oh, great.

1:02:02.674 --> 1:02:04.243
We missed it.

1:02:18.925 --> 1:02:21.593
What are you and Val doing
this weekend?

1:02:21.660 --> 1:02:23.095
Santana and Rob Thomas
are coming

1:02:23.162 --> 1:02:24.530
to the Merriweather
Post Pavilion.

1:02:25.531 --> 1:02:27.199
MAN:
Nice.

1:02:31.203 --> 1:02:32.771
TINA:
Ms. Tripp.

1:02:34.874 --> 1:02:36.442
(Linda groans)

1:02:37.509 --> 1:02:39.345
I'm awake.

1:02:39.378 --> 1:02:41.113
I'm awake. It didn't work.

1:02:41.180 --> 1:02:43.282
Oh, no, it's over. All done.

1:02:43.349 --> 1:02:45.117
You're in recovery.

1:02:45.184 --> 1:02:48.287
We'll move you
to your own room soon.

1:02:48.354 --> 1:02:50.122
I'll be going with you.

1:02:50.189 --> 1:02:53.292
I'm Tina.
I'm your private nurse.

1:02:53.359 --> 1:02:55.094
What?

1:02:55.127 --> 1:02:56.795
We can't afford that.

1:02:56.795 --> 1:02:59.631
Well, I think it's all paid for.
Remember?

1:02:59.698 --> 1:03:02.134
Oh, yeah.

1:03:02.201 --> 1:03:03.936
Lucianne.

1:03:03.970 --> 1:03:04.971
Who's that?

1:03:04.971 --> 1:03:07.306
My literary agent.

1:03:07.306 --> 1:03:09.041
Her friends.

1:03:09.075 --> 1:03:11.377
They wanted
to help me look better.

1:03:11.410 --> 1:03:13.379
That's so nice.

1:03:13.412 --> 1:03:16.315
Can I have my cigarettes?

1:03:20.719 --> 1:03:22.321
Sorry.

1:03:33.265 --> 1:03:35.334
-(phone ringing)
-(paper rustles)

1:03:39.271 --> 1:03:41.173
-Hi.
-CAT: You all moved in?

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:43.242
(sighs)
No. You're such a freak.

1:03:43.275 --> 1:03:45.177
It's been two days.
I kind of like

1:03:45.177 --> 1:03:47.679
to take my time.
Find a place for everything.

1:03:47.746 --> 1:03:49.415
(chuckles)

1:03:49.448 --> 1:03:51.017
You know your book
is everywhere, right?

1:03:51.017 --> 1:03:53.685
(exhales)
I know. It's so weird.

1:03:53.685 --> 1:03:56.655
-I have a signing later today.
-Are you nervous?

1:03:56.688 --> 1:03:58.590
I just want it all
to be over with.

1:03:58.624 --> 1:04:01.193
-And how are you doing?
-Fine.

1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:02.828
I mean, really.

1:04:02.861 --> 1:04:05.497
Cat, I'm fine.
Honestly.

1:04:05.531 --> 1:04:08.834
It's nice here.
Sometimes people leave me alone.

1:04:08.867 --> 1:04:12.504
Oh, Cat, I have to go.
I have to start getting ready

1:04:12.538 --> 1:04:13.705
to go out and be Monica.

1:04:13.772 --> 1:04:15.841
Well, give other Monica my bes.

1:04:15.874 --> 1:04:18.377
I will.
Love you.

1:04:28.454 --> 1:04:30.489
*

1:04:53.579 --> 1:04:55.681
*

1:05:01.087 --> 1:05:03.822
-Hi. You joining us for lunch?
-I'm meeting someone.

1:05:03.855 --> 1:05:06.592
Oh, thank you.

1:05:06.592 --> 1:05:09.161
Uh, the reservation
should be under Collins.

1:05:09.195 --> 1:05:11.763
He works for George.

1:05:11.763 --> 1:05:14.333
-George magazine.
-Yes, he's here.

1:05:14.366 --> 1:05:16.002
Follow me.

1:05:20.939 --> 1:05:23.942
-This way.
-Thank you.

1:05:26.212 --> 1:05:27.279
Hello.

1:05:27.346 --> 1:05:29.281
Oh, hi.

1:05:29.348 --> 1:05:33.119
God, uh, I hope it's okay to say
I didn't recognize you.

1:05:33.185 --> 1:05:36.188
Thank you. I hope
you can write that. (chuckles)

1:05:36.222 --> 1:05:38.290
-That I look different.
-(chuckles)

1:05:42.228 --> 1:05:43.629
(exhales)

1:05:43.695 --> 1:05:46.298
-I'm a fan of your magazine.
-Oh, thanks.

1:05:46.365 --> 1:05:49.101
Did you ever get to meet
JFK Jr.?

1:05:49.135 --> 1:05:51.270
Yeah, of course.
He was my boss.

1:05:51.303 --> 1:05:53.272
Oh, I nearly met him once.

1:05:53.305 --> 1:05:54.873
I used to, uh, be director

1:05:54.906 --> 1:05:57.976
of this extremely visible
program

1:05:58.044 --> 1:05:59.778
under, uh,
the secretary of defense.

1:05:59.811 --> 1:06:00.979
We organized tours.

1:06:01.047 --> 1:06:03.815
Back in '97,
he almost attended one.

1:06:03.815 --> 1:06:05.484
Oh.

1:06:05.484 --> 1:06:08.820
What happened to him was so sad.

1:06:08.887 --> 1:06:11.123
-It's very tragic.
-Yeah.

1:06:11.157 --> 1:06:12.491
It was.

1:06:12.491 --> 1:06:14.626
It was devastating.

1:06:14.660 --> 1:06:16.162
(clears throat)
It okay if I, uh...?

1:06:16.162 --> 1:06:18.064
Oh. (chuckles)
Well,

1:06:18.097 --> 1:06:20.799
if anyone would have to agree
to that, it's me.

1:06:20.832 --> 1:06:22.834
(chuckles)
Right.

1:06:25.671 --> 1:06:27.339
So,

1:06:27.406 --> 1:06:29.975
you're finally talking to press.

1:06:30.008 --> 1:06:31.510
Why?

1:06:31.577 --> 1:06:33.845
(sighs)

1:06:33.912 --> 1:06:37.015
I made a horrendous mistake.

1:06:37.015 --> 1:06:39.318
For a long time,
I didn't think it appropriate

1:06:39.351 --> 1:06:41.353
to come forward,

1:06:41.353 --> 1:06:44.156
but, uh, that allowed
other forces

1:06:44.190 --> 1:06:47.593
to, um, shape
the conventional wisdom

1:06:47.626 --> 1:06:50.496
as it relates to Linda Tripp.

1:06:50.529 --> 1:06:52.831
You feel like there's been
a smear campaign against you?

1:06:52.864 --> 1:06:55.101
Of course,
but that's not all of it.

1:06:55.134 --> 1:07:00.038
Clearly, I generate, uh,
a visceral response in people.

1:07:01.039 --> 1:07:04.443
You think that would change
with a new look?

1:07:05.544 --> 1:07:07.713
I hope so.

1:07:08.714 --> 1:07:12.518
I mean, when the story broke
and I saw pictures of myself,

1:07:12.551 --> 1:07:15.121
I wanted to sink into the earth.

1:07:16.555 --> 1:07:20.959
Until all this happened,
I didn't know how ugly I was.

1:07:20.992 --> 1:07:23.862
WOMAN:
Go for an hour.
Nothing more, nothing less.

1:07:23.895 --> 1:07:26.198
We've told them you'll only
sign copies of the book,

1:07:26.232 --> 1:07:29.335
nothing else, and they
can only ask nice questions.

1:07:30.336 --> 1:07:33.572
-Nice questions?
-WOMAN: You'll do awesome.

1:07:33.639 --> 1:07:35.741
They're here
because they want to see you.

1:07:36.808 --> 1:07:38.410
COLLINS:
Have you read Monica's book?

1:07:39.411 --> 1:07:41.713
-Parts of it.
-I was surprised

1:07:41.747 --> 1:07:43.549
by how upsetting it is.

1:07:43.582 --> 1:07:45.917
She's been in a lot of pain.

1:07:45.917 --> 1:07:48.154
And she wrote
she couldn't believe the cruelty

1:07:48.187 --> 1:07:50.389
of someone
who would tape that pain.

1:07:50.422 --> 1:07:53.024
I wonder how you feel
about that.

1:07:56.595 --> 1:08:00.866
Well, uh, I don't know
what to say to that.

1:08:01.833 --> 1:08:04.236
(indistinct chatter)

1:08:04.270 --> 1:08:05.771
It's bigger than I thought.

1:08:05.837 --> 1:08:08.440
I know. It's an amazing turnout.

1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:10.242
COLLINS:
When was the last time

1:08:10.276 --> 1:08:11.577
-you spoke to Monica?
-Thank you.

1:08:11.610 --> 1:08:14.280
Uh, at the mall.

1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:15.947
That day.

1:08:16.014 --> 1:08:17.783
Do you remember what you said?

1:08:17.849 --> 1:08:21.587
I told her they'd done
the same thing to me.

1:08:21.620 --> 1:08:24.190
Was that true?

1:08:24.223 --> 1:08:26.625
No.

1:08:26.625 --> 1:08:29.027
No, it was a lie.

1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:31.463
But...

1:08:31.530 --> 1:08:34.700
I didn't...
I didn't know what to say

1:08:34.733 --> 1:08:36.935
in that moment.

1:08:36.968 --> 1:08:39.938
What would you say to her now?
If you saw her?

1:08:39.971 --> 1:08:42.374
Would you ever try
to reach out to her?

1:08:45.377 --> 1:08:49.448
Oh, I don't, uh, I don't think
that would be welcome.

1:08:49.481 --> 1:08:51.450
(cheering and applause)

1:08:51.483 --> 1:08:53.485
(reporters clamoring)

1:08:56.988 --> 1:08:58.490
(mouths)

1:09:04.663 --> 1:09:06.665
WOMAN:
Monica! Monica! Over here!

1:09:06.732 --> 1:09:08.500
-Monica!
-MAN: Monica!

1:09:09.501 --> 1:09:13.071
WOMAN:
Monica, you look so gorgeous.

1:09:13.104 --> 1:09:15.341
Monica! Monica?

1:09:15.341 --> 1:09:18.176
(clamoring continues)

1:09:18.176 --> 1:09:20.479
WOMAN 2:
We love you, Monica!

1:09:20.512 --> 1:09:22.681
We love you! We love you!

1:09:22.681 --> 1:09:24.850
MAN 2:
Oh, my God, Monica.

1:09:24.850 --> 1:09:27.018
Hi, Monica.

1:09:27.018 --> 1:09:29.855
-Monica! Monica!
-Thank you.

1:09:29.855 --> 1:09:32.090
-(clamoring echoes)
-WOMAN 2: Monica!

1:09:32.123 --> 1:09:35.361
I'm just trying to talk
to Monica.

1:09:39.965 --> 1:09:42.368
(echoing clamoring)

1:09:46.805 --> 1:09:49.174
WOMAN:
Monica! Monica!

1:09:49.207 --> 1:09:50.676
I love your lipstick.

1:09:50.709 --> 1:09:52.010
Hey, do you still love Bill?

1:09:52.043 --> 1:09:53.345
WOMAN 2:
No questions!

1:09:53.379 --> 1:09:54.946
MAN:
She can answer a question
if she wants!

1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:56.348
Come on.

1:09:56.382 --> 1:09:58.183
WOMAN 3:
Monica, I'm your biggest fan.

1:09:58.216 --> 1:10:01.052
-(clamoring and applause)
-I need a moment.

1:10:02.053 --> 1:10:04.856
(audience groans)

1:10:04.890 --> 1:10:06.892
(clamoring continues
in distance)

1:10:12.564 --> 1:10:16.134
I know in a million years,

1:10:16.167 --> 1:10:19.638
she'll probably
never understand.

1:10:19.671 --> 1:10:22.741
What do you want her
to understand?

1:10:25.744 --> 1:10:29.147
I know it looks horrible.
(chuckles softly)

1:10:29.180 --> 1:10:32.150
I know it looks like a betrayal.

1:10:34.653 --> 1:10:37.589
But she was his victim.

1:10:37.656 --> 1:10:40.258
He caused all this.

1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:43.261
He did.

1:10:45.664 --> 1:10:48.867
I just wish she could see
that I saved her.

1:10:52.771 --> 1:10:54.673
-(clamoring)
-(knock on door)

1:10:54.706 --> 1:10:56.174
Monica, are you okay?

1:10:56.207 --> 1:10:57.876
(knock on door)

1:11:00.211 --> 1:11:03.849
Just need a minute.
I'll be okay.

1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:10.288
I'll be okay.

1:11:12.691 --> 1:11:14.626
(inhales)

1:11:14.693 --> 1:11:18.730
