RAFAEL:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:47.839 --> 00:50.300
Hold up.
(laughs)

00:50.341 --> 00:52.052
You're out of control, bro.
What?

00:52.093 --> 00:54.387
We know you're descended
from King Arthur's bloodline.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.139
Everything I'm saying
could have happened.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.433
have.
(laughs)

00:58.475 --> 01:00.935
What is Hope doing
there, exactly?
I... I got carried away.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.188
Look, I don't understand
how you're not into this.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.023
If I knew I was descended
from kings...

01:05.065 --> 01:06.357
That's always been
the difference

01:06.399 --> 01:07.776
between you and me, Lan.

01:07.817 --> 01:09.569
You've always wanted
to be special.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.362
I've just wanted to be normal.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.866
Have a... a home,
friends and a family.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.868
And look, now that we have that,

01:16.910 --> 01:19.204
I don't need some
fantasy role-playing

01:19.245 --> 01:20.663
to tell me where I come from.

01:20.705 --> 01:22.207
This is history.
(laughs)

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
And after all
we've been through,

01:24.292 --> 01:26.711
look, I'm done looking back.
Okay, fine,
can you just give me

01:26.753 --> 01:28.004
my book back, please?

01:28.046 --> 01:29.172
This book?
Yes, that book.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.173
Just give me the book.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.425
Wait, wait, no.
Stop, stop.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.135
(laughing)

01:37.388 --> 01:39.224
Raf, let go now.
I can't hear you.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.225
I-I can't hear you.
Raf, stop.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.893
What?

01:44.062 --> 01:45.438
Huh?

01:50.401 --> 01:52.237
(grunts, retches)

01:54.489 --> 01:55.365
(retching)

02:00.578 --> 02:03.039
(Rafael coughs)

02:03.081 --> 02:05.166
♪ ♪

02:10.338 --> 02:12.924
Found him by the back gate
this morning.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.760
I just, I don't get it.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.929
I thought you said Chad was
walking and talking yesterday.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.889
Why does he look like
he's been dead for three months?

02:19.931 --> 02:22.433
Because he has been.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.311
The Necromancer was
keeping him alive

02:25.353 --> 02:26.896
until I did the
deal with him.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.982
Why would Dollar Store
Jack Sparrow set him free

02:29.023 --> 02:30.692
one day just to turn around
and kill him the next?

02:31.901 --> 02:33.403
I don't know.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.574
Dr. Saltzman.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.123
(grunts)

02:46.457 --> 02:47.792
Ow.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.211
(winces)

03:02.599 --> 03:04.767
Who's doing the magic analysis?

03:04.809 --> 03:07.437
I think Ms. Featherwood.

03:07.478 --> 03:08.771
We can do it ourselves.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.982
It shouldn't be too hard
to figure out.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.442
Let's go take a look.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.370
(groans)
What are you doing?

03:24.412 --> 03:26.831
(exhales)
Getting the hell out of here.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.416
You don't want to wait
for the results?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.918
Is waiting around gonna
change anything, Lan?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.252
Look, I...

03:31.294 --> 03:34.172
(exhales)
I just can't sit here.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.716
Okay. Whatever you need,
I'm there.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.721
We had a deal!

03:41.763 --> 03:44.390
Oh, I'm well aware

03:44.432 --> 03:46.768
and coursing with black magic
as a result.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.395
So you'd do well
to watch your tone.

03:52.815 --> 03:55.276
Oh, see, that's more like it.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.737
But you really didn't
have to get me anything.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.697
(laughs)
Oh...

03:59.739 --> 04:02.867
I'll be damned.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.453
Is this...?
Your former acolyte.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.205
Chad.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.499
I knew him well, Horatio.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.209
Oh, stop playing games.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.585
This was all your doing.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.671
Hardly.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.715
We sealed our pact
with a covenant spell.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.094
I obviously upheld my end
of the bargain,

04:21.135 --> 04:23.471
hence the magic
I now possess.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.682
I severed my connection to them,

04:25.723 --> 04:27.016
just like you asked,

04:27.058 --> 04:28.685
no strings attached.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.937
(chuckles)

04:30.979 --> 04:33.064
(laughing raucously)

04:34.816 --> 04:37.318
(continues laughing)

04:37.360 --> 04:39.279
What is so damn funny?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.906
I followed your word
to the letter,

04:41.948 --> 04:44.450
but as I was the one who
brought them back to life...

04:44.492 --> 04:46.035
(laughs)

04:46.077 --> 04:48.705
It was dooming them
all over again.

04:48.746 --> 04:50.790
Precisely!

04:50.832 --> 04:52.875
(shouts)
Yeah!

04:53.835 --> 04:55.420
Oh!

04:55.461 --> 04:57.463
(laughs)

04:57.505 --> 04:59.299
So they are gonna die?

04:59.340 --> 05:02.552
The wolf, most definitely.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.013
By sunrise,
I'd imagine.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.015
But the phoenix--
ah, it's doubtful.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.392
I'm not sure he was
ever technically dead,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.853
to be honest, given his
powers of resurrection.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.856
And what about Alyssa?

05:14.897 --> 05:15.982
Chin up.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.151
One out of three ain't bad.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.446
Mm. Fine.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.573
Be that way.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.742
ALARIC:
I wish I had better news.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.119
We don't have much time.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.162
Super Squad always
saves the day.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.371
What do you
need us to do?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.831
Anything we can.

05:31.873 --> 05:32.999
We should also
make a plan

05:33.041 --> 05:35.710
for if...
things don't go our way.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.338
What?

05:38.379 --> 05:40.631
We got to be realistic
about our odds here.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.091
Right?
You leave the
worst-case scenario

05:42.133 --> 05:43.509
up to me.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.969
In the meantime,

05:45.011 --> 05:47.305
just keep looking for loopholes.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.183
Jed, the pack should be
with him right now.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.143
Pack can't help
with this, Dr. S.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.603
Why not?

05:53.644 --> 05:56.189
A dying wolf separates himself
from the pack.

05:56.230 --> 05:58.399
We have to respect
his privacy,

05:58.441 --> 06:00.651
keep our distance unless
he chooses to reach out to us.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.655
Is that how you'd
want to be treated?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.992
Sorry.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.452
It's just our nature.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.789
Lizzie,

06:12.830 --> 06:15.083
the witches--

06:15.124 --> 06:16.793
have them keep trying any
and all healing spells.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.169
Already on it.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.046
Plus, we gave Raf an elixir

06:20.088 --> 06:22.507
that links him
to the lunar cycle.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.883
It's a Band-Aid, but it will
hold off his symptoms

06:23.925 --> 06:24.801
until the morning.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.260
When he drops dead.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.889
I said that out loud.
I am so...

06:29.931 --> 06:33.518
My point is, if anyone can
find a way to save him,

06:33.559 --> 06:35.311
it's us.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.604
(door opens)
HOPE: There's only one

06:36.646 --> 06:38.481
problem with that.

06:38.523 --> 06:39.649
Rafael took off.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.567
He's gone.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.539
LANDON:
This is your big dope plan?

06:54.580 --> 06:56.541
Camping?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.042
Yeah.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.670
A whole lot of fishing,
grilling and chilling.

07:00.711 --> 07:03.464
(chuckles)
Like we did just when
we were ordinary kids.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.674
(laughs)
Come on, dude.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.800
(laughs)
Yeah, sounds like
the perfect day.

07:05.842 --> 07:06.676
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.513
(Rafael groans)

07:10.555 --> 07:11.889
Hey, I hope you

07:11.931 --> 07:14.350
don't mind me bringing
my dad along for the fun.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.894
The more,
the merrier.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.021
Walt has no idea
that we're even coming.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.940
I'm-a go surprise him.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.316
I'll get our stuff.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.651
Okay.
(chuckles)

07:23.693 --> 07:25.486
Yo, Pops.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.155
Hello?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.247
(door closes)
What's wrong?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.498
He's not in there.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.792
Oh. Okay. Uh...

07:39.834 --> 07:41.711
You want to just
wait or...?
It's fine.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.880
We can just go.
Go? Go where?

07:43.921 --> 07:46.716
It's-it's not a big deal.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.110
(sniffles)

08:11.824 --> 08:13.868
I'm scared.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.374
(grunts, sighs)

08:20.416 --> 08:22.376
(sniffles)

08:24.670 --> 08:26.797
(horn honks)

08:26.839 --> 08:28.716
Son of a bitch.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.177
(siren chirps)

08:31.219 --> 08:35.431
Pal, your day just got
a lot more interest...

08:35.473 --> 08:37.183
(sighs)

08:37.225 --> 08:39.435
Before you take me downtown,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.604
I still get my one phone call,
right?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.648
Oh, so you do know how
phones work. Interesting.

08:43.689 --> 08:44.899
I've been meaning to call.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.817
But you never did.
'Cause I had to

08:46.859 --> 08:48.819
take a trip with my daughters
to see their uncle.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.655
It's a long story,
but the point is,

08:50.696 --> 08:52.448
(exhales)
I am sorry.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.534
And I've even more
sorry to say

08:54.575 --> 08:56.577
that I'm here because
I need your help.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.788
Oh, another one
of your novels?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.082
I'm looking for
a missing person.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.458
Somebody who's gone
to great lengths

09:02.500 --> 09:04.168
not to be found.
I'm sorry, Ric.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.628
but I have a job.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.129
And I can't be
running around

09:07.171 --> 09:08.965
helping you whenever you want.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.008
Yeah, but you will.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.596
'Cause when I had Kaleb
compel you to forget,

09:15.638 --> 09:17.098
I had him tell you
to listen to me

09:17.139 --> 09:18.474
in cases of life and death.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.605
Okay.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.109
Who are we looking for?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.068
NECROMANCER:
I made you

09:29.110 --> 09:30.820
an offer!

09:30.861 --> 09:33.364
And I'm considering it.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.075
If my skill set can affect
real change around here.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.745
Starting with this.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.040
is the reconstituted
Malivore Pit.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.419
It's a portal
to another dimension,

09:46.460 --> 09:48.629
forged by my own black hand.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.131
It's an eyesore.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.342
But I guess we could
throw a rug over it.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.636
We will do no such thing.
You clearly

09:55.678 --> 09:57.221
do not understand the
power dynamic at play here.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.431
Oh, sure I do.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.683
The way I see it,
this is a job interview.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.560
So this is as much about me
interviewing you

10:02.602 --> 10:04.395
as it is about you
interviewing me.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.730
Now,

10:05.771 --> 10:07.898
how are you gonna
raise Malivore?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.775
What's your, like, plan?

10:09.817 --> 10:11.902
(scoffs, chuckles)

10:11.944 --> 10:16.157
Your mind would shatter
at its sheer scope.

10:19.827 --> 10:20.828
Then get to shattering.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.039
'Cause I'm not

10:23.080 --> 10:26.375
signing up until I know exactly
what our mission statement is.

10:26.417 --> 10:27.710
Mission statement?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.295
And, more importantly,

10:29.337 --> 10:31.839
how much pain and misery
it's gonna rain down

10:31.881 --> 10:33.424
on the Salvatore School.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.968
So, go ahead.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.012
Pitch me.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.858
LIZZIE:
So, about those
healing spells.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.817
None of them worked?

10:51.859 --> 10:53.277
Not as intended.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.779
Well,

10:54.820 --> 10:56.697
the day is not over yet.

10:56.739 --> 10:58.532
Hope, we've tried
everything.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.034
You know what
we need to do.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.119
We're not doing a linking spell.
Why not?

11:02.161 --> 11:03.579
It's the exact thing
that you did

11:03.621 --> 11:05.581
to save me from the Merge.
But that was different.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.084
If I link Landon to Raf, Landon
would have to die and resurrect

11:08.125 --> 11:09.669
every single day.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.920
We don't know how many lives
Landon has left.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.088
We could kill them both.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.465
Well, have you thought

11:14.507 --> 11:17.051
about what Landon would want?

11:18.803 --> 11:20.471
(sighs)

11:25.976 --> 11:28.938
I might have another idea.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.232
God, I hate waiting around
like this.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.485
Every second counts.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.362
Well, I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.614
And what if he's not?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.827
I may never get
to say goodbye, Lan.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.166
Don't say that.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.168
(scoffs)

11:51.210 --> 11:53.045
One day is all I wanted.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.133
I just wanted one day
to be normal again.

11:57.174 --> 12:00.094
Look, we're gonna beat this.
Come on, man.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.096
Does that sound like my life?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.850
Nothing ever goes my way, Lan.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.437
What makes you think that
today's gonna be any different?

12:09.478 --> 12:10.938
(door opens)

12:10.980 --> 12:12.565
Hey, camping trip's over.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.233
Y'all got to get y'all asses
back to school.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.444
Hope has a plan.

12:16.485 --> 12:17.862
KALEB:
Come on.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.166
So Hope wants to use Clarke's
Freaky Friday tuning fork

12:30.207 --> 12:32.168
to put Raf's consciousness
in someone else's body?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.836
Look, I know
it's not ideal, okay?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.463
But if we modify
and reforge the Trident,

12:35.504 --> 12:37.381
then a siphon like me
can use it

12:37.423 --> 12:39.550
to transfer energy
instead of consciousness.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.302
Well-well,
wait, wait.

12:41.343 --> 12:44.013
What kind of energy?
And into who?

12:44.054 --> 12:46.640
Well, my first choice was Jed,

12:46.682 --> 12:49.518
but unfortunately,
it has to be...

12:51.103 --> 12:52.855
...phoenix energy.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.356
Phoenix?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.066
So what does that mean
for Landon?

12:56.108 --> 12:59.153
I'm guessing
it means I become human.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.988
Mortal?

13:02.698 --> 13:05.659
Which is probably why Hope isn't
here to tell me herself.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.164
(laughing):
Thank you.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.165
That's it?

13:13.876 --> 13:15.878
Were you expecting more?

13:15.920 --> 13:19.632
Kind of.
(groaning)

13:19.673 --> 13:21.008
(yells)

13:21.050 --> 13:22.676
(glass breaking)

13:22.718 --> 13:25.054
Your puny mind could not
possibly process

13:25.095 --> 13:28.390
the profundity of my plot!

13:28.432 --> 13:30.935
One: acquire buttload
of dark magic.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.103
Two: use aforementioned buttload

13:33.145 --> 13:35.147
to reenact the original
Triad spell

13:35.189 --> 13:37.399
and raise Malivore
from the Pit. Three:

13:37.441 --> 13:38.526
rewrite the spell
so that Malivore serves you

13:38.567 --> 13:40.069
instead of the Triad.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.197
Four: Malivore is your servant
forever.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.909
Yes. That's pretty much it.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.203
Well, I didn't say
plan.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.039
It's just a little small.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.874
What?

13:53.916 --> 13:55.793
I get why you're pissed
at Malivore, but

13:55.835 --> 13:58.128
don't you think you should do
more with all that black magic

13:58.170 --> 14:00.923
than bring him back
to shine your shoes?

14:00.965 --> 14:02.550
He started it.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.009
It's petty.

14:04.051 --> 14:06.428
You're better than this.
Ah...

14:06.470 --> 14:08.305
better than this.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.768
This spell's a sequel, right?

14:12.810 --> 14:16.397
That means it has to be bigger
and badder than the one before.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.441
I must admit, I like
the sound of that.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.194
What do you have in mind?

14:22.236 --> 14:25.781
We bring back Malivore,
just like you said.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.033
But we don't stop there.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.495
(chuckles)
We bring back...

14:31.537 --> 14:34.081
the monsters.

I'm here about your son.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.085
I don't have a son.

(chuckles)
You built this today?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.240
Yeah.
Damn, girl.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.825
You want to thank me?

15:51.867 --> 15:54.119
Be sure to tell my dad
how awesome I am.

15:54.161 --> 15:57.164
Sometimes I think
he wonders.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.541
He'll figure it out.
Your dad's a good guy.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.169
You're lucky,
you know?

16:02.211 --> 16:04.463
To have a dad
like him.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.882
Who makes mistakes because
he's trying to protect you.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.009
(sighs)

16:10.344 --> 16:13.097
Well, at least
you have the moppet.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.935
Yeah.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.270
But I hate that it has
to come to this for him.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.107
HOPE:
Are you sure about this?

16:23.148 --> 16:27.111
Uh, I mean, it's
kind of ironic, huh?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.988
Raf spent all day
yesterday convincing me

16:29.029 --> 16:31.198
to go back inside my body,
and today he needs me

16:31.240 --> 16:33.659
to give the most important piece
of it away.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.078
It's not the most
important piece.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.122
You sure about that?

16:39.623 --> 16:42.292
It doesn't...
it doesn't matter.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.503
I'd lay in front
of a bus for him.

16:44.545 --> 16:45.921
At least this plan seems
a lot less painful.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.674
LIZZIE:
We're ready.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.722
(sighs)

17:03.522 --> 17:05.774
(sighs)

17:05.816 --> 17:07.526
Um...

17:09.319 --> 17:11.947
Let's get started.
Moppet, you are here.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.616
Raf, there.

17:14.658 --> 17:19.204
And, Hope, you're moral support,
so don't screw it up.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.835
(sighs)

17:30.466 --> 17:32.426
Thanks.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.267
(sighs)

17:45.606 --> 17:48.067
You can start now.

17:50.277 --> 17:54.073
start, but
nothing's happening.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.325
What do you mean?

17:56.366 --> 17:58.994
There isn't any magic
in the moppet to siphon.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.039
I don't
understand.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.416
She means
I'm not a phoenix anymore.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.055
It makes sense. The golden
arrow felled the phoenix,

18:18.097 --> 18:19.515
just like the prophecy said.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.016
Wait. But you were brought back.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.351
As a human, but the
phoenix part of me died,

18:22.392 --> 18:25.187
leaving me one final,
mortal life.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.689
I should have known.
I can feel it. I feel...

18:27.731 --> 18:29.858
different.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.527
I can't believe
that this is happening.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.278
We'll run more tests.
Maybe there's something

18:33.320 --> 18:34.738
we missed.
LANDON:
I can go outside

18:34.780 --> 18:35.823
and try to fly.
How? By jumping off a roof

18:35.864 --> 18:37.282
and hoping you sprout wings

18:37.324 --> 18:38.450
before you break your neck?

18:38.492 --> 18:39.618
RAFAEL:
No!

18:40.369 --> 18:44.957
I don't want to waste another
second fighting a losing battle.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.667
I want to make
the most of whatever

18:46.708 --> 18:48.293
little time that I have left.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.757
Just want to be with...
with my friends.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.304
I want to go out
on my own terms.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.683
LUCIA:
What are you gonna do with me?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.393
Take you to your son.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.311
Rafael. He needs you.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.107
(sighs)
He's dying.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.403
He's a werewolf,

19:14.444 --> 19:16.446
like you.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.490
It's a...

19:18.532 --> 19:22.077
a complicated story, but he only
has one day left to live.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.790
He's a good kid.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.293
He's a really good kid.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.920
And he shouldn't have
to face his fate alone.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.339
He deserves

19:34.381 --> 19:36.133
to have people by his side
who love him.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.552
He...

19:38.594 --> 19:40.971
have his mother.
Why?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.056
He never did.

19:45.309 --> 19:49.021
I left him because
I couldn't be that for him.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.444
He's better off without me.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.288
(clears throat)
Mac, what are you doing?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.458
She can go.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.128
If it's what you want.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.559
She'll come back.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.686
Trust me.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.110
(crowd chatter, laughter)

20:37.152 --> 20:39.488
Hey.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.907
(grunts) Could use
those Tribrid muscles.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.700
Got a couple more kegs
I need to haul over.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.537
But I can see that

20:47.579 --> 20:50.457
you're not in the mood
for a, um... for a party.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.918
(sighs)

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
I think I'm just
a sore loser.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.423
I've beaten death more
times than I care to count,

20:58.465 --> 21:01.301
and I really thought we
were gonna beat it again.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.722
Hey, uh... it's okay, Hope.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.768
I'm serious.
I'm not afraid.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.646
I believe that everyone gets
their own version of heaven.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.775
For me, it's gonna be
my best day ever,

21:16.817 --> 21:20.362
just on a loop.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.698
A day outside
with the people I love.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.535
But...

21:26.576 --> 21:31.415
I'm gonna appreciate
everything I can while I'm here.

21:31.456 --> 21:35.877
I mean, a supernova that we can
actually see with our naked eye?

21:39.339 --> 21:41.550
I mean, that's once
in a lifetime.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.594
A lifetime.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.265
Hey, um, there's something
that I need you to do.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.392
It's, uh, one last favor,
it's, uh, for Landon.
Sorry.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.269
I can't right now.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.823
(indistinct whispering)

22:12.372 --> 22:14.624
Yo!
(scoffs)

22:14.666 --> 22:16.501
What's with the long faces?

22:16.543 --> 22:19.421
Come on, I wanted
this to be a-a party,

22:19.463 --> 22:21.631
like the one the first night
when I came here.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.384
Not a funeral.
(chuckles)

22:24.426 --> 22:26.178
We're trying our best,

22:26.219 --> 22:27.929
Raf, but it's...

22:27.971 --> 22:29.765
it's a lot.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.516
RAFAEL:
Look, just-just think

22:31.558 --> 22:33.935
of something, uh, funny.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.605
Or something stupid
or embarrassing that I did

22:36.646 --> 22:38.231
that you'll always remember.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.275
Like the, um...
Wh-- Uh, what was it?

22:40.317 --> 22:42.986
Uh...

22:43.028 --> 22:45.113
"Expectation was a cancer."

22:45.155 --> 22:46.948
(laughter)
"Oh, you can't, sir?

22:46.990 --> 22:49.284
Then who will?" Come on.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.662
That awful beat poetry thing
I did?

22:52.704 --> 22:55.332
Then there was that one time
you turned with your uniform on.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.584
It was pretty wild,

22:57.626 --> 23:01.922
seeing a full-blown werewolf
with a tie around its neck.

23:01.963 --> 23:05.592
That's the spirit.
Keep it going.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.513
KALEB:
Okay, well, I don't know
if this is too funny,

23:09.554 --> 23:11.306
but there was that time...

23:11.348 --> 23:13.475
(laughter)

23:14.684 --> 23:15.644
RAFAEL:
Lan.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.646
(panting)

23:17.687 --> 23:20.440
Man, come on. Bring your
ass outside. (chuckles)

23:20.482 --> 23:22.734
What? I know you got
dirt on me for days.

23:24.694 --> 23:26.321
I'm sorry.

39:09.889 --> 39:11.640
when I'm unbreakable, and today,
when you were telling me

39:11.682 --> 39:13.100
that I go back to being just me,

39:13.142 --> 39:14.852
you didn't say
that it'd be okay,

39:14.894 --> 39:16.854
that we would be okay.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.065
And I know why you
didn't say it.

39:21.275 --> 39:23.027
'Cause you don't believe it.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.865
Admit that.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.246
(sighs)

39:36.582 --> 39:39.877
I promised Raf that I'd live
my life the best I can.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.465
And what you want
isn't living, Hope.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.135
Not to me.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.436
NECROMANCER:
So, in conclusion,

39:57.478 --> 40:00.648
Malivore is raised,
beholden to me.

40:00.689 --> 40:05.861
All the monsters incarcerated in
his accursed pit are liberated.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.739
And I, the Almighty Necromancer,

40:08.781 --> 40:10.991
shall hold dominion over them

40:11.033 --> 40:14.745
and this entire plane.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.123
(exhales)
(Alyssa clears throat)

40:20.000 --> 40:22.753
shall hold dominion.

40:22.795 --> 40:25.798
Partners.
That's what we said.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.259
(laughs)

40:28.300 --> 40:31.387
It really is none
of your concern.

40:31.429 --> 40:35.975
And not the reason I reunited
your soul with your furry flesh.

40:36.016 --> 40:39.687
Then why am I returned?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.856
Because you're
an all-seeing oracle.

40:41.897 --> 40:43.774
So shouldn't you know?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.443
I surely could.

40:45.484 --> 40:48.237
But I quite like
the way he talks.

40:48.279 --> 40:53.159
Then listen well,
you fantastic man-lion,

40:53.200 --> 40:55.202
and answer me this:

40:55.244 --> 40:58.330
will our plan fail or succeed?

41:08.174 --> 41:11.969
It shall come to pass
as you have described.

41:12.011 --> 41:15.890
Ah! Yeah!

41:15.931 --> 41:18.017
And what about
the Salvatore students?

41:18.058 --> 41:19.727
Will they suffer?

41:19.768 --> 41:21.479
Very much.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.314
And one...

41:23.355 --> 41:24.648
will die.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.913
Told you it'd work.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.543
You were right...

41:44.585 --> 41:46.212
partner.

41:46.253 --> 41:48.255
