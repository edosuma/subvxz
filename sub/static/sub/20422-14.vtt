Those damned adventurers...

00:08.230 --> 00:13.530
<b>Magic Circle Linked Path Train
Iron-Steel Train</b>

00:08.960 --> 00:12.310
They say what they really wanted 
to make was a flying machine.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.650
They're so greedy.

00:15.030 --> 00:17.600
It was Miss Nureha, an adventurer,

00:17.600 --> 00:21.040
who gave us People of the 
Land the iron-steel train.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.790
Watch your mouth.

00:24.590 --> 00:27.670
Whatever you say, Captain of the Royal Guard.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.710
You're supposed to keep an eye on this?

00:31.710 --> 00:34.030
You always get the crappy jobs.

00:34.960 --> 00:36.520
So where's Miss Nureha?

00:36.910 --> 00:37.990
Not here yet.

00:37.990 --> 00:39.680
Locked up in her room again?

00:40.330 --> 00:43.610
What does Indicus intend to do with that princess?

00:44.030 --> 00:45.660
She's a replacement for Kanami, right?

00:46.230 --> 00:49.690
You think someone could actually replace her?

00:50.240 --> 00:51.070
You're right.

00:51.570 --> 00:54.560
It's been two years since she left the Tea Party.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.700
Who knows what she's doing now?

00:57.310 --> 00:59.580
She's heading straight here.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.060
I met Kanami on the China server.

01:04.870 --> 01:07.810
She's... Kanami's back in the game?

01:08.290 --> 01:09.090
Yep.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.990
And the scary thing is that 
she hadn't changed a bit.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.470
She was exactly like she was with us.

01:14.970 --> 01:17.630
She was as much Kanami as ever.

02:50.090 --> 02:52.110
Just after the Apocalypse,

02:52.110 --> 02:55.980
I went to the continent to gather 
information about this world.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.270
Using Soul Possession to possess a white horse.

02:59.850 --> 03:00.940
And there...

03:05.600 --> 03:06.910
This is so great!

03:06.910 --> 03:08.470
So much adventure!

03:08.250 --> 03:10.290
<b>Kanami

03:08.470 --> 03:10.000
Let's go, Froggy-nardo!

03:10.380 --> 03:11.720
It's not Froggy-nardo.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.580
It's Leonardo!

03:18.370 --> 03:20.300
And I found Kanami.

03:20.380 --> 03:26.310
<b>Kanami, Go East!</b>

03:21.890 --> 03:23.780
Kanami, Go East.

03:27.880 --> 03:28.990
There's no end to them.

03:28.990 --> 03:30.200
I told you.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.250
This is a raid-rank event!

03:32.250 --> 03:35.980
The number of Daylight Shades 
exceeds two thousand.

03:35.980 --> 03:39.120
We can't use revivals or return spells to run, right?

03:39.120 --> 03:39.940
Awesome!

03:40.240 --> 03:44.070
Because of the Fairy Eye curse, 
I can't finish any of them.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.710
What kind of party is this?

03:45.710 --> 03:47.670
A gap has appeared on the battlefield.

03:50.350 --> 03:51.080
What?

03:51.290 --> 03:53.330
Let's go, Eri-Eri, Froggy-nardo!

03:53.690 --> 03:55.090
I'm not Froggy-nardo!

03:55.090 --> 03:57.480
We have to go on foot?

03:58.690 --> 04:00.800
Huh? You're KR?

04:00.800 --> 04:03.450
I thought you were a horse someone sent.

04:03.450 --> 04:05.470
You haven't changed a bit.

04:05.470 --> 04:09.740
Didn't you move overseas in 
real life, and quit the game?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.190
I got back into it in Rome.

04:12.190 --> 04:13.860
And now this happened.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.980
And? What are you doing on the China server?

04:17.740 --> 04:19.490
Heading to Japan!

04:19.490 --> 04:20.720
To Yamato?

04:19.490 --> 04:21.650
Kanami, it isn't that way.

04:20.720 --> 04:21.650
Why?

04:23.530 --> 04:27.410
In Yamato, they're calling this 
the "Apocalypse," right?

04:28.010 --> 04:30.870
I want to know why it happened.

04:31.380 --> 04:34.920
Kanami says it might have something 
to do with the Novasphere Pioneers.

04:35.560 --> 04:40.640
The twelfth expansion pack 
for the MMORPG <i>Elder Tale</i>,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.550
the Novasphere Pioneers.

04:42.910 --> 04:47.620
It's true that we were sent to this 
world right after it went live.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.430
But why Japan?

04:49.430 --> 04:51.630
Japan is in the East.

04:51.630 --> 04:55.690
The expansion was set to go live 
at exactly midnight, on May 3rd.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.400
So due to the time zone, it was only 
implemented on the Japan server?

05:00.400 --> 05:01.440
Right.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.700
And as she headed to the East, 
she had companions.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.980
I miss giga-meat.

05:08.870 --> 05:14.660
<b>Leonardo 
Race/ Human 
Assassin, Lv. 90 
No Guild</b>

05:09.580 --> 05:12.530
Leonardo, an assassin who'd used 
fairy rings to come from the

05:12.530 --> 05:14.660
America server and couldn't get back.

05:15.230 --> 05:18.040
Supposedly, he'd just joined the party.

05:18.370 --> 05:20.170
Do you desire healing?

05:20.550 --> 05:24.670
Coppelia, a cleric Kanami had met on her travels.

05:20.860 --> 05:24.670
<b>Coppelia 
Race/ Human 
Cleric, Lv. 90 
No Guild</b>

05:24.950 --> 05:27.090
No, I just want to eat some pizza.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.430
And Erius Hackblade.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.340
What?

05:31.340 --> 05:32.670
The progenitor?

05:31.620 --> 05:39.940
<b>Erius Hackblade 
Race/ Elf 
Blademancer, Lv. 100 
Redbranch Knights</b>

05:33.070 --> 05:35.240
A hero who belongs to the Redbranch Knights,

05:35.240 --> 05:39.650
one of the thirteen orders of knights 
who maintain order in the world.

05:40.530 --> 05:46.070
He's a blademancer and a noble, 
blue-blooded progenitor.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.550
He's so famous, he's even on 
the <i>Elder Tale</i> package.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.070
But all the progenitors supposedly disappeared.

05:53.070 --> 05:55.460
Just like the Izumo Knights on the Yamato server.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.920
Why was he with Kanami, anyway?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.720
Because she's Kanami, I suppose.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.460
That makes sense.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.470
Anyway, we continued our journey.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.000
What's in there, Kanami?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.720

06:21.330 --> 06:22.980
What's going on? His status...

06:24.040 --> 06:25.320

06:25.850 --> 06:27.620
No, Froggy-nardo!

06:27.620 --> 06:29.220

06:40.720 --> 06:42.090
Erius! Throw him here!

06:42.560 --> 06:43.340
Understood!

06:44.990 --> 06:47.460
Arms of the fairies of the black night...

06:48.140 --> 06:49.760
<i>Night Splash!</i>

06:51.290 --> 06:52.220
You threw him too far!

06:52.220 --> 06:52.970
Oops.

06:54.510 --> 06:55.880
Watch out, Coppelia!

06:58.540 --> 06:59.850
<i>He's a Person of the Land.</i>

07:00.230 --> 07:01.550
<i>A non-player character.</i>

07:01.920 --> 07:03.610
<i>I can kill him with Assassinate.</i>

07:04.240 --> 07:05.290
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

07:05.290 --> 07:06.610
<i>He's only a program!</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:10.360
Froggy-nardo!

07:11.180 --> 07:12.420
Don't worry.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.720
I just stunned him with Paralyzing Blow.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.740
Did you see it, too, Kanami?

07:19.740 --> 07:22.000
His status was displayed in two layers.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.020
What was that?

07:24.490 --> 07:27.060
Has this ever happened before?

07:27.410 --> 07:28.010
Yes.

07:28.220 --> 07:31.900
One day people who'd been 
acting completely normally

07:31.900 --> 07:34.010
suddenly turned into beasts.

07:34.010 --> 07:36.530
We call them the plague demons.

07:36.530 --> 07:38.520
We don't know why they happen at all.

07:38.730 --> 07:43.100
<b>Plague Demons</b>

07:40.560 --> 07:43.170
So much mystery...

07:44.570 --> 07:45.580
<i>We can do it.</i>

07:46.290 --> 07:48.530
<i>If we gather all the information we can find,</i>

07:48.990 --> 07:51.930
<i>and if everyone wants to see something new.</i>

07:54.500 --> 07:58.150
In several days, a trader will be visiting the village.

07:58.150 --> 08:00.960
We need information and supplies.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.290
So we wait until he shows up?

08:04.290 --> 08:05.420
Yep!

08:09.130 --> 08:10.130
Hey, mister!

08:10.370 --> 08:11.880
Why are you green?

08:11.880 --> 08:13.230
Why are you a frog?

08:13.230 --> 08:14.890
This is the sign that I'm a hero!

08:15.590 --> 08:20.140
A frog ninja is a symbol of the most 
courageous hero in the world!

08:20.410 --> 08:21.680
I don't get it.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.920
What's a hero?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.170
Is it yummy?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.630
<i>Jeez... This is why I hate kids.</i>

08:28.100 --> 08:31.230
<i>I guess there's no point in 
getting upset at NPCs.</i>

08:33.060 --> 08:36.050
So one of the mares came 
after you in the stables?

08:36.050 --> 08:37.010
Don't laugh!

08:37.010 --> 08:38.340
Are you really popular with the ladies, KR?

08:38.340 --> 08:39.040
Shut up.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.040
Well? How's Japan doing?

08:41.430 --> 08:43.540
Is anything interesting going on?

08:43.540 --> 08:45.290
<b>Stop playing around</b>

08:45.600 --> 08:47.840
Shiro is?

08:47.840 --> 08:51.820
Evidently he's at the core of some organization 
called the "Round Table."

08:51.820 --> 08:55.930
Though on the surface, someone else leads it.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.800
That's my tour guide!

08:59.940 --> 09:01.660
What's wrong, my lord?

09:01.660 --> 09:06.150
I just felt like someone gave 
me an impossible task.

09:07.690 --> 09:09.980
<i>During the game, you couldn't start</i>

09:09.980 --> 09:12.820
<i>a new skill while still using the last.</i>

09:12.820 --> 09:18.970
<i>But now that I have a physical body, 
I can do cancels and combos!</i>

09:21.510 --> 09:23.460
Do you require healing?

09:23.460 --> 09:25.310
No, I'm fine.

09:26.910 --> 09:30.660
By the way, what do you think about 
the Novasphere Pioneers?

09:31.010 --> 09:34.970
I've been told it was applied 
to the Japan server.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.340
Then what about the Japan server?

09:38.710 --> 09:43.190
Due to my master's wishes, 
it's been plotted as a high priority.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.040
And what's your master, Kanami, like?

09:47.620 --> 09:48.930
My master is like

09:49.410 --> 09:51.260
daybreak.

09:52.060 --> 09:52.610
Huh?

09:53.550 --> 09:57.610
On the other side of that sky, 
the sun is racing forward.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.660
It has just now set.

10:01.050 --> 10:03.970
But tomorrow morning, at 0438,

10:03.970 --> 10:06.620
the eastern sky will begin to brighten.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.650
At night, the sky is dark.

10:10.040 --> 10:15.610
At early dawn, it begins to turn dark purple.

10:16.460 --> 10:18.500
Then bluish purple.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.750
Then azure.

10:20.210 --> 10:22.640
Gradually, the sky turns increasingly blue,

10:22.640 --> 10:24.370
but there is still no light.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.930
Because the sun has not appeared,

10:27.930 --> 10:29.210
it's still dark.

10:29.940 --> 10:34.900
But no one sees that blue and 
doubts that the sun will rise.

10:35.810 --> 10:38.450
That is what my master is like.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.830
Several days later, the trader's caravan arrived.

10:48.750 --> 10:54.840
<b>Chun-Lu 
Race/ Human 
Cleric, Lv. 90 
Rakurou Wolf Brigade</b>

10:49.110 --> 10:51.160
My name is Chun-Lu.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.840
I'm a wanderer with the Rakurou 
Wolf Brigade guild.

10:55.360 --> 11:00.840
I was unable to protect the other 
members of my caravan.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.600
What happened?

11:08.160 --> 11:10.800
Give them the fate of all who are inferior.

11:11.410 --> 11:14.210
The truth of all solutions.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.200
I'm sorry.

11:22.530 --> 11:26.160
Normally, it would be our job to escort you.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.860
It's fine. It's fine.

11:27.860 --> 11:30.330
We're heading east, too.

11:32.420 --> 11:36.470
The Rakurou Wolf Brigade has defended 
the People of the Land

11:36.470 --> 11:39.300
on their travels since the Apocalypse.

11:39.880 --> 11:40.720
Yet...

11:41.000 --> 11:43.930
No one blames you.

11:43.930 --> 11:44.960
But...

11:46.550 --> 11:49.260
But we come back to life.

11:49.900 --> 11:51.300
Because we're adventurers.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.730
You don't need to get upset 
just because an NPC died.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.770
The Rakurou Wolf Brigade

11:58.770 --> 12:01.350
said they were going to try to wipe 
out the nole army, right?

12:01.350 --> 12:02.240
Yes.

12:02.690 --> 12:06.100
We're going to try a ninety-six-man legion raid.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.830
We're heading for the pillar ruins 
known as Tone's Grave.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.500
That's where the nole live.

12:11.270 --> 12:12.850
There are four thousand enemies.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.440
A team of level 90 and above 
adventurers shouldn't have

12:15.440 --> 12:16.980
any problem with that.

12:16.980 --> 12:18.170
That sounds so cool.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.580
I want to go, too.

12:21.540 --> 12:25.010
We cannot leave the Corridor to Heaven behind.

12:25.350 --> 12:28.970
It's fun to hurt tokens who have 
no idea what they are.

12:29.340 --> 12:32.190
We are the same.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.320
Wiped out?

12:35.780 --> 12:38.900
The Rakurou Wolf Brigade raid team got wiped out.

12:38.990 --> 12:44.410
That layered status and a black dragon 
were seen on the battlefield.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.580
Parallel one...

12:46.580 --> 12:47.370
Kanami!

12:48.140 --> 12:51.130
A nole army is heading through 
the zone we just passed!

12:51.130 --> 12:52.080
Five hundred of them!

12:52.910 --> 12:56.750
They're heading for the village we stayed in.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.970
Noles live in caves and ruins, 
and eat those who come close.

13:02.260 --> 13:05.930
For some reason, they're moving 
en masse in search of food.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.310
Nice! Nice!

13:08.310 --> 13:10.630
Five hundred dogs is a lucky sign!

13:11.040 --> 13:13.940
You can't get this excitement in real life!

13:14.390 --> 13:15.070
Huh?

13:15.320 --> 13:18.570
No shortage of enemies! So much excitement!

13:18.860 --> 13:19.690
Huh?

13:20.310 --> 13:23.100
You don't have to say, "Huh," twice!

13:23.100 --> 13:25.840
Are you planning to defeat the nole 
army moving toward the village,

13:25.840 --> 13:28.090
and then go to Tone's Grave?

13:28.090 --> 13:29.600
That's my KR!

13:29.600 --> 13:30.860
You get it!

13:30.860 --> 13:32.080
Are you stupid?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.830
Didn't you hear how that legion 
raid was annihilated?

13:36.100 --> 13:40.020
Because they did a full-on brawl, 
with no information.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.760
So we won't do any brawling.

13:42.250 --> 13:45.340
We'll attack, kill the boss, and run.

13:45.340 --> 13:46.850
Perfect game!

13:46.850 --> 13:48.850
We are champions!

13:49.830 --> 13:51.740
So, what information do we have?

13:51.740 --> 13:53.850
We heard a lot from Chun-Lu, right?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.290
And how are we supposed to use it?

13:56.650 --> 13:58.690
You figure that out, KR.

13:59.470 --> 14:00.860
I can't!

14:01.900 --> 14:05.110
It doesn't matter whether you can do it or not...

14:05.110 --> 14:06.380
Then what does?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.740
There's a need for us to go.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.950
What do you mean "a need"?

14:12.920 --> 14:15.460
A reason I can't say aloud.

14:17.810 --> 14:21.150
Why do all this for People of the Land NPCs?

14:22.330 --> 14:24.130
I agree with Kanami.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.870
Not simply because I owe her a debt.

14:28.230 --> 14:29.550
I am a progenitor.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.720
I have had a duty to protect the People 
of the Land since the thirteen orders

14:32.720 --> 14:35.050
of knights around the world were born.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.240
<i>Yeah...</i>

14:39.240 --> 14:40.510
<i>That's right.</i>

14:40.950 --> 14:42.830
<i>He's an NPC, too.</i>

14:43.250 --> 14:45.020
<i>The same as a Person of the Land.</i>

14:45.680 --> 14:47.210
What will we do with the villagers?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.730
Chun-Lu, will you go let them know?

14:49.730 --> 14:50.800
Got it.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.330
I will go with you.

14:54.270 --> 14:55.890
We can't win!

14:56.210 --> 14:58.770
There's no reason for you to do that!

15:01.740 --> 15:05.260
I am not a player character, either.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.510
I am one of many MMORPG farming bots

15:11.050 --> 15:15.720
created by a Chinese money-laundering group.

15:27.710 --> 15:30.190
Didn't you go with Kanami and the others?

15:30.190 --> 15:32.340
Something was bothering me.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.500
After that, what did that girl tell you?

15:38.390 --> 15:40.220
She was a farming bot.

15:40.620 --> 15:41.910
Not a player.

15:41.910 --> 15:43.920
She was just an AI that

15:45.520 --> 15:46.960
only existed in the game.

15:48.810 --> 15:54.620
In that village, I healed eighteen People of the Land.

15:55.110 --> 15:58.220
I blessed forty-nine.

15:58.590 --> 16:03.860
Whether it had any effect, I don't know.

16:04.320 --> 16:11.140
I was thanked three hundred and 
nineteen times for this act.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.320
What would he do?

16:16.450 --> 16:18.180
The unbeatable ninja hero.

16:24.210 --> 16:25.360
I know what he'd do.

16:26.220 --> 16:28.360
I've known from the start.

16:29.070 --> 16:29.840
He'd go.

16:31.900 --> 16:33.310
That's interesting.

16:33.310 --> 16:35.030
Truly, truly interesting.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.330
Are you KR?

16:38.740 --> 16:42.100
<b>KR 
Race/ Elf 
Summoner, Lv. 90 
Plant Hwyaden</b>

16:40.800 --> 16:42.100
That's right.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.630
How?

16:43.630 --> 16:44.840
What did you do?

16:45.170 --> 16:48.110
Swap Teleporting. Castling.

16:48.110 --> 16:52.380
<b>Servant                                                                               Caster</b>

16:48.110 --> 16:56.120
<b>Swap Teleporting 
Castling</b>

16:48.430 --> 16:50.830
It's an emergency escape method that

16:50.830 --> 16:54.350
swaps the caster and their summoned creature.

16:52.380 --> 16:56.120
<b>Caster                                                                                 Servant</b>

16:55.010 --> 16:56.120
Which means...

16:56.610 --> 16:59.870
I just teleported to this server from Japan.

17:01.310 --> 17:02.950
I'll go with you.

17:02.950 --> 17:03.620
Why?

17:04.020 --> 17:05.440
I know

17:07.470 --> 17:10.130
that frog mask, too.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.000
I liked him.

17:13.780 --> 17:17.140
If that hero is going to show off his new power,

17:17.480 --> 17:20.270
then I have to show off mine, too.

17:21.260 --> 17:23.040
<i>Awaken, my friend,</i>

17:23.040 --> 17:24.160
<i>the red dragon!</i>

17:24.610 --> 17:27.770
<i>Awaken from thy garnet slumber 
and fly through the sky!</i>

17:34.690 --> 17:36.400
Spirits of pure water,

17:36.400 --> 17:40.410
become a thousand blades, 
and shine across the battlefield!

17:42.920 --> 17:45.870
<i>Aqua Thousand Rain!</i>

18:04.370 --> 18:05.450
Leonardo?

18:06.260 --> 18:08.290
I can see Tone's Grave from here.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.370
Wait... Hey!

18:15.290 --> 18:17.170
That's amazing.

18:17.170 --> 18:20.110
That's a full- or double-raid rank...

18:20.110 --> 18:22.240
The black dragon Chun-Lu was talking about?

18:22.770 --> 18:23.840
Someone's riding it.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.750
They're the bad guys.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.540
The boss characters, huh?

18:28.020 --> 18:30.500
Oh? More adventurers.

18:30.900 --> 18:33.060
Models without power.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.780
If it weren't for those two, could you keep

18:40.780 --> 18:42.720
the black dragon away from Coppelia and Kanami?

18:42.990 --> 18:43.750
Yeah.

18:44.130 --> 18:45.020
Perfect.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.520
Cowabunga!

18:52.560 --> 18:54.360
Froggy-nardo! That was awesome!

18:56.880 --> 18:57.790
Let's go!

19:00.730 --> 19:04.070
I'm astonished, human.

19:04.070 --> 19:05.160
My God.

19:04.890 --> 19:10.110
<b>Genius of Necromancy
Lasphere/ Genius, Lv. 89

19:06.060 --> 19:06.910
Lasphere,

19:06.910 --> 19:08.190
level 89,

19:08.190 --> 19:09.700
a normal-rank monster.

19:11.980 --> 19:19.970
<b>Genius of Healing

19:13.030 --> 19:14.290
Level 89,

normal rank.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.390
His name is Paps.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.970
So you read my name.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.790
That is the special ability of these solutions.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.580
A genius...

19:26.580 --> 19:31.110
So you know that name, survivor?

19:31.110 --> 19:31.980
Eri-Eri!

19:35.820 --> 19:37.070
They're all slippery!

19:40.010 --> 19:42.270
It is a strange combination,

19:42.270 --> 19:46.450
but I should not let the progenitor, 
or the rest of you, survive.

19:46.680 --> 19:47.780
I'll eliminate you.

19:48.660 --> 19:49.940
This is wonderful!

19:49.940 --> 19:51.340
This is joyous!

19:51.850 --> 19:52.630
Shut up!

19:57.890 --> 19:59.050
<i>Parallel One!</i>

19:59.490 --> 20:04.130
<i>She's controlling a second name, 
swapping it with her own status,</i>

20:04.130 --> 20:06.680
<i>and using it to take damage for her?</i>

20:08.600 --> 20:12.480
<i>Then I'll use the gap between 
the charge and the motion...</i>

20:13.280 --> 20:15.400
<i>Parallel Plot!</i>

20:16.900 --> 20:19.690
So this is pain? Or is this an ache?

20:20.070 --> 20:21.930
More crimson than twilight,

20:21.930 --> 20:23.570
redder than a lycoris flower!

20:26.740 --> 20:28.500
A deeper red than a rose...

20:31.400 --> 20:33.960
Did your companions fall?

20:34.180 --> 20:35.040
Stop it...

20:35.400 --> 20:37.960
Why do you not shut down?

20:37.960 --> 20:40.010
Shut your mouth!

20:40.360 --> 20:45.470
I know everything about the progenitors... 
No, about the People of the Land.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.490
You are all dolls,

20:48.490 --> 20:50.430
puppets without will,

20:50.430 --> 20:54.060
only personality software.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.100
There are no fairies.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.760
The progenitors and the People of the Land

21:01.500 --> 21:03.340
are all false.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.830
Be destroyed, false thing.

21:05.830 --> 21:09.360
You must shut down.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.750
You, who were born from nothing, 
shut down your timeline.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.750
Hell, no!

21:19.660 --> 21:20.840
Don't be stupid!

21:21.300 --> 21:22.900
Eri-Eri is real!

21:22.900 --> 21:23.930
He's right here!

21:24.440 --> 21:26.850
From now on, we're going to have a lot of fun.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.430
Don't take him away from me.

21:28.780 --> 21:32.090
You're just a tire-tube man!

21:33.140 --> 21:36.240
I don't know what happened after that.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.440
Worrying about it is a waste of time.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.940
She's as terrible as ever.

21:42.940 --> 21:46.510
I told you it's terrifying how little she's changed.

21:46.510 --> 21:48.190
Miss Nureha!

21:49.080 --> 21:49.970
Miss Nureha!

21:49.970 --> 21:52.830
Wave your hand, Lady Nureha.

21:55.890 --> 21:57.160
<i>That's right.</i>

21:57.160 --> 22:02.280
<i>You need only smile with that pretty face.</i>

22:02.920 --> 22:05.870
Did you tell Indicus this?

22:05.870 --> 22:06.950
Nope.

22:06.950 --> 22:10.600
She doesn't know that Kanami 
is back in the game, either.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.480
That will make their reunion 
even more moving, won't it?

22:23.750 --> 22:25.240
Preparing to deploy magic circles.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.750
Linked-path adjustment complete.

22:27.750 --> 22:28.620
Ready to go at will.

22:29.110 --> 22:31.150
It's time to start a war!

22:31.750 --> 22:33.850
To the East!

24:06.290 --> 24:11.500
The magic bag that holds anything, 
the thing all beginners desire.

24:12.330 --> 24:15.620
Minori and the others go on a quest 
to get the materials for it.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.800
Carrying five people,

24:17.800 --> 24:20.850
both nervous and excited about 
a world they've not yet seen,

24:20.850 --> 24:22.590
the carriage sets off.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.110
Next time: Setting Off.

24:23.230 --> 24:29.940
<b>Setting Off</b>

24:25.630 --> 24:27.500
I have friends to run with me.
