They live inside people's homes

it means he's been banished,

05:33.458 --> 05:35.585

11:24.934 --> 11:26.268
[creature munching]

11:26.352 --> 11:29.146
Hey, Tontu, look at this.
These guys look just like you.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.648
Are they nisse?

11:30.731 --> 11:32.858
I think they-- Tontu?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.569
[Tontu] I told you there'd be
someone here already.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.321
[munching continues]

11:40.324 --> 11:41.200
[growling]

11:41.784 --> 11:43.744
Hey! Those are my clothes!

11:43.828 --> 11:45.496
[roaring]

11:45.579 --> 11:48.499
[nisses grunting]

11:51.919 --> 11:53.838
[shouting, growling]

11:53.921 --> 11:55.339
[Tontu whimpering]

11:55.423 --> 11:56.924
[growls, whimpers]

11:57.007 --> 11:58.175
[Tontu shouting]

11:59.301 --> 12:01.095
[Tontu shouting]

12:01.679 --> 12:03.681
-[groans]
-[both grunting]

12:17.737 --> 12:18.863
[nisse shouts]

12:20.698 --> 12:21.782
Whoa, whoa!

12:21.866 --> 12:23.492
-[door opens]
-[Tontu whimpers]

12:24.160 --> 12:25.161
What in the--?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.831
Mum! You're not gonna believe this, but--

12:28.914 --> 12:31.500
-Get out of my house!
-[Tontu] I'm gone.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.839
Mum, wait, I know this looks bad,
but he doesn't have anywhere to live,

12:36.922 --> 12:39.216
-and I was thinking that he could--
-Not a chance!

12:46.265 --> 12:49.769
Mum, I'm really sorry.
I just wanted to help him. I thought--

12:49.852 --> 12:52.271
We'll talk about it
when you're back, okay?

12:52.354 --> 12:55.441
Maybe I'll have been able
to rebuild our kitchen by then.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.527
I hope he's all right out there.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.784
[gasps]

13:07.787 --> 13:09.580
All right, Johanna, get a grip.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.963
Have fun!

13:18.798 --> 13:19.757
Oh, hold on.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.927
-[gasps]
-[insect hissing]

13:23.511 --> 13:25.805
There, all good now. Off you go.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.727
You have a good time, okay?
I'll see you in a couple of days.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.645
I will.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.939
Don't worry.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.026
And don't do anything too fun
until I'm back!

13:41.779 --> 13:44.323
Um, uh, Raven Leader...

13:44.406 --> 13:49.829
I don't want to be an alarmist,
but is this definitely, well, safe?

13:49.912 --> 13:53.707
It's just that they haven't caught,
well, you know, um, the beast.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.668
-[nervous laugh]
-[chuckles]

13:55.751 --> 13:59.964
I understand your concerns,
but, really, there's no reason to worry.

14:00.047 --> 14:04.468
This is private Sparrow Scout property,
well inside the town walls.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.848
If there were any dangerous creatures
in these woods, I'd know all about it.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.015
[chuckles]

14:10.099 --> 14:12.268
[sighs] I tried Frida again earlier.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.853
I don't know why you bothered.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.231
She made it pretty clear
she had better things to be doing.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.190
I know.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.318
I just... I really thought
she might change her mind.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.084
-What are you doing?
-[yelps] Nothing.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.420
How did you even get in here?

14:39.503 --> 14:42.256
You're still up
for the thing tonight, right?

14:42.840 --> 14:45.134
Um, uh, well--

14:45.217 --> 14:47.177
I told everyone you were coming.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.596
If you've got other plans...

14:48.679 --> 14:51.140
No! No! Of course I'm coming.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.476
I-- I'm just, uh...
ready when you are.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.027
Now listen up, Sparrows.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.571
You're to stick with your groups.

15:05.654 --> 15:09.116
I cannot stress that enough.
I'm looking at you, Willy.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.117
Willy?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.035
Huh?

15:11.952 --> 15:13.871
Use your maps and compasses.

15:13.954 --> 15:16.749
Find your markers and be back in one hour.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.459
Right, off you go.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.088
-Willy!
-[grunting]

15:27.092 --> 15:28.719
Look! There's a marker.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.765
[boy] Looks like
we're the first ones here.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.142
They still haven't caught
that Black Hound yet.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.228
It could still totally be here right now,
stalking us!

15:38.312 --> 15:41.315
What? I thought that thing wasn't real.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.983
Yeah, that's what I heard, too.

15:43.067 --> 15:47.613
It's definitely real, but my dad says
it's probably just a lost mountain spirit.

15:47.696 --> 15:50.824
My brother says it's a demon
and it only eats girls.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.369
[girl] What kind of demon only eats girls?

15:53.452 --> 15:56.413
[boy] How should I know?
One with terrible taste, I imagine.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.749
Hey, Hilda!

15:59.625 --> 16:01.794
-Where are you going?
-Shh!

16:10.427 --> 16:12.179
[Tontu] Who's there? Show yourself!

16:12.262 --> 16:15.557
But let me tell you,
I have a branch and I will use it!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.643
What are you? Wolf? Troll?

16:19.311 --> 16:21.647
Oh, worse. It's you.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.984
Oh, and now there's two of you.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.695
What do you mean worse?
I only tried to help you.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.657
[Tontu] You got me into a fight
and then got me banished all over again.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.995
Admittedly, it didn't go incredibly well.
What are you doing out here anyway?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.455
[Tontu] I thought I wouldn't be bothered

16:38.539 --> 16:41.041
by people asking
what I was doing out here!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.334
[harrumphs]

16:45.212 --> 16:46.338
[sighs]

16:48.173 --> 16:49.425
[Tontu shouts, groans]

16:49.508 --> 16:50.342
Hey!

16:53.887 --> 16:55.514
That's better, isn't it?

16:56.306 --> 16:58.684
What's that interesting sculpture, Tontu?

16:59.476 --> 17:00.936
[Tontu] That's my tent.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.313
All right,
so I'm not very good at camping.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.774
I'm headed back to town tomorrow anyway.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.276
I miss houses.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.571
-What was your house like?
-[Tontu] It was a big, yellow house.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.658
It had a big garden and a duck pond
with a duck that I really liked.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.951
That sounds lovely.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.955
I wish I knew a duck that I liked.
They all want to peck my fingers.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.416
[Tontu] I wish I could just go back there.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.834
-[Raven Leader] David!
-[gasps]

17:24.501 --> 17:27.254
-[Raven Leader] Hilda!
-[sighs] We'd better go.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.590
Listen. You must be hungry, right?

17:29.673 --> 17:31.425
I have more snacks and food
back in my tent

17:31.508 --> 17:34.011
than a human or nisse
could possibly ever eat.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.889
-We can sneak out and bring you some.
-We can?

17:36.972 --> 17:37.848
Come on, David.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.855
Hilda! David!

17:45.355 --> 17:46.523
Oh, there you are!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.442
We were just looking for you.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.319
-Ah!
-Shh!

18:32.402 --> 18:33.570
You're gonna wake everyone!

18:34.279 --> 18:37.282
This is a bad idea.
If we get caught--

18:37.366 --> 18:40.994
We'll only get caught if someone hears
you worrying about getting caught.

18:41.078 --> 18:41.912
Come on!

19:00.389 --> 19:04.226
Are you sure this is the right way?
We've been walking for ages.

19:04.309 --> 19:10.649
Um, I think I'm sort of,
mostly, kind of sure-ish?

19:10.732 --> 19:13.777
Look, that's Tontu's fire! Obviously.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.445
I told you I was sure.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.156
[whimpers]

19:17.239 --> 19:19.408
[girl] And then I freeze her to the spot.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.035
She can't move. And then along comes...

19:22.119 --> 19:23.245
David, flashlight.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.246
What?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.372
Just turn it off.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.583
Okay.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.627
[girl]
But when Mom turns around, surprise!

19:30.711 --> 19:31.962
It's not her mom at all.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.214
It's a big pile of boiled eggs!

19:34.298 --> 19:35.591
And she hates boiled eggs.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.135
And they all crack,
and each one has her face inside.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.679
And then suddenly...
[gasps] ...she's an egg.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.930
Frida?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.473
[laughing]

19:43.557 --> 19:47.186
So then, I made his arms
turn into a pair of snakes,

19:47.269 --> 19:50.355
and he was trying to run away
from himself all night.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.940
[all laughing]

19:52.024 --> 19:56.570
Until, that is,
I turned his legs into snakes as well!

19:56.653 --> 19:58.697
[cackling]

20:02.826 --> 20:04.828
[coughing]

20:07.956 --> 20:09.625
I can't believe this.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.838
I knew there was something about Kelly.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.131
She's a marra!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.674
This isn't what Frida's like.

20:18.175 --> 20:21.094
They must have done something to her.
We've got to save her.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.597
She doesn't look like
she needs saving to me.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.099
David?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.602
David!

20:28.685 --> 20:29.937
[girl 2] All right, all right.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.855
Listen to this, ladies.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.774
I was nightmaring this girl last night.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.902
I started out with a basic turn-around,
you know, a lost kind of deal.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.989
So she doesn't know where she is,
and then I freeze her to the spot.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.532
I'm done!

20:42.616 --> 20:45.786
Why would you be friends with them?
Doesn't she remember?

20:45.869 --> 20:47.496
[leaves rustling]

20:47.579 --> 20:50.207
Oh, no. I left our flipping flashlight.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.209
[leaves rustling]

20:52.292 --> 20:53.126
[David gasps]

20:53.210 --> 20:54.378
Hilda?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.088
[David] The... The...

20:56.171 --> 20:57.839
The Black Hound!

20:57.923 --> 21:00.175
[whimpering, panting]

21:01.009 --> 21:02.052
[groans]

21:02.135 --> 21:03.428
[panting]

21:04.263 --> 21:05.931
[screaming]

21:06.515 --> 21:07.391
David!

21:12.020 --> 21:14.398
I should have known
you guys would turn up.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.693
David! Hilda! What are you doing here?

21:17.776 --> 21:20.279
[panting] The Black Hound, it's coming!

21:20.362 --> 21:23.031
We've got to run.
It was right behind me. It's...

21:26.076 --> 21:26.910
[croaks]

21:29.454 --> 21:31.915
Oh, boy, do I have some stories
to tell about this kid.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.917
[laughing]

21:34.001 --> 21:36.044
He's the easiest scare I ever had.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.879
Back off! I don't know what's going on,

21:37.963 --> 21:40.424
but we're taking our friend
and getting out of here.

21:40.507 --> 21:41.508
Come on, Frida.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.852
[Kelly] Why don't you back off?
Frida's hanging out with us right now.

21:51.935 --> 21:54.479
And you know what? She's having fun.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.233
In fact, at this rate, she might make
a pretty good marra one day.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.527
Frida, I don't get it.

22:00.610 --> 22:03.655
I understand if you don't want
to hang out with me anymore,

22:03.739 --> 22:05.907
but why would you hang out with them?

22:05.991 --> 22:07.451
You're my best friend.

22:07.951 --> 22:10.912
You always looked out for me
when I was scared.

22:11.705 --> 22:16.877
But I'm not scared now,
especially not scared of you!

22:17.794 --> 22:18.628
[growls]

22:18.712 --> 22:24.051
What's scary about a sad bunch of creeps
with nothing better to do

22:24.134 --> 22:29.848
than sit around being nasty
about people behind their back?

22:29.931 --> 22:31.767
[creature growling]

22:34.603 --> 22:36.605
[growling]

22:38.273 --> 22:39.399
Uh-oh.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.276
[beast roars]

22:42.027 --> 22:43.904
[theme music playing]
