JACK:
 <i>That's hyocine-pentothal.</i>

00:14.633 --> 00:17.267
 <i>You will experience a pain</i>
 <i>I can't even describe.</i>

00:17.334 --> 00:19.967
At 8cc's, I run the risk
of inducing heart attack.

00:20.034 --> 00:21.501
Four cc's!

00:21.568 --> 00:22.667
That's 8cc's total, Jack.

00:22.733 --> 00:24.334
His vitals are spiking
across the line.

00:24.401 --> 00:25.134
Four cc's!

00:25.201 --> 00:26.733
(screaming)

00:26.800 --> 00:29.867
The connection you found
between Dad and Gredenko

00:29.934 --> 00:33.101
had to do with a contract
that was awarded to us.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.201
What did an ex-Russian general
have to do with the contract?

00:35.267 --> 00:39.633
It was his job to release
the old nukes...

00:39.700 --> 00:41.167
into the U.S.
for decommissioning.

00:41.234 --> 00:43.301
He knows you didn't
tell him everything.

00:43.367 --> 00:45.167
Yeah, and I won't.
You know I won't, Dad.

00:45.234 --> 00:46.434
Have to be sure.

00:46.501 --> 00:49.867
(muffled grunting)

00:49.934 --> 00:52.034
(muffled screaming)

00:56.667 --> 00:58.501
I would like you

00:58.568 --> 01:00.600
to appear on television
and appeal to members

01:00.667 --> 01:02.334
of Islamic communities
everywhere

01:02.401 --> 01:05.301
to come forward with
any information regarding Fayed.

01:05.367 --> 01:07.967
 <i>I certainly can't</i>
 <i>reach out to them for help,</i>

01:08.034 --> 01:09.267
but I know you can.

01:09.334 --> 01:11.167
Fayed has already
called me a traitor.

01:11.234 --> 01:12.867
And many others will follow him

01:12.934 --> 01:15.667
if there is even a suspicion
that I am an American puppet!

01:15.733 --> 01:17.201
Not a puppet, a partner.

01:17.267 --> 01:19.534
At least when it comes to
finding these nuclear weapons.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.834
The President just rejected
every one of my proposals.

01:23.900 --> 01:26.700
REED:
 <i>A change in leadership</i>
 <i>is imperative to ensure</i>

01:26.767 --> 01:28.501
this nation's security.

01:28.568 --> 01:30.733
I'm not talking about
holding hearings.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.034
Something more... immediate

01:33.101 --> 01:34.201
would have
to happen.

01:34.267 --> 01:35.468
This is the engineer?

01:35.534 --> 01:36.633
You've got the wrong man.

01:36.700 --> 01:37.867
(grunts)

01:37.934 --> 01:40.501
FAYED:
 <i>You're going to modify this</i>

01:40.568 --> 01:42.867
so that I can use it
to reprogram the bombs.

01:42.934 --> 01:43.900
You will do it.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.534
The question is

01:45.600 --> 01:47.501
 <i>how much pain will be inflicted</i>
 <i>on you before you comply.</i>

01:47.568 --> 01:48.501
(Morris screaming)

01:48.568 --> 01:50.067
(gasping, screaming)

01:51.234 --> 01:52.067
Stop!

01:53.633 --> 01:54.501
I'll do it.

01:58.468 --> 01:59.401
Arm it.

02:03.301 --> 02:05.568
Very good.

02:08.934 --> 02:10.434
(pumps shotgun)

02:11.568 --> 02:12.967
TURNER:
Fayed's already gone.

02:13.034 --> 02:15.700
The reprogramming device that
Fayed had me build for him,

02:15.767 --> 02:18.134
if it's not here, it means
he took it with him.

02:18.201 --> 02:19.367
And with it,

02:19.434 --> 02:21.267
 <i>he can activate</i>
 <i>the other bombs he has</i>

02:21.334 --> 02:22.800
 <i>anytime he wants.</i>

02:28.934 --> 02:30.900
(helicopter rotors whirring)

03:00.867 --> 03:03.468
* *

03:12.900 --> 03:14.900
(phone ringing)

03:14.967 --> 03:16.067
Yes?

03:16.134 --> 03:17.301
FAYED:
I have the arming device.

03:17.367 --> 03:20.167
But I had to leave
one of the suitcases behind.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.900
What happened?

03:21.967 --> 03:23.834
CTU found me.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.867
I needed to preoccupy them
with a bomb to enable my escape.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.434
The delivery system software

03:29.501 --> 03:32.167
was programmed
for five detonations

03:32.234 --> 03:34.800
at five high-priority targets.

03:34.867 --> 03:38.501
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

03:38.568 --> 03:41.501
More than enough for
our needs, Gredenko.

03:41.568 --> 03:44.800
You just make sure the delivery
system arrives on schedule.

03:44.867 --> 03:48.468
The trucks have left Nevada,

03:48.534 --> 03:50.934
and they'll reach the location
within two hours.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.134
Good.

03:52.201 --> 03:53.600
You can use the time you have

03:53.667 --> 03:55.568
to reprogram
your targeting software.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.301
Call me when it's completed.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.334
(vehicle engine starts)

04:07.633 --> 04:09.367
Since the FAA
was unable to track

04:09.434 --> 04:11.900
Fayed's chopper, we have to
assume it set down somewhere

04:11.967 --> 04:13.733
outside the containment area.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.167
We may not know
where Fayed is,

04:15.234 --> 04:17.233
but we do know he's in
possession of a device

04:17.301 --> 04:18.867
that will enable
him to activate

04:18.934 --> 04:21.067
the three remaining suitcase
nukes in his arsenal.

04:21.134 --> 04:24.167
Our only potential lead
was uploaded

04:24.234 --> 04:25.600
from the hard drive of a laptop

04:25.667 --> 04:27.234
recovered at the scene
by Jack Bauer and his team.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.700
Milo.

04:28.767 --> 04:31.600
There was an e-mail fragment
I was able to restore

04:31.667 --> 04:33.401
from the computer's hard drive;
it made reference to

04:33.468 --> 04:36.800
recent communications between
Fayed and Dmitri Gredenko.

04:36.867 --> 04:40.034
Gredenko is the former
Soviet general in charge

04:40.101 --> 04:43.401
of turning over Russian nukes
to the U.S. for decommission.

04:43.468 --> 04:45.434
Ultimately, he was the source of
the weapons Fayed now possesses.

04:45.501 --> 04:47.468
So, clearly, Gredenko's
more involved in this

04:47.534 --> 04:49.201
than we realized.

04:49.267 --> 04:50.367
What's his interest
in helping Fayed?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.067
Gredenko's an ultranationalist.

04:53.134 --> 04:55.401
His desire to harm this country,
economically and otherwise,

04:55.468 --> 04:56.667
is in sync with Fayed's.

04:56.733 --> 04:58.767
Have we gotten any updated intel
on his location?

04:58.834 --> 04:59.800
BUCHANAN:
Interpol just confirmed

04:59.867 --> 05:01.434
he's no longer in Moscow.

05:01.501 --> 05:02.934
Since the point
of origin

05:03.000 --> 05:04.934
fingerprint on the
e-mail fragment

05:05.000 --> 05:07.201
was Pacific time,
I think it's safe to assume

05:07.267 --> 05:10.534
he's somewhere on the West
Coast, possibly Los Angeles.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.201
Chloe, run a data sweep through
INS and customs channels.

05:12.267 --> 05:14.867
See if we can track
how he got in the country.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.667
(sighs softly)

05:30.534 --> 05:31.600
Morris.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.201
We have to take
him to Medical.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.267
I just want to talk
to him for a minute.

05:35.334 --> 05:36.234
Are you okay?

05:36.301 --> 05:38.301
Give us ten minutes.

06:01.534 --> 06:02.800
Bill.
Jack.

06:02.867 --> 06:04.667
We able to pull anything
off the hard drive we found?

06:04.733 --> 06:06.267
We have.

06:06.334 --> 06:07.934
Apparently, Fayed's been in
contact with Dmitri Gredenko.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.501
Gredenko?

06:09.568 --> 06:10.767
It's looking
more and more like

06:10.834 --> 06:11.900
he's been aiding
Fayed's operation all along.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.434
You think he's here
in Los Angeles.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.468
Evidence on the hard
drive points to that.

06:15.534 --> 06:16.934
What leads do you have
on Gredenko?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Your father's company
was contracted

06:19.067 --> 06:20.267
to dispose of the nukes

06:20.334 --> 06:21.401
Gredenko was
to hand over.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.967
My brother Graem
oversaw those contracts,

06:23.034 --> 06:24.101
not my father.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.534
He still might have
some information.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.600
Okay, fine, I'll talk to him.

06:26.667 --> 06:27.767
Where is he?

06:27.834 --> 06:28.867
He went to see
your brother's body

06:28.934 --> 06:31.600
in the morgue.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.367
Okay, thanks.

06:35.401 --> 06:38.167
Chloe, you all right?

06:38.234 --> 06:39.733
Yeah.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.900
Thank you for saving
Morris's life.

06:41.967 --> 06:43.367
Yeah.

06:43.434 --> 06:47.000
I'm really glad Fayed didn't
kill you this morning.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.967
Me, too.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.334
I have to talk
to my father.

06:52.401 --> 06:54.834
I... just want to thank you

06:54.900 --> 06:56.367
for everything.

07:37.234 --> 07:40.234
* *

08:14.301 --> 08:16.201
Dad.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.201
Whatever your brother
may have done,

08:22.267 --> 08:25.134
he didn't deserve this.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.301
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

08:31.800 --> 08:32.767
Yeah.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.633
Well...

08:37.501 --> 08:40.067
Dad, I'm sorry about Graem.

08:40.134 --> 08:41.700
I am.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.933
But right now,
CTU wants to know about

08:44.000 --> 08:46.034
your connection
to Dmitri Gredenko.

08:51.034 --> 08:52.101
What?

08:52.167 --> 08:53.468
We believe that
he's working with Fayed.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.301
They want to know
what you know about him.

08:55.367 --> 08:58.667
He was the Russian liaison

08:58.733 --> 09:01.501
on our government contract to
decommission Soviet nukes. Why?

09:01.568 --> 09:03.101
What kind of dealings
did <i>you</i> have with him?

09:03.167 --> 09:06.667
Couple of phone calls to
Moscow, that's about it.

09:06.733 --> 09:08.568
Do you know of any contacts
that Gredenko might have

09:08.633 --> 09:10.501
which would allow Fayed to move
the remaining four nukes?

09:10.568 --> 09:13.967
Look, Jack, like I told you,

09:14.034 --> 09:16.334
I had virtually no involvement.

09:16.401 --> 09:19.934
Graem oversaw the project,
he dealt with Gredenko.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.934
Whatever you need to know
died with him.

09:26.401 --> 09:27.468
You know where Marilyn is?

09:27.534 --> 09:29.733
No.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.767
Why?

09:30.834 --> 09:32.267
You gonna question her, too?

09:38.733 --> 09:41.101
She's probably with Josh.

09:41.167 --> 09:42.201
He's taking the death

09:42.267 --> 09:45.867
of his father
pretty hard.

09:45.934 --> 09:48.568
Leave them
alone, Jack.

09:48.633 --> 09:52.267
Let them grieve
in peace.

09:52.334 --> 09:55.800
I'll make a call to some
of the company executives.

09:55.867 --> 09:58.401
About Gredenko.

09:58.468 --> 10:02.468
Maybe Graem shared something
that I wasn't privy to.

10:07.067 --> 10:08.034
Thank you.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.234
DOCTOR:
Try to rest.

10:28.301 --> 10:29.334
You're doing
very well.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.767
You can go in now.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.733
Morris?

10:44.800 --> 10:45.834
How are you feeling?

10:51.834 --> 10:53.600
Say something.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.767
What is there to say?

10:57.834 --> 10:59.568
You were tortured.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.767
You held out as
long as you could.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.900
I armed a nuclear bomb.

11:04.967 --> 11:05.900
You had to.

11:05.967 --> 11:06.934
Fayed was gonna kill you.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.434
I wish to God he had.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.367
Because of me,

11:10.434 --> 11:12.600
Fayed has a device that can
arm all the bloody

11:12.667 --> 11:14.534
suitcase nukes
he wants.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.733
You can't blame yourself.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.767
When the next bomb goes off, and
thousands of more people die,

11:19.834 --> 11:21.534
everybody will remember

11:21.600 --> 11:24.401
that I was the one
that made it possible.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.267
That's not
gonna happen.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.334
'Cause we're gonna find Fayed
and we're gonna stop him,

11:30.401 --> 11:31.568
and none of this
will matter.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.501
Are you any closer
to finding him?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.267
No.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.234
Just go, darling.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.334
Go.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.034
(phone rings)

12:09.101 --> 12:10.501
Yes, Mr. Bauer?

12:10.568 --> 12:13.134
We've got a problem.
Gredenko's here.

12:13.201 --> 12:15.134
In L.A.?

12:15.201 --> 12:16.568
Are you sure?
Yes.

12:16.633 --> 12:17.934
Only, they don't
know where he is.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.034
We've got to get to him
before they do.

12:20.101 --> 12:23.900
If Gredenko
implicates me, everything--

12:23.967 --> 12:27.401
the company I founded
and spent my life protecting--

12:27.468 --> 12:28.633
it's over,
you understand?

12:28.700 --> 12:30.468
Yes. I'll put a
team together.

12:30.534 --> 12:32.800
I'll monitor
CTU from here.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.568
If I hear of anything,
I'll call you.

12:34.633 --> 12:36.267
Yes, sir.
I don't care

12:36.334 --> 12:38.067
what you have to do.

12:38.134 --> 12:40.367
You find Gredenko,
and you kill him.

12:40.434 --> 12:42.000
Understood.

12:51.067 --> 12:53.600
I talked to my father
about Gredenko.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.834
He said he'd make
some inquiries, but I
think it's a dead end.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.334
He doesn't
know anything.

12:57.401 --> 12:58.967
The news from here
isn't much better.

12:59.034 --> 13:00.301
But Milo managed to trace

13:00.367 --> 13:02.267
the fragment he pulled off
Fayed's computer

13:02.334 --> 13:04.034
to a local I.P. network.

13:04.101 --> 13:05.867
It confirms Gredenko is
definitely here in L.A.

13:05.934 --> 13:09.167
I've got my people
monitoring chatter,

13:09.234 --> 13:11.434
data-mining
interagency backlogs

13:11.501 --> 13:13.867
on Gredenko's activities
prior to going underground.

13:13.934 --> 13:16.134
Right now,
that's all we can do.
Okay.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.733
Have a seat, Jack.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.334
What is it?

13:23.401 --> 13:25.667
It's the toxicology report
on your brother's body.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.501
Forensic evidence indicates that

13:30.568 --> 13:32.201
the hyocine-pentathol
you administered to Graem

13:32.267 --> 13:35.234
during his interrogation
caused his coronary.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.334
There's something else.

13:39.401 --> 13:41.167
I saw the field tape,

13:41.234 --> 13:44.501
and Rick Burke's
report for Division.

13:44.568 --> 13:47.167
He said you exceeded protocols,

13:47.234 --> 13:48.434
even after he warned you

13:48.501 --> 13:50.900
of dangerous levels.
That's true.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.234
Agent Burke tried to warn me.

13:52.301 --> 13:54.134
Then you pulled
a gun on him.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.534
You must realize
how this looks, Jack.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.468
Coming right after your
brother tried to kill you.
I lost control.

14:01.534 --> 14:03.401
Because you found out he was
responsible for David Palmer's

14:03.468 --> 14:05.134
assassination.
Yes, because I found out

14:05.201 --> 14:06.934
about David Palmer's
assassination.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.867
'Cause I found out
about everything.

14:09.934 --> 14:13.534
I lost control.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.534
I tried to tell you I didn't
think I could do this.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.067
 <i>This</i> job.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.101
I wanted to kill my brother.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.468
I wanted him dead.

14:25.534 --> 14:27.900
I was standing over him...

14:27.967 --> 14:32.067
and I looked up and I saw
my father in the doorway...

14:32.134 --> 14:35.267
and everything just stopped.

14:36.867 --> 14:40.101
I ordered Agent Burke
to shut down the IV, he did.

14:41.633 --> 14:44.267
I thought we caught it in time.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.067
Bill, I did not set out...

14:56.134 --> 14:58.600
to kill my brother.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.800
I swear to you.

15:14.434 --> 15:15.867
I can adjust the report

15:15.934 --> 15:18.534
before I send it
to Division.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.534
No.
Jack...

15:20.600 --> 15:22.034
an Internal Affairs
investigation

15:22.101 --> 15:23.800
will impede our search
for Fayed and Gredenko.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.401
Right now, you are
critical to that.

15:25.468 --> 15:28.201
You cannot cover this up.

15:28.267 --> 15:29.633
I ordered Agent Burke

15:29.700 --> 15:31.434
to administer
the hyocine-pentathol.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.900
I killed my brother.

15:39.967 --> 15:42.501
Whatever the consequences are,
I accept them.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.568
Bill...

15:47.633 --> 15:49.967
do this right.

15:56.034 --> 15:58.733
Okay.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.234
--I'll submit the report as is.

16:17.501 --> 16:19.968
--There is some difficulty
with my statement?

16:21.434 --> 16:22.834
A little more emphasis
on religion,

16:22.901 --> 16:24.667
and less on politics
than I expected.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.200
Many of the people
you wish me to sway

16:27.267 --> 16:29.567
have been persuaded
that our cause is a holy one.

16:29.634 --> 16:33.133
I am not innocent
in this manipulation.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.667
So I must address them
in these terms

16:34.734 --> 16:37.200
if I am to enlist
their cooperation.

16:37.267 --> 16:40.000
(knocking on glass)
Yes?

16:40.067 --> 16:42.567
Excuse me, sir.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.400
Vice President Daniels
is calling for you.

16:44.467 --> 16:47.067
Would you like to take
it in your office?

16:47.133 --> 16:48.734
No, I'll take it in here.

16:48.801 --> 16:50.767
Thank you.

16:51.501 --> 16:53.534
Excuse me.

17:00.534 --> 17:02.033
Noah?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.968
Thank you for taking my call,
Mr. President.

17:04.032 --> 17:05.400
I know you're pressed for time.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.334
What can I do for you?
I'll get right to my point.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.901
I've made no secret
of my disappointment

17:09.968 --> 17:12.467
that you rejected
Tom Lennox's plan
for mass internment

17:12.534 --> 17:14.334
of Arab nationals
in our country.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.032
The plan did not delineate
country of origin, Noah.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.800
It was nothing more than
a blanket proposal

17:18.867 --> 17:20.067
to arrest and detain

17:20.133 --> 17:22.032
thousands of Muslims
living here,

17:22.099 --> 17:23.934
without due process
I might add.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.267
Be that as it may, since,
as I understand it,

17:26.334 --> 17:27.968
the terrorists
have now acquired

17:28.032 --> 17:30.868
the capability to arm
the three remaining
nuclear weapons,

17:30.934 --> 17:33.701
I'm asking you
to reconsider.

17:33.767 --> 17:35.167
And I thought
I told you that

17:35.234 --> 17:37.033
my decision was not
open for debate.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.734
Well, that's unfortunate,
Mr. President,

17:38.801 --> 17:40.734
since the majority
of your Cabinet feels

17:40.801 --> 17:43.033
that you're making
a tragic mistake.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.033
I respect that.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.367
But I firmly believe

17:46.434 --> 17:48.267
that our best
chance of stopping

17:48.334 --> 17:50.067
further attacks will come
from the intelligence

17:50.133 --> 17:52.601
drawn from Islamic communities.

17:54.300 --> 17:58.801
And you hope to obtain that
by letting a known terrorist

17:58.868 --> 18:02.000
leader address the world
on American airwaves.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.501
The man has murdered

18:04.567 --> 18:07.567
countless innocents
over the past 20 years,

18:07.634 --> 18:09.334
and you are putting your hopes

18:09.400 --> 18:11.667
for this country's
safety on him.

18:11.734 --> 18:14.767
Not entirely...
but to the extent

18:14.834 --> 18:16.467
that he can help us, yes.

18:19.234 --> 18:22.734
Mr. President...

18:22.801 --> 18:24.701
you approached me to be your
running mate because you knew

18:24.767 --> 18:27.701
I could deliver voters
who questioned your...

18:27.767 --> 18:30.868
experience,
who were afraid

18:30.934 --> 18:33.033
that your Presidency
would be too weak

18:33.100 --> 18:34.501
on national defense,

18:34.567 --> 18:38.300
and I... assured them
otherwise, but now

18:38.367 --> 18:42.000
you're proving them right.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.000
There's a thin line between

18:44.067 --> 18:45.801
conviction and stubbornness.

18:45.868 --> 18:48.467
You can stand firm,
but just know that...

18:48.534 --> 18:51.334
you're standing alone.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.734
Are we done?

18:52.801 --> 18:54.968
Clearly.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.334
You are paying a very high price

19:07.400 --> 19:08.734
for doing this.

19:08.801 --> 19:11.234
Not as high as my country
will pay if I'm wrong.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.100
As someone who has
alienated followers

19:14.167 --> 19:16.334
by choosing
the unpopular course,

19:16.400 --> 19:18.934
I suggest you tread carefully
among your people.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.601
Mr. Assad, our cultures
are very different, sir.

19:23.667 --> 19:27.334
It's not just a cultural
issue, Mr. President.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.767
It's simple
human nature.

19:30.834 --> 19:33.267
They will come after you.

19:33.334 --> 19:35.300
I assure you of that.

20:05.667 --> 20:08.234
You sure it's safe
to talk in here?

20:08.300 --> 20:09.901
Yes, this area is
currently unmonitored.

20:09.968 --> 20:13.067
All right.

20:13.133 --> 20:15.567
You intimated you had some
sort of plan of dealing

20:15.634 --> 20:17.734
with the President.

20:17.801 --> 20:21.000
Palmer's refusal to implement

20:21.067 --> 20:22.501
your proposals will

20:22.567 --> 20:24.100
unquestionably lead
to the loss

20:24.167 --> 20:26.400
of many more American lives.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.267
And I, and many others like me

20:28.334 --> 20:30.834
who love this country,
will not

20:30.901 --> 20:34.400
stand by idly
and let that happen.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.467
So what is it you propose?

20:36.534 --> 20:38.734
I think you know.

20:38.801 --> 20:41.234
I need to hear.

20:43.834 --> 20:45.567
Definitive action.

20:47.167 --> 20:48.701
We are in the middle
of a national crisis

20:48.767 --> 20:50.534
and he is in over his head.

20:50.601 --> 20:52.567
He's brought
this on himself.

20:59.934 --> 21:02.534
Listen, before you start
reconsidering

21:02.601 --> 21:05.300
and report me, just know

21:05.367 --> 21:08.868
I will deny that we
ever had this conversation.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.000
I'm not...

21:13.067 --> 21:16.067
I'm not
reconsidering.

21:16.133 --> 21:18.133
I know what you're saying
is necessary, I just...

21:18.200 --> 21:21.534
cannot believe it has
come to this.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.000
Who else is involved?

21:29.067 --> 21:31.334
You don't need to know that.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.701
I'd like to know
who I'm dealing with.

21:32.767 --> 21:35.234
Right now you're
dealing with me.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.567
Vice President Daniels,
is he involved?

21:37.634 --> 21:39.133
No.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.734
The vice president doesn't
know anything about this.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.934
But we do know that he
shares our sentiment

21:44.000 --> 21:45.534
in regard to the current

21:45.601 --> 21:47.868
state of affairs,
and that he will

21:47.934 --> 21:51.634
enact your initiatives
once he has the power to do so.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.067
You seem pretty certain
this is going to work.

21:55.133 --> 21:57.734
More so with your help.

21:59.501 --> 22:01.701
I need the President's
itinerary.

22:01.767 --> 22:03.901
Specifically, in regards

22:03.968 --> 22:06.033
to Assad's televised address.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.501
I do not have
the proper clearance.

22:07.567 --> 22:08.968
I need you to access it.

22:09.033 --> 22:10.868
Why? W-why do you need this?

22:12.901 --> 22:14.701
Damn it, Reed.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.434
We're talking about
removing the President

22:17.501 --> 22:19.133
of the United States.
Do not keep me

22:19.200 --> 22:20.601
in the dark here.
I never said

22:20.667 --> 22:22.267
that I was
the architect of this.

22:22.334 --> 22:24.801
I'm just a conduit.

22:24.868 --> 22:27.400
Besides, for your sake, I think
that it is very important

22:27.467 --> 22:29.000
that we maintain
a certain level

22:29.067 --> 22:30.767
of plausible deniability.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.467
The less you know,
the better.

22:40.133 --> 22:42.534
I'll get you that itinerary.

23:04.734 --> 23:06.534
--Marilyn.

23:06.601 --> 23:08.167
Hi.

23:08.233 --> 23:11.767
I heard you were with Josh,
I didn't want to disturb you.

23:11.834 --> 23:13.767
Yeah, well, he's taking it

23:13.834 --> 23:15.601
pretty hard.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.634
He loved his
father very much.

23:17.701 --> 23:19.867
I'm very sorry.

23:19.934 --> 23:22.367
You don't owe me an apology.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.934
Maybe they haven't told you
the circumstances

23:25.001 --> 23:26.500
of Graem's heart attack.

23:26.567 --> 23:28.034
They told me enough.

23:29.767 --> 23:34.068
Look, Jack, I know the kind
of man Graem was.

23:34.133 --> 23:36.968
Even if he did die because
of your interrogation,

23:37.034 --> 23:38.167
I don't blame you.

23:38.233 --> 23:39.934
I blame him.

23:42.001 --> 23:46.434
The truth is, I've been trying
to leave Graem for years.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.334
But he threatened
to take Josh away from me.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.601
Said I'd never see him again.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.968
Did Josh know
what he was like?

23:54.034 --> 23:55.667
No.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.467
I always tried to protect him
from the truth

23:58.534 --> 23:59.834
about his father.

23:59.901 --> 24:02.068
What have you told him
about his father's death?

24:02.133 --> 24:04.834
Only that he had a heart attack.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.133
That's enough for now.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.200
Yeah.

24:09.267 --> 24:13.100
I'm sorry, I have to go
back to work.

24:14.667 --> 24:16.901
If there's anything
I can do.

24:16.968 --> 24:20.034
Is it true there are more bombs

24:20.133 --> 24:21.634
out there?

24:21.701 --> 24:23.334
Yes.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.233
Are you any closer
to finding them?

24:25.300 --> 24:27.734
No, we've hit a road block.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.034
Right now we're looking
for a Russian operative

24:30.100 --> 24:31.601
who we believe is helping
the terrorists.

24:31.667 --> 24:32.767
Graem knew him.

24:32.834 --> 24:34.001
Russian?

24:34.068 --> 24:36.701
A man named Gredenko.

24:36.767 --> 24:38.734
You know him?

24:38.801 --> 24:41.500
No.

24:46.001 --> 24:48.068
Come here.

24:59.167 --> 25:00.767
But you know something.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.667
Maybe.

25:02.734 --> 25:03.734
It was probably nothing.

25:03.801 --> 25:05.100
It was months ago.

25:05.167 --> 25:07.500
Marilyn, anything you
can tell us might help.

25:07.567 --> 25:12.701
Graem was going out
a lot at night,

25:12.767 --> 25:15.100
and, uh, he said
it was work related,

25:15.167 --> 25:16.567
but I didn't believe him.

25:16.634 --> 25:18.801
I thought he was having
an affair on me,

25:18.867 --> 25:20.901
so one night I followed him.

25:20.968 --> 25:24.100
It wasn't out
of jealousy.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.701
It was... it was
for leverage.

25:25.767 --> 25:28.567
Anything I could use against him
to get custody of Josh

25:28.634 --> 25:30.133
if I left him.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.233
Where did he go?

25:31.300 --> 25:34.001
It was to a house in West L.A.

25:34.068 --> 25:36.068
I went to the window.

25:36.133 --> 25:37.467
The blinds were drawn,

25:37.534 --> 25:40.667
but I could hear him inside
talking to some men.

25:40.734 --> 25:42.167
They had Russian accents.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.834
What were they saying?

25:43.901 --> 25:46.001
I couldn't hear them
clearly enough,

25:46.068 --> 25:48.233
and frankly, once I realized
he wasn't cheating on me,

25:48.300 --> 25:49.867
I got in the car
and went home.

25:49.934 --> 25:52.233
Do you remember the
address of the house?

25:52.300 --> 25:53.934
No. Jack, I'm sorry,

25:54.001 --> 25:55.934
I wasn't paying attention,
I was more concerned

25:56.001 --> 25:57.400
about getting caught.

25:57.467 --> 25:59.901
Marilyn, it is vital that
we find this man Gredenko.

25:59.968 --> 26:03.133
If we retrace the route
that you took that night,

26:03.200 --> 26:05.034
do you think that you would
recognize the house?

26:05.100 --> 26:07.167
Maybe.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.834
Maybe?

26:09.867 --> 26:12.068
Yeah.

26:12.133 --> 26:15.167
Yeah. I think so.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.001
Wait right here.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.834
Jack.

26:37.901 --> 26:39.968
I think I might have
a lead on Gredenko.

26:40.034 --> 26:42.034
It's a real shot
in the dark,

26:42.100 --> 26:43.834
but right now
we don't have anything.

26:43.901 --> 26:46.500
I wanted to know if I had your
permission to follow it up.

26:46.567 --> 26:49.034
What do you got?

26:51.100 --> 26:54.500
Hey, Marilyn.

26:54.567 --> 26:56.001
Hey, Phillip.
How you doing?

26:56.068 --> 26:58.634
I'm hanging in there.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.734
What's going on with you
and Jack?

27:01.801 --> 27:04.734
He's looking for someone.

27:04.801 --> 27:06.001
He thinks I can help.

27:06.068 --> 27:08.034
You mean Gredenko?

27:08.100 --> 27:12.034
He questioned me about
the same thing earlier.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.834
What do you know
about him?

27:14.901 --> 27:16.567
Nothing really.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.667
I followed Graem
to a house one night.

27:18.734 --> 27:20.867
He, um, he met

27:20.934 --> 27:22.934
with some Russians.
What house?

27:23.001 --> 27:24.467
I don't know.

27:24.534 --> 27:26.068
It was in West L.A.

27:26.133 --> 27:28.500
Jack wants to take me
over there

27:28.567 --> 27:31.434
to see if it can
jog my memory.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.334
Phillip,

27:33.400 --> 27:35.434
I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.901
And I can't leave
Josh alone.

27:39.968 --> 27:41.701
Could you please stay with him?

27:41.767 --> 27:44.400
Yeah, sure.

27:47.367 --> 27:48.500
Thanks.

27:48.567 --> 27:49.734
Your Tac team's
assembling outside.

27:49.801 --> 27:51.801
I'm sending Milo
along with you.

27:51.867 --> 27:53.300
Milo? Why?
I want a
tech available

27:53.367 --> 27:54.534
to pull intel
off any computers

27:54.601 --> 27:56.567
we might find at
Gredenko's location.

27:56.634 --> 27:58.601
Chloe will be running
point from here.

27:58.667 --> 27:59.901
Okay, fine.

27:59.968 --> 28:01.934
I'm sorry about leaving
you, sweetheart.

28:02.001 --> 28:03.068
But I'll be back

28:03.133 --> 28:04.701
as soon as I'm done
helping Uncle Jack.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.934
Helping him with what?

28:07.001 --> 28:09.200
Where are you going?

28:09.267 --> 28:11.767
I'll explain later.

28:11.834 --> 28:13.934
Right now I want you
to stay here

28:14.001 --> 28:15.434
with your grandfather,
all right?

28:15.500 --> 28:16.834
Marilyn.

28:24.500 --> 28:27.467
I was thinking maybe I would
take Josh back to my house.

28:27.534 --> 28:28.867
Why?

28:28.934 --> 28:31.734
Why can't you just wait
with him here until I get back?

28:31.801 --> 28:34.001
Marilyn, look, he's
frightened of this place.

28:34.068 --> 28:35.034
Understandably so.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.267
I think he needs to be

28:36.334 --> 28:38.534
in familiar surroundings
right now.

28:41.367 --> 28:42.801
All right.

28:42.867 --> 28:44.267
All right, I'll, um,

28:44.334 --> 28:46.300
I'll clear it with
Mr. Buchanan.

28:46.367 --> 28:48.334
Will you explain
things to Josh?

28:48.400 --> 28:49.500
Yeah, sure.

28:53.867 --> 28:55.867
All right, you listen
to your grandfather.

28:55.934 --> 28:57.901
He's in charge.

29:00.767 --> 29:03.200
Phillip, thank you.

29:03.267 --> 29:04.467
Sure.

29:07.934 --> 29:10.200
Sorry to take you away
from Josh.

29:10.267 --> 29:12.167
All you need to do is
identify the house.

29:12.233 --> 29:14.767
I promise you I will not
put you in any danger.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.334
I know.
Mr. Buchanan,

29:16.400 --> 29:18.801
I'd like it if Josh's
grandfather could take him back

29:18.867 --> 29:20.901
to his house.
Of course.

29:22.267 --> 29:23.834
We should go.

29:23.901 --> 29:24.968
Bill, I'll be on comm.

29:26.267 --> 29:29.233
We'll be leaving soon, Josh.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.667
I have to make one phone call.

29:30.734 --> 29:31.968
Just be a minute.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.167
MAN (on phone):
Yes, sir.

29:46.233 --> 29:47.667
Have your men find
and secure a house

29:47.734 --> 29:49.233
in West L.A.
Fine.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.901
I'll text you with the address.

30:04.801 --> 30:07.267
--Morris, we have a lead.

30:07.334 --> 30:08.900
Jack's sister-in-law
thinks she knows

30:08.967 --> 30:10.167
where Gredenko is.

30:10.234 --> 30:11.834
Jack and a Tac team are heading
over there now.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.000
I need your help

30:13.067 --> 30:15.100
running tactical.
Don't be ridiculous.

30:16.167 --> 30:18.167
We're shorthanded.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.933
So get your shirt on,

30:20.000 --> 30:21.701
and let's go.
Running tactical
is what you do best,

30:21.768 --> 30:24.200
why would you
need my help?

30:24.267 --> 30:26.967
Oh... I get it.

30:27.033 --> 30:29.033
You came in here
to give me a pep talk.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.900
Get me back
working behind

30:30.967 --> 30:32.067
that computer
and everything

30:32.134 --> 30:33.701
will be tickety-boo.

30:33.768 --> 30:35.768
Why don't you be a little
less obvious, Chloe.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.167
I'm a coward, not an idiot.

30:40.234 --> 30:42.534
Morris,

30:42.601 --> 30:44.534
I know you've been
through a lot today,

30:44.601 --> 30:46.667
but you're really starting
to piss me off.

30:46.734 --> 30:50.900
Well, let's add that to
my list of failings.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.300
Why did you do that?

30:57.367 --> 30:59.434
I didn't want to.

31:01.467 --> 31:04.234
Look...

31:04.300 --> 31:06.200
if you're gonna try
and save a bloke...

31:06.267 --> 31:10.000
save someone who's worth it.

31:12.734 --> 31:14.334
Stop it, stop it.

31:14.401 --> 31:16.768
Jack and his team are entering
a hostile situation

31:16.834 --> 31:18.134
and they need CTU back up.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.000
Yes, I can do it alone,

31:20.067 --> 31:21.634
but there'd be less
chance of a mistake

31:21.701 --> 31:23.801
if you would help.

31:23.868 --> 31:25.768
So why don't you stop feeling
sorry for yourself

31:25.834 --> 31:26.868
and get back to work!

31:37.601 --> 31:39.734
Milo, we just passed
98th Street.

31:39.801 --> 31:41.967
Roger that, Jack,
we're maintaining our position

31:42.033 --> 31:44.067
six blocks behind you.

31:46.134 --> 31:51.100
I can't imagine what you went
through in China, Jack.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.467
When you were over there,
I thought about you.

32:01.534 --> 32:03.634
I tried not to.

32:03.701 --> 32:06.501
I guess, I've been trying not
to think about you

32:06.567 --> 32:08.067
for over 20 years.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.000
Marilyn, we don't need to talk
about this.

32:10.067 --> 32:11.834
It was your father, wasn't it?

32:11.900 --> 32:14.234
He drove you away.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.868
Tried to pressure you
to work for his company.

32:17.933 --> 32:19.134
Is that why you left,

32:19.200 --> 32:20.734
and enlisted
in the military?

32:20.801 --> 32:22.868
There were a
lot of reasons.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.734
Was I one of them?

32:30.534 --> 32:32.534
No.

32:35.801 --> 32:36.933
(phone rings)

32:41.667 --> 32:42.900
Hello?

32:42.967 --> 32:44.401
Marilyn, it's me.
Don't say anything...

32:44.467 --> 32:45.567
just listen.

32:45.634 --> 32:47.334
I don't want Jack
to know I'm on the line.

32:47.401 --> 32:48.734
Do you understand?

32:49.434 --> 32:50.801
Okay.

32:50.868 --> 32:53.067
You're involved in
something that's much bigger

32:53.134 --> 32:54.868
than you can
possibly imagine.

32:54.967 --> 32:57.868
So here's the deal.

32:57.933 --> 33:01.601
Unless you do exactly
what I say...

33:01.667 --> 33:03.933
I will hurt Josh.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.100
If you don't
believe that,

33:05.167 --> 33:06.868
you might want
to consider this...

33:06.933 --> 33:09.267
Graem's death
was not an accident.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.868
I killed him.

33:11.933 --> 33:13.967
I want you to say,
"Thank you, Susan."

33:16.200 --> 33:18.701
Thank you, Susan.

33:20.134 --> 33:21.601
Now, you're not going
to take Jack to the house

33:21.667 --> 33:22.868
where Graem
met the Russians--

33:22.933 --> 33:24.667
you're going to take him
to a different address--

33:24.734 --> 33:28.234
9407 Hindry Place.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.534
You got it?

33:30.501 --> 33:32.200
Yeah.
Good.

33:32.267 --> 33:33.900
Now, you do this for me,

33:33.967 --> 33:36.534
and I promise you,
you will see Josh again.

33:36.601 --> 33:38.634
If you don't, he dies.

33:40.634 --> 33:42.667
Okay.

33:42.734 --> 33:46.067
9407 Hindry Place.

33:46.134 --> 33:47.933
Do the right thing, Marilyn.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.100
I already lost a son today.

33:51.167 --> 33:52.834
Don't make me lose a grandson.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.300
Good-bye, Susan.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.534
Are you all right?

34:00.601 --> 34:02.200
Fine.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.401
Here you go.
Thank you.

34:07.501 --> 34:09.067
That was my office.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.234
A lot of the roads are still
shut because of the bomb.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.100
Can we get home?

34:13.167 --> 34:16.134
No. And no one knows seems to
know when they'll open up again.

34:16.199 --> 34:17.833
Then what do we do?

34:17.900 --> 34:19.634
We'll go to a hotel.

34:19.701 --> 34:21.933
We can stay there
until they clear up.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.900
Marilyn, is any
of this familiar?

34:45.967 --> 34:47.967
Yes.

34:51.634 --> 34:52.634
Jack?

34:52.701 --> 34:55.333
What?

34:57.567 --> 35:00.834
What is it?

35:00.900 --> 35:02.267
It's nothing.

35:02.334 --> 35:03.768
I thought I saw the house.

35:03.834 --> 35:05.434
But I was wrong.

35:12.467 --> 35:14.467
Oh, that was it.
Hindry Place.

35:15.534 --> 35:17.501
Milo, we got a street.

35:17.567 --> 35:19.868
Hindry Place.
Copy that, Jack.

35:19.933 --> 35:21.234
Relaying it to CTU now.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.667
How long before the new targets
are reprogrammed?

35:31.734 --> 35:33.768
20 minutes.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.601
You still think you can
trust the Arabs?

35:38.667 --> 35:43.334
They serve their purpose.

35:43.401 --> 35:46.967
Our country lost the Cold War
because it was afraid

35:47.033 --> 35:49.267
to use these weapons
against the Americans.

35:54.933 --> 35:57.267
Today we will correct

35:57.334 --> 35:59.601
that mistake.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.768
And the Arabs will take
all the blame.

36:15.234 --> 36:17.234
--All right, we're on it.
Chloe.

36:18.767 --> 36:19.534
Marilyn remembers the street
where she believes

36:19.600 --> 36:20.534
her husband met with Gredenko.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.101
Hindry Place.

36:23.167 --> 36:24.867
That's a mile away from where
they're looking. Is she sure?

36:24.934 --> 36:26.134
That's what she told Jack.

36:26.201 --> 36:28.301
Pull up all access roads
in and out of the area.

36:28.367 --> 36:30.568
I'm in the middle of
reconfiguring the uplink.

36:36.501 --> 36:37.733
I'll put Morris on it.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.267
Your call.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.633
I know you're lying to me.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.234
Just like my mom.

37:05.301 --> 37:06.633
You're all treating me

37:06.700 --> 37:09.034
like I'm just some
stupid little kid.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.301
What are you talking about?

37:10.367 --> 37:12.201
I want to know why my dad died.

37:12.267 --> 37:14.067
What's your mother told you?
It was a heart attack.

37:14.134 --> 37:16.000
I know, but...

37:16.067 --> 37:17.434
I know he was
doing something

37:17.501 --> 37:19.267
illegal or whatever.

37:19.334 --> 37:22.101
But nobody's telling me
what it was, and I just

37:22.167 --> 37:24.733
want to know.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.468
Did it have to do with the nuke?

37:27.534 --> 37:29.700
Look, Josh...

37:29.767 --> 37:31.600
you're gonna hear a lot
of things about your father,

37:31.667 --> 37:33.201
what he may or
may not have done.

37:33.267 --> 37:36.367
I'm not gonna pretend
it's going to be
easy for you.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.534
You know,
no matter what...

37:40.600 --> 37:42.733
I'm gonna be
there for you.

37:58.633 --> 38:01.401
That's it. The pale blue
house on the right.

38:01.468 --> 38:02.501
Are you sure?

38:02.568 --> 38:03.667
Yeah.

38:03.733 --> 38:07.434
We've got an address.
9407 Hindry Place.

38:07.501 --> 38:09.468
Initiate tactical
response with CTU.

38:09.534 --> 38:10.967
Have them bring up the
schematics of the house.

38:11.034 --> 38:12.834
Meet me in the alley
behind the target.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.568
All right, I'm on it.

38:16.034 --> 38:17.367
Hold on.

38:44.434 --> 38:45.934
We're going after
the blue house.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.301
Advise your men,
non-lethal force.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.434
We need Gredenko alive.

38:49.501 --> 38:50.834
Jack...

38:50.900 --> 38:52.534
Marilyn, I want you to stay
in the tactical van.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.034
You'll be safe there.
But, I have...

38:54.101 --> 38:56.267
Jack, I've got the schematics.
There are two entrances.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.434
One in the front,

38:57.501 --> 38:58.468
one on the west
side of the house.

38:58.534 --> 39:00.301
Okay, I'll contact
CTU as soon as

39:00.367 --> 39:01.401
we've got Gredenko
in custody.

39:01.468 --> 39:02.900
Milo, I want you
to stay with Marilyn.

39:02.967 --> 39:03.900
Are your men ready?

39:03.967 --> 39:05.101
We're set.
Let's go.

39:33.468 --> 39:35.167
All teams go. Go!

39:36.967 --> 39:38.201
Go! Go!

39:45.633 --> 39:47.434
Bomb! Everyone out!

39:50.234 --> 39:51.367
(loud explosion)

39:52.301 --> 39:54.000
Oh!

39:55.267 --> 39:56.867
Jack!

39:56.934 --> 39:58.600
We've gotta go!
No! No!

39:58.667 --> 40:01.167
Get in the van!
Get in the van
and close the door!

40:06.600 --> 40:08.733
Jack? Jack, can you hear me?

40:43.434 --> 40:45.101
(automatic gunfire)

40:47.867 --> 40:50.000
(tires screeching)

40:53.434 --> 40:56.134
Oh, they're coming!
Get out! Come on! Move! Move!

40:57.600 --> 40:59.201
(screams)

41:01.767 --> 41:03.067
Don't hit the woman!
We need her alive!

41:06.733 --> 41:08.401
(gunshots blasting)

41:12.134 --> 41:13.234
Move!

41:13.301 --> 41:14.301
Move! Come on, come on! Move!

41:15.134 --> 41:16.301
Go, go, go!

41:46.034 --> 41:48.201
(grunting):
All agents report in.

41:48.267 --> 41:51.101
All agents report in now.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.401
Calling in for EMT.

41:58.468 --> 42:00.334
