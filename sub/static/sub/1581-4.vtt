And man the cannon.

15:19.188 --> 15:22.156
You see that tie again,
take your shot.

15:24.326 --> 15:28.329
Don't think he's taking
commander meiloorun's
orders anymore.

15:35.971 --> 15:38.172
Mr. Sumar!
Ezra?

15:38.174 --> 15:40.040
Hold on.
I'll have you out soon.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.044
[ grunts ]

15:48.116 --> 15:50.985
You'll never reach it.
It's too dangerous.

15:56.391 --> 15:59.226
Okay, you can do this.

16:04.966 --> 16:06.867
[ beeps ]

16:08.236 --> 16:10.170
I knew I'd get
the hang of that.

16:10.172 --> 16:13.474
Sir, someone's
unlocked the prisoners
on transport 3.

16:13.476 --> 16:15.442
I want troopers up top, now!

16:16.778 --> 16:19.046
You have to jump.
Jump and scatter.

16:19.048 --> 16:21.315
We're moving too fast!

16:21.317 --> 16:23.851
So you'd rather
stay prisoners?

16:38.466 --> 16:40.167
Whoa.

16:40.169 --> 16:43.203
Sir, the prisoners
are escaping.
Open fire.

16:52.514 --> 16:55.282
That gun turret's
gonna be a problem.

16:55.284 --> 16:58.519
- This bird has no shields.
- Working on it.

17:09.297 --> 17:11.298
Well, hello, stranger.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.507
Maintain fire.
His shots won't penetrate
your armor.

17:20.509 --> 17:22.343
What the--

17:24.346 --> 17:26.446
Aaah!

17:26.449 --> 17:28.281
Not bad, kid.

17:38.126 --> 17:39.626
Gotcha!

17:41.096 --> 17:44.131
Wait!
You did all this...
For fruit?

17:45.166 --> 17:48.302
No!
Okay, maybe a little.

17:55.110 --> 17:57.111
There's gotta be
something useful in here.

17:57.113 --> 17:59.546
A wrench? A wrench!

18:12.594 --> 18:15.229
All for fruit!

18:17.399 --> 18:19.032
[ gasps ]

18:19.034 --> 18:20.567
[ blasters cocking ]

18:28.109 --> 18:30.110
Not bad, ace.

18:43.091 --> 18:44.458
[ zeb ]
gotcha!

18:46.194 --> 18:48.128
Uh, how are you
flying this thing?

18:48.130 --> 18:49.263
[ grunting ]

19:03.111 --> 19:05.579
Thanks for the save.
Guess I owe <i> you</i> now.

19:05.581 --> 19:08.182
Let's just say
we're eternally even.

19:08.184 --> 19:10.150
Oh. You collect these, right?

19:10.152 --> 19:11.385
Already have that one.

19:14.189 --> 19:16.490
But this
is a nice one.

19:16.492 --> 19:19.193
Besides, maybe
I can get sabine
to paint it for me.

19:19.195 --> 19:20.961
So... Thanks.

19:22.363 --> 19:24.465
So, what do we do
about the tie?

19:27.669 --> 19:30.103
[ chuckling ]

19:30.105 --> 19:32.406
[ grunts ]

19:39.214 --> 19:41.415
Ah, they should have
been here by now.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.218
Over there!

19:54.996 --> 19:58.098
One fresh meiloorun,
as ordered.

19:58.100 --> 19:59.466
Thank you, kind sir.

19:59.468 --> 20:01.134
Team effort.

20:01.136 --> 20:03.604
Forget about the fruit.
Where's the tie fighter?

20:04.772 --> 20:07.207
[ sighs ]
I crashed it.

20:07.209 --> 20:11.378
On purpose.
Uh, we didn't want it to fall
back into the empire's hands.

20:14.482 --> 20:17.184
That's what
I like to hear.

20:18.052 --> 20:22.022
[ sighs, chuckling ]

20:22.024 --> 20:23.090
[ laughs ]

20:26.160 --> 20:28.295
[ laughing continues ]

20:28.297 --> 20:30.030
[ grunts, laughing ]

20:30.032 --> 20:31.398
Finished.

20:33.167 --> 20:35.168
Uh, finished
with what, sabine?

20:35.170 --> 20:38.138
Thought it was a moment
that needed to be immortalized.

20:39.340 --> 20:40.807
[ grumbling ]

20:40.809 --> 20:43.210
And you did say
you wanted to be
my inspiration.

20:43.212 --> 20:46.179
Yeah, but that makes me
look like a fool.

20:46.181 --> 20:48.181
[ zeb ] makes me look
like a bigger fool.

20:48.183 --> 20:50.117
I paint what I see.

20:50.119 --> 20:52.419
[ laughs,
blows raspberry ]

20:52.421 --> 20:55.222
Chopper!
This was all
your fault!

20:55.224 --> 20:57.291
[ chittering ]
come back,
you metal menace!

20:57.293 --> 21:00.861
I'm tearing
that rust bucket apart!
[ growls ]

21:04.132 --> 21:06.300
[ crashing ]
oh.

21:06.302 --> 21:08.201
It's his fault!
It's his fault!

21:08.203 --> 21:10.571
At least they got rid
of the tie.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.639
[ inhales, exhales ]

21:12.641 --> 21:14.174
Uh--

21:14.176 --> 21:16.376
[ sighs ]
