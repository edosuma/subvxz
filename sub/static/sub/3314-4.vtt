WEBVTT

00:09.890 --> 00:12.182
YOU KNOW, I CANNOT BELIEVE MARCO AND
LENNOX HAVE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND.

00:12.183 --> 00:13.763
MY OWN NEPHEW, HE LIED TO ME.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.895
MY NIECE LIED TO ME, TOO. HOW
COME I'M NOT FREAKING OUT?

00:15.896 --> 00:17.897
I DON'T KNOW. PAINKILLERS?

00:17.898 --> 00:20.940
PLEASE. I BUILT UP A TOLERANCE
TO THOSE YEARS AGO.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.143
HOURS AGO.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.984
IT'S DIFFERENT, OKAY?

00:24.985 --> 00:26.196
MARCO MADE LENNOX LIE TO YOU.

00:26.197 --> 00:28.858
MADE HER? WHAT, DOES HE GOT
SOME KIND OF HOLD ON HER?

00:28.859 --> 00:30.910
YES! HONEY, I KEEP
TELLING YOU, ALRIGHT?

00:30.911 --> 00:33.864
YOU ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE POWER
OF A MALE WITH LONGO BLOOD.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.867
WE CAN GET WOMEN TO DO ANYTHING.

00:37.828 --> 00:39.120
ANYTHING!

00:40.211 --> 00:41.872
THE POWERS ARE LIMITLESS.

00:43.374 --> 00:45.505
CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR HERE, PLEASE?
YUP.

00:45.506 --> 00:47.927
I... I JUST THINK WE SHOULD
ENJOY THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT SKY

00:47.928 --> 00:50.170
UNTIL YOUR URGE
TO MURDER PASSES.

00:50.171 --> 00:52.802
BABE, I'M TELLING YOU,
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE,

00:52.803 --> 00:56.015
I'M GONNA BE UNDER CONTROL. I'M
NOT EVEN GONNA RAISE MY VOICE.

00:56.016 --> 00:57.767
TRUST ME.

00:57.768 --> 00:59.179
OKAY.

00:59.180 --> 01:00.520
I DIDN'T BRING MY KEYS.

01:00.521 --> 01:01.852
GRAB MINE, THEY'RE IN MY POCKET.

01:03.854 --> 01:05.985
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
YOUR KEYS ARE IN HERE.

01:05.986 --> 01:07.187
I'M SORRY, I MEANT
THE OTHER POCKET.

01:07.188 --> 01:09.780
SO YOU WERE JUST GONNA LET ME
FEEL AROUND IN THERE ALL DAY?

01:11.822 --> 01:13.574
I WAS.

01:15.866 --> 01:17.617
- GET IN THERE.
- EH...

01:17.618 --> 01:18.998
- COOL AND CALM?
- YO...

01:18.999 --> 01:20.621
(scoffs) COOL AND CALMED.

01:21.962 --> 01:24.004
(sinister music plays on TV)

01:43.894 --> 01:45.896
- HELLO, LOVEBIRDS.
- (both scream)

01:47.398 --> 01:49.399
UM... AUNT MEL, JOE, UH...

01:49.400 --> 01:50.990
WHAT... WHAT ARE YOU
GUYS DOING HOME?

01:50.991 --> 01:52.492
YOU SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH.

01:52.493 --> 01:54.195
GREAT! NOW I'M GONNA
FINISH THE OTHER HALF.

01:55.536 --> 01:56.827
(clears throat)

01:57.788 --> 01:58.868
CALMLY.

WHAT, DID YOU THINK I
WASN'T GONNA FIND OUT?

02:24.855 --> 02:26.896
I GOT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU, MARCO.
JUST ONE.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.818
DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?
OR ARE YOU STUPID?

02:28.819 --> 02:30.400
I'M NOT STUPID.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.982
THAT'S TWO QUESTIONS.

02:34.074 --> 02:35.735
THAT'S TWO... TWO QUES...
(laughs nervously)

02:35.736 --> 02:38.238
OKAY. COME ON, MARCO. WE DON'T
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS.

02:38.239 --> 02:39.619
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.701
ACTUALLY, THEY DON'T.
THEY'RE ADULTS.

02:41.702 --> 02:43.283
HEY!

02:43.284 --> 02:44.334
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ADULTS,

02:44.335 --> 02:45.875
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S RIGHT
TO LIE TO MY FACE.

02:45.876 --> 02:47.417
YOU WANNA PUNCH ME?

02:47.418 --> 02:48.419
GO AHEAD.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.963
OKAY. NO. HITTING HIM ISN'T GONNA
CHANGE THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT HIM.

02:53.964 --> 02:55.295
I KNOW THAT!

02:55.296 --> 02:56.387
BUT I WOULD FEEL BETTER.

02:57.388 --> 02:59.799
JOE, HITTING DOESN'T
SOLVE ANYTHING, RIGHT?

02:59.800 --> 03:00.890
ALL RIGHT, FINE!

03:00.891 --> 03:02.141
FINE, NO ONE'S GONNA HIT ANYONE.

03:02.142 --> 03:04.264
MARCO KNOWS WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS WRONG.
OTHERWISE,

03:04.265 --> 03:06.015
WHY WOULD HE BE
KEEPING IT A SECRET?

03:06.016 --> 03:08.229
I'M THE ONE WHO WANTED
TO KEEP IT A SECRET.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.811
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT US, BUT...

03:12.072 --> 03:13.573
NOW I AM.

03:13.574 --> 03:15.815
- AWW!
- DON'T "AWW"!

03:15.816 --> 03:18.197
THIS IS... THIS IS NOT AN "AWW"!

03:18.198 --> 03:20.410
IT'S NOT THE WORST
THING IN THE WORLD.

03:20.411 --> 03:21.781
I DON'T KNOW.

03:21.782 --> 03:22.913
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

03:23.784 --> 03:24.874
UNCLE JOE...

03:24.875 --> 03:26.456
I KNOW YOU THINK I'M
JUST A MOOK FROM JERSEY

03:26.457 --> 03:27.787
AND SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE,

03:27.788 --> 03:30.090
BUT THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN
DO TO HOLD BACK TRUE LIKE.

03:31.882 --> 03:33.463
SEE HOW I DIDN'T SAY "LOVE"?

03:33.464 --> 03:35.716
I KNOW YOU WANNA TAKE THIS
THING SLOW AND I RESPECT THAT.

03:37.338 --> 03:38.798
I DON'T GET IT.

03:38.799 --> 03:40.841
WHAT COULD YOU TWO
POSSIBLY HAVE IN COMMON?

03:42.513 --> 03:44.264
(both laugh)

03:44.265 --> 03:46.015
OH JEEZ!

03:46.016 --> 03:48.348
UM, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GIVE ME AND JOE A MINUTE?

03:48.349 --> 03:50.900
OK. I'M JUST RELIEVED
THIS IS OUT IN THE OPEN.

03:50.901 --> 03:53.022
COME ON, MARCO. WE'LL
BE UP IN MY ROOM.

03:53.023 --> 03:54.814
KEEP YOUR DOOR OPEN.

03:54.815 --> 03:56.195
I MEAN, CLOSE IT.

03:56.196 --> 03:57.737
I MEAN...

03:57.738 --> 03:58.949
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT!

04:00.741 --> 04:02.533
JOE, I THINK YOU HANDLED THAT...

04:03.704 --> 04:04.825
AS WELL AS YOU COULD.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.997
YEAH, IT'S A BIG VICTORY.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.079
LENNOX IS UPSTAIRS IN HER BEDROOM
RIGHT NOW WITH A PLAYER.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.923
LENNOX IS A GROWN WOMAN. SHE'S
GONNA DO WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.

04:13.924 --> 04:15.635
WOW.

04:15.636 --> 04:16.967
I'M POWERLESS.

04:18.589 --> 04:19.840
I AM COMPLETELY POWERLESS.

04:20.931 --> 04:23.304
THESE... GUNS, THEY...

04:24.885 --> 04:26.056
THEY HAVE NO FIRING PIN.

04:27.888 --> 04:29.769
OH! YOU'RE BACK!

04:29.770 --> 04:32.352
LISTEN, THIS BOY ASKED ME OUT
ON A DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:32.353 --> 04:33.603
I WON'T BE TOO LATE.

04:33.604 --> 04:36.486
YOU SEE THAT? FIRST WEEK IN A NEW SCHOOL
AND DANI'S ALREADY MAKING FRIENDS.

04:36.487 --> 04:39.069
- ISN'T THAT GREAT? -IT'S AWESOME.
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

04:40.361 --> 04:41.901
BUT I ALREADY SAID YES.

04:41.902 --> 04:43.823
OH! OH, YOU ALREADY SAID YES?

04:43.824 --> 04:45.705
OH, WELL. YOU KNOW,
IT THAT CASE...

04:45.706 --> 04:47.617
YOU'RE NOT GOING.

04:47.618 --> 04:49.789
- WHY?
- WHY? YOU WANT A REASON?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.961
ALL RIGHT. LOOK, I ACTUALLY
HAVE A VERY GOOD ONE.

04:51.962 --> 04:54.374
NOW, LOOK, IT'S... IT'S A
LITTLE COMPLICATED, BUT, UH...

04:54.375 --> 04:56.045
HERE IT IS...

04:56.046 --> 04:58.048
'CAUSE I SAID SO.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.972
OH, YOU'RE SUCH A DICTATOR!

05:03.424 --> 05:06.185
WOW! FIRST LENNOX IS
MAD AT YOU, NOW DANI.

05:06.186 --> 05:07.848
I'M SORRY, JOE.

05:09.019 --> 05:10.890
YOU KIDDING?

05:10.891 --> 05:12.272
THAT FELT GREAT!

05:14.395 --> 05:16.026
FIRING PIN IS COMING BACK.

05:19.530 --> 05:20.900
HEY, LOOK AT THIS!

05:20.901 --> 05:22.492
THE MONSTER TRUCK
RALLY IS IN TOWN.

05:22.493 --> 05:25.324
UGH... CAN YOU IMAGINE PEOPLE
ACTUALLY GO TO THAT CRAP?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.618
DID I MENTION I WELDED THE
CAGE TO THE CRUSHMOBILE

05:28.619 --> 05:31.290
AT THE NORTHEAST
MONSTER TRUCK-O-RAMA?

05:31.291 --> 05:33.544
AND WE WON "MOST BODACIOUS."

05:34.955 --> 05:36.165
THAT'S...

05:36.166 --> 05:37.378
IMPRESSIVE.

05:38.419 --> 05:41.422
DON'T WORRY, I'M SURE THERE'S TONS OF
THINGS WE CAN FIND TO DO TOGETHER.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.465
Both: HMM...

05:45.726 --> 05:48.638
HEY, AMELIA JUST ASKED IF I COULD
GO TO THE MOVIES WITH HER TONIGHT.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.770
- CAN YOU TAKE ME?
- OH, HAPPY TO.

05:50.771 --> 05:52.231
YEAH, NOW THAT I
GOT MY CAST OFF,

05:52.232 --> 05:53.933
THAT'S THE KIND OF
WONDERFUL THING I CAN DO.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.736
I CAN ALSO DO THIS.

06:00.691 --> 06:04.033
WOW! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST COOL AUNT
MEL, YOU'RE COOL STEPMOM MEL.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.445
I AM!

06:05.446 --> 06:07.197
I NEED TO UPDATE MY TWITTER BIO.

06:08.909 --> 06:10.410
YOU ARE MUCH COOLER THAN JOE.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.041
I KNOW, BUT DON'T TELL HIM.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.834
(mimics Jack Nicholson) HE
CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

06:15.045 --> 06:16.876
THAT'S A REFERENCE.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.459
NEVER MIND.

06:20.551 --> 06:23.172
HEY, I BET THERE'S TONS OF
MOVIES THAT WE COULD SEE.

06:23.173 --> 06:24.674
OH YEAH, OF COURSE THERE ARE.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.767
OOH, I REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS FRENCH
FILM, LA TRISTESSE DE MA MèRE.

06:27.768 --> 06:30.059
IT MEANS "THE SADNESS
OF MY MOTHER."

06:30.060 --> 06:32.272
IF HIS MOTHER'S A ROBOT, I'M IN.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.064
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I
HEAR IS ALSO COOL?

06:35.065 --> 06:36.476
ZEKE, THE TALKING DONKEY.

06:36.477 --> 06:37.817
CHECK OUT THE AD.

06:37.818 --> 06:39.358
"ZEKE...

06:39.359 --> 06:41.442
"THE DIRTIEST ASS IN CLEVELAND."

06:42.943 --> 06:44.233
GET IT?

06:44.234 --> 06:45.946
I WISH I DIDN'T.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.327
OH, OKAY.

06:48.328 --> 06:49.870
MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST GIVE UP, HUH?

06:50.951 --> 06:52.792
WHAT? NO, NO, HOLD ON.
HOW ABOUT...

06:52.793 --> 06:55.414
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?
HANG THE IRON LANTERN?

06:55.415 --> 06:58.167
IT'S A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A LOCAL
SCULPTOR, THORNDYKE WELLES.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.039
HE MAKES ART, WHICH I LIKE,

07:00.040 --> 07:02.962
AND HIS SCULPTURES ARE MADE OF METAL,
WHICH YOU, AS A WELDER, WOULD ENJOY.

07:02.963 --> 07:04.844
THAT SOUNDS GOOD, DOESN'T IT?

07:04.845 --> 07:05.966
YEAH.

07:07.007 --> 07:08.849
- ARE YOU LYING?
- YEAH.

07:10.811 --> 07:13.012
BUT SERIOUSLY, IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED,

07:13.013 --> 07:14.054
I'M INTERESTED.

07:17.858 --> 07:20.860
BUT IF THAT ART MOVIE IS SOLD
OUT, THE DONKEY MOVIE, 3-D,

07:20.861 --> 07:23.524
SO WHEN ZEKE BURPS,
YOUR HAIR BLOWS BACK.

07:29.069 --> 07:31.331
(clapping)

07:35.075 --> 07:37.456
THORNDYKE WELLES
IS SUCH A GENIUS.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.580
I MEAN, TO SPEND THREE YEARS
WORKING ON THAT ONE SCULPTURE.

07:40.581 --> 07:42.632
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS
DOING ALL THAT TIME.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.884
ME AND MY BOYS COULD HAVE THAT
THING KNOCKED OUT IN A WEEKEND.

07:44.885 --> 07:47.547
NO! HE WAS CREATING
SOMETHING OF...

07:47.548 --> 07:49.388
INCREDIBLE SYMBOLIC COMPLEXITY.

07:49.389 --> 07:52.852
WHATEVER! THE WELDS SUCKED.

07:52.853 --> 07:56.396
DRIPPY. UNEVEN. HE IS NOT GETTING IN
THE UNION WITH SLOPPY WORK LIKE THAT.

07:57.938 --> 08:00.600
- HEY, LENNOX.
- ZANDER.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.942
YOU KNOW MARCO.

08:02.943 --> 08:04.905
YEAH, WE'VE MET.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.407
SO, UH...

08:08.408 --> 08:09.869
- THAT'S NEW.
- OH YEAH.

08:09.870 --> 08:11.781
WELL, AFTER YOU BROKE UP
WITH ME, MY ROOMMATES

08:11.782 --> 08:13.873
THOUGHT IT WISE TO HIDE ALL
THE RAZOR BLADES, SO...

08:13.874 --> 08:15.165
VOILA!

08:16.877 --> 08:19.999
SO, THE MOVIE. WAS THAT
INCREDIBLE OR WHAT?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.211
YEAH. THORNDYKE
WELLES IS A GENIUS.

08:22.212 --> 08:24.584
OH, HE'S GONNA BE SIGNING COPIES
OF HIS BOOK IN THE LOBBY.

08:24.585 --> 08:27.927
I KNOW! I'M ACTUALLY WORKING UP THE
COURAGE TO RE-INTRODUCE MYSELF TO HIM.

08:27.928 --> 08:31.010
I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM LAST WEEK
TO BE AN INTERN AT HIS ART STUDIO.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.554
EXCUSE ME, I'M GONNA GO MAKE
SOME ART IN THE MEN'S ROOM.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.847
IF I RUN INTO THORNDYKE, I'LL TELL
HIM WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS WELDS.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.852
IT'S A GOOD PLAN. I'M
SURE HE'LL LOVE THAT.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.314
SO... (chuckles)

08:45.315 --> 08:46.856
YOU TWO ARE, UH...

08:46.857 --> 08:48.527
OFFICIALLY GOING OUT, HUH?

08:48.528 --> 08:49.949
- WE ARE.
- GOOD.

08:49.950 --> 08:52.031
GOOD. QUESTION...

08:52.032 --> 08:53.953
QUESTION, UH...

08:53.954 --> 08:55.204
WHEN YOU TAKE HIM TO
A MOVIE LIKE THIS,

08:55.205 --> 08:57.037
DO YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT TO
HIM IN LITTLE TINY WORDS?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.159
IT'S NOT NICE TO TALK
BEHIND SOMEONE'S BACK.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.922
NO, I KNOW, BUT IF I
SAID IT TO HIS FACE,

09:02.923 --> 09:04.665
HE'D PUNCH ME.

09:10.090 --> 09:11.801
HEY.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.843
DANI! GREAT!

09:13.844 --> 09:15.845
I THOUGHT YOUR DAD WOULDN'T
LET YOU COME OUT ON A DATE.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.556
MY DAD HAS NO IDEA.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.679
LUCKILY, MY STEPMOM'S
EASY TO SCAM.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.022
JOAQUIN AND DASH ARE GETTING US SOME
POPCORN. THEY'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

09:23.023 --> 09:26.145
- HIYA!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:26.146 --> 09:27.817
YOU WERE JUST SUPPOSED
TO DROP ME OFF.

09:27.818 --> 09:29.238
OH. WELL, I SAW THE POSTER.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.861
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A ZEKE MOVIE.
I LOVE THAT TALKING DONKEY.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.113
YOU KNOW, HE REALLY
SPEAKS HIS MIND.

09:34.114 --> 09:37.787
ANYWAY, IF IT'S AWKWARD FOR YOUR GIRLFRIENDS
TO SEE ME, I CAN SIT A FEW ROWS BACK.

09:40.961 --> 09:42.331
THAT WAS WEIRD.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.505
A TOTALLY RANDOM BOY JUST HANDED ME
POPCORN FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.878
- IS THIS A DATE?
- NO!

09:48.879 --> 09:50.129
IT'S A DOUBLE DATE.

09:50.130 --> 09:51.211
THANKS!

09:52.883 --> 09:54.173
DON'T TELL JOE.

09:54.174 --> 09:56.806
(deep voice) HE CAN'T
HANDLE THE TRUTH.

09:56.807 --> 09:58.428
DID I SAY IT RIGHT?

10:02.222 --> 10:04.483
DANI, YOUR DAD TOLD
YOU NO DATING!

10:04.484 --> 10:06.896
YEAH, BUT CLEARLY
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.567
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
HERE WITH THESE BOYS.

10:08.568 --> 10:10.690
THAT WOULD BE LIKE LYING TO JOE.

10:10.691 --> 10:13.362
I'VE DONE IT. IT'S
NOT THAT HARD.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.695
JOE AND I ARE A TEAM. I
CAN'T GO BEHIND HIS BACK.

10:15.696 --> 10:17.196
BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?

10:17.197 --> 10:19.659
IT'LL BE TOTALLY EMBARRASSING
IF I JUST LEAVE.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.371
COME ON, YOU WERE 13 ONCE.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.043
NOT THAT LONG AGO.

10:24.044 --> 10:26.126
UH-HUH, YEAH. LIKE I'M
GONNA FALL FOR THAT.

10:27.207 --> 10:29.009
HOW LONG AGO DO YOU THINK?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.961
IF MY STEPMOM DRAGS
ME OUT OF HERE,

10:31.962 --> 10:35.845
THE HUMILIATING PHOTOS WILL BE ALL OVER
THE INTERNET BEFORE I LEAVE THE LOBBY.

10:35.846 --> 10:38.387
MY LIFE AT MY NEW SCHOOL
WILL BE TOTALLY RUINED.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.970
OKAY, BUT JOE NEVER FINDS OUT.

10:40.971 --> 10:42.892
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.104
ALL RIGHT, I'LL WAIT
FOR YOU IN THE LOBBY.

10:45.105 --> 10:47.857
BUT WHEN THIS MOVIE GETS OUT,
YOU ARE GETTING A HICKEY CHECK.

10:47.858 --> 10:49.939
WHAT'S A HICKEY?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.361
HA-HA. NICE TRY.

10:58.368 --> 11:00.659
- MORNING.
- HEY!

11:00.660 --> 11:02.702
DANI MUST BE PRETTY MAD AT ME.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.333
KIDS, HUH?

11:04.334 --> 11:06.786
YEAH, WELL, SHE DIDN'T
EVEN SAY GOOD NIGHT TO ME

11:06.787 --> 11:08.838
WHEN YOU GUYS GOT HOME FROM
THE MOVIES LAST NIGHT.

11:08.839 --> 11:11.671
I'LL TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, HER DAD SAYS SHE
CAN'T DATE, ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M A MONSTER.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.503

FOR BEING A TOUGH PARENT.

11:14.504 --> 11:15.966
YEP, YEP, YEP.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.798
I GOTTA TELL YOU, HONEY, IT
REALLY MEANS THE WORLD TO ME

11:18.799 --> 11:20.599
THAT YOU HAVE MY
BACK ON THIS ONE,

11:20.600 --> 11:22.972
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW YOU AND
I ARE TRULY TEAMMATES.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.644
YEP, YEP, YEP.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.357
AND I JUST WANNA APOLOGIZE IN
ADVANCE BECAUSE IN ABOUT A MINUTE

11:28.358 --> 11:31.110
DANI'S GOING TO COME DOWNSTAIRS,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE THROWING

11:31.111 --> 11:33.652
A WHOLE BUNCH OF TEENAGE
ATTITUDE OUR WAY.

11:33.653 --> 11:36.525
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE!

11:36.526 --> 11:38.988
DID YOU SEE THE SKY OUTSIDE?

11:38.989 --> 11:40.659
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.031
IT'S LIKE A SCREEN SAVER!

11:42.032 --> 11:44.704
HASHTAG NO FILTER!

11:46.206 --> 11:47.957
HEY, KIDDO.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.790
HOW DID YOU AND THE GIRLS ENJOY
THE TALKING DONKEY MOVIE?

11:50.791 --> 11:52.832
SO STUPID.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.174
I LOVED IT.

11:58.178 --> 11:59.719
WOW.

12:01.431 --> 12:02.932
YOU SEE WHAT I DID?

12:02.933 --> 12:04.054
WHAT?

12:05.896 --> 12:07.938
I PARENTED THE CRAP OUT OF HER!

12:09.229 --> 12:11.440
YOU KNOW, MEL, CONFIRMS
WHAT I ALWAYS THOUGHT:

12:11.441 --> 12:14.694
EVEN WITH KIDS TODAY, A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
DOSE OF VITAMIN N STILL WORKS.

12:15.695 --> 12:17.486
- VITAMIN N?
- YEAH, THE WORD "NO".

12:17.487 --> 12:19.528
ADMINISTER AS NEEDED.

12:19.529 --> 12:21.821
UP HIGH, TEAMMATE.

12:21.822 --> 12:23.363
YEP, YEP, YEP.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.367
- HEY.
- HEY!

12:28.368 --> 12:32.171
SO, HERE ARE THIS WEEK'S
DRAWINGS FOR "CASSANDRA."

12:32.172 --> 12:33.833
GREAT, THANKS.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.965
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD THAT
EVEN THOUGH WE BROKE UP,

12:35.966 --> 12:38.087
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER
ON OUR WEB SERIES.

12:38.088 --> 12:40.800
YEAH! OH, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE I MIGHT
BE WORKING WITH PRETTY SOON?

12:40.801 --> 12:42.641
I'LL TELL YOU HIS INITIALS:

12:42.642 --> 12:44.434
IT'S RENOWNED AMERICAN
SCULPTOR, THORNDYKE WELLES!

12:45.515 --> 12:46.806
WAIT, YOU GOT THE INTERNSHIP?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.057
WELL, NOT QUITE.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.688
IT'S DOWN TO ME AND
ONE OTHER GUY.

12:49.689 --> 12:52.892
THERE'S NO WAY THAT OTHER DWERP
IS ONE-TENTH AS TALENTED AS YOU.

12:52.893 --> 12:55.154
YOU'RE TOTALLY GETTING
THIS INTERNSHIP.

12:55.155 --> 12:58.859
WELL, YOU CAN'T BE TOO SURE, ESPECIALLY
SINCE THE OTHER DWERP IS ME.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.071
- WHAT? -EXCUSE ME, WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

13:02.072 --> 13:06.245
YEAH! AFTER THE SCREENING, I WOUND UP
STANDING BESIDE THORNDYKE AT THE URINALS.

13:06.246 --> 13:08.538
I TOLD HIM WHAT I THOUGHT
OF HIS LAME PIPE.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.044
THEN I CLARIFIED AND EXPLAINED I
WAS REFERRING TO HIS SHODDY WELDS.

13:16.586 --> 13:19.218
OKAY, SO... THE
OTHER GUY IS YOU.

ZANDER, HE'S NOT DOING
ANYTHING TO YOU.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.900
ARE YOU BLIND, LENNOX? YOUR BOYFRIEND
IS TOTALLY SCREWING BOTH OF US!

13:42.903 --> 13:44.574
IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS.

NEED ANY MORE HELP,

HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT ONE.

AND TOLD YOU WHAT I DID FOR DANI.

19:45.805 --> 19:47.856
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.

19:47.857 --> 19:50.609
IN OTHER WORDS...

19:50.610 --> 19:52.232
YOU WERE, UM...

19:53.653 --> 19:55.524
REALLY? YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME SAY IT?

19:55.525 --> 19:58.237
I'M JUST SAYING. YOU KNOW, YOU WENT THROUGH
ALL THIS TROUBLE FOR A ROMANTIC EVENING.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.819
THIS COULD REALLY GET
THE NIGHT GOING.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.372
I WAS...

20:03.623 --> 20:06.535
- WRONG.
- OH GOD, THAT DOES IT TO ME.

20:06.536 --> 20:08.377
- SO WRONG.
- MM-HMM.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.879
MISTAKEN. INCORRECT.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.712
I AM NOT WITHHOLDING
ANYTHING FROM YOU TONIGHT.

20:16.836 --> 20:19.838
SO, I START TOMORROW AS THORNDYKE'S
NEW INTERN, YOU KNOW...

20:19.839 --> 20:21.930
ANSWERING PHONE CALLS,
RUNNING ERRANDS...

20:21.931 --> 20:23.393
PLUNGING THE OCCASIONAL TOILET.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.845
DOESN'T SOUND VERY GLAMOROUS,
BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED.

20:26.846 --> 20:30.018
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'LL BE WORKING SIDE BY
SIDE WITH HIM IN HIS STUDIO IN NO TIME.

20:30.019 --> 20:32.351
OH NO. (laughs) NO.

20:32.352 --> 20:35.024
NO. HE MADE IT VERY CLEAR: NOBODY
TOUCHES THE ART BUT MR. WELLES.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.527
- HEY GUYS.
- (both) OH HEY!

20:38.528 --> 20:40.198
HEY, YOU KNOW, SORRY
ABOUT THAT JOB.

20:40.199 --> 20:42.121
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, RIGHT?

20:43.202 --> 20:44.863
YEAH, MAYBE IT JUST
WASN'T THE JOB FOR YOU,

20:44.864 --> 20:47.866
BUT I KNOW THERE WILL BE OTHER
OPPORTUNITIES THAT FIT YOU PERFECTLY.

20:47.867 --> 20:52.001
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THORNDYKE SAID WHEN HE
TOLD ME I WASN'T GONNA GET THAT GOPHER JOB.

20:53.423 --> 20:55.714
BUT THEN A FUNNY THING HAPPENED.

20:55.715 --> 20:57.966
HE JUST CALLED AND ASKED IF I
WANNA HELP OUT IN THE STUDIO

20:57.967 --> 21:00.088
POURING METAL AND
DOING THE WELDING.

21:00.089 --> 21:02.512
I'M GONNA BE HIS NEW APPRENTICE!

21:05.645 --> 21:07.015
SO YOU'RE GONNA TOUCH THE ART?

21:07.016 --> 21:08.146
YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO THAT?

21:08.147 --> 21:10.889
HIS EXACT WORDS WERE,

21:10.890 --> 21:11.890
"MARCO, I WANT YOU

21:11.891 --> 21:14.273
"BY MY SIDE AS I CREATE."

21:20.279 --> 21:21.360
WELL, DIDN'T THIS JUST

21:21.361 --> 21:23.162
WORK OUT GREAT FOR EVERYBODY?
