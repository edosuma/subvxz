WEBVTT

00:03.603 --> 00:05.170
(camera clicking)

00:05.172 --> 00:08.540
Mcgee:
This is marine sergeant
michael dawson.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.010
28 years old.
Poor guy was on leave

00:11.012 --> 00:12.211
Just doing some shopping.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.113
Robbery gone bad, duck.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.714
Yes, amidst a flock

00:15.716 --> 00:18.183
Of fine wool suits--
two for a hundred.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.685
Got any
suggestions?

00:19.687 --> 00:24.523
Well, at first glance, I see
two gunshot wounds to the chest,

00:24.525 --> 00:27.092
One directly
over the heart.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.028
(phone rings)

00:31.064 --> 00:33.065
Write it up.
Let's get him back.

00:33.067 --> 00:35.334
Man:
I opened this place
six years ago.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.536
People call me "mr. Spiffy."

00:37.538 --> 00:41.106
Well, why don't we just start
with sergeant dawson.

00:41.108 --> 00:44.376
He was over there,
um, looking for a shirt.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.678
All he wanted was a shirt.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.114
I got... I got
the shirt part.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.683
So... What happens next?

00:51.685 --> 00:54.553
A guy comes in
with a mask and a gun,

00:54.555 --> 00:58.424
And he's screaming at me to give
him the money in the drawer.

00:58.426 --> 01:01.293
And I was gonna do it...

01:01.295 --> 01:03.629
But sergeant dawson intervened?

01:03.631 --> 01:06.098
Yeah, he went for the gun.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.168
And the robber shot him
and ran off.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.104
Hey, you all right?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.739
(clears throat)

01:13.741 --> 01:15.674
You know, the body's
gonna be removed shortly,

01:15.676 --> 01:17.142
So why don't you just

01:17.144 --> 01:18.210
Take a minute.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.645
I'll be right back.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.213
(camera shutter clicks)

01:21.215 --> 01:24.083
(whistles)
I got out just in time.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.452
Mr. Spiffy's
about to lose his lunch.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.454
I see that victim-
sensitivity training

01:28.456 --> 01:29.755
Really paid off.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.590
Tony:
I think somebody's been spending

01:31.592 --> 01:33.459
A little too much time
watching bette midler movies.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.694
Delilah have you sit down
and watch <i>beaches</i> again?

01:35.696 --> 01:36.862
Mcgee:
Leave her out of it.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.697
Oh...
No other
witnesses.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.299
Metro has seen
three armed robberies

01:40.301 --> 01:41.800
In the area this month.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.369
Six feet, ski mask,
working alone?

01:44.371 --> 01:46.805
Mcgee: I'll have metro
send over the files.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.674
(phone rings)

01:48.676 --> 01:49.875
(beep)

01:49.877 --> 01:55.180
Hey, dad. I'm in the middle
of something. Can it wait?

01:55.182 --> 01:56.415
Uh, sir, this is
officer mitchell,

01:56.417 --> 01:57.549
Howard county pd.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.251
Apologies for the confusion.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.787
You were the only one
programmed into the phone.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.622
Uh, jackson gibbs
is your father?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.457
Yeah. Yeah. Is he okay?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.658
Uh, well, sir, he...

02:06.660 --> 02:08.227
Jackson:
I know my rights.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.628
I'll report you so damn fast,

02:09.630 --> 02:12.564
Your tears won't have
time to hit the floor!

02:12.566 --> 02:14.299
Oh, yeah. You have him.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.634
Mitchell:
Uh, yes, sir, we do.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.369
And I'm afraid
there's been an incident.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.837
You think I'm kidding?

02:18.839 --> 02:21.240
(pounds table)
show me what law I broke!

02:21.242 --> 02:24.176
Show me!

02:56.576 --> 02:59.511
Tony: Boss call you
from the road?
Nope.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.547
Hmm, me, neither.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.849
So here's what
we have to go on.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.185
Jackson had a run-in with
law enforcement in maryland.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.520
It's not so bad that he's dead,
but it is so bad that gibbs

03:08.522 --> 03:10.289
Had to pick him up.
Something like that.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.525
I'm thinking the
old man got busted with
a lady of the night.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.861
I can't even look at you
right now.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.429
It's either that
or he was trying

03:17.431 --> 03:19.231
To buy some kind
of illegal exotic pet.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.200
Those are your
two choices?

03:21.202 --> 03:23.368
Look, jackson's older,
he's lonely.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.704
A monkey could be tempting.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.372
What is with you lately?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.874
Me? (chuckles)

03:28.876 --> 03:30.342
Tim...

03:30.344 --> 03:32.711
You systematically
ate my yogurt all week.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.380
Well, if you don't
want me to eat it,
then write your name on it.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.515
I shouldn't have to, tim.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.750
You don't deserve yogurt,
you know that?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.686
All you do
is bash people--

03:40.688 --> 03:42.521
Me, the suit guy, jackson.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.357
Okay. I got it.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.292
Thanks for setting
me straight.

03:47.294 --> 03:50.362
You are the wind
beneath my wings.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.898
What is this?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.367
Oh, uh, case files
from... Metro.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.868
Other robberies in the area.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.870
Yeah, why are they
on my desk?

03:58.872 --> 04:01.406
Uh, because I would like you
to go through them

04:01.408 --> 04:03.742
And see if you can find
any links to our homicide.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.910
(laughs quietly)

04:04.912 --> 04:06.778
Are you taking point?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.313
I am.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.382
That's insane.
There's only two of us here,

04:10.384 --> 04:12.584
And gibbs'll be back
in a few hours.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.354
Go through the files... Probie.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.757
Mitchell:
<i>This never is easy.</i>

04:18.759 --> 04:21.426
I know what losing a license
can do to a person.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.962
Well, if his eyes are that bad,
you didn't have a choice.

04:23.964 --> 04:28.467
Your father told me you were
gonna get me in my sleep.
(laughs)

04:28.469 --> 04:29.968
This is him.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.004
Listen, uh,
I appreciate

04:32.006 --> 04:35.040
You going the extra mile.
You know, the same
thing happened

04:35.042 --> 04:37.509
To my father when he
reached a certain age.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.578
It never is easy.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.514
Leroy!

04:42.516 --> 04:44.316
(groans)

04:44.318 --> 04:46.518
Forget my car.
We'll get it later.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.819
Let's use yours.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.354
Dad, slow down, okay?

04:49.356 --> 04:51.990
Oh, and I'm gonna get
my license back, too, later.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.292
Bunch of idiots.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.427
Come on, we need
to get on the road.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.029
Take a breath.
Tell me what happened.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.666
I hit a parked car.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.302
Stop the presses.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.836
I asked what happened, dad.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.973
(sighs)
I got off the highway
to get some gas,

05:07.975 --> 05:10.709
And the gas station
was closed.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.377
(sighs)

05:12.379 --> 05:16.348
I got... Turned around somehow.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.418
So I took off
my driving glasses
and I put on

05:19.420 --> 05:22.921
My reading glasses
to check the map.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.323
And I...

05:24.325 --> 05:27.492
I bumped into
a hatchback.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.061
All right? I mean...

05:29.063 --> 05:30.696
I can see fine.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.431
Now, can we go?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.399
What's so important
about maryland?

05:34.401 --> 05:36.401
Nothing. I was
just passing through

05:36.403 --> 05:40.372
On my way to pick you up.

05:40.374 --> 05:43.041
Going to see
an old war buddy.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.976
Eden, north carolina.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.847
I want you to come with me.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.615
Dad...

05:50.617 --> 05:52.918
You could've called first, okay?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.453
Eh!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.655
(chuckles): And give you
a chance to say no?

05:58.358 --> 06:00.459
Look, leroy...

06:00.461 --> 06:02.627
My buddy...

06:02.629 --> 06:05.030
I got word that he's dying.

06:07.100 --> 06:11.002
I got things
I need to say to him.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.908
(engine roaring)
(groaning)

06:16.910 --> 06:21.012
Golden angel four
to all stations-- I've been hit.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.814
Do you read me? Over.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.550
(sighs)

06:27.487 --> 06:31.490
I was helping you build
a model plane,

06:31.492 --> 06:33.125
And you asked me
about the war.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.626
Do you remember
the story

06:34.628 --> 06:36.128
I told you?

06:36.130 --> 06:37.629
Yeah, of course.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.399
This guy was the other pilot.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.534
Walter beck.

06:42.536 --> 06:46.104
Do you remember that name?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.473
He was the one.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.009
Dad, I-I'm right in the middle
of an investigation.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.412
I can get someone
to take you there.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.946
I don't need to be taken.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.116
I want you to meet him.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.986
Leroy...

07:00.988 --> 07:04.489
I need you to do this.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.058
Please.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.127
â™ª

07:11.597 --> 07:13.198
Well...

07:13.200 --> 07:16.034
What's the best way
to get to eden?

07:17.003 --> 07:18.770
Let's go.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.216
Hey, tony,

07:31.218 --> 07:32.951
Have you heard
from gibbs?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.519
Not yet.

07:34.521 --> 07:37.022
Dare I ask what's
in the box?
Gibbs.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.990
Whenever he's close enough
to my computer,

07:38.992 --> 07:42.060
I record his catchphrases
for posterity,

07:42.062 --> 07:45.464
And now I have packaged them in
this portable and stylish box.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.999
Gibbs (recorded):
What do you got, abbs?

07:48.835 --> 07:50.502
In english.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.903
(chuckles softly)

07:53.172 --> 07:54.973
It's broken.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.608
No.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.910
That's when
he's just staring at you.

07:59.712 --> 08:02.113
Abbs, the case.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.548
Sergeant dawson. Okay.

08:03.550 --> 08:06.518
Um, the bullets that
were pulled from his body

08:06.520 --> 08:08.253
Are both nine-millimeter.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.956
The striations are consistent
with a glock 17.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.958
Suspect in the other
robberies never fired.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.860
But the witnesses
all had him carrying

08:14.862 --> 08:16.795
A black semiautomatic pistol.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.798
Glock 17 would fit the bill,
and so would

08:19.800 --> 08:21.266
A smith & wesson m&p

08:21.268 --> 08:24.169
(phone ringing)
or a beretta 92...

08:24.171 --> 08:26.238
Oh, is that gibbs?

08:26.240 --> 08:28.540
Tell him I'm making his dad
the best present ever.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.610
I'm gonna go...
Decorate this some more.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.746
Hey, boss.
How's your pops?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.649
Like I said, a minor accident.
He's fine.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.652
No, you didn't say that,
but that's what we figured.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.654
(phone chimes)
one sec, boss.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.024
It's mcgee.
He's really off the rails today.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.259
I'll talk to him later.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.960
No, no, patch him through.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.596
O-okay.

08:53.132 --> 08:56.902
Mcgee?
Yeah. I finished the work
you're too good for, <i>boss.</i>

08:56.904 --> 08:58.637
Great.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.172
Boss?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.173
Yeah?

09:02.175 --> 09:04.709
You're on with both of us, tim.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.711
Okay. I did not know that.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.246
Well, uh,

09:08.248 --> 09:10.582
I looked through metro's files
on the other robberies.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.650
Yeah?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.018
Major elements
line up with ours.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.553
Looks like the same guy.

09:14.555 --> 09:15.787
I could've told you that.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.622
I also created an algorithm

09:17.624 --> 09:19.658
That'll find links
between the cases.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.927
Anything we input on our end
that'll match something

09:21.929 --> 09:24.796
On theirs'll flag.
Hey, mcgee, that's great work.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.231
You got point.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.267
(awkward chuckle)
I mean, well, do we really

09:29.269 --> 09:31.603
Need a point? You'll be
back before we know it.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.338
Change of plans--
I'll be back tomorrow.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.340
Until then, mcgee,
you got point.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.242
Thank you, boss.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.977
Mcgee:
Tony, talk to dawson's mom.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.680
She has insurance questions.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.615
(chuckles)

09:46.085 --> 09:48.587
Is the world still
turning without you?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.322
(starts engine)

09:53.092 --> 09:56.328
(loud music playing)

09:58.064 --> 10:01.633
(turns off radio)
can't concentrate with
all that noise.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.671
When's the last time
you went to the eye doctor?

10:06.673 --> 10:10.775
Looks like we can just go
through dc, I guess.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.178
Aw, dad.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.313
Can we go over
my patient history

10:15.315 --> 10:17.349
<i>After</i> we talk to walter?

10:17.351 --> 10:20.685
Yeah. Sure we can.

10:23.089 --> 10:26.658
Aw, it keeps running
through my head.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.960
How alone I was up there.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.864
The sky's a lonely place.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.033
It's not only lonely.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.403
I was a sitting duck.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.038
No ammo,

10:40.040 --> 10:42.240
Compass all busted up.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.148
Compass is in-op.
Coordinates unknown.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.785
Request assistance.
Do you read me?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.754
(groaning)

10:55.756 --> 10:57.722
(exhales)

10:57.724 --> 10:58.890
Dad.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.093
No, no, I'm fine.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.929
I-I'm just no good

11:04.931 --> 11:06.931
At explaining it.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.434
You don't have to;
you already told me.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.403
Yeah. When you were seven.

11:11.405 --> 11:14.806
It's not something you forget.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.877
I'm guessing you haven't
eaten since yesterday?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.779
Now, don't start with me, huh?

11:20.781 --> 11:24.115
Woman:
<i>After my husband passed,</i>

11:24.117 --> 11:26.751
Michael took care of me.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.953
And now...

11:28.955 --> 11:31.256
(softly):
It's just me.

11:31.258 --> 11:34.159
I need to know if I'll be...

11:34.161 --> 11:37.996
Receiving... Anything.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.364
Well, marines handle that

11:39.366 --> 11:43.068
Through your casualty assistance
calls officer.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.203
I see.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.239
Thank you.
I-I have the number.

11:48.241 --> 11:51.142
Why couldn't he have just

11:51.144 --> 11:53.845
Let the man have the money?

11:53.847 --> 11:57.816
Still a marine, even on leave.

11:58.918 --> 12:00.985
He was on leave?

12:00.987 --> 12:02.153
Mm-hmm.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.355
You didn't know that?

12:04.357 --> 12:07.492
Michael never talked
about his work.

12:07.494 --> 12:11.796
But I always knew when he was
in the middle of something.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.799
That's the only thing
that kept him from calling.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.869
Leave started three days ago.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.939
He was in the middle
of something.

12:22.341 --> 12:25.210
(softly):
Do you know what he was doing?

12:27.279 --> 12:29.180
Jackson:
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>this is on the way?</i>

12:29.182 --> 12:31.750
Gibbs:
<i>You said yourself it was best</i>
<i>to go through dc.</i>

12:31.752 --> 12:35.053
Well, how long does it take
to get some toast around here?

12:35.055 --> 12:37.055
How long does it take
at your house, dad?

12:37.057 --> 12:39.791
I'm done waiting.
Let's get the coffee to go.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.526
Dad, sit down.
Sit down.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.762
You got to eat.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.431
(sighs quietly)

12:48.134 --> 12:51.302
You order food here
and you don't eat it,

12:51.304 --> 12:53.471
This waitress,
she takes it personal.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.040
I've seen her cry.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.543
(laughs)

12:59.545 --> 13:01.179
Listen,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.882
I tracked down walter
after the war,

13:03.884 --> 13:06.851
And wrote to him to thank
him for what he did.

13:06.853 --> 13:10.955
Never heard back until I got
this in the mail yesterday.

13:13.058 --> 13:15.860
"it seems I'm sick.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.897
"I don't have
much longer.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.331
"soon I'll be

13:20.333 --> 13:24.202
Headed up to the blue sky."

13:24.204 --> 13:26.905
(sighs) now, son...

13:26.907 --> 13:29.340
When I say the way
it has to be,

13:29.342 --> 13:31.843
You got to listen.

13:31.845 --> 13:35.113
Leroy, you need
to work on that.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.282
Okay, dad.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.117
No, that doesn't fly
with me, leroy.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.219
You say two words,
and you expect me

13:41.221 --> 13:44.022
To fill in the rest?
No, I don't expect you
to do anything.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.191
W-will you listen?
I've told you ten times.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.393
Now walter's telling you.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.395
We need to get moving.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.064
I've got things I
got to say to him.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.166
Okay, club sandwich

13:55.168 --> 13:57.235
Times two.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.506
Something wrong?

14:02.474 --> 14:04.209
Looks good. Thanks.

14:04.211 --> 14:09.047
Well, you need anything else,
you know where to find me.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.018
Eat fast.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.288
(door opens)
tony: Ah.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.290
Hey there, sunshine.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.292
What's shaking in
the monkey tree?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.995
(imitates monkey chattering)

14:23.997 --> 14:25.163
Tony!

14:25.165 --> 14:27.232
You in here listening
to yanni again?

14:27.234 --> 14:29.467
I needed some alone time.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.535
Mm.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.537
Tony:
Let me guess, the algorithm

14:32.539 --> 14:34.239
That got you point
is giving you nothing,

14:34.241 --> 14:35.640
And you're scrambling
to make it work

14:35.642 --> 14:37.408
Before I call you out on it?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.309
No.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.244
Mm.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.213
8:57 a.M.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.381
Bring it up.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.649
Why?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.551
Do it.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.187
Tony:
Oh, tim, the algorithm

14:49.189 --> 14:50.889
Isn't working because...

14:50.891 --> 14:52.523
There are no
hidden similarities

14:52.525 --> 14:53.892
Between the other
robberies and ours.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.526
Well, let's say that's true.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.195
What exactly are we looking at?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.330
Bank security cam
facing tate street.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.365
Uh, right here.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.466
Slow that down.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.034
Morning in question.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.335
Gps in sergeant dawson's car

15:04.337 --> 15:06.905
Has him going from his house
to the suit store,

15:06.907 --> 15:08.907
And that's him
on the way.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.109
And    <i>the</i>is an suv.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.044
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.380
Plate's not visible,
but... Still.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.048
Still what?

15:17.050 --> 15:19.117
So there's an suv on the road--
what does that prove?

15:19.119 --> 15:21.586
Nothing.
But the same suv

15:21.588 --> 15:24.155
On two other cameras
kind of proves something.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.691
Dawson was being followed?

15:26.693 --> 15:28.960
Killer tried to make it look
like another robbery,

15:28.962 --> 15:31.562
But he never planned
on stealing anything.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.932
He was there for
sergeant dawson.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.000
â™ª

15:44.576 --> 15:46.577
Here's the thing--
just 'cause you can name

15:46.579 --> 15:49.447
All the parts inside a jet pack
doesn't make you einstein.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.215
That what you're saying?

15:51.217 --> 15:53.518
I'm picking up what
you're laying down.

15:53.520 --> 15:57.488
(chuckling):
Right, maybe
baby einstein.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.457
Listen, something
small just came up.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.558
I got to go.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.493
Uh-huh. Good talking
to you, too.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.362
All right, bye-bye.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.998
Why are you on my phone?
Because it rang,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.100
And I answered it.
Delilah said she's gonna pick up

16:09.102 --> 16:11.102
Your food tonight-- so you're
gonna have dinner together.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.470
Oh, yeah?
Did she also mention

16:12.472 --> 16:14.505
That your head's
too big for your body?

16:14.507 --> 16:16.140
'cause that's what
all of her friends said

16:16.142 --> 16:17.642
When they saw your picture.

16:17.644 --> 16:21.312
Let's just stick
to the case, okay?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.314
All right,
let's stick to the case.

16:24.516 --> 16:25.750
Both (in unison):
Update. Go.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.085
What?

16:27.087 --> 16:30.621
That was before your algorithm
went down the toilet.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.724
Fine. Co-point.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.595
Deal.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.730
Co-point.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.766
I'll go first.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.668
All right, marine sergeant

16:43.670 --> 16:46.237
Michael dawson.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.573
Currently in the middle
of a seven-day leave from

16:48.575 --> 16:51.542
His duty assignment
at joint base anacostia-bolling.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.112
Targeted for reasons unknown.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.748
Bolo's out on the suv
that was following him.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.150
Nothing worth talking about
in his bank records.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.552
He did have one misdemeanor
ten years ago:

17:01.554 --> 17:03.421
Illegal possession
of painkillers.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.423
But his record's been
spotless ever since.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.758
Yeah, the guy was popular.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.527
Huge amount of phone calls
and e-mail buddies.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.662
Yeah, I saw that.
I think we should create

17:11.664 --> 17:14.399
A master spreadsheet of all
of dawson's personal contacts.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.200
Oh, tim, you're a genius.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.702
You should definitely do that.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.405
All right, even though
dawson was on leave,

17:20.407 --> 17:22.507
His mother was convinced
he was tied up

17:22.509 --> 17:23.541
With something work-related.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.510
Now, the file says

17:25.512 --> 17:28.579
His assignment at bolling
was highly classified and he...

17:28.581 --> 17:30.748
Was working for the dcs.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.717
The dcs?

17:32.719 --> 17:36.120
His occupational specialty
was auto repair.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.122
So what would defense
clandestine service

17:38.124 --> 17:40.124
Want with a mechanic?

17:42.528 --> 17:43.628
What are you doing?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.163
I'm bringing in dawson's boss.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.698
It would be awkward
if we both called.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.567
I will let you do that.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.570
Thank you.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.406
(birds chirping)

17:58.377 --> 18:00.111
(exhales)

18:01.547 --> 18:04.682
You could've waited for me
to stop before you got out.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.817
(doorbell rings)

18:05.819 --> 18:07.819
(repeated ringing)

18:09.721 --> 18:11.789
(beeping)

18:12.858 --> 18:14.425
(beep)

18:16.128 --> 18:18.162
(knocking)
hello?

18:19.531 --> 18:21.599
You sure this is
the right address?

18:21.601 --> 18:23.367
Got it off the envelope.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.869
He know you were coming?

18:24.871 --> 18:27.405
Will you keep your shirt on?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.474
He's probably
around back.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.244
The guy didn't know
you were coming?

18:35.314 --> 18:37.315
â™ª

18:47.226 --> 18:49.427
(engine roaring)

19:10.649 --> 19:13.651
(echoes softly):
Thank god.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.653
Nobody's home.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.422
Side door was open.
Place is empty.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.392
He'll be back.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.727
There anybody we can call?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.829
Who do you think's
gonna keep tabs on him?

19:26.665 --> 19:28.766
He's an old man.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.835
Living alone.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.640
He saved me, leroy.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.877
I was flying
in the wrong direction.

19:41.613 --> 19:44.415
He turned me around,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.884
Brought me home on his wing.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.687
Yeah, I know, dad.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.757
I know you got this case.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.961
Just wait with me for an hour.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.397
Okay.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.399
Woman:
<i>"clandestine"</i>

20:01.401 --> 20:03.901
Is a part of
our name, yes, so...

20:05.571 --> 20:07.772
The dcs conducts

20:07.774 --> 20:10.408
Clandestine operations
to ensure national security.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.644
What about dawson?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.546
He was an
incredible asset.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.849
Remarkable person.
His death is...

20:18.851 --> 20:20.918
It hit us hard.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.555
What kind of work was
he doing for you?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.657
I'm afraid
that's classified.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.726
It's compartmented.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.463
But you <i>can</i> tell us the dcs
handpicked an auto mechanic

20:32.465 --> 20:33.898
For some reason?

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
Sergeant dawson did have
that skill set, yes.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.668
Mcgee:
He was with you

20:37.670 --> 20:40.805
For two months-- were
you planning on keeping
him much longer?

20:40.807 --> 20:44.275
I'm confused. Uh, I was
told that sergeant dawson

20:44.277 --> 20:46.410
Was a victim
of an armed robbery.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.981
I'm not quite sure how
this line of questioning
has anything to do

20:49.983 --> 20:52.850
With...
We're exploring all avenues.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.554
Because you think
it was something else?

20:56.556 --> 20:58.022
Mcgee: Ms. Fox,
we're gonna need

20:58.024 --> 21:01.859
Access to any reports detailing
sergeant dawson's work.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.429
You know as well I do
these things take time.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.267
I'll do what I can.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.635
Thank you.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.872
There is one thing.

21:14.874 --> 21:17.008
And now that
you're telling me

21:17.010 --> 21:18.509
"all avenues,"

21:18.511 --> 21:22.780
Sergeant dawson was open
about his past problems.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.382
Drugs?

21:24.384 --> 21:27.885
Before he went on leave,
I noticed a change in him.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.621
He was struggling
with the secrecy.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.758
I saw a change in him.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.661
I thought it was... Stress,

21:36.663 --> 21:37.995
But, uh...

21:39.431 --> 21:42.566
...He could have been
taking something to cope.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.436
Abby:
<i>Karen fox was wrong.</i>

21:45.438 --> 21:49.507
Sergeant dawson's tox screen
came back clean as a whistle.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.941
There are no drugs
in his system.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.878
But I think I know what
sergeant dawson was doing

21:53.880 --> 21:55.713
For the defense
clandestine service.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.682
Dawson's mother is originally

21:57.684 --> 22:00.384
From a village in nigeria,
where some speak

22:00.386 --> 22:01.786
A language called jalaa.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.387
Never heard of it.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.855
That's because
it's almost extinct.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.657
But according
to his file,

22:06.659 --> 22:08.459
Dawson spoke jalaa, too,

22:08.461 --> 22:10.328
And that's why
the dcs recruited him.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.396
If no one speaks the language,
what's the point?

22:12.398 --> 22:13.864
Did you ever hear of

22:13.866 --> 22:16.667
The marine navajo code talkers
of world war ii?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.402
Yeah, they used
their native language

22:18.404 --> 22:20.404
To transmit
tactical info in code.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.840
And now we're looking
to develop a code in jalaa.

22:22.842 --> 22:27.545
According to the dod, there's
this growing terror cell

22:27.547 --> 22:29.347
In nigeria that's
using jalaa code.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.848
I put two and
two together

22:30.850 --> 22:32.717
And, hello, earth-
shattering theory,

22:32.719 --> 22:34.919
Dawson was using his
knowledge of jalaa

22:34.921 --> 22:37.021
To break the terrorist code
for the dcs.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.923
I don't know-- you know
about this terror cell?

22:38.925 --> 22:40.124
Who's your dod source?

22:40.126 --> 22:44.995
Um... I... Know somebody there.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.031
What?
Who do you know at the...?

22:48.834 --> 22:50.801
Delilah?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.103
What, are you two
friends now?

22:52.105 --> 22:53.838
Did she say anything
about my head?

22:53.840 --> 22:56.040
Um, let's just focus, okay?

22:56.042 --> 23:00.077
If dawson was doing all
this really important work,

23:00.079 --> 23:02.980
Then why did the dcs
let him go on leave?

23:02.982 --> 23:05.850
Well, karen fox said he was
having trouble keeping quiet.

23:05.852 --> 23:06.951
Makes him a liability.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.819
You mean...
I mean, foxy lady

23:08.821 --> 23:11.021
Realizes we're not liking
the robbery angle,

23:11.023 --> 23:12.923
So she brings up
dawson's drug history.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.492
Sends us on
a wild goose chase

23:14.494 --> 23:16.961
To buy the dcs time while
they cover their tracks.

23:16.963 --> 23:19.430
(line ringing)

23:19.432 --> 23:20.564
(phone beeps)

23:20.566 --> 23:23.934
Looks like the dcs might have
something to hide, boss.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.537
Okay, on our way back.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.738
Thank you.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.073
Leroy.

23:29.075 --> 23:33.978
Neighbor told me an ambulance
came by early this morning

23:33.980 --> 23:36.147
And hauled him off.
He's at the hospital.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.416
Okay, we'll find out which one,
I'll take you there later.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.518
You're not hearing me.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.819
Dad, the case is bigger
than I thought.

23:41.821 --> 23:46.724
And by the time you close it,
walter will be dead.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.726
I'll have someone take you
to the hospital tonight.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.461
I want you to meet him.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.496
Dad, I'm here, okay?

23:52.498 --> 23:54.064
Yeah.
I tried.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.066
You're here
to sell me on getting

23:56.068 --> 23:57.201
On getting a seeing-eye dog

23:57.203 --> 23:59.103
Who will tell me
when to have lunch.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.971
No, no...
That would make you

24:00.973 --> 24:04.008
I'm not going to apologize
for worrying about you.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.576
All I'm asking you

24:05.578 --> 24:09.146
Is this one time
to be with me.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.116
All right.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.818
Forget it.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.187
Just forget
the whole damn thing.

24:16.189 --> 24:18.456
Take me home.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.484
Okay, campfire, get it going.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.252
Well, newspaper articles
on the real robbery

24:48.254 --> 24:52.790
Give enough info so that
anyone could pull a copycat.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.124
I'm doing background

24:54.126 --> 24:56.760
On all of dawson's personal
contacts right now.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.796
No flags yet, but...

24:58.798 --> 25:01.932
I organized everything into
that master spreadsheet.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.169
What'd it get us?
Nothing.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.204
Mm, hard to believe.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.140
Bolo's not doing
any good, either.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.010
We need to get proactive
about our suv.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.779
Tony, I told you.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.181
I scoured those videos.

25:17.183 --> 25:20.784
Other than that dawson
was being followed.

25:20.786 --> 25:22.286
The key is
the clandestine service.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.522
You think, mctective?

25:24.524 --> 25:27.091
And how do you suggest
we get our hands on

25:27.093 --> 25:30.761
A bunch of reports the dcs is
probably burning as we speak?

25:30.763 --> 25:33.764
Picked up the reports
from the dcs.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.833
They gave them to you?

25:35.835 --> 25:38.002
One copy, stays at ncis.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.204
Terrific.
My copy, dinozzo.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.740
You two can read
at their place.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.608
Thank you, boss.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.578
We get to go and do
an all-nighter at the dcs.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.613
You want breakfast,
bring your own yogurt.

25:49.615 --> 25:52.950
I'm glad to see you again.
Missed you.

25:58.323 --> 25:59.623
Anything?

25:59.625 --> 26:01.258
No record on your
father's friend

26:01.260 --> 26:02.793
Being checked into
any hospitals.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.662
The morgues?

26:04.664 --> 26:05.896
No, nothing.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.199
But... I went looking
for relatives,

26:09.201 --> 26:11.302
And I went to the army
air force's records

26:11.304 --> 26:13.837
To see if I could find
his mother's maiden name.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.773
Boss, there's no record

26:15.775 --> 26:18.709
Of any "walter beck"
serving with your father.

26:26.051 --> 26:27.284
Jethro...

26:27.286 --> 26:29.053
Welcome back.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.721
Thanks for staying, duck.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.690
I hardly noticed
the time.

26:32.692 --> 26:37.027
Sergeant dawson here
is a very intriguing young man.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.896
Yeah? What do we know?

26:38.898 --> 26:42.132
Well, as a teenager,
he was devastated

26:42.134 --> 26:44.301
By the unexpected loss
of his father.

26:44.303 --> 26:47.771
Unfortunately,
he turned to drugs.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.674
Well...

26:50.676 --> 26:52.076
Found his way back.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.677
And then some.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.679
"bravery" was an important
word to him.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.648
And I for one do not doubt

26:57.650 --> 27:00.217
That he possessed
the courage to stand up

27:00.219 --> 27:03.220
To the dcs if he felt
that they were doing wrong.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.356
Oh, dcs got us the reports
in half a day.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.157
No time for a cover-up.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.326
Well, that's good news.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.862
Yeah.

27:14.232 --> 27:16.367
I presume...

27:16.369 --> 27:20.671
The bad news
is closer to home.

27:20.673 --> 27:24.341
There's no right way
to be his son.

27:24.343 --> 27:29.146
Just as there is no right way
for your to act as his father.

27:29.148 --> 27:32.016
The pain of watching
a parent age

27:32.018 --> 27:34.251
Is unlike any other.

27:34.253 --> 27:37.855
I vividly remember
the first time my mother

27:37.857 --> 27:40.958
Needed help brushing her hair.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.028
It's backwards.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.663
(chuckles)

27:45.665 --> 27:47.064
Certainly feels
like that.

27:47.066 --> 27:52.436
But in the end, well,
it's simply life.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.439
They suspended
his license?

27:55.441 --> 27:59.076
Oh, the license
is one thing, ducky.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.183
He lies to me.

28:06.185 --> 28:09.753
About things that matter.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.125
I don't know
what to do with that.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.694
Jethro...

28:16.696 --> 28:19.930
There is only
one way to proceed.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.232
Don't give up.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.902
Keep talking to him.

28:37.749 --> 28:42.352
You get somebody
to drive me home tomorrow?

28:42.354 --> 28:47.224
Mcgee checked the hospitals
and the morgue, dad.

28:47.226 --> 28:51.962
Walter wasn't at either.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.198
What are you
looking for him for?

28:54.200 --> 28:56.433
Trying to pretend
you care now?

28:56.435 --> 29:00.504
Dad...

29:00.506 --> 29:05.476
There was no walter beck
in your squadron.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.077
What's going on?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.413
What do you mean,
"what's going on?"

29:09.415 --> 29:12.249
I'm asking you
to tell me the truth.

29:12.251 --> 29:16.019
Why are you looking for him
in my squadron?

29:23.828 --> 29:25.963
(engines roaring)

29:28.800 --> 29:30.901
Thank god.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.814
(engines roaring)

29:53.958 --> 29:56.860
Walter was the enemy.

29:56.862 --> 29:58.796
He was german.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.233
But he's here.

30:03.235 --> 30:07.471
Yeah, he moved here
after the war.

30:07.473 --> 30:11.875
I told you
he was german.
No.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.511
No, you didn't tell me.
I would have remembered that.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.047
Well, oh...

30:17.049 --> 30:19.483
It was a hundred years ago.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.051
Who knows what I said.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.553
Who knows?

30:22.555 --> 30:24.321
Dad-- german?

30:24.323 --> 30:25.923
It's the most important part.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.157
No, son.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.893
The important thing was...

30:29.895 --> 30:34.565
Is that we were both fliers.

30:34.567 --> 30:38.235
We were brothers up there.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.470
We were the same.

30:40.472 --> 30:44.441
We're all the same.

30:44.443 --> 30:49.279
But we keep fighting each other.

30:49.281 --> 30:52.950
Walter told me...

30:52.952 --> 30:57.554
That he saved me
that day...

30:57.556 --> 31:02.092
Because he wanted to remind
himself who he was.

31:02.094 --> 31:05.929
He's dying,
and all he can see

31:05.931 --> 31:08.565
Is the people he killed...

31:08.567 --> 31:12.636
Over ideas
that weren't even his.

31:12.638 --> 31:17.140
He can't forgive himself.

31:20.144 --> 31:23.647
That's not an easy thing
to do, dad.

31:23.649 --> 31:28.986
I really wanted you to meet him.

31:34.425 --> 31:35.659
(phone beeping)

31:35.661 --> 31:39.329
We start with
the ambulance, all right?

31:41.599 --> 31:45.936
Yeah, we'll find him.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.373
Abbs, the neighbor says
the ambulance

31:49.375 --> 31:50.674
Was white with an orange stripe.

31:50.676 --> 31:53.076
I'll see what I can find.
Yeah. Thanks.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.479
Morning, boss.
Update for you.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.548
Abby was right about
sergeant dawson's assignment.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.385
He was working to break
the terror cell's jalaa code.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.221
Had trouble keeping quiet
because he wanted to warn

32:04.223 --> 32:06.690
His extended family in nigeria
about the cell, but...

32:06.692 --> 32:08.558
He ended up breaking the code
before he went on leave.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.595
Tony: Possibly three planned
acts of terror, meaning...

32:11.597 --> 32:14.131
We have no reason
to believe

32:14.133 --> 32:16.199
That the defense clandestine
service wanted dawson dead.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.201
Well, you two sound like
you had a good night.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.569
It was a great night.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.305
You know, dcs has
this fantastic

32:21.307 --> 32:23.407
Reading room with
a 60-inch flat screen.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.442
After we finished
our reports,

32:25.444 --> 32:27.344
We just kicked back
for a minute.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.545
Beaches was on.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.714
Tony:
Bette midler--
she really makes you

32:30.716 --> 32:33.984
Think about...
What's important in life.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.953
I'm going to have
to write that down.

32:36.988 --> 32:41.658
Hey, mcgee, I found this
report on my desk.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.328
Oh, uh, yeah.
I left that for you.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.229
It's, um, it's a list of
dawson's personal contacts--

32:46.231 --> 32:47.698
Master spreadsheet.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.132
It's not important.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.703
Only two people on here
called his work phone:

32:52.705 --> 32:54.638
His mother

32:54.640 --> 32:56.540
And some guy named
aaron connolly.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.141
Well, I put connolly
in the "x" group,

32:58.143 --> 33:01.244
Which means we have no evidence
as to how he knew dawson.

33:01.246 --> 33:04.381
So what made him special enough
to have dawson's work number?

33:04.383 --> 33:06.416
It's what I'm asking, dinozzo.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.185
Aaron connolly, 24.

33:08.187 --> 33:11.254
Dui last year;
otherwise he looks clean.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.255
Wouldn't hurt to talk to him.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.024
Okay, let's bring him in.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.525
Uh, wait. Boss?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.160
When he got his dui,
connolly was driving

33:17.162 --> 33:18.495
An suv borrowed from a relative.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.063
Our suv?

33:21.032 --> 33:22.766
Mcgee:
Same make and model.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.435
Tracking down connolly.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.771
Got a home address.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.708
Aaron connolly! Ncis!

33:34.245 --> 33:36.313
Clear.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.648
(grunting)

33:41.252 --> 33:43.053
Hey, freeze!

33:43.055 --> 33:43.754
Tony:
Take it easy, connolly!

33:43.756 --> 33:45.756
Take it easy!

33:45.758 --> 33:47.491
I didn't want it!
I didn't want it!

33:47.493 --> 33:48.425
You okay, tim?

33:48.427 --> 33:50.060
Yeah, I'm okay, boss.

33:50.062 --> 33:51.528
I didn't want it.
I-I didn't want michael dead.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.796
I didn't want it.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.065
(handcuffs clicking)

34:05.343 --> 34:07.477
(door opens)

34:07.479 --> 34:10.280
How's your back, tim?

34:10.282 --> 34:11.648
It's had better days.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.316
Closet launch
was a cheap shot.

34:13.318 --> 34:14.785
We get anything?

34:14.787 --> 34:17.454
They tore his place apart--
no murder weapon.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.622
Must've tossed it.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.590
What was he on?
Bath salts?

34:20.592 --> 34:21.625
(door opens)

34:21.627 --> 34:23.193
Marijuana and pcp.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.261
(door closes)

34:28.699 --> 34:31.701
I just needed
to relax, you know?

34:31.703 --> 34:35.072
I didn't know
the weed was laced.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.107
I-I don't even know what I did.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.643
You assaulted
a federal agent.

34:41.712 --> 34:45.348
You said that you didn't
want michael dead.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.686
Where's the weapon
you used to kill him?

34:51.589 --> 34:53.557
I didn't kill him.

34:53.559 --> 34:56.760
You followed him to the
store in your uncle's suv.

34:56.762 --> 35:00.297
That's the same car that's
sitting in your driveway.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.500
That you driving
or not?

35:03.502 --> 35:05.335
Hey!

35:05.337 --> 35:06.670
Is that you?

35:06.672 --> 35:09.206
Yes.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.674
But I-I didn't kill him.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.509
He was my friend.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.444
He was my sponsor.

35:16.180 --> 35:19.716
Narcotics anonymous.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.351
Heroin.

35:26.891 --> 35:30.327
I had two months clean.

35:30.329 --> 35:34.364
Then I lost my job,
and it got bad.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.667
Michael took leave
t-to help me through it.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.670
He wasn't like me anymore,
but, um...

35:40.672 --> 35:43.306
He was always saving me.

35:45.209 --> 35:47.777
What happened that morning?

35:47.779 --> 35:51.748
If I tell you, someone could...

35:51.750 --> 35:53.350
Someone could come after me.

35:53.352 --> 35:54.651
Aaron.

35:54.653 --> 35:58.355
This is your turn
to help him.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.790
I broke.

36:00.792 --> 36:05.729
I showed up at his place high,
and it crushed him.

36:05.731 --> 36:09.699
He took my stash,
got in his car and drove off.

36:09.701 --> 36:13.303
I thought he would throw the bag
in a dumpster somewhere.

36:13.305 --> 36:16.239
That's not
where he was going.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.775
He went to see my dealer.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.678
By the time I caught up to him,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.748
He was threatening
to turn the guy in.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.616
Who's the dealer?

36:26.618 --> 36:30.220
(voice breaking):
He shot michael.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.222
He shot him, and I ran.

36:32.224 --> 36:35.358
Wait, the dealer
was in the store?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.894
He owns it.

36:39.730 --> 36:40.897
There's nothing here.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.767
Back room's clean.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.569
What did I tell you?

36:51.409 --> 36:53.843
What?

36:53.845 --> 36:55.812
What are you doing?! You can't
just throw those on the floor!

36:55.814 --> 36:57.347
Sir, sir, sir, you need
to stand back here.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.717
Keyhole.

37:01.819 --> 37:03.720
Key, please.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.793
Thank you.

37:17.835 --> 37:19.903
(chuckles):
Oh, my.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.905
What have we here?

37:22.907 --> 37:24.874
Okay.
(handcuffs clicking)

37:24.876 --> 37:28.878
I'm copping to the heroin,
but I did not kill that guy.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.449
No way.

37:33.818 --> 37:36.353
Glock 17.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.921
Tim, what was
the murder weapon again?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.824
Glock 17, tony.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.827
Looks like mr. Spiffy here
is about to lose his lunch.

37:45.797 --> 37:49.733
Okay, first of all, we caught
sergeant dawson's killer, yay.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.001
And second of all,
first alert.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.636
Huh?

37:52.638 --> 37:53.803
First alert ambulance

37:53.805 --> 37:55.805
Has the only
orange-striped vehicles

37:55.807 --> 37:57.774
That service the eden area.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.809
They are a private
company that do

37:59.811 --> 38:02.279
Both emergency and
nonemergency transport.

38:02.281 --> 38:05.949
Right, so we can assume that he
hired them for a non-emergency.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.017
You call them?

38:07.019 --> 38:09.519
Yeah.

38:09.521 --> 38:12.856
When I called them and asked
if they had transported

38:12.858 --> 38:14.824
A walter beck
yesterday,

38:14.826 --> 38:17.594
They asked me if it was
case-related, and...

38:17.596 --> 38:18.795
You couldn't lie.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.996
Exactly.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.866
So they weren't allowed
to tell me anything.

38:22.868 --> 38:26.369
To make matters worse,
I haven't gotten anything

38:26.371 --> 38:27.604
Off walter's letter.

38:27.606 --> 38:28.805
I mean, there's
no watermark,

38:28.807 --> 38:31.775
No special ink magic,
nothing.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.943
Abbs, you tried, okay?

38:33.945 --> 38:37.047
Yeah, but, gibbs, it's like,
every time I read this,

38:37.049 --> 38:39.449
I feel like it's asking
to be answered.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.418
You know, if walter knew
that he was moving away,

38:41.420 --> 38:43.920
Then why wouldn't he
include some kind of

38:43.922 --> 38:45.388
Forwarding address
or-or something?

38:45.390 --> 38:46.523
It doesn't make sense.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.657
"to the blue sky.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.492
I'll be headed..."

38:49.494 --> 38:51.561
"up to the blue sky."

38:51.563 --> 38:53.963
That's the problem when
people write in all caps.

38:53.965 --> 38:57.000
A regular old blue sky
can end up being...

38:57.002 --> 38:58.802
Bingo.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.937
The blue sky hospice.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.439
Located...

39:03.541 --> 39:05.875
...Nine miles north
of walter's house.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.511
Wait, gibbs.

39:08.513 --> 39:11.648
Can you give this
to your dad for me?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.483
Yeah.

39:13.485 --> 39:14.718
Sure.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.686
Thanks, abbs.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.891
Never seen a hospice before.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.961
Dad, I got a
proposition for you.

39:26.897 --> 39:28.698
My house is big.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.568
It's too big
for one person.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.002
It does not make sense,

39:33.004 --> 39:35.372
You being up in
stillwater all alone.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.806
Especially
without a license.

39:36.808 --> 39:39.909
Well, I'm gonna take
the damn eye test

39:39.911 --> 39:41.678
And get my license back.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.914
Now, that's the end of it.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.917
I'm still your father.

39:49.887 --> 39:51.121
Yes, you are.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.758
(sighs)

39:54.760 --> 39:57.560
I appreciate the offer, leroy.

39:57.562 --> 40:00.130
I do.

40:00.132 --> 40:05.869
Maybe I'll take you up on it
when I start getting old.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.972
Why do you want me to
meet him so bad, dad?

40:08.974 --> 40:11.441
(sighs)

40:11.443 --> 40:13.543
You ready?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.612
(door creaks)

40:31.195 --> 40:33.096
Jack gibbs.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.967
You came.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.041
(sobbing softly)

40:45.043 --> 40:47.911
(plane engine roaring)

40:47.913 --> 40:49.979
(engine sputtering)

40:49.981 --> 40:51.748
Man (over radio):
This is raydon tower.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.583
Do you read? Over.

40:53.585 --> 40:56.486
Raydon tower, that's a roger.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.188
(engine sputtering)

41:17.775 --> 41:21.511
Raydon tower,
this is golden angel four.

41:22.980 --> 41:25.048
I'm headed home.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.656
(sniffles)

41:33.658 --> 41:36.059
You got my letter.

41:36.061 --> 41:39.863
Yes.

41:39.865 --> 41:45.101
Walter, I want to talk to you
about that.

41:47.137 --> 41:49.205
And I want you to meet someone.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.113
Walter,

41:57.115 --> 42:00.116
This is my son, leroy.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.117
Hi.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.185
Sir.

42:03.787 --> 42:05.788
Jackson:
Walter,

42:05.790 --> 42:09.192
Nothing can make up
for the lives we took.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.593
We both know that.

42:13.063 --> 42:17.166
But what you did
was more than you know.

42:19.270 --> 42:20.303
(sniffles)

42:20.305 --> 42:23.573
You made my boy possible,
walter.

42:23.575 --> 42:26.109
And he helps
people, walter.

42:26.111 --> 42:28.177
He's a good man.

42:34.251 --> 42:37.053
He's the best person I know.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.829
(weakly):
Jack...

42:46.831 --> 42:49.198
Thank you.

42:51.168 --> 42:52.969
Thank you.
