00:06.007 --> 00:09.332
I'm so glad I graduated high school.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.640
You know, it is such a relief to
finally know everything.

00:13.864 --> 00:16.341
I can't believe I graduated a year ago.

00:16.841 --> 00:19.335
It's, like, I feel like
I've done nothing.

00:20.023 --> 00:22.782
Man, time really flies when
you take two naps a day.

00:23.978 --> 00:26.139
Well, I wouldn't say you've
done nothing. I mean, you've...

00:27.165 --> 00:29.209
Wow, you really
sat on your ass.

00:30.528 --> 00:32.588
Yep, Forman, we've
all passed you by.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.319
I'm running a record
store. Donna's a deejay.

00:35.347 --> 00:36.666
Kelso's a cop.

00:39.033 --> 00:40.747
Even Fez has a job now.

00:40.955 --> 00:43.498
What is it again, man, uh, shower girl?

00:45.052 --> 00:46.220
Makeup lady?

00:47.485 --> 00:48.653
Shampoo boy!

00:50.979 --> 00:51.977
Eh, I was close.

00:52.777 --> 00:56.695
Wait a second. This mean I'm
the loser of the group now?

00:57.345 --> 01:00.220
You are the one that's still
living with your mommy.

01:01.172 --> 01:03.103
Man, you're still
living with your mommy.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.819
Not for long. Me and Fez are
looking for apartments.

01:05.847 --> 01:10.197
Then the only time I'll see my mom is when
she's doing my laundry, cooking my meals,

01:11.252 --> 01:12.703
taking me to the dentist.

01:13.978 --> 01:15.937
Well, Eric, I feel kind of bad.

01:15.965 --> 01:17.951
You wouldn't even be
thinking about this kind of stuff

01:17.985 --> 01:20.784
if you weren't caught in the
blinding light of my bright future.

01:21.918 --> 01:24.341
You know, the scary thing is,
if one year went by this fast,

01:24.359 --> 01:26.837
imagine where Eric is
gonna be in ten years.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:37.629 --> 01:40.378
Thanks for going with me to
the "Star Trek" convention,

01:40.623 --> 01:41.603
"Uhura."

01:45.521 --> 01:47.094
You can call
me Donna now.

01:52.894 --> 01:54.091
That's good, Fez,

01:55.550 --> 01:57.487
but I think it's gonna
be more like this...

02:04.268 --> 02:06.844
Thanks for going with me to
the "Star Wars" convention,

02:07.277 --> 02:07.974
"Leia."

02:11.778 --> 02:13.229
You can call
me Donna now.

02:20.597 --> 02:22.396
No, man. You're both wrong.

02:22.424 --> 02:24.684
Actually, it's gonna go like this...

02:32.014 --> 02:34.585
thanks for going with me to
the "Star Wars" convention,

02:35.009 --> 02:35.695
"Leia."

02:41.252 --> 02:43.456
You can call
me mom now.

02:48.239 --> 02:48.880
Whoa.

02:49.153 --> 02:52.214
Eric, they're joking
around. It's funny.

02:52.242 --> 02:54.746
No, Donna, it's
not funny. In fact...

02:55.471 --> 02:57.468
It's completely possible!

Every one of my friends has
a career path except for me.

03:38.045 --> 03:39.862
Even Kelso. Kelso...

03:39.880 --> 03:43.356
the kid who thinks that
NATO Is japanese for "neato."

03:45.174 --> 03:47.567
You know, it's just not fair.

03:47.614 --> 03:50.280
I mean, you sleep late,
and you watch TV all day...

03:50.308 --> 03:52.408
the job offers
should be rolling in.

03:55.016 --> 03:58.585
Why don't you look into that
chiropractic school I suggested?

03:58.604 --> 04:00.826
They're having an
enrollment seminar.

04:00.854 --> 04:04.348
You know, a chiropractor
is a very prestigious job,

04:04.367 --> 04:08.472
especially if you move someplace
where they don't have real doctors.

04:10.449 --> 04:11.023
Well,

04:11.692 --> 04:14.805
I guess chiropractor is as good
as anything I've come up with.

04:15.392 --> 04:17.611
I have wasted an entire year

04:17.870 --> 04:19.524
doing absolutely nothing.

04:19.752 --> 04:20.445
Hey,

04:20.619 --> 04:24.212
how about a job stating the obvious,
'cause you're getting really good at that.

04:30.366 --> 04:31.047
So

04:31.317 --> 04:33.207
you're gonna be
a chiropractor, huh?

04:33.478 --> 04:37.669
All right, every chick patient that you have,
you have to tell her the problem is her tailbone.

04:37.959 --> 04:40.578
Tthat way you get to
grab around on her butt.

04:41.599 --> 04:44.782
Kelso, I'm doing this' cause
I want to help people.

04:45.275 --> 04:47.436
A handful of ass
is just a perk.

04:49.538 --> 04:54.259
Okay, so I just want to remind everybody about
my graduation dinner party tomorrow night.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.502
Be there by 6:00
for the champagne toast.

04:56.584 --> 04:58.826
Free champagne?
I'm in!

05:00.247 --> 05:01.914
Free toast?
I am in, too.

05:03.402 --> 05:05.022
Jackie, a dinner party?

05:05.057 --> 05:06.795
Can't we do something fun like

05:06.924 --> 05:09.813
drive up to the border and
throw stuff at Canadians?

05:11.527 --> 05:14.331
I mean, they never fight
back, 'cause they're Canadian.

05:15.951 --> 05:20.754
Steven, this dinner party is an important
event to mark my entrance into womanhood.

05:21.234 --> 05:24.628
Didn't that happen three years ago
in the backseat of Kelso's car?

05:29.043 --> 05:31.778
I love talking about
this in front of Hyde.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.586
Yeah, me too, 'cause
that way, I can do this.

05:36.007 --> 05:37.557
Too hard!

05:40.551 --> 05:41.408
Michael,

05:41.690 --> 05:44.893
I circled some apartment
listings for you and Fez.

05:45.116 --> 05:48.991
I found a great apartment for
Janet Meyers after her divorce.

05:49.014 --> 05:52.036
It has a murphy bed for
when her kids come to visit.

05:52.529 --> 05:53.867
They never do.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.580
She's in AA

05:58.996 --> 06:01.015
Look at all these
places for rent.

06:01.098 --> 06:03.810
Man, I hope we can find one that's
got everything my baby needs.

06:04.033 --> 06:06.299
Oh, Kelso, you're
always putting me first.

06:14.073 --> 06:16.762
Not you, moron!

06:17.654 --> 06:19.779
Betsy.
My daughter.

06:20.645 --> 06:24.543
It's amazing how one tiny person
has changed my life so much.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.727
You changed mine, too.

06:36.869 --> 06:41.497
Dr. Don loves being a
chiropractor, and you know why?

06:41.802 --> 06:48.988
Because the cosmos has ordained
Dr. Don to make people feel good.

06:52.058 --> 06:56.566
Do you get the feeling that dr. Don writes
himself a few too many prescriptions?

06:58.128 --> 06:59.666
No, I think he's cool,

06:59.690 --> 07:01.768
and I love the way he
calls himself Dr. Don.

07:01.803 --> 07:03.625
Eric's impressed.

07:05.257 --> 07:12.122
Within these hands lies an unexplainable magic
that melts away the troubles of the world.

07:12.168 --> 07:18.004
And Dr. Don will prove it to you by demonstrating
on this attractive blonde in the front row.

07:18.971 --> 07:23.435
No, I'm only here to make sure my boyfriend
doesn't sneak out to play "Space Invaders."

07:24.330 --> 07:26.513
Step on up here, little lady.

07:26.643 --> 07:29.496
Donna, come on. I need to
make a good impression.

07:29.555 --> 07:32.148
Look, one little medical
experiment isn't gonna kill you.

07:33.052 --> 07:35.881
Come on. Here we go,
right on up here.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.067
And

07:37.784 --> 07:40.623
now just relax.

07:40.800 --> 07:46.013
Dr. Don has been known to
cause patients serious joy.

07:48.796 --> 07:49.688
Wow.

07:50.252 --> 07:51.872
That felt great.

07:51.895 --> 07:54.195
Uh-oh. I think your
tailbone's out of whack.

07:54.219 --> 07:56.133
All right, show's over.
No. Come on.

08:04.115 --> 08:09.223
Man, we gotta have this place. It's perfect for the
baby. It already smells a little bit like throw up.

08:09.868 --> 08:13.954
Mrs. Forman, you found us a great
apartment. I could just kiss you.

08:14.529 --> 08:15.833
Can I kiss you?

08:18.439 --> 08:21.128
Bob, what are
you doing here?

08:22.679 --> 08:24.546
You're selling your
house because you're broke.

08:24.569 --> 08:28.562
I knew something was wrong when I
didn't see you wearing fur this winter.

08:29.196 --> 08:31.920
No, I come to open houses
to meet women.

08:32.342 --> 08:35.207
If a lady's looking for her
own place, she's either single

08:35.231 --> 08:37.450
or running away
from a bad relationship.

08:37.472 --> 08:38.506
Either way,

08:38.611 --> 08:39.539
I win.

08:41.019 --> 08:43.741
Is everything
all right over...

08:44.551 --> 08:45.279
Oh.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.216
It's you.

08:49.365 --> 08:50.351
Fenton.

08:50.375 --> 08:54.096
I'd shake your hand, but I'm afraid
I'd catch some kind of third world herpe.

08:55.399 --> 08:57.795
That's fine. I wouldn't let you
touch me with a 10-foot pole.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.404
I wouldn't touch you
with a 20-foot pole.

08:59.439 --> 09:00.637
You don't even have
a 20-foot pole!

09:00.660 --> 09:03.020
Maybe I'll go buy one just
so I can't touch you with it!

09:08.120 --> 09:09.047
Fez,

09:09.305 --> 09:10.773
Who is this guy?

09:11.302 --> 09:12.476
This is

09:12.981 --> 09:13.920
Fenton.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.374
We are having a feud.

09:18.018 --> 09:18.709
Oh.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.964
Filling out an
application, hmm?

09:22.126 --> 09:25.578
Yes. We we got here first, so
don't even think about applying.

09:25.614 --> 09:28.357
I don't have to.
I'm the landlord.

09:28.498 --> 09:30.377
The lord of the land.

09:30.436 --> 09:34.492
And I'm gonna lord it over
you while your butts land outside.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.449
Mmm, that was clever.

09:39.611 --> 09:40.856
Oh, yeah?

09:41.196 --> 09:46.906
Well, I was gonna give you this $5 to get
the apartment, but now you can forget it.

09:50.206 --> 09:51.850
That was clever.

10:04.259 --> 10:06.032
Too slow, old man.

10:07.957 --> 10:10.799
Fez, if you're not polite, he's
gonna figure out you're living here.

10:14.968 --> 10:16.717
You're living here?

10:16.893 --> 10:19.582
Oh, great.
You blew it, Fez.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.609
Red, he has
nowhere else to go.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.108
Well, know this, Pelé...

10:33.735 --> 10:35.743
You gotta sleep sometime.

10:35.762 --> 10:38.815
And during the war,
when they were sleepin',

10:38.851 --> 10:40.835
that's when I got 'em.

10:44.087 --> 10:45.778
That wasn't too bad.

10:46.597 --> 10:48.229
He called you "Pelé."

10:49.145 --> 10:51.951
He is a terrific
soccer player.

10:52.562 --> 10:55.391
Oh, everything is
set for the party tonight.

10:55.427 --> 10:59.345
Oh, and, Fez, I need you to get there a
little early so you can park everyone's cars.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.693
Sorry, Jackie,
I can't make it.

11:01.717 --> 11:02.480
What?

11:02.504 --> 11:04.752
Yeah, Kelso and I have to
go find an apartment tonight,

11:04.787 --> 11:07.729
or Red is going to
kill me in my sleep.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.131
Yeah, and I can't
let Fez go alone.

11:11.152 --> 11:12.291
Why not?

11:12.361 --> 11:15.461
'Cause then I'll have to go to your
party, which I don't want to do.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.678
No, no, no, Kelso,
you have to go.

11:18.702 --> 11:20.921
If you're not there
and Fez is not there,

11:21.177 --> 11:23.713
it's gonna be pretty damn
obvious that I'm not there.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.823
Okay, Steven, I understand you
don't like dinner parties.

11:27.846 --> 11:29.678
But just let me
make my case.

11:29.713 --> 11:31.192
Ohh! You're going!

11:37.957 --> 11:40.798
You know, the more I
read this chiropractor booklet,

11:40.963 --> 11:44.246
the more I'm starting to see that
this might be the perfect job for me.

11:44.281 --> 11:46.747
Like, it says right
here, you need soft hands.

11:47.827 --> 11:50.892
How many times have you said you
didn't even know I was touching you?

11:53.029 --> 11:53.845
Here.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.627
Let me get a crack
at that neck.

11:56.651 --> 11:57.379
Whoa.

11:57.872 --> 12:00.807
Shouldn't we wait until you're,
like, a little more experienced?

12:00.831 --> 12:02.369
Experienced? Uh,

12:02.757 --> 12:04.974
Donna, I'm on page 12.
Let's do this.

12:09.389 --> 12:10.187
Ow!

12:11.934 --> 12:14.423
Uh-oh. That did
not sound good.

12:14.963 --> 12:16.736
Eric, I can't move
my neck. Fix it.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.247
Okay. I'm sure the
booklet says something about...

12:20.811 --> 12:21.847
Oh, here it is.

12:22.998 --> 12:26.063
Um, okay, I'm gonna need you to
sign a release of liability.

12:35.222 --> 12:36.396
Poor Donna.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.062
I think I hurt
her pretty bad.

12:39.355 --> 12:40.975
Her neck's
stuck, just

12:41.116 --> 12:42.922
tilted over
like this.

12:43.767 --> 12:45.517
Yeah, but on the upside, it looks like

12:45.552 --> 12:48.393
she's really interested in
everything I have to say.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.016
So she's got a bad neck.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.530
Quit whining.

12:53.918 --> 12:56.219
I've gone out with girls that
don't even have necks.

12:57.053 --> 12:58.133
"Hi, Fez."

13:02.129 --> 13:03.338
One time

13:03.373 --> 13:06.673
this girl whipped her head around
to look at me, 'cause I'm hot,

13:06.696 --> 13:09.103
and her neck
just snapped.

13:09.502 --> 13:11.933
And then she collapsed
into the jukebox.

13:12.742 --> 13:13.587
Kelso,

13:14.045 --> 13:15.724
that was The Fonz.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.871
Well, where do you
think they got it from?

13:19.646 --> 13:20.538
Forman,

13:20.750 --> 13:23.272
forget being a chiropractor,
man. The way I see it,

13:23.296 --> 13:26.419
you're diligent,
tidy and detail-oriented.

13:26.830 --> 13:29.166
So I think you should
become a professional

13:29.516 --> 13:30.773
butt wiper.

13:32.088 --> 13:34.013
Oh, come on, man,
this is serious.

13:34.037 --> 13:36.373
Eric, you gotta
start off slow.

13:36.397 --> 13:39.133
First you should be an
amateur butt wiper.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.827
What's wrong
with you two?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.166
So rude.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.631
Eric, I think you
should move to Paris.

13:45.655 --> 13:48.379
That way you can
become a butt wipiér.

14:00.118 --> 14:01.956
How'd the apartment
search go?

14:01.980 --> 14:05.056
Not so good. They can't
find anything they like.

14:05.197 --> 14:07.487
Well, how can
you be picky?

14:07.505 --> 14:09.395
You lived in a jungle.

14:11.368 --> 14:15.242
Any place without a gorilla charging
at you should be paradise.

14:17.349 --> 14:20.390
Red, I don't think he
lived with gorillas.

14:21.247 --> 14:22.351
Did you?

14:23.936 --> 14:26.273
Where the blazes
are you from?

14:28.199 --> 14:29.972
Apparently,
gorilla land.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.490
We found one place yesterday that was
perfect, but we can't get it 'cause

14:34.524 --> 14:37.254
Fez and the landlord
are having a feud.

14:38.179 --> 14:38.934
Well,

14:39.040 --> 14:41.670
you're not spending another
night under my roof.

14:41.694 --> 14:44.347
So come on, we're gonna go have
a chat with this landlord.

14:44.711 --> 14:46.496
What's this guy got
against you anyway?

14:46.531 --> 14:49.467
Who knows? That's like
asking you why you hate commies.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.392
You don't know why.
You just do.

14:53.096 --> 14:55.116
I know exactly why
I hate commies.

14:55.163 --> 14:56.854
They wouldn't stop
shooting at me.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.270
Okay, then something
else you hate.

15:01.264 --> 15:04.434
Oh, you should have
said the Vienna boys choir.

15:06.512 --> 15:08.720
I just want to punch
them in the mouth.

15:15.822 --> 15:17.959
How you doing, my
little buttercup?

15:23.274 --> 15:24.084
Great.

15:25.540 --> 15:28.006
"The brady bunch" is so
much funnier sideways.

15:29.955 --> 15:34.717
Okay, so at my party tonight, I want everyone
to give heartfelt speeches about me.

15:34.775 --> 15:36.689
Okay? So here
they are.

15:39.496 --> 15:41.750
I don't think I can make
it to your party.

15:41.856 --> 15:44.157
Wait, but, Donna,
you have to.

15:44.181 --> 15:47.798
I'm afraid I'm out, too. I gotta
tend to my crooked little flower here.

15:48.984 --> 15:52.155
You know, Eric, calling me cute little
nicknames doesn't make up for what you did.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.070
Okay.

15:53.301 --> 15:55.050
Hey, whatever you say,

15:55.250 --> 15:57.035
my little crazy straw.

15:58.127 --> 16:00.334
I can't believe everyone
bailed out on me.

16:00.358 --> 16:03.904
You know, tonight was really important
to me, and it's like no one even cares.

16:04.292 --> 16:05.207
Jackie,

16:05.971 --> 16:08.530
you look like you really
need to talk this through, huh?

16:09.975 --> 16:11.419
I'll go get Mrs. Forman.

16:17.903 --> 16:19.148
Are you Fenton?

16:19.183 --> 16:20.745
I'm here to talk to
you about the apartment.

16:20.782 --> 16:25.115
Well, you're in luck. It's still
available. And F. Y. I., so am I.

16:26.312 --> 16:28.848
Look, I have a wife.

16:28.907 --> 16:32.222
Well, I have a football,
but I never use it.

16:33.666 --> 16:38.093
Red, I know you said wait in the car, but
Fez keeps playing his crazy bongo music.

16:38.243 --> 16:40.532
It's called jazz,
you philistine.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.691
Oh. You're with them.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.804
Deal's off. I have
to get to yoga.

16:45.828 --> 16:47.436
Hey, can't we talk
about this?

16:47.466 --> 16:49.166
- No.
- See, I told you he was going to be...

16:49.189 --> 16:52.160
just shut it, or I'll
shut it for you.

16:53.088 --> 16:53.886
Well,

16:54.450 --> 16:58.369
you just don't take crap from
anyone, do you, Mr. Man?

16:59.590 --> 17:02.866
I knew this was gonna be a
waste of time. Come on, Fez.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.613
We'll go figure out some
other place to live with the baby.

17:05.813 --> 17:08.372
Baby? No one mentioned
they had a baby.

17:08.407 --> 17:10.002
That...that's so
progressive.

17:10.694 --> 17:11.588
Progressive?

17:11.623 --> 17:15.662
Well, how can I not give the apartment
to two men raising a child together?

17:16.707 --> 17:17.529
Oh.

17:20.593 --> 17:22.460
Yeah, progressive.

17:22.707 --> 17:24.221
Yeah, that's
what they are.

17:24.842 --> 17:27.071
They're as
progressive as hell.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.808
Why, they're
like Newlyweds.

17:30.877 --> 17:32.826
Mmm. I wish I knew
what that was like.

17:32.896 --> 17:36.066
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

17:41.567 --> 17:42.167
Well...

17:42.911 --> 17:46.349
Red convinced Fenton to
give us the apartment.

17:46.372 --> 17:50.564
Yeah, and red seemed so happy. All the way
home, he just kept looking at us and laughing.

17:51.668 --> 17:56.816
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that Red told
Fenton that we knew a lot of chicks.

17:58.002 --> 17:59.869
'Cause Fenton kept
checking me out,

17:59.905 --> 18:02.405
like he could tell that I
knew a lot of chicks.

18:04.843 --> 18:09.164
Eric, I can't believe that you
crippled my angel, my pride and joy.

18:09.199 --> 18:11.183
It kills me seeing
her like this.

18:11.218 --> 18:12.956
Then why are you
bringing her over here?

18:14.013 --> 18:15.490
Oh, I got a date.

18:15.607 --> 18:17.345
I met a lady
at the open house.

18:17.392 --> 18:21.372
She's got crow's feet, but she works in
a sandwich shop, so I bent the rules.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.383
Look, Donna, I'm so
sorry about what happened.

18:27.418 --> 18:31.187
You know, I've been thinking about it, and I don't think
I ever really wanted to be a chiropractor. I was just,

18:31.481 --> 18:33.524
you know,
grasping at straws.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.981
I'd nod in agreement, but,
you know, I'm paralyzed.

18:38.859 --> 18:39.587
Eric,

18:39.810 --> 18:41.854
you know what I'm
realizing about you?

18:42.206 --> 18:44.084
You're not good
at anything.

18:44.991 --> 18:48.232
That's not true, Kelso.
Don't forget butt wiping.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.261
Oh, you know what?
You guys suck.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.408
Whenever you're in trouble,
I don't burn you. I mean,

18:54.619 --> 18:58.270
usually 'cause it's hard for me to think of
things right on the spot, but also 'cause,

18:58.305 --> 18:59.702
you know, I try to help.

18:59.735 --> 19:01.191
That's actually true.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.901
I mean, Fez, remember when you
wanted to learn how to kiss,

19:03.936 --> 19:06.754
and Eric taught you by
sticking m&m's to the mirror?

19:11.221 --> 19:12.794
That never happened.

19:14.943 --> 19:16.364
I know how to kiss.

19:16.657 --> 19:18.160
Oh, shut it, Donna.

19:19.276 --> 19:23.712
Yeah, and, Kelso, how about that time I stayed
up with you all night to study for that math final.

19:23.853 --> 19:27.164
I mean, sure, nothing stuck, but,
you know, I blame nature for that.

19:28.256 --> 19:31.025
Yep, some people
you just can't reach.

19:32.833 --> 19:34.230
You know, Forman,

19:34.265 --> 19:36.367
if you can teach
Fez how to kiss

19:36.402 --> 19:39.535
and Kelso how to do math, you can
probably teach anybody anything.

19:39.993 --> 19:41.801
Why don't you just
become a teacher?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.582
That actually makes
a lot of sense.

19:45.863 --> 19:49.646
I mean, you have all this knowledge
about stuff you have no ability to do.

19:55.341 --> 19:56.457
A teacher?

19:57.313 --> 19:59.344
Well, I do like
helping people.

19:59.379 --> 20:01.446
I mean, I'd love
to help kids.

20:02.503 --> 20:03.383
Yeah.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.260
Like, "Mr. Forman."

20:08.443 --> 20:10.792
That just feels
really great.

20:11.473 --> 20:15.553
Yeah, a teacher. That
just feels so... right.

20:16.434 --> 20:18.958
There it is. Forman's
gonna be a teacher.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.755
This calls for a toast.

20:24.676 --> 20:25.534
All right.

20:27.635 --> 20:28.563
To Forman.

20:29.056 --> 20:30.688
- To Forman.
- To Forman.

20:32.579 --> 20:33.647
What's going on?

20:35.467 --> 20:38.596
You guys are all too busy to come
to my party, and here you are

20:38.631 --> 20:40.052
having a party.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.295
For you.

20:43.891 --> 20:45.215
To Jackie.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.881
- To Jackie.
- To Jackie.

20:49.126 --> 20:50.734
Okay, I don't
believe you.

20:50.769 --> 20:53.399
But as long as I'm center of
attention, I'll take it.

20:54.655 --> 20:57.800
Jackie, grab a beer.
This is a great day.

20:57.835 --> 21:01.111
You graduated. They found an
apartment. And guess what?

21:01.464 --> 21:02.873
I'm gonna be a teacher.

21:02.908 --> 21:04.646
Eric, you know what
you should teach?

21:05.456 --> 21:06.560
Butt wiping.

21:09.296 --> 21:12.032
Fez, that was
really inappropriate.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.850
Eric, you should
teach history.

21:15.331 --> 21:17.445
The history of
butt wiping.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.744
How's your neck, honey?

21:27.779 --> 21:29.494
Oh, it still hurts.

21:29.611 --> 21:30.806
Come over here.

21:31.264 --> 21:34.153
I'm a nurse.
I know what to do.

21:37.699 --> 21:39.164
Take two of these.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.061
Are you sure this
is for neck pain?

21:44.213 --> 21:48.322
Neck pain, headaches, bad days...
they take the edge off of everything.
