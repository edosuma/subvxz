-Hm.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.980
I do still think of you as a person,
not just a body.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.610
I’m so fucking sick of talking to you,
you have no idea.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.162
Nice digs. It's like an opulent dorm room.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.330
[Ruth chuckles]

02:02.455 --> 02:05.125
Yeah, the gold bathroom
is particularly subtle.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.753
That is a pile of clothes, not Sheila,
in the corner, right?

02:09.879 --> 02:11.464
-Right.
-[chuckles softly]

02:11.881 --> 02:14.717
And that's the phone you use
to talk to me.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.219
And this is where you sit.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.471
Which wall do you stare at?

02:19.806 --> 02:20.849
Mm, that one.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.767
Sometimes that.

02:23.726 --> 02:26.437
It’s gonna be a rude awakening,
coming home.

02:26.938 --> 02:27.981
[Ruth] Mm-hmm.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.484
Am I finally gonna get to see
this infamous apartment of yours?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.155
-Ruth?
-What?

02:36.156 --> 02:39.409
Are you gonna kick your illegal sublet
out of the East Hollywood palace?

02:40.577 --> 02:42.370
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about that.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.290
Um, when I get back,
maybe we should look for a place.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.457
Together?

02:46.958 --> 02:49.085
Well... yeah. [chuckles softly]

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
-I know it’s early, but--
-I mean, it’s...

02:51.421 --> 02:52.380
it's pretty early.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.215
Is it? Uh, we talk every night.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.343
-And don't you...
-Yeah. No, yeah, maybe...

02:57.427 --> 02:58.887
maybe it-- it could work.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.348
Let’s get up. Let's go do something.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.017

03:38.885 --> 03:39.761
Little loud.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.554
I'll turn it down.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.139
What's going on with you?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.016
Just starting my day.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.230
Was he cheating on her?

03:50.480 --> 03:53.274
I heard he got a big job,
but I don’t know. He left really fast.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.943
-Really?
-Yeah.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.819
Come on, girls. Back to your rooms.

Yes, Miss Hannigan.

-Hi, Sam.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.161
Ah! Hey, here he is.
How you doing, Russell?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.247
Good, man. Just here to see this one.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.414
You, uh, working out?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.959
Hey, there’s that cameraman's eye, huh?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.835
What, you gonna do some sightseeing or...

04:12.919 --> 04:14.796
Yeah, we’re gonna get something to eat.

04:14.921 --> 04:18.424
Oh, maybe you should take him
to that steak place. Boss him around.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.511
-Okay.
-[sighs]

04:21.719 --> 04:22.762
[Russell chuckles]

04:23.137 --> 04:24.597
Oh, uh-- uh-- uh... Let's just...

04:24.681 --> 04:26.724
-Don't sweat on the suede.
-Okay, okay.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.310
Didn’t want to maybe shower?

04:29.644 --> 04:32.105
Well, that would defeat the purpose
of sweating, wouldn't it?

04:32.188 --> 04:34.983
[Bash] All right, look, business is good,
the show’s doing great.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.443
We're sold out for the next two weeks.
And if we can keep this up,

04:37.527 --> 04:39.237
then the three of us stand
to make a lot of money.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.865
That’s good to know. Maybe I can push
the money into a pile the shape of my son,

04:42.949 --> 04:45.243
-whose childhood I’m missing.
-[chuckles]

04:45.326 --> 04:47.996
Okay, well, I don’t really know
what to say to that. Hi, honey!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.497
-Wow!
-[Rhonda chuckles]

04:49.580 --> 04:52.458
Don’t mind me. I know you’re having
your cabinet meeting.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.879
Um, so Kurt has been doing us a favor
while he’s in town,

04:56.963 --> 04:59.549
but we need a ref for the rest of the run.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.927
I-- I have a list
of available boxing refs,

05:03.761 --> 05:07.849
uh, including a guy who's reffing bouts
over at Caesar’s,

05:07.932 --> 05:10.226
but he’s expensive. If anyone cares.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.937
Man, Keith really fucked us,
leaving without notice like that.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.605
Fucked <i>us? </i>What about Cherry?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.941
Why can’t Sam do it?
He already knows the show.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.484
-[Sam] No.
-That’s a great idea!

05:18.568 --> 05:22.363
Sam, we can both be in the show, huh?
[growls]

05:22.447 --> 05:25.033

-[man] Uh, Mr. Howard?
-[Bash] Yes?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.661
If I could have two minutes of your time.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.246
-[Bash] Sure.
-I'm not just your waiter.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
Uh, my name is Steve Mills. I traffic...

05:32.415 --> 05:33.791
-[Rhonda gasps]
-...in magic.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.045
[exclaims excitedly]
Oh, my God, he traffics in magic.

05:38.004 --> 05:42.091
Here. I want you to select a card.
Say stop whenever you'd like.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.844
-Stop.
-[Steve] Take the card.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.805
-Show your friends.
-[mouthing silently]

05:48.139 --> 05:49.640
-[Steve] And return the card to me.
-I see it.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.768
-Okay.
-[Steve] Remember the card.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.103
-Got it.
-Now watch.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.022
-[snaps fingers]
-That's it.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.399
The card is no longer in the deck.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.068
-It’s gone.
-What?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.695
Now, pick a piece of fruit.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.447
-The orange!
-All right.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.200
-[Sam sighs wearily]
-The orange it is.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.875
[Bash] Come on!

06:17.418 --> 06:18.336
[gasps]

06:19.253 --> 06:21.255
-[Steve] Is that your card?
-[laughing] It is!

06:21.339 --> 06:22.340
It’s the king of spades!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.842
Oh, my God. That is amazing. [laughs]

06:26.719 --> 06:27.929
[Bash] Wow!

06:28.012 --> 06:30.681
-Could I have some more coffee, please?
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.018
Wow!

06:34.102 --> 06:35.937
Um, I would really love to be a part

06:36.020 --> 06:38.106
-of your <i>GLOW</i> show, uh, Mr. Howard.
-[Rhonda laughs]

06:38.189 --> 06:40.525
[Steve] I can do magic before the show,
during the show,

06:40.608 --> 06:43.236
-whatever you’d like.
-It's on a string.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.906
-Okay.
-[lighter clicks]

06:48.991 --> 06:51.327
-[Bash] Careful! [exclaims]
-[blows] My card.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.662
[Rhonda claps]

06:53.621 --> 06:55.123
Thank you so much.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.168
Thank you. We'll let you know
if we need any other... food. Um...

06:59.585 --> 07:01.796
Bash. Hey, Bash?

07:02.046 --> 07:04.257
So, we need a ref, not a magician.

07:04.340 --> 07:07.009
Whatever it is you’re thinking, stop.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.638
Stop it. You stop! No, no.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.390
-[Sam] Oh, God!
-[Rhonda chuckles]

07:12.765 --> 07:14.809
I’m a voodoo priestess.
It’s my goddamn match,

07:14.892 --> 07:16.227
and someone else is gonna be doing
the magic?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.355
Well, [stammers]
do you know any magic tricks?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.859
No, but I’m sure David Copperfield
over there can teach me.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.069
[quietly] Jesus fucking Christ.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.780
-Okay, what the hell is going on?
-It would be pretty cool

07:27.864 --> 07:29.532
to have some actual magic in the ring.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.868
I mean,
Steve could make one of us disappear,

07:31.951 --> 07:33.828
and the other person wrestles,
like, an invisible person.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.372
-Just watch me and Kurt.
-[Kurt] We doing the routine?

07:36.456 --> 07:37.290
Yeah.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.500
Okay.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.836
[both grunting and groaning]

07:42.837 --> 07:43.713
[Kurt chuckles]

07:46.007 --> 07:48.342
Then when we go for the splash,
Steve can do his thing.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.512
[yells, groans]

07:51.637 --> 07:54.432
Then you disappear.
I don't know where you are.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.349
Where are you?

07:55.433 --> 07:57.477
-Where is he? Is he here?
-Where are you?

07:57.643 --> 08:00.062
-[Carmen] Black Magic, where are you?
-[Kurt] What about there?

08:00.730 --> 08:04.525
-You feel the breeze? [blows]
-Okay. Your breath smells.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.110
-Get out of the ring.
-[Kurt] Seriously?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.029
-[Carmen] Yeah, get out.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

08:08.112 --> 08:09.614
[Carmen] Come on.
It’ll spice up the match.

08:09.697 --> 08:10.531
You gotta admit,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.200
it's been a little stale
for the past week.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.326
[laughs]

08:13.409 --> 08:16.370
No, Cherry, I'm not blaming you
or anything. I'm just saying.

08:16.454 --> 08:18.206
Okay, okay. Look...

08:18.331 --> 08:21.042
Hey, Cherry, you're struggling.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.504
Maybe Bash adding this stunt-of-the-week
is a blessing in disguise.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.297
Let Carmen throw herself around the ring,

08:26.380 --> 08:29.217
you go off to the spa, come back
at the end of the show and take a bow.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.844
-And then next week, we're back to normal.
-[chuckles]

08:32.678 --> 08:33.513
Okay.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.307
Y'all want me to disappear so bad, fine.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.771
She's single now?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.902
Are you sure this is how you want to spend
your only day in Vegas?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.446
Are you kidding?
Vegas pawnshops are the best.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.156
Gambling gone wrong.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.534
Oh, my God.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.702
-Yes!
-This place is so depressing.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.038
Are those dentures?

08:59.121 --> 09:02.083
Gambling gone very wrong.
Okay, and they have cameras.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.168
-Oh, there you go.
-Okay.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.671
[down-tempo electronic music playing]

09:11.008 --> 09:11.968
Hm.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.516
[chuckles]

09:24.605 --> 09:27.108
-In the market for a watch?
-Oh, no. [chuckles]

09:27.191 --> 09:30.069
I do have a watch,
but I really shouldn’t keep it.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.779
-It’s not mine.
-You stole it?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.448
What? No. I... [laughs]

09:34.532 --> 09:36.534
It’s a loan. And I should give it back.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.994
I’m here with my boyfriend.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.288
Oh, you want to look at some rings, then.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.331
Hm, who doesn’t love rings?

09:43.708 --> 09:46.377
Oh! [softly]
You meant engagement rings.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.503
-[clerk] Mm-hmm.
-No, I’m good.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.879
[clerk] Come on!

09:49.255 --> 09:50.923
Here. I can do that one for 500.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.091
I don’t... I...

09:52.300 --> 09:53.134
Mm?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.677
-Okay, fine, sure.
-[both laugh]

09:55.511 --> 09:56.887
Wow! It's...

09:57.555 --> 09:58.973
Hm! It's-- It's pretty.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.017
-[chuckles]
-[clerk] Yeah. This is a little more...

10:01.100 --> 10:02.310
-old-fashioned.
-Wow!

[clerk] Square setting.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.479
If you like, uh, yellow stones.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.939
[Ruth] Oh, wow!

10:07.732 --> 10:09.525
-They <i>are </i>pretty.
-[clerk] Yeah.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.819
[chuckles] I mean, these...
I would say, these are the top two.

10:11.902 --> 10:14.447
-They're really just...
-[Russell] You’re engaged to six people?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.657
I was...
I left you alone for, like, two minutes.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.284
[both chuckle]

10:18.367 --> 10:20.953
What do you think? Fan-Tan has a chapel.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.998
-I... I didn't know that.
-[clerk] This is a beautiful girl.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.167
If you don’t buy her a ring,
someone else will.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.335
-Oh, no.
-Oh, okay.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.754
No, he does not need to buy me anything.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.215
In fact, I would like to buy
my wonderful boyfriend this camera.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.760
-[clerk] Excellent, that's a great idea.
-What? No, no, no.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.428
That... What? No, this is too much.

10:37.511 --> 10:41.265
-It's a Nikon. No, I-- I was just looking.
-Well, I want to get it for you.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.683
Well, that's-- that's crazy.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.728
What if we break up,
and I'm stuck with this expensive camera?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.980
Are you imagining we're gonna break up?

10:48.439 --> 10:50.441
No, I'm-- I'm not. No. No.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.360
-I just mean that it's just--
-How much is it?

10:53.569 --> 10:54.695
Three-seventy-five.<i> </i>Hmm?

10:54.987 --> 10:57.782
Oh, that is-- that is a good price. Uh...

10:58.324 --> 10:59.408
Goddammit.

11:00.034 --> 11:00.951
Great.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.204
-[pack unzips]
-[clears throat] Do you take checks?

11:03.621 --> 11:04.580
[clerk] Sure.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.874
[cash register beeps and whirs]

11:06.957 --> 11:08.334
[quietly] Perfect!

11:08.751 --> 11:12.797
“Then get the key for the boat
and row me out over the lake.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.591
I want to see the sun rise.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.802
Is that prudent?

11:18.678 --> 11:19.637
[inhales]

11:19.845 --> 11:23.140
One would think that you were afraid
of your reputation.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.643
-Why not? I don't want to be--"
-Hey, hey, hey.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.978
Hey, Little Match Girl.
What the fuck are you doing?

11:29.021 --> 11:31.691
I quit that stupid acting class,
and I’m teaching myself.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.484
Well, can you teach yourself in your room?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.319
I'm trying to get some work done in here.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.114
I told Ruth I’d stay out.
Russell’s visiting.

11:38.447 --> 11:40.991
[scoffs] Fuckin' Russell.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.580
Hey...
you want to read something a little newer?

11:48.916 --> 11:51.544
“These towns, they’re all the same.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.380
Screen doors flapping on empty houses.”

11:54.463 --> 11:55.589
“What do you mean?”

11:57.299 --> 11:59.427
“I’ve seen mothers
whoring their children,

11:59.510 --> 12:02.888
horses running blind
with their eyes shot out.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.434
It ain’t no world out there
for a decent man.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.645
You tell me why I shouldn’t put a bullet
through my skull

12:09.729 --> 12:12.231
and get the rest I so dearly seek.”

12:12.523 --> 12:15.443
-"I need you."
-"Yeah, and what’s that gonna get me?

12:15.693 --> 12:20.030
That need’s not worth much
when the sun goes down."

12:26.412 --> 12:28.456
-Why doesn’t she respond?
-[lighter clicks]

12:28.789 --> 12:29.707
Huh?

12:30.332 --> 12:31.917
Like, she’s his daughter, right?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.171
Yeah, but he doesn’t know that yet.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.590
Yeah, but she does. How old is she?

12:37.673 --> 12:40.509
I-- I don't... 18, 19.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.387
How long has she known
that he’s her father?

12:45.222 --> 12:46.640
I don’t fucking know.

12:47.057 --> 12:49.560
These are your questions
after reading that scene?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.270
-I mean...
-Uh...

12:52.271 --> 12:53.939
She's... She's mysterious.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.193
No... I know... I...
No, I like... I like mysterious.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.737
I'm just saying the man has a lot of...
[chuckles]

12:59.820 --> 13:00.738
...great lines.

13:00.821 --> 13:01.864
And she just...

13:03.240 --> 13:04.200
like, listens.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.952
-And-- And asks a lot of questions.
-All right, you know what?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.120
Just... Just give me this.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.539
Read-through is adjourned.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.168
I mean, Jesus Christ, one acting class,
and all of a sudden, she's...

13:14.460 --> 13:15.961
Sally fucking Field.

13:16.253 --> 13:18.672
I mean,
this is why I can't let people read things

13:18.756 --> 13:19.757
before they’re done.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.429
Do you think I could be an actor?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.767
Like... this?

13:30.309 --> 13:34.063
Well, I don’t think Miss Julie
ever howled at the moon, so...

13:35.815 --> 13:38.192
Look, I...
Hey, I don’t know what to tell you.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.735
It works great for a wrestling show.

13:40.027 --> 13:43.155
Now, could you get the fuck out?
Because I have some notes to work through.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.788
-[up-tempo electronic music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

13:50.871 --> 13:52.122
[elevator bell dings]

13:58.921 --> 13:59.755
Whoa!

13:59.839 --> 14:02.049
Are you kidding me? Juggling eggs?

14:04.468 --> 14:06.136
Here you go. Her name's Debbie Eagan.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.556
Just call the number on the back,
and she’ll iron out the details.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.016
-[women laughing]
-[Stacey] I fucking love a drag show.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.226
And they love me.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.644
Ah, you would think that.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.980
Oh, please.
I held Sean deLear’s eyelashes for her

14:16.063 --> 14:17.648
while she blow-jobbed us some Valium.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.941
-Oh!
-Oh-oh!

14:20.901 --> 14:21.944
I’ll pass.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.405
You have to come.
Maybe he’ll do Diana Ross.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.949
-He’d better not do Diana Ross.
-Come on, Cherry.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.410
Hey, thanks so much
for letting us have the room this weekend.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.329
-I hope it hasn’t been too much trouble.
-Oh, it’s fine. Sam took me in.

14:32.413 --> 14:36.417
He did? Well, I hope it wasn’t too crowded
with all the hookers. [chuckles]

14:36.500 --> 14:39.128
Actually, we read one of the scenes
from his screenplay.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.468
-Ready for dinner?
-[Ruth] Actually...

14:47.303 --> 14:49.680
let’s go to Icons. I think it’ll be fun.

14:51.807 --> 14:52.892
What is Icons?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.852
[show tune playing on piano]

14:58.772 --> 15:01.317
[cheering]

15:01.859 --> 15:03.777
[entertainer] Thank you! Thank you!

15:03.861 --> 15:06.322
It’s Friday night, ladies and gentlemen!

15:06.906 --> 15:09.408
That’s Judd Melkin on the piano.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.952
-Huh? Whoo!
-[cheering]

15:12.328 --> 15:14.413
It’s hot in here! I’m sweating.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
Oh, this is my... My goodness,

15:16.999 --> 15:19.585
my third show of the evening,

15:20.044 --> 15:22.880
which means, well,
you get to take me out back and shoot me.

15:22.963 --> 15:25.090
[audience laughs]

15:25.257 --> 15:28.010
-Harold Arlen will thank you...
-Switch seats with me for a second.

15:28.093 --> 15:28.969
-Huh?
-Switch.

15:29.053 --> 15:29.929
Why?

15:30.012 --> 15:32.306
[entertainer]
...four walls from your seat. Uh-huh.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.142
No, it's intimate. It's intimate.
[clears throat]

15:35.392 --> 15:38.145
-Oh, but it's just really wonderful...
-How's the visit?

15:38.228 --> 15:40.648
-...to have all of you here.
-Great. We’re at a drag show.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.691
[entertainer] Even those who are here
under court order, right?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.444
-Right here, ladies and gentlemen. Yes...
-Nice camera.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.154
Oh, thanks. It’s got this, uh,

15:47.237 --> 15:49.156
TTL with a flash thing.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.701
...at the gorgeous
Fan-Tan Hotel and Casino.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.620
-[audience cheers]
-Right, who clapped?

15:54.703 --> 15:55.788
Is this your husband?

15:56.121 --> 15:59.625
Oh! Sir, you told her this was the Strip,
didn’t you?

15:59.708 --> 16:00.793
[audience chuckles]

16:00.876 --> 16:04.713
Well, I hate to break it to you, ma’am.
It’s about $200 east.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.675
-[audience laughs]
-[entertainer] So, happy anniversary.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.135
-Did you ask him to read it?
-[chuckles]

16:10.219 --> 16:12.262
[entertainer continues]

16:12.346 --> 16:13.889
He asked you?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.976
-Was it just the two of you?
-[Sheila] Mm-hmm.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.103
[entertainer stammers]
Where's everybody from?

16:19.186 --> 16:22.231
-That's... That's just so odd.
-[entertainer] Ladies.

16:22.564 --> 16:25.693
-Ask him if you can read it, too.
-[entertainer] Ladies! Ladies!

16:25.776 --> 16:26.610
I did.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.237
-[audience laughs]
-Ladies. [whistles]

16:28.821 --> 16:31.615
-Guys.
-[entertainer] Hi!

16:31.699 --> 16:32.533
[chuckles]

16:32.616 --> 16:36.203
Only Cher can talk through my show,
[clicks tongue] and she has.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.496
-[audience laughs]
-So sorry.

16:37.579 --> 16:40.708
You know what? Let's--
Let's-- Let's go over here for a second.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.004
A follow spot is supposed to follow, Bev.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.423
-Fo-- Ah, there we go.
-[audience laughs]

16:47.715 --> 16:50.342
All right. [sighs] Let's go over here.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.052
Hm! [clicks tongue]

16:52.177 --> 16:54.263
One man in a murder of women.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.848
[group laughs]

16:56.348 --> 16:57.224
You a Mormon?

16:57.307 --> 16:59.059
[chuckles]

16:59.143 --> 17:01.979
Ladies, where are your boyfriends?

17:02.062 --> 17:03.647
Your husbands, huh?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.567
Mine's at home with his secretary.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.651
[entertainer] Oh!

17:08.027 --> 17:13.032
Uh, listen, I have heard about you,
the wrestler divorcée.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.116
Eh?

17:14.199 --> 17:16.410
Couldn’t find a boy
to take my bags up all week.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.287
[audience laughs]

17:18.996 --> 17:22.958
I think there’s a nice couple
from Tulsa still waiting for their car.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.461
[audience shrieks with laughter]

17:25.919 --> 17:28.839
No, really, sir. What is your story?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.966
Are you a cult leader? Just...

17:31.425 --> 17:34.178
Uh, uh, I’m, uh, here for the weekend,
visiting my girlfriend.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.430
Oh, the chatterbox!

17:36.680 --> 17:37.848
[audience laughs]

17:37.973 --> 17:39.975
Your boyfriend is only here
for the weekend,

17:40.059 --> 17:44.271
and you brought him to <i>my </i>show? Ah.
[clicks tongue]

17:44.813 --> 17:46.231
Dear, go fuck this poor man.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.691
[audience exclaims and laughs]

17:47.775 --> 17:50.152
[entertainer]
That is what he is here for!

17:50.235 --> 17:53.864
-Go on, get out! Scram. I’m serious!
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

17:53.947 --> 17:56.325
I am banishing you!

17:56.408 --> 17:57.993
-Banishing you!
-[audience chants] Go fuck!

17:58.077 --> 18:00.037
Bev, light their way.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.707
-I wanna hear that elevator ding!
-[audience chuckles]

18:03.791 --> 18:05.501
Oh, and finally,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.338
the most interesting person in the room.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.049
Who let Bob Mackie read Jack London?

18:13.217 --> 18:15.719
[inhales sharply] Where you from?

18:17.012 --> 18:18.180
Where are <i>you </i>from?

18:18.597 --> 18:19.848
Sheila, be nice.

18:21.558 --> 18:26.021
-I escaped from a chemical plant in Texas.
-[scattered laughter]

18:26.105 --> 18:29.066
But this is real. This is deep.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.237
How long have you been a wolf?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.783
How long have you been Barbra Streisand?

18:38.992 --> 18:40.577
Longer than she has.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.579
Since I was a pup.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.290
When I was her, I could sing.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.627
As me, not so much.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.259
Well, this has been fun.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.344
All right, who wants to hear a song?

18:57.427 --> 19:00.180
-[audience cheering]
-[entertainer] Yes! Okay!

19:00.597 --> 19:02.349
He doesn’t let anyone read his stuff.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.060
-Maybe sometimes he does.
-Well, yes, but Sheila?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.980
She’s barely an actress.
I mean, she took one class.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.357
You wanted him to ask you.

19:11.525 --> 19:13.652
Yes. Sam and I are collaborators.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.321
Then, I don’t know,
tell him he hurt your feelings.

19:16.613 --> 19:17.990
I can’t tell him that.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.533
I wonder
if he thought I’d be too critical.

19:19.616 --> 19:22.161
If I’d be ahead of it,
push too much on a first draft.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.788
Or if, in the reading,
he wanted a flatter tone.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.332
-An undecorated read, easier to hear.
-[woman] Drinks?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.418
-No, thank you.
-Jim Beam on the rocks.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.378
Uh, you’re ordering a drink?

19:31.712 --> 19:33.463
For this conversation? Yeah.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.799
[sighs, chuckles softly] Sorry.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.218
I sound like a crazy actress, don’t I?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.511
Yeah, you do.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.724
Uh... You’re not supposed to agree.
[chuckles]

19:43.807 --> 19:46.268
Look, I got a pretty good handle
on who you are, but...

19:46.351 --> 19:48.478
this weekend, you’ve been fucking nuts.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.772
Excuse me?

19:50.856 --> 19:53.275
I’m here two hours,
and you want to move in together.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.860
You try on all these rings.

19:54.943 --> 19:58.488
You buy me this really expensive camera
that you know I cannot afford.

19:58.572 --> 20:00.115
Oh, my God, it was a gift!

20:00.199 --> 20:01.408
And you're obsessed with Sam.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.620
Okay, I am not obsessed with Sam.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.538
Whatever, his stupid screenplay.
Yeah, you are.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.957
And I don’t want to move in together.
I was kidding.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.627
Well, my Portuguese grandfather says
there’s truth in every joke.

20:11.710 --> 20:14.379
Well, my Protestant grandfather
never said anything.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.633
He died of hypertension,
so cheers to our dead grandfathers.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.010
My grandfather's not dead.
I told you that.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.553
I’m sorry

20:21.887 --> 20:24.514
if I don’t remember every moment
from our phone calls.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.600
Then why are we talking every night?

20:26.683 --> 20:27.517
Hey.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.977
Sorry to interrupt.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.104
You, uh... You a photographer?

20:37.945 --> 20:40.322
Over by the stairs might be a nicer photo.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.491
No, we want it right here.
Right where we met.

20:42.574 --> 20:45.202
Yep. The best three weeks of my life.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.579
Even with that foot infection.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.456
[both panting]

20:49.957 --> 20:51.416
[woman moaning passionately]

20:54.753 --> 20:56.630
[disco music blaring]

20:57.839 --> 21:01.218
[sighs] You are loud, you are late,
you said no to drag.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.595
What is going on? Are you quitting?
Because if you are,

21:03.679 --> 21:05.264
as a producer, I need two weeks’ notice,

21:05.347 --> 21:08.809
and Bash will replace you
with a sword swallower, so...

21:09.685 --> 21:10.769
[mouths silently]

21:12.271 --> 21:13.188
Come in.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.651
I will be just a minute.
Um, just make yourself comfortable.

21:23.573 --> 21:25.742
-He's-- He's... He's juggling.
-Don't mind him.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.872
-[TV playing]
-The new match felt great tonight.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.042
I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow,
but the crowd ate it up.

21:35.002 --> 21:35.836
Yeah.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.296
What?

21:39.673 --> 21:42.009
I don’t know how you can do the same show
night after night.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.553
I’m bored, and I’ve only been here a week.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.306
What are you talking about?
We just changed a whole match.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.308
That’s bullshit.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.601
There’s no story lines. No drama.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.687
Well... thanks, I guess.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.439
Look...

21:55.939 --> 21:57.024
I’m proud of you.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.609
You’re better now
than half the guys I work with.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.945
Plus, you’re creative.
You’ve got a mind for this.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.449
You should come on the road with me.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.202
Do some real wrestling.
I think you’re ready.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.706
[sighs] I can’t leave <i>GLOW.</i>
The girls depend on me.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.750
You can do so much more than this.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.252
[sentimental electronic music playing]

22:19.379 --> 22:21.506
[scoffs] Where you off to next?

22:22.299 --> 22:24.885
Phoenix. [sighs] Then Sacramento.

22:24.968 --> 22:29.681
-Bring me back a T-shirt?
-[chuckles softly] I always do. [sighs]

22:29.765 --> 22:31.933
-Okay, stop moving.
-It’s tight.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.353
-[both laughing]
-[entertainer] I know!

22:34.436 --> 22:38.148
Oh! I’ve never really known
if I was a soprano or an alto.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.901
Because I can sing really high,
but I've also got low notes.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.737
-Oh, I’m an alto when I rap, for sure.
-Maybe you’re a mezzo.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.489
-A mezzo. [laughs]
-Maybe.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.908
-[chuckles]
-[gasps] Aw!

22:48.116 --> 22:50.494
Oh, look at him. [chuckles]

22:50.577 --> 22:53.121
-Ah! Honey, wake up.
-[gasps]

22:53.872 --> 22:58.710
Sorry, babe. I just had meetings all day
with the acrobats, and jugglers,

22:58.794 --> 23:01.171
and a baby... tiger wrangler.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.340
I want you to meet Bobby Barnes.

23:03.673 --> 23:07.010
We all just went to his show downstairs,
and it was so incredible!

23:07.094 --> 23:08.303
-Ohhh!
-Oh!

23:08.553 --> 23:10.931
I'm gonna get the champagne.
He’s gonna teach me how to sing.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.557
[Bash] Oh.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.850
[chuckles]

23:13.934 --> 23:16.103
Are you sure I'm not interrupting?
Do you need to sleep?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.021
-No, no, no. Please, sit down.
-[Bobby] All right.

23:18.688 --> 23:20.357
They beat those tigers.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.275
-They do?
-Yeah.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.903
I’m not surprised
everyone’s trying to get an audience

23:24.986 --> 23:26.530
with the Howard Foods prince.

23:26.613 --> 23:29.116
-My son loves your baked beans.
-Hey!

23:29.199 --> 23:32.327
-Eats them right out of the can.
-I'll have them send over a case.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.912
Oh, thanks. [chuckles]

23:33.995 --> 23:36.832
-So, you’re a singer?
-Yeah. And I’ve got a good show,

23:36.915 --> 23:38.542
if I may say so myself.

23:38.625 --> 23:42.295
-I’ve been here ten years, eleven in June.
-Wow!

23:43.547 --> 23:45.882
I hope you don’t mind one last pitch
from a desperate performer.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.759
-Please. Any friend of Rhonda’s.
-All right.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.054
Downstairs, they’re turning people away,

23:51.680 --> 23:54.683
-and yet I can’t get a bigger room.
-Huh!

23:54.933 --> 23:57.060
And there's not a hotel
out that window that hasn’t,

23:57.144 --> 23:58.937
pardon my language, fucked me

23:59.020 --> 24:00.480
with a four-wall deal.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.983
I pay to play, and I'm cheap, Mr. Howard,

24:03.066 --> 24:06.361
but I have made money
for lots of loathsome people,

24:06.445 --> 24:09.489
who’d let me die on the street
if it weren’t for the butts in the seats,

24:09.573 --> 24:12.868
and now...
I’d like to make money for you.

24:12.951 --> 24:13.785
Oh!

24:13.869 --> 24:15.370
Yeah. You are, by all accounts,

24:15.454 --> 24:16.955
-non-loathsome.
-Thank you.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.833
You care about your performers,
and you pay them well.

24:19.916 --> 24:20.917
Word travels.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.796
-You really should come and see my show.
-Yeah, I definitely will.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.965
Well, come to the late show.
We’ll have a drink after.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.384
It might have to be the early show.
Tonight notwithstanding,

24:29.468 --> 24:31.428
my wife and I typically
like to go to bed early,

24:31.511 --> 24:32.345
-so...
-Yeah.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.556
So do my wife and I. [chuckles]

24:36.558 --> 24:37.434
Excuse me?

24:39.227 --> 24:41.229
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to...

24:42.731 --> 24:45.275
I do have a son. He’s seven.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.235
-Uh-huh.
-His mother was a very dear friend.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.529
I couldn’t resist putting
a little spread together.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.198
Wow, this is wonderful.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.741
-Isn’t she something?
-Yeah.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.867
-There you are.
-[laughs]

24:53.950 --> 24:55.494
-Thanks.
-Cheers.

After we lost the baby... [sighs]

25:19.100 --> 25:21.144
-...I was so scared.
-I know.

25:21.811 --> 25:25.023
But he... he said that it didn’t matter.
He said that...

25:25.106 --> 25:27.651
-that we... we were enough.
-Look,

25:27.984 --> 25:30.987
I love Randy, but sometimes, I...
Ugh. Oh, God.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.574
[whispering] Sometimes I think about
how much easier it would be...

25:34.658 --> 25:36.660
[tuts] You-- You don’t have to whisper.

-[Debbie screaming] If I never had a baby!

25:47.003 --> 25:51.049
And I'd never gotten married!

25:52.050 --> 25:53.301
A clean slate.

25:54.636 --> 25:56.346
I don’t want a clean slate.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.809
I want... I-- I want Keith.
I love being married to him.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.437
Well, sure, we all do.
But I had a baby to put something

26:04.521 --> 26:06.481
between my husband and the door,
and guess what?

26:06.565 --> 26:09.359
Husbands will... step over anything.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.404
You wanna go in the hot tub?

26:12.487 --> 26:13.822
-[Debbie] Yes, I do.
-Yay!

26:14.197 --> 26:15.407
-No, I don't.
-No.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.450
-I’m too high to leave the room.
-[sighs]

26:17.534 --> 26:19.744
-Plus, Cherry?
-Hm?

26:19.911 --> 26:22.414
-I can’t really go downstairs.
-Why?

26:22.497 --> 26:25.375
I fucked both valets,
the Flamingo entrance and the Paradise.

26:25.458 --> 26:27.127
And the night bartender

26:27.210 --> 26:29.462

whose table faces the elevator.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.424
Oh... my... God.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.801
I left a juggler in my room.

Wait, what...
Do-- Do you need to go get him?

26:43.310 --> 26:45.812
-No, no, no. He’ll leave when he’s hungry.
-Ah.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.648
-[laughs] Good point.
-[chuckles]

26:49.024 --> 26:50.483
Damn, that many?

Well, I don’t think you can return
something to a pawn shop.

[exhales, chuckles]
You’re not crazy. I was being a dick.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.140
It’s not your fault.

27:22.223 --> 27:25.393
It’s the distance, and then that puts
so much pressure on the visit.

27:25.977 --> 27:29.397
And...
this place <i>can </i>make you a little crazy.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.776

We can do one more month, right?

in voice lessons, though.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.454
You remember her?

31:14.747 --> 31:15.999
[choked up] That’d be wonderful.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.636
[sighs]

31:32.473 --> 31:35.226
[takes a deep breath]

31:37.520 --> 31:38.605
[Sheila] Baltimore.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.234
I’m from Baltimore.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.209
I loved your show.

32:05.006 --> 32:06.257
[sighs]

32:10.637 --> 32:13.181
How long has it been
since you washed that?

32:31.908 --> 32:33.076
[exhales deeply]

32:47.173 --> 32:49.175
[relaxing instrumental music playing]

33:00.979 --> 33:02.480
Where in Baltimore?
