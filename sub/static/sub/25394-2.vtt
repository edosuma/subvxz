Previously onSalvation...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.222
But like Darius said,
this bunker will protect us

00:05.266 --> 00:06.876
from any nuclear strike.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.617
And just how long are
we supposed to be down here?

00:08.660 --> 00:09.705
Could be 30 days.

00:09.748 --> 00:10.836
I didn't sign up for that.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.447
I'm going to see my family.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.104
HARRIS: Looks like
he fell from the gantry.

00:17.147 --> 00:19.280
Maybe Joe hadn't given up
on finding a way out.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.672
What if this wasn't an accident?

00:20.716 --> 00:23.240
:
Global citizens, we are RE/SYST.

00:23.284 --> 00:25.286
The United States and Russia
have initiated

00:25.329 --> 00:27.766
an armed nuclear conflict.

00:27.810 --> 00:32.771
We control one remaining ICBM
carrying 13 warheads.

00:32.815 --> 00:35.992
Madam President.We just received
the demands from RE/SYST.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.299
They're assembling their own
asteroid mitigation project

00:38.342 --> 00:41.084
with 30 scientists
from around the world.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.303
They've given a list of names.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.218
Liam Cole.Hello, Liam.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.915
Croft?
MACKENZIE:
They're asking for Tanz

00:45.958 --> 00:47.308
as their base of operation.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.570
Well, they've taken
away all my power.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.312
I'm essentially useless.Not to me.

00:51.355 --> 00:53.096
I, Darius Tanz,
do solemnly swear...

00:53.140 --> 00:55.229
You're vice president?

00:55.272 --> 00:57.579
I poured my heart out
on that hill.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.320
You're wondering why
I can't be emotional right now?

00:59.363 --> 01:03.150
I-I can't be anything
right now. To anyone.

01:03.193 --> 01:05.369
MACKENZIE: Monroe Bennett and his men have managed to escape.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.371
Now he and Claire Rayburn,
they're in the wind.

01:09.504 --> 01:10.809
We need to find them.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.159
Madam President...

01:12.202 --> 01:13.682
Yes, Madam President,
finding Monroe Bennett

01:13.725 --> 01:15.249
and Claire Rayburn will be

01:15.292 --> 01:16.554
my top priority.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.165
We have control
of three airbases

01:18.208 --> 01:20.210
and two aircraft carriers.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.256
What are your orders?We will take back
the White House.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.996
By any means necessary.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.433
Yes, Mr. President.

01:26.608 --> 01:29.350
Are you prepared for the worst?

01:29.393 --> 01:31.091
No problem.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.396
Because we are.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.398
Ride out the apocalypse in style

01:34.442 --> 01:37.009
in one of our luxury
survival condos.

01:37.053 --> 01:40.491
Nestled safely underground,
this 22-story,

01:40.535 --> 01:42.928
family-friendly complex
has all the conveniences

01:42.972 --> 01:44.887
of a five-star resort.

01:44.930 --> 01:48.586
And at a bargain of only
$5 million per family of four,

01:48.630 --> 01:50.327
what are you waiting for?

01:50.371 --> 01:51.720
The end of the world?

01:51.763 --> 01:55.115
By then, it'll be too late.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.421
The stock market
is in free fall.

01:57.465 --> 02:00.250
Many people have stopped
showing up for work.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.165
NEWSCASTER: Police report
a spike in looting.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.167
REPORTER: Believing Judgment Day
to be on the horizon,

Everything.

♪

03:15.586 --> 03:17.109
HARRIS:
That's everything

03:17.153 --> 03:18.937
the NSA has on Bennett's
possible whereabouts.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.852
The only way Bennett could have
escaped is with some help

03:20.896 --> 03:22.245
in high places.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.942
That's why I'm giving this
to you.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.641
I don't know
who I can trust right now.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.251
I need Monroe Bennett
brought in

03:28.295 --> 03:30.514
quickly, quietly.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.560
Dead or alive.

03:32.603 --> 03:35.606
Is this the president's edict
or yours?

03:35.650 --> 03:40.307
Bennett gave the order
that killed my son.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.612
You're a father.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.484
If someone was responsible
for Grace's death,

03:43.527 --> 03:45.486
what would you do to them?

03:45.529 --> 03:46.965
Nothing that can be repeated.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.751
But Bennett deserves far
worse than a quick death.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.188
He deserves to rot in prison,
not a hole in the ground.

03:56.584 --> 03:57.585
All right, bring him in.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
MAN:

It's good to be back
in this room.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.655
Yeah, you steal all
your best ideas here.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.354
I suppose I deserved that.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.746
You deserve far worse than that.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.444
What? Like a bullet
in the shoulder?

04:30.487 --> 04:32.402
I wish I'd put it
through your heart.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.274
Perhaps you'd like
to switch seats.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.277
So you can sit next
to your... friend?

04:42.064 --> 04:44.022
:
Good morning.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.763
Some of the greatest minds
in the world

04:45.807 --> 04:48.462
are assembled
in this room today.

04:48.505 --> 04:51.291
You are being asked to solve
the most critical problem

04:51.334 --> 04:54.642
facing humanity:
how to deflect the asteroid

04:54.685 --> 04:58.776
which is due to collide
with Earth in 121 days.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.648
The goal is to quickly settle

05:00.691 --> 05:05.740
on the plan which has the
highest probability of success.

05:05.783 --> 05:09.570
You will divide into preselected
groups based on expertise.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.964
Your group number
is on your name card.

05:13.008 --> 05:17.142
You will be well cared for,
provided you play by the rules.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.101
Anyone who attempts to contact

05:19.144 --> 05:22.496
the outside world
will face consequences.

05:22.539 --> 05:27.370
Anyone who doesn't report them
will face execution.

05:32.636 --> 05:34.682
We are RE/SYST.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.601
JILLIAN:
I've put together profiles

05:40.644 --> 05:43.125
on anyone in the Ark bunker
who wasn't properly vetted

05:43.168 --> 05:44.300
through the initial
screening process.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.475
Good. I'll need you
to go through them

05:45.519 --> 05:46.911
with a fine-tooth comb.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.697
Okay, and, uh,
what am I looking for?

05:49.740 --> 05:52.395
Other than a... a "saboteur."

05:52.439 --> 05:55.267
Inconsistencies, anything
that doesn't add up.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.792
Think of it as a
story you're writing.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.577
Make sure the narrative
doesn't have any holes.

06:00.621 --> 06:01.752
Okay.

06:01.796 --> 06:04.320
Wait, Darius, isn't
this your office?

06:04.364 --> 06:05.495
No, no, no, no.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.584
I-I asked them for
something more suitable.

06:07.628 --> 06:09.978
Like...?
The attic.

06:10.021 --> 06:12.328
Uh, the White House attic
is your office?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.939
I can't think outside the box
from inside a box.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.550
Oh, and Darius, about Joe Riggs,

06:16.593 --> 06:19.379
the, um, man who passed away
in the bunker.

06:19.422 --> 06:22.251
Yes. I'll pay the family
an official visit

06:22.294 --> 06:23.470
to offer my condolences.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.341
I should do that, shouldn't I?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.951
As soon as I get back.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.737
Wait, back from where?

06:38.310 --> 06:39.399
HARRIS:
You're insane.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.270
"You're insane,
Mr. Vice President."

06:41.313 --> 06:42.793
Show at least
some level of decorum,

06:42.837 --> 06:44.186
Mr. Secretary.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.580
Okay, Mr. Vice President,
we cannot

06:46.623 --> 06:48.973
authorize you traveling to New
Jersey, let alone Iceland.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.061
RE/SYST has threatened

06:50.105 --> 06:51.541
to drop nuclear weapons
on anyone

06:51.585 --> 06:53.456
who defies their travel ban.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.197
Which is why I'll need
a stealth jet to get me there.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.328
A B-2 bomber,
to be more precise.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.504
Fly under the radar, as it were.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.288
What's in Reykjavík?

06:59.331 --> 07:00.594
RISC.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.378
Reykjavík International
Science Coalition.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.207
RE/SYST has drafted
the world's best scientists.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.470
We'll need to do the same
in order to implement my plan

07:07.514 --> 07:09.211
to deflect
the asteroid.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.127
And what exactly is your plan,
Mr. Vice President?

07:12.170 --> 07:14.129
A rail gun.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.173
In layman's terms,

07:15.217 --> 07:17.480
a massive magnetic cannon

07:17.524 --> 07:20.004
that will fire a series
of hypersonic bullets

07:20.048 --> 07:22.093
at the asteroid,
knocking it off course.

07:22.137 --> 07:23.399
Simple idea,

07:23.443 --> 07:26.010
difficult execution, I'm afraid.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.447
Which is why I need
to get to Reykjavík.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.057
RISC presides over

07:29.100 --> 07:30.928
the world's largest
supercollider.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.626
A 17-mile pipe

07:32.669 --> 07:34.062
I'll repurpose into a rail gun.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.585
GRACE:
Darius--

07:35.629 --> 07:37.892
Mr. Vice President--
RISC is disbanding,

07:37.935 --> 07:39.502
as are most international forums
right now.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.070
Disbanding in 24 hours.

07:42.113 --> 07:44.159
They haven't yet.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.248
There isn't much time,
so I'd appreciate

07:46.291 --> 07:48.250
a signoff on a requisition form

07:48.293 --> 07:49.947
or however it is
one gets permission

07:49.991 --> 07:51.079
to borrow a stealth jet
these days.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.646
I'm sorry, I'm new at this.

07:52.689 --> 07:55.083
Madam President,
I promise you,

07:55.126 --> 07:57.172
the rail gun will work.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.131

08:00.175 --> 08:01.568
I want you to accompany

08:01.611 --> 08:03.047
the vice president.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.527
Use that same
diplomatic flair

08:04.571 --> 08:06.573
you two
so expertly displayed

08:06.616 --> 08:07.748
with our Russian friends.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.271
Will do.

08:09.314 --> 08:10.925
You're only gonna have one shot
at this.

08:10.968 --> 08:14.232
You have 24 hours to get in,
get it done, and get home.

08:14.276 --> 08:16.974
If you're caught crossing
international borders,

08:17.018 --> 08:19.281
it will trigger a nuclear
response from RE/SYST.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.808
Well, then, we'd better
not get caught.

Grace. Grace, it's PTSD.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.364
Now, you've been
through a trauma.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.279
Nightmares, flashbacks,
it's all normal.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.586
Yeah, well, this "normal"
is making me insane.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.632
The guilt of carrying
this secret...
Hey.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.112
We're in this together.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.201
I'm the one who
pulled the trigger.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.203
To save my life.

09:55.246 --> 09:56.857
And I'll never forget that.

Mm-hmm.
Wait, wait,
you have a working EmDrive?

to a gravity tractor,

11:18.286 --> 11:20.984
which should be reaching
the asteroid in a few weeks.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.073
And once there, it's supposed
to slowly pull the asteroid

11:23.117 --> 11:26.294
off its collision course
with Earth, but apparently

11:26.337 --> 11:28.949
something didn't add up,
or we wouldn't be here.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.037
So, Mr. Cole...

11:31.081 --> 11:33.388
...you have any idea
what went wrong?

11:33.431 --> 11:34.694
Hmm?

11:36.260 --> 11:37.958
DARIUS:
The asteroid's iron core.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.133
We didn't account
for its density.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.177
The-the gravity
tractor's mass

11:40.221 --> 11:41.396
may not be great enough

11:41.439 --> 11:42.876
to move Samson
off its course.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.486
No.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.575
Nothing?

11:46.618 --> 11:48.620
No idea.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.622
Hmm.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.059
Well...

12:00.328 --> 12:04.767
There are 30 different countries
represented at RISC.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.943
You'll need
a two-thirds majority.

12:06.987 --> 12:09.598
Most influential members tend
to be the European Bloc.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.295
They vote on a united front.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.775
GRACE: Yes, but relations
are frosty right now

12:12.819 --> 12:14.298
between the East
and the West,

12:14.342 --> 12:16.605
so you're gonna have to forge,
um, a détente of sorts.

12:16.648 --> 12:18.172
They were frosty before
they knew the world

12:18.215 --> 12:20.565
was about to be incinerated
by a space rock.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.307
Perhaps now they're in a
more of a hugging mood.

12:23.351 --> 12:26.136
Hmm. Wasn't it
Winston Churchill who said,

12:26.180 --> 12:28.704
"Never let a good crisis
go to waste"?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.271
He had World War II.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.186
You have an asteroid
and a nuclear bomb.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.666
Use them wisely.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.238
So you and Harris
seem cozy.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.330
Really?

12:46.374 --> 12:47.723
That's what you want
to talk about?

12:47.767 --> 12:48.811
Well, it's just
an observation.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.117
We don't have to
talk about it.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.162
Good, 'cause
we're not going to.

12:55.209 --> 12:59.430
Fellas, would you mind
just giving us a second?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.349
Grace, is there something
I need to know?

13:05.393 --> 13:06.437
Because if there is...

13:06.481 --> 13:08.439
No, Mr. Vice President.Oh, stop.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.093
You wanted things
to be professional.

13:10.137 --> 13:13.270
I want things to be
normal between us.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.274
You say you're not
a politician.

13:17.318 --> 13:20.016
You certainly
flip-flop like one.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.279
You can't have it
both ways.

13:24.542 --> 13:28.024
This is
the new normal, Darius.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.592
Get used to it.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.033
HUGH:
Fort Lesley J. McNair,

13:37.077 --> 13:39.470
Washington Navy Yard,
National Guard Armory,

13:39.514 --> 13:41.081
all reported missing munitions,

13:41.124 --> 13:42.778
vehicles, even tanks.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.258
Bennett's amassing an army.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.173
Only two reasons
to do that.
Yeah.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.914
To defend or to attack.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.306
He's got to be working

13:49.350 --> 13:50.699
out of a shuttered
military base,

13:50.742 --> 13:53.528
somewhere within 20 miles
of here.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.705
I had three generals fail
to report for duty today.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.272
All three were stationed

13:58.315 --> 14:01.362
at Fort Reynolds at some
point in the last five years

14:01.405 --> 14:02.363
before the base was closed.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.755
Do you believe
in coincidences?

14:03.799 --> 14:05.540
Not since the night I
realized my father and Santa

14:05.583 --> 14:07.368
were never in the same
room at the same time.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.543
Makes perfect sense.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.414
Go to ground you know,
where you feel safe.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.894
They would know every inch
of that base.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.983
I'll assemble my team.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.072
We'll move tonight.
We'll need backup.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.465
You'll have it.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.553
See you there,
Mr. Secretary?

14:18.596 --> 14:20.033
I wouldn't miss it.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.383
Sir, that detective
from D.C. Law Enforcement

14:22.426 --> 14:23.819
called again.
Third time.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.038
Did he say what it was about?

14:25.081 --> 14:26.474
Claire Rayburn.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.085
Okay. Thank you, Lois.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.400
So, are you on some kind
of suicide mission

14:39.443 --> 14:41.271
or just an idiot?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.664
What are you
talking about?

14:42.707 --> 14:45.362
The world's greatest scientists
are assembled here

14:45.406 --> 14:47.625
to save the world, and you
and your professor friend

14:47.669 --> 14:49.410
are bickering
like two little boys.

14:49.453 --> 14:51.716
Former friend. That little
troll was selling secrets

14:51.760 --> 14:53.893
to the Russians.Oh, who cares, Liam?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.111
You need to move on
from the past.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.418
Get on board to protect
our future.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.246
Get on board with RE/SYST?

14:59.289 --> 15:00.508
They're criminals.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.075
They dropped a
nuke on Kansas.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.729
No. They moved a nuke
to Kansas.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.558
Have you ever thought about what
Russia's original target was?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.780
RE/SYST stopped
the United States

15:11.823 --> 15:14.304
and Russia from destroying
each other.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.003
The arrogance of your countries,
it's obscene.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.570
Well, you, okay, you seem to be
a huge fan of RE/SYST.

15:19.614 --> 15:20.963
I'm not big on being
held hostage.

15:21.007 --> 15:23.531
You think I want to be here?

15:23.574 --> 15:26.360
Look, maybe you have nothing
to live for,

15:26.403 --> 15:28.101
but I do.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.453
RE/SYST is not the problem.
You are.

15:41.592 --> 15:45.422
You said you were calling from
the Office of Strategic Plans?

15:45.466 --> 15:47.555
:
Is that even a thing?

15:47.598 --> 15:50.166
Oh, yeah, no, uh,
of course it is.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.038
Uh, yeah, sorry.

15:52.081 --> 15:53.865
The vice president
is currently unavailable.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.737
Will return.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.782
Thank you.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.437
Sorry.

16:00.481 --> 16:01.873
I just need you to sign
for this.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.622
Jillian?

16:11.666 --> 16:13.624
Yeah?

16:13.668 --> 16:15.235
It's me, Nate Ryland.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.497
Thomas Jefferson
High School.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.281
Sophomore year?

16:18.325 --> 16:20.066
Mrs. Lattimore's English class?
Nate?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.763
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.852
Sorry, I didn't recognize you.

16:23.895 --> 16:25.985
Uh, without the
braces and the acne?

16:26.028 --> 16:27.508
Yeah, I hope not.

16:27.551 --> 16:31.077
So, office of the VP,
impressive.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.644
How are you holding up

16:33.688 --> 16:35.298
with all the crazy
going on out there?

16:35.342 --> 16:39.172
About the same as everyone,
I suspect.

16:39.215 --> 16:40.956
Uh, so you work
at the White House?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.699
Uh, DoD, actually. I'm a liaison
to the White House.

16:44.742 --> 16:47.484
I deliver classified documents.

16:48.659 --> 16:49.921
Oh, you mean
like this box?

16:49.965 --> 16:52.707
The one that I now
have access to.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.275
FBI, NSA, Homeland--
all the names you requested.

16:56.493 --> 16:57.712
You're busy.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.409
I'm gonna take off, but, uh,

16:59.453 --> 17:01.324
we should catch up,
grab a drink sometime.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.414
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, yes. Um...

17:04.458 --> 17:06.416
Vice President Tanz's office.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.810
NEWSCASTER :
This is a special report.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.507
Streets are deserted,

17:10.551 --> 17:12.466
as most citizens hunker down
with their families,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.642
unsure of what the future holds.

17:14.685 --> 17:16.470
Whiplashing between
multiple crises,

17:16.513 --> 17:18.385
Americans don't know
which way to look.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.474
Meanwhile, Vice President Tanz's
approval ratings

17:20.517 --> 17:22.650
are at a record high.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.234
Listen, Officer,
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.714
My name is Harris...Harris Edwards.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.107
You're a hard
man to reach.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.196
Detective Alonzo Carter.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.503
D.C. Police.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.940
Investigating the disappearance
of Claire Rayburn.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.246
Mm-hmm.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.987
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

18:05.736 --> 18:08.783
DARIUS:
Good day. We're here to see
the director general.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.567
My name is
Darius Tanz.

18:10.611 --> 18:11.568
Is she expecting you, sir?

18:11.612 --> 18:12.743
No, but she'll...

18:12.787 --> 18:14.310
He's here on official business

18:14.354 --> 18:15.572
as vice president
of the United States government.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.618
There wasn't time
to make an appointment.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.142
Grace Barrows, senior advisor
to the president

18:20.186 --> 18:21.535
of the United States.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.233
One moment, Ms. Barrows.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.670
Thank you.

18:30.413 --> 18:32.328
Way to throw
our weight around.

18:32.372 --> 18:34.591
If you got it, flaunt it.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.551
Okay, clock's ticking.
What's our first move?

18:37.594 --> 18:40.467
Get Rosetta to convene one last
meeting with the council,

18:40.510 --> 18:41.816
so I can address them directly.

18:41.859 --> 18:42.991
Rosetta?

18:43.034 --> 18:45.646
We're old friends.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.214
Gun!

18:56.657 --> 18:59.486
This is obviously
a mix-up.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.575
We're representatives
of the United States government

19:01.618 --> 19:03.490
here to speak with Dr. Stendahl.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.666
I'm afraid I can't do that,
Darius.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.581
I don't know how you got
into the country,

19:07.624 --> 19:08.973
but if you don't leave
immediately,

19:09.017 --> 19:11.628
security will be forced
to shoot.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.078
Drop your weapons.
This is madness.

19:27.122 --> 19:32.432
Darius, do not make this
any harder than it needs to be.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.216
Rosetta, I have a plan
to save us all.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.827
Shoot me and you'll be killing
seven billion people

19:36.871 --> 19:38.699
with that bullet.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.277
It's good to see you, too.

19:52.930 --> 19:53.975
Detective, I'm guessing

19:54.018 --> 19:56.107
this isn't exactly
department protocol.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.936
Well, protocol has kind of gone

19:58.980 --> 20:01.417
out the window these days,
Mr. Secretary,

20:01.461 --> 20:03.463
with the world
being what it is.

20:03.506 --> 20:06.988
But, uh, I won't take up
too much of your time.

20:07.031 --> 20:10.948
I haven't seen Claire since the
nuclear threat was announced.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.560
She took off, along
with Monroe Bennett.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.736
I assume wherever he is, she is.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.608
What was your relationship
with her?

20:19.783 --> 20:23.483
We worked together, as you know.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.659
Seems like you were more
than just work friends.

20:25.702 --> 20:26.834
Unless...

20:28.879 --> 20:30.968
...this was just casual Friday.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.801
We were involved
three years ago.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.196
I was married. She was divorced.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.416
I broke it off.
We remain cordial.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.505
:
"Cordial."

20:45.548 --> 20:47.115
I like that word.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.291
Her place was scrubbed clean.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.293
No prints.

20:51.337 --> 20:53.861
Not even her own.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.689
It's unusual, don't you think?

20:55.732 --> 20:58.257
Look, Detective, I know you're
just trying to do your job,

20:58.300 --> 20:59.606
and I wish I had
more information.

20:59.649 --> 21:00.998
But right now

21:01.042 --> 21:02.870
I've got the security
of the country on my back,

21:02.913 --> 21:05.786
and this is not my priority.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.744
Now, if you don't exit
the car immediately,

21:07.788 --> 21:08.832
we're gonna have a problem.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.142
Okay.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.884
Thanks for your cooperation,

21:16.927 --> 21:18.929
Mr. Secretary.

21:37.557 --> 21:39.036
I see you follow instruction

21:39.080 --> 21:41.256
about as well now
as you did at MIT.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.780
What were you thinking,
violating the travel ban?

21:43.824 --> 21:45.129
Rosetta and I
were classmates--

21:45.173 --> 21:48.350
and friends, so I thought.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.830
You put us all in grave danger.You're right.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.353
We are in danger,
which is why I need

21:51.397 --> 21:52.963
to speak to the council
immediately.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.792
You're too late. RE/SYST has
ordered the council to disband.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.404
We're shutting down.Not for 12 hours.

21:58.447 --> 22:00.275
There's nothing
I can do, Darius.Yes, there is.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.798
You hold the power
to call a vote.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.757
You can keep RISC operational.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.455
If we defy them,
they have threatened

22:06.499 --> 22:08.065
to drop their bombs
on London, Berlin,

22:08.109 --> 22:09.415
Vienna...And that scares you more

22:09.458 --> 22:11.242
than complete annihilation
of the planet?

22:11.286 --> 22:13.244
Let's just say
they're both equally terrifying

22:13.288 --> 22:15.116
and call it a draw.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.466
People have lost their minds
here. The past few weeks

22:17.510 --> 22:20.643
have been...Unlike anything
the world has ever seen.

22:20.687 --> 22:24.299
Dr. Stendahl, RE/SYST doesn't
want to drop those nukes,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.301
but they do want to scare us
into believing they will,

22:26.345 --> 22:27.694
to control us

22:27.737 --> 22:29.696
through fear. We
can't kowtow to them.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.306
And we can't rely on them
to solve the problem.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.656
They are the enemy.
We are the resistance.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.963
It's up to us to
save our future.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.749
Remember what we used to say?

22:40.881 --> 22:43.318
"Ex nihilo nihil fit"?

22:43.362 --> 22:46.016
Nothing comes from nothing.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.034
HARRIS: Who else knew
about the console's ability

23:04.078 --> 23:06.341
to connect to the outside?

23:09.431 --> 23:12.434
CROFT:
It doesn't work.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.088
You don't think I tried?

23:14.131 --> 23:16.395
RE/SYST has plugged every hole
in the Tanz network,

23:16.438 --> 23:17.961
including the one in this game.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.834
You're not gonna communicate
with the outside world this way.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.618
So, what,
are you gonna turn me in?

23:22.662 --> 23:24.403
Oh, no, no.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.056
Then, what do you want, Croft?

23:26.100 --> 23:28.929
:
I come in peace.

23:29.712 --> 23:31.279
Come on.

23:32.715 --> 23:34.021
Thank you, Mr. Ortiz.

23:34.064 --> 23:35.588
Yeah, the vice president
just wanted

23:35.631 --> 23:37.459
to make sure we had
all your correct information.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.428
What's your name?Joe Riggs.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.474
HARRIS:
Maybe Joe hadn't given up

23:52.518 --> 23:54.128
on finding a way out.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.912
Or maybe he just gave up.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.317
OPERATOR: We're sorry.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.493
You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

24:11.537 --> 24:13.930
or is no longer in service.

24:27.422 --> 24:29.380
Hi. This is Jillian Hayes

24:29.424 --> 24:31.600
from the vice president's
office.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.820
I'd like to request a car.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.169
Russian, no doubt.

24:35.212 --> 24:37.171
Oh, yeah, that's funny.
That's really funny.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.956
Mm-hmm. I don't remember
you being such a jerk.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.002
I studied under the best.Yeah.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.967
Listen, we don't
have time to chat.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.448
What went wrong
with the gravity tractor?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.885
By all accounts
it should have worked.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.235
Look, Liam, don't be a fool.

24:58.279 --> 25:00.455
If you know something,
you need to share it.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.848
No. No, I don't.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.240
I don't have to do anything,
Croft.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.547
I don't trust them,
and I definitely

25:05.591 --> 25:07.375
don't trust you.Look, I'm sorry.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.550
I really am.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.726
But what happened

25:10.770 --> 25:12.293
is less important
than what is happening.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.556
We've got some of the greatest
minds in the world gathered.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.863
We've got 14 Nobel Prizes
in that room.

25:16.906 --> 25:18.952
Our best hope for saving
the planet is right here.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.475
But if you know something

25:20.519 --> 25:21.998
and you're holding back,

25:22.042 --> 25:22.912
you're, you're not hurting me.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.523
You're not hurting
RE/SYST.

25:24.566 --> 25:25.959
You're destroying
the planet.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.177
You think about that.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.575
Look, I know you
gotta be you,

25:33.619 --> 25:35.534
and that works
most of the time,

25:35.577 --> 25:36.883
but you never tried
to get consensus

25:36.926 --> 25:38.319
from 30 countries at once,

25:38.362 --> 25:39.929
none of whom have a
favorable impression

25:39.973 --> 25:41.540
of the U.S. right now.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.846
Meaning?

25:43.890 --> 25:46.501
Meaning you're not just
here as a scientist

25:46.545 --> 25:47.894
but as a diplomat.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.374
Remember, détente.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.594
You have to play nice if you
want them to share their toys.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.509
I was never good
at playing nice.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.903
Why doesn't that
surprise me?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.905
DARIUS:
Thank you, council members,

25:58.948 --> 26:01.385
for gathering
on such short notice.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.562
I appreciate your forbearance.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.086
You are risking
devastating consequences

26:06.129 --> 26:09.524
simply by listening to me today.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.527
The fact that you are
here is already a victory

26:12.571 --> 26:15.095
of hope over fear.

26:15.138 --> 26:18.489
Now, I have a plan to stop
the asteroid that will work,

26:18.533 --> 26:21.492
but I need your cooperation
to make it happen.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.494
The plan:

26:23.538 --> 26:26.628
we repurpose the supercollider
here at RISC,

26:26.672 --> 26:28.456
turning it into a rail gun.

26:28.499 --> 26:32.460
Using material technology
developed by Dr. Raul Aguirre,

26:32.503 --> 26:35.506
we shoot thousands
of iron sabot shells

26:35.550 --> 26:38.248
encased in dense,
depleted uranium

26:38.292 --> 26:41.425
capable of knocking
the asteroid off course.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.340
Instead of hyperaccelerating

26:43.384 --> 26:45.647
subatomic particles,

26:45.691 --> 26:49.346
we will use magnets
to launch our projectiles.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.653
Why should we trust
the United States?

26:51.697 --> 26:54.656
You incited a nuclear
conflict and allowed RE/SYST

26:54.700 --> 26:56.353
to take the world hostage.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.529
Your plan puts all
of our countries in jeopardy.

26:58.573 --> 27:01.010
If-if RE/SYST was to find out
any of us cooperated,

27:01.054 --> 27:02.359
they'd drop warheads,

27:02.403 --> 27:03.491
kill millions of people.

27:03.534 --> 27:04.666
WOMAN:
America is a pariah,

27:04.710 --> 27:05.754
Mr. Tanz.

27:05.798 --> 27:07.234
There is no goodwill left here.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.714
MAN: We are not
going to risk the lives

27:08.757 --> 27:11.630
of our citizens for a plan
that may or may not work.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.153
This meeting is over.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.676
Oh, so you cowards

27:14.720 --> 27:16.373
are just prepared to die,

27:16.417 --> 27:17.592
is that it?

27:17.636 --> 27:18.811
We are going to have
to trust RE/SYST.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.160
Your plan
will get us all killed!

27:20.203 --> 27:21.422
RE/SYST?

27:21.465 --> 27:24.381
Y-You're entrusting
the fate of the planet

27:24.425 --> 27:25.992
to an extremist group?

27:26.035 --> 27:27.471
A group that incited

27:27.515 --> 27:29.952
a nuclear war
between nations,

27:29.996 --> 27:31.693
all so they could look
like heroes.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.000
Make no mistake.
This is terrorism,

27:34.043 --> 27:36.567
pure and simple,
and it will not stand.

27:38.308 --> 27:39.919
No.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.095
These are not the people

27:42.138 --> 27:44.750
that we should entrust
with the fate of the world.

27:44.793 --> 27:45.925
Weare.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.757
Are there risks? Of course.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.062
Only a fool would deny it.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.108
But the--
but the greatest risk right now

27:55.151 --> 27:56.370
is that asteroid

27:56.413 --> 27:58.502
hurtling toward us.

27:58.546 --> 28:02.681
And the only way to stop it
is science.

28:06.641 --> 28:08.861
If-if you'll
just hear me out.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.473
Please.

28:12.516 --> 28:14.170
Throughout time,

28:14.214 --> 28:16.477
thinkers like Galileo and Turing

28:16.520 --> 28:18.261
have led the way,
braving ridicule

28:18.305 --> 28:20.263
and even death

28:20.307 --> 28:22.918
to-to-to push mankind

28:22.962 --> 28:24.746
up the hill of history.

28:24.790 --> 28:28.228
This is our time to stand tall,
our time to lead.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.623
I ask you this:

28:32.667 --> 28:35.844
if not us, then who?

28:51.207 --> 28:52.948
Darius Tanz!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.878
Move!
MAN:
Keep his hands
behind his back.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.320
Darius?

29:17.364 --> 29:20.367
Move. Move. Move.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.937
Darius.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.113
No.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.593
:
No.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.903
Are you okay?

29:34.947 --> 29:36.644
Thanks to a fantastic tailor
in, in Bogotá.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.385
A bulletproof shirt?

29:38.428 --> 29:40.082
Graphene fiber...

29:40.126 --> 29:41.910
antiballistic fabric.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.347
Very expensive, but...

29:44.391 --> 29:45.958
light as a feather.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.571
It's okay.

29:50.614 --> 29:51.920
I'm okay. I'm okay.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.968
Get him out of here.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.665
You'll kill us all, Darius Tanz.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.536
We should trust RE/SYST.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.190
They will save us.

30:01.234 --> 30:03.018
They will save us!

30:03.062 --> 30:04.933
Sir, we need to get
you to the plane. Now.

30:04.977 --> 30:07.762
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.112
First rule of diplomacy:

30:10.156 --> 30:12.027
never let a good
crisis go to waste.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.422
Help me up.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.127
Now, where was I

30:25.171 --> 30:28.870
before I was
so rudely interrupted?

30:37.705 --> 30:39.663
Mrs. Riggs?
Yes.

30:39.707 --> 30:42.449
My name is Jillian Hayes.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

30:42.492 --> 30:44.190
Um, I'm here
on official business

30:44.233 --> 30:47.236
from the office
of the vice president.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.804
I'm sorry about the loss
of your husband.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.025
My husband?
Yes.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.984
Has no one contacted you?

30:56.028 --> 30:57.986
MAN:
Honey?

30:58.030 --> 30:59.727
What's going on?

30:59.770 --> 31:02.817
Joe, this lady from the
vice president's office seems

31:02.861 --> 31:05.037
to think you're dead.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.561
MAN:
Well, obviously I'm not.

31:07.604 --> 31:11.565
Uh... thank you very much
for your time.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.349
CROFT:
Enveloping the asteroid

31:13.393 --> 31:15.917
in a carbon fiber mesh
could alter

31:15.961 --> 31:18.267
its flight path.

31:18.311 --> 31:20.966
It's a glorified trawling net.

31:21.009 --> 31:22.228
And it's unsustainable, Croft,

31:22.271 --> 31:23.925
not when you consider
the time factor.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.493
I ran the numbers.
At ten million Newtons

31:26.536 --> 31:27.842
per square centimeter...Stop.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.539
He speaks.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.280
We thought maybe
someone cut out your tongue.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.891
It's not gonna work.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.371
Neither will the rocket thruster
or the drill bomb.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.938
It's not gonna work.

31:36.982 --> 31:37.939
None of these ideas

31:37.983 --> 31:39.985
are gonna work.

31:41.682 --> 31:42.813
:
All right, well...

31:42.857 --> 31:44.119
Show me this again.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.643
Liam. Liam!

31:48.167 --> 31:51.126
Okay, clearly, you have
information you're withholding.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.693
What aren't you telling us?

31:52.736 --> 31:55.087
We don't have time
for your games, Mr. Cole.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.916
My games? What about your games,
Ms. Vrettou?

31:57.959 --> 32:00.570
What?Earlier, you went straight
to those tea bags.

32:00.614 --> 32:01.963
You knew exactly
where everything was.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.096
It's a break room,
not the labyrinth of Knossos.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.358
It doesn't take a genius

32:05.401 --> 32:07.055
to find some tea bags.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.665
Actually, it does. I couldn't
find them for, like, a week.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.624
I don't have to answer to you.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.365
Well, you do
if you want answers fromme.

32:12.408 --> 32:15.237
If you want to know my
secrets, I need to know yours.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.806
Fine. Okay, have it your way.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.503
Wait.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.986
You're right.

32:25.030 --> 32:28.033
I have been
here before.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.340
I used to work for Darius.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.132
HARRIS:
How long before we move?

32:40.175 --> 32:41.611
Any moment now.

32:44.484 --> 32:47.008
I had a visit
from a D.C. Metro detective

32:47.052 --> 32:48.879
looking into Claire Rayburn's
disappearance.

32:48.923 --> 32:49.968
This gonna be a problem?

32:50.011 --> 32:52.013
Not for us. My team
took care of it.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.580
Yeah, a little too well.

32:53.623 --> 32:55.799
There were no prints
at her house, not even hers.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.584
Better that
than yours.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.760
There's no way to tie Grace,
you or me to that body,

32:59.803 --> 33:01.022
wherever it may be.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.763
You don't know?

33:02.806 --> 33:04.634
In my line of work,

33:04.678 --> 33:06.723
you don't ask a question if
you don't want the answer.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.030
MAN:
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird Leader.

33:09.074 --> 33:11.250
Ready to move on your command.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.165
Showtime.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.603
MAN:
Move out.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.612
Let's go.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.759
Over here.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.457
Sir, we have a problem.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.893
You're gonna want to see this.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.161
You all right?

33:53.205 --> 33:54.945
We got the two-thirds vote
we needed.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.905
It was a nasty scrum,
but we won the day.

33:57.948 --> 34:01.604
Congratulations on your first
victory as vice president.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.606
Ourvictory, Grace.

34:03.650 --> 34:06.218
I could never have gotten
this far without your diplomacy.

34:06.261 --> 34:08.785
Convincing Rosetta
was just as important

34:08.829 --> 34:10.483
as convincing
the rest of them.

34:10.526 --> 34:14.748
It seems we were able to
achieve détente after all.

34:14.791 --> 34:17.185
I hope so.

34:17.229 --> 34:19.840
Darius, wait.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.059
There's a problem.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.240
It's just over here, sir.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.639
We're too late.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.772
He's gonna go public.

34:38.815 --> 34:43.037
Question is...
what's he gonna say?

34:43.081 --> 34:45.039
The Mackenzie regime
has committed treason

34:45.083 --> 34:47.520
and lied to the American people.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.218
They are criminals
who must be stopped.

34:50.262 --> 34:54.657
I am still the president
of the United States of America,

34:54.701 --> 34:58.705
and I amgoing
to take back the White House.

35:06.582 --> 35:09.542
So, why all the secrecy?

35:09.585 --> 35:12.110
Thousands of people
have worked for Darius.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.113
It didn't end well.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.897
What

35:16.940 --> 35:18.507
Fired me?

35:19.856 --> 35:22.381
He ruined me.

35:22.424 --> 35:25.645
For seven years we worked
together side-by-side

35:25.688 --> 35:29.039
until I outpaced the "master"
and developed some technology

35:29.083 --> 35:30.737
that could change the world.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.695
And he kept her
all for himself.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.697
Her?

35:34.741 --> 35:36.699
Tess.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.180
Tess

35:39.224 --> 35:41.922
You developed the software
for one of the most

35:41.965 --> 35:44.664
advanced learning
computers in the world?

35:44.707 --> 35:47.623
He promised he would share
the knowledge with the world,

35:47.667 --> 35:49.930
that it wouldn't just be
a money-making enterprise.

35:49.973 --> 35:53.063
But at the end of the day, his
narcissism wouldn't allow that.

35:53.107 --> 35:56.632
And when I challenged him
to do the right thing?

35:56.676 --> 35:58.417
Well, let's just say
he didn't like that very much.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.159
And it's pretty difficult
to get a job in the tech world

36:01.202 --> 36:03.770
after Darius Tanz
blackballs you.

36:03.813 --> 36:07.426
That doesn't sound
like the Darius I know.

36:07.469 --> 36:09.950
Yeah, well...

36:09.993 --> 36:12.518
give it time.

36:14.476 --> 36:17.175
But this isn't about Darius.

36:17.218 --> 36:21.788
There are people out there
that I love, that I want to live

36:21.831 --> 36:23.833
to get to see again.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.880
The sooner we solve this,

36:26.923 --> 36:29.622
the sooner the world
goes back to normal.

36:42.678 --> 36:45.768
If we could focus
solar radiation on one point

36:45.812 --> 36:50.686
long enough, we may be able to
super-heat the asteroid surface,

36:50.730 --> 36:53.863
vaporizing it,
causing the rocket effect.

36:53.907 --> 36:56.126
Excuse me, Croft.

36:56.170 --> 36:58.259
What are you doing?
What are you...?

36:58.303 --> 36:59.129
Would you stop that?!

36:59.173 --> 37:00.261
Stop. You're erasing

37:00.305 --> 37:01.610
hours of work!

37:01.654 --> 37:03.221
None of your ideas will work

37:03.264 --> 37:04.918
because the asteroid has
an iron core.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.615
MAN:
Iron core?
MAN 2:
Iron core?

37:06.659 --> 37:08.704
CROFT:
No, no. We have data,
we have images.

37:08.748 --> 37:11.664
It's a rubble pile held together
by its own gravity.Yes, on the outside,

37:11.707 --> 37:13.840
but underneath, it is iron,
much too dense

37:13.883 --> 37:16.364
for any of these
current calculations.
What?

37:16.408 --> 37:18.497
You've been holding this back
the whole time?
And I'm sorry.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.760
But we got to save the world,
and I know what to do.

37:20.803 --> 37:24.416
All right. Here.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.213
DARIUS:
There must be something we can

37:39.257 --> 37:40.780
say or do to change their minds.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.303
STENDAHL:
You have to understand.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.870
Making a deal

37:43.913 --> 37:45.480
with the Mackenzie
administration was risky

37:45.524 --> 37:47.656
enough for us,
but now...

37:47.700 --> 37:50.659
No one feels they can trust
a United States in chaos.

37:50.703 --> 37:51.921
Believe me,

37:51.965 --> 37:53.488
I'm as disappointed as you are.

37:53.532 --> 37:54.837
We've run out of options.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.839
Sir?

37:56.883 --> 37:59.929
What if we haven't...
run out of options?

37:59.973 --> 38:02.932
What if I could get access
to the Maxwell Collider?

38:02.976 --> 38:05.021
GRACE:
Wait. You mean

38:05.065 --> 38:07.676
that particle accelerator
in Virginia? It's half built,

38:07.720 --> 38:09.069
abandoned.

38:09.112 --> 38:11.245
It's half built if we need
a particle accelerator.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.378
As far as planetary-scale
rail guns go,

38:13.421 --> 38:14.683
we could convert it.

38:14.727 --> 38:17.512
We?No one knows

38:17.556 --> 38:20.123
the complexities of magnetic
systems better than you do.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.734
It's not optimal.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.779
We'd need a team, of
course, but it's something.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.781
A place to start.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.088
But I can't do it without you.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.874
And you're telling me
this will work?

38:31.918 --> 38:35.530
It can
if we get it done in time.

38:35.574 --> 38:37.184
It-It's not gonna be easy.

38:39.012 --> 38:42.755
But nothing comes from nothing.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.132
CROWD :
Take her down! Take her down!

39:12.175 --> 39:15.265
Take her down!
Take her down!

39:15.309 --> 39:18.747
Take her down! Take her down!

39:18.791 --> 39:22.098
Take her down!
Take her down!

39:22.142 --> 39:23.796
Take her down!

39:27.887 --> 39:31.760
Hmm. Hello?

39:31.804 --> 39:33.283
Jillian.
Grace.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.547
Uh, there's someone
here to see you.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.592
:
A detective.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.638
:
What?

39:47.167 --> 39:49.125
Can I help you?

39:49.169 --> 39:51.911
I hope so.

39:54.043 --> 39:58.439
Detective Alonzo
Carter, D.C. Police.

39:58.483 --> 40:03.009
I'm investigating the
disappearance of Claire Rayburn.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.796
Doesn't D.C. Police have more
pressing matters right now

40:07.840 --> 40:09.929
than Ms. Rayburn's whereabouts?

40:09.972 --> 40:14.063
Mm, probably, but I don't.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.066
Claire is my sister.

40:18.198 --> 40:20.156
Honey,

40:20.200 --> 40:22.071
I'm right here.

40:25.074 --> 40:28.730
CROWD :
Take her down! Take her down!

40:28.774 --> 40:31.298
And I thought
Iceland was tense.

40:32.386 --> 40:34.214
Bennett's played this perfectly.

40:34.257 --> 40:39.437
By going public the way he did,
he's inoculated himself.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.743
We've lost our chance
to handle this discreetly.

40:41.787 --> 40:44.354
I'll say. He's got an army
waiting in the wings.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.661
All we can do now is prepare.

40:46.705 --> 40:49.098
Prepare for what?

40:50.317 --> 40:51.318
War.
