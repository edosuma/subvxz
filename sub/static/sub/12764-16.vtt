<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.844 --> 00:05.336
- Kyle?
- Be careful, even in our backyard.

00:05.381 --> 00:09.147
We have bigger problems.
Jessi starts back at school today.

00:09.185 --> 00:10.517
I sort of levitated.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.215
- Show me how.
- I will.

00:12.255 --> 00:15.747
- She's the one who attacked me.
- I know Lori will never forgive me.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.124
Earn forgiveness.

00:17.228 --> 00:19.560
<i>- She Could Be You.
- What?</i>

00:19.597 --> 00:22.294
The two of you used to play
that song all the time.

00:22.334 --> 00:24.461
D4.

00:24.503 --> 00:25.902
It's not there.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.669
It's a Latnok ring.
All the members received rings.

00:28.708 --> 00:30.369
A way of identifying one another.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.171
- Then you're Latnok?
- Yes.

00:32.212 --> 00:34.704
I got accepted into
a music program in New York.

00:34.748 --> 00:36.841
- I leave in two days.
- Two days?

00:36.884 --> 00:38.351
I miss this.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.983
I miss you.

00:41.022 --> 00:44.321
I didn't want to go back
to how I was before.

00:44.359 --> 00:46.088
How were you before?

00:46.127 --> 00:48.028
Invisible.

00:48.097 --> 00:51.965
I'll call and text and e-mail.
I'm gonna come back to you.

00:52.034 --> 00:54.299
- You promise?
- Promise.

01:03.748 --> 01:07.048
<i>Spring cleaning,
a curious ritual.</i>

01:07.086 --> 01:09.179
<i>Nicole said it meant time
to rid ourselves</i>

01:09.255 --> 01:11.451
<i>of things we didn't need anymore.</i>

01:20.234 --> 01:23.068
<i>The first step is reflection.</i>

01:23.138 --> 01:25.163
<i>What's worth keeping?</i>

01:25.240 --> 01:28.505
<i>What's lost its value
and can be given away?</i>

01:39.456 --> 01:42.290
<i>For some, the choice is easy.</i>

01:47.566 --> 01:49.625
<i>For others, much more difficult.</i>

01:49.669 --> 01:51.830
Wow! Getting rid of all that.

01:53.105 --> 01:55.267
Actually, I've gone through, and...

01:55.309 --> 01:58.836
I like all my things.
I don't want to give them away.

01:58.879 --> 02:01.747
Oh, Kyle, you don't have to, but

02:01.783 --> 02:03.774
a lot of this stuff
has seen its best day.

02:03.851 --> 02:07.344
Look at this T-shirt.
It's shrunk, it's stained, it's faded.

02:07.389 --> 02:09.380
I wore this the first time
Stephen took me to work.

02:09.425 --> 02:11.894
Well, this one's torn.

02:11.928 --> 02:14.021
I ripped it playing
basketball with Josh.

02:14.097 --> 02:15.689
Great game.

02:16.833 --> 02:20.930
- The first gift Lori ever gave me.
- Sentimental pack rat. Great.

02:21.005 --> 02:25.170
We're in trouble.
Look, this isn't supposed to be torture.

02:25.243 --> 02:27.438
Consider it a chance
to shed your old skin,

02:27.512 --> 02:28.877
be someone new.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.344
Dude, take a load off.
Let's throw this puppy around for a few.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.118
Let me grab the rest of the boxes.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.251
- The boxes aren't going anywhere.
- But I told Nicole that I...

02:40.327 --> 02:43.855
The best part about spring cleaning
is ditching out on spring cleaning.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.630
You can't do it, can ya?
You always have to do the right thing.

02:48.704 --> 02:51.104
You always find a way
of putting fun before work.

02:51.140 --> 02:53.904
Alphabetical order,
my encyclopedic friend.

02:53.943 --> 02:55.912
I'll have you know,
I'm done with my room.

02:55.946 --> 02:58.642
And I'm trashing this
with the rest of my stuff.

02:58.682 --> 03:00.913
But first...

03:00.952 --> 03:05.013
- Bite marks.
- Foam. It's irresistible.

03:05.123 --> 03:06.751
Come on.
Show me what you got.

03:09.194 --> 03:10.252
OK.

03:15.668 --> 03:16.896
Keep going.

03:19.473 --> 03:20.872
More.

03:32.722 --> 03:33.950
Whoa!

04:23.714 --> 04:26.240
- You didn't tell me you were coming.
- No one knows.

04:26.318 --> 04:29.515
- I'm surprising my mom.
- You're a good present.

04:29.554 --> 04:32.718
- How's New York?
- Amazing. Everything I imagined.

04:32.792 --> 04:34.487
And the music program?

04:34.527 --> 04:36.324
The teachers are all so inspiring.

04:36.362 --> 04:39.025
And the students there are so talented.

04:39.099 --> 04:43.001
- Like you.
- They've all had incredible training.

04:43.036 --> 04:45.699
It was intimidating at first,
but I'm in good company.

04:45.740 --> 04:47.401
I'm learning about composers...

04:47.475 --> 04:51.071
<i>Amanda's heart was beating
rapidly, and she was speaking fast.</i>

04:51.113 --> 04:53.707
<i>She seemed happy,
but I could sense she was troubled.</i>

04:53.782 --> 04:56.877
- I'm already a better technical player.
- Amanda...

04:56.953 --> 04:59.080
...is everything all right?

05:03.861 --> 05:05.829
I can never hide anything from you.

05:05.863 --> 05:09.163
But I need to let my mom know I'm home.
Can we get together later?

05:09.201 --> 05:12.602
- Of course.
- Good.

05:13.372 --> 05:15.534
I guess we need to talk.

05:19.245 --> 05:22.215
- She said what?
- "We need to talk."

05:27.722 --> 05:30.316
- What is it?
- Nothing.

05:31.826 --> 05:33.158
No, I missed something.

05:34.730 --> 05:38.633
Well, when someone says,
"We need to talk,"

05:38.702 --> 05:41.500
sometimes it's a lead-in
to a discussion

05:41.572 --> 05:45.100
- about feelings that have changed.
- Feelings?

05:45.143 --> 05:47.202
Prepare yourself.
She's dumping you.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.439
At least she has the decency
to do it in person.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.279
Don't read into it. Just wait
and hear what she has to say.

05:52.351 --> 05:55.582
No. Not my lucky shirt.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.385
Josh, you've outgrown it.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.120
<i>I couldn't help but wonder,</i>

06:00.160 --> 06:02.458
<i>had Amanda already outgrown me?</i>

06:08.569 --> 06:12.267
OK, grab hold of the wire
and make these babies blink.

06:12.307 --> 06:13.467
What?

06:13.542 --> 06:16.341
You turned a block of headlights on.
This should be easy.

06:16.379 --> 06:19.712
- Are you serious?
- You said I look for ways to slack off.

06:19.749 --> 06:23.117
This I take seriously. You have
to challenge that brilliant mind,

06:23.153 --> 06:25.178
and someone has to fill in for Foss.

06:25.256 --> 06:27.919
Well, that someone,
my friend, will be me.

06:28.026 --> 06:31.518
- Really?
- Just make 'em blink.

06:44.778 --> 06:48.374
- Hey. Is it working?
- Not really.

06:48.416 --> 06:51.249
Thinking about Amanda drained
all the voltage out of him.

06:51.319 --> 06:54.483
I heard. "We need to talk."

06:54.523 --> 06:58.392
- Sorry she left you hangin'.
- Typical woman.

06:58.461 --> 07:01.521
Uh, anyway, I need to look
for my digital projector.

07:01.598 --> 07:02.792
You giving that away?

07:02.866 --> 07:05.267
No. I need it for a lecture
I'm giving at U-Dub.

07:05.336 --> 07:07.531
You're giving a lecture?

07:09.674 --> 07:13.008
I mean you're giving a lecture.

07:13.045 --> 07:16.447
I've been asked to speak
at a symposium tomorrow.

07:16.482 --> 07:18.006
Are you getting paid for this?

07:18.051 --> 07:22.113
Because you're supposed to bring home
the bacon, and I eat a lot of bacon.

07:22.189 --> 07:24.919
For your information,
I have already had a job offer.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.688
This lecture is about
sharing my expertise... for free.

07:27.728 --> 07:30.163
I think your expertise
is worth more than that.

07:30.198 --> 07:33.497
Thank you, Kyle.
I'll let you two get back to work.

07:46.751 --> 07:50.414
- What's that?
- Just an old magazine.

07:50.488 --> 07:53.083
- You done in your room? -
- Yep.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.992
And now I need permission
to boycott an assignment.

07:56.028 --> 08:00.489
- Let me guess: math.
- Nope. Me.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.001
My guidance counselor
is making everyone

08:03.069 --> 08:05.436
write a two-page essay
about who you really are.

08:05.473 --> 08:07.532
I don't know the answer to that yet.

08:07.575 --> 08:09.668
How old were you
when you figured that out?

08:09.744 --> 08:12.646
I'll tell you when I get there.
Figuring out who you are

08:12.681 --> 08:16.378
- is a constantly evolving process.
- Constantly evolving process.

08:16.418 --> 08:20.947
- Three words. I need more.
- Sarcastic, moody and cynical?

08:20.990 --> 08:24.654
I didn't ask you. And I'm not a cynic.

08:26.263 --> 08:28.788
I am totally "glass is half full."

08:28.866 --> 08:30.892
I acknowledge
the other half of the glass

08:31.002 --> 08:35.599
is a desolate void of disappointment,
misery and regret.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.337
- Preparing makes me pragmatic.
- Uh, speaking of being prepared...

08:39.412 --> 08:43.008
Homework? Done.
I know. You should call Ripley's.

08:43.049 --> 08:46.610
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.

08:46.653 --> 08:49.350
- What do you guys think? Plaid?
- Definitely.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.880
Thanks.

08:50.925 --> 08:53.486
You and Amanda should
take a walk around the marina.

08:53.529 --> 08:55.019
Sunsets are really pretty.

08:57.132 --> 08:58.759
Maybe we will.

09:04.207 --> 09:05.835
Dead man walking.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.926
- Hi.
- Hello.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.430
- Can I come in?
- There's a front door.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.490
I wanted to see you. This is quicker.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.370
- What happened?
- Oh, I slipped and hit my shoulder.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.538
Jumping off another roof?

09:38.581 --> 09:41.880
Kyle, I've learned my lesson.
And I'm here to learn another one.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.978
You said I have to work my way up
to levitate, so start teaching.

09:45.055 --> 09:48.048
- I can't.
- There's nobody around.

09:48.092 --> 09:50.390
I have plans tonight with Amanda.

09:52.029 --> 09:54.794
- Oh, Amanda. She's home?
- As a surprise.

09:54.833 --> 09:59.861
You're anxious about it. Your heart's
beating really fast. I can tell.

10:01.474 --> 10:04.875
- She told me, "We need to talk."
- So?

10:04.911 --> 10:08.678
- You don't think that means anything?
- Uh...

10:08.716 --> 10:11.514
It means she wants to talk to you?

10:11.552 --> 10:15.080
- Isn't that a good thing?
- That's what I thought.

10:15.123 --> 10:19.288
So when can we get started?

10:19.328 --> 10:21.489
When Amanda goes back, I'll have time.

10:21.564 --> 10:22.724
OK.

10:22.765 --> 10:26.293
- Well... goodbye.
- Bye.

10:46.760 --> 10:48.455
You ready?

10:53.067 --> 10:55.332
Kyle, I can't go out.

10:55.370 --> 10:57.361
But you said we need to talk.

10:57.439 --> 10:58.963
I'm sorry. I can't see you.

10:59.007 --> 11:02.171
Amanda? Inside!

11:09.687 --> 11:12.281
- This is all your fault.
- What?

11:12.389 --> 11:15.382
My daughter flying clear across
the country to surprise me.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.291
You're not happy she's home?

11:17.362 --> 11:21.493
I'd be happy if she hadn't used my
birthday to tell me she's dropping out.

11:21.567 --> 11:25.937
- Drop out of the conservatory? Why?
- You didn't know you're the reason?

11:26.006 --> 11:27.667
She didn't say anything to me.

11:27.708 --> 11:30.472
- We haven't talked.
- You're not gonna get that chance.

11:30.510 --> 11:33.878
You will not speak to Amanda
until she's back where she belongs,

11:33.948 --> 11:35.882
at that school.

11:42.358 --> 11:45.328
I don't understand why she won't
let me speak to Amanda.

11:45.362 --> 11:49.025
Well, unfortunately,
Mrs. Bloom sees you as a distraction.

11:49.099 --> 11:52.968
I just want to know what happened,
make sure she's OK.

11:53.037 --> 11:55.403
Well, put yourself
in Mrs. Bloom's shoes.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.640
What I mean is, try to see things
from her perspective.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.443
That music conservatory
sounds like a big opportunity,

12:02.515 --> 12:06.042
- one that Amanda shouldn't miss.
- I don't want her to miss it.

12:06.085 --> 12:09.021
But Mrs. Bloom shouldn't
force her to go back.

12:09.056 --> 12:12.150
I'm afraid Mrs. Bloom
has every right to send Amanda back,

12:12.192 --> 12:13.716
whether she wants to go or not.

12:13.761 --> 12:16.424
Just as she has the right
to ask you to stay away.

12:16.464 --> 12:20.401
And the hard truth is...
it's really none of our business.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.927
You know what Amanda means to me.

12:22.972 --> 12:26.431
If she's confused about something,
how could it be none of my business?

12:31.915 --> 12:35.147
I know you're bummed,
but look at the bright side.

12:35.219 --> 12:37.449
Which, by the way, is my new M.O.

12:37.522 --> 12:39.548
Amanda wasn't planning on dumping you.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.115
How do you know that?

12:41.193 --> 12:44.094
Mrs. Bloom blames you
for ruining her life.

12:44.129 --> 12:47.725
Amanda flying home was a case
of "girl missing boy next door."

12:47.801 --> 12:50.794
We don't know that.
We don't know anything Amanda's feeling.

12:50.838 --> 12:53.306
- No one's letting her explain.
- Even Mom and Dad.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.365
I can't believe they're with Mrs. Bloom.

12:55.409 --> 12:59.642
I can't believe we're siding with Carol.
She's uptight, narrow-minded...

12:59.681 --> 13:02.206
Yeah, and those
are her good qualities.

13:02.284 --> 13:04.981
We have to respect
what she wants for her daughter.

13:05.054 --> 13:07.545
Kyle has shown nothing
but love for Amanda.

13:07.590 --> 13:09.081
Now we have to keep them apart?

13:09.126 --> 13:11.959
Knowing Kyle,
he'd make the situation a lot better

13:11.995 --> 13:16.899
- if he were allowed to talk to her.
- You remember being Kyle's age?

13:16.935 --> 13:19.199
Something like this
takes over your life.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.398
That's half the fun of being in love.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.705
Now we have to be the buzz kills,
the grown-ups.

13:24.777 --> 13:26.802
If this is what
being a grown-up means...

13:26.879 --> 13:29.144
It sucks. Why can't
Mom and Dad do something?

13:29.182 --> 13:30.672
They can't cross the line.

13:30.717 --> 13:33.915
They're all about crossing the line
when something's not fair.

13:33.988 --> 13:36.650
Throw Mom your "puppy dog
in a thunderstorm" look.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.056
- Get her to change her mind.
- They made it clear.

13:39.093 --> 13:40.994
I have to obey Mrs. Bloom's request.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.660
This isn't right.
I can't just stand back and do nothing.

13:45.735 --> 13:49.671
- Kyle, do I detect defiance?
- Genius joins the dark side.

13:49.739 --> 13:52.208
I've got rules
I've been dying for you to break.

13:52.276 --> 13:54.710
I don't want to break any rules.

13:56.714 --> 13:58.342
I won't have to.

13:58.383 --> 14:01.546
I'll do exactly what
Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.

14:02.788 --> 14:05.690
Atta boy, Kyle. Take a stand.

14:07.693 --> 14:09.354
Why are your feet on my bed?

14:14.601 --> 14:16.661
<i>There were ways
to contact Amanda</i>

14:16.704 --> 14:19.036
<i>without seeing or speaking to her.</i>

14:29.653 --> 14:33.214
<i>I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom
without leaving my own house.</i>

14:49.309 --> 14:52.073
<i>It seemed she could find ways
to thwart me just as easily.</i>

14:53.981 --> 14:56.541
<i>If electronic messages
weren't getting through,</i>

14:56.584 --> 14:59.053
<i>there would be no way
to send a note or a letter</i>

14:59.087 --> 15:01.555
<i>without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it.</i>

15:04.427 --> 15:08.887
<i>I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
The written word was no longer an option.</i>

15:08.931 --> 15:11.992
<i>But there were still a few notes
I could send her way.</i>

15:12.035 --> 15:14.094
<i>I hoped this message
would get through</i>

15:14.137 --> 15:17.107
<i>and she would at least know
I was thinking about her.</i>

15:30.090 --> 15:33.059
- I was just trying...
- I know what you were doing.

15:35.263 --> 15:37.094
I think you better come in now.

16:00.091 --> 16:02.616
What? You want my music now, too?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.720
You've confiscated
my phone, computer.

16:04.763 --> 16:09.064
- I know this is hard to understand...
- That you're keeping me prisoner?

16:09.101 --> 16:12.071
You will leave this house
when you agree to return to New York

16:12.105 --> 16:14.403
to become the pianist
you're meant to be.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.908
Mom, I'm not seven years old anymore.

16:16.944 --> 16:19.709
Think I don't get that this
is a great opportunity for me?

16:19.781 --> 16:22.944
- Why throw it away?
- Because it's not right for me now.

16:24.687 --> 16:28.919
- It's not what I want.
- You don't know what you want.

16:40.838 --> 16:44.798
Dude, the crispity, crunchity goodness
in that bowl is long gone.

16:45.811 --> 16:50.044
- I'm not really hungry.
- My essay sucks.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.846
Speaking of sucks...

16:51.884 --> 16:53.909
What? I meant Shakespeare.

16:55.622 --> 16:57.647
Extra credit. Impressive.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.820
Impressive would be figuring out
what language this was in.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.625
I thought Kyle might
be able to translate, but...

17:08.704 --> 17:10.228
Well, what part are you at?

17:10.306 --> 17:14.242
Part that says it's about two
families and it's set in "fair Verona."

17:14.310 --> 17:15.642
The first two lines.

17:15.679 --> 17:19.548
She lives 38 feet, nine inches away,
and I can't even tell her I'm sorry.

17:19.584 --> 17:21.882
You could if she wasn't
locked in her own house.

17:21.919 --> 17:25.013
Who else but Mrs. Bloom changes
the alarm code to keep someone in?

17:25.057 --> 17:27.582
I just hope Amanda doesn't
feel as bad as I do.

17:27.626 --> 17:30.960
Looks like we have our own resident pair
of star-crossed lovers.

17:30.997 --> 17:33.488
The balcony scene's
her favorite part of the play.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.763
Of course, it didn't end well for them.

17:35.802 --> 17:39.000
So Romeo and Juliet did everything
in their power to be together.

17:39.073 --> 17:41.735
You guys know how this ends?
Why didn't you say so?

17:44.613 --> 17:47.776
This all began when Amanda
said we needed to talk.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.682
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

17:50.953 --> 17:54.981
- I can write my essay later.
- Whatever it is, I'm in.

17:56.794 --> 18:00.662
Wait a minute.
I'll do just about anything but that.

18:00.697 --> 18:03.667
If you want to help, you have to commit,
take this seriously.

18:03.701 --> 18:07.433
Then let me drive
the getaway car instead.

18:07.473 --> 18:09.236
Or I could create a diversion.

18:09.275 --> 18:11.539
Hey, you want in?
Accept the assignment.

18:11.577 --> 18:14.945
Then I guess I'll see
if I can borrow one of Andy's.

18:15.916 --> 18:19.512
- What can I do to help?
- Help what?

18:19.554 --> 18:22.955
Help Kyle have a night out with Amanda
like you've been talking about.

18:22.990 --> 18:25.357
How do you know what?
You just sat down.

18:26.128 --> 18:29.564
I listened in while I was sitting
at that table over there.

18:29.598 --> 18:31.794
I thought you had
the copyright on that move.

18:31.835 --> 18:35.293
- I can do anything Kyle can do.
- Could you make out with Amanda?

18:35.338 --> 18:36.805
'Cause that would be hot.

18:38.642 --> 18:41.338
It's a common male fantasy
to watch two women make out.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.506
Number six on popular top-ten lists,

18:43.548 --> 18:45.846
but it's not backed
by statistical evidence.

18:45.884 --> 18:47.613
That's all really fascinating,

18:47.686 --> 18:50.986
but I think what she really needs
to learn is the meaning of privacy.

18:53.259 --> 18:56.320
Bitchy, not cynical. A total difference.

18:56.363 --> 18:57.694
I was just trying to help.

18:57.764 --> 19:00.198
Actually, I think there is
something you can do.

19:16.553 --> 19:17.747
Can I help you?

19:17.787 --> 19:20.552
Hi. Is Amanda home? I'm a friend.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.822
I've seen you going in
and out of the Trager house.

19:23.861 --> 19:27.229
- You're Lori's trampy friend.
- Oh, no, that's Hillary.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.724
Well, whoever you are,
Amanda is not allowed to have visitors.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.762
Oh, but do tell Kyle nice try.

19:41.482 --> 19:42.813
Hey! Dad!

19:42.883 --> 19:45.512
Josh. Guess who was a hit
at the symposium.

19:45.587 --> 19:48.385
- I knew you'd be.
- I was nervous when I got there,

19:48.423 --> 19:51.325
but I look out and see
a room full of computer science geeks.

19:51.394 --> 19:52.588
My peeps.

19:52.628 --> 19:56.929
Sounds like really fulfilling
and fascinating stuff.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.867
Say, uh, why don't you take a load off,

19:58.902 --> 20:00.927
and I'll put that projector
away for you.

20:00.971 --> 20:02.940
Sure. Thanks.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.584
- That's our block?
- On a map of the power grid.

20:17.624 --> 20:21.891
- There's our house and Amanda's.
- And how does that help?

20:21.929 --> 20:24.159
I need to know how
the neighborhood is wired.

20:24.232 --> 20:26.632
This has high-voltage
cables, transformers,

20:26.701 --> 20:28.567
utility lines, breaker panels.

20:29.738 --> 20:32.571
It's part of the plan.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.099
I'm back.

20:35.111 --> 20:38.979
- Jessi, please try to use the...
- Oh, front door. Right.

20:40.017 --> 20:43.111
- How'd it go?
- 12154.

20:46.024 --> 20:48.584
So I'll see you at the Rack later?

20:48.627 --> 20:49.719
OK. Bye.

20:52.331 --> 20:53.696
She was done, right?

20:55.101 --> 20:56.693
I should probably get going.

21:06.614 --> 21:08.741
Um, didn't you just leave?

21:08.816 --> 21:13.845
I wanted to talk to you, and Kyle said
that I should use the front door.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.184
OK.

21:19.863 --> 21:23.231
Your parents didn't press charges,
and they could have.

21:23.267 --> 21:27.294
They understand that
what I did to you wasn't me.

21:27.338 --> 21:31.105
- I'm really lucky that they do.
- Yeah. You are.

21:32.644 --> 21:36.206
Kyle explained everything to you.
I didn't want to beat you up.

21:36.249 --> 21:39.480
It was my programming.
Things went wrong.

21:39.552 --> 21:43.182
So, what, you caused the most
traumatic experience of my life,

21:43.223 --> 21:45.350
and you're telling me
it's not your fault?

21:47.095 --> 21:48.653
I'm telling you I'm sorry.

21:49.798 --> 21:52.199
I'm not here to ruin things anymore.

21:52.234 --> 21:54.498
I'm here to help.

21:54.537 --> 21:56.061
I'm trying.

22:00.510 --> 22:02.205
Then I guess I can try, too.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.175
OK.

22:11.890 --> 22:14.620
- Hey. Want some help?
- Oh, dig in.

22:16.496 --> 22:18.964
Hey, I thought you got rid of this.

22:19.032 --> 22:23.470
Yeah, I got a little nostalgic
and rescued it from the reject pile.

22:23.504 --> 22:26.234
I got a little nostalgic myself today.

22:26.273 --> 22:28.503
Being back on campus again.

22:28.542 --> 22:32.639
No office politics, no corporate crap,
just this flow of ideas.

22:32.714 --> 22:36.742
It was a real give-and-take.
I forgot how satisfying that can be.

22:36.786 --> 22:39.448
It's been a long time
since you talked about teaching.

22:39.489 --> 22:42.755
Yeah, I know.
I was surprised when the feeling hit me.

22:42.793 --> 22:46.058
I was also surprised when the head
of the computer science program

22:46.096 --> 22:50.295
- mentioned an adjunct professorship.
- Stephen, that's great. Two job offers.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.599
No, no, no. Just the one.
I turned him down.

22:52.637 --> 22:53.969
Why?

22:54.039 --> 22:56.166
You want to get back in the
public sector,

22:56.208 --> 22:59.770
and I already have a fantastic job.
I mean, it's a great salary.

22:59.813 --> 23:03.271
I'd be the senior VP
in charge of software development.

23:03.316 --> 23:06.343
Yeah, at a company that makes
elevator control panels.

23:06.421 --> 23:08.821
It's not as exciting
as a career change, I admit,

23:08.856 --> 23:11.917
but at least this time around,
I won't have an evil boss.

23:47.100 --> 23:48.830
How'd it go?

23:48.870 --> 23:51.896
- Mission accomplished.
- Excellent.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.841
So far. What you're planning
is so out there,

23:54.877 --> 23:58.142
- no way everything will go right.
- Suzy Cynic.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.214
Kyle, your plan is genius!

24:02.252 --> 24:05.619
It's totally optimistic,
at least what I understand of it.

24:05.655 --> 24:08.819
- Thank you.
- So, what's next?

24:08.926 --> 24:12.158
Jessi got the alarm code, and you
got her to pull down the shade,

24:12.197 --> 24:13.858
so on to phase two.

24:19.038 --> 24:21.632
Here you go. Phase two.

24:24.278 --> 24:26.246
Now we just wait for dark.

24:27.014 --> 24:29.539
I have unwavering faith
and support your exploits,

24:29.583 --> 24:31.882
- but how is that a plan?
- Got something better?

24:31.920 --> 24:36.118
There's a lot at stake for Kyle's sake,
and I don't want anything to go wrong.

24:36.191 --> 24:38.217
Why would it?
Kyle's covered all angles.

24:38.261 --> 24:39.285
I'm sure he has.

24:39.362 --> 24:41.956
Why don't you just relax?
Kyle's plan has to work.

24:41.998 --> 24:44.968
He won't get to Amanda
before she's gone for good.

24:50.909 --> 24:53.173
I think phase two has been activated.

24:59.852 --> 25:03.380
Think about Amanda,
how much you want to see her,

25:03.490 --> 25:05.048
to hold her...

25:07.795 --> 25:10.491
...to touch her.
- Josh, ew.

25:10.531 --> 25:14.229
- What? He needs an emotional trigger.
- The other thing I need is silence.

25:14.269 --> 25:18.035
- Good idea. Lori, out.
- What did I do?

25:18.106 --> 25:20.701
This is man's work.

25:20.743 --> 25:23.075
I so want to make a joke right now.

25:28.452 --> 25:30.044
She could have stayed.

25:30.120 --> 25:34.023
Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy,
and I didn't want her to hear it.

25:34.059 --> 25:37.587
Listen, Kyle,
I get how messed up you are right now.

25:37.697 --> 25:40.291
If anybody told me
I couldn't see Andy ever again,

25:40.399 --> 25:43.858
I'd be a mess, too.
But you've got to pull it together.

25:43.904 --> 25:47.271
- You really think I can do this?
- How much you care about Amanda?

25:47.341 --> 25:49.309
Zero doubts. Come on.

25:49.344 --> 25:53.440
Deep breaths. Just take it slow,
one bulb at a time.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.328
<i>By focusing,</i>

26:11.369 --> 26:14.066
<i>I could control the flow
of electrons along the wire,</i>

26:14.106 --> 26:17.405
<i>much like driving a car
along a narrow road.</i>

26:27.755 --> 26:32.386
<i>In this case, the road led into the
Trager house's electrical system,</i>

26:32.460 --> 26:35.588
<i>which in turn connected
to the neighborhood transformer.</i>

26:35.630 --> 26:38.998
<i>Through the transformer, I was able
to reach Amanda's house and gain</i>

26:39.035 --> 26:42.334
<i>access to the house's electrical system.</i>

26:42.371 --> 26:45.136
<i>Once inside, I could direct
the flow of electrons</i>

26:45.175 --> 26:47.905
<i>through the wires hidden in the walls.</i>

26:49.746 --> 26:52.682
<i>I was able to find
my way to Amanda's room.</i>

26:54.185 --> 26:57.349
<i>Finally, I got my message through.</i>

26:57.423 --> 27:00.324
<i>And finally, we would
have our chance to talk.</i>

27:00.392 --> 27:01.484
Phase three.

27:52.053 --> 27:53.850
You owe me... big.

27:56.190 --> 27:58.921
Trager, you really embraced
your inner Hallmark card.

27:58.961 --> 28:00.622
You've gone soft.

28:00.662 --> 28:03.325
I know.
You can cut the irony with a spoon.

28:04.467 --> 28:07.027
I just hope it's worth it.

28:08.071 --> 28:11.166
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

28:14.311 --> 28:15.973
All this for puppy love?

28:16.014 --> 28:18.676
What are the odds
that the person you're gonna spend

28:18.717 --> 28:21.185
the rest of your life with
is the girl next door?

28:21.219 --> 28:24.451
I mean, I don't want to put a bad mojo
on the whole love vibe,

28:24.524 --> 28:28.393
but I don't want to set Kyle up to get
his heart chopped, sliced and diced.

28:30.664 --> 28:32.495
God, that felt good.

28:33.835 --> 28:35.564
Did you see where I put the napkins?

28:37.939 --> 28:39.874
Is there a garlic convention in here?

28:39.909 --> 28:42.377
- Too much?
- Never.

28:42.411 --> 28:45.642
- What's the occasion?
- Take your pick.

28:45.714 --> 28:48.309
I feel guilty about discouraging Kyle.

28:48.385 --> 28:52.117
I appreciate the life we have
and that we have such good kids.

28:52.190 --> 28:56.650
- Um, I'm incredibly hungry.
- How about all of the above?

28:58.764 --> 29:02.256
Stephen. You mentioned Amanda
would be missing an opportunity.

29:02.334 --> 29:06.066
- You ever feel that way?
- What makes you think I do?

29:06.105 --> 29:10.064
Spring cleaning. Dragging the past out
of the closets, seeing who we've become.

29:10.110 --> 29:13.238
- You still look great in a bikini.
- I wouldn't know.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.305
I haven't worn one since Josh was born.

29:15.349 --> 29:17.545
Remember how I was supposed
to be the cool mom

29:17.619 --> 29:20.554
who published thought-provoking
articles and had a career?

29:20.589 --> 29:23.559
All I've accomplished this weekend
is loads of laundry.

29:23.593 --> 29:27.495
Not to mention an insanely
aromatic marinara sauce.

29:29.499 --> 29:31.467
There was a time
when I wanted to teach,

29:31.535 --> 29:35.768
but I don't feel like I'm really missing
anything. I never went down that path.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.808
You went the corporate route
to support our family.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.935
Which I wouldn't trade for anything.

29:41.814 --> 29:45.409
- Why don't you go gather the troops?
- All right. I'm on it.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.419
- Hey. Is she coming?
- I hope so. She got my message.

29:53.461 --> 29:56.897
It's not the best time, but can
we add the electrical trick to the list?

29:56.931 --> 29:58.398
I really want to learn that.

29:58.466 --> 30:00.958
After Amanda goes back,
when you have time.

30:01.036 --> 30:03.698
I'll make time. But I have
to make time for Amanda, too.

30:03.772 --> 30:06.936
- She might be staying.
- Oh, she's staying?

30:06.976 --> 30:09.069
She doesn't want to go back.

30:11.081 --> 30:15.017
- You're surprised.
- No, it's... it's good news for you.

30:15.085 --> 30:16.677
- Do you know why?
- Not yet.

30:16.754 --> 30:18.814
But now I'll have a chance to find out.

30:20.425 --> 30:23.486
Thank you for your help.

30:38.079 --> 30:40.309
Your dinner was getting cold.

30:42.017 --> 30:44.383
I know you're not very
happy with me right now,

30:44.453 --> 30:47.912
but I am only looking out
for your best interests.

30:51.728 --> 30:54.926
I made that noodle casserole
you like so much.

30:56.567 --> 30:57.795
Oh, Amanda.

31:08.648 --> 31:10.013
Phew!

31:10.049 --> 31:12.075
Hey, hon?

31:14.054 --> 31:15.487
Where the hell are they?

31:15.522 --> 31:17.957
This could be the biggest
move you bust all night,

31:18.026 --> 31:20.256
so we just want to make sure
you have it down.

31:20.328 --> 31:21.955
You meet her at the door.

31:22.998 --> 31:26.901
Compliment her.
Walk her over to the table.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.437
- Offer her a seat.
- Yes. Care to demonstrate?

31:34.978 --> 31:37.971
- Would you like a seat?
- No, no.

31:38.016 --> 31:41.076
You have to pull the chair out for her.

31:41.119 --> 31:43.247
Oh.

31:43.288 --> 31:46.189
And then just slip it
underneath her as she sits.

31:46.225 --> 31:48.592
Not too fast, or you'll
take her out at the knees.

31:48.628 --> 31:51.222
Right. Not too fast.

31:53.533 --> 31:56.059
Why am I even worried?
You'll be fine.

31:58.939 --> 32:00.498
Does it look OK?

32:07.750 --> 32:08.910
Perfect.

32:22.901 --> 32:24.630
I love this.

32:24.669 --> 32:28.401
The lights, the table, everything.

32:28.441 --> 32:31.605
And the window in my room.
How'd you even get the idea for that?

32:31.645 --> 32:35.172
<i>Romeo and Juliet.
Act two, scene two, line two.</i>

32:35.248 --> 32:38.844
- The balcony scene. That's...
- Your favorite scene in the play.

32:38.886 --> 32:41.684
I like that you pay attention
to weird little details.

32:42.690 --> 32:43.749
You do?

32:46.161 --> 32:49.461
- You're blushing.
- I am?

32:50.934 --> 32:53.664
I shouldn't have said that.
I totally embarrassed you.

32:53.736 --> 32:58.037
No. Amanda, you can always say
whatever you want with me.

33:03.615 --> 33:07.712
Glazed Cornish game hens
on a bed of sautéed greens,

33:07.787 --> 33:10.255
sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus,

33:10.323 --> 33:12.382
with shaved Romano and pancetta.

33:16.330 --> 33:18.161
I don't think this is what we ordered.

33:18.198 --> 33:21.259
Right. 'Cause nothing says romance
like a smoked turkey wrap.

33:21.336 --> 33:24.828
- I took some liberties with the menu.
- You made this?

33:24.873 --> 33:27.968
<i>No one knows I'm secretly
a fan of Top Chef.</i>

33:28.010 --> 33:31.446
<i>And no one ever will.
Bon appétit.</i>

33:35.819 --> 33:37.218
Stop staring.

33:38.222 --> 33:42.556
I can't. I'm ODing on suspense.
I want to know how it's going.

33:42.627 --> 33:45.153
You want to know if it's going badly.

33:45.197 --> 33:49.156
What you witnessed earlier was a
completely uncharacteristic outburst.

33:49.201 --> 33:51.670
No, it's how you really feel.

33:51.704 --> 33:55.697
It was just a mini meltdown brought on
by some stupid homework assignment.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.678
"Who You Really Are" essay?
No one takes that seriously.

34:00.147 --> 34:03.140
Well, almost no one.

34:03.185 --> 34:05.449
It was recently brought to my attention

34:05.520 --> 34:09.514
that I am always the girl with the wry
commentary and the patented eye roll.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.123
Honest question.

34:13.161 --> 34:14.527
Do you think I'm a cynic?

34:14.565 --> 34:16.726
Honest answer? Absolutely.

34:16.766 --> 34:19.634
You're Miss Possible But Not Likely.

34:19.670 --> 34:23.004
About my own life? Of course.

34:23.041 --> 34:26.603
But watching those two, who am I to say
they're not meant for each other?

34:26.679 --> 34:29.147
I mean, look at them.
Have you ever seen two people

34:29.215 --> 34:32.081
get each other like Kyle and Amanda?

34:33.620 --> 34:34.985
Not in a while.

34:50.138 --> 34:52.539
Amanda, you said we need to talk.

34:52.609 --> 34:53.701
Right.

34:56.411 --> 34:59.246
You didn't think I meant...

34:59.283 --> 35:00.375
Maybe a little.

35:01.385 --> 35:03.251
After a few people weighed in.

35:03.288 --> 35:06.314
The one time you didn't
take my words literally.

35:06.358 --> 35:08.883
Did you really think
my feelings had changed?

35:08.927 --> 35:13.297
- Is that why you brought me here?
- Everyone was making assumptions

35:13.332 --> 35:16.860
about what you wanted and how you
were feeling and what was right for you.

35:16.903 --> 35:19.371
But no one was actually asking you.

35:21.509 --> 35:25.104
That's why my feelings
for you could never change.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.567
Didn't know the lights
out here twinkled.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.866
Only for you.

35:49.608 --> 35:52.840
You have no idea how
disappointed I am right now!

35:52.879 --> 35:54.471
- Mom...
- Save your excuses!

35:54.514 --> 35:56.573
Your flight leaves
in less than two hours.

35:56.616 --> 35:58.244
- My flight...
- You heard me.

35:58.285 --> 36:01.550
- But you haven't heard her.
- You have nothing to say in the matter!

36:01.588 --> 36:05.355
But I do! Don't you even care?
I'm not happy at the conservatory.

36:05.393 --> 36:09.420
Of course I care! But I also care
about scholarships, opportunities.

36:09.497 --> 36:12.729
- I care about your future.
- If you really cared about my future,

36:12.768 --> 36:15.396
you would not have sold
my piano in the first place.

36:21.511 --> 36:25.505
- Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Get in the car now.

36:29.922 --> 36:33.323
- I have to go.
- I understand.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.231
I hope you're satisfied.

36:50.645 --> 36:53.012
It took all my will power
not to trip her.

36:54.650 --> 36:56.982
Thank you for letting me know
Amanda was here.

36:57.019 --> 36:58.281
Glad I could help.

37:06.965 --> 37:08.296
Welcome home.

37:08.333 --> 37:12.168
I'd ask you what you were thinking, but
I don't think you were thinking at all.

37:12.238 --> 37:15.105
- This took a great deal of planning.
- Not helping.

37:15.207 --> 37:17.005
The Blooms' situation was private.

37:17.077 --> 37:19.602
We made it very clear
you were not to see Amanda,

37:19.646 --> 37:23.208
- you were not to get involved.
- I know I broke a rule,

37:23.251 --> 37:26.152
but I'm not sorry I did.
I had to do it for Amanda.

37:26.187 --> 37:28.280
Good intentions aside,
you're grounded.

37:28.322 --> 37:30.018
All of you. Two weeks.

37:30.092 --> 37:32.219
- What?
- School, work, home.

37:32.294 --> 37:35.628
Everything else is off-limits.
I'll take your cell phones.

37:35.665 --> 37:38.759
This was my idea.
Lori and Josh shouldn't be punished.

37:38.835 --> 37:40.996
- They were just helping.
- Exactly.

37:43.674 --> 37:44.732
What if Foss?

37:44.809 --> 37:47.301
If anyone important calls,
I'll have it with me.

37:47.345 --> 37:50.314
- Do I get one last call?
- No.

37:50.348 --> 37:53.044
But you do get to go to your rooms.

37:54.554 --> 37:56.419
Now.

38:04.731 --> 38:07.496
Grounding Kyle.
Who would have expected it?

38:07.535 --> 38:11.027
And he was the ringleader.
When did that start happening?

38:15.311 --> 38:17.006
Be honest.

38:17.112 --> 38:20.514
- You're kinda glad they did it.
- Well? Aren't you?

38:20.550 --> 38:22.643
Some rules are meant to be broken.

38:22.719 --> 38:25.348
About that.

38:25.389 --> 38:28.222
I think we should break some rules, too.

38:28.259 --> 38:32.219
Stephen, I don't want us to sail
into a complacent suburban existence

38:32.264 --> 38:33.925
without fighting the good fight.

38:33.966 --> 38:37.994
I want you to pursue
that opportunity at U-Dub.

38:38.071 --> 38:41.598
- That's not an option.
- Well, then we need to make it one.

38:41.674 --> 38:45.008
You can't get the chance to pursue
an old dream and just pass on it.

38:45.045 --> 38:48.573
- We have mouths to feed.
- We'll keep them fed.

38:50.585 --> 38:53.076
We'll make it work. We always do.

39:11.609 --> 39:15.774
<i>Spring cleaning isn't just
about getting rid of clutter.</i>

39:15.848 --> 39:19.945
<i>It's about taking stock of who you are
and how others see you.</i>

39:27.962 --> 39:30.487
<i>It's a chance to redefine yourself...</i>

39:33.268 --> 39:35.236
<i>...to change expectations.</i>

39:45.149 --> 39:48.641
<i>And to remember that it's never too late
to recapture who you were.</i>

39:56.762 --> 39:59.094
<i>Or to aim for who you want to be.</i>

40:12.380 --> 40:13.712
Take a seat.

40:17.886 --> 40:19.980
Where have you been?

40:20.924 --> 40:23.484
I was just out looking at the stars.

40:23.526 --> 40:26.985
You were stargazing
every night this week.

40:30.001 --> 40:31.833
How about the truth now?

40:34.473 --> 40:37.807
- I've been sneaking out.
- Obviously.

40:37.877 --> 40:39.174
Why?

40:40.680 --> 40:43.513
- To try things.
- Such as?

40:43.549 --> 40:45.381
Um...

40:47.321 --> 40:49.255
I've been testing myself.

40:50.592 --> 40:54.050
Getting stronger and faster.

40:54.095 --> 40:56.860
I shouldn't let people see,
that's why I do it at night.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.734
I don't know what to say.

41:00.736 --> 41:02.728
I expected that it would take you longer

41:02.773 --> 41:05.867
to get comfortable living here
before we were ready.

41:07.277 --> 41:10.873
- We?
- I have big plans for you, Jessi.

41:10.915 --> 41:15.319
And I need you to be as strong
and as smart as you can possibly be.

41:18.390 --> 41:20.222
How do we start?

41:21.861 --> 41:23.920
Well, first thing's first.

41:23.963 --> 41:25.590
You need to get some sleep.

41:25.632 --> 41:28.124
We'll talk about it
further in the morning.

41:28.169 --> 41:29.227
OK.

42:59.241 --> 43:02.142
Amanda. What happened?
Did your mother change her mind?

43:02.211 --> 43:04.373
No. I didn't get on the plane.

43:06.383 --> 43:07.782
Can you hide me?

43:12.757 --> 43:14.122
Come in.
