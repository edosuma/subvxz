What will you do with it?

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.108
She will be brought before

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:54.711
and until then I'll store
her in my cooling house,

01:14:54.713 --> 01:14:56.180
next to the Ice cream.

01:14:56.182 --> 01:14:57.882
Because I have an ice
cream truck, you know?

01:14:57.884 --> 01:14:59.383

child's tears, you know?

Tears, from the eyes,
of a child who is alone?

01:15:15.334 --> 01:15:18.202
You are a lonely child, aren't
you?

01:15:18.204 --> 01:15:21.072
