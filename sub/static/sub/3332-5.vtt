00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
Latin lover narrator:
<i>All right, here we go.</i>
<i>As you know,</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:06.772
<i>Jane was accidentally</i>
<i>artificially inseminated.</i>
<i>But I've never had sex.</i>

00:06.774 --> 00:09.174
<i>Needless to say,</i>
<i>her fiancÃ© was not pleased.</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:12.611
Please, for us,
don't have this baby.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.313
<i>But jane decided</i>
<i>to have the baby.</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:16.148
And we're giving it
to the father.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.649
He and his wife--
they really want it.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.485
<i>And they're a really</i>
<i>great couple.</i>

00:19.487 --> 00:20.619
Latin lover narrator:
<i>They weren't.</i>

00:20.621 --> 00:22.588
<i>In fact, michael realized</i>

00:22.590 --> 00:24.690
<i>Petra was having an affair</i>
<i>with roman zazo,</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:26.325
<i>Her husband's best friend.</i>

00:26.327 --> 00:28.093
End the affair, or
I'll tell your husband.

00:28.095 --> 00:30.062
And jane's not giving
that baby to him alone.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.164
<i>But that problem</i>
<i>took care of itself.</i>

00:32.165 --> 00:35.100
And unfortunately, rafael found
<i>out about the affair anyway.</i>

00:35.102 --> 00:36.135
We're done, petra.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.170
<i>And michael finally</i>

00:38.172 --> 00:40.139
<i>Got on board</i>
<i>with keeping the baby.</i>

00:40.141 --> 00:42.074
It's not just some other guy's
baby, it's yours, too.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.442
And if you want it, I am all in.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.244
<i>Luckily, she didn't want it.</i>

00:45.246 --> 00:46.512
And, speaking of complications,

00:46.514 --> 00:48.547
<i>Jane has just learned</i>
<i>that her dad is</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:50.482
<i>Telenovela star</i>
<i>rogelio de la vega.</i>

00:50.484 --> 00:52.117
I'm your father.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.452
All this time...

00:53.454 --> 00:56.655
You knew who my father was,

00:56.657 --> 00:59.224
And you didn't tell me?

00:59.226 --> 01:02.061
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And now we'll begin.</i>

01:02.063 --> 01:04.129
<i>As we all know by now,</i>

01:04.131 --> 01:07.466
<i>When jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>came into this world,</i>

01:07.468 --> 01:12.404
<i>Her father was already</i>
<i>out of the picture.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:14.606
<i>And though</i>
<i>she sometimes fantasized</i>

01:14.608 --> 01:16.275
<i>About who her father was</i>

01:16.277 --> 01:18.177
<i>And what having two parents</i>
<i>would be like...</i>

01:18.179 --> 01:20.179
Hurry up.
<i>Jane and her mom</i>

01:20.181 --> 01:22.781
<i>Had a typical mother-daughter</i>
<i>relationship.</i>

01:22.783 --> 01:25.484
(exhales)
what do you think?

01:28.154 --> 01:31.190
<i>With the role of the mother</i>
<i>played by jane.</i>

01:31.192 --> 01:33.192
I know.
The shoes are pushing it.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.560
What time
are you coming home?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.228
You have an interview tomorrow.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.330
Not till the afternoon.
2:30.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.299
I know. I get it. I'll
be home by midnight.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.600
Don't drink too much,

01:41.602 --> 01:43.235
Don't kiss too much,
and don't forget to call

01:43.237 --> 01:44.236
If you're gonna be late.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.338
Honey, don't worry.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.307
Love you.
<i>But jane did worry.</i>

01:48.309 --> 01:50.409
<i>Because if she didn't,</i>
<i>who would?</i>

01:50.411 --> 01:51.710
Alba:
Jane.

01:58.485 --> 02:01.386
<i>It was times like these</i>
<i>when young jane</i>

02:01.388 --> 02:04.723
<i>Wished especially hard</i>
<i>for a father.</i>

02:04.725 --> 02:07.259
<i>Someone responsible and wise,</i>

02:07.261 --> 02:09.261
<i>Someone who would take care</i>
<i>of things</i>

02:09.263 --> 02:11.530
<i>So she wouldn't have to.</i>

02:11.532 --> 02:12.564
<i>Someone like...</i>

02:12.566 --> 02:14.566
<i>Jimmy smits.</i>

02:14.568 --> 02:17.269
<i>See, jane held</i>
<i>a secret suspicion</i>

02:17.271 --> 02:19.204
<i>That jimmy smits</i>
<i>was her father.</i>

02:19.206 --> 02:22.307
<i>And she was equally sure</i>
<i>he'd come home any minute.</i>

02:22.309 --> 02:27.312
<i>But, alas, jane's father</i>
<i>was not jimmy smits.</i>

02:27.314 --> 02:31.450
<i>He was, however, a star</i>
<i>that burned just as bright.</i>

02:33.686 --> 02:36.688
I do. I'm sorry,
abuela, but I do.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.928
She had 23 years to correct it,
and she didn't.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.296
She just kept lying.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.632
Please, abuela,
stop, all right?

02:46.634 --> 02:48.300
I just need some space
from her right now.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.303
Jane. Jane, come on.
We need to talk.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.739
We don't.
We do not have to.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.774
I made a mistake.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.943
A mistake?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.412
A mistake is losing your keys.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.314
You kept my
father from me.
I know.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.682
I'm sorry.

03:06.319 --> 03:07.953
(door opens)

03:07.955 --> 03:11.223
(door shuts)

03:11.225 --> 03:13.458
â™ª

03:19.365 --> 03:21.800
(phone whooshes)

03:37.750 --> 03:40.452
(phone whooshes)

03:47.527 --> 03:49.995
(phone whooshes)

04:00.773 --> 04:03.508
(indistinct chatter)

04:03.510 --> 04:06.411
<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>Stop. The water's</i>
<i>for the fish.</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:09.414
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

04:12.518 --> 04:14.820
No. It needs to be grand.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.322
Uh-huh?
(sighs)
too peach.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.322
I don't pop in peach.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.757
I like it,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.427
But not for this.
Make me bedsheets out of it.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.430
When does the scene shoot?
Shooting? No, this is not
make-believe, roxanna.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.366
This is real life.
My daughter is coming.

04:27.368 --> 04:31.336
So I must prepare to step
into the role of...

04:31.338 --> 04:33.739
Father.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.546
(knocking)
oh, yeah?

04:56.829 --> 04:59.398
How you been, mike?
It's been a while, huh?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.533
Yeah. Um,
look, uh,

05:01.535 --> 05:03.769
This isn't...
It's not a good time right now.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.871
Ah. Got it. I'll be quick.
Uh, I need money.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.974
Like, um,
$2k should cover things.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.510
$2,000?
(scoffs)

05:11.512 --> 05:13.945
What-what do you think I do
for a living?
Aw, come on.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.415
I'm sure you've been saving.
You're the responsible brother,

05:16.417 --> 05:19.484
Yeah, maybe dip
into that big wedding fund.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.486
How is jane, anyway?

05:21.488 --> 05:24.056
You stay away from her.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.724
Look, I'm trying, man.

05:25.726 --> 05:29.594
But... $2,000
would probably help.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.064
Rafael:
<i>$10,000 cash right now</i>

05:32.066 --> 05:34.766
To move out of this
apartment while we deal
with the divorce settlement.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.601
Raf, stop.
(sighs)

05:36.603 --> 05:38.103
Look, I made a mistake.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.938
A mistake?
Yes.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.407
A mistake is
a parking ticket.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.776
You're not thinking clearly.
Latin lover narrator:
<i>In fact,</i>

05:44.778 --> 05:46.778
<i>Rafael was thinking</i>
<i>quite clearly.</i>

05:46.780 --> 05:49.414
I'm thinking about the fact
that you screwed my best friend.

05:49.416 --> 05:53.352
Well... Stop thinking
about that.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.921
Think about jane.
<i>See,</i>

05:55.923 --> 05:57.589
<i>That was part of the problem</i>
<i>as well.</i>

05:57.591 --> 05:59.624
<i>He had been thinking</i>
<i>about jane.</i>

05:59.626 --> 06:01.860
(moaning)
<i>or dreaming</i>

06:01.862 --> 06:03.428
<i>About her, I should say.</i>

06:03.430 --> 06:04.763
Raf,

06:04.765 --> 06:05.831
Think about the baby.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.832
Magda:
Good morning,

06:06.834 --> 06:08.400
You two.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.502
Good morning, magda.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.406
(quietly):
We'll talk later.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.675
(door shuts)

06:18.611 --> 06:20.445
Listen, can you do me a favor?

06:20.447 --> 06:21.580
Name it.
Cover my lunch?

06:21.582 --> 06:22.881
Can't do it.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.483
I'm seeing my father.
(gasps)

06:24.485 --> 06:27.619
Today? Oh, my
god. Of course.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.388
Thank you. I love you.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.056
I love you, too.
Man:
Sweet.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.624
Make-out time.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.959
(groans)

06:33.961 --> 06:35.627
You're disgusting, tom.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.764
<i>Hence his nickname...</i>

06:38.766 --> 06:40.599
Lina:
You do realize
her fiancÃ©'s

06:40.601 --> 06:42.934
The cop who's been
interviewing everyone.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.570
Cool. Look forward
to talking to him

06:45.572 --> 06:47.606
About all the blood splatters
I saw

06:47.608 --> 06:49.474
And how hot

06:49.476 --> 06:50.709
His fiancÃ©e is.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.745
(shudders)
(exhaling)

06:53.747 --> 06:55.447
Okay, don't forget lunch,
okay?

06:55.449 --> 06:56.982
You can be late to your shifts
but not mine.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.717
(phone chimes)
I won't forget.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.020
It's my sister.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.424
I have to call her.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.025
What are you doing here?

07:09.529 --> 07:12.731
Look, I wanted to apologize
for last night. You're right,

07:12.733 --> 07:15.734
Okay? My issues
with my brother

07:15.736 --> 07:18.670
Shouldn't keep you from being
honest with your best friend.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.705
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.575
Look, I think we should
just tell jane and michael
that we've been dating.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.609
(chuckles)

07:29.982 --> 07:32.217
Thanks, baby.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.622
Hi.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.191
I-I wanted to talk to you.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.526
<i>Well, that's not all he wanted</i>
<i>to do to her.</i>

07:41.528 --> 07:43.595
(moaning)

07:43.597 --> 07:44.830
It's about the-the baby.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.565
<i>If it seems rafael is nervous,</i>

07:46.567 --> 07:48.233
<i>It's only because he is.</i>

07:48.235 --> 07:50.001
What's going on?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.603
<i>Because he knows</i>
<i>what he's about to say</i>

07:51.605 --> 07:53.104
<i>May change jane's feelings</i>

07:53.106 --> 07:55.674
About what to do with the baby.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.009
Petra cheated on me
with my dead best friend,

07:58.011 --> 08:00.579
And our marriage isn't exactly
in the best place.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.481
What was that?

08:02.483 --> 08:03.782
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.617
And also
that no matter what happens,

08:05.619 --> 08:07.819
I still want to raise this baby.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.654
Just you?

08:09.656 --> 08:10.856
Alone?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.791
Yes.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.727
Sorry.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.862
I just...

08:16.864 --> 08:19.598
I don't know.
I...

08:19.600 --> 08:21.700
It's just not what I pictured.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.168
I know. Me neither.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.271
But I still think
it's the best option, and...

08:26.273 --> 08:28.106
Jane, I want this baby.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.108
And I know your fiancÃ© doesn't,

08:30.110 --> 08:32.143
So...
No, he changed his mind
about that, actually.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.678
Oh.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.582
But does that change
what you want?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.017
Because I hope
it doesn't.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.784
It might.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.220
I mean,
I...

08:42.222 --> 08:44.054
I just had this picture
in my head,

08:44.057 --> 08:46.057
This thing I didn't have,

08:46.059 --> 08:49.194
A two-parent,
happy, stable home.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.196
And now you're telling me
that that's

08:51.198 --> 08:53.798
Not gonna happen.
Look, no decisions
have been made yet. I mean,

08:53.800 --> 08:55.534
Petra wants to go to
therapy, and I might...
Okay.

08:55.536 --> 08:57.068
Well, then

08:57.070 --> 08:59.204
We both have things
to think about, I guess.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.974
Okay, so I'll see you later.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.310
Okay. See you later.

09:13.786 --> 09:15.320
And then he said the fact
that he's getting a divorce

09:15.322 --> 09:18.089
Shouldn't affect me.
The guy's an idiot.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.925
Babe, stop.
I mean, he is the father

09:19.927 --> 09:21.760
Of the child.
I know.
I'm sorry.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.695
But whatever you want to do,
if you want to keep the baby,

09:23.697 --> 09:25.797
We will. We got plenty of room.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.633
There's a walk-in closet.
It's huge.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.969
We're not putting the baby
in the closet.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.637
I was kidding.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.073
No, but, really,
what are my options?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.775
I m...
I can

09:36.777 --> 09:38.777
Let him raise it alone or...

09:38.779 --> 09:40.946
The three of us share custody?

09:40.948 --> 09:44.249
Which is just...
Hard and complicated.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.318
Yeah, it would be.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.919
I'll support
whatever you decide.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.154
Just let me know

09:49.156 --> 09:50.155
Which way
you're learning towards--

09:50.157 --> 09:51.323
Baby, no baby.

09:51.325 --> 09:52.123
No closet.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.224
No closet. Got it.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.160
(chuckles)

09:55.162 --> 09:57.128
But, michael...
Hmm?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.597
His wife

09:58.599 --> 10:00.665
And his best friend.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.167
Can you believe that?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.802
Latin lover narrator:
<i>He could believe it.</i>

10:03.804 --> 10:05.070
<i>Michael has known this</i>
<i>for a while,</i>

10:05.072 --> 10:07.672
<i>A fact he's kept hidden</i>
<i>from jane.</i>

10:07.674 --> 10:11.242
Yeah. It's-it's crazy.
It's crazy.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.777
But, come on,
you're gonna be late.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.746
Okay. Wait, where's my envelope?

10:14.748 --> 10:17.282
Here. What's in it?

10:17.284 --> 10:21.319
Just... Some baby
pictures and...

10:21.321 --> 10:23.822
This jimmy smits thing.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.292
Just in case I need
a spontaneous icebreaker.
Always good to plan

10:27.294 --> 10:29.661
Spontaneous icebreakers.
(chuckles)

10:29.663 --> 10:31.863
No, be serious.
I'm nervous, michael.

10:31.865 --> 10:35.133
I'm going to get to know my dad.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.768
Which is really great timing

10:36.770 --> 10:38.069
Because I'm not talking
to my mom.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.842
I just... Want it to go well.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.277
I just really want it
to look good, michelle.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.114
What do you think
we'll talk about?

10:49.116 --> 10:50.982
What shoes should I wear?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.084
He's gonna love you.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.954
She's gonna love me, right?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.722
How could anyone not?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.691
(softly giggles)

10:59.693 --> 11:02.727
But is it the second door
to the left?

11:02.729 --> 11:04.295
Sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.363
Sorry, sorry,
sorry I'm late.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.765
Sorry I'm late. Sorry.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.668
You must be jane.
My name is nicholas

11:09.670 --> 11:12.237
And I work for your
wonderful father.
Narrator: <i>It should be noted</i>

11:12.239 --> 11:15.040
<i>That nicholas</i>
<i>had been prepared by rogelio.</i>

11:15.042 --> 11:16.841
<i>He was also told to bow.</i>

11:17.810 --> 11:19.878
Come. Follow me.

11:29.922 --> 11:32.791
Rogelio.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.092
Jane's here.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.860
Rogelio:
Jane?

11:36.829 --> 11:38.129
Where is he?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.767
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Understand that</i>

11:42.769 --> 11:44.402
<i>Rogelio had dreamed</i>
<i>of this moment</i>

11:44.404 --> 11:47.405
<i>Since he'd learned</i>
<i>he had a daughter.</i>

11:47.407 --> 11:50.075
<i>He wanted to make</i>
<i>a grand entrance.</i>

11:52.144 --> 11:55.180
<i>One his daughter</i>
<i>would never forget.</i>

11:56.482 --> 11:59.718
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

11:59.720 --> 12:02.921
<i>This was maybe</i>
<i>a little too grand.</i>

12:12.865 --> 12:14.933
Hi, jane.
It's good to see you again.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.835
Hi, rogelio.
Call me dad.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.236
I think, rogelio, for now.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.171
Okay, we'll go with
rogelio for now.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.439
May I hug you?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.875
Yes. Oh.
Now.

12:23.877 --> 12:26.878
(soft grunt)
(applause, whistling)

12:26.880 --> 12:28.947
All the records, meaning what?
Time cards punched,

12:28.949 --> 12:31.516
Any hr incidents, tipping
percentages, I don't care.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.418
We need everything
you have on any employee

12:33.420 --> 12:35.754
That was working
the night of the murder.
Got it.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.756
Does that mean you think
one of my employees killed him?

12:37.758 --> 12:38.823
We didn't say that.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.792
Well, what can you say?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.260
To you? At the moment...

12:42.262 --> 12:43.962
Nothing.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.230
Well... I mean, it has to be.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.932
Otherwise, what is this
really about, detective?

12:47.934 --> 12:49.534
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Well, actually, this is</i>

12:49.536 --> 12:51.302
<i>A really tricky question.</i>

12:51.304 --> 12:54.305
<i>On the surface, this is about</i>
<i>the fact that a bellboy</i>

12:54.307 --> 12:56.241
<i>Might connect</i>
<i>roman zazo's murder</i>

12:56.243 --> 12:58.910
<i>To sin rostro, the notorious</i>
<i>drug dealer known as</i>

12:58.912 --> 13:01.412
<i>The man without a face.</i>

13:01.414 --> 13:03.982
<i>But underneath,</i>
<i>their tension was actually</i>

13:03.984 --> 13:06.818
<i>About jane. The woman</i>
<i>with the beautiful face.</i>

13:06.820 --> 13:08.019
Again.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.888
This is official
police business.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.256
We really can't talk about it.

13:12.892 --> 13:13.291
I'll get you the records.

13:18.063 --> 13:20.832
So what? Suddenly
you want the kid?

13:20.834 --> 13:23.201
I want what jane wants.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.869
Got it.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.838
But sorry to hear
about your marriage, man.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.239
(chuckles)

13:28.241 --> 13:30.975
Tough break.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.411
Jane:
<i>Honestly?</i>

13:33.413 --> 13:36.881
I can't believe my mom
kept you from me for so long.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.216
Yeah, I know.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.984
It is a crime.
Mm.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.287
In many ways,
a hate crime.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.391
I guess we're just gonna have
to make up for lost time.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.160
Yeah.
I'm moving out
of the house.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.596
I know this is a lot to ask,

13:51.598 --> 13:53.598
But I was wondering
if there was any way...

13:53.600 --> 13:54.866
You could stay with me?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.868
I would love nothing more.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.938
Great. 'cause I really
hate my mom these days.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.940
You see? We have
something in common, then.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.476
(laughs) oh, oh,
that reminds me.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.312
I made this doll of her.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.080
Do you want to
stick pins in it?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.949
No.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.417
We should set it aflame.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.985
(giggles)

14:13.987 --> 14:17.355
(cackling)

14:17.357 --> 14:19.524
Xiomara:
And they'll sit there and laugh

14:19.526 --> 14:21.392
And watch as I explode.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.899
Maybe not exactly
like that, fine.

14:33.005 --> 14:34.038
Yeah, and she hates me.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.222
Latin lover narrator:
<i>This was good advice, because</i>

14:51.224 --> 14:54.592
<i>There's no way xiomara</i>
<i>could imagine their meeting.</i>

14:58.530 --> 15:02.166
(sighs)

15:02.168 --> 15:04.135
No, thank you.
Please, have some.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.204
I'm pregnant, so...
Right, yeah, of course.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.973
I'm sorry.
I will have some, nick.

15:08.975 --> 15:11.009
Latin lover narrator:
It should be noted that rogelio

15:11.011 --> 15:14.012
<i>Always liked a glass of wine</i>
<i>when he was nervous.</i>

15:14.014 --> 15:15.580
More. Nice.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.081
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And he was very nervous.</i>

15:17.083 --> 15:19.951
To my daughter,
jane gloria villanueva.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.587
Gloriana. Jane gloriana.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.656
To you.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.263
Ah.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.032
So how do you like the set?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.334
I had the crew work
on it around the clock.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.637
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
It was no trouble. Actually,
I didn't move a finger.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.041
So, um, where are we, exactly?

15:43.043 --> 15:45.410
ChichÃ©n itzÃ¡. Mayan temple.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.312
It's a quick fly
from mexico city.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.047
So this must mean
something to you.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.349
Indeed, it does.
Tell me.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.652
Well, as a younger man,
at a very low point in my life,

15:54.654 --> 15:56.688
I climbed to the top
of the temple

15:56.690 --> 15:58.456
And I prayed.
It was

15:58.458 --> 16:00.591
A very spiritual
moment for me.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.061
Wow.
What did you pray for?

16:03.063 --> 16:06.230
Great fame.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.101
Jane, I'm sure you must have
many questions about me.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.603
Yes, I do, I...
And the best way
to get those answers

16:12.605 --> 16:14.172
Is by reading this.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.278
It says
unauthorized biography,

16:20.280 --> 16:24.115
But, actually, one of my many
publicists wrote it.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.451
Thank you.

16:26.453 --> 16:28.353
You're welcome.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.254
Now, tell me everything
about yourself.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.156
I wonder what we have
in common.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.725
Clearly, we have
nothing in common.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.160
He's shallow and vain and

16:36.162 --> 16:37.462
Not what I imagined him to be.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.163
I'm freaking out
about this.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.432
I... I just need
to talk to my...

16:41.434 --> 16:43.134
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

16:43.136 --> 16:45.303
<i>She was about to say</i>
<i>her mother.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:48.039
You could
call her, janie.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.174
No.

16:56.081 --> 16:57.582
Okay.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.118
I'll be your mom.
First thing you say.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.190
What do I do?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.291
You should...

17:08.294 --> 17:09.794
Give him another try.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.163
And he's probably
just really nervous.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.700
Maybe see him again
but on your turf.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.300
Away from the
mexican ruins.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.669
(chuckles)

17:18.671 --> 17:20.171
Let's have him
over for dinner,

17:20.173 --> 17:22.240
Something casual,
low-key.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.242
That sounds perfect.

17:25.244 --> 17:28.212
No. Perfect is tacos,

17:28.214 --> 17:32.083
Beer, espn, you wearing
nothing but my ronaldo jersey.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.719
Yeah, I think that'd be
a little weird for my dad.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.422
Maybe I can cook for him.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.589
Since when do you cook?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.691
I'm an honors student, michael.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.593
I can follow a recipe.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.196
And I'll get a good one
from my grandma.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.231
Why is it so messy in here?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.068
Oh, sorry, it's
paperwork.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.070
Mm.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.072
Hey, why is my name
on this list?

17:54.074 --> 17:57.141
(gasps)
am I a suspect for something?

17:57.143 --> 17:58.443
It's the list of the
people working the hotel

17:58.445 --> 18:00.144
The night of the murder.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.213
Well, it isn't right,
because I know one bellboy

18:02.215 --> 18:04.515
That was definitely working
and not on here.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.350
Disgusting tom.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.653
Oh, my god. (gasps)

18:08.655 --> 18:10.421
That's a clue, right?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.290
Easy, veronica mars.
(giggles)

18:12.292 --> 18:14.192
It's just an oversight.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.694
You trade shifts with people all
the time and don't tell anyone.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.530
But I will let you know
when you cracked the case.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.232
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I just did, babe.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.134
(laughs)

18:23.136 --> 18:25.169
How difficult is it
not to get caught cheating?

18:25.171 --> 18:27.205
Blaming me won't help,
mother.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.507
Petra, you promised.
After what happened,

18:29.509 --> 18:31.142
You said you would
always take care of me.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.244
I know, I know,
and I will.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.646
(sighs) I think I got through
to him. A little bit.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.149
He wants
that child.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.385
Petra.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.521
He must also want you.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.792
Darling. Your skin is so dry.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.327
You must take
care of that.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.231
Your beauty is your weapon.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.235
One of your weapons.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.303
You understand what I'm saying?

19:19.658 --> 19:21.425
Jane?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.163
(sighs)
you're supposed to be
at dance class.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.398
You think I can dance when my
daughter won't speak to me?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.501
I just came for a recipe.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.271
How was your meeting
with your father?

19:33.273 --> 19:35.406
How do you think it was?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.675
We're strangers. I don't
know anything about him

19:37.677 --> 19:39.377
And he doesn't know
anything about me.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.479
I'm sorry, jane.
Yeah.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.414
You know, you keep
saying that,

19:43.416 --> 19:45.483
But it's hard to get
to the "it's okay" part.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.419
Because it's not okay.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.488
What you did to me--
what you took away from me--

19:50.490 --> 19:52.390
It's not okay.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.626
And I just don't understand
how you could've done it.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.562
Because you're not
a mother yet.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.364
You know,

20:00.366 --> 20:01.866
When you were little,

20:01.868 --> 20:03.501
We'd go to the park

20:03.503 --> 20:05.636
And there'd be
all these moms there,

20:05.638 --> 20:08.206
Talking about their kids
and how great they were.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.409
And I remember thinking
they were crazy.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.812
Because it was so obvious
that I got the best one.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.481
I loved you so much,

20:17.483 --> 20:19.283
And I just got scared.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.618
Of what?

20:20.620 --> 20:23.554
I don't know.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.457
What if he came and made
some kind of claim on you?

20:26.459 --> 20:29.327
What if he wanted
to make plans,

20:29.329 --> 20:31.562
What if he wanted
to take you away?

20:31.564 --> 20:34.265
It was easier to pretend
that he didn't exist.

20:34.267 --> 20:37.401
Easier for you.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.403
But now I have
this man in my life--

20:39.405 --> 20:41.706
My father-- and I don't even
have a relationship with him.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.376
And that's not easy, mom.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.445
I know it's not,
and I'm sorry.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.814
And you don't
have to say

20:49.816 --> 20:52.583
It's okay, now, I know,
it's not, but...

20:54.419 --> 20:56.554
...We're gonna get
through this eventually,

20:56.556 --> 20:58.256
Right?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.925
I don't know.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.994
I really don't know.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.904
Woman:
We have five plastic surgery
recovery suites now.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.474
If we expand into the new site,
we could have as many as 20.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.443
But hospital grade, as
we did with the others.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.812
And carry through...
Michael: Excuse me.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.648
Latin lover narrator:
<i>As you might have noticed,</i>

21:23.650 --> 21:25.783
<i>When rafael and michael speak,</i>

21:25.785 --> 21:28.586
<i>It's often more about</i>
<i>what is unspoken than spoken.</i>

21:28.588 --> 21:32.790
What can I do for you,
detective cordero?

21:32.792 --> 21:35.326
Can we talk to you
for a sec?

21:35.328 --> 21:37.295
Apparently, there were
some names missing

21:37.297 --> 21:38.863
From that employee list
you gave us?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.465
We want to make sure
it's just an oversight.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.834
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.504
I know at least one bellboy
who worked that night

21:46.506 --> 21:47.872
That wasn't on the list.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.374
Anything I can do to help.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.343
We need information on him.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.679
No problem.
Great.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.647
(elevator bell dings)

21:56.649 --> 21:59.350
Okay, I need to
tell you something.
Mm-hmm.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.719
At first you're gonna
be a little mad,

22:01.721 --> 22:04.455
But then you're gonna
realize it's okay.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.956
Oh, yeah? Is that
what's gonna happen?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.526
I hope.
What is it?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.528
Well, you know I've been
seeing this guy, right?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.830
Mm-hmm.
It's billy.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.766
Michael's brother, billy.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.501
What?

22:17.503 --> 22:18.769
I know.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.772
For how long?
Like, six weeks.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.075
What?! At my engagement party?

22:24.077 --> 22:25.476
We had sex in michael's
bathroom. Yeah.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.411
Lina!
I know!

22:27.413 --> 22:28.946
Michael and his brother--
they don't get along.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.715
He doesn't even like
to talk about him.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.049
And that's why billy wanted
to keep it

22:32.051 --> 22:33.484
On the down-low,
because if it went away,

22:33.486 --> 22:35.052
It went away.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.388
But at this point,
we want you to know.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.724
I mean, what if he's using you
to piss off michael?

22:39.726 --> 22:42.493
Okay, first of
all, thanks.
Well, no. Come on.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.129
I didn't mean it like that. You
know I didn't mean it like that.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.064
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.767
And michael says that
he's been in a lot of trouble.

22:49.769 --> 22:52.436
I know, and he's been
honest with me about it,

22:52.438 --> 22:54.805
But he's changed.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.608
Just ask michael to
give him a chance.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.650
(sighs)

23:08.687 --> 23:10.588
Rafael?

23:12.824 --> 23:14.425
Petra, I'm...

23:14.427 --> 23:16.894
Look what I found.

23:20.031 --> 23:21.499
You kept the frisbee?

23:21.501 --> 23:24.068
Of course I kept it.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.704
Rafael:
A frisbee, maybe,
but not a hat.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.439
Of course it's a hat.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.107
How big is our kid's head
going to be?

23:30.109 --> 23:32.676
I know. It's
awful, okay?

23:32.678 --> 23:34.945
You see, I'm really not
prepared to be a mom.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.680
Stop.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.182
You're gonna be great.

23:38.184 --> 23:41.118
(sighs)
come here.

23:43.188 --> 23:46.457
And our kid will grow
into the frisbee.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.992
(laughs)

23:50.595 --> 23:53.097
God, the service
in this place is terrible.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.466
How long does it take
to get a margarita?

23:55.468 --> 23:56.901
Yeah.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.470
Beautiful location, though.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.872
It definitely
has potential.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.974
What, as in a place
to invest in?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.977
I mean, it needs
a huge remodel.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.979
And I'd have
to empty my trust fund,

24:08.981 --> 24:10.548
Which would be
a huge undertaking.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.049
I'd be risking a lot.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.051
Well, I think you should do it.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.821
I believe in you.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.689
We were so happy.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.658
And then we
had all the...

24:20.660 --> 24:24.495
Well... Bad luck.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.731
The miscarriage, cancer.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.236
But we can get back
to what we had.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.072
I wish it was that easy.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.574
But it can be.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.677
We have the best reason
of all to stay together.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.745
A baby.

24:41.747 --> 24:45.015
And I know how much
you want that.

24:45.017 --> 24:49.053
And I know how
much I want you.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.172
Just calm down, baby.
You don't understand. Billy's
only dating lina to piss me off.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.740
Yeah, I told her that,
and got to be honest,

25:09.742 --> 25:11.075
Didn't really go over great.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.676
Well, that's what's happening.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.278
He thinks that the closer
he gets to you,

25:14.280 --> 25:15.913
The more uncomfortable I'll get,
and I'll give him money.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.147
That's what he wants.
It's what he always wants.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.582
$2,000, he asked me
this time.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.718
What?!
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?

25:20.720 --> 25:22.620
Because I said no,
because I'm saving for us,

25:22.622 --> 25:24.288
Our future.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.956
And he knows I don't want him
hanging around you,

25:25.958 --> 25:28.125
So he's hanging with lina
to get under my skin.

25:28.127 --> 25:29.660
Well, don't let him get
under your skin,

25:29.662 --> 25:30.928
Because I can handle myself
with your brother.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.663
Jane, you don't understand.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.232
Okay. Well, just
tell me then, michael.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.571
Look, you know
I was a bad kid.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.872
We talked about this.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.974
And I don't need him
telling you stories.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.809
Okay. Is there
a story in particular

25:45.811 --> 25:47.711
You don't want him
telling me about?

25:47.713 --> 25:49.213
We used to do
stupid things.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.948
What kind of stupid things?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.683
Mostly...

25:52.685 --> 25:55.052
Stealing cars and
selling the parts.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.621
Oh, so, like, <i>illegal</i>
<i>stupid things.</i>

25:57.623 --> 25:59.323
Yeah.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.225
We worked out of
this old garage.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.726
The cops found it.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.262
He was only 16,
no record.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.765
I already was in trouble.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.199
Billy took the blame.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.201
What?!
I tried to come forward,

26:11.203 --> 26:14.772
But our-our lawyer said that if
I did, he'd still be in jail

26:14.774 --> 26:16.206
For lying.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.641
Oh, my god.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.777
Yeah.

26:19.779 --> 26:23.213
After that, I-I...
I turned my life around.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.249
He went the other way.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.618
And I've been bailing
him out ever since.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.054
(sighs heavily)

26:30.056 --> 26:33.157
I wish you'd told me about this
a while ago, you know?

26:33.159 --> 26:35.693
I should have.

26:35.695 --> 26:38.295
But it's not something
I'm-I'm proud of, so...

26:38.297 --> 26:40.731
You don't have
to be proud with me.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.299
Just honest.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.802
I can handle this stuff.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.071
Just be honest with me,
okay, michael?

26:47.073 --> 26:51.742
Especially now with my mom lying
and everything that's happened.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.677
I just need it.

26:53.679 --> 26:56.113
Yeah, I know.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.749
I'm sorry.

27:01.853 --> 27:04.855
I'm sorry to just
barge in like this,

27:04.857 --> 27:07.391
But I didn't know
if you would want to see me.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.360
I really screwed things up
with jane, xiomara.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.762
Oh, no. What happened?

27:11.764 --> 27:14.765
(man speaking spanish on tv)

27:16.935 --> 27:18.369
Oh, I'll turn that off.

27:18.371 --> 27:20.104
No. No, please.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.772
It relaxes me.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.707
Xiomara:
Rogelio?

27:23.709 --> 27:24.842
Yes. What?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.343
And it was terrible, xiomara.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.078
When I am nervous, I talk,

27:28.080 --> 27:29.813
And I was so nervous.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.949
Everything you told me
about her--

27:31.951 --> 27:35.119
How smart she was, and how she's
going to be a teacher, and...

27:35.121 --> 27:37.187
You know, I never
did well in school,

27:37.189 --> 27:39.089
So, maybe I overcompensated
a little.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.125
The mayan ruins?

27:41.127 --> 27:42.760
It was actually quite beautiful,

27:42.762 --> 27:45.362
But, yes, in retrospect,
a little over the top.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.365
Right. See, the thing is,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.367
Jane's not impressed
with money or power.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.237
She likes going to the
movies or shopping at target.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.839
That kind of thing,
low-key stuff.
I see.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.441
I just want
to get it right with her.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.376
And, anyway,
she reached out again

27:59.378 --> 28:01.412
And invited me
for dinner tonight.

28:01.414 --> 28:05.049
So, I thought, you know,
maybe you could come

28:05.051 --> 28:07.184
To help make things
less awkward.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.054
Oh. I would, but...

28:10.056 --> 28:13.190
Jane and I--

28:13.192 --> 28:16.460
Well, we're not exactly on
the greatest of terms right now.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.462
Because of me?

28:18.464 --> 28:21.365
No. Because of me.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.300
(sighs)

28:23.302 --> 28:26.470
The last thing I wanted was
to affect your relationship.

28:26.472 --> 28:31.041
I know, and you've been
surprisingly... Understanding.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.744
She's just having a
hard time with it, which

28:33.746 --> 28:35.079
I also understand.

28:37.015 --> 28:39.483
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.952
This is so
embarrassing.

28:47.859 --> 28:50.260
(sighs)

28:50.262 --> 28:52.763
You'll be fine.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.998
Just be yourself.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.401
Jane just wants
to get to know you.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.770
She wants to show you
baby pictures,

28:59.772 --> 29:03.006
Normal stuff like that.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.512
Okay, so, I tried to make
one of my grandma's recipes,

29:08.514 --> 29:10.914
But michael is
right. I can't cook.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.283
But in your unauthorized bio
it says

29:13.285 --> 29:15.185
That you were fond
of takeout thai.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.788
Oh, and sake bombs, it said.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.790
Yes.
(laughs)

29:19.792 --> 29:21.291
No, I-I-I... No,
I think I'll-I'll...

29:21.293 --> 29:22.826
I will pass at the moment.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.495
(laughs)
okay.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.863
Latin lover narrator:
<i>In fact, things seemed</i>

29:25.865 --> 29:27.131
<i>To be going surprisingly well.</i>

29:27.133 --> 29:29.333
Should we get started?
Let's.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.034
Actually, there is something
I did want to talk to you about.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.469
Hmm?
It's about your mom.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.004
Michael:
Pad thai.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.939
Well, hello.
What about her?

29:35.941 --> 29:38.442
You have to understand
that she was not wrong.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.811
Excuse me?
When I was 17,

29:40.813 --> 29:42.913
I was an idiot-- kicked out
of school, smoking weed.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.515
She wanted
to protect you.
Look.

29:44.517 --> 29:45.849
I think it's really nice
that you want to defend her,

29:45.851 --> 29:47.351
But I don't want to
talk about it, okay?

29:47.353 --> 29:50.187
Mm.
Right, that's between
me and my mom.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.356
So, how did you get
into telenovelas?

29:52.358 --> 29:54.391
Jane, well, she was terrible,
but she was scared.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.460
Rogelio, come on.
I just want you
to see her side.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.195
I know her side.
She was crying, jane.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.830
And you don't think
that I've cried?

29:59.832 --> 30:01.231
But you wouldn't
know that because

30:01.233 --> 30:03.867
You don't know
anything about me,

30:03.869 --> 30:05.135
Not even my
middle name.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.937
And that's because of her.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.238
And I guess for you,
it is easy to forgive that

30:08.240 --> 30:09.873
Because you've only know
about me for 16 months.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.341
But I have thought about you
every single day

30:11.343 --> 30:14.044
For the past 23 years.

30:15.180 --> 30:16.547
You know what?

30:16.549 --> 30:19.183
I'm-I'm sorry, I can't do this.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.186
Rogelio, you seem like
a nice enough man,

30:22.188 --> 30:24.087
But we haven't been a
part of each other's lives

30:24.089 --> 30:27.157
Until now, and we've been fine,
so let's not force it.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.206
(sighs)

30:42.208 --> 30:43.874
(sighs)

30:43.876 --> 30:46.977
So... Your dad left.

30:46.979 --> 30:49.179
I made him a little to-go box.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.882
Extra cashew chicken,
for future reference.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.017
Thanks.

30:54.019 --> 30:56.220
It's funny.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.288
I kept telling
myself going in,

30:58.290 --> 31:01.458
"no expectations,
no expectations."

31:01.460 --> 31:06.029
It's impossible not
to have expectations.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.966
What were they?

31:08.968 --> 31:12.035
You know, the fantasy.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.973
Someone I could connect
with immediately,

31:15.975 --> 31:20.043
Someone who I can see
myself in, who gets me.

31:20.045 --> 31:24.448
Maybe someone who can help me
figure out what to do right now.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.017
About the baby?

31:27.019 --> 31:28.485
Yeah.

31:28.487 --> 31:32.489
Rafael as a single father
is not what I pictured.

31:32.491 --> 31:36.960
And I didn't picture
us raising it with him.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.563
There's no perfect answer.

31:39.565 --> 31:43.300
But I'm in it with you,
remember?

31:44.969 --> 31:46.904
(sighs)

31:46.906 --> 31:48.538
I know.

31:48.540 --> 31:52.175
And I wouldn't be able
to do it without you.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.487
I don't want to fight anymore.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.190
Neither do I.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.363
These are the divorce papers.

32:18.136 --> 32:20.437
You were about to have
sex with me yesterday.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.106
We stopped.
Yes. But I could tell
you didn't want to.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.609
Petra, please, let's keep what
little dignity we have left.

32:25.611 --> 32:28.178
Jane's going to change her mind.
You're going to have to share
custody of that baby.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.613
I'm hoping I won't.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.448
You will. You know you will.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.084
Rafael, we can work it out.

32:34.086 --> 32:37.120
Not if I don't love you anymore.

32:39.991 --> 32:42.359
You make me sick.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.695
I understand.

32:44.697 --> 32:48.131
So sign the divorce papers.
You'll get your $250,000

32:48.133 --> 32:49.700
And we'll be done
with each other.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.113
Hi.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.515
What are you doing here?

33:05.517 --> 33:08.085
I heard what you said
about not forcing things.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.087
This is not forcing things.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.156
This is... Apologizing.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.058
I think I was
trying to make up

33:15.060 --> 33:17.294
For all these years
in two hours.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.296
(sighs)

33:19.298 --> 33:20.998
I was trying to impress you.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.067
But I went
too far, so...

33:24.069 --> 33:25.302
I'm sorry.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.171
No. It's okay.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.240
I think I was hard on you,

33:30.242 --> 33:32.242
And I had expectations
that were...

33:32.244 --> 33:34.244
Totally unreasonable.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.413
Then let's begin again.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.748
Can we?

33:37.750 --> 33:39.082
Mm-hmm.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.650
Good.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.419
Your mother told me you
brought baby pictures,

33:42.421 --> 33:44.287
So I brought you
one as well.

33:47.558 --> 33:50.193
To celebrate our relationship.

33:54.432 --> 33:57.434
I-I don't know what to say.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.403
Say nothing. It's yours to keep.

33:59.405 --> 34:03.173
I was also thinking
about what you said, how...

34:03.175 --> 34:05.675
We haven't been a part of each
other's life for 23 years.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.145
And that's true.

34:08.147 --> 34:11.181
But I didn't know about you
all that time.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.083
But...

34:13.085 --> 34:14.717
Now that I know,

34:14.719 --> 34:18.487
I'm not walking away from you,
jane gloriana villanueva.

34:18.489 --> 34:21.190
Even if it's not perfect.

34:21.193 --> 34:24.161
Nothing's perfect.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.163
Perfect is a fantasy.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.197
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in this moment,</i>

34:28.199 --> 34:30.199
<i>Jane realized</i>
<i>she had something in common</i>

34:30.202 --> 34:34.204
<i>With her father after all.</i>

34:34.206 --> 34:35.605
I can't walk away
from this baby.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.107
And I know that's not
what you want to hear,

34:37.109 --> 34:38.708
But that's where I'm at.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.143
Whether you stay with
petra or get a divorce...

34:41.146 --> 34:42.212
We're divorcing.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.246
I'm sorry.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.449
But, regardless,
I can't walk away.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.119
And I wanted
to be honest with you

34:49.121 --> 34:50.719
Because you were honest with me.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.290
And you're okay with this?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.461
I am.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.229
Absolutely.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.630
So, what,

35:00.632 --> 35:03.633
I'm gonna get my kid
on weekends?

35:03.635 --> 35:05.669
'cause I'll fight for more time.

35:05.671 --> 35:07.270
We'll have
to work out custody.

35:07.272 --> 35:08.538
It's not gonna be easy.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.340
I know.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.275
But nothing is
and nothing's perfect.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.612
We'll just have to make it work.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.314
Absolutely.

35:17.316 --> 35:18.815
Together.

35:18.817 --> 35:20.817
We'll figure
this out.

35:20.819 --> 35:23.286
Okay.

35:24.322 --> 35:26.890
Are you okay?

35:26.892 --> 35:28.725
Not really.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.160
I'm freaking out.

35:30.162 --> 35:33.630
Well, just know
that I am freaking out with you.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.233
I do.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.901
Thank you, michael.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.876
And when you get home,
be prepared for tacos, beer

35:45.878 --> 35:48.178
And me in your ronaldo jersey.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.246
(elevator bell dings)
yes.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.447
(chuckles)

35:51.415 --> 35:53.917
(exhales)

35:56.187 --> 35:58.622
(phone chimes)

36:05.463 --> 36:09.900
<i>And now I must draw your</i>
<i>attention back to jane's plan.</i>

36:09.902 --> 36:13.170
<i>The one that involved tacos.</i>

36:13.905 --> 36:15.572
<i>Beer.</i>

36:15.574 --> 36:18.808
<i>And her in a ronaldo jersey.</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:20.410
<i>The only problem?</i>

36:20.412 --> 36:22.479
She could not find that jersey.

36:24.783 --> 36:28.485
I can get you the number
of a few custody lawyers I know.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.353
Thanks.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.422
This whole thing
is just messed up.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.257
(sighs)

36:35.593 --> 36:37.327
A guy I can't stand
is gonna be involved

36:37.329 --> 36:40.597
In raising my kid.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.366
I just don't know
what jane's doing with him.

36:45.836 --> 36:48.338
Rafael, do you have
feelings for her?

36:48.340 --> 36:50.340
It's... Complicated.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.309
<i>Not that complicated.</i>

36:52.311 --> 36:53.410
<i>He liked her.</i>

36:57.782 --> 36:59.616
(screaming)

37:04.522 --> 37:06.590
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.592
Oh, my god.
<i>But, alas,</i>

37:08.594 --> 37:11.595
<i>Dead bellboys tell no tales.</i>

37:11.597 --> 37:12.662
Who did this?
(gasps)

37:13.898 --> 37:16.333
S-sin...

37:16.335 --> 37:18.335
Rostro.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.537
<i>Anymore.</i>

37:25.476 --> 37:27.911
I'm sorry, mother.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.646
I really thought
it was going to work out.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.281
I know you
did, darling.

37:31.283 --> 37:33.917
But, eh...

37:33.919 --> 37:35.752
It's done.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.455
No use worrying.
You'll just ruin your skin.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.992
Come. Sit.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.861
Let's moisturize.
We'll come up with a plan.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.302
(grunts)
<i>ooh.</i>

37:52.304 --> 37:55.405
<i>Moisturizer's not going</i>
<i>to help that.</i>

38:01.979 --> 38:03.346
But I don't understand.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.348
What is sin rostro?

38:05.350 --> 38:09.552
Not what, who.
He's a big drug kingpin

38:09.554 --> 38:11.888
Who disappeared for a few years
and recently resurfaced.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.523
Connected to my hotel?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.525
Well, your friend roman zazo
seemed to have had

38:15.527 --> 38:17.360
Some sort of relationship
with him.

38:17.362 --> 38:18.895
Wait, why am I just now
hearing about this?

38:18.897 --> 38:20.830
We couldn't compromise
the investigation.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.666
Zazo
was waiting

38:22.668 --> 38:26.336
To be contacted by sin rostro
just before he died.

38:26.338 --> 38:29.005
Wait, there have been
two murders now.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.408
In my hotel.
Nadine:
And we want to prevent

38:31.410 --> 38:32.776
Any more.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.045
Which is why all of this
needs to stay in this room.

38:35.047 --> 38:37.681
No one can know
what the bellboy said.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.683
No one breathes
the words "sin rostro."

38:39.685 --> 38:41.818
Do you understand?

38:47.458 --> 38:48.758
Jane.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.761
What's going on?

38:56.534 --> 38:57.934
Jane...

38:57.936 --> 38:59.769
You knew.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.604
All this time,

39:01.606 --> 39:04.974
You knew and you didn't tell me.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.678
I didn't want to compromise
the investigation.
Oh, please.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.013
Who was I gonna tell?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.681
It's complicated.
No, it's not.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.483
You lied to me.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.518
You stood there this morning
when I was telling you

39:15.520 --> 39:17.520
That petra cheated on rafael
with his best friend

39:17.522 --> 39:19.689
And you pretended
to be surprised.
I know.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.859
I-I felt... I feel terrible.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.661
Are you kidding me?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.896
(sighs)

39:26.898 --> 39:28.732
I didn't tell you
about the affair

39:28.734 --> 39:31.468
Because when I found out you
were pregnant, I freaked out.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.537
I didn't want the baby.
But I changed my mind.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.005
You know this.
I changed my mind.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.674
You would've let me give
that baby

39:37.676 --> 39:39.809
To a couple
who may have been totally wrong.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.812
I made a mistake.
Yes, I made a mistake.
A mistake?

39:42.814 --> 39:45.682
Wait. Jane. Jane.
Please. Please.
I got to go.

39:45.684 --> 39:47.617
Let go of me.
I'm sorry.

39:49.553 --> 39:53.390
Look, I screwed up.

39:53.392 --> 39:56.693
I was scared, I was stupid.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.596
But everything I did,
I did because I love you.

39:59.598 --> 40:02.599
Jane.

40:02.601 --> 40:03.900
D-don't leave.

40:06.837 --> 40:09.506
â™ª

40:22.621 --> 40:24.621

<i>Betrayed by the man</i>

<i>She needed her mother.</i>

40:35.466 --> 40:37.934
Honey.

(shuddering breath)

40:54.618 --> 40:57.053
(shuddering breaths)

41:05.996 --> 41:07.997
You could
have warned me.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.533
You would have said no.

41:10.535 --> 41:13.536
And it was the only way
to break that prenup.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.971
Man:
Mrs. Solano,

41:14.973 --> 41:16.873
You sure you're feeling okay?
Yes,

41:16.875 --> 41:18.975
Much better. Thank you.
Good.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.777
So, can you tell me
how this happened?

41:23.581 --> 41:25.648
My husband did it.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.051
And I'd like to file
a police report.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.752
<i>It's true.</i>

41:29.754 --> 41:31.754
<i>Sometimes you really do need</i>
<i>your mother.</i>
