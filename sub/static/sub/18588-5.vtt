WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:04.999
Anyway, they said
that he could whistle

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
in three octaves.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.440
He died whistling.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.760
And when they opened him up
at the postmortem,

00:12.800 --> 00:14.520
the last three notes came out.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.079
Did they recognise the tune?

00:19.080 --> 00:21.240
Well, the pathologist said

00:21.280 --> 00:23.880
it sounded like acute cardiac
Moon River.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.520
I thought he died of old age.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.760
Yeah, well, there was that, too.
Mm-hm.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.200
Hey, you want something else
to think about? Hmm?

00:34.240 --> 00:35.719
The guy at the Post Office said

00:35.720 --> 00:38.680
there's a load of forged banknotes
knocking about. Huh?

00:38.720 --> 00:41.959
How do you tell?
And why has Granville gone white?

00:41.960 --> 00:44.000
Hardly detectable.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.600
Except by experts.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.039
Oh!

00:47.040 --> 00:49.280
Oh...
HORN PARPS

00:49.320 --> 00:50.720
Agh! Agh! Oh!

00:52.320 --> 00:54.360
HE PANTS
Oh! We need a van.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.880
I mean, this is humiliating
at my age.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.479
I should be mobile.
I see me in aviator sunglasses,

01:01.480 --> 01:06.279
reclining on leather upholstery,
room inside for selected customers.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.960
Don't pressure your father
while he's hyperventilating.

01:10.800 --> 01:14.719
What's wrong? His money belt's
just developed a murmur.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.159
It's all right,
I'll be all right in a minute.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.679
It's just everything went,
like, a funny colour.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.000
Especially around the bit that says,
"I promise to pay the bearer." Ooh!

01:41.080 --> 01:43.480
LOCKS CLICK

01:43.520 --> 01:45.000
HE SIGHS

02:06.520 --> 02:08.479
Don't you go snapping at me!

02:08.520 --> 02:11.279
You save that for any forged notes.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.000
If any slip past me,
I want you spitting them out.

02:18.080 --> 02:22.119
We need a vehicle. You can take
that off, I get the message.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.840
Does that mean we'll get a vehicle?
No, it means I get the message.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.400
I can't keep borrowing one.
We've got to get our own.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.240
You've got to get me off
that shop bike.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.680
Look at me, I'm saddle sore!

02:33.720 --> 02:35.479
Doesn't show.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.679
I'm walking bow-legged!

02:37.680 --> 02:40.800
Large, friendly dogs
could walk straight through!

02:40.840 --> 02:44.720
And what unfriendly dogs could do,
I shudder to think.

02:44.760 --> 02:49.200
Anyway, we manage perfectly well
without a vehicle.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.759
While all the time,
I'm offering my nether regions

02:51.760 --> 02:53.599
as a hostage to fortune!

02:53.600 --> 02:55.280
Just like your mother.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.840
And you said last year
you'd think about it.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.119
Well, I AM thinking about it.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.320
Well, while you're at it,

03:03.360 --> 03:05.760
think about that big
wheel of cheese you bought.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.400
Still in there,
stinking out the warehouse.

03:08.440 --> 03:11.599
Releasing its noble flavour.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.519
They don't like it,
they all say it's too hard.

03:14.520 --> 03:15.799
BELL RINGS

03:15.800 --> 03:17.320
Oh...

03:17.360 --> 03:21.520
Ah, Madge's boyfriend. Ha-ha!
How are you today, Gastric?

03:21.560 --> 03:25.600
She sees me, she goes, "Eugh!"

03:26.840 --> 03:30.560
But she doesn't do it
to anyone else.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.400
Shows you how special you are.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.680
Right. I want bacon and sausage,
eggs and beans, please.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.920
Right, and cheese to follow?

03:39.960 --> 03:42.559
Cheese? Yeah, cheese.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.160
It's all right,
we've got plenty, don't panic.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.000
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.360
I don't know...

04:05.320 --> 04:06.680
What's wrong with it?

04:06.720 --> 04:09.760
You'd better give me another one
as a spare, just in case.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.200
How long are you going
to be nasty about it?

04:25.240 --> 04:29.279
Well, I was thinking, maybe ALWAYS.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.839
Your brother gets me into more
trouble than your mother does.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.720
Have you no compassion?

04:34.760 --> 04:36.760
His heart is broken!

04:36.800 --> 04:40.040
Ah, but in fairness, I don't think
his head's fully functioning.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.119
And just remember,
who, on their day off,

04:44.120 --> 04:48.120
took him out and looked after him?
You call that looking after him?!

04:48.160 --> 04:50.079
I said take him out and amuse him.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.320
Not lose him!

04:53.440 --> 04:55.000
Don't think it was easy!

04:56.160 --> 04:57.560
He took some losing.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.959
Why do you dislike our Lester?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.640
I don't dislike your Lester.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.400
I just dislike
your Lester being here.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.240
He misses his wife.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.760
I miss mine.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.040
Oh, don't start.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.000
Oh, come on.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.080
How can you keep running that iron
over me undies and not feel playful?

05:24.920 --> 05:26.720
HISSING

05:26.760 --> 05:29.120
It's ten o'clock in the morning.
Get real!

05:30.640 --> 05:34.880
I have been seriously misled
about the joys of togetherness!

05:49.440 --> 05:50.920
Ooh!
BELL RINGS

05:55.920 --> 05:58.919
Hello, Mavis. Hello, Granville.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.680
Oh, I love the way you say, "Hello,
Granville". It gets me every time.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.359
It's just a "Hello, Granville."

06:05.360 --> 06:09.960
No, it's not, it's the Mona Lisa
of Hello, Granvilles.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.959
So, what have you come
in the shop for, some cheese?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.800
Oh, I'm sorry. Naughty,
you shouldn't have said that.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.560
You get a free pass.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.280
What were you doing down there
behind the counter? Oh?

06:24.320 --> 06:27.440
Well, I was looking
for your lost earring.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.000
But I haven't lost one.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.560
No, that's because I haven't
got you behind here yet.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.000
You make me blush!
I've got a cure for that.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.600
I wish.

06:37.640 --> 06:41.480
It's down here somewhere,
along with that earring you've lost.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.280
Ha-ha, ha-ha.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.559
Come and help me look?

06:45.560 --> 06:47.040
Someone always comes in.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.240
I know, it's the grocer's lottery.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.360
We always live on the edge.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.720
Look, we really do need a van,
cos I... Oh, get out!

07:05.080 --> 07:06.680
It's none of my business -

07:06.720 --> 07:09.720
this thing between you
and Mrs Featherstone...

07:09.760 --> 07:12.320
I don't see it as a thing.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.400
It's illegal!
I've been kidnapped.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.480
She doesn't keep me locked up,
but it's there.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.119
You must be very attractive
to women.

07:21.120 --> 07:25.799
Me? I let the hair grow in me ears,
I wear long underwear!

07:25.800 --> 07:28.680
In summer?
Well, lightweight in summer.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.519
No, no! You must have something.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.679
You come out the blue
and she makes a beeline for you.

07:36.680 --> 07:40.000
You're some kind of...
honeypot for women.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.080
You wish to hear my secret fantasy?

07:46.320 --> 07:47.920
Now we're getting somewhere!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
I wish to drive the Flying Scotsman.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.239
You won't give it up, will you?

07:58.240 --> 08:01.120
You've got the secret
and you're keeping it.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.760
I'll tell you what I am doing -
I'm toughening up.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.320
I intend to rid myself
of Mrs Featherstone.

08:08.360 --> 08:12.359
Come along, Mr Newbould. You'll need
your car to take me into town.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.560
See ya.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.680
So, you want to know the secret of
Mr Newbould's power over the ladies?

08:24.720 --> 08:28.839
I don't know about ladies, I thought
it was just Mrs Featherstone.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.400
Oh! No, no, no.
He's got them all over.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.720
He's known as The Bull
down at the bowling club.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.880
Bull Newbould? Mm-hm!

08:38.919 --> 08:42.720
I knew he was trying
to hold out on me! Ha-ha!

08:42.760 --> 08:45.200
Tells me he wears long underwear.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.440
Oh, no. Jockeys.
Practically a thong.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.920
Lying old fraud! He-he!

08:53.960 --> 08:59.239
Does Mrs Featherstone know about
his, er, extra bowling activities?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.760
Shh, shh! No, no, no, no,
you mustn't say a word.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.080
She'd kill him!
Hey, his secret's safe with me.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.560
I'm tight as a drum.
My missus calls me The Clamp.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.600
Anyway, let's get down to it.
So, what is this secret?

09:12.640 --> 09:18.679
Well, it is a little underrated
dairy product that I keep for him.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.560
But if you could keep
your mouth shut...

09:22.600 --> 09:24.400
I'm a clam, me.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.080
I can only whisper it.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.519
Go on, then. Go 'ead.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.199
Cheese.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.160
Cheese? Shh!

09:35.200 --> 09:38.039
Cheese. Cheese? Yes. Oh!

09:38.040 --> 09:40.640
Is it some sort of special cheese,
not ordinary cheese?

09:40.680 --> 09:45.120
It's all got
this powerful effect on...

09:45.160 --> 09:47.360
certain hormones.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.200
It's what you said
about the Marmite.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.879
It never worked for me.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.879
No, that was because you were
in such a hurry, weren't you?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.760
I mean, you wouldn't wait

09:56.800 --> 09:59.959
until Venus
was in configuration with Mars!

09:59.960 --> 10:02.960
It was the only weekend
her mother was away.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.639
Well, you can't push these things.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.480
There are limits, even to Marmite.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.120
But... Cheese,
you will be pleased to hear,

10:12.160 --> 10:15.080
works any evening after 7pm.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.840
They, say if you eat cheese late,
you can't sleep.

10:21.960 --> 10:26.520
And I'm saying, if you do eat cheese
late, you won't WANT to sleep.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.960
Oh?

10:45.720 --> 10:48.920
Er, not yet. I'll tell you when.

10:48.960 --> 10:51.320
I thought we might take
this quiet moment

10:51.360 --> 10:54.560
to agree some small advance
in our relationship.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.840
Well, it seems to have advanced
pretty rapidly to me.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.360
But I've kept you
at arm's length, Mr Newbould.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.199
Which has always been my custom in
the first flush of an entanglement.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.360
Arm's length is fine by me,
I'm really quite...

11:08.400 --> 11:11.680
You've been very good,
you've held yourself in check,

11:11.720 --> 11:14.839
it's not gone unnoticed.
And, as a reward,

11:14.840 --> 11:18.240
I think it's time to release you
a little from full restraint.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.000
What do you have in mind?
Oh, nothing as far as that!

11:24.040 --> 11:28.280
No, I thought I might just allow you
a few minor shows of affection.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.359
Are you sure? I mean, I'm quite...

11:30.360 --> 11:33.279
Nothing radical!
A peck on the cheek,

11:33.280 --> 11:35.839
you could take my arm
occasionally...

11:35.840 --> 11:37.440
I don't want you leaping on me!

11:49.040 --> 11:50.840
DRILLING

11:57.000 --> 11:59.400
Look at me. Hmm?

11:59.440 --> 12:01.120
I'm bow-legged!

12:01.160 --> 12:03.079
I've had a word with Gastric.

12:03.080 --> 12:06.000
You know he dabbles
in second-hand vehicles?

12:06.040 --> 12:09.760
Well, I've got one
coming for us to look at.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.919
Ohh! Oh-ho-ho!

12:11.920 --> 12:13.400
Hey, all right!

12:13.440 --> 12:16.240
Don't do that,
I don't know where they've been.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.080
What are you drilling?

12:21.600 --> 12:23.359
Cheese.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
Oh, right, as you do.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.880
Yes, well,
they don't like the hard variety,

12:27.920 --> 12:32.680
so I thought to see how they'd get
on with the Yorkshire Swiss kind.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.639
Yeah. Right.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.960
Swiss.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.040
Thank you. Oh, haven't you got
anything smaller?

12:55.080 --> 12:58.359
Er, sorry.
It is possible, Mrs Hussein,

12:58.360 --> 13:01.679
that you have been given
a forged note.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.880
What would happen then? I would
just have to give it back to you.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.440
Well, wouldn't that mean that
YOU were passing forged notes?

13:11.640 --> 13:15.720
No, it would mean that
I'm refusing to accept it.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.919
I could come back later,
when you've finished. Right...

13:34.920 --> 13:37.280
I think this one's all right, yeah.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.120
You don't look too sure.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.360
You never can be too sure,
as a grocer,

13:42.400 --> 13:45.000
with all the wickedness out there.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.440
Oh, you've heard about
her at number 14, then?

13:51.680 --> 13:54.240
So, I'm busy in the kitchen....
DRIER WHIRS

13:54.280 --> 13:58.039
..and the door opens
and Eric pops his head round

13:58.040 --> 14:01.040
and he gives me this look
and he says...

14:01.080 --> 14:03.519
LIKE ERIC: "Why don't
we eat more cheese?!"

14:03.520 --> 14:05.120
..slams the door and he's gone!

14:07.120 --> 14:09.400
Have you had him looked at lately?

14:09.440 --> 14:11.000
Where would you start?

14:12.440 --> 14:15.079
Is your Eric sleeping?

14:15.080 --> 14:17.120
I've no idea.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.439
He's in the other bedroom.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.360
He's on punishment detail.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.520
Oh? Your mother, I say,
your mother would be proud.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.920
What's he done?
Is it specific, or just tactical?

14:31.320 --> 14:33.400
He lost my brother.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.560
Ooh! Shows initiative.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.639
How did he manage that?

14:37.640 --> 14:40.519
He left him in B&Q,
looking at the lawn mowers.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.639
Eric said he forgot him.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.680
You can forget people.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.360
I forget people.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.000
Not in B&Q!

14:50.360 --> 14:52.560
Some people are easy to forget.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.120
My third husband was a natural,
you could forget him anywhere.

14:56.160 --> 15:00.160
I used to wake up sometimes in
a panic and think, "Who's this?"

15:00.200 --> 15:02.200
THEY GIGGLE

15:12.800 --> 15:13.839
HE BLOWS

15:13.840 --> 15:15.200
RAZOR BUZZES

15:23.960 --> 15:25.440
Ah! Ha-ha-ha.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.240
BELL RINGS

15:32.080 --> 15:37.559
Ah! Listen, the only thing I can
find for you, at your price...

15:37.560 --> 15:40.560
I'll take it. Well, you'd better
have a look at it first.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.520
Well, of course
I'll have a look at it.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.440
You don't think
I'd throw money away, do you?

15:44.480 --> 15:46.800
Well, if you did,
it would be on a piece of elastic.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.759
You smell of diesel.
Of course I smell of diesel!

15:51.760 --> 15:55.360
What decent, practical bloke
doesn't smell of diesel?

15:59.280 --> 16:01.120
Ohh! What's that?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.360
25p. Eh?

16:04.760 --> 16:09.640
Right, now, put that on,
so we don't spoil the surprise.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.520
Come along, yeah.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.280
Right this way.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.880
Not long now.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.560
Ha-ha-ha.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.559
Does he realise she's clapped out?

16:18.560 --> 16:19.880
Shh!

16:19.920 --> 16:23.320
Right, you stay there,
won't be a moment.

16:23.360 --> 16:28.799
Listen, don't say it was
clapped out, just say, um,

16:28.800 --> 16:32.600
it's a good little runner,
but needs a bit of attention.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.199
Hello? Shut up, we're coming!

16:35.200 --> 16:38.440
Now, did you fill the tank up?
Not for what you're paying!

16:39.920 --> 16:42.120
I wouldn't overdo it, for a start.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.360
I should build
the fuel up gradually,

16:44.400 --> 16:46.840
let her get used to the weight.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.640
Right.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.319
Hello? We're coming!

16:51.320 --> 16:54.120
I'm going to take his bucket off.

16:54.160 --> 17:00.120
So, I want you to stand by the van
and look proud, OK? Right.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.840
All right, now, stand by.

17:02.880 --> 17:07.000
I don't want you rushing around the
countryside, driving like a lunatic.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.960
Are you ready?
Here comes the surprise.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.839
Yes! Ooh! Oh?

17:13.440 --> 17:14.839
Ta-da!

17:14.880 --> 17:16.240
Hee-hee-hee.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.040
Can I have my bucket back, please?

17:26.240 --> 17:27.878
No.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.600
Don't worry about the bodywork.
That's just, um, cosmetic.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.239
A touch of paint. Well, it had
better be a light touch, Gastric,

17:36.240 --> 17:38.280
or you'll be through
what's left of the metal!

17:44.840 --> 17:47.359
More tea? Sit still.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.519
You go flying out into that kitchen

17:49.520 --> 17:51.600
and I don't see you
for half an hour.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.079
What do you do out there?
I make the tea.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.679
A person could dehydrate.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.959
I think you go out there
and deliberately dawdle.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.440
The kettle has to boil.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.880
Well, I don't see any signs
of steam arising from you.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.760
Are you afraid of me, Mr Newbould?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.080
I wouldn't say...

18:21.680 --> 18:23.240
But then again, perhaps I would.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
Yes, I would.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.360
You terrify me.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.239
Excellent.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.240
I can sense the progress
since we began. What began?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.520
When did we begin?

18:38.560 --> 18:40.839
One moment I was living alone.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.440
Now look at me.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.240
Are those the socks
you wore last week?

18:49.720 --> 18:52.159
Well, they have been washed
in the interim.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.999
Those are very old widower's socks,
Mr Newbould.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.400
They are joyless socks.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.359
They do not say life
has regained its sparkle.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.919
I will not buy sparkling socks.

19:03.920 --> 19:06.999
Well, you'll have
to do better than those.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.120
That is not one of the 50 shades
of grey everybody's talking about.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.199
HE SIGHS

19:18.200 --> 19:21.200
Right, well, how do I get
this seat forward? I don't know.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.679
Well, there's probably a lever
down there, I think. Yes, right.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.399
Oh, yeah, got it.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.560
THUD!

19:27.600 --> 19:29.320
So, I... Huh?

19:29.360 --> 19:32.119
Oh, there you are.
All right, come on, that way.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.879
Yeah, there you go.
You were a bit urgent there.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.679
Yes, it's on a ratchet,
you'll feel it click in.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.279
What I feel is embarrassed!

19:41.280 --> 19:43.720
Well, what we need is the manual.

19:43.760 --> 19:47.320
There should be
a driver's manual here somewhere.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.400
For something this age?
It'll be in Latin!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.840
Ha-ha, in Latin!

19:52.880 --> 19:57.080
Very good. Um, no, it'll be in
the glove compartment, won't it?

19:59.120 --> 20:04.040
It's a bit, um... Oh, it just
probably needs just a screw.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.480
Give it to Gastric, will you?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.040
Right, um...

20:12.600 --> 20:17.399
Well, why don't we, er...
you know, start her up, eh?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.040
ENGINE STRUGGLES

20:19.080 --> 20:20.280
LOUD BANG

20:20.320 --> 20:21.519
Yeah, she's trying.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.559
IT STRUGGLES
THEN BANGS AGAIN

20:23.560 --> 20:24.640
She's trying.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.399
IT STRUGGLES
THEN BANGS AGAIN

20:26.400 --> 20:27.559
She's still trying.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.719
ENGINE STARTS
Hey!

20:29.720 --> 20:31.199
She's off!

20:31.200 --> 20:33.080
She's... Yes!

20:33.120 --> 20:35.280
She's off and running.

20:35.320 --> 20:39.400
Sounds sweet enough, doesn't it,
once she settles down?

20:39.440 --> 20:42.199
Well, you've got everything here,
haven't you?

20:42.200 --> 20:46.719
Look at this! You've got heating,
look, and air conditioning, eh?

20:46.720 --> 20:50.240
So, whilst I'm in the shop,
you know, sweating away,

20:50.280 --> 20:55.640
you'll be swanning around being
like, you know, Mr Cool, yeah?

20:55.680 --> 20:58.520
Go on, give it a try.
Air con, go on.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.720
Oh! Ah, ah!

21:01.760 --> 21:03.160
Hey, hey!

21:03.200 --> 21:06.200
No, that's...
Switch it off! Switch it off!

21:08.280 --> 21:10.240
Hey! Ah! Ah!

21:13.320 --> 21:15.720
Well, it is cool, isn't it?

21:15.760 --> 21:18.000
Freezing! Yeah.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.800
Oh, right.

21:19.840 --> 21:24.319
Anyway, let's, um, let's reverse her
out of the yard, shall we?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.720
Give her a run down the road.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.160
Handbrake off...

21:31.080 --> 21:37.080
When I said take it off, I didn't
mean, you know, TAKE IT OFF, did I?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.880
Give it to... Gastric?

21:42.720 --> 21:45.560
All right, that's it! What?

21:45.600 --> 21:47.400
Well, you're buying too cheap.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.640
HE TURNS THE ENGINE OFF
Rubbish! Correct.

21:51.680 --> 21:54.239
Oh! Agh! Agh!

21:54.240 --> 21:55.999
Agh! Agh-agh! Oh!

21:56.000 --> 21:59.399
No, no. No! No! Take her back.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.840
I had this dream -

22:00.880 --> 22:04.520
leather upholstery,
smooth, glossy paintwork.

22:06.360 --> 22:09.200
Not something that looks
like a four-wheeled carrot!

22:10.400 --> 22:12.000
GRUNTS OF PAIN

22:13.880 --> 22:17.159
You must have another vehicle
that you can't get rid of

22:17.160 --> 22:19.120
that would suit our needs?

22:19.160 --> 22:20.160
Huh?

22:22.800 --> 22:24.920
There, look at these noble lines.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.840
Look at the polish on her.

22:26.880 --> 22:29.080
She looks all right from front.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.520
Then again,
so does she at number 14.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.960
Yeah, well, imagine her surprise
when you turn up in this!

22:36.000 --> 22:38.440
Yeah, I can imagine.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.200
Hey, I never knew that about cheese.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.840
Oh, the Government keeps it quiet.

22:52.880 --> 22:56.080
They're worried
about overpopulation.

22:56.120 --> 22:59.320
So, how much do you want?
Oh, I'll take the whole piece.

22:59.360 --> 23:00.799
Oh, right!

23:00.800 --> 23:01.999
Ha-ha!

23:02.000 --> 23:05.040
Oh, doesn't anybody have
the right change any more?

23:05.080 --> 23:09.200
Well, I can come back tomorrow.
No, it's OK. I'll check it.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.200
Oh, they've started
talking to you now!

23:18.880 --> 23:21.280
They must know
who's their biggest fan.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.400
I reserve the right to return this
if it isn't kosher.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.880
Well, if it's coming back,
don't wear it out.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.720
Sign there.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.599
So I know where it's come from.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.000
Well, it came from you,
20 minutes ago! Oh, ha-ha!

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
BELL RINGS

23:47.000 --> 23:50.279
That thing is going
to ruin my love life.

23:50.280 --> 23:55.400
Most people's love life
works perfectly satisfactorily

23:55.440 --> 23:57.360
on leather upholstery.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.960
Not if you can't even
get them inside!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.520
BELL RINGS

24:06.880 --> 24:09.000
I hope it's... no-one close.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.280
Eh? The hearse outside!

24:13.920 --> 24:19.160
OK, OK, so it looks a bit
too much like what it was.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.600
But it's beautiful.
Pfft! He means cheap.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.360
It just needs commercialising.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.799
A few adverts on it,
you know, to make it our own.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.760
Right, so, Gastric,
you go and get your tools.

24:32.800 --> 24:36.679
Cyril, you will help him, right?
Oh, I was just passing.

24:36.680 --> 24:40.119
I really ought to get back...
Oh, don't fight it, Cyril.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.200
You've been conscripted. Oh.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.039
And apparently, he left his undies
behind, with his initials on!

24:51.040 --> 24:53.280
Well, if you get
that close to a man,

24:53.320 --> 24:55.520
you ought to know what his name is.

24:55.560 --> 25:00.359
Initials are a bit unnecessary.
It's like wearing a number plate.

25:00.360 --> 25:03.040
Well, I can't see
the point of initials.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.480
If there was a whole chapter, at
least you'd have something to read.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.520
Oh, I can't read in bed.
The cat objects.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.799
I like Eric to read in bed.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.520
I've always got a spare book ready,
just in case he finishes one.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.600
You should train your husband.
I trained all mine.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.800
What were you training them for?

25:20.840 --> 25:23.120
Well, I wasn't entering them
for anything.

25:23.160 --> 25:26.639
It's like climbing Everest,
you do it because they're there.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.840
Mine was rarely there.

25:28.880 --> 25:32.200
Which is the nicest thing
he ever did for me. Cheers!

25:32.240 --> 25:34.840
ALL: Cheers!
THEY GIGGLE

25:44.840 --> 25:47.599
It was like catching the wrong bus,
when I got married.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.239
As soon as I saw his initials
on his pyjamas,

25:50.240 --> 25:53.200
I knew who
he was really in love with.

25:53.240 --> 25:57.519
You see more than initials.
Some people have tattoos

25:57.520 --> 26:01.040
where nobody's any business
sticking their nib in.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.600
Eric wanted one. A dagger!

26:03.640 --> 26:06.040
I said, "Eric, start
with something you know.

26:06.080 --> 26:08.479
"You know, like a pencil
with a rubber on the end."

26:08.480 --> 26:10.280
LAUGHTER

26:10.320 --> 26:13.520
You can get some that,
if you jiggle them about,

26:13.560 --> 26:15.160
they look like they're moving!

26:15.200 --> 26:16.880
They're called husbands.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.440
I think I can honestly say all of
mine went to their graves unmarked.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.280
On the outside, anyway.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.400
Leroy? How's the shop?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.959
The new van is fine.

26:34.960 --> 26:38.720
Well, it's a classic vehicle.

26:38.760 --> 26:42.560
I've got a few more errands to run,
and then I'll be back.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.360
'Well, we got them to the church
on time in the end.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.200
'Although they looked a bit agitated

27:36.240 --> 27:40.040
'while I sorted my cardboard
from my plastics.

27:44.560 --> 27:48.800
'I don't know why our Leroy
has taken against it.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.240
'I thought the young
were all in favour

27:51.280 --> 27:52.680
'of plenty of room in the back.'

27:59.600 --> 28:01.560
Have you got any special offers?

28:01.600 --> 28:04.040
Yes, I have. Fresh in today.

28:04.080 --> 28:06.760
Oh, my favourite kind. Come on.
THEY GIGGLE

28:13.200 --> 28:18.240
'I wonder if I could interest Mavis
in that last bit of cheese.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.360
'Maybe it does have powerful effects
after all. Hee-hee.'
