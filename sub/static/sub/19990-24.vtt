little sea star eat!

20:55.520 --> 20:56.586
He's inching closer to McNulty,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.388
and it looks like McNulty
can feel the heat.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.890
Never has there been
a more prodigious display

21:00.892 --> 21:01.791
of competitive eating.

21:01.793 --> 21:04.861
The amount of patties
being consumed is astounding.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.163
[all whimpering]

21:09.900 --> 21:11.768
And now, yes, yes,

21:11.770 --> 21:13.903
Patrick Star has matched
Oswald McNulty,

21:13.905 --> 21:17.440
and they are tied as they
come into the homestretch.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.475
Both eaters are now so full,

21:18.477 --> 21:20.010
they can barely eat,
but eat they do.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.145
Moving so slowly now,
one can't help but wonder

21:22.147 --> 21:26.449
if they are going to hit the
patty wall at some point,

21:26.451 --> 21:27.684
and--and...

21:27.686 --> 21:28.785
both eaters have stopped!

21:28.787 --> 21:31.021
With only seconds left,
we are tied in patties eaten,

21:31.023 --> 21:33.857
and neither one seems
to have the room to go on.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.660
Oh!
What's this?

21:36.662 --> 21:39.963
And down goes McNulty!
Down goes McNulty!

21:39.965 --> 21:42.432
It looks like
we could have a tie.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.535
- It's over, SpongeBob.
I can't go on.

21:45.537 --> 21:49.606
- The taste, Patrick.
Remember the taste.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.974
- The... taste.

21:50.976 --> 21:51.841
- What's this?

21:51.843 --> 21:53.743
Patrick Star has risen
from his seat

21:53.745 --> 21:54.844
and is pointing
to center field.

21:54.846 --> 21:59.749
No, wait. He's pointing to
"widdle" boy with a hurt foot.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.951
Ladies and gentlemen,
he's pointing to his mouth

22:01.953 --> 22:03.119
as if to indicate something.

22:03.121 --> 22:06.790
- Here you go, champ.
You can have mine.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.993
[taste buds cheering]

22:09.995 --> 22:13.096
- And he's eating.
He's eating!

22:13.098 --> 22:16.700
The Great Starbino
is eating!

22:16.702 --> 22:18.802
Patrick Star wins!

22:18.804 --> 22:21.938
The belt is back
in Bikini Bottom!

22:21.940 --> 22:24.708
The belt is back
in Bikini Bottom!

22:24.710 --> 22:29.212
- Here you go, son.
You earned it fat and square.

22:29.214 --> 22:30.547
- Yay!

22:30.549 --> 22:31.781
- Congratulations,
Starbino.

22:31.783 --> 22:34.584
So are you going to defend
the belt next year?

22:34.586 --> 22:38.688
- No, this thing
doesn't even fit.

22:38.690 --> 22:42.692
- Ow!
My other foot.
