00:27.569 --> 00:30.030
<i>Nearly six years after invading Gaul,</i>

00:30.739 --> 00:34.034
<i>Julius Caesar has just one territory
left to conquer</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:37.037
<i>before he can return to Rome
and claim his glory...</i>

00:37.996 --> 00:38.914
<i>Alesia.</i>

00:41.667 --> 00:43.252
<i>He builds a wall,</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.421
<i>trapping 60,000 Gauls inside</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:50.050
<i>led by their general Vercingetorix.</i>

00:52.261 --> 00:55.097
<i>Less than a mile away,
behind a second wall,</i>

00:55.764 --> 01:00.269
<i>are 120,000 soldiers from different tribes
across Gaul.</i>

01:04.940 --> 01:09.361
<i>If Caesar and his army of 60,000 men
can't defend the walls...</i>

01:10.112 --> 01:11.947
<i>Caesar will lose everything.</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:20.998
<i>Get to positions!</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.659
Archers, nock!

02:00.829 --> 02:01.788
Draw!

02:03.332 --> 02:04.166
Release!

02:10.172 --> 02:11.089
Draw!

02:13.050 --> 02:13.884
Release!

02:33.445 --> 02:35.906
<i>As Caesar's men
defend the outer wall,</i>

02:40.035 --> 02:40.952
<i>on the inside...</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:43.372
Ladders, now!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.168
<i>...Vercingetorix makes his move.</i>

02:50.962 --> 02:51.797
Shields!

03:10.399 --> 03:12.609
Breach! Outer wall!

03:14.903 --> 03:19.282
<i>The Romans secure the interior,
but the outer wall is breached.</i>

03:20.742 --> 03:21.910
Go!

03:25.622 --> 03:31.712
The Gauls manage to discover
a weak point in the walls.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.263
The Gauls identified this as a spot

03:41.388 --> 03:44.015
that they could converge
all of their forces on

03:44.099 --> 03:45.976
and break the Roman siege lines.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.770
We need help!

03:54.609 --> 03:56.361
Hold the wall!

04:00.157 --> 04:02.284
Get the reinforcements! Now!

04:11.293 --> 04:14.838
<i>But Caesar responds
with a stroke of military genius.</i>

04:16.964 --> 04:19.968
The Romans converged on that one spot
to protect it,

04:20.969 --> 04:23.972
and then Caesar led out
a cavalry detachment

04:24.055 --> 04:26.683
to come around the back
of the relief army.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.782
The Gauls then believed that they had been
surrounded by the Romans,

04:41.865 --> 04:44.701
and caught in that pincer,
they disintegrated.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.662
The Gauls are retreating.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.420
<i>Against overwhelming odds,</i>

04:56.588 --> 04:59.966
<i>Julius Caesar and his men outlast
two armies</i>

05:01.259 --> 05:05.388
<i>in one of the greatest
military achievements in Roman history.</i>

06:39.858 --> 06:41.526
<i>After four days of fighting,</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:45.113
<i>and a hundred thousand dead,</i>

06:48.074 --> 06:49.910
<i>Caesar has done the impossible...</i>

06:50.869 --> 06:52.621
<i>defeating the Gauls at Alesia.</i>

07:35.246 --> 07:37.749
<i>There was no hope for Vercingetorix.</i>

07:41.503 --> 07:43.755
He knew that he couldn't carry on the war

07:45.590 --> 07:47.592
and he knew that he couldn't stay
inside the city

07:47.676 --> 07:49.177
because they would all starve to death.

08:10.073 --> 08:10.907
Please...

08:12.367 --> 08:14.577
spare the lives of my men.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.956
It's all I ask.

08:38.643 --> 08:39.936
Put him in chains.

08:56.661 --> 09:01.082
<i>With Vercingetorix's surrender,
Caesar has won more than a battle...</i>

09:02.167 --> 09:04.419
<i>he's conquered all of Gaul.</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:11.509
The advantage that Vercingetorix's revolt
had for Caesar was that

09:11.593 --> 09:17.682
it unified all of the forces in Gaul
under a single head and a single leader,

09:17.766 --> 09:22.645
and it allowed Caesar to cut that head off
in one fell swoop.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.070
<i>Caesar's victory transforms
the Roman Republic,</i>

09:30.862 --> 09:34.491
<i>expanding its territory
by 200,000 square miles.</i>

09:35.658 --> 09:39.454
<i>Making it the largest single
military conquest in Roman history.</i>

09:42.874 --> 09:46.795
Julius Caesar stretches the Roman Empire
out all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.714
Making essentially
that part of Europe Roman,

09:50.048 --> 09:53.134
which would shape all of Europe
even today.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.723
<i>Roman soldiers begin settling
this new territory,</i>

10:00.225 --> 10:04.437
<i>which will eventually become cities,
like Paris and Geneva.</i>

10:06.147 --> 10:07.232
<i>But for Caesar,</i>

10:08.108 --> 10:11.194
<i>the only thing on his mind
is returning to Rome.</i>

10:26.084 --> 10:29.671
<i>As Caesar returns home
to reclaim the power he once had,</i>

10:35.969 --> 10:38.596
<i>he sends messengers ahead
with news of the battle,</i>

10:41.349 --> 10:45.436
<i>as well as gold and treasure
to be spent on the Roman people.</i>

10:53.361 --> 10:58.074
There are huge festivals held in the city
to celebrate Caesar's success.

11:02.745 --> 11:06.541
There are public banquets,
gladiatorial combats,

11:07.542 --> 11:10.336
and there are distributions of free food,

11:11.713 --> 11:16.551
so that the people are well aware
that Caesar's success is good for them.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.347
<i>The festivities last
for 20 straight days,</i>

11:22.140 --> 11:23.975
<i>captivating the Roman people.</i>

11:27.437 --> 11:32.358
<i>The conquest of Gaul makes Caesar
the most popular person in Rome.</i>

11:33.484 --> 11:36.237
<i>These victories are massive.</i>

11:36.321 --> 11:41.117
These victories make him famous,
these victories make him rich.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.038
He is by far the strongest man in Rome.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.084
<i>But not everyone is happy
with Caesar's success.</i>

11:59.761 --> 12:02.722
<i>Eight years after forcing Caesar
out of Rome,</i>

12:04.057 --> 12:06.851
<i>Pompey realizes he's made a big mistake.</i>

12:10.521 --> 12:14.442
Pompey sees Caesar's new popularity
as a direct threat.

12:15.693 --> 12:20.365
Caesar is now perhaps more powerful
than the rest of the Senate put together.

12:22.033 --> 12:26.537
It was clear that the relationship
was coming under increasing strain.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.879
<i>If Pompey hopes to retain
any form of power</i>

12:35.964 --> 12:37.674
<i>he must get rid of Caesar...</i>

12:38.508 --> 12:39.550
<i>for good.</i>

12:53.564 --> 12:54.774
Julius Caesar...

12:56.109 --> 12:58.778
he sent Rome to war
without our permission,

12:58.861 --> 13:02.198
illegally raised legions
without our approval.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.995
Butchered entire towns.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.707
Starved women and children.
Slaughtered hundreds of thousands.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.544
All so he could line his pockets
with the spoils of war.

13:16.546 --> 13:20.508
Caesar is a threat to our Republic.

13:24.470 --> 13:28.641
He's shown no regard for the Senate.
No regard for anyone but himself.

13:31.185 --> 13:36.566
We are all proud of the remarkable
achievements of our soldiers,

13:38.568 --> 13:41.779
but he must be held accountable
for his actions.

13:44.407 --> 13:48.244
He must be stripped of his command
immediatelyand ordered to return to Rome,

13:52.165 --> 13:54.459
where he will stand trial.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.302
Caesar had a lot of enemies
back home in Rome

14:04.385 --> 14:06.387
who saw how popular he was,

14:06.846 --> 14:10.350
not only with the people but with the army
and what a brilliant commander he was.

14:10.641 --> 14:14.979
And they were very concerned
that he was getting far too much power.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.984
All those in favor?

14:27.575 --> 14:29.285
<i>In a unanimous vote,</i>

14:29.369 --> 14:32.288
<i>the Senate agrees to bring charges
against Caesar.</i>

14:43.341 --> 14:47.011
<i>One of the men who sides with Pompey
is an ambitious senator...</i>

14:47.929 --> 14:49.347
<i>named Marcus Brutus.</i>

14:52.475 --> 14:54.394
Brutus was Servilia's son,

14:55.645 --> 14:57.939
and she, of course, was Caesar's mistress.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.903
What's your name?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.197
Brutus.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.495
<i>Brutus grows up admiring Caesar</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:15.873
<i>and considers him a father figure.</i>

15:35.184 --> 15:36.269
Did you stand?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.689
It was unanimous.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.317
They've already selected his replacement.

15:46.821 --> 15:48.239
I know you have feelings for him.

15:50.825 --> 15:51.909
But I thought it best.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.622
Then you did what you needed to do.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.379
<i>While Brutus has a
personal loyalty to Caesar,</i>

16:03.921 --> 16:07.008
<i>his mother raised him to always choose
the winning side.</i>

16:13.306 --> 16:15.600
Brutus was very noble, he was ambitious,

16:15.683 --> 16:18.186
like any other man of his generation.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.608
And like many Romans, Brutus's ambitions
would have been to get to the top.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.043
Are you going to tell me?

16:43.044 --> 16:44.712
I'm being stripped of my command.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.672
What?

16:48.216 --> 16:49.926
They're ordering me back to Rome

16:50.968 --> 16:52.136
to face charges.

16:52.970 --> 16:53.804
For what?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.349
Illegally levying troops.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.519
This is bullshit. Tell them no.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.937
And be forced into exile?

17:03.898 --> 17:06.567
You won't get a fair trial.
Pompey will make sure of that.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.163
Julia...

17:19.914 --> 17:21.207
has passed...

17:22.666 --> 17:24.085
during child birth.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.342
I'm sorry.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.013
I'll be outside

17:36.973 --> 17:37.974
if you need anything.

17:43.688 --> 17:48.317
<i>Caesar is blindsided
by the death of Julia, his only child.</i>

17:50.152 --> 17:54.323
<i>When Julia died in childbirth,
Caesar was destroyed.</i>

17:56.576 --> 17:58.119
<i>She was his only daughter,</i>

17:58.786 --> 18:03.749
and the heir not only to his fortune,
but also to his family's prestige.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.088
<i>For the first time in his life,</i>

18:09.463 --> 18:10.965
<i>Caesar is alone in the world,</i>

18:13.301 --> 18:16.512
<i>and must decide if he'll accept
the senate's terms</i>

18:16.596 --> 18:19.849
<i>or ignore them
and march his troops into Rome.</i>

18:36.532 --> 18:37.408
One!

18:38.159 --> 18:40.036
Two! Back!

18:40.745 --> 18:45.499
Caesar expected to come back
from his victories in Gaul to be acclaimed

18:45.583 --> 18:49.086
and then to be re-elected as consul
for a second time.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.339
Back! One!

18:51.422 --> 18:55.593
But his enemies in the Senate
were dead set against that happening,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.803
and Pompey was on their side.

18:59.096 --> 19:03.142
One! Two! Back! Three!

19:05.770 --> 19:09.357
<i>Caesar and his troops
make it to the border of Gaul and Italy</i>

19:09.982 --> 19:12.652
<i>to a narrow river called the Rubicon.</i>

19:21.619 --> 19:24.080
<i>If Caesar crosses this boundary
with an army,</i>

19:24.914 --> 19:26.165
<i>in the eyes of the law,</i>

19:27.041 --> 19:28.626
<i>he'd be invading Rome.</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:36.133
Caesar really had a choice to make.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.097
Do I give up, come back,
get prosecuted by my enemies,

19:41.305 --> 19:43.099
and be banished for life?

19:44.141 --> 19:44.975
Or...

19:45.267 --> 19:46.727
do I cross this boundary?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.773
Do I come into Italy

19:51.315 --> 19:54.860
and point this Roman army at Rome itself?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.133
<i>In January of 49 B.C.,</i>

20:18.134 --> 20:22.096
<i>Caesar and his men,
the strongest legion in all of Rome,</i>

20:22.972 --> 20:24.598
<i>cross the Rubicon river.</i>

20:27.977 --> 20:31.731
Crossing the Rubicon
officially began a civil war.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.942
Caesar was now
a rebellious military general

20:35.151 --> 20:38.571
leading Roman troops
against the city of Rome itself.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.825
Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon

20:42.908 --> 20:45.536
was really one of the pivotal events
in history.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.914
Caesar wasn't going to allow himself
to be pushed around

20:48.998 --> 20:52.293
and to be deprived of what he felt
was his due.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.007
<i>Crossing the Rubicon
is not only an act of war,</i>

20:59.049 --> 21:01.802
<i>it's the defining moment
in Caesar's career.</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:04.764
<i>And the core of his legacy.</i>

21:06.432 --> 21:09.852
I think the fact that we still
have the phrase "crossing the Rubicon"

21:10.394 --> 21:14.690
has to do with the fact
that there was no u-turn.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.526
You could not cross the Rubicon,
then decide against it.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.071
He had committed himself and his troops
to marching on Rome

21:21.363 --> 21:23.157
and that's why it's remained
with us today.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.164
<i>Knowing he can't turn back,</i>

21:30.414 --> 21:33.793
<i>Caesar and 5,000 troops begin marching
toward Rome...</i>

21:36.587 --> 21:38.005
<i>to overtake the capital.</i>

21:48.432 --> 21:51.143
You pressed us to issue an ultimatum.

21:51.769 --> 21:53.562
We should never had brought charges.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.732
He could sack Rome just as easily
as he took Gaul.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.067
We won't let that happen.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.947
Our armies outnumber Caesar's
three to one.

22:04.365 --> 22:05.783
So call them to Rome!

22:08.118 --> 22:09.203
We need to leave.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.581
Abandon Rome?

22:12.915 --> 22:14.750
For the time being, yes.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.087
I'll send word for my legions
to assemble in Greece.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.296
We'll meet them there.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.841
We're just giving Rome to Caesar?

22:24.218 --> 22:25.886
I'm not giving him anything.

22:35.479 --> 22:36.647
<i>For the senators,</i>

22:37.398 --> 22:40.025
<i>leaving Rome may look
like a desperate act,</i>

22:42.236 --> 22:45.781
<i>but Pompey knows he can't defeat Caesar
without an army.</i>

22:48.033 --> 22:51.912
Pompey is a very resourceful general
and he has a plan.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.124
The plan is to pull out of Italy

22:55.207 --> 22:57.084
and make a stand in the east.

22:57.751 --> 23:02.673
To build up a new army,
and to use that army to fight Caesar.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.471
<i>Pompey asks his legions,</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:12.099
<i>scattered across Asia
and the Mediterranean,</i>

23:12.349 --> 23:13.726
<i>to meet him in Greece.</i>

23:14.935 --> 23:18.063
<i>while forcing each senator,
including Brutus,</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:20.524
<i>to choose a side in this civil war.</i>

23:33.871 --> 23:35.289
You don't think I should go.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.042
Why do you say that?

23:39.501 --> 23:40.753
This isn't personal.

23:41.337 --> 23:45.257
Pompey has the support of the Senate,
the clear military advantage... leave us.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.599
This is the right move.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.061
Are you asking?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.858
Pompey is the better choice.

24:04.068 --> 24:06.028
And even if Caesar wins,

24:06.737 --> 24:07.780
he won't hurt you.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.366
Trust yourself.

24:12.910 --> 24:13.744
I should go.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.626
Be careful.

24:40.854 --> 24:43.983
<i>On the 17th of January, 49 B.C.,</i>

24:45.150 --> 24:48.153
Pompey and most of the Senate
abandon Rome,

24:49.780 --> 24:52.074
<i>leaving the capital without a government.</i>

24:54.576 --> 24:56.537
Nobody was in charge in the city.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.666
The Senate was in shambles,
no assemblies were being called.

25:01.709 --> 25:06.714
Street gangs were essentially
in control of large portions of the city.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.135
<i>With the city in chaos,</i>

25:11.635 --> 25:14.388
<i>Caesar could easily take control of Rome.</i>

25:17.474 --> 25:20.185
<i>and that's exactly what Pompey
wants him to do.</i>

25:28.235 --> 25:31.238
He's taking this route to Brundisium.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.657
That's where he'll set sail for Greece.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.075
What about Rome?

25:35.784 --> 25:37.494
We can deal with Rome later.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.873
He's left the city wide open,
we should take it now, while we still can.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.291
Rome's not the priority.

25:43.792 --> 25:45.878
Stopping Pompey from reaching his armies.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.880
That's the priority.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.717
We'll march through the night
to make up time.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.926
Then we'll cut through here...

25:53.010 --> 25:55.804
But if we take Rome,
we can fortify the city limits.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.014
Block him out.

25:57.389 --> 26:01.810
If Pompey reaches Greece,
he'll strengthen his forces tenfold.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.439
Rome can't be defended
against an army of that size.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.359
We're changing course to Brundisium...

26:10.319 --> 26:11.153
now.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.866
Break camp, we're on the move!

26:17.576 --> 26:18.660
On your feet!

26:23.791 --> 26:25.751
<i>While the city is unguarded,</i>

26:27.044 --> 26:32.091
<i>Caesar understands that taking Rome
is not as important as stopping Pompey.</i>

26:47.564 --> 26:50.275
<i>Pompey and the Senate are traveling
to Brundisium,</i>

26:50.359 --> 26:52.486
<i>a port city in southern Italy.</i>

26:55.447 --> 26:59.034
<i>When they arrive, they'll sail to Greece,
to build up their army.</i>

27:00.619 --> 27:04.164
<i>If Caesar and his men can get
to Brundisium first,</i>

27:04.373 --> 27:07.584
<i>Pompey will be forced
to fight or surrender.</i>

27:10.587 --> 27:15.425
<i>But the challenge is enormous,
as Pompey has a head start of 200 miles.</i>

27:17.094 --> 27:21.515
<i>To close the gap, Caesar's men will need
to march at an unforgiving pace.</i>

27:24.351 --> 27:27.271
Caesar is a very bold leader.

27:27.813 --> 27:32.776
His hallmark is speed, he always wants
to get his army there first.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.779
He's constantly pushing.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.868
As a general, Caesar will be
where you don't want him to be.

27:41.118 --> 27:43.871
He seems to have
limitless amounts of energy.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.377
<i>As they reach Corfinium,</i>

27:51.128 --> 27:54.548
<i>Caesar and his army trail Pompey
by just 30 miles.</i>

28:21.825 --> 28:23.535
<i>After three months of marching,</i>

28:24.661 --> 28:27.247
<i>Caesar and his men arrive in Brundisium.</i>

28:30.709 --> 28:31.960
<i>But they're too late.</i>

28:48.644 --> 28:50.187
<i>Pompey has slipped away.</i>

28:53.148 --> 28:54.983
<i>But Caesar refuses to give up.</i>

29:01.657 --> 29:04.618
<i>So he orders his men
to begin building ships.</i>

29:06.036 --> 29:07.412
What's the latest estimate?

29:07.496 --> 29:08.497
Two months.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.500
- It's not good enough.
- The men are working as fast as they can.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.876
We don't have two months.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.253
We can only push them so hard.

29:15.045 --> 29:15.963
Ships take time.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.257
Trust me, you'll want them built right.

29:20.634 --> 29:21.635
Just get it done.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.272
One! Two!

29:33.355 --> 29:34.481
Three!

29:36.191 --> 29:39.278
One! Two! Three!

29:42.781 --> 29:45.033
<i>While Caesar constructs his fleet,</i>

29:46.201 --> 29:47.536
<i>Pompey builds an army,</i>

29:50.956 --> 29:53.959
<i>as troops from Asia and Syria
arrive in Greece</i>

29:54.042 --> 29:56.211
<i>to fight for their celebrated leader.</i>

30:01.174 --> 30:02.968
Pompey has at his disposal

30:03.218 --> 30:06.930
these men who have all
personally pledged to Pompey

30:07.014 --> 30:08.682
that if he should come calling,

30:08.765 --> 30:12.019
that they will raise men, money,
material, whatever.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.730
He will be able to call essentially
on the resources

30:14.813 --> 30:18.900
of the entire eastern Mediterranean
to battle against Caesar.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.281
<i>Back in Brundisium,</i>

30:25.741 --> 30:28.994
<i>Caesar's men have been building ships
for nearly two months,</i>

30:30.662 --> 30:33.665
<i>but they've only built enough
to carry half his army.</i>

30:35.959 --> 30:38.712
<i>And Caesar realizes time is running out.</i>

30:42.049 --> 30:45.344
Caesar knows that he needs
to push the envelope,

30:45.427 --> 30:48.972
knows that if he lets Pompey go on
for much longer, that...

30:49.389 --> 30:52.601
those forces arrayed against him
will just get bigger and bigger.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.398
<i>Leaving Mark Antony
to finish the fleet,</i>

30:59.775 --> 31:01.485
<i>Caesar sets off for Greece</i>

31:02.110 --> 31:03.904
<i>with only half his troops.</i>

31:05.947 --> 31:09.493
When Caesar left Italy
to go over to Greece,

31:09.576 --> 31:12.079
this left him dangerously exposed.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.247
Probably he should not have done it.

31:15.457 --> 31:17.334
But Caesar needs to force this battle.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.096
<i>After two days,</i>

31:30.263 --> 31:33.809
<i>Caesar and his army of 11,000 men
arrive in Greece</i>

31:35.143 --> 31:36.937
<i>and begin preparing for battle.</i>

31:38.271 --> 31:40.023
<i>But Caesar quickly realizes</i>

31:41.691 --> 31:44.694
<i>that Pompey's army is far greater
than he imagined.</i>

31:47.572 --> 31:49.908
<i>A force four times the size of his,</i>

31:52.452 --> 31:55.038
<i>that grows larger and stronger each day.</i>

32:00.710 --> 32:03.839
We'll blockade here, then through here.
Cut their supply lines,

32:04.381 --> 32:05.465
then starve them out.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.260
- Thoughts?
- Good work.

32:11.012 --> 32:11.847
Sir...

32:13.348 --> 32:14.850
Caesar's forces have been spotted.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.728
Caesar's here?

32:19.187 --> 32:21.731
Their camp is just beyond the ridge line,
less than a mile away.

32:23.150 --> 32:23.984
How many men?

32:24.568 --> 32:26.736
Scout's estimate was only half
what we expected.

32:37.038 --> 32:37.956
What do we do now?

32:40.417 --> 32:42.169
Send the scouts to track them down.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.628
Yes sir.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.217
Go.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.102
<i>While Pompey may have
the larger army,</i>

32:59.978 --> 33:03.356
<i>he knows what Caesar's achieved
against greater odds.</i>

33:05.358 --> 33:07.444
Pompey has the numerical advantage

33:08.028 --> 33:12.407
but even then, he doesn't necessarily want
to fight a battle with Caesar.

33:13.074 --> 33:17.162
It had been quite a long time since Pompey
had actually led troops in battle.

33:24.252 --> 33:27.797
<i>Pompey arranges a meeting
to convince Caesar not to fight.</i>

33:32.344 --> 33:36.848
<i>It's been ten years since these former
friends and partners have seen each other.</i>

34:00.372 --> 34:01.456
It's good to see you,

34:03.250 --> 34:05.460
though I wish it were under
different circumstances.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.714
I never congratulated you on Gaul.

34:11.675 --> 34:12.717
I was impressed.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.931
I assume you called me here
to negotiate a truce?

34:18.014 --> 34:19.641
I called you here as a courtesy.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.936
To offer you a way out.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.606
Disband your armies
and drop the all the charges,

34:27.565 --> 34:29.317
and I'll tell my men to stand down.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.654
Why would I do that?

34:32.737 --> 34:33.947
Because you're afraid.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.951
You're afraid your men aren't ready...

34:40.453 --> 34:42.706
afraid you're not as sharp
as you used to be.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.500
And that's why you called me here.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.379
Your men are better trained.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.717
But they don't stand a chance
against the size of my army.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.386
So what's your offer?

35:00.056 --> 35:03.893
Order your men to lay down their arms
and surrender themselves to my legions.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.563
Then you'll return to Rome to face trial.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.107
I'll make sure the courts
are lenient on you,

35:09.190 --> 35:10.817
but you'll never hold office again.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.447
Or you can die on the battlefield
alongside your men...

35:18.283 --> 35:19.326
the choice is yours.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.289
I'll need a day or two to think it over.

35:24.372 --> 35:27.042
So you can wait
for the rest of your forces to arrive?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.298
Consider my offer.

35:37.802 --> 35:38.845
My grandchild...

35:42.557 --> 35:45.310
a boy... or girl?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.188
It was a boy.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.922
<i>Caesar's forces
are more battle tested,</i>

36:14.964 --> 36:16.466
<i>but with only half an army,</i>

36:17.217 --> 36:19.219
<i>he stands little chance of victory.</i>

36:21.888 --> 36:22.722
Any word?

36:23.056 --> 36:23.890
Not yet.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.103
There was really good reason to think

36:28.186 --> 36:31.189
that Pompey would be able to not just
outnumber Caesar,

36:31.272 --> 36:33.358
but massively outnumber Caesar.

36:33.942 --> 36:37.987
Whatever couple of legions Caesar has
will never be able to withstand that.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.421
<i>Caesar is facing certain death</i>

36:56.464 --> 36:59.426
<i>when Mark Antony finally arrives
in Greece.</i>

37:04.681 --> 37:06.182
Caesar was a brilliant general.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.811
But it wasn't until Mark Antony was able

37:09.894 --> 37:13.481
to successfully ferry the other half
of the army over to Greece,

37:13.565 --> 37:17.569
that Caesar even stood any chance
of facing off Pompey.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.455
Send the weakest to the front.

37:29.289 --> 37:31.166
Keep the more experienced in reserve.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.335
Caesar's forces just arrived.

37:36.838 --> 37:37.714
The rest of them.

37:52.353 --> 37:53.188
It's fine.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.233
I want Caesar confident.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.903
That makes him predictable.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.407
Where do you have our cavalry?

38:05.074 --> 38:05.909
Divided...

38:06.826 --> 38:07.952
along the flanks.

38:10.747 --> 38:11.581
Good.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.333
<i>Even with a full army,</i>

38:13.666 --> 38:16.878
<i>Pompey still has a two to one advantage
over Caesar.</i>

38:20.548 --> 38:23.176
His infantry is here, here, and here.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.093
How many?

38:24.260 --> 38:26.638
Four legions at the front.
Three more on either side.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.973
He'll try to divide our ranks
or surround us.

38:31.476 --> 38:34.437
<i>Outnumbered, Caesar comes up
with a strategy</i>

38:34.521 --> 38:36.606
<i>to help defeat Pompey's men.</i>

38:37.941 --> 38:40.193
His cavalry is divided
along the perimeter,

38:41.319 --> 38:42.278
so keep an eye on them.

38:48.451 --> 38:51.788
<i>It's been over a year
since Caesar crossed the Rubicon.</i>

38:52.413 --> 38:53.248
<i>And now,</i>

38:53.456 --> 38:57.669
<i>he's about to face his greatest rival
on the battlefield.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:11.057
Today,

39:11.850 --> 39:13.309
we face an army of traitors,

39:14.519 --> 39:16.020
driven by greed

39:16.855 --> 39:17.689
and power.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.193
You are here to defend the Republic.

39:23.736 --> 39:27.699
You are here to fight
for the future of Rome.

39:31.661 --> 39:32.704
We...

39:33.955 --> 39:35.415
will overpower their ranks,

39:36.749 --> 39:38.501
we will destroy their forces,

39:39.878 --> 39:41.087
and when we are done,

39:42.589 --> 39:45.592
not a single one of them
will be left standing.

39:50.638 --> 39:52.307
I accept no other outcome...

39:55.560 --> 39:57.353
only victory!

40:13.953 --> 40:15.747
Pompey and Caesar

40:15.830 --> 40:20.001
are two of the greatest generals
in Roman history,

40:20.460 --> 40:23.004
and they were now facing each other.

40:23.838 --> 40:28.217
So, you're looking at two titans
really squaring off,

40:28.968 --> 40:31.930
and deciding the fate
of the Roman Republic.

40:33.848 --> 40:37.101
<i>The winner will be named
Rome's greatest general,</i>

40:37.769 --> 40:40.313
<i>and the ruler of what will one day become</i>

40:40.897 --> 40:43.483
<i>the world's most powerful empire.</i>

40:44.609 --> 40:46.611
First ranks, charge!

40:53.034 --> 40:54.077
Charge!

40:54.160 --> 40:55.995
Charge!

40:56.305 --> 41:02.440
