WEBVTT

00:11.833 --> 00:16.167
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...
(Richard) WHO'S MARK?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.833
DEREK FOUND US
IN BED TOGETHER.

00:18.867 --> 00:19.867
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH ME.

00:19.900 --> 00:22.733
I'M WELL OFF, BUT I'M NOT
INTO MONEY, AND I'M HOT.

00:22.767 --> 00:25.367
I'M A CATCH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU
CAN WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND

00:25.400 --> 00:28.467
THE ENLARGED, FAILING HEART
AND THE DEPENDENCY TO I.V. MEDS.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.367
I'M NOT READY FOR US
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.
I'LL BE OUT IN AN HOUR.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.200
(Izzie) AN HOUR AGO,
HE WAS PROPOSING.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.133
ARE YOU GONNA TELL SHEPHERD
ABOUT...

00:35.167 --> 00:37.733
(Preston) NOT YET.
(Meredith) IF I HAVEN'T
MADE A DECISION

00:37.767 --> 00:39.833
BY THE END OF THE DAY,
I'M FLIPPING A COIN.

00:39.867 --> 00:42.033
A GIRL CAN ONLY HOLD OUT
FOR SO LONG.

00:43.700 --> 00:47.633
***

00:49.800 --> 00:53.200
(Meredith) AT SOME POINT
DURING SURGICAL RESIDENCY,

00:53.233 --> 00:56.100
MOST INTERNS GET A SENSE
OF WHO THEY ARE AS DOCTORS

00:56.133 --> 00:58.833
AND THE KINDS OF SURGEONS
THEY'RE GOING TO BECOME.

00:58.867 --> 01:01.333
IF YOU ASK THEM,
THEY'LL TELL YOU--

01:01.367 --> 01:04.067
THEY'RE GOING
TO BE GENERAL SURGEONS...

01:04.100 --> 01:06.267
ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS...

01:06.300 --> 01:08.633
NEUROSURGEONS...

01:08.667 --> 01:10.600
DISTINCTIONS WHICH DO MORE

01:10.633 --> 01:12.667
THAN DESCRIBE THEIR AREAS
OF EXPERTISE.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.600
THEY HELP DEFINE WHO THEY ARE.

01:14.633 --> 01:17.200
BECAUSE OUTSIDE
THE OPERATING ROOM,

01:17.233 --> 01:20.133
NOT ONLY DO MOST SURGEONS
HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE,

01:20.167 --> 01:22.767
THEY'RE AFRAID TO FIND OUT.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.567
***

01:28.067 --> 01:29.267
TIME ME.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.533
I'VE BEEN TIMING YOU.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.633
MY LAST TIME WAS OFF
BY SIX SECONDS.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.567
WELL, IT'S NOT ABOUT SPEED,
IT'S ABOUT ACCURACY.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.400
I MEAN,
YOUR SUTURES ARE FINE.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.567
MY SUTURES ARE TEXTBOOK.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.567
THE EDGES
ARE PERFECTLY ALIGNED.
MM-HMM. YOU'RE READY.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.267
I NEED MORE CHICKENS.

01:44.300 --> 01:45.800
NO MORE CHICKENS, OKAY?

01:45.833 --> 01:47.733
IT'S BAD ENOUGH THAT MEREDITH
IS DATING A VET.

01:47.767 --> 01:49.467
I'M NOT DATING
A CHICKEN SURGEON.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.167
STOP SECOND-GUESSING.
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.367
YOUR HAND IS FINE, AND SHEPHERD
WILL CLEAR YOU FOR SURGERY.

01:59.767 --> 02:01.367
CRISTINA.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.367
YEAH, BABY?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.267
NOTHING.

02:06.300 --> 02:08.300
OKAY.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.100
***

02:17.767 --> 02:19.767
(George) SO IZZIE LEFT
THE HOUSE THIS MORNING.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.433
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.633
I'M JUST NOT FEELING
LIKE MYSELF.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.700
O'MALLEY SEEMS TO HAVE
THAT AFFECT ON WOMEN.

02:25.733 --> 02:27.267
ASK DR. TORRES.

02:27.300 --> 02:28.333
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

02:28.367 --> 02:30.433
DUDE... (chuckles) YOU
THREW HER OUT ON HER ASS.

02:30.467 --> 02:32.300
I DID NOT.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

02:32.333 --> 02:34.200
TORRES.

02:34.233 --> 02:35.767
OH...

02:35.800 --> 02:37.267
DON'T WORRY. I GET IT.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.200
SHE'S HOT,
BUT SHE'S NOT FOR YOU.
WHY IS THAT?

02:39.233 --> 02:40.700
BECAUSE SHE'S HOT.

02:40.733 --> 02:41.767
MM.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.500
(George) CALLIE.
MNH-MNH.

02:43.533 --> 02:44.667
HEY, COME ON. WAIT.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.767
BEFORE YOU START YELLING,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.667
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HOW
I FELT ABOUT YOU MOVING IN,

02:49.700 --> 02:52.233
NOT THAT YOU WERE MOVING IN.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.667
IT'S JUST, I'M NOT GOOD
AT THE WHOLE...

02:54.700 --> 02:57.067
"TALKING ABOUT FEELINGS"
THING.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.200
I BET YOU TOLD MEREDITH HOW
YOU FELT, THOUGH, DIDN'T YOU?

02:59.233 --> 03:01.133
AND IZZIE--
YOU DON'T SEEM TO HAVE

03:01.167 --> 03:03.400
ANY TROUBLE TALKING
TO THEM, GEORGE, BUT ME--
(Miranda) LET'S GO, PEOPLE.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.233
I'VE BEEN IN SURGERY SINCE
2:00 A.M. I'M IN NO MOOD.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.067
(Meredith whispers) GEORGE.

03:09.233 --> 03:11.467
I MISS YOU.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.367
(Cristina) NO CUTTING.
NO CUTTING.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.300
YANG, YOU'RE LATE!
HEY, I GOT HERE
BEFORE GEORGE.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.100
I'M HERE. I WAS HERE.

03:20.133 --> 03:22.233
NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US, YANG.
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING ABOUT?

03:22.267 --> 03:24.233
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE GYNIE BRIGADE?
YEAH, WHATEVER.

03:24.267 --> 03:25.733
WOMAN TROUBLES?

03:25.767 --> 03:27.833
OH. MEN TROUBLES.

03:27.867 --> 03:30.733
I THINK THIS DATING TWO GUYS
THING IS GETTING TO ME,

03:30.767 --> 03:32.133
THE STRESS OF IT.

03:32.167 --> 03:33.633
FINN, DEREK, DEREK, FINN.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.400
I THINK I'M GETTING
AN ULCER.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.533
McDREAMY AND THE VET
ARE MAKING YOU SICK?

03:37.567 --> 03:39.667
I JUST NEED TO MAKE A CHOICE
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.367
SHAWN SULLIVAN, 62,

03:41.400 --> 03:43.300
HAD MINIMALLY INVASIVE
BYPASS SURGERY TWO DAYS AGO

03:43.333 --> 03:44.467
TO REMOVE A BLOCKAGE
FROM HIS L.A.D.--

03:44.500 --> 03:46.167
BUT I'M ALL BETTER NOW.
THANK YOU, GEORGE.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.700
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MIRANDA?
CAN I STOP BEING A BURDEN

03:48.733 --> 03:51.067
TO YOU GOOD PEOPLE
AND GO ON HOME?

03:51.100 --> 03:53.300
YOU NEED TO STOP INTERRUPTING
THE DOCTORS, SHAWNY.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.067
YOU JUST NEED TO LISTEN
TO WHAT THEY SAY.
I NEED TO GET BACK
TO THE DEALERSHIP.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.400
THEY'RE GONNA CAN ME
IF I'M OUT TOO LONG.
THEY CAN'T CAN YOU, SWEETIE.

03:58.433 --> 04:00.800
YOU'RE THE BEST SALESMAN
THEY GOT. COME ON.
(Miranda) WHAT DO YOU SELL?

04:00.833 --> 04:02.233
CARS.

04:02.267 --> 04:04.700
MY SHAWNY COULD SELL...
ANYTHING.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.667
YEAH, I BELIEVE HE CAN.
WHAT HE CAN'T SELL ME ON

04:06.700 --> 04:09.567
IS GOING BACK TO WORK BEFORE
HE GETS HIS OXYGEN LEVELS UP.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.767
SO YOU PUT THAT OXYGEN
BACK ON, MR. SULLIVAN,

04:11.800 --> 04:14.133
BEFORE I EVEN THINK ABOUT
LETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.

04:14.167 --> 04:16.633
YOU KNOW, AND IF I DO,
I WANT YOUR WORD--

04:16.667 --> 04:19.767
NOTHING FRIED, NO ALCOHOL
AND NO CIGARETTES.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.100
BOY, YOU'RE TOUGH, MIRANDA.

04:22.133 --> 04:24.067
I NEED YOUR WORD, MR. SULLIVAN,
OR I'M NOT GONNA SIGN

04:24.100 --> 04:25.833
THOSE DISCHARGE PAPERS.
I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

04:25.867 --> 04:28.367
HMM. ALL RIGHT, THEN.
MRS. SULLIVAN, YOU NEED TO GO

04:28.400 --> 04:31.400
TO THE FRONT DESK
TO FILL OUT SOME PAPERWORK,

04:31.433 --> 04:33.333
AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE
YOUR HUSBAND HOME.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.267
(Addison)
HOW ARE WE DOING, GUYS?

04:35.300 --> 04:36.467
SHE'S AT 8 CENTIMETERS,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.400
BUT THE BABY'S
STILL AT MINUS 3 STATION.

04:38.433 --> 04:41.667
SO WHAT DO WE DO, UH,
PATTERNED BREATHING, SQUATTING?

04:41.700 --> 04:43.533
DUDE, SQUATTING?
DR. KAREV,

04:43.567 --> 04:46.633
HOW DO WE NORMALLY PROCEED
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS?

04:46.667 --> 04:48.367
WE MONITOR
THE BABY'S PROGRESS.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.200
IF THE DESCENT STOPS ENTIRELY
DURING ACTIVE LABOR,

04:51.233 --> 04:52.400
WE PERFORM A C-SECTION.

04:52.433 --> 04:53.700
NOT ON ME, YOU DON'T.

04:53.733 --> 04:55.300
I'M SORRY, DR. KAREV,

04:55.333 --> 04:57.567
BUT JEFF AND I HAVE
A NATURAL BIRTH PLAN,

04:57.600 --> 04:59.500
AND DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD
PROMISED US THAT--

04:59.533 --> 05:01.767
I PROMISED THAT WE WOULD
DO WHAT WE CAN,

05:01.800 --> 05:05.167
BUT IF YOUR LABOR INTENSIFIES
AND THE BABY DOESN'T DESCEND--

05:05.200 --> 05:08.233
WELL, THEN WE'LL WAIT
UNTIL HE DOES, RIGHT?

05:08.267 --> 05:09.833
I'M NOT HAVING A C-SECTION.

05:09.867 --> 05:12.633
A C-SECTION IS ACTUALLY
THE SAFEST WAY--

05:12.667 --> 05:13.867
TO WHAT, AVOID A LAWSUIT?

05:13.900 --> 05:16.433
WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE
RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT GONNA MISS OUT

05:16.467 --> 05:19.133
ON AN EXPERIENCE
THAT MY BODY WAS MADE FOR

05:19.167 --> 05:21.333
JUST BECAUSE IT'S
MORE CONVENIENT FOR YOU.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.167
YOU ALL RIGHT, DR. GREY?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.100
YEAH, DR. BAILEY.

05:28.133 --> 05:30.267
I JUST...

05:30.300 --> 05:31.767
OH.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.567
***

05:34.600 --> 05:36.500
NEED TO MAKE A CHOICE IS ALL.

05:36.533 --> 05:40.367
KAREV. DR. GREY, I AM CLIPPING
A BASILAR TIP ANEURYSM.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.433
ANY INTEREST?

05:47.867 --> 05:49.733
DR. BAILEY, CAN I GET...

05:49.767 --> 05:52.733
***

05:52.767 --> 05:55.067
OH, MY GOD.

06:00.067 --> 06:03.600
OH... MY... GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.267
IS THAT...
McSTEAMY.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.133
***

06:07.167 --> 06:08.400
(retches)

06:10.233 --> 06:13.067
NO, MR. SULLIVAN,
DON'T LIGHT THAT!

06:17.767 --> 06:19.600
(Derek) SOMEBODY GET
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

06:19.633 --> 06:26.133
(Miranda) CALL A CODE RED.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.567
MAKE SURE HE HAS AN AIRWAY.
SIR, CAN YOU HEAR ME? SIR?

06:30.600 --> 06:32.400
NO, HE'S OUT.
HIT HIS HEAD.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.333
SMALL HEMATOMA
IN THE OCCIPITAL REGION.

06:34.367 --> 06:36.267
GET HIM TO THE BURN UNIT
TILL HE'S STABILIZED,

06:36.300 --> 06:37.433
AND THEN GET A C.T.

06:37.467 --> 06:38.700
GO.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.733
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.
COME ON.

06:42.833 --> 06:44.167
YOU'RE BURNING UP.
I'M FINE.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
YOU DON'T LOOK FINE.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.633
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK FINE.

06:47.667 --> 06:48.833
NOW I'M GONNA THROW UP.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.800
GO, YOU HAVE ANEURYSMS
TO CLIP

06:50.833 --> 06:53.500
AND SURGEONS TO CONFRONT.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.567
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.067
WILL YOU LOOK AFTER HER,
PLEASE?
MM-HMM.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.433
YOU THINK I'D MISS THIS?
WHAT KIND OF IDIOT LIGHTS
A CIGARETTE IN A HOSPITAL?

07:01.467 --> 07:03.433
APPARENTLY PEOPLE DO
IDIOTIC THINGS ALL THE TIME.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.667
(elevator bell dings)

07:07.233 --> 07:09.133
(Derek) CHIEF.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.267
CHIEF.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.133
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
BACK TO NEW YORK.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.800
I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME
FOR A CHANGE.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.567
YOU CAN'T BE HERE.
SURE I CAN.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.767
IT WAS EASY.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.333
SUBLET THE APARTMENT,
SOLD THE PRACTICE.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.500
(Derek) HE IS A LIAR
AND A CHEAT.
THE MAN IS ONE OF

07:24.533 --> 07:26.300
THE FINEST PLASTIC SURGEONS
IN THIS COUNTRY.

07:26.333 --> 07:27.700
HIS DEPARTMENT WILL GENERATE

07:27.733 --> 07:30.533
TWICE THE REVENUE
NEUROSURGERY DOES.
MONEY, THAT'S WHY HE'S HERE?

07:30.567 --> 07:32.467
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M HERE?
THIS? THIS IS WHY
I LEFT YOU.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.733
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT ME
FOR DEREK.

07:34.767 --> 07:36.233
I LEFT NEW YORK
BECAUSE OF HIM.

07:36.267 --> 07:39.133
HE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND
FOR YEARS.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.733
RIGHT UP UNTIL THE POINT
WHERE HE HAD SEX WITH MY WIFE.
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

07:41.767 --> 07:42.700
OH.

07:42.733 --> 07:43.667
(retches)

07:43.700 --> 07:45.500
HOLY CRAP! ARE YOU PREGNANT?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.467
(Meredith vomits)

07:50.367 --> 07:51.300
(Meredith vomits)

07:51.333 --> 07:53.467
OH, THIS IS JUST PERFECT...

07:55.100 --> 07:57.067
AN ADULTEROUS LOVE CHILD.

07:57.067 --> 07:59.467
GOES ALONG WITH
AN ADULTEROUS SOCIOPATH.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.500
(Derek) MEREDITH.

08:03.533 --> 08:04.700
UNH-UNH.
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH ALREADY.

08:04.733 --> 08:06.400
(Derek) MEREDITH.

08:06.433 --> 08:09.300
OH, UH, DOCTOR, I-I FINISHED
FILLING OUT THE PAPERWORK.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.600
WHEN DO YOU THINK I CAN
TAKE SHAWNY HOME?

08:11.633 --> 08:13.600
UM...

08:17.300 --> 08:19.167
SO WHO'S THE FATHER?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.067
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.700
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS PREGNANT.
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT, EITHER.

08:23.733 --> 08:25.767
BUT THE ABDOMINAL PAIN, FEVER
AND THE NONSTOP VOMITING--
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.233
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
THE FATHER IS, DO YOU?

08:28.267 --> 08:30.167
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DEREK'S.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.567
THERE'S NO WAY
IT COULD BE FINN'S.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.733
YOU HAVEN'T HAD SEX
WITH THE VET YET?

08:34.767 --> 08:37.200
(scoffs) WELL, YOU GOTTA GET
OUTTA THAT RELATIONSHIP,

08:37.233 --> 08:38.167
IMMEDIATELY.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.600
OH, I CAN'T BE PREGNANT,
CAN I?

08:39.633 --> 08:41.267
WITH McBABY.
OH!

08:41.300 --> 08:43.233
OH, OKAY.
WAS I THIS MEAN TO YOU
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT?

08:43.267 --> 08:45.167
OH, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T PREGNANT.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.800
SHE'S NOT.
WE'LL HAVE TO RUN MORE TESTS.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.267
IN THAT CASE,
CAN I HAVE SOME MORPHINE?

08:50.300 --> 08:53.467
(groans)

08:53.500 --> 08:55.400
I WANT YOU CHECKING
THE FETAL MONITOR

08:55.433 --> 08:57.333
EVERY 30 MINUTES.
WHAT'S THE POINT?

08:57.367 --> 08:59.267
THE BABY'S NOWHERE NEAR
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE,

08:59.300 --> 09:01.200
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO CUT HER OPEN,

09:01.233 --> 09:04.100
SO WHY NOT GET IT OVER WITH?
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT
THE PATIENT WANTS.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.067
AND IT'S OUR JOB AS DOCTORS

09:06.067 --> 09:07.800
TO BALANCE THE DESIRES
OF THE PATIENT

09:07.833 --> 09:09.300
AGAINST THE RISK
OF COMPLICATIONS.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.400
SO IF THE PATIENT WANTS
TO HAVE A NATURAL BIRTH--
SO IF THE PATIENT WANTS

09:11.433 --> 09:13.067
A NATURAL BIRTH,
IT'S NOT SURGICAL.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.267
SO WHY NOT JUST CUT ME LOOSE
AND LET ME IN ON A SURGERY?

09:15.300 --> 09:17.167
I MIGHT ACTUALLY LEARN
SOMETHING.
LIKE SLOAN'S BURN CASE.

09:17.200 --> 09:18.700
I'M GOING INTO PLASTICS
ANYWAY.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.633
DO YOU THINK THAT MARK SLOAN
HAS ANYTHING TO TEACH YOU?

09:20.667 --> 09:23.267
HE IS JUST LIKE YOU. HE IS
ONLY LOOKING OUT FOR HIMSELF.

09:23.300 --> 09:24.500
SO WHAT? YOUR PATIENT'S
LOOKING OUT FOR HERSELF,

09:24.533 --> 09:27.600
YOU'RE LOOKING OUT
FOR YOURSELF--
NO, I'M NOT, ACTUALLY.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.400
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE.

09:30.867 --> 09:33.267
GO. GO FIND SLOAN.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.300
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. JUST GET
OUT OF MY FACE, KAREV. GO!

09:39.867 --> 09:43.067
(sighs)

09:43.100 --> 09:44.833
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SAYING
HE'S A BAD DOCTOR.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.500
OF COURSE NOT. LISTEN--

09:46.533 --> 09:48.700
I'M--I'M SAYING THAT HE'S,
LIKE, A BAD PERSON.

09:48.733 --> 09:50.633
THE MAN HAS NO MORALITY,
NO ETHICS.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.567
YEAH. BUT THERE'S NO PAIN,
THERE'S NO NUMBNESS, BUT, UM--

09:52.600 --> 09:55.233
I MEAN, THE QUESTION IS
DO WE REALLY WANT OUR INTERNS

09:55.267 --> 09:57.400
LEARNING FROM
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT?
DEREK, MY ARM.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.067
YEAH. OH, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GREAT.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.667
YOU HAVE GREAT RANGE OF MOTION.
I CAN CLEAR YOU FOR SURGERY.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.067
REALLY? YOU'RE SURE?

10:03.100 --> 10:05.733
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
COMPLETE RECOVERY.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.600
YOU'RE NOT HAVING
ANY PROBLEMS, RIGHT?

10:07.633 --> 10:10.533
NO. UH... I-I'VE BEEN DOING
HIS PHYSICAL THERAPY WITH HIM

10:10.567 --> 10:11.600
EVERY NIGHT, SO...

10:11.633 --> 10:13.733
HE'S PERFECT. HE'S BURKE.

10:13.767 --> 10:16.067
GOOD. GLAD TO HEAR IT.
WELCOME BACK, DR. BURKE.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.267
YEAH.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.467
UH, DR. BAILEY WANTED TO KNOW
IF YOU STILL NEEDED AN INTERN?

10:19.500 --> 10:22.067
NO, I'M FINE.
HOW'S, UH, DR. GREY?

10:22.100 --> 10:24.733
OH, SHE'S NOT PREGNANT
WITH ANYONE'S BABY, SO...

10:24.767 --> 10:26.133
(chuckles)

10:26.167 --> 10:28.000
(whispers) YEAH.

10:29.833 --> 10:32.400
(door closes)

10:32.433 --> 10:35.100
(sighs)

10:38.333 --> 10:41.267
IZZIE...
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.533
YOU WANT SOME LUNCH?

10:43.567 --> 10:45.767
I'M MEETING SOMEBODY.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.100
ANYBODY I KNOW?

10:47.133 --> 10:49.333
ACTUALLY,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.800
YOU NEVER MET?
KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE?

10:51.833 --> 10:53.767
SO FOR ALL YOU KNOW,

10:53.800 --> 10:58.467
HE COULD BE AN OLDER, RUGGED,
EX-MARINE-LOOKING DUDE?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.133
DR. STEVENS?

11:04.167 --> 11:06.333
MR. DUQUETTE.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.200
PLEASE...

11:08.233 --> 11:10.533
CALL ME DENNY.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.800
YOU'RE A VERY PRETTY GIRL.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.800
NOT DENNY'S TYPE AT ALL.

11:22.833 --> 11:25.267
REALLY?

11:25.300 --> 11:27.133
WHAT WAS HIS TYPE?

11:27.167 --> 11:28.633
UM...

11:28.667 --> 11:30.567
DARK-HAIRED GIRLS, SMART.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.800
UH... WELL, NOT THAT
YOU'RE NOT SMART.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.833
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.333
OBVIOUSLY--
I WAS.

11:37.367 --> 11:39.700
I WAS A DOCTOR.
I'M NOT ANYMORE.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.367
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
DR. WEBBER SAID YOU'D QUIT.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.767
YOU...
TALKED TO DR. WEBBER?

11:45.800 --> 11:47.733
UH, YES,
AND HE SAID THAT, WELL,

11:47.767 --> 11:50.167
IF I WANTED TO HEAR THE WHOLE
STORY, I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.533
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND,
DR. STEVENS--

11:51.567 --> 11:52.500
IZZIE.

11:52.533 --> 11:54.067
IZZIE...

11:54.067 --> 11:55.833
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

11:55.867 --> 11:59.067
I NEED TO HEAR
THE WHOLE STORY.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.733
DR. SLOAN.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.600
YOU MY INTERN?

12:06.633 --> 12:07.833
YEAH. UH, I'M YOUR INTERN.

12:07.867 --> 12:09.500
(Shawn) MY FACE... OH.

12:09.533 --> 12:11.267
NO NEED TO TALK,
MR. SULLIVAN.

12:11.300 --> 12:14.167
THAT'S GONNA BE PAINFUL
FOR A WHILE.
MY FACE.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.067
HE WANTS TO KNOW THAT YOU
CAN FIX HIS FACE.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.833
HE NEEDS TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN FIX IT.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.767
I'M GOING TO REMOVE
THE BURNED TISSUE

12:19.800 --> 12:22.367
AND THEN BANDAGE YOUR FACE
WITH A DRESSING OF LIVE CELLS.

12:22.400 --> 12:25.067
AND THAT'LL DO IT? HIS FACE
WILL BE BACK LIKE IT WAS?

12:25.067 --> 12:27.233
BECAUSE HIS FACE WAS--
IT'S A NICE FACE. (sobs)

12:27.267 --> 12:30.067
HE'S A SALESMAN.

12:30.067 --> 12:33.333
I'M GONNA DO ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING I CAN, MRS. SULLIVAN.

12:33.367 --> 12:35.533
WE'LL NEED A NEURO CONSULT
BEFORE WE OPERATE.

12:35.567 --> 12:38.433
ANYTHING ELSE? I MEAN, UH,
I COULD DO DEBRIDEMENT OR, UH--

12:38.467 --> 12:40.367
ACTUALLY, THERE IS
ONE MORE THING.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.533
BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO.
MAKE IT A DOUBLE.

12:45.467 --> 12:46.767
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.067
YOU ARE SO HIGH RIGHT NOW.

12:49.067 --> 12:52.633
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE WORLD.

12:52.667 --> 12:54.767
NOW I JUST FEEL SORRY
FOR YOU.
WHY?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.467
BECAUSE I COULD DIE TODAY?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.400
THIS IS WHY I HATE
BEING AROUND STONED PEOPLE.

12:58.433 --> 12:59.767
AND IF I DID DIE TODAY,

12:59.800 --> 13:02.367
I'D ONLY BE REMEMBERED
AS THE SLUTTY INTERN

13:02.400 --> 13:05.067
WHO DATED TWO DOCTORS.
NO, ONE DOCTOR, ONE VET.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.333
DEREK, FINN. DEREK OR FINN?

13:07.367 --> 13:10.233
I'D DIE AS THE GIRL WHO
COULDN'T MAKE A CHOICE, RIGHT?
PROBABLY.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.833
BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS,
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE DEAD.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.633
DR. GREY...

13:14.667 --> 13:16.767
YOU'VE GOT A FEVER,
HIGH WHITE COUNT

13:16.800 --> 13:18.533
AND TENDERNESS OVER
McBURNEY'S POINT,

13:18.567 --> 13:19.833
WHICH SUGGESTS--

13:19.867 --> 13:21.500
(George, Cristina and Meredith)
APPENDICITIS.

13:21.533 --> 13:22.833
DR. O'MALLEY,
PREP DR. GREY FOR SURGERY.

13:22.867 --> 13:24.767
YOU'RE SCRUBBING IN.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.700
I AM,
IN MEREDITH'S APPENDECTOMY?

13:25.733 --> 13:28.300
I, UH... AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO REMEMBERS

13:28.333 --> 13:30.533
THE LAST TIME GEORGE SCRUBBED IN
ON AN APPENDECTOMY?

13:30.567 --> 13:33.267
HE ALMOST KILLED THE GUY.
SORRY, GEORGE.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.800
I DON'T HAVE TO SCRUB IN,
DR. BAILEY. I COULD JUST, UH...

13:35.833 --> 13:38.100
UH... UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO,
WHICH...

13:38.133 --> 13:40.133
NO. IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.833
THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU,
DR. GREY?

13:42.867 --> 13:44.633
YOU'RE PRETTY.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.667
(sighs)

13:48.700 --> 13:50.700
GEORGE! ICE CHIPS.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.267
HEY.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.100
I, UH, HEARD MEREDITH'S
HAVING AN APPY.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.733
IT WASN'T MY IDEA TO SCRUB IN.
I TRIED TO GET OUT OF IT.

13:59.767 --> 14:01.300
GEORGE... I WAS JUST...

14:01.333 --> 14:02.633
I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE

14:02.667 --> 14:04.767
WE COULD HAVE A LATE SUPPER
AT THE ARCHFIELD.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.400
WHY WOULD WE HAVE DINNER
AT A HOTEL?

14:07.433 --> 14:09.733
BECAUSE THEY BRING IT
RIGHT TO YOUR ROOM.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.433
YOU'RE STAYING
AT THE ARCHFIELD.

14:12.467 --> 14:14.367
HOW--HOW ARE YOU
AFFORDING THAT?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.267
I STILL HAVE SOME SECRETS,
O'MALLEY.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.200
AND IF YOU
COME SEE ME TONIGHT,

14:18.233 --> 14:20.133
I JUST MIGHT SHOW YOU
ONE OR TWO.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.800
(Miranda) DR. SLOAN.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.667
I WAS JUST CHECKING
ON THE SULLIVANS,

14:23.700 --> 14:25.533
AND HOW IS HE DOING
BECAUSE HE--
YOU ARE?

14:25.567 --> 14:28.667
DR. BAILEY.
WE MET THIS MORNING.

14:28.700 --> 14:32.067
I WAS THE RESIDENT
ON MR. SULLIVAN'S BYPASS.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.233
WELL, I DON'T NEED A RESIDENT
ON THIS CASE, SO...

14:34.267 --> 14:36.167
EXCUSE ME. I WASN'T ASKING
TO BE YOUR RESIDENT.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.600
I WAS ASKING HOW MY PATIENT
WAS DOING.
HE'S NOT
YOUR PATIENT ANYMORE.

14:42.367 --> 14:45.433
HEY, SO CONGRATULATIONS.
I TOLD YOU.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.800
YEAH.

14:46.833 --> 14:49.333
WHAT? WHAT?

14:49.367 --> 14:52.233
SHEPHERD SHOULDN'T HAVE
CLEARED ME.

14:52.267 --> 14:54.600
BURKE, YOU'RE BACK.
YOU'RE BACK AND YOU'RE FINE.

14:54.633 --> 14:55.567
BURKE.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.700
WHAT?

14:56.733 --> 14:59.433
WHAT?

14:59.467 --> 15:01.600
HE JUST...

15:01.633 --> 15:04.400
SHOULDN'T HAVE CLEARED ME.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.433
(woman) ANOTHER CONTRACTION,
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.100
YOU'RE FULLY DILATED.

15:10.133 --> 15:12.567
BUT THE BABY'S
ONLY AT MINUS 2 STATION.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.567
HE JUST NEEDS MORE TIME.
WE DON'T HAVE IT, REBECCA.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.833
HIS HEART RATE'S SLOWING
WITH EACH CONTRACTION.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.100
IF HE STARTS HAVING
LATE DECELS, I--

15:19.133 --> 15:21.833
IS HE HAVING LATE DECELS?
NOT YET, BUT--

15:21.867 --> 15:23.567
THEN STOP TRYING TO SCARE ME

15:23.600 --> 15:25.500
INTO AN OPERATION
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.067
I HAVE A BIRTH PLAN.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.433
LOOK, I'M NOT--

15:28.467 --> 15:30.767
I'M NOT GONNA BE ONE OF
THOSE WEAK-ASS WOMEN

15:30.800 --> 15:33.667
WHO GIVE ALL THAT UP THE MINUTE
THINGS START TO GET SCARY.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.300
I...
REBECCA...

15:35.333 --> 15:38.067
YOUR BIRTH PLAN IS JUST THAT,
IT'S A PLAN.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.100
JEFF, GET HER OUT OF HERE.
HONEY, I THINK SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO BE CAUTIOUS.

15:41.133 --> 15:44.400
JUST GET OUT! JUST GET OUT!
GET OUT! AAH!

15:44.433 --> 15:45.800
OW! GET OUT!

15:45.833 --> 15:47.733
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

15:53.600 --> 15:57.100
SINCE WHEN DO YOU "GET OUT"?

15:57.133 --> 15:59.400
CLEARLY,
I AM NOT MYSELF TODAY.

15:59.433 --> 16:02.233
NEVER WOULD'VE FIGURED
MARK SLOAN TO BE YOUR TYPE.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.567
HE'S NOT.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.700
HE'S NOT. (sighs)

16:05.733 --> 16:08.600
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

16:08.633 --> 16:10.700
I CAN'T HAVE HIM HERE.
I CAN'T.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.367
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
IN NEW YORK. I CAN'T--

16:13.400 --> 16:15.300
I CAN'T FUNCTION
WITH HIM HERE.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.333
I'M A PROFESSIONAL HERE.
PEOPLE RESPECT ME HERE.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.267
BUT WHEN HE'S HERE,
I'M JUST--I'M--

16:19.300 --> 16:21.200
A WOMAN WHO GETS THE HOTS
FOR MAN-CANDY

16:21.233 --> 16:23.200
AND CHEATS ON HER HUSBAND.
THAT IS RUDE...

16:23.233 --> 16:25.067
AND UNKIND...

16:25.100 --> 16:26.267
AND COMPLETELY TRUE.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.200
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

16:28.233 --> 16:30.700
FOR STARTERS, YOU CAN KEEP
YOUR KNEES CLOSED

16:30.733 --> 16:32.067
IN HIS PRESENCE.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.733
MIRANDA.
YOU ASKED.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.400
AND ALSO, YOU CAN REMEMBER
THAT NO MAN--

16:36.433 --> 16:38.600
NOT DEREK, NOT MARK--

16:38.633 --> 16:42.533
DEFINES WHO YOU ARE.

16:46.233 --> 16:47.400
WELL, LET'S SEE--

16:47.433 --> 16:50.567
YOUR COMPLEXION IS FLUSHED...

16:50.600 --> 16:53.400
ABDOMINAL WALL IS TENDER.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.333
ARE YOU HAPPY YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND

16:55.367 --> 16:56.700
WHO WORKS IN A HOSPITAL?

16:56.733 --> 16:58.800
YOU... ARE JUST
ONE OF MANY MEN

16:58.833 --> 17:00.767
THAT I HAPPEN TO BE DATING
AT THE MOMENT.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.333
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.267
HOW MANY OF US ARE THERE?

17:04.300 --> 17:07.400
UH...
WELL, THERE'S, UH, YOU...

17:07.433 --> 17:08.367
MM-HMM.

17:08.400 --> 17:12.233
AND FINN AND...

17:12.267 --> 17:14.633
WELL, FORGIVE ME
FOR POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS,

17:14.667 --> 17:16.567
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY PRACTITIONERS

17:16.600 --> 17:20.367
OF VETERINARIAN MEDICINE
AT YOUR BEDSIDE.
YOU WOULD
IF YOU TURNED AROUND.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.533
AH, FINN.

17:21.567 --> 17:22.733
DEREK.

17:22.767 --> 17:25.700
OH, CAN I JUST SAY
HOW MUCH IT HELPS

17:25.733 --> 17:28.600
THAT I AM ON DRUGS
RIGHT NOW?

17:30.667 --> 17:32.300
(Derek) SO.
(Finn) SO.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.700
SO HOW'S LIFE
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM?

17:33.733 --> 17:35.567
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DEREK?
SLOW DAY?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.467
(pager beeps)

17:37.500 --> 17:40.300
IF YOU NEED TO TAKE OFF,
THAT'S--
NO, IT'S FINE. I CAN STAY.

17:40.333 --> 17:41.767
GREAT.
GREAT.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.233
GREAT.
(George) OKAY, LET'S GET YOU
PREPPED AND READY FOR...

17:45.267 --> 17:47.133
DR. SHEPHERD. DR. FINN.

17:47.167 --> 17:49.133
NOW ALL MY BOYS ARE HERE.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.833
YOU'RE ALL SO HANDSOME...

17:50.867 --> 17:52.533
AND SUCH GOOD KISSERS.

17:52.567 --> 17:55.067
OH, GOD.
EXCUSE ME?

17:55.067 --> 17:56.567
SHE'S ON DRUGS.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.567
HE'S AN EXCELLENT KISSER.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.067
YOU TWO... DATED?
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

18:01.100 --> 18:03.067
IT WASN'T A DATE SO MUCH AS

18:03.067 --> 18:06.067
A DISASTROUSLY UNCOMFORTABLE

18:06.100 --> 18:08.700
SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

18:08.733 --> 18:11.633
OH... I-I--
I CAN'T BE HERE.
NONE OF YOU CAN BE HERE.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.533
THIS WOMAN IS BEING PREPPED
FOR SURGERY,

18:13.567 --> 18:15.133
WHICH MEANS YOU ALL
NEED TO LEAVE.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.767
GLADLY.
NOW! NOT YOU, O'MALLEY.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.367
DR. BAILEY,
ALL MY BOYFRIENDS ARE HERE.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.600
NOT FOR LONG.
SAY GOOD-BYE, DR. GREY.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.733
I'LL BE HERE
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.
SO WILL I.

18:22.767 --> 18:25.533
NOW!

18:25.567 --> 18:27.533
(laughs)

18:33.367 --> 18:36.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:36.633 --> 18:38.533
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE
I'M DOING?

18:38.567 --> 18:40.133
YOU'RE NOT IN MED SCHOOL.

18:40.167 --> 18:42.700
YOU DON'T NEED TO PRACTICE
PROCEDURES ON A CORPSE.

18:42.733 --> 18:44.633
(instrument buzzes)
BETTER THAN ON A PATIENT.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.267
BURKE, YOUR HAND IS FINE.

18:46.300 --> 18:48.200
RIGHT.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.433
ARE YOU... MAD AT ME?

18:52.467 --> 18:56.067
HEY, HEY, YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.133
FORGET IT.

19:00.167 --> 19:02.067
JUST...
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.833
YOU HAVE PATIENTS.

19:03.867 --> 19:06.367
I'M ON CALL FOR THE PIT.
CRISTINA--

19:06.400 --> 19:08.067
I-I AM NOT LEAVING.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.467
TIME ME.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.833
THE TRANSPLANT WENT BETTER
THAN ANYONE EXPECTED,

19:21.867 --> 19:23.200
AND HE WAS BETTER.

19:23.233 --> 19:26.200
HE WAS... SO MUCH BETTER.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.067
BUT DENNY, UM...

19:28.067 --> 19:29.567
BEFORE THE SURGERY,

19:29.600 --> 19:31.500
HE WAS HOOKED UP
TO A MACHINE CALLED--

19:31.533 --> 19:33.700
YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING
MY QUESTION.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.200
I'M TRYING.
I-I'M GETTING THERE.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.133
IT--IT WAS COMPLICATED,
AND HIS HEART WAS--

19:37.167 --> 19:39.300
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
THE MEDICINE.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.600
I KNOW WHAT KILLED MY SON.

19:43.367 --> 19:44.700
HE HAD A BAD HEART.

19:44.733 --> 19:47.167
HE HAD A BAD HEART
FOR A LONG TIME.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.567
I GET THAT.

19:48.600 --> 19:51.067
WHAT I DON'T GET IS HOW
A GIRL LIKE YOU

19:51.067 --> 19:54.067
GOES FROM BEING MY SON'S DOCTOR
TO--TO HIS FIANCéE

19:54.100 --> 19:56.800
ON THE VERY DAY HE'S SUPPOSED
TO GET A NEW HEART.

19:56.833 --> 20:00.433
WHAT I DON'T GET IS HOW YOU
GOT HIM TO PROPOSE TO YOU

20:00.467 --> 20:02.833
HOURS BEFORE HE DIED.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.767
MR. SULLIVAN,
I'M GONNA RECOMMEND

20:04.800 --> 20:07.167
A NIGHT OF OBSERVATION
IN THE I.C.U.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.367
BEFORE DR. SLOAN PROCEEDS
WITH YOUR SURGERY.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.133
OH.
IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY,
DR. SHEPHERD?

20:12.167 --> 20:14.533
THE LONGER WE WAIT, THE HIGHER
THE RISK OF INFECTION.

20:14.567 --> 20:16.467
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE ATTEND TO

20:16.500 --> 20:18.033
POTENTIAL LIFE-THREATENING
INJURIES

20:18.067 --> 20:19.533
BEFORE MOVING ON TO COSMETIC,
DR. SLOAN.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.600
HE'S NOT HERE FOR A FACE-LIFT,
DEREK. HE'S A BURN VICTIM.

20:21.633 --> 20:24.400
WHY DID YOU ASK FOR A CONSULT
IF YOU'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED

20:24.433 --> 20:26.500
A COURSE OF ACTION?
BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOOD ENOUGH AT YOUR JOB

20:26.533 --> 20:29.500
TO PUT ASIDE THE PERSONAL AND DO
WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PATIENT.
MY JOB? YOU'RE TELLING ME
HOW TO DO MY JOB?

20:29.533 --> 20:32.700
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
HOW TO DO MY--
PLEASE, I'M SURE
IT'S COMPLICATED.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.700
AND I KNOW SHAWNY'S SORRY
FOR LIGHTING THAT SMOKE.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.533
HE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HIS WORD
TO DR. BAILEY.

20:37.567 --> 20:39.467
HE TOLD HER HE WASN'T
GONNA SMOKE WHEN HE GOT HOME,

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
AND HE WAS... JUST TRYING
TO KEEP HIS WORD.

20:41.433 --> 20:42.733
HE KNOWS HE DID WRONG.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.633
BUT HE'S...

20:45.667 --> 20:48.267
HE'S A SALESMAN.
THAT'S WHO HE IS.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.600
SO COULD YOU PLEASE
JUST FIX HIS FACE?

20:50.633 --> 20:53.633
COULD YOU DO THAT
FOR US, PLEASE?

20:58.100 --> 20:59.833
IF WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN ME AND ADDISON

20:59.867 --> 21:01.767
IS SO UNFORGIVABLE,
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND MEREDITH?

21:03.833 --> 21:06.367
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU NEED ME TO BE
THE BAD GUY? FINE.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.300
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY
BAD GUY HERE, DEREK.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.433
YOU AND ME, WE'RE THE SAME.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.233
ADDISON.

21:18.267 --> 21:21.167
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.800
YOU BELLOWED, DR. GREY.

21:23.833 --> 21:25.633
HI.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.067
YOU CERTAINLY ARE,
AREN'T YOU?

21:29.067 --> 21:30.500
(exhales)

21:30.533 --> 21:32.800
BUT YOUR NOT PREGNANT.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.733
NO.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.500
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:39.533 --> 21:41.367
FINE.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.400
HOW ARE YOU?

21:43.433 --> 21:46.800
I'M TRYING TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN TWO MEN.

21:46.833 --> 21:50.667
OKAY, WELL,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

21:50.700 --> 21:54.667
HOW DID YOU KNOW
DEREK WAS THE ONE?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.667
EXCUSE ME?

21:58.700 --> 22:01.433
I KNOW YOU HATE ME AND ALL,

22:01.467 --> 22:04.167
AND YOU DON'T
OWE ME ANYTHING.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.300
NOTHING. (sighs)

22:06.333 --> 22:10.800
NO... THING.

22:12.233 --> 22:13.567
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.067
DEREK.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.833
RIGHT.

22:16.867 --> 22:20.600
I WANT HIM TO BE THE ONE.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.500
***

22:22.533 --> 22:25.400
BUT I WOULD KNOW IF HE WAS
THE ONE, RIGHT?

22:25.433 --> 22:28.133
YOU KNEW, RIGHT? (sighs)

22:31.433 --> 22:33.667
YOU DON'T...

22:33.700 --> 22:36.067
I DIDN'T... KNOW.

22:36.067 --> 22:39.067
I JUST...

22:39.100 --> 22:42.500
DEREK'S THE KIND OF GUY...

22:42.533 --> 22:45.267
I JUST KNEW
HE WOULDN'T HURT ME.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.333
I MEAN, NOT ON PURPOSE,
ANYWAY,

22:47.367 --> 22:51.133
NOT THE WAY I HURT HIM.

22:51.167 --> 22:54.300
HE HURT ME...

22:54.333 --> 22:56.833
WHEN HE CHOSE YOU.

22:56.867 --> 22:59.233
I SHOULD'VE LET HIM GO.

22:59.267 --> 23:02.067
(sighs)
I SHOULD'VE STEPPED ASIDE,

23:02.100 --> 23:03.600
BEEN A BETTER PERSON.

23:03.633 --> 23:06.767
I... SHOULD'VE...

23:06.800 --> 23:09.733
A LOT OF THINGS.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.700
ME, TOO.

23:11.733 --> 23:14.600
A LOT OF THINGS.

23:14.633 --> 23:17.800
I DON'T HATE YOU.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.700
HOW COME WE NEVER
TALKED LIKE THIS BEFORE?

23:20.733 --> 23:24.633
THE ONLY REASON WE ARE
TALKING LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW

23:24.667 --> 23:26.567
IS BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU WON'T REMEMBER

23:26.600 --> 23:31.067
A SINGLE WORD OF THIS
ONCE THE DRUGS WEAR OFF.

23:34.233 --> 23:36.133
DR. KAREV,
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

23:36.167 --> 23:38.067
I'M OFF THE CASE.
PAGE DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.400
WE DID, BUT...

23:39.433 --> 23:40.833
OH, MAN.

23:40.867 --> 23:43.433
WERE YOU JUST TALKING
TO MEREDITH?

23:43.467 --> 23:45.467
YEAH.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.267
WHAT?

23:51.833 --> 23:55.067
DON'T, UM...

23:55.067 --> 23:58.167
DON'T HURT HER AGAIN.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.500
***

24:00.533 --> 24:02.533
YOU PLANNING ON KILLING
A WOMAN TODAY?

24:02.567 --> 24:04.433
WHAT?
THE C-SECTION

24:04.467 --> 24:06.467
YOU SHOULD'VE PERFORMED ON
REBECCA BLOOM THIS MORNING?

24:06.500 --> 24:08.400
AT THIS POINT, IT MAY BE
TOO LATE FOR HER AND THE BABY.

24:08.433 --> 24:11.333
NICE WORK, DOC.
GET AN O.R.
AND AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.700
WE'RE DOING
A CRASH C-SECTION.

24:13.733 --> 24:16.533
***

24:24.333 --> 24:25.500
OH! WHAT IS HAPPENING?

24:25.533 --> 24:28.800
REBECCA, YOUR BABY
IS HAVING LATE DECELS.

24:28.833 --> 24:31.367
HE'S IN DISTRESS. WE HAVE TO
GET YOU INTO THE DELIVERY ROOM

24:31.400 --> 24:32.467
AND GET HIM OUT RIGHT NOW.

24:32.500 --> 24:34.400
OH, NO, PLEASE.
THIS IS NO LONGER
A CONVERSATION.

24:34.433 --> 24:36.467
I AM YOUR DOCTOR, AND I AM
RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LIFE

24:36.500 --> 24:38.133
AND YOUR BABY'S LIFE,

24:38.167 --> 24:41.833
AND I'M NOT ABOUT TO LOSE
EITHER ONE OF YOU. ARE WE CLEAR?

24:41.867 --> 24:44.833
YOU JUST GONNA STAND THERE,
KAREV, OR ARE WE DOING THIS?

24:44.867 --> 24:46.200
(Rebecca groans)

24:46.233 --> 24:47.733
MR. DUQUETTE, DENNY AND I--

24:47.767 --> 24:49.600
HE--HE WAS MY PATIENT
FOR MONTHS.

24:49.633 --> 24:52.467
AND THE MINUTE HE DIED,
YOU QUIT YOUR JOB.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.700
BECAUSE I COULDN'T--
FOUR YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL,

24:53.733 --> 24:55.433
NOW THAT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF DEBT.

24:55.467 --> 24:57.833
HOW WERE YOU PLANNING
ON PAYING THAT BACK, HUH?

24:57.867 --> 25:00.300
DID YOU THINK THAT DENNY
WOULD PAY FOR EVERYTHING?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.500
WHY ARE YOU... WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:02.533 --> 25:05.233
I'M TALKING ABOUT
PROTECTING MY SON.

25:05.267 --> 25:07.167
OH, WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN YOU NEEDED YOU?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.100
BECAUSE I WAS THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.667
I WAS THERE.

25:10.700 --> 25:14.533
I WAS WORKING 80-HOUR WEEKS,
AND I WAS STILL ALWAYS THERE.

25:14.567 --> 25:17.433
HE HAD SO MANY SURGERIES,
SO MANY PROCEDURES.

25:17.467 --> 25:20.067
HE WAS SO SCARED.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.600
WHERE WERE YOU THEN?
WHERE WERE YOU?

25:22.633 --> 25:25.233
YOU MAY NOT GET ME,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

25:25.267 --> 25:27.167
BECAUSE I DON'T
GET YOU EITHER.

25:27.200 --> 25:30.200
I DON'T GET HOW A FATHER
ABANDONS HIS DYING SON.
WAIT.

25:30.233 --> 25:32.067
WAIT.

25:32.100 --> 25:33.833
IS THAT WHAT HE TOLD YOU,

25:33.867 --> 25:36.133
THAT I--THAT HIS MOTHER
AND I ABANDONED HIM?

25:36.167 --> 25:38.633
WELL...

25:38.667 --> 25:41.700
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

25:53.167 --> 25:55.233
WHAT?

25:56.133 --> 25:58.067
WHAT?

25:58.067 --> 26:00.633
OH, BURKE. I THOUGHT YOU--
YOU TOLD ME--

26:00.667 --> 26:03.167
I CAN'T HOLD IT STILL
LONG ENOUGH TO ATTACH THE GRAFT.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.600
YOU TOLD ME YOUR HAND
WAS FINE.
I CAN'T--

26:05.633 --> 26:08.067
YOU TOLD ME YOU
YOUR HAND WAS FINE.
IT'S NOT FINE!

26:08.100 --> 26:10.300
YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE
I WAS FINE.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.200
YOU WANTED ME TO BE FINE.
YOU WANTED--

26:13.233 --> 26:14.667
I WANTED--DAMN IT.

26:16.367 --> 26:20.100
MY HANDS... ARE
THE ONLY THINGS THAT I HAVE

26:20.133 --> 26:22.600
THAT ARE OF ANY VALUE
TO ME, TO YOU.

26:22.633 --> 26:24.533
NOT TO ME--
OH, YES, TO YOU.

26:24.567 --> 26:27.067
YOU WANT PRESTON BURKE.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.267
MY HANDS...

26:34.300 --> 26:37.333
THESE ARE WHO I AM.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.233
IF I CAN'T DO THIS,

26:39.267 --> 26:43.233
IF I CAN'T FINISH
THIS SURGERY, THEN...

26:59.233 --> 27:01.133
WHAT IF I HOLD THE VESSEL?

27:01.167 --> 27:04.200
COME ON, CRISTINA...

27:04.233 --> 27:06.133
WHAT IF I HOLD THE VESSEL?

27:06.167 --> 27:08.067
COME ON.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.067
BURKE...

27:11.100 --> 27:13.533
IF I HOLD THE VESSEL...

27:13.567 --> 27:15.667
I CAN ATTACH THE GRAFT.

27:15.700 --> 27:17.367
OKAY, SO...

27:17.400 --> 27:19.667
I--OKAY, I PUT MY HAND...

27:19.700 --> 27:22.567
(rubber glove snaps)

27:29.367 --> 27:32.233
NOBODY HAS TO KNOW.

27:39.167 --> 27:41.633
DEREK. EXCUSE ME. LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

27:41.667 --> 27:43.533
BUT MARK SLOAN
IS THE BEST IN HIS FIELD.

27:43.567 --> 27:45.167
ANY SURGICAL UNIT
IN THIS COUNTRY

27:45.200 --> 27:48.467
WOULD BE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT
WAS BEST FOR THIS HOSPITAL.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.167
I DID.

27:52.167 --> 27:54.200
UH... ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:54.233 --> 27:56.733
(sighs) CAN I ASK YOU A...

27:56.767 --> 27:58.733
PERSONAL QUESTION?

28:00.800 --> 28:02.700
WHY DID YOU LEAVE
MEREDITH'S MOTHER?

28:06.733 --> 28:09.300
I COULD'VE LEFT ADELE.

28:09.333 --> 28:12.300
I COULD'VE GONE AWAY
WITH ELLIS.

28:13.500 --> 28:16.167
BUT I WOULD'VE HAD
SO MUCH BAGGAGE,

28:16.200 --> 28:18.167
SO MUCH GUILT.

28:18.200 --> 28:21.200
ELLIS COULDN'T SEE IT,
BUT I WASN'T...

28:22.733 --> 28:24.633
I NEVER
WOULD'VE MADE HER HAPPY,

28:24.667 --> 28:28.467
NOT LIKE SHE DESERVED
TO BE HAPPY.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.367
I WAS A BETTER MAN
FOR WALKING AWAY.

28:31.400 --> 28:36.200
I LOVED HER ENOUGH
TO WALK AWAY.

28:36.233 --> 28:38.533
OH, OH, ON THE TABLE,
KEEP ME DRAPED.

28:38.567 --> 28:41.267
TOO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE SEEN ME NAKED ALREADY.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.233
I'D LIKE TO KEEP
WHATEVER DIGNITY I HAVE LEFT.

28:44.267 --> 28:46.100
McSTEAMY.
(whispers) MEREDITH--

28:46.133 --> 28:48.300
McSTEAMY! WHOO-HOO!

28:48.333 --> 28:50.533
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
CALLING ME NOW--McSTEAMY?

28:50.567 --> 28:52.800
YEAH, BUT I DON'T THINK
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.533
HOW'S MY FAVORITE
DIRTY MISTRESS?

28:54.567 --> 28:57.733
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD?
NOW I'M AN ADULTEROUS WHORE.

28:57.767 --> 29:01.467
(laughs) HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.200
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

29:03.233 --> 29:04.567
THANK YOU.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.300
YOU'RE WELCOME.

29:06.333 --> 29:09.267
***

29:11.833 --> 29:15.500
THE APPENDIX IS OUT.

29:15.533 --> 29:17.600
NOW WHAT DO I DO,
O'MALLEY?

29:17.633 --> 29:19.533
YOU INVERT THE STUMP
INTO THE CECUM

29:19.567 --> 29:21.400
AND PULL UP
ON THE PURSE STRINGS.

29:21.433 --> 29:23.333
SHOW ME.

29:23.367 --> 29:28.167
OKAY, STRAIGHT HEMOSTATS
AND ZERO CHROMIC.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.833
WHERE'S MY COFFEE,
KAREV?

29:29.867 --> 29:32.433
I GOT PULLED INTO
AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION. SORRY.

29:32.467 --> 29:33.767
THAT'S TOO BAD.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.300
I WAS GONNA LET YOU SCRUB IN
ON A REAL SURGERY.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.467
BUT, UM...
OH, WELL.
MAYBE NEXT TIME...

29:38.500 --> 29:40.400
IF O.B. CAN SPARE YOU.

29:40.433 --> 29:42.400
SEE YA.

29:42.433 --> 29:45.367
***

29:45.400 --> 29:48.133
FINN.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.400
DEREK.
SHE'S STILL IN SURGERY.

29:50.433 --> 29:52.233
YEAH. YEAH, I FIGURED
I'D WAIT FOR HER HERE.

29:52.267 --> 29:55.067
MEREDITH, UH, TELLS ME
THAT YOU FISH.

29:55.067 --> 29:56.700
SHE DOES?

29:56.733 --> 29:59.800
SHE TELLS ME A LOT OF THINGS.

29:59.833 --> 30:01.733
HAVE YOU BEEN
UP TO CORNET BAY?

30:01.767 --> 30:04.467
IT'S MOSTLY CHINOOK,
SOME ROCKFISH.
YOU FISH?

30:04.500 --> 30:06.467
YEAH, AS MUCH AS I CAN.
UH-HUH.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.333
MY WIFE HATED IT.
(chuckles)
YOU HAD A WIFE?

30:09.367 --> 30:11.567
YEAH. SHE DIED.

30:11.600 --> 30:15.300
I'M SORRY. I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

30:15.333 --> 30:17.833
MEREDITH DOESN'T TELL YOU
A LOT OF THINGS. ONLY ME.

30:17.867 --> 30:20.267
YEAH. FUNNY. VERY FUNNY.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.167
YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEARD
THAT SHE WAS SICK, I...

30:23.200 --> 30:25.100
PEOPLE COME THROUGH
APPENDECTOMIES ALL THE TIME.

30:25.133 --> 30:27.500
I MEAN, SHE'LL BE FINE,
RIGHT?

30:27.533 --> 30:28.533
MM-HMM.

30:28.567 --> 30:30.467
YOU REALLY LIKE HER,
DON'T YOU?

30:30.500 --> 30:32.667
YEAH.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.400
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

30:35.433 --> 30:37.133
UH, YEAH, I THINK SO.

30:37.167 --> 30:39.067
(laughs) I-I HOPE SO.

30:39.100 --> 30:42.100
***

30:43.833 --> 30:46.200
OKAY.

30:46.233 --> 30:47.733
SEE YOU LATER.

30:47.767 --> 30:49.567
I'LL SEE YOU.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.033
IT WAS DOCTOR AFTER DOCTOR.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.733
EVERYBODY HAD A--
HAD A DIFFERENT OPINION.

30:54.767 --> 30:57.567
EVERYBODY HAD
A WORSE OPINION.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.700
BEFORE THAT, DENNY HAD NEVER
BEEN SICK A DAY IN HIS LIFE.

31:00.733 --> 31:02.633
BEFORE THAT, HE HAD BEEN...

31:02.667 --> 31:05.333
(sighs)

31:05.367 --> 31:07.400
YOU KNOW, THE...

31:07.433 --> 31:11.067
THE THOUGHT OF HAVING
TO BURY YOUR OWN SON...

31:11.067 --> 31:12.800
HIS MOTHER AND I,
WE DIDN'T--

31:12.833 --> 31:15.700
WE DIDN'T
HANDLE IT VERY WELL.

31:15.733 --> 31:19.333
ONE DAY, WE CAME HOME
AND FOUND A NOTE

31:19.367 --> 31:22.433
SAYING, UH, HE DIDN'T WANT US
TO HAVE TO WATCH HIM DIE,

31:22.467 --> 31:24.233
THAT HE LEFT.

31:24.267 --> 31:27.267
WE THOUGHT...

31:27.300 --> 31:30.200
WE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD
ALL THIS TIME.

31:33.233 --> 31:36.233
I HAD NO IDEA.

31:36.267 --> 31:39.133
BELIEVE ME, IF I HAD KNOWN,
I WOULD...

31:39.167 --> 31:41.700
NEVER HAVE LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH THAT.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.667
(sighs)

31:42.700 --> 31:45.600
I BELIEVE IT.

31:48.267 --> 31:50.400
I WORKED MY WAY THROUGH
MED SCHOOL.
YOU--

31:50.433 --> 31:52.067
I PAID OFF MY DEBT.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.833
LOOK, I'M, UH, SORRY
ABOUT BEFORE.

31:53.867 --> 31:55.767
YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN--

31:55.800 --> 31:57.800
I DO. I DO.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.700
YOU'RE HIS DAD AND YOU'RE
TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

32:00.733 --> 32:03.667
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I'VE PAID OFF ALL MY DEBT.

32:03.700 --> 32:07.400
AND WHEN I MET DENNY,
I WAS GONNA BE A SURGEON,

32:07.433 --> 32:09.600
SO I DIDN'T NEED HIS MONEY.

32:09.633 --> 32:13.100
I HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED.

32:13.133 --> 32:16.367
I HAD EVERYTHING I NEEDED
UN-UNTIL, UM...

32:18.333 --> 32:21.067
(sighs) WE MISS HIM.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.233
MY GOD, WE MISS HIM.

32:24.267 --> 32:26.167
YEAH.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.200
I, UM...

32:29.467 --> 32:32.400
YEAH.

32:39.567 --> 32:41.067
WHAT IS THIS?

32:41.067 --> 32:42.833
IT'S FOR YOU.

32:42.867 --> 32:45.267
IT'S FROM DENNY.

32:55.633 --> 32:57.700
HEY. YOU READY TO GO?

32:59.600 --> 33:01.500
I'M SORRY
I HAVE TO DO THIS,

33:01.533 --> 33:03.333
BUT I HAVE TO GO HOME.

33:03.367 --> 33:04.667
IT'S IZZIE.

33:08.367 --> 33:10.067
IT'S ALWAYS IZZIE
OR MEREDITH.

33:10.067 --> 33:12.267
IT'S... IT'S NEVER ME.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.467
OH, COME ON.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

33:16.767 --> 33:19.067
WHO AM I TO YOU, GEORGE?

33:19.067 --> 33:20.567
AM I YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

33:20.600 --> 33:23.100
AM I SOMEBODY
YOU MESS AROUND WITH?

33:23.133 --> 33:25.100
DO YOU EVEN KNOW?

33:25.133 --> 33:26.800
(sighs)

33:26.833 --> 33:29.467
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.500
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER
FIGURING IT OUT.

33:35.267 --> 33:37.167
HOW'S HE DOING,
MRS. SULLIVAN?

33:37.200 --> 33:40.133
WE'RE JUST GETTING
AN UPDATE NOW, DR. BAILEY.

33:40.167 --> 33:42.567
THE SURGERY WENT WELL.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.133
WE REMOVED
THE NECROTIC TISSUE,

33:44.167 --> 33:45.533
APPLIED THE LIVE CELLS,

33:45.567 --> 33:48.533
AND IF HIS BODY RESPONDS,
IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS--

33:48.567 --> 33:50.367
HE'LL HAVE HIS FACE BACK?

33:50.400 --> 33:52.300
MR. AND MRS. SULLIVAN,

33:52.333 --> 33:55.667
YOUR FACE MAY NEVER BE
EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.600
EVEN IF EVERYTHING GOES
PERFECTLY WELL,

33:57.633 --> 33:59.133
THERE WILL BE SCARRING.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.067
BUT HE'S A SALESMAN.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.467
HE HAS SUCH A NICE FACE.

34:10.533 --> 34:14.533
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE WIFE,
MR. SULLIVAN,

34:14.567 --> 34:17.467
AND HALF A DOZEN
CAR SALESMEN IN THE LOBBY

34:17.500 --> 34:19.300
WAITING TO VISIT YOU.

34:19.333 --> 34:22.267
YOUR FACE MAY BE DIFFERENT,
BUT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO,

34:22.300 --> 34:24.200
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE

34:24.233 --> 34:28.067
OR YOUR JOB
OR HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU ARE.

34:28.100 --> 34:31.600
IT'S ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE
IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU LOVE

34:31.633 --> 34:34.133
AND WHO LOVE YOU.

34:34.167 --> 34:37.700
THAT--THAT'S ALL
THAT MATTERS.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.600
(Meredith and Finn laugh)

34:45.633 --> 34:47.133
HOW YOU FEELING?

34:47.167 --> 34:49.067
OH, MORTIFIED.

34:49.067 --> 34:50.300
I WAS JUST EXPLAINING

34:50.333 --> 34:52.067
THE "MEREDITH ON MORPHINE"
EXPERIENCE.

34:52.100 --> 34:54.300
AHH. YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
WAS IT MEMORABLE?

34:54.333 --> 34:56.600
I'LL LET FINN TELL YOU.
I'LL COME BACK.

34:56.633 --> 34:58.533
NO, A-ACTUALLY, I'VE--
I'VE JUST BEEN SENT

34:58.567 --> 35:01.333
ON A MISSION TO GET
THE, UH, PATIENT'S ICE CHIPS.

35:01.367 --> 35:04.267
BE RIGHT BACK.
(sighs)

35:04.300 --> 35:08.433
HOW BADLY
DID I EMBARRASS MYSELF?

35:08.467 --> 35:10.067
WHAT?

35:10.100 --> 35:11.667
MNH-MNH.

35:18.667 --> 35:20.567
YOU DESERVE TO BE
WITH SOMEBODY

35:20.600 --> 35:22.467
WHO MAKES YOU HAPPY,

35:22.500 --> 35:25.067
SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT GONNA
COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE,

35:25.100 --> 35:28.067
SOMEBODY WHO WON'T HURT YOU.

35:37.167 --> 35:40.100
HE'S A BETTER GUY,
MEREDITH.

35:40.133 --> 35:42.667
FINN'S THE BETTER GUY.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.700
DEREK...

35:47.733 --> 35:51.567
I'M WALKING AWAY.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.667
HE LEFT A MESSAGE.

36:14.700 --> 36:16.600
DENNY LEFT A MESSAGE
FOR HIS PARENTS

36:16.633 --> 36:18.433
THE NIGHT...

36:20.367 --> 36:23.233
HIS FATHER GAVE ME
THE NUMBER AND THE CODE,

36:23.267 --> 36:26.400
BUT, UM...

36:26.433 --> 36:29.333
I JUST COULDN'T
DO IT ALONE.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.200
***

36:37.567 --> 36:40.467
ADDISON... CAN WE TALK?

36:40.500 --> 36:42.400
I DON'T WANT YOU HERE,
MARK.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.333
I THINK I'VE MADE THAT
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR.

36:44.367 --> 36:47.167
SO... IF YOU INSIST
ON STAYING,

36:47.200 --> 36:50.433
JUST... KNOW THAT
WE'RE COWORKERS

36:50.467 --> 36:52.733
AND NOTHING MORE.

36:52.767 --> 36:55.767
***

36:55.800 --> 36:57.567
KAREV.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.833
AS OF RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE
OFFICIALLY OFF MY SERVICE.

37:00.867 --> 37:02.667
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

37:02.700 --> 37:05.433
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
MISS ME.

37:05.467 --> 37:08.167
(telephone rings)

37:08.200 --> 37:10.833
(Denny Sr.) Hello,
you've reached the Duquettes.

37:10.867 --> 37:13.067
(beeping)

37:13.067 --> 37:16.067
(Denny) Dad, Mom, it's me.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.067
I'm calling from
Seattle Grace Hospital,

37:18.067 --> 37:20.700
where the beautiful, talented

37:20.733 --> 37:23.600
and incredibly stubborn
Dr. Isobel Stevens

37:23.633 --> 37:26.333
has just given me
a brand-new heart

37:26.367 --> 37:28.800
and promised to marry me.

37:28.833 --> 37:31.300
I know we've had
our differences,

37:31.333 --> 37:34.567
and I'm sorry
we've been out of touch.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.300
MORE CHICKEN SURGERY?

37:38.333 --> 37:40.267
I'M MAKING YOU DINNER.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.733
Believe it or not,

37:41.767 --> 37:44.733
I was trying to make
everything better.

37:44.767 --> 37:48.600
I know you're angry.
I hope you'll forgive me.

37:48.633 --> 37:53.367
Turns out, sometimes you
have to do the wrong thing...

37:53.400 --> 37:56.100
McSTEAMY, RIGHT?

37:56.133 --> 37:58.233
YOU MUST BE A FRIEND
OF MEREDITH'S.

37:58.267 --> 38:00.833
NOT REALLY. DR. TORRES.

38:00.867 --> 38:01.800
CALLIE.

38:01.833 --> 38:04.833
MARK SLOAN.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.167
BAD DAY?

38:07.200 --> 38:09.633
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.067
YOU?

38:11.067 --> 38:13.067
OH, YEAH.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.433
SO WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD
ABOUT ME, EXACTLY?

38:16.467 --> 38:18.667
MOSTLY THINGS
THAT INVOLVE THE WORDS

38:18.700 --> 38:21.167
"DIRTY" AND "BAD."

38:21.200 --> 38:23.400
RIGHT.

38:23.433 --> 38:25.333
***

38:25.367 --> 38:28.733
I GUESS THERE, UH, REALLY IS
NO STARTING OVER, IS THERE?

38:28.767 --> 38:31.400
(sighs)

38:33.100 --> 38:35.767
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK,
CALLIE?

38:35.800 --> 38:39.800
***

38:43.700 --> 38:46.567
ONLY IF YOU HAVE IT
DELIVERED TO MY HOTEL ROOM,

38:46.600 --> 38:50.067
BECAUSE I'M OFF TO BED.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.833
***

38:51.867 --> 38:54.700
sometimes you have to make
a big mistake...

38:54.733 --> 38:56.533
YOU COMIN'?

38:56.567 --> 38:59.400
***

38:59.433 --> 39:01.333
to figure out
how to make things right.

39:01.367 --> 39:03.700
SO WHAT TIME
DO THEY LET US VISITORS

39:03.733 --> 39:06.300
START VISITING
IN THE MORNING?

39:08.333 --> 39:10.600
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

39:10.633 --> 39:12.133
I DON'T MIND.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.367
NO, FINN.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.633
REALLY,
YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.

39:18.667 --> 39:21.667
***

39:26.867 --> 39:29.633
SO IT'S DEREK.

39:29.667 --> 39:31.433
I'M SORRY.

39:35.533 --> 39:36.833
(sighs)

39:36.867 --> 39:38.767
CAN I ASK WHY?

39:38.800 --> 39:41.367
YOU ARE A GREAT GUY...

39:41.400 --> 39:43.533
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL GUY,

39:43.567 --> 39:47.400
AND YOU MAY EVEN BE
THE BETTER GUY.

39:47.433 --> 39:48.700
BUT...

39:48.733 --> 39:50.500
HE'S THE ONE.

39:50.533 --> 39:53.567
AND I WISH HE WASN'T.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.567
HE'S GONNA HURT YOU AGAIN...

39:59.267 --> 40:00.833
AND WHEN HE DOES,

40:00.867 --> 40:03.300
I WON'T BE HERE.

40:03.333 --> 40:07.333
***

40:07.367 --> 40:10.667
Mistakes are painful...

40:10.700 --> 40:12.600
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
MEREDITH.

40:12.633 --> 40:16.267
but they're the only way
to find out who you really are.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.300
I know who I am now.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.133
I know what I want.

40:22.167 --> 40:24.367
I've got the love
of my life...

40:24.400 --> 40:26.433
a new heart...

40:26.467 --> 40:29.600
and I want you guys to get
on the next plane out here

40:29.633 --> 40:32.767
and meet my girl.

40:32.800 --> 40:37.467
Everything's
gonna be different now.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.400
I promise.

40:39.433 --> 40:41.333
From here on out,

40:41.367 --> 40:44.200
nothing's ever
gonna be the same.

40:44.233 --> 40:48.200
I love you. Bye.
