so I'm just gonna have to say it.

-Mm-hm. [chuckles]

-What, rimming?

No, sex.

36:48.645 --> 36:49.645
I don't know.

36:50.285 --> 36:51.405
I think it'll be nice.

36:52.485 --> 36:54.965
It feels good to wank,
so it must be like that, but better.

36:55.405 --> 36:57.725
And doing it with someone who likes you
must be awesome,

36:57.805 --> 36:59.005
because they really get you.

36:59.085 --> 37:01.445

[Sarah] I remember you from last time.

39:25.725 --> 39:27.645
[nurse] Only vanilla left, I'm afraid.

39:27.925 --> 39:30.845
-[Sarah] I don't like vanilla.
-[nurse] Sorry, it's all we've got.

39:31.445 --> 39:34.285
[Sarah] Can you see if... if there are
any chocolate ones left?

39:34.845 --> 39:35.925
[nurse] We're all out.

39:36.405 --> 39:39.245
[Sarah] Ju-- Yeah, but I know
that you've got them. So, can...

39:39.765 --> 39:40.965
Can you just go and ask?

39:41.045 --> 39:43.925
'Cause I-- I really don't like vanilla,
it's not even a flavor.

39:44.245 --> 39:46.525
[nurse] Like I said, we haven't got any.

39:46.605 --> 39:49.645
[Sarah] Yeah, and like I said,
I don't fucking like vanilla.

39:49.725 --> 39:51.885
So I just want a chocolate one.

39:52.965 --> 39:54.485
We're not a restaurant, Sarah.

Look, don't... don't worry, love.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.245

40:48.325 --> 40:52.845

about the ones that I had

40:52.925 --> 40:54.125
than the ones I chose not to.

40:57.365 --> 41:01.685
It's better not being a mum at all
than being a bad one.

Let's get you home.

41:48.165 --> 41:49.045
Hi.

41:51.565 --> 41:52.605
You waited.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.205
Of course.

41:58.445 --> 42:00.325
You may have some vomiting or nausea.

42:00.405 --> 42:02.605
If the vomiting continues
for more than 24 hours,

42:02.685 --> 42:04.165
then you should inform the clinic.

42:04.525 --> 42:06.485
Some bleeding is typical,

42:06.565 --> 42:09.765
but if it’s very heavy,
then you should call us straightaway.

42:09.845 --> 42:10.765
-Okay.
-Okay?

42:12.365 --> 42:13.325

Do you want a sandwich?

42:30.885 --> 42:32.205
You're so weird, Otis.

42:33.765 --> 42:36.085
You should meet my mum
if you think I'm weird.

42:36.165 --> 42:38.965
All she does is talk about sex.
She has zero boundaries.

42:39.725 --> 42:42.245
She teaches this workshop called
"My Yoni, Myself."

42:43.365 --> 42:44.645
"Yoni" means vagina.

42:45.765 --> 42:48.045
She hates my dad, too.
He lives in America.

42:48.605 --> 42:51.925
But yeah, she's constantly asking me
inappropriate things,

42:52.005 --> 42:54.165
and she thinks it's totally acceptable.

42:54.685 --> 42:55.885
She’s basically mental.
