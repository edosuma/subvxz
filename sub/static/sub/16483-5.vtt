00:01.377 --> 00:03.921
<i>Previously on</i>
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D....

00:04.005 --> 00:05.965
Lucy, look at you.
What happened?

00:06.048 --> 00:07.591
We shouldn't have used
the Darkhold.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.093
That book can fix us.

00:10.553 --> 00:12.346
You can't let him touch you.
You'll go crazy.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.434
You saved a friend of mine from a guy
my bullets went straight through.

00:18.144 --> 00:20.104
You're the only one we know
that can hurt those things.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.648
You know someone that worked
at that Momentum facility?

00:22.732 --> 00:23.816
My uncle.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.401
<i>Doing time at South Ridge Penitentiary?</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:27.653
<i>He always said the guy
he beat up was the real criminal.</i>

00:27.737 --> 00:31.157
- Who is she?
- Dr Lucy Bauer. Joseph's wife.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.951
They were the project leaders
at this privately funded think tank.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.203
- What is she after?
- She's gonna go after the book.

00:36.287 --> 00:37.371
It's called the Darkhold.

00:37.455 --> 00:38.914
Look, I know
you two like to work alone.

00:38.998 --> 00:41.250
You don't need us? Fine.
Right now, we need you.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.585
Do you have any idea
where to start?

00:42.668 --> 00:45.379
Joseph Bauer.
He's been in a coma all these years.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.547
<i>Well, he just woke up.</i>

00:46.630 --> 00:48.007
Where's the book?

01:03.022 --> 01:06.067
- Oh, Lucy, this has to be it.
- Mildew and cobwebs.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.359
You know, this reminds me

01:07.443 --> 01:08.694
of Outer Mongolia.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.905
You got to admit,
the yurt was kind of romantic.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.282
And we were so sure it was there.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.284
So...

01:16.202 --> 01:17.745
what are the odds that it's here?

01:17.828 --> 01:21.165
In the family home of the guy
who killed the last person who had it?

01:21.248 --> 01:23.125
We've never been this close.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.794
Well, we've said that before.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.005
What if we spent all these years
doing the science

01:28.089 --> 01:29.673
instead of looking for shortcuts?

01:29.757 --> 01:32.093
If we did the actual work...

01:33.135 --> 01:36.138
Whoa. This is weird.

01:43.479 --> 01:44.480
Okay.

01:45.981 --> 01:46.899
Here.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.501
Is it...

02:13.759 --> 02:14.844
- Okay.
- Here.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.220
Okay.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.111
Wait. What the...?

02:39.994 --> 02:41.704
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

02:42.329 --> 02:45.207
I didn't think it would be in German.

02:47.877 --> 02:49.295
No, I'm reading English.

02:50.004 --> 02:52.298
Wait.
Are you not seeing what I'm seeing?

02:55.551 --> 02:58.721
Joe, German is your first language.

02:59.096 --> 03:01.891
Y... Yes, but this is not possible.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.310
Unless...

03:05.102 --> 03:08.355
What if, in some way,
it is reading us?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.876
<i>- Dr Bauer, stay with us!
- Get away! Get away from me!</i>

03:28.959 --> 03:30.336
Get away! I see what you are.

03:30.419 --> 03:32.046
Focus, Dr Bauer.
We need your help.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.339
You... You're demons.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.174
You're demons.
You've come to take me away.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.592
You've come to take me away.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.260
She was here, your wife, Lucy.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.763
Dr Bauer, please. We don't want
anyone else getting hurt.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.057
It was a mistake.
We never should have taken it.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.142
- We should've left it buried.
- The book?

03:45.226 --> 03:46.602
We need to know where it is.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.812
You can't have it. Get away from me.
Get away!

03:48.896 --> 03:50.356
Patient is coding.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.523
- Stand back please!
- Get away!

03:51.607 --> 03:54.109
- Dr Bauer, please, where is the book?
- Sir, I need you to stand back.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.445
I buried it back where I found it!

04:08.332 --> 04:10.876
Too late. She knows.

04:38.529 --> 04:39.446
No.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.490
No.

04:42.074 --> 04:46.412
No, no, no, no, no...

04:46.495 --> 04:48.789
No!

04:58.966 --> 05:01.135
If this thing is that dangerous,
then why not tell him?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.429
- He's the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
- We don't know if we can trust him.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.014
So why the hell is he here?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.641
Without him, we wouldn't know
the Darkhold had resurfaced.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.977
But fewer people
who know about it, the better.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.896
Fury had no problem opening up
Pandora's Box from time to time,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.231
but even he was afraid
of this thing.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.233
It's powerful, it's deadly,

05:16.317 --> 05:19.778
and now probably in the hands
of a pissed-off mad-scientist ghost.

05:19.862 --> 05:23.657
So, thoughts, feelings?
This is a safe space.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.034
We need another crack at Eli Morrow.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.162
He's the one that knows this book.
He'll know what Lucy Bauer wants with it

05:28.537 --> 05:31.206
- and where she's going next.
- My uncle is not gonna talk to you.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.083
Well, then this time,
we won't give him a choice.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.670
Let's inform S.H.I.E.L.D.
we're taking an asset

05:36.754 --> 05:39.423
into protective custody
as part of a routine investigation.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.676
May, want to go to prison?
Could be Taco Tuesday.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.470
I'll call the warden and find out.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.681
Lucy leaves a lot of crazy
in her wake.

05:47.765 --> 05:49.850
If we're gonna track her down,
we're gonna need that antidote.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.894
- Fitz said that they were close.
- I don't want it close.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.062
I want it here.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.856
Wait. If we're going
to get my uncle, I'm going with you.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.650
- No, you're not.
- If your uncle can lead us to Lucy,

05:58.734 --> 06:01.612
then maybe we'll let you out
to bust some ghosts,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.489
but until then,
your ass stays on the plane.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.407
- I don't take orders.
- Then this will be a new experience.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.618
- You can't keep me here.
- Maybe not.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.453
But you take this plane down,
you'll be burning up

06:09.536 --> 06:11.246
the only people in the world
trying to help you.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.672
He's growing on me. You?

06:25.177 --> 06:27.137
I need to get off this plane now.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.517
That should put you in...
rural Utah.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.521
- And you think you're pissed off now...
- This is no joke. All right?

06:35.604 --> 06:37.189
I should be down there,
getting answers, my way.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.774
Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.860
- Cracking skulls?
- It's worked so far.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.113
- Really?
- I've been careful.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.573
I've never been caught,
not even a parking ticket.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.867
Then you show up,
and you bring S.H.I.E.L.D. with you.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.619
Careful? Really?

06:51.286 --> 06:54.456
You've been murdering people
while possessed and on fire.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.874
You don't know
what you're talking about.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.419
I know you're settling scores,
hoping that thing will go away.

06:59.128 --> 07:00.337
How's that going for you?

07:03.132 --> 07:06.593
Look, Robbie,
I get that this is personal for you.

07:07.219 --> 07:10.013
But if you want answers,
you need to trust S.H.I.E.L.D.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.348
You don't even trust them.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.601
Why else are you up here hiding from them?

07:15.394 --> 07:17.688
I keep my distance
because it's what's best...

07:19.690 --> 07:20.816
for everyone.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.445
I'm starting to see why.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.998
<i>We can learn a lot
when someone dies,</i>

07:36.415 --> 07:39.001
as was the case when you
and Radcliffe killed Agent May.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.335
Actually, that was less of a killing

07:40.419 --> 07:44.047
and more of a... a full system reboot,
which is brilliant.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.551
And her brain scan allowed us
to create an antidote.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.511
Bold strokes. Well-played.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.514
Excuse me?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.059
Thank you.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.103
I think we're gonna need
bold strokes,

07:58.187 --> 08:01.106
because, apparently, that thing
that Lucy Bauer's after,

08:01.899 --> 08:03.859
Coulson is saying it's pretty serious.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.906
- Something called the Darkh...
- All right, stop. Not another word.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.574
At least you finally said one to me.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.119
I have my lie-detection today,
and I do not want another secret.

08:14.745 --> 08:19.875
Along with Daisy, Robbie Reyes,
and your pet project Aida...

08:19.958 --> 08:22.503
Oh, come on.
How many times have I got to say it?

08:22.586 --> 08:23.712
The polygraph is the reason

08:23.795 --> 08:24.963
- I didn't say anything.
- Forget the polygraph.

08:25.047 --> 08:26.048
- This isn't about the polygraph!
- What was I supposed to do?

08:26.131 --> 08:27.841
We're supposed to share everything!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.011
We share a bed,

08:31.845 --> 08:34.097
but this whole time, you were
lying there, keeping things from me.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.558
Oh, come on.
I wanted to tell you, of course.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.061
I... And I knew
that you'd think she was fascinating...

08:39.144 --> 08:40.229
It.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.232
It's fascinating.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.817
And now it is going
to get me sacked.

08:47.653 --> 08:51.365
Did you know
there are over 212 micro-expressions

08:51.448 --> 08:52.616
that can betray a lie?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.869
One eye dart to the left,
and I'm finished.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.122
Unlike some people,
I'm terrible at keeping secrets.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.959
So... it is about the polygraph.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.129
All right, well, okay.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.006
Well, look, I'll just stay here,
and I'll help you practice.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.717
We could do the penny in the shoe thing
and the thumbtack under the tongue.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.052
It's the other way around.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.304
And no, just go.
Coulson needs you.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.223
I'll work it out.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.433
I am not getting fired today.

09:19.726 --> 09:24.147
Hey, no eye dart to the left.
I 100 percent bought that.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.069
All right, see you later, then.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.199
Who am I kidding?

09:34.950 --> 09:40.038
They'll skip right over the firing part
and throw me behind bloody bars.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.800
You know, I ask for field work,
you give me paperwork.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.886
What's wrong with taking it easy?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.015
Come on.
You had a near-death experience.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.267
It was a death experience.
I'm over it.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.102
Well, I'm really not over mine.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.729
I thought
you'd want to talk about it.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.815
- You know, what it felt like.
- Didn't feel like a trip to Tahiti.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.359
Which means it was something else.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.113
See, I died,

10:13.196 --> 10:15.240
but anything I would've seen or felt
was wiped away.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.700
I don't remember anything,
but you do.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.452
- What do you want to know, Phil?
- What did you see?

10:18.535 --> 10:19.494
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.246
- No. W...
- Agents, follow me.

10:22.789 --> 10:27.210
So, we're transferring into
S.H.I.E.L.D. custody one Elias Morrow.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.962
Everything should be in order.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.300
Agent May called ahead
just to cut down on paperwork.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.012
She really hates paperwork.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.223
Don't you?

10:43.101 --> 10:44.227
Yeah.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.272
We'll get this taken care of.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.860
- One last thing.
- Coulson!

10:56.406 --> 10:58.617
You can't fool me, you demons!

11:22.349 --> 11:23.809
- Demons everywhere!
- Incoming!

11:24.810 --> 11:25.686
Demons!

11:28.980 --> 11:31.483
I'm gonna state the obvious.
Dr Bauer's here,

11:31.566 --> 11:33.819
and we need to get to Eli Morrow
before she does.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.739
- Our ICERs are in lockup.
- Mack, do you read me?

11:38.115 --> 11:40.742
- The prison's compromised.
<i>- Let me guess, Lucy Bauer?</i>

11:41.451 --> 11:43.412
Lucy and the whole <i>Peanuts</i> gang.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.957
So... she has friends.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.668
We'll have to assume
they're targeting Eli Morrow.

11:49.751 --> 11:50.836
Targeting?

11:50.919 --> 11:52.963
Well, he put her husband
in a coma, right?

11:53.046 --> 11:56.007
Coulson and May are barricaded
in the Warden's office.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.009
Here, on the west side.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.930
And Eli Morrow is located
in the east wing,

12:02.013 --> 12:03.557
here, in Cellblock E.

12:04.141 --> 12:05.767
We'll split into two teams.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.186
Daisy, you lead a team
to extract Coulson and May.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.313
- I'll lead a team to grab Eli.
- I'm going.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.734
This is my family. You have no reason
to keep me out of this.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.485
Because you only kill people
that deserve it.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.070
- Exactly.
- Well, down there,

12:17.154 --> 12:19.364
everyone deserves it,
so you stay put.

12:19.448 --> 12:21.575
No, we need an advantage down there.
It's him.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.994
We can't even touch these things.
He can kill them.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.329
You said if you needed
some ghosts busted...

12:28.582 --> 12:29.791
Okay...

12:30.417 --> 12:31.877
But you don't leave my side.

12:33.462 --> 12:36.339
And just so we're clear,
this is an ICERs-only op.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.175
Anyone could have the psychosis,

12:38.258 --> 12:40.385
so they can't be held
responsible for their actions.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.054
Now, S.H.I.E.L.D. is marshalling forces
to control the perimeter,

12:43.138 --> 12:46.099
but that's hours away. Right now,
we're the only ones going in,

12:46.183 --> 12:48.685
- and we'll be outnumbered.
- Works for me.

12:51.646 --> 12:52.981
Fitz's Quinjet is five minutes out.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.233
That means we leave in six.
Gear up.

13:08.371 --> 13:11.082
- You sure you're up for this?
- Let's find out.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.711
Yeah, new and improved gauntlets,
but Simmons said if you quake...

13:14.795 --> 13:17.631
I could shatter every bone
in my body and be crippled for life?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.257
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Daisy...

13:19.341 --> 13:20.425
I'm not gonna risk it.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.427
Besides,
I didn't always have powers, and...

13:23.720 --> 13:27.724
- I did all right.
- Cases of Sanity, as ordered.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.478
I'm gonna need you up here
quarterbacking us on comms.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.146
"Quarterbacking"?

13:33.230 --> 13:35.398
Yeah, it means
that you call the plays.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.276
Well, see, I was under the impression
it was the coaches who called the plays.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.612
And that's why American footballers need
those little radio things in their ears

13:40.695 --> 13:42.781
to tell them what to do for
the few minutes that they're on the field.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.324
Yeah. Got it, Coach.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.078
- So, these work like EpiPens?
- Almost, but more efficient.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.246
To counteract the psychosis,

13:49.329 --> 13:51.331
the serum needs to be delivered
directly into the brain stem,

13:51.414 --> 13:56.461
so the injector needs to be placed
at the base of the skull.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.172
Wait, wait... Hold on now.
You know I don't like needles.

13:59.256 --> 14:00.757
Well, I mean,
it's a bee sting, really.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.260
Oh, hell...

14:20.944 --> 14:23.697
- Where're the guards?
- That's a good question.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.950
Keep your heads down.
Not all of them will be friendly.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.577
Yes, sir.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.086
A few more questions.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.886
Agent Simmons, are you now,
or have you ever been,

14:45.969 --> 14:48.305
- a member of Hydra?
- Absolutely.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.725
- What?
- On assignment, undercover.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.977
My allegiance has always
been to S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.479
Almost done.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.359
Have you ever obtained
sensitive information

15:01.443 --> 15:03.361
that you are obligated to report

15:03.445 --> 15:06.489
up the Security Spectrum
or to the Director?

15:15.040 --> 15:18.084
Agent Simmons, would you like me
to repeat the question?

15:18.501 --> 15:22.422
No, it's j...
It's very wide-ranging.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.049
Agent Simmons.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.679
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.057
Now.

15:35.352 --> 15:38.146
- Hey, who are you guys?
- How's it looking, Coach?

15:38.229 --> 15:39.356
Where the CO at?

15:41.316 --> 15:43.193
<i>Well, from what I can tell,
Lucy and her cohorts</i>

15:43.276 --> 15:46.446
are searching cell by cell for Eli Morrow,
which means they don't know where he is.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.951
- Oh, that's good.
<i>- Yeah, except I have now lost them.</i>

15:51.660 --> 15:54.913
So they're either avoiding the cameras
or they've reverted to a halituous state.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.375
- Say what?
- A hali... They've gone all ghostly.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.794
- Smart.
- Yeah. Well, they are scientists.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.837
They tend to think strategically
in these situations.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.048
That's what makes us
such formidable adversaries.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.050
<i>At least they haven't infected
the prisoners.</i>

16:36.204 --> 16:37.706
This is not the objective.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.592
Come back any time, G.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.595
I didn't bring you down here
to settle scores.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.431
- I'm good.
- Really?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.808
Because I don't think you can control
that thing inside of you.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.103
And if I have to shoot you
to keep him from coming out,

17:00.645 --> 17:01.646
I will.

17:13.116 --> 17:16.828
We're here to, uh... rescue you?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.038
Thought we'd meet you halfway.

17:18.121 --> 17:19.664
- Do we have Eli Morrow?
- Not yet.

17:19.748 --> 17:20.957
Then we back up Mack and Robbie.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.667
Agents, we need Warden Green
and his COs lucid

17:23.752 --> 17:25.045
if we're gonna retake this place.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.005
Plus, the demon conversation
gets stale.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.339
Copy that.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.637
Stop whining.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.481
I know it's a little public,

17:44.564 --> 17:47.734
but it's the fastest route
to Eli's cell. Believe me.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.076
- Coulson.
- I see it, too.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.786
It's how they're organising.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.289
All the new Watchdogs,
they're recruiting in prison,

18:02.082 --> 18:03.666
uniting against us.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.754
Hey, you seeing this?
It's S.H.I.E.L.D.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.506
They protect those freaks.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.219
- Which one of you's the freak?
- Come on, let's go.

18:15.845 --> 18:16.888
Hey, stop.

18:39.702 --> 18:40.870
Show me what you got.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.623
Fitz, we could really use that exit.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.335
If I release the door,
all the doors in cellblock A open.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.087
The security wings,

18:49.170 --> 18:50.505
- the exterior exits...
- Just do it!

18:58.972 --> 19:00.014
Go, go!

19:01.724 --> 19:02.809
Kill the freak!

19:08.398 --> 19:10.733
I get it.
You and Phil Coulson are close.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.111
I'm the new Director, your boss,

19:13.194 --> 19:15.822
so you think there are things
that I don't need to know. But I do.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.450
Agent Simmons, can I trust you?

19:20.243 --> 19:21.452
Definitely.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.831
Great, because, boy,
do I need your help.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.668
I'm debating Senator Nadeer
on television

19:28.751 --> 19:31.045
about the "Inhuman War on Humans."

19:31.129 --> 19:33.965
I hate that the media's calling it that,
Burrows says it's terrible branding,

19:34.048 --> 19:37.010
but either way, this is a battle
for hearts and minds.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.346
- What can I do?
- Facts, Simmons.

19:40.430 --> 19:44.559
I need cold, hard, scientific facts
to back up our case during this debate.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.227
I can put together a PowerPoint

19:46.311 --> 19:49.856
on Inhuman genetics,
biology, sociological impacts...

19:49.939 --> 19:52.317
Yeah, here's the thing.
I think it might be better

19:52.400 --> 19:57.030
if I literally had
what's in your head... in my head.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.367
Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have
that kind of technology.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.827
Oh, sure it does.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.248
Ah...

20:08.541 --> 20:11.878
So, all you need to do is listen in,
tell me exactly what to say,

20:11.961 --> 20:14.005
and know that any error,
slip-up, or mishap

20:14.088 --> 20:16.591
could endanger the lives
of humans and Inhumans alike.

20:16.674 --> 20:17.592
Ah.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.136
Also, we're live in 15 minutes.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.182
- About back there...
- Forget it.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.642
Uh, I can't do that.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.435
That thing inside you
is my responsibility.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.853
No, it's mine.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.105
And if you can't control it?

20:32.941 --> 20:35.109
Look.
My uncle can't know what I am.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.948
So I'll keep it down.
Not for you, for him.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.950
I need you
to do something for me.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.368
Duck!

21:20.196 --> 21:21.739
Ghost busted.

21:58.192 --> 22:01.863
Unless your face also does
a Clown Posse thing,

22:02.238 --> 22:05.408
I'm infected.
Give me some space.

22:13.249 --> 22:15.001
- Can you hear me?
- Mm.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.337
Yep. You can back off the mic.

22:19.547 --> 22:20.631
Copy that, sir.

22:20.715 --> 22:24.093
Everyone set? Quiet, please.
We're about ready to roll.

22:24.177 --> 22:28.723
Our end is live in four,
three, two...

22:30.016 --> 22:32.226
<i>Many of you
are familiar with Senator Ellen Nadeer.</i>

22:32.310 --> 22:34.854
<i>She's head of the Finance Committee
and outspoken advocate</i>

22:34.937 --> 22:37.231
<i>of the so-called
Humans First movement.</i>

22:37.315 --> 22:38.399
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

22:38.483 --> 22:40.943
<i>And of course, our next guest
needs little introduction.</i>

22:41.027 --> 22:44.614
<i>He is a patriot, a public servant
known all over the world.</i>

22:44.697 --> 22:47.950
<i>He put his life on the line to save others
during the UN bombing in Vienna.</i>

22:48.034 --> 22:51.371
<i>He's now the Director of the
newly reformed S.H.I.E.L.D., Jeffrey Mace.</i>

22:51.454 --> 22:52.830
<i>It's an honour to be here, George.</i>

22:52.914 --> 22:54.374
<i>Let's get started. Director Mace.</i>

22:54.457 --> 22:57.168
<i>After an intro like that,
I think I deserve some equal time.</i>

22:57.251 --> 22:59.003
<i>I'd like to ask the Director a question.</i>

22:59.087 --> 23:00.338
<i>Go ahead, Senator.</i>

23:00.421 --> 23:01.672
<i>Just what is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s purpose</i>

23:01.756 --> 23:03.549
<i>if it's not protecting us
from the Inhumans?</i>

23:03.633 --> 23:06.052
<i>Why are human lives
not S.H.I.E.L.D.'s priority?</i>

23:06.135 --> 23:08.471
Actually, Inhumans and humans
share 99.8 percent

23:08.554 --> 23:10.723
- of the human genome.
- Inhumans are human,

23:10.807 --> 23:12.475
and the science
is in agreement with me.

23:12.850 --> 23:16.771
In fact, we share 99.8 percent
of the human genome.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.107
<i>It really is that close.
I had no idea.</i>

23:19.190 --> 23:20.775
<i>- It really is, George.
- Genetics can't explain</i>

23:20.858 --> 23:23.111
<i>the blackouts that plunged parts
of the world into darkness.</i>

23:23.194 --> 23:25.154
<i>People were terrorised.
Lives were lost.</i>

23:25.238 --> 23:27.532
- Two people died in a helicopter crash...
- Let us never forget...

23:27.615 --> 23:28.699
...while 17 Inhumans were murdered.

23:28.783 --> 23:32.328
...that more Inhumans than humans
were lost during that crisis.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.664
<i>And yet every day,
there are reports</i>

23:34.747 --> 23:38.418
<i>of disturbances in Hong Kong
or blue-skinned killers in Wyoming.</i>

23:38.501 --> 23:41.671
<i>Well, if I was to respond
to every tabloid story</i>

23:41.754 --> 23:43.673
<i>and... and... and Sasquatch sighting,</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:47.135
I couldn't do my job,
which is to protect this great nation.

23:47.677 --> 23:50.096
<i>What about the very real situation</i>

23:50.179 --> 23:52.140
<i>happening right now,
outside of Los Angeles?</i>

23:52.223 --> 23:54.767
<i>Is it true that S.H.I.E.L.D.
has compromised a prison?</i>

23:56.352 --> 23:58.146
We have no data on that,
do we?

23:58.521 --> 24:01.274
It's our policy not to comment
on ongoing operations,

24:01.357 --> 24:04.652
but I can assure you that
S.H.I.E.L.D. has the situation

24:04.735 --> 24:06.737
completely under control.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.074
Let's go, go, go!

24:14.287 --> 24:15.538
Come on, come on, come on!

24:15.621 --> 24:17.874
<i>Coulson, the exit is on the north side.</i>

24:17.957 --> 24:19.959
I'm gonna try and get you
to a secure cellblock.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.669
There!

24:27.008 --> 24:28.426
Let's go!

24:29.343 --> 24:32.513
- We're never gonna make it!
- Come on! Come on, come on!

24:34.015 --> 24:36.142
Let's go! May!
Go through!

24:38.060 --> 24:39.604
- You're gonna make it.
- What?

24:39.687 --> 24:41.981
Daisy, no!
Open the door!

24:42.064 --> 24:44.275
This is my fight, not yours.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.319
- Don't do this!
- Damn it!

24:50.239 --> 24:52.617
Here, boy.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.209
Fitz, change of plans.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.669
Find us another way into the cafeteria.
I don't care how.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.134
Get her!

25:41.582 --> 25:43.793
Where are the guards?

25:49.507 --> 25:51.467
<i>- Tío.</i>
- Robbie, what are you doing here?

25:51.551 --> 25:53.177
- I'm getting you out of here.
- What?

25:55.012 --> 25:56.430
Step back, please.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.270
No, no. Is he S.H.I.E.L.D.?

26:02.937 --> 26:04.021
You're in danger.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.190
Lucy Bauer is here,
and she's coming for you.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.484
Robbie, I told you
to stay away from this.

26:08.568 --> 26:12.154
Mr Morrow, Dr Bauer can walk
through walls, so we got to go.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.781
Walk through walls?

26:14.448 --> 26:15.992
Yeah, S.H.I.E.L.D. said she had abilities.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.660
Yeah, now we think she has that book.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.162
So who knows
what else she's capable of.

26:20.746 --> 26:21.914
The book?

26:23.833 --> 26:25.334
Yeah. Let's go.

26:50.568 --> 26:54.447
<i>People are scared that Inhumans
don't share our core values.</i>

26:54.530 --> 26:55.615
<i>And who could blame them?</i>

26:55.698 --> 26:58.701
<i>How many of our citizens have died
under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s watch?</i>

26:58.784 --> 27:01.037
Fatalities have decreased since
the signing of...

27:01.120 --> 27:04.790
We're proud to say that fatalities
have actually decreased sharply

27:04.874 --> 27:07.001
since the signing
of the Sokovia Accords.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.669
It's a legacy I hope to build on.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.921
<i>Treaties mean nothing
to the Inhumans.</i>

27:11.005 --> 27:12.506
<i>We're dealing
with something different here.</i>

27:12.590 --> 27:13.758
<i>Senator, when you say "different,"</i>

27:13.841 --> 27:15.968
<i>that sounds like a dog whistle
aimed at hate groups.</i>

27:16.052 --> 27:17.720
<i>There's no dog whistle needed,
George.</i>

27:17.803 --> 27:20.056
<i>Just the word "Inhuman"
is frightening enough,</i>

27:20.139 --> 27:22.350
<i>and yet they choose
to define themselves that way.</i>

27:22.433 --> 27:25.645
See, that kind of comment,
illustrates the problem.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.813
If we can't talk about
Inhumans with respect...

27:27.897 --> 27:29.482
<i>You can't talk about them
with honesty.</i>

27:29.565 --> 27:30.733
<i>How can people trust you?</i>

27:32.735 --> 27:35.196
<i>Director Mace, you take
a damn good photo, I'll give you that,</i>

27:35.279 --> 27:37.281
<i>but that doesn't make you
the man for this job.</i>

27:38.908 --> 27:41.327
Stick to the facts.
Since S.H.I.E.L.D. has been re...

27:41.410 --> 27:42.662
Hmm.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.665
So, you don't think
I'm the man for the job.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.918
Well...

27:50.002 --> 27:52.088
I became
the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.548
because I believe in their mission.

27:55.174 --> 27:59.011
<i>Protecting and integrating Inhumans
is part of that.</i>

28:00.304 --> 28:04.392
Senator, I promise you
that I am the man for the job,

28:05.184 --> 28:09.146
because I'm not just a man.
I'm an Inhuman.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.483
<i>Director Mace,
just to be sure I'm hearing you correctly,</i>

28:12.566 --> 28:15.069
<i>you're saying you are literally Inhuman?</i>

28:15.236 --> 28:17.947
<i>Yes. I'm an Inhuman.</i>

28:19.448 --> 28:23.411
You know, my life didn't just change
when that bomb went off in Vienna

28:23.494 --> 28:26.038
or when I shielded
that woman from harm.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.458
It also changed
when I went through Terrigenesis.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.169
So, yeah, this is personal.

28:32.586 --> 28:36.215
And people like me that are different
should not be hunted down.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.347
<i>I'm sorry,
but it's the fastest way in.</i>

28:45.182 --> 28:47.351
Yeah, and, um,
you're looking for the chute

28:47.685 --> 28:49.562
<i>- in the northwest corner.</i>
- Got it.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.022
Whoa.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.108
- Guess it really is Taco Tuesday.
- Yeah.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.569
You know, you never did tell me
what you saw when you died.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.945
Really? Now?

28:58.028 --> 28:59.780
Is it because it smells
like death in here?

28:59.864 --> 29:01.198
You saw something.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.492
- You want to know what I saw, Phil?
- Yeah.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.286
I saw you.

29:06.454 --> 29:07.663
Don't let it go to your head.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.751
You didn't think of that
before I jumped in the trash?

29:11.834 --> 29:13.043
What's the fun in that?

29:14.378 --> 29:15.671
Finish her!

29:19.467 --> 29:20.551
You're done!

29:34.315 --> 29:36.567
It's been a while
since I stretched my legs.

29:41.697 --> 29:45.201
- That was suicidal and stupid.
- You weren't supposed to come back for me.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.661
- We just saved your life!
- And risked your own!

29:48.204 --> 29:49.497
I never asked for that.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.082
Let's argue about who should've left
who to die later. You need a medic.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.168
- I'll be fine...
- Fine? No. You won't.

29:54.251 --> 29:56.712
Fitz, what's the status
on Eli Morrow?

29:56.796 --> 29:58.672
Quinjet's on its way to the yard
for extraction.

29:58.756 --> 30:00.299
<i>Mack has him in his custody.</i>

30:11.393 --> 30:12.812
The exit's just ahead.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.987
Hey. A little help here.

30:22.071 --> 30:24.406
All right, get Eli out of here!
I'll be right behind you.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.367
Stand back.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.469
Hey! Come on.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.228
Hey. Robbie.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.148
Just keep going. S.H.I.E.L.D.
will meet you out in the yard.

30:58.232 --> 31:00.651
- What about you?
- I got one last thing to take care of.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.863
Go. I'm right behind you!
Go!

32:50.678 --> 32:51.762
No.

34:00.622 --> 34:03.000
They'll get you set up,
lead you back inside.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.547
Where's Eli Morrow?

34:09.630 --> 34:11.550
I sent him out with Robbie.
He should be out here.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.766
Where's my uncle?

34:18.849 --> 34:20.641
He's supposed to be with you.
What the hell happened?

34:28.233 --> 34:31.527
Move, or I will take your mind apart
piece by piece.

34:39.828 --> 34:43.248
Mace, that confession
of yours was unbelievable!

34:43.331 --> 34:45.918
You were a hero to people
before you had super-strength.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.837
But now your approval numbers
are through the roof.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.924
Thanks, Burrows.
Uh, if you don't mind...

34:52.007 --> 34:54.426
Of course. Huh?

34:55.385 --> 34:57.221
Well, sounds like you were a hit.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.681
Oh, this is your victory, too,
Agent Simmons.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.309
You were a great help.
It's like I always say,

35:02.392 --> 35:04.812
a team that trusts
is a team that triumphs.

35:04.895 --> 35:08.899
But trust must be earned
with random, non-invasive testing.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.317
Your...

35:10.984 --> 35:14.279
Your polygraph this morning
generated some alarming results,

35:14.363 --> 35:17.533
so I'd like you
to give it another go.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.164
About that.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.627
Do you happen to know
what a micro-expression is?

35:28.710 --> 35:31.755
The dart of an eye,
tensing of forehead,

35:31.839 --> 35:33.298
the littlest thing can say a lot.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.926
More specifically,
they can say if a person is lying.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.306
What are you getting at?

35:41.807 --> 35:44.726
I don't think you want me
to strap back into that machine.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.230
He may ask me what I thought

35:48.313 --> 35:49.982
of that story
you told on television today.

35:50.524 --> 35:53.026
You know, the one about
becoming a hero in Vienna?

35:54.862 --> 35:56.864
Because if asked,
I would have to tell the truth,

35:56.947 --> 35:58.866
which we both know
you didn't do.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.288
Harlan.

36:05.247 --> 36:07.708
I'm gonna exempt Agent Simmons
from any further testing.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.751
Thank you, sir.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.671
He's right, you know.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.507
A team that trusts
is a team that triumphs.

36:30.731 --> 36:33.984
If you're looking for Robbie,
he's off hating himself somewhere else.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.068
Good.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.279
I came to see you.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.908
- The arm is fine.
- I didn't ask.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.330
I know what you're doing.

36:47.456 --> 36:49.416
Trying to distance yourself
from everyone else

36:49.499 --> 36:50.959
so they don't drown in your wake?

36:51.752 --> 36:53.337
I invented that move.

36:54.421 --> 36:58.217
It doesn't work
for one simple reason.

37:01.094 --> 37:02.137
Phil Coulson.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.019
He found me in that cubicle
and dragged me out.

37:09.645 --> 37:13.482
He didn't give up on me
and he won't give up on you.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.109
- I never wanted that.
- Mm-hmm. No.

37:16.193 --> 37:18.111
You don't get to choose
who cares about you.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.156
And Coulson...

37:23.408 --> 37:24.993
he's got a bigger heart than most.

37:36.004 --> 37:39.841
Lincoln wouldn't want you
killing yourself over what happened.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.977
I promised to Coulson
I'd see this operation through.

37:51.270 --> 37:52.604
After that, I'm gone.

38:17.254 --> 38:19.256
- Daisy? What'd you say to her?
- Mm-hmm.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.091
Nothing she didn't already know.

38:21.174 --> 38:22.509
Well, we're gonna need her.

38:23.010 --> 38:24.886
Fitz found Eli Morrow and Dr Bauer

38:24.970 --> 38:27.180
on the security-cam footage
outside the prison.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.557
Hmm.

38:29.099 --> 38:30.642
- She didn't kill him.
- No.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.186
She forced him to leave with her
in an ambulance.

38:33.729 --> 38:36.398
- What does she want with him?
- I don't know.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.484
But I got a feeling
he's about to find out.

39:04.426 --> 39:05.886
What do you want me to do?

39:09.931 --> 39:11.058
Read it.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.685
'Cause I can't.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.188
Lucy...

39:17.022 --> 39:18.899
We are going to fix me...

39:20.609 --> 39:22.611
and then finish what we started.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.862
Don't see why this couldn't have
been a phone call.

40:07.489 --> 40:10.117
Never underestimate
the power of human connection.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.285
Or should I say "Inhuman"?

40:12.702 --> 40:13.620
Hmm.

40:14.329 --> 40:16.832
Either way, congratulations
on those poll numbers.

40:17.541 --> 40:18.792
I have you to thank.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.336
You gave me no option
but to tell the truth.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.005
Speaking of the truth,
I went looking for some,

40:24.381 --> 40:25.841
and guess what I found?

40:28.301 --> 40:30.887
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. working
with a former Agent

40:30.971 --> 40:34.266
now known as Quake,
a walking weapon of mass destruction.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.770
This one was new to me.

40:41.356 --> 40:44.609
New to you, too, I see.
We're not sure what the hell he is,

40:44.734 --> 40:46.570
but we do know
he's a cold-blooded killer.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.948
Santino Noguera,

40:50.031 --> 40:52.451
a model prisoner looking
at early release.

40:52.534 --> 40:55.954
That is, until he ran
into whatever that thing is.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.583
We know he came in with S.H.I.E.L.D.,
and he left with S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.754
So tell me, are your people aware
they're harbouring a murderer,

41:04.838 --> 41:06.214
or do they just not care?

41:09.342 --> 41:12.012
In two hours, these will go
to ABC News

41:12.095 --> 41:14.222
just in time
for this evening's broadcast.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.559
How do you think those poll numbers
will hold up?

41:28.320 --> 41:29.696
What do you want?
