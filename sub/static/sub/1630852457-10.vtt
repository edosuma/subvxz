00:58.141 --> 00:59.726
It's my fault, Johnny.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.437
-Jesus Christ, they're gonna kill us all.
-Shut up!

01:09.319 --> 01:12.447
Hey. Hey, hey, get your shit together.
All right? Look at me.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.495
The only thing you gotta worry about
right now is survival.

Besides, it's not your fault, man.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.674
It's mine.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.677
[captain] You're right
about one thing, Kreese.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
It is your fault we're in here.

01:37.305 --> 01:41.392
But you're wrong about the rest of it.
He's not gonna survive this.

01:46.856 --> 01:48.983
Captain, come on,
you're the ranking officer.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.735
You looked around, Kreese?

01:50.819 --> 01:52.570
There's no rank anymore.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.239
Not in here.

I had to do it.

You saw.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.667
How deep is that pit, man?

02:47.750 --> 02:48.877
Deep enough.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.547
But that's not the worst of it.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.309
Don't skimp on that sauce.
And get it out while it's hot.

[jazz band plays Christmas music]

We've been here five minutes
and I already see ten people I hate.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.624
-Yeah.
-It's Christmas time, all right.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.042
Tradition is tradition.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.212
Let's just hope Anthony isn't kicked
out of another sleepover.

-I'll grab a table. You grab me a drink.
-Yeah. I'm on it.

03:40.637 --> 03:44.265
Merry Christmas, Brett.
The usual for me and Amanda. Thanks.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.225
Coming right up.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.435
[Ali] Daniel with an L!

03:50.104 --> 03:51.856
Oh, my God!

03:52.941 --> 03:55.151
Ali, is it really you?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.028
I think so. [chuckles]

03:58.321 --> 04:00.990
Wow, I was hoping
that I would run into you one day.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.576
It's funny that it's here though, huh?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.830
Yeah, right. Right. The kid from Reseda,
a member of the club.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.334
Yeah. Well, there's no more sneaking
around the kitchen. [laughs]

04:12.252 --> 04:14.879
I'm sorry, I just… You just look great.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.422
Aw, thank you. So do you.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.176
-I'm so happy to see you. [chuckles]
-Yeah, it's… I…

04:23.554 --> 04:26.391
I just have so, so many questions.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.561
Hey, watch it! I'm wearing white here.
You think I want that all over me?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.106
Johnny, come here.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.152
You remember Johnny Lawrence? Right?

04:40.154 --> 04:41.322
How can I forget?

04:42.699 --> 04:46.411
Wow, guys. This is a little
West Valley reunion, huh?

04:47.328 --> 04:50.707
-Crazy.
-Crazy. That's definitely the word for it.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.918
Yeah. Nice suit.
Is that made of velvet? You sleep in that?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.337
You should talk there, Scarface.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.880
OK.

04:57.964 --> 05:02.093
So I guess this is not the first time
you've seen each other since high school.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.013
-We've had a few run-ins.
-Well, just one or two.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.850
[Sam] I can't say this plainer.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.186
Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do
have to work together.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.814
Even if we wanted to team up,
it'd never work.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.525
I was in Cobra Kai.
Their style mixes with ours like...

05:17.608 --> 05:18.651
Oil and vinegar?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.486
No, not salad dressing.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.531
I would say like the British Bulldogs
and the Hart Foundation.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.701
-They were friends, dipshit.
-Not at WrestleMania 3, Penis Breath.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.038
OK, you can't call me Penis Breath.
Only they can.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.332
Why are you OK
with anyone calling you Penis Breath?

05:32.415 --> 05:35.084
You know what? Screw this.
Come on, let's go.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.045
Hey, pussies!

05:38.546 --> 05:40.965
This is what
those assholes at Cobra Kai want.

05:41.049 --> 05:44.010
Since you were one of 'em,
you're an asshole. So are you.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.346
-[Chris] I ain't no asshole.
-So was I.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.931
Well, at least I wanted to be one.

05:49.891 --> 05:54.145
But now Cobra Kai is the worst
collection of assholes in the Valley,

05:54.228 --> 05:57.023
run by the king of all assholes.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.069
So if by merging with Eagle Fang…
Weird name, by the way.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.364
…can keep us all
from getting shit on anymore,

06:04.447 --> 06:06.783
then we'd all be assholes not to do it.

06:08.159 --> 06:11.162
I'm sorry for all the "assholes."

06:11.662 --> 06:14.457
I usually take pride
in my grandiloquence, but…

06:14.540 --> 06:15.875
it's an emotional time.

[sweeping music plays]

06:25.718 --> 06:28.221
Now… where do we start?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.392
So, your daughter hit his car,

06:32.475 --> 06:34.477
you drew a dick on his face,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.773
your cousin set his car on fire and tried
to beat him up with a baseball bat?

06:38.856 --> 06:41.192
He's playing a little loose
on those details.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.569
-No, that's basically what happened.
-[sighs]

06:43.653 --> 06:45.363
Why didn't you tell me
about this at lunch?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.156
Lunch?

06:47.240 --> 06:50.118
Yeah, we made plans together.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.620
Spent all day together.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.415
And…

06:56.416 --> 06:57.500
how did that happen?

06:57.583 --> 07:00.128
He messaged me out of the blue.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.506
And then she friend requested me.
Kinda went from there.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.968
You know how it goes.
Or maybe not. [chuckles]

07:07.051 --> 07:09.053
So, you finally figured out Facebook?

07:09.720 --> 07:13.891
-Take night classes in computer literacy?
-Self-taught. Many hours.

07:13.975 --> 07:17.437
OK, am I gonna have to put you two
into time-out? [chuckles]

07:17.520 --> 07:19.981
-You get lost on the way to the table?
-I'm sorry.

07:20.064 --> 07:23.860
Honey… Honey,
you are not going to believe this.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.905
-I just stepped in something, didn't I?
-Ali, this is my wife Amanda.

07:27.989 --> 07:32.160
-Amanda, this is Ali Mills-Schwarber.
-We went out in high school.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.328
Oh! [chuckles]

07:34.412 --> 07:37.623
-I cannot wait to talk to you!
-[laughs] I was thinking the same.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.128
And it's actually just Mills now,
no Schwarber.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.383
Have the man-boys filled you in

07:47.467 --> 07:50.928
on the whole "mortal enemy karate dojo
battle for the soul of the Valley" thing?

07:51.012 --> 07:54.724
Whoa, wait. You both have karate dojos?

07:57.226 --> 07:58.978
-How's that going?
-[Amanda laughs]

08:00.563 --> 08:04.942

combined dojo should train at Miyagi-Do.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.866
Let's go.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.968
Heard you were throwing a party.
Hope you don't mind if we crash.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.805
-Tory, you don't have to do this.
-It's too late.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.765

[playing jazzy Christmas music]

09:36.742 --> 09:39.495
[Amanda] Wait. How the hell
was he dressed as a shower?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.999
-What does that even look like?
-Oh, my God, it was so funny.

09:43.082 --> 09:47.128
OK, and then this one comes out dressed
like a toddler in skeleton pajamas.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.296
[laughs]

09:48.379 --> 09:49.797
-Chasing after him.
-[Amanda] Stop!

09:49.880 --> 09:52.174
OK, maybe we could fast-forward all this.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.926
-Yeah, fast-forward.
-Oh, no, no.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.053
Then it got worse until the tournament.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.557
Then they pretty much left each other
alone, I thought that was that.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.269
So… OK, so their rivalry wasn't the reason
you and Daniel broke up?

10:03.352 --> 10:05.813
No, that was… [chuckles]

10:05.896 --> 10:07.148
…a whole other story.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.983
-No need to go into all that.
-Oh.

10:09.066 --> 10:12.028
-No, I'd like to hear this.
-I think I need to hear it.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.113
[Ali] OK, I'll tell it.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.781
So, I got into UCLA,

10:15.865 --> 10:18.826
and I ran into this guy
that I knew who went there.

10:18.909 --> 10:21.162
Daniel sees me talking to my friend--

10:21.245 --> 10:22.496
Your "friend."

10:22.580 --> 10:25.458
Yes, he was my friend, actually.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.043
He jumps to conclusions.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.464
Well, I was a bit upset,
so I probably maybe egged you on.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.342
Yeah, right. You sure you egged me on?

10:34.425 --> 10:37.386
Listen. I thought
you were in love with the guy.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.846
I told you.

10:38.929 --> 10:43.225
Just like I told you that the brakes
on Mr. Miyagi's car were gonna go.

10:43.309 --> 10:46.479
I hope you didn't tell him
that it was my fault it crashed?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.231
No, of course not.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.860
This is the best story I have ever heard.
Please keep going.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.321
Should we talk about
what a bad boyfriend you were?

10:55.404 --> 10:57.782
-No, that's all right.
-Yes, yes, definitely!

10:57.865 --> 11:00.117
Some shrapnel to that side
of the table, please.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.162
Guess both of our heads
were pretty far up our asses then.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.830
Who's wasn't back in high school?

11:04.914 --> 11:07.375
Mine was so far up there
I could see out my mouth.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.668
[all laugh]

11:08.751 --> 11:11.796
-Did that make sense or was it the wine?
-[Johnny] I dunno.

11:11.879 --> 11:16.008

our kids are more evolved than we were.

Come on, get up. Let's go!

12:10.938 --> 12:12.356
Come right at me, pussy!

Yeah, eat that shit! Get up!

[groans]

13:56.710 --> 14:00.840
I gotta be honest, LaRusso.
I thought you'd put up more of a fight.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.643
Guess I'll have to make my own fun.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.986
[laughs] OK, well, I'm going to go
grab my jacket before I die of joy.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.738
-You are my hero. [chuckles]
-I think you're awesome.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.242
-I'm so glad I got to meet you.
-You too. Johnny.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.743
-Good night.
-Good night.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.663
-I'll go get the tab.
-OK, yeah.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.582
Ah, your wife paying the bills, huh?

14:34.665 --> 14:37.376
Says the guy who grew up
eating free lunches here.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.880
OK, you guys really like
fighting each other.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.883
He's instigating.
I'm just defending myself, as usual.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.885
She knows firsthand that's bullshit.

14:45.968 --> 14:50.472
[scoffs] This is exactly the problem.
You say one thing, you say the opposite.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.392
You both think
there's only one side to the story.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.562
-I know. There's two.
-No, there's three.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.980
There's your side,

14:58.063 --> 14:59.023
and your side,

14:59.690 --> 15:01.609
and then there is the truth.

15:02.401 --> 15:06.655
And the truth is, you guys are more alike
that you want to admit.

15:07.406 --> 15:10.242
Maybe you recognize parts
of yourselves in each other,

15:10.326 --> 15:12.620
and maybe you don't always like
what you see.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.417
I guess it's possible

15:18.500 --> 15:21.837
some small part of all of this
is my fault.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.591
Yeah. Me too.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.051
[laughs]

15:28.010 --> 15:29.011
Point Mills!

15:29.094 --> 15:30.387
[laughs] Winner!

15:30.471 --> 15:34.558
Well, since the match is over
and we have a new champ, I guess…

15:35.643 --> 15:37.061
it's time for me to go.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.776
This was…

15:45.277 --> 15:49.573
I don't even know what it was.
All I know is I had a really great time.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.367
I did too.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.661
I'm so happy I got to see you.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.496
And Amanda!

15:55.579 --> 15:56.455
Yeah.

15:56.538 --> 15:58.248
-Don't screw that up.
-Ah!
