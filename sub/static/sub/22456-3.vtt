00:01.294 --> 00:06.007
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.057 --> 00:09.051
<i>...And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.099 --> 00:13.617
<i>Cos I'm in he-ell...</i>

00:18.384 --> 00:19.659
Big Suze.

00:19.705 --> 00:20.740
Jeremy.

00:20.785 --> 00:24.177
Hi, I thought you might like these.
They're flowers, obviously.

00:24.227 --> 00:27.346
They'll die eventually,
but everything does, doesn't it?

00:27.389 --> 00:28.982
Apart from love, a true love...

00:29.030 --> 00:30.862
A good love can sustain you
all the way through.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.711
It's nice to see you,
but I'm working.

00:33.753 --> 00:35.745
Oh yeah, of course, sure, sure.
Of course.

00:35.794 --> 00:38.628
Well, how about tonight.
I mean, are you free?

00:38.675 --> 00:39.711
I don't know, what are you doing?

00:39.756 --> 00:41.713
Just, Mark's going to Frankfurt,

00:41.757 --> 00:46.072
and I thought, if you fancied,
a magic mushroom party at my place.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.999
Oh, I don't know. Magic mushrooms?

00:49.041 --> 00:51.716
Sounds a bit scary.

00:51.763 --> 00:53.561
Oh, Suze, it's not scary.

00:53.604 --> 00:56.403
You just lose your sense of
who you are, and all that shit.

00:56.445 --> 00:57.959
Will I still be able to play the piano?

00:58.006 --> 01:01.887
Of course. Suze, they're mushrooms,
they're completely natural.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.489
Nothing natural ever hurt anybody,
that's a scientific fact.

01:04.530 --> 01:06.886
I suppose in a way,
it's the sort of thing I should do.

01:06.931 --> 01:10.926
If it's something I don't want
to do, it's something I should try.

01:10.974 --> 01:12.009
Yeah, exactly.

01:12.054 --> 01:15.492
I mean, if people only did
everything they wanted,

01:15.536 --> 01:18.177
everyone would spend all day
sitting on the carpet

01:18.218 --> 01:19.697
watching the Poker Channel,

01:19.738 --> 01:22.812
wanking and eating
those expensive German biscuits.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.897
Probably.

01:27.703 --> 01:31.061
'Oh, I feel awful.

01:31.105 --> 01:33.142
'Still, made excellent time.

01:33.186 --> 01:36.544
'Great bus driver.
Same old route though.

01:36.588 --> 01:40.026
'I should probably alter it
occasionally, evade kidnappers.

01:40.070 --> 01:45.147
'Not much of a risk, but I'd feel
such an ass if it did happen.'

01:45.193 --> 01:46.832
Mark! You're home.

01:46.874 --> 01:50.312
'Why is he so happy? I suppose
I'd be happy if I'd spent

01:50.356 --> 01:53.907
'the day practising my signature and
measuring my knob with dental floss.'

01:53.958 --> 01:58.033
You've only been gone an hour.
What happened? Forget your passport?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.800
I'm ill. Gastric flu.

02:00.841 --> 02:05.042
It's been going round the office,
funny tummy, weird ears.

02:05.084 --> 02:07.645
You're never ill.
Even when you are, you stay at work,

02:07.685 --> 02:10.281
because you believe those adverts
about the man in marketing

02:10.327 --> 02:13.240
stealing your job if you take the day off
rather than buying their horrible products.

02:13.288 --> 02:16.680
I'm not going all the way
to Frankfurt puking and shitting

02:16.730 --> 02:20.168
just to be Tom Finnemore's bitch.
Found out when I got in this morning,

02:20.212 --> 02:22.284
I'm just going to be cueing
up his laptop.

02:22.334 --> 02:25.407
Went out to get some remedies,
and I thought, "Bollocks to this."

02:25.455 --> 02:28.733
Just got to let Johnson know.
How ill do you think I sound?

02:28.777 --> 02:32.374
Well, you look like shit.
But you sound surprisingly chirpy.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.297
What about now?

02:34.340 --> 02:36.810
Yeah, bit hammy.
But then, I'm a stern critic.

02:36.862 --> 02:39.252
This is my whole area.

02:39.303 --> 02:40.783
Bollocks,

02:40.824 --> 02:44.341
he's been on voicemail all morning.
Shall I just leave a message?

02:44.386 --> 02:47.858
No! If you want to convince you're
ill, you have to go mano a mano.

02:47.908 --> 02:50.707
Answerphone is the waster's
dream ticket.

02:50.749 --> 02:53.470
'This is a fucking disaster.

02:53.511 --> 02:56.391
'The sick man of Europe
all over my mushroom party?

02:56.433 --> 02:59.187
'I can't have him coughing mucus
over Suze's lovely face.'

02:59.234 --> 03:03.708
God, I tell you what though, mate,
I think you look OK.

03:03.757 --> 03:04.906
Are you feeling better?

03:04.957 --> 03:05.947
No.

03:05.998 --> 03:08.467
Well, you look a lot better.
I tell you what else.

03:08.519 --> 03:10.796
Today, I'm going
to dedicate myself to you.

03:10.841 --> 03:13.959
I'm going to tend you
and tend you and tend you.

03:14.003 --> 03:15.322
You will go to the ball!

03:15.363 --> 03:18.641
I don't want to go to the ball. I
just want to sit around in my pants.

03:19.926 --> 03:21.804
Hello?

03:21.847 --> 03:23.042
What the...

03:23.088 --> 03:26.765
All right, Mark.
Give us 10, would you?

03:26.810 --> 03:29.723
No! No, I bloody won't! What...

03:29.771 --> 03:32.287
Jeremy! How did you allow this?

03:32.333 --> 03:34.928
- What? I didn't know.
- Didn't know what?

03:34.974 --> 03:37.251
Nothing. What? I don't know,
is there a problem?

03:37.296 --> 03:41.052
You let Super Hans
use my bed for filth.

03:41.098 --> 03:44.057
Oh, no.
They didn't go in there, did they?

03:44.099 --> 03:45.692
Oh, that really is too much.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.811
I'm annoyed now.

03:47.862 --> 03:50.423
I'm so annoyed with them.
That is too much.

03:50.463 --> 03:54.060
Well, where in our massive duplex
did you think they'd be?

03:54.105 --> 03:56.746
In one of the guest suites,
or the billiard room?

03:56.787 --> 03:58.744
I can't get out. Let me out!

03:58.788 --> 04:00.984
It's all right, Hans,
it's just the handle.

04:01.029 --> 04:02.782
It's funny, you need to lift it.

04:02.830 --> 04:05.425
This is bullshit!

04:07.392 --> 04:09.111
Sorry, lads.

04:09.153 --> 04:10.906
Locked doors.

04:10.954 --> 04:14.266
Little switch just flicks, you know.

04:14.316 --> 04:18.392
Since Dad locked me in the airing
cupboard to monitor the home-brew.

04:21.961 --> 04:25.558
'Nice big lock.
Maybe locks and walls aren't cool,

04:25.603 --> 04:28.277
'but they work
for Hadrian and Ariel Sharon.'

04:28.324 --> 04:30.681
What the hell do you call that?

04:30.726 --> 04:31.715
It's a short-term solution.

04:31.766 --> 04:32.882
No, it's not.

04:32.927 --> 04:33.962
Yes, it is.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.479
It can't be a short-term solution,
it doesn't even reach the floor.

04:37.529 --> 04:40.523
Look, Jeremy, I know for you
doing your business in public

04:40.571 --> 04:44.646
is probably some sort of dream come
true, but I can't live like that.

04:44.693 --> 04:45.809
You need to sort this out.

04:45.854 --> 04:49.644
But Mark, I'll never get round
to it. It's Yellow Pages,

04:49.696 --> 04:52.770
I won't use the right words,
they'll realise I'm not proper.

04:52.818 --> 04:54.889
I'll get some cowboy,
and end up on ITV2.

04:54.939 --> 04:56.658
Please, before
you go to Frankfurt...

04:56.700 --> 04:58.657
I'm not going to Frankfurt.

04:58.701 --> 05:01.979
'He's never going to do it.
Where am I going to poo?

05:02.023 --> 05:04.015
'Can't go to Sophie,
she's in Bristol.

05:04.064 --> 05:06.819
'I'll have to go to the pub.
They'll think I'm a junkie.

05:06.866 --> 05:08.903
'I could offer them 50p a poo.

05:08.947 --> 05:11.587
'Too weird.

05:11.629 --> 05:14.588
'No, buy a pint each time,
just become an alcoholic.'

05:14.630 --> 05:17.385
Mark, I'll give you anything
if you'll do it.

05:18.953 --> 05:22.026
All right, I'll bloody do it.

05:22.074 --> 05:23.827
Great.

05:28.838 --> 05:32.230
'What the hell is he laughing
with the carpenter about?

05:32.280 --> 05:35.274
'You have to maintain the barrier,
or they'll retune your radio

05:35.322 --> 05:38.600
'to a commercial station, and force
you to borrow their pornography.'

05:38.644 --> 05:40.681
Brilliant, are you feeling a lot better?

05:40.725 --> 05:42.239
No.

05:42.286 --> 05:44.164
What were you laughing about?

05:44.207 --> 05:46.324
What's he doing,
how much is it going to cost?

05:46.368 --> 05:49.328
It's sorted, Mark. A fair day's work
for a fair day's pay.

05:49.370 --> 05:52.762
Don't give me mottoes,
Jeremy, I want figures, data.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.006
All right, mate?

05:54.052 --> 05:56.693
I've just had a call
from my therapist.

05:56.734 --> 05:58.248
Need to go and have a bit of a chat.

05:58.295 --> 06:01.447
I shouldn't be more than a couple
of hours. Is that all right?

06:01.496 --> 06:04.376
Is that included
within the rate as agreed?

06:04.418 --> 06:06.375
No problem, mate,
I'll have the kettle on.

06:06.419 --> 06:08.092
Sweet as.

06:08.140 --> 06:11.373
How did we get the one carpenter
in Britain with a therapist?

06:11.422 --> 06:15.941
Oh, sure. Therapy's only for you and
Tony Soprano and Jamie Theakston.

06:15.985 --> 06:17.704
The common man needs therapy too.

06:17.746 --> 06:20.136
Yeah, but on my time?
Jeremy, shouldn't you...

06:20.187 --> 06:22.418
Mark, stop, relax, it's OK.

06:22.468 --> 06:24.266
It's fine. You're recuperating.

06:24.309 --> 06:28.464
Have some lunch. Three different
flavours, all mixed up. Exciting!

06:28.512 --> 06:30.629
And then after that, beans.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.585
Until you're better,
I'm going to cook all your meals.

06:32.634 --> 06:36.709
Right. Thanks. Crisps and beans.

06:36.756 --> 06:39.909
'What will come first,
scurvy or rickets? '

06:42.720 --> 06:45.997
It's Johnson. I don't sound
ill enough. Will you take it?

06:46.041 --> 06:49.878
All right. Hi, Alan.
No, it's Jeremy. Look...

06:49.924 --> 06:51.152
Oh, really?

06:52.525 --> 06:55.121
Oh, really?

06:55.167 --> 06:57.124
That is fascinating.

06:57.168 --> 06:59.888
Tom Finnemore's got the lurgy
that's going round.

06:59.929 --> 07:01.443
He's not going to Frankfurt.

07:01.490 --> 07:02.924
Finnemore's got gastric flu?

07:02.971 --> 07:04.803
Johnson wants you to make
the presentation instead.

07:04.852 --> 07:07.447
Oh my God. Me? What shall I say?

07:07.494 --> 07:08.370
Say yes, you big idiot.

07:08.414 --> 07:09.689
But I'm ill, I'm really ill.

07:09.735 --> 07:11.772
You're only as ill
as you think you are!

07:11.816 --> 07:14.890
OK. OK, Tell him I'm up for it.

07:14.938 --> 07:18.090
Don't tell him I'm ill.
Say I've been working from home.

07:18.139 --> 07:20.257
Just tell him I'm coming in.

07:20.301 --> 07:23.180
Alan, he's coming in.

07:23.222 --> 07:25.738
- You da man!
- I'm a man!

07:25.784 --> 07:27.104
<i>It's, "You da man."</i>

07:27.145 --> 07:30.058
Whatever, Jeremy, let's not quibble.
I'm a man!

07:32.027 --> 07:34.178
'Jez comes good sometimes.

07:34.229 --> 07:36.061
'He's not a total arsehole.'

07:36.110 --> 07:40.025
'Mushroom sex party all over
your flat, while you're chomping

07:40.072 --> 07:44.670
'on a bratwurst and dancing to
the oompah band like a total dick.'

07:47.356 --> 07:50.395
'A smiley face from Sophie.
That's all I get?

07:50.438 --> 07:54.035
'A template for a three-screen text
about team leading in Frankfurt,

'I sent her flowers
when she got a new fridge.'

07:59.843 --> 08:02.153
Mark, you really have to make sure
that they...

08:02.204 --> 08:06.803
'Oh God, I feel terrible. Glands in
my neck like a couple of golf balls.

08:06.847 --> 08:09.726
'I've got to look interested,
keep nodding,

08:09.768 --> 08:12.079
'nodding, and a bit of eyebrows.'

08:12.130 --> 08:14.406
Make sure they know
we're playing the game,

08:14.451 --> 08:16.283
<i>but we don't need to play the game,</i>

08:16.332 --> 08:18.688
because we've already won
the game. Yeah?

08:18.733 --> 08:21.374
Oh, yeah, great. Absolutely.

08:21.415 --> 08:23.566
Now, they've got a plasma screen
in their meeting room, so...

08:23.616 --> 08:26.337
'Maybe I can just get
some rest if I get my hand

08:26.378 --> 08:30.737
'so it looks like I'm concentrating,
but actually, grab some micro sleep.'

08:30.780 --> 08:31.531
Mark?

08:31.581 --> 08:32.616
Uh-huh?

08:32.660 --> 08:34.698
Has Sophie been keeping you up?

08:34.741 --> 08:37.736
Oh, sorry.
She's in Bristol, now isn't she?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.059
Probably keeping
some other guy up now.

08:42.506 --> 08:45.865
Yes, no, no, she isn't.

08:45.909 --> 08:48.299
But good joke there, mate.

08:48.350 --> 08:52.311
'When was the last time Sophie
texted you a template, fuckface? '

08:54.033 --> 08:55.786
'He probably thinks I'm a slacker.

'To him, it probably looks like
I've done nothing since lunch.

'and I'm going to be doing that
any bloody minute.'

09:03.158 --> 09:06.995
So, er, do you reckon you'll get it
done soon, like by tonight?

09:07.041 --> 09:08.394
Oh, yeah, piece of piss.

09:08.441 --> 09:09.921
Wicked.

09:09.962 --> 09:13.240
I'm just working.
I'm a musician, this is work.

09:13.284 --> 09:17.803
I can do you a theme while
you're carpenting. Andy's Theme.

09:17.847 --> 09:21.478
My therapist reckons I should
get back into the music.

09:21.529 --> 09:24.488
I used to play drums.
He reckons it'd be a good outlet.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.089
It's cool you've got a therapist.
I mean, what's the big taboo?

09:26.131 --> 09:28.123
There isn't a taboo.

09:28.172 --> 09:30.449
Exactly. What's the big taboo?

09:30.494 --> 09:33.487
Answer - there isn't one.
That's what so cool about it.

09:33.535 --> 09:35.254
There's two types of people, pal.

09:35.296 --> 09:38.688
People who know they've got shit
to sort out, and people who don't.

09:38.738 --> 09:42.130
Oh yeah. Yup, word out.
Truth up, dude. Truth.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.375
'God!

09:43.421 --> 09:45.652
'Look at me, talking to a builder
like we're both on the same level.'

09:45.702 --> 09:47.979
People are so quick to judge.

09:48.024 --> 09:51.541
"Look at him, he's having a look
at his life, he must be a nutter."

09:51.586 --> 09:54.021
Me, I'm like,
"Fuck off, fuck right off!"

09:54.067 --> 09:56.104
Yeah, fuck off!
Fuck off, you idiots.

09:56.148 --> 09:58.903
'Shit, we're so angry together.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.306
'The righteous indignation
of the common man.

'Maybe we could start a union -

'and general persons' union.'

Listen, bro,
do you fancy a bit of a jam?

10:09.075 --> 10:10.555
I've got a bongo,
we could have a cheeky toke.

10:10.596 --> 10:12.633
Yeah, why not? Sweet as.

10:12.677 --> 10:15.273
'Maybe we'll become best mates
and he'll train me up

10:15.319 --> 10:17.151
'to be a carpenter like Jesus.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.274
'And if I get crucified,
he'll start a religion in my name.

10:20.322 --> 10:24.203
'Jeremism. I'm a Jeremist. Nice.'

10:24.364 --> 10:27.517
'I get to sleep on the plane. I can
sleep on the plane. I can sleep.'

10:27.566 --> 10:29.876
So, we'll get a chance to storm
our brains off on the plane.

10:29.927 --> 10:31.805
Right, great.

10:31.848 --> 10:35.559
'I can go to the little loo, put my
jacket on the seat like a cushion,

10:35.610 --> 10:36.600
'and make out I got locked in.'

10:36.651 --> 10:38.370
Mhhhello?

10:38.412 --> 10:41.690
Oh, for God's sake. All right.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.772
Flight's delayed.
Industrial action in Frankfurt.

10:44.815 --> 10:45.885
Next one's 7 am.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.647
So we'd better... 'Don't say
brainstorm, don't say brainstorm.'

10:49.698 --> 10:52.851
Get some rest. You wanna be fresh
for the big meet, don't you?

10:52.900 --> 10:54.254
You take this one.

10:54.301 --> 10:58.660
'God bless those over-unionised
European economies.'

11:01.345 --> 11:04.543
'Magic eye.
Brilliant for a 'shroom party,

11:04.587 --> 11:06.977
'just as long as it's
something nice when you get it.

11:07.028 --> 11:10.147
'Yeah, they won't do
a magic eye of executions.

11:10.190 --> 11:12.785
'It'll be dolphins
or Father Christmas.'

11:12.831 --> 11:13.947
Mark.

11:13.992 --> 11:15.346
What are you doing here?

11:15.393 --> 11:19.354
Plane cancelled.
Next one's seven in the morning.

11:19.395 --> 11:22.787
Had a nap in the taxi, but I want
to get some more sleep before...

11:22.837 --> 11:26.548
What the hell have you done
to this place, Jeremy?

11:26.599 --> 11:30.389
Well, I just thought,
why have a boring living room?

11:30.441 --> 11:32.398
Why not have more vibe.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.878
Well, for one thing,
it's a fire hazard.

11:34.924 --> 11:39.317
You've never worried about the vibe
in here before. What's going on?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.927
OK, I'm going to tell
you the truth now,

11:41.967 --> 11:46.009
but only on the condition, the
promise, that you don't freak out,

11:46.050 --> 11:47.689
because this really isn't
a big deal.

11:47.731 --> 11:50.849
In no way the big deal
that you're going to pretend it is.

11:50.892 --> 11:52.406
Jeremy.

11:52.453 --> 11:56.130
It's just, Big Suze and everyone,
they're coming over.

11:56.175 --> 11:58.213
You might want
to make yourself scarce,

11:58.257 --> 12:00.533
because we're taking
some magic mushrooms.

12:00.578 --> 12:02.012
Magic mushrooms?

12:02.059 --> 12:04.779
Yes, and we're smashing down
the doors of perception

12:04.820 --> 12:06.493
so we can see all the stuff that...

12:06.541 --> 12:07.531
Isn't really there.

12:07.582 --> 12:10.097
That is really there,
but we don't normally see,

12:10.143 --> 12:12.135
because we're so transfixed on...

12:12.184 --> 12:13.618
The stuff that is really there.

12:13.665 --> 12:16.181
Oh, it's so simple for you,
isn't it?

12:16.227 --> 12:19.824
But the truth you're so
scared of hearing is that in fact

12:19.869 --> 12:23.546
reality and fantasy
are exactly the same thing.

12:23.591 --> 12:26.630
Look, Jez, I just
don't feel comfortable

12:26.673 --> 12:29.791
about you having
a drugs party in my flat.

12:29.834 --> 12:32.509
But this is my big chance
with Big Suze.

12:32.556 --> 12:34.309
I'm gonna get us both really high,

12:34.357 --> 12:36.553
and then try to put
my hand up her jumper.

12:36.598 --> 12:37.918
That's your plan?

12:37.959 --> 12:40.839
Yes. And I think
it would be a lot better

12:40.881 --> 12:42.473
if you just stayed in your room.

12:42.521 --> 12:44.001
Why?

12:44.042 --> 12:45.556
Because I'm an embarrassment?

12:45.603 --> 12:48.517
No, it's just you'll be bored.

12:48.565 --> 12:49.554
We'll be off our heads

12:49.605 --> 12:51.996
talking about the amazing things
you can do with hemp,

12:52.047 --> 12:56.247
not the interest rates
and grisly murders that you're into.

12:56.289 --> 12:57.643
Look, please, Mark.

12:57.690 --> 13:00.843
Please promise to stay
in your room all night.

13:00.892 --> 13:03.088
No.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.774
It's my flat and I feel ill.

13:05.815 --> 13:09.286
I just want to lounge around in
my pants and watch Judge John Deed.

13:09.337 --> 13:12.136
Can't you and your friends cope
with the sight of me

13:12.178 --> 13:13.931
lounging around in my pants?

13:16.180 --> 13:19.970
Listen, the door's almost finished,
but I've just had a call from my ex.

13:20.023 --> 13:21.456
She's dumping the kids on me,

13:21.503 --> 13:25.020
some bullshit about needing to get her head
space together. I'm gonna shoot off.

13:25.065 --> 13:27.456
- Yeah, well, actually...
- Great, thanks, mate.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.146
He's trying to diddle us. >

13:29.188 --> 13:31.828
There are girls coming over
to take 'shrooms.

13:31.869 --> 13:34.020
They'll have to go
to the loo in public.

13:34.070 --> 13:36.108
Well, then, you'd better
tell him yourself.

13:36.152 --> 13:39.145
Oh, for God's sake.

13:44.476 --> 13:47.709
Look, sorry, mate,
it's actually not cool.

13:47.758 --> 13:48.714
What's that?

13:48.759 --> 13:51.638
The door. It might be best
if you finish it tonight.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.796
No, pal, I've gotta get over...

13:52.841 --> 13:54.992
It's just Mark, my mate.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.352
He's a bit of a carrot up the
old arse about this kind of thing.

13:57.403 --> 13:59.999
I don't mind, it's fine by me.

14:00.045 --> 14:03.323
Well, anyway, look, I really need it
done by tonight, OK?

14:03.367 --> 14:04.482
I'm off, pal.

14:04.527 --> 14:08.443
Look, you've got to just do it now,
OK? It's your job.

14:08.490 --> 14:12.326
I'm ordering you to do it.
I'm the boss, you're the worker.

14:12.372 --> 14:14.170
Yeah? That's the way it is, is it?

14:14.213 --> 14:17.446
Well, you can fuck off, pal!
You can fuck right off!

14:17.495 --> 14:19.532
'Please don't hit me.

14:19.576 --> 14:21.647
'Good, he hasn't hit me.
Maybe I should hit him.

14:21.697 --> 14:23.290
'Oh no, he's gone.'

14:24.979 --> 14:26.777
I'm going for a power nap.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.620
I'll be back out later to look at
these training videos,

14:29.662 --> 14:33.623
so I'll need the living room. If
you must trip, you can trip in here,

14:33.664 --> 14:35.895
in your room and a bit in the hall.

14:36.826 --> 14:40.298
'This is a nightmare.
We can't all sit in my bloody room.

14:40.348 --> 14:43.659
'What if one of us goes out and
sees him? immediate bad vibe.

14:43.709 --> 14:47.181
'Hold on.' It's all right, Mark.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.827
I'll take your Lemsip through
for you.

14:49.873 --> 14:51.592
Oh, cheers, mate.

14:51.634 --> 14:53.193
'Am I going to do this?

14:53.235 --> 14:57.025
'Am I going to do this? I've got an
evil plan. I'm like a Bond villain,

14:57.077 --> 15:00.469
'or a young Richard Branson.

15:00.519 --> 15:05.596
'I'm sort of poisoning my flatmate.
Is that OK? Doesn't sound great.

15:05.642 --> 15:09.557
"'Why did you poison your flatmate?"
"So I could have a party."

15:09.604 --> 15:11.641
'I'm only poisoning him a tiny bit.

15:11.685 --> 15:15.362
'It's really a white poisoning,
a friendly poisoning. It's just so

15:15.407 --> 15:18.799
'much more civilised than bonking him
on the head with a hammer.'

15:18.849 --> 15:20.727
Hi, mate.

15:20.770 --> 15:23.332
Oh, thanks.

15:23.412 --> 15:27.123
'Shit. Could this actually kill him?
It's not going to kill him.

15:27.174 --> 15:30.566
'It's just loads and loads of
medicine. He'll probably wake up

15:30.616 --> 15:34.133
'in three days, completely cured.'
You should drink all that down.

15:34.178 --> 15:35.737
OK, thanks.

15:35.779 --> 15:38.055
I will.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.500
That's right.

15:39.541 --> 15:41.931
Drink it all down.

15:41.982 --> 15:45.738
OK. Have a nice nap.

15:45.784 --> 15:47.104
Thanks.

15:47.145 --> 15:52.586
'It'll be OK. It's not like
I'm going to rape him.

15:52.628 --> 15:54.221
<i>'I could rape him.</i>

15:54.269 --> 15:56.830
'I'm not going to rape him.'

15:59.352 --> 16:01.913
Ever gone 'shrooming before?

16:01.953 --> 16:03.467
No, never.

16:03.514 --> 16:07.509
My friend, Otto, had a very bad
trip the first time he did it.

16:07.556 --> 16:11.598
He ended up putting his forehead
on a train track, thinking it was

16:11.639 --> 16:13.278
a big steel sweatband.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.233
Don't worry.
Tripping changed my life.

16:16.281 --> 16:20.914
Before I did 'shrooms, I was stuck
at HSBC, doing the nine to five.

16:20.964 --> 16:23.240
Now you've got your
room at the centre,

16:23.285 --> 16:25.322
and you're making your masks.

16:25.366 --> 16:28.440
Jez, I need to use the loo.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.799
Yeah, sorry about that.
What I was thinking was,

16:30.850 --> 16:34.481
I'll just wedge the door
in and hold it while you...

16:34.532 --> 16:36.330
I won't be listening or anything.

16:36.373 --> 16:39.446
I'll hear, but I won't listen.

16:39.494 --> 16:42.613
OK, you go ahead
and do your lovely business,

16:42.656 --> 16:44.807
and I'll jam this sucker in place.

16:44.857 --> 16:48.329
'I bet she even does nice poos,
little Maltesers that smell like

16:48.379 --> 16:52.375
'the Body Shop.
Just go and check on the victim.

16:52.422 --> 16:54.937
'Not victim, patient.
Patient's nicer.

16:54.983 --> 16:57.783
'He's fine.
Mustn't think I've killed him.'

16:57.825 --> 17:02.503
'Definite bad trip. I almost
certainly haven't killed him.

17:02.547 --> 17:05.268
'Might be best if I just...

17:05.309 --> 17:08.587
'No need to think about
what I'm doing too much...

17:08.631 --> 17:13.184
'Out of sight, out of mind.
Brilliant.'

17:15.954 --> 17:19.551
'I feel terrible. I feel like
someone's trying to deliver

17:19.597 --> 17:23.387
'the whole of the Sunday Times
into my head.

17:23.439 --> 17:27.480
'Sophie can't even be bothered to
send me templates any more.

17:27.521 --> 17:31.676
'Just go to the loo and then...
What?

17:31.724 --> 17:36.847
'He's... Has he... locked me in?!
This is incredible!

17:36.887 --> 17:40.484
'This is literally unbelievable!
I'm locked out of a party

17:40.529 --> 17:45.082
'that's happening in my own home!
It's Sarah's 18th all over again.

17:45.131 --> 17:49.412
'A mushroom party in my flat is
not in the tenant's agreement!

17:49.454 --> 17:53.051
'Of course, I never made him sign
a tenant's agreement. Bollocks.

17:53.096 --> 17:56.534
'This is the last friendship I have
that's not backed up by a legally

17:56.578 --> 17:58.137
'enforceable document.'

17:58.179 --> 18:00.455
Jeremy! Jeremy!

18:01.620 --> 18:03.293
What's that?

18:03.341 --> 18:05.334
- Is that banging?
- Nope.

18:05.383 --> 18:08.342
But I can hear banging.
You can't hear banging?

18:08.384 --> 18:11.264
Don't worry, Suze.
There's no banging.

18:11.306 --> 18:13.696
But I'm definitely getting banging.

18:13.747 --> 18:17.743
My God, I'm hearing things.
I don't think I'm having a good time.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.863
I can't be sure, but I
really don't think I am.

18:20.911 --> 18:22.823
It does sound a lot like banging.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.704
It's this banging track.

18:24.753 --> 18:27.030
That's what's banging.

18:27.075 --> 18:29.271
I think I might get up.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.194
Oh, no.

18:31.237 --> 18:33.706
Suze, have another dose.

18:33.759 --> 18:36.513
That'll sort you out. Maybe.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.679
No, Suze, don't do that. Just...

18:39.722 --> 18:41.156
Listen, love. A little tip.

18:41.203 --> 18:45.039
You're on the edge now and
you need to pick the right way.

18:45.085 --> 18:49.080
Because one way's heaven
and the other...

18:49.127 --> 18:52.087
Well, probably best not to
think about that right now,

18:52.129 --> 18:54.724
but it's fuckin' horrible!

18:54.770 --> 18:56.250
Open up!

18:56.291 --> 18:58.408
Open up, you bloody arsehole!

19:01.454 --> 19:03.173
You bloody... I can't believe you!

19:03.215 --> 19:05.684
Please, be quiet, OK?

19:05.736 --> 19:07.250
Let me out! I need a poo!

19:07.297 --> 19:11.087
Do your business in there
if you have to.

19:11.139 --> 19:12.778
God, you're disgusting.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.300
'Oh, God.

19:14.341 --> 19:19.213
'Can I do this? If I do this, even
if I end up marrying Sophie and we

19:19.264 --> 19:22.895
'live in a detached house in Surrey,
and buy a holiday home in Umbria,

19:22.946 --> 19:26.145
'our children will always look
up at the face of a man who once

19:26.188 --> 19:31.584
'crapped in a takeaway bag. Plus,
I'd have to hide it here somewhere

19:31.631 --> 19:36.344
'in my room next to one of my things.
I could throw it out the window.

19:36.394 --> 19:39.546
'No, that's what they want you to do.
That's where society's headed!

19:39.595 --> 19:42.873
'People shitting in bags and throwing
them out of the window at each other.

19:42.917 --> 19:45.991
'I'm not going to be the first!
Not in my name! '

19:50.482 --> 19:54.477
Jeremy, do you know what? I think
I might be having a good time.

19:54.524 --> 19:57.323
Yeah, these are
the good times, love,

19:57.365 --> 20:00.882
after the initial nausea passes,
but before the grinding comedown.

20:00.927 --> 20:03.363
Lovely.

20:03.409 --> 20:06.926
Jez, do you remember when we used
to have our baths together and you

20:06.971 --> 20:11.603
did your Rick from the Young Ones
impersonation with the rubber mouse!

20:11.653 --> 20:13.930
Yeah, that was a good impression.

20:13.975 --> 20:17.811
Maybe I should run us a bath
right now.

20:17.857 --> 20:18.846
Why not?

20:18.897 --> 20:21.367
'Hot diggity dog! '

20:22.500 --> 20:27.053
The pizza man is here!
Pizza in the bath! Soapy Margherita!

20:27.903 --> 20:31.614
- Jeremy!
- Shut up, Mark! Honestly.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.134
Give me a pizza the action.

20:34.186 --> 20:36.827
Johnson. What do you want?

20:36.868 --> 20:39.827
I wanna see Mark. He called.
He says he's been falsely imprisoned.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.542
Falsely imprisoned!

20:41.590 --> 20:44.186
What a drama queen!
He's not here.

20:44.232 --> 20:46.667
That's bullshit.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.942
What have you done to him?

20:47.994 --> 20:49.553
Nothing. Why would I...

20:49.595 --> 20:50.710
Johnson! >

20:50.755 --> 20:52.428
- Mark?
Johnson!

20:52.476 --> 20:53.830
Mark!

20:55.398 --> 20:58.551
For God's sake. If you're
going to be like that about it.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.759
Thank you, Alan! Thank you!

21:02.802 --> 21:06.513
As for you, Jeremy, you bloody shit!

21:08.165 --> 21:11.637
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Alan.

21:11.687 --> 21:14.283
Where's the door?
Are you all right?

21:14.329 --> 21:16.366
Yep. I'm fine.

21:16.410 --> 21:20.166
Just, the door fell out
and we haven't... so...

21:20.212 --> 21:21.885
I need to...

21:21.933 --> 21:24.129
Is that normal pooing you're doing?

21:24.174 --> 21:26.484
Yep.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.855
Doesn't sound normal.

21:27.896 --> 21:29.171
Doesn't smell normal.

21:29.217 --> 21:30.571
It is, honestly.

21:30.618 --> 21:32.974
This is bollocks, Mark.
You know the credo.

21:33.019 --> 21:35.933
Illness equals weakness.
You're off the team.

21:35.981 --> 21:37.130
Please, Alan.

21:37.181 --> 21:39.538
Where's the fire?

21:40.623 --> 21:41.739
Oh, my God!

21:41.784 --> 21:44.060
Stay in that room.
Stay in the nice room.

21:44.105 --> 21:46.905
It's so disgusting,
I'm going to be sick.

21:46.947 --> 21:48.586
Don't be sick, you can't be sick.

21:48.628 --> 21:50.699
Let's dance! Don't be sick.

21:50.749 --> 21:52.342
Look at the magic eye.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.623
What's all this? Jesus!

21:55.672 --> 21:57.504
Is this what you two are into?

21:57.553 --> 21:59.385
Is this your thing?

21:59.434 --> 22:01.995
Sorry, I'm just so sorry.

22:02.035 --> 22:04.597
I'll see you later, Mark.
Much later.

22:04.637 --> 22:06.515
Let's get you out of here.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.277
No, you can't just...

22:08.319 --> 22:10.834
Hang on, love, wait up.

22:15.603 --> 22:17.083
You had to do it, didn't you?

22:17.124 --> 22:18.843
You just couldn't let me be happy.

22:18.885 --> 22:21.719
You had to go crying to Daddy
just as soon as I locked you in

22:21.766 --> 22:24.965
your room for one minute.
You just can't take a joke.

22:25.008 --> 22:26.806
Jeremy, for God's sake.

22:26.849 --> 22:29.490
So, this is my big evening, is it?

22:29.531 --> 22:33.446
Me, tripping my nuts off,
watching you do endless pooing.

22:33.493 --> 22:37.283
If I were you,
I'd think about what you've done.

22:37.335 --> 22:40.613
Just have a long, hard think
about what you've done.
