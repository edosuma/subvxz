WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:04.075
(Water lapping)

00:29.800 --> 00:31.801
Nice street.

00:31.802 --> 00:34.134
I thought you hated
your life in Chestnut hill.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.237
"Hated" is a little
strong. I loathed it.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.038
(Chuckles)

00:39.039 --> 00:40.470
Fancy cars, nice houses,

00:40.471 --> 00:42.472
citywide recognition
as a top neurosurgeon...

00:42.473 --> 00:44.314
What's there to like?

00:44.315 --> 00:45.815
The recognition was nice.

00:45.816 --> 00:48.148
I wouldn't want
to relive the rest.

00:48.149 --> 00:51.421
Oh, and yet you jumped at the chance to take
this case. I still have a few friends here.

00:51.422 --> 00:53.554
I hope this isn't one of 'em.

00:55.186 --> 00:57.187
(Peter) You flying
solo today, bud?

00:57.188 --> 00:58.728
Excuse me.

00:58.729 --> 01:01.391
Uh, Sam's in D.C.
her father's sick.

01:01.392 --> 01:04.394
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

01:04.395 --> 01:06.096
(Camera shutter clicks)

01:06.097 --> 01:08.168
That's Daphne zimmer,

01:08.169 --> 01:10.800
editor of "society
fair" magazine.

01:10.801 --> 01:14.104
You know her? My
mother does. Did.

01:14.105 --> 01:16.106
Really? How well?

01:16.107 --> 01:18.708
Well enough.

01:18.709 --> 01:21.281
Listen, if this is gonna
be too difficult for you...

01:21.282 --> 01:24.455
Death is always
difficult, detective.

01:27.758 --> 01:29.259
Is that Daphne's?

01:29.260 --> 01:31.591
Color looks different
than hers. Better bag it.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.225
Okay.

01:37.368 --> 01:39.199
Well...

01:39.200 --> 01:41.831
What have we got?

01:41.832 --> 01:44.174
The maid found the
body a half-hour ago.

01:44.175 --> 01:46.636
The alarm was off,
no sign of forced entry.

01:46.637 --> 01:49.139
The gate was left open.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.111
There was obviously a
struggle. Mm. Table overturned,

01:52.112 --> 01:55.245
a sandal off her foot.

01:55.246 --> 01:57.817
My guess is...

01:57.818 --> 01:59.549
Daphne was reading here,

01:59.550 --> 02:02.152
someone came
in to Rob the place,

02:02.153 --> 02:04.594
came on Daphne by
surprise, they fought,

02:04.595 --> 02:07.527
and our bad guy vanished
into this morning's traffic.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.160
What makes you think
it was this morning?

02:10.161 --> 02:12.862
Her body's still limp. It hasn't
gone into rigor mortis yet.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.904
I bent the pinkie. That's all.

02:14.905 --> 02:18.468
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:18.469 --> 02:22.172
Discoloration in the
lower right quadrant.

02:22.173 --> 02:24.143
You know what that is?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.376
Bruising from the
attack. It's decay.

02:26.377 --> 02:28.848
But the body's limp. It
hasn't gone into rigor.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.181
She's alreadypastrigor.

02:31.182 --> 02:33.653
The skin is macerated.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.727
She didn't die this morning.
She died at least two days ago.

02:38.389 --> 02:40.530
Thanks for playing.

02:40.531 --> 02:42.462
(Morris) All right, everybody.

02:42.463 --> 02:46.896
Increase the
timeline to 48 hours.

02:46.897 --> 02:49.769
(Peter) Daphne zimmer...
Born in rural Ohio,

02:49.770 --> 02:52.872
educated at Wellesley and
Harvard business school.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.746
Ran a fashion house in New
York, and then came here

02:56.747 --> 02:59.249
to take over "society fair"
magazine 11 years ago.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.912
She became quite a power
player. Why is it whenever a man

03:02.913 --> 03:06.916
calls a woman a "power player," it
sounds pejorative? Uh, your imagination.

03:06.917 --> 03:09.459
(Chuckles) So now
you're patronizing me?

03:09.460 --> 03:13.263
Okay, I'm not playing in this
minefield. You're already in it, pal.

03:13.264 --> 03:16.726
Maceration is consistent
with her position in the water,

03:16.727 --> 03:18.628
so she wasn't moved.

03:18.629 --> 03:22.732
And she was out in the
open air for at least two days

03:22.733 --> 03:25.975
near a garden.

03:25.976 --> 03:27.737
So...

03:27.738 --> 03:29.979
When there's a garden,
there's entomology,

03:29.980 --> 03:32.482
and when there's
entomology, there's...

03:32.483 --> 03:36.316
Curtis, just in time. I
have a present for you.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.550
And don't worry.
He's got friends.

03:41.492 --> 03:45.625
Second-stage calliphoridae.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.996
Hmm?

03:46.997 --> 03:49.228
Blowfly maggots to you.

03:49.229 --> 03:53.303
By my estimate, she's been
dead for at least two days.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.305
How fast can you confirm that?

03:55.306 --> 03:57.307
Well, there are six
stages from eggs to adult.

03:57.308 --> 03:59.439
I'd need to grow
these little guys out,

03:59.440 --> 04:02.512
then calculate backwards. 20 days,
maybe 25. How about tomorrow?

04:02.513 --> 04:05.345
I'll do my best.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.547
Mm-hmm. Oh, a present for Ethan.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.281
This is the only, uh, trace evidence
we found. Tell him I want a full analysis.

04:11.282 --> 04:15.024
Full analysis. Got it. Come
on, little guys. Let's eat.

04:15.025 --> 04:17.757
What else does
that thing tell you?

04:17.758 --> 04:20.630
Uh, Daphne zimmer...
Never married, no kids.

04:20.631 --> 04:22.862
Apparently, that
magazine was her life.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.664
Guess where we're going.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.037
You're not gonna open her up? We
have to wait for the body to dry out

04:28.038 --> 04:30.039
before we make an incision.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.903
In the meantime, let's go find
a match for that hair sample.

04:41.912 --> 04:43.913
(Man speaks indistinctly)

04:43.914 --> 04:46.916
(Telephones ringing)

04:46.917 --> 04:49.489
(Man continues
speaking indistinctly)

04:49.490 --> 04:52.291
(Megan) There she
is... Daphne zimmer.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.292
Modest.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.594
Confident.

04:54.595 --> 04:57.066
I don't see one
hanging over your office.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.668
Yet.

04:58.669 --> 05:02.433
(Indistinct conversations)

05:04.405 --> 05:07.036
(Telephone ringing) The
show must go on, apparently.

05:07.037 --> 05:10.340
Always busy between fashion
week and charity ball season.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.412
I'll take your word for it.

05:12.413 --> 05:14.043
Coming through.
Sorry. It's okay.

05:14.044 --> 05:17.316
Can I help you? We need
to see who's in charge here.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.990
I don't know if I can get her right now.
She's in a meeting. Who's in a meeting?

05:20.991 --> 05:23.453
Daphne. Are we talking
about the same person?

05:23.454 --> 05:27.056
Hang on a sec. Daphne
zimmer, the head of the magazine.

05:27.057 --> 05:29.829
Her meetings are epic.
She might be a while.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.332
She might bealotlonger
than you think.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.665
(Fabric snaps)

05:35.666 --> 05:37.738
♪♪♪

05:57.658 --> 06:00.359
(Morris) I see a lot
of anxious people,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.532
not a lot of grief.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.864
Well, they just found
out their boss died.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.365
They're probably in shock.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.868
Either that or work
has taken its toll.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.570
Look at these people.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.443
He's got rhinophyma...
Tip O'Neill nose.

06:13.444 --> 06:15.945
Heavydrinker.

06:15.946 --> 06:18.978
She bites her nails, wears
acrylics to cover up the damage.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.751
Chews jewelry... keeps
the nails out of the mouth.

06:21.752 --> 06:24.984
And he has got trichotillomania.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.486
Trichto... what?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.987
Compulsive hair puller.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.591
And he's just fidgety.

06:31.592 --> 06:35.124
You are looking at some
serious signs of stress.

06:35.125 --> 06:38.928
In other words, somebody
wanted the boss dead,

06:38.929 --> 06:41.532
and I am looking at a
room full of suspects.

06:47.878 --> 06:50.811
Excuse me. Who's
Daphne's assistant?

06:52.543 --> 06:54.514
Oh...

06:54.515 --> 06:56.045
Let's start with him.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.047
(Peter and man
speak indistinctly)

06:58.048 --> 07:01.651
Hey. Kate Murphy
returning your call.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.653
Sorry we keep playing phone tag.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.655
Um, I'm at the office now,

07:05.656 --> 07:07.927
but you could always
call me on my cell.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.729
(Clears throat)

07:09.730 --> 07:13.132
I didn't hear anything. Next
time, try knocking. (Clears throat)

07:13.133 --> 07:15.805
Right. Sorry. Knock. I'm pulling
you off the mackavoy case.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.967
I want you to focus
on Daphne zimmer.

07:17.968 --> 07:20.770
What do you have so
far? About... the hair?

07:20.771 --> 07:23.573
That Curtis gave
me half an hour ago?

07:23.574 --> 07:25.074
That's right.

07:25.075 --> 07:27.917
It's human.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.579
And?

07:29.580 --> 07:32.482
It's human. (Gulps)

07:32.483 --> 07:34.453
Daphne zimmer was
very well-respected

07:34.454 --> 07:35.955
in this community.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.957
A lot of people are
asking questions,

07:37.958 --> 07:40.089
and you have the only trace
evidence from the crime scene

07:40.090 --> 07:42.191
connected to the
killer. So top priority.

07:42.192 --> 07:46.736
Start with the roots of the
hair, look for any d.N.A. Okay.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.738
(Sighs)

07:48.739 --> 07:50.099
(Clicks keypad buttons)

07:50.100 --> 07:52.471
Let me get this straight.

07:52.472 --> 07:56.075
You told the interns to say
Daphne was in a meeting?

07:56.076 --> 07:59.679
It's the standard blowoff when
we didn't know where she was.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.012
So she was in the habit of going missing? Mm-hmm.
For days at a time. We've all come to expect it,

08:03.013 --> 08:05.214
and it's my job
to cover for her.

08:05.215 --> 08:08.257
Yeah, you were her first
assistant, her gatekeeper.

08:08.258 --> 08:10.920
And... (Chuckles) You
didn't know where she went?

08:10.921 --> 08:14.063
(Laughs) Uh... St. barths,

08:14.064 --> 08:15.565
the vineyard.

08:15.566 --> 08:18.568
It's a, uh, society magazine.

08:18.569 --> 08:20.630
Daphne went out to society.

08:20.631 --> 08:24.503
Uh, but she was paranoid about
anybody knowing her schedule.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.006
But you set her schedule,
didn't you? In the office, yeah.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.908
Daphne trusted me,

08:28.909 --> 08:31.080
and we got along great,

08:31.081 --> 08:33.983
but she didn't
tell me everything.

08:33.984 --> 08:37.516
So when was the last time
you had contact with her?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.849
Five days ago. We
spoke on the phone.

08:39.850 --> 08:43.052
And I haven't seen or
heard from her since.

08:43.053 --> 08:45.054
(Elevator bell dings,
cell phone rings)

08:45.055 --> 08:47.557
It appears that your hair
twirler, Stephen burkett,

08:47.558 --> 08:49.859
was the last person
to see Daphne alive.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.861
That was five days
ago, so if we're saying...

08:51.862 --> 08:54.864
(Cell phone ringing) That she
died two days ago, that's a lot of time

08:54.865 --> 08:57.006
that's unaccounted
for, and... Peter.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.009
(Beeps)

09:01.712 --> 09:03.973
Hi, mom. Hey.

09:03.974 --> 09:06.746
Did you hear about
Daphne? Yes, I did.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.278
Oh, boy, I'm gonna miss
her. We were so close.

09:09.279 --> 09:12.281
I know. I'm very sorry.
Then tell me what you know.

09:12.282 --> 09:15.024
Mom, you know I
can't tell you anything.

09:15.025 --> 09:17.026
Well, at least let
me see you tonight.

09:17.027 --> 09:18.628
I could do with some company.

09:18.629 --> 09:21.030
Uh... Listen, the club is
having a black-tie social.

09:21.031 --> 09:24.163
Will you come? The last
time you made me go,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.996
you paraded me in
front of 30 of your friends,

09:26.997 --> 09:29.568
and all they did
was ask about Todd.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.601
Megan, please.

09:31.602 --> 09:33.873
I'm sorry, mom. I...

09:33.874 --> 09:35.875
I have a killer to catch.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.046
(Beep)

09:37.047 --> 09:40.080
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

09:43.814 --> 09:45.254
How was your mom?

09:45.255 --> 09:48.988
She wants me to go to
some god-awful club dinner.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.020
Sounds like real quality time.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.923
No time with my
mother is quality time.

09:53.924 --> 09:56.926
What are you looking for?

09:56.927 --> 10:00.369
You know how your skin prunes
up when you take a bath? Mm-hmm.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.132
When a waterlogged
body dries out,

10:03.133 --> 10:05.374
the skin smooths,

10:05.375 --> 10:09.639
revealing marks that were
sometimes overlooked...

10:09.640 --> 10:12.982
Like those.

10:12.983 --> 10:14.243
Mm. Nail marks.

10:14.244 --> 10:15.985
From the struggle?

10:15.986 --> 10:18.087
Maybe.

10:18.088 --> 10:20.750
Bruising can show
up to a week later.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.853
Bring down that light, will you?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.627
They're square.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.400
And thicker than normal.

10:31.401 --> 10:33.664
Acrylics.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.367
Is bud still at the magazine?

10:39.139 --> 10:42.842
Daphne was a, uh... (Sniffles)

10:42.843 --> 10:45.074
Force of nature.

10:45.075 --> 10:48.147
I just... I can't
believe she's dead.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.149
(Morris) Did you know her long?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.952
Uh... 11 years.

10:52.953 --> 10:56.255
I was, uh, office manager
when she came on as editor.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.658
Would you say that you
and she were friends? Yeah.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.190
Would you mind explaining

11:01.191 --> 11:04.234
why your nail marks
are on her body?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.437
Uh...

11:08.438 --> 11:12.201
Every year, uh, Daphne
let her top writers

11:12.202 --> 11:14.744
enter this, uh, city
journalism competition

11:14.745 --> 11:16.045
that she'd won.

11:16.046 --> 11:19.749
Um, and this year, she
opened it up to everybody...

11:19.750 --> 11:22.081
The assistants, the interns...

11:22.082 --> 11:24.453
And this copy editor complained.

11:24.454 --> 11:28.057
You don't complain to Daphne.

11:28.058 --> 11:32.461
She went ballistic. I
had to pull her off of him.

11:32.462 --> 11:34.063
Did it botheryou,

11:34.064 --> 11:38.027
her, uh, opening
it up to everyone?

11:38.028 --> 11:40.900
High society is
a cutthroat world.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.173
I don't have what Daphne has.

11:44.174 --> 11:47.436
Evenshewas always
looking over her shoulder

11:47.437 --> 11:50.339
for someone trying to take
her down. Anybody in particular?

11:50.340 --> 11:53.012
Oh, pick a name.

11:53.013 --> 11:56.316
But she had her own
way of watching her back.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.420
Thank you very much.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.754
Would you mind sending in your
copy editor next, please? Um, sure.

12:04.755 --> 12:08.128
(Sniffles)

12:28.118 --> 12:31.020
No blood or water in the lungs.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.082
No physical signs of drowning.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.524
So we think Daphne
died two days ago,

12:35.525 --> 12:38.057
but we have no
idea what killed her?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.528
Correct.

12:39.529 --> 12:43.262
But I did find kidney damage

12:43.263 --> 12:47.196
and 4-gland
parathyroid hyperplasia.

12:47.197 --> 12:49.338
And that's bad how?

12:49.339 --> 12:51.040
High calcium.

12:51.041 --> 12:53.002
Symptoms include...

12:53.003 --> 12:55.975
Mood swings, anger, paranoia.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.478
So maybe Daphne couldn't
help her behavior in the office.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.282
Or maybe she could,
and she was just a b-i-t...

13:04.184 --> 13:07.056
You were about to say

13:07.057 --> 13:08.487
"a very powerful woman

13:08.488 --> 13:11.420
who has worked
hard for her success"?

13:11.421 --> 13:16.225
I was about to say maybe
she was abituneven.

13:16.226 --> 13:18.367
Life isn't black-and-white.

13:18.368 --> 13:21.330
Don't reduce Daphne's.

13:21.331 --> 13:25.134
I matched time code
to office phone records.

13:25.135 --> 13:28.137
This is Stephen burkett on
the phone with Daphne zimmer

13:28.138 --> 13:30.109
five days ago.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.912
Oh, the assistant?

13:32.913 --> 13:36.145
(Video playing without audio)

13:36.146 --> 13:39.148
(Woman) Wait for it.

13:39.149 --> 13:42.151
Wait for it.

13:42.152 --> 13:44.253
(Chuckles) Oh.

13:44.254 --> 13:48.227
Oh, Daphne's not the
only one with anger issues.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.230
Nice.

14:03.213 --> 14:05.275
(Remote clicks)

14:07.117 --> 14:10.119
Wow. (Laughs)

14:10.120 --> 14:13.282
(Laughs)

14:13.283 --> 14:15.284
Yeah, I kinda lost it.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.026
Kind of? (Laughs)

14:17.027 --> 14:20.289
(Laughs) Uh...

14:20.290 --> 14:23.362
(Clears throat) I had plans to
go to the shore that weekend.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.334
Uh, it was Friday night.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.036
Daphne tells me

14:27.037 --> 14:30.199
that I have to get a scarf for
the mayor's wife's birthday,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.202
and I spent my whole
weekend in Chicago.

14:33.203 --> 14:35.975
I'm sorry. Uh, time-out.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.108
You went to Chicago

14:39.109 --> 14:41.580
to get a scarf?

14:41.581 --> 14:44.453
(Laughs) I...

14:44.454 --> 14:46.555
Daphne has a favorite
designer there...

14:46.556 --> 14:48.257
Audra Avery.

14:48.258 --> 14:51.260
(Sighs) It was Friday
night. She wanted it Sunday.

14:51.261 --> 14:53.192
Express delivery
was not an option.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.365
That's the most ridiculous
errand I've ever heard of.

14:56.366 --> 15:00.429
(Laughs) I'd snap, too.

15:00.430 --> 15:03.432
I might even ask myself

15:03.433 --> 15:06.175
how I'd get back at that person,

15:06.176 --> 15:08.177
particularly if that
person were keeping me

15:08.178 --> 15:10.179
from my higher calling...

15:10.180 --> 15:14.244
Uh, writing professionally,
gaining recognition.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.319
You think I killed Daphne

15:20.320 --> 15:22.992
over a writing competition?

15:22.993 --> 15:25.354
You had motive, opportunity,

15:25.355 --> 15:28.998
and... plenty of anger.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.000
You want to talk about motive?

15:31.001 --> 15:33.502
Do you have any idea
how many rich people

15:33.503 --> 15:36.165
Daphne's pissed
off in this city?

15:36.166 --> 15:38.638
Try reading a few
of our exposés.

15:48.979 --> 15:50.279
(Knock on door)

15:50.280 --> 15:53.282
Still no d.N.A. On the
hair from Daphne's pool.

15:53.283 --> 15:55.284
My guess is Stephen burkett.

15:55.285 --> 15:59.128
Daphne, uh, sent him to
Chicago to pick up some scarf.

15:59.129 --> 16:02.191
He was really pissed off
about it. When did that happen?

16:02.192 --> 16:04.633
He left four days ago.
Then he didn't kill her.

16:04.634 --> 16:06.335
(Scoffs)

16:06.336 --> 16:09.338
After death, the cells break
down and potassium levels rise.

16:09.339 --> 16:11.340
Daphne's potassium
levels are way too high

16:11.341 --> 16:14.343
for somebody who was
dead for only two days.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.345
So you're saying
that she was killed

16:16.346 --> 16:19.208
while Stephen was out of
town? I will know for sure

16:19.209 --> 16:21.650
when we get a timeline
from Curtis' maggots.

16:21.651 --> 16:23.352
Meanwhile, look at this.

16:23.353 --> 16:25.414
I sectioned a renal artery

16:25.415 --> 16:27.756
looking for the causes
of her kidney problems.

16:27.757 --> 16:29.758
You see that blue material?

16:29.759 --> 16:31.260
Yeah, what is it?

16:31.261 --> 16:33.492
Old suture granulomas from
kidney surgery, and this...

16:33.493 --> 16:35.494
(Clicks keyboard
key, computer chirps)

16:35.495 --> 16:38.497
Is an almost completely
healed fracture of the cheekbone.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.669
I think Daphne's health problems

16:40.670 --> 16:43.132
started after
somebody beat her up.

16:43.133 --> 16:45.134
There's no hospital record.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.676
She took care of it privately.

16:47.677 --> 16:51.010
I'm sure there's a number of
doctors who owed her a favor.

16:52.382 --> 16:54.513
What are those?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.685
Articles. Daphne took
down some very big names

16:56.686 --> 16:58.687
in the past two
years, so I'm guessing

16:58.688 --> 17:01.220
one of these guys was
trying to get revenge.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.592
How long ago do you
think she was assaulted?

17:03.593 --> 17:06.625
Those suture calluses
look about a year old.

17:06.626 --> 17:10.059
September. A month prior.

17:10.060 --> 17:13.362
So...

17:13.363 --> 17:15.134
Colin Lloyd.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.605
The department store magnate?

17:16.606 --> 17:18.137
Mm-hmm.

17:18.138 --> 17:21.740
(Gasps) That affair
was the talk of the town.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.413
Cost him $50 million.

17:24.414 --> 17:28.147
I will look into him. Unh-unh!

17:28.148 --> 17:29.448
(Slaps thigh)

17:29.449 --> 17:32.251
(Sighs)

17:32.252 --> 17:34.354
(Chuckles)

17:36.055 --> 17:39.328
(Curtis) ♪ time for
dinner, little buddies ♪

17:39.329 --> 17:41.530
♪ a-yummy, yummy, num, num ♪

17:41.531 --> 17:43.232
♪ a-yummy, yummy, do... ♪

17:43.233 --> 17:46.165
Could you try not to
enjoy that so much?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.237
Somebody's having a rough day.

17:48.238 --> 17:50.199
(Sighs) It's just...

17:50.200 --> 17:51.600
(Glasses clatter)

17:51.601 --> 17:55.244
There's no roots on the
hair, so no nuclear d.N.A.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.406
It's the only evidence
from the killer,

17:57.407 --> 17:59.408
and I'm a little stressed,

17:59.409 --> 18:01.550
so a little quiet
would go a long way.

18:01.551 --> 18:03.482
Did you hear that?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.214
(Whispers) Eat quietly.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.456
Now I can try to extract

18:07.457 --> 18:09.688
the mitochondrial d.N.A.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.720
From the shaft.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.722
Whoa!

18:13.723 --> 18:15.494
(Normal voice) What happened?

18:15.495 --> 18:19.868
Uh, it... it... it just...
It... it fell apart.

18:19.869 --> 18:21.370
Hmm.

18:21.371 --> 18:25.304
♪ Time for dinner,

18:25.305 --> 18:28.708

(Chuckles)

18:33.883 --> 18:37.386
(Keypad beeping)

18:37.387 --> 18:39.288
So the mysterious hair...

18:39.289 --> 18:42.251
Uh...

18:42.252 --> 18:44.793
It's human, Caucasian,
and really weird.

18:44.794 --> 18:46.795
Traces of arsenic and lead.

18:46.796 --> 18:49.858
The killer has two different
kinds of heavy metal poisoning?

18:49.859 --> 18:52.361
I tested it twice.
It's... it's bizarre.

18:52.362 --> 18:55.204
What about mitochondrial d.N.A.?
Samples are pretty degraded.

18:55.205 --> 18:57.906
You know, bones, teeth,
and hair are sorta your thing,

18:57.907 --> 19:00.909
so I was hoping you
would not mind, uh...

19:00.910 --> 19:03.612
Do your job for you?

19:03.613 --> 19:05.874
I'd settle for "with you."

19:05.875 --> 19:07.577
(Closes folder) Okay.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.321
(Elevator bell dings)

19:12.322 --> 19:13.752
(Cell phone ringing) (Sighs)

19:13.753 --> 19:16.725
Why don't you just go to the
club? She doesn't wantmethere.

19:16.726 --> 19:19.528
She wants methere, in front of her
friends. (Cell phone stops ringing)

19:19.529 --> 19:22.231
Well, maybe today, she
just wants your company.

19:22.232 --> 19:23.692
(Scoffs)

19:23.693 --> 19:26.295
Luke tillman...

19:26.296 --> 19:28.767
Convicted of assaulting
Daphne a year ago.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.869
He only got three months.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.303
How did he pull that off?
Well, Daphne refused to testify.

19:34.304 --> 19:36.405
Three months was
all the d.A. Could get.

19:36.406 --> 19:38.407
Why would she refuse to testify?

19:38.408 --> 19:40.749
It's public. When
you're apower player,

19:40.750 --> 19:43.412
you can't afford to
show your weakness.

19:43.413 --> 19:45.554
So where's tillman now? Dead.

19:45.555 --> 19:49.258
Shanked in prison.
(Chuckles) Convenient.

19:49.259 --> 19:50.559
Too convenient.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.891
Tillman worked in
shipping. Guess where.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.964
Colin Lloyd's flagship store.

19:55.965 --> 19:57.926
How about that?

19:57.927 --> 20:00.269
So he sends tillman
to beat up Daphne,

20:00.270 --> 20:03.232
and then a year later, he kills
her? You've never been divorced.

20:03.233 --> 20:04.873
(Morris scoffs) Amen.

20:04.874 --> 20:07.606
So how do we get to Colin
Lloyd? Oh, don't look at me.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.239
He'll be lawyered
up to the gills.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.940
Peter?

20:11.941 --> 20:13.342
Yeah?

20:13.343 --> 20:15.385
Do you own a tuxedo?

20:33.963 --> 20:36.365
(Man) Here you go, sir.

20:36.366 --> 20:37.667
Oh, thanks.

20:42.812 --> 20:44.813
(Woman) Megan?

20:44.814 --> 20:46.675
It's been ages.

20:46.676 --> 20:48.377
Oh, Suzanne.

20:48.378 --> 20:49.818
(Chuckles) Mm.

20:49.819 --> 20:53.382
Suzanne, this is my
colleague, Peter dunlop. Hi.

20:53.383 --> 20:57.255
Jim and Suzanne pollato. They
own nicoise restaurant. Oh, right.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.558
Colleague? Well,
someone has to be.

20:59.559 --> 21:03.292
What are you doing these days,
Megan? You're a mortician, right?

21:03.293 --> 21:05.434
Uh, medical examiner, actually.

21:05.435 --> 21:07.896
Did you hear about Daphne
zimmer? I'm working on her case.

21:07.897 --> 21:11.340
Oh, good lord. I just decided
to be cremated. (Chuckles)

21:11.341 --> 21:13.342
How about a drink inside, huh?

21:13.343 --> 21:17.346
Good idea. Lovely
to see you both.

21:17.347 --> 21:19.978
(Playing instrumental ballad)

21:19.979 --> 21:22.451
Do you see Lloyd anywhere?

21:22.452 --> 21:24.553
Relax. Act like
you own the place.

21:24.554 --> 21:27.486
I don't even own
this tux, Megan.

21:27.487 --> 21:31.019
Well, speak of the devil. There's
Colin Lloyd himself. (Speaks indistinctly)

21:31.020 --> 21:33.422
(Indistinct conversations)

21:33.423 --> 21:35.394
(Gasps)

21:35.395 --> 21:37.366
And here we go.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.398
Oh, my. Oh! Darling.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.801
I was sure you wouldn't
come. Oh, I was, too.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.933
Hi. How are you? How are you?

21:44.934 --> 21:46.435
And who's this?

21:46.436 --> 21:47.906
Uh... Peter dunlop.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.378
Hello. Hi.

21:49.379 --> 21:51.880
(Man) How are you?
Well, he's marvelous.

21:51.881 --> 21:54.082
We, uh, work together. Of
course you do. (Chuckles)

21:54.083 --> 21:57.346
Brendan, I'd like you to
meet my daughter Megan.

21:57.347 --> 22:01.089
Joan has told me a lot about you. Oh,
I'm sure that was excruciating for you.

22:01.090 --> 22:03.452
Only the good things, dear.

22:03.453 --> 22:07.626
Now there are so many people I want you to meet,
so... Brendan, do you happen to know Colin Lloyd?

22:07.627 --> 22:09.428
(Speaks inaudibly)

22:09.429 --> 22:10.659
Colin? Sure.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.661
Would you mind
terribly introducing me?

22:12.662 --> 22:15.103
Not at all.

22:15.104 --> 22:17.105
(Peter sighs)

22:17.106 --> 22:21.109
(Music continues)

22:21.110 --> 22:23.442
That's very good.
I will say... Colin.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.114
Oh, Brendan. This is
Megan hunt, Joan's daughter.

22:26.115 --> 22:28.116
Ah, how do you do? Hello.

22:28.117 --> 22:31.119
You're every bit as
beautiful as your mother. Oh.

22:31.120 --> 22:35.484
That's an amazing dress. Oh, thank you.
Would you mind taking a photo with me?

22:35.485 --> 22:37.886
Absolutely. I'd be
delighted. (Sets glass down)

22:37.887 --> 22:40.028
(Megan) Peter?

22:40.029 --> 22:42.991
(Music continues)

22:42.992 --> 22:45.834
Ow! What do you know
about Luke tillman?

22:45.835 --> 22:48.667
What the hell? He used to
work for you. He was convicted of

22:48.668 --> 22:52.471
assaulting Daphne zimmer after she ran that
exposé on you. What are you getting at?

22:52.472 --> 22:55.744
You are aware that she was recently
murdered? Megan, what on earth are you...

22:55.745 --> 22:58.507
Are you... are you excusing me? She
cost you $50 million. What happened?

22:58.508 --> 23:02.411
Sending tillman to beat her up wasn't
enough? Who the hell do you think you are?

23:02.412 --> 23:03.712
I'm a medical examiner,

23:03.713 --> 23:06.715
and if I find out you had
anything to do with her death,

23:06.716 --> 23:09.157
I'll nail you to the wall.

23:09.158 --> 23:12.060
Thank you for the
invitation, mother.

23:12.061 --> 23:15.494
I think we're done here.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.766
Joan. I-I don't
know what to say.

23:17.767 --> 23:20.729
You didn't have to
make a scene back there

23:20.730 --> 23:23.432
just to get a hair
sample. Uh, actually, I did.

23:23.433 --> 23:26.435
I had to startle Lloyd enough
to get him to open his eyes.

23:26.436 --> 23:28.907
I noticed these café
au lait spots on his neck,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.909
which are common birthmarks,

23:30.910 --> 23:33.913
but his were rather large,
so then I looked at his irises.

23:36.145 --> 23:39.017
What are those
flecks? Lisch nodules...

23:39.018 --> 23:41.049
Tiny benign
growths on the irises.

23:41.050 --> 23:43.421
They're associated
with a disease

23:43.422 --> 23:47.095
called neurofibromatosis type 1.

23:47.096 --> 23:48.857
Now watch this.

23:48.858 --> 23:50.659
They both have them.

23:50.660 --> 23:54.432
I don't suppose that's a
coincidence. No, it is not.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.965
Timmy akers,

23:56.966 --> 23:59.738
the intern at Daphne's magazine,

23:59.739 --> 24:01.871
is Colin Lloyd's son.

24:03.813 --> 24:05.174
Hmm.

24:23.593 --> 24:25.594
(Morris) You are
Colin Lloyd's son.

24:25.595 --> 24:27.596
Yeah. How'd you find out?

24:27.597 --> 24:29.638
(Megan) You have
your father's eyes.

24:29.639 --> 24:33.071
Akers... your mom's maiden name?

24:33.072 --> 24:36.074
That's right. I want
nothing to do with my father.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.807
Strange timing, you joining
the magazine a year ago,

24:38.808 --> 24:40.649
right after Daphne's
written that article

24:40.650 --> 24:43.151
skewering your father. How
do you think I got this job?

24:43.152 --> 24:44.653
I was the one

24:44.654 --> 24:46.985
that came to Daphne
with the story on my father.

24:46.986 --> 24:49.087
She gave me an
internship in return.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.590
Daphne was assaulted
after that article came out.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.922
Were you aware of that?

24:53.923 --> 24:57.025
I had no idea. But I
wouldn't put it past my father.

24:57.026 --> 25:00.228
You expensed travel to
and from Daphne's house?

25:00.229 --> 25:03.501
You've been there dozens of
times over the last few months.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.775
You must know the house well.

25:06.776 --> 25:08.206
Hold on.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.208
You thinkidid it?

25:10.209 --> 25:11.740
I liked Daphne.

25:11.741 --> 25:15.043
She gave me a chance when no
one else would. She trusted me.

25:15.044 --> 25:17.215
Why? Why did she trust you?

25:17.216 --> 25:18.847
Because I understood her.

25:18.848 --> 25:21.990
She wasn't the monster
people made her out to be.

25:21.991 --> 25:24.823
She needed some help, so
I ran some errands for her.

25:24.824 --> 25:27.295
What kind of errands?
Anything she wanted.

25:27.296 --> 25:30.559
Food, if she was at home,

25:30.560 --> 25:32.100
or books,

25:32.101 --> 25:35.233
or heating pads, a
space heater once...

25:35.234 --> 25:38.066
She was always cold...

25:38.067 --> 25:40.038
And bottled water.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.771
She couldn't drink enough.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.247
Aches, chills, thirst...
They're all connected

25:49.248 --> 25:51.249
to her kidney damage. I
appreciate you teeing up

25:51.250 --> 25:53.281
Stephen and Lauren
and Timmy for me,

25:53.282 --> 25:55.724
but you know what would be even
more helpful? (Elevator bell dings)

25:55.725 --> 25:57.255
A cause of death.

25:57.256 --> 26:00.659
Hell, I'd even settle
for a time of death.

26:00.660 --> 26:04.063
Believe me. No one is
more frustrated than I am.

26:13.342 --> 26:15.303
(Joan) Megan.

26:15.304 --> 26:18.307
(Siren whooping)

26:19.909 --> 26:21.910
Mom, what are you doing here?

26:21.911 --> 26:24.252
I came here because
I wanted to tell you

26:24.253 --> 26:27.015
how disappointed and hurt I
was with your behavior at the club.

26:27.016 --> 26:29.157
(Mouths words) It was graceless,

26:29.158 --> 26:32.290
insensitive, and
wildly inappropriate.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.893
I thought Daphne
was your friend.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.966
And... and besides, Colin
Lloyd... he had it coming.

26:37.967 --> 26:40.268
You think this is
about Colin Lloyd?

26:40.269 --> 26:43.301
You embarrassed me and yourself.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.303
Well, you know, I
don't feel embarrassed,

26:45.304 --> 26:47.876
so I guess it's all about you.

26:47.877 --> 26:51.640
No. It's about my friends.
And Daphne was my friend.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.642
You know I owe her my career

26:53.643 --> 26:56.214
because of the article
she wrote years ago.

26:56.215 --> 27:00.318
You have no idea how
I'm going to miss her.

27:00.319 --> 27:04.392
What a lonely world you
inhabit in that head of yours.

27:04.393 --> 27:06.394
I feel sorry for you, Megan.

27:06.395 --> 27:10.028
You don't know what
it's like to have friends.

27:10.029 --> 27:13.802
(Scoffs)

27:13.803 --> 27:17.265
You know what?
You're right. I don't.

27:17.266 --> 27:20.108
'Cause after my accident,

27:20.109 --> 27:23.171
after I lost my profession,

27:23.172 --> 27:26.945
my standing...

27:26.946 --> 27:28.977
Where were my friends?

27:28.978 --> 27:31.349
Hmm? Where were you?

27:31.350 --> 27:33.381
I was right here for you.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.353
No, you weren't.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.056
You were embarrassed.

27:38.057 --> 27:40.329
You were too worried
about your friends.

27:49.969 --> 27:52.200
(Kate) They're all like this?

27:52.201 --> 27:53.843
(Ethan) Yes.

27:56.045 --> 27:57.346
Thank you.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.180
(Sighs) Well, according
to your analysis,

28:02.181 --> 28:05.083
Daphne's killer
is high on opium,

28:05.084 --> 28:06.454
poisoned by various metals,

28:06.455 --> 28:09.187
and puts resin in their
hair for reasons unknown.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.319
It is an odd series of traits.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.321
Odd? Yeah, the person
is certifiable, Ethan.

28:13.322 --> 28:15.323
All right, let's look
for any contamination

28:15.324 --> 28:16.965
and run another p.C.R.

28:16.966 --> 28:19.197
Let's try to get a match
to some of our suspects.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.199
You got it.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.700
Yes?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.032
Nothing.

28:24.033 --> 28:26.434
It's just, uh, you're
being really nice to me...

28:26.435 --> 28:30.108
Which, don't get me
wrong, it's... it's really great...

28:30.109 --> 28:32.280
But... it can't be
because of me.

28:32.281 --> 28:34.783
My private life is private.

28:34.784 --> 28:36.845
Let's leave it
at that, all right?

28:36.846 --> 28:39.488
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.452
(Sighs)

28:44.453 --> 28:47.725
(Telephone ringing)

28:47.726 --> 28:49.727
Can you fax that for me, please?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.300
Hey. Where's Ethan on
the hair from the pool?

28:52.301 --> 28:53.802
Stuck.

28:53.803 --> 28:56.765
Uh, no matches to Lloyd
or anyone at the magazine.

28:56.766 --> 29:01.109
So no signs of trauma,

29:01.110 --> 29:02.410
no drowning.

29:02.411 --> 29:04.512
She was ill, but not terminal.

29:04.513 --> 29:06.374
(Curtis) Got something for you.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.948
He went from stage two to
stage three just a few minutes ago.

29:09.949 --> 29:12.080
You got a time of death?

29:12.081 --> 29:15.253
This little guy was laid
approximately 70 hours ago.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.857
Wait. So Daphne wasdead
for two days after all?

29:18.858 --> 29:21.359
Yeah. And there's something
strange about this guy.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.192
His growth is stunted.
Is he diseased?

29:24.193 --> 29:26.494
He's high. I tested his family.

29:26.495 --> 29:29.237
They're all full of
acetylsalicylic acid.

29:29.238 --> 29:30.368
Aspirin?

29:30.369 --> 29:33.371
That could spike
her potassium levels.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.274
The last thing you wanna
take for kidney disease.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.547
Unless she didn't know she was taking
it. Only two of these people had access

29:39.548 --> 29:41.249
to Daphne's medical records.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.112
And thanks to Curtis'
bugs, one of them...

29:44.113 --> 29:48.057
Just lost his 4-day alibi.

29:49.288 --> 29:53.362
Hmm.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.339
(Morris) Two days?

30:11.340 --> 30:14.142
Two days? You're positive now?

30:14.143 --> 30:15.443
Bugs don't lie.

30:15.444 --> 30:18.286
So Stephen had time to
come back from Chicago

30:18.287 --> 30:20.818
and kill her with... Aspirin?

30:20.819 --> 30:23.091
Daphne's system was
extremely sensitive.

30:23.092 --> 30:25.894
When Luke tillman assaulted
her, she sustained kidney damage,

30:25.895 --> 30:28.326
leading to secondary
hyperparathyroidism,

30:28.327 --> 30:30.558
leading to hypercalcemia,

30:30.559 --> 30:32.560
causing paranoia
and mood swings.

30:32.561 --> 30:36.564
But the kidney damage
also elevated her potassium.

30:36.565 --> 30:40.940
Promise me when you tell him
that, it'll actually make sense.

30:44.143 --> 30:45.573
(Door opens)

30:45.574 --> 30:49.317
Giving her aspirin was like
throwing gasoline on a fire.

30:49.318 --> 30:52.550
Her potassium levels spiked,
and her heart stopped like that.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.552
Daphne complained of
headaches all the time.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.384
She wanted the aspirin.

30:56.385 --> 30:58.456
Aspirin or other painkillers?

30:58.457 --> 31:00.528
I-I didn't know it
was dangerous.

31:00.529 --> 31:02.290
(Chuckles) Oh, come on.

31:02.291 --> 31:04.432
You screened every call
she took, including doctors.

31:04.433 --> 31:06.434
You mean to tell
me you didn't know

31:06.435 --> 31:09.597
what aspirin would do to her?
No. I had no idea how sick she was.

31:09.598 --> 31:13.201
Stephen... help yourself.

31:13.202 --> 31:15.344
It's time for the truth.

31:21.650 --> 31:26.414
You... you gotta understand.

31:26.415 --> 31:28.356
Every pill I slipped her

31:28.357 --> 31:31.359
was... a day of freedom

31:31.360 --> 31:33.361
from Daphne hell.

31:33.362 --> 31:36.524
She'd stay home, and I
could get some writing done,

31:36.525 --> 31:39.527
which is the only reason
that I put up with her

31:39.528 --> 31:42.530
in the first place. You never
noticed, the more aspirin you gave her,

31:42.531 --> 31:44.302
the sicker she became?

31:44.303 --> 31:46.474
No. Wait a second. I
wasn't trying to hurt her.

31:46.475 --> 31:48.476
(Chuckles) It was only aspirin.

31:48.477 --> 31:52.281
That, my friend, is called
involuntary manslaughter.

32:05.094 --> 32:08.097
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:11.330 --> 32:14.062
Congratulations.

32:14.063 --> 32:18.436
I hear that Stephen
burkett's under arrest.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.569
Oh, I thought
that'd be good news.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.441
Potassium-induced cardiac arrest

32:23.442 --> 32:26.474
is a diagnosis of exclusion.

32:26.475 --> 32:29.217
We know her heart
stopped. We don't know why.

32:29.218 --> 32:32.981
Aspirin's all we got. It's all we need,
along with Stephen's confession.

32:32.982 --> 32:35.723
If Stephen goes to jail
and the killer remains free

32:35.724 --> 32:37.725
because we couldn't
find cause of death,

32:37.726 --> 32:39.487
that's a triple tragedy.

32:39.488 --> 32:42.431
Megan, it's all we
have for the moment.

32:46.265 --> 32:51.469
Just try and take your
mind off the job. Okay?

32:51.470 --> 32:54.072
Look, a bunch of us
are going out tonight.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.244
8:00 at the j bar
on south street.

32:56.245 --> 32:58.207
Why don't you come?

33:00.549 --> 33:03.551
Oh, I don't know if I
can. My mother called.

33:03.552 --> 33:07.015
She wants me to have dinner
with her. She wants a truce.

33:07.016 --> 33:10.019
Then you should do that.

33:12.361 --> 33:13.422
Peter?

33:17.266 --> 33:18.496
Why now?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.228
What do you mean?

33:20.229 --> 33:22.200
I mean, this is the first time

33:22.201 --> 33:24.232
you've ever invited
me to anything.

33:24.233 --> 33:26.704
(Chuckles) Don't
look so shocked.

33:26.705 --> 33:29.408
We just wanna hang
out with you. That's all.

33:35.784 --> 33:38.486
That is it. What?

33:38.487 --> 33:40.318
You are a...

33:40.319 --> 33:41.450
Genius.

33:45.494 --> 33:48.396
(Peter) Did I miss
something? No, I did.

33:48.397 --> 33:52.460
See those? Epicardial petechiae.

33:52.461 --> 33:54.502
Microbleeds around the heart.

33:54.503 --> 33:56.634
From the aspirin, right?

33:56.635 --> 33:58.336
Nope. Now look at this.

33:58.337 --> 34:01.240
(Slide clatters)

34:03.412 --> 34:06.774
See those bands?

34:06.775 --> 34:10.548
Myofiber breakup.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.420
It's extremely rare.

34:12.421 --> 34:15.353
I've only seen one
paper on it. So what is it?

34:15.354 --> 34:18.356
Daphne's heart cells
changed dramatically

34:18.357 --> 34:20.628
in the last seconds of her life,

34:20.629 --> 34:22.630
which means only one thing.

34:22.631 --> 34:24.332
Yeah?

34:24.333 --> 34:27.235
What can stop a heart,

34:27.236 --> 34:30.067
cause microscopic trauma,

34:30.068 --> 34:34.702
and pass for
potassium-induced cardiac arrest,

34:34.703 --> 34:36.804
all without leaving a trace?

34:36.805 --> 34:38.177
What?

34:40.409 --> 34:42.410
(Electricity crackles) (Grunts)

34:42.411 --> 34:45.484
Daphne was electrocuted.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.566
Where there's electrocution,

34:58.567 --> 35:01.530
there has to be an exit wound.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.574
Bring that light
over here, will you?

35:10.709 --> 35:12.180
(Groans)

35:12.181 --> 35:14.512
Everything's on.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.414
It's not the pool outlets.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.186
Main outlets look fine.

35:18.187 --> 35:22.850
No sign of a power surge.

35:22.851 --> 35:25.193
Turn on the garden lights.

35:25.194 --> 35:28.657
(Water lapping)

35:40.669 --> 35:42.510
Looks like a small bulls-eye.

35:42.511 --> 35:46.514
That's where the
current left her body.

35:46.515 --> 35:49.547
Her waterlogged
skin hid the Mark.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.878
Okay, so...

35:50.879 --> 35:53.151
What are these?

35:56.425 --> 35:58.556
Contact burns.
Some kind of grill?

35:58.557 --> 35:59.658
Hmm.

36:02.160 --> 36:07.935
Timmy mentioned buying
Daphne a space heater.

36:07.936 --> 36:09.437
Find out what kind.

36:09.438 --> 36:10.899
Okay.

36:13.272 --> 36:17.275
Alcohol, opium, and arsenic...

36:17.276 --> 36:19.448
(Whispers) Opium and arsenic.

36:21.310 --> 36:22.881
Wait a second.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.687
(Clicking keyboard keys)

36:31.520 --> 36:33.261
Ha! (Slaps desk)

36:33.262 --> 36:35.394
Bingo.

36:40.629 --> 36:42.830
Hmm. Looks like charring.

36:42.831 --> 36:45.633
This outlet's shorted out.

36:45.634 --> 36:47.676
Something was plugged in here.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.840
Finally have some news for you

36:52.841 --> 36:56.284
on that hair from Daphne zimmer's
pool. It was chock-full of everything...

36:56.285 --> 36:57.585
Alcohol, opium, various metals.

36:57.586 --> 36:59.587
We just assumed
it was fresh hair.

36:59.588 --> 37:01.649
Trace alcohol was
actually absinthe

37:01.650 --> 37:04.652
and the opiates were laudanum.
Laudanum? No one uses that anymore.

37:04.653 --> 37:07.555
Add to that high
concentrations of heavy metals,

37:07.556 --> 37:10.558
and your hair is over 100
years old. Possibly victorian.

37:10.559 --> 37:13.861
They used to put hair
in jewelry as keepsakes.

37:13.862 --> 37:15.863
Okay.

37:15.864 --> 37:18.566
These gentlemen are
extremely fashionable,

37:18.567 --> 37:21.539
but only one...

37:21.540 --> 37:23.471
Wears jewelry exactly like that.

37:23.472 --> 37:26.014
I'll tell bud to get a warrant.

37:29.278 --> 37:30.648
(Door closes)

37:30.649 --> 37:33.421
(Morris) So, Ms. Matthews,

37:33.422 --> 37:35.423
it doesn't look good for you.

37:35.424 --> 37:38.426
We pulled this lock of hair
from Daphne zimmer's pool.

37:38.427 --> 37:41.028
And once we match it to
the locket you're wearing,

37:41.029 --> 37:45.593
we can place you at
the scene of the crime.

37:45.594 --> 37:49.697
We were friends. Daphne let me swim in her
pool all summer. I assume you have a key.

37:49.698 --> 37:51.539
Yeah. You wanna see it?

37:51.540 --> 37:53.040
(Door opens)

37:53.041 --> 37:54.542
Where you going?

37:54.543 --> 37:56.345
(Door closes)

37:58.276 --> 38:02.651
How many times a
week did you, uh, swim...

38:04.383 --> 38:06.984
(Door closes) This is Dr. Hunt.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.487
Is your wrist bothering you?

38:09.488 --> 38:10.518
Yeah.

38:10.519 --> 38:13.521
Oh, that's a nasty burn.

38:13.522 --> 38:15.823
Oh, yeah, I just burned
myself in the kitchen.

38:15.824 --> 38:17.466
No, you didn't.

38:19.568 --> 38:22.500
(Chair scrapes)

38:22.501 --> 38:25.503
You went to see
Daphne that morning.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.505
You were pissed. (Gate rattles)

38:27.506 --> 38:29.637
Daphne? Because
you had to compete

38:29.638 --> 38:32.380
with interns for the
journalism award.

38:32.381 --> 38:35.483
I've worked for you for 11 years. I
reward good writing, not seniority.

38:35.484 --> 38:37.985
(Megan) The two of
you fought. I trusted you!

38:37.986 --> 38:40.348
Lauren, get out
of here! You witch!

38:40.349 --> 38:42.990
Daphne grabbed your necklace,

38:42.991 --> 38:45.623
and the lock of
hair fell into the pool.

38:45.624 --> 38:50.097
You thought, 11 years
of service overlooked.

38:50.098 --> 38:52.059
You lost control,

38:52.060 --> 38:54.832
saw the space heater, and...

38:54.833 --> 38:57.735
Threw it in the pool.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.809
No! Don't!
(Electricity crackling)

39:06.415 --> 39:08.477
When you realized
what you'd done...

39:10.549 --> 39:13.482
I'd like to think that
you tried to save her.

39:16.385 --> 39:21.559
You went to unplug the
heater and shocked yourself.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.060
(Electricity crackles) Aah!

39:23.061 --> 39:26.465
And that's when you
burned your wrist.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.568
After the circuit was blown,

39:30.569 --> 39:33.772
you took it out of the pool,
thought you left nothing behind.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.409
But you were wrong.

39:47.516 --> 39:50.588
Rose gold contains copper.

39:50.589 --> 39:53.561
Copper conducts electricity.

39:53.562 --> 39:58.627
That is an electromagnetic
burn on your wrist.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.105
I had, uh,

40:08.106 --> 40:13.581
gone there to complain,
and, uh, she fired me.

40:13.582 --> 40:15.543
(Voice breaks) It
was an accident.

40:15.544 --> 40:17.745
She just... Lauren
Matthews, you're under arrest

40:17.746 --> 40:19.747
for the murder of Daphne zimmer.

40:19.748 --> 40:22.920
(Handcuffs click) You have the
right to remain silent. Anything you say

40:22.921 --> 40:25.553
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

40:25.554 --> 40:27.755
You have the right to an
attorney. If you can't afford

40:27.756 --> 40:29.727
an attorney, an attorney
will be provided for you.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.198
Do you understand these rights?

40:31.199 --> 40:34.602
(Ingrid michaelson's
