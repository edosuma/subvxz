01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.050
A way out.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.081
This came from you, I take it.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.760
What is it?

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:53.300
It's new. Perforates the small bowel
over six hours or so,

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.140
causing irreversible haemorrhaging.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:58.322
Leaves no trace.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.725
How clever.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:08.660
You're madder than you look.
Shoot me or get out. I'm not taking that.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.411
I was afraid that would be your answer.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:14.980
That's why I've taken the decision
out of your hands.

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.163
It's not your pub lunch
that's making you queasy.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.566
I had the rib of beef, too.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.131
Tell me you're lying, Harry.

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.140
Please.

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:34.766
Tell me you didn't betray your country.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.220
It's been four hours already, Geraldine.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.300
You can spend the last two
in a hospital bed,

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:47.042
but if I were you, I'd go and play
with that beautiful niece of yours.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.500
<font color="#808080">PEARCE:</font> I hear Mace offered you a job.
Are you taking it?

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:44.409
<font color="#808080">HOLLOWAY:</font> Thinking about it.

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.680
Your message said
you had something to tell me.

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:56.082
They've put surveillance on Ruth's grave.
You can't go there any more.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:09.210
I have something which, by rights,
should be yours.

01:38:18.040 --> 01:38:20.771
Your father was wearing it
the night he died.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.620
The Stasi stripped his body
of everything that could be useful

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.247
and it found its way
into an FSB archive somewhere.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.540
He was wearing a wedding ring
on the night of his op?

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.620
Ordinarily, he wouldn't have.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:37.326
But he'd just found out
he was to have a son.

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:45.446
I didn't decommission you
because you weren't good enough.

01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.608
After your father, I couldn't...

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.003
I had to protect you.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:55.125
The good ones tend not to last, Will.

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.163
Then who does?

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.087
The ones like me.
