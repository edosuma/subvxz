WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:13.875
He could be
a pro ball
player.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.875
Ah, he wants to be a lawyer.

00:15.959 --> 00:18.583
(female #1)
'I'll bet he wants
to be a ballplayer.'

00:18.667 --> 00:19.917
'And if you're
gonna marry him?'

00:20.000 --> 00:21.583
It'll be
better
if he's a
lawyer.

00:21.667 --> 00:22.709
Why?

00:22.792 --> 00:24.083
Then he won't be
on the road.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.667
All those
baseball hussies?

00:26.750 --> 00:28.875
Who said anything
about getting married?

00:28.959 --> 00:30.750
It never crossed your mind?

00:30.834 --> 00:31.959
He keeps saying
he has something

00:32.041 --> 00:34.417
that he wants to
talk to me about.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.125
He sounds real nervous.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.000
He's such a little boy.

00:51.375 --> 00:54.041
Hey, baby.
How about a date?

01:30.125 --> 01:32.750
Hey, hey, college boy.

01:32.834 --> 01:34.250
Did you see,
uh, Callison choke

01:34.333 --> 01:35.875
in the ninth inning
last night?

01:35.959 --> 01:38.083
He didn't choke.
The ump robbed him.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.667
That last pitch
was low and inside.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.667
Tsk. These degenerates.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.709
You know, you're not
like the rest of 'em.

01:52.792 --> 01:54.166
Why? Because I play baseball?

01:54.250 --> 01:57.125
Are you sure you're a fag?

01:57.208 --> 01:59.291
Are you sure you're Italian?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.458
Hmm.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.208
- Gin?
- 'Yeah.'

02:15.750 --> 02:18.250
God Bless us nelly queens!

02:46.750 --> 02:48.083
This domestic call

02:48.166 --> 02:51.959
came in every Friday
night.
Same damn couple.

02:53.709 --> 02:55.000
We've finally shut 'em down

02:55.083 --> 02:57.542
with the blind policeman
routine.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.625
- Blind policeman?
- Yeah.

02:59.709 --> 03:02.458
We go to their door
with a white stick and glasses

03:02.542 --> 03:04.041
start taking down
their report.

03:04.125 --> 03:06.417
Tell 'em it's an equal
opportunity program.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.000
'Grope their faces,
they're so thrown off'

03:08.083 --> 03:10.875
they don't call for weeks.

03:10.959 --> 03:13.667
You ever do blind
policeman
in your patrol days?

03:13.750 --> 03:15.709
Gets 'em every time.

03:15.792 --> 03:19.625
The, um, the lady
from Milwaukee is here.

03:19.709 --> 03:21.959
She called twice yesterday
for directions.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.250
And she's
an hour
early.

03:25.959 --> 03:26.959
Mrs. Holtz?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.417
I know I'm early.
I can wait.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.792
No, no, it's fine.
I'm Detective Rush.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.959
This is Detective Valens.

03:33.041 --> 03:35.083
Is it true Milwaukee
smells like beer?

03:35.166 --> 03:38.125
I've lived there
too long to know.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.083
I haven't been here
for a while.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.625
What brings you now?

03:41.709 --> 03:44.959
My son was murdered
here in 1964.

03:45.041 --> 03:46.625
He was a student.

03:46.709 --> 03:49.458
- A robbery?
- They said it was at
first.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.917
And then
they said something else.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.041
What?

03:54.041 --> 03:56.792
They said he'd been
at a gay bar.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.834
My husband and I told them
that was wrong.

03:58.917 --> 04:01.208
That Danny had a girlfriend.

04:02.125 --> 04:04.875
The world has changed so much.

04:04.959 --> 04:09.291
- What was your son's name?
- Daniel Holtz.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.250
Please, have a seat.

04:14.792 --> 04:17.000
You didn't know
your son was gay?

04:17.083 --> 04:19.125
I didn't wanna know.

04:19.208 --> 04:22.667
And now, much too late
I realize..

04:22.750 --> 04:25.291
...that kept me
from really knowing him.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.875
Cops back then
talk about other leads?

04:27.959 --> 04:31.667
They mostly talked about my
husband and I being nice
people.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.959
I have a heart condition.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.166
Triple bypass.
I'm running on fumes.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.333
If there's one thing I want
to settle before I go..

04:42.083 --> 04:45.125
I think the police swept this
under the rug.

04:45.208 --> 04:48.542
And my husband and I
helped them do it.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.542
We didn't push.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.792
We'll pull his case.

05:27.834 --> 05:30.166
(Valens)
'I don't see a box.'

05:30.250 --> 05:31.583
(Rush)
<i>Z.'</i>

05:31.667 --> 05:34.875
(Valens)
'I know. There's no box.'

05:37.375 --> 05:39.208
Tough to live with, huh?

05:39.291 --> 05:42.083
She must have told the assigned
detective to lay off.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.208
A civilian tells you
to lay off, you do it?

05:44.291 --> 05:46.333
No, I go harder.

05:47.291 --> 05:48.750
They get jumbled up a lot?

05:48.834 --> 05:50.500
It's getting better.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.166
People are learning
the alphabet.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.417
Except Vera.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.000
Not every case
is a box job.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.291
If there isn't
enough
to fill a box...

05:57.375 --> 05:58.750
Here it is.

05:58.834 --> 06:01.458
Living in a group home.

06:01.542 --> 06:03.208
Hmm. Skimpy, huh?

06:03.291 --> 06:06.458
- Doesn't say high priority.
- No.

06:06.542 --> 06:09.250
Body was found in the
alley
behind a bar.

06:09.333 --> 06:12.291
Queen Village.
It's perfect.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.917
This case gonna make
you uneasy there,
Scotty?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.041
- No.
- Okay.

06:17.125 --> 06:20.208
'64? That's back when
patrol cars were red.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.125
Hmm. Random street murder.

06:22.208 --> 06:23.583
Assigned detectives
are both dead.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.291
Gay bashing outside a bar
that don't exist anymore.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.959
And you have three
civilian
interviews.

06:29.041 --> 06:32.291
- Sounds like a winner, huh?
- We got a shot.

06:32.375 --> 06:34.500
Joined the patron saints
of lost causes?

06:34.583 --> 06:36.417
Ain't lost
if I'm looking for it.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.625
Whoo! Got him to
drink the Kool-Aid.

06:39.625 --> 06:41.125
So where you two gonna start?

06:41.208 --> 06:43.959
- Crime scene.
- Queen Village.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.000
That cracks him up.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.750
Take Jeffries.
Maybe he remembers the bar.

06:47.834 --> 06:50.959
- Someone saw what happened.
- Someone always does, Lil.

06:51.041 --> 06:52.792
So we'll find 'em.
Knock on doors.

06:52.875 --> 06:56.417
Ask neighborhood people.
Someone will remember our guy.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.875
Another optimist.

07:24.583 --> 07:28.709
The Hush Room was over there.
Corner of Sodom and Gomorrah.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.417
(Rush)
'Is that what
the cops called it?'

07:32.500 --> 07:33.917
It's what the residents
called it.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.208
- Nice, huh?
- Now.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.875
- Neighborhood's changed.
- Night and day.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.083
All the neighbors are long gone.

07:39.166 --> 07:40.709
Yuppies pushed 'em out.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.208
If it was so crappy
how come this Penn
kid

07:42.291 --> 07:43.458
came all the way down here?

07:43.542 --> 07:44.542
If you were gay in '64

07:44.625 --> 07:46.166
this was the only game in town.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.959
If you want to socialize,
this was the only place.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.125
So why was Danny in this alley?

07:53.208 --> 07:56.125
Got chased.
Or ambushed.

07:56.208 --> 07:57.500
(Vera)
Or lucky.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.083
How would he have gotten
back to campus in '64?

08:00.166 --> 08:01.333
Subway.

08:01.417 --> 08:02.709
The other direction
from the Hush Room.

08:02.792 --> 08:05.291
Maybe he found a friend
who lived thataway?

08:08.625 --> 08:12.250
Caller saw the body, "Splayed
and protruding in the alley."

08:12.333 --> 08:14.417
- Who called it in?
- Anonymous.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.834
Boy, you got nada.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.291
We got a neighbor
who saw nothing

08:17.375 --> 08:18.542
a bartender
who knew nothing

08:18.625 --> 08:20.542
and a drag queen
called Tinkerbell.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.750
Plus a note tossed in
that Tinkerbell had a lead

08:22.834 --> 08:25.166
on who liked to kick queer ass
in the neighborhood.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.208
Let me guess.
No follow-up, right?

08:27.291 --> 08:29.250
Tinkerbell could have been
a good ID, though.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.166
Like a...gang moniker.

08:31.250 --> 08:34.000
That's how
we find the thugs now.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.709
You want to look for Tinkerbell?

08:35.792 --> 08:36.875
In Never Never Land?

08:36.959 --> 08:38.375
Or drag bars.

08:38.458 --> 08:40.583
You sure that's
the best job for
me?

08:41.792 --> 08:44.041
Ah. Definitely.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.834
We should check
the old arrest books

08:47.917 --> 08:49.250
at the District Station House.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.875
'Figure out who
the area bullies were.'

08:50.959 --> 08:52.542
I'll go to
the District House with
you.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.041
You troll the bars with me.

08:54.125 --> 08:56.458
Sure. I ain't scared.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.417
So what violations
are we looking for?

09:00.500 --> 09:02.375
There wasn't a code
for hate crimes.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.917
Certainly weren't
calling it gay bashing.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.125
So what?
Male-on-male assaults?

09:09.208 --> 09:12.667
Assault, drunk and
disorderly,
disturbing the peace..

09:12.750 --> 09:15.083
...the whole constellation.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.959
South Philly thugs.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.792
I probably got relatives
in this book.

09:21.875 --> 09:26.750
The Hush Room was managed by
Anthony DeSica from '61 to '68.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.166
Hmm. We'll go and see him.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.458
Our boss, Lieutenant Stillman.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.625
- Yes, I remember.
- Mrs. Holtz.

09:31.709 --> 09:34.875
Thank you for looking at this
case again so much time later.

09:34.959 --> 09:37.250
Well, no case is too old
to open again, ma'am.

09:38.709 --> 09:40.542
I never asked before.

09:40.625 --> 09:44.333
Does it say in there
how exactly Danny died?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.041
Blunt force trauma.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.166
Beaten?

09:49.250 --> 09:50.458
Um..

09:52.959 --> 09:55.792
Uh, "with a round,
wooden implement."

09:55.875 --> 09:58.417
Baseball bat, maybe.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.000
Oh, that would be too awful.

10:01.083 --> 10:04.000
There wasn't much Danny
loved more than
baseball.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.291
He was on the Penn team.

10:05.375 --> 10:07.041
He must have been
a decent player.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.709
Shortstop.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.458
In your original interview,
Helen

10:10.542 --> 10:12.417
you mention Danny's fiancee.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.208
Well, girlfriend.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.583
He said his
girlfriend,
at least.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.166
The fiancee part maybe
was my wishful
thinking.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.959
What about other friends?

10:22.041 --> 10:23.458
Danny had a lot of friends.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.583
Anyone that could have been
a romantic interest?

10:26.667 --> 10:29.375
Looking back?

10:29.458 --> 10:31.959
(male #1)
'You think he'll be there?
We are early.'

10:32.041 --> 10:33.291
I don't know,
but my feet are killing me.

10:33.375 --> 10:35.041
The Liberty Bell
isn't that fascinating.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.041
I hear him.
Danny, it's us.

10:38.125 --> 10:39.792
Honey, are you there?

10:39.875 --> 10:42.208
(Danny)
'Hey, mom.
Uh, just a second.'

10:50.125 --> 10:52.375
This is a friend
from the law school.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.417
We were just studying.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.792
Uh, I thought you guys
weren't coming back till
later.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.875
I'm late. I've gotta go.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.250
So nice to meet you.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.500
Did you guys
have a good time?

11:08.583 --> 11:10.208
We had a great time.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.583
Your mother loved it.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.542
What time
are we meeting Deborah?

11:17.375 --> 11:20.083
I don't even know
that boy's name.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.041
'I know so little
about his life.'

11:23.125 --> 11:25.750
- Would Deborah know?
- Maybe.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.000
Last I heard of her,
she was applying to med school.

11:28.083 --> 11:30.417
- You remember her last name?
- I could get it.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.166
She wrote us an awfully
nice note when Danny
died.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.917
If you find that boy..

11:37.000 --> 11:39.333
...or whoever
was important to
Danny

11:39.417 --> 11:41.250
'will you let him know
I'm here?'

11:41.333 --> 11:42.709
Sure.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.792
You, uh, still wanna go
to the scene, ma'am?

11:44.875 --> 11:47.458
I do.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.875
But I'm feeling too tired now.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.333
Maybe tomorrow.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.291
I'll walk you out.

12:02.709 --> 12:06.625
Hey. Queen Village,
bullies and thugs, circa
1964.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.208
- We extrapolated.
- Thanks.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.458
You boys have fun tonight.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.083
We wanna talk to you
about the Hush Room, Anthony.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.667
Why you asking
about ancient
history?

12:19.750 --> 12:21.917
That's the business we're in.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.875
Ralphie, finish this, huh?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.166
Everyone in the place
don't need to know

12:32.250 --> 12:33.792
I worked in a queer bar.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.750
- Yeah, okay.
- My uncle owned it.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.166
What can I say?
I wasn't his favorite nephew.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.166
'I got the booby prize job.'

12:40.250 --> 12:42.959
You remember this kid, Danny?

12:43.041 --> 12:45.959
Yeah. I liked him.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.000
He was a baseball nut.

12:48.083 --> 12:51.000
That was the year the Phillies
choked on the pennant race.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.250
'They were eight
and a half games ahead'

12:52.333 --> 12:55.542
and then they blew ten
straight in a row.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.583
So I had somethin'
to talk with him about.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.500
Any idea who killed him?

12:59.583 --> 13:01.375
Everybody hated those people.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.542
How about a drag queen
called Tinkerbell?

13:03.625 --> 13:05.125
You friendly with her?

13:05.208 --> 13:08.000
They were all Tinkerbells to me.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.333
You remember
the night Danny
died?

13:09.417 --> 13:12.166
Yeah, 'cause of the raid.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.917
What about it?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.375
Cops was raiding us
all the time.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.000
So we paid them off to tip us
as to when they were coming.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.583
What did you do
with the information?

13:22.667 --> 13:25.417
I had a red light
behind the bar.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.000
If people were dancing
and the red light started

13:28.083 --> 13:30.250
they knew to hurry up
and get into boy-girl couples

13:30.333 --> 13:32.000
before the cops got there.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.500
Only that night
there was no warning.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.709
- How come?
- I don't know.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.458
Maybe my uncle was late
with the payoff.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.709
[man shouting]
'Switch! Switch! Red alert!'

14:09.166 --> 14:12.166
- Cops ever do any damage?
- Sure.

14:12.250 --> 14:16.208
Those kind of raids
was open season on them fags.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.417
There's nothing on the books
about a police raid.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.709
You're surprised.

14:21.792 --> 14:23.500
This raid happened
the night of a murder.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.083
That's pretty significant.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.458
Yeah, well, things were
different back then, Scott.

14:28.542 --> 14:30.083
The department
isn't squeaky clean.

14:30.166 --> 14:32.083
There's a lot
that's ugly in our past.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.417
So now we got two secret worlds
to break into.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.625
Gays and the history
of the department.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.792
Do you know
about Russo's raiders?

14:41.875 --> 14:43.333
Heard stories.

14:56.208 --> 14:58.959
Captain John Russo
had an elite squad.

14:59.041 --> 15:01.125
They took care of business.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.834
Payoffs, raids.

15:02.917 --> 15:05.458
- Probably gay bashing, too.
- Nice.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.166
So how do we find out
what cops were on this raid?

15:08.250 --> 15:11.875
Not from the records, Lil.
That stuff was off the books.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.375
How do we find out
if Danny was beaten

15:13.458 --> 15:15.750
with a nightstick,
and not a bat?

15:22.959 --> 15:24.208
(Vera)
'We should stop callin'
them drag queens.'

15:24.291 --> 15:25.542
(Jeffries)
'How come?'

15:25.625 --> 15:27.500
I think the last guy
was offended.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.834
I always thought they call
themselves drag queens.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.875
- Don't mean we can.
- 'Is it a slur?'

15:32.959 --> 15:35.458
- I don't think it is.
- How about cross-dresser?

15:35.542 --> 15:38.250
- That's not offensive,
right?
- No, it's neutral.

15:38.333 --> 15:41.166
Alright, let's go
with that one this time.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.417
Hey, how's it going?

15:43.500 --> 15:44.667
Super.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.250
We're, uh, looking
for an older gentleman..

15:47.333 --> 15:50.041
...a cross-dresser who goes
by the name Tinkerbell.

15:50.125 --> 15:51.333
Don't know him.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.000
You got any old timers
that hang out here?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.667
There's an older crowd
in the rooms upstairs.

15:55.750 --> 15:58.083
- What rooms?
- The conversation rooms.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.458
Hell, we're not Vice.
We don't care about your rooms.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.417
- We're looking for a
witness.
- Go on up.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.375
Just watch your body language
if you don't want to get
groped.

16:13.625 --> 16:16.166
Danny's mom said
you two dated in college?

16:17.583 --> 16:21.917
Mmm. I found out
about Danny the hard way.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.083
I caught him and Hank kissing.

16:25.166 --> 16:28.750
Damn you. Damn you.

16:29.375 --> 16:32.041
I'm sorry.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.291
Everything's a big lie.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.333
You're just a liar using me?

16:36.417 --> 16:39.542
No. No.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.417
I love you.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.875
Nothing has to change.

16:43.959 --> 16:47.959
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I do love you.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.875
I love you.

16:49.959 --> 16:52.583
But not the way
you're supposed to.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.625
Tell me.

17:09.458 --> 17:11.208
Not as much.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.375
As much as what?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.583
As I love him.

17:27.625 --> 17:30.291
Did you kill him? I mean,
that would solve our case.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.417
No. We became friends.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.458
Oh, gotta run.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.291
Uh, can we walk with you?

17:37.375 --> 17:38.792
Do you know
how to deliver a baby?

17:38.875 --> 17:40.291
A man can learn anything.

17:43.458 --> 17:44.625
You know, I always wondered

17:44.709 --> 17:46.917
if it was
just a random street thing.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.917
'Something really bad
was happening in his life.'

17:50.000 --> 17:51.166
Like what?

17:51.250 --> 17:53.917
I think Danny
was being blackmailed.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.291
He needed a chunk of money.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.959
And obviously he hadn't gotten
a girl in trouble

17:58.041 --> 17:59.542
as we used to say.

17:59.625 --> 18:03.333
But then I think why would
anyone blackmail Danny?

18:03.417 --> 18:06.125
He didn't have a cent.
Borrowed toothpaste.

18:08.208 --> 18:09.834
Oop. Last warning.

18:09.917 --> 18:13.291
Um, did you know his boyfriend?

18:13.375 --> 18:15.291
Hank? Mmm.

18:15.375 --> 18:18.917
Ambitious,
master of the universe type.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.166
Law student.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.709
What's Hank's last name?

18:21.792 --> 18:24.000
Hank...uh..

18:24.083 --> 18:25.291
What's the screwdriver?

18:25.375 --> 18:27.041
- Phillips?
- Hank Phillips.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.333
I don't know
what became of him.

18:29.417 --> 18:32.000
Danny didn't deserve
what happened to him.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.083
And even though,
I'm the one who got

18:34.166 --> 18:36.792
her heart broken..

18:36.875 --> 18:39.333
...Danny wasn't cruel.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.208
The world was.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.375
The story is
Tinkerbell
had a nipple ring.

18:48.458 --> 18:50.709
Way ahead of his time with that.

18:50.792 --> 18:53.333
Anyway, in one of
his
many ass kickings

18:53.417 --> 18:57.375
a guy took a knife and tried
to slice that ring right off.

18:57.458 --> 18:58.750
But there's a happy ending.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.250
Tink got the nipple
reconstructed for
free

19:01.333 --> 19:03.458
at the VA hospital.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.542
A doc there wrote
it up as a combat
wound

19:05.625 --> 19:07.834
she got fighting in Korea.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.375
So Tinkerbell was in the army?

19:10.458 --> 19:14.875
You know this doc's name?
Or Tinkerbell's?

19:14.959 --> 19:17.458
That old queen
sure got beaten up a
lot.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.583
Someone at the VA
may know her real name.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.709
Thanks for your time.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.709
- Thanks for this.
- What do you got?

19:33.792 --> 19:36.542
A question I need answered.
Quietly.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.917
- The case is from 1964.
- Hmm-mm.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.250
We need to know
about a weapon.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.750
- Oh, no problem.
- Oh, this is Shelly.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.208
'She's gonna do
that research for us.'

19:44.291 --> 19:47.500
- On the QT?
- Mum's the word.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.792
Thanks.

19:51.875 --> 19:55.208
Vera should be finding
true love right about now.

19:56.959 --> 20:00.208
Back in '64, Tinkerbell
came forward
voluntarily.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.917
Wanted to talk
about
being assaulted.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.583
Tinkerbell's not a joke.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.583
So far she's
our most promising
lead.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.417
I got another one..

20:09.500 --> 20:12.125
...from the law school
alumni office.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.625
- 'You found Hank?'
- Oh, yeah.

20:13.709 --> 20:15.417
Still lives in Philly.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.208
Henry Phillips.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.166
That

20:21.250 --> 20:25.291
(Rush)
'Your Honor,
Detective Rush, Homicide.'

20:25.375 --> 20:27.166
I'm here on a personal matter.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.959
A personal matter of yours?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.709
Of yours.

20:31.792 --> 20:34.792
I've reopened
the Daniel Holtz case.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.458
You and he were
both at Penn in 1964.

20:37.542 --> 20:39.625
You remember him?

20:39.709 --> 20:41.250
He was murdered.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.834
I understand
you were close friends.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.834
I'm not sure
I can get into this.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.250
I have no interest in
prying
into your personal life.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.667
I'm just trying
to solve a
homicide.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.625
We're looking into the
theory
it was a hate crime.

20:59.709 --> 21:01.625
A gay bashing.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.667
Who brought that theory
to the table?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.291
His mother.

21:08.709 --> 21:11.917
I don't remember him
well enough to help you.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.375
Well, take my card

21:15.458 --> 21:19.041
in case something
jogs your memory.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.000
Like the fact that
you cared about
him.

21:21.083 --> 21:25.583
I don't talk publicly about..

21:25.667 --> 21:27.166
...these things.

21:29.166 --> 21:32.000
I understand.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.625
I'd like to help you.

21:35.709 --> 21:39.041
But-but I need assurances.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.375
Between
you and me.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.375
No notes.

21:46.458 --> 21:49.291
What do you want to know?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.083
- Was Danny being blackmailed?
- No.

21:52.166 --> 21:54.291
His friend Deborah said he
needed money all of a sudden.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.792
He wasn't being blackmailed.
I was.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.166
- By who?
- The management.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.208
- At a certain bar.
- The Hush Room.

22:00.291 --> 22:03.375
I went to that rat hole
with Danny twice.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.750
And almost
had my life ruined.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.792
They were running
an extortion scam out of
there.

22:07.875 --> 22:10.208
And a young law student
was a good target.

22:12.458 --> 22:16.458
You couldn't be a lawyer
if you were gay back then.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.000
Moral turpitude.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.709
So why was Danny
trying to get
money

22:19.792 --> 22:21.250
if you were the one blackmailed?

22:21.333 --> 22:23.417
He felt responsible.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.250
He was responsible.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.792
'I didn't mind being
behind closed doors'

22:27.875 --> 22:30.583
but Danny wanted to be out,
on a scene.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.291
That make you angry?

22:33.375 --> 22:34.750
You think I killed him?

22:34.834 --> 22:39.417
In a disgusting alley
as a career move?

22:39.500 --> 22:41.625
Not my best theory.

22:44.625 --> 22:46.875
You know who really hated Danny?

22:48.750 --> 22:51.667
His teammates
on the baseball team.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.166
Hey, these yours?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.291
I know this place.

23:05.375 --> 23:06.917
You do?

23:10.291 --> 23:12.083
Yeah.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.625
Do you go there?

23:13.709 --> 23:15.792
I may have, yeah.

23:17.208 --> 23:18.250
Hmm.

23:23.583 --> 23:24.625
Faggot.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.625
From that day on

23:38.709 --> 23:41.875
they made things
really bad for him.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.125
Beaned him on purpose.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.375
Wouldn't sit with him
on the bus.

23:44.458 --> 23:45.625
He ended up quitting.

23:45.709 --> 23:48.166
'But in those days,
there was no such thing'

23:48.250 --> 23:51.208
as a gay athlete.
Not at Penn or anywhere else.

23:55.250 --> 23:56.917
Thank you.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.667
'For talking to me.'

23:58.750 --> 24:00.709
I need it to stay confidential.

24:00.792 --> 24:05.333
There's one person I'd like
to tell about our
conversation.

24:05.417 --> 24:07.333
Danny's mom's
in town.

24:07.417 --> 24:09.500
She'd like to hear from you.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.375
(Rush)
I hear you're running
a dice game

24:14.458 --> 24:15.959
out of your warehouse, Anthony.

24:16.041 --> 24:17.166
Dice game, what?

24:17.250 --> 24:18.625
I heard bingo, dogfights.

24:18.709 --> 24:20.125
Oh, all kinds of things
to write you up on.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.500
Come on you guys,
what do you want with me?

24:22.583 --> 24:23.875
Tell us about
the extortion scam.

24:23.959 --> 24:25.542
Extortion?
Why would we do that?

24:25.625 --> 24:26.917
You tell us.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.125
We was printing money,
selling watered-down
drinks

24:29.208 --> 24:30.583
'to the queers,
and it'd be bad for
business.'

24:30.667 --> 24:31.875
Talk about bad for business.

24:31.959 --> 24:34.000
How much you charge
for the dice game?

24:34.083 --> 24:35.750
Ah, come on.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.291
Okay.

24:44.375 --> 24:46.875
My moron cousin hid a camera.

24:46.959 --> 24:48.375
Tried to hit up
a couple of guys

24:48.458 --> 24:49.834
looked like they
had
something to lose.

24:49.917 --> 24:51.542
My uncle almost ripped
his throat out

24:51.625 --> 24:54.000
when he found out
for the reasons I cited
above.

24:54.083 --> 24:57.625
- Bad for business.
- My uncle shut him down.

24:57.709 --> 25:00.417
End of story.

25:00.500 --> 25:05.709
Believe me, my cousin was way
too small time to plan a
murder.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.875
The raid that night,
I need a name.

25:07.959 --> 25:09.250
They taped over their name tags.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.458
You usually got warning.
Who gave it to you?

25:11.542 --> 25:13.000
Bagman for the district captain.

25:13.083 --> 25:14.583
The guy who picked up
the payoff envelopes?

25:14.667 --> 25:17.417
Contributions to the
Police Athletic Foundation.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.375
His name.

25:19.458 --> 25:21.041
He was a rookie.

25:23.333 --> 25:24.417
Nelson.

25:26.875 --> 25:30.000
Was Officer Nelson at the bar
the night Danny was killed?

25:30.083 --> 25:32.125
He was always there.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.500
That's very helpful, Anthony.

25:39.792 --> 25:41.250
No, this is not a put on.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.250
He went by the name Tinkerbell.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.834
A Korean war vet.

25:44.917 --> 25:47.583
His chest area got in
a little accident with a
knife.

25:47.667 --> 25:51.583
Forty three guys named
Nelson
on the job in the '60s.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.041
So we track 'em all down.

25:53.125 --> 25:56.000
Yeah, yeah. A cross-dresser,
had a nipple ring.

25:56.083 --> 25:58.125
- The Penn baseball team?
- Yeah.

25:58.208 --> 26:00.542
They were in Ithaca, New York.
The weekend of your murder.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.792
An away game.
The entire lineup.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.792
(Valens)
'You look that up?'

26:04.875 --> 26:07.500
I happen to have every
sports record known to man.

26:07.583 --> 26:08.792
Memorized.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.959
Twenty less guys you
got
to check out.

26:11.041 --> 26:12.917
We have so many other suspects,
it's sad.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.458
Blackmail ring, rogue
cops,
neighborhood thugs.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.834
No shortage of people
who had it in for a gay kid.

26:18.917 --> 26:22.500
I got the results
you asked for.

26:22.583 --> 26:23.667
He's okay.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.834
Oh, thanks.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.667
I called in a
favor
at the FBI lab.

26:27.750 --> 26:30.166
We used a pig's head to
simulate
the bruise and wound pattern

26:30.250 --> 26:31.500
for the weapon
and then compared that

26:31.583 --> 26:32.709
to the victim photographs.

26:32.792 --> 26:33.667
And?

26:33.750 --> 26:34.792
And that kid was not killed

26:34.875 --> 26:35.875
with a nightstick.

26:35.959 --> 26:37.458
Well, that's a relief.

26:37.542 --> 26:38.834
- Thanks.
- Thank the pig.

26:38.917 --> 26:41.291
Uh, what's your guess
about the weapon?

26:41.375 --> 26:44.125
My money's
on the classic baseball
bat.

26:44.208 --> 26:45.458
Thanks.

26:45.542 --> 26:49.250
I found Tinkerbell.
Real name George Polk.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.625
Mr. Polk?

26:58.083 --> 26:59.667
George Polk?

27:01.166 --> 27:03.500
Detective Rush,
Philadelphia Police.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.458
(George)
'Go away.'

27:07.792 --> 27:09.875
I'm here about the 1964 murder

27:09.959 --> 27:12.417
of Daniel Holtz
outside The Hush Room.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.709
You wanted to give a statement
to police.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.959
I'm here to take it.

27:25.709 --> 27:29.041
Took you a while
to get back to me.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.458
Yes, it did.

27:37.166 --> 27:38.500
Decided to get dressed up?

27:38.583 --> 27:40.709
Yes, I did.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.875
You know, in my day,
I was beaten up

27:42.959 --> 27:48.375
by every cop and fag basher
in South Philly.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.875
Cops beat you up
for no reason?

27:50.959 --> 27:54.875
The reason, young man, was
hatred and career advancement.

27:54.959 --> 27:57.625
Now, Captain Russo
loved his fag bashing.

27:57.709 --> 27:59.959
We can only speculate why.

28:01.542 --> 28:03.417
These are mug shots
from the early '60s.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.959
Arrests out
of the Third District.

28:06.041 --> 28:09.250
- Is there a magnifier?
- Yes.

28:09.333 --> 28:10.959
- Here.
- Thank you.

28:12.834 --> 28:14.250
Yeah, 'cause
these-these old eyes

28:14.333 --> 28:17.166
you know,
they need help.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.041
Can I ask you somethin'?

28:19.125 --> 28:21.291
Please.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.083
Why did you flaunt
the way you were

28:23.166 --> 28:25.709
if you knew people were gonna
attack you for it?

28:25.792 --> 28:27.583
You're a homicide detective?

28:27.667 --> 28:30.625
He's...new.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.417
With what you see people do

28:32.500 --> 28:35.291
you get upset
about how a man dresses

28:35.375 --> 28:37.625
and who he loves?

28:37.709 --> 28:39.625
I ain't upset,
I'm just wondering

28:39.709 --> 28:41.792
'if you're getting beaten up
because you dress like a woman'

28:41.875 --> 28:43.542
'and you don't wanna
get beat up'

28:43.625 --> 28:45.917
why not stop dressing
like a woman?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.291
'Cause I was never
a practical girl.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.875
Oh, he's one of them.

28:56.959 --> 28:58.291
- One of who?
- The local monster.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.291
I remember his eyebrows.
He was the ringleader.

29:00.375 --> 29:01.667
What do you remember him doing?

29:01.750 --> 29:04.667
I remember him hitting me
and kicking me.

29:04.750 --> 29:05.959
And throwing things.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.375
- You're sure about him?
- I'm sure.

29:07.458 --> 29:08.959
His mother would egg him on
from the window

29:09.041 --> 29:10.875
of their little slum.

29:10.959 --> 29:15.792
And his name...is Brien.

29:15.875 --> 29:17.250
(Valens)
'Timmy O'Brien.'

29:17.333 --> 29:20.083
Lived around the corner
from The Hush Room.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.667
Uh-huh.

29:21.750 --> 29:26.083
- Fourth floor window,
right.
- Apartment 419.

29:26.166 --> 29:28.625
(George)
'If the local thugs did
in that poor boy'

29:28.709 --> 29:31.917
this one...was a part of it.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.792
Thank you, Mr. Polk.

29:38.625 --> 29:41.750
[sighs]
That Danny was a good one.

29:41.834 --> 29:43.709
Lot of spunk.

29:43.792 --> 29:45.667
But heartbroken
because the Phillies

29:45.750 --> 29:47.375
did something with a pennant.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.834
They blew the pennant race
in '64.

29:49.917 --> 29:51.583
That was it.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.625
And the boy was thrown off
of the baseball team.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.834
And he was always trying
to organize a game at the bar.

29:58.917 --> 30:03.458
I was going
to be...a cheerleader.

30:05.709 --> 30:08.542
I get the vapors
just thinking about it.

30:08.625 --> 30:09.709
Whoa.

30:24.667 --> 30:26.208
You, uh, Timmy O'Brien?

30:26.291 --> 30:27.583
Yeah.

30:29.291 --> 30:31.000
What's it about?

30:31.083 --> 30:34.709
Just, uh, following up
a dog call from a long time
ago.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.291
- Alright.
- You recognize this
individual?

30:39.667 --> 30:40.542
Maybe.

30:40.625 --> 30:42.417
Ever get on her case?

30:42.500 --> 30:43.542
Her?

30:44.875 --> 30:46.583
Word is, you took care
of business

30:46.667 --> 30:48.125
with the local drag queens.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.083
I didn't ask them
to come to my neighborhood.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.041
Start parading around
on the streets.

30:52.125 --> 30:53.959
I hear you.

30:54.041 --> 30:56.000
But I never hurt nobody.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.875
I'm just carrying out
a duty here.

30:57.959 --> 31:02.375
So, uh, what did you do
to these fine citizens?

31:02.458 --> 31:03.667
Kid stuff.

31:03.750 --> 31:05.625
You know,
harassing them, like..

31:05.709 --> 31:07.000
...throwin' stuff.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.250
Bottles, sticks?

31:09.333 --> 31:11.417
Chinese takeout.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.667
How's that work?

31:12.750 --> 31:14.792
Well, when we had
some leftovers

31:14.875 --> 31:16.667
see a couple of fags
on our street

31:16.750 --> 31:17.959
we'd dump the food on them.

31:18.041 --> 31:21.041
What's that?
Assault with a deadly egg
roll?

31:22.291 --> 31:24.959
You ever see this kid?

31:26.709 --> 31:27.959
Nah.

31:28.834 --> 31:31.000
'Cause he was a local fag.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.500
I don't recognize him.

31:39.875 --> 31:40.792
Okay.

31:40.875 --> 31:43.417
I ain't proud
of all that stuff.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.333
I wouldn't want my kids
to know I did it.

31:46.417 --> 31:48.667
But it was just pranks.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.625
Have a good day.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.458
Your Honor.

32:01.667 --> 32:05.125
[sighs]
Thanks for letting me
know.

32:05.208 --> 32:06.625
I wanted to meet her.

32:06.709 --> 32:09.250
The hotel said
she was brought here last
night.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.291
Hmm. How's she doing?

32:12.375 --> 32:13.542
Have you gone in?

32:13.625 --> 32:16.500
[sighs]
No, I was nervous.

32:16.583 --> 32:20.041
A grown man and I'm scared
to meet his mom.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.208
So I'll go with you.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.417
Helen, this is Hank.

32:38.709 --> 32:41.750
You're the boy
who ran out of the room.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.542
I guess so.

32:46.625 --> 32:47.875
Hank.

32:50.250 --> 32:51.625
Any progress?

32:51.709 --> 32:54.083
We've got at least
one person of interest.

32:54.166 --> 32:55.041
Who's that?

32:55.125 --> 32:56.709
Local thug in the neighborhood.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.250
Told a story
about throwing Chinese
leftovers

32:59.333 --> 33:02.917
'at gay men
out on the street.'

33:03.000 --> 33:05.166
You talked to that man?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.291
Yeah.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.750
You wanted to
know about Danny.

33:10.834 --> 33:15.542
In many ways,
Danny was a man of his time.

33:15.625 --> 33:18.000
He lied about his life
to some people.

33:20.333 --> 33:22.542
To you.

33:22.625 --> 33:27.417
In other ways...Danny was
ahead of his time.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.792
How?

33:29.875 --> 33:32.792
He didn't hate himself.

33:32.875 --> 33:37.375
Somehow he knew
he had a right to exist.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.583
(Hank)
'You haven't told them,
have you?'

33:41.667 --> 33:45.250
My parents?
You crazy?

33:45.333 --> 33:46.875
No way, huh?

33:50.000 --> 33:52.583
If they even suspected
I was rooting for the
Phillies

33:52.667 --> 33:56.417
against the Braves,
I'd be dead to them.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.208
I could never
go home again.

33:59.291 --> 34:01.291
- Hey, guys.
- Ladies, how's it goin?

34:01.375 --> 34:04.667
We got you some Chinese food.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.667
We hear faggots
like Chinese food.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.083
- Hey.
- Forget it.

34:16.166 --> 34:19.250
No, I wanna see
their faces.

34:19.333 --> 34:20.333
'Officer.'

34:20.417 --> 34:22.709
- 'Come on, Danny.'
- 'Officer.'

34:34.166 --> 34:35.625
Danny was brave.

34:37.792 --> 34:39.250
I wasn't.

34:40.542 --> 34:43.959
What happened
after the Chinese food?

34:46.750 --> 34:49.166
I went home, uh..

34:49.250 --> 34:51.667
...Danny came over later
and we fought.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.000
He stormed out obviously,
went to The Hush Room

34:54.083 --> 34:57.333
and...and I never
saw him again.

34:58.959 --> 35:01.542
(Rush)
'Do you know the name
of the officer he spoke to?'

35:01.625 --> 35:04.375
I have the paperwork.

35:04.458 --> 35:08.625
Danny threw it at me that
night,
called me a coward.

35:08.709 --> 35:10.333
You kept it?

35:10.417 --> 35:14.041
Anything I had of his, I kept.

35:14.125 --> 35:16.083
You loved him.

35:18.542 --> 35:19.792
Yes.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.959
I'm glad.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.333
Officer Paul Nelson
took the report.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.667
Nelson, same name
Anthony gave us.

35:32.750 --> 35:35.041
In '64, he was a rookie
in the Third District.

35:35.125 --> 35:39.834
He worked under the command
of Captain John Russo.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.375
A Russo's raider.

35:41.458 --> 35:45.041
He booked the city when he
retired. Lives out in Alden.

35:45.125 --> 35:48.458
Works at the cop shop
at the Union Hall.

35:48.542 --> 35:50.875
Go pay him a visit.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.208
- Paul Nelson?
- Yes?

35:55.291 --> 35:58.166
- Lilly Rush, Homicide.
- Scotty Valens, same.

35:58.250 --> 35:59.417
What can I do for you?

35:59.500 --> 36:01.083
You took a
complaint
of harassment

36:01.166 --> 36:03.625
from a Daniel Holtz in 1964.

36:03.709 --> 36:06.417
Neighborhood boys
threw food at them.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.792
This kid was murdered
the same night.

36:12.834 --> 36:15.250
Yeah.

36:15.333 --> 36:17.417
Wanna to tell us
what you know?

36:19.000 --> 36:21.333
I knew this day would come.

36:24.291 --> 36:26.333
Let's meet tomorrow.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.834
That kid Danny had moxie..

36:33.917 --> 36:36.917
...coming to me with the
noodles
drippin' from his forehead.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.458
I asked him
if he was the shortstop

36:38.542 --> 36:42.667
on the Penn baseball team
'cause I recognized him.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.125
'I went to some
of them games.'

36:44.208 --> 36:46.917
You talked about
baseball
at a time like that?

36:47.000 --> 36:48.500
I was embarrassed.

36:48.583 --> 36:52.166
Embarrassed because he was a
fag
and you had to talk to him?

36:52.250 --> 36:56.041
I thought the whole situation
was embarrassing.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.458
(Valens)
'How old were you?'

36:58.542 --> 37:00.125
Twenty two.

37:00.208 --> 37:04.166
I just started on the job.
I thought I'm set.

37:04.250 --> 37:07.625
Next thing you know,
I'm John Russo's bagman.

37:07.709 --> 37:09.291
That didn't sit
right
with you?

37:09.375 --> 37:11.166
Oh, I loved it at first.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.208
It was like going behind
the curtain in the Wizard of
Oz.

37:14.291 --> 37:15.792
See how the whole thing works.

37:15.875 --> 37:17.792
And the night
of Danny's murder

37:17.875 --> 37:20.500
how'd it work then?

37:20.583 --> 37:23.583
I took the kid's report.
That's it.

37:23.667 --> 37:28.750
Then they called a raid
that night...late.

37:28.834 --> 37:31.458
And I saw him again.

37:31.542 --> 37:34.041
[man shouting]
'Switch! Switch! Red alert!'

37:37.250 --> 37:38.750
(officer #1)
Break it up, break it up.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.709
Next time I saw him,
he was dead.

38:08.792 --> 38:11.000
You know what, Nelson?

38:11.083 --> 38:13.291
That's the part
I'm not buying.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.542
I don't need
to be talking to you.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.125
But you
are.
Why?

38:20.208 --> 38:21.667
You feel guilty
about something?

38:21.750 --> 38:24.875
I'm telling you
what I know.

38:24.959 --> 38:27.709
Me and my partner
chased a patron to the alley.

38:27.792 --> 38:32.250
We saw the kid's body splayed
and protruding from the alley.

38:32.333 --> 38:36.000
Splayed and protruding.
That's what the caller
said.

38:37.959 --> 38:40.041
You made that anonymous call.

38:42.458 --> 38:43.500
Don't do this to me.

38:43.583 --> 38:47.208
Look, we're
all cops
here.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.709
It'll be handled right.

38:48.792 --> 38:52.041
A cop didn't do this.

38:52.125 --> 38:54.375
Forensics says it was a cop.

38:54.458 --> 38:55.875
Weapon was a nightstick.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.834
- That's wrong.
- It's what the lab says.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.250
Absolutely wrong.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.917
Which you know is true
because you were there.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.125
- You saw what happened.
- I didn't see..

39:04.542 --> 39:06.208
...all of it.

39:06.291 --> 39:07.709
You walked away?

39:07.792 --> 39:10.917
I didn't know he was going
to die.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.291
They were beating
on him, and...yeah..

39:17.375 --> 39:19.667
...we looked the other way.

39:22.208 --> 39:23.417
Who were they?

39:23.500 --> 39:24.625
Some guys I knew
in the neighborhood.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.041
Who?
Names.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.750
- I don't know.
not

39:28.834 --> 39:30.917
It's what you're here for.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.250
I want to show you something.

39:39.041 --> 39:43.250
That's my son
and his partner.

39:43.333 --> 39:46.125
He thinks his old man
is a good guy.

39:48.667 --> 39:50.750
Which one's your son?

39:55.667 --> 39:57.709
So do it for him.

39:58.500 --> 40:01.041
Be a good guy.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.375
Hey, here they are.

40:23.458 --> 40:25.166
Hi, Timmy.

40:25.250 --> 40:29.417
Paul Nelson.
Your brother John's friend.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.500
Yeah,
It's been, like, ten
years.

40:38.417 --> 40:40.542
Since your dad's wake.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.125
- What are you doing here?
- He's given you up, Timmy.

40:46.208 --> 40:50.959
You're going down for the
murder
of Daniel Holtz in 1964.

40:51.041 --> 40:52.166
- 'Paul.'
- Sorry.

40:52.250 --> 40:54.083
Paul, you can't.

40:54.166 --> 40:56.125
No, you, you gotta
tell 'em what
happened.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.834
You got to tell 'em
what you really saw.

40:57.917 --> 40:59.834
'It was self-defense.'

40:59.917 --> 41:03.375
Are you gonna lie
or are you gonna tell the
truth?

41:03.458 --> 41:05.792
I'm gonna tell
the truth, Timmy.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.041
Where'd you come from,
sweetheart?

41:15.125 --> 41:16.291
You better start running.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.959
- Turn around and run.
- Huh, queer.

41:18.041 --> 41:20.417
- Come over here.
- Faggot, run. Run, faggot.

41:20.500 --> 41:23.166
- Run, pansy boy.
- Come on, fag boy. Run.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.375
Keep running,
keep going.

41:25.458 --> 41:26.917
Here we go.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.625
- 'You better run.'
- 'You gonna run, pansy boy?'

41:30.709 --> 41:33.542
- 'Keep running.'
- 'What are you stopping
for?'

41:33.625 --> 41:35.333
What you gonna do, huh?

41:35.417 --> 41:37.667
- 'Yeah, queer.'
- 'Coward.'

41:42.417 --> 41:43.834
Come on!

41:44.750 --> 41:46.166
Come on!
