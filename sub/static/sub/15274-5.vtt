YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT

09:23.734 --> 09:25.694
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

09:25.686 --> 09:27.316
SO...WHAT'S UP?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.987
YOU SEE THESE?

09:29.990 --> 09:32.030
THOSE ARE
THE YEAR-END NUMBERS

09:32.032 --> 09:34.572
FOR MY COMPANY,
AND THEY'RE VERY COMPLEX.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.414
IT TOOK FIVE ACCOUNTANTS
TO GET THEM THIS FAR.

09:38.408 --> 09:41.658
WE HAD SIX, BUT ONE OF THEM
HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

09:41.662 --> 09:44.002
POOR MURRAY.

09:44.004 --> 09:46.014
SO, WHAT'S THIS GOT
TO DO WITH ME?

09:46.006 --> 09:47.966
WELL, THERE ARE
DISCREPANCIES,

09:47.968 --> 09:49.878
AND WITH YOUR "A"
IN ALGEBRA,

09:49.880 --> 09:52.630
I FIGURED YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE I CAN TRUST NOW.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.093
I MEAN, YOU'RE FAMILY,

09:54.094 --> 09:58.104
SO I KNOW
YOU WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

10:00.681 --> 10:02.811
DAD, I'M NOT
A TRAINED ACCOUNTANT.

10:02.813 --> 10:04.143
DO YOU HEAR THIS GUY?

10:04.144 --> 10:06.944
JUNIOR, I REALLY ADMIRE
YOUR HUMILITY.

10:06.937 --> 10:08.437
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

10:08.438 --> 10:11.188
ALL RIGHT, STOP
THE HORSING AROUND.

10:11.191 --> 10:14.111
HOW LONG IS IT GOING
TO TAKE YOU TO FIX THIS,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.084
10, 15 MINUTES?

10:16.076 --> 10:18.866
DAD, THIS STUFF COULD
TAKE HOURS.

10:18.869 --> 10:23.999
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL PLAY ALONG.

10:24.004 --> 10:25.384
I DON'T NEED THEM

10:25.375 --> 10:28.545
UNTIL 7:00 A.M.
TOMORROW MORNING.

10:28.548 --> 10:32.248
SURE, DAD. I'LL GET STARTED
ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.722
OKAY, AND, HEY,
COULD YOU DO IT

10:34.715 --> 10:36.305
IN TRIPLICATE FOR ME?

10:36.306 --> 10:40.596
YOU WANT FOUR COPIES?

10:53.113 --> 10:54.153
GOOD MORNING.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.784
BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT,
ISN'T IT?

10:55.776 --> 11:00.036
YES, IT IS. AND SO,
WHERE ARE THE REPORTS?

11:00.040 --> 11:01.410
DONE AND DONE.

11:01.411 --> 11:06.421
YOU WERE RIGHT, THOUGH --
THERE WERE SOME DISCREPANCIES.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.416
SEE, CHECK THE AMORTIZATION
ON ITEM 14.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.708
ALMOST MISSED IT.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.001
PROBABLY WHAT SENT MURRAY
OVER THE EDGE.

11:17.347 --> 11:20.387
WELL, I'M RUNNING
A TAD LATE FOR SCHOOL.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.720
LOVE YOU BOTH. CIAO.

11:25.015 --> 11:28.975
OH, MY GOD, HE DID IT?
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.609
I'LL TELL YOU
HOW IT'S POSSIBLE --

11:30.610 --> 11:32.310
LAST NIGHT,
WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING,

11:32.312 --> 11:34.442
HE SNUCK OUT AND FOUND
A 24-HOUR ACCOUNTANT.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.204
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE SAW AN ACCOUNTANT?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.737
THEY'RE NOTARIZED.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.780
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
HE'S LYING ON TOP OF LIES.

11:43.784 --> 11:45.424
I SAY WE CALL HIM
ON IT TODAY.

11:45.415 --> 11:47.035
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
LISTEN.

11:47.037 --> 11:49.247
SURE, WE COULD GO YELL
AT HIM, WE COULD GROUND HIM,

11:49.249 --> 11:51.879
WE COULD ACTUALLY BEAT HIM
WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE.

11:51.882 --> 11:54.212
THAT WOULD BE
OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT AS PARENTS.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.304
BUT WHAT'S JUNIOR GOING
TO LEARN FROM THAT?

11:56.296 --> 11:57.296
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

11:57.297 --> 11:59.297
HE'LL LEARN
HOW TO SIT STANDING UP.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.549
AND SECONDLY,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

12:01.551 --> 12:02.891
HE'LL LEARN ALGEBRA.

12:02.893 --> 12:05.063
NO, IT'S THE LYING
I'M CONCERNED WITH.

12:05.055 --> 12:07.055
SEE, IT STARTS OFF
WITH ALGEBRA,

12:07.057 --> 12:09.647
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW
HE'S GOING...

12:09.649 --> 12:11.479
[ Imitating Bill Clinton ]
"I DID NOT HAVE

12:11.481 --> 12:15.781
SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH THAT WOMAN."

12:18.568 --> 12:19.908
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:19.910 --> 12:22.030
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
ONE MORE SHOT,

12:22.032 --> 12:23.862
BUT THEN HIS BUTT
IS MINE.

12:23.864 --> 12:26.374
OKAY.

12:29.079 --> 12:33.209
OKAY, SO, ARE YOU READY
FOR THE MOVIE?

12:33.213 --> 12:35.473

SO, WHAT DID YOU RENT?

12:55.235 --> 12:58.445
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE THIS.
IT'S CALLED "LIAR, LIAR."

12:58.448 --> 13:00.528
DIDN'T WE ALREADY SEE THAT?

13:00.530 --> 13:03.400
YEAH, BUT I FIGURED
WE'D WATCH IT AGAIN.

13:03.403 --> 13:04.913
I GUESS AFTER TONIGHT

13:04.905 --> 13:07.535
WE'LL HAVE SEEN
"LIAR, LIAR," "LIAR, LIAR."

13:07.537 --> 13:10.327
"LIAR, LIAR," IT IS.

13:10.330 --> 13:13.080
OH, LOOK
AT ALL THOSE STAIRS.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.633
JUNIOR,
WILL YOU CARRY ME UP?

13:15.625 --> 13:17.505

13:17.507 --> 13:19.507
WELL, I'M SO TIRED,
AND THERE'S 1, 2...

13:19.509 --> 13:22.339
I CAN'T EVEN COUNT
HOW MANY STAIRS.

13:22.342 --> 13:24.132

13:30.100 --> 13:31.480
AW, ISN'T THAT SWEET?

13:31.481 --> 13:33.311
NO, THAT IS NOT SWEET.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.823
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS AND TEACHING
THAT GIRL A LESSON RIGHT NOW.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.436
WHILE YOU'RE BUSY
PLAYING WITH JUNIOR,

13:38.438 --> 13:40.438
I'M GOING TO GET

13:40.440 --> 13:43.900
GOOD LUCK. SO COME HERE,

14:06.596 --> 14:08.386
WAIT, WHOA,
HO-HOLD UP, NOW.

14:08.388 --> 14:11.768
COME ON, NOW YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH JUNIOR

14:11.771 --> 14:13.891

14:13.894 --> 14:16.034
WELL, IT WAS MORE --

14:16.026 --> 14:18.526
PLEASE. HE GAVE YOU
HIS JACKET, DID YOUR CHORES,

SO STOP TRYING TO DENY IT.
IT'S INSULTING.

14:28.038 --> 14:29.288
OKAY, OKAY.

14:29.289 --> 14:30.749
I PROMISED HIM
I'D BE QUIET.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.450
FINE, AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BREAK A PROMISE,

14:33.453 --> 14:35.463
BUT THAT STILL LEAVES US.

14:35.455 --> 14:37.125
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.167
WELL, I COULD TELL
YOUR FATHER,

14:39.169 --> 14:40.839
AND YOU CAN GET PUNISHED,

14:40.840 --> 14:43.380

TO CRACK THE MYSTERY

16:20.150 --> 16:21.230
KNOWN AS ALGEBRA?

16:21.231 --> 16:22.271
IS THAT RIGHT?

16:22.272 --> 16:24.062
WOW, THAT OUGHT TO TRANSLATE

16:24.064 --> 16:25.914
TO AN INCREASE
IN MY ALLOWANCE.

16:25.905 --> 16:29.315
YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.
LET'S GIVE YOU A RAISE.

16:29.319 --> 16:30.529
SIT DOWN.

16:30.530 --> 16:33.370
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING NOW,
$10 A WEEK?

16:33.373 --> 16:35.383
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE SQUARE ROOT

16:35.375 --> 16:38.075
OF YOUR $10, AND MULTIPLY
THAT BY, LET'S SAY,

16:38.078 --> 16:40.288
14.5 PERCENT,
WHICH YOU KNOW

16:40.290 --> 16:41.580
IS GOING TO GIVE YOU "X,"

16:41.581 --> 16:45.761
AND THEN I WANT YOU
TO DIVIDE THAT BY PI.

16:45.755 --> 16:50.215
NOW, WHAT WOULD THAT BE,

16:50.220 --> 16:53.760
THAT WOULD BE...

WAS FULL OF NUMBERS?

18:54.424 --> 18:56.524
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
HAVING TWINS.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.968
