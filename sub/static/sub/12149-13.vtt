00:13.929 --> 00:14.980
Hi, Laura.  Diego.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.480
- Let the consumption begin.
- Excellent.

00:18.129 --> 00:20.899
- You gonna behave yourself?
- Ever seen me at a party?

00:25.929 --> 00:28.739
- Hi, you having fun?
- Sure.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.719
- This is--
- Your idea of hell.

00:31.329 --> 00:33.820
In hell you tend to know
a lot of the people.

00:34.329 --> 00:36.500
- I'm having a great time.
- Yeah?

00:37.329 --> 00:39.859
- Can I get you some blood?
- I'm good.

00:40.329 --> 00:42.429
Steve Paymer came.
Can you believe it?

00:43.929 --> 00:45.719
David Paymer's brother? Steve?

00:47.530 --> 00:48.789
Steve!

01:00.130 --> 01:01.250
Sorry.  Pardon me.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.790
I need to cool off.
Cordelia sure knows how to throw a do.

01:10.930 --> 01:14.439
These mini-Reubens, with the
little sauerkraut and little Swiss...

01:15.730 --> 01:17.829
...what genius brought these
into the world?

01:22.930 --> 01:26.370
What say a couple of demon hunters
start chatting up the fillies?

01:29.530 --> 01:31.349
- Hey.
- Hey--

01:31.329 --> 01:33.930
- Nice sweater.  Hand-knit?
- Certainly not by me.

01:34.930 --> 01:39.140
- I meant, it's a great sweater.
- Oh, well, I'll pass that on then.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.909
To the person who knit it.
I mean, I would if I knew who did.

01:45.129 --> 01:46.250
But I don't.

01:46.930 --> 01:48.959
So I won't pass it on to anyone,
will I?

01:49.930 --> 01:50.840
Bye.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.319
Diego, pants on!

02:01.329 --> 02:04.769
With my master's degree in fine arts,
I launched my own business...

02:05.530 --> 02:08.060
...selling sandwiches downtown
from a little cart.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.189
I do see a lot of stuff on the job.

02:13.930 --> 02:16.280
So I tell myself that I'm
"honing my eye."

02:18.129 --> 02:19.250
Makes sense.

02:25.330 --> 02:26.939
Oh, I love this!

02:32.530 --> 02:34.560
Would you like to dance?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.590
I don't dance.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.659
Hi, Dennis.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.689
How you doing?

03:29.530 --> 03:31.039
Still dead?

03:38.530 --> 03:39.930
I know the feeling.

04:44.529 --> 04:46.209
Holy God!

05:39.250 --> 05:40.259
Hey.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.300
Good morning.  Is there coffee?

05:43.449 --> 05:46.540
They're still in bean form.
I thought I ordered the ground.

05:47.649 --> 05:50.139
Can you crush them
with your vampire strength?

05:50.649 --> 05:52.970
Just mush the bag. Just...

05:53.649 --> 05:54.660
...mush them.

06:01.449 --> 06:04.750
- Really fun party last night.
- I'm so glad you came.

06:05.050 --> 06:08.000
I worried someone might suck
the energy out of the room...

06:08.649 --> 06:12.970
...like a hole of boring despair.
But there you were, in the clinch.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.259
I didn't--  Boring?

06:16.449 --> 06:19.750
You used to be a person.
Did people not party in olden times?

06:20.649 --> 06:22.050
I talked to people.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.980
- Laura.
- She thought you hated her.

06:25.449 --> 06:27.839
- I said you were challenged.
- I don't hate her.

06:28.449 --> 06:31.930
I got two modes with people,
bite and avoid.  Hard to shift.

06:32.649 --> 06:35.350
- I can't get too close.  With women--
- You can be nice.

06:35.649 --> 06:39.480
It's not like Laura's gonna throw
you down and tear off all of your--

06:40.449 --> 06:42.800
- Well, actually, Laura--
- I'll try harder.

06:43.449 --> 06:46.430
Still, I mean, the quiet,
reserved thing...

06:47.050 --> 06:48.839
...don't you think it makes me cool?

06:50.649 --> 06:53.069
- He was cooler.
- Good morning.

06:54.850 --> 06:57.129
- Now I'm depressed.
- I feel rather chipper.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.689
- That was quite the soiree.
- Glad someone enjoyed it.

07:01.449 --> 07:03.480
- I enjoyed it.
- A gala event.

07:03.850 --> 07:06.519
In particular, the tiny Reubens
and the shrimp puffs.

07:07.449 --> 07:10.500
Any leftovers lying about?
Any abandoned...

07:11.050 --> 07:12.100
...shrimp puffs?

07:14.050 --> 07:18.019
- You're broke, aren't you?
- A man's finances are his business.

07:18.850 --> 07:20.389
- Want a job?
- Oh, yes, please.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.720
I don't have much, but if you help...

07:23.050 --> 07:24.449
...you're entitled to a cut.

07:26.649 --> 07:29.350
- I don't know what to say.
- Great!  Now we're--

07:30.250 --> 07:31.759
Do I have to take a pay cut?

07:32.050 --> 07:33.060
A team!

07:37.449 --> 07:38.990
You won't be disappointed.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.649
There's something in my eye.

07:45.250 --> 07:47.990
Oh, don't go getting all sappy.
Hold me.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.689
- Why don't we just--?
- Hold me!

07:50.649 --> 07:52.019
- Hold on!
- Cordelia!

08:00.250 --> 08:01.300
Gross!  Oh!

08:02.050 --> 08:03.839
Ew, is all.

08:03.850 --> 08:07.750
- What did you see?
- I don't just see.  I feel, okay?

08:08.649 --> 08:10.680
- Thank you, Doyle.
- Is someone in trouble?

08:11.050 --> 08:12.029
I'm, uh....

08:12.850 --> 08:16.149
- I'm at the ready.
- You're going to the ice factory...

08:16.449 --> 08:18.199
- ...on 5th.
- What are we looking for?

08:18.850 --> 08:20.290
A corpse.

08:23.050 --> 08:25.720
- No access through the tunnels.
- I'm driving then.

08:26.050 --> 08:29.069
I'm coming with you.  I intend
to earn my keep.  By the way--

08:29.649 --> 08:31.509
- There's no dental.
- Right, I'll floss.

08:32.049 --> 08:32.779
Let's go.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.509
Hey, be careful.

08:35.049 --> 08:38.308
Guy was burned to death.  Thing that
did that could still be there.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.019
Did you see it?

08:41.049 --> 08:44.029
All I felt was his fear
and the exploding eyeballs.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.529
- Did I mention I hate this gig?
- We'll be in touch.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.009
After you, sir.

09:11.730 --> 09:14.190
Here we are. Jerico Ice Factory.

09:15.929 --> 09:17.789
- Boss, why don't I...
- Stay put.

09:18.330 --> 09:19.840
...stay here and wait for you?

10:52.529 --> 10:54.279
Captain Inferno, I presume.

10:56.129 --> 10:58.549
Close enough.  I don't do well
near an open flame.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.399
Only, you didn't burn him, did you?

11:06.330 --> 11:07.559
Who are you?

11:09.330 --> 11:11.860
I'm not a talker.
I let others carry the conversation.

11:12.330 --> 11:15.070
I am good at putting these
through heads, though.

11:17.730 --> 11:19.690
I am called Tay.

11:20.129 --> 11:22.269
- I'm not from your dimension.
- I bet.

11:23.129 --> 11:25.730
I was sent to stop it.
That is my cause here.

11:26.129 --> 11:29.039
- Stop what?
- The Bringer of Chaos.

11:30.929 --> 11:34.230
- What is it? Demon?
- More than a mere demon.

11:34.529 --> 11:37.159
It is a vessel of pure rage.

11:38.129 --> 11:41.889
It's almost destroyed my world,
and now it is loose in yours.

11:47.129 --> 11:49.480
- How can I kill it?
- You won't be able to.

11:50.129 --> 11:52.059
It's stronger than one man.

11:54.330 --> 11:58.120
If you and your people wish to live,
stay away.

12:06.090 --> 12:08.049
His name was Tay.
Seemed pretty shook up.

12:08.490 --> 12:11.299
Said it brings chaos
and destruction to his world.

12:12.090 --> 12:15.039
"Tay."  Could be a Kovitch demon
from the Caucuses.

12:15.690 --> 12:17.159
He's not from our dimension.

12:17.490 --> 12:20.019
- They must come to ours via portals.
- Portals?

12:20.490 --> 12:23.230
There are portals now?
When did they put in portals?

12:24.090 --> 12:27.350
Don't we have enough to do
without burning monsters coming here?

12:27.690 --> 12:31.340
We'll figure out what it is, boss.
You can count on it.

12:33.090 --> 12:36.600
Stop kissing butt.
It's not like we get overtime.

12:39.090 --> 12:41.049
- I'm on it.
- I also want to know--

12:41.490 --> 12:43.029
About similar killings lately?

12:44.490 --> 12:45.539
See? On it.

12:48.090 --> 12:50.789
- Where you headed?
- Victim's office.  He's in security.

12:51.690 --> 12:53.720
- I'd like to know who hired him.
- Okay.

15:24.769 --> 15:27.610
- What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

15:30.769 --> 15:33.610
Working for them?
How much do they pay you to hunt us?

15:34.370 --> 15:37.490
I work for myself.  I'm looking
for his killer.  Hard to forget.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.169
Burned alive.  Know anyone
who does that?

15:53.570 --> 15:54.549
Yes?

15:55.370 --> 15:57.789
Where? How soon?

16:49.370 --> 16:53.019
We're sorry, your call did
not go through, Please dial again,

17:21.769 --> 17:24.089
Angel Investigations,
we help the hopeless.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.098
I hate this phone.
Any luck?

17:26.569 --> 17:28.740
We're stymied on the demon
but we found...

17:28.970 --> 17:30.970
...four recent similar killings.

17:31.369 --> 17:33.509
All guys, all burned
from the inside out.

17:34.369 --> 17:35.559
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

17:35.569 --> 17:37.529
- It's a "she."
- A chick that burns?

17:38.569 --> 17:39.410
Are you okay?

17:39.769 --> 17:42.019
- Did she...?
- Care about me?

17:42.769 --> 17:43.779
Did she Carrie you?

17:43.970 --> 17:45.130
Carrie, the movie?

17:45.769 --> 17:47.000
I can't hear you.  Hello?

17:48.769 --> 17:49.890
Must be in a canyon.

17:49.970 --> 17:51.930
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you now.

17:52.369 --> 17:55.559
- Are you back?
- A bored warlock must have made these.

17:56.569 --> 17:58.460
Keep trying to find that demon ray,

17:58.970 --> 18:01.460
There's more to this.
I think he's on a mission.

18:01.970 --> 18:02.950
He may be the key,

18:03.170 --> 18:07.309
- What does she look like?
- Two ridges running down either cheek.

18:08.569 --> 18:11.170
Violet eyes,  She seemed intelligent,

18:11.569 --> 18:15.049
She was very...attractive,
for a demon.

18:15.769 --> 18:19.210
A hottie, huh?  I guess she is,
all right.  What with the sizzle.

18:19.970 --> 18:21.089
Sizzler?

18:21.769 --> 18:22.640
The sizzle factor.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.450
- Angel?
- I can't hear you.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.569
- Angel?
- Cordelia--

19:10.410 --> 19:12.660
- Excuse me, sir.  I need your help.
- What?

19:13.410 --> 19:17.099
- There's a man who wants to hurt me.
- What man? Where is he?

19:17.609 --> 19:19.430
Over there in the black coat.

19:22.410 --> 19:24.549
- Code three in the front gallery.
- Roger,

19:32.009 --> 19:33.450
Code three.

19:34.410 --> 19:35.990
Said he had a black jacket.

19:43.410 --> 19:44.640
Excuse me, ma'am.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.740
And this brings us to
Manet's incomparable...

19:48.210 --> 19:52.039
...la Musique aux Tuileries,
First exhibited in 1863.

20:24.809 --> 20:27.859
On the left, one spies
the painter himself.

20:28.410 --> 20:32.549
In the distance is Manet's friend,
French poet and critic Baudelaire.

20:33.809 --> 20:36.690
Interesting fellow.
In his poem, "Le Vampire," he wrote:

20:38.609 --> 20:43.180
Thou who abruptly as a knife
Didst come into my heart

20:44.009 --> 20:48.579
He strongly believed that evil forces
surrounded mankind...

20:49.410 --> 20:53.059
...and some speculate that the poem
was about a real vampire.

20:57.809 --> 21:01.880
Baudelaire was actually taller
and drunker than he's depicted here.

21:04.890 --> 21:05.829
Aha!

21:07.890 --> 21:09.569
Better be an "Aha!" of triumph.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.940
I was dreaming there was a sale
at Neiman's.

21:12.690 --> 21:15.710
I think I've located them,
the "Vigories of Oden Tal."

21:16.289 --> 21:18.150
- The what?
- Oden Tal.  Vigories.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.920
"They have four ridges on their
foreheads, are fierce warriors...

21:22.890 --> 21:25.799
- ...and the women live enslaved."
- Way to go, Wes!

21:25.890 --> 21:29.819
Angel said Tay was the key.
Any way to find him here in town?

21:30.690 --> 21:34.799
"The men are herbivores.
They eat stew made of rotten plants...

21:36.089 --> 21:38.299
...and must consume
half their body weight a day."

21:38.490 --> 21:39.359
Whoa.

21:39.690 --> 21:43.450
So, we're looking for the
biggest compost heap in L.A.?

21:48.690 --> 21:50.549
You. How?

21:51.089 --> 21:54.210
- A human would have been unconscious.
- Answer my questions first.

21:55.289 --> 21:58.309
- You're a vampire.
- Among other things.

21:58.890 --> 22:00.710
- What's Tay want?
- I don't have time.

22:01.289 --> 22:04.700
- Who killed the guy at the factory?
- You don't think I'll hurt you?

22:05.490 --> 22:08.470
Gotta risk it.  I can't allow
tourists to go torching locals.

22:09.089 --> 22:11.480
- Leave.  I'm warning you!
- What's gonna happen?

22:35.490 --> 22:36.569
Stay back!

22:37.890 --> 22:38.730
We must go.

22:43.289 --> 22:45.250
- What's wrong?
- It's not your concern.

22:45.690 --> 22:48.880
- You're not one of us.
- No, but I'll stick around anyway.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.559
It's right, this is not your concern.

22:52.890 --> 22:55.059
The traitor, it, and the other
are ours.

22:55.890 --> 22:57.500
- It's best not to--
- Do that?

23:18.089 --> 23:21.529
- What will happen to her?
- She will be unmade.

23:27.089 --> 23:29.720
Please, please!  You don't
have to do this to me!

23:30.690 --> 23:32.160
Watch its hands.

23:34.890 --> 23:38.259
I'll be good, I promise.
You don't have to do this to me.

23:39.089 --> 23:41.690
Why does it speak when no one listens?

23:44.490 --> 23:46.210
Please!

23:50.490 --> 23:52.880
- It has been recovered.
- Let me go!

23:55.890 --> 23:59.259
- It will now be restored.
- You bastards!

24:04.289 --> 24:06.569
You'll feel so much better after this.

24:11.490 --> 24:12.890
No!

24:37.690 --> 24:39.369
You should dress that.

24:40.089 --> 24:41.390
Your wound.

24:44.289 --> 24:46.750
Why do this?
I thought vampires were killers.

24:47.289 --> 24:49.359
They are.  I was cursed by gypsies.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.460
- Cursed to help people?
- Yeah.

24:53.289 --> 24:56.029
Gypsies have a strange
sense of...humor.

25:13.089 --> 25:14.950
Want to tell me what's going on?

25:18.490 --> 25:22.809
The girl is a runaway.  I was trying
to help her escape from our homeland.

25:24.490 --> 25:25.220
If you hadn't--

25:25.690 --> 25:28.109
If I hadn't helped,
you'd both be with them now.

25:29.289 --> 25:30.160
Perhaps.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.450
Why was the girl running away?

25:36.490 --> 25:38.809
- She was going to be unmade.
- They'd kill her?

25:38.890 --> 25:41.140
In a fashion you wouldn't understand.

25:44.890 --> 25:45.940
Try me.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.460
In Oden Tal...

25:51.490 --> 25:54.859
...what you call personality,
our passions...

25:56.289 --> 26:00.789
...these impulses sit in an area
of the body we call the Ko.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.180
Your pursuers want to
take this from you?

26:18.490 --> 26:19.750
From the women, yes.

26:20.289 --> 26:24.859
Once females come of age, Ko controls
our physical and sexual power.

26:25.690 --> 26:30.259
It even signals when we're aroused
and have met desirable mates.

26:31.690 --> 26:34.009
- When it's removed--
- You're easily controlled.

26:39.490 --> 26:43.809
We marry who they command
and serve without questioning.

26:46.089 --> 26:49.210
- We leave behind dreaming.
- But you escaped.

26:50.289 --> 26:53.549
I was the first.  I am Jhiera.

26:56.890 --> 26:58.779
Jhiera of Oden Tal.

27:00.490 --> 27:02.490
My family rules the dimension.

27:02.890 --> 27:04.329
I bet they're not loving...

27:05.289 --> 27:08.380
...your portal jumping,
refugee-aiding duties.

27:12.490 --> 27:15.329
They tell the people I'm dead,
but the women know.

27:18.490 --> 27:22.390
Here, we have a name, a chance
to become.  But it's difficult.

27:23.289 --> 27:26.799
When the Ko first matures,
the girls can't manage it...

27:27.490 --> 27:29.029
...our physical energy.

27:30.490 --> 27:33.509
We come to your world in a fever.

27:34.690 --> 27:37.150
That's why...the ice.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.769
Yes.

27:40.089 --> 27:43.069
When I first arrived, alone...

27:43.690 --> 27:46.990
...I thought I would die
from the heat under my skin.

27:53.289 --> 27:54.549
And your people...

27:56.289 --> 27:57.549
...the men.

27:59.289 --> 28:01.180
Some respond to the Ko involuntarily.

28:01.690 --> 28:03.900
They try to force themselves.
It wasn't safe.

28:04.690 --> 28:06.940
Until I found the frozen water.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.099
As long as I could stay cool...

28:14.890 --> 28:17.450
...the worst of it passed
in a few months' time.

28:19.690 --> 28:21.859
Then I started to learn
to control my power.

28:22.690 --> 28:24.579
Like last night when you burned me.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.309
I wanted to hurt you.
I thought you were my enemy.

28:30.490 --> 28:34.000
- Who burned the guard?
- He tried to touch one of my girls.

28:34.690 --> 28:38.019
- He probably didn't mean to hurt her.
- She couldn't help killing him.

28:38.890 --> 28:42.509
What about the other four guys who
died the same way in the last year?

28:43.089 --> 28:45.690
- Have you been--?
- No, I haven't been following you.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.650
If you burn people,
there'll be questions.

28:49.089 --> 28:51.650
I understand what you're doing,
and I'll help...

28:52.690 --> 28:54.509
...but you can't hurt men
in my world.

28:55.089 --> 28:56.880
I am daughter to a king, sir.

28:56.890 --> 28:59.279
The king who promised
a better life for everyone.

29:00.490 --> 29:03.259
I didn't denounce him and escape
for my good alone.

29:04.089 --> 29:07.210
I did it to fulfill his promise
for all the women of Oden Tal.

29:08.289 --> 29:10.359
If a few die to protect my people--

29:10.690 --> 29:12.690
They're my people and I protect them.

29:13.089 --> 29:15.829
Then tell them to stay out of my way.

29:17.890 --> 29:19.150
Wait.

29:31.089 --> 29:33.690
You too.  I don't need your help.

29:42.970 --> 29:45.319
I'm not sure about coming
out here by ourselves.

29:45.970 --> 29:47.579
We should've waited for Angel.

29:48.369 --> 29:52.940
As his employee, I feel it's important
to show initiative and drive.

29:53.769 --> 29:56.859
We can't just dally about--
Look!  Nancy's Petticoat.

29:58.569 --> 30:01.619
They're quite rare.  Named for
Nancy Mitford, the author...

30:02.170 --> 30:04.589
...because of her love for--
Right.

30:05.170 --> 30:08.430
- Shoving off.
- I wonder where they keep the compost?

30:09.369 --> 30:11.400
I'd say we follow our noses.

30:12.369 --> 30:13.279
Wait!

30:16.569 --> 30:19.829
Wait, okay? We shouldn't have
come here.  Smells like flower poop.

30:20.769 --> 30:24.180
The portal will open soon,
and only for a short while.

30:24.970 --> 30:28.690
When the proper coordinates align,
we must move to the entry point.

30:29.769 --> 30:32.819
You will escort it there,
ensure its quick return...

30:33.369 --> 30:34.700
...and then rejoin us.

30:35.170 --> 30:37.339
We have a lot of work to do here.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.819
It can go home now.

30:40.569 --> 30:41.940
Would it like that?

30:43.569 --> 30:47.049
- Would it like to go home?
- It is happy to go...

30:47.769 --> 30:49.380
...as soon as you say.

30:50.769 --> 30:52.559
And don't you feel better now?

31:03.369 --> 31:06.279
- We've recovered two this month.
- It means nothing.

31:07.569 --> 31:10.170
This won't stop until we find Jhiera.

31:40.650 --> 31:43.460
Jhiera!  Just when I need
the artistic eye of a goddess.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.509
Where are the girls?

31:46.049 --> 31:48.220
And namaste to you.
Where you left them.

31:48.450 --> 31:49.779
You okay? You look spun.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.660
- How are they doing?
- They're chilling.

32:10.650 --> 32:13.180
The little sisters are fine.
REM-ing.

32:13.650 --> 32:15.119
Tell me what's up.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.779
- They took the girl.
- Man, that's lame.

32:20.849 --> 32:23.940
They will find us before too long.
We must go from here.

32:24.450 --> 32:26.839
The girls aren't ready.
They need isolation...

32:27.450 --> 32:30.500
...and temperature adjustment
before they can go out.

32:31.049 --> 32:34.630
- We'll move them someplace else.
- My shaman has a place in the desert.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.299
He can't turn away scantily
clad women, from any dimension.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.400
You need work on your mirth chakra.

32:43.049 --> 32:45.650
- If we can trust him, we'll go.
- He's good people.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.210
Then call him.

32:48.450 --> 32:51.539
If he accepts us, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.

33:07.049 --> 33:10.349
- Still no answer.
- I bet he forgot to turn it on again.

33:10.650 --> 33:14.829
You'd think a guy who can use a
Scythian bow could use a cell phone.

33:17.250 --> 33:20.970
- So, what now?
- We head back and find Angel.

33:21.450 --> 33:26.019
Great. Lead the way.
Low and slow.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.509
Hide, hide, hide.

33:31.650 --> 33:32.519
Sir!

33:32.849 --> 33:34.390
- We've found them.
- Where?

33:35.250 --> 33:39.819
An ice worker says he's been shipping
two tons of ice weekly to this place.

33:40.650 --> 33:45.220
Gather the men.  Prepare them to
capture the princess and cut them all.

33:52.650 --> 33:55.180
What are you doing?
We nearly got burned...

33:55.650 --> 33:57.299
...and you're here showering?

33:58.049 --> 34:00.009
- Hello?
- She's especially agitated...

34:00.450 --> 34:02.839
...because we tried calling
during a situation.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.059
I had to take a shower.

34:07.049 --> 34:10.809
- What's up?
- The demons said they found someone.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.849
And they said they would
cut the "princess"...

34:14.849 --> 34:16.849
...which I imagine is
not a happy thing.

34:17.849 --> 34:20.449
You'd be right on that one.
We gotta find her first.

34:20.849 --> 34:24.360
The demon said something about a lot
of ice being delivered somewhere.

34:25.050 --> 34:27.150
- Ice?
- Yeah.

34:30.449 --> 34:33.329
- Shipping order address.  Let's go.
- That's it?

34:34.050 --> 34:35.130
They seemed....

34:36.449 --> 34:38.518
There were a lot of them.
We need a plan.

34:38.849 --> 34:42.539
We go in, I hit people hard
in the face.  See where it takes us.

34:59.289 --> 35:00.969
Wait here.  I want a warning.

35:01.690 --> 35:02.670
All right?

35:05.289 --> 35:06.449
Wesley!

35:22.090 --> 35:23.489
- Welcome!
- Where's Jhiera?

35:23.889 --> 35:26.210
Sorry, no Jhiera here.
But I see I can help you.

35:26.889 --> 35:29.239
- Let's start with the clothes.
- She's in trouble.

35:29.889 --> 35:32.420
- Men are coming for her.
- Where are you from?

35:32.889 --> 35:34.469
You don't want to know.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.480
You?  I thought I made it clear.

35:43.090 --> 35:45.260
- They're coming.
- We're leaving tomorrow.

35:45.489 --> 35:46.219
Not soon enough.

35:46.690 --> 35:48.510
- They're coming.
- That would be now.

35:50.289 --> 35:51.619
Help get the girls out.

35:52.090 --> 35:53.559
Stall them as long as you can.

35:55.090 --> 35:57.159
I'm helping you
whether you like it or not.

35:59.889 --> 36:03.400
Oh, my.  You're--
Allow me to introduce myself.

36:04.690 --> 36:05.769
Wesley!

36:07.090 --> 36:09.230
How about a clay massage?
We heal, brothers.

36:43.010 --> 36:46.099
- That outfit quite becomes you.
- Wesley, get a grip.

36:47.210 --> 36:49.000
They can't hold them off long.

36:50.210 --> 36:53.510
My, what a grip.  Very healthy.

36:53.809 --> 36:55.489
Surprisingly firm myself.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.400
- Feel.
- You're pathetic...

36:58.010 --> 37:00.010
- ...and about to get fried!
- No, but...

37:01.010 --> 37:02.519
...just one kiss goodbye?

37:28.610 --> 37:30.570
- Jhiera and the runaways are ours.
- No.

37:31.010 --> 37:32.690
Give them back or the humans die.

37:37.610 --> 37:38.800
Then they die.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.260
Hold it!

38:04.010 --> 38:05.409
Hold it still.

38:07.610 --> 38:08.519
Time to go home.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.309
Let her go or your leader's dead.

38:26.809 --> 38:28.110
Go. Go!

38:46.010 --> 38:47.900
- Don't bring your war here.
- I have to.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.869
If this enemy persists,
our society crumbles.

38:51.409 --> 38:54.889
- Here, you'll have another enemy.
- You don't understand, human.

38:55.610 --> 38:56.909
No, I don't.

39:01.610 --> 39:03.289
And I'm not human.

39:04.010 --> 39:06.429
If I were you, I'd grab
the next portal out.

39:31.889 --> 39:32.900
Sorry.

39:33.090 --> 39:34.809
- I had a--
- Mushing didn't work?

39:35.489 --> 39:37.309
Not to worry.  My fault, I'm sure.

39:37.889 --> 39:40.280
Really.  Cagey little brutes,
aren't they?

39:40.889 --> 39:43.239
I'll wash them individually.
They'll be like new.

39:43.889 --> 39:44.829
- Better.
- Stop.

39:45.090 --> 39:47.690
You groveling isn't just
a way of life, it's an art.

39:48.090 --> 39:51.250
I don't grovel.  Don't fire me.
Yesterday was an anomaly.

39:52.289 --> 39:55.590
- I'm rarely taken hostage.
- Good, and you're not fired.

39:55.889 --> 39:57.539
- I'm not?
- It wasn't your fault.

39:58.289 --> 40:01.909
- You handled yourself very well.
- That's--  I can't tell you how--

40:03.690 --> 40:06.670
- I'm your faithful servant, Angel.
- Like I said, an art.

40:09.090 --> 40:11.440
Look who's here.
Can I get you something?

40:12.090 --> 40:14.050
A knife to our throat?
You can run away?

40:18.090 --> 40:19.349
Come on in.

40:35.489 --> 40:38.019
The girls are safe, outside the city.

40:39.090 --> 40:41.650
Good, but you nearly got
Cordelia and Wesley killed.

40:42.090 --> 40:44.369
- I had no choice.
- Protecting the innocent...

40:45.090 --> 40:47.230
...shouldn't depend
on where they're from.

40:48.690 --> 40:51.710
An easy sentiment when
your people are free.

40:52.289 --> 40:54.179
I'm not saying you shouldn't fight.

40:55.289 --> 40:58.340
Just know that I'll stop you
if you cross the line.

40:59.489 --> 41:03.110
I don't need an extra conscience.
I'll do what I think is right.

41:04.889 --> 41:06.500
And I'll do the same.

41:09.690 --> 41:12.289
Fine.  I think we understand
each other then.

41:19.889 --> 41:21.150
I have to go.
