01:14.755 --> 01:16.389
How's he doing ?

01:16.456 --> 01:18.692
he'll be fine.
he just needs sleep.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.463
Shredder must
pay for this.

01:21.531 --> 01:23.632
i'd like to douse him
with that mutagen

01:23.699 --> 01:25.535
and turn him
into a mutant hamster.

01:25.602 --> 01:27.103
he'll pay, all right,

01:27.171 --> 01:29.974
by turning Splinter
back into a human being.

01:30.042 --> 01:31.342
stay with him, April.

01:31.410 --> 01:34.313
come on. let's find
that technodrome.

02:00.981 --> 02:05.786
now to find a new source
of technical equipment.

02:17.836 --> 02:19.604
the rat will
follow its nose

02:19.671 --> 02:22.274
to the cheese
at the end of the maze.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.511
now, watch how
my mouser

02:24.578 --> 02:26.679
follows its nose
to the rat.

02:47.273 --> 02:49.609
you see ?
there's no place

02:49.677 --> 02:51.912
for pests to hide
from my mousers.

02:51.980 --> 02:54.215
all i need is
a big company

02:54.283 --> 02:56.385
to mass produce them
for me.

02:56.452 --> 02:57.820
<i>in large quantities, </i>

02:57.888 --> 03:00.624
<i>they could solve
the city's rat problem. </i>

03:00.691 --> 03:02.927
including my problem

03:02.994 --> 03:04.862
with a rat
named Splinter.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.165
ha ha ha ha ha ha !

03:07.233 --> 03:10.436
so, do you think
ajax pest control

03:10.504 --> 03:12.806
would be interested
in my invention ?

03:12.873 --> 03:15.475
well, to put it
in a single word...

03:15.543 --> 03:17.512
get outta here !

03:17.580 --> 03:21.150
hey ! you can't
do this to me.

03:21.218 --> 03:23.286
get rid of
all rats, huh ?

03:23.354 --> 03:24.521
what are you, crazy ?

03:24.589 --> 03:27.325
you want to drive me
out of business ?

03:29.227 --> 03:30.763
the short-sighted fool

03:30.830 --> 03:32.264
doesn't know
what he's missing.

03:32.331 --> 03:34.534
w-who are you ?

03:34.602 --> 03:37.638
someone who wants to
produce your mousers

03:37.706 --> 03:39.774
on a vast scale.

03:39.842 --> 03:43.645
well, it's about time
somebody discovered me.

03:43.713 --> 03:46.115
man, we are
lostola.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.084
this stinks.
we haven't seen a trace

03:48.152 --> 03:49.986
of the technodrome
all day.

03:50.054 --> 03:51.322
we've got
to keep searching.

03:51.390 --> 03:53.024
we still have
the upper hand.

03:53.091 --> 03:54.660
you call this
the upper hand ?

03:54.728 --> 03:57.463
we've got the Shredder
on the run, Raphael.

03:57.531 --> 03:58.899
and he's the key
to returning

03:58.966 --> 04:01.200
master Splinter
to his human form.

04:01.269 --> 04:03.170
what a dump !

04:03.238 --> 04:06.074
i thought you said
you had a big business.

04:06.142 --> 04:09.512
i do. in fact,
it's enormous.

04:11.148 --> 04:12.683
with this,
you can start work

04:12.750 --> 04:15.019
on a master control
for the mousers.

04:15.086 --> 04:16.688
master control ?

04:16.755 --> 04:18.356
what's wrong
with this ?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.360
by dawn, i will
have constructed

04:20.427 --> 04:22.729
hundreds of
these robots.

04:22.797 --> 04:24.632
it will take massive amounts
of computer power

04:24.699 --> 04:26.268
to run them all.

04:26.335 --> 04:29.338
so get to work.

04:32.877 --> 04:34.711
in a few hours,
baxter stockman,

04:34.779 --> 04:37.115
your mousers
will rule the city.

04:37.182 --> 04:39.818
not a single rodent
will survive.

04:44.791 --> 04:48.062
hmm. that guy must really
have a thing about rats.

04:48.129 --> 04:50.398
let's check
up there.

04:50.466 --> 04:51.666
Donatello,

04:51.734 --> 04:53.134
the technodrome
isn't up,

04:53.202 --> 04:54.637
it's down.

04:54.705 --> 04:57.074
at this point,
anything is worth a try.

04:59.711 --> 05:02.379
i hope this leads
someplace interesting.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.618
nope. i thought not.

05:05.685 --> 05:08.154
uh, Raphael ?

05:08.222 --> 05:09.823
what ?

05:09.890 --> 05:10.992
duck !

05:16.799 --> 05:19.569
this is not my idea
of a good time.

05:22.841 --> 05:25.176
<i>analysis of mouser
complete. </i>

05:25.245 --> 05:28.113
<i>ready to commence

05:28.180 --> 05:31.618
bebop, rock steady,
activate the machinery.

05:31.685 --> 05:37.191
<i>Shredder,
i want to talk to you. </i>

05:37.260 --> 05:39.962
what is it this time ?

05:40.029 --> 05:45.202
why are you wasting time
building mousetraps

05:45.269 --> 05:50.976
when you have yet to
provide me with a body ?

05:51.043 --> 05:53.413
my problem
is more urgent.

05:53.481 --> 05:55.582
Hamato Yoshi
and his accursed turtles

05:55.649 --> 05:57.251
will ruin us
if they're not--

05:57.319 --> 05:58.218
flehhh !

05:58.286 --> 06:00.055
there would
be no problem

06:00.122 --> 06:03.525
if i had a body.|

06:03.593 --> 06:05.227
this is my fight.

06:05.295 --> 06:08.364
i must have the honor
of destroying them.

06:08.432 --> 06:11.736
Saki,
come back here !

06:11.804 --> 06:14.740
twice those turtles
defeated you, Saki.

06:14.808 --> 06:19.245
i hope you fail
again and again

06:19.313 --> 06:21.749
and keep failing

06:21.817 --> 06:25.253
until at last
you have no choice

06:25.321 --> 06:28.257
but to give me
a body.

06:31.796 --> 06:34.365
excellent. an exact
reproduction.

06:34.432 --> 06:36.767
perfect down
to the last detail.

06:40.374 --> 06:42.943
we got 12 done already.

06:43.010 --> 06:46.714
i should wait until
the first batch is done...

06:46.782 --> 06:49.184
but no. i can't wait
to try them out.

06:49.252 --> 06:52.022
they will succeed where
you mutants failed me.

06:52.089 --> 06:53.957
uh...

06:54.025 --> 06:57.227
seek out Hamato Yoshi

06:57.295 --> 07:00.032
and destroy him !

07:00.099 --> 07:01.299
ha ha ha !

07:04.071 --> 07:05.704
i don't get it.

07:05.772 --> 07:08.208
we've toured
this whole burg,

07:08.276 --> 07:09.810
and no technodrome.

07:12.781 --> 07:13.815
whoa !

07:13.883 --> 07:15.317
Raphael !

07:15.385 --> 07:17.187
somebody toss me
a rope.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.291
they aren't
paying me enough

07:20.359 --> 07:21.659
to take this kind
of abuse.

07:23.296 --> 07:24.830
how are you feeling ?

07:26.768 --> 07:28.735
a little better.

07:28.803 --> 07:31.739
Oroku Saki gave me
quite a going-over.

07:31.807 --> 07:33.174
listen, i gotta go.

07:33.242 --> 07:35.344
i haven't been home
since i met you guys.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.413
i gotta check my mail,
get girled up,

07:37.481 --> 07:39.082
see if i still have a job.

07:39.149 --> 07:41.451
of course.
i hope we haven't

07:41.519 --> 07:43.988
interfered too much
with your life, April.

07:44.055 --> 07:47.259
oh, only... totally.
heh heh.

07:47.326 --> 07:49.996
tell those 4 turtle boys
i'll be back soon.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.934
so, Oroku Saki,

08:20.002 --> 08:22.604
you're reduced to
sending machines after me.

08:34.953 --> 08:36.589
hang on,
master Splinter.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.630
get off of my bo.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.667
rock and roll !

08:50.742 --> 08:53.410
all right. who's gonna
clean up this mess ?

08:53.477 --> 08:56.348
where'd these metal maniacs
come from ?

08:56.415 --> 08:58.050
where do you think,
Michelangelo ?

08:58.117 --> 09:01.355
trademark--
"baxter stockman inventions. "

09:01.422 --> 09:04.859
what kind of idiot puts
his name on a death machine ?

09:04.926 --> 09:07.195
an idiot with
an ego problem ?

09:07.262 --> 09:09.798
i don't know
who baxter stockman is,

09:09.866 --> 09:11.801
but i can practically
smell the Shredder

09:11.869 --> 09:13.069
behind all this.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.337
oh, great !

09:14.405 --> 09:16.040
the guy we haven't
seen a sign of all day !

09:16.108 --> 09:19.111
we must find this
baxter stockman first,

09:19.178 --> 09:21.313
and through him
find the Shredder.

09:21.381 --> 09:23.716
i hope he's easier
to scope out

09:23.783 --> 09:25.252
than
the technodrome was.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.721
yeah. all we've got
on him is a name.

09:27.789 --> 09:29.057
i feel we need

09:29.124 --> 09:31.159
April's skills
as a reporter for this.

09:31.227 --> 09:34.230
i suggest you pay her
a visit at her apartment.

09:34.297 --> 09:36.599
you'd better come with
us, master Splinter.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.168
yeah, we don't want
any of those big mouths

09:38.236 --> 09:40.071
puttin' the bite
on you again.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.308
nonfunctional ?

09:43.375 --> 09:46.345
all 12 mousers
are out of commission ?

09:46.413 --> 09:48.647
those turtles !

09:48.715 --> 09:49.816
no matter.

09:49.885 --> 09:52.853
they may be able
to handle 12 mousers,

09:52.921 --> 09:56.424
but they'll never
be able to beat 1, 200 !

09:58.495 --> 10:02.065
whew ! i've been hanging out
in the sewers too long.

10:02.133 --> 10:04.035
running around
with mutant turtles,

10:04.103 --> 10:05.570
chasing killers
under the city.

10:05.638 --> 10:08.808
i'd almost forgotten
what real life was like.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.178
who in the world
could that be ?

10:12.246 --> 10:13.546
could we interest you

10:13.615 --> 10:16.283
<i>in a subscription to
turtle's home companion ?</i>

10:16.351 --> 10:18.887
oh, no ! why are you guys
doing here ?

10:18.955 --> 10:21.458
how did you get here ?
did anyone see you come in ?

10:21.525 --> 10:22.625
any special order

10:22.693 --> 10:24.327
you want those
questions answered in ?

10:24.395 --> 10:25.528
yes. quickly !

10:25.596 --> 10:27.330
looking for
baxter stockman,

10:27.398 --> 10:29.300
by the sewers,
and no.

10:29.368 --> 10:30.534
does that
clear things up ?

10:30.602 --> 10:33.505
i can't remember
what i asked.

10:33.573 --> 10:35.976
we're looking for
the genius who built this.

10:36.044 --> 10:38.078
his name is
baxter stockman.

10:38.146 --> 10:40.849
that's all you've got
to go on--a name ?

10:40.916 --> 10:42.685
we think he's working
with the Shredder.

10:42.752 --> 10:44.019
he's our only key

10:44.087 --> 10:45.856
to tracking down
the technodrome.

10:45.923 --> 10:48.224
well, i can see what
my computer turns up.

10:48.292 --> 10:50.227
put that back, Raphael !

10:50.295 --> 10:51.796
where do you plug
this thing in ?

10:51.864 --> 10:54.433
Splinter, why don't you
rest in the bedroom.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.104
the rest of you,
try to stay out of trouble.

10:58.171 --> 10:59.740
roger, April.

10:59.807 --> 11:01.242
you promise ?

11:01.309 --> 11:03.111
all: we promise, April.

11:03.178 --> 11:07.816
why is it i don't
quite believe you guys ?

11:09.787 --> 11:11.788
wonder if there's
anything to eat

11:11.856 --> 11:13.089
in this joint.

11:13.157 --> 11:16.460
rock ! instant pizza !

11:21.468 --> 11:23.469
let's see
if the newsroom files

11:23.538 --> 11:25.139
have anything
on this guy.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.275
<i>April, this is Vern
at the studio. </i>

11:27.343 --> 11:28.777
<i>where are you ?</i>

11:28.845 --> 11:31.748
<i>you're due in 10 minutes

11:36.220 --> 11:39.491
<i>April, this is Vern.
where are you ?</i>

11:39.558 --> 11:42.461
<i>what's happening with
your story ? call me. </i>

11:42.529 --> 11:44.898
"essence of jelly bean

11:44.965 --> 11:47.935
add one capful
to running water. "

11:48.037 --> 11:50.237
hmm. one capful, huh ?

11:55.713 --> 11:57.314
hey, team, i--

11:57.381 --> 11:59.517
ay ay ay !

11:59.584 --> 12:02.254
Leonardo,
what are you doing ?

12:02.322 --> 12:03.522
target practice.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.392
aah !

12:06.460 --> 12:09.162
uh... pizza's ready.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.898
yee-haw !

12:15.637 --> 12:18.674
i thought
i told you guys

12:18.741 --> 12:20.777
to stay out of trouble !

12:20.844 --> 12:22.312
we aren't
in any trouble.

12:22.379 --> 12:25.549
that's what
you think.

12:25.617 --> 12:28.187
here. i found baxter
stockman's address.

12:28.254 --> 12:30.890
why don't you go there
and do some damage ?

12:33.295 --> 12:35.129
there. it's done,

12:35.197 --> 12:37.899
and i'm leaving.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.502
don't you wish to see
the fruits of your labor ?

12:40.570 --> 12:43.239
ohh, no. i'm tired.

12:43.306 --> 12:45.776
i haven't slept
all night.

12:45.844 --> 12:47.445
very well. go.

12:51.851 --> 12:53.919
he knows too much.

12:53.987 --> 12:55.521
put him out of the way.

12:55.589 --> 12:57.090
take the turtle-seeking
cycle.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.648
April sure was mad.

13:16.716 --> 13:18.284
oh, well.
you know women.

13:18.352 --> 13:19.853
no, we don't.

13:19.921 --> 13:21.788
she's the first one
we ever met.

13:21.856 --> 13:23.258
stick to business.

13:23.325 --> 13:25.895
we got to find this
baxter stockman person.

13:25.962 --> 13:27.296
i hope he hasn't
had time

13:27.364 --> 13:29.532
to build any more
of those little machines.

13:31.502 --> 13:33.671
now, my children,

13:33.739 --> 13:36.808
seek out Hamato Yoshi,
the 4 turtles,

13:36.876 --> 13:39.879
and that newswoman
April O'Neil.

13:39.946 --> 13:42.148
destroy them all.

13:42.216 --> 13:48.056
ahh ! it feels so good
to be so bad.

14:07.515 --> 14:09.384
oh, what do you
want now ?

14:12.154 --> 14:14.824
time to take out
the garbage.

14:20.699 --> 14:23.067
you're no match
for Michelangelo,

14:23.135 --> 14:26.739
master of
the manriki gusari. ha ha !

14:26.807 --> 14:28.876
and you are no match
for Raphael,

14:28.943 --> 14:31.612
master of
the manhole cover !

14:31.679 --> 14:33.180
heh ! what a sucker.

14:35.719 --> 14:38.821
ok, bub, let's chat.

14:43.795 --> 14:47.299
you want to clue us in
on what this is ?

14:47.366 --> 14:49.936
it's the remote control
for my mousers.

14:50.003 --> 14:52.706
do you have any more
of these mousers ?

14:52.774 --> 14:56.344
no, but the Shredder has--
hundreds of them.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.613
and where
is the Shredder now ?

14:58.681 --> 15:00.349
i'll never talk.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.650
you'd better,

15:01.718 --> 15:05.222
or else i'm gonna
get... sarcastic.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.459
he's in an old mansion
on green street near tenth.

15:07.526 --> 15:08.793
he's got
a master control

15:08.860 --> 15:10.829
for all the mousers there.|

15:10.897 --> 15:13.800
see ? nothing beats
cutting wit.

15:13.868 --> 15:16.236
green street's all
the way downtown.

15:16.303 --> 15:19.740
yeah, how are we gonna
get there in time ?

15:19.808 --> 15:21.843
are you guys thinking
what i'm thinking ?

15:26.249 --> 15:28.752
beam generators,
frequency tracers...

15:28.820 --> 15:29.986
you know,

15:30.054 --> 15:32.357
we could really use
some of this junk.

15:32.425 --> 15:33.625
gee, Michelangelo,

15:33.693 --> 15:35.194
i didn't know
you could drive.

15:35.261 --> 15:37.697
ha ! i can't !

15:37.764 --> 15:40.033
cowabunga !

15:40.100 --> 15:42.170
uh, guys,
has it occurred to you

15:42.237 --> 15:44.772
just how easily those
mousers found Splinter ?

15:44.839 --> 15:46.275
so what ?

15:46.342 --> 15:49.679
so, if there are
hundreds of them now...

15:51.182 --> 15:53.517
April and Splinter !

15:56.455 --> 15:58.289
there.

15:58.357 --> 16:01.227
it's nice to have
a little peace and quiet.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.135
Splinter !

16:07.203 --> 16:09.103
Splinter,
wake up !

16:09.172 --> 16:11.440
what's the matter,
April ?

16:11.508 --> 16:12.876
i think
something's trying

16:12.943 --> 16:14.444
to eat
this apartment !

16:17.415 --> 16:20.753
sorry, you must have
the wrong apartment !

16:20.820 --> 16:22.821
we must
arm ourselves.

16:34.538 --> 16:36.038
hyah !

16:39.510 --> 16:42.980
i fear we're about to join
our ancestors, April.

16:43.048 --> 16:45.585
it's been swell
knowing you, Splinter.

16:47.655 --> 16:49.323
outta my way,
big mouth !

16:51.060 --> 16:52.160
fore !

16:58.569 --> 17:01.772
i don't like the sound
of that one bit.

17:03.508 --> 17:04.407
the ropes !

17:11.953 --> 17:13.887
boy, they sure
don't build 'em

17:13.954 --> 17:15.489
like they used to.

17:15.557 --> 17:18.592
well, what are we
hanging around here for ?

17:18.660 --> 17:20.462
let's go find
the Shredder.

17:25.603 --> 17:28.372
there's the mansion,
just like stockman said.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.209
so, what
do we do now ?

17:30.276 --> 17:31.744
with the equipment
in the van,

17:31.811 --> 17:33.446
i can make this thing
powerful enough

17:33.514 --> 17:35.348
to control
all the mousers,

17:35.415 --> 17:36.784
but it won't do
any good

17:36.852 --> 17:38.419
unless we shut down
the master control

17:38.487 --> 17:39.587
in that old dump.

17:39.654 --> 17:42.224
somebody's gonna have
to get in there

17:42.291 --> 17:43.593
and put it
out of commission.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.095
come on, troops.
let's do it.

17:46.162 --> 17:47.564
hang one.

17:47.632 --> 17:50.268
one turtle has a better
chance than three.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.169
well, have a fun.
drop us a line

17:52.238 --> 17:53.905
if anything
interesting happens.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.475
you could have tried to
talk me out of it, you know.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.871
now to find
the master control.

18:22.243 --> 18:25.546
not so fast,
turtle boy.

18:29.218 --> 18:32.088
so, they're all here.

18:32.156 --> 18:33.790
ha ha ha !

18:33.857 --> 18:37.795
time to give my mousers
new orders.

18:41.401 --> 18:42.935
this is stupid.

18:43.003 --> 18:45.838
there's gotta be some way
out of these ropes.

18:47.475 --> 18:49.844
waah ! uhh !

18:49.912 --> 18:52.480
of course,
i could be wrong.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.582
oh, swell.

18:53.650 --> 18:55.618
another 1,000
mouths to feed.

18:55.685 --> 18:57.121
i just hope Michelangelo

18:57.188 --> 18:59.589
managed to shut down
the master control.

19:02.161 --> 19:04.864
uhh ! now all
i have to do is--

19:04.931 --> 19:06.632
don't move.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.535
don't move.

19:08.602 --> 19:10.404
huh ?

19:10.472 --> 19:12.973
that Michelangelo.
remind me

19:13.041 --> 19:15.310
to give him a stern
talking-to...

19:15.378 --> 19:16.745
if we survive this.

19:21.553 --> 19:24.790
whoa ! i've heard of
going out of your skull,

19:24.857 --> 19:27.492
but you take the cake.

19:27.560 --> 19:29.495
listen to me.

19:29.563 --> 19:32.533
the room with
the master control

19:32.600 --> 19:34.635
is one flight up.

19:34.702 --> 19:37.204
go there
and destroy it.

19:37.273 --> 19:39.275
wait a minute.

19:39.342 --> 19:42.479
why should i believe
a talking brain ?

19:42.546 --> 19:45.983
there's no time
to argue.

19:46.050 --> 19:49.020
your friends
are in danger.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.755
hurry !

19:50.823 --> 19:52.492
i'd say
this was hopeless,

19:52.560 --> 19:54.494
but that's
too optimistic.

19:54.562 --> 19:57.397
farewell, accursed
Hamato Yoshi.

19:57.465 --> 19:59.734
heads up,
Shredder.

20:01.971 --> 20:04.907
oh, big man with a gun.

20:04.975 --> 20:07.410
come on !
fight like a turtle.

20:07.479 --> 20:10.381
ha ha ha !
missed me by a mile.

20:10.449 --> 20:13.051
you impudent idiot !

20:13.119 --> 20:15.387
come on,
chrome dome,

20:15.455 --> 20:17.190
hit me with
your best shot.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.158
you bet i will.

20:24.333 --> 20:27.570
oh, no !

20:27.637 --> 20:30.306
you'll pay for that.

20:30.373 --> 20:33.443
will you take
an i. o. u.  ?

20:33.511 --> 20:35.580
Michelangelo did it !

20:35.647 --> 20:37.282
all right !

20:37.349 --> 20:38.618
let's give these
little creeps

20:38.685 --> 20:39.852
some new
marching orders.

20:49.933 --> 20:51.568
oh, no !

21:08.890 --> 21:11.559
hmm. guess they must've
hit a gas main.

21:11.627 --> 21:13.495
that's the end
of the mousers.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.832
yes, but what about
Michelangelo ?

21:17.902 --> 21:19.604
Michelangelo !

21:19.672 --> 21:22.273
where are you ?

21:22.340 --> 21:25.978
if anything's happened to
that little twerp, i'll--

21:26.046 --> 21:27.180
oh, no !

21:29.016 --> 21:30.985
Michelangelo,
say something.

21:31.053 --> 21:33.120
say something.

21:33.189 --> 21:35.757
i just love hide-and-seek,
don't you ?

21:39.162 --> 21:40.664
well, guess what ?

21:40.732 --> 21:43.133
the technodrome's
long gone.

21:43.201 --> 21:44.703
that Shredder's
getting to be

21:44.770 --> 21:46.270
a real pain
in the tail.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.307
we need some way
to track him.

21:48.374 --> 21:50.142
that van's full of
all sorts

21:50.210 --> 21:51.377
of surveillance gear.

21:51.445 --> 21:53.480
if we could rig it up
somehow...

21:53.547 --> 21:55.817
you know what i saw
in that old house ?

21:55.884 --> 21:59.054
it was this humongous brain !

21:59.121 --> 22:03.059
it had a mouth and eyes,
and it talked to me !

22:03.126 --> 22:04.695
a talking brain,
huh ?

22:04.763 --> 22:07.264
yeah. weird, huh ?

22:07.332 --> 22:09.668
Michelangelo,
i do believe

22:09.735 --> 22:12.705
you've finally
had one pizza too many.
