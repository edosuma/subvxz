01:23.500 --> 01:25.036
So did Mom show you the pictures?

01:25.201 --> 01:27.977
Yeah, yeah. She got a little emotional.

01:28.138 --> 01:31.244
Well, if she had it her way,
Mom would have me live at home forever.

01:31.408 --> 01:33.479
Well, at least you'd save
on the rent money.

01:33.643 --> 01:35.247
Hey, do you wanna see my apartment?

01:35.412 --> 01:37.414
I can give you a tour
through the computer.

01:37.580 --> 01:40.652
- What do you mean?
- Okay. Watch. Hold on.

01:40.850 --> 01:47.495
- All right so, this is my living room.
- Oh, nice.

01:47.691 --> 01:52.572
- And then this is my balcony right here.
- It makes it nice and bright.

01:52.796 --> 01:58.303
Yeah. All right. And then
this is my dining area...

01:58.501 --> 02:01.675
- Okay.
- ...Slash dancing area.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.612
- It's big!
- Yeah.

02:03.840 --> 02:10.382
- This is my kitchen here.
- Nice. Even though you'll never use it.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.184
Hey, I can cook a little bit.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.760
Oh, your mom's worried
you're gonna starve to death.

02:14.951 --> 02:16.225
Yeah, well, I'm not going to.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.694
- Wait, Emma, you're frozen.
- Can you see me?

02:22.692 --> 02:26.606
Heh, heh, you should see your face.
Okay, okay.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.366
- Is it good?
- There. You're back.

02:28.565 --> 02:33.605
- All right, this is the bedroom over here.
- Mm. Nice.

02:33.837 --> 02:37.080
- It's still, like, super messy.
- You and your mom did good.

02:37.273 --> 02:40.914
I know. Oh, wait, I wanna show you
one more thing.

02:41.711 --> 02:44.385
Hold on one second.

02:44.614 --> 02:46.252
What's up there?

02:46.449 --> 02:49.487
This is like a little storage unit...

02:49.719 --> 02:54.293
or it could be used
for really small peep...

03:11.574 --> 03:13.611
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.882
- Why are you out of breath?
- Oh.

03:16.079 --> 03:18.252
Just doing a little ballet.
Just messing around.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.952
- Oh, you're gonna start dancing again?
- I am so bad.

03:22.152 --> 03:25.463
Oh, stop. So, what did you do today?

03:25.655 --> 03:29.000
Unpacked the whole day.
I didn't even go outside once.

03:29.192 --> 03:34.403
Dude, stop being a homebody
and go out. Go explore, you weirdo.

03:34.597 --> 03:37.976
I know. But I have to get settled first.
You know me and my OCD.

03:38.168 --> 03:42.548
- How was last night?
- Well, I ran into Alex at the wrecker.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.707
- Ugh.
- Yep, he was drunk.

03:44.941 --> 03:47.717
He kept saying how you need to get
off your high horse...

03:47.944 --> 03:50.288
and blah, blah, the usual cra...

05:13.796 --> 05:15.901
Here we go.

05:16.099 --> 05:18.602
The next stop is Essex.

05:24.374 --> 05:28.584
Holy crap. Holy crap.
Holy crap. Holy crap. Whoo!

05:32.115 --> 05:36.222
Okay, I've always wanted to
walk across this, and here I am.

05:48.731 --> 05:51.468
Per capita GDP is about 7500.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.009
That's very low
given the amount that it exports.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.912
Now, compared to the GDP of the U.S.,
which exports a...

05:58.908 --> 06:00.546
it could add trillions.

06:00.743 --> 06:05.249
I think it's 2.7 trillion to the world
economy, and most of that growth...

06:06.482 --> 06:08.758
- Emma, right?
- Yeah.

06:08.952 --> 06:12.126
Your thoughts on economic extraction,
very interest...

06:36.145 --> 06:39.957
- ...emerging markets, right?
- Yeah.

06:40.149 --> 06:43.961
- Are you a night person too?
- Kind of.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.565
I like to do most of my work
when the sun isn't out.

06:46.723 --> 06:49.533
Mm. Yeah, especially in the city.
So many distractions.

06:49.692 --> 06:51.467
- Heh.
- Um...

06:51.627 --> 06:53.300
- Do you mind if I...?
- No. Yeah, sit.

06:53.463 --> 06:56.171
- Cool. I'm Michael, by the way.
- Emma.

06:56.366 --> 07:00.337
- Are you from New York or...?
- No, I'm actually from the midwest.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.244
- Oh.
- Wisconsin.

07:02.405 --> 07:04.749
- Cool. Good cheese.
- Ha.

07:04.974 --> 07:07.011
- Yeah.
- What?

07:07.210 --> 07:09.747
Nothing. It's just that's what
everybody always says.

07:09.979 --> 07:12.152
- They talk about the cheese.
- Ah.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.191
What about you? Where are you from?

07:14.384 --> 07:17.627
Oh, I'm from Westchester.
It's about an hour north of the city.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.697
But I live here now though.

07:19.889 --> 07:22.426
- I just moved here, so...
- Oh, okay.

07:22.658 --> 07:25.867
- Yeah, like a week ago. Yeah.
- Wow.

07:26.062 --> 07:30.340
Jeez, you have so much to see,
and do and to eat.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.945
I should make you a list or something.

07:33.169 --> 07:36.241
- Yeah, yeah, that'd be totally awesome.
- Cool.

07:36.439 --> 07:40.854
Or I could... you know, I could take you
for a cup of coffee sometime.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.684
I know a lot of really good
coffee shops around here.

07:44.580 --> 07:47.026
And what if I don't like coffee?

07:47.550 --> 07:51.054
- Then I can take you to a cheese shop.
- Ha. Nice.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.224
Mm. How about sometime this week?

07:55.425 --> 07:57.803
- Yeah. Sure.
- Cool.

07:58.027 --> 08:00.803
Well, I'll text you. What's your number?

08:01.030 --> 08:05.877
- 608-473-4127.
- Great.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.837
Hello?

08:42.472 --> 08:44.418
Hello?

08:46.342 --> 08:48.822
Alex, I swear to God, if this is you...

09:05.862 --> 09:08.775
Player one. Select your match. Italy.

09:10.666 --> 09:15.843
France. England. England.

09:26.949 --> 09:28.895
Strong serve.

09:39.028 --> 09:41.167
Advantage server.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.515
- I got your text. I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

09:50.706 --> 09:52.845
I couldn't get out of bed.
Way too hungover.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.851
- Oh, God.
- I almost didn't go to class.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.252
It was actually nice
to wander around by myself.

09:57.413 --> 10:00.792
Except some guy yelled at me for
stopping in the middle of the sidewalk.

10:00.983 --> 10:02.428
I forgot that was a thing here.

10:02.585 --> 10:05.065
Oh, that's not a joke.
People are not playing.

10:05.288 --> 10:07.325
Oh, my God, this guy again.

10:07.523 --> 10:11.403
This is literally the fifth day in a row
he's texted me...

10:11.561 --> 10:13.199
and I've ignored him every time.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.172
- Is that every guy's dream?
- Yes. Thank you.

10:16.365 --> 10:20.211
Would you like to speak with him?
Because that's how I'm feeling it.

10:20.403 --> 10:23.407
But, I don't know, I found the one guy
who doesn't want that.

10:23.606 --> 10:26.951
- Wait, do you have a person?
- No.

10:27.176 --> 10:31.022
I mean, I did. I was seeing someone
back home, but, uh, we broke up.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.421
I just feel like
I needed a fresh start here.

10:33.616 --> 10:36.187
Yeah. Well, you picked the right place.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.058
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

10:38.254 --> 10:42.930
Ugh. Speak of the devil, it's Alex, my ex.

10:44.727 --> 10:49.233
Yeah, he's been texting me.
He never really took the breakup so well.

11:01.143 --> 11:02.213
Do you like empanada?

11:04.981 --> 11:06.426
Almost here.

11:11.287 --> 11:12.891
Oh...

11:15.591 --> 11:17.070
Whoa.

11:17.627 --> 11:19.903
This is huge for New York.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.269
Yeah, well, I mean,
it's kind of a trade-off.

11:22.465 --> 11:23.910
I live so far from everything.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.979
- He's really cute.
- I know, right?

11:27.169 --> 11:29.376
He came up to me in the library
out of nowhere.

11:29.572 --> 11:32.109
I knew what he was doing,
but he was pretty funny.

11:32.308 --> 11:34.515
Let's see his other photos.

11:34.744 --> 11:39.489
- He has an adorable smile, right?
- Yes, I'm sure that's what she thinks too.

11:39.682 --> 11:41.025
Poor thing.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.261
- Oh. And her too.
- Oh, my God.

11:45.421 --> 11:46.991
- Oh. And her.
- Nicole.

11:47.189 --> 11:48.190
I'm sorry.

11:48.391 --> 11:50.462
I don't I know if
I should hang out with him.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.970
- I don't know if I'm ready to date yet.
- What?

11:54.397 --> 11:56.877
- You said you wanted a fresh start.
- I do.

11:57.033 --> 11:59.639
Well, then you should absolutely
hang out with him.

11:59.835 --> 12:04.113
Hey, do you want English breakfast,
Earl grey or chamomile?

12:04.840 --> 12:07.116
Um... I'll take Earl grey.

12:15.117 --> 12:16.721
Oh, I'm serious.

12:22.692 --> 12:25.866
I have no idea.
Just started playing out of nowhere.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.440
Too much porn, girl. That's what you get.

12:28.631 --> 12:31.373
No, but come on, seriously. What was that?

12:31.567 --> 12:35.538
I don't know. You should take it to that
tech place by school. They'll look at it.

12:35.738 --> 12:38.446
They'll probably look at it for free,
you're cute.

12:39.075 --> 12:40.748
- Ugh. So annoying.
- You know.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.387
- Anything else?
- No, just the pad kee mao, please.

12:45.581 --> 12:50.758
- Okay. What's your address?
- It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A.

12:50.953 --> 12:54.059
- Should be dropped off in half an hour.
- Thank you.

12:59.595 --> 13:03.475
It's 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A.

13:03.666 --> 13:06.772
- Should be dropped off in half an hour.
- Thank you.

15:06.121 --> 15:08.362
Okay, so have the egg ready.

15:08.524 --> 15:10.231
- Okay.
- Now, go back to the pot...

15:10.392 --> 15:12.668
and make sure
you still have the whirlpool.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.400
Okay, then I'm just
gonna put it in, right?

15:15.631 --> 15:18.908
You're gonna slide it in carefully
in the center of the whirlpool.

15:19.134 --> 15:21.410
- That's the only tricky part.
- Okay.

15:21.637 --> 15:24.618
You know, so it, like, nestles in there.

15:25.875 --> 15:26.979
Careful.

15:28.477 --> 15:31.890
- Ugh. It broke again.
- You're hilarious.

15:32.114 --> 15:35.027
You go from not cooking at all
to making really fancy eggs.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.720
Well, you make it look so easy.

15:36.919 --> 15:40.628
I mean, Mom, seriously,
mine looks like egg drop soup.

15:40.823 --> 15:42.564
Do you see that?

15:42.758 --> 15:45.932
Yes, I can.
But don't worry about it, you'll get it.

15:46.161 --> 15:48.266
And have a little patience.

15:48.497 --> 15:51.774
- I'm just gonna make sunny side up.
- Okay.

15:52.001 --> 15:56.006
- So you're feeling okay out there?
- Yeah. No, I feel great.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.015
I mean, it's been a bit lonely at times...

15:59.208 --> 16:01.745
but I don't know, I guess I can
focus on myself.

16:02.044 --> 16:06.015
Um, and he asked me out for coffee so...

16:06.215 --> 16:10.061
- Where did you meet him?
- We're in the same class at school.

16:10.161 --> 16:11.837
Okay.

16:12.922 --> 16:14.868
What's so funny?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.231
Because you're just, like,
overthinking everything.

16:18.427 --> 16:19.906
Let's not get into this agai...

16:20.095 --> 16:22.265
When seeing how sustaining the stimulus

16:22.365 --> 16:26.777
could increase the challenges when
trying to normalize monetary policy.

16:26.969 --> 16:31.042
It can also lead to financial instability
and expose open ec...

16:31.240 --> 16:34.221
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Ha-ha-ha.

16:35.311 --> 16:38.986
- I think I'm gonna switch to coffee.
- Coffee? I thought you didn't like coffee.

16:39.214 --> 16:42.320
Well, I don't love it,
but I need something stronger.

16:42.551 --> 16:44.827
- Do you want another cappuccino?
- I'll get it.

16:45.054 --> 16:46.761
No, no. Let me. You got the last one.

16:46.956 --> 16:48.958
All right. Thanks.

16:52.962 --> 16:57.934
- Hi, can I have two cappuccinos?
- Yeah, I'll bring it over.

16:59.568 --> 17:02.515
- He's gonna bring it over.
- Thanks.

17:03.405 --> 17:06.909
So I'm going to this dance party thing
on the lower east side tonight...

17:07.108 --> 17:11.147
- if you wanna come with.
- Oh, that sounds fun. But I have plans.

17:11.347 --> 17:14.419
If your plans fall through
or if you change your mind...

17:14.617 --> 17:17.530
I'm a pretty good dancer, so...

17:19.989 --> 17:23.163
Wow, that was amazing.
They were just so small.

17:23.358 --> 17:24.497
Yeah, I know.

17:24.727 --> 17:27.333
- Such small movements.
- In Ireland, it's a techno...

17:27.529 --> 17:32.603
- In Ireland?
- It's an underground Irelish sect.

17:32.801 --> 17:35.111
- Irelish.
- Yeah. It's English and Irish together.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.045
Oh, that's great. Oh, my gosh.

17:37.272 --> 17:39.149
And they wear electronic kilts and stuff.

17:39.341 --> 17:43.050
- That sounds really weird, but that's...
- Yeah, but it's cool.

17:43.278 --> 17:46.452
- You should definitely check it out.
- So you like to wear skirts?

17:46.649 --> 17:48.754
- They're not skirts.
- They look like skirts.

17:48.951 --> 17:51.397
They're electronic dance blankets.

17:51.620 --> 17:54.188
- Dance blankets? Okay.
- Yeah.

17:56.358 --> 17:58.360
Nice move.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.170
Keep it up.

18:14.376 --> 18:17.289
- Hello?
- I'm looking for Ms. Taylor.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.693
- Emma Taylor, right?
- Yeah.

18:26.889 --> 18:30.063
Here you go. I just need you to sign here.

18:33.495 --> 18:35.873
- Thanks, have a good one.
- Thank you.

19:17.206 --> 19:18.742
No.

19:18.941 --> 19:20.887
You didn't sign up for anything?

19:21.076 --> 19:24.751
Sometimes they send stuff from
orientation, welcome gifts or whatever.

19:24.947 --> 19:27.223
No, I mean, there's nothing else
in the box.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.454
There is no letter, no pamphlet, nothing.
Am I crazy?

19:31.086 --> 19:33.623
- Well, it's a free razor.
- Yeah.

19:33.856 --> 19:36.735
Watch me get billed in a couple weeks.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.843
I have to take a picture of this.
This is so funny.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.016
You need to get that hat.

21:30.205 --> 21:33.550
Okay, you're gonna put on this hat.

21:33.742 --> 21:35.847
Here's what my grandmother would take.

21:38.747 --> 21:41.023
- Is that good?
- Oh, so good.

21:41.183 --> 21:42.958
- Room temperature.
- Scale of one to 10.

21:43.118 --> 21:45.724
- 7.3. 8.3.
- 7.3?

21:45.921 --> 21:47.457
- 8.3.
- See?

21:47.623 --> 21:49.625
Now you can go like this.

21:49.791 --> 21:50.861
Can you see my mouth...

22:14.816 --> 22:16.454
Beginner. Interme...

22:19.254 --> 22:20.562
Nice work.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.835
Keep it up.

22:41.276 --> 22:42.482
Hello?

22:44.546 --> 22:47.288
- Hello?
- Hey.

22:47.482 --> 22:48.586
Alex?

22:48.784 --> 22:51.355
Yeah, what,
did you forget my voice already?

22:51.553 --> 22:54.090
Why are you calling me
from a blocked number?

22:54.289 --> 22:56.326
Because you don't answer my calls.

22:56.558 --> 23:00.267
All I wanna do is say hi,
see how New York is.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.500
Okay. I told you I needed space.

23:03.699 --> 23:07.806
Oh, what, I'm smothering you again?
You are unbelievable.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.508
You act like I'm the bad guy. You're
the one who was seeing other people.

23:11.707 --> 23:15.712
For the last time, Alex, I wasn't seeing
anyone. And we were on a break.

23:15.944 --> 23:21.860
Okay, whatever. I'm over it. I'm just
calling to see how everything's going.

23:22.017 --> 23:26.124
Alex, we can't keep doing this.
We can't keep talking like this.

23:26.321 --> 23:29.700
I can't even call you to say hi?
So were we nothing then?

23:29.858 --> 23:32.361
Like we never happened?

23:32.594 --> 23:38.840
Look, we've been over this before.
I just need to focus on myself right now.

23:39.034 --> 23:43.107
And maybe somewhere down the line
we can be friends...

23:43.305 --> 23:45.911
but for now I just really need my space.

23:46.141 --> 23:49.145
So you move to New York
and just forget everything else?

23:49.311 --> 23:51.348
Okay, fine.
I'll just fucking forget you too.

23:51.546 --> 23:53.856
Have a nice fucking life, Emma.

23:56.918 --> 23:59.125
So mature.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.732
- How's Dad? Is he around?
- No. He'll be back on Friday.

25:08.890 --> 25:12.599
- Oh, right. He's in Chicago, right?
- Yeah, for the conference.

25:12.794 --> 25:15.570
But... oh, honey, you're breaking up.

25:15.764 --> 25:17.835
How about you? Feel like a New Yorker?

25:18.066 --> 25:21.479
I'm doing so good. It's so amazing here.

25:21.703 --> 25:25.651
I feel like I have a whole new sense
of freedom.

25:25.807 --> 25:29.778
Oh, and I hung out with that guy,
Michael, yesterday.

25:29.978 --> 25:31.651
We went all over New York.

25:31.847 --> 25:34.828
But we didn't do, like, touristy stuff,
so it was really nice.

25:35.016 --> 25:38.156
You sound great, Em.
So happy to see you like this.

25:38.353 --> 25:40.424
It's like the old Emma.

25:40.622 --> 25:44.001
Listen, I know I said
you might not be ready for this...

25:44.226 --> 25:49.175
and things were a little tense with us
when you left, but I was wrong.

25:49.364 --> 25:54.313
I'm sorry about all that.
I am proud of you.

25:54.503 --> 25:57.507
Oh, Mom. I wanna hug you right now.

25:57.739 --> 25:58.809
I know, me...

25:59.975 --> 26:03.787
I wanna hug you right now.
Hug you right now.

26:03.945 --> 26:06.755
Hug you... hug you right now.

26:14.523 --> 26:18.164
Stop doing that. You're insane. I can't.

26:18.360 --> 26:21.898
Oh, my God. Alex, what are you doing?

26:26.635 --> 26:31.482
Happy birthday, Emma.
It's Emma's birthday.

26:34.209 --> 26:36.155
It's my birthday too.

26:48.924 --> 26:50.335
All right.

26:52.060 --> 26:54.734
I just got home,
so I'll call you later, okay?

26:55.297 --> 26:58.938
- Wait, all your photos are gone?
- No, not all of them. Just certain ones.

26:59.167 --> 27:03.582
I mean, ones with me and Alex, and
Michael, and I don't know what else.

27:03.805 --> 27:05.842
- Does Alex have your password?
- No.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.214
And he would never do something like this.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.548
I don't know.

27:09.744 --> 27:12.452
- Are you in my photo albums?
- Yeah.

27:12.681 --> 27:15.355
- They're not in there, right?
- No.

27:15.517 --> 27:17.963
Maybe their server
got messed up or something.

27:18.119 --> 27:20.099
You're sure no one else has your password?

27:20.255 --> 27:22.893
No. I'm really careful about that stuff.

27:23.325 --> 27:26.465
- Wait. They just got back to me.
- What'd they say?

27:26.628 --> 27:29.438
Oh, God. I have to change
all of my passwords now.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.448
But you know what?
I think I can make an exception for you.

27:37.639 --> 27:40.245
- Just don't tell anyone. Okay?
- Okay.

27:40.442 --> 27:42.888
I really appreciate it.
This thing is, like, my life.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.718
Oh, my God. Of course.
Let's see. Is there anything else?

27:45.914 --> 27:48.986
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need
the administrative password...

27:49.217 --> 27:54.758
and your social security number,
and that was just a dumb joke.

27:54.956 --> 27:57.903
- I don't know why I said that.
- Okay.

27:58.059 --> 28:01.097
I'm just... yeah, but I'm gonna need
definitely the password.

28:01.296 --> 28:03.469
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.
Let me just write it down.

28:03.665 --> 28:06.942
- Oh, I'm Greg, by the way.
- Oh, yeah. Hi, I'm Emma.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.309
- Emma, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:09.471 --> 28:12.475
- And thank you again so much.
- Oh, yeah. It's no problem.

28:12.674 --> 28:15.484
- Should I close that?
- Oh, yeah. If you want to.

28:15.677 --> 28:17.281
Okay.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.823
And it was only, like,
certain photos that were gone.

28:23.018 --> 28:24.588
What was it, then?

28:24.786 --> 28:26.857
I don't know. My laptop was fine though.

28:27.022 --> 28:28.592
There's no viruses or anything...

28:28.790 --> 28:31.964
so I just have to be extra careful
with my passwords now.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.334
That's super sketchy.
I'm changing my passwords too.

28:35.530 --> 28:39.205
- Okay. I'm here. I'll see you later.
- Have fun.

28:39.401 --> 28:40.436
Yeah, definitely.

28:40.602 --> 28:44.277
And with all the grants and everything,
it should be pretty easy to get a job.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.452
I don't know, it's just super fascinating.

28:46.641 --> 28:50.521
I mean, so much is gonna change
in the next 10 to 20 years.

28:50.712 --> 28:55.627
- Yeah. Also, robots.
- Ha-ha-ha. Yes. Robots.

28:55.784 --> 28:57.320
Mm-hm.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.730
That's my roommate. He's pretty hilarious.

28:59.921 --> 29:01.798
You should meet him. Kent?

29:03.124 --> 29:05.126
Kent, come in here.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.704
He probably has his headphones in.

29:07.862 --> 29:10.900
Ah! Ha-ha-ha. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

29:11.066 --> 29:12.875
I didn't realize that you had company.

29:13.034 --> 29:15.708
- You're an asshole.
- You should've seen your face, though.

29:15.870 --> 29:18.874
It was so sweet. I'm sorry. I'm Kent.
I'm Michael's roommate.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.713
- Emma. Nice to meet you.
- Not cool.

29:20.942 --> 29:25.152
Oh, come on, chill out.
Oh, do you guys go to school together?

29:25.347 --> 29:32.162
- Yeah, we're in the same class.
- Oh, economicals. Cool. Very cool.

29:32.587 --> 29:35.693
- Do you go to school?
- No, I'm a bartender.

29:35.890 --> 29:39.235
I actually bartend a few blocks away.
You should come in.

29:39.461 --> 29:41.566
Free shots on me. You can come too.

29:41.763 --> 29:45.836
Oh, thank you. That's the first time
you're hooking me up. That's so nice.

29:46.601 --> 29:48.581
Okay. Well, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.181
Yeah. It's right back there.

29:50.338 --> 29:52.682
By the way, I'm going out of town
for a few days...

29:52.841 --> 29:54.514
so you have the place to yourself.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.020
- Dude, what? Who is she?
- That's the chick I told you about, man.

29:58.179 --> 29:59.886
Oh, my God. Tell me you got in there.

30:00.081 --> 30:03.585
I'm not. You barging in like a douche bag
doesn't exactly help set the mood.

30:03.785 --> 30:05.731
She's so fucking hot. Please get in there.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.731
Okay, she's gonna hear you.
Chill out. Would you please leave?

30:08.923 --> 30:11.494
Okay. Okay. But you know
where the penis goes, right?

30:11.693 --> 30:13.639
- The penis goes in your mouth.
- The vagina.

30:13.795 --> 30:15.638
It goes in your mouth. Yeah, I do know.

30:15.864 --> 30:17.810
- You need so much help.
- I appreciate that.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.502
I'm probably gonna listen.

30:21.603 --> 30:23.412
You guys have been hanging out a lot.

30:23.571 --> 30:28.714
I know. I keep telling myself I can't fall
into something. I can't fall into something.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.653
- Maybe just fall into his bed then.
- Oh, gosh.

30:32.881 --> 30:36.954
No, I want to. It's just, I don't know,
I feel like I should wait.

30:37.152 --> 30:39.223
Might be a little bit too soon
after my ex.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.163
But Michael is awesome, right?
And he's so cute.

30:42.390 --> 30:44.131
And he's really funny.

30:50.632 --> 30:53.169
God, again. I keep getting
these weird text messages.

30:53.401 --> 30:54.573
- From who?
- I don't know.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.978
- They're all from a blocked number.
- What does it say?

30:58.173 --> 31:00.847
It says, "you never told me
how you were doing."

31:01.609 --> 31:04.317
I mean, I get weird texts too sometimes...

31:04.546 --> 31:07.117
from people who are, like,
dialing the wrong number.

31:09.651 --> 31:11.925
That's it, that's it, that's it!

31:13.955 --> 31:17.801
Bye bye birdie, he got in four.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.106
Sound on for the home team.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.779
Please enter your password.

31:29.003 --> 31:32.780
This number is not valid.
Please enter your password.

31:35.210 --> 31:39.158
This number is not valid.
Please enter your password.

31:40.849 --> 31:45.093
You have four saved messages.
First saved message.

31:45.286 --> 31:47.596
Hi, this is Patrick
from financial services.

31:47.789 --> 31:50.531
Message skipped. Next message.

31:50.725 --> 31:52.966
Hey, Em. It's Mom.
Give me a call when you can.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.469
I'm planning Thanksgiving...

31:54.629 --> 31:57.166
and I forget what days you have off.
Love you, bye.

31:57.365 --> 32:01.040
Oh, my gosh. He's so cute.
I've wanted a cat for so long.

32:01.202 --> 32:03.239
- You should get one.
- Been thinking about it.

32:03.471 --> 32:07.248
I had two amazing cats growing up.
Winkle and Oreo.

32:07.475 --> 32:08.613
Winkle?

32:12.747 --> 32:15.159
- Love, 15.
- Your noises are really distracting.

32:15.350 --> 32:18.490
I'm sorry. Oh, oh.

32:19.153 --> 32:20.427
Stop.

32:22.390 --> 32:23.869
Eh.

32:24.425 --> 32:26.496
You sound like you're gonna throw up.

32:27.262 --> 32:28.673
I am. Hah!

32:28.863 --> 32:31.776
- Stop your noises.
- Strong rally.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.038
Does the more forceful I do it
make it more forceful?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.045
- No.
- I don't wanna throw my shoulder...

32:36.204 --> 32:40.448
- Game, set, match.
- Again. Once again. I'm the best.

32:40.675 --> 32:43.781
- Not fair.
- I won again.

32:51.185 --> 32:53.859
I think maybe we should slow down.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.092
I don't want to, but I just...

32:56.291 --> 32:59.067
- I think that we should.
- Yeah. Totally.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.571
There's no need to rush things.

33:18.112 --> 33:19.455
Cute.

33:20.281 --> 33:24.752
My dad got it for me when I was little.
It reminds me of home.

34:24.779 --> 34:26.349
Hello?

34:41.963 --> 34:43.704
Hello?

35:24.505 --> 35:26.712
Finding your location.

35:28.710 --> 35:34.524
You're near eighth street
and university place.

35:34.716 --> 35:38.755
We are looking for someone to lead it,
a grad student.

35:38.953 --> 35:41.593
And I thought of you right away.

35:41.923 --> 35:46.269
Now, it's a great opportunity,
but do not feel obligated.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.737
But if it's something that might
interest you...

35:48.930 --> 35:51.536
I could recommend you to the department.

35:51.699 --> 35:56.205
Wow. Wow, thank you. I'm so flattered.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.442
No pressure. If you need some time
to think about it, that's fine.

35:59.607 --> 36:03.145
- Take your time.
- No. Yeah, I'm definitely interested.

36:03.377 --> 36:06.950
I just wanna make sure
that I have the proper time.

36:07.148 --> 36:08.957
Yeah, good.

36:09.884 --> 36:12.160
So how are you settling in?

36:12.386 --> 36:14.127
I think he was flirting with me.

36:14.355 --> 36:15.629
- No way.
- No, I'm serious.

36:15.790 --> 36:17.565
He kept telling me to call him Chris.

36:17.759 --> 36:21.901
- Is he cute? How old is he?
- Nicole, come on, he's like 50.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.076
I mean, it sounds like an easy A.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.176
Well, maybe I should introduce you to him.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.244
Maybe you should.
I have a thing for older men.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.975
- Shit, I gotta run. Talk to you later, okay?
- All right. Bye.

37:36.737 --> 37:39.047
You've got to be kidding me.

37:44.645 --> 37:47.387
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.755
I'm so glad that you called, I was just...

37:49.984 --> 37:53.727
I'm living with Michael right now
and he just sent me porn.

37:53.888 --> 37:55.959
Whoa, kinky.

37:56.157 --> 37:59.001
No, awkward.
He just sent it to me out of nowhere.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.536
Yeah, that's a little weird.

38:01.863 --> 38:06.175
- He just told me that I make him nervous.
- What? What does he mean?

38:06.367 --> 38:09.837
I don't even know how to respond to this.

38:10.037 --> 38:13.348
I mean, I'm just saying,
"that's nice of you to say."

38:13.541 --> 38:15.578
Where's he going with all this?

38:16.911 --> 38:19.255
- What the hell?
- What? What now?

38:19.480 --> 38:21.926
"I've been wanting to talk to you
for a long time."

38:22.083 --> 38:24.927
What is this guy's deal?

38:26.587 --> 38:29.500
- Wait, he just sent me another link.
- Here we go.

38:32.693 --> 38:34.263
Okay, this is getting super weird.

38:34.428 --> 38:36.601
He just sent me a video of me
from high school.

38:36.764 --> 38:40.109
Really? This guy's all over the place.

38:40.301 --> 38:43.714
Holy shit, I totally forgot about this.

38:43.871 --> 38:47.318
My mom posted this, like, forever ago.

38:47.541 --> 38:49.714
Why did he send it to you?

38:50.745 --> 38:53.419
- I don't know.
- How weird.

38:54.548 --> 38:58.223
- I just asked him how he found it.
- Can't wait to hear this.

39:00.321 --> 39:06.328
- "You can get anything on the Internet."
- Whoa, okay, creeper alert.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.062
What is he doing?

39:08.262 --> 39:10.105
Why were you sending me weird shit?

39:10.264 --> 39:11.743
Wait, wait, wait, what?

39:11.899 --> 39:14.470
I don't know what you're talking about,
I'm not even online.

39:14.635 --> 39:16.546
Okay, are you serious? Is this a joke?

39:16.737 --> 39:18.739
It's not funny, I was just talking to you.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.476
Okay, first of all, calm down.

39:20.675 --> 39:24.122
I haven't touched my computer all night,
so I don't know what's going on.

39:24.312 --> 39:26.553
- Well, then who was it, Michael?
- I don't know.

39:26.747 --> 39:28.556
Are you sure it came from my e-mail?

39:28.749 --> 39:31.457
Yes, the one that we always talk on.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.600
Okay, hold on, I'm checking now.
It wasn't from me, so...

39:34.755 --> 39:36.325
Someone got into my account.

39:36.557 --> 39:41.097
What? No. No, this person
knew stuff about me.

39:42.063 --> 39:45.977
- Whatever, this is so weird, I gotta go.
- Hold on, wait, hold on.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.010
Didn't you get hacked a few days ago?

39:48.202 --> 39:50.273
What if someone hacked into my account...

39:50.471 --> 39:53.452
like, to fuck with you or something?
I don't know.

39:53.641 --> 39:58.112
- I gotta go.
- Really? What, you don't believe me...

40:18.366 --> 40:21.313
Hey. Can we talk?

40:22.970 --> 40:25.348
Yeah, no, now's not really a good time.

40:25.539 --> 40:28.543
You know, I changed my password
and everything on my computer.

40:28.743 --> 40:31.246
I might actually get a new one. So...

40:31.479 --> 40:33.686
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

40:34.749 --> 40:38.697
Look, I'm not trying to blow you off, it's
just this whole situation is scaring me...

40:38.886 --> 40:42.766
and there's just a few things
I have to figure out, okay?

40:42.990 --> 40:46.699
Yeah, totally. All right.

40:56.203 --> 40:58.240
Yo, Felipe, hold up.

41:10.418 --> 41:11.795
Hey.

41:24.298 --> 41:27.142
Be careful about who you meet out there.

41:27.301 --> 41:29.110
You really think it's some rando?

41:29.303 --> 41:32.807
I don't know. I changed
my privacy settings on everything.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.611
I'm gonna change my number
when my new phone gets here.

41:35.810 --> 41:37.949
I'm not giving it out to anyone.

41:38.179 --> 41:43.060
I mean, don't take this the wrong way,
but you kind of jump into things fast.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.890
- Yeah.
- And Michael could just be another Alex.

41:46.087 --> 41:49.068
I know, but now I feel like
I can't trust anyone.

41:49.223 --> 41:51.225
Did you make sure
your bank account is okay?

41:51.392 --> 41:52.393
Yeah, it's fine.

41:52.593 --> 41:55.699
I called and told them to flag
my account for any weird activity...

41:55.896 --> 41:59.901
and I'm gonna install this antivirus
program thing that I bought.

42:00.101 --> 42:03.344
- Fifty dollars down the drain.
- That sucks.

42:33.167 --> 42:35.477
Please enter your password.

42:37.605 --> 42:41.985
You have one new voice message.
First voice message.

42:42.176 --> 42:45.521
Emma, it's Chris Williams.
Haven't heard from you in a while.

42:45.746 --> 42:48.158
Not sure if you got the e-mails
I sent you...

42:48.349 --> 42:51.728
but your fellowship interview got
bumped to tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.

42:51.886 --> 42:53.194
I'd get there a lit...

42:53.387 --> 42:57.267
Message erased. End of new messages.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.384
I just don't know why they're doing it.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.324
Is there anyone you pissed off back home?

43:26.520 --> 43:27.721
I don't think so.

43:27.821 --> 43:31.568
No, and if I did piss someone off,
why can't they just say it?

43:31.792 --> 43:33.999
Why are they hiding behind
all this bullshit?

43:34.195 --> 43:38.200
Who the hell knows?
Let's just have fun tonight, okay?

43:38.399 --> 43:42.006
- We need to get our drink on.
- Yeah, I need to clear my head.

43:42.169 --> 43:44.706
I don't know why I've been
talking about this.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.249
Exactly.

43:50.411 --> 43:51.856
How does this look?

43:53.847 --> 43:55.417
Hot.

43:56.417 --> 43:57.828
Okay, you ready?

44:17.404 --> 44:19.941
Can you take a picture of us?

44:20.140 --> 44:22.245
- You girls want a picture?
- Yeah.

44:24.578 --> 44:27.923
All right, say "gorgeous."

44:28.349 --> 44:30.420
- Wait, it's not working.
- Let me see.

44:30.618 --> 44:33.155
Let me put my number in first,
it's the least I can do.

44:33.387 --> 44:35.424
Give me the phone.
I don't want your number.

44:35.623 --> 44:41.232
Just so you have it, you know.
You can call me anytime. And done.

44:41.428 --> 44:44.068
- Do not tell me this works on other girls.
- I won't.

44:44.265 --> 44:47.144
Okay, well, we'll call you later
so you have our number too.

44:47.301 --> 44:49.941
Oh, I just deleted your number. Weird.

44:50.137 --> 44:52.743
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go.

46:01.175 --> 46:04.679
Let's eat something. I guess
we're on our way, but we can probably...

46:04.845 --> 46:06.222
- I want a muffin.
- Mm.

46:06.380 --> 46:08.223
A muffin.

46:16.156 --> 46:19.194
I have it all over me. This cab is moving.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.237
- Now it's like an old lady.
- It's moving.

46:22.229 --> 46:24.869
I'll make you look fucking fabulous.

46:46.019 --> 46:50.900
I'm gonna do a song for everybody, but...

47:02.636 --> 47:04.582
Your laugh is killing me right now.

47:44.478 --> 47:46.458
Fuck.

48:03.497 --> 48:06.376
Two rings, you let down, got that?

48:06.567 --> 48:08.478
One ring up, two rings down.

48:08.669 --> 48:11.149
- One for up, two for down.
- Beautiful.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.148
Glad I got through fifth grade...

48:13.307 --> 48:16.481
so I can understand these
very, very complicated procedures.

48:23.484 --> 48:25.828
He's not very used to lions.

48:26.019 --> 48:27.726
Good-for-nothings.

48:27.955 --> 48:30.834
How about you, my little friend?

50:26.940 --> 50:29.921
Nicole, I just got home
and my door wasn't locked.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.181
I never do that. Should I call the cops?

50:32.346 --> 50:35.850
Wait, hold on. Maybe you left it
unlocked in a rush or something?

50:36.083 --> 50:40.031
I don't think so. Shit, I don't remember.

50:40.253 --> 50:42.460
- Where are you now?
- I'm outside.

50:42.656 --> 50:45.933
Okay, take a deep breath.
You wanna just pop your head in?

50:46.126 --> 50:48.663
- I'll stay on the phone.
- Okay.

50:57.638 --> 51:01.279
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

51:01.475 --> 51:05.753
- Everything looks fine.
- Okay, that's good.

51:06.246 --> 51:08.624
- You all right?
- I don't know.

51:08.815 --> 51:11.386
Okay, I'm just gonna check
the rest of the apartment.

51:11.586 --> 51:13.225
Okay.

51:13.387 --> 51:17.200
God, I probably just left it unlocked.

51:25.999 --> 51:28.570
Does anything feel weird in there?

51:28.802 --> 51:31.806
I'm not sure, I'm still looking around.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.644
Do you want me to just come over?

51:34.841 --> 51:37.515
You sound kind of freaked out,
I feel like I could help.

51:38.879 --> 51:41.291
Hold on one second.

51:41.782 --> 51:44.592
- Just stay with me, okay?
- Okay.

52:11.044 --> 52:13.718
Emma? Emma?

52:13.914 --> 52:17.123
Emma, are you there? Emma!

52:18.685 --> 52:21.188
- Hey, sorry, I dropped my phone.
- Holy fucking Christ.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.528
Everything's fine, nothing's missing.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.968
You scared the fucking shit out of me.

52:28.195 --> 52:32.439
I'm probably just crazy. I just...
I've been so stressed out lately.

54:21.341 --> 54:24.015
Crazy easy, really rich and nice.

54:25.212 --> 54:27.192
Just brush it on, good to go.

54:27.380 --> 54:32.328
Second one we're gonna make,
whole-grain mustard, some sage...

54:32.719 --> 54:35.222
and a little bit of rice wine vinegar.

54:35.455 --> 54:40.905
Again, maybe one part:
Mustard, one part honey.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.504
A teaspoon, tablespoon of rice wi...

55:04.985 --> 55:06.555
Hey.

55:07.254 --> 55:10.098
What are you doing here?
I mean, how'd you get up here?

55:10.257 --> 55:14.706
Someone let me in,
but I brought you something.

55:15.929 --> 55:18.307
- Is that a cat?
- Is this a cat, what?

55:18.531 --> 55:21.375
No. Maybe.

55:22.302 --> 55:23.872
God, I don't believe you.

55:24.070 --> 55:27.074
- I know it seems crazy...
- Yeah, it is crazy.

55:27.240 --> 55:29.743
Well, I thought you could use
some company, you know...

55:29.910 --> 55:32.754
something to help
take your mind off of things.

55:38.118 --> 55:40.826
They said you could take
a day or two with him...

55:41.021 --> 55:43.399
and see if you guys are a good fit.

55:43.590 --> 55:46.070
His name is Clover.

55:46.259 --> 55:50.332
Clover, I want you to meet Emma. Yeah.

55:50.563 --> 55:51.837
This is your new roommate.

55:53.466 --> 55:58.643
- Clover, come here. Come here.
- Come here.

55:58.838 --> 56:01.648
Clover. Come here, bud.

56:01.841 --> 56:04.082
Oh, he's using the restroom.
Potty trained.

56:04.277 --> 56:05.415
He's using the bathroom.

56:05.578 --> 56:08.081
Make sure to put the seat up
when you're done. Or down.

56:08.248 --> 56:12.458
- Down. You train them so fast.
- I know. I'm the cat whisperer.

56:12.619 --> 56:17.932
- You think you're really clever, don't you?
- What? Me? No.

56:18.124 --> 56:21.503
Okay, what am I supposed to do?
I'm not supposed to be paranoid?

56:21.695 --> 56:25.040
No, I completely get it. Honestly, I do.

56:25.198 --> 56:28.179
You know, I actually got you
something else.

56:28.368 --> 56:32.441
I was hoping maybe you could go
to the ballet with me.

56:36.843 --> 56:38.720
Thank you.

01:02:13.446 --> 01:02:15.518
Get it, Clover.

01:02:15.682 --> 01:02:17.420
Come here.

01:02:22.922 --> 01:02:23.957
Hey.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:29.231
Hey, Emma, look,
I don't want you to get freaked out...

01:02:29.462 --> 01:02:31.738
but I just got a threat.

01:02:31.964 --> 01:02:34.342
- Wait, what?
- An e-mail.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.003
I think it's the same person
that's been harassing you.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.844
Michael, what do you mean?

01:02:40.039 --> 01:02:46.046
It's from my own e-mail, which is crazy
because I just changed the password.

01:02:47.647 --> 01:02:53.029
It says, "do not talk to her again.
You are nothing, you are nobody.

01:02:53.219 --> 01:02:55.722
You do not know what I'm capable of."

01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:02.206
Um...

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:04.973
I'm gonna call the police.

01:03:06.566 --> 01:03:09.206
There's nobody you can think of
that might be inclined...

01:03:09.402 --> 01:03:10.745
to do something like this?

01:03:10.903 --> 01:03:12.883
- Maybe an ex-boyfriend?
- No.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:16.213
That's the problem,
it's been anonymous this whole time.

01:03:16.409 --> 01:03:21.290
Okay. There's a number you can call
to get a copy of the report.

01:03:21.514 --> 01:03:23.494
Let us know if anything else happens.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:26.022
That's it?

01:03:26.185 --> 01:03:28.756
There's not much we can do.
A crime wasn't committed.

01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:31.026
There's no aggravated harassment.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.204
If it escalates, you can call us again.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.532
Look, my friend Michael
has been threatened.

01:03:35.728 --> 01:03:40.074
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I understand your
frustration, but this isn't a credible threat.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:44.742
We get calls like this all the time.
We can't pursue every one of them.

01:03:47.006 --> 01:03:49.145
I just don't feel safe.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:09.664
It's probably some 14-year-old shithead
in South Dakota...

01:04:09.896 --> 01:04:11.933
who has nothing better to do.

01:04:13.032 --> 01:04:17.674
I wouldn't let it freak you out too much.
I mean, it's weird, but...

01:04:17.904 --> 01:04:23.115
He decided to mess with me randomly?
I mean, how did they get my number?

01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:28.353
Someone banged on my door
in the middle of the night, remember?

01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:31.085
I am so paranoid now.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.129
I just feel like some freak
is gonna grab me wherever I go.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:37.825
Oh, honey, it's definitely creepy...

01:04:38.057 --> 01:04:40.367
but who knows
if that's the same person, right?

01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:43.699
I mean, the banging on the door thing,
that could be an accident...

01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:46.207
or some drunk idiot maybe?

01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:51.473
I know you're freaked out, I get it.

01:04:53.573 --> 01:04:55.348
Thank you so much for everything.

01:04:55.508 --> 01:04:57.613
That's what I do.

01:04:57.777 --> 01:05:02.192
And if anything else happens, I'm gonna
go out there and kick their ass.

01:05:02.381 --> 01:05:06.352
All right, I just got home,
so I'll talk to you later, okay?

01:05:06.586 --> 01:05:08.691
- Don't forget.
- All right.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:20.371
Clover?

01:05:39.552 --> 01:05:42.328
Hey there, you got Michael.
Leave a message.

01:05:43.756 --> 01:05:47.169
Hi, Michael, please call me
as soon as you can.

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.034
Oh, honey, the cat was from the shelter.

01:05:50.196 --> 01:05:51.869
It could have been sick. Who knows?

01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:55.568
He was fine when I left him.
He was running around, he was eating.

01:05:55.735 --> 01:05:57.214
I just... I don't understand.

01:05:57.403 --> 01:06:01.249
He could have choked
on something, that's not your fault.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.420
God, why is all this happening to me?

01:06:03.576 --> 01:06:06.182
- What do you mean, "all this"?
- What's going on?

01:06:06.345 --> 01:06:09.053
Emma, is something else going on?

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.752
No, no, I'm fine.

01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.862
No, I don't think you're fine, Emma.

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.795
I can tell when something's wrong.

01:06:16.022 --> 01:06:19.435
- Is it school?
- Come on, Emma.

01:06:19.592 --> 01:06:22.766
Look, I didn't wanna tell you guys
because I don't wanna worry you.

01:06:22.962 --> 01:06:27.536
- What?
- I think that someone's been stalking me.

01:06:27.733 --> 01:06:29.235
- Stalking? What?
- What?

01:06:29.435 --> 01:06:30.709
What do you mean?

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:34.784
I've been getting calls and e-mails,
and my friend Michael was threatened.

01:06:34.941 --> 01:06:37.285
- Threatened?
- What do you mean, threatened?

01:06:37.443 --> 01:06:39.081
Emma! Why didn't you tell us this?

01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:41.280
Because I thought that...

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.427
I don't know, I thought that I could
figure this out on my own.

01:06:44.617 --> 01:06:45.652
- Honey.
- I just...

01:06:45.818 --> 01:06:49.129
- I didn't want you guys to worry about me.
- We're flying out there.

01:06:49.288 --> 01:06:52.462
We'll find you a new place
to move. We're gonna talk to the po...

01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:02.441
Hey there, you got Michael,
leave a message.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:07.084
- We're flying out there.
- We'll find you a new place to move.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:10.345
No. God, this all came out
of nowhere. It's like a nightmare.

01:07:10.509 --> 01:07:12.352
- We're flying out there.
- Michael threatened.

01:07:12.511 --> 01:07:13.888
- Emma.
- I don't understand.

01:07:14.046 --> 01:07:15.525
- What am I supposed to do?
- Move.

01:07:15.748 --> 01:07:17.659
Do not talk to her again,
you do not know what I'm capable of.

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:21.423
I think that I need to move.
I just feel like some freak. Some freak.

01:07:45.945 --> 01:07:48.755
I know it's you, you fucking freak.

01:08:10.569 --> 01:08:13.778
- Hello?
- Alex, have you been fucking with me?

01:08:13.973 --> 01:08:16.145
- Do not lie to me.
- What?

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.649
What are you talking about?

01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:20.416
Have you been hacking my shit
or prank-calling me?

01:08:20.645 --> 01:08:22.921
Hacking your what?

01:08:23.849 --> 01:08:27.261
Get over yourself, Emma.
First you tell me to leave you alone...

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:30.229
and now you accuse me of some bullshit?

01:08:30.423 --> 01:08:31.925
Like, what?

01:08:32.158 --> 01:08:35.071
Alex, please just tell me the truth.

01:08:35.294 --> 01:08:37.103
Are you serious right now?

01:08:37.328 --> 01:08:40.173
The world doesn't revolve
around you, okay?

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:46.707
- Never mind. I'm sorry that I called.
- Whatever, Emma.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.318
- Hey.
- Hey, you all right?

01:10:03.516 --> 01:10:05.518
Um, I'm at the coffee shop.

01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:10.131
I just... I couldn't stay in my apartment,
I just felt trapped.

01:10:10.322 --> 01:10:14.532
So I guess I'll meet you
at your place later?

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.764
Yeah, I can't get out of here
until 10 now, though.

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.536
Computer system's all messed up.
Everyone's freaking out.

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.406
Are you gonna be okay?

01:10:24.036 --> 01:10:25.811
I don't know.

01:10:26.772 --> 01:10:28.615
I just feel like someone's watching me.

01:10:28.808 --> 01:10:32.278
Don't worry about it. Nothing's gonna
happen with all those people around.

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:36.016
I'll just meet you at your place tonight,
then we can cab it to my apartment.

01:10:36.215 --> 01:10:39.958
Okay, I'll let you get back to work.

01:10:40.152 --> 01:10:42.655
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

01:11:04.043 --> 01:11:06.489
Hey, sweetie, you okay?

01:11:07.313 --> 01:11:09.691
I'm just so frustrated.

01:11:10.649 --> 01:11:15.189
I'm trying to do my work but I just...
I can't concentrate.

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.563
Just don't worry about your work
tonight, just try to relax.

01:11:18.757 --> 01:11:22.830
Nicole's still coming over, right? Yeah?

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:25.338
What about Michael,
have you talked to him yet?

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.876
No. I haven't heard from him,
so I'm getting kind of worried.

01:11:29.068 --> 01:11:32.379
Oh, honey, listen,
I'm gonna be there tomorrow.

01:11:32.571 --> 01:11:36.781
We are gonna talk to the police,
we are gonna go to campus security...

01:11:37.009 --> 01:11:39.751
and we're gonna find you
a new place to live.

01:11:39.979 --> 01:11:43.927
We're gonna find a place
with a doorman, okay?

01:11:44.116 --> 01:11:47.928
Yeah. I've already started looking
at a few apartments, so...

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.122
Oh, Emma, what happened?

01:11:50.289 --> 01:11:51.768
- Mom, I don't know what...
- Emma?

01:11:51.991 --> 01:11:56.030
- I don't know what just happened.
- Honey, it's probably just a fuse that blew.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.640
- Oh, my God.
- Emma, you're scaring me. Emma.

01:11:58.864 --> 01:12:01.571
I can't... honey, I can't see you now.

01:12:01.701 --> 01:12:03.141
What is that?

01:12:03.369 --> 01:12:05.406
- Okay, I'm calling 911.
- Leave me alone!

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.744
- Oh, my God!
- Leave me the fuck alone!

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.945
- Emma! Emma, no!
- No!

01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:20.088
Please, my daughter is being attacked.
What are you doing to her?

01:12:20.719 --> 01:12:25.259
No, she's not here, she's in New York.
Please help her!

01:12:25.457 --> 01:12:28.301
Get the fuck away from her!

01:12:28.527 --> 01:12:32.100
She's not here, I'm just...
I'm on the computer. Oh, my God!

01:12:35.067 --> 01:12:38.913
Please help me! He's hurting her!

01:12:39.672 --> 01:12:43.313
Get the fuck away from her! Emma!

01:12:45.044 --> 01:12:49.584
Where's the address?
I can't find the fucking address!

01:12:50.649 --> 01:12:54.597
I can't find the address.
I can't find it, I can't find it.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:58.599
Please, don't hurt her!
Don't hurt my baby!

01:12:59.325 --> 01:13:04.365
She's 23 years old.
It's Emma, my baby girl.

01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:08.476
Who the fuck are you?
What are you doing to her?

01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:12.114
Oh, my God!

01:13:12.604 --> 01:13:14.277
I have it, I have it, I have it.

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.083
It's 8... 8... 854 Wilson Avenue,
apartment 4A...

01:13:20.279 --> 01:13:22.088
in New York. In Brooklyn, New York.

01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:25.854
Please hurry, it's my baby. Please hurry.

01:13:26.085 --> 01:13:27.792
Where are you?

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:31.662
The police are on their way.
Please don't hurt her!

01:13:31.857 --> 01:13:34.667
Emma, the police are coming.

01:13:36.128 --> 01:13:38.108
She didn't do anything.

01:13:38.297 --> 01:13:42.609
Emma, please, talk to mommy.
Talk to mommy, please.

01:13:42.801 --> 01:13:46.112
Please. I beg you.

01:13:46.305 --> 01:13:49.149
Emma? Emma?

01:13:52.244 --> 01:13:55.418
Oh, my God! Emma?

01:13:55.647 --> 01:13:58.628
Please! Please don't hurt her!

01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:03.425
No, listen to me!
Please, why are you doing this?

01:14:04.823 --> 01:14:06.564
Who are you?

01:14:06.759 --> 01:14:10.707
Listen, listen, that's my baby girl.
That's my baby girl.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.037
I'm begging you, I'm begging you.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:18.507
Emma! Oh, gosh, tell me what you want!

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:23.050
No, no, no! No, no, no, don't go!
Please! No...

01:17:21.353 --> 01:17:25.130
Police! Open the door,
we're coming inside.

01:17:29.761 --> 01:17:32.708
If anyone's in the apartment,
it's the police.

01:17:39.271 --> 01:17:42.843
Emma Taylor. I'm from the police.
