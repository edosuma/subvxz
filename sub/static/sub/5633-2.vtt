00:00.967 --> 00:02.768
You're watching The Simpsons.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.771
You know your life sucks.
Just get drunk

What is this,
and how can I make the rest
of my life about it?

00:14.515 --> 00:15.748
Only on Fox.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.657
Today's safety film <i>Don't Wear</i>
<i>Jewelry During Sports</i>

00:25.659 --> 00:27.393
has been cancelled.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.828
Instead we'll watch a movie
that made me fall in love

00:29.830 --> 00:33.699
with showing movies
I've watched to other people.

(kids booing)

00:41.841 --> 00:43.075
(exclaiming)

00:43.077 --> 00:45.244
That's right,
the 1967 classic

00:45.246 --> 00:47.413
Doctor Dolittle,
which answers the question:

00:47.415 --> 00:49.882
what if an elderly
unmarried doctor

00:49.884 --> 00:52.484
decided to focus
his practice on animals?

00:52.486 --> 00:55.254
The running time
is 152 minutes!

00:55.256 --> 00:57.089
The running time is now!

02:18.973 --> 02:20.939
You're just smelling
the old boogers in your noses.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.175
You got to pick those things--
it's called hygiene.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.610
If I may join
in the mockery,

02:24.612 --> 02:27.412
Lisa Simpson also
has an appalling odor.

Girls don't smell!

02:32.586 --> 02:34.319

02:34.321 --> 02:37.422
Sorry, girl,
but you smell.

Children can be so cruel.

ALL (singsongy):
Stink-son! Stink-son!

02:47.835 --> 02:49.801
Then they called me Stink-son.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.203
That's not even my name.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.604
What happened?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.540
Our family's been
ostracized for lots of things,

02:54.542 --> 02:57.109
but never our hygiene.

02:57.111 --> 02:59.344
Rarely
our hygiene.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.346
Never <i>my</i> hygiene!

I think I know

03:02.883 --> 03:05.184

is coming from.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.387
Mold.
(groans)

03:08.389 --> 03:10.989
It's worse than a
Grampa hug in the summer.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.491
I thought smelly
clothes only happened

03:12.493 --> 03:15.093
to working mothers.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.701
This is all the
money I've found

03:22.703 --> 03:25.470
in Homer's pants
pockets over the years.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.306
I was saving it
to buy a spice rack

03:27.308 --> 03:30.409
instead of always renting one.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.246
But I guess we'll have
to spend this money

03:34.248 --> 03:36.248
on a new washing machine.

03:36.250 --> 03:40.419
We cannot continue on

Uh, well, I wouldn't

09:53.026 --> 09:55.260
High-end barbeques like yours
are easy pickings.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.629
Smokeheads grab them at night,
clean them up.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.598
Next thing you know,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
it's cooking

10:04.638 --> 10:05.870
So, it's gone.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.872
It's really gone.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.275
All that's left is
the smell of burning hickory

tiny little wheel prints.

Snap out of it,
you big fat baby.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.564
Son, this is so much more

10:32.566 --> 10:34.666
than just losing
an outdoor cooking device.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.267
How to explain this
to a child?

10:36.269 --> 10:39.004
This is the death of hope.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.272
What are you talking about?

10:41.274 --> 10:43.241
Everything good
that comes into our lives,

10:43.243 --> 10:45.243
the universe takes away.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.445
So from now on,
I'm just gonna lie here

10:47.447 --> 10:49.781
and never care again.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.750
Come on, you know
your life sucks.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.451
Just get drunk
like you always do.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.919
I don't want to.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.021
(gasps)

10:57.523 --> 10:58.790
(moans)

10:58.792 --> 10:59.958
Look at him.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.493
He's lying there
like a beached whale

11:01.495 --> 11:02.961
waiting to explode.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.296
Maybe we should try to
track down that smoker.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.931
I don't know.

11:06.933 --> 11:08.700
The whole barbequing scene
is pretty pro-meat.

11:08.702 --> 11:11.469
And all that smoke
pollutes the environment.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.772
This isn't about your
boyfriend, the planet.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.007
I've never seen him
this beaten down.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.477
Okay, look for clues.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.845
Are there any mud
samples we can trace

11:20.847 --> 11:23.048
to local heaths and moors?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.483
Sorry, I've been watching
a lot of <i>Sherlock.</i>

11:25.485 --> 11:27.152
(barking)

11:27.154 --> 11:28.486
Knock it off, boy.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.888
I don't have any meat for you.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.556
Get down!
Wait!

11:31.558 --> 11:33.491
Santa's Little Helper
was in the yard last night

11:33.493 --> 11:35.727
when the smoker was stolen,
but he didn't make a peep.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.862
Why?

11:38.898 --> 11:40.865
(gasps)

11:40.867 --> 11:42.901
"Natural Peanut Butter."

11:42.903 --> 11:44.869
What if someone
gave this to the dog

11:44.871 --> 11:46.738
so he'd be licking
instead of barking

11:46.740 --> 11:48.807
while they took
the smoker?!

11:48.809 --> 11:50.308
(gasps)
You got a clue, boy!

11:50.310 --> 11:52.510
A clue! (laughs)

11:52.512 --> 11:53.812
Who's a smart dog?

11:53.814 --> 11:56.147
Who's
a smart dog?

11:56.149 --> 11:58.917
(panting)

11:58.919 --> 12:00.518
(barking)

12:00.520 --> 12:01.920
(panting)

12:01.922 --> 12:03.221
(bell clangs)
ANNOUNCER: <i>You're watching</i>

12:03.223 --> 12:05.356
Eat-down <i>with Scotty Boom.</i>

12:05.358 --> 12:06.991
Come on, Homie.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.095
We can't let this
Empire State jabroni beat us.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.897
This week I took on the Gilbert
family of Portland, Maine.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.767
They've been making clam chowder
for generations.

12:15.769 --> 12:18.870
How is that better than
something I spent a day on?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.438
I win!

12:20.440 --> 12:22.440
Manhattan chowder, baby!

12:22.442 --> 12:24.209
NYC!

12:24.211 --> 12:26.878
Greatest city,
greatest chowder!

12:26.880 --> 12:30.215
The Gilbert family
has learned a valuable lesson--

12:30.217 --> 12:32.851
screw everything.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.787
Dad, we're gonna
find that smoker!

12:35.789 --> 12:38.456
To try is to fail!

12:38.458 --> 12:40.024
There's only
one store in town

12:40.026 --> 12:42.427
that sells
all-natural peanut butter.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.763
(bell dings)

12:50.469 --> 12:52.971
Don't worry, I know how
to talk to these people.

12:52.973 --> 12:55.607
Thank goodness
you have organic fennel.

12:55.609 --> 12:59.577
The fennel at the farmer's
market is only transitional.

12:59.579 --> 13:01.079
(groans)
Typical.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.215
Small farmers ruining it
for the really small farmers.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.384
So, could you maybe tell me

13:06.386 --> 13:08.887
who bought this brand
of peanut butter?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.421
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.390
You want me to violate
my customers' privacy?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.058
Who are you working for?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.794
The NSA?
Big pharma?

13:15.796 --> 13:17.462
Amazon Prime?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.998
Tell us! Tell us!
Tell us! Tell us!

13:20.000 --> 13:20.999
(moans)

13:21.001 --> 13:22.433
My hoops!
(grunting)

13:22.435 --> 13:24.836
My ridiculous flesh hoops!

13:26.405 --> 13:27.839
There!

13:27.841 --> 13:29.407
Someone's ringing
up peanut butter.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.543
(both gasp)
Nelson!

13:33.012 --> 13:34.679
What are you playing
there, Nelson?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.447
<i>Clash of Castles?</i>

13:36.449 --> 13:37.816
So what if it is?

13:37.818 --> 13:39.417
Your castle's
pretty well-defended.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.451
Level six catapults.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.986
Level seven sorcerers.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.088
Maxed-out trolls.
(whistles)

13:44.090 --> 13:46.491
Uh, yeah, well.
(clears his throat)

13:46.493 --> 13:48.426
Yeah, gets the job done.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.196
I tell you, those are
some nice upgrades.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.031
Expensive upgrades.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.633
Upgrades like
that cost gems.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.669
And gems cost cash.

13:57.671 --> 13:59.637
Expensive cash.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.005
Where'd you get
the cash, Nelson?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.207
I don't use gems!

14:02.209 --> 14:04.676
I'm a grinder!
A grinder!

14:04.678 --> 14:06.044
(grunts)

14:06.046 --> 14:08.279
(yelling)

14:08.281 --> 14:09.948
(both moaning)

14:09.950 --> 14:12.016
(moaning continues)

14:18.524 --> 14:19.858
(gasps)

14:19.860 --> 14:21.125
(whimpering)

14:21.127 --> 14:22.727
(both scream)

14:22.729 --> 14:24.696
What are they?

14:24.698 --> 14:26.698
They're like televisions...

14:26.700 --> 14:29.067
but they just keep going!

14:29.069 --> 14:30.869
He's meeting
with someone.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.971
That's always
a sign of guilt.

14:37.977 --> 14:39.043
Hope you don't mind.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.545
I cooked some dinner on it.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.082
Mmm. (sniffs)

14:44.084 --> 14:46.918
Ah, smell you later.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.023
("Take the A Train" by Duke
Ellington ringtone plays)

14:52.025 --> 14:53.258
(phone beeps)

14:53.260 --> 14:55.927
This is our chance.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.896
BOTH:
Hot! Hot!

14:57.898 --> 14:59.264
Hot!

14:59.266 --> 15:00.932
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

15:00.934 --> 15:02.367
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

15:02.369 --> 15:03.668
(gasps)

15:05.204 --> 15:07.071
(tires squealing)

15:07.073 --> 15:08.940
(crickets chirping)

15:08.942 --> 15:11.009
(groans)

15:11.011 --> 15:12.043
(both groan)

15:12.045 --> 15:13.945
The universe
does hate us.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.080
It feels good
to surrender.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.949
(all groan)

15:17.951 --> 15:19.751
Good girl, Maggie.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.719
Give up young.

15:21.721 --> 15:24.088
(panting, barking)

15:29.728 --> 15:31.296
(all groaning)

15:31.298 --> 15:33.197
Get up off that floor!

15:33.199 --> 15:35.199
We are on
a head-to-head cook-off

15:35.201 --> 15:38.603
that'll be shown on TV
and probably some planes.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.605
We don't have the smoker.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.974
Just let us forfeit
with dignity.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.776
We still have to try.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.211
This isn't a family of quitters.

15:47.213 --> 15:48.546
Sure we are.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.949
We always have been
and more so now.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.583
I'm a quitter.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.218
And I'll back down to anyone
who says I'm not.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.821
Come on,
Buddhists aren't quitters.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.423
Actually, Mom,
Buddhism is really

15:58.425 --> 16:00.558
just quitting in yoga pants.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.261
This is a Live Strong bracelet.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.229
Lance Armstrong
never quit.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.798
He never quit
the Tour de France.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.667
He never quit lying
about his steroid use.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.569
And he still hasn't
totally come clean.

16:11.571 --> 16:14.105
Now get in the car!

16:14.107 --> 16:15.239
(lively chatter)

16:15.241 --> 16:18.509
MOE:
Eat-down! Eat-down! Eat-down!
Yee-haw!

16:20.245 --> 16:22.680
I can handle this
barbeque competition.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.250
All I need is a little
help from an old friend.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.121
I'm Alton Brown

16:30.123 --> 16:32.023
and welcome to <i>Eat-down!</i>

16:32.025 --> 16:35.259
Today Scotty Boom
takes on the Simpsons in...

16:35.261 --> 16:37.628
(bell clanging)

16:37.630 --> 16:39.864
And I can tell you this--
it will be edited

16:39.866 --> 16:42.266
to be dramatic.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.268
Marge, do you
think your meat

16:44.270 --> 16:46.270
has what it takes
to win this Eat-down?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.106
It sure does.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.807
Homer, what about you?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.209
No way in hell.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.643
What about you kids?

16:52.645 --> 16:54.212
Are you pumped up
to beat Scotty Boom?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.014
Happiness is an illusion.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.383
What she said.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.617
Looks like the Simpsons
are playing

16:59.619 --> 17:01.386
mind games with you,
Scotty.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.187
Are you feeling
the pressure?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.622
No pressure.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.858
I'm throwing down
the taste of New York.

17:06.860 --> 17:10.194
My recipe's infused with
Times Square, the Bronx Zoo

17:10.196 --> 17:12.497
and the <i>Sex and the City</i>
<i>walking tour.</i>

17:12.499 --> 17:14.298
The Simpsons better
bring their A game.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.467
HOMER:
F! F game!

17:17.970 --> 17:21.239
I call this my
Never-Give-Up Brisket.

17:21.241 --> 17:25.309
The secret ingredient
is hope.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.311
Mm?

17:27.313 --> 17:28.312
(spits)

17:28.314 --> 17:30.548
How many spices
did you put in this?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.183
All of them.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.252
(all groaning)

17:35.554 --> 17:38.489
(audience oohing)

17:38.491 --> 17:42.160
I've never seen such
unusual grill marks.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.263
This pattern looks
like a honeycomb.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.664
What?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.900
That meat was cooked
on the Hive!

17:48.902 --> 17:52.336
This garlic-sucking tunnel trash
stole our smoker!

17:52.338 --> 17:54.005
Ah, this little
flyover's crazy.

17:54.007 --> 17:57.742
I cooked that meat myself
right here over here.

17:59.344 --> 18:02.180
The grill marks don't match.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.582
Dead meat doesn't lie.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.350
(audience gasping)

18:06.352 --> 18:07.385
(gasping)

18:07.387 --> 18:09.554
Scotty Boom, you are
hereby banned

18:09.556 --> 18:11.355
from the Chew Network.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.791
You are no longer
a celebrity chef.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.593
You're just a chef.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.928
Take him away, Chief.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.963
Grand theft smoker.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.431
Sounds like a crime to me.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.137
Apparently,
the winner of the Eat-down

18:26.139 --> 18:28.139
is the Simpsons.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.208
(cheering)

18:30.210 --> 18:31.809
Isn't this a
little too easy?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.378
Why would a professional
chef cheat?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.380
And how does Nelson fit in?

18:36.382 --> 18:38.816
And where the heck
is our smoker?

18:38.818 --> 18:41.819
("Take the A Train" by Duke
Ellington ringtone plays)

18:41.821 --> 18:43.154
(phone beeps)

18:43.156 --> 18:46.624
That's the ringtone
from the scrapyard!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.059
LISA:
Get him!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.764
Bones! Bones!

18:53.766 --> 18:55.566
I'm covered in death!

18:55.568 --> 18:56.834
(gasps)

18:58.570 --> 19:00.805
My hoops!

19:00.807 --> 19:02.406
Dad, stop him!

19:02.408 --> 19:04.242
I'm done trying.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.177
Dad, please!
No one's asking you to care.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.179
Just trip a stranger!

19:08.181 --> 19:10.248
(grumbles)

19:19.191 --> 19:20.758
A kid?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.326
Why'd you steal
our smoker?

19:22.328 --> 19:24.262
Why'd you frame
Scotty Boom?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.197
'Cause he's my dad.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.766
I'm Tyler Boom.
Huh?

19:28.768 --> 19:31.969
My dad is so busy
shooting his TV shows

19:31.971 --> 19:33.871
and going to the openings
and closings

19:33.873 --> 19:35.873
of his restaurants...

19:35.875 --> 19:37.542
I never see him.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.443
You destroyed
your Dad's career

19:39.445 --> 19:41.646
so he'd spend
more time with you?

19:41.648 --> 19:43.447
Aw...

19:43.449 --> 19:44.982

<i>online.</i>

19:47.120 --> 19:49.654

<i>was coming to your town,</i>

19:55.061 --> 19:58.563
<i>and switched it so it looked</i>
<i>like my dad cheated.</i>

19:58.565 --> 20:00.998
This was the only way.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.401
The only way
I thought of.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.237
Son, why didn't you tell me
I was a terrible father?

20:06.239 --> 20:07.838
Because I'm from New York.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.307
We don't talk about
our feelings, huh?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.042
Yeah, I understand, son.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.410
I'm from New York, too.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.844
FDR Drive.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.080
The West Side Highway.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.415
Investment banking.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.050
The gallery scene.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.418
Knicks suck.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.053
(crying):
Oh, Papa!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.854
They suck so hard!

20:23.856 --> 20:25.423
One more thing, Tyler.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.258
Where's the Hive?

20:27.260 --> 20:28.559
(gasping)

20:29.728 --> 20:31.329
Oh...

20:34.600 --> 20:36.234
(sizzling)

20:36.236 --> 20:39.170
You're always so much hotter
than I think you're gonna be.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.406
Thanks, guys, for not giving up,
then giving up,

20:42.408 --> 20:47.111
then not giving up again,
then I forget.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.846
BBQ is like family--

20:48.848 --> 20:51.449
the cheap cuts of meat
that nobody wants.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.883
But if you treat them right,

20:52.885 --> 20:55.720
they turn into
the best thing in the world.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.922
Yeah, barbecue's yummy.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.124
Chinese is pretty good, too.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.592
Meh, it depends
on the place.
