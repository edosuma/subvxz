00:02.003 --> 00:04.172
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.255 --> 00:06.466
- Buy you a drink?
- Please.

00:06.591 --> 00:08.885
I hope I can trust Roz. I want to.

00:08.968 --> 00:11.096
I have my people
infiltrating your facility.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.181
<i>They're not trying to cure Inhumans...</i>

00:13.264 --> 00:14.349
They're turning them.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.102
<i>They're giving Terrigen
to as many people as they can.</i>

00:19.312 --> 00:20.772
Handing out the contaminant
as the cure...

00:20.855 --> 00:22.440
- No, that's not what we...
- That's especially sinister.

00:22.524 --> 00:24.025
No, I get weekly reports from...

00:24.109 --> 00:25.151
From Malick.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.362
Thousands of years ago,

00:27.445 --> 00:29.280
an Inhuman was born on the Earth

00:29.364 --> 00:32.200
that was sent through the portal
to a distant planet.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.993
<i>HYDRA was founded
with the sole purpose</i>

00:34.119 --> 00:35.829
<i>of engineering its return.</i>

00:35.954 --> 00:38.415
I know you want revenge,
to cut the head off of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:38.498 --> 00:40.583
- I'll help you do that.
- And in return?

00:40.667 --> 00:44.003
You'll help me learn how
S.H.I.E.L.D. brought someone back.

01:00.812 --> 01:04.232
Two All-Americans from D.J.'s.
Extra bacon, double cheese.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.818
Is it me, or is every burger
that's named the All-American

01:06.943 --> 01:08.319
just really awful for you?

01:08.445 --> 01:09.988
Oh, don't be a hater, Phil.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.241
Half Moon Pub.

01:14.659 --> 01:16.411
Isn't that where we had our first drink?

01:16.494 --> 01:17.662
I go there a lot.

01:17.787 --> 01:19.497
Of course you do.

01:20.165 --> 01:22.751
Yeah, it's not like
it's a memento, or anything.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.127
Just matches. Got it.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.966
You know, Banks thinks I'm crazy

01:31.676 --> 01:32.927
to keep seeing you like this.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.179
Oh. Huh.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.597
You told Banks about us?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.474
Yeah, I tell Banks everything.

01:37.974 --> 01:40.852
Hmm. I didn't realise
you two were so chummy.

01:40.977 --> 01:43.772
Well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

01:43.855 --> 01:46.524
Even after sneaking two of your agents
into my workplace.

01:46.649 --> 01:49.861
Just to say it, technically,
I was right to do that.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.489
You are working for HYDRA. And also...

01:53.531 --> 01:55.200
I'm sorry.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.535
Any sensible girl
would swipe left in this moment.

01:57.619 --> 02:00.038
Honestly, don't know what that means.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.539
You're such a Luddite.

02:01.664 --> 02:03.374
You know I have a flying car, right?

02:03.458 --> 02:04.876
Uh, yeah, it's from the '60s.

02:22.560 --> 02:24.354
I'm glad we're finally having burgers.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.565
Me, too.

02:31.820 --> 02:34.239
So, your team find
anything new about Malick?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.824
Nothing we didn't already know.

02:35.907 --> 02:39.327
DC power player with his hand in
almost every government organisation.

02:39.410 --> 02:40.662
Yeah, including mine.

02:41.538 --> 02:42.747
Where he somehow managed

02:42.872 --> 02:45.083
to remove every Inhuman
you had in custody.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.251
Thank you.

02:46.835 --> 02:48.503
Wait, you think Malick's mobilising?

02:48.586 --> 02:49.921
Only question is why.

02:50.046 --> 02:51.256
Not sure.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.007
That's what I intend to find out.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.677
You're going back into the ATCU?

02:57.762 --> 02:59.764
I can't protect you on the inside.

03:01.516 --> 03:04.018
Thanks, Lancelot, but I'll be just fine.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.771
The ATCU, it's my turf.

03:06.855 --> 03:10.275
And as far as Malick's concerned,
I'm just clocking in another day at work.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.860
Still a dangerous play.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.945
Well, then that's a risk I have to take.

03:14.028 --> 03:17.031
I mean, look, it's my people
that Malick's been using as lab rats.

03:17.115 --> 03:19.951
And I'm the idiot who's been working
under HYDRA this entire time.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.870
Idiot's a little harsh.

03:23.955 --> 03:25.790
So what's the plan once you're in?

03:26.457 --> 03:27.792
Just another day.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.211
But I scheduled a meeting with Malick,
and that way...

03:38.303 --> 03:40.096
Roz? Rosalind?

03:42.724 --> 03:43.892
No, no.

03:43.975 --> 03:45.310
Oh, no.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.061
Stay with my voice. Stay with me, Roz.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.731
Listen, stay with the sound of my voice!
Look at me, right here.

03:49.814 --> 03:51.399
Roz, Roz, I need you to breathe!

03:51.482 --> 03:54.110
Please! Roz! Look at me. Breathe!

03:54.652 --> 03:57.155
Roz! Wait, please breathe.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.407
Please breathe.

03:59.490 --> 04:01.826
Please. Just stay with me.

04:43.201 --> 04:45.161
<i>Now you know
how it feels, Coulson.</i>

04:45.244 --> 04:47.288
<i>To watch someone you care for
bleed out right in front of you.</i>

04:47.372 --> 04:48.414
Ward?

04:49.332 --> 04:51.751
Got to admit, it still sounds funny
when you don't say "Agent" first.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.419
What did you do?

04:53.544 --> 04:55.713
Seems I just eliminated a leak
at the ATCU.

04:56.756 --> 04:59.759
You murdered Rosalind
to keep her from digging into Malick?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.052
<i>Come on, Coulson.</i>

05:01.177 --> 05:03.262
You really think
Rosalind was gonna stop Malick

05:03.388 --> 05:04.973
from opening another portal?

05:05.056 --> 05:07.392
He's opened one before,
I'm sure he'll do it again.

05:08.518 --> 05:09.560
No.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.523
This is personal.

05:13.606 --> 05:16.317
<i>S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps sending
its best agents to kill me.</i>

05:16.401 --> 05:18.111
<i>Thought I'd stop that
from happening again</i>

05:18.236 --> 05:20.905
<i>by taking out the guy
who keeps sending 'em.</i>

05:23.241 --> 05:24.450
You wanna take me out?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.285
Come and get me.
We'll settle this right now.

05:26.411 --> 05:29.956
I have people who take care of
that sort of thing for me now.

05:30.081 --> 05:32.750
No, I just wanted to hear the panic
in your voice before you died.

05:33.918 --> 05:34.961
This isn't over.

06:15.668 --> 06:16.753
Move out!

06:19.464 --> 06:20.465
Go!

06:59.337 --> 07:00.338
He's outside!

07:10.681 --> 07:11.724
Get down!

07:15.686 --> 07:16.979
Go, go, go.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.903
What about Ms Price?

07:25.988 --> 07:27.198
Just drive.

07:51.013 --> 07:52.056
Let him go.

08:00.356 --> 08:02.692
Coulson say anything
once you got him out of there?

08:02.775 --> 08:05.069
He just told me
to get the interrogation room ready.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.469
I'm so sorry, Phil.

09:12.303 --> 09:13.679
Whatever you need, just ask.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.431
We start at the beginning.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.391
How does Ward think?

09:17.475 --> 09:20.186
Is there any weakness
we haven't exploited yet?

09:20.311 --> 09:21.938
You really think
there's something we've missed?

09:22.021 --> 09:23.648
There's only one way to find out.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.399
I want each of
the original team members

09:25.483 --> 09:27.235
to tell me everything
they remember about Ward.

09:27.318 --> 09:31.030
Down to the smallest detail.
No matter how uncomfortable.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.538
Okay.

09:44.335 --> 09:45.544
When you two were sleeping together,

09:45.670 --> 09:48.339
did he ever confess
any personal details?

09:49.674 --> 09:51.175
We didn't do much talking.

09:52.009 --> 09:55.638
How was your relationship with Ward
after he saved your life?

09:55.721 --> 09:56.889
I was grateful.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.683
Just grateful?

10:00.476 --> 10:03.521
Once, I caught him alone in my bunk.
Like some sort of creeper.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.647
Was he stealing?

10:04.730 --> 10:05.815
Uh, no. I don't think so.

10:05.898 --> 10:10.695
But he was, um, just sitting there.
Staring at a picture of me and my mum.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.531
Ward appealed
because he was damaged.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.908
Did he ever open up
about what had hurt him?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.536
Like I said, not much talking.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.997
But whatever it was
seemed to drive him.

10:21.539 --> 10:24.166
Made him desperate for others
to think of him as some kind of hero.

10:24.250 --> 10:25.918
He and I, we were like brothers.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.545
At least that's what it felt like
at the time.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.005
Now I realise he was just using me.

10:29.088 --> 10:30.298
Using you for what?

10:30.381 --> 10:32.258
It's hard to describe, really,
but it was like...

10:32.383 --> 10:36.387
Like he was trying to replace something
that had gone missing.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.472
I was such a pathetic flirt.

10:38.556 --> 10:41.309
Always laughing at his jokes
and those ridiculous puns.

10:41.392 --> 10:42.685
You were attracted to him.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.854
Well, he did jump out of a plane
to save me.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.355
Ever think the feeling
might have been mutual?

10:46.439 --> 10:48.065
That's not what Ward needed from me.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.401
Besides, it was obvious
he fancied someone else.

10:52.403 --> 10:53.863
I don't know what to say.

11:00.411 --> 11:02.079
Then just answer the questions.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.249
Sure.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.835
But I doubt there's anything
you don't already know.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.463
I've heard all about
how Ward fell for you.

11:10.588 --> 11:12.923
Now explain to me how you fell for him.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.468
<i>I realise
this has got to be hard on you.</i>

11:15.593 --> 11:18.471
I just want to get the guy
who took Roz out.

11:18.596 --> 11:19.889
So do we.

11:19.972 --> 11:23.100
Which is why there are
a couple of people I need you to meet.

11:26.771 --> 11:28.439
There was just something about him.

11:29.774 --> 11:32.109
We both had these
messed-up childhoods.

11:32.234 --> 11:33.778
Made it easy to relate.

11:34.612 --> 11:38.366
Have you considered that all that
might have been an act to get close?

11:38.449 --> 11:41.202
That, maybe, he found a weakness
and exploited it?

11:41.285 --> 11:43.120
It wasn't an act.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.581
For whatever reason,
Ward never lied to me.

11:45.664 --> 11:49.710
He just hid parts of himself
that I wasn't ready to see yet.

11:49.794 --> 11:50.836
Yet?

11:52.088 --> 11:55.841
When you grow up like we did,
it impacts how you see the world.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.387
Everything is filtered
through a very specific lens.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.805
And Ward got that.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.975
It's why he thought
he could make me understand him.

12:05.101 --> 12:06.352
Was he right?

12:06.477 --> 12:07.895
Probably.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.773
After years of moving
from place to place,

12:10.856 --> 12:15.194
I totally get how easy it was for him to
be taken in by a powerful father figure.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.281
I even understand how Garrett
was able to draw him into HYDRA.

12:19.365 --> 12:21.742
It's not like I wasn't fooled
by my mom when she...

12:21.826 --> 12:23.494
Sounds like there's a lot
you're willing to forgive.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.788
I will never forgive him.

12:27.623 --> 12:31.127
He murdered Rosalind just to hurt you.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.670
He killed Koenig...

12:34.338 --> 12:37.007
He killed Koenig because of me.

12:38.050 --> 12:41.595
He knew once Koenig outed him
as HYDRA, he'd lose you.

12:41.679 --> 12:46.183
And the sad part is, that's when I
finally understood him for the first time.

12:46.684 --> 12:50.187
The reason Ward kills
isn't because he feels nothing.

12:51.147 --> 12:53.357
It's because he feels too much.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.988
Ward mentioned that
Malick's trying to open a portal.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.364
Does this look familiar?

13:00.865 --> 13:03.284
Yeah, that's Distant Star Pathfinder.

13:03.367 --> 13:07.746
It was the programme NASA was
in the middle of when Roz and I joined.

13:07.872 --> 13:09.832
We weren't privy to the details.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.041
You know where NASA was running it?

13:11.167 --> 13:12.418
They weren't.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.879
An independent contractor
proposed the project.

13:15.004 --> 13:16.589
Ran things out of a lab complex.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.049
Facility shut down years ago.

13:19.175 --> 13:20.593
May be worth looking anyway.

13:20.718 --> 13:23.762
Do we have to guess who it was that
funded this independent contractor?

13:23.888 --> 13:25.556
No, you don't.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.224
It was Gideon Malick.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.243
All hail the conquering hero.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.246
That was fast.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.332
Seems I just gave the go-ahead.

13:51.415 --> 13:54.418
Been a while since I took a shot
from that far out. Felt good.

13:54.543 --> 13:55.628
Yeah, I bet.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.505
Guess in all that excitement,

13:57.588 --> 14:00.382
you forgot about the part
where we need Phil Coulson alive.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.885
He made it out.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.220
By the skin of his teeth.

14:04.303 --> 14:08.974
What the hell were you thinking about
sending in your little Bones Brigade?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.477
I wanted to put Coulson
through his paces.

14:11.602 --> 14:14.730
Ah. This is not some game
you just leave to chance.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.900
Well, maybe not for you.
I was good either way.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.318
Right.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.779
'Cause if Coulson doesn't make it out,

14:21.904 --> 14:24.281
you get that closure
you've been searching for.

14:25.324 --> 14:28.661
Closure's not something
that I ever put much stock in.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.289
What I believe in

14:33.791 --> 14:35.167
is moving forward.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.254
Never looking back.

14:40.297 --> 14:44.885
These five stones were extracted
from the Monolith centuries ago.

14:44.969 --> 14:48.013
The idea was that
they should be divided up evenly

14:48.138 --> 14:50.224
among HYDRA's
most powerful leaders.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.685
Now you've got the full set,
thanks to me.

14:54.645 --> 14:55.854
You're missing the point.

14:56.981 --> 14:59.149
These stones are the key

14:59.275 --> 15:02.820
to everything that HYDRA's been
marching towards since it was formed.

15:02.945 --> 15:06.699
And now you're jeopardising all of that
for something as petty as closure?

15:06.824 --> 15:08.242
Don't worry.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.744
Everything will play out
exactly like we planned.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.997
How can you be so sure?

15:14.665 --> 15:17.042
'Cause I know Coulson
better than he knows himself.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.215
Sir, I just wanted to say...

15:24.550 --> 15:25.593
Sir!

15:25.676 --> 15:26.885
You were supposed to take Ward out.

15:27.011 --> 15:29.513
I sent you to do a job, you failed.
Now people are dead!

15:30.055 --> 15:31.515
You need to calm down.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.359
Ward should never have had
the chance to do what he did.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.029
No.

15:46.322 --> 15:47.406
She's right.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.451
I'm the one who picked Ward
for this team.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.370
Everything that happened since,
it's on me.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.542
Sir, I'd do anything
to have another shot at the bastard.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.547
Well, you better not miss this time.

16:06.050 --> 16:07.176
This time?

16:07.259 --> 16:10.429
I figured out a way to track down Ward,
but we got to go off-book.

16:11.555 --> 16:12.640
My speciality.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.725
I'm not sure taking Hunter
is really such a good idea.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.269
You're going, too, Agent Morse.
We need a pilot.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.607
What are you thinking?

16:21.732 --> 16:23.400
It's simple, Agent Mackenzie.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.943
To take Ward out,
I need to cross some lines

16:25.069 --> 16:27.363
the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
shouldn't cross.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.406
Well, maybe those lines
aren't meant to be crossed.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.450
Maybe not, but this is happening.

16:31.575 --> 16:32.660
Wait, you want me to fill in?

16:32.743 --> 16:35.204
As acting director, until it's finished.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.623
Why not put May in charge?

16:37.748 --> 16:39.124
After everything
that's happened with Andrew,

16:39.249 --> 16:40.334
she's not ready to lead.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.921
You're the only one I trust who
doesn't have an axe to grind with Ward.

16:44.755 --> 16:47.633
I was gonna check out the Distant Star
facility with Fitz and Simmons.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.759
They've already gone.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.261
I sent them and a team
with Agent Banks 20 minutes ago.

16:51.387 --> 16:52.680
Well, maybe I should go.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.140
This isn't a request. It's an order.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.268
I need you to step up
and do the damn job.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.938
Does this mean
you're gonna tell me your plan?

17:01.980 --> 17:03.482
Absolutely not.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.778
Go.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.545
Seems unlikely
anything portal-related is still here.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.172
Don't go jumping to conclusions
just yet.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.341
We may still find something
to help us bring back Will.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.301
We can't bring him back.

17:31.427 --> 17:34.096
Jemma, we've already
built the programme

17:34.179 --> 17:36.181
to determine where
the portal will open on Maveth.

17:36.306 --> 17:38.100
The only thing that's left
is getting to the other side.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.852
That's not what I meant.

17:39.977 --> 17:42.271
It's irresponsible of us
to open another portal.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.982
HYDRA's been searching for the thing
on that planet for centuries.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.901
It's just an old wives' tale
HYDRA mums tell their goblin babies.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.236
But I've seen it! It's real!

17:49.319 --> 17:52.406
Yes, and so is Will, and he's
stuck there and he needs our help.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.077
You don't think I want to save him?

17:57.161 --> 18:00.956
That it's not tearing me up inside?
He saved my life, and...

18:01.498 --> 18:03.083
You know how I feel about him.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.504
But to put so many other lives
in jeopardy would be selfish.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.006
It's not selfish...

18:16.847 --> 18:17.973
Don't do this.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.768
It's not me.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.786
Let's go. Mr Malick is waiting.

18:48.045 --> 18:49.296
Our target's in a public place.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.715
Plenty of lookie-loos then, I imagine.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.634
You serious about all options
being on the table?

18:53.717 --> 18:55.135
You got something particular in mind?

18:55.219 --> 18:56.804
You ever robbed a bank before?

18:56.887 --> 18:58.889
Can't say that I have. Have you?

18:58.972 --> 19:02.059
Piece of advice. Never trust
a crooked jockey on a doped-up horse.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.145
My point is, I have an idea
I think should work.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.648
Good, 'cause time's a luxury
we don't have.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.691
Ward and Malick
are already 10 steps ahead.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.409
Don't blame me. This was his idea.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.081
Get 'em up.

19:26.708 --> 19:30.420
You know, my father used to say,
"Never send a boy to do a man's job."

19:30.504 --> 19:32.506
But it honestly never occurred to me

19:32.589 --> 19:34.716
that I should try sending
a young woman.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.220
Tell me, Ms Simmons,
when you went through, did you see it?

19:40.055 --> 19:42.683
You didn't tell me she was so feral.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.393
It's a new development.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.855
The secrets you must have hiding
in that pretty, little head of yours,

19:47.938 --> 19:49.022
just waiting to be shared.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.774
We're never gonna help you
open another bloody portal.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.192
Nobody's asking you to.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.362
You see, HYDRA's been opening
one portal or another for centuries.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.948
And all it takes is a few stones,

19:58.031 --> 20:01.034
and a building
with just the right vibrational frequency.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.619
What's all this about then?

20:04.413 --> 20:05.706
The other thing.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.959
They don't know how to get back.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.128
You really are a sharp cookie.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.880
Maybe now you're ready
to reveal the secret.

20:12.963 --> 20:14.798
Come a little closer and find out.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.800
What about you?

20:16.925 --> 20:17.968
Piss off.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.138
Any suggestions?

20:22.139 --> 20:23.432
Split 'em up.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.064
<i>HYDRA's taken
Fitz and Simmons.</i>

20:31.148 --> 20:32.482
How is that possible?

20:32.566 --> 20:34.902
There was an ambush
at the Distant Star facility.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.612
What about Banks and the others?

20:37.654 --> 20:38.739
They didn't make it.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.325
We gotta get on Zephyr One
and get there.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.743
I don't think that's the right move.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.328
They took Fitz and Simmons.

20:44.453 --> 20:46.246
I know that,
but HYDRA's long gone by now,

20:46.330 --> 20:48.999
and we can't waste every resource
we have chasing our own damn tail.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.792
It's better than doing nothing.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.296
I need to call Coulson.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.184
- Director.
<i>- Sir, we have a situation.</i>

21:07.267 --> 21:08.602
<i>Fitz and Simmons
have been kidnapped.</i>

21:08.685 --> 21:09.937
What? By who?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.605
<i>HYDRA, by the looks of it.</i>

21:11.688 --> 21:12.940
<i>It seems they knew we were coming.</i>

21:13.023 --> 21:16.526
That's why Ward mentioned the portal.
He wanted us to go there.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.202
Does this mean
we need to make a change of plans?

21:26.036 --> 21:28.288
No. It means this better work.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.543
Anyone need explaining
what to do next?

21:37.047 --> 21:38.382
We got no heroes here today, mate.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.138
Oh, God. How'd you find me?

21:51.561 --> 21:53.063
I'm not afraid of you.

21:54.398 --> 21:55.649
Got to say,

21:55.732 --> 21:58.568
I am impressed with this whole
Furiosa vibe you got going on.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.153
Please, just shut up.

22:00.237 --> 22:03.573
And sure, being trapped in another
world might've had a lot to do with it,

22:03.657 --> 22:05.325
but I would like to think

22:05.409 --> 22:09.705
dropping you and Fitz 20,000 leagues
under the sea really got the ball rolling.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.499
You really are the king idiot.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.753
This can go a couple of different ways.

22:16.837 --> 22:17.879
Do your worst.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.339
You see, that's the problem right there.

22:19.423 --> 22:21.008
If you'd really gotten to know me,

22:21.091 --> 22:24.011
you'd know that I would never
do anything to hurt you, Jemma.

22:26.596 --> 22:29.850
But I can't say the same is true for him.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.692
Let me know if you change your mind.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.364
You wanna see a trick?

23:04.092 --> 23:06.553
What have you done with Simmons?

23:06.636 --> 23:08.972
Trust me, you really don't wanna know.

23:09.056 --> 23:10.557
I'll kill you...

23:10.640 --> 23:11.975
Psychopath.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.436
It seems you're still scared of me, Fitz.

23:15.062 --> 23:17.230
Don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.149
There's a much simpler way
to make you talk.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.651
Leave Simmons alone.

23:22.986 --> 23:25.238
See, first thought I had
when we met was,

23:25.322 --> 23:27.908
"Wow, this guy's
really carrying a torch."

23:27.991 --> 23:30.077
It was sweet, really.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.162
Not, uh, adult sweet.

23:32.245 --> 23:37.125
More like a cartoon puppy dog
with his heart beating outside its chest.

23:37.751 --> 23:38.835
Don't do this.

23:38.960 --> 23:42.172
I even told you to make a move
before it was too late.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.175
Guess what? Too late.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.178
Please.

23:50.138 --> 23:52.516
Just tell me how she came back,
and this all ends.

23:52.641 --> 23:53.850
Simple as that.

23:53.934 --> 23:54.976
No!

24:02.776 --> 24:05.028
No! No!

24:05.112 --> 24:08.323
Or we can just sit here and listen.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.203
You really think
he can lead us to Ward?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.538
What I realised about Ward is that

24:14.663 --> 24:18.125
every twisted thing he does is just
a misguided attempt to justify his past.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.004
But there's one thing in his past
he can never make right.

24:24.673 --> 24:26.716
What is this? Did my brother send you?

24:26.842 --> 24:29.553
Grant Ward?
Doesn't even know you're here, mate.

24:31.388 --> 24:33.181
But he's about to.

24:36.977 --> 24:39.646
I'm curious which is worse for you.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.982
Those moments
when Simmons screams,

24:42.065 --> 24:44.317
or is it the long pauses
when she doesn't?

24:57.747 --> 25:00.417
I wasn't expecting a call
from a dead woman's phone.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.335
I spent every second
since you murdered Rosalind

25:02.419 --> 25:04.546
trying to understand
just how your sick mind works.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.007
It shouldn't be that hard.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.508
We're not that different, you and me.

25:08.592 --> 25:10.844
<i>It's not like we operate
in different worlds, Coulson.</i>

25:10.927 --> 25:12.262
<i>We both got blood on our hands.</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:14.931
Big difference is I've never hurt anyone
for selfish reasons.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.600
That is, until now.

25:16.725 --> 25:17.851
What's that supposed to mean?

25:17.934 --> 25:19.436
<i>There's someone here
who'd like to say hello.</i>

25:19.519 --> 25:20.687
Take a look.

25:32.449 --> 25:34.910
I got two of yours,
so you take one of mine?

25:36.036 --> 25:39.206
Like I said, two sides, same coin.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.459
Only I doubt
you're willing to take it all the way.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.045
I thought you might say that
so I brought a friend along.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.971
If you lay a finger on Thomas...

26:00.310 --> 26:01.561
Hanging up?

26:02.270 --> 26:03.980
Are you sure
that was the right play, boss?

26:04.105 --> 26:06.233
I need Ward to know
that we've got the upper hand.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.611
Plus, it'll really piss him off.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.324
Here.

26:14.407 --> 26:15.659
Please, don't kill me.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.244
Nobody wants that.

26:17.327 --> 26:20.163
That's not very reassuring
when he's got a gun to your head.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.832
I hate to break it to you,
but your brother isn't a very nice guy.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.502
You're the one who just kidnapped me.
What's wrong with you people?

26:25.585 --> 26:27.087
Ward hurt someone I care about.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.672
And as far as we can tell,

26:28.755 --> 26:31.341
you're the only thing left in this world
that he cares about.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.677
Which means,
you're the only way I can draw him out.

26:35.262 --> 26:36.304
Okay.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.641
But you better finish him off
when you do.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.687
Honestly wasn't expecting that.

26:43.812 --> 26:45.355
That's what Grant's always done.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.440
Hurt people, then lie to himself about it.

26:47.524 --> 26:51.278
So all that talk about a traumatic
childhood is just rubbish then?

26:51.361 --> 26:53.697
I'm sure whatever he told you
about our parents is true.

26:53.822 --> 26:57.284
See, my dad,
he had some real anger issues.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.202
And my mom, well, she had dad issues.

26:59.286 --> 27:02.205
So they spent most of their time
taking those issues out on us.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.874
What about your brothers?
Were you close?

27:04.958 --> 27:08.962
Christian was a lot older, so we
never really hung out much, but Grant...

27:12.215 --> 27:13.967
He was my best friend.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.554
Protected me from Mom and Dad.
From Christian.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.723
Then one day, he didn't.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.641
The day he pushed you down the well.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.978
Grant totally changed after that.

27:25.061 --> 27:27.063
It was like he felt guilty,

27:27.188 --> 27:29.149
but couldn't admit
what had really happened.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.985
Instead, he kept promising
never to let anyone hurt me again.

27:32.068 --> 27:35.071
Slightly unnerving coming from the guy
who just chucked you down a well.

27:35.155 --> 27:36.239
You two keep in touch?

27:36.364 --> 27:38.408
Family reunions, holidays,
that sort of thing?

27:38.491 --> 27:40.660
Grant was 17 when he burned
my parents' house down

27:40.744 --> 27:42.495
with Christian inside.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.498
Ever since, I've made sure
to give him a pretty wide berth.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.334
Pretty sound logic, actually.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.754
Well, you don't really seem
like your brother.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.256
Just 'cause you grow up
in a family of abusive monsters,

27:53.381 --> 27:55.842
doesn't mean you have to become one.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.510
I didn't.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.763
Please, don't hand me over to Grant.

27:59.846 --> 28:03.266
Sorry, mate. Giving you up
is the only way to draw him out.

28:04.225 --> 28:05.435
Maybe not.

28:05.518 --> 28:07.771
During the call
I put a trace on Ward's phone.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.440
Now we just have to keep him on
long enough to get an exact location.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.108
Ward will never let that happen.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.778
He will if I'm on the other end.
Let me talk to him.

28:14.903 --> 28:17.197
Not a good idea, even if he does...

28:17.280 --> 28:18.406
Call back.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.701
Still not a good idea.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.630
I swear I'll cut Fitz
from head to toe if...

28:33.713 --> 28:34.798
<i>Grant?</i>

28:36.758 --> 28:37.884
Thomas?

28:38.968 --> 28:39.969
You okay?

28:40.637 --> 28:42.138
Is everything they're saying true?

28:42.263 --> 28:45.225
<i>Don't listen to them.
They're the bad guys.</i>

28:45.308 --> 28:47.310
They killed someone I loved very much.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.561
Then why is this happening?

28:48.645 --> 28:51.648
<i>They know how much I care about you.
They wanna hurt me.</i>

28:53.733 --> 28:55.819
It's been almost 15 years.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.239
I tried to see you,
Mom and Dad made that impossible.

28:59.322 --> 29:00.490
They kept you hidden.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.118
<i>That wasn't Mom and Dad.
That was me.</i>

29:03.660 --> 29:06.496
<i>I changed my name and moved
so you'd never find me.</i>

29:06.579 --> 29:07.580
Why would you do that?

29:07.664 --> 29:10.333
<i>'Cause I didn't wanna
let you hurt me again.</i>

29:10.417 --> 29:11.668
That was one time.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.920
Really? One time?

29:14.003 --> 29:16.172
Then explain what the hell you did
to Mom and Dad.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.841
<i>- Thomas...</i>
- No, you killed them!

29:17.966 --> 29:19.175
And Christian, too.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.845
<i>You know what type of people
they were. They hurt us both.</i>

29:21.928 --> 29:23.096
<i>I couldn't let that happen again.</i>

29:23.179 --> 29:26.349
Dad needed a walker to get around.
Who was he gonna hurt?

29:26.433 --> 29:28.184
I know this is tough to hear,

29:28.268 --> 29:30.520
but sometimes you got to do
a bad thing for the right reason.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.440
Stop trying to justify what you did.
Just stop.

29:33.523 --> 29:34.858
You know, they were my parents, too.

29:35.024 --> 29:38.778
And, yeah, they were horrible people,
but you are so much worse.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.196
You set them on fire.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.949
<i>Thomas, calm down.
Listen to me for a second.</i>

29:43.032 --> 29:44.033
Time's up.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.286
Put Thomas back on the phone.

29:46.369 --> 29:47.620
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.123
You traced the call.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.666
And now I'm coming to put you down.

30:05.221 --> 30:08.725
You will tell me
everything I need to know, right now.

30:11.561 --> 30:12.979
You understand me?

30:13.855 --> 30:15.190
Do you?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.902
No!

30:25.158 --> 30:27.327
Trace puts Ward
in the southwest of England.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.078
They're at the castle
where we brought Simmons back.

30:29.162 --> 30:30.914
Which would explain
why he kidnapped her and Fitz.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.415
Because Malick's trying
to open another portal.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.083
Best get there
before that happens then.

30:34.167 --> 30:37.837
I spent my life staying off Grant's radar.
How am I supposed to stay safe now?

30:37.921 --> 30:40.173
A security detail's been assigned
to keep an eye on you.

30:43.593 --> 30:46.554
Was that all an act,
or was he really gonna hurt me?

30:47.764 --> 30:49.015
We'll be in touch.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.036
Daisy said you needed a word.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.205
More like your opinion.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.707
I've been reading
Andrew's file on Lincoln.

31:14.791 --> 31:18.044
"A dangerous temperament that's
only been inflamed by recent events.

31:18.127 --> 31:19.379
"It's my professional opinion

31:19.462 --> 31:21.714
"he should not be allowed
in the proposed initiative."

31:22.340 --> 31:23.758
What do you think?

31:27.804 --> 31:29.931
I'm not even sure
if that's Andrew's evaluation.

31:30.014 --> 31:33.017
Maybe it's Lash. How are we
supposed to know the difference?

31:35.979 --> 31:37.730
That's a live sat feed
from the castle

31:37.814 --> 31:41.067
where Ward and Malick
are holding Fitz-Simmons.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.236
Looks like HYDRA has
a couple of dozen troops.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.321
The bigger problem
is the heavy artillery,

31:45.405 --> 31:46.614
the surface-to-air missiles.

31:47.407 --> 31:48.950
And that's not even the worst of it.

31:50.326 --> 31:52.078
Coulson told 'em he was coming.

31:52.161 --> 31:55.123
Cloaking won't help
if HYDRA knows what to look for.

31:55.206 --> 31:58.209
I asked him if he needed backup,
but Coulson refused to make the call.

31:58.835 --> 32:00.962
You're the man in charge.
Make it for him.

32:07.260 --> 32:09.429
We're outmanned. Outgunned.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.763
With no time to mount an assault

32:10.847 --> 32:13.266
with even a snowball's chance
against a fortified HYDRA.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.688
What the hell am I supposed to do?

32:18.771 --> 32:20.773
I think you already know.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.915
Well,
there's our little space traveller.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.542
We were just about to
open up the portal.

32:39.626 --> 32:42.128
I thought you might wanna come
and see for yourself.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.428
Anyone who goes to that planet will die.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.513
That thing on the other side
drives people mad.

32:53.348 --> 32:56.059
Well, that's certainly
an interesting theory. Here's another.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.519
It wants to come back.

32:58.603 --> 32:59.979
And after all these years,

33:00.063 --> 33:01.814
we finally found someone
to help us do that.

33:01.898 --> 33:05.276
I'll never help you bring that thing back.
No matter how much you hurt me.

33:05.360 --> 33:08.363
Which is why we've agreed
to stop hurting you.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.157
So that he'd go instead.

33:14.452 --> 33:15.495
Oh, Fitz.

33:16.579 --> 33:17.747
Sorry, Jemma.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.291
I always thought
Fitz would give up the world for you.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.460
Looks like
now he finally has his chance.

33:29.217 --> 33:30.593
Are you sure about this?

33:30.677 --> 33:32.345
They haven't even been cleared
for field duty yet.

33:32.428 --> 33:34.013
I cleared them. Just now.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.685
Seems I might just get my team after all.

33:39.519 --> 33:40.895
Listen up.

33:40.978 --> 33:43.147
HYDRA has Fitz and Simmons,

33:43.231 --> 33:45.983
and they're planning
to open another portal.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.652
Which is why we're going to stop them.

33:48.319 --> 33:50.154
Yeah, but why us?

33:50.238 --> 33:51.781
I'm guessing we're all they've got.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.742
You two have powers
my other agents don't.

33:55.493 --> 33:58.663
But I'm not gonna lie to you,
this is a dangerous mission.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.289
And the odds are not in our favour.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.709
Not really a selling point.

34:02.792 --> 34:03.876
Here's the deal.

34:04.794 --> 34:08.005
What HYDRA's planning
is gonna hurt a lot of innocent people.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.841
Maybe people you care about.

34:09.924 --> 34:13.177
I wouldn't be asking you for your help
if I didn't think we had a chance.

34:13.261 --> 34:16.681
So, either you step up
and do the damn job,

34:16.764 --> 34:18.641
or you let the bad guys win.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.268
The choice is yours.

34:35.408 --> 34:37.034
Nice speech, Director.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.581
How long till we reach
HYDRA airspace?

34:42.665 --> 34:43.875
We're about 10 minutes out.

34:44.667 --> 34:45.710
Sir?

34:46.543 --> 34:47.754
About what happened back there...

34:49.005 --> 34:51.090
We got what we needed. End of story.

34:51.174 --> 34:52.632
I understand.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.594
But that look on your face?

34:54.677 --> 34:55.928
I've seen it before.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.848
It's the same look Hunter had
when he went after Ward.

34:58.931 --> 35:00.224
Not sure I'm getting your point.

35:00.308 --> 35:03.478
It's dangerous going into
a mission that emotional.

35:03.561 --> 35:05.813
You need to be able to separate the job
from your own feelings.

35:05.897 --> 35:06.939
You're wrong.

35:07.023 --> 35:09.108
I've been keeping my feelings in check
and look what it got us.

35:10.067 --> 35:13.029
Rosalind's dead.
Ward has Fitz and Simmons.

35:13.112 --> 35:16.032
My only regret is that I didn't kill that
son of a bitch when I had the chance.

35:16.115 --> 35:18.159
- Coulson...
- Let me know when we're close.

35:26.250 --> 35:27.335
It's time.

35:27.418 --> 35:29.420
Start without me.

35:29.504 --> 35:31.172
I need to get ready
for when S.H.I.E.L.D. arrives.

35:31.255 --> 35:32.799
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s not getting near here.

35:33.925 --> 35:35.051
Don't underestimate Coulson.

35:35.134 --> 35:37.845
Phil Coulson is of no consequence.

35:37.929 --> 35:41.724
You, on the other hand,
still have an important role to play.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.476
What are you talking about?

35:43.559 --> 35:46.646
I want you to lead our men
on the other side.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.023
You can't be serious.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.777
I've been working for this moment
ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. murdered Kara.

35:52.860 --> 35:53.945
Why would I give that up?

35:54.028 --> 35:57.281
Because you've already won.
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s finished.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.158
Do you really need to take a victory lap?

35:59.242 --> 36:00.827
This isn't over

36:00.910 --> 36:03.079
until I'm standing
over Coulson's dead body.

36:04.539 --> 36:07.917
I thought you were more than this.
More than bloodthirsty and vindictive.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.794
I thought you had vision.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.005
Vision enough to know
when I'm being manipulated

36:14.173 --> 36:16.676
into risking my life
for someone else's pipe dream.

36:16.759 --> 36:19.512
Your dream? Revenge?

36:19.595 --> 36:22.139
That's just vanity, Mr Ward.
That's a weakness.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.850
Don't talk to me
about weakness, old man.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.562
Weakness is following others blindly.
I learned that the hard way.

36:27.645 --> 36:30.815
I'm not asking you to follow,
I'm asking you to lead!

36:34.527 --> 36:37.989
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time, yes.

36:38.072 --> 36:42.285
But I had hoped
that I'd find someone to seize it with me.

36:42.368 --> 36:45.955
I thought it might be Pierce,
but he was bloodthirsty.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.707
I thought it might be John Garrett.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.168
But his vanity led him
to think of nothing but himself.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.046
John Garrett is the only reason
I put my faith in HYDRA.

36:54.130 --> 36:57.550
And that is the greatest thing
he ever achieved for our cause.

36:59.635 --> 37:03.139
I'm no soldier.
You're the finest we ever made.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.308
You're the only one that can do this.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.560
And if you cross over to that other side,

37:07.643 --> 37:12.023
you will finally see that your faith
in HYDRA was never misplaced.

37:12.106 --> 37:13.649
It's real.

37:14.859 --> 37:16.611
You will look it in the eye.

37:18.529 --> 37:19.572
And then?

37:19.739 --> 37:21.616
And then,

37:23.409 --> 37:26.370
we'll be able to do
whatever the hell we want.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.713
Hey. You touch her and the deal's off.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.425
Fitz, you can't do this.

37:39.508 --> 37:40.968
My mind's made up, Jemma.

37:41.052 --> 37:43.596
No, we can't let them
bring that thing back to this planet.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.099
Fitz?

37:47.183 --> 37:48.601
Please, just let them kill me.

37:48.684 --> 37:51.312
I can't do that. I won't.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.566
I lost you once.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.070
I can't lose you again.

38:00.279 --> 38:01.614
I'm just...

38:03.115 --> 38:06.619
I'm not strong enough to live in a world
that doesn't have you in it.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.001
Oh, come back to me.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.507
Just don't bring that thing with you.

38:21.968 --> 38:24.804
Only thing I'm gonna bring back
is Will, okay?

38:27.264 --> 38:28.975
Let's get this show on the road.

38:32.186 --> 38:33.437
What are you doing?

38:36.941 --> 38:38.067
Leading.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.721
Looks like they're getting ready.

39:06.804 --> 39:08.681
They're gonna take Fitz or Simmons.

39:08.764 --> 39:10.266
It's the smart play.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.434
Whatever they want over there,

39:11.517 --> 39:14.895
they'll take one to guide the team back,
keep the other one here for insurance.

39:14.979 --> 39:16.063
That's Ward.

39:16.147 --> 39:18.024
You can't seriously know that
from a bloody heat signature.

39:18.107 --> 39:19.483
It's him.

39:19.984 --> 39:21.110
Wait for me.

39:22.278 --> 39:24.488
Once you get down there,
you establish a perimeter,

39:24.572 --> 39:26.407
wait for me, I'm right behind you.
Get on in.

39:31.829 --> 39:34.582
Find it, get to the exit coordinates.

39:34.665 --> 39:38.794
We'll turn the portal back on
in exactly 12 hours.

39:38.878 --> 39:40.254
Got it.

39:41.005 --> 39:42.465
Bring it back, my friend.

39:42.548 --> 39:44.550
Be the one that finishes
what HYDRA started.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.887
You're making history today.

39:52.475 --> 39:53.684
Cheer up.

39:54.477 --> 39:56.270
A new beginning for both of us.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.494
He's going through.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.496
If that really is Ward,
then we're too late.

40:17.917 --> 40:20.503
Can you please go
talk some sense into him?

40:23.089 --> 40:24.215
You can't do this.

40:24.298 --> 40:26.258
Only a complete lunatic
would go down there without a plan.

40:26.342 --> 40:27.885
I'm ending this.

40:29.095 --> 40:30.304
Oh, bloody hell.

40:30.387 --> 40:32.348
Wait, wait. What the hell are you doing?

40:32.431 --> 40:34.892
We both know common sense
was never really my strong suit.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.984
