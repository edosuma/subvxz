WEBVTT

00:15.015 --> 00:17.351
- Here.
- Alright, hold on to here, alright?

00:17.434 --> 00:20.437
Everyone? Students,
gather your things and be on your way.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.648
- Class is dismissed for today.
- Oh, dear.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.817
- I need you to stay still.
- Let's get you home.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.903
Don't apply too much pressure.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.678
I'm sorry. Cole, I'm so, so sorry.

00:55.264 --> 00:59.393
Everything I care about... is gone.

01:01.270 --> 01:04.355
No sculpting, no school...

01:08.694 --> 01:09.695
I don't...

01:10.279 --> 01:13.407
I don't think there's a place
for me here...

01:15.576 --> 01:20.205
I don't think there's any place for me
in this world.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.923
It's not what the world holds for you,
it is what you bring to it.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.427
And you bring so much.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.766
We'll figure it out.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.310
Alright?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.937
We will.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.735
And I never like
to be the bearer of bad news,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.820
but I had to make the sacrifice.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.199
I saw what I saw,
and you needed to know.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.534
This is a lot to digest.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.872
- I'll have to speak with my husband.
- I'm sure he's not to blame.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.957
Miss Stacy is unbridled.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.626
This we know.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.629
Oh. Speak of the devil.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.521
Billy!

03:07.604 --> 03:10.440
Oh, my word! What happened?!

03:30.168 --> 03:31.670
Did you find Cole?

03:33.088 --> 03:34.881
He must be as shattered as...

03:36.091 --> 03:39.428
Nothing will ever be the same.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.697
Hey.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.041
- Watch your fingers.
- You watch them.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.752
You're the one with the hammer.

04:14.129 --> 04:16.173
There. Good.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.048
What's next?

04:18.132 --> 04:21.052
You sure you don't mind?
I got quite the list.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.681
There's a lot need fixing around here
for a long time now.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.309
You can take advantage of me.
I don't mind.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.148
Maybe you'll reduce the rate of my room
so I could stay another night.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.861
They're gonna wonder
what's become of me at the laundry.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.821
I haven't missed a day in six years.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.323
Let 'em wonder.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.408
What's next?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.746
The chimney's been smoking
something awful.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.998
I'll take a look
if you'll put up some coffee.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.354
Ah!

05:41.216 --> 05:43.093
If we ever have a story club again,

05:43.176 --> 05:46.221
I shall write the most tragical tale
about all of this.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.390
Coming, Anne?

05:48.473 --> 05:50.350
I'm going to stay for a little while.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.394
I'm hoping to see my fox.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.385
I'm so sorry, Anne.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.178
So very, very sorry.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.722
This is all my fault.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.432
- I ruined things...
- I wanted you to like me,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.684
- and was selfish about Cole!
- I should never have gone to his house.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.311
- I ruined everything.
- I was trying to help.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.813
If I could take it all back,
I would.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.783
Do you know if...

06:49.451 --> 06:50.910
Will Cole be punished?

06:51.411 --> 06:54.414
It's clear Billy's actions
precipitated the incident.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.959
I, on the other hand, am on probation.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.128
- Probation?
- Yes.

07:00.211 --> 07:04.341
In addition to my suspect teaching methods
and lack of control over the classroom...

07:04.424 --> 07:06.760
That had nothing to do with you.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.639
Apparently "home wrecker"
has been added to the list of infractions.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.642
I... don't understand.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.185
Neither do I.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.439
People think what they want to,
despite the truth.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.860
I figure the writing's on the wall.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.528
What do you mean?

07:27.197 --> 07:28.698
I expect to be let go.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.080
In any case, until they decide my fate,
I won't be teaching.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.809
She's going to be so happy.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.111
- Anne?
- She fell.

08:11.783 --> 08:12.951
Oh.

08:13.034 --> 08:13.994
Anne?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.831
Are you alright?

08:17.914 --> 08:21.001
Thank you, Matthew, thank you...

08:21.084 --> 08:23.128
Oh, oh.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.922
There... there now.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.425
Come on. Everything's alright.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.844
No! Nothing is!

08:32.011 --> 08:34.054
What's happened? What's wrong?

08:41.145 --> 08:42.522
There, there.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.160
I don't know what I'm doing here
anymore, Dad.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.916
What am I supposed to want?

09:03.168 --> 09:04.753
I wish you were here.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.966
How am I supposed to do all this
by myself?!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.672
My word.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.509
I'm about to be late for work.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.846
I guess the girls won't complain.
At least I'm going in today.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.933
I'll walk you. I want to investigate,

10:00.016 --> 10:03.228
see what's around here for work. Allow me.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.944
You vying for a prize or something?

10:13.029 --> 10:14.739
Just trying to earn my keep.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.117
What makes you think
I'm going to keep you?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.830
What I want to know is how it is that
someone didn't snap you up and marry you.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.834
We should go.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.551
Not much to it, I'm afraid.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.179
You must find it underwhelming
after everywhere you've been -

10:38.263 --> 10:40.390
the exotic ports of call.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.559
This place ain't no worse than some.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.771
But why choose this if you've got options?
You want a better life.

10:46.855 --> 10:49.482
- I do.
- You could go anywhere.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.276
I could.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.280
The Bog ain't nothin' but hardship.
Nothin' but trouble.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.282
But you're here.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.578
Trouble.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.919
Look at this beauty.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.048
- Tells me a story of hope in this place.
- I suppose so.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.675
Comfort, anyway.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.684
I should go. See you later, then?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.770
I'll get fixings for supper.

12:30.959 --> 12:34.879
Lower-school children
will practice their cursive,

12:34.963 --> 12:38.257
beginning with the letter A.

12:39.175 --> 12:43.554
Upper-school children
should read chapter... nine.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.058
But we already read that chapter
when Mr. Phillips was here.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.227
Repetition is the key to learning.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.479
Now hold your tongue.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.399
I will brook no further disruption
in this classroom.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.532
Ah!

13:02.615 --> 13:03.700
Wait until you hear!

13:03.783 --> 13:06.536
If you could refrain from scaring
the life out of me,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.287
I might be better able to converse.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.999
There's going to be a town-hall meeting
tomorrow night!

13:11.082 --> 13:13.251
We're holding a vote
on removing Miss Stacy.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.129
- Time for that trollop to go.
- Trollop?

13:16.754 --> 13:20.008
- That's a nasty thing to say, Rachel.
- It's true enough, that's what.

13:20.091 --> 13:23.553
She went riding with Harmon Andrews,
just as pretty as you please.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.681
For heaven's sake, you don't know
if there was impropriety.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.726
She's a spinster
in her childbearing years!

13:29.809 --> 13:30.727
Heaven forfend.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.730
An attractive woman
gallivanting with a married man!

13:33.813 --> 13:35.940
No one has you beat for hearsay.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.067
I saw it with my own eyes.

13:38.151 --> 13:41.112
And you'd better believe I went straight
to his wife to tell her, too.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.366
Miss Stacy assigned Anne an essay
on the perils of gossip.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.869
I daresay you could benefit
from the same lesson.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.746
I shouldn't expect you
to understand anything

13:49.829 --> 13:51.497
about perilous threats to husbands.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.958
Of course not.
What would an old maid like me know?

13:54.042 --> 13:56.836
I won't apologize
for having a powerful opinion!

13:56.919 --> 13:59.464
How about for having
a powerful prejudice?!

14:00.256 --> 14:02.967
Prejudice? You insult me.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.844
Well, I believe it's my turn.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.764
My opinion
is that your perspective is limited

14:07.847 --> 14:09.557
because you haven't lived a full life!

14:09.640 --> 14:12.435
So without a husband I may as well
be considered an invalid?

14:12.518 --> 14:14.687
If you stepped outside your own door
once in a while,

14:14.771 --> 14:16.981
you'd know better what was going on
right under your nose.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.858
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Without me,

14:18.941 --> 14:20.985
you'd never know a thing
that's going on in Avonlea.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.988
All tucked away in your little coffin
here at Green Gables.

14:24.072 --> 14:27.742
You sure love to stop by my coffin
unannounced and uninvited!

14:28.368 --> 14:31.621
I have put up with your judgments
and-and assumptions...

14:31.704 --> 14:32.997
I'm "put up with," am I?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.792
Your gossip and-and your bullying
for 50 years!

14:35.875 --> 14:36.793
Bullying?!

14:36.876 --> 14:39.545
I never did take you to task
for the way you spoke to Anne

14:39.629 --> 14:41.631
- the first day you met her!
- She was being impertinent!

14:41.714 --> 14:45.218
You were unkind!
Just as you're being now!

14:46.886 --> 14:47.720
Well!

14:47.804 --> 14:51.015
I think perhaps you're in a coffin
of your own - a mental one.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.892
You're close-minded, Rachel!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.895
You know what I am?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.564
I am... leaving!

14:58.648 --> 14:59.816
Fine by me.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.819
I'll ask permission via letter
before I visit again.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.612
<i>If</i> I ever visit again!

15:04.695 --> 15:07.115
Well, be sure to close the casket
on your way out!

15:12.745 --> 15:15.456
There has to be something we can do
to save Miss Stacy.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.750
If this was a story,
what would the hero do?

15:17.834 --> 15:20.670
But we're not heroes, Anne,
we're just girls.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.464
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I'm not ridiculous.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.800
A hero is a person,
and that person can be <i>any</i> person.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.844
All I meant
was that there's nothing we can do!

15:27.927 --> 15:29.220
The hero accepts
the call to adventure.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.181
So we have to convince the town
to accept Miss Stacy and let her stay.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.599
Not now, Moody.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.893
The town hall meeting
is tomorrow night.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.396
Next to trying and winning,
the best thing is trying and failing.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.022
Either way, I say we try.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.774
Whatever you're planning, I want to help.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.194
Everything went wrong
after I dropped the light bulb.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.907
I've got it.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.368
I know what we're going to do!
Huddle up.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.831
Here's what has to happen tomorrow.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.263
You cannot let the narrow thinking
of others chart your path.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.226
You're packing?!

16:18.978 --> 16:20.188
Come in.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.530
Believe me, if I could stay, I would,

16:29.614 --> 16:32.158
but... the tide has turned against me.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.994
Well, I happen to know
a young, redheaded girl

16:35.077 --> 16:37.747
who had a lot to offer this community

16:37.830 --> 16:41.250
but was judged and blamed and tormented,
too.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.294
Was it that difficult for Anne?

16:43.377 --> 16:47.715
Folks said all kinds of things against her
and thought the worst.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.967
But she never gave up on herself.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.974
Well... I-I'd best be off.
I'll see you at the town hall meeting.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.601
I wasn't invited.

17:00.770 --> 17:05.733
A strong woman I'm acquainted with
once said adversity can be a blessing.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.039
- Cole.
- What?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.374
Cole's here.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.547
- He's got a lot of nerve.
- I'll handle it.

17:33.511 --> 17:34.679
What do you want, freak?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.183
I wanted to apologize.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.606
I'm... sorry for my actions.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.068
Sorry about... what happened.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.947
That's not the kind of person
I ever want to be.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.538
Anyway, I just wanted to say that.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.418
Great. Good.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.296
Now you should get the hell outta here.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
Hey, Billy?

18:15.261 --> 18:18.139
You might wanna think about why you like
to destroy things that aren't yours.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.390
I don't have to think.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.603
Yeah. That's clear.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.825
I think you and me
should spend our lives together.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.370
No. Tsk. If you feel about me
the way I feel about you,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.873
then will you marry me, Mary?
That's no good at all!

18:46.208 --> 18:47.752
Ah...

18:48.628 --> 18:50.546
I missed you so much.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.258
I can't tell you how worried I was
when you didn't come home.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.344
I love you, sweetheart,

18:56.886 --> 18:58.137
I love you.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.394
Bash?

19:10.191 --> 19:11.776
Bash!

19:13.527 --> 19:14.779
Who the hell is that?

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
Yah! Yah!

20:05.538 --> 20:07.415
Whoo!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.376
Alright. Everybody ready?!

20:10.459 --> 20:13.546
- Yes?
- I can't tell if I'm scared or excited.

20:13.629 --> 20:17.174
- We're going to get in so much trouble.
- What's our battle cry?

20:17.258 --> 20:19.051
- No idea.
- What?

20:19.844 --> 20:21.011
Save Miss Stacy.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.223
Save Miss Stacy!

20:48.247 --> 20:49.915
Get in. We're going to Charlottetown.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.250
- Now?
- Yes.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.918
- Why?
- I'll tell you on the way.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.004
You're coming with us.
You need to see Miss Barry.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.381
She'll have some advice for you,
I'm sure of it.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.800
- You're driving there?
- We're taking the train.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.845
- I... don't have any money.
- Neither do we.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.723
- Then how...
- It's a caper. It'll be fine.

21:05.806 --> 21:09.351
- I'm already in enough trouble.
- So how much worse could it get?

21:14.482 --> 21:16.150
All aboard!

21:19.028 --> 21:20.112
Yeah.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.838
- We're hopping a freight car?!
- I can't breathe.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.423
We're all going to die.

21:39.507 --> 21:42.843
It'll be fine. People do it all the time.
I read about it in a book.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.970
- Mm-hmm.
- A book? Y-you've never done it?!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.640
How hard could it be?

21:49.475 --> 21:52.311
Just... gotta get the timing right.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.313
I'll go first.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.484
- It'll be fine.
- Hey, we shouldn't...

21:58.567 --> 21:59.735
Anne!

22:06.492 --> 22:09.245
- Now, Ruby.
- No! No.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.996
No...!

22:13.332 --> 22:15.543
- Come on, Ruby.
- Be careful.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.676
Got it? Alright.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.429
- Come on. Come on.
- Go on.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.765
- Oof!
- Oh!

22:32.268 --> 22:33.394
Come on, guys. Hurry.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.021
Come on, come on. Let's go.
Go get Moody!

22:37.147 --> 22:39.775
Come on. Oh! Oh!

22:49.702 --> 22:51.620
- Oh!
- We did it!

23:14.393 --> 23:16.145
What?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.063
What are you doing here?

23:18.147 --> 23:20.608
I figure I should ask you
the same question.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.401
I hope you find Sebastian.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.737
I hope he'll forgive me
for being so selfish.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.405
I'm sure you can make things right.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.449
As someone who's used
to putting their foot in it,

23:28.532 --> 23:30.743
I can tell you an apology
can go a long way.

23:30.826 --> 23:34.163
Oh, yeah. Well, good luck
with your mission to save Miss Stacy.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.916
- I can't believe you hopped a freight.
- Me neither.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.544
- See you on the other side of the war.
- See you.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.755
You know Gilbert has a crush on you,
right?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.757
What?! No, he doesn't.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.759
See you at the afternoon train.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.845
Say hello to Aunt Jo for me!
And it's not true!

23:51.055 --> 23:52.973
- What's not true?
- Nothing.

23:53.057 --> 23:55.142
Cole was just being ridiculous.
Let's go.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.305
I know you.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.431
Hello again.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.602
What's all this, then?

24:39.978 --> 24:41.647
Let's talk numbers.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.569
Gilbert? Have you seen Bash?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.530
I was hoping he was here.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.699
He was, but...

24:55.202 --> 24:58.747
...and he saw my son and ran off
before I could explain.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.334
I never told Bash I had a child,
let alone a grown one.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.253
May I ask why not?

25:04.753 --> 25:06.714
Because she's ashamed of me.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.425
Gilbert, this is my son, Elijah.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.593
Oh. Elijah. Pleasure.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.226
I'm not ashamed of you.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.603
Except when you run with the wrong crowd
like you've been doing.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.897
You wanna speak this now?

25:23.981 --> 25:25.107
I'm going.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.192
- You just got here.
- I got business.

25:27.276 --> 25:31.530
Can't get no peace here no how,
you frettin' all night over some man.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.366
Business.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.747
He's bootlegging.
I hate this place sometimes.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.959
Is that why you didn't tell Bash?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.379
I didn't tell him because...

25:48.297 --> 25:52.593
...I was worried that he would think
less of me if he knew I'd...

25:54.636 --> 25:56.555
...had a child out of wedlock.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.640
That's the truth of it.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.186
You must've been a baby yourself.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.980
Sorry if that sounded forward.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.400
It wasn't my choice,
but folks like to judge.

26:09.026 --> 26:11.069
Bash would understand.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.322
I know he would.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.325
You have any idea
where he might've gone?

26:16.408 --> 26:20.412
He barely knows the Bog.
I went looking for him last night, but...

26:20.496 --> 26:22.998
- It was freezing last night.
- It was.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.501
Poor Sebastian, he hates the cold.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.668
Yeah.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.421
He hates the cold.

26:32.633 --> 26:33.842
Oh!

26:33.926 --> 26:36.637
Does anyone else feel
as triumphant as I do?!

26:36.720 --> 26:38.514
Oh, my...

26:38.597 --> 26:40.349
- Moody!
- Oh! Oh, no.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.017
- Moody, are you alright?
- Yes.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.520
Are you sure? No, no, no, no...

27:00.702 --> 27:03.956
- Have you seen Sebastian?
- Gimme my five bucks back.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.624
We didn't want to turn him out,

27:05.707 --> 27:08.293
but we didn't want
to scare off the customers neither.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.753
- He's here?
- Mm-hmm.

27:09.837 --> 27:10.838
Where?

27:14.883 --> 27:17.052
Drunk as a skunk.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.637
Oh, Sebastian!

27:18.720 --> 27:20.639
Hey, Bash, wake up.

27:20.722 --> 27:23.308
Wake up. Bash.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.900
Mary, honey, you don't want
to get mixed up with the likes of him.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.777
- I do.
- He's a drunkard.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.989
I'm not a drunkard.
I'm heartbroken.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.577
It's not what you thought.

27:42.286 --> 27:44.663
That man you saw was Mary's son.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.291
Her son?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.044
Your son?

27:54.882 --> 27:56.508
Does that mean you can marry me?

27:58.886 --> 28:01.555
Marry you?

28:15.527 --> 28:18.238
- What're you doing here, Blythe?
- Oh.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.908
I guess I have a wedding gift for you.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.660
This is the deed to the farm.

28:23.744 --> 28:26.914
I'd like you to sign onto it,
because you're my partner.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.207
My family.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.211
I want you to have a stake
in the land, fair and square.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.506
We're in this together.

28:37.466 --> 28:40.510
We are. And, hey, I'm sorry.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.221
I'm not changing the plan.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.067
Hmm.

28:55.651 --> 28:57.486
How did the madcap caper go?

28:58.737 --> 29:02.741
My, my, this is a dreadful turn of events.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.409
What are you going to do?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.370
I might be out of ideas.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.289
But you're never out of ideas!

29:09.623 --> 29:10.999
Ahem.

29:12.125 --> 29:14.336
It's all my fault. Again.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.673
- It was an accident.
- My whole life's an accident.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.177
Rollings, do we have any ladders?

29:39.194 --> 29:42.322
I'm giving you children train fare
to get home.

29:42.406 --> 29:45.075
You've had enough adventure for one day.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.202
- Thank you, Aunt Josephine.
- Mm-hmm.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.163
You won't tell Mother and Father
about all this, will you?

29:50.247 --> 29:54.584
And reduce your opportunities
for other enriching adventures?

29:54.668 --> 29:56.420
Never.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.883
Cole's going through so much.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.845
Were you able to comfort him?

30:05.345 --> 30:09.141
He knows I understand him...
and support him.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.439
I know I... disappointed you.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.149
At your soiree.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.945
I got the impression
that I'd disappointed you.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.948
No, it's just... at the time,

30:25.032 --> 30:27.659
I didn't know how much I didn't know.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.786
And now?

30:31.621 --> 30:32.831
I'm sorry.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.667
My thinking was narrow.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.837
I understand so much more now.

30:38.920 --> 30:43.050
Oh. Life is short and the world is wide,
dear heart.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.683
All aboard!

30:53.352 --> 30:54.478
Go, go.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.857
- Here, I can take that.
- Thank you.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.485
Cole! Hurry, you'll miss it.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.947
- Hurry! What are you doing?
- I'm not going back.

31:08.492 --> 31:09.618
What?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.497
Aunt Jo said I could live with her.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.376
But your family...

31:18.335 --> 31:19.294
I know.

31:20.504 --> 31:23.507
But I can be free here - myself!

31:27.219 --> 31:29.221
I need to be who I am.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.640
All aboard!

31:33.892 --> 31:35.102
I'll miss you.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.732
All aboard! Final call!

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
Go. Go.

31:48.448 --> 31:51.326
It'll be fine. This is good.

32:14.182 --> 32:18.186
Therefore, we are of
the opinion that Miss Stacy has proven

32:18.270 --> 32:20.689
that she is neither qualified

32:20.772 --> 32:24.067
nor an appropriate person
to shape the young minds of Avonlea.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.028
Thank you, Progressive Mothers.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.155
Thank you.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.866
Minister...

32:30.949 --> 32:33.952
please remind
our fine community

32:34.035 --> 32:36.496
what we should expect from a teacher.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.876
A teacher is expected...

32:40.959 --> 32:44.337
to enforce rules and keep order.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.591
They must teach obedience, faith,

32:47.674 --> 32:50.343
respect for elders, and morality.

32:50.427 --> 32:53.305
These are the tenets of education.

32:53.388 --> 32:57.142
Children should be silent, show respect,
be honest...

32:57.225 --> 33:01.021
- Careful.
- ...punctual, clean and tidy.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.190
- Watch your step.
- The goal of education

33:03.273 --> 33:05.734
is to create a better workforce,

33:05.817 --> 33:08.320
with an emphasis on good behaviour.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.072
And the ability to follow directions

33:11.156 --> 33:13.950
and utilize... memorization.

33:14.743 --> 33:18.914
There is no place
for nonsense games and activities.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.209
Memorization and recitation

33:22.292 --> 33:25.128
ensure proper education.

33:25.212 --> 33:28.757
- Like this.
- Understanding concepts,

33:28.840 --> 33:32.552
or ideas,
is not valuable in our goal...

33:47.025 --> 33:48.527
Miss Stacy!

33:49.236 --> 33:52.155
If you don't mind,
we're conducting a meeting!

33:52.239 --> 33:54.950
I don't recall
your presence being requested!

33:55.033 --> 33:57.869
Indeed, my presence was not requested,

33:57.953 --> 34:01.164
but I feel I have a right to speak
on my own behalf.

34:06.253 --> 34:07.879
Ahem.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.385
It would be easier on all of us if I left.

34:13.885 --> 34:17.429
You cannot imagine that I want
to cause dissent in your community,

34:17.514 --> 34:21.685
or that I appreciate being accused
of purposefully doing so.

34:23.812 --> 34:28.400
I'm here tonight because I asked myself
a question that I ask you now:

34:30.277 --> 34:35.072
What is the most important thing to focus
on regarding your children's education?

34:35.824 --> 34:38.702
Petty jealousy? Prejudice?

34:39.953 --> 34:40.954
Fear?

34:42.121 --> 34:45.625
The important question to ask yourself is:

34:45.708 --> 34:47.502
Are your children learning?

34:48.168 --> 34:50.005
I believe the answer is yes.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.505
We have to hurry.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.426
Change is uncomfortable,

34:54.509 --> 34:56.844
because the future's unknown.

34:57.554 --> 35:01.683
Yet the future is riding in fast,
like a train.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.769
And to the best of my ability,

35:04.853 --> 35:08.523
I am here to bring your children forward
to meet it.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.569
I understand my methods are unusual,

35:12.652 --> 35:15.030
but hands-on learning
and active engagement

35:15.113 --> 35:18.158
have proven more effective
than rote memorization.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.747
Why not encourage them
to think for themselves?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.333
Why teach only what has come before?

35:27.751 --> 35:31.212
Recently,
somebody dreamed the telegraph...

35:31.796 --> 35:34.466
...electricity, a steam engine.

35:35.467 --> 35:40.597
Not that long ago, I bet train travel
felt too fast, a dangerous innovation,

35:40.680 --> 35:43.266
but can you imagine your lives
without it now?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.686
Dreamers change the world.

35:46.770 --> 35:49.481
Curious minds propel us forward.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.693
My intention is to build strong students
with bright futures,

35:53.777 --> 35:56.363
not just for them, but for everyone.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.577
That is why I'm here.

36:33.692 --> 36:38.488
What you've just witnessed is the effect
of Miss Stacy's methods in action.

36:38.571 --> 36:41.116
She taught us about electricity,
but she also showed us

36:41.199 --> 36:46.204
the spirit of enthusiasm and curiosity
that we needed to make this happen.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.832
Miss Stacy is an inspiration.

36:48.915 --> 36:52.168
We learned more from her in a week
than we learned in a year.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.879
Tell me and I forget,

36:54.963 --> 36:57.966
teach me and I remember,

36:58.049 --> 37:00.552
involve me and I learn.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.972
Different isn't bad,

37:04.764 --> 37:06.433
it's just not the same.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.404
Ahem. There's always...

37:19.946 --> 37:21.030
another way...

37:22.031 --> 37:23.241
...to look at things.

37:28.288 --> 37:31.958
I returned to Avonlea because
I needed what has always been here.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.753
But why would I stay if I can't grow?

37:37.505 --> 37:41.885
Miss Stacy supports my ambition
to become a doctor.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.180
I believe that she is our chance
to help us realize our dreams

37:45.263 --> 37:47.891
and become more than we are now.

37:51.811 --> 37:56.357
As someone who lived without change
for the bulk of my life...

37:57.275 --> 38:00.612
...and then had great change
thrust upon me...

38:01.029 --> 38:05.283
...I can attest that it is the only way
to grow and learn.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.169
Let's put this to a vote.

38:21.466 --> 38:24.511
All in favour of keeping Miss Stacy?

38:26.304 --> 38:29.307
- Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Yes. Yes.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.069
We did it!

39:06.553 --> 39:09.848
Oh! Good morning, Miss Stacy!

39:09.931 --> 39:11.599
We're so excited to have you back!

39:25.238 --> 39:26.614
No letter?

39:27.490 --> 39:29.868
Just some flowers for my mental coffin.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.454
I'll put up some tea.

39:41.296 --> 39:43.256
Did you hear the news?

39:43.339 --> 39:45.049
We're taking a trip to Charlottetown.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.012
Have you a mind to tell me why?

39:49.596 --> 39:51.222
I do indeed.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.249
Can we visit Cole and Aunt Josephine
while we're in Charlottetown?

41:01.292 --> 41:03.127
I suppose we might.

41:03.211 --> 41:06.714
But may I remind you
that you are still under punishment

41:06.798 --> 41:08.675
for your little adventure.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.135
It was worth it.

41:11.219 --> 41:12.387
I agree.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.472
Go. Step up.

41:23.106 --> 41:26.818
I, Sebastian, take thee, Mary,

41:26.901 --> 41:28.903
to be my wedded wife,

41:28.987 --> 41:31.823
to have and to hold from this day forward,

41:31.906 --> 41:33.992
for better or for worse,

41:34.075 --> 41:36.202
for richer or for poorer,

41:36.285 --> 41:38.121
in sickness and in health...

41:38.997 --> 41:41.666
...to love and to cherish,

41:41.749 --> 41:44.252
till death us do part.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.510
And, Mary,

41:52.719 --> 41:56.055
wilt thou have this man
to be thy wedded husband,

41:56.139 --> 41:59.517
to have and to hold from this day forward,

41:59.600 --> 42:01.394
for better or for worse,

42:01.477 --> 42:03.396
for richer or for poorer,

42:03.479 --> 42:05.273
in sickness and in health,

42:05.356 --> 42:07.942
to love and to cherish,

42:08.026 --> 42:09.610
until death you do part?

42:12.739 --> 42:14.449
I will.

42:15.158 --> 42:19.162
I now proclaim Sebastian and Mary
husband and wife.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.291
It was a lovely service.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.378
It was... lovely.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.342
Remember when I said
that an apology can go a long way?

42:33.634 --> 42:36.179
For the short time
we have left in class together,

42:36.262 --> 42:38.139
I resolve to be less obnoxious.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.475
I'll be sticking around,
so you've got your work cut out...

42:40.558 --> 42:42.894
I'm really glad you found
your vocation. I found mine, too.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.687
- What? You go.
- What? You first.

42:45.897 --> 42:49.192
I'm gonna stay and work the farm
with Bash like we planned.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.235
College will wait its proper turn.

42:51.319 --> 42:54.572
So... you're not leaving school early?

42:55.740 --> 42:57.366
I want to be with my family.

43:01.204 --> 43:02.288
Your turn.

43:02.997 --> 43:06.501
I've decided I'm going to be a teacher,
just like Miss Stacy.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.670
Tragical romance and all?

43:10.546 --> 43:12.090
Remains to be seen.
