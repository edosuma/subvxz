00:05.006 --> 00:07.373
(Engine chugging,
debris clattering)

00:13.481 --> 00:15.047
Man (Over radio):
Hey, Dorfman, need some help.

00:17.585 --> 00:20.085
(Engine idling)

00:25.493 --> 00:27.292
Morning, Manny.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.361
What are you
so happy about, Dorfman?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.497
It's Monday morning.
Start of a new week.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.165
It's freezing out here.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.433
That's the best part.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.101
Hey, don't you notice
what's missing?

00:36.103 --> 00:37.469
(Inhales)
Huh? No smell.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.572
The air is crisp.
The garbage is frozen.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.375
Yeah, that's my problem.
So's the hopper's hydraulics.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.243
The trash
won't slide.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.279
No problemo.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.518
Here we go.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.289
So... give it
a little nudge.

00:57.291 --> 01:03.295
(Grunts)

01:03.297 --> 01:04.430
(Dorfman gasps)

01:06.133 --> 01:07.499
(Gasps)

01:10.371 --> 01:14.206
¶ ¶

01:40.301 --> 01:43.368
bishop:
<i> Dear president Truman...</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:45.370
<i> I mean "Harry."</i>

01:45.372 --> 01:47.473
<i> I mean "sir."</i>

01:47.475 --> 01:49.608
<i> I realize it's a little</i>
<i> unorthodox</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:51.443
<i> to write a dead president,</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:54.480
<i>but you were the 33rd president</i>
<i> of the United States,</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:58.317
<i> and founder</i>
<i> of the modern-day NSA.</i>

01:58.319 --> 02:00.819
<i> There aren't many people</i>
<i> I can talk to about this</i>

02:00.821 --> 02:03.889
<i>since Jake and I hit the skids,</i>

02:03.891 --> 02:06.859
<i> and I don't even</i>
<i> keep a journal myself,</i>

02:06.861 --> 02:10.329
<i> so... here goes.</i>

02:10.331 --> 02:13.432
<i> Mr. president,</i>
<i> the last couple of days</i>

02:13.434 --> 02:14.733
<i> really sucked.</i>

02:14.735 --> 02:16.468
<i> Not because it was cold--</i>

02:16.470 --> 02:18.537
<i> frostbite comes with</i>
<i> living in DC--</i>

02:18.539 --> 02:21.473
<i> but because it made me</i>
<i> reconsider</i>

02:21.475 --> 02:24.276
<i> every reason</i>
<i> I became a federal agent,</i>

02:24.278 --> 02:27.246
<i> both NSA and NCIS.</i>

02:27.248 --> 02:29.414
<i> (Sighs)</i>
<i> I mean, 2015 was rough,</i>

02:29.416 --> 02:31.917
<i>but in the last couple of days,</i>

02:31.919 --> 02:34.753
<i> it all came into perspective.</i>

02:34.755 --> 02:37.489
<i>Sir, did I mention it was cold?</i>

02:37.491 --> 02:40.425
Female TV reporter:
<i> Brace yourself, Metro area--</i>

02:40.427 --> 02:42.427
with the wind chill,
we are talking

02:42.429 --> 02:44.429
ten, 20 degrees below.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.864
And yesterday's rains

02:45.866 --> 02:48.400
are causing icy conditions,

02:48.402 --> 02:49.935
which are now
downing power lines

02:49.937 --> 02:52.571
across many areas.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.707
10,000 homes without power,
and that number

02:55.709 --> 02:57.409
is expected to rise.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.911
That number's rising,
all right.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.213
(Chuckles)
Good morning, nanook.

03:01.215 --> 03:04.283
Hey, are you wearing every
item of clothing you own?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.785
I am.
And I still can't get warm.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.389
Power in my block went out
last night, so no heat.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.491
Delilah bailed around midnight,

03:12.493 --> 03:13.759
went to her mother's.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.927
Why didn't you go with her?

03:14.929 --> 03:16.929
Well, because I couldn't.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.463
We're not married.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.499
I'm-I'm sorry-- seriously?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.868
Yes, seriously. Her mother's
got this thing about

03:22.870 --> 03:25.470
unmarried couples spending the
night together under her roof.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.939
My parents were the same.

03:26.941 --> 03:30.475
Tony, can I crash with you
tonight, please?

03:30.477 --> 03:31.643
Come again?

03:31.645 --> 03:32.945
If they can't fix the power,

03:32.947 --> 03:34.513
I can't go back to my place.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.615
You heard the weather lady--
i can't go back there

03:36.617 --> 03:39.218
if they don't have the power on.
Please.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.552
Why don't you...

03:40.554 --> 03:42.421
Stay in a hotel?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.855
(Chuckles)

03:43.857 --> 03:45.624
Let's see how the day goes.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.694
Oh, I could use
a little more coffee...

03:49.964 --> 03:51.597
Grab your gear.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.665
Got a call from
Virginia state police.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.867
Dead sailor in a landfill.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.971
Wait, a Virginia landfill?
Where, exactly, boss?

03:58.973 --> 04:00.739
Adams county.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.414
Hey, Timmy McGee!

04:09.416 --> 04:10.682
Stewie.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.921
Oh, boy.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.590
Hey, so, uh, you
found the body, huh?

04:18.592 --> 04:19.825
Yeah.

04:19.827 --> 04:22.628
Crazy, huh?
Looking right at me.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.263
McGee knows
the garbage man.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.931
They went to school together.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.332
Give me a hug.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.934
Oh, yeah.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.602
Oh.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.504
Grammar school?
M.I.T.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.506
Stewie got a degree
in evolutionary biology,

04:34.508 --> 04:36.842
but he's really into trash.

04:36.844 --> 04:40.479
Hey, bro. This is so cool,
seeing you guys again.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.682
I found a really great photo
of you from our senior year.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.851
Oh, yeah? What, uh, what of?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.420
There she is.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.623
(Chuckling):
Oh, stewie.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.292
Are those tap shoes?

04:53.294 --> 04:54.760
Yeah, they sure are.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.561
Still have 'em around somewhere.
Oh.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.597
Called ourselves
the mul-tap-liers.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.932
Multipliers, get it?

05:00.934 --> 05:02.567
(Chuckling):
Oh.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.369
We were good, too.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.305
Really? I mean,
you're not a little mortified,

05:06.307 --> 05:07.873
showing this photo?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.574
Why would I be?

05:09.576 --> 05:10.876
Dorfman: As a matter
of fact, we, uh,

05:10.878 --> 05:12.544
tapped our way
into quite a few

05:12.546 --> 05:13.745
theater girls'
hearts, didn't we?

05:13.747 --> 05:15.013
Yes, we did.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.581
Hey! Got a crime scene

05:16.583 --> 05:17.649
to process here!

05:17.651 --> 05:19.718
Uh, sorry.
On my way, boss.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.391
State police ran her prints.

05:26.393 --> 05:29.027
I.D.'D her as
seaman Alessandra ramos.

05:29.029 --> 05:32.531
She's stationed aboard
the<i> USS barkley</i> at Norfolk.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.399
What do you see, duck?

05:34.401 --> 05:36.735
A single gunshot wound
to the forehead.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.571
We won't know more
until she thaws out.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.606
Hopefully, this plastic

05:41.608 --> 05:43.608
will have shielded her body from

05:43.610 --> 05:45.677
contamination from
all this trash.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.878
(Car approaches)

05:55.356 --> 05:58.357
DC Metro.
Detective Jeff katz.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.658
You in charge here?

05:59.660 --> 06:02.794
Special agent Gibbs. NCIS.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.830
You're a little
out of your jurisdiction.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.064
Not really.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.599
Just heard
from Virginia state police

06:07.601 --> 06:09.368
your victim is
Alessandra ramos.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.737
You know her?

06:11.739 --> 06:13.739
She was due to testify
before a grand jury

06:13.741 --> 06:15.707
next week, in a murder case.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.743
Guess that's
not gonna happen now, huh?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.690
Seaman Alessandra ramos
is third-generation Navy.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.825
She enlisted right out of high
school in la mesa, California,

06:33.827 --> 06:35.594
just outside San Diego,

06:35.596 --> 06:37.929
where her father retired
as a chief petty officer.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.965
After she finished "a" school,
she served aboard

06:39.967 --> 06:41.800
the<i> barkley</i> as an e.T.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.969
Been at Norfolk
the past six months.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.071
Her Navy record's spotless.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.472
Alessandra
was a stand-up kid.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.474
I interviewed her
a couple of times.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.510
How'd you find her?
She called the hotline.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.612
She said she had information
on a gang shooting.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.781
Gang shooting?
We've got a turf war going

06:55.783 --> 06:57.682
in Columbia heights.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.751
She was on her way back
to Norfolk one night,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.586
stopped at a drive-through,
heard gunshots.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.588
She saw a guy
jump into a car and take off.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.724
It was dark but she knew
the make and the model

07:05.726 --> 07:06.925
and the last three numbers
of the plate.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.460
Caught the guy.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.461
Dominick rubin.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.762
A real piece of work.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.998
Her identity
wasn't kept confidential?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.733
We thought it was.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.834
We have got to find a lead

07:15.836 --> 07:17.602
on where she was murdered.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.038
Got two agents on their way
to Norfolk right now

07:20.040 --> 07:21.206
to talk to her shipmates.

07:22.743 --> 07:26.878
Woman:<i> I can't believe</i>
<i> Alessandra is dead.</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:28.780
Bishop: When was the last time
you saw her, seaman burk?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.749
Friday, after we finished work.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.951
Neither of us had weekend duty,

07:32.953 --> 07:35.754
so I was driving down
to see my parents in Atlanta

07:35.756 --> 07:38.757
and she was headed into DC.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.559
What was she gonna do there?

07:40.561 --> 07:41.893
This group she loved--

07:41.895 --> 07:43.728
the sterile puppets--

07:43.730 --> 07:45.497
they were doing a show
at a club--

07:45.499 --> 07:46.898
dacey's lounge.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.568
She was going alone?
Yeah.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.069
Took the train.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.738
So she went into DC a lot?

07:53.740 --> 07:55.841
Whenever she could.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.909
Aly loved the city.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.481
Have her parents been told?

08:02.483 --> 08:05.684
They must be devastated.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.819
You two were close.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.521
Yeah.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.490
Did she tell you
she was gonna testify

08:11.492 --> 08:13.792
before a grand jury
about a gang shooting?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.794
Is that why she was killed?

08:15.796 --> 08:18.797
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.666
Was she nervous
about testifying?

08:21.668 --> 08:24.603
Aly? Um...

08:24.605 --> 08:27.873
I was more worried
about it than she was.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.742
Military family.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.811
She was a total badass.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.917
Bishop:
<i> Mr. president, losing anyone</i>
<i> in uniform is difficult.</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:42.521
<i>We encounter it here too often.</i>

08:42.523 --> 08:45.724
<i> But this was a young woman,</i>
<i> a young sailor,</i>

08:45.726 --> 08:48.927
<i> who had her whole life ahead</i>
<i>of her and she wanted to serve.</i>

08:48.929 --> 08:51.196
<i> She wanted to help</i>
<i> put away a gang member.</i>

08:51.198 --> 08:54.099
<i> She wanted</i>
<i> to do the right thing.</i>

08:54.101 --> 08:56.067
<i> Based on everything</i>
<i> I was learning,</i>

08:56.069 --> 08:58.603
<i> ramos was someone</i>
<i> to be admired.</i>

08:58.605 --> 09:01.773
<i> There was more to this</i>
<i> than just a wrongful death.</i>

09:01.775 --> 09:03.942
<i> I-i had a hunch, sir.</i>

09:03.944 --> 09:05.610
<i> I knew it from day one</i>

09:05.612 --> 09:08.747
<i> and I should have</i>
<i> followed my instincts.</i>

09:30.671 --> 09:34.205
Put that back exactly
where you found it, Mr. Palmer.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.042
It-it... it just looked
so comfy and warm.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.277
Yes, well, it was a present
from my uncle Duncan.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.980
He wore it
on a mapping expedition

09:41.982 --> 09:45.216
to the antarctic,
in 1933.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.285
(Firmly): Go.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.756
You got something, duck?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.892
Yeah, well, the body's
almost up to temperature.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.995
Then we can get this bag off
and begin the autopsy.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.897
There are ligature marks

09:58.899 --> 10:01.666
on her wrists,
suggesting she was restrained.

10:01.668 --> 10:06.037
And she has abrasions and cuts
that are defensive wounds.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.607
This young lady put
up quite a fight.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.975
What about the gunshot wound?

10:09.977 --> 10:12.043
Well, I'll retrieve the bullet

10:12.045 --> 10:13.178
as soon as I can,

10:13.180 --> 10:16.047
but it's a small caliber.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.216
Rubin used a nine-millimeter
in the gang shooting.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.285
Bring him in.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.690
Detective katz.
What are you doing here?

10:25.692 --> 10:28.226
This is NCIS
special agent Gibbs.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.195
I'm confused.

10:30.197 --> 10:33.632
You having trouble
building a case against me?

10:33.634 --> 10:35.934
Do you need the Navy's help?

10:37.404 --> 10:39.104
Got some questions
for you, Dominick.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.172
You know I don't talk
without my lawyer.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.277
Call him.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.113
We'll wait.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.723
I'm intrigued.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.959
I'll listen.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.028
Why's the Navy involved?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.433
You know her?

11:08.435 --> 11:12.170
She's kind of cute.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.907
Always attracted
to a lady in uniform.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.712
Maybe that'll help you remember.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.982
Nope.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.685
Never seen her before.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.220
You gonna try
to pin this one on me, too?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.923
She was gonna testify
against you next week, place you

11:31.925 --> 11:33.158
at the scene of the crime.
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.226
I already told you
i wasn't there.

11:47.474 --> 11:51.042
I always respected
those who serve in the military.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.278
My kid brother serves.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.483
I had nothing to do with that.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.193
I don't know.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.828
He may have
killed your banger.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.302
But my gut tells me he had
nothing to do with seaman ramos.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.504
I think you're right.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.506
But we'll obviously
be keeping an eye on him,

12:21.508 --> 12:24.309
so let me know
if anything comes up.

12:24.311 --> 12:28.179
Space heaters were sold out
all over town.

12:28.181 --> 12:30.181
Plus, these windows--
they do absolutely nothing

12:30.183 --> 12:31.816
to keep out the cold.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.852
Plus, plus, you
work subterranean.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.121
Plus, plus, plus, heat rises.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.023
Another reason I should've moved
my lab when I had the chance.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.159
Hate to pull our attention
away from this bunsen burner,

12:41.161 --> 12:43.178
but you said you
had something?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.196
Uh, yeah, I have
several somethings.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.832
I found blonde hair
in seaman ramos's jacket.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.835
It can't be hers.
She's a brunette.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.138
Well, she was at a club
with a couple hundred

12:53.140 --> 12:54.873
other women,
so it makes sense.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.076
Yeah, but I found the hairs
inside the jacket,

12:58.078 --> 13:00.812
so maybe somebody else
was wearing her jacket?

13:00.814 --> 13:02.380
At least one of them had
a follicle on it

13:02.382 --> 13:04.149
so I could run DNA,

13:04.151 --> 13:06.117
and I got a hit.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.051
(Keyboarding rapidly)

13:07.053 --> 13:09.254
19-year-old college student

13:09.256 --> 13:11.122
Jane Murphy.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.059
Stay warm, Abby.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.429
What'd you find out?
Tony: We talked to several
people on the<i> barkley,</i>

13:18.431 --> 13:20.532
including a bunkmate who
confirmed that seaman ramos

13:20.534 --> 13:22.534
came to DC Friday night

13:22.536 --> 13:25.470
to go see a concert at dacey's
lounge. She was gonna stay

13:25.472 --> 13:27.972
at a motel, take the train
back the next morning.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.541
Lounge is closed today,

13:29.543 --> 13:31.276
but we spoke to the manager
at the motel.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.312
Ramos had a reservation
but never showed.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.947
Oh, hey.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.148
You're back.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.817
Hey.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.084
What'd Abby give you?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.085
Oh, well, she, uh, found
some hairs

13:41.087 --> 13:42.453
on seaman ramos's jacket

13:42.455 --> 13:45.256
that belonged to
a waverly university student

13:45.258 --> 13:46.324
named Jane Murphy.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.196
All right. Come on, McGee.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.330
You're with me.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.570
Man:
<i> That's all you got for me?</i>

13:58.572 --> 14:01.539
Can we at least go
into Jane's room one more time?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.575
Excuse me. Hi.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.276
NCIS. Special agents

14:05.278 --> 14:07.111
McGee and Gibbs.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.546
We're, uh, looking
for Jane Murphy.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.548
Federal agents?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.084
I'm her father.
Why are you looking for her?

14:13.086 --> 14:15.053
Do you know where she is?
No,

14:15.055 --> 14:17.422
damn it--
apparently nobody does.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.324
Since when?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.192
(Sighs) Friday.

14:21.194 --> 14:25.096
I drove down after she missed
her Sunday phone call.

14:25.098 --> 14:28.399
Do I need to file
a missing persons report?

14:28.401 --> 14:31.269
What the hell is going on?

14:40.647 --> 14:44.148
Our missing girl
is Jane Murphy, 19,

14:44.150 --> 14:47.285
a college junior last seen
leaving her dorm at about

14:47.287 --> 14:49.921
8:30 Friday night.
Tony: As to her destination,

14:49.923 --> 14:52.457
friends offer up a wide
variety of possibilities.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.960
An off-campus party,
an on-campus kickback,

14:55.962 --> 14:58.663
a sorority party,
another off-campus party.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.666
Her father gave her a credit
card to use for emergencies.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.035
I'm running it now.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.104
You still cold, McGee?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.071
Yeah.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.306
The heater is working.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.541
Tony's isn't.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.144
I crashed there last night.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.579
I was seeking refuge.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.681
Only to bring
your bad luck with you.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.150
Tree came crashing down,
took out this power line.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.986
It was after midnight.
It got very cold very fast.

15:21.988 --> 15:24.622
The good news is, if the power
doesn't come back tonight,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.458
bishop has very kindly said
that we can stay at her place.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.994
I have?
Yeah. We'll talk
about it later. Um,

15:29.996 --> 15:33.131
as for any obvious connections
between these two ladies--

15:33.133 --> 15:35.667
Jane and seaman ramos--
there are none.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.102
Other than the strands
of Jane's hair found in

15:38.104 --> 15:40.672
ramos's jacket, there's
nothing that links the two.

15:40.674 --> 15:42.073
What about
the gang leader, rubin?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.374
So far,

15:43.376 --> 15:46.344
I'm finding no link there
either... though rubin

15:46.346 --> 15:48.012
might have had motive
to kill ramos,

15:48.014 --> 15:49.414
there's nothing that suggests

15:49.416 --> 15:51.215
he was involved
in Jane's disappearance.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.285
Tony, who played that concert
ramos went to on Friday?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.521
Uh, sterile puppets.
Colony hill.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.057
Jane's credit card?

16:01.261 --> 16:03.461
There's a $30
admission fee to dacey's lounge.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.029
Go. Get down there.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.031
Me, too, Gibbs?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.967
(Phone rings)
No. Keep digging

16:08.969 --> 16:10.268
on our gangbanger.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.703
Yeah, duck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:11.705 --> 16:13.972
I'm on my way down.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.207
Jimmy:
It was nothing, doctor.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.209
You would have
found it eventually.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.044
But I didn't, Mr. Palmer.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.213
Credit where credit is due.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.182
Credit for what, duck?

16:24.184 --> 16:26.150
A keen eye, Jethro.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.986
Among her scratches
and abrasions,

16:27.988 --> 16:29.754
I misidentified an injury

16:29.756 --> 16:32.156
and Mr. Palmer
caught my error.

16:32.158 --> 16:35.193
Oh, come on.
It was hardly an error.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.095
Well, whatever you call it,
what is it?

16:37.097 --> 16:40.164
Well, what appeared to me to be
a rodent bite turned out to be

16:40.166 --> 16:42.633
a shallow gouge
with a sharp instrument.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.503
Something was carved
from beneath her epidermis.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.071
What kind of something?

16:47.073 --> 16:48.539
Something that
was successfully removed

16:48.541 --> 16:50.241
and no longer there.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.311
But I was able to swab
the area for residue,

16:53.313 --> 16:56.180
and I came up
with this.

16:56.182 --> 17:00.151
It's a... it's a super
tiny microfragment.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.386
I was just about to run it up
to Abby.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.388
That's a nice catch, Palmer.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.456
Credit where credit's due.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.326
Run!

17:09.162 --> 17:11.496
(Wry chuckle)

17:11.498 --> 17:14.365
Man: Oh, yeah.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.334
They were here. I'm sure.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.736
You remember them?
Listen, we get hundreds

17:18.738 --> 17:21.339
of hotties just like this
on any given Friday night,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.674
so it's a good bet
they were here.

17:23.676 --> 17:26.411
Okay, so is there
a bartender or doorman

17:26.413 --> 17:29.213
who might remember<i> them,</i>
specifically?

17:29.215 --> 17:31.082
My night crew won't be in
for a few hours,

17:31.084 --> 17:32.116
but you guys are welcome

17:32.118 --> 17:34.185
to stick around.
Actually,

17:34.187 --> 17:36.421
it's '90s night,
in case you guys want to relive

17:36.423 --> 17:38.689
some of your glory days later.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.724
Excuse me?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.426
Glory days?
Yeah.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.428
Show off some of those
old dance moves?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.762
A little "can't touch this."

17:44.764 --> 17:46.664
What's
your surveillance situation?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.166
Do you have security cameras?

17:48.168 --> 17:49.534
Of course I do.
State-of-the-art,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.169
front doors and back.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.170
Hub's in my office.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.238
Let's go have a look.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.841
Actually... what am I saying?

17:56.843 --> 18:00.445
It's sort of unclear, but I'm
looking forward to some clarity.

18:00.447 --> 18:03.181
Our backdoor cameras,
they've been out since Thursday.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.782
Thursday?
Yeah. Some yahoos
cut the wire.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.386
I'm still waiting
on the repair guy.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.821
Clever yahoos.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.790
Suspicious yahoos.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.360
Bishop:<i> Mr. president,</i>
<i>once you were quoted as saying,</i>

18:16.362 --> 18:18.362
<i> "America wasn't built on fear.</i>

18:18.364 --> 18:20.531
<i> "It was built on courage,</i>
<i> imagination,</i>

18:20.533 --> 18:23.468
<i> and unbeatable determination</i>
<i> to do the job."</i>

18:23.470 --> 18:26.471
<i> Well, I work with people now</i>

18:26.473 --> 18:29.874
<i> who have nothing but courage</i>
<i> and determination.</i>

18:29.876 --> 18:33.244
<i> But the case was affecting</i>
<i> our vision.</i>

18:33.246 --> 18:34.879
<i> Let me rephrase that.</i>

18:34.881 --> 18:36.614
<i> The case was affecting</i>

18:36.616 --> 18:37.882
my<i> vision.</i>

18:37.884 --> 18:39.484
<i> As an analyst,</i>

18:39.486 --> 18:41.786
<i> I should have seen things</i>
<i> more clearly.</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:44.222
<i> Now there were two women</i>
<i> missing,</i>

18:44.224 --> 18:46.457
<i> and the trail was still cold.</i>

18:46.459 --> 18:49.560
<i> Like everything else.</i>

18:49.562 --> 18:53.231
Dan the creepy '90s owner man
was right.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.465
We checked
those backdoor cameras,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.467
and the wires
had clearly been snipped.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.202
Likely for a reason.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.770
You check the back alley?
We did.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.240
And for a cheesy rock club,
it was surprisingly clean.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.642
I managed to
isolate both girls entering

19:04.644 --> 19:06.911
dacey's lounge
Friday night.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.913
(Tapping computer keys)
Jane Murphy at 9:36.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.416
And shortly thereafter,
seaman Alessandra ramos

19:12.418 --> 19:13.918
at 9:52.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.353
And exiting?
Well, no footage

19:15.355 --> 19:16.787
of either one, actually.
The last people

19:16.789 --> 19:18.356
to exit the club
through the front doors

19:18.358 --> 19:20.258
were the two bouncers,
and that was

19:20.260 --> 19:23.528
at 2:43 A.M.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.929
Tony: Only way our girls
could have left

19:24.931 --> 19:26.430
is through the back door.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.865
Likely against their will.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.334
Agent Gibbs, we got it.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.203
You got what?
That fragment we found

19:32.205 --> 19:33.371
was a micro GPS tracker.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.340
Abby's analyzing
it for more data,

19:36.342 --> 19:37.441
but she wanted me
to show you this.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.412
It's no bigger
than a vitamin capsule.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.880
It's-it's like one
of those rfid chips

19:42.882 --> 19:46.417
that shelters use
to identify cats and dogs,

19:46.419 --> 19:48.419
but<i> these</i> actually track
the animals

19:48.421 --> 19:49.453
that they're implanted in.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.355
Or in this case, seaman ramos.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.392
Jimmy, where on her body
did you find that chip?
Well, actually, I only...

19:54.394 --> 19:55.660
I only found a small piece
of it,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.328
but it was in a little hole
just under...

19:57.330 --> 19:58.462
Her armpit?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.199
Her left armpit?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.300
Yeah.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.534
How did you know that?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.969
Oh, man.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.370
What, bishop?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.439
We shut them down years ago.

20:08.441 --> 20:09.891
Who?

20:09.892 --> 20:11.342
It was a human trafficking ring.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.844
I-i was still new to the NSA,
three, four years ago.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.847
We were part of a joint
task force with the FBI.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.517
Since when does the NSA
do human trafficking?

20:19.519 --> 20:21.919
It was international.
College-age girls abducted,

20:21.921 --> 20:24.255
microchipped,
and sold to the highest bidders

20:24.257 --> 20:25.690
all over the world.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.758
You still in touch with anyone
from the task force?

20:27.760 --> 20:29.594
Uh, we all went
our separate ways.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.896
I can reach out to them,
see what they know.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.431
It's been a long time.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.399
Yeah, go. Go.
Palmer, go help Abby.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.034
Find out where those chips...

20:37.035 --> 20:38.668
...came from and
who bought 'em-- on it.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.773
Woman:
I almost dropped the phone
when you called, Ellie.

20:42.775 --> 20:46.344
The concubine case?
You really think it's them?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.346
I was hoping
you could tell me, Daisy.

20:48.348 --> 20:51.983
(Sighs) Any chance FBI caught
any similar cases recently?

20:51.985 --> 20:53.417
(Scoffs) Hope not.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.986
Let me check with
the criminal division.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.988
I transferred over
to counterintelligence

20:56.990 --> 20:59.523
after we put
concubine away... or...

20:59.525 --> 21:01.525
That is, after I thought
we put them away.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.661
Did you get ahold
of your NSA buddy, Connors?

21:03.663 --> 21:07.665
Former NSA. He retired not long
after we closed the case.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.401
And I plan
on staying that way.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.869
Adam. Hey.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.704
Oh.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.939
Thanks for coming.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.374
Of course. Agent milner.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.508
Good to see you.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.876
Wow.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.512
Look at this former nerd.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.713
Never would've pegged you
for the type, Ellie.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.715
The type?

21:24.717 --> 21:27.351
You know, trade in
your stats and your snacks

21:27.353 --> 21:28.719
for a badge and a gun.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.988
Eh, I saw that
coming years ago.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.623
Could always tell you had
an itch for more action

21:32.625 --> 21:34.425
than the NSA offered.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.427
An itch I surely lacked.

21:36.429 --> 21:39.363
After we shut down concubine,
all I wanted was less action,

21:39.365 --> 21:42.700
not more.
"Shut down" now being
a loose term.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.935
Not for me. I'm still in denial.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.704
Come on, Ellie, for
years now, I've been

21:46.706 --> 21:48.606
so proud of going out
on a high note,

21:48.608 --> 21:50.474
after a big win.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.710
Couldn't this be some
other trafficking ring?

21:52.712 --> 21:54.078
There have got to be hundreds.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.946
With the exact same m.O.?

21:55.948 --> 21:57.548
College-age girls,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.450
taken in the U.S.,
tracking chip

21:59.452 --> 22:01.352
just under their armpit?

22:01.354 --> 22:03.554
Left armpit?

22:04.590 --> 22:05.823
(Sighs)

22:05.825 --> 22:07.925
So much for our happy reunion.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.728
So, Ellie,
what do you need from us?

22:10.730 --> 22:13.331
Uh, maybe come back to NCIS,

22:13.333 --> 22:15.766
compare notes
from our old case?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.468
I'm in.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.803
Adam?

22:18.805 --> 22:20.805
I don't know.
Just talking about it's

22:20.807 --> 22:22.440
got my ulcer kicking again.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.442
I'm just a numbers guy.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.445
No, you were<i> the</i> numbers guy
who followed the money trail

22:27.447 --> 22:28.913
and led us straight to them.

22:28.915 --> 22:31.515
He's also retired.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.951
I don't know about your
bosses, Ellie, but mine
won't go for sharing intel

22:33.953 --> 22:36.487
with a civilian.
No offense, Adam.

22:36.489 --> 22:40.124
None taken. But I'll still go
through my final report

22:40.126 --> 22:41.726
and see what I can dig up.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.728
Can't imagine
I'd be much help anyway.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.497
I do people's taxes now,
on spreadsheets.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.832
Well...

22:47.834 --> 22:50.601
(Sighs) ...Anything
you think could help.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.002
Oh, man.

22:52.004 --> 22:54.405
What is it?
Criminal division?

22:54.407 --> 22:56.407
FBI's currently juggling
six new cases

22:56.409 --> 22:58.442
of missing college-age girls
in the last two months.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.678
All along the
eastern seaboard.
Six?

23:00.680 --> 23:03.981
Rain check, Adam. These girls
could be shipped off any minute.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.828
So it is now eight
women missing between

23:17.830 --> 23:20.598
the Philadelphia, New York, and
DC Metro areas, including Murphy

23:20.600 --> 23:22.099
and ramos.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.601
We're hoping
the other seven are alive.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.503
How'd the others
go missing?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.905
Uh, according
to our FBI criminal division,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.074
circumstances of their
disappearances were all similar.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.176
Bishop: Each was at a bar,
a concert, a nightclub,

23:32.178 --> 23:35.579
got separated from their
friends, never made it home.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.416
That's like your old case?
We called it concubine,

23:38.418 --> 23:40.785
since that's basically all
these women were sold for.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.788
Kidnapped, microchipped,
a little stockholming.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.023
"Cooperate or we'll kill
your whole family"--

23:46.025 --> 23:48.692
that sort of thing.
They wouldn't hesitate
to kill one girl

23:48.694 --> 23:51.128
in order to scare the others.
Anyone who fought back.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.964
Just like seaman ramos
must have.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.166
So how did they smuggle
these girls

23:55.168 --> 23:56.901
out of the country undetected?

23:56.903 --> 23:58.102
Any means necessary.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.037
Everything was funded
by the buyers,

24:00.039 --> 24:02.606
so money was no object.
Private jets,

24:02.608 --> 24:04.809
(phone rings)
Commercial freighters...

24:04.811 --> 24:07.211
Yeah, Abbs. I'll be right down.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.613
How'd you catch 'em?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.515
Ultimately, it was NSA.

24:12.785 --> 24:13.818
Nothing new in the playbook.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.486
We just followed the money.

24:15.488 --> 24:18.022
Think I'll go back to my office
and pull our old files.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.890
Start following that money
again, see where that leads.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.492
Keep us in the loop.

24:21.494 --> 24:22.827
I could go with her, Gibbs.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.465
Bishop:
<i> Mr. president,</i>

24:27.467 --> 24:29.800
<i>it was remembering these girls,</i>

24:29.802 --> 24:32.803
<i> remembering the awful things</i>

24:32.805 --> 24:36.240
<i> these traffickers were capable</i>
<i> of that left me asking,</i>

24:36.242 --> 24:38.809
<i> how do we keep going?</i>

24:38.811 --> 24:41.579
<i> How do we put away one,</i>

24:41.581 --> 24:46.250
<i> knowing there are 50 more</i>
<i> waiting to be caught?</i>

24:46.252 --> 24:50.154
<i> Sir, I know why I became</i>
<i> a federal agent:</i>

24:50.156 --> 24:51.922
<i> To help.</i>

24:51.924 --> 24:55.559
<i> But what if my help</i>
<i> isn't good enough?</i>

24:55.561 --> 24:58.596
Abby: When I was examining
the chip fragment found in

24:58.598 --> 24:59.230
seaman ramos's armpit,

24:59.232 --> 25:02.566
I discovered this.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.570
These are serial and
batch numbers.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.138
Tony:
What's "dti"?

25:08.140 --> 25:11.175
Well, in the same way
that programmers and hackers

25:11.177 --> 25:14.678
will often hide their signatures
in binary code,

25:14.680 --> 25:18.282
most new technology companies
will tag the end of their

25:18.284 --> 25:20.651
serial number
with their company initials.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.652
Dti...

25:21.654 --> 25:23.554
Daly tech industries.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.222
You know them?
Yeah. We were looking

25:25.224 --> 25:27.992
into these chips for Delilah's
sister when she got a new dog.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.827
Well, they're based out of DC.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.196
And it's a new start-up,
so they're probably

25:32.198 --> 25:35.566
still small enough to
be able to track whoever

25:35.568 --> 25:37.835
specifically bought
this chip.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.136
Cool. You got an address?

25:42.575 --> 25:43.574
Stay warm.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.109
You, too.

25:46.312 --> 25:47.912
Tony:
<i> You sure you called ahead?</i>

25:47.914 --> 25:51.682
I did.
Well, then maybe
we should call again.

25:51.684 --> 25:52.917
This place is empty.

25:52.919 --> 25:56.186
Oh... hello.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.556
Female voice:
Welcome to daly tech industries.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.324
And the future.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.127
That is so cool.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.962
(Chuckles)
You know, I got a robot

26:04.964 --> 26:06.764
for Christmas in 1985.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.632
The thing never worked.

26:08.634 --> 26:09.767
I hate the future.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.269
With whom do we have
the pleasure?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.971
Oh.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.641
Hi. Uh, I'm very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.277
This is my partner,
special agent Tim McGee.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.879
We're looking for...

26:21.881 --> 26:24.682
Me. Right behind you.
Tiffany.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.817
I run daly tech's
pet GPS division.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.252
And pretty much
everything else.

26:28.254 --> 26:29.653
I'm sorry I wasn't
here to meet you.

26:29.655 --> 26:32.022
I was on a call with
a potential investor.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.791
Kickstarter can only take you
so far these days.

26:33.793 --> 26:37.127
Did you bring the fragment with
the serial and batch numbers?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.963
Uh, yes, I did.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.599
So, we were hoping,
Tiffany, that you could...

26:41.601 --> 26:43.133
Trace this
to a particular buyer.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.602
Good guess.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.804
You're cops.
This is evidence. Duh.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.039
You're in luck.
This is one of

26:49.041 --> 26:51.342
the last lots we used before
we switched to silicon cases.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.377
Let me look up the batch.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.149
So you started the company
on kickstarter, huh?

26:59.151 --> 27:02.152
No. I started it
when my German Shepard ran away.

27:02.154 --> 27:05.222
And got hit by a car.
Did you know that over

27:05.224 --> 27:07.858
six million dogs and cats were
killed on U.S. roads last year?

27:07.860 --> 27:09.893
That's a fun fact.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.395
Got a match.
Oh, good.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.063
But I can't tell
you who it is.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.765
Why not?

27:14.767 --> 27:16.233
Because you don't have
a warrant.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.268
This is private
information.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.837
I know the legal system thinks

27:19.839 --> 27:21.372
of animals as property,
but I don't.

27:21.374 --> 27:22.906
Whatever dog this came out of

27:22.908 --> 27:25.075
has the same rights
as you and me.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.644
It didn't come out of a dog.

27:26.646 --> 27:28.245
It came out of a person.

27:29.415 --> 27:32.416
Your product is being used
in human trafficking.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.685
Oh, my goodness.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.256
This piece came
from a bulk shipment

27:39.258 --> 27:41.659
to a company called
vanderhusen industries.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.228
All I have listed for them
is a p.O. Box number.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.335
Do you still think this is
connected to your old case?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.205
I do.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.841
(Sighs)
Last time, the girls were just

27:57.843 --> 28:00.911
names and photos
on my computer screen.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.682
I guess I just wanted to see...

28:04.684 --> 28:07.217
(Sighs heavily)

28:07.219 --> 28:10.454
I don't know
what I wanted to see.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.090
Ellie, it goes
without saying, but...

28:15.294 --> 28:17.695
...this kind of stuff--

28:17.697 --> 28:20.164
it affects me a lot more
since becoming a father.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.733
I'm sure it does.

28:22.735 --> 28:25.436
I mean, with this kind of
evil in the world...

28:25.438 --> 28:27.938
(Voice breaking):
People who will do this kind...

28:31.444 --> 28:35.145
How am I ever supposed to let
Victoria leave the house?

28:35.147 --> 28:37.147
Pretty sure she'll leave
the house eventually,

28:37.149 --> 28:38.916
whether you let her or not.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.884
(Phone ringing)

28:45.124 --> 28:47.491
Hey, Daisy. What's up?

28:47.493 --> 28:49.460
Plenty. I called Adam.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.428
Can you meet us back at
your diner in, say, 20 minutes?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.330
I'll be there.
What do you got?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.399
I don't know yet,
but I think I'm real close.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.135
Following the money is
definitely the way to go.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.904
Excellent. Uh, I will grab
Gibbs, and we'll see you there.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.843
(Sighing):
I gotta go, Jimmy.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.044
Yeah. Yeah.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.182
Bishop?

29:16.455 --> 29:19.089
Get these bastards.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.367
NCIS.

29:30.369 --> 29:31.802
What's going on?

29:31.804 --> 29:34.471
My guess is a drive-by,
or maybe a robbery.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.940
No bag or I.D. On her.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.088
Ellie?

29:55.795 --> 29:57.227
Adam.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.530
Is it her? Is that Daisy?

30:00.866 --> 30:02.499
I knew it.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.334
Knew what?
This.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.502
Don't you understand?

30:05.504 --> 30:07.070
We are probably next.

30:07.072 --> 30:09.373
Here.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.408
Take my report.
That's what she wanted.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.377
I'm out. I just...

30:13.379 --> 30:15.846
I can't, Ellie.

30:15.848 --> 30:18.916
I'm sorry.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.322
(Sighs)

30:34.834 --> 30:37.401
Bishop:
<i> Sir, let me explain this</i>
<i> as accurately as possible.</i>

30:37.403 --> 30:40.237
<i> No disrespect to my fellow</i>
<i> government employees,</i>

30:40.239 --> 30:42.840
<i> but some people like</i>
<i> pushing paper.</i>

30:42.842 --> 30:44.408
<i> My ex-husband Jake loves it.</i>

30:44.410 --> 30:46.543
<i> The minutiae, the redundancy.</i>

30:46.545 --> 30:48.245
<i> Maybe I should have paid</i>
<i> more attention</i>

30:48.247 --> 30:49.913
<i> to our differences sooner.</i>

30:49.915 --> 30:53.116
<i> The fact is,</i>
<i> we couldn't allow this case</i>

30:53.118 --> 30:55.986
<i> to get bogged down</i>
<i> in Washington bureaucracy.</i>

30:55.988 --> 30:57.921
<i> We needed answers fast.</i>

30:57.923 --> 30:59.223
Tony:
What are you guys working on?

30:59.225 --> 31:01.024
Well, we're trying
to access the GPS trackers

31:01.026 --> 31:02.993
that were sold
in the same batch

31:02.995 --> 31:05.229
as the one planted
in Alessandra ramos.
Hmm.

31:05.231 --> 31:09.032
Once we do that, then hopefully,
we can trace their location.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.001
Any luck finding
that purchaser?
Ah.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.202
I wouldn't exactly
call it luck.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.904
The GPS batch
was purchased

31:13.906 --> 31:15.472
by vanderhusen industries,

31:15.474 --> 31:19.209
the first in a seemingly endless
series of dummy corporations.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.511
So, you're, like,
dummy lucky, hmm?

31:21.513 --> 31:24.481
In a sense. The names
were even dumber, though.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.551
Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent,
Peter Parker.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.387
They're using superheroes
secret identities?

31:30.389 --> 31:32.489
Just when you thought they
couldn't be more despicable.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.057
I got a ping!

31:34.059 --> 31:35.092
One of the trackers?

31:36.929 --> 31:37.995
Yeah. No.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.197
Three trackers!
Three pings.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.531
All pinging from
the same location.

31:41.533 --> 31:42.900
It's a cargo terminal

31:42.902 --> 31:45.202
at Virginia port authority.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.904
They're getting ready
to ship the girls

31:46.906 --> 31:48.205
out of the country.
I'll call Gibbs.

31:48.207 --> 31:50.674
Send us those coordinates.
Yeah.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.070
Man:
Yeah.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.638
They're done.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.274
What? Can't hear you.
Call me back.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.710
NCIS!

32:26.712 --> 32:29.413
Hands in the air!

32:31.150 --> 32:33.016
Stop.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.346
Jane Murphy?

33:04.016 --> 33:05.282
You're all safe now.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.984
We're here to help.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.461
Anything else
you can tell me?

33:17.463 --> 33:22.132
We were blindfolded
most of the time.

33:22.134 --> 33:25.168
Only one of them spoke
in English.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.138
He's the one
that shot that girl.

33:28.140 --> 33:31.742
She fought back,
and he told us

33:31.744 --> 33:34.745
if we tried to escape,
the same would happen for us.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.014
I thought I was never gonna see

33:37.016 --> 33:39.182
my family again.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.018
(Voice breaking):
Jane!

33:41.020 --> 33:42.285
Dad!

33:42.287 --> 33:44.121
(Crying):
Oh, thank god.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.123
Oh, my baby.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.758
Thank god you're safe.

33:47.760 --> 33:50.093
Gibbs, we got a problem.

33:50.095 --> 33:53.030
Abby just called
with the ballistics report.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.132
The bullet that killed
agent milner came

33:55.134 --> 33:57.534
from the same .380
that shot Alessandra ramos.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.536
.380?

33:59.538 --> 34:01.338
These guys all had glock 17s.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.074
Where's bishop?

34:04.076 --> 34:05.675
Went to see Connors.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.211
Said he was shaken up
about agent milner.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.120
Bishop:
Adam!

34:17.122 --> 34:19.823
We caught them. It's okay.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.294
Ellie... you scared the hell
out of me.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.263
It's over.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.465
It is?
Mm-hmm.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.133
Just saved three girls

34:30.135 --> 34:32.202
about to be shipped off
from port authority.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.171
Took out two of their men.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.640
That's great, about
the girls at least,

34:36.642 --> 34:38.241
but it doesn't
make it over.

34:38.243 --> 34:41.211
You gotta know this thing
runs deeper than two men.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.815
Then help us find the others.

34:44.817 --> 34:48.251
We can shut down
this whole operation together.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.220
How many times do I have
to say no?

34:50.222 --> 34:53.090
All right, you've got my report.
Everything I know is in there.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.459
In here?

34:55.461 --> 34:57.494
Somehow I doubt that.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.163
I looked at your report
again, and...

35:00.165 --> 35:03.834
The details seemed
unfamiliar somehow.

35:03.836 --> 35:05.235
Well, it's been a few years.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.803
New numbers,

35:06.805 --> 35:10.407
slightly altered names
and dates.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.409
What do you mean "altered?"

35:12.411 --> 35:14.377
I remember
just enough about this case

35:14.379 --> 35:16.746
to know that this isn't
your original report.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.150
It's a smokescreen,
a wild goose chase.

35:20.152 --> 35:23.320
Think maybe the badge and gun
have made you paranoid, Ellie.

35:23.322 --> 35:26.289
It was you who figured out
concubine's money trail.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.824
How much did they offer you

35:27.826 --> 35:30.227
to get their operation up
and running again?

35:30.229 --> 35:31.561
(Laughs quietly)

35:31.563 --> 35:34.231
Okay, now
you're just talking crazy.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.567
Daisy called you
and said she was getting close.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.202
It was only a matter of time

35:39.204 --> 35:41.204
before she found you.

35:41.206 --> 35:43.173
So you killed her

35:43.175 --> 35:45.809
and handed me this road map in
the completely wrong direction.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.380
Guess I'm not so crazy.

35:50.382 --> 35:53.216
A little too smart, maybe.

35:53.218 --> 35:56.486
How much is NCIS paying<i> you?</i>

35:59.258 --> 36:01.291
It's a .380 you're going for,
isn't it?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.759
Look, you gotta understand...

36:02.761 --> 36:03.860
No, she doesn't!

36:08.333 --> 36:10.233
You sell women.

36:10.235 --> 36:13.303
There's not much to understand.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.871
Get up!
(Adam groaning)

36:16.175 --> 36:19.309
I'm sure it'll be toasty warm
in prison. Let's go.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.953
Bishop:
<i> Mr. president...</i>

36:29.955 --> 36:32.189
<i> I said this case made me</i>
<i> reconsider why</i>

36:32.191 --> 36:34.291
<i> I became an agent.</i>

36:34.293 --> 36:36.526
<i>Well, that's not entirely true.</i>

36:36.528 --> 36:39.396
<i>It made me want to work harder.</i>

36:39.398 --> 36:43.266
<i> I wish I could have saved</i>
<i> the two women we lost.</i>

36:43.268 --> 36:45.902
<i> I wish I could have stopped</i>
<i> Connors from the beginning.</i>

36:45.904 --> 36:49.773
<i> But... all I can do now</i>
<i> is look forward;</i>

36:49.775 --> 36:52.943
<i> forward to working with</i>
<i> the best team in the world,</i>

36:52.945 --> 36:55.912
<i> to be the best agent I can be.</i>

37:07.893 --> 37:08.992
Hey.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.328
Hey.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.364
So, uh, interpol went through
everything on Adam's computer.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.866
Got all the buyers,
contacts, accomplices.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.970
Should be able to take down
the whole trafficking ring.

37:19.972 --> 37:23.373
Hopefully for good this time.

37:26.878 --> 37:28.545
Tony: Here you go!

37:28.547 --> 37:31.681
¶ Susan,
get 'em while they're hot! ¶

37:31.683 --> 37:33.984
that's for you.
All right, now, Bob,

37:33.986 --> 37:35.986
please wear an undershirt
when you put this on.

37:37.389 --> 37:38.688
These are for me.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.823
What are you doing?

37:39.825 --> 37:41.258
Well, it's been a while

37:41.260 --> 37:43.393
since I splurged
on an office gift, so,

37:43.395 --> 37:46.329
I guess I just needed...
The inspiration.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.665
Mm!

37:50.502 --> 37:52.936
Uh, it's not that bad.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.671
Bad? These aren't bad at all.
Look at this.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.973
You kidding?
I love these.

37:58.277 --> 37:59.476
This is great. Look,

37:59.478 --> 38:02.345
I am who I am
because of what I was,

38:02.347 --> 38:04.748
so, guess what?
I am not ashamed of this.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.784
You know, when you act
all adult and noble,

38:07.786 --> 38:09.919
(whispers):
Nobody's feeling it.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.822
Ugh! Bad news, guys.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.592
Transformer iced over
and blew at my apartment.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.361
What are we gonna do?

38:18.363 --> 38:19.829
The last time I slept
in this big orange room,

38:19.831 --> 38:21.031
I had psychedelic nightmares.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.432
Stayed with me for months.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.767
Oh, I can't go to a hotel.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.368
All the rooms
in the city are booked.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.380
(Sleigh bells jingling on TV)

38:45.457 --> 38:47.357
This movie's always
had pacing problems for me.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.793
What do you mean?
It's a classic.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.361
It's not like
he made it warmer.

38:51.363 --> 38:52.796
(Scoffs quietly)

38:52.798 --> 38:54.331
Boss, you have a kettle?

38:54.333 --> 38:55.999
Maybe we can make some tea
or some hot chocolate?

38:56.001 --> 38:58.001
Mmm! I could have
some hot chocolate.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.736
There's a surprise.

38:59.738 --> 39:02.339
Shh!

39:04.843 --> 39:07.344
Stop it! You're kicking me.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.878
Linda Mason (On TV):
So, you're the big shot...
I'm not kicking you.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.347
I'm not touching you.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.915
Linda (On TV):
...Good enough for your place.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.350
Jim Hardy (On TV):
Oh, that wasn't exactly hay

39:13.352 --> 39:15.485
you were throwing, either.

39:15.487 --> 39:17.421
Jim (In higher voice):
"I'm Linda Mason."

39:17.422 --> 39:19.356
Linda:
All right, you're a fake,
and I'm a phony.
