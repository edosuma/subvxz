01:13.834 --> 01:15.375
When I was your age,

01:15.375 --> 01:17.667
I used to stand right here
next to grandpa

01:17.667 --> 01:19.333
and prune
these very vines.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.500
Really, dad?

01:20.500 --> 01:22.667
Really.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.333
Was dad ever my age,
grandpa?

01:25.333 --> 01:26.667
Yes, he was.

01:26.667 --> 01:29.166
Sometimes I think
he still is your age.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.834
Hey, would you two
lay off of me?

01:30.834 --> 01:32.500
We're just kidding!

01:32.500 --> 01:34.667
All right.
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

01:34.667 --> 01:36.917
Will you two be able to manage
without me?

01:36.917 --> 01:38.166
We'll be just fine, son.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.291
You keep an eye
on grandpa,

01:40.291 --> 01:43.083
make sure he does a good job
and stays out of trouble?

01:43.083 --> 01:45.125
Roger that, captain dad.

01:45.125 --> 01:47.959
Why don't you go check
your pots and pans?

01:47.959 --> 01:49.000
Don't be late.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.083
We'll be there.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.709
How am I doing,
grandpa?

01:51.709 --> 01:53.083
Just like an expert.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.166
I'm sorry
lunch was cut short.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.875
You have a meeting.
I understand.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.208
I will see you tonight,
though, won't I?
Of course.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.709
We'll go to the Jacobson's
for drinks,

02:11.709 --> 02:12.917
do a little networking,

02:12.917 --> 02:15.583
then on to the grove for dinner
and new year's.

02:15.583 --> 02:16.959
Hey, are you
still on for dinner

02:16.959 --> 02:18.542
at the oak room
on the 14th?

02:18.542 --> 02:19.709
I'm in court that day,

02:19.709 --> 02:21.625
so I'm probably working late
to brief the client.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.333
No problem.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.583
Can you still make the Ogilvie
reception on the 6th?

02:24.583 --> 02:26.250
No, I have a late meeting
in the afternoon.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.208
It's all right.

02:28.208 --> 02:29.792
I'll move it to earlier
in the day.

02:29.792 --> 02:31.417
Yeah?

02:31.417 --> 02:33.625
All right,
I got to run.

02:33.625 --> 02:35.583
You go in there,
and you get them, tiger.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.208
Then I'll pick you up
after my last appointment.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.542
I'll see you later.

02:42.125 --> 02:44.542
Smells wonderful!

02:44.542 --> 02:45.750
Hi, mom.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.625
I have been starving ever
since you started that sauce.

02:48.625 --> 02:51.000
Try this.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.291
Saffron?

02:54.291 --> 02:56.083
Nah. My secret.

02:56.083 --> 02:57.917
Well,
it's delicious as always.

02:57.917 --> 02:59.250
I know it's selfish,

02:59.250 --> 03:02.500
but I am so glad you decided
to take that celebrity chef spot

03:02.500 --> 03:03.583
at the resort.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.917
I just love that I get
to keep you guys around

03:05.917 --> 03:07.709
for an extra
couple of weeks.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.458
Well, just an excuse

03:10.458 --> 03:13.208
so that Luke and I can spend
more time with you and dad.

03:13.208 --> 03:16.125
Speaking of which,
where is my grandson?

03:16.125 --> 03:17.291
Out in the vineyard
with dad,

03:17.291 --> 03:18.792
determined to be
the next great vintner.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.625
Well, let's just hope
that the winery

03:20.625 --> 03:22.959
is still in the family
by the time Luke grows up.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.542
Mom, I told you,
if you need money --

03:25.542 --> 03:27.041
Andrew,
you are a dear heart,

03:27.041 --> 03:30.041
but you can only keep bailing
out a sinking ship for so long

03:30.041 --> 03:31.375
before it actually sinks.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.417
And I won't have you go down
with us.

03:33.417 --> 03:36.792
Mom --
could you please hand me
the, um, corkscrew?

03:39.500 --> 03:42.250
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:42.250 --> 03:43.667
if -- if I could have
your attention, please!

03:43.667 --> 03:45.667
Right. If you could all
take your seats.

03:45.667 --> 03:48.667
Johnny is gonna be with us
in just a moment

03:48.667 --> 03:50.041
so we can get started.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.458
Good. Good, Milton.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.709
I'm anxious to meet your new,
financial officer.

03:53.709 --> 03:56.041
From what I hear,
he is quite a hard-charger.

03:56.041 --> 03:59.333
I think you will find Johnny
very impressive.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.125
Hello, everyone!

04:01.125 --> 04:02.542
And you must be
Thomas Jenkins.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.750
I recognized you from last
month's issue of Forbes.

04:04.750 --> 04:06.667
Great article
on your banking firm.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.750
Thank you.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.875
Johnny prentis.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.333
It's a pleasure
to meet you...Johnny.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.125
Well, we have a lot
of ground to cover

04:13.125 --> 04:14.291
to get
this expansion rolling.

04:14.291 --> 04:17.083
So, if you don't mind,
Milton...

04:17.083 --> 04:18.250
Your show.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.083
Here at Stafford,

04:21.083 --> 04:24.083
we're poised to venture
into this uncharted territory.

04:24.083 --> 04:26.000
With boldness and precision,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.667
we can and will dominate
this new frontier.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.667
No other company has
the know-how or resources

04:30.667 --> 04:32.625
to do
what we intend to do.

04:32.625 --> 04:34.542
Now, if you skip ahead...

04:34.542 --> 04:35.709
Come on, grandpa!

04:35.709 --> 04:37.834
Hey, Luke!
Luke, don't go so fast!

04:37.834 --> 04:40.250
You're gonna kill
your old grandfather!

04:40.250 --> 04:43.208
Dad! Dad!
Grandpa says I'm doing great!

04:44.542 --> 04:47.208
You certainly are becoming
quite the vintner.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.083
Grandpa must be proud.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.458
In more ways than one.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.083
He may be a vintner
and champion track star.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.208
This kid runs faster
than a rabbit!

04:55.208 --> 04:56.709
I bet I could catch
a rabbit.

04:56.709 --> 04:59.083
All right, champ,
go get washed up for dinner.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.583
That's one
smart little fella.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.041
Wine gene must have skipped
a generation.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.917
Come on,
you could have been a master
if you'd wanted to.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.709
You just didn't have
a passion for it.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.166
I only hope we're still
in the wine business

05:14.166 --> 05:16.166
when Luke
comes into his own.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.417
Not you two, dad.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.458
Come on,
we'll figure something out.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.458
Hey, guys.

05:21.458 --> 05:24.000
Are you gonna drive to L.A.
after dinner

05:24.000 --> 05:25.083
to check
on the restaurant?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.291
I mean, after all,
it is new year's Eve.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.959
Yeah, I was,
but Stephanie said

05:28.959 --> 05:30.291
she's got everything
under control.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.458
I like Stephanie.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.750
You know,
she's a very smart woman.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.917
And pretty, too,
I think.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.875
Why isn't she up here

05:35.875 --> 05:37.417
helping you
at the corporate retreat?

05:37.417 --> 05:40.000
Mom, she just manages
my restaurant.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.667
And she just got engaged.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.750
That's...Too bad.

05:43.750 --> 05:44.917
Mom.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.834
Honey,
I just want you to be happy.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.333
I just don't want you to be,
you know, alone.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.417
I'm not alone.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.208
I've got you two and Luke.

05:52.208 --> 05:54.041
We're always
here for you, son,

05:54.041 --> 05:56.458
but you need more in your life
than work,

05:56.458 --> 05:57.959
a couple of aging parents,

05:57.959 --> 05:59.959
and a young one
to keep you company.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.458
Dad, I really appreciate you
looking out for me.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.458
But I'm fine, really.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.000
Now go get washed up
for dinner.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.333
Here's one for you.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.333
Thank you.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.500
Thank you.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.667
Um, bring us a bottle
of your best champagne.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.959
Actually, I'm glad I was
able to finagle reservations.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.709
This place is booked
months in advance,

06:28.709 --> 06:30.500
especially for new year's Eve,
you know?

06:30.500 --> 06:33.166
Well, it's lovely.

06:33.166 --> 06:36.041
I hear the food here is some
of the best in the city.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.750
It's great.

06:45.792 --> 06:48.875
We've got a number of specials
tonight for the holiday.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.542
I would love to tell you
about them.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.375
Christopher?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.166
The papers just came back
on the motion I filed,

06:58.166 --> 07:00.166
and I've got to look it over
before dinner.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.834
Well...

07:03.834 --> 07:07.333
We're at dinner.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.792
On new year's Eve.

07:09.792 --> 07:12.166
Exactly.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.166
Exactly.
You're right.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.333
So let's...

07:21.875 --> 07:23.333
...talk about
something else.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.166
Did I tell you
that I got invited

07:28.166 --> 07:31.041
to the telecom conference
in wine country next week?

07:31.041 --> 07:32.041
Really?

07:32.041 --> 07:35.208
A toast then to...

07:35.208 --> 07:38.208
My bigwig girlfriend,

07:38.208 --> 07:39.917
the financial wizard,

07:39.917 --> 07:42.583
and to...

07:42.583 --> 07:45.041
Our first
new year's Eve together.

07:46.375 --> 07:50.208
And I'm sorry I won't be seeing
the midnight hour,

07:50.208 --> 07:51.875
because I've got to go back
to work.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.208
Pie!

07:58.208 --> 08:00.667
I get to put on
15 more pounds.

08:00.667 --> 08:03.000
I love that my guys
are all together.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.750
A toast --
to a wonderful new year

08:06.750 --> 08:09.333
and the greatest family
a man could want.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.750
Happy new year.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.250
Happy new year.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.291
So, do I get to stay up
till midnight?

08:20.291 --> 08:23.083
Midnight?
Are you kidding me?

08:23.083 --> 08:25.333
Sweetheart,
it's new year's Eve.

08:25.333 --> 08:27.583
It's new year's Eve.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.333
I know,
but that's awfully late.

08:29.333 --> 08:33.332
I promise I'll get up real early
to help with the tree,

08:33.332 --> 08:37.582
and I'll even do
the dishes tonight.

08:39.958 --> 08:41.082
All right, then.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.417
But at 12:01,

08:42.417 --> 08:45.625
you're marching straight off
to bed, mister!

08:45.625 --> 08:46.834
Deal.

08:47.792 --> 08:51.500
I told you,
bribery works every time.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.667
It feels strange
ending new year's Eve

08:56.667 --> 08:58.000
before the new year.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm sorry.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.792
It's just, I have to get
this brief ready for court.

09:04.458 --> 09:06.000
Want to have breakfast
tomorrow morning?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.041
I do.
I'll call you.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.500
Great.

09:34.250 --> 09:36.750
Luke and your dad
have a lot in common --

09:36.750 --> 09:39.083
they were both out
by 10:00.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.250
Yeah,
we're an exciting bunch.

09:41.250 --> 09:43.875
Pajamas and hot chocolate
on new year's Eve.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.959
Wouldn't the tabloids
love to know

09:45.959 --> 09:47.959
that famous chef
Andrew Browning

09:47.959 --> 09:51.166
spent tonight having dinner
with his boring old parents?

09:51.166 --> 09:52.333
No.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.458
You know I love spending time
with you guys.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.041
Plus,
it's great for Luke, too.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.917
You should be out
having fun

09:57.917 --> 09:59.375
on a night like tonight.

09:59.375 --> 10:03.375
You know, slow dancing
with a beautiful woman.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.458
Andy...

10:05.458 --> 10:09.291
Meredith would want you
to be happy.

10:09.291 --> 10:10.750
And I am.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.125
I love you to pieces,
honey,

10:12.125 --> 10:14.208
but you know better
than to lie to your mother.

10:14.208 --> 10:16.417
I love you, too, mom.

10:19.041 --> 10:23.542
Another new year.
They go by so fast.

10:23.542 --> 10:24.709
Faster and faster.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.875
So don't waste
a precious moment

10:26.875 --> 10:28.750
of the time
that you have.

10:28.750 --> 10:32.375
I've got so many plans
for Luke and me.

10:32.375 --> 10:35.875
You know,
they say if you don't believe

10:35.875 --> 10:37.500
that god
has a sense of humor,

10:37.500 --> 10:39.542
make a lot of plans
and see what happens.

10:39.542 --> 10:41.792
Is that so?

10:41.792 --> 10:43.959
Have a little faith
that somebody up there

10:43.959 --> 10:45.291
knows what's best for you,

10:45.291 --> 10:47.583
somebody besides
your long-suffering mother.

10:49.500 --> 10:53.667
Well, I've had about as much fun
as I can stand in one day,

10:53.667 --> 10:55.250
so I'm going to bed.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.417
See you in the morning.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.250
Good night, honey.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.625
Happy new year's, mom.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.291
Happy new year.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.667
George, could you run these down
to legal for me?

11:18.667 --> 11:21.917
Johnny,
I have those reports.

11:21.917 --> 11:24.083
Now give me the gossip about
your date with Christopher.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.583
Nothing to gossip about.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.750
Come on.
Tell me all about it.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.917
Food was great.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.291
And the company?

11:30.291 --> 11:33.000
What's wrong with the company?
Are my numbers off?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.500
I meant
the dinner company.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.750
But just to get the business
out of the way,

11:36.750 --> 11:38.875
since I know
that's all you think about,

11:38.875 --> 11:41.125
you're completely right
that a successful expansion

11:41.125 --> 11:43.291
would put Stafford
in an entirely new bracket.

11:43.291 --> 11:46.291
I'm sensing a "but" here.

11:46.291 --> 11:47.291
Well...

11:47.291 --> 11:48.625
Not a "but," an "if."

11:48.625 --> 11:50.500
It will catapult us into
a different set of clientele

11:50.500 --> 11:52.000
if we manage
to pull this off.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.458
We'll be right up there
with Debra Miller's company.

11:54.458 --> 11:57.625
Miss corporate barracuda?
There's a power broker.

11:57.625 --> 12:00.125
It will be a delicate
balancing act.

12:00.125 --> 12:04.458
Competition with Debra Miller.
We can do it.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.709
Yeah, as long as we sign
these investors.

12:05.709 --> 12:07.917
Without the money,
we don't have a shot.

12:07.917 --> 12:10.583
I'm not particularly worried
about that.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.834
We sold the pitch
to Jenkins.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.166
Well, then we have nothing
to worry about.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.250
Which leads me back
to your personal life,

12:20.250 --> 12:21.667
where I worry very much.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.166
How was new year's
with Christopher?

12:24.166 --> 12:25.834
It was fine,
like it always is.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.417
Meaning?

12:27.417 --> 12:29.709
He had a brief to prepare.
We cut the date short.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.458
We met for breakfast
the next day.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.500
And then I came to the office
to work, alone.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.000
How romantic.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.834
What do you want me
to tell you, Renee?

12:37.834 --> 12:39.667
Christopher's a nice guy.
I enjoy his company.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.166
Are you in love
with him?

12:41.166 --> 12:43.625
We have our careers.

12:43.625 --> 12:46.875
Hey, Johnny,
you are my best friend.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.500
And as far
as career goes,

12:48.500 --> 12:50.500
you are always
on the right path.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.083
When I was a little girl,

12:52.083 --> 12:55.000
I always had this fantasy
of a knight in shining armor

12:55.000 --> 12:57.875
swooping in and whisking me
off my feet.

12:57.875 --> 13:01.125
That's a dream.
I have a career to focus on now.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.792
Hello?

13:02.792 --> 13:04.458
Johnny,
I'd like to see you right away.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.041
Heading right there, Milton.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.375
Right, well, call me

13:07.375 --> 13:08.709
after you've talked
to Thomas, then, will you?

13:08.709 --> 13:10.417
Thanks.

13:10.417 --> 13:11.583
Do we get it?

13:11.583 --> 13:14.083
Jenkins called to say
he needed more time

13:14.083 --> 13:17.250
before approving the financing
we requested.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.291
All right, well,
I'll cancel my trip

13:20.291 --> 13:21.792
to the conference
this weekend.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.000
No, don't do that.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.750
A lot of the key players
are gonna be there.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.583
Who knows, you may find
a new investment pool.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.875
I need you to be
our eyes and ears.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.250
You can count on me.
I know that.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.625
And, Johnny...

13:34.625 --> 13:38.000
You're still allowed
to take time to eat,

13:38.000 --> 13:40.250
see some of that amazing
wine-country scenery

13:40.250 --> 13:41.959
while you're out there,
you know?

13:41.959 --> 13:43.792
If I have the time.

13:43.792 --> 13:45.375
Make time.

13:45.375 --> 13:47.542
Right.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.750
Afternoon, sir.
Thanks.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.917
Andrew, you'll be back before
the hors d'oeuvre reception?

14:00.917 --> 14:02.667
Absolutely,
just got to run to the vineyard

14:02.667 --> 14:03.667
and pick up
the little guy.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.917
Okay.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.750
And thank you.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.667
Your parents' wine
is excellent.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.083
Our guests
are going to love it.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.125
See ya.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.917
Here you go, ma'am.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.667
And, Renee,
I need you to be on call

14:16.667 --> 14:18.333
every minute
of this weekend.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.083
All right,
you're my second in command,

14:20.083 --> 14:21.542
and it falls to you
to make sure

14:21.542 --> 14:23.375
everybody stays in line
and keeps working.

14:23.375 --> 14:26.208
Sure.
Have fun at the conference.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.208
It's a conference.
I'm not here to have fun.

14:28.208 --> 14:29.375
Please.

14:29.375 --> 14:30.917
It's essentially
a corporate retreat

14:30.917 --> 14:32.208
with a few seminars
thrown in

14:32.208 --> 14:34.375
to justify the expense of
massages and vineyard tours.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.542
Have fun.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.000
All right. Thanks.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
We're gonna do exactly like
we did last time, okay.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.583
Hopefully,
they'll be repeat offenders,

14:43.583 --> 14:45.625
and everything
should go fine.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.333
There are gonna be
some difficulties.
Yeah.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.834
It's gonna be a very odd
transition for them.
Yeah.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.000
Yes, I know.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.667
I just need to get
the research --

15:05.667 --> 15:07.000
Thomas Jenkins.

15:08.625 --> 15:10.417
Johnny.

15:10.417 --> 15:12.166
How nice
to see you again.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.250
Do you know Debra Miller?

15:13.250 --> 15:15.000
You know,
we've never actually met.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.834
But I do like to keep up
on our competition

15:16.834 --> 15:18.000
in the telecom industry.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.875
I just finished reading
your book, miss Miller.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.000
I'm Johnny prentis.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.500
Well,
I hope you enjoyed it.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.333
Yes,
it was very inspiring.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.667
So, I had no idea

15:26.667 --> 15:28.208
that you planned on attending
the conference.

15:28.208 --> 15:30.417
Well, I could say
the same thing about you.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.709
True.

15:31.709 --> 15:34.917
Have you tried
this California oak cabernet?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.500
Mnh-mnh.
We've been sampling it.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
It's very, very good.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.500
You should try some.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.542
It's exquisite.

15:39.542 --> 15:41.208
Didn't you say
that this winery

15:41.208 --> 15:42.375
was one of those
on our tour tomorrow?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.458
Yes.
Yes, great.

15:43.458 --> 15:44.542
Well, you know,

15:44.542 --> 15:46.125
we might actually
bump into you tomorrow.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.709
I hope so.

15:47.709 --> 15:50.375
Would you, 
please excuse us?

15:50.375 --> 15:53.458
I've taken Thomas away
from other guests long enough.

15:53.458 --> 15:54.917
It was nice meeting you.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.417
It was nice
to meet you, too.

15:56.417 --> 15:57.959
Enjoy the party,
Johnny.

15:57.959 --> 15:59.041
Thank you. You, too.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.250
Christopher!

16:11.250 --> 16:12.583
What are you doing here?

16:12.583 --> 16:13.750
Surprising you.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.083
That's an understatement.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.917
This is a work conference.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.500
Well, I called Renee.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.208
You called Renee.

16:21.208 --> 16:24.041
Well, I called Renee,
and I changed some appointments.

16:24.041 --> 16:25.333
And she said it was okay

16:25.333 --> 16:27.583
because others were bringing
their spouses

16:27.583 --> 16:28.750
and significant others.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.667
I guess it would be advantageous
to have you here.

16:32.667 --> 16:35.291
People might be less guarded
talking to you than to me.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.166
That's actually
quite savvy.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.458
Well, set me loose.
I'm here to help you.

16:40.458 --> 16:45.083
And I was hoping later we could
maybe have...A conversation?

16:45.083 --> 16:48.583
Conversation.
Of course.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.083
Let's go network.
Okay.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.917
Here.
Thank you.

16:52.917 --> 16:56.583
I can't believe people
came all the way out here

16:56.583 --> 16:57.917
just to see you.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.917
I mean,
you're a good cook and all,

16:59.917 --> 17:02.709
but it's not like you're
a football star or anything.

17:02.709 --> 17:04.458
What, do I got to throw
a wicked pass

17:04.458 --> 17:05.625
to be famous
in your eyes?

17:05.625 --> 17:09.500
No. I would rather
you just be my dad.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.583
Works for me.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.791
Excuse me. Do you have
any idea what this is?

17:18.791 --> 17:20.666
Is it wine
or some kind of a punch?

17:20.666 --> 17:23.000
Cider, I think.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.583
But those are great.
Good.

17:24.583 --> 17:25.959
Yeah,
they're really good.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.333
I-I'm
Christopher Stanley.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.041
Thomas Jenkins.
Pleasure.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.792
I-I'm sure I'll see you around
this weekend.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.959
Enjoy.
I'll leave some of the food
for you.

17:32.959 --> 17:37.792
Laire, how nice to see you.
How are you?

17:38.834 --> 17:41.625
Haven't we met before?

17:41.625 --> 17:43.625
I'm Christopher Stanley.
Right.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.667
You were the attorney who
represented the goodwin brothers

17:46.667 --> 17:48.750
in the class-action lawsuit
last year.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.834
Very impressive work.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.959
I put together
the financial package

17:52.959 --> 17:54.667
that kept them out
of chapter 11.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.875
I'm Debra Miller.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.041
I remember.

17:57.041 --> 17:58.542
And speaking
of impressive,

17:58.542 --> 18:00.041
the structured
settlement plan

18:00.041 --> 18:02.125
you put together
was genius.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.583
Are you here representing
a telecom company?

18:04.583 --> 18:05.917
I am not.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.834
I am here with my girlfriend,
Johnny prentis?

18:07.834 --> 18:10.458
I just met Johnny. She seems
like a very lovely young woman.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.333
She is.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.000
I've just been standing here
eating the food.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.500
It's fantastic.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.834
It is. It is.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.834
They brought in some top chef
as a guest chef here.

18:18.834 --> 18:20.000
Anyone I'd know?

18:20.000 --> 18:22.041
Andrew Browning.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.500
Of Browning's
in Beverly Hills?

18:23.500 --> 18:26.291
And the fields
in Las Vegas.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, the wait list is a year.
I can't get a table.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.041
I can introduce
you later.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.583
Well, I would appreciate that.
That's fantastic.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.917
No, no. He was just
as surprised to see me.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.667
He was talking to Debra Miller.

18:36.667 --> 18:39.625
We all know her reputation
for buying small companies

18:39.625 --> 18:41.375
and dismantling them for assets.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.166
Hey, when you're done
with that...

18:43.166 --> 18:46.792
You know what? I will keep you
posted if I hear anything else.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.458
I am so sorry.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.041
That's all right.
It's fine, really.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.709
But you're covered
in wine.

18:54.709 --> 18:57.709
It's -- it's okay.

18:57.709 --> 19:00.542
Well, at least
it's a great vintage.

19:00.542 --> 19:02.083
Thank you.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.458
Let me -- let me get your coat
dry-cleaned.

19:04.458 --> 19:05.792
No, it's fine.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.583
I've got 100 of these things
laying around.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.709
I'm deeply sorry.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.583
I'm Johnny prentis.

19:11.583 --> 19:14.083
I'm --
Andrew Browning?

19:14.083 --> 19:15.291
You know him?

19:15.291 --> 19:16.583
Hi, Debra.

19:16.583 --> 19:19.458
Wait, and you know her.
Yes.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.125
Andrew, this is
Christopher Stanley.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.250
Hi.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.250
Okay, and you know her.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.583
Debra and I worked

19:26.583 --> 19:28.625
on the goodwin brothers
case last year,

19:28.625 --> 19:31.083
and we just ran into each other
at the reception.

19:31.083 --> 19:33.417
I -- I was just
telling Debra

19:33.417 --> 19:34.458
that I have been dying to go

19:34.458 --> 19:35.625
to your restaurant
in Beverly Hills.

19:35.625 --> 19:37.250
You are?

19:37.250 --> 19:38.959
Yeah, absolutely.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.750
Andrew's one of the
leaders of gastropub cuisine

19:40.750 --> 19:42.291
here in the states.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.500
Well, if you say so.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.125
It was a pleasure
meeting you both.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.250
If you'll excuse me,

19:47.250 --> 19:50.125
I need to go change my coat
and find my son.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.834
The moment he smelled food,
he disappeared.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.875
But, please, stop by
Browning's as my guest.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.333
I certainly will.
Thanks.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.667
Bye.

19:59.667 --> 20:00.959
It was nice
meeting you.

20:00.959 --> 20:02.625
Thank you for the wine.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.834
She's up to something.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.333
Debra Miller?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.125
Well, that's a safe bet.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.959
But it probably has nothing
to do with you.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.709
She's just here to network
with industry leaders,

20:25.709 --> 20:27.000
same as you.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.750
And how did you know
about Andrew Browning?

20:30.750 --> 20:34.959
One of my clients is a huge fan
for some reason.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.834
And I just scored
major points

20:36.834 --> 20:39.333
getting an impossible-to-get
reservation.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.667
That's great, Christopher.

20:41.667 --> 20:45.333
Hey, 
about the conversation...

20:46.500 --> 20:48.125
Can it wait till tomorrow?

20:48.125 --> 20:50.208
I want to log a few more hours
of networking,

20:50.208 --> 20:51.709
and then I have
to get some sleep.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.041
I'm exhausted.

20:53.041 --> 20:57.041
I promise you, tomorrow,
I'll be rested and awake.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.834
Of course.

21:05.083 --> 21:09.041
Renee, I really need that
information e-mailed to me asap.

21:09.041 --> 21:11.583
I'll send it just as soon
as I hang up with you.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.917
Great.
And what about the winery tour?

21:12.917 --> 21:14.709
You're booked
on the same tour

21:14.709 --> 21:15.875
as Debra Miller
and Jenkins.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.792
It leaves right
after your round of golf.

21:17.792 --> 21:19.125
I hate golf.

21:19.125 --> 21:21.625
Johnny,
it's the one activity today

21:21.625 --> 21:23.625
where Miller and Jenkins
aren't attached at the hip.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.625
You need one-on-one time
to seal the deal.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.041
I'm making sure
you get it.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.500
I knew there was a reason
why I left you in charge.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.417
You didn't have a choice.
I'm your number two.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.917
And by the way,
I want to thank you

21:32.917 --> 21:34.750
for encouraging Christopher
to drive up here.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.250
So you're having fun?

21:36.250 --> 21:38.041
No, Christopher's
actually really great

21:38.041 --> 21:40.000
at dealing
with the other executives.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You're using your boyfriend
to network?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.166
I am not using him.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.166
Believe me, he's getting
just as much out of it.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.667
You do know what the word "fun"
means, don't you?

21:47.667 --> 21:50.041
Look, I'll call you later.

21:50.041 --> 21:52.792
Just send that e-mail
as soon as we hang up.

21:52.792 --> 21:55.166
You got it.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.667
And it's called a birdie.

21:57.667 --> 21:58.959
Let's go hit
some golf balls.

21:58.959 --> 22:01.083
All right.

22:17.792 --> 22:19.959
Well, that was fun.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.625
And you played well,
considering.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.500
Considering what?

22:23.500 --> 22:25.250
Considering you spent
most of the round

22:25.250 --> 22:26.750
pumping Thomas
for information.

22:26.750 --> 22:29.750
I know.
And I got nothing.

22:29.750 --> 22:31.125
Well,
what did you expect?

22:31.125 --> 22:33.125
That he was gonna spill
10 years' worth

22:33.125 --> 22:34.625
of corporate secrets
to you?

22:34.625 --> 22:36.500
Actually, yes.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.458
I do happen to be good
with people.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.458
I know.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.792
Hey.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.959
You played a heck of a round,
Johnny.

22:43.959 --> 22:46.125
But you should have told us
that Chris here's a ringer.

22:46.125 --> 22:47.792
No, no, no.
Just a good round.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.458
Yeah, I'll say.

22:49.458 --> 22:50.583
Hey, if you'll excuse me,

22:50.583 --> 22:51.959
I need to go change
before my tour leaves.

22:51.959 --> 22:54.625
We have to go change,
too.

22:54.625 --> 22:56.000
Let's go.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.792
So, Johnny, tell me,

22:58.792 --> 23:00.959
what do you enjoy doing
in your free time?

23:00.959 --> 23:02.417
Free time?

23:02.417 --> 23:04.709
Johnny doesn't actually know
what that is.

23:04.709 --> 23:06.625
Come on. We all have
our ways of relaxing.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.417
I find work relaxing,
actually.
Really?

23:08.417 --> 23:11.291
Well, I, 
hope you make time

23:11.291 --> 23:13.375
for this wonderful man
of yours.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.917
You should consider yourself
very lucky.

23:15.917 --> 23:18.291
I think she knows
how lucky she is, right?

23:18.291 --> 23:19.500
Of course I do.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.333
Debra, look,
I wanted to get your take on --

23:21.333 --> 23:23.291
please, no work talk now.

23:23.291 --> 23:26.875
Let's all just go enjoy
the wine country, okay?

23:26.875 --> 23:30.625
Of course.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.417
Okay, champ.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.667
You keep an eye
on grandma and grandpa.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.667
And the winery.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.333
Yes, and the winery.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.667
Do you have anything special
planned for tonight's menu?

23:43.667 --> 23:45.166
As a matter of fact, I do.

23:45.166 --> 23:48.166
Remember that recipe I tried out
on you the other day?

23:48.166 --> 23:49.667
You mean experimented
on me?

23:49.667 --> 23:50.709
Experimented?

23:50.709 --> 23:52.667
You say that
like I made you eat

23:52.667 --> 23:54.458
exploding soup
or something.

23:54.458 --> 23:55.959
You liked it, didn't you?

23:55.959 --> 23:56.917
It was awesome.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.208
Well, hopefully,

24:00.208 --> 24:02.709
the resort guests
will say the same.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.375
You stay out of trouble,

24:04.375 --> 24:06.208
grandma and grandpa
will bring you over later.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.458
Okay. Bye, dad.

24:08.458 --> 24:10.583
This is our California Merlot.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.083
It's, 
one of our best sellers.

24:12.083 --> 24:15.208
It has wonderful earth tones
and a medium body.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.875
And it's got a wonderful
long finish.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.041
I think you'll like it.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.208
Thank you.

24:22.375 --> 24:25.208
Hi. We have the Merlot
or the cabernet.

24:25.208 --> 24:27.875
So, you familiar with the, 
wine industry?

24:27.875 --> 24:29.208
Partially.

24:29.208 --> 24:31.667
I did a study on the beverage
industry a few years ago,

24:31.667 --> 24:33.709
which yielded some
very interesting results.

24:33.709 --> 24:35.917
She never really stops,
does she?

24:35.917 --> 24:38.709
Never.
It's part of her charm.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.458
The béarnaise is done.

24:46.458 --> 24:50.041
Yeah, he's still waiting
on that!

24:51.959 --> 24:54.125
So, you all set
for the big event?

24:54.125 --> 24:56.792
Absolutely.
Should be ready in no time.

24:56.792 --> 24:57.917
Fantastic.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.834
I can't tell you how excited
the guests are

24:59.834 --> 25:02.375
about the gala dinner
and your demonstration.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.959
Thank you for that,
by the way.

25:03.959 --> 25:05.750
Is that gonna be part
of your menu preview?

25:05.750 --> 25:08.125
Maybe. It just depends
on how it's received.

25:08.125 --> 25:10.250
A new recipe I tried out on Luke
the other night.

25:10.250 --> 25:13.208
That boy
has a sophisticated palate.

25:13.208 --> 25:15.125
Little guy's been getting
foie gras

25:15.125 --> 25:16.625
since before
he could speak.

25:16.625 --> 25:19.125
Can't be easy
raising him alone.

25:19.125 --> 25:21.875
It's not,
but you do what you can.

25:21.875 --> 25:26.125
Andrew,
it's been five years.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.208
Maybe it's time you allowed
yourself to open up,

25:30.208 --> 25:31.583
give life a chance.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.291
You sound like my mother.

25:33.291 --> 25:34.709
Besides, a relationship
is the furthest thing

25:34.709 --> 25:35.959
from my mind right now.

25:35.959 --> 25:38.667
Between keeping up with Luke
and the three restaurants,

25:38.667 --> 25:41.208
I barely have time
to sleep.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.542
Okay.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.792
But I had to tell you
as your friend.

25:44.792 --> 25:46.792
I'll go check
on the serving staff.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.834
Sure thing.

25:49.834 --> 25:51.792
Can you feel it?

25:51.792 --> 25:53.208
Feel what?

25:53.208 --> 25:55.000
Success, money,
prestige --

25:55.000 --> 25:56.959
it's all around us,
Johnny.

25:56.959 --> 25:58.959
These are some of the most
powerful people in the industry,

25:58.959 --> 26:00.542
some of the biggest fish.

26:00.542 --> 26:03.625
Well, it's my job to land
the biggest of the big.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.166
Yes, it is.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.000
Now you put on
your adorable smile,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.041
and you go cas
your bait.

26:10.041 --> 26:11.208
All right.

26:21.834 --> 26:24.500
I know I keep asking.
Did the package come?

26:24.500 --> 26:27.000
I'll check.
Here it is.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.333
Thank you.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.125
You're welcome.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.875
He's recently separated.
Well, maybe a year or two ago.

26:33.875 --> 26:34.959
I think they're not.

26:34.959 --> 26:36.083
I-I don't think
they got a divorce.

26:39.417 --> 26:40.917
Hello.

26:40.917 --> 26:42.458
Hello.

26:42.458 --> 26:44.166
Here
for the demonstration?

26:44.166 --> 26:45.250
Yes.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.250
People actually pay
to watch you cook?

26:47.250 --> 26:50.417
Yes, and enjoy my,
as Debra would say,

26:50.417 --> 26:52.125
"gastropub cuisine."

26:53.792 --> 26:56.959
Yeah, and what exactly
is gastropub cuisine?

26:56.959 --> 26:59.667
I'm taking classic fare,
adding a little gourmet twist --

26:59.667 --> 27:01.834
so, fine diner food.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.709
Sounds like
my kind of menu.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.875
Well, then you'll just have to
drag that boyfriend of yours

27:05.875 --> 27:07.000
into my restaurant
some time.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.417
No, any reservation
you get for him

27:09.417 --> 27:10.750
will be used impressing clients,
not me.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.750
Well, then we'll have to get you
one of your own.

27:12.750 --> 27:15.542
Nice to see you again,
Andrew.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.250
Good luck tonight. I'm looking
forward to seeing it.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.250
Well, thank you.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.041
And if you would
excuse me,

27:20.041 --> 27:21.375
I'm gonna go check
on your dinner.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.208
All right.
See you guys.

27:23.208 --> 27:26.291
Seems like
a nice fellow.
Yeah.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.500
There's Debra and Thomas.
Let's go, say hi.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.750
You know what, let's ask them
to join us for dinner.
Yeah.

27:36.291 --> 27:38.500
Everyone's raving
about the food.

27:38.500 --> 27:39.834
You're a true success.

27:39.834 --> 27:41.625
Well, the evening
isn't over yet.

27:41.625 --> 27:44.583
The demonstration?
You'll do just fine.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.500
Sorry, we're running
a little late.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.417
Hi, dad.
Miss Heidi.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.959
Hello, Luke.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.583
Mrs. Browning, your wine was
the highlight of the evening.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.041
Well,
that's good news.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.000
Maybe it'll help jump-start
the business.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.667
Hey, where's dad?

27:57.667 --> 27:58.750
We gave him
the evening off.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.417
Well, come on,
let's go get you two fed.

28:02.417 --> 28:04.166
I'm so glad we're seated
next to each other.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.417
I've really enjoyed chatting
with you.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.583
Me, too.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.083
Yeah,
after reading your book

28:09.083 --> 28:11.333
and all the success you've had
in your life,

28:11.333 --> 28:13.375
I was expecting you
to be a bit more --

28:13.375 --> 28:14.792
ruthless?

28:14.792 --> 28:16.458
Yes, I suppose.

28:16.458 --> 28:20.125
Well, I've certainly created
a business image,

28:20.125 --> 28:22.458
with focus and strength
being the key elements,

28:22.458 --> 28:24.917
but that doesn't mean
I can't also enjoy my life.

28:26.667 --> 28:29.458
Can I ask you
a personal question, then?

28:29.458 --> 28:32.792
Ask away.
I'm an open book, so to speak.

28:32.792 --> 28:34.375
There's been a lot
of speculation

28:34.375 --> 28:35.875
about why
you never got married,

28:35.875 --> 28:37.333
and you never commented
on it.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.625
Now, of course, you don't
have to answer my question,

28:39.625 --> 28:40.959
but I was just
wondering...

28:40.959 --> 28:43.959
I've had some very wonderfully
significant relationships

28:43.959 --> 28:45.458
in my life,

28:45.458 --> 28:48.000
but never with a man
who was ultimately willing

28:48.000 --> 28:50.333
to share me
with my career.

28:50.333 --> 28:52.208
And if I'm forced
to choose --

28:52.208 --> 28:55.375
okay, you two,
enough of the corporate talk.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.041
The demonstration's
beginning.

28:58.417 --> 29:02.333
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?

29:02.333 --> 29:04.166
We're about to begin
our cooking demonstration

29:04.166 --> 29:06.208
with our celebrity chef.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.291
Great.

29:12.875 --> 29:14.125
Hello, everyone.

29:14.125 --> 29:15.834
I know I had the pleasure
of meeting a lot of you

29:15.834 --> 29:17.458
yesterday at the reception.

29:17.458 --> 29:20.125
But in the event that I haven't,
I'm Andrew Browning,

29:20.125 --> 29:22.125
and I'll be your chef
for the evening.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.166
He's so comfortable
in front of an audience.

29:31.166 --> 29:34.041
He has to be. He's in front
of crowds all the time.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.375
Andrew is just the best.

29:35.375 --> 29:39.208
You know, he was offered
his own television show.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.542
Very lucrative deal.
Turned it down.

29:41.542 --> 29:43.208
Why?

29:43.208 --> 29:45.375
He said he'd rather spend time
with his son.

29:47.375 --> 29:49.583
Andrew would like you
to assist him

29:49.583 --> 29:51.250
in his cooking
demonstration.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.583
No, no.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.667
I can't even make macaroni
and cheese out of a box.

29:54.667 --> 29:56.208
Johnny, you should go.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.792
It's good exposure.

29:57.792 --> 29:58.834
No,
it'll be a disaster.

29:58.834 --> 29:59.875
Go ahead,
you'll be fine.

29:59.875 --> 30:02.250
It'll be fine.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.083
Okay.

30:07.083 --> 30:09.875
I always like to have a diner
assist me in the preparations.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.375
So with that, a warm welcome
for miss Johnny prentis.

30:13.709 --> 30:15.750
Is this getting back at me
for spilling wine on you?

30:15.750 --> 30:16.917
What,
big corporate exec,

30:16.917 --> 30:18.750
afraid of speaking
in front of a few people?

30:18.750 --> 30:19.959
It's not a boardroom.

30:19.959 --> 30:23.083
First, I'd like to show you
how to make the dessert

30:23.083 --> 30:25.458
that you just enjoyed,
my creamy caramel torte.

30:25.458 --> 30:28.500
I've got some sugar melting
on the stove for the caramel.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.834
And in just a moment,

30:30.834 --> 30:32.417
Johnny, I'd like you
to turn the mixer on.

30:47.583 --> 30:50.250
Well,
it could have been worse.
How?

30:50.250 --> 30:51.500
You could have burned down
the whole place.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.583
You know what --

30:53.583 --> 30:54.917
no, no, no, no.

30:54.917 --> 30:56.709
You are not leaving me
up here alone.

30:56.709 --> 30:58.333
I am sorry.
I am so sorry about --

30:58.333 --> 31:00.125
please just let me go back
to my seat.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.458
Let's just start over?

31:26.291 --> 31:29.291
I've never been
so embarrassed.

31:29.291 --> 31:30.959
I told you I can't cook.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.291
Which is why
we go out to eat.

31:34.709 --> 31:39.041
Look at the bright side --
they will remember you.

31:41.709 --> 31:43.208
Um, everyone?

31:43.208 --> 31:45.000
Everyone,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.166
but I was hoping
just to take a moment

31:47.166 --> 31:49.333
to make
a special announcement.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.166
First, I think we owe
a round of applause

31:52.166 --> 31:54.166
to our master chef
of the evening,

31:54.166 --> 31:55.417
Mr. Andrew Browning,

31:55.417 --> 31:58.709
for that fabulous meal
he prepared...

31:58.709 --> 32:01.000
With a beating.

32:01.959 --> 32:04.500
And I would be remiss
if I didn't mention

32:04.500 --> 32:07.917
the fabulous show put on
by miss Johnny prentis

32:07.917 --> 32:10.375
during the cooking
demonstration.

32:17.083 --> 32:21.208
But now business.

32:21.208 --> 32:23.083
Thomas Jenkins and I
have known each other

32:23.083 --> 32:24.917
for over 20 years.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.583
But we've been two ships
in the night

32:26.583 --> 32:27.917
when it comes to work.

32:27.917 --> 32:31.709
Well, I'm pleased to announce
that for the very first time,

32:31.709 --> 32:35.041
we've been able to solidify
a deal to work together.

32:35.041 --> 32:38.917
As of Monday morning,
we will be joining forces

32:38.917 --> 32:42.458
and taking over
Stafford telecom.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.667
To us.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.417
You've got a great team.

32:52.417 --> 32:54.417
Thanks a lot.
Very impressed.

33:00.709 --> 33:02.250
Can I pour you some?

33:02.250 --> 33:04.166
Thank you. I'll pour.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.750
Okay. Sure.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.542
Everything's upside down.

33:10.041 --> 33:11.542
I know this is tough.

33:11.542 --> 33:14.375
It's not the only job
out there.

33:14.375 --> 33:18.125
The entire industry knows
you're a financial genius.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.792
So I guarantee you,
this time next week,

33:20.792 --> 33:22.917
you'll be flooded
with offers.

33:24.250 --> 33:27.417
I humiliated myself in a roomful
of corporate executives.

33:27.417 --> 33:28.542
And I'm finished.

33:28.542 --> 33:30.834
I don't even know
what to say to Milton.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.959
I mean,
Stafford was his baby.

33:33.959 --> 33:36.834
He took me from
financial consultant to c.F.O.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.917
He trusted me
with his company.

33:38.917 --> 33:41.250
And I lost it.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.792
No, you didn't.

33:42.792 --> 33:45.000
Stafford was already vulnerable,
and you know that.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.917
And I'm guessing
that Debra

33:46.917 --> 33:48.291
had her sights set
on the company

33:48.291 --> 33:50.375
long before you
and Thomas Jenkins

33:50.375 --> 33:51.458
entered the picture.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.542
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

33:55.583 --> 33:58.917
Well...

33:58.917 --> 34:01.250
I have something
that might.

34:05.375 --> 34:06.542
Johnny, I told you

34:06.542 --> 34:08.166
I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

34:08.166 --> 34:11.458
What,
this is your idea of talk?

34:11.458 --> 34:13.625
You're proposing to me?

34:13.625 --> 34:16.291
Johnny, we've been seeing
each other for a while now,

34:16.291 --> 34:18.125
and...

34:18.125 --> 34:21.792
I think it's time
we take that next...

34:21.792 --> 34:23.041
Logical step.

34:23.041 --> 34:26.000
The next logical step?

34:26.000 --> 34:29.333
Let's face it.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.500
We're at a stage
in our lives

34:31.500 --> 34:33.166
where we have to start planning
for our future.

34:33.166 --> 34:35.208
And I think

34:35.208 --> 34:37.875
that this is gonna be great
for us and our careers.

34:37.875 --> 34:42.125
We have the same goals,
the same aspirations.

34:42.125 --> 34:45.291
And, honestly,
an engagement to me right now

34:45.291 --> 34:48.875
is the perfect political
maneuver for you to make.

34:52.041 --> 34:57.083
Christopher, marriage
isn't a political maneuver,

34:57.083 --> 34:59.083
or at least
it shouldn't be.

34:59.083 --> 35:01.500
We're not teenagers anymore,
Johnny.

35:01.500 --> 35:06.166
A solid marriage isn't based
on passion or romance.

35:06.166 --> 35:09.875
It's about
a strong foundation

35:09.875 --> 35:12.792
for a good,
productive life together.

35:16.458 --> 35:20.125
I'm sorry, but I-I think
it should be more than that.

35:23.291 --> 35:27.375
Come on, you're too old
to want the fairy tale still.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.208
It's not a fairy tale.

35:29.208 --> 35:32.875
I mean, marriage isn't
a business proposition.

35:32.875 --> 35:35.125
I mean, besides, I --

35:35.125 --> 35:37.750
Marriage isn't even
in my plan right now.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.417
I have to be honest,
Johnny,

35:39.417 --> 35:43.750
this is where I'm at
in my life, and...

35:43.750 --> 35:46.250
If we're not
gonna move forward,

35:46.250 --> 35:49.792
I think I might have to look
for someone who is.

36:00.166 --> 36:04.083
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that girl.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.917
Thank you
for your honesty.

36:17.834 --> 36:20.333
Thank you.

36:29.291 --> 36:32.000
Bit chilly to be outside
tonight.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.709
Yes, it is.

36:33.709 --> 36:35.625
Is that your friend
who just left?

36:35.625 --> 36:38.709
He's going home.

36:38.709 --> 36:40.333
Well,
I hope everything's okay.

36:40.333 --> 36:42.834
I ruined your cooking
demonstration,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.083
lost the company,

36:44.083 --> 36:47.291
and I got dumped,
all in the span of a few hours.

36:47.291 --> 36:50.125
So, really,
it's becoming a bang-up day.

36:51.291 --> 36:52.959
Well, I'm sorry.

36:52.959 --> 36:56.792
As for the demonstration,
well, you did spice it up a bit.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.625
That's an understatement.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.208
As for being dumped,

37:03.208 --> 37:06.375
it could put a dent
in one's self-esteem.

37:08.709 --> 37:11.375
You know, I think "dumped"
is too strong of a word.

37:11.375 --> 37:14.542
It was more of
a mutual walkaway.

37:14.542 --> 37:17.500
You know,
I always knew he wasn't...

37:17.500 --> 37:19.166
The one.

37:19.166 --> 37:22.333
I feel so...Ridiculous,

37:22.333 --> 37:25.083
like I'm some
16-year-old girl

37:25.083 --> 37:26.834
planning
my Rose-colored future.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.000
Not ridiculous.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.166
It's actually nice

37:30.166 --> 37:33.625
to find someone
who still believes in love.

37:35.834 --> 37:40.500
Well, I hope everything
turns out the way you want.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.792
It will.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.667
Yeah, just as soon as I pick up
my self-esteem.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.500
You strike me as a person

37:46.500 --> 37:49.166
who will bounce back
rather quickly.

37:49.166 --> 37:52.333
Good night,
miss prentis.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.208
Good night,
Mr. Browning.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.875
So, now that we've gone
public with the merger,

37:59.875 --> 38:02.875
I suppose you want to begin
some reorganization?

38:02.875 --> 38:04.458
I already had that
in the works

38:04.458 --> 38:06.834
way before you crossed
that final "t".

38:06.834 --> 38:07.875
Of course you did.

38:07.875 --> 38:10.375
Are you gonna retain
any of the Stafford group?

38:10.375 --> 38:12.000
I really haven't
considered anything.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.917
Got any ideas?
Well...

38:13.917 --> 38:15.750
Thank you.
Yep.

38:15.750 --> 38:18.917
Yes, Johnny prentis.
I'm in room 1408.

38:18.917 --> 38:20.083
Sure.

38:20.083 --> 38:22.208
One second.
Okay.

38:24.375 --> 38:27.041
Anyway, um...

38:27.041 --> 38:30.375
Johnny,
this is my third message.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.458
Please call me back asap.

38:32.458 --> 38:33.625
Thank you for checking.

38:33.625 --> 38:35.083
Okay.

38:36.291 --> 38:38.750
Were you able to
get any sleep?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.250
A little.

38:40.250 --> 38:43.083
I spent a lot of time
thinking about my next move.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.375
You know, I'm curious.

38:44.375 --> 38:46.291
How did you manage to pull off
the takeover?

38:46.291 --> 38:48.083
I keep running the numbers
in my head,

38:48.083 --> 38:50.083
and I don't see
where the weaknesses were.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.709
There were none,
actually.

38:51.709 --> 38:54.417
That's how Stafford ended up
on my radar in the first place.

38:54.417 --> 38:57.000
I heard that you were courting
Thomas Jenkins,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.750
so I approached him
and de a better offer.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.333
Well, we wanted the deal
in place

39:02.333 --> 39:03.750
before Milton found out

39:03.750 --> 39:05.792
that Stafford
was out of his control.

39:05.792 --> 39:08.792
Right.
And he knows now.

39:08.792 --> 39:12.417
Well, I called him myself
last night.

39:12.417 --> 39:16.542
Dear, you're still so young
and so talented.

39:16.542 --> 39:17.959
In another few years,

39:17.959 --> 39:20.792
things like this
will just roll of your back.

39:20.792 --> 39:24.291
How many times have you been
through something like this?

39:24.291 --> 39:27.375
More than I can count.

39:27.375 --> 39:30.291
Listen, you and I
will sit together

39:30.291 --> 39:31.792
before the end
of this conference,

39:31.792 --> 39:33.208
and we'll discuss
your plans.

39:33.208 --> 39:35.625
I-I'm sure I can make a few
phone calls on your behalf.

39:35.625 --> 39:38.125
Thank you,
and, Debra...

39:38.125 --> 39:42.625
I have to admit,
your plan was brilliant.

39:42.625 --> 39:47.041
Thank you.
I think so.

39:49.834 --> 39:52.834
That was quite an exciting
cooking demonstration

39:52.834 --> 39:53.875
you gave yesterday.

39:53.875 --> 39:55.500
Yeah,
it could have been worse.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.792
Yeah, she could have burned down
the building.

40:00.333 --> 40:01.834
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

40:01.834 --> 40:03.834
Sure.

40:03.834 --> 40:06.500
Feeling any better today?

40:07.875 --> 40:11.667
No, I'm --
I'm a little on edge.

40:11.667 --> 40:14.667
Well,
anything I can do?

40:16.667 --> 40:18.500
Nothing I can think of.

40:18.500 --> 40:21.166
Come on.
I like a good challenge.

40:21.166 --> 40:23.834
Unless, of course,
you need to leave.

40:26.834 --> 40:31.166
Actually, I don't have to be
anywhere today.

40:31.166 --> 40:33.834
But I'm sure you do,
and --

40:33.834 --> 40:35.834
not really.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.333
Plus, I'd like to see
if it's possible

40:37.333 --> 40:41.125
to be within 100 yards of you
and not be in mortal danger.

40:41.125 --> 40:44.208
Yeah, no promises
on the "mortal danger" part.

40:44.208 --> 40:45.709
Yeah, nothing special.

40:45.709 --> 40:49.041
Just a drive out to
my folks' house in the country.

40:49.041 --> 40:51.375
Plus, I need to save them
from my son.

40:54.583 --> 40:58.875
Yeah, I would really enjoy
a ride in the country.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.709
Well, all right, then.
Shall we?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.667
Okay.

41:22.625 --> 41:25.291
I think I was here
yesterday -- on the tour.

41:25.291 --> 41:27.458
You must have tried
some of the wine.

41:27.458 --> 41:28.583
Yeah, it was great.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.500
Your parents live here?
They own it.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
You must have seen them here
yesterday.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.041
Well,
with wine that good,

41:34.041 --> 41:36.583
they must be doing very well
for themselves.

41:36.583 --> 41:39.250
Well, you'd think so,
but, no.

41:39.250 --> 41:42.500
It certainly has
its other advantages.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.583
Hi, dad!

41:43.583 --> 41:46.333
Hey, champ!

41:48.166 --> 41:50.208
Luke,
this is my friend Johnny.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.083
Johnny,
this is my son, Luke.

41:52.083 --> 41:54.875
Hi. Why do you have
a boy's name?

41:54.875 --> 41:58.417
When you work for all men,
it comes in handy sometimes.

41:58.417 --> 42:00.417
Didn't you destroy dad's
demonstration kitchen

42:00.417 --> 42:01.500
last night?

42:01.500 --> 42:04.417
Yes, that was me.

42:04.417 --> 42:07.000
See, dad,
if I was your assistant,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.500
everything
would have been fine.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.375
Yeah, 
he's probably right.

42:12.542 --> 42:13.792
Where are your grandparents,
champ?

42:13.792 --> 42:17.125
In the aging room,
come on!

42:17.125 --> 42:18.333
Shall we?

42:18.333 --> 42:20.792
Okay.

42:20.792 --> 42:23.250
446.

42:23.250 --> 42:26.250
Okay.
325.

42:26.250 --> 42:28.083
Grandma, grandpa,
guess what.

42:28.083 --> 42:30.291
Dad's here, and he brought
a girl with him.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.917
Got a girl with him?

42:35.667 --> 42:37.458
Hello, honey, I didn't think
you were coming today.

42:37.458 --> 42:39.542
I thought
you had to work.

42:39.542 --> 42:43.417
No, no. Mom, dad, this is
my friend Johnny prentis.

42:43.417 --> 42:46.792
Johnny, these are my parents,
Paul and Sophia Browning.

42:46.792 --> 42:48.583
It's nice to meet you.
Hi.

42:48.583 --> 42:50.166
Nice to meet you, too.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.000
Welcome
to our little winery.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.083
I've never met anyone
who's owned a winery before.

42:55.083 --> 42:57.667
Well, we own it
for the time being.
Dad.

42:57.667 --> 43:00.333
We'd love to have you stay
for dinner. Can you?

43:00.333 --> 43:02.709
...no.

43:02.709 --> 43:05.959
I have a seminar at 5:00 P.M.
on new technology.

43:05.959 --> 43:08.834
That sounds boring.
You should stay here with us.

43:08.834 --> 43:12.542
Our grandson is very bright
for his age and quite outspoken.

43:13.667 --> 43:15.083
Please stay.

43:15.083 --> 43:18.667
You know what? A home-cooked
meal sounds perfect.

43:18.667 --> 43:19.750
Great.

43:19.750 --> 43:21.709
Can I show her
the grape crusher?

43:21.709 --> 43:24.875
Sure. Luke's gonna be
a master winemaker some day.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.583
Follow me.

43:28.583 --> 43:31.291
I would run if I were you,
or you'll never catch him.

43:31.291 --> 43:33.625
Will you --

43:33.625 --> 43:34.709
I'll catch up with you.

43:34.709 --> 43:36.208
Okay.

43:36.208 --> 43:38.709
H-Hold on, Luke!

43:38.709 --> 43:41.208
Mom, dad, stop.

43:41.208 --> 43:43.041
I didn't say a word.

43:43.041 --> 43:44.208
I didn't say anything.

43:44.208 --> 43:48.250
You two do silent louder
than anybody I know.

43:52.875 --> 43:55.250
So, I had a very pleasant
and professional conversation

43:55.250 --> 43:56.583
with Mr. Henfield.

43:56.583 --> 43:57.750
Yeah?

43:57.750 --> 44:00.500
I've always said Milton
is a very classy guy.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.875
He's not a stupid man.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.041
He sees the value of what
we're trying to do here.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.875
So, is he gonna retire?

44:04.875 --> 44:07.458
He says he wants to spend
more time with his family.

44:07.458 --> 44:09.709
And with
that golden parachute,

44:09.709 --> 44:11.917
he and his family are gonna have
quite a nice time.

44:11.917 --> 44:13.792
Yeah, I'll say.

44:13.792 --> 44:14.959
I'm happy for him.

44:14.959 --> 44:16.125
Whoa!

44:16.125 --> 44:18.417
Careful, Cruella.
You gonna lose your edge?

44:18.417 --> 44:19.542
Nonsense.

44:19.542 --> 44:22.417
You know me.
I always find a win/win.

44:22.417 --> 44:23.458
Speaking of which,

44:23.458 --> 44:26.208
Milton is emphatically
in favor of...

44:26.208 --> 44:28.834
The other matter
we've been discussing.

44:28.834 --> 44:31.834
Well, good.
And how about you?

44:31.834 --> 44:34.291
I haven't decided yet.

44:34.291 --> 44:37.291
Well, here is to...

44:37.291 --> 44:39.750
Bigger and better.

44:39.750 --> 44:40.917
Indeed.

44:46.291 --> 44:48.083
Sophia,
this pasta is amazing.

44:48.083 --> 44:50.542
I can see where Andrew
got his cooking chops.

44:50.542 --> 44:52.583
Well, thank you.

44:52.583 --> 44:55.125
I'd love to take credit
for his talent.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.000
But, honestly,
he taught me.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.667
I think he became a chef

44:59.667 --> 45:01.458
because I was
such a terrible cook.

45:01.458 --> 45:03.458
Come on, mom.
Your cooking's not that bad.

45:03.458 --> 45:04.750
Well,
thank you, son,

45:04.750 --> 45:06.625
but you know
I could barely boil water.

45:06.625 --> 45:08.291
Remember the year
mother served us

45:08.291 --> 45:09.834
a raw Turkey
for Thanksgiving?

45:09.834 --> 45:11.333
Great, Paul, thank you
for bringing that up.

45:11.333 --> 45:14.250
We spent the next three days
in bed

45:14.250 --> 45:15.500
with food poisoning!

45:15.500 --> 45:18.834
Okay, okay,
but you and dad

45:18.834 --> 45:21.500
did teach me everything I know
about wine.

45:21.500 --> 45:24.125
I had an older sister,
and she learned to cook,

45:24.125 --> 45:26.125
but my father
was determined

45:26.125 --> 45:28.458
that I would become
the winemaker.

45:28.458 --> 45:32.166
Well, I haven't enjoyed a glass
of wine more.

45:32.166 --> 45:34.500
That's our reserve Merlot.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.834
Andrew always pairs it
with this dish.

45:36.834 --> 45:39.083
Well, I can taste why.

45:43.834 --> 45:46.625
I don't normally eat cobbler,
but that was delicious.

45:46.625 --> 45:47.750
Dad taught grandma
to make it.

45:47.750 --> 45:50.333
It's the only thing
she knows how to make.

45:51.500 --> 45:53.041
Sometimes she makes it
three times a day.

45:54.709 --> 45:58.375
All right, champ, go help
grandma with the dishes?

45:58.375 --> 45:59.709
Roger that.

45:59.709 --> 46:02.333
So...I'll see you later,
Johnny?

46:02.333 --> 46:06.834
Um...sure, Luke.

46:13.166 --> 46:14.500
Sorry about my family.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.542
They can be
a little overzealous.

46:16.542 --> 46:19.375
No. No, it's sweet.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.125
Yeah, Luke and I don't get
to spend enough time up here.

46:24.125 --> 46:27.625
It's the reason I took the guest
chef spot at the resort.

46:27.625 --> 46:30.500
Luke gets an extra week
with his grandparents,

46:30.500 --> 46:32.166
and I get to check in
on them.

46:36.542 --> 46:39.709
Andrew,
can I ask you a question?

46:39.709 --> 46:41.083
Fire away.

46:41.083 --> 46:42.959
What did your father mean

46:42.959 --> 46:46.750
when he said they own the winery
for the time being?

46:46.750 --> 46:49.417
Are they selling?

46:49.417 --> 46:51.709
Yeah,
they don't want to,

46:51.709 --> 46:56.417
but the vineyard's been losing
money for the last few years.

46:56.417 --> 46:59.083
They can't seem to stop
the bleeding.

46:59.083 --> 47:01.417
And they might have to get out
while they can.

47:01.417 --> 47:03.917
One of the big
wine conglomerates --

47:03.917 --> 47:08.917
"factories," dad calls them --
has offered to buy the land.

47:08.917 --> 47:11.500
Well, what about
the family label?

47:11.500 --> 47:15.667
Well, I suppose,
like any small

47:15.667 --> 47:21.208
family-run businesses of today,
it'll just disappear.

47:22.875 --> 47:24.792
Come here.
I want to show you something.

47:27.291 --> 47:29.500
It's beautiful out here.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.417
You should see it
in season,

47:31.417 --> 47:33.834
when the vines
aren't dormant,

47:33.834 --> 47:36.125
covered with leaves
and grapes.

47:36.125 --> 47:38.709
A lot of fond memories
as a child growing up here.

47:40.625 --> 47:43.875
You don't seem all that
comfortable around children.

47:45.041 --> 47:48.041
I haven't spent a lot of time
around children.

47:48.041 --> 47:50.000
It's a communication
thing.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.125
You just use smaller words
and try to be gentler

47:53.125 --> 47:55.834
and more understanding
of their feelings.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.875
I've spent
the past 10 years

47:58.875 --> 48:02.166
training all the gentleness
and understanding out of me.

48:02.166 --> 48:04.959
Not great traits to have
in the business world.

48:04.959 --> 48:07.208
Yeah, well,
at least you recognize it.

48:07.208 --> 48:09.458
Most people
grow up unhappy,

48:09.458 --> 48:11.834
not knowing what they want
in the first place.

48:11.834 --> 48:14.375
Well, I've never really had
a problem with that.

48:14.375 --> 48:18.000
I've always been very clear
about what I want in my life.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.875
there'll be other jobs.

48:19.875 --> 48:21.125
I know.

48:23.250 --> 48:27.583
So, how long has your family
owned the winery?

48:27.583 --> 48:33.500
Well, my mom's grandfather
founded it in 1925.

48:33.500 --> 48:36.166
My dad had a vineyard.

48:36.166 --> 48:38.208
Well, he merged it with mom
when they married.

48:38.208 --> 48:41.000
I wish there was more
I could do.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.041
They don't willingly
accept help from me.

48:44.041 --> 48:47.792
Your parents have principles.
It's a good thing.

48:54.500 --> 48:58.834
I should...
Check on Luke.

49:01.291 --> 49:02.709
Right.

49:08.041 --> 49:10.375
Thank you again
for a wonderful day.

49:10.375 --> 49:12.208
It was very thoughtful
of you.

49:12.208 --> 49:13.583
Well, we all enjoyed it.

49:13.583 --> 49:16.291
I just hope we can do it again
before you leave.

49:18.750 --> 49:19.834
No, it's okay.

49:21.917 --> 49:24.583
I'm -- I know it's none
of my business,

49:24.583 --> 49:27.583
but early in my career,
I was a management consultant,

49:27.583 --> 49:30.041
and I helped out
a lot of small businesses.

49:30.041 --> 49:31.750
Would you
and your parents mind

49:31.750 --> 49:34.041
if I took a look
at the winery's financials?

49:34.041 --> 49:35.208
I-It wouldn't cost you
anything.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.291
Really?

49:36.291 --> 49:37.750
Yeah.
That would be
incredibly nice.

49:37.750 --> 49:38.959
They would really
appreciate that.

49:38.959 --> 49:40.792
Sure.

49:40.792 --> 49:42.959
But don't you need to be getting
back to Los Angeles?

49:44.333 --> 49:48.417
I should, but I'm not ready
to face my boss just yet.

49:48.417 --> 49:50.750
Or the inevitable
next step.

49:50.750 --> 49:52.333
I think a few extra days
in wine country

49:52.333 --> 49:55.333
could be
just what I need.

49:55.333 --> 49:59.333
Yeah, well, the last 24 hours
have been a bit hectic.

49:59.333 --> 50:02.166
Yes.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.166
But the last eight hours

50:04.166 --> 50:07.166
have actually been
quite enjoyable.

50:08.792 --> 50:12.959
Listen, about my parents --
I know you want to help,

50:12.959 --> 50:15.834
but it seems like you got a lot
on your plate right now.

50:15.834 --> 50:17.000
No.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.792
No, it's actually --
it's perfect.

50:18.792 --> 50:20.792
It gives me something else
to focus on,

50:20.792 --> 50:22.959
something worthwhile.

50:22.959 --> 50:26.458
Well, all right, then.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

50:26.458 --> 50:28.667
Great.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.500
Just tell us what you need,

50:32.500 --> 50:33.959
and we'll make sure
you have it.

50:33.959 --> 50:36.667
Thank you so much for offering
to look into things.

50:36.667 --> 50:37.667
It means so much.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.959
Hi, Johnny.

50:39.959 --> 50:44.625
Hello, Luke.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.458
You can ask me any question,
and I'll answer it.

50:46.458 --> 50:47.792
I'm an expert.

50:47.792 --> 50:49.750
Well...

50:49.750 --> 50:52.041
All right, well,

50:52.041 --> 50:54.375
um, what I'm gonna need
from you --

50:54.375 --> 50:56.875
and this is
no easy proposition --

50:56.875 --> 50:58.750
is how the winery works --

50:58.750 --> 51:01.959
every process,
every expense.

51:01.959 --> 51:03.583
Well, we should
get started, then.

51:03.583 --> 51:04.875
Right, Mr. Expert?

51:04.875 --> 51:06.834
Roger that,
captain grandpa.

51:06.834 --> 51:10.792
Come on, Johnny.
We'll start in the vineyards.

51:20.083 --> 51:22.500
This time of year,
the vines are pruned

51:22.500 --> 51:25.208
so they'll grow back stronger
in the spring.

51:25.208 --> 51:27.291
The local soil
is very important

51:27.291 --> 51:30.375
in relation to the varieties
of wine we can produce.

51:30.375 --> 51:32.000
This is decomposed
granite soil,

51:32.000 --> 51:33.667
which is best
for making syrah.

51:33.667 --> 51:35.375
But we can grow all kinds
of Bordeaux grapes

51:35.375 --> 51:37.750
because of the wind
of the pacific ocean.

51:37.750 --> 51:41.834
And how do you know that?

51:41.834 --> 51:43.750
Because I have to take over
the winery someday,

51:43.750 --> 51:45.083
and I have to know
everything.

51:54.166 --> 51:55.667
Well, here they are --

51:55.667 --> 51:58.333
all the records
for the last two years.

51:58.333 --> 52:00.500
Great.

52:00.500 --> 52:03.333
And are these all
still active accounts?

52:03.333 --> 52:05.125
Yes, I believe so.

52:09.583 --> 52:12.583
They are all
active accounts.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.709
Hey, dad!

52:15.709 --> 52:18.291
Grandpa wants to show Johnny
the fermentation room.

52:18.291 --> 52:21.125
We'll be right there,
son.

52:21.125 --> 52:24.125
Come on, Johnny.

52:24.125 --> 52:26.959
Go ahead.
I'll put these in the house.

52:26.959 --> 52:29.208
Okay.

52:29.208 --> 52:30.709
Come on, Johnny.

52:30.709 --> 52:32.208
All right.
Grandpa's waiting.

52:32.208 --> 52:34.166
Okay.

52:34.166 --> 52:36.750
We don't want to
keep him waiting.

52:36.750 --> 52:39.208
These are
the fermentation tanks.

52:39.208 --> 52:42.041
This stage of the process
creates heat.

52:42.041 --> 52:43.291
We cool the wine

52:43.291 --> 52:46.583
by setting a proper temperature
in these tanks.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.750
The alcohol
is created naturally

52:48.750 --> 52:50.583
by the addition
of action yeast.

52:50.583 --> 52:53.291
When it's ready, the wine is
transferred into oak barrels

52:53.291 --> 52:54.834
and moved
to the aging room.

52:54.834 --> 52:57.041
This way.

53:00.667 --> 53:02.333
Wine is best aged

53:02.333 --> 53:05.917
at a temperature of
between 55 and 58 degrees.

53:05.917 --> 53:08.875
Extreme heat and cold
is very detrimental

53:08.875 --> 53:10.583
to the wine during aging.

53:10.583 --> 53:13.792
We use oak barrels for control
of the oxidation.

53:13.792 --> 53:16.709
Excessive oxidation causes
the wine to turn bitter.

53:16.709 --> 53:18.208
And you know this because?

53:18.208 --> 53:20.125
Everyone knows that.
Come on.

53:25.959 --> 53:27.792
That smells amazing.

53:27.792 --> 53:29.125
What are you
looking for?

53:29.125 --> 53:30.625
My pen.
I just had it.

53:37.959 --> 53:39.291
You found it.

53:39.291 --> 53:40.792
Thank you.

53:40.792 --> 53:42.625
Try this.

53:44.709 --> 53:47.375
It's delicious.

53:47.375 --> 53:51.375
A little spicy but...Delicious.

53:51.375 --> 53:53.583
It's not that spicy.

53:53.583 --> 53:57.083
It's spicy.

53:57.083 --> 53:58.667
Since this is your job,

53:58.667 --> 54:01.041
do you ever get tired
of cooking?

54:01.041 --> 54:02.792
It's never really felt
like a job.

54:02.792 --> 54:04.750
I enjoy doing it.

54:04.750 --> 54:08.667
It makes people happy.
What more can I ask for?

54:10.333 --> 54:12.333
That's funny.

54:12.333 --> 54:13.667
What's funny?

54:13.667 --> 54:16.208
Your mom and dad said the exact
same thing about the winery.

54:16.208 --> 54:18.959
Well, that's because they enjoy
their lives very much.

54:24.500 --> 54:28.166
Okay, no problem.

54:28.166 --> 54:29.667
so you're still alive.

54:29.667 --> 54:32.041
I'm sorry
I didn't call you earlier.

54:32.041 --> 54:33.250
I just didn't know
what to say.

54:33.250 --> 54:34.667
Well, anything
would have been appreciated.

54:34.667 --> 54:36.083
Do you have any idea
the kind of pandemonium

54:36.083 --> 54:38.125
that's been going on
around here?

54:38.125 --> 54:40.208
Milton's been
trying to reach you.

54:40.208 --> 54:42.208
I don't even
want to think about it.

54:42.208 --> 54:43.875
Look, I actually called
for a favor.

54:43.875 --> 54:46.250
Of course you did.
What do you need?

54:46.250 --> 54:49.125
Do you remember the old files
from the consulting firm?

54:49.125 --> 54:51.375
Yes.
Do you happen to know
where they are?

54:51.375 --> 54:53.875
I'm pretty sure
they're on my hard drive.
Great.

54:53.875 --> 54:55.208
Do you think
you could send me

54:55.208 --> 54:56.709
the beverage-industry study
we did?

54:56.709 --> 54:59.583
And let me guess --
you need them in five minutes.

54:59.583 --> 55:01.667
No.
You can take your time.

55:01.667 --> 55:03.792
10 minutes is fine.

55:03.792 --> 55:05.709
And I'll be back
in a few days

55:05.709 --> 55:08.166
to figure out a game plan
for our future.

55:08.166 --> 55:09.834
Just where are you
right now?

55:09.834 --> 55:12.417
I'm still at the California
oak winery.

55:12.417 --> 55:13.542
With Christopher?

55:13.542 --> 55:17.917
No.
It's a long story.

55:17.917 --> 55:20.458
I'll tell you all about it
when I get back.

55:20.458 --> 55:22.000
Yeah,
you most certainly will.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.208
First we couldn't get you
to go to the vineyard.

55:24.208 --> 55:25.959
Now we can't get you
to come home.

55:25.959 --> 55:27.000
Sounds like some story.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.250
In a few days, Renee.

55:29.250 --> 55:30.583
All right.
Talk to you soon.

55:30.583 --> 55:31.917
Thank you.

55:35.417 --> 55:38.792
Well, I think the little
guy finally went to sleep.

55:38.792 --> 55:41.667
You're really good with him.
You know that?

55:41.667 --> 55:43.291
I try.

55:43.291 --> 55:46.917
But I worry what he's missing
with a single parent.

55:46.917 --> 55:49.583
But you're one parent
who loves him very much.

55:49.583 --> 55:51.625
That counts for a lot.

55:51.625 --> 55:53.000
I hope so.

55:54.583 --> 55:58.625
So...
What's next for you

55:58.625 --> 56:03.166
now that your firm's
being taken over?

56:03.166 --> 56:04.917
I-I don't know, really.

56:04.917 --> 56:09.333
I mean, the transfer of power
is gonna take a couple weeks.

56:09.333 --> 56:13.500
And then I suppose I should
start looking for another job.

56:13.500 --> 56:16.125
Wouldn't you
take some time off?

56:16.125 --> 56:18.458
You got to strike
when the iron's hot.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.792
I've spent 10 years
getting to where I am.

56:20.792 --> 56:24.208
I can't let my career be
derailed by something like this.

56:24.208 --> 56:28.208
You know,
my mother likes to say...

56:28.208 --> 56:31.750
"You can make all the plans
you want.

56:31.750 --> 56:33.750
"But god has made his

56:33.750 --> 56:38.208
and doesn't feel the need
to check in with you."

56:41.125 --> 56:42.792
And do you think that?

56:44.875 --> 56:48.375
When I married Meredith...

56:52.834 --> 56:55.166
...i made all these plans

56:55.166 --> 56:58.333
for us to spend the rest
of our lives together,

56:58.333 --> 57:01.166
and with Luke.

57:03.875 --> 57:07.000
And then one day,
she's diagnosed with cancer.

57:09.667 --> 57:11.500
And all those plans
meant nothing.

57:11.500 --> 57:13.166
I'm so sorry.

57:13.166 --> 57:15.333
One day,

57:15.333 --> 57:18.667
I could see my whole life
stretched out in front of me.

57:18.667 --> 57:21.542
And the next...

57:23.041 --> 57:26.166
...i couldn't see two feet
in front of my face.

57:28.208 --> 57:29.875
What did you do?

57:32.083 --> 57:35.083
Put one foot in front
of the other.

57:35.083 --> 57:37.917
Took care of Luke...

57:37.917 --> 57:40.750
And Meredith.

57:45.834 --> 57:49.166
Tried to have faith.

57:53.875 --> 57:57.041
How do you
hold onto faith

57:57.041 --> 57:59.041
in the midst
of something like that?

57:59.041 --> 58:03.041
What else do you have?

58:05.750 --> 58:07.458
See you in the morning.

58:11.792 --> 58:15.667
Thank you.

58:24.917 --> 58:27.583
So, what'll it be?
Eggs, waffles, omelets?

58:27.583 --> 58:30.291
His omelets are the best.

58:30.291 --> 58:32.792
Well, I'm sure they are.
Surprise me.

58:32.792 --> 58:36.792
But I definitely
want a cup of coffee.

58:36.792 --> 58:40.083
I feel bad that you guys waited
to have breakfast for me.

58:40.083 --> 58:43.291
Breakfast is always
a little later on sundays.

58:43.291 --> 58:45.959
So, will you be
joining us?

58:45.959 --> 58:47.917
Joining you?

58:47.917 --> 58:50.041
For church?
We always go as a family.

58:50.041 --> 58:52.125
Mom.

58:52.125 --> 58:56.375
I-I haven't been to church
in...I don't know how long.

58:56.375 --> 58:57.959
It's your choice,
of course.

58:57.959 --> 59:00.333
Johnny, you don't have to go
to church with us

59:00.333 --> 59:02.125
unless you want to.

59:02.125 --> 59:04.125
I-I'm not really dressed
for it.

59:04.125 --> 59:06.458
Our church
isn't fancy.

59:06.458 --> 59:07.959
You look great.

59:07.959 --> 59:09.208
Like grandma always says,

59:09.208 --> 59:11.542
"the lord isn't looking
at your clothes,

59:11.542 --> 59:13.625
but the person inside 'em."

59:13.625 --> 59:17.333
Well, in that case,

59:17.333 --> 59:18.625
it would be lovely
to join you.

59:19.667 --> 59:22.250
So, what will it be.

59:22.250 --> 59:23.792
I'll have one
of your famous omelets.

59:23.792 --> 59:24.959
Good choice.

59:24.959 --> 59:26.625
Did you hear that,
champ?

59:31.667 --> 59:34.333
It's wonderful that
it worked out so nicely.

59:34.333 --> 59:38.667
I know. It couldn't be
a better day, too.

59:38.667 --> 59:39.834
It's beautiful.

59:39.834 --> 59:41.250
We have...Andrew.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
Hello, Luke!
Good gracious, how you've grown!

59:48.000 --> 59:50.500
Andrew, welcome.
Good to see you again.

59:50.500 --> 59:52.333
Johnny,
this is reverend whitting.

59:52.333 --> 59:55.542
He's been our pastor
since before Andrew was born.

59:55.542 --> 59:58.750
Come on now, you make me sound
as old as methuselah.

59:58.750 --> 01:00:01.250
Well...

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:03.000
This is Johnny prentis.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.250
She's helping us out
at the winery.

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.542
It's nice to meet you.

01:00:06.542 --> 01:00:08.917
It's my pleasure.
It's good to have you here.

01:00:08.917 --> 01:00:10.625
Thank you.

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:14.291
The lord welcomes all those
who wish to listen to the word.

01:00:14.291 --> 01:00:16.542
Of course, then it puts
all the pressure on me

01:00:16.542 --> 01:00:19.375
to make that experience
good enough

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.709
that you'll
want to come back.

01:00:21.709 --> 01:00:23.709
It was a real pleasure
meeting you, Johnny.

01:00:23.709 --> 01:00:24.917
Excuse me.

01:00:24.917 --> 01:00:28.625
Dad, can we play football
after church?

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.375
Absolutely, champ.

01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.041
You in, grandpa?

01:00:32.041 --> 01:00:33.500
I wouldn't miss it.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:36.583
Family tradition.

01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:39.875
Come on, Johnny.
You can sit with me.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:50.709
Nice!
Whoo! All right!
Great pass!

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.250
All right,
here you go, dad.

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:54.583
Ooh. Okay.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.000
Here, Luke!

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.750
You're gonna fumble!
Aah!

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:03.667
Hey,
no fair tickling!

01:01:03.667 --> 01:01:05.709
Hey, 15-yard penalty
for tickling!

01:01:05.709 --> 01:01:08.291
Nice tackle, Luke!

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:10.959
Nice tackle, buddy.

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.166
Thank you.

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:14.166
Whoo!
I love you, bud!

01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:15.583
I love you, too, daddy!

01:01:15.583 --> 01:01:17.917
Love you more!
Nuh-unh!

01:01:17.917 --> 01:01:20.166
Well, I'm gonna go make
some sandwiches.

01:01:20.166 --> 01:01:22.458
I've got some ham
that's calling my name.

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:25.166
I'll make the sandwiches.
You make some lemonade.
Okay.

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:26.667
What about them?

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:29.458
They'll come in
when they're hungry.

01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:33.166
We are very appreciative
of any help you can give us.

01:01:37.583 --> 01:01:39.083
Your parents still do
their accounting

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.417
the old-fashioned way.

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:45.291
Dad thinks computers are
the demise of all mankind.

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.959
Winemaking hasn't changed
that much,

01:01:47.959 --> 01:01:50.291
so why should
the accounting?

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:53.208
Well, you know, I never really
gave much thought

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:55.542
to the technicalities
of winemaking.

01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:57.709
I always just popped the cork
and drank.

01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:02.041
And now you know more
than you wanted to,

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:03.709
thanks to the little guy.

01:02:05.041 --> 01:02:07.417
Well,
Luke is a wonderful child.

01:02:07.417 --> 01:02:09.125
Yeah, he's grown quite fond
of you.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:15.500
I'm still so awkward
around him.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.667
Well,
you're getting better.
Am I?

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:22.500
No.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.041
So, what do your future plans
look like?

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:31.583
I don't know.

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:36.667
For the first time in my life,
I simply do not know.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:38.500
Hey, dad!

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.208
Can you come here a minute?!
Grandpa and I need you!

01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:44.500
Well, I better go check
on that...

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:46.333
Wonderful child.

01:02:49.083 --> 01:02:52.375
Dad, will you hurry up?

01:03:03.166 --> 01:03:05.000
Can I get you anything?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.500
No. No, I'm fine.

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:13.083
Whatever it is,
you can ask me.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.291
I-I don't know.

01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:22.291
It's -- it's probably none
of my business, but...

01:03:24.125 --> 01:03:29.166
I was just wondering
when Andrew's wife died.

01:03:29.166 --> 01:03:31.834
Five years ago.

01:03:31.834 --> 01:03:34.667
He hardly had time to adjust
to the news,

01:03:34.667 --> 01:03:36.291
it happened so suddenly.

01:03:36.291 --> 01:03:38.417
Meredith started
feeling ill.

01:03:38.417 --> 01:03:40.750
They diagnosed her
with leukemia.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:44.583
And it was only a few months
later that we lost her.

01:03:44.583 --> 01:03:46.834
The saddest part was that
Luke was so little,

01:03:46.834 --> 01:03:48.083
he barely remembers her.

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:53.583
Poor little guy.

01:03:53.583 --> 01:03:56.417
Andrew threw himself
into his work.

01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:59.250
Part passion,
part escape.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.417
I can understand that.

01:04:01.417 --> 01:04:04.375
I can see that
you two understand a lot

01:04:04.375 --> 01:04:05.667
about each other.

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:08.750
I mean, I don't know
what your situation is.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:13.750
Well, i'm...

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:16.750
Andrew and I...

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:24.667
We're becoming friends.

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:28.000
Sometimes the most obvious
things in life

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.667
are the most difficult
to talk about.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:33.834
Just...

01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:35.667
Don't let opportunities
pass you by

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.834
without a second thought.

01:04:37.834 --> 01:04:40.709
You're much too young
to have regrets.

01:04:42.542 --> 01:04:45.583
If you need anything,
I'm in the house.

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:47.959
Okay, thanks.

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:57.959
So, how do you know
when the grapes are ready?

01:04:57.959 --> 01:04:59.625
By color?

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:01.542
Common misconception.

01:05:01.542 --> 01:05:03.333
My father likes to say,

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:06.917
"the important factors
for making great wine

01:05:06.917 --> 01:05:11.083
"have to do with sugar levels,
acidity of the grapes,

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:12.375
"Berry flavor,

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:15.500
and most importantly,
tannin levels."

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.834
It's all
very technical stuff.

01:05:18.834 --> 01:05:20.709
Yes and no.

01:05:20.709 --> 01:05:24.041
What it all comes down to,
really, is how it tastes.

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:26.583
It's just like everything else
in life.

01:05:26.583 --> 01:05:29.375
It's all about personal taste.

01:05:29.375 --> 01:05:31.917
You know, I need to head back
to the resort,

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:33.291
tie up a few loose ends.

01:05:33.291 --> 01:05:35.208
If you'd like,
I could take you.

01:05:36.542 --> 01:05:38.792
No, I'm almost finished
with my analysis,

01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:41.208
and I want to give
your parents some thoughts.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:43.750
I'm sure your dad
can take me back.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:47.709
So, is there hope?

01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:52.125
I have a few ideas.
Nothing spectacular, I admit.

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.709
Your parents are already
very economical.

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:57.375
But there is always hope.

01:05:57.375 --> 01:06:01.500
There is...Isn't there?

01:06:04.667 --> 01:06:08.166
How about you meet me
at the bar at 7:00?

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:11.709
I'll see you there.

01:06:11.709 --> 01:06:12.792
All right.

01:06:16.083 --> 01:06:17.458
And thank you.

01:06:17.458 --> 01:06:19.333
You're welcome.

01:06:30.917 --> 01:06:33.709
So?
Can we save it?

01:06:33.709 --> 01:06:36.500
Well, let me show you
what I found.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.250
That doesn't sound
very reassuring.

01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:43.000
It absolutely
can be saved.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.583
And some updating of systems
will be a part of it.

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:46.750
But most importantly,

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.583
I think we need to take
the heart of this winery,

01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:52.083
its heritage,
and make that the centerpiece

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:55.166
of a new marketing, pricing,
and distribution campaign.

01:06:55.166 --> 01:06:59.333
Now, what you have here
is something to be savored,

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:01.375
but the key
is your distribution.

01:07:01.375 --> 01:07:04.083
Well,
we have tried to pair

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:06.291
with some more established
vineyards before,

01:07:06.291 --> 01:07:08.458
but we just didn't find
very much interest.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:12.709
Well, I can work with you
on finding a major distributor.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:15.250
How?
You don't live up here.

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:18.667
Well, I could spend
some time up here,

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.417
oversee the changes.

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:22.709
That is,
once you see the specifics,

01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:24.083
if you want me to.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:27.792
I -- I feel certain
that we're gonna want you to.

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:30.166
Good.

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:34.083
Johnny!

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:36.250
Johnny, I've been looking
for you all day.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:37.375
I'm sorry.

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:39.166
I completely forgot
you wanted to talk.

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:41.291
Well, I know you have a lot
on your mind.

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:44.166
Listen, why don't we go inside
and have a drink?

01:07:44.166 --> 01:07:47.625
Well, I'm supposed to be meeting
someone in a little while,

01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:50.000
but, sure,
I could spare a few minutes.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.166
Okay.

01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:57.375
You look like you've made peace
with things.

01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:58.709
I'm working on it.

01:07:58.709 --> 01:08:00.917
I spent
the last 24 hours

01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:03.834
evaluating the holdings
and assets of Stafford

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:06.333
and your plans
to expand the company.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:07.959
I'm proud of my work.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:09.166
You should be.

01:08:09.166 --> 01:08:11.166
Those numbers
were financial gold.

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:13.291
I truly believe
it would have worked.

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.208
Well, thank you.

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:17.709
But it's a moot point,
don't you think?

01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:18.834
Maybe not.

01:08:18.834 --> 01:08:20.500
What do you mean?

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.834
I had every intention
of dismantling

01:08:22.834 --> 01:08:25.207
Stafford upper management
until I saw your plans.

01:08:25.207 --> 01:08:28.500
You are a singularly focused
young woman.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.709
That's why
I want to hire you.

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.834
You want to hire me?
Yes.

01:08:35.834 --> 01:08:37.207
A senior
financial position.

01:08:37.207 --> 01:08:39.207
But you'd be playing
in a much bigger sandbox --

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:40.750
a lot more responsibility
and power

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:41.792
than you had at Stafford.

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:43.457
And you'd be reporting
directly to me.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:45.500
Of course, you'd have to move
to our headquarters

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.082
in San Francisco.

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:50.375
And you're serious?
You want to hire me.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:52.875
I think Thomas put it
this way.

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:54.500
When he saw you,

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.417
he thought that he saw
a reflection of me.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:02.250
That's -- that's amazing.

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.750
Um...

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.582
I mean, I have to talk
to Milton first.

01:09:05.582 --> 01:09:07.000
I don't want him
to think --

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.457
I've already spoken
to Milton.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:10.917
Who do you think gave you
your strongest recommendation?

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:12.875
Look, I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:15.375
I've got to fly to Tokyo
for some meetings.

01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:16.750
Are you in?

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:18.542
Of course.

01:09:18.542 --> 01:09:19.750
Good.

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.207
I'll be back Thursday.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:23.582
We'll work
on getting you settled.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:26.500
I jotted down your offer.
Take a look at it.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.000
Everything's negotiable.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.417
Thank you.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.417
I look forward to working
with you, Johnny.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:34.082
Me, too.
Bye.

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:55.792
Hey, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.

01:09:57.291 --> 01:10:00.458
Hello?
Anybody home?

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:01.625
Hi.

01:10:01.625 --> 01:10:03.959
I just got off the phone
with my mom.

01:10:03.959 --> 01:10:06.166
She is so excited
about your ideas.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:09.834
I haven't heard her this happy
in so long.

01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:13.000
And you're gonna be staying here
for a few months?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.834
I can't.

01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:17.333
Y-You can't what?

01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:21.166
Debra Miller
offered me a job.

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:24.166
It's a very
lucrative deal.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:29.834
Well...that's great.

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:32.375
That's what you wanted,
right?

01:10:32.375 --> 01:10:33.875
Yeah.

01:10:33.875 --> 01:10:37.208
That's everything I've...
Always wanted.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:40.166
Congratulations.

01:10:40.166 --> 01:10:43.333
Thank you.

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:45.333
Your parents...

01:10:45.333 --> 01:10:47.959
They'll understand.

01:10:47.959 --> 01:10:52.834
So,
where's the new job?

01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:55.542
San Francisco.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:59.875
But, you know, I-I can still
consult with your parents.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:02.375
I mean, it would have to be
long-distance, but...

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:05.083
Yeah, of course.

01:11:07.583 --> 01:11:11.750
The reason why I asked you
to meet me here tonight,

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:13.250
away from your family...

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:14.625
You don't need to say it.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:15.792
I don't?

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:23.041
Johnny, whatever...
This is...

01:11:25.166 --> 01:11:27.500
...you know,
we didn't expect it.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:30.667
And obviously...

01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:34.458
Neither of us
have space for...

01:11:34.458 --> 01:11:36.166
Well...

01:11:36.166 --> 01:11:40.041
Maybe it's better
we don't name it.

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.917
Probably.

01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:49.750
So bizarre.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.750
I've only known you
for four days, and yet...

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:57.083
Yeah, it seems like
so much more.

01:11:57.083 --> 01:12:00.083
Yeah.

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:03.750
It's nice to know I can feel
this way about someone,

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:05.500
I suppose.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.750
And scary.

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.917
Terrifying.

01:12:09.917 --> 01:12:12.083
But nice.

01:12:15.291 --> 01:12:18.792
It's not like we're never
gonna see each other again.

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:21.500
You know,
I'm gonna...Help your parents

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:22.917
as much as possible.

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:25.917
Luke's gonna miss you.

01:12:25.917 --> 01:12:28.667
We'll be heading to L.A.
in a few days.

01:12:28.667 --> 01:12:31.917
He's got to get back to school.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.750
I'm gonna miss him, too.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:51.125
Good luck
with your new job.

01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.625
Welcome back.

01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:12.709
You look...Interesting.

01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:14.792
How much wine have you had
in the last week?

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.458
I'm not hung over.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.208
I just haven't
been able to sleep.

01:13:18.208 --> 01:13:20.333
Well, that explains the lack
of sparkle in your eyes.

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.000
I just thought it was
a bad makeup job.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.333
You're sensitive.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:25.375
I try.

01:13:25.375 --> 01:13:26.709
So, what's this big news

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:29.250
you said you couldn't tell me
about over the phone?

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:32.000
You don't waste time.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.375
Well, I learned
from the master. Spill.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:39.834
I've been offered
a senior financial position

01:13:39.834 --> 01:13:41.834
with Debra Miller's
company.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.000
The jerk whose firm
is taking us over?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.417
And I have permission
to take you with me.

01:13:46.417 --> 01:13:48.000
When I say "jerk,"
I do mean that

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.500
in the most affectionate sense
of the word, of course.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:51.542
Of course.

01:13:51.542 --> 01:13:53.750
But you have to move
to San Francisco.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.583
I can be packed
in three minutes.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:58.500
What's with the long face?

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.542
You didn't have to sell yourself
to seven years

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:02.709
of indentured servitude
to this woman, did you?

01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:05.458
No, no, this is a great
opportunity for the both of us.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:06.875
But...

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:10.375
I know this isn't about you
and Christopher.

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:12.750
I could barely get you to go out
to dinner with him

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.166
more than once a week.

01:14:14.166 --> 01:14:17.250
No, there's no
me and Christopher.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.917
There's a guy
in wine country.

01:14:19.917 --> 01:14:23.041
Like a "knight in shining armor
you're attracted to,

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.208
"butterflies
in your stomach,

01:14:24.208 --> 01:14:26.542
don't even want dessert"
kind of guy!

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:28.875
I'm gonna go talk
to Milton.

01:14:28.875 --> 01:14:30.875
Seriously?!
I want details!

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:33.792
There's plenty of time
for that.

01:14:37.041 --> 01:14:39.375
You look happy.

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.875
I thought for sure

01:14:40.875 --> 01:14:43.041
you'd be battening down
the hatches by now.

01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:44.750
You know,
surprisingly enough,

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:47.125
I have never been happier
in my life.

01:14:48.125 --> 01:14:50.083
Have a seat.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:53.000
So, you took the job,
right?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.750
Yes. Thank you
for your recommendation.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.583
You're very welcome.

01:14:58.834 --> 01:15:00.625
You don't look terribly excited
about it.

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.125
No, no.
It's a great opportunity.

01:15:03.125 --> 01:15:05.333
I'd be a fool
not to take it.

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:06.834
Probably.

01:15:06.834 --> 01:15:11.250
You know, I have to ask.
Why are you so happy?

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:12.750
Well, I --

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:16.583
I was panicked at first,
but then I went home

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:20.792
and I had a conversation
with my wife, and I realized...

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:24.083
This is the chance
I've been waiting for.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.792
22 years,

01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:29.667
and I'd almost forgotten
there's a real world out there.

01:15:29.667 --> 01:15:32.458
Right.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:34.834
So, now,
if you will excuse me,

01:15:34.834 --> 01:15:37.250
I have got a tee time
to make.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:39.125
I'm taking up golf.

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:42.083
You know, I've got nothing to do
with the rest of my life

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:43.125
except live!

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.959
Best of luck
on your new job.

01:15:49.959 --> 01:15:51.625
Thank you.

01:16:04.166 --> 01:16:07.041
Well,
it's been a few weeks.

01:16:08.166 --> 01:16:09.959
I almost have everything
in order.

01:16:09.959 --> 01:16:13.083
Just don't take too long.
I've got big plans for you.

01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:14.834
Good thing you have
no personal life,

01:16:14.834 --> 01:16:16.709
'cause you're not gonna have
time for that here.

01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:18.709
You don't waste any time,
do you?

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:21.458
Well, there's precious little
time in life, Johnny.

01:16:21.458 --> 01:16:23.250
We got to make
the most of it.

01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:26.583
If I could work more than
100 hours a week, I'd do it.

01:16:26.583 --> 01:16:30.083
What about
the rest of your life?

01:16:30.083 --> 01:16:33.667
This company is my life.
And now it's your life, too.

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.166
Glad to have you here.

01:16:35.166 --> 01:16:36.291
Thank you.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.291
Where's your bag, champ?

01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:10.333
What's up?
You feeling all right?

01:17:10.333 --> 01:17:14.000
I'm fine. I just thought
she might be here.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.166
Johnny.

01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:22.375
She said she'd come back
to help grandma and grandpa.

01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:25.542
Yeah, well, maybe she just got
tied up with work, sweetheart.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:31.041
Well, you always say,
when we care about people,

01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:32.583
we have to make time.

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:35.417
That's right.

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:38.417
You see, we can't force people
to love us.

01:17:40.458 --> 01:17:44.250
Grab your bag.
Let's go have some fun.

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:45.750
Okay.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.959
Look,
I told you everything.

01:17:53.959 --> 01:17:57.083
So, are ever
gonna talk about the guy?

01:17:57.083 --> 01:18:00.625
There is no guy.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:03.291
I have known you
for far too long

01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:05.667
to buy the lie you're trying to
sell yourself right now.

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:08.375
Some things
just aren't meant to be.

01:18:08.375 --> 01:18:10.500
Well, sometimes we walk away
from things

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.834
because we're just too chicken
to face them.

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:18.458
It wasn't just me, Renee.
He wasn't ready, either.

01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:27.709
Look at you,
Johnny prentis.

01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:29.458
You can take down
mighty corporations,

01:18:29.458 --> 01:18:32.291
but you can't deal
with your feelings for a man.

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:36.458
I'm disappointed in you.

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.875
It's done.
I've made my decision.

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.166
Did you?

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.834
Have a good weekend.

01:18:45.834 --> 01:18:47.625
You, too.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.500
Daddy?

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:16.333
Hey, champ.
I thought you were sleeping.

01:20:16.333 --> 01:20:17.834
I can't sleep.

01:20:19.834 --> 01:20:22.000
Something you
want to talk about?

01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:34.583
Johnny.
She was very nice.

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:37.917
Yeah, she was.

01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:42.583
When is she coming back?

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:49.750
I don't know
if she's ever coming back.

01:20:51.917 --> 01:20:54.750
Come on,
let me tuck you in.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.250
Dad?

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:59.166
Can I just stay here and snuggle
withou a little bit?

01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:02.959
Absolutely.

01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:09.542
Did I ever tell you
about the time

01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:12.041
that grizzly bear chased me
up the tree?

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:14.375
About a thousand times.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:16.542
You want to hear it again?

01:21:16.542 --> 01:21:18.875
No. Not really.

01:21:23.208 --> 01:21:25.834
Hello, Johnny?

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:29.500
Milton was here earlier.

01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.125
Yeah, I saw him.
Nice man.

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:33.291
Seems to be enjoying
his mundane life

01:21:33.291 --> 01:21:34.959
for the past
couple of days.

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:37.834
But then,
to each his own.

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:40.500
They say that's what makes
horse racing.

01:21:42.208 --> 01:21:43.750
Your travel itinerary.

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:46.500
I'm going somewhere?
Yes.

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:49.000
Our Tokyo office is falling
apart at the seams.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.458
You're booked
for a flight tomorrow.

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:52.000
You should be there
for about five days

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.667
to put it back
into order.

01:21:53.667 --> 01:21:56.291
Then there are tickets
for London after that.

01:21:56.291 --> 01:21:57.750
England?

01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:59.583
Yes, there is a meeting
of office managers.

01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.375
You're gonna be there
as my eyes and my ears.

01:22:01.375 --> 01:22:03.500
You can take notes,
use a recorder if you'd like.

01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:05.625
But I expect
a detailed report.

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:09.375
Then you should be heading back
to the states in enough time

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.542
to make the conference

01:22:10.542 --> 01:22:12.333
on sales and distribution
in D.C. next month.

01:22:14.667 --> 01:22:17.166
No.

01:22:17.166 --> 01:22:19.166
No?

01:22:19.166 --> 01:22:21.000
W-What does that mean?

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.333
It means,
"no. I'm not going."

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.083
I quit.

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:28.875
Well, you can't quit.

01:22:28.875 --> 01:22:30.875
People like us
are not quitters.

01:22:30.875 --> 01:22:33.458
In a couple of years,
you'll be just like me!

01:22:36.166 --> 01:22:40.458
No offense,
but that's what I'm afraid of.

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:52.208
Excuse me?

01:22:52.208 --> 01:22:54.709
I'm sorry,
we're not open yet.

01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:57.959
It's okay.
I can wait.

01:22:57.959 --> 01:22:59.542
Johnny!

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:01.166
You should have told us
you were coming!

01:23:01.166 --> 01:23:02.542
I didn't even
know myself.

01:23:02.542 --> 01:23:05.250
I just started driving
and ended up here.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:07.458
Isn't it funny
how that happens sometimes?

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:10.250
I don't if "funny"
is the word I'd use.

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:12.583
I had a feeling you'd find
your way back here.

01:23:12.583 --> 01:23:14.583
You did?

01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:15.875
Call it a mother's
intuition.

01:23:15.875 --> 01:23:18.417
Well,
I just hope I'm not too late.

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:21.625
You know, in life, you may think
you know the outcome.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:24.291
But really, it's all just
one big surprise.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:27.750
I don't like surprises.

01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:30.208
I don't even know
how he feels about me.

01:23:30.208 --> 01:23:33.250
I may have just made
the biggest mistake of my life.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.625
Your job?

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:36.959
I quit.

01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:39.959
I was at Stafford
for 10 years,

01:23:39.959 --> 01:23:41.792
and I barely saw the time
pass me by.

01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:43.250
I didn't want to look up

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:45.667
and realize I'd lost
another 10 years.

01:23:45.667 --> 01:23:47.625
Well, what do you plan
to do now?

01:23:47.625 --> 01:23:53.291
Well, actually, I have a plan
to save your winery.

01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:55.792
I thought you said
it would take some time

01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:57.083
to find a distributor.

01:23:57.083 --> 01:23:58.458
Well, normally, it would.

01:23:58.458 --> 01:24:01.208
But I was staying in a high-end
hotel and corporate resort

01:24:01.208 --> 01:24:03.542
when I first moved
to the bay area.

01:24:03.542 --> 01:24:06.250
They have a small chain
of select hotels worldwide.

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.375
I spoke to the manager,

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.959
who put me in touch
with one of the owners,

01:24:08.959 --> 01:24:10.458
and he was very receptive
to my idea

01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:11.875
of carrying
your wine exclusively.

01:24:11.875 --> 01:24:13.458
Really?

01:24:13.458 --> 01:24:14.458
Yes.

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.625
So as of next year,

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:18.208
they will be using and selling
California oak wines

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:20.291
in all of their resorts
here and abroad.

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.625
We have to go tell
the guys!
How is Andrew?

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:27.291
Well, why don't you come
ask him yourself?

01:24:27.291 --> 01:24:28.500
He's here?

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:31.333
Yeah. He and Luke drove up
for the weekend.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:33.166
It seems things
are a little lonely in L.A.

01:24:33.166 --> 01:24:34.834
I-I don't think
he would want to see me.

01:24:34.834 --> 01:24:36.500
Only one way
to find that out.

01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:41.375
How about the bacon
Mac and cheese tonight?

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:42.709
Lobster Mac.

01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:44.750
What, do you think lobsters
grow on trees?

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:47.375
Dad, think you can afford
a lobster or two.

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:49.875
I have a feeling

01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:51.917
we'll be able to afford
more than that pretty soon.

01:24:55.667 --> 01:24:56.834
You came back!

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.166
Dad, Johnny's back!

01:25:04.166 --> 01:25:06.083
Yeah,
I see that, champ.

01:25:06.083 --> 01:25:08.000
Luke, why don't you and I
go find grandpa

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.542
and tell him that Johnny's here
for a visit?

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:12.583
All right.
I'll see you later, Johnny.

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:15.417
You bet you will.

01:25:20.542 --> 01:25:25.542
You know, for some reason
that escapes me,

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:28.208
Luke has become very close
to you.

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:32.917
I don't want to
see him hurt.

01:25:32.917 --> 01:25:36.500
Your family is very protective
of each other.

01:25:41.041 --> 01:25:42.875
Why are you here?

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:48.542
The night
of the demonstration,

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:52.041
Debra told me that you turned
down the opportunity

01:25:52.041 --> 01:25:54.834
to have your own
television show.

01:25:54.834 --> 01:25:56.750
That's true.

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:59.417
Because you wanted to spend
more time with Luke.

01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:03.750
Yeah,
that about sums it up.

01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:08.458
I never felt that...

01:26:08.458 --> 01:26:11.417
Until now.

01:26:16.625 --> 01:26:19.291
Um...

01:26:19.291 --> 01:26:23.834
There's something
I need to know.

01:26:23.834 --> 01:26:26.917
What's that?

01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:29.417
Do you...

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.792
Did you...

01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:35.834
Miss me?

01:26:35.834 --> 01:26:38.792
Luke missed you
very much.

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:47.291
I'm in love with you,
Andrew Browning,

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:51.583
and I really missed you...
A lot.

01:26:51.583 --> 01:26:53.709
Really?

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:56.000
Really.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.333
I guess I just need to know
how you feel.

01:27:02.834 --> 01:27:03.959
All right.

01:27:03.959 --> 01:27:06.250
Johnny!

01:27:20.625 --> 01:27:23.542
Does that answer
your question?

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:29.417
What's all the ruckus abo--

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.500
Dad?

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.583
Does this mean
you're getting married?

01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:39.875
Luke.

01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:42.667
Well,
that's a good question, son.

01:27:47.417 --> 01:27:50.417
Well? Does it?

01:27:50.417 --> 01:27:53.333
Are you asking?

01:27:53.333 --> 01:27:56.500
Yes, I am.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:01.542
Absolutely...
Positively.

01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:05.208
So, does that mean yes?

01:28:05.208 --> 01:28:07.542
That's a Roger, 10-4,
captain.

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:08.875
All right!
