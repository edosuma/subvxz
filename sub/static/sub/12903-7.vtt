WEBVTT

00:11.612 --> 00:12.578
Alhambra!

00:12.580 --> 00:15.781
We are Boypocalypse Wow!

00:15.783 --> 00:17.649
We are back!

00:17.651 --> 00:19.752
And better than ever!

00:19.754 --> 00:21.787
And here's the one
that started it all.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.456
"Young, Fast, and Firm."

00:56.390 --> 00:58.090
My God!

00:58.092 --> 00:59.892
My God!

01:09.603 --> 01:10.502
Where's Tribeca?

01:10.504 --> 01:12.471
She had to take a personal day.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.273
We get personal days?

01:14.275 --> 01:17.643
I came in when I had meningitis.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.746
Damn. Boypocalypse Wow.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.315
I always looked up to Denarius.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.684
I figured if a black kid
from the suburbs

01:25.686 --> 01:30.222
can be pressured by a creepy
manager into joining a boy band,

01:30.224 --> 01:30.756
so can I.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.558
Listen, don't leave me alone
with Scholls.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.827
She's still a little bitter
about the breakup

01:34.829 --> 01:35.727
and the whole lying

01:35.729 --> 01:38.497
about the baby
we were raising together thing.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.766
I'm sorry, what?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.701
Never mind.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.836
Scholls, what we looking at?

01:43.838 --> 01:46.305
P.T. Cruiser,
Boypocalypse Wow's bad boy.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.539
His t-shirt cannon
malfunctioned,

01:47.541 --> 01:50.642
leaving a fatal amount of space
between his head and his body.

01:50.644 --> 01:51.677
So, where's the head?

01:51.679 --> 01:53.545
On eBay. There was no
"Buy It Now" option,

01:53.547 --> 01:55.781
so we're bidding on it.
Fingers crossed.

01:55.783 --> 01:56.982
Was this an accident?

01:56.984 --> 01:58.684
Absolutely not.

01:58.686 --> 01:59.585
Hi. Jack Pfoopa.

01:59.587 --> 02:03.455
Manager of Boypocalypse Wow,
Boysters on the Half-Shell,

02:03.457 --> 02:04.389
and Sir Ian McKellen.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.525
So, you're saying you don't
think this was an accident?

02:06.527 --> 02:07.759
We've done this routine
800 times.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.696
The boys do their moves,
the girls scream bloody murder,

02:10.698 --> 02:12.731
I get my 80%,
I go home to my parrots.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.966
No, if something went wrong,

02:13.968 --> 02:16.668
somebody <i> wanted</i> this to go wrong.
He's right.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.937
The firing mechanism
on the t-shirt cannon

02:18.939 --> 02:19.771
was tampered with,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.807
so even if P.T. didn't look
straight down the barrel,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.976
his tips were frosted
the moment he stepped onstage.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.878
All right,
I'll talk to the band.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.380
Tanner, canvass the audience
and production crew,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.682
and Scholls,
return my copy of "Total Recall"

02:30.684 --> 02:32.251
and stop texting me
after midnight.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.354
Let me get this straight. So
you're Skylar, the pretty one;

02:35.356 --> 02:36.855
Chad, the fat one...

02:36.857 --> 02:39.558
Funny. Funny one.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.759
Funny one.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.361
Denarius, the ethnic one.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.462
Man... life's so precious.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.797
You think you're gonna have
your head on your body

02:45.799 --> 02:49.268
your entire life,
and then... snap!

02:49.270 --> 02:49.968
Everything changes.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.971
How are things internally
within the band? Any friction?

02:52.973 --> 02:53.972
We get along great.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.576
I mean, we've been together so
long, we finish each other's...

03:00.614 --> 03:02.347
Did P.T. have
any personal problems?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.650
He was the bad boy.
Bad boys have problems.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.853
That's why he wrote the song
"Bad Boys Have..."

03:09.924 --> 03:12.324
After him and Lori Loughlin
broke up,

03:12.326 --> 03:14.960
he made a few
bad Beanie Baby investments

03:14.962 --> 03:16.762
and then hit hard times.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.596
I hear that.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.464
I got a garage full of pogs
I can't unload.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.666
But all we can do is keep going.

03:20.668 --> 03:22.534
I mean, what we gonna do?
Have a funeral?

03:22.536 --> 03:26.872
Mind if I look at this stuff?
Knock yourself out.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.006
Wow.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.775
Are all these from your fans?

03:29.777 --> 03:33.645
Boypocalypse Wow
has the best fans in the world.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.615
Who's Fran Tabuto? She's
our number-one fan.

03:36.617 --> 03:40.018
She's been to every concert,
all the mall openings,

03:40.020 --> 03:43.989
a few dentist appointments,
one shower.

03:43.991 --> 03:44.856
She's harmless.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.758
Seems like P.T.
was her favorite.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.760
"If I can't have you,
no one will.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.029
Marry me or die. XO, Fran."

03:51.031 --> 03:53.832
Do you guys mind if I have this?

03:53.834 --> 03:57.970
Sure. Thanks.

04:02.076 --> 04:06.411
Name, prisoner's name.
Reason for visit.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.053
Detective Tribeca, Diane Duran.

04:15.055 --> 04:18.390
"Seeking answers about the
location of a former boyfriend"

04:18.392 --> 04:20.791
I believed to be dead
but is actually alive

04:20.793 --> 04:22.661
and part of
an elaborate conspiracy

04:22.663 --> 04:25.731
"of which I've only
scratched the scarface."

04:25.733 --> 04:26.798
Surface.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.969
Stall 4.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.056
You dirty rat. I want my money.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.058
You're gonna give it to me.
It's <i> my</i> money.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.827
No, no.
I'm a detective with the LAPD.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.363
I'll take a look at it.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.037
Tribeca.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.005
I never thought
I'd see <i> you</i> again.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.640
Would you care
for a glass of pinot?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.642
It's from the vineyard
in my toilet.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.710
Sergeant Pepper.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.944
I know he's still alive.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.946
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.515
Yes, you do.

05:19.153 --> 05:22.854
Tell me where to find him. <i>You</i>
don't find <i> him. He</i> finds <i> you.</i>

05:22.856 --> 05:24.656
Damn it, Duran!
You give me his exact loc...

05:24.658 --> 05:27.025
Hold on a second.
I'm getting another call.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.895
Hello? Okay.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.331
All right, give me a minute.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.065
I have to take this,

05:33.067 --> 05:35.133
but if you're serious
about finding Pepper,

05:35.135 --> 05:36.034
he'll meet you here.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.403
But only go if you're serious

05:38.405 --> 05:41.740
about knowing
what the world really is.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.609
Thank you for holding.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.211
Okay, I'm taking off my top,

05:46.213 --> 05:47.946
and then I'm gonna go
to the grocery store

05:47.948 --> 05:49.981
and I'm gonna buy some Kombucha.

05:55.789 --> 05:59.858
Someone's home.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.052
Ms. Tabuto?

06:27.054 --> 06:29.621
LAPD! Open up!

06:30.491 --> 06:31.957
Let's rock and roll.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.092
1, 2, 3.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.562
Hello?

06:39.199 --> 06:40.165
Really?

06:40.167 --> 06:43.735
I step out one time
in eight hours.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.936
Eddie.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.171
I can't believe it.

06:46.173 --> 06:50.575
Angie...
we have a lot to talk about.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.145
But could you just
go outside again

06:53.147 --> 06:55.480
so I could be in the chair?

06:58.284 --> 07:00.018
You're under arrest for
probably murdering P.T. Cruiser.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.854
I didn't kill him. I <i> love</i> him.
Why would I kill him?

07:02.856 --> 07:04.456
Hey, we'll ask the questions
around here.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.857
Why would you kill him?

07:05.859 --> 07:08.460
I didn't. You think we
got the right person?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.262
This place looks pretty normal.

07:10.264 --> 07:11.997
Mind if we take a look around?

07:11.999 --> 07:14.933
Sure. As long as you don't
go into <i> that</i> room.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.103
I think
that's where we'll start.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.517
You have the right
to remain silent.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.086
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

07:35.088 --> 07:35.987
in the court of law.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.857
This offer cannot be combined
with any other rights.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.992
Void where prohibited by law.

07:40.994 --> 07:42.227
Some assembly required.

07:42.229 --> 07:45.897
Driver does not carry cash.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.304
I have so many questions.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.939
I thought you were dead.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.475
How could you do that to me?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.647
Does that answer your question?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.383
Yes... but then what about
the phone calls?

08:05.385 --> 08:08.487
If you were alive,
why not just...

08:10.123 --> 08:13.458
That makes sense.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.261
But then how did you...

08:17.498 --> 08:20.165
I guess that covers it.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.133
No more questions.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.440
You remember
how to do this, right?

08:28.442 --> 08:31.042
I think I can figure it out.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.054
No. No.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.558
All right,
maybe I-I need a refresher.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.131
You wanted to see me?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.534
I have no desire to see you,
but it's my job to report to you

08:55.536 --> 08:56.701
what I find about your cases.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.504
There's no way Fran Tabuto
murdered P.T. Cruiser.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.007
We were in the apartment. That
woman's guilty of <i> something.</i>

09:02.009 --> 09:04.709
Nothing we found in that apartment
incriminates her in this murder.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.579
You want us to set free
the lunatic that made <i> this?</i>

09:07.581 --> 09:08.713
Not all those teeth are his.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.282
Out of all of Fran's letters,
only the one

09:10.284 --> 09:12.551
you found in the dressing room
threatens violence,

09:12.553 --> 09:14.019
and it wasn't
in her handwriting.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.387
Are you saying
we got the wrong guy?

09:15.389 --> 09:16.454
I'm saying if I were you,

09:16.456 --> 09:19.224
I'd get back together with me
and reopen your investigation.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.664
Why are you talking to me?

09:25.666 --> 09:26.364
Really.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.999
I mean, didn't you already
arrest a murderer?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.135
Her handwriting didn't match
the threatening letter,

09:30.137 --> 09:31.903
so we're thinking
she was framed.

09:33.941 --> 09:34.973
So, who...

09:34.975 --> 09:37.208
Who are you looking at?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.643
I'm looking at you, Mr. Pfoopa.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.545
You've gotten a lot of press
since Cruiser's death.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.613
Ticket sales
are through the roof,

09:41.615 --> 09:43.648
and GQ just named you
Scumbag of the Year.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.619
Am I profiting
off P.T. Cruiser's death?

09:47.621 --> 09:48.253
Yes!

09:48.255 --> 09:50.989
Is Boypocalypse Wow
playing arenas now

09:50.991 --> 09:52.657
instead of rec centers? Yes!

09:52.659 --> 09:53.992
Did I place an order
this morning

09:53.994 --> 09:56.761
for 1 million detachable
bobbleheads in P.T.'s likeness?

09:56.763 --> 09:59.931
No, 'cause I just
thought of that.

09:59.933 --> 10:00.398
Look.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.267
If I had known that his death
would be this good for business,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.269
I would have killed
the son of a bitch years ago,

10:04.271 --> 10:05.704
but I didn't know.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.339
I didn't kill him.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.374
So cool your jets.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.179
See, the thing is,
once we get a new bad boy,

10:14.181 --> 10:15.280
no limit to Boypocalypse Wow.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.248
You want to investigate me,
go right ahead.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.216
I got nothing to hide.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.485
So you're saying
if the LAPD does some digging,

10:20.487 --> 10:22.721
we're not gonna find
any skeletons in your closet?

10:22.723 --> 10:26.257
I bought every one of
those skeletons online legally.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.359
Fran Tabuto was set up...

10:27.361 --> 10:29.728
Something three dating sites
weren't able to do.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.464
The murderer thought Fran
would be a perfect patsy.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.833
It <i> had</i> to be someone
with backstage access.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.134
The whole crew had alibis.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.437
I'm thinking somebody
in the band killed him.

10:39.439 --> 10:40.405
Since Pfoopa's cooperating,

10:40.407 --> 10:43.241
I say we place somebody
undercover with the band.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.010
I mean, they got to be
believable, though.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.646
They got to know the dance moves
and the songs cold.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.514
Now, who do we have
that can pass for a pop star?

10:49.516 --> 10:52.083
If for one second
they think that he's a cop

10:52.085 --> 10:53.985
and not a handsome
versatile musician,

10:53.987 --> 10:55.020
the whole operation's blown.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.756
Not to mention we'll have
a dead cop on our hands.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.357
Detective Green! Yes?

10:59.359 --> 11:02.193
Is that soy milk in my coffee?
Sorry.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.728
I can do it. You sure, Tanner?

11:03.730 --> 11:06.197
I mean, I did "The Wiz" for six
months down at the Pantages.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.634
Which you all would have known about
if you'd have came to one of my shows.

11:09.636 --> 11:14.205
That was a crazy time for me.
Your e-mail must be going to my spam.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.106
It'll never work!

11:15.108 --> 11:18.510
You can't just say
that you're in a boy band!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.378
I mean, most kids go to
eight years of boy-band school

11:20.380 --> 11:24.516
before they even <i> think</i> about
putting on a hat the wrong way.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.617
You got to earn it.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.185
We don't have another choice.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.220
This is the only way
to draw him out.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.221
Nobody will believe it!

11:30.223 --> 11:31.589
Look, can he sing?
Can he even dance?

11:31.591 --> 11:34.526
Sir, you'll be able to see
that I can do both.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.161
Okay. Let's see.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.296
Go ahead.

12:03.056 --> 12:03.688
Congratulations!

12:03.690 --> 12:07.559
This is the moment
when a man becomes a boy.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.237
I wish we could just
stay here forever,

12:19.239 --> 12:22.240
but eventually, we have to
go back to our real lives.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.542
I'm a cop,
and you're the people we catch.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.611
Well, we have this Airbnb
until noon tomorrow,

12:26.613 --> 12:30.682
so we have plenty of time to
talk about our future together.

12:33.653 --> 12:36.888
I'm gonna go pee
so I don't get a UTI.

12:59.746 --> 13:03.047
Whoa.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.316
Aww.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.453
Whoa.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.923
Aww.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.461
Whoa.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.464
Aww.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.605
Whoa.

13:27.607 --> 13:31.242
Aww!

13:34.848 --> 13:37.248
Pieced it all together?

13:37.250 --> 13:38.716
Almost.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.620
Now I'm done.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.423
Nice.

13:47.726 --> 13:48.693
When I was on the force,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.195
I found out
that the biggest criminal

13:50.197 --> 13:51.763
is not out on the streets.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.899
He's in the mayor's office.

13:54.901 --> 13:55.433
Mayor Perry?

13:55.435 --> 13:59.370
Off-duty, I tracked
crime after crime to him.

13:59.372 --> 14:03.408
Voter fraud, racketeering,
money laundering,

14:03.410 --> 14:06.411
racketeering fraud,
voter laundering.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.745
Th-The list goes on and on.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.080
I don't understand.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.448
Why didn't you just bring it
to the Lieutenant?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.851
You can't change things
from the inside.

14:12.853 --> 14:13.785
Trust me. I tried.

14:13.787 --> 14:16.721
What about Mayhem Global?

14:16.723 --> 14:17.722
I <i> am</i> Mayhem Global.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.692
As soon as we get
Mayor Perry out of there

14:20.694 --> 14:21.860
and elect Dick Dreyfuss,

14:21.862 --> 14:24.062
we can start to make
real change,

14:24.064 --> 14:25.029
crack down on crime...

14:25.031 --> 14:26.464
Well, actually,
Mayor Perry launched

14:26.466 --> 14:28.666
a really effective
crime initiative last year.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.402
All right, environmentally,
we can get the city off coal,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.872
get a train that goes
from downtown to the beach.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.040
Actually, Perry pledged
to get us off coal by 2020

14:36.042 --> 14:39.277
and he just expanded the
Expedition line to Santa Monica.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.145
Mayor Perry sucks!

14:41.181 --> 14:43.915
There's one number
programmed into this phone.

14:43.917 --> 14:48.119
When you're ready to be
part of the revolution, call it.

14:48.889 --> 14:54.325
Do you have, like,
a charger or something?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.030
Gentlemen, meet Daniel Tanner.

14:59.032 --> 15:02.333
Boypocalypse Wow
has a new bad boy.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.202
It's a pleasure meeting you all.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.270
I am such a fan.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.304
Hey, what's up, man?

15:06.306 --> 15:09.207
I'm the diversity
in this group. Step off.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.377
Denarius, he's the bad boy,
you're the ethnic one.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.145
There can be overlap. Yeah, man.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.214
It's 2016. Yeah, I
know what year it is.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.082
You're gonna get hazed
for a little while,

15:18.084 --> 15:21.019
but eventually,
you'll just be one of the guys.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.287
Thanks, man.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.956
Don't thank me, dickweed.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.190
Whoo!

15:26.192 --> 15:27.492
All right, guys. Here we go.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.128
Here we go.
Let's get it right this time.

15:30.130 --> 15:33.031
5, 6, 7, 8.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.200
Come on, rook! You got to be
better than this, dude!

15:36.202 --> 15:37.101
Keep up!

15:37.103 --> 15:41.139
Here we go. 5, 6, 7...

15:41.141 --> 15:43.107
Okay.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.208
You all went on 7 that time.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.278
You got to be ready to go
on anything, rookie.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.380
5...

15:55.155 --> 15:58.056
Yeah, welcome
to Boypocalypse Wow, son!

15:58.058 --> 16:01.125
Ooh! Welcome to Boypocalypse!

16:04.097 --> 16:06.164
And it took us
a little bit longer

16:06.166 --> 16:07.565
to cross the I's
and dot the T's,

16:07.567 --> 16:12.303
so please accept this
LAPD gift basket as an apology.

16:13.873 --> 16:15.406
So, who did it? Well,
it's still an open case,

16:15.408 --> 16:16.841
so we're not allowed
to discuss it.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.977
No idea? We have a man
undercover right now.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.211
He's posing as the new bad boy,

16:20.213 --> 16:23.147
so we should have the murderer
in a matter of minutes.

16:23.149 --> 16:23.848
Good.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.183
I just feel so bad for Skylar.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.251
All he's ever wanted
is to be the bad boy,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.320
and Pfoopa
won't even give him a shot.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.922
Skylar, the pretty boy? Yeah.

16:30.924 --> 16:33.091
He originally auditioned
to <i> be</i> the bad boy,

16:33.093 --> 16:34.525
but since he can't really
grow a mustache...

16:34.527 --> 16:36.561
Do you have a sample
of Skylar's handwriting?

16:36.563 --> 16:39.197
A note or an autograph?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.099
That's a perfect match.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.101
Over 16 points of similarity.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.135
The statistical probability

16:44.137 --> 16:47.138
of this being someone else's
handwriting is negligible.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.106
Thanks so much, ma'am.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.376
You can remove the pixelation
and put your shirt back on.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.176
Thanks, Monica.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.846
I know we ended on a sour note,
but we work well together.

16:54.848 --> 16:57.348
I just hope one day that
things can be good between us.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.451
It means so much
to hear you say that.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.387
Angie!

17:04.057 --> 17:05.256
You want to go catch a murderer?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.858
Rescue our buddy
at a big Hollywood party?

17:07.861 --> 17:10.294
Yeah, sure.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.135
If you start to cry...

17:17.137 --> 17:19.936
this is gonna get awkward.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.443
Tanner's still not picking up.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.412
Floor it.

17:31.051 --> 17:34.952
It's gonna be parties like this
for the rest of your life, man.

17:34.954 --> 17:35.920
Come on.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.623
Let me show you the house.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.465
"Tingly Feelings"
started it all.

17:47.467 --> 17:47.965
Wow.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.101
I remember that.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.537
That was P.T.'s biggest song.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.604
Yeah. It's yours now.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.941
You know, all I ever
wanted to be was the bad boy,

17:56.943 --> 17:58.843
but the moment
I walked into the audition,

17:58.845 --> 18:02.847
Jack Pfoopa said,
"We found our pretty boy!"

18:02.849 --> 18:03.414
Wow.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.684
Is this Jack's trophy
and antique weapons room?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.853
I'm more than just a pretty boy.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.956
Sure, I'm angular,
great smile, blue eyes,

18:11.958 --> 18:14.525
butt cheeks
like two vanilla cupcakes,

18:14.527 --> 18:15.526
but I can be bad.

18:15.528 --> 18:18.029
You know what I had
for breakfast? Cookies.

18:18.031 --> 18:19.964
I don't floss.
I don't make my bed.

18:19.966 --> 18:23.568
It's been over 48
hours since I talked to my mom,

18:23.570 --> 18:25.136
but Pfoopa's got me pigeonholed.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.371
I don't know, man.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.173
I mean, you're the pretty boy.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.442
Seems like a sweet gig to me.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.543
Exactly.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.980
That's all anyone ever
wants me to be... sweet.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.014
If I'm hearing you right,

18:37.016 --> 18:40.618
you'd do anything
to be the bad boy, wouldn't you?

18:40.620 --> 18:45.490
You got that right. Maybe
even kill P.T. Cruiser.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.557
Maybe.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.159
Skylar, do me a favor.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.628
Put your hands on your head.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.463
I'll do that, Danny...

18:52.465 --> 18:54.132
right after I do this.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.707
Tanner! Turns out
Skylar is the murderer!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.742
You found out already. Good.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.810
Skylar, drop the crossbow.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.779
Come on. You don't... You don't have
to do this. You're not the bad boy.

19:09.682 --> 19:13.985
He's right.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.720
I'm not.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.089
Skylar, don't!

19:18.091 --> 19:20.558
But if he's feeling it...

19:22.729 --> 19:24.862
Damn. That's a shame.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.832
Tanner, the honor's all yours.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.169
Congratulations.

19:31.171 --> 19:35.072
You're going to jail...

19:35.074 --> 19:38.142
bad boy.

19:40.446 --> 19:41.846
<i>The Boypocalypse Wow singer</i>

19:41.848 --> 19:44.782
<i>has been found not guilty
by reason of insanity.</i>

19:44.784 --> 19:45.850
I can't believe it.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.386
I can't believe he got off.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.020
Pleads insanity.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.123
Now all he has to do
is six months in a psych ward,

19:52.125 --> 19:55.526
a charity concert,
and he's back out on tour.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.528
Tanner...
can you get us tickets?

19:57.530 --> 19:58.529
Maybe the San Diego show.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.898
What's the point of any of this?
We have evidence, a confession,

20:00.900 --> 20:03.901
and the bad guy doesn't spend
one night in jail?

20:03.903 --> 20:05.636
That's the system, Tribeca.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.038
The system sucks.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.882
Maybe we don't take her
to San Diego.
