01:26.052 --> 01:28.720
Yo, are you up?
Yeah.

01:28.721 --> 01:31.122
Jax has got
the jump on you tomorrow.

01:31.123 --> 01:32.756
<i>Two bell.</i>

01:35.226 --> 01:37.995
I figure I owe you.

01:39.965 --> 01:44.002
Yo. Did you hear
what I said?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.069
<i>I heard.</i>

01:49.941 --> 01:51.609
Thanks.

02:12.163 --> 02:16.368
Everybody down now!
On the ground!

02:16.369 --> 02:18.636
You! Inmate! On the ground!

02:19.804 --> 02:21.372
Down!

02:22.173 --> 02:23.174
Get down!

02:23.175 --> 02:24.676
You heard him!

02:24.677 --> 02:26.176
On the fucking ground!

02:51.703 --> 02:53.771
You're up.

02:55.306 --> 02:57.074
To your left.

03:00.278 --> 03:01.812
On the line.

03:09.688 --> 03:11.122
All right...

03:11.123 --> 03:12.990
Step to the right.

03:24.969 --> 03:26.470
Let's go.

03:34.446 --> 03:35.779
Hands.

03:41.052 --> 03:42.986
Enjoy.

04:49.187 --> 04:50.487
Against the wall.

04:54.359 --> 04:55.392
Let's go.

05:31.963 --> 05:34.531
Lunchtime, inmate.
Eat your veggies.

05:43.007 --> 05:44.408
There you go.

05:46.578 --> 05:47.578
Hey, Roag!

05:48.580 --> 05:50.181
Yeah?

05:50.182 --> 05:51.282
Got the time?

05:51.283 --> 05:53.451
Fuck you care?
You got a date?

05:53.452 --> 05:55.053
No.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.354
Maybe you got
a sister or a cousin?

05:58.590 --> 06:01.125
Wanna get your head smashed?

06:01.126 --> 06:02.359
No, not really.

06:04.462 --> 06:06.230
It's five to 4:00.

06:07.532 --> 06:08.999
Wise ass.

06:14.372 --> 06:17.307
Hey, Fruitcake!
Let's go.

06:19.277 --> 06:23.113
Two... Three... Four...

06:24.482 --> 06:27.417
Five... Six... Seven...

06:28.419 --> 06:29.419
Eight...

06:30.588 --> 06:31.889
Nine...

06:32.891 --> 06:33.957
Ten...

06:40.098 --> 06:42.599
<i>290... 291...</i>

06:43.601 --> 06:46.336
<i>292... 293...</i>

06:47.939 --> 06:48.939
<i>294...</i>

06:49.941 --> 06:52.342
<i>295... 296...</i>

06:53.344 --> 06:56.481
297... 298...

06:56.482 --> 06:59.316
<i>299... 300.</i>

07:02.086 --> 07:03.587
What the fuck...

07:06.157 --> 07:07.525
Come on!

07:17.602 --> 07:19.103
You okay?

07:19.104 --> 07:20.384
I got everybody.
I got everybody.

07:24.109 --> 07:25.476
What the fuck's going on?

07:25.477 --> 07:27.111
<i>We've got a fire, gate two.</i>

07:27.112 --> 07:28.479
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

07:28.480 --> 07:29.713
Copy that.

07:34.218 --> 07:36.487
What the fuck...

07:36.488 --> 07:39.590
We got a runner!
Repeat, prisoner is running!

07:43.995 --> 07:45.463
Let's go, let's go!

08:03.715 --> 08:05.249
Nice look.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.584
Hush's idea.

08:06.585 --> 08:08.486
Nice, right?

08:08.487 --> 08:10.088
How was inside, boss man?

08:10.089 --> 08:13.725
Inside's great.
Everyone's asking about you.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.426
If you weren't out soon,
I'd be breaking into

08:15.427 --> 08:17.362
that motherfucker
and pulling your ass out.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.398
Only ex-con I know gets out,
wants to go back in.

08:20.399 --> 08:23.267
I didn't say "wants."
I said I would.

08:23.268 --> 08:26.069
There is a difference.

08:47.525 --> 08:49.806
Don't spend it all
in one place.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.708
<i>We have an escape
from Bendwater Penitentiary.</i>

09:20.259 --> 09:22.260
Step out of the booth
with your hands in the air!

09:22.261 --> 09:23.460
Showtime.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.766
Put your hands
in the air! Now!

09:28.767 --> 09:31.536
Get them up, now!
Hands in the air!

09:31.537 --> 09:35.605
Put your hands on your head!
Interlock your fingers! Do not move!

09:37.175 --> 09:38.642
Beautiful day.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.671
What the hell is going on here?

10:06.672 --> 10:09.841
Calm down, Warden.
I'm Lester Clark.

10:09.842 --> 10:13.845
I'm the CEO of B&C Security.

10:13.846 --> 10:18.416
You might have heard of us.
No?

10:18.417 --> 10:21.586
All right, well... We're an
independent security company

10:21.587 --> 10:26.224
hired by the Federal Bureau
of Prisons

10:26.225 --> 10:31.428
to test the integrity of their maximum
security facilities nationwide.

10:33.798 --> 10:37.868
This is Ray Breslin. He's my
partner and resident Houdini.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.506
Warden.

10:41.507 --> 10:44.642
For the last seven years,
Ray has been inserted into

10:44.643 --> 10:49.680
every maximum incarceration
facility in the system.

10:49.681 --> 10:52.350
He is there to ensure that
each and every one of them

10:52.351 --> 10:55.786
is 100% escape-proof.

10:55.787 --> 11:00.892
And apparently yours wasn't,
and he got out.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.793
Ta-da.

11:02.794 --> 11:04.261
Okay, fine.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.402
I suppose you're gonna
tell me how you did it?

11:11.403 --> 11:13.370
Think he wants to know?
Doesn't seem like it.

11:16.674 --> 11:19.243
Ray, you're on.

11:19.244 --> 11:21.412
Warden,
let's start from the top.

11:21.413 --> 11:24.515
<i>Any break requires three
things, knowing the layout,</i>

11:24.516 --> 11:28.586
<i>understanding the routine,
and help from outside or in.</i>

11:28.587 --> 11:30.788
<i>If you know the layout,
the weak side is obvious.</i>

11:30.789 --> 11:34.325
<i>In Bendwater's case,
it's the Secure Housing Unit.</i>

11:34.326 --> 11:38.296
<i>The government expenditure was 17
million dollars building that facility.</i>

11:38.297 --> 11:41.299
<i>It's state-of-the-art.</i>

11:41.300 --> 11:45.702
<i>The only problem is, it's located
next to an unsecured fire garage.</i>

11:49.440 --> 11:52.410
<i>First I needed to get inside,
so I made some enemies.</i>

11:55.780 --> 11:58.683
<i>Once inside, it was obvious
you were short-staffed.</i>

11:58.684 --> 12:01.285
<i>Federal guidelines recommend
two guards are present</i>

12:01.286 --> 12:04.755
<i>when transferring high risk inmates.
You only use one.</i>

12:04.756 --> 12:07.625
<i>Knowing the guards' routine
was the next step.</i>

12:07.626 --> 12:11.862
<i>Thirty seconds into my rec time,
my CO took a smoke break.</i>

12:11.863 --> 12:15.333
<i>For seven minutes every day,
there were no eyes on me.</i>

12:15.334 --> 12:16.499
Two...

12:17.502 --> 12:23.307
<i>After I knew the routine, all
I had to do was pick the day</i>

12:23.308 --> 12:26.644
<i>and arrange for a distraction at the
front gate for exactly 4:00 p.m.</i>

12:26.645 --> 12:29.714
But at this point, you were still
locked inside a steel box.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.750
To get out,
you had to have a key code.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.618
You have very
good chocolate milk.

12:37.855 --> 12:40.724
<i>See, the cartons contain a
thin layer of wax laminate.</i>

12:46.631 --> 12:48.599
<i>Lay it over the keypad,</i>

12:48.600 --> 12:51.160
<i>the impression will indicate
which four keys were pressed.</i>

13:03.642 --> 13:05.683
<i>With the four keys,
it's just a numbers game</i>

13:05.684 --> 13:08.052
<i>to identify
the correct sequence.</i>

13:08.053 --> 13:09.894
<i>I just needed
to get to the keypad.</i>

13:31.450 --> 13:33.811
<i>After I covered my tracks,
I had one minute to make it</i>

13:33.812 --> 13:36.680
<i>to the fire response
shed before the team did.</i>

13:46.832 --> 13:48.793
<i>I knew the guards
were still on the roof</i>

13:48.794 --> 13:51.829
<i>doing what they do,
which is wasting time.</i>

13:51.830 --> 13:54.230
What the fuck are you saying?

13:56.100 --> 13:58.420
<i>And before you know it,
I'm right where I want to be.</i>

14:08.746 --> 14:10.747
<i>Just in time to catch my ride.</i>

14:20.591 --> 14:23.094
Then your men drove me
right off the grounds.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.794
You have any questions?

14:25.796 --> 14:27.764
Yeah. One.

14:31.502 --> 14:35.639
What kind of man would choose to
spend most of his life in prison?

14:35.640 --> 14:39.777
Don't take it personally,
Warden.

14:39.778 --> 14:43.147
Over the years, Ray has broken
out of 14 of these institutions.

14:43.148 --> 14:46.884
Some people have a talent
to paint, some to sing.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.986
Me, I sing.

14:48.987 --> 14:52.490
Ray Breslin, he possesses
a unique set of skills.

14:52.491 --> 14:55.692
He is able to break out
of any prison designed by man.

14:57.449 --> 14:59.130
So have you been good?

14:59.131 --> 15:01.599
Yeah. You?
You a good boy inside?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.801
Of course.

15:03.802 --> 15:07.138
Okay... How did that
thing with that guy go?

15:07.139 --> 15:09.140
What guy?
What guy?

15:09.141 --> 15:10.674
When I was going in,
you were about to

15:10.675 --> 15:12.443
have dinner with
some guy, some bozo.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.044
Oh, yeah. That bozo
ended before dessert.

15:16.574 --> 15:17.815
Well, that's his loss.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.785
Yeah.
They're all losers.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.187
How many times
have I told you that?

15:23.188 --> 15:25.588
You want to get something
to eat when we get back?

15:27.691 --> 15:28.792
Is there a problem?

15:32.530 --> 15:35.132
You're a horrible cook.

15:35.133 --> 15:38.201
That's nice. Well, you can
complain in the morning.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.004
Ouch.

15:49.046 --> 15:51.287
Morning, sir.
How can I help you?

15:54.051 --> 15:56.854
Oh, Mr. Breslin,
I'm so sorry. I'm Jules.

15:56.855 --> 16:00.057
That's okay.
You're new here?

16:00.058 --> 16:01.826
No, sir. I've been
here five months.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.793
Five months?
Yes, sir.

16:06.964 --> 16:09.533
What do you got for me?

16:09.534 --> 16:10.867
Check it out.

16:13.237 --> 16:16.474
That's good. Very smart.

16:16.475 --> 16:20.711
Did you do this all by yourself?
I'm impressed. Genius.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.078
You're smart, but...

16:24.148 --> 16:27.016
Sorry, not smart enough.

16:28.552 --> 16:29.586
Don't be bitter.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.790
<i>Mr. Breslin, they're ready
for you in the conference room.</i>

16:55.579 --> 16:57.013
Morning, Les. Abby.

16:58.549 --> 17:01.218
Jessica Mayer.
It's an honor to meet you.

17:01.219 --> 17:03.587
Your work is the gold
standard in the field.

17:03.588 --> 17:05.667
What you've accomplished
is remarkable.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.896
Thank you.
And you're here because...

17:11.896 --> 17:13.731
She's Agency, Ray. As in...

17:13.732 --> 17:15.299
Central Intelligence Agency.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.800
You a spy?

17:16.800 --> 17:19.803
Worse. I'm a lawyer.

17:19.804 --> 17:25.876
Ray, hear her out. She's legit.
I called Langley myself.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.011
Fine. I'll just listen.
Go ahead.

17:29.747 --> 17:32.616
Mr. Breslin, after ending
"extraordinary rendition,"

17:32.617 --> 17:34.752
the Agency is looking for

17:34.753 --> 17:37.054
alternate situations for
incarcerating the sort of people

17:37.055 --> 17:40.291
who commit acts so despicable they're
best... Well, how can I put it?

17:40.292 --> 17:43.060
Eliminated?

17:43.061 --> 17:45.963
Disappeared. And we're
currently testing a prototype

17:45.964 --> 17:48.966
to deal with people no
government wants on their books.

17:48.967 --> 17:52.036
But first and foremost, the people
financing this need to know

17:52.037 --> 17:53.971
these facilities
are escape-proof

17:53.972 --> 17:56.574
before the whole system
goes online globally.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.942
What she's really
saying is that none of this

17:57.943 --> 18:00.144
is officially
sanctioned by anyone.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.312
Close.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.747
What I'm saying, Miss Ross,

18:03.748 --> 18:06.684
is that these facilities are
privately funded and administered.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.786
So the word "official"
does not really apply.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.588
So if anything goes wrong,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.156
nothing comes back to bite
you people in the ass.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.692
Whoa!
This is not your concern.

18:14.693 --> 18:17.828
Hey! I owe him.
I don't owe you.

18:17.829 --> 18:21.932
My job is to make sure the
United States is safe and clean.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.101
All right, can we just cut the
crap and call it like it is?

18:24.102 --> 18:26.036
These institutions
are off the grid.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.371
There are no trials,
there's no convictions.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.740
These people
are just disappeared.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.910
And you want him
to go in and test it?

18:32.911 --> 18:34.311
Maybe it's time
for me to interject

18:34.312 --> 18:36.780
into the conversation
that they have offered

18:36.781 --> 18:40.284
double your standard fee, that's
five mil, right? In advance.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.019
So you like this?

18:42.020 --> 18:45.189
Look, I'm a numbers guy.
You're the artist, Ray.

18:45.190 --> 18:48.124
From a financial standpoint, I like it.
Yes, I like it very much.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.096
Beyond the money,
Mr. Breslin,

18:52.097 --> 18:53.731
the people that are
sent to this place

18:53.732 --> 18:56.634
should not be allowed out
into the real world.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.837
Every one of them is a potential
game changer. For the worse.

18:59.838 --> 19:00.998
All right.

19:05.409 --> 19:08.178
Guidelines?

19:08.179 --> 19:11.649
The usual. Full work. Alias. Cover story.
Contact. Evac number. Right?

19:11.650 --> 19:15.085
Well, the only difference is to fully
test the security of the system

19:15.086 --> 19:16.720
it's essential that none of you

19:16.721 --> 19:18.241
know the location
of the incarceration.

19:19.257 --> 19:20.858
Will that present a problem?

19:20.859 --> 19:21.991
Yes. Yes, it would.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.804
When do we start?

19:33.805 --> 19:35.045
We just did.

19:38.142 --> 19:41.712
You and your new identity will
be picked up from this location

19:41.713 --> 19:44.213
by private contractors
24 hours from now.

20:04.101 --> 20:05.269
I don't like this.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.403
And you don't like her.

20:06.404 --> 20:09.373
Um, don't flatter yourself.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.942
We're going against
every protocol and guideline

20:11.943 --> 20:13.343
that you yourself
have insisted on

20:13.344 --> 20:15.345
every single time
that you've gone in.

20:15.346 --> 20:17.247
And I don't like her.

20:17.248 --> 20:19.016
You're right. There's nothing
to like about any of it.

20:19.017 --> 20:21.785
Then why do it? Because
he's ambitious and greedy.

20:21.786 --> 20:24.220
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

20:25.489 --> 20:26.989
Profile.

20:28.392 --> 20:31.295
Name, Anthony Portos.
Born Madrid.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.537
Mother died when you were 13.

20:33.779 --> 20:36.100
Raised by your
father in the U.S.

20:36.101 --> 20:39.002
You were suspected of manufacturing
bombs that have been used

20:39.003 --> 20:41.972
in a dozen political bombings
across Europe and South America

20:41.973 --> 20:43.507
for the last 10 years.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.409
Contact on site?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.411
Warden's name is Roger Marsh.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.479
Evacuation code?

20:48.480 --> 20:50.179
3-1-0-2-7-5.

20:55.279 --> 20:56.520
All right. Let's do it.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.888
Tag him.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.823
No. I don't need this.
Really.

20:59.824 --> 21:01.158
Yeah, you do.
It's non-negotiable.

21:01.159 --> 21:03.026
You think I'm
letting you go in cold?

21:03.027 --> 21:04.260
This gets old.

21:05.462 --> 21:07.297
Man the fuck up.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.032
Try it some time.

21:09.033 --> 21:11.401
Sounds good, boss man.
Any time you want to retire...

21:11.402 --> 21:13.937
I've been takin' notes.
I'm ready to step up.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.140
Where am I gonna find another
techno-thug as gifted as you?

21:16.141 --> 21:17.274
Freak of nature.

21:17.275 --> 21:18.274
Yeah, very rare.

21:22.813 --> 21:25.253
There you are, baby.
Transponder's good.

21:26.383 --> 21:29.119
It's like having me
right on your shoulder.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.486
Where else?

21:36.226 --> 21:38.928
Hey, don't forget
to write us. All right?

22:30.247 --> 22:31.280
Ah.

22:45.596 --> 22:47.630
Shit!

23:23.133 --> 23:24.902
Hold it!

23:42.119 --> 23:43.419
Put him to sleep.

26:37.227 --> 26:40.463
Prisoner 7458.
Anthony Portos.

26:43.233 --> 26:46.354
Welcome to the International
Detainee Unit intake.

26:47.304 --> 26:48.805
I'm Warden Hobbes.

26:48.806 --> 26:52.309
Hobbes.
Where's Warden Marsh?

26:52.310 --> 26:54.510
There is no Warden Marsh.

27:01.284 --> 27:02.724
What, am I disoriented?
Is that it?

27:04.121 --> 27:05.822
I guess that must be it.

27:05.823 --> 27:08.525
And I didn't see a man killed
on a transport helicopter

27:08.526 --> 27:10.526
and thrown out either, right?

27:16.233 --> 27:18.601
Mr. Portos,
your intake is finished.

27:19.603 --> 27:21.271
Wait!

27:21.272 --> 27:23.539
My evacuation
code is 3-1-0-2-7-5.

27:25.275 --> 27:26.476
Evacuation code?

27:26.477 --> 27:28.845
Yes. Evacuation code.

27:28.846 --> 27:32.848
Meaning you give me a number and you
walk out of here free as a bird?

27:35.218 --> 27:37.753
No. I don't think so.

27:41.224 --> 27:44.393
You're here now.
And you belong to me.

27:46.892 --> 27:50.333
Your intake is finished.

27:50.334 --> 27:53.270
Wait...
I have an evacuation code!

27:53.271 --> 27:54.871
Anything?

27:54.872 --> 27:57.407
Getting a ghost bounce, same as yesterday.
I can't find him.

27:57.408 --> 27:59.309
You ran a full diagnostic
on the system?

27:59.310 --> 28:00.777
Twice.

28:00.778 --> 28:02.345
Run it again.

28:06.416 --> 28:10.320
<i>All prisoners
A-Block proceed to Babylon.</i>

28:10.321 --> 28:12.955
<i>All prisoners A-Block
to proceed to Babylon.</i>

28:29.973 --> 28:31.273
Portos.

29:13.984 --> 29:16.719
Everybody's days are
numbered in Babylon!

29:22.525 --> 29:25.261
Babylon, death, death!

29:42.345 --> 29:43.480
Hey!

29:45.316 --> 29:47.517
Go make some friends.
You're gonna need them.

29:47.518 --> 29:48.817
<i>Assalam-alaikum.</i>

30:09.572 --> 30:10.773
Hey!

30:45.041 --> 30:47.976
Stay down! Stay down!

31:15.772 --> 31:18.040
New fish. We own you!

31:21.544 --> 31:22.878
Back off!

31:29.986 --> 31:31.086
Last time.

31:33.790 --> 31:34.790
Back away.

31:41.464 --> 31:43.799
Portos. Hmm.

31:45.101 --> 31:48.805
Rottmayer.
Emil Rottmayer.

31:48.806 --> 31:51.286
Really not much in a
hand-shaking mood right now.

31:53.443 --> 31:54.777
Okay.

31:56.079 --> 31:58.014
Your name.

31:58.015 --> 32:00.816
The fourth Musketeer.
It's a good name.

32:04.854 --> 32:06.655
Why are you in here?

32:08.491 --> 32:10.059
Why do you care?

32:10.060 --> 32:13.221
I used to work security for a
guy by the name of Manheim.

32:15.031 --> 32:18.701
Victor Manheim.
Have you heard of the name?

32:18.702 --> 32:21.537
Manheim, let me see... No.

32:22.672 --> 32:24.808
He's a genius.
Really?

32:24.809 --> 32:26.142
He has this habit
of taking money

32:26.143 --> 32:28.845
from the rich
and giving it to the poor.

32:28.846 --> 32:29.979
You've heard
that story before...

32:29.980 --> 32:31.460
I've heard that story.
Yeah.

32:33.183 --> 32:35.919
Now they're trying to find him.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.041
But I'm not gonna help them.

32:38.054 --> 32:39.655
Okay.
So fuck 'em!

32:40.623 --> 32:42.157
Right. Fuck 'em.

32:45.161 --> 32:48.631
Portos, don't get killed.

32:48.632 --> 32:50.033
If you say so.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.836
Last time they killed
a guy in here,

32:52.837 --> 32:55.958
they let his body rot
for three days. Hmm.

32:57.941 --> 33:00.876
Oh, and they canceled
the prison dance.

33:05.849 --> 33:07.983
Wouldn't want
to fuck up the prom.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.858
Morning, sir.

33:20.964 --> 33:23.165
That's another
beautiful piece, sir.

33:24.801 --> 33:26.903
You lied to me.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.204
I lied to you?
I'm not sure what...

33:28.205 --> 33:29.771
No, no.

33:31.841 --> 33:34.511
You say nothing.

33:34.512 --> 33:38.581
What am I supposed to tell the
client about the man you killed?

33:38.582 --> 33:43.052
That he just jumped,
like you said?

33:43.053 --> 33:46.622
This isn't a free-for-all. We're
paid to prevent him from jumping.

33:48.091 --> 33:50.726
And I can't get proof
of life from a dead man.

33:51.728 --> 33:54.531
So...

33:54.532 --> 33:58.101
You will be docked
the entire price of the asset.

33:58.102 --> 34:02.138
The entire price of the asset
equals a month of my pay.

34:02.139 --> 34:05.942
Then you're lucky the man you
killed was not high value.

34:05.943 --> 34:07.143
That is all, Drake.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.275
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

34:44.781 --> 34:46.215
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

34:46.216 --> 34:49.284
Hey, Portos! Look at this.

34:51.087 --> 34:56.190
There's no sunrise, no sunset, but
still they pray all the time.

34:57.193 --> 34:59.128
Don't you find
that interesting?

34:59.129 --> 35:01.164
Not really.

35:01.165 --> 35:04.901
You look like the kind of a guy
that finds things interesting.

35:04.902 --> 35:07.303
You've done time before?

35:07.304 --> 35:09.372
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

35:09.373 --> 35:10.940
Why all the questions?

35:10.941 --> 35:13.009
That's how I learn things.

35:13.010 --> 35:15.211
You really ought
to study somebody else.

35:16.079 --> 35:17.179
Portos!

35:18.648 --> 35:19.716
What?

35:19.717 --> 35:21.116
Need a favor?

35:23.686 --> 35:24.926
The favor man.

36:04.327 --> 36:06.863
For a man who is
not interested,

36:06.864 --> 36:08.263
you're doing a lot of looking.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.070
What do you need?

36:16.239 --> 36:18.774
I need to get into
the isolation area.

36:19.909 --> 36:22.311
No, you really don't.

36:22.312 --> 36:26.014
Yeah, I really do.
Call it a favor.

36:27.417 --> 36:28.457
Okay?

36:31.454 --> 36:33.256
Okay.

36:33.257 --> 36:34.723
Good. Ah!

36:41.297 --> 36:42.999
That's a favor?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.901
Sometimes favors hurt.

36:44.902 --> 36:46.436
Really?

36:46.437 --> 36:48.304
Come on.
Okay.

36:48.305 --> 36:50.006
Let's see what you can do.

36:50.007 --> 36:51.207
All right.

36:57.013 --> 36:58.848
You hit like a vegetarian.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.849
Do I? You can do
better than that.

37:03.853 --> 37:05.154
Come on.

37:05.155 --> 37:06.489
All right.
Let's see it.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.091
Try this.

37:11.394 --> 37:12.462
Hurt?

37:12.463 --> 37:14.030
That was good.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.998
Look what's coming!

37:22.872 --> 37:24.506
Relax. It's pretend.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.177
Guess boys will be boys.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.381
That's enough.

37:34.284 --> 37:37.954
Ah!
Ah!

37:37.955 --> 37:39.989
<i>Put them
in the box! Now!</i>

37:39.990 --> 37:41.223
You can thank me later.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.512
<i>They knew he was tagged.</i>

38:36.513 --> 38:38.414
Of course they knew. Who do
you think these guys are?

38:38.415 --> 38:40.183
What do you think,
they're a bunch of

38:40.184 --> 38:42.318
yahoos from one of
those BOP facilities?

38:42.319 --> 38:47.156
This is the shadow world. These
guys, they invented this shit.

38:47.157 --> 38:49.325
Why do you think
they pay us all that money?

38:49.326 --> 38:51.327
Remember what
the guidelines were.

38:51.328 --> 38:54.168
What the fuck are you talking about?
There are no guidelines.

38:54.597 --> 38:56.677
Now, you call that CIA bitch.
Hush...

39:00.536 --> 39:01.536
Motherfucker.

39:05.107 --> 39:07.227
All right.
I'll make the call.

39:09.245 --> 39:12.447
Abigail, you got to keep him
away from me, all right?

39:29.298 --> 39:30.999
Give me your arm.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.531
You'll live.

40:02.532 --> 40:05.534
How does a doctor work
in a place like this?

40:05.535 --> 40:07.336
Would you prefer
there wasn't a doctor here?

40:08.571 --> 40:09.811
Where is "here"?

40:13.209 --> 40:15.277
<i>Hey, Doc, let's wrap it up.</i>

40:34.196 --> 40:35.430
Doc...

40:36.999 --> 40:38.199
What did he ask you?

40:39.702 --> 40:41.203
He...

40:41.204 --> 40:43.973
Wanted to know
how his dehydration

40:43.974 --> 40:45.854
compared
to the other detainees.

40:47.176 --> 40:48.377
And what did you tell him?

40:48.378 --> 40:49.978
I don't care.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.682
That's what I told him.

40:59.088 --> 41:00.128
Get him out of there.

41:17.006 --> 41:20.247
Did you find what you were
looking for in the box?

41:25.548 --> 41:28.017
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

41:28.018 --> 41:30.151
<i>All prisoners
back to their cells.</i>

41:44.500 --> 41:47.235
Who were you before you
came in here, Portos?

41:49.338 --> 41:52.475
You're always watching the room,
always watching everything.

41:52.476 --> 41:53.676
Are you asking
what I used to do?

41:53.677 --> 41:55.745
Yeah.

41:55.746 --> 41:58.280
I'll tell you,
but I need a little favor.

41:58.281 --> 41:59.415
Fuck that.

41:59.416 --> 42:02.151
All right, don't do it.

42:02.152 --> 42:05.621
All right, I'm listening.
What's the favor this time?

42:05.622 --> 42:08.102
I need a piece of metal,
about three inches wide.

42:09.058 --> 42:11.594
Round, smooth.

42:11.595 --> 42:15.497
Oh, no problem. I'll hit the Home
Depot, and I'll be right back. Okay?

42:17.500 --> 42:19.035
If you get me
that piece of metal,

42:19.036 --> 42:21.636
I might be able
to get you out of here.

42:29.278 --> 42:31.446
Tell Hobbes I want to talk.

42:34.992 --> 42:37.553
<i>Interrogation,
ready for inmate.</i>

42:37.554 --> 42:39.789
<i>Interrogation,
ready for inmate.</i>

42:39.790 --> 42:42.157
You've been here six
months now, Mr. Rottmayer.

42:45.127 --> 42:46.628
So you know how this works.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.131
Ten seconds.

42:53.436 --> 42:56.372
Where is Victor Manheim?

42:56.373 --> 42:59.308
You know, to many
people, he is a hero.

42:59.309 --> 43:00.743
Nine seconds.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.311
Do you have a pencil
and a piece of paper?

43:02.312 --> 43:03.646
Eight seconds.

43:03.647 --> 43:04.887
I could draw you a map.

43:06.449 --> 43:07.583
Of what?

43:07.584 --> 43:09.417
Where you could find him.

43:20.064 --> 43:23.666
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be an artist.

43:23.667 --> 43:26.669
My God, you are pushing it.

43:26.670 --> 43:28.990
Problem was, I had no talent.

43:29.305 --> 43:30.840
Six seconds.

43:30.841 --> 43:33.409
I tried and I
tried and I tried...

43:33.410 --> 43:34.476
Five...

43:35.504 --> 43:36.745
Do you ever have dreams?

43:36.746 --> 43:38.380
Four...

43:38.381 --> 43:39.748
Or did you always want to be...

43:39.749 --> 43:40.883
...this?
Two...

43:40.884 --> 43:42.364
One...
Done.

43:46.155 --> 43:47.889
Look. There.

43:51.727 --> 43:52.887
I told you.

43:54.363 --> 43:55.563
No talent.

43:58.167 --> 44:03.272
The records indicate that you
are a highly intelligent man.

44:03.273 --> 44:05.508
As such, I would have expected
you to see the situation

44:05.509 --> 44:07.309
and understand it
for what it is.

44:07.310 --> 44:11.413
In here, you have no control
over any part of your life,

44:11.414 --> 44:13.582
except your breathing.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.484
And you just
lost that privilege.

44:15.485 --> 44:16.685
Get him down!

44:52.288 --> 44:53.388
Keep going.

44:59.195 --> 45:00.261
Enough.

45:43.405 --> 45:45.474
What happened?

45:45.475 --> 45:47.875
Nothing.
I'm still here.

45:51.614 --> 45:52.854
Now it's your turn.

45:56.385 --> 45:59.288
I break out of prisons
for a living.

45:59.289 --> 46:01.457
For the past eight years,

46:01.458 --> 46:04.893
I've been breaking out of facilities
for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

46:04.894 --> 46:09.565
I think Hobbes used my reports
to make this place unbreakable.

46:09.566 --> 46:13.535
Someone wanted this place
tested, but it was a set-up.

46:13.536 --> 46:17.373
They wanted to bury me. I don't
know who, but I'm gonna find out.

46:17.374 --> 46:19.674
I need you to set up
another diversion.

46:20.843 --> 46:22.411
What now?

46:22.412 --> 46:24.513
You've got to go
back in the box.

46:24.514 --> 46:25.914
No fucking way.

46:25.915 --> 46:28.016
Want to get outta here?

46:30.719 --> 46:32.720
Okay. I'll do it.

46:35.791 --> 46:39.294
But if I don't
get out, I kill you.

46:40.429 --> 46:42.298
Fair enough.

46:42.299 --> 46:44.566
A successful breakout
depends on three things,

46:44.567 --> 46:46.802
layout, routine, and help.

46:46.803 --> 46:47.970
But they've taken those away.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.806
For now.

46:50.807 --> 46:53.876
There's something under the box.
I think it's a conduit.

46:53.877 --> 46:56.577
If it is, how do you
know where it goes?

47:01.917 --> 47:03.885
I don't.
But I'm gonna find out.

47:05.421 --> 47:06.522
This is good.

47:06.523 --> 47:09.024
It's disgusting.

47:09.025 --> 47:12.795
<i>The mind of a man confined works
differently than someone on the outside.</i>

47:12.796 --> 47:16.832
<i>He sees things different.
The architecture is vertical.</i>

47:16.833 --> 47:19.835
<i>The cell blocks, Babylon,
the box, the mess...</i>

47:19.836 --> 47:22.670
<i>Everything's in large
vertical compartments.</i>

47:25.574 --> 47:27.710
<i>Best guess is they
built out underground</i>

47:27.711 --> 47:30.112
<i>in large natural
fissures and caves.</i>

47:30.113 --> 47:34.616
In a vertical structure, 70/30 says
whatever's under that box goes up.

47:34.617 --> 47:37.085
If I can get in there,
follow where it goes,

47:40.530 --> 47:42.891
Let's say you're right.
How do we cut metal?

47:42.892 --> 47:46.562
We don't cut.
We don't cut at all.

47:46.563 --> 47:49.865
This place is subterranean.
There's moisture in the air.

47:49.866 --> 47:52.134
<i>Whoever built this place should
have used aluminum rivets</i>

47:52.135 --> 47:54.536
<i>to hold those panels down,
but they used steel.</i>

47:54.537 --> 47:55.937
Steel rusts over time.

47:58.874 --> 48:01.710
We apply that. We'll concentrate
the heat to those rivets

48:01.711 --> 48:04.545
and they'll expand
and snap right the fuck off.

48:05.547 --> 48:07.049
Concentrated heat?

48:07.050 --> 48:09.885
Yeah, from the piece
of metal you gave me.

48:09.886 --> 48:13.389
<i>You expose a toothpaste-polished
piece of metal to sunlight...</i>

48:13.390 --> 48:15.157
Or the lamps in the box. Right.

48:15.158 --> 48:16.925
At a hundred degrees
centigrade,

48:16.926 --> 48:19.161
steel expands .03
cubic centimeters

48:19.162 --> 48:21.930
and those rivets are
gonna come right off.

48:21.931 --> 48:24.166
What?

48:24.167 --> 48:25.501
You don't look that smart.

48:25.502 --> 48:27.569
You don't either.

48:27.570 --> 48:30.005
So most prisons
are built around small towns.

48:30.006 --> 48:33.709
No matter how remote, they need
supplies and a work force.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.911
If I can get to the surface,

48:35.912 --> 48:37.980
I'll know what it's going to take to
get over the wall, get out of here.

48:37.981 --> 48:41.183
But first I'm gonna need
that diversion in the box.

48:41.184 --> 48:42.851
How much time do you need?

48:42.852 --> 48:44.452
Three to five minutes.

48:50.025 --> 48:51.526
No problem.

49:12.147 --> 49:13.548
Step back.

49:14.550 --> 49:15.783
I know you.

49:18.954 --> 49:21.235
You don't know shit,
you cunt-eater.

49:22.991 --> 49:24.493
Now step back.

49:24.494 --> 49:25.828
Oh, now I remember.

49:25.829 --> 49:27.696
What?

49:27.697 --> 49:30.498
Your mother, she was my
favorite whore in Marrakesh.

49:31.700 --> 49:33.702
Man, she could polish a helmet!

50:05.934 --> 50:06.968
Ah!

50:08.804 --> 50:09.904
No!

50:19.281 --> 50:20.548
Hey!

51:26.649 --> 51:27.915
Ah!

51:30.218 --> 51:33.021
<i>You're killing me!
You're killing me!</i>

51:33.022 --> 51:34.790
Bringing up box four, sir.

51:45.033 --> 51:46.834
Now, what is he up to?

51:54.043 --> 51:57.011
Hey! Shut the fuck up,
you German dog!

52:01.850 --> 52:04.353
<i>Master control, please advise.</i>

52:11.026 --> 52:13.194
Just hold him till I get there.

52:16.865 --> 52:18.700
I've got a camera
malfunction, box two.

52:18.701 --> 52:20.701
<i>Roger that.
Just reboot the system.</i>

52:27.242 --> 52:28.075
Shit!

52:38.087 --> 52:39.327
Shut the fuck up!

52:43.092 --> 52:45.027
Hey, Rottmayer, shut up!

52:45.028 --> 52:46.294
Restrain and drug him, sir?

52:46.295 --> 52:47.795
Not yet.

53:09.885 --> 53:11.318
Lights off, box four.

53:16.892 --> 53:17.958
Now open it.

53:25.167 --> 53:26.901
Rough day, Mr. Rottmayer?

55:35.130 --> 55:36.565
Let's get 'em.

55:36.566 --> 55:39.901
Here's what you should know.
I don't care.

55:39.902 --> 55:42.204
Sooner or later you will
tell me what I want to know.

55:42.205 --> 55:45.307
It is inevitable.
Like dying.

55:45.308 --> 55:49.411
But know this, there will come a
point where I don't give a shit

55:49.412 --> 55:54.516
about you or whatever the fuck you
think you're doing right now.

55:54.517 --> 55:56.350
So have a lovely day,
Mr. Rottmayer.

56:32.321 --> 56:34.222
<i>Emergency
personnel to level two.</i>

56:34.223 --> 56:36.090
Emergency personnel
to level two.

56:38.226 --> 56:40.128
Report?

56:40.129 --> 56:42.370
Valve breach on level two, sir.
Electrical malfunction.

56:50.372 --> 56:52.207
Sir?

56:52.208 --> 56:54.568
Get the assets out of there.

56:58.513 --> 57:00.381
Open up!

57:11.159 --> 57:13.320
Open the fucking door!
Open the door!

57:40.055 --> 57:41.222
Did you make it?
Yeah.

57:41.223 --> 57:42.556
Where are we?

57:43.725 --> 57:45.485
Where are we?
I don't know!

57:46.227 --> 57:47.329
Fuck.

57:47.330 --> 57:48.396
They froze the check.

57:48.397 --> 57:50.298
What are we talking about here?

57:50.299 --> 57:52.580
The payment for Ray's services.
They froze the check.

57:54.302 --> 57:56.705
It's not frozen,
it's on hold. All right?

57:56.706 --> 57:59.140
It's very common in
a $2.5 million transaction.

57:59.141 --> 58:01.676
No. Common would be a week,
maybe 10 days.

58:01.677 --> 58:03.211
This has been
way longer than that.

58:03.212 --> 58:05.713
Jesus, Abby.
It's the federal government.

58:08.049 --> 58:09.451
You know how they work.

58:09.452 --> 58:10.585
Did you call that woman?

58:10.586 --> 58:12.721
Yeah, I called.
Everything is fine.

58:12.722 --> 58:13.721
Then where is he?

58:15.564 --> 58:17.726
He is on the job
that he was hired to do.

58:17.727 --> 58:20.094
So you're saying it's all good?

58:23.198 --> 58:24.566
It's all good.

58:24.567 --> 58:26.768
Where was the breach?

58:26.769 --> 58:29.738
The auxiliary ballast tank
system on the starboard side.

58:29.739 --> 58:33.174
Compartments five and seven
have been compromised.

58:33.175 --> 58:36.176
And that leads to the ventilation
shaft under box two.

58:38.079 --> 58:39.279
Portos.

58:52.127 --> 58:53.728
Yeah, they're full of rust.

58:53.729 --> 58:55.689
Water pressure must have
snapped them clean off.

58:58.166 --> 58:59.466
Maybe.

59:06.068 --> 59:07.709
<i>Portos isn't his name, is it?</i>

59:07.710 --> 59:10.211
Why wasn't I alerted?

59:10.212 --> 59:11.780
<i>Look, it's like this. There's
a lot of people paying money</i>

59:11.781 --> 59:14.716
<i>to make sure that
facility is unbreakable.</i>

59:14.717 --> 59:18.086
It's Ray Breslin.
The great Ray Breslin.

59:18.087 --> 59:20.555
He's there to prove that
not even he can get out.

59:20.556 --> 59:24.359
You make sure he stays there forever.
Do you have a problem with that?

59:24.360 --> 59:28.163
No. Not at all.
Just the opposite.

59:28.164 --> 59:29.697
Fucker.

59:29.698 --> 59:32.233
<i>All right, good.
There's one more thing.</i>

59:32.234 --> 59:37.172
The Chinese banks have joined
the Brazilians, the Russians,

59:37.173 --> 59:40.308
the English, the U.S.
and the Swiss banks.

59:40.309 --> 59:44.546
They're all paying to find out the
whereabouts of this Manheim fellow.

59:44.547 --> 59:46.815
Word on the street is that
he has developed a program

59:46.816 --> 59:51.186
to turn the entire world banking
system into fucking confetti.

59:51.187 --> 59:53.588
<i>Rottmayer worked with that asshole.
He knows where he is.</i>

59:53.589 --> 59:56.624
<i>Your job is to get that
information out of him.</i>

59:56.625 --> 59:58.593
<i>Well, it just so
happens that since Breslin</i>

59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.395
has gotten closer to Rottmayer,

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:02.597
Rottmayer has
developed a new edge

01:00:02.598 --> 01:00:05.233
to his defiance that
wasn't there before.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:07.234
I think Breslin is to blame.

01:00:08.503 --> 01:00:09.838
Then break Breslin.

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.519
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:13.408 --> 01:00:16.211
I have an assignment
I know you'll enjoy.

01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:46.274
Get on your feet!

01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:55.215
Wakey, wakey...

01:01:03.691 --> 01:01:05.760
Talk to me.

01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:07.494
Come on. You must fight.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.865
Get up!

01:01:10.866 --> 01:01:12.400
Stay on your feet!

01:01:12.401 --> 01:01:13.768
If we're on a ship,
we would know.

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:15.303
No.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.405
Not if it was 1,000 feet long,

01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:19.607
200 feet high,
with stabilizers.

01:01:19.608 --> 01:01:22.477
We wouldn't know a damn thing.

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.845
Wakey, wakey!
Get him on his feet.

01:01:36.758 --> 01:01:38.526
You can do it. Keep going.

01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:40.461
Come on, go. Move it!

01:01:40.462 --> 01:01:41.596
We can't get out of here.

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.158
Yes, we can.
No!

01:01:45.901 --> 01:01:47.568
Get on your feet!

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:49.971
You've got to stay strong.

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:53.907
Back up! Back up!
It's you I want. Move it!

01:01:55.543 --> 01:01:56.810
Ah!

01:01:57.979 --> 01:01:59.546
Piece of shit...

01:02:16.397 --> 01:02:17.764
<i>Stop it now, Drake.</i>

01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:39.821
Don't give up.
Don't let them break you.

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.922
What made you want to spend
your life in prison?

01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:44.959
Hmm?

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:47.761
Tell me. What made you do it?

01:02:50.031 --> 01:02:51.531
Tell me!

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:02.609
I was a lawyer. Prosecutor.

01:03:04.279 --> 01:03:08.616
<i>A man I put away
made a promise to me.</i>

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:12.754
This man thought about that promise
every day for three years,

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:15.890
<i>planning his way out of prison,</i>

01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.525
planning on how
he was gonna keep his word.

01:03:20.395 --> 01:03:22.496
Taking a man's life is nothing.

01:03:23.831 --> 01:03:25.032
<i>Taking his heart...</i>

01:03:26.734 --> 01:03:28.468
That's everything, isn't it?

01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:34.908
Everything.

01:03:45.553 --> 01:03:48.755
You see, putting people
in prison wasn't good enough.

01:03:50.024 --> 01:03:53.428
And I had to... I wanted to

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.797
make sure they stayed in
there, didn't get out.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:58.799
I understand.
I have a daughter.

01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:03.671
Never forget them.
You have a choice.

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:05.640
<i>You can die in here,</i>

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:08.742
<i>or you can get out with me
and punish who put you here.</i>

01:04:10.111 --> 01:04:11.311
You hear me?

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:13.513
Yeah.

01:04:19.754 --> 01:04:21.656
Yeah.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.758
<i>Good news and bad news.</i>

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:27.462
I was thinking about that first
meeting, privatized incarceration.

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:30.832
Off the grid, international profile.
And I started digging.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:35.636
Code name, The Tomb. Completely
for profit, totally illegal.

01:04:35.637 --> 01:04:39.774
Run by ex-military assholes and
Blackwater rejects. You know, bad dudes.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.676
If Ray is anywhere, it's here.

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.644
Where is "here"?

01:04:43.645 --> 01:04:45.011
That's the bad news.

01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:48.749
I don't know.

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.124
No access to any layout.

01:04:59.093 --> 01:05:00.694
No blind times.

01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:06.901
We're in the middle
of the fucking ocean.

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:10.805
But I'll be damned
if I didn't find a routine.

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:14.041
<i>They scramble the guard
shifts so they're never the same.</i>

01:05:14.042 --> 01:05:18.179
<i>But they can't change the routine
of the guards themselves.</i>

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.582
We don't know when they start.
We don't know when they end.

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:25.019
But I do know where they're
gonna be based on habit.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.422
See that guy
coming down the stairs?

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.923
See how he walks
all pigeon-toed?

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:30.458
The Duck.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:31.993
Yeah. The Duck
always works with the guy

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:34.195
scratching the back
of his neck.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.462
Hives.

01:05:36.631 --> 01:05:38.599
Yeah, Hives.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.536
When Duck and Hives work together,
they always do a circle.

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:42.804
They may do it at
random times of day.

01:05:42.805 --> 01:05:44.839
It doesn't matter
when they do it,

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:48.608
it always ends up being 128
strides, then they split up. Watch.

01:05:49.544 --> 01:05:51.779
Now they each take a side.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.649
Duck walks 63 strides,
Hives 65.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:57.084
Then they meet up at the top.

01:05:57.085 --> 01:05:58.986
The guard down there
at the bottom,

01:05:58.987 --> 01:06:01.022
the heavy-set guy,
he doesn't move much.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:02.790
My guess is he's
been here a while

01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:04.525
and only does
what he has to do.

01:06:04.526 --> 01:06:05.766
Louisa.

01:06:06.994 --> 01:06:08.496
Louisa?

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:10.937
His fat ass reminds me
of my first girlfriend.

01:06:12.867 --> 01:06:14.902
Nice.

01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:17.205
That guard over there
could be a problem for us.

01:06:17.206 --> 01:06:18.573
He's always looking around.

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:19.674
The Chicken Man.

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:22.610
Chicken Man, right.

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.580
My guess, Chickie's new here.
Does everything by the book.

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.049
How do you know when the shift ends?
I don't.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:31.853
But around this time, your girlfriend
Louisa starts looking at her watch.

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.920
My guess, it's lunchtime.

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.559
Welcome back.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.659
Thanks.

01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:42.630
Now that we've got the routine,

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:45.872
we just gotta ask the good
doctor where the hell we are.

01:06:56.037 --> 01:06:58.679
<i>I'm not permitted to
give you anything for the pain,</i>

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.982
so don't request it.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:04.552
You're a doctor.
You took an oath.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.888
"According to my ability
and judgment,"

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.723
"I'll protect my patients
from harm and injustice."

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:20.786
What you're
doing here is wrong.

01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:26.841
What exactly is it
you want from me?

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:29.083
I want to know
where the hell I am.

01:07:43.257 --> 01:07:44.324
Guards!

01:07:49.144 --> 01:07:51.265
It's okay.
It's under control.

01:07:51.266 --> 01:07:52.632
Put him back here.

01:08:03.778 --> 01:08:04.945
Sorry.

01:08:19.727 --> 01:08:20.966
So...
No.

01:08:21.862 --> 01:08:23.197
Got to push him harder.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:25.032
Push him, we'll lose him.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:26.634
No other options?

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:27.968
Plan B.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.871
You always gotta have a Plan B.

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:39.712
Did you get it?

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:52.658
Now I need his glasses.

01:10:05.299 --> 01:10:08.168
Sir? You want
to take a look at this?

01:10:13.915 --> 01:10:15.076
What's this?

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.142
It's a sextant.

01:10:18.345 --> 01:10:20.214
Of course it is.

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:23.350
It works. You spot the North
Star with the horizon.

01:10:23.351 --> 01:10:25.318
But it will only give
us half of our location.

01:10:29.924 --> 01:10:31.124
Bring Breslin.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.862
I'll explain how
it works later,

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.497
but first we've got
to get it topside.

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.832
Watch out.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:39.132
Ah!

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:56.449
Welcome to your
new home, Mr. Breslin.

01:10:57.785 --> 01:10:59.025
Section E.

01:10:59.954 --> 01:11:01.756
Waiting for inmates.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.357
You know who I am?

01:11:03.358 --> 01:11:05.993
I do now.

01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:09.434
I've studied your work very closely.
It's quite brilliant.

01:11:09.912 --> 01:11:12.233
As a matter of fact,
it's what I used

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:15.269
as a reference guide
in designing this facility.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.071
If you know who I am,
let me go.

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:19.507
No, no, no, no,
Mr. Breslin.

01:11:19.508 --> 01:11:22.843
That's not how this works.
Not this time.

01:11:22.844 --> 01:11:26.547
You see, the people who paid for you
to be here want you here forever.

01:11:26.548 --> 01:11:29.249
And knowing that,
and knowing who you are,

01:11:30.384 --> 01:11:32.352
well, who you were...

01:11:34.135 --> 01:11:36.857
I can't have you communicating
with Rottmayer,

01:11:36.858 --> 01:11:39.160
or anybody else,
for that matter.

01:11:39.161 --> 01:11:42.463
This is the reality.
And there's no way out.

01:11:42.464 --> 01:11:44.298
This can go two ways.

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.534
You let me go and I'll
pretend this never happened.

01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:52.339
You don't, and I'll burn this fucking
place to the ground on my way out.

01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:55.309
Effective right now,
no mess, no rec time,

01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:57.544
and no showers.

01:11:59.013 --> 01:12:01.181
I can get you Victor Manheim.

01:12:03.017 --> 01:12:04.951
Rottmayer trusts me.

01:12:06.821 --> 01:12:07.861
So you say.

01:12:08.823 --> 01:12:10.591
Not good enough.

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.526
What have you got to lose?
Finding him has got to be worth

01:12:12.527 --> 01:12:15.196
a lot more than what you were
paid for me, right, Hobbes?

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:17.164
It's a nice idea, but

01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:21.202
as it stands right now,
I'm in line to get both.

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:25.472
You'll never break Rottmayer.
He'll die before he turns.

01:12:25.473 --> 01:12:28.374
I'm your only chance
to get what you want.

01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:38.285
I want Manheim and his whole network.
Names. Locations in real time.

01:12:38.286 --> 01:12:41.889
Get that. If it checks out,
I'll let you go. But know this.

01:12:41.890 --> 01:12:44.491
You tell me every word
that you and Rottmayer share,

01:12:44.492 --> 01:12:47.060
or I will personally pull
the fucking life out of you.

01:12:48.062 --> 01:12:49.462
Fair enough.

01:12:56.036 --> 01:12:57.638
So what happened?

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.272
I'm playing you.

01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:04.211
Last night Rottmayer told me
he started his network

01:13:04.212 --> 01:13:07.882
with five guys
from his hometown.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:10.117
He said he could trust
his life to these guys.

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:12.186
Give Javed the sextant.

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:15.089
Show him how to use it. Tell him
it's his ticket outta here.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.958
Javed.
He'd rather see us dead.

01:13:17.959 --> 01:13:20.227
He'll be the last one
they suspect.

01:13:20.228 --> 01:13:24.231
He bragged how his network caused the
bank collapse in Iceland six years ago.

01:13:24.232 --> 01:13:26.066
I don't give a shit
about six years ago.

01:13:26.067 --> 01:13:27.587
I want to know where he is now.

01:13:46.587 --> 01:13:48.288
You want to die?

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:51.191
You want to get out?

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.099
Today.

01:14:02.569 --> 01:14:04.204
They're plotting an escape.

01:14:04.205 --> 01:14:05.471
An escape?

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.943
Really? Who and when?

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:10.310
I don't know all the details.

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:13.447
Just some.

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:16.050
Well, tell me
the details you know.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:17.250
Hmm.

01:14:19.086 --> 01:14:20.954
You give me things first.

01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:29.463
Mr. Alfredo, Afridi, or whatever
the fuck your name is...

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:33.600
Your opium drug cartel friends have
paid a lot of money for you to be here.

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.340
Of course they did,
those fucks.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.240
So aside from your freedom,

01:14:43.177 --> 01:14:45.612
what else can I give you?

01:14:45.613 --> 01:14:48.415
I want the guards
to leave my people alone.

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:50.149
The Holy Koran...

01:14:51.585 --> 01:14:54.321
I want one in my cell.

01:14:54.322 --> 01:14:57.358
And I want to say
the name of Allah

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:00.326
and the prophet Mohammed
in the open air.

01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:04.397
I want to be seen by my God

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.301
when I say my evening prayers.

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:11.672
That's all?

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.206
That's all.

01:15:16.744 --> 01:15:19.312
I want to be seen
by my God, Mr. Hobbes!

01:17:18.165 --> 01:17:20.767
30 degrees, 22 minutes.

01:17:20.768 --> 01:17:22.301
We're in Horse Latitudes,
calm water.

01:17:23.303 --> 01:17:25.339
North or south?

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:28.142
Water goes counter-clockwise above
the equator, so we're north.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:30.477
How do we get the longitude?

01:17:30.478 --> 01:17:34.781
<i>They brought a new fish in yesterday.
He said it was November 20th.</i>

01:17:34.782 --> 01:17:39.353
<i>We've got warm rain,
warm air at sea in November.</i>

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:42.189
Now, you're building
a secret facility.

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:43.891
<i>You're putting it on the water.</i>

01:17:43.892 --> 01:17:45.859
<i>You're at 30 degrees
north latitude</i>

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:48.795
<i>because you want
to avoid rough water.</i>

01:17:48.796 --> 01:17:51.532
<i>So you're going to want to stay away
from the Caribbean and the Pacific,</i>

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.666
<i>say, east of the China Sea.</i>

01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:59.840
If I was a betting man, I'd say we
could be off the coast of Morocco.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.408
It's just a guess.

01:18:01.409 --> 01:18:03.243
International waters.
Calm sea.

01:18:03.244 --> 01:18:06.847
Close enough to land for supplies.
Educated guess.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:10.517
I know a guy in Casablanca.
He owes me big-time.

01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:11.817
Enough to come and get you?

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.356
He'd still owe me.

01:18:16.357 --> 01:18:19.493
There's only one way to get
a message out. One way.

01:18:21.795 --> 01:18:23.329
My God...

01:18:29.336 --> 01:18:31.904
What is this?
You swallowed clotting powder?

01:18:36.743 --> 01:18:39.846
Listen to me. I know you
think I'm playing you.

01:18:39.847 --> 01:18:42.316
In Hobbes' office is a book.

01:18:42.317 --> 01:18:46.220
<i>Compromising Correctional Institution
Security</i> by Ray Breslin.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.522
On page 88 is a
detailed description

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.723
of Cell Block C at
Lewisburg Federal Prison.

01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:54.228
Guards!

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.963
Check it out.
And remember your oath.

01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:04.771
I can't stall Hobbes anymore.
I've got to give him a location.

01:19:04.772 --> 01:19:06.673
But we still don't have a plan.

01:19:06.674 --> 01:19:08.808
It's in the doctor's hands.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.062
<i>Medical personnel,
Interrogation Three.</i>

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:04.298
<i>Medical personnel,
Interrogation Three.</i>

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:06.433
Guards!

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.368
Bring me prisoner Portos
from E Block.

01:20:11.838 --> 01:20:13.873
Hobbes' orders. Do it now.

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:23.549
<i>Breathe in.</i>

01:20:28.755 --> 01:20:29.855
Again.

01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:34.928
I saw the book.
How did you know?

01:20:34.929 --> 01:20:37.496
I'm Ray Breslin.
I wrote the book.

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:51.478
Doctors are men who prescribe
medicines of which they know little

01:20:51.479 --> 01:20:53.880
to cure diseases
of which they know less

01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:56.782
for men of whom
they know nothing at all.

01:21:01.788 --> 01:21:03.823
What do you want me to do?

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.602
The doctor is in.
Now Javed has to do his part.

01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:29.015
Manheim's main base of operations
is 20 miles outside of Ruse.

01:21:29.016 --> 01:21:31.784
That's on
the Bulgarian-Romanian border.

01:21:37.524 --> 01:21:38.758
See?

01:21:40.127 --> 01:21:42.428
Ratting out your
friends ain't so hard.

01:21:48.402 --> 01:21:50.470
We've got 24 hours
before Hobbes realizes

01:21:50.471 --> 01:21:52.939
the Bulgarian
location is bullshit.

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.774
Who do you know in C Block?

01:22:01.047 --> 01:22:03.617
They've given permission
for your midnight prayer,

01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:05.584
so what do you have for me?

01:22:15.195 --> 01:22:17.663
Lock in on Breslin.
Yes, sir.

01:22:21.134 --> 01:22:22.735
What are we up to?

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.207
Louder.

01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:31.445
Louder. Louder!

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:32.445
Got you.

01:22:37.484 --> 01:22:38.724
Decode it.

01:23:06.146 --> 01:23:07.146
Stop.

01:23:10.984 --> 01:23:12.017
Zoom in.

01:23:13.854 --> 01:23:15.554
It's Makmar Hassan.

01:23:20.093 --> 01:23:23.263
Breslin is gonna have Hassan start
the break from Cell Block C.

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.964
We have a time frame.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.934
And we have a location.

01:23:32.172 --> 01:23:35.175
Cell Block C.

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:38.845
Triple the guard force there. I want
to know everyone who's involved.

01:23:38.846 --> 01:23:40.213
You will, sir.

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:45.051
<i>Cell Block C,
prepare for inspection.</i>

01:23:45.052 --> 01:23:47.253
<i>Cell Block C,
prepare for inspection.</i>

01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:00.833
Louisa and Chicken Man. They sent
everyone else to Cell Block C.

01:24:04.018 --> 01:24:06.139
You better be fuckin' right.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.740
Don't worry.

01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:14.881
Hey! You fucking
white trash scumbag bitch!

01:24:14.882 --> 01:24:17.584
Where are you going, you fucking
towel-head al-Qaeda faggot?

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:20.620
Hey, your fuckin' sister gives...
Fuck you, you diaper-head...

01:24:20.621 --> 01:24:22.261
You fuckin' skinhead!
You motherfuckin'...

01:24:28.962 --> 01:24:31.282
The break was never
happening in Block C.

01:24:39.205 --> 01:24:42.207
All men from C to Babylon.
Right now.

01:25:02.295 --> 01:25:03.997
Come on!

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.197
Argh!

01:25:37.397 --> 01:25:38.964
Come on!

01:25:42.202 --> 01:25:44.282
Where the fuck is Breslin?

01:25:45.672 --> 01:25:47.139
Go, go, go! Let's move!

01:26:05.346 --> 01:26:07.227
We've got 11 minutes
to get topside.

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.868
Let's hope
the doc made contact.

01:26:14.668 --> 01:26:16.001
Go. Go.

01:26:25.945 --> 01:26:27.814
What are you doing?

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:30.984
All the cameras are connected.
We've gotta block 'em out.

01:26:30.985 --> 01:26:32.418
Sir!

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.393
Say "cheese."

01:26:51.337 --> 01:26:52.337
Come on.

01:27:02.215 --> 01:27:04.183
Okay. All right,
this is it. Let's go.

01:27:05.218 --> 01:27:07.454
Engage security protocol five.

01:27:07.455 --> 01:27:11.290
<i>Lockdown procedure engaged.
Lockdown procedure engaged.</i>

01:27:34.856 --> 01:27:37.217
It's a full lockdown.
We're all locked inside.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.417
Eight minutes.

01:27:39.486 --> 01:27:41.421
They're out of moves.

01:27:41.422 --> 01:27:45.791
Drake, take two units. Drag
the rats back to their cages.

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:05.410
Hold up.

01:28:28.968 --> 01:28:30.435
Javed!

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:37.509
Open gate three! Take 'em!

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.189
Go, go, go, go!
Don't fucking lose them!

01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:57.230
Breslin!

01:28:57.231 --> 01:29:00.232
Breslin! Open before I
break you, you motherfucker!

01:29:02.335 --> 01:29:05.505
You'll never get out
of here alive, you arsehole!

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.906
We're gonna kill you!

01:29:06.907 --> 01:29:08.240
We've gotta move!

01:29:18.518 --> 01:29:22.422
Smash that door down. I'll come
around from the other side.

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.390
Breslin, how the hell
do they know where we are?

01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:26.672
You turned off
the cameras, right?

01:29:35.134 --> 01:29:36.535
Motion detector.

01:29:37.537 --> 01:29:39.205
Sir!

01:29:39.206 --> 01:29:40.239
Out.

01:29:52.414 --> 01:29:55.255
<i>You can play your
games all day, Mr. Breslin,</i>

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:58.558
<i>but I'm still in control.</i>

01:29:58.559 --> 01:30:00.999
Whatever you do,
I have the power.

01:30:02.528 --> 01:30:04.129
I own your ass.

01:30:05.665 --> 01:30:08.434
You guys have gotta
get up that ladder.

01:30:08.435 --> 01:30:10.904
I've got to find the engine room
and shut the power grid down.

01:30:10.905 --> 01:30:12.639
Those magnetic locks
will stay open for about

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.041
five seconds before the
back-up generator kicks in.

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:18.562
You understand? That's all
the time you're gonna have.

01:30:21.514 --> 01:30:23.448
Take this. Take it.

01:30:25.451 --> 01:30:27.687
You're a good man.

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:28.954
Go do it.

01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:32.492
What about you?
I'll be right behind you.

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:34.160
What if you're not
on the deck at 5:00?

01:30:34.161 --> 01:30:37.396
Do what you've got to do.
There's always Plan B.

01:30:46.339 --> 01:30:48.174
Come on. Let's do it.

01:30:48.175 --> 01:30:50.343
We're dead men.
There's no way out.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:52.111
Come with me. I won't
make it up that ladder.

01:30:52.112 --> 01:30:53.646
I'll carry you up the ladder.
But I can hold them back.

01:30:53.647 --> 01:30:55.648
No. I can carry
you up the ladder.

01:30:55.649 --> 01:30:57.116
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

01:30:57.117 --> 01:30:58.350
Give me your gun.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.653
Just give me your gun.

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:16.101
Allah be with you.

01:31:17.103 --> 01:31:18.737
I'll see you up there.

01:31:19.739 --> 01:31:21.406
Now go.

01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:24.643
Take care.

01:31:49.268 --> 01:31:50.335
Fuck!

01:31:52.138 --> 01:31:53.506
Report?

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:55.074
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

01:31:55.075 --> 01:31:59.012
We're taking gunfire
on the lower deck!

01:31:59.013 --> 01:32:01.214
If he made it to the lower deck,
he's going to the engine room.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.249
<i>Meet me in the engine room.
I'm coming down.</i>

01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:04.550
Copy.

01:32:04.551 --> 01:32:05.585
Get that fucker out of there!

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:06.707
Yes, sir.

01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:15.694
Clear!

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:36.749
Yeah. Whatever.

01:34:05.671 --> 01:34:08.240
Having trouble breathing?

01:34:26.259 --> 01:34:28.540
I'm gonna fucking
kill ya, motherfucker!

01:34:34.867 --> 01:34:35.867
Back off!

01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:58.391
<i>Did you see him?
Yeah, he's here.</i>

01:34:58.392 --> 01:34:59.392
<i>We're on our way...
I'll take care of it.</i>

01:34:59.393 --> 01:35:00.792
<i>No, wait, wait!</i>

01:35:41.701 --> 01:35:43.401
He's still on port, sir.

01:35:48.241 --> 01:35:49.274
What the fuck?

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.014
Go! Get down!

01:36:06.993 --> 01:36:08.560
We have a situation up here!

01:36:10.296 --> 01:36:11.296
Fuck!

01:36:38.557 --> 01:36:39.791
Go low!

01:36:42.862 --> 01:36:44.297
Go, go!

01:36:44.298 --> 01:36:45.297
Go low!

01:36:48.908 --> 01:36:50.069
Plan B.

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:51.603
No one gets off this ship.

01:36:53.472 --> 01:36:54.472
Shoot to kill.

01:37:03.549 --> 01:37:04.716
Ah!

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.897
Go, go!

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.064
Ah!

01:37:25.071 --> 01:37:26.372
We have to go now!

01:37:26.373 --> 01:37:27.372
Not yet!

01:37:53.065 --> 01:37:56.369
Give yourself up,
Mr. Breslin.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.803
You can run around,
make some noise...

01:38:03.509 --> 01:38:05.411
Spill some blood.

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.945
You can't get out.

01:38:08.781 --> 01:38:10.983
Not really...

01:38:10.984 --> 01:38:14.386
I know about
your wife, your son.

01:38:15.521 --> 01:38:16.621
Aw.

01:38:18.758 --> 01:38:21.060
I know every detail.

01:38:21.061 --> 01:38:25.597
So thank you for pointing out all
the small flaws in my creation.

01:38:26.632 --> 01:38:28.767
I'll be sure to fortify them.

01:38:30.536 --> 01:38:32.036
But your time's up.

01:38:33.539 --> 01:38:35.141
You hear me?

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:36.574
Breslin?

01:38:39.545 --> 01:38:40.880
Your time is up.

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:50.822
No one in. No one out. Search
every inch of this fucking room.

01:38:51.857 --> 01:38:53.993
And power this thing back up!

01:38:53.994 --> 01:38:56.094
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

01:39:25.224 --> 01:39:26.744
Let's roll!
Go!

01:39:36.702 --> 01:39:37.869
Argh!

01:39:55.688 --> 01:39:56.788
Breslin!

01:40:12.972 --> 01:40:14.172
Go down!

01:40:20.112 --> 01:40:21.846
Come on, let's go!
Down, down!

01:40:40.799 --> 01:40:42.800
We're gonna have to back off!

01:40:51.277 --> 01:40:52.944
Rottmayer! Gun!

01:40:54.079 --> 01:40:55.799
Gun!
Give me your gun!

01:41:37.222 --> 01:41:38.890
Boom.
Hmm.

01:41:51.236 --> 01:41:54.706
Have a lovely day, asshole!

01:42:29.341 --> 01:42:30.676
Now what?

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:31.909
Relax.

01:43:10.897 --> 01:43:13.018
You met her before.

01:43:13.019 --> 01:43:15.788
Jessica Mayer.
It's an honor to meet you.

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:17.790
<i>Your work is the gold
standard in the field.</i>

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:20.259
She has been my eyes and
ears inside the Agency.

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:21.794
Hello, Dad.

01:43:21.795 --> 01:43:23.227
And she's also my daughter.

01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:26.265
Hello, darling.

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:27.867
Thank God you made it.

01:43:29.268 --> 01:43:30.768
I missed you.

01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:34.039
What happened?

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:35.440
Oh, nothing.
Don't worry about it.

01:43:37.876 --> 01:43:39.076
You're Manheim.

01:43:42.247 --> 01:43:44.116
Didn't see that coming.

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.184
You should've.

01:43:45.185 --> 01:43:46.284
Yeah.

01:43:50.422 --> 01:43:51.957
How'd you do it?

01:43:51.958 --> 01:43:53.959
We have code names.

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.121
Code name Rottmayer meant
maximum security incarceration.

01:44:00.265 --> 01:44:03.936
When my dad was picked up,
it activated the code.

01:44:03.937 --> 01:44:05.437
And that's when
you called Les Clark.

01:44:05.438 --> 01:44:09.274
I needed the best.
And after you agreed to do it,

01:44:09.275 --> 01:44:12.377
I used my contacts deep
inside the DHS to get you in.

01:44:12.378 --> 01:44:14.780
And the name you
gave me was the I.D. code.

01:44:14.781 --> 01:44:15.780
<i>Portos.</i>

01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:20.352
Rottmayer. Emil Rottmayer.

01:44:20.353 --> 01:44:22.634
And I became your best friend.

01:44:26.191 --> 01:44:30.763
You are not user-friendly.
I had to work very hard.

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:34.032
And that damn box.
That was hot.

01:44:34.033 --> 01:44:36.201
It did get warm, yeah.

01:44:36.202 --> 01:44:40.271
But it doesn't matter. What matters
is that I'm out and so are you.

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.142
We both served enough time.

01:44:45.844 --> 01:44:47.278
You want to try it again?

01:44:49.481 --> 01:44:51.561
You son-of-a-bitch...

01:44:56.321 --> 01:44:58.023
I hope I never see you again.

01:44:58.024 --> 01:44:59.257
That hurts.

01:45:06.799 --> 01:45:08.299
One more thing!

01:45:09.402 --> 01:45:11.403
How much did Les really know?

01:45:11.404 --> 01:45:14.072
Only what I told him, at first.
But the next thing I know,

01:45:14.073 --> 01:45:15.808
he's gone around me

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:17.442
and offered his services
to the backers of The Tomb.

01:45:17.443 --> 01:45:19.478
So he knew where
I was being sent?

01:45:19.479 --> 01:45:21.445
He arranged your transport.

01:45:23.048 --> 01:45:25.017
Need a ride?

01:45:25.018 --> 01:45:27.552
No, thanks.
I made my own arrangements.

01:45:42.601 --> 01:45:45.170
Wasn't tracking. We
knew something wasn't right.

01:45:45.171 --> 01:45:48.140
Red flags going up
all over the place.

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:51.543
Clark was too calm about it,
so we started digging.

01:45:51.544 --> 01:45:53.078
<i>We found out he'd been
offered the CEO job</i>

01:45:53.079 --> 01:45:54.980
<i>of running
the whole Tomb program</i>

01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:57.416
if the prototype you were
buried in proved inescapable.

01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:59.885
At a salary of $5 million a
year, plus stock options.

01:45:59.886 --> 01:46:01.954
Tell me you tracked him down.

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:04.755
<i>Just like you asked. The
plan's in motion as we speak.</i>

01:46:16.935 --> 01:46:18.375
It's sleepy-time,
motherfucker.

01:46:33.552 --> 01:46:34.886
Oh, fuck!

01:46:38.424 --> 01:46:40.291
No, no... Come on,
come on, come on...

01:46:43.528 --> 01:46:45.397
Fuck!

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:46.664
Ray!

01:46:47.666 --> 01:46:48.666
Fuck!

01:46:52.237 --> 01:46:55.106
Ray!

01:47:00.413 --> 01:47:02.214
It's Hush.
What did he say?

01:47:03.115 --> 01:47:04.355
It's all good.

01:47:05.284 --> 01:47:06.450
Good.

01:47:09.187 --> 01:47:11.189
What's that?
