00:03.604 --> 00:05.339
SMITH:
Why you? What did you say?

00:05.373 --> 00:06.640
RYAN:
I didn't say anything.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.176
Well, then why'd
you get fired?

00:08.209 --> 00:10.111
I didn't get fired,
I got laid off.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.779
Fired, laid off,
it's all the same.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.181
No, it's not, Dad.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.448
The company had cutbacks,

00:14.482 --> 00:15.616
and they had to trim
five people.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.118
I was one of them.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.352
It was nothing that I did wrong.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.753
Of course not.
Never is.

00:19.787 --> 00:20.621
They only trim
their best people.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.623
Don't you think
that I feel bad enough?!

00:22.656 --> 00:24.358
I don't know, Ryan, do you?

00:24.392 --> 00:25.159
Dad, look out!

00:25.193 --> 00:26.794
(tires screeching,
horns blaring)

00:29.630 --> 00:30.764
You all right?

00:30.798 --> 00:31.832
Damn maniacs.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.367
Drive like idiots.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.069
There was a stop sign.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.404
Behind a tree maybe.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.440
Where do you want to eat?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.175
I'm not hungry.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.811
Come on, tonight of all nights?

00:43.844 --> 00:45.413
Especially tonight.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.484
All I want for you
is to be happy.

00:50.518 --> 00:53.387
Just... get your act together.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.423
Nobody wants that more than me.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.160
Things just haven't
worked out yet.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.362
How you fixed for cash?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.264
I don't know.
I got rent covered.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.398
There's an ATM here.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.834
Dad, no.
I'll figure it out.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.706
SMITH:
Just take it.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.208
For me.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.711
Okay.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.413
Believe me,
I long for the day

01:19.447 --> 01:20.781
that I can stop
worrying about you.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.584
Yeah, well, I long for the day

01:23.617 --> 01:25.486
that you can finally
butt out of my life.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.404
Oh, my God. Dad!

01:43.437 --> 01:44.638
Oh! Ah.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.878
No, no. Dad. Dad.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.615
Oh, my God, Dad.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.917
Dad? Dad.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.352
Dad, no.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.388
(crying)

02:02.523 --> 02:04.525
*

02:36.657 --> 02:37.791
Hey, Ducky.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.393
Oh, yay, Jimmy,
you're still here.

02:39.427 --> 02:40.861
Yeah, just
finishing up. I...

02:40.894 --> 02:42.696
Oh, man, are those
Abby's Famous?

02:42.730 --> 02:43.764
Yup.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.399
The Bunsen burner was still hot,

02:45.433 --> 02:46.967
so I figured
I'd whip you up a batch.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.702
Oh, they got little
skulls on them.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.438
Little smiley-face skulls.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.372
You can take them home
for your girls.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.307
Oh, don't I wish.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.808
Yeah, Breena took Victoria
up to visit her aunt's house

02:54.842 --> 02:56.510
in Syracuse this week,

02:56.544 --> 02:57.911
so I am a
swinging bachelor.

02:57.945 --> 02:58.946
That explains it.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.481
Explains what?

03:00.514 --> 03:02.950
Your lack of
swinging lately.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.518
You've been pouting for days.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.853
Have I?
Yeah.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.688
Oh, so much for my poker face.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.690
I mean, it's understandable.
You miss them when they're gone.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.526
Yeah, especially
this time of year.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.694
Getting your
mid-winter blues?

03:13.727 --> 03:16.230
It's not blues,
it's just, it's blah.

03:16.264 --> 03:19.433
It's darker, it's colder,
minor annoyances seem bigger.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.535
I start questioning
everything

03:21.569 --> 03:24.638
from politics to "Why did I wear
these itchy socks today?"

03:24.672 --> 03:28.476
Forgive me, Mr. Palmer,
but I can't resist the urge

03:28.509 --> 03:32.413
to give you one of my all-time
favorite pieces of advice.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.352
"If you're going through hell,
keep going."

03:38.386 --> 03:41.422
I wonder if I could
fit that on a cookie.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.591
(ringtone playing)
JIMMY: That is a good one,

03:43.624 --> 03:45.426
but I'm not going
through hell, Abby,

03:45.459 --> 03:47.361
not by a long shot.
(Ducky talking quietly)

03:47.395 --> 03:49.563
You know, it's-it's more
just, uh, I don't know,

03:49.597 --> 03:50.931
heck.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.600
So, you're gonna be okay?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.502
Heck yeah.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.405
And now that I got your cookies,

03:57.438 --> 03:58.906
I will be even better.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.007
DUCKY:
And busier.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.475
That was Jethro.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.444
Yeah, he's requesting
our services

04:03.477 --> 04:05.245
a scant three blocks from here.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.949
JIMMY:
Thanks, Abby.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.984
(sirens wailing,
urgent chatter)

04:15.523 --> 04:17.458
(camera clicking)

04:17.491 --> 04:19.760
GIBBS:
What's his name?

04:19.793 --> 04:22.430
Navy Captain Paul Smith.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.932
He landed a long way
from his car.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.534
Left his key in the ignition.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.969
Quinn, check out those
surveillance cameras.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.506
I've often said this street
needs a speed bump.

04:32.540 --> 04:33.941
Or at least a speed limit.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.976
It's like the Indy 500
here during the day.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.478
Now, get the gurney, please,

04:37.511 --> 04:38.946
would you, Mr. Palmer?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.781
Boss, this is Renee Prewdome.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.650
She's our one
and only witness.

04:42.683 --> 04:43.884
RENEE:
It's these kids

04:43.917 --> 04:45.819
and their texting.

04:45.853 --> 04:46.987
And-and it's
not just kids.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.423
Grown-ups are looking
at their phones

04:49.457 --> 04:50.591
instead of the road.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.692
Is that what you saw, ma'am?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.961
Oh, no, we-we
didn't see anything.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.698
Bruce and I were checking
our balance over at the ATM

04:57.731 --> 05:01.869
when all of a sudden, the most
ungodly sound behind us.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.405
The car was gone
before we even turned.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.473
No one else here?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.575
No, the-the man's son.

05:07.608 --> 05:11.479
I tried to talk to him,
but he-he was crying so hard.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.614
And how did you know
that it was the man's son?

05:13.647 --> 05:18.519
Oh, the poor kid just kept
saying "Dad" over and over.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.520
Where's the son now?

05:19.553 --> 05:21.622
I lost track of him
when the cops got here,

05:21.655 --> 05:25.593
but he's in his
mid-20s maybe, and, uh,

05:25.626 --> 05:29.630
he had on a-a red, uh,
plaid jacket.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.631
Okay, ma'am.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.932
And let's-let's step back here.

05:31.965 --> 05:32.966
Okay.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.538
Gibbs, look.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.842
(people gasping, murmuring)

05:41.875 --> 05:43.644
GIBBS:
McGee, fire department.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.579
Ducky, get that body
off the street.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.548
Torres, you're with me.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.816
DUCKY:
Quickly, Mr. Palmer,

05:48.849 --> 05:51.118
let's get him into the van.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.523
Mr. Palmer? Jimmy?

05:55.556 --> 05:57.558
Oh, my God.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.542
(gasping)

06:14.575 --> 06:16.410
What the hell
are you doing?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.011
Don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.012
(grunting)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.714
Palmer!

06:20.748 --> 06:22.650
(sobbing):
Please let go.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.884
What are you doing?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.686
I'm not exactly sure.
No.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.657
Please let me go.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.724
(panting)

06:30.758 --> 06:32.660
(siren wailing)

06:45.773 --> 06:47.007
Let me go! I don't
want to hurt you!

06:47.040 --> 06:48.976
I would love
to help you not hurt me,

06:49.009 --> 06:51.512
so please don't jump, okay?
GIBBS: Palmer.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.379
What are you thinking?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.081
I wasn't thinking anything,
Agent Gibbs.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.584
I just reacted, and before
I knew it, I was out here.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.186
Okay, come on.
Change places with me.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.053
RYAN:
No!

07:00.087 --> 07:02.490
No, stay back!
I'll take him with me!

07:02.523 --> 07:04.424
No, please don't.
Please don't. Please don't.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.227
(crying):
My dad's dead

07:07.260 --> 07:09.530
and it's my fault.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.666
Come on.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.007
Let me trade
places with him.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.842
I'm not afraid of heights.
No, no, no.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.544
I can pull them both
in if I have to.
Yeah, yeah,
but Palmer's got it.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.612
He's got it.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.549
Palmer.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.617
Keep talking.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.184
Okay, hey, listen, listen.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.054
If you won't come inside,
let's just sit down

07:34.087 --> 07:35.122
and we'll talk
about this.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.524
No, I'm not sitting
or talking, man.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.525
I'm jumping.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.126
No hero's
gonna stop me.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.629
No, no, no, I'm no hero!
I'm no hero. My name is Jimmy.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.863
My name is Jimmy.
What's your name, huh?

07:42.896 --> 07:43.864
Tell me your name.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.133
(panting)

07:46.166 --> 07:48.669
It's Ryan.
Ryan.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.538
Ryan, okay, good, Ryan, Ryan.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.205
Listen, Ryan,
I-I never thought

07:52.239 --> 07:53.507
that I would be a hero.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.878
Especially after
I screwed up really bad

07:57.911 --> 07:58.879
a couple of years ago

07:58.912 --> 08:00.548
when I chickened out, but...

08:00.581 --> 08:03.984
then a very good friend of mine
set me straight.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.686
DUCKY:
Yeah, there was a time when

08:05.719 --> 08:08.656
I thought I would be
an archeologist.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.890
Yeah, what happened?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.992
Why did you decide
to go to medical school?

08:12.025 --> 08:13.293
Well, although archeology

08:13.326 --> 08:15.128
carried a certain
romantic appeal,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.531
I soon realized
it wasn't in my bones,

08:17.565 --> 08:19.533
so to speak.

08:19.567 --> 08:23.671
You have to decide what's
in your bones, Mr. Palmer.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.138
Not a spine.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.607
Nonsense.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.609
You just have
a-a well-developed sense

08:28.642 --> 08:30.043
of self-preservation.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.145
You're training to be
a medical examiner,

08:32.179 --> 08:34.081
not an NCIS field agent.

08:36.116 --> 08:41.755
I have no doubt that you have it
in you to die a hero's death,

08:41.789 --> 08:44.257
but, for the time being,
I'd appreciate it

08:44.291 --> 08:46.727
if you could stay alive
to help me examine the dead.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.729
JIMMY: And with that
very healthy sense

08:48.762 --> 08:50.063
of self-preservation,

08:50.097 --> 08:53.066
I ask you to please
stay alive,

08:53.100 --> 08:55.603
so that we can both die like
heroes a very long time from now

08:55.636 --> 08:56.970
when we're old and gray,
all right?

08:57.004 --> 08:58.739
My dad was 53.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.974
He was an actual war hero.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.843
Thanks to me, he
didn't die like one.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.812
Why? Why thanks to you? Why?

09:06.614 --> 09:08.315
Everything I touch...

09:09.850 --> 09:11.752
(crying):
I swear.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.353
Please, let me go.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.624
(siren wailing,
emergency horn honking)

09:16.657 --> 09:18.025
(crying):
Oh, no.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.096
(line ringing)

09:23.130 --> 09:24.965
GIBBS:
Hey, Quinn.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.166
Keep fire down below.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.735
We can't risk spooking this kid

09:27.768 --> 09:29.637
while Palmer's
hanging onto him.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.839
Okay, Gibbs. Yeah, you got it.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.341
Um, excuse me.
Uh, Lieutenant?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.343
I'm gonna have to ask you
not to go up there.

09:36.376 --> 09:37.711
Excuse me?

09:37.745 --> 09:39.880
Yeah, crazy, I know,
but Navy interests.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.348
But that's a city building.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.683
Yeah, I know that,
but that's

09:42.716 --> 09:44.151
one of our team
members up there,

09:44.184 --> 09:45.953
and if he dies,
you're gonna be dealing

09:45.986 --> 09:47.821
with the whole U.S. Navy.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.357
(helicopter passing overhead)

09:51.859 --> 09:53.727
Engine 52 to all units.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.763
Stand down for now.
Wait for my command.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.331
But if you have
one of those big bags,

09:58.365 --> 10:00.901
you know, just in case.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.870
All right, boys, let's get
the air cushion prepped.

10:02.903 --> 10:04.738
Check out these skid marks.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.074
McGEE:
I don't see any skid marks.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.076
Exactly.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.311
(grunting)
No, no, no, no, no, Ryan.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.313
You know, you know, it's funny,
it's funny, Ryan, Ryan.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.049
Not ha-ha funny,
when I think about my wife

10:16.083 --> 10:17.084
and my young daughter,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.019
who wouldn't think that
this is very funny at all,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.688
but if I had to do
this all over again...

10:20.721 --> 10:22.322
(laughs)

10:22.355 --> 10:24.257
...you would definitely
be out here on your own.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.726
No, I'd be dead by now.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.728
You're nuts.
You have a wife and kid?

10:27.761 --> 10:29.897
Yes, and I love them
very much, Ryan.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.699
Then let me go.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.433
You got too much
to live for, man.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.102
I don't.
No. I'm sure
that you do, too, man.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.904
No, not anymore.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.272
I'm tired of screwing up.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.373
What's wrong
with screwing up?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.042
It's fine. It's fine.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.177
I-It's evidence
that y-you're trying.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.780
I just got my dad killed.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.716
Ryan, what happened?
Why are you blaming yourself?

10:48.749 --> 10:50.951
If I hadn't been laid off,
I wouldn't have needed cash.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.420
My dad wouldn't
have stopped.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.889
He'd be alive right now
if not for me!

10:57.825 --> 11:00.360
BISHOP:
Gibbs.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.195
Take a look.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.697
No skid marks.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.865
McGEE:
Whoever hit Captain Smith

11:04.898 --> 11:06.299
never so much as tapped
their brakes

11:06.333 --> 11:07.868
before or after
the hit.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.469
Not even a swerving
tire pattern

11:09.502 --> 11:10.804
to suggest
he lost control.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.205
So either we're
dealing with

11:12.239 --> 11:13.440
the steadiest drunk driver
in history...

11:13.473 --> 11:14.808
Or it was no accident.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.377
Ryan, you get
a look at the car

11:17.410 --> 11:18.879
that hit your father?

11:18.912 --> 11:20.714
No, it was going
too fast.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.016
Any disagreements
your father had?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.718
Just with me.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.219
GIBBS:
Think. Any enemies?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.487
Did he have
any enemies?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.356
No way.

11:29.389 --> 11:30.724
Not the Captain.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.892
Everybody loved my dad.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.360
He was perfect.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.328
He was perfect.

11:35.362 --> 11:35.996
No, no.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.765
Hang on, Jimmy, I'm coming!

11:37.798 --> 11:39.332
Stop, or I'm taking him
with me, I swear!

11:39.366 --> 11:40.901
GIBBS:
Don't do it, Ryan.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.369
Then get away,
both of you.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.871
I don't trust
either of you.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.842
Palmer, don't you
let him jump.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.044
On it, Gibbs.
(grunts)

11:51.078 --> 11:53.046
And you do not
let him fall.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.882
Where you going?
Boss, we can set up

11:54.915 --> 11:56.416
a command post downstairs.
No, there's no time.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.118
The squad room's
three blocks away.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.753
The kid blames himself.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.321
Let's go find out
who killed his dad.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.502
TORRES (over phone):
Bishop, you there?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.437
Just getting back
now, Nick. Hold on.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.940
What do we know, Quinn?
Victim is Captain Paul Smith.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.042
53, widowed, one child.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.478
Gulf War hero, and stationed
here at the Navy Yard since May.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.514
Anything on the son?
I'm still digging.

12:27.547 --> 12:30.050
Uh, so far I've got
Ryan Smith, 27.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.485
Listed as employed by

12:32.519 --> 12:34.822
Kelb Technologies
in Annandale.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.824
BISHOP: Whoa, check out his
date of birth-- that's today.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.325
Guy lost his dad
on his birthday?

12:38.358 --> 12:39.827
Hey, Nick, do you know
if he's told Jimmy that?

12:39.860 --> 12:41.561
To be honest,
I can't really hear much.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.996
Pretty noisy up here.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.198
McGee, we need
to hear him.
On it.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.967
Poor Jimmy.
What can we do?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.802
What do you mean?
DUCKY:
To help Mr. Palmer.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.871
I need to get
back there.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.906
We all gonna fit on the ledge
and hold hands?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.842
You want to help Palmer?
Do your job.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.544
Right. Well, Captain Smith
is down on my table.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.079
Perhaps he can help.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.814
I can be your Jimmy, Ducky.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.082
QUINN:
Not while we still

13:02.115 --> 13:03.083
need Abby, Abby.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.118
I spoke to the ATM company.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.220
They're sending security footage
over to you any moment.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.321
Okay.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.589
Gibbs, we've got
Captain Smith's

13:09.622 --> 13:11.424
operation officer
waiting in the conference room.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.960
Quinn, come on. You're with me.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.396
I came as soon as I heard.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.898
I've been working
with Captain Smith

13:17.931 --> 13:19.432
on the Freehold
for the last three years.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.500
He was such a great man.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.601
You know anything about his son?

13:21.634 --> 13:22.569
Cap talked about him
quite a bit.

13:22.602 --> 13:24.237
I know that they maintained

13:24.271 --> 13:25.839
regular phone contact
when we were at sea.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.407
Is he okay?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.576
I heard it was
some sort of car accident.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.879
Uh, well,
we're still determining

13:31.912 --> 13:33.413
just how accidental.

13:33.446 --> 13:34.181
Seriously?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.950
The captain,
did he have any issues

13:36.984 --> 13:38.485
or conflicts with anyone?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.854
Never. No.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.522
Everybody loved...

13:42.555 --> 13:43.991
Everybody?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.127
I mean,

13:47.160 --> 13:50.030
there... there was an...

13:51.398 --> 13:54.501
No. No, I can't
imagine Morgan...

13:54.534 --> 13:55.869
Who's Morgan?

13:55.903 --> 13:59.873
Commander Morgan, our X.O.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.909
The captain gave him

14:01.942 --> 14:03.176
an unfavorable
FITREP last week,

14:03.210 --> 14:05.178
and Morgan took it hard.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.579
I know words were exchanged.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.081
What words?

14:08.115 --> 14:10.350
Strong words, apparently.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.552
Bad enough for the captain
to threaten Morgan

14:12.585 --> 14:13.553
with a court-martial.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.188
A court-martial?

14:15.222 --> 14:16.623
A threat.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.891
I hear they worked it out,

14:17.925 --> 14:20.593
but things have been icy
ever since.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.595
Morgan's career
took a major hit.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.131
We need Morgan's number
and address.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.465
Of course.

14:27.968 --> 14:31.038
(sirens wailing,
helicopter passing overhead)

14:31.071 --> 14:33.440
Well, on the bright side,
at least there's no pigeons.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.443
They must have, uh, flown south
for the winter, I guess.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.611
Actually, pigeons don't
fly south for the winter,

14:38.645 --> 14:42.082
Agent Torres, but I appreciate
your bright side.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.450
Hey, how long's
he gonna be there?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.485
My guess, as long as
we stay here.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.154
Unbelievable.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.522
I can't even kill myself
without messing it up.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.691
In your defense, I'm the one
that messed this one up,

14:51.724 --> 14:52.960
so don't go
blaming yourself.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.627
Yeah, but I do.

14:54.661 --> 14:57.030
This isn't the first time
I thought about doing this.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.666
Dad was the only thing
stopping me.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.336
You didn't want
to break his heart.

15:03.370 --> 15:07.374
(chuckles) That and
prove him right.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.509
I'd already disappointed
him enough.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.711
Your dad said
he was disappointed?

15:11.744 --> 15:13.713
He didn't have to.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.682
He, uh, he wanted me
in the military,

15:15.715 --> 15:18.685
and I chose college, then
he wanted me to study business,

15:18.718 --> 15:21.054
and I switched
to architecture.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.056
When I didn't get a job
in my chosen field,

15:23.090 --> 15:24.591
he thought maybe

15:24.624 --> 15:26.559
we'd wasted my tuition.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.228
Come on, hardly anybody
gets their dream job

15:28.261 --> 15:30.097
right out of school.
Did you?

15:32.232 --> 15:34.001
I'm actually one of

15:34.034 --> 15:35.502
the fortunate few.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.505
Very fortunate,
considering I nearly blew it

15:38.538 --> 15:40.207
on my third day on the job.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.975
JIMMY:
I am so sorry, Dr. Mallard.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.276
DR. MALLARD: Don't make me
have second thoughts,

15:43.310 --> 15:44.411
Mr. Palmer.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.545
Second thoughts, sir?

15:45.578 --> 15:46.713
About you coming to work

15:46.746 --> 15:48.648
full-time as my assistant.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.518
It will never happen again,
Doctor, I promise.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.320
It was an extremely
unusual situation.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.155
They always are.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.258
See, I was in the shower,
and, uh, the doorbell rang,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.726
but I didn't know it
at the time.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.629
I hope this won't
become a habit, Mr. Palmer.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.597
No. See, I always
answer my door.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.766
I was referring
to you being late.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.202
Does this mean I have a job?

16:09.236 --> 16:11.671
I'm glad it worked
out for you, I am.

16:11.704 --> 16:12.939
But I've been
bouncing around between

16:12.972 --> 16:16.743
entry-level jobs for years now,
only to get laid off yesterday.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.778
Yeah? From what job?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.647
Associate
Systems Engineer.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.750
It's a fancy way of saying
"apprentice architect."

16:23.783 --> 16:26.319
Yeah,
"Assistant Medical Examiner."

16:26.353 --> 16:27.787
It doesn't sound
very fancy either.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.189
Is that what you are?
(phone ringing)

16:29.222 --> 16:30.223
PALMER:
Yeah, but I love it.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.060
I do. Most days.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.294
Every job has
its ups and downs.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.396
RYAN: Yeah, I was
just starting to feel like

16:36.429 --> 16:38.031
I was up when
they canned me.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.767
Hey, at least
you were up, right?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.769
Something better will
come along, it always does.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.538
When one door closes,
another one opens.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.608
And, uh, it's always darkest
before the dawn.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.611
And-and they define success
by going from one failure

16:51.644 --> 16:53.713
to another failure...
Hey, what is this, man?

16:53.746 --> 16:55.282
Is this, uh,
self-help karaoke?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.383
Honestly, I got
a million of these.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.384
I could do this all night long.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.552
Oh, my God.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.221
Hey, are you guys
hungry?

17:01.254 --> 17:03.490
McGee wants to
send us up some food.

17:03.523 --> 17:04.757
I'm thinking burgers.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.461
Yes, yes, absolutely.
Burgers.

17:08.495 --> 17:12.099
About to die anyway, right?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.400
Might as well have a last meal.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.801
ABBY:
Hang on, Jimmy. Hang on, Jimmy.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.503
Hang on, Jimmy.
Got the video?

17:18.138 --> 17:18.805
Ugh, you'd think

17:18.838 --> 17:20.640
ATMs would
have better cameras.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.110
Catch our hit and run?
Barely.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.277
Okay, so that's
Captain Smith back there

17:24.311 --> 17:25.812
getting out of his car.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.115
And then he starts
to cross, and wham.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.482
Just disappears into a blur.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.583
Slow down the blur.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.152
ABBY:
It's just a dark SUV.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.454
There's no plate,
no visible driver.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.388
Not even sure
of the color.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.591
Consider it black,
charcoal, ebony, noir.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.460
Whatever they call
the paint.

17:40.493 --> 17:41.794
Some of it scraped
itself off

17:41.828 --> 17:44.097
on Captain Smith's
watch on impact.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.265
Anything else, Duck?

17:45.298 --> 17:46.533
No, no surprises.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.735
The captain suffered
a crushed parietal bone,

17:48.768 --> 17:50.337
which killed him instantly.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.106
Poor fellow literally
never saw what hit him.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.342
Oh, and there's this.

17:55.375 --> 17:58.278
The son will want
his father's wallet

17:58.311 --> 18:02.549
once Mr. Palmer has
successfully talked him down.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.217
There's enough paint
on this watch

18:04.251 --> 18:05.718
to match it
to a specific vehicle.

18:05.752 --> 18:06.753
Palmer can't wait.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.854
Match it fast!

18:09.456 --> 18:11.724
Hang on, Jimmy. Hang on, Jimmy.
Hang on, Jimmy.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.194
So this building, what type
of architecture is it?

18:14.227 --> 18:17.797
It's kind of,
uh, Beaux-Arts.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.400
Elaborate, ornamental.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.535
Most newer buildings
don't even have ledges.

18:22.569 --> 18:23.903
Yeah, I'm glad this one does.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.305
I swear, I actually
thought I'd be

18:25.338 --> 18:28.175
in Architectural
Digest by now.

18:28.208 --> 18:31.311
Yeah, I hear you.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.613
In my 20s,
conquering the world was

18:33.646 --> 18:35.148
always just out of reach.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.716
Couldn't wait to make it.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.751
Meanwhile, everyone
on social media

18:38.785 --> 18:39.852
is just kicking butt.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.923
Promotions, weddings,
vacations.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.892
Yeah, well,
there's no B-sides.

18:45.925 --> 18:46.726
What?

18:48.661 --> 18:51.664
Everyone only posts
their greatest hits.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.200
No B-sides.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.835
No one talks about
their lousy days.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.405
Like when my daughter
is pitching a fit,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.207
and my wife is trying
to reason with her

19:00.240 --> 19:01.674
like she's a 32-year-old
instead of a two-year-old,

19:01.708 --> 19:05.178
and I am just
the world's worst referee,

19:05.212 --> 19:06.579
and...

19:06.613 --> 19:09.382
Point is, you can't
compare yourself.

19:12.219 --> 19:13.686
RYAN:
Oh.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.255
You want to sit down?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.923
I do.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.691
Okay.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.901
Ah.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.837
That's so much better,
right?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.272
Plus, I wore

19:32.305 --> 19:33.806
these really itchy socks today.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.278
Guys, food's here.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.648
Hey, no jumping.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.617
How they doing?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.219
I'm not really sure,
to be honest.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.187
We need to make
this quick.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.757
Social media's great
for keeping in touch,

19:50.790 --> 19:55.862
but there's no substitute
for in-person, human contact.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.897
Like, at work, when
I'm having a lousy day,

19:57.930 --> 20:00.900
my friends, they know
just how to lift me back up.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.935
ABBY:
Okay, Jimmy, that does it.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.604
Abby, listen...
No, you listen.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.906
You know what's infectious
during the holidays?

20:06.939 --> 20:08.741
Optimism is infectious.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.243
Optimism and

20:10.277 --> 20:11.311
joy.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.613
And joy and...
Kindness.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.647
Kindness.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.583
Courtesy.
And charity.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.784
Generosity.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.386
And gratitude.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.753
Selflessness.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.389
And faith,

20:22.422 --> 20:24.291
Jimmy. Faith.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.892
Faith is infectious.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.595
Life isn't perfect,
but sometimes things will

20:28.628 --> 20:30.497
work out for the best
if you just have faith.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.666
That's a very good friend.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.304
Yeah, yeah, she really is.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.938
I don't have friends like that.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.343
I'm sorry.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.516
(Jimmy gasping)

20:49.549 --> 20:50.550
Ryan!

20:54.921 --> 20:55.922
Hang on!

20:59.326 --> 21:00.627
I got you!

21:04.964 --> 21:06.433
(both panting)

21:08.568 --> 21:10.303
Hey! Hey!

21:10.337 --> 21:12.405
You don't want to die.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.073
What? Yes, I do.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.041
No, you don't.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.042
What are you
talking about?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.377
You saved me.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.011
I don't want you
on my conscience.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.547
What conscience?
If you went over with me,

21:20.580 --> 21:23.516
you'd be dead, too.
That makes no sense.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.617
TORRES:
All right.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.753
Dinner's served.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.064
You wouldn't have saved me
if you didn't want

21:38.097 --> 21:39.599
to live yourself.
You don't know me.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.402
TORRES:
All right, you two daredevils.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.036
Two double cheeseburgers,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.972
coming right up,
special delivery.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.375
What are you doing? No!

21:48.408 --> 21:49.942
Well, do you want to eat or not?
Not like that.

21:49.976 --> 21:50.977
Stay back.

21:51.010 --> 21:51.978
All right, all right.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.980
Okay, I guess,
Jimmy, uh...

21:54.013 --> 21:56.015
meet me halfway.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.351
I can't, Agent Torres.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.487
I can't risk letting him go.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.555
Okay.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.830
How am I supposed
to stick this to Palmer

22:10.863 --> 22:12.399
if I can't even get close?

22:12.432 --> 22:14.901
Okay, in the Boy Scouts,
they have a saying: be prepared.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.603
I am prepared with a plan B.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.443
Huh?

22:23.476 --> 22:25.011
We're gonna tidy up?

22:25.044 --> 22:26.546
No.

22:26.579 --> 22:30.016
We are going to attach
this mini-mic

22:30.049 --> 22:34.521
to the outside of the burger
box, and push that to Jimmy.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.022
Oh, what happens
when they grab the burgers

22:36.055 --> 22:37.457
and they chuck the box?

22:37.490 --> 22:40.427
Jimmy never litters.
(chuckles)

22:40.460 --> 22:42.929
Just admit it.
You saved us.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.531
I saved you.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.999
All right, let's try this again.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.643
Okay, I got it. Got it.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.077
Aw.
(chuckles)

22:58.110 --> 23:00.680
Those near-death experiences,

23:00.713 --> 23:02.549
they really make
you hungry, huh?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.983
(whispers):
Nick.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.452
Nick, we need a sound check.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.654
Um...

23:07.687 --> 23:10.790
Hey, uh, Ryan, by the way,
happy birthday.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.092
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.861
Yeah.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.563
Don't remind me.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.499
JIMMY (over speaker):
I am so sorry. I-I...

23:19.532 --> 23:20.567
How's that sound to you, boss?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.001
JIMMY:
This... this is just...

23:22.034 --> 23:23.903
Yeah, good enough, McGee.
Come on back.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.104
Tell Torres we're listening.

23:25.137 --> 23:27.139
The X.O. is M.I.A., Gibbs.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.908
JIMMY:
...not my intention to...
(phone beeps)

23:28.941 --> 23:31.143
Commander Morgan.
BISHOP: No sign of him at home.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.044
We're getting nowhere
pinging his phone.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.513
It might just be turned off.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.648
The neighbors say
he has a black SUV.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.584
Get his plate. Update the BOLO.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.986
JIMMY: You know, I-I normally
eat much healthier than this.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.088
Under these circumstances...
(chuckles)

23:42.121 --> 23:43.956
...nothing beats a good burger.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.092
Yeah. Just like
mother used to make.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.563
So, uh...
where is your mom?

23:50.597 --> 23:51.764
You haven't
mentioned her.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.233
She died. It was, uh, cancer
when I was 12.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.203
Oh. I'm so sorry.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.507
She was diagnosed in June,
dead by July.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.974
And Dad was never the same.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.976
Yeah? What about you?

24:04.010 --> 24:06.112
I was mad, mostly.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.681
My dad, he, um...

24:08.715 --> 24:10.617
he tried to be all
things. He was, uh...

24:10.650 --> 24:13.252
Mr. Discipline one
minute, and, uh...

24:13.285 --> 24:15.254
the next, he'd...
(sniffles)

24:15.287 --> 24:17.824
feel bad and baby me,
like she used to.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.858
Baby you?

24:18.891 --> 24:20.059
Yeah, he'd bail me out.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.161
He'd shake his head,
all pissed off,

24:22.194 --> 24:25.097
and then bend over backwards
to fix whatever jam I was in.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.667
You know, m-my dad was never
anything like that,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.836
Ryan, but-but I work
with someone who's close.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.171
Remember Agent Gibbs? Remember
him? He was here earlier.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.874
Tell you what, he might be
the toughest guy I've ever met.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.143
Now I know it seems, like, uh,
some people have it much easier

24:37.176 --> 24:39.946
while others have it
much rougher, but, uh...

24:39.979 --> 24:41.948
I think it's safe to say
that there's no one

24:41.981 --> 24:43.616
who's has had a tougher life
than Agent Gibbs.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.751
How does it sound?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.218
Reception still good?
Shh!

24:46.252 --> 24:48.054
JIMMY:
Believe it or not,

24:48.087 --> 24:49.756
his wife and his young daughter

24:49.789 --> 24:52.224
were both killed
on the same day.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.127
But you never
hear him mention it.

24:55.161 --> 24:58.164
No, he just...
buries himself in his work.

24:58.197 --> 25:02.735
And he builds boats
in his basement.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.037
He'll kiss Abby on the forehead
once in a while,

25:05.071 --> 25:07.540
but h-he's not exactly
a hugger, you know.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.108
(chuckles)
At least he's never hugged me.

25:11.077 --> 25:13.913
We all rely on him so much.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.982
That man has the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.617
You'd never know it.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.120
I really worry about him.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.256
But a-as tough as Gibbs is,

25:24.290 --> 25:26.125
on my darkest day,

25:26.158 --> 25:28.294
when our adoption fell through,
I mean, Ryan...

25:29.862 --> 25:30.830
...I lost my kid.

25:32.932 --> 25:36.669
Gibbs was the one
who comforted me most.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.638
JIMMY:
Take it you heard.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.940
Mm-hmm.
(elevator bell dings)

25:40.973 --> 25:46.045
Yeah, she, uh, she saw
the baby and just...

25:46.078 --> 25:49.315
I guess she felt the same way
we felt when we first saw him.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.285
Can't fault her for that, right?

25:54.153 --> 25:55.722
You should go home.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.224
I will. Yeah, Breena and I,
we just wanted

25:58.257 --> 26:00.760
to get all this stuff
out of the house, you know.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.929
We wanted to give it back
as soon as possible.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.063
We?

26:04.096 --> 26:05.564
Me.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.168
She's hurting, too, but, uh...

26:09.201 --> 26:11.203
she is so much stronger.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.605
(clears throat)

26:12.639 --> 26:14.140
She's ready to try again.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.208
And, uh, and me...

26:19.078 --> 26:20.980
...I feel like I can't breathe.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.718
I've never felt this bad
in my life, Gibbs.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.020
Ah, just wait until
it's 3:00 in the morning

26:28.054 --> 26:29.922
and your kid's running 104.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.159
You're just getting started.

26:33.192 --> 26:35.227
That's the point,
I'm not starting.

26:35.261 --> 26:38.965
You know? And...
maybe I never will.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.300
Well, then fight for it, Palmer.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.770
That's what you do,
you fight for your family.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.137
And sometimes

26:45.171 --> 26:47.273
you fight like hell
just to have one.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.975
You want me to fight?
I feel like I just went

26:49.008 --> 26:50.276
ten rounds with Joe Louis.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.011
Do you want to be
a dad, Palmer?!

26:52.044 --> 26:54.647
Because, right now,
this is being a dad.

26:54.681 --> 26:55.682
Maybe I'm not ready.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.183
You wouldn't feel
the way you feel

26:57.216 --> 26:59.318
right now if you weren't ready.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.655
JIMMY:
And Gibbs was right.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.123
The best advice
I've ever gotten.

27:04.156 --> 27:05.858
Hugs or no hugs, I...

27:05.892 --> 27:08.260
I will never forget
his kindness that day.

27:08.294 --> 27:12.164
He cared. And, Ryan,
as tough as your father was,

27:12.198 --> 27:14.200
I'm sure if you think about it,
you can think of many times

27:14.233 --> 27:15.735
where he was just as kind.

27:17.403 --> 27:18.671
Yeah, try all the time.

27:18.705 --> 27:20.072
Yeah?

27:20.106 --> 27:23.075
Yeah, if anything,
he cared too much.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.178
I never questioned
whether he loved me, I just...

27:26.212 --> 27:29.315
I wasn't sure whether he knew
how much I loved him back.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.250
Oh, no, I am sure he did, Ryan.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.451
No, I mean, we fought too much.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.220
Right up
until today.

27:34.253 --> 27:38.691
All he wanted was to take me out
for my birthday, and...

27:38.725 --> 27:42.161
when he found out I'd been
laid off, he blew his top.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.832
Damn near caused an accident,
he was so angry.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.399
RYAN:
So pissed off,

27:47.433 --> 27:49.468
he cut off a whole mess
of cars in an intersection.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.837
Intersection?

27:50.870 --> 27:51.904
What intersection?

27:51.938 --> 27:54.006
Where? Palmer.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.275
Ask him where.
What intersection?

27:56.308 --> 27:58.277
Uh, Gibbs,
it's a one-way speaker.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.912
JIMMY: What intersection?
RYAN: It was, uh...

27:59.946 --> 28:01.280
It was around Raymere and Holt.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.282
How does he do that?
McGee.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.852
Traffic cams at Raymere
and Holt Street. On it, boss.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.253
And the surrounding
intersections.

28:07.286 --> 28:08.821
I'll call the DMV,
put a rush on it.

28:08.855 --> 28:09.455
I'm calling, too.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.357
Fine. Both of you call.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.392
But we need it now.

28:13.425 --> 28:16.328
ABBY: So, this is the
intersection in question,

28:16.362 --> 28:19.899
about five minutes
before Captain Smith was struck.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.169
McGEE:
Looks like his car there.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.204
Whoa. That was close.
Black SUV.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.106
ABBY:
Okay, I can't read the plate.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.340
Can we I.D. the driver?

28:30.009 --> 28:31.878
ABBY:
No.

28:31.911 --> 28:32.879
The windows are tinted.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.381
Boss, take a look at this.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.715
Abby, play it back.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.887
He's going after him.

28:40.920 --> 28:41.954
That's our guy.

28:41.988 --> 28:42.955
Could that be Commander Morgan?

28:42.989 --> 28:44.056
Or is it just road rage?

28:44.090 --> 28:45.124
Or both.

28:45.157 --> 28:46.959
One way to know. Find that car!

28:55.301 --> 28:58.337
Ah, that hit the spot.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.372
Any chance you need
a bathroom break?

29:00.406 --> 29:01.473
Nope.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.375
But, uh, you go right ahead.
(laughs)

29:03.409 --> 29:05.011
JIMMY:
No. No. I'm good.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.879
Been up there for three hours.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.281
QUINN: Think maybe it's time
to let the firefighters

29:09.315 --> 29:10.749
do their jobs, Gibbs.

29:13.052 --> 29:15.254
Tell them they can put
the pad out down below,

29:15.287 --> 29:16.355
nothing upstairs.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.389
Don't want to risk
Palmer's safety

29:17.423 --> 29:18.557
with any sudden moves.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.060
Boss, BOLO just paid off.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.895
State police just pulled
over Commander Morgan's SUV

29:22.929 --> 29:24.330
in Richmond;
they're holding him for us now.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.165
McGee, we can't
get there in time.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.101
I can set them up in MTAC.
Keep listening.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.339
You think that's
as big as it gets?

29:33.372 --> 29:35.908
Ah, a person could
easily miss that.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.577
Well, with my luck,
I'd try to miss

29:38.610 --> 29:40.246
and land square in the middle.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.580
I would call that good luck.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.782
I'm sure you would.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.121
Do you ever think that maybe
you are your own worst enemy?

29:49.155 --> 29:50.957
Constantly making fun
of yourself,

29:50.990 --> 29:52.558
comparing yourself
on social media.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.127
Maybe you are the only one
who's keeping score here, Ryan.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.263
It's my life. All right?
I know the score.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.431
Do you? Really?
What counts as a point?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.433
How about relationships?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.502
I've had my share.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.137
Nothing long-term.
Can't settle down

30:05.171 --> 30:06.538
until I get my career going.
Yeah, yeah.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.474
Of course.
Who came up with that rule?

30:08.507 --> 30:11.110
What do you want from me?
I want you to not jump.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.912
This conversation's
not helping!

30:12.945 --> 30:16.048
I-I'm just saying that if you
change how you measure success,

30:16.082 --> 30:17.516
you might actually opt
for happiness.

30:17.549 --> 30:20.452
What bumper sticker
laid that gem on you?

30:20.486 --> 30:22.554
Do you "opt for happiness"

30:22.588 --> 30:24.423
as an assistant
medical examiner?

30:24.456 --> 30:25.591
Like you never
wanted more?

30:25.624 --> 30:28.327
Of course I wanted more. I...

30:28.360 --> 30:31.297
As much as it scared me,
but be-be careful

30:31.330 --> 30:33.265
what you wish for and all that.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.968
JIMMY: Dr. Mallard.
How awesome you're here.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.469
Again.
Duck.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.472
Relax, Jethro.
I'm not here as M.E.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.342
Purely in
my consultant capacity.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.477
Well, I was just about
to tell Agent Gibbs

30:45.511 --> 30:47.346
about some nasty
old chemical burns

30:47.379 --> 30:50.082
I found on Sergeant Hill,
our most recent victim.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.451
I actually was able to work
backward from the contracture

30:52.484 --> 30:54.987
of the scarring to
establish a likely pH

30:55.021 --> 30:56.923
and molarity level of
the chemicals involved.

30:56.956 --> 30:59.425
Ah. Mm. Clever.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.061
Sergeant Hill likely got
these scars in a makeshift lab

31:02.094 --> 31:04.463
while trying to create
this poison.

31:04.496 --> 31:08.367
Making him our prime suspect.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.402
Oh, that's very clever.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.538
JIMMY:
Dr. Mallard's praise that day

31:12.571 --> 31:14.673
convinced me to finally
finish med school,

31:14.706 --> 31:16.442
and take the M.E. test.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.544
Really? What happened?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.249
What do you care, Ryan?

31:23.282 --> 31:25.517
Oh, yeah, fine. You got me.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.220
My dying wish is to know
whether you passed the test.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.389
No, I didn't.

31:30.422 --> 31:33.059
Not the first time
or the second time.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.660
That's why I never told
anyone at work.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.028
ABBY:
I need to talk to Gibbs.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.163
Is he still in MTAC?

31:37.196 --> 31:38.497
JIMMY:
They still don't know.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.298
RYAN:
Know what?

31:39.331 --> 31:42.534
About the third time,
when I passed.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.137
RYAN:
You passed the M.E.'s test?

31:45.171 --> 31:48.507
JIMMY: Yeah, I aced it.
It was so strange.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.342
I-I had spent so long
just trying to prove myself,

31:50.376 --> 31:51.577
trying to get ahead,

31:51.610 --> 31:53.479
and when I finally
passed the test,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.447
it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.950
I didn't want to go
anywhere else.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.451
I didn't want
to leave my friends.

31:59.485 --> 32:00.519
Especially not Dr. Mallard.

32:00.552 --> 32:03.956
I was happy
where I was.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.591
So you're an actual doctor?

32:05.624 --> 32:08.027
(stammers, chuckles)

32:08.060 --> 32:09.461
I am.

32:11.697 --> 32:15.134
But still,
nobody at work knows.

32:15.167 --> 32:19.171
We got a special dynamic;
I don't want to mess that up.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.207
But you could go anywhere.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.510
JIMMY: And I will one day.
Nothing lasts forever.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.980
I have had so many friends
come and go.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.515
And live and die.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.650
But where I'm right now,
with Dr. Mallard and Abby

32:31.683 --> 32:33.385
and the rest of our team

32:33.419 --> 32:36.255
working for what I really think
is a noble cause,

32:36.288 --> 32:39.225
why would I want
to leave that?

32:39.258 --> 32:40.459
I'd rather be happy.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.762
So every day, I put on my scrubs

32:43.795 --> 32:46.465
or this-this old jumpsuit,
I-I go to work,

32:46.498 --> 32:49.535
and I "opt for happiness."

32:49.568 --> 32:51.337
Come on.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.638
Uh, Abby?

32:54.640 --> 32:57.576
What's this about?
I left D.C. a few hours ago,

32:57.609 --> 32:58.577
heading to Carolina
to visit family.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.778
Is that a crime?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.247
No, sir, but may we ask

33:01.280 --> 33:02.581
why you had your cell phone
turned off?

33:02.614 --> 33:04.250
Didn't want any calls.

33:04.283 --> 33:05.717
Needing a few days
to get away from it all.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.786
Away from your run-in
with Captain Smith?

33:07.819 --> 33:11.357
Why'd he have to bring
NCIS into this?

33:11.390 --> 33:12.724
I apologized.
What did he tell you?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.626
You apologized
for what?

33:14.660 --> 33:17.363
Look, I was so blindsided
with the bad review and just...

33:17.396 --> 33:18.597
lost my cool.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.599
He threatened court-martial.

33:20.632 --> 33:24.136
Which was the captain losing
his cool, until I apologized.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.637
I never should have
said what I did.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.073
What'd you say?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.342
I called his kid a loser.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.444
Believe me,
I said a lot of other stuff,

33:32.478 --> 33:35.514
but that boy is his whole world.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.383
I had no business saying that.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.618
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.287
Commander. Stand by.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.688
Yeah.
Um, first, I think you should

33:42.721 --> 33:43.555
put Jimmy in for a raise.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.656
I'll second that.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.592
Okay. What else?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.528
I traced the partial plate
on from the SUV

33:49.561 --> 33:52.231
to a car rental place in D.C.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.266
The renter is
Edgar Stump.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.135
He's listed
as a part-time handyman.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.536
He has multiple DUIs

33:57.569 --> 34:00.139
and a vehicular harassment
conviction.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.573
So he is just a road-rager.

34:01.607 --> 34:02.741
He didn't even know
Captain Smith.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.610
Address.
ABBY:
Better than that.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.412
I've got his GPS signal.

34:06.445 --> 34:07.779
Send it to me.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.752
Way to jack up
your prices, Abdul!

34:17.456 --> 34:18.557
Ow, what the hell?

34:18.590 --> 34:19.658
Take it easy, Edgar.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.460
Why? I didn't do nothing.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.164
No, you did a lot.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.632
(handcuffs clicking)

34:29.435 --> 34:30.436
(exhales)
Hey.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.205
So nice and toasty inside.

34:35.774 --> 34:39.178
You know, there's no failure
in not killing yourself, right?

34:39.211 --> 34:40.779
There's not much
of a future either.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.348
Oh, sure, there is.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.749
Future's coming,
with or without you.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.151
You might as well be there.

34:45.184 --> 34:48.320
It'll be hell without my dad.

34:48.354 --> 34:51.357
No job. I-I got
some okay friends,

34:51.390 --> 34:52.891
but none like yours.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.693
And look at the world. I
mean, you turn on the news,

34:54.726 --> 34:56.428
and we're all so divided.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.497
Yelling and pointing fingers;
there's so much

34:58.530 --> 34:59.498
meanness out there.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.732
Stop looking for it.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.501
Who's looking for it?

35:02.534 --> 35:04.203
I mean, you can't
get away from it.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.704
Okay, well, then you look around
it. You look for the good.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.339
It's out there. I promise.

35:07.373 --> 35:10.409
I mean, i-if you find meanness,
you kill it with kindness.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.677
Oh, here we go.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.245
You're damn right, here we go.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.780
Open doors for strangers.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.715
You let a car go ahead of you
in traffic. Who cares?

35:16.748 --> 35:17.783
J-Just smile more.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.719
And if you want good friends,
be a good friend.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.654
They will find you,
I promise.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.923
Man, you could
go all night.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.725
But you don't have
an answer for my dad.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.727
(sighs) No, I...

35:28.760 --> 35:32.631
(grunts) No, I don't.

35:32.664 --> 35:37.603
But I have seen more dead people
than anyone you know.

35:37.636 --> 35:40.439
All of them gone too soon

35:40.472 --> 35:42.641
and none of them peaceful.

35:42.674 --> 35:43.509
No.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.245
I beg your pardon?

35:47.313 --> 35:48.747
No. I...

35:48.780 --> 35:50.716
I don't want to.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.221
You don't want
to what, Mr. Palmer?

35:57.256 --> 36:00.392
I don't want to know how
much her liver weighs.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.463
I don't want to catalog
her scars.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.698
(elevator bell dings)

36:08.834 --> 36:11.437
Most of all, I don't want
to cut open another friend.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.940
We only get the B-sides
on our table.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.709
And it is every day.

36:17.743 --> 36:20.879
I also see
their families, Ryan.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.850
Some of them let their loss
just knock 'em cold.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.519
And they drown in misery,
while others,

36:27.553 --> 36:29.821
they choose to make
their darkest hour

36:29.855 --> 36:31.557
their defining moment.

36:31.590 --> 36:33.859
They choose to take
something bad

36:33.892 --> 36:36.395
and turn it
into something good.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.896
Like your dad did.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.498
My dad?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.433
When he lost your mom,

36:41.467 --> 36:44.936
he chose to put
everything he had into you.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.872
Ryan...

36:46.905 --> 36:50.742
you are the something good
that he left behind.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.814
Now you got
the same choice to make.

36:57.516 --> 36:58.817
Ryan.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.819
The guy
who hit your dad--

37:00.852 --> 37:03.889
road-rager--
he didn't like being cut off.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.525
He'd have come after
your dad's car

37:06.558 --> 37:07.759
no matter where he stopped.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.761
Means it wasn't
your fault, Ryan.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.797
GIBBS:
Not your fault.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.931
You want to get this guy,

37:12.964 --> 37:14.866
we need you to testify
at the trial.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.303
Palmer.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.942
RYAN:
That's my dad's wallet.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.811
There's something in there
you're gonna want.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.856
My senior thesis project.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.425
Plenty of miles
on that photo.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.859
He showed it off
a lot.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.628
He was proud of you.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.062
Yeah.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.766
And what was it that
Dr. Mallard said earlier today?

37:47.799 --> 37:49.435
He said...

37:49.468 --> 37:52.070
"When you're going through hell,

37:52.103 --> 37:54.573
you keep going."

38:04.115 --> 38:06.452
You know I never would have
taken you with me, right?

38:06.485 --> 38:07.753
I know.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.090
Let's go inside.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.626
(softly):
Okay.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.528
Thanks, Jimmy.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.436
(whispers)

38:32.844 --> 38:34.913
(people cheering)

38:46.892 --> 38:48.460
I got you. (chuckles)

38:49.628 --> 38:50.962
Thanks, Nick.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.400
(panting)

38:55.734 --> 38:56.902
Told me not to let him fall.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.706
Hey.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.542
Good job out there.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.477
You were listening
the whole time?

39:07.112 --> 39:08.514
We all were.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.516
Dr. Mallard,
what are you doing here?

39:10.549 --> 39:12.418
Where else would I be?

39:12.451 --> 39:14.453
I'm not gonna leave you
out there alone...

39:14.486 --> 39:17.523
Dr. Palmer.

39:17.556 --> 39:18.957
(chuckles)

39:29.435 --> 39:31.437
Agent Gibbs,
you wanted to see me?

39:33.104 --> 39:34.773
Okay.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.477
Look, first of all,
I-I didn't know

39:38.510 --> 39:40.912
that you were listening
last night, and...

39:40.946 --> 39:44.416
I might have said some
things, some-some highly,

39:44.450 --> 39:47.052
deeply personal things about
you and your personal life,

39:47.085 --> 39:49.955
but I-I just, I just
shouldn't have.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.461
Gibbs, what I said about
your wife and daughter...

39:57.529 --> 40:00.198
I was just pulling out
all the stops.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.768
You know, and then once I got
on a roll, I couldn't stop.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.836
And then I...
