WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:05.046
* *

00:09.592 --> 00:12.053
(Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"
playing)

00:29.362 --> 00:31.865
KAT: All right.
Let's do it again from the top.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.324
We can cue music.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.660
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

00:35.702 --> 00:38.038
* Marry me, marry me,
say yes *

00:38.079 --> 00:39.456
* Marry me, marry me *

00:39.497 --> 00:42.000
* Say yes,
for the rest, the rest *

00:42.042 --> 00:43.793
* I never seen forever *

00:43.835 --> 00:46.129
* I never seen forever
in the wild *

00:46.171 --> 00:50.884
* But now I'm lookin',
now I'm lookin' in its eyes... *

00:50.925 --> 00:53.845
HODA KOTB: Tomorrow night,
superstar Kat Valdez

00:53.887 --> 00:56.931
and Grammy-winning
hot, hot, hot Bastian

00:56.973 --> 00:59.059
will make history
when they perform

00:59.100 --> 01:02.103
their new hit song "Marry Me"
and exchange vows

01:02.145 --> 01:04.773
in front of the whole world.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.150
-20 million people.
-(cheering)

01:07.192 --> 01:09.110
BASTIAN:
See you tomorrow.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.528
I'll be the one in the veil.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.822
And guess who's gonna
be one of them. Me!

01:12.864 --> 01:16.785
Okay, I hear that she is wearing
a Zuhair Murad custom gown

01:16.826 --> 01:19.579
with 10,000
hand-beaded crystals.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.539
I feel so grateful right now

01:21.581 --> 01:23.083
that everything is
the way it is.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.459
I have a beautiful fiancÃ©

01:24.501 --> 01:26.378
who's so supportive
and loving and...

01:26.419 --> 01:28.046
I feel so grateful
for the American fans because

01:28.088 --> 01:30.090
they are supporting me and Kat
in a very nice way.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.758
"Marry Me" is sweeping
the country.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.844
KAT: Planning the wedding show
has been insane.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.429
Strike that, the world.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.390
Kat Valdez and Bastian
are taking their vows onstage

01:38.431 --> 01:40.433
in New York City tomorrow night,

01:40.475 --> 01:42.227
and then jetting off
to a private island

01:42.268 --> 01:45.355
where they'll make, let's hope,
more beautiful music together.

01:45.397 --> 01:46.940
JUSTIN SYLVESTER:
City National Bank,

01:46.981 --> 01:49.275
bank of the stars,
presents "Marry Me."

01:49.317 --> 01:51.945
The end of a tour
and the beginning of a lifetime.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.656
And with me is Colin Calloway,
her manager. How are you?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.449
I'm very well, Justin.
How are you?

01:56.491 --> 01:59.285
I'm good. Now, I heard
this was all Bastian's idea.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.121
Uh, no, no, no,
they-they both wanted to give

02:01.162 --> 02:02.872
-something back to the fans.
-You know, combined,

02:02.914 --> 02:04.874
they have a social reach
of over 200 million people?

02:04.916 --> 02:07.502
Uh, yeah, of course I know that.
I'm-I'm the manager.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.713
-Uh... uh...
-Who's a bridesmaid?

02:09.754 --> 02:11.715
What about her exes?
Will they be in the audience?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.299
They got some people,
uh, waiting for me,

02:13.341 --> 02:14.259
so I'm just gonna go
and deal with that.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.052
-Just...
-Bye, guys.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.262
I hate dealing with managers.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.680
* Marry me *

02:18.722 --> 02:20.724
* I want you in my life so bad *

02:20.765 --> 02:22.809
* Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma *

02:22.851 --> 02:25.270
* Marry me. *

02:25.311 --> 02:26.855
WOMAN:
Can somebody get this cart?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.482
-Can somebody help me?
-(indistinct chatter)

02:31.151 --> 02:33.319
It's a gift from Pasquale Bruni.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.155
I mean, if you don't like it,
I'll take it.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.281
-Oh, that's beautiful.
-Ah!

02:36.322 --> 02:38.324
(both laughing)

02:38.366 --> 02:40.285
Um, let's pack it
for the honeymoon.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.494
-Okay.
-Okay?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.455
KAT:
Oh, more flowers.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.873
(chuckling):
My God, this is insane.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.750
This is nothing.
There's a moving van on Park

02:46.791 --> 02:49.336
stuffed with wedding gifts,
including a stove.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.796
-Someone got me a stove?
-It's from a fan.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.382
(scoffs) Who thinks
I don't have a stove?

02:54.424 --> 02:55.425
COLIN:
Yeah, Tyra?

02:55.467 --> 02:56.968
Donate all of it.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.680
-("Marry Me" ringtone plays)
-Oh, it's Tom from iHeartRadio.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.516
Tom, the man himself.
Talk to me.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.352
Of course I've got
some tickets for you,

03:05.393 --> 03:06.853
even if we are
completely sold out.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.772
I don't think there's
a single person in this city

03:08.813 --> 03:10.690
who's not clamoring
to come to this wedding.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.443
Think this is
one of my better lunches,

03:13.485 --> 03:15.236
but you be the judge.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.863
Dad, don't mess up my hair.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.448
I thought that gave you
good luck.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.408
That was, like, a long time ago.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.869
I think it was
about a month ago.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.537
How great is this?

03:24.579 --> 03:28.041
Going to the same school
together.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.418
-Mm-hmm, great.
-Oh, and, Lou, you probably

03:30.460 --> 03:31.878
won't see that much of me.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.297
I know that could be
a problem for you,

03:34.339 --> 03:36.883
but if you need
to see me anytime...

03:36.925 --> 03:37.759
I won't.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.886
I like the independence. Good.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.930
Oh, and you know the student
that you're shadowing, Esther?

03:41.971 --> 03:44.849
Full disclosure,
Esther is in my math club,

03:44.891 --> 03:49.020
but I don't want you to feel
any pressure to join.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.397
I'm not joining.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.773
Tough audience.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.402
(snoring)

03:55.443 --> 03:57.821
(kids chattering)

03:57.862 --> 03:59.948
Um, Dad?

04:00.782 --> 04:02.992
-Can I go in alone?
-Of course.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.078
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.540
If I could walk in alone,
you know, for my street cred.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.876
I love you!

04:15.880 --> 04:20.218
You may be good at football,
you may be good at track,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.387
but when it comes
to math clubs...

04:22.429 --> 04:25.015
ALL:
You better watch your back!

04:25.056 --> 04:28.184
Coolidge Pi-thons attack!

04:28.226 --> 04:30.020
-(hissing)
-Yes!

04:30.061 --> 04:31.396
What's our number?

04:31.438 --> 04:35.900
ALL:
3.141592...

04:35.942 --> 04:38.111
-(school bell rings)
-65839...

04:38.153 --> 04:39.612
Percy, we got it. Good.

04:39.654 --> 04:42.949
Okay, remember,
if you sit in the question,

04:42.991 --> 04:44.659
the answer will find you.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.661
Terrific job today.
I love the energy.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.121
I'm telling you,
if we bring that

04:48.163 --> 04:50.623
to the Mathalon finals,
we win the...

04:50.665 --> 04:52.584
-Oh, Esther, you got a second?
-Yeah.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.461
How's Lou doing? She good?

04:54.502 --> 04:55.920
I think so.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.630
You know, she's great at math,
so at some point,

04:57.672 --> 04:59.299
I wouldn't be surprised
if she starts asking

04:59.341 --> 05:00.717
about maybe joining
the Pi-thons.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.427
'Cause, you know,
at her last school,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.304
she made it
to the Mathalon finals.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.181
Really?
She never mentioned that.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.141
Ah, you know, that's the thing.
She's really shy.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.685
Oh, not at all. She was
telling me about her vacation

05:10.727 --> 05:12.771
and about this guy named David.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.773
David? My ex's new husband?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.691
-What did she say about him?
-Oh...

05:16.733 --> 05:18.234
It doesn't matter. Never mind.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.154
Actually, go ahead. Tell me.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.614
Oh, just that he's awesome

05:22.655 --> 05:24.574
and no matter what they do,
it's always cool

05:24.616 --> 05:27.077
-and exciting and, you know...
-Fun.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.453
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-Gotcha.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
-All right.
-Okay. Thanks, Esther.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.749
I guess they're going
cave diving.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.877
-Hmm. Cave diving.
-Yeah.

05:36.920 --> 05:40.048
-(door opens, closes)
-Where?

05:40.090 --> 05:41.966
PARKER: In a stairwell,
spying on your daughter.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.510
-Really?
-CHARLIE: We're not spying.

05:43.551 --> 05:46.179
We're-we're just watching
from a distance.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.722
We're not spying.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.766
Look, she had a hard time
at her last school.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.518
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.396
So, what, you thought you'd
hook her up with the cool kids?

05:54.437 --> 05:57.065
CHARLIE: Parker, you're
supposed to set a good example

05:57.107 --> 05:58.858
as the guidance counselor.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.570
I am setting the best example
with my look and my vibe alone.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.116
Jesus, kids still do the robot?

06:06.157 --> 06:07.867
(ringtone playing):
* Marry me, marry me, say... *

06:07.909 --> 06:10.245
-Is that a "Marry Me" ringtone?
-Guilty.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.287
What's "Marry Me"?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.206
It's Kat and Bastian's new song.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.916
-It's everyone's new song.
-It's my new song.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.793
-It's not mine.
-People are gonna propose to it.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.294
They're gonna post videos
of themselves

06:18.336 --> 06:19.796
dancing to it down the aisle.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.381
-Are you ready to be jealous?
-Yes.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.384
I'm taking my new girlfriend
Roxy and her ex-girlfriend

06:24.426 --> 06:25.677
-to their concert/wedding.
-Shut up.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.971
Where she's gonna look
at me and say...

06:28.013 --> 06:29.305
Hi, baby.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.724
BASTIAN (over phone):
Hi, love.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.977
-Did you see my post?
-No. You post something?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.067
(chuckles)

06:41.109 --> 06:43.361
So, do you like it?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.655
I love it.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.365
I love you.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.034
I love you more, baby.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.201
(inhales deeply)

06:50.243 --> 06:52.203
-When'll you be home?
-About an hour.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.913
You know there's about
a thousand people

06:53.955 --> 06:55.790
-in this apartment right now?
-(laughing): What?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.668
I know.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.255
20 million?

07:02.297 --> 07:03.798
(chuckles) Yeah, of course.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.593
Oh, my God. This has gotten
so out of control.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.428
(man speaks Spanish over phone)

07:08.470 --> 07:10.013
BASTIAN:
Yo, I'm on with Kat. Wait.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.806
Yeah, I just...

07:11.848 --> 07:15.143
now I just wish it was me
and you on a beach somewhere.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.686
No, my love.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.397
You deserve the biggest wedding
in the world.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.151
And tomorrow's gonna be
the best night of our lives.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.780
-Can't wait. (chuckles)
-I can't wait either, baby.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.495
MELISSA:
Where's Kat?

07:33.536 --> 07:35.789
An interview in ten minutes.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.375
(horns honking)

07:38.416 --> 07:40.126
CHARLIE:
Look what I just found.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.378
Scoot over. (grunts)

07:41.419 --> 07:43.463
I was just looking
through some old pictures.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.924
-Uh-huh?
-And look at this one I saw

07:45.965 --> 07:49.302
of you, me and Mom
in Jamaica, parasailing.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.720
We went parasailing?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.305
Do you not remember?

07:52.347 --> 07:53.640
I mean, to be honest,

07:53.682 --> 07:55.475
I don't remember you
together at all.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.810
(grunts softly)

07:56.851 --> 08:00.230
Well, we were, and we had fun.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.982
I get it, Dad.
You were a fun guy.

08:03.024 --> 08:07.445
I was, and I am a fun guy.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.156
(takes deep breath)

08:10.198 --> 08:12.325
But, you know,

08:12.367 --> 08:15.328
it's not just about fun.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.122
It's-it's harder than that.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.332
It's work. It's...

08:19.374 --> 08:21.918
Well, think about Tank.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.920
-When Tank was a puppy.
-(chuckles)

08:23.962 --> 08:25.338
-You remember that?
-Yeah.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.798
You remember how fun he was

08:26.840 --> 08:28.675
and playing tug-of-war
with the Frisbee

08:28.717 --> 08:30.677
and him jumping around?

08:30.719 --> 08:34.347
And now he's old,
and his eyes don't work,

08:34.389 --> 08:36.975
and you don't know
how many good years he has left,

08:37.017 --> 08:39.185
-but you still...
-Dad, is Tank dying?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.854
No. No.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.523
I'm sorry, I-I... Tank's good.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.734
I got a little off track.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.361
I was just...
What I meant is that

08:48.403 --> 08:52.198
love is about sacrifice
and the day-to-day.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.160
Um, Dad, uh,
can I go to sleep now?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.746
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.664
-Okay. Good night.
-Okay.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.291
Night.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.630
JIMMY FALLON: Last time
she was here, Kat Valdez,

09:07.672 --> 09:10.258
who let's just say
is no stranger to weddings...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.885
(audience laughing)

09:11.926 --> 09:13.970
...said she wanted to do
something smaller,

09:14.012 --> 09:16.222
understated, intimate,

09:16.264 --> 09:19.017
with just, say,
5,000 of their closest fans.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.603
-(laughter)
-I mean friends.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.397
Just a simple wedding
for a simple gal.

09:24.439 --> 09:27.275
-Just like Mom's wedding was.
-(laughter)

09:27.317 --> 09:29.110

09:43.458 --> 09:45.210
"Of the wide world
I stand alone, and think

09:45.251 --> 09:49.130
Till love and fame
to nothingness do sink."

09:49.172 --> 09:51.716
It's Keats.
You think he'll like it?

09:51.758 --> 09:54.344
If somebody explains it
to him, yeah.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.929
It's beautiful.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.640
Oh, today is your wedding day!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.102
Get it, get it, get it.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.687
Tomorrow would've been
our anniversary.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.563
You guys went out
for what, two weeks?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.108
17 days,
if you include the breakup.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.568
And she dumped me with a text.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.112
So rude.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.156
Come to the Kat Valdez concert
with me tonight.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.243
Parker, I'm not
a big concert person.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.079
Listen, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime invitation,

10:21.121 --> 10:22.789
and you don't even get it.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.541
This is Halley's Comet.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.668
It's you wearing an outfit
that flatters your body.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.794
It's very rare.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.421
Okay, I've got Lou tonight.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.214
Good. I've got three tickets.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.716
Bring her.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.052
Maybe she'll think you're fun.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.596

special occasion.

Are there any Latinos
in the house?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.280
(cheering)

13:21.343 --> 13:25.013
That beautiful woman
is gonna be my wife.

13:26.056 --> 13:28.058
I should've worn my onesie.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.976
(laughs) Charlie.

13:30.018 --> 13:32.270
(singing in Spanish)

13:42.655 --> 13:43.698
Yeah.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.824

Oh. I know the groom is not

14:34.541 --> 14:36.584
supposed to see the bride
before the wedding.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.588
Kat Valdez's
husband-to-be Bastian

15:21.629 --> 15:25.258

she was gonna do this.

17:02.605 --> 17:03.732
Beautiful.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.442
So it's only natural

17:10.947 --> 17:13.742
Probably didn't know
about this either, did you?

17:13.783 --> 17:15.994
Only natural
that I say something,

17:16.036 --> 17:18.371
if not about marriage,

17:18.413 --> 17:20.832
then about... love.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.917

actually is.

17:48.610 --> 17:50.570
MAN:
It's okay! We love you!

17:50.612 --> 17:53.114
A fairy tale that
you sold yourself so long ago

17:53.156 --> 17:56.451
that you forgot
that wasn't real.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.416
But deep down, you knew.

We love you, Kat.

-No.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.012
KAT:
Somehow you knew.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.390
You did that.

18:18.431 --> 18:22.977
You realize that
it wasn't love at all.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.021
You were just in love

18:25.063 --> 18:29.275
with the idea of who
you wanted that person to be.

18:29.317 --> 18:32.821
But you can't marry an idea.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.325
(audience murmuring)

18:39.994 --> 18:42.205
You know, they say,
if you want something different,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.833
you have to do
something different.

18:46.710 --> 18:51.214
So this time,
for the first time,

18:51.256 --> 18:53.508
you make a different choice.

18:55.176 --> 18:59.931
You jump off a cliff so high
you can't even see the fall.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.186
And you just...

19:13.903 --> 19:16.322
...say yes.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.084
Why not?

19:28.126 --> 19:30.253
Sure.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.882
I'll marry you.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.508
You.

I thought it would be Bastian,

19:41.556 --> 19:43.433
but it's just some guy
wearing a windbreaker.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.268
Maybe he's a celebrity
wearing a mask.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.561
-Is this for real?
-Yeah, it's for real!

19:46.603 --> 19:48.188

20:14.130 --> 20:16.383
(cheering)

20:18.677 --> 20:20.929
(organ playing
Wagner's "Bridal Chorus")

20:29.312 --> 20:31.940
Oh, my God.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.908
Do you, Katrina Valdez,

20:41.950 --> 20:45.078
take this guy to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.248
And I mean really take him.
Think hard, girl.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.041
(audience murmuring)

20:51.793 --> 20:53.420
-I do.
-WOMAN: Wait, what?

20:53.461 --> 20:56.548
-(audience gasping)
-And do you, some guy,

20:56.589 --> 21:00.010
take Kat to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

21:00.051 --> 21:01.261
WOMAN:
No! Bastian!

21:01.302 --> 21:02.512
-MAN: Do it!
-OTHERS: Yeah!

21:02.554 --> 21:04.764
(scattered shouts)

21:04.806 --> 21:06.766
It's on you, bro.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.816
WOMAN:
Say yes!

21:14.858 --> 21:16.109
Okay.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.570
-We'll take "okay."
-(scattered shouts)

21:18.611 --> 21:21.489
By the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

21:21.531 --> 21:23.992
I now declare you...
(whispers in Spanish)

21:24.034 --> 21:25.952
...husband and wife.

21:25.994 --> 21:28.955
(scattered cheers)

21:28.997 --> 21:31.791
(cheering swells)

21:35.462 --> 21:37.881

21:37.922 --> 21:39.632
(cheering fades)

21:52.103 --> 21:54.647
(cheering)

21:57.734 --> 21:58.777
Kat.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.362
Get the hell away from me.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.821
-Can I just explain...
-I'm serious!

22:01.863 --> 22:03.907
-Get her out of here!
-MAN: Clear this area.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.909
-Everybody out, please.
-MAN 2: What's going on?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.744
What happened?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.497
Baby...

22:13.541 --> 22:14.751
Screw you, Bastian!

22:14.793 --> 22:16.252
BASTIAN:
We got in that fight in Miami,

22:16.294 --> 22:17.337
then you told me to get out.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.421
Oh, so this is all my fault?

22:18.463 --> 22:19.673
It's nothing. It was nothing.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.174
-Get me out of here.
-(speaks Spanish)

22:21.216 --> 22:22.842
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, just...
Whoa, just... -Wait.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.720
Who the hell do you think
you are, man? Some fan?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.681
No, I'm not a fan. Just...

22:27.722 --> 22:29.140
Well, I mean, I am now.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.684
Okay. We're done.
You lot, get your phones down.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.644
-Show's over. Go, go, go.
-(clamoring)

22:32.686 --> 22:33.895
Carl, take these two
round the back.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.313
I'll have you send decoys
round the front.

22:35.355 --> 22:36.523
-Listen.
-Just get him out of here!

22:36.564 --> 22:38.066
(clamoring)

22:38.108 --> 22:39.484
Hey, move. Move.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.735
Hold him there. Hold him there.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.695
-Terry, I'm-I'm good.
-Whoa, whoa.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.613
(clamoring continues)

22:44.489 --> 22:46.825
(cameras clicking rapidly)

22:49.077 --> 22:50.578
(Kat panting softly)

23:03.633 --> 23:05.802
* *

23:09.014 --> 23:11.057
That was crazy.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.564
I'm sorry.
I don't know exactly what to say

23:17.605 --> 23:20.233
or what just happened,
but I know on some level

23:20.275 --> 23:23.069
you must have really cared
about that guy.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.740
I was marrying him.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.534
Good point.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.208
He's going to age badly.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.255
No, he's not.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.798
Yeah, you're right.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.343
He's probably just gonna
get better looking.

23:46.384 --> 23:48.720
(chuckles)

23:52.349 --> 23:54.934
I'm really sorry about all this.

23:57.395 --> 23:59.481
Me, too.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.994
You gonna be okay?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.790
Jeff will take you home.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.958
Okay. Good night.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.674
(cell phone buzzing)

24:28.593 --> 24:30.470
PARKER (over phone):
Charlie, finally.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.971
Hey. How's Lou?

24:32.013 --> 24:33.932
She's fine. She's at her mom's.
Where are you?

24:33.973 --> 24:35.809
I'm in a garage.
I'm on my way home.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.644
Hold on. You're saying
you haven't seen it?

24:37.686 --> 24:39.312
(chuckling): Oh, my God.
You are everywhere.

24:39.354 --> 24:40.897
Online, on television, on...

24:40.939 --> 24:42.440
What do you mean "television"?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.150
FALLON (on TV): Did you hear
Kat Valdez got married

24:44.192 --> 24:45.860
to a different stranger
at the concert tonight?

24:45.902 --> 24:47.320
-Do you believe that?
-(audience laughing on TV)

24:47.362 --> 24:49.030
On the way home
from the concert tonight,

24:49.072 --> 24:51.199
Kat Valdez also left
the guy from the concert,

24:51.241 --> 24:53.535
then married her Uber driver,
and then...

24:53.576 --> 24:55.036
(audience laughing)

24:55.078 --> 24:57.122
Now he's-he's driving them
to the honeymoon

24:57.163 --> 24:59.332
in Turks and Caicos, where
she will marry the bellboy.

24:59.374 --> 25:02.460
It's very... It's all...
It's all happening...

25:02.502 --> 25:04.546
REPORTER:
Kat Valdez y Bastian...

25:04.587 --> 25:06.923
(reporter continues in Spanish)

25:06.965 --> 25:08.717
(sighs)

25:08.758 --> 25:10.719
COLIN:
There you are.

25:14.472 --> 25:16.224
You need anything?

25:20.812 --> 25:22.313
KAT:
Just...

25:22.355 --> 25:24.774
tell me it didn't happen.

25:25.984 --> 25:28.945
Why do I always pick
the wrong guy?

25:32.907 --> 25:34.951
I let everyone down.

25:34.993 --> 25:37.704
-No, no. No, you didn't.
-(Kat sniffling, sobbing)

25:37.746 --> 25:39.664
I can't get out of my own way.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.583
Oh, come here. Come here.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.251
It's all right.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.712
-We'll figure it out.
-(sobbing)

25:45.754 --> 25:47.255
I promise.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.758
I promise.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.469
We'll figure it out.

25:52.510 --> 25:55.680
Well, the good news is
there was a wedding last night.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.808
The bad news is
it was not a joke.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.477
I have two things to say.

26:00.518 --> 26:02.062
First, Kat, we love you...

26:02.103 --> 26:03.313
It's Bastian.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.898
He says he just needs
five minutes.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.608
Hang up and turn that off.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.485
I got to go.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.362
God, he's unbelievable.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.613
What now?

26:11.654 --> 26:13.031
Well, he's going to Puerto Rico.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.824
He says he needs to get
his head together.

26:14.866 --> 26:15.950
(scoffs) Whatever.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.577
(sighs) Kat, he was crying.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.371
Not helping.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.997
(Colin grunts softly)

26:24.417 --> 26:26.294
COLIN:
You all right?

26:26.336 --> 26:27.712
KAT:
No.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.090
Okay, well, I did
a bit of digging last night,

26:30.131 --> 26:32.759
and it turns out, out of 10,000
potential dumpster fires,

26:32.801 --> 26:35.261
you picked a decent,
straight, single father

26:35.303 --> 26:37.389
with no criminal record,
and get this,

26:37.430 --> 26:38.515
he's a maths teacher.

26:38.556 --> 26:39.891
-And that's good?
-It's great.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.267
He's not gonna be a problem.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.560
I say we offer $5,000,

26:42.602 --> 26:45.939
get him to sign an NDA
and let it all blow over.

26:48.024 --> 26:49.150
Or...

26:50.110 --> 26:51.820
Or?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.782
Or I could stay married to him.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.327
(laughs)

26:59.369 --> 27:00.745
You're kidding.

27:01.496 --> 27:03.790
You're kidding.

27:04.582 --> 27:05.750
You're not kidding.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.293
Y-You can't. We can't.

27:07.335 --> 27:08.628
It-it's not legal.

27:08.670 --> 27:09.921
We didn't file papers.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.381
So file the papers.

27:11.423 --> 27:12.590
Wha...

27:13.466 --> 27:15.552
I mean, play the record
through here.

27:15.593 --> 27:16.928
I started something last night,

27:16.970 --> 27:19.514
and if I don't finish it,
I look crazy.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.266
"Er." You'll look crazier.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.517
(Kat exhales)

27:22.559 --> 27:24.310
(whispers):
Namaste.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.479
Yeah, we got to get out
in front of this.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.190
Now, he thinks he can
publicly humiliate me?

27:29.232 --> 27:30.483
Screw him.

27:30.525 --> 27:34.029
This is a manic response
to an insane situation.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.156
No, we have to change
the narrative.

27:36.197 --> 27:37.991
All right?
I'm not marrying him forever.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.994
It's just for a month,
a... a few months.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.787
Now, presuming
the man you married

27:42.829 --> 27:45.331
doesn't have
a girlfriend or a life,

27:45.373 --> 27:47.459
and presuming
I can get him to agree,

27:47.500 --> 27:50.420
I'm not sure exactly
what we're telling the world.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.339
You don't want to be a joke.

27:53.131 --> 27:56.092
I don't want to be
the punch line.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.346
We have to embrace
the spontaneity of the moment

27:59.387 --> 28:01.222
and just say...

28:03.516 --> 28:06.061
"Nothing else has worked.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.274
Maybe this will."

28:18.156 --> 28:19.991
You know what they say to do

28:20.033 --> 28:21.951
when your car's skidding
out of control, Colin?

28:21.993 --> 28:25.121
Close your eyes and pray?

28:26.623 --> 28:29.084
Hit the gas and turn into it.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.585
Wait, what are you saying?

28:30.627 --> 28:32.003
Rethink the paradigm.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.005
We're not selling the world
a fairy tale.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.674
We're taking the fairy tale
off the table.

28:35.715 --> 28:36.883
That's what you did last night.

28:36.925 --> 28:38.551
-That's what I did?
-Yeah.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.553
Look, I was just trying
to help someone who seemed like

28:40.595 --> 28:42.180
they were in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

28:42.222 --> 28:43.723
We're calling it
a break from tradition.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.559
A moment of clarity where
she picked you out of a crowd

28:46.601 --> 28:48.853
and you, my friend, picked her.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.730
I don't even know her.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.233
Kat Valdez is a legend.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.234
Self-made.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.902
She was raised
by a single father

28:55.944 --> 28:57.946
who died before she had
any kind of success.

28:57.987 --> 28:59.698
Now she's a woman north of 35

28:59.739 --> 29:01.991
in a business that marginalizes
women at any age.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.952
People love their artists
to bare their souls,

29:03.993 --> 29:05.662
then vilify them
if they go too far.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.914
Well, I'm not gonna let them
do that to her.

29:07.956 --> 29:10.083
-And I'm asking you to help me.
-How?

29:10.125 --> 29:12.794
Stand beside her
for three months.

29:12.836 --> 29:13.878
And what does she think
about this?

29:13.920 --> 29:15.213
It was her idea.

29:15.255 --> 29:18.091
-She had the idea for...
-Yeah.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.260
What if we offered you $10,000?

29:20.301 --> 29:22.595
No, no, no. Wrong approach.

29:22.637 --> 29:24.472
Offer him, like, a fundraiser.

29:24.514 --> 29:25.557
He'll go for that.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.225
(chuckling):
Oh. Hi.

29:27.267 --> 29:28.977
Uh, I'm sorry. Are you two...

29:29.019 --> 29:30.478
Ew, gross. No.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.106
Parker Debs, guidance counselor.
Same school.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.650
How about, uh, we host
a fundraiser for your math club?

29:35.692 --> 29:37.610
Don't answer that. Okay.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.279
What about if it's, like,

29:39.320 --> 29:41.948
instead of three months,
it's six months,

29:41.990 --> 29:44.242
and it could be, like,
a whole math wing?

29:44.284 --> 29:46.786
-(chuckles) -I'm thinking
about the children.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.079
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.622
I don't think
anyone's gonna believe

29:49.664 --> 29:51.958
that she's gonna go
from Bastian to me.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.460
-That's a good point.
-Well, the fact is

29:53.501 --> 29:55.337
that she did go
from Bastian to you.

29:55.378 --> 29:56.588
Counterpoint.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.298
COLIN: We're not pretending
you're in love.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.966
We're just gonna say
that you're getting

30:00.008 --> 30:01.718
to know each other,
and if it goes further,

30:01.760 --> 30:02.844
then great, and if it doesn't...

30:02.886 --> 30:04.429
It won't. Come...

30:04.471 --> 30:06.973
-Not with that attitude.
-Well, then it doesn't have to.

30:07.015 --> 30:09.642
This is about this moment.

30:09.684 --> 30:13.146
Managing the media frenzy
until things die down.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.731
I have a daughter.

30:14.773 --> 30:17.650
I don't want to drag her
into the middle of a circus.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.778
I can assure you,
we won't impinge

30:19.819 --> 30:22.197
on your life whatsoever.

30:22.238 --> 30:23.698
-(clamoring) -How does it feel
to not be a nobody?

30:23.740 --> 30:25.617
How do you feel about her
being so much hotter

30:25.658 --> 30:27.660
-than you, Charlie?
-Hey, Charlie! Right here!

30:27.702 --> 30:28.912
Hey, Charlie, are you gonna
go through with this?

30:28.953 --> 30:29.996
Where's the honeymoon?

30:30.038 --> 30:31.706
Did you get a good look at him?

30:31.748 --> 30:33.333
Yeah. He's cute.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.417
What?

30:34.459 --> 30:36.461
-He's fine.
-COLIN: Hey.

30:36.503 --> 30:39.089
Charlie, come in.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.924
Oh, she's right there. Jesus.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.842
Come over, guys.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.803
Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.596
-Hi. Oh.
-How are you? Oh.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.014
(Charlie chuckles)

30:48.056 --> 30:50.392
-Okay. (laughs)
-I'm Parker.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.894
I'm... I am the one who brought
Charlie to the concert,

30:52.936 --> 30:54.354
-so I'm-I'm...
-CHARLIE: Yep.

30:54.396 --> 30:55.605
Basically,
I guess I'm responsible

30:55.647 --> 30:56.981
-for this whole thing.
-(laughter)

30:57.023 --> 30:58.525
Hi, Parker.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.776
Hey, Kat.

30:59.818 --> 31:00.777
Hi.

31:00.819 --> 31:02.362
Would you do me a favor,

31:02.404 --> 31:04.322
uh, just two seconds,
and just say,

31:04.364 --> 31:05.699
-"Roxy, you really blew it"?
-CHARLIE: Oh. Oh.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.451
Today Showis a go
at 10:00 on Tuesday.

31:08.493 --> 31:10.036
-(whispers): Sorry.
-MELISSA: They want, uh, um...

31:10.078 --> 31:11.413
Um, Charlie.

31:11.454 --> 31:14.499
Charlie in studio
and Kat remote from London.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.376
-Kat.
-Excuse me one second.

31:16.418 --> 31:18.003
-I just have to take a call.
-Okay.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.671
-Bye, Kat.
-WOMAN: Everything's set up...

31:19.713 --> 31:21.923
-She's like a real person.
-All right, so what's going on?

31:21.965 --> 31:23.550
Uh, we're booking interviews
all week.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.176
Uh-huh.
I thought that's what today was.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.553
No, no. Today's more of
a press conference.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.054
But throughout
the next few weeks,

31:28.096 --> 31:29.597
we're gonna have
some sit-downs and B roll

31:29.639 --> 31:31.307
and news outlets following us,
charting the progress

31:31.349 --> 31:33.018
as you two
get to know each other.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.185
It's all in your email.

31:34.227 --> 31:35.895
I don't check my emails a lot.

31:35.937 --> 31:38.231
How do you schedule your life
if you don't check your email?

31:39.024 --> 31:40.567
Easy. I can't do anything

31:40.608 --> 31:42.902
between 8:00 and 3:00
Monday through Friday,

31:42.944 --> 31:44.529
and I have math club
after school,

31:44.571 --> 31:46.406
and three days a week,
I have my kid.

31:46.448 --> 31:48.283
-Beyond that, I'm pretty much
available. -(groans)

31:48.324 --> 31:50.744
-So, sorry...
-Melissa.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.829
Melissa, you're gonna
have to move The Today Show.

31:52.871 --> 31:53.955
What? Excuse me?

31:53.997 --> 31:55.290
We don't move The Today Show.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.709
We move for The Today Show.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.085
He's gonna have to
shift his schedule.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.211
Okay, I'll-I'll handle it.

32:00.253 --> 32:02.088
Okay, I can handle my own life.

32:02.130 --> 32:03.590
I can help him handle it.

32:03.631 --> 32:06.259
Uh, Melissa, shouldn't you
be posting Vitamix?

32:06.301 --> 32:08.011
That's Tyra's job.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.804
Oh. Right.

32:09.846 --> 32:11.514
Morning, everybody.
I don't know about you guys,

32:11.556 --> 32:13.433
but when I get up in the
morning, I like to meditate.

32:13.475 --> 32:16.019
I also love to have fresh juice.

32:16.061 --> 32:18.396
So I like to juice daily
with my Vitamix.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.775
I take my fresh greens,
mix and go.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.485
Okay, look, I hate
to interrupt an artist

32:23.526 --> 32:25.362
while she's juicing,
but we're gonna have to draw

32:25.403 --> 32:27.238
a hard line
when it comes to the students

32:27.280 --> 32:29.115
-and the schedule, okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

32:29.157 --> 32:31.117
You're a little shiny.

32:31.159 --> 32:33.495
MELISSA:
Awesome. Let's take a selfie.

32:33.536 --> 32:34.621
(camera clicks)

32:34.662 --> 32:36.081
I don't feel comfortable.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.375
-I really don't feel like
this is my world. -It's natural.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.293
It just feels like
everyone walking around

32:40.335 --> 32:41.628
is, like, a sycophant.

32:41.670 --> 32:43.963
Everything in her life
is sponsored.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.841
-I know, but don't ruin this
for me. -No, but listen to me.

32:46.883 --> 32:48.802
-I...
-COLIN: Hey.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.637
-How we doing?
-I'm sorry.

32:50.679 --> 32:52.722
I don't... I don't think
it's gonna work out.

32:52.764 --> 32:53.890
It's just perspective.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.517
No, it's not just perspective.

32:55.558 --> 32:57.644
You see her as some pop star
with endorsement deals,

32:57.686 --> 32:59.020
a narcissist who takes
meaningless selfies,

32:59.062 --> 33:00.522
but that's not the full...

33:00.563 --> 33:02.357
Well, I mean, is a selfie
ever meaningful? I mean...

33:02.399 --> 33:03.483
Look up.

33:03.525 --> 33:05.151
Look, I-I don't mean
to be negative,

33:05.193 --> 33:07.404
but I'm not
a big social media person.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.406
I feel it's kind of
a distorted reality.

33:09.447 --> 33:11.491
I'm so glad I came
to your TED Talk.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.827
No, come on. I see it
all the time in my students.

33:13.868 --> 33:15.745
-It's... (sighs)
-MELISSA: Kat's ready to walk.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.163
Okay, she's ready.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.540
COLIN: Social media
can also reach people.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.417
-No, I know. Yeah.
-It can be a tool.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.419
You know what a tool is,
though, right, Charlie?

33:22.460 --> 33:25.046
-Okay. Thank you, Melissa.
-PARKER: Burn.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.341
I know this is a lot.

33:28.383 --> 33:30.343
Just go out there
and be yourself.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.303
Myself probably wouldn't
be here, but...

33:32.345 --> 33:34.222
Listen, if you don't
want to do this...

33:34.264 --> 33:37.475
Uh, what, then I leave?

33:37.517 --> 33:39.060
I thought you said
he was into this.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.062
-COLIN: He is.
-He can hear you.

33:41.104 --> 33:42.188
COLIN:
Ladies and gentlemen,

33:42.230 --> 33:44.274
Kat Valdez and her new husband,

33:44.315 --> 33:45.567
Charlie Gilbert.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.777
-(applause)
-(cameras clicking)

33:51.614 --> 33:53.199
REPORTER:
So, you think it's romantic

33:53.241 --> 33:54.534
marrying a complete stranger?

33:54.576 --> 33:58.163
Uh, impulsive, without a plan.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.206
But, hey, look where
my plans got me.

34:00.248 --> 34:01.291
(laughter)

34:01.332 --> 34:02.584
So, you just

34:02.625 --> 34:04.377
threw caution to the wind
and thought...

34:04.419 --> 34:06.629
I didn't think, actually.

34:06.671 --> 34:07.714
It was a moment.

34:07.756 --> 34:09.382
You're banking a lifetime
on a moment?

34:09.424 --> 34:11.509
No, I'm banking
a moment on a moment.

34:11.551 --> 34:14.471
Get enough of those,
and that's a lifetime.

34:14.512 --> 34:15.889
You know nothing
about each other.

34:15.930 --> 34:17.390
Did you think twice?

34:17.432 --> 34:18.475
Charlie?

34:18.516 --> 34:20.352
Mm, people meet randomly
all the time.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.228
At a... at a bar or...

34:22.270 --> 34:23.772
Online.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.440
Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.275
-(laughing)
-CHARLIE: Uh...

34:27.317 --> 34:29.402
I mean, why is this any crazier?

34:29.444 --> 34:32.113
To state the obvious,
you got married.

34:34.157 --> 34:36.451
Yeah, and...

34:36.493 --> 34:39.245
Now we get to know each other.

34:39.287 --> 34:41.998
-But not as man and wife?
-KAT: Uh, no.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.750
That would be nuts. (chuckles)

34:43.792 --> 34:45.126
Just for her.

34:45.168 --> 34:47.754
For me, it would be
pretty amazing.

34:47.796 --> 34:49.297
(laughter)

34:49.339 --> 34:51.091
Last night,
I held up a friend's sign

34:51.132 --> 34:53.385
asking a woman to marry me,

34:53.426 --> 34:57.764
and she said yes,
and I did, and...

34:59.224 --> 35:00.850
...you know, I did it not,

35:00.892 --> 35:02.686
you know,
because she was beautiful--

35:02.727 --> 35:04.688
-well, maybe a little...
-(laughter)

35:04.729 --> 35:07.315
...um, but it just seemed like,

35:07.357 --> 35:09.442
in the moment,
the right thing to do.

35:09.484 --> 35:13.530
So, what, you just saw
each other and said yes?

35:15.740 --> 35:17.283
BOTH:
Yes.

35:17.325 --> 35:19.077
(both laugh)

35:19.119 --> 35:21.204
And that doesn't seem frivolous?

35:22.497 --> 35:25.333
Historically,
marriage was transactional.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.919
It was about
expanding your empire,

35:27.961 --> 35:30.797
and a woman's value
was based on what she brought.

35:30.839 --> 35:33.675
Like, "You give me a heifer,
and I'll give you my daughter."

35:33.717 --> 35:35.510
(reporters scoffing, murmuring)

35:35.552 --> 35:36.970
CHARLIE:
It's terrible. I know.

35:37.012 --> 35:39.014
That's... Uh, you know,
I didn't come up with it.

35:39.055 --> 35:42.684
But it really was
a business deal,

35:42.726 --> 35:45.103
and it wasn't designed
to be about love,

35:45.145 --> 35:49.149
and maybe that's where people
kind of get tripped up now.

35:49.190 --> 35:51.651
REPORTER: This is your second
marriage, right, Charlie?

35:51.693 --> 35:53.403
You wouldn't want to fail again.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.574
(chuckles softly)

35:57.615 --> 35:59.701
Well, you haven't lived
unless you've failed, Bill.

35:59.743 --> 36:02.037
You should know that
from your time at CNBC.

36:02.078 --> 36:03.496
(laughter)

36:03.538 --> 36:06.624
Listen, what we did was crazy--

36:06.666 --> 36:08.668
we know that-- but, you know,

36:08.710 --> 36:11.671
it was just truly
a leap of faith.

36:11.713 --> 36:15.008
The rules as they exist
pretty much suck for women.

36:15.050 --> 36:17.719
I mean, why do we have to wait
for men to propose?

36:17.761 --> 36:20.305
Why is everything on his terms?

36:20.347 --> 36:22.974
No, I think it is time
to shake things up.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.851
How about this? We pick the guy,

36:24.893 --> 36:28.355
we keep our name and let him
earn the right to stay.

36:28.396 --> 36:31.733
(cheering and applause)

36:34.736 --> 36:36.654
-COLIN: That was terrific.
-(Kat chuckling)

36:36.696 --> 36:38.239
No, no, seriously.
Oh, and listen.

36:38.281 --> 36:39.532
Don't worry about Tuesday.

36:39.574 --> 36:40.867
We'll adjust our schedule
around yours.

36:40.909 --> 36:42.410
-It'll be fine.
-Thanks. I appreciate it.

36:42.452 --> 36:43.745
-No, of course.
-KAT: We'll try not to

36:43.787 --> 36:45.455
turn your life
upside down too much.

36:45.497 --> 36:47.457
I think it might be
a little too late for that.

36:47.499 --> 36:49.209
I mean, do you ever
get used to this?

36:49.250 --> 36:53.880
Just the attention and the chaos
and the people everywhere?

36:53.922 --> 36:55.882
I don't know.
Some days, you barely notice.

36:55.924 --> 36:59.761
Other days, you feel like...
a panda in a zoo.

37:01.137 --> 37:03.223
You should know that up front.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.432
Got it.

37:04.474 --> 37:05.684
Where you off to now?

37:05.725 --> 37:08.228
Oh, London, for a meeting.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.730
And I'm off to Flatbush
for a dog,

37:10.772 --> 37:13.692
which pretty much sums it up.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.945
I'll see you
at the next photo op?

37:16.986 --> 37:19.406
-Okay.
-(engine starts)

37:19.447 --> 37:21.366
Don't forget to check
your schedule.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.243
I got it.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.912
OMG.
He can't even text with that.

37:25.954 --> 37:28.164
OMG. Yes, he can.

37:28.206 --> 37:29.791
(whispers):
But very slowly.

37:39.968 --> 37:41.261
Ay, ay, ay.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.846
PARKER:
You did not look nervous,

37:42.887 --> 37:44.556
and you know what,
you kind of have

37:44.597 --> 37:45.974
offbeat good looks
for someone...

37:46.016 --> 37:47.767
-Offbeat?
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Charlie Valdez!

37:47.809 --> 37:49.269
-Charlie, over here! -CHARLIE:
What are they doing here?

37:49.310 --> 37:50.770
Relax. We're famous now.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.647
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Is this a throuple?

37:52.689 --> 37:54.441
Where's your wife?!
Why don't you live with her?!

37:54.482 --> 37:55.817
Why are you yelling at me?

37:55.859 --> 37:57.444
-I'm standing right here.
-Come on, Charlie.

37:57.485 --> 37:58.778
-I'm gonna go inside.
-What are you doing?

37:58.820 --> 38:00.071
-PARKER: Just, um...
-Are you now Mr. Valdez?

38:00.113 --> 38:01.406
Are you in the doghouse? Huh?

38:01.448 --> 38:03.450
(grunting):
Gonna be a short walk.

38:03.491 --> 38:05.869
Go inside. I'll deal with this.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.579
PHOTOGRAPHER:
You been kicked out already?

38:07.620 --> 38:10.123
The dog can't shit
if people are watching.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.335
Luckily, I can only shit
if people are watching,

38:13.376 --> 38:16.546
so if you're feeling lucky...

38:17.714 --> 38:19.799
I'm busy, too, by the way.

38:19.841 --> 38:22.052
(cheering, excited chatter)

38:24.304 --> 38:26.514
* *

38:27.557 --> 38:29.517
BASTIAN (on video):
What's your name, baby?

38:29.559 --> 38:32.103
-WOMAN (on video): Janice.
-BASTIAN: Janice.

38:32.145 --> 38:34.564
You look so sexy tonight.

38:42.947 --> 38:44.741
KAT:
I don't know about you guys,

38:44.783 --> 38:47.285
but when I get up in
the morning, I like to meditate.

38:47.327 --> 38:48.828
I also love to have fresh juice.

38:48.870 --> 38:50.705
So I like to juice daily
with my Vitamix.

38:50.747 --> 38:52.707
Could we get a Vitamix?

38:52.749 --> 38:54.501
I'd like to juice daily.

38:54.542 --> 38:55.710
Come on. Put that down.

38:55.752 --> 38:57.379
No electronics at dinner.

38:57.420 --> 38:58.880
What do you call that?

38:58.922 --> 39:00.882
I call that
a nature documentary,

39:00.924 --> 39:03.843
so we can travel while we eat.

39:03.885 --> 39:05.845
Put it down.

39:07.222 --> 39:10.350
So, is Kat, like, my stepmom?

39:10.392 --> 39:11.976
No, Lou. Come on.

39:12.018 --> 39:15.021
Dad, I think this experience
is actually really good for you.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.523
Says my 12-year-old?

39:16.564 --> 39:18.316
It's true.
I mean, you never just, like,

39:18.358 --> 39:19.943
do things without planning them.

39:19.984 --> 39:21.319
I think it's cool.

39:21.361 --> 39:22.862
I really want to meet her.

39:22.904 --> 39:24.864
I mean, Parker says she's nice

39:24.906 --> 39:27.742
and smart and next-level hot.

39:27.784 --> 39:29.703
She is nice.
She is... She's an attract...

39:29.744 --> 39:31.287
Here, let me get this.

39:31.329 --> 39:34.249
Dad, she just hit 80 million
followers on Instagram.

39:34.290 --> 39:35.750
Okay. I'm not impressed.

39:35.792 --> 39:38.253
Talk to me when she gets
to 90 million, okay?

39:38.294 --> 39:40.046
Lou, it's not real.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.631
It's all a facade.

39:41.673 --> 39:43.383
You know, they had me
wearing makeup.

39:43.425 --> 39:45.260
You wear makeup now?

39:45.301 --> 39:47.303
Wore once. Never again.

39:47.345 --> 39:50.682
Well, you never say never,
but I don't plan on it

39:50.724 --> 39:53.101
in the next couple months
that we're doing this.

39:53.143 --> 39:55.937
And you're saying the whole time
I can't meet her?

39:55.979 --> 39:57.564
I don't think
Mom would want that.

39:57.605 --> 39:59.399
Actually, Mom wants
to meet her, too.

39:59.441 --> 40:02.861
Oh, perfect. Lou, you know
that we're not really together.

40:02.902 --> 40:05.947
Her manager stages things. Look.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.908
-You have an iPhone?
-Yeah.

40:08.950 --> 40:10.577
I mean, it's-it's just
for scheduling.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.203
They're making me use it.

40:12.245 --> 40:13.705
-Huh.
-Yeah, bowling,

40:13.747 --> 40:15.457
and then we're gonna do
a photo shoot, so...

40:15.498 --> 40:19.419
Uh-huh. But do you guys,
like, talk ever?

40:19.461 --> 40:22.005
It's just publicity.
It's not real.

40:22.047 --> 40:23.965
Hmm.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.926
Yeah! Come on!

40:26.968 --> 40:28.636
Okay, your turn.

40:28.678 --> 40:30.055
Don't be nervous.
It's just, uh...

40:30.096 --> 40:31.765
It's not a competition.
Just having fun.

40:31.806 --> 40:33.350
Uh, okay, no. I'm guessing

40:33.391 --> 40:35.518
from the way you're holding
that that you haven't done

40:35.560 --> 40:37.812
-too much bowling.
-Uh, what do I do?

40:37.854 --> 40:39.773
Well, you... you're gonna want
to put your fingers

40:39.814 --> 40:41.232
-in the holes there.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

40:41.274 --> 40:42.942
This one, yeah.
Get your thumb in that one.

40:42.984 --> 40:44.778
-There? That one? Okay.
-Yep. And then take

40:44.819 --> 40:47.113
three steps kind of--
you want to land on your left,

40:47.155 --> 40:49.199
and don't be afraid
to use those little...

40:53.995 --> 40:56.915
A strike is better
than a spare, right?

40:56.956 --> 40:58.792
-That is not your first time
bowling. -(laughing)

40:58.833 --> 41:00.585
Yes! Did you get that?

41:00.627 --> 41:03.296
-Come on! The old rope-a-dope.
-Yes!

41:03.338 --> 41:05.006
MELISSA:
Oh, my God.

41:05.048 --> 41:07.967
I wish I put money on this,
because people are loving it.

41:08.009 --> 41:09.719
-What people?
-Oh, well, this is

41:09.761 --> 41:12.138
an Instagram live feed,
and 237,000 people

41:12.180 --> 41:14.099
are like, "Why is he
such a boring nerd?"

41:14.140 --> 41:16.351
-Mel.
-What? Their words, not mine.

41:16.393 --> 41:17.477
Get off the live, Mel.

41:17.519 --> 41:18.728
All right.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.021
So, we just need
a little bit more

41:20.063 --> 41:21.523
B roll for The Today Show.

41:21.564 --> 41:24.442
Well, I've-I've got to
get home to Tank.

41:24.484 --> 41:25.902
-Is Tank his daughter?
-Stop.

41:25.944 --> 41:27.612
-COLIN: Okay.
-You have to go?

41:27.654 --> 41:29.781
Yeah, if you guys
are done with me.

41:29.823 --> 41:32.534
Mm-hmm. We're going to a party.

41:32.575 --> 41:34.703
You go.

41:34.744 --> 41:36.746
Where's home?

41:41.835 --> 41:43.837
KAT:
Wow. Cool.

41:43.878 --> 41:46.214
CHARLIE:
Thanks.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.967
Yeah, it's a, um...

41:49.009 --> 41:51.469
Kat, meet dog. (chuckling)

41:51.511 --> 41:53.430
Wow, I never heard
that one before.

41:53.471 --> 41:56.558
Sorry. That was pretty... ruff.

41:56.599 --> 41:59.519
(laughing):
You are so lucky

41:59.561 --> 42:01.354
that Mel didn't
hear you say that.

42:01.396 --> 42:02.856
No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.191
I feel like you're never alone.

42:05.233 --> 42:06.693
What? I'm alone now.

42:06.735 --> 42:09.696
Well, I mean, yeah,
other than Kofi.

42:09.738 --> 42:11.489
KAT:
Just ignore him.

42:11.531 --> 42:14.242
CHARLIE:
Is everything you do filmed?

42:14.284 --> 42:16.244
-KAT: Banked.
-Banked?

42:16.286 --> 42:17.912
For my channel.

42:17.954 --> 42:20.248
Just little mini episodes
of life.

42:22.417 --> 42:25.754
Uh, can-can we skip an episode?

42:28.590 --> 42:29.799
Want me to go?

42:29.841 --> 42:31.551
KAT:
Yeah, you can go.

42:31.593 --> 42:32.844
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Good night.

42:32.886 --> 42:34.512
-I'll see you. Yeah.
-Happy?

42:34.554 --> 42:35.764
Relieved.

42:35.805 --> 42:37.724
(door closes)

42:37.766 --> 42:38.892
KAT:
Is this your daughter?

42:38.933 --> 42:39.893
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-She's cute.

42:39.934 --> 42:42.228
Thanks. Yeah, she's great.

42:42.270 --> 42:45.565
Although she is in that
awkward in-between phase

42:45.607 --> 42:47.901
where she's still my baby girl

42:47.942 --> 42:50.945
but she definitely wants
nothing to do with me.

42:50.987 --> 42:52.947
And you can forget
about getting hugs,

42:52.989 --> 42:55.367
'cause it's not
happening anymore,

42:55.408 --> 43:00.080
which kind of breaks my heart,
but that's the way it goes.

43:00.121 --> 43:02.624
What happened with her mom?

43:03.875 --> 43:05.085
I mean, I'm sorry, you don't...

43:05.126 --> 43:06.336
You know,
it's none of my business.

43:06.378 --> 43:07.837
You don't have to tell me.
(chuckles)

43:07.879 --> 43:10.924
No, no, it's okay. Um...

43:10.965 --> 43:13.677
We were married, and
we actually had a good marriage.

43:13.718 --> 43:15.095
You know, then,

43:15.136 --> 43:16.971
I don't know, all of a sudden,
I got the feeling

43:17.013 --> 43:19.224
she didn't want it
or she didn't want me anymore,

43:19.265 --> 43:21.434
and I had nothing to do
but let her go.

43:21.476 --> 43:24.354
And, you know,
statistically, we're screwed,

43:24.396 --> 43:28.274
'cause 48% of marriages
end in divorce, so...

43:28.316 --> 43:30.443
That means 52% work.

43:30.485 --> 43:32.862
-Ah, an optimist.
-(laughs)

43:33.655 --> 43:35.365
-This is so cool. Can I?
-Yeah.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.743
And then I think when you get
up to, like, second and third,

43:38.785 --> 43:41.037
then it jumps up to, like,
67% failure rate.

43:41.079 --> 43:43.957
Even if it's one in a billion,
what does it matter?

43:43.998 --> 43:46.584
It's worth a shot.

43:46.626 --> 43:48.294
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

43:48.336 --> 43:49.629
I believe in marriage.

43:49.671 --> 43:50.964
Jesus, still?

43:51.006 --> 43:53.258
Haven't you been married
like six times?

43:53.299 --> 43:54.759
Three times.

43:54.801 --> 43:57.178
Not including this.
This is four.

43:57.220 --> 43:59.806
But the first time
was only 48 hours, so...

43:59.848 --> 44:01.349
doesn't count.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.601
But still, do you ever
feel like just kind of,

44:03.643 --> 44:06.688
"I'm waving the white flag
on marriage. That's it."

44:06.730 --> 44:08.481
No, it's like math.

44:08.523 --> 44:12.027
When you get a problem wrong,
you just don't give up on it.

44:13.236 --> 44:15.071
You keep trying
till you get it right.

44:15.113 --> 44:16.906
CHARLIE:
And what about you and Bastian?

44:16.948 --> 44:18.908
How long were you guys together?

44:18.950 --> 44:20.869
Mm, year and a half.

44:20.910 --> 44:23.163
I'd just split
from my second husband.

44:23.204 --> 44:25.290
He was a music producer
who did, uh,

44:25.331 --> 44:28.626
my last two albums
and then sold a sex tape.

44:28.668 --> 44:30.503
-(inhales sharply)
-That's not the worst part.

44:30.545 --> 44:33.423
The worst part is
I thought I could fix things.

44:33.465 --> 44:35.842
-(chuckles)
-Pretty hard to fix a sex tape.

44:35.884 --> 44:37.927
-Right.
-(Tank grumbles)

44:41.181 --> 44:44.309
Sorry. Yeah, it's just
a little power nap.

44:44.351 --> 44:45.852
Pacing himself.

44:45.894 --> 44:47.354
-Mm.
-(Charlie chuckles)

44:47.395 --> 44:50.023
If we give him a minute,
he'll-he'll restart.

44:50.065 --> 44:52.400
-Okay.
-But you were saying?

44:52.442 --> 44:54.069
Well, this business,
those type of guys,

44:54.110 --> 44:55.820
they build you up
to break you down.

44:55.862 --> 44:57.364
But you were
already famous, so...

44:57.405 --> 44:59.199
It's not about fame.

44:59.240 --> 45:02.952
You know,
it's about credibility.

45:02.994 --> 45:05.372
It just didn't matter
how successful I was.

45:05.413 --> 45:08.208
They never gave it to me.

45:08.249 --> 45:11.920
You know I've never been
nominated for anything?

45:12.712 --> 45:15.006
And then I met Bastian.

45:15.048 --> 45:18.426
And he... and he gave me this.

45:20.845 --> 45:23.264
"Sing." What does that mean?

45:23.306 --> 45:26.267
It means "don't let them win."

45:30.647 --> 45:32.399
Nobody's all bad, Charlie.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.401
If they were, it would
make it so much easier.

45:34.442 --> 45:38.488
But cheating on you with
your assistant is pretty bad.

45:42.075 --> 45:44.994
(grunting):
Okay.

45:49.499 --> 45:51.418
Zoo mates.

45:52.794 --> 45:54.921
Zoo mates.

45:56.881 --> 45:59.342
See, we're not
so different, Charlie.

45:59.384 --> 46:00.927
KAT:
* You know I tried so long *

46:00.969 --> 46:02.470
Come on. Come on!
It's not a big...

46:02.512 --> 46:05.432
* Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong *

46:05.473 --> 46:09.144
* I swear I must've spent
a thousand nights *

46:09.185 --> 46:12.939
* Lookin' for somebody
who could hold me tight *

46:12.981 --> 46:15.692
* Until I realized *

46:16.484 --> 46:18.945
* I am the love of,
the love of my life... *

46:18.987 --> 46:21.281
COLIN: The Marciano brothers
and Kat Valdez

46:21.322 --> 46:23.742
are telling the world
there's no age limit.

46:23.783 --> 46:25.785
-Is that right?
-Guess so.

46:25.827 --> 46:27.287
(chuckling)

46:28.329 --> 46:31.082
* I am the love of,
the love of my life *

46:32.292 --> 46:34.127
* I am the love of,
the love of my life *

46:34.169 --> 46:35.879
* I was just
waiting for you... *

46:35.920 --> 46:37.464
Think we've got
everything we need.

46:37.505 --> 46:39.716
We'll post to our socials,
so... you're all set.

46:39.758 --> 46:41.259
(sighs):
All right.

46:41.301 --> 46:44.804
Maybe... Is it okay if I stay?

46:44.846 --> 46:46.389
Oh, yeah.

46:46.431 --> 46:47.766
Yeah, of course.

46:47.807 --> 46:49.684
Make yourself at home.

46:49.726 --> 46:52.896
* I can't tell you now *

46:52.937 --> 46:56.816
* I don't know why,
don't know why *

46:56.858 --> 47:01.154
* And now I'll pick myself up *

47:01.196 --> 47:04.199
* One more time, one more time *

47:04.240 --> 47:06.826
* You know I tried so long *

47:06.868 --> 47:10.663
* Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong... *

47:10.705 --> 47:12.207
-Bye.
-Bye.

47:12.248 --> 47:15.001
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.

47:15.043 --> 47:17.003
How you doing?

47:17.045 --> 47:18.588
* Hold me tight *

47:18.630 --> 47:21.341
* Until I realized *

47:22.217 --> 47:24.427
* I am the love of,
the love of my life... *

47:24.469 --> 47:27.639
There's a picture of you
buying her a pregnancy test.

47:27.681 --> 47:29.099
-Charlie!
-No.

47:29.140 --> 47:31.434
No, that was
a stool softener for Tank.

47:31.476 --> 47:33.687
* I ain't got nobody else
on my mind... *

47:33.728 --> 47:36.981
REPORTER: Kat Valdez and her
new husband, Charlie Gilbert.

47:37.023 --> 47:39.192
-Wh-What do I do?
-Just stand and smile.

47:39.234 --> 47:40.652
-Charlie! Charlie!
-(clamoring)

47:40.694 --> 47:43.405
-Oh, my God, it's Bastian!
-Bastian! -Bastian!

47:43.446 --> 47:45.990
Bastian, Bastian, Bastian!
Over here! Over here!

47:46.032 --> 47:47.492
(clamoring continues)

47:47.534 --> 47:49.327
Guys, this way. How about
the three of you together?

47:49.369 --> 47:51.287
No hard feelings, man. Yeah?

47:51.329 --> 47:53.581
No feelings at all. (chuckles)

47:54.582 --> 47:55.875
Mm, mamacita.

47:55.917 --> 47:57.168
PHOTOGRAPHER: Bastian,
one with the three of you.

48:03.425 --> 48:05.301
PHOTOGRAPHER:
What did he say to you?

48:05.343 --> 48:06.720
Kat, Bastian, Charlie, this way!

48:06.761 --> 48:08.888
-What did he say, Charlie?
-Look, Bastian! Bastian!

48:08.930 --> 48:11.099
-Thank you, guys.
-(clamoring continues)

48:11.141 --> 48:13.643
My Spanish is a little rusty,
but he said,

48:13.685 --> 48:15.895
"You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

48:15.937 --> 48:17.564
"I'm such an idiot.

48:17.605 --> 48:20.108
And why did I get
that neck tattoo?"

48:21.401 --> 48:23.486
You okay?

48:24.904 --> 48:26.656
I'm good.

48:26.698 --> 48:28.950
(jet engine whooshing)

48:29.909 --> 48:31.286
CHARLIE:
Now, where are you?

48:31.327 --> 48:33.580
KAT:
Paris, for a show.

48:33.621 --> 48:34.789
CHARLIE:
Ah.

48:34.831 --> 48:36.416
-Paris!
-CHARLIE: Is it weird having

48:36.458 --> 48:38.251
everyone in the world
know who you are?

48:38.293 --> 48:39.919
KAT:
No, what's weird is that

48:39.961 --> 48:42.047
everyone in the world thinks
they know who I am.

48:42.088 --> 48:43.923
CHARLIE:
Yeah, I bet.

48:43.965 --> 48:45.884
And you're headed home
after that?

48:45.925 --> 48:47.427
KAT:
Well, um, I'm home tomorrow,

48:47.469 --> 48:49.554
but then I have
that private in Japan.

48:49.596 --> 48:51.097
Wh-What's a private?

48:51.139 --> 48:53.600
KAT: I get paid a fortune
to sing songs

48:53.641 --> 48:56.061
to like ten
insanely rich people.

48:56.102 --> 48:57.562
CHARLIE:
Do you think maybe they'd want

48:57.604 --> 48:59.481
to watch someone do
some math problems?

48:59.522 --> 49:01.232
-(class cheering)
-(Kat chuckling)

49:01.274 --> 49:02.776
-KAT: I'll ask.
-CHARLIE: All right, well,

49:02.817 --> 49:06.196
I'll let you go,
but call me if you're lonely.

49:06.237 --> 49:08.615
(ringtone playing)

49:08.656 --> 49:10.158
Hello?

49:10.200 --> 49:12.952
-KAT: I'm lonely.
-(laughing)

49:12.994 --> 49:15.914
It's been like 13 seconds.

49:15.955 --> 49:18.166
Are you brushing your teeth?

49:18.208 --> 49:20.210
-Yes.
-Are you going to bed?

49:20.251 --> 49:22.962
It-it's like 8:00 p.m. there.

49:23.004 --> 49:25.465
Um, maybe.

49:25.507 --> 49:27.133
-Wow.
-Well, I'm gonna read.

49:27.175 --> 49:29.469
I'm not gonna go right to bed.

49:29.511 --> 49:31.179
How's Lou?

49:31.221 --> 49:32.555
She's really good.

49:32.597 --> 49:34.641
She finally agreed
to join the math club,

49:34.683 --> 49:37.477
which makes me happy
'cause she's phenomenal at math

49:37.519 --> 49:39.187
even though
she doesn't want to be.

49:39.229 --> 49:41.106
Well, maybe she just
doesn't want to be you.

49:41.147 --> 49:42.273
That's for certain.

49:42.315 --> 49:43.650
But it's not really that.

49:43.692 --> 49:45.819
It's-it's more that
she's afraid, and,

49:45.860 --> 49:48.405
you know, she almost won
the Mathalon when she was 11.

49:48.446 --> 49:50.615
-The Mathalon?
-Yeah, the Mathalon.

49:50.657 --> 49:52.450
It's kind of like
the Grammys for math,

49:52.492 --> 49:54.619
except there's like
four people in the audience.

49:54.661 --> 49:57.622
-Ah. -She kind of froze
in the finals,

49:57.664 --> 50:01.084
and then some kids
made fun of her and...

50:01.126 --> 50:02.919
I just want her
to find her place.

50:02.961 --> 50:05.171
Just give her a minute.

50:05.213 --> 50:07.173
Yeah, definitely.

50:07.215 --> 50:09.884
Okay, well, I'm glad
you were lonely.

50:09.926 --> 50:11.553
(chuckling)

50:11.594 --> 50:13.930
I guess I'll let you
get to bed now.

50:13.972 --> 50:15.932
-(laughs) Okay.
-Bye.

50:15.974 --> 50:17.684
So long. Adios.

50:17.726 --> 50:19.561
(laughs) Bye.

50:19.602 --> 50:20.812
See you.

50:28.028 --> 50:29.988
(sighs):
Yeah.

50:30.030 --> 50:31.990
(kids chattering)

50:32.032 --> 50:33.950
(school bell rings)

50:33.992 --> 50:36.369
Okay, after you've completed
the prime factorization,

50:36.411 --> 50:38.621
identify the distinct
prime factor.

50:38.663 --> 50:40.707
All right, listen up,
Coolidge Pi-thons.

50:40.749 --> 50:42.459
-I'm here on official business.
-Park...

50:42.500 --> 50:45.295
First of all, who didn't get
their waiver signed?

50:45.337 --> 50:46.713
All right, you two, out.

50:46.755 --> 50:48.590
Hey, y-you can't just
dismiss my students.

50:48.631 --> 50:50.383
(mock stammering) Yes, I can.

50:50.425 --> 50:53.094
You heard me. Scram. Beat it!

50:53.928 --> 50:55.597
Now, for the rest of you

50:55.638 --> 50:57.932
who know how
to follow direction,

50:57.974 --> 51:01.644
I bring you the one, the only...

51:02.437 --> 51:03.980
(students gasping)

51:04.022 --> 51:06.232
(squealing excitedly)

51:06.274 --> 51:07.567
Kat, I love you!

51:07.609 --> 51:09.903
Percy, stop yelling.
She's right here.

51:09.944 --> 51:11.363
Hi.

51:11.404 --> 51:13.740
Thought you had a private
for, like, a fortune.

51:13.782 --> 51:15.617
I rescheduled.

51:15.658 --> 51:18.078
PARKER: All right,
who's got a question for Kat?

51:18.119 --> 51:19.287
-Oh, I do! I do!
-Me! Me!

51:19.329 --> 51:20.747
Say something smart.

51:20.789 --> 51:21.998
Don't embarrass me.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.083
Uh, George.

51:23.124 --> 51:24.751
Did you really kiss Katy Perry?

51:24.793 --> 51:25.960
Actually, she kissed me.

51:26.002 --> 51:27.545
-STUDENTS: Ooh.
-KAT: Next.

51:27.587 --> 51:28.338
Oh!

51:28.380 --> 51:29.506
Uh, Not George.

51:29.547 --> 51:30.840
-Spencer.
-Don't care.

51:30.882 --> 51:34.552
Why is Mr. Gilbert
better than Bastian?

51:34.594 --> 51:36.846
Well...

51:36.888 --> 51:39.265
he didn't cheat on me
with my assistant.

51:39.307 --> 51:41.601
-STUDENTS: Ooh.
-(laughter, cheering)

51:41.643 --> 51:43.978
Okay, you guys caught us
right in the middle

51:44.020 --> 51:46.106
of our mock Mathalon training,

51:46.147 --> 51:49.109
which you're welcome to stay
and enjoy for a little bit.

51:49.150 --> 51:51.403
Uh, Lou, you're up.

51:51.444 --> 51:53.196
-(whispers): Dad, no.
-KAT: Is that Lou?

51:53.238 --> 51:54.823
Yeah.

51:54.864 --> 51:56.991
Finally. Hi.

51:57.033 --> 51:58.993
I've wanted to meet you forever.

51:59.035 --> 52:00.412
Me, too.

52:00.453 --> 52:02.122
PARKER: Are you kidding me?
They haven't met?

52:02.163 --> 52:03.957
-No.
-What is wrong with you?

52:03.998 --> 52:06.501
-Well, they...
-(whispers): You're married.

52:06.543 --> 52:08.128
Can we forget about
the mock Mathalon?

52:08.169 --> 52:10.296
I have a million questions
for Kat.

52:10.338 --> 52:11.589
Yeah, and Lou's too scared
to get up

52:11.631 --> 52:12.799
in front of people anyways.

52:12.841 --> 52:14.217
Shut up, Jose.

52:14.259 --> 52:15.969
Oh, well, don't worry.
I totally get it.

52:16.011 --> 52:18.471
You know, sometimes when I have
to get up in front of an arena

52:18.513 --> 52:22.100
with thousands and thousands
of people, I get so nervous.

52:22.142 --> 52:23.685
(student murmuring in disbelief)

52:23.727 --> 52:25.687
No, I'm serious.
I'm afraid I'll choke.

52:25.729 --> 52:29.107
Okay, Mel, pull up
"Kat VMAs 2010."

52:29.149 --> 52:30.316
-I've got it.
-Oh, okay.

52:30.358 --> 52:31.860
-Hey, Google.
-Look at this.

52:31.901 --> 52:37.032
Show me a video: "Kat Valdez
2010 VMA performance."

52:37.073 --> 52:40.660
* Number nine, yeah,
I'm going up *

52:40.702 --> 52:42.704
* I'm getting so high *

52:43.538 --> 52:45.373
* I'm not the sa... *

52:45.415 --> 52:46.750
KAT:
Hey, Google.

52:46.791 --> 52:48.168
-(laughs): That's enough.
-(music stops)

52:48.209 --> 52:50.378
-(students groaning)
-Yeah.

52:51.254 --> 52:54.049
I forgot the lyrics on live TV

52:54.090 --> 52:56.134
to a song that I wrote.

52:56.176 --> 52:57.927
It could happen to anybody.

52:57.969 --> 53:00.263
Yeah, but the point is
that once it does,

53:00.305 --> 53:02.599
you're always worried, you know?

53:02.640 --> 53:04.392
What if it happens again?

53:04.434 --> 53:05.727
What did you do?

53:05.769 --> 53:07.520
I shifted focus.

53:07.562 --> 53:09.522
I made my dance so hard

53:09.564 --> 53:12.275
that all I could do
was concentrate on the steps.

53:12.317 --> 53:15.028
So, it's like
you distracted your mind.

53:15.070 --> 53:16.863
Yes. Exactly.

53:16.905 --> 53:21.284
Concentrating on the dance steps
made me forget how scared I was.

53:24.537 --> 53:26.956
Mel, we're gonna need
some speakers.

53:29.042 --> 53:31.044
Not too loud, right?

53:31.086 --> 53:33.296
(blasting over speakers):
* I just got paid... *

53:33.338 --> 53:34.381
STUDENTS:
Hey!

53:34.422 --> 53:35.924
KAT:
And two.

53:35.965 --> 53:38.218
And free your mind,
and three and four.

53:38.259 --> 53:40.220
Make a turn, three and four.

53:40.261 --> 53:42.013
Again, three and four.

53:42.055 --> 53:43.515
* Don't know
where we're going... *

53:43.556 --> 53:45.475
And one and two,
and three and four.

53:45.517 --> 53:48.520
And ask a question,
three and four.

53:49.521 --> 53:52.065
Look alive, Chuck,
three and four.

53:52.107 --> 53:53.692
Oh, uh, okay.

53:53.733 --> 53:56.403
Lou, what is 43 times 101?

53:56.444 --> 53:58.488
-4-3-4-3.
-Yes!

53:58.530 --> 53:59.906
Yes, you're on fire. Yes!

53:59.948 --> 54:01.741
You're ruining it, Charlie,
three and four.

54:01.783 --> 54:03.868
Keep the time,
and three and four.

54:03.910 --> 54:04.994
And turn.

54:05.036 --> 54:07.831
CHARLIE:
Esther, what is five factorial?

54:07.872 --> 54:09.332
Uh, 120.

54:09.374 --> 54:10.417
Yeah!

54:10.458 --> 54:13.003
All geniuses with rhythm.

54:13.044 --> 54:15.088
(cheering)

54:15.130 --> 54:16.339
* I just got paid... *

54:16.381 --> 54:17.716
(chanting):
Go, Percy. Go, Percy.

54:17.757 --> 54:18.883
Go, Percy.

54:18.925 --> 54:22.595
Go, Tristen.
Go, Tristen. Go, Tristen.

54:22.637 --> 54:27.308
Go, Jose. Go, Jose.
Go, Jose. Go, Jose.

54:27.350 --> 54:29.602
(cheering)

54:29.644 --> 54:32.856
Go, Leah. Go, Leah. Go, Leah.

54:32.897 --> 54:37.068
Go, Kat. Go, Kat.
Go, Kat. Go, Kat.

54:37.110 --> 54:38.403
(cheering)

54:38.445 --> 54:40.113
* I just got paid *

54:40.155 --> 54:42.115
* Give me that, give me that,
give me that*

54:42.157 --> 54:44.159
* Give me that,
give me that, give me that*

54:44.200 --> 54:46.453
* Give me that money,
give me that money*

54:46.494 --> 54:48.371
-* Give me that money*
-* I just got paid *

54:48.413 --> 54:50.290
* Give me that, give me that,
give me that*

54:50.331 --> 54:52.417
* Give me that,
give me that, give me that*

54:52.459 --> 54:54.127
* Give me that money,
give me that money*

54:54.169 --> 54:55.295
-* Give me that money*
-(cheering)

54:55.337 --> 54:57.380
* I just got paid. *

54:57.422 --> 54:59.591
(piano plays simple melody)

55:09.684 --> 55:11.436
What are the words?

55:11.478 --> 55:15.690
Uh, I haven't figured
that out yet.

55:15.732 --> 55:19.110
And, actually, the more I try,
the harder it gets.

55:19.152 --> 55:20.612
(sighs)

55:20.653 --> 55:24.824
You know, when I can't
figure out homework stuff,

55:24.866 --> 55:27.619
my dad says,
"If you sit in the question,

55:27.660 --> 55:29.454
the answer finds you."

55:29.496 --> 55:30.872
Hmm.

55:30.914 --> 55:32.082
And does it?

55:32.123 --> 55:34.042
I don't know. I...

55:34.084 --> 55:35.627
I don't sit long enough.

55:35.669 --> 55:37.587
(laughs):
Yeah.

55:37.629 --> 55:39.714
That's my problem, too.

55:43.802 --> 55:47.389
So, do you like my dad?

55:47.430 --> 55:50.225
I mean, he can be so annoying,

55:50.266 --> 55:53.812
but he's also, like,
really smart and nice.

55:53.853 --> 55:57.357
You know, your dad says
you're the best thing about him.

55:57.399 --> 55:59.025
That's probably true.

55:59.067 --> 56:00.443
(laughs)

56:00.485 --> 56:02.320
MAN:
Let's put it right over here.

56:02.362 --> 56:03.697
LOU:
Whoa.

56:03.738 --> 56:06.324
-Is all this stuff for you?
-CHARLIE: Coach.

56:06.366 --> 56:08.076
Is this another
endorsement deal?

56:08.118 --> 56:09.703
No.

56:09.744 --> 56:11.913
They're donating merchandise
to Dress for Success,

56:11.955 --> 56:14.499
which is a charity
that I work with.

56:14.541 --> 56:16.918
-That's awesome.
-(chuckles)

56:16.960 --> 56:18.378
You like?

56:18.420 --> 56:20.296
I love.

56:20.338 --> 56:22.424
(Charlie chuckling)

56:24.092 --> 56:25.885
-No way.
-Yeah.

56:25.927 --> 56:27.387
Can I?

56:27.429 --> 56:29.389
KAT:
Don't worry. I'll pay them back.

56:29.431 --> 56:30.724
(shushes quietly)

56:30.765 --> 56:32.225
-CHARLIE: Okay, come on.
-Thank you.

56:32.267 --> 56:34.769
You got another bag in here
with some textbooks.

56:36.688 --> 56:38.815
-Thank you.
-Are you kidding?

56:38.857 --> 56:41.526
-(Charlie chuckles)
-I love it. (laughs)

56:41.568 --> 56:43.987
-I got to get her home.
-What?

56:44.029 --> 56:46.531
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Already? No.

56:47.323 --> 56:48.950
Okay.

56:49.701 --> 56:51.119
I love Keats.

56:56.458 --> 56:57.959
-Oh. (sucks teeth)
-Wha...

56:58.001 --> 56:59.919
(laughing):
Stop. What are you doing?

56:59.961 --> 57:02.255
-I killed it.
-(laughing): It's not...

57:02.297 --> 57:04.049
Listen, I'm gonna say something

57:04.090 --> 57:07.302
-that's probably gonna come out
completely wrong... -(chuckles)

57:07.344 --> 57:10.597
...but you're beautiful
without all of that.

57:10.638 --> 57:12.974
-Aw.
-I mean, either way, you're...

57:13.016 --> 57:14.976
good to go.

57:15.018 --> 57:18.772
-Good to go?
-Good to go.

57:18.813 --> 57:21.191
-(laughs) Okay, I'll take it.
-(laughs)

57:23.985 --> 57:26.154
You're a great teacher, Charlie.

57:27.238 --> 57:30.617
Those kids,
they're lucky to have you.

57:30.658 --> 57:32.660
I don't know,
hanging with you guys today

57:32.702 --> 57:35.455
made me feel kind of normal.

57:35.497 --> 57:37.665
Wheels up for Puerto Rico
at 7:00.

57:38.667 --> 57:40.460
Oh, my bad.

57:40.502 --> 57:42.712
I thought you were by yourself.

57:46.091 --> 57:48.259
Puerto Rico.

57:50.095 --> 57:54.891
Um, my friends, they have
a bed-and-breakfast there, so...

57:54.933 --> 57:56.935
That's...

57:58.144 --> 58:01.314
Listen, if-if...
if Bastian is the guy

58:01.356 --> 58:03.650
that you think
you're supposed to be with,

58:03.692 --> 58:07.779
then, hell, I'll drive you
to the airport.

58:07.821 --> 58:10.073
But if you're not sure...

58:11.366 --> 58:13.034
...then come with me

58:13.076 --> 58:15.537
to the fall semiformal
tomorrow night.

58:16.871 --> 58:18.915
Yeah, they need chaperones.

58:18.957 --> 58:21.001
Maybe you need chaperoning.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.670
Listen, I'm not saying this

58:23.712 --> 58:25.171
as your husband
or even as your friend,

58:25.213 --> 58:27.007
because technically
I'm not either,

58:27.048 --> 58:30.552
but if you go back to Bastian,
aren't you just making

58:30.593 --> 58:34.014
the same mistake
all over again... again?

58:34.055 --> 58:36.057
* *

58:43.314 --> 58:46.151
Are you asking me
to the school dance?

58:47.152 --> 58:50.113
-Well, I could leave a note in
your locker, but... -(laughing)

58:50.155 --> 58:54.784
...here we are in free period,
so I figured I'd take my shot.

58:55.785 --> 58:57.495
(chuckles softly)

58:57.537 --> 59:00.582
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

59:05.045 --> 59:07.881
CHARLIE:
Welcome. (chuckles)

59:07.922 --> 59:10.258
Excuse me. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.344
Come on. Okay.

59:12.385 --> 59:13.595
Can I have your left wrist?

59:13.636 --> 59:15.305
My left wr-- Okay.

59:18.808 --> 59:20.769
Oh, my God.

59:20.810 --> 59:22.228
How sweet.

59:22.270 --> 59:25.231
Oh, and I also got you this
to give me.

59:25.273 --> 59:27.400
(both laughing)

59:27.442 --> 59:28.860
So thank you very much.

59:28.902 --> 59:30.653
-I'm glad I thought of that.
-It's my favorite.

59:33.615 --> 59:36.201
You look in...

59:36.242 --> 59:37.744
You look... (sighs)

59:37.786 --> 59:39.746
Let's go to the dance.

59:39.788 --> 59:42.624
PARKER:
Out of respect for Mr. and Mrs.

59:42.665 --> 59:44.417
Gilbert-hyphen-Valdez,

59:44.459 --> 59:47.212
we would like the gym
to be a photo-free zone,

59:47.253 --> 59:49.756
so please check
your phones at the door.

59:49.798 --> 59:51.675
(upbeat dance music playing)

59:52.926 --> 59:54.594
You did all this for me?

59:54.636 --> 59:57.222
-I might've had a little help.
-(laughs)

59:58.431 --> 1:00:00.517
You know what, Kofi, why don't
you take the night off?

1:00:00.558 --> 1:00:01.810
I'll let you know
when I need you.

1:00:01.851 --> 1:00:03.353
All right.
Have a good time, y'all.

1:00:03.395 --> 1:00:05.355
Okay. All right.

1:00:05.397 --> 1:00:06.856
Unsupervised.

1:00:06.898 --> 1:00:08.775
I'm gonna screen-grab
your search history

1:00:08.817 --> 1:00:10.318
and send it to your mother.

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.736
That's a guarantee.

1:00:11.778 --> 1:00:14.823
("Satisfied" by Galantis
featuring MAX playing)

1:00:14.864 --> 1:00:16.491
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:00:16.533 --> 1:00:18.159
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

1:00:18.201 --> 1:00:19.744
* *

1:00:19.786 --> 1:00:21.913
-Kill the music!
-(music stops)

1:00:21.955 --> 1:00:24.332
A-one, two, three, four.

1:00:24.374 --> 1:00:25.542
Hit it.

1:00:25.583 --> 1:00:28.253
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

1:00:28.294 --> 1:00:30.547
* Marry me, marry me,
say yes... *

1:00:30.588 --> 1:00:31.840
What are you doing?

1:00:31.881 --> 1:00:33.633
You know, kids opening
for pop stars

1:00:33.675 --> 1:00:35.093
is very big these days.

1:00:35.135 --> 1:00:36.386
* I've never seen forever... *

1:00:36.428 --> 1:00:38.972
When did the glee club
learn "Marry Me"?

1:00:39.014 --> 1:00:41.307
When Charlie Gilbert
became Charlie Valdez.

1:00:41.349 --> 1:00:43.685
-I'm hungry, Mr. Pitts.
-Keep singing!

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:45.020
You're an inspiration, Pitts.

1:00:45.061 --> 1:00:46.396
Right back at you, Gilbert.

1:00:46.438 --> 1:00:48.398
Oh, my God,
they are so adorable.

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:49.566
-Uh...
-Thank you.

1:00:49.607 --> 1:00:51.234
If you could.

1:00:52.485 --> 1:00:54.946
Um, yeah, okay. (laughs)

1:00:54.988 --> 1:00:57.824
PITTS:
"To Jonathan Gregory Pitts,

1:00:57.866 --> 1:01:00.577
a fellow architect of song."

1:01:00.618 --> 1:01:03.496
(laughs) Okay, let her breathe
just a little bit.

1:01:03.538 --> 1:01:05.040
Come on.

1:01:05.081 --> 1:01:06.875
-* Ring, ring, ring *
-* Ring, ring *

1:01:06.916 --> 1:01:07.834
-* Church bells, let 'em ring,
ring, ring... * -(chuckles)

1:01:07.876 --> 1:01:08.960
Love and light.

1:01:09.002 --> 1:01:10.503
-Love and light.
-Okay. Cut!

1:01:10.545 --> 1:01:12.213
-* Tonight, tonight. *
-Bring the music back!

1:01:12.255 --> 1:01:15.342
(over speakers):
* Keep me satisfied... *

1:01:15.383 --> 1:01:16.509
(excited chatter)

1:01:16.551 --> 1:01:17.844
(both chuckling)

1:01:17.886 --> 1:01:20.847
So, do we have a job?

1:01:20.889 --> 1:01:22.599
Do we have duties?
What do we do?

1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:24.351
Yes, we do. We got to monitor.

1:01:24.392 --> 1:01:26.728
We got to guide.
We got to encourage.

1:01:26.770 --> 1:01:28.521
-Okay.
-We might have to discourage.

1:01:28.563 --> 1:01:31.149
-(laughing)
-We might have to separate.

1:01:31.191 --> 1:01:34.027
And maybe later... mm, dance?

1:01:34.069 --> 1:01:36.029
(laughing): I don't think
you want to see that.

1:01:36.071 --> 1:01:38.490
Oh, I do. I do want to see that.

1:01:38.531 --> 1:01:40.325
Did you see my corsage?

1:01:40.367 --> 1:01:42.535
I did.

1:01:42.577 --> 1:01:45.372
(indistinct chatter)

1:01:45.413 --> 1:01:48.291
* *

1:01:48.333 --> 1:01:49.918
Hey!

1:01:49.959 --> 1:01:51.795
-(camera clicks)
-(yells playfully)

1:01:51.836 --> 1:01:53.088
(laughing)

1:01:53.129 --> 1:01:54.631
Oh, yeah, I want to do one.

1:01:54.673 --> 1:01:55.715
-Ready?
-Yep.

1:01:55.757 --> 1:01:57.008
Okay.

1:02:02.472 --> 1:02:03.682
Hold this.

1:02:03.723 --> 1:02:05.642
What are you doing?

1:02:05.684 --> 1:02:06.976
A private.

1:02:07.018 --> 1:02:09.270
(upbeat dance music playing)

1:02:11.064 --> 1:02:12.816
(feedback squeals)

1:02:12.857 --> 1:02:14.317
Hey, everybody.

1:02:14.359 --> 1:02:16.236
-(music stops)
-(excited chatter)

1:02:16.277 --> 1:02:18.405
This is my first semiformal,

1:02:18.446 --> 1:02:20.323
and, uh,

1:02:20.365 --> 1:02:22.826
I just want to thank you guys
for letting me crash.

1:02:22.867 --> 1:02:24.244
We love you, Kat!

1:02:24.285 --> 1:02:25.995
(chuckles) Thank you, Parker.

1:02:26.037 --> 1:02:27.914
Love you, too.

1:02:27.956 --> 1:02:30.208
Uh, you guys mind
if I do a song?

1:02:30.250 --> 1:02:33.253
-(cheering)
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:02:33.294 --> 1:02:36.089
I actually wrote this song
when I was about your age.

1:02:36.131 --> 1:02:37.966
It was on my very first album.

1:02:38.008 --> 1:02:39.634
It's called "After Love."

1:02:39.676 --> 1:02:40.927
You guys may not know it.

1:02:40.969 --> 1:02:43.096
-I do!
-KAT: Oh. Do you want to come

1:02:43.138 --> 1:02:46.016
-up here and do it with me?
-(Parker gasps)

1:02:46.057 --> 1:02:47.934
-You play?
-Y-Yeah.

1:02:47.976 --> 1:02:49.436
Let's do it.

1:02:49.477 --> 1:02:51.813
(cheering)

1:02:51.855 --> 1:02:53.606
(chuckles)

1:02:53.648 --> 1:02:57.736
Give it up for a fellow
architect of song, Mr. Pitts.

1:02:57.777 --> 1:02:59.612
(cheering)

1:02:59.654 --> 1:03:01.865
-Pitts!
-Mr. Pitts!

1:03:03.908 --> 1:03:05.201
Ready?

1:03:06.077 --> 1:03:07.495
Three, four.

1:03:07.537 --> 1:03:08.830
-* Long nights in your car *
-(guitar playing)

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:11.124
* Mornings in your arms *

1:03:11.166 --> 1:03:13.168
* From five-hour calls *

1:03:13.209 --> 1:03:15.378
* To nothing at all *

1:03:15.420 --> 1:03:17.756
* I guess I missed the signs *

1:03:17.797 --> 1:03:20.091
* The writing on the wall, ooh *

1:03:20.133 --> 1:03:22.969
* Don't know where
it all went wrong *

1:03:23.011 --> 1:03:27.849
* But if this is how
it's got to be *

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:32.854
* I need someone to tell me,
tell me, tell me, tell me *

1:03:32.896 --> 1:03:35.315
* What comes after love? *

1:03:35.357 --> 1:03:39.486
* I want to know there's
something for me after us *

1:03:39.527 --> 1:03:43.656
* I don't think my heart
was made to break this much *

1:03:43.698 --> 1:03:48.036
* Tell me there's
a happy ever after love *

1:03:48.078 --> 1:03:53.083
* Tell me there's a happy
ever after us *

1:03:54.292 --> 1:03:56.836
-* I believe, I believe *
-(attendees singing along)

1:03:56.878 --> 1:03:58.630
* I believe in love *

1:03:58.672 --> 1:04:02.717
* Even if, even if
it wasn't meant for us *

1:04:02.759 --> 1:04:07.347
* I believe, I believe,
I believe in love *

1:04:07.389 --> 1:04:09.224
* I just need someone
to tell me *

1:04:09.265 --> 1:04:10.934
* Tell me, tell me, tell me *

1:04:10.975 --> 1:04:13.561
* What comes after love? *

1:04:13.603 --> 1:04:17.899
* I want to know there's
something for me after us *

1:04:17.941 --> 1:04:22.153
* I don't think my heart
was made to break this much *

1:04:22.195 --> 1:04:26.449
* Tell me there's
a happy ever after love *

1:04:26.491 --> 1:04:31.079
* Tell me there's a happy
ever after us. *

1:04:31.121 --> 1:04:33.373
-(song ends)
-(cheering)

1:04:42.590 --> 1:04:45.969
-Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. -Thank you.

1:04:46.011 --> 1:04:48.680
KAT:
Thank you guys so much!

1:04:48.722 --> 1:04:51.683
Well, that is
my new favorite song.

1:04:51.725 --> 1:04:53.685
(Kat chuckles)

1:04:53.727 --> 1:04:56.730
What was your old favorite song?

1:04:56.771 --> 1:04:58.356
Um... I don't know,

1:04:58.398 --> 1:05:01.943
this might be a little
too edgy for you to handle,

1:05:01.985 --> 1:05:05.030
but when my mom was sick,
we watched a lot of musicals,

1:05:05.071 --> 1:05:07.032
and her favorite was Camelot.

1:05:07.073 --> 1:05:08.366
KAT:
Mm.

1:05:08.408 --> 1:05:09.909
You know, it was like
Game of Thrones

1:05:09.951 --> 1:05:11.995
but less nudity and murder.

1:05:12.037 --> 1:05:15.707
-More music and velvet.
-(laughs)

1:05:15.749 --> 1:05:17.250
But, anyway, when Lancelot

1:05:17.292 --> 1:05:19.252
wants to tell Guenevere
how he feels,

1:05:19.294 --> 1:05:21.755
instead of saying,
"I want to be with you,"

1:05:21.796 --> 1:05:25.342
he says, "We're gonna split up.
It's inevitable."

1:05:25.383 --> 1:05:27.177
That's a little depressing.

1:05:27.218 --> 1:05:29.012
No, not when you hear it.

1:05:29.054 --> 1:05:32.849
"If ever I were to leave you,
it wouldn't be in summer."

1:05:32.891 --> 1:05:38.063
* If ever I would leave you *

1:05:38.104 --> 1:05:41.566
* It wouldn't be in summer *

1:05:41.608 --> 1:05:45.445
* Seeing you in summer,
I never would go *

1:05:45.487 --> 1:05:47.572
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

1:05:48.656 --> 1:05:52.869
* Your hair streaked
with sunlight *

1:05:52.911 --> 1:05:54.621
* Your lips red as flame... *

1:05:54.662 --> 1:05:57.207
-Dance with me.
-(laughs): No, I don't dance.

1:05:57.248 --> 1:05:59.626
Come on. Dance with me.

1:06:01.795 --> 1:06:03.546
Just a little bit.

1:06:05.715 --> 1:06:08.301
There we go.

1:06:08.343 --> 1:06:12.305
* How could it be in autumn? *

1:06:12.347 --> 1:06:14.432
* How I'd leave in autumn *

1:06:14.474 --> 1:06:18.812
* I never would know... *

1:06:18.853 --> 1:06:21.981
Shouldn't we be listening
to Barry White or Drake...

1:06:22.023 --> 1:06:24.484
-(laughing) -...or whatever
it is you listen to

1:06:24.526 --> 1:06:26.486
when you're about to,
you know...

1:06:26.528 --> 1:06:28.405
To what?

1:06:29.197 --> 1:06:31.282
Well...

1:06:32.075 --> 1:06:33.535
Well, I don't want to presume

1:06:33.576 --> 1:06:36.246
that I'm about to have
the best night of my life,

1:06:36.287 --> 1:06:40.583
but if I am, I don't want
to do it to Robert Goulet.

1:06:42.210 --> 1:06:44.045
I like it.

1:06:44.087 --> 1:06:45.296
You do?

1:06:45.338 --> 1:06:47.882
* When you catch
the fire's glow *

1:06:47.924 --> 1:06:49.718
A lot.

1:06:50.927 --> 1:06:55.515
* If ever I would leave you *

1:06:55.557 --> 1:06:59.519
* How could it be
in springtime *

1:06:59.561 --> 1:07:01.521
* Knowing how in spring *

1:07:01.563 --> 1:07:06.985
* I'm bewitched by you so? *

1:07:07.027 --> 1:07:10.989
* Oh, no, not in springtime... *

1:07:11.031 --> 1:07:13.575
Is this smart?

1:07:14.576 --> 1:07:17.996
I think we left smart
six weeks ago.

1:07:18.038 --> 1:07:20.248
* *

1:07:35.930 --> 1:07:38.183
* *

1:07:43.688 --> 1:07:45.732
(birds chirping)

1:07:48.109 --> 1:07:50.362
(sighs)

1:07:56.785 --> 1:07:57.911
(Charlie sighs)

1:07:57.952 --> 1:08:01.247
-Morning.
-Morning.

1:08:02.832 --> 1:08:05.251
Thank God you're here.

1:08:05.293 --> 1:08:08.797
'Cause I did have
just a minute of:

1:08:08.838 --> 1:08:11.800
-"Is she gone? Did she leave?"
-(laughs)

1:08:11.841 --> 1:08:14.511
I was like, "God, just...

1:08:14.552 --> 1:08:17.097
"I know you rock stars
move fast,

1:08:17.138 --> 1:08:19.849
-on to the next town,
like, just love..." -(laughs)

1:08:19.891 --> 1:08:22.936
-Oh, God. Here, take it.
-(cell phone ringing)

1:08:22.977 --> 1:08:24.104
Hey.

1:08:24.145 --> 1:08:25.522
MELISSA:
Hey, how was last night?

1:08:25.563 --> 1:08:28.191
-KAT: Amazing.
-MELISSA: Wait. Where are you?

1:08:28.233 --> 1:08:30.443
-Are you with, uh...
-Yeah. Charlie.

1:08:30.485 --> 1:08:32.779
-Still?
-Still.

1:08:32.821 --> 1:08:34.948
(Melissa continues indistinctly
over phone)

1:08:34.989 --> 1:08:36.449
(whispers):
"Charlie. Still."

1:08:36.491 --> 1:08:38.576
KAT: Let's just move that
to Tuesday.

1:08:38.618 --> 1:08:39.953
MELISSA:
But they're expecting you.

1:08:39.994 --> 1:08:42.122
Sorry. Just tell 'em no.

1:08:42.163 --> 1:08:43.832
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:08:43.873 --> 1:08:45.542
I'll call you later.

1:08:45.583 --> 1:08:48.545
Did I hear you just
rearranging your day for me?

1:08:49.546 --> 1:08:50.922
Maybe.

1:08:50.964 --> 1:08:52.340
And you're welcome.

1:08:52.382 --> 1:08:54.968
Thank you.

1:08:55.010 --> 1:08:56.302
You and your mom?

1:08:56.344 --> 1:08:57.971
Yeah, at Coney Island.

1:08:58.013 --> 1:08:59.472
KAT:
The Wonder Wheel.

1:08:59.514 --> 1:09:01.349
Well, we actually called it
"the wishing wheel."

1:09:01.391 --> 1:09:03.101
Yeah. We loved going out there.

1:09:03.143 --> 1:09:05.437
Although the last time
that I took her out there,

1:09:05.478 --> 1:09:06.980
it was closed
'cause it was winter.

1:09:07.022 --> 1:09:09.024
It was, like, right before
she passed away.

1:09:09.065 --> 1:09:10.900
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No, no.

1:09:10.942 --> 1:09:13.153
It-It's okay.
I like talking about her.

1:09:13.194 --> 1:09:17.866
It happened a while ago
when Lou was like five, but...

1:09:17.907 --> 1:09:22.579
they definitely got to spend
some good times together.

1:09:22.620 --> 1:09:25.999
And it's crazy how much of her
I see in Lou.

1:09:26.041 --> 1:09:27.876
You think she would've liked me?

1:09:27.917 --> 1:09:28.877
No.

1:09:28.918 --> 1:09:29.919
(laughing):
What?

1:09:29.961 --> 1:09:31.671
Yes, she would've loved you.

1:09:31.713 --> 1:09:33.298
She would've thought
you were amazing.

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:35.717
I mean, she might have
questioned a few things.

1:09:35.759 --> 1:09:37.635
She was very...

1:09:37.677 --> 1:09:39.429
Well, she was
very self-sufficient.

1:09:39.471 --> 1:09:41.306
Well, I'm, like,
the most self-sufficient

1:09:41.348 --> 1:09:42.891
person on the planet.

1:09:42.932 --> 1:09:45.226
-I mean, I do more things
in one day than... -No, I know.

1:09:45.268 --> 1:09:47.187
I know you do.
I'm not saying that.

1:09:47.228 --> 1:09:48.396
I'm saying you have
a lot of people,

1:09:48.438 --> 1:09:49.689
you know,
kind of handling things.

1:09:49.731 --> 1:09:51.566
There's nothing wrong
with having help.

1:09:51.608 --> 1:09:53.109
-I mean, it doesn't mean
I'm helpless. -(chuckles)

1:09:53.151 --> 1:09:55.236
It just means that I have
a lot of things on my plate.

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:58.239
I know, but you might not need
as many people helping you

1:09:58.281 --> 1:09:59.949
as you think you do.

1:09:59.991 --> 1:10:02.285
So, what are you saying?

1:10:02.327 --> 1:10:05.038
You want me to try being alone?

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.581
Because I could go
be alone right now.

1:10:06.623 --> 1:10:08.208
No, no, uh, let's be clear.

1:10:08.249 --> 1:10:11.336
"Alone" means without help,
not alone without me.

1:10:11.378 --> 1:10:13.505
Wait.

1:10:13.546 --> 1:10:15.465
Is this a challenge?

1:10:15.507 --> 1:10:16.883
Now you get it.

1:10:16.925 --> 1:10:18.677
-What, are you challenging me?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1:10:18.718 --> 1:10:21.638
Yeah, but let's make it
a real challenge, okay?

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:23.682
-Okay.
-That means without doormen.

1:10:23.723 --> 1:10:25.767
-Without yes-Melissa.
-Fine.

1:10:25.809 --> 1:10:26.976
Without cooks,

1:10:27.018 --> 1:10:29.187
without cleaners,
without hair extenders.

1:10:29.229 --> 1:10:31.022
-(laughs)
-Yeah, this is serious.

1:10:31.064 --> 1:10:32.732
Without live-feeding.

1:10:32.774 --> 1:10:34.859
Without constant
filming updates.

1:10:34.901 --> 1:10:37.404
Without all that little stuff.
Gone.

1:10:37.445 --> 1:10:39.489
Okay. I can do that.

1:10:39.531 --> 1:10:41.533
-Okay.
-What are you gonna do?

1:10:41.574 --> 1:10:43.493
Me? I'm...
You know, I'm gonna be there.

1:10:43.535 --> 1:10:44.869
I'm gonna monitor.

1:10:44.911 --> 1:10:45.912
Mm.

1:10:45.954 --> 1:10:47.372
Nice try, buddy.

1:10:47.414 --> 1:10:48.957
-Okay.
-(laughing): What?

1:10:50.291 --> 1:10:52.252
You're gonna get
on social media.

1:10:52.293 --> 1:10:53.545
-No.
-Yes.

1:10:53.586 --> 1:10:55.088
Come on, that's...
This is about you.

1:10:55.130 --> 1:10:56.589
You're gonna go on social media.

1:10:56.631 --> 1:10:59.634
You're gonna have Snapchat
and Instagram and TikTok.

1:10:59.676 --> 1:11:01.761
-You're gonna do a dance! Yes!
-This is about you.

1:11:01.803 --> 1:11:03.096
-Don't flip it.
-No, listen.

1:11:03.138 --> 1:11:04.431
Why are you so judgmental?

1:11:04.472 --> 1:11:05.765
It's so crazy.

1:11:05.807 --> 1:11:08.518
No, look, this is
gonna be a great thing.

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:10.937
It's an amazing platform
for you as a teacher.

1:11:10.979 --> 1:11:12.355
-(sighs)
-Seriously.

1:11:12.397 --> 1:11:14.941
If you don't do it,
I'm not doing it.

1:11:15.984 --> 1:11:17.569
Okay.

1:11:17.610 --> 1:11:19.195
(birds squawking)

1:11:19.237 --> 1:11:22.907
CHARLIE: So, this is
your little getaway?

1:11:22.949 --> 1:11:23.908
(door banging)

1:11:23.950 --> 1:11:25.869
Nope. It's locked.

1:11:34.002 --> 1:11:35.837
Nothing under there?

1:11:35.879 --> 1:11:37.922
Gosh. Dang it.

1:11:37.964 --> 1:11:39.591
Jeff, can you...

1:11:39.632 --> 1:11:41.134
No, no, th-that's cheating.

1:11:41.176 --> 1:11:43.636
Come on. What are you gonna do?

1:11:43.678 --> 1:11:44.888
You got a little problem.

1:11:44.929 --> 1:11:46.306
Sometimes you just
got to concede.

1:11:46.348 --> 1:11:47.557
It's okay.

1:11:56.149 --> 1:11:58.276
(alarm blaring)

1:11:58.318 --> 1:12:00.987
You really like to win.

1:12:01.029 --> 1:12:03.490
Yes! (grunts, laughs)

1:12:04.366 --> 1:12:06.576
Coming?

1:12:09.788 --> 1:12:12.791
I'm sorry I couldn't find
the wine glasses.

1:12:12.832 --> 1:12:14.918
-It's better.
-(laughs)

1:12:17.379 --> 1:12:19.339
-Living room.
-(computer chimes)

1:12:19.381 --> 1:12:21.341
(whirring)

1:12:21.383 --> 1:12:22.384
Ugh, this...

1:12:22.425 --> 1:12:23.843
Uh, no. Sound.

1:12:23.885 --> 1:12:25.095
(computer chimes)

1:12:25.136 --> 1:12:27.347
-(laughing): Oh, my God.
-(horse neighs on TV)

1:12:27.389 --> 1:12:30.725
-Jesus!
-Whose house is this?

1:12:30.767 --> 1:12:32.227
Well, that actually
could be nice

1:12:32.268 --> 1:12:34.562
to offset the breeze
from the broken window.

1:12:34.604 --> 1:12:36.439
-We can make s'mores.
-I like s'mores.

1:12:36.481 --> 1:12:37.816
-Me, too.
-Yeah.

1:12:37.857 --> 1:12:40.735
* What comes after love... *

1:12:40.777 --> 1:12:44.823
I am going to make us
these smoothies all by myself.

1:12:44.864 --> 1:12:48.284
* I don't think my heart
was made to break this much *

1:12:48.326 --> 1:12:51.830
* Tell me there's
a happy ever after us... *

1:12:51.871 --> 1:12:53.623
(gasps)

1:12:53.665 --> 1:12:55.709
I think you may have
forgotten this.

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.627
ESTHER: Jesus, he's had
an account for 45 minutes,

1:12:57.669 --> 1:12:59.838
and he already has
half a million followers.

1:12:59.879 --> 1:13:00.922
-Oh, my God. Look.
-STUDENT: Half a million?

1:13:00.964 --> 1:13:02.257
Now you need your own web page.

1:13:02.298 --> 1:13:05.218
Already created it on Wix.com.

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:06.678
"Numbers Neva Lie."

1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:08.304
-Oh, that's perfect.
-That is a good one.

1:13:08.346 --> 1:13:10.724
-I love that. Do you love that?
-Yeah, yeah, I do like it.

1:13:10.765 --> 1:13:12.976
So, what do you want
your caption to be, Mr. G?

1:13:14.436 --> 1:13:16.730
KAT:
"If you sit in the question,

1:13:16.771 --> 1:13:19.149
the answer will find you."

1:13:23.278 --> 1:13:25.864
(laughs)

1:13:25.905 --> 1:13:28.408
Sorry, I was checking out
this guy on Instagram.

1:13:28.450 --> 1:13:29.951
Oh. Should I be jealous?

1:13:29.993 --> 1:13:32.954
He sounds very interesting
and handsome.

1:13:32.996 --> 1:13:35.373
Just posting about
all this math stuff.

1:13:35.415 --> 1:13:36.750
Oh, one of those.

1:13:36.791 --> 1:13:38.960
Brought you an apple.

1:13:43.214 --> 1:13:45.592
* *

1:13:45.633 --> 1:13:48.136
Happy birthday, part one.

1:13:49.137 --> 1:13:50.764
Oh. Thank you.

1:13:50.805 --> 1:13:52.140
-(laughs)
-Yeah, on my last birthday,

1:13:52.182 --> 1:13:54.142
I was at a math conference
in the Poconos.

1:13:54.184 --> 1:13:55.435
(laughs):
Oh!

1:13:55.477 --> 1:13:57.270
-I have a lot to live up to.
-Yes.

1:13:57.312 --> 1:13:58.813
-Open it!
-Okay.

1:14:03.193 --> 1:14:07.197
Like, a handkerchief or...

1:14:07.238 --> 1:14:08.865
Turn around.

1:14:08.907 --> 1:14:11.576
Oh, it's a blindfold.

1:14:11.618 --> 1:14:13.745
-(Kat laughing)
-Oh.

1:14:13.787 --> 1:14:15.580
I'm a little taken aback.

1:14:15.622 --> 1:14:18.625
I, uh, didn't know
this was your thing,

1:14:18.667 --> 1:14:22.629
-but whatever you're... into.
-Shh.

1:14:22.671 --> 1:14:24.464
-KAT: Okay, straight ahead.
-CHARLIE: Okay.

1:14:24.506 --> 1:14:26.049
I got to say,
I'm getting excited.

1:14:26.091 --> 1:14:27.425
-You should be.
-(laughing): Okay.

1:14:27.467 --> 1:14:28.635
Wait, turn around.

1:14:28.677 --> 1:14:30.345
It's not a piÃ±ata.

1:14:30.387 --> 1:14:31.721
Maybe. Okay.

1:14:31.763 --> 1:14:33.056
That's it, right there.

1:14:33.098 --> 1:14:34.933
-That's where I need you.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1:14:34.974 --> 1:14:37.185
-You ready?
-Okay.

1:14:48.279 --> 1:14:49.614
Happy birthday.

1:14:49.656 --> 1:14:51.157
No.

1:14:51.199 --> 1:14:53.284
How?

1:14:53.326 --> 1:14:55.662
I know a guy who knows a guy.

1:14:57.372 --> 1:14:59.749
Come on.

1:15:02.210 --> 1:15:04.879
CHARLIE: Okay, so we're on
the wishing wheel.

1:15:04.921 --> 1:15:07.549
-KAT: Yes.
-CHARLIE: Go ahead.

1:15:11.219 --> 1:15:12.679
'Kay, done.

1:15:12.721 --> 1:15:14.723
Your turn. Make a wish.

1:15:15.724 --> 1:15:17.684
I already got it.

1:15:17.726 --> 1:15:19.936
* *

1:15:31.906 --> 1:15:33.867
KAT (over speakers):
* Since you came around *

1:15:33.908 --> 1:15:35.660
* You're testing my faith *

1:15:35.702 --> 1:15:37.245
* I'm praying out loud *

1:15:37.287 --> 1:15:38.371
KAT (chuckling):
Yeah.

1:15:38.413 --> 1:15:40.498
* I feel it in my chest... *

1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:42.459
-21!
-Yes!

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:43.543
-(cheering)
-Yeah!

1:15:43.585 --> 1:15:44.794
-Yeah!
-Hey.

1:15:44.836 --> 1:15:46.379
Come on. Okay. Sorry, sorry.

1:15:46.421 --> 1:15:47.797
Great day, you guys.

1:15:47.839 --> 1:15:49.883
We are finished.
Grab your stuff.

1:15:49.924 --> 1:15:51.885
-(kids murmuring)
-LOU: I'm ready.

1:15:51.926 --> 1:15:53.553
KAT:
You are. You're gonna be great.

1:15:53.595 --> 1:15:55.430
-STUDENT: Yo, is that Bastian?
-KAT: Amazing. -LOU: Thanks.

1:15:55.472 --> 1:15:57.557
-BASTIAN: Yo. What's up, kids?
-STUDENT: Oh, my God, Bastian!

1:15:57.599 --> 1:15:58.725
(excited chatter)

1:15:58.767 --> 1:15:59.851
Wait, what's going on?

1:15:59.893 --> 1:16:01.561
He insisted on coming.

1:16:01.603 --> 1:16:04.147
Hey, come on, now. Your parents
are waiting for you outside.

1:16:04.189 --> 1:16:06.149
Okay. See you later, guys.
See you. Bye.

1:16:06.191 --> 1:16:07.734
I tried to give you a heads-up,

1:16:07.776 --> 1:16:09.069
but somebody wasn't
answering her phone.

1:16:09.110 --> 1:16:10.570
No, no.
There are no phones at school.

1:16:10.612 --> 1:16:12.280
-What are you guys doing here?
-You got nominated

1:16:12.322 --> 1:16:15.950
for Best Pop Vocal Performance
at the Grammys.

1:16:15.992 --> 1:16:17.077
What?!

1:16:17.118 --> 1:16:18.411
"Marry Me"...
(continues in Spanish)

1:16:18.453 --> 1:16:20.747
-Yeah. -Oh, my God!
-We got nominated!

1:16:20.789 --> 1:16:22.749
-Can you believe it?
-Congratulations.

1:16:22.791 --> 1:16:23.875
-Oh, my God, yes!
-(chuckles): Congratulations.

1:16:23.917 --> 1:16:26.419
-Yes. Oh, my God.
-Wow.

1:16:26.461 --> 1:16:27.712
I can't believe this.

1:16:27.754 --> 1:16:28.963
It was only
a matter of time, babe.

1:16:29.005 --> 1:16:30.590
-Oh, my God.
-You should tell her.

1:16:30.632 --> 1:16:32.300
Oh, yeah.
So, um, Bastian's concert

1:16:32.342 --> 1:16:34.511
at Madison Square Garden
on Friday is streaming

1:16:34.552 --> 1:16:36.846
across multiple platforms,
so there's loads of exposure.

1:16:36.888 --> 1:16:38.807
BASTIAN:
Yeah, he thought we could

1:16:38.848 --> 1:16:41.059
surprise everyone
and do "Marry Me."

1:16:41.101 --> 1:16:42.894
COLIN: Right. Now, the ballots
are out next week,

1:16:42.936 --> 1:16:45.605
and nobody's seen you two
together since...

1:16:45.647 --> 1:16:47.524
well, you know, a while.

1:16:47.565 --> 1:16:49.317
Um...

1:16:49.359 --> 1:16:51.277
You know, we don't...
we don't have any

1:16:51.319 --> 1:16:53.571
-of the dancers in town.
-BASTIAN: No, no, no.

1:16:53.613 --> 1:16:55.073
It's short notice. I-I don't...

1:16:55.115 --> 1:16:57.033
No, but wait. But we can do
the ballad version.

1:16:57.075 --> 1:17:00.370
The one that we wanted
to release after the ceremony.

1:17:03.623 --> 1:17:05.458
I don't know, Sebastian.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:06.835
"Sebastian"?

1:17:10.588 --> 1:17:12.590
Come on. "Sebastian"?

1:17:12.632 --> 1:17:13.675
That's his real name.

1:17:13.717 --> 1:17:14.968
Look, can I just...

1:17:15.010 --> 1:17:16.636
I-I know this is a little...

1:17:16.678 --> 1:17:18.221
I'm not trying to make
a thing here,

1:17:18.263 --> 1:17:20.682
but this is the song that
you were gonna get married to.

1:17:20.724 --> 1:17:22.517
This is huge for me.

1:17:22.559 --> 1:17:24.519
Totally. Totally.

1:17:25.311 --> 1:17:27.063
You should come.
I want you to come.

1:17:27.105 --> 1:17:29.315
Are you gonna come with us?

1:17:31.026 --> 1:17:32.736
Right. Okay. I mean, it's...

1:17:32.777 --> 1:17:34.320
it's not a big deal.

1:17:34.362 --> 1:17:36.865
The nomination is.

1:17:37.824 --> 1:17:39.784
So please don't be upset.

1:17:39.826 --> 1:17:41.661
I-I'm just being a jerk.

1:17:41.703 --> 1:17:43.163
And I'm sorry.

1:17:43.204 --> 1:17:46.166
I just want you to remember
award shows are bullshit

1:17:46.207 --> 1:17:49.002
and you don't need them
to tell you how good you are.

1:17:49.794 --> 1:17:51.379
I know.

1:17:51.421 --> 1:17:52.797
Just do me a favor.

1:17:52.839 --> 1:17:55.759
Don't say "Sebastian."

1:17:55.800 --> 1:17:57.052
(door opens)

1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:01.014
See you, babe.

1:18:01.056 --> 1:18:02.724
-See you soon.
-Hey.

1:18:02.766 --> 1:18:04.100
We got to schedule
a band rehearsal

1:18:04.142 --> 1:18:06.144
-and a wardrobe fitting.
-Okay.

1:18:06.186 --> 1:18:07.562
-Now?
-Yes, now.

1:18:07.604 --> 1:18:08.772
-Yes.
-Okay. You good?

1:18:08.813 --> 1:18:10.482
-I'm good.
-Are you sure?

1:18:10.523 --> 1:18:12.108
Okay, I'll call you.

1:18:12.150 --> 1:18:15.487
MELISSA: This is gonna be
so exciting! (squeals)

1:18:25.121 --> 1:18:26.873
Hey.

1:18:28.041 --> 1:18:30.001
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:18:30.043 --> 1:18:32.587
Just keeping Tank company.

1:18:32.629 --> 1:18:34.881
Good dog.

1:18:37.092 --> 1:18:39.636
You're afraid she'll fall back
in love with Bastian

1:18:39.678 --> 1:18:41.721
and dump you?

1:18:41.763 --> 1:18:44.391
No.

1:18:44.432 --> 1:18:45.934
Yeah.

1:18:45.975 --> 1:18:48.269
I'd be afraid of that, too.

1:18:49.938 --> 1:18:52.148
(audience cheering)

1:18:53.942 --> 1:18:56.236
(cheering continues)

1:18:56.277 --> 1:18:58.238
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:18:58.279 --> 1:19:00.740
Thank you. Um...

1:19:00.782 --> 1:19:03.785
I have a little surprise
for you tonight.

1:19:04.869 --> 1:19:07.414
There is a woman

1:19:07.455 --> 1:19:09.833
-who's been my heart...
-(cheering)

1:19:09.874 --> 1:19:12.002
and my biggest inspiration.

1:19:23.221 --> 1:19:25.098
She always gonna be my family.

1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:26.933
(lush orchestral ballad begins)

1:19:26.975 --> 1:19:29.602
And we're always gonna have...

1:19:29.644 --> 1:19:31.271
"Marry Me."

1:19:31.312 --> 1:19:33.314
(cheering)

1:19:40.697 --> 1:19:43.324
(cheering over computer)

1:19:46.036 --> 1:19:47.912
Crowd's going bananas.

1:19:47.954 --> 1:19:50.123
LOU:
I know.

1:19:50.165 --> 1:19:52.959
I don't know if I'd say
"bananas," but...

1:19:57.339 --> 1:20:00.342
* I've never seen forever *

1:20:00.383 --> 1:20:03.511
* I've never seen forever
in the wild *

1:20:03.553 --> 1:20:08.975
* But now I'm lookin',
now I'm lookin' in its eyes *

1:20:09.017 --> 1:20:11.478
* Baby, you're my shelter *

1:20:11.519 --> 1:20:15.273
* Shelter from
a broken paradise *

1:20:15.315 --> 1:20:21.071
* I couldn't dream it
any better if I tried *

1:20:22.197 --> 1:20:24.657
* True love gotta

1:20:24.699 --> 1:20:27.744
* Church bells,
let 'em ring, ring, ring *

1:20:27.786 --> 1:20:30.372
* You're the queen,

1:20:40.006 --> 1:20:42.425
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

1:20:42.467 --> 1:20:45.387
* For the rest,
the rest of your life *

1:20:45.428 --> 1:20:48.306
* I'm-a fly her off to Vegas *

1:20:48.348 --> 1:20:50.558
* We could tie it up tonight,
no patience *

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:53.812
* Take my last name,
put it where your name is *

1:20:53.853 --> 1:20:56.898
* Have they ever seen
a love this famous? *

1:20:56.940 --> 1:20:59.526
* They never, no, they never *

1:20:59.567 --> 1:21:02.696

1:22:22.192 --> 1:22:24.235

1:22:39.959 --> 1:22:44.047

1:22:44.089 --> 1:22:48.301
* Ah-ah-ah. *

1:22:48.343 --> 1:22:50.595
-(song ends)
-(cheering)

1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:07.028
Get your ass to the Garden.

1:23:09.489 --> 1:23:12.075
(pop music playing faintly)

1:23:12.117 --> 1:23:14.369
(indistinct chatter)

1:23:16.705 --> 1:23:17.831
MELISSA:
Yes!

1:23:17.872 --> 1:23:19.791
-Yeah. Pose.
-We did it.

1:23:19.833 --> 1:23:21.543
MELISSA:
We look so good!

1:23:24.129 --> 1:23:25.380
You guys's chemistry
is off the charts.

1:23:25.422 --> 1:23:26.923
BASTIAN:
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1:23:26.965 --> 1:23:28.717
MELISSA:
And the audience felt it.

1:23:28.758 --> 1:23:31.344
(playing soft pop intro)

1:23:31.386 --> 1:23:33.596
(excited chatter, applause)

1:23:35.306 --> 1:23:37.809
(Bastian singing in Spanish)

1:23:45.442 --> 1:23:46.693
-You know?
-Yeah.

1:23:46.735 --> 1:23:48.445
-CHARLIE: Hey.
-(laughing): Oh, my God.

1:23:48.486 --> 1:23:51.031
-I didn't know you were coming.
-Hey.

1:23:51.072 --> 1:23:52.699
No, I wasn't,
and then I was like,

1:23:52.741 --> 1:23:54.701
"I'm gonna get down there,"
and-and...

1:23:54.743 --> 1:23:55.994
but I didn't have a pass,

1:23:56.036 --> 1:23:57.787
so I couldn't get in at first,
and then luckily,

1:23:57.829 --> 1:23:59.873
someone saw me
and they brought me backstage

1:23:59.914 --> 1:24:02.792
and then brought me over here.

1:24:02.834 --> 1:24:04.085
So, you didn't see it?

1:24:04.127 --> 1:24:06.713
No, no, I did. I did. Yeah.

1:24:06.755 --> 1:24:08.548
Uh, did you like it?

1:24:08.590 --> 1:24:10.884
I-I... I thought it was amazing.

1:24:10.925 --> 1:24:12.886
I-I was really happy for you.

1:24:12.927 --> 1:24:14.262
I think you're amazing.

1:24:14.304 --> 1:24:15.722
(chuckles)

1:24:15.764 --> 1:24:17.891
Can you guys... You know,
fine, we'll go over here.

1:24:17.932 --> 1:24:19.392
-COLIN: Oh, yeah.
-(laughs)

1:24:19.434 --> 1:24:21.686
(continues singing in Spanish)

1:24:25.482 --> 1:24:27.942
It was great. It was...

1:24:27.984 --> 1:24:29.986
Social media is exploding.

1:24:30.028 --> 1:24:33.073
It's, uh... They're even saying
you guys are back together.

1:24:33.114 --> 1:24:35.909
Well, if social media says
it's true, it must be true.

1:24:35.950 --> 1:24:38.536
-(chuckles)
-(Charlie sighs)

1:24:40.413 --> 1:24:41.956
Wait, are you okay?

1:24:41.998 --> 1:24:43.958
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm good. I'm just...

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.254
I'm looking at you here,
and it... it all worked out.

1:24:48.296 --> 1:24:51.091
I mean, no one even remembers
the meltdown.

1:24:51.132 --> 1:24:53.176
I know. It's crazy, right?

1:24:53.218 --> 1:24:54.427
(chuckles)

1:24:54.469 --> 1:24:56.680
I'm really happy for you.

1:24:56.721 --> 1:24:58.890
You deserve it.

1:24:58.932 --> 1:25:00.225
You really do.

1:25:00.266 --> 1:25:03.520
(Bastian continues singing
in Spanish)

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:09.984
God, he can sing.

1:25:10.026 --> 1:25:13.405
* Dame un segundo,
un segundo chance... *

1:25:13.446 --> 1:25:15.156
"Segundochance."

1:25:15.198 --> 1:25:17.659
What-what is that?
Second chances?

1:25:18.952 --> 1:25:20.704
It's just a song.

1:25:20.745 --> 1:25:22.122
Maybe.

1:25:22.163 --> 1:25:25.166
Maybe it's something more.

1:25:27.669 --> 1:25:28.962
What's going on?

1:25:29.004 --> 1:25:30.755
Look, I know this is a big deal,

1:25:30.797 --> 1:25:33.049
and that's why I wanted
to come down here,

1:25:33.091 --> 1:25:34.884
but I don't fit.

1:25:34.926 --> 1:25:37.971
And I think that's
objectively pretty true.

1:25:38.013 --> 1:25:40.849
-And we don't need to pr...
-So, what are you saying?

1:25:42.434 --> 1:25:44.519
Look, if I'm being honest
with myself,

1:25:44.561 --> 1:25:46.646
I real...
I really came down here

1:25:46.688 --> 1:25:49.482
just to say that this...
I don't think this works.

1:25:49.524 --> 1:25:51.109
-(song ends)
-(cheering and applause)

1:25:51.151 --> 1:25:53.862
BASTIAN: Can I have a bottle
of Hennessy X.O? Yeah?

1:25:54.696 --> 1:25:56.656
Are you breaking up with me?

1:25:56.698 --> 1:25:59.159
BASTIAN:
Katarina. Kat.

1:25:59.200 --> 1:26:01.036
Kat, come here.

1:26:01.077 --> 1:26:03.079
-Come here.
-It's okay. Go.

1:26:03.121 --> 1:26:04.497
-Go.
-No.

1:26:04.539 --> 1:26:05.915
-BASTIAN: Come here.
-What are you saying?

1:26:05.957 --> 1:26:07.667
-Tell me what you...
-MELISSA: Hey, come on.

1:26:07.709 --> 1:26:08.710
-What-what do you mean?
-Everybody's calling you.

1:26:08.752 --> 1:26:10.128
CHARLIE:
It's nothing. Talk later.

1:26:10.170 --> 1:26:11.254
-Go. Go.
-BASTIAN: Come here, baby.

1:26:11.296 --> 1:26:12.464
CHARLIE:
It's fine. Keep going.

1:26:12.505 --> 1:26:13.882
-Come on.
-GUESTS: Kat! Kat! Kat!

1:26:13.923 --> 1:26:16.760
Kat! Kat! Kat! Kat! Kat!

1:26:16.801 --> 1:26:19.220
-(laughing)
-(guests whooping)

1:26:20.430 --> 1:26:23.850
Guys, raise your glasses

1:26:23.892 --> 1:26:27.562
to the woman who made
all this possible tonight.

1:26:28.730 --> 1:26:30.106
To you.

1:26:30.148 --> 1:26:31.816
To you, Kat.

1:26:31.858 --> 1:26:33.693
-Salud.
-GUESTS: Salud.

1:26:33.735 --> 1:26:35.403
-(guests cheering)
-Salud, salud.

1:26:35.445 --> 1:26:37.530
MAN:
Yes, cheers!

1:26:38.615 --> 1:26:40.867
MAN:
It's for you, Kat!

1:26:42.243 --> 1:26:44.496
(piano playing simple melody)

1:26:51.670 --> 1:26:53.922
(simple melody continues)

1:27:07.519 --> 1:27:09.562
* Always knew you *

1:27:09.604 --> 1:27:13.566
* Even when I didn't know you *

1:27:13.608 --> 1:27:18.321
* Don't make sense, but it do *

1:27:18.363 --> 1:27:21.616
* I was on my way to you *

1:27:22.826 --> 1:27:26.871
* Every teardrop fell so heavy *

1:27:26.913 --> 1:27:32.752
* Hurt like hell,
but heaven sent me through *

1:27:34.129 --> 1:27:36.965
* I was on my way to you *

1:27:41.928 --> 1:27:45.890
* And every heartbreak was
a yellow brick road *

1:27:45.932 --> 1:27:49.686
* Pointing me straight,
just taking me home *

1:27:49.728 --> 1:27:51.604
* I was never lost *

1:27:51.646 --> 1:27:55.442
* I was just passing through *

1:27:55.483 --> 1:27:59.821
* I was on my way to you *

1:28:00.989 --> 1:28:04.492
* Hope was hopeless,
faith was running *

1:28:04.534 --> 1:28:10.331
* Didn't notice
you were coming through *

1:28:10.373 --> 1:28:13.668
* You were on your way, too *

1:28:15.837 --> 1:28:19.632
* And you don't believe
in meant to be *

1:28:19.674 --> 1:28:24.346
* But somehow you were
meant for me, it's true *

1:28:24.387 --> 1:28:25.764
(bell jingling)

1:28:25.805 --> 1:28:29.434
* Yeah, you were
on your way, too *

1:28:31.353 --> 1:28:35.565
* Every heartbreak was
a yellow brick road *

1:28:35.607 --> 1:28:38.818
* Pointing me straight,
just taking me home *

1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:40.653
* I was never lost *

1:28:40.695 --> 1:28:44.699
* I was just passing through *

1:28:44.741 --> 1:28:48.578
* I was on my way to you *

1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:52.207
* I was
on my way to you *

1:28:52.248 --> 1:28:56.419
* I was on my way to you *

1:28:56.461 --> 1:29:01.633
* I was on my way to you, oh *

1:29:01.675 --> 1:29:05.387
* I'm on my way,
on my way to you *

1:29:05.428 --> 1:29:07.222
* On my way *

1:29:07.263 --> 1:29:09.516
* On my way to you *

1:29:09.557 --> 1:29:11.601
* On my way *

1:29:11.643 --> 1:29:16.356
* On my way to you, oh *

1:29:16.398 --> 1:29:20.151
* I'm on my way, I'm on my way *

1:29:20.193 --> 1:29:22.237
* On my way *

1:29:22.278 --> 1:29:24.155
* On my way to you *

1:29:24.197 --> 1:29:26.157
* On my way *

1:29:26.199 --> 1:29:31.413
* On my way to you, oh *

1:29:31.454 --> 1:29:35.709
* And every heartbreak was
a yellow brick road *

1:29:35.750 --> 1:29:39.546
* Pointing me straight,
just taking me home *

1:29:39.587 --> 1:29:41.464
* I was never lost *

1:29:41.506 --> 1:29:44.801
* I was just passing through *

1:29:44.843 --> 1:29:47.470
* On my way to you *

1:29:47.512 --> 1:29:49.014
* On my way *

1:29:49.055 --> 1:29:51.349
-* On my way to you *
-* Ooh... *

1:29:51.391 --> 1:29:54.561
* On my way, on my way to you *

1:29:54.602 --> 1:29:55.770
* On my way *

1:29:55.812 --> 1:30:00.066
* On my way to you *

1:30:00.108 --> 1:30:01.693
* Oh, my darling *

1:30:01.735 --> 1:30:04.612
* I'm on my way. *

1:30:04.654 --> 1:30:07.574
(piano playing gentle outro)

1:30:12.203 --> 1:30:14.164
(song ends)

1:30:19.461 --> 1:30:21.338
COLIN: Come on, Charlie.
Don't be stupid.

1:30:21.379 --> 1:30:23.590
Well, it's a little late
for that.

1:30:24.632 --> 1:30:26.509
-You got another one.
-Take it, please.

1:30:26.551 --> 1:30:28.178
It-it's made out to the school.

1:30:28.219 --> 1:30:30.555
It just feels a little unseemly.

1:30:30.597 --> 1:30:32.307
-I didn't do it for the money.
-I know,

1:30:32.349 --> 1:30:34.851
but if you don't take the check,
then the prenup's not binding.

1:30:34.893 --> 1:30:36.936
You could sell your story.

1:30:36.978 --> 1:30:39.606
-You could write a book.
-(scoffs)

1:30:39.647 --> 1:30:41.858
Is that what you think of me?

1:30:43.777 --> 1:30:45.278
Oh, come on, Charlie.

1:30:45.320 --> 1:30:46.946
I was rooting for you.

1:30:46.988 --> 1:30:49.783
I wanted it to work.
The whole world wanted it to.

1:30:49.824 --> 1:30:52.952
I'm sorry to disappoint you
and the world.

1:30:52.994 --> 1:30:54.496
You're disappointing yourself.

1:30:54.537 --> 1:30:57.290
I'm protecting myself.

1:30:57.332 --> 1:30:58.792
I can't get away from her.

1:30:58.833 --> 1:31:02.629
There's always a poster,
a Vitamix or a billboard.

1:31:02.671 --> 1:31:05.507
You know they're not together?

1:31:08.718 --> 1:31:10.679
Maybe not.

1:31:11.596 --> 1:31:13.139
But, Colin,
can you do me a favor?

1:31:13.181 --> 1:31:15.809
Will you be there for her
when she figures it all out?

1:31:15.850 --> 1:31:17.894
She's gonna need someone.

1:31:23.983 --> 1:31:26.569
* *

1:31:26.611 --> 1:31:28.363
FALLON: On Friday's show,
we'll be talking

1:31:28.405 --> 1:31:30.532
to the beautiful Kat Valdez

1:31:30.573 --> 1:31:32.325
about her new hit single
"On My Way,"

1:31:32.367 --> 1:31:35.662
with a special surprise guest
that you won't want to miss.

1:31:36.663 --> 1:31:38.415
(Tank snoring)

1:31:38.456 --> 1:31:40.417
-Night.
-Night.

1:31:40.458 --> 1:31:42.836
NARRATOR (on TV):
...established by jaw snapping,

1:31:42.877 --> 1:31:46.131
headbutting or tail slapping.

1:31:46.172 --> 1:31:49.509
Physical dominance
establishes the leader.

1:31:49.551 --> 1:31:53.680
Pods can travel in herds
of up to hundreds of dolphins

1:31:53.722 --> 1:31:56.057
and can cover 80 miles.

1:31:56.099 --> 1:31:58.143
(broadcast fades)

1:31:59.394 --> 1:32:01.646
* *

1:32:11.197 --> 1:32:14.200
Mathalon, baby,
with the Mathalonians.

1:32:14.242 --> 1:32:16.077
-Headed to Peoria, Illinois.
-Hey.

1:32:16.119 --> 1:32:17.829
-Coming to get ya.
-(kids chattering)

1:32:17.871 --> 1:32:19.873
-Wait, what are you doing?
-Oh, we're live.

1:32:19.914 --> 1:32:23.043
Say something smart
or witty or, uh, numeric.

1:32:23.084 --> 1:32:25.587
-(Charlie clears throat)
-5,000 people are watching.

1:32:25.628 --> 1:32:26.921
Bye.

1:32:26.963 --> 1:32:28.631
-Charles.
-I'm serious.

1:32:28.673 --> 1:32:30.425
Um, I can't. Turn it off.

1:32:30.467 --> 1:32:32.635
Are you at some point
gonna be fun again?

1:32:32.677 --> 1:32:33.887
I was never fun.

1:32:33.928 --> 1:32:36.306
That's true,
and I love you anyway.

1:32:36.348 --> 1:32:38.183
You know, you're not always
gonna feel this way.

1:32:38.224 --> 1:32:40.977
You're lucky you made it.
We were gonna leave without you.

1:32:41.019 --> 1:32:42.520
CHARLIE:
Parker. No, we weren't.

1:32:42.562 --> 1:32:44.981
-Come on, let's go, Percy.
-We absolutely were.

1:32:45.899 --> 1:32:48.401
ANIKAH: I loved you
and Charlie as a couple.

1:32:48.443 --> 1:32:50.779
Are you still friends?

1:32:51.905 --> 1:32:54.032
Is it okay if I ask you that?

1:32:55.033 --> 1:32:56.159
Yeah.

1:32:56.201 --> 1:32:58.203
Um, sure.

1:32:58.244 --> 1:32:59.746
Yeah. (chuckles)

1:32:59.788 --> 1:33:01.039
He seems like the sweetest man.

1:33:01.081 --> 1:33:03.124
You know, I actually DMed him

1:33:03.166 --> 1:33:06.002
to wish him luck
on his Mathalon tomorrow.

1:33:06.044 --> 1:33:09.798
He never answered, obviously.
(chuckles)

1:33:11.466 --> 1:33:13.385
Mathalon's tomorrow?

1:33:13.426 --> 1:33:14.594
Yeah.

1:33:14.636 --> 1:33:16.221
-(door closes)
-BASTIAN: Hey.

1:33:16.262 --> 1:33:17.681
Hey.

1:33:17.722 --> 1:33:18.973
I'll just fix that.

1:33:19.015 --> 1:33:21.017
BASTIAN:
Thank you.

1:33:22.310 --> 1:33:24.938
-Oh, I like that.
-Mm. Thank you.

1:33:24.979 --> 1:33:26.773
-BASTIAN: Nice.
-(audience cheering)

1:33:26.815 --> 1:33:28.608
FALLON:
So, we've been... we've been

1:33:28.650 --> 1:33:30.068
beating around the bush,
and I think that

1:33:30.110 --> 1:33:31.569
we should get right down to it.

1:33:31.611 --> 1:33:34.280
I mean, we all know that
you guys are not "together,"

1:33:34.322 --> 1:33:37.784
uh, yet you wrote "Marry Me"
for each other.

1:33:37.826 --> 1:33:40.620
Uh, Bastian wrote "Segundo"
for Kat.

1:33:40.662 --> 1:33:43.248
Kat wrote "On My Way"
for Bastian.

1:33:43.289 --> 1:33:46.251
I'd say the next song
should probably be, uh,

1:33:46.292 --> 1:33:49.212
-"Come On Already!" Am I right?
-(audience laughing)

1:33:49.254 --> 1:33:51.214
(chuckles) Let's see if
we can get these two guys

1:33:51.256 --> 1:33:53.466
to sing a little romantic duet
when we come back.

1:33:53.508 --> 1:33:55.010
-Ooh.
-AUDIENCE: Ooh.

1:33:55.051 --> 1:33:57.971
-Do not change that channel.
-(cheering and applause)

1:33:58.013 --> 1:34:00.056
(band playing upbeat music)

1:34:07.272 --> 1:34:10.358
I didn't write "On My Way"
for Bastian.

1:34:14.779 --> 1:34:16.448
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1:34:16.489 --> 1:34:20.910
I know it's an inopportune time
to have an epiphany, but...

1:34:20.952 --> 1:34:23.204
I don't want to go back.

1:34:26.249 --> 1:34:30.670
Someone told me that if you sit
in the question long enough,

1:34:30.712 --> 1:34:32.839
the answer finds you.

1:34:33.757 --> 1:34:36.009
And the answer is...

1:34:37.427 --> 1:34:40.722
I don't want to keep making
the same mistakes over and over.

1:34:42.724 --> 1:34:45.435
I want something different.

1:34:50.857 --> 1:34:54.069
-Come here.
-(audience gasping, murmuring)

1:34:59.741 --> 1:35:02.452
So, I'm guessing
no romantic duet.

1:35:02.494 --> 1:35:04.245
(cameras clicking rapidly)

1:35:04.287 --> 1:35:05.955
-Hey. -Kat!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:35:05.997 --> 1:35:07.499
-That's Kat Valdez.
-Kat! Kat, wait! -Over here!

1:35:07.540 --> 1:35:10.210
-Where you going? -Kat, hey!
How about a shot, huh?

1:35:10.251 --> 1:35:11.211
Peoria.

1:35:11.252 --> 1:35:13.588
-I'll get you a plane.
-No.

1:35:13.630 --> 1:35:15.423
I want to do this
by myself, okay?

1:35:15.465 --> 1:35:17.342
-Can't be that hard.
-PHOTOGRAPHER: Kat, come on.

1:35:17.384 --> 1:35:19.052
-Kat, where you headed?
-How about another shot?

1:35:19.094 --> 1:35:20.679
KAT:
Take me to the airport.

1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.055
Bye!

1:35:22.097 --> 1:35:23.723
COLIN:
Hey.

1:35:23.765 --> 1:35:25.350
That's not our car.

1:35:29.104 --> 1:35:30.939
Whoa. Is that Kat Valdez?

1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:32.732
Oh, my God. Kat Valdez?

1:35:32.774 --> 1:35:34.609
You're right.
What's she doing here?

1:35:34.651 --> 1:35:36.069
(people murmuring)

1:35:36.111 --> 1:35:38.863
Sorry. The last
connecting flight to Peoria

1:35:38.905 --> 1:35:41.116
is through Chicago,
but it's all sold out.

1:35:41.157 --> 1:35:42.575
-(sighs)
-If you fly tomorrow...

1:35:42.617 --> 1:35:44.786
Tonight. It has to be tonight.

1:35:44.828 --> 1:35:46.871
The Mathalon will be over
by noon tomorrow,

1:35:46.913 --> 1:35:49.165
and I promised I'd be there.

1:35:51.835 --> 1:35:56.089
I will give anyone $5,000 for
their standby slot to Chicago.

1:35:56.131 --> 1:35:59.926
It's illegal. You can't buy
someone else's ticket.

1:35:59.968 --> 1:36:01.553
-You can't?
-COLIN: Kat.

1:36:01.594 --> 1:36:04.264
Did you know it's illegal
to buy someone else's ticket?

1:36:04.305 --> 1:36:06.266
Uh, yeah. Everyone does.
(chuckles)

1:36:06.307 --> 1:36:08.351
Now, I can't get you a plane,

1:36:08.393 --> 1:36:10.562
but we got you
the last available ticket.

1:36:10.603 --> 1:36:11.813
It's in coach.

1:36:11.855 --> 1:36:13.565
-You're a lifesaver.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:36:13.606 --> 1:36:16.026
Tell me that
after you get there, okay?

1:36:16.067 --> 1:36:18.862
So, there's your passport
and some money.

1:36:18.903 --> 1:36:20.905
Go find your answer.

1:36:23.783 --> 1:36:26.369
-Okay.
-Go on.

1:36:26.411 --> 1:36:27.996
Bye.

1:36:29.581 --> 1:36:31.332
MAN (over intercom):
Ladies and gentlemen, due to

1:36:31.374 --> 1:36:33.043
freezing weather conditions
and some strong headwinds,

1:36:33.084 --> 1:36:35.003
we will be in flight
a little longer than usual,

1:36:35.045 --> 1:36:37.005
but we will get you there
by morning.

1:36:37.047 --> 1:36:38.757
-(passengers groaning)
-Excuse me, miss.

1:36:38.798 --> 1:36:41.301
I'd like to buy champagne
and caviar for the whole flight.

1:36:41.343 --> 1:36:44.012
I'm sorry. We only have
ham wraps, cheese cubes

1:36:44.054 --> 1:36:45.472
and Michelob ULTRA.

1:36:45.513 --> 1:36:48.099
Okay, well, then ham wraps
and Michelob ULTRA.

1:36:48.141 --> 1:36:49.809
(passengers murmuring happily)

1:36:49.851 --> 1:36:52.020
MAN:
What about the cheese cubes?

1:36:52.062 --> 1:36:54.189
Sure.
Cheese cubes, too. Why not?

1:36:54.230 --> 1:36:59.069
Um, also, who wants to sell me
a very heavy winter coat?

1:36:59.110 --> 1:37:00.653
(timer ticking)

1:37:00.695 --> 1:37:04.324
Uh, the answer is nine?

1:37:04.366 --> 1:37:06.534
-(bell dings)
-That answer is correct.

1:37:06.576 --> 1:37:08.745
-(cheering) -This round goes
to the Coolidge Pi-thons.

1:37:08.787 --> 1:37:09.871
Nice, Esther.

1:37:09.913 --> 1:37:11.247
Good job.

1:37:11.289 --> 1:37:13.375
-Go, Esther!
-(cheering continues)

1:37:17.420 --> 1:37:19.381
Where are the people
with the cars?

1:37:19.422 --> 1:37:21.257
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a phone charger?

1:37:21.299 --> 1:37:22.634
-I-I need...
-No. Sorry.

1:37:22.676 --> 1:37:23.760
-PARKER: I do.
-You...

1:37:23.802 --> 1:37:25.845
Colin called me, so...

1:37:25.887 --> 1:37:27.347
Is Charlie here?

1:37:27.389 --> 1:37:29.683
You know, I didn't tell him
I was coming.

1:37:29.724 --> 1:37:32.727
I didn't want to screw with him
on the big day, in case...

1:37:33.687 --> 1:37:36.523
You know, he's not good
with the back-and-forth,

1:37:36.564 --> 1:37:39.943
so I got to ask you, Kat,
are you...

1:37:42.153 --> 1:37:44.489
Is this for real?

1:37:45.365 --> 1:37:47.367
Well, I walked out on Fallon

1:37:47.409 --> 1:37:50.328
to freeze my toes off
in Peoria, so...

1:37:52.455 --> 1:37:54.165
Excellent point.

1:37:54.207 --> 1:37:56.042
I called an Uber.

1:37:56.835 --> 1:37:58.294
47 minutes?

1:37:58.336 --> 1:37:59.671
What?

1:37:59.713 --> 1:38:00.880
We're not gonna make it.

1:38:00.922 --> 1:38:02.340
Didn't they already start?

1:38:02.382 --> 1:38:04.467
Should we hitch a ride?
I don't know what...

1:38:04.509 --> 1:38:07.262
-(tires screeching)
-Wait!

1:38:11.016 --> 1:38:15.061
This woman,
this superstar, this icon,

1:38:15.103 --> 1:38:17.564
has flown in coach in stilettos

1:38:17.605 --> 1:38:20.483
to win back the unlikely
love of her life,

1:38:20.525 --> 1:38:23.903
who, against all odds,
she loves.

1:38:23.945 --> 1:38:25.572
And he loves her.

1:38:25.613 --> 1:38:26.865
He does, right?

1:38:26.906 --> 1:38:28.533
Completely.

1:38:28.575 --> 1:38:32.370
The next thing you say will
forecast not just their future

1:38:32.412 --> 1:38:34.914
but the future of-of anyone
who ever believed

1:38:34.956 --> 1:38:36.750
in the magic of a leap of faith.

1:38:36.791 --> 1:38:39.753
-Look... -She'll give you
a thousand dollars.

1:38:39.794 --> 1:38:42.172
The answer is 15.

1:38:42.213 --> 1:38:43.590
-(bell dings)
-The answer is correct.

1:38:43.631 --> 1:38:45.842
-Five points,
Trinity Numerators. -Yes!

1:38:45.884 --> 1:38:47.260
Yes! Get 'em!

1:38:48.053 --> 1:38:49.262
Congratulations.

1:38:49.304 --> 1:38:50.555
JUDGE:
After a break,

1:38:50.597 --> 1:38:52.640
we're moving
to a sudden-death round

1:38:52.682 --> 1:38:54.267
between the
three-time champions,

1:38:54.309 --> 1:38:56.353
-Trinity Numerators...
-NUMERATORS: Yes!

1:38:56.394 --> 1:38:59.147
...and the first-time finalists,
Coolidge Pi-thons.

1:38:59.189 --> 1:39:01.149
(excited chatter)

1:39:01.191 --> 1:39:02.275
Sudden death.

1:39:02.317 --> 1:39:03.777
-Ooh. Blast off.
-(chuckling)

1:39:03.818 --> 1:39:07.655
First up, Lou Gilbert
for the Coolidge Pi-thons.

1:39:07.697 --> 1:39:09.366
Choker better pray.

1:39:09.407 --> 1:39:11.117
-(laughter)
-Shut up.

1:39:11.159 --> 1:39:13.161
(Manny laughing)

1:39:13.203 --> 1:39:14.746
You laughing at that?

1:39:14.788 --> 1:39:16.456
(sighs) Look...

1:39:16.498 --> 1:39:18.458
I don't want to embarrass you.

1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:20.126
I know that's your daughter.

1:39:20.168 --> 1:39:22.128
-CHARLIE: Yeah?
-MANNY: I saw her last year.

1:39:22.170 --> 1:39:24.005
She's got stage fright.

1:39:24.047 --> 1:39:26.132
My daughter's fine.

1:39:26.174 --> 1:39:28.551
Look, I just think maybe
it would be easier on you

1:39:28.593 --> 1:39:30.845
if you guys
just conceded the title.

1:39:30.887 --> 1:39:32.597
-Concede?
-Mm-hmm.

1:39:32.639 --> 1:39:34.432
-Give you the trophy?
-No.

1:39:34.474 --> 1:39:37.519
It's more like you save
yourself from humiliation.

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.229
Huh?

1:39:40.313 --> 1:39:42.857
CHARLIE:
Okay, huddle up. Here we go.

1:39:42.899 --> 1:39:46.444
So, um, Coach Looney Tunes
over there wants to know

1:39:46.486 --> 1:39:48.822
if we just want to concede
and give him the trophy.

1:39:48.863 --> 1:39:50.824
-PI-THONS: No!
-That doesn't even make sense.

1:39:50.865 --> 1:39:52.575
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
-Four in a row, baby.

1:39:52.617 --> 1:39:56.204
How about we go show him
what the Pi-thons are all about?

1:39:56.246 --> 1:39:57.831
PI-THONS:
Yeah!

1:39:57.872 --> 1:39:59.290
(all hissing)

1:39:59.332 --> 1:40:01.167
Lou, you ready for this?

1:40:02.544 --> 1:40:04.379
Watch me.

1:40:05.714 --> 1:40:07.799
* *

1:40:10.385 --> 1:40:11.803
JUDGE:
This next answer will determine

1:40:11.845 --> 1:40:15.140
whether the Coolidge Pi-thons
win the Mathalon.

1:40:15.181 --> 1:40:16.433
Lou Gilbert.

1:40:16.474 --> 1:40:18.351
-Yes, Lou.
-Go, Lou!

1:40:18.393 --> 1:40:21.521
(Pi-Thons murmuring
encouragement, clapping)

1:40:23.064 --> 1:40:25.483
-Come on, Lou. -You got this.
-(encouragement continues)

1:40:26.860 --> 1:40:29.446
-Come on, Lou. You got this.
-PI-THON: Come on, Lou.

1:40:30.405 --> 1:40:33.908
A circle with perimeter eight pi
is inscribed in an ellipse

1:40:33.950 --> 1:40:35.493
whose width is twice its height.

1:40:35.535 --> 1:40:38.455
What is the area of the ellipse
in square units?

1:40:39.539 --> 1:40:41.499
(Pi-thons murmuring
encouragement)

1:40:41.541 --> 1:40:44.502
PI-THON: You know this.
Set your mind to it.

1:40:44.544 --> 1:40:46.463
NUMERATOR (whispers):
She's got it.

1:40:46.504 --> 1:40:48.256
-Yeah, she...
-(makes choking sounds)

1:40:48.298 --> 1:40:51.217
Anyone know a good choke?

1:40:51.259 --> 1:40:52.385
-Hey.
-JUDGE: Quiet, please.

1:40:52.427 --> 1:40:53.845
Please respect the Mathalonians.

1:40:53.887 --> 1:40:56.139
(laughter)

1:40:57.098 --> 1:40:58.767
GIRL:
It's not fair.

1:40:58.808 --> 1:41:00.018
BOY:
Loser!

1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:02.604
(laughter continues)

1:41:06.399 --> 1:41:08.193
(camera clicks)

1:41:08.234 --> 1:41:10.070
I tried to protect you
from this.

1:41:10.111 --> 1:41:12.405
-(spectators murmuring)
-Stop it.

1:41:12.447 --> 1:41:14.824
PI-THON:
Stay with us, Lou.

1:41:14.866 --> 1:41:16.368
(mouthing)

1:41:16.409 --> 1:41:17.660
(trembling breaths)

1:41:17.702 --> 1:41:20.413
PI-THON:
Don't let it get in your head!

1:41:20.455 --> 1:41:22.457
CHARLIE:
Lou.

1:41:29.005 --> 1:41:31.174
-What the hell is this?
-(cell phone chimes)

1:41:32.008 --> 1:41:33.802
Oh, my God.

1:41:43.269 --> 1:41:45.188
You guys, it's over here!

1:41:46.356 --> 1:41:47.816
BOY:
Dork!

1:41:47.857 --> 1:41:49.567
PI-THON:
Yeah, Mr. Gilbert. Good idea.

1:41:49.609 --> 1:41:51.236
PI-THON 2:
Yeah, that's it, Mr. Gilbert.

1:41:51.277 --> 1:41:52.737
CHARLIE:
Yeah. Yeah.

1:41:52.779 --> 1:41:54.739
-You got it.
-(Pi-thons murmuring)

1:41:55.824 --> 1:41:57.617
CHARLIE:
Come on!

1:42:05.667 --> 1:42:07.836
Come on. Objection.
He's counting.

1:42:07.877 --> 1:42:09.796
He's dancing, you lunatic.

1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:12.173
That's Kat Valdez.

1:42:12.215 --> 1:42:14.426
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna die.

1:42:15.218 --> 1:42:16.720
CHARLIE:
Come on. Come on.

1:42:16.761 --> 1:42:19.472
(Pi-thons murmuring
encouragement)

1:42:22.183 --> 1:42:24.227
PI-THON:
I believe in you!

1:42:28.189 --> 1:42:29.858
-32 pi!
-(buzzer sounds, bell dings)

1:42:31.526 --> 1:42:33.445
-The answer is correct.
-PI-THONS: Yes!

1:42:33.486 --> 1:42:35.196
But the timer's elapsed.

1:42:35.238 --> 1:42:37.365
The Trinity Numerators retain
their national status.

1:42:37.407 --> 1:42:38.950
-(cheering)
-We'll reconvene

1:42:38.992 --> 1:42:42.162
-in ten minutes for
the awards presentation. -Yeah!

1:42:42.203 --> 1:42:43.580
PI-THON:
Hey, it's okay, Lou.

1:42:43.621 --> 1:42:45.248
NUMERATORS (chanting):
Four years in a row!

1:42:45.290 --> 1:42:47.584
Four years in a row!
Four years in a row!

1:42:47.625 --> 1:42:48.877
Hey. Hey.

1:42:48.918 --> 1:42:51.004
I'm so proud of you.

1:42:51.046 --> 1:42:53.590
-(crying): Dad, I lost again.
-No, it doesn't matter.

1:42:53.631 --> 1:42:56.509
First of all, you got it right.
It was perfect.

1:42:56.551 --> 1:42:58.845
But second of all,
you were just up there.

1:42:58.887 --> 1:43:01.681
You stood up there,
and you were so brave.

1:43:02.515 --> 1:43:03.808
I'm the one who should be crying

1:43:03.850 --> 1:43:06.019
-for the dancing I was doing.
-(laughs)

1:43:06.061 --> 1:43:08.229
-You were great.
-(sobbing)

1:43:09.397 --> 1:43:11.316
Thank you.

1:43:12.650 --> 1:43:15.570
I love you, Dad. (sniffles)

1:43:15.612 --> 1:43:17.781
You were amazing, Lou.

1:43:17.822 --> 1:43:19.282
Really, I mean,

1:43:19.324 --> 1:43:21.659
you took a shot
even though it was scary.

1:43:23.119 --> 1:43:24.746
That's what matters.

1:43:28.083 --> 1:43:30.919
Not everything adds up
the way you think it will.

1:43:33.713 --> 1:43:37.384
You know, they say
if you want something different,

1:43:37.425 --> 1:43:39.844
you have to do
something different.

1:43:40.804 --> 1:43:43.306
What if we're just
too different?

1:43:43.348 --> 1:43:45.892
What if we're not?

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:01.241
(kids gasping, murmuring)

1:44:01.282 --> 1:44:03.034
(chuckles softly)

1:44:16.464 --> 1:44:18.883
(laughter)

1:44:19.884 --> 1:44:22.470
(mouthing)

1:44:23.680 --> 1:44:26.433
I'm fully blacking out
right now.

1:44:26.474 --> 1:44:29.602
-Come on, Mr. G.
-Come on, Mr. G!

1:44:29.644 --> 1:44:31.271
GIRL:
You're leaving her hanging.

1:44:31.312 --> 1:44:32.772
Come on, dude.

1:44:32.814 --> 1:44:34.357
Dad.

1:44:38.153 --> 1:44:41.322
CROWD:
Aw.

1:44:48.079 --> 1:44:50.331
KIDS:
Ew.

1:44:54.461 --> 1:44:56.671
CHARLIE:
Here we go.

1:44:58.048 --> 1:45:00.467
GLEE CLUB:
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

1:45:00.508 --> 1:45:02.802
* Marry me, marry me,

1:45:02.844 --> 1:45:04.846
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

1:45:04.888 --> 1:45:06.389
* For the rest, the rest... *

1:45:06.431 --> 1:45:08.016
KAT:
* I never seen forever *

1:45:08.058 --> 1:45:09.434
* Oh, yeah *

1:45:09.476 --> 1:45:11.102
* I never seen forever
in the wild *

1:45:11.144 --> 1:45:14.939
* But now I'm lookin',
now I'm lookin' in its eyes *

1:45:16.399 --> 1:45:18.109
* Baby, you're my shelter *

1:45:18.151 --> 1:45:20.070
* Shelter from
a broken paradise *

1:45:20.862 --> 1:45:22.322
* I couldn't dream it *

1:45:22.364 --> 1:45:25.367
* Any better if I tried *

1:45:26.534 --> 1:45:27.911
* True love gotta

1:45:27.952 --> 1:45:29.788

1:45:29.829 --> 1:45:31.456
-* Let 'em ring, ring, ring *
-* Ring, ring *

1:45:31.498 --> 1:45:33.333

1:45:38.505 --> 1:45:40.924
* Marry me, marry me,

1:45:40.965 --> 1:45:43.134
* Marry me, marry me, say yes *

1:45:43.176 --> 1:45:45.345
* For the rest,
the rest of your life *

1:45:45.387 --> 1:45:46.638
* Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma *

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.723
* Ma-Ma-Ma-Marry me *

1:45:48.765 --> 1:45:50.642
* Won't you love me, baby? *

1:45:50.684 --> 1:45:52.894
* Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma,
ma-ma-ma-marry me... *

1:45:52.936 --> 1:45:54.938
-Getting ready.
-Tanky.

1:45:54.979 --> 1:45:57.190
-This is the calm... Oh, gee!
-Oh, no!

1:45:57.232 --> 1:45:59.067
-Tank!
-(laughter)

1:45:59.109 --> 1:46:01.569
-Okay, wait. Slower.
-He doesn't have teeth.

1:46:01.611 --> 1:46:03.196
-Slower. Okay.
-He doesn't...

1:46:03.238 --> 1:46:06.282
* Diamonds and a necklace,
everything else is off *

1:46:06.324 --> 1:46:07.909
Good boy.

1:46:07.951 --> 1:46:09.953
* Now he wanna bet
he can beat me to the bed... *

1:46:09.994 --> 1:46:12.455
So, we met at Jimmy Fallon,
didn't we?

1:46:12.497 --> 1:46:13.915
-Yeah.
-We didn't hook up at Fallon.

1:46:13.957 --> 1:46:15.709
No, we had sex at Burning Man.

1:46:15.750 --> 1:46:16.960
So, Kat made me come
to one of those...

1:46:17.002 --> 1:46:18.461
Um, what are they
called again, babe?

1:46:18.503 --> 1:46:19.629
-It's called a Mathalon, bro.
-Yes!

1:46:19.671 --> 1:46:20.922
Oh, my God, it's so boring.

1:46:20.964 --> 1:46:22.424
And what do you guys
do there again?

1:46:22.465 --> 1:46:23.591
-It's this thing called, um...
-Math.

1:46:23.633 --> 1:46:25.051
-Yes! Oh, my God.
-Yep. Mm-hmm.

1:46:25.093 --> 1:46:26.469
I fell asleep just even
thinking about it, but...

1:46:26.511 --> 1:46:27.846
(laughing):
She did.

1:46:27.887 --> 1:46:30.473
-I-I met my most favorite
person here. -Mm.

1:46:30.515 --> 1:46:32.058
We met at a party
as she was leaving.

1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:33.560
And had I walked out
ten seconds earlier,

1:46:33.601 --> 1:46:35.061
we never would've met.

1:46:35.103 --> 1:46:36.730
And I bet you wish
that was the case sometimes.

1:46:36.771 --> 1:46:39.315
(laughs) Never.

1:46:39.357 --> 1:46:41.109
I had a six-mile radius set,

1:46:41.151 --> 1:46:43.653
and she definitely lived
more than six miles away.

1:46:43.695 --> 1:46:45.655
Well, she wanted
to meet at 4:00 p.m.

1:46:45.697 --> 1:46:47.574
Who meets at 4:00 p.m.?

1:46:47.615 --> 1:46:50.869
When we met,
he was in a unitard.

1:46:50.910 --> 1:46:52.620
She liked what she saw.

1:46:52.662 --> 1:46:54.080
(laughing)

1:46:54.122 --> 1:46:57.375
81 years ago, we were born
in the same hospital

1:46:57.417 --> 1:47:00.378
two days apart, in diapers.

1:47:00.420 --> 1:47:02.756
Here it is 81 years later,

1:47:02.797 --> 1:47:04.758
and we're back in diapers again.

1:47:04.799 --> 1:47:06.926
-Oh, Charlie!
-(both laugh)

1:47:06.968 --> 1:47:09.012
We met on a dating app,
but then,

1:47:09.054 --> 1:47:11.056
uh, he invited me
on the second date,

1:47:11.097 --> 1:47:13.350
um, camping in the woods,
and I was like,

1:47:13.391 --> 1:47:15.060
"That seems unsafe...

1:47:15.101 --> 1:47:17.062
-so I'll go."
-Her friend told her not to go.

1:47:17.103 --> 1:47:19.356
Yeah, but she did,
and it's been five years,

1:47:19.397 --> 1:47:20.940
and she's still alive.

1:47:20.982 --> 1:47:21.983
(both laugh)

1:47:22.025 --> 1:47:23.902
BOTH:
We met at a concert.

1:47:23.943 --> 1:47:25.653
* Spotlight on you
got me zoomin' *

1:47:25.695 --> 1:47:28.073
* I'm falling into you *

1:47:28.114 --> 1:47:30.825
* We're dancing on tabletops *

1:47:30.867 --> 1:47:33.244
* Neighbors calling the cops *

1:47:33.286 --> 1:47:35.580
* When I'm with you,
feels like *

1:47:35.622 --> 1:47:37.874
* Nobody's watching us *

1:47:37.916 --> 1:47:40.460
* We're burning down
all the clocks *

1:47:40.502 --> 1:47:42.837
* Hoping that time will stop *

1:47:42.879 --> 1:47:44.964
* Block out the world tonight *

1:47:45.006 --> 1:47:47.634
* Like nobody's watching us *

1:47:47.676 --> 1:47:49.552
* Nobody's watching us *

1:47:49.594 --> 1:47:51.805
* No, nobody's watching *

1:47:51.846 --> 1:47:53.973
* So come touch my body *

1:47:54.015 --> 1:47:56.851
* No, nobody's watching us *

1:47:56.893 --> 1:47:58.978
* Nobody's watching us *

1:47:59.020 --> 1:48:01.439
* No, nobody's watching *

1:48:01.481 --> 1:48:03.817
* So come touch my body *

1:48:03.858 --> 1:48:06.277
* No, nobody's watching us *

1:48:06.319 --> 1:48:08.321
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

1:48:08.363 --> 1:48:10.740
* Right here by the light
of the moon *

1:48:10.782 --> 1:48:13.702
* Spotlight on you
got me zoomin' *

1:48:13.743 --> 1:48:16.496
* I'm falling into you *

1:48:16.538 --> 1:48:18.832
* We're dancing on tabletops *

1:48:18.873 --> 1:48:21.334
* Neighbors calling the cops *

1:48:21.376 --> 1:48:23.795
* When I'm with you,
feels like *

1:48:23.837 --> 1:48:25.839
* Nobody's watching us *

1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:28.508
* We're burning down
all the clocks *

1:48:28.550 --> 1:48:30.844
* Hoping that time will stop *

1:48:30.885 --> 1:48:33.054
* Block out the world tonight *

1:48:33.096 --> 1:48:35.515
* Like nobody's watching us *

1:48:35.557 --> 1:48:37.559
* Nobody's watching us *

1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:39.811
* No, nobody's watching *

1:48:39.853 --> 1:48:42.105
* So come touch my body *

1:48:42.147 --> 1:48:44.190
* No, nobody's watching us *

1:48:44.232 --> 1:48:47.277
-* No, no, no, no, no *
-* No-no-no, no-no... *

1:48:47.318 --> 1:48:49.446
* No, nobody's watching *

1:48:49.487 --> 1:48:51.823
* So come touch my body *

1:48:51.865 --> 1:48:54.784
* No, nobody's watching us *

1:48:54.826 --> 1:48:57.454
-* Na, na, na. *
-(song ends)

1:48:57.495 --> 1:49:00.248
KAT: * Got ocean views
from ceiling to the floor *

1:49:00.290 --> 1:49:04.419
* Keep a milli by the bed,
a hundred more offshore-ore *

1:49:04.461 --> 1:49:07.255
* Closets full of Louis
and Christian Dior *

1:49:07.297 --> 1:49:10.925
* Picassos and van Goghs
that no one's seen before-ore *

1:49:10.967 --> 1:49:14.429
* Diamonds drippin' down
like fountains *

1:49:14.471 --> 1:49:17.557
* I'll sign, don't care
what the amount is *

1:49:17.599 --> 1:49:19.059
* Every day and night *

1:49:19.100 --> 1:49:21.102
* Live a life
filled with luxury *

1:49:21.144 --> 1:49:23.396
* Don't matter
when you're not with me *

1:49:23.438 --> 1:49:24.689
* Yeah, yeah *

1:49:24.731 --> 1:49:27.275

(Bastian singing in Spanish)

1:49:47.754 --> 1:49:51.091
(Kat and Bastian
singing in Spanish)

1:49:51.132 --> 1:49:52.967
KAT:
* Is this sentimental *

1:49:53.009 --> 1:49:54.636
* To put all my money
just right where my heart is? *

1:49:54.678 --> 1:49:56.137
* But, baby, you're special *

1:49:56.179 --> 1:49:57.972
* No matter the cost,
I'm-a do it regardless *

1:49:58.014 --> 1:50:01.101
* Let's take a jet, we're
riding out to Puerto Rico *

1:50:01.142 --> 1:50:04.270
* Later we get the yacht,
head to Santo Domingo *

1:50:04.312 --> 1:50:07.857
* And my body, papi,
es tu party *

1:50:07.899 --> 1:50:11.236
* Now I'm flying,

1:50:11.277 --> 1:50:14.823
* No questioning our love,
make my best days even better *

1:50:14.864 --> 1:50:17.784
* Long ain't long enough,
I'm looking at forever *

1:50:17.826 --> 1:50:21.246
* Diamonds drippin' down
like fountains *

1:50:21.287 --> 1:50:24.457
* I'll sign, don't care
what the amount is *
