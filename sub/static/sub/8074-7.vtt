WEBVTT

00:09.910 --> 00:12.446
Hey, busboy,
where have you been?

00:12.480 --> 00:15.716
If I wanted to cook and clean
and serve, I'd stay home.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.718
I was talking with my friends.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.254
Well, I don't want those
hoodlums hanging around here.

00:20.288 --> 00:23.324
They're scaring
away the truckers.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.693
I hate it here.
Why don't you just fire me?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.795
Because you're a tiny little
man and we're still hoping

00:27.828 --> 00:28.629
you might be magical.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.134
You know, Roseanne, if
he doesn't want to be here,

00:33.167 --> 00:34.768
we should just let him go.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.070
No way.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.671
I don't want him hanging
out with those hoodlums

00:37.705 --> 00:39.240
he's made friends with.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.974
I figure if they see
him in the apron,

00:41.008 --> 00:44.812
they'll go back to
wanting to beat him up.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.715
Well, that makes the
third bucket of lard

00:47.748 --> 00:50.218
that I have cleaned out
of this grease trap.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.153
I swear to god, Roseanne,
it's like cleaning

00:52.186 --> 00:55.489
out one of your arteries.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.525
Bitch, bitch, bitch,
that's all you ever are.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.562
Sorry.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.464
I just don't understand
how this thing can collect

01:03.497 --> 01:05.633
that much grease so fast.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.901
Would you shut up
about that thing?

01:07.935 --> 01:10.037
We all take our own turn
cleaning out, you know.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.210
I haven't cleaned that
grease trap out in over a year.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.946
Neither have I.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.148
Excuse me.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.351
That little boy just left
this note on my napkin.

01:23.384 --> 01:27.255
The big scary one
spits in the food.

01:27.288 --> 01:31.659
DJ, I think you should
apologize to the woman.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.328
You know, I'm real sorry my
mom does that to your food.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.802
Nice try, DJ, but I'm
still not going to fire you.

01:41.835 --> 01:46.440
And the joke is on you,
because I do spit in the food.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.410
Oh, that grease
trap is unspeakable.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.613
I have not felt this filthy
since my last confession.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.085
You know, you're the
only one who cleans that.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.453
Hey, DJ, break time.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.788
What?

02:00.821 --> 02:02.055
What did the boy say?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.123
I said, you're the only one--

02:03.157 --> 02:04.024
Don't listen to him.

02:04.057 --> 02:06.994
He's a hopeless alcoholic.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.797
My god, Roseanne, this is the
lowest thing you've ever done.

02:09.830 --> 02:10.898
No, it's not.

02:10.931 --> 02:11.799
You know the tip jar--

02:11.832 --> 02:12.700
That's it, DJ.

02:12.733 --> 02:13.934
You're fired.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.437
Thanks, mom.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.872
[theme music]

03:04.818 --> 03:08.055
Your black skirt with
the really long slit in it?

03:08.088 --> 03:11.024
I don't think it's
too revealing.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.326
OK.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.628
I'll come over at 7:00, then
we'll walk over together.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.096
All right.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.767
Don't forget, city's
got a leash law.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.768
That was no dog.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.337
That was Diana Longson.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.406
What the hell is she
going out with you for?

03:25.439 --> 03:28.242
Because I'm cute.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.643
No you're not.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.778
I am so.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.179
Ever since I broke
up with Darlene

03:32.212 --> 03:33.881
and became all
miserable, tons of girls

03:33.914 --> 03:35.316
have been flirting with me.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.419
They say I have the sad,
sensitive thing going.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.787
All right.

03:39.820 --> 03:43.824
They can feel sorry for you
when they're nailing real guys.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.394
Actually, I'm
jealous of you, Mark.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.829
I mean, I'll have to sleep
with dozens of women,

03:48.862 --> 03:51.365
sometimes two at a time,
while you have the security

03:51.399 --> 03:54.001
of sleeping with the same
woman every night til the day

03:54.034 --> 03:55.569
you die.

03:55.603 --> 03:58.439
Ha ha.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.108
Well, I'm glad you're
laughing, because I was worried

04:01.141 --> 04:02.776
that you'd be all
bummed out about Darlene

04:02.810 --> 04:06.013
moving in with that Jimmy
guy she's been seeing.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.081
You're lying.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.084
Wha-- wait, Becky didn't
tell you about that one?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.820
Whoops.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.622
They hardly know each other.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.357
Yeah, well, seeing each
other naked every day oughta

04:16.390 --> 04:19.126
change that.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.027
You know what?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.462
Those girls are right.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.163
You are cute when
you're miserable.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.035
George, that's Mark.

04:28.068 --> 04:28.969
Mark, scram.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.542
All right.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.477
I still can't believe
you got me tickets

04:36.510 --> 04:38.379
to Wrestlemania, Mrs. Conner.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.513
Thank you, so much.

04:39.547 --> 04:41.148
I mean, I really don't
know how to thank

04:41.181 --> 04:43.551
you enough other than
saying thank you,

04:43.584 --> 04:45.519
like I just did right now.
- Yeah, OK.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.620
Here's the thing.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.122
Yours is free, but for
reasons that you're

04:49.156 --> 04:51.792
too young to understand,
you need to sell

04:51.825 --> 04:55.028
DJ his ticket for 20 bucks.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.598
Where's DJ going to get $20?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.599
Well, I don't know.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.300
I guess he'll just
have to get a job.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.036
You should mention that to him.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.805
What if he doesn't
want to go with me?

05:04.838 --> 05:07.541
You know, I don't think
DJ likes me very much.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.176
Well, that's just because
you're really boring.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.412
But the tickets will
change everything.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.312
Hey, DJ.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.715
Look who's here.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.784
Get rid of him.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.251
Now DJ, that's not very nice.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.488
George has something to ask you.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.791
OK, go ahead, and keep it short.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.593
Um, DJ?

05:25.626 --> 05:27.327
Do you want to go to
Wrestlemania with me?

05:27.361 --> 05:30.097
I got these tickets.
- Really?

05:30.130 --> 05:31.365
Yeah.

05:31.399 --> 05:34.902
Now the thing of it is,
you've got to pay me $20.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.805
Or if you don't have a twenty,
you could pay me two tens,

05:37.838 --> 05:40.408
or a ten and two fives, or
four fives, which I prefer

05:40.441 --> 05:41.642
because you know
I'm collecting them,

05:41.675 --> 05:43.343
you know because I like Lincoln.

05:43.377 --> 05:46.780
Hey wow, DJ, tickets to
the hottest event in town.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.248
Too bad you're broke.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.149
I'm not broke.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.184
Come on, I'll get my money.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.720
Well, you're not
supposed to have any money.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.221
You're unemployed.

05:54.254 --> 05:55.122
Huh.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.890
I don't need your stinking job.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.258
I get an allowance from dad.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.636
Freeze.

06:08.669 --> 06:13.574
I was just going to get
you something to hit me with.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.576
You can't go just
giving him money, Dan.

06:15.609 --> 06:16.877
I want him to learn
responsibility

06:16.910 --> 06:18.045
by working at the diner.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.212
Well, he's 13 years old.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.415
He's got plenty of time
to learn responsibility.

06:21.449 --> 06:22.816
That is so wrong, Dan.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.218
He is at a crossroads
of his life

06:25.252 --> 06:30.424
where he can either become
a total loser or a busboy.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.426
Roseanne, none of his
friends have to work.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.761
Well, they will.

06:33.794 --> 06:36.530
Them license plates don't just
make themselves, you know.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.298
All right.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.001
From now on, no more allowance.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.803
I'll just tell him
we went broke again.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.172
Yeah, well you got to get
back the money you gave him.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.073
I can't do that.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.374
He'll hate me.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
Well, Dan, if he hates
you because you take back

06:49.443 --> 06:51.311
your money, then he wasn't
that good of a friend

06:51.344 --> 06:53.514
in the first place, was he?

06:53.547 --> 06:55.415
See ya.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.950
DJ, wait a minute.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.253
I've been thinking,
and I've decided

07:00.287 --> 07:04.958
it's not right for you to get
money without working for it.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.760
So I want you to give
me your allowance back.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.228
Gee, Dan, that's not fair.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.002
Well, I don't have it anymore.
I gave it to George.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.904
Well then, you just have
to give me your ticket.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.006
Now.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.340
Sorry, DJ.

07:20.373 --> 07:22.175
You know if it was up to me,
I'd let you go in a second.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.648
Fine.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.217
Now it is up to you.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.451
Uh, no, Dan.

07:31.485 --> 07:32.352
Remember?

07:32.385 --> 07:33.954
Love, honor, and obey.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.789
I'm forced to go along with you.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.024
Oh, honey.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.159
Just this once I think
we'll let you be in charge.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.796
All right.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.764
Here you go.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.332
Have a good time.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.536
Your dad and I will just be
here waiting for you alone,

07:48.569 --> 07:51.438
together, with no witnesses.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.606
Guys, wait up.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.348
Well, it's almost 2:00.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.917
I've got to run.

08:03.951 --> 08:04.852
Oh, I got it, Darlene.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.753
Coffee's on me.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.687
Oh, I know.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.721
I was just getting
a piece of gum.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.592
See you later.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.305
Hey, can I bum a stick?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.139
Um, sure.

08:29.943 --> 08:30.744
Thanks.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.084
Is this seat taken?

08:37.117 --> 08:39.186
It's all yours.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.088
You're Jimmy Gertner, right?

08:41.121 --> 08:41.989
Yeah.

08:42.022 --> 08:42.956
Have we met?

08:42.990 --> 08:43.857
No.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.593
I'm Craig Shapiro.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.698
You go out with that
Darlene Conner, right?

08:50.731 --> 08:51.599
Yeah.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.700
You know Darlene?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.101
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.335
She's great.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.270
Did you guys meet in her
writing class or something?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.305
No.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.608
Actually, we met at
my dance recital.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.443
Really?

09:03.476 --> 09:05.278
So you're like a dancer?

09:05.312 --> 09:09.082
Like a ballet dancer?

09:09.116 --> 09:09.983
Yeah.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.184
Ballet, jazz, tap.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.085
Tap?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.487
Tap's cool.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.156
Are you like the only
guy in the class?

09:16.189 --> 09:20.761
Are there other guys
like you in the class?

09:20.794 --> 09:23.196
Actually, my boxing coach
had me take ballet to help me

09:23.230 --> 09:25.999
with my footwork.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.468
Boxing.

09:28.501 --> 09:32.339
You mean like hitting?

09:32.372 --> 09:34.107
How do you know Darlene?

09:34.141 --> 09:35.843
I've known her for a while.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.712
She's a very, very special girl.

09:38.746 --> 09:44.217
Just happy to know
that she's better.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.118
Better?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.319
What do you mean?

09:46.353 --> 09:48.121
Nothing.
Nothing.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.222
I can't talk about it.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.325
You know, with
break of confidence.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
What confidence?

09:53.861 --> 09:59.299
Well, see, I'm a
peer counselor, and--

09:59.332 --> 10:00.768
never mind.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.470
Darlene went to
a peer counselor?

10:03.503 --> 10:04.672
Why?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.007
Hey, I can't divulge
that information.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.142
There's a little thing
called confidential-est-ness.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.083
So are you guys serious?

10:16.116 --> 10:17.150
Yeah.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.752
We're thinking about
moving in together.

10:18.786 --> 10:19.586
Wow.

10:21.955 --> 10:22.823
What?

10:22.856 --> 10:23.924
Bad idea?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.025
No, no.

10:25.058 --> 10:30.297
I just never thought
she'd try that again.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.266
Wow.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.268
Listen, I'm sorry I can't
talk to you about Darlene.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.705
But you know, if you want
to talk about your feelings.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.578
Actually, this moving in thing
together, it's a little scary,

10:45.612 --> 10:46.479
you know?

10:46.513 --> 10:47.380
Yeah.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.983
Yes, it can be.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.685
You don't think it's
a good idea, do you?

10:51.719 --> 10:53.586
Oh, quite the opposite.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.323
I think it will be a
great test for Darlene.

10:56.356 --> 11:00.593
And for you, well, what doesn't
kill us only makes us stronger.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.746
Hey DJ, you have enough
room in those pants there?

11:18.779 --> 11:21.448
Don't tell me, you're
the back of the horse.

11:21.481 --> 11:22.950
They're mine.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.417
Dad bought them for me.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.518
Well, isn't that sweet?

11:25.552 --> 11:27.487
Today my little boy is a crip.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.822
No.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.590
He just wants to look good
for his first day on the job.

11:30.623 --> 11:31.691
Really?

11:31.725 --> 11:33.393
You mean he's ready
to come back to work?

11:33.426 --> 11:34.728
Oh Dan, tonight, no foreplay.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.466
Well, he's going
to be learning

11:39.499 --> 11:42.102
all about responsibility.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.204
Yup, just like you wanted.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.373
He's coming to work
with me at the garage.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.207
Isn't that great?

11:52.079 --> 11:53.680
You're so delighted,
you could barely speak.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.820
You rewarded me by
making Sloppy Joe's.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.727
And then now you're going to put
on something frilly for dinner.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.636
What's wrong?

12:16.669 --> 12:18.972
He won't be hanging
out with those thugs.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.241
Why do you get so
bent out of shape?

12:21.274 --> 12:23.043
Let's just drop it, Dan.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.245
He is working for
you and that is that.

12:25.278 --> 12:30.017
And I hope the two of you have
a very happy time together.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.852
Wait a minute.
Are you jealous?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.787
Don't be ridiculous.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.923
You're upset because
he's spending time with me?

12:35.956 --> 12:36.756
No.

12:39.359 --> 12:43.363
I'm upset because he's not
spending any time with me.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.999
Oh, honey.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.501
I thought you were worried
about him becoming a delinquent.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.536
Oh please, Dan.

12:49.569 --> 12:51.839
I think you know me
better than that.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.441
He can mug old ladies
for all I care.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.076
As long as he comes home
at the end of the day

12:56.109 --> 12:59.412
and tells me how it went.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.848
He loves you, honey.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.515
Everybody loves me, Dan.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.884
We're not talking about love.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.118
We're talking about time.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.222
We used to do things together.

13:09.256 --> 13:13.493
You know, I'd cut his hair
and we'd bake M&M cookies

13:13.526 --> 13:17.464
and we'd send pizzas
over to the convent.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.966
You know, mother-son
type things.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.670
13-year-old boy doesn't
have much in common

13:23.703 --> 13:26.773
with a 42-year-old woman.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.709
Actually, if he did,
we'd be worried.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.145
Yeah, but he still likes you.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.848
You get to be the buddy and
I'm stuck being the mom.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.016
Oh, it's just a phase.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.585
You'll have back in a few years.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.288
Oh yeah, well, after
a few years with you,

13:41.321 --> 13:42.655
I ain't going to want him back.

13:52.732 --> 13:53.600
Hey, Jimmy.

13:53.633 --> 13:54.968
Funny running into you here.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.203
Yeah.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.605
Just like the library
yesterday and the cafeteria

13:58.638 --> 14:00.540
and the bowling alley.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.410
It's amazing we just keep
bumping into each other.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.677
Yeah.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.513
Well listen, I hope we can
talk about something other

14:06.546 --> 14:09.082
than Darlene this time,
because last time I

14:09.116 --> 14:11.284
was pretty uncomfortable.

14:11.318 --> 14:14.287
Don't worry about it.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.256
So how's that
whole thing going?

14:16.289 --> 14:17.124
Stop.

14:17.157 --> 14:18.225
What?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.160
Look, I went to that
peer counseling office.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.494
They've never heard of you.

14:21.528 --> 14:26.633
Well, that's because I do
a lot of work undercover.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.635
Cut the crap.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.904
Look, I know you want to
break me and Darlene up.

14:30.938 --> 14:31.939
I do not.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.974
Yes you do, and I know why.

14:34.007 --> 14:34.975
I know your whole story, man.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.913
I'm sorry.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
I was just desperate.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.350
Why did you have to come onto
me if you knew I was straight?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.693
What?

14:53.726 --> 14:54.627
You think I'm gay?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.529
What would make
you think I'm gay?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.730
Come on, Craig.

14:57.764 --> 15:00.733
It was pretty obvious
the first time I met you.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.369
What made it obvious?

15:02.402 --> 15:03.336
A lot of things.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.204
A lot of things like what?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.908
Well, for one, you told
me you were an artist.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.312
Well, you're a ballet
dancer for God's sakes.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.715
You ever had your butt
kicked by a ballet dancer?

15:15.748 --> 15:17.284
What are you doing here?

15:17.317 --> 15:18.185
Wait a minute.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.087
You do know Craig?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.254
This is Craig?

15:21.288 --> 15:23.890
The gay guy that's
been hitting on you?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.858
I am not gay.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.295
- I want some answers.
- No, me first.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.696
Come here.
- Wait a minute.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.730
I want to hear this.

15:30.763 --> 15:31.965
Sit down.

15:31.999 --> 15:32.865
Not you.

15:32.899 --> 15:33.967
Come here.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.168
What the hell are
you doing here?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.369
I don't know.

15:36.403 --> 15:38.138
When I heard that you guys
might move in together,

15:38.171 --> 15:39.606
I felt like I had
to do something.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.243
So you told my boyfriend you
were a gay guy named Craig?

15:43.276 --> 15:44.144
No.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.245
I didn't tell him I was gay.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.213
He could just tell.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.148
I mean, no.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.549
You know what I mean.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.019
Dave, why are you
messing with my life?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.586
I just didn't want
you to move in with him.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.056
I want you to stop it.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.324
I can't even look at you.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.692
This is like the most pathetic
thing you've ever done.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.628
Is not.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.496
Wait a minute, pal.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.166
If you weren't after me,
why were you trying to break

16:06.199 --> 16:07.267
me and my girlfriend up?

16:11.238 --> 16:15.742
See-- wow, who's he?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.657
I'm kinda nervous.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.525
I've never had a job
interview before.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.294
I got all my other jobs
when I was just walking by.

16:37.697 --> 16:42.135
So tell us, Miss
Fleigler, why the Lunchbox?

16:42.169 --> 16:45.372
Why busperson.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.374
Until my boyfriend's
band gets a record deal,

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
he thought I should work.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.611
Because, you know, he's
never had a job before.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.980
And they say all the
good ones are taken.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.748
I know.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.150
I'm really lucky.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.087
He says when he gets famous,
he's going to take care of me.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.988
Well, that is the good
thing about rock stars.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.058
They're so loyal.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.061
Uh, Miss Fleigler,
this position

17:08.095 --> 17:11.931
requires someone
with experience.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.968
Have you done anything prior
to this in the bussing field?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.808
I think I can handle it.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.310
OK, Stacey.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.745
Mrs. Conner and I always
like to discuss the applicant

17:25.778 --> 17:28.014
before we reach a decision.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.016
If you will excuse
us for one minute,

17:30.049 --> 17:36.889
we will retire to the area
that we like to call--

17:36.923 --> 17:40.360
those cannot be real.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.361
Think about it, Jackie.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.996
She'd be really
great for business.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.832
How do you figure?

17:45.865 --> 17:46.799
Wake up, Jackie.

17:46.833 --> 17:47.967
Even I'm getting a woody.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.775
Hey.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.644
What do you want?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.180
Mom, I want my job back.
Please.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.349
I mean, I just hated
working at the garage.

18:02.382 --> 18:06.319
All I did was move
heavy boxes, so I quit.

18:06.353 --> 18:10.790
Well, DJ, I
don't know if I can

18:10.823 --> 18:14.026
take you back, because we've
already filled the position.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.563
Congratulations,
Stacey, you got the job.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.497
Cool.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.166
Hey, when does my
insurance start?

18:19.199 --> 18:19.999
Because I need some shots.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.338
That's not fair.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.674
I just quit the garage.
- Well, I don't know.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.643
Maybe we could use two
buspersons around here.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.112
But I really don't
know if I should

18:33.146 --> 18:36.749
hire you back after the way you
were acting around here, DJ.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.986
I think at least you
owe me an apology.

18:40.019 --> 18:40.820
I'm sorry.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.593
Tell me you love me.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
What?

18:48.461 --> 18:51.063
Tell me you love me or no job.

18:51.097 --> 18:51.964
All right.

18:51.998 --> 18:52.932
I love you.

18:52.965 --> 18:53.766
Jeez.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.270
Great.
That's wonderful.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.171
OK.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.240
Welcome back.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.776
Well, do you think tonight
you could go to a movie with me?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.111
Yeah, sure.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.514
But you know, DJ, I
don't approve of movies

19:07.547 --> 19:09.416
with sex and violence in them.

19:09.449 --> 19:13.420
So you'll just have to
pick one or the other.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.787
OK.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.622
OK.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.760
You get your job back?

19:20.793 --> 19:22.462
Yeah.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.063
You ask your mom to
take you to the movies?

19:24.096 --> 19:26.433
- Yeah.
- Good work.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.901
Well, how about at the movie
I have to buy some popcorn?

19:33.506 --> 19:36.476
Nice touch.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.945
You know, DJ, you're really
doing a good thing for your mom

19:38.978 --> 19:40.247
here.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.382
One day, you're going to be
really glad you came back.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.850
I'm already glad.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.084
You see the new busboy?

20:07.274 --> 20:08.941
You know, Stacey,
things have sure

20:08.975 --> 20:13.380
changed around here ever since
you started working at the Box.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.548
Have they ever.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.949
What do you mean?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.087
Hello.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.523
Some sailors told me this
was the place to come

20:23.556 --> 20:26.626
for a loose meat sandwich.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.929
My, you're certainly
an attractive man.

20:29.962 --> 20:30.997
Too bad I'm married.

20:31.030 --> 20:35.468
Oh wait, I forgot
I'm a huge slut.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.337
I've always been a nice girl.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.106
I wish someone could
teach me to be bad.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.779
Oops.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.350
I got whipped cream
on your shirt.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.353
Let me clean that up for you.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.721
Yeah.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.257
And you know, this belt doesn't
really go with these pants.

21:00.960 --> 21:06.198
Would you like to hear about
our three for one special?

21:06.232 --> 21:08.067
How would you like
to get all hot and

21:08.100 --> 21:10.169
sweaty and gooey and slippery?

21:27.053 --> 21:30.289
Man, don't you guys
ever clean this thing?
