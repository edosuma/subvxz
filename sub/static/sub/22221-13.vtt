WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:06.709
No! No! I will not be a
slave to your hormones.
-Aeryn, no! Aeryn, wait!

00:06.799 --> 00:10.257
Two drops of this nectar and
we can tell if our DNA's
compatible.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.720
Please?

00:14.265 --> 00:16.256
Tyno:
You kissed our Princess.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.135
What does that mean?

00:17.226 --> 00:19.558
I want you to consider
marrying her.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.260
( both yelling rapturously)

00:21.355 --> 00:25.268
You will rule not because
you desire it, Clavor,

00:25.359 --> 00:28.522
but because I do.

00:28.613 --> 00:31.525
Jena:
If you're not going to
be king, Clavor, I'm not going to marry you.

00:31.616 --> 00:33.072
Zhaan:
What is it, Pilot?

00:33.159 --> 00:35.400
The Builders.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.280
Her creators.

00:37.371 --> 00:41.410
After we're married, and I mean,
right after we're married, they
turn us into statues.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.240
Oh, hello Crichton.

00:43.336 --> 00:47.295
My daughter or that abomination.
Choose.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.588
There's never been anything we
couldn't overcome together.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.131
Except each other.

00:51.219 --> 00:55.053
Here's your wedding present
from Prince Clavor.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.219
( screaming )

00:59.477 --> 01:03.265
Jenavian Chatto, Disruptor,
Peacekeeper Special
Directorate.

01:03.356 --> 01:04.721
So, what's your assignment?

01:04.815 --> 01:08.057
Stay close to Prince Clavor,
my vapid little fiancee,

01:08.152 --> 01:10.108
and if he assumes the
crown, kill him.

01:10.196 --> 01:16.066
I sense unhappiness, that your
friend Crichton is marrying
our Princess.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.991
Oh, yes? And why would
that make me unhappy?

01:18.079 --> 01:20.195
Kahaynu:
Moya can reproduce gunships.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.904
Moya must be decommissioned.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.490
She is killing herself because
her deity commanded it.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.450
A little reunion is in order,
don't you think?

01:26.545 --> 01:30.333
Crichton:
I've had three near death
experiences in one day.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.039
You can't just quit.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.295
I'm not quitting.

01:34.387 --> 01:35.797
Ijust can't go on.

01:35.888 --> 01:41.724
She is gone, and I am
shortly to follow.

01:41.811 --> 01:45.144
This is what our child
would look like?

01:45.231 --> 01:46.641
One possibility.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.142
The choice is ours.

01:48.234 --> 01:52.102
l'm exploring the Barren Lands.
If you think you can keep up.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.902
( chuckles )

01:53.990 --> 01:56.106
Do you accept this burden
in matrimony?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.815
Without hesitation.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.655
lt's calibrated only
for Sebaceans.

02:00.746 --> 02:04.989
Endure the pain and
rule wisely.

02:05.084 --> 02:05.869
Wool

02:05.960 --> 02:09.248
( screaming )

02:12.383 --> 02:15.125
Chiana:
Tonight on Farscape.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.552
D'Argo:
They look so...

02:18.639 --> 02:20.220
Chiana:
Stiff.

02:20.308 --> 02:23.345
Rygel:
I think he should have taken
his pose more seriously.

02:23.436 --> 02:25.142
Tyno:
I believe he did the
best he could.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.389
D'Argo:
So, what happens now?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.096
For them, 80 cycles
of government.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.352
Boring, but ultimately
advantageous.

02:31.444 --> 02:33.025
And what do we do?

02:33.112 --> 02:36.320
Scorpius has been asked to leave
our system within the solar day.

02:36.407 --> 02:38.318
Once his Command Carrier
vacates...

02:38.409 --> 02:40.616
We hope that Moya returns
and picks us up.

02:40.703 --> 02:42.318
Chiana:
You really going to stay, Ryg?

02:42.413 --> 02:47.203
Why not? Crichton will
need advising and ah,
the food's good.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.703
So he can hear us?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.295
Every word.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.212
The acoustics of this chamber
funnel all sounds to them.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.540
May we say goodbye?

02:55.634 --> 02:57.465
I'll wait outside.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.056
John.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.303
Hey, D'Argo.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.101
You can hear us, but do
you feel any pain?

03:08.189 --> 03:10.646
No, but I'd really love
to pick my nose.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.146
He remains without a
sense of humor.

03:14.236 --> 03:15.692
It's good to hear your
voice, John.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.272
Yours, too. Hey, can I
say hi to Chiana?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.573
Chiana.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.115
You look great in bronze.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.697
You look great in pink.

03:27.792 --> 03:29.123
Brings out your eyes.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.791
( laughs )

03:33.172 --> 03:36.289
Clavor:
Frelll Frelll Frelll

03:36.384 --> 03:38.841
I'm gonna topple his statue!

03:38.928 --> 03:41.761
I should be regent!

03:41.847 --> 03:43.428
(metallic clank)
(gasps )

03:43.516 --> 03:46.223
Cargn:
While enormously symbolic,
Your Highness,

03:46.310 --> 03:49.268
may I propose a more
permanent tactic?

03:49.355 --> 03:49.889
What?!

03:49.980 --> 03:51.516
( growls )

03:53.401 --> 03:54.766
(gasps )

03:58.030 --> 04:00.487
Cargn:
Are you sure he's still alive?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.737
Clavor:
Of course. Each cell is
self-encapsulated.

04:03.828 --> 04:08.572
As long as the parts stay in
their metallised state, he can
be reconstituted.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.122
Cargn:
Very impressive.

04:10.209 --> 04:13.246
My great grandfather was broken
in half when the senate
coHapsed

04:13.337 --> 04:14.918
after a groundshaker.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.996
All he suffered was
a severe limp.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.331
( laughs )

04:18.426 --> 04:22.544
Foundry acid should ensure
this ruler fares worse.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.300
No, no, no, no, give it to me.
Give it to me.

04:30.312 --> 04:35.852
I know you can hear me,
Crichton, and I know
you're scared.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.310
Our laws state that a couple
must rule together, hmm?

04:39.405 --> 04:46.322
That's why the crown must soon
pass to me because you can't
rule with one little head.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.877
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.131
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.133
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

05:07.224 --> 05:10.557
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.394
Help me.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.935
Listen, please.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.853
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

05:14.940 --> 05:19.183
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.439
I'm doing everything I can.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.363
I'm just looking for a way
home.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.419
Aeryn:
I propose that we start here
and traverse around.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.050
Excellent.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.596
You always this agreeable?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.344
( chuckles )

05:51.435 --> 05:54.552
Am I being agreeable?

05:54.647 --> 06:01.394
Well, everything I've suggested,
since the moment we met,
you've consented to.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.066
They've all been good ideas.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.364
And your proficiency at this is?

06:07.451 --> 06:10.363
I've been rated expert.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.194
Really?

06:16.168 --> 06:18.204
Mmm. That's clearly
a local custom.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.162
What's this one called?
"Kiss your climbing partner"?

06:21.257 --> 06:23.213
A different local custom.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.336
"Kiss woman you're
attracted to."

06:25.427 --> 06:26.132
Right.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.801
You ready?

06:31.267 --> 06:35.010
Novia:
Whoever perpetrated this
atrocity shall pay in kind. Beheaded!

06:35.104 --> 06:37.345
D'Argo:
Surely you don't think...
-Silence!

06:37.439 --> 06:41.523
This planet is under stringent
law until my daughter's husband
is made whole.

06:41.610 --> 06:45.102
No one is to leave or even
contact their vessels,

06:45.197 --> 06:48.940
whether they purport to be a
friend of the crown or not!

06:50.744 --> 06:52.245
Mm... mm...

06:52.329 --> 06:55.492
Where is the one called Aeryn
Sun? The former Peacekeeper?

06:55.583 --> 06:57.119
Rygel:
We don't know.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.951
She was upset that Crichton
was to marry the Princess.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.421
I saw it with my own eyes.

07:01.505 --> 07:04.417
You cannot possibly think...
-I can't possibly not!

07:05.676 --> 07:07.212
Find her.

07:07.303 --> 07:09.635
Bring her to us for questioning.

07:09.722 --> 07:13.556
If you want someone with a
motive for stealing
Crichton's head,

07:13.642 --> 07:16.258
try that vigilar Scorpius.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.890
Everyone is suspect, especially
off-worlders.

07:18.981 --> 07:23.691
If Prince Clavor assumes the
throne, I cannot guarantee
your safety.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.981
Find your friend's head.

07:40.502 --> 07:45.337
Very fortunate I sampled
your DNA when you were
in the Aurora Chair.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.211
There would have been no other
way to track you, Crichton.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.382
Though the crystalisation of
your cells was designed
to withstand

07:52.473 --> 07:59.185
80 cycles of airborne
corrosives, it seems
three arns, well,

07:59.271 --> 08:01.136
a full-on acid attack is
all it takes.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.143
You're beginning to pit.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.362
And while I won't be able
to retrieve your body,

08:08.405 --> 08:10.191
I promise you,

08:10.282 --> 08:13.365
the wormhole calculations
you have in your mind...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.412
Who's there?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.499
Who's there?

08:33.555 --> 08:35.341
(grunts)

08:36.225 --> 08:37.886
(DRD whirring)

08:42.356 --> 08:47.316
You should use one of Moya's
Transport Pods instead
of that little one.

08:48.404 --> 08:49.940
What do you care what I do?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.022
All life is precious.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.278
Yours should continue.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.905
And Moya's shouldn't?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.121
We have been through this.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.948
Moya can produce
gunship offspring.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.126
We did not intend the universe
to be subjected to that
affliction.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.919
I'm sorry.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.122
I must leave now.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.424
No! Kahaynu!

09:12.511 --> 09:16.550
If Moya's life is to end
capriciously, and Pilot's also,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.972
you and l are going to
remain with them.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.344
Doubtful.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.930
DRD, now!

09:26.024 --> 09:27.434
In reverse!

09:28.694 --> 09:32.027
Kahaynu:
What? Stop this!

09:32.114 --> 09:33.945
Recommission Moya.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.160
I cannot. I will not.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.485
Turn the engine off!

09:40.914 --> 09:45.283
I will spare you if
you spare Moya.

09:45.377 --> 09:47.242
Stop! I beg you!

09:47.337 --> 09:51.421
How does it feel for your
prayers to go unanswered,
Kahaynu?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.924
( Kahaynu screams )

10:00.809 --> 10:02.185
Dear goddess.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.102
In my rage, what have I done?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.233
I cannot find Crichton's
head anywhere.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.233
I feel miserable.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.783
Hey...

10:20.704 --> 10:22.990
Aren't you tired?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.208
Just responsible.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.783
I'm the one that talked
him into it.

10:29.171 --> 10:32.663
We had no other options.
You said that yourself.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.220
We take what we get.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.345
( loud screaming )

10:44.436 --> 10:45.937
My body! My body!

10:46.021 --> 10:47.056
I'm working on it.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.229
Working on it? It's impossible.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.772
Strangely not.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.726
If I do this right, your
current state is not terminal.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.686
And if not done right?

10:55.781 --> 10:57.112
Terminal.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.279
Get experts.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.323
We're beyond that,
don't you think?

11:00.410 --> 11:04.323
You're way too vulnerable
in this state.
See exhibits "A" and "l3."

11:04.414 --> 11:06.154
Have you got a plan?

11:06.250 --> 11:07.285
Revitalize you.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.332
Your speech abilities are
so limited right now,

11:09.419 --> 11:12.206
you couldn't convince the
Empress you're a
headless statue.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.333
Whoa, nice dress.
-Save it.

11:14.424 --> 11:19.544
When the Empress sees you, my
trill fiance and his Scarran
will be in deep dren.

11:19.638 --> 11:22.175
Then you can be remade
into a statue.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.881
That's not much of a plan.

11:23.976 --> 11:27.218
As long as the parts
are aligned right...
(grunts in pain)

11:27.312 --> 11:29.303
the machine should do the rest.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, hey, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

11:31.775 --> 11:33.982
Just a second! Hey, come back!

11:35.070 --> 11:37.311
(electronic whirring )

11:42.536 --> 11:44.447
(groaning)

11:45.998 --> 11:48.330
Can you turn your neck?

11:48.417 --> 11:50.499
(groaning)

11:53.755 --> 11:55.165
Can you speak?

11:55.632 --> 11:57.293
Thank you.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.375
Can you walk?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.381
Uh... uh...

12:02.848 --> 12:04.213
( groans )

12:04.308 --> 12:06.014
( frustrated sigh )

12:06.101 --> 12:08.387
Cargn:
I told you, it's best we're
not seen together

12:08.478 --> 12:09.888
until after you're married

12:09.980 --> 12:11.436
and assume the line
of succession!

12:11.523 --> 12:14.105
You mean, if I do.
Crichton's body is gone.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.932
Someone used the processor
to revitalize him.

12:16.028 --> 12:18.644
Without his head, is that
really a concern?

12:18.739 --> 12:22.106
They're still reconstructing
the data but it seems, oh,
great frell up,

12:22.200 --> 12:24.282
that his head was attached at
the time!

12:24.369 --> 12:27.327
Someone retrieved his head?

12:27.414 --> 12:32.499
Do something, oh magnificent
representative of a
supposedly master race

12:32.586 --> 12:36.249
or you will surely die at
my mother's hand.

12:36.340 --> 12:39.423
And I, I will cheer her on.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.342
Aeryn:
Dregon, what's wrong?

12:46.433 --> 12:47.297
Nothing.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.678
I've secured it.
You can come up now.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.977
Are your lines stuck?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.974
I'm coming down.
-|t's okay.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.270
Dregon?
-l'm... just...

13:03.909 --> 13:05.194
Are you injured?

13:05.285 --> 13:06.149
We're too high.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.529
What?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.243
Aeryn:
You've done this before,
haven't you?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.920
Isn't that right?
You were rated expert, correct?

13:20.384 --> 13:22.545
At the training facility.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.172
This is your first wall?

13:24.262 --> 13:26.173
Yeah. Outside.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.129
For the love of Cholak!

13:28.225 --> 13:30.591
All right. Hang on.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.855
Right. Grab my hand.

13:40.946 --> 13:43.062
Dregon, just grab my hand.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.152
Good. Good.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.158
All right... no...
-Help me.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.114
Please. Don't let me fall.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.995
lwon't. It's fine.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.745
That left hand.
Can you do that?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.330
You got it? Take a deep...

14:01.425 --> 14:03.211
Take a deep breath!

14:03.301 --> 14:05.587
Take a deep breath...

14:05.679 --> 14:06.668
That's it.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.048
All right, now, hold on.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.176
I've got you.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.259
No, no, no, no, no, not my leg.
The wall! Hold on to the wall!

14:13.353 --> 14:15.014
Aah!

14:19.693 --> 14:21.183
Crichton:
Where the hell are we?

14:21.278 --> 14:23.519
Don't worry about it.
Somewhere no one will find you.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.319
That was not my question.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.271
( Crichton grunts )

14:26.366 --> 14:27.822
(grunting):
Ouch.

14:27.909 --> 14:28.694
Is that your real name?

14:28.785 --> 14:31.071
John Crichton?
-Yeah.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.116
And which Sebacean house
is that from?

14:34.207 --> 14:37.745
Hey now, if I tell you,
I'll have to kill you.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.503
Why is Scorpius here?

14:43.133 --> 14:44.293
You don't know?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.215
He's not part of my brief.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.294
However, he seems to be
part of yours.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.472
Look, I appreciate that
you have questions.

14:52.559 --> 14:55.676
I'm sure you'll appreciate that
I'm not going to answer them.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.306
(grunts)

14:57.397 --> 14:59.228
I heard some of what
Scorpius said.

14:59.316 --> 15:03.525
He wasn't protecting you as
an ally. He was capturing
you as prey.

15:09.367 --> 15:12.234
You wouldn't like the truth.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.821
The data scan listed John
Crichton as non-Sebacean.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.658
So, if you're not Sebacean,
you're not Peacekeeper.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.539
If you're not Peacekeeper,
you're not Special Directorate.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.373
If you're not Special
Directorate, you can't
be a Disruptor.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.751
And if you're not a Disruptor,

15:30.180 --> 15:32.717
then you know too much about me.

15:33.809 --> 15:36.095
Oh.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.849
Well, there's more, but that
pretty much sums it up, yeah.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.977
That is either the most pathetic
fabrication I've ever heard,

15:43.068 --> 15:45.059
or the most pathetic life
I could ever imagine.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.485
Either way...
-Oh, like they're whacked
out antecedents

15:47.572 --> 15:50.359
to a chick with a stiletto
in her wrist?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.329
Better.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.285
So did you kill Scorpy?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.996
Leave bodies lying around,
they look for a killer.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.127
It's not like he's going to
report the assault.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.708
Then why choose me over him?

16:09.803 --> 16:13.170
Because I couldn't give a krag's
ass about anything but my job.

16:13.265 --> 16:17.850
Prevent the Scarrans from
getting a claw on this empire.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.222
You're my best chance of
making that happen.

16:20.313 --> 16:24.147
Assuming I'm willing to play
garden gnome for the
next 80 cycles.

16:28.363 --> 16:32.072
John, if I fail,

16:33.160 --> 16:35.617
so many innocent lives
will be lost.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.579
Help me do myjob

16:39.666 --> 16:43.079
and I'll help you get what you
want, whatever it is.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.707
You know, things never
work out like you plan.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.258
That's what makes it fun.

16:59.102 --> 17:04.187
Isn't there any other way
to contact help?

17:04.274 --> 17:06.936
Not unless a ship passes
and sees us.

17:07.027 --> 17:11.191
I told you before, these are
the Devastator Reefs.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.862
Boats never come here.

17:12.949 --> 17:19.240
Well then, inland is our only
hope, unless of course
you want to stay.

17:19.331 --> 17:20.787
Please.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.581
Don't leave me.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.579
Don't tempt me.

17:27.297 --> 17:32.337
Zhaan:
May the goddess recognize the
gentleness of your spirit

17:32.427 --> 17:35.965
and guide you to your
ancestors.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.640
( sniffles )

17:41.728 --> 17:44.515
Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.722
You live.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.317
As does Moya.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.938
(deep whirring)

17:51.571 --> 17:52.947
(gasps )

18:01.206 --> 18:02.867
Zhaan:
What kind of repellent
game is this?

18:02.958 --> 18:06.325
Upon my first exploration
of Moya,

18:06.419 --> 18:11.789
I knew the circumstances that
produced her gunship offspring,

18:11.883 --> 18:14.590
and I knew she was
a worthy soul.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.339
Then why did you put her
through this?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.511
To see if you were worthy.

18:18.598 --> 18:27.472
These are gentle beasts who
will ultimately follow the
directions of those in control.

18:27.565 --> 18:31.103
Should you desire it,
priestess,

18:31.194 --> 18:36.484
you could produce an army
of killing machines.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.405
But Zhaan would never...

18:38.493 --> 18:40.108
Of course she wouldn't.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.615
We know that now.

18:42.706 --> 18:46.915
We are confident that you will
protect Moya vigorously

18:47.002 --> 18:51.120
against those who seek
to exploit her.

18:51.214 --> 18:54.126
You are worthy of that
responsibility.

18:54.217 --> 18:58.802
If that is so, then I demand
you leave this ship immediately.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.424
As you wish.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.506
But first...

19:02.600 --> 19:07.811
Moya wishes to speak with you.

19:07.897 --> 19:10.058
Moya:
Zhaan...

19:10.150 --> 19:11.105
( laughs softly)

19:11.192 --> 19:14.275
One request.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.023
Anything, Moya.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.025
222143;;

19:18.116 --> 19:20.027
(laughing)

19:22.912 --> 19:25.039
( applause )

19:30.378 --> 19:32.164
It's good that you came.

19:32.255 --> 19:33.461
Do you know where Crichton is?

19:33.548 --> 19:35.209
Honestly?

19:36.176 --> 19:38.212
No.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.919
But I'm as anxious to find
him as you are.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.130
For his wormhole knowledge.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.760
Hmm.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.888
That's secondary at this point.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.221
I'm without accompaniment,
totally unarmed.

19:51.316 --> 19:55.935
Should the Empress wish
to execute us,

19:56.029 --> 19:58.691
I have no doubt she
would succeed.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.864
So now we are allies?

20:00.950 --> 20:02.451
Hmm.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.821
Effectively, yes.

20:06.873 --> 20:12.960
I assume you know Sastaretski
Cargn, the Scarran Emissary?

20:14.339 --> 20:17.046
And his alliance with
Prince Clavor.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.634
Who's next in line for
the throne.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.882
So, they are our natural
suspects.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.341
What do you want, Scorpius?

20:29.354 --> 20:33.347
I will help you get Crichton
off this planet alive,

20:33.441 --> 20:38.310
collect the information I
need from his mind and
release him to you,

20:38.405 --> 20:40.896
unharmed.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.026
You're half Scarran,
aren't you?

20:43.118 --> 20:44.608
By which measure I should
not be judged.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.660
Cargn:
Because it would
find him lacking.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.658
Ka D'Argo, is it?

20:49.749 --> 20:52.912
Luxan? A great race of warriors.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.254
I am honored.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.954
And to you, biological mistake,

20:58.049 --> 21:02.008
I commend your plan, having an
agent marry the Princess.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.429
How did you defeat my DNA
alterations of her?

21:06.516 --> 21:09.178
Scorpius is not in league
with Crichton.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.634
We despise him.

21:10.728 --> 21:15.267
Truly? Have I misjudged the
situation that badly?

21:15.358 --> 21:18.270
Even if you establish diplomatic
ties with this dynasty,

21:18.361 --> 21:20.977
that would mean that we,
Peacekeepers,

21:21.072 --> 21:24.155
would have to respond,
preventing it.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.233
And that could mean a
total conflagration.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.158
But who would be seen
as aggressor?

21:28.246 --> 21:32.114
All but sealing their access to
the Uncharted Territories?

21:32.208 --> 21:33.414
(growling)

21:33.501 --> 21:34.911
Aah!
-Luxan brute,

21:35.003 --> 21:36.959
where is Crichton?!

21:37.046 --> 21:38.126
I don't know.

21:38.214 --> 21:41.251
Has he been reconstituted into
flesh and blood form?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.298
Agh! I... I don't know.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.593
Is there anyone who does?

21:45.680 --> 21:48.262
Chiana... think she does...
but...

21:48.349 --> 21:49.475
Enough!

21:53.062 --> 21:55.018
I will offer you a deal.

21:55.106 --> 21:59.099
I would rather race you to
the Nebari girl Chiana.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.311
The means to our
different goals...

22:02.405 --> 22:03.770
may be the same, Emissary.

22:03.865 --> 22:08.108
What about the coming
conflagration between
our species?

22:08.203 --> 22:13.698
If you wish to provoke
Peacekeeper might, well,
we shall oblige,

22:13.791 --> 22:15.782
by defeating you.

22:15.877 --> 22:19.290
I would still rather race
you to the girl.

22:21.216 --> 22:23.127
( groans )

22:23.218 --> 22:24.503
Please!

22:24.594 --> 22:27.176
"Please..." Stop dragging you?

22:27.263 --> 22:28.719
No, but it...

22:28.806 --> 22:31.297
I know, it hurts.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.848
You want it to not hurt?

22:32.936 --> 22:34.472
Well next time...

22:34.562 --> 22:37.304
hold on to the frelling wall!

22:40.109 --> 22:41.690
Rygel!

22:41.778 --> 22:42.528
Uh?

22:42.612 --> 22:43.727
Have you seen Chiana?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.106
No. Have you tried...

22:45.198 --> 22:47.314
( hiccups )
looking under your sheets?

22:47.408 --> 22:49.114
I think Scorpius and the
Scarran may have her.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.067
They think she knows were
John and Aeryn are.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.494
We were looking together...
when she split off.

22:53.581 --> 22:57.574
Yeah?
-I'm so nervous, I had to
stop for a bite.

22:57.669 --> 22:59.159
Which I'm too nervous to eat.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.290
Yeah, alright.
What's the matter?

23:01.381 --> 23:02.791
I asked around.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.589
The last time the Empress
threatened to execute
off-worlders...

23:05.677 --> 23:06.541
(hiccups)

23:06.636 --> 23:08.126
she did.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.802
Rygel...

23:10.431 --> 23:12.012
I need your help.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.809
They're going to torture her
and she doesn't know anything.

23:17.105 --> 23:20.597
I'll float above the streets
for a better view.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.523
Yes!

23:23.736 --> 23:25.476
We'll find her.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.109
What the frell is that?

23:33.204 --> 23:37.664
She does not know Crichton's
whereabouts, as I suspected.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.126
So, get rid of her.

23:39.210 --> 23:43.829
I believe she may
have another use.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.756
I don't even want to know.
Cargn, we're through.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.050
Everything you said
would pass has not.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.255
I'm simply trying to ensure
your ascension.

23:53.349 --> 23:58.093
If Crichton is not found by
tomorrow, you'll be crowned.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.223
Through no efforts of
yours, sadly.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.306
Which means I no longer
need your allegiance.

24:02.400 --> 24:06.268
The dissolution of our
relationship is not
yours to effect.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.148
Look, my mother knows about us.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.355
I can't be married until
I renounce you.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.317
I will not allow it.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.777
I'm doing you a favor, a-hmm?

24:15.872 --> 24:19.285
She's going to start the
ceremony by executing
off-worlders.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.991
Get out of here. Hide. Run.

24:22.086 --> 24:26.079
There's no way for me to
escape and you know it.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.916
lam.

24:30.011 --> 24:35.131
l have one final question for
you, duplicitous Prince Clavor.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.384
What?

24:36.476 --> 24:41.470
Do you know that as promised,
lam about to kill you?

24:41.564 --> 24:43.304
No... no...

24:43.399 --> 24:46.232
No!

24:48.321 --> 24:51.028
Yes.

24:54.494 --> 24:58.237
Just a little tingling in the
hands and feet. I'm good to go.

24:58.331 --> 24:59.366
Too late.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.369
Local animals are carnivorous
after dark.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.209
Animals.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.586
Okay, fine. First light.
I have people to protect.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.339
As I must mine.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.294
Can I trust you?

25:17.642 --> 25:20.133
Oh yeah, I'm a regular
Boy Scout.

25:21.604 --> 25:23.469
I do what I have to do.

25:23.564 --> 25:26.806
And I assume you do it well.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.613
( sniffing )

25:39.580 --> 25:41.116
(growling)

25:43.292 --> 25:45.203
I, uh...

25:45.294 --> 25:47.330
l have found Cargn.

25:47.422 --> 25:49.834
It will take both of us
to kill him.

25:49.924 --> 25:53.382
Scarrans have exceptional
strength.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.460
And why do you think
I'll help you?

25:56.806 --> 25:58.637
He has Chiana.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.590
And you want her.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.639
And you don't?

26:03.730 --> 26:05.516
I want John Crichton.

26:08.276 --> 26:09.891
You'll never get Crichton.

26:09.986 --> 26:12.147
He'll die first.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.898
You underestimate the strength
of a relationship

26:18.119 --> 26:22.283
even your friend does not
yet understand.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.289
(laughing)

26:47.273 --> 26:49.434
I want you to have this.

26:57.408 --> 27:00.320
A little stuns and a lot kills.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.277
Tomorrow will be dangerous.

27:03.372 --> 27:06.114
Scorpius, Cargn,
the Empress's anger.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.166
Be careful.

27:09.253 --> 27:11.960
I might not be able
to protect you.

27:13.883 --> 27:17.421
One step at a time, Jena.

27:17.512 --> 27:21.255
One step at a time.

27:27.855 --> 27:31.973
I'm sorry I brought
this on you.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.559
Do you always pursue women
you don't know?

27:35.279 --> 27:37.361
If I'm drawn to them.

27:39.075 --> 27:42.408
Would you be lying here
helpless, giving up,

27:42.495 --> 27:45.282
if Crichton were back there
waiting for you?

27:45.373 --> 27:47.329
You wouldn't understand.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.828
Does your leg hurt?
It's broken.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.709
I'm trained to deal with that.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.290
That's the answer.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.171
You're not trained to deal
with emotions.

27:59.262 --> 28:01.253
So you're afraid of them.

28:02.431 --> 28:04.012
Emotional pain...

28:04.100 --> 28:06.091
you wear like a badge.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.846
It means you've been there.

28:07.937 --> 28:14.103
And it can't get calloused
because each fresh hurt
stings like the first.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.353
Why would you want that?

28:15.444 --> 28:19.187
Because of all the days
before it hurts.

28:19.282 --> 28:23.901
The good days, when
you're in love.

28:27.874 --> 28:33.995
It's too bad you can't
get back to at least

28:34.088 --> 28:36.500
tell Crichton how you feel.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.009
What difference would it make?

28:39.093 --> 28:41.675
He's a frelling statue.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.263
But he can hear.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.383
He can see.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.214
He'll know, Aeryn.

28:48.269 --> 28:50.351
At least he'll know.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.448
Crichton:
You're late.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.450
I'm moving a little slow.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.248
Are you ready to do this?

29:13.336 --> 29:16.294
I've grieved with the
best of them.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.995
All right, showtime.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.001
I hope it all works out.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.083
One way or the other.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.641
We're not compatible.

29:31.687 --> 29:32.847
(glass breaking )

29:32.939 --> 29:35.180
You always know just
what to say.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.185
Not always.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.734
But sometimes I know who
to say it to.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.527
Give me some time
before you enter.

29:49.330 --> 29:51.787
(grunting and panting)

29:54.460 --> 29:55.700
Aeryn.

29:55.795 --> 29:56.784
What?

29:56.879 --> 29:57.994
Look.

29:58.089 --> 29:59.499
Look.
LUUK.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.129
Hello, do you need help?

30:07.223 --> 30:10.340
Stay there.
I'll come and get you.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.218
Yes.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.227
Dregon:
Aeryn?

30:20.194 --> 30:21.980
Listen.

30:23.155 --> 30:27.068
I know this didn't turn out
like we wanted.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.697
I know I was a hindrance.

30:30.788 --> 30:32.779
But I was hoping...

30:32.873 --> 30:34.454
we could go out again?

30:38.087 --> 30:41.250
No! No! This can't be!

30:41.340 --> 30:43.296
I'm sorry, Jenavian.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.215
There was nothing we could do.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.135
Surely the Empress knows that
this is the Scarran's work.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.132
How could she not?

30:49.223 --> 30:50.804
Of course she knows!

30:50.891 --> 30:52.802
And he will be the first one
put to death.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.144
Why the rest of us?

30:54.228 --> 30:58.187
Because, fool that he was,
no offense,

30:58.274 --> 31:00.981
Prince Clavor was her son.

31:01.068 --> 31:03.480
You will all be arrested
and executed.

31:03.571 --> 31:07.610
Crichton:
I feel compelled to disagree
with the Empress on that decision.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.156
Crichton... Crichton!

31:09.243 --> 31:10.198
Hey, Sparky.

31:10.286 --> 31:11.526
Oh, thank the spirits.

31:11.620 --> 31:15.238
Jena. Sorry about your Prince,
but I hear he deserved it.

31:17.334 --> 31:18.915
(sobbing)

31:19.003 --> 31:21.415
Your Excellency, who defiled
your position? Who rescued you?

31:21.505 --> 31:23.245
Later. Rygel, what about
the others?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.296
Nothing on Aeryn. I'm sorry.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.045
D'Argo's with Scorpius.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.593
They think the Scarran has
Chiana So they're gonna
to kill him.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.511
Crichton, wait!
Where are you going?

31:31.599 --> 31:34.215
I don't know. I'll let you
know when I get there.

31:34.310 --> 31:37.848
I'm assuming my execution
is off.

31:46.322 --> 31:48.153
Chiana!

31:48.240 --> 31:50.151
(whimpering)

31:50.242 --> 31:53.075
Stay back!

31:55.247 --> 31:59.160
He cannot damage your brain
from this distance,

31:59.251 --> 32:02.334
but any closer...

32:02.421 --> 32:04.161
There are two of us and
only one of him.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.043
How badly do you want him dead?

32:07.927 --> 32:09.383
(Chiana whimpering)

32:12.264 --> 32:15.927
No closer or the girl dies.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.634
That will not help Prince
Clavor become king.

32:18.729 --> 32:23.268
Agreed.
This is about killing you.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.065
The girl.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.063
Has she told you where
Crichton is?

32:27.154 --> 32:29.861
Of course not.
She doesn't know.

32:29.949 --> 32:34.283
But she did say you aren't
allies, and that in all
probability,

32:34.370 --> 32:38.204
you did not come here
to impede my plan.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.999
It must be painful to realize
that you are defeated,

32:42.419 --> 32:46.003
yes, defeated,

32:46.090 --> 32:50.333
by nothing more than your
own suspicions.

32:50.427 --> 32:53.339
Too hot in here, Scorpius?

32:53.430 --> 32:54.590
What's the matter?

32:54.682 --> 32:57.219
When he becomes incapacitated,

32:57.309 --> 32:59.800
I shall turn full
attention to you!

32:59.895 --> 33:01.931
Nothing. It's nothing.
Don't listen to him.

33:02.022 --> 33:06.356
Because if you do, you'll know
this mutant's weakness.

33:06.443 --> 33:13.281
That his Scarran half loves
the heat, thrives in heat,
craves heat.

33:13.367 --> 33:19.283
But his Peacekeeper half is
destroyed by that same warmth.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.364
Is this true?

33:22.585 --> 33:24.997
Thermal regulator suit,

33:25.087 --> 33:28.375
cooling rods inserted directly
into his brain.

33:28.465 --> 33:31.207
Tell me the rumors are true.

33:31.302 --> 33:37.172
Please tell me your search for
thermic constancy is
tormentful.

33:37.266 --> 33:39.177
(yelling)

33:48.194 --> 33:49.684
( screaming )

33:59.705 --> 34:01.161
Luxan coward.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.580
Now you will die!

34:07.421 --> 34:08.661
Hey!

34:08.756 --> 34:10.121
Crichton!

34:21.268 --> 34:23.133
( screaming )

34:24.813 --> 34:29.273
You haven't defeated me!

34:29.360 --> 34:30.770
Obviously not.

34:30.861 --> 34:35.400
But you dumped me in the acid,
so let's see how you like it!

34:37.243 --> 34:39.484
( screaming )

34:52.800 --> 34:53.380
( screaming )

34:53.467 --> 34:55.253
Chiana!

34:57.763 --> 34:59.378
No!

35:04.186 --> 35:06.643
You're the best.
-How Batman was that?!

35:07.398 --> 35:08.729
You guys okay?

35:08.816 --> 35:10.932
We're fine, John.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.277
It's good to see you.

35:12.361 --> 35:13.441
You, too.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.236
What about Scorpy? Is he dead?

35:16.323 --> 35:20.191
If he isn't, he should be by
the time you come out.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.622
( screaming )

35:41.265 --> 35:43.426
I'm not your enemy.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.430
I'm not your friend.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.188
You leave me the hell alone.

35:51.275 --> 35:53.857
Or the next time we part,

35:53.944 --> 35:56.105
one of us will be dead.

36:32.399 --> 36:35.562
I am sorry if it upsets your
line of succession,

36:35.652 --> 36:38.029
but I am not going to
be a statue again.

36:38.113 --> 36:42.026
I understand your concerns,
as I'm sure you must
understand ours.

36:42.117 --> 36:46.736
However, if you're the kind
of man that would walk away
from his own child,

36:46.830 --> 36:48.161
we would not want you to rule.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.533
Child? What the hell are
you talking about?

36:49.625 --> 36:51.661
My daughter is pregnant
with your seed.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.868
How? Whoa! How? No, no.
We never...

36:53.962 --> 36:56.624
Samples from the DNA comparison.

36:56.715 --> 37:03.678
Did you really think a system
this stable would leave so
important a detail to chance?

37:05.015 --> 37:06.391
Make me a statue.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.181
You change your mind so quickly.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.054
A child deserves two parents.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.808
My child deserves a father.
Make me a statue.

37:13.899 --> 37:18.359
Counselor Tyno, arrange for
this honorable man

37:18.445 --> 37:22.313
to reundergo the
transmutation process.

37:22.408 --> 37:25.195
I'm afraid that's
impossible, Empress.

37:27.538 --> 37:31.656
Recall that Crichton
is not Sebacean.

37:31.750 --> 37:38.087
Based on our findings, human
physiology would not tolerate
the process a second time.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.458
What the hell are you
talking about?

37:39.550 --> 37:42.212
If you stood beneath that
machine again, you would die.

37:42.302 --> 37:44.839
She won't be defrosted for
another 80 cycles.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.342
I'm not going to live that long.
lwon't be there for them!

37:47.433 --> 37:48.639
I know!

37:48.725 --> 37:50.431
I'm sorry.

38:01.238 --> 38:03.024
You take my place.

38:04.324 --> 38:05.404
I can't.

38:05.492 --> 38:06.652
Nobody knows me, right?

38:06.743 --> 38:08.608
The public, they don't
know who I am.

38:08.704 --> 38:11.241
Your unveiling was to be
your introduction.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.783
Right.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.537
Counselor Tyno can be
your new king.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.492
Their chromosomes are
not compatible!

38:17.588 --> 38:20.125
It doesn't matter.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.046
She's already pregnant.

38:22.134 --> 38:25.376
And it satisfies everything
that you need.

38:26.513 --> 38:30.005
And it gives my child
a good father.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.808
And they love each other.

38:42.613 --> 38:44.023
( headset beeps )

38:44.114 --> 38:45.729
What do you say?

38:45.824 --> 38:47.906
Does this work for you?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.405
Yes. Thank you.

38:50.496 --> 38:54.956
I'm sorry that I won't
be around.

38:55.042 --> 38:58.705
I'll never forget.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.336
It's your call.

39:07.471 --> 39:11.931
As long as the secrets we forge
in this room do not escape,

39:14.228 --> 39:16.184
it can be done.

39:20.609 --> 39:23.066
Well, there you go.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.066
Good guys win for once.

39:30.327 --> 39:33.819
And l have a child that
I'll never know.

39:36.291 --> 39:40.580
Princess Katralla wants to
know if you'd like to see
your offspring.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.165
Yes.

40:03.569 --> 40:04.775
Hi, there.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.988
Hi. Are you my Dad?

40:08.532 --> 40:10.272
Yeah, that's right.

40:10.367 --> 40:12.198
I love you, Daddy.

40:53.493 --> 40:55.825
You take care of my
little girl.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.001
So how come Crichton didn't
kill Scorpius?

41:09.092 --> 41:11.424
D'Argo:
It was a mistake.

41:11.511 --> 41:15.049
One that I fear will
come back to haunt us.

41:15.140 --> 41:20.055
Yeah, but he can't follow
us, right?

41:20.145 --> 41:23.433
Well Pilot says that
we're safer now.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.857
Did he tell you what
happened to Moya?

41:28.945 --> 41:30.560
Zhaan, either.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.989
Rygel thinks they were scared
I just think they were lost.

41:34.076 --> 41:37.284
Either way, they're keeping
it to themselves.

41:38.246 --> 41:39.907
Hey.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.253
I'm very proud of you.

41:49.174 --> 41:51.256
I'm proud of you.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.387
You handled yourself well.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.338
Well, you handled meself
well, too.

42:01.311 --> 42:03.723
What's the matter?

42:03.814 --> 42:08.023
Aw, I just can't stop thinking
about Crichton will never see
his daughter again.

42:09.319 --> 42:12.311
Hits pretty close to home, huh?

42:12.406 --> 42:19.027
The fact that I may never see
my son again is a grief I would
wish upon no one.

42:19.121 --> 42:22.409
It pains me to think of what
he's going through right now.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.209
It pains me, too.

42:35.721 --> 42:39.339
And you thought we weren't
compatible.

42:45.897 --> 42:51.187
Zhaan said the surgical
reconstructors did an excellent
job on your leg.

42:51.278 --> 42:53.985
There's no sign that it
was ever broken.

42:55.866 --> 42:58.278
Yeah, Iwas, uh...

42:58.368 --> 43:01.030
worried about you when you
didn't show up for the wedding.

43:03.123 --> 43:06.331
Anyway, I'm... I'm just
glad you're okay.

43:09.087 --> 43:12.250
And I have noticed that you're
not talking to me.
