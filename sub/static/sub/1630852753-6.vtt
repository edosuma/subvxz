WEBVTT

00:58.725 --> 01:03.480
Artist girl. I've heard a lot about you.
Everybody talks about you.

01:05.147 --> 01:07.609
That's quite the bullet
you're taking for your boy, Aniq.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.903
You're really sure I didn't do it?

01:09.987 --> 01:13.991
No. I'm not sure at all. But did you?

01:14.825 --> 01:17.619
You ever feel like
there's this "you" inside you

01:18.287 --> 01:20.706
who's the person you always wanted to be?

01:21.498 --> 01:25.711
And there's also this "you"
that you never thought you'd be,

01:25.794 --> 01:27.671
and you can't believe you are?

01:28.297 --> 01:31.008
That was confusing, and I'm a little lost.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.594
- I have a confession to make.
- Well, shit.

01:34.553 --> 01:38.432
You just said the magic words.
Tell it from the top, honey.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.142
Okay, so…

01:41.018 --> 01:42.895
Unlike everyone else here tonight,

01:42.978 --> 01:45.439
it wasn't weird
for me to be at our high school.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.859
It's almost like I never left.

01:49.985 --> 01:53.113
I can't tell you how many times
I've walked through that breezeway.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.990
Four years of high school.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.408
That skirt's too short.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.579
Ten years as an art teacher
and school administrator.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.414
That skirt's too short.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.958
Oh, God, am I Mrs. Kranwinkle now?

02:06.293 --> 02:07.461
I used to be fun.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.630
Fun Zoë.

02:09.713 --> 02:13.425
And somewhere deep inside
my cluttered brain, she is still there…

02:13.509 --> 02:16.595
ready to do Jäger shots
off the belly button of life.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.140
So tonight, I let her out.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.478
Let me out.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.898
Oh, no. Oh, no.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.657
Oh, wow. I have been cramped in there
since the day you got pregnant.

02:36.740 --> 02:41.328
Jesus Christ. All right!
Gonna have to make up for some lost time.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.705
Are these bigger?

02:43.789 --> 02:48.168
Yeah, they're a half cup bigger, but
the bra's doing a lot of heavy lifting.

02:48.252 --> 02:52.047
I made a list of the things
we should do tonight.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.967
Of course, you made a list.
Why is it torn in half?

02:55.050 --> 02:57.678
Well, I felt the Uber driver judging me.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.222
Then when he wasn't looking,
I taped it back together.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.725
Wait, you brought tape to a party?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.311
I bring tape everywhere.

03:06.812 --> 03:10.816
Oh, my God. I can't believe we're,
like, the same person.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.570
Is this something
I should be concerned about?

03:15.279 --> 03:18.615
Oh, no, no, n--
I'm just dramatizing my internal conflict.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.784
So should I be concerned about that?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.035
No.

03:22.119 --> 03:26.206
So you talk to yourself often
and answer questions?

03:26.290 --> 03:28.292
N-- This is just a metaphor.

03:29.751 --> 03:30.878
"Steal a centerpiece."

03:30.961 --> 03:32.337
- Boring.
- "If they're tasteful."

03:32.421 --> 03:34.590
"Imbibe straight from the bottle."

03:34.673 --> 03:35.966
That's fun.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.970
"Number seven. Make out with someone with
whom you otherwise would not out make."

03:40.053 --> 03:43.432
Gross! "With whom"? No.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.642
- Knock. Knock. Hey, I'm sorry.
- Bruh.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.562
I can't let this happen.
Look, Zoë, you don't have to do this.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.315
I mean, I do a little.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.068
Yeah, you do have to be in here, because
you are being investigated right now.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.946
We both know, you know,
that you didn't do anything.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.907
We don't both know.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.034
She could be hiding some--

04:02.117 --> 04:03.869
You know what? Get the hell out of here.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.871
You're not even supposed to be
in here now.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.955
- Okay.
- You are a suspect.

04:07.039 --> 04:10.000
Close the door behind you.
Respect the process, bro!

04:10.542 --> 04:11.543
Now you, Zoës,

04:11.627 --> 04:14.046
- both of y'all need to talk faster.
- Okay.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.589
Answer your phone.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.175
- What about my phone?
- Answer your phone.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.426
Answer my phone?

04:19.510 --> 04:21.845
I called your phone,
and I left mine in the studio.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.849
That way we can listen
from the other phone.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.893
You're a genius. You're a genius.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.646
- You're a genius.
- Well, just whisper it, you know?

04:31.396 --> 04:34.942
Ten percent battery? How do you even live?
Are you a psycho?

04:35.025 --> 04:37.486
There's gotta be a thousand chargers here.
Let's find one.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.820
- It's a good plan.
- Yep.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.493
- If we're too far apart, buds won't work.
- Kinda like these two buds.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.036
Yes.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.163
- Let's find a charger together.
- Just rephrase that.

04:48.247 --> 04:51.166
And tonight was gonna be Fun Zoë's night.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.127
All right, listen, bitch.
How about you let me drive tonight?

04:54.211 --> 04:56.421
- You're pushing my head. Nope.
- It's my head.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.422
- Suck it.
- All I know is

04:57.506 --> 05:00.092
- when I have to pee, my balls hurt.
- Brett?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.053
Can she see me?

05:03.136 --> 05:04.388
I got this.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.181
Where is Maggie?

05:06.265 --> 05:07.432
She's with Veronica.

05:07.516 --> 05:08.517
This is my night.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.727
- My night.
- Yeah, and it's my reunion too.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.812
So just…

05:12.980 --> 05:13.981
and…

05:14.815 --> 05:16.733
That is what he sounded like to me.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.695
- Like he had a fart for a mouth?
- Y-- So you've met him?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.154
Okay, shake it off.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.447
Hey, Zoë.

05:23.615 --> 05:24.825
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God. Aniq.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.912
Sorry about that. I don't know
my own strength, I guess.

05:29.538 --> 05:33.542
It's Aniq.
He's still kind of adorable, right?

05:34.168 --> 05:38.130
Yeah, adorable like the cards
Maggie gives you on Mother's Day.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.715
Yeah, I'll see you inside.

05:40.215 --> 05:44.720
Oh, come on. He was always so sweet,
and we would joke around in chem and--

05:44.803 --> 05:46.638
No. Uh-uh. It's my night,

05:46.722 --> 05:48.557
and we are not gonna have a conversation

05:48.640 --> 05:50.267
- with the nice, safe guy tonight.
- Hi.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.813
We used to do dumb shit just because,
you know, we could. And it was fun.

05:54.897 --> 05:58.734
So we're gonna wild out and find
the hottest, funnest guy at this party,

05:58.817 --> 06:00.652
and we are going to smash mouths.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.782
- Zoë! So good to see you.
- So good and amazing.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.870
Girls, I have been waiting
for this night for so long.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.288
Remember prom?

06:11.371 --> 06:14.499
I can't wait to catch up
and get fucked up like we used to.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.295
No.

06:18.378 --> 06:22.549
Why-- I mean, no way.
Wha-- Why didn't you tell me?

06:22.633 --> 06:24.301
We didn't know how to tell you.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.136
Or really when would be the right time.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.555
- Because your life is a mess.
- A hot mess.

06:28.639 --> 06:33.560
I'm gonna go drink because I'm not
pregnant, and I can do whatever I want.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.979
- Sorry. Bye. Love you, girl.
- Love you.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.151
What is that? What are they doing?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.278
Oh, yeah,
that's the face people make at us now.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.198
They don't know
how to talk about the divorce,

06:46.281 --> 06:49.243
so instead they make this face
with sad puppy dog eyes

06:49.326 --> 06:52.621
like we're a five-year-old
who just dropped her ice-cream cone.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.707
How are you? Are you okay?

06:55.791 --> 06:58.460
I can't imagine going through this.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.712
How is Maggie doing with it all?

07:00.796 --> 07:04.091
If my husband left me,
I would kill myself.

07:04.174 --> 07:07.094
But not you. Don't you do that. No.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.097
- This is not fun.
- Welcome to my world.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.351
Okay, you know what?
Just like prom, we are making our own fun.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.062
Wait. What are you doing?

07:17.145 --> 07:20.774
Going to the club
And having sex

07:20.858 --> 07:23.443
The DJ is my pillow
And the music's my bed

07:23.527 --> 07:26.655
Hey. Oh. No, it's cool. Walt.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.117
Wait. No, no, no.
This is not on the list. We can't sing.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.329
If I could turn back time

07:35.455 --> 07:38.542
If I could find a way

07:40.419 --> 07:44.298
I'd take back those words
that've hurt you

07:44.840 --> 07:46.675
And you'd stay

07:46.758 --> 07:47.759
All right!

07:47.843 --> 07:50.804
If I could turn back time

07:51.930 --> 07:54.850
If I could find a way

07:55.392 --> 07:59.104
- Hot. Fun. Dumb.
- What are you talking about?

07:59.188 --> 08:01.607
He with whom we shall freaking out make.

08:01.690 --> 08:06.486
Eugene? He's just the same weirdo he was
in high school but with a sneaker deal.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.905
Yeah, but he's famous.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.490
Women throw themselves at that guy.

08:10.574 --> 08:12.576
Gross. We are not a groupie.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.120
No. We're a fellow artist.
He makes art, right?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.206
- Define "art."
- And he's celebrated for it.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.457
Isn't that what we want?

08:18.540 --> 08:21.251
Maybe. I-- I don't know what I want.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.297
Respect it good
Attend this reunion like you should

08:25.881 --> 08:27.090
- Oh, my God.
- Right now

08:27.174 --> 08:28.258
This is the wrong song.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.886
- Oh, no. We should save him, right?
- My neck

08:30.969 --> 08:34.181
My back
Marion Barry did some crack

08:34.264 --> 08:36.600
- Remember him?
- A sexy rock star is making eyes at us.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.184
I need you to focus.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.354
My neck

08:40.938 --> 08:41.938
Thank God.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.232
Thought she was singing to me.

08:44.775 --> 08:47.694
- It's okay, man.
- I have to admit, Xavier was fun.

08:47.778 --> 08:48.987
I mean, I'm fun.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.156
At least for a minute.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.116
I've actually been kind of stressed.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.787
I have this giant big movie role
coming up. It's an important picture.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.916
Problem is I need to get this character's
laugh down before we shoot.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.377
I want it to be really authentic, like--

09:03.460 --> 09:06.046
All right, how does this sound?
I've been practicing a bit.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.097
What the hell?

09:15.180 --> 09:16.181
He's so method.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.809
You-- I don't know. You go.
I wanna learn from you.

09:20.978 --> 09:25.649
Okay. That's an okay start. I like it.
But maybe, like, louder and bigger.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.943
You know,
like I just said something super funny.

09:32.823 --> 09:35.158
Go back to your chambers. I am flirting.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.661
I can't wait to talk
from my mouth into your ear.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.372
Great. He was into us.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.166
Hi. Oh, I mean, hey.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.588
Think your neck and back and the rest
of you might be up for an encore?

09:47.671 --> 09:50.132
Nah, I should probably
leave the singing to Xavier.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.717
I am thinking about taking my shirt off.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.929
Oh, so now you laugh naturally?

09:56.013 --> 09:58.348
I'm having actual fun.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.310
Oh, my God. These boobs are wasted on you.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.532
I am not ready for this.
Should we just, like, go home?

10:15.616 --> 10:17.326
- No. I will not be taken--
- You know,

10:17.409 --> 10:19.661
I've always wanted
to see the teachers' lounge.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.414
Grab a bottle. I'll grab my key.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.625
Something hard, not like wine.

10:26.752 --> 10:27.920
It's a screw top.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.671
Oh, God.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.465
Let's go.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.051
This is going incredible.
You're coming across winning.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.763
Nerdy but cool. Hot but also
holy shit. You know what I mean?

10:37.846 --> 10:40.224
This whole night,
I've been chasing her around.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.559
I never really noticed
what was going on with her.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.269
It's not your fault. You didn't know.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.855
Oh, hello, beautiful.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.732
Hey. How's-- How's everybody…

10:48.815 --> 10:50.484
- Talking about the charger.
- Yeah, I--

10:51.610 --> 10:54.446
- Jesus Christ.
- Yep, yep, yep. Walt.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.952
Ha. No, it's taken. Look, 28%.
Anything less than 30 is actually rude.

11:00.035 --> 11:03.121
Oh, my God. Accused of murder,
and you still won't unplug a phone.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.707
- No one'll notice. Real quick.
- Okay.

11:05.791 --> 11:08.418
- Thank you.
- Hey. Hi. What's going on?

11:09.211 --> 11:10.587
Yasper's phone is about to die.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.339
Bummer. Here's the thing.

11:12.422 --> 11:17.094
As you can see, mine is less than 30%,
and that's kind of the universal standard.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.471
- Anything less is pretty rude.
- I totally get that.

11:19.555 --> 11:22.182
But ours is under 5%,
and we're in a bit of an emergency.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.476
- If we could just plug it in?
- Here's the thing.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.521
- Jennifer 2 is lying in a ditch somewhere…
- All right. No, we got it.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.524
- …trying to text me. And my phone is dead.
- We'll find something else.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.276
It's so cool you work here now.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
Yeah. So cool.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.781
Yeah. I took a subbing gig
after college to make money

11:37.865 --> 11:39.741
while working toward a gallery show

11:39.825 --> 11:42.286
and then I got my own art classroom.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.371
Then they offered me vice principal,

11:44.454 --> 11:47.124
and it just seemed like
what I was supposed to do, you know?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.459
Is that what you really wanted?

11:49.543 --> 11:50.919
- Yeah. Maybe?
- No.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.755
- No.
- I guess I don't know.

11:53.839 --> 11:58.594
- You've been a good influence on decor.
- I painted this with my students.

11:58.677 --> 12:02.639
I had a whole plan, but the minute
there's other people involved,

12:02.723 --> 12:04.850
nothing works out
the way you thought it would.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.935
You see,
but that's what's so great about it.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.354
- Yeah?
- Because you had to live with mistakes.

12:09.438 --> 12:12.191
Always forces you to learn new moves.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.693
I guess he is kind of cute
in this lighting.

12:16.445 --> 12:20.324
- Oh, no.
- Zoë, just the person I was talking for.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.452
Looking to. For, to talk.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.829
Oops.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.917
- Nope. We are not doing this now.
- No, no, no. We're not doing this ever.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.003
Wait. I need to say what I say.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.087
You know--

12:36.173 --> 12:37.674
Stay away from me!

12:43.514 --> 12:45.098
Who the hell was that?

12:45.182 --> 12:49.645
Oh yeah, I have a tiny ragey side of me
that comes out when I'm provoked.

12:50.229 --> 12:52.314
- Should we…
- They'll be fine.

12:54.316 --> 12:58.070
Wow, this is exactly how
I thought it would smell.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.655
Like old wet paper.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.906
Oh yeah, that's weed.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.035
Kids still bring throwing stars
and dildos to school?

13:05.619 --> 13:08.956
Some things never change.
It's kinda beautiful.

13:09.039 --> 13:11.583
- Drugs.
- Wait, some of those are laced with--

13:11.667 --> 13:14.044
We can cross this off the list.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.879
List? What list?

13:15.963 --> 13:19.091
it's all the stuff I wanted to do tonight.
It's stupid. I know.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.051
Are you kidding? I love lists.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.636
Of course, you do.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.100
Real wild there.

13:28.684 --> 13:29.810
Are you feeling this yet?

13:29.893 --> 13:32.771
You'll know when I'm feeling it.
I'm an entirely different per--

13:33.355 --> 13:36.275
Okay, okay.
Like, have you ever considered

13:36.358 --> 13:40.404
how deep down we're all just
lost children looking for the womb?

13:40.487 --> 13:43.740
This reunion is a rewombion.

13:43.824 --> 13:48.036
Oh, God. I forgot I get like this
when we do drugs.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.039
It's like I'm all these
different versions of me, right?

13:51.123 --> 13:55.711
So, like, is this "me" me
or a performance of me?

13:57.588 --> 13:59.339
Okay. Now you're definitely high.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.551
There's more to everyone
than just one thing, right?

14:02.634 --> 14:06.972
But now that my life is changing so much,
I can't figure out which "me" to be.

14:07.055 --> 14:10.100
You know, the thing I like about
escape rooms on, like, a deeper level

14:10.184 --> 14:13.020
is that they make you feel stuck,
even hopeless.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.355
But eventually,
everyone finds their way through.

14:15.439 --> 14:18.317
Except for some members
of the Minnesota Vikings one time.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.652
That is so deep, man.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.614
You know I had a crush on you
in high school, right?

14:24.656 --> 14:26.783
What? I had no idea.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.453
It was pretty obvious.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.334
What is this guy doing?

14:35.417 --> 14:38.003
Oh, God. Oh, God. Code red.
He is coming in hot for a kiss.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.713
I say we go for it.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.590
What does your heart feel?

14:41.673 --> 14:44.176
I'm on board,
but only if it doesn't mean we're, like,

14:44.259 --> 14:45.636
stuck with him the whole night.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.517
- Mommy!
- Maggie?

14:52.100 --> 14:53.268
What are you doing here?

14:53.352 --> 14:54.645
Family emergency.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.313
- That is a fucking lie.
- Absolutely.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.774
I called Brett like a thousand times,
but no answer.

14:58.857 --> 14:59.858
What?

15:20.671 --> 15:21.839
Let me ask you something.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.633
If Maggie wouldn't have showed up…

15:25.843 --> 15:27.135
would you have kissed Aniq?

15:27.886 --> 15:29.429
Is that relevant to the case?

15:29.513 --> 15:31.765
- It establishes state of mind.
- Okay.

15:31.849 --> 15:36.895
And yes, I may be a little curious.
I wanna know.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.438
I mean, I don't know.

15:39.273 --> 15:42.818
To tell you the truth, I have been kissing
the same guy since I was 17.

15:42.901 --> 15:46.238
- Damn.
- So to see a different mouth coming at me,

15:46.321 --> 15:49.491
it was… really weird.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.911
I thought,
"What if I'm bad at kissing someone else?"

15:53.537 --> 15:55.497
I don't know how to tilt my head,

15:55.581 --> 16:00.043
or if I was going for the top lip or the
bottom lip or whether I even wanted to.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.421
- Was his mouth open or closed?
- The latter.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.756
- So he was giving you one of these?
- Yes.

16:05.257 --> 16:07.134
Yeah, yeah. That mean he like you.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.888
Yeah, cause if they go like this…
they just tryna get it in you.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.764
Shit. I think that Culp is following us.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.476
Oh, my God. All of his props, dude.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.689
From-- From Yahtzee, the movie!
"I did Yahtzee that coming!"

16:20.772 --> 16:22.900
- Dude, chill. I'm trying to listen.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:22.983 --> 16:27.946
Dude, it's Xavier's unreleased biography,
IX. I wonder if he mentions me in it.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.033
What?

16:31.116 --> 16:33.619
Dude, this is the only place
they didn't let us go into

16:33.702 --> 16:37.289
when we were installing the A/V equipment.
It almost feels like a panic room.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.373
Oh, no!

16:40.292 --> 16:43.045
- What did you do?
- Yeah. I think we're in a panic room.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.214
- I can't hear anything.
- We get no reception.

16:46.465 --> 16:49.301
- Help! Help!
- We're definitely in a panic room.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.552
Stop saying "panic room."

16:50.636 --> 16:52.679
Dude, this is the safest place
we could be.

16:52.763 --> 16:56.141
I don't wanna be in the safest place.
I wanna hear this conversation.

16:56.225 --> 16:58.727
- You shouldn't be in a panic room then.
- Yasper, I love you.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.979
If you say "panic room"
one more time, I'm gonna flip.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.648
- Okay, my bad.
- Thank you.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.192
We are in a panic room though.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.281
What? Where in the hell are--

17:17.871 --> 17:21.625
Those hungry, hungry
hippos have lost their marbles.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.676
Wait, don't you run an escape room?
Well, help us escape from this room.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.261
Yasper, it doesn't work like that.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.345
Don't do this.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.222
- It's what I do when I'm thinking.
- Okay.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.725
Oh, look at this.
We got something. Here we go.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.019
This is something. Look at this.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.104
Can you read lips?

17:42.187 --> 17:44.147
- Yes. 100%. You want me to now?
- Yes, please.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.316
Okay. Oh, my teeth. My teeth.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.152
Zoë, what do you think of Aniq?
Dude, what do you think of Aniq?

17:49.236 --> 17:52.447
I like… I like broth.
My aunt's got weird floppies.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.366
The Hamburger Helper glove--

17:54.449 --> 17:55.951
You can say you don't read lips.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.452
I read lips. Give me a second.

17:57.536 --> 18:02.374
So I found Brett,
managed not to eat him alive,

18:02.457 --> 18:07.045
and then I just
tried to get back to my evening.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.673
Fine!

18:11.466 --> 18:13.677
- So do you have to head home?
- Hell, nah.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.597
Fun Zoë is in charge,
and the last time that happened,

18:16.680 --> 18:20.559
the night ended with me getting my hair
dyed by a stranger behind a Circle K.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.187
So let's get to the after-party.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.689
Okay. How are you gettin' to there?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.317
'Cause I got my whip.
By which I mean a car.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.236
Zoë! Come fly with me.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.198
Yes! Fun!

18:34.865 --> 18:35.866
Ladies first.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.826
Thank you, sir.

18:37.910 --> 18:39.494
We can't bail on Aniq.

18:39.578 --> 18:41.955
Come on. It's on the list.

18:43.207 --> 18:44.791
Hop aboard.

18:45.751 --> 18:46.752
Aniq?

18:46.835 --> 18:49.588
So, are you still an artist, or--

18:49.671 --> 18:52.674
OMG. He remembered. He is so sweet.

18:52.758 --> 18:56.345
You know what? I really dig your shit.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.223
Fellow artists, he digs our shit.

18:59.306 --> 19:03.268
I mean, thank you.
That's nice of you to say.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.062
Hey. Yo, shit, rap on this.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.731
- You should do my next album cover.
- Really?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.900
Aight, tell me if you think
this is a bad idea.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.569
I mean, it's not.
But, like, what if I'm a tiger,

19:12.653 --> 19:15.280
but my fur is, like, money.

19:15.364 --> 19:18.367
And I'm being held by a big, hot baby.

19:21.662 --> 19:26.667
And what if the baby had
a full arm sleeve tattoo of my face.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.877
But not one of those regular,
like, fat babies,

19:28.961 --> 19:31.922
but, like, a hot one
with cheekbones and shit, you know?

19:32.005 --> 19:34.466
And he's like, you know-- He's, like, cut.

19:34.550 --> 19:39.388
I want people to look at it and be like,
"Wow! That baby takes care of its body."

19:39.471 --> 19:40.472
Help.

19:40.556 --> 19:44.560
I don't know how to smoothly transition
the convo away from whatever this is.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.728
We could set off the fire alarm?

19:47.396 --> 19:49.314
"Bye Bye Birdie"?

19:49.398 --> 19:53.277
That was my favorite play we did.
Wow. You still keep this around?

19:53.360 --> 19:56.613
Nah, I keep it around to remind myself
what a nerdy loser I was.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.533
'Cause now
I'm Conrad motherfucking Birdie!

19:59.616 --> 20:00.993
Star of the show, baby.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.537
Actually, the star is Albert,
the nerdy songwriter.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.372
It's not called "Bye Bye, Albert."

20:06.331 --> 20:07.416
You remember that?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.961
Of course, I do.
I loved doing those shows.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.462
It's so funny, right?

20:12.546 --> 20:16.675
In high school, you were, like,
out of my league and now…

20:17.384 --> 20:20.387
You're in it

20:21.680 --> 20:23.849
- It's happening.
- What is?

20:24.349 --> 20:26.101
Lyrics.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.689
I got over being under you

20:30.772 --> 20:34.276
Are you into being under me

20:34.359 --> 20:40.324
You were out of my league
But now you're into my heart

20:43.368 --> 20:46.205
So, when would you need
a mock-up of the album art?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.123
I could work up a sketch for you.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.374
Yeah, whatever.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.794
The art thing was, like, "I care."
You know, I do,

20:52.878 --> 20:55.047
but really it was just a way
to get you up here.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.301
You know, women sometimes
feel awkward telling me,

20:59.384 --> 21:03.764
"I wanna have sex with you, Xavier."
'Cause I'm famous, right?

21:03.847 --> 21:05.974
So, I always try to ease their discomfort

21:06.058 --> 21:08.894
by giving them an excuse
to come to my bedroom.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.604
I'm sensitive like that.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.608
Oh, no. What do we do?

21:14.691 --> 21:16.360
I don't know. Do anything.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.657
- Brett?
- You stay away from my wife.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.159
You broke my branded shrimp tower?

21:24.243 --> 21:25.661
- Listen, I--
- Where is--

21:29.456 --> 21:32.251
She's at my parents'. It's fine.
Take it easy. Relax.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.127
Relax?

21:35.879 --> 21:39.883
Relax? I will destroy--

21:42.052 --> 21:44.179
He isn't worth it, Ragey.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.849
- Zoë?
- Zoë?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.601
The phone is at 2%.

21:49.685 --> 21:51.854
- We've gotta get out of here.
- Try not to panic.

21:51.937 --> 21:53.272
A button.

21:55.315 --> 21:57.025
Detective Culp, Detective Culp.

21:57.109 --> 21:58.735
- Culp. It's Culp. Hey.
- Culp?

21:58.819 --> 22:00.821
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing right here?

22:00.904 --> 22:02.239
Can I help you, gentlemen?

22:02.823 --> 22:05.242
- No need. We're good. Are you good?
- Hell yeah, I'm good.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.410
- Doing good.
- We're good.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.371
Oh, you're sharing earbuds I see.
Whatcha listening to?

22:09.454 --> 22:11.039
Just some tunes. Yeah.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.584
Tunes? That's crazy. I love tunes.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.752
What are you listening to? What music?

22:15.836 --> 22:18.922
I don't think you'd dig this tune.
It's more like-- Like…

22:19.923 --> 22:20.924
It's like a…

22:24.553 --> 22:26.430
And then-- And then--

22:26.513 --> 22:28.974
- Then the cat's like…
- There's a cat in it.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.727
I'd give anything
to listen to that right now.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.937
If you don't mind giving me
a whirl with the EarPod.

22:34.021 --> 22:37.149
You sure?
It's a-- It's probably pretty unsanitary.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.860
- It's in my ear. I had ear infections.
- I can wipe it off.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.612
I've been eating wax-inducing foods.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.697
- I'll wipe it off, gang.
- Okay. Yeah.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.407
Okay.

22:45.490 --> 22:49.828
- Sure. Yeah. Okay.
- It's a lot of wax.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.247
Wiping it off.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.958
There you go. Wiped it off.

23:01.590 --> 23:02.591
I don't hear anything.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.928
That's because the phone was
about to die anyway and now it is.

23:06.011 --> 23:08.430
- It's dead.
- Oh, yeah.

23:08.514 --> 23:10.974
That's why we were out.
We were looking for a charger.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.936
That's crazy. I have a charger on me.
Why didn't you guys just ask?

23:14.019 --> 23:17.731
Why wouldn't we ask a police officer
for help in a stressful situation?

23:17.814 --> 23:20.651
I don't know. Maybe all of human history?

23:21.652 --> 23:22.986
Okay. Take the charger if you need it.

23:23.070 --> 23:26.198
Thank you very much.
And the-- Thank you.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.367
- Good to see you.
- You too.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.701
And I'm psyched that you love tunes.

23:31.578 --> 23:36.041
Well, then Brett did something
I always wondered if he was capable of.

23:36.124 --> 23:40.170
I just…
never thought he would actually do it.

23:42.756 --> 23:43.757
I'm sorry.

23:44.633 --> 23:46.051
- What?
- What did he just say?

23:46.552 --> 23:50.138
I made you feel nuts
for not wanting to stay in this marriage.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.057
And I want you to know you're not.

23:52.140 --> 23:56.061
It's not good enough.
I'm not good enough. Not for you.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.438
I may not be able to earn back your heart,

23:58.522 --> 24:00.858
but I'm gonna do what I can
to earn back your trust.

24:01.984 --> 24:04.903
Maybe not everything has to work out
the way we thought it would.

24:04.987 --> 24:09.032
And we can just… live with the mistakes.

24:09.116 --> 24:11.994
Is that a turkey or an eagle?

24:14.371 --> 24:15.747
We married that.

24:15.831 --> 24:17.541
Should we go find our whom?

24:17.624 --> 24:19.626
To which whom do you refer?

24:19.710 --> 24:22.713
He whom genuinely laugh does us make.

24:23.839 --> 24:25.549
- Aniq.
- Yeah.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.849
- What?
- They're listening to your interviews.

24:33.932 --> 24:36.518
- I don't know how but I swear to God--
- Can we talk later?

24:36.602 --> 24:39.396
I'm in the middle of something,
and it's starting to get juicy.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.568
Okay. Where were we?

24:49.823 --> 24:51.658
Hey, Captain. It's Culp.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.370
So, did you ever find Aniq?

24:55.454 --> 25:00.250
Yeah. I did. There was just… one problem.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.921
Oh, no. He has a guitar.

25:04.004 --> 25:05.714
Why do guys think we like guitars?

25:05.797 --> 25:07.883
Because we sort of do?

25:07.966 --> 25:12.262
Zoë! Zoë, Zoë, Zoë, Zoë, Zoë.
You know, things have gone unsaid.

25:12.346 --> 25:16.183
But I'm not gonna let myself un-say the
things that were said, that were said--

25:16.266 --> 25:19.686
That were gonna be said.
'Cause they're gonna-- I'm gonna said 'em.

25:19.770 --> 25:25.192
You are an angel. An angel
in the s-- Among a sea of turds.

25:25.275 --> 25:29.613
And I'm gonna sing a special song. 'Kay?
And I wanted to sing it earlier,

25:29.696 --> 25:33.283
but this is my final door
that's open and closes open.

25:33.367 --> 25:36.745
- Oh, no. What is he talking about?
- I don't know. This sucks.

25:36.828 --> 25:41.166
This song has a lot of history.
And it goes a little something like this.

25:42.543 --> 25:45.170
Oh, no. My pants.

25:49.383 --> 25:51.844
This night was a total beef.

25:51.927 --> 25:55.097
Sorry, me. I'm going to go back
to my little cage of regret.

25:55.180 --> 25:57.432
See you whenever the midlife crisis hits.

25:57.516 --> 25:58.517
Wait.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.270
Just take the win, okay?

26:01.353 --> 26:04.022
You let me drive. I drove into a ditch.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.985
Not this ditch. This is your ditch.
I mean the jerk upstairs.

26:08.068 --> 26:09.194
That's just it though.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.781
We spent the whole night chasing
anyone we could find to help us have fun,

26:12.865 --> 26:16.535
but we don't need them to have fun.
We just need each other.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.745
Now, that is deep.

26:18.829 --> 26:19.955
I'm listening.

26:20.664 --> 26:24.293
I made a to-do list, damn it. Let's do it.

26:24.376 --> 26:27.004
All for one, and fuck 'em all!

26:38.432 --> 26:39.850
Do you think you should be--

26:53.405 --> 26:54.489
Fun.

26:54.573 --> 26:57.075
Those hungry, hungry hippos have lost--

26:57.492 --> 26:58.493
Oops.

27:00.829 --> 27:03.874
Okay, fun's over. Almost killed someone.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.083
Was that on the list?

27:05.167 --> 27:08.462
I know I'm, like,
not always a big part of "us,"

27:08.545 --> 27:13.425
but maybe it's not healthy to only let
Fun Zoë out once every seven years.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.761
Annoying Stoner Zoë's right.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.931
We can't all be separated all the time,
or we go crazy.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.557
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

27:22.684 --> 27:24.269
Self hug?

27:28.732 --> 27:31.652
Baby girl, I'm so sad we didn't get
to spend more time together,

27:31.735 --> 27:34.530
but I need you to know that
I will forever have your back, okay?

27:34.613 --> 27:37.991
I've been sending Chelsea these psycho
little anonymous text messages

27:38.075 --> 27:41.995
ever since we got here that are like,
"Back off or else."

27:42.079 --> 27:43.455
Or like, "Stay the eff away

27:43.539 --> 27:46.875
or I'm gonna ruin your life and get you
canceled on the Internet."

27:46.959 --> 27:50.879
Isn't that so sneaky of
me and also hilarious?

27:50.963 --> 27:53.674
My son, Jaxson, with an "x,"
taught me how to do it.

27:53.757 --> 27:55.467
He uses it all the time in school.

27:55.551 --> 27:58.220
Well, until he got suspended for,
like, literally no reason--

27:58.303 --> 28:01.932
Why would you do that?
I don't want you to do that. At all.

28:02.015 --> 28:05.435
- I'm just trying to help you, babe.
- You're not helping.

28:05.519 --> 28:07.437
Come to think of it,
you've never helped me.

28:07.521 --> 28:08.647
So let me get this right.

28:08.730 --> 28:12.442
So you're saying Jennifer 2,
who's now missing,

28:12.526 --> 28:14.236
is the one who was threatening Chelsea.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.654
That's right.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.072
Did you tell her?

28:17.155 --> 28:18.866
No-- You're missing the point.

28:20.993 --> 28:24.246
We used to be friends in school.
Not like me and the Jennifers.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.956
Like real friends.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.040
We should talk.

28:27.666 --> 28:30.752
So, we did.
And she hadn't become a monster.

28:30.836 --> 28:35.883
She was just lonely and insecure
and full of regret. Like we all are.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.092
I'm so sorry.

28:37.176 --> 28:39.052
She apologized for everything.

28:39.136 --> 28:42.181
I mean, it wasn't easy,
but I'm glad we talked.

28:42.264 --> 28:43.307
Come here.

28:43.390 --> 28:45.309
I'm less glad she went in for the hug.

28:50.439 --> 28:53.025
Is Xavier upstairs? Where is he?
Have you seen him?

28:53.108 --> 28:54.193
Is he upstairs?

28:54.276 --> 28:56.612
Has anybody seen him?
Did he do this? Did he do this?

28:56.695 --> 28:57.696
It's okay. It's okay.

28:57.779 --> 29:01.074
- I'm wet. And pantsed. Again.
- We'll get you a towel. You're fine.

29:01.158 --> 29:04.912
Oh, hello, Zoë. I wanna talk to you
after I chat with Xavier.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.955
B-R-B. That's "be right back."

29:09.249 --> 29:10.250
I'll be right back.

29:19.927 --> 29:20.928
I think he's dead.

29:23.805 --> 29:27.142
So, you didn't kill Xavier.

29:27.893 --> 29:30.270
- No.
- But you said you had a confession.

29:30.354 --> 29:31.605
I do.

29:31.688 --> 29:35.150
I confess when I first found out
that Brett cheated on me,

29:35.234 --> 29:38.946
I straight up thought I'd do life
in prison for stabbing him 137 times.

29:39.488 --> 29:42.074
Because any one of us could snap.
You said that.

29:42.157 --> 29:46.495
You're high. You're the stoner girl
right now. That's what this is.

29:46.578 --> 29:48.830
- Okay, I get it. I get it.
- No, no, I'm not high.

29:49.623 --> 29:54.086
Tell the story a certain way
and any one of us could've done this.

29:55.629 --> 30:00.634
But tell the story in a different way
and… none of us did this.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.595
What you're saying is,
no one killed Xavier.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.722
'Cause he is dead.

30:05.806 --> 30:09.351
And all signs lead to your boy, Aniq.

30:09.434 --> 30:10.894
Somebody killed him.

30:12.354 --> 30:14.606
But I don't think it was Aniq.

30:14.690 --> 30:17.401
And I'm pretty sure you don't either.

30:18.902 --> 30:22.072
All I'm asking is for you
to give him a chance to prove it.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.077
Damn it, Culp. What did I tell you?

30:27.160 --> 30:29.580
- I'm in the middle of some--
- I'm shutting you down now.

30:29.663 --> 30:32.124
It's the Captain's orders.
You are relieved of your duty.

30:33.584 --> 30:34.668
Boy, bye.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.211
Anyways, back to this.

30:36.295 --> 30:37.713
And I am serious.

30:40.591 --> 30:42.092
You snitched.

30:42.843 --> 30:44.344
There goes your memorabilia.
