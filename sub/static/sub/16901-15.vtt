WEBVTT

00:04.637 --> 00:06.764
This is it, Lemon.
Government.

00:06.906 --> 00:08.567
The true seat
of American power.

00:08.708 --> 00:10.198
This all happening
so fast.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.641
I mean, last week you were
at GE, and this week you're...

00:12.779 --> 00:14.110
What are you
in charge of exactly?

00:14.247 --> 00:15.407
We're sharing the load.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.641
It's a bit of Homeland
Security... We still have that?

00:17.784 --> 00:19.911
...extreme weather preparedness,
and the War on the Poor.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.111
You mean
the War on Poverty.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.414
Yeah, okay,
let's go with that.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.852
So you're never
coming back?

00:23.990 --> 00:26.424
I'm sorry, Lemon, but there's
nothing left for me at GE.

00:26.559 --> 00:28.618
Sure, Geiss could come out
of the coma and say,

00:28.762 --> 00:30.229
"Jackie Boy,
you're the next CEO."

00:30.363 --> 00:31.421
But that's not likely.

00:31.564 --> 00:34.226
The cryogenecists are already
sharpening their head saws.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.857
This is all so weird.

00:36.002 --> 00:37.629
It's making me sick
to my stomach.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.170
Lemon, it's 8:00
in the morning.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.068
Are you eating
those Mexican cheese curls?

00:41.207 --> 00:43.141
Hey, don't knock
my Sabor de Soledad.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.767
I found a prize in here
the other day... I hope.

00:45.912 --> 00:49.279
Lemon, I have to go.
It's time for my freedom search.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.312
Liz Lemon, do these look
like wizard nipples to you?

00:55.922 --> 00:57.150
Well,
I don't know.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.417
Are the lightning bolts
supposed to be going in or out?

00:59.559 --> 01:01.686
Exactly!
It's all wrong.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.853
These worlds are so clear
in my head!

01:04.464 --> 01:06.898
Oh, are these the characters
for your porn video game?

01:07.033 --> 01:07.931
The working title is

01:08.068 --> 01:11.629
"Goregasm... colon...
The Legend of Dong-Slayer. "

01:11.771 --> 01:13.500
Sorry about the wizard,
Tracy.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.130
I'll call
the Korean animators.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.243
Yeah, you fixulate this!

01:17.377 --> 01:18.173
I'm sorry.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.176
Liz Lemon, do you know
what it's like

01:20.313 --> 01:22.406
to be the only one
who cares about your job

01:22.549 --> 01:24.676
when everybody else around
is goofing off

01:24.818 --> 01:26.251
like a bunch of goof-offs?

01:26.386 --> 01:27.683
Yes.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.721
Uh-oh.
Emotions.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.346
You having
your woman times?

01:31.491 --> 01:35.018
What? No. I just had
my woman times last...

01:35.161 --> 01:36.685
Oh, boy.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.986 --> 02:02.648
Why don't I cross off the days
like people in the movies?

02:05.992 --> 02:09.951
I think you're supposed to take
all of them, like, in a row.

02:10.562 --> 02:11.689
Thank you, Cerie.

02:11.831 --> 02:14.391
But I have been sexually active
since I was 25.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.234
Mr. Hornberger, I was wondering
if I could ask you

02:19.372 --> 02:21.397
to write a recommendation
for me to be a page

02:21.541 --> 02:24.032
at the XXIX Summer Olympics
in Beijing.

02:24.177 --> 02:24.871
Sure, Kenneth.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.206
Have you ever wanted to go
to the Olympics, Mr. Hornberger?

02:27.347 --> 02:29.042
I almost went once.

02:29.182 --> 02:30.649
Bad news, archers.

02:30.783 --> 02:34.742
President Carter has decided
to boycott the Moscow Games.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.246
Peanut farmer.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.984
Anyway, I was wondering when you
were gonna come to me for this.

02:40.126 --> 02:41.616
You know the applications
are due today.

02:41.761 --> 02:42.750
Today, sir?

02:42.896 --> 02:45.387
The memo I got said
they were due in two weeks!

02:45.532 --> 02:46.794
No, it's today at 5:00.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.834
I have to write
my personal essay!

02:51.437 --> 02:53.200
Donny?

02:53.339 --> 02:54.533
Parcell.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.505
I thought you'd
be coming out of that door.

02:58.211 --> 03:00.736
Did you get my memo about
the Olympic applications

03:00.880 --> 03:02.108
being due
two weeks from now?

03:02.248 --> 03:03.340
Saboteur!

03:03.483 --> 03:05.781
Looks like you'll be staying
here in New York all summer,

03:05.919 --> 03:08.387
fighting the crowds,
smelling the hot garbage

03:08.521 --> 03:11.786
while I travel to beautiful,
breezy Beijing.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.790
The day's not over yet.

03:30.276 --> 03:32.836
Hey.
Y- You must be Jack Donaghy.

03:32.979 --> 03:35.140
Cooter Berger,
vice chair of Farm Subsidies,

03:35.281 --> 03:38.182
acting head of FEMA,
temporary acting head of the FBC

03:38.318 --> 03:39.546
while the acting head
is on trial.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.677
Wow, you've had a lot of
shake-ups around here lately, huh?

03:41.821 --> 03:43.254
I couldn't
disagree with you more.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.118
The administration
has been streamlined.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.691
And the media
are so obsessed

03:46.826 --> 03:47.884
with the current election,

03:48.027 --> 03:49.585
they've completely forgotten
we're here.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.855
It's an exciting time.

03:50.997 --> 03:51.929
I'm glad to hear it.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.226
I don't like to think of
this President as a lame duck.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.995
I think of him
as a lame eagle.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.496
The, uh, ceiling
appears to be leaking.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.573
No, it's not.

04:02.709 --> 04:04.108
We've looked into it,
and it's not.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.878
If you have any questions, I'll
write down my extension for you.

04:13.486 --> 04:14.384
Do you need a pen?

04:14.520 --> 04:15.987
Nope, I've kind of
gotten used to it.

04:16.122 --> 04:17.019
You don't have pens?

04:17.156 --> 04:18.214
We're not in a recession.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.849
Boy, we've got to crack the whip
around here, Cooter.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.825
You don't have pens.
The roof is leaking.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.157
No, it's not.
I'll show you the study.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.129
Hey, we have a meeting with
the Appropriations Committee

04:27.267 --> 04:27.995
like now.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.226
Oh, no,
I'm not prepared.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.769
I know, I'm not drunk, either,
but we'll manage.

04:45.084 --> 04:46.051
Mother!

04:47.754 --> 04:49.278
Oh, I'm sorry!

04:49.422 --> 04:52.482
I don't know
why I even came up here.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.752
I mean,
I know Jack's not here.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.794
Boy, I am really
going a little crazy.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.759
I don't suppose you want
to be my sounding board.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.773
You're busy.
I'll come back another time.

05:11.711 --> 05:15.545
Warrior, you have defeated
the snake-elf.

05:15.682 --> 05:18.082
Now join me
in the orgy chamber.

05:18.217 --> 05:19.741
The poets will sing
of this night.

05:19.886 --> 05:21.854
Stop! Stop!
It's not working!

05:21.988 --> 05:22.920
It's not...

05:23.056 --> 05:24.819
Not you, Grizz.
You're doing great.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.356
I memorized all my lines
at home.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.619
But, Jenna, you're not
doing good acting.

05:28.761 --> 05:30.058
Don't overthink it.

05:30.196 --> 05:32.721
I don't need
another Judi Dench situation.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.162
Let's just skip ahead
to the list

05:34.300 --> 05:36.359
of player sensuality
options.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.403
These avatars need to be able
to do anything to each other.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.666
Touch my cheek.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.207
Touch my chest area.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.674
Now give me
a little robot.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.938
Touch my butt.
Now like it's a secret.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.172
Touch my knees.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.248
Sexy. Yes.
Touch my knees-butt.

05:50.383 --> 05:53.011
Good. Touch my feet with your knees.

05:53.152 --> 05:54.050
Now that we're in the zone,

05:54.187 --> 05:56.314
I want you to give me
some random sex sounds.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.320
Ahh.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.515
Ohh.

05:58.658 --> 05:59.852
Oh!

05:59.992 --> 06:01.016
Ah. Whoa.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.923
Ah.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.689
Ohhh.
Wonderful, wonderful.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.162
Let's take it again
from the top.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.960
This time, let's record.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.299
Hey, Jack, it's Liz.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.928
Um, maybe you're busy
spreading democracy.

06:14.073 --> 06:15.370
Anyway, give me a call.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.477
Aah!
Things are happening!

06:20.680 --> 06:22.011
Our first order
of business...

06:22.148 --> 06:25.311
The city of Portland
has requested $9 million

06:25.451 --> 06:27.316
to shore up
its dam system.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.614
I can't support that.
"Dam" is a swear word.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.656
I'd support it
if instead of dam,

06:31.791 --> 06:32.951
we called it
a God finger.

06:33.092 --> 06:36.892
Randall, must you bring religion
into everything?

06:37.029 --> 06:38.519
We need pens.

06:38.664 --> 06:39.528
Excuse me?

06:39.665 --> 06:41.360
Gentlemen, madam.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.628
We all know that Rome
wasn't built in a day.

06:43.770 --> 06:44.896
Well,
that's one theory.

06:45.037 --> 06:49.201
But... we have a chance to make
this country great again.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.708
We need hope.
We need change.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.369
We need experience.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.072
We need pens.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.389
Kenneth,
where have you been?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.157
I had to put on my jeans
by myself.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.424
I'm sorry, Miss Maroney.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.727
I'm trying to finish
this application for Beijing.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.861
Did someone
say "Donny"?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.530
No.
No.

07:21.674 --> 07:23.869
Oh.
It's pretty muffled in there.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.875
You'll never get that
application done in time,

07:26.012 --> 07:26.842
Parcell.

07:37.256 --> 07:39.349
That's the only thing I know
how to say in Chinese.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.756
41/2 hours, Hee-Haw.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.064
Donny's right.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.432
I'll never finish
this application in time.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.835
The personal essay is way harder
than I thought

07:53.973 --> 07:56.134
'cause it's just not
in my nature to brag on myself.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.537
Not even
a back-door brag?

07:57.677 --> 07:58.701
What's a back-door brag?

07:58.845 --> 08:00.608
Sneaking something wonderful
about yourself

08:00.746 --> 08:02.304
into everyday conversation.

08:02.448 --> 08:04.211
Like when I tell people,
"It's hard for me

08:04.350 --> 08:06.545
to watch 'American Idol,'
because I have perfect pitch. "

08:06.686 --> 08:07.653
Oh.

08:07.787 --> 08:08.754
Ew.

08:08.888 --> 08:09.752
Now you try.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.948
It's hard for me
to watch "American Idol"

08:12.091 --> 08:14.355
'cause there's a water bug
on my channel changer.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.187
Ugh. It's no use.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.973
Oh, no. Someone's gonna get
more attention than me.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.234
That was amazing.

08:30.376 --> 08:32.844
"Give us pens. "
I mean, how do you do it?

08:32.979 --> 08:34.879
Cooter, I used to work
for a man named Don Geiss.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.241
He taught me
how to be proactive.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.644
I'm going to teach you
the same thing.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.250
I'm so happy
you're here.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.250
I haven't felt this energized
at work

08:41.386 --> 08:43.446
since the two weeks when
they tried to teach us Farsi.

08:46.058 --> 08:46.922
Cool phone.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.026
Excuse me.

08:50.830 --> 08:51.797
Jonathan?

08:52.598 --> 08:53.997
Geiss spoke.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.658
What? He's not out of
the coma, but he spoke.

08:56.802 --> 08:57.860
What did he say?

08:58.004 --> 08:59.528
He said...

08:59.672 --> 09:01.037
Jackie Boy.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.844
Cooter, this is my letter
of resignation.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.708
Would you make sure that it
gets into the right hands?

09:08.848 --> 09:09.712
What?

09:09.849 --> 09:10.975
No!
No way.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.482
What do you want
to do that for?

09:12.618 --> 09:14.313
I just received
a very important phone call.

09:14.453 --> 09:15.317
I've got to back.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.149
But we're gonna
do great things together.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.689
Look, the leak stopped.

09:20.359 --> 09:21.917
I have to get back
to New York.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.119
This is my only chance.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.320
Resignation denied.

09:24.463 --> 09:25.794
You can't deny
my resignation.

09:25.932 --> 09:26.830
Actually I can.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.628
As acting head of the FBC,
I oversee the EWPC,

09:29.769 --> 09:31.168
and I'm denying
your resignation.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.896
You'll stay here
and serve your country.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.836
The head of GE
serves his country.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.033
He provides jobs,
fuels innovation.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.770
He brings good things
to light!

09:41.314 --> 09:42.576
Cooter, I'm begging you.

09:42.715 --> 09:43.647
Please let me go.

09:43.783 --> 09:45.011
Hey, it's not up to me.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.483
Even if I let you resign,
my boss wouldn't.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.588
They don't want people
leaving here anymore.

09:49.722 --> 09:52.054
You're not going anywhere,
buddy!

09:52.558 --> 09:54.219
Hey, the pens are here!

09:57.463 --> 09:59.090
U. S. A!

09:59.231 --> 10:00.425
U. S. A!

10:00.566 --> 10:02.329
U. S. A!

10:02.468 --> 10:03.901
U. S. A!

10:06.505 --> 10:07.767
Hello, friend.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.772
Oh, my God,
you're pregnant.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.001
What?

10:11.143 --> 10:12.838
Yes!
How can you tell?

10:12.979 --> 10:14.173
I just can.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.907
People always underestimate my
instincts because of my looks.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.108
This is no time
for back-door bragging!

10:19.251 --> 10:21.845
I'm just so happy for you.
This is what you wanted.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.012
Yeah, but not like this.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.089
Why not like this, Liz?

10:25.224 --> 10:28.250
As my mom used to say,
"You never want this to happen. "

10:28.394 --> 10:29.918
Have you
called Floyd yet?

10:30.062 --> 10:30.858
What?
Floyd.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.090
You couldn't ask for a better
guy to make a mistake with.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.933
Oh, no.
It is Floyd, right?

10:40.439 --> 10:43.567
Whoo! Those margaritas
were strong.

10:44.677 --> 10:45.837
Can you come inside?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.570
I need a couple light bulbs
changed.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.203
Yeah.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.248
Oh, my God.

10:52.018 --> 10:54.213
How could you have slept
with Dennis?

10:54.353 --> 10:57.049
It was before he tried to
throw me under the subway train.

10:57.189 --> 10:58.486
Oh, my God.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.592
Oh, so you're the only person
in the world

11:00.726 --> 11:02.250
that's allowed
to make sex mistakes?

11:02.395 --> 11:04.761
You had a three-way
with Roseanne and Tom Arnold.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.296
That was two years ago.

11:06.432 --> 11:10.391
Fine. So I made one extremely
unfortunate coupling decision.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.628
So, what are you
gonna do?

11:11.771 --> 11:13.568
Well, obviously Dennis
can't be involved

11:13.706 --> 11:15.333
because he is
a class-A moron.

11:15.474 --> 11:19.103
So I am just gonna be
a kick-ass single mom,

11:19.245 --> 11:22.737
like Erin Brockovich
or Sarah Connor.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.680
Listen to you. You're actually
excited about this.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.218
Yeah, I am,
even though it's Dennis'.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.821
I must really want a kid.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.480
Go to the doctor and get a
blood test so you know for sure.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.490
And while you're there,
try to get me some Adderall.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.631
I'm trapped here.
I can't believe this.

11:40.766 --> 11:43.462
Well, I can't believe the best friend
I've ever had would try and leave me.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.864
Cooter,
look at this place.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.562
This can't be
what you want in life.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.968
Haven't you ever thought
of leaving?

11:48.107 --> 11:49.131
Of course.

11:49.275 --> 11:50.742
Every day.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.741
Every day for two years.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.208
Look at these
resignation letters.

11:55.881 --> 12:00.147
They're written in ketchup,
dirty rock, leak water.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.275
But now you're here.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.217
You're here, and everything's
gonna be better.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.982
We've got pens!

12:05.124 --> 12:07.149
Glorious pens!

12:11.297 --> 12:13.527
Oh, my God!

12:13.666 --> 12:14.655
Oh, my God.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.825
They're caps,
nothing but caps!

12:16.969 --> 12:17.731
Cooter.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.428
That's not my name!

12:19.572 --> 12:21.665
My name is James Reilly!

12:21.807 --> 12:22.831
Cooter Berger?

12:22.975 --> 12:24.806
What do you think I am,
a cartoon dog?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.172
The President
named me that.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.540
He gave you
two nicknames?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.409
Cooter because
I look like a turtle

12:29.548 --> 12:33.348
and Berger because he saw me
eating a hamburger one time.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.418
We have to
get out of here!

12:34.553 --> 12:35.542
Now, that's the spirit.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.485
But if they're
not taking resignations,

12:37.623 --> 12:38.817
there's only one way out.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.256
We have to work together
to get fired.

12:41.393 --> 12:44.851
It wasn't even a hamburger.
It was a sandwich.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.068
Hello, Elizabeth.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.902
Dennis,
what are you doing here?

12:57.042 --> 12:59.067
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.406
Look, I told my mom I got a job,
so I've been coming here

13:01.547 --> 13:02.946
for the past couple weeks
during the day.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.447
What?
How come you're not at work?

13:04.583 --> 13:05.777
Because I forgot
my computer.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.681
No, why am I...
This is my apartment!

13:07.820 --> 13:09.981
There something you want to tell me? No.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.081
<i>Elizabeth, this is Melinda</i>

13:13.225 --> 13:14.715
<i>from Dr. Beauvoir's office.</i>

13:14.860 --> 13:16.293
<i>We'll try
to reach you again later.</i>

13:17.329 --> 13:18.921
I know that message
and I know that tone.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.429
Every one of my sisters
got that message

13:20.566 --> 13:22.124
junior year in high school...
You're pregnant!

13:22.268 --> 13:23.235
What? No.

13:23.369 --> 13:24.267
Really?

13:26.105 --> 13:27.094
Prenatal vitamins?

13:27.239 --> 13:29.070
Yeah, I know
what "prenatal" means.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.438
Pre... before.
Natal... ruined.

13:31.577 --> 13:32.566
Oh, my God.
All right.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.303
First things first,
we're gonna have this baby

13:34.446 --> 13:36.744
at the same hospital I was born
at on Coney Island, all right?

13:36.882 --> 13:37.974
Oh, my God.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.209
Secondly, if it's a boy,

13:39.351 --> 13:41.216
we're gonna name him Morpheus
like that guy in "The Matrix. "

13:41.353 --> 13:43.878
If it's a girl... Ooh, yeah, I
used to boff this chick named Judy,

13:44.023 --> 13:45.115
and I would love
to honor her.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.383
Get out of my apartment!

13:46.525 --> 13:47.822
Don't talk to me
like that.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.087
Morpheus hears everything
that you say. Out!

13:51.163 --> 13:53.188
Your boobs
are gonna get bigger.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.635
You must have been
such a pretty monkey.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.107
What's that,
Miss Maroney?

14:02.241 --> 14:05.335
It's your personal essay,
Kenneth.

14:08.948 --> 14:10.415
Oh, hello.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.574
I didn't see you there.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.744
I was just thinking about
my friend Kenneth Parcell

14:15.888 --> 14:19.153
and how much he personifies
the Olympic spirit.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.225
He's involved
in charity work.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.622
You needed me,
Miss Maroney?

14:22.761 --> 14:23.921
Yes.

14:24.063 --> 14:25.428
Kenneth,
can you take this money

14:25.564 --> 14:27.998
to the many charities
I support anonymously?

14:28.133 --> 14:29.464
Of course.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.963
Oh, Miss Maroney,
this is empt...

14:32.104 --> 14:34.664
He knows the importance
of physical fitness.

14:34.807 --> 14:38.368
I mean, he can lift
almost 100 pounds!

14:38.510 --> 14:39.238
Shh, shh.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.643
<i>Mind, body, spirit?</i>

14:42.781 --> 14:47.741
<i>Kenneth,
I see myself in you?</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:50.481
<i>So brave?</i>

14:50.623 --> 14:52.488
<i>So ready?</i>

14:52.625 --> 14:58.029
<i>To be all that you can do?</i>

14:58.163 --> 15:03.066
<i>So beautiful in every way?</i>

15:03.202 --> 15:09.232
<i>I see myself in you?</i>

15:09.375 --> 15:11.741
Miss Maroney, thank you!

15:13.012 --> 15:15.310
I have 20 minutes.
I'm gonna make it.

15:19.118 --> 15:24.784
<i>I see myself in you?</i>

15:27.192 --> 15:29.285
Oh, Kenneth,
someone was looking for you.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.124
They need 12 boxes
of copier paper on stage one.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.439
Whatever we come up with
has got to be wasteful,

15:44.576 --> 15:46.305
embarrassing
to the administration,

15:46.445 --> 15:47.707
and upsetting
to the voters.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.336
Holy smoke.

15:49.481 --> 15:50.709
What have you got?

15:50.849 --> 15:54.649
In 1994, the Pentagon
explored the possibility

15:54.787 --> 15:56.379
of a nonlethal
chemical weapon

15:56.522 --> 16:00.117
that would, "reduce
enemy soldiers' combat posture

16:00.259 --> 16:02.955
by making them totally gaybones
for each other. "

16:03.529 --> 16:04.393
How gay?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.724
It doesn't say.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.855
The project was abandoned
in the planning stages.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.864
Of course it was.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.662
It would have been expensive,
impractical,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.361
and offensive
to both the red states

16:12.504 --> 16:13.698
and the gayer blue states.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.363
This is exactly
what we're looking for.

16:15.507 --> 16:16.974
A guaranteed disaster.

16:17.109 --> 16:18.940
Like eating a burrito
before sex.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.340
But where would we
get the money?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.709
No congressman in his right mind
would support this.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.611
Don't worry.
I've got a friend in Congress.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.411
But not your best friend,
right?

16:28.087 --> 16:29.452
Yo, Frank.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.385
Oh, my God.
Is that...

16:31.523 --> 16:32.547
Yes.

16:32.691 --> 16:33.715
It's just a prototype.

16:33.859 --> 16:37.158
But I want you to be the first
to play it.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.228
Tell me what you think.

16:38.364 --> 16:39.626
This is such an honor.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.095
I got an
"Additional Filth By" credit.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.162
You earned it.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.474
Good job, Parcell.

16:59.818 --> 17:01.809
Too bad it cost you
a trip to China.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.922
Wait a minute.
Who's this paper for?

17:04.056 --> 17:05.421
No one.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.287
Looks like
you only have 30 seconds

17:08.426 --> 17:10.452
to get your application
to the 27th floor.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.488
And you're not
gonna make it.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.459
Ow! Oh! Oh!

17:18.604 --> 17:19.763
Oh, oh!

17:19.905 --> 17:21.338
Run, Kenneth, run!

17:27.445 --> 17:29.573
He knows!
Oh, God, call me, Jack!

17:29.715 --> 17:31.444
This a disaster.

17:31.583 --> 17:33.881
This baby's
gonna have a father!

17:34.019 --> 17:35.316
Look out!

17:37.856 --> 17:38.982
What?

18:23.368 --> 18:25.529
A gay bomb?

18:25.671 --> 18:27.832
You dragged me out of a meeting
for this?

18:27.973 --> 18:29.270
I was gonna meet Bono.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.272
C. C.

18:31.343 --> 18:34.437
Representative Cunningham.
We'll keep this professional.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.378
I did certain things for you in bed
that you were going to reciprocate.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.110
But then we broke up before
my birthday, so you owe me.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.446
Jack.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.020
This could take weeks
to get approved.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.782
I'll take my chances.

18:44.923 --> 18:48.586
And that would mean I would be
spending my birthday here, so...

18:48.727 --> 18:50.558
All right.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.890
I will help you get fired.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.021
Yes!
I am so on a roll!

18:54.166 --> 18:56.157
No crying in my bath tonight.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.835
<i>Hey, Jack, it's Liz.</i>

19:07.980 --> 19:10.346
<i>Um, maybe you're busy
spreading democracy.</i>

19:10.482 --> 19:11.972
<i>Anyway, give me a call.</i>

19:12.117 --> 19:14.642
<i>Aah!
Things are happening!</i>

19:14.786 --> 19:16.549
<i>Hey, it's Liz Lemon.</i>

19:16.688 --> 19:19.156
<i>Funny story...
I think I'm pregnant</i>

19:19.291 --> 19:21.191
<i>with Dennis Duffy's baby.</i>

19:21.326 --> 19:23.851
<i>Thought you'd be super proud.</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:26.430
<i>Ahh, in a way,
it's what I wanted.</i>

19:26.565 --> 19:28.226
<i>Yeah.
It's gonna be fine.</i>

19:29.568 --> 19:31.433
<i>He knows!
Oh God, call me, Jack!</i>

19:31.570 --> 19:33.060
<i>This is a disaster.</i>

19:33.205 --> 19:34.968
<i>This baby's
gonna have a father!</i>

19:35.107 --> 19:37.507
<i>What? Kenneth just did a flip
into the elevator.</i>

19:38.644 --> 19:42.478
<i>Jack, I've spent the last hour
looking at cribs online.</i>

19:42.614 --> 19:43.512
<i>It's crazy.</i>

19:43.649 --> 19:44.980
<i>Even with
all this Dennis stuff,</i>

19:45.117 --> 19:47.449
<i>all I can think about
is baby hair</i>

19:47.586 --> 19:51.784
<i>and converting my laundry and
newspaper pile into a nursery.</i>

19:51.924 --> 19:53.915
<i>So I-I don't want you
to worry about me</i>

19:54.059 --> 19:55.788
<i>'cause, um, I'm happy.</i>

19:57.262 --> 19:59.560
<i>Oh, and yes, you hear me
eating Sabor de Soledad</i>

19:59.698 --> 20:01.359
<i>'cause I can eat
whatever I want now.</i>

20:01.500 --> 20:03.024
<i>Ooh, hang on.</i>

20:03.168 --> 20:04.294
<i>That's my doctor.</i>

20:06.572 --> 20:08.301
<i>Never mind.</i>

20:08.440 --> 20:10.169
<i>I am not, um...</i>

20:10.309 --> 20:11.571
<i>Never mind.</i>

20:21.820 --> 20:23.014
Lemon, how are you?

20:23.155 --> 20:24.986
It was the cheese curls.
Pardon?

20:25.123 --> 20:28.217
Causing the false positives
on my home pregnancy tests.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.820
Apparently, Sabor de Soledad
gets its special tangy flavor

20:32.965 --> 20:34.523
from evaporated bull semen.

20:34.666 --> 20:37.499
Oh, that explains
your hair's thickness and shine.

20:37.636 --> 20:38.830
I guess in Mexico
women use it

20:38.971 --> 20:41.303
to stop their periods
before Cinco de Mayo.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.068
I'm a little afraid to ask
if you're still eating them.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.139
They're so good.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.874
Lemon, I'm sorry you had to
go through this by yourself.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.313
No, it's okay.

20:52.451 --> 20:55.545
I was actually ready
to have Dennis Duffy's baby.

20:55.687 --> 20:58.588
I guess I'm getting to that age where
I don't care what anybody thinks of me.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.419
You're going to want to get
a very short haircut.

21:00.559 --> 21:01.423
Resist that urge.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.358
And I know now
that I'm definitely ready.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.154
I want to adopt.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.198
Are you sure? What about
artificial insemination?

21:08.333 --> 21:09.664
No, I can't go
to a sperm bank.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.735
The Duffy men use those
like ATMs.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.207
Then, Lemon,
I want to assist you.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.205
What?

21:18.176 --> 21:19.108
With an adoption.

21:19.244 --> 21:21.542
Oh, good Lord, Lemon.
With an adoption.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.511
I know a lot
of well-connected people.

21:23.649 --> 21:26.049
Okay, then, yeah.
Help me. Thanks.

21:26.184 --> 21:27.617
Uh, how was your day?

21:27.753 --> 21:28.879
It was good.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.682
The President
gave me a nickname.

21:30.822 --> 21:31.948
"The Jacker. "

21:34.059 --> 21:35.083
Yeah.

21:38.997 --> 21:42.194
Gentlemen, I regret
to inform you that the gay bomb

21:42.334 --> 21:44.063
could not
be effectively weaponized.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.035
The chemical
dissipates harmlessly

21:47.172 --> 21:48.730
in open tactical environments

21:48.874 --> 21:51.570
and, frankly, could only work if
somehow we could get the enemy

21:51.710 --> 21:53.905
into a closed,
unventilated space.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.479
Ooh, pens!

22:00.185 --> 22:01.516
I feel weird.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.482
Let's do this.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.958
Dude, I played this thing
for a couple hours.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.289
It's okay, I guess.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.796
Frank, you've been
in your office for three months.

22:14.666 --> 22:15.758
What?!

22:15.901 --> 22:18.699
Yes! I'm gonna be
a billionaire!
