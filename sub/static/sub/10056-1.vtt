"What's New in Love"

00:46.800 --> 00:48.900
Every fucking morning.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.800
- I heard that.
- No, you didn't.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.600
- Yes I did.
- I did too.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.700
Hey, Sandy, what the hell.

00:57.100 --> 01:00.500
- Mom!
- It's just for germs, they're for enemy.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.900
- Good luck in your test.
- And I need luck.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.400
- [Mumbles], Mom.
- I'm sorry.

01:08.900 --> 01:14.000
Have a great day.
And remember, own your own power.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.300
Powerful Frank can learn.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.100
Sorry.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.600
Don't forget to bring the DVD for my birthday.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.400
I told Lizzie she's not bringing it
for show and tell tomorrow.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.600
- Do I ever forget anything?
- Just do it! Ok, Mom?

01:30.400 --> 01:32.400
Go!

02:33.700 --> 02:37.500
Welcome to the Frank Magic Jr.
6th birthday celebration.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.600
- We have many famous guests.
Famous. -Well, we're here.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.000
Cute.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.500
Yeah, that's it.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.400
Oh, Molly, Molly. 

03:24.500 --> 03:26.300
Molly Foster?!

03:26.300 --> 03:29.900
You're a magician. 
A little magician. 

03:31.900 --> 03:34.500
Doing Sandy a nice favor.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.100
Molly. Yes, Molly. 

03:45.600 --> 03:47.700
Oh, my God!

03:52.600 --> 03:55.500
Mom I don't understand why
we have to move into the city?

03:57.000 --> 04:01.200
The city is the center of everything honey
It will be a fresh start.

04:01.300 --> 04:05.900
Dad said that only minority ventured
Capitalists live in the city.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.500
And now we do too.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.600
Are we gonna meet any transvestite?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.300
What is transvestite?

04:30.400 --> 04:33.500
It is a person who has a penis
and a vagina and they live in the city.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.700
That's not what it is.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.000
Okay, guys, it's the place.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.200
I really have to pee.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.700
Can you hold it a little longer?

04:44.400 --> 04:46.100
Welcome to New York City.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.700
We're only here because
our parents are getting a divorce.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.200
stop smiling or
I'm taking you to Oprah.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.000
- Sadie.
- You know I've read about this.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.500
It's fairly typical behavior for
children of divorced.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.700
How about taking the bags?

04:58.700 --> 05:02.100
Mommy, check this out! We're
writing our names.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.500
Oh God!

05:08.600 --> 05:10.900
You can't move around for
the rest of your life.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.200
It's only been three weeks, mom.
Give me some time.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.400
Oh, such a smart girl.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
She never graduated college,
and you hated her.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.500
But the French, she spoke it so beautiful.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.000
She was from there.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.200
She was a Finklestein,
It is hard not to love a Finklestein.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.800
Anyway, I spoke to your cousin Lou,
and she arranged a job interview,

05:33.800 --> 05:36.600
Women's Center, where she used to work,
Get you out of your punk.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.200
I have a job,
at the coffee shop.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
Oh, it's depressing and you're a college graduate,
Aram, for crying out loud.

05:42.400 --> 05:46.300
You'll finally put that Ladies Studies
major of yours to good use.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.600
It's a minor, Dad
and it's called sociology.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.600
BA from Stanford
Journalism from Northwestern.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.200
You do realize that it's
just a stat checking job?

05:57.500 --> 06:00.900
I've been raising two kids, and

06:03.300 --> 06:05.500
I'm divorced.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.800
And I'm sure I'll be good at this
because I'm very organized.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.900
I love sports,
well not hockey, so much.

06:17.400 --> 06:22.000
You see, once the kids were born
I decided to stay home for a while.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.900
Coz you know, babies
take up a lot of time.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.800
Maybe you don't know.

06:30.900 --> 06:35.200
Anyway, eventually they went to school

06:35.400 --> 06:38.100
and I started having a little time in my hands.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.300
And compiled these
stat books,

06:41.300 --> 06:44.300
and made up this graphing system.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.900
Yeah, hmm.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.600
How?

07:03.700 --> 07:07.500
It's time, and a great
satellite TV package.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.800
Aram Finklestein, that's
a Jewish name, right?

07:19.900 --> 07:22.900
What are your feelings
about women, Aram?

07:23.700 --> 07:26.100
Are you kidding?
I think you're great up until...

07:26.800 --> 07:31.700
Recently I was planning on spending the rest
of my life with a woman.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.400
Not that I wanted to spend it
with a man, I just...

07:38.000 --> 07:40.700
One experience with a woman,

07:43.100 --> 07:49.000
kinda took away my faith in love,
and I guess, everything.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.500
Aram, I know you took some Women's studies
courses in College.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.100
But other than that, do you have any kind of experience

07:59.100 --> 08:01.900
that you think might have prepared you for this job?

08:05.600 --> 08:09.500
I used to buy
tampons for my mother.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.100
You will fit in perfectly, yes.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.900
I have met my soul mate.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.400
You met a really hot French girl
who needed a green card.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.800
- She was so...
- Hot.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.800
- She wasn't that.
- Sexy.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.000
It was something else. She needed me.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.799
Yes, to get a green card.

08:32.900 --> 08:36.900
There's gotta be more meaning
to it than all of this.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.900
You know living at your parents' place isn't
exactly... grab a life by the balls you know.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.600
I'm saving up.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.700
I hate to tell you this but...
you work in a coffee shop.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.000
And your hot French wife
left you for her brother.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.500
Stop it. 

08:54.100 --> 08:55.800
Can I get you something?

08:56.300 --> 08:59.400
Yeah, this ad says...
you have an apartment for rent?

08:59.500 --> 09:00.900
Yet, ours have a...

09:01.500 --> 09:04.700
Which I would be happy to show you.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.700
- Sure.
- Cool.

09:08.700 --> 09:10.300
[Whispering].

09:10.400 --> 09:13.300
I'm Mitchell, and this right here is Aram.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.700
He's trying to figure out the meaning of life.

09:15.700 --> 09:20.300
He also is a wonderful babysitter
if you ever need one.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.000
Just a break of the apartment.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.900
- Hey, little guys.
- Mama, I do not want to live here.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.300
- I want my room.
- How many more apartment are we going to look at?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.900
- I got an apartment.
- You're fast.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.500
It's not great, but my husband
won't be there so that's a plus.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.700
How are you so well adjusted?

09:44.800 --> 09:48.100
All those years with the PTA, I don't have a choose.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.900
How's the job search?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.600
I got one, fact check for SNN.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.500
You are unbelievable, you're almost fully healed.

09:56.500 --> 10:00.700
You know everyone says what a nightmare it is to get divorced
you're bad, I feel good.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.100
No residual or anything?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.400
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.900
Trapped in some suburban hell, same thing

10:09.000 --> 10:11.900
day after day like a
"hamster in a wheel.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.700
Up on your feet, let's ride to happiness.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.200
All you need now to
complete the healing is to get laid.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.800
Oh no, that's one thing
I'm not ready for.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.000
Look I don't expect you
to fall in love with this guy.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.200
This guy?
Oh, no! What have you done?

10:27.200 --> 10:30.300
A chiropractor, who fixed me up with
that whole elevator shaft thing.

10:30.300 --> 10:34.000
Anyway, he smells great, and went
to an Ivy League College.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
- Where?
- Santa Barbara.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.600
That's not Ivy League.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.900
Well, he's in great shape,
and he has a country house.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.500
And I already told him all about you.

10:41.500 --> 10:44.700
Wait, I think that's the kid
who showed me the apartment.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.600
The one that tried to kiss you?

10:46.700 --> 10:49.500
No, he just works
in the coffee shop right below.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.300
- Too bad, he's cute.
- Yeah like 10.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.300
Nice ass, Coffee boy.

10:59.900 --> 11:02.300
Just go out with my
chiropractor, and have a good time

11:02.400 --> 11:05.600
maybe screw him, you know, that's seems right.

11:09.100 --> 11:13.000
Why are you here?
It's been three weeks.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.700
I came to see you.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.400
Have fun.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.000
There's this huge kid,
and he has like so much fat on him.

11:47.100 --> 11:51.600
He sat at me at gym class,
and told me who would change my name to Pablo.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.900
- Frankie, that is terrible, are you okay sweetie?.
- it's Pablo.

11:55.900 --> 11:57.300
and yes, it was fun.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.000
- So, listen...
- Oh, uh.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.800
- What?
- Whenever you say, "So, listen,"

12:02.900 --> 12:04.500
is always something strange.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.800
It's not weird, it's just that I'm
thinking about going on a date.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.500
I don't know, what I really want to but I,

12:10.600 --> 12:13.600
I think it will be a positive step for me..

12:14.400 --> 12:16.500
But I just wanted to see how 
you guys would feel about it..

12:16.600 --> 12:18.200
Are you gonna have sex with them?

12:18.300 --> 12:20.000
That's an inappropriate question..

12:25.900 --> 12:30.800
Hey guys, you know, if we're gonna live in the city,

12:30.900 --> 12:33.400
we're gonna have to learn to deal 
with these kind of stuff ok.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.500
So just stick with me and be polite.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.500
- Hello
- Hi

12:48.800 --> 12:50.800
Thanks you for coming in on such short notice.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.500
I won't normally put you on this type of situation,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.500
without some training,
but we're really in a vine.

12:55.500 --> 12:58.600
- Whatever I can do to help.
- Ok, great, now why don't you put your suit on.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.200
And then meet me at the activities room.

13:00.300 --> 13:02.900
- A suit?
- Yeah, it's in the closet behind you.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.900
Now try to hurry, self-defense class
starts exactly at 5:30.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.200
Mommy, why do you have to do this?

13:09.300 --> 13:13.400
Because now that we live in New York
we're gonna all kinds of different people.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.300
and we need to know
how to deal with them.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.100
Like the man with the penis?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.800
So you're walking down the street,
and all of a sudden you hear...

13:25.400 --> 13:28.100
hey, sweet lips, I like that ass.

13:28.700 --> 13:32.400
Hey mommy, why don't you come over here,
sit on my face...?

13:32.800 --> 13:36.800
Hey, kid, how would like
to make a quick $ 100?

13:36.800 --> 13:40.400
- Yes, sure.
- No, you don't kid, you don't want that money.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.300
Self-preservation in
in a city of predators.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.600
That's what you will learn in here.

13:48.700 --> 13:51.000
Let's meet our perpetrator.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.400
Hi

14:01.200 --> 14:03.800
No words perf
unless they're scripted.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.100
Begin scenario eight.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.300
Hey, sweet lips.

14:20.900 --> 14:23.200
Scenario 3.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.800
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.300
5.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.500
Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have
a yeast infection,

14:45.500 --> 14:47.700
and an unbelievable set of tits.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.900
For our last exercise,
I am going to demonstrate

14:56.900 --> 15:00.500
what I call, "Ocean of anger. "

15:01.000 --> 15:03.900
Hold on, because we are about to go deep.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.900
All of us as
women have developed

15:06.900 --> 15:09.800
a reservoir of resentment and anger.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.300
And these reservoirs put together
form an ocean,

15:14.500 --> 15:19.800
and this ocean is available
for all us to draw from.

15:19.800 --> 15:24.300
It holds the collective power
of every women,

15:24.300 --> 15:29.300
who has ever been wronged
in an inappropriate sexual remark

15:29.500 --> 15:33.800
being underpaid for a
job you've done better than a man,

15:34.300 --> 15:37.800
ancestor who was a slave.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.300
Or rice picker, or simply

15:43.400 --> 15:45.300
lowman on the totem pole.

15:46.300 --> 15:51.700
A husband who has wronged you,
who has cheated and lied to you,

15:51.900 --> 15:55.300
or you, or you, or you.

15:55.300 --> 15:59.100
- I'm a lesbian.
- See me after class.

15:59.100 --> 16:04.600
All of this anger is present
in all of you, right now and always.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.300
I need a volunteer.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.100
Mom!

16:14.700 --> 16:16.300
Don't!

16:21.700 --> 16:25.300
You are going to call upon this history

16:25.300 --> 16:30.100
and unleash the ocean of anger on our perf.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.000
May I, just need a quick bathroom break?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.300
Zip it, perf.
Tell him to zip it.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.800
- Zip it, perf.
- Again, good, louder.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.000
Zip it, perf.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.700
Now tell him what
you wanna tell him.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.500
Dirty little fucking scumbag.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.599
take your disease riddled whore
and fuck her in hell

17:14.599 --> 17:16.200
for all eternity,

17:16.300 --> 17:19.000
May the devil burn you,

17:19.099 --> 17:22.099
with hot jagged metal,

17:22.099 --> 17:27.000
and suffocate you with mountain fury.

17:27.099 --> 17:29.400
Now, unleash!.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.000
Oh my God.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.300
Is there a safe word I should be aware of?

17:50.600 --> 17:52.200
Time out.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.400
My life was never gonna be this way

18:18.800 --> 18:20.700
It's okay.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
I know you.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.100
I don't see how getting beat up
by a bunch of chicks everyday

18:34.200 --> 18:35.900
is getting you any closer
to the meaning of his life.

18:35.900 --> 18:39.300
I'm helping people,
I'm contributing to the world.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.400
Not like an actor.

18:42.500 --> 18:46.800
Buddy, I reflect life back unto itself, ok?

18:46.800 --> 18:51.700
Thereby, taking mirror,
like a theatre mirror.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.400
- Look at you.
- Oh, it's not as bad as it feels.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.700
My mom was sorry she beat you up so bad.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.400
Thank you, Frankie.

19:04.500 --> 19:07.500
Don't worry about it,
your mom didn't beat me up.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.800
I've been going through a lot...

19:08.800 --> 19:11.100
- Can I get a blueberry muffin...?
- Not right now sweetheart.

19:11.300 --> 19:14.700
I've been going through a lot recently
I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.700
- Don't worry about it.
- Just saying sorry.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.000
- I pick it up.
- I helped.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.000
If palm gets squeezed into it, you could die.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.000
I was wondering
if I could take you up on your offer

19:26.100 --> 19:27.600
to baby-sit.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.100
If it still holds, that is.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.600
I don't really... I mean, I haven't 
you know in a little while...

19:33.100 --> 19:35.800
I figured since they,
hired at the Women's Center,

19:35.900 --> 19:38.200
You must be trustworthy.

19:39.900 --> 19:44.700
I guess I could pop upstairs
some day after work for a couple of hours.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.600
Would Thursday work?

19:46.600 --> 19:49.200
- She has a date.
- With a big pimp.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.000
Where do you learn this stuff?

19:54.000 --> 19:58.500
Olivia at school taught me, she's
my hell, we play.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.500
What ever happened to kickball.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.300
Would 7 o'clock be okay?

20:06.900 --> 20:08.400
Oh, great.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.900
There are times when the lost
must be found,

20:16.900 --> 20:21.000
and other times when the lost
must find themselves.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.600
Very well said Rabbi.

20:22.800 --> 20:27.600
Not that he's a bad little boy
just misguided, falling in with the wrong crowd.

20:27.600 --> 20:31.700
Are you talking about me? I only hang out
with you and Dad?

20:31.700 --> 20:37.000
The battles are not only fought on
the battlefield, Roberto but also in the soul.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.200
My soul is fine. Great.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.400
What does his future hold?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
Mom, he's not a palm reader.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.500
A new job is in order.

20:47.600 --> 20:52.200
Luckily, my cousin is a head hunter
are you interested in business, Aram?

20:52.300 --> 20:54.000
Yes

20:54.100 --> 20:57.000
Kids, your babysitter's here.
Come say hello.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.100
Sadie usually goes to bed a bit later than Frankie,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.600
but due to her unscheduled
emergency surgery

21:02.600 --> 21:04.200
she'll be going to bed the same time.
 - Oh my God.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.800
Are you sure I should be staying with
 her after she just had surgery?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.300
This was her surgery.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.000
I told you it was dead
when I found it.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.600
Yes, but I highly doubt
its organs have been harvested.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.800
- I hate you.
- Can I play Wii?

21:26.900 --> 21:28.200
For half an hour.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.500
- You're gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah

21:33.500 --> 21:36.700
Truth is, I didn't know if I want to go on this date,

21:36.700 --> 21:38.800
it's just my friend, she's kinda

21:39.000 --> 21:42.100
forcing me. Things we need to get with.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.200
Release some tension.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.700
Do I look okay? Everything's in order.

21:52.700 --> 21:55.000
It seems to be.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.800
- Goodbye, Frankie.
- Bye.

22:07.700 --> 22:10.600
- Hey Frank.
- Call me Pablo.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.900
He also had some cranial seizures as well as TMJ.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.700
So what did you do?

22:18.800 --> 22:21.700
I went right home and I took out my skeleton.

22:22.200 --> 22:27.300
- Your skeleton?
- It's really as weird as it sounds.

22:27.400 --> 22:32.200
I have this bone replica skeleton, keep it the house
and I use it to figure stuff out.

22:32.900 --> 22:36.300
This way I can put it in different positions and
 see how they affect his bone structure.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.600
- It's a him?
- Yes it's him.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.500
Thought it would be weird if it was a her.

22:42.600 --> 22:46.400
That way people might think
I'm seeing somebody,

22:46.400 --> 22:50.700
and it might actually drive away
beautiful women like you.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.800
I'm a mom.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.600
Why did I say that?

22:55.600 --> 22:58.100
It's okay, it's alright, I know. It's true.

22:58.200 --> 23:03.100
You are a mom.
And you are incredibly beautiful.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.200
You have excellent posture.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.300
Excuse me for just a second.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.800
You haven't told me much about yourself. 

23:42.000 --> 23:44.100
My God.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.700
- Hello
- I'm here.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.800
I thought I'd lost you for a second.

24:00.300 --> 24:04.700
No, I grew up just outside
San Francisco.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.700
That's a great town. 

24:10.400 --> 24:12.500
Do you have any hobby? 

24:14.800 --> 24:16.500
Just take care of my kids.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.600
No, no, that's not 

24:19.700 --> 24:23.100
a hobby. 

24:26.300 --> 24:28.500
I used to like to windsurf.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.800
Longboard? Shortboard? 
Ocean, lake, what? 

24:32.300 --> 24:34.800
Lake, mostly lake.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.300
I competed when I was younger.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.000
Competed in windsurfing,
That's impressing.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.900
So?

24:51.900 --> 24:54.500
You.. like the beautiful you, you

24:57.600 --> 25:01.600
You are fascinating.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.700
What's your normal job?

25:07.800 --> 25:10.100
- I work at the coffee shop.
- I mean your real job?

25:11.000 --> 25:12.600
It was my real job.

25:12.600 --> 25:14.400
but you are in the blowup suit too.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.600
That was just once, I quit there.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.500
- Didn't you go to college?
- Yes

25:19.500 --> 25:22.200
I hope I'll have a real job
by the time I'm your age.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.400
Knockout!.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.500
The Pablo man had knocked you out.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.900
So are we gonna have fun tonight
or you're gonna be one of those boring babysitter?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.100
Hey guys, it's me.

25:34.100 --> 25:40.200
I don't know why you're not picking up,
Anyway, I hope everything's okay.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.300
Yeah, ok, bye.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.200
Worried about the kids, huh

25:54.700 --> 25:57.300
My new babysitter have not much experience yet.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.100
I know exactly what you need.

26:03.400 --> 26:06.500
See, we all hold our
tension somewhere.

26:07.100 --> 26:09.100
For you, it's in your shoulders,

26:11.900 --> 26:15.300
and just a little bit in your ass.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.100
There's much experience as I have...

26:20.100 --> 26:24.000
can tell just by the way
as people walk...

26:29.000 --> 26:31.100
and even by the way they smile.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.600
No charge.

26:47.700 --> 26:50.400
This thing got my arm.

26:52.700 --> 26:54.700
I'm running through the forest.

26:56.100 --> 26:59.900
Leave me one arm,
please don't...

27:02.100 --> 27:05.200
I'll get claustrophobic wearing human skin mask.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.500
You couldn't even wear
a hulk mask last Halloween.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.000
That's because it was hot and it smelled bad.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.500
- That was your breath, retard.
- Sadie...

27:11.500 --> 27:13.300
- Actually...
- C'mon, you don't need to do...

27:13.700 --> 27:15.000
It's 11 o'clock.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Gotta to get you to bed
before your mom comes home.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.500
- How about the "Exorcist".
- Okay.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.000
I don't feel so good.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.700
I might throw up.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.100
This chocolate bar is bigger than you

27:29.100 --> 27:31.700
If you're gonna throw up, can't we do it 
before your mom gets home, please.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.700
I always throw up when mentioning
 throw up, and before a girl.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.900
I love throw ups.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.800
- Eew, you love to eat throw up?
- Sadie.

27:38.900 --> 27:40.200
What?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.500
You're gonna freak him out
you're getting us all in trouble.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.600
You know actually I feels sick.., Frankie?

27:45.700 --> 27:47.900
- That was nice, listen
- What?.

27:47.900 --> 27:52.100
Eating a raw skinned pigeon
with mustard and rotten milk,

27:52.100 --> 27:55.500
just chewing on those intestines 
and those little bones..

27:55.700 --> 27:57.500
Okay, off to bed, c'mon... - Yummy

28:05.200 --> 28:07.300
Touch my cock.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
Stop the car.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.300
- You have a problem.
- I have a problem?

28:35.100 --> 28:37.600
Thanks for offering.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.100
I'd love to tell you.

28:44.100 --> 28:49.600
In a taxi. It seems like the perfect place.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.400
Hobby

29:04.000 --> 29:06.600
Home making.

29:10.800 --> 29:15.500
How could this happen to me?
Do you ever wonder that?

29:16.600 --> 29:19.300
How could I have floated so far

29:20.400 --> 29:25.000
off the path I thought I was on?

29:25.100 --> 29:27.900
I just thought maybe

29:29.800 --> 29:33.400
it would be some meaning to my life.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.700
I'm not making any sense.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.800
Maybe you'll come back again

29:54.800 --> 29:58.300
Cause I think the kids could really
 use some continuity.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.000
Shit.

30:05.300 --> 30:10.500
I have no fucking money. 
Can you believe that ?

30:11.500 --> 30:13.300
Can I pay you tomorrow?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.900
It's no problem.

30:24.800 --> 30:28.300
Hey it's you, eating a croissant.

30:28.900 --> 30:31.300
French chick must be fading, huh.

30:31.400 --> 30:34.100
- Don't change the music.
- What, they're shooting music.. oops?

30:35.100 --> 30:39.800
- What do you think about kids?
- I think about making them all the time.

30:40.900 --> 30:44.100
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about?

30:44.700 --> 30:49.900
- I don't know, being entirely responsible
for another human being's life.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.800
It's crazy.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.200
- Aram, aram
- Mama's dead!

30:55.400 --> 30:57.000
What? - C'mon.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.700
She's not dead.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.900
It could be postmortem twitch.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.600
Kids fall back.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.100
Hey.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.800
Sandy.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.500
It's morning.

31:37.900 --> 31:42.000
Oh my God, I slept with a babysitter.

31:43.300 --> 31:46.700
You didn't sleep with a babysitter.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.400
We thought you were dead.

31:49.300 --> 31:52.900
Yeah, we thought you might have 
asphyxiated on your own vomit

31:55.600 --> 31:58.900
Aram can take us to school.
Coz we're already late.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.700
- Could you? -Sure

32:04.800 --> 32:07.100
Can you pick them up too?

32:09.900 --> 32:12.000
Are those stat sheets ready yet?

32:12.000 --> 32:12.800
Yeah, printer 4.

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Sandy, you got a minute?

32:28.400 --> 32:29.700
Am I fired?

32:29.700 --> 32:31.800
What! Why would you say that?

32:32.700 --> 32:34.700
Because...

32:36.300 --> 32:38.400
I'm so hangover, I guess.

32:38.900 --> 32:41.300
I have two kids and no husband

32:42.400 --> 32:45.300
I haven't had a real job since 
graduate school. I'm so sorry

32:46.400 --> 32:48.400
Oh, please don't apologize.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.500
I was really calling you in to see
if you wanted to write for me.

32:52.600 --> 32:58.200
I find the guys stuff gets boring and repetitive.

32:58.200 --> 33:02.700
And I saw that stat book you put together, amazing.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.100
Clearly obsessive, reminds me of me

33:07.800 --> 33:09.600
Do you do yoga?

33:10.800 --> 33:13.000
I'll do yoga if I could win.

33:13.100 --> 33:15.300
I'm gonna take you some time.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.200
- Thanks.
- Hydrate.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.300
Cool, what's your catch phrase gonna be?

33:32.300 --> 33:34.200
I don't think it's gonna be like that, Frankie. 

33:34.200 --> 33:37.500
I'm just gonna be writing the basis of 
the story and she'll fill in the flavor.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.200
- What about suck it?
- Why are you such an idiot.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.600
It's just an idea.

33:43.300 --> 33:46.200
That's really exciting though, I mean, 
and you can even get some airtime.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.300
I don't think so. -That'll be cool, mom.

33:49.300 --> 33:51.700
You have the face for it.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.100
That's a nice thing to say.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.500
"You have the face for it. ", 
Hmm, love you, love you, love you

33:58.700 --> 34:02.200
I'm just saying that your mom has a face

34:02.500 --> 34:06.000
to put on TV.

34:07.500 --> 34:12.500
I'm very together, I never
missed taking my kids to school.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.100
You don't have to explain anything, I promise
I know what it's like to go through a divorce.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.100
Are your parents divorced?

34:20.199 --> 34:22.100
No, I am sort of.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.300
You're so young.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.000
When do you have the time?

34:27.100 --> 34:29.199
It was short-lived, her name was Alice,

34:29.400 --> 34:33.300
she left me for her brother. 
He wasn't really her brother

34:33.400 --> 34:36.900
he was just posing as her brother
 so he could be close to her

34:36.900 --> 34:38.800
So she could use me to get a green card.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.199
What!? That is horrible.

34:42.699 --> 34:46.300
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

34:46.400 --> 34:51.199
The worst part about it though
is I can't bring myself to finalize the divorce

34:51.699 --> 34:54.900
because if I do
then she'll get kick out of the country

34:55.400 --> 34:57.100
That would be so cruel, you know.

34:58.600 --> 35:02.400
God, I wished I could get my husband 
kicked out of the country.

35:03.100 --> 35:05.400
It's that bad, huh. -Yeah

35:07.300 --> 35:11.000
- So sorry.
- Oh, no, me too, for you.

35:11.400 --> 35:17.100
You know, Aram this has been really hard for me

35:17.300 --> 35:20.300
and with a new job, there's gonna 
be some longer hours.

35:20.900 --> 35:23.600
And I was thinking, maybe you'd be willing

35:23.600 --> 35:27.400
to help us out on more of a full time basis.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.600
A nanny?

35:30.600 --> 35:34.100
You're not from Trinidad, you're
from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.800
Did we send you to college for this, Harry?

35:36.300 --> 35:38.500
You always said
you just wanted me to be happy.

35:38.600 --> 35:41.800
Within reason, this is not how you 
contribute to the world.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.200
Mom you work for Ralph Lauren.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.300
People need clothes.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.100
This family needs me, she just got divorced

35:48.800 --> 35:50.900
and she got this great job

35:50.900 --> 35:53.900
and she needs someone to
trust to take care of these kids..

35:55.900 --> 35:57.900
Mom it's not like it's forever.

35:57.900 --> 35:59.500
You know, I'm gonna be making money.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.800
- Harry!
- Alright,

36:01.900 --> 36:04.800
you're still going out on interviews for other jobs.

36:04.900 --> 36:08.700
And in the meantime you can't 
keep this for quite a while.

37:44.700 --> 37:48.500
Let me try it, get a job, I'm a freaking racer.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.100
It's not the same...It's not the same thing.
Coz you have to say the freaking first to make it work.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.500
It's much funnier with the freaking, right?

37:57.100 --> 37:59.000
I'm just gonna go outside and grab a smoke.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.700
Smoke? What are they from stone age?

38:06.900 --> 38:10.800
Please for some goddamn God, 
you got to find something wrong with every guy

38:11.000 --> 38:13.600
Did you see how long it takes
the guy to order a bow wine?

38:13.700 --> 38:17.400
His father owns a vineyard
in Napa, so he knows a lot about it.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.600
Like he mentioned several hundred times.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.000
He mentioned it once.

38:21.600 --> 38:24.100
Who is calling you?
You don't have a life.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.800
It's Aram, he taught me how to text.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.700
Oh my God!
What?

38:29.700 --> 38:31.500
- You have a thing for the nanny
- Oh, please.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.400
He's just telling me that my kids are asleep.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.100
Kids asleep. Frank to

38:39.100 --> 38:41.400
Frank took two foot long poop, we measured.

38:42.100 --> 38:43.100
It's disgusting.

38:43.100 --> 38:47.200
Just keeping me in the loop and I appreciate that.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.700
It's very funny, sincere.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.900
and besides he's a lot more adult than 
those guys you've set me up with.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.300
In a 24-year old kind of way.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.500
- Let me see what you wrote.
- No, no... you're not

39:04.300 --> 39:08.900
About to bail on my date, set up monopoly?

39:08.900 --> 39:12.900
This is pathetic. Seriously?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.100
Yeah

39:19.200 --> 39:20.700
Ok, here's the pussy.

39:23.300 --> 39:28.800
I would love you to meet
Sunshine and Cinnamon.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.500
Hi, I am Aram.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.000
They love talking and stuff so...

39:35.800 --> 39:38.200
Try to be normal, alright. Stay positive.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.100
- Sorry. - Aram, hey.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.800
It's a weird name.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.000
Thank you.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.100
Mitch told me he is divorced.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.400
It's weird, huh.

39:51.900 --> 39:55.400
It's kinda normal to me, 
you know, it's my life.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.500
So I'm kinda used to it, I guess.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.700
I guess if you mean, it's unusual, then yeah.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.500
We'll talk a lot about this.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.600
I guess.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.000
I love theories.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.600
Make me a little horny.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.600
I think I'm gonna go.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.900
Hey, it's me, what are you guys doing?

40:33.900 --> 40:35.700
We're just playing "American Idol. "

40:36.300 --> 40:40.200
That was truly dreadful Aram
Finklestein, awful.

40:40.200 --> 40:44.200
You kinda like a little pitchy in the beginning
but dawg, I mean you put it together in the end,

40:44.400 --> 40:46.200
and man you rocked.

40:46.300 --> 40:50.000
Well Randy liked it, but I still don’t' think
I'm going to the next round.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.200
I'm not gonna be able to make it home for dinner tonight.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.600
Yeah, no problem.
I could feed the kids.

40:54.700 --> 40:57.000
You may have to put them to bed too.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.300
Can be a late one, huh

40:58.400 --> 41:00.400
Yeah, a couple of 
the Vikings player, 

41:00.400 --> 41:02.700
were charged of sexually assaulting a stripper

41:02.700 --> 41:05.200
I have to come up with something
 fizzy for the board to leave this. 

41:05.700 --> 41:09.200
Well, Vikings have been attacking 
people on ships for centuries now.

41:09.700 --> 41:13.100
Aram, that's good but thank you. 
I'll see when I get home okay.

41:28.700 --> 41:30.500
I'm sorry.

41:31.600 --> 41:37.500
God, I can't imagine to be many more days like this.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.900
No prob, there's dinner for you on the table there.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
Oh thanks, you didn't have to do that.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.500
Just whipped up on stuff that I learned on Top Chef

41:51.100 --> 41:54.700
The kids helped,
and Frank's pretty good.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.400
Delicious, wow, hmm... wait

41:58.900 --> 42:05.400
I have these two tickets for the fight
on Saturday, I thought you might be able to use them.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.200
Aren't the kids with their dad this weekend?

42:10.500 --> 42:13.500
- Yeah - And you don't wanna use this?

42:13.800 --> 42:17.900
My girlfriend's not free and I'm facing another date.

42:17.900 --> 42:20.100
So take whoever you want.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.000
- That's really nice, thanks.
 - You're welcome.

42:29.300 --> 42:32.300
Hey, I was wondering if you are free this weekend.

42:32.300 --> 42:33.900
Coz I've got these tickets to the big fight.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
I hate it when the ref does that.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.400
Why bother having a rest, 
just let them bare-knuckle it.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.700
I can't believe you were thinking of that coming.

43:25.800 --> 43:26.600
Me neither.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.900
I can never be like this with Frank

43:31.700 --> 43:35.900
It was like I didn't even know if 
I was happy when I was with him

43:36.800 --> 43:39.400
What makes
people do that? Just coast along.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.800
And you know the thing that really sticks for me

43:43.000 --> 43:47.100
is that I never got the chance to
tell him how I felt.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.100
He has this strange ability,

43:51.600 --> 43:54.500
to make me entirely lose my voice.

43:55.100 --> 43:57.400
Like some superpower, it's crazy.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.400
No Voice Man

44:01.400 --> 44:04.500
Steal You Voice Man, Quiet Man

44:06.000 --> 44:07.600
Dr. Silence. - That's a good one.

44:08.400 --> 44:10.500
Hey, Aram, right?

44:11.000 --> 44:13.100
Gile from Roscoe Mathis, I interviewed you.

44:13.300 --> 44:15.400
Oh, yeah yeah. How are you?

44:15.800 --> 44:21.100
Dude, you're the only person that's ever said no to us
most people would kill for that job.

44:21.700 --> 44:22.700
Sorry about that.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.200
Ringside at the fight,
doesn't look like you're doing too bad.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.700
Let me know if you ever change your mind.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.700
- Thanks. 
- Good to see you again.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.800
What?

44:38.200 --> 44:40.500
It's just an entry level thing.

44:41.200 --> 44:46.600
At Roscoe Mathis? And you
let them go to be my nanny?

44:48.100 --> 44:49.900
Idiotic.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.000
I thought so too, for a minute.

44:52.100 --> 44:56.800
I wasn't really thinking clearly there after Alice.

44:58.100 --> 45:03.600
And suddenly I just had a very clear thought in my head.

45:06.500 --> 45:09.600
What really matters are
the people in my life.

45:10.100 --> 45:15.500
You and your family were, are some of those
people that make me feel good,

45:15.600 --> 45:19.300
make my life good, every day.

45:24.300 --> 45:28.300
That is the most wonderfully

45:28.400 --> 45:31.200
and jaded naive thing I've ever heard..

45:32.600 --> 45:37.100
It's rare to find
a guy who's such a romantic.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.800
Bright light.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.000
Close those eyes.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.400
I'm not tired. 
- You're really gonna sleep this off with me.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.300
I'm gonna put this here okay.

46:26.700 --> 46:28.100
I really love your kids.

46:29.200 --> 46:30.600
I know.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.000
I had fun tonight.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.400
Yeah... me too.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.900
None of you to call me that word, okay.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.100
It's not a weird word, though
It's just means a "female dog"..

46:50.300 --> 46:52.700
I'm not gonna have semantics today, okay. 
- What are you doing here?

46:52.700 --> 46:56.200
You know what it means, it's not okay to call
 me that or anyone else for that matter

46:56.400 --> 46:58.500
You've been in the city for a few months
they're already totally corrupted.

46:58.800 --> 47:02.200
- Dad's play sucks.
- Frankie, what happened?

47:02.200 --> 47:04.900
- Aram!?
- Guys, careful...

47:05.200 --> 47:07.900
C'mon you late night criminals

47:11.400 --> 47:14.100
Hey, guess what? -You wanna give me a million dollars?

47:14.100 --> 47:15.600
We saw a dead junk on the road.

47:15.800 --> 47:16.900
Oh, even better.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.600
We wanted to touch it but dad wouldn't let us.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.900
You're running a home for delinquent boys.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.500
Aram helps me with the kids, Frank.

47:26.100 --> 47:28.200
The kids weren't here, so what's he doing here?

47:28.200 --> 47:30.500
Can I just explain something to you?

47:30.800 --> 47:33.500
You have no
rights in this house, okay.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.500
I don't like the way this separation is going.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.300
Oh Really?

47:38.800 --> 47:43.300
Well, I'm loving the way it's going, 
this is exactly how I envisioned my life.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.300
- Noticed how weird this thing was.
- That's mine.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.900
What I wanna say, it's gonna come out wrong.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.300
I want you back. I want our life back.

47:52.700 --> 47:54.300
Why are you doing this?

47:54.600 --> 47:58.100
The truth is I couldn't handle the kids,
 I just wanted to see you.

47:59.100 --> 48:02.000
You must missed me, at least a little.

48:04.500 --> 48:06.100
I don't want you here.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.300
Of course, I don't wanna be here.

48:10.200 --> 48:13.200
If you're good, I'll come back and do the grunge.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.100
You can even work if you wanted to.

48:25.100 --> 48:26.600
Part time.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.300
Imagine this..

48:32.900 --> 48:37.500
There are so many things
I wanted to say to you.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.800
We're not gonna need you anymore.

48:44.800 --> 48:47.700
Unless you wanna grab a bite to eat and
 you can sit, are you on hourly?

48:47.700 --> 48:51.200
I think Sandy had something that 
she wanted to say to you.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.000
Didn't you?

49:04.500 --> 49:09.900
I just wanted to tell you about some
 feelings I've been having

49:13.300 --> 49:14.700
you know

49:16.700 --> 49:19.300
regarding you and your treatment with me.

49:23.300 --> 49:25.500
What she wanted to say was...

49:25.700 --> 49:30.800
and, this is pretty much, 
word for word, if I remember properly

49:31.300 --> 49:35.400
that you're a dirty little fucking scumbag

49:36.000 --> 49:40.800
and I might be paraphrasing here, but you should

49:40.900 --> 49:46.300
take your diseased riddled whore and 
fuck her in hell for all eternity.

49:46.500 --> 49:47.800
While the devil burns you...

49:48.800 --> 49:52.000
with hot jagged metal and suffocates you

49:53.100 --> 49:54.500
with molten fury.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.000
Fucking nutheads.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.300
Don't come beg me to come back.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.600
This was the last straw.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.700
That was really good.

50:19.100 --> 50:22.800
And by the way, I never loved you.

50:23.400 --> 50:26.000
And I'm changing our son's name to Pablo

50:26.500 --> 50:28.800
so I'm never have to be remembered of you.

50:29.700 --> 50:31.800
And stuck at your little bitch.

50:37.100 --> 50:39.200
You are off tomorrow, come take me out.

50:41.300 --> 50:43.700
Dude, back in the saddle!

50:43.800 --> 50:46.100
Who's the unsuspecting lovely lady?

50:47.500 --> 50:49.100
- Her name? -Yes

50:50.000 --> 50:53.200
The thing that you will be calling out in bed.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.100
if she's all upon you...

50:59.500 --> 51:00.900
Sandy

51:02.400 --> 51:04.200
It's your boss' name, isn't it?

51:05.100 --> 51:08.000
Wait a minute, are you
gonna date your boss?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.100
Oh that's hot.

51:12.300 --> 51:14.100
Oh, wait no, she's like 60 though, I thought.

51:14.300 --> 51:15.600
She's 40.

51:16.300 --> 51:17.900
But she got like a hundred kids though.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.300
Two

51:20.500 --> 51:24.100
So, when's this all going down?

51:24.900 --> 51:27.000
Actually, tonight.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.200
Dude...

51:31.300 --> 51:33.400
tonight's my showcase.

51:33.800 --> 51:35.800
I sent you a postcard.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.800
Right. It's just that she already hired another babysitter.

51:43.100 --> 51:50.500
Work's been really busy so finding another
 time would be virtually impossible.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.200
You'll understand.

51:52.900 --> 51:59.600
Welcome one and all to the second annual
 Holligan theater, group showcase workshop

51:59.600 --> 52:04.800
I am your host, actor, director,
 choreographer, Magnus Croom

52:05.400 --> 52:06.900
Thank you.

52:10.900 --> 52:13.000
You are about to see 46

52:13.900 --> 52:20.000
of the most daring
the most empathetic beings in this out fair city.

52:20.300 --> 52:26.600
offering to you, performances from their
 favorite works of stage and screens.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.600
Please keep your seats throughout.

52:28.900 --> 52:33.700
for there will be no intermission.
Thank you and let the magic begin.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.700
Stella!

52:43.400 --> 52:47.900
Stella!

52:48.400 --> 52:49.800
To be..

52:51.900 --> 52:53.200
or not be.

52:54.500 --> 52:56.000
That is the question

52:56.700 --> 52:58.500
Whether it is nobler

52:58.700 --> 53:04.500
in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

53:17.000 --> 53:18.700
There he is.

53:25.500 --> 53:26.800
I had him in view.

53:26.900 --> 53:29.100
I was feeling over the edge into a dive.

53:30.400 --> 53:34.300
He saw me when I moved in for the kill.

53:34.500 --> 53:38.900
Is that how you remember it, Maverick?

53:38.900 --> 53:43.000
- Is this Top Gun?
- Not pretty sure.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.300
The rules of engagement
are not flexible, Maverick.

53:48.200 --> 53:53.800
They are there for your safety
you will obey them, is that clear?

53:53.800 --> 53:55.600
Maverick!

53:55.900 --> 53:57.500
Yes, sir, very clear.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.000
I guess we...

53:59.600 --> 54:01.000
I...

54:01.500 --> 54:03.300
was just a little over enthusiastic.

54:03.300 --> 54:05.800
I guess you were...

54:10.000 --> 54:11.300
Platoon!

54:14.300 --> 54:15.700
Platoon!

54:21.900 --> 54:26.700
Hey, oh bro, I'm so glad you made it.

54:28.000 --> 54:31.700
I made it... I'm here.

54:33.300 --> 54:35.400
.. saw the whole thing.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.800
Even your part.

54:40.100 --> 54:42.800
Was that Top Gun? -You know it was.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.500
We thought you were really great.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.500
I loved your postmodern take on the whole thing

54:53.500 --> 54:58.900
and it was creative how you acknowledged how definitive it was.

55:01.700 --> 55:03.300
Thank you.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.700
Thank you so much.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.700
I told you guys...

55:11.300 --> 55:13.600
I told you people would get it.

55:14.600 --> 55:16.800
You gotta go party with us.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.400
I guess in a tree house.

55:39.600 --> 55:41.400
Outdoor shower.

55:43.900 --> 55:46.900
Refrigerator -In a refrigerator?

55:47.200 --> 55:48.700
All over it.

55:49.400 --> 55:52.000
In the display case of the coffee shop where I work.

55:56.700 --> 55:58.200
Don't do that..

56:07.100 --> 56:08.900
The craziest place

56:10.100 --> 56:11.400
I have to say...

56:11.800 --> 56:14.700
on the surfboard, in the ocean.

56:19.800 --> 56:21.400
Sesha buche.

56:28.300 --> 56:30.000
It's really romantic.

57:12.200 --> 57:13.900
Hello, Aram.

57:14.900 --> 57:17.900
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.

57:19.400 --> 57:21.100
Hi, Alice.

57:23.200 --> 57:27.000
I have regrets about, you know, how I broke up with you

57:28.200 --> 57:31.200
I found I have this problem with sex

57:31.600 --> 57:38.100
because I just use it to get what I want and
 I really think that's what I did with you.

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
I would love to meet with you,

57:44.500 --> 57:50.400
so we can talk and make some apologies to you.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.400
- Amends?
- Yes, amends.

57:56.500 --> 57:57.800
I'm really sorry.

57:58.900 --> 58:04.000
You know, I should get going.
 I don't wanna keep my sister waiting.

58:04.200 --> 58:05.600
What?

58:16.500 --> 58:18.100
I'm so hot.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.200
So? It was...

58:47.300 --> 58:48.700
Long.

58:48.800 --> 58:52.100
I know, I think that you went to a hotel or something.

58:52.100 --> 58:53.300
Oh please.

58:56.300 --> 58:59.300
Honey, what's with your hair?

58:59.500 --> 59:00.800
What?

59:04.200 --> 59:05.600
Okay, fine.

59:07.300 --> 59:10.200
It was awkward and cute and tedious.

59:11.100 --> 59:13.000
Did you just say cute and tedious?

59:13.200 --> 59:16.300
I mean he's a kid and it was tedious.

59:16.700 --> 59:18.500
Sounds like you didn't give him a chance.

59:18.900 --> 59:23.300
- Did you even kiss those young, soft lips?
- We didn't get there.

59:23.600 --> 59:28.100
We went to his friend's acting showcase
 and to this after party at The Loft

59:28.200 --> 59:29.600
Acting showcase?

59:29.600 --> 59:31.700
But now I need a bath.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.900
Alright. My God

59:36.600 --> 59:38.000
What?

59:39.700 --> 59:41.900
Thanks for babysitting.

59:41.900 --> 59:43.400
Okay.

59:43.800 --> 59:47.000
- Sorry you couldn't get laid.
- Shut up.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.300
Tedious. -Just to get rid of her.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.400
It was or it wasn't it?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.900
Oh wait a minute, not quite so much tongue.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.900
Oh, God.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.600
That's gross.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.500
- Oh shit.
- Oh, God.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.100
Frank? What are you doing up?

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.100
Was Aram peeing on you?

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.600
No!

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.500
I would never do that.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.800
Okay, are you sleeping over?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.100
- No.
- No.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.900
- No?
- Oh, well.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.700
Don't forget your pants.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.300
- So does that mean you and mom are gonna have a baby?
- No!

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.400
I don't get it you said that sperm makes a baby.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.800
Sperm. and it does.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:14.900
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.400
I like your mother and I
think she likes me,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.600
and it's all that's important.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600
You also work for her.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.300
- Who's turn is it?
- Mine.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.900
Okay.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:34.300
C’mon Frankie, let's get off the doughnuts.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
How is that possible?

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.000
So you like mom.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.400
- Are you two gonna date now?
- I don't know.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.700
You don't really know anything, do you?

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.000
- I mean she's kind of your girlfriend.
- Are you gonna be our new dad?

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.000
- and you'll also be our nanny?
- Yeah, and what do we call you?

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.100
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to supreme court here guys,
I just had sex with your mother.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.300
When I say sex,
I, I mean that I gave her

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.100
a nice massage.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.700
With sperm.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:15.200
Oh, you conniving little liar. Oh is he
hiding in the hall?

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.000
My God, he was.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.200
- It sounds so dirty.
- Dirty?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.700
Ok, it's a little dirty

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.200
Well you got that out of your system. Now you're free to meet your next real guy.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.300
What does that mean?

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:36.400
What, it means now when you meet a viable man
he won't have to be your rebound.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.400
Coz your nanny was your rebound.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.100
Gives you pleasure to say that, doesn't it?

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.600
I'm not sure of buying
that "The Rebound" thing.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.200
Oh what, you're gonna date the nanny?

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.700
Was having one night stand with a nanny more dignified?

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.200
No, just more practical

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.800
Wait a minute.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.000
You actually have feelings for this kid?

01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.900
Feelings? I have feelings
for everyone.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.300
That's the way the world works.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.300
God, you're in serious justification mode.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.300
Why do you have to be so cynical?

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.900
I mean, I don't judge your
blatant disregard's recycling.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:19.300
This is not about judgment. This is about my friend.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:22.200
and what is realistic and what is not realistic for her.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:25.400
It's about me not wanting to see you get hurt.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.000
Happy birthday... -Thank you.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.800
1, 2, 3...

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.400
We get it.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.000
You need anything?

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.100
Stop it.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.600
Okay.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.500
So did Aram tell you about this operation I'm having?

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.700
- Harry?
- No.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.800
They're gonna give me a new asshole.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.100
There are children here.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.200
- Cool, like from a dead guy?
- Sadie.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.900
I think they're gonna have just passion,
one out of something.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.900
Hopefully, it's something elastic.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:11.100
Awesome.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.200
Excuse me.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.700
This is so... weird.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.900
My dad telling you about his surgery?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.800
Yeah.. I didn't know they can even do that.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
You look really pretty..

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.300
No, no...

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.300
- We are in your parent's house
- I know.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.500
Where is everybody?

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.300
Just a little red, I don't think it's trapped.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.000
Cake time.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:01.200
This one is just from me.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.400
Gummy bears and hand lotion.

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:10.700
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.700
Please. Open your mother's.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.300
- No, no, he'll open yours.
- You're his mother.

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.900
Well, you're his employer. I insist.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.000
You'll love it.

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.100
It's not fake poop, is it?

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.500
- No.
- That's for Christmas.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.100
Oh, you have Christmas.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400
What do we got here.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.200
A human totem pole.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.700
Gotta get you up here next time

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.000
I don't think so.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.400
This is great, thank you so much.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:57.700
- Good.
- This is perfect.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.200
Thanks Mom.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.700
- That was just from me.
- So nice.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.200
Where did you get these butterflies?

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:14.200
My grandmother gave that to my father and
I think it's time for you to have that.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:28.900
The message applies all these years later.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.500
Mother's love can never be replaced.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.300
- Never.
- Never.

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.800
Thanks, Mom.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.700
It's antique.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.400
- Whoa, that's cool
- Beautiful.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.500
- I might throw up.
- What's the chances?

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:54.300
60-40

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.200
Which direction?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.600
70-30. now.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:09.200
At least you're, we're in your percentages.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.700
Sing me a song.

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:16.300
No, you go to bed.

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.100
Sing me a song, or I'll blow up on you.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.700
When you put it that way.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.700
Let's see what I have in my repertoire.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.800
Blow up.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.200
Stay tonight.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:47.800
Two Months Later

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:52.000
Are we sure this guy is real? 
I mean, has anybody met him?

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.300
He has no time to meet us, 
he has high school and all that homework...

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.500
Isn't he in a baseball team?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.300
He's just running a little late.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.100
Well, he's definitely responsible for 
an attitude change, because you

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.399
well, you can't just stop smiling.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:08.899
- She's glowing.
- Well, he's doing something right.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.500
I am sorry I'm late.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:16.800
Babysitter needs to be walked through everything.

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:19.399
Hi.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:20.800
I'm Aram.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.700
Sorry, this is Aram.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.600
Would you like a coke or something?

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.100
- Scott.
- I'll take some wine..

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.500
So Aram, I've heard a lot about you.

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:37.399
I hope all good things.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:41.399
That you're wonderful with children,
that you're a great cook...

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:44.700
that you were born in 1983.

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.899
Jesus! I was pregnant
in 1983.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:53.100
Let's just go on and get it out on the table, get it out
 in the open so we can enjoy our dinner.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.400
Yes, I was born in the early 80s.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.000
She also told me that you were very handsome
 and that seems to be true.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.300
I think that it's great you guys are together.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.100
In the words of The Bart:

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.800
"The heart wants what it wants. "

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.600
You are so gay.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.300
Sir, are you ready?

01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.900
I can be.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.800
Scott, right? Do you mind if I borrow your glasses?

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.300
You know, I’m just kidding, I'm just
25 years, I don't need reading glasses.

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.400
Don't you wanna

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.900
travel around the world, you know

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:44.700
get crazy, rock Cleveland

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.600
do things that people
your age supposed to do?

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.100
Rock Cleveland?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.000
Yeah, rock it.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:00.200
Live.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.200
To tell you the truth this is 
the most alive I've ever felt.

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:07.100
You're too so goddamn romantic.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.100
What about kids? Kids of your own..

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.100
It's not like you're 50.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:17.200
But I'm an old 40.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.100
What the hell does that mean?

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:21.500
I'm wrinkling.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.700
You have no wrinkles on your face, do you?

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:29.000
You seem to have eyes, something 
that I really love about you.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.400
I love you.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:38.100
and when you compliment me I love it,
 when you compliment me.

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.600
You know, I heard you the first time.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.700
I have no idea what you were preferring to.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.500
- No? You said I love you.
- I didn't say that.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.300
I'm pretty sure you did.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.500
And I love you too.

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.700
Really?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.300
Sorry, but I do.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.600
Just... take it slowly.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.800
Slowly.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.000
Teram Owens, the man who wore baggage than
 a first class passenger on the Titanic

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.300
Reaching but funny.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.000
T.O. the pig fan of the National Football League

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.000
wherever he goes he is surrounded by distinct controversy.

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.100
I like it.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.600
Sex really agrees with your creative side.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.000
Are you alright, sweetie? You look pale.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.600
No, I'm just dizzy from following you around.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.100
Well, get that to me, please.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.300
Right away.

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.100
Alright.

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:08.800
It helps me think.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.000
We should talk.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.000
I knew this was coming.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:36.800
You think that books that I read are too juvenile.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.400
I know, it's just I've always liked this stuff..

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.200
I'm pregnant.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.500
But...

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.000
I pull out most of the time.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:55.400
I know you're not ready for this, 
just wanted to let you know that

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.800
I feel the same way from you...

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:04.100
I just thought that you wanted to take things slowly.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.300
I did.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.100
This is...

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.000
big.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.300
Very... big.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.300
I should've been more careful.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.600
I know this sounds crazy

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.900
but I think I wanted this to happen.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.400
What?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
You said it yourself you don't wanna just coast

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.400
not just coast along but this isn't coasting.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.500
This is a roller coasting.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:50.000
Oh, my God.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.900
Not Oh God... this is a good thing,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.800
not the roller coasting thing, that was cheesy but...

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.300
having a baby with you that's not cheesy.

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.100
I mean... that's not what I'm saying just...

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.400
excited, I wanna be your father.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.300
What?

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:14.900
No, I wanna be a father with you as the mother,
that's the important part.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.300
You being a mother.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800
You know, I thought, I hope that kid is like you

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.500
I hope the kid's like you.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.000
A girl with brown eyes...

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:29.700
or a boy with brown eyes...

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.600
or just any color eyes

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.100
Well, it's not the baby's head, not your size.

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.500
What about Gium?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.300
For a boy.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.300
Gium Finklestein?

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.800
Okay.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.700
What about Ira?

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.000
The doctor will see you now.

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.700
Great.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.000
Okay so...

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:18.700
So?

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.400
The blood work is normal.

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.300
In other words, your are healthy.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:27.500
And that is always a good sign for future pregnancy.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.600
What do you mean future?

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.800
I mean, this here is what we call an ectopic pregnancy.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.900
There are any number explanations for this,
it's not necessarily because of your age.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:42.800
God.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.300
This is something that happens
periodically.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:49.600
An embryo was formed but it intruded inside the fallopian tube

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.100
instead of the uterus.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.700
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy...

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.200
This was crazy.

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:17.100
I mean, what were we thinking, anyway?

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:21.200
You are so young.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.800
God!

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:26.100
You live at your parent's house and
technically you work for me

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.400
and I was thinking about having your baby?

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.800
What is going on?

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.500
So you have to know?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.000
Can we just find out?

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.500
That is a deceivingly mature thing to say.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.100
Why is it deceiving?

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:41.200
Because you're 25 years old...

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.300
you get drunk off half a beer

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.000
and you read the Harry Potter series in your spare time.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.000
A lot of adult read those books.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.800
And besides the way I remembered it, 
you're the one that asked me out

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.100
I appreciate that you feel this could work

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.300
more than you'll ever know.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.500
You were such a good person

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.700
real special person,

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.600
I mean not filing a divorce so your
horrible ex-wife can get a green card

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:13.900
What'd be the point?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.500
See, that's what I mean, someone like you
shouldn't be with someone like me.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.900
An old girlfriend with two kids.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.200
You're an ageist...

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.100
Yeah, yeah... I'm an old ageist.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.800
Oh please, don't patronize me.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.100
I may live with my parents and get drunk off half a beer

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:37.100
and yeah, I admit to being slightly adrift as far in my life

01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:38.800
but I'm not a complete idiot...

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.100
I know how I feel about you.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.700
It's you that doesn't know
how you feel about me.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.600
I just wish you had the guts to say it.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.000
You've meant so much to me and my family

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:58.000
but this doesn't make sense.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.800
And what future can we possibly have?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.300
You know what I'm gonna miss the most?

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:15.500
It's you...

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:18.700
Your friendship.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.000
Go! 

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.900
Graduating Class of 2012. 

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.500
- Sadie Pageant and Sadie also received
 the award for best science project

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:08.600
We need to say a special thanks to you
for bringing us into you homes,

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.800
but most of all to those unsung fanatics.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:14.300
- Who make us look good.
- Yeah, we do look good.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.900
- I'm Laura Riley.
- And I'm Scott Reynolds,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.800
TMI coming at you next.

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:25.200
Sandy, you got a minute?

01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:32.200
Hello.. hello.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.300
Hello people.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.700
Our illustrious leader, Ken Gordon,
has an announcement to make.

01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.100
Although change can be
painful, change can also be a good thing

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.300
a necessary step in the evolution of
a company, a family like ours...

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.000
From the beginning of time 
all the way till today 

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.700
there are certain things that
you'll always find.

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:03.200
Now, if you look at the pictures, can anyone see
what they all have in common?

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.300
- Liv
- There are people in all of them.

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:08.800
Exactly, great answer.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.600
so almost everywhere you go in the world
you're gonna find these little communities of people

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.000
just like you guys
you guys are a community...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.500
your class, your family...

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.600
I just came back from Mozambique.

01:25:19.800 --> 01:25:22.900
Okay. - I've been to the Non Talking Film Festival.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.800
Aram?

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.500
You're the only one who gets
gifts from the kids at the end of every tour.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:40.800
That's probably because
they're so excited, the tour is over.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.100
Good to see you.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.000
I was gonna go get a drink,
You wanna join me?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.500
You know what I actually...

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:51.700
Have plans already...

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.600
I do.

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.900
You're impossible.

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.100
I've heard that before.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.100
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, have a good night.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.900
Here's to your mother... the newest and undoubtedly 
most qualified anchor of the network, very deserving. 

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:14.300
Thank you.

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.500
- Congratulations Mom.
- Thanks.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:21.300
I know your own show is big step up
but I'll miss you.

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:26.800
I will be one studio over,
and I'll come in guesting.

01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.800
I'm gonna hold you to that.

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:33.100
Gotta use the ladies' room

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.100
then we could stuff our faces.

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.900
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:48.800
Hi

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.500
Hi

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.000
- How are you?
- How are you?

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:03.700
You first.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.400
I'm good, yeah good

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.900
Kids are great...

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.200
I just got promoted

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.900
I'm gonna start anchoring.

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:18.100
I watched you on TV, it's fantastic.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.600
But that's not a surprise.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.600
You look really good.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.600
I'm 30.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.200
I'm sorry about.. you know.. things

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.400
Don't even...

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:43.000
it was just timely.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:47.500
Traveled around the world.

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:50.100
- Oh you did?
- Never rocked the Cleveland.

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.800
but some pretty amazing things happened.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.700
Dad, I told you I could do it myself.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.800
I knew I could do it yourself. 
I bumped into a friend of mine.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.800
Sandy... I want
you to meet my son, Zeke.

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.000
I met him in Bangladesh
and we kinda fell in love with each other.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:13.900
It took a couple of years,
but now I'm his dad.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:15.800
Hi

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:18.100
Hi, I'm Zeke Finklestein.

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:19.800
You are huh?

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.200
I'm Sandy.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:23.300
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:31.200
God, I bet you're an amazing dad.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:33.900
And his mom?

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.200
Just me and Zeke, it's hard to find someone
that's good enough for us.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.000
Right?

01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.900
And what about you? Boyfriend?

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:52.900
Dating... wasn't
my thing... I discovered.

01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.000
That's too bad.

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.300
Would you like to join us?

01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.900
The kids would be thrilled.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.800
I'm with my parents...

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.600
Oh, you had me so worried, did you fall in?

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.100
Mom, you remember Sandy?

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:13.300
How could I forget?
You talk about her everyday.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.000
I was just saying to Aram, you know, if he wants to join us

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:22.200
Oh are you kidding, we would love to,
we would love to!

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:24.700
Harry, get up, we're moving.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:25.900
I didn't do anything.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.900
I didn't say you did anything
I said we're moving tables..

01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.100
- Look who I just bumped into.
- Oh my God!

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.000
Look at how huge are,
you, you look like you're 13..

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.200
- I am.
- What?

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.800
I want you guys to meet someone,
this is my son Zeke.

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:54.100
- You wanna play gameboy?
- Yeah, go ahead... take a seat.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.300
Nice to see you. It's been years. -Yeah

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.800
We all get older and
you stay the same.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.900
Hello. -Hi

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.000
What a surprise.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.200
You remember us, do you?

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.700
You came to our house, remember?

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:20.800
