- No, it's a real gun! No!

02:47.467 --> 02:49.958
Okay, Mr. Monk, really.
You don't have to wash 'em.

02:50.036 --> 02:54.166
They're just gonna get recycled.
They're just gonna get
all smushed together.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.970
You may be right.
This one's still sticky.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.034

Hello.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.472
Mr. Monk-

03:34.881 --> 03:37.782
There's someone here to see you.
She says she's an old friend.

SherryJudd?
[Can Clatters]

03:40.420 --> 03:42.354
Sherry?

03:42.422 --> 03:45.914
Sh- She's here?
What does she want?
I don't know.

03:45.992 --> 03:48.392
Who is she?

03:48.461 --> 03:50.895
Someone I knew
in the eighth grade.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.898
Is she here to apologize?

03:54.200 --> 03:57.328
I don't know.
Well, tell her
it's too little too late.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.238
No, wait! Uh-

04:02.308 --> 04:05.903
Tell her about Trudy.
Tell her I married Trudy.

04:05.979 --> 04:08.447
Tell her Trudy loved me.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.278
Tell her how pretty Trudy was.

04:11.351 --> 04:14.115
Uh, wait.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.245
Tell her Trudy and I
went all the way.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.258
Mr. Monk, I think
she needs your help.

04:25.331 --> 04:27.765
With her homework?
No.

04:27.834 --> 04:31.031
With a case.
We're all... grown-up now.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.937
Oh, yeah. Right.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.714
Uh, Sherry?

04:44.884 --> 04:49.617
Hello. It's-
I'm Adrian... Monk.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.782
Adrian.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.224
Oh. You-You look great.

04:56.062 --> 04:59.725
Um, y-you probably don't
even remember me.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.668
Is that Trudy?

05:03.736 --> 05:05.704
She was beautiful.

05:05.772 --> 05:08.570
Um, Natalie told me
what happened.
I'm- I'm so sorry.

05:08.641 --> 05:11.701
Thank you.
We went all the way.

05:11.778 --> 05:14.372
Please. Won't you have a seat?

05:14.447 --> 05:17.211
Can I offer you anything?

05:17.283 --> 05:19.717
Um, we have
bottled water and, uh-

05:19.786 --> 05:21.720
Pushin' the bottled water.

05:21.788 --> 05:25.918
I'm fine, thanks.
Um, where to begin?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.325
Uh, I've been living in Seattle.
Um, we just moved back
three years ago.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.329
We?
<i>My husband and I.</i>

05:31.397 --> 05:33.456
- Ah.
- Michael.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.501
Um, we're recently divorced.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.729
Oh!
I'm so sorry.

05:37.804 --> 05:41.763
No, no, it's- it's-
It's for the best, believe me.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.868
So, it's, uh, just been me
and my housekeeper, Gladys.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.879
That's why I'm here.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.711
<i>Sunday night, someone broke in.</i>

05:50.783 --> 05:53.946
<i>I guess Gladys woke up.</i>
<i>Um, there must have been a fight.</i>

05:56.489 --> 05:58.548
And, um,

05:58.624 --> 06:00.558
they killed her.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.060
Oh-
Oh, my God.

06:04.330 --> 06:08.767
Are you okay?
No- I wasn't home.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.794
Adrian, I'm the only family
Gladys had.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.364
I just want justice, for her.

06:16.442 --> 06:21.277
L- I wanna make sure that
the best people are working on this.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.475
And l-I've been asking around,
and everyone says you're a genius.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.044
But, of course,
I already knew that.

06:30.523 --> 06:34.391
Adrian, um, helped me
out of a jam when we were kids.

06:34.460 --> 06:39.261
- Oh.
- About, uh, what?
Thirty years ago?

06:39.332 --> 06:42.426
April 12, 1972.
You remember?

06:42.502 --> 06:44.493
I only remember the date.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.538
And what everybody wore.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.097
And what everybody said,
and what everybody did.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.803
Here it is.
WestoverJunior High, 1972.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.812
Natalie, don't-
don't open that!

06:53.880 --> 06:56.110
Natalie, put that back.
I command you.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.786
<i>[Gasps]</i>
<i>Sherry, you were so cute.</i>

07:00.853 --> 07:03.151
Okay, now where is Mr. Monk?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.747
Natalie!
Just close the book!
I mean it.

07:05.825 --> 07:09.625
Natalie. Natalie.
Okay, that's it. You're fired.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.686
[Gasps]
She's fired.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.095
No, that couldn't be me.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.796
It says "Adrian Monk."
[Laughs]

07:17.870 --> 07:20.134
Oh! Oh.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.834
Oh-

07:34.220 --> 07:36.450
Adrian!

07:41.093 --> 07:43.527
Mom, everyone's watching.

07:43.596 --> 07:46.827
Here's your lunch.
It's cut into 10 little squares,
just the way we like it.

07:46.899 --> 07:50.391
And your first aid kit.
And your toiletry bag.
Mom-

07:50.470 --> 07:53.371
You'll thank me later.
Remember, don't share
your food with anyone.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.875
Sit near the fire doors.
I'll pick you up at 3:04.
I'll be wearing an orange blouse.

07:56.943 --> 08:00.003
Mom, I know what you look like.
I'll be fine.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.809
I love you, Mom.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.544
What are you doing?
Right, sorry.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.151
<i>Here he comes. He's like</i>
<i>the real-life Eddie Munster.</i>

08:15.228 --> 08:18.322
He can hear you.
He won't even know
what it means.

08:18.397 --> 08:20.388
I heard they don't
even have a TV.

08:20.466 --> 08:22.593
<i>I heard his brother never</i>
<i>comes out of the house.</i>

08:22.668 --> 08:26.434
<i>I heard they have to</i>
<i>memorize the dictionary,</i>
<i>one letter per month.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:29.236
I heard that they take
four showers a day.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.681
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>

08:51.831 --> 08:53.765
[Softly]
Excuse me.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.970
Oh. Hi, Sherry.

08:58.037 --> 09:02.474
I, uh, wanted to thank you
for recommending that
rock-and-roll record.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.705
It was very... groovy.
I didn't
recommend anything.

09:05.778 --> 09:09.179
Yes, you did. You were
wearing a Led Zeppelin
T-shirt yesterday,

09:09.248 --> 09:11.808
which is the same thing
as recommending them.

09:11.884 --> 09:15.513
[Clears Throat]
So, uh, I went out,
and I bought their record.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.421
The, uh, "Stairway Up To Heaven"?

09:18.491 --> 09:21.688
What did you think?

09:21.761 --> 09:25.663
Well, you know, I haven't
actually listened to it yet.
We don't have a record player.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.892
I assume it's excellent.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.697
I mean, uh, groovy.

09:30.770 --> 09:35.036
Yes, you can tell from the cover.
They look so... groovy.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.803
Well, I gotta go.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.811
You always turn
your lock back to zero.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.575
I noticed that. I do that too.
So later it's easier to open.

09:42.648 --> 09:46.243
Uh-huh.
Actually, there are a lot of
things we have in common.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.454
"Things Adrian Monk
and SherryJudd have in common."

09:52.525 --> 09:56.586
You made a list?
"One, our lockers
are right next to each other.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.823
Two, we both like
<i>The Patty Duke Show.</i>"

09:58.898 --> 10:02.265
Even though she has to be lying,
because they're supposed
to be identical cousins,

10:02.335 --> 10:04.428
which is
biologically impossible.

10:04.503 --> 10:07.097
"Three, perfect attendance records."

10:07.173 --> 10:11.132
And, uh, four-
[Exhales]

10:11.210 --> 10:13.440
"Neither of us has a date
to the Spring Fling."

10:13.512 --> 10:15.343
How do you know that?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.474
I happened to catch a glimpse
of your weekly planner,

10:18.551 --> 10:23.386
and I noticed that you have
a babysitting job lined up
for that evening.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.892
Unless I'm wrong,
which, you know, I'm not.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.950
Hey, Sher.
Hey, Jimmy.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.292
Hey, I'm goin' to art class.
You wanna be my model?

10:31.364 --> 10:34.458
Yeah. Cool.
Good-bye, Adrian.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.338
Bye.

10:45.011 --> 10:48.412
Yes, I will help you.

11:01.093 --> 11:04.221
What was he like
as a kid?

11:04.296 --> 11:07.595
Uh, pretty much the same.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.000
Careful. Smart.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.937
Sad.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.236
L- I don't think
people change really.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.640
At least, I've never seen it.

11:18.711 --> 11:22.044
I waited 10 years for
my husband to change.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.180
Mr. Monk?

11:27.853 --> 11:29.787
Mr. Monk?

11:31.257 --> 11:33.191
Mr. Monk.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.887
Let's- Let's come over here.

11:50.109 --> 11:54.409
Strange. Fingerprints
but no palm prints.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.960
There were two of them.

12:11.764 --> 12:15.632
Housekeeper surprised them.

12:15.701 --> 12:17.965
There was a struggle.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.232
She pushes the alarm,

12:20.306 --> 12:22.706
she hits her head
and falls here.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.216
This painting-

12:42.328 --> 12:44.262
Is it valuable?

12:44.330 --> 12:47.424
Not really, except to me.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.491
It's my great-grandmother.

12:51.070 --> 12:53.129
Why would someone
do something like that?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.974
Did you have spray paint
in the house?

12:57.042 --> 13:00.443
No.
So they must've
brought it with them.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.216
Thank you.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.713
This is the housekeeper's blood.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.824
So, they defaced the painting
after they killed her,

13:17.897 --> 13:20.695
after the alarm sounded.

13:20.766 --> 13:24.793
They risked everything,
they risked life in prison...

13:25.905 --> 13:28.032
to deface
your great-grandmother?

13:31.577 --> 13:35.673
I think that's why
they were here- to do this.

13:36.715 --> 13:39.479
To draw glasses and a mustache?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.577
And a little goatee.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.763
She was your
great-grandmother?

13:53.265 --> 13:56.564
Tell me about her.
Well, I never met her.

13:56.635 --> 14:00.662
She was a famous
suffragette. Went to jail
for the right to vote.

14:00.739 --> 14:04.175
Maybe they were
making a statement.
You know, like a political thing.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.447
You mean, they broke into the house,
and they beat a woman to death,

14:10.516 --> 14:14.418
then defaced the painting
because they had trouble
with the 19th Amendment?

14:14.486 --> 14:16.420
Yes.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.252
I mean, no.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.520
It's a mystery.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.602
Okay.
It's my house.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.896
Sherry.
Michael?

14:33.973 --> 14:36.601
How did-
How did you get in?

14:36.675 --> 14:40.304
It's still my house, Sherry.
At least, uh, technically.
That is not true.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.145
You can't just come over, Michael.
It's- It's in the agreement.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.411
It was on the news.
I had to come!

14:46.485 --> 14:48.578
<i>I'm sorry about Gladys.</i>
<i>L</i>- <i>l</i>- <i>I really am.</i>

14:48.654 --> 14:51.452
Are you okay?
Were you here?

14:51.523 --> 14:53.582
I was in San Diego,
visiting my sister.

14:53.659 --> 14:56.594
Ah, that's right.
I knew that.
Um,

14:56.662 --> 15:01.099
Captain Stottlemeyer,
this is my ex-husband,
Michael Norfleet.

15:01.166 --> 15:04.932
Yes. We've already
spoken to Mr. Norfleet.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.165
Adrian Monk
and Natalie Teeger.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.141
Monk? From junior high?

15:10.209 --> 15:13.144
That's right.
Sherry told me all about you.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.578
About how you never
took a single gym class.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.884
I had a note.

15:20.953 --> 15:22.750
[Chuckles]

15:22.821 --> 15:25.255
<i>Oh, my God.!</i>

15:25.324 --> 15:28.225
They did that too?
Animals. Did-
Did they take anything?

15:28.294 --> 15:31.923
Michael, please, just leave.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.928
Sir, she asked you to leave.

15:40.472 --> 15:43.441
Yes, okay, I'm going.

15:43.509 --> 15:48.276
But before I do-
Figured I'd save myself a stamp.

15:48.347 --> 15:51.339
Here ya go.
Your monthly pound of flesh.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.385
Mail it next time.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.545
I'll pay for the stamp.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.988
Yeah, well,
good luck on this.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.693
See ya around.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.430
Thank you.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.711
How much do we have?

16:22.114 --> 16:24.582
[Coins Rattling]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.641
$18.25.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.047
[Chuckles]
How do you do that?

16:30.122 --> 16:32.056
I don't know.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.221
[Chuckles]
It's kind of funny
raising money for a dance...

16:36.295 --> 16:38.559
that neither of us
is going to.

16:40.232 --> 16:44.225
<i>Uh, Leo, here's the thing</i>- 
<i>You gotta pay for that.</i>

16:48.073 --> 16:51.531
Mmm. Pay for what?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.544
Where's your evidence, Columbo?

16:53.612 --> 16:55.546
Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket.
I'm not kidding.

16:55.614 --> 16:59.050
You don't wanna do that, Sherry.
You'll be sorry. I mean it.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.544
Are you gonna pay us or not?

17:04.623 --> 17:06.590
Hmm.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.961
[Gasps]
[Laughing]

17:14.032 --> 17:16.558
Leo, I'm telling.
I'm serious.

17:16.635 --> 17:19.934
Here. It's okay.
It's only chocolate.

17:20.005 --> 17:23.805
Here.
Thanks.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.970
You should
carry these with you.

17:29.648 --> 17:33.140
Now, that's a list of people
that have worked at her house
over the past year.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.709
Do you recognize anybody?
No.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.983
Neither do we.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.187
Monk, Natalie and Sherry
are downstairs waitin' for ya.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.526
Oh, yeah.
They're taking the painting
to the museum.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.828
A guy named James Duffy
works there as a restoration expert.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.835
What, you're going with?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.837
Yeah.
Well, keep your eyes open.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.305
What? What do you mean?
It's just that your friend SherryJudd...

17:55.374 --> 17:58.036
just got a homeowner's policy
worth a million dollars two weeks ago.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.044
That's pretty convenient,
isn't it?

18:00.112 --> 18:03.081
Well, that's ridiculous.
Y-You think she did it herself
for the insurance?

18:03.148 --> 18:06.640
No, no. She was in San Diego
like she said, but she could've
hired somebody.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.777
No!
No?

18:08.854 --> 18:10.947
Well, she doesn't need the money.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.924
I got a look at that alimony check.
She's getting 20 grand a month.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.960
That's a lot of dough.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.053
Thank you.
But, Monk,

18:18.130 --> 18:22.965
you and I have put enough
rich people in jail to know that
a lot of dough is never enough.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.765
They always want more.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.966
Not Sherry.
You don't know her.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.807
What?

18:33.879 --> 18:38.009
It's just that I haven't heard you
talk about a woman like this...

18:38.083 --> 18:40.017
for a long time.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.625
<i>[Sherry]</i>
<i>How did you get</i>
<i>all that chocolate out?</i>

18:50.696 --> 18:53.494
My mom makes me keep
a backup shirt in my locker.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.527
[Exhales]
Listen, Sherry.
[Clears Throat]

18:59.538 --> 19:02.974
I, uh- I really like you-
<i>Hey, Judd.</i>

19:03.041 --> 19:06.238
Here. Let me help.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.245
What are you doing?

19:08.313 --> 19:11.043
Mr. Thicket said I have to act
more like a gentleman.

19:11.116 --> 19:15.576
He said that just before
he gave me two weeks' detention.
Thanks for ratting me out.

19:15.654 --> 19:21.058
Well, you know, Leo, you were
stealing from the decorating
committee. Man.

19:21.126 --> 19:24.527
Which means that you were really
stealing from everybody.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.497
Relax, Charlie Brown.
I learned a lesson.
I'll never steal again.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.434
For example, I'll never do this.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.563
Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine.
Would you please give it back?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.234
And I would never, ever
dip this into the toilet.
Please, not the toilet.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.675
Not the toilet.
Come on, Leo.
Be cool, man.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.576
This is none of
your business, Jimmy.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.514
I'm just sayin' there's already
enough bad vibes in the world.

19:44.583 --> 19:46.551
We don't have to add to it.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.416
Come on. Give it back.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.422
What would MickJagger do?

19:53.125 --> 19:55.116
<i>He'd give it back,</i>
<i>wouldn't he?</i>

19:56.495 --> 20:00.261
Here.
This isn't over.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.098
So, what's the name
of that dance?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.228
The Spring Fling.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.172
It sounds stupid,

20:09.241 --> 20:12.176
but if you wanna go, I'll go.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.643
Yeah. That'd be cool.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.647
<i>[Bell Rings]</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:28.121
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>

20:28.193 --> 20:31.094
Are you sure? Because I could
get Natalie to carry it.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.092
Hello. We have
an appointment with,

20:35.167 --> 20:38.603
um, James Duffy,
Art Restoration?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.900
Sure. He'll meet you
in the main gallery.
Thank you.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.273
Mr. Monk.

20:44.343 --> 20:46.277
Mr. Monk, can I
give you some advice?
Yeah.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.779
And I'm only saying this
to you as a friend.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.839
As someone who's dated.
A lot.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.818
What?
Some wine spilled.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.821
Where?
Over there.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.119
It's a painting.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.285
It's driving me a little crazy.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.488
Then don't look at it.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.396
Okay, it's about Sherry.
I've been watching you,
and l-

21:07.466 --> 21:09.559
I can't not look.

21:11.970 --> 21:15.804
Maybe they could fix it. This guy
we're seeing restores art, right?
Mr. Monk-

21:15.874 --> 21:18.604
Maybe he could just
paint over it.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.475
- Turn that a little-
- Forget about the painting!

21:21.546 --> 21:24.811
I think you should ask her out.
Take her to dinner.

21:24.883 --> 21:27.443
Sherry? No.
No, I can't.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.987
Yes, you can.
I know you want to.

21:30.055 --> 21:33.149
I do?
Yes, you want to.
Trust me on this.

21:33.225 --> 21:35.659
What about Trudy?
I'm a married man.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.855
Oh, Mr. Monk,
it's... not really a date.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.160
You're old friends, right?
You're just catching up.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.167
Mr. Monk, she likes you.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.328
No. There's no way.

21:45.404 --> 21:47.338
Why not?
She knows me.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.340
Just think about this
for one second.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.309
There are over 200
private detectives in this city.

21:52.377 --> 21:54.845
But she came to you,
didn't she?

21:57.282 --> 21:59.216
She likes you.

22:04.356 --> 22:06.483
I'm not gonna
ask you again, Miss Judd.

22:06.558 --> 22:08.992
I want you to open that locker.
This is crazy!

22:09.061 --> 22:12.030
Principal Thicket,
I didn't take anything.
Open the locker.

22:16.735 --> 22:20.000
- What's going on?
- Somebody stole
the bake sale money.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.199
Mr. Thicket got
an anonymous note.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.710
Whoever wrote it said they saw
the money in Sherry's locker.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.079
That's impossible.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.750
<i>[Murmuring]</i>

22:32.818 --> 22:35.343
L-That's not mine.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.217
<i>That's not mine.</i>

22:37.289 --> 22:39.280
How did that get in there?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.726
Where's the money, Sherry?
I don't know. I swear.
I didn't take it.

22:43.795 --> 22:47.356
Well, how did this get in there?
Does anyone else know
your combination?

22:47.432 --> 22:50.299
No.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.303
Let's go.
To my office.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.669
I think we need to
talk to your parents.
Back to class.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.970
Everybody,
back to class!

23:17.028 --> 23:20.429
I love this one.
Look at their faces.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.763
I wonder what they're thinking.

23:22.834 --> 23:25.496
She's planning to murder him.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.973
What?
She's about to feed him
amanita mushrooms.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.566
<i>You can tell by</i>
<i>the little white spots.</i>

23:32.644 --> 23:34.908
<i>It's a deadly poison.</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:38.074
Well, maybe she doesn't know.
Oh, she knows.

23:38.150 --> 23:41.278
He's been hitting her.
She's swollen.

23:41.353 --> 23:44.186
<i>See the bruises on her arms</i>
<i>and her left eye?</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:46.349
She knows what she's doing.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.625
Must be hard...

23:52.697 --> 23:55.996
to be you,
to see everything.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.503
It's awful.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.313
Sherry-
Mm-hmm?

24:09.381 --> 24:11.611
I was wondering-

24:11.683 --> 24:14.811
Later, uh, when
we're done here,

24:14.886 --> 24:19.653
if you're not too busy,

<i>You know</i>-

They're helping me out.
I've just had a terrible week.

25:07.272 --> 25:10.332
Somebody broke into my house,
my housekeeper was killed.

25:10.408 --> 25:13.275
I heard about that.
I am so sorry.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.973
- I didn't realize that was you.
- Oh, well, it's confusing.

Divorced. You know,
a lot of that goin' around.

25:23.788 --> 25:27.087
Oh, and you changed
your name?
My mother remarried when I was 15.

Oh!
You-

25:29.494 --> 25:31.428
You really look great.

from tie-dyeing T-shirts.

Oh, I still do that
on the weekends too.
Don't tell anybody.

It was in your parents'
dining room.

<i>Uh, is there anything peculiar</i>
<i>about that spray paint?</i>

Uh, I'll have to run some tests.
But it feels like an oil-based
spray enamel.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.294
You can get it at any
hardware store.

26:06.364 --> 26:10.960
<i>So, uh, what do you think, Doc?</i>
<i>Is she gonna make it?</i>

26:11.036 --> 26:13.971

The honor student, SherryJudd.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.920
"Yes, I will go out with you,"

28:52.997 --> 28:54.988
as she wrote her phone number
on his hand...

28:55.066 --> 28:58.502

- <i>Yeah, so?</i>
- No fingers.

29:10.148 --> 29:13.606
You remember the handprint
on Sherry's wall?

29:16.020 --> 29:18.488
They were bikers?

29:18.556 --> 29:20.490

29:27.198 --> 29:30.167
Yeah.
Cross-checked it against
registered motorcycle owners.

29:30.235 --> 29:32.226
We got two hits.

29:32.303 --> 29:35.101
Well, good. Let's take one,
give one to Monk.
Yes, sir, which one?

29:35.173 --> 29:36.970
Doesn't matter.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.334
Oh.

Why don't we leave?
No, Mr. Monk.
I'm fine.

30:14.412 --> 30:20.373
Okay. But, uh, if you get uncomfortable,
you let me know, and we just leave.
Okay.

30:20.451 --> 30:24.387
But w-w-wait. Or if you feel
like you're about to
get uncomfortable-

30:24.455 --> 30:27.151
Mr. Monk, why don't we call the captain?
Just let him handle this.
No.

30:27.225 --> 30:30.956
No, no.
We can do this.

Nobody.

Sherry.
No. Natalie,
I'm a private detective.

30:42.073 --> 30:45.474
This is what I do.
I don't care what SherryJudd
thinks of me.

30:45.543 --> 30:48.376
She's just a girl who
sat behind me in homeroom.

30:48.446 --> 30:51.540
Hey.
You alone?

30:51.616 --> 30:55.518
No. I'm with him.
So you're alone.

30:55.587 --> 30:59.148

32:03.988 --> 32:05.922
<i>You took the money</i>

Hey. They found
the empty cash box, remember?

32:11.562 --> 32:14.190
It was in your

Which was locked.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.961
- You framed her.
- How?

Tell me. She's the only one

- You're the guy.
- I'm the guy.

Nah, he'll get over it.

He said he solved the case.

Oh, good!

Ah, you fixed it.

<i>Sir, sir.</i>
<i>Please don't touch that.</i>
<i>That's evidence.</i>

35:41.739 --> 35:43.866
W- Evidence of what?

35:43.941 --> 35:47.240
Mr. Norfleet, you're under arrest
for the murder of Gladys Aquino,

35:47.311 --> 35:49.245
your wife's housekeeper.

35:49.313 --> 35:52.578
Son, this'll be a lot easier
on everyone if you just confess.

35:52.650 --> 35:55.585
I know you took the money.
That's crazy.
It was in her locker.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.587
<i>Nobody else</i>
<i>could've opened it.</i>

35:57.655 --> 36:00.818
The cash box was in her locker
because you put it there.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.087
And I know how you did it.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.562
Here's what happened.
You hired two men,
Travis Baptiste and his brother,

36:06.631 --> 36:08.690
to break in to Sherry's house.

36:08.766 --> 36:11.929
- Ridiculous.
- We found this in Travis's wallet.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.437
Anyone could've written that.

36:14.505 --> 36:18.464
It's true. The letters are printed.
There's nothing special about them.

36:18.543 --> 36:20.773
But look at the house number.
Look at the zero.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.075
There's a little line through it.

36:23.147 --> 36:25.081
<i>I noticed something yesterday...</i>

36:25.149 --> 36:27.208
when you were stuffing me
into my locker,

36:27.285 --> 36:30.015
<i>which, by the way,</i>
<i>wasn't very cool.</i>

36:30.087 --> 36:33.056
My lock was set to zero.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.888
I remembered that Sherry
always set her lock to zero as well.

36:37.094 --> 36:41.394
<i>But the day before,</i>
<i>when Principal Thicket</i>
<i>found the cash box,</i>

36:41.465 --> 36:43.558
<i>her lock was not set to zero.</i>

36:43.634 --> 36:46.762
<i>This was all about the zeros.</i>

36:46.837 --> 36:52.139
You don't see a zero
written like this very often,
but I saw four of them.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.737
<i>The day before, when you were</i>
<i>writing Sherry's alimony check.</i>

36:55.813 --> 36:57.747
I've seen other people
write zeros like that.

36:57.815 --> 37:03.082
True, but how many of them
also know the floor plan
to your wife's house?

37:03.154 --> 37:06.817
Here's what happened.
When you pretended to
help her with her books,

37:06.891 --> 37:09.155
<i>you pocketed her lock</i>
<i>and replaced it with yours.</i>

37:09.227 --> 37:12.060
It was a perfect plan.

37:12.129 --> 37:15.098
<i>You took out the money.</i>
<i>Then, when nobody was watching,</i>

37:15.166 --> 37:18.135
<i>you came back</i>
<i>and planted the cash box.</i>

37:18.202 --> 37:20.636
<i>Then you put her lock</i>
<i>back on the locker.</i>

37:20.705 --> 37:23.105
Why would I hire somebody
to break into her house?

37:23.174 --> 37:26.337
- There's nothing
in there that I want.
- <i>[Monk] Ah, yes.</i>

37:26.410 --> 37:29.971
The motive.
I knew it had something
to do with this painting,

37:30.047 --> 37:32.845
but I just couldn't
figure out what.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.944
Then, I remembered
how you resented
paying all that alimony.

37:37.021 --> 37:40.354
I believe you called it
"your monthly pound of flesh."

37:40.424 --> 37:42.358
Her alimony?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.360
<i>You'd be paying her</i>
<i>alimony forever,</i>

37:44.428 --> 37:47.295
unless she got remarried.

37:47.365 --> 37:50.857
This wasn't about
stealing anything,
or hurting anybody.

37:51.869 --> 37:56.636
This was about them.
You were fixing them up.

37:56.707 --> 38:00.541
He knew aboutJimmy.
I talked about him all the time.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.171
You tracked him down.
And you got lucky.

38:03.247 --> 38:06.341
He was single
and still living right here
in the city.

38:06.417 --> 38:10.478
<i>[Monk] But you had a problem.</i>
<i>How were you gonna</i>
<i>get them together?</i>

38:10.554 --> 38:12.488
You couldn't just call her.

38:12.556 --> 38:14.717
You and Sherry
were barely speaking.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.023
And she would have resented
any suggestion you made.

38:18.095 --> 38:22.191
<i>So you played Cupid.</i>
<i>You hired Travis and his brother...</i>

38:22.266 --> 38:25.064
<i>to break in to her house</i>
<i>and to deface the painting,</i>

38:25.136 --> 38:27.195
a painting she loved-

38:27.271 --> 38:30.399
one you knew
she would want restored.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.908
You were betting that
eventually she'd bring it toJames.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.241
<i>He is the best</i>
<i>art restorer in the city.</i>

38:36.480 --> 38:40.746
They would discover
that they still had feelings
for each other.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.611
And you were right.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.690
Nice story.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.919
You can't prove any of it.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.928
You can't prove any of this!

38:51.996 --> 38:54.487
Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk?
He's a freak. Ask anybody.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.556
Let's empty out
all your pockets. Come on.

38:58.936 --> 39:01.496
That's my money.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.837
<i>Travis and George werejust</i>
<i>picked up this morning in Las Vegas.</i>

39:06.911 --> 39:09.436
And these boys are gonna talk.
I could promise you that.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.811
Their fingerprints
were all over that room.

39:14.318 --> 39:17.185
This money's from the bake sale.

39:17.254 --> 39:19.950
That's my handwriting.
I wrote "good luck"...

next to "Honest Abe" Lincoln.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.127
Why don't you and I
have a little talk in my office?

39:26.197 --> 39:29.189
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

39:29.266 --> 39:32.201
Nobody was supposed
to get hurt.

39:32.269 --> 39:35.705
What was Gladys doing there?
It was supposed to be her day off.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.775
Lieutenant Disher,
book him.

39:39.844 --> 39:43.575
The crazy thing is,
it worked.
