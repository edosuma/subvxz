00:54.739 --> 00:58.741
<i>It was
in all the papers at the time.</i>

00:58.743 --> 01:03.715
<i>Men searching in the Arctic
had found a yellow metal.</i>

01:05.049 --> 01:06.516
<i>Gold.</i>

01:07.617 --> 01:12.688
<i>A mad fever spread
as far as word can travel</i>

01:12.690 --> 01:17.895
<i>and thousands more rushed to
the North to try their luck.</i>

01:19.396 --> 01:21.864
<i>These men needed dogs.</i>

01:21.866 --> 01:26.436
<i>Big dogs with strong muscles
to pull their sleds.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:31.639
Good morning there, Buck!

01:31.641 --> 01:34.210
<i>Buck
was neither house dog</i>

01:34.212 --> 01:35.343
<i>nor kennel dog.</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:36.712
Here you go, boy.

01:36.714 --> 01:39.247
<i>His master
was Santa Clara County judge.</i>

01:39.249 --> 01:40.548
Hey!

01:40.550 --> 01:43.418
Whoa! Watch it, you!

01:43.420 --> 01:46.958
<i>In this
realm, Buck was king.</i>

01:48.025 --> 01:49.225
Damn it, creature!

01:49.227 --> 01:51.426
Careful!
That's Judge Miller's dog.

01:51.428 --> 01:53.394
You wish the judge
a happy birthday from me.

01:53.396 --> 01:55.164
Thanks, will do.
Come on, Buck! Let's go.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.464
News of the Klondike!

01:56.466 --> 01:59.168
Thousands of gold rushers
converge in Dawson City!

01:59.170 --> 02:00.970
News of the Klondike! Oh.

02:00.972 --> 02:02.671
Here you go, lad.

02:04.641 --> 02:05.975
Buck, stop!

02:05.977 --> 02:07.042
Buck!

02:07.044 --> 02:08.110
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

02:08.112 --> 02:09.344
Buck!

02:09.346 --> 02:11.346
- Get! Stop it.
- Come here!

02:11.348 --> 02:12.948
Lady,
call your dog! Look out!

02:12.950 --> 02:14.484
Buck! Come here!

02:15.219 --> 02:16.451
Out of the way!

02:16.453 --> 02:18.756
Come back here
right now! Buck! Stop!

02:22.660 --> 02:23.694
Buck.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.462
No!
I'm so, so sorry!

02:27.464 --> 02:29.732
I'm sorry.
That dog's a menace.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.700
Oh, he's just spoiled.

02:31.702 --> 02:33.635
Buck means well.

02:33.637 --> 02:34.536
Usually.

02:34.538 --> 02:36.672
Abigail, cook needs you.

02:36.674 --> 02:37.973
Buck.

02:37.975 --> 02:39.342
Go wake the girls.

02:57.862 --> 02:59.596
Oh.

03:06.938 --> 03:09.372
Grab the roast!

03:11.275 --> 03:13.110
Uh... I'll look out!

03:23.221 --> 03:25.422
Out!

03:51.048 --> 03:51.914
No.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.883
Remember we talked
about this, Buck.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.252
Today you need to be
on your best behavior.

03:58.122 --> 03:59.757
Buck?

04:15.940 --> 04:17.740
Hmm.

04:17.742 --> 04:18.674
Your Honor.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.877
Smells very, very good.

04:21.879 --> 04:23.679
Happy birthday.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.247
Everyone over here first.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.863
All right, Molly.
You look beautiful.

04:40.865 --> 04:42.599
All right. Settle.

04:53.110 --> 04:55.079
Buck.

05:25.376 --> 05:27.678
Why don't you
sit out here

05:28.578 --> 05:31.716
and you think
on what you've done.

05:35.186 --> 05:37.121
No. Not now, Buck.

06:00.978 --> 06:03.312
<i>This wasn't the first night</i>

06:03.314 --> 06:05.280
<i>Buck spent on the porch.</i>

06:13.257 --> 06:14.859
Come on, Buck.
Come on.

06:18.696 --> 06:20.462
<i>He was less attentive</i>

06:20.464 --> 06:22.865
<i>to his master's commands...</i>

06:22.867 --> 06:24.967
Hey, Buck.
I got a treat for ya.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.535
<i>...than he was
to his own instincts.</i>

06:27.537 --> 06:28.773
Come on.

06:29.539 --> 06:31.175
Get the treat. Come on!

06:32.043 --> 06:33.108
Good boy.

06:33.110 --> 06:34.575
Good boy.

06:34.577 --> 06:36.680
Get the treat.
Get the treat.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.619
Good boy. Good boy!

06:50.061 --> 06:52.494
He answers
to the name of Buck.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.765
He'll fetch a fine price
where he's going.

07:15.186 --> 07:16.218
Hold up!

07:16.220 --> 07:19.223
I'll need extra hands
for this last transfer.

07:25.463 --> 07:28.063
What in the world
is in this thing?

07:28.065 --> 07:29.198
Dog.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.499
How many?

07:30.501 --> 07:31.667
Just one.

08:11.942 --> 08:13.709
<i>Locked in that box...</i>

08:15.980 --> 08:19.383
<i>...he couldn't eat,
drink, or sleep.</i>

08:20.885 --> 08:23.787
<i>Buck had no idea
where he was,</i>

08:25.256 --> 08:26.991
<i>where he had been,</i>

08:27.725 --> 08:29.860
<i>where he was going.</i>

08:50.681 --> 08:51.949
Easy, boy.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.985
All you have to do

08:56.987 --> 08:58.789
is sit.

09:13.003 --> 09:15.306
This ain't
the Southland anymore.

09:17.107 --> 09:18.307
Go on.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.009
See it.

09:21.011 --> 09:22.813
See it, boy.

09:23.914 --> 09:26.784
It's the law of the land now.

09:27.251 --> 09:29.787
The law of club

09:30.421 --> 09:32.089
and fang.

09:33.791 --> 09:35.859
No one above it.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.964
Now what's it
gonna be, doggy?

09:48.539 --> 09:50.040
Good.

09:50.474 --> 09:51.842
Good.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.278
You a fast learner.

10:09.694 --> 10:11.126
<i>Buck stood no chance</i>

10:11.128 --> 10:13.764
<i>against a man with a club.</i>

10:15.734 --> 10:17.768
<i>He knew that.</i>

10:18.569 --> 10:20.004
<i>He was beaten.</i>

10:24.642 --> 10:26.908
<i>But he was not broken.</i>

10:45.462 --> 10:46.463
Hey!

10:48.499 --> 10:50.868
Come on!

11:15.059 --> 11:17.127
<i>Skagway, Alaska.</i>

11:17.729 --> 11:19.863
<i>Gateway to the Yukon.</i>

11:20.497 --> 11:22.799
<i>The edge of nowhere.</i>

11:22.801 --> 11:27.169
<i>Most anyone looking for gold
went through here first.</i>

11:27.171 --> 11:29.604
All right,
let's go, let's go.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.039
There you go.

11:33.077 --> 11:34.543
Get your caribou stew!
Right there.

11:34.545 --> 11:37.112
<i>Buck was
a long way from home.</i>

11:38.515 --> 11:42.117
Do you betray our Lord
for your lust of gold?

11:42.119 --> 11:43.552
Don't mind them.
Come on.

11:43.554 --> 11:45.022
No. This way. This way.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.324
Come on! Move.

11:49.326 --> 11:52.096
There you go. Come on.
Come on.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.236
Come on now, buddy.

12:01.238 --> 12:03.240
It's just snow, Buck.
Come on.

12:25.629 --> 12:27.564
Hey! Buck, come on!

12:28.733 --> 12:29.933
Get over here!

12:31.935 --> 12:33.137
Buck!

12:40.511 --> 12:41.878
All right.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.313
That's it.

12:43.981 --> 12:45.614
The house is hers?

12:45.616 --> 12:48.519
Yes, sir. The house
and everything in it.

12:49.319 --> 12:50.753
That's good.

12:50.755 --> 12:52.421
She deserves it.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.389
All aboard!

12:54.391 --> 12:56.759
Not much luck up there
this last year.

12:56.761 --> 12:58.093
Seems more folks coming back

12:58.095 --> 13:00.097
pockets empty
than full of gold.

13:01.131 --> 13:03.100
I'm not looking for gold.

13:21.118 --> 13:23.487
Hey! Jeez...

13:31.495 --> 13:32.697
Watch yourself.

13:42.139 --> 13:46.241
Last boat
to Dawson leaving now!

13:46.243 --> 13:48.510
Miss it,
it's only sleds till spring.

13:57.922 --> 13:59.454
That's mine.

13:59.456 --> 14:01.757
Hey! Thanks.

14:01.759 --> 14:02.959
Buck!

14:02.961 --> 14:04.526
Got ya.

14:04.528 --> 14:05.996
Buck's his name?

14:06.630 --> 14:07.697
Come on, let's go.

14:07.699 --> 14:08.764
Thanks, Buck.

14:08.766 --> 14:10.565
You're a fast one.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.169
All right. This way.

14:19.543 --> 14:20.509
Good morning.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.611
Perrault!
Been a long time.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.679
Good to see you.

14:23.681 --> 14:24.847
How've you been?

14:24.849 --> 14:26.214
Good, good.

14:26.216 --> 14:28.049
So, telegraph
hasn't put the mail service

14:28.051 --> 14:29.484
out of business yet?

14:29.486 --> 14:30.385
Not yet.

14:30.387 --> 14:32.356
I need two dogs
for my team.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.953
You wanna go?

15:03.955 --> 15:05.422
Don't wait for me!

15:23.775 --> 15:25.309
<i>Bonjour,</i> Francoise!

15:29.279 --> 15:31.783
What have you done now?

15:34.852 --> 15:36.788
This is Buck.

15:37.889 --> 15:40.490
Two. We needed two.

15:41.726 --> 15:43.625
What? He's big.

15:43.627 --> 15:44.593
Too big.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.261
- He'll never make it.
- He'll make it.

15:46.263 --> 15:48.496
What do you know? Aah.

15:48.498 --> 15:50.632
Okay, let's you
meet the team.

15:50.634 --> 15:53.002
Buck, meet Spitz.

15:53.004 --> 15:55.170
Your new boss.

15:55.172 --> 15:56.839
Stay out of his way.

15:58.910 --> 16:00.277
That's Dolly.

16:00.745 --> 16:02.110
Pike.

16:02.112 --> 16:03.545
Jo.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.548
Billie.

16:04.983 --> 16:06.183
Dub.

16:06.784 --> 16:07.885
Dave.

16:08.653 --> 16:10.185
And Sol-leks.

16:10.187 --> 16:11.889
You are here.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.594
Welcome to the team.

16:19.196 --> 16:22.197
We have a new route,
so everyone pay attention.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.801
You, too, Dave.
We are here.

16:25.803 --> 16:31.208
We deliver mail 500 miles
all the way to here.

16:31.541 --> 16:32.742
Dawson.

16:32.744 --> 16:34.309
They don't understand you.

16:34.311 --> 16:38.080
Buck, just do
what Spitz does. Okay?

16:38.082 --> 16:39.884
He leads, you follow.

16:53.898 --> 16:55.165
Team, ready?

16:56.067 --> 16:58.801
Remember, we don't
just carry the mail,

16:58.803 --> 17:00.535
we carry lives!

17:00.537 --> 17:02.907
And, mush!

17:06.543 --> 17:08.309
Come on, mush!

17:14.018 --> 17:15.352
<i>Allez!</i>

17:18.555 --> 17:19.689
<i>Allez!</i>

17:33.771 --> 17:35.738
Spitz! Gee!

17:43.815 --> 17:45.883
Whoa! Whoa!

17:58.029 --> 17:59.360
See, Buck?

17:59.362 --> 18:00.796
Now all our fates are one.

18:00.798 --> 18:03.331
They're dogs!
They don't understand.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.900
Oh, yes, he does.

18:04.902 --> 18:05.801
Oh, yes.

18:05.803 --> 18:09.471
Buck, we're all
tied up together now.

18:09.473 --> 18:11.473
We fall all together,

18:11.475 --> 18:13.678
but so do we get up as one.

18:15.747 --> 18:17.782
Come. We try again.

18:18.883 --> 18:19.984
Easy.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.385
That's it, Spitz.

18:29.426 --> 18:31.093
I think
your dog is broken.

18:31.095 --> 18:32.327
He's not broken.

18:32.329 --> 18:33.931
He's just got
Californian feet.

18:53.316 --> 18:57.287
<i>Out here,
under an open sky...</i>

18:58.421 --> 19:02.325
<i>Buck felt a cold
he'd never known.</i>

19:19.243 --> 19:20.610
Out!

19:21.846 --> 19:24.379
Dogs sleep outside!

19:32.556 --> 19:35.523
<i>Growing up
in the world of man...</i>

19:35.525 --> 19:39.096
<i>Buck had learned
to listen to their voices.</i>

19:44.367 --> 19:45.736
<i>Tonight,</i>

19:46.804 --> 19:49.774
<i>he would begin
to hear his own.</i>

20:35.086 --> 20:36.051
Come on, Buck!

20:36.053 --> 20:38.087
We have to get on the day.

20:38.089 --> 20:39.522
<i>Allez!</i>

20:56.874 --> 20:57.875
On by!

20:58.743 --> 20:59.744
Mail!

21:02.046 --> 21:03.114
Thanks, Perrault.

21:05.816 --> 21:08.451
- Mail!
- Thank you!

21:55.299 --> 21:56.633
That's better!

21:59.971 --> 22:02.073
You are a heavy one.

22:37.108 --> 22:38.876
Spitz! Gee!

22:39.609 --> 22:42.179
Yeah! That's a turn!

22:42.880 --> 22:44.849
You see?
He learns quick.

22:52.990 --> 22:55.590
<i>Doing
the work of a sled dog</i>

22:55.592 --> 22:59.661
<i>brought Buck confidence
and joy.</i>

22:59.663 --> 23:03.834
<i>Now, he belonged to a pack.</i>

23:05.669 --> 23:06.871
Gee!

23:07.972 --> 23:09.604
Yeah, that's it!

23:09.606 --> 23:11.108
<i>Fantastique!</i>

23:11.909 --> 23:14.779
You're a real sled dog
now, Buck!

23:36.967 --> 23:37.968
Hold up.

23:39.036 --> 23:40.637
Buck, stay.

23:49.713 --> 23:51.648
No, no, no! Francoise!

23:55.653 --> 23:56.887
Francoise!

24:11.435 --> 24:12.770
Francoise!

24:41.999 --> 24:43.499
Francoise!

24:49.573 --> 24:50.774
You okay?

24:51.442 --> 24:52.843
Buck!

24:55.513 --> 24:56.578
Buck!

24:56.580 --> 24:58.480
Save him!

24:58.482 --> 24:59.683
Buck!

25:06.323 --> 25:07.858
Buck!

25:08.792 --> 25:10.227
Buck!

25:11.028 --> 25:12.029
Buck!

25:17.234 --> 25:19.101
Buck!

25:22.373 --> 25:24.108
Buck!

25:24.441 --> 25:25.507
Buck!

25:27.478 --> 25:28.879
Buck.

25:33.717 --> 25:35.786
Buck.

25:48.933 --> 25:49.934
Buck.

25:58.776 --> 25:59.977
Oh, Buck.

26:01.378 --> 26:02.846
Oh, Buck.

26:06.917 --> 26:09.320
Crying for a dog.

26:10.921 --> 26:12.754
No.

26:12.756 --> 26:15.859
No, no.
I wasn't crying.

26:18.295 --> 26:19.296
You were crying.

26:22.366 --> 26:23.367
No.

26:24.635 --> 26:26.368
I wasn't.

26:31.175 --> 26:34.176
In all his years
hauling the mail...

26:34.178 --> 26:37.112
Perrault has never
been on time.

26:37.114 --> 26:38.749
Not once.

26:40.017 --> 26:43.454
But he drives every day
like it might happen.

26:44.355 --> 26:46.755
He believes.

26:46.757 --> 26:49.224
But I never saw him
believe in anything

26:49.226 --> 26:51.996
as much as
he believes in you.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.110
Now I do, too.

28:26.924 --> 28:31.895
<i>A pack
can have only one leader.</i>

28:32.896 --> 28:36.400
<i>Spitz had had enough.</i>

32:20.223 --> 32:22.092
Spitz!

32:24.261 --> 32:26.764
Spitz!

32:29.067 --> 32:31.533
Spitz! Spitz!

32:33.037 --> 32:35.236
It's not like him.

32:35.238 --> 32:36.973
I looked all morning.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.508
I can't find him anywhere.

32:39.509 --> 32:41.578
It's like he's vanished.

32:44.348 --> 32:45.382
Spitz!

32:46.450 --> 32:49.184
We have to go.
Without him.

32:49.186 --> 32:50.688
Can't lose the day.

32:51.622 --> 32:53.557
Sol-leks! Oh.

32:54.124 --> 32:56.794
Buck? Back in place.

32:57.695 --> 32:58.627
<i>Allez!</i>

32:58.629 --> 33:01.630
Sol-leks has got
more than five years on you.

33:01.632 --> 33:02.834
Get in line.

33:05.670 --> 33:07.103
Ooh.

33:07.105 --> 33:09.237
Buck.

33:09.239 --> 33:11.907
Just because you pull good
don't make you ready to lead.

33:11.909 --> 33:13.577
Okay? <i>Allez.</i>

33:18.783 --> 33:20.983
I don't think
he's gonna move.

33:20.985 --> 33:22.552
Oh, he'll move.

33:23.121 --> 33:24.421
Buck...

33:25.589 --> 33:26.691
Move.

33:34.832 --> 33:35.931
Sol-leks, come.

33:35.933 --> 33:36.934
Come.

33:37.567 --> 33:39.937
<i>Allez!</i>

33:40.905 --> 33:41.971
Here.

33:46.343 --> 33:49.045
Hey. Come here.

33:49.047 --> 33:51.613
Hey.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.181
What got into this dog
this morning?

33:53.183 --> 33:54.315
No. Hey.

33:54.317 --> 33:55.818
I think they know something
you don't know.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.853
There's nothing I don't know.

33:57.855 --> 33:59.387
Hey. Where did he go? Hey!

33:59.389 --> 34:01.322
We can't make up
this much time.

34:01.324 --> 34:02.825
They'll close the office.

34:02.827 --> 34:03.828
No!

34:04.162 --> 34:05.226
No!

34:05.228 --> 34:06.561
No, no, no, no, no!

34:06.563 --> 34:08.229
We were going
to be on time.

34:08.231 --> 34:09.765
Just once!

34:23.848 --> 34:24.849
Fine.

34:30.554 --> 34:31.555
Take it.

35:10.627 --> 35:13.195
It's not that bad.

35:13.197 --> 35:15.666
I lost my lead dog.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.034
We'll be two days behind
if we're lucky.

35:19.036 --> 35:20.671
And we've never been lucky.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.688
You might wanna...

35:38.522 --> 35:40.758
- ...hang on.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:41.358 --> 35:42.693
Okay, Buck.

35:43.861 --> 35:45.362
And, mush!

35:46.164 --> 35:47.395
Whoa!

35:49.633 --> 35:52.435
Hey!

35:53.603 --> 35:56.272
Yeehaw!

35:58.676 --> 36:00.042
Go, Buck!

36:00.044 --> 36:01.045
Go!

36:04.882 --> 36:06.282
Yeah!

36:18.162 --> 36:20.062
Yes, Buck!

36:20.064 --> 36:21.197
Go!

36:21.199 --> 36:22.767
Yeehaw!

36:28.405 --> 36:29.707
Haw!

36:30.308 --> 36:32.710
Buck, haw!

36:36.047 --> 36:37.081
Turn left!

36:37.882 --> 36:39.447
Left!

36:39.449 --> 36:41.349
Turn left!

36:41.351 --> 36:43.654
Go! Turn left!

36:55.398 --> 36:57.400
No! No!

36:58.102 --> 36:59.971
No, no, no!

37:01.205 --> 37:02.673
Are you crazy?

37:19.156 --> 37:22.124
No, no, no! No!

37:34.338 --> 37:36.674
Go, go, go, go!

37:45.182 --> 37:48.185
Faster, Buck! Don't stop!

37:54.659 --> 37:56.292
Perrault?

37:58.296 --> 38:00.131
Yeah!

38:00.965 --> 38:02.563
This is it! This is it!

38:02.565 --> 38:04.465
Don't let up now, Buck!

38:04.467 --> 38:08.172
Yeah, that's it! Yeehaw!

38:12.810 --> 38:14.243
Clear the way!

38:14.245 --> 38:15.344
Move!

38:15.346 --> 38:16.546
Go!

38:22.119 --> 38:23.419
Whoa!

38:23.421 --> 38:24.956
Whoa!

38:30.593 --> 38:31.963
Did you see that?

38:35.498 --> 38:37.034
We made it!

38:38.803 --> 38:39.937
We did it!

38:41.405 --> 38:42.805
Tupper.

38:42.807 --> 38:44.073
Here's one for Kelly.

38:44.075 --> 38:44.940
Yeah.

38:44.942 --> 38:46.008
McCarthy, right here.

38:46.010 --> 38:47.309
Anything for
Elizabeth Snow?

38:47.311 --> 38:48.444
Is there
something for O'Malley?

38:48.446 --> 38:49.610
- Laverne?
- Shaw.

38:49.612 --> 38:50.948
I got three!

38:51.614 --> 38:53.115
Laverne!

38:53.117 --> 38:54.549
Doyle? Kennedy?

38:54.551 --> 38:56.120
I've got
one for Smith. Here.

38:58.422 --> 38:59.622
Lynch.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.161
See, Buck?

39:04.962 --> 39:06.629
We don't carry mail.

39:07.564 --> 39:09.100
We carry lives.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.702
We carry hope.

39:12.203 --> 39:13.771
We carry love.

39:15.106 --> 39:18.809
We leave in the morning.
Let's get some rest.

39:20.478 --> 39:23.147
O'Neil? Walsh?

39:24.849 --> 39:27.118
Gallagher?

39:33.224 --> 39:34.825
Look.

39:46.370 --> 39:48.569
<i>Dearest Sarah.</i>

39:48.571 --> 39:52.575
<i>The soul seems to have
gone out of me now.</i>

39:53.576 --> 39:55.778
<i>Each day</i>

39:55.780 --> 39:58.682
<i>starts with the memory
of our dearest son.</i>

40:00.851 --> 40:02.751
<i>Tim's approaching birthday</i>

40:02.753 --> 40:06.223
<i>reminds me
of all that's been lost.</i>

40:08.826 --> 40:10.861
<i>The warmth of our home...</i>

40:12.897 --> 40:15.632
<i>...the adventures
our son dreamed of.</i>

40:18.235 --> 40:22.773
<i>I wish I'd found the words
to express how I felt</i>

40:23.841 --> 40:26.343
<i>before the silence became</i>

40:27.244 --> 40:28.979
<i>unbearable.</i>

40:30.613 --> 40:32.249
<i>And I left.</i>

40:39.290 --> 40:41.859
<i>I search for a place...</i>

40:43.794 --> 40:46.097
<i>I might feel some</i>

40:46.596 --> 40:47.798
<i>peace.</i>

40:52.870 --> 40:55.873
<i>Though I fear
I will never find it.</i>

41:02.847 --> 41:06.248
<i>Because I know
that as I am,</i>

41:06.250 --> 41:12.089
<i>there may be no home
for me in this world.</i>

41:48.592 --> 41:51.059
- Don't leave. Don't leave!
- Mush!

42:00.437 --> 42:02.037
No, no, no!

42:02.039 --> 42:03.472
Whoa!

42:05.042 --> 42:06.777
Buck! What?

42:08.746 --> 42:10.948
You got time for one
more before you leave?

42:11.382 --> 42:12.781
You're late.

42:12.783 --> 42:15.684
It's just that
it's my son's birthday.

42:15.686 --> 42:17.654
And I need to send
this remembrance to my wife.

42:17.656 --> 42:19.390
You should have come
when we were taking.

42:20.457 --> 42:23.194
Took time
to find the words.

42:32.169 --> 42:33.869
Oh.

42:33.871 --> 42:36.240
You learn to read,
we won't need Perrault anymore.

42:39.109 --> 42:40.642
You are lucky.

42:40.644 --> 42:41.710
Buck is the boss.

42:41.712 --> 42:44.348
Anyone else?

42:45.015 --> 42:48.986
Hey, Buck.
I remember you.

42:51.055 --> 42:52.854
Thank you.

42:52.856 --> 42:54.858
- Thank you for stopping.
- Now we go!

42:55.192 --> 42:56.491
Ready, Buck?

42:56.493 --> 42:59.061
And, mush!

43:04.201 --> 43:05.302
Line up!

43:06.337 --> 43:07.338
Yep!

43:08.305 --> 43:09.773
Nice, Buck!

43:10.808 --> 43:12.409
Yeah, that's it!

43:17.414 --> 43:19.283
Straight ahead!

43:19.984 --> 43:22.253
Yep!

43:35.833 --> 43:38.135
2,400 miles in 80 days?

43:39.903 --> 43:42.139
Buck is gonna
sleep till fall.

43:44.141 --> 43:46.977
Perrault! One for you.
Looks official.

43:52.717 --> 43:54.751
What's the news
from down south?

43:54.753 --> 43:56.053
Good work.

44:01.792 --> 44:03.327
Perrault?

44:21.680 --> 44:23.512
It's okay. It's okay.

44:23.514 --> 44:25.414
It's okay.

44:25.416 --> 44:27.916
You did nothing wrong.

44:27.918 --> 44:30.487
You all done good.

44:31.522 --> 44:32.823
Okay?

44:33.457 --> 44:35.092
I'm sorry, Buck.

44:37.261 --> 44:40.064
They don't need me
and my sled anymore.

44:41.098 --> 44:43.600
By summer,
the telegraph will reach here.

44:44.568 --> 44:47.037
A new way
to send the mail.

44:49.006 --> 44:50.974
It's your team now.

44:52.242 --> 44:55.512
You still have
a mighty journey ahead.

45:34.251 --> 45:38.055
<i>The ground
had shifted under him again.</i>

45:38.956 --> 45:41.525
<i>Buck had lost another master.</i>

45:43.327 --> 45:47.164
<i>Now he would have to be
the leader himself.</i>

45:48.232 --> 45:52.102
<i>Until a new master
came along.</i>

46:19.229 --> 46:22.732
I promised you, didn't I?
And here we are.

46:22.734 --> 46:24.266
You promised me gold.

46:24.268 --> 46:27.235
Where is it?
In the dogs?

46:30.675 --> 46:32.675
Get the sled loaded.

46:32.677 --> 46:35.112
It's time to
stake our claim.

46:36.513 --> 46:37.514
Let's go.

46:38.182 --> 46:39.450
And...

46:40.852 --> 46:42.050
Mush!

46:46.323 --> 46:47.357
Mush!

46:49.993 --> 46:51.126
Are they broken?

46:51.128 --> 46:53.562
No. They're just lazy.

46:53.564 --> 46:54.697
Buck?

46:54.699 --> 46:56.166
Mush!

46:57.100 --> 46:59.634
Charles,
persuade the beast.

46:59.636 --> 47:01.071
Not the club.

47:02.506 --> 47:03.673
Charles!

47:03.675 --> 47:05.040
Put that down or I'll...

47:05.042 --> 47:06.943
I won't go a step!

47:06.945 --> 47:08.645
Charles!

47:12.884 --> 47:14.985
Remember me?

47:18.088 --> 47:20.057
Yeah, I know.

47:25.730 --> 47:27.462
Your runners are frozen.

47:27.464 --> 47:29.264
You'll help your dogs
a mighty lot

47:29.266 --> 47:31.968
if you take the gee pole
and break 'em out.

47:31.970 --> 47:33.570
Gee pole?

47:37.341 --> 47:39.009
What is he doing?

47:42.646 --> 47:44.379
Sir! Watch the Victrola.

47:46.116 --> 47:48.718
Where are you
headed, mister?

47:48.720 --> 47:50.452
It's none of your concern.

47:50.454 --> 47:53.088
You didn't buy that map
in Skagway, did you?

47:53.090 --> 47:55.058
- No.
- That old fairy tale.

47:55.592 --> 47:56.993
Lost cabin.

47:58.395 --> 48:00.128
River of gold?

48:00.130 --> 48:02.030
You're setting off
too far into the spring.

48:02.032 --> 48:03.598
Half that trail
is on the river.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.801
Well, that leaves
half the trail fit for travel.

48:05.803 --> 48:08.004
Oh, it means the ice
is gonna break up

48:08.006 --> 48:10.639
with your companions
and the dogs on it.

48:10.641 --> 48:12.975
Why don't you lay over
till the spring thaw?

48:12.977 --> 48:14.242
Save your dogs

48:14.244 --> 48:15.711
and your companions
the suffering.

48:15.713 --> 48:17.713
And let some old prospector
beat us to the gold?

48:17.715 --> 48:19.080
I'm not a prospector.

48:19.082 --> 48:20.382
No, thank you.

48:20.384 --> 48:22.652
I paid a fortune
for this team.

48:22.654 --> 48:24.252
They'll pull my sled.

48:24.254 --> 48:27.558
They're good dogs, sir.
They'll pull your sled.

48:28.525 --> 48:31.128
They'll pull your sled
till they die.

48:36.034 --> 48:37.234
Thank you.

48:38.602 --> 48:40.070
Let's go.

48:44.207 --> 48:46.374
All right, let's go.

48:46.376 --> 48:47.679
And...

48:48.312 --> 48:49.177
Mush!

49:07.164 --> 49:09.031
You lazy mutts!

49:09.033 --> 49:11.199
I'm not so sure
about those dogs.

49:11.201 --> 49:12.969
Maybe you should've bought
a different team.

49:12.971 --> 49:14.269
Maybe
we should feed them.

49:14.271 --> 49:16.571
We should've stayed
on the trail.

49:16.573 --> 49:17.641
Mush!

49:21.779 --> 49:22.678
Make it stop!

49:33.725 --> 49:36.393
Maybe they need
a little encouragement.

49:39.529 --> 49:41.331
Mush!

49:42.132 --> 49:44.265
Mush!

49:44.267 --> 49:46.002
<i>For the first time,</i>

49:46.004 --> 49:48.570
<i>Buck knew
more than his masters.</i>

49:49.439 --> 49:51.174
Mush!

49:51.843 --> 49:54.043
<i>But the whip</i>

49:54.045 --> 49:56.313
<i>offered him no choice.</i>

50:30.715 --> 50:32.249
Son of a...

50:39.023 --> 50:40.221
Well, now,

50:40.223 --> 50:41.893
we're going across.

50:42.660 --> 50:43.993
Move!

50:47.165 --> 50:50.298
I say you go.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.736
Hal, he can't.

50:52.536 --> 50:53.537
Move.

50:57.709 --> 50:58.710
Don't you dare.

50:59.811 --> 51:00.945
Hey!

51:04.214 --> 51:07.083
That river ice is gonna
break up any minute!

51:07.085 --> 51:08.416
You fool!

51:08.418 --> 51:10.653
That dog is trying
to help you keep your life!

51:10.655 --> 51:11.889
Hal!

51:14.058 --> 51:16.458
Why are you so keen
to stop us?

51:16.460 --> 51:18.863
You know where
the gold is, don't you?

51:24.301 --> 51:27.604
You keep your filthy hands
off of my dogs.

51:27.939 --> 51:29.270
Hal.

51:34.411 --> 51:35.978
Hal, he said
we shouldn't cross.

51:35.980 --> 51:38.848
Hal, are you sure?
Maybe we just leave the dogs?

51:38.850 --> 51:40.883
I know
what I'm doing.

51:40.885 --> 51:42.285
Mush!

51:52.529 --> 51:53.763
Mush!

52:01.304 --> 52:03.205
Don't do this.

52:03.207 --> 52:04.407
Not to them.

52:13.283 --> 52:14.652
Mush!

53:08.505 --> 53:10.875
What am I gonna
do with you?

54:10.868 --> 54:12.569
They're not here.

54:15.273 --> 54:17.440
They're gone.

54:20.811 --> 54:23.513
You've been sleeping
for two days

54:24.015 --> 54:25.548
in my bed.

54:36.426 --> 54:38.129
I'll be back.

54:49.472 --> 54:51.608
Stay. Go.

54:55.313 --> 54:57.081
Do what you want.

55:25.943 --> 55:27.244
Whiskey.

55:54.372 --> 55:56.007
I want the bottle.

56:02.947 --> 56:04.682
They're all gone!

56:05.615 --> 56:07.051
My dogs ran off.

56:07.952 --> 56:09.752
My fortune lost.

56:09.754 --> 56:11.889
You called it a fairy tale.

56:13.824 --> 56:16.158
You didn't want me
finding the gold.

56:27.238 --> 56:28.272
Easy, Buck, easy.

56:29.874 --> 56:31.273
Buck.

56:31.275 --> 56:33.242
- Easy.
- Well, you all saw.

56:33.244 --> 56:35.177
This man and I
had business

56:35.179 --> 56:36.879
and the dog went
for my throat.

56:36.881 --> 56:38.149
Probably rabid.

56:40.885 --> 56:42.550
You leave
that dog alone!

56:42.552 --> 56:44.119
Buck, settle!

56:44.121 --> 56:46.355
You see?

56:46.357 --> 56:48.257
I say it gets put down
here and now.

56:48.259 --> 56:50.392
- No. Come on, mister.
- You don't touch him!

56:50.394 --> 56:52.730
No one puts
any creature down.

56:54.564 --> 56:56.631
Until we hear
all the facts.

56:56.633 --> 56:58.067
The man sucker punched me.

57:01.539 --> 57:03.074
Buck, easy.

57:04.842 --> 57:07.211
What might you have
on that belt, friend?

57:20.891 --> 57:24.159
No guns
on the premises!

57:32.837 --> 57:35.172
You okay,
John Thornton?

57:36.173 --> 57:37.675
Yeah.

57:38.409 --> 57:40.077
I'm fine.

57:58.662 --> 57:59.864
What?

58:00.831 --> 58:03.067
What are you
looking at, huh?

58:17.982 --> 58:19.649
You got something to say?

58:31.328 --> 58:32.329
Buck!

58:34.331 --> 58:36.365
That's not very nice.

58:36.367 --> 58:37.701
What did you do that for?

58:38.068 --> 58:39.601
Hey, Buck!

58:39.603 --> 58:40.971
Buck, what...?

58:41.605 --> 58:42.738
Buck?

58:42.740 --> 58:44.275
Bring that back.

58:46.877 --> 58:49.313
Now what are you
gonna do, huh?

58:58.556 --> 59:00.657
Buck? What are you doing?

59:00.659 --> 59:02.257
Bring that back.

59:02.259 --> 59:04.092
Buck, don't do this.

59:04.094 --> 59:05.396
That's mine.

59:05.796 --> 59:07.696
I need that.

59:07.698 --> 59:09.364
Don't do this to me.

59:09.366 --> 59:11.133
What'd you do?
Where is it?

59:11.135 --> 59:13.235
Just, would you...

59:13.237 --> 59:15.237
Get off.

59:15.239 --> 59:16.840
Get off.

59:19.143 --> 59:20.244
Buck.

59:29.520 --> 59:31.088
Darn, you're big.

59:39.630 --> 59:41.966
This was his birthday.

59:51.242 --> 59:52.743
My son.

59:57.014 --> 59:59.850
After he died,
his mom and I...

1:00:01.552 --> 1:00:04.019
...we just grew apart.

1:00:04.021 --> 1:00:06.790
She didn't wanna
be around me...

1:00:08.693 --> 1:00:11.428
I didn't wanna
be around anybody.

1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:18.869
So, I came up here.

1:00:23.607 --> 1:00:25.574
Then I met you.

1:00:35.386 --> 1:00:36.653
Hell.

1:00:36.655 --> 1:00:38.522
It's around here somewhere.

1:00:40.624 --> 1:00:42.493
Good, you're awake.

1:00:43.762 --> 1:00:45.095
I put it...

1:00:46.897 --> 1:00:48.198
Here it is.

1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:51.268
Something I want
to show ya.

1:00:53.837 --> 1:00:55.039
Come here.

1:00:55.939 --> 1:00:58.206
This is a map
of the Yukon.

1:00:58.208 --> 1:01:03.514
My son was always reading
adventure stories,

1:01:04.581 --> 1:01:06.481
and he was crazy
about the news

1:01:06.483 --> 1:01:07.816
coming out of the Yukon.

1:01:07.818 --> 1:01:09.484
It wasn't the gold.
He didn't care about that.

1:01:09.486 --> 1:01:10.952
It was the mountains.

1:01:10.954 --> 1:01:12.888
He spent all day
looking at maps

1:01:12.890 --> 1:01:14.423
and at pictures
of the mountains.

1:01:14.425 --> 1:01:17.859
Dreaming about
what was on the other side.

1:01:17.861 --> 1:01:19.997
Places no one had been.

1:01:21.332 --> 1:01:22.566
Wild places.

1:01:24.535 --> 1:01:26.669
"Let's go," I said.

1:01:26.671 --> 1:01:28.603
He said, "Yeah, Pop."

1:01:28.605 --> 1:01:30.072
We'd start there,

1:01:30.074 --> 1:01:33.275
but then
he grabbed a pencil

1:01:33.277 --> 1:01:36.912
and he drew a line
off the map

1:01:36.914 --> 1:01:39.782
and he said,
"But let's go there.

1:01:39.784 --> 1:01:43.020
"Off the map.
Where no one's been."

1:01:45.289 --> 1:01:48.890
It's... It's a trip
he would've loved.

1:01:48.892 --> 1:01:50.894
A real adventure.

1:01:55.399 --> 1:01:57.201
We could go.

1:01:59.536 --> 1:02:00.904
You and me.

1:02:02.841 --> 1:02:04.641
See what's out there.

1:02:05.576 --> 1:02:07.042
What do you think?

1:02:07.044 --> 1:02:10.514
It's a canoe, Buck.
We're gonna ride in it.

1:02:15.586 --> 1:02:19.521
Settle. Sit. Sit.
Sit, Buck.

1:02:19.523 --> 1:02:21.992
Good. Good boy.

1:02:46.083 --> 1:02:49.119
Ha. What are you doing?

1:02:50.688 --> 1:02:52.022
Begging?

1:02:57.762 --> 1:02:59.396
You're not my pet.

1:03:10.107 --> 1:03:11.606
Are you comin'?

1:03:12.811 --> 1:03:14.445
Get in here.

1:03:27.191 --> 1:03:28.525
<i>♪ Row your boat ♪</i>

1:03:29.293 --> 1:03:32.461
<i>♪ Gently down the stream ♪</i>

1:03:32.463 --> 1:03:34.897
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
merrily, merrily ♪</i>

1:03:34.899 --> 1:03:36.031
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

1:03:36.033 --> 1:03:39.436
Come on, Buck.
Give us a song.

1:03:42.005 --> 1:03:43.605
Maybe not.

1:04:16.073 --> 1:04:17.606
Whoa!

1:04:25.783 --> 1:04:27.850
Whoa!

1:04:31.088 --> 1:04:33.388
I'm glad you're enjoying this.

1:04:49.039 --> 1:04:50.742
Oh, you like that, huh?

1:05:03.688 --> 1:05:05.690
I guess
we walk from here.

1:06:00.044 --> 1:06:02.579
Your ancestors
used to roam here.

1:06:03.081 --> 1:06:04.514
And mine.

1:06:05.215 --> 1:06:07.382
Back when we were wild.

1:06:15.392 --> 1:06:17.662
We come and go,
don't we?

1:06:20.031 --> 1:06:21.866
This is always here.

1:06:34.779 --> 1:06:35.878
What?

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:37.947
I don't know. Which way?
You tell me.

1:06:37.949 --> 1:06:39.851
Go on. You lead.

1:06:51.996 --> 1:06:53.530
Buck?

1:07:06.911 --> 1:07:10.380
Ah. Look what you found.

1:07:24.162 --> 1:07:25.529
Boy...

1:07:28.265 --> 1:07:30.966
Look at this, Buck.

1:07:30.968 --> 1:07:33.971
I don't think
we're off all maps.

1:07:43.881 --> 1:07:45.917
A prospector, I guess.

1:07:46.684 --> 1:07:47.919
Trash.

1:07:48.452 --> 1:07:50.786
Trash.

1:07:50.788 --> 1:07:52.222
Trash.

1:08:00.998 --> 1:08:02.834
Treasure.

1:08:11.008 --> 1:08:14.409
This is mine. All right?

1:08:14.411 --> 1:08:16.013
Just leave it alone.
It's mine.

1:08:39.269 --> 1:08:40.738
Good day.

1:09:00.825 --> 1:09:02.693
It's your ancestors.

1:09:04.695 --> 1:09:06.030
Wolves.

1:10:07.658 --> 1:10:10.460
That's good, Buck,

1:10:11.195 --> 1:10:13.630
but more like this, huh?

1:10:22.006 --> 1:10:23.975
Damn fairy tale's true.

1:10:31.983 --> 1:10:33.885
That's more like it, Buck.

1:10:35.286 --> 1:10:36.854
Attaboy!

1:10:48.632 --> 1:10:51.501
What?
What you looking at?

1:10:56.374 --> 1:10:57.742
Go take a look.

1:10:58.976 --> 1:11:00.044
Go on.

1:11:00.543 --> 1:11:01.946
Go on.

1:11:03.714 --> 1:11:06.583
Just be back before dark!

1:13:19.917 --> 1:13:20.918
Buck!

1:15:15.900 --> 1:15:18.335
<i>Here,
so far from home...</i>

1:15:19.703 --> 1:15:22.273
<i>I can see a change
in Buck.</i>

1:15:26.310 --> 1:15:29.046
<i>Something's pulling him
into the forest.</i>

1:15:31.482 --> 1:15:33.184
<i>Into the hunt.</i>

1:15:44.495 --> 1:15:46.363
That's beautiful, Buck.

1:15:47.164 --> 1:15:48.732
Beautiful.

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:53.569
<i>He's still the same dog
with me,</i>

1:15:53.571 --> 1:15:55.940
<i>but I find it hard
to imagine him</i>

1:15:56.840 --> 1:15:59.443
<i>back in civilization.</i>

1:16:01.912 --> 1:16:04.513
<i>Is there any house
big enough to hold him?</i>

1:16:19.997 --> 1:16:24.101
<i>This journey seems to be
leading Buck to his destiny.</i>

1:16:33.611 --> 1:16:35.946
<i>Where is it leading me?</i>

1:17:39.443 --> 1:17:40.844
Not this time.

1:17:43.213 --> 1:17:44.982
Long after dark.

1:17:46.850 --> 1:17:51.055
You've been staying out
later and later every day.

1:17:52.691 --> 1:17:56.091
Yeah, I know,
there's a lot to explore

1:17:56.093 --> 1:17:58.562
but world's
a dangerous place.

1:17:59.496 --> 1:18:01.432
You never know
what's coming.

1:18:03.567 --> 1:18:06.303
You never know.

1:18:11.842 --> 1:18:15.946
Fever took Timmy
in two days.

1:18:25.622 --> 1:18:26.990
Hell.

1:18:29.761 --> 1:18:31.628
Okay, Buck.

1:18:48.912 --> 1:18:51.382
It's been
a beautiful summer.

1:18:58.989 --> 1:19:00.457
You know what, Buck?

1:19:01.959 --> 1:19:03.560
I've been thinking.

1:19:04.995 --> 1:19:07.830
I might buy myself
a railroad.

1:19:07.832 --> 1:19:08.997
Is that my hat?

1:19:08.999 --> 1:19:10.632
That's my hat.
Come on.

1:19:10.634 --> 1:19:12.033
Give me my hat.

1:19:12.035 --> 1:19:13.803
Give me my hat.

1:19:13.805 --> 1:19:16.273
Give me my hat.
Give me my hat.

1:19:17.441 --> 1:19:18.442
Buck!

1:19:18.710 --> 1:19:19.878
Buck!

1:19:20.177 --> 1:19:21.109
Come on.

1:19:21.111 --> 1:19:23.547
There you go.

1:19:28.452 --> 1:19:29.486
Ooh.

1:19:30.954 --> 1:19:32.523
Timber wolf.

1:19:33.691 --> 1:19:35.259
Beautiful.

1:19:36.694 --> 1:19:38.696
This is their domain.

1:19:39.430 --> 1:19:41.298
They own these hills.

1:19:48.673 --> 1:19:49.674
You wanna go?

1:19:50.708 --> 1:19:51.808
Go.

1:19:51.810 --> 1:19:53.177
Just...

1:19:55.446 --> 1:19:57.147
...be careful.

1:20:48.700 --> 1:20:51.168
<i>He had been
both spoiled</i>

1:20:52.236 --> 1:20:54.202
<i>and he'd suffered</i>

1:20:54.204 --> 1:20:56.206
<i>at the hand of man.</i>

1:20:57.876 --> 1:21:00.377
<i>Now, Buck found himself</i>

1:21:01.478 --> 1:21:03.547
<i>with his own kind.</i>

1:21:04.983 --> 1:21:09.086
<i>How far he has traveled
to find his home.</i>

1:21:11.555 --> 1:21:15.192
<i>How far I have traveled
from mine.</i>

1:21:34.712 --> 1:21:36.113
Here, look, Buck.

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:37.682
Groceries.

1:21:39.651 --> 1:21:41.184
For life.

1:21:42.085 --> 1:21:44.354
No man needs
more than that.

1:21:47.190 --> 1:21:49.493
It's time for me
to go, Buck.

1:21:50.728 --> 1:21:52.195
Go home.

1:21:52.730 --> 1:21:55.096
Whatever's left of it.

1:21:55.098 --> 1:21:56.366
Pick up the pieces,

1:21:58.068 --> 1:21:59.369
or at least try.

1:22:05.810 --> 1:22:06.811
No.

1:22:08.545 --> 1:22:11.281
I'm not asking you
to come with me, Buck.

1:22:15.019 --> 1:22:17.354
You got something here.

1:22:18.188 --> 1:22:20.290
Something important.

1:22:21.091 --> 1:22:23.427
Hang onto it.

1:22:26.998 --> 1:22:28.666
I'm leaving
in the morning.

1:22:29.867 --> 1:22:31.803
Come say bye.

1:22:38.241 --> 1:22:40.678
You're a good dog, Buck.

1:22:52.056 --> 1:22:54.524
You're a good dog.

1:24:53.678 --> 1:24:55.543
You came
all the way out here.

1:24:55.545 --> 1:24:57.579
You knew something,
didn't you?

1:24:57.581 --> 1:24:58.446
Easy.

1:24:58.448 --> 1:25:00.450
You wanted it
all for yourself.

1:25:01.251 --> 1:25:03.251
Where is it?

1:25:03.253 --> 1:25:04.989
Where's the gold?

1:25:14.899 --> 1:25:16.333
It's everywhere.

1:25:20.537 --> 1:25:22.238
Take it.

1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:24.039
Take it all.

1:25:24.041 --> 1:25:25.877
It won't change anything.

1:25:27.044 --> 1:25:29.412
It won't
bring back the dead.

1:25:48.266 --> 1:25:49.499
Ah.

1:25:50.168 --> 1:25:51.599
You know this, do you?

1:25:51.601 --> 1:25:53.202
Good.

1:25:53.204 --> 1:25:54.437
You see it, boy?

1:25:55.106 --> 1:25:56.839
You see it?

1:25:56.841 --> 1:25:58.441
Good.

1:26:33.878 --> 1:26:34.946
Buck.

1:26:36.180 --> 1:26:37.380
Yeah.

1:26:40.051 --> 1:26:41.585
You came back.

1:28:00.164 --> 1:28:01.732
Wow, Buck.

1:28:06.436 --> 1:28:08.739
What an adventure, huh?

1:28:22.485 --> 1:28:24.655
It's okay, boy.

1:28:43.174 --> 1:28:44.942
You're home.

1:30:25.776 --> 1:30:29.146
<i>There is a place
in these mountains</i>

1:30:31.182 --> 1:30:35.286
<i>where a new breed
of timber wolf roams...</i>

1:30:36.420 --> 1:30:40.222
<i>wiser than man or wolf...</i>

1:30:41.692 --> 1:30:44.359
<i>...because of the dog</i>

1:30:44.361 --> 1:30:46.330
<i>that runs at the head
of the pack.</i>

1:30:48.365 --> 1:30:51.967
<i>Now they live
without fear,</i>

1:30:51.969 --> 1:30:55.906
<i>raise their young,
and flourish.</i>

1:31:23.134 --> 1:31:27.171
<i>Some say
it's just a legend.</i>

1:31:28.305 --> 1:31:29.905
<i>Not so.</i>

1:31:29.907 --> 1:31:33.744
<i>You see,
I knew him once</i>

1:31:34.912 --> 1:31:38.816
<i>when he was just a dog
at a man's side.</i>

1:31:42.786 --> 1:31:45.789
<i>And even though
this land is his,</i>

1:31:46.323 --> 1:31:48.090
<i>every summer</i>

1:31:48.092 --> 1:31:51.393
<i>when he comes down
to the valley,</i>

1:31:51.395 --> 1:31:54.763
<i>he remembers kind hands</i>

1:31:54.765 --> 1:31:56.734
<i>and old masters.</i>

1:32:00.604 --> 1:32:03.340
<i>Before he went
to his own,</i>

1:32:04.575 --> 1:32:07.344
<i>became his own master.</i>

1:32:09.813 --> 1:32:11.715
<i>Before he heard</i>

1:32:12.449 --> 1:32:14.318
<i>the call.</i>
