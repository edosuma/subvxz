00:12.304 --> 00:14.164
How many knocks
do you normally go with?

00:14.224 --> 00:16.084
Two?
Two's not enough.

00:16.144 --> 00:17.604
What do you do?
Three.

00:17.664 --> 00:19.604
If I hear two knocks, I just think
it's a random house noise,

00:19.664 --> 00:22.644
but three evenly spaced knocks,
someone's at the door.

00:22.704 --> 00:24.844
Dumb. You're gonna wear your hand
down faster than me.

00:24.904 --> 00:27.084
Three's the standard.
Knock-knock jokes.

00:27.144 --> 00:29.244
Two knocks. Case closed.
Yeah, but...

00:29.304 --> 00:31.564
It's not, "Knock-knock-knock.
Who's there?"

00:31.624 --> 00:33.084
Well, it should be.
It's much funnier.

00:33.144 --> 00:36.724
Let me knock. If they come to
the door after two, you have to...

00:36.784 --> 00:38.964
..randomly hug your mum
when we get back to the office.

00:39.024 --> 00:40.564
Well, I'm not saying
they won't come to the door,

00:40.624 --> 00:42.884
I'm just saying they'll be unsure
whether or not someone's AT the door

00:42.944 --> 00:44.164
because you only knocked twice.

00:44.224 --> 00:46.684
(KNOCKS TWICE) I can hear footsteps.

00:46.744 --> 00:48.244
Well, they're probably
right next to the door.

00:48.304 --> 00:50.684
You have to hug your mum
and you can't tell her why!

00:50.744 --> 00:52.884
This doesn't prove anything. Hi, Kit.

00:52.944 --> 00:54.684
Hi.
Hey. Um, come in.

00:54.744 --> 00:57.564
Kit, um, just quickly,
this is a weird question,

00:57.624 --> 01:01.044
but did you hear the two knocks
and think someone was at the door

01:01.104 --> 01:03.164
or that it was just
a random house noise at first?

01:03.224 --> 01:04.524
Someone at the door.

01:04.584 --> 01:07.004
Of course you did.
Like everyone would.

01:08.264 --> 01:10.124
Do you want to come in now?
Yes, please.

01:10.184 --> 01:11.364
Uh!

01:13.104 --> 01:15.084
So, we were a bit confused
by your message.

01:15.144 --> 01:17.404
Did you say random people
keep popping around?

01:17.464 --> 01:19.164
Yes.
OK.

01:19.224 --> 01:21.084
Did somebody die in this house?

01:22.584 --> 01:26.284
Did the last tenant before me die?
Recently?

01:26.344 --> 01:27.364
Uh...

01:27.424 --> 01:28.644
Because that seems like something

01:28.704 --> 01:30.244
you'd tell me
before I moved in, right?

01:30.304 --> 01:33.564
Why would you think someone died?

01:43.584 --> 01:46.644
Because people keep on leaving
flowers outside my front door.

01:46.704 --> 01:49.124
Maybe you've got a secret admirer.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.524
No, someone did die in here.
I'm sorry.

01:53.544 --> 01:55.724
# Yeah, we know

01:55.784 --> 01:59.444
# Even if we had so far to go

01:59.504 --> 02:02.604
# Even if the pace is slow

02:02.664 --> 02:06.044
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again

02:07.944 --> 02:10.524
# If we find

02:10.584 --> 02:14.524
# Something to feel that we belong

02:14.584 --> 02:17.644
# If we could right all the wrongs

02:17.704 --> 02:20.884
# Well, I'll be coming home
to you again. #

02:26.024 --> 02:29.124
You didn't think that somebody
dying in here before I moved in

02:29.184 --> 02:30.564
was important information?

02:30.624 --> 02:34.044
Well, I mean, everyone dies
somewhere, right?

02:34.104 --> 02:35.404
You might die here.

02:35.464 --> 02:37.404
Oh, is that why the place
came fully furnished?

02:37.464 --> 02:39.084
The family didn't know what to do
with everything

02:39.144 --> 02:40.524
after Janine passed away,

02:40.584 --> 02:43.164
so the landlord offered
to rent the place fully furnished.

02:43.224 --> 02:44.444
Lucky you!

02:44.504 --> 02:46.164
Was she murdered?

02:46.224 --> 02:49.044
Oh, no, no. She was
a little old lady in her 90s.

02:49.104 --> 02:50.364
Where?

02:50.424 --> 02:52.364
Where?
Yeah, where did she die?

02:55.424 --> 02:57.764
What, right there?
Very peacefully.

02:57.824 --> 02:59.444
You don't peacefully die
on the floor.

02:59.504 --> 03:01.444
Well, there was a chair there.

03:01.504 --> 03:03.844
Right. Well, at least that's gone.

03:03.904 --> 03:05.284
Moved.
What?

03:06.664 --> 03:08.364
What, it's still here?!

03:08.424 --> 03:10.964
Well, it's a...
it's a very nice chair.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.764
Yeah. Except somebody died in it.

03:12.824 --> 03:15.164
Yes, but not because of the chair.

03:15.224 --> 03:16.924
You should have told me.

03:16.984 --> 03:18.684
And I don't want to be
dealing with any more flowers.

03:18.744 --> 03:21.084
I did not sign up to rent a shrine.

03:21.144 --> 03:23.844
Kit, I am so sorry.
If there's anything we can do...

03:23.904 --> 03:25.244
We can take the flowers if you like.

03:25.304 --> 03:27.604
Or just some of them, if you want
to keep some as decoration, or...

03:27.664 --> 03:28.724
You can leave.

03:28.784 --> 03:29.764
Yep.
Yeah.

03:29.824 --> 03:31.324
Wait.

03:32.904 --> 03:34.284
Did you know her?

03:34.344 --> 03:36.244
Janine? No, it was a proper rental.

03:36.304 --> 03:38.644
The landlord contacted us
after she passed away.

03:38.704 --> 03:40.844
I wonder if she WAS little.
What?

03:40.904 --> 03:43.364
You said "little old lady".
People always say that.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.844
Maybe she was massive.
A massive old lady?

03:45.904 --> 03:47.844
Yeah, why not? This is a big chair.

03:47.904 --> 03:50.004
Yeah, but she's not carrying it
around. She's sitting in it.

03:51.024 --> 03:52.644
Op shop?
We can't.

03:52.704 --> 03:55.404
The family might want it back.
Yeah, don't want to mess with them.

03:55.464 --> 03:57.124
Because they might be massive?

03:57.184 --> 03:58.404
Yeah.

04:02.904 --> 04:05.444
(KNOCKS THREE TIMES)
Too many.

04:05.504 --> 04:06.964
Mum, could we please borrow you
for a second?

04:07.024 --> 04:08.044
Sure.

04:08.104 --> 04:10.044
I don't suppose
this is about a tenant

04:10.104 --> 04:12.204
you forgot to inform
had someone die in their rental

04:12.264 --> 04:14.484
and is now surrounded by
a dead person's furniture?

04:14.544 --> 04:18.404
No. We...just wanted to see
how you were. Good?

04:18.464 --> 04:19.764
He called to complain.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.444
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

04:21.504 --> 04:23.804
He loved the place
and I didn't want to ruin it for him.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.244
I mean, the fact
that someone died in there

04:25.304 --> 04:27.044
doesn't change anything
about the property.

04:27.104 --> 04:29.564
Eh...
Well, I mean, there was no damage.

04:29.624 --> 04:30.844
What are the rules?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.004
There aren't any.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.284
Life is chaos. I knew it.
There's common sense.

04:35.344 --> 04:37.244
He never asked if anyone died.

04:37.304 --> 04:38.684
Daniel, people aren't gonna ask

04:38.744 --> 04:40.564
if someone died recently
in the living room,

04:40.624 --> 04:42.524
because they trust
the agent will tell them.

04:42.584 --> 04:44.884
Ah! Died in the living...
Never mind.

04:44.944 --> 04:46.604
If he wants to break his lease,

04:46.664 --> 04:49.004
we won't charge him anything
for the advertising.

04:49.064 --> 04:52.444
And if he asks for his first month's
rent back, YOU can cover the cost.

04:52.504 --> 04:54.404
(GROANS)
AND you, Emma.

04:54.464 --> 04:56.044
You could have told him too.
What?

04:56.104 --> 04:58.724
But Daniel's the one who said we
shouldn't mention the, you know...

04:59.864 --> 05:02.804
I don't care.
You can both pay if he moves out.

05:02.864 --> 05:05.204
It isn't fair on the landlord
and you should have known better.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.364
Anything else?
No.

05:11.264 --> 05:13.964
Hey, Barbara, knock-knock-knock.

05:14.024 --> 05:15.164
What?

05:15.224 --> 05:16.644
It's weird, right?

05:21.504 --> 05:24.004
Would you want to be told
if someone died in your house?

05:24.064 --> 05:25.404
No, I don't want to think about it.

05:25.464 --> 05:27.684
It's like when you stay in a hotel,
you don't want to think about

05:27.744 --> 05:30.244
all the people that have had sex
in the bed you're sleeping in.

05:30.304 --> 05:32.964
I mean, they change the sheets,
but is that enough?

05:33.024 --> 05:34.724
Now I've ruined hotels for myself.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.684
Here's my impression
of a hotel room bed -

05:36.744 --> 05:40.364
"No more! I'll never be clean!
Bleagh, get off!

05:40.424 --> 05:42.404
"If you wouldn't do it at home,
don't do it on me!"

05:42.464 --> 05:44.004
That's really good.
Ooh, let me knock again.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.924
(KNOCKS TWICE)

05:48.024 --> 05:51.524
I can't hear any footsteps. Maybe
you should have knocked three times.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.804
Or they're not home.

05:54.344 --> 05:56.764
(KNOCKS THREE TIMES)
Well, that's five times now.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.324
They're not gonna answer
to a psychopath.

05:58.384 --> 05:59.444
Or they're not home.

06:00.904 --> 06:03.884
What if they're dead?
No, they...

06:03.944 --> 06:05.324
They wouldn't be.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.004
Oh, thank God!
Oh, you're OK!

06:10.064 --> 06:12.164
What?
Oh, sorry, we thought you were, um...

06:12.224 --> 06:13.844
..not home.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.484
I wasn't sure if someone was
at the door at first.

06:15.544 --> 06:16.724
Ha!

06:16.784 --> 06:18.844
Oh, sorry, that was
referring to a, uh...

06:18.904 --> 06:20.724
Do you mind if we do
the inspection now?

06:20.784 --> 06:22.284
Three knocks.

06:22.344 --> 06:24.444
Stop celebrating.
We're just even now.

06:24.504 --> 06:26.684
And only because you didn't uphold
your end of the deal

06:26.744 --> 06:28.084
when you lost the first time.

06:28.144 --> 06:30.724
OK, next loser hugs Barbara.
I mean Mum.

06:30.784 --> 06:34.284
Deal. I love this.
It never gets old, the snooping.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.244
Well, it's not snooping,
it's inspecting.

06:36.304 --> 06:38.084
Don't look in the fridge.
We've discussed this.

06:38.144 --> 06:39.604
I'm looking for
novelty fridge magnets.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.124
Nothing. Boring.

06:41.184 --> 06:42.404
Is that Grace?

06:42.464 --> 06:43.804
Hmm?
Look at this.

06:46.024 --> 06:47.884
It's Grace!
It is, right?

06:47.944 --> 06:49.324
Who's that guy?

06:49.384 --> 06:53.284
Wowsers! Well, he's not my type, but
conventionally speaking, va-va-voom!

06:53.344 --> 06:54.764
I get it.
Who is he?

06:54.824 --> 06:57.644
I don't know.
You don't suppose he's an ex?

06:57.704 --> 06:59.404
God, I hope not. Look at him.

06:59.464 --> 07:01.444
He might just be
a really, really hot friend.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.364
I mean, some people just have
really hot friends.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.084
Like, you have
a really hot friend - me.

07:05.144 --> 07:07.284
I'm just going to hang
some washing out.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.684
I spilt sauce on my good shawl
at bridge.

07:09.744 --> 07:11.204
Let me know if you need me.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.724
Uh, Karina, I was just...inspecting

07:14.784 --> 07:18.284
and I noticed you have a photo
of my partner on your fridge.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.124
Really?

07:21.624 --> 07:24.964
Well, how about that?
Do you know my godson John?

07:25.024 --> 07:27.204
Uh, no, just my partner Grace.

07:27.264 --> 07:29.404
Grace, is it?
I honestly can't remember.

07:29.464 --> 07:30.524
He sent me that years ago,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.924
and, well, you know,
there's...there's been a few.

07:32.984 --> 07:34.844
What?
Ladies.

07:34.904 --> 07:37.204
John's always been quite popular
with the ladies.

07:37.264 --> 07:39.204
Right.

07:39.264 --> 07:40.884
So are you. With A lady.

07:40.944 --> 07:42.604
And I like you.

07:42.664 --> 07:44.644
So, they were dating?

07:45.704 --> 07:48.284
I can't remember.
Anyway, small world.

07:48.344 --> 07:50.764
I'll have to tell John.
Or never tell him.

07:50.824 --> 07:52.044
Hmm?
Doesn't matter.

07:57.024 --> 07:59.484
Are you thinking about John?
No.

08:00.864 --> 08:04.804
What are you thinking about?
How to make...gravy?

08:04.864 --> 08:06.084
Yes, John.

08:06.144 --> 08:07.724
I just don't see why
Grace would be dating me

08:07.784 --> 08:09.404
after dating someone like him.

08:09.464 --> 08:10.964
He looks like he's secretly Batman.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.644
First of all, we don't know
they were dating.

08:12.704 --> 08:14.244
They could have been friends.

08:14.304 --> 08:16.004
Second, he might have been a jerk -

08:16.064 --> 08:17.724
that's why they're not
together anymore.

08:17.784 --> 08:19.724
And third, Grace is with you now.

08:19.784 --> 08:21.364
I know.

08:21.424 --> 08:23.484
Then stop worrying.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.164
What would make you feel better?

08:26.224 --> 08:29.324
If he was happily married
or... (COUGHS) ..dead.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.164
Dead? Harsh.

08:31.224 --> 08:34.644
I'm not wishing death upon him,
I'm just saying if he WAS dead...

08:34.704 --> 08:36.684
Fine, if it makes you feel better,

08:36.744 --> 08:38.684
I'll assassinate him
for your birthday.

08:38.744 --> 08:40.244
Thanks, mate.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.684
Although, good luck
pulling the trigger

08:41.744 --> 08:43.284
when you look at his perfect face.
Oh!

08:48.184 --> 08:49.604
(SIGHS)

08:49.664 --> 08:51.084
(DOOR OPENS)

08:53.024 --> 08:54.564
Hey.
Hey.

08:54.624 --> 08:56.084
How was your day?
Good.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.644
How was yours?
Yeah, great.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.724
I read this amazing article
on information retention

09:00.784 --> 09:02.884
and it had so many
fascinating insights,

09:02.944 --> 09:05.764
it was easier to highlight the bits
that I DIDN'T want to remember.

09:05.824 --> 09:07.884
Although, highlighting things
you don't want to remember

09:07.944 --> 09:09.284
wasn't one of the tips.

09:09.344 --> 09:10.404
That is cool.

09:10.464 --> 09:14.724
Um, hey, I had an inspection today
with a lady called Karina.

09:14.784 --> 09:15.844
Yeah?

09:15.904 --> 09:18.884
And she had a photo on her fridge
that had you in it.

09:18.944 --> 09:21.564
Me? I don't think I know a Karina.

09:21.624 --> 09:24.524
Um, no, but you might know
her godson John?

09:24.584 --> 09:25.644
John?

09:26.624 --> 09:29.204
Do you know his last name?
No, but you were on a beach.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.244
He had brown hair, a tank top.

09:33.184 --> 09:35.324
Very buff and handsome.
Oh, THAT John.

09:35.384 --> 09:36.524
That John?

09:36.584 --> 09:37.964
Yeah, I haven't thought about him
in years.

09:38.024 --> 09:40.044
We studied medicine together.
He studied medicine?

09:40.104 --> 09:42.404
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon now.
He's a heart surgeon?

09:42.464 --> 09:46.084
Heart, lungs, oesophagus
and other areas in the chest, yeah.

09:46.144 --> 09:47.724
So, if you hurt your foot,
he's useless?

09:47.784 --> 09:49.604
Well, no, he's still a doctor, so...
It's OK.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.324
He's in the US now.
Oh.

09:51.384 --> 09:53.404
Well, he was last time we spoke.

09:53.464 --> 09:56.364
Um...did you date?

09:56.424 --> 09:59.884
For a few months, but then
we broke up and he moved away

09:59.944 --> 10:01.764
and we didn't stay in touch.

10:01.824 --> 10:05.524
So, you broke up because he wanted
to move to the US and you didn't?

10:05.584 --> 10:07.844
No, we just weren't right
for each other.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.404
I'm sorry I haven't told you
about him.

10:11.464 --> 10:13.764
There was just nothing
very interesting to report.

10:13.824 --> 10:17.244
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.
I was...I was just curious.

10:17.304 --> 10:20.124
He um, used to steal toys
from children.

10:20.184 --> 10:21.444
Really?

10:21.504 --> 10:25.804
No. But he might have developed
that habit since I last saw him.

10:31.944 --> 10:33.484
(DOOR OPENS)

10:34.464 --> 10:36.884
EMMA: Morning.
MRS MARSH: Morning.

10:36.944 --> 10:39.484
Morning!
Hmm? Morning.

10:40.624 --> 10:42.204
What are you up to?

10:42.264 --> 10:43.644
Just work.

10:45.024 --> 10:46.724
Oh, yeah?

10:46.784 --> 10:48.444
Just gonna get a file.

10:49.824 --> 10:52.564
Busted! You're stalking
the fridge man.

10:52.624 --> 10:55.684
That's work, is it?
Maybe he needs a rental?

10:56.624 --> 10:58.964
They dated, and I can't tell
if he's dating someone new now

10:59.024 --> 11:00.844
because I can't access
his full profile.

11:00.904 --> 11:04.724
His security settings are too high.
Oh. What a paranoid weirdo.

11:04.784 --> 11:06.844
What did Grace say?

11:06.904 --> 11:09.084
She said they dated for a few months,

11:09.144 --> 11:11.084
he moved to the US,
they weren't right for each other.

11:11.144 --> 11:14.164
Great. He's gone.
What are you worried about?

11:14.224 --> 11:16.004
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon.

11:16.064 --> 11:20.004
OK. And you are a moderately
successful salesperson.

11:20.064 --> 11:23.564
I looked up how much they earn.
500 grand a year on average.

11:23.624 --> 11:25.044
Maybe he has a website.

11:25.104 --> 11:26.244
Stop typing.

11:27.464 --> 11:29.124
And moving the mouse.
One more click.

11:29.184 --> 11:30.804
Daniel!
He does have a website.

11:30.864 --> 11:33.084
Look at how much charity work
he's done.

11:33.144 --> 11:35.604
That's more than a token amount.
He genuinely cares.

11:35.664 --> 11:37.764
Hey!
I'm cutting you off.

11:37.824 --> 11:40.684
What if Grace doesn't really
want to be with me?

11:40.744 --> 11:42.084
What if she's just settling?

11:42.144 --> 11:45.444
I mean, I can't follow that guy.
Look at me.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.764
I'm not just a step down,
I'm a whole staircase.

11:47.824 --> 11:50.364
Hey! That is my friend
you're talking about.

11:50.424 --> 11:52.404
You're not a staircase.
Hello?

11:52.464 --> 11:55.004
I'm telling you,
this is not a big deal.

11:55.064 --> 11:56.404
Daniel?

11:56.464 --> 11:59.284
Probably John wanting to tell me he's
solved world hunger. Yes, Mrs Marsh?

11:59.344 --> 12:02.124
There's a Kit on the phone for you.

12:02.184 --> 12:03.564
Oh, Kit. Um...

12:04.744 --> 12:07.484
Hi, Kit. Daniel here. Everything OK?

12:07.544 --> 12:10.604
(SOBS)

12:10.664 --> 12:13.924
Hi...everyone.
Hi.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.404
Can I speak to you
in the hallway, please?

12:16.464 --> 12:18.404
Yep.
Sure.

12:18.464 --> 12:20.404
(CONTINUES SOBBING)
WOMAN: Oh, darling.

12:21.344 --> 12:23.244
Why did you let them in?

12:23.304 --> 12:26.604
Because they were just standing on
the lawn, looking in. Looking sad.

12:26.664 --> 12:29.404
I had another guy this morning just
holding his hand at my letterbox

12:29.464 --> 12:31.324
with his eyes closed
for a minute and a half.

12:31.384 --> 12:34.244
We'll ask them to leave.
But they're so sad.

12:34.304 --> 12:36.444
They keep talking about her
like she's still here.

12:36.504 --> 12:38.644
It's like I've got a dead flatmate
who doesn't pay rent

12:38.704 --> 12:40.684
and has her miserable friends over
all the time.

12:40.744 --> 12:42.364
I came here for some privacy.

12:43.624 --> 12:44.964
Oh, and I'm late for work.

12:45.024 --> 12:46.964
This is too much. I want out.

12:47.024 --> 12:50.204
Oh, Kit, first of all,
the rent here is incredibly cheap...

12:50.264 --> 12:52.444
Yeah, because somebody died here.

12:52.504 --> 12:53.844
Well...

12:53.904 --> 12:55.604
And second of all?
Sorry?

12:55.664 --> 12:58.644
Well, you said "first of all".
What else is good about living here?

12:58.704 --> 13:00.564
(WOMAN SOBS)
Em?

13:00.624 --> 13:03.924
Uh, this door...slides...

13:03.984 --> 13:05.324
And back.

13:05.384 --> 13:07.324
What time do you finish work?
6:30.

13:07.384 --> 13:10.284
OK, we'll make sure this is
all sorted by the time you get home.

13:10.344 --> 13:13.324
No more mourners, no need
to move out. Just trust us.

13:24.624 --> 13:26.324
Hi.

13:26.384 --> 13:30.724
Um, I'm Daniel and this is Emma
from McCallum Real Estate,

13:30.784 --> 13:36.764
and we'd...really appreciate it
if you could...please leave.

13:36.824 --> 13:38.244
Oh, God! (SOBS)

13:38.304 --> 13:39.764
No rush.

13:39.824 --> 13:42.164
We should have made
more of an effort.

13:42.224 --> 13:44.004
We're a very tight-knit
neighbourhood.

13:44.064 --> 13:47.484
Most of us have lived
our whole lives here.

13:47.544 --> 13:50.124
But Janine, well,
she'd only been here five years.

13:50.184 --> 13:52.924
Well, that's no excuse!
Yeah, I know, I know.

13:52.984 --> 13:55.604
She never got a visit
from her family.

13:55.664 --> 13:58.284
We didn't do enough
to reach out to her.

13:58.344 --> 14:00.004
Was there a funeral?

14:00.064 --> 14:04.524
Yes, but no-one outside
the family knew when or where.

14:04.584 --> 14:08.284
And a lot of us feel guilty
she was alone at the end.

14:08.344 --> 14:11.084
We just wanted to say goodbye.

14:11.144 --> 14:13.044
Sure.

14:13.104 --> 14:15.084
Do you think it'll take
longer than an hour, or...

14:15.144 --> 14:16.604
Oh, God!

14:19.104 --> 14:20.604
I can't believe she's gone.

14:22.024 --> 14:23.644
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

14:23.704 --> 14:25.804
That sucked.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.724
Yes, it did.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.404
I don't want to ask them
to stop coming around,

14:29.464 --> 14:30.804
but what else can we do?

14:30.864 --> 14:32.084
Hire a bouncer?

14:32.144 --> 14:34.524
Maybe we should ask
all of them around.

14:34.584 --> 14:37.084
Do the opposite of what
we're trying to achieve?

14:37.144 --> 14:39.724
Give them an opportunity
to say goodbye properly.

14:39.784 --> 14:41.604
You mean like have another funeral?

14:41.664 --> 14:42.964
No, of course not.
Good.

14:43.024 --> 14:44.244
We'll have a wake.
What?

14:44.304 --> 14:47.564
We have a small service before
Kit gets back, in the front yard.

14:47.624 --> 14:49.044
Seems like they all live
in the street.

14:49.104 --> 14:50.604
Ohh...
I'll see if I can catch them.

14:50.664 --> 14:52.444
Hang on. Em, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:52.504 --> 14:55.124
Are you sure about this?
I've never put on a wake before.

14:55.184 --> 14:58.324
It'll just be like
a birthday party, but sadder.

15:07.624 --> 15:09.484
Do you think people will care
we don't have a photo?

15:09.544 --> 15:11.364
No, I think her favourite chair
will be enough.

15:11.424 --> 15:13.004
Well, we don't know if
it's her favourite chair.

15:13.064 --> 15:15.644
It's just the last one she sat in.
Yeah, she chose that chair.

15:15.704 --> 15:18.484
I don't think she was like,
"I'm about to die. Where do I sit?"

15:18.544 --> 15:20.884
When I die, I want
my last words to be,

15:20.944 --> 15:23.964
"No, David Tennant, YOU'RE the
greatest lover that I'VE ever had."

15:24.984 --> 15:27.444
Hey, uh, Grace is coming to help
in a sec.

15:27.504 --> 15:28.804
Is she? Why?

15:28.864 --> 15:32.124
I told her that how much the
neighbourhood cared really hit me

15:32.184 --> 15:35.804
and that I wanted to do all I could
to give them closure.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.204
Please stop competing with a man
who isn't even here.

15:38.264 --> 15:41.564
Maybe he hates being a heart surgeon
and he's only doing it to look good.

15:41.624 --> 15:43.364
He already looks good.
Oh, hi, Grace!

15:43.424 --> 15:45.164
Hey.
Hi.

15:45.224 --> 15:46.844
Thanks for coming to help.
I wanted to.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.404
I think it's nice
what you're both doing.

15:48.464 --> 15:52.004
Well, I mean, Daniel mostly.
It was his idea. What a catch!

15:52.064 --> 15:53.684
Do you think it'll work?
Yes.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.604
Maybe it's what Janine
would have wanted.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.884
I'm guessing, because
I've never met her, but...

15:59.864 --> 16:01.124
Thanks.

16:01.184 --> 16:03.564
Are you guys getting any weird vibes
off this chair?

16:03.624 --> 16:06.524
You think it's haunted?
Why would you haunt a chair?

16:06.584 --> 16:08.244
Comfy?

16:08.304 --> 16:09.764
What's Greg doing here?

16:09.824 --> 16:12.444
Oh, Rosehaven doesn't have a priest.
He was the closest I could find.

16:12.504 --> 16:15.244
I mean, he wears a uniform.
And he listens to confessions.

16:15.304 --> 16:17.324
Very different.
Hmm.

16:17.384 --> 16:18.764
GREG: Hello, all.
ALL: Hi.

16:18.824 --> 16:20.084
Thanks for coming.

16:20.144 --> 16:23.124
That's OK.
Honestly, I'm a bit nervous.

16:23.184 --> 16:25.844
I've never really done
anything like this before.

16:25.904 --> 16:28.244
I didn't know Janine very well.
You're gonna be great.

16:28.304 --> 16:32.044
Just thank everyone for coming and
invite people to say a few words.

16:32.104 --> 16:33.044
Right.

16:33.104 --> 16:35.444
I'm gonna double-check there aren't
any more flowers in the house.

16:35.504 --> 16:36.924
I'll help.

16:38.344 --> 16:39.644
(GRUNTS)

16:44.864 --> 16:46.964
If I get married again,
I'm gonna throw two bouquets.

16:47.024 --> 16:48.284
Make them scramble.

16:48.344 --> 16:51.364
Hey, I heard you found a photo of me
in someone's house.

16:51.424 --> 16:52.604
Oh, yeah. Weird, right?

16:52.664 --> 16:54.644
Did Dan tell you
he was an ex of mine?

16:54.704 --> 16:56.804
Oh...yeah, think he did.

16:56.864 --> 17:00.004
I told Dan we went out for a bit,
it wasn't a big deal,

17:00.064 --> 17:01.764
but between you and me...

17:01.824 --> 17:03.644
No. Wait...
..I loved John.

17:03.704 --> 17:05.284
I thought he was the one.

17:05.344 --> 17:07.044
He decided to break it off with me,

17:07.104 --> 17:09.044
but I don't think I've ever stopped
having feelings for him.

17:10.424 --> 17:12.684
Grace! Why would you tell me that?!

17:12.744 --> 17:15.804
I had to tell someone.
Not his best friend, who is me!

17:15.864 --> 17:18.684
You can't tell ME that you're
in love with someone else.

17:18.744 --> 17:20.604
No, I-I love Daniel, I just...

17:20.664 --> 17:22.204
I can't keep secrets from Dan.

17:22.264 --> 17:24.564
Telling him other people's secrets
is one of my favourite things.

17:24.624 --> 17:27.404
They just come out.
Please don't. It'll just hurt him.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.684
I didn't tell Dan
because there's no point.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.844
I love him, but do I still
have love for John?

17:32.904 --> 17:35.804
Honestly, yes, I do. Is that wrong?

17:35.864 --> 17:39.244
I mean, no,
but yes that you told ME!

17:39.304 --> 17:41.924
I mean... Balls!

17:41.984 --> 17:44.244
I'm sorry.
It's just been in my head all day.

17:44.304 --> 17:46.924
And I don't have a close friend here
to share this kind of thing with.

17:47.944 --> 17:52.124
OK, I think you're awesome,
but, you know, our friendship...

17:52.184 --> 17:53.684
..it's SECOND tier.

17:53.744 --> 17:55.204
I understand.

17:55.264 --> 17:57.484
We can have secrets. Heaps of 'em.

17:57.544 --> 18:00.324
I've seen Dan naked four times
and he only knows about one of them.

18:00.384 --> 18:03.564
But you and I can't have secrets
this big about my best friend.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.244
I'm Team Daniel. I'm sorry.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.204
It's OK.

18:07.264 --> 18:09.164
I've put you in a weird position.

18:16.344 --> 18:17.964
I think having feelings for someone

18:18.024 --> 18:20.164
even though you're happy
in your current relationship

18:20.224 --> 18:21.804
is really normal.

18:21.864 --> 18:23.924
Thanks, Em.

18:25.144 --> 18:27.844
And you're right,
Dan would get upset.

18:27.904 --> 18:30.284
He doesn't appreciate
how great he is.

18:30.344 --> 18:33.084
I tell him, but I don't think
he believes me.

18:36.624 --> 18:39.124
Want to go host a wake
for someone we haven't met?

18:42.864 --> 18:46.204
Can we get started? I don't want
to risk Kit coming back.

18:46.264 --> 18:48.204
You ready to go, Greg?
Uh, yeah.

18:49.184 --> 18:50.684
(CLEARS THROAT)

18:53.424 --> 18:56.284
(CLEARS THROAT)
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.004
Uh, I'm not usually asked
to officiate at a wake,

19:00.064 --> 19:04.804
but the role of a police officer
is to serve and not ask questions.

19:04.864 --> 19:07.124
Anyway, uh...

19:07.184 --> 19:09.404
There were no
suspicious circumstances

19:09.464 --> 19:11.164
surrounding Janine's death.

19:11.224 --> 19:16.404
I'm told that she died very
peacefully in her favourite chair.

19:19.184 --> 19:21.684
Would anybody else
like to say a few words?

19:22.624 --> 19:24.804
What?
Just get the ball rolling.

19:26.144 --> 19:27.764
Um...

19:27.824 --> 19:30.884
I, uh, never met Janine, um,

19:30.944 --> 19:36.044
but when we first took over
this place, it was...very tidy,

19:36.104 --> 19:39.844
so...she must have been
a very tidy person.

19:39.904 --> 19:43.924
Um... Oh, and the landlord said she
was very prompt with her payments.

19:43.984 --> 19:47.164
OK, thank you, Daniel.
Beautiful words. Anyone else?

19:48.624 --> 19:50.164
Uh...

19:51.944 --> 19:55.684
I knew Janine for five years,

19:55.744 --> 19:58.124
and in all that time,

19:58.184 --> 20:02.044
she never once asked me
what my name was.

20:02.104 --> 20:07.244
I mean, I told her, of course,
but I was never sure if it stuck.

20:07.304 --> 20:09.524
MAN: Um, we lived next door,

20:09.584 --> 20:16.724
and my grandkids would accidentally
throw the frisbee over the fence.

20:16.784 --> 20:21.644
And she...well, she would always
refuse giving it back.

20:21.704 --> 20:24.764
This is different.
Yeah.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.444
Um, she nearly backed into me once,

20:27.504 --> 20:30.844
reversing out too fast despite
me telling her on several occasions

20:30.904 --> 20:33.924
that it was much safer
to back out slowly.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.924
And I wished at the time
that she would just...

20:38.064 --> 20:39.364
..pass away.

20:39.424 --> 20:43.524
And now that she has, I...
I feel like it's all my fault.

20:43.584 --> 20:45.404
I thought the same thing.

20:45.464 --> 20:50.284
Me too. I've been feeling guilty
about it ever since.

20:50.344 --> 20:52.764
(ALL MUTTER IN AGREEANCE)

20:52.824 --> 20:54.524
She was hard going.

20:54.584 --> 20:57.924
Well, perhaps we've been a little
too hard on ourselves here, then.

20:57.984 --> 21:00.484
I mean, look, we all tried
to reach out to Janine,

21:00.544 --> 21:04.124
but I...I think that she probably
just wanted to be left alone.

21:04.184 --> 21:06.004
A mean old bag, she was.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.684
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, thank you.

21:08.744 --> 21:10.564
Hi. Hi.

21:10.624 --> 21:12.084
What's going on?

21:12.144 --> 21:13.524
We're having a wake.

21:13.584 --> 21:17.724
Thank you very much for giving us
the opportunity to say goodbye.

21:17.784 --> 21:19.724
It really...it really did
mean a lot.

21:19.784 --> 21:22.404
Um, everyone back to mine
for a nightcap?

21:22.464 --> 21:24.004
Oh, great idea.
Good.

21:24.064 --> 21:26.764
I might take you up on that.
My nerves are shot.

21:26.824 --> 21:28.364
I did think it would be catered.

21:28.424 --> 21:30.404
Oh, Gareth!
I'm starving!

21:30.464 --> 21:32.884
And what about you, Kit?
Do you want to come back too?

21:32.944 --> 21:34.484
Let us welcome you
to the neighbourhood?

21:34.544 --> 21:36.444
Oh, no, thank you,
but that's very nice.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.204
Oh, OK. We'll leave you alone, then.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.084
OK. Thank you.

21:41.144 --> 21:43.004
See you. Bye.

21:45.624 --> 21:47.244
You're gonna get that chair
off my lawn, right?

21:47.304 --> 21:49.004
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah. We've had practice.

21:55.944 --> 21:58.124
Morning.
MRS MARSH: Morning.

22:09.624 --> 22:11.644
Oh, one second.
What?

22:12.784 --> 22:14.164
Nothing. All good.

22:14.224 --> 22:16.284
Are you googling him?
No.

22:16.344 --> 22:17.924
So, if I said
hold your hands up right now

22:17.984 --> 22:20.004
and I checked your browser history,
you weren't googling him?

22:20.064 --> 22:21.644
Uh...
Hold your hands up.

22:21.704 --> 22:24.204
I signed up to his mailing list.
Come on!

22:24.264 --> 22:26.084
I didn't think about him at all
last night,

22:26.144 --> 22:27.964
then I saw a sixpack of beer
on TV this morning

22:28.024 --> 22:29.484
and I thought,
"He's probably got a sixpack,"

22:29.544 --> 22:30.844
and I think I'm losing my mind.

22:30.904 --> 22:31.964
Stop.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.364
I spoke to Grace yesterday.

22:34.424 --> 22:35.924
Did you? What did she say?

22:35.984 --> 22:37.804
Do you really want to know?
Yeah.

22:37.864 --> 22:39.444
No.

22:39.504 --> 22:40.844
I don't know.

22:41.784 --> 22:43.204
Alright.

22:43.264 --> 22:45.764
Grace told me...
that John was nothing

22:45.824 --> 22:47.324
and you don't need to worry
about him.

22:48.264 --> 22:50.044
But he's amazing.

22:50.104 --> 22:52.404
Oh, this sucks.
What sucks?

22:54.424 --> 22:56.404
You're a good guy, OK?

22:56.464 --> 22:59.404
You listen and...
you're kind and silly

22:59.464 --> 23:01.284
and you don't know how rare you are,

23:01.344 --> 23:06.284
and Grace loves you so much
and...she's...very lucky.

23:09.224 --> 23:11.964
Thanks, Em.
You're a...you're a good friend.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.524
Oh, God, shut up! Ugh, I'll be sick!
I get it, I'm great.

23:14.584 --> 23:16.244
Can you please say it one more time
while I record it?

23:16.304 --> 23:18.204
No! Almost forgot.
Hmm?

23:18.264 --> 23:19.804
Let's settle this once and for all.

23:20.904 --> 23:25.324
Mrs Marsh, when you knock on a door,
how many times do you knock?

23:25.384 --> 23:27.404
Uh...two?

23:27.464 --> 23:29.164
Yes!

23:29.224 --> 23:32.004
But sometimes three
if they don't hear you?

23:32.064 --> 23:35.284
Oh...I suppose sometimes.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.284
Suck it.
You led the witness.

23:37.344 --> 23:38.564
Just asked a question.

23:38.624 --> 23:40.884
Well, I'm gonna start dancing again,
because I know that I'm right.

23:40.944 --> 23:43.004
Well, I'm gonna do a victory dance.
You can do a different dance.

23:43.064 --> 23:45.204
(KNOCKS TWICE) Hey!
Am I running a disco?!

24:05.864 --> 24:08.604
What's happening? I don't like
walking fast unless I have to pee.

24:08.664 --> 24:09.724
Here.

24:09.784 --> 24:11.164
What does "RRR" mean?

24:11.224 --> 24:14.284
"Redheaded rat-rooter".
(LAUGHS)

24:14.344 --> 24:17.004
I found your message in the cement.
Mate, I was 10.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.644
Jenny's coming.
Who's that?

24:18.704 --> 24:20.724
My sister.
Does she ride a motorbike?

24:20.784 --> 24:22.364
Is she a tattoo artist?
Body builder?

24:22.424 --> 24:24.684
Babs. So good to see you.

24:24.744 --> 24:25.964
"Babs"!

24:27.864 --> 24:31.204
GRACE: Well, I really hope
I die in my sleep.

24:31.264 --> 24:34.564
I want my last words to be...
"I'm so glad this doesn't hurt."

24:34.624 --> 24:36.524
Right.
"I'm so glad this doesn't hurt.

24:36.584 --> 24:38.364
"Thanks for all the awards."
OK.

24:38.424 --> 24:40.724
"I'm so glad this doesn't hurt,
thanks for all the awards,

24:40.784 --> 24:43.044
"and it's been an honour
to be your president."

24:43.104 --> 24:44.524
You done?
Yes.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.004
Shall we get some food?
Yes.

24:46.064 --> 24:48.684
Oh! "And I think I'll miss
my great abs the most."

24:50.264 --> 24:51.604
OK, I'm done.
