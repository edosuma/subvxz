01:13.838 --> 01:15.040
'Ey.

01:30.121 --> 01:32.454
You here for cheese pizza?

01:32.456 --> 01:33.490
Yeah.

01:34.693 --> 01:36.626
Where you heard about this?

01:36.628 --> 01:37.796
The park.

01:38.963 --> 01:40.765
You were trolling the park
at this hour?

01:42.901 --> 01:45.269
Ain't nothin'
but junkies and tweekers.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.770
You ain't gonna find
no pussy out there.

01:48.772 --> 01:50.806
Definitely not
no specialty pussy.

01:50.808 --> 01:53.042
You should just come to me
from now on.

01:53.044 --> 01:55.113
That is, if you got the cash.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.947
Nah, man.

01:58.949 --> 02:01.583
I've got something
extra special in there.

02:01.585 --> 02:03.620
You're gonna need to double
that at the very least.

02:06.356 --> 02:08.423
She's worth it, my guy.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.358
Matter of fact,

02:10.360 --> 02:13.462
you should just turn back
the way you came.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.897
'Cause once you taste
something this pure,

02:15.899 --> 02:17.366
this young...

02:18.367 --> 02:20.035
...you'll be ruined.

02:20.037 --> 02:21.535
How young?

02:21.537 --> 02:22.938
Too young.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.639
Too sweet.

02:24.641 --> 02:26.975
And worth way more than
what I'm charging so...

02:32.615 --> 02:34.515
Hold on, boss.

02:34.517 --> 02:36.084
There's a customer in there
right now.

02:36.086 --> 02:37.685
I just heard him finish up,

02:37.687 --> 02:39.154
so he'll be out any minute.

02:39.156 --> 02:40.690
Just hang out
for a little bit.

02:43.326 --> 02:45.659
I like your money, man.

02:45.661 --> 02:46.861
You need meds?

02:46.863 --> 02:48.896
I got uppers,
I got downers.

02:48.898 --> 02:50.198
I got high quality...

03:40.216 --> 03:42.215
Not again. Please.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.139
The average age for girls

04:41.141 --> 04:44.812
who're trafficked for sex
in this country is 11.

04:46.113 --> 04:48.313
11 little years old.

04:48.315 --> 04:50.749
And it happens every day.

04:50.751 --> 04:53.819
They're trafficked all over,
including our back yards.

04:53.821 --> 04:57.089
But the media asks us to put
our focus on other things.

04:57.091 --> 04:59.925
More rights for lazy,
entitled Americans,

04:59.927 --> 05:02.493
more equality
and more free stuff.

05:02.495 --> 05:04.762
They want us to spend
precious court time

05:04.764 --> 05:06.564
and law enforcement resources

05:06.566 --> 05:10.168
to keep promiscuous women
safe from revenge porn.

05:10.170 --> 05:13.671
The media demands
that we be outraged by racism

05:13.673 --> 05:14.672
which is,
by their account,

05:14.674 --> 05:16.807
the worst thing in the world.

05:16.809 --> 05:20.177
But are any of them
even talking about this?

05:20.179 --> 05:24.482
About innocent children
being trafficked for sex?

05:24.484 --> 05:27.919
Isn't that the worst thing?
Isn't that worse than racism?

05:27.921 --> 05:31.355
Shouldn't we be worried
about children's safety first?

05:31.357 --> 05:33.958
Maybe people would care more
if the kidnapped children

05:33.960 --> 05:35.893
had a good online presences

05:35.895 --> 05:38.796
with clever memes
on social media.

05:38.798 --> 05:42.066
Maybe hashtag nobody cares
about the children

05:42.068 --> 05:45.102
because the media
doesn't talk about it.

05:45.104 --> 05:47.972
You might consider me
a bad guy for saying this,

05:47.974 --> 05:51.608
but until every single child
on this Earth is safe,

05:51.610 --> 05:55.512
I don't care about any,
I mean anything else.

05:55.514 --> 05:59.383
In the mean time, police, the people who
are supposed to stop these scumbags

05:59.385 --> 06:01.051
from abducting kids,

06:01.053 --> 06:02.819
they drive right past
human traffickers,

06:02.821 --> 06:04.388
drug dealers and gang members

06:04.390 --> 06:07.057
so they can give yours truly
a ticket.

06:07.059 --> 06:08.291
That's right, folks.

06:08.293 --> 06:10.727
I got a ticket on my way
to work this morning.

06:10.729 --> 06:13.596
I said to the officer,
I said "Sir."

06:13.598 --> 06:15.465
Yes, I did call him sir.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.734
I said, "There's a house
a block away from my house

06:17.736 --> 06:20.637
that's dealing drugs
from their front porch."

06:20.639 --> 06:25.507
I said to the officer, "I'll take
this ticket with a smile on my face,

06:25.509 --> 06:27.576
if you let me take you
to this drug house.

06:27.578 --> 06:30.046
Observe the house
for at least five minutes

06:30.048 --> 06:32.581
and you'll see what the rest
of my neighborhood sees

06:32.583 --> 06:35.218
every single day.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.253
Then you can go in there
and you can arrest them."

06:37.255 --> 06:39.990
Of course, the cop wasn't
interested in doin' that.

06:39.992 --> 06:41.024
He just gave me the ticket

06:41.026 --> 06:43.025
and told me to have
a nice day.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.060
I guess it's safer
to give tickets to a man

06:45.062 --> 06:48.731
on his way to work
with an actual job

06:48.733 --> 06:53.104
for not coming to a complete stop on
a street that was totally empty...

06:54.705 --> 06:59.608
It's easier to do that than
actually stop real crimes.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.311
Where does that
leave us, people?

07:07.451 --> 07:09.420
Who's gonna protect us?

09:52.146 --> 09:53.379
Hi, Mama!

09:53.381 --> 09:54.547
Thanks, baby.

09:54.549 --> 09:55.947
Did I take too long?

09:55.949 --> 09:58.716
Depends.
Did you get me any chocolate?

09:58.718 --> 09:59.918
Yes.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.121
And you can have some
after you eat your lunch.

10:03.123 --> 10:04.756
Including the veggies.

10:04.758 --> 10:07.158
I knew you were
gonna say that.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.226
Are you hungry?

10:08.228 --> 10:09.227
No.

10:09.229 --> 10:11.095
And remember you said
we could take a stroll

10:11.097 --> 10:12.466
around the neighborhood
when you got back?

10:14.167 --> 10:15.969
Don't you wanna eat first?

10:19.172 --> 10:21.839
I saw a mama deer
with two babies this morning.

10:21.841 --> 10:23.308
Good.

10:23.310 --> 10:25.610
Better than at
our old neighborhood.

10:25.612 --> 10:28.780
Remember that crazy guy who kept
trying to break into our apartment?

10:28.782 --> 10:30.483
Ugh. How could I forget?

10:31.251 --> 10:33.117
That won't happen here, though.

10:33.119 --> 10:35.819
You don't have to worry about
those types of things anymore.

10:35.821 --> 10:37.188
You understand?

10:37.190 --> 10:38.722
Okay.

10:38.724 --> 10:42.093
But what about the coyote
who ate Mr. Fluffy?

10:42.095 --> 10:44.828
Well, that was...

10:44.830 --> 10:45.862
Can I get the mail?

10:45.864 --> 10:47.132
Yeah.

10:51.705 --> 10:53.904
You know what?
I would much rather deal

10:53.906 --> 10:55.473
with an occasional coyote.

10:55.475 --> 10:57.174
Mom!

10:57.176 --> 10:59.812
You said she wouldn't know
were to send these anymore.

11:06.518 --> 11:08.988
How did she find out
our new address?

11:45.323 --> 11:47.256
So, what's he sayin'?

11:47.258 --> 11:49.792
Said he's on his way.

11:49.794 --> 11:51.863
He made it past
airport security.

11:52.997 --> 11:54.563
He made it on the plane?

11:56.334 --> 11:57.933
Yup.

11:57.935 --> 11:59.368
Then we're cool.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.203
Tell him we'll
pick him up.

12:01.205 --> 12:02.373
All good.

12:05.543 --> 12:06.509
Done.

12:08.579 --> 12:10.179
My only question is...

12:10.181 --> 12:12.717
how we gon'-
how we gon' pay?

12:13.718 --> 12:16.654
We need, like,
500 more.

12:17.854 --> 12:20.356
What we'd need to do is hit some...

12:27.465 --> 12:29.032
You lost, sir?

12:36.440 --> 12:37.941
Yeah.

12:40.812 --> 12:42.279
We can help you out.

12:44.716 --> 12:46.981
How much money you got?

12:46.983 --> 12:48.185
Six.

12:49.286 --> 12:50.985
Six dollars?

12:50.987 --> 12:52.554
Bullets.

15:10.357 --> 15:12.524
Michael Jones
to the white courtesy phone.

15:12.526 --> 15:14.993
Michael Jones to the white
courtesy phone. Thank you.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.611
Flight 420
bound for Orlando, Florida,

16:07.613 --> 16:09.046
now departing from Terminal B.

16:09.048 --> 16:12.249
Flight 420
bound for Orlando, Florida,

16:12.251 --> 16:14.285
now departing from Terminal B.

16:53.458 --> 16:55.093
I don't know you, man.

17:26.290 --> 17:28.256
Can we get a paramedic
at Gate 6.

17:28.258 --> 17:30.527
Repeat, medical at Gate 6.

17:37.401 --> 17:39.836
Do you know what
a keister bunny is?

17:39.838 --> 17:41.503
Probably not.

17:41.505 --> 17:43.639
No reason for you to know
a slang term like that

17:43.641 --> 17:46.541
unless you've spent a lot
of time in prison.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.276
Well, hang on
to your pants there, folks,

17:48.278 --> 17:51.013
because a keister bunny is
a term used for somebody

17:51.015 --> 17:52.781
who is smuggling drugs.

17:52.783 --> 17:55.217
It's a tried and true method.

17:55.219 --> 17:59.388
These low-life's either
swallow baggies full of drugs

17:59.390 --> 18:01.723
or they cram them
up their keisters.

18:01.725 --> 18:03.825
Yup.
You heard me right.

18:03.827 --> 18:05.894
Last night at our
very own municipal airport,

18:05.896 --> 18:08.897
some guy who just flew
into the country was found

18:08.899 --> 18:10.599
convulsing on the floor

18:10.601 --> 18:12.801
because the baggies of drugs
in his belly

18:12.803 --> 18:14.970
accidentally ruptured somehow.

18:14.972 --> 18:17.639
He was pronounced dead
upon arrival to the hospital.

18:17.641 --> 18:19.941
Good riddance.

18:19.943 --> 18:22.343
Of course the police were
nowhere to be found.

18:22.345 --> 18:24.211
This was just
a happy accident.

18:24.213 --> 18:26.048
I did take a look
at the statistics

18:26.050 --> 18:28.382
of what the police
were up to last night.

18:28.384 --> 18:31.385
Seems like they did bust some
kid for selling some pot.

18:31.387 --> 18:33.754
But you wanna know
what the number one thing

18:33.756 --> 18:35.456
the cops were up to
last night,

18:35.458 --> 18:37.425
while this guy
was smuggling hard drugs

18:37.427 --> 18:39.960
right under their noses?

18:39.962 --> 18:42.063
The cops were busy
answering domestic calls.

18:42.065 --> 18:43.798
Average response time,
20 minutes.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.267
Talk about arriving too late.

18:46.269 --> 18:48.636
And the cops claim
to be such heroes

18:48.638 --> 18:50.938
for answering
these domestic calls.

18:50.940 --> 18:54.075
They claim that
they're so dangerous.

18:54.077 --> 18:56.077
But let me ask you this,
my people.

18:56.079 --> 18:57.611
Who sounds more dangerous
to you?

18:57.613 --> 19:01.247
Some truck driver who got
drunk and smacked his wife,

19:01.249 --> 19:03.150
the waitress wife
who broke a diner plate

19:03.152 --> 19:04.752
over her husband's head,

19:04.754 --> 19:06.989
or armed drug dealers?

19:08.290 --> 19:11.257
See, the cops like to pretend
to be heroes.

19:11.259 --> 19:14.227
That's why they wear
the uniforms and badges.

19:14.229 --> 19:17.430
But they would rather take some
drunk truck driver to jail

19:17.432 --> 19:19.599
as opposed
to hard criminals.

19:19.601 --> 19:22.435
The murderers. The rapist.
The drug dealers.

19:22.437 --> 19:24.771
People commit crimes
to get drugs.

19:24.773 --> 19:27.074
They kill each other
over drugs.

19:27.076 --> 19:29.642
They kill others to get drugs.

19:29.644 --> 19:31.311
So where were the cops?

19:31.313 --> 19:34.114
Busting a bunch of jerk-off
husbands and wives

19:34.116 --> 19:36.116
who got out of hand.

19:36.118 --> 19:37.283
You know,
most of those couples

19:37.285 --> 19:39.221
are gonna make up
the next morning.

19:40.321 --> 19:43.690
But still, the cops choose
to answer those calls

19:43.692 --> 19:46.559
because it keeps them
out of harm's way.

19:46.561 --> 19:49.829
They can go after the ultra-
dangerous squabbling couple

19:49.831 --> 19:52.232
as opposed
to dangerous criminals.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.432
Which is fine,

19:53.434 --> 19:56.736
if they wanna defend the wife
from getting a black eye,

19:56.738 --> 19:58.805
but what about the women
and children

19:58.807 --> 20:02.811
who are chained to beds
and used as sex slaves?

20:04.179 --> 20:07.846
Are they less deserving
of being rescued?

20:07.848 --> 20:11.151
How do the police
ignore murderers,

20:11.153 --> 20:13.886
kidnappers and rapists

20:13.888 --> 20:16.191
in lieu of
domestic violence calls?

20:17.892 --> 20:21.760
Answer the question, someone,
for me!

20:21.762 --> 20:25.364
The fighting husband and wife
choose each other.

20:25.366 --> 20:27.566
If the police
wanna impress me,

20:27.568 --> 20:30.669
they're gonna have to go after
some of the obvious criminals.

20:30.671 --> 20:33.639
Save the squabbling couple
from their marital problems

20:33.641 --> 20:35.874
after you've saved
women and children

20:35.876 --> 20:37.375
who are chained to beds

20:37.377 --> 20:41.914
and who are being raped by every
low-life in the tri-state area.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.514
What do you think, folks?

20:43.516 --> 20:45.017
What's more dangerous?

20:45.019 --> 20:48.686
A cop kicking down
a harden criminals door,

20:48.688 --> 20:50.923
or a squabbling
married couple's door?

20:50.925 --> 20:52.126
Ooh!

22:01.327 --> 22:02.494
Run.

22:04.329 --> 22:06.263
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

22:06.265 --> 22:09.833
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

22:09.835 --> 22:12.936
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

22:12.938 --> 22:14.606
Oh, shit...

23:24.241 --> 23:25.376
Excuse me!

23:27.944 --> 23:29.713
Wait! Wait!

23:37.854 --> 23:38.955
Is it you?

23:56.272 --> 23:57.307
It is you.

23:58.775 --> 24:00.542
I'm just a delivery guy.

24:08.884 --> 24:11.885
You're the man who's been
sending me this money.

24:11.887 --> 24:13.123
I'm sure of it.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.159
Why?

24:17.526 --> 24:18.961
That's all I wanna know.

24:20.162 --> 24:23.500
No... you don't.

24:26.336 --> 24:27.504
Have we met?

24:28.637 --> 24:30.971
Not that I recall.

24:30.973 --> 24:32.806
I certainly don't
know you well enough

24:32.808 --> 24:34.843
to deserve all this money
you've been sending.

24:37.246 --> 24:38.779
I should go.

24:41.216 --> 24:42.583
Please.

24:43.318 --> 24:45.252
This-this mystery'd been...

24:45.254 --> 24:47.553
kinda driving me crazy.

24:47.555 --> 24:49.024
It's just a gift.

24:51.527 --> 24:53.095
Just a gift?

24:55.297 --> 24:58.365
You've given me so much money
over the last couple of years

24:58.367 --> 25:01.203
that I was able to put
a down payment on a house.

25:03.305 --> 25:06.107
This isn't just a gift.

25:07.141 --> 25:10.643
You've-you've given
my daughter and I a home.

25:10.645 --> 25:12.180
A life.

25:16.984 --> 25:19.385
Can I just at least offer you
a cup of coffee?

25:19.387 --> 25:20.953
Or tea?

25:20.955 --> 25:23.055
My daughter is at school
right now.

25:23.057 --> 25:24.859
I just want to talk.

26:04.565 --> 26:06.532
I made Earl Grey.

26:06.534 --> 26:09.336
It's hot. Thought we might
need to let it cool for a while.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.707
Sorry about the mess.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.677
I don't usually have company.
It's just my daughter and I.

26:20.713 --> 26:21.848
I know.

26:24.351 --> 26:25.517
You know...

26:30.357 --> 26:32.392
Um... I guess you do.

26:39.166 --> 26:41.734
You probably know
everything about us and...

26:42.835 --> 26:45.470
...the only thing I know
about you is your name.

26:45.472 --> 26:46.606
My name?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.475
Well, not your real name.

26:50.477 --> 26:51.911
Um...

26:54.246 --> 26:56.949
My daughter and I call you
the fairy godmother.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.890
We wrongly assumed a woman
was sending us the money.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.262
What is your name?

27:13.731 --> 27:15.265
Good tea.

27:15.267 --> 27:16.602
Thanks.

27:29.047 --> 27:30.249
I'm glad you like it.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.086
Nice property.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.122
Thanks to you.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.435
I don't know.

27:52.437 --> 27:56.272
We've been here for a couple
of months now and...

27:56.274 --> 27:58.674
...as nice
as all this is...

27:58.676 --> 28:00.977
...sometimes I wonder if I
made the wrong decision

28:00.979 --> 28:02.779
in choosing this place.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.283
How so?

28:08.219 --> 28:11.354
All this open space...

28:11.356 --> 28:13.155
It's nice.

28:13.157 --> 28:14.158
Inviting.

28:16.361 --> 28:20.095
I think it gives my daughter
the urge to run.

28:20.097 --> 28:24.132
Which normally would be a good
thing for a little girl to do,

28:24.134 --> 28:27.002
but actually, um, she's...

28:27.004 --> 28:28.138
I know.

28:31.308 --> 28:32.374
You know?

28:37.147 --> 28:38.847
Listen, Mister.

28:38.849 --> 28:41.850
Please understand.

28:41.852 --> 28:43.587
I'm trying to connect
with you.

28:45.555 --> 28:47.188
This money you send,

28:47.190 --> 28:48.757
it means everything to us.

28:48.759 --> 28:51.328
I'm extremely grateful
to you but...

28:52.795 --> 28:55.999
...at the moment,
I'm curious as to why.

29:00.370 --> 29:02.572
I do some questionable things.

29:05.676 --> 29:07.808
And giving you money
helps me...

29:07.810 --> 29:09.178
...even things out.

29:13.916 --> 29:15.117
I should go.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.556
What is that?
What the hell?

29:21.558 --> 29:23.223
What are you doin'?

29:23.225 --> 29:26.026
Look at your eyes.
Look at those beautiful eyes.

29:26.028 --> 29:27.494
Like you're on somethin', baby.

29:27.496 --> 29:28.429
- I'm not on anything.
- Don't you see that?

29:28.431 --> 29:29.598
No!

29:31.200 --> 29:32.366
Go on.

29:32.368 --> 29:33.600
Move!

29:36.372 --> 29:37.239
Right, look.

29:38.274 --> 29:40.107
I need you to go build
a bonfire, all right?

29:40.109 --> 29:42.076
A campfire.
Something like a distraction.

29:42.078 --> 29:43.713
Okay? All right.

29:50.486 --> 29:52.053
Well, well, well.

29:55.658 --> 29:58.059
If it isn't Young Billy...

30:01.062 --> 30:02.798
...here in the flesh.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.100
Heard you wanted to see me.

30:06.669 --> 30:08.571
Well, yeah. I do.

30:09.437 --> 30:12.305
My son's hearing
didn't go too well.

30:12.307 --> 30:14.374
In fact, it went really bad.

30:14.376 --> 30:17.977
It seems the witness
showed up in court.

30:17.979 --> 30:21.616
You remember him? The one you
were supposed to get rid of?

30:23.685 --> 30:26.119
You're right. I wanted to
talk to you about that.

30:26.121 --> 30:28.855
There's no more talking.
Talking time is over.

30:28.857 --> 30:31.457
Now it's atonement time.

30:31.459 --> 30:33.092
You know what that means?

30:33.094 --> 30:35.094
Wait-wait a minute.

30:35.096 --> 30:36.562
I ran into some problems!

30:36.564 --> 30:38.431
Some serious issues, man.
Come on, just...

30:38.433 --> 30:40.633
I know what you did.

30:40.635 --> 30:42.968
You pissed yourself,
you little chickenshit.

30:42.970 --> 30:46.138
You pissed yourself,
and now my son...

30:46.140 --> 30:48.810
...he's goin' to prison
for life.

30:49.677 --> 30:51.376
Oh...

30:51.378 --> 30:52.946
and Torch...

30:53.615 --> 30:55.648
It's really your fault.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.182
You vouched
for the little prick.

30:57.184 --> 30:59.484
Said he was
a stone-cold killer.

30:59.486 --> 31:00.919
Fuck you, man.

31:00.921 --> 31:03.388
Hey, I fuckin' thought
he was, boss.

31:03.390 --> 31:05.090
I am.
I can kill.

31:05.092 --> 31:06.158
- Believe me, I can...
- Bullshit!

31:06.160 --> 31:07.993
Shut the...
Shut him the fuck up.

31:09.831 --> 31:11.263
Hold him tight.

31:11.265 --> 31:12.764
I'm gonna cut
his little dick off,

31:12.766 --> 31:14.866
throw it in the fire.

31:14.868 --> 31:16.535
No, please! Come on!

31:16.537 --> 31:18.238
I just got married!
I have a wife!

31:19.072 --> 31:20.238
I'll do whatever you want!

31:20.240 --> 31:21.675
I can kill for you!

31:22.843 --> 31:25.510
No, you can't.
You won't.

31:25.512 --> 31:27.712
I can kill anyone you want
right now.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.614
Hey, come on, boss.

31:29.616 --> 31:32.384
You cut this guy's dick off,
I'm gonna be sick.

31:32.386 --> 31:34.388
Let him do the guy.

31:34.987 --> 31:36.755
The guy...

31:36.757 --> 31:38.122
The guy in the back?

31:38.124 --> 31:41.158
- Yeah.
- It's too late for that.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.894
He won't do it.

31:42.896 --> 31:44.729
I can-I can do it.
I can kill him!

31:44.731 --> 31:46.030
I'll kill anyone you want
right now.

31:46.032 --> 31:46.997
Please!

31:46.999 --> 31:48.501
I don't believe you.

31:52.205 --> 31:53.372
Let's see.

32:08.154 --> 32:09.388
All right.

32:12.925 --> 32:17.095
Show me...
Show me you're a killer.

32:19.699 --> 32:20.900
A real killer.

32:22.435 --> 32:23.603
I will.

32:25.605 --> 32:26.873
Can I, uh...

32:27.473 --> 32:29.405
Can I get a gun?

32:29.407 --> 32:32.910
A gun? What the fuck
is he talkin' about?

32:32.912 --> 32:34.511
Quit bein' a fucking punk,
Billy!

32:34.513 --> 32:36.381
Do what the fuck you're told!

32:45.892 --> 32:46.993
Use that.

32:47.894 --> 32:49.459
Show me you're a killer.
A real killer.

32:49.461 --> 32:51.127
Baseball bat!

32:51.129 --> 32:53.029
- So...
- Now or never, Billy.

32:53.031 --> 32:55.298
Who... who is this guy,
anyways?

32:57.769 --> 32:59.869
Just some fucking nigger!
Why?

32:59.871 --> 33:01.804
Why don't you do
your fucking shit?

33:01.806 --> 33:03.138
It's him or you!

33:03.140 --> 33:04.607
Fuckin' do it, Billy.

33:04.609 --> 33:06.276
Do it!

33:06.278 --> 33:07.443
Quit being a fucking bitch,

33:07.445 --> 33:09.280
and hit that motherfucker!

33:10.015 --> 33:11.213
Do it!

33:13.451 --> 33:14.853
Come on!

33:18.289 --> 33:19.791
Damn.

33:24.996 --> 33:26.798
Now we got a killer here!

33:43.981 --> 33:46.116
Well...

33:47.551 --> 33:49.751
- You did it.
- I did it!

33:49.753 --> 33:51.186
You sure did.

33:51.188 --> 33:53.087
You're a killer, Billy.

33:53.089 --> 33:54.188
I did it.

33:54.190 --> 33:56.123
- That's the way to get it done.
- I'm a killer.

33:56.125 --> 33:59.361
We don't need to underestimate
you, do we, Billy?

33:59.363 --> 34:00.831
You did your business.

34:02.633 --> 34:04.600
You told me, Billy.

34:04.602 --> 34:06.668
Yeah, you did.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.072
Have a seat.

34:09.237 --> 34:10.571
I told you.

34:10.572 --> 34:13.139
I'm a...
I'm a stone-cold killer.

34:13.141 --> 34:14.476
Yeah...

34:16.045 --> 34:17.411
You did it.

34:17.413 --> 34:19.148
You're a man of your word.

34:21.150 --> 34:22.251
Shit.

34:23.219 --> 34:26.687
The proof is in
this cherry pudding here.

34:29.492 --> 34:30.658
I'm a man of my word.

34:30.659 --> 34:32.793
Yeah, you are!

34:32.795 --> 34:33.828
You know what?

34:33.830 --> 34:35.896
And I thought
you were trickin' us.

34:35.898 --> 34:37.998
- I did.
- Nope.

34:38.001 --> 34:41.134
Actually, I'm the one
who's trickin' you.

34:42.938 --> 34:44.239
What?

34:47.175 --> 34:50.043
Let's take a closer look
at this cherry pie.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.779
- Why not?
- What?

34:51.781 --> 34:53.683
What?!

34:57.720 --> 34:59.352
Dad?

34:59.354 --> 35:01.421
Dad?! No!

35:01.423 --> 35:03.256
Please, God, no!

35:03.258 --> 35:05.926
Oh!

35:05.928 --> 35:08.328
Oh, Daddy.

35:08.330 --> 35:10.196
Daddy!
And you know the worst part?

35:10.198 --> 35:12.232
No!

35:12.234 --> 35:13.800
Dad!

35:13.802 --> 35:15.735
Your dad...

35:15.737 --> 35:17.604
was a square guy.

35:17.606 --> 35:20.774
He worked at that
textile plant, for what,

35:20.776 --> 35:22.375
20, 30 years?

35:22.377 --> 35:24.844
Just to put food
on the table for you.

35:24.846 --> 35:26.546
He was a good guy.

35:26.548 --> 35:28.548
And you killed him.

35:28.550 --> 35:30.719
With a baseball bat!

35:31.953 --> 35:33.586
Your own father!

35:33.588 --> 35:35.287
You piece of shit!

35:35.289 --> 35:36.158
Dad!

35:37.358 --> 35:41.260
Oh, how are you gonna explain
this to your mama, boy?

35:41.262 --> 35:43.295
Huh, boy?

35:43.297 --> 35:44.798
Sons of bitches!

35:44.800 --> 35:46.365
How could you?

35:46.367 --> 35:48.668
How could we?

35:48.670 --> 35:50.302
Are you kidding me?

35:50.304 --> 35:51.771
You remember my son?

35:51.773 --> 35:54.273
He's going to prison
for the rest of his life

35:54.275 --> 35:55.474
because of you, Billy.

35:55.476 --> 35:56.810
Huh? You remember that?

35:56.812 --> 35:59.812
Oh, and guess what.
Your payback...

35:59.814 --> 36:02.148
...it ain't even started.

36:02.150 --> 36:04.383
No, it's not over yet.

36:04.385 --> 36:05.250
Mm-mm.

36:05.252 --> 36:08.489
Can we see what's behind
Door Number One?

36:14.662 --> 36:18.597
Me and my boys
are gonna have a little fun

36:18.599 --> 36:20.632
with your old lady.

36:40.620 --> 36:42.388
When I'm done with her...

36:43.323 --> 36:45.126
...I'm gonna take
this gasoline...

36:46.493 --> 36:48.793
...and pour it down
your fuckin' throat...

36:48.795 --> 36:50.528
...and set your guts
on fire!

36:50.530 --> 36:52.133
You got that?!

37:36.910 --> 37:39.210
Fucking kill him, man!

37:39.212 --> 37:41.212
I don't know him.

44:49.266 --> 44:51.466
Wait, stop!

44:51.468 --> 44:54.104
Please just let me go!

44:55.838 --> 44:57.472
You've seen my face.

44:57.474 --> 45:00.442
I won't say anything, I swear.
Just let me go.

45:00.444 --> 45:01.777
Not good enough.

45:03.746 --> 45:05.480
Okay, listen.

45:05.482 --> 45:07.482
I swear I won't
say a word.

45:07.484 --> 45:08.951
I won't say anything!

45:10.654 --> 45:11.887
Please.

45:19.195 --> 45:20.361
Shoot him.

45:20.363 --> 45:21.764
Fuck you!

45:24.300 --> 45:25.332
Why?

45:25.334 --> 45:26.800
Why? Just let me
call the police.

45:26.802 --> 45:27.635
Fuckin' do it.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.036
Fuckin' do it yourself.

45:29.038 --> 45:30.871
I can't do it.
Please.

45:30.873 --> 45:32.673
No choice.

45:32.675 --> 45:34.541
You fucking coward.

45:34.543 --> 45:36.878
I can't murder someone.

45:37.747 --> 45:39.846
All right?
Somebody call the police.

45:39.848 --> 45:41.315
I can't do it!

45:41.317 --> 45:43.150
I won't say anything.

45:43.152 --> 45:44.318
Just let me go.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.719
Please, please.

45:45.721 --> 45:46.786
Okay?

45:46.788 --> 45:48.054
Okay?!

45:48.056 --> 45:49.155
Fuckin' whore!

45:49.157 --> 45:51.090
You fuckin' dirty-ass whore!

45:53.362 --> 45:54.861
Fuckin' do it!

45:54.863 --> 45:55.995
Pull the trigger.

45:55.997 --> 45:57.999
Fuckin' shoot me, then, bitch!

46:00.168 --> 46:01.537
Fuck you, whore!

46:04.105 --> 46:06.808
Fuckin'-fuckin' do it!

46:08.276 --> 46:11.344
Fuckin' shoot me, then,
you stupid whore!

46:11.346 --> 46:12.578
Fuckin' do it!

46:12.580 --> 46:14.080
Fuckin' shoot me!

46:14.082 --> 46:17.150
Fuckin' shoot me!
Fuck you!

46:40.274 --> 46:42.076
Now I can believe you.

46:59.728 --> 47:01.962
Did you at least
ask his name?

47:03.664 --> 47:05.799
I did,
but he wouldn't tell me.

47:06.934 --> 47:10.237
Is he short or tall
or regular?

47:11.105 --> 47:12.738
Regular, tall.

47:12.740 --> 47:15.407
Is he skinny or fat
or regular?

47:15.409 --> 47:17.177
Uh, regular.

47:18.145 --> 47:20.245
What else?

47:20.247 --> 47:22.349
Um, I'm not sure.

47:23.817 --> 47:27.918
I still don't know his name,
or his number, or...

47:27.920 --> 47:29.623
why he's giving us
all this money.

47:32.826 --> 47:36.262
Maybe he's doing it because
he's in love with you.

47:38.097 --> 47:39.930
I don't think so.

47:39.932 --> 47:43.704
I do. Besides, someone should
be in love around here.

47:45.471 --> 47:46.937
Um,

47:46.939 --> 47:49.707
I'm the only person old enough
to be in love here, missy.

47:49.709 --> 47:51.609
You're 10.

47:51.611 --> 47:53.881
It wouldn't matter
if I was 20.

47:55.248 --> 47:57.782
What's that supposed to mean?

47:57.784 --> 47:59.118
You know.

48:00.119 --> 48:02.021
No, I don't.

48:03.756 --> 48:05.023
Tell me.

48:05.892 --> 48:06.857
I'm crippled, Mom.

48:06.859 --> 48:08.124
No one's ever gonna
fall in love with me.

48:08.126 --> 48:09.796
I can't even walk.

48:18.905 --> 48:20.205
Well...

48:20.840 --> 48:21.841
I love you now...

48:22.842 --> 48:25.275
...and I'll love you
even after you grow up

48:25.277 --> 48:27.545
and get married.

48:33.185 --> 48:35.318
Get out.
I mean it.

48:35.320 --> 48:38.721
I still got a restraining
order says you can't be here.

48:38.723 --> 48:41.026
I can't stay away
from you, baby.

48:43.228 --> 48:45.397
I guess I love you too much.

48:47.199 --> 48:49.365
That's bullshit
and you know it.

48:49.367 --> 48:50.966
You don't love me.

48:50.968 --> 48:52.402
You're just running
from the law again,

48:52.404 --> 48:54.337
and you don't got no place
better to go.

48:54.339 --> 48:55.874
I got a place to go.

48:57.876 --> 49:01.009
And I ain't runnin'
from the damn law.

49:01.011 --> 49:03.078
Not this time.

49:03.080 --> 49:05.715
I'm runnin' from some...

49:05.717 --> 49:09.119
crazed maniac with a mustache.

49:10.555 --> 49:13.222
Keeps comin' after me,

49:13.224 --> 49:15.925
and I have no fuckin' clue
as to why.

49:15.927 --> 49:17.559
Wait. Who?

49:17.561 --> 49:19.161
Just some nutjob.

49:19.163 --> 49:20.028
I don't even know
who he is.

49:20.030 --> 49:21.997
Look what he did
to my goddamn arm.

49:21.999 --> 49:23.833
He shot me.

49:23.835 --> 49:26.403
And you know what?
I just came here...

49:31.108 --> 49:32.710
...'cause I love you, baby.

49:33.544 --> 49:34.745
I missed you.

49:38.082 --> 49:39.617
I got presents.

49:42.920 --> 49:44.588
So, be nice.

49:46.290 --> 49:47.725
Hmm?

49:48.259 --> 49:49.725
Put it away.

49:49.727 --> 49:51.460
Come on, now.

49:51.462 --> 49:53.695
Didn't I always take care
of you?

49:53.697 --> 49:55.430
You know how long it took me
to get clean,

49:55.432 --> 49:56.932
you son of a bitch!

49:56.934 --> 49:58.065
Clean?

49:58.067 --> 50:00.671
Pressure washer
couldn't keep you clean.

50:08.077 --> 50:09.780
Fuck you.

50:21.891 --> 50:23.860
I know you're out there.

52:05.593 --> 52:07.928
I wasn't sure
if you were coming back.

52:09.563 --> 52:11.899
I didn't wanna leave this
in your mailbox.

52:13.100 --> 52:16.568
Well, this gives me a chance
to thank you for once.

52:16.570 --> 52:18.072
Please don't.

52:20.908 --> 52:23.274
It's too bad my daughter's
at school.

52:23.276 --> 52:24.612
She wants to meet you.

52:29.416 --> 52:31.717
Do you have a big dog?

52:31.719 --> 52:33.052
A dog?

52:33.054 --> 52:34.220
No.

52:37.424 --> 52:38.589
No, um...

52:38.591 --> 52:42.293
It's probably a coyote
that's been around here.

52:42.295 --> 52:44.462
He ate our cat.

52:44.464 --> 52:45.665
Do you have a gun?

52:47.801 --> 52:49.134
No.

52:49.136 --> 52:51.304
No, I wouldn't even know
how to use one.

52:52.439 --> 52:53.406
Wait here.

52:57.310 --> 52:58.411
Are you leaving again?

53:02.015 --> 53:04.247
Just going to my car
to get something.

53:04.249 --> 53:05.284
Okay.

53:10.289 --> 53:12.456
Can you stay for lunch?

53:20.599 --> 53:22.234
How about if I insist?

53:25.905 --> 53:27.506
Well, in that case...

53:28.440 --> 53:29.708
Yes.

53:33.645 --> 53:34.713
Come in.

53:40.953 --> 53:42.354
Is that a keyboard case?

53:44.723 --> 53:46.523
How'd you know?

53:46.525 --> 53:49.126
My ex was a musician.

53:49.128 --> 53:51.194
Salsa music.

53:51.196 --> 53:52.731
Do you play piano?

53:53.832 --> 53:55.801
Sadly, no.

53:57.536 --> 53:58.704
Oh?

54:11.016 --> 54:13.218
Well, uh, please,
have a seat.

54:31.836 --> 54:34.273
Um, I hope
you like vegetables.

54:36.073 --> 54:37.506
I'm kind of trying
to overcompensate

54:37.508 --> 54:38.741
as a mother

54:38.743 --> 54:42.178
and I pretty much only cook
healthy food for my daughter.

54:42.180 --> 54:43.514
Overcompensate?

54:46.284 --> 54:47.552
Yes.

54:49.954 --> 54:51.854
It's...

54:51.856 --> 54:56.091
just that I used to make
bad life choices,

54:56.093 --> 54:57.261
as they say.

55:00.898 --> 55:02.131
I was a party girl.

55:02.133 --> 55:04.701
I Liked drinking
and getting high.

55:06.870 --> 55:09.737
And I guess, now that...

55:09.739 --> 55:11.372
...you're finally here,
in person,

55:11.374 --> 55:12.909
you should know the truth.

55:15.612 --> 55:19.747
It might make you want
to stop sending us money...

55:19.749 --> 55:21.219
When you hear what I did.

55:22.953 --> 55:28.189
But I always said if I...
ever met you I'd tell you.

55:28.191 --> 55:29.824
So...

55:29.826 --> 55:31.926
you know exactly who you're...

55:31.928 --> 55:33.597
being so charitable with.

55:38.935 --> 55:41.669
You send us this money
because you think we're...

55:41.671 --> 55:43.606
victims of circumstance.

55:44.708 --> 55:48.111
My daughter being paralyzed
by a random bullet.

55:49.445 --> 55:50.746
But...

55:51.647 --> 55:53.316
...the truth is...

55:54.416 --> 55:57.451
I was on my way
to my dealers house.

55:57.453 --> 55:59.820
I had Isabel with me

55:59.822 --> 56:02.391
because I was
an irresponsible mother.

56:03.926 --> 56:06.227
And before we could knock
on the door,

56:06.229 --> 56:08.198
we heard gunshots from inside.

56:09.899 --> 56:13.767
My dealer was involved in a
shootout with some people inside.

56:13.769 --> 56:16.405
We turned to run away but...

56:17.273 --> 56:19.106
...a bullet
went through the door

56:19.108 --> 56:21.310
and hit my little girl
in the spine.

56:25.948 --> 56:27.648
She'll never walk again

56:27.650 --> 56:28.951
and it's my fault.

56:33.188 --> 56:34.323
An accident.

56:37.759 --> 56:39.328
I wish I could believe that.

56:41.964 --> 56:45.831
I didn't tell you so you'd
make me feel better.

56:45.833 --> 56:48.569
No one can.
Trust me.

56:56.345 --> 56:58.212
That was her
before the shooting.

57:23.938 --> 57:25.039
Keep it.

57:26.840 --> 57:28.343
I have lots of that one.

57:34.349 --> 57:36.614
Um, sorry about all that.

57:36.616 --> 57:37.716
Um...

57:37.718 --> 57:40.085
Can we reset,
change the subject, please?

57:40.087 --> 57:41.389
Anything.

57:43.957 --> 57:48.028
Um, like, for example,
I still don't know your name.

57:52.733 --> 57:55.633
Come on, don't
leave me hanging here.

57:55.635 --> 57:57.437
At least give me the initials.

57:59.206 --> 58:00.240
K.

58:03.777 --> 58:07.245
K. Is that the initial?

58:07.247 --> 58:08.448
Yes.

58:11.785 --> 58:13.987
Well, that's not vague,
Mr. K.

58:16.423 --> 58:18.758
Better get used to mysteries
around you.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.725
Um, so...

58:21.727 --> 58:23.794
The case.
I know it's not a piano.

58:23.796 --> 58:24.964
What's in there?

58:33.340 --> 58:34.673
For your coyote.

01:01:01.585 --> 01:01:04.985
Okay, I have to go pick up
my daughter from school.

01:01:04.987 --> 01:01:06.322
You wanna go with me?

01:01:08.224 --> 01:01:09.358
I can't.

01:01:10.594 --> 01:01:11.961
I understand.

01:01:12.962 --> 01:01:14.428
I mean, I don't, but...

01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.932
I guess you're not ready
to meet her.

01:01:19.168 --> 01:01:20.935
I should go.

01:01:20.937 --> 01:01:22.338
Can you come back tomorrow?

01:01:26.976 --> 01:01:28.142
If you're not ready
to meet her,

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:29.776
just come by
between nine and two.

01:01:29.778 --> 01:01:31.045
She'll be at school.

01:04:37.028 --> 01:04:39.162
- Give me the motherfuckin' cash right now!
- Oh, shit!

01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:41.166
I'll murder your ass, nigga!

01:04:46.238 --> 01:04:47.936
Gimme the motherfuckin' money!
You understand?!

01:04:47.938 --> 01:04:49.205
You understand
my fuckin' round?

01:04:49.207 --> 01:04:50.340
Give me the cash now!
Come on!

01:04:50.342 --> 01:04:52.442
- I don't have the money!
- Where did you put it?!

01:04:52.444 --> 01:04:53.942
I just work here, man.

01:04:53.944 --> 01:04:55.177
The
came an hour ago.

01:04:55.179 --> 01:04:57.514
Look motherfucker, I'mma blow
your motherfuckin' head off

01:04:57.516 --> 01:05:00.317
if you don't empty the cash
register. Where is it?!

01:06:43.185 --> 01:06:45.151
The door's unlocked.

01:06:45.153 --> 01:06:46.421
Come in.

01:07:08.043 --> 01:07:09.845
I think I understand...

01:07:13.215 --> 01:07:14.349
...why you help.

01:07:26.428 --> 01:07:28.262
Am I what you want?

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:34.970
I thought this
was what you wanted.

01:07:37.104 --> 01:07:38.872
I'm just trying
to understand why.

01:07:38.874 --> 01:07:40.374
I already told you.

01:07:44.612 --> 01:07:45.946
You said you give us money

01:07:45.948 --> 01:07:48.347
to make up for some things
you do

01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:50.885
but you've never told me
what you do.

01:07:52.553 --> 01:07:54.620
If you know what I do,

01:07:54.622 --> 01:07:57.189
you'll never
want to see me again.

01:07:57.191 --> 01:07:59.460
Not true.
Talk to me.

01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:13.806
We live in a world where
humans are safer than ever.

01:08:13.808 --> 01:08:15.441
We're out of the food chain.

01:08:15.443 --> 01:08:18.309
We have technology
that helps us live longer.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.812
No plagues.

01:08:19.814 --> 01:08:21.345
We should all rejoice

01:08:21.348 --> 01:08:24.716
on what a great time it is
to be alive.

01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:29.054
But what about those of us who still
fall victim to violent crime?

01:08:29.055 --> 01:08:31.790
The police walk right past
obvious-looking criminals

01:08:31.792 --> 01:08:35.326
because they claim
to not have probable cause.

01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:37.161
The cops are told
as we are told,

01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:39.031
not to judge people.

01:08:39.033 --> 01:08:41.366
Judge people by their looks?

01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:42.533
Sure.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:45.370
What if you have no other
information to go on?

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:47.705
What if it's a safety issue?

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.707
It's popular to say, "No.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.576
Don't be judgmental.

01:08:51.578 --> 01:08:54.144
You can't judge a guy
that looks like a criminal

01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:58.049
because what if he's the one-in-a-million
guy who's turned his life around?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:09:00.718
What if you were just
a normal guy like me

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.487
and you're walking
down a lonely street

01:09:02.488 --> 01:09:05.221
and you notice there's a lady
walking in front of you?

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.024
Should she judge me?

01:09:07.027 --> 01:09:09.526
I'm just some guy
walkin' behind her.

01:09:09.528 --> 01:09:11.194
I'm not gonna mug her.

01:09:11.196 --> 01:09:13.865
Why be judgmental?
Why judge me?"

01:09:13.867 --> 01:09:16.600
Now, if our ancestors
thought that way,

01:09:16.602 --> 01:09:20.037
humans would've gone extinct,
the way of the dodo bird.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:22.738
We would've smiled
at the snakes in the grass

01:09:22.741 --> 01:09:24.374
and tried to pet it because...

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:27.277
it's unfair to assume
the snake is dangerous.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:30.647
It's racist to assume
the snake is poisonous

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:33.684
just because
he's a snake, right?

01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:35.886
And it's not just a race thing.

01:09:35.888 --> 01:09:37.621
None of us is afraid
when we get approached

01:09:37.622 --> 01:09:40.424
by a Mexican landscaper
or businessman.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.792
But if we get approached
by a Mexican

01:09:41.794 --> 01:09:43.393
who looks like a gangbanger,

01:09:43.395 --> 01:09:44.560
with a low rider,

01:09:44.563 --> 01:09:46.630
tattoos on his face
and a hoodie.

01:09:46.631 --> 01:09:48.999
We do worry.
I would.

01:09:49.001 --> 01:09:50.701
Does that make me judgmental?

01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:54.437
Sure, it means I used
my best judgment.

01:09:54.439 --> 01:09:56.773
Let me tell you
a little story.

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:58.809
Not too far back, a mother
was taking her baby

01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:00.110
for a little stroll.

01:10:00.112 --> 01:10:03.446
She was approached by two
young African American men.

01:10:03.448 --> 01:10:05.281
They both looked
like street thugs but...

01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:09.052
she didn't want to run away, she
didn't wanna scream for help.

01:10:09.054 --> 01:10:11.420
She didn't want to seem
like a racist

01:10:11.422 --> 01:10:14.256
who was judging people
based on their appearance.

01:10:14.258 --> 01:10:15.825
One of those guys mugged her.

01:10:15.827 --> 01:10:18.594
The other shot her baby
in the face.

01:10:18.596 --> 01:10:20.563
He killed
her one-year-old baby

01:10:20.565 --> 01:10:23.232
by gunshot
in between the eyes.

01:10:23.234 --> 01:10:24.602
Bam!

01:10:26.137 --> 01:10:27.538
True story.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.574
And the killer was spared
the death penalty.

01:10:31.576 --> 01:10:34.043
Even though he killed a baby,

01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:36.479
he was only sentenced to life.

01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:40.116
A life of food and shelter
by the state prison system.

01:10:40.118 --> 01:10:43.418
I guess it would have been
racist of us as a society

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.855
to give the death penalty
to a young black man

01:10:45.857 --> 01:10:51.326
when all he did was kill
a blond, white, male baby.

01:10:51.328 --> 01:10:52.895
Oh, and by the way.

01:10:52.897 --> 01:10:56.397
There were no protesters in the
streets calling for justice,

01:10:56.399 --> 01:10:59.367
not for this white
privileged male baby.

01:10:59.369 --> 01:11:00.635
No, sir.

01:11:00.637 --> 01:11:03.538
And what about
the poor people of color

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.673
who don't turn to crime?

01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:07.308
The ones who get up
and go to work

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:09.178
and make an honest living?

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.014
Does the government help them?

01:11:12.015 --> 01:11:14.183
No.

01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:16.217
They just hit just them
for taxes.

01:11:16.219 --> 01:11:19.154
But for thieves, rapists
and the murderers,

01:11:19.156 --> 01:11:22.289
we give them three meals a day
in an air conditioned cell

01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:24.492
with health care
and dental care

01:11:24.494 --> 01:11:27.128
so that we can all
feel good about ourselves

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:30.432
for being so civilized
and non-judgmental.

01:11:32.602 --> 01:11:34.669
We would save
more innocent lives

01:11:34.671 --> 01:11:36.971
by publicly hanging murderers,

01:11:36.973 --> 01:11:39.406
as a matter of fact,
we should sell tickets,

01:11:39.408 --> 01:11:41.508
as opposed to jailing them.

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.778
Execution would
be a real deterrent.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.183
Some say, we don't have
the right to take a life.

01:11:48.185 --> 01:11:49.250
But by that logic,

01:11:49.252 --> 01:11:52.953
maybe we should risk
more innocent lives.

01:11:52.955 --> 01:11:54.421
Put more babies at risk

01:11:54.423 --> 01:11:58.058
so that society can feel
righteous about itself.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:11:59.229
Or...

01:12:00.563 --> 01:12:03.130
...should we do the reverse?

01:12:03.132 --> 01:12:06.600
Should we do the reverse...

01:12:06.602 --> 01:12:09.770
and take matters
into our own hands?

01:12:09.772 --> 01:12:13.674
An eye for an eye
isn't just revenge.

01:12:13.676 --> 01:12:16.579
It helps prevent future crimes.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.179
What if-

01:12:19.181 --> 01:12:22.182
what if there was a champion
for the innocent?

01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:25.551
Someone who took all of
the risk to keep us safe?

01:12:25.553 --> 01:12:27.921
Someone to deliver
the kiss of death

01:12:27.923 --> 01:12:30.458
to the scumbags out there?

01:12:31.492 --> 01:12:32.594
Hmm.

01:12:34.263 --> 01:12:37.396
Someone who can shoulder
all of the guilt

01:12:37.398 --> 01:12:42.171
and make the hard decisions
so that we don't have to?

01:12:44.405 --> 01:12:47.039
Could such a person exist?

01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:48.808
If he could,

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:50.643
would you want him?

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:54.182
Food for thought.

01:12:56.184 --> 01:12:57.650
That's all for tonight, folks.

01:12:57.652 --> 01:13:00.086
Thanks for joining me.
I'm Dan Forthright

01:13:00.088 --> 01:13:04.325
and you've been listing
to Justice Radio.

01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:14.033
Cops haven't grabbed you yet?

01:13:14.035 --> 01:13:15.469
Have something for me?

01:13:17.372 --> 01:13:18.472
I think so.

01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:20.942
That dealer, Tyrell.

01:13:21.842 --> 01:13:23.610
I know where he is.

01:13:27.981 --> 01:13:29.083
You know...

01:13:30.251 --> 01:13:32.786
It's only a matter of time
before they catch us, now.

01:13:34.521 --> 01:13:35.689
I don't care.

01:13:37.191 --> 01:13:38.625
We're doin' God's work.

01:13:47.534 --> 01:13:48.568
Cigarette?

01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:50.804
No.

01:14:09.222 --> 01:14:11.655
A little birdie told me
where he is.

01:14:11.657 --> 01:14:13.325
There's a lot
of civilians around.

01:14:13.327 --> 01:14:16.161
You can't go in shootin'
the place up.

01:14:16.163 --> 01:14:18.196
You gotta follow him

01:14:18.198 --> 01:14:20.332
and take him out
when you're alone.

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:21.667
Capiche?

01:14:22.436 --> 01:14:23.869
We understand.

01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:28.839
We?

01:14:28.841 --> 01:14:32.044
Me... and him.

01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:38.382
That last son of a
bitch who stole from me?

01:14:38.384 --> 01:14:39.717
Remember that?

01:14:39.719 --> 01:14:44.355
Came back and it was a bloody
rope and a skeleton, that's it.

01:14:45.490 --> 01:14:48.192
I guess animals ate his ass.

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:54.031
But you gotta love it
out here, huh?

01:14:57.036 --> 01:15:00.404
That fresh air?
Aw, I love it. I love it.

01:15:00.406 --> 01:15:02.572
You know, the only thing you
gotta be afraid of out here

01:15:02.574 --> 01:15:04.274
are the animals.

01:15:04.276 --> 01:15:06.843
You know, I'm talking
mountain lion,

01:15:06.845 --> 01:15:08.046
whatever.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.847
When you come out here,

01:15:10.849 --> 01:15:13.816
you're part of
the food chain again.

01:15:13.818 --> 01:15:15.084
Remember that?

01:15:15.086 --> 01:15:17.954
Hm, you got that?
You are.

01:15:17.956 --> 01:15:19.724
That's why I brought this.

01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:21.893
Oh...

01:15:22.894 --> 01:15:25.395
...and I also brought...

01:15:25.397 --> 01:15:26.896
...this.

01:15:26.898 --> 01:15:29.465
A little barbecue sauce, hm?

01:15:29.467 --> 01:15:31.434
Smell it.
Aw, smells good, don't it?

01:15:31.436 --> 01:15:33.171
Mmh, yeah.

01:15:34.172 --> 01:15:37.073
We're gonna invite
some company around here.

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:38.875
Hey, you know, a wolf

01:15:38.877 --> 01:15:42.245
can smell something a mile
and-a-half away in the cold.

01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:43.712
Not to mention the bears,
hell,

01:15:43.714 --> 01:15:45.849
they can smell something
20 miles away.

01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:50.886
Now, I don't know if any
of this is true but...

01:15:50.888 --> 01:15:53.189
Wait, wait, wait.
What am I talkin' about?

01:15:53.191 --> 01:15:55.458
The bears, they are all still
in hibernation.

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.994
So all you gotta worry about are
the mountain lions or the wolves.

01:16:03.368 --> 01:16:05.334
Fuck you, man!

01:16:05.336 --> 01:16:06.804
Fuck you.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:10.941
Aw man, got that arm shot up.

01:16:11.742 --> 01:16:14.445
Fuck! Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:16:15.813 --> 01:16:18.013
That should do the trick.

01:16:18.015 --> 01:16:19.281
Ugh. Fuck you.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:20.982
Bye bye, beaner.

01:16:20.984 --> 01:16:24.286
Fuck you, fuck you!
Fuck! Fuck you!

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.556
Fuck!

01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:27.456
All right, boys,

01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:29.159
we need to get
the hell outta here.

01:16:30.094 --> 01:16:33.061
The smell
of this barbecue sauce

01:16:33.063 --> 01:16:35.896
is definitely gonna
attract predators.

01:16:35.898 --> 01:16:36.965
I'm already here.

01:17:18.773 --> 01:17:21.242
Hey! Help!

01:17:24.813 --> 01:17:26.082
Help!

01:20:40.138 --> 01:20:43.606
Oh, my leg.
Oh, my fuckin' leg.

01:20:47.612 --> 01:20:49.512
My leg! Ah!

01:20:49.514 --> 01:20:52.281
Ah, you fuckin' shot me.
Didn't you?

01:20:55.086 --> 01:20:57.254
Son of a bitch.

01:21:01.158 --> 01:21:03.058
It's you.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:04.995
Why the fuck...

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:08.397
Why are you always
comin' after me?

01:21:08.399 --> 01:21:09.633
Huh?

01:21:10.601 --> 01:21:13.237
You already tried to kill me
three times.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.740
I don't even know
who the fuck you are.

01:21:17.742 --> 01:21:19.742
Remember the first time?

01:21:19.744 --> 01:21:21.946
The first time what?

01:21:24.782 --> 01:21:26.617
First time
you tried to kill me?

01:21:27.518 --> 01:21:28.817
Yeah.

01:21:28.819 --> 01:21:30.452
You shot up my house,

01:21:30.454 --> 01:21:32.456
killed two of my friends.

01:21:35.493 --> 01:21:37.026
I barely escaped that.

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:40.564
You were selling drugs
out of that house.

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:44.265
I'm not Jesus.

01:21:44.267 --> 01:21:46.367
Maybe I was.

01:21:46.369 --> 01:21:49.540
That's my job, asshole.

01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:53.908
While you and I were shooting
at each other...

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:57.614
...one of our bullets
went through your front door.

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.918
Maybe my bullet.
Maybe yours.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.155
I don't know.

01:22:06.990 --> 01:22:09.090
The bullet...

01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:10.727
hit this little girl.

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:13.861
She's paralyzed now.

01:22:16.199 --> 01:22:18.635
I don't even know
who she is.

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:27.142
We both deserve to die.

01:22:29.846 --> 01:22:31.681
My day will come soon.

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.751
It's only a matter of time.

01:22:54.904 --> 01:22:56.536
No, no, don't do that. No.

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.104
No, no, man.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:23:00.073
No, don't.
Don't do it.

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.074
Don't... Look.

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.677
Look. Why don't we just

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.779
get rid of all this craziness.
All right?

01:23:05.781 --> 01:23:06.880
Huh?

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:09.216
Come on. why don't you just
take me to the police.

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:11.418
Let the law enforcement
take care of it, you know.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.185
You know?
Come on, man!

01:23:13.187 --> 01:23:16.255
The law, the law.
Let 'em take care of it.

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:16.957
The law.

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:18.460
No law.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.697
Justice.

01:23:23.364 --> 01:23:25.765
Come on! Come on!

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.872
It's crazy!
You're crazy!

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.505
Come on!

01:25:17.179 --> 01:25:22.179
