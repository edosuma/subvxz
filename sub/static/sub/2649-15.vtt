WEBVTT

00:04.588 --> 00:06.636
Whoa.
What's all this?

00:06.715 --> 00:09.013
- Mom heard us say we were bored.
- Suckers.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.311
She heard us from outside.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.639
She has super good hearing,
like a Seeing Eye dog.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.942
They have overdeveloped hearing
to make up for the fact-

00:17.017 --> 00:18.690
Wait. The dogs aren't blind.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.271
Wait. Are they?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.733
No, that wouldn't make sense.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.443
You're right. If I wait long enough,
she can get there by herself.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.414
Quick, girls. Famous
Danny from Moonstruck.

00:30.489 --> 00:31.957
Aiello.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.579
Hey, Phil,
I'm glad I caught ya.

00:33.659 --> 00:34.706
What's up ?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.537
Uh, it's about
Steven and Stefan.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.418
They want' to see that' house
on Briar again.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.999
Really? I showed it to 'em five times.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.880
Last time we were there,
I think they got mail.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.087
Yeah, well, that's why I'm calling.
They hate upsetting people.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.671
Unless, of course, it's me.

00:45.754 --> 00:48.132
Then they don't mind waking me
at 7:00 a.m., asking me to call you.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.183
It's no problem.
I'm just hanging around.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.932
Kind of bored, really.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.513
What?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.644
Well, we did
our good deed for the day.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.942
Yeah, for the enemy.
Don't they have enough?

00:59.017 --> 01:02.237
It's been about a year since
we decided to adopt a boy.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.816
Meanwhile, our friends Steven and Stefan
decided that they wanted a baby too.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.367
Wonder where
they got that idea.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.036
Well, we're still waiting,
but they already got their kid,

01:10.112 --> 01:11.785
because they went through
a surrogate.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.490
Which is all
they talk about.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.868
Are you gonna keep doing that?
I might.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.708
I have to go show a house. But first, what was
Elton John's sexual orientation in the '70s?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.007
Bi.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.051
- You've done that one before.
- And it never gets old.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.425
Like the good
Captain Fantastic himself.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.058
Hey, Claire, guess what? I'm sorry,
honey, I can't talk right now.

01:31.133 --> 01:34.182
I told Bethenny I would take her to the airport.
I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.184
Where are my keys?
Why is that chair still here?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.391
I thought you and Luke were gonna
put it out on the sidewalk.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.101
So you can't talk,
unless it's about my chores.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.528
Why don't you just do it now
and you won't be so bored.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.240
You heard that?
I hear everything.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.488
That's for me.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.457
Hey, Leon.
Nice buzz cut.

01:55.532 --> 01:58.251
Yeah, for some people,
the shampoo doesn't work.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.830
It only makes
the lice angry.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.835
Nice to see you.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.258
Oh, no. No.
Oh, God.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.633
Um, Alex, do not move.
Haley, clean this up, okay?

02:08.711 --> 02:10.339
Who fills a vase
with marbles?

02:10.422 --> 02:12.925
Who doesn't see a vase
filled with marbles?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.510
Who wants to hear
a bunch of plates crashing?

02:14.593 --> 02:17.142
Phil! Honey, the girls
need you in the kitchen.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.939
Thanks for the hat, Leon.
Kind of tickles.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.733
Phil!

02:21.808 --> 02:24.311
How much electricity
do we need to bring this back?

02:24.394 --> 02:27.398
It's not rocket science. We're
only reanimating a squirrel.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.700
Phil! Now!

02:30.442 --> 02:32.285
# Hey, hey #

02:32.361 --> 02:34.409
# Hey, hey #

02:34.488 --> 02:36.490
# Hey, hey #

02:36.573 --> 02:38.450
# Hey, hey #

02:38.533 --> 02:39.705
# Hey ##

02:42.913 --> 02:44.711
Sounds great.
No, hang on.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.292
Gloria, where's Manny?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.594
Some neighborhood kids have
invited him to play football.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.138
He said he was taking
his morning constitutional.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.682
He's workin' on his go-kart,
but he'll be there.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.555
Okay, see you then.

02:55.634 --> 02:58.353
No, Manny cannot
go and play with those boys.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.227
Margo is trying to get us
theater tickets for this afternoon.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.933
Gloria, you and Manny
do enough together.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.893
Let's let him decide.
Where's he walking?

03:04.976 --> 03:07.604
I don't know. But according to
the song he was singing,

03:07.688 --> 03:09.736
he was going to
the sunny side of the street.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.194
I cannot express to you enough
how bad this kid needs football.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.619
Mom, look what I found!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.663
Number 99!

03:16.738 --> 03:19.241
When Manny was five,
we didn't have much,

03:19.324 --> 03:20.826
we were on our own,

03:20.909 --> 03:22.957
so we always dreamed
of winning the lottery.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.165
We figured if we collected
100 lucky heads-up pennies ...

03:26.248 --> 03:28.501
and bought a ticket with them,
we couldn't lose.

03:28.583 --> 03:32.508
But now, I have a wonderful
husband, a beautiful home.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.056
I feel like I already
won the lottery.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.305
So I can keep
whatever we win?

03:37.384 --> 03:40.012
I think no.
I found most of them.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.482
Can you put this in the jar
with the others?

03:46.309 --> 03:49.153
A y, I forgot. What is the
combination to your safe?

03:49.229 --> 03:52.199
Uh-
I'll just come with you.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.244
Oh, yes, 'cause that's how this arrangement works.
I take money from you.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.081
Hello.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.535
Oh, hi, Margo. No, no,
she just ran upstairs.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.619
Listen, about these
theater tickets.

04:04.703 --> 04:08.207
Don't knock yourself out
tryin' to- Oh, you did.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.009
Well, sorry to do this last minute,
but they can't go.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.049
No, Manny has a football game,
so-

04:13.128 --> 04:16.177
Jay, could you steep my tea?

04:17.673 --> 04:21.224
I cannot express to you enough
how much this kid needs football.

04:21.303 --> 04:25.900
And that is the whole house.
Again.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.318
I love it,
but I just don't love it.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.688
Do you love it? I love it.
I absolutely love it.

04:30.812 --> 04:34.191
I'm just not sure if I'm
in love with it. Oh, yeah.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.699
We have an expression around the office
for when a sale just isn't happening-

04:37.778 --> 04:39.826
commission impossible.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.537
Maybe for some people.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.539
Not sure if I mentioned it
before,

04:44.659 --> 04:48.334
but the house does come with a hookup
for a European washing machine.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.790
Oh, I love that.

04:49.873 --> 04:53.503
Oh, so sorry.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.671
It's the boss.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.341
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm on my way home.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.052
I've been calling Haley, but nobody's answering.
ls everything okay there?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.183
Everything here is great.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.390
Oh, thank God. Did you
put the chair out front?

05:06.515 --> 05:09.018
Not yet. Honey, you're gonna
miss the trash pickup.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.852
Don't worry. if they don't
take it, someone else will.

05:10.936 --> 05:13.439
Who is gonna pick up
that ratty chair off our lawn?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.195
Are you kidding?
It's in great shape.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.822
Super cozy. People are
always commenting on it.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.995
Trust me, it'll be gone
by the end of the day.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.947
- Please just do it now.
- I can't.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.532
I'm so sorry.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.788
When I'm done with these clients,
I'll call Luke and Leon.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.494
I know I can
talk them into it.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.454
We are not losing this house
to Luke and Leon.

05:29.538 --> 05:32.382
What do you mean, "call Luke and Leon"?
Aren't you at home?

05:32.457 --> 05:33.879
No, I left
right before you did.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.429
Phil, the hou-
The-The kids.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.006
Oh, God, the squirrel.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.763
Hello?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.310
We'll take it.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.932
Oh.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.606
Commission ... accomplished.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.821
So how great is your life right now, huh?
A new house, new baby.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.773
Stefan's Propecia's kicking in.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.861
Oh. That's him.
He's on his way.

05:59.943 --> 06:03.368
He texted "O.M.W." We try to keep our texts
short when we're driving with the baby.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.494
Oh, well, what wonderful
parents you are.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.043
You guys hate us
a little bit, don't you?

06:08.159 --> 06:10.127
No. God, no.
Yeah, just a little.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.420
Have you thought
about surrogacy?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.248
At least you'd be
making a baby,

06:13.331 --> 06:16.426
instead of waiting around for some
pregnant morn to maybe pick you.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.754
Well, we considered it, but how
do you decide which one will-

06:18.879 --> 06:20.176
Where's Lily?
Sleeping.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.256
Ice the cupcake?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.137
That you couldn't
say in front of Lily?

06:23.258 --> 06:24.976
Well, then she'd want a cupcake.
Yeah.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.725
- But that's the beauty of the swirl.
- The swirl?

06:27.804 --> 06:30.648
You both donate.
They mix it up, fertilize the egg,

06:30.724 --> 06:32.772
you never know
who the father is.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.853
Ooh, that's Stefan.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.940
You know, maybe we should
think about the swirl.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.243
Well, I-l didn't think Surrogacy
was for us, but, you know-

06:41.318 --> 06:42.991
'Cause one of us would
feel left out.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.867
Yeah, but if you don't know
whose it is-

06:44.946 --> 06:48.826
Sorry we're late.
Guys, meet Rocco.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.378
Rocco or cocoa?

06:54.623 --> 06:58.173
- Look at him out there.
- Oh, honey, this is so exciting.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.843
Go ahead! Attaboy!

07:02.964 --> 07:04.511
Go! Go ahead!
Go, Manny! Run!

07:04.591 --> 07:07.845
I knew Gloria would find out
I lied about those tickets,

07:07.928 --> 07:10.272
but I figured
when she saw Manny out there,

07:10.347 --> 07:13.442
playing with all those other
kids, she'd thank me.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.686
That's what I figured.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.146
Go, go!

07:17.270 --> 07:19.944
What the hell's he doin'?
Run, Manny, run!

07:20.023 --> 07:22.242
Mom, number 100!
Now we have the money-

07:36.081 --> 07:37.708
Oh, thank God.
Nobody's dead.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.715
Or we're all dead.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.047
- How many plates did we lose?
- None.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.757
Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to
clear a path through the marbles for me.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.184
- Where are the marbles?
- Right here.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.512
- Oh, Haley!
- I put glue on 'em so it doesn't happen again.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.974
- What about the chair?
- Leon and I rolled it outside on some skateboards.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.901
Oh.  The squirrel.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.900
You think I was going to
let that happen?

08:00.438 --> 08:04.693
These kids are going to survive.
They are the best of me and Phil.

08:04.776 --> 08:09.407
Luke using the skateboards, Haley
gluing the marbles- That is pure Phil.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.993
Alex keeping everyone in line?
Pure me.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.377
Sometimes I worry
no one's gonna like Alex.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.884
There you go, buddy.
Thank you.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.178
Uh- What? You need anything?
I'll get it.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.385
Steak sauce.
But it's okay.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.014
It's probably good for me
to move around.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.568
Oh, Jay, it's so nice to see you
take care of him like that.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.312
Why are you surprised? He's our kid.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.363
We take care of each other
in this family.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.317
I want to kill you.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.825
Wild guess- Margo.
Let me explain.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.031
There is no excuse.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.287
This is sounding private.
I'm gonna get out of here.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.460
So that's why you were
being so nice.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.333
You lied
to my friend.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.585
You made Manny
play the American football.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.837
It is your fault that
he got stampeded.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.427
Or is it your fault?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.470
He stopped to pick up a penny,
for God's sake.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.173
Be careful
what you say, Jay.

09:08.256 --> 09:11.305
You're skating on thin
eggshells right now.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.432
I tried to get him out there
with kids his own age,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.146
which is what he should
be doin'-

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
And not spending another
afternoon with his mommy.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.652
If you have a problem with the way
Manny's being raised, you talk to me!

09:20.769 --> 09:22.271
I am. I don't want to hear it!

09:29.444 --> 09:31.117
Phil, you really
didn't have to do this.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.575
I sold a house today because of you two.
The least I can do is buy you dinner.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.375
I saw that house.
It is gorgeous.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.044
I know. Yes. We're
real happy for them.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.918
They showed me a picture of the baby.
How adorable is that little guy?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.125
Yes, we're real happy
for them.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.381
Okay, you might want to
slow down there.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.962
I'm playing
a new drinking game.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.594
It's called "Every time I'm depressed,
I take a drink."

09:49.672 --> 09:51.891
That game exists.
It's called alcoholism.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.310
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're right.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.729
I'm-I'm wallowing,
and it's not cute.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.148
- To happier things.
- Yes.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.186
To happier things.
Happier things.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.650
There you go. Yes.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.399
I remember the first few drinks,

10:03.478 --> 10:06.903
and, urn, after that, the
night's just bits and pieces.

10:06.981 --> 10:11.327
I want to do something I never
do- brag about my kids.

10:11.402 --> 10:15.623
Today, they were resourceful.
They were responsible. They-

10:15.698 --> 10:17.450
Put 40% down.

10:17.534 --> 10:20.083
It was worth showing the house
five times and waiting-

10:20.161 --> 10:23.961
Almost a year. Seriously!
Who do you have to-

10:24.040 --> 10:27.260
Blow. That's really hot. Why don't you
let it cool down and try some of the-

10:27.335 --> 10:30.088
Mexican! The baby
is clearly Mexican.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.139
So, you know,
the swirl is out.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.513
Oh, it's enough
to make you lose-

10:34.592 --> 10:38.847
Track. Is this my fourth
drink, or is it my fourth?

10:38.972 --> 10:42.272
I just said fourth twice, didn't I?
I did, didn't I?

10:42.350 --> 10:46.150
I think we're gonna need four cabs.
Two! Two!

10:46.229 --> 10:47.776
You made me!

10:49.107 --> 10:52.407
L-I vaguely remember
someone crying.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.988
If we ever did surrogacy, I
would want you to be the donor.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.161
Mm-mmm. You're so smart.
You're so handsome.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.663
Oh, stop it. It should be you.
You're so fun.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.291
- You're so talented.
- Okay.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.840
It's not fair.
I love you both so much.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.840
If you could have a baby that was a mix of the
two of you, I would love that baby so much.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.092
- Stop it.
- Oh, that is so sweet.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.558
I meant it.
That is so sweet.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.011
Oh, my God, you guys,
we could do this.

11:18.094 --> 11:23.225
We could do this. We could make a baby
that is half Tucker and half Pritchett.

11:23.308 --> 11:26.107
Are you saying what I think
you're saying?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.275
Yeah.
Cloning?

11:28.354 --> 11:32.655
No, no. I'm saying ...
I give the egg.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.236
Oh!

11:34.319 --> 11:36.447
Yeah, I give the egg.
That's the Pritchett side.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.783
And then Cam,
you're the father, right?

11:39.866 --> 11:44.542
And then we just, like, mix it and put
it in a- like, a surrogate lady thing,

11:44.621 --> 11:46.498
and then, bang,
we have a baby.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.718
Oh! Are-Are you serious?
You would do that?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.591
I would be honored.
You guys.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.674
You guys, if there's one
thing I have learned today,

11:55.757 --> 12:00.012
it's the pleasure of looking at
your children and seeing both-

12:00.094 --> 12:01.596
both of you in there,

12:01.679 --> 12:03.556
and I want you to have
that experience.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.517
- We need that. We want that.
- Yeah.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.147
And something else.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.948
- Guys, I make really good babies.
- Yes.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.691
- I have magic eggs or something.
- Yes.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.027
- They're, like, golden.
- Oh, gosh.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.658
Oh, Phil, I don't- What do you-
What do you say about this?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.330
I think we're all
having a baby!

12:19.447 --> 12:21.745
Table hug!

12:23.368 --> 12:26.622
Sweet potato fries!

12:31.084 --> 12:32.677
What have I done?
I know.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.799
Oh.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.383
What was I thinking?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.764
I just get drunk, and I bring
a baby into the world?

12:40.843 --> 12:42.311
That would be
four for four.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.355
I can't go through with it.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.603
Don't panic. You haven't
donated anything yet.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.562
Besides, what are the chances
your eggs even work?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.817
What are the chances we can
pretend I never said that?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.240
It's weird.
it's my brother.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.615
And then there would be this baby over there
that's my baby, but it's not my baby-

12:57.694 --> 12:59.537
That actually sounds good.
Just say that.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.831
We're gonna see 'em for brunch
in two hours over at your dad's.

13:01.906 --> 13:06.457
Ooh, that seems soon ...
and-and hard.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.464
What if- What if
I blame it on you?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.918
What if we say that
you're not okay with it?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.423
" No!

13:14.502 --> 13:17.051
Are you really okay with another
man fertilizing your wife's egg?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.178
- Of course not. That's creepy.
- Yes.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.760
Plus, what if you and Cam make
a better baby than we did?

13:21.843 --> 13:25.313
It's settled.
Phil says no.

13:25.388 --> 13:27.732
Like they're really gonna
believe that I overruled you.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.351
Oh, right.
Come on.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.903
Mmm.
They're gonna be crushed.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.730
They've waited so long
for this baby.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.362
Maybe they're having
second thoughts too.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.570
Look. This is what my baby
with Claire would look like.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.075
What is this? What?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.876
Okay, well, I found a Web site
where couples can upload pictures,

13:45.950 --> 13:49.580
and then it shows 'em what their
baby would look like.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.630
This is Gloria and I.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.084
Couldn't resist.
Wow.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.885
That-That looks
exactly like Manny.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.088
Like-Like weirdly so.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.639
Wait, what's
this other picture?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.512
Don't be jealous.

14:01.591 --> 14:05.061
But this is me
and Justin Timberlake.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.231
Cam, we have a problem.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.568
Oh, what, you can talk about Ryan Gosling
all day, but the moment I say something-

14:11.642 --> 14:13.315
No, no, no.
About this baby.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.863
I don't think I can do it.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.737
What? Why?
Why? it's perfect.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.035
It's our chance to have a baby
that's part me, part you.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.238
No, no, it's part you
and part Claire.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.824
I'm nowhere in there. And
it's not like I can pretend.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.911
It's- She's not some egg donor
that we don't know. it's Claire.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.870
You know, we see her
all the time.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.207
And what are we supposed to tell the baby?
"Say hi to your Aunt Mommy."

14:34.290 --> 14:36.884
- Adorable.
- No, not adorable.

14:36.959 --> 14:37.960
Appalachian.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.260
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Cam.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.684
Jay says that I'm smothering
Manny, but I'm just enjoying him.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.936
I mean, they're only gonna
be boys for a short time.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.394
Best time ever
in this house!

14:54.477 --> 14:56.195
I'm uncomfortable
with this, Phil.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.364
The manual specifically
says "No towing."

14:58.439 --> 15:00.487
There are two types
of people in this world-

15:00.566 --> 15:03.490
people who follow the manual and
people who stick it to the manu-

15:03.569 --> 15:04.661
That hurt!

15:04.737 --> 15:07.035
Hi.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.368
- Manny, what happened?
- Football injury.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.623
My mom will "yell" you
all about it.

15:11.702 --> 15:16.458
Hola, Lily. Does my little
princess want a cookie?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.009
Oh, well, you know,
maybe just one.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.595
She's already had her sugar limit for today.
How can you tell?

15:20.711 --> 15:23.806
¡Ay! Okay, Lily.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.601
Hey.
Hey, you two.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.099
So, where-
Oh, where are the kids?

15:29.178 --> 15:31.021
Oh, Haley's driving them
over separately.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.599
Ohh.
Big girl now.

15:33.766 --> 15:34.858
That's right.  Yeah.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.528
So, that was
so fun last night.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.068
So fun. Yeah. We
had a great night.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.900
Yes.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.200
We should get that-

15:43.276 --> 15:45.278
Jinx.

15:45.361 --> 15:46.908
We're goin' this way, so-
350 for 30.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.831
See you in a bit.
That looks delicious.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.835
I cannot tell them.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.420
I cannot break their hearts.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.915
So you're gonna have Cam's baby just
to keep things from being weird?

15:56.998 --> 15:59.000
Um, what?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.131
You and Uncle Cam
are having a baby?

16:01.210 --> 16:05.135
Kids, shh. There was a discussion about the
possibility of your mom donating an egg ...

16:05.214 --> 16:06.761
so that the guys
could have a baby.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.764
But we decided
it was not a good idea.

16:08.843 --> 16:10.641
Why? Because
Lily's such a mess?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.722
For a lot of reasons.
They have to-

16:12.805 --> 16:15.274
But we can agree that she's a
disaster as a human being.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.478
- I think it's a great idea.
- Yeah.

16:18.561 --> 16:21.656
It's a really beautiful offer, Mom.
I'm impressed.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.733
Oh, my God. Cam!

16:23.816 --> 16:26.695
They told the kids already, and
they seem to be totally into it.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.200
Is it just me? Am I the only
one that thinks this is weird?

16:29.322 --> 16:33.702
Maybe it's not weird. Maybe we're pioneers.
No, we're hardly pioneers.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.878
You have three different hair dryers
for different types of weather.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.126
Maybe it's just gonna take some
time to get used to the idea.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.669
What idea?
Oh.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.126
Um, well, Jay-

16:41.250 --> 16:42.877
Cam.
Claire has-

16:42.960 --> 16:46.089
No. I- I just don't think my dad's
really ready for this conversation, so-

16:46.172 --> 16:48.300
Stop acting like
I'm some stodgy old coot.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.180
I've grown.  Okay.

16:50.259 --> 16:55.265
Um, Jay, Claire has offered
to give us one of her eggs,

16:55.348 --> 16:58.443
so we can have a baby that's
half Pritchett, half Tucker.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.192
That's unnatural.
I'm against it.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.865
Oh, surprise, surprise.
Jay's against something.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.909
Cam and Claire want to
have a baby together.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.657
Eww!
You're not gonna do that.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.159
It's not
your decision, Dad.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.156
You're not thinking straight.
And you're not in charge.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.742
Okay, Claire and I
are adults.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.203
If we want this to happen,
it's-it's gonna happen.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.128
So much for second thoughts.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.957
Young lady, I need to
have a talk with you.

17:21.082 --> 17:23.835
I don't- Now?  No!

17:23.917 --> 17:27.012
You don't get to tell everyone
how to live their lives,

17:27.088 --> 17:29.887
that boys cannot spend time
with their mommies ...

17:29.966 --> 17:32.469
or that brothers and sister
can't make babies.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.769
So you're all for this? No, it's a
freak show, but it's their freak show.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.101
So this is
happening again.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.983
Well, I'm not gonna not do it
'cause my dad thinks I shouldn't.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.108
I'm not following. We're not doing
it 'cause I don't want to do it.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.160
What we're not doing is not doing it
'cause he doesn't want us to do it!

17:49.277 --> 17:50.904
Just say baby or no baby.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.490
Isn't it enough this family
spends a lot of time together?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.041
Now we have to inbreed.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.040
Okay, Dad. it's not technically
inbreeding. it's, um-

17:58.119 --> 18:01.544
For the record, I think what
my mom is doing is very brave.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.876
I like it. I've always kind of
wanted a half-brother, half-cousin.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.757
- Really? Always?
- I mean, if you think about it-

18:06.877 --> 18:09.721
I disagree
with you about inbreeding, young lady.

18:09.797 --> 18:12.676
I would like to make a small presentation.
If everyone could-

18:12.758 --> 18:15.352
Once the neighbors find out,
and they will-

18:18.472 --> 18:22.352
Oh, wow. When was the last
time we talked under a table?

18:22.476 --> 18:26.026
Dad and Gloria's wedding reception.
Oh, yeah.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.573
Um, mmm-

18:27.648 --> 18:30.197
I love you. You know that.
But I can't do this.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.161
No, no, neither can I.
Really?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.576
Yeah. Are you serious?
You can't-

18:34.655 --> 18:36.123
Oh, God, I'm so relieved.
I'm sorry.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.748
L-I- Oh, I am so sorry
I led us down this road.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.329
No, no, Claire.
Don't be. Don't be.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.916
It was generous and thoughtful,
just like you.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.297
How could I not want
those qualities in my child?

18:47.418 --> 18:49.716
Ohh.
Oh, come here.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.885
Good brother. So this
is really happening?

18:52.006 --> 18:55.055
What if it is, Dad? Yeah, what if we love
each other and this is a beautiful thing?

18:55.176 --> 18:57.053
Okay, it's our decision.
it's not yours. Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.184
So- baby, no baby?

19:00.556 --> 19:02.433
No.
Mm-mmm.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.939
You okay?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.275
Oh, I know
it's been hard on you.

19:10.358 --> 19:12.235
Hey, what if we went out
for a nice dinner tonight?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.033
Oh, that'd be fun. Should
I call the sitter? Yeah.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.829
You know what I was thinking today?
What about Luke?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.203
Oh, he's so good with her,
the way he looks at her.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.743
Oh, my God, Cam.
Oh.

19:20.826 --> 19:23.079
She's organizing
her things.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.706
Look at how she's dressed.
Oh.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.381
We didn't make her,
but she sure is us.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.304
Hey, Lily. It might make
more sense with the shoes-

19:32.380 --> 19:33.882
Mitchell.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.261
I like what she did with the dolls though.
Play as you will.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.059
It's nice.
Play as you will.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.101
The bent one, remember?
One of the first ones we found.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.107
It was at the bottom
of the gutter in the street.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.407
A y, yes. We put the gum at the
bottom of your walking stick.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.075
Ay, look at this one,
the green one.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.370
- The one we found at the floor of my taxi.
- Your taxi?

19:56.445 --> 20:02.123
Yes. Before I had somebody running my life
for me, I used to drive a taxi at night.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.624
Manny would sleep
in the seat next to me.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.706
One time, I had to hit
the brakes so hard ...

20:06.789 --> 20:09.633
that he fell into the floor,
and he found the penny.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.507
Pretty lucky, huh?

20:11.585 --> 20:13.929
Eight years. I can't believe
we're finally done.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.475
Me, either.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.429
Come. Let's go
get your lottery ticket.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.524
Gloria, I think you
made a mistake here.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.105
What did I do now?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.941
I've counted these, and
you've only got 96 pennies.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.776
Are you sure?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.533
'Fraid so.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.080
I guess you're gonna
have to keep lookin'.

20:40.156 --> 20:42.409
Dang it!
I counted those.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.789
See for yourself.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.883
And now we upload
your picture.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.589
This is fun.
This is fun.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.551
Yeah. And in just a few short moments,
thanks to the magic of technology,

20:59.633 --> 21:01.260
we'll know what our
baby actually looks like.

21:01.385 --> 21:03.012
No, no.
What happened? What is that?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.847
Did you put one of us in
upside down?

21:04.930 --> 21:08.434
No, that's actually- Okay, I don't
want to see this anymore. Turn it off.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.403
Oh, it's not turning off. Throw
something over it, then. Oh, God!

21:11.479 --> 21:13.481
Yeah, well, we played God,
and look what we brought forth.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.066
Daddies,
what are you looking at?

21:19.320 --> 21:20.867
- Maybe it wasn't that bad.
- No, no.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.414
It's possible that
we overreacted.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.709
Yeah. Maybe our expectations
were just a little too high.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.377
The little guy had some
cute features, huh?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.079
Of course he did. it's us.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.755
It can't be that bad.
Let's just take a-

21:36.378 --> 21:37.379
English - US - PSDH
