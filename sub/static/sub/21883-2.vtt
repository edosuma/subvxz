We'll be waiting for your signal.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.586
All set.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.464
You'll decide when to throw the party.

02:26.312 --> 02:30.233
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>from my boiling blood</i>

02:30.483 --> 02:34.779
<i>I feel the fear sweat dripping away </i>

02:34.904 --> 02:39.200
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits </i>

02:39.534 --> 02:45.373
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:59.137 --> 03:03.558
<i>To unleash my return</i>

03:07.812 --> 03:11.566
<i>I have the dust</i>
<i>that protects the road </i>

03:11.983 --> 03:16.362

03:56.444 --> 03:59.781
I know you've had
a great career, Conrado.

04:00.073 --> 04:05.119
But what happened with the Avendaños
is unacceptable.

04:05.286 --> 04:08.039
The recent events are unfortunate--

04:08.665 --> 04:11.084
Maybe you're not getting the point.

04:11.918 --> 04:17.882
My team of assessors and I
feel we no longer need your service.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.178
It's your decision.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.515
And I respect that, Mr. President.

04:26.933 --> 04:31.980
I'd like to emphasize that dealing
with drug lords is a complex task.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.941
It requires a specific set
of skills and experience.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.652
That's something
you don't learn overnight.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.323
I wish you the best.

04:42.740 --> 04:48.079
Undoubtedly your skills
will be put to good use soon.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.661
So long, sir.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.705
See you soon.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.924
How can I be of help, sir?

05:42.091 --> 05:45.219
Chito... what would you do for me?

05:45.803 --> 05:48.514
Well... whatever you need, Don Joaquín.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.600
You've been so nice to me.

05:51.225 --> 05:53.436
I need you to help me
get out of here.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.983
Once I'm free, I want you to work for me.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.826
You can count on me. I'm with you.

06:10.036 --> 06:10.912
You sure?

06:11.829 --> 06:13.164
What do I have to do?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.042
What were you expecting?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.295
That they'd accept you so easily?

06:21.214 --> 06:24.217
Those assholes think
they'll change the system.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.762
They have no damn clue
how this country works.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.390
They hate us now.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.394
They don't want to negotiate,
that's normal.

06:35.895 --> 06:37.814
Wait for this to blow up.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.026
Waiting in politics can be deadly.

06:42.443 --> 06:44.445
Those who wait are quickly replaced.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.204
Who has the most influence
on the new president?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.209
She has tits and wears skirts.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.380
His wife.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.258
She treats him like an imbecile.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.554
May I talk freely?

07:10.012 --> 07:11.347
Please do.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.601
Me leaving is detrimental
for your husband.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.397
I accept that things in my department
are a mess, but...

07:20.982 --> 07:23.151
the years I've spent facing drug lords

07:23.234 --> 07:24.735
are not matched by anyone else.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.280
I'd hate to think that,

07:27.530 --> 07:30.783
being surrounded
by less experienced people,

07:32.368 --> 07:34.245
the president might be poorly advised.

07:37.123 --> 07:41.002
I know how valuable good advice is,
in the right moment.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.715
Don't worry, I'll talk to him
about your situation.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.260
Thank you very much.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.017
I won't waste any more of your time.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.936
I almost forgot.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.775
For being so kind to meet me.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.570
I hope it's your style.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.617
I love this designer.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.583
Your show better be a good one, bro.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.919
Because if you get caught,
you'll pay for it.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.546
-Come with me, bastard.
-Don't be stubborn, Joaquín.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.632
I'm not one that likes to be chased.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.094
You'll repeat
what I just told you.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.346
Word by word.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.314
-Got it?
-Got it.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.775
They'll give you instructions there.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.906
Well, gentleman,
I'm leaving before the fat lady sings.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.243
-OK.
-Good job, Damaso.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.411
-See you outside.
-See you.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.081
-Take care, Güero.
-See you.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.380

09:12.218 --> 09:14.804
-Thank you, Don Joaquín.
-No problem.

09:29.151 --> 09:30.236
Good luck, sir.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.240
-Look for me when you get out.
-I will, sir.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.744

10:03.561 --> 10:06.272

Erase the video
from the main patio as well.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.665
Yes?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.668
Tell the president that Chapo Guzmán
has just escaped from prison.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.395
Great to see you again!

17:43.520 --> 17:45.522
Glad to see you again, sir.

-Took you long enough, Joaquín.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.811
yet they want to take him
to the United States.

26:04.271 --> 26:07.023
<i>"El Chapo"'s whereabouts</i>
<i>are still unknown.</i>

26:07.107 --> 26:11.528
<i>Today Francisco Gamboa AKA El Chito,</i>
<i>turned himself in.</i>

26:11.611 --> 26:13.947
<i>The employee responsible</i>
<i>for "El Chapo"'s escape</i>

26:14.072 --> 26:15.615
<i>from Puente Grande's facilities.</i>

26:15.699 --> 26:18.076
<i>He claims he pushed the laundry cart</i>

26:18.159 --> 26:20.829
<i>where "El Chapo" Guzmán was hiding,</i>

26:20.912 --> 26:23.039
<i>all the way to the parking lot.</i>

26:23.123 --> 26:24.708
Bullshit.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.047
-I'm going to make the rounds.
-Hey!

26:31.172 --> 26:32.716
You won't go anywhere, Ramon.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.175
We agreed on something.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.511
We were only going to reinforce security,

26:36.594 --> 26:38.430
not going after him ourselves.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.348
If he comes to Tijuana, I'll find him.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.351
We can't get overconfident,
either we kill him...

26:44.352 --> 26:45.854
...or he kills us.

27:09.127 --> 27:13.465
EL CIELO RANCH
LA TUNA, SINALOA

27:18.219 --> 27:19.304
It's the boss.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.443
Mom.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.571
How are you, sweetheart?

27:37.447 --> 27:38.323
Welcome.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.784
How are you?

27:45.330 --> 27:47.457
-How are you?
-Good.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.418
Quino!

27:50.794 --> 27:53.380
QUINO
EL CHAPO AND ALEJANDRA'S SON

27:54.172 --> 27:55.882
You're so big. How are you, Moreno?

27:56.424 --> 27:58.009
MORENO
GRACIELA AND EL CHAPO'S SON

27:58.176 --> 27:59.928
Pollito, sweetheart.

28:01.429 --> 28:02.514
You're so big, you bastard.

28:04.974 --> 28:06.101
Let's get inside, come on.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.314
Oh, my...

28:15.610 --> 28:16.945
And Graciela?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.198
You know how uptight my mom is.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.867
To her, Alejandra is your only wife.

28:23.284 --> 28:24.577
Cheers, Pollito.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.329
Time to eat, guys.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.664
-Joaquín.
-Go on.

28:27.747 --> 28:29.165
Mom!

28:36.548 --> 28:37.924
I just came to hug you,

28:38.174 --> 28:39.759
for you to see I'm fine.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.972
How long will you be running
from place to place?

28:44.806 --> 28:47.100
Don't get sad.
Everything will be fine soon.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.727
Let's go.

28:50.353 --> 28:52.230
Your uncle told me that you want to get
in the business.

28:56.609 --> 28:59.070
Fine, then. You're old enough.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.114
Let me see who can train you.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.575
I want in too.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.746
You're still young.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.039
Finish your studies, then we'll talk.

29:30.560 --> 29:36.274
TAMAZULA
DURANGO, MEXICO

30:04.427 --> 30:06.387
Not even God can find us here.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.601
Sir? It's Ismael.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.066
Congratulations, you don't let
anything slip away from you.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.151
Chito's capture settled everything down.

30:20.401 --> 30:21.736
<i>Trust in me, man.</i>

30:21.820 --> 30:23.613
Now, we start the federation.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.701
DEA OFFICE
MEXICO CITY

30:49.764 --> 30:51.432
I want to return
to Los Pinos.

30:52.475 --> 30:57.021
My only in is to get information
to capture El Chapo.

31:07.282 --> 31:08.575
What about the Avendaños?

31:39.022 --> 31:42.150
CULIACAN, SINALOA
MEXICO

32:07.926 --> 32:09.844
ARTURO BERNAL LEYDA'S RESIDENCE

32:11.804 --> 32:13.264
<i>Things have changed, Joaquín,</i>

32:13.389 --> 32:15.183
<i>since you've been in the big house.</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:17.185
Let's go.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.688
Players change, not the game, Arturo.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.067
What the hell? Fucking Arturo.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.526
Make yourselves at home.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.822
I apologize for not letting you know
I was coming.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.492
I don't want to shake things up even more.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.372
I met you here because we all have
a common enemy.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.624
The Avendaños.

32:41.334 --> 32:44.796
I propose we start a federation.
As it was before.

32:45.296 --> 32:48.299
-Work together, under the same command.
-Yours?

32:51.761 --> 32:52.804
Mine.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.141
Peace and earnings for you all.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.728
A new deal with the government.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.357
That's my offer.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.443
What happened with Amado...

33:07.527 --> 33:08.611
it's over with him.

33:09.362 --> 33:10.697
I'm not seeking revenge.

33:11.197 --> 33:13.324
The important thing here is the business.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.953
No more fights. More income.

33:17.328 --> 33:18.871
Those who came before...

33:19.372 --> 33:20.415
...know it's best.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.625
That used to be how it was, and it worked.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.421
I've always said that.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.799
War harms the business.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.931
We're not interested in the federation.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.434
We're associates of Raciel.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.896
If the Gulf isn't in,
neither are we.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.983
We're fine the way we are, too.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.112
OK.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.574
Then I'll fuck the Avendaños by myself.

33:55.658 --> 33:59.287
Once I get rid of that nuisance,
for free, I might add...

33:59.620 --> 34:02.331
...I'll ask you if you want to join
the federation.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.710
You don't even have to ask,
Chapo.

34:05.793 --> 34:09.130
If you take care of the Avendaños,
we'll all join.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.106
Joaquín.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.400
Gentlemen.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.486
The DEA got in touch.

34:31.569 --> 34:33.780
They're interested in your offer
about the Avendaños.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.908
-What about the extradition?
-They're willing to negotiate.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.660
Sir... It may be a trap.

34:40.578 --> 34:42.455
They're all after you.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.833
Think of the weight off your back,
if we close a deal with the DEA.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.045
I think the same, the risk is too high.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.005
It's worth it.

34:54.258 --> 34:57.303
MEXICO CITY
MEXICO

35:40.596 --> 35:42.181
Where's your brother?

35:46.102 --> 35:47.937
I'm dealing with the negotiations.

36:38.779 --> 36:42.450
ALMOLOYA PENITENTIARY
MEXICO

37:40.007 --> 37:41.384
Give me the phone.

37:57.191 --> 37:58.442
Mom...

38:00.528 --> 38:02.113
...I want you to hear it from me.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.409
The police captured Pollo.

38:07.451 --> 38:09.704
Calm down, nothing will happen to him.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.831
I'll fix that.

38:26.387 --> 38:29.849
<i>Today,</i>
<i>after great investigative efforts,</i>

38:30.349 --> 38:34.186
Arturo Guzmán, AKA "El Pollo,"
has been captured.

38:34.270 --> 38:38.274
Brother of Joaquín AKA "El Chapo" Guzmán,

38:38.691 --> 38:41.235
<i>this action significantly fractures</i>

38:41.569 --> 38:44.572
<i>one of the most important drug cartels</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

38:44.780 --> 38:47.616
<i>It is believed that</i>
<i>Joaquín Guzmán Loera's capture</i>

38:48.159 --> 38:49.827
<i>will occur within two to six weeks.</i>

38:49.910 --> 38:52.455
They won't stop until he's captured.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.795
What do you want?

39:05.384 --> 39:08.846
Tell Joaquín I have a proposal
he'd like to hear.

40:06.862 --> 40:09.740
-What do you propose?
-A trade.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.785
You get me the Avendaños.

40:14.703 --> 40:17.540
With that, I'll get my position
in the government back.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.209
And I'll make them stop chasing you.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.255
They have to stop chasing me,
and release my brother.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.345
Your brother's release won't be possible.

40:33.055 --> 40:36.016
It's the most important action
the government has done after your escape.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.062
They won't release him.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.159
They're after you, Joaquín.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.037
If we work together,

40:57.746 --> 40:59.331
you'll be a free man.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.505
Otherwise, you'll end up sharing
a cell with your brother.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.971
I'll give you the Avendaños.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.606
Only one alive.

41:24.690 --> 41:26.567
The other one has a debt to pay.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.446
<i>-It's done.</i>
<i>-Kill them.</i>

41:32.364 --> 41:33.908
Kill them all.
