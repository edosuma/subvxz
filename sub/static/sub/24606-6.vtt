19:58.000 --> 20:01.550
Hell, who do you think sold me this boat?

20:01.640 --> 20:03.199
Anything else you want to know?

20:03.280 --> 20:05.954
Life story? Hopes and dreams?

20:06.040 --> 20:08.077
The color of my last bowel movement?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.833
(CHUCKLES)

20:14.240 --> 20:15.674
You been to all these places?

20:15.760 --> 20:18.320
(SCOFFS)

20:18.400 --> 20:19.913
Don't blame you.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.391
If I was married to Bajie,
I'd sail as far away as I could.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.798
We met when I was second mate
on a pirate barge.

20:33.880 --> 20:35.553
Doing fuel raids.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.438
Bajie was a pirate?

20:37.520 --> 20:39.875
Damn good one, too.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.473
He knew jack about boats,

20:41.560 --> 20:44.871
but within a week,
he'd convinced the entire crew

20:44.960 --> 20:48.271
that the Captain had dementia,
and staged a coup.

20:48.360 --> 20:52.069
He was brilliant, and devious,

20:52.160 --> 20:55.676
and I wanted to
jump him immediately.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.393
We started running scams
up and down the river,

21:01.480 --> 21:04.871
saving our spoils to buy a real boat.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.520
We were gonna get out of the Badlands.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.398
Sail the world together.

21:11.200 --> 21:14.795
-What happened?
-What do you think?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.110
Bajie happened.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.478
He got a lead on Azra
from some drunk in a dive bar,

21:21.560 --> 21:23.312
and poof!

21:23.400 --> 21:26.597
He took all our money,
left me a note.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.791
A goddamn note.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.434
And I've been living
hand-to-mouth ever since.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.033
I'm sorry.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.236
Save your pity.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.715
(SMACKS LIPS) You're going to need it.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.394
Running with that shit bird?

21:45.480 --> 21:47.710
You're bound for ruin.

21:50.560 --> 21:53.951
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

22:00.360 --> 22:02.920
| wasn't sure I'd see you again.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.469
Yes, you were. You knew |I'd come.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.392
-Are you okay?
-Stop.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.596
You don't get to be nice.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.031
You saved my life, and I appreciate it,
but it doesn't change anything.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.391
So, then what are we doing out here,
Tilda? We measuring swords?

22:16.520 --> 22:18.796
| came to offer a truce.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.236
Chau's Clippers took a bunch of refugees.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.671
I'm not sitting on the sidelines anymore.
| want to help you take her down.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.798
You always were
a bleeding heart.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.872
-Unfortunately, during times of war...
-I'm not here for a lecture.

22:32.960 --> 22:37.193
-Do you want my help or not?
-Of course, I do.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.915
Just so we're clear,
I'll fight by your side.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.913
But I'm not your Regent,
and I am not your daughter.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.470
We fight as allies, or as enemies.
Your choice.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.313
Allies it is.

Where am I?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.631
What are you doing to me?

23:23.720 --> 23:26.553
The needles are a necessary
precaution, I'm afraid.

23:26.640 --> 23:28.517
Your Gift makes you dangerous.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.954
(GRUNTS)

23:30.040 --> 23:33.032
| can help ease your suffering,
if you cooperate.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.711
Tell me. How does Pilgrim
control your Gift?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.393
| saw him turn it off.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.400
You think you know about the Gift?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.510
About us?

23:48.600 --> 23:51.240
You know nothing.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.799
Pilgrim was chosen.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.280
Really? By whom?

23:57.360 --> 23:58.509
By Azra.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.195
I've seen him level cities with his gaze.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.989
Decimate armies with
only his words for weapons.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.594
Words, yes, and two Dark Ones.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.916
| wonder what will happen
when you're gone.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.072
What will he do without
his precious attack dogs?

24:15.160 --> 24:18.790
He has already found another.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.995
It's a boy, isn't it?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.391
His name is M.K.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.118
He will betray Pilgrim.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.191
Even kill him, if he gets the chance.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.837
The boy's loyalty is impressive.
But he's getting worse.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.355
And we're getting nowhere.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.477
| take it my Regent
has a suggestion.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.029
Cut off his head
and send it to Pilgrim.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.714
Punishment for
raiding the camp.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.876
Or we could use the
boy's devotion as a weapon,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.678
to weaken Pilgrim.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.478
The man's a zealot.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.119
We need to send a clear message.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.670
I'm not interested in intimidation.
| want answers.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.831
Prepare the boy for travel.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.751
Whiskey for your thoughts?

25:24.200 --> 25:26.794
Just thinking how pleasant it was
not seeing your face,

25:26.920 --> 25:30.834
-and then you went and ruined it.
-(LAUGHING)

25:31.840 --> 25:33.399

25:36.680 --> 25:38.353
Okay.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.956
| just want to say, thank you.

25:42.040 --> 25:45.078
For giving Sunny and the kid a chance.
All right?

25:46.320 --> 25:48.231
| know you've got
a million reasons to hate me.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.630
But that little boy deserves a shot.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.711
| just wanna say,
thank you for giving him one.

25:54.360 --> 25:59.230
All right, all right. One drink,
if it puts a cork in your pie hole.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.958
BAJIE:
Best years of our lives, eh, Lil?

26:04.080 --> 26:05.798
-Well, two years, anyway.
-(LILY LAUGHS)

26:05.880 --> 26:08.269

Hey!

26:20.280 --> 26:21.953
You kept Lucky Linda?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.360
Mmm.

26:24.600 --> 26:29.071
Yeah, I wanted a souvenir of the man
who stole my money and my heart.

26:29.160 --> 26:31.071
(CHUCKLES)

26:34.560 --> 26:35.914

26:36.960 --> 26:39.031
-You've got some nerve!
-Ow.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.033
-What? I just thought...
-You don't think, Bajie.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.719
That's your problem.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.589
Come back into my life with
your crappy bottle of hooch

26:47.680 --> 26:51.560
and your old memories, thinking
we can just pick up where we left off.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.429
Take your shitty lighter and get out.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.399
It's just as cheap
and unreliable as you are.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.793
(DISTANT SCREAMING)

29:12.040 --> 29:14.111
Remember, M.K.'s there by choice.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.116
Don't do anything foolish.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.992
-Where is my boy?
-Where are my refugees?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.832
CRESSIDA: That's an odd way to put it.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.958
People displaced by your war

29:31.920 --> 29:33.638
PILGRIM:
We offer sanctuary, nothing more.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.677
They may leave if they wish.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.436

29:39.520 --> 29:41.670
| leave you to chase your invisible city

29:41.800 --> 29:44.189
and dig your holes in the ground,
and you stay out of my war.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.998
Where is Castor?

29:46.080 --> 29:48.469
| won't ask again.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.877
(LABORED BREATHING)

30:19.360 --> 30:23.035
We treated him as best we could,
but his condition is worsening.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.432
And why would you do me
this kindness, I wonder.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.830
Because a father should
say goodbye to his son.

30:29.920 --> 30:33.151
-And because I'm not your enemy.
-You have said this once before.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.950
Maybe this time, you'll believe me.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.237
Anyone who would seek power
for its own sake is my enemy.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.993
Are you not such a person?

30:42.080 --> 30:44.674
Would you humble yourself
before me?

30:44.760 --> 30:46.717
| seek peace.

30:46.800 --> 30:50.395
An end to suffering in the Badlands.
Nothing more.

30:52.120 --> 30:54.555
As for humbling myself before you,

30:54.640 --> 30:56.597
or any man,

30:56.680 --> 30:58.671
I'll let you guess how likely that is.

31:19.600 --> 31:22.558
Thank you for returning my son.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.678
The Gift our children possess...

31:26.960 --> 31:28.871

31:30.680 --> 31:32.512
Who told you that?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.311
Tell me...

31:37.560 --> 31:40.029
do you long to have it back again?

31:52.960 --> 31:54.917
What the hell was that?

31:55.000 --> 31:57.879
Now, you gave up our only leverage for
a handshake and a hollow promise.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.917
No, I bought us time.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.832
To finish Chau.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.718
We're gonna need her army
to defeat the Dark Ones.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.394
But what if Pilgrim strikes first?
Before we're ready.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.199
They see me as a believer
ready to be converted,

32:09.320 --> 32:11.277
not an enemy to be conquered.

You gave me no choice.

How could you do this to me?

36:47.320 --> 36:48.754
Oh, it was easy.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.956
