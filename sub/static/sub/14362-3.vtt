<i>Church--</i>

00:06.276 --> 00:07.603
<i>sometimes</i>
<i>you go for fellowship,</i>

00:07.752 --> 00:10.041
<i>sometimes you go</i>
<i>for spiritual nourishment,</i>

00:10.223 --> 00:12.772
<i>and sometimes you go 'cause</i>
<i>they loaned you the church van,</i>

00:12.899 --> 00:14.116
<i>which you kept way too long</i>

00:14.234 --> 00:15.513
<i>'cause your daughter got</i>
<i>her driver's license,</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:17.337
<i>and it was nice</i>
<i>to have an extra car.</i>

00:17.921 --> 00:22.024
Verse 8 says,
"charity never faileth."

00:22.226 --> 00:23.553
Everyone here today

00:23.657 --> 00:26.523
has been touched
by the church's generosity--

00:26.672 --> 00:29.034
some more than others.

00:29.169 --> 00:32.807
What precedes charity
is faith and hope.

00:32.956 --> 00:36.342
You have faith
in the object of your charity,

00:36.464 --> 00:41.113
and you hope that <i>someday,</i>
<i>it will be returned to you.</i>

00:41.745 --> 00:44.359
Crap.
They want the van back.

00:45.484 --> 00:47.091
Thank you. Hey.
Nice to see you.

00:47.196 --> 00:48.435
Have a great week.

00:55.192 --> 00:56.934
Hey!

00:57.031 --> 00:58.163
Reverend Hayver.

00:58.251 --> 00:59.939
Oh, great sermon today.

01:00.038 --> 01:02.613
It was entertaining,
but it also made you think.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.370
We want the van back, Frankie.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.492
Yeah, I know we've had it
for a long time,

01:06.617 --> 01:09.011
but you know how those
insurance companies are.

01:09.101 --> 01:10.304
I mean, they're happy
to take your money,

01:10.398 --> 01:12.129
but once you need
something fixed, good luck.

01:12.234 --> 01:13.978
Am I right?

01:14.168 --> 01:15.471
We know you got your car back.

01:15.926 --> 01:17.757
We drove by your house
last night.

01:17.907 --> 01:21.227
Wow.
Spying on people's houses.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.587
Doesn't seem
very Jesus-ey.

01:23.694 --> 01:26.698
The van is supposed to be used
to help people in need.

01:26.809 --> 01:29.880
Oh, we help people in need.
Right, guys?

01:29.975 --> 01:30.521
- Totally!
- Sure.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.115
Not that I recall.

01:32.899 --> 01:35.487
Just last week, I drove
the Senior Ladies' prayer group

01:35.575 --> 01:36.719
to the beauty parlor.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.832
Yes, and then you made them
sit in the van

01:38.931 --> 01:40.739
while you went shoe shopping.

01:40.992 --> 01:42.498
Who told you that?
Berta?

01:42.608 --> 01:44.205
You know she cheats at bingo.

01:44.387 --> 01:46.062
I need the keys, Frankie.

01:46.182 --> 01:47.673
We hope we can do this
peacefully.

01:51.651 --> 01:52.706
Fine.

01:54.071 --> 01:55.516
Can we at least get our stuff?

01:55.600 --> 01:57.446
I think we might have left
a few things in there.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.455
Did our church
just break up with us?

02:04.673 --> 02:05.658
At least they had the decency

02:05.755 --> 02:07.057
to do it
during football season.

02:07.201 --> 02:08.370
Ugh.
Can you believe that guy?

02:08.485 --> 02:10.470
"Feel free to explore
other religions."

02:10.556 --> 02:12.566
I wouldn't mind checking out
the Christian Scientists.

02:12.671 --> 02:14.330
I hear they have
a very nice reading room.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.096
I don't know why
you guys are complaining.

02:16.194 --> 02:18.376
I'm the one who doesn't
have a car anymore.

02:18.547 --> 02:20.353
I can't go back
to riding the bus.

02:20.470 --> 02:21.968
Do you realize
how big of a dork I'll be

02:22.081 --> 02:23.793
if I get back on that bus?

02:26.292 --> 02:28.627
I miss Axl.

02:30.767 --> 02:32.893
There you are--
finally!

02:33.052 --> 02:35.429
Axl, what's going on?
Why aren't you at college?

02:35.535 --> 02:37.219
I have the world's
worst roommate.

02:37.352 --> 02:38.001
I'm not kidding.

02:38.096 --> 02:40.115
The guy is a total pig.
He leaves his crap everywhere.

02:40.347 --> 02:41.470
Really?

02:41.561 --> 02:42.620
And he farts constantly,

02:42.715 --> 02:44.503
even though he's like
two feet from my head!

02:44.630 --> 02:45.373
Really?

02:45.468 --> 02:46.730
It's impossible
rooming with the guy!

02:46.821 --> 02:48.200
He acts like
I don't even exist.

02:48.297 --> 02:49.507
Really?

02:49.688 --> 02:50.953
Does he eat all your food?

02:51.046 --> 02:52.010
Yes.

02:52.218 --> 02:55.053
Hmm. What is like living
with someone like that?

02:55.234 --> 02:56.129
Mm.

02:56.339 --> 02:57.807
I could tell you some stories.

02:58.903 --> 03:00.245
Anyway, I'm gonna need you guys

03:00.351 --> 03:01.495
to kick in
an extra 50 bucks a month

03:01.607 --> 03:02.754
so I can move
into a single dorm--

03:02.835 --> 03:05.822
$60 gets me a pond view...
just saying.

03:06.023 --> 03:07.504
Great.

03:07.624 --> 03:08.477
I'll just call the bank

03:08.593 --> 03:11.413
and have them release some money
from your discretionary fund.

03:11.527 --> 03:12.499
Awesome.

03:12.590 --> 03:13.912
Now, if you can just scoot
three feet to your right,

03:13.992 --> 03:15.687
this will have been
the perfect conversation.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.484
Axl, we're not giving you
any money.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.129
It's only 50 extra bucks
a month!

03:19.242 --> 03:22.703
Axl, your dad's wearing a belt
he found on a park bench.

03:22.812 --> 03:24.331
We're not giving you
any more money.

03:24.418 --> 03:25.525
Oh, come on!

03:25.676 --> 03:28.597
We have all worked so hard
to get me to where I am.

03:28.702 --> 03:30.433
Now is not the time to give up!

03:30.534 --> 03:32.460
Actually, we're very comfortable
giving up.

03:32.652 --> 03:34.656
So that's it?
You're just gonna cry poverty?

03:34.807 --> 03:37.631
It's not like you guys are doing
everything you could do.

03:37.734 --> 03:39.720
Mom, you can't possibly say
you're working to capacity.

03:39.825 --> 03:41.551
I mean, you're home now,
aren't you?

03:41.640 --> 03:43.042
And, dad, you could pick up
a few extra night shifts.

03:43.136 --> 03:45.230
I mean, what are you rushing
home to, anyway?

03:45.339 --> 03:47.031
Sorry, pal.
You're a big boy now.

03:47.156 --> 03:49.171
You got to start
figuring out things on your own.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.036
Axl, look.

03:50.148 --> 03:51.745
Why don't you just talk
to your roommate,

03:51.862 --> 03:52.859
be diplomatic?

03:52.992 --> 03:55.911
You can be very persuasive
and charming when you want to.

03:56.009 --> 03:58.431
I know. I'm amazing.
What's your point?

03:58.564 --> 04:01.641
Why are we still talking
about this?

04:01.767 --> 04:03.252
We have bigger problems here.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.983
We don't have
the church van anymore.

04:05.113 --> 04:07.378
Do you realize
how big of a dork I will be

04:07.501 --> 04:09.497
if I get back on that bus?

04:10.182 --> 04:12.079
Sue, you don't need a bus
to be a dork.

04:12.190 --> 04:13.236
Your face, clothes,
and personality

04:13.334 --> 04:14.598
will do the job for you.

04:14.751 --> 04:15.919
There it is.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.502
Okay.

04:21.607 --> 04:22.633
I think I figured out a system

04:22.756 --> 04:24.388
for the three of us
to share two cars.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.139
- Sue.
- Just hear me out.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.329
I promise you guys won't
be inconvenienced at all.

04:29.462 --> 04:31.236
You're already wrong,
but go ahead.

04:31.326 --> 04:32.391
All righty.

04:32.994 --> 04:35.016
Dad, you're the blue line,
mom, you're the red line,

04:35.099 --> 04:36.150
and I'm the green car keys.

04:36.275 --> 04:37.970
On Monday,
I'll drive mom to work,

04:38.070 --> 04:39.953
and dad will pick her up
on his way home from the quarry.

04:40.065 --> 04:42.207
Then,
after wrestlerette practice,

04:42.302 --> 04:43.644
I'll grab Brick
from the library,

04:43.801 --> 04:45.788
and dad will drop mom
at the frugal hoosier

04:45.881 --> 04:47.766
on his way
to his softball game.

04:47.901 --> 04:49.928
Now, Tuesday might get
a little complicated.

04:51.965 --> 04:53.627
It involves
four different drop-offs,

04:53.715 --> 04:56.656
and Brick would have to drive,
but only for one block.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.246
Sue... it's not gonna happen.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.097
You're just gonna have to
suck it up and take the bus.

05:00.193 --> 05:01.187
But that's not fair!

05:01.350 --> 05:03.253
Axl got his own car
in high school!

05:03.376 --> 05:04.516
Yeah, and he held two jobs

05:04.664 --> 05:06.598
to pay for the gas
and insurance.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.296
Oh, my God!

05:09.982 --> 05:12.770
I'm 16! I can get a job!

05:12.895 --> 05:15.304
<i>I</i> can work! I'm so lucky!

05:15.523 --> 05:18.020
Yeah, your dad and I pinch
ourselves every day.

05:18.132 --> 05:19.141
Mom, can you drop me off

05:19.269 --> 05:21.274
at the mall this week
after school to job hunt?

05:21.441 --> 05:22.769
Dad could pick me up.

05:22.874 --> 05:24.266
Oh! We'll use
Friday's schedule!

05:24.420 --> 05:25.407
Hold on.
Let me show you.

05:25.527 --> 05:26.849
Uh, it's okay, Sue.

05:26.966 --> 05:28.395
We'll figure something out.

05:29.227 --> 05:30.826
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

05:30.929 --> 05:33.281
I'm so excited,
I'm gonna go call Carly.

05:34.991 --> 05:37.028
What day can you pick her up
from the mall?

05:37.153 --> 05:39.625
Oh, I said <i>we'll figure
something out-- I meant you.</i>

05:39.821 --> 05:42.092
What is it with kids
always wanting stuff?

05:42.272 --> 05:44.132
Brick's the only one
who's not bugging us lately.

05:44.249 --> 05:45.229
I know, right?

05:45.342 --> 05:46.644
I mean,
his transition to middle school

05:46.755 --> 05:48.639
has been
oddly hassle-free.

05:48.751 --> 05:49.647
I thought for sure

05:49.756 --> 05:51.625
we'd have gotten
"the call" by now.

05:53.904 --> 05:55.105
Don't answer it.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.009
Hello?

05:59.268 --> 06:00.198
Uh-huh.

06:00.540 --> 06:01.595
Uh-huh.

06:02.115 --> 06:03.118
It's "the call."

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074

06:13.775 --> 06:15.693
So, Axl, in a desperate moment,

06:15.809 --> 06:17.831
<i>did something</i>
<i>he'd never done before--</i>

06:18.833 --> 06:20.647
<i>he took his parents' advice.</i>

06:22.643 --> 06:25.748
Whoa! Nice shot!

06:25.882 --> 06:27.023
You've got some mad skills.

06:27.279 --> 06:28.690
Hey.

06:28.929 --> 06:30.599
So, before you destroy
another civilization,

06:30.752 --> 06:32.419
I was thinking maybe we could,
uh, you know,

06:32.536 --> 06:34.886
chat a little.

06:35.059 --> 06:35.783
I mean, what's the use

06:35.894 --> 06:36.938
of getting
randomly assigned to a guy

06:37.035 --> 06:38.887
if you can't get to know him,
am I right?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.598
Okay.

06:41.725 --> 06:42.790
Oh!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.055
Here's an idea--
what do you say

06:44.168 --> 06:46.602
we, uh, clean this place up
a little, hmm?

06:46.803 --> 06:47.872
I'll get it started.

06:48.260 --> 06:49.400
Okay.

06:49.846 --> 06:53.467
Huh. Well, I believe
these bad boys are yours.

06:54.717 --> 06:55.970
So, why don't I just start
a pile for you?

06:56.126 --> 06:57.280
There we go.

06:57.415 --> 06:58.276
Uh, hey!

06:58.411 --> 07:00.046
You done with this
old dental floss, or...

07:00.647 --> 07:01.971
Yuck. Yeah.

07:04.121 --> 07:05.083
Ew.

07:06.368 --> 07:07.387
On second thought...

07:08.030 --> 07:09.510
It's getting pretty late.

07:10.744 --> 07:12.226
I think I'm gonna catch
some Z's.

07:12.347 --> 07:14.612
Whoo!

07:14.931 --> 07:15.882
Hey.

07:16.014 --> 07:18.220
You seen
my pillow anywhere, or...

07:19.146 --> 07:20.003
Oh.

07:20.569 --> 07:22.383
You're sitting on it.

07:23.699 --> 07:26.127
Uh... if I could just...

07:27.147 --> 07:28.901
That's cool.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.959
I'll just ball up some of these
old, dirty clothes instead.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.938
Thank you
for inviting us in today.

07:49.168 --> 07:50.460
I didn't invite you.

07:50.585 --> 07:51.880
This isn't some cocktail party

07:51.985 --> 07:53.863
at your neighbor's
fancy rec room.

07:54.072 --> 07:57.295
You're here
because we have an issue.

07:57.505 --> 07:59.295
Yeah, about that.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.792
We were actually surprised
to get your call.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.031
Things have been going so well.

08:03.134 --> 08:04.546
Yeah, Brick's been
really happy this year.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.041
Oh, has Brick been happy?

08:06.152 --> 08:06.825
Oh, that's great.

08:06.929 --> 08:08.737
Why don't you take
a guess why, hmm?

08:09.086 --> 08:10.169
Time's up!

08:10.291 --> 08:11.010
It's because

08:11.103 --> 08:13.561
he hasn't been attending
any of his classes.

08:13.843 --> 08:14.801
- That's crazy.
- What?

08:14.974 --> 08:16.613
All of his teachers
have reported

08:16.710 --> 08:18.032
that he's not showing up.

08:18.136 --> 08:20.888
But we've been dropping him off
at school every morning.

08:20.990 --> 08:22.071
Where is he going?!

08:22.359 --> 08:23.432
I don't know.

08:23.554 --> 08:25.820
I have 425 kids to worry about.

08:25.979 --> 08:27.119
And you have how many?

08:27.250 --> 08:28.268
Hmm. Let me check.

08:28.391 --> 08:29.966
Oh, that's right-- one.

08:30.133 --> 08:33.760
So, why don't we go ahead
and make that your job, hmm?

08:33.994 --> 08:35.332
Actually, we have three kids,

08:35.441 --> 08:37.690
but Mike's really
in charge of the boys.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.054
Oh, sure--

08:39.162 --> 08:40.751
nobody wants the sixth graders.

08:40.917 --> 08:43.361
They're not cute and adorable
little elementary-school kids.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.672
They're ugly, hormonal,

08:44.784 --> 08:47.962
one-baby-tooth, one-grown-up-tooth
middle-school messes.

08:48.137 --> 08:50.712
And you parents just want
to dump them and run.

08:50.953 --> 08:53.470
We do not dump our kids.

08:53.624 --> 08:56.246
Trust us-- we've tried.
They keep coming back.

08:56.689 --> 08:57.747
Mm. I'm sorry.

08:57.846 --> 08:59.144
Did you think
we're still talking?

08:59.424 --> 09:00.325
We're not.

09:04.442 --> 09:05.539
Brick!

09:05.648 --> 09:06.742
Kids are never around
when you want them

09:06.825 --> 09:08.309
and always around
when you don't.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.077
I am so glad you guys are here.

09:10.286 --> 09:12.968
Brad and I canvassed the mall
looking for job applications,

09:13.161 --> 09:15.667
and I really need help
narrowing down my choices.

09:15.825 --> 09:19.954
Okay, Tacos Olé
has super-cool uniforms,

09:20.111 --> 09:23.614
but the Yamamoto Beef Bowl
smells amazing!

09:23.723 --> 09:25.261
This is so hard!

09:25.364 --> 09:27.138
It's just like Sophie's choice.

09:27.269 --> 09:29.271
My friend Sophie is getting
a puppy for her birthday,

09:29.376 --> 09:31.263
and she can't decide
between a Corgi and a Beagle.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.004
You know, Sue,

09:32.104 --> 09:33.727
there's also a movie
called "Sophie's Choice."

09:33.840 --> 09:35.900
Oh, really?!
Was it about dogs?

09:36.046 --> 09:36.976
Was it sad?

09:37.089 --> 09:38.792
Oh, wait--
don't spoil it for me.

09:39.803 --> 09:41.764
I'm gonna go start filling out
these job applications.

09:41.925 --> 09:43.855
And, you know, a lot of these
don't have space

09:43.954 --> 09:45.266
for a personal essay.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.751
I guess I'll just attach my own.

09:49.061 --> 09:51.395
Well,
look what the cat dragged in.

09:51.566 --> 09:53.111
Hey, Brick.
How was school?

09:53.262 --> 09:55.147
- Great.
- I bet.

09:55.347 --> 09:57.857
I'd like school, too,
if I never had to go to class.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.662
We got a call
from your Principal.

10:00.871 --> 10:03.392
You haven't been going
to any classes?

10:03.488 --> 10:04.541
Come on, Brick.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.436
Lick all the windshields
you want, but go to class.

10:07.801 --> 10:09.006
What are you talking about?

10:09.343 --> 10:10.804
Uh... look,
here's the deal--

10:10.913 --> 10:12.592
you can be quirky
<i>or</i> irresponsible,

10:12.692 --> 10:13.996
but you got to pick one.

10:14.751 --> 10:16.363
But I <i>have</i> been going to class.

10:16.622 --> 10:17.671
Are you lying?

10:17.762 --> 10:18.443
No.

10:18.550 --> 10:19.335
Are you just in so deep

10:19.428 --> 10:21.174
you feel like you can't
get out of the lie?

10:21.315 --> 10:22.568
He's not doing his tell.

10:22.744 --> 10:24.421
Say, "I've been going
to class."

10:24.685 --> 10:26.188
I've been going to class.

10:26.299 --> 10:28.084
Say, "I like sports."

10:28.202 --> 10:29.436
I like sports.

10:29.535 --> 10:30.677
I'm lying.

10:31.158 --> 10:32.639
I swear I've been going
to classes.

10:32.772 --> 10:34.519
Look, here's all the homework
I've been doing.

10:34.836 --> 10:36.549
And here's my Spanish test.

10:37.647 --> 10:39.028
You got
an A-minus on this.

10:39.123 --> 10:40.439
It's one of my favorite
classes.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.130
Now, can I please
go do my homework?

10:42.254 --> 10:43.598
Or as Señor Frederick says,

10:43.728 --> 10:46.797
"¿puedo ir, por favor,
terminar mi tarea ahora?"

10:50.976 --> 10:51.886
I can't believe this.

10:51.993 --> 10:53.492
I cannot believe
that Principal had the nerve

10:53.599 --> 10:55.796
to call us in
and treat us like that!

10:55.907 --> 10:57.154
I told you
not to answer the phone.

10:57.293 --> 10:58.701
Enough is enough!

10:58.806 --> 11:00.817
That place is a big,
bungling bureaucracy,

11:00.925 --> 11:02.557
and somebody needs
to call them on it!

11:02.667 --> 11:03.750
We're going back in there.

11:03.892 --> 11:04.929
Aw, come on!

11:05.046 --> 11:06.211
We're not "go back in" people.

11:06.338 --> 11:09.012
We're "barely show up
in the first place" people.

11:09.122 --> 11:11.345
I'm serious, Mike.
I am sick of that school.

11:11.532 --> 11:12.946
They're falsely accusing Brick,

11:13.055 --> 11:14.483
they had no idea who Sue was,

11:14.582 --> 11:16.968
and God knows
what they did to Axl.

11:17.113 --> 11:18.518
They made us feel like
bad parents,

11:18.624 --> 11:20.243
and we are not bad parents.

11:20.488 --> 11:22.134
Should I describe myself
as loyal--

11:22.239 --> 11:23.950
Not now, Sue!

11:28.113 --> 11:29.789
You are not gonna believe this!

11:30.067 --> 11:31.515
I got an interview!

11:31.620 --> 11:32.640
- Hey!
- Hey!

11:32.793 --> 11:34.474
The Assistant Manager
at Spudsy Malone's

11:34.575 --> 11:35.991
wants to meet me in the mall
on the bench

11:36.091 --> 11:37.900
by the sunglasses kiosk
next to the plant.

11:38.033 --> 11:41.294
He said he wants to meet me
at 3:00 to 3:15,

11:41.389 --> 11:42.605
so I think it's pretty serious.

11:42.819 --> 11:44.188
No one cares about
your stupid interview

11:44.305 --> 11:45.727
at the stupid
potato place, Sue.

11:45.849 --> 11:47.470
Mom, Axl stole my cereal!

11:47.575 --> 11:49.134
Axl, give your sister
the cereal.

11:49.249 --> 11:49.972
Whatevs.

11:50.296 --> 11:51.225
- Mom!
- Mike.

11:51.348 --> 11:52.531
Axl.

11:55.432 --> 11:56.460
Don't take this the wrong way,

11:56.557 --> 11:58.396
but... what the hell
are you doing here?

11:58.574 --> 12:00.568
I couldn't spend another minute
with my nightmare of a roommate,

12:00.657 --> 12:02.895
so I drove home last night
and slept in my bed.

12:03.382 --> 12:05.840
I thought I saw a strange man
standing in my room.

12:05.961 --> 12:08.000
Axl, you can't just come home
anytime you want.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.574
And, Brick, in the future,

12:09.697 --> 12:11.346
if you see a strange man
in your room,

12:11.455 --> 12:13.214
you should probably
scream or run.

12:13.339 --> 12:14.138
Or both.

12:16.255 --> 12:19.048
So, I tried to use
your stupid advice,

12:19.171 --> 12:20.708
which, of course, didn't work,

12:20.817 --> 12:21.895
so I had no other options.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.862
I mean, eventually, I'll meet
a hot chick with a sweet room

12:24.968 --> 12:25.819
I can shack up with,

12:25.928 --> 12:29.170
but this guy is really
starting to affect my studies.

12:29.342 --> 12:30.877
I mean, don't you want me
to do good at school?

12:30.991 --> 12:33.167
Yeah, we want you
to do good <i>at</i> school.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.157
You're not sleeping
and showering here.

12:35.314 --> 12:37.636
Your hot water is up there,
your electricity's up there,

12:37.750 --> 12:38.929
your food's up there.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.902
Basically, everything's
up there except you.

12:41.130 --> 12:42.019
Oh, my God.

12:42.543 --> 12:43.761
I can't believe this!

12:44.314 --> 12:45.597
Unh!

12:46.073 --> 12:47.455
I thought you guys
would miss me!

12:47.774 --> 12:49.064
I'm your firstborn son!

12:49.405 --> 12:51.053
I thought when I came home,
there'd be a big parade,

12:51.205 --> 12:54.454
you'd throw your arms around me,
be thrilled that I'm back,

12:54.555 --> 12:55.432
but no!

12:55.563 --> 12:58.969
I come here for a little love
and support, and I get nothing!

12:59.068 --> 13:00.410
You guys are so selfish!

13:00.584 --> 13:01.499
Well, guess what--

13:01.725 --> 13:02.592
I'm out of here.

13:02.691 --> 13:05.467
So, take a good look,
'cause the Ax-Man is leaving!

13:13.138 --> 13:14.623
Can somebody get the door?

13:21.114 --> 13:22.360
Now slam it!

13:29.336 --> 13:30.600
<i>When most people</i>
<i>have a problem,</i>

13:30.718 --> 13:32.727
<i>they work diligently</i>
<i>to solve it...</i>

13:33.284 --> 13:34.882
<i>and then there's Axl.</i>

13:34.987 --> 13:36.043
It's so sad.

13:36.141 --> 13:37.531
My roommate's financial aid
fell through,

13:37.633 --> 13:39.078
so she had to move back home.

13:39.250 --> 13:40.347
Anyway, now I've got

13:40.433 --> 13:42.670
this huge dorm room
all to myself.

13:43.552 --> 13:44.455
Hi, there.

13:45.103 --> 13:46.620
Axl Heck.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.285
Okay, I think I finally have
the e-mail

13:52.381 --> 13:53.660
I'm gonna send
to the Principal.

13:53.803 --> 13:56.217
I thought you finally had it
last night at 11:00...

13:56.332 --> 13:57.823
and 1:00 and 2:30.

13:57.922 --> 13:58.783
How's this sound?

13:58.911 --> 14:00.855
"Dear Principal Barker,
my husband and I

14:00.946 --> 14:02.449
would like
the opportunity to meet with you

14:02.541 --> 14:04.082
at your earliest convenience."

14:04.168 --> 14:05.898
Agh. Why do we have to go
back in there?

14:06.052 --> 14:07.042
Can't you just call her?

14:07.178 --> 14:08.078
Think about it, Mike.

14:08.199 --> 14:09.280
How many times do we get
the chance

14:09.375 --> 14:12.047
to go to a school meeting
where we're actually right?

14:12.186 --> 14:12.772
Trust me.

14:12.897 --> 14:14.236
This is something we're
gonna want to do in person.

14:14.385 --> 14:16.868
"I think you'll be very interested
in what we have to say."

14:16.981 --> 14:18.676
Notice I'm not telling her
what we're mad about.

14:18.781 --> 14:20.787
I don't want to give her a
chance to load up her argument.

14:20.971 --> 14:24.209
"We know you have 425 students
to deal with,

14:24.341 --> 14:26.717
but we hope you have time
to deal with our one."

14:26.840 --> 14:28.888
See? I threw her own words
back in her face.

14:29.017 --> 14:30.094
Ba-bam!

14:30.837 --> 14:32.115
Why are you so angry?

14:32.280 --> 14:33.849
So many reasons.

14:35.565 --> 14:37.486
- Dad, guess what!
- Good, honey.

14:37.934 --> 14:41.394
Say hello to the new Potato Girl
at Spudsy Malone's!

14:41.506 --> 14:42.876
Oh, congratulations!

14:42.983 --> 14:44.124
So the interview went well.

14:44.247 --> 14:46.137
It was amazing!

14:46.287 --> 14:48.955
The manager offered me the job
so quickly.

14:49.084 --> 14:50.491
He was super decisive.

14:50.655 --> 14:53.940
You don't normally see that kind
of maturity in a 14-year-old.

14:54.095 --> 14:55.419
He was really impressed.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.218
At one point,
I was reading from my essay,

14:57.357 --> 15:00.261
and he even said,
"I don't need to hear any more."

15:00.465 --> 15:01.918
Wow.

15:02.097 --> 15:04.803
And check out this awesome pin.

15:05.009 --> 15:07.138
"Try our new
tuna and cheese potato.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.027
I love it!"

15:09.180 --> 15:13.258
And they even gave me a free one
to take home.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.627
I'm so excited.

15:18.066 --> 15:19.148
Oh.

15:19.271 --> 15:20.507
Must've been a bad bite.

15:23.127 --> 15:23.876
Ugh.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.881
That was even worse
than the first one.

15:28.185 --> 15:29.923
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

15:30.018 --> 15:31.786
This is not happening!

15:31.887 --> 15:33.638
- Honey, what's the problem?
- The problem is,

15:33.738 --> 15:35.117
I am gonna be wearing a pin
that says,

15:35.209 --> 15:36.591
"Try our new
tuna and cheese potato.

15:36.724 --> 15:37.626
I love it!"

15:37.722 --> 15:39.722
And I clearly do not love it.

15:39.849 --> 15:41.538
Well, Sue, it's just a job.

15:41.638 --> 15:43.019
You don't have to like
what you do.

15:43.108 --> 15:45.629
It's-- it's like cleaning
people's teeth or parenting.

15:45.827 --> 15:48.084
All I know is
I am finally working

15:48.183 --> 15:49.805
at a fast-food stand
in the mall,

15:49.918 --> 15:50.871
which is awesome,

15:51.016 --> 15:54.310
but now my dream
is turning into a nightmare!

15:54.419 --> 15:56.223
I won't be selling
delicious Idaho potatoes

15:56.330 --> 15:58.569
with your choice
of 34 different toppings.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.869
I'll be selling lies!

16:01.679 --> 16:03.485
Sue, come on.

16:05.773 --> 16:06.567
Don't look at me.

16:06.656 --> 16:07.810
I'm in charge of the boys.

16:19.559 --> 16:21.851
<i>So, Axl found</i>
<i>the perfect girl...</i>

16:22.166 --> 16:23.118
Hey, buddy.

16:23.528 --> 16:24.890
This is Beth.

16:25.113 --> 16:27.027
<i>- ...for Kenny.</i>
<i>- She's a girl</i>

16:27.131 --> 16:29.413
with a big, empty dorm room.

16:32.113 --> 16:34.892
She's also on level five
of "World Of Warcraft."

16:43.677 --> 16:45.616
<i>So, Axl was on the way</i>
<i>to solving his problem,</i>

16:45.823 --> 16:47.007
<i>but Sue--</i>

16:47.106 --> 16:49.303
<i>well, she was part</i>
<i>of the workforce now,</i>

16:49.379 --> 16:50.883
<i>so she just had to suck it up</i>

16:50.970 --> 16:52.778
<i>and do the job</i>
<i>they were payin' her for.</i>

16:52.917 --> 16:55.320
Have you tried our new
tuna and cheese potato?

16:55.516 --> 16:58.355
Because I have,
and I really, really,

16:58.480 --> 17:00.167
really...

17:00.468 --> 17:01.572
Have you tried

17:01.672 --> 17:03.712
our new tuna and cheese potato?

17:03.864 --> 17:05.111
I'm sorry.

17:05.252 --> 17:06.688
I...

17:08.622 --> 17:10.714
I really, really, really...

17:11.141 --> 17:12.266
Love it!

17:12.739 --> 17:14.510
I don't love it.

17:14.597 --> 17:15.669
I love it!

17:15.786 --> 17:18.795
It's horrible!

17:26.309 --> 17:27.628
I got to go.

17:28.935 --> 17:30.103
Please. Have a seat.

17:30.207 --> 17:31.137
Thank you.

17:37.262 --> 17:39.401
My husband and I
would just like to say,

17:39.538 --> 17:41.478
the next time you accuse
a student of something,

17:41.665 --> 17:43.818
you might want to get
your facts straight first.

17:44.414 --> 17:46.169
Is there a problem?

17:46.298 --> 17:47.988
Yes, there is a problem.

17:48.194 --> 17:50.217
You made us doubt our son.

17:50.326 --> 17:51.871
Because of your accusations,

17:52.015 --> 17:53.866
we broke that sacred bond
of trust

17:53.973 --> 17:55.573
that we hold so dear.

17:55.679 --> 17:57.680
The fact is,
Brick <i>has</i> been going to class.

17:57.788 --> 17:58.683
We've seen his homework.

17:58.805 --> 18:02.137
He even got an "A"-minus
on his Spanish test.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.718
Go ahead, Brick.
Hit her with some Spanish.

18:03.830 --> 18:04.984
<i>Me llamo</i> Brick.

18:05.077 --> 18:06.513
- What does that mean?
- My name is Brick.

18:06.629 --> 18:08.032
Boom.
His name is Brick.

18:08.364 --> 18:09.505
The bottom line is,

18:09.633 --> 18:11.013
you called us in here
and made us feel

18:11.114 --> 18:13.682
crappy about ourselves,
and that's wrong.

18:13.787 --> 18:14.870
We are good parents,

18:14.957 --> 18:16.665
and we know what's going on
with our son.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.933
So, rather than judging us,
you might want to spend

18:20.013 --> 18:21.766
a little time
looking at yourself

18:21.883 --> 18:23.229
because, apparently,
you don't even know

18:23.334 --> 18:24.921
what's going on
with your own teachers

18:25.040 --> 18:26.460
in your own school.

18:27.824 --> 18:30.319
I'm very sorry,
but all of Brick's teachers

18:30.432 --> 18:32.256
said he hasn't
been attending classes--

18:32.445 --> 18:35.701
Ms. Henderson, Mrs. Kimball,
Mr. Purdy...

18:35.798 --> 18:37.490
Oh. Who are they?

18:38.226 --> 18:39.491
Your teachers.

18:40.317 --> 18:41.442
I don't think so.

18:41.544 --> 18:42.849
I don't know
any of those people.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.442
What?

18:44.558 --> 18:45.969
Oh, wait a minute.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.471
Those must have been the names
of the teachers

18:47.568 --> 18:48.905
I got on the first day.

18:49.059 --> 18:50.647
Yeah, I didn't go
to any of those classes.

18:50.817 --> 18:51.956
Sue said I didn't have to.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.375
Trust me, Brick.

18:53.496 --> 18:56.145
Middle school is so much better
than elementary school,

18:56.266 --> 18:57.698
'cause, like,
in elementary school,

18:57.813 --> 18:59.661
you have to stay
with the same teacher all day.

18:59.808 --> 19:02.224
But in middle school,
if you get bored with one class,

19:02.331 --> 19:03.225
it's not so bad

19:03.367 --> 19:04.747
because you get to switch
classes.

19:04.892 --> 19:06.332
Hmm.

19:07.009 --> 19:09.254
I really didn't mesh
with the Pre-Algebra teacher,

19:09.377 --> 19:10.648
so I switched to Geometry.

19:10.779 --> 19:12.324
I'm not a big fan
of US History,

19:12.440 --> 19:15.416
so I tried European History,
which wasn't great,

19:15.541 --> 19:17.361
but I got a seat by the window,
which I loved.

19:17.512 --> 19:19.932
I swapped Spanish 1
for Spanish 3,

19:20.061 --> 19:22.166
and my Biology teacher
was a bit dry,

19:22.271 --> 19:24.591
so I decided I'd give
Shop Class a whirl,

19:24.710 --> 19:26.128
which I'm very happy I did

19:26.250 --> 19:28.245
because I'm halfway
through building

19:28.361 --> 19:30.544
what I'm told is a bird house.

19:36.954 --> 19:39.304
Brick, that's not what Sue meant.

19:39.392 --> 19:41.742
She meant that
if you don't like a teacher,

19:41.917 --> 19:44.120
at least you get to go
to another one later,

19:44.233 --> 19:45.598
not in place of.

19:46.048 --> 19:48.219
Oh, that's very different...

19:49.083 --> 19:50.245
...but I'm assuming
I still get to keep

19:50.320 --> 19:51.695
my three lunch periods?

19:52.080 --> 19:55.107
Well, you have 425 other
students to take care of,

19:55.197 --> 19:57.000
so we'll just get this one
out of your hair.

19:57.085 --> 19:58.119
Uh, before you go,

19:58.211 --> 20:00.752
Brick has six weeks of homework
to make up for

20:00.944 --> 20:03.073
in five different classes.

20:03.478 --> 20:06.137
<i>Me llamo</i> Principal Barker.
Boom.

20:06.318 --> 20:08.012
Get out of my office.

20:08.364 --> 20:10.310
You're right.
I'm glad we did that in person.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.380
Oh, no.

20:13.684 --> 20:14.490
What?

20:14.606 --> 20:16.135
I left my purse
in the Principal's office.

20:16.214 --> 20:17.369
The car keys were in it.

20:18.324 --> 20:20.526
There's no way
we're going back in there now.

20:20.848 --> 20:22.558
<i>So, for the second time</i>
<i>in a week,</i>

20:23.132 --> 20:25.285
<i>we were slinking home in shame.</i>

20:25.406 --> 20:28.395
<i>Yep, we'd slinked about as low</i>
<i>as we could slunk.</i>

20:29.488 --> 20:30.847
♪ oh, the Lord is good to me ♪

20:30.940 --> 20:33.224
♪ and so I thank the Lord ♪

20:33.351 --> 20:36.035
♪ for giving me
the things I need ♪

20:36.142 --> 20:38.533
♪ the sun and the rain
and the apple seeds... ♪

20:44.106 --> 20:47.209
Can you guys please
take a break from that game?!

20:57.709 --> 20:58.466
But the bottom line is,

20:58.587 --> 21:00.774
I can't sell something
I don't believe in,

21:01.345 --> 21:03.353
even if it means
taking the bus again.

21:03.575 --> 21:07.367
Therefore, I am respectfully
tendering my resignation.

21:07.759 --> 21:08.896
The tuna and cheese potato

21:09.011 --> 21:10.921
was just the special
of the week.

21:11.194 --> 21:14.271
In three days, our featured spud
will be the Thai shrimp delight.

21:14.410 --> 21:15.929
Really?!

21:16.219 --> 21:17.989
Well, that sounds delicious.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.454
<i>Everybody goes through</i>
<i>rough patches.</i>

21:22.575 --> 21:23.983
<i>We're not the only ones.</i>

21:24.268 --> 21:26.297
<i>But no matter how bad</i>
<i>things get,</i>

21:26.649 --> 21:29.051
<i>you just got to hunker down</i>
<i>and ride it out,</i>

21:29.559 --> 21:32.406
<i>'cause as a wise</i>
<i>14-year-old manager once said,</i>

21:32.783 --> 21:35.872
<i>"In a few days,</i>
<i>a new potato will come along."</i>
