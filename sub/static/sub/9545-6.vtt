Excuse me.
It's 2:00.

The doctor's just running
a little late.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.926
Okay. No problem.

00:30.930 --> 00:33.421
How late is he running?
Did he say?
<i>Just a few minutes.</i>

00:33.500 --> 00:35.434
It won't be long.
All right.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.102
Listen, does he-
Does he know I'm here?

00:39.172 --> 00:41.367
Maybe I could just pop in
and tell him-

00:41.441 --> 00:44.604
Uh, l- I don't think that's
such a good idea, Mr. Monk.
No.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.713
Where's Natalie?
She's out.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.908
She's running some errands.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.417

01:01.628 --> 01:04.221
Adrian-you know, Monk.

01:04.297 --> 01:07.733
- Yes, Mr. Monk. I know.
- Doctor Kroger's running late.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.962
Then you'll have something
to talk about, won't you?

01:10.036 --> 01:12.630
Do you need me to come over?
I'm five minutes away.

01:12.705 --> 01:16.232
Where are you?
You know, I don't even know.
I'm at some coffee shop.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.504
Did you find that toothbrush?
Yes, sir.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.172
Had to go to about
five drugstores,
but I found it.

Yes, sir.
Thank God.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.690
What about Trudy's picture?
I just came from
the frame shop.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.094
I got that too.
How does it look?

01:38.164 --> 01:42.294
- You know, they did a really good job.
You can't even see that scratch.
- Excellent.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.393
She really was pretty.

01:44.471 --> 01:48.373
- Yes, she was.
- Are you sure you're okay?
Maybe I should just come over.

01:48.441 --> 01:52.969
No. No, no. You know what?
I'm okay. In fact, I'm gonna be fine.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.139
Okay.
Well, have a good session.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.740

were getting a little

03:35.982 --> 03:38.780
That's true.
I'm pretty excited.
Hmm.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.411
I have some news.
Really?

03:41.487 --> 03:46.322
As you know, yesterday was
Trudy's birthday. I went to the grave.

03:46.392 --> 03:50.556
Then I came home,
and I reread some of her poems.

03:51.564 --> 03:55.933
There was this one passage
that really got to me.

[Stammering]
L-I just kept rereading it.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.503

"The snows that burn away...

04:27.867 --> 04:30.495

04:30.570 --> 04:33.232
for a reason.

04:33.306 --> 04:36.002

I think she wants
me to let go.

04:40.713 --> 04:43.181
Wow.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.809
Yeah.

Wow.

04:45.885 --> 04:47.853
And then yesterday,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.286
the radio was playing a song,

04:51.557 --> 04:53.491
but it wasn't the radio.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.730

Every time I say "What do you think?"

Well, what do you think?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.128
[Chuckling]
I'm almost afraid to say it.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.874

be getting better.

06:15.942 --> 06:18.035
Adrian, reading the poem-

06:18.111 --> 06:21.911
the reaction you had to it-
it-it's what we call

06:23.316 --> 06:25.477

06:37.296 --> 06:39.662

06:41.200 --> 06:43.566

06:48.441 --> 06:50.409
Yes, it does.
Hmm.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.501
But what doesn't?

06:52.578 --> 06:56.446
Did you tell anybody about me?
Where's our waitress?
She just disappeared.

this is very important.

06:59.886 --> 07:03.117

else about me?
Who would I tell?

07:03.189 --> 07:05.817
Janice is gone.
She's all I had.

07:07.493 --> 07:10.155
I don't like this
cloak-and-dagger stuff, Trudy.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.527
Well, believe me.
It's for your own good.
And...

07:12.598 --> 07:14.532
remember I asked you
not to call me Trudy.

07:14.600 --> 07:19.094
Call me Lisa.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry. Lisa.

07:19.172 --> 07:22.539
I still don't understand
why you had to fake
your own death.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.406
I was protecting my family.

07:25.478 --> 07:29.505
I was writing an article
about an extremist group in the Bay Area,
and they were looking for me.

07:29.582 --> 07:32.278
They would have killed me
and my husband for sure
if they'd found me.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.377
The only way to stop 'em
was to pretend I was dead.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.015
Oh.
Here we go.
Tuna fish sandwich,

07:38.090 --> 07:40.991
and a coffee
and one cinnamon stick.

07:41.060 --> 07:44.029
Cinnamon stick?
Yeah, to sweeten it.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.996
It's a little trick
I picked up in Madrid.

07:46.065 --> 07:47.999
Oh, that's right.
You and Janice
went to Madrid.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.797
I have all the letters she wrote.
I kept everything.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.067
I know you did.
That's why I'm here, Zach.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.076
Hey, great sandwich.
They got little pieces
of celery in this.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.908
Do you want some?
No. I can't.
I'm allergic to fish.

08:00.980 --> 08:05.917
Oh, that's right.
I remember. I remember
everything... eventually.

08:05.985 --> 08:09.352
We need to talk, Zach,
about the key- the key
thatJanice left you.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.414
Do you have it?
Oh, I still can't
believe she's gone.

08:14.026 --> 08:18.395
Yeah, I know. I know it hurts.
I miss her too.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.763
This is-This is very important.
Do you have the key?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.496

I couldn't find it.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.266

is allergic to fish.

Oh, I didn't tell you the best part.
Here's the best part.
Hmm.

Trudy, don't get mad.

some compensation.

that key goes. Maybe it's
to something really valuable.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.803
No, no. It's not valuable, Zach.
I told you.

- So, tell me how much.
Give me a number.
- <i>A thousand dollars. It's not that much.</i>

12:11.297 --> 12:12.821
Fine. I'll have it today.

Who are you?

12:37.356 --> 12:41.315
Natalie Teeger.
I work for your-

12:41.393 --> 12:44.590
I work for Adrian.
I need that camera.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.756
Just please tell me
what's going on.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.266
Have you told
Adrian about me?

12:51.337 --> 12:54.932
Don't.
You can't.

12:55.007 --> 12:57.032
If you care about him at all,
you can't tell him.

12:58.344 --> 13:00.642
We both know
this would kill him.

13:00.713 --> 13:04.376
I'm dead.
I have to stay that way.

with that one?
Oh, that was lopsided.

Here, you do the buns.

Hey, guys.
Well-done, please.

Well-done. Bun.
Need a bun.
The bun.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.585
Thanks.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.827
Okay, that-
That's a little off center.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.368
I could- I could
reposition that for you.

13:57.436 --> 14:01.395
Or you know what?
I'm gonna- I'm gonna l-
I'm gonna let it go.

You know,
the commissioner asked me...

14:13.886 --> 14:17.083
what I thought about
bringing you back
on a contingency basis.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.453
I told him I thought
we should try it.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.187

Captain-
No. Don't say anything.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.893
Okay.
We'll take it one day

14:33.639 --> 14:35.573
Excuse me.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.609
Oh, listen.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.611
There's a-

14:41.814 --> 14:46.183
There's a few things
that I should say
that I don't.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.984
I mean, I've been working
on a few things myself.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.521
Well, you're not perfect,
God knows, but...

14:57.062 --> 14:59.690
you're still probably
the best cop I've ever met.

15:01.433 --> 15:04.493
And working with you
has been one of
the great honors of my life.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.940
You're the man.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.942
And I mean that.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.646
Right back at ya, sir.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.685
I love you, man.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.290
Yeah, I love you too.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.596
Oh, yeah.
He said I was the man.

Hey, Paulie? It's a red alert.
Tell Karen that
we're almost out of beer.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.452
Captain, do you
have a minute?
Sure.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.320
Uh, gosh, I know
this sounds weird, but...

15:59.391 --> 16:01.518
were you there
when Trudy died?

16:03.395 --> 16:05.329
Who? Trudy Monk?

16:05.397 --> 16:08.298
No, no. I got there
an hour later. Why?

16:08.367 --> 16:10.301
So, you didn't actually
see the body?

16:11.603 --> 16:13.594
What are you getting at?

16:15.341 --> 16:18.799
I met her...
this morning.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.868
I talked to her.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.588
Finally.
Here's your money.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.597
You can count it
if you want.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.428
[Clears Throat]
I've changed my mind.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.936
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.673
MyJanice gave me this key.
She didn't leave it for you.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.735
Why do you think
she did that?

16:53.812 --> 16:56.007
Well, she couldn't leave it
to me, could she?
Huh?

16:56.081 --> 16:58.140
She thought I was dead.

16:58.217 --> 17:02.278
I've decided to leave
all her papers and her notebooks
to the university.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.653
Zach-Zach-

17:05.723 --> 17:07.954
Janice and I worked
on that story together.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.961
Those papers belong
to both of us.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.795
[Sighs]
L-I don't know.
I have to think.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.800
This isn't a game!
Give me the key!

17:15.867 --> 17:17.768
Trudy, what are you doing?
Give me the key.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.861
Stop it! Trudy!
Just give it to me!

<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>It's not possible. It's impossible.</i>

own death to protect him.

17:44.630 --> 17:48.828
She talked to a paramedic
before she died.
Okay, but maybe he was lying.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.835
Or-Or maybe
he was in on it.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.804

She's been meeting a man,

17:53.872 --> 17:56.238

Ellinghouse?
No.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.804
Yeah, they've been arguing
about a key.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.246
He has some key
that belongs to her.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.250
How many of those
have you had?

18:06.318 --> 18:08.946
Captain, I saw Trudy Monk.
Did you take her picture?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.955
Yeah, but she took the film.

<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>Captain.!</i>

- Now?
- Neighbor heard a fight.
Door was open.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.856
She went in, found a body.

18:20.933 --> 18:24.425

grab Philby and Dietrich.

- Victim's name was Ellinghouse.
- Ellinghouse?

Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse.
Why? You know him?

Nothing.

one in Mission Hill.

No. Hey, hey, hey, Monk.

Look, we don't need you
on this one.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.027

Look, uh, clean the grill.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.859
The grill is
really greasy.
Yeah.

18:52.931 --> 18:54.865
What?
Yeah, yeah, come on.
It'll be fun.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.493

Oh, it's really dusty in here.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.974
Mr. -Mr. Monk, maybe
you should wait in the car.

No, no, no. I'm fine.
You know, Monk,
we can't pay you for this.

Least I could do.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.216

on the desk, face down.

<i>Uh, he fell onto this thing,</i>
<i>rolled over onto the floor.</i>
<i>What do you call that thing?</i>

Wasn't premeditated.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.874
Oh, there was a struggle...
with a woman.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.880
A woman?
How do you know that?

19:42.948 --> 19:45.815
Heel marks in the carpet.
Oh, she had very small feet.

19:45.884 --> 19:47.818
A lot of women
have small feet.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.902
She wore perfume.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.531

Wait.

No reading glasses.

stashed in this book.

- A key. Did they find a key?
- No. No, nothing.

Yeah. His name's Zach-
Zach Ellinghouse.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.184
Oh, no!

20:57.256 --> 20:59.451
Ellinghouse, Natalie.

his daughter, Janice,

21:04.596 --> 21:07.724

It's weird you keep
mentioning Trudy.

Look, M-Maybe if we just got-
if we got a sample of her D.N.A.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.113
No. No!
No, that way we'd know
where we stand.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.118
Trudy's D.N.A.?
What are you saying?

22:34.186 --> 22:38.020
Maybe we could just exhume the body.
Look, we're miles away
from exhuming anything.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.287
She said she faked her
own death to protect you.

was it her?

He's not sure.
She was too far away.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.941

24:23.261 --> 24:25.957
The license number?
He doesn't remember.

Wait. Did I authorize that?
No, sir.

remember?

out for him,

we have enough
to exhume the body.

25:07.639 --> 25:10.005
You just have to
say the word.
Look, hey, no, no.

up without Monk's okay.

We think she faked her
own death and has been
hiding out ever since.

And we're pretty sure
she killed a guy earlier today.
Trudy's our primary suspect.

All right. All right.
So he's having a psychotic break.
He's delusional.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.083
Okay.

26:27.385 --> 26:29.319
Adrian.

26:33.024 --> 26:35.185
Okay.

26:35.260 --> 26:38.024
[Whispers]
Good.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.030
Adrian,

26:40.098 --> 26:45.593
I'm not going
to believe anything
until I hear it from you.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.604
Is Trudy alive?

26:52.577 --> 26:54.511
I don't know.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.714
But if it's true,

26:58.984 --> 27:00.918
then nothing is true.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.755
If this is true,

27:07.025 --> 27:08.959
nothing is true.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.259
Why didn't
she contact me?
I don't know.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.200
I don't know.
Maybe she's in trouble.

27:18.269 --> 27:21.397
She's in trouble.
A-Adrian,
where are you going?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.636
[Kroger]
Adrian?
Hey, Monk?

27:27.112 --> 27:29.307
Monk,
where are you going?
I have to find her.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.508
We'll go with you.
No. I have to do this alone.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.950
This is between
me and my wife.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.284
[Sobs]

28:10.689 --> 28:12.623
She's not you.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.594
It's not you.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.596
[Exhales]

28:33.111 --> 28:35.409
Hi. How you doing?

28:35.480 --> 28:40.247
Hi.
My wife
is buried back there.

28:40.318 --> 28:42.684
[Sighs]
She's still dead.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.949
[Exhales]

28:45.023 --> 28:47.457
She's right where I left her.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.686
Okay.
And I am so...

28:51.763 --> 28:53.697
relieved.

28:53.765 --> 28:56.199
I mean, I love her
with all my heart,

28:56.267 --> 28:58.201
but-

28:58.269 --> 29:00.294
[Sighs]

29:00.371 --> 29:02.305
Who's this?

29:03.374 --> 29:05.569
<i>This is my husband.</i>
<i>Ah.</i>

29:05.643 --> 29:08.703
I'm sure he's dead too.

29:09.814 --> 29:11.941
And he'll stay dead.
Don't worry about that.

29:12.016 --> 29:14.416
This is an excellent cemetery.
They know what they're doing.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.921
Everybody here-
probably dead.

29:20.024 --> 29:21.958
Nice talking to you.

29:26.397 --> 29:29.924
<i>[Phone Ringing]</i>

29:30.001 --> 29:32.595
That's it, there.
Trudy's desk?

29:32.670 --> 29:34.604
For five years.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.799
She loved this job.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.944
I did that.

29:41.012 --> 29:43.207
<i>I was leaning in to kiss her,</i>

29:43.281 --> 29:45.215
spilled some coffee.
[Chuckles]

29:45.283 --> 29:47.751
I bet it was the last
time you spilled anything
in your life.

29:47.819 --> 29:51.778
Oh, I spilled something
seven years later-
January 12, 1999.

29:51.856 --> 29:54.188
January 12? You mean
during the earthquake?

29:54.259 --> 29:58.161
Earthquakes count.
I don't make the rules.

30:00.198 --> 30:02.496
Mr. Monk, could I ask
you something?

30:02.567 --> 30:04.831
<i>What happened yesterday</i>
<i>in the cemetery?</i>

30:06.204 --> 30:09.071
How do you know the woman
we've been seeing isn't Trudy?

30:09.140 --> 30:12.007
We still have one or two
copies in the archives.
You can keep that one.

30:12.076 --> 30:14.670
I don't understand.
Why would anybody
want to impersonate Trudy?

30:14.746 --> 30:18.682
I don't know.
I wish some of these kids
would impersonate her a little bit.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.150
She was the best
reporter I ever knew.

30:21.219 --> 30:25.417
Here it is- "Peer Pressure"
byJanice Ellinghouse
and Trudy Monk.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.687
It was the only article
they ever wrote together.
It's a hell of a piece.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.284
<i>It should have won</i>
<i>a Pulitzer.</i>
Yeah.

30:30.361 --> 30:34.161
- It was on the dockworkers' union?
- Ed Lindley, the union president,
was indicted because of that.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.757
He's still in jail.
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>The guy was untouchable.</i>

30:36.835 --> 30:40.703
But Trudy and Janice
never stopped digging.
That article made history.

30:40.772 --> 30:43.263
<i>Lindley's second-in-command,</i>
<i>Jack Bollinger,</i>

30:43.341 --> 30:45.275
became the union president
because of this.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.743
He's still there. Seems to be
running a pretty clean shop.

30:47.812 --> 30:49.746
Whoa, they are really
naming names here.

30:49.814 --> 30:51.509
Look at all these payoffs.

30:51.583 --> 30:56.543
How did they get all this?
Hard work and a secret informant.
Deep background.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.612
Trudy never told <i>me</i>
who it was.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.090
Well, they never told me either.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.218
Where was
Janice's desk?

31:03.294 --> 31:06.388
Over there. Still haven't
cleaned it out yet.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.830
It's, uh, hard to
say good-bye.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.834
Yes, it is.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.145
- "Pay rent."
- <i>Yeah, so?</i>

31:25.216 --> 31:27.446
She was already
paying a mortgage.

31:27.518 --> 31:31.955
What could she be renting?
What-What-What can you
rent for a hundred and five dollars?

31:32.023 --> 31:35.982
I rent a storage locker.
It costs about that much
per month.

31:38.196 --> 31:42.963
The missing key-
the one from the book.
It could have opened a locker.

31:43.034 --> 31:48.370
Mr. Monk, there are hundreds
of storage lockers in San Francisco.
Where would we even start?

31:48.439 --> 31:50.464
Well, Natalie,

31:50.541 --> 31:54.102
how about
Trans-Cal Moving and Storage,
13025 Third Street?

31:54.178 --> 31:56.112
What?

32:00.885 --> 32:02.819
Th-This storage place-
what time does it open?

32:02.887 --> 32:05.720
<i>[Trudy] 8:00.</i>
I'm gonna need you
to come along with me.

32:05.790 --> 32:09.453
Why? You said
once I got you the key,
I could leave.

32:09.527 --> 32:12.655
Change of plans.
I don't know what kind
of security they're gonna have.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.995
If we're stopped,
I'm gonna need you
to pretend to beJanice.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.001
Oh, and bring that along.
She was a blonde too.

32:18.069 --> 32:20.594
I hate this thing.
Why? It looks
pretty good on you.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.106
Then, you looked pretty good
as the redhead in that show.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.699
<i>What was it</i>
<i>called again?</i>
A man is dead.

32:28.546 --> 32:30.480
Yeah, I know that.

32:30.548 --> 32:34.348
And I am sorry.
It was a terrible accident.
And that other guy-Trudy's husband.

32:34.419 --> 32:38.185
I will never forget his face.
I mean, he was really hurting.

32:38.256 --> 32:40.190
Look, things happen.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.192
We're moving on.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.956
This is all about
self-preservation now.
Do you understand?

32:45.029 --> 32:49.329
If whatever is in
that storage locker ever gets out,
I am a dead man.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.334
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.

32:51.402 --> 32:54.963
Look-Look.
You're an actress, aren't you?

32:55.039 --> 32:57.371
Well, our little show
is not over yet.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.949
[Chattering]

33:12.623 --> 33:14.557
[Stottlemeyer]
Good morning.

33:15.827 --> 33:19.558
What's going on?
Organizing a task force.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.757
Out of my office?
Yes, sir.

33:21.833 --> 33:25.599
Well, I figured
you wouldn't mind.
I'm the man, right?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.729
Yeah, that's right.
You're the man.

33:27.805 --> 33:29.739
Don't worry, sir.
I am all over this one.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.833
I've reassigned Rudner
and Sergeant Hyden.
They're already on their way in.

33:32.910 --> 33:36.539
The report from the lab.
There were no identifiable prints
in the apartment.

33:36.614 --> 33:39.344
Trudy must have wiped
everything down before she left.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.612
I'm running off 5,000 of those-
"Wanted for Questioning."

33:41.686 --> 33:45.281
I put a photo of her
up on the hot board,
and I've been trying to contact her parents.

33:46.457 --> 33:49.221
W-Wait, are you-
Wait. You've been trying
to contact whose parents?

33:49.293 --> 33:52.456
Trudy's. In case
she tries to call them.
No, Randy. Wait, wait, wait-

33:52.530 --> 33:55.431
And I'm, uh,
releasing that to the press.
It's a press release.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.266
Oh, uh, I called the deputy
commissioner too. Just want-
Lieutenant!

33:59.337 --> 34:01.271
Excuse me, gentlemen.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.812
[Groans]

34:11.449 --> 34:13.382
Randall,

34:13.451 --> 34:15.885
when I said that about-

34:15.953 --> 34:18.217
about you being the man,

34:21.458 --> 34:23.393
I thought I was
talking to Monk.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.868
Oh.

34:34.038 --> 34:35.972
Okay.
Well, that explains it.

34:36.040 --> 34:39.134
Randy, it doesn't mean
that I don't appreciate-
No, l-I understand.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.143
No problem.

34:41.212 --> 34:43.271
Why don't I just get you
a cup of coffee?

34:45.349 --> 34:47.783
Won't be needing that.

34:49.020 --> 34:50.954
[Sighs]

35:06.370 --> 35:08.668
It's number 12.
Number 12.
How do you know?

35:08.739 --> 35:10.673
I saw the list.

35:10.741 --> 35:12.675
The security guard just
showed you the list?

35:12.743 --> 35:15.576
Not exactly.
I caught a glimpse of it
as he was bending over.

35:15.646 --> 35:19.013
Why was he bending over?
To help me look
for my earring.

35:19.083 --> 35:23.076
[Gasps]
I lost my earring.
Oh, my God.

35:23.154 --> 35:26.419
It's irreplaceable.
It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa
on her deathbed.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.085
I think it might have
fallen over there.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.798
Maybe she's already been here.
No.

35:34.866 --> 35:39.235
There's water in the handle
from the rain last night.

35:39.303 --> 35:42.397
It would have spilled out
if she lifted the door.

35:44.008 --> 35:46.476
Listen. Listen.

35:51.349 --> 35:53.544
<i>[Monk]</i>
<i>That's the car I saw.</i>

35:53.618 --> 35:55.552
It's gotta be her.
<i>Come on.</i>

35:55.620 --> 35:57.554
It's her. It's her.

36:05.730 --> 36:09.427
Mr. Monk, they're gonna see you.
What are you doing? Get down.
I had her back.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.094
[Sighs]
For an hour and a half,

36:12.170 --> 36:14.536
I thought she might be alive.
Psst.

36:19.977 --> 36:23.276
[Exhales]
I had hope.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.907
Isn't hope the worst?

36:25.983 --> 36:28.451
No, Mr. Monk.
Hope is a good thing.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.454
You're very young.

36:36.994 --> 36:40.054
I know this guy.
I've seen him before.

36:40.131 --> 36:42.929
Do you have the article
that Trudy and Janice wrote?
Yeah.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.399
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:44.468 --> 36:47.631
That's him.
Jack Bollinger.

36:47.705 --> 36:51.300
- The union boss.
- <i>He was their anonymous source</i>
<i>10 years ago.</i>

36:51.375 --> 36:54.367
<i>Now that they're both gone,</i>
<i>he must be panicked...</i>

36:54.445 --> 36:57.209
that all of their research material
will be made public.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.952
And his old friends will know
that he ratted them out.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.922
What about the woman?

37:04.989 --> 37:08.117
Bollinger must have
just found her.

37:08.192 --> 37:11.821
It was a con game
to trickJanice's father
into giving up that key.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.797
I don't get it.
How did she know
so much about Trudy?

37:14.865 --> 37:16.799
Bollinger must have
coached her.

37:17.868 --> 37:20.302
He spent time with Trudy
when they were writing this,

37:20.371 --> 37:22.532
so he knew a lot about her.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.541
I'm calling the captain.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.113
<i>[Stottlemeyer]</i>
<i>Lieutenant, we're rolling.</i>
<i>That was Natalie.</i>

37:32.183 --> 37:34.879
Monk broke the case.
They're at a storage locker
right up the street.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.886
Randy.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.979
Randy!
Let's go.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.184
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you talking to me?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.194
[Sighs]
It's just hard
to tell sometimes.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.130
Randy,

37:47.198 --> 37:49.189
you know how fragile Monk is.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.498
I have to stroke him all the time.
But you're tougher than that.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.505
Come on.
You're the man. Let's go.
Oh, so everybody's the man.

37:57.074 --> 37:59.269
No. Just you and Monk.

37:59.343 --> 38:02.608
You're my <i>two</i> men.
Let's go.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.274
If we were both drowning,
who would you save?

38:05.349 --> 38:07.283
I don't know-
both of you.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.581
No, if you could
only save one of us.

38:09.654 --> 38:13.522
I'd probably save Monk
because he can't swim,
and I know you're an excellent swimmer.

38:13.591 --> 38:15.525
Suppose I was
holding an anchor?

38:16.527 --> 38:19.291
You're holding an anchor?
Uh-huh.
Who would you save then?

38:19.363 --> 38:22.560
Well, why don't you
let go of the anchor?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.624
It's a family heirloom.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.172
I'm leaving.

38:46.023 --> 38:49.322
Mr. Bollinger,
can I go now?
Go start the car.

38:49.393 --> 38:51.520
No, no.
Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy.

38:51.595 --> 38:53.995
Let's just wait for
the captain. Just-

38:55.499 --> 38:58.093
Stay here.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.103
What the hell
are you doing?

39:00.171 --> 39:04.039
I found some notebooks
and some tapes,
but they're not all labeled,

39:04.108 --> 39:06.770
and... I can't afford
to miss anything.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.938
<i>So we...</i>

39:10.014 --> 39:12.608
are going to Plan B.
Oh, Mr. -

39:12.683 --> 39:16.517
- Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that!
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
- Start the damn car!

39:16.587 --> 39:18.384
Trudy?

39:18.456 --> 39:21.948
- What the hell is he doing here?
- I'm her husband.

39:25.629 --> 39:29.360
<i>Son of a bitch, it never ends.</i>
<i>H- How did he find us?</i>

39:29.433 --> 39:32.163
<i>Who else knows we're here?</i>

39:32.236 --> 39:34.204
<i>Hey, I'm talking to you.</i>
Your hair-

39:34.271 --> 39:37.104
hair was more like- like-

39:37.174 --> 39:39.540
[Stammering]
Look, l-I didn't know, okay?

39:39.610 --> 39:41.373
L-I thought this was just a job.

39:44.014 --> 39:46.482
First row, number 12!
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

39:49.954 --> 39:52.286
You, freak show,
get away from her.

39:52.356 --> 39:54.449
No, Mr. Bollinger, don't.
Trudy, listen.

39:54.525 --> 39:57.221
Okay, that is enough!
No, no, no! Don't!

39:57.294 --> 39:59.558
<i>Don't.!</i>

39:59.630 --> 40:01.564
<i>They're gonna find</i>
<i>a body in the ashes here.!</i>

40:01.632 --> 40:04.192
I have no choice!
He knows too much!

40:05.469 --> 40:07.460
- Oh, God.
- <i>[Stottlemeyer] Hey.!</i>

40:08.839 --> 40:11.103
[Yelps]

40:24.655 --> 40:28.091
[Groaning]

40:30.895 --> 40:32.829
[Panting]

40:34.932 --> 40:36.957
Oh, I'm so sorry.

40:41.872 --> 40:43.806
You loved her.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.380
I'll tell her.

41:13.504 --> 41:15.768
<i>[Natalie]</i>
<i>Well, I think it stinks.</i>
<i>What stinks?</i>

41:15.840 --> 41:17.774
The department deciding
not to reinstate you.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.776
They didn't even
give you a chance.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.778
You can't really
blame them.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.815
After what happened,
I'm kind of back to-

41:24.882 --> 41:26.816
What? Normal?

41:26.884 --> 41:30.217
Well, to- to kind of normal.
Uh-

41:30.287 --> 41:33.484
What?
Wait a second.
Uh, I touched that one twice.

41:33.557 --> 41:35.491
I have to-

41:37.061 --> 41:39.256
You know, Mr. Monk,
you never told me.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.264
What happened
in the cemetery?

41:41.332 --> 41:44.062
How did you know
that that woman
wasn't really Trudy?

41:45.135 --> 41:47.069
Well, I went to the grave,

41:48.138 --> 41:50.299
and it still hurt.

41:50.374 --> 41:52.899
So I knew.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.911
Yeah, I know that hurt.

41:54.979 --> 41:57.539
It's never wrong.

41:57.615 --> 42:01.415
Nope. It isn't.
Neither are you.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.687
