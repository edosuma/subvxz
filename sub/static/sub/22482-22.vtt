[applause, whooping]

00:12.403 --> 00:14.666
Five years sober.
Congratulations.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.668
I sponsored her four
years, eleven months,

00:16.712 --> 00:20.411
but the new sponsor gets
to hold the cake. Okay.

00:20.455 --> 00:23.762
I gave birth to her.
Look where I'’msitting.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.068
Christy, alcoholic.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.113
OTHERS:
Hi, Christy.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.766
First, I want to thank Nora,

00:27.810 --> 00:30.595
my new sponsor,
for giving me my cake

00:30.639 --> 00:32.597
and just being
the best.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.600
And the knife
gets a twist.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.428
This year has been fantastic.

00:37.472 --> 00:40.431
I was in an...
an amazing, healthy relationship

00:40.475 --> 00:42.955
with a man who is now
marrying someone else.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.088
I think this weekend.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.264
I didn'’tget into law school.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.962
Oh, and we got robbed.
At Christmas.

00:50.006 --> 00:52.269
How'’s that for a lump of coal?

00:52.313 --> 00:55.620
Does she know what
"fantastic" means?

00:55.664 --> 00:57.840
Five years ago,
any one of those things

00:57.883 --> 00:59.581
would have destroyed me.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.452
But now,

01:01.496 --> 01:03.628
a few hours
of uncontrollable sobbing,

01:03.672 --> 01:05.804
and I'’m good to go.

01:05.848 --> 01:08.111
For example, uh, this past week,

01:08.155 --> 01:10.679
I gambled away $4,000
of my friend'’s money,

01:10.722 --> 01:13.073
and stranded my mom
in a jail cell.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.814
Ooh. I got a shout-out.

01:15.858 --> 01:19.079
But, hey, I am cleaning up my
mess, '’cause that's what we do.

01:19.122 --> 01:22.256
And to the newcomers, please
don'’t let all of that scare you.

01:22.299 --> 01:23.996
Believe it or not,

01:24.040 --> 01:26.695
I am the best version of me
that I'’ve ever been.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.479
I mean,

01:28.523 --> 01:31.134
I haven'’t slept with anyone
in this room, so...

01:31.178 --> 01:33.180
that must count for something.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.746
Oh.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.097
I didn'’t see you there, Tim.
Sorry.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.057
♪

01:59.075 --> 02:00.685
Now, I want you
to do that writing

02:00.729 --> 02:02.165
about what you
did in Reno.

02:02.209 --> 02:05.037
Well, I started
to write about it,

02:05.081 --> 02:07.127
and then I started doodling,

02:07.170 --> 02:09.694
and, uh, then I drew
a pretty funny picture

02:09.738 --> 02:11.348
of my mom in jail.

02:13.089 --> 02:16.136
Does that count?
Christy.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.268
But if I write it all down, then
I'’m gonna have to look at it.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.009
That'’s the point.
If you don'’t look at it,

02:20.052 --> 02:21.097
you'’ll end up
doing it again.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.055
Okay, got it.
Got it, got it, got it.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.362
But...

02:25.406 --> 02:27.190
five years sober.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.192
[chuckles] Amazing.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.498
Whoo!

02:33.065 --> 02:35.329
I feel like
I'’m celebrating alone.

02:35.372 --> 02:38.636
I'’ll celebrate when
you do your writing.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.029
Okay.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.987
So, what'’s new with you?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.772
Uh-uh. You know I
don'’t do the chitchat.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.209
But you know all
the gory details of mylife.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.342
I don'’t even know
what your favorite color is.

02:48.385 --> 02:51.171
Think... about it.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.783
And I will see
you on Tuesday.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.220
Yep. See you then.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.223

Christy flying in.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
Nora'’s not gonna join us?

03:03.313 --> 03:05.228
No. She doesn'’t do the whole

03:05.272 --> 03:06.708
"friends with her sponsees"
thing.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.492
Oh. She'’s one of those.

03:08.536 --> 03:11.103
Well, some of us are
able to do both.

03:11.147 --> 03:14.585
I have a girl crush
on Bitter Marjorie.

03:14.629 --> 03:18.023
Bitter Marjorie
would eat you alive.

Stop it or
I'’ll come over there.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.028
[laughs]

03:23.072 --> 03:26.249
Oh, oh, Jill, I'’ve got some more
of the money that I owe you.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.555
Payment number three.

03:27.598 --> 03:28.860
Thank you, Christy.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.906
Only 37 to go.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.345
I mean, only 37 to go!

03:35.389 --> 03:37.217
I'’m taking extra shifts,

03:37.260 --> 03:40.220
so your next payment
will have a little bonus in it.

03:40.263 --> 03:43.179
[laughs] It'’s not really
a bonus if it'’s my money.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.923
That'’s great!
I can'’t wait!

03:49.620 --> 03:52.014
Five years.

I remember you walking
into your first meeting.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.324
'’Cause I was there.

03:57.367 --> 04:00.631
Oh, my God. I forgot to
thank you when I took my cake.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.111
Really? I didn'’t notice.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.680
Well, thank you all.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.204
I could never have gotten
this far without you guys.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.119
And I definitely
wouldn'’t be graduating.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.294
You hear that, Marjorie?

04:11.338 --> 04:13.122
We got lumped into
a group thank-you.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.166
CHRISTY:
Oh.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.777
Which reminds me,

04:15.820 --> 04:18.910
I have your tickets
for the graduation ceremony.

04:18.954 --> 04:22.436
Don'’t you worry, I will show up
this time fully clothed.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.177
Honey, we'’re looking
forward to it.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.267
Really, what a
moment for you.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.487
Now? Can we do it now?

04:30.531 --> 04:33.534
Well, I guess we have to,
don'’t we, poker face?

04:33.577 --> 04:35.797
We all chipped in

04:35.840 --> 04:38.843
and got you a little something
to wear to your graduation.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.802
[chuckles softly]

04:42.282 --> 04:44.284
Oh, my God, they'’re gorgeous.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.286
[chuckling]

04:46.329 --> 04:47.896
Are these real diamonds?

04:47.939 --> 04:50.072
I choose not to take that
personally.

04:50.115 --> 04:53.031
Oh, honey, you worked so hard.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.946
You deserve them.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.775
I'’m not gonna lie, I feel, like,
a million times better

04:57.819 --> 04:59.908
about myself
than I did two minutes ago.

04:59.951 --> 05:01.910
[laughter]

05:07.568 --> 05:09.744
You'’ve got to be kidding.

05:09.787 --> 05:12.660
I just wanted to see
if it'’d make me feel smarter.

05:12.703 --> 05:13.922
And?

05:13.965 --> 05:16.838
Who could feel smart
in a hat this stupid?

05:16.881 --> 05:18.840
Well, take it off.
You'’re stretching it out.

05:18.883 --> 05:21.321
Hey, let'’s not go down the road
of who stretched out what,

05:21.364 --> 05:23.018
'’cause I'm gonna win,
pumpkin head.

05:24.498 --> 05:27.022
I never got to wear
one of these.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.024
It'’s never too late.
There'’s an 84-year-old lady

05:29.067 --> 05:31.200
in my history class,
and she aced it.

05:31.243 --> 05:33.507
Course she did.
She lived through most of it.

05:33.550 --> 05:37.728
The professor made that joke.
He got brought up on charges.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.862
What?

05:40.905 --> 05:44.387
It'’s just,
when you were really young,

05:44.431 --> 05:48.391
I looked into that sweet,
innocent face of yours,

05:48.435 --> 05:50.393
and I thought,
"My little girl'’s

05:50.437 --> 05:52.352
gonna grow up to be
something special."

05:52.395 --> 05:55.224
And then I saw you twirling
in the yard, and I thought,

05:55.267 --> 05:56.704
"Maybe she'’ll be a dancer."

05:56.747 --> 05:59.054
And then you said,
"I'’m dizzy, Mom.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.708
It feels so good."

06:02.797 --> 06:06.496
And I thought, "Uh-oh."

06:06.540 --> 06:09.630
Yeah, we both know
the rest of that story.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.154
Yeah. But look
at you now.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.504
I'’m so proud of you.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.333
Thanks, Mom.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.856
Are you proud of me?

06:20.423 --> 06:22.077
Yes.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.732
Why? Why are you proud of me?
Tell me a reason.

06:24.775 --> 06:27.038
Okay. Well...

06:27.082 --> 06:29.345
you pulled your life
out of the gutter,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.434
you'’re sober,
you'’re getting married,

06:31.478 --> 06:33.175
and not because you'’re pregnant

06:33.218 --> 06:35.220
or sneaking somebody
into the country.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.701
But none of those things
get me a funny hat.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.356
Yes, it does.
A wedding veil is a funny hat.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.879
You'’re right.

06:41.923 --> 06:44.491
Oh. [gasps]
You know what I could do?

06:44.534 --> 06:46.841
I could put on a fake
mustache underneath,

06:46.884 --> 06:49.931
so when Adam lifts it to
kiss me at the ceremony,

06:49.974 --> 06:53.064
he'’s like, "Oh! I'm marrying
a third base coach!"

06:53.108 --> 06:55.719
Bam! Viral wedding video.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.678
Okay, great.
This'’ll hold me.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.159
Mom. The gown.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.813
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.035
Oh, my God!
I missed you so much.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.516
[turns off TV]Who'’s my little man?

07:09.559 --> 07:11.605
Who'’s my little man?

07:11.648 --> 07:14.825
Did you miss me?
I missed you.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.827
[kissing noisily]

07:16.871 --> 07:19.177
Hey.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.832
I'’m starting to wonder
if you like Gus better.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.661
Oh, please don'’t wonder.
I definitely do.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.316
Before I forget, here'’s
Christy'’s payment for this week.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.449
Hey, do we got
to keep on doing this?

07:29.492 --> 07:31.015
I mean, Christy'’s
practically family,

07:31.059 --> 07:33.322
and this is what
you do with family.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.194
You know, you lend them money,
they never pay you back,

07:36.238 --> 07:37.848
then you quietly resent them

07:37.892 --> 07:39.850
when they buy
something expensive.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.852
But this is a
different situation.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.507
It'’s important for her sobriety
that she'’s accountable.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.379
Okay, okay.
You'’re the boss.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.686
But is it always
gonna be like this?

07:49.730 --> 07:51.645
Me the boss?
Absolutely.

07:51.688 --> 07:55.344
No. This never-ending chaos
around here.

07:55.387 --> 07:58.173
What chaos?Bail money, drunk friends...

07:58.216 --> 08:00.741
me not being allowed
to go to my brother'’s wedding.

08:00.784 --> 08:04.048
You had a choice.
Did I?

08:04.092 --> 08:06.442
Hey, listen,
all I'’m saying is,

08:06.486 --> 08:09.271
are we ever gonna get to a point
where we have a few days

08:09.314 --> 08:11.752
where there'’s...
just not a crisis, you know?

08:11.795 --> 08:14.972
That we'’re just bored.Shh. Just be pretty.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.762
Ooh. Check out
the pimp roll.

08:21.805 --> 08:25.853
Yeah. I told my customers
the story of the lowly waitress

08:25.896 --> 08:28.769
who defied the odds
to graduate from college.

08:28.812 --> 08:31.772
They lapped it up
like sweet cream.

08:31.815 --> 08:34.688
Yes, people are dumb.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.734
Say, have you ever thought
about investing that money

08:37.778 --> 08:39.562
in a sure thing?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.651
Rudy, I'’m not selling
fake Japanese knives

08:41.695 --> 08:43.914
out of the trunk
of my car again.

08:43.958 --> 08:47.831
I was talking about the poker
game that'’s about to start.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.441
Oh, my God. No.

08:49.485 --> 08:52.096
I need this to pay back
money I lost gambling.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.882
Yes, but if you win, you
could pay it back faster.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.322
No. No, I can'’t.

09:00.365 --> 09:03.368
Is that a no
or a "no"?

09:03.412 --> 09:04.935
It'’s a hard no.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.850
I'’ve learned my lesson.
What'’s the buy-in?

09:06.894 --> 09:08.243
King-high flush.

09:08.286 --> 09:11.289
Well, finally
you have a good hand.

09:12.769 --> 09:15.467
Unfortunately, mine is better.
Full house.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.165
No!

09:17.208 --> 09:19.907
Must you do that
after every hand?

09:23.388 --> 09:28.002
Ah. Paul reminds me that we have
our 5:00 a.m. Pilates class.

09:28.045 --> 09:30.570
No, no, no, no.
No one is leaving.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.746
I need to win
my money back.

09:32.789 --> 09:36.097
After all...
I'’m just a lowly waitress

09:36.140 --> 09:39.100
who defied the odds
to graduate from college.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.059
I crawled through a tunnel
to get into Arizona.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.803
[crying]

09:50.590 --> 09:52.200
You'’re embarrassing yourself.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.636
Fine.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.638
You told me I was gonna win.

09:55.682 --> 09:56.683
You told me I
was gonna win.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.033
And what do you know?
I'’m up $1,500.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.382
Chef Rudy out.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.645
So help me God,
I will tell everyone

10:02.689 --> 10:05.430
your housemaid gnocchi
is from Costco.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.694
What the hell, one more hand.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.049
Everybody get some
sparkling cider so we can toast

10:15.092 --> 10:16.441
the graduation girl
when she gets here.

10:16.485 --> 10:17.660
You throw a nice party, Jill.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.662
Honey, should we have
our wedding here?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
As long as the baby
beef Wellington

10:21.142 --> 10:22.665
is part of the package.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.754
Is this room booked
next June 2nd?

10:24.798 --> 10:27.278
If I'’m the maid of honor,
we can talk about it.

10:27.322 --> 10:28.758
Christy who?

10:29.933 --> 10:31.761
I didn'’t expect
to see you here.

10:31.805 --> 10:35.112
I thought you didn'’t do the
"friends with sponsees" thing.

10:35.156 --> 10:39.116
Well, it'’s a special occasion.
And I'’m mad at my husband.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.075
Christy'’s coming.
Christy'’s coming.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.164
Everybody line up
tallest to smallest.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.861
Why? It'’s not
The Sound of Music.

10:45.906 --> 10:49.561
Hi.OTHERS: Hey!

10:49.605 --> 10:52.390
Oh. Oh, my God, you guys.
Thanks.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.916
Ah, they didn'’t tackle me
before I left, so it'’s official.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.047
[laughter]

10:57.091 --> 10:59.049
BOTH:
I'’d like to propose a...

11:00.268 --> 11:02.879
I'’d like to propose...

11:02.923 --> 11:05.012
No, you go.
No, go ahead.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.579
I'’ll go.
I paid for everything.

11:07.623 --> 11:08.885
To Christy.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.061
From the cheap seats,
it was hard to tell

11:11.105 --> 11:13.368
you were 20 years older
than everybody else.

11:14.761 --> 11:18.199
I think what we'’re all trying
to say is congratulation

11:18.242 --> 11:20.549
on being our group'’s
first college graduate.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.159
Well, I graduated
from college.

11:22.203 --> 11:23.508
So did I.
I'’m a nurse.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.379
I have a master'’s.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.294
Yale School of Drama.

11:29.776 --> 11:32.735
Fine, this day is no big deal.
Congratulations, honey.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.520
Apple juice and lobster.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.174
I feel like
a rich five-year-old.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.220
Speech!
Short speech.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.483
None of this could'’ve happened

11:41.526 --> 11:43.180
without the support
of my friends.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.660
I love you all.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.835
Yay.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.663
Congratulations.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.360
Oh. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.710
This wasn'’t necessary.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.973
Well, every college graduate
needs a nice pen.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.540
You really want me
to write stuff down, don'’t you?

11:56.803 --> 11:58.630
It'’s beautiful. Thank you.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.850
It'’s lovely and practical.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.113
Show Nora what we got you.

12:03.157 --> 12:05.855
Darn it.
I knew I forgot something.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.857
You forgot to wear the
only diamond earrings

12:07.901 --> 12:09.250
you'’ve ever had?

12:09.293 --> 12:11.034
I was nervous.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.993
I was afraid
I was gonna lose them.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.646
Wait, I'’m confused.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.953
You forgot them or you were
afraid of losing them?

12:16.997 --> 12:18.825
Both?

12:18.868 --> 12:20.914
Christy, what'’s going on?

12:20.957 --> 12:23.351
I lost them.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.353
I told you she wasn'’t ready
for diamonds.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.963
Hang on.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.226
Where was the last place
you saw them?

12:32.055 --> 12:34.014
In the middle of a poker table.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.058
What?

12:35.102 --> 12:36.364
Oh, no.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.539
You bet them?

12:37.582 --> 12:38.714
I'’m sorry.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.846
I don'’t know
what'’s happening to me.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.412
Nothing is
happening to you.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.545
You did this to yourself.Mom, please, I...

12:43.588 --> 12:46.896
No, you give me so much crap
for every single mistake I make.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.985
Honey, it'’s a party.I don'’t care.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.726
You left me in jail,

12:50.770 --> 12:52.902
you gambled away
my fiancé'’s money,

12:52.946 --> 12:54.425
you gambled away
Jill'’s money,

12:54.469 --> 12:56.514
and now you lost our
graduation present to you?

12:56.558 --> 12:59.300
You have a problem and
you don'’t get to pout

12:59.343 --> 13:02.825
and bat your big, blue eyes and
adorable your way out of it.

13:02.869 --> 13:06.481
Bonnie...
No, I'’m angry and
you all should be, too!

13:13.575 --> 13:15.533
Well, you people
better eat,

13:15.577 --> 13:17.579
'’cause there is no
more fun to be had!

13:20.538 --> 13:22.192
You know, I really
thought the drive

13:22.236 --> 13:24.151
was gonna wash some
of the horror off me,

13:24.194 --> 13:26.675
but I'’m still incredibly
uncomfortable.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.503
Well, then you might want
to cover your ears

13:28.546 --> 13:30.157
'’cause round two
is about to start.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.767
Hang on.
Let me get a beer for this.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.422
Christy!
Come on, let'’s do this.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.903
How you handle this kind of
conflict on apple cider,

13:36.946 --> 13:39.470
I-I'’ll never understand.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.299
Ignoring me won'’t help you.

13:46.042 --> 13:48.436
Why haven'’t I taught you
how to fetch beer yet?

13:49.829 --> 13:52.309
She'’s not here.Her car is here.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.789
Well, where the hell is she?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.356
Where'’d she go, boy?
Where'’d she go?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.010
Did she fall down
the old well?

13:57.053 --> 13:59.055
You think this is funny?

13:59.099 --> 14:01.536
No, no, I do not.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.929
Give me a little
reality check here.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.756
Was I that out of line?Of course not.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.323
I mean, everything I said
had to be said.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.498
Right? Okay.Absolutely. Okay.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.891
I mean, the only question
might be:

14:08.935 --> 14:11.198
was that the right time
to say it?

14:12.242 --> 14:14.766
But I think it was.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.507
What are you trying to say?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.031
Me? I'’m not trying
to say anything.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.686
I think there may be
others who felt

14:21.730 --> 14:23.993
that this was kind of
Christy'’s special night, but...

14:24.037 --> 14:26.343
Stay here in case
she comes home.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.171
I'’m gonna go look for her.

14:28.215 --> 14:30.086
[door opens, closes]

14:30.130 --> 14:33.873
Gus. This is a beer.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.223
Daddy likes beer.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.357
Let'’s go teach you
how to open the fridge!

14:40.401 --> 14:43.273
Come on!

14:43.317 --> 14:45.928
She'’s been gone over an hour,
Marjorie.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.496
I'’m starting to get
a little nervous.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.237
Okay.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.847
Yeah, maybe my timing
wasn'’t great,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.850
but it needed to be said.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.592
If I want your opinion,
I'’ll ask for it.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.811
Yes, I know I asked for it.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.205
Just call me if she turns up.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.035
Jackass.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.907
Oh, thank God.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.438
Want a lift?
Go away.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.831
Come on. I hate it
as much as you do,

15:19.875 --> 15:21.703
but we got to talk about this.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.748
Let me walk in peace.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.489
Okay.

15:28.144 --> 15:31.756
I got half a tank of gas.
I will wear you down.

15:37.023 --> 15:40.765
News flash: cars
can go backwards.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.898
Christy,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.856
the last time you ran away,

15:44.900 --> 15:48.556
I let you go and I didn'’t
see you for two years.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.601
Will you please get in the car?

15:59.349 --> 16:03.701
I'’m only doing this because I
chose to run away in high heels.

16:03.745 --> 16:07.401
Look... it'’s been
brought to my attention

16:07.444 --> 16:10.317
that my timing might
not have been so great.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.189
Really? That had to be
brought to your attention?

16:13.233 --> 16:15.365
I could'’ve waited
till after the party,

16:15.409 --> 16:17.106
but I stand by what I said.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.152
Okay, fine. I screwed up.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.892
I hate to break it
to you, sweetie,

16:20.936 --> 16:22.851
but that was not
just a screwup.

16:22.894 --> 16:25.027
You'’ve got a serious
gambling problem.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.029
That'’s a little dramatic.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.553
No, it'’s not.
I'’m scared for you.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.687
I have seen this take people out
just like drugs and drinking.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.732
This isn'’t anything
like my drinking.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.648
I don'’t do it every day.
It'’s not ruining my life.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.477
Really? Who'’s wearing your
diamond earrings right now?

16:42.349 --> 16:44.873
A busboy'’s
six-month-old daughter.

16:46.918 --> 16:49.486
It can'’t be like my drinking.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.619
Why not?

16:51.662 --> 16:53.664
Because I can'’t have
another addiction.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.362
I can'’t be that broken.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.195
Sure you can.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.463
All right, Christy, think
you got some amends to make.

17:09.506 --> 17:13.423
I know. It just doesn'’t
feel like the right time.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.947
Oh. Well, in that case,
do it now.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.471
Okay.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.342
Call me after.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.344
You really didn'’t
know what you were

17:21.388 --> 17:22.911
getting into
with me, did you?

17:22.954 --> 17:25.740
Nope. But I like a challenge.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.786
[gasps] You just hugged me.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.005
Oh, good Lord.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.659
I'’m hugging you.
I went to your party.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.487
I'’m just breaking all
my doggone rules.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.576
Before you know it,
we'’ll be at the movies.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.795
Never.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.710
Hey, guys.

17:41.799 --> 17:45.064
I owe you an amends,
and that'’s an understatement.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.110
Those earrings meant
so much to me,

17:48.154 --> 17:49.851
and I just threw them away.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.333
It was wrong and I'’m sorry.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.161
Thank you, Christy.

17:56.901 --> 17:59.165
I accept your amends.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.123
I'’m still pissed.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.343
And if anything good
ever happens to you again,

18:03.386 --> 18:05.388
all you'’re getting from me
is a high five.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.436
And maybe a blouse
I don'’t like anymore.

18:10.872 --> 18:12.482
What'’d I miss?

18:12.526 --> 18:13.657
Christy just made an amends.

18:13.701 --> 18:17.574
Damn it!
That stupid Big Gulp.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.447
Okay. Enough of this.
I'’m starving. Let's go eat.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.797
Actually, I'’m not gonna
be able to make it tonight.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.407
Are you sure?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.844
Yeah, you guys go ahead.
I'’ll close up.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.238
All right.
See you at home, then.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.197
See you soon.Good night.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.174
MAN: Before we start,
we have a few things to go over.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.002
The community center asked us
not to smoke on the property.

18:54.045 --> 18:57.223
Excuse me. Is this
the Gamblers Anonymous meeting?

18:57.266 --> 18:59.529
It is. You coming in?

18:59.573 --> 19:01.923
Yeah. I guess I am.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.316
MAN:
You will be towed.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.926
Please respect these requests

19:04.969 --> 19:07.015
so we can continue
to have our meetings here.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.321
Thanks.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.670
MAN: ...and out of respect
for the speaker,

19:09.713 --> 19:10.627
don'’t text during the meeting.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.854
Hey.
Hey.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.378
I brought this home for you,
but then I got hungry.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.207
It'’s okay. I'm not.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.688
How was your night?

19:27.731 --> 19:32.780
Well, I went to my first
Gamblers Anonymous meeting.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.217
You did?
Why didn'’t you tell me?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.698
I didn'’t want
to say anything

19:37.741 --> 19:39.569
unless I knew I was
really doing it.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.267
And it looks like
I'’m doing it.

19:43.443 --> 19:46.359
I got my first day pin.
They don'’t do chips.

19:46.402 --> 19:49.666
Ah, I bet they learned that
the hard way.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.842
[sighs]

19:51.886 --> 19:55.237
It was tough
walking in there.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.500
But on the plus side,
I was the youngest

19:57.544 --> 20:00.851
and the only woman who
wasn'’t wearing a tracksuit.

20:00.895 --> 20:04.028
Those are the two ways
I tell you apart from Marjorie.

20:04.072 --> 20:06.901
I really know how to
ruin my life, don'’t I?

20:06.944 --> 20:10.034
You learned from the best.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.123
But, hey, you'’re doing
something about it.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.301
[both sigh]

20:15.344 --> 20:17.564
I'’m gonna go
take a shower.

20:17.607 --> 20:21.350
I smell like cigars
and ruined marriages.

20:21.394 --> 20:24.310
Oh, uh, hey, before
you go, what'’s this?

20:24.353 --> 20:26.268
What is it?I don'’t know.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.009
You should open it.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
Oh, my God,
I got into law school!

20:33.319 --> 20:35.495
You did?!

20:35.538 --> 20:37.845
You steamed it?Razor blade.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.369
If you'’d hold it the wrong way,
it would'’ve fallen on the floor.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.589
Is it okay
if I jump up and down?

20:42.632 --> 20:43.938
