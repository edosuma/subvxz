00:25.080 --> 00:28.639
This is the BBC Home Service.

00:28.640 --> 00:31.319
On orders from the German army,

00:31.320 --> 00:33.679
the curfew will be relaxed from Monday

00:33.680 --> 00:36.919
to celebrate German-Soviet Friendship Week.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.439
In anticipation of the celebrations,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.639
one of the few surviving Spitfires

00:41.640 --> 00:45.399
will be presented to Soviet
General Zhukov on The Mall today

00:45.400 --> 00:48.159
by German air ace Helmut Vig.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.599
Vice Marshal Goering commented
that Herr Helmut Vig's 58 kills

00:52.600 --> 00:55.519
was a decisive factor in the battle
for air supremacy over Britain

00:55.520 --> 00:59.360
that finally brought peace to Europe...

01:13.320 --> 01:14.640
Urgh!

03:45.280 --> 03:47.159
I have to go.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.239
No, no, no, no, don't rush off.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.840
It's the first whole night
we've had together in ages.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.079
Believe me, I'd love to stay.

03:55.080 --> 03:58.800
Then let's not go in. There's
that flu going around.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.160
- What, both of us?
- A-

04:03.400 --> 04:05.400
I hate that place now.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.799
It's very plush here.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.879
Who else uses these rooms?

04:24.880 --> 04:27.520
A Reichspropagandaleiter.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.000
- What if they come back?
- We'll be shot.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.799
He's visiting the South
West controlled zone.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.600
Aren't you the clever one.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.239
If I quit, would you still see me?

04:49.240 --> 04:50.680
Of course.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.040
- But don't.
- It's all right for you.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.880
Archer of the Yard, all that power.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.240
Don't talk daft, Sylvia.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.960
For God's sake, get away from the window!

05:16.160 --> 05:18.080
Come in.

05:19.880 --> 05:22.839
Don't you like it? It's
covering my modesty.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.920
- Doesn't it do the same for you?
- Don't be a bloody fool.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.200
Ja?

05:44.640 --> 05:47.280
All right. Have you got the murder bag?

05:48.760 --> 05:50.840
Good.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.759
Harry Woods.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.880
A death above an antique
shop, Shepherd Market.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.000
Take that thing off, will you?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.039
Yes, Harry?

06:23.040 --> 06:27.799
Do you get a thrill out of
taking stupid risks, Doug?

06:27.800 --> 06:30.519
Not very subtle, what
you're doing with Sylvia.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.519
How do you know what we get up to?

06:32.520 --> 06:35.039
I don't know what's got into you.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.639
Then just drive, Harry.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.359
Look, all I'm saying is,
not on your own doorstep,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.799
not with your own secretary,
for Christ's sake!

06:41.800 --> 06:43.760
In the... Fritz Ritz!

06:50.720 --> 06:53.199
Those Herberts might act as
if they like you just now,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.959
but they could turn on you any time.

06:55.960 --> 06:58.199
Mind your own business, Sergeant.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.919
Listen, if you have to have it off,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.279
what about that, er...
big-titted German bird

07:02.280 --> 07:03.919
in the Waffen-SS liaison?

07:03.920 --> 07:07.519
THEY LAUGH No? I heard
she puts it about a bit.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.919
I thought you disapproved of
consorting with the Germans.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.159
What's the use?

07:12.160 --> 07:15.039
What do the Resistance
hope to achieve with this?

07:15.040 --> 07:18.320
He gets strung up and his
family sent to a labour camp.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.519
Defiance.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.559
Nothing wrong with a bit of that.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.119
What if the Russki had been killed instead?

07:27.120 --> 07:30.479
That would've put the dampers on their
friendship ceremony, wouldn't it?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.920
Yeah.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.399
I remember I took you around
here when it was my beat.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.879
Young and innocent, you were.

07:57.880 --> 08:01.799
Brand-new diploma, not a clue in the world.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.440
You're choking me up, Harry.

08:05.840 --> 08:10.439
No, I'm just saying, when it
was my beat, it was nice.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.519
No, it wasn't.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.479
Maybe not. The girls were always friendly.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.199
Well, friendship's not always
free around here, is it?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.920
- Hiya, love.
- Hello, Sergeant.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.399
What's going on here?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.719
Well, you ought to know,
you're working with 'em.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.519
Ought to know what?

08:26.520 --> 08:29.159
The Herberts have decided we need
to be examined by their doctors.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.919
Go back in the line!

08:30.920 --> 08:33.239
So it's true, they're
turning the whole area

08:33.240 --> 08:35.078
into an official Wehrmacht brothel.

08:35.080 --> 08:37.999
To the victor, the spoils?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.639
You won't be able to come
around here any more, Harry.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.159
Yeah, very funny.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.279
Inspector Archer?

08:45.280 --> 08:50.119
Sir, is it true the SS are using the
police to chase Resistance fighters?

08:50.120 --> 08:53.280
It's nonsense. We're non-political
and we always will be.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.119
- Morning, Denham.
- Sir.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.000
- Is that the way to the roof?
- Yes, sir.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.000
Morning.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.960
Sorry to disturb, Doc.

09:25.840 --> 09:30.120
Fancy some petrol coupons, Harry?

09:31.440 --> 09:33.560
You could get to Timbuktu on this lot.

09:35.480 --> 09:38.759
Looks like our antique dealer
had a couple of sidelines.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.359
Remember that gang that murdered
the warehouse manager in Fulham?

09:41.360 --> 09:43.999
They were forging Luftwaffe petrol coupons.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.920
Could be the same mob.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.080
Well, Doc?

09:51.080 --> 09:53.839
First bullet in the chest, second
one into the top of the lung.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.559
Death probably instantaneous.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.319
Has the pathologist been?

09:57.320 --> 09:59.679
No, he's probably stuck at some roadblock.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.480
That Resistance shooting
caused a bit of a stink.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.720
Good teeth.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.920
- There's blood in the mouth.
- He probably hit his face when he fell.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.440
What's this?

10:22.520 --> 10:25.199
Cataracts? Was he blind?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.919
I couldn't tell you. They're not
like any cataracts I've seen.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.520
Fine clothes. Not short of money.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.839
Although they could fit better.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.000
Maybe it was an argument with his tailor?

10:43.400 --> 10:45.080
Oooh...!

10:46.080 --> 10:47.920
That's worth a small fortune.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.000
A-hem!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.519
What have you got, Harry?

11:08.520 --> 11:11.639
Eight pounds, three shillings, keys.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.479
Railway ticket, monthly. Return and a half.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.760
From London to Bringle Sands.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.239
Here, Peter Thomas.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.239
ID issued at, er... Kingston Record Office.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.519
Kingston? That's the one the
Resistance burned down.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.320
- Yeah.
- Convenient. Can't be traced.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.439
Care to hazard a time of death, Doctor?

11:45.440 --> 11:49.719
Er... between six and seven this morning.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.799
Harry, would you bag up
these ashes, please?

11:52.800 --> 11:55.360
Yeah. I'll have a word with the neighbours.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.720
Thanks, Doc.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.639
Get your men under control! It's
disgusting what you're doing!

13:16.640 --> 13:18.680
Argh!

13:57.040 --> 13:59.879
Do you come here often with Peter Thomas?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.759
I'm Chief Superintendent Douglas Archer.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.159
And you are... Madam?

14:05.160 --> 14:08.319
Miss. I'd rather not be
mistaken for a madam.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.919
It's Barbara Barga, New York Times.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.559
Have you been in London long?

14:13.560 --> 14:17.359
I arrived ten days ago on the
inaugural Lufthansa flight.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.879
With Goebbels and Goering.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.520
You must be important.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.960
Yet you just walked away
from the scene of a crime.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.400
I saw you.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.319
What is the crime?

14:35.320 --> 14:38.119
Well, from the way you disappeared,
I thought you'd guessed.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.680
The menu, sir.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.279
Foul play. Isn't that what
you call it over here?

14:45.280 --> 14:47.359
You don't seem surprised.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.279
No.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.000
But I hoped it wasn't.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.120
For Peter's sake.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.240
What was it?

15:07.240 --> 15:08.720
Suicide?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.640
He was shot.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.400
Any idea why?

15:19.160 --> 15:21.239
He was what we call a hustler.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.160
Who knows what deals he was into?

15:26.880 --> 15:28.760
And what was your relationship?

15:30.560 --> 15:32.759
He was helping me on a
piece about Americans

15:32.760 --> 15:34.079
who chose to stay in London.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.000
A year of occupation, that kind of thing.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.080
Poor old Peter.

15:42.280 --> 15:45.199
I ran out of film yesterday,
he said he'd get me a roll.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.359
But I guess everything in the apartment

15:47.360 --> 15:48.720
is considered evidence now.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.240
So you walked away to
avoid getting involved.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.719
Didn't do me much good.

15:59.720 --> 16:04.480
Well... that outfit's always
going to get you noticed.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.320
I'm not sure all policemen
would be so observant.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.919
I guess dealers like him will be
rubbing their hands at the thought

16:20.920 --> 16:23.679
of all the new stuff that will come
from the fighting in the North.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.040
You are well-informed.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.480
Funny. I'm not hungry any more.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.600
I'll need to see you again.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.119
Where can I reach you?

16:41.120 --> 16:42.599
The Dorchester.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.199
For some reason, I never got
invited to the reopening.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.160
It's not what it was.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.080
Nothing is.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.039
I don't know.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.000
Some things can improve with age.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.400
What is it?

17:35.920 --> 17:39.280
I've been summoned. In there.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.999
Do you know why?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.400
You tell me.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.800
Danke schon.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.160
- Hi, Doug.
- Harry.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.360
- Sir.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.279
So, what have you been up to?

18:20.280 --> 18:22.519
I'm not entirely sure.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.039
What did you get?

18:25.040 --> 18:27.879
Er... well, according to the neighbours,

18:27.880 --> 18:32.039
Peter Thomas was involved with
some Luftwaffe Feldwebel.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.119
Big guy, spectacles.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.999
Probably from the Quartermaster's
Depot in Marylebone.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.279
Supplied them with all their
goodies for their parties.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.079
You know, drugs, painted ladies.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.159
I'm going to send his description
to the Military Police.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.760
If the Military are
involved, they take over.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.639
Puts us in a spot, doesn't it?

18:53.640 --> 18:56.720
That antique shop, it was
a Resistance safe house.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.640
A transmitter aerial hidden in the ceiling.

19:04.720 --> 19:07.639
Well, if it is Resistance,
that becomes an SS job,

19:07.640 --> 19:09.439
not Military Police.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.920
Either way, it's not our responsibility.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.200
Right. Well, I'll... just send the file.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.760
What do you want to do with these ashes?

19:24.640 --> 19:26.840
We'll keep hold of those for now, I think.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.880
What is it?

19:33.680 --> 19:36.000
That look. I've seen that a thousand times.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.600
What?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.679
A woman, this morning.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.079
Well, she was headed for
Peter Thomas' place,

19:46.080 --> 19:48.639
until she saw the bobbies outside,
then made herself scarce.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.120
Right. Well, let's get
her description, then?

19:53.840 --> 19:55.839
I managed to talk to her.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.359
American. A journalist.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.320
And a liar.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.359
She claims she was after Thomas for film,

20:03.360 --> 20:06.239
but someone like that can get that sort
of stuff easily from the US Embassy,

20:06.240 --> 20:09.119
or the German Press Bureau.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.760
She doesn't need the black market.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.800
Weekly debrief with Kellermann.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.440
Yes, sir, immediately. I
was just on my way up.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.240
Right up my arse.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.679
Superintendent, come in. Come in.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.840
These gentlemen are from The
Signal Magazine in Berlin.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.400
Ja, sehr gut. Er... foto?

20:52.600 --> 20:56.079
Could you and SS-Gruppenfuhrer
Kellermann step behind the table

20:56.080 --> 20:58.120
and look at some notes or a map?

21:00.360 --> 21:03.279
The new flag for the event
with our Russian friends.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.919
Foto.

21:04.920 --> 21:09.719
I think they've made the cross
of St George a little too small?

21:09.720 --> 21:11.600
- Could you point at it?
- Yeah.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.560
Both of you. Please.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.399
Foto.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.279
Superintendent Archer, is it
true here at Scotland Yard,

21:24.280 --> 21:26.600
the men call General Kellermann Father?

21:28.160 --> 21:31.200
Do I not know what goes on in my force?

21:33.160 --> 21:37.199
If Scotland Yard's finest
detective says it is so,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.320
- then who am I to question it?
- So...

21:42.560 --> 21:44.480
Come!

21:50.480 --> 21:52.520
I'm sorry about all that.!

21:55.080 --> 21:56.919
Anything to report?

21:56.920 --> 21:59.359
A murder in Shepherd Market.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.119
Looks like German involvement,

22:01.120 --> 22:05.440
so I expect the Feldgericht der
Luftwaffe will take it over.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.960
Kellermann.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.320
Well...

22:33.840 --> 22:36.799
It seems a senior officer
of the Sicherheitsdienst

22:36.800 --> 22:39.640
will be joining us from Berlin. Today.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.760
- Herr Gruppenfuhrer?
- Glott.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.280
Jawohl, Gruppenfuhrer!

23:05.600 --> 23:07.320
Naturlich.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.199
The reception at The Savoy tonight,

23:17.200 --> 23:19.159
we can make it in his honour.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.959
Standartenfuhrer Dr Huth is on the
personal staff of Reichsfuhrer Himmler.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.240
We want him to feel welcome.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.119
Why is an Intelligence SS
officer coming here, sir?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.440
I don't know.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.639
But, er... fortunately,

23:34.640 --> 23:37.399
you'll be working closely
with Herr Dr Huth,

23:37.400 --> 23:40.920
so his thoughts will not be a
mystery, if you get my meaning.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.240
What did they want?

23:58.320 --> 24:00.800
I've been reassigned. Genealogy.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.279
They want details on all the support staff.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.999
Family histories, bloodlines.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.040
Weed out the undesirables.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.200
I thought...

24:16.400 --> 24:18.959
Well, I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.480
Not so quickly.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.559
Look, I'll go upstairs and
insist you stay working with me.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.040
I thought it was your job
to protect all of us.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.680
You don't get it, do you?

24:38.480 --> 24:39.840
We'll talk tomorrow.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.960
Were you always like this, or was
it her dying that did it to you?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.240
Here.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.319
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr Archer.

25:53.320 --> 25:55.319
Dad! Is it murder?

25:55.320 --> 25:57.519
Murder at the antiques shop,
wasn't it, Mr Archer?

25:57.520 --> 25:59.439
It was in the early edition.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.360
Detective Bob Sheenan.

26:05.680 --> 26:07.679
You like 'em soft, don't you, Mr Archer?

26:07.680 --> 26:09.559
I put one in as soon as I
heard you on the stairs.

26:09.560 --> 26:11.239
I've had my eggs for the week, Mrs Sheenan.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.639
Not to worry, we've got
six from Mrs Custance.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.599
- I don't know how you do it.
- Well, you helped.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.759
I gave her that smelly old sweater
of yours to unravel for wool.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.799
All the eggs are yours, really.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.999
I liked that jumper.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.760
I thought...

26:27.440 --> 26:29.959
Men! You're as bad as my Tom.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.400
- Good day at school, boys?
- Yeah.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.279
Did you behave yourself today, Bob?

26:36.280 --> 26:37.839
Yes, Mr Archer.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.040
Ha-ha-ha-ha! Why don't I believe you?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.759
I've put one spoonful of real tea in it.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.240
- You look like you could use it.
- Thank you.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.399
Well, it was a murder enquiry,

26:51.400 --> 26:54.319
but it doesn't look like
I'm going to be involved.

26:54.320 --> 26:57.759
- Was it a juicy one?
- Douggie!

26:57.760 --> 27:01.000
Key To The Highway by John Lee Hooker.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.960
Dad! Dad! Come and see!

27:37.120 --> 27:39.240
Hurry!

27:44.240 --> 27:45.880
It's a Jaguar!

28:13.440 --> 28:15.200
Na gut.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.280
Yeah. I don't like the look of his liver.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.600
Explain to me.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.479
It's diseased.

29:36.480 --> 29:37.879
It's most interesting.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.999
I... I've never seen one quite like it.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.920
I wonder how your antique
dealer carried on.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.639
How near to death by liver failure was he?

29:47.640 --> 29:52.840
I wouldn't have given him more than...
two months.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.040
What about the eyes?

29:59.360 --> 30:02.319
I saw something like that in the Great War.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.080
Glare from magnesium shells.

30:06.640 --> 30:08.600
Photokeratitis.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.479
I want all his internal organs and his eyes

30:13.480 --> 30:17.759
packed and ready to be flown to
Berlin on the morning flight.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.119
Then there is nothing to keep me.

30:20.120 --> 30:24.359
Sir John, your knowledge and
experience is invaluable.

30:24.360 --> 30:29.439
Please, finish the postmortem so a
report can accompany the remains.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.200
But for now, you will all leave this room.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.840
Except for Inspector Archer.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.960
You were on your way to a party?

31:15.240 --> 31:17.919
There's a reception at The
Savoy in your honour,

31:17.920 --> 31:19.719
Standartenfuhrer Dr Huth.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.240
Kellermann. He has the subtlety of a pig.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.080
What else does he have planned for me?

31:28.800 --> 31:32.319
General Kellermann thought you might like to
see the Houses of Parliament on the way, sir.

31:32.320 --> 31:34.000
As I say, a pig.

31:37.320 --> 31:40.199
Does that mean you would or wouldn't
like to see the Houses of Parliament?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.159
It means, my dear Superintendent,

31:42.160 --> 31:45.279
that I do not have the slightest
intention of spending the evening

31:45.280 --> 31:49.359
watching a roomful of army officers
and their overdressed women

31:49.360 --> 31:53.439
guzzling champagne and, between
mouthfuls of smoked salmon,

31:53.440 --> 31:55.640
telling me the best place
to buy Staffordshire china.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.319
Very well, then, I'll take you to
your accommodation on Brook Street.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.959
You will take me to my office.

32:03.960 --> 32:07.680
And then you will requisition
a car for your permanent use.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.119
As I need you to be
mobile, Inspector Archer.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.360
We are going to be busy, you and I.

32:28.320 --> 32:31.800
In some way, it's a shame the
battle spared such dreary areas.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.079
I'm sorry.

32:35.080 --> 32:37.120
Your wife was killed in one such action.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.919
I'm afraid the blame is
Winston Churchill's.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.720
None of this need have happened.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.360
Well, from what I heard, he paid his debt.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.079
The rumours, the V sign in the
face of the firing squad,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.280
Pure propaganda put out by your Resistance.

32:54.280 --> 32:57.039
So... this Peter Thomas murder...?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.359
Well, it looks like a black-market killing.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.319
A flat full of military cigarettes,

33:01.320 --> 33:03.679
alcohol, petrol coupons.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.039
We already have a statement
from a neighbour

33:06.040 --> 33:08.879
saying that a Luftwaffe Feldwebel
was a frequent visitor.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.040
Yes.

33:13.560 --> 33:17.039
You sent the files to the
Feldgendarmerie straightaway.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.119
And within the hour, the
SS claimed them back

33:19.120 --> 33:21.199
and a teleprinter message from Berlin

33:21.200 --> 33:23.800
instructed the army to pass
all papers back to you.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.959
But that instruction could've only
come from the Supreme Commander.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.320
Heil Hitler.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.239
Of course, you speak excellent German.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.279
You took modern languages at Oxford.
Pembroke.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.320
I was at King's College.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.640
Happy times there.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.200
How long did you resist working for us?

33:54.280 --> 33:57.080
I'm not sure General
Kellermann gave me any choice.

33:59.760 --> 34:02.360
That is the problem with
having a reputation.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.880
You don't think for a minute
it's a black-market murder.

34:10.440 --> 34:13.639
In my experience, the truth doesn't
offer itself up just like that.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.600
No loose ends?

34:18.480 --> 34:21.199
A railway ticket, from Bringle Sands.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.359
It's a resort on the South Coast.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.880
I know exactly where it is.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.319
You are having misgivings
about this investigation.

34:30.320 --> 34:33.438
You got Sir John Shields
to perform the autopsy.

34:33.440 --> 34:36.478
He's the top pathologist in the country.
Physician to His Majesty.

34:36.480 --> 34:38.199
- Your point?
- If you have a strong suspicion

34:38.199 --> 34:41.719
of what Peter Thomas was suffering
from, I ought to be told.

34:45.320 --> 34:47.599
Have you seen anything like this before?

34:47.600 --> 34:49.759
No, but some of my staff have.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.239
They inform me it is far more dangerous

34:52.239 --> 34:54.080
than any Black Death or such.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.600
So it's infectious?

35:00.680 --> 35:02.399
We are fine.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.040
And what caused it?

35:05.640 --> 35:07.959
Something at Bringle Sands?

35:07.960 --> 35:09.800
Quite possibly.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.959
Very nice. Now, get rid
of all this silly junk.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.999
Get lockable filing cases and a metal desk.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.999
Telephones, four direct lines

35:28.000 --> 35:31.199
that do not go through
Kellermann's switchboard.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.199
And I need a table and chair
in the corridor for my sentry.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.959
- Where's my sentry?
- Sentry, sir?

35:36.960 --> 35:39.279
Don't stand there repeating
everything I say.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.399
Get on to the SS guard
commander at Cannon Row,

35:41.400 --> 35:43.559
tell him to send a sentry
and half-a-dozen men

35:43.560 --> 35:45.200
to clear this furniture out.

35:46.320 --> 35:49.159
I doubt there'll be workmen available
at this time of night, sir.

35:49.160 --> 35:52.479
I will be in conference room
number three with Major Steiger.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.719
I expect it all to be done before I return.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.559
And in the morning, I want to see a
team piecing together these ashes

35:58.560 --> 36:00.680
you found in the grate at the murder scene.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.559
Talk about a new broom?

36:11.560 --> 36:13.599
I haven't seen this much activity

36:13.600 --> 36:15.280
since the night the invasion started.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.360
Four new lines, tested and functioning.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.399
Are you all right?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.359
Well...

36:29.360 --> 36:32.759
Sylvia, she, er... she's gone and done it.

36:32.760 --> 36:37.119
She... she walked out and grabbed
a handful of blank SIPO passes,

36:37.120 --> 36:38.840
from what it looks like.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.000
She's got herself on the list.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.079
Damn it!

36:46.080 --> 36:47.400
Yeah.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.119
Standartenfuhrer Huth's office.

36:59.120 --> 37:03.239
Archer. Splendid. Is the
Standartenfuhrer with you?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.519
He's in number three conference room, sir.

37:05.520 --> 37:07.199
Unfortunately, he's left orders

37:07.200 --> 37:09.519
that no calls should be
put through to him there.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.439
That doesn't apply to me, of course,

37:11.440 --> 37:13.919
but there appears to be something wrong

37:13.920 --> 37:15.639
with the phone in the conference room.

37:15.640 --> 37:18.719
That's probably because the Signals
staff are changing the lines, sir.

37:18.720 --> 37:21.199
What? At this time of night?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.999
Changing phones in my office?

37:23.000 --> 37:25.319
Standartenfuhrer Huth's
a very busy man, sir.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.279
Which is why he never arrived at The Savoy.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.799
Achtung!

37:28.800 --> 37:30.439
Archer?

37:30.440 --> 37:31.599
Alle raus, bitte.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.719
Should I come over there now?

37:33.720 --> 37:36.720
Standartenfuhrer has just walked in, sir.

37:55.960 --> 38:00.080
Do not discuss the workings of
this office with outsiders.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.639
- It was General Kellermann, sir.
- How do you know?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.479
I'm reliably informed
your drunken friend here

38:07.480 --> 38:09.919
can manage a fairly convincing imitation

38:09.920 --> 38:12.479
of General Kellermann's
English, for instance.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.479
The Peter Thomas murder investigation
is part of an operation

38:15.480 --> 38:18.719
we have codenamed
Schlussene, the Final Act.

38:18.720 --> 38:22.239
I shall be notified of all arrests
in connection with this case

38:22.240 --> 38:26.879
and no information goes outside this
room without my written permission,

38:26.880 --> 38:30.119
or that of Reichsfuhrer
Heinrich Himmler. Clear?

38:30.120 --> 38:31.719
Unforgettably so, sir.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.759
Any breach of this instruction

38:33.760 --> 38:37.159
is not only a capital
offence under Section 134

38:37.160 --> 38:39.919
of the Military Orders of the
Commander-in-Chief Great Britain,

38:39.920 --> 38:41.879
for which the penalty is a firing squad,

38:41.880 --> 38:45.519
but also under Section 11 of
your own Emergency Powers

38:45.520 --> 38:47.599
German Occupation Act 1941,

38:47.600 --> 38:49.680
for which they hang offenders
at Wandsworth Prison.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.760
Would the hanging or the
shooting come first, sir?

38:56.880 --> 39:00.560
We must always leave something for
the jury to decide. Gentlemen.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.239
- Morning.
- Dad! Was it an all-night party?

39:21.240 --> 39:22.800
If only.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.999
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.319
- Thank you.
- I'll make something for you.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.159
No, I'm fine.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.279
Boys... I've got a car.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.759
So I'm going to take you
to school in half an hour.

39:35.760 --> 39:38.039
- Is it the Jaguar?
- No, it's not.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.559
You're not going back there without a rest?

39:40.560 --> 39:42.440
I'm just getting my second wind.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.080
The bathwater's still warm.
Only the children have used it.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.399
Woman down the street saw an
ambulance train going south

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
through Clapham Junction Monday.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.319
It was full of wounded German soldiers.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.239
Two Red Cross coaches on the back.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.999
I'd be careful who you
tell that to, Mrs Sheenan.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.840
I wouldn't tell anyone, that block
warden might hear about it.

40:15.120 --> 40:16.760
But I can talk to you, Mr Archer.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.039
Well, in the towns,

40:21.040 --> 40:24.559
it's just the odd murder here
and there of German soldiers.

40:24.560 --> 40:27.719
But in the country, there are bigger groups

40:27.720 --> 40:31.160
ambushing whole German patrols.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.400
So, the fighting's not over?
There's still a chance?

40:40.120 --> 40:42.520
Well, I'm afraid the winter's coming.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.279
You mean the cold will get them?

40:46.280 --> 40:49.040
Well, they can't light
fires for fear of smoke.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.080
There'll be no leaves left, so no cover.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.080
Spotter planes will have it easy.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.919
I think that'll be it for the Resistance.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.279
Except maybe in the north,
in the unoccupied zone.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.559
Yeah, they say it's bad up there.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.160
Shortages.

41:07.360 --> 41:09.040
Those poor boys!

41:15.560 --> 41:17.600
You think I'll ever see my Tom again?

41:19.320 --> 41:21.000
I don't know what to tell Bob.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.599
The Germans have promised to return
all POWs as soon as possible.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.200
What do the Germans care?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.599
They're getting cheap labour.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.880
What can our government offer in exchange?

41:43.280 --> 41:46.080
Give it time, Mrs Sheenan.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.280
You mustn't let Bob see you unhappy.

41:54.960 --> 41:58.120
The POW camps are more comfortable
than the internment ones.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.320
I know that's not much consolation.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.159
Dad...

42:23.160 --> 42:25.160
Do you work for the Gestapo?

42:28.640 --> 42:30.200
No.

42:31.800 --> 42:34.919
I'm a detective with the
Metropolitan Police. You know that.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.959
The Gestapo are at Scotland Yard.

42:36.960 --> 42:38.639
They're in the building next door.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.080
And they're mostly all Germans.

42:42.440 --> 42:44.160
But you work with the Gestapo?

42:45.560 --> 42:47.039
Is that what you've heard?

42:47.040 --> 42:48.680
The boys at school said so.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.400
I don't.

42:55.720 --> 42:59.519
Dad... me and some of the boys
at school were wondering,

42:59.520 --> 43:01.560
could you get a Gestapo badge?

43:04.400 --> 43:06.599
The Gestapo don't have badges, Douggie.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.440
They use identity tags.

43:09.640 --> 43:12.639
Well, could you get one of the SS armbands?

43:12.640 --> 43:15.119
Or one of the silver-wire SD badges?

43:15.120 --> 43:17.440
Yeah. No-one at school's got one of them.

43:23.040 --> 43:26.080
Boys... one day, the Germans will be gone.

43:27.720 --> 43:29.359
And we'll carry on

43:29.360 --> 43:33.800
and get back to the way we
were and how things were.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.879
If we let things fall apart now

43:40.880 --> 43:44.799
because they're here, then
it's going to be difficult

43:44.800 --> 43:47.040
or impossible to get back there.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.680
The law is all we have.

43:53.120 --> 43:56.120
And, quite frankly... I'm it.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.440
- Doug.
- Sylvia!

44:39.520 --> 44:42.359
You shouldn't be anywhere near here.
Are you mad?

44:42.360 --> 44:45.160
Don't you know Whitehall has
regular Gendarmerie patrols?

44:48.720 --> 44:50.039
When you stole those passes,

44:50.040 --> 44:52.560
you ended up on every Gestapo
list in the occupied zone.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.959
Christ! It's not for you,
it's for The Mall shooting.

45:00.960 --> 45:02.999
Argh!

45:03.000 --> 45:04.319
- There's a side door.
- No!

45:04.320 --> 45:07.360
They'll have plain-clothes men watching
for anyone acting suspiciously.

45:10.080 --> 45:11.720
What the hell are you doing?!

45:15.720 --> 45:17.360
Herr Unteroffizier?

45:24.240 --> 45:25.959
What are you doing?

45:25.960 --> 45:28.240
You're hurting my wrist,
you bloody bastard!

45:45.760 --> 45:48.360
- Danke.
- Bitte. Next!

45:57.600 --> 45:59.519
The Germans view those SIPO passes you took

45:59.520 --> 46:02.959
as just about the most valuable piece
of paper a foreigner can be given.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.839
A foreigner?!

46:04.840 --> 46:06.679
- That's not how I meant it.
- Yes, it is.

46:06.680 --> 46:09.199
That's what we are, as far as
you're concerned - foreigners.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.279
The Germans are the ones
with the right to be here

46:11.280 --> 46:13.799
and we're the intruders who
have to bow and bloody scrape.

46:13.800 --> 46:16.360
- Calm down!
- Get your hands off me, you bloody Gestapo bastard!

46:19.280 --> 46:22.199
- Have you been drinking?
- So what? - Sylvia!

46:22.200 --> 46:26.839
Look at you. You're pathetic!

46:26.840 --> 46:29.519
I've got friends who don't go in
fear and trembling of the hunt.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.759
You wouldn't understand that, would you?

46:31.760 --> 46:35.120
No. Too busy doing their
dirty work for them.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.320
I'm a bloody fool for not having guessed.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.839
You're Resistance.

46:43.840 --> 46:46.039
Why are you here?

46:46.040 --> 46:49.399
And what have we been
doing these past months?

46:49.400 --> 46:52.119
Lucky old me, it's not
your job to hunt us down.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.719
- Not yet, anyway.
- What do you want, Sylvia?

46:54.720 --> 46:56.759
Have you run out of information to hand on?

46:56.760 --> 46:58.519
Well, we both got something, didn't we?

46:58.520 --> 47:00.760
You didn't answer my question.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.319
Maybe I wanted to tell you you
needed to be more careful.

47:09.320 --> 47:12.399
There are some a lot
more determined than me.

47:12.400 --> 47:14.079
I don't doubt that.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.319
They'd do anything to make
people like you cooperate.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.679
- I've said enough.
- What do you mean?

47:19.680 --> 47:21.439
- Just leave me alone!
- What are they going to do?

47:21.440 --> 47:23.479
- I don't know!
- Who are they?!

47:23.480 --> 47:25.999
Heroes, not collaborators, like you lot!

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
I'm doing this for all
of us, you bloody fool!

47:35.160 --> 47:36.960
Give me a name.

47:40.040 --> 47:41.719
John.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.400
I don't know his surname.

47:44.480 --> 47:47.119
He comes and goes, he always
has a different scheme.

47:47.120 --> 47:48.599
Now it's you.

47:48.600 --> 47:51.200
Me? Where can I find him?

47:54.160 --> 47:55.600
Where?

47:58.120 --> 48:00.600
The Coach And Horses, Hammersmith.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.199
They say he took out a
Panzer with a tyre iron.

48:05.200 --> 48:06.640
Cost him his arm.

48:08.240 --> 48:10.079
If you've only just guessed about me,

48:10.080 --> 48:12.160
I suppose you haven't twigged to Harry yet.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.639
Morning, Jimmy. Busy?

49:02.640 --> 49:06.359
All these bloomin' arrangements
for the friendship ceremony

49:06.360 --> 49:08.840
between them and the Russkies.

49:10.120 --> 49:12.440
Maybe it's a good thing
I'm borrowing you, then.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.880
Great. Plain clothes?

49:17.200 --> 49:18.599
Get changed.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.919
Yeah, well, I keep my old suit
in the locker since last time.

49:21.920 --> 49:23.960
Good. I'll walk with you.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.519
I need you to check on someone.

49:31.520 --> 49:32.960
A character called John.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.599
He's a regular at The Coach And Horses.

49:39.600 --> 49:42.400
Upper Mall, Hammersmith. Missing an arm.

49:43.960 --> 49:46.440
I would do it myself, but
I think he knows me.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.159
This isn't strictly police business.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.959
He may be Resistance.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.800
So I understand if you don't want to do it.

50:00.520 --> 50:03.279
If you think it needs to
be done, sir, I'm in.

50:03.280 --> 50:09.760
Good. Draw a pistol and keep
your wits about you. All right?

50:40.240 --> 50:41.720
Anything wrong, Super?

50:46.560 --> 50:48.200
I ran into Sylvia.

50:50.880 --> 50:53.760
Christ! Is she all right?

50:57.880 --> 51:00.840
Of course, you knew she was
Resistance, didn't you?

51:02.120 --> 51:04.200
Just like you know everything else.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.679
Well, you can hardly blame her.

51:08.680 --> 51:10.880
Having your parents killed like that.

51:20.680 --> 51:24.799
I, er... did some digging.

51:24.800 --> 51:28.639
That American dame, seems
to be who she says.

51:28.640 --> 51:31.680
Barbara Barga has quite a reputation.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.760
Do you think she could be Resistance, too?

51:37.200 --> 51:38.440
It seems everyone is.

51:39.960 --> 51:42.840
A Yank? Why would she get involved?

51:44.120 --> 51:45.920
I don't know.

51:47.040 --> 51:49.040
But she had a rendezvous
at that safe house.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.119
Are you sure you're not
talking yourself around

51:53.120 --> 51:55.360
so you can go and see her again?

52:11.960 --> 52:13.559
Archer.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.759
Sir, a barman gave me information.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.559
He's called John Spode.

52:18.560 --> 52:20.199
I've got the address.

52:20.200 --> 52:21.879
Well done. Where?

52:21.880 --> 52:23.879
Peveril Lane, Hammersmith.

52:23.880 --> 52:27.160
I've gained access with a bit of
force, if you know what I mean.

52:28.280 --> 52:29.920
All right.

53:37.160 --> 53:38.960
This was hidden.

54:00.800 --> 54:02.640
A team of scientists.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.960
That must be our man - John Spode.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.680
And that's our dead man
from Shepherd Market.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.280
William Spode.

54:25.200 --> 54:26.399
Brothers.

54:26.400 --> 54:28.520
- Check on those scientists in the picture.
- Will do.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.479
That from the Peter Thomas shooting?

55:13.480 --> 55:16.160
The William Spode shooting,
we can call it now.

55:17.520 --> 55:20.399
I'll bet there's no such
person as Peter Thomas.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.360
And this places his younger
brother at the shooting.

55:26.760 --> 55:28.680
My guess is he'll be back for this.

55:29.920 --> 55:31.640
So he killed his own brother?

55:34.000 --> 55:35.880
It's hard to imagine.

55:37.360 --> 55:38.960
Perhaps.

55:40.520 --> 55:43.560
Find out the part number and
how to get a replacement.

55:46.960 --> 55:48.799
Letter from a school,

55:48.800 --> 55:51.919
confirming position of
assistant music teacher.

55:51.920 --> 55:53.559
Beech Road!

55:53.560 --> 55:55.680
- What is it, sir?
- That's my son's school.

55:57.040 --> 55:59.479
He's after Douggie!

55:59.480 --> 56:02.959
Call Central! Get them to put a watch put
on this place in case he comes back!

56:02.960 --> 56:06.159
- Why would he want your son, sir?
- John Spode's Resistance.

56:06.160 --> 56:08.719
They want to control me and
get to me through my son.

56:08.720 --> 56:10.320
What else could it be?

56:11.840 --> 56:13.480
Call Harry Woods!

56:53.800 --> 56:56.679
- Douggie would have been safe with me.
- How the hell do you know?!

56:56.680 --> 56:58.639
Schlussene, the Final Act.

56:58.640 --> 57:02.079
It would have the ability
to wipe out an entire city.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.960
Don't go home without me, will you?

57:05.760 --> 57:09.239
We need nothing of you, except
loyalty to your country.

57:09.240 --> 57:11.239
We all of us have to take risks, Douglas.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.559
We've taken one by telling
you as much as we have.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.239
Don't go back there and say no deal.

57:15.240 --> 57:17.439
- What if I did?
- Then they'd kill you.

57:17.440 --> 57:19.959
You know too much now to be
allowed to stay uncommitted.

57:19.960 --> 57:22.559
I'm going to give you a
lesson you will never forget.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.639
I'm worried about you, Doug.
Being Huth's man.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.639
It doesn't look good to some people.

57:27.640 --> 57:30.240
Don't turn your back,
man, this is your doing.
