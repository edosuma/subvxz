WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.002
-Aaah!
-Yaah!
-Huh.

00:02.036 --> 00:03.104
-Duh!
-Uh!
-Oh!

00:03.204 --> 00:05.673
-Aaah!
-(screams)
-(high-pitched note)

00:05.706 --> 00:09.210
All new Sunny.
Wednesday, September 25 on FXX.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.778
(high-pitched note
continues, stops)

00:12.012 --> 00:13.114
(motors revving)

00:13.214 --> 00:16.784
ANNOUNCER: FX presents Mayans.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.254
- Previously on
"Mayans M.C."...

00:20.288 --> 00:21.589
- It's Mini.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.557
- Hola?
Mini?

00:23.591 --> 00:24.992
- She was watching
from the rocks

00:25.025 --> 00:26.160
on a sat phone.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.666
- Three of my best men dead.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.703
- That's a very dangerous
12-year-old kid.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.505
- You have to take her
to Dr. Cayman.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.839
She's getting worse.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.641
- We don't know that.

00:42.710 --> 00:43.944
- Who's the old man?

00:43.977 --> 00:45.279
- Felipe?

00:45.313 --> 00:47.615
It's EZ and Angel's pop.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.250
- His sons are Mayans?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.119
- Yeah.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.186
- I know it's a lot,

00:52.220 --> 00:53.187
and I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't--

00:53.221 --> 00:55.556
- I know.
A family thing.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.890
Having me run
background checks,

00:56.924 --> 00:59.193
pull local estate records...

00:59.227 --> 01:01.061
don't make me part of something
I'm gonna regret, EZ.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.196
- It's done.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.698
The golden boy is
free and clear.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.767
You can help him pack his shit
in the morning.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.801
- Angel!

01:07.835 --> 01:08.902
- They reached out at all?

01:08.936 --> 01:09.970
- Not a word.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.605
Almost eight months.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.274
- This shit with you
and Angel,

01:13.307 --> 01:14.642
it's gone on too long.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.610
I don't care how you do it.
Work it the fuck out.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.611
Now.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.646
- We have to talk, Angel.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.348
It's about Mom.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.584
I know who killed her.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.661
- So you--you just been
living with this?

01:35.963 --> 01:38.832
- How the fuck was
I supposed to tell you?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.270
It's the first time
in eight months

01:42.303 --> 01:43.504
you looked me in the eye.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.509
- Yeah, I get that.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.615
So Pops know anything
about this?

01:54.648 --> 01:56.717
- No.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.658
Why you telling me now, man?

02:19.072 --> 02:21.309
When everything unraveled
with Potter...

02:24.378 --> 02:25.813
I know I betrayed you.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.950
I know staying here
in the club,

02:29.983 --> 02:32.553
it kept that wound fresh.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.726
The life everyone thought I was
supposed to have,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.494
the one I thought
I fucked up...

02:43.431 --> 02:45.032
None of that was real.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.071
I'm not the golden boy, Angel.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.744
I stayed because I was
afraid to leave.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.251
You and Pop...

03:05.519 --> 03:08.356
It's the only thing in my life
I know is real.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.027
And the club.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.302
I need to be
a part of something.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.639
- You didn't answer
my question.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.710
- I can't lose you, Angel.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.047
- And this is the tie
that binds.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.256
You know, most people would
either put a bullet in his head

03:42.290 --> 03:44.425
or walked away from this,
but this--

03:44.458 --> 03:47.961
bro, this is fucking nuts.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.564
You got arrest records,

03:50.598 --> 03:52.866
family history,
timelines--

03:52.900 --> 03:56.404
Jesus Christ, you did a fucking
psychological profile on him.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.739
- Had to do something.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.243
I know proof isn't
what I know I saw.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.814
Couldn't take it to the cops.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.784
M.C.'s relationship
with SAMCRO.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.756
Couldn't take it to Bishop.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.025
- And that look in your eye,
brother...

04:21.161 --> 04:24.965
It's the same look you had
nine years ago.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.868
Put you in this whole
fucking mess.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.539
- I don't know how
to do this.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.777
- You're not gonna let it go
until you do.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.681
Till it's finished.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.955
And now...

04:47.988 --> 04:49.990
neither will I.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.518
- * Mother of exiles

05:50.551 --> 05:52.686
* The torch of hope

05:52.720 --> 05:55.322
* In the toss of the tempest

05:55.355 --> 05:58.191
* Threw us Madison's rope

05:58.225 --> 06:01.328
* But the brazen giant

06:01.361 --> 06:04.197
* With limbs astride

06:04.231 --> 06:06.767
* Blocks the golden door

06:06.800 --> 06:10.771
* To the U.S. of Lies

06:10.804 --> 06:14.408
* Damn your huddled masses

06:14.442 --> 06:17.778
* Scrub our floors

06:17.811 --> 06:20.414
* Cut our grasses

06:20.448 --> 06:23.016
* I am a wolf

06:23.050 --> 06:25.886
* A wild cur

06:25.919 --> 06:28.956
* Cut from the pack

06:28.989 --> 06:31.725
* With blood on my fur

06:31.759 --> 06:34.361
* And every howl

06:34.394 --> 06:37.130
* Marks a debt

06:37.164 --> 06:40.734
* 'Cause a beaten dog

06:42.135 --> 06:44.472
* Never forgets

06:46.173 --> 06:49.710
* Every howl marks a debt

06:51.344 --> 06:55.215
* 'Cause a beaten dog

06:55.248 --> 06:58.486
* Never forgets

07:01.522 --> 07:04.658
* Never forgets

07:22.375 --> 07:23.944
- Everything good?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.648
- Yeah, I guess.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.949
Where's Gilly?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.784
- The Creep's
on a scrap run.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.185
Yuma.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.921
- She doing okay?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.689
- Yeah.
She's upstairs.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.407
- Rode here together.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.745
- That's a good sign.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.881
- We're working shit out.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.482
- Glad to hear that, son.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.687
- I got a letter
from Corrections.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.221
Stockton PO.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.458
Have to...
clean up some parole paperwork.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.961
Discharge shit.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.897
Angel said he'd ride up
with me.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.332
- Lot of patches
north of Berdoo.

08:19.366 --> 08:21.168
Should take Coco
and Gilly with.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.673
- I was thinking maybe
we'd go up alone.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.474
Eight-hour ride...

08:27.507 --> 08:29.810
give us a chance
to keep talking.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.646
- Yeah.
Makes sense.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.648
- Stay off the 10.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.917
Still haven't cleaned up
our Samoan problem.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.752
- Right.

08:38.786 --> 08:41.254
- I'll make
the ride-through calls.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.423
- The clubhouse will be
your first stop in Stockton.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.992
We'll let Ramos
know you're coming.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.594
He'll sort you out.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.763
- Okay.
Thanks.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.100
- Eat.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.248
- Settling in?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.619
- I suppose.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.156
- Can't be any worse
than living out of a tent.

09:17.725 --> 09:21.261
- At least I could see
the danger out in the desert.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.130
Here?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.532
I need a black light

09:25.565 --> 09:27.034
to find the things
that can kill me.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.471
It's just until
the merc heat is off.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.340
- I know.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.481
She's busy today.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.283
Lots of kicks.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.821
- That's 'cause he...

09:47.855 --> 09:49.589
wants Mom to relax.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
She's doing too much.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.635
- What is it?

10:15.515 --> 10:16.950
I know you have your reasons

10:16.984 --> 10:18.618
for keeping things
on the down-low

10:18.652 --> 10:20.020
about all this.

10:22.723 --> 10:27.661
But I'd at least like to tell
my family I'm having a kid.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.063
- The family you've completely
shut out?

10:31.564 --> 10:34.434
You haven't talked
to your father in months.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.137
And every time I ask you
what's going on with EZ,

10:37.170 --> 10:38.939
you tell me it's historical.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.107
- Oh, come on, querida.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.977
You--your whole life
is a fucking closed book.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.113
I tell you
just about everything.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.181
Most of it you don't even
want to hear.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.251
You hardly tell me anything.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.923
- And that's why we're perfect
for each other.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.829
Let's wait until she's born
and we're all safe,

11:01.862 --> 11:04.364
and then you can tell
the club, your family,

11:04.397 --> 11:06.599
and the whole world can know.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.669
- Like I have a choice.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.544
Gotta head up north
for a couple days.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.779
Help my brother out.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.850
Historical shit.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.085
Will be around
if you need anything.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.119
- Okay.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.991
Um, I'm worried
about Mini.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.894
She's not going
to handle this well.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.696
We haven't been separated
since I found her.

11:37.731 --> 11:38.899
- The club's headed
to the farmhouse

11:38.932 --> 11:39.900
to help with the move.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.735
I'll have Coco
keep an eye on her.

11:41.769 --> 11:42.770
- Thank you.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.759
- Sí.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.668
- Okay.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.448
- So busy.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.255
- Hope everything goes well
with Dr. Cayman.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.157
See you when you get home.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.025
- Yes.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.961
- Be right back.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.834
- Estas bien?
- Yes, perfecto.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.369
- Let me know
if you need anything.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.470
- I'll be fine.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.972
I just want to break ground
already.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.307
It feels like we've been
working on this forever.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.442
- Yeah, I know.
And we will.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.944
- Mm-hmm.
- I love you.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.679
- I love you.

13:32.712 --> 13:34.514
Oh, and good luck.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.385
- Yeah.
- Hey.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.221
Maybe Dr. Cayman can
convince her to see a shrink.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.690
- Maybe.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.068
- There you are, señora.
Gracias.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.870
- A usted.

14:01.374 --> 14:03.043
- You finish "Native Son"?

14:03.076 --> 14:05.378
- Yeah, it was good.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.746
Heavy.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.249
I think I like "Wilderness"

14:09.282 --> 14:11.718
and "Go Tell It
on the Mountain" better.

14:11.751 --> 14:12.986
- Fiction.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.656
Makes all that shit
a little more palatable.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.191
- Truth I know.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.728
- You on the road?
- Yeah.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.530
Headed to Stockton.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.065
- M.C.?

14:25.098 --> 14:26.666
- Mostly.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.640
We talked.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.145
- Good.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.130
- Pops.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.167
- Good to see you, son.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.105
Travel safe.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.283
- The fuck you grinning about?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.917
- No reason.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.472
- Iliana.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.008
- Emily.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.175
How are you, sweet girl?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.144
- I'm good, I'm good.
How are things here?

15:44.177 --> 15:46.079
- Still catching up.
Getting there.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.148
Getting settled in
at the new place?

15:48.181 --> 15:51.418
- Mm, as settled
as we'll ever be, I guess.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.653
- I was hoping I would
see you on Sunday.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.722
I had lunch
with your mother.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.694
- I didn't know
Diana was in town.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.431
- Shit.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.267
I'm sorry.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.137
Are things still...
- They are what they are.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.140
- Agricultural park proposal?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.975
- Yes, finally.
- Wonderful.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.211
Okay, just give everything
to Marlin,

16:18.245 --> 16:20.313
and he'll walk you
through the process.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.715
I have to go.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.617
It's really good to see you.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.320
- You too.

16:27.354 --> 16:31.024
Sorry--Iliana, what--
what process?

16:31.058 --> 16:33.226
Why do I have to be
walked through anything?

16:33.260 --> 16:35.795
- It's a projected calendar
for the review.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.896
There's already six bids,

16:36.929 --> 16:39.166
and there's another week
before the deadline.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.900
Just want to let people know
that it's not gonna be

16:40.933 --> 16:43.503
a quick turnaround.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.073
- There are six fuckin' bids?!

16:46.106 --> 16:47.140
- Keep your voice down.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.808
- When were you gonna tell us

16:48.841 --> 16:50.477
that we had competition
for the agri-park?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.045
- Well, if you came
to the town council meeting,

16:52.079 --> 16:53.046
then you would have known.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.547
- Oh, fuck that!

16:54.581 --> 16:56.883
- We are barely
back on our feet here.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.886
This town has been off the grid
for over two months.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.354
Not a dime of aid.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.223
$70 billion on a fucking wall,

17:03.256 --> 17:04.424
but half a mile away,

17:04.457 --> 17:05.425
we can't even keep
the lights on.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.726
- What does that have to do

17:06.759 --> 17:08.027
with the other bids?

17:08.061 --> 17:09.529
- The EPA rules,

17:09.562 --> 17:10.997
the ones that
miraculously changed

17:11.030 --> 17:13.032
to accommodate your husband--

17:13.066 --> 17:14.834
that didn't stay a secret.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.404
The fire gave others time
to put in competitive bids.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.939
You didn't think big agri
would come knocking?

17:19.972 --> 17:21.508
- Well, we thought
you'd protect us.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.043
We had a professional
understanding.

17:24.077 --> 17:25.778
- I'm the fucking mayor, Emily.

17:25.812 --> 17:28.748
I am not Santo Padre's
cartel boss.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.585
Look, things like this,

17:32.619 --> 17:34.587
I have to answer
to a comptroller,

17:34.621 --> 17:36.389
city planner,
town council--

17:36.423 --> 17:39.459
- Well, there wouldn't be
things like this

17:39.492 --> 17:43.062
if it wasn't for my husband.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.099
So answering to him
should be your only concern.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.761
- What's going on?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.497
- The kid, Mini's, missing.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.498
Looks like she ran away.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.699
- When?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.201
- Maybe an hour ago.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.868
Must have slipped out
the back.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.437
- Adelita was worried
about that.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.539
- Mini hasn't been right
since the thing with the mercs.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.707
Blames herself.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.842
- Does the kid know where
Adelita is?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.477
- Just that she's over
the border.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.479
- Might try to find her.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.780
- She's headed north.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.217
Closest town will take her
about two hours on foot.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.285
- We'll head out there.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.653
Have your people
comb the woods, huh?

19:13.686 --> 19:15.322
- Might need a picture.

19:15.355 --> 19:18.024
- We're printing something up.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.670
- And her?

19:35.875 --> 19:38.077
- Gracias.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.935
- What's that?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.304
- Happy.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.072
He's got a small house
outside of Charming.

20:40.106 --> 20:43.376
Freeway access
less than a half-mile.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.545
- What do you think we're gonna
do when we get there?

20:45.578 --> 20:46.913
Ring his doorbell?

20:46.946 --> 20:50.249
Take him out for coffee?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.285
- What are we gonna do?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.722
- You trust me?
- Of course.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.329
- You know this crew?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.096
- Fuck no.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.934
- Mayans.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.003
Santo Padre.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.009
We didn't get
a courtesy call.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.311
You're riding through
our territory.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.812
- Since when?

21:19.846 --> 21:21.414
- We're on the state highway,
man.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.849
- Not anymore.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.051
- Just getting gas and smokes.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.821
- Don't bother lighting that.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.122
You're not staying.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.795
Why don't get you get back
on your cholo chops

21:35.828 --> 21:37.296
and get out of here?

21:37.330 --> 21:39.298
The next time,
make a call.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.334
Comprende?

21:46.172 --> 21:47.273
- Yeah, we get it.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.309
Next time we call
the Slow Boys.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.014
- The fuck you just say?

21:55.047 --> 21:56.282
- Sorry, he's just picking up

21:56.315 --> 21:59.018
a lack of cognitive energy
coming our way.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.720
- What?

22:00.753 --> 22:02.188
- Exactly.

22:05.858 --> 22:07.727
- You poser fucking douchebags.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.562
You guys watch some
bullshit TV show

22:09.596 --> 22:12.632
and think a vest and two wheels
makes you a club.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.066
Hm.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.670
Guessing Brad and Todd here

22:17.704 --> 22:19.472
got all their totally awesome
gym bros

22:19.506 --> 22:21.674
filling up their fucking table.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.142
- Yeah.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.211
At the little monkey clubhouse
in their mom's basement.

22:25.244 --> 22:27.079
- You don't know what--
- Shut the fuck up!

22:27.113 --> 22:30.883
Jesus, man,
you guys are an embarrassment.

22:30.917 --> 22:34.454
Now go climb on your homocycles
and get the fuck out of here.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.235
- I can see those Tony Robbins
seminars are really paying off.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.170
- Man, fuck Tony.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.039
Fuck his gigantic head.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.941
- Yup.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.190
- The Arcade!
Let's go!

23:11.223 --> 23:12.625
- Seriously?

23:12.659 --> 23:16.028
- We got all day,
little brother.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.865
The ride's the only part
that's never complicated.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.767
Gotta make that shit last.

23:22.234 --> 23:25.605
Unless you're afraid
I'll kick your ass.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.440
- Loser pays.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.596
Mi amor, te como fue?

23:49.629 --> 23:51.798
- Peña fucked us.

23:51.831 --> 23:52.832
- What?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.137
Stay here.
Wait for my mother.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.138
Have Paco bring the car.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.339
- What's going on?

24:00.372 --> 24:01.440
- Not sure.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.842
I'll be with Emily.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.349
Bitch.

24:10.382 --> 24:12.885
- Remember Dad working
in Del Monte?

24:16.155 --> 24:17.657
- Sort of.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.527
I remember the day Pops
opened up the shop.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.294
- Me too.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.930
He was so happy.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.933
- Eh, I don't know if Felipe's
ever been happy.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.835
- Growin' up in Sonora,

24:28.868 --> 24:30.703
dirt fuckin' poor,

24:30.737 --> 24:32.639
Pop had a rough life
before he got here.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.842
- We'll never know anything
about that,

24:35.875 --> 24:38.477
'cause our old man
don't tell us shit.

24:39.345 --> 24:43.382
Talks to that jar of ashes more
than his own two fuckin' sons.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.693
- Loser.

25:06.238 --> 25:07.707
- Gracias.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.331
- Any luck?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.399
- No. You?

25:33.432 --> 25:34.734
- Nothing.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.869
Checked the bodegas,
lavandería, the post office,

25:36.903 --> 25:40.607
and for some reason a bar
full of local whores.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.074
- If I was 12,
that's where I'd be.

25:43.475 --> 25:45.878
-  No one's seen her
at the open market.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.280
Knocked on a few homes
as well.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.249
- All right,
let's finish up, huh?

25:51.651 --> 25:52.852
- Shit.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.787
Mercs on your six.

25:54.821 --> 25:55.988
Hey.

26:01.493 --> 26:02.862
- Looking for Adelita?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.563
- Well, they're not here
for spring break.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.633
- Maybe we tell 'em
we're here to help.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.902
- Seeing us will create
more questions than answers.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.738
Stay out of sight.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.573
Uh...

26:14.607 --> 26:16.709
- Taza, you and Hank
take point.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.477
- Got it.
- Go.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.290
- Choke!
- Shit.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.093
Choke!

26:35.695 --> 26:37.463
- There is no hole.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.933
There is no hole.

26:40.967 --> 26:45.972
- Boom, mothafucka!

26:46.005 --> 26:48.675
I am a golden god!
Fear me.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.777
- Congrats, you're
a mini golf pro.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.344
- You should be
proud of yourself.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.180
- I am unfuckingstoppable.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.248
- Hey, it's me...

26:56.282 --> 26:58.350
- I'll have Rita reach out
to Dr. Luna,

26:58.384 --> 27:00.252
schedule a time for you
to meet.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.988
I think you'll really like her.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.489
- Dr. Cayman's office.

27:03.522 --> 27:04.757
Can I put you on a brief hold?

27:04.791 --> 27:06.358
- I know it's what Miguel
and Emily want.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.928
- We all want you
to get better, Dita.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.997
- Yes.
Thank you, doctor.

27:11.030 --> 27:14.366
- Dr. Cayman's office.

27:37.189 --> 27:38.557
- You sure you know how
to put it in the hole?

27:43.930 --> 27:46.332
- Sounds like a lot
of bikes.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.867
- Yes, it does.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.672
That's a lot of white guys
on steroids.

27:53.706 --> 27:56.709
- Yeah.
They seem kind of pissed.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.712
- So what's the plan?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.781
- Just stay cool.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.421
- He keeps the gun
in the bedroll.

28:11.858 --> 28:12.992
- I understand you had
something to say

28:13.025 --> 28:15.327
about our club.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.331
- Yeah, sorry about that.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.367
Just trying to impress
the prospect.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.869
- We're going to impress
something else.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.203
- Go.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.437
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit!

28:31.543 --> 28:34.580
- Crazy shit!

28:34.613 --> 28:35.848
- Screw you!

28:35.882 --> 28:37.216
- Yeah, pretty fuckin' tough
with a gun.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.951
- Yeah, that's why I carry one.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.891
- What the fuck?!

28:46.058 --> 28:48.660
- Come on, come on!

29:19.591 --> 29:20.927
- He's on your right.

29:29.802 --> 29:32.004
- Shit.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.080
- Got to settle our shit
another time!

29:41.113 --> 29:44.250
Patches over badges, always!

29:44.283 --> 29:47.353
- Yeah, but this shit
ain't over.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.029
They're on the move.

30:47.613 --> 30:48.881
- Gracias.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.560
- If the kid's here,
mercs didn't find her.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.595
Maybe she found
a place to hide.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.332
- Well, if she's hiding,
we ain't gonna find her either.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.567
- Call Pablo.
Let him know.

31:13.572 --> 31:14.840
- We gotta tell Adelita.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.508
She might know
where the kid would go.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.544
- Yeah, I'll call Vic.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.613
- Gun, gun!

31:22.949 --> 31:24.583
Put it down!

31:27.786 --> 31:29.956
- Whoa.
- Shit.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.418
- Let's get out of here.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.498
- Team's arriving.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.805
- Did you get a hit?

32:19.838 --> 32:21.307
- Not exactly.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.309
We showed a shop owner
a picture of the kid.

32:23.342 --> 32:24.776
He hadn't seen her.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.679
Said two other guys showed up
looking for her as well though,

32:27.713 --> 32:29.448
wearing motorcycle vests.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.151
- Mayans.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.519
- Yes, sir.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.022
They were just looking
for the kid, not Adelita.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.624
We were everywhere.
Didn't spot 'em.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.727
- You put the M.C. on--
- No.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.132
Expand our watch list.

32:46.165 --> 32:49.501
Track the M.C.,
where they go, who they meet.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.370
- Yes, sir.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.019
- Putting bullets
in the car--

33:07.053 --> 33:09.021
you knew the shots
would bring the cops.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.226
It's fuckin' smart.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.695
- Sometimes that happens.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.704
- Did she say who else
put in a bid?

33:25.737 --> 33:26.805
- Yeah, big agri.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.208
It has to be Cargill,
maybe Dole.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.177
Maybe the Chinese.

33:31.210 --> 33:34.080
- I'll find out who
we're up against.

33:34.113 --> 33:37.049
- Then what?

33:37.083 --> 33:38.917
- I'll handle it.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.855
- What does that mean?

33:47.259 --> 33:48.560
No.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.729
You cannot bring the other
world into this, Miguel.

33:50.762 --> 33:52.398
- Well, what, you think
these big corporations

33:52.431 --> 33:53.399
don't break the law?

33:53.432 --> 33:54.733
Their CEOs are all corrupt.

33:54.766 --> 33:57.569
Fucking country club criminals.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.671
- If you cross that line,

33:59.705 --> 34:01.107
even just once,

34:01.140 --> 34:04.443
you undermine all the work
you've done to go legitimate.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.278
You fuck up your legacy.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.015
This isn't just about you.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.084
It's about your son

34:12.118 --> 34:13.485
and his sons.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.192
I'll talk to Iliana.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.361
I'll see what I can find out.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.801
- What's the matter?
- Have you heard from Dita?

34:31.270 --> 34:32.738
- What?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.240
No, why?

34:34.273 --> 34:35.241
- She's gone.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.375
She finished with her doc

34:36.408 --> 34:37.976
but never came back
to the waiting room.

34:38.009 --> 34:39.378
She must have left
through a back door.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.613
- Wait, left?
Where?

34:41.647 --> 34:43.149
- Sorry, Mikey,
I don't know.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.022
- Be right with you.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.796
- Hola, Ignacio.

35:07.639 --> 35:10.342
Señora Galindo.

35:37.236 --> 35:38.370
- You good?

35:38.404 --> 35:40.606
- Yeah, I'll get the bikes.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.107
- Hoses around the back.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.176
Gate should be open.
- Thanks.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.756
- Santo Padre.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.025
Huh.

36:00.058 --> 36:03.094
You're a long way
from home, amigo.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.565
- You guys aren't letting
all them Mexican rapists

36:06.598 --> 36:08.400
hop the fences, are you?

36:08.434 --> 36:10.001
- Little bit worried.
- Yeah.

36:10.035 --> 36:12.804
- I'll keep my--
- Prospect.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.873
Don't play with the animals.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.743
They might look dumb
and harmless,

36:17.776 --> 36:21.980
but trust me, they're
some nasty motherfuckers.

36:22.013 --> 36:25.050
- Fuck you, Medina.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.956
- That's Stockton's finest.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.361
Welcome to northern Cali.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.608
- How's she doing?

36:49.641 --> 36:52.511
- I think she'll be okay.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.847
All she knows
how to do is run...

36:55.881 --> 36:58.617
from one place to the next.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.919
- I get that.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.358
- Do you think the soldiers
saw her?

37:06.392 --> 37:07.759
- No.

37:07.793 --> 37:10.596
They did,
they wouldn't have left.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.066
Thank you for letting her
stay here.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.504
- It's okay.
We'll make it work.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.509
- She feels safe with you.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.783
- Um, maybe we should, uh,
keep the door closed.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.116
- Cristobal.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.242
- My boys...

39:07.879 --> 39:10.048
They have a different name.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.851
And, uh, no connection
to my past.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.122
- Our past doesn't just
go away.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.394
We're all connected, Ignacio.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.696
- Felipe.

39:32.571 --> 39:35.106
- All right.
Thank you.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.577
- Anything?

39:38.610 --> 39:41.447
-  None of the hospitals
or clinics have her.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.981
- That's a good thing.

39:43.815 --> 39:46.051
- I reached out to our friend
in the sheriff department.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.554
He's gonna put something out
on the wire, keep it anonymous.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.557
He'll turn out with something.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.560
- Señor Galindo,
she's here.

39:54.593 --> 39:55.727
Pulling in now.

40:03.101 --> 40:05.504
- Did you ever find out?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.239
- Find out what?

40:12.944 --> 40:15.313
It was nice to see you.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.984
We should do this again.
- Mamá!

40:43.675 --> 40:45.343
- Gracias.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.877
- Come on, prospect.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.345
We're grabbing some food.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.035
- Lead the way, pendejos.

41:57.716 --> 41:59.084
- I gave her an Ambien.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.352
She'll sleep.

42:01.386 --> 42:03.889
Maybe she'll tell us more
in the morning.

42:03.922 --> 42:05.724
- What the fuck was that today?

42:06.725 --> 42:10.395
I mean, why go to that shop?

42:10.428 --> 42:12.097
See EZ's father?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.532
- I don't know.

42:14.566 --> 42:17.736
I've never mentioned anything.

42:17.769 --> 42:21.707
I mean, she knows we get
our meat from there sometimes.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.778
She agreed to go
to a shrink.

42:30.415 --> 42:33.384
Your mom will get better, baby.

43:19.965 --> 43:21.767
Dude...

43:21.800 --> 43:23.735
get her phone.

43:23.769 --> 43:24.836
Get this.

43:25.937 --> 43:27.105
- What?

43:27.138 --> 43:28.573
- Get...

43:28.606 --> 43:30.575
and tape it.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.977
- Are you serious?

43:32.010 --> 43:33.311
- Yeah, I want to send it
to my ex.

43:34.646 --> 43:36.982
- I want Annie to see
that I found a new whore.

43:37.015 --> 43:40.051
- Yeah, where'd you steal
this from, Hope?

43:40.786 --> 43:41.920
- Come here, come here,
come here, come here,

43:41.953 --> 43:43.021
come here, come here.

43:44.355 --> 43:47.258
- This is so fucking...

43:47.292 --> 43:50.261
Come on, man, I'm starving.

43:50.295 --> 43:53.398
- Hurry up before
the truck leaves.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.502
- Come in just to check it out.

43:57.535 --> 44:00.138
- I gotta take a piss, man.
- All right then.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.309
- You may want to keep an eye
on him, all right?

44:04.342 --> 44:05.643
- Yeah.

44:05.677 --> 44:06.912
- All right.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.785
Hey, prospect.

44:13.819 --> 44:15.787
Recycle that shit.

44:15.821 --> 44:18.489
Plastic and can--
in that one.

44:20.225 --> 44:21.693
- Yes, sir.

44:21.727 --> 44:23.361
- Andale pues.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.399
- Dude, you're so fucked up.

44:28.433 --> 44:30.836
- I'm just misunderstood.
- Hey.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.304
- What the fuck...

44:49.620 --> 44:50.922
- EZ?

44:50.956 --> 44:52.090
- Medina?

44:52.123 --> 44:53.925
No! No, no, no, no!

44:53.959 --> 44:56.461
Que pasol?

44:59.430 --> 45:00.866
- Shit!

45:00.899 --> 45:02.734
Medina...

45:02.768 --> 45:03.902
Medina!

45:03.935 --> 45:05.837
- He's gone.

45:09.140 --> 45:11.242
- Search the woods!

45:14.946 --> 45:16.514
- Let's get
these motherfuckers!

46:16.674 --> 46:19.010
(hard rock music plays)

46:24.382 --> 46:26.384
(rock music continues)

46:31.389 --> 46:32.623
(motor revs)

46:40.531 --> 46:41.732
(hissing)

46:41.833 --> 46:43.668
ANNOUNCER: Mayans.

46:43.701 --> 46:46.504
All new Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.975
You can't make people
like you,

46:50.008 --> 46:52.377
but if people
don't respect you,

46:52.410 --> 46:53.879
you can make 'em fear you.

47:04.189 --> 47:05.991
I'll see you at the lake.

47:06.657 --> 47:07.658
(gasps)

47:14.933 --> 47:16.567
-(recorder playing theme song)
-(babbling)

47:16.601 --> 47:17.602
Pink eye!

47:19.370 --> 47:22.073
(grunting)

47:22.107 --> 47:24.109
(babbling)

47:24.876 --> 47:26.244
Pink eye!

47:26.277 --> 47:28.446
FRANK: Don't judge me!
This is art!

47:28.546 --> 47:29.514
(recorder hits sour note)
