MOHINDER: (NARRA TING)
The sun rises on a new dawn,

00:16.893 --> 00:21.557
yet few us realize the debt
we owe to those responsible
for this,

00:21.647 --> 00:28.268
to those who dwell among us,
anonymous, seeming/y ordinary,

00:28.529 --> 00:32.442
whom destiny brought together
to repair, to heal,

00:32.533 --> 00:35.366
to save us from ourselves.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.449
MOHINDER: If evolution can
do this for even
the smallest of creatures,

00:39.540 --> 00:41.701
then why not
these human beings?

00:41.792 --> 00:45.785
If someone here
found out about me,
what would happen?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.245
When will they stop?

00:47.340 --> 00:48.420
I don't know.

00:48.841 --> 00:52.459
She's a shiny new toy,
and she's all mine.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.971
MOHINDER: (NARRA TING) And
they’re still out there
among us

00:57.058 --> 00:59.219
in the shadows, in the light.

00:59.310 --> 01:01.972
We pass them on the street
without a glance,

01:02.063 --> 01:04.600
never suspecting,
never knowing.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.523
Do they even know yet

01:09.070 --> 01:12.233
that they are bound together
by a common purpose,

01:12.323 --> 01:16.987
a glaring reality,
to be extraordinary?

01:17.161 --> 01:21.154
MOHINDER: Teleportation,
tissue regeneration. These
are no longer simply theories.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.581
l have seen them
with my own eyes.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.741
MOHINDER: (NARRA TING)
And when destiny
does anoint them...

01:25.836 --> 01:28.828
My name is Hiro Nakamura.
I'm from the future.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.918
...how do they
hide from it?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.168
You may feel confined here,

01:32.260 --> 01:35.673
but this is far freer
a cage than the one
they'd put you in.

01:35.846 --> 01:39.464
MOHINDER: (NARRA TING) How long
can they dwell in the shadows
before either fate

01:39.558 --> 01:44.643
or their own flawed
humanity draws them out
into the light again?

01:45.314 --> 01:48.932
And how will they know
what awaits them
when it finally does?

01:52.154 --> 01:55.772
And not only
are these special
individuals among us,

01:55.866 --> 01:57.447
they bear a curse,

01:57.535 --> 02:00.447
a virus which
strips them
of their powers

02:01.706 --> 02:03.287
andleadsto
their eventual death.

02:03.374 --> 02:06.832
In the last few months,
I have discovered what
I believe to be a plague.

02:06.919 --> 02:10.161
A plague which targets
only these unique individuals.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.838
It's a disease which threatens
to eradicate them all,

02:12.925 --> 02:17.510
and in doing so, deprives
our species of its
evolutionary advancement.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.963
Without this advancement,
the challenges
of the modern world,

02:21.058 --> 02:24.391
global warming, terrorism,
diminishing resources,

02:24.478 --> 02:28.221
seem almost insurmountable
on our thin shoulders.

02:28.774 --> 02:32.062
The fate of humanity itself
hangs in the balance.

02:32.153 --> 02:34.485
But with proper funding
and research,

02:34.572 --> 02:36.654
we can stop
the advancement
of this disease.

02:36.741 --> 02:39.528
I urge each and every one
of you to take up this cause,

02:39.618 --> 02:44.032
spread the word
and fight those who would
keep the world from the truth.

02:44.582 --> 02:46.573
Thank you all for coming.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.050
Inspirational lecture,
Dr. Suresh.

02:55.134 --> 02:57.967
l was wondering
if I could trouble you
for an autograph.

02:58.054 --> 03:00.636
Your father would have
been so proud.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.929
So would your sister.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.475
Who the hell are you
and why are you following me?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.063
This isn't necessary.
I'm nobody.

03:08.147 --> 03:09.227
What, you think
I didn't recognize you?

03:09.273 --> 03:11.013
You've been at three
of my lectures.
Yeah.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.520
The Company send you
to bag and tag me?
Is that it?

03:13.611 --> 03:15.192
A year ago
I would've run.
But not anymore.

03:15.279 --> 03:19.613
That's good. Because if you
had, I wouldn't be able
to offer you a job.

03:22.620 --> 03:26.112
I've been down
that road before.
It doesn't end well.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.868
Where will you go,
Dr. Suresh?

03:28.959 --> 03:31.371
No one even believes
they exist.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.667
I found your father's book
in the parapsychology section,

03:35.758 --> 03:38.966
in between hypnosis
and alien abductions.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.796
They don't take you seriously.
They all think you're nuts.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.639
But not me.

03:46.602 --> 03:49.844
So if you're really
interested in saving
the world,

03:50.481 --> 03:53.644
the least you could do
is let me buy you a drink.

it's not exactly my place,

Yes, sir.

23:21.484 --> 23:22.644
Yeah.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.942
Well,

23:25.780 --> 23:27.020
we'll see.

23:27.115 --> 23:32.075
The Company was formed
30 years ago with a group
of like-minded individuals.

23:32.161 --> 23:36.370
Ordinary men and women
who were gifted
with extraordinary powers.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.748
They wanted to
help their own.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.703

and to protect them.

23:43.548 --> 23:47.632
We find people and we
make sure they don't
become dangerous.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.884
Now, sometimes
that can mean
making sure

23:50.972 --> 23:53.930
they understand entirely
what they're capable of

23:54.017 --> 23:58.181
and teaching them to use
their abilities for the good
of mankind.

it can mean

24:11.659 --> 24:12.774

willing to kill him
for the greater good.

You acted on
a moral imperative
to protect your species.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.794
It doesn't matter
one way or the other
about Sylar.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.042
He's no longer a threat.
He's dead.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.294
And now you have Molly.

24:30.887 --> 24:34.880

are protecting her.

what would happen

if that virus mutated
and crossed over
into the general population?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.509

you're talking about

(EXCLAIMS IN JAPANESE)

36:18.677 --> 36:20.508
Sorry. Sorry.

36:20.596 --> 36:24.965
So, I came over on one
of the few trade vessels
your emperor let pass.

36:25.059 --> 36:28.597
The boat left full of tea,
I kept on to find my fortune.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.599
You should see what I get paid
to fend off those bandits.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.932
Kensei Takezo does not
fight for money,
he fights for honor.

36:35.027 --> 36:37.894
Really? Well, as long as
it's honor I can spend.

36:38.614 --> 36:41.526
It's not a bad lot.
I mean, I find a stout brute,

36:41.617 --> 36:44.029
put him on a horse,
put him on a field
and tell him to shout on

36:44.119 --> 36:46.280
about how
he's fearsome old Kensei.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.828
Then I repair
to the branch of a tree

36:47.915 --> 36:49.746
and start to pick off
the blackguards,
one by one.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.334
That's fighting dirty.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.500
That's fighting smart, sir.

36:54.088 --> 36:55.999
I give him a fair wage.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.129
If he lives.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.586
No. This can't be.

No. I come from the future.

Yes.

the village of Otsu.

one of us sent these?

39:44.633 --> 39:45.713
Yes.

39:46.176 --> 39:49.794

The people we have killed.
