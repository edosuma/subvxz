00:07.900 --> 00:09.800
        Oh, Woody.              

00:09.900 --> 00:11.600
Our baby-sitter                 
just canceled.                  

00:11.700 --> 00:13.200
         Could you sit          
    with Frederick tonight?     

00:13.200 --> 00:14.300
                     Okay.      

00:14.300 --> 00:15.900
Oh, great, Woody.               
Thanks.                         

00:15.900 --> 00:18.000
        Yeah, I'm used to it.   

00:18.000 --> 00:20.900
              I used to baby-sit
        a lot back in Hanover...

00:21.000 --> 00:22.700
      well, before the incident.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
          You know...           

00:29.200 --> 00:30.800
I think Lilith's mother         
owes us a favor.                

00:30.800 --> 00:31.900
Thanks anyway, Woody.           

00:32.000 --> 00:34.200
                Oh, good, Woody,
         come here for a minute.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.800
        Listen, I'm gonna go out
         of town for the weekend

00:35.900 --> 00:37.100
                  and I want you
                 to feed my cat.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.500
  Now I know it's an imposition,
                  but, you know.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.200
    Okay.                       

00:41.200 --> 00:42.900
        Well, you're really good
    with animals, aren't you?   

00:43.000 --> 00:44.500
    Well, yeah.                 

00:44.500 --> 00:47.100
I mean, I had lots of pets      
back in Hanover...              

00:47.300 --> 00:49.600
before the incident.            

00:51.900 --> 00:53.600
                    Yeah, Woody,
              on second thought,

00:53.700 --> 00:54.900
                I'm gonna ask   
          my next-door neighbor,

00:54.900 --> 00:56.500
              but thanks anyway.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.700
                     Hey, Woody,

00:57.700 --> 00:58.900
                 that's a really
                clever trick.   

00:59.000 --> 01:00.500
            You get out of doing
             anything with that.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.800
             Yeah.              

01:01.900 --> 01:05.700
  Just wish I'd thought of it   
      before the incident.      

01:10.600 --> 01:13.700

01:53.400 --> 01:55.700
We realize                      
it's short notice,              

01:55.700 --> 01:57.000
but this dinner tonight         
is something                    

01:57.100 --> 01:58.500
we simply cannot miss.          

01:58.600 --> 02:00.400
We're desperate                 
to get a sitter.                

02:00.400 --> 02:01.700
      I would really like       
     to help you guys out,      

02:01.800 --> 02:03.300
 but children make me nervous.  

02:03.300 --> 02:05.000
I'm afraid I'm gonna drop them. 

02:05.100 --> 02:06.500
            Oh, Rebecca...      

02:06.600 --> 02:08.199
            holding a baby is   
              the simplest thing

02:08.300 --> 02:09.199
in the world.                   

02:09.300 --> 02:11.500
         (glass breaks)         

02:12.900 --> 02:14.400
  I'm sorry. What did you say?  

02:15.600 --> 02:17.200
            Thanks anyway.      

02:21.200 --> 02:22.400
             Kelly,             

02:22.500 --> 02:23.900
                  how was class?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.200
        (sighs heavily):        
 I'd rather not talk about it.  

02:27.400 --> 02:28.600
    I'm sorry, Woody.           

02:28.700 --> 02:30.700
I didn't mean to jump down      
     your throat like that.     

02:33.600 --> 02:36.000
                     Well, uh...

02:36.100 --> 02:37.200
              what's wrong?     

02:37.200 --> 02:39.300
     Well, my final project     
         for sociology          

02:39.400 --> 02:42.000
      is an in-depth study      
of a past work experience.      

02:42.000 --> 02:43.700
And I've never had a job.       

02:43.800 --> 02:45.800
I don't know                    
what I'm gonna do.              

02:45.900 --> 02:48.800
        Well, let me get        
        this straight--         

02:48.800 --> 02:51.500
            you can't do your   
        little school project   

02:51.600 --> 02:52.900
                  because you're
                stinkin' rich   

02:53.000 --> 02:54.800
    and you never had to work   
             a day in your life?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.500
    Yeah.                       

02:56.600 --> 02:59.800
          And I used to complain
         because I had no shoes.

03:02.600 --> 03:06.800
     I feel so out of place     
     in my sociology class.     

03:06.800 --> 03:09.200
Do you know what it's like      
    to sit in school all day    

03:09.300 --> 03:10.900
  and not contribute anything?  

03:11.000 --> 03:15.100
    Well, it's been a long time,
    but that sounds familiar.   

03:15.200 --> 03:18.900
    I don't even know           
    how to get a job.           
                          Kelly,

03:18.900 --> 03:20.700
        come over here, here.   

03:20.800 --> 03:22.200
                    Want ads.   
                        Okay?   

03:22.300 --> 03:23.300
        Plenty of jobs in there.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.500
            If you can't find   
                 anything there,

03:24.600 --> 03:25.900
      call an employment agency.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.700
                Plenty of places
                to get a job.   

03:27.800 --> 03:30.200
Hey, you know, Norm,            
for a guy who's unemployed,     

03:30.300 --> 03:32.100
you certainly know a lot        
about getting work.             

03:32.100 --> 03:34.000
             Well, Cliff, I know
         a lot about water, too,

03:34.000 --> 03:35.800
            but you don't see me
                    drinking it.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.000
                Uh, Ms. Howe,   
                    do you think

03:40.100 --> 03:41.900
                Kelly could work
            here for a while?   

03:41.900 --> 03:43.200
         I know she doesn't have
            any experience...   

03:43.200 --> 03:44.700
I don't think so, Woody.        

03:44.800 --> 03:47.600
                Oh, well, I just
                thought I'd ask.

03:47.700 --> 03:49.000
            It's no big deal.   

03:49.000 --> 03:49.800
          Look, Woody.          

03:49.900 --> 03:53.000
    It says here I can make     
         $10,000 a week         

03:53.100 --> 03:54.700
        being an escort.        

03:54.700 --> 03:57.500
        Okay, Ms. Howe,         
      now it's a big deal.      

03:57.600 --> 03:58.700
                 Please, please,
              let her work here.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.000
              You can always use
                an extra hand   

04:00.000 --> 04:01.400
                and you don't   
                have to pay her.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.900
                 Yeah, it's just
             for the experience.

04:02.900 --> 04:03.900
All right, Woody,               
all right.                      

04:04.000 --> 04:05.900
As a favor to you.              

04:05.900 --> 04:07.400
But this is                     
a real business.                

04:07.400 --> 04:08.800
This is not                     
a training ground.              

04:08.900 --> 04:10.700
We need people to work here who 
really know what they're doing. 

04:10.800 --> 04:13.500
         (glass breaks)         

04:13.600 --> 04:15.600
Tell her to wear shoes.         

04:17.600 --> 04:18.800
            Thanks, Ms. Howe.   

04:18.899 --> 04:21.200
    Hey, Kelly, guess what?     

04:21.200 --> 04:22.700
Ms. Howe said                   
you can work here.              

04:22.800 --> 04:25.700
                         Really?
            Oh, that's great.   

04:25.700 --> 04:27.100
        Oh, thanks, Ms. Howe.   

04:27.100 --> 04:28.500
Oh, welcome aboard, Kelly.      

04:28.500 --> 04:30.800
                 I can't believe
              I have a real job.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.100
You know what                   
to do with this.                

04:32.100 --> 04:33.800
                 Wow, I sure do.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.600
    Do you guys have lobster    
      for lunch every day?      

04:41.000 --> 04:43.500
      Well, does that mean      
you're canceling tonight?       

04:43.600 --> 04:44.800
     All right, all right.      

04:44.800 --> 04:47.700
  Well, maybe some other time.  

04:47.800 --> 04:50.800
Boy, women'll break a date      
 with you at the drop of a hat. 

04:50.900 --> 04:53.600
      Like her grandmother      
 won't still be dead tomorrow.  

04:58.800 --> 05:02.900
Sam, am I to understand that you
 suddenly have the night free?  

05:03.000 --> 05:04.600
 Yeah, you got anything for me? 

05:04.700 --> 05:05.700
                  Perhaps.      

05:05.700 --> 05:06.900
                  Quite cute.   

05:06.900 --> 05:08.200
        Oh, yeah?               
          Cute's nice.          

05:08.200 --> 05:09.000
                 And young.     

05:09.100 --> 05:09.800
    Oh, I like young.           

05:10.000 --> 05:11.200
     Give me more details.      

05:11.200 --> 05:12.900
     Well, about 32 inches.     

05:12.900 --> 05:16.600
     I usually I like them      
  a little bustier than that.   

05:16.700 --> 05:18.200
     I'm just trying to find out

05:18.200 --> 05:20.500
        if you would like to sit
          for Frederick tonight.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.300
        Oh, yeah.               
      I'd love to do that.      

05:22.300 --> 05:23.700
            Really?             
    I love that little guy.     
            Why not?            

05:23.800 --> 05:25.200
            Done deal.          
                      All right.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.100
Frasier, can I                  
speak with you?                 

05:31.100 --> 05:34.000
I don't know how comfortable    
I feel with this setup.         

05:34.100 --> 05:36.600
He's just a baby.               
He needs supervision.           

05:36.600 --> 05:38.300
                Well, Sam can   
                take care of it.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.200
I'm talking about Sam.          

05:42.200 --> 05:44.800
You know how out of control     
he can get at times,            

05:44.800 --> 05:46.800
what a mess he can              
make of everything.             

05:46.900 --> 05:48.100
      Well, Sam can clean it up.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.800
              Oh, you're talking
                      about Sam.
I'm talking about Sam.          

05:51.900 --> 05:55.100
             Darling, it'll just
             be for a few hours.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.200
All right.                      

05:56.200 --> 05:59.200
But if anything goes wrong,     
he could be scarred for life.   

05:59.300 --> 05:59.900
            You mean Sam, right?

06:00.100 --> 06:02.300
Yes, and it is a threat.        

06:03.400 --> 06:06.300
Sam, can you be at our place    
in about an hour?               

06:06.300 --> 06:07.000
            You bet.            

06:07.200 --> 06:08.600
    Where are you guys          
         going tonight?         

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
 Oh, well, I'm proud to tell you
             that my lovely wife

06:10.700 --> 06:12.700
        is being honored tonight
     by the scientific community

06:12.700 --> 06:16.300
    for her contributions to the
study of sensory deprivation.   

06:16.400 --> 06:18.500
It was serendipitous,           
I admit.                        

06:18.600 --> 06:21.500
I'd returned to the lab         
after a two-week holiday        

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
to find that I'd locked         
my lab assistant                

06:23.500 --> 06:25.000
in the isolation tank.          

06:25.100 --> 06:27.600
Suffice it to say, what could   
have been an ugly lawsuit       

06:27.700 --> 06:30.500
turned into                     
an award-winning paper.         

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
                     Say, Carla,

06:36.900 --> 06:39.200
 I'm, uh, baby-sitting tonight. 

06:39.300 --> 06:41.300
You got any advice for me?      

06:41.400 --> 06:44.300
Sure. Here's everything         
you need to know about babies.  

06:44.400 --> 06:46.700
Remember,                       
you're the boss.                
                        Yeah.   

06:46.700 --> 06:48.000
Don't let him                   
give you any lip.               

06:48.000 --> 06:49.400
And if they start               
to act crabby,                  

06:49.500 --> 06:50.800
stick a bottle                  
in their mouths.                

06:50.900 --> 06:52.300
                     Great.     

06:52.300 --> 06:54.000
                    Okay, great.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.700
          Okay, I'm ready.      
Okay.                           

06:55.800 --> 06:58.600
Here's everything you need      
to know about customers.        

06:58.700 --> 07:00.700
Remember,                       
you're the boss.                

07:00.800 --> 07:02.200
Don't let 'em                   
give you any lip.               

07:02.300 --> 07:03.900
And if they start               
to act crabby,                  

07:04.000 --> 07:05.500
just stick a bottle             
in their mouths.                

07:07.900 --> 07:10.000
Hey, Miss.                      
I ordered a beer.               

07:25.300 --> 07:26.800
  And he passes to Frederick.   

07:26.800 --> 07:28.800
    Frederick takes the ball    
      and goes for a jam.       

07:28.900 --> 07:30.100
        Yes! Yes!               

07:30.100 --> 07:31.800
        He's a freshman         

07:31.900 --> 07:32.700
  out of the learning center.   

07:32.900 --> 07:34.200
              Yes!              
         Oh, a rookie.          

07:34.300 --> 07:35.400
        Wonderful shot.         

07:35.400 --> 07:37.000
          Here we go.           
    Take another one.           

07:37.000 --> 07:38.200
      He goes for the jam.      

07:38.200 --> 07:39.500
    He goes. He runs.           

07:39.500 --> 07:40.700
  The Garden is going cra....   

07:40.700 --> 07:42.600
Oh. It's...                     

07:45.400 --> 07:46.500
Great shot.                     

07:46.500 --> 07:47.900
          Great shot.           

07:47.900 --> 07:49.800
Okay, Malone, top of the key... 

07:49.900 --> 07:51.400
      Do you want to watch      
          a little TV?          

07:51.500 --> 07:52.900
    (pants slightly):           
      You know something?       

07:53.000 --> 07:54.400
      That's a good idea.       

07:54.400 --> 07:56.100
        Uncle Sam               
    is a little tired here.     

07:56.200 --> 07:57.300
Whoo!                           

07:57.400 --> 07:58.600
     Good idea, good idea.      

07:58.700 --> 08:01.600
I don't know how to do this one.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.300
Do you know how to...           

08:02.500 --> 08:04.200
I have a different one          
at home there.                  

08:04.300 --> 08:05.600
         (TV clicks on)         
      Oh, far out. Thanks.      

08:05.700 --> 08:06.800
         That's great.          

08:06.900 --> 08:09.700
        Oh, great,              
    this is <i>The Flintstones.</i>    

08:09.800 --> 08:12.000
  This is the one where Barney  
gets stuck in the mailbox.      

08:12.100 --> 08:15.300
I actually haven't seen this one
    all the way to the end.     

08:15.400 --> 08:17.100
            Freddie?            

08:18.900 --> 08:21.900
        Hey, Fred,              
    whatcha doing in there?     

08:24.400 --> 08:25.500
          Peek-a-boo!           

08:25.600 --> 08:27.700
    (doorknob rattles)          

08:27.700 --> 08:28.700
            Freddie?            

08:28.700 --> 08:29.900
             Uh-oh.             

08:29.900 --> 08:32.100
         Uh... oh, boy.         
             Fred.              

08:32.100 --> 08:34.200
     Hey, listen to me now.     
     Listen to Uncle Sammy.     

08:34.299 --> 08:36.799
Unlock the door, Freddie.       

08:36.900 --> 08:38.299
  T... Freddie, turn the knob.  

08:38.400 --> 08:39.700
    You see the knob?           
     See that little knob?      

08:39.799 --> 08:41.400
    Turn the knob, Freddie.     

08:41.500 --> 08:42.500
        (toilet flushes)        

08:42.600 --> 08:45.200
     No, wrong knob, Fred.      

08:45.300 --> 08:46.300
             Shoot.             

08:46.400 --> 08:48.600
      Um, okay, all right.      

08:48.700 --> 08:50.300
I'll get you out of there.      

08:50.300 --> 08:52.500
  Got to be a key around here.  

08:54.800 --> 08:57.100
        (giggles)               

08:57.200 --> 08:58.900
        Oh, I know what         
      I'm gonna do, Fred.       

08:59.000 --> 09:02.300
  We'll do the old credit card  
  jimmying the lock open here.  

09:03.300 --> 09:05.200
  I don't have a credit card.   

09:06.400 --> 09:08.200
      I know, here, here,       
        I'll use a $20.         

09:08.300 --> 09:10.500
      This is gonna work.       
      This is gonna work.       

09:10.600 --> 09:12.100
Yeah, here we go, Freddie.      

09:12.100 --> 09:13.200
      This is gonna work.       

09:13.300 --> 09:14.800
     No, Freddie... hey...      

09:14.900 --> 09:16.500
      give me my $20 back.      

09:16.600 --> 09:17.700
        (toilet flushes)        
        Fred, no.               

09:17.800 --> 09:19.300
    Don't fl... oh... shoot.    

09:19.300 --> 09:20.600
         You little...          

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
      I'm in trouble here.      

09:24.500 --> 09:26.100
    Okay, don't worry.          

09:26.100 --> 09:29.900
  Uncle Sammy's gonna get you   
     out of there, Freddie.     

09:30.000 --> 09:33.100
  Yeah, I'll just come around   
        the window here.        

09:33.200 --> 09:34.300
              Ooh.              

09:34.300 --> 09:36.000
We're way high, aren't we?      

09:38.400 --> 09:40.000
             Okay.              

09:40.100 --> 09:41.900
          No big deal.          

09:43.500 --> 09:44.800
              Ooh.              

09:44.900 --> 09:46.300
             Okay.              

09:46.400 --> 09:47.500
          Here we go.           

09:47.600 --> 09:49.000
    Here comes Uncle Sammy.     

09:59.000 --> 10:00.700
        Oh, yeah.               

10:00.800 --> 10:02.500
        Oh, yeah.               
         Burglar-proof.         

10:02.600 --> 10:04.600
          Right. Yeah.          

10:04.600 --> 10:07.200
  Your mommy and daddy told me  
    about that, didn't they?    

10:07.200 --> 10:08.400
             Okay.              

10:12.200 --> 10:14.000
         Hey, Freddie.          

10:14.100 --> 10:15.300
             Whoo!              

10:15.300 --> 10:16.500
            (groans)            

10:16.600 --> 10:18.200
    Damn, damn, damn!           

10:19.300 --> 10:20.800
 You didn't hear that, Freddie. 

10:20.900 --> 10:22.000
     You didn't hear that.      

10:24.100 --> 10:25.600
        (groans):               
             Oh...!             

10:25.700 --> 10:27.300
            Damn it!            

10:27.400 --> 10:29.000
You heard that one, didn't you? 

10:30.300 --> 10:32.900
        Hey, Freddie...         

10:33.000 --> 10:36.100
    Uncle Sammy doesn't know    
        what to do here.        

10:36.200 --> 10:38.800
Can you open this window?       

10:38.900 --> 10:40.700
  Do you know the word "open"?  

10:40.700 --> 10:43.600
Yeah, yeah, open.               

10:43.700 --> 10:45.400
             Open.              

10:45.500 --> 10:47.500
    Can you open the window?    

10:47.600 --> 10:50.100
 D-do you know the word "open"? 

10:53.100 --> 10:54.300
        Good boy.               

10:54.400 --> 10:56.000
                        Bye-bye.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.400
Carla, I just waited            
on a man at table 5             

11:09.500 --> 11:11.500
and he left too much            
money on the table.             

11:11.600 --> 11:12.700
Should we go find him?          

11:15.100 --> 11:18.100
        No, uh, you see, this   
          is what we call a tip.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.500
     It's a little monetary gift
          for the head waitress.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.700
    Here you go.                

11:25.300 --> 11:27.200
Boy, do I feel dumb.            

11:27.300 --> 11:29.700
        Oh, no, you're just new.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.200
            Kelly, can I have   
                 a beer, please?

11:34.300 --> 11:35.900
Okay, let me go get Woody.      

11:35.900 --> 11:37.100
 Oh, no, you don't need Woody.  

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
            Come here. I'm gonna
         show you how it's done.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.900
                Take a glass,   

11:40.900 --> 11:43.400
             stick it underneath
          this black lever here,

11:43.400 --> 11:44.600
                     okay?      

11:44.700 --> 11:47.800
         Voilá, you have a beer.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.600
Now there's a, uh, black book   
underneath the cash register.   

11:50.700 --> 11:52.100
     It says "Norm's tab" on it.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.500
     You mean this one here     
  with all these little marks?  

11:54.600 --> 11:55.600
             Right.             

11:55.700 --> 11:57.500
 Now, Kelly, each one of these  
          little marks          

11:57.600 --> 12:01.900
     represents a beer that     
 I've purchased... in advance.  

12:05.200 --> 12:07.700
    Every time I order one,     
  you have to take this eraser  

12:07.700 --> 12:10.300
    and, uh, erase one          
     of those little marks.     

12:12.100 --> 12:13.100
Don't forget to erase now.      

12:13.100 --> 12:14.700
  I don't want any free beers!  

12:14.800 --> 12:16.900
      Okay, Mr. Peterson.       

12:17.000 --> 12:17.900
                      Thank you.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.300
Unbelievable!                   

12:21.400 --> 12:23.400
I'm in the presence             
of sheer genius.                

12:23.500 --> 12:24.500
              Thank you, Cliffy.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.200
            Kelly, can I have   
                    another beer

12:26.200 --> 12:28.000
              for my dear friend
                Clifford Clavin?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.300
    And what the heck,          
      take it off my tab.       

12:36.800 --> 12:38.100
         Hey, Freddie!          
      (knocking on window)      

12:38.100 --> 12:40.800
Freddie, Uncle Sammy needs      
      some help here, bud.      

12:40.900 --> 12:44.300
        Hey, Fred,              
    do you know about rain?     

12:44.400 --> 12:46.100
Because that's what's happening 
    out here, Freddie.          

12:46.200 --> 12:47.500
You know...                     

12:47.500 --> 12:50.300
      ¶ Itsy-bitsy spider       
    went up the waterspout ¶    

12:50.400 --> 12:52.500
    (thunder rumbling)          

12:52.700 --> 12:54.000
Okay, Fred.                     

12:54.100 --> 12:57.400
Look, back away from the window 
          there, Fred.          

12:57.500 --> 12:59.700
Uncle Sammy's gonna break       
         the window...          

12:59.700 --> 13:02.400
     and every little bone      
          in his hand.          

13:02.500 --> 13:04.000
              Oh!               

13:04.100 --> 13:05.100
          Okay, Fred.           

13:05.100 --> 13:07.200
Tell you what I'm gonna do here.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.900
I'm gonna jump over to that tree
    and climb on down.          

13:11.000 --> 13:15.600
     I'll be back in just,      
before you can... Oh! Oh!       

13:15.700 --> 13:17.500
(crashing)                      

13:18.400 --> 13:19.600
              Bye.              

13:26.600 --> 13:30.500
        Carla, I need to ask you
    some questions for my paper,

13:30.600 --> 13:31.800
      since you're my co-worker.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.100
            How do you feel that
             the work experience

13:36.100 --> 13:37.800
         has enriched your life?

13:37.900 --> 13:43.900
It's given me varicose veins,   
stomach acid, lower back pain   

13:43.900 --> 13:46.500
and a complete hatred           
for all mankind.                

13:46.600 --> 13:48.900
            That's great.       

13:48.900 --> 13:52.200
     And what would you say     
are the negative aspects?       

13:54.200 --> 13:56.000
      Just do the dishes.       

13:56.100 --> 13:58.700
             Yeah.              
     I hate that one, too.      

13:58.800 --> 14:01.700
  We have an Australian couple  
      that do it at home.       

14:01.800 --> 14:04.700
                    Oh...       

14:04.700 --> 14:07.800
 By the way, here's another one 
      of those tip things.      

14:07.900 --> 14:10.100
Why, thank you very much, Kelly.

14:10.200 --> 14:15.400
Boy, she is really dumber       
          than cotton.          

14:15.500 --> 14:16.100
          Hey, Carla.           

14:16.300 --> 14:17.600
          Hey, Cotton.          

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
            Who's ready, huh?   
                    You thirsty?

14:25.100 --> 14:26.000
                        Come on.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.700
         Norm, come on.         
      Let us buy a round.       

14:27.700 --> 14:29.100
                    I insist.   

14:29.100 --> 14:31.300
      Kelly, another round      
for my friends here, okay?      

14:31.400 --> 14:33.100
      Okay, Mr. Peterson,       

14:33.200 --> 14:36.500
 but my hands are getting sore  
     from all that erasing.     

14:36.700 --> 14:38.900
        Now, now, Kelly,        
     you wanted a real job.     

14:38.900 --> 14:40.000
You can't go through life       

14:40.100 --> 14:42.100
getting everything handed       
        to you for free.        

14:42.200 --> 14:43.800
 Let's get some beer over here. 

14:46.200 --> 14:47.400
          How about you fellows?
                      You ready?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.600
Oh, we've really got            
to get back to the site, Norm.  

14:49.600 --> 14:52.200
  Come on. You're only working  
      on the second floor.      
Yeah!                           

14:53.900 --> 14:56.000
    A round for these guys.     

14:58.300 --> 15:02.200
          Hey-hey-hey,          
     isn't that that Henri?     

15:02.200 --> 15:03.800
                    Oh, yeah,   

15:04.000 --> 15:05.200
it's Pepe LePew himself.        

15:05.300 --> 15:07.900
Yeah, he's got                  
a lot of guts                   

15:08.000 --> 15:10.400
showing his sleazy Gallic mug   
around this place.              

15:10.500 --> 15:12.000
                        Yeah.   

15:12.000 --> 15:13.100
      If I was, uh, Woody,      

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
    I'd have popped that guy    
a long time ago, you know?      

15:14.300 --> 15:15.400
        Hello, fellows!         

15:15.500 --> 15:17.200
              ALL:              
          Hey, Henri!           

15:17.200 --> 15:18.900
                What do you say?
                 Buy you a beer?

15:18.900 --> 15:20.600
And he's such a phony, you know?

15:22.500 --> 15:25.800
Uh, Woody, loan me              
ten dollars until payday.       

15:25.800 --> 15:27.900
              When's payday?    

15:28.000 --> 15:30.100
         How do I know?         
 You're the one who's working.  

15:31.600 --> 15:33.100
                          Kelly!

15:33.100 --> 15:35.500
              What are you doing
              with those drinks?

15:35.600 --> 15:36.800
Hello, Henri.                   

15:36.800 --> 15:38.100
 I'm working here for a while.  

15:38.100 --> 15:39.500
      Isn't that exciting?      

15:39.600 --> 15:40.900
Yes, you are!                   

15:40.900 --> 15:43.100
                Serve me a drink

15:43.100 --> 15:45.600
             so that I may pinch
    your bottom as you leave.   

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
        Henri, I wish you'd stop
        saying things like that.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.300
Well, Woody,                    
but I am the customer,          

15:53.400 --> 15:55.400
and the customer                
is always right.                

15:55.500 --> 15:57.300
                        Darn.   

15:57.400 --> 15:59.100
    Got me on a technicality.   

16:00.700 --> 16:03.800
 You know, if this Kelly thing  
        works out,              

16:03.900 --> 16:06.200
    I might finally be able     
      to take my vacation.      

16:06.300 --> 16:08.300
    The last one I had          
      was three years ago       

16:08.300 --> 16:10.400
    when I went to Graceland    
         for a weekend.         

16:10.500 --> 16:12.700
    But now I got six weeks     
        saved up.               

16:12.800 --> 16:14.300
    I'm gonna take me           
        a real vacation.        

16:14.300 --> 16:15.700
         Where are you gonna go?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.800
    Graceland.                  

16:20.200 --> 16:24.100
Woody, may I have a soda,       
            please?             

16:24.100 --> 16:26.700
    Stealing your girlfriend    
        is thirsty work.        

16:26.800 --> 16:28.100
    All right, Henri,           

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
  I don't know how things are   
        in France,              

16:30.200 --> 16:32.100
        but in America,         
guys don't like other guys      

16:32.100 --> 16:33.300
saying they're gonna steal      
    their girlfriend.           

16:33.400 --> 16:34.400
        It's not polite.        

16:34.600 --> 16:36.800
     Oh! I'm, I'm so sorry.     

16:36.900 --> 16:37.900
      I, I see your point.      

16:38.000 --> 16:39.800
Uh, as we say in France...      

16:39.900 --> 16:43.300
  <i>Je vais te piquer ta copine.</i>  

16:43.300 --> 16:44.500
      What does that mean?      

16:44.600 --> 16:46.400
    I'm going to steal          
        your girlfriend.        

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
Wait a minute.                  

16:47.400 --> 16:48.700
You take that back.             

16:48.700 --> 16:49.900
                  Oh!           

16:50.000 --> 16:51.300
    I-I...                      

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
What are you doing?!            

16:54.600 --> 16:56.200
            What are you doing?!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.900
    Oh, hey, Freddie!           

17:12.000 --> 17:13.599
        I'm back.               

17:13.700 --> 17:16.599
    I must have blacked out     
    there for a while.          

17:16.700 --> 17:18.200
             Whoo!              

17:18.300 --> 17:20.500
Uncle Sammy sure is lucky       

17:20.599 --> 17:24.300
    the glass recycling bin     
        broke his fall.         

17:24.500 --> 17:25.700
         I'll tell you.         

17:25.800 --> 17:29.300
Somebody sure drinks a lot      
 of wine in this building. Uh!  

17:29.400 --> 17:31.200
You look all tuckered out there.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.700
    What do you say we watch    

17:32.700 --> 17:35.300
        a little,               
 a little television here, huh? 

17:39.900 --> 17:41.000
        Oh, shoot!              

17:41.100 --> 17:42.700
      <i>Flintstones</i> are over.     

17:45.000 --> 17:46.500
             Fred?              

17:46.600 --> 17:48.200
            Freddie?            

17:48.300 --> 17:49.100
          Oh, no, man!          

17:49.200 --> 17:51.500
      Don't lock... shoot!      

17:51.500 --> 17:52.800
    Come on, Freddie!           

17:52.800 --> 17:54.300
    It was funny once!          

17:57.800 --> 18:00.800
        All right.              

18:00.900 --> 18:04.000
  Okay, Freddie, here I come.   

18:06.100 --> 18:08.500
    Oh, no, no-no-no.           

18:17.800 --> 18:19.200
          There we go.          

18:20.800 --> 18:22.800
  Okay, Freddie, here I come.   

18:37.500 --> 18:38.900
            Freddie!            

18:38.900 --> 18:41.100
  Freddie, what are you doing   
        to Uncle Sammy?         

18:41.200 --> 18:43.500
            Come on.            
  Bring the dog back, Freddie.  

18:49.100 --> 18:50.900
    Woody, can I talk to you    
      for minute, please?       

18:51.000 --> 18:52.100
        Sure, Ms. Howe.         

18:54.200 --> 18:57.300
     Woody, I don't think things
     are working out with Kelly.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.800
Oh, well, that's my fault.      

18:58.900 --> 19:00.400
I'm afraid of commitment.       

19:02.300 --> 19:05.000
              Woody, I mean here
                     at the bar.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.800
             I mean, she's a big
             distraction to you;

19:06.900 --> 19:08.200
         your work is suffering;

19:08.300 --> 19:10.600
         and, and this bar fight
         is just the last straw.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.600
            I'm afraid I'm gonna
             have to let her go.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.400
         Well, I guess          
that was a tough decision       

19:15.500 --> 19:16.900
for you to make, Ms. Howe.      

19:16.900 --> 19:19.300
 Yeah, well, sometimes managers 
    have to learn how           

19:19.400 --> 19:22.300
 to give bad news to employees. 

19:22.300 --> 19:25.100
        So go fire              
    your girlfriend, Woody.     

19:26.400 --> 19:28.500
Hey, I'm getting better at that.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
                 I think I'll go
                get a facial.   

19:30.100 --> 19:31.300
          I earned it.          

19:31.300 --> 19:33.500
Wait. Whoa, wait a minute.      
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.   

19:33.600 --> 19:34.800
Is it true?                     

19:34.800 --> 19:36.300
Are you firing Kelly?           

19:36.300 --> 19:38.800
Because I want you to know      
that she is the best thing      

19:38.900 --> 19:40.400
that's ever happened            
to this bar!                    

19:40.500 --> 19:43.200
  Since when did you ever care  
    what happened to Kelly?     

19:43.300 --> 19:44.900
    Wait. Whoa, wait, whoa!     

19:45.000 --> 19:46.600
        Something's happening   
                    to Kelly?   

19:46.600 --> 19:48.200
              She's not leaving,
                         is she?

19:48.200 --> 19:50.000
Yes, as a matter of fact,       
            she is.             

19:50.100 --> 19:52.400
I guess you're both going to    
have to learn to live with it.  

19:52.400 --> 19:54.700
    She's here one day          
    and everybody loves her.    

19:54.700 --> 19:57.600
      I'm here five years       
    and nobody gives a damn!    

19:59.500 --> 20:03.100
    By the way, Norm.           
  why'd you want her to stay?   

20:03.200 --> 20:05.000
     None of your business.     

20:05.000 --> 20:06.900
  Why'd <i>you</i> want her to stay?   

20:06.900 --> 20:08.700
     None of your business.     

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
What did you want               
to talk about, Woody?           

20:25.100 --> 20:28.100
          Well, Kelly, you don't
          really like this place

20:28.200 --> 20:29.500
          all that much, do you?

20:29.600 --> 20:30.300
Oh, sure I do.                  

20:30.400 --> 20:31.900
I love this place.              

20:31.900 --> 20:34.400
      It's keen.                

20:34.400 --> 20:35.800
                        Oh, boy.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.000
            Kelly, Cheers is not
             such a great place.

20:39.100 --> 20:40.200
Well, what                      
do you mean, Woody?             

20:40.200 --> 20:42.800
            Oh, I mean it's nice
                 on the surface,

20:42.900 --> 20:44.800
                but when you get
            right down to it,   

20:44.900 --> 20:46.400
             there's a dark side
                      to Cheers.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.300
      Really?                   

20:47.400 --> 20:51.700
        Aw, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,
                you're so naive.

20:51.700 --> 20:55.400
                 Nobody respects
                anybody here.   

20:55.500 --> 20:56.600
                Oh, they're nice
                to your face,   

20:56.700 --> 20:58.300
                     but as soon
             as you turn around,

20:58.300 --> 21:00.500
    they're plotting some way   
              to get rid of you.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.000
            And they never do   
        their own dirty work.   

21:02.000 --> 21:04.200
                Nope. No, no.   
                They wouldn't   
                  stoop to that.

21:04.300 --> 21:07.000
          They'd rather use some
          poor innocent farm boy

21:07.000 --> 21:08.600
to carry out                    
their sinister deeds            

21:08.700 --> 21:10.500
      while they go prancing off
                to get a facial!

21:10.500 --> 21:12.100
Well, I'm not doing it anymore! 

21:12.200 --> 21:13.200
            I quit!             

21:13.200 --> 21:15.300
    Then I quit, too!           

21:17.000 --> 21:18.600
        Bye, everybody.         

21:20.800 --> 21:25.000
 Oh, man, I knew that I should  
  not have had Woody fire her.  

21:25.100 --> 21:26.600
                    When am I   
                    gonna learn?

21:26.700 --> 21:28.200
     If you want something      
          done right,           

21:28.300 --> 21:29.100
  you've gotta do it yourself.  

21:29.200 --> 21:31.700
        (glasses break)         

21:31.800 --> 21:34.400
 Be careful walking back here.  

21:37.400 --> 21:38.300
        Ms. Howe.               

21:38.400 --> 21:39.600
     Yes? What do you want?     

21:39.700 --> 21:42.000
Well, uh, listen,               
I've had a lot of time          

21:42.000 --> 21:44.900
to think since I quit,          

21:45.000 --> 21:46.300
and, uh, I've done              
a little growing up             

21:46.400 --> 21:48.600
and, and, and if you haven't    
filled my old position yet,     

21:48.700 --> 21:50.400
I'd like to...                  
                    Woody!      

21:50.400 --> 21:53.700
I-I-I know that I'll have       
  to go back to starting wages  

21:53.800 --> 21:56.000
and, and that                   
I'll lose my seniority.         
                        Woody...

21:56.100 --> 21:57.700
    I-I-I know it'll take me    
    a few weeks to...           

21:57.800 --> 22:01.500
             Woody, just shut up
        and get to work! God!   

22:01.600 --> 22:04.900
Boy, they sure aren't very nice 
    to new employees.           

22:14.000 --> 22:15.500
 Darling, do my eyes deceive me 

22:15.600 --> 22:18.500
or is our little Frederick      
        actually asleep?        

22:18.500 --> 22:21.300
                      Oh, he is!

22:21.400 --> 22:23.000
          Where's Sam?          

22:24.100 --> 22:26.300
    (banging outside)           

22:26.300 --> 22:27.800
    Sam!                        

22:27.900 --> 22:30.000
     Over here in the tree.     

22:30.000 --> 22:32.400
  But I can still see the kid.  

22:32.500 --> 22:34.600
             Whoo!
