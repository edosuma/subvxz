TERRY WENTZ: You go out in
the field and you look up in the sky

02:30.400 --> 02:31.651
and you see the stars,

02:31.735 --> 02:35.571
and some of that light
that's coming down to your eye

02:35.656 --> 02:38.574
has been traveling for millions of years.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.077
So you look up
and you're looking at the past,

02:41.245 --> 02:43.246
and then you look down,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.289
and you're looking at the past.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.669
You know, those dinosaur bones
are millions of years old,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.588
and that light left there, maybe
at the same time that you're looking.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.341
lt's just you're kind of
sandwiched in that world,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.928
and it's really... Really a wonderful
place being out in a field.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.482
LOUlE PSlHOYOS:
lt was a brilliant story,

03:11.567 --> 03:15.611
l mean, if you didn't have to live it
like the Larsons did.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.326
lt's a good American tale.

03:22.411 --> 03:28.457
Unfortunately, it had a bad ending
for a couple of real brilliant paleontologists.

(WlND BLOWlNG)

04:25.641 --> 04:30.186
PETER: We'd been digging at
the Ruth Mason Quarry since 1979.

04:31.063 --> 04:35.441
The 1990 season,
I think we were into the third month.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.947
We'd been working north...

04:41.031 --> 04:43.240
Actually not working
at the quarry itself anymore.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.868
We were actually prospecting
and looking for fossils.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.662
We were looking for fossils
on Sharky Williams'

04:47.746 --> 04:51.290
and his brother Maurice Williams' ranch,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.417
and finding some pretty cool stuff.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.797
And we get up on August 1 2th,
look outside the tent, and it's foggy.

04:57.881 --> 05:01.050
lt's kind of a weird thing
to have fog on the prairie.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.302
So we got a little bit later start.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.888
We weren't in any big hurry
because you couldn't see very well,

05:05.973 --> 05:09.266
and then went out to
start loading up the Suburban.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.811
We have a 1 975 Suburban, all rusted out.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.982
And l look and the tire's flat.
(CHUCKLES)

05:16.066 --> 05:19.610
So l say, "Oh, crap." Well, almost flat.
Still had a little bit of air in it.

05:19.736 --> 05:23.906
So l go in the back to get the spare tire,

05:23.991 --> 05:25.950
and the spare tire's flat.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.494
So l pull out the tire pump,

05:28.704 --> 05:31.080
and the tire pump hose is broken.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.666
So we figure,
"l guess we better...

05:33.750 --> 05:35.001
"We better head into town

05:35.085 --> 05:36.961
"while we still have enough
air in the tire to get there."

05:37.087 --> 05:38.713
WENTZ: We decided,
"Well, we're gonna have to go to town."

05:38.797 --> 05:40.840
You know, l'd been out there
for four or five weeks.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.510
Going to town, that's okay.
l can take it easy for half an hour, an hour.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.221
That's fine with me, but, of course, Susan...

05:48.098 --> 05:52.101
Susan just can't handle that.
You know, that's a waste of time, right?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.353
SUSAN HENDRlCKSON:
There was the flat tire. l said, "Great.

05:54.438 --> 05:58.315
"You guys go to town. You don't need me.
l've got this place l want to look at."

05:59.443 --> 06:02.695
Out there, you need landmarks
to find your way around.

06:02.863 --> 06:07.116
And I said, "Okay, it's foggy. You can't see.
Make sure you don't walk in a circle."

06:07.576 --> 06:09.952
And two hours later,
l was right back where l started,

06:10.287 --> 06:11.954
and l could not believe it.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.416
l just couldn't believe it 'cause l was,
like, trying so hard to walk straight.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.667
lt was like...

06:16.752 --> 06:18.210
l felt really stupid.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.798
l believe it was the next day when
we went back with the video camera

06:22.883 --> 06:26.802
and just kind of reenacted,
you know, how l found her.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.222
Anybody who had any idea

06:30.307 --> 06:33.559
of what a fossil versus a rock was
would have seen it

06:33.643 --> 06:36.896
'cause there was
a lot of broken bones dribbling down.

06:37.064 --> 06:41.150
About eight foot up the side of the cliff,
there were three articulated vertebrae

06:41.276 --> 06:43.486
and a couple of other pieces
of bone sticking out.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.530
From the debris pile, l picked up scraps

06:47.157 --> 06:49.366
that showed the hollowness
and took it with,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.911
'cause l knew if l went back
to where they were working,

06:51.995 --> 06:53.996
they wouldn't believe me.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.458
We got back after fixing the tire
and we were at the dig site.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.170
We were just finishing up doing stuff,
and Susan comes up.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.255
And she opens her hand,

07:03.340 --> 07:07.343
and she's got
two pretty small pieces of bone,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.553
only about this big, in her hand.

07:09.805 --> 07:12.932
And l'd never seen the inside
of a T. rex vertebra before,

07:13.016 --> 07:16.268
but l knew exactly that was
what she had in her hand,

07:16.353 --> 07:19.522
and l says, "ls there more of it?"
She said, "There's a lot more."

07:19.606 --> 07:21.899
So we ran, literally ran back to the site.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.652
(MUSlC PLAYlNG)

07:32.035 --> 07:35.704
PETER: l crawl up on the cliff face
and l see three articulated vertebrae,

07:36.081 --> 07:37.414
and from that point on,

07:37.499 --> 07:41.418
l'm absolutely certain this is gonna be
the best thing we ever found

07:41.503 --> 07:43.170
and it's gonna be a complete T. rex.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.005
NEAL LARSON: He called up and said,

07:45.090 --> 07:48.384
"Neal, l need you to bring
a lot of plaster two-by-fours."

07:49.010 --> 07:50.594
Well, it took me a day
to get everything ready,

07:50.679 --> 07:52.972
and l came up, and l got up
there with all these materials,

07:53.056 --> 07:55.975
and he took me over to this big cliff,

07:56.059 --> 07:58.018
and he said, "Take a look."

07:58.145 --> 07:59.478
And l looked at it, and l looked at him.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.940
l said, "ls that T. rex?" He said, "Yes,

08:03.233 --> 08:05.484
"and l think it's all here."

08:10.407 --> 08:12.867
And we haven't started digging
or haven't moved anything around yet.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.494
We've just been looking at it
and taking some pictures

08:15.579 --> 08:17.705
and trying to figure out how to proceed.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.958
There's a real mass of bones here.
Some are caught up in concretion,

08:21.084 --> 08:24.128
but most appear to be
really excellently preserved.

08:24.546 --> 08:28.924
And l believe that the tail's going that way
and the skull is going this way,

08:30.051 --> 08:32.219
but we're just gonna
have to dig it up and see.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.556
PETER: Collecting fossils
is something that's very timely.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.683
Fossils are discovered
because they're weathering out,

08:38.768 --> 08:40.936
because the forces of nature,

08:41.020 --> 08:45.024
rain, winds, freezing,
thawing, even snowfall,

08:45.108 --> 08:46.609
have an effect on that fossil.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.571
Every day that it's outside
is a day that it's going to destruction.

08:53.909 --> 08:58.162
NEAL: We started by picking up
all these thousands of fragments of bones

08:58.246 --> 09:00.623
and bagging them and labeling them.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.669
WENTZ: Well, the plan of attack
is to protect the specimen, first of all,

09:05.754 --> 09:08.672
and then you go above the specimen
and dig down to it,

09:08.798 --> 09:12.927
so that you can get all the way around it
to remove it from the cliff.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.770
PETER: We basically used these
ditch-digging tools, picks and shovels,

09:22.854 --> 09:24.438
to dig down that 30 feet

09:24.522 --> 09:28.984
from where l thought
we could get back into the cliff face

09:29.152 --> 09:33.197
far enough to uncover what l thought
would be the limits of that skeleton.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.828
NEAL: Probably the hardest work
l've ever had to do in my life.

09:39.913 --> 09:45.376
We were doing this all in temperatures
around 1 1 5 degrees every day.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.422
PETER: lt was very hard work

09:50.507 --> 09:54.969
but it was very easy
to put in a lot of energy into it

09:55.053 --> 09:58.514
because we all wanted to see
what the skeleton was going to look like.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.311
WENTZ: Basically, we'd take different
sections, so we weren't in each other's way,

10:04.396 --> 10:08.524
and just kind of worked the specimen
until we could start removing bones.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.280
HENDRlCKSON: You know, and every time
somebody found a bone or a fragment,

10:14.364 --> 10:15.656
theyjust said, "The 'S' bone."

10:15.740 --> 10:18.200
We wouldn't say, "Skull."
We didn't want to jinx it.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.787
PETER: Pretty early on,

10:21.871 --> 10:25.165
l hit something hard, and so l stopped.
(LAUGHS)

10:28.003 --> 10:30.045
"lt's the 'S' word," l said,

10:30.422 --> 10:32.172
thinking, "l bet l hit the skull."

10:40.390 --> 10:41.640
When l got down digging,

10:41.725 --> 10:44.351
and then started really
working with the smaller knife,

10:44.436 --> 10:46.353
we found, as we were going down,

10:46.438 --> 10:47.896
is the back of the skull.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.944
And we're getting down
and here's this skull taking shape,

10:54.029 --> 10:55.529
and we get out on the side,

10:55.613 --> 10:57.990
and l put Terry to work
on cleaning the side of the skull

10:58.074 --> 11:00.784
'cause he's really our best preparator.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.414
WENTZ: Pete let me work on part of the skull
in the field, which was amazing.

11:08.251 --> 11:12.254
PETER: He's working and uncovering
the teeth one by one by one.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.843
NEAL: lt was spectacular.

11:17.927 --> 11:22.431
Teeth like this
just sticking right out of the skull.

11:22.599 --> 11:26.060
We're going, "Oh, my God.
Look at this thing. Look how huge it is.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.187
"This has gotta be bigger than the one
at the American Museum.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.189
"lt's huge. lt's wonderful."

11:41.034 --> 11:44.828
We had started a long time ago
naming particular dinosaurs,

11:44.913 --> 11:49.041
and the name Sue, for Susan Hendrickson,
goes down in history,

11:49.125 --> 11:50.542
and l think that's kind of a cool way

11:50.627 --> 11:54.129
to reward those amateurs
who make these discoveries.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.724
WENTZ: We were all experienced diggers.
You know, it was just a total focused effort.

12:05.809 --> 12:10.687
We would just work into the specimen,
remove things that we could,

12:10.772 --> 12:11.980
protect the rest of it,

12:12.065 --> 12:15.567
and then take it out of the ground
and get it back into the laboratory,

12:15.735 --> 12:17.820
where you can have
a more controlled environment

12:17.904 --> 12:19.905
to take care of the specimen.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.116
NEAL:
The amount of new things that we found

12:22.200 --> 12:23.617
and the amount of scientific information

12:23.701 --> 12:26.870
that we discovered while finding Sue
was enormous.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.248
PETER:
Beautifully preserved, articulated skull,

12:29.332 --> 12:32.084
articulated vertebral column up to the pelvis

12:32.168 --> 12:34.753
with the tail and shoulder blade
and all this stuff,

12:34.838 --> 12:37.131
and it's just like, "Holy cow."
And wonderful preservation.

12:37.215 --> 12:42.428
Just fantastic bones that were...
Just beautiful surface on them.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.768
NEAL:
Every time we were ready to take a bone out

12:49.853 --> 12:51.270
or every time there was some new discovery,

12:51.354 --> 12:53.063
Pete would take this butcher paper out,

12:53.148 --> 12:55.858
and he mapped each and every bone,
one on one,

12:55.942 --> 12:57.484
that we found that was excavated.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.475
NEAL: Pete and l had quite
a few discussions, "What would be fair?"

13:29.559 --> 13:33.187
$5,000 is the most that anybody
had ever given anyone for a dinosaur,

13:33.313 --> 13:35.606
for any fossil in the ground.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.065
So Pete wrote a check out for him

13:37.150 --> 13:39.776
and a contract
that he wanted Maurice to sign.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.154
l showed it to him, and he said,
"We don't need to sign anything.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.406
"This is something...
A handshake between friends,

13:44.741 --> 13:47.242
"and the $5,000 is fine. I'm happy with that."

13:47.327 --> 13:49.953
And, you know, that was the most
that any landowner had ever gotten.

13:50.038 --> 13:54.374
We shook hands, and he was pretty excited
about seeing it set up in the museum.

14:04.802 --> 14:08.138
Last phase of getting Sue out of the ground

14:08.223 --> 14:13.352
we used, basically, Egyptian techniques
to get this large block.

14:13.603 --> 14:18.732
l mean, one of the blocks weighed
probably something close to 10,000 pounds.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.528
There was probably about 10 ton
of material, total, that we had to load up.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.831
NEAL: Once we had the skull and pelvic block
and the tail vertebrae and everything else,

14:34.916 --> 14:37.626
we knew we could haul
a lot of the stuff on our Bobcat trailer.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.379
We had no idea how we were going to
be able to get all these other things.

14:40.463 --> 14:45.425
My brother John had built
a tandem-axle trailer earlier that year.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.886
PETER: With that and the other
pickup truck that we had there,

14:47.971 --> 14:51.682
we were able to load the fossil up.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.478
After we had built pallets
underneath the fossil,

14:56.604 --> 14:58.689
we were able to scooch
some plywood underneath 'em,

14:58.773 --> 15:01.233
so that we could move it
with chains and come-alongs

15:01.317 --> 15:03.860
and get it into the trailers.

16:53.137 --> 16:56.556
What some kids might find
1 00 years from now

that greater understanding.

PSlHOYOS: We know nothing
about the history of the planet

17:01.354 --> 17:03.522
unless learning it through a paleontologist.

17:03.606 --> 17:07.317
And it's that sense of deep time,
real deep time,

17:07.734 --> 17:11.445
that gives you a sense of who you are
and how you fit into the scheme of things.

PETER: I first fell in love with fossils
when l was about four years old.

17:53.531 --> 17:58.827
l picked up this small tooth
down on my folks' ranch.

17:59.871 --> 18:04.332
From then on, l just was so fascinated
with fossils. l just couldn't stop.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.086
Every day that the weather was good
and every day that the weather was great

18:08.171 --> 18:09.963
that was on a weekend,
if we were going to school

18:10.047 --> 18:12.132
or in the summertime,
Dad would always say,

18:12.216 --> 18:13.383
"Let's go out rock hunting."

18:23.728 --> 18:25.771
PETER:
We ended up starting this little museum,

18:25.855 --> 18:28.690
and we'd charge the adults
in our family five cents.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.609
We had little displays

18:30.693 --> 18:32.235
where we set up the things
that we had collected.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.613
Notjust fossils and rocks,

18:34.697 --> 18:37.157
but also what we thought were antiques.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.995
We had this horrible hobby that started
to captivate every part of our life.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.918
PETER: Eventually l decided
to really get into paleontology,

18:48.127 --> 18:51.254
and so went to the South Dakota School
of Mines and Technology in Rapid City.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.719
Junior year, we went to
the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show,

18:57.804 --> 19:02.098
and really saw how specimens
are purchased by museums

19:02.183 --> 19:03.892
and purchased by private collectors.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.063
And by the time we graduated,

19:08.147 --> 19:10.065
we started this business
called Black Hills Minerals

19:10.191 --> 19:12.150
as this Earth science supply house.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.865
Eventually my younger brother Neal,

19:18.950 --> 19:20.742
who was also a student
at the School of Mines,

19:20.868 --> 19:22.744
and Bob Farrar, one of his classmates,

19:22.870 --> 19:24.746
started working with us as well.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.833
BOB FARRAR: With the three ofus
all going to the School of Mines,

19:27.917 --> 19:30.627
we were problems there because

19:30.711 --> 19:34.047
all of us chose not to go into industry.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.552
NEAL: The first year was terrible,
the second year was not so good,

19:38.636 --> 19:40.929
but it was sort of turning into a business.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.351
PETER: As we kept going,
we kept collecting more and more fossils

19:46.435 --> 19:51.940
and had the idea of, "lt probably would work
to sell these as display specimens."

19:52.608 --> 19:56.570
NEAL: ln 1978, we were going pretty strong.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.488
We were selling mostly fossils.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.408

20:04.287 --> 20:06.204
we created this new entity

20:06.289 --> 20:09.791
called Black Hills Institute of

I first met Pete Larson when I was in Peru.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.149
l was down there visiting
my friend Kirby Siber,

20:34.442 --> 20:39.321
who was about to go out in the field
and collect some fossil whales and, uh...

20:40.197 --> 20:42.991
And he had asked Pete
to come down to do that,

20:43.284 --> 20:44.784
and the three of us went.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.287
(MUSlC PLAYlNG)

20:52.752 --> 20:55.420
PETER: l had known
Susan Hendrickson for about five years

20:55.504 --> 20:57.756
before she found the dinosaur Sue.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.302
And Susan was one of those volunteers
who came to work at the Ruth Mason Quarry

21:02.386 --> 21:05.931
after we had met in Peru
a number of years before.

21:06.057 --> 21:10.685
HENDRlCKSON: My attraction to him
was his expertise and his enthusiasm

21:10.770 --> 21:13.396
or passion for fossils, which l shared.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.900
Pete is one of the best
paleontologists around.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.028
There's a few other people
that might be at his level.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.781
PETER: There was some
romantic involvement at the time

21:22.865 --> 21:25.867
between Susan Hendrickson and l,
although that was pretty much over.

21:25.993 --> 21:30.372
That was sort of short-lived
and we were, at this point, just friends.

21:30.539 --> 21:34.793
And she was just having
one more season of collecting

21:34.877 --> 21:37.128
before she was moving back to Seattle.

HENDRlCKSON: He had this whole
other part of him, which was the lnstitute,

21:39.799 --> 21:41.257
and he had a lot of responsibilities.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.592
And that part didn't interest me.

l tried to help him, l commended him,

but l didn't want any part of that in my life.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.724
You know, l kept waiting for more field time,

21:49.892 --> 21:51.768
and he didn't like it
if l went in the field by myself

21:51.852 --> 21:54.479

He didn't want me to go.

into the warehouse,

22:22.925 --> 22:26.636
I was cloistered like a monk
in the back corner of the back building.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.264

"Just leave me alone," right?

22:29.348 --> 22:32.600
But everybody was in there.
There would be school kids in there.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.769

22:35.271 --> 22:38.023

working on a major new monograph
on Tyrannosaurus rex,

22:42.653 --> 22:45.363
so you got to suck it up.
Pete wants it this way.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.074
He wants this specimen
available to everybody.

that we'd collected her.

sign this little guest book

23:02.465 --> 23:05.925
that went way in the back in our warehouse
to see the skull of Sue.

23:06.635 --> 23:09.179

when l saw the specimen.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.556
First of all, the size is just so imposing,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.391

23:13.476 --> 23:16.144
was what a greatjob
they were doing preparing the specimen.

that the Black Hills Institute

23:19.231 --> 23:20.774

23:20.983 --> 23:26.404
One of the first things l saw was actually,
you know, part of the skull of Sue

23:26.489 --> 23:28.740
still encased in matrix.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.201
Sixty-five million years later,

23:31.285 --> 23:33.953
this animal really had the power
to give you goose bumps.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.122
To see the look
on Pete's face and Neal's face.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.083
Those guys were just like proud papas.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.919
They would inform you. They would
go do classes at school for the kids,

23:41.003 --> 23:44.172
so it was very educational for all of us.
l learned a lot from that.

23:52.014 --> 23:55.600
PETER: Eversince we created
that little museum on our parents' ranch,

23:55.684 --> 23:58.561
it's always been our dream
to have a museum here in Hill City.

24:00.106 --> 24:04.651
And finding Sue the Tyrannosaurus rex,
here's the anchor for the museum.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.613
The whole town is behind us.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.615
It's going to put Hill City on the map

24:10.699 --> 24:13.034
in a way that it's never
been on the map before.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.790
Didn't matter how many
other projects we had going on.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.417
With Sue, Sue took precedence.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.590
PETER: We found out all kinds
of cool things about this dinosaur.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.968
Broken and healed bones
all over the skeleton.

24:30.052 --> 24:33.388
This animal had a terrible life,
a terrible, rough life.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.350
The skull of Sue actually had...

24:37.560 --> 24:41.521
The left side of the lowerjaw
had been literally ripped out of the socket,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.398
still held together here at the symphysis,

24:43.482 --> 24:45.900
where the two ends of the lowerjaw
come together in the front,

24:46.026 --> 24:48.236
but it's been torn loose from the socket,

24:48.404 --> 24:50.280
which allows the jaw to open and close.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.448
And the postorbital,
the bone directly behind the eye,

24:52.533 --> 24:56.786
was broken and pulled outwards
and laying at sort of a weird angle.

24:57.329 --> 25:01.749
So I think that she actually died from
the attack ofanotherTyrannosaurus rex.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.591
WENTZ: That was a bigjob.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.510
l mean, it took me a year, literally a year,

25:12.595 --> 25:16.848
just to remove individual bones
from around the skull, and then...

25:17.516 --> 25:21.686
And then to take that, the giant hip bones,
off of the nose.

25:26.192 --> 25:29.944

to lift the pelvis off of Sue's skull

was critical to doing it right

That was my concern.

l could just see these idiots,

29:45.576 --> 29:49.203

my dinosaur and take it away and ruin it.

How dare they?
How dare these people do this?

Unconscionable. l can't imagine
somebody being able to do this

could be carefully packed up, we helped.

what they were doing.

a little bit of negotiating.

"You just tell me,
and that fossil won't go anywhere.

"lt's not like it's going
to disappear in a briefcase."

30:33.832 --> 30:36.417
That request was denied.

31:13.747 --> 31:15.790
those of us who were packing the dinosaur

31:15.874 --> 31:18.751
kind of went into our packing mode,

31:18.835 --> 31:20.378
but towards the end of the day,

31:20.462 --> 31:24.340
it became obvious that something
was going on with the town.

31:24.508 --> 31:25.967
NEAL: People around town noticed.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.387
They noticed all the cop cars.
They noticed the police tape.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.056

there were people with signs

31:32.140 --> 31:33.516
out in front of our building.

lt was clear that people were not
happy with what was going on.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.773
The protest developed very quickly,
so there were a lot of people on the street.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.942

l was working for National Geographic,

31:43.026 --> 31:45.319
and we were gonna take the skull of Sue

31:45.404 --> 31:47.863
and put it into a CAT scan
of what they use for the space shuttles

31:47.948 --> 31:50.366

see inside the skull of Sue.

So I got on the next plane I could,
and the place was surrounded by cops.

a real T . rex loose on the property.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.772
on land which was held in trust

for the benefit of Maurice Williams,
the landowner.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.152

42:26.127 --> 42:29.129
Heads of household were given 1 60 acres

42:29.756 --> 42:32.090
in what we call the Allotment Acts.

42:32.342 --> 42:33.550
And that was to try

42:33.635 --> 42:36.637
and make people
who didn't understand land ownership

42:36.721 --> 42:39.431
be owners of land,
but they really didn't own the land.

42:39.515 --> 42:43.227
So there became this concept
of trust responsibility,

42:43.853 --> 42:47.356
and nothing ostensibly is
supposed to happen to that land

42:47.440 --> 42:49.566

of the federal government

42:49.651 --> 42:50.734
through the Bureau of lndian Affairs.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.072
CARSON MURDY: On the reservations,

42:55.156 --> 43:00.827
the United States holds that land in trust
for the individual lndian as the beneficiary.

43:01.079 --> 43:06.166
And the United States
has a fiduciary responsibility

43:06.251 --> 43:09.169
to individual lndians and/or their families

43:09.379 --> 43:11.505
that they get the highest
and best use out of it.

43:14.926 --> 43:20.389
DUFFY: All across the west, it is
a patchwork quilt of laws and regulations

43:20.473 --> 43:25.060
concerning what can and can't be
harvested that's paleontological.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.565
You can be all right in this quarter section,

43:30.650 --> 43:32.067
but if you get off a little bit. . .

43:32.151 --> 43:34.069
Remember, this is before GPS.

43:34.487 --> 43:36.280
lf you get off a little bit to the wrong place,

43:36.364 --> 43:39.116
you might be dealing
with a whole other set of regulations.

43:39.284 --> 43:42.828
The tribe claimed that
because Maurice Williams,

43:43.329 --> 43:44.746
being a member of the tribe,

43:44.831 --> 43:49.459
had not purchased a $1 00 permit
to sell something,

43:49.711 --> 43:53.380
the fossil should be forfeited
and therefore they owned the fossil.

43:53.506 --> 43:56.425
And of course the government said
that it was government property

43:56.509 --> 44:00.554
and that, that was
because of the trust land issue.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.813
The seizure and the subpoena

44:09.897 --> 44:14.276
were the brainchild
of Acting U.S. Attorney Kevin Schieffer.

44:14.402 --> 44:17.612
HARLAN: He was a controversial
figure as a U.S. Attorney

44:17.739 --> 44:21.491
because he hadn't had
a lot of experience practicing law.

44:21.576 --> 44:24.369
He had the ability
to drive some people crazy.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.168
PETER: It's a little unclear

44:31.252 --> 44:35.505
as to why Schieffer decided to seize Sue

44:35.590 --> 44:37.758
or decided to become
interested in this at all,

44:37.925 --> 44:42.012
whether it began with Maurice Williams
or a complaint from the tribe.

44:42.096 --> 44:44.765
Ultimately the decision
was Kevin Schieffer's, though,

44:44.891 --> 44:48.602
to decide that this was something
that they wanted to do.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.817
DUFFY: Also was shocking
from a scientific standpoint,

44:55.902 --> 44:57.819
that anybody would behave so recklessly

44:57.945 --> 45:00.822
with the greatest paleontological find
of all time.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.909
lf that dinosaur seizure
wasn't a publicity stunt,

45:03.993 --> 45:05.160
then l don't know what is.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.788
There could have been a gang in this town

of the government come in

45:36.943 --> 45:39.069

you better answer

that this is wrong.

The U.S. Attorney, Mr. Kevin Schieffer,
made a terrible error

46:57.690 --> 47:00.859
in coming that tragic day
on May 1 4th to Hill City.

47:00.943 --> 47:05.197

the first petition to bring Sue back,

MATKINS: A lot of people didn't have
a lot of money around here,

47:20.963 --> 47:22.881
so they wanted to contribute
any way they could do that,

47:22.965 --> 47:26.384
and so there were a lot of fundraisers,
parades, buttons, posters,

47:26.469 --> 47:28.929
a show of maybe there's justice,

47:29.555 --> 47:32.015
because, l think, to me,
it was just a huge injustice,

47:32.099 --> 47:33.433
the fact they could even do
what they've done.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.769
The custody battle was in full swing,

47:35.853 --> 47:39.231
and it was very dramatic
and scary for people.

47:39.690 --> 47:43.443
And as l interviewed Pete
and talked with him,

47:43.528 --> 47:46.696
I realized at that time
l'd never met anybody like him.

47:47.240 --> 47:51.201
ln his single-minded pursuit
of what he believed was right,

47:51.285 --> 47:54.371
and also, in the flurry of emotions,

47:54.622 --> 47:57.832
l thought that meant that
he was the perfect guy for me.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.877
And so despite the fact
that l was writing about him

48:00.962 --> 48:02.671
and he should be my subject,

48:02.964 --> 48:06.800
l broke the first rule of journalism
and fell in love with my subject.

48:07.677 --> 48:09.427
So we started dating,

48:09.512 --> 48:12.806
and in our emotional ridiculousness,

48:12.974 --> 48:17.143
got married really quite quickly,
within months of my moving here.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.479
But it was okay.

48:19.647 --> 48:21.565
lt was okay for what was going on there.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.526
And so we traversed this together,

48:24.610 --> 48:26.736
and l had created for myself

48:26.821 --> 48:28.738
the additional burden
of trying to be a journalist

48:28.823 --> 48:31.783
and separate my personal feelings
from my job.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.464
MALE REPORTER: Two federal courts
have sided with the government,

48:46.549 --> 48:48.091
saying Sue should stay in the box

48:48.175 --> 48:50.969
because there's no proof
the dinosaur is being damaged there.

48:51.220 --> 48:52.679
ln another federal court,

48:52.763 --> 48:56.224
they're still arguing over
who actually owns the bones.

48:56.350 --> 49:00.854
The intensity of reaction while the court
case was going on really surprised me.

49:00.938 --> 49:03.356
There were people that l thought
were quite reasonable people

49:03.983 --> 49:06.401
who basically

49:07.194 --> 49:09.571
said things about Black Hills
that just were not true.

49:09.655 --> 49:13.783
There's no question that S.V. P. ,
the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology,

49:13.868 --> 49:17.537
was aligned against Peter Larson
and the lnstitute

49:17.872 --> 49:19.497
from the beginning
and all the way to the end.

49:19.624 --> 49:22.792
PETER: I had been a member of the Society
for Vertebrate Paleontology since the '70s.

49:22.877 --> 49:27.756
The S.V.P. became very active in it, in that
they actually sent out two different letters.

49:27.840 --> 49:30.133
One was fully in support
of the U.S. Attorney's action

49:30.217 --> 49:33.219
in seizing the dinosaur, and the other one,
l think, was saying that,

49:33.346 --> 49:35.555
"Yes, it was kept in a perfectly good place."

49:35.723 --> 49:38.141
Which, you know, how can you say that
if you've never seen it?

49:38.225 --> 49:39.809
Many of them have very strong feelings

49:39.894 --> 49:43.271
about whether or not the specimen
should be commercially collected or not.

49:43.481 --> 49:44.648
There is a difference

49:44.732 --> 49:48.109
between the academic perspective

49:48.194 --> 49:49.653
of fossil collecting

49:49.737 --> 49:52.113
and the commercial perspective.

49:52.406 --> 49:56.493
There are some people in this profession
that really, truly believe that it is. . .

49:56.577 --> 49:59.079
There's something morally wrong
with selling a fossil.

49:59.163 --> 50:02.999
l was indoctrinated as an undergrad

50:03.084 --> 50:07.504
that if you don't have a PhD,
you have no right to collect dinosaurs.

50:07.588 --> 50:11.132
l heard about the BHl and Peter Larson
collecting fossils,

50:11.217 --> 50:13.635
and l was told, "These are pirates."

50:13.719 --> 50:18.098
And l visited Pete Larson,
and l visited the Black Hills lnstitute,

50:18.182 --> 50:20.100
and they weren't pirates at all.

50:20.267 --> 50:24.479
They had techniques they taught my crew.
They were better than my crew.

50:24.605 --> 50:27.065
You have academians,
and they have these little fiefdoms.

50:27.149 --> 50:30.235
They built these towers
and they all surround themselves

50:30.319 --> 50:32.612
because they're. . .
They're dependent on money

50:32.738 --> 50:36.366
from grants and other institutions
to do their work.

50:36.534 --> 50:39.911

really great paleontologists

Back in the day, in the early 1 900s,

50:54.343 --> 50:58.680
"commercial collectors" were
filling museums with specimens

50:59.140 --> 51:02.475
and working hand-in-hand
with "academic people."

That was an okay relationship.

Through the pendency of the custody case,

51:34.842 --> 51:38.636
Pete's way of managing stress was to work.

51:38.763 --> 51:42.515
He also was extremely sad.

51:42.600 --> 51:46.060
lt was as if, often, he was in mourning.

to me after all our work in the field

51:50.399 --> 51:52.150

51:52.234 --> 51:55.528

51:56.322 --> 51:58.948
So one way that I was able to

51:59.408 --> 52:02.535
sort of help that was to go and visit her

52:03.120 --> 52:06.623
and to talk with her through the window,
looking at the container.

52:06.707 --> 52:09.542
So l could see her,
see that, that container's still there,

52:10.211 --> 52:13.421
not moved to some other place
in Timbuktu or something.

lt was sweet.

52:42.618 --> 52:45.578
She was his person,

52:45.788 --> 52:48.373

she was more of his person

52:48.457 --> 52:53.670

has ever been and ever will be.

52:53.921 --> 52:58.716
l got to say that dinosaur and Pete Larson
were made for each other.

52:59.051 --> 53:01.344
And so he had to go talk to her,

53:01.428 --> 53:03.388
and that was what. . . How it should be.

53:10.813 --> 53:15.024
PETER: Mostly l was trying to reassure her
that she wasn't going to rot in that case,

53:15.109 --> 53:16.818
that l was gonna spring her free,

53:16.944 --> 53:18.945
somehow l was going to get her out of there.

53:51.312 --> 53:54.355
As that whole custody battle unfolded,

53:54.440 --> 53:57.734
firstly the tribe lost
its own case in tribal court,

53:57.818 --> 54:02.739
which is pretty surprising,
but evident that it was a bad claim.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.991
The government actually retracted its claim

54:05.075 --> 54:07.827
because it realized
it couldn't claim trust property.

54:08.037 --> 54:09.829
So then it comes down to two people.

They had purchased it.
He had accepted the check.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.347
He had been on videotape talking about it.

54:27.514 --> 54:32.060
lt was very clear that he thought
he had sold the fossil at the time.

54:43.656 --> 54:45.490
that a fossil,

54:45.574 --> 54:48.534
unlike an archeological find,

54:48.744 --> 54:52.413
had become. . .
The bones had become mineralized.

54:52.581 --> 54:57.001
Therefore, the fossil was land.

54:57.419 --> 55:02.465
An individual lndian cannot sell land

55:02.549 --> 55:04.842
that the government holds in trust for him

55:05.094 --> 55:06.844
without the permission

55:07.304 --> 55:09.347
of the federal government to begin with.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.391
So that's what ended it.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.976
Fossils are land.

55:23.070 --> 55:25.989
Judge Battey said actually in his filing

55:26.073 --> 55:28.074
that the sale was null and void.

55:28.158 --> 55:31.869
The federal government took the position
that he had no authority himself

55:31.954 --> 55:34.414
to enter into an agreement
with the Black Hills lnstitute.

55:34.540 --> 55:38.876
Peter realized that
he could not have his fossil back.

55:39.253 --> 55:40.378
He was devastated.

55:40.546 --> 55:43.589
The judge decided that Sue was real estate.

55:45.551 --> 55:47.010
Sue, the fossil, was real estate.

55:48.929 --> 55:51.014
For Peter, it was uniquely heartbreaking.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.433
Maybe we're done.

55:54.059 --> 55:56.769
Maybe taking

55:56.895 --> 56:00.481
from Peter Larson the sum of all
his boyhood dreams

56:00.858 --> 56:02.567
would be enough punishment

56:02.693 --> 56:06.112
to end everything that Schieffer had began.

as we called it,

Of course they're not gonna
like what we're doing.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.516
That's the nature of what we do.

56:35.601 --> 56:39.520
But, hopefully, in a broader spectrum,
people can look at it and say,

56:39.646 --> 56:43.816
"Well, l'm glad people can't just go out
into the forest or go out onto the parks

56:43.901 --> 56:46.819
"and take these fossils or. . ."

56:46.904 --> 56:50.490

to do something about it."

not from a Park Service
jurisdiction perspective,

57:10.844 --> 57:14.889
but more from the circumstances
of business practices

57:15.015 --> 57:17.058

and then what did they do with that fossil?

57:38.413 --> 57:40.581
Sell it? What happened to that money?

This should not be allowed to happen.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.397
This is the United States of America.

58:08.235 --> 58:11.195
MALE REPORTER 2: So far, no criminal
charges have been filed in the case.

58:11.280 --> 58:13.823
Members of the Institute
say they're innocent

58:13.907 --> 58:15.825
and are hoping that a new administration

58:15.909 --> 58:18.536
will put an end to their legal fight over Sue.

58:25.377 --> 58:27.587
MALE REPORTER 3: lnstitute officials
thought their problems were over

58:27.671 --> 58:29.755
when Kevin Schieffer
was replaced as U.S. Attorney,

58:29.840 --> 58:32.508
but apparently they continue to be
the target of the federal government.

58:32.593 --> 58:36.179
We have a federal search warrant
issued by the U.S. District Court,

58:36.263 --> 58:37.597
and we're serving a search warrant.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.849
DRUE VlTTER: Enormous amount
of money that the government's spending

58:39.933 --> 58:41.267
to put one person out...

58:41.435 --> 58:44.687
One group of people out of business
that's so vital to a community.

58:44.771 --> 58:48.149
lt's been nearly 1 8 months
since Sue was seized from this warehouse,

58:48.233 --> 58:50.568
and still no charges have been filed
against the lnstitute.

58:50.652 --> 58:53.070
Allow us some rights.
Charge us with something,

58:53.155 --> 58:55.281
and let's go to court. Let 1 2 people decide.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.710
HENDRlCKSON:
l couldn't give them any information

59:07.794 --> 59:10.838
to help incriminate people
at Black Hills lnstitute.

59:10.923 --> 59:12.506
They thought l was
going to be able tell them

59:12.591 --> 59:16.010
all sorts of terrible things the lnstitute did.

59:16.178 --> 59:17.595
Well, they didn't do anything wrong.

59:17.679 --> 59:18.971
They talked to my attorney about,

59:19.056 --> 59:22.308
"You better get your guy in
and bring him on in,

59:22.476 --> 59:24.977
"or, you know, last chance
happening pretty soon."

59:25.062 --> 59:28.272
And my attorney says,
"He just doesn't have anything to tell you."

59:28.607 --> 59:31.943
HENDRlCKSON: For three years,
I had no contact with the Institute.

59:32.152 --> 59:34.779
That's horrible. l mean,
l considered them best friends,

59:34.905 --> 59:36.447
and l couldn't call them up.

59:37.282 --> 59:40.743
FARRAR: Sue was probably the impetus

59:40.827 --> 59:45.081
for the government following up
with a criminal prosecution.

59:45.165 --> 59:49.126
Sue wasn't a part of what we were looking at
or what was being looked at

59:49.211 --> 59:51.420
as far as potential criminal violations.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.089
There were so many bones,

59:53.173 --> 59:56.092
so many animals, so many invertebrates

59:56.301 --> 59:58.678
that were taken off from public lands,

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.389
taken internationally, sold internationally.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.432
There was way more than
we could have ever investigated.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.935
The case was never wanting
for not having Sue.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:11.440
HARLAN:
Because so much material had been seized,

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:16.070
l think everybody thought
that there would be a massive indictment.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:17.905
MAN:
Tell me a little bit about today's indictment.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:21.409
What alleged activity
are we exactly talking about?

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:24.870
ROBERT MANDEL:
This indictment charges the theft of fossils

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.915
off a number of different types
of federal land.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.628
There are also charges in there
that pertain to money laundering,

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:34.714
structuring of currency transactions,

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:38.467
false statements made
to various government agencies.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.012
HARLAN: The indictments
were an avalanche of charges,

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:43.097
and it was just a massive document,

01:00:43.223 --> 01:00:46.726
and it looked like
a deathblow to the lnstitute.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:49.353
The government went just nuts
or something, you know?

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:50.438
l mean, they tried. . .

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:53.107
l guess they just threw everything in
and hoped something would stick.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.651
PETER: lf you add up the time to serve
for each of those counts,

01:00:55.736 --> 01:00:58.029
it comes to 353 years for me,

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:03.701
which is longer than Jeffrey Dahmer
was sentenced to prison for,

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:05.995
and he killed and ate, like, 1 3 people.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.747
You know, it doesn't make sense.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:14.170
A lot of these accusations are
things that we know were legal.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.965
Thirty-eight felony indictments
for collecting fossils?

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:21.344
HENDRlCKSON: lt totally blew me apart.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:24.680
l'm used to fixing things,
and this was unfixable,

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.015
and it was so stupid.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.059
Once you start to
understand the indictments,

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.227
basically this is what they said.

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.021
Pretend we're in Wyoming

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.023
and we're standing
in the middle of the prairie,

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.608
and let's assume for a moment

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.985
that the fence is in the right place.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:41.906
You're standing on this side of the fence.
The government says right over there,

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.867
on the other side of the fence,
is this fabulous fossil,

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:46.285
and they're basically saying

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:50.206
that Pete and Neal and Bob
and whoever was out there would go,

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:51.791
step over the fence,

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:55.961
wrongly, knowingly pick up the fossil
that they're not supposed to pick up,

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.382
carry it back over the fence,
put it in their car.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.134
When they drive from Wyoming
to South Dakota,

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:05.471
they then have conducted
an illegal act, which is called

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:08.891
the interstate transportation
of stolen property.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.684
They get back to the lnstitute.

01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:14.563
They would make a phone call,
send a fax, maybe to Japan, and say,

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.024
"We found the thing
that you were looking for.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:18.901
"Do you want to buy it?"

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.694
Well, that's wire fraud.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:26.075
And then if the Japanese museum
were to purchase that fossil

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:29.370
and the guys would put that money
in the bank, that's money laundering.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:32.957
So basically the guys
were called conspirators

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:37.628
who were creating
this very elaborate scheme

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:40.965
to intentionally steal things
and sell them illegally.

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:44.301
Mafioso master criminals,
Pete, Neal, and Bob.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:45.636
(LAUGHS)

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:49.098
Yeah, they tried to paint a picture that was. . .

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.350
l mean, you know, they're. . .

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.768
Pete and Neal are a couple of kids

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:56.313
that learned how to love fossil collecting
as kids on the ranch.

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:58.190
To think that all of a sudden they decided

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:01.444
to become thieves or something
is just insane.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:19.795
NEAL: As the months went by,

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.007
things seemed to get darker
and darker and darker.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:26.719
For quite a while, we'd hoped
that they'll gain their senses

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.137
and this'll just go away.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:31.557
Because it was
so hotly contested along the way,

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:36.479
l didn't think there would be any chance
that this case would settle before trial.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:40.858
By late summer of '94,
there were serious discussions

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.235
that were going on with
the U.S. Attorney's office

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.653
for a possible resolution.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.655
l go out on my step one morning

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.157
and bring the Rapid City Journal in

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.493
and have a cup of coffee,
and right on the front page

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.203
is the plea agreement announced.

01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:59.126
NEAL: Somebody spilled their guts
in front of Hugh O'Gara,

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.587
and he might as well have taken a gun
and shot us.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:05.633
DUFFY:
The article itself suggested capitulation

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:06.926
on the part of the government.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.594
You never get a good deal done

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:13.015
if somebody is going to be cast
as having folded their tent.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.518
DONNAN: Anybody who would
publish that should know better.

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:19.438
So I called Hugh O'Gara,
and l just said, "What were you thinking?

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:21.357
"How could you do that?"

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:23.234
And he was near tears on the phone.

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:24.652
He would not answer me.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.572
Hugh would never. . . Obviously,
would not tell me who that source was.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:29.823
l wouldn't even ask him.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.158
PETER: The next morning,

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:34.245
the judge called
all the attorneys into chambers.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.206
DUFFY: He went down the line
and made each of us say

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:39.917
that we were not responsible for the leak.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:43.796
He felt that the principals at least
deserved to go to jail.

01:04:43.964 --> 01:04:45.923
He said that he would not accept the plea.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:49.969
He had prejudged the case,
and under two federal statutes

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:52.888
a judge is obligated to remove themselves

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:54.932
from sitting and hearing the rest of the case.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.475
So we filed immediately

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.563
our second recusal motion,
asking the judge to step down.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:03.107
The thing that seems to
upset Judge Battey the most

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:05.401
is not whether he's fair,

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.528
but to be challenged that he's not being fair.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.363
So he immediately denied that motion.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:25.337
l knew this case was going to trial

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:30.467
the day the Hugh O'Gara article
was published in the Rapid City Journal.

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:57.036
PETER: l'm not afraid of 1 2 people,
a jury of 1 2 people of our peers.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.123
l know that they'll look at this case
and they'll see the ridiculous way

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.710
in which the government is behaving,
and they will vindicate us.

01:06:05.253 --> 01:06:07.546
We're innocent of all the things
that we're charged with.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.520
PETER: So in the courtroom,

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:27.775
of course, right in front
is Judge Battey in the bench.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:31.654
Off to the left is the jury,
1 2 jurors, two alternates,

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:34.323
a large space in between where the lawyers

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:36.492
get to pace and walk
and show exhibits and things,

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:41.288
and then we have the prosecution,
which had at times two or three lawyers.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:45.334
On our side, there was
a lawyer for each defendant,

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.420
so there are six lawyers and five defendants.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:52.424
The sixth defendant, of course,
being the Black Hills lnstitute.

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:55.511
Our trial was, and still is,
the largest criminal case

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:56.929
that's ever been tried in South Dakota.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:03.102
WENTZ:
You cannot say the word "Sue" in the trial.

01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:07.022
l mean, the jurors were going,
"What happened to Sue?

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:10.109
"That's why they got these guys
in the court system, right?"

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:12.945
The logistics of this trial
were incomprehensible.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.287
The lnstitute has collected
maybe a million fossils.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:25.374
This indictment covers 1 4 of them,

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:29.586
and those 1 4 fossils
were collected from seven sites.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.672
ln seven cases,

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:34.049
in all the years these guys
have been out in the field,

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:36.468
they are accused of
being in the wrong place.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:38.721
ELLlSON: The government would
simply have their officials come in

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:44.226
of whatever agency was going to be
taking the lead for that particular site

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:47.062
and would say,
"l found where the specimen was collected.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:49.148
"l knew, therefore,
it was on government land."

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:53.235
To me, it just emphasized
the ridiculous nature of this whole thing.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.237
You know, l mean, if it's 200 feet over

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.656
and you don't know where you are,
it would have been okay?

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:05.914
DONNAN: His job had been to appraise
the fossils that had been seized in the case,

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:09.793
and his evaluations
would be incredibly important

01:08:09.878 --> 01:08:14.506
because they determined whether a given
count was a misdemeanor or a felony.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.720
lt was pretty easy in cross-examination

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:24.308
to discover that the man
had not opened the field jackets.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:29.188
He was telling us the values of things
he had not even looked at.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:56.298
HENDRlCKSON: Pete and l, on one of our
trips to Peru, we were taking $1 5,000 in cash

01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:00.385
because down there
you can't use credit cards or anything else.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:04.223
And he withdrew $1 5,000 from the bank,
and we split it up.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.643
Just in case one person got robbed,
at least they wouldn't lose everything.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:09.812
Susan Hendrickson carried 8,000

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.856
and l carried $7,000 down
one of the trips, of cash.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:16.568
We were building a museum,
paying for the bricks and mortar

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.862
and doing the work ourselves
with our Swiss colleagues.

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.457
HENDRlCKSON: ln Japan, they..
The museums pay in cash.

01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:34.169
They always have. Didn't want to
carry bundles of cash on the plane,

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:36.505
so we went to a bank
and put it in traveler's checks.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.799
They were all restrictively
endorsed traveler's checks,

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:42.636
all stamped for deposit only,
deposited in the bank. Paid taxes on them.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.013
Prosecution had four different witnesses,

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:48.015
all of whom testified that
restrictively endorsed traveler's checks

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.350
do not need to be declared.

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.354
What struck me about
the prosecution's case

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.022
was how complex it was.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:58.902
People had to understand
the arcane ins and outs

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:02.990
of bringing traveler's checks
into the country

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:06.451
and latitudes and longitudes
on public lands.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:09.246
And l think they did it in an organized way,

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.291
but it was a very,
very complicated argument.

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.214
KElTH NELSON: When the prosecution rested,

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:23.051
l felt we had put on
the evidence that we had.

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:26.179
We had their own pictures
of them taking these fossils.

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:29.349
We had their own field notes
of them collecting these fossils.

01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:34.813
We had given it 1 00% of our effort
to show what they did.

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:39.985
DONNAN:
As the defense proceeded to present

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.112
many fewer witnesses to say,

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.156
"Look, it's not that complicated.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.451
"We were collecting fossils.
We thought we had permission to be there.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.536
"ln this case, we weren't
where you thought we were.

01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:51.914
"ln this case, we were. lt's that simple."

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.838
ELLlSON: As we were approaching
the end of the trial, Neal and l both felt

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.633
that it was important for him to testify.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.301
NEAL: Three-and-a-half days,
l was on the witness stand,

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:06.261
and for three-and-a-half days,

01:11:06.346 --> 01:11:11.099
l swore to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.233
DONNAN: Pete ended up not testifying.

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:22.027
State had not proven its case.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.198
The state doesn't prove their case,
your client doesn't take the stand, period.

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:30.702
And so on the advice of counsel,
l did not testify.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.348
FEMALE REPORTER:
The jury came back today

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:53.642
in the Hill City fossil hunter
federal criminal trial.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.019
The jury said over and over again

01:11:56.104 --> 01:12:00.399
either not guilty
or no unanimous verdict could be reached.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.484
Of over 1 50 charges,

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:05.237
the jury agreed to convict only 1 3 times,

01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:07.823
and five of those convictions
are for misdemeanor crimes.

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.659
So here is how the convictions break down.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.078
Pete Larson, co-owner
and founder of the lnstitute,

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.622
is convicted on two counts
of misdemeanor thefts

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:18.250
and two felony counts
of illegally transporting money

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.668
in and out of the country.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:23.255
Brother Neal Larson found guilty
of one misdemeanor theft.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:27.384
The jury either acquitted Neal
or couldn't agree on a verdict for the others.

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:30.429
Bob Farrar, a third co-owner of the lnstitute,

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:32.097
convicted of two felonies,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.975
making false statements
to customs officials.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:37.269
And the Black Hills Institute
as a corporation

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.313
is convicted of two misdemeanor thefts,
a felony theft,

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.275
and twice making false statements
to customs officials.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:45.193
The jury also found the lnstitute

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:48.697
guilty of bringing goods into the States
by making a false statement.

01:12:48.948 --> 01:12:53.493
Defendants Eddie Cole and Terry Wentz
were not convicted on any charges.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:03.045
As the verdict was announced,
it was almost impossible to believe

01:13:03.129 --> 01:13:05.881
that the defense
hadn't scored a great victory.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:11.470
However, there were some
fairly significant felony convictions.

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.972
The expression, "You could have
knocked me over with a feather. . ."

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:16.892
You could have
knocked me over with a feather.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:19.061
Four times guilty,

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.896
and l'm trying to look and see,
what is Pat saying?

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.147
"Don't look at it." Then he says,

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.941
"You follow me out of this courtroom,
and l don't want you to say one word."

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:28.236
We got on the elevator, just me and Pete.

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:32.532
Hit one. Started to go down.
Pete said, "l'm finished."

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.202
He said, "These convictions
will completely destroy the lnstitute."

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:41.458
l opened up my suit and l said,
"l got the best prop in the entire world."

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:45.837
NELSON: Duffy, as soon as he hit the door,
had a big ol' cigar in his mouth,

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:49.132
and as he's kind of
holding fort with the media,

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:51.093
he's puffing away on his cigar, saying

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:54.930
that he had won the case,
when he pretty much had to know,

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:57.057
at that moment in time,
that at least his defendant

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.184
was gonna be going to jail for a time

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.561
and was gonna come away from it
a convicted felon.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.897
What l think the cigar did

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.983
was just provide a graphic representation,

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:10.487
easy for anyone to understand,
that all was not lost,

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:13.115
that the word "guilty"
did not mean the end of the world,

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:18.245
and that the town's, you know,
favorite paleontologists were okay.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.813
HARLAN:
l talked to some jurors after the trail.

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.315
Some of them were near tears

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.235
when l interviewed them,
about how they had hoped

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:52.612
they could acquit on every single charge.

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:55.490
LaNlCE ARCHER: l believed they had to have
something to take this to trial,

01:14:55.575 --> 01:14:58.034
and l spend the whole trial
waiting for that something.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.120
Without a doubt,

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:03.331
the majority of the jurors

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:06.001
wanted this whole case
dropped and put away.

01:15:15.219 --> 01:15:17.179
FEMALE REPORTER: Maurice Williams,
the rancher who found Sue,

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:20.390
has received at least six offers
to purchase the T. rex.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:24.394
Since the courts determined that the fossil
is part of Williams' trust property,

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:27.189
any purchase must be approved
by the federal government.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:30.317
Since Sue was seized
by federal agents in 1 992,

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.777
the fossil has been stored
at the School of Mines.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:35.071
MURDY:
My first contact with Mr. Maurice Williams

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:38.783
was when he came to Aberdeen
for a series of meetings

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:45.332
to discuss what he should do
with this fossil.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:48.376
The idea that l had was to convene,

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:51.213
like, a panel of paleontologists

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:54.341
to do an in-depth study of this fossil

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.885
with the hope that it would end up
in a museum somewhere.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:16:00.055
But in the meantime,
while this was being discussed,

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:04.392
Mr. Williams decided that
he would rather sell the fossil.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.816
DAVlD REDDEN:
Maurice Williams had a stack of proposals

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.944
from all sorts of people all over the place.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.111
l mean, everybody wanted it.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:16.655
l called up Maurice and l said,

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.740
"l'm going to come out to South Dakota
if you want,

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:22.577
"and l'll visit with you,"
and he said, "Great."

01:16:22.662 --> 01:16:27.666
And l actually visited the boxes
in which Sue was located

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.085
in the South Dakota School of Mines

01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:33.922
with Maurice's family,
who had never actually been there.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:36.341
This was the first time
they'd actually seen Sue.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:39.928
What one really saw
inside that sort of garage area

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.680
was this extraordinary,

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:45.684
almost Citizen Kane vision
of boxes and boxes and boxes.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:48.979
Maurice and I had numerous conversations.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.439
We talked about the responsibility involved

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:54.651
in dealing with this extraordinary fossil.

01:16:54.735 --> 01:16:56.987
Nothing quite like it
had ever been sold before.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.863
lt had to go to the right place,

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:03.034
but adjudicating which place
was the right place was complicated,

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.037
and the auction process, in fact,
could help resolve that.

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:24.264
PETER: We're going into court.
We'd already had an indication

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:28.935
that the judge wasn't too pleased with us
because we asked him to recuse himself.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:35.191
lt was pretty clear that Judge Battey
was irritated by the defense.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.319
NEAL: We had to go back to the same tables

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:40.864
with our attorneys and sit there,
and then stand up

01:17:40.948 --> 01:17:43.325
as Judge Battey sentenced us.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:47.037
He also wanted to hear
that we were sorry for what we had done.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.420
DUFFY: For Peter Larson,

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:58.089
recommended guideline range

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:01.134
for the two felonies
of which he was convicted

01:18:01.218 --> 01:18:02.844
was zero to six months.

01:18:02.928 --> 01:18:07.557
lt really looked like the sentence
would be minimal, probably probation.

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:09.309
When he did come down with his sentence,

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:12.312
he enhanced it,
so instead of zero to six months,

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:15.940
he sentenced me to two years in prison
and two years probation.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:32.540
To send him to jail, to prison for two years
for this offense

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:36.294
was absolutely no justification for it.

01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:40.757
lndefensible, ugly behavior.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:44.177
This is justice? This is,
you know, the country we live in?

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.139
Every geographic photographer
in the last 30 years would be in jail.

01:18:48.224 --> 01:18:49.891
You know, you're coming back with $1 0,000.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.893
Well, you reported it going in.
You come back out.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.561
Do you report it?
No, because they're not countersigned.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:55.230
The reason the judge did is because

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:58.733
he had been urged,
he had been convinced by guys with PhDs

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:02.028
at university museums
that it had to be done,

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:06.616
for the safety of our science and
our fossils, and that was so totally wrong.

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.993
Peter Larson was made an example. . .

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:11.955
. . .with that sentence.

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:17.710
l don't have a real good recollection
of those. . .

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:22.507
Those next few hours,
l guess you might say.

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:25.593
FEMALE REPORTER: A federaljudge in
Rapid City today sentenced Peter Larson

01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:28.972
to two years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:31.182
Larson was found guilty last year of charges

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:34.185
connected to his commercial
fossil-hunting business in Hill City.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.438
lt's the final chapter in the case that began

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:39.732
with the discovery of Sue,
the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:39.501
PETER: l was to turn myself in at the gate,

01:20:39.585 --> 01:20:43.171
the same prison that
Timothy McVeigh was and John Gotti.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.965
And l was using a cane. l could barely walk.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:49.219
Just a few months before that,
broken my leg quite badly.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:52.388
When l surrendered at the gate,
they said, "We're gonna take your cane."

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:55.517
l said, "lf you take my cane,
l'm going to fall over."

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.894
Because l really couldn't
stand without my cane.

01:20:57.978 --> 01:20:59.437
DONNAN:
And they would say, "Well, let me see."

01:20:59.522 --> 01:21:02.690
And so he's stumbling around,
and it was pitiful.

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:06.486
lt was so insulting. l just felt so bad for him.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.321
And l was totally powerless.

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:09.906
There's nothing you can do.

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.742
PETER: She was not next to tears.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:14.327
She was way past that.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.205
l just. . . lt broke my heart.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:23.878
DONNAN: There was finally a time
when the man said, "Get out of here."

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.880
So l drove around him,

01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:28.883
and then l couldn't see him anymore.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.302
And the only choice you have
is to go out the driveway

01:21:31.387 --> 01:21:35.139
and turn on the desolate road

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:38.142
and drive 1 0 hours,

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:40.478
you know, home.

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:44.232
l think l screamed for about 1 0 minutes,

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:45.900
driving.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:49.404
lt was wild. l didn't have any other choice.

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:52.073
l had to get it out. lt was hard.

01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:56.828
lt was the hardest thing l ever did.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:58.246
Ever.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:01.874
The guard who was there
filling out the paperwork

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:03.376
said, "Have you seen this?"

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:05.128
And l said, "Seen what?" And he said,

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:08.131
"Come here."
And he looked at the piece of paper,

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:13.511
and it said, "Reason for incarceration,
failure to fill out forms."

01:22:13.804 --> 01:22:17.056
And he said, "Man, you must have
really pissed somebody off."

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.976
Prison was very surreal.

01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:03.186
Um...

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:09.484
The thing about prison
is not the fact that you're in prison,

01:23:09.568 --> 01:23:13.613
so much as you are kept
from your family and your friends.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.490
After a couple of weeks,

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:18.034
l said, "l have an idea.

01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:22.121
"They used to have a little thing here
that they called Saturday morning lectures

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:23.414
"and people who would give lectures.

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:26.668
"They aren't doing that anymore.
l'd like to start that up again.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.586
"We've got lawyers. We've got doctors.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.672
"We've got physical therapists.
We've got realtors.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.382
"We've got drug dealers, too,
and counterfeiters

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:34.008
"and all kinds of things like that,

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:36.010
"but these drug dealers,

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:39.389
"who've never had
a different job in their life,

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.557
"l think it would be helpful

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:43.685
"for them to learn
how to do these other things."

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.228
We went down there.
You have to get clearance,

01:23:45.312 --> 01:23:48.022
and, you know, it's like
you're surrounded by all these. . .

01:23:48.107 --> 01:23:51.484
You know, he's got a uniform with the,
you know, numbers on it and stuff.

01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:54.195
He says, "Well, l'm leading the debate club,

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.698
"and l have a paleontological club
that l'm working on.

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:59.534
"They have some great, you know,
minerals around here."

01:23:59.618 --> 01:24:03.037
He was teaching the prisoners
how to, you know, do paleontology

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:04.372
right there on the prison grounds.

01:24:04.456 --> 01:24:06.207
That's what it's like with Pete.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:08.376
l mean, he will find the beauty
in everything around him.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:11.295
DONNAN: The other inmates loved him,

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.715
and it was very clear
that they protected him.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:17.468
Not like in a movie,
where they beat people up for him,

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.721
but just they took care of him in some way,

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:22.557
like they just felt a proprietary interest

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.435
for him, like he was special,

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:29.522
and it was very sweet to see
that they saw who he was.

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:54.297
PETER: When finally the day came,

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:58.009
l'm riding all night long
on this bus that stops every five minutes.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.260
DONNAN: l couldn't go pick up Pete.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:01.304
He had to get on a bus, a public bus.

01:25:01.388 --> 01:25:03.306
PETER:
'Cause you're still technically in prison.

01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:05.099
l'm still serving my sentence.

01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:07.018
Riding in the bus,

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:10.021
even though it was driving all night long,

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:11.439
was great.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:20.740
lt was my first taste of freedom
for 1 8 months, where l'm out of this prison.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.788
And finally, in the morning of
the next day, I arrive in Rapid City.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:29.707
ZENKER: Kristin was standing there,
and she just told everybody,

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:33.461
"Stand back because
this is gonna take some time."

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:36.506
lt was great. lt was great. He was back home.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:40.051
l mean, he was under house arrest,
but he was back home. We could see him.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:42.512
PETER: Eventually l'm released
from the halfway house

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.556
to home confinement,
where l can only go from home to work,

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:47.600
so l get to walk across
the alley every morning

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:50.186
and across the alley
back home at night, and that's it.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:55.191
NEAL: When Pete got out of prison,
he was not the person he was when he left.

01:25:55.275 --> 01:25:59.195
He was very reclusive.
He was very withdrawn.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.656
DONNAN: He had to reorient

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:04.575
to normal interactions with people.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:08.454
The lnstitute was not the happy place
that it sometimes is.

01:26:08.539 --> 01:26:11.707
Things were a little gloomier. We didn't. . .

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:16.337
Still didn't know how the long-term
effects of this would leave us.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:18.840
We just had to keep plugging along

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:21.384
and try to cope as well as we could.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.444
PETER: While l was in prison,
Sue was also still in prison,

01:26:40.612 --> 01:26:42.154
and there were rumors

01:26:42.239 --> 01:26:44.866
that Sue was gonna be auctioned off
to the highest bidder.

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.787
HENDRlCKSON:
lt really was obvious to me by that time

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:51.581
that the only way to get her
away from Maurice Williams

01:26:51.665 --> 01:26:53.374
was through Sotheby's.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:56.878
All of us were aware that
the auction was taking place.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:59.505
lt would probably sell for $1 or $2 million.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:03.843
The big fear was that it was going to be
sold to some private individual.

01:27:03.927 --> 01:27:08.598
l know there were a lot of people
concerned that it might be bought

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:10.224
by an institution in a foreign country.

01:27:10.309 --> 01:27:11.809
That was a big concern with the media,

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:14.395
was that it was gonna be sold
and lost to science

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:17.481
and sold and
put in a private room someplace.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:22.320
We always felt an extraordinary obligation
to get this fossil to the right home.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:26.157
Clearly there were a lot
of really interested parties

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.743
that were hoping
and praying they had a shot.

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:32.663
We had dreams
after the auction started developing

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.749
that perhaps we could buy her back.

01:27:34.833 --> 01:27:38.252
A wonderful philanthropist
from our area, Stan Adelstein,

01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:40.880
really wanted to help
get Sue back to South Dakota.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:45.927
ln visiting with Pete,
l was fascinated with the possibility

01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:50.765
that we'd have this fantastic dinosaur
back in the state where she belonged.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:54.143
Stan came ready and willing to spend

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:56.270
1 .2 million of his own money.

01:27:56.355 --> 01:27:58.230
l just had hopes we could make it work.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:00.441
There's still hope
Sue will make it back home.

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.945
Stanford Adelstein will bid on Sue
and try to bring her home to the Black Hills.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:07.198
Sue, the dinosaur that goes
on the auction block tomorrow,

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.492
has traveled a rocky road
since she was found.

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:11.786
MALE REPORTER:
Right now, Larson's heart is broken.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:16.332
He's lost his most important find
and cannot even see her sold

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.751
because Larson is under house arrest.

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:20.211
And l'm still only on work release.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.671
So they asked me to go out there.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.714
So they flew me out to New York,

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:26.884
and l helped them, kind of,
unpack some of the bones.

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:28.761
REDDEN: So much was still in jackets.

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:31.305
We left those in jackets.
We thought that was,

01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:33.516
first of all,
the right thing to do scientifically,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.645
but also it looked fascinating,
absolutely fascinating,

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:39.689
and, of course, the centerpiece of it all

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:43.651
was that astonishing skull,
absolutely amazing.

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:46.237
PETER: Kristin and Stan Adelstein are there.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:47.655
They're going to try
to buy the dinosaur for us.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:49.365
And Terry Wentz is there, you know,

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:51.617
the guy who fought
for this dinosaur forever.

01:28:51.702 --> 01:28:52.910
Susan Hendrickson is there.

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:55.329
Everybody's anticipating this auction.

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:58.457
l'm thinking, "We have a chance.
We have a chance."

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:06.799
REDDEN: The day of the auction,

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:09.343
the place is
just absolutely full of excitement.

01:29:09.428 --> 01:29:12.263
Television cameras everywhere.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.724
A lot of reporters.
The room was completely full.

01:29:14.808 --> 01:29:17.727
WENTZ:
Maurice Williams was in a private room

01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:22.940
up above the auction area,
so he could watch everything going on.

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:25.526
PETER: Sotheby's had arranged
for one of the people

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:27.361
who would normally be taking bids

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.280
to give me a running detail on the telephone

01:29:29.364 --> 01:29:31.824
about what was happening at the auction.

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:33.617
NEAL: l was at the lnstitute, too.

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.327
l could not bear to listen to the phone.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:37.580

Sue's bones went on the auction block

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:29.210
at Sotheby's auction house in New York.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:31.212
Bidding started at 500,000

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:35.174
and ended at 7.6 million,
but totaled 8.4 million

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.218
after a fee to the auction house.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:40.054
McDonald's and the Walt Disney Company
helped foot the bill,

01:32:40.138 --> 01:32:43.224
and the Field Museum of Natural History
reaps the benefits.

01:32:43.308 --> 01:32:45.768
South Dakotans say
she should have stayed here.

Maurice Williams was there in the building,

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:12.503
and l glanced up at him, this man,
supported by our government

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:15.089
in receiving seven-point-whatever-it-was
million dollars,

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:20.261
but that fossil should have stayed
in her hometown museum.

01:33:20.679 --> 01:33:22.763
lf she wasn't going to be in Black Hills,

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:25.933
where she morally should be,
Field Museum was a good place.

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:28.811
REDDEN: This was just the kind of place

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:32.022
that we felt Sue had to go to.

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:35.025
SANTUCCl:
My reaction was relief that, that specimen

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:38.779
wound up where the public and the
scientific community will have access to it.

01:33:39.197 --> 01:33:42.241
l think it's, you know, probably
the second-best place she could have been.

01:33:42.325 --> 01:33:44.451
lt's going to go where millions of people
will see her.

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:46.912
She's not gonna be in prison anymore.

01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:49.290
Sue is free, and people can see her,

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:52.167
and they can get the same
excitement that l have for her

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:54.211
and they can love her just like l do.

still belongs in Hill City.

Pete's the kind of guy that can go out

01:34:13.648 --> 01:34:15.899
and then find
another half-a-dozen more T . rexes,

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:17.693
but there was only one Sue.

01:34:17.777 --> 01:34:20.821
ln your lifetime,
you don't hope to find something that good,

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:24.616
but we did, and it's still unbelievable to me.

finally, which, of course, you can imagine,

01:34:41.801 --> 01:34:47.139
Pete's most exciting moment,
to be able to be reunited with Sue.

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:48.974

and the negative of that,

but there's another negative.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:19.630
lt's the negative of what never happened
and what could have happened,

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:21.965

Chicago has a wonderful dinosaur.
They love it, but they don't love it

would have loved that dinosaur.
