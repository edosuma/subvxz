00:56.122 --> 00:58.249
[siren continues]

01:00.827 --> 01:02.317
[speaking German] Georg?

01:04.497 --> 01:06.488
Why are you still here?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.265
Paris is being sealed off.
You won’t get out.

01:09.335 --> 01:11.235
-And you?
-I leave tomorrow.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.566
-For where?
-Cassis.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.834
-Where’s that?
-Marsei||e.

01:15.108 --> 01:18.635
I’m shipping out.
I have a “danger” visa for the USA.

01:18.711 --> 01:21.680
-What’s that?
-A visa for people in great jeopardy.

01:21.748 --> 01:26.685
-[scoffs] You’re in great jeopardy?
-Come on!

01:26.753 --> 01:29.085
My articles? The newspaper?

01:32.625 --> 01:34.616
You could do me a big favor.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.558
There’s some money in it for you.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.867
-Deliver these two letters.
-Why don’t you do it?

01:47.140 --> 01:50.109
They’re for Weidel. You know. The writer.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.838
-The great writer. Once great...
-I don’t know him.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.638
| asked why you don’t
deliver them yourself.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.409
I tried.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.150
But the hotel owner was weird.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.120
You got scared?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.886
I’d say l was being cautious.

02:05.158 --> 02:08.150
-Who are the letters from?
-One is from his wife.

02:08.228 --> 02:10.491
-So, who cares?
-She seems to.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.131
The other is from the Mexican Consul.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.168
l was friends with Weidel.
We have the same publisher...

02:16.236 --> 02:17.897
When do | get my money?

02:18.872 --> 02:21.340
Once you’ve given him the letters.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.873
Hotel Ryad, room 6.
I’ll be waiting for you here.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.543
How will you make it to Cassis?

02:32.619 --> 02:34.143
[siren blaring]

02:41.427 --> 02:43.622
-You still letting Heinz drag you down?
-No.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.857
-Good.
-What’s good?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.597
We have a spare place in the car.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.261
But just the one.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.504
You coming?

02:56.276 --> 02:57.607
Yes.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.323
[Speaking French] Sorry...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.630
[metal clattering]

04:00.373 --> 04:03.536
-Why didn’t you wait downstairs?
-I rang the bell.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.906
-I didn’t hear it.
-Apparently not.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.444
I’m looking for a room.

04:10.516 --> 04:14.646
-Show me your papers, please.
-Show me a room, please.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.821
Take your pick.
There are hardly any guests.

04:17.890 --> 04:19.687
Maybe you can advise me.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.721
With a little morning sun...

04:22.795 --> 04:25.821
nice and quiet, with birds in the garden.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.727
Are you German?
From the occupying authorities?

04:33.673 --> 04:37.905
All guests are registered,
l was checked just two weeks back.

04:37.977 --> 04:41.674
A little morning sun and birds
in the garden, please, Fraulein.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.383
Please wait.
I’ll get a key from downstairs.

04:51.658 --> 04:56.391
Number 16, it’s a nice room, my nicest...
two large windows facing south.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.972
You can’t imagine the trouble
the man caused me.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.774
He came on the evening ofthe15th,
just after the occupation.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.338
I hadn’t shut my hotel, l’d stayed.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.919
My father always said not
to abandon property or it’d be destroyed.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.124
Monsieur Weidel came to me.

06:04.397 --> 06:06.922
He was trembling like a leaf,
I found it odd.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.394
When I gave him the form,
he asked if he could stay offthe books.

06:11.471 --> 06:15.373
As you know, Mr. Langeron
still insists on registering all aliens.

06:15.441 --> 06:16.965
Order must be maintained.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.567
Right?

06:18.911 --> 06:21.573
This guy made a fuss
about his registration.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.138
He and his wife had already
stayed in this room.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.975
They loved it.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.411
And when it comes down to love...

06:30.490 --> 06:31.889
| just melt.

06:32.892 --> 06:36.089
That’s just how I am.
A Frenchwoman through and through.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.392
Only the one night is what I said.

06:38.464 --> 06:42.594
He doesn’t come down the next day.
So I open up with the night key.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.693
And find this filthy mess.

06:46.105 --> 06:48.903
He was lying already stiff
in his own blood.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.840
He’d slashed his wrists.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.914
So where is he now?

07:00.486 --> 07:04.047
I know someone at Saint-Sulpice Police.
He took care of things:

07:04.123 --> 07:07.684
Unknown corpse,
crematorium, unmarked grave.

07:09.495 --> 07:12.658
He caused me more trouble
than the occupation.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.566
What do you want to do with all this?

07:19.138 --> 07:20.969
Would you like to take it?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.510
| just want things to be in order.

07:52.605 --> 07:53.867
Your papers.

09:13.185 --> 09:14.880
[knocking]

09:19.859 --> 09:21.554
[in French] It’s me.

09:24.864 --> 09:28.891
-Where were you? We were worried.
-Claire! What are you doing?

09:28.968 --> 09:32.335
-They’ll come and find the room.
-We’ll say it’s Jean’s game.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.773
His secret room. He always wanted one.

09:37.843 --> 09:41.176
[man moaning]

09:41.247 --> 09:43.215
The marzipan.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.113
I promised it to the boy.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.950
Melissa’s in Marseille with the kid.
He rests, then you make for the hills.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.682
He won’t make it!

09:50.756 --> 09:53.816
I obtained morphine
and three jabs of penicillin.

09:53.893 --> 09:56.726
-Claire packed his bags.
-[Georg] He won’t make it, I say.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.993
-[muttering, indistinct]
-They’re going house to house.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.966
The neighbors husband is with the police.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.333
She saw the cubbyhole today.
She’ll report it. They’ll be right here.

10:05.871 --> 10:09.238
They’ve set up a camp at the Velodrome.
They’re scouring the district.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.839
They call it spring cleaning.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.641

10:27.259 --> 10:29.625
Son of a bitch.

10:56.022 --> 11:00.049
I got a skeleton key for the door.
The trip will take four days plus, okay?

11:00.126 --> 11:02.321
You can open the shutters on the way.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.694
To get some light and fresh air.

11:06.032 --> 11:10.264
But keep them closed at every stop.
You mustn’t be spotted. Okay?

11:13.072 --> 11:15.097
When you get to Melissa’s...

11:15.174 --> 11:17.074
you wait a few days,

11:17.143 --> 11:19.805
and then head out to Henry in the hills.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.972
-How am | to...
-You help him.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.280
You’re going to help them.

11:31.123 --> 11:33.853

F/ha//y he had opened the wr/z‘er’s bag.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.085
He began to read out of pure boredom.

-Just goalie!

-How exactly would that work?
-Are you German?

20:23.455 --> 20:24.717
Can you hear it?

20:24.790 --> 20:27.657
Now, it’s only
that they love their goalies.

20:28.927 --> 20:32.226
-I don’t know about that.
-But they’re good, anyway.

And you, are you any good?

20:38.537 --> 20:39.401
Yes.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.268
Really good?

20:41.340 --> 20:43.001
Yes. Really good.

21:16.575 --> 21:18.600
How come I didn’t just score?

21:18.677 --> 21:22.636

-And how do I do that?
-You go to the police station

24:06.645 --> 24:09.637
and show them your visa

24:10.015 --> 24:11.505
So...

24:11.583 --> 24:13.847
I can only stay here if...

24:14.586 --> 24:18.022

But no. They’re afraid.

[in French]
Yes.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.888
[in German] Why didn’t you try
to get a visa for the United States?

46:39.897 --> 46:41.888
Many of your colleagues did.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.492
You were afraid your application
for a visa would be rejected.

46:49.106 --> 46:50.869
Am I right?

46:52.042 --> 46:54.067
The series of articles in the NewFront/er

46:54.144 --> 46:57.978
about the shooting of unionists
in Almeria with the help ofthe ClA.

46:59.516 --> 47:01.245
You had a part in it.

47:02.586 --> 47:04.110
No.

47:06.957 --> 47:09.289
The NewFront/er is a communist paper.

47:10.561 --> 47:12.461
I had no part in it.

47:19.269 --> 47:21.032
Why Mexico?

47:21.104 --> 47:25.200
-You think they welcome communists?
-I said I had no part in it.

47:25.275 --> 47:26.867
What draws you to Mexico?

47:27.511 --> 47:29.445
What will you live from?

47:30.113 --> 47:32.274
I’ll try to practice a trade.

47:38.889 --> 47:40.857
What trade would that be?

47:41.258 --> 47:43.089
Radio and TV technician.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.194
-You don’t want to write about all this?
-No.

47:49.933 --> 47:51.901
But it’s what writers do.

47:57.407 --> 47:59.068
When I was a small boy,

47:59.643 --> 48:02.134
I often went on school outings.

48:03.247 --> 48:05.078
Some were great.

48:05.415 --> 48:07.007
But unfortunately...

48:07.084 --> 48:11.214
the next day our teacher
would have us write an essay:

48:11.288 --> 48:12.983
“Our School Trip.”

48:15.025 --> 48:18.085
And after the holidays,
there was always an essay:

48:19.062 --> 48:21.155
“What I did on Holiday.”

48:21.665 --> 48:25.294
Or “The Best Part ofthe Holidays.”

48:28.338 --> 48:32.035
And even after Christmas,
the presents and festivities,

48:32.576 --> 48:34.510
there’d always be the essay:

48:35.178 --> 48:36.509
“My Christmas.”

48:38.215 --> 48:41.207
At some point it felt like
I was experiencing it all

48:41.285 --> 48:43.617
just to write a school essay about it.

48:45.522 --> 48:48.457
And for all the writers
who were with me in the camps,

48:48.525 --> 48:52.086
all the terrifying and horrific events

48:52.162 --> 48:55.131
were only material for their writing.

48:56.099 --> 48:58.431
The camp. The escape.

48:59.269 --> 49:00.964
Death.

49:01.371 --> 49:02.702
The war.

49:08.979 --> 49:11.675
I won’t be writing any more school essays.

49:14.484 --> 49:17.612
That’s a weighty confession
from a man such as you.

49:24.127 --> 49:27.961

49:28.031 --> 49:30.056

49:35.072 --> 49:36.733

50:29.393 --> 50:31.088
Want something else?

50:34.631 --> 50:36.599
Do you want to leave?

50:37.601 --> 50:39.535
For America?

50:41.538 --> 50:43.062
For Mexico.

50:44.641 --> 50:46.268
When?

50:46.343 --> 50:48.038
On the 23rd.

50:48.645 --> 50:50.510
Aboard the Montrea/.

50:53.483 --> 50:56.680
We could have ice cream somewhere else.
At the port, say.

50:58.422 --> 51:00.356
Hmm?

51:00.424 --> 51:03.120
Or we go work on your support leg.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.360
[narrator] And then he not/ced
that the boy was cry/ng

51:07.431 --> 51:10.127
And how he was try/ng
to ho/d back the tears.

51:11.234 --> 51:12.462
l have to flee.

51:12.536 --> 51:15.733
He saw the exert/on and wanted
to embrace and conso/e the boy,

51:15.806 --> 51:18.172
exp/a/n to him why he had to /ea ve.

-[siren blaring]

52:23.740 --> 52:25.605
He didn’t make it.

52:26.309 --> 52:27.708
Can you buy me a meal?

52:28.812 --> 52:31.508
-Sorry?
-Can you buy me a meal?

52:33.283 --> 52:36.377
The dogs are eating me
out of house and home, I’m broke.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.755
I thought the vet’s certificate
would come sooner...

52:39.823 --> 52:41.313
Wait here.

52:45.295 --> 52:48.924
[narrator] The woman had given me a note.
She was apparent/y deaf and dumb.

52:49.699 --> 52:51.394
[in French]
I’ll go...

52:51.468 --> 52:54.767
[narrator] Many refugees try to earn
a //tt/e money with such th/ngs.

52:54.838 --> 52:58.239
They put notes and //tt/e toys
on the customers’ tab/es

52:58.308 --> 52:59.707
and ask for a donation.

53:00.610 --> 53:03.374
But th/s woman was /ook/ng
for a doctor for her son,

53:03.446 --> 53:05.914
and hoped to ﬁnd one among the Germans.

53:06.583 --> 53:10.349
And or?“ he went
He asked around among the refugees.

53:10.420 --> 53:13.719
He very qu/ck/y found a doctor
In a hotel at the port.

53:14.691 --> 53:16.659
A ped/atr/c/an from Kassel

53:17.861 --> 53:19.351
-[in French] Hello.
-Yes?

53:19.462 --> 53:21.692
I understand there’s a doctor here.

53:22.632 --> 53:23.792
One second.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.898
[in German]
It’s for you.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.977
-[in German] We urgently need a doctor.
-Who is we?

53:43.253 --> 53:45.483
A boy. About eight years old.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.523
-What’s wrong?
-I don’t know.

53:48.858 --> 53:52.521
-He’s having trouble breathing.
-Why not go to the emergency room?

53:52.596 --> 53:55.360
He’s illegal. He and his mother.

53:55.765 --> 53:58.734
-And you are not?
-No, I am, too.

54:00.937 --> 54:03.235
-Is it far?
-Ten minutes.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.704
One second, I’ll get my bag.

54:14.317 --> 54:16.410
-[whispering] I’ll see you later.
-Yes.

54:30.333 --> 54:32.563
-Was it something he ate?
-I don’t know.

54:34.704 --> 54:36.899
I haven’t seen him since yesterday.

54:40.543 --> 54:42.010
I’m not his father.

54:42.846 --> 54:44.711
He’s a friend’s son.

54:47.717 --> 54:50.413
The friend died. Not long ago.

54:54.391 --> 54:56.916
-His mother is deaf and dumb.
-What’s the boy’s name?

54:56.993 --> 54:59.018
-Driss.
-An African?

54:59.796 --> 55:02.458
Melissa, his mother, is from the Maghreb.

55:04.301 --> 55:05.791
Driss is asthmatic.

55:08.605 --> 55:11.597
[doctor’s voice, muffled]
Try to breathe deep into your stomach.

55:15.845 --> 55:17.779
You can get dressed again.

55:19.049 --> 55:21.415
Were you outside a lot recently?

55:24.020 --> 55:26.511
You have to spend a few days here in bed.

55:27.590 --> 55:29.854
Tell your mother
to make you something good.

55:31.094 --> 55:33.460
Do you have a favorite dish?

55:33.530 --> 55:37.489
No, there must be something
you particularly like, right?

55:38.568 --> 55:40.695
Pancakes, maybe?

55:42.939 --> 55:46.102
Maybe your mother can make you some.

55:47.977 --> 55:49.501
l’ll fetch her.

55:51.114 --> 55:51.978
[door opens]

55:53.350 --> 55:54.840
Would you come here?

56:00.023 --> 56:01.786
Only his mother.

56:07.397 --> 56:09.558
[doctor’s voice, muffled]
He’s had a bad attack of asthma.

56:09.632 --> 56:10.758
He has to remain in bed.

56:12.035 --> 56:15.664
These are some drops to be taken
three times daily after meals.

56:15.739 --> 56:17.707
The Mistral is not good for him.

56:17.774 --> 56:20.368
[Driss]
Mama and l are going to the mountains.

56:20.443 --> 56:22.104
[doctor]
The mountains will do you good.

56:22.946 --> 56:25.813
-What did you do to the boy?
-Excuse me?

56:26.883 --> 56:30.148
You must have done something
for him to refuse to see you...

56:31.588 --> 56:33.613
or even let you into his room.

56:40.430 --> 56:42.057
I’m leaving him behind.

56:43.566 --> 56:46.034
-You aren’t going into the mountains?
-No.

56:46.736 --> 56:49.967
And he’d hoped you’d go with them
in his father’s place.

56:56.146 --> 56:58.546
And why aren’t you going with them?

56:59.115 --> 57:00.878
I’m leaving for Mexico.

57:06.055 --> 57:07.579
What?

57:10.760 --> 57:12.091
What?

57:12.796 --> 57:14.627
I want to go there, too.

57:14.697 --> 57:16.187
So why don’t you?

57:18.067 --> 57:21.503
-Are you still missing documents?
-No, I’ve got them all.

57:22.138 --> 57:24.663
-When does your ship sail?
-On Tuesday.

57:26.209 --> 57:27.972
So what is the problem?

57:31.448 --> 57:33.712
l have to leave someone behind, too.

57:34.484 --> 57:36.475
-Who?
-A woman.

57:41.991 --> 57:43.788
May | buy you a meal?

57:47.797 --> 57:50.129
We could have gotten away
three weeks back.

57:50.667 --> 57:54.228
You didn’t need a damn visa
or transit back then.

57:56.105 --> 57:58.869
It was all arranged,
I had the ship passages.

58:01.578 --> 58:04.979
We were almost gone, the anchor
was being weighed, as they say.

58:06.883 --> 58:08.612
Then she disembarked

58:09.552 --> 58:10.917
and I followed.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.046
And now you can’t leave.

58:17.227 --> 58:18.854
I can.

58:18.928 --> 58:21.590
l have a visa.
The transits. And a passage.

58:24.801 --> 58:28.134
The Esperanza sails on Tuesday.
At 21 :00 hours, from wharftwelve.

58:28.204 --> 58:31.731
-Via Lisbon and Montevideo.
-[pop music on car stereo]

58:31.808 --> 58:34.777
I got the transits
for Portugal and Uruguay today.

58:35.078 --> 58:37.103
And you will embark?

58:37.180 --> 58:39.273
This will go to hell in two weeks.

58:39.549 --> 58:41.915
They’re already in Lyon,
as you probably know.

58:41.985 --> 58:44.044
And you mean to leave her behind?

58:52.161 --> 58:55.028
l have to set up a hospital.
They’re expecting me.

58:57.600 --> 59:00.068
It’s myjob. I can’t wait any longer.

59:00.870 --> 59:03.703
-And does she know?
-I told her.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.239
l have to go. People in need are waiting.

59:09.312 --> 59:11.542
-She knows it.
-| see.

59:14.717 --> 59:15.911
You see?

59:16.719 --> 59:18.710
Yes. | see.

59:19.722 --> 59:22.714
You have a bad conscience
and want my blessing.

59:25.228 --> 59:29.096
[footsteps passing]

59:29.165 --> 59:32.623
I doubt you’re capable
of giving blessings.

59:32.702 --> 59:35.296
-Or even comfort.
-[footsteps continue]

59:46.816 --> 59:48.306
Did you find him?

59:56.826 --> 59:59.226
-Here. Have a bite to eat.
-Thanks.

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.625
Go on.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.968
You’re the man who needed a doctor.

01:00:08.037 --> 01:00:10.904
Yes... I am.

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.176
The gentleman here has made up his mind.

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.179
He’s going to Mexico
and leaving a little boy here.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.770
What the hell?

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:23.177
You made your decision.
Or am I missing something?

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.880
You love the boy, it’s obvious.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:30.089
I noticed how hurt you were
when he wouldn’t have you in his room.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:35.356
-You love him yet you’re abandoning him.
-He is not my son.

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:39.191
What difference does that make?
She is not my wife.

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.818

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.970
The doctor seemed to be cry/ng

01:01:42.965 --> 01:01:44.455
[Marie] Yes?

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.065
It’s Georg.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:49.429
From yesterday evening.

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.375
He isn’t here.

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:01.974
-Hmm.
-You can wait. He’ll be back soon.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.264
-Tea?
-Gladly.

01:02:25.975 --> 01:02:28.500
-Where is he, then?
-He went back to the boy.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.406
Has something happened to Driss?

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.247
No. He’s just double-checking.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:41.448
He’s a good doctor. A great one.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:49.395
Do you know a good second-hand shop
in Marseille?

01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:52.798
-What are you looking for?
-Nothing. I’m selling.

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:55.868
Have you run out of money?

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.304
That, too.

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:07.209
He might be late.

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:11.244
He will probably go
and confirm his passage, too.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.947
So he’s leaving?

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:14.512
Yes. He really is.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.955
And you’re staying?

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:21.160
What choice do l have?

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:23.362
Do you want to leave?

01:03:26.369 --> 01:03:29.827
He told me you almost left once.
What was it he said?

01:03:30.973 --> 01:03:34.136
The anchor had been weighed
as she disembarked.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.201
-Or something like that.
-Yes.

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.838
But now you would stay on board?

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.349
What changed?

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:45.317
Everything.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.326
Who is the first to forget:

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:57.560
he who is left, or she who left him?

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:02.060
What do you think?

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:07.101
-He has forgotten me.
-Who?

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.043
My husband.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:13.047
How do you know?

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.177
The Consul told me.

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:18.352
What Consul?

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.454
The Mexican one.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:26.159
-[narrator] Had he suspected it?
-I said we had to go.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:30.859
-He sat with her, //stened..
-He was smoking, writing, drinking.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:33.333
as she to/d how she ’d /e/t her husband ..

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:36.633
-The Germans were at the city gates.
In Par/s,

-and had got Into the doctor’s car
-...I met him there.

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:44.973
-And ﬂed the Germans.
-It was easy to get in the car with him,

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:48.141
and to write my husband a good-bye letter.

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.082
A final one.

01:04:50.152 --> 01:04:53.610
- She ’d /ooked for him In Marse/Y/e. ..
-And he’s here.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.621
at the Mex/can Consu/ate,
In front of the Amer/can one.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.361
On the Oaneb/ere.

01:04:59.962 --> 01:05:01.259
At the Mont l/entoux

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.931
Her desperate, po/nt/ess search.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:12.037
I’ve been looking ever since.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:15.077
-And everyone had just seen h/'m.
had just seen him.

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.237
-At the Western Un/on.
-The Mexican...

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:22.080
- The Amer/can Consu/, the Mex/can one.
-|’m always too late.

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:29.014
[Marie] They say that those who were left
never forget. But it’s not true.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:33.151
They have the sweet, sad songs.
Pity is with them.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.090
Those who leave, no one is with them.

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.367
They have no songs.

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.366
[Georg] Marie!

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.500
He did not forget you.

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:51.007
He’s hiding from me.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.613
Why did you disembark back then?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.274
[sighs]

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.344
Did you want to go back to him?

01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:03.116
I don’t know.

01:06:07.496 --> 01:06:09.657
Why are you looking for him, then?

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.395
He has my visa.

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:17.233
-I can’t get away without him.
-[ship horn blaring, distant]

01:06:17.306 --> 01:06:21.265
I wrote him a letter, an acquaintance
brought it to him in Paris.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:25.044
In it I wrote
that he should come to Marseille,

01:06:25.614 --> 01:06:27.411
that our visas are here.

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:31.150
He received the letter.

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.352
I know he did.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.463
Do you love the doctor?

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.203
[exhales]

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.270
[sniffles]

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:02.173
[sighs]

01:07:15.464 --> 01:07:20.458
[sniffles, sobs]

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.698
I will take care of you.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.778
Who are you?

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:47.556
[keys jangle, turn in lock]

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:51.361
[door opens]

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:01.804
-[doctor] What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:04.572
Ah, yes?

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.524
The boy is feeling better.
The cortisone has taken effect.

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:24.863
He’ll be playing again
in two or three days.

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:27.399
You bought rucksacks.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.738
And hiking boots.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:33.331
What you’re planning is insane.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:37.506
-And what am | planning?
-You mean to cross the Pyrenees with her.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.546
Have you already sold your passage?

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.749
Have you already sold your passage?

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:06.832
I can get Marie a visa
and a passage to Mexico.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:12.774
You can go ahead.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:16.613
I’ll follow you with Marie.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.912
On the 23rd. Aboard the Montrea/.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:26.394
Do tell us how much you want.
Five thousand?

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:29.756
But let’s say
you’ll need two thousand in advance.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.198
You have functionaries to bribe.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.898
But you have great contacts,
were lucky to have met you.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:37.502
I don’t want a thing.

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.201
That answer makes you less plausible.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:43.868
Now please leave.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.813
I need Marie’s date of birth and so on.

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:51.881
We meet at Mont Ventoux at 2:00 pm.

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.218
I’ll bring the visa and passage.

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:04.930
[narrator] He sa/d he /ooked through
the W/I70’0W and saw Mar/e and R/chard ..

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:09.802
and then she had /ooked up
as If she knew he was stand/ng there,

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.464
and she sm/Yed

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.473
Later they sat together

01:10:16.445 --> 01:10:18.936
-Visa, passage.
-He had the v/sa and the passage,

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:22.582
and R/chard was m/strustfu/
and went to the port author/t/es

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.846
to have the passage checked

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.378
-|’m having this checked.
-Yes. Do that.

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:44.769
The two of them sat there and wa/ted

They ordered pizza and W/ne.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:18.398
And ce/ebrated pro v/s/ona//y,
as R/chard put /t,

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:21.841
because the trans/ts for Spa/n
and the US were st/7/ m/ss/ng

01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:25.038
-When does your ship sail?
-On the 23rd.

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:29.714
-Ofthis month?
-I doubt there’ll be a ship next month.

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:34.880
You should have applied
for your wife’s transit at once.

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:39.391
-It will be very tricky...
-Just enter her in the section marked:

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:42.862
“Person accompanying
the transit-applicant”.

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.491
Are you telling me how to do myjob?

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.461
You are peculiar.

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:53.670
For wanting to emigrate with my wife?

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:55.869
You didn’t want to a few days ago.

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:58.412
You spoke of real work

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.415
and the parasitic nature of writers.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.041
How it repulses you.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.547
And now you speak to me oftrue love?

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:13.888
The two of you in Mexico,
a little house, a garden.

01:12:14.596 --> 01:12:17.497
You come back from work, and your wife,

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.625
whom I had the pleasure to meet

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.664
and who is extremely gracious...

01:12:24.106 --> 01:12:25.869
she’ll be sitting there...

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.636
chopping herbs for dinner.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.942
You’ll watch her sitting there

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:35.882
-among the bushes playing in the wind...
-Perhaps you should be the writer.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:08.607
You’ll be able to collect the documents
in a few days on production ofthis.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:11.746
Thanks.

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.524
One last question.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.554
What was the last thing you wrote?

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:28.728
[train rattling on rails]

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.873
[Georg] A man had died.

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.142
He was to register in hell.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:43.742
He waited in front of a large door.

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.053
He waited a day, two.

01:13:47.122 --> 01:13:50.683
He waited weeks. Months. Then years.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.993
Finally a man walked past him.

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.757
The man waiting addressed him,

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:59.096
“Perhaps you can help me.
I’m supposed to register in hell.”

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:03.832
The other man looks him up and down, says,

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:06.773
“But sir, this here is hell.”

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:16.777
[narrator] R/chard d/dn’t want her
to accompany him to the sh/p,

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.717

R/chard shook Georg’s hand,

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:29.620
then he/d the door for Mar/e
as If/t were she who was /eav/ng.

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:37.637
He to/d me that he then went upsta/rs
to wa/t for Mar/e.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:43.167
The bott/e of wme they’d drunk
by way of fare we// was st/7/ on the table.

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:46.842
He sat down, drank aga/n a/one.

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:49.679
He smoked He wa/ted

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.777
He went to the W/I70’0W Opened /t

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.789

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:46.364
For what?

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.195
What are you sorry for?

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.372
I’m not coming with you.

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:03.716
I can’t go with you. I’m staying here.

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.714
So what was the point of all this?

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:14.853
I wanted Richard to sail.

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:17.255
He has to go to Mexico.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.094
And you?

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.130
I’m searching for my husband.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.372
Marie, your husband is dead.

01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:03.734
No.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:26.361
[narrator] He sa/d that R/chard
had a/ready been onboard

when a group of French o/f/cers
had c/a/med the cab/ns for themse/ves

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.264
and he and a few others
were forced to disembark

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:37.070
He had /istened to Richard
and his depressing story.

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:40.745
Marie had sat down with Richard
to conso/e him.

01:18:40.816 --> 01:18:43.979
He was inconso/ab/e, comp/ete/y destroyed

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:46.885
He, Georg

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:51.289
it seemed to him that
he had been standing there a// evening

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:55.827
He had /e/t at some point
Le/t them there on the bed

He cou/dn ’t remember
how he had taken his /ea ve.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:03.771
He had /ooked at Marie once more.
He said she didn ’2‘ return his gaze.

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:08.001
Then he had wa/ked through the night,
f/na/iy gone to his hotei

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:12.140
There he /ay and thought
that in a few days he wou/d be gone.

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.380

[in French]
I’m looking for Melissa and Driss.

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:10.162
But this is their apartment?

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.865
They’re gone.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.903
-Where did they go?
-Far away.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.472

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.330

They’re dead.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:52.899
-|’m sorry. ldidn’t know...
-I don’t want a conversation.

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:59.344
I simply want to eat and drink

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:05.347
[narrator] He said that she
had him ro// her a cigarette,

[woman] Rudy Ricciotti was the architect...

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.618
And that they did speak alter a//,
about an architect,

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.164
Ricciotti

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:22.226
whose footbridge so br/i/iant/y connects
the Panier district with the o/d fort.

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.662
Of how she ’d /ooked forward
to being in Marse/i/e because of it

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.069
[woman continues, indistinct]

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:33.478
and the blocks he had coated
with patterned concrete.

01:22:33.548 --> 01:22:37.416
From the inside you can see out
through them. It’s beautiful.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.119
Can I have one, too?

01:22:59.607 --> 01:23:01.336
[narrator]
They smoked together

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:05.505
He said how he fe/t
so at ease in that moment,

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.641
he cou/d forget Marie,
everything was quiet and c/ear

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:11.743
[strikes match]

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:27.492

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:55.091
[narrator] He spent the /ast days,
olten /ay/ng there in his room, waiting.

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:57.791
He said that a// he now wanted
was to be gone.

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:01.658
He on/y went out at night

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:07.268
He saw Richard once,
who seemed comp/ete/y desperate.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.407
He said he hid //ke a co ward

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:14.347
He said he was afraid of meeting Marie.

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:21.314
Then he packed

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.384
/t was the /ast evening

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:26.723
The fo//o Wing alternoon

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:22.679
[Marie] At last I’ve found you.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:26.178
[narrator]
Everyone turned to /ook at them.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:30.418
This passionate embrace seemed to make
my patrons a /itt/e aggressive.

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:35.319
Fo/k don ’t //ke other peop/e ’s /o y
when the y’re sulter/ng misfortune.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:42.625
The mood in the Mont l/entoux was somber

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:46.531
A vignon was just being c/eansed,
as they ca// it

01:25:47.475 --> 01:25:50.501
The camps were fu//
and the deportations beginning

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:53.274
Now they were advancing to wards Marse/i/e.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:58.409
He /ater to/d me she repeated/y whispered
that he shou/d take her with him.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:02.623
That she had been so afraid
she might not find him anymore.

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:09.220
Then they went to his,
she didn ’2‘ want to go back to hers.

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:13.165
She a/ready had everything,
she said, pointing at her trave/ bag

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.267
I am so thirsty.

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.501
| only have water.

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:24.938
That’s fine.

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:29.645
[narrator] He said she sat beside him
on the bed, exhausted,

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.651
and asked for a g/ass of water

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.614
Later, in front of the bathroom mirror,

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:37.749
he again thought of
the unfortunate writer, her husband,

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:40.692
and wanted to te// her everything

01:26:45.967 --> 01:26:49.266
When he went back in,
he found her /y/ng on the bed

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:53.198
He /ooked at her,
so ca/m and gent/e and peacefui

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.571
/t was the first time
he ’0’ seen her //ke that

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:01.510
She must’ve been wa/k/ng about
for days and nights on end

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:06.519
Day broke, they had to go to the consu/ate
and then quick/y embark

01:27:06.588 --> 01:27:09.523
[metal door clangs]

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:20.292
I’ll be right back.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:29.676
[narrator] He said that
he didn ’t doubt for a moment

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:32.770
that he wou/d get the documents in time.

01:27:33.548 --> 01:27:37.279
They st/i/ had three hours
before the ship was to sail

01:27:37.352 --> 01:27:40.981
He saw Marie down there,
the morning sun was fa///ng on the corner,

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:43.451
and she was shie/d/ng her eyes
with a hand

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:46.357
-[woman in English] Mr. Weidel.
-Sudden/y he remembered Driss,

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:49.328
- who had sat there, too...
-[woman] Mr. Weidel!

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.262
in front of an ice cream
he hadn ’t touched

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:54.495
-[in French] Yes.
- Then his name was ca//ed

01:27:56.004 --> 01:27:57.767
[Georg] Marie!

01:28:07.649 --> 01:28:09.048
[horn honks]

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:13.049
Hey! [whistles]

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:28.465
[Georg] To the port, please.

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.409
[chuckles]

01:28:36.477 --> 01:28:39.071
It’s like going Christmas shopping
in New York.

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.577
-You’ve been to New York?
-Yes.

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.051
He bought me the coat there.

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.344
-Richard?
-No, my husband.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:55.895
He’ll be standing at the railing
and looking back at the harbor.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:58.363
He sits backwards on trains, too.

01:28:58.433 --> 01:28:59.991
-Yes. . .
-Yes!

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.370
What railing?

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.838
The ship’s one.

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.906
What ship?

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.603
Our ship. The Montreai.

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.572
What makes you think
he’ll be aboard the Montreai?

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.716
The Mexican told me.

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:23.514
You went back to the Consulate?

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.423
lmagine his face...

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:32.397
when he’s standing at the railing,

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:35.698
and l whisper his name
and he turns round to me.

01:29:37.605 --> 01:29:40.005
He won’t be standing at the railing.

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:41.507
He will.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:43.570
He’ll be there.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.607
And he’ll forgive me.

01:29:47.382 --> 01:29:50.146
I know him. He’ll laugh and forgive me.

01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:57.657
Hmm?

01:29:58.793 --> 01:30:00.658
You’ll like him.

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:31.754
This is your passage.

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:35.119
And...

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:39.759
You still have to fill in the number here.

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:41.631
This is the transit.

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.695
-Okay?
-Thanks.

01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:47.737
Take care of it.

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.549
[in French] Pull over, please.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.621
[Marie] What’s wrong?

01:31:08.162 --> 01:31:09.754
| forgot something.

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:12.588

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:15.901
-Is it important?
-|’|l be right there.

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:24.968
[keys jingling]

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:48.530

01:31:48.636 --> 01:31:49.728
Hello?

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:52.997
Hello...

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.217
Richard?

01:32:12.226 --> 01:32:14.091
What is it you want now?

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:17.992
-Shouldn’t you be embarking?
-l have a passage for you.

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:24.938
Pack only bare essentials.

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.701
I don’t understand.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:31.670
[narrator]
He said that Richard had stared at him

01:32:31.746 --> 01:32:35.182
and he knew he ’0’ have to make up
a story pretty quick

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:39.948
