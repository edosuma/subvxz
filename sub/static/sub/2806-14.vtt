00:06.131 --> 00:07.297
Happy birthday!

00:07.507 --> 00:08.632
Happy birthday!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.345
- Rach, come on.
- Come on.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.972
It's your birthday.

00:15.807 --> 00:16.849
Hey.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.645
She's not as pretty as she was
when she was 29.

00:22.772 --> 00:27.443
Ms. Green wants to establish
some ground rules before she comes out.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.988
She would appreciate it if you didn't
use the words "old" or "downhill"...

00:31.239 --> 00:33.741
...or "They still look pretty damn good."

00:37.829 --> 00:39.038
They do.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.124
Rachel, come on out.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.251
Monica made breakfast.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.878
Chocolate chip pancakes.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.297
We've got presents.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.259
Good ones?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.680
They all came from the list
you handed out to us two weeks ago.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.768
Well, can I keep the presents
and still be 29?

01:01.352 --> 01:05.022
Come on, Rach, look,
turning 30 is not that big a deal.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.025
Oh, really? Is that how you felt
when you turned 30?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.194
Why, God, why?

01:10.862 --> 01:15.199
We had a deal.
Let the others grow old, not me.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.662
Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me?
Am I overreacting?

01:20.872 --> 01:25.542
No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th
birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.836
And now Chandler.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.715
We're all getting so old.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.510
Why are you doing this to us?

02:17.470 --> 02:22.099
Rach, you're in a great place in your life.
You have an amazing job, good friends.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.476
Your roommate's a soap opera star.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.562
Your character is in a coma.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.775
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna cry at this one.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.905
I know my life's going pretty well,
but I see so many people...

02:37.157 --> 02:40.576
...who've accomplished so many
of their goals by the time they're 30.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.579
Yeah, but you shouldn't
compare yourself to me.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.999
- Come on, Phoebe.
- You can do it.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.459
Come on. There you go.

02:55.967 --> 02:59.678
I did it.
One mile on a Hippity Hop.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.015
That's it. That's everything I wanted to do
before I was 30.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.101
Oh, except I wanted to
patch things up with my sister.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.519
Oh, well. But, yay!

03:09.522 --> 03:13.192
And, girls, this thing is a godsend,
if you know what I mean. Heh.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.121
Come on, let's have some fun, huh?
What do you want to do today?

03:26.414 --> 03:28.165
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.

03:28.374 --> 03:33.337
Doing nothing on your 30th is better
than doing something stupid, like Ross.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.423
Hey, that was a practical purchase.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.635
I needed that car for transportation.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.012
Okay? I have a child.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.641
How hot do I look in this, huh?

03:46.476 --> 03:48.018
Ross, a sports car?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.563
Wouldn't it be cheaper
to just stuff a sock down there?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.483
That's not what this is about, okay?

03:54.734 --> 03:56.985
I am a sports car enthusiast.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.948
- I've always been into cars.
- What's the horsepower on this thing?

04:01.449 --> 04:03.742
I don't know, but look how shiny.

04:06.162 --> 04:09.915
- I can't believe you bought this.
- So can I have a ride, stud?

04:10.208 --> 04:11.583
Hop in.

04:12.919 --> 04:17.339
Get ready for the smoothest ride
of your life.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.239
Damn it.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.993
Okay, who's next?

04:48.913 --> 04:51.206
You know what?
I am gonna do something today.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.375
I'm not just gonna sit around
like some old lady.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.961
I want to get something pierced.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.506
Like my, uh, nose
or my tongue or something.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.425
Really? Because, you know, that hurts.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.468
So what? You know, the way I see it...

05:03.636 --> 05:05.804
Ow! Son of a bitch.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.766
Look, Rachel,
I know what you're going through.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.228
I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.567
Get out of my apartment.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.070
Rach, for what it's worth,
I think that you're doing great.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.115
I mean, let's face it,
no one handles this well.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.242
Heh. Least of all you.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.542
Would you put that back on.
Monica's gonna be here any minute.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.919
But it hurts my Joey's apple.

05:40.423 --> 05:45.177
Okay, for the last time,
it's not named after each individual man.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.350
You've done a wonderful job
with this party, Chandler.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.644
- Everything looks so lovely.
- Oh, well, not as lovely as you.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.357
I mean, I can't believe
you would have a 30-year-old daughter.

05:58.566 --> 06:02.402
And you, I can't believe
you would have a tux that's 30 years old.

06:03.279 --> 06:07.783
It's older than that. Ross was actually
conceived right near this tuxedo.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.451
Oh.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.913
Okay, everybody hide.
I saw her. She's coming.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.665
Okay, okay. Everybody down.
Everybody down.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.966
Okay, everybody stay here.
I will find out what's going on.

06:27.011 --> 06:30.305
Hey, you got the door open.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.809
Hey, are you drunk?

06:34.060 --> 06:35.227
No.

06:37.563 --> 06:38.730
Okay.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.607
Whoa.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.361
Okay.

06:45.738 --> 06:49.074
See, I was a little nervous
about turning...

06:49.325 --> 06:50.367
...30.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.704
So the busboys
took me out for some drinks.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.544
Might want to puke on you later.

07:02.088 --> 07:07.008
Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown
a very formal surprise party for you.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.469
All your friends are in there
and your parents.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.847
- No.
- Yes.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.850
Oh, no. My parents have never
seen me drunk.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.560
That they know of.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.731
Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee
and they will never know that you're drunk.

07:21.941 --> 07:24.443
- Really, you promise?
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.695
I love you so much.

07:27.029 --> 07:30.991
Okay, we have to do something
about your breath.

07:31.909 --> 07:34.286
What about your breath?

07:35.371 --> 07:37.372
That's still yours.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.002
Okay, now, remember,
it's a surprise party.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.546
So when you go in, act surprised.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.839
- Okay.
- Okay. Shh.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.132
Ready?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.724
Surprise!

08:01.939 --> 08:03.607
Okay, forward. Forward.

08:03.816 --> 08:04.983
Stop!

08:06.527 --> 08:08.111
Okay, back... Stop!

08:10.072 --> 08:13.241
Okay, for... Stop! Stop! Stop!

08:14.410 --> 08:16.661
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.664
I'm gonna break into this minivan,
put it in neutral.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.709
You guys push it forward
so Ross can drive out of the spot.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.795
Okay? All right. Here we go.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.303
Haul ass!

08:45.274 --> 08:48.109
Happy 30th birthday. Here.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.571
It's for the child in you.
And the woman.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.532
Happy 30th.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.534
Why do you keep saying that?

08:55.868 --> 08:58.203
Because it's our 30th birthday.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.790
Yeah, no, we're not 30.
We're 31. Okay.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.000
Wait.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.629
Oh, it's you.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.548
Yeah. What?

09:09.757 --> 09:11.800
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.301
Nuh-uh.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.971
Yuh-huh. That's what it says
on my birth certificate.

09:16.180 --> 09:17.764
You have your birth certificate?

09:18.015 --> 09:20.892
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff
when my mom died.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.477
Our mom.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.146
Right. Okay.

09:25.982 --> 09:30.068
- Do you have my birth certificate?
- No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.239
Oh, my God.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.284
Oh, my God, we are 31.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.035
Yeah.

09:40.037 --> 09:42.872
I just lost a whole year of my life.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.374
Okay.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.378
- Your middle name is Pamela?
- Yes.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.631
Oh, I never knew mine.
Do you remember what it is?

09:51.882 --> 09:54.009
Yes. Phoebe.

09:55.219 --> 09:59.014
- That's my first name.
- Right. Okay. Then, no.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.645
Look at that. We made it all the way
across the room. You're doing great.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.940
- What's going on?
- Monica's a little drunk.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.443
Yay, I love drunk Monica.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.031
Oh, she's so much more fun
than regular Monica.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.369
She doesn't want her parents
to know she's drunk.

10:21.954 --> 10:24.956
Oh, all right, all right.
Here's what we'll do.

10:25.166 --> 10:29.127
I'll get twice as drunk as Monica
and then no one's even gonna notice her.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.966
What's going on?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.093
Monica's wasted.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.888
Maybe that'll liven up this party.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.974
Okay, will you just go help her
get changed, please?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.645
Okay, but taking care of a drunk,
naked woman seems like a job for Joey.

10:46.854 --> 10:47.896
Yep.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.652
- This one's from me.
- Ah.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.529
It wasn't on your list,
but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.908
A scooter.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.870
Stick to the list.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.583
Always stick to the list.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.711
No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.714
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.425
Now that you're a couple,
we don't get two presents from you?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.762
For my last birthday,
you gave me a hug.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.765
- Okay, read the card, read the card.
- Okay.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.896
"Happy birthday, Grandma.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.901
It's better to be over the hill...

11:35.569 --> 11:37.696
...than buried under it.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.868
All our love,
Monica and Chandler." That's funny.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.454
No, no, no, no. That was a joke.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.457
I know, I get it. It's funny.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.668
No, because you're not a grandmother.

11:51.877 --> 11:55.422
I know, because to be a grandmother,
you have to be married and have children.

11:55.631 --> 12:00.135
I don't have any of those things.
That's why it's so funny.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.137
I'm just gonna go...

12:06.684 --> 12:09.477
All you had to do was buy the card.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.402
Okay, you know what?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.321
It was stupid to get upset
about not having a husband and kids.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.824
All I really needed was a plan.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.034
See, I wanna have three kids.

12:25.327 --> 12:27.787
Let me guess. And you want to have them
all at the same time...

12:27.955 --> 12:30.331
...and you want to have them
for your brother. Ha, ha.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.835
As I was saying...

12:34.336 --> 12:37.630
I should probably have the first
of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.966
Which gives me five years.

12:40.676 --> 12:44.846
So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35,
I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.

12:45.055 --> 12:48.767
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.

12:51.687 --> 12:55.690
Oh, wait, but I do want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.776
Really? That long?

13:02.615 --> 13:05.575
Look all you want, it's happening.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.538
So I don't have to get married
until I'm 33.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.707
That's three years.
That's three whole years.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.083
Oh, wait a minute though.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.462
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.

13:18.214 --> 13:21.132
And I'd like to know the guy
for like a year, year and a half...

13:21.383 --> 13:24.344
...before we get engaged.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.723
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.062
Which is fine,
because you just turned...

13:34.313 --> 13:36.064
...28.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.317
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.

13:39.568 --> 13:43.029
According to my plan, I should already
be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.080
Will you quit hogging it?

13:57.253 --> 14:01.172
Oh, I'm telling you, it's like
watching Bambi learn how to walk.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.884
You're drunk.

14:05.594 --> 14:09.097
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.183
Maybe I'm a little drunk.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.187
Hey. Are those crab cakes?

14:16.438 --> 14:20.149
Did I not tell you to come straight to me
when more crab cakes were ready?

14:22.444 --> 14:23.778
How you feeling?

14:24.780 --> 14:27.448
You are so handsome.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.495
I want to make love to you
right here, right now.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.293
I really wish that you wouldn't.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.298
All you have to do is just get through
a little bit more, okay?

14:43.465 --> 14:49.554
Then we can put you in bed, okay?
Just smile and don't talk to anyone.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.516
Speech, speech.
Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?

14:54.602 --> 14:55.643
Pheebs.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.812
Don't you see,
everybody's looking at me.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.480
The plan's working.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.651
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.112
Speech. Come on, speech.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.615
Come on. Speech.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.994
Hey, Chandler, you can't keep
your hands off her for one second.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.829
Oh, I think it's nice.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.290
I think it's necessary.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.009
I wanna thank you all for coming.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.346
My family and my friends.

15:31.513 --> 15:33.973
Whoo-hoo.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.312
I'd really like to say that I'm, um...

15:40.147 --> 15:43.024
You know what I'd really like to say?

15:43.734 --> 15:45.860
I'm drunk.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.906
That's right, Mom and Dad.

15:50.157 --> 15:53.534
Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.290
And guess what? I've been drunk before.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.168
And I've smoked a cigarette.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.546
But you know what? You know what?

16:05.756 --> 16:11.678
It's all okay.
It's okay, because I turned 30 today.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.222
And I can do anything I want.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.934
Because I am a grownup.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.693
- Okay, quick. Help me get this off.
- Yeah.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.739
I lost a whole year.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.575
I can't believe it. This is so unfair.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.744
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.246
Will it? Will it?

16:39.581 --> 16:42.250
How would you feel if you found out
you were 31?

16:42.418 --> 16:46.254
That's not gonna happen, you know,
because we have a new deal.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.716
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.928
I haven't done any of the things
I wanted to do by the time I was 31.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.888
- Like what?
- Like, okay...

16:56.056 --> 16:58.558
...I haven't met any Portuguese people.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.269
I haven't had the perfect kiss.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.771
And I haven't been to sniper school.

17:05.773 --> 17:08.943
Phoebe, why don't we go upstairs
and have some birthday cake?

17:09.319 --> 17:12.946
No, I just feel like being by myself for a
while, all right? I'll see you guys later.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.490
Thanks.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.367
Oh, poor Pheebs.

17:17.618 --> 17:21.122
Hey, you know what, you guys?
I think I'm gonna go walk her home.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.127
- Oh, man.
- What?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.297
He's gonna eat the cake.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.508
Pheebs. Wait up.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.302
Listen, I...

17:35.179 --> 17:36.304
Close your eyes.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.903
Maybe that's one
you can cross off your list.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.324
Oh, yeah. Heh.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.286
Oh, and plus,
I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.504
Okay, is everybody clear?
We're gonna pick it up...

18:10.923 --> 18:12.340
...and move it.

18:13.550 --> 18:18.679
All we need is teamwork, okay?
We're gonna lift the car...

18:18.847 --> 18:22.016
...and slide it out.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.103
Lift...

18:25.354 --> 18:27.605
...and slide.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.525
- Ross, I really don't think this...
- Lift...

18:31.610 --> 18:33.861
...and slide.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.697
- Okay, here we go.
- All right, everyone.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.574
Lift...

18:42.412 --> 18:44.455
...and slide.

18:48.585 --> 18:52.463
- Hey, Joey...
- Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.925
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.137
Oh, okay.
Hey, can I ride this outside?

18:59.388 --> 19:01.889
- Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother.
- Okay.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.142
- Not in the street!
- Yeah.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.603
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:07.771 --> 19:12.859
- How you doing, you feeling any better?
- Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...

19:13.485 --> 19:16.112
- Let's talk.
- Okay.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.573
- Um...
- What's up?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.159
Uh, Tag, um...

19:21.577 --> 19:25.079
You're such a great guy,
and we have so much fun together.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.497
- But I...
- Wait.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.417
I think I see where you're going.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.379
But before you say anything else,
can I just say one more thing?

19:41.889 --> 19:43.264
Well said.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.895
And a, uh, good example of the fun
I was referring to.

19:49.438 --> 19:55.276
Uh, but, heh, I think I'm past the point
where I can, you know, just have fun.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.988
Rachel, don't do this.
This is just because you're turning 30.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.990
Yeah, it is.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.952
But you're just a kid.
I mean, you're 25.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.788
- Twenty-four, actually.
- Oh, God.

20:10.292 --> 20:15.171
You know what I wish?
I wish you were six years older.

20:15.422 --> 20:19.800
Well, actually, if I'm wishing for stuff,
I actually wish I was six years younger.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.638
- Me too.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.981
Hey, how'd it go?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.399
Oh.

20:35.567 --> 20:40.071
If I only want two kids,
can I keep him for another year?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.324
You did the right thing.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.081
I don't like this anymore.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.172
Well, here we are.
Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.

20:59.341 --> 21:03.678
Wow, do you realize in 10 years
we're gonna be 40?

21:07.015 --> 21:12.019
Why, God?
Why are you doing this to us?

21:19.611 --> 21:22.697
Yes. My baby's finally free.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.198
All right.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.867
Start it up. Let's go.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.246
Whoo-hoo!

21:35.877 --> 21:37.420
How hot are we?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.221
You wanna buy a car?
