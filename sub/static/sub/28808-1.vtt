Who? Charlie?

No. Father.

I know.

32:54.246 --> 32:55.214
How do you know?

32:56.481 --> 32:59.248
Because when your old man
shut down the mill,

32:59.250 --> 33:00.684
that's all Father talked about.

33:00.686 --> 33:02.655
It was money owed to him.

33:04.690 --> 33:06.325
So when your old man died...

43:59.210 --> 44:00.275
What will they
do to him

44:00.277 --> 44:01.446
up at the lodge?

44:06.216 --> 44:10.018
They'll get him ready
for a hand-off...

44:10.020 --> 44:11.122
to a buyer.

44:12.457 --> 44:13.922
[Clair]: And after that?

44:13.924 --> 44:15.091
[Larsen]: Lost to the world...

44:15.093 --> 44:17.092
I imagine.

44:17.094 --> 44:19.330
You were never going to give him
back to me, were you?

44:20.297 --> 44:22.531
What's the matter
with you people?

44:22.533 --> 44:24.035
What if that was your child?

44:32.243 --> 44:33.911
I was that child.

45:04.975 --> 45:06.044
[wolves howling]

45:09.013 --> 45:10.949
What is it?

45:15.386 --> 45:17.189
It weren't nothing.

45:20.591 --> 45:22.493
You look a little scared.

45:25.096 --> 45:28.563
You saw what they did
to Phillip.

45:28.565 --> 45:30.268
And I know you're out of ammo.

45:32.502 --> 45:35.140
Truth be told, it's not
the wolves I'm worried about.

45:40.410 --> 45:41.412
I'm making a fire.

45:50.154 --> 45:52.455
[Clair]: There's something
I don't understand.

45:52.457 --> 45:54.526
Why didn't you
just let me drown?

45:58.263 --> 45:59.031
I don't know.

46:01.632 --> 46:03.401
I guess
there's better ways to die.

46:09.306 --> 46:11.209
You don't have to die
on this mountain.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.113
You think about that.

46:25.556 --> 46:27.192
You said you were that child.

46:29.426 --> 46:31.028
So?

46:36.701 --> 46:39.669
When I was about your son's age,

46:39.671 --> 46:42.174
my parents owed Father money.

46:44.575 --> 46:47.044
When they couldn't pay,
he came to collect.

46:49.647 --> 46:53.516
He killed my daddy.

46:53.518 --> 46:56.384
He took my mom and me
as payment,

46:56.386 --> 46:59.156
and he kept her for himself.

47:04.194 --> 47:06.097
She had the chance to escape.
She ran.

47:08.332 --> 47:09.464
For the longest time,

47:09.466 --> 47:13.703
I waited for her
to come back to get me.

47:13.705 --> 47:15.239
She never did.

47:19.176 --> 47:20.344
Why didn't you run?

47:24.214 --> 47:25.283
And go where?

47:33.223 --> 47:35.227
I think we have a lot more
in common than you think.

47:37.661 --> 47:38.663
From what the letter said...

47:40.732 --> 47:42.601
...he didn't take Charlie
for the money.

47:45.703 --> 47:49.107
He's looking at getting revenge
on a man who's already dead.

I sure hope so.

You're a proud one,
ain't you, little boy?

53:36.853 --> 53:40.355
You're just like your
grandfather used to be.

53:40.357 --> 53:42.424
You knew my grandpa?

53:42.426 --> 53:43.458
Oh, yeah.

53:43.460 --> 53:44.625
I knew your
grandfather.

53:44.627 --> 53:46.730
He was a righteous man.

53:48.399 --> 53:50.632
But a long time ago,

53:50.634 --> 53:55.737
the Lord turned his face away
from your grandfather,

53:55.739 --> 53:58.410
and he came to me on his knees.

54:00.678 --> 54:02.478
What did you do?

54:02.480 --> 54:05.948
I did what any
decent man would do.

54:05.950 --> 54:08.886
To a man who was drowning,
I gave him my hand.

54:11.422 --> 54:12.754
What happened?

54:12.756 --> 54:14.922
He took it...

54:14.924 --> 54:18.462
and then he tried
to pull me down with him.

54:19.964 --> 54:21.730
He kicked me.

54:21.732 --> 54:25.734
He stood on my back,

54:25.736 --> 54:28.672
and he tried to get me down
all the way to the bottom.

54:30.640 --> 54:32.476
He was a righteous man.

54:35.446 --> 54:37.549
He was a self-righteous man.

54:38.915 --> 54:40.951
There's no forgiveness
in that man.

54:42.453 --> 54:46.558
He did to me
what your mother's doing to you.

54:51.562 --> 54:52.797
You don't get it, do you?

54:54.931 --> 54:58.466
If she paid the ransom...

54:58.468 --> 54:59.803
they'd be here by now.

55:18.955 --> 55:20.656
Huh? Where are the boys?

no one's coming back.

Now, one way or the other,

55:42.513 --> 55:45.781
those boys,
they haven't come back.

55:45.783 --> 55:48.083
So if they're not dead...

55:48.085 --> 55:49.954
they'd better
goddamn wish they were!

We're not waiting on them?

on them.

Your fate is always
in somebody else's hands!

56:37.902 --> 56:39.838
And it's your family's fate
to suffer!

56:41.538 --> 56:43.605
Your grandfather
didn't know that!

56:43.607 --> 56:44.672
He didn't believe it,

56:44.674 --> 56:47.911
so he took fate in his own hands
and he crossed me!

56:49.113 --> 56:52.917
Now fate's just
biding her time...

56:56.654 --> 56:59.788

Somewhere in the desert.

57:39.062 --> 57:40.895
We met in Afghanistan.

57:40.897 --> 57:43.033
I got pregnant, so we came home.

57:46.203 --> 57:49.870
Right after Charlie was born,

57:49.872 --> 57:53.641
an IED took out
his father's Humvee.

57:53.643 --> 57:54.879
There was nothing left.

57:56.814 --> 58:00.214

I re-deployed.

58:00.216 --> 58:01.885

I needed to be there.

back to me,

01:00:35.205 --> 01:00:38.140

you're going to deal with me

I'll kill more
if you force me to.

You know,
I can't remember a time

01:14:53.662 --> 01:14:57.765
when I wasn't driven by rage,

01:14:57.767 --> 01:15:02.104
and my father saw it in me
when I was a little boy.

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:06.173
He tried to beat it out of me.

01:15:06.175 --> 01:15:09.075

how it all
came to a head for him

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.182
when I came of age.

01:15:21.724 --> 01:15:25.662
You know, I kept Hobbs first
out of curiosity.

01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:31.932
I thought I saw in her
a little bit of me,

01:15:31.934 --> 01:15:34.935

01:15:34.937 --> 01:15:37.974
If I didn't kill her father,
she would have.

01:15:39.776 --> 01:15:42.075

01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:44.046
for weeding, housekeeping.

01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:50.086
You were the first one
I ever met I felt no rage for.

01:15:53.156 --> 01:15:55.158
You were the son I never had.

01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:03.700

I couldn't trust you.

She...
she tried to betray me,

01:16:36.299 --> 01:16:38.268
and she certainly
betrayed you...

01:16:39.402 --> 01:16:42.770

and left you here alone.

01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:44.204
