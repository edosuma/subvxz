WEBVTT

00:07.264 --> 00:09.357
...stumble on these thieves,
you could get hurt.

00:09.427 --> 00:12.487
This Torah,
this piece of parchment,

00:12.563 --> 00:14.724
is something that I would
risk anything for.

00:15.967 --> 00:19.198
I don't wanna hear anymore
about stolen Torahs.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.932
Do you have a plan?
Of course,
we have a plan.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.176
It appears that things
are starting to go our way.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.989
T. C: Maybe a little
more hot sauce.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.085
More hot sauce.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.151
Mmm-hmm.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.596
Don't you think you
ought to taste it first?
Mmm-mmm.

03:18.666 --> 03:23.160
A truly great chef
can identify the missing
ingredients merely by smell.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.003
Can I?

03:42.156 --> 03:43.384
Magnum,

03:43.991 --> 03:48.360
I need you to drive
to the airport and meet
Flight 42 from Taipei.

03:48.429 --> 03:52.092
It arrives at 2:05, and
if you leave immediately,
you'll be on time.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.860
A very dear friend of mine,
Asher Solomon, is arriving.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.165
Naturally, I had planned
to pick him up myself.

03:57.238 --> 04:01.140
But unfortunately, I received
an urgent telephone call from
Mr. Masters regarding some

04:01.208 --> 04:03.676
business I need to take care
of for him on the North Shore.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.837
I don't have time
to go over the details.
Suffice it to say

04:05.913 --> 04:08.780
that I wouldn't ask this
of you unless it were
absolutely necessary.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.214
Maybe a dash more hot sauce.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.878
I hope I can
count on you to help me out
in this emergency.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.284
No!

04:14.755 --> 04:17.986
Magnum, I have no time
for your childish obstinance.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.620
My God, what is that odor?

04:22.730 --> 04:26.131
Higgie baby,
you are talking about my
Uncle Roland's original

04:26.200 --> 04:28.794
Creole Flaming
Bayou Blaster chili.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.336
Wanna try a little taste?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.937
Not without a paramedic
in attendance.

04:34.175 --> 04:36.109
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.775
Oh, hey, I gotta go.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.645
Thomas.

04:41.916 --> 04:44.180
Look, I'll be back
after my charter.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.717
You've got to stir that chili
constantly for two hours.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.517
Two hours?
Yes.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.022
And then prepare yourself
for a culinary event.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.922
Oh.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.488
Whatever you do,
don't quit stirring,

04:58.566 --> 05:00.761
or else you'll end up
with Creole cement.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.426
Later, Higgie baby.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.702
Cement.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.040
And chili.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.481
Genuine Creole bayou.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.388
Magnum, I very seldom
ask a favor of you,

05:23.457 --> 05:25.254
but this is
very important to me.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.521
In all honesty, there is
no one else I would trust

05:27.595 --> 05:31.031
to pick up my old,
dear friend, Asher Solomon.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.727
Will you go?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.630
Will you stir?
I can't.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.673
<i>Flight 42 from Taipei</i>
<i>now arriving at Gate 27.</i>

05:52.553 --> 05:55.181
<i>I was all the way</i>
<i>to the airport</i>
<i>before I realized</i>

05:55.256 --> 05:58.453
<i>Higgins had left</i>
<i>without telling me what</i>
<i>Asher Solomon looked like.</i>

05:58.926 --> 06:01.087
<i>I figured</i>
<i>I'd have to improvise.</i>

06:03.731 --> 06:06.495
<i>Mr. Yamashiro to a
<i>white courtesy phone.</i></i>

06:06.567 --> 06:08.865
<i>Mr. Yamashiro to a
<i>white courtesy phone.</i></i>

06:08.936 --> 06:10.233
Aloha.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.036
Hello.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.840
I am Rabbi Asher Solomon.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.117
Welcome to Hawaii.

06:29.456 --> 06:32.516
<i>At first,</i>
<i>I was really annoyed with</i>
<i>Higgins for not telling me</i>

06:32.593 --> 06:33.992
<i>Asher Solomon was a Rabbi.</i>

06:34.561 --> 06:36.722
<i>But as we drove along,</i>
<i>I realized</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:41.160
<i>I couldn't stay annoyed</i>
<i>at Higgins or anybody else</i>
<i>with Rabbi Solomon around.</i>

06:41.702 --> 06:43.727
<i>It wasn't exactly</i>
<i>the stories he told,</i>

06:44.371 --> 06:47.306
<i>though, as he talked, I almost</i>
<i>felt I'd been there with him</i>

06:47.374 --> 06:50.810
<i>as he fled from Poland</i>
<i>to Shanghai, fought with</i>
<i>the Haganah in Israel,</i>

06:51.178 --> 06:53.874
<i>coached the Maccabiah</i>
<i>soccer team in New York.</i>

06:53.981 --> 06:55.346
<i>But more than that,</i>

06:55.949 --> 06:58.611
<i>he just had a knack for</i>
<i>making you like him.</i>

06:58.986 --> 07:01.750
I've been thinking, Thomas,
of the Polynesians.

07:02.156 --> 07:04.886
Journeying over vast
stretches of this

07:04.958 --> 07:07.756
beautiful and often
treacherous Pacific Ocean

07:07.828 --> 07:10.558
in open boats
no bigger than this car,

07:10.798 --> 07:13.733
seeking paradise
as foretold by their god.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.735
Not unlike the early Hebrews.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.895
Traveling in the desert,
wandering there,

07:17.971 --> 07:21.304
looking for the Promised Land,
for the land of Canaan.

07:21.709 --> 07:25.839
Or even the European Jews
seeking refuge in Shanghai
in 1945?

07:25.913 --> 07:29.644
Ah, yes, Shanghai.
Nice, beautiful people.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.518
It was a refuge of peace,
until the Japanese set up

07:33.587 --> 07:36.715
the munitions dumps and
the Allies came and bombed.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.590
The temple was destroyed.
It was laid in waste
completely.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.522
And this poor Torah
was buried under the rubble.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.055
Oh, but that's all the past.
It's history.

07:47.501 --> 07:51.528
Now, to be here, in Hawaii,
for a reunion

07:51.605 --> 07:54.665
with the many families
who came from Shanghai.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.736
And this poor Torah
that we gave up for lost,

07:58.045 --> 08:02.106
returned to us by
the Taiwanese Department
of Antiquities.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.220
Perhaps he needs assistance.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.290
Maybe.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.440
Hold it. Don't move.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.803
Hey! What's going on here?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.580
Come on! Let's go!

08:58.739 --> 09:00.001
You all right?

09:02.709 --> 09:03.903
The Torah.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.147
That filthy pig
took my Torah.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.351
I was shocked to hear of this
senseless, violent act,

09:16.423 --> 09:19.324
and I take personal
responsibility
for your tragic loss.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.418
Please, Miss Chou,
it was nobody's fault.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.194
No, no.
If I had met you
at the airport

09:25.265 --> 09:27.392
perhaps none of this
would have happened.

09:27.468 --> 09:29.800
I regret that other
obligations kept me away.

09:29.870 --> 09:33.431
If it weren't for you
and your friends in
the Department of Antiquities,

09:33.674 --> 09:37.075
the Torah would never have
been found or turned over
to me in the first place.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.671
But...
I cannot believe that God
has brought us this far

09:40.747 --> 09:42.942
only to have
the Torah lost again.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.184
So, I thank you for
your concern

09:45.252 --> 09:47.379
and I thank you
for your generosity

09:47.454 --> 09:49.786
in bringing the car
for me to use.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.815
It is the least
we could do.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.656
Well, I'm afraid
I must be on my way.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.598
Good night, Rabbi.
Good night.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.266
I do hope you feel better.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.632
Nice meeting you.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.065
Good night, Mr. Higgins.
Good night.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.973
Good night. Drive carefully.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.209
Honestly, Magnum.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.474
How could you allow something
like this to happen?

10:17.551 --> 10:21.043
Me? I was the one doing
the favor, remember?

10:21.121 --> 10:24.420
If you hadn't been chasing
around the North Shore trying
to track down some

10:24.491 --> 10:27.153
art forger-mercenary-soldier
Frank What's-his-name?

10:27.227 --> 10:29.752
Franz Wallen,
and I was hardly chasing.

10:29.830 --> 10:34.062
I was sent by Mr. Masters
to find the man and secure
the rights to his life story

10:34.134 --> 10:36.193
before he sold them
to someone else.
Gentlemen...

10:36.270 --> 10:38.898
The proceeds from the sale
of a best seller
based upon his life

10:38.972 --> 10:40.462
would have insured
construction of a

10:40.541 --> 10:42.668
desperately needed new wing
at the Children's Hospital.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.574
Fine, that's just
fine, Higgins,

10:44.645 --> 10:46.203
but the least you could've
done is warn me

10:46.280 --> 10:48.305
I'd be walking into
a potentially dangerous
situation.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.373
Gentlemen...
I would think that,
in your line of work,

10:50.450 --> 10:52.441
you would keep an eye out
for that sort of thing.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.249
Gentlemen, please,
you're giving me a headache.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.223
Now, Thomas, there is no way
you could have known

10:58.292 --> 11:01.261
that somebody organizing
a very clever plan
to steal the Torah.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.728
And Jonathan, even if
you had been there,

11:03.797 --> 11:06.925
there was nothing
you could have done
that Thomas did not do.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.268
Perhaps you're right.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.200
What do the police
have to say?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.102
They said
they'd do their best.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.371
Well, why should a piece
of parchment and some ink
be of any importance to them?

11:19.446 --> 11:20.777
No importance at all.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.442
But now, I have a car.
I will track down the Torah.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.883
Magnum and I
will go with you.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.148
No, no, you still have
this Franz Wallen to find,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.951
and the children need
their hospital. You must not
worry about me.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.514
But you know
nothing of Honolulu,

11:32.593 --> 11:34.686
or of tracking down
criminals, for that matter.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.319
Mmm, I could learn.

11:36.897 --> 11:41.061
With all due respect,
if I am not for myself,
who will be?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.999
Look, I'm afraid
it's just not that easy.

11:46.073 --> 11:49.565
Even if you happen to
stumble on these thieves,
you could get hurt.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.940
Hurt? Pish-posh.

11:54.014 --> 11:58.951
You must realize
that this Torah,
this piece of parchment,

11:59.786 --> 12:02.186
is something that I would
risk anything for.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.182
It is a tangible reminder

12:06.259 --> 12:09.160
of where we come from
and what we have
lived through.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.922
Look,

12:11.398 --> 12:14.595
my wife and son
were killed in Poland
before we could escape,

12:14.801 --> 12:17.736
the temple in Shanghai
has been long in ruins,

12:17.871 --> 12:21.568
but this Torah
has been reborn.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.940
It has been resurrected.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.371
You think I will let it
get lost again?

12:27.814 --> 12:28.974
No, sir.

12:31.818 --> 12:32.910
Well,

12:34.421 --> 12:37.618
if you wouldn't mind
a slightly battered

12:37.691 --> 12:40.353
old private investigator
tagging along,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.361
I would consider it
an honor to help you
in your search.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.767
That would be fine.

12:52.606 --> 12:56.406
Yeah, okay. All right.
I expect I owe you one.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.874
What's he mumbling about?

12:59.946 --> 13:02.176
He's not mumbling,
he's saying his daily prayers.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.150
Oh, come on.
You don't expect me to fall
for that rabbi bit, do you?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.583
I mean, what are you
doing with a Rab...

13:06.653 --> 13:09.281
He is a rabbi. He's got a cap
on the back of his head.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.880
It's not a cap, Rick, it's...

13:11.258 --> 13:13.351
Will you just give me
the address, please?

13:13.427 --> 13:14.951
If I would've known
he was a rabbi, I mean,

13:15.028 --> 13:18.054
I would've had a Bible here,
or at least I would've
straightened the office up

13:18.131 --> 13:20.463
and made it look
more appropriate.
Rick, the address.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.060
Okay.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.672
You know, do me a favor.
Next time, when you give me
the details,

13:27.741 --> 13:31.438
at least give me a little bit
more than, "The big van
was painted the same color

13:31.511 --> 13:34.844
"as the boys' locker room
in junior high," will you?
Here.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.844
You don't have to whisper.
He knows about the case.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.113
Oi, do I know it.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.447
But, Thomas, there's one thing
I don't understand.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.054
How do you know that
the van was rented?

13:46.126 --> 13:49.391
Because most of those
rental trucks have those
mileage counters

13:49.463 --> 13:51.055
on the rear wheels
to prevent cheating.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.224
Oh. I've learnt something.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.135
But, you know,
I'm sure that those
rental agency people

13:56.203 --> 13:59.263
will be very much
impressed by
your observation.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.372
I don't know what you're
talking about, pal,

14:04.845 --> 14:06.073
and I don't care.

14:06.713 --> 14:08.544
We only got two trucks
like you're describing,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.276
and I would've known
either one of them went out,

14:10.350 --> 14:11.544
'cause I would've
dispatched them.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.449
There is a saying
I've heard, sir.

14:13.520 --> 14:18.014
"Sometimes a child has
a mind of his own, even if
forbidden by the parent."

14:18.892 --> 14:20.416
What's he talking about?

14:20.560 --> 14:23.825
<i>Mechanic to the</i>
<i>loading dock. The mechanic</i>
<i>to the front loading dock.</i>

14:23.897 --> 14:28.163
Look, all we wanna do is
talk to anybody who worked
the yard yesterday.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.829
Maybe look at those two
trucks that you mentioned,

14:30.904 --> 14:33.805
and see if one of them
has a little red paint
on it, that's all.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.365
Sure. Why not?

14:36.443 --> 14:38.570
It's no skin
off of my nose.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.345
Hey, Vic!
Get your butt in here.

14:42.716 --> 14:45.776
These guys want to know
about a van and a pickup.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.834
Hold it!

15:07.674 --> 15:09.699
Freeze! Police!

15:22.856 --> 15:25.222
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:28.762 --> 15:29.922
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

15:35.918 --> 15:37.647
A stolen Torah?

15:41.457 --> 15:43.322
Come on, Magnum,
you can do better than that.

15:43.392 --> 15:46.293
Well, strange as it sounds,
he's telling you the truth.

15:46.762 --> 15:49.060
Two guys in a van
ambush you,

15:49.131 --> 15:52.726
steal a Torah, and stash it
at a truck-rental agency?

15:52.801 --> 15:54.359
It's a van and a pickup.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.170
Magnum, I'm in no mood
to play games.

15:57.306 --> 15:59.774
I got four officers out
with this damn flu.

15:59.942 --> 16:03.844
And I personally feel
like I've been dragged over
the Hana Road after a flood.

16:04.146 --> 16:07.138
Don't aggravate me.
Just answer my questions.

16:07.850 --> 16:10.876
What were you doing
at Rent-a-Junker?

16:11.186 --> 16:14.121
We just wanted to talk
to this kid, Vic Makula,

16:14.189 --> 16:15.622
about the stolen Torah.
- Lieutenant.

16:15.691 --> 16:19.024
I don't wanna hear anymore
about stolen Torahs.

16:23.032 --> 16:27.162
All right, it looks like
you actually did file
a report on the stolen Torah.

16:27.236 --> 16:31.036
Forgive me,
Lieutenant, but may I ask,
what were you doing there?

16:31.840 --> 16:35.332
I'm afraid that's official
police business, Rabbi.

16:35.411 --> 16:39.313
Well, I certainly would not
want to interfere with
official police business.

16:39.381 --> 16:42.111
I only asked because
Thomas here thought

16:42.184 --> 16:45.017
that you might
be able to give us
some information.

16:50.926 --> 16:54.760
I just thought you might
be able to give us
something on Vic Makula.

16:55.330 --> 16:59.096
If I had anything on him,
what makes you think
I could give it to you?

17:00.469 --> 17:03.131
Oh, Lieutenant,
you're not a well man.

17:03.205 --> 17:04.866
If I may make a suggestion...

17:04.940 --> 17:07.500
I know. Chicken soup, right?

17:07.576 --> 17:11.773
No, actually, chicken soup
has never worked
very well for me.

17:11.847 --> 17:15.010
And from what I read of
the canned variety,
with the chemicals and all,

17:15.084 --> 17:16.608
it's worse than
the cold itself.

17:16.685 --> 17:19.654
No, I have always liked

17:19.954 --> 17:22.685
some hot peppermint schnapps,

17:22.758 --> 17:26.694
together with the juice
of two limes and a teaspoonful
of baking soda.

17:26.762 --> 17:29.458
It works every time. Here,
I'll write it down for you.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.690
You say it works every time?

17:32.768 --> 17:34.463
Well, most times.

17:34.536 --> 17:37.903
But if you take enough,
you don't care so much
that you are sick.

17:39.942 --> 17:42.001
That's very nice of you.

17:43.245 --> 17:47.079
If there's nothing else,
then we won't trouble you
any further.

17:52.888 --> 17:54.515
Rabbi, wait a minute.

17:56.058 --> 18:00.017
A few weeks ago, we got wind
that a major international
smuggling ring

18:00.095 --> 18:02.893
had added a Honolulu leg
to its circuit.

18:02.998 --> 18:07.094
But then, after hundreds
of man-hours of work,
not much else surfaced.

18:08.437 --> 18:09.802
Until?

18:09.872 --> 18:11.203
Until yesterday.

18:11.273 --> 18:16.108
Interpol cabled us information
that led us to this
car-and-truck-rental agency,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.669
and to Vic Makula
in particular.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.142
So, the smugglers were
using the rental agency
for transportation?

18:22.217 --> 18:23.980
That's what we figured.

18:24.052 --> 18:26.850
But we'd only had the place
staked out for two hours,

18:27.222 --> 18:30.157
and the two of you showed up
and blew the whole thing.

18:30.225 --> 18:32.386
Now, Makula's tipped off.

18:34.096 --> 18:35.256
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

18:35.330 --> 18:38.822
Thank you. Rabbi,
I'm only telling you
all of this

18:38.901 --> 18:41.631
so you'll understand
these smugglers are dangerous.

18:41.803 --> 18:43.737
That's why homicide
is on the case.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.733
We know of at least
two murders here
in Honolulu alone.

18:48.177 --> 18:50.839
So, be careful
where you step, huh?

18:51.413 --> 18:55.509
Thank you, Lieutenant,
for your concern, and aloha.

18:56.151 --> 18:58.346
<i>Shalom, Rabbi. Shalom.</i>

19:00.455 --> 19:03.686
I'll put some pressure
on the boys downstairs
about your Torah.

19:04.393 --> 19:08.796
Magnum, here's all the stuff
the police garage crew
took out of the Ferrari.

19:10.032 --> 19:11.329
Thanks.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.660
I heard there's
a lot of body damage.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.034
Higgins should be
real pleased about that.

19:34.656 --> 19:36.123
Here's your glasses, Rabbi.

19:36.191 --> 19:37.852
Those are not mine.

19:44.633 --> 19:48.501
How would you like
to take a little trip down to
Honolulu's merchant district?

19:51.373 --> 19:54.740
That was terrible, what
somebody did to your shop.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.835
This is great.
Is this you, Doctor?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.105
One of my last fights,
over 20 years ago.

20:00.182 --> 20:02.878
I keep that there
to remind me of why
I became an optician.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.385
I take it you are the one
receiving the punch.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.887
You take it right, uncle.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.118
Now, what is this
information I'm supposed
to be interested in?

20:10.359 --> 20:12.452
I was wondering
if you ever seen
those before?

20:12.527 --> 20:15.087
Of course. I made them.
That's what
I used to do here.

20:15.163 --> 20:17.631
We were hoping
you could tell us for whom.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.997
Well, if I had my files,
it'd be no problem.

20:20.068 --> 20:22.434
I could look up the
frame registration number.

20:22.504 --> 20:24.563
Can you imagine?
They come in here,
they do this,

20:24.640 --> 20:26.301
and all they take
are my files.

20:26.375 --> 20:27.706
Who'd want files?

20:29.244 --> 20:32.509
You think these
belong to the guy that
broke into my store?

20:32.848 --> 20:34.213
Yes, it's possible.

20:34.283 --> 20:35.716
If I ever get
my hands on him,

20:35.784 --> 20:38.082
he'll need more than glasses,
I can promise you that.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.054
Just look at them.
I mean, this lens here

20:41.123 --> 20:44.718
is ground real thick
and the other one's perfectly
clear. Isn't that unusual?

20:44.793 --> 20:48.320
Not in this shop.
I do a lot of work for
the Cauliflower Club.

20:48.397 --> 20:50.388
You know, old boxers
down on their luck.

20:50.465 --> 20:52.558
I give them a big
price break on glasses.

20:52.634 --> 20:55.125
Over the years, I've ground
a lot of lenses like these,

20:55.203 --> 20:57.899
for guys blinded in one eye
from punches or whatever.

20:57.973 --> 21:00.100
And you don't keep
a duplicate set of files?

21:00.175 --> 21:03.008
No, not really.
Wait a minute.

21:03.078 --> 21:05.012
Unless he paid cash.

21:05.414 --> 21:07.780
Hey, if I made these for
who I'm thinking of.

21:12.454 --> 21:15.355
Ah, here it is.
I remember him now.

21:15.424 --> 21:17.517
A skinhead,
mean left jab.

21:17.592 --> 21:19.856
Got blinded
in his right eye
in his last fight.

21:20.796 --> 21:23.959
T. C: Yeah, in his prime,
that Dick Ling packed
quite a wallop.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.695
Sort of like my Uncle Roland's
Bayou Blaster chili.

21:27.769 --> 21:30.602
Oh, what a wonderful aroma.

21:30.672 --> 21:33.106
Maui onions,
if I don't miss my guess.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.476
Yeah, that's right.

21:36.778 --> 21:40.077
Oh, you got to chop up
about six big ones real fine.

21:40.349 --> 21:43.785
And then, stir them
thoroughly into the chili.

21:43.852 --> 21:45.012
Naturally.

21:45.087 --> 21:49.820
Guys, do you think
you could swap recipes after
we find Dick Ling? Hmm?

21:49.891 --> 21:53.486
Well, like I said,
Dick Ling was real good.

21:54.329 --> 21:56.160
Probably could've
been world class.

21:56.531 --> 21:59.193
He was Island
Featherweight Champ,
as it was.

21:59.935 --> 22:02.870
But then he ran into
this 18-year-old kid,

22:02.938 --> 22:04.235
a real buzzsaw.

22:04.306 --> 22:06.866
Man, this kid cut
Dick Ling up so bad,

22:06.942 --> 22:09.433
the doctors were lucky
to save even one eye.

22:09.945 --> 22:13.278
You know, you got to
keep the cooking temperature
constant.

22:13.715 --> 22:16.445
That is why stirring
is so important.

22:16.518 --> 22:19.749
T.C., if I had kept
stirring yesterday,

22:19.821 --> 22:23.018
no one would have been
able to pick up Rabbi Solomon
at the airport.

22:23.091 --> 22:27.152
Then Uncle Roland's chili
would've been wasted on
a culinary rookie like me.

22:27.229 --> 22:29.390
Instead, you have
a real gourmet here.

22:29.464 --> 22:31.523
Please, Thomas, I'm
anything but a gourmet.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.090
Come on, don't be
so modest, Rabbi.

22:33.168 --> 22:35.102
How many people could
recognize Maui onions?

22:35.170 --> 22:37.900
So, don't you think
it worked out
for the best, T. C?

22:41.209 --> 22:42.574
Well, I sure do.

22:43.645 --> 22:45.374
So, what about Dick Ling?

22:48.750 --> 22:50.980
I talked to this sports writer
buddy of mine.

22:51.052 --> 22:54.453
He said that Ling was working
at a meat-packing plant
downtown.

22:55.223 --> 22:59.182
Some guy named Shelby
gives ex-cons a break,
hires them there.

22:59.694 --> 23:01.355
That is most commendable.

23:01.430 --> 23:04.729
Yeah. Cheaper, too.
The state subsidizes them.

23:07.669 --> 23:09.159
Oh, Rabbi.

23:09.237 --> 23:11.205
Come here. Look.

23:11.273 --> 23:14.902
Ah, what a wonderful aroma.

23:17.712 --> 23:20.738
So, our Mr. Ling
is an ex-convict?

23:21.850 --> 23:23.374
Yeah, armed robbery.

23:24.386 --> 23:26.911
Mmm, mmm.

23:27.088 --> 23:29.955
It's almost done.
You are going to
love this chili, Rabbi.

23:30.025 --> 23:33.984
Oh, I'm certain I would
if I were only permitted
to eat it.

23:34.062 --> 23:36.428
What do you mean,
if you were permitted to...

23:39.134 --> 23:40.931
Oh, it's not kosher.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.438
But please, T.C.,
you and Thomas eat, enjoy.

23:44.506 --> 23:46.371
The chili smells delicious.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.998
Don't mind me.

23:48.076 --> 23:51.068
No, Ling's shift is
probably up by now.

23:51.146 --> 23:54.445
If we're gonna go,
we better go now.
I'll see you later, T.C.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.878
Keep stirring.

23:56.952 --> 23:58.977
It's that late already?
Oh, wait, wait a minute,
Thomas.

23:59.054 --> 24:00.851
Hey, I got little league
practice in 20 minutes.

24:00.922 --> 24:02.549
You can't... I need you

24:02.624 --> 24:04.615
to stir.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.308
Are you Dick Ling?

24:24.346 --> 24:25.540
How'd you find me?

24:25.614 --> 24:27.809
Hey, now, just...
Wait a minute.
We just want...

24:27.883 --> 24:29.009
Over there!

24:29.084 --> 24:30.711
Take it easy.
Come on, move it.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.381
No funny stuff, now.

24:43.632 --> 24:44.929
Get in.

25:04.585 --> 25:07.247
Ah, he must have
jammed the handle.

25:07.321 --> 25:11.223
There's got to be
a floor pedal or
an emergency release

25:11.291 --> 25:12.758
or something, somewhere.

25:15.729 --> 25:17.094
We have a saying.

25:17.431 --> 25:20.491
"If you're in the dark,
you can't see
what's in the light.

25:20.567 --> 25:23.832
"But if you're in the light,
you can't see
what's in the..."

25:23.904 --> 25:26.498
Actually, I'm not certain that
this saying applies here.

25:26.573 --> 25:28.632
I like it anyway.
Here, Thomas, have a coat.

25:28.709 --> 25:30.199
I think you
must be freezing.

25:30.277 --> 25:32.370
No, no. We're not gonna
be here that long.

25:32.446 --> 25:35.142
You know,
this is the first time
I've been properly dressed

25:35.215 --> 25:37.342
since I arrived in Hawaii.

25:41.622 --> 25:43.453
That's quite an idea.

25:43.824 --> 25:45.086
There we go.

25:46.426 --> 25:47.586
Here we are.

25:50.764 --> 25:51.856
All right.

25:52.332 --> 25:53.424
Now...

25:53.934 --> 25:56.402
One, two, three.

26:05.879 --> 26:07.278
It's unlatched,
but it won't open.

26:07.347 --> 26:09.008
He must've blocked
the door with something.

26:09.082 --> 26:11.277
Thomas, there's
a bright side here.

26:11.351 --> 26:13.717
If Mr. Ling has blocked
the door shut,

26:13.854 --> 26:16.220
then it has to mean that
he's not standing out there

26:16.290 --> 26:17.985
with a gun waiting for us.

26:18.058 --> 26:21.152
That's a very good
deduction, Rabbi.
Let's try this again.

26:21.628 --> 26:24.597
Yes, but this time you have
to put your heart into it.

26:24.665 --> 26:26.826
You have to have faith.
Wait a minute.

26:29.036 --> 26:30.367
Amen!

26:42.449 --> 26:43.609
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

26:43.684 --> 26:46.152
All right, Magnum,
you're off the hook again.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.814
Ballistics says the.38
they found you with

26:48.889 --> 26:50.857
was not the gun
that killed Ling.

26:50.924 --> 26:53.188
Wait a minute,
what do you mean
I'm off the hook?

26:53.260 --> 26:54.522
Didn't you guys
shoot Ling?

26:54.595 --> 26:55.994
Don't be ridiculous.

26:56.063 --> 26:59.430
They just answered an
anonymous shots-fired
call in,

26:59.499 --> 27:02.730
and found you and the Rabbi
there with Ling's body.

27:03.303 --> 27:07.399
They're checking both
bullets against the one
that killed Vic Makula.

27:09.309 --> 27:10.776
Makula's dead, too?

27:11.578 --> 27:14.308
Fished his body out of
the Ala Wai this morning.

27:14.414 --> 27:16.712
What a horrible
waste of youth.

27:17.084 --> 27:20.986
Believe me, Lieutenant,
Thomas and I are just
as puzzled as you.

27:22.122 --> 27:24.522
I guess we're back
to square one.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.922
Well, yeah. I mean,

27:25.993 --> 27:28.518
unless we could
find out who the

27:28.929 --> 27:31.261
gun that killed Ling
was registered to.

27:31.331 --> 27:33.492
I mean, that would be
a place for us to start.

27:33.567 --> 27:34.727
Now, wait a minute.

27:34.801 --> 27:35.893
It didn't belong
to Dick Ling?

27:35.969 --> 27:38.028
No. Ex-cons
can't own firearms.

27:38.238 --> 27:41.105
You know I can't give
you that information.

27:41.174 --> 27:44.166
We couldn't ask the Lieutenant
to give us that, no.

27:44.244 --> 27:45.768
I'm sure it would be
against regulations.

27:45.846 --> 27:47.143
That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:47.214 --> 27:50.650
But regulations could
be bent. I mean, as long as
nobody got hurt.

27:50.717 --> 27:53.811
If it would lead us a step
closer to finding the Torah.

27:53.887 --> 27:55.548
Maybe even Ling's killer.

27:55.622 --> 27:56.884
That's police business.

27:56.957 --> 27:58.754
- No, we can't ask.
- No.

27:58.825 --> 28:00.053
Good.

28:00.127 --> 28:03.824
I will just have to
accept the fact that
the sacred Torah,

28:03.897 --> 28:07.731
symbol of faith and courage
of countless generations
of my people,

28:07.801 --> 28:12.602
has been irrevocably lost,
under the nose of Hawaii's
finest detective.

28:21.014 --> 28:22.481
Excuse me.

28:24.117 --> 28:26.984
I left something
in the copy room.
I'll be right back.

28:32.659 --> 28:34.126
I'll be right back.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.909
Well, Thomas,
what's our next move?

29:01.822 --> 29:03.722
A surprise visit to Shelby.

29:04.624 --> 29:07.218
But, if as
Lieutenant Tanaka says,

29:07.294 --> 29:10.354
he has already been cleared
of the Ling murder.

29:10.797 --> 29:14.494
Yeah, well, Ling was carrying
a gun registered to Shelby,

29:14.568 --> 29:16.160
Ling works
at Shelby's factory,

29:16.236 --> 29:18.761
and Ling was one of the guys
who attacked us
and took the Torah.

29:18.839 --> 29:21.501
I would think
that Shelby might know
something about that.

29:21.575 --> 29:22.837
Yes.

29:23.076 --> 29:27.843
So, it appears that things
are starting to go our way.

29:52.239 --> 29:56.972
Oh, don't worry, Thomas.
I'll have it fixed in no time.

29:57.844 --> 30:01.678
If you can find me a jack.

30:03.050 --> 30:04.677
Oh, that's okay, Rabbi.

30:06.620 --> 30:08.281
You just get the next one.

30:09.222 --> 30:11.452
Oh, all right.

30:12.292 --> 30:15.659
Maybe a story could make
the task seem faster.

30:15.729 --> 30:16.957
You know something?

30:17.030 --> 30:19.794
You know what
I would like to hear is how
you and Higgins met.

30:19.866 --> 30:21.458
I couldn't. No.

30:21.535 --> 30:24.595
Jonathan doesn't like
to have the story repeated.

30:25.138 --> 30:27.470
Oh, I don't think he'd mind
you telling me.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.600
All right.
It's a good story.

30:29.943 --> 30:32.275
It was in Palestine,
after the war.

30:32.946 --> 30:35.437
You know that Palestine
was then ruled by the British,

30:35.515 --> 30:38.814
and for Jews,
it was impossible
for them to emigrate.

30:38.885 --> 30:41.479
They wouldn't allow it.
Naturally, it didn't stop us.

30:42.155 --> 30:43.383
Naturally.

30:43.457 --> 30:47.257
A few of my friends and I,
we liberated a lifeboat

30:47.327 --> 30:49.625
from that tramp steamer
that we were on,

30:49.696 --> 30:53.723
and under cover of night,
we rowed all the way
to the shore.

30:54.401 --> 30:58.167
When we got there,
there was a British patrol
standing there.

31:00.674 --> 31:01.732
Higgins.

31:01.808 --> 31:05.403
What could we do?
Row out into the sea?
Jump into the water?

31:05.479 --> 31:09.142
You must understand that
the British had a standing
order to shoot on sight.

31:09.216 --> 31:13.915
Well, we landed the boat
and put our fate
in the hands of God.

31:14.788 --> 31:16.881
We sat there for what
seemed like an eternity.

31:16.957 --> 31:19.721
I was looking straight into
that British soldier's face.

31:20.293 --> 31:22.818
I could see the struggle
in his eyes.

31:23.363 --> 31:27.299
And all of a sudden,
he made a smart left turn,
as if he never saw us.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.801
And walked away,
leaving us free to scatter
into the dark, to freedom.

31:34.608 --> 31:37.406
So, Higgins disobeyed
a direct standing order.

31:38.879 --> 31:40.244
Years later,

31:40.313 --> 31:43.146
it was in London,
on Trafalgar Square,
right outside the museum.

31:43.216 --> 31:44.945
I see a face in the crowd.

31:46.153 --> 31:49.350
I get goose pimples all over.
My palms begin to sweat.

31:49.856 --> 31:53.314
I wanted to throw my arms
around him and thank him.

31:53.393 --> 31:55.088
He must've thought
I was <i>meshugge!</i>

31:55.162 --> 31:58.256
I said,
"You were in Palestine!"
He said, "Yes."

31:58.698 --> 32:00.063
This, that,
the other thing, I said,

32:00.133 --> 32:02.829
"How could a British soldier
disobey a standing order?"

32:02.903 --> 32:05.565
And he answered, very calmly,
you know how he speaks.

32:06.239 --> 32:10.107
He said, "I was obeying
a higher law

32:10.177 --> 32:13.169
"that does not
permit me to shoot

32:13.246 --> 32:16.409
"unarmed refugees
looking for a home."

32:31.932 --> 32:36.130
A little piece of that Torah
will always belong
to Jonathan Higgins.

32:38.939 --> 32:40.964
Torah?
Who would steal a Torah?

32:41.041 --> 32:42.975
Well, that's why
we're here, Mr. Shelby.

32:43.043 --> 32:46.171
We were kind of hoping
you could help us
figure that out.

32:48.982 --> 32:51.746
If I may make a suggestion,
Mr. Shelby.

32:52.219 --> 32:55.586
If you keep
your left foot square with
the line of the ball,

32:55.655 --> 32:58.123
keep your head down,
and follow through,

32:58.191 --> 32:59.920
you'll have
much more success.

33:00.594 --> 33:02.118
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm.

33:16.943 --> 33:18.103
Hmm.

33:19.646 --> 33:21.045
Thanks for the tip.

33:21.114 --> 33:22.445
Not at all.

33:22.515 --> 33:24.745
Now, perhaps you'd like
to return the favor?

33:25.518 --> 33:28.214
Maybe.
What do you have in mind?

33:28.288 --> 33:29.755
We were wondering, Mr. Shelby,

33:29.823 --> 33:34.351
why you would give a man
with Mr. Ling's background
access to your handgun?

33:35.996 --> 33:37.520
Believe me, I didn't.

33:37.964 --> 33:41.491
Ling stole the gun
out of my office drawer,

33:42.335 --> 33:44.929
and I don't use it,
so I never realized
it was missing.

33:45.005 --> 33:46.836
I wouldn't trust Dick Ling
with a gun

33:46.906 --> 33:48.771
or much of anything else,
for that matter.

33:48.842 --> 33:50.969
Yeah, but you
gave him a job.

33:51.378 --> 33:52.572
Sure I did.

33:52.646 --> 33:55.809
I give a lot of ex-cons jobs.
Got to give them
a helping hand.

33:55.882 --> 33:58.112
I know it's tough
for them out there.

33:58.184 --> 34:00.414
But I also know
which ones to trust.

34:01.288 --> 34:03.222
Now, you'll have to
pardon me, I'm afraid,

34:03.290 --> 34:06.817
because I have
a very important golf date.
With my banker, no less.

34:06.893 --> 34:09.020
Now, please, hang around,
enjoy yourselves.

34:09.094 --> 34:10.619
Have a drink if you'd like.

34:11.697 --> 34:12.960
Bye-bye, now.

34:16.870 --> 34:18.132
Don't wait up for me.

34:19.539 --> 34:21.563
I don't trust that man.

34:22.175 --> 34:24.643
I'm sorry,
but I don't.

34:44.164 --> 34:46.393
Thomas, please pull over
and stop the car.

34:46.466 --> 34:47.728
What's wrong?

34:47.801 --> 34:50.132
Thomas, please, stop the car.
Pull over, please.

34:59.779 --> 35:01.144
There, now stop.

35:01.481 --> 35:02.743
All right.

35:03.116 --> 35:04.413
Thank you.

35:04.851 --> 35:07.479
Wait a minute, Rabbi,
what's the matter?

35:07.554 --> 35:10.921
It's almost sundown,
and our Sabbath
is about to begin.

35:10.990 --> 35:13.959
Our tradition does not
permit me to ride in the car
on the Sabbath.

35:14.027 --> 35:15.289
I'll see you over
at the estate.

35:15.362 --> 35:18.092
But that's over two miles.
You can't walk all that way.

35:18.164 --> 35:20.098
I'm not an invalid,
thank you.

35:20.166 --> 35:22.794
You see, the Sabbath
is a pillar of our faith,

35:22.969 --> 35:25.961
and we're obligated to honor
the day and keep it holy.

35:26.039 --> 35:27.768
I'll see you over
at the estate.

35:35.749 --> 35:37.216
Wait a minute!

35:50.964 --> 35:52.295
I'll walk with you.

36:12.118 --> 36:13.483
Here, Rabbi.

36:18.158 --> 36:19.352
Amen.

36:21.094 --> 36:22.254
Amen.

36:40.662 --> 36:43.256
Rabbi Solomon, Mr. Magnum,
are you all right?

36:43.531 --> 36:46.989
I think so. I don't suppose
you know anything
about that explosion?

36:47.502 --> 36:48.628
No. What do you mean?

36:48.703 --> 36:51.137
Come on, Miss Chou,
you've been following us
around all day.

36:51.206 --> 36:54.232
Now, that could be
a huge coincidence,
but somehow I doubt it.

36:54.776 --> 36:57.745
It is not what you think.
Would you please
get into the car?

36:57.812 --> 36:59.780
That is very gracious,
Miss Chou,

36:59.848 --> 37:03.909
but the Sabbath has begun,
and I'm not permitted to ride
in a car on the Sabbath.

37:03.985 --> 37:06.954
Rabbi, I must insist
you accept my invitation.

37:07.021 --> 37:09.819
If you want your Torah back,
you must come with me.

37:09.891 --> 37:11.620
We have many thing
to discuss,

37:11.693 --> 37:15.254
including how you smuggled
the Shen Wa rubies
into this country.

37:26.975 --> 37:29.409
The Shen Wa's rubies
are among my country's

37:29.477 --> 37:32.742
most treasured and valuable
historical antiquities.

37:33.014 --> 37:35.983
And you accuse me
of smuggling them
out of Taiwan?

37:36.050 --> 37:38.314
I could never do
such a terrible thing.

37:38.386 --> 37:42.914
You simply
do not understand my feeling
about the legacy of our past.

37:43.358 --> 37:45.019
I think maybe I do.

37:48.296 --> 37:49.888
Do you see this?

37:50.565 --> 37:53.693
It's over 600 years old,
from the Ming dynasty.

37:54.669 --> 37:58.105
Just touching it gives me
a feeling of being connected.

37:59.007 --> 38:01.305
A direct link to my ancestors.

38:01.409 --> 38:04.606
That's very nice.
Is that why you put
a bomb in our car?

38:05.113 --> 38:07.513
Mr. Magnum, if I had
wanted to kill you,

38:07.782 --> 38:10.546
you must admit,
I could have done it
before this.

38:11.219 --> 38:14.586
Over the last few years,
many precious antiquities

38:14.656 --> 38:16.647
have disappeared
from our museum.

38:17.825 --> 38:22.785
Gems, pictures, statues,
and many other <i>objets d'art.</i>

38:22.997 --> 38:25.830
All of which brave men
like my own father

38:25.900 --> 38:28.562
risked their lives to rescue
out of the mainland

38:28.636 --> 38:31.935
before Mao's cultural purge
destroyed them forever.

38:32.840 --> 38:36.867
We have tried desperately
to find the men responsible
for this terrible loss.

38:37.278 --> 38:39.803
And until recently,
we have failed.

38:40.448 --> 38:43.542
So, you see, Rabbi,
I do understand how you feel.

38:46.354 --> 38:49.050
You said,
"Until recently."

38:49.123 --> 38:53.184
That must mean that
you know who they are.

38:53.261 --> 38:55.855
One of them.
Their contact in Taiwan.

38:55.930 --> 38:59.366
And that was the same man
who arranged for your Torah
to be returned to you

38:59.434 --> 39:01.527
with the Shen Wa rubies
inside.

39:02.303 --> 39:06.171
What we didn't know is,
who was on this side?

39:06.407 --> 39:08.807
Who was going to receive
the stolen gems?

39:09.777 --> 39:12.803
So, you knew about
the smuggling operation
and you let it happen.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.507
We had to get
to the key man,

39:14.582 --> 39:18.177
and we thought that
if we exchanged the rubies
with copies and follow them...

39:18.253 --> 39:20.847
And you didn't think
it was all that important
to tell the Rabbi

39:20.922 --> 39:22.981
that the Torah and his life
was in danger?

39:23.057 --> 39:25.116
We never meant to lose
sight of the Torah,

39:25.193 --> 39:27.593
and I'm terribly sorry
it is lost.

39:27.795 --> 39:30.355
Well, the important thing is
to get the Torah back.

39:30.431 --> 39:34.094
We have heard a rumor that
a buyer is in Honolulu,

39:34.168 --> 39:36.398
and tonight he will see
the rubies.

39:36.471 --> 39:41.135
And I had hoped that perhaps
you would find out where
the location is going to be.

39:41.309 --> 39:46.178
And perhaps
we could stop the smugglers
and retrieve the Torah.

39:46.748 --> 39:48.079
Will you help us?

39:52.387 --> 39:53.820
What could it hurt?

39:55.556 --> 39:57.046
Why should we?

39:57.225 --> 39:59.318
We have a saying,

39:59.394 --> 40:02.830
"In order to learn
from the past,

40:03.665 --> 40:06.725
"a man must forgive it."

40:07.468 --> 40:10.266
Thank you.
We have the same saying.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.335
We have a saying, too.

40:13.174 --> 40:15.199
"Once burned, twice shy."

40:20.682 --> 40:22.843
T. C: What makes you think
Shelby put a bomb in your car?

40:22.917 --> 40:24.680
And give me my gun out of
the glove compartment.

40:24.752 --> 40:28.313
Deduction.
It wasn't there when we left
the police department.

40:28.389 --> 40:29.788
That we know for sure.

40:29.857 --> 40:33.224
Yeah. And so, naturally,
you couldn't call the police.

40:33.294 --> 40:35.888
I didn't say that I couldn't
call the police, T.C.

40:35.963 --> 40:38.591
What I said was, if Mia Chou's
information was correct,

40:38.666 --> 40:40.531
the exchange would take
place about midnight.

40:40.601 --> 40:43.035
And they couldn't have
a search warrant by then.

40:43.104 --> 40:44.696
Right. That's what I said.

40:44.772 --> 40:47.832
Yeah. Even if the guy
even has the jewels.

40:47.909 --> 40:49.843
Well, if he didn't
have the jewels,

40:49.911 --> 40:52.880
then why would he
kill Ling and Makula?

40:52.947 --> 40:55.211
The two people who could
have led us to them.

40:55.283 --> 40:56.443
Deduction.

40:56.517 --> 40:57.848
Deductions.

41:00.388 --> 41:01.821
T. C: Thomas, look.

41:29.617 --> 41:32.381
Okay, Rabbi, you wait here
for half an hour.

41:32.453 --> 41:34.751
If we're not out,
call Tanaka.

41:35.123 --> 41:36.317
Do you have a plan?

41:36.391 --> 41:37.619
Of course we have a plan.

41:38.860 --> 41:40.157
Sort of.

42:05.953 --> 42:07.045
It's locked.

42:12.126 --> 42:13.559
Rabbi.

42:14.829 --> 42:16.660
I couldn't wait in the car.

42:22.370 --> 42:24.065
Don't make me ask
again, Shelby.

42:24.138 --> 42:25.503
Where are the rubies?

42:29.243 --> 42:31.234
The Torah, what are they
doing to the Torah?

42:31.312 --> 42:32.643
Shh, they might hear us.

42:32.713 --> 42:34.578
They'll hear you
better inside.

42:35.283 --> 42:36.511
Drop them.

42:56.237 --> 42:57.397
Good work.

42:57.939 --> 43:01.500
Well, Magnum,
may I be so bold as to ask
what you're doing here?

43:02.009 --> 43:05.274
Well, we were just trying to
make sure you wouldn't cut us
out of the rubies deal,

43:05.346 --> 43:08.076
and from the looks of things,
that's exactly what
you're trying to do.

43:08.149 --> 43:11.175
Shelby, what is this stupid
game you're trying to pull?

43:11.619 --> 43:13.143
These gems are
all counterfeit.

43:13.221 --> 43:14.916
What? What are you
talking about?

43:14.989 --> 43:16.320
Look.

43:16.390 --> 43:18.688
I told you they wouldn't
fall for it, Shelby.

43:18.759 --> 43:19.851
You shut up!

43:19.927 --> 43:21.360
Yeah, we tried
to warn him.

43:21.429 --> 43:23.829
Don't listen to them.
These rubies can't be fake.

43:23.898 --> 43:25.923
I've had that Torah
ever since
it got to Hawaii.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.592
Well, what're you
pulling a gun for? Look.

43:27.668 --> 43:29.499
Rabbi, you remember
what they say?

43:30.104 --> 43:32.971
"If you're in the dark,
you can see
what's in the light,

43:33.040 --> 43:36.305
"but if you're in the light,
you can't see
what's in the dark."

43:36.377 --> 43:38.345
They have been in my control
ever since they got here.

43:38.412 --> 43:39.436
What the hell?

44:13.748 --> 44:14.976
Mr. Magnum,

44:15.182 --> 44:16.979
I want to thank you
for all your help,

44:17.051 --> 44:19.246
and for referring me
to Lieutenant Tanaka.

44:19.787 --> 44:21.049
Thank you.

44:22.857 --> 44:27.453
Yeah, but, Magnum,
next time you get into
a mess like this,

44:27.562 --> 44:29.689
don't expect me
to bail you out again.

44:50.084 --> 44:52.518
And just as I was
about to close the deal,

44:52.587 --> 44:55.613
this sniveling reporter
from American Star magazine

44:55.690 --> 44:58.090
tricked Wallen into
signing with them.

44:58.392 --> 45:00.223
It took every ounce
of wile in me

45:00.294 --> 45:03.627
to extract a promise
from them to donate
part of their royalties

45:03.698 --> 45:05.495
to the Children's Hospital.

45:05.700 --> 45:07.531
I mean, I'm most exhausted.

45:08.903 --> 45:10.393
You missed the turn.

45:10.638 --> 45:12.037
No, I didn't.

45:13.474 --> 45:14.771
Where are we going?

45:35.930 --> 45:37.090
Magnum?

45:37.164 --> 45:40.827
Your friend, Asher Solomon,
has something
he'd like to tell you.

45:57.151 --> 45:58.584
Jonathan, come here.

46:02.023 --> 46:03.615
Abraham Pressman.

46:09.130 --> 46:10.620
I don't understand.

46:10.831 --> 46:12.731
There's no reason
why you should.

46:13.434 --> 46:16.597
But 40 years ago,
this Abraham

46:17.071 --> 46:21.235
was on a jammed,
leaking lifeboat off
the coast of Palestine.

46:21.909 --> 46:25.743
Abraham, together
with 20 homeless Jews,
including myself.

46:25.813 --> 46:28.748
Fortunately
for Abraham, and for me,
and for the others,

46:28.816 --> 46:33.446
we landed on a beach in
Palestine that was patrolled
by a British soldier called

46:34.088 --> 46:37.251
Jonathan Quayle Higgins.

46:40.127 --> 46:43.528
Oi, Abraham and I
go back many years.

46:44.231 --> 46:45.459
Shanghai.

46:46.067 --> 46:47.159
Yes, he died.

46:47.234 --> 46:49.600
He passed away on a visit
to his family

46:49.904 --> 46:52.304
before I recovered the Torah.

46:52.807 --> 46:54.900
I wanted you to be here

46:55.309 --> 46:57.573
at the time when I
shared it with him.

46:58.479 --> 47:00.413
Asher, I'm deeply touched.

47:01.782 --> 47:05.582
But bringing the Torah
into a cemetery...

47:05.653 --> 47:08.747
I know, is against the highest
Jewish tradition,

47:09.590 --> 47:12.320
but after all this
Torah has been through,

47:12.393 --> 47:14.987
I think the good Lord above
will forgive us.

47:16.063 --> 47:17.291
Abraham,

47:17.364 --> 47:18.831
Avremele,

47:18.999 --> 47:23.629
this is for you,
and for all of you,
my friends.

47:26.974 --> 47:29.374
And now, we will take
this Torah

47:29.777 --> 47:33.213
to the living.
<i>L'Chaim,</i> Jonathan.

47:34.048 --> 47:35.481
<i>L'Chaim,</i> Asher.

47:37.752 --> 47:38.810
You.

47:40.121 --> 47:41.418
Goodbye, Abraham.
