00:02.903 --> 00:05.437
<i> It is the year 4032,</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:07.839
<i> Man's destruction</i>
<i> of the environment</i>

00:07.841 --> 00:10.008
<i> has created</i>
<i> evolutionary aberrations</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:11.576
<i> known as Abbies...</i>

00:11.578 --> 00:12.778
(screeches)

00:12.780 --> 00:14.613
<i> ...that rule the Earth.</i>

00:14.615 --> 00:16.348
(panting)

00:16.350 --> 00:20.385
<i> One man saw</i>
<i> the catastrophe coming.</i>

00:20.387 --> 00:22.888
<i> He created an ark for mankind,</i>

00:22.890 --> 00:24.389
<i> and selected a chosen few</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:25.957
<i> to sleep for 2,000 years</i>

00:25.959 --> 00:28.693
<i> and defy mankind's extinction.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:32.297
<i> Surrounded by mountains</i>
<i> and protected</i>

00:32.299 --> 00:33.932
<i> by an electric fence,</i>

00:33.934 --> 00:35.967
<i> the last of humanity</i>
<i> left alive on Earth</i>

00:35.969 --> 00:38.570
<i> do their best to survive</i>

00:38.572 --> 00:41.473
<i>in a town called Wayward Pines.</i>

00:44.645 --> 00:47.646
<i> Previously on</i> Wayward Pines...

00:47.648 --> 00:48.980
(screeching)

00:48.982 --> 00:50.482
(grunts)

00:50.484 --> 00:52.484
(gunshots)

00:52.486 --> 00:54.786
(gasping)

00:54.788 --> 00:56.888
We're collecting the weapons
that were commandeered

00:56.890 --> 00:58.657
from the armory
last night.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.659
I won't discover

01:00.661 --> 01:02.794
that you kept some
for yourself?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.062
We should have a baby.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.631
A son to lead.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.567
Or a daughter.

01:08.569 --> 01:11.436
I know we had our problems,
but there were good times, too.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.705
And maybe you can tell me
when I'm coming back home.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.441
In the last two hours,
the Abbies have re-entered

01:16.443 --> 01:18.343
the valley
outside the fence.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.744
THEO:<i> They vastly underestimated</i>
<i> these creatures.</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:21.646
The temporal gyrus for a chimp

01:21.648 --> 01:23.315
is about a third
the size of a human's.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.584
<i> And hers appears to be</i>
<i> double the size of ours.</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:27.819
We've done some preliminary
tests with the female.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.788
And it seems to me--
Did you say "female"?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.756
There's a female Abbie
in this town?

01:31.758 --> 01:34.593
<i> Her palm--</i>
<i> does it have a mark?</i>

01:34.595 --> 01:36.061
This experiment ends now.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.931
Stop!
If you kill her, we all die!

01:41.935 --> 01:44.002
THEO: <i> It's not just
their minds,</i> <i> it's math.</i>

01:44.004 --> 01:45.337
And they have the numbers.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.705
ADAM:
<i> There's over a thousand now.</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:47.973
<i> They are gathering for her.</i>

01:47.975 --> 01:49.040
<i> They are coming for her.</i>

01:49.042 --> 01:51.042
<i> That is what the brand is for.</i>

01:51.044 --> 01:53.378
<i> She is their leader!</i>

01:58.552 --> 02:00.719
JASON:
Good citizens of Wayward Pines,

02:00.721 --> 02:03.522
this is the dawn of a new day.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.691
We must unite as one.

02:06.693 --> 02:08.860
And stand together
against our enemy.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.330
We will not let this threat
outside our walls

02:12.332 --> 02:14.499
drive us into hiding.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.669
We will find peace
in our normal way of life.

02:17.671 --> 02:21.506
This time will pass.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.008
Go to school.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.876
Work hard.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.378
Be happy.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.979
Enjoy your life
in Wayward Pines.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.916
MARIO:
Dr. Yedlin.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.984
Good to see you today.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.352
Kerry.
Dr. Yedlin?

02:34.354 --> 02:35.487
How's your arm?

02:35.489 --> 02:36.588
It's fine, thank you.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.589
What are your next steps?

02:37.591 --> 02:38.590
Since you've now established

02:38.592 --> 02:39.824
the basics of communication?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.326
She's not gonna speak
to us again,

02:41.328 --> 02:42.394
unless she's forced.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.528
But everything you indicated--

02:43.530 --> 02:44.763
Yeah, I was
building a trust.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.065
That was destroyed
with three gunshots.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.419
I have the results
of your examination.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.923
Just say it.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.796
We found trauma.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.965
Some residual
scarring.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.566
Possibly
from the creature attack.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.568
Possibly from something else.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.036
Could be endometriosis,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.472
but, uh, we don't have
the equipment

03:27.474 --> 03:29.874
for that, so...

03:31.745 --> 03:33.778
You wouldn't be able
to carry a child

03:33.780 --> 03:36.314
to term.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.783
I'm sorry.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.823
We're supposed
to have children.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.558
We<i> need</i>

03:46.560 --> 03:48.960
to have children.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.297
I wanted to do my part.

03:52.299 --> 03:55.734
I wanted to contribute.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.469
Or what?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.005
He'll make you disappear
like the others?

04:01.308 --> 04:03.375
(elevator bell dings)

04:04.678 --> 04:06.678
Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.680
After I meet with Jason,
I'll stop by the lab

04:08.682 --> 04:09.914
so you can walk me through

04:09.916 --> 04:10.949
the next steps
of your research.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.317
And if Megan gives you

04:12.319 --> 04:14.386
any trouble,
please let me know.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.732
(elevator bell dings)

04:42.349 --> 04:44.749
(alarm blaring)

05:07.974 --> 05:09.941
(Abbies screeching)

05:19.820 --> 05:21.352
MAN (over P.A.):
This is a code red.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.887
There has been a security breach
in the lab.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.489

05:50.751 --> 05:53.151
KERRY:
Oh, my God!

05:54.755 --> 05:56.521
How did it happen?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.956
Code's on the cage.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.424
She saw us input them
and memorized them.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.859
She wants to get back to them.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.860
And do what?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.629
This.

06:04.631 --> 06:07.832
Revenge for what
we did to them.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.635
Start searching.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.637
Every air duct,

06:12.639 --> 06:15.039
every hallway,
every stairwell.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.093
SOLDIER:
Hallway three clear!

06:35.095 --> 06:37.462
SOLDIER 2:
Hallway four clear!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.533
SOLDIER 3:
Hallway seven clear!

06:42.769 --> 06:44.302
SOLDIER 4:
All floors are clear.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.670
Check the tunnels.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.564
(indistinct radio transmissions)

07:19.005 --> 07:21.573
(faint screaming)
Let's go.

(indistinct radio transmissions)

07:41.695 --> 07:44.095
(faint screaming)

07:51.404 --> 07:52.704
Where is she?

07:58.845 --> 07:59.978
(gasps)

08:09.589 --> 08:10.989
(panting)

08:26.740 --> 08:28.907
♪ ♪

09:15.822 --> 09:17.455
She could've escaped two
minutes ago or two hours ago.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.623
We have to warn the town.
The soldiers will handle it.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.058
What do you think
the rest of them

09:20.060 --> 09:21.426
are out there for?
They're there for her.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.393
They're waiting.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.394
They wouldn't attack

09:23.396 --> 09:24.395
while he had her captive.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.730
We are telling the town now!

09:32.639 --> 09:34.072
He's right.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.307
We'll tell them
the truth.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.742
I can set up two teams--
one to move

09:37.744 --> 09:39.978
around the perimeter
to the south side of town

09:39.980 --> 09:41.679
in case she heads back
to the woods. We still have--

09:41.681 --> 09:43.448
She found her way in,
she's gonna find her way out.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.682
Then we'll move through
the neighborhood systematically.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.017
You have enough men for that?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.618
We'll get people from town
to help in the search.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.320
Unarmed?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.488
They see something,

09:50.490 --> 09:51.923
they'll report it immediately.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.424
We just collected
the rebels' guns.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.659
We can't risk handing
them right back.

09:54.661 --> 09:55.927
JASON:
Dr. Yedlin!

09:55.929 --> 09:57.729
I'm going to find Hassler.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.000
You okay?

10:02.002 --> 10:04.602
I'm fine.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.371
Jason, I--
Kerry.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.873
No matter how smart she is,
we're going to find her.

10:16.883 --> 10:19.784
Hey.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.686
Did you talk to him?

10:21.688 --> 10:23.688
He didn't come home.
Last night at all?

10:23.690 --> 10:25.023
Last two nights.
I don't know where he is.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.057
The hospital, maybe.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.992
Well, is he trying

10:27.994 --> 10:29.894
to avoid you or the
other way around?

10:29.896 --> 10:32.530
(chuckles) What do you
want me to say, Xander?

10:32.532 --> 10:34.332
I'm barely coming to terms
with this myself.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.334
Hey, hey.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.835
Why is this so hard
for you to talk about?

10:37.837 --> 10:40.071
Because we're all
stuck here together,

10:40.073 --> 10:41.639
and I still care about him.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.743
He'll know
it's not his.

10:52.919 --> 10:54.485
I know.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.686
I'll tell him.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.888
Look, it happened.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.123
And now, here we are.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.060
With a baby coming.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.663
That's what I want.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.831
And I think it's what

11:06.833 --> 11:08.800
you want, too.

11:11.838 --> 11:14.739
We can't control
what happens out there,

11:14.741 --> 11:16.507
but in here, we can.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.576

11:34.060 --> 11:35.359
Hello?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.628
(school bell ringing)

11:44.437 --> 11:45.803
There's been an emergency.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.472
Your parents have been notified.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.073
Everyone, head inside.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.541
What's happening?

11:50.543 --> 11:51.809
SIMEON: Don't know.
Head on inside.

11:51.811 --> 11:53.311
Come on.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.579
GIRL:
Oh, my God.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.481
BOY:
What's going on?

11:56.483 --> 11:57.715
BOY 2:
Is this for real?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.083
GIRL 2:
So strange.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.752
(bell continues ringing)
Head on in; don't push.

12:01.754 --> 12:04.088
ICE CREAM TRUCK: Attention, citizens
of Wayward Pines. (phone ringing)

12:04.090 --> 12:05.823
Please move inside.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.792
Lock the doors.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.894
An Abby has escaped from the
superstructure. (phone ringing)

12:09.896 --> 12:11.395
If you something...
What?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.663
...report it immediately.
Oh, my God.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.900
Hurry up.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.802
Attention, citizens of
Wayward Pines... Run.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.637
Please move inside.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.805
Lock the doors.
Get inside.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.440
(phones ringing)

12:22.442 --> 12:23.641
Come on, we'll go
to the dorms.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.842
Is this is?
Are we dead?

12:24.844 --> 12:26.644
No.
You can do whatever you want,

12:26.646 --> 12:27.812
and you're going
back to the dorms?

12:27.814 --> 12:29.680
That's what they said to do.

12:29.682 --> 12:30.915
Ah, they say a lot of things.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.316
We got a big electric fence.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.818
Abbies aren't getting in.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.354
Except when they build
one of those ladder things.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.688
Hey.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.757
If it is the end
of the world,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.160
I'm not spending it
hiding in a basement.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.429
I want to see Rebecca.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.631
Luce...

12:46.633 --> 12:47.965
I'm scared.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.367
Look, we have to go
back inside, okay?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.968
She makes me feel better
about these things, please.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.537
(sighs)

12:54.040 --> 12:55.673
Okay, okay,
I'll walk you.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.375
(phones ringing)

12:57.377 --> 13:00.645
Get inside. Get inside.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.812
(engine revving)
Hey, everybody!

13:01.814 --> 13:03.981
Off the street now.
Come on!

13:03.983 --> 13:05.383
Come on!

13:05.385 --> 13:06.617
Hurry up.
Come on.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.319
Get inside.
Go, go, go.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.987
Hurry!

13:09.989 --> 13:12.857
Attention, citizens
of Wayward Pines.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.692
Please move inside.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.327
Lock the doors.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.062
An Abby has escaped
from the superstructure.

13:18.064 --> 13:21.866

wouldn't she just try
to sneak back out the same way?

21:02.828 --> 21:05.863
If she's trying
to sneak out.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.765

22:01.854 --> 22:03.120

22:07.927 --> 22:09.426
you have a little victory dance

22:09.428 --> 22:10.761
on Main Street?

22:10.763 --> 22:11.895
She's not a trophy.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.067

You work at
Wayward Beauty.

salon has clearance.

23:28.474 --> 23:30.307
The original geological surveys.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.441
They'll help in the search.

abandoned tunnel.
