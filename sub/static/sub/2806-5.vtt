WEBVTT

00:03.253 --> 00:04.378
Hey.

00:04.546 --> 00:07.214
- What's the matter?
- Someone on the subway licked my neck!

00:07.382 --> 00:11.176
- Licked my neck!
- Whoa! Willy's still alive.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.929
- What are you doing?
- My mom called.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.807
They're gonna run our engagement
announcement in the paper.

00:16.975 --> 00:21.061
- We're looking for a good picture.
- Ooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.814
Not true. There are great pictures of us.

00:23.982 --> 00:28.152
No, there are great pictures of you
next to a guy who's going like this...

00:29.696 --> 00:33.157
Oh, my God, that's the creep that
you're with at the Statue of Liberty.

00:35.368 --> 00:38.078
I don't know what it is.
I just can't take a good picture.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.788
Oh, here's a great one.

00:39.998 --> 00:44.418
- Yeah, I'm not in that.
- No, but look at me, all tan.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.088
Why don't you get portraits done
by a professional photographer?

00:48.256 --> 00:51.550
That's a great idea. I bet they have
one of those wind machines, like:

00:54.304 --> 00:57.473
Yeah, that's great. Next to that,
Chandler won't look so stupid.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.394
- Chandler, what do you say?
- All right, but I should warn you.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.313
I'm not going. I'm going.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.021
Dude, that reverse lay-up. Ugh!

01:46.231 --> 01:48.482
- And how about those three-pointers?
- Amazing.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.611
And those guys were this close
to letting us play this time too.

01:56.449 --> 02:00.202
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking
to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.

02:00.370 --> 02:05.290
You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"?
We call him "Hums While He Pees."

02:05.500 --> 02:08.877
Yes, and we call Ross
"Lingers in the Bathroom."

02:09.963 --> 02:13.423
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees"
just asked me out.

02:14.884 --> 02:18.053
- I thought that guy was married.
- He is, but he's getting divorced.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.013
Ross, maybe you know him.

02:22.892 --> 02:24.518
It's not a club.

02:25.353 --> 02:29.022
If this guy's going through a divorce,
is it a good idea to go out with him?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.066
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.694
They have that that on the napkins
at the club.

02:35.196 --> 02:39.032
- Oh, I gotta get back to work.
- You don't have to be back for a half-hour.

02:39.200 --> 02:43.287
My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups
in the office during lunch. Heh.

02:43.788 --> 02:47.040
Ugh, I could just spread him
on a cracker.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.420
If you have a crush on this guy,
why would you hire him?

02:51.588 --> 02:54.506
- You know you can't date him, right?
- Oh, no, I know that.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.676
Although we made a joke
that we spend so much time together...

02:57.844 --> 02:59.720
...he should call me his "work-wife."

02:59.888 --> 03:04.141
Soon he'll be able to call you
"that lady he knew that got fired."

03:04.767 --> 03:08.020
I'm not gonna get fired,
because I'm not gonna act on it.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.397
You wouldn't mind
if he was dating someone?

03:10.565 --> 03:15.277
Why, is he? He is, isn't he?
He's dating that slut in marketing.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.072
Maybe I should open
a divorced men's club.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.742
Dude, that's so sad.

03:21.910 --> 03:25.412
- I could put a basketball court in the back.
- Heh.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.914
Could I play?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.589
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?

03:36.007 --> 03:39.426
- I just did them.
- Oh, well, drop and give me 10 more. Heh.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.012
What?

03:42.222 --> 03:45.515
I had a drink with lunch. Did those, um...?

03:45.683 --> 03:49.061
- Did those cost reports come in?
- Yeah, I filled them out last night.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.146
Oh, great. Could you make me 4 copies?

03:51.314 --> 03:53.148
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.161
Huh.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.250
Ah.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.797
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi. Hi, Melissa. What's up?

04:16.964 --> 04:21.051
I'm just about to, um, go out to the store.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.512
Get some stuff to put in my backpack.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.598
You know, like dried fruit and granola,
and stuff like that.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.184
- Um, what's up?
- Is Tag here?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.311
- No. Why?
- Oh, I was gonna talk to him...

04:31.479 --> 04:34.731
...about doing something tonight.
- Really?

04:34.899 --> 04:37.526
You got a little crush
on Tag there, do you?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.570
Well, we've been flirting back and forth...

04:40.738 --> 04:44.783
...but I was hoping tonight it would
turn into something a little more than that.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.870
Okay, whoa, whoa. Easy there, Melissa.
This ain't a locker room, okay.

04:50.957 --> 04:56.336
But you know, I remember him saying
that he had plans tonight.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.839
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.758
All right, back to work.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.761
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?

05:05.972 --> 05:09.099
Yeah, Melissa, I don't want to be known
as the, uh, office bitch...

05:09.267 --> 05:11.101
...but I will call your supervisor.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.570
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.448
Now, Chandler,
you want to give us a smile?

05:24.615 --> 05:25.949
Okay.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.040
- I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
- No, I am.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.877
Chandler, I know you can do this.
You have a beautiful smile.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.171
- I do?
- Yeah.

05:41.132 --> 05:45.135
All right, maybe you don't have to smile.
Let's try something else. Let's try, um...

05:45.303 --> 05:47.888
- Try looking sexy.
- Okay.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.854
Or not.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.362
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?

06:03.529 --> 06:07.240
I got an audition down the street,
and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.

06:08.701 --> 06:12.496
- You got an extra one?
- Yeah, sure. Um...

06:14.415 --> 06:15.582
Here.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.209
Great.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.587
You got anything
that's not Ralph Lauren?

06:22.507 --> 06:24.174
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.886
I guess this'll be fine.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.431
- Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight?
- Nothing. Why?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.059
How would you feel about
taking out my assistant Tag?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.769
- I'll pay.
- Heh.

06:35.937 --> 06:40.190
It's gonna take a lot of money for
me to go out on a date with a dude.

06:41.692 --> 06:44.611
I'm not asking you to go on
a date with him.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.739
Really? Because I could kind of
use the money.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.536
Joey, just... He's new in town
and he doesn't have any guy friends.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.747
Take him to a ball game or something.
I'd appreciate it.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.166
- Yeah, okay, no problem.
- Thank you.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.836
- Ooh, hey, doughnuts!
- Uh-huh.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.097
I know. Let's try a look...

07:12.348 --> 07:14.683
...of far-off wonderment.

07:14.976 --> 07:20.397
Gaze into our future and think about
our marriage and the days to come.

07:26.195 --> 07:29.364
Chandler, what is the matter
with your face?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.534
This picture's supposed to say
"Geller and Bing to be married"...

07:32.743 --> 07:35.829
...not "Local woman
saves drowning moron."

07:36.414 --> 07:38.623
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, don't laugh at him.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.209
He's my drowning moron.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.588
- Aw.
- That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!

07:50.428 --> 07:51.511
I like this one.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.515
It seems to say, "I love you
and that's why I have to kill you."

07:58.019 --> 07:59.478
Can't all be bad.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.148
Find the one where you make
your bedroom eyes.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.357
Oh, there it is.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.944
Oh, my God,
those are my bedroom eyes?

08:08.654 --> 08:10.906
Why did you ever sleep with me?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.659
Do you really want to pull
at that thread?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.374
- I'm having a really good time.
- Me too.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.960
Sorry that guy on the subway
licked your neck.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.545
Oh!

08:25.838 --> 08:28.173
No, that's okay. He's a friend.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.509
Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...

08:30.718 --> 08:33.803
...but I have tickets to the
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.679
Yeah, I...

08:35.932 --> 08:40.143
Well, I missed the semifinals,
so I think I would just be lost.

08:40.311 --> 08:44.356
Heh, I know that it's lame,
but I got these tickets from my boss...

08:44.524 --> 08:47.192
Oh, no, no, no, my God!

08:47.401 --> 08:50.028
- Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
- No, it's...

08:50.196 --> 08:51.780
My ex-wife Whitney is out there.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.950
I cannot deal with her now.
That woman is crazy.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.743
Okay, I know. Hold on.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.162
- Hey, Ross.
- Yeah.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.958
Yeah. Um, that's Whitney,
Kyle's ex-wife out there.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.878
Do you think you could divert her
so we could slip out?

09:07.046 --> 09:09.130
What? No.

09:10.216 --> 09:14.344
Okay, but I have two tickets
to the ballroom-dance finals.

09:14.512 --> 09:17.847
I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh...

09:19.767 --> 09:22.143
All right, I'll do it.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.147
- But just because you're a friend.
- Okay.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.494
Aah!

09:40.204 --> 09:42.038
Hi, Ginger.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.873
I want my key back.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.710
- I don't have it.
- It's right there.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.045
Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.090
I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.

09:52.258 --> 09:55.427
All right. I just wanted to thank you
for diverting Kyle's ex.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.597
Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome.
We'll, uh, talk about it later.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.056
- Okay.
- Heh.

10:00.224 --> 10:03.268
- Hi, Whitney.
- Hi, Ross.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.605
- Are you ready for breakfast?
- Yep. Ooh.

10:08.316 --> 10:12.444
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed
to divert her, not date her.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.740
Sorry, can you give me a second
while I talk to this woman...

10:16.907 --> 10:19.451
...uh, who, by the way,
did not spend the night?

10:20.578 --> 10:23.246
- Sure.
- Okay. Eh, heh...

10:25.041 --> 10:28.710
I did divert her, and we ended up
having a great time, okay?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.462
- Watching ballroom dancing?
- Yes.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.798
That's where we realized
we are both super cool people.

10:35.176 --> 10:39.137
Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me
some really bad stuff about her.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.848
- Like what?
- Like she's really mean.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.768
And she's overly critical and... And... No.

10:44.935 --> 10:49.606
She will paint a room a really bright
color without even checking with you.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.817
Okay.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.154
And she uses sex as a weapon.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.781
Fine. Thank you for warning me.

10:57.948 --> 11:02.786
At breakfast, I'll be on full alert
for room painting and sex weapons.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.706
- You're still gonna go out with her?
- Yeah.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.376
Well, didn't you hear
what I just said?

11:09.669 --> 11:12.629
Pheebs, come on.
I mean, consider the source.

11:12.880 --> 11:16.800
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say
that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.260
No, listen to me, she is crazy!

11:20.304 --> 11:23.598
Uh, your door isn't soundproof.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.353
You see? Nothing is good enough
for her.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.401
- Morning.
- Hi, Tag.

11:34.568 --> 11:37.362
Hey, so did you have fun with,
uh, Joey last night?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.197
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.116
Aw, that's nice.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.828
Then we went to this bar, and he
hooked us up with all these women.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.126
Women? You mean, like old women?

11:52.044 --> 11:54.087
Kind of old, like 30.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.970
- Oh.
- I never used to be able...

12:02.138 --> 12:03.888
...to just talk to girls in bars...

12:04.056 --> 12:07.225
...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers
last night.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.812
That's great.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.482
Oh, man. So Joey must have
really taught you some stuff.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.818
- A little.
- Yeah.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.112
How you doing?

12:26.871 --> 12:31.458
See? That's a great smile.
Easy, natural.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.543
Now pretend I have a camera.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.047
- You're changing it.
- I can't help it.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.718
All right. You want to know what I do
when I take résumé shots?

12:41.969 --> 12:43.887
Borrow money from me?

12:45.097 --> 12:49.768
Yeah. Okay, first of all,
you want to make it look spontaneous.

12:50.019 --> 12:54.522
So here's what I do. I look down,
look down, keep looking down.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.191
Then I look up.

12:58.986 --> 13:00.570
See? All right, now you try.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.032
Look down. You're looking down.
Keep looking down.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.284
Why is there jelly on your shoe?

13:07.119 --> 13:08.536
- I had a doughnut.
- Oh.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.123
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.502
So, I heard you had some fun
with Tag last night.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.045
Yeah, that guy's all right.

13:17.213 --> 13:21.299
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him
how to be all "Joey."

13:22.301 --> 13:24.469
- What?
- You know, all the women.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.388
You can't teach someone
to be good with women.

13:27.556 --> 13:30.183
That's why I never had
any luck with Chandler.

13:35.689 --> 13:37.899
I'm right here.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.487
Would you mind just not
going out with him again?

13:42.696 --> 13:46.032
Just the idea of you and he
and all these women...

13:46.242 --> 13:48.660
I know he's my assistant,
and I can't date him, blah!

13:48.911 --> 13:50.703
But it bothers me, all right?

13:50.871 --> 13:53.540
No, no, no, you can't take him
away from me.

13:53.749 --> 13:57.502
I got a great partner to pick up
girls with. Finally!

14:01.757 --> 14:03.967
I'm still right here.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.427
All right, will you talk to him...

14:06.595 --> 14:11.140
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.351
What?

14:14.812 --> 14:18.189
I don't want him to meet anybody
until I'm over my crush.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.691
And I will get over it.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.861
It's not like I love him. It's just physical.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.948
I get these crushes all the time.
Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.992
I know. Monica told me.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.954
Did you have a crush on me
when you first met me?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.208
Yeah, sure.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.590
Can you people not see me?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.219
So will you talk to him?

14:48.429 --> 14:52.265
- I don't know, Rach.
- I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.

14:52.474 --> 14:53.850
One.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.728
No, 10. You said 10.
You can't take that back.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.362
Hey. You wanted to talk to me?

15:06.530 --> 15:08.907
I don't know.
You, uh, got something for me?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.658
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.748
Ten. Okay.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.250
Tag, there's such a thing
as too many women.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.170
- Really?
- Yeah, for you.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.386
- Hey, there you are.
- There I am.

15:30.679 --> 15:34.140
- You okay?
- Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.142
So he gave me an antihistamine.

15:36.852 --> 15:37.936
- What?
- Yeah.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.813
Then I fell asleep on the subway
and went to Brooklyn.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.399
Brooklyn is far.

15:44.526 --> 15:45.777
What were you thinking?

15:45.986 --> 15:49.656
But don't worry, because
I know how to take a picture now.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.785
Okay, see. Look down.

15:54.036 --> 15:58.122
Look down.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.630
- Chandler?
- Yeah?

16:11.428 --> 16:13.763
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.976
So how are things going with Crazy?
Has she cooked your rabbit yet?

16:18.936 --> 16:22.313
Listen, you are hearing one side
of the story. Okay?

16:22.481 --> 16:26.234
FYI, she must have shown Kyle
over 30 paint samples...

16:26.402 --> 16:27.986
...before she painted that room.

16:29.488 --> 16:34.283
And his response to each one was,
"I don't give a tiny rat's ass."

16:34.702 --> 16:37.787
Maybe she should have spent
a little less time decorating...

16:38.038 --> 16:40.331
...and a little more time
in the bedroom.

16:40.874 --> 16:43.543
I don't think we are going
to have that problem...

16:43.711 --> 16:47.505
...but maybe that's because I am not
emotionally unavailable.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.299
You think he's emotionally unavailable?

16:50.467 --> 16:52.552
I think he can be.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.721
Maybe he wouldn't be...

16:54.888 --> 16:57.348
...if she didn't bring the office
home every night.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.893
Well excuse her for knowing
what she wants to do with her life.

17:01.061 --> 17:05.272
Well, she certainly knew what
she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.

17:06.066 --> 17:09.444
I knew you were gonna
throw that in my face!

17:09.737 --> 17:13.531
That was three years ago.
She apologized and apologized.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.117
What more do you want?

17:16.410 --> 17:18.911
We want the last six years back!

17:19.079 --> 17:21.955
So do we! So do we!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.838
I'm sorry you had to see that.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.552
- Morning, Rachel.
- Hi.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.971
Hey, so, uh, what'd you do last night?

17:37.139 --> 17:38.931
- Went out with Joey.
- Oh, yeah?

17:39.099 --> 17:42.810
Another night of bird-dogging
the chicas?

17:43.479 --> 17:47.482
- No, we had a really good talk.
- Oh.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.068
I don't think I'm gonna do
that bar scene anymore.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.237
Wow, I did not see that coming.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.740
It's just not really who I am.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.409
No, I've always been happier when...

17:58.660 --> 18:00.078
Why am I telling you this?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.747
- You don't care about this stuff.
- Yes, I do. I do.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.376
Go on. You were saying,
"I'm happier when I'm..."

18:07.544 --> 18:09.128
When I'm in a relationship.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.547
- I love having a girlfriend.
- Really?

18:11.715 --> 18:14.050
Yeah. Someone I can spoil, you know.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.677
- Sp... Spoil?
- Uh-huh.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.848
- Let me ask you something.
- Uh-huh?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.935
Do you believe there's one perfect
person for everyone?

18:24.728 --> 18:26.604
I'm starting to.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.650
If that person's in your life,
you should do something about it?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.443
Yes. Hell, yes.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.987
- All right, then, it's settled.
- Okay.

18:35.155 --> 18:38.449
- I'm getting back together with my ex.
- I would love to!

18:38.992 --> 18:40.159
What?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.040
Hello?

18:47.000 --> 18:50.169
Oh. This is gonna be a while.
Excuse me.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.964
Um, yeah.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.966
Yeah.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.062
My God!

19:09.731 --> 19:11.691
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.819
And speaking of being selfish in bed,
how's Whitney?

19:16.613 --> 19:19.115
Maybe she wouldn't have to be
selfish in bed...

19:19.283 --> 19:22.493
...if someone else knew where
everything was.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.454
Oh, he knows. Heh.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.290
For the most part.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.044
Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.

19:32.462 --> 19:34.172
We kind of need to talk.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.674
- Both of you together?
- What's up?

19:36.842 --> 19:40.928
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night
to pick up a few things...

19:41.096 --> 19:44.056
...and we got to reminiscing.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.892
We talked most of the night...

19:46.059 --> 19:49.020
...and realized the reason
we're angry with each other...

19:49.188 --> 19:52.732
...is because there are still
feelings there.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.443
So...

19:58.030 --> 19:59.697
Oh, just say it, Kyle!

20:02.910 --> 20:04.785
We're gonna give it another try.

20:04.953 --> 20:08.581
What about her whining,
and her constant need for attention?

20:08.749 --> 20:09.957
I'm gonna work on that.

20:10.125 --> 20:12.418
Oh, right, because you're so
capable of change.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.088
You know, he hums when he pees.

20:18.050 --> 20:22.386
- I do know.
- Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.348
We're so sorry.

20:26.183 --> 20:30.019
That's all right. We don't need you.
I'm over it already.

20:30.187 --> 20:33.397
Yeah, and I don't even give
a tiny rat's ass.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.734
Yeah, we're gonna go.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.531
I'm sorry.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.866
Agh.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.203
Pheebs, you were right about her.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.123
You know, she did try to use
sex as a weapon.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.417
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.965
You know, he hums while he does
other stuff too.

21:01.093 --> 21:04.470
- We're better off without them.
- Heh.

21:04.846 --> 21:09.141
Even if they break up again, you better
not let him in your sad men's club.

21:09.309 --> 21:12.603
- Divorced men's club.
- Potato, "potato."

21:18.777 --> 21:19.902
Hey, guys, check it out.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.948
- My mom sent me the paper.
- Ooh, let's see it. Yay.

21:24.783 --> 21:29.161
- Oh, yeah, that looks good.
- You make a very attractive couple.

21:32.165 --> 21:35.751
- Yeah, we look great together.
- We really do.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.712
Okay.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.464
Imagine what our kids would look like.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.258
You know, we don't have to imagine.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.012
I'm marrying her.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.888
We'll just see.
