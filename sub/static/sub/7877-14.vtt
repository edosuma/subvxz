00:33.800 --> 00:35.708
Okay, the Langley
Falls Shopping Mall

00:35.776 --> 00:37.953
Memorial Day sale
begins in two hours.

00:38.021 --> 00:39.530
Are you ready for
this, Francine?

00:39.598 --> 00:41.640
Sure, I'm ready.
You don't look ready.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.017
I've been up for five hours
doing stuff like this.

00:45.895 --> 00:47.702
Honey, why are you up
so early?

00:47.769 --> 00:49.705
I'm doing surveillance
down at the docks.

00:49.773 --> 00:51.141
Gonna bust
some gun smugglers.

00:51.208 --> 00:52.647
Then maybe I'll come
to the mall,

00:52.715 --> 00:54.118
and just girl out
with you two.

00:54.186 --> 00:55.659
Hope I don't get
my period.

00:55.727 --> 00:57.267
Love you!
Traveling pants!

00:57.335 --> 00:59.172
There's nothing
girlie about it.

00:59.242 --> 01:00.713
I want a turtleneck
like Stan's.

01:00.780 --> 01:01.850
I'll get it
at Baby Gap.

01:01.918 --> 01:03.325
Extra small.

01:03.393 --> 01:05.434
I want to feel like I'm
being choked a little bit.

01:09.484 --> 01:10.887
That was amazing.

01:10.955 --> 01:12.224
It was way better
last year.

01:12.295 --> 01:13.431
You don't even know.

01:13.499 --> 01:14.736
I gave a toddler
a concussion.

01:14.803 --> 01:15.807
Now you know.

01:15.874 --> 01:17.814
Well, I am exhausted.

01:17.882 --> 01:19.455
Hey! No!

01:19.523 --> 01:21.958
Thief! Roger, help!

01:23.427 --> 01:24.362
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

01:24.429 --> 01:25.398
Oh, please, no.

01:25.466 --> 01:26.702
No, no, no!

01:26.770 --> 01:29.445
Whoa! I'm falling!

01:29.513 --> 01:31.485
Somebody, please!

01:31.553 --> 01:33.458
My name is Clive Trotter,

01:33.526 --> 01:35.832
and I'm an American,
and I am in trouble!

01:41.585 --> 01:42.987
This could be it.

01:43.055 --> 01:44.426
Well?

01:44.494 --> 01:46.330
Well, she
only had three puppies,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.638
so I'm afraid you
can't have one.

01:48.706 --> 01:50.008
Aw...

01:50.076 --> 01:51.781
Damn it. Just more puppy talk.

01:53.085 --> 01:54.623
Hello.

01:54.690 --> 01:56.026
Francine?

01:59.370 --> 02:01.710
I'm so freaked out,
I couldn't even make tea.

02:01.778 --> 02:02.947
There's nothing
in my mug,

02:03.014 --> 02:04.485
but the sipping noises
calm me.

02:06.056 --> 02:08.061
Ah. Nothing.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.666
Francine, you shouldn't
be out at night

02:09.734 --> 02:11.202
without a man
escorting you.

02:11.270 --> 02:13.710
Hey, I was escorting her,
and I was dressed like a man.

02:13.778 --> 02:15.047
It takes more than a wig

02:15.114 --> 02:17.185
and a fake bulge
to be a man, Roger.

02:17.253 --> 02:19.124
Men are strong,
honorable and brave.

02:19.192 --> 02:20.562
You're none of
those things.

02:20.630 --> 02:22.232
You just turned
and ran away.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.570
Disgraceful.

02:23.638 --> 02:25.642
Hell, Klaus is more
of a man than you are.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.178
Hey, a shout-out
for Klaus.

02:27.246 --> 02:28.583
That's rare.

02:28.651 --> 02:30.655
You know what, I'm not going
to push the conversation.

02:30.723 --> 02:32.660
I'm just going
to chalk this up as a W.

02:32.728 --> 02:33.696
Shut up, Klaus.

02:33.764 --> 02:35.133
And I broke even.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.537
Quiet, Klaus!
And I blew it.

02:36.605 --> 02:39.878
Roger, stop throwing
out your costumes.

02:39.946 --> 02:41.381
Stan was just upset.

02:41.449 --> 02:43.319
He didn't mean those
things he said.

02:43.387 --> 02:44.557
No, he was right.

02:44.625 --> 02:45.893
I am weak.

02:45.961 --> 02:48.165
I'm not even fit
to wear man clothes.

02:48.233 --> 02:51.975
Good-bye, Vince Monaco,
legendary firehouse prankster.

02:52.042 --> 02:55.015
Your days of putting condoms
in lasagna are over.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.120
Sweetie, I don't blame
you for happened.

02:57.188 --> 02:58.524
Well, you should.

02:58.592 --> 03:01.062
I'm just a silly little hen,
and everybody knows it.

03:02.901 --> 03:05.339
I'm going to miss you
most of all, Jon Goodhorse,

03:05.406 --> 03:07.777
Native American activist
and sex offender.

03:07.845 --> 03:11.246
You were...
you were complicated.

03:11.314 --> 03:14.282
Did not respond well
to the word "no."

03:16.718 --> 03:18.252
Reginald, hey.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.188
I thought the CIA sent you
on a mission to Afghanistan.

03:21.255 --> 03:23.757
Nah, not enough people signed
up, so they canceled it.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.859
If it's okay,
I'm going to do a couple loads.

03:25.927 --> 03:27.864
Drr in my building
is too rough on my delicates.

03:27.932 --> 03:30.199
Hey, you know, that
sounds like a song.

03:30.267 --> 03:33.035
♪ Don't be rough
on my delicates. ♪

03:33.103 --> 03:35.170
Anyway...

03:35.238 --> 03:36.705
Listen, Reginald.

03:36.773 --> 03:38.907
I never had a chance
to say I'm sorry

03:38.975 --> 03:40.809
for trying to kiss
you the other night.

03:40.876 --> 03:42.577
I was drunk
and stupid.

03:42.645 --> 03:43.979
It-it'll never
happen again.

03:44.046 --> 03:45.346
Girl, don't even sweat it.

03:45.414 --> 03:46.747
That was the liquor talking,

03:46.815 --> 03:49.549
and liquor loves talking
to my cute ass.

03:49.617 --> 03:51.986
So, how are things
with Rhonda?

03:52.053 --> 03:53.320
Oh, she's good. Yeah.

03:53.388 --> 03:55.122
She just leased a Ford Focus.
She's good.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.990
Hey, well, I'm still seeing Ian.

03:57.058 --> 03:59.192
The four of us should go
double date sometime.

03:59.259 --> 04:00.492
Oh, we should go
to Houlihan's.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.161
They got
good drinks there.

04:02.228 --> 04:04.296
Daiquiris, margaritas.

04:04.363 --> 04:06.031
And you can take
the glass home

04:06.099 --> 04:07.467
and do whatever
you want with it.

04:07.535 --> 04:09.803
Fill it with M&M'S,
put a rose up in there.

04:09.871 --> 04:12.139
They don't care.
It's your glass!

04:12.206 --> 04:13.540
Okay.

04:14.942 --> 04:17.377
Steve, you have to help me.

04:17.444 --> 04:19.644
I can't stop thinking
about what happened.

04:19.713 --> 04:22.214
Francine got mugged,
and I just sat there.

04:22.282 --> 04:24.416
I was useless and pathetic
and weak.

04:24.484 --> 04:26.887
How do y live with yourself
when y feel that way?

04:26.955 --> 04:28.355
Well, I guess most
people just...

04:28.423 --> 04:29.990
No, I'm talking
about you specifically.

04:30.057 --> 04:32.325
How do <i>you,</i> Steve,
live wh yourself?

04:32.393 --> 04:33.593
Charming.

04:33.661 --> 04:35.361
This side of you
is charmg.

04:35.429 --> 04:37.063
Now I have to take
a long Rollerblade

04:37.130 --> 04:38.930
and sweat out
your poison.

04:38.998 --> 04:40.298
He was no help.

04:40.366 --> 04:41.732
That's tast time I...

04:41.800 --> 04:43.100
No way! <i>Hoosiers!</i>

04:43.168 --> 04:45.301
Oh, damn, it's on TNT.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.565
Commercials.

04:46.632 --> 04:48.465
Well, if that's the price
I gotta pay

04:48.564 --> 04:50.829
to watch a basketball movie
without any blacks in it...

04:50.896 --> 04:53.459
MAN Tired of being
weak and helpless?

04:53.524 --> 04:56.456
Join the tradition of streng,
honor and avery.

04:56.524 --> 04:58.691
Join the Laney Falls
Police Academy.

04:58.759 --> 05:00.760
We're looking
r Langley's finest.

05:00.828 --> 05:03.128
We're looking for you.

05:03.196 --> 05:04.463
Me?

05:04.530 --> 05:06.264
Okay, Roger,
I'm going.

05:08.332 --> 05:11.099
I know, I should have put
my blades on outside.

05:11.167 --> 05:12.500
Yo this,
dot you?

05:12.568 --> 05:14.301
You're loving this.

05:16.470 --> 05:20.139
You are a
stone-cold bastard.

05:23.848 --> 05:24.881
♪ Ta-da! ♪

05:24.949 --> 05:26.816
I joined
the police academy.

05:26.884 --> 05:28.084
They're going
to teach me how

05:28.152 --> 05:30.252
to be strong and tough,
like a real man.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.720
Put your hands
on your fanny.

05:31.788 --> 05:33.855
You have the right
to remain horny.

05:35.124 --> 05:37.058
That was a joke--
an excellent joke--

05:37.126 --> 05:38.526
but I'm serious
about this.

05:38.593 --> 05:39.727
You look ridiculous.

05:39.794 --> 05:41.061
Oh, do I?

05:41.129 --> 05:43.430
Once upon a time,
there was a little alien

05:43.497 --> 05:45.465
who went to the police academy.

05:53.672 --> 05:55.706
<i>Had to blow up</i>
<i>the kitchen, Franny.</i>

05:55.774 --> 05:58.075
<i>It goes real well</i>
<i>with this thing I'm imagining.</i>

06:01.983 --> 06:03.950
You joined the
police academy, Roger?

06:04.018 --> 06:05.818
Sounds pretty badass.

06:05.852 --> 06:07.186
Steve! Language.

06:07.254 --> 06:08.354
Shut the up,
Franny.

06:08.421 --> 06:09.555
The boy's
expressing himself.

06:09.622 --> 06:11.656
Steve, it's
extremely badass.

06:11.724 --> 06:13.958
I am never going
to get pushed around again.

06:14.026 --> 06:16.027
Ha! You'll never
make it, Roger.

06:16.128 --> 06:17.661
Hey, you know how many
<i>Police Academy</i> movies

06:17.729 --> 06:19.096
I watched to
prepare for this?

06:19.164 --> 06:21.364
None, 'cause I knew I'd
pick up some bad habits.

06:21.432 --> 06:23.466
Anyway, I'm going to
do great. u'll see.

06:26.069 --> 06:28.435
Stop splashing me!

06:30.104 --> 06:32.269
My piece!

06:35.501 --> 06:36.801
What a dayhuh?

06:36.869 --> 06:39.103
What about you?
How you holding up?

06:40.271 --> 06:41.404
Lucas, how'd you do?

06:41.472 --> 06:42.738
Oh, that's excellent.

06:42.806 --> 06:44.106
I probably got
an A, though.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.774
You should study
with me next time.

06:45.841 --> 06:47.642
Maybe order in a pizza
and a two-liter.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.410
What do you like,
Sprite? I sure do.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.579
What?! No way!

06:54.081 --> 06:55.547
Wait, why is this wrong?

06:55.615 --> 06:58.016
Next to "Miranda rights,"
I put, "Miranda has the right

06:58.084 --> 07:00.451
to a decent man who will
helper raise her baby."

07:00.518 --> 07:02.685
Are these questions
not about <i>Sex and the City?</i>

07:02.753 --> 07:05.154
Lucas, why won't you tell me
what kind of soda you like?!

07:07.823 --> 07:09.457
I'm so glad Ian and I
could finally get together

07:09.524 --> 07:10.958
with you guys and do this.

07:11.026 --> 07:12.426
I am starving.

07:12.493 --> 07:14.094
That's 'cause all
you've eaten all day

07:14.161 --> 07:15.229
is a BLT, silly girl.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.672
Oop, got your napkin.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.446
Hope you don't order
finger foods.

07:19.513 --> 07:22.490
Well,  I do, I'll just
wipe my hands on your fur.

07:22.557 --> 07:25.829
Oh, see,
now you're getting brave.

07:29.933 --> 07:32.534
I'm going to try
the meatballs.

07:32.602 --> 07:33.802
Huh?

07:33.870 --> 07:36.337
Oh, yeah, baby,
I was looking at that, too.

07:36.405 --> 07:38.207
Did you bring
your Zantac?

07:38.274 --> 07:39.208
What, they can't know?

07:39.276 --> 07:40.275
It's acid reflux.

07:40.343 --> 07:41.710
I mean, you don't take
that pill,

07:41.778 --> 07:43.478
they're going
to find out soon enough.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.714
Rhonda's got
acid reflux.

07:54.455 --> 07:55.855
What the hell?

07:59.260 --> 08:01.894
Roger, stop
this nonsense.

08:01.962 --> 08:02.996
Never!

08:04.966 --> 08:06.600
Not everyone's cut out
to be a cop.

08:06.668 --> 08:07.567
Shut up.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.237
Roger, it's time to quit.

08:10.305 --> 08:11.205
I won't!

08:13.475 --> 08:14.641
You need to give up.

08:14.709 --> 08:15.709
No!

08:21.449 --> 08:23.617
Oh, there's another one.

08:23.684 --> 08:25.151
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

08:25.219 --> 08:27.687
Because I want
to be like you!

08:27.755 --> 08:29.222
What?!
You're the strongest,

08:29.290 --> 08:32.025
bravest,
most honorable guy I know.

08:32.092 --> 08:33.693
If you had been
in that parking lot,

08:33.760 --> 08:35.561
you would have kicked
that mugger's ass.

08:35.629 --> 08:36.861
He humiliated me.

08:36.929 --> 08:38.597
I m tired of bng weak!

08:38.664 --> 08:40.465
Help me!

08:40.533 --> 08:44.235
I've been waiting hear
those words for a long time.

08:44.303 --> 08:46.236
I just prayed they
would come from my son

08:46.304 --> 08:48.438
and not an alien
in a sports bra.

08:48.506 --> 08:51.641
It's a support tank-- it's too
small-- it rode up my belly.

08:51.709 --> 08:54.076
Okay, Roger,
if you're serious,

08:54.144 --> 08:56.345
I'll help you get through
the police academy.

08:56.413 --> 08:57.913
Really?!

08:57.980 --> 08:59.981
Oh, Stan, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

09:02.584 --> 09:04.251
Hello.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.422
I'm gonna go
get some candy.

09:09.490 --> 09:10.856
I have to pee.

09:12.762 --> 09:14.566
Sorry.
Sorry.

09:14.633 --> 09:17.269
MAN
I can't help but think that
we should be together.

09:17.337 --> 09:19.272
WOMAN
I know, but we both have
someone else.

09:19.339 --> 09:21.141
They never have to know.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.308
But we'll know.

09:22.376 --> 09:24.110
I think I can live with that.

09:24.178 --> 09:26.446
I think I can, too.

09:28.149 --> 09:31.050
Yes! Yes!

09:31.117 --> 09:33.385
I'm so glad we're doing this!

09:33.452 --> 09:37.455
Ooh, I took that Zantac
a little too late.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.757
Mmm, mmm-mmm!
Those meatballs
are coming back.

09:41.593 --> 09:44.628
I gotta lie
on my side.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.966
I need napkins.

09:51.034 --> 09:53.735
Okay, Roger, if you want to
make it through the academy,

09:53.802 --> 09:55.236
you have to do
everything I say.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.271
I hope you know what
you're getting into.

09:57.339 --> 09:58.772
I got into these shorts--

09:58.840 --> 10:00.307
I'd say that's already
quite an achievement.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.509

Cadets of the Langley Falls
Police Academy,

11:22.358 --> 11:25.427
I'd like to introduce
your valedictorian, Roger Smith.

11:28.197 --> 11:29.429
Wow.

11:29.496 --> 11:31.228
You know,
when I joined the academy,

11:31.295 --> 11:34.028
I had no idea
what a tough road it would be.

11:34.096 --> 11:36.196
I cried every day
for the first two weeks.

11:36.264 --> 11:37.798
Crapped myself constantly.

Isn't that right, Tito?

11:39.233 --> 11:41.467
What?

Where are you, Tito?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.770
Where do you go?

11:44.838 --> 11:47.372
Anyway, luckily, there was
one man who believed in me.

He is my rock.

Stand up and take a bow, Stan.

11:57.381 --> 11:59.382
Not a bow, but okay.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.187
Here, I want you
to have this.

12:07.254 --> 12:09.054
I couldn't have done
it without you.

12:09.122 --> 12:10.488
No, kiddo, you earned it.

12:10.556 --> 12:11.990
I'm so proud of you.

12:12.057 --> 12:14.291
Hey, I have
a graduation surprise for you.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.658
They caught your mugger.

12:15.726 --> 12:17.560
Let's go.
I'm gonna knock his teeth out.

12:17.627 --> 12:19.061
Roger, you can't.
He's in custody.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.229
We just have to let
the justice system work.

12:21.297 --> 12:22.763
But he humiliated me!

12:22.831 --> 12:25.399
And now I'm strong
and brave enough to strike back!

12:25.466 --> 12:27.533
Roger, just because
you have the tools doesn't mean

12:27.601 --> 12:29.101
you can just do
whatever you want.

12:29.169 --> 12:30.535
You have to respect the law.

12:30.603 --> 12:31.903
Sorry to interrupt.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.404
Detective Chaz
Migliachio.

12:33.471 --> 12:34.771
Great speech
today, Roger.

12:34.839 --> 12:36.006
You got a minute?

12:36.073 --> 12:37.340
I get it.
Police business.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.508
I'll just mingle
with strangers.

12:38.575 --> 12:40.242
Hello, all.

12:40.310 --> 12:43.311
Oh, looks like I'm
the best-looking
one in the group.

12:43.379 --> 12:44.912
Oh, nope.
This guy.

12:44.980 --> 12:46.846
Why don't you find
another group, handsome?

12:46.914 --> 12:48.314
Roger, I've been
watching your progress

12:48.382 --> 12:49.615
the past few months.

12:49.683 --> 12:51.216
I have to say,
I'm impressed.

12:51.284 --> 12:53.251
Well, you should see me
in the shower.

12:54.553 --> 12:55.986
No, I'm just...
Thank you, though.

12:56.054 --> 12:57.254
I overheard you talking

12:57.321 --> 12:59.322
to your buddy about
a mugger in custody.

12:59.389 --> 13:01.556
Yeah. He says we have
to respect the law

13:01.624 --> 13:03.691
and let the legal system
run its course.

13:03.759 --> 13:05.926
Yeah, that's what
most people have to do.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.394
But not everyone.

13:07.462 --> 13:10.330
God, I wish I knew what
you meant when you said that.

13:10.397 --> 13:11.664
Oh, well, see ya.

13:11.732 --> 13:13.032
No, wait! I'll tell you.

13:13.099 --> 13:14.433
Oh, great.
I'm coming back.

13:20.673 --> 13:22.641
Looks like show time.

13:32.518 --> 13:34.385
Roger?! What are you doing?
You're too green.

13:34.452 --> 13:36.587
Get out of there.
You're gonna blow this!

13:36.655 --> 13:38.756
What do we have here,
gentlemen?

13:38.823 --> 13:40.590
Officer, I can explain.

13:40.658 --> 13:42.025
No, I can explain.

13:42.092 --> 13:44.493
I'm taking a cut of everything
that comes through here.

13:44.561 --> 13:46.561
These are my docks now.

13:46.629 --> 13:47.929
Who are you?

13:49.198 --> 13:51.666
He's with me.

13:54.336 --> 13:57.004
I guess when it comes
to hitting people in the head

13:57.072 --> 13:59.272
with a baseball bat,
I'm... "The Natural."

13:59.340 --> 14:01.240
Laugh!

14:01.308 --> 14:03.976
Roger's a dirty cop!

14:04.043 --> 14:06.077
He's been on the force
for three hours!

14:15.000 --> 14:16.401
So, you wanted
to have lunch.

14:16.603 --> 14:18.303
Well, here I am.

14:18.371 --> 14:20.538
Thanks for ordering
me a drink.

14:20.606 --> 14:22.073
That's the cream.

14:22.140 --> 14:24.075
That explains why
it went down creamy.

14:24.142 --> 14:27.177
I saw you shake down those guys
down at the docks.

14:27.245 --> 14:28.845
I know you're a dirty cop.

14:28.913 --> 14:31.848
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:31.916 --> 14:33.850
Roger, this isn't
what I taught you.

14:33.918 --> 14:36.485
I taught you to be strong
and honorable and brave.

14:36.553 --> 14:37.987
Strong!

14:38.054 --> 14:39.855
You don't know
what strong is.

14:39.923 --> 14:42.657
You weren't even brave enough
to pay that mugger a visit.

14:42.725 --> 14:44.125
But Chaz and I were.

14:48.863 --> 14:50.931
Remember me?

14:50.998 --> 14:53.032
Let me tell you a
little about myself.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.067
I grew up in a
pretty unusual house.

14:55.134 --> 14:56.668
It was a...
roundhouse!

14:56.736 --> 14:58.136
We were poor,

14:58.203 --> 15:00.737
so I had to make fruit juice
from a mule.

15:00.805 --> 15:02.538
We called it...
donkey punch!

15:02.606 --> 15:05.774
That was my first taste of
real power, and it felt great.

15:05.841 --> 15:08.941
Then Chaz showed me how I
could feel that way every day--

15:09.008 --> 15:10.708
taking what I
want when I want.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.380
Plus, I'm a sociopath,

15:12.448 --> 15:14.918
so, you know, all this
fits me like a slipper.

15:14.985 --> 15:16.820
Damn it, Roger,
listen to me!

15:16.887 --> 15:19.089
Chaz has got your head
all twisted around.

15:19.157 --> 15:21.591
No! For the first
time in my life,

15:21.659 --> 15:22.992
people aren't
messing with me.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.427
They fear me!

15:24.494 --> 15:27.263
You, put that tub of
mayonnaise in my car.

15:27.331 --> 15:29.932
I'm gonna make it
my girlfriend.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.800
You're a disgrace.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.635
You don't deserve
to wear that mustache.

15:34.838 --> 15:36.771
I was done with it anyway.

15:38.140 --> 15:39.273
Text from Chaz.

15:39.340 --> 15:40.607
I gotta roll.

15:40.675 --> 15:42.409
Tell Klaus
I said "'Sup."

15:45.145 --> 15:46.646
Hey!

16:07.568 --> 16:09.700
What seems
to be the problem, Officer?

16:09.767 --> 16:10.931
Quiet, whole milk!

16:15.636 --> 16:17.904
Noticed that one
of your taillights was busted.

16:17.971 --> 16:20.139
That's a $500 fine.

16:20.207 --> 16:22.108
I'm not allowed
to have money!

16:22.176 --> 16:24.778
Well, then, you're gonna have
to do something for me.

16:24.846 --> 16:27.547
Why don't you go ahead and
scoot back on your banana seat?

16:27.615 --> 16:28.849
What?

16:28.917 --> 16:30.985
Scoot back...
on your seat.

16:32.854 --> 16:34.054
That's good.

16:34.122 --> 16:36.023
Now spit on the
tip of the seat.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.491
But...
Do it!

16:42.063 --> 16:44.030
Now sing with me.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.803
These are my docks now.

17:01.340 --> 17:03.140
Deputy Director Bullock,

17:03.208 --> 17:05.675
I have something
you'll want to see right away.

17:05.742 --> 17:08.310
No, it's not nude photos
of Talia Shire.

17:08.378 --> 17:10.445
No, it's not... Look, no...

17:10.513 --> 17:12.213
I'm-I'm not asking you
to guess what...

17:12.281 --> 17:14.013
No, I didn't buy you a belt.

17:14.082 --> 17:15.516
You'll-You'll see in a minute.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.250
You <i>can</i> wait.
Sir, stop it.

17:29.094 --> 17:30.327
More laundry?

17:30.395 --> 17:32.360
Nah, nah, I finished off
your fabric softener,

17:32.428 --> 17:34.128
so I bought you a new box.

17:35.330 --> 17:36.930
So, how's Rhonda?

17:36.998 --> 17:38.698
I haven't seen you
since our double date.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.202
Actually, me
and her broke up.

17:40.270 --> 17:43.172
Oh, I'm... I'm
sorry to hear that.

17:43.239 --> 17:45.373
You know,
me and Ian broke up, too.

17:45.441 --> 17:47.942
Aw, man, it's Heartbreak Hotel
up in here.

17:48.010 --> 17:49.510
Damn it, Elvis,
leave us alone!

17:49.578 --> 17:51.278
You know what
we need to do?

17:51.346 --> 17:52.479
Race some go-carts.

17:52.547 --> 17:53.614
That sounds like fun.

17:53.681 --> 17:54.848
It's a date then.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.483
All right,
I'm gonna make a sandwich.

17:56.550 --> 17:57.984
If you want one,
holla at your koala.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.188
Hello, Ian?

18:02.255 --> 18:04.523
Listen... I want to break up.

18:05.692 --> 18:07.492
Ooh!

18:09.261 --> 18:11.161
Good work, baby.

18:13.697 --> 18:15.497
The Chaz singer!

18:15.565 --> 18:16.532
What's going on?

18:16.599 --> 18:17.532
We're screwed, Roger!

18:18.667 --> 18:20.568
I got a mole
at the CIA who says

18:20.636 --> 18:22.269
your buddy's been
doing surveillance

18:22.337 --> 18:25.038
down at the docks, which
means he's got tape on us!

18:25.106 --> 18:26.206
What?!

18:27.442 --> 18:28.775
He's been setting us up.

18:28.843 --> 18:30.710
You gotta take him down!

18:34.182 --> 18:36.150
You stop him before he
turns those tapes in!

18:36.217 --> 18:37.618
Yahtzee!

18:37.686 --> 18:40.822
Before we do anything crazy,
let's make sure he has the tape.

18:40.889 --> 18:42.657
Roger, I have the tape.

18:42.724 --> 18:44.458
So I'm gonna give
you a call back.

18:44.526 --> 18:45.759
Love you!

18:45.827 --> 18:47.060
Oh, he already hung up.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.560
He knows, though.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.861
I was standing in Bullock's
office holding that tape,

18:50.929 --> 18:54.064
and at the last minute,
I decided not to give
it to him...

18:54.132 --> 18:56.032
because of this.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.368
You were good man.

18:58.436 --> 19:00.637
And I believe
you still can be.

19:00.705 --> 19:03.072
Sometimes real strength
is having power

19:03.140 --> 19:05.741
and choosing not
to use it.

19:09.912 --> 19:11.613
Chaz, can you take me home?

19:11.680 --> 19:13.280
My tummy doesn't feel so good.

19:13.315 --> 19:15.582
I should have just had sex
with that mayonnaise.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.349
Sure, sure,

19:17.417 --> 19:19.850
but we got one more piece
of business to take care of.

19:22.386 --> 19:24.086
Stan!

19:24.154 --> 19:27.121
Since you know him, I figure
you could do the honors.

19:27.189 --> 19:29.923
But he already gave me the tape.
He didn't turn us in.

19:29.991 --> 19:31.491
I know his type.

19:31.559 --> 19:33.760
Eventually, he's going to want
to do the honorable thing,

19:33.828 --> 19:35.161
then, bam,
we're going to prison.

19:35.229 --> 19:36.863
You know what happens
to you in prison?

19:36.931 --> 19:38.732
I know
Kiefer Sutherland quit smoking.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.400
Do it.

19:40.468 --> 19:43.436
I guess we all knew
it would end up like this.

19:43.504 --> 19:46.771
It didn't have to be this way,
you dumb son of a bitch...

19:46.838 --> 19:48.171
whose name is Chaz!

19:49.707 --> 19:51.073
Oh, boy.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.774
I knew you were weak,
just like your friend here.

19:53.841 --> 19:55.908
Weak?!
This guy's not weak.

19:55.976 --> 19:58.177
He's the strongest man
I know.

19:58.245 --> 19:59.445
He risked
everything for me.

19:59.513 --> 20:00.713
That takes strength.

20:00.781 --> 20:02.014
You see, Chaz,

20:02.082 --> 20:04.550
real strength is having power
and choosing not...

20:04.618 --> 20:07.755
Ow! My skin!

20:07.823 --> 20:09.525
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

20:09.593 --> 20:11.295
Oh, please, no.

20:13.197 --> 20:15.065
Where you going,
princess?

20:15.133 --> 20:16.800
Is that your little
escape route?

20:19.603 --> 20:20.603
What goes up

20:20.670 --> 20:22.404
must come...

20:40.920 --> 20:43.154
That was unexpected.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.063
Good job, Smith.

20:47.130 --> 20:49.064
One less dirty
cop on the docks.

20:49.132 --> 20:51.165
I'm recommending you
for a commendation.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.500
Does that mean more money?

20:52.567 --> 20:53.667
No. Yes.

20:53.735 --> 20:55.001
Maybe. I don't know.

20:55.069 --> 20:57.769
I probably won't
follow through.

21:00.873 --> 21:04.441
You really turned out
to be one tough S.O.B.

21:04.509 --> 21:05.742
Thanks, Stan.

21:05.810 --> 21:07.210
So, have you heard anything?

21:07.278 --> 21:08.544
Is Chaz gonna be okay?

21:08.612 --> 21:09.679
No.

21:09.746 --> 21:11.613
Okay.
