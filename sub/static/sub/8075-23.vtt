WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:07.175
[theme music]

00:07.841 --> 00:09.177
Wow.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.380
I can't believe that today,
our little Darlene is getting

00:12.413 --> 00:15.216
married to our little David.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.350
Yeah.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.719
I can't decide whether
I'm losing a daughter

00:18.752 --> 00:22.756
or gaining a daughter-in-law.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.025
So any word on Nana Mary?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.994
Nobody's seen her since
the rehearsal dinner.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.463
No, but remember the
last time she went AWOL

00:29.497 --> 00:31.365
and we found her down
at the mall diving

00:31.399 --> 00:34.034
in the fountain for change?

00:34.068 --> 00:36.604
Well, it's my last
morning as a single woman.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.605
Not necessarily.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.439
Right, Jackie?

00:44.112 --> 00:45.513
So how are my friends doing?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.048
Oh, they're still all
passed out drunk in there,

00:48.082 --> 00:51.919
but I still poke
them every so often.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.020
That sounds like fun.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.021
Yeah.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.090
The, uh, still
breathing poke is OK,

00:56.124 --> 01:00.060
but the wake-up poke
is going to be great.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.329
Well, I'm going
to go to Becky's

01:01.362 --> 01:02.463
trailer to check on David.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.432
Can I bring you back a possum?

01:04.465 --> 01:05.433
No, no, no.

01:05.466 --> 01:06.900
You are not going anywhere.

01:06.934 --> 01:10.938
It is very bad luck to see
your fiance before the wedding.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.806
Did you see Fred before
your wedding, Jackie?

01:17.010 --> 01:19.580
You're not allowed to see your
fiance before the wedding.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.748
You've got to wear
something old,

01:20.781 --> 01:21.882
and you've got to
wear something--

01:21.915 --> 01:23.351
Mom, that's ridiculous.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.452
Did you do any
of that, Jackie?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.792
I got the tuxes!

01:31.825 --> 01:33.827
Shh!

01:33.861 --> 01:35.396
Don't wake up any
of these people

01:35.429 --> 01:39.833
until every flea in this
room has found a host.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.235
Ow!

01:41.269 --> 01:42.636
Ow!

01:42.670 --> 01:45.573
Hey, it's Nana Mary!

01:45.606 --> 01:47.508
Oh, hi, Rosie!

01:47.541 --> 01:48.542
Hi.

01:48.576 --> 01:53.347
Hey, who the hell's
wearing my pants?

01:53.381 --> 01:56.784
[theme music]

02:54.775 --> 02:56.277
Oops.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.212
Yep.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.447
You got the wrong color tuxes.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.552
Hey.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.186
You guys look great.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.821
I'd take your picture,
but I'm saving

03:07.855 --> 03:10.824
all my film for the cake.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.025
Damn, Rosie.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.228
This wedding's giving me
a nasty case of heartburn.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.596
See?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.198
All those years of eating light
bulbs to entertain the kids

03:18.232 --> 03:20.167
is finally catching up to you.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.836
Hey, um, I want you to
know that later on today,

03:22.870 --> 03:24.805
I'm going to pull Darlene
aside, and I'm going to give

03:24.838 --> 03:26.674
her the mother-daughter talk.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.008
Good for you.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.279
Yeah, but just this
once, I'm not also giving

03:31.312 --> 03:33.914
her the father-daughter talk.

03:33.947 --> 03:34.882
I'm doing my part.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.216
I'm walking her down the aisle.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.251
Come on, Dan.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.320
You've been avoiding
her for six weeks.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.355
You've got to stop acting like
she's pregnant and has to get

03:41.389 --> 03:43.857
married and start acting
like you're six hours away

03:43.891 --> 03:46.594
from all-you-can-eat shrimp.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.995
But Roseanne--

03:48.028 --> 03:49.196
No butts about it.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.131
You are going to get into
the spirit of things,

03:51.164 --> 03:52.866
and you're going to
start by going in there

03:52.900 --> 03:54.402
and helping those
boys get dressed.

03:54.435 --> 03:59.039
And remember, those jackets
do not tuck into those pants.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.443
[music playing]

04:04.011 --> 04:10.851
Another bride, another groom,
another sunny honeymoon!

04:10.884 --> 04:12.152
OK, everybody.

04:12.185 --> 04:16.990
Smile and try to keep those
red dots out of your eyes.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.292
Where's Darlene?

04:18.326 --> 04:20.694
She's still in the bathroom
trying on Grandma's gown.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.662
Come on, now, Darlene.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.064
I can't wait to see
you in my dress.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.333
What do you mean, your dress?

04:25.366 --> 04:26.667
That's my dress.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.936
The first time I
wore that dress,

04:28.969 --> 04:31.539
Roosevelt closed the banks.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.873
That's right!

04:32.906 --> 04:37.578
The first time I wore it, I
had to take it in 10 inches.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.412
Around the boobs.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.950
Zip it.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.185
Darlene, come on out here.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.086
I'm not coming out.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.255
I look ridiculous.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.790
I'm sure you
look fine, Darlene.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.626
It's just the lighting
in that room is bad,

04:52.660 --> 04:55.529
along with the
plumbing and the tiles.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.530
Oh!

04:56.564 --> 04:58.231
Oh, Darlene.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.667
Oh!

04:59.700 --> 05:01.935
I've got six sticks of
dynamite strapped under here.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.272
The first chuckle
takes us all out.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.507
Darlene, you look lovely.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.708
And don't worry.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.544
The-- the little baby in
there doesn't show at all.

05:10.578 --> 05:13.046
You know, all us dames, we--

05:13.080 --> 05:15.282
we all got knocked up
before we got married.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.051
This family-- it's
like tradition.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.454
You look gorgeous, Darlene.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.623
Grandma's gown looks
beautiful on you.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.891
I'm sorry to
say this, Darlene,

05:23.924 --> 05:25.693
but you do look beautiful.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.294
Aren't you happy now
that you've passed

05:27.327 --> 05:30.698
on wearing the flannel
shirt and the bolo tie?

05:30.731 --> 05:32.032
Darlene, I was just
wondering if you'd

05:32.065 --> 05:34.702
reconsidered about little
Andy being the ring bearer.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.504
I know that you think
he's-- he's too young,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.171
but he's been practicing.
Haven't you, sweetheart?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.072
Now look.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.140
Hold the pillow steady.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.041
Right, honey?

05:41.074 --> 05:42.843
And then we take
the Froot Loops,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.211
and we put these on there.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.613
And-- and then we say--

05:45.646 --> 05:48.181
[humming "the wedding march"]

05:50.951 --> 05:52.420
He's eating the rings.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.522
JACKIE: I just-- Honey, I
want you to-- you-- you-- he--

05:54.555 --> 05:56.089
he really wants to do it.

05:56.123 --> 05:59.860
You tell everybody how you feel
about being the ring boy, OK?

05:59.893 --> 06:03.163
You tell everybody what
mommy taught you to say.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.467
Grandma's crazy.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.738
Did-- did-- did he
say grandma is crazy?

06:10.771 --> 06:12.706
He just-- he just needs a nap.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.607
He'll be fine.

06:16.644 --> 06:17.578
Hey!

06:17.611 --> 06:22.115
Who put the now unlucky
veil on the bed?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.217
I mean, I can
counteract the effects,

06:24.251 --> 06:25.819
but I don't know if
I've got enough time

06:25.853 --> 06:27.054
to go get the pigeon blood.

06:32.860 --> 06:33.694
All right.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.929
Last call for the tux shop.

06:35.963 --> 06:40.501
We need black socks
for Mark, size 11.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.403
For DJ, one cuff link.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.905
Rule of thumb for tuxes--

06:44.938 --> 06:47.641
always get a spare one so
you can cut it up for parts.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.642
Mr. Conner?

06:48.676 --> 06:49.477
Don't know how.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.284
So why haven't
you tied your tie?

06:57.317 --> 07:00.253
Mr. Conner doesn't know how.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.088
Give it here.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.966
Listen, Mark, I
know you're probably

07:13.000 --> 07:16.670
sick of hearing about this,
but it just feels weird

07:16.704 --> 07:19.139
that Mom and Dad aren't here.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.073
You still on that?

07:20.107 --> 07:21.842
Well, they're our parents.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.944
I thought maybe for my
wedding day, they might--

07:23.977 --> 07:26.146
Will you just shut
up about them already?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.749
Man, they never did
anything for us.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.018
They kicked me out of
the house when I was 16,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.119
and they treated you like a dog.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.091
The Conners are your
parents now, OK?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.127
You and me both.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.228
They saved our asses.

07:41.261 --> 07:44.064
Well, Mom and Dad
gave us life, OK?

07:44.097 --> 07:47.000
One of us maybe a little more
than the other, but still.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.035
Hey, hey, hey.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.402
It's a slap in the
face to the Conners

07:49.436 --> 07:50.671
for you to be all
hung up on a couple

07:50.704 --> 07:51.805
of jerks who haven't
even bothered

07:51.839 --> 07:52.973
to call in the past four years.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.174
Mark.
Mark?

07:54.207 --> 07:55.075
I don't want to hear it!

07:55.108 --> 07:55.909
Choking!

08:03.383 --> 08:05.519
Where'd you learn to
tie a tie like that?

08:05.553 --> 08:06.353
Dad.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.459
It was the only thing
he ever taught me.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.428
Now I've taught you.

08:15.462 --> 08:18.198
And since it's the only thing he
could have done for you today,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.567
you don't need him anymore.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.071
OK.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.143
Thanks, Mark.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.281
So, uh, what's the matter?

08:34.314 --> 08:36.049
You got butterflies
in your stomach?

08:36.083 --> 08:36.950
No.

08:36.984 --> 08:37.985
A child.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.353
Nauseous, huh?

08:40.387 --> 08:41.488
I hear that, Darlene.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.556
Don't you remember?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.592
Your old aunt was in
a similar situation

08:44.625 --> 08:46.259
before she got married.

08:46.293 --> 08:49.029
Uh, yeah, sort of, except
for that you were nursing

08:49.062 --> 08:51.965
your child at the altar.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.866
Oh, yes.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.467
I remember that wedding.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.738
Thank goodness someone was
offered something to drink.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.106
OK.
Enough yakking.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.007
Come on.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.208
Everybody gather round.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.711
I want one last picture
of all the women

09:03.744 --> 09:05.979
together before
Darlene gets married.

09:06.013 --> 09:09.717
Nana, bring your ass over there.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.651
God, Jackie, come here.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.551
JACKIE: What?

09:11.585 --> 09:12.720
Look in here.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.955
Look in there.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.726
Darlene's getting married.

09:18.759 --> 09:22.062
[music playing]

09:33.941 --> 09:36.076
Well, it's just
like I pictured it

09:36.109 --> 09:38.812
when I objected to it earlier.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.949
Why do they want to have
an outdoor hippie wedding?

09:41.982 --> 09:42.883
Why?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.017
Why?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.887
Oh, because the moon
is in the seventh house?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.191
LEON: Well.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.794
Hey, glad you
could make it, guys.

09:53.827 --> 09:58.398
Oh, I wouldn't miss an event
where Roseanne might cry.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.600
Well, this is just beautiful.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.703
Why didn't we have
our wedding outside?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.536
Snipers.

10:08.375 --> 10:12.780
Hey, Dad, I think
I just saw a skunk.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.747
- Go.
- Hey, DJ!

10:13.781 --> 10:14.581
Wait up!

10:17.417 --> 10:18.285
Wow.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.920
This is so cool.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.154
I've never been to
an outdoor wedding

10:21.188 --> 10:22.956
where everyone was
wearing clothes.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.824
Yeah.

10:23.857 --> 10:27.060
The '90s sure are nuts.

10:27.094 --> 10:30.230
Aw, look, Nana Mary.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.131
Hello, Dan.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.165
This is Nancy.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.968
Nancy, this is
Roseanne's grandmother.

10:35.002 --> 10:38.438
Oh, I'm sure you too must
have scads to talk about.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.776
Why don't you start with aliens?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.545
It's so weird that
you said that because I

10:45.578 --> 10:48.716
was abducted by aliens in
woods just let these one time.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.683
Really?

10:49.717 --> 10:51.251
For a month
afterwards, I could play

10:51.284 --> 10:53.620
world champion caliber chess.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.790
And then it just went away.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.625
You know, if I'd known--

10:58.658 --> 11:00.027
if I'd known we
were going to sit

11:00.060 --> 11:02.395
on these hard, wooden benches, I
would not have worn this thong.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.535
Let's see.

11:08.568 --> 11:12.806
Just enough flowers to
look beautiful, but not

11:12.840 --> 11:16.844
enough to attract the bees.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.746
Yeah.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.513
Uh, you know, I
wanted to ask you,

11:20.547 --> 11:22.449
do you think Dad's gonna
walk me down the aisle?

11:22.482 --> 11:25.685
Or you think he's just
gonna give me a big push?

11:25.719 --> 11:29.622
Oh, now, you know he
loves you, right, Darlene?

11:29.656 --> 11:31.124
Yeah.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.525
OK.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.562
Well, just try to remember that
when he gives you the big push.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.966
Thank God I'm marrying someone
relatively sane like David.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.067
No, no, no, Darlene.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.235
All husbands are kind of insane.

11:42.269 --> 11:45.638
You know, after you marry, uh,
David and everything, there's

11:45.672 --> 11:47.340
gonna be times where you'll
be sitting there going,

11:47.374 --> 11:50.343
what the hell did I
marry this guy for?

11:50.377 --> 11:54.547
And then, like, it'll snow and
he'll put chains on your tires,

11:54.581 --> 11:56.850
and then you'll remember.

11:56.884 --> 11:57.951
Nah.

11:57.985 --> 12:01.454
David's not allowed
anywhere near my car.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.357
Already talking
like a married woman.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.258
God.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.360
Soon I'll be talking like a mom.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.763
Just sitting around the
girls eating salads,

12:09.797 --> 12:12.199
chatting about sore nipples
and waiting for the Prozac

12:12.232 --> 12:14.868
to kick in.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.905
You remind me of me so much
when I was your age, you know?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.773
Ready to go out and grab
the world by the throat

12:19.807 --> 12:22.142
and throttle it into control.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.343
It's really good
that you've got all

12:23.376 --> 12:25.512
the energy you've got,
Darlene, because you're

12:25.545 --> 12:27.781
going to need it.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.416
Do you think I
can handle it all?

12:29.449 --> 12:30.650
Oh, I think you're
going to be great.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.456
And you know, if you
have anything going on

12:36.489 --> 12:38.691
that you need help with,
even that baby, you

12:38.725 --> 12:41.694
can bring that to us anytime.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.997
Well, I can bring
it to you, anyway.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.565
Oh, your dad's
going to come around.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.135
It's just, um,
after our wedding,

12:48.168 --> 12:50.437
he hardly saw his
parents again, you know?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.239
So I think maybe this
wedding-- maybe it's bringing

12:52.272 --> 12:54.207
all that stuff back up for him.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.142
Well, fine.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.309
And if he ever
talks to me again,

12:56.343 --> 12:58.245
I'll just let him know
I'm going to be around.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.746
I mean, I'm gonna
need someplace to hang

12:59.779 --> 13:02.249
out while David's watching the
baby and cleaning the house.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.384
[chuckling]

13:04.417 --> 13:06.653
You go, girl.

13:06.686 --> 13:09.823
No, I heard that
on, uh, Ricky Lake.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.425
Yeah, I saw it, so
don't even go there.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.794
[chuckling]

13:14.828 --> 13:16.263
I just want to thank
you because you've

13:16.296 --> 13:21.301
been really great during this
whole wedding thing, so thanks.

13:21.334 --> 13:22.669
You know, I know how
you could have been.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.172
Yeah, I could have
made you guys miserable.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.776
Remember how you
were the first time

13:29.809 --> 13:31.011
David spent the night?

13:31.044 --> 13:32.645
Oh, yeah, it was awesome.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.315
I was a total bitch.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.650
That'll happen again, you know.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.452
I know.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.355
So you ready?

13:42.389 --> 13:43.556
[sigh]

13:43.590 --> 13:48.295
Well, in the words of
Gary Gilmore, let's do it.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.698
[music playing]

13:55.268 --> 13:57.337
ROSEANNE: Well, Darlene's ready.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.538
No!

13:58.571 --> 13:59.606
I knew it!

13:59.639 --> 14:01.308
The little midget's
freaking out on us.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.809
No, he's not.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.810
He is not freaking out.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.914
He-- he-- he loves his mommy.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.215
Bull!

14:08.248 --> 14:10.050
DJ, you are going to
have to be the ring boy.

14:10.083 --> 14:10.951
No way!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.352
I'm gonna look totally stupid!

14:12.385 --> 14:13.786
I mean, I'll be humiliated.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.854
Mark, it's up to you.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.090
I'm your man.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.425
No!
No!

14:18.458 --> 14:20.560
Now, we promised little Andy
that he would be the ring boy,

14:20.593 --> 14:21.694
so I'm--
I'm sorry.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.695
I'll just-- please.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.364
Ring boy coming through.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.968
Ring boy coming through.

14:28.001 --> 14:28.868
All right.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.104
Well, you're next.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.173
Uh, you know, your
daughter would like

14:33.206 --> 14:34.141
to hear something from you.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.342
Can't you just go
tell her you're

14:35.375 --> 14:36.944
happy for her or something?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.514
Why are they not standing up?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.815
Oh, the guy at
rehearsal said they

14:42.849 --> 14:44.151
only stand up for the bride.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.153
Well, I really don't care
what the guy at rehearsal said.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.254
The hell with tradition.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.155
Everybody up!

14:48.188 --> 14:49.089
I want you standing up!

14:56.863 --> 14:59.699
Wow.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.435
Scary, huh?

15:02.469 --> 15:04.471
You look different.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.073
Well, mission accomplished.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.082
Oh, no.

15:15.115 --> 15:15.915
Oh, God.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.022
- She got sick.
- What'd you say to her?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.026
What's the matter?
She's pregnant.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.227
She had to barf.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.495
Ain't none of yous ever
been to a wedding before?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.000
- I'll go get her.
- No.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.367
I had one job.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.603
That was to walk my daughter
down the aisle, and I'll do it.

15:42.409 --> 15:45.045
Well, picked a good spot.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.046
Thanks.

15:46.079 --> 15:47.447
You should always
find a down slope

15:47.480 --> 15:50.017
according to "Modern Bride."

15:50.050 --> 15:51.884
You OK?

15:51.918 --> 15:54.187
Yeah.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.888
Well, I guess we
better get back.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.490
Wait up.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.691
Darlene, there's
something I've been

15:58.725 --> 16:00.027
wanting to talk to you about.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.594
Well, it's a good
thing I had to puke,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.064
or you'd have
missed your chance.

16:04.097 --> 16:08.568
See, uh, I was thinking--

16:08.601 --> 16:11.471
man, how do I do this?

16:11.504 --> 16:12.605
Are you all right?

16:12.639 --> 16:13.473
Yeah, I'm OK.

16:13.506 --> 16:17.477
It's just, um, well, here.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.548
What's this?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.283
That's a key to a
savings deposit box.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.851
Nobody knows about it.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.986
There's a bunch of
savings bonds in there

16:27.020 --> 16:29.722
and a coin collection that
my grandfather gave to me.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.792
It's your just-in-case
money, Darlene.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.627
Dad, you're going to
need this more than we are.

16:34.661 --> 16:35.962
No, honey, now you
got a baby coming--

16:35.995 --> 16:36.396
Yeah, but you have a
baby at home right now.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.430
I mean--

16:37.464 --> 16:38.731
--And I just think,
you know-- honey,

16:38.765 --> 16:40.967
you're just gonna take it
because I just think if you

16:41.000 --> 16:43.303
had more money laying
around, you'd have

16:43.336 --> 16:44.604
more chances to change--

16:48.241 --> 16:51.244
I don't know, whatever
it is you want to change.

16:54.247 --> 16:58.485
I just don't want you to miss
any opportunities, Darlene.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.520
I'm not going to
miss any opportunities.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.988
David and I are
still young enough so

17:02.021 --> 17:03.923
that we have plenty of time
to do whatever it is that we--

17:03.956 --> 17:05.492
DAN: No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:05.525 --> 17:08.761
You see, that's where
you're wrong, Darlene.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.530
Everybody thinks
there's plenty of time

17:10.563 --> 17:13.466
to do whatever they want.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.567
Believe me, there's not.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.906
Stuff happens.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.808
What stuff?

17:21.841 --> 17:23.243
Oh, I don't know.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.211
Any kind of stuff.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.913
All kinds of stuff.

17:26.946 --> 17:31.351
So you plan things, and
the clock keeps ticking,

17:31.384 --> 17:34.053
and you never do them.

17:34.087 --> 17:38.225
And suddenly, DJ's
in high school

17:38.258 --> 17:39.192
and you're having a baby.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.265
I haven't talked to
my dad in two years.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.571
[crying]

17:56.543 --> 18:00.547
You look beautiful.
What's the occasion?

18:03.450 --> 18:06.886
Dad, I-- I'm not
going anywhere, OK?

18:06.919 --> 18:07.720
I'm going to be around.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.891
You know, the first
time I held you,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.527
you were wearing white
and you threw up.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.433
I've been behaving
like a total jerk,

18:20.467 --> 18:23.002
and I should have
been supporting you.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.405
Are you OK?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.107
Can I do anything for you?

18:28.141 --> 18:29.576
You could walk
me down the aisle.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.348
You ready to give me away?

18:35.382 --> 18:38.451
No, I'm not.

18:38.485 --> 18:41.821
[music playing]

18:45.358 --> 18:49.196
At this time,
Darlene and David

18:49.229 --> 18:51.564
have elected to share
with each other vows

18:51.598 --> 18:52.832
that they've written themselves.

18:55.835 --> 19:00.973
I, David, promise to always
love and respect you, Darlene,

19:01.007 --> 19:05.178
my fellow traveler on this
planet, as we tread lightly

19:05.212 --> 19:09.148
and replenish what we have
taken from this earth.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.484
I guess we'll have to return
the deer rifle we got him.

19:14.086 --> 19:14.954
Did you hear that?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.223
Did you hear what I just said?

19:16.256 --> 19:17.123
Funny.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.659
Yeah, deer rifle.

19:19.692 --> 19:24.163
And I, Darlene, promise to
love and respect you, David,

19:24.197 --> 19:26.599
as we strive not for
material possessions,

19:26.633 --> 19:29.736
but for contentment
and peace of mind.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.037
I think she's
got marriage mixed

19:31.070 --> 19:32.305
up with a nap on the porch.

19:35.942 --> 19:36.876
How come you're not laughing.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.010
Did you hear that?

19:38.044 --> 19:38.845
Deer rifle.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.251
And we know the
best way that we

19:44.284 --> 19:47.854
can make it is to
rely on each other

19:47.887 --> 19:51.291
the way our parents, Dan
and Roseanne Conner, have.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.160
No matter how good or
bad life has been to them,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.928
they always found
the humor in it,

19:55.962 --> 19:59.065
and we hope we can do the same.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.500
I didn't see that coming.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.768
Did you hear that?

20:01.801 --> 20:04.971
Yeah, I heard that.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.706
Congratulations.

20:06.739 --> 20:10.543
You are now married.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.779
I can't believe you bought
that whole pregnancy thing.

20:15.848 --> 20:19.185
[applause]

20:21.254 --> 20:24.090
[music playing]

20:31.564 --> 20:34.934
[gasping]

20:36.035 --> 20:37.737
You ought to see Nana Mary.

20:37.770 --> 20:41.841
She thinks the ice sculpture
is a mechanical bull.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.742
No thanks.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.976
I don't feel so good.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.044
Well, duh.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.779
You were pounding down
the imitation crab

20:46.813 --> 20:49.716
like it was the real thing.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.151
Good work, honey.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.253
You know what I think?

20:54.287 --> 20:57.757
I think we ought to get
divorced just so we can

20:57.790 --> 20:59.359
get remarried again, you know?

20:59.392 --> 21:01.093
And then we can
write our own vows,

21:01.127 --> 21:05.565
and we'll say that we
want to be just like us.

21:05.598 --> 21:09.302
Uh, I really
don't feel so good.

21:09.336 --> 21:10.903
I'm not kidding.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.341
Maybe you should go find a
phone and call Dr. Walker.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.008
Dan--

21:16.042 --> 21:16.843
Call somebody.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.248
[glass falling]

21:26.252 --> 21:28.254
[ambulance siren]

21:35.261 --> 21:37.263
[door shutting]

21:43.069 --> 21:46.305
[stretcher rolling]
