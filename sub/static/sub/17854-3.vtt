00:00.001 --> 00:01.312
<i>Previously on "Incorporated"...</i>

00:01.314 --> 00:03.275
Take this.

00:03.277 --> 00:05.168
- Bye, Aaron.
- I'll find you.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.844
<i>My sister, she's a sex slave.</i>

00:06.846 --> 00:07.779
- Where is she? <i>
- Arcadia.</i>

00:07.781 --> 00:08.436
<i>Can you get in here?</i>

00:08.438 --> 00:10.103
<i>Access is restricted
to senior execs.</i>

00:10.105 --> 00:11.537
- <i>What was that?</i>
- Tell me you got a plan.

00:11.539 --> 00:13.462
<i>Position's about to
open up on the 40th.</i>

00:14.761 --> 00:16.286
<i>Chad got fired today.</i>

00:16.288 --> 00:18.226
Then we revoke his security clearance,

00:18.228 --> 00:20.131
execute his nondisclosure agreement.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.099
No one gets to senior management

00:22.101 --> 00:23.618
<i>without the company
learning everything.</i>

00:23.620 --> 00:24.708
<i>We got the permit.</i>

00:24.710 --> 00:26.305
- We're gonna get pregnant. <i>
- Micronesian nationalists</i>

00:26.307 --> 00:27.549
<i>killed a dozen of our guys today.</i>

00:27.551 --> 00:28.866
Word is, it was Inazagi agents.

00:28.868 --> 00:30.279
<i>Inazagi? You think they'd dare to?</i>

00:30.281 --> 00:31.879
<i>I mean, we both want
that promotion, right?</i>

00:31.881 --> 00:33.911
<i>I may have underestimated
you, Ben Larson.</i>

00:33.913 --> 00:35.946
<i>Sometimes I even surprise myself.</i>

00:46.689 --> 00:48.925
Oh, no.

00:50.266 --> 00:51.883
What's wrong, Jaimie?

00:51.885 --> 00:56.024
I think my mom might've said
a bad thing, Officer Bucky.

00:56.026 --> 00:57.420
Like a bad word?

00:57.422 --> 01:00.702
No. Much worse than a bad word.

01:00.704 --> 01:04.668
Uh, but I don't know if
I should tell anybody.

01:04.670 --> 01:06.550
Was it about the company, Jaimie?

01:06.552 --> 01:07.671
Mm-hmm.

01:07.673 --> 01:10.348
I don't want to get my mom in trouble.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.846
<i>Of course you don't.</i>

01:11.848 --> 01:13.814
<i>You love your mom, don't you?</i>

01:13.816 --> 01:16.584
<i>But you also love your
dad and your sister</i>

01:16.586 --> 01:17.862
<i>and your friends.</i>

01:17.864 --> 01:20.761
<i>And you love me, too,
don't you, Jaimie?</i>

01:20.763 --> 01:22.186
<i>Well, sure.</i>

01:22.188 --> 01:23.356
<i>You see, Jaimie,</i>

01:23.358 --> 01:25.701
<i>the company is made up
of all kinds of parts.</i>

01:25.703 --> 01:27.504
<i>Just like your machine here.</i>

01:27.506 --> 01:29.739
<i>All the parts need to work together.</i>

01:29.741 --> 01:33.332
<i>And if one is broken
or defective or weak...</i>

01:34.769 --> 01:36.289
<i>We wouldn't want anything like that</i>

01:36.291 --> 01:38.661
<i>to happen to the company, would we?</i>

01:38.663 --> 01:42.942
<i>I think I'm ready to tell
you what my mom said.</i>

01:45.041 --> 01:46.412
<i>Good job, Jaimie.</i>

01:46.414 --> 01:47.849
<i>You did the right thing...</i>

01:47.851 --> 01:50.777
<i>for your family and for the company.</i>

01:50.779 --> 01:53.351
<i>Now you're a real company deputy.</i>

01:53.353 --> 01:54.612
<i>Just like me!</i>

01:54.614 --> 01:57.555
<i>Thanks, Officer Bucky!</i>

01:57.557 --> 01:59.884
<i>both: If you hear something yucky,</i>

01:59.886 --> 02:01.245
<i>tell Officer Bucky.</i>

02:01.247 --> 02:04.328
If you hear something yucky,

02:04.330 --> 02:06.363
tell Officer Bucky.

02:06.365 --> 02:09.133
If you hear something yucky,

02:09.134 --> 02:11.335
tell Officer Bucky.

02:11.337 --> 02:14.171
If you hear something yucky,

02:14.173 --> 02:16.273
tell Officer Bucky.

02:16.275 --> 02:19.209
If you hear something yucky,

02:19.211 --> 02:21.511
tell Officer Bucky.

02:27.966 --> 02:30.520
What about Thursday afternoon?

02:30.522 --> 02:34.824
Uh, we have Everclear test trials all day.

02:34.826 --> 02:38.694
Um, I could also do Friday lunch time.

02:41.498 --> 02:43.632
I'll be working on the
presentation of the results.

02:43.634 --> 02:47.536
I'll probably have to eat at my desk.

02:47.538 --> 02:50.033
You know, they're just
gonna remove the IUD.

02:50.035 --> 02:51.974
You don't need to be there for that.

02:54.344 --> 02:55.710
I told you,

02:55.712 --> 02:58.646
I want to be there every step of the way.

02:58.648 --> 03:00.882
It's just this promotion.

03:00.884 --> 03:03.517
You know, they need to
see I really want it.

03:03.519 --> 03:05.365
You don't have to want it.

03:05.367 --> 03:06.888
You know that, right?

03:06.890 --> 03:09.057
Think we're doing pretty
well for ourselves.

03:14.830 --> 03:18.431
Who is this adorable little munchkin?

03:18.433 --> 03:19.800
Hi, my name is Hazel.

03:19.802 --> 03:21.534
I'm a Spiga Scout Leader,

03:21.536 --> 03:23.170
and I have a question for you today.

03:23.172 --> 03:24.637
Do you like chocolate?

03:24.639 --> 03:26.239
Well, yes, I do.

03:26.241 --> 03:28.141
I have great news for you then, ma'am.

03:28.143 --> 03:30.176
This week, we have
a two-for-one special

03:30.178 --> 03:31.677
on our best-selling cookies.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.379
The Triple Chocolate Fudge Bomb.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.749
Name trademarked.

03:36.751 --> 03:38.784
That is quite a sales pitch, young lady.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.754
Please come in and show me your selection.

03:41.756 --> 03:44.924
We take e-payment in
any major currencies...

03:44.926 --> 03:48.159
- dollars, yuans, blackcoin.
- Great. Come on in here.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.196
So this is life on the 35th floor, huh?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.463
You got a pool back there?

03:52.465 --> 03:54.065
That's 40th and up and you know it.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.367
Yeah, sure, even water's a perk these days.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.770
- Hmm.
- Show me the cookies.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.205
What are you doing here?

04:02.275 --> 04:06.910
You asked me to keep track of
the five new girls in Arcadia.

04:06.912 --> 04:10.781
Well, last night, I got an I-92.

04:10.783 --> 04:13.617
- Let's make it fun.
- Okay...

04:13.619 --> 04:17.954
- That's a...
- Termination of contract form.

04:17.957 --> 04:20.255
One of them tried to
escape, stole a weapon,

04:20.257 --> 04:23.092
she got shot by a guard.

04:23.094 --> 04:24.293
Was it Elena?

04:24.295 --> 04:27.764
We don't get names in
H.R., just their codes.

04:27.766 --> 04:30.466
You'll have to use your keyhole
to find out for yourself.

04:30.468 --> 04:32.735
I can't, I lost it.

04:32.737 --> 04:34.470
- You lost it?
- Someone took it.

04:34.472 --> 04:35.571
Shit.

04:35.573 --> 04:36.772
Can they trace it back to you?

04:36.774 --> 04:39.107
No, it has a self-destruct protocol.

04:39.109 --> 04:40.742
If someone tried to access
it, it'll burn itself out.

04:40.744 --> 04:44.345
Protocols can be overwritten.

04:44.347 --> 04:47.348
Do yourself a favor, will you?

04:47.350 --> 04:49.818
Forget about Elena.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.688
Have some kids, sell some cookies.

04:53.690 --> 04:55.656
Now tell me, what are these badges?

04:55.658 --> 04:56.957
Well...

04:56.959 --> 04:59.260
this one is my dream-catcher badge.

04:59.262 --> 05:00.227
Oh, my gosh.

05:00.229 --> 05:03.563
I can't.

05:03.565 --> 05:05.399
If she's alive, I need to find out.

05:05.401 --> 05:06.733
There's no way.

05:06.735 --> 05:08.803
Not unless you could
get a look at the body,

05:08.805 --> 05:10.904
and we both know that's impossible.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.739
Honey, time to go.

05:13.741 --> 05:16.642
_

05:26.387 --> 05:27.853
Watch it!

05:39.666 --> 05:41.700
What can I get ya?

05:43.904 --> 05:45.069
Water.

05:53.579 --> 05:55.512
$5.92.

05:55.514 --> 05:57.781
Anything else?

05:57.783 --> 05:59.817
Some ice, maybe?

05:59.819 --> 06:02.819
- Try the Four Seasons.
- Okay, what about your contact?

06:02.821 --> 06:04.387
Nice segue.

06:04.389 --> 06:05.755
Real smooth.

06:05.757 --> 06:07.657
Does it ever work?

06:07.659 --> 06:11.228
Well, different girls,
different approaches.

06:11.230 --> 06:13.830
You strike me as the type who
doesn't have time for bullshit.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.899
- You're direct.
- Really?

06:15.901 --> 06:18.601
What else do you see in your crystal ball?

06:18.603 --> 06:20.702
You work hard.

06:20.704 --> 06:23.472
You're tough as nails.

06:23.474 --> 06:25.007
And your father would cut my balls off

06:25.009 --> 06:27.009
if he saw me talking to his little girl.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.911
Mm, I'm sure he wouldn't
be the first to try.

06:28.913 --> 06:30.946
- See, you know me, too.
- I don't.

06:30.948 --> 06:32.314
And you don't know me, either.

06:32.316 --> 06:34.016
Oh, but I do.

06:41.024 --> 06:42.556
Aaron?

06:42.558 --> 06:44.392
Told you I'd find you.

06:44.394 --> 06:46.261
Oh!

06:49.900 --> 06:52.533
I can't believe it!

06:52.535 --> 06:54.368
I told you to sell this.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.735
I had to.

06:55.737 --> 06:58.205
A couple times, actually, but...

06:58.207 --> 07:00.173
I always made sure to get it back.

07:01.777 --> 07:03.911
<i>- Last night?
- Yeah.</i>

07:03.913 --> 07:06.280
Dumb skint made a run for it.

07:06.282 --> 07:07.948
I mean, you'd think they'd be grateful.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.549
They get to eat better than we do.

07:09.551 --> 07:12.285
I don't know, I've heard
she was servicing Holmes.

07:12.287 --> 07:14.253
The way the guy runs the
Hydroponics Department,

07:14.255 --> 07:15.788
I'm sure he likes to make them bleed.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.623
Oh!

07:28.535 --> 07:31.669
_

07:31.671 --> 07:33.504
Run diagnostics.

07:36.509 --> 07:38.043
_

07:38.045 --> 07:40.812
What the... abort diagnostics.

07:40.814 --> 07:42.780
Disengage device.

07:42.782 --> 07:44.548
Shut power down now!

07:52.900 --> 07:56.135
The Inazagi delegation's on its way, sir.

07:56.137 --> 07:58.037
ETA, 1100 hours.

07:58.039 --> 07:59.204
Good.

07:59.206 --> 08:00.772
It's time to bring these negotiations

08:00.774 --> 08:02.273
to a close, Elizabeth.

08:02.275 --> 08:05.276
I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

08:05.278 --> 08:06.877
Close the deal.

08:06.879 --> 08:08.846
But don't settle, get
the agricultural rights

08:08.848 --> 08:10.448
north of the Loire.

08:10.450 --> 08:13.818
Inazagi can keep the rest,
all the way down to Gibraltar,

08:13.820 --> 08:15.019
for all we care.

08:15.021 --> 08:17.388
That won't be a problem.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.423
One last thing.

08:19.425 --> 08:21.624
Fellow members of the
board have been questioning

08:21.626 --> 08:23.560
your ability to handle these talks.

08:23.562 --> 08:25.562
Especially under your own roof.

08:25.564 --> 08:28.198
If this is because of the
Peterson security breach,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.734
I guarantee his file has
been permanently closed.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.438
Is that so, Julian?

08:36.941 --> 08:39.541
Absolutely, sir.

08:39.543 --> 08:42.010
Mr. Peterson was acting alone.

08:42.013 --> 08:43.412
The file's closed.

08:45.649 --> 08:47.049
For your own sake, Elizabeth,

08:47.051 --> 08:48.684
keep your house in order.

08:48.686 --> 08:50.353
And remember:

08:50.355 --> 08:52.820
the markets are watching closely.

08:59.829 --> 09:00.996
Elizabeth.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.199
It's been a long time, EVP Mason.

09:08.472 --> 09:11.271
It's a pleasure to meet you, SVP Walters.

09:11.273 --> 09:13.240
I hope we can wrap this up today.

09:13.242 --> 09:16.176
The pleasure's mine, Ms. Krauss.

09:16.178 --> 09:19.346
But I'm afraid we have
miles to go before we sleep.

09:23.219 --> 09:25.944
<i>Diana Walters, 43 years old.</i>

09:25.946 --> 09:29.347
Senior Vice President of Global Resources.

09:29.349 --> 09:32.917
Recruited by Inazagi in
'54, right out of college.

09:32.919 --> 09:34.352
Married, no children.

09:36.322 --> 09:41.025
I have miles to go before I sleep.

09:41.027 --> 09:42.626
We have a defector on our hands.

09:42.628 --> 09:44.127
We can't be sure.

09:44.129 --> 09:47.564
What, you think she's a Robert Frost fan?

09:47.566 --> 09:49.899
Come on, Julian.

09:49.901 --> 09:52.602
We've both heard that quote before.

09:52.604 --> 09:54.304
An executive at her level?

09:54.306 --> 09:56.739
I want to hear what she has to offer.

09:56.741 --> 09:59.176
Even if you're right,

09:59.178 --> 10:01.810
even if she's asking for a job interview,

10:01.812 --> 10:05.747
a defection takes time,
planning, groundwork.

10:05.749 --> 10:10.252
We mess it up, the diplomatic
shitstorm will be unprecedented.

10:10.254 --> 10:12.054
That's why I had the counterintelligence

10:12.056 --> 10:14.156
tech division sent in.

10:14.158 --> 10:16.792
You want Peterson's position?
Show me what you got.

10:16.794 --> 10:18.159
If you need a private space to talk,

10:18.161 --> 10:21.296
we can set up a velvet curtain in no time.

10:21.298 --> 10:22.897
And then what?

10:22.899 --> 10:24.332
How are we supposed to extract her

10:24.334 --> 10:28.103
in front of the entire Inazagi delegation?

10:28.105 --> 10:30.805
I heard there's a dead girl in Arcadia.

10:33.810 --> 10:37.244
If it's true, we could use
her body to make a switch.

10:38.780 --> 10:42.182
Even if it were true, how
would you know about it?

10:42.184 --> 10:44.718
Rumors spread quickly.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.720
There aren't supposed to be any.

10:46.722 --> 10:50.690
Well, that's your department's
job, right, Julian?

10:50.692 --> 10:55.060
So, Ben... what's the plan?

10:55.062 --> 10:57.963
Well, Inazagi needs to take a body home.

10:57.965 --> 11:00.399
It doesn't need to be alive, though.

11:00.401 --> 11:02.668
And they just need to
believe it's Diana Walters.

11:16.365 --> 11:18.332
<i>No, no, no!</i>

11:18.334 --> 11:19.832
Let go!

11:19.834 --> 11:20.633
Stop.

11:20.635 --> 11:22.301
Ah!

11:22.303 --> 11:23.602
Stop! Pull over!

11:23.604 --> 11:27.040
Please! Ow! No, please!

11:27.042 --> 11:28.374
Hey!

11:28.376 --> 11:30.043
Hey! What's going on here?

11:30.045 --> 11:31.511
This woman works for you, ma'am?

11:31.513 --> 11:32.878
She does. Why?

11:32.880 --> 11:35.005
- I'm very sorry, Miss...
- Larson.

11:35.007 --> 11:37.735
But I'm afraid we've caught
her leaving with stolen goods.

11:37.737 --> 11:39.039
Stolen goods?

11:39.041 --> 11:42.645
You recognize this?

11:42.647 --> 11:44.347
It's real bacon.

11:44.349 --> 11:46.416
I'd say $600 worth.

11:47.719 --> 11:51.354
Yes, that's mine.

11:51.356 --> 11:54.723
It's was a... present for her.

11:54.725 --> 11:56.292
A present?

11:56.294 --> 11:59.495
Yes. For her years of service.

11:59.497 --> 12:01.197
She's been quite good to us.

12:01.199 --> 12:02.998
It's a very expensive present, ma'am.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.975
You have to provide your maid
with a signed authorization

12:04.977 --> 12:06.412
for things like this.

12:06.414 --> 12:10.006
I-I really don't have the time for this.

12:10.008 --> 12:11.806
You know what?

12:11.808 --> 12:14.201
Why don't you keep it?

12:14.203 --> 12:17.479
So you know we appreciate
your service, too.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.186
Much appreciated, ma'am.

12:25.188 --> 12:26.444
Have a good day.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.423
You too.

12:31.670 --> 12:35.679
If you swipe to page
23 of the attached memo,

12:35.681 --> 12:38.148
you'll see that our offer
is more than generous.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.984
After all, the arable
land south of the Pyrenees

12:40.986 --> 12:43.253
is showing high levels of soil erosion,

12:43.255 --> 12:47.290
making it a less desirable
site for class one high-yield

12:47.292 --> 12:50.526
corporate acquisition and cultivation.

12:50.528 --> 12:52.395
As we'll demonstrate, independent studies

12:52.397 --> 12:55.965
from the Human Toxicity Bureau
indicate the remaining soil...

12:59.637 --> 13:01.869
- Clear.
- Yeah.

13:18.954 --> 13:22.523
"I have miles to go before I sleep."

13:22.525 --> 13:25.192
Glad you recognized my message.

13:25.194 --> 13:26.693
Let's skip the pleasantries.

13:26.695 --> 13:29.530
We have about two minutes
before they check in on you.

13:29.532 --> 13:31.365
Direct. Works for me.

13:31.367 --> 13:33.367
I want the basic extraction package...

13:33.369 --> 13:34.701
new name, face, fingerprints,

13:34.703 --> 13:37.137
and relocation to one
of your foreign offices.

13:37.139 --> 13:40.406
I'm partial to sandy
beaches and nice weather.

13:40.408 --> 13:41.541
Anchorage, perhaps.

13:41.543 --> 13:43.243
Let's say that can be arranged.

13:43.245 --> 13:44.669
Why should I give it to you?

13:44.671 --> 13:48.506
My company's developing
a new line of seeds.

13:48.508 --> 13:50.408
A design that'll wipe Spiga off the map.

13:50.410 --> 13:52.909
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to give me more than that.

13:52.911 --> 13:54.944
Why do you think we're so ready to settle

13:54.946 --> 13:57.214
for a worthless piece of land like Spain

13:57.216 --> 13:59.316
or the south of France?

13:59.318 --> 14:04.188
Because very soon, we'll be
able to grow crops in the desert.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.325
If your people really can do that,

14:08.327 --> 14:10.125
why join the losing side?

14:16.634 --> 14:18.067
You're pregnant.

14:18.069 --> 14:20.135
And I don't want my child to grow into

14:20.137 --> 14:21.870
a mindless Inazagi drone.

14:21.872 --> 14:23.739
<i>So the rumors of the
indoctrination programs</i>

14:23.741 --> 14:25.974
<i>- are true.
- You have no idea.</i>

14:27.311 --> 14:29.977
<i>Ma'am, it's time.</i>

14:29.979 --> 14:32.146
All right, you got yourself a deal.

14:32.148 --> 14:33.582
Not so easy.

14:33.584 --> 14:35.550
The Kusari is a
next-generation tech virus.

14:35.552 --> 14:39.153
<i>Not only does it monitor my
position and my hormone levels,</i>

14:39.155 --> 14:41.889
<i>it'll terminate me
if I try to escape.</i>

14:41.891 --> 14:44.791
Shit, there's a kill switch in her blood.

14:44.793 --> 14:47.394
Only EVP Mason can disarm it.

14:49.098 --> 14:50.097
<i>Ma'am?</i>

14:50.099 --> 14:51.699
I'm coming in.

14:51.701 --> 14:55.035
Oh! Jesus, you startled me.

14:59.842 --> 15:02.575
All right, you heard the lady.

15:02.577 --> 15:04.644
Do we have any quick thinkers in the room?

15:04.646 --> 15:05.978
Now is your moment to shine.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.480
The kill switch and its trigger,

15:07.482 --> 15:09.115
they're connected wirelessly.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.651
If we find the frequency, we can
hack the Kusari and disarm it.

15:11.653 --> 15:12.985
Too dangerous.

15:12.987 --> 15:14.721
We don't know what kind of firewall it has.

15:14.723 --> 15:16.956
It could kill her as soon
as we try to break in.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.590
Share your wisdom with us, then.

15:18.592 --> 15:21.593
How do you propose we disarm it?

15:21.595 --> 15:23.762
We don't.

15:23.764 --> 15:26.598
We get Inazagi to do it for us.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.099
That's quite clever.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.101
And risky, to say the least.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.903
Mm.

15:31.905 --> 15:35.539
It could trigger an
all-out war with Inazagi.

15:35.541 --> 15:38.442
And you'd most certainly lose your job.

15:38.444 --> 15:41.879
If they're really on the
verge of such a breakthrough,

15:41.881 --> 15:45.115
there won't be a job for me to lose.

15:45.117 --> 15:47.818
Or you.

15:47.820 --> 15:50.421
Get everything ready.

15:50.423 --> 15:52.088
You're dismissed.

15:53.725 --> 15:55.692
With all due respect, I
think I should be present

15:55.694 --> 15:57.860
for the extraction.

15:57.862 --> 15:59.996
It's no secret my husband was killed

15:59.998 --> 16:03.032
during an Inazagi rescue operation.

16:03.034 --> 16:06.169
And he's a hero to
everyone in this company.

16:06.171 --> 16:08.671
If anything went wrong, I
couldn't put Laura through

16:08.673 --> 16:09.905
something like that again.

16:09.907 --> 16:11.273
Yeah, I understand.

16:11.275 --> 16:13.041
But someone needs to reprogram the Kusari

16:13.043 --> 16:15.110
in a matter of seconds
and fool it into accepting

16:15.112 --> 16:17.145
the girl's body as Diana Walters.

16:17.147 --> 16:21.283
I may not be a field agent,
but I'm the best coder you have.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.688
You really want this promotion, don't you?

16:26.690 --> 16:28.155
More than anything.

16:35.632 --> 16:37.465
It's here.

16:39.436 --> 16:40.635
It's me, Victor.

16:40.637 --> 16:42.303
I've got a client for ya.

17:01.188 --> 17:05.022
<i>Put all of your devices
inside the locker, please.</i>

17:22.576 --> 17:26.243
<i>So tell me... what can
a lowly Red Zone cracker</i>

17:26.246 --> 17:29.481
<i>do for the cream of the
crop of the almighty Spiga?</i>

17:29.483 --> 17:33.284
I need help bypassing a
self-destruct protocol.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.590
You poor suits.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.759
Always trying to catch up.

17:46.136 --> 17:47.556
How many kids get it, really?

17:47.558 --> 17:49.309
I'm not just any kid, you're looking at

17:49.311 --> 17:50.883
an honor student, here.

17:50.885 --> 17:52.327
Hey, I'm impressed, don't get me wrong.

17:52.329 --> 17:56.118
It's just the scholarship
seems like a con to me.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.940
And they pick, what, one Red Zone brainiac

17:57.942 --> 17:59.014
out of every 10,000?

18:00.150 --> 18:02.951
Who you calling
"brainiac," you petty thief?

18:02.953 --> 18:04.931
You think I'm still hacking rations?

18:04.933 --> 18:09.024
I'm pulling blackcoins off
watches now... cyberhauls.

18:09.026 --> 18:11.430
That shit's gonna get you killed, you know?

18:11.432 --> 18:13.794
That shit kept me alive and fed till now.

18:13.796 --> 18:15.830
Hmm. Here it is.

18:15.832 --> 18:18.458
- See you after class?
- Of course.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.302
We have five years of
catching up to catch up on.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.599
Uh, don't worry about it, it's nothing.

18:48.229 --> 18:52.030
<i>Today's lesson is brought
to you by Kamikaze Burger.</i>

18:52.032 --> 18:56.235
<i>Home of the Double Whammy...
now with 10% real beef.</i>

18:56.237 --> 19:01.206
<i>Chemistry lesson will
start in three, two, one.</i>

19:31.182 --> 19:32.474
Elena!

19:32.476 --> 19:35.238
Hey, wake up! Come on!

19:45.449 --> 19:47.016
Hey! Okay.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.919
Elena?

19:49.921 --> 19:51.987
Okay. All right.

19:51.989 --> 19:53.988
It's okay. Elena.

19:55.657 --> 19:57.792
Yeah.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.335
Aaron?

20:07.337 --> 20:10.304
Hey there, brainiac.

20:10.306 --> 20:13.107
Let's go.

20:14.509 --> 20:16.585
Where are we going?

20:16.587 --> 20:17.978
Out of here.

20:19.949 --> 20:22.349
We've kept her "on ice," if you will,

20:22.351 --> 20:23.917
for the last few days.

20:23.919 --> 20:26.887
Sometimes we get guests
with very specialized tastes

20:26.889 --> 20:29.455
that we can't always
cater to, which is a shame.

20:29.457 --> 20:31.858
So when she got shot, I thought,

20:31.860 --> 20:33.626
"Well, lemonade, right?"

20:34.796 --> 20:36.729
Over at Arcadia, we always strive...

20:36.731 --> 20:39.098
You are aware that this
is someone's daughter

20:39.100 --> 20:40.133
you're talking about?

20:46.240 --> 20:47.272
You okay?

20:47.274 --> 20:49.574
Yeah, just...

20:49.576 --> 20:51.542
surprised... I thought the procedure

20:51.544 --> 20:52.878
was going to be done here.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.213
Well, had to move it up.

20:55.215 --> 20:56.848
I sent the surgical team to Arcadia

20:56.850 --> 20:58.683
to change the companion's face.

20:58.685 --> 21:02.219
Couldn't risk them being spotted on site.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.855
- Smart.
- Mm.

21:04.857 --> 21:06.423
Let's get set up.

21:09.428 --> 21:10.795
Who was she?

21:12.731 --> 21:14.231
Her?

21:15.868 --> 21:18.102
Someone desperate.

21:18.104 --> 21:20.369
People out there...

21:20.371 --> 21:22.138
life pushes them hard enough,

21:22.140 --> 21:23.706
they'll sign anything.

21:25.277 --> 21:27.210
Someone like you wouldn't understand.

21:32.851 --> 21:34.517
<i>A keyhole.</i>

21:34.519 --> 21:36.351
This allows you to snoop into any system

21:36.353 --> 21:37.519
without leaving footprints.

21:37.521 --> 21:40.388
Not exactly corporate tech.

21:40.390 --> 21:41.756
What kind of trouble you in?

21:41.758 --> 21:43.692
No trouble at all.

21:43.694 --> 21:45.828
You sure?

21:45.830 --> 21:48.197
A climber like you gets caught
with something like this,

21:48.199 --> 21:49.965
he's gonna get spanked.

21:49.967 --> 21:51.300
Or worse.

21:51.302 --> 21:54.101
I hear that Spiga security
can be very inventive

21:54.103 --> 21:55.469
with a cattle prod.

21:55.471 --> 21:56.737
Let's talk business.

21:56.739 --> 21:58.072
If I wanted to listen to an old hag

21:58.074 --> 22:01.242
talk dirty, I'd give my mom a call.

22:01.244 --> 22:04.879
Your mother's dead.

22:04.881 --> 22:06.547
Like hell she is.

22:09.169 --> 22:11.401
Lung cancer in '69.

22:11.403 --> 22:13.804
Right before you joined Spiga.

22:13.806 --> 22:15.305
That's too bad.

22:15.307 --> 22:17.140
She would've been so proud of you.

22:20.312 --> 22:22.412
It's what I do, son.

22:22.414 --> 22:25.748
Enough with the chitchat.
How do I crack it?

22:25.750 --> 22:29.018
I could encode a skeleton key for you.

22:29.020 --> 22:32.321
That would bypass the
self-destruct protocol.

22:32.323 --> 22:33.789
Good.

22:35.259 --> 22:38.794
Just say when so I can get
the hell out of this shithole.

22:41.933 --> 22:44.265
When was the last time you were out here?

22:44.267 --> 22:45.499
Out here?

22:45.501 --> 22:46.600
Outside the wall.

22:46.602 --> 22:48.402
Rubbing elbows with the skints.

22:48.404 --> 22:50.872
Oh, last Friday, why?

22:50.874 --> 22:53.741
Let me guess. Scored a little blur,

22:53.743 --> 22:55.476
some eye candy, maybe took in

22:55.478 --> 22:58.146
the conjoined-twins
freak show down on Fifth.

22:58.148 --> 23:00.148
What do you want?

23:00.150 --> 23:02.249
The same thing you do.

23:02.251 --> 23:04.117
Entertainment.

23:09.091 --> 23:12.492
- You see her?
- See what?

23:12.494 --> 23:15.462
Beady eyes, pair of whiskers, long tail.

23:16.732 --> 23:19.565
The rat?

23:19.567 --> 23:23.102
I want you to catch it.

23:23.104 --> 23:24.636
You're kidding.

23:24.638 --> 23:28.040
Dead or alive, your call.

23:28.042 --> 23:31.010
- You're a fucking cu...
- Eh, eh, eh.

23:31.012 --> 23:33.275
You kiss your dead mom with that mouth?

23:33.277 --> 23:34.259
Forget it.

23:34.261 --> 23:37.048
- I'll find someone else.
- You won't.

23:37.050 --> 23:38.716
No one's gonna give you a skeleton key

23:38.718 --> 23:40.785
if I tell 'em not to.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.156
I'll give you one, though.

23:45.158 --> 23:46.925
All you got to do is catch a little animal

23:46.927 --> 23:49.027
with a brain the size of a peanut.

23:49.029 --> 23:50.728
How hard can that be?

24:04.043 --> 24:05.509
Ugh, motherfuck!

24:05.511 --> 24:07.577
Now that's entertainment.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.923
Upset, betrayed... I mean,

24:19.925 --> 24:23.659
I-I-I don't know
how else to put it.

24:23.661 --> 24:25.261
We've been good to you.

24:25.263 --> 24:26.728
That you would do this to us is...

24:26.730 --> 24:30.032
I didn't do it for me.

24:30.034 --> 24:32.367
The people in my building,
we... we have a fund.

24:32.369 --> 24:33.701
We all contribute.

24:33.703 --> 24:35.770
$50 a month, every family.

24:35.772 --> 24:38.573
If there's an emergency,
you can access the money.

24:38.575 --> 24:40.902
My neighbor, Rosa, she missed a payment.

24:40.904 --> 24:42.510
You have to understand...
you don't miss a payment.

24:42.512 --> 24:44.979
You miss a payment and you're out.

24:44.981 --> 24:49.417
Your neighbor, what did
she need the money for?

24:49.419 --> 24:51.547
A doctor. Her daughter, there...

24:51.549 --> 24:52.753
there's something wrong with her belly.

24:52.755 --> 24:56.023
I've been hearing her scream
through the night, so...

24:56.025 --> 24:58.659
Excuse me if I hurt your feelings.

24:58.661 --> 25:02.062
Is the pain on her right side?

25:02.064 --> 25:03.529
I'm not sure.

25:03.531 --> 25:05.265
Well, it could be appendicitis.

25:05.267 --> 25:09.002
Yeah, well, I'll make sure they
include that in her obituary.

25:09.004 --> 25:11.871
Now, if you don't mind,
I assume I'm out of a job.

25:13.141 --> 25:14.874
Bring her in.

25:17.478 --> 25:20.745
Excuse me?

25:20.747 --> 25:22.881
Your friend's daughter.

25:22.883 --> 25:25.376
Bring her tonight, I'll examine her.

25:26.979 --> 25:29.013
The kid's not authorized to enter.

25:31.517 --> 25:34.183
I'll sign her in.

25:34.185 --> 25:37.186
You bring her to the
gate and I'll sign her in.

25:43.995 --> 25:45.628
Don't worry.

25:45.630 --> 25:47.163
I'll wait till the very last second

25:47.165 --> 25:48.631
before I activate the venom.

25:48.633 --> 25:50.766
And then how much time do we have?

25:50.768 --> 25:53.968
The moment it hits her, five
minutes to bring her back.

25:53.970 --> 25:57.939
Longer than that, and we'll lose the baby.

25:57.941 --> 26:01.276
Tell me this isn't the
craziest thing we've ever done.

26:01.278 --> 26:03.245
Now you want me to lie to you?

26:04.549 --> 26:06.550
A fruitful negotiation

26:06.552 --> 26:09.787
calls for a celebration.

26:09.789 --> 26:12.122
A celebration...

26:12.124 --> 26:16.125
of kinship and unity.

26:16.127 --> 26:18.486
We are, after all,

26:18.488 --> 26:22.581
but simple cells in the body corporate.

26:22.583 --> 26:25.659
Our bodies are temples.

26:25.661 --> 26:27.769
Unsullied.

26:27.771 --> 26:29.255
Pure.

26:29.257 --> 26:33.325
This man's body is a dump.

26:33.327 --> 26:37.028
But we thank him for his sacrifice.

26:37.030 --> 26:40.398
To the infinite glory
of the corporate mother.

27:11.225 --> 27:12.552
What's wrong with her?

27:12.554 --> 27:13.849
I don't know. She was linked.

27:13.851 --> 27:15.463
She was in the group...
must be some sort of reaction

27:15.465 --> 27:17.201
- to the neural connect...
- Where is the doctor?

27:17.203 --> 27:19.727
Can I get the doctor in
here immediately, please?

27:19.729 --> 27:22.471
- He's on his way!
- Jesus, she has no pulse.

27:22.473 --> 27:24.039
She's gonna be fine, Richard.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.281
We're gonna bring her back.

27:25.283 --> 27:27.476
Step aside, please.

27:29.413 --> 27:31.213
She's gone into cardiac arrest.

27:34.335 --> 27:35.888
Stand back. 400 joules.

27:35.890 --> 27:37.844
- Wait! Stop.
- What is it?

27:37.846 --> 27:40.011
There's something in
her blood, a tech virus.

27:40.013 --> 27:41.588
The electrical shock will set it off.

27:41.590 --> 27:44.383
- If you zap her, she dies.
- I don't zap her, she dies.

27:44.385 --> 27:45.617
Shit.

27:45.619 --> 27:47.220
- Can you disarm it?
- I...

27:47.222 --> 27:48.999
Sir, if you can, you have
to disarm it right now.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.190
- I'm not...
- Right now!

27:50.192 --> 27:52.291
- Authorized.
- We're losing her.

27:54.662 --> 27:57.695
Go, go.

27:57.697 --> 27:59.530
400 joules.

28:02.702 --> 28:05.803
500 joules.

28:05.805 --> 28:07.438
Okay, we need to get her in an ambulance.

28:11.611 --> 28:13.449
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:13.451 --> 28:15.610
Get out! I'm not authorized
to leave her alone.

28:15.612 --> 28:18.548
I'm trying to save her life, do
you really want to take my place?

28:20.853 --> 28:22.419
We'll meet you downstairs.

28:28.394 --> 28:30.493
- How long have we got?
- 17 seconds.

28:34.132 --> 28:35.265
Bring her back.

28:35.267 --> 28:37.700
Not until you crack the Kusari.

28:37.702 --> 28:39.535
We have to give them a body.

28:44.809 --> 28:46.474
Come on, we're gonna lose her.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.077
Working on it.

28:49.079 --> 28:51.046
We're almost there.

28:51.048 --> 28:52.214
It's uploading.

29:08.264 --> 29:09.830
She's gone.

29:19.475 --> 29:21.141
I'm sorry.

29:25.660 --> 29:27.772
_

29:34.589 --> 29:37.456
Take SVP Walters's body away.

29:43.730 --> 29:46.098
You must really want this thing.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.799
You sure you're not in trouble?

29:47.801 --> 29:50.502
Look, I've done what you asked.

29:50.504 --> 29:52.471
Which makes me wonder.

29:52.473 --> 29:54.339
Your dad is George Caplan,

29:54.341 --> 29:57.375
CEO of one of Spiga's biggest suppliers.

29:57.377 --> 30:00.979
What's George Caplan's son
doing chasing a skeleton key

30:00.981 --> 30:02.313
in the Red Zone?

30:02.315 --> 30:05.146
- What kind of a fuck-up are you?
- I'm not a f...

30:05.148 --> 30:08.086
Didn't you get a girl killed once,

30:08.088 --> 30:10.521
messing around with
your dad's car autodrive?

30:10.523 --> 30:12.122
Yeah, well, you seem
to know a lot about me.

30:12.124 --> 30:15.125
Why don't you tell me a little
something about yourself?

30:15.127 --> 30:17.361
Well, there's not that much to tell.

30:17.363 --> 30:20.497
I got here with the first
wave of climate refugees.

30:20.499 --> 30:23.166
Chased up north by the sand storms.

30:23.168 --> 30:25.535
Government rations were never enough.

30:25.537 --> 30:28.204
You were probably sucking
on your gestator's tit

30:28.206 --> 30:29.838
while my brother and I had to scramble

30:29.840 --> 30:31.673
for enough protein.

30:31.675 --> 30:34.710
Sometimes there was only one source of it.

30:34.712 --> 30:37.413
Although it was everywhere, really.

30:39.250 --> 30:41.083
I'd tell you it tastes like chicken,

30:41.085 --> 30:44.387
but I don't really remember
what chicken tastes like.

30:47.290 --> 30:50.025
Why don't you tell me if
it tastes like chicken?

30:50.994 --> 30:54.362
- You want me to...
- Eat it.

30:54.364 --> 30:58.366
I want George Caplan's fuck-up of a son

30:58.368 --> 31:01.202
to eat it.

31:01.204 --> 31:04.371
You're sick.

31:04.373 --> 31:05.605
I'm also the only person

31:05.607 --> 31:08.942
that can get you that skeleton key.

31:08.944 --> 31:11.078
Now, how bad do you want it?

31:15.084 --> 31:18.285
I'm here to sign in two workers.

31:18.287 --> 31:19.652
She's here.

31:19.654 --> 31:20.986
There's a problem, ma'am.

31:20.988 --> 31:23.022
There were two names on the log.

31:23.024 --> 31:24.057
Right.

31:24.059 --> 31:26.459
Two servers to help with the dinner party.

31:26.461 --> 31:28.661
Well, take a look.

31:33.668 --> 31:35.634
Hands off the gate.

31:41.575 --> 31:43.708
Rachel?

31:45.579 --> 31:47.479
- Rachel!
- Ms. Larson.

31:47.481 --> 31:48.913
Who are all these people?

31:48.915 --> 31:50.248
I don't know what happened.

31:50.250 --> 31:53.250
They heard and word spread we were coming.

31:53.252 --> 31:55.286
Are they sick?

31:55.288 --> 31:56.720
Yeah.

31:56.722 --> 31:58.189
Ma'am, this is a breach hazard.

31:58.191 --> 31:59.523
I know.

31:59.525 --> 32:02.159
These people aren't authorized
to be in the perimeter.

32:02.161 --> 32:04.027
They are, they're on the log.

32:04.029 --> 32:05.229
Let them in.

32:07.633 --> 32:08.632
These two.

32:08.634 --> 32:10.166
These two only!

32:14.239 --> 32:15.505
Back off!

32:17.709 --> 32:19.609
Can you Le...

32:19.611 --> 32:21.777
- I said back off!
- Open the gate!

32:21.779 --> 32:23.346
Okay, fuck this!

32:23.348 --> 32:24.347
Engage!

32:30.787 --> 32:32.387
Let me in!

32:32.389 --> 32:34.055
Can you grab my hand?

32:34.057 --> 32:34.856
Aah!

32:40.897 --> 32:42.331
Here, come on. Oh!

32:59.616 --> 33:04.417
Uh, Mr. Morse requested the
companion's personal effects.

33:04.419 --> 33:06.286
Yeah.

33:35.298 --> 33:37.766
What are we doing here?

33:37.768 --> 33:41.103
This is what I like to
call my screaming place.

33:42.406 --> 33:44.339
- Your screaming place?
- Yeah.

33:44.341 --> 33:47.008
Every time I get evicted...

33:47.010 --> 33:52.380
or shaken down by a cop or a
blurhead takes a swing at me,

33:52.382 --> 33:54.148
I come here.

33:54.150 --> 33:55.984
And I scream my guts out.

33:59.956 --> 34:02.222
I wouldn't know what to scream about.

34:02.224 --> 34:04.191
You're shitting me, right?

34:04.193 --> 34:06.393
You spend 17 hours a day in that juku

34:06.395 --> 34:08.027
letting them pump you with nootropics

34:08.030 --> 34:10.864
and cognitive enhancers and...

34:10.866 --> 34:13.632
Don't forget the amphetamines.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.770
Sometimes I'm so wired, I just...

34:16.772 --> 34:20.039
spend the whole night
staring at the ceiling.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.940
Still hearing the lessons in my head.

34:21.943 --> 34:23.609
Jesus, Lena.

34:23.610 --> 34:25.577
You're the one who's gonna get killed.

34:25.579 --> 34:27.478
How many of these seizures
have you had already?

34:27.481 --> 34:29.282
Oh, you don't understand.

34:31.518 --> 34:36.021
When things are tough at
home and money's short,

34:36.023 --> 34:39.157
I eat first.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.994
Then Theo, then my dad.

34:42.996 --> 34:45.630
And I get the best mattress,

34:45.632 --> 34:48.166
even if I can't really enjoy it.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.536
Anything so the straight-A student

34:51.538 --> 34:53.770
can keep getting straight "A" s.

34:53.772 --> 34:56.106
So...

34:56.108 --> 34:59.276
how can I complain?

34:59.278 --> 35:03.880
They just have so much
riding on this scholarship.

35:03.882 --> 35:06.216
On me.

35:06.218 --> 35:08.452
What about you?

35:08.454 --> 35:10.786
You got to come up and
breathe every once in a while,

35:10.788 --> 35:11.921
you got to live.

35:13.891 --> 35:15.258
And by "live," you mean screaming

35:15.260 --> 35:16.559
at the top of your lungs?

35:16.561 --> 35:18.828
Hey, don't knock it till you try it.

35:18.830 --> 35:22.065
And it definitely helps
you forget an empty stomach.

35:22.067 --> 35:24.067
I promise.

35:25.670 --> 35:26.835
Come on.

35:26.837 --> 35:28.803
Give it a shot.

35:41.718 --> 35:43.584
So how did that feel?

35:43.586 --> 35:45.152
Not bad, huh?

35:45.154 --> 35:46.753
Yeah.

35:46.755 --> 35:49.823
Yeah, you got some lungs on you, girl, wow.

35:52.295 --> 35:54.328
I think I can do better.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.464
Please, do your worst.

36:02.337 --> 36:04.304
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

36:26.118 --> 36:28.252
Ben?

36:30.889 --> 36:34.557
You did excellent work today.

36:34.559 --> 36:38.061
I'll make sure the board takes notice.

36:38.063 --> 36:39.562
Ms. Walters is stable.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.364
The Kusari's being
flushed out of her system

36:41.366 --> 36:42.865
as we speak.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.634
She should be ready for
debriefing in the next 24 hours.

36:45.636 --> 36:48.204
- And her child?
- Unharmed.

36:52.176 --> 36:54.309
I'll deliver this to the family.

36:54.311 --> 36:56.378
You know you don't have to.

37:07.657 --> 37:09.190
Oh, I got to hand it to you,

37:09.192 --> 37:11.858
you goddamn suits are ambitious.

37:12.861 --> 37:14.995
Hungry, even.

37:14.997 --> 37:17.231
There.

37:17.233 --> 37:19.333
You earned it.

37:22.505 --> 37:25.105
I encoded your key in a
piece of organic material,

37:25.107 --> 37:27.073
undetectable to your scanners.

37:27.075 --> 37:28.374
That's a freebie.

37:33.014 --> 37:36.583
You... you recorded it?

37:36.585 --> 37:38.684
For my own personal collection.

37:47.328 --> 37:50.262
If I ever see you around here again,

37:50.264 --> 37:51.630
I'm gonna share that video

37:51.632 --> 37:55.834
with every single one of your contacts.

37:55.836 --> 37:57.636
Go home, suit.

37:57.638 --> 38:00.271
Don't forget to take your antibiotics.

38:00.273 --> 38:02.840
Those little bastards
carry all sorts of bugs.

38:13.186 --> 38:14.385
Laura?

38:17.222 --> 38:18.255
Everything okay?

38:18.257 --> 38:20.123
Yeah.

38:20.125 --> 38:23.527
Just tired.

38:23.529 --> 38:25.962
Boring day at work.

38:25.964 --> 38:28.865
Yeah.

38:28.867 --> 38:31.000
Mine, too.

38:35.339 --> 38:37.406
I've been thinking, and...

38:39.577 --> 38:41.710
I'm gonna clear my schedule.

38:43.881 --> 38:46.948
- Ben.
- Forget about the promotion.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.921
After all, we're...

38:53.923 --> 38:57.592
doing pretty well for ourselves, right?

38:57.594 --> 38:59.561
Right.

38:59.563 --> 39:03.964
How's Wednesday for the appointment?

39:03.966 --> 39:05.800
It's perfect.

39:13.312 --> 39:17.072
I'm here to thank you for your
daughter's service to the company.

39:17.074 --> 39:20.050
Which was greater than you could imagine.

39:22.488 --> 39:26.423
These are her personal effects.

39:26.425 --> 39:30.928
But where is my baby?

39:30.930 --> 39:34.992
Unfortunately, we cannot
return her body to you.

39:35.763 --> 39:38.710
_

39:39.169 --> 39:41.637
_

39:50.665 --> 39:53.265
Like I said, I-I'm sorry.

39:53.267 --> 39:56.334
I can't imagine anything
worse than losing a child.

40:01.508 --> 40:02.740
Theo.

40:02.742 --> 40:05.409
Jesus.

40:05.411 --> 40:06.711
Where's Anthony?

40:06.713 --> 40:07.879
I waited till he left.

40:07.881 --> 40:11.082
He didn't see me.

40:11.084 --> 40:14.818
What are you doing here?

40:18.491 --> 40:20.657
I'm sorry, Theo.

40:24.630 --> 40:26.930
Where'd you get this?

40:26.932 --> 40:29.966
She tried to escape.

40:29.968 --> 40:32.969
- She...
- I couldn't.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.840
I failed.

40:37.842 --> 40:39.809
I didn't get to her in time.

<i>Familial DNA detected.</i>

40:49.289 --> 40:50.886
<i>Play recording.</i>

40:50.888 --> 40:52.621
<i>Hey, Theo.</i>

40:52.623 --> 40:54.656
<i>It's me, your big sis.</i>

40:54.658 --> 40:57.258
<i>If you're watching this,
that means Melissa's</i>

40:57.260 --> 41:00.729
<i>managed to escape and
given you Mom's ring.</i>

41:00.731 --> 41:02.263
<i>She's a good friend.</i>

41:02.265 --> 41:03.916
<i>Try to help her as much as you can.</i>

41:03.918 --> 41:05.106
She's still alive.

41:05.108 --> 41:08.386
<i>She's had a tough life,
but she's a survivor.</i>

41:08.388 --> 41:10.037
<i>Like we are.</i>

41:10.039 --> 41:13.774
<i>Um, the reason I'm recording this</i>

41:13.776 --> 41:16.408
<i>is there have been rumors</i>

41:16.410 --> 41:18.512
<i>going around.</i>

41:18.514 --> 41:21.681
<i>Girls getting NDA-ed at
the end of their contracts.</i>

41:21.683 --> 41:24.984
<i>We've seen too much,
I guess, and they...</i>

41:24.986 --> 41:27.820
<i>they want to wipe our minds clean.</i>

41:27.822 --> 41:30.723
<i>I'm sure it was buried
somewhere in the fine print.</i>

41:30.725 --> 41:36.728
<i>But, um, if you see me
years from now, and...</i>

41:36.730 --> 41:40.231
<i>and I don't recognize you...</i>

41:40.233 --> 41:42.601
<i>please don't hate me.</i>

41:42.603 --> 41:45.671
<i>I want you to know that I love you.</i>

41:45.673 --> 41:48.540
<i>And I'll always be your big sis.</i>
