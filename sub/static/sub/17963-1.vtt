02:48.484 --> 02:51.949
Cornelius, come get your dinner.

03:44.173 --> 03:45.705
Cornelius.

03:50.782 --> 03:52.613
Cornelius, are you deaf?

03:54.116 --> 03:58.185
What in the hell do you think
you're doing? Cornelius!

04:01.598 --> 04:04.026
Cornelius! What are you doing?

04:04.126 --> 04:06.929
What the hell? Cornelius!

04:10.433 --> 04:13.264
No! No! No!

04:13.364 --> 04:16.250
No! No!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.374
Was that a bear?

07:41.310 --> 07:44.599
- I think it was a man.
- A man-bear?

07:45.347 --> 07:47.201
No, just a man.

07:49.051 --> 07:52.805
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.857
Goddammit, Woody.

07:54.957 --> 07:58.027
I thought you said
you was straight to drive, man.

08:03.339 --> 08:06.498
- What was that?
- I think it's under the truck.

08:14.443 --> 08:18.577
This is like that movie, where they ran over
that dude and they thought they killed 'im...

08:18.677 --> 08:22.119
...but they didn't and then he came back
next summer and then he killed them.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.635
Shit, that's gonna happen to us.

08:26.255 --> 08:29.191
- We're gonna die!
- Goddammit, Woody, we ain't gonna die.

08:29.291 --> 08:33.163
Now back this fucking truck up, so we
can get can get the fuck out of here.

08:43.172 --> 08:45.060
What the fuck?

08:47.259 --> 08:49.803
- Fuck this.
- Yes, sir.

09:08.781 --> 09:11.617
<i>With a long-anticipated
senior year around the corner...</i>

09:11.717 --> 09:15.354
<i>...I think it's time to join
the secret society of sleep addicts.</i>

09:15.504 --> 09:16.605
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

09:16.705 --> 09:20.676
<i>I dream loudly, but I have to buckle down
if I want to get into a good college.</i>

09:20.776 --> 09:23.880
<i>I don't wanna jinx myself.
Forget school for now.</i>

09:23.980 --> 09:28.050
<i>After today, it's officially
beach week and I can't wait.</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:31.220
<i>I'm going with my BFF
since grade school, Carrie...</i>

09:31.320 --> 09:35.157
- <i>...and her stupe-ass boyfriend, Freddy.</i>
- Spring break, bitches.

09:35.257 --> 09:38.608
<i>I swear, one day, I hope he knocks
himself out doing that pose.</i>

09:40.429 --> 09:42.898
- Have a seat, Fredrick.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:42.998 --> 09:44.801
Hey, buddy.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.087
<i>Then there's Jason. He's my half-cousin.</i>

09:48.187 --> 09:52.341
<i>Which doesn't stop him from trying
to put the moves on me. Barf.</i>

09:54.809 --> 09:58.180
<i>Brooklyn, my other BFF,
Samara's douche-boyfriend.</i>

09:58.280 --> 10:01.617
<i>He moved here in the sixth grade
but still claims New York.</i>

10:01.717 --> 10:04.086
<i>Ew, I wish he would move back.</i>

10:04.186 --> 10:06.856
<i>Which brings me to Samara,
she's in geometry...</i>

10:06.956 --> 10:09.525
<i>...probably chewing gum
and playing with her hair.</i>

10:09.625 --> 10:13.095
<i>So, pen's off to you, dear journal,
let's make this one black, white, red...</i>

10:13.195 --> 10:15.419
<i>...and awesome. All over.</i>

10:17.033 --> 10:19.135
Okay, class, settle down.

10:19.235 --> 10:22.272
I want you to spend the remainder
of the class reading Chapter 13...

10:22.372 --> 10:24.707
...on moving proteins into membranes.

10:24.807 --> 10:27.209
I've got some protein that needs moving.

10:27.310 --> 10:30.798
You can move yourself to
the Principal's office, if you like.

10:31.614 --> 10:35.041
That's what I thought.
Now begin reading, class.

10:44.260 --> 10:48.931
<i># I woke up one morning and I kicked my dog</i>

10:49.031 --> 10:54.520
<i># I beat my neighbor's head in
with a big maple log</i>

10:54.620 --> 10:58.674
<i># Then I called his big fat hairy wife
a big fat hairy slob</i>

10:58.774 --> 11:01.977
<i># I had the blues</i>

11:02.077 --> 11:05.933
<i># The mean motherfucker blues ##</i>

11:20.062 --> 11:24.091
- Yes, Pamela?
- May I be excused to the restroom?

11:29.638 --> 11:31.741
- Hey, soldier.
- Hey, you.

11:31.841 --> 11:34.343
- You miss me?
- Oh, a little.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.879
- You ass.
- Okay, okay.

11:36.979 --> 11:40.838
- I missed you.
- Get me the fuck out of here.

11:47.189 --> 11:49.228
Fuck school!

11:52.728 --> 11:54.615
Quiet down.

12:10.746 --> 12:12.381
What happened?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.216
I should've dumped his ass a long time ago.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.380
What did he do this time?

12:19.421 --> 12:21.891
Don't cock-block me at the beach?

12:22.591 --> 12:25.261
You have gotta go, it's not
gonna be the same without you.

12:25.361 --> 12:27.248
No chance.

12:31.901 --> 12:33.584
- Hey, Christine.
- Hey.

12:33.684 --> 12:35.871
- Did you talk to Samara?
- Yeah, she's not coming.

12:35.971 --> 12:37.773
How many times is she
gonna put up with his shit?

12:37.873 --> 12:39.760
A million.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.880
I hope that kid falls.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.204
<i>Yo.</i>

12:46.849 --> 12:48.669
Smell this.

12:52.922 --> 12:55.191
- Dank
- Stank killah killah.

12:55.291 --> 12:58.427
- Can I smell?
- These aren't cut up Twinkies, Jason.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.548
Fucking lard ass.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.729
Oh, my God, what the fuck is he doing here?

13:14.176 --> 13:16.111
What's he doing here?

13:16.211 --> 13:19.014
- Samara's not coming.
- I told him he could still come.

13:19.114 --> 13:22.770
- Why do you do that?
- Because he has the weed.

13:24.019 --> 13:26.073
Get off my nuts.

14:24.053 --> 14:25.666
Hello?

16:02.244 --> 16:03.764
Bathroom?

16:08.550 --> 16:10.438
It's around back.

16:24.967 --> 16:28.020
Woody, Woody.

16:28.870 --> 16:30.973
Woody, Woody.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.328
- What now?
- Hey, man.

16:36.211 --> 16:38.266
Go pay for petrol, man.

16:44.453 --> 16:46.785
This isn't enough to get to Mexico on.

17:52.671 --> 17:56.294
Hey, asshole, what the fuck you looking at?

19:27.366 --> 19:30.535
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- What the fuck'd you do, Woody?

19:30.635 --> 19:33.705
Road beers. Oh, shit.

20:10.175 --> 20:14.232
<i>Continue on this route for 87 miles.</i>

20:15.714 --> 20:18.763
Yo, can that GPS tell us where
we could get some dank nugs?

20:18.863 --> 20:20.753
I wish.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.955
So, what's the first thing you guys are
gonna do when you get to the beach?

20:24.055 --> 20:26.491
I'm gonna get fucking drunk.

20:26.591 --> 20:28.727
I can't wait to just lay out.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.929
Me too, and take a dip in the ocean.

20:31.029 --> 20:34.500
- I can't wait to part that motherfucker.
- Yeah, swim, for sure.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.702
You gonna swim with your
shirt on again, Jason?

20:36.802 --> 20:40.606
- What, I get sunburned easy.
- Yeah, it's not 'cause of your mits?

20:41.706 --> 20:44.095
- Mits?
- Yeah, man tits.

20:44.195 --> 20:45.444
Shut up, Freddy.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.579
I told you I was born with an extra thyroid.

20:47.679 --> 20:51.250
- And two stomachs like a cow.
- Cows have four stomachs, dumbass.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.485
Don't be jealous 'cause Jason
has bigger tits than you.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.887
- Fuck you, Freddy.
- Don't be a dick.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.671
What?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.412
Cool, weed.

21:02.961 --> 21:05.429
What, I can get down.

21:07.899 --> 21:12.255
Hey, so, why did Samara bail again?

21:12.471 --> 21:15.740
Oh, she had crabs,
she didn't wanna give it to everybody.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.895
Smart ass.

21:19.478 --> 21:21.839
Yeah, right.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.401
Yeah, I need to take you
small-town peeps to BK...

21:36.501 --> 21:38.463
...show you how we get down
for real, for real.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.833
Yeah, I could go for a Whopper.

21:41.533 --> 21:44.035
No, man, I'm talking about Brooklyn, fool.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.371
I thought you said you were from Syracuse.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.674
Well, yeah, I mean, I am
but I hung out in Brooklyn a lot.

21:49.774 --> 21:53.545
- That's where my cousins stay at.
- Aren't they like, really far apart?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.914
Like hundreds of miles?

21:56.014 --> 21:59.051
Yeah, I live like right on the line.
What are you, The Riddler or something?

21:59.151 --> 22:02.343
Stop asking me so many questions.
I'm trying to roll this blunt.

22:20.405 --> 22:24.728
You know, this shit right here is the truth.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.235
What the fuck?

22:33.118 --> 22:36.521
Oh, shit, what.
Yo, this dude got a hard-on, yo.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.690
- No, I don't.
- Fucking perv.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.016
Gross!

22:40.116 --> 22:43.167
What, I don't even know
what you guys are talking about.

22:45.230 --> 22:47.056
I have to go to the bathroom.

24:12.183 --> 24:15.807
Hey, Jason, bring me back a sweet tea.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.352
Hi, where is your bathroom?

24:29.801 --> 24:31.822
Who wants to know?

24:32.604 --> 24:36.676
Uh, me? I really need
to use your bathroom, miss.

24:38.109 --> 24:41.137
- It's around back, darling.
- Thank you.

24:41.780 --> 24:45.228
Honey, ain't you forgetting something?

24:46.818 --> 24:49.579
- You need a key.
- Oh.

24:51.259 --> 24:52.443
Thanks.

24:54.459 --> 24:58.231
Don't you be going and flushing your
bloody tampons down that toilet...

24:58.331 --> 25:01.730
...and leaving 'em all which-away, you
throw 'em in the goddamn trash, you hear?

25:01.830 --> 25:04.700
Um, okay.

25:05.336 --> 25:09.544
All you high school girls bleed
like Dracula fucked Willy Wonka...

25:09.644 --> 25:12.811
...and formed a blood factory and
slaughtered all those Oompa Loompas...

25:12.911 --> 25:15.046
...and made a bunch of bloody Marys.

25:15.146 --> 25:17.750
Vagina Coyote Uglies.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.585
A lot of Draculas' wives went out
on a night on the town...

25:20.685 --> 25:24.507
...and went to a bachelor party and
all had their periods at the same time.

25:27.158 --> 25:29.012
Yes, ma'am.

25:40.071 --> 25:42.874
Oh, my God.

25:42.974 --> 25:44.994
What the fuck?

25:48.813 --> 25:51.282
- Alright, you guys ready?
- Just zooming out.

25:51.382 --> 25:55.821
- This is so fucked up, Freddy.
- Shut up or I'm gonna get you next.

25:55.921 --> 25:57.827
Ready.

26:04.862 --> 26:06.543
There it is.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.402
You better not get me this time.

26:11.502 --> 26:13.959
You're safe, for now.

26:27.819 --> 26:29.273
Fuck.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.812
What the fuck is she doing?

26:53.912 --> 26:56.948
Dropping the kids off at the pool
and giving them swimming lessons?

26:57.048 --> 26:58.665
You're so gross.

27:45.363 --> 27:48.900
That fucking bitch!

27:49.000 --> 27:53.490
I knew I couldn't fucking trust her.
Goddammit, I knew it!

27:56.875 --> 28:00.478
Just relax, Dirk, you don't wanna Hulk out.

28:00.578 --> 28:04.336
It's been six weeks
since you've been laid, just...

28:05.429 --> 28:07.480
...just be cool.

28:15.726 --> 28:18.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:18.480 --> 28:20.899
What's wrong, you look like
somebody killed your cat.

28:20.999 --> 28:24.669
Cat? I don't have a fucking cat.

28:24.769 --> 28:27.406
Are you mistaking me for someone else?

28:27.806 --> 28:30.476
It's an expression, what's your problem?

28:31.676 --> 28:34.129
Express this, bitch.

28:34.579 --> 28:36.399
Hello, Dirk?

28:38.416 --> 28:43.106
Cat? I'm a fucking dog person,
don't you know me at all?

29:39.709 --> 29:42.532
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck?

29:43.982 --> 29:45.984
- Pull over!
- Oh, my God, Carrie!

29:46.084 --> 29:47.971
Freddy, pull over.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.471
- Oh, what did you eat?
- Shut up, Freddy.

30:06.571 --> 30:08.660
Oh, Shit!

30:11.676 --> 30:13.678
Maybe she just needs to eat
some grass or something.

30:13.778 --> 30:14.879
Really, Freddy?

30:14.979 --> 30:17.982
Well, that's what my dog does
when his stomach gets upset.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.388
- You don't look bad.
- I feel better.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.525
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I think it was just something I ate.

30:27.625 --> 30:33.080
- School cafeteria, I don't know.
- Yeah, looks like Friday's corn dogs.

30:33.564 --> 30:35.433
Let's get out of here.

30:35.933 --> 30:38.156
Why don't you shut up, Jason?

33:29.740 --> 33:32.194
Holy shit-hole.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.849
Alright, Jason, let's go.

33:37.949 --> 33:40.485
- For what?
- Because I said.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.587
I have something important to tell you.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.856
No, you don't, you're just gonna tell me
something dumb when we get in there.

33:45.956 --> 33:49.579
- Guys, just go.
- Yeah, go, Freddy.

33:53.231 --> 33:55.633
Get the fuck out of the car.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.220
Okay, God.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.998
Hey, how are you feeling?

34:09.981 --> 34:13.367
Better, just having some major cramps.

34:13.467 --> 34:17.474
- Are you starting?
- No, I already had it.

34:49.387 --> 34:51.641
Yeah, baby, choke me.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.676
Come on, baby.

34:57.628 --> 35:00.160
Go easy, baby, not so tight.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.827
That was hot.

35:20.951 --> 35:23.840
You never got kinky like that, baby.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.015
- Are you on the rag?
- Yeah, sorry.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.503
We've done it when I'm ragging before.

35:39.503 --> 35:41.354
Not with me.

36:04.028 --> 36:07.098
- What can I do you for?
- We'd like two rooms.

36:07.198 --> 36:10.668
King size it is. Smoker or non?

36:10.768 --> 36:14.655
- No, we'd like two rooms.
- Two rooms?

36:14.755 --> 36:17.241
Are you guys with another couple?

36:17.341 --> 36:19.343
No, they're for us.

36:19.443 --> 36:22.066
Well, you know those don't connect, right?

36:25.850 --> 36:27.804
We're not gay.

36:30.888 --> 36:33.691
Weren't you holding his dick on the way in?

36:33.791 --> 36:38.440
Because I don't like cleaning blood
off the sheets and shit off the ceilings.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.483
No, sir.

36:43.934 --> 36:47.156
Okay, two non-gay rooms.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.992
That'll be 69.35.

37:20.037 --> 37:23.107
Check-out is 11 a.m. You wanna lick my balls?

37:23.207 --> 37:25.576
- What?
- Do you wanna lick my balls?

37:25.676 --> 37:27.678
Excuse me, sir, one more time?

37:27.778 --> 37:31.582
I said do you want a wake-up call.

37:31.682 --> 37:34.136
Oh, no, we're good.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.624
You're all set. Those rooms are at
the end of the building on the left.

37:40.724 --> 37:42.653
Thank you.

37:42.753 --> 37:44.780
Oh, and guys?

37:45.363 --> 37:48.016
Enjoy your stay.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.419
Thanks.

37:56.574 --> 38:00.010
Hey, I know we got two beds, but why don't
you go ahead and sleep out in the car, buddy?

38:00.110 --> 38:02.113
What? No. I paid for one of those rooms.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.548
Come on, I'm just trying to get
some alone time with Carrie.

38:04.648 --> 38:09.253
No, man, forget that. Plus, dude,
she smells like corn dogs and throw up.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.622
Just gimme 10 minutes,
I'll wave you in when I'm done.

38:11.722 --> 38:15.459
- No, man, I'm tired.
- How about I break off your butt plug?

38:15.559 --> 38:18.448
Alright, fine, 10 minutes, Freddy.

38:36.013 --> 38:39.436
- We at the beach yet?
- No, we're stopping for the night.

38:47.892 --> 38:50.991
- Jason, what are you doing?
- I think he wants to jerk off or something.

38:51.091 --> 38:55.466
No, Freddy said I had to sleep in the car
so he could have sex with Carrie.

38:55.566 --> 38:58.836
- You fat fuck.
- You're unbelievable.

38:58.936 --> 39:01.258
You are such a dick, Freddy.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.957
Now see what you made me do?

39:20.057 --> 39:23.115
And if I see you step
one foot inside that room...

39:23.215 --> 39:26.282
...I will fuck you up.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.990
- Freddy!
- What, I'm not doing nothing.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.459
Babe, are you still upset
because of what fat-ass said?

39:55.559 --> 39:57.995
'Cause I'll kick his ass if you want me to.

39:58.095 --> 40:00.298
What, I will, for you.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.967
I'm not gonna let anyone disrespect my girl.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.502
Oh, come on, Freddy.

40:04.602 --> 40:07.538
No, I'm for real. You can't let
little punks like that get to you.

40:07.638 --> 40:10.307
Throughout your life you're gonna come across
people who constantly wanna knock you down...

40:10.407 --> 40:13.577
...because you're a good person.
I know, because I'm good people.

40:13.677 --> 40:16.292
Freddy, I'm not having sex with you.

40:17.092 --> 40:20.151
What sex?
That's the furthest thing from my mind.

40:21.051 --> 40:24.722
- Unless you want to.
- No, I don't feel well.

40:24.822 --> 40:27.792
- Babe, I got blue balls.
- Good, I hope they fall off.

40:27.892 --> 40:32.530
How can you say that? Our twins are in
there, Fredrick the second and Fredrina.

40:32.630 --> 40:36.867
I'm sick here.
Are you seriously still talking?

40:36.967 --> 40:40.571
There's no such thing as blue balls,
it's just something guys say to get laid.

40:40.671 --> 40:43.921
It's not just blue balls, the men in my
family have a long history of producing...

40:44.021 --> 40:47.678
...10 times the amount of testosterone
of the average Greek God or gorilla.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.015
We have to have sex every day,
preferably 10 times a day.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.950
Yeah, so you've told me.

40:53.050 --> 40:55.886
Then you know it could be leading
to explosive penis syndrome.

40:55.986 --> 40:57.688
Rumor has it the last Pope died from it.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.795
Freddy, if you don't get the fuck
out of my face with that shit...

41:00.895 --> 41:03.277
...you'll be lucky to get any this trip.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.790
Your fucking loss, bitch.

41:09.967 --> 41:12.571
- Can I at least jerk off on your ass?
- Get out!

41:26.784 --> 41:28.838
Fucking blue balls.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.413
You alright, boy?

41:39.513 --> 41:43.634
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just taking a leak.
Our bathrooms smells kinda funny.

41:43.734 --> 41:47.700
Well, you know if you shake it more
than three times, you're playing with it.

41:48.839 --> 41:52.811
Yeah, I've heard that. But I'm only
on the second shake, so I'm good.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.664
Okay.

42:08.225 --> 42:11.996
Yes, right there, right there.

42:12.096 --> 42:16.100
Carrie, come here, get on my left testicle.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.859
Clever girl, oh, just like that.

42:24.942 --> 42:27.030
Jason, get the fuck out.

42:29.379 --> 42:33.000
Carrie, oh, yeah.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.890
Goddamn charlie horse.

43:34.990 --> 43:36.480
Carrie!

43:36.580 --> 43:40.084
There's someone or something out there.

43:40.184 --> 43:42.438
I think she wanted my shoes.

43:43.420 --> 43:46.842
- Are you okay?
- Why?

43:48.125 --> 43:50.029
Do I not look okay?

43:51.361 --> 43:53.998
No, you... you look great.

43:54.098 --> 43:56.767
Your hair is pretty.

43:56.867 --> 43:59.970
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, what?

44:00.070 --> 44:03.238
I want you to fuck me as hard as you can.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.961
What?

44:13.483 --> 44:16.644
I want you to fuck me...

44:16.744 --> 44:20.463
...as hard as you can.

44:23.027 --> 44:24.880
Fuck it.

44:35.038 --> 44:37.509
Why are you smoking that in here?

44:38.709 --> 44:40.778
To get rid of the smell of sex.

44:40.878 --> 44:43.080
It doesn't smell like sex in here.

44:45.582 --> 44:47.435
Not yet.

44:48.518 --> 44:50.789
I'm not having sex with you.

44:51.889 --> 44:54.893
Aight, aight, aight, how 'bout...

44:55.743 --> 44:58.729
...a nice blow job for a big red apple?

44:58.829 --> 45:01.083
What? Ew, no.

45:03.633 --> 45:08.057
- So you'll do it for free, then?
- Are you stupid? We're not hooking up.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.829
Okay, Sherlock...

45:13.929 --> 45:18.982
...why do you think we are conveniently
here in the same room together?

45:19.082 --> 45:21.719
This was supposed to be me and Samara's room.

45:22.319 --> 45:24.087
And Samara invited me.

45:24.187 --> 45:27.758
And you and Samara aren't together anymore.

45:27.858 --> 45:29.913
That's why she ain't here.

45:35.032 --> 45:38.596
- <i>City was better the first time.</i>
- <i>But I hear Pat's, like shaking and shit.</i>

45:58.755 --> 46:00.625
Who are you texting?

46:01.225 --> 46:03.830
- Just one of my friends.
- Mm-hm.

46:04.694 --> 46:07.764
- Guy or girl?
- Girl.

46:08.264 --> 46:10.367
She's sending me pics of her new puppy.

46:10.467 --> 46:12.002
Oh, really?

46:12.102 --> 46:14.304
- Yeah.
- Lemme see.

46:14.404 --> 46:17.474
I had to delete it, my in-box was full.

46:21.311 --> 46:23.365
Are you being jealous?

46:26.116 --> 46:27.553
Fuck this.

46:28.986 --> 46:30.654
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:30.754 --> 46:34.758
When you say puppy,
do you really mean big fat dick?

46:35.158 --> 46:36.566
I don't even know what you're talking about.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.295
- Oh, really?
- Really.

46:38.395 --> 46:41.079
I saw the pictures on your phone, Pam.

46:41.799 --> 46:45.087
You went through my phone? How crazy are you?

46:47.755 --> 46:50.238
Not crazy enough to be with you.

46:52.642 --> 46:54.296
Fucker.

46:55.012 --> 46:59.683
Dirk, you better get back here, you pussy,
or I'm never gonna fuck you again.

46:59.783 --> 47:02.872
I've had better sex in boot camp.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.342
Dirk.

47:24.541 --> 47:27.978
Damn, boy, you like you're a fart away
from shitting yourself.

47:28.078 --> 47:30.948
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Everything all right with your room?

47:31.048 --> 47:35.937
Yeah, room's fine,
it's just the bitch that's in it.

47:39.423 --> 47:42.426
- Hey, dickbag.
- Excuse me?

47:42.526 --> 47:45.349
You got a bloody hitchhiker riding with you.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.766
Hold still while I flick it off.

48:01.011 --> 48:03.867
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

48:46.323 --> 48:48.610
- Fuck me.
- I am.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.669
- Fuck me!
- I am!

49:05.542 --> 49:07.195
Carrie?

49:08.278 --> 49:09.931
Carrie?

49:10.747 --> 49:12.400
Carrie?

49:20.590 --> 49:22.678
Oh, what the fuck?

49:30.267 --> 49:32.876
Oh, fuck!

49:52.055 --> 49:53.942
Oh, fuck.

49:57.895 --> 49:59.748
Oh, yeah.

50:07.004 --> 50:11.225
Right there, oh, this is awesome.

50:11.458 --> 50:13.062
Yeah.

50:18.448 --> 50:22.137
- I was wondering when you were gonna come to.
- Oh, what the fuck?

50:23.253 --> 50:26.731
That's a pretty nice goose egg
you got on your noggin.

50:27.324 --> 50:29.759
Why don't you put your peter
back in your pants?

50:29.859 --> 50:34.484
Follow your chicken-choking ass with me
and I'll have the missus fix you up.

50:36.299 --> 50:38.430
No, I'm alright, man.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.603
What the fuck?

50:55.752 --> 50:58.755
Carrie? What's up with the lights?

50:58.855 --> 51:00.408
Carrie?

51:00.557 --> 51:03.211
Oh, there you are.

51:03.426 --> 51:07.316
And you're naked. What a nice surprise.

51:08.231 --> 51:10.238
You been waiting for me?

51:11.234 --> 51:13.304
What can daddy do for you?

51:14.004 --> 51:17.607
I know. Freddy will fix you right up.

51:17.707 --> 51:19.560
Oh, yeah.

51:21.578 --> 51:24.238
I've been waiting for this all week.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.123
You're a little dry.

51:33.523 --> 51:36.185
I'm gonna be wetting you up with my tongue.

51:39.963 --> 51:44.053
You're a bit stinky tonight, baby...
but, I love it when you're stinky.

51:47.937 --> 51:52.694
Some of your dinner slipped down into your
lunchbox, babe, but I love peanuts, too.

51:59.917 --> 52:02.786
Man, your clit is so swollen
it's like two clits.

52:02.886 --> 52:04.739
And a banana.

52:09.326 --> 52:11.828
Let me get little Freddy in there...

52:11.928 --> 52:14.950
...I mean, big Freddy in there, now.

52:17.266 --> 52:19.737
You're a little extra tight, baby.

52:20.537 --> 52:22.390
Oh, yeah.

52:23.606 --> 52:26.628
Fuck. Ah, this feels good.

52:27.444 --> 52:29.059
Fuck.

52:31.948 --> 52:33.801
Oh, shit.

52:40.690 --> 52:42.509
Oh, shit.

52:45.228 --> 52:47.082
Oh, fuck.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.289
I'm gonna have to hit you up on the recharge.

53:03.947 --> 53:08.603
Brooklyn, I invited Samara, she invited you.

53:08.985 --> 53:13.623
You two aren't together anymore,
yet, you're here and she's not.

53:14.023 --> 53:16.479
Do you understand what I'm saying?

53:20.196 --> 53:23.751
So, what you're saying is...

53:24.701 --> 53:26.269
...I make you feel safe.

53:26.369 --> 53:29.306
What? Where would you get an idea like that?

53:29.406 --> 53:33.043
It's aight, it's aight,
I know what you meant.

53:33.743 --> 53:35.564
I'll protect you.

53:37.046 --> 53:38.867
You see these?

53:39.282 --> 53:41.718
These are considered deadly weapons.

53:42.118 --> 53:45.355
They are registered in all 65 states.

53:45.455 --> 53:48.425
I shouldn't even be wearing these right now.

53:48.525 --> 53:52.962
Why you think I had to move out
of Brooklyn? 'Cause I was banned.

53:53.062 --> 53:55.965
You wanna know what my warrior name was?

53:56.065 --> 53:59.287
Big Fat Dick Deadly Hands.

54:01.704 --> 54:05.361
I can't even jerk off
with these bad boys no more.

54:08.945 --> 54:10.680
I'm going for a walk.

54:10.880 --> 54:14.417
Cool, can you bring me back a sweet tea
and some Ginger Snaps?

54:14.517 --> 54:16.371
Yeah, sure.

54:40.243 --> 54:42.264
Oh, yeah, baby.

54:45.982 --> 54:48.871
Oh, you still got a good grip on me.

54:51.421 --> 54:53.990
Feels like someone's ready for round two.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.500
Oh, fuck. You like that, baby?

55:04.200 --> 55:06.203
Yeah, you do like that.

55:06.603 --> 55:08.256
Oh.

55:10.006 --> 55:12.409
Okay, I'm gonna go again.

55:12.609 --> 55:17.250
Oh, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

55:17.350 --> 55:18.895
Oh.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.041
Okay.

55:27.957 --> 55:29.526
Carrie?

55:29.626 --> 55:32.128
Come on. Come on, loosen up, Carrie.

55:32.228 --> 55:34.664
Come on, I can't pull it out.

55:34.764 --> 55:36.618
Carrie, come on.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.821
Come on, you gotta let go.

55:39.903 --> 55:41.471
Carrie?

55:41.571 --> 55:43.391
What the hell?

55:46.176 --> 55:48.445
Oh, what the fuck?

55:48.545 --> 55:51.448
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:51.548 --> 55:53.983
Fuck you, fat faggy fuck.

55:54.083 --> 55:56.504
Come on, come on.

55:57.520 --> 56:01.175
Get off me, you fat, fat fuck.

56:03.626 --> 56:07.530
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
get the fuck off me...

56:07.630 --> 56:10.066
...you fat, fat, fuck.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.902
Fuck, no, no, no, no, no, no.

56:13.002 --> 56:15.222
No, no, no.

56:46.069 --> 56:49.138
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

56:49.238 --> 56:51.074
Broke stranger with manners?

56:51.174 --> 56:54.918
I'm just trying to change
the rogue strangers are bad rep.

56:55.678 --> 56:57.881
I'm sorry, are you hitting on me?

56:57.981 --> 56:59.718
What?

56:59.818 --> 57:03.176
- You're Pamela's boyfriend, aren't you?
- I was.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.823
But I just found out
she's been cheating on me.

57:07.523 --> 57:09.158
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

57:09.258 --> 57:11.528
I feel like such an idiot.

57:11.628 --> 57:13.897
No, it's cool.

57:13.997 --> 57:15.884
Don't worry about it.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.936
Wait.

57:20.369 --> 57:22.173
I'm Christine.

57:23.139 --> 57:24.909
I'm Dirk.

57:25.374 --> 57:28.246
So are you headed to the beach, or...

57:29.579 --> 57:32.982
I was. Not so sure now, though.

57:33.379 --> 57:36.019
- You?
- Yeah, me and my BFF.

57:36.119 --> 57:37.922
That's cool.

57:40.123 --> 57:41.769
Um...

57:43.459 --> 57:45.261
...so you're in the Army, right?

57:45.361 --> 57:48.766
Yeah, I was, up 'til a couple weeks ago.

57:49.766 --> 57:52.302
It's a long story, bad ending.

57:52.402 --> 57:54.870
You're really on quite
the roll, aren't you, Dirk?

57:54.970 --> 57:56.773
Yeah, that's for sure.

57:57.373 --> 58:01.702
- You wanna talk about it?
- Mm, no, that's cool.

58:03.546 --> 58:05.550
I won't judge you.

58:08.755 --> 58:10.321
Okay.

58:13.489 --> 58:15.324
Were you overseas?

58:15.424 --> 58:17.387
No, local.

58:17.487 --> 58:20.830
I just got out of boot camp
and realized it wasn't really my thing.

58:20.930 --> 58:22.665
No?

58:22.765 --> 58:25.771
Na, that's more or less my dad's dream.

58:29.705 --> 58:34.043
Did you know, on average, 12 people a year
die from vending machines falling on them?

58:34.143 --> 58:36.913
Do vending machines
just randomly fall onto people?

58:37.013 --> 58:40.249
Oh, no. Most of the time,
people just get pissed.

58:40.349 --> 58:43.387
They lose their money
or their snack and they shake it.

58:44.387 --> 58:47.323
The other ones are random, though.
Like, fluke earthquakes.

58:47.423 --> 58:51.828
And why are you putting your vending
machine expertise on display for me?

58:51.928 --> 58:54.199
Are you trying to impress a girl?

58:56.132 --> 59:00.170
Well, dangerous vending machine,
dark motel...

59:00.270 --> 59:02.073
...late at night.

59:02.373 --> 59:04.874
Shouldn't you have your boyfriend
take care of this?

59:04.974 --> 59:07.977
- Well, I don't have a boyfriend.
- Oh, no?

59:08.077 --> 59:11.079
- No.
- Cool.

59:11.698 --> 59:15.118
- So you are hitting on me.
- What if I was?

59:15.218 --> 59:17.687
That depends. Are you a psychotic rapist?

59:17.787 --> 59:19.670
What if I was?

59:20.090 --> 59:23.426
I mean, no, no, I'm nothing like that at all.

59:23.526 --> 59:27.130
- I don't think you would tell me if you were.
- No, no, I'd say something.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.155
Psychotic rapists take a solemn oath.

59:33.702 --> 59:37.106
Well, Dirk, go ahead and hit on me.
See where it takes you.

59:37.206 --> 59:38.842
Alright.

59:39.292 --> 59:43.015
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

59:45.315 --> 59:48.987
Goddamn, you are one hefty motherfucker.

59:59.428 --> 01:00:02.073
What the fuck?

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.273
Get the fuck off me!

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:18.248
Get the fuck off.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.165
Lights out.

01:00:44.373 --> 01:00:47.179
This is the worst spring break, ever.

01:00:48.678 --> 01:00:51.614
So, after I graduate,
I'm gonna go to veterinarian school.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:55.118
- Oh, so you like animals?
- No, I hate them.

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:56.754
Duh.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.433
- My dad's a vet, too.
- Oh, your dad was in the war?

01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:02.547
Shut up, Dirk.

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:06.195
But, yeah,
I'm a bit of a daddy's little girl.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:09.232
Oh, well, I'm a bit of a daddy's girl, too.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.568
You are such a smart ass.

01:01:12.068 --> 01:01:14.771
Okay, okay, cut it out.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.109
No, me, I'm more of a momma's boy.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:21.711
What does your dad think
about you leaving the Army?

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:24.781
Well, he doesn't know I left.

01:01:24.881 --> 01:01:29.719
He thinks I graduated, he even bought me
a gun as a graduation present.

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:33.023
Just really haven't had
the heart to tell him I left.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:35.944
Well, I'm sure he'll understand.

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:43.333
So, are you a cat or dog person?

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.774
Well...

01:01:45.874 --> 01:01:50.155
...I love all animals, but since
you're so eager to categorize me...

01:01:50.255 --> 01:01:53.102
...I would have to say I'm a cat person.

01:01:53.202 --> 01:01:55.478
- Oh, lame.
- What?

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:59.749
No, you cat people, you're just weird.

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.179
- We are not.
- No?

01:02:02.279 --> 01:02:04.133
- No.
- No, really, you are.

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:07.606
Did you know, on average,
that 12 old ladies a year...

01:02:07.756 --> 01:02:11.595
...die by their cats? Eaten alive.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.797
- Here's the stats man again.
- No, really, I'm serious.

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:17.104
I'm not talking about the ones who just...

01:02:17.204 --> 01:02:19.714
...horde like 78 of them
in their single-wide trailer.

01:02:19.814 --> 01:02:22.805
Sometimes, it's the ones that
just have one or two of 'em.

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:25.741
They forget to feed 'em one night
and the the next thing you know...

01:02:25.841 --> 01:02:27.984
...bam! Kitten chow.

01:02:28.084 --> 01:02:30.659
And you cat people are notoriously violent.

01:02:30.759 --> 01:02:32.536
- No.
- Yes.

01:02:32.636 --> 01:02:36.152
And another thing, cats are just so dumb.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:40.156
Now dogs, that is a smart animal.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:41.878
Cats are way smarter than dogs.

01:02:41.978 --> 01:02:43.539
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:46.996
How many drug-sniffing cats
have you heard of?

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.899
12.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:52.601
- What was that?
- Sounded like it was Carrie.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:08.117
Carrie?

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:10.087
Stay with me.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:41.418
- Dirk!
- I'm sorry! It was a reaction.

01:03:41.838 --> 01:03:44.054
Fuck, run!

01:03:44.403 --> 01:03:46.040
Go!

01:03:50.759 --> 01:03:52.995
Get the keys, get the keys, get the keys.

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:56.259
- Quickly, go, go, go, go, go.
- Alright, alright, alright!

01:03:57.616 --> 01:03:59.053
Shit.

01:04:01.253 --> 01:04:03.759
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:09.582
Yo, zombie bitch.

01:04:18.387 --> 01:04:20.857
Carrie, what happened to you?

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:23.694
You were my BFF.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.195
Why? Why?

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:29.065
Something tells me
she's not your friend anymore.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.933
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.903
I don't think we
should stick around to find out.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.247
Dirk, Dirk!

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:04.900
No, no, no!

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:09.038
Get off!

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:43.172
Are you okay?

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.795
Yeah, I think so. Are you okay?

01:05:45.895 --> 01:05:49.580
No, what the hell is going on
and why wouldn't that guy just die?

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:52.109
I don't know.

01:05:52.881 --> 01:05:55.744
My God, I'm calling the police.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:05.028
Hi, yes, police?
You gotta send someone quick.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:08.531
My best friend just tried to kill me.

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:12.049
I think it's something she ate
or she's on her period.

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.450
The Redwood Motel.

01:06:26.999 --> 01:06:30.489
Christine. Yes, please, hurry.

01:06:32.821 --> 01:06:34.892
Have you seen my keys?

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:38.395
Oh, Carrie.

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.879
Come on, come to daddy.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:08.158
Oh, Carrie.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.427
What, no, no, no, no! No!

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.964
Dirk!

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.509
Carrie, please let go of me.

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.947
Carrie, please let go of me.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:30.174
Kick her in the vag.

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:42.009
- Are you okay?
- No!

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:44.014
Fuck.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.670
Go, go, go, go.

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:57.218
- Yo, shorty, where's my Ginger Snaps?
- Brooklyn...

01:09:57.318 --> 01:10:00.809
...I'm gonna need you
to listen to me very carefully.

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:05.067
Who the fuck invited John McClain?
And what's with the burner, John.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:08.937
It's for protection.
And you need to listen to your friend.

01:10:09.037 --> 01:10:11.974
Yo, only pussies carry guns.
You see these right here?

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.276
- Yo, you see these?
- Brooklyn!

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:16.928
Carrie's dead and she's trying to kill us.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.639
Who the fuck is Carrie?

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:24.096
She's still out there.

01:10:26.188 --> 01:10:28.891
- Are you guys for real?
- No bullshit.

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.862
Take a look for yourself.

01:10:46.608 --> 01:10:48.544
I don't see no dead bitch.

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:52.181
Fuck, fuck, oh, what the fuck?

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:54.950
- Get me out, get the fuck out.
- Hey, hey, relax!

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.353
We have to stay calm, alright?

01:10:57.453 --> 01:11:01.302
- And who the fuck are you?
- I'm the guy that's gonna save your ass.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.793
Call me Dirk.

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:07.798
What? Is this guy for real?

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:42.765
Hey, dispatch? What was the address
on that location, again?

01:11:43.138 --> 01:11:46.171
<i>713 Brandel Road, so roger that.</i>

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:51.407
Yeah, roger that, I'm on location.

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:54.112
I don't see any signs of disturbance.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:04.887
Come on, come on, little Freddy,
let's get out of here.

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:08.924
Yeah, I'm not gay, I'm not gay,
this could happen to anybody, right?

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:11.193
Oh, what am I gonna tell my priest?

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:13.129
Oh, fuck.

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:19.668
- Who is it?
- Police, open up.

01:12:20.258 --> 01:12:23.397
- Really?
- Yeah, really, open the door.

01:12:24.907 --> 01:12:26.675
Just a minute.

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:30.395
- Sir, open the door.
- Just one more second.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.150
Open the door, now.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.920
- Open the door, now!
- I'm kinda busy right now.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.689
If you'll leave your name,
your number at the tone...

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:43.525
...I'll be sure to get back to you
as soon as possible, beep.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:47.638
Sir, I'm gonna give you a count of three
and then I'm gonna kick the door in.

01:12:47.746 --> 01:12:50.488
- One. Two.
- Hold on, one minute.

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:53.870
Three!

01:12:56.204 --> 01:13:00.200
- What's going on in here?
- Nothing, man, we were just sleeping.

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:05.449
- Sir.
- Sir, he's dead tired.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.343
Why are you guys so close together?

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:22.565
Um, we just finished, you know.

01:13:30.736 --> 01:13:33.393
You guys from like California or something?

01:13:34.242 --> 01:13:38.114
No, we're just headed towards the beach
and we just stopped here for the night.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.949
Yeah, what happened to your head?

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:43.020
I got caught on a zipper?

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:50.359
Did you guys hear any other kind of noises
or anything? Like screams or something?

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:53.096
Besides us? No, not really.

01:13:53.859 --> 01:13:56.081
Well, how 'bout you keep it down, then, huh?

01:13:56.181 --> 01:13:58.618
Yes, sir, thank you.

01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:03.405
What was that?

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:07.075
Nothing, he's just having a bad dream.
Isn't that right, baby?

01:14:07.175 --> 01:14:09.650
Oh, come on, go to sleep.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:15.286
- You guys just be safe.
- You too, sir, have a good night.

01:14:20.822 --> 01:14:23.342
How could I think your balls were two clits?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.003
- Freeze!
- Thank God, officer.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.278
Why don't you put that gun down, right now.

01:14:36.378 --> 01:14:38.640
- Yo, he's Dirk.
- Quiet!

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.877
- Your gun, sir.
- Okay. I'm putting it down.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.614
We're the ones that called you, sir.

01:14:45.464 --> 01:14:48.179
- Nice and easy, here you go.
- Someone or something...

01:14:48.279 --> 01:14:51.527
- ...is trying to kill us.
- Back away slowly.

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.858
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

01:14:56.424 --> 01:15:01.129
- Why aren't you listening to us?
- Miss. Hands where I can see 'em.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:08.537
- Hey, Dispatch.
- Sir?

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.639
<i>Go for dispatch.</i>

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:15.227
Dispatch, yeah, I'm over at the motel and I
don't know what the hell's going on over here.

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.646
Yeah. Miss!

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:22.087
- Back up, stay vertical.
- Zombies is what's going on!

01:15:22.187 --> 01:15:27.556
You motherfucking prick. So tell them
to send for the fucking SWAT team...

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:30.159
- ...and bring your motherfucking Army.
- Christine?

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:34.870
And between all of those fucks,
tell them to pray for a fucking miracle...

01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:37.616
...that I don't shove a fireball up your ass!

01:15:37.716 --> 01:15:40.319
- Christine!
- What?

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:44.440
Young lady, do not move!

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.692
- Sir?
- Miss!

01:15:45.792 --> 01:15:47.409
- Sir?
- What?

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:49.381
Behind you.

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:55.462
What the fuck?

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.054
Yo, put that shit away.

01:15:59.154 --> 01:16:01.022
Hey, freeze!

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.632
I'm never jerking off again.

01:16:20.408 --> 01:16:23.012
Oh, what the fuck?

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.387
What the fuck, this sucks so bad.

01:16:30.769 --> 01:16:32.856
Worst spring break ever.

01:16:37.225 --> 01:16:39.961
Jason, what the fuck, dude?

01:16:40.061 --> 01:16:42.145
What the fuck? Stop.

01:16:43.331 --> 01:16:45.335
What the fuck?

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:47.204
No.

01:16:48.787 --> 01:16:52.241
Jason, what the fuck, man?

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:56.082
Jason, what the fuck are you doing, man?

01:16:56.182 --> 01:16:58.146
Jason, stop.

01:16:58.246 --> 01:17:01.149
Jason. No. Jason!

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:04.900
You will not go out that door.
No, I will not be seen like this.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.669
No! Stop it! You're not gonna make me gay!

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:15.116
No, Jason, stop! Stop!

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:20.972
Ah, I'm not gonna die like this.
I'm not gonna die like this.

01:17:39.438 --> 01:17:42.141

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.763

01:18:08.366 --> 01:18:10.783
Run! Run!

01:18:50.812 --> 01:18:52.628
Wake up!

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:54.931

You okay?

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.277
Yeah.

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:06.620
Thank you.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.661
You know, it's a good night for America.

01:22:09.761 --> 01:22:11.363
What?

01:23:40.388 --> 01:23:43.929
Now, I don't know what you kids

01:23:46.163 --> 01:23:48.039

01:23:58.199 --> 01:24:00.118
I feel you.

01:24:24.492 --> 01:24:27.095
You know what I could go for right now?

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:31.200
I could go for some fresh finger food.

01:24:34.802 --> 01:24:38.573
- How 'bout you, honey?
- One each!

01:24:38.673 --> 01:24:40.943
How about it, son?

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:04.000
What the hell?

01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:23.846
Shoot him in the brains!

01:25:28.623 --> 01:25:30.707
Shoot him in the other brain.

01:26:09.864 --> 01:26:10.992
Come on!

01:26:23.568 --> 01:26:26.582
Come on, gimme the keys, go!

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:41.929
Let's check the fuck out.

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:45.701
No! No! No!

01:26:48.048 --> 01:26:49.765

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.494

01:28:19.411 --> 01:28:21.880
I want penis.

01:28:23.130 --> 01:28:25.814
Penis in my butt.

01:28:25.914 --> 01:28:30.506
I want penis in my butt.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:44.620
Fucker!

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.327
I wanna go home.

01:29:25.926 --> 01:29:27.763
I'll drive.

01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:28.024
Hey, I just wanted to say thank you.

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:30.776
You're welcome.

01:30:31.175 --> 01:30:33.393
And, hey, thanks for, uh...

01:30:45.172 --> 01:30:48.575
- Oh, my God!
- What? What is it?

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:01.188
What did you do to me?

01:31:01.288 --> 01:31:04.058
I didn't know! I must be immune.

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.996
- Stay away from me!
- Christine!

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:11.138
- Christine!
- Stay away from me, you stay...

01:31:20.407 --> 01:31:23.458
Are you one a them? Are you one of them?

01:31:23.658 --> 01:31:25.314
No.

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:28.556
Oh, shit!

01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:38.411
Was she one of them?

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.028
She was pretty.

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:44.332
Yeah, she was.

01:31:44.432 --> 01:31:45.900
Where you headed?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:49.103
South. That's where my family is.

01:31:49.203 --> 01:31:51.572
We just came from south, man,
it's fucking chaos.

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:54.609
- Fuckers are everywhere.
- Is there anyone left?

01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:56.545
A few.

01:31:58.345 --> 01:32:00.515
- Where you going?
- South.

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:02.783
Didn't you hear what we just said?
Ain't nothing down there.

01:32:02.883 --> 01:32:04.986
I'll take my chances.

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:07.422
What exactly do you think you gonna do?

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:11.692
Earth just Googled hero,
and I came up number one.

01:32:11.992 --> 01:32:13.578
