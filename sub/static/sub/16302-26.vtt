No, this is way worse!

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
That was fictional.

-I can't stands no more! -Agreed!

-Super Teamwork Com-- -No!

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Both: Now what?!

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
The bad guys -- meaning you guys --

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
can't win against Broccoli Punch.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
It would be an abomination.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Black would be white, up would be down --

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
cats and dogs living together!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
-Mass hysteria! -Mmm.

Psst, come back up, Dorks for Hire --

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
we're slaying 'em!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So, ready for some more punishment, villain-tines?!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
You've got me green with anger!

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
That's not an expression at all! This guy's brilliant!

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Wow! Finally -- they like me!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
They really like me!

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
[ Bell dings ] Wow, Flonk, they

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
totally love your jokes.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Too bad they'll never know who's making 'em laugh, huh?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
What's that supposed to mean, Amateur-hyas!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm the one making 'em laugh! It's me that they love!

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Certainly, dear, but they just think you're Broccoli Punch!

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
How are they ever going to know the comedy genius

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
behind the mask?!

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
You're right! Time to reveal my secret identity!

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
[ All gasp ]

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Uh, what did the chicken say to the horse?!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
"Why the long face?"

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
[ Crowd booing ]

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Is this the greatest comedy fake-out of our generation?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Nothing short of genius! [ Laughing ]

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Wait, wait! I got more! Listen...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Sis, it's the famous actor behind Broccoli Punch --

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Brock Lee! -Indeed I am, young fan.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
This Flonk fellow has ruined the stage show

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
and harmed my fellow actors!

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Don't worry, Mr. Lee!

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Your Broccoli Punch costume is right here!

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
You can finish him off! -[ Chuckles ]

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
My boy, I'm merely an actor!

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm not meant for real combat,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
just brilliantly choreographed stage combat.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
We'll need an actual action hero!

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
I think he means someone else

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
should wear the costume, Prohyas.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Someone who can fight,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
but really, really understands Broccoli Punch!

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Okay, this was going swell, earlier.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Uh, a fish walks into a tavern, and --

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Larry.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
Why aren't you laughing?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Why aren't you little punks laughing anymore?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
That was funny!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000

Broccoli Fist!

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Let that be a lesson to you, Flonk!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Calling it comedy doesn't give you card white

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
to commit crime!

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
I hope you weren't trying to be funny.

Let me give you a little comedy schooling.

Listen to this one.

Why, I ask ya, why did the chicken,

To get to the other si--

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Because it was her civil liberty!

You may be cool, Prohyas,
