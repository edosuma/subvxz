WEBVTT

00:07.799 --> 00:09.885
-Bit of wildlife?
-Yes.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.178
-Have you fast-forwarded?
-Yeah.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.679
-No animals die?
-No.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.139
Okay, good.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.307
Gecko maybe.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.684
No, that's okay.
I can't really warm to geckos.

00:21.813 --> 00:22.814
What?

00:22.898 --> 00:25.984
I just feel sorry for fish.
They always look so cold.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.445
I mean, it's no life, is it?

00:30.155 --> 00:32.241
What's it like having empathy
for every single thing?

00:32.323 --> 00:34.993
Oh, God, Jason,
it is absolutely exhausting.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.828
I can't even look at elephants anymore.

00:39.748 --> 00:40.749
Who's that?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.835
-It's Penny.
-What'd she say?

00:42.918 --> 00:45.462
She's gonna pop by tomorrow.
She's got some news.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.007
-She didn't say what?
-No.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.802
Hello, Mum. You all right?

00:51.885 --> 00:54.346
He won't try anything new,
so I'm going on my own.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.474
Spain, Jason, Spain!
She's gonna get herself killed!

00:57.558 --> 01:00.352
It's a walking holiday in Alicante, Dad.
No one's getting killed.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.272
I wanna have experiences!
I wanna live an impulsive life!

01:04.772 --> 01:07.609
I wanna eat a bull's testicle
and flamenco!

01:07.693 --> 01:09.611
-Your mum's gone mad, Jason.
-Bull's testicle?

01:09.695 --> 01:11.321
-Don't know.
-Did I tell you about vanilla essence?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.698
For God's sake.

01:13.824 --> 01:18.245
There's vanilla essence in the cupboard.
Nine years old, barely used.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.748
If I bake at the current rate,
I'll die before it's empty.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.793
Outlived by vanilla essence!

01:26.628 --> 01:27.838
Okay, fine!

01:28.463 --> 01:31.133
I'm happy to consider more decking
in the back garden!

01:31.842 --> 01:34.720
Not decking, Vic. I'm sick of decking.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.139
You can't keep throwing decking
at the problem.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.309
And she's gone.

01:41.059 --> 01:44.021
You know, it won't kill us
to be a bit more impulsive.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.695
You are so stupid.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.047
Yeah, you just pick up the car
outside terminal 4.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.593
Yeah, no, I know. I get confused
in arrivals and departures too.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.970
'Cause, you know,
I'm arriving at the airport.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.808
Thanks.
I think you're a really unique person too.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.436
Okay, bye. Enjoy your car.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.523
-Hey. You know Richard's leaving?
-Really?

02:29.024 --> 02:30.776
Are you gonna go for his job?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.946
Jen.
They're never gonna let me be a manager.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.697
Why do you think they're better than us?

02:35.781 --> 02:39.409
All right, Richard drives a Volvo estate.
They're not astronauts.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.912
Honestly. It's not for me.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.459
Hello. Thanks for waiting.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.712
Yeah, you were just in a queue, so...

02:51.797 --> 02:55.050
Right, I mean,
I think if you hate queues this much,

02:55.133 --> 02:56.844
cars may not be for you.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.703
-Hi, Raina.
-Hi.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.454
-Who's that?
-My auntie.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.497
Hey, guys. How are you?

03:25.581 --> 03:27.499
So is your dad not picking you up anymore?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.750
No.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.921
-Maybe drop-offs?
-No, he has a new job.

03:33.005 --> 03:35.716
Well, sometimes daddies have to work.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.095
It doesn't mean he doesn't love us.
I mean, you.

03:40.179 --> 03:42.431
Doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.226
Okay, okay, off you go.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.728
Auntie Sashi!

03:48.562 --> 03:49.563
Hey.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.481
Say bye.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.692
Bye.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.831
Jason?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.752
Your bathroom needed retiling.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.755
Okay.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.216
Thank you.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.888
-Hiya.
-Jase.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.765
-What?
-Why is your dad retiling our bathroom?

04:24.848 --> 04:26.642
-Is he okay?
-Listen, don't rock the boat.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.853
Those are the sorts of questions we can
get into once we have a retiled bathroom.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.564
Oh, no, I'm nervous.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.774
I know, I know.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.693
-Okay, all right. I'm gonna get that.
-Okay, yeah.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.244
Hello, Penny.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.954
-Do you want to come in?
-Yes, please.

04:51.542 --> 04:55.379
Your carpet trim needs doing now.
I'm never getting away!

04:55.462 --> 04:57.130
Sorry. My mum's away. I think he's lonely.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.215
Yeah.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.552
So, what's going on?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
Right, we don't have much time.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.098
Can I be blunt? Don't answer that.
We don't have the time.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.391
I'm going to be blunt.

05:07.474 --> 05:11.895
The local authority are now considering
another family for Princess.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.358
Why?

05:17.484 --> 05:20.988
Well, an opportunity has arisen to place
Princess and her brother together,

05:21.071 --> 05:24.116
and they would love to keep these children
together if at all possible.

05:24.199 --> 05:28.620
And, look, I know it's hard,
but I would urge you, if you can,

05:28.704 --> 05:31.790
to look inside yourselves and summon
the courage to see this as good news,

05:31.874 --> 05:35.169
because it-- it is, for them.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.338
I mean, it's not-- It's not hard, is it?
I mean, we saw 'em together.

05:38.422 --> 05:42.259
-It's not-- It's not hard, but...
-I mean, it's a bit hard.

05:43.802 --> 05:44.803
I know.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.309
Could we not take them both?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.770
Taking two children,
that's a mammoth undertaking.

05:53.854 --> 05:58.025
And I should know. I have brought up two
happy, friendly, well-adjusted children...

05:58.108 --> 05:59.109
out of four.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.320
We could do it. I know we could.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.779
Not to mention
there's a question of space.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.782
We have space. Penny!
We have-- We have space.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.285
-Do we?
-Yeah, absolutely.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.997
I mean, Penny, it's bigger than it looks.
It's just-- It's just messy.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.124
They usually require each child
to have their own room.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.169
-Jason, help me pick some of this up.
-What's under there? A third bedroom?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.921
Maybe they could sleep in our bed.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.380
We could have the sofa.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.049
-We sleep on the sofa quite a lot.
-See?

06:22.132 --> 06:26.220
As convincing as all these plans sound,
listen, we have to let this play out.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.721
This is a process.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.516
Ebb and flow,
and we are in the ebbiest of ebbs.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.851
You must just stay strong.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.438
Lean on each other, and I will call
as soon as we know the decision.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.732
Is there anyone who can support you
over the next few weeks?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.526
Someone who'd understand?

06:41.026 --> 06:43.946
-Where's your angle driver?
-I haven't got an angle driver.

06:44.488 --> 06:46.240
How can you not have an angle driver?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.158
I suppose I can make do
with your diamond core drill.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.785
I haven't got one of those either.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.913
You're not using an SDS drill
for masonry work, are ya?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.289
Who do you think I am, Dad?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.959
Sorry. Vic, can you--
Can you give us a minute, please?

06:58.377 --> 06:59.503
What's the matter?

06:59.586 --> 07:02.381
They found someone that can take
both Princess and her brother.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.467
-Why don't you take 'em?
-Each child has to have their own room.

07:05.551 --> 07:08.011
Why? I never did. Never have.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.597
I had a brother, and then I got married.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.850
What's rooms got to do with it?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.185
The queen's got hundreds of rooms.
Look at her kids.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.271
-All simpletons and perverts.
-Dad, can we have a minute?

07:17.354 --> 07:20.524
-Thick as mince, the lot of 'em.
-Please, Dad. Just... Thank you.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.279
Would he be spending a lot of time
with the children, or...

07:25.362 --> 07:27.114
Not unsupervised, no. No.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.785
No,
it's good that they get to stay together.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.371
We want what's best for them.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.455
-Don't we?
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.916
I will call you
as soon as we know the decision.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.376
Thanks, Penny.

07:41.420 --> 07:44.047
Can we just give them a bit of space?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.303
It's all right. It's all right. Hey.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.763
Come on.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.515
We just keep going.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.268
-All right? We just keep going.
-I'm so tired.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.772
So, why aren't you in Spain, then?

08:02.941 --> 08:04.484
Not for me.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.199
Okay.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.166
-She doesn't want me there.
-Did she invite you?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.713
She's changed a bit.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.133
Yeah, they do that, people.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.638
She wants to dance the flamenco.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.390
Can you see me doing that?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.602
Now you listen to me.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.524
All I had to show for being 60
was an addiction to antique gravy boats,

08:43.607 --> 08:45.526
a husband gayer than Adele's entourage

08:45.609 --> 08:47.694
and a sharp, shooting pain
when I look to the left.

08:47.778 --> 08:51.323
Four years later, I have slept with
two members of the shadow cabinet,

08:51.406 --> 08:52.574
and I'm not done yet.

08:52.658 --> 08:54.159
Had cancer, beaten cancer,

08:54.243 --> 08:57.454
regained full neck rotation,
learned Korean...

08:59.081 --> 09:01.083
and saved over 30 kids from at-risk homes

09:01.166 --> 09:04.086
because I am the best bloody
child and families social worker

09:04.169 --> 09:05.921
in North East London.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.633
No one's laminated my life story yet,
nor yours.

09:10.801 --> 09:14.388
The next time I see you,
you'd better have something pierced.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.348
Either that
or a shirt with some color in it.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.563
-Okay.
-Oh, my goodness!

09:22.646 --> 09:25.524
What is the one thing that we need
to be able to take these kids?

09:25.607 --> 09:30.445
Money, experience, preparation,
approval from social services--

09:30.529 --> 09:31.780
Exactly. Another bedroom.

09:31.864 --> 09:34.700
So, why don't we just rent somewhere
with three bedrooms?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.243
-With whose money, Nik?
-Mine.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.288
There's a management position
opening at work. I'm gonna go for it.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.914
I thought you said
you were happy where you were.

09:40.998 --> 09:43.917
Nope. It's time to make a move.
I need to take control of my life,

09:44.001 --> 09:46.712
and I need to stop relying
on other people all of the time.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.048
-Can I borrow your laptop?
-Go on then.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.718
"Operation Rent A Bigger Flat"
starts here.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.471
You know you don't call the operation
the actual thing you're doing.

09:56.555 --> 09:57.556
What?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.017
Well, it needs a code name.
Otherwise, what's the point?

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
-What you talking about?
-Operation Valkyrie wasn't called,

10:02.352 --> 10:04.479
"Operation
Let's Secretly Kill Adolf Hitler," was it?

10:04.563 --> 10:07.399
Oh, God, Jase. You're really taking
all the fun out of this, aren't you?

10:11.904 --> 10:14.198
Bloody hell. Three grand a month?

10:31.757 --> 10:34.092
Oh, my God.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.344
I hit rock bottom, Nikki.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.971
I got so drunk on Monday,

10:38.055 --> 10:40.098
I went home with a zone five.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.228
It has got to stop.
I am not yet the best I can be.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.396
-Your hair is amazing.
-Thanks, I needed it.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.065
I was carrying a lot of trauma
in my fringe.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.318
Also, I decided...

10:51.401 --> 10:53.237
I'm going for the promotion.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.697
Okay.

10:55.781 --> 10:59.034
I cannot still be sat here answering
phones in this job in my 30s, Nikki.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.702
-I'd kill myself.
-Yeah.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.287
And management get flexi-hours.

11:02.371 --> 11:04.915
I could finally get out of this crazy
ten-to-four grind.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.751
Jen, you know they're not the hours
that we're actually supposed to--

11:07.835 --> 11:09.795
Plus, I forgot my phone yesterday.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.630
So I had to work, and you know what?

11:11.713 --> 11:13.382
I didn't totally hate it.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.175
I thought
if you're not going for it, then--

11:15.259 --> 11:16.468
Okay, yeah.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.054
The thing is, I...

11:19.137 --> 11:21.557
I actually thought
that I might go for it too.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.226
-Really?
-Yeah, is that okay?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.103
Oh, my God, of course!

11:26.186 --> 11:29.147
Turns out we need a bigger flat or
we're not gonna get the kids that we want.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.941
Also, you get a personal laptop.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.986
So you can look at porn
without having to disable the IP address.

11:35.153 --> 11:36.780
Yeah, and there's that.

11:39.825 --> 11:43.036
Hello. Vista Car Rental,
Jennifer speaking. How may I help you?

11:44.454 --> 11:47.499
Thanks for coming in at short notice.

11:47.583 --> 11:52.087
I just think
we have a real talent on our hands.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.840
What is it? A hippo?

11:55.507 --> 11:56.508
No, it's a house.

12:00.679 --> 12:03.932
Okay. Okay.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.353
So is this all you wanted?

12:08.437 --> 12:11.064
I mean, I left work early, so--

12:11.148 --> 12:15.152
Well, the school doesn't see
this kind of talent very often.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.155
I mean,
we did have a county shot-putter once,

12:18.238 --> 12:22.409
but that was largely a thyroid issue,
and she left under a cloud anyway, so.

12:24.161 --> 12:28.165
No, I mean, this is a fish she's done.

12:29.499 --> 12:33.670
She's got real movement in the hair.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.841
Isn't that where she just leant on it?

12:37.925 --> 12:40.260
And all the teachers love her.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.848
Mainly because she doesn't really
say much, but that's a gift in itself.

12:45.724 --> 12:49.269
And...
her face is always spotless after lunch.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.233
Well, she's obviously a talent.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.487
Maybe we should meet up
and put a plan together.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.406
For the talent nurturing.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.284
Sure. Yes.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.162
Drink tomorrow?

13:07.246 --> 13:09.248
We can meet
at The Camden Assembly at 6:00.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.832
Right, okay. Yes.

13:12.251 --> 13:15.212
-See you there.
-See you there.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.008
Thank you.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.681
Even if you get your new promotion,
we can't afford any of these. Look.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.558
Can you not look further out of London?

13:27.641 --> 13:29.226
I've gone down as far as Brighton.
Nothing.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.061
-Well, go further.
-Well, you can't.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.145
Why?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.398
'Cause that's the sea.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.649
Then France.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.026
Then it starts getting
more expensive again.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.905
How's your Albanian?

14:07.681 --> 14:08.682
Hello, Vic.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.601
Socket needed rewiring.

14:10.684 --> 14:14.021
Right.
I thought Jason said he'd fixed that.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.398
We have different standards.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.694
New shirt?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.112
Yeah.

14:22.196 --> 14:25.824
Very nice. Snazzy.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.576
Got my job interview today.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.496
They got rid of lever arch files,
and the world went to shit.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.582
Yeah.

14:34.583 --> 14:37.419
-Sorry about that.
-Not your fault.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.298
Right. Have a nice day.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.805
Oh, my God. He's here. Again.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.558
He's got a couple of things
to take care of, then he's gonna go.

14:51.642 --> 14:53.519
-He won't be long.
-He's left stuff in the freezer.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.229
And tins. Look.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.024
Oh, my God.
What is happening to this flat?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.318
Where are my keys?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.572
Oh, good luck with
"Operation Nikki Gets a Promotion Day."

15:05.656 --> 15:07.783
-See? It's clearer, isn't it?
-Oh, God, yeah.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.744
Don't forget we've got a viewing
on that Mayfield Street place at 6:00.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.704
-Okay. It's definitely three bedrooms?
-Yeah.

15:12.788 --> 15:15.082
-How is that in our budget?
-Dunno. Maybe it's a murder house.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.460
Fine. It'll have been deep cleaned then,
won't it? Okay.

15:18.877 --> 15:19.962
-I love you.
-I love you.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.255
Listen, good luck, all right?

15:22.047 --> 15:23.048
You're gonna be great.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.384
-Bye, Vic.
-See ya.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.976
All right, I'm gonna finish this,
then shoot off.

15:34.059 --> 15:37.104
-All right.
-I've got other things to do, you know?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.523
You know you can just pop over
and say hello, you know?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.441
And have a chat. You haven't--

15:41.525 --> 15:42.526
What about?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.529
Well, I don't know. General chat.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.786
-You all right, then?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.917
-You?
-Yeah. Yeah.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.220
Actually, would you mind
having a look at the toaster?

16:10.304 --> 16:12.639
-It's not catching or something.
-That'll be a latch release.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.143
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah. Probably.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.107
-You heard from your mum then?
-No.

16:22.191 --> 16:23.317
She's only been gone, what, two--

16:23.400 --> 16:25.277
-Nearly three days.
-Okay.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.279
Why don't you give her a call?

16:28.447 --> 16:31.825
Nah. It's been a blessing, the quiet.

16:36.079 --> 16:38.790
-All right. I'll leave you to it.
-She says she regrets her life.

16:42.002 --> 16:43.754
But I've been her whole life.

16:44.922 --> 16:47.174
I don't think she regrets
the things that she's done.

16:47.257 --> 16:50.385
I think that she regrets the things
that she hasn't done. You know?

16:50.969 --> 16:53.514
It's about adding things, innit?
Not taking away, you know?

16:53.597 --> 16:57.309
I think-- I think you need to--
you need someone who adds things.

16:57.392 --> 16:58.435
-Do I?
-Yeah.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.231
Yeah. I think-- I think it's good for you.
I think it helps you grow and all that.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.526
It's fun, innit, you know?

17:05.608 --> 17:08.569
Watching someone grow. Change.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.657
'Cause you never know
what they're gonna turn into.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.079
All right then, mate.

17:24.752 --> 17:29.633
I started here five years ago
as a lowly customer service assistant.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.469
You're still a customer service assistant.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.179
That's correct.

17:34.263 --> 17:38.267
And that gives me a unique insight.
Let me give you an example.

17:39.226 --> 17:42.521
Who do we rent cars to? Drivers.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.567
What do drivers want? Cars.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.654
And what do they not have
when they call us? Cars.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.490
So how are they getting here?

17:53.949 --> 17:56.994
Do you know how many people
have decided not to hire a car with us

17:57.077 --> 18:01.290
when I've told them we don't pick them up
or drop them off? Loads.

18:01.373 --> 18:05.210
So much business, lost.
Literally thousands of pounds.

18:05.294 --> 18:10.090
-So, the first thing that I would do if--
-Wait. We do pick customers up.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.844
-What?
-We offer pickups and drop-offs.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.513
We rolled that out about 18 months ago.
Have you...

18:18.098 --> 18:20.225
Have you not been telling people
that we do that?

18:32.905 --> 18:33.989
How'd it go?

18:34.072 --> 18:36.909
-Really well.
-Yay.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.536
It was tough,
but I managed to convince them.

18:39.620 --> 18:40.871
What, to give you the job?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.581
No, to keep my current one.

18:43.624 --> 18:44.958
It was touch and go for a while.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.337
I think my luck is changing.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.298
This could be the start
of something really good for me.

18:52.758 --> 18:56.303
Hello. Vista Car Rental, Jen speaking.
How may I help you?

19:12.402 --> 19:16.657
All right, let's start. This is Lucy from
the Reading branch, and Debbie's from HR.

19:16.740 --> 19:18.992
She has to be here
because of Weinstein and that.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.329
We'll just let you
make yourself comfortable.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.830
She's fine. We're all fine.

19:23.914 --> 19:27.751
Okay. Why don't you start by telling us
why you'd like a move into management?

19:27.835 --> 19:32.756
Yes. Well, as a customer sales executive,

19:32.840 --> 19:35.050
I have extensive sales experience,

19:35.133 --> 19:37.219
an intimate knowledge of the business,

19:37.302 --> 19:39.596
a good relationship with existing clients.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.932
I work well as a team,

19:42.015 --> 19:46.103
but you know, also as an individual.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.065
Sorry.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.945
Oh, my God.
No, I don't know what I'm talking about.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.534
I-- I hate all that. I'm just--

20:00.617 --> 20:02.452
I'm just gonna talk normally.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.331
I'm not a customer sales executive.
I work on the phones.

20:06.415 --> 20:07.749
There's nothing wrong with that,

20:07.833 --> 20:10.919
but I've--
I've got some really good ideas, Terry.

20:11.003 --> 20:13.422
And no, I-- I've not much
management experience,

20:13.505 --> 20:16.967
but Richard has an MBA, and his
computer's been on for five straight years

20:17.050 --> 20:18.760
because
he doesn't know how to log back in. So...

20:18.844 --> 20:21.388
You know, I mean, where has that got you?

20:21.972 --> 20:24.850
Right. First, we've got to--

20:25.601 --> 20:27.644
We've got to change the hall music, Terry.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.521
Everyone's complaining about it.

20:29.605 --> 20:32.191
Why don't we provide car seats
for children

20:32.274 --> 20:34.359
and do pickups on a Sunday evening?

20:36.361 --> 20:40.282
Stop being horrible to our customers.
Just let scratches go.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.701
Stop cheating people on the extra cover.

20:42.784 --> 20:47.623
And do not--
Do not launch a promotion on a Monday,

20:47.706 --> 20:50.709
'cause half the sales are 23,
and they're off with hangovers.

20:50.792 --> 20:51.960
You don't know stuff like this

20:52.044 --> 20:54.213
unless you've been out there
for eight years, Terry.

20:54.296 --> 20:56.590
What's your view
on the sustainability report?

20:56.673 --> 20:58.008
Have you got the...

20:59.384 --> 21:01.637
-Where's the...
-It's in the shared folder on the G drive.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.222
What?

21:03.931 --> 21:06.058
-On the desktop.
-Right.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.354
-No. On your computer.
-Jeez.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.483
God. They got rid of lever arch files,
and the world went to shit.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.861
-Yes. Thank you.
-Yeah.

21:22.991 --> 21:24.493
Did they say when you might hear?

21:24.576 --> 21:27.871
Ages. Honestly, Jase,
I'm just glad I didn't embarrass myself.

21:28.539 --> 21:30.374
It's not very "us" around here,
is it, Nik?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.751
I mean, it's a bit coconut latte-ey.

21:33.252 --> 21:36.129
I looked it up,
and no one's been stabbed here since 2016.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.924
I mean, that's just weird.
You want a stabbin' every six months.

21:39.007 --> 21:40.676
Otherwise, the house prices spiral.

21:40.759 --> 21:43.929
No, I love it. Camden's so grubby.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.931
I'd love our kids
to be able to walk to school

21:46.014 --> 21:48.642
without being offered weed
or knockoff trainers.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.310
-You talking about Sneaky Steve?
-Yes.

21:50.394 --> 21:53.146
That guy's a legend. He can get you
literally any shoe you want.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.649
Yeah, but where is he getting them from?
That's my question.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.776
'Cause they're not new.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.903
My Reebok Classic had a sock in it.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.323
And our flat's literally falling apart.

22:03.407 --> 22:05.033
-God, it is nice, isn't it?
-Yeah.

22:12.708 --> 22:13.834
-Hello, mate.
-Hello.

22:13.917 --> 22:14.918
-Hello.
-Nikki.

22:15.002 --> 22:16.628
-Yes, Nikki. Yes.
-Jason. What's your name?

22:16.712 --> 22:18.088
-Toby.
-Hello, Toby. How are ya?

22:31.685 --> 22:33.437
-Hello.
-Hiya.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.649
-I-- I'm not coming.
-What?

22:38.275 --> 22:40.611
-I'm not coming.
-But you're here.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.113
Yeah. But just to tell you I'm not coming.

22:43.697 --> 22:46.658
-Okay.
-I'm here physically but not morally.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.619
Okay.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.580
Because we're not gonna talk about Raina,
are we?

22:51.663 --> 22:53.123
I mean, we both know.

22:53.874 --> 22:56.001
I've spoken 50 words to you.

22:57.127 --> 23:00.130
I don't even know you.
I don't even know why I'm here.

23:00.214 --> 23:01.465
Well, I didn't think you were.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.843
And they were nice words.

23:07.012 --> 23:08.680
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

23:09.348 --> 23:10.849
-Okay.
-Okay.

23:12.476 --> 23:13.810
See you.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.065
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.620
-So, where are you guys?
-Camden.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.664
-Camden way, yeah.
-Yeah. It's nice, but, you know.

23:33.747 --> 23:37.376
Yeah. I mean, it's supposed to be
up-and-coming, isn't it?

23:37.459 --> 23:40.796
But there's still only one bank
and about 12 places to buy a bong.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.381
Right, yeah.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.384
This is lovely.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.468
Wow.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.929
As you can see,
nearly an en-suite, which is good.

23:49.012 --> 23:52.474
And good storage.
And the garden's south-facing.

23:52.558 --> 23:54.476
Oh, wow.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.353
Do you guys have a garden yourselves?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.897
No, no. We did have a window box, though.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.899
But it got away from us.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.818
Okay.
I'll let you guys have a look around.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.403
-All right, mate.
-Make yourselves at home.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.154
-Nice one. Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.868
Oh, my God.

24:16.832 --> 24:18.292
Bloody hell.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.674
-We love it.
-It sounds terrific, doesn't it?

24:25.757 --> 24:28.635
Amazing. Well,
we're looking to move out as soon as.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.513
-So, I'll let the estate agent know.
-All right. Fantastic.

24:31.597 --> 24:32.764
Perfect. You can meet the others.

24:32.848 --> 24:34.266
-The others?
-What you mean?

24:34.349 --> 24:35.517
-Yo.
-Hey, how you?

24:35.601 --> 24:36.602
-Hello. Hi.
-You all right?

24:36.685 --> 24:39.354
This is Nikki and Jason.
They are taking the room.

24:39.438 --> 24:40.439
The room?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.900
Yay! Yes, come. Come live with us.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.193
-It's really nice.
-"The room."

24:44.276 --> 24:45.819
Apart from the lock on the downstairs
bathroom doesn't work.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.070
I didn't know it was just a room.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.780
So you just have to sing
while you're in there.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.618
-Cheers, mate. We'll be in touch.
-Yeah.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.369
-Thank you.
-Yeah, speak soon.

24:54.453 --> 24:56.121
-Yeah, bye.
-Yeah, lovely. See ya.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.749
Why didn't you read the whole advert?

24:58.832 --> 25:00.876
I saw the word "beautiful"
and jumped straight to the pictures.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.294
Just like everyone else does.

25:02.753 --> 25:06.465
Toby. I mean, what sort of name is Toby?
Of all the names you could pick. Toby?

25:06.548 --> 25:08.509
-I stole a guava.
-What? Why?

25:08.592 --> 25:10.886
-Because he slagged off Camden.
-You slagged off Camden.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.388
Yes, I'm allowed to slag off Camden.
It's where I live.

25:13.472 --> 25:14.890
Okay.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.480
-Need any gear, guys?
-No, thanks.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.023
But thank you for asking.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.691
All right, guys. Fancy new trainers?

25:24.775 --> 25:26.109
Read the room, Steve.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.194
Any gear, guys?

25:29.154 --> 25:31.657
Yes, bro. Yeah, new kicks, new kicks.

25:44.545 --> 25:46.004
It's not the same, is it?

25:46.088 --> 25:47.089
No.

25:48.173 --> 25:49.383
It's better.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.677
It's a home.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.033
Jason?

26:20.205 --> 26:23.625
Oh, my-- What?

26:27.421 --> 26:30.716
-What-- What's he gone and done?
-He's made a third bedroom.

26:32.301 --> 26:34.720
Jason, this is unbelievable.

26:36.346 --> 26:37.556
-Look. Nikki, Nikki, look.
-Yeah?

26:37.639 --> 26:40.142
He's got some little handles
for their little hands.

26:40.225 --> 26:41.518
Stop it.

26:43.395 --> 26:45.564
This is the maddest...

26:46.398 --> 26:48.650
and the sweetest thing.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.779
-Is it even possible?
-Well, I dunno.

26:54.198 --> 26:57.284
It's a three-bedroom flat. Kind of.

26:58.619 --> 27:01.371
-What's the landlord gonna have to--
-Let's not, let's not.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.333
Let's just enjoy it for tonight, Jase.

27:07.419 --> 27:08.504
My God.
