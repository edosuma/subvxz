WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.171
Previously, on 90210...
I'm done dating.

00:04.212 --> 00:06.131
I mean it, Silver.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.550
I like you more than
I've ever liked anyone.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.136
This is my
sister Savannah,

00:11.178 --> 00:12.387
back from boarding school.
This is Dixon.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.597
Nice to meet you.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.682
The guy's a huge player, right?

00:14.723 --> 00:15.975
Yeah.

00:16.015 --> 00:16.934
I don't think

00:16.976 --> 00:18.686
me and Silver are over yet.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.979
We're talking about
getting back together again.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.313
Got a text from Ivy saying

00:21.355 --> 00:22.356
I had to come over here,
that you

00:22.397 --> 00:23.357
had something
you wanted to tell me.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.651
(both panting)

00:25.693 --> 00:28.153
I think it's time for me
to see my birth mom.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.488
I know this guy's
a drug dealer.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.615
I've been buying from Jasper
for the last month.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.158
You're a drug dealer.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.702
And you accidentally
ran over my uncle.

00:34.743 --> 00:35.995
Apparently, they're doing

00:36.036 --> 00:37.287
random locker searches,

00:37.329 --> 00:38.664
something to do with drugs.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.498
Navid.

00:39.540 --> 00:40.791
Come on.

00:40.833 --> 00:41.750
Let's go.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.008
Wow, this has been
a productive afternoon.
Yeah.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.968
I'm so sorry.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.928
Keep your eyes
on the road there, partner.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.638
Any word from Navid?

00:54.680 --> 00:56.765
No, and if I leave him
any more messages,

00:56.807 --> 00:58.017
I'm gonna seem
stalker-ish.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.394
You know, there's no way
that that coke was his.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.562
We're talking about Navid here.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.438
I can't believe
he got suspended

01:03.480 --> 01:05.232
when he's so
clearly innocent.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.734
It's a travesty
of justice.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.235
At least
he wasn't expelled.

01:08.276 --> 01:09.570
Or expunged.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.906
Oh, my God, what's that,
like, death by sponge?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.532
Yep, exactly.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.367
You know, I bet his parents
confiscated his phone

01:15.409 --> 01:17.369
and his computer,
and he has no idea

01:17.411 --> 01:19.246
that I'm trying
to reach out to him.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.831
(groans)
I feel so helpless.
Hey,

01:20.873 --> 01:21.790
he's gonna be okay.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.376
Hey! Annie!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.045
Oh, hey, guys.

01:26.085 --> 01:27.880
Looks like you've been doing
some serious shopping.

01:27.922 --> 01:28.923
Yes.

01:28.964 --> 01:29.965
One of us has.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.550
You should actually
come with us.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.053
We have about 20 minutes left
before the shops close,

01:34.093 --> 01:36.764
and I am still looking
for the perfect LGD.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.265
Little Gold Dress.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.892
(laughs):
Ah, of course.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.518
Well, I-I would love to...

01:41.560 --> 01:42.937
Come on.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.731
Uh, yeah, well, um,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.190
sorry, I can't.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.609
So I'll see you later.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.864
O-kay.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.240
See you later, Annie.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.451
Bye, Annie.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.416
You hungry?
Not really.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.251
Okay, come on, Annie,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.586
you said that you
would give me a chance.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.006
What-what do you mean?

02:11.048 --> 02:13.008
Okay? I'm giving
you a chance.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.468
We're here, aren't we?

02:14.509 --> 02:16.303
We're hanging out--
what do you want?

02:16.344 --> 02:17.429
What I want

02:17.471 --> 02:20.975
is to have things
how they used to be.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.270
I want you to come over
to my house,

02:25.312 --> 02:26.647
tomorrow night.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.107
What do you say?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.068
I say I-I have homework.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.612
Come on, we used to always
hang out at my house.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.947
Damn it!

02:34.989 --> 02:37.282
Just... You know what,
I'm getting really

02:37.324 --> 02:39.785
sick and tired
of this attitude of yours.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.703
We had a deal.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.499
And you know what's at stake.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.836
Okay.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.212
I'll go to your house.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.262
Hey.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.388
Hey.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.765
(locker closes)

03:01.807 --> 03:04.143
I've been looking
all over for you.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.560
We should talk.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.981
Yeah. Yeah, we should.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.232
So, what are
you thinking?

03:12.484 --> 03:14.319
I want to get back together.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.570
(giggles)

03:17.322 --> 03:18.782
Cool.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.034
Cool.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.952
(giggles)

03:37.217 --> 03:38.677
Good morning.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.679
Good morning, sweetheart.
Somebody's in
a good mood.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.847
(chuckles)
(Annie sniffs)

03:41.889 --> 03:43.015
Are you wearing
cologne?

03:43.057 --> 03:45.350
Maybe a splash.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.186
Well, I have to go
clear my nose out.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.188
So what happened, did you win
the lottery last night

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
or something?
Not exactly.
(chuckles)

03:51.272 --> 03:53.358
But I did wake up
with a good feeling.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.360
I think something that
I've been really worried about

03:55.402 --> 03:56.486
is finally gonna work out.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.738
DEBBIE: Is this about
your birth mother?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.364
Did she e-mail you back?

03:59.406 --> 04:01.033
No. No, she didn't.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.492
I'm sorry.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.619
Oh, no, no, no.
It's, it's cool, it's fine.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.706
You know, so she doesn't
want to see me; big deal.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.167
(chuckles)
She has her own life, right?

04:10.209 --> 04:11.752
And you're okay?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.712
Me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.172
Things are good.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.548
And they're gonna get better.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.673
Yeah.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.051
You know what? Got to
get ready for school.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.677
Don't want to be late.
Okay.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.554
Mwa!
Have a good day.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.057
See you, bub.
Peace.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.405
Hey.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.116
Hey.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.118
I've been looking for you.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.744
We should talk.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.704
Yeah.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.998
So... what are you thinking?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.584
(sighs)

04:52.626 --> 04:54.419
Oh.
Look,

04:54.461 --> 04:56.755
I really, really care
about your friendship.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.882
I mean, and I-I really,

04:58.924 --> 05:00.634
really want us to be friends.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.427
Still into Teddy, huh?

05:02.469 --> 05:05.597
No. It's... it's not like
it's an either/or thing,

05:05.639 --> 05:06.932
Teddy or Dixon.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.558
Look, it has nothing
to do with Teddy.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.643
I just...

05:10.978 --> 05:14.940
I don't feel that way
about you anymore.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.108
Or right now.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.276
I'm-I'm sorry.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.154
But I really...
Really, really

05:20.195 --> 05:21.738
want to be friends, huh?

05:21.780 --> 05:22.739
Yeah.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.574
And I'm serious
about that.

05:24.616 --> 05:28.287
I like having you back
in my life, and...

05:28.328 --> 05:30.289
I want it to stay that way.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.628
(big sigh):
Okay.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.130
It will.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.547
Okay.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.310
How's the burger?

05:51.350 --> 05:52.644
It's not bad.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.979
You want a bite?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.396
No, I'm fine.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.441
Want a bite of my
extremely dry chicken?

05:58.483 --> 05:59.734
No.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.154
But I'm sorry it's dry.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.323
You want me to run up
and get you something else?

06:04.363 --> 06:05.866
Oh, no. I was

06:05.907 --> 06:07.034
just making a little joke.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.327
Oh.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.494
Apparently, a bad one.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.579
No, it wasn't bad, it was...

06:11.621 --> 06:12.873
it was funny.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.293
(chuckles)

06:16.335 --> 06:19.587
I was actually doing
some reading about
boats yesterday.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.714
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

06:20.755 --> 06:22.549
Apparently,
the earliest
boats were built

06:22.590 --> 06:24.176
over 40,000
years ago.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.844
They weren't, like,
cruise ships or anything...

06:25.886 --> 06:27.179
More like canoes?

06:27.221 --> 06:28.638
Yes, exactly. Canoes.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.806
Hey, potato head.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.142
Oh! What the hell!

06:32.184 --> 06:34.686
Be prepared to go down!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.688
Not gonna happen, sucker!

06:36.730 --> 06:38.357
(laughing):
Careful! Ow!

06:39.398 --> 06:40.359
Okay, okay!

06:40.399 --> 06:41.818
Liam, I give up, okay?

06:41.860 --> 06:42.986
Mercy. Geez.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.612
That's what I'm
talking about!

06:44.654 --> 06:45.364
Whoo!

06:46.740 --> 06:47.991
Later, loser.
Bye, Naomi.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.534
Bye.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.161
(clears throat)

06:51.203 --> 06:52.871
Sorry about that.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.664
What were we talking about?

06:54.706 --> 06:55.707
Canoes.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.584
Canoes. Exactly.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.423
(humming a tune)

07:04.465 --> 07:05.884
Hey, Ives.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.510
Hey! What's up?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.221
You're totally
over Liam, right?

07:09.263 --> 07:10.389
Me?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.932
Uh, yeah. I mean,

07:11.973 --> 07:14.768
I mean, I'm-I'm the one that got
you guys together, remember?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.270
Yeah. No, I
know, I know.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.562
I just wanted to double-check,

07:17.604 --> 07:19.773
because I could really
use your help on something.

07:19.814 --> 07:23.026
And in exchange, I will give you
some fabulous fashion tips.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.070
First of all, you should
burn that T-shirt.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.614
Yeah, listen, Naomi,
I-I really got to go, okay?

07:27.655 --> 07:30.075
No, please, listen,
i-it's me and Liam, okay?

07:30.117 --> 07:33.494
We obviously
have incredible
sexual chemistry.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.414
Good to know.
Look, I really...

07:35.455 --> 07:38.250
It's just, I don't understand
why he's so stiff around me.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.626
Uh, outside the bedroom.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.461
Inside, like I said,
he's plenty stiff.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.670
Right, like you said.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.755
I'm just trying

07:43.797 --> 07:45.757
really, really hard,
and it seems like

07:45.799 --> 07:47.092
he's completely
uncomfortable
around me.

07:47.134 --> 07:50.095
But then I see him
with you, and he
is so relaxed,

07:50.137 --> 07:51.263
throwing French fries...

07:51.305 --> 07:53.765
(sighs):
What do you think
the problem is?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.767
Look, you know,
I-I'm not really sure.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.102
It's not like I spend

07:57.144 --> 07:58.937
a lot of time
with the two of you, so...

07:58.979 --> 08:00.230
Yeah, you're right.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.773
We should all
do something together.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.857
(scoffs)

08:04.151 --> 08:05.277
Excuse me?

08:05.319 --> 08:07.446
Well, he's clearly
more relaxed around you,

08:07.487 --> 08:09.406
and maybe it'll rub
off on me, you know?

08:09.448 --> 08:11.616
Please? I really want
this relationship to work out.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.746
Yeah. Okay.

08:16.788 --> 08:18.581
Let's all do
something together.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.583
You know what?
I know just the thing.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.210
Yes! Thank you!
Thank you!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.476
(knocking)

08:37.517 --> 08:38.684
Hey. Come in.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.445
My parents are away.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.155
We have the whole
house to ourselves.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.117
Look, Annie, I know

08:54.159 --> 08:55.869
what's been the
problem between us.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.955
We haven't been
connecting lately,

08:58.997 --> 09:01.166
and I think
it's because...

09:01.208 --> 09:03.001
we haven't been intimate.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.128
Intimate?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.381
If we have sex,
then you'll remember

09:07.422 --> 09:10.008
how magical things
used to be between us.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.010
You'll remember our
special connection.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.303
Now, come here.

09:13.345 --> 09:14.804
(exhales)

09:14.846 --> 09:16.348
Jasper, no.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.598
No?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
What do you mean, no?

09:20.685 --> 09:22.270
I mean...

09:22.312 --> 09:24.356
I-I can't sleep with you.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.107
(stamps foot)
You have to!

09:27.234 --> 09:28.318
I mea... I mean,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.570
you have to...

09:30.611 --> 09:32.489
You have to give us a chance.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.908
Are you...

09:34.949 --> 09:37.952
Are you saying that
if I don't have sex with you,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.704
you're gonna go to the police?

09:39.746 --> 09:42.123
Don't be vulgar, Annie.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.043
What I want
is what's good

09:45.085 --> 09:46.503
for both of us.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.712
I just want...

09:47.754 --> 09:50.924
us to have
a real chance.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.911
Mm, Jasper, no.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.080
I can't.
(shudders)

10:22.122 --> 10:23.664
I...

10:23.706 --> 10:25.166
I can't have sex with you,

10:25.208 --> 10:27.835
a-and... and I can't be
in a relationship with you.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.296
I just... I can't.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.671
And if that means

10:30.713 --> 10:32.257
you have to go to the police,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.008
then you have to go
to the police.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.594
You don't mean that.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.929
Yeah, I do.
You don't mean
that, Annie.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.180
Yeah, I do!

10:39.222 --> 10:41.724
And if you love me,
like you claim to,

10:41.766 --> 10:42.934
and you want even

10:42.976 --> 10:44.811
the slimmest chance of us
getting back together,

10:44.852 --> 10:46.521
then you won't
go to the police.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.607
'Cause if you go
to the police,

10:48.648 --> 10:49.983
that's it.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.152
Th-That chance that
we might get back together,

10:52.193 --> 10:55.280
that one-in-
a-million chance,

10:55.322 --> 10:56.739
it'll be gone.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.578
(door opens)

11:01.620 --> 11:03.037
(door slams)

11:13.006 --> 11:14.715
Naomi, stick
around a second.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.800
I want to talk to you.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.970
Um, any similarities
between my paper

11:19.012 --> 11:20.639
and the Wikipedia entry
is purely coincidental, so...

11:20.679 --> 11:22.474
No, it's not that.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.725
Oh, so I was just kidding.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.145
So what's up?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.606
I'm just checking in.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.816
I want to see how you're
holding up since Jen.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.360
Oh.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.069
Yeah, I am okay.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.530
Good. I'm glad.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.365
Hey, uh, I actually have

11:38.406 --> 11:39.824
some of her stuff.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.201
It's mostly clothes,
and it's probably expensive.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.036
You know what,
just throw it out.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.162
Or better yet,

11:44.204 --> 11:45.330
put it up on eBay

11:45.372 --> 11:46.914
and buy yourself a new pair
of shoes.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.376
Look, I just want you to know,
if there's anything

11:49.417 --> 11:50.585
that you need...
I'm fine,

11:50.627 --> 11:52.295
Mr. Matthews.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.715
Okay.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.885
Are-are you all right?

11:58.926 --> 12:00.887
I mean, she was pretty
awful to you, too,

12:00.928 --> 12:02.847
using you to bait
rich men or whatever.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.391
What's that?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.060
She told me it looked good
for her to be dating a teacher.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.102
That way,
rich men wouldn't think

12:08.144 --> 12:09.396
that she was just
after their money.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.902
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't realize
it would bother you.

12:15.943 --> 12:18.071
I mean, she's clearly
a sociopath.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.281
Yeah, I know, yeah.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.991
Um, you know, don't
worry, I'm fine.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.495
You're going to be late
for your next class.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.331
Yeah.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.427
(knocks)
Hey, you busy?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.011
No, I'm just slacking
off a little bit,

12:42.053 --> 12:43.096
'cause Navid's not here.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.098
Oh, great.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.765
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have brought him up.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.602
Have you been able
to get ahold of him?

12:48.643 --> 12:50.270
No.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.272
But in a way,
it's actually easier.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.107
You know, not being
able to see him

12:54.148 --> 12:55.442
or talk to him.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.360
It makes my heart hurt less.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.778
Does that make me
a horrible person?

12:59.820 --> 13:01.615
No. Trust me,
I get it.

13:01.656 --> 13:05.826
In history, we're learning about
medieval torture techniques.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.121
And I got to say sitting next
to Alexa for 40 minutes

13:08.162 --> 13:10.331
pretty much trumps impalement.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.333
Well, when I pass Navid
in the hallway,

13:12.375 --> 13:14.127
it's like I can't breathe.
I saw Alexa

13:14.168 --> 13:17.297
getting out of her car
on La Brea,
Uh-huh.

13:17.338 --> 13:18.965
and I walked
into a lamppost.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.258
Shut up.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.468
I'm serious.
True story.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.927
I had a lump
on my head and
everything.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.305
Still didn't hurt as much
as my heart.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.805
Okay, you win.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.015
You are most miserable.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.100
Yes!

13:29.142 --> 13:30.644
(chuckles)
Sorry.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.479
Been awhile
since I won anything.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.314
(laughing)

13:34.355 --> 13:35.565
Cheers.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.857
Here's to being miserable.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.194
Being miserable.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.326
You guys are going to die
when you see the view

13:46.367 --> 13:47.702
from the top of this hike.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.787
I'm talking full 360.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.413
Right on.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.207
Being outdoors reminds me L.A.'s
got more to offer than Botox.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.668
I know I love
the outdoors.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.796
All the rocks, dirt.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.339
Chance to wear khaki.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.924
You know, it's funny, I never
thought you'd like hiking.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.385
Well, I am full
of surprises.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.430
Come on, guys,
let's get going.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.807
Let's do it.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.852
Sorry if this isn't
really your thing.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.689
I just thought,
you know, getting outside,

14:15.730 --> 14:17.273
a little physical
activity,

14:17.315 --> 14:19.859
help you guys, I don't know,
get out of your heads, whatever.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.152
No, I totally agree.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.445
I mean, it's already working.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.030
He fist-bumped me.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.870
So what exactly is
a seitan burger?

14:30.911 --> 14:35.542
It's like a burger, except
instead of the burger part,

14:35.583 --> 14:36.668
it has seitan.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.044
I don't know.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.087
It sounds to me like you're
eating a Satan burger.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.298
(laughing)
Well, it is the best
thing you can get

14:42.340 --> 14:44.300
for six dollars
and sixty-six cents.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.222
See, this is--
this is nice, right?

14:49.263 --> 14:50.390
Us hanging out,

14:50.431 --> 14:51.558
being friends.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.810
Yeah, it is.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.563
Hey, so, uh,

14:56.604 --> 14:57.980
have you heard back

14:58.022 --> 14:59.065
from your birth mother?

14:59.106 --> 15:02.402
Um, no.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.278
No, actually.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.572
But you know, it's cool, though.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.240
I'm kind of used to
being rejected.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.575
(laughing)
Dixon.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.910
Aw, come on,
I'm just joking.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.871
Hey, what's up?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.789
Good to see you.
This is Savannah.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.916
SILVER:
Hmm. Looks like Teddy's
still hanging out

15:16.957 --> 15:18.918
with that girl
from the dance.

15:18.959 --> 15:22.004
Can't believe they're actually
still seeing each other.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.006
This is like a long-term
relationship for him.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.592
(laughs)

15:25.633 --> 15:28.302
You... you met her
at the dance, right?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.679
What's she like?

15:29.721 --> 15:31.138
Oh, um...

15:31.180 --> 15:33.015
I don't know.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.268
Wasn't really paying attention.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.812
She looks really friendly.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.230
Yeah, are you almost
done with your burger?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.314
I can get the check.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.775
Check, please?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.943
Hi.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.027
Hi.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.947
Look, I know I'm way out
of line here,

15:47.988 --> 15:49.282
but I have to tell you,

15:49.323 --> 15:50.784
I think you're making
a huge mistake

15:50.825 --> 15:52.702
rejecting a great guy
like my brother.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.328
TEDDY:
Savannah.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.789
I'm sorry.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.123
We're just leaving.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.083
I'm sorry, I just had
to say my piece.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.627
I mean, he's never been
like this

16:00.668 --> 16:02.378
over a girl before.
I just can't stand...

16:02.420 --> 16:04.714
Leaving now.
Okay.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.215
I'm really sorry.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.385
Good to see you
again, Dixon.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.056
Wait, you-- you knew?

16:14.098 --> 16:16.350
You knew this whole time that
that girl was Teddy's sister?!

16:16.392 --> 16:17.727
Yeah, but...

16:17.769 --> 16:19.186
Kind of, yeah.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.480
Silver, look, Teddy's a player,

16:20.521 --> 16:22.732
and he's always going
to be one, all right?

16:22.774 --> 16:24.317
He didn't hurt
you just now,

16:24.358 --> 16:26.277
but eventually he would have.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.821
And I care about you.

16:27.862 --> 16:29.656
I just wanted to protect you.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.659
No. You have no right
to make that decision for me.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.993
Silver...

16:34.034 --> 16:35.453
No. I-I don't even
want to hear it.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.080
What kind of friend are you?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.715
I'm just saying
it's not always easy
listening to Coach

16:47.757 --> 16:49.509
because I'm a way better
surfer than he is.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.386
I'm hoping you didn't
tell him that.
Oh, I did,

16:52.428 --> 16:54.221
except I think
I used the words

16:54.263 --> 16:56.850
suck my...

16:56.891 --> 16:59.143
which is not such
a good idea.
You okay, Naomi?

17:00.394 --> 17:04.691
(breathlessly):
Yeah, just taking my time.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.066
Enjoying the great outdoors.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.861
Hey, watch out for
that poison oak.
What?! Where?!

17:07.902 --> 17:08.862
Sorry, to the left.
Where?!

17:08.903 --> 17:09.863
No, no, my left.
What?!

17:09.904 --> 17:12.156
By the garter snake.
What?!

17:17.118 --> 17:19.664
Come on.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.800
Sorry I couldn't
make it to the top.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.468
Well, stop.
Don't be silly.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.721
Yeah, I mean the view
isn't even really that great.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.805
You might as well just

17:35.847 --> 17:37.390
buy the postcard,
right?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.558
Liam...

17:38.599 --> 17:41.227
would you mind
filling up my canteen?

17:41.268 --> 17:42.645
I'm really thirsty.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.646
Yeah, you got it.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.317
Just so you know,
I'm on to you.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.777
What?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.529
You've been trying
to make me look bad

17:51.571 --> 17:53.614
because you still like Liam.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.659
Okay, Naomi, that's ridiculous.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.078
Oh, wow, what's worse--

17:59.119 --> 18:00.955
you're too much
of a coward to admit it.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.540
Ugh.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.209
I am not a coward.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.586
Oh, really?

18:06.627 --> 18:08.796
Well, then come clean.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.175
Fine.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.510
I like him.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.970
I like him a lot.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.764
And you know what,
you guys suck as a couple.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.640
That's not true.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.475
Okay, so why'd you
ask for my help?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.978
Just stay away from him.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.104
That's going to be hard.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.231
I mean, we are on
the surf team together.

18:27.273 --> 18:30.860
Well, then it's going to be hard
for me to not take you down.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.195
I'd really like to see you try.

18:33.237 --> 18:38.534
Oh, honey, you have no idea
what you're up against.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.093
Hey.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.469
Mind if I sit with you?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.345
Sure.

19:00.765 --> 19:05.394
Um, look, man, I have
something I got to tell you.

19:05.436 --> 19:08.064
Shoot.

19:08.106 --> 19:11.109
Um, Silver was really into you
at the Winter Wonderland Dance,

19:11.150 --> 19:12.902
and she was going to tell you.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.612
But when she saw
you with Savannah,

19:14.654 --> 19:17.740
she thought that you were
flirting with another girl.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.075
She was?

19:19.117 --> 19:20.910
She did?

19:20.952 --> 19:24.956
And I... I let her think that.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.876
Look, I really like her, man.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.462
And when she was feeling
really vulnerable,

19:31.504 --> 19:33.089
that's when I kissed her.

19:33.131 --> 19:36.759
So, you should know that
the kiss didn't mean
anything to her.

19:36.801 --> 19:41.097
All right? I lied when I said we
might be getting back together,

19:41.139 --> 19:45.518
and I lied when I told you she
wanted you to leave her alone.

19:45.559 --> 19:49.438
What the hell, bro?

19:49.480 --> 19:52.316
Yeah. You should punch me.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.654
Look, I can give you
a bunch of excuses

19:56.696 --> 19:58.739
to why I did what
I did, all right?

19:58.781 --> 20:00.867
I was rejected by Silver.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.994
I've been rejected
by my birth mom.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.955
I failed a math test
that I studied for for
three frickin' hours.

20:05.997 --> 20:10.501
But the truth is,
none of that matters.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.838
None of those excuses
are good enough.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.632
So...

20:16.674 --> 20:19.343
(sighs)

20:19.385 --> 20:20.594
You should punch me.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.723
(chuckles)

20:24.515 --> 20:25.683
(groans)

20:25.725 --> 20:28.227
(coughs)

20:28.268 --> 20:30.188
Okay...

20:30.229 --> 20:31.480
I deserved that.

20:31.522 --> 20:32.857
Yeah, you did.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.983
You screwed up.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.359
At least you came clean.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.363
Well, I feel better.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.200
Yeah, me, too.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.411
Yeah, well,
not-not better.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.371
So, uh... what now?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.373
Silver likes you, man.

20:49.415 --> 20:52.292
Go for it.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.297
GIA:
Okay, pity party checklist.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.925
First thing we need,
sad movies.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.176
SILVER:
Okay.

21:00.218 --> 21:04.055
Um, The Way We Were,
An Affair to Remember,

21:04.097 --> 21:05.890
P.S. I Love You,
The Notebook.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.100
Oh, not The Notebook.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.267
I watched that
with Alexa.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.393
Love Story?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.603
Does anyone die?

21:10.644 --> 21:12.354
Yes, and she's so young, too.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.397
Perfect.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.066
(laughing)

21:15.108 --> 21:16.067
Hey.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.777
Oh, hi.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.696
Alexa, this is Adrianna.

21:20.738 --> 21:21.948
Hi. Nice to meet you.

21:21.989 --> 21:22.949
You, too.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.200
Um, so listen, I was wondering

21:24.242 --> 21:25.743
if maybe we could
talk at some point?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.787
Yeah, sure.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.413
Cool. Well, um, I'll call
you later?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.456
Okay.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.129
Maybe she wants
to get back together.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.421
Yeah, right.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.048
Well, why else
would she want to talk?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.926
Who knows? Maybe
she's still mad at me

21:41.968 --> 21:43.886
for saying that Rachel McAdams
was hot.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.388
Did I tell you we got in a fight
when we watched The Notebook?

21:46.430 --> 21:48.641
Okay, well, I hope
it works out.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.101
Besides, a true pity party

21:50.143 --> 21:52.478
is a solo affair, right?

22:18.254 --> 22:21.924
It was actually harder to
track down than I expected.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.927
I had to call nearly a
dozen auto body shops,

22:24.969 --> 22:26.804
pretending to be a guy
from your insurance company

22:26.846 --> 22:29.932
before I struck
gold. But I did.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.558
I struck gold.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.269
They were very
cordial, meticulous.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.436
They kept
excellent records.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.106
That photo, however,

22:37.148 --> 22:38.649
was a real bonus.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.442
Is this a threat?

22:40.484 --> 22:41.610
It's a present.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.782
You know what?

22:46.824 --> 22:48.284
You win.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.994
You want to get
back together?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.830
No.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.624
If you want people
to know what I did, then...

22:55.666 --> 22:57.335
I'll tell them.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.880
I'm going to confess.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.577
Hi, Liam!

23:38.084 --> 23:39.377
(laughs):
Oh.

23:39.417 --> 23:41.045
Well, aren't you cute?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.797
You look like
a little wet seal.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.716
I hope no one clubs you.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.344
I think I'll be fine.

23:48.386 --> 23:51.931
I'm actually just going to head
back into the water with Liam.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.224
Well, you have fun, now.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.727
I'll just be waiting
for him when he gets back.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.436
All oiled up!

24:15.955 --> 24:17.415
Hi.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.083
Hi.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.251
Dixon told me the truth.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.379
About the dance and Savannah
and-and everything.

24:23.421 --> 24:24.964
Yeah, uh...

24:25.005 --> 24:26.424
I thought Savannah was a girl.

24:26.464 --> 24:27.633
Well, obviously,
she's a girl,

24:27.674 --> 24:29.176
but I thought that
she was a girl-girl,

24:29.218 --> 24:31.929
not like a sister-girl.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.598
Well, she's a sister-girl.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.436
I'm sorry
for assuming the worst

24:38.476 --> 24:41.105
and for overreacting.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.522
You know, and kissing Dixon.

24:43.941 --> 24:46.444
He did tell you
about that, right?

24:46.484 --> 24:48.154
Y-Yeah. Yeah, I
knew about that.

24:48.195 --> 24:51.449
And it's okay. I don't,
I don't really care.

24:51.489 --> 24:53.491
What I care about is what
you were going to tell me

24:53.533 --> 24:56.329
at the dance-- you know,
when you were coming
up to talk to me

24:56.370 --> 24:59.332
before the whole mix-up
with my sister-girl.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.458
(chuckles uncomfortably)

25:00.498 --> 25:02.626
You wanted to get
together, huh?

25:02.668 --> 25:05.254
Yeah. I wanted to get together.

25:05.296 --> 25:08.966
So, can we just pick up
where we left off?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.260
No.

25:11.302 --> 25:12.636
No?

25:12.678 --> 25:15.681
I freaked out because
I thought you were a player,

25:15.722 --> 25:18.142
and, I mean, come on, you are.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.060
You've already been
with, like, two girls

25:20.102 --> 25:21.687
since we've been
back to school, and...

25:21.728 --> 25:24.106
That was because I thought
you didn't like me.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.191
Now that I know,
things are different...

25:25.232 --> 25:26.524
Teddy, stop.

25:26.566 --> 25:27.693
How much could you like me

25:27.734 --> 25:30.570
if you were able
to move on so quickly?

25:40.373 --> 25:42.333
(engine starts)

26:00.017 --> 26:02.686
I'll take another.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.355
Drinking on a
school night, huh?

26:04.397 --> 26:05.523
(chuckles)

26:05.563 --> 26:07.400
Hair of the dog.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.776
Last night was a
school night, too.

26:11.028 --> 26:12.696
You gonna tell
on me or something?

26:14.407 --> 26:17.617
Those who live
in glass houses...

26:21.914 --> 26:23.541
Let's just say it's been
a rough couple of weeks.

26:23.581 --> 26:25.000
I hear that.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.710
(chuckles)

26:26.752 --> 26:29.171
I'm Laurel.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.756
I'm Ryan.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.883
Would you excuse me, Ryan,

26:32.925 --> 26:36.678
while I go put some real
music on that jukebox?

26:45.271 --> 26:46.522
Hey, you.

26:46.564 --> 26:47.731
You look good
out there.

26:47.773 --> 26:48.857
Hey.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.192
Aren't you cold?

26:50.234 --> 26:52.486
Oh, I'm one of those people
who usually runs really hot.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.737
Oh.
(laughs)

26:53.779 --> 26:55.322
So, I brought you
some food.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.908
Figured you'd worked up

26:57.950 --> 26:59.868
a great, big appetite
out there.
Sure did.

26:59.910 --> 27:00.827
What you got in there?

27:00.869 --> 27:03.497
Just some sandwiches.
Ooh.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.707
Looks lie you got a bunch.
Mind if I grab one?

27:05.749 --> 27:08.377
This is really
nice of you, Naomi.

27:08.419 --> 27:09.920
Thanks.
My pleasure.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.838
Hey, Coach. Na brought
some sammies. You want one?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.173
COACH:
Oh, no, I'm cool.

27:13.215 --> 27:14.758
Uh, Liam, can I talk
to you for a second?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.260
Yeah, sure.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.096
I'll be right back.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.515
Turkey and sprouts?
Good choice.

27:21.557 --> 27:24.393
I'm glad you're
enjoying it.

27:24.435 --> 27:27.271
Hey. What the--

27:27.313 --> 27:29.523
I'm so sorry. That was
totally an accident.

27:29.565 --> 27:32.109
Whatever.
I'm out of here.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.735
Ow!
Oops!

27:33.777 --> 27:35.862
What the hell?!
Sorry.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.615
An accident.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.451
(roars)

27:42.328 --> 27:43.496
(screams)

27:45.623 --> 27:47.583
(both grunting)

27:47.625 --> 27:49.667
Get the hell off me!

27:49.709 --> 27:51.878
You crazy--

27:51.920 --> 27:53.797
(Naomi grunting)

27:59.677 --> 28:01.054
(both grunting)

28:02.973 --> 28:03.974
What is wrong with you?

28:04.016 --> 28:06.352
(both grunting)
Geez!

28:06.393 --> 28:08.479
LIAM:
Naomi!

28:08.521 --> 28:10.772
You crazy bitch!

28:10.814 --> 28:12.191
What is wrong with you?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.526
(screams)
Naomi! Ivy, Ivy!

28:13.567 --> 28:15.319
Stop! Stop! Stop!

28:15.361 --> 28:16.487
(Naomi screaming)

28:16.529 --> 28:17.655
Relax. Relax.

28:17.695 --> 28:18.822
Stop!

28:18.864 --> 28:20.240
What the hell is going on?

28:20.282 --> 28:22.742
What is going on
is that Ivy has been

28:22.784 --> 28:24.786
trying to break us up
this whole time!

28:24.828 --> 28:26.163
Okay, that is obviously
not what I was trying to do.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.331
Liam, the girl is crazy.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.541
Stop it!
Stop it!

28:28.582 --> 28:29.707
Ever since I asked
you for help,

28:29.749 --> 28:30.876
you've been
working against me.

28:30.917 --> 28:34.129
But the truth is,

28:34.171 --> 28:36.173
I shouldn't have asked
you in the first place.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.675
'Cause you know what?

28:37.715 --> 28:39.259
She's not the problem.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.969
We are the problem.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.431
I wouldn't have had to ask
that she-devil for help

28:44.473 --> 28:47.142
if it hadn't been so
awkward between us.

28:47.184 --> 28:51.021
And I have been
trying so hard,

28:51.063 --> 28:54.024
so unbelievably hard to
be polite and perfect

28:54.066 --> 28:55.526
and to prove that we
have something in common.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.695
But you know what?
I am done trying.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.780
I'm done. This
is me, Liam.

29:00.822 --> 29:04.243
I don't give a crap about
how to build a boat.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.037
And I don't do
french fry fights.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.373
And I hate nature.
I hate it!

29:09.415 --> 29:11.584
If you think I am ever, ever
going on another hike again,

29:11.625 --> 29:12.792
you are out of your
freaking mind.

29:14.753 --> 29:19.508
And if you don't like
me... for who I am,

29:19.550 --> 29:21.801
then that's just
too damn bad!

29:39.069 --> 29:40.487
(laughs)

29:40.529 --> 29:41.739
Mm-mmm.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.407
I refuse to answer that.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.742
Come on. Come on!

29:44.783 --> 29:45.909
They're different.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.077
Yeah, but if you
had to choose.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.245
Had to?
Yeah.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.371
Who's going to make me?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.081
Maybe I am.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.208
(sighs)
Now, come on.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.585
Spill.
Who was better in bed?

29:54.627 --> 29:56.754
Keith Richards
or Mick Jagger?

29:56.795 --> 29:59.131
(sighs)

29:59.172 --> 30:01.425
Sorry, I don't
kiss and tell.

30:03.594 --> 30:04.762
Here you go.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.971
Although...

30:06.012 --> 30:08.390
Steven Tyler had it
over both of them.

30:08.432 --> 30:09.642
Steven Tyler?

30:09.683 --> 30:10.643
(laughs)

30:10.684 --> 30:11.769
Huh.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.978
Okay, your turn.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.813
Why are you really drinking
on a school night?

30:14.854 --> 30:18.776
I'm guessing either
you got dumped,

30:18.817 --> 30:22.571
or your indie rock
band just broke up.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.115
I don't have a rock band.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.372
You know the best way to
get over someone, right?

30:32.414 --> 30:33.457
What's that?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.877
Hair of the dog.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.637
So, what did you
want to talk about?

30:46.679 --> 30:48.972
I made a huge mistake,

30:49.014 --> 30:50.307
and I want to get
back together.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.978
Why? I mean, are you jealous

30:55.020 --> 30:56.438
'cause I've been
hanging out with Ade?

30:56.480 --> 30:57.481
'Cause we're just friends.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.607
No. It has nothing
to do with her.

30:58.649 --> 31:02.736
It has to do with us
and how much I miss you.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.864
So...

31:05.905 --> 31:08.241
Will you give me another shot?

31:35.101 --> 31:37.270
Screw Paris.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.233
(sobs)

31:41.274 --> 31:43.068
Oh...

31:43.109 --> 31:44.695
(sobbing):
Oh...

31:44.737 --> 31:45.863
Screw Paris and music
and all that stuff

31:45.904 --> 31:47.989
you thought you stole from me.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.199
(sobs)

31:49.241 --> 31:50.534
I don't care.
Don't you believe that?

31:50.576 --> 31:51.702
(sniffling):
Hey.

31:51.744 --> 31:53.412
Room for one more
at this pity party?

31:53.453 --> 31:54.580
Of course.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.332
Sit.

31:57.374 --> 31:58.876
What did Alexa say?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.754
I was so sure she'd want
to get back together.

32:01.795 --> 32:04.590
Yeah, well, she just wanted to
give me back some of my stuff.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.050
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.721
You are fantastic
and wonderful.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.890
And Alexa is an idiot
for ever letting you get away.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.684
Whatever. I'd rather
hang out with you anyway.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.352
(laughs)

32:17.394 --> 32:20.731
All right. We are going
to be starting this over.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.941
Be prepared to cry.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.359
That's why I came.

32:24.401 --> 32:25.485
(laughs)

32:25.527 --> 32:26.737
I brought reinforcement.

32:26.779 --> 32:30.574
(sentimental music plays)

32:30.616 --> 32:32.075
For you.
For you.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.829
(sighs)

33:31.593 --> 33:33.762
Wh-What are you
doing here?

33:33.804 --> 33:36.974
I couldn't stop...

33:37.015 --> 33:38.934
thinking about
what you said.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.645
I want that
one-in-a-million chance.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.981
Wait. So you're not gonna...?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.064
Go to the police? No.

33:46.733 --> 33:48.819
I love you too much.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.864
If you love something,
set it free.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.908
And if it comes back,
then it's yours.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.746
Just come back to me, Annie,
okay?

34:06.044 --> 34:07.921
(sighs)

34:17.222 --> 34:20.726
(sobs quietly)

34:24.187 --> 34:25.647
MASSEUR:
Feeling any better?

34:25.688 --> 34:27.440
Mm, much.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.695
Thank you, but I will definitely
need you to come back tomorrow.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.697
Getting into a girl fight
uses muscles

34:33.739 --> 34:36.491
I don't usually
work out at the gym.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.868
Same time?

34:37.909 --> 34:39.369
Yes, thank you.

34:39.411 --> 34:40.370
See you then.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.371
See you.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.455
Mm...

34:44.917 --> 34:47.293
Um, you, uh,
have a visitor.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.882
It's all right.
He can come in.

34:58.931 --> 35:02.350
You didn't really have to come
all the way over here.

35:02.392 --> 35:04.143
I actually prefer
to be broken up with

35:04.185 --> 35:05.645
over the phone.
It's much less...

35:13.445 --> 35:16.281
So, girl fights
turn you on?

35:16.322 --> 35:18.867
(chuckles) Look,

35:18.909 --> 35:21.912
I've been feeling
distant from you

35:21.954 --> 35:23.162
ever since we got
back together.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.790
and I couldn't
figure out what
was wrong,

35:24.831 --> 35:27.084
why we weren't
connecting.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.420
You've been so polite

35:30.462 --> 35:33.256
and so unlike the girl
that I fell for.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.300
I just want everything
to be perfect.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.972
I guess somehow that translated
into me not being myself.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.514
Well, I'm glad
you're done with that,

35:41.556 --> 35:44.017
because the girl
that I fell for

35:44.059 --> 35:50.315
is ballsy and opinionated
and sure of herself.

35:50.356 --> 35:54.152
And today...

35:54.193 --> 35:57.030
I finally saw her again.

35:57.072 --> 36:04.454
Mm. Well, you will be seeing
a lot more of her.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.466
(gasps)

36:21.638 --> 36:22.848
And even after showing

36:22.889 --> 36:24.516
what a colossal
bitch she is,

36:24.557 --> 36:25.642
Liam still chose Naomi.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.393
Whatever.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.938
He said he had
to make things
right with her.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.148
Clearly,
he's an idiot.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.732
Yeah, but you have
to say that,

36:32.774 --> 36:36.028
you're my mom.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.988
Come on.
You know me.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.239
I don't say things
just 'cause I have to.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.241
That's true.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.786
Can I interest you
in a toke?

36:44.828 --> 36:47.205
It might relax
you a little bit.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.332
No, I'll pass.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.543
Mom, you should really
give that stuff up.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.753
Yeah, well, I don't
respond well to "should" either.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.717
So did you
at least take

36:58.758 --> 37:00.760
the princess down
mano a mano?

37:00.802 --> 37:02.804
It was actually
kind of a draw.

37:02.846 --> 37:04.681
She's pretty scrappy.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.895
You hungry?

37:09.936 --> 37:13.190
You want to, you know,
grab some food or...?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.984
I'm cool.

37:16.026 --> 37:19.487
Yeah, you are cool.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.448
And Liam's an idiot,

37:22.490 --> 37:27.120
which is why he and Naomi
deserve each other.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.165
Maybe.

37:30.207 --> 37:32.625
You know, Mick Jagger
was an idiot, too.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.504
Why he chose Jerry Hall,
I'll never know.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.267
ADE:
No, I'm kidding.
Wah-wah.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.894
I'm really glad you called.

37:50.936 --> 37:51.937
Me, too.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.313
My schedule unexpectedly
cleared up.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.815
Oh, my God, these chips
are insane.

37:55.857 --> 37:57.316
Yeah. They're,
like, mental.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.027
Okay, guys,
we have to focus.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.653
We have work to do here.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.115
I am officially on the quest
for the perfect LSD.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.116
What?

38:04.157 --> 38:05.283
No, no, no.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.327
I'm, I'm sorry, LSD?

38:08.369 --> 38:10.789
Yes, every girl must have the
perfect little sequin dress.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.165
(laughs)

38:12.207 --> 38:13.374
The LSD is
the most important

38:13.416 --> 38:15.001
element to a girl's wardrobe

38:15.043 --> 38:16.669
because boys like shiny things.

38:16.711 --> 38:18.337
They're kind of like
babies in that regard.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.505
Or like trout.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.340
True, true.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.717
Liam is totally
a trout.

38:22.759 --> 38:24.385
So, things are good
with you guys?

38:24.427 --> 38:26.679
Yeah, they're good.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.347
I am glad.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.348
Me, too.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.017
I'm glad I didn't chicken out.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.352
And I might have
a bruise or two

38:33.394 --> 38:36.856
and what I think
is a dislocated
shoulder blade,
(girls laugh)

38:36.898 --> 38:39.525
but I took a risk
and I caught me a trout.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.320
Okay, but what if your trout
turns out to be a huge player?

38:42.361 --> 38:43.571
And yes,

38:43.613 --> 38:46.992
I may be conflating your fish
with my fish.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.910
You'll never know
unless you try.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.369
Yeah.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.038
All right, where's the waitress?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.207
We need some more
of these chips.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.983
I don't want to be with you.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.695
Yeah, you-you made that
pretty clear.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.738
No, I...

39:25.780 --> 39:27.490
I want to be with you,

39:27.532 --> 39:31.203
I just don't want
to want to be with you.

39:31.244 --> 39:35.581
Um... what are you saying?

39:35.623 --> 39:37.250
I'm scared.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.712
I like you a lot,

39:40.753 --> 39:44.924
and I want to trust you,
but I don't.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.135
So I'm scared.

39:47.177 --> 39:51.430
So, uh, what do we do now?

40:04.610 --> 40:06.863
You'd better not hurt me.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.376
ALEX TREBEK:
Protestant and Catholic
disagreement

40:19.417 --> 40:22.461
about the 1555 Peace
of Augsburg was a cause...

40:22.503 --> 40:23.922
DIXON:
Hundred Years War.

40:23.963 --> 40:25.673
Ooh, good guess.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.676
TREBEK: Evelyn?
The 30 Years War.

40:28.718 --> 40:29.802
EVELYN:
What is the Hundred Years War?

40:29.844 --> 40:31.012
TREBEK: No. Terry?

40:31.054 --> 40:33.181
TERRY: What is the 30 Years War?
TREBEK: Right.

40:33.223 --> 40:34.599
Oh, wow.

40:34.640 --> 40:35.808
TERRY:
I'll take "Confrontational"
for $800.

40:35.850 --> 40:39.187
TREBEK:
After shutting off trade
with the UK,

40:39.229 --> 40:40.855
President Madison advised
Congress...

40:40.897 --> 40:43.149
Oh, um, Madison, Madison...

40:43.191 --> 40:44.401
1812.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.444
TERRY:
What is the War of 1812?
TREBEK: Yes.

40:46.485 --> 40:47.820
(laughs)

40:47.862 --> 40:49.155
Wow, Harry, you're on a roll.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.198
No disrespect or anything,

40:50.240 --> 40:51.783
but you're a lot smarter
than I thought.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.492
Oh, come on.
Rule number one:

40:53.534 --> 40:55.494
Never underestimate
the dad.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.495
Okay.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.622
(knocking)

40:57.663 --> 40:58.998
I'll get it.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.293
"Getting Confrontational"
for $1,600.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.961
(TV volume mutes)

41:03.002 --> 41:05.797
Hey, wait a minute!
You TiVoed this!

41:05.838 --> 41:07.799
It is?
Harry!

41:07.840 --> 41:08.800
No! What?!

41:08.841 --> 41:09.801
Never underestimate

41:09.842 --> 41:11.344
how low the dad will sink.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.388
(Harry and Debbie laugh)

41:13.430 --> 41:14.597
DEBBIE:
I can't believe you.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.814
You're, you're here.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.400
I'm here.

41:25.442 --> 41:26.859
I hope it's okay.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.194
Dixon, who's there?

41:28.236 --> 41:29.528
Hi, I'm Dina.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.656
I'm Dixon's birth mom.
