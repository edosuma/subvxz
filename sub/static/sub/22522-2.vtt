<i>... in commemoration</i>
<i>of the doleful events...</i>

09:38.774 --> 09:41.743
<i>... of the battle of Dannoura.</i>

09:52.889 --> 09:56.086
This legend raises a lovely problem:

09:56.292 --> 10:00.126
How does it come about that the face
of a warrior...

10:00.329 --> 10:05.096
...is cut on the carapace of
a Japanese crab? How could it be?

10:05.301 --> 10:09.863
The answer seems to be
that humans made this face.

10:10.206 --> 10:11.673
But how?

10:11.874 --> 10:15.139
Like many other features,
the patterns on the back...

10:15.344 --> 10:18.711
...or carapace of this crab
are inherited.

10:18.915 --> 10:23.318
But among crabs, as among humans,
there are different hereditary lines.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.779
Now, suppose purely by chance...

10:26.989 --> 10:30.220
...among the distant ancestors
of this crab...

10:30.426 --> 10:35.159
...there came to be one which looked
just a little bit like a human face.

10:35.364 --> 10:38.856
Long before the battle, fishermen
may have been reluctant...

10:39.068 --> 10:41.093
...to eat a crab with a human face.

10:41.437 --> 10:43.803
In throwing it back into the sea...

10:44.006 --> 10:48.136
...they were setting into motion
a process of selection.

10:48.344 --> 10:52.872
If you're a crab and your carapace
is just ordinary...

10:53.082 --> 10:55.380
...the humans are gonna eat you.

10:55.584 --> 10:58.144
But if it looks a little bit
like a face...

10:58.354 --> 11:01.846
...they'll throw you back and you
can have lots of baby crabs...

11:02.058 --> 11:03.821
...that all look just like you.

11:04.026 --> 11:06.119
As many generations passed...

11:06.329 --> 11:09.196
...of crabs and fisher-folk alike...

11:09.398 --> 11:13.266
...the crabs with patterns that
looked most like a samurai face...

11:13.469 --> 11:15.664
...preferentially survived.

11:15.871 --> 11:19.432
Until eventually, there was produced
not just a human face...

11:19.642 --> 11:22.110
...not just a Japanese face...

11:22.311 --> 11:25.246
...but the face of a samurai warrior.

11:25.448 --> 11:29.407
All this has nothing to do
with what the crabs might want.

11:29.618 --> 11:33.054
Selection is imposed from the outside.

11:33.255 --> 11:37.191
The more you look like a samurai,
the better your chances of survival.

11:37.393 --> 11:42.057

that look like samurai warriors.

12:03.386 --> 12:06.947
This process is called
artificial selection.

12:07.690 --> 12:09.988
In the case of the Heike crab,
it was effected...

12:10.192 --> 12:13.059
...more or less unconsciously
by the fishermen...

12:13.262 --> 12:17.528
...and certainly without any serious
contemplation by the crabs.

12:17.733 --> 12:20.293

...which plants
and animals shall live.

12:25.474 --> 12:28.932
We're surrounded
by farm and domestic animals...

12:29.145 --> 12:30.442
<i>... fruits, vegetables.</i>

12:31.313 --> 12:34.942
<i>Where do they come from? Were they</i>
<i>once free-living in the wild...</i>

12:35.151 --> 12:38.985
<i>... and then induced to adopt some</i>
<i>less strenuous life on the farm?</i>

12:39.455 --> 12:40.444
No.

<i>The essence of artificial selection</i>
<i>for a horse or a cow...</i>

12:53.169 --> 12:56.502
<i>... a grain of rice</i>
<i>or a Heike crab, is this:</i>

12:56.705 --> 13:00.004
<i>Many characteristics are inherited.</i>
<i>They breed true.</i>

13:01.977 --> 13:05.572
<i>Humans encourage the reproduction</i>
<i>of some varieties...</i>

...and discourage
the reproduction of others.

eventually becomes abundant.

13:11.554 --> 13:15.513
<i>The variety selected against,</i>
<i>becomes rare, maybe extinct.</i>

13:16.725 --> 13:19.888
But if artificial selection
makes such changes...

13:20.096 --> 13:22.155
...in only a few thousand years...

13:22.364 --> 13:24.389
...what must natural selection...

13:24.600 --> 13:28.593
...working for billions of years,
be capable of?

<i>... is all the beauty and diversity</i>
<i>in the biological world.</i>

<i>That life evolved over</i>
<i>the ages is clear...</i>

13:42.918 --> 13:46.547
...from the changes we've made
in the beasts and vegetables...

13:46.889 --> 13:50.450
...but also from
the record in the rocks.

13:50.759 --> 13:53.523
The fossil evidence speaks
to us unambiguously...

13:53.729 --> 13:58.223
...of creatures that were once

13:58.434 --> 14:00.459
...and that have now vanished utterly.

But in those old rocks, there are
no fossils of people or cattle.

(BEE BUZZES)

14:39.942 --> 14:44.174
<i>That the mechanism of evolution is</i>
<i>natural selection was the discovery...</i>

<i>... of Charles Darwin</i>
<i>and Alfred Russel Wallace.</i>

14:48.484 --> 14:49.712
<i>Here's how it works:</i>

14:50.219 --> 14:51.743
Nature is prolific.

14:51.954 --> 14:55.822
There are many more creatures that
are born than can possibly survive.

14:56.025 --> 15:00.962
So those varieties which are,
by accident, less well adapted...

15:01.197 --> 15:04.689
...don't survive, or at least
they leave fewer offspring.

15:04.900 --> 15:09.360
Now, mutations, sudden
changes in heredity...

15:09.572 --> 15:11.631
...are passed on. They breed true.

15:11.840 --> 15:16.777
The environment selects the occasional
mutations which enhance survival.

15:17.012 --> 15:21.449
The resulting series of slow changes
in the nature of living beings...

15:21.650 --> 15:23.777
...is the origin of new species.

15:25.354 --> 15:28.721
Many people were scandalized...

15:28.924 --> 15:31.119
...by the ideas of evolution
and natural selection.

<i>and the beauty of life...</i>

The idea of a designer...

16:18.307 --> 16:22.971
...is an appealing and altogether human
explanation of the biological world.

16:23.178 --> 16:26.409
But as Darwin and Wallace showed...

16:26.615 --> 16:28.276
...there's another way...

16:28.484 --> 16:32.215
...equally human
and far more compelling.

16:32.621 --> 16:36.751
<i>Natural selection, which makes</i>
<i>the music of life more beautiful...</i>

16:36.959 --> 16:39.154
<i>... as the eons pass.</i>

16:42.831 --> 16:44.958
(LOUD RUMBLE)

16:45.200 --> 16:47.395
<i>To understand the passage</i>
<i>of the eons...</i>

16:47.603 --> 16:50.936
<i>... we have compressed all of time</i>
<i>into a single cosmic year...</i>

16:51.140 --> 16:54.473
<i>... with the big bang on January first.</i>

16:54.677 --> 16:59.114
<i>Every month here represents</i>
<i>a little over a billion years.</i>

16:59.315 --> 17:03.183
<i>The Earth didn't form until</i>
<i>the cosmic year was two-thirds over.</i>

17:03.385 --> 17:07.549
<i>Our understanding of the history</i>
<i>of life is very recent...</i>

17:07.756 --> 17:11.192
<i>... occupying only the last few</i>
<i>seconds of December 31...</i>

17:11.393 --> 17:15.523
<i>... that small white spot at bottom</i>
<i>right in the cosmic calendar.</i>

17:15.731 --> 17:18.131
<i>What happened on Earth may be</i>
<i>more or less typical...</i>

17:18.334 --> 17:20.802
<i>... of the evolution of life</i>
<i>on many worlds.</i>

17:21.003 --> 17:22.994
<i>But in its details...</i>

17:23.205 --> 17:25.400
<i>... the story of life on Earth...</i>

17:25.607 --> 17:28.405
<i>... is probably unique</i>
<i>in all the Milky Way galaxy.</i>

17:29.078 --> 17:33.515
<i>The secrets of evolution</i>
<i>are time and death.</i>

17:33.716 --> 17:37.550
<i>Time for the slow accumulation</i>
<i>of favorable mutations...</i>

17:37.753 --> 17:41.348
<i>... and death to make room</i>
<i>for new species.</i>

17:42.057 --> 17:45.322
<i>Life on Earth arose in September</i>
<i>of the cosmic calendar...</i>

17:45.527 --> 17:50.191
<i>... when our world, still battered and</i>
<i>cratered from its violent origin...</i>

17:50.399 --> 17:52.560
<i>... may have looked</i>
<i>a little like the moon.</i>

17:54.737 --> 17:58.264
The Earth is about four and a half
billion years old.

17:58.474 --> 17:59.805
In the cosmic calendar...

18:00.008 --> 18:04.001
...it condensed out of interstellar
gas and dust...

18:04.213 --> 18:06.841
...around September 14.

18:07.049 --> 18:10.712
We know from the fossil record
that life originated soon after...

18:10.919 --> 18:14.184
...maybe around September 25,
something like that...

18:14.390 --> 18:18.258
...probably in the ponds and oceans
of the primitive Earth.

18:18.494 --> 18:23.090
The first living things were not
as complex as a one-celled organism...

18:23.298 --> 18:26.927
...which is already a highly
sophisticated form of life.

18:27.136 --> 18:31.163
No, the first stirrings
of life were much more humble...

18:31.373 --> 18:34.206
...and happened on the molecular level.

18:34.410 --> 18:38.608
In those early days, lightning
and ultraviolet light from the sun...

18:38.814 --> 18:43.012
...were breaking apart hydrogen-rich
molecules in the atmosphere.

18:43.218 --> 18:47.712
The fragments of the molecules
were spontaneously recombining...

18:47.923 --> 18:51.723
...into more and more
complex molecules.

18:53.862 --> 18:57.821
The products of this early
chemistry dissolved in the oceans...

18:58.033 --> 19:01.332
...forming a kind of organic soup...

19:01.537 --> 19:03.664
...of gradually increasing complexity.

19:03.872 --> 19:07.672
Until one day, quite by accident...

19:07.876 --> 19:11.972
...a molecule arose that was able
to make crude copies of itself...

19:12.181 --> 19:15.617
...using as building blocks
the other molecules in the soup.

19:15.818 --> 19:19.276
This was the ancestor of DNA...

19:19.488 --> 19:22.855
...the master molecule
of life on Earth.

19:23.058 --> 19:26.721
It's made of four different
parts, called nucleotides...

19:26.929 --> 19:30.626
...which constitute the four letters
of the genetic code...

19:30.833 --> 19:32.391
...the language of heredity.

19:32.601 --> 19:37.470
Each of the nucleotides,
the rungs on the DNA ladder...

19:37.673 --> 19:39.971
...are a different color
in this model.

19:40.175 --> 19:43.440
The instructions are different
for different organisms.

19:43.645 --> 19:46.011
That's why organisms
are different.

19:46.215 --> 19:50.049
Now, a mutation is a change
of a nucleotide...

19:50.252 --> 19:53.278
...a misspelling
of the genetic instructions.

19:53.489 --> 19:58.358
Most mutations spell genetic
nonsense since they're random.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.755
They harm the next generation.

20:00.963 --> 20:03.261
But a very few, by accident...

20:03.465 --> 20:07.959
...make better sense than the
original codes, and aid evolution.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.969
DNA is about a billion
times smaller...

20:12.174 --> 20:13.903
...than we see it here.

20:14.109 --> 20:19.046
Each of those things that looks
like a piece of fruit is an atom.

20:19.248 --> 20:20.840
Without the tools of science...

20:21.049 --> 20:24.348
...the machinery of life
would be invisible.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.217
<i>Four billion years ago...</i>

20:30.425 --> 20:34.452
<i>... the ancestors of DNA competed</i>
<i>for molecular building blocks...</i>

20:34.663 --> 20:37.632
<i>... and left crude copies</i>
<i>of themselves.</i>

20:37.833 --> 20:41.098
<i>There were no predators;</i>
<i>the stuff of life was everywhere.</i>

20:41.303 --> 20:44.670
<i>The oceans and murky pools</i>
<i>that filled the craters...</i>

20:44.873 --> 20:48.172
<i>... were, for these molecules,</i>
<i>a Garden of Eden.</i>

20:48.510 --> 20:51.502
<i>With reproduction, mutation</i>
<i>and natural selection...</i>

20:51.713 --> 20:55.740
<i>... the evolution of living</i>
<i>molecules was well underway.</i>

20:56.285 --> 21:00.187
<i>Varieties with specialized</i>
<i>functions joined together...</i>

21:00.389 --> 21:03.415
<i>... making a collective.</i>
<i>The first cell.</i>

21:03.625 --> 21:06.685
<i>The organic soup eventually</i>
<i>ate itself up.</i>

21:06.895 --> 21:10.262
<i>But by this time, plants had evolved,</i>
<i>able to use sunlight...</i>

21:10.465 --> 21:15.198
<i>... to make their own building blocks.</i>
<i>They turned the waters green.</i>

21:15.404 --> 21:17.599
<i>One-celled plants</i>
<i>joined together:</i>

21:17.806 --> 21:20.832
<i>The first multi-cellular organisms.</i>

21:22.344 --> 21:26.781
<i>Equally important was the invention,</i>
<i>not made until early November...</i>

21:26.982 --> 21:31.476
<i>... of sex. It was stumbled upon</i>
<i>by the microbes.</i>

21:34.156 --> 21:37.819
<i>By December 1, green plants</i>
<i>had released copious amounts...</i>

21:38.026 --> 21:41.257
<i>... of oxygen and nitrogen</i>
<i>into the atmosphere.</i>

21:41.463 --> 21:44.762
<i>The sky is made by life.</i>

21:46.068 --> 21:48.798
<i>Then, suddenly, on December 15...</i>

21:49.004 --> 21:51.996
<i>... there was an enormous proliferation</i>
<i>of new life forms...</i>

21:52.207 --> 21:55.643
<i>... an event called</i>
<i>the "Cambrian Explosion."</i>

22:00.582 --> 22:05.076
We know from fossils that life arose
shortly after the Earth formed...

22:05.287 --> 22:09.018
...suggesting that the origin
of life might be...

22:09.224 --> 22:13.422
...an inevitable chemical process
on countless Earth-like planets...

22:13.629 --> 22:15.221
...throughout the cosmos.

22:15.430 --> 22:20.231
But on the Earth, in nearly 4 billion
years, life advanced no further...

22:20.435 --> 22:21.402
...than algae.

22:21.603 --> 22:26.404
So maybe more complex forms of life
are harder to evolve...

22:26.608 --> 22:29.168
...harder even than the origin
of life itself.

22:29.378 --> 22:32.040
If this is right, the planets
of the galaxy...

22:32.247 --> 22:34.909
...might be filled
with microorganisms...

22:35.117 --> 22:38.985
...but big beasts and vegetables
and thinking beings...

22:39.187 --> 22:41.985
...might be comparatively rare.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.521
<i>By December 18, there were vast</i>
<i>herds of trilobites...</i>

22:49.731 --> 22:51.858
<i>... foraging on the ocean bottom...</i>

22:52.067 --> 22:55.503
<i>... and squid-like creatures with</i>
<i>multicolored shells...</i>

22:55.704 --> 22:57.171
<i>... were everywhere.</i>

23:00.108 --> 23:03.703
<i>We know enough to sketch in a few</i>
<i>of the subsequent details.</i>

23:03.912 --> 23:07.609
<i>The first fish and the first</i>
<i>vertebrates appeared on December 19.</i>

23:07.816 --> 23:11.377
<i>Plants began to colonize the land</i>
<i>on December 20.</i>

23:11.586 --> 23:15.682
<i>The first winged insects fluttered by</i>
<i>on December 22.</i>

23:15.891 --> 23:19.019
<i>On this date also, there were</i>
<i>the first amphibians...</i>

23:19.227 --> 23:21.661
<i>... creatures something</i>
<i>like the lungfish...</i>

23:21.863 --> 23:25.128
<i>... able to survive both on land</i>
<i>and in water.</i>

23:25.333 --> 23:29.565
<i>Our direct ancestors were now</i>
<i>leaving the oceans behind.</i>

23:32.441 --> 23:37.378
<i>The first trees and the first reptiles</i>
<i>evolved on December 23:</i>

23:37.612 --> 23:40.877
<i>Two amazing evolutionary developments.</i>

23:43.218 --> 23:46.654
<i>We are descended</i>
<i>from some of those reptiles.</i>

23:51.059 --> 23:54.392
<i>The dinosaurs appeared</i>
<i>on Christmas Eve.</i>

23:54.596 --> 23:56.655
<i>There were many different</i>
<i>kinds of dinosaurs.</i>

23:56.865 --> 23:59.834
<i>The Earth was once their planet.</i>

24:02.971 --> 24:06.407
<i>Many stood upright and had</i>
<i>some fair intelligence.</i>

24:06.608 --> 24:11.443
<i>Great lizards crashed and thundered</i>
<i>through the steaming jungles.</i>

24:16.551 --> 24:19.179
<i>Unnoticed by the dinosaurs,</i>
<i>a new creature...</i>

24:19.387 --> 24:21.548
<i>... whose young were born live</i>
<i>and helpless...</i>

24:21.757 --> 24:24.089
<i>... was making its timid debut.</i>

24:24.292 --> 24:27.420
<i>The first mammals emerged</i>
<i>on December 26...</i>

24:27.629 --> 24:30.894
<i>... the first birds</i>
<i>on the following day.</i>

24:34.202 --> 24:37.603
<i>But the dinosaurs still</i>
<i>dominated the planet.</i>

24:37.806 --> 24:41.742
<i>Then suddenly, without warning,</i>
<i>all over the planet at once...</i>

24:41.943 --> 24:43.706
<i>... the dinosaurs died.</i>

24:43.912 --> 24:47.279
<i>The cause is unknown,</i>
<i>but the lesson is clear:</i>

24:47.482 --> 24:52.181
<i>Even 160 million years on a planet</i>
<i>is no guarantee of survival.</i>

24:52.387 --> 24:56.881
<i>The dinosaurs perished</i>
<i>around the time of the first flower.</i>

24:58.727 --> 25:00.854
On December 30, the first creatures...

25:01.062 --> 25:03.895
...who looked even a little bit human,
evolved...

25:04.099 --> 25:08.263
...accompanied by a spectacular increase
in the size of their brains.

25:08.470 --> 25:12.338
And then, on the evening
of the last day of the last month...

25:12.541 --> 25:14.168
...only a few million years ago...

25:14.376 --> 25:19.211
...the first true humans took
their place on the cosmic calendar.

25:20.515 --> 25:22.312
<i>The written record of history...</i>

25:22.517 --> 25:26.180
<i>... occupies only the last 10 seconds</i>
<i>of the cosmic year.</i>

25:28.690 --> 25:32.592
<i>Now, let's take a closer look</i>
<i>at who our ancestors were.</i>

25:32.794 --> 25:35.854
<i>A simple chemical circumstance</i>
<i>led to a great moment...</i>

25:36.064 --> 25:38.089
<i>... in the history of our planet.</i>

25:38.300 --> 25:41.235
<i>There were many molecules</i>
<i>in the primordial soup.</i>

25:41.436 --> 25:46.271
<i>Some were attracted to water on one</i>
<i>side and repelled by it on the other.</i>

25:46.474 --> 25:49.068
<i>This drove them together...</i>

25:49.277 --> 25:52.075
<i>... into a tiny enclosed</i>
<i>spherical shell...</i>

25:52.280 --> 25:55.078
<i>... like a soap bubble,</i>
<i>which protected the interior.</i>

25:55.283 --> 25:58.844
<i>Within the bubble,</i>
<i>the ancestors of DNA found a home...</i>

25:59.054 --> 26:00.749
<i>... and the first cell arose.</i>

26:00.956 --> 26:04.949
<i>It took hundreds of millions of years</i>
<i>for tiny plants to evolve...</i>

26:05.160 --> 26:06.627
<i>... giving off oxygen.</i>

26:06.828 --> 26:10.059
<i>But that branch didn't lead to us.</i>

26:10.565 --> 26:15.400
<i>Bacteria that could breathe oxygen</i>
<i>took over a billion years to evolve.</i>

26:16.771 --> 26:21.105
<i>From a naked nucleus, a cell</i>
<i>developed with a nucleus inside.</i>

26:22.510 --> 26:26.810
<i>Some of these amoeba-like forms</i>
<i>led eventually to plants.</i>

26:30.886 --> 26:32.820
<i>Others produced colonies...</i>

26:33.021 --> 26:37.287
<i>... with inside and outside cells</i>
<i>performing different functions.</i>

26:39.127 --> 26:40.458
<i>Becoming...</i>

26:40.662 --> 26:44.325
<i>... a polyp attached</i>
<i>to the ocean floor...</i>

26:44.532 --> 26:46.898
<i>... filtering food from the water...</i>

26:47.335 --> 26:49.860
<i>... and evolving little tentacles...</i>

26:50.071 --> 26:53.404
<i>... to direct food</i>
<i>into a primitive mouth.</i>

26:54.643 --> 26:56.338
<i>This humble ancestor of ours</i>
<i>also led...</i>

26:56.544 --> 27:00.708
<i>... to spiny-skinned armored animals</i>
<i>with internal organs...</i>

27:00.916 --> 27:04.784
<i>... including our cousin, the starfish.</i>

27:04.986 --> 27:07.420
<i>But we don't come from starfish.</i>

27:08.356 --> 27:10.620
<i>About 550 million years ago...</i>

27:10.825 --> 27:13.817
<i>... filter feeders</i>
<i>evolved gill slits...</i>

27:14.029 --> 27:17.328
<i>... which were more efficient</i>
<i>at straining food particles.</i>

27:17.532 --> 27:21.263
<i>One evolutionary branch</i>
<i>led to acorn worms.</i>

27:21.536 --> 27:26.064
<i>Another led to a creature which</i>
<i>swam freely in the larval stage...</i>

27:26.274 --> 27:29.607
<i>... but, as an adult, was still</i>
<i>firmly anchored to the ocean floor.</i>

27:29.811 --> 27:32.473
<i>Some became living hollow tubes.</i>

27:33.014 --> 27:37.348
<i>But others retained the larval forms</i>
<i>throughout the life cycle...</i>

27:37.552 --> 27:41.579
<i>... and became free-swimming adults</i>
<i>with something like a backbone.</i>

27:46.561 --> 27:48.119
<i>Our ancestors now...</i>

27:48.330 --> 27:52.664
<i>... 500 million years ago,</i>
<i>were jawless filter-feeding fish...</i>

27:52.867 --> 27:55.301
<i>... a little like lampreys.</i>

27:57.105 --> 27:59.335
<i>Gradually, those tiny fish...</i>

27:59.541 --> 28:02.203
<i>... evolved eyes and jaws.</i>

28:02.711 --> 28:04.872
<i>Fish then began to eat one another...</i>

28:05.080 --> 28:08.140
<i>... if you could swim fast,</i>
<i>you survived.</i>

28:09.884 --> 28:14.753
<i>If you had jaws to eat with, you could</i>
<i>use your gills to breathe in the water.</i>

28:15.056 --> 28:17.957
<i>This is the way modern fish arose.</i>

28:22.230 --> 28:24.790
<i>During the summer,</i>
<i>swamps and lakes dried up.</i>

28:25.000 --> 28:29.801
<i>Some fish evolved a primitive lung</i>
<i>to breathe air until the rains came.</i>

28:30.005 --> 28:32.303
<i>Their brains were getting bigger.</i>

28:32.507 --> 28:36.034
<i>If the rains didn't come, it was handy</i>
<i>to be able to pull yourself...</i>

28:36.244 --> 28:37.506
<i>... to the next swamp.</i>

28:37.712 --> 28:40.613
<i>That was a very important adaptation.</i>

28:44.152 --> 28:47.588
<i>The first amphibians evolved,</i>
<i>still with a fish-like tail.</i>

28:47.789 --> 28:52.158
<i>Amphibians, like fish, laid their eggs</i>
<i>in water where they were easily eaten.</i>

28:52.360 --> 28:54.988
<i>But then a splendid</i>
<i>new invention came along:</i>

28:55.196 --> 28:59.792
<i>The hard-shelled egg, laid on land</i>
<i>where there were as yet no predators.</i>

29:00.001 --> 29:04.563
<i>Reptiles and turtles</i>
<i>go back to those days.</i>

29:06.541 --> 29:09.874
<i>Many of the reptiles hatched on land</i>
<i>never returned to the waters.</i>

29:10.078 --> 29:12.603
<i>Some became the dinosaurs.</i>

29:12.981 --> 29:17.213
<i>One line of dinosaurs developed</i>
<i>feathers, useful for short flights.</i>

29:17.419 --> 29:22.288
<i>Today, the only living descendants</i>
<i>of the dinosaurs are the birds.</i>

29:23.992 --> 29:26.426
<i>The great dinosaurs evolved</i>
<i>along another branch.</i>

29:26.628 --> 29:29.654
<i>Some were the largest flesh-eaters</i>
<i>ever to walk the land.</i>

29:29.864 --> 29:34.631
<i>But 65 million years ago they all</i>
<i>mysteriously perished.</i>

29:35.870 --> 29:38.270
<i>Meanwhile, the forerunners</i>
<i>of the dinosaurs...</i>

29:38.473 --> 29:41.101
<i>... were also evolving</i>
<i>in a different direction.</i>

29:41.309 --> 29:44.039
<i>Small, scurrying creatures...</i>

29:44.245 --> 29:47.146
<i>... with the young growing</i>
<i>inside the mother's body.</i>

29:47.348 --> 29:51.751
<i>After the extinction of the dinosaurs,</i>
<i>many different forms developed.</i>

29:56.057 --> 29:58.753
<i>The young were very immature at birth.</i>

29:58.960 --> 30:02.020
<i>In the marsupials,</i>
<i>the wombat, for example...</i>

30:02.230 --> 30:05.825
<i>... and in the mammals, the young had</i>
<i>to be taught how to survive.</i>

30:06.034 --> 30:08.229
<i>The brain grew larger still.</i>

30:08.436 --> 30:12.770
<i>Something like a shrew was</i>
<i>the ancestor of all the mammals.</i>

30:17.479 --> 30:21.313
<i>One line took to the trees,</i>
<i>developing dexterity...</i>

30:21.516 --> 30:23.484
<i>... stereo vision, larger brains...</i>

30:23.685 --> 30:26.176
<i>... and a curiosity</i>
<i>about their environment.</i>

30:26.387 --> 30:31.222
<i>Some became baboons,</i>
<i>but that's not the line to us.</i>

30:32.594 --> 30:35.586
<i>Apes and humans have</i>
<i>a recent common ancestor.</i>

30:35.797 --> 30:39.756
<i>Bone for bone, muscle for muscle,</i>
<i>molecule for molecule.</i>

30:39.968 --> 30:44.905
<i>There are almost no important</i>
<i>differences between apes and humans.</i>

30:47.876 --> 30:52.176
<i>Unlike the chimpanzee,</i>
<i>our ancestors walked upright...</i>

30:52.380 --> 30:56.407
<i>... freeing their hands</i>
<i>to poke and fix and experiment.</i>

30:56.618 --> 31:00.076
<i>We got smarter. We began to talk.</i>

31:06.594 --> 31:09.256
<i>Many collateral branches</i>
<i>of the human family...</i>

31:09.464 --> 31:12.922
<i>... became extinct in</i>
<i>the last few million years.</i>

31:13.134 --> 31:17.537
<i>We, with our brains and our hands,</i>
<i>are the survivors.</i>

31:17.739 --> 31:22.676
<i>There's an unbroken thread that</i>
<i>stretches from those first cells to us.</i>

31:23.011 --> 31:24.308
<i>Let's look at it again...</i>

31:24.512 --> 31:29.313
<i>... compressing 4 billion years</i>
<i>of human evolution into 40 seconds.</i>

32:15.396 --> 32:18.559
<i>Those are some of the things</i>
<i>that molecules do...</i>

32:18.766 --> 32:21.826
<i>... given 4 billion years of evolution.</i>

32:23.037 --> 32:27.337
<i>We sometimes represent evolution as</i>
<i>the ever-branching ramifications...</i>

32:27.542 --> 32:28.907
<i>... of some original trunk...</i>

32:29.110 --> 32:33.376
<i>... each branch pruned and clipped</i>
<i>by natural selection.</i>

32:34.215 --> 32:36.183
<i>Every plant and animal</i>
<i>alive today...</i>

32:36.384 --> 32:40.787
<i>... has a history as ancient</i>
<i>and illustrious as ours.</i>

32:40.989 --> 32:44.356
<i>Humans stand on one branch.</i>

32:44.792 --> 32:47.693
<i>But now we affect</i>
<i>the future of every branch...</i>

32:47.895 --> 32:50.955
<i>... of this 4-billion-year-old tree.</i>

32:53.568 --> 32:56.628
How lovely trees are.

32:56.838 --> 33:00.069
The human species grew up
in and around them.

33:00.275 --> 33:03.210
We have a natural affinity for trees.

33:03.411 --> 33:05.470
Trees photosynthesize...

33:05.680 --> 33:08.410
...they harvest sunlight...

33:08.616 --> 33:12.518
...they compete for the sun's favors.

33:13.388 --> 33:15.117
Look at those two trees there...

33:15.323 --> 33:18.520
...pushing and shoving for sunlight...

33:18.726 --> 33:23.322
...but with grace
and astonishing slowness.

33:31.005 --> 33:33.235
<i>There are so many plants</i>
<i>on the Earth...</i>

33:33.441 --> 33:36.001
<i>... that there's a danger</i>
<i>of thinking them trivial...</i>

33:36.210 --> 33:40.340
<i>... of losing sight of the subtlety</i>
<i>and efficiency of their design.</i>

33:40.548 --> 33:45.110
<i>They are great and beautiful</i>
<i>machines, powered by sunlight...</i>

33:45.320 --> 33:49.154
<i>... taking in water from the ground</i>
<i>and carbon dioxide from the air...</i>

33:49.357 --> 33:53.953
<i>... and converting them into food</i>
<i>for their use and ours.</i>

34:02.303 --> 34:05.864
<i>This is a museum of living plants.</i>

34:06.074 --> 34:10.943
<i>The Royal Botanic Gardens</i>
<i>at Kew in London.</i>

34:16.651 --> 34:19.620
<i>Every plant uses</i>
<i>the carbohydrates it makes...</i>

34:19.821 --> 34:23.518
<i>... as an energy source</i>
<i>to go about its planty business.</i>

34:23.725 --> 34:27.559
<i>And we animals, who are ultimately</i>
<i>parasites on the plants...</i>

34:27.762 --> 34:31.596
<i>... we steal the carbohydrates</i>
<i>so we can go about our business.</i>

34:36.938 --> 34:39.600
<i>In eating the plants</i>
<i>and their fruits...</i>

34:39.807 --> 34:42.776
<i>... we combine the carbohydrates</i>
<i>with oxygen...</i>

34:42.977 --> 34:46.208
<i>... which as a result of breathing,</i>
<i>we've dissolved in our blood.</i>

34:46.414 --> 34:51.351
<i>From this chemical reaction, we</i>
<i>extract the energy which makes us go.</i>

34:51.786 --> 34:54.653
<i>In the process,</i>
<i>we exhale carbon dioxide...</i>

34:54.856 --> 34:58.257
<i>... which the plants then use</i>
<i>to make more carbohydrates.</i>

35:00.361 --> 35:03.057
<i>What a marvelous</i>
<i>cooperative arrangement!</i>

35:03.264 --> 35:06.392
<i>Plants and animals each using</i>
<i>the other's waste gases...</i>

35:06.601 --> 35:11.197
<i>... the whole cycle powered</i>
<i>by abundant sunlight.</i>

35:11.606 --> 35:15.372
<i>But there would be carbon dioxide in</i>
<i>the air even if there were no animals.</i>

35:15.576 --> 35:19.171
<i>We need the plants</i>
<i>much more than they need us.</i>

35:23.317 --> 35:27.276
There are family resemblances
among the organisms of the Earth.

35:27.488 --> 35:31.891
Some are very apparent,
such as the use of the number five.

35:32.093 --> 35:34.960
Humans have five major
bodily projections:

35:35.163 --> 35:38.462
One head, two arms, two legs.

35:38.666 --> 35:40.133
So do ducks...

35:40.334 --> 35:44.737
...although the functions of their
projections are not quite the same.

35:44.939 --> 35:48.431
An octopus or a centipede
has a different plan.

35:48.643 --> 35:53.342
And a being from another planet
might be much stranger still.

35:53.548 --> 35:58.417
These family resemblances continue
and on a much deeper level...

35:58.619 --> 36:01.554
...when we go to the
molecular basis of life.

36:01.756 --> 36:04.452
There are tens of billions...

36:04.659 --> 36:07.560
...of different kinds
of organic molecules.

36:07.762 --> 36:09.957
Yet only about 50 of them...

36:10.164 --> 36:13.258
...are used in the essential
machinery of life.

36:13.468 --> 36:15.902
<i>The same 50 employed</i>
<i>over and over again...</i>

36:16.103 --> 36:20.699
<i>... ingenious, for different functions</i>
<i>in every living thing.</i>

36:20.908 --> 36:23.672
<i>And when we go to the very kernel</i>
<i>of life on Earth...</i>

36:23.878 --> 36:27.336
<i>... to the proteins that</i>
<i>control cell chemistry...</i>

36:27.548 --> 36:31.450
<i>... to the spiral or helix</i>
<i>of nucleic acids...</i>

36:31.652 --> 36:34.246
<i>... which carry</i>
<i>the hereditary information...</i>

36:34.455 --> 36:38.482
<i>... we find these molecules</i>
<i>to be identical...</i>

36:38.693 --> 36:42.288
<i>... in all plants and animals</i>
<i>of our planet.</i>

37:07.088 --> 37:11.684
This oak tree and me,
we're made of the same stuff.

37:11.893 --> 37:14.794
If you go back, you'll find
that we have a common ancestor.

37:14.996 --> 37:18.227
That's why our chemistry is so alike.

37:21.269 --> 37:25.262
Let's take a trip to examine
this common basis of life.

37:25.473 --> 37:28.874
A voyage to investigate
the molecular machinery...

37:29.076 --> 37:31.203
...at the heart of life on Earth.

37:31.412 --> 37:34.973
A journey to the nucleus of the cell.

37:35.216 --> 37:36.740
First we need a cell.

37:37.318 --> 37:41.584
I have trillions.
I can afford to donate a few.

37:47.628 --> 37:50.358
<i>The casual act of pricking a finger...</i>

37:50.565 --> 37:54.194
<i>... is an event of some magnitude</i>
<i>on the scale of the very small.</i>

37:54.402 --> 37:59.101
<i>Millions of red blood cells are</i>
<i>detoured from their usual routes.</i>

38:01.075 --> 38:03.908
<i>But most continue</i>
<i>to cruise about the body...</i>

38:04.111 --> 38:08.070
<i>... carrying their cargoes of oxygen</i>
<i>to the remotest freckle.</i>

38:09.183 --> 38:11.378
<i>We're about to enter</i>
<i>the living cell...</i>

38:11.586 --> 38:15.113
<i>... a realm, in its own way,</i>
<i>as complex and beautiful...</i>

38:15.323 --> 38:18.292
<i>... as the realm of galaxies and stars.</i>

38:18.693 --> 38:21.685
<i>Among the red blood cells,</i>
<i>we encounter a white blood cell...</i>

38:21.896 --> 38:23.488
<i>... a lymphocyte...</i>

38:23.698 --> 38:26.667
<i>... whose job it is to protect me</i>
<i>against invading microbes.</i>

38:26.867 --> 38:29.802
<i>It makes antibodies</i>
<i>on its furrowed surface...</i>

38:30.004 --> 38:33.531
<i>... but its interior is</i>
<i>like that of many cells.</i>

38:35.476 --> 38:39.469
<i>Plunging through the membrane,</i>
<i>we find ourselves inside the cell.</i>

38:39.680 --> 38:43.343
<i>Here, every structure</i>
<i>has its function.</i>

38:46.187 --> 38:49.088
<i>These dark green blobs</i>
<i>are factories...</i>

38:49.290 --> 38:52.259
<i>... where messenger molecules</i>
<i>are busy building the enzymes...</i>

38:52.460 --> 38:54.758
<i>... which control</i>
<i>the chemistry of the cell.</i>

38:54.962 --> 38:58.056
<i>The messengers were</i>
<i>instructed and dispatched...</i>

38:58.265 --> 39:02.361
<i>... from within the nucleus,</i>
<i>the heart and brain of the cell.</i>

39:02.703 --> 39:05.228
<i>All the instructions on</i>
<i>how to get a cell to work...</i>

39:05.439 --> 39:08.340
<i>... and how to make another</i>
<i>are hidden away in there.</i>

39:08.542 --> 39:11.010
<i>We find a tunnel, a nuclear pore...</i>

39:11.212 --> 39:14.943
<i>... an approach to</i>
<i>the biological holy of holies.</i>

39:17.151 --> 39:22.088
<i>These necklaces, these intricately</i>
<i>looped and coiled strands...</i>

39:22.289 --> 39:24.849
<i>... are nucleic acids, DNA.</i>

39:26.394 --> 39:28.954
<i>Everything you need to know on</i>
<i>how to make a human being...</i>

39:29.163 --> 39:34.100
<i>... is encoded in the language</i>
<i>of life in the DNA molecule.</i>

39:41.642 --> 39:44.839
<i>This is the DNA double helix...</i>

39:45.046 --> 39:49.983
<i>... a machine with about 100 billion</i>
<i>moving parts, called atoms.</i>

39:50.918 --> 39:54.012
<i>There are as many atoms</i>
<i>in one molecule of DNA...</i>

39:54.221 --> 39:57.918
<i>... as there are stars</i>
<i>in a typical galaxy.</i>

40:02.263 --> 40:05.596
<i>The sequence of nucleotides,</i>
<i>here brightly colored...</i>

40:05.800 --> 40:08.792
<i>... is all that's passed on</i>
<i>from generation to generation.</i>

40:09.003 --> 40:11.233
<i>Change the order of the nucleotides...</i>

40:11.439 --> 40:14.499
<i>... and you change</i>
<i>the genetic instructions.</i>

40:21.982 --> 40:26.009
<i>DNA must replicate itself</i>
<i>with extreme fidelity.</i>

40:26.220 --> 40:30.816
<i>The reproduction of a DNA molecule</i>
<i>begins by separating the two helices.</i>

40:31.025 --> 40:34.984
<i>This is accomplished</i>
<i>by an unwinding enzyme.</i>

40:35.196 --> 40:39.189
<i>Like some precision tool,</i>
<i>this enzyme, shown in blue...</i>

40:39.400 --> 40:44.337
<i>... breaks the chemical bonds</i>
<i>that bind the two helices of DNA.</i>

40:44.972 --> 40:47.566
<i>The enzyme works its way</i>
<i>down the molecule...</i>

40:47.775 --> 40:51.040
<i>... unzipping DNA as it goes.</i>

40:53.647 --> 40:55.740
<i>Each helix copies the other...</i>

40:55.950 --> 40:59.147
<i>... supervised by special enzymes.</i>

40:59.353 --> 41:03.187
<i>The organic soup inside the nucleus</i>
<i>contains many free nucleotides.</i>

41:03.457 --> 41:08.394
<i>The enzyme recognizes an approaching</i>
<i>nucleotide and clicks it into place...</i>

41:08.696 --> 41:11.961
<i>... reproducing another rung</i>
<i>in the double helix.</i>

41:16.237 --> 41:18.865
<i>When the DNA is replicating</i>
<i>in one of your cells...</i>

41:19.073 --> 41:21.940
<i>... a few dozen nucleotides</i>
<i>are added every second.</i>

41:22.276 --> 41:26.679
<i>Thousands of these enzymes may be</i>
<i>working on a given DNA molecule.</i>

41:36.524 --> 41:39.288
<i>When an arriving nucleotide</i>
<i>doesn't fit...</i>

41:39.493 --> 41:41.552
<i>... the enzyme throws it away.</i>

41:41.762 --> 41:43.389
<i>We call this proofreading.</i>

41:43.597 --> 41:46.088
<i>On the rare occasions</i>
<i>of a proofreading error...</i>

41:46.300 --> 41:48.234
<i>... the wrong nucleotide is attached...</i>

41:48.435 --> 41:52.064
<i>... and a small random change has</i>
<i>been made in the genetic instructions.</i>

41:52.273 --> 41:54.639
<i>A mutation has occurred.</i>

41:56.177 --> 41:58.941
<i>This enzyme is a
<i>pretty small molecule...</i></i>

41:59.146 --> 42:02.138
<i>... but it catches nucleotides,</i>
<i>assembles them in the right order...</i>

42:02.349 --> 42:03.782
<i>... it knows how to proofread...</i>

42:03.984 --> 42:06.851
<i>... it's responsible</i>
<i>in the most fundamental way...</i>

42:07.054 --> 42:11.548
<i>... for the reproduction of every cell</i>
<i>and every being on Earth.</i>

42:16.997 --> 42:19.488
<i>That enzyme and DNA itself...</i>

42:19.700 --> 42:23.636
<i>... are molecular machines</i>
<i>with awesome powers.</i>

42:26.340 --> 42:29.901
<i>Within every living thing,</i>
<i>the molecular machines are busy...</i>

42:30.110 --> 42:34.706
<i>... making sure that nucleic acids</i>
<i>will continue to reproduce.</i>

42:55.636 --> 42:59.094
<i>A minor cut in my skin</i>
<i>sounds a local alarm...</i>

42:59.306 --> 43:03.174
<i>... and the blood spins</i>
<i>a complex net of strong fibers...</i>

43:03.377 --> 43:06.540
<i>... to form a clot</i>
<i>and staunch the flow of blood.</i>

43:06.747 --> 43:08.442
<i>There's a very delicate balance here:</i>

43:08.649 --> 43:11.777
<i>Too much clotting</i>
<i>and your blood stream will solidify.</i>

43:11.986 --> 43:16.116
<i>Too little clotting and you'll bleed</i>
<i>to death from the merest scratch.</i>

43:16.423 --> 43:21.360
<i>The balance is controlled</i>
<i>by enzymes instructed by DNA.</i>

43:23.998 --> 43:27.161
<i>Down here, there's also</i>
<i>a kind of sanitation squad...</i>

43:27.368 --> 43:30.633
<i>... comprised of white blood cells,</i>
<i>that swings into action...</i>

43:30.838 --> 43:35.468
<i>... surrounds invading bacteria</i>
<i>and ravenously consumes them.</i>

43:35.676 --> 43:38.839
<i>This mopping-up operation is</i>
<i>a part of the healing process...</i>

43:39.046 --> 43:42.038
<i>... again controlled by DNA.</i>

43:43.617 --> 43:47.747
<i>These cells are parts of us,</i>
<i>but how alien they seem.</i>

43:47.955 --> 43:50.583
<i>Within each of them,</i>
<i>within every cell...</i>

43:50.791 --> 43:53.817
<i>... there are exquisitely</i>
<i>evolved molecular machines.</i>

43:54.028 --> 43:57.589
<i>Nucleic acids, enzymes,</i>
<i>the cell architecture...</i>

43:57.798 --> 44:01.666
<i>... every cell is a triumph</i>
<i>of natural selection.</i>

44:01.869 --> 44:05.066
<i>And we're made of trillions of cells.</i>

44:05.272 --> 44:08.264
<i>We are, each of us, a multitude.</i>

44:09.877 --> 44:12.937
<i>Within us is a little universe.</i>

44:29.196 --> 44:34.133
Human DNA is a coiled ladder...

44:34.368 --> 44:36.632
...a billion nucleotides long.

44:37.171 --> 44:41.505
Many possible combinations of
nucleotides are nonsense. That is...

44:41.709 --> 44:46.078
...they translate into proteins which
serve no useful function whatever.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.511
Only a comparatively few
nucleic acid molecules...

44:49.717 --> 44:54.381
...are any good for life forms
as complicated as we are.

44:55.155 --> 44:59.353
But even so, the number of useful ways
of assembling nucleic acids...

44:59.560 --> 45:01.721
...is stupefyingly large.

45:01.929 --> 45:06.798
It's probably larger than the total
number of atoms in the universe.

45:07.001 --> 45:11.938
This means that the number of
possible kinds of human beings...

45:12.239 --> 45:16.869
...is vastly greater than the number
of human beings that has ever lived.

45:17.111 --> 45:21.343
This untapped potential of
the human species is immense.

45:21.548 --> 45:24.210
There are ways of
putting nucleic acids together...

45:24.418 --> 45:28.684
...which will function far better
by any criterion you wish to choose...

45:28.889 --> 45:33.826
...than the hereditary instructions of
any human being who has ever lived.

45:34.261 --> 45:38.721
Fortunately, we do not know,
or at least do not yet know...

45:38.932 --> 45:43.460
...how to assemble alternative
sequences of nucleotides...

45:43.670 --> 45:47.037
...to make alternative kinds
of human beings.

45:47.241 --> 45:50.768
In the future, we might be able
to put nucleotides together...

45:50.978 --> 45:52.707
...in any desired sequence...

45:52.913 --> 45:56.314
...to produce human characteristics
we think desirable.

45:57.317 --> 46:01.276
A disquieting and awesome prospect.

46:12.066 --> 46:16.230
We human beings don't look
very much like a tree.

46:16.437 --> 46:20.464
We certainly view the world
differently than a tree does.

46:20.674 --> 46:24.132
But down deep,
at the molecular heart of life...

46:24.344 --> 46:27.507
...we're essentially
identical to trees.

46:28.082 --> 46:32.951
We both use nucleic acids
as the hereditary material.

46:33.153 --> 46:38.056
We both use proteins as enzymes
to control the chemistry of the cell.

46:39.426 --> 46:43.954
And most significantly,
we both use the identical code book...

46:44.164 --> 46:49.067
...to translate nucleic acid information
into protein information.

46:49.269 --> 46:53.638
Any tree could read my genetic code.

46:54.575 --> 46:57.100
How did such astonishing similarities
come about?

46:57.311 --> 47:01.441
Why are we cousins to the trees?

47:01.648 --> 47:04.776
Would life on some other planet
use proteins?

47:04.985 --> 47:09.922
The same proteins? The same nucleic
acids? The same genetic code?

47:10.624 --> 47:13.457
The usual explanation
is that we are...

47:13.660 --> 47:17.221
...all of us, trees and people...

47:17.431 --> 47:22.266
...angler fish, slime molds,
bacteria...

47:22.469 --> 47:26.098
...all descended from a single
and common instance...

47:26.306 --> 47:29.173
...of the origin of life
4 billion years ago...

47:29.376 --> 47:31.537
...in the early days of our planet.

47:32.379 --> 47:34.176
Now, how...

47:34.381 --> 47:37.782
...did the molecules
of life arise?

47:39.353 --> 47:40.718
(THUNDER)

(LIGHTNING BUZZES)

47:56.136 --> 47:58.434
<i>In a laboratory</i>
<i>at Cornell University...</i>

47:58.872 --> 48:02.501
<i>... we mix together the gases</i>
<i>and waters of the primitive Earth...</i>

48:02.709 --> 48:04.142
<i>... supply some energy...</i>

48:04.344 --> 48:07.939
<i>... and see if we can make</i>
<i>the stuff of life.</i>

48:20.561 --> 48:24.793
<i>But what was the early atmosphere</i>
<i>made of, ordinary air?</i>

48:24.998 --> 48:27.023
<i>If we start with</i>
<i>our present atmosphere...</i>

48:27.234 --> 48:29.634
<i>... the experiment is a dismal failure.</i>

48:29.836 --> 48:32.634
<i>Instead of making proteins</i>
<i>and nucleic acids...</i>

48:32.839 --> 48:36.240
<i>... all we make is smog,</i>
<i>a backwards step.</i>

48:36.443 --> 48:38.502
<i>Why doesn't such an experiment work?</i>

48:38.712 --> 48:42.273
<i>Because the air of today</i>
<i>contains molecular oxygen.</i>

48:42.482 --> 48:44.780
<i>But oxygen is made by plants.</i>

48:44.985 --> 48:48.614
<i>It's obvious that there were</i>
<i>no plants before the origin of life.</i>

48:48.822 --> 48:51.052
<i>We mustn't use oxygen</i>
<i>in our experiments...</i>

48:51.258 --> 48:54.125
<i>... because there wasn't any</i>
<i>in the early atmosphere.</i>

48:59.433 --> 49:03.665
<i>This is reasonable because the cosmos</i>
<i>is made mostly of hydrogen...</i>

49:03.870 --> 49:05.337
<i>... which gobbles oxygen up.</i>

49:05.539 --> 49:09.635
<i>The Earth's low gravity has</i>
<i>allowed most of our hydrogen gas...</i>

49:09.843 --> 49:13.540
<i>... to trickle away to space.</i>
<i>There's almost none left.</i>

49:14.514 --> 49:15.947
<i>But 4 billion years ago...</i>

49:16.149 --> 49:19.209
<i>... our atmosphere was full</i>
<i>of hydrogen-rich gases:</i>

49:19.419 --> 49:21.910
<i>Methane, ammonia, water vapor.</i>

49:22.122 --> 49:24.590
<i>These are the gases we should use.</i>

49:29.563 --> 49:32.532

<i>the purity of these gases...</i>

<i>... my colleague, Bishun Khare,</i>
<i>pumps them from their holding flasks.</i>

49:50.751 --> 49:53.447
<i>An experiment like this</i>
<i>was first performed...</i>

49:53.654 --> 49:57.681

<i>and Harold Urey in the 1950s.</i>

(GASES FIZZLE)

50:13.707 --> 50:18.303
<i>The starting gases are now introduced</i>
<i>into a large reaction vessel.</i>

50:18.512 --> 50:22.710
<i>We could shine ultraviolet light,</i>
<i>simulating the early sun.</i>

50:22.916 --> 50:24.281
<i>But in this experiment...</i>

50:24.518 --> 50:26.782
<i>... the gases will be sparked...</i>

50:26.987 --> 50:30.923
<i>... as the primitive atmosphere was</i>

50:51.611 --> 50:56.071
<i>After only a few hours,</i>
<i>the interior of the reaction vessel...</i>

50:56.283 --> 50:59.411
<i>... becomes streaked with</i>
<i>a strange brown pigment...</i>

50:59.619 --> 51:03.146
<i>... a rich collection</i>
<i>of complex organic molecules...</i>

51:03.357 --> 51:07.919
<i>... including the building blocks of</i>
<i>the proteins and the nucleic acids.</i>

51:10.130 --> 51:13.759
<i>Under the right conditions, these</i>
<i>building blocks assemble themselves...</i>

51:13.967 --> 51:18.427
<i>... into molecules resembling little</i>
<i>proteins and little nucleic acids.</i>

51:18.638 --> 51:23.166
<i>These nucleic acids can even make</i>
<i>identical copies of themselves.</i>

51:28.615 --> 51:33.018
<i>In this vessel are the notes</i>
<i>of the music of life...</i>

51:33.220 --> 51:36.087
<i>... although not yet the music itself.</i>

51:38.625 --> 51:41.059
Now, no one, so far...

51:41.261 --> 51:45.630
...has mixed together the gases
and waters of the primitive Earth...

51:45.832 --> 51:50.769
...and at the end of the experiment
had something crawl out of the flask.

51:51.004 --> 51:54.633
There's still much to be understood
about the origin of life...

51:54.841 --> 51:57.173
...including the origin
of the genetic code.

51:57.377 --> 52:00.835
But we've only been at
such experiments for 30 years.

52:01.047 --> 52:04.346
Nature's had
a 4-billion-year head start.

52:04.551 --> 52:09.147
Incidentally, there's nothing in such
experiments that's unique to the Earth.

52:09.356 --> 52:12.951
The gases we start with,
the energy sources we use...

52:13.160 --> 52:15.890
...are entirely common
through the cosmos.

52:16.096 --> 52:20.624
So chemical reactions something like
these must be responsible for...

52:20.834 --> 52:22.995
...the organic matter
in interstellar space...

52:23.203 --> 52:25.569
...and the amino acids
in the meteorites.

52:25.772 --> 52:28.605
Similar chemical reactions
must have occurred...

52:28.809 --> 52:32.245
...on a billion other worlds
in the Milky Way galaxy.

52:32.446 --> 52:36.405
Look how easy it is to make
great globs of this stuff.

52:36.616 --> 52:40.882
The molecules of life fill the cosmos.

52:41.488 --> 52:42.546
Now...

52:43.089 --> 52:45.922
What would life elsewhere look like?

52:46.126 --> 52:50.119
Even if it had an identical molecular
chemistry to life on Earth...

52:50.330 --> 52:52.161
...which I very much doubt...

52:52.365 --> 52:55.926
...it could not be
very similar in form...

52:56.136 --> 52:58.400
...to familiar organisms on the Earth.

52:58.605 --> 53:01.768
The random character of
the evolutionary process...

53:01.975 --> 53:06.810
...must create elsewhere creatures
very different from any that we know.

53:08.582 --> 53:11.210
<i>Think of a world</i>
<i>something like Jupiter...</i>

53:11.418 --> 53:15.980
<i>... with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen,</i>
<i>helium, methane, water and ammonia...</i>

53:16.189 --> 53:17.850
<i>... in which organic molecules</i>
<i>might be...</i>

53:18.058 --> 53:20.788
<i>... falling from the skies</i>
<i>like manna from heaven...</i>

53:20.994 --> 53:23.554
<i>... like the products of</i>
<i>the Miller-Urey experiment.</i>

53:23.763 --> 53:26.254
<i>Could there be life on such a world?</i>

53:27.200 --> 53:30.761
<i>There's a special problem.</i>
<i>The atmosphere is turbulent...</i>

53:30.971 --> 53:34.600
<i>... and down deep, before we ever</i>
<i>come to a surface, it's very hot.</i>

53:34.808 --> 53:38.471
<i>If you're not careful,</i>
<i>you'll be carried down and fried.</i>

53:38.678 --> 53:41.511
<i>If you reproduce</i>
<i>before you're fried...</i>

53:41.715 --> 53:46.414
<i>... turbulence will carry your offspring</i>
<i>into the higher and cooler layers.</i>

53:46.620 --> 53:51.319
<i>Such organisms could be very little.</i>
<i>We call them sinkers.</i>

53:52.759 --> 53:55.887
<i>The physicist E.E. Salpeter and I
<i>at Cornell...</i></i>

53:56.096 --> 53:58.690
<i>... have calculated</i>
<i>something about the life...</i>

53:58.899 --> 54:01.390
<i>... that might exist on such a world.</i>

54:03.436 --> 54:06.701
<i>Vast living balloons could</i>
<i>stay buoyant...</i>

54:06.907 --> 54:10.070
<i>... by pumping heavy gases</i>
<i>from their interiors...</i>

54:10.277 --> 54:12.268
<i>... or by keeping their insides warm.</i>

54:12.479 --> 54:15.209
<i>They might eat the organic molecules</i>
<i>in the air...</i>

54:15.415 --> 54:17.280
<i>... or make their own with sunlight.</i>

54:17.484 --> 54:20.817
<i>We call these creatures floaters.</i>

54:22.489 --> 54:24.855
<i>We imagine floaters</i>
<i>kilometers across...</i>

54:25.058 --> 54:28.494
<i>... enormously larger than</i>
<i>the greatest whale that ever was...</i>

54:28.695 --> 54:32.096
<i>... beings the size of cities.</i>

54:32.299 --> 54:36.201
<i>We conceive of them arrayed</i>
<i>in great, lazy herds...</i>

54:36.403 --> 54:38.234
<i>... as far as the eye can see...</i>

54:38.438 --> 54:43.137
<i>... concentrated in the updrafts</i>
<i>in the enormous sea of clouds.</i>

54:43.343 --> 54:47.609
<i>But there can be other creatures</i>
<i>in this alien environment: hunters.</i>

54:49.482 --> 54:51.643
<i>Hunters are fast and maneuverable.</i>

54:51.851 --> 54:55.150
<i>They eat the floaters,</i>
<i>both for their organic molecules...</i>

54:55.355 --> 54:57.448
<i>... and for their store</i>
<i>of pure hydrogen.</i>

54:57.657 --> 54:59.352
<i>But there can't be many hunters...</i>

54:59.559 --> 55:04.223
<i>... because if they destroy all the</i>
<i>floaters, they themselves will perish.</i>

55:07.767 --> 55:10.895
<i>Physics and chemistry permit</i>
<i>such life forms.</i>

55:11.104 --> 55:13.572
Art presents them with
a certain reality...

55:13.773 --> 55:17.436
...but nature is not obliged
to follow our speculations.

55:17.644 --> 55:22.240
If there are billions of inhabited
worlds in the Milky Way galaxy...

55:22.682 --> 55:27.176
...then I think it's likely there are
a few places which might have...

55:27.387 --> 55:28.786
...hunters...

55:28.989 --> 55:31.787
...and floaters and sinkers.

55:33.026 --> 55:37.258
Biology is more like history
than it is like physics.

55:37.464 --> 55:40.524
You have to know the past
to understand the present.

55:40.734 --> 55:44.898
<i>There is no predictive theory of</i>
<i>biology, nor is there for history.</i>

55:45.105 --> 55:46.470
<i>The reason is the same:</i>

55:46.673 --> 55:50.006
<i>Both subjects are still</i>
<i>too complicated for us.</i>

55:50.210 --> 55:52.838
<i>But we can understand ourselves</i>
<i>much better...</i>

55:53.046 --> 55:55.276
<i>... by understanding other cases.</i>

55:56.950 --> 56:00.408
<i>The study of a single instance</i>
<i>of extraterrestrial life...</i>

56:00.620 --> 56:04.112
<i>No matter how humble,</i>
<i>a microbe would be just fine.</i>

56:04.324 --> 56:07.259
<i>- will de-provincialize biology.</i>

56:07.460 --> 56:11.055
<i>It will show us what else is possible.</i>

56:12.532 --> 56:17.469
<i>We've heard so far the voice</i>
<i>of life on only a single world...</i>

56:17.704 --> 56:20.070
<i>... but for the first time,</i>
<i>as we shall see...</i>

56:20.273 --> 56:23.731
<i>... we've begun</i>
<i>a serious scientific search...</i>

56:23.943 --> 56:26.173
<i>... for the cosmic fugue.</i>

56:36.389 --> 56:39.654
Recently, we've learned more
about the origin of life.

56:39.859 --> 56:41.986
<i>Do you remember RNA...</i>

56:42.195 --> 56:45.562
<i>... that nucleic acid</i>
<i>that our cells use as messengers...</i>

56:45.765 --> 56:48.893
<i>... carrying the genetic information</i>
<i>out of the cell nucleus?</i>

56:49.569 --> 56:53.801
Well, it's been found that RNA,
like protein...

56:54.007 --> 56:56.271
...can control chemical reactions...

56:56.476 --> 57:00.139
...as well as reproduce itself,
which proteins can't do.

57:00.346 --> 57:03.577
Many scientists now wonder
if the first life on Earth...

57:03.783 --> 57:05.944
...was an RNA molecule.

57:06.152 --> 57:09.610
It now seems feasible that
key molecular building blocks...

57:09.823 --> 57:13.759
...for the origin of life, fell out
of the skies 4 billion years ago.

57:14.527 --> 57:18.930
<i>Comets have been found to have a lot</i>
<i>of organic molecules in them...</i>

57:19.132 --> 57:23.466
<i>... and they fell in huge numbers</i>
<i>on the primitive Earth.</i>

57:24.571 --> 57:27.404
We also mention the extinction
of the dinosaurs...

57:27.607 --> 57:31.543
...and most of the other species on
Earth about 65 million years ago.

57:31.745 --> 57:35.909
<i>We now know that a large comet</i>
<i>hit the Earth at just that time.</i>

57:36.116 --> 57:41.053
<i>The dust pall from that collision</i>
<i>must've cooled and darkened the Earth...</i>

57:41.387 --> 57:44.322
<i>... perhaps killing all</i>
<i>the dinosaurs, but sparing...</i>

57:44.524 --> 57:48.984
<i>... the small, furry mammals</i>
<i>who were our ancestors.</i>

57:49.195 --> 57:53.063
Other cometary mass extinctions
in other epochs seem likely.

57:53.266 --> 57:57.600
If true, this would mean that
comets have been the bringers...

57:57.804 --> 58:00.272
...both of life and death.
