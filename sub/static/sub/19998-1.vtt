WEBVTT

01:29.456 --> 01:30.888
Five minutes.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.672
Have you ever been involved
with any political organization

03:34.674 --> 03:38.105
Or group of people whose activities
are political in nature?

03:38.107 --> 03:40.171
No, sir.

03:40.173 --> 03:41.436
In the last seven years,

03:41.438 --> 03:43.436
Have you consulted with
a health care professional

03:43.438 --> 03:46.069
Regarding an emotional
or mental health condition?

03:46.071 --> 03:47.568
No, sir.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.600
Prior to prisons, has the government
ever investigated your background

03:51.602 --> 03:53.900
Or given you
a security clearance?

03:53.902 --> 03:56.165
Yes, sir.
I was an army regular.

03:58.465 --> 04:01.897
What was your clearance level?
Cat 2, confidential.

04:06.530 --> 04:08.495
How long
have you been with prisons?

04:08.963 --> 04:10.228
Two years.

04:11.394 --> 04:13.259
Always technical workshop?

04:14.194 --> 04:15.525
Yes, sir.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.891
Larangan is different
from commonwealth.

04:21.091 --> 04:24.290
We're a maximum security prison.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.623
- Have you been here before?
<i>- No, sir.</i>

04:28.890 --> 04:30.321
Why'd you join prisons?

04:30.323 --> 04:33.854
<i>I wanted to help
those who want to change...</i>

04:34.955 --> 04:36.886
And make them better people.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.484
You'll be handling
rehab prisoners.

04:41.486 --> 04:44.650
But here,
we also have punishment cells

04:44.652 --> 04:46.316
And condemned cells.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.315
You're aware of that?

04:48.916 --> 04:50.214
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

04:59.615 --> 05:03.380
Your cat 2a clearance will give
you access to blocks a to d.

05:03.382 --> 05:06.980
But the maximum security side
at block e is out-of-bounds.

05:06.982 --> 05:09.346
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.

05:10.513 --> 05:12.245
Here's your new security pass.

05:12.247 --> 05:15.778
Put your full name here,
your id, and sign here.

05:18.512 --> 05:19.751
Up!

05:20.778 --> 05:21.937
Let's go.

05:55.308 --> 05:58.040
Aiman! I need
to get something. Open quick!

05:58.042 --> 05:59.305
Wait!

05:59.307 --> 06:01.738
I need the spray.
There's a cockroach.

06:01.740 --> 06:03.004
Just whack it!

06:03.006 --> 06:06.369
The cockroach is the flying type.
What are you doing?

06:07.770 --> 06:08.869
Quick!

06:10.669 --> 06:13.934
What are you looking at?
Why are you so shy?

06:13.936 --> 06:16.173
You can't tell
I'm on the toilet?

06:18.233 --> 06:20.465
Quick!

06:23.599 --> 06:26.330
Grandma told me
her stomach is hurting again.

06:27.431 --> 06:29.463
When was her last checkup?

06:29.465 --> 06:33.362
Last month, but they've
scheduled another appointment.

06:33.364 --> 06:36.161
Can you take shorter showers?

06:36.163 --> 06:40.327
Our bills have gone up
by quite a lot.

06:40.329 --> 06:44.793
Just because you can afford it now
doesn't mean you should be wasteful.

06:44.795 --> 06:49.025
It's a good thing grandma isn't here.
She'd make you bathe with a bucket.

06:49.027 --> 06:50.190
Understand?

06:50.558 --> 06:51.757
Okay.

06:52.758 --> 06:53.822
Tastes good?

06:56.155 --> 06:57.454
It's okay.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.686
Hey,
wear your shoe properly first.

07:41.688 --> 07:43.318
Wear your shoe properly.

07:47.218 --> 07:49.383
Hey, it's you again!

08:07.016 --> 08:09.381
Hey, inmate!
Don't use your hand.

08:10.682 --> 08:11.714
Use the pliers.

08:12.815 --> 08:15.280
If your hand
gets stuck, then what?

08:15.914 --> 08:17.345
Understand?

08:17.347 --> 08:18.845
Understood.

08:24.111 --> 08:26.410
Joseph always goes there.
You know Joseph?

08:26.412 --> 08:29.843
- I know.
- Speaking of Joseph.

08:29.845 --> 08:33.808
I've told him, just let
them order what they want.

08:33.809 --> 08:37.407
- Comfort food.
- Last meal?

08:37.409 --> 08:40.740
Last meal, you know.
Just let them be happy, right?

08:40.741 --> 08:45.839
We need to fatten them up. Too
light and they won't go down.

08:47.207 --> 08:49.271
Yeah, he can be
a little thick sometimes.

08:49.273 --> 08:54.771
I don't know what goes on in his head.
He never gets it right.

09:25.036 --> 09:26.301
What's this?

09:27.335 --> 09:29.334
The cabinet door fell off.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.567
So dangerous.
It narrowly missed my feet.

09:37.601 --> 09:41.432
Do you remember? How you used
to hide in that cabinet?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.498
Funny,

09:45.500 --> 09:48.431
You managed to fit in there
even when you were fat.

09:48.433 --> 09:50.898
Hey.
When was I ever fat?

09:57.063 --> 10:00.195
You remember
those Popeye stickers?

10:00.197 --> 10:01.662
You used to sing...

10:02.496 --> 10:05.961
Papa the sailor man! Choo-choo!

10:05.963 --> 10:09.494
I tried to tell you it's Popeye,
but you kept going "papa."

10:09.496 --> 10:11.360
It made grandma so upset.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.392
I'll look
for a new cabinet this weekend.

10:28.025 --> 10:31.290
I can fix it.
Just get a new one.

10:31.292 --> 10:32.823
This one's so old anyway.

10:32.825 --> 10:35.722
Don't worry, I can fix it.

10:45.954 --> 10:49.420
I don't care what management says.
Tell them what I said.

12:14.581 --> 12:15.879
Up!

12:15.881 --> 12:17.912
Let's go.

12:30.977 --> 12:32.576
Where are you going?

12:32.578 --> 12:33.709
Meeting john.

12:37.109 --> 12:39.641
What time are you coming back?
Late.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.806
What time is late?

12:42.808 --> 12:44.506
Do I have a curfew now?

12:45.806 --> 12:47.771
I'm asking, that's all.

12:47.773 --> 12:50.505
Late means late.

12:50.507 --> 12:53.237
You mind your business
and I'll do the same, okay?

12:54.238 --> 12:55.803
What's that supposed to mean?

12:57.437 --> 13:00.768
You know I don't like you working in
that prison, but I don't say anything.

13:02.469 --> 13:04.747
What does this have
to do with the prison?

13:09.133 --> 13:10.365
Hi.

13:11.566 --> 13:12.931
One moment, john.

13:22.931 --> 13:26.568
Did I interrupt something? No, it's okay.
Come, let's go.

13:59.629 --> 14:03.460
- Return this for me.
- Yes, chief.

14:03.462 --> 14:07.192
Go pack up block e.
Get someone to help you.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.525
Yes, chief.

14:09.527 --> 14:13.823
Chief Rahim borrowed this that day.
Are the other guys around?

14:13.825 --> 14:15.356
They went for lunch.

14:20.322 --> 14:21.687
Do you need help?

15:03.053 --> 15:06.218
Come, lift this with me.
One, two, three!

15:08.985 --> 15:10.250
Push the trolley.

15:14.417 --> 15:17.382
This one's spoiled?
Something inside's broken.

15:31.315 --> 15:34.479
- I think I can fix this.
- We've tried already.

15:35.446 --> 15:37.511
Come.
There's some more.

15:39.144 --> 15:41.309
These two also go
into that room.

15:42.343 --> 15:44.408
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

17:12.762 --> 17:14.295
Joseph!

17:14.297 --> 17:15.594
Yes, chief!

17:30.294 --> 17:33.393
- Did you call them or not?
- Yeah, they only have one inch.

17:33.395 --> 17:36.393
Why you never checked earlier?

17:36.395 --> 17:38.712
I didn't know ah Tiong's
not working there anymore.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.424
Did you try other suppliers?

17:43.426 --> 17:45.390
Yeah, I called a few.

17:45.392 --> 17:48.555
But they also don't have
three-quarter inch.

17:48.557 --> 17:51.988
I asked you to go down last week.
You go down or not?

17:51.990 --> 17:56.387
Not yet, chief. I thought it
was better to call them first.

17:56.389 --> 18:00.319
What about beach road?
The fishing shops there?

18:01.086 --> 18:02.651
I don't know those, chief.

18:07.951 --> 18:09.317
I know somewhere.

18:13.151 --> 18:15.482
- Like fishing shops?
- No, chief.

18:15.484 --> 18:18.249
It's like a warehouse,
for boatmen.

18:18.251 --> 18:20.881
At Sembawang.

18:20.883 --> 18:22.314
Do they have these?

18:24.214 --> 18:26.112
We can give it a try.

18:30.313 --> 18:32.844
You're one of Sabir's new guys?
Yes, chief.

18:32.846 --> 18:36.211
How do you know of this place?

18:36.213 --> 18:38.211
My grandfather was a boatman.

18:38.213 --> 18:41.609
He used to take me there.

18:43.210 --> 18:46.275
Joseph said
you can fix the scale?

18:48.075 --> 18:51.307
I can try. Shouldn't be tough.

18:52.207 --> 18:54.206
You're a mechanic?

18:54.208 --> 18:57.738
No. I went to the vocational
training institute.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.737
What did you do before
joining the service?

19:02.604 --> 19:03.736
I was in the army.

19:04.570 --> 19:07.169
Regular?
Yes.

19:09.236 --> 19:10.701
What was your vocation?

19:11.535 --> 19:12.534
Guards.

19:16.933 --> 19:21.198
We don't get a lot of guys
like you, from the army.

19:22.265 --> 19:25.696
Most guys come straight
out of school.

19:25.698 --> 19:30.362
Nowadays, no one is tough
enough for a job like this.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.628
Those scholar types
just don't get it,

19:33.630 --> 19:36.295
Always hiding behind
all the fucking rules.

19:43.061 --> 19:44.525
You see that tree?

19:47.026 --> 19:48.791
Know what tree that is?

19:53.591 --> 19:55.923
White people call it
a "ceme-tree."

19:59.291 --> 20:02.290
You're a serious guy,
aren't you?

20:11.190 --> 20:14.954
The size doesn't really matter.
I can reduce one strand.

20:16.554 --> 20:18.385
This the last roll I have.

20:20.919 --> 20:22.784
Yes, this is good.

20:25.551 --> 20:28.383
And then this one?
What is this?

20:28.385 --> 20:31.217
That one is hemp rope.
Different from manila.

20:31.219 --> 20:33.616
But that one,
I don't have three-quarter inch.

20:33.618 --> 20:37.095
What do you need the rope for?
Some maintenance work.

20:53.379 --> 20:54.444
Sis?

21:02.478 --> 21:03.509
Sis?

21:07.810 --> 21:08.909
Fuck!

21:33.410 --> 21:36.541
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to knock?

21:46.009 --> 21:47.674
I found this the other day.

21:54.307 --> 21:57.239
He wants me to meet
his parents in Australia.

22:07.606 --> 22:08.771
I met him.

22:10.471 --> 22:11.503
Who?

22:13.071 --> 22:14.369
The hangman.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.267
What?

22:26.301 --> 22:28.366
The same man
who hanged our father?

22:35.433 --> 22:37.831
He's been doing it
for over 30 years.

22:55.664 --> 22:56.929
He told you that?

22:58.229 --> 23:01.528
- What? -That he's been
doing it for 30 years.

23:04.128 --> 23:05.694
He was in the papers.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.226
I recognized his face.

23:09.393 --> 23:11.951
Does he know who you are?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.257
Did you tell him?

23:17.658 --> 23:19.223
Did you tell John?

23:54.457 --> 23:57.155
Aiman! Chief Rahim's
looking for you.

24:20.054 --> 24:22.853
- I'll be next door if you need me.
- Okay, chief.

24:53.218 --> 24:55.383
I need to redo the noose.

25:00.650 --> 25:02.382
Come help me.

25:02.384 --> 25:05.482
Go downstairs.
Remove the sandbag.

25:22.816 --> 25:25.781
Loosen it.
And take that off.

25:28.848 --> 25:32.213
There are three in all.
See the one at the bottom?

25:32.215 --> 25:34.246
Hold and twist.

25:41.513 --> 25:42.712
Thanks, chief.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.143
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

25:50.645 --> 25:51.644
How come?

25:55.309 --> 25:56.874
Broke up a while back.

25:58.407 --> 26:00.485
No chance to meet anyone new.

26:03.873 --> 26:05.204
Any girl to introduce?

26:07.706 --> 26:09.904
No luck myself.

26:10.804 --> 26:12.202
You're not married?

26:12.870 --> 26:15.334
Once. For four years.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.832
She didn't know
I was an executioner.

26:21.998 --> 26:24.664
She didn't know?

26:24.666 --> 26:29.596
She knew I was working in prisons.
But she didn't know I hanged people.

26:29.598 --> 26:33.228
One day I told her. She couldn't
accept it, so she left me.

26:35.562 --> 26:36.627
When was that?

26:37.761 --> 26:38.760
A long time ago.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.725
When I was about your age.

26:46.525 --> 26:48.883
Do you remember
the people you hang?

26:51.690 --> 26:52.888
Some of them.

26:54.189 --> 26:56.588
Especially those
under my charge.

27:00.321 --> 27:03.719
You talk to them?
Sometimes.

27:06.586 --> 27:08.351
Are they usually...

27:09.151 --> 27:10.916
Repentant?

27:10.918 --> 27:13.383
Some of them.

27:13.385 --> 27:17.316
They ask for forgiveness.
They start praying.

27:21.616 --> 27:22.848
What happened there?

27:27.947 --> 27:29.912
Gang fight.

27:29.914 --> 27:31.445
When I was 17.

27:32.612 --> 27:33.744
What happened?

27:34.877 --> 27:37.109
The fella slashed me twice.

27:38.009 --> 27:41.307
Over what?
He was staring at me.

27:41.907 --> 27:43.472
So I stared back.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.471
Something stupid like that.

27:49.672 --> 27:53.169
I had a lot of anger in me.
A bad temper.

27:54.303 --> 27:56.301
So I joined gangs.

27:57.735 --> 27:59.433
And the army?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.699
During national service,

28:02.701 --> 28:03.964
I changed.

28:03.966 --> 28:08.431
Not sure why... Maybe it was
the discipline in the army.

28:09.665 --> 28:11.863
So I signed on.

28:11.865 --> 28:12.996
Why did you leave?

28:12.998 --> 28:15.895
My officer didn't like me.

28:15.897 --> 28:16.896
How come?

28:17.730 --> 28:20.261
Scholars. Fuck them.

28:23.595 --> 28:26.393
So after I finished my bond,
I joined the prison service.

28:32.859 --> 28:35.358
I thought it would be similar.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.957
How? Is it similar?

28:38.857 --> 28:40.256
The discipline part, yes.

28:40.258 --> 28:43.988
It's good that I joined prisons.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.188
I can relate to the inmates.

28:50.688 --> 28:54.952
The way I was before, I could easily
have been the one behind bars.

28:58.053 --> 29:00.619
Everyone makes mistakes.

29:00.621 --> 29:02.884
Some people own up to them,
some don't.

29:02.886 --> 29:06.450
What's important
is to face the consequences.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.382
You remind me
of when I was younger.

29:12.149 --> 29:14.248
Me?
Yeah.

29:14.250 --> 29:17.114
You have principles.

29:17.116 --> 29:20.180
People with principles
make good leaders.

29:20.182 --> 29:23.879
Unlike those
who hide behind rules.

29:23.881 --> 29:26.346
They are just followers.

29:44.212 --> 29:45.611
I went to see grandma.

29:46.612 --> 29:49.277
She asked
if you are seeing anyone.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.609
Nope.

29:51.611 --> 29:54.441
What about the girl that time?
What's her name?

29:57.241 --> 29:58.640
Why are you asking?

30:00.440 --> 30:03.871
Just asking. We haven't discussed
these things in a while.

30:05.072 --> 30:07.870
You don't seem
to go out anymore.

30:09.104 --> 30:11.503
You don't have
to worry about me.

30:12.803 --> 30:16.002
You're always cooped up
at home or at work.

30:16.004 --> 30:17.369
It's not normal, okay?

30:20.768 --> 30:22.267
I'm fine.

30:22.867 --> 30:24.233
Seriously.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.265
If you want to take a break,

30:33.267 --> 30:37.231
John said you can join us
on a holiday to Sydney.

30:45.264 --> 30:48.229
I... Can't take leave.

30:52.263 --> 30:54.362
What's your problem with John?

30:55.396 --> 30:56.894
I don't have a problem.

33:49.116 --> 33:50.381
What's wrong?

33:56.047 --> 33:57.745
Tomorrow there's one execution.

34:00.279 --> 34:02.211
Chief wants me to conduct it.

34:55.701 --> 34:56.900
Ma!

35:30.362 --> 35:33.227
Sir.
Aiman. Come, have a seat.

35:36.294 --> 35:38.825
I'm just looking
through your security forms.

35:38.827 --> 35:43.491
It says here your father's name
is Ibrahim bin Fazril.

35:47.491 --> 35:50.589
So, how come
your surname is Yusof?

35:52.990 --> 35:55.755
I grew up as an orphan, sir.

35:55.757 --> 35:59.021
My grandparents became
my legal guardians.

35:59.023 --> 36:02.820
So... Ibrahim Fazril
is my grandfather.

36:03.587 --> 36:05.053
I see.

36:05.055 --> 36:07.552
Is he your paternal
or maternal grandfather?

36:07.554 --> 36:08.585
Paternal.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.885
I just need you to verify everything
and then sign at the bottom.

36:17.952 --> 36:21.616
- What's this for, sir?
- It's just a security procedure.

36:22.817 --> 36:26.016
So your biological father's name

36:26.018 --> 36:28.848
Would be Yusof Ibrahim?

36:29.582 --> 36:30.741
Yes, sir.

36:31.849 --> 36:34.646
Sir, security department
is asking for the report.

36:36.647 --> 36:38.213
It's nearly done.

36:38.215 --> 36:40.612
I'll send it to you.
Okay, sir.

36:43.479 --> 36:47.044
- Chief clerk called you in just now?
- Yes.

36:47.046 --> 36:48.676
What did he ask you?

36:48.678 --> 36:51.555
Nothing much, he just went
through a form with me.

37:01.076 --> 37:03.440
Joseph asked
to be transferred out.

37:05.241 --> 37:08.173
I want you to take
over as my assistant.

37:12.406 --> 37:14.738
What about the other guys?

37:14.740 --> 37:17.370
They've been here longer
than me, chief.

37:17.372 --> 37:19.450
There's no one else suitable.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.835
You've been doing well.

37:33.202 --> 37:34.700
Learn the ropes, yeah?

37:46.667 --> 37:49.332
The length of the drop
is very important.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.531
But it's all common sense.

37:52.865 --> 37:55.330
Look at the chart.

37:55.332 --> 37:58.862
If the guy is 189 pounds,
how long should the drop be?

38:00.663 --> 38:03.261
168 centimeters.

38:03.829 --> 38:05.527
140 pounds?

38:07.728 --> 38:09.926
215 centimeters.

38:11.393 --> 38:14.192
The idea is simple.

38:14.194 --> 38:17.524
We need enough pressure
to fracture his spine.

38:17.526 --> 38:20.690
If the drop is too short, the guy
would be strangled to death.

38:21.357 --> 38:23.189
If it's too long...

38:24.991 --> 38:30.055
My job is to make sure
he dies instantly.

38:30.057 --> 38:31.653
Make sure there's no pain.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.385
In some countries...

38:36.419 --> 38:38.551
They use the short drop.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.349
It's pitiful, you know.
The guy really suffers.

38:43.249 --> 38:46.748
They'll let him struggle
for 30 minutes

38:46.750 --> 38:50.647
Until he turns blue and soils
his pants before he dies.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.646
But here...

38:54.780 --> 38:56.411
We are humane.

38:57.945 --> 39:00.777
We make sure it is
quick and painless.

39:03.744 --> 39:06.509
The perfect job

39:06.511 --> 39:11.075
Is when we fracture between the
second and third vertebrae.

39:11.077 --> 39:12.908
This spot here.
Can you feel it?

39:12.910 --> 39:14.540
Mmm.

39:14.542 --> 39:17.906
When he drops,
you will hear a "crack!"

39:19.940 --> 39:21.438
And that's it.

39:22.006 --> 39:23.437
He stops moving.

39:24.638 --> 39:25.917
His heart stops.

39:26.670 --> 39:27.902
Everything stops.

39:29.003 --> 39:31.240
His soul is gone,
just like that.

39:32.135 --> 39:34.453
The score for that?
Ten out of ten.

39:35.900 --> 39:37.230
The trick is...

39:39.931 --> 39:41.362
To place the knot...

39:45.663 --> 39:48.795
Just beside the left ear
above the jaw.

39:48.797 --> 39:49.895
So the force hits...

39:50.729 --> 39:51.968
Just like that.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.392
You'll see this Friday.

40:01.393 --> 40:02.791
Okay, let's pack up.

40:13.155 --> 40:14.687
Chief,

40:14.689 --> 40:17.820
Do you have the keys
to the archive cabinet?

40:17.822 --> 40:19.753
I'll return the file.

40:19.755 --> 40:23.753
Just leave it at the registry.
They'll know what to do.

40:44.519 --> 40:45.851
There.

40:45.853 --> 40:48.250
Never mind, chief.
Take it.

40:48.252 --> 40:50.383
Never mind.
Take it.

40:50.385 --> 40:54.716
How much is the food?
Don't worry about it. Just eat.

40:54.718 --> 40:56.615
For real?
Eat.

41:01.581 --> 41:04.046
You're sure you can fix the scale?
Yeah.

41:04.048 --> 41:05.446
Good.

41:05.448 --> 41:08.446
Actually I can usually
tell just by looking

41:08.448 --> 41:10.412
How much a person weighs.

41:11.179 --> 41:12.344
Really?

41:13.578 --> 41:15.810
You are 158

41:15.812 --> 41:17.976
To 159 pounds?

41:17.978 --> 41:19.208
About 72 kilos.

41:22.509 --> 41:23.841
More or less.

41:23.843 --> 41:27.173
Go measure yourself. Then
tell me if it's more or less.

42:02.735 --> 42:03.867
Chief.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.198
How is he?
He's been eating well these two days.

42:34.297 --> 42:36.396
- Morning, randy.
- Morning, sir.

42:38.063 --> 42:40.295
Ask the cookhouse
to stick to the meal plan.

42:40.297 --> 42:41.961
Yes, chief.
Did his family come today?

42:41.963 --> 42:45.461
No, no one came. We tried
calling, but no one came.

42:49.895 --> 42:51.293
Aiman.

42:54.494 --> 42:55.860
That's a pinion.

42:56.861 --> 42:58.759
We use that to tie the legs.

43:01.159 --> 43:03.258
What if he can't stand up?

43:03.260 --> 43:06.324
We let him sit on the chair.

43:06.326 --> 43:09.189
We put on the hood
so they don't see the noose.

43:10.156 --> 43:11.622
But usually they're okay.

43:11.624 --> 43:14.921
By the time they get here,
they've accepted their fate.

43:14.923 --> 43:16.321
Ready to go.

43:17.455 --> 43:19.320
I remember this one guy.

43:19.754 --> 43:22.052
In '85 or '86.

43:22.054 --> 43:24.918
A really quiet fellow.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.718
The night before,

43:27.720 --> 43:31.551
he told his religious counselor
that he didn't do it.

43:31.553 --> 43:35.150
In the morning, we had to
drag him out of his cell,

43:35.152 --> 43:37.283
He was kicking and yelling
all the way here.

43:37.285 --> 43:39.416
I quickly put the noose on him.

43:39.418 --> 43:42.182
He went down just like that.

43:42.184 --> 43:43.881
No prayers, no nothing.

43:45.282 --> 43:46.748
He didn't do it?

43:50.415 --> 43:53.931
He was just afraid and chickened
out the night before.

43:58.747 --> 43:59.846
Wanna try?

44:03.479 --> 44:04.877
There.

44:04.879 --> 44:06.877
Remove the pin first.

44:17.910 --> 44:20.028
Just pull the lever in one go.

44:49.073 --> 44:50.305
Hello.

44:51.372 --> 44:52.738
<i>What are you doing?</i>

44:53.138 --> 44:54.437
Tea break.

44:55.671 --> 44:57.369
<i>Will you be back late?</i>

44:57.371 --> 44:58.535
Maybe.

44:58.868 --> 45:00.167
Why?

45:00.834 --> 45:02.266
<i>Can we talk?</i>

45:02.966 --> 45:04.432
We can talk now.

45:06.633 --> 45:10.963
<i>There's something I've been
wanting to tell you face-to-face</i>

45:10.965 --> 45:13.196
But I didn't get the chance.

45:13.198 --> 45:15.795
<i>And I'm flying off soon.</i>

45:17.096 --> 45:18.795
<i>John proposed to me.</i>

45:20.663 --> 45:21.794
<i>And I said yes.</i>

45:27.695 --> 45:28.793
Congrats.

45:32.694 --> 45:34.559
<i>He wants me</i>

45:34.561 --> 45:36.791
To move to Australia with him.

45:42.924 --> 45:43.923
<i>Aiman?</i>

45:53.323 --> 45:55.555
I also have some news.

45:59.322 --> 46:03.387
Do you remember the hangman
I was talking about?

46:06.987 --> 46:09.185
He asked me to be his assistant.

46:13.119 --> 46:14.551
<i>You said no, right?</i>

46:17.084 --> 46:18.249
<i>Aiman?</i>

46:18.949 --> 46:20.148
<i>Aiman!</i>

46:34.911 --> 46:36.776
Aiman! Open the door!

46:39.644 --> 46:42.441
Aiman! Open the door!

46:48.906 --> 46:49.938
Aiman!

46:54.305 --> 46:56.770
What do you think you're doing?

46:56.772 --> 46:58.970
Have you lost your mind?

47:01.537 --> 47:04.701
Why did you say those things?
Are you trying to upset me?

47:12.535 --> 47:15.267
Okay. Congratulations.

47:15.269 --> 47:17.066
Isn't it what you wanted?

47:17.068 --> 47:20.499
- Using that man to get out of here!
- Don't talk to me like that!

47:25.032 --> 47:27.430
So what if I want
to get out of here?

47:29.030 --> 47:32.029
I'm tired.
Of our family bullshit.

47:32.031 --> 47:34.469
Of caring for you,
caring for grandma.

47:34.729 --> 47:37.047
Caring for grandpa
when they both got sick.

47:38.927 --> 47:42.659
Is it wrong? For once, I
want to lead my own life.

47:50.460 --> 47:53.358
So did you agree?
To work for that man?

47:58.058 --> 48:00.136
What are you trying to prove?

48:07.523 --> 48:09.421
I don't want to be like him.

48:13.654 --> 48:14.933
Who?

48:19.320 --> 48:20.718
You are not father!

48:24.352 --> 48:26.817
But so what if you are like him?

48:26.819 --> 48:29.484
- He made mistakes.
- Everybody does.

48:33.117 --> 48:35.415
I know you never met him.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.780
He wasn't some monster.

48:44.047 --> 48:45.612
He was my father.

48:47.713 --> 48:51.479
He truly cared for me.
And for you too.

48:59.711 --> 49:01.510
You know, I told John.

49:02.377 --> 49:03.875
I told him everything.

49:05.243 --> 49:07.208
And you were right.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.574
I had to come clean.

49:09.576 --> 49:12.274
- And you know what?
- He didn't mind.

49:12.276 --> 49:14.307
Of course he didn't mind.

49:15.807 --> 49:18.705
- Because he's not family!
-Don't you understand? I'm marrying him.

49:18.707 --> 49:21.205
- He is family!
- Okay, fine!

49:21.207 --> 49:25.505
Then you can get out of here, be
his family. Don't bother about me!

49:25.507 --> 49:29.970
You always do this. Saying things to
hurt me! You trying to drive me away?

49:29.972 --> 49:31.403
You doing this on purpose?

49:32.970 --> 49:34.968
You've gone too far, Aiman.

49:35.635 --> 49:37.368
I've had enough.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.959
Hi. What's your name?

51:56.961 --> 51:58.658
Mom!

52:05.292 --> 52:06.657
Hi, good afternoon.

52:07.724 --> 52:09.456
I'm looking for Mrs. Tan.

52:10.723 --> 52:11.755
Yes?

52:13.223 --> 52:15.921
Hi, I'm from Larangan prison.

52:15.923 --> 52:19.121
You were supposed to drop off some
clothes for Mr. Randy tan this morning?

52:19.123 --> 52:20.753
He's from the prison.

52:20.755 --> 52:23.853
She's not in. She's not in.

52:55.082 --> 52:56.214
Carry on.

52:59.414 --> 53:01.579
Had your lunch?
Yes, sir.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.311
Was it good?

53:04.945 --> 53:08.509
I asked the cookhouse to
make it specially for you.

53:08.511 --> 53:09.575
Thank you, sir.

53:11.342 --> 53:13.374
Father Daniel came today?

53:15.209 --> 53:16.807
You spoke with him?

53:22.307 --> 53:24.539
Your wife, she came by.

53:25.673 --> 53:26.705
When?

53:33.206 --> 53:34.737
She brought you this...

53:37.804 --> 53:40.083
For you to wear on Friday.

53:46.770 --> 53:47.802
Where is she now?

53:51.469 --> 53:54.734
Your father-in-law didn't
want her to see you.

53:56.434 --> 54:00.699
She's glad that you signed
your organ donor sheet.

54:03.100 --> 54:06.264
You are leaving this world
and helping others.

54:08.199 --> 54:10.297
She's forgiven you, Randy.

54:30.964 --> 54:34.696
What if that guy...
Really didn't do it?

54:37.130 --> 54:38.428
Which guy?

54:39.662 --> 54:43.195
The one who had to be dragged
out of his cell.

54:43.197 --> 54:44.694
He pleaded guilty.

54:46.327 --> 54:49.659
The judge found him guilty.
That's that.

54:53.392 --> 54:54.824
What's up with you?

54:55.825 --> 54:56.890
Nothing.

55:03.356 --> 55:04.821
You okay for tomorrow?

55:06.855 --> 55:08.520
I'm okay, chief.

55:20.054 --> 55:21.251
Cigarette?

55:23.719 --> 55:25.617
Put the oil back.

55:28.651 --> 55:31.383
Come, I'll give you a ride home.

55:37.650 --> 55:39.248
Where should I turn?

55:40.749 --> 55:42.380
At this traffic light.

55:46.513 --> 55:51.545
The next guy after Randy,
has been with us for five years.

55:51.547 --> 55:53.645
His twin boys come every day.

55:54.379 --> 55:57.244
Poor things, those two.

55:57.246 --> 56:00.777
What crime did he commit?
Drug trafficking.

56:01.944 --> 56:03.409
Heroin.

56:05.376 --> 56:07.375
Do you feel sorry for him?

56:08.642 --> 56:10.407
What's the point?

56:12.207 --> 56:14.372
He only trafficked drugs.

56:15.840 --> 56:17.505
Not like it's murder.

56:21.205 --> 56:24.370
So now you don't think
we should hang them?

56:36.738 --> 56:37.897
Move!

57:01.532 --> 57:04.630
Thanks, chief... 
For the ride.

57:05.764 --> 57:07.003
Good night.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.779
Come on, let's go.

01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:39.210
Hey, we must go already.

01:00:41.511 --> 01:00:43.309
Hey, wake up!

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:03.901
Randy, up!

01:03:03.903 --> 01:03:05.635
Up! Let's go.

01:03:11.234 --> 01:03:13.199
Take a deep breath, Randy.

01:03:14.066 --> 01:03:15.398
Deep breaths.

01:03:15.731 --> 01:03:16.930
Slowly.

01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:25.195
Slowly.

01:03:35.727 --> 01:03:36.892
Don't worry.

01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:40.124
Just follow me.

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:52.356
May Christ,
the Son of the living God,

01:03:52.358 --> 01:03:58.555
Set you on the Evergreen
Loveliness of His Paradise.

01:03:58.557 --> 01:04:02.388
And may He, the True Shepherd,
recognize you...

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:04.320
Come on, Randy, come on.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.052
Pinion.

01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:16.484
I'm sending you
to a better place, Randy.

01:05:56.011 --> 01:05:57.542
Take off the hood.

01:06:28.142 --> 01:06:30.640
Time of death: 06:06.

01:06:32.074 --> 01:06:34.006
Condition leading to death:

01:06:34.008 --> 01:06:36.571
Fractured dislocation
of cervical spine.

01:06:38.139 --> 01:06:39.604
Onset of death:

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.104
Instantaneous.

01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:04.033
One, two, three, four.

01:07:04.035 --> 01:07:07.099
Two, two, three, four.

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:34.955
Hi, this is Suhaila. I can't
come to the phone right now.

01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:38.255
Please leave me a message, and I'll
call you back as soon as I can.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.087
Hi, this is Suhaila.

01:08:59.089 --> 01:09:03.086
I can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave me a message...

01:09:13.185 --> 01:09:14.383
Sis?

01:09:23.814 --> 01:09:24.814
Sis?

01:10:07.511 --> 01:10:10.077
- Chief clerk's not in?
- No.

01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.442
Pass this to him.
Yes, chief.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:18.775
Ah. My guy's security
clearance done yet?

01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:21.674
Not yet. Security department
just got his birth certificate.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:16.769
Chief.

01:11:19.103 --> 01:11:20.501
Where did you go?

01:11:23.969 --> 01:11:27.900
There was an emergency at home.
Had to go back for a while.

01:11:29.233 --> 01:11:30.865
What kind of emergency?

01:11:30.867 --> 01:11:35.864
Did you bring the gallows key out?
Tell me the truth.

01:11:37.497 --> 01:11:40.229
What do you mean?
I just went home for a while.

01:11:47.529 --> 01:11:49.427
Anything you want to tell me?

01:11:53.827 --> 01:11:57.358
I think that...
I can't continue here, chief.

01:11:59.325 --> 01:12:02.957
Maybe it's best
that I transfer back

01:12:02.959 --> 01:12:04.489
To the workshop.

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:08.621
I'm more used
to things over there.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.752
Give me back the key.

01:12:24.919 --> 01:12:26.484
You can leave now.

01:12:50.051 --> 01:12:51.649
Who sent you?

01:12:52.616 --> 01:12:54.214
Who do you work for?

01:12:56.181 --> 01:12:57.680
No one.

01:12:57.682 --> 01:12:59.346
Don't fuck with me.

01:13:00.113 --> 01:13:02.145
You think I'm some spy?

01:13:02.147 --> 01:13:05.224
We'll let security
department look into it.

01:13:05.312 --> 01:13:07.644
What did I do wrong?

01:13:07.646 --> 01:13:10.677
You didn't declare who your father was.
That's a chargeable offense.

01:13:10.679 --> 01:13:12.677
Don't pretend
you didn't know that.

01:13:13.344 --> 01:13:14.876
Why does it matter?

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:17.608
Your father was a murderer.

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:22.474
Thought you could just waltz in here?
You shouldn't even be here.

01:13:22.476 --> 01:13:25.507
So what if my father was a murderer?
I'm not him!

01:13:25.509 --> 01:13:28.740
He committed the crime,
and I have to pay for it?

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.371
My whole life I've had to
struggle with what he did.

01:13:37.373 --> 01:13:40.004
I joined gangs.
I did drugs.

01:13:40.006 --> 01:13:42.203
I almost died, you know?

01:13:42.205 --> 01:13:45.203
It's a miracle that I can
have a job I'm good at.

01:13:45.205 --> 01:13:48.502
You said so yourself.
But now it's not good enough?

01:13:49.836 --> 01:13:52.334
It's easy for you to talk
about redemption to Randy.

01:13:52.336 --> 01:13:54.534
That his family's better off...

01:13:54.536 --> 01:13:56.767
What I tell him is none
of your business.

01:13:56.769 --> 01:13:58.466
Bullshit!

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:03.198
You lied to Randy so it's
easier for you to hang him!

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.798
What compassion?
What principles?

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:10.097
All you care about is yourself, how
good you are at killing people!

01:14:12.033 --> 01:14:13.964
Who do you think you are?

01:14:13.966 --> 01:14:16.263
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:14:16.265 --> 01:14:21.195
You come in here and think you can tell
me what's right and wrong? Who are you?

01:14:21.197 --> 01:14:23.759
I'm good at killing people.
So what?

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:30.159
How fucked up your life is has
nothing to do with me or what I do.

01:14:30.161 --> 01:14:33.892
It's fucked up because
of what your father did.

01:14:33.894 --> 01:14:35.558
Don't blame me.

01:14:37.225 --> 01:14:40.591
He cut up his friend
to cover his tracks.

01:14:40.593 --> 01:14:43.457
What sick person would do that?

01:14:44.558 --> 01:14:46.796
Serves him right,
you understand?

01:14:49.457 --> 01:14:54.288
Still, I did my job nice and
clean despite what he did.

01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:56.721
Do you know what
the papers said about him?

01:15:00.821 --> 01:15:04.553
People were saying hanging
was too easy for him.

01:15:08.153 --> 01:15:11.252
But I still did my job.
I made it painless.

01:15:11.254 --> 01:15:13.252
That is compassion, understand?

01:15:13.254 --> 01:15:15.452
Who are you to lecture me?

01:15:17.052 --> 01:15:20.650
Your father was hanged and you
want to become a hangman.

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:24.182
How fucked up are you?

01:15:32.349 --> 01:15:34.648
I've written up
your charge sheet.

01:15:36.081 --> 01:15:39.447
In the morning, I'll send it in
for your disciplinary review.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.279
You can get lost now.

01:17:32.937 --> 01:17:36.035
<i>Hi, this is Suhaila. I can't
come to the phone right now.</i>

01:17:36.037 --> 01:17:39.701
<i>Please leave me a message, and I'll
call you back as soon as I can.</i>

01:17:41.736 --> 01:17:42.800
Sis.

01:17:44.233 --> 01:17:45.799
How's Australia?

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:50.531
You okay?

01:17:54.764 --> 01:17:56.629
I don't know what to do now.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:00.261
I'm confused.

01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:06.293
They found out about father.

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:09.792
I think...

01:18:10.492 --> 01:18:12.390
I'm going to get charged.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:16.456
Because I didn't declare.

01:18:23.256 --> 01:18:24.455
You were right.

01:18:28.222 --> 01:18:30.287
Why didn't I listen to you?

01:18:35.654 --> 01:18:36.918
When you get this...

01:18:38.785 --> 01:18:40.284
Call me back...

01:18:41.018 --> 01:18:42.250
Okay?

01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:02.047
Yeah, Aiman.

01:19:02.049 --> 01:19:04.313
Why, what happened?

01:19:04.315 --> 01:19:06.512
Something's wrong.
I'll tell you later.

01:19:07.713 --> 01:19:09.078
And Joseph?

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.244
Hey, uncle, what's for lunch?

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.642
Aiman!

01:19:22.209 --> 01:19:23.541
Sir.

01:19:51.473 --> 01:19:53.904
We got a call
from the hospital this morning.

01:19:56.205 --> 01:19:57.903
Chief Rahim had an accident.

01:20:03.003 --> 01:20:04.801
But I was just
with him last night.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:09.534
I don't know what happened.
Police are investigating.

01:20:11.668 --> 01:20:12.899
How is he, sir?

01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:15.998
He's in the ICU.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.665
Still hasn't woken up.

01:20:21.697 --> 01:20:22.862
Actually...

01:20:23.896 --> 01:20:26.528
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.894
Permanent Secretary rang
this morning,

01:20:28.896 --> 01:20:31.692
asking who is going
to take over as executioner.

01:20:33.893 --> 01:20:35.425
I recommended you.

01:20:40.425 --> 01:20:43.223
There's a high-profile
drugs case coming up.

01:20:43.225 --> 01:20:44.504
We can't afford to wait.

01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:49.988
I was there yesterday.

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:51.488
You did very well.

01:20:56.987 --> 01:20:59.885
Your chief would be very happy
to know that you took over.

01:22:34.978 --> 01:22:36.377
Have you visited chief?

01:22:37.511 --> 01:22:38.609
Yep.

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:48.928
I'm glad you're taking over.

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:53.413
You're a lot braver than me.

01:22:55.873 --> 01:22:57.711
I just couldn't pull the lever.

01:23:18.871 --> 01:23:20.203
Seventy-three.

01:23:23.137 --> 01:23:25.869
Come.

01:23:34.935 --> 01:23:37.100
Mr. Leong?
Yeah.

01:23:37.102 --> 01:23:38.732
Here's my father's clothes.

01:23:55.132 --> 01:23:56.497
From your sons.

01:25:56.326 --> 01:25:57.724
What's that?

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:42.687
Sis?

01:26:42.689 --> 01:26:44.787
<i>Aiman, are you okay?</i>

01:26:44.789 --> 01:26:48.186
<i>I just got your message.
Did they charge you?</i>

01:26:48.886 --> 01:26:49.885
Aiman!

01:26:51.752 --> 01:26:52.951
No.

01:26:52.953 --> 01:26:54.850
They haven't charged me yet.

01:26:57.218 --> 01:27:00.182
<i>Is there a chance they won't?</i>

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:02.647
<i>What will you do now?</i>

01:27:03.748 --> 01:27:05.546
Hey, let's go.

01:27:08.346 --> 01:27:10.811
Sorry, I have to go now.

01:27:12.578 --> 01:27:13.737
<i>Okay, Aiman.</i>

01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:18.209
<i>I know that you will make
the right decision.</i>

01:27:20.176 --> 01:27:22.208
<i>You always do.</i>

01:27:25.075 --> 01:27:26.473
<i>You're my little brother.</i>

01:27:27.574 --> 01:27:31.106
<i>Whatever happens,
I'll be here for you.</i>

01:27:33.773 --> 01:27:35.052
Thanks, sis.

01:28:03.436 --> 01:28:05.334
Morning, sir.
Aiman.

01:28:06.601 --> 01:28:08.133
This is Mr. Singh.

01:28:08.135 --> 01:28:09.899
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:28:09.901 --> 01:28:11.198
This is Mr. Siew.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.879
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

01:28:19.698 --> 01:28:20.863
You ready?

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:37.196
Get up!

01:30:17.022 --> 01:30:18.620
Come, follow me.

01:30:29.752 --> 01:30:31.784
Come. Few more steps.

01:30:32.317 --> 01:30:33.716
Few more steps.
