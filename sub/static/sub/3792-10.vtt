01:13.782 --> 01:15.825
I'm asking if you think
I should work with this girl.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.536
I'm asking if you think you could work
with her without trying to bang her.

01:18.620 --> 01:20.580
- She has a boyfriend.
- I don't think E could work with her

01:20.664 --> 01:22.790
- without trying to bang her.
- I never seem to be able to.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.625
Yeah, but the girls you work with

01:24.710 --> 01:26.586
want to bang you, Vin.
She doesn't wanna bang him.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.297
- Or do you still think she does, E?
- She has a boyfriend, Turtle!

01:29.381 --> 01:31.132
So? It's not a husband.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.592
And if you think
she'd want to bang you

01:32.676 --> 01:34.594
if she didn't have a boyfriend,
you'd lie in wait.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.803
Eventually that would end.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.388
- You'd be in like Flynn.
- Totally.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.098
Is that why
you guys never get laid?

01:39.183 --> 01:40.266
Always waiting
for relationships to end?

01:41.477 --> 01:43.603
Look, E, last night you thought
you were on a date with the girl.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.855
I'm just not sure you can
let that go and be professional.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.940
- Yeah well, I am sure.
- So why are you asking?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.442
I'm just making sure
you're okay with it.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.693
Are you okay with it?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.779
Look, not all clients
are as easy as me.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.447
And actresses... forget it.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.824
- Oh yeah.
- Look, the girl's a talent, all right?

01:56.909 --> 01:59.035
It's a great way
to expand our business.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.120
- Our business?
- Yeah. I've been thinking.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.997
You and I, 50/50 on every client I hit.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.499
- Where do I fit in?
- You don't.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.542
You know, that's sweet,
but not necessary.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.836
Come on, Vince.
Look, I know where I'd be without you.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.295
Nowhere.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.839
Don't you have a job to go to, Drama?

02:11.924 --> 02:13.966
That's the beauty
of an ensemble cast...

02:14.051 --> 02:15.468
two-day work weeks.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.303
- Vince.
- E, it is not necessary.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.056
It's great that other people
are recognizing what you do for me,

02:20.140 --> 02:21.599
and I wish you nothing but success.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.184
I only ask that you make sure

02:23.268 --> 02:25.144
that my career attention
does not suffer.

02:25.229 --> 02:27.647
Yeah, E. Look out for numero uno.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.899
Yeah. Always always always.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.734
Ooh!

02:33.904 --> 02:35.613
I have Dana Gordon.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.115
Weird, I used to push up
on top of Dana Gordon like this.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.575
True story.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.913
Dana, I was just thinking about you.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.374
Did you read Billy Walsh's script?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.168
- Did I get Billy Walsh's script?
- I got it this morning.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.754
Lloyd! Do I have Billy Walsh's script?

02:51.839 --> 02:52.839
Miriam just brought it up.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.924
Call Walsh and find out why
I didn't get a chance

02:55.008 --> 02:56.676
to comment on it
before he turned it in.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.469
Just got it. How's it feeling?

02:58.554 --> 03:02.014
I'm on page 12 and I do not
understand what I'm reading.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.767
Well, you didn't understand "Titanic"
after 12 pages either, Dana.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.103
Ari, this is totally fucked, okay?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.438
- This is not what we bought and I do...
- What do you mean?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.274
Read the thing, Ari.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.485
Left word for Walsh.

03:14.570 --> 03:15.778
Keep trying him and call E,

03:15.863 --> 03:19.156
and make sure that Vince
is reading this as well.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.034
I can't hear you, Lloyd. I'm in the hills.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.995
Did you get the Billy Walsh script?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.205
Lloyd, I can't hear you.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.417
Did you get

03:29.501 --> 03:32.086
the Billy Walsh script?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.130
Shut the fuck up, Lloyd!

03:34.548 --> 03:37.174
Lloyd? Hello? Hello hello hello?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.135
- There's no cell reception up here.
- Yeah, I'm getting that.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.137
Do you guys have a hardline
around here, by chance?

03:41.221 --> 03:42.889
- I don't... I don't know.
- Thanks, man.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.807
- There's my guy!
- Hey!

03:44.892 --> 03:46.183
- Hey.
- How are you?

03:46.268 --> 03:49.270
Oh, so Vince is okay with this?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.230
- Oh yeah, he was cool. Totally cool.
- Smart move.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.524
I would've fought him for you,
and I'm freakishly strong.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.735
- I'm glad it didn't come to that.
- Yeah, me too.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.737
So I'm sorry for putting you
to work day one.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.155
It's just I've got to
summon up my inner supermodel

03:59.239 --> 04:00.239
and I've got these people

04:00.324 --> 04:03.451
coming at me with concepts
and interviews and wardrobe and...

04:03.535 --> 04:05.411
I'm so thankful you're here to help.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.747
Yeah well, I'm glad to do it,
even though fashion isn't my thing.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.332
But if you really want my opinion,

04:09.416 --> 04:11.417
I like the black outfit
you wore in the first "Scary Movie. "

04:11.501 --> 04:13.002
It made you look smart,
but still kind of hot.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.795
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.089
It was on...
cable like... like a year ago.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.760
And I might have bought the DVD.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.553
I was just trying to catch up,
you know?

04:22.638 --> 04:23.596
Right. Yeah.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.224
Right. Oh, we are gonna be
great together, E.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.353
- Really great. I'm so excited.
- Yeah, me too.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.730
- Yo, what up, girl?
- Hey, Dave!

04:32.814 --> 04:34.106
Hey, baby.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.733
- Mmm.
- Oh.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.568
This is the guy
I was telling you about... E.

04:37.653 --> 04:38.778
This is my boyfriend Dave.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.696
Hey, Dave, how are you?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.823
- You're the new manager, dawg?
- Yeah.

04:42.908 --> 04:45.785
I just, you know...
I just thought you'd be a little older.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.787
- I'm older than I look.
Mmm.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.455
A'ight... Yeah...

04:50.874 --> 04:52.583
- So?
- So...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.045
Uh, so, why don't you ask
the new manager

04:56.129 --> 04:57.588
what he thinks of my idea?

04:57.673 --> 04:59.173
Dave, I...

04:59.257 --> 05:01.509
What? Yo yo, check this, okay?

05:01.593 --> 05:05.388
I want them to shoot Anna
in a series of animal poses, okay?

05:05.472 --> 05:07.473
Like one where she sticks
her neck out like this, a'ight?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.849
It's like a giraffe, all right?

05:08.934 --> 05:11.227
Another one where we make
her hair really really big...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.062
she'll be, like, a lion, huh?

05:13.146 --> 05:15.189
- What do you think?
- It's interesting.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.233
What do you really think?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.318
Uh, I think it's a little weird.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.861
And no offense, Dave, but it is.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.863
- It's... a little weird.
- It is a little weird, babe.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.782
Okay.
Well, I thought it'd be hot, okay?

05:24.866 --> 05:27.868
You think everything I do is hot
and that's why I love you.

05:27.953 --> 05:31.414
But this is a little weird,
so let's let it go, please.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.249
- Okay, baby.
- Okay.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.251
I'm gonna go get ready.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.545
Um... yo, dawg,

05:37.629 --> 05:40.464
I'm gonna go watch
my girl get ready, okay?

05:40.632 --> 05:44.051
So why don't you grab me a coke and
bring it over to the trailer, a'ight?

05:44.136 --> 05:47.513
Yeah, they're, um...
they're right there. Thanks, dawg.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.765
Bring that right over.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.356
- Yeah?
- Hello?

05:57.441 --> 05:58.733
- Turtle?
- Drama?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.526
- Hey, Ari! What's up?
- What's up, Lloyd?

06:00.610 --> 06:02.528
- I'm looking for Vince.
- Do you know where Vince is?

06:02.612 --> 06:03.863
Aren't you supposed
to go through E for Vince?

06:03.947 --> 06:04.947
Did you try E?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.824
If he's there,
put him on the fucking phone, Turtle.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.117
I called E and e-mailed him too.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.201
Let me see if he's here. Hang on.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.619
I'll see if I can locate him.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.872
- Yo, Vince, you're here for Ari?
- Why wouldn't I be?

06:12.956 --> 06:14.290
Lloyd says he can't find E.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.375
Oh, it's fine. Hey, Lloyd.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.210
- Hey, Vince. Hold for Ari.
- Okay.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.296
- I got Ari, Vince.
- Oh.

06:20.797 --> 06:21.881
- Ari.
- Vince!

06:21.965 --> 06:23.049
I've got Vince.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.925
I got fucking Vince.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.385
- Vince!
- Ari?

06:26.470 --> 06:28.304
Did you read Walsh's script?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.889
Did I get Walsh's script?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.016
It was dropped off to me
and the studio this morning.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.434
Any scripts come for us this morning?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.019
Uh, yeah, I put 'em in the pile.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.729
Yeah, I've got it. What's the problem?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.648
The problem is
he took your snow-on-a-mountain movie

06:39.733 --> 06:41.567
and turned it into a futuristic thriller

06:41.651 --> 06:45.071
set on a farm, circa 2075.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.990
- I don't understand.
- He tossed the book away,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.242
the book they paid him
$3 million to write,

06:50.327 --> 06:52.078
and decided just
to make up his own story.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.705
Huh, that's odd. Call Walsh.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.291
- Dana Gordon on one.
- Did E know anything about this?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.418
- No, of course not.
- Then why is he in hiding?

06:59.503 --> 07:01.796
He's not in hiding. He's at
a photo shoot with his new client.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.423
- E's got a new client?
- Yeah, Anna Faris.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.593
- Come on!
- Yep.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.096
Jesus! The world is falling apart.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.223
It's always darkest before dawn, Ari.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.516
I got Billy's voicemail.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.893
Billy Walsh just said
in response to your question

07:15.977 --> 07:17.728
of why did he give
the script to the studio

07:17.813 --> 07:19.688
before you had a chance
to comment on it...

07:19.773 --> 07:22.650
and I'm quoting him here... "'Cause
I don't give a fuck what you think. "

07:22.734 --> 07:24.235
Get his address.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.404
Vinnie, sit tight.
I will get right back to you.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.865
Okay. Bye, Ari.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.367
Boy, he's stressed.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.120
- Do you want me to call E?
- No. I'm the producer.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.331
I can handle it. Let's just see
what crazy Billy did, huh?

07:37.415 --> 07:39.083
Hey, how about I read E's copy?

07:39.167 --> 07:41.710
Yeah. I like the initiative, Turtle.

07:42.212 --> 07:45.548
- What should I do?
- Why don't you make us a snack?

07:46.716 --> 07:49.218
I like being E. Huh.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.099
Oh, that's so hot. Perfect.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.226
Turn into it. Turn into it.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.272
Shit.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.108
Hey, you can get a signal
right at the bottom of the hill.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.485
Or if you want, we have a runner
we can send to make a call for you.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.445
No, thanks anyway.
I'll go down there and make the call.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.949
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
- No problem.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.325
- She looks good, huh?
- No no.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.619
I'm not feeling this shit at all, okay?

08:15.704 --> 08:18.831
Baby, baby, okay?
Do one like a cat, okay?

08:18.915 --> 08:20.791
A fierce cat...

08:20.876 --> 08:22.168
Just jump out.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.545
Baby, trust me on this, okay?
Please please?

08:24.629 --> 08:27.464
Big eyes like an owl
and this shit is gonna pop!

08:27.549 --> 08:29.592
Come on, Dave. I...

08:29.676 --> 08:31.427
Okay, am I wrong, dawg?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.345
Huh?
A little reckless abandonment here.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.471
It would stamp this thing unique.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.640
I think she looks beautiful.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.934
Fucking hack.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.979
Anna, are you cool if I run down
to the bottom of the hill

08:42.063 --> 08:43.688
- to make a call?
- Yeah.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.566
Okay. I'll be right back.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.943
All right, everyone. Let's take five.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.864
- All right, so... It's Eric, right?
- Yeah.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.657
- Look, you can't leave now.
- Why not?

08:53.742 --> 08:56.577
I'm not getting what I need
out of Anna. She's not focused.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.537
All right, I'll talk to her.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.165
No no no, she's not the problem.
The boyfriend is.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.083
As long as he's hanging around
criticizing her,

09:03.168 --> 09:04.293
she's just not gonna bring it.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.794
You don't want to say
something to him?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.339
I take pictures.
I don't interfere with domesticity.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.966
All right, I'll say something to him.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.552
Don't touch the camera.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.054
- Hey, Dave.
- Yo, dawg, what's up?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.889
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.226
Listen, I think you're making Anna
a little uncomfortable.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.728
Wow, you've been working with her,

09:22.812 --> 09:25.189
what, one day?
How do you know what I'm making her?

09:25.273 --> 09:27.274
Maybe you're making
the photographer uncomfortable.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.859
Either way,
if you're gonna hang around,

09:28.944 --> 09:29.902
try to be a little less critical.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.404
No no, this is not good, okay?
I'm not feeling this.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.114
Okay? Anna, baby?

09:34.199 --> 09:36.075
Anna? Okay, baby?

09:36.368 --> 09:38.577
Look, I need to talk to you
for a second, okay?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.412
- In the trailer.
- Okay.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.830
Excuse me.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.101
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.185
Is Billy Walsh here?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.479
Oh, hey, no. Billy's not here.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.024
I see him sitting on the couch there.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.610
She means I'm not here for you, Ari.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.070
Can I please come in?

10:13.196 --> 10:14.571
Not if you're gonna criticize me.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.448
Why would I criticize you?

10:16.533 --> 10:17.866
Let him in.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.747
So everyone hates the script.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.959
You got paid a half
a million dollars to adapt a book

10:27.043 --> 10:28.335
and you didn't do it.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.920
I decided to go
in a different direction.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.089
They didn't pay you
for that direction.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.217
Hey, the script that he wrote
is really hot, man.

10:36.886 --> 10:37.970
Ahem!

10:38.054 --> 10:40.347
You don't want to give the studio
back their money, do you, Billy?

10:40.432 --> 10:42.057
- The money's been spent, Ari.
- On what?

10:42.142 --> 10:45.102
- Home improvements.
- We put in a steam shower.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.771
How long will it take you to do
what they paid you to do?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.690
Infinity, 'cause I'm not gonna do it!

10:49.774 --> 10:52.901
- You have to do it!
- I've tried to do it, Ari!

10:53.069 --> 10:55.404
I did, but every time
I started to write a scene

10:55.488 --> 10:58.240
I got these two guys
locked alone on a mountain

10:58.325 --> 11:00.242
and it felt really gay.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.286
And it was my idea to add the chicks.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.289
- See, Billy writes chicks really good.
- Thanks, babe.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.291
Vince stuck his neck out for you

11:07.375 --> 11:09.626
and now you are
fucking him and the studio.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.837
They are going to
fuck you right back.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.340
- They can't touch me.
- They can sue you

11:14.424 --> 11:17.718
and make sure that you never
make a movie in this town again.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.386
Well, good thing I paint.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.681
You're not gonna do this, are you?

11:22.766 --> 11:24.099
No, I'm not.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.770
Then I've got nothing else
to say to you.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.773
Yeah well, I've got
something to say to you:

11:31.900 --> 11:34.818
You are no longer my agent!

11:34.903 --> 11:37.321
Yeah, Lloyd?

11:37.405 --> 11:39.948
- It's your wife. She says it's urgent.
- Put her through, Lloyd.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.992
- Here she is.
- What's wrong, baby?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.994
You're avoiding my fucking calls.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.997
Does that sound like my wife, Lloyd?

11:47.165 --> 11:49.666
It did, yes. But now it doesn't. Sorry.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.586
- What's up, Dana?
- I haven't walked out of my office...

11:52.670 --> 11:55.005
not even to pee... in three hours.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.382
What are you, agoraphobic?

11:56.466 --> 11:58.258
No, I'm scared to see my boss

11:58.343 --> 12:00.677
because I have no idea
what to tell him.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.471
Well, that is the beauty of me, Dana.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.348
I tell people what
to tell other people.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.892
- So tell me something!
- Fire Walsh.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.852
- Fire him?
- Yes. I just did.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.772
So he has no intention of writing
what he was supposed to write?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.024
None, but I have intentions of finding you

12:14.109 --> 12:17.403
an A-list writer/director
to replace him by sundown.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.822
And I will bring him in at cost.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.366
- Lloyd, get a list together.
- I can't believe this.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.284
Wake up, Dana. It's real.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.745
The first big project
you brought into your new studio

12:26.830 --> 12:28.372
is in shambles.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.582
Thanks to your
writer/director, asshole!

12:30.667 --> 12:33.252
You know, if you think
my last boss was vindictive,

12:33.336 --> 12:34.711
you haven't seen shit!

12:34.796 --> 12:36.839
You'd better find me someone approvable

12:36.923 --> 12:38.590
and you'd better make sure
Vince is onboard.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.260
Because if I have to go in
and tell Richard Wimmer

12:41.344 --> 12:45.139
that we lost a script,
a director and a star today...

12:45.223 --> 12:47.349
all of whom are
yourfucking clients...

12:47.434 --> 12:50.602
you can bet your ass
that nobody who has ever been

12:50.687 --> 12:52.271
close enough to smell your breath

12:52.355 --> 12:55.149
will ever be welcome
at this studio again!

13:00.864 --> 13:03.365
Vince, it's Ari.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.951
Eh, I'll call him when I'm finished.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.412
Hey, some help this guy is.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.955
I'm not sleeping, jerkoff.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.415
I'm pacing myself.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.875
Yeah? Were you enjoying it, Turtle?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.460
Yeah well, don't get mad, Vin,

13:14.544 --> 13:16.295
but I was kind of
just scanning it for the sex scenes.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.046
There are two good ones, by the way.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.923
There's a lot of parts in here, Vince.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.593
Billy liked what I did
in "Medellin," right?

13:22.677 --> 13:26.305
No. I really do need E.
Call him, Turtle.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.223
- I could finish, man.
- Call him.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.184
Call him, Turtle.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.231
Straight to voicemail.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.984
Nice. Very nice.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.825
Excuse me, miss. Can you get that
runner to make a call for me?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.202
Sure, who's the call to?

13:48.286 --> 13:50.746
Okay, the call is to Ari Gold
at the Miller Gold Agency.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.498
And you're going to ask for Lloyd

13:52.582 --> 13:54.500
and see if there's anything
important going on.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.834
All right, you got it.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.378
- Great. Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.505
- Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

13:59.589 --> 14:00.756
- You Anna's manager?
- Yeah.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.508
Can you manage her?
We're ready to shoot.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.634
She's not coming out of her trailer.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.968
She's talking to her boyfriend.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.345
Look, once the sun is over that tree,

14:06.429 --> 14:08.305
we're done. We can't shoot.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.765
Okay. Okay, I'll take care of it.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.183
All right.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.270
No, I'm helping you!

14:15.355 --> 14:16.688
Why are you fighting me on this?

14:16.773 --> 14:18.524
I'm trying to help you.
The cat's gonna help.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.275
Then maybe
it would be appropriate.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.653
It's the inner animal!
It's your inner animal!

14:25.615 --> 14:26.907
What do you want, dawg?

14:27.075 --> 14:28.951
Sorry to bother you, Dave...
I don't mean to interrupt...

14:29.035 --> 14:30.994
but they're ready for Anna onset.

14:31.079 --> 14:33.038
- We're in the middle of something.
- I really have to go.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.122
We need to talk about this later.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.290
What's more important to you,

14:35.375 --> 14:36.667
this relationship
or this photo shoot?

14:36.751 --> 14:38.710
Don't do that! I have to work!

14:38.795 --> 14:40.712
Oh, and I'm sorry I don't!

14:40.797 --> 14:42.673
Oh my God.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.091
Fuck this.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.968
- Dave!
- I'm out.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.262
I'm really sorry.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.055
He never used to be like this,

14:50.139 --> 14:51.848
but since the C.W. Passed on his pilot,

14:51.975 --> 14:54.726
he's been hanging around
my work being all hypercritical.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.605
God, you must think I'm a mess.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.399
No no no.
Look, relationships are tough.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.192
I'm sure you guys will get through it.

15:02.277 --> 15:04.194
- Does the crew totally hate me?
- No, not at all.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.946
Everything's... everything's fine.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.906
- You're good? You need a minute?
- No no no, I'm good.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.866
- Okay, here. Come on.
- Okay, thank you.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.119
- How's that dress feel?
- It's really uncomfortable.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.413
Not great, right?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.999
Hey, you needed me to go
make a phone call for you.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.750
I'm just confirming,
who was I supposed to call?

15:18.835 --> 15:20.711
You want to talk to Lloyd
in Ari Gold's office.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.838
Eric, if you need to go make
some phone calls, that's fine.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.256
- You sure?
- Totally.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.091
- I'll be back in five minutes.
- Okay.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.593
- All right?
- Hey, and E?

15:27.677 --> 15:28.677
Yeah?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.887
I swear I'm not as high
maintenance as it seems.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.223
Don't worry about it. As far as
my easiest clients are concerned,

15:33.308 --> 15:34.725
you're in the top two. Not bad.

15:34.809 --> 15:37.144
- All right, bye.
- I'll be back in two seconds.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.353
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.605
- So sorry, guys.
- Okay.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.274
Ari, making house calls.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.234
- I love it!
- Heh-heh, today is not the day

15:44.319 --> 15:45.652
to not pick up your phone, Vin.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.863
I was reading. Come on,
you should be proud.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.489
Normally you can't get me to do that.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.742
Well, today I actually
don't need you to do that.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.161
I made some lamb kebabs, Ari.
You want some?

15:54.245 --> 15:55.579
- No, thank you.
- They're good.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.873
No, thank you.
You know Richard Kelly?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.334
- Director?
- Yeah, the guy who did "Donnie Darko. "

16:00.418 --> 16:02.252
I know him. I like him... why?

16:02.337 --> 16:04.379
I represent him.
I can get him on "Clouds. "

16:04.464 --> 16:07.341
Plus, I can get the studio onboard
so we can keep this train rolling.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.051
What about Billy?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.136
Billy is a dead man. He's a corpse.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.556
You can't pull that kind of shit
when you get paid that kind of money.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.641
Did you read his script?

16:15.725 --> 16:17.517
I understand that you're
loyal to the guy.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.020
- But did you read it?
- I read the first 10 pages.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.439
There's no mountain.
Without a mountain, there's no movie.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.691
No, there is a movie, a great movie...

16:24.776 --> 16:26.860
better than "Clouds," I think.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.320
Are you fucking with me?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.447
Why would I do that, Ari?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.948
Is he fucking with me?

16:32.033 --> 16:34.701
"Clouds" was lacking in tits, Ari.
This one's got at least four.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.870
Yeah, there's a couple things
in there for me too, Ari.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.955
So you and Lloyd should
get on it ASAP.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.166
Ahem... where the hell is E?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.585
M.I.A.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.713
Well, we need him.
'Cause maybe that neurotic little elf

16:46.798 --> 16:49.466
nipping at your heels
will make you understand

16:49.550 --> 16:52.177
that we are in a major
crisis situation here.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.138
I think if you read the script,
Ari, you'd find that we're not.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.517
Come on, Ari. The tide
is turning for us, you know that.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.353
And the hype of "Medellin"
is growing as Cannes approaches.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.690
I like this script.
I want to make this movie with Billy.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.693
We can't do that. There is no way.

17:07.777 --> 17:10.695
There is always a way, Ari.
Come on, Bubala.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.571
Make it happen, huh?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.500
You following me, dawg?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.042
No, I was trying to make a phone call.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.545
Then why are you riding up my ass?

17:26.628 --> 17:28.463
I'm not riding up your ass.
I didn't even know it was you.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.965
Oh, you didn't. Okay.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.758
You got a thing for my girl?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.844
No, Dave, we work together.
What are you talking about?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.429
- Okay, you got a girlfriend?
- No.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.513
- You gay?
- No!

17:36.597 --> 17:38.181
Then how are you gonna
look at me in my face right now

17:38.266 --> 17:40.183
and tell me you ain't
got a thing for my girl?

17:40.268 --> 17:41.977
- Dave, you've got to chill.
- Whoa whoa!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.062
Don't tell me to chill, okay?

17:44.147 --> 17:46.398
My girlfriend, she comes
and tells me she's got a new manager

17:46.482 --> 17:48.525
and I'm thinking
it's gonna be some graybeard,

17:48.609 --> 17:49.651
Bernie Brillstein-type guy.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.821
Not some young non-gay guy
who ain't got no girl.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.449
Look, I promise you this relationship
is gonna be nothing but professional.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.743
Professional? How are you
gonna help her professionally?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.995
Why don't you sell me
however you sold her?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.748
I didn't sell her, okay? I told her
I didn't like a movie she was gonna do

18:02.832 --> 18:04.708
and she agreed with my opinion.
That's it.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.876
Okay.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.919
So you're the reason she didn't do it?

18:08.004 --> 18:08.962
Yeah.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.589
That's funny. That's really funny

18:10.673 --> 18:12.758
because I was the reason
she was gonna do it in the first place.

18:12.842 --> 18:15.719
What can I say about that? I'm just
trying to do my job. That's what I do.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.679
Your job's fucking with my life, okay?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.557
- And you never got me that coke!
- Dave!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.936
This is not happening.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.611
Dave!

18:36.532 --> 18:38.617
Are you out of your fucking mind?

18:38.701 --> 18:41.119
Did you even read
Walsh's script, Dana?

18:41.204 --> 18:44.080
I read 15 pages
and I will not read another page,

18:44.165 --> 18:46.625
nor another page
of any client you ever have.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.460
I need to get you behind this.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.337
I'm not behind this and I never will be.

18:50.421 --> 18:53.632
Well, listen: You'd better get behind
this if you want to save your ass.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.801
Save my ass? People love "Clouds," Ari.

18:55.885 --> 18:59.304
I will replace you and your whole
fucking crew with three phone calls.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.182
After this town hears how you tried
to bait and switch this studio,

19:02.266 --> 19:04.643
it will be your ass
that needs the saving.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.311
So, Dana, you're not gonna
take this to your boss?

19:06.395 --> 19:07.479
No!

19:07.563 --> 19:09.314
- Then I will.
- Really?

19:09.398 --> 19:11.817
Hi. Ari Gold to see Richard Wimmer.
Really.

19:11.901 --> 19:15.111
You motherfucking cocksucker!

19:15.238 --> 19:17.030
He's leaving for New York
in 30 minutes.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.075
- I'll only be a minute.
- No, he's in the shower!

19:20.910 --> 19:22.410
Ari! Ari!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.176
Dave.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.180
- Dave!
- I'm not a fighter, dawg, okay?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.808
But when it comes to my girl,
I will man up. So back off, okay?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.143
You're not fighting me, man.
You're fighting yourself here.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.187
Don't use that weird
existential shit with me.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.981
Dave, will you just
talk to me for one second

19:51.065 --> 19:52.524
before you go back over to her?

19:52.608 --> 19:53.692
- One...
- Listen...

19:53.776 --> 19:54.860
...one...
- Dave.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.361
...one... that was three seconds, dawg.

19:56.445 --> 19:59.114
What are you, six? Look,
you want to lose your girl, Dave?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.449
I'm telling you right now, you go back
over there with that attitude,

20:01.534 --> 20:02.742
that's exactly what's gonna happen.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.244
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.538
What the fuck, Dave?
You've come to cause more problems?

20:06.622 --> 20:08.415
Girl, I haven't caused shit, okay?
It's this guy.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.458
The only reason he's here
is to try and fuck you.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.377
- What?
- I'm just trying to do my job, Dave.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.045
- You need to get rid of him, okay?
- Dave!

20:14.130 --> 20:16.214
Baby, I'm just keeping it real.
Ask him. Ask him right now.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.883
Ask him to look you in the face
and say it isn't so.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.843
- Do it, come on.
- Dave, stop it.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.886
Maybe I should leave.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.095
Yeah, dawg,
why don't you do that, please?

20:22.179 --> 20:23.638
No, dawg, why don't you?

20:24.807 --> 20:25.891
I can't take it anymore!

20:25.975 --> 20:27.934
- I'm done.
- That shit ain't right.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.353
Stop fucking talking
like Randy Jackson!

20:32.356 --> 20:33.732
Whoa, okay.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.817
Whatever, movie star.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.278
I hope you two are really happy
together, all right?

20:47.038 --> 20:49.789
Well, that was awkward.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.166
Yeah. You all right?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.001
No, I meant for you.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.214
Okay, come on.
Let's get back to work.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.424
- Okay.
- Jesus.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.016
- It's Walsh.
- Finally.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.102
Yo, Billy! Where've you been all day?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.812
It's not Billy, Vince. It's Kat.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.773
Billy's locked himself
in the bathroom

21:14.857 --> 21:16.274
with a bottle of whiskey and a gun.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.151
What are you talking about?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.695
He thinks he let you down, Vince.
He feels terrible.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.322
No no no, he didn't let me down.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.658
Vince, E.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.826
Shh-shh! Let me talk to him.

21:26.911 --> 21:30.080
Billy? Baby, it's Vince.
He wants to talk to you.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.540
What's to say? I've ruined us all!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.626
No, baby, he says that it's all good.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.128
What's all good? He liked the script?

21:37.213 --> 21:38.713
Tell him I loved the script.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.882
He loved the script! Baby, he loved it.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.262
- You loved it?
- It's unbelievable.

21:46.347 --> 21:47.305
Do you really have a gun?

21:47.390 --> 21:49.683
Yeah, but the bitch
hid the bullets, so...

21:49.767 --> 21:53.019
Jesus, Billy. The script is amazing.
I want to make this movie.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.521
- You do?
- Yes.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.147
We're going to make this movie.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.358
- How?
- Ari's taking care of it. Don't worry.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.235
Ari? What can he do?

22:03.406 --> 22:05.657
Wow, it's like finding
Jim Morrison alive.

22:05.741 --> 22:08.785
Yeah, I had no cell all day. I got, like,
25 messages. What's going on?

22:08.869 --> 22:09.828
Nothing that exciting.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.663
Just have an emergency meeting
with the head of the studio

22:11.747 --> 22:13.748
on the Billy Walsh/Vinnie Chase project.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.042
- Why, what's the problem?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

22:16.127 --> 22:17.544
- Ari?
- Listen, you snooze, you lose.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.546
- I've got to go.
- Ari?

22:23.801 --> 22:25.176
What the hell is going on?

22:25.261 --> 22:27.512
Desperate times call for
desperate measures here.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.014
Thank god I'm in a robe.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.016
And may I comment on
what lovely ankles you have?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.268
- Talk fast, Ari.
- You don't have your summer movie.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.104
- Come again?
- A tent pole... you don't have one.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.439
I have "Clouds. "

22:37.523 --> 22:39.691
Billy Walsh and Vinnie Chase
don't wanna do it.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.401
Where the hell is Dana Gordon?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.278
I'm right outside the door, Richard!

22:43.362 --> 22:44.529
Ari locked me out.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.947
Let her in!

22:48.784 --> 22:50.535
- Hey, Dana.
- Fuck you, Ari.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.287
Dana, what the hell
is going on with "Clouds"?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.497
I am working on it, Richard,
and when you return from New York,

22:54.582 --> 22:56.291
I will have a completely
new team in place.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.210
That's impossible. Billy burned
six weeks writing the wrong script.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.337
And you do not have
enough time to put "Clouds"

23:01.422 --> 23:03.381
back onboard for your July release.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.884
You and your friend
Billy Walsh are dead, Ari!

23:05.968 --> 23:07.927
We are not dead.
We are very much alive.

23:08.012 --> 23:09.596
You with your fading stock prices

23:09.680 --> 23:11.723
and your three straight quarters
in the red are dead

23:11.807 --> 23:14.225
if you have to go to your board
of directors and tell them

23:14.310 --> 23:16.061
that this summer may be
your worst quarter yet.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.645
I'm gonna tear your head off, Ari.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.732
Please, don't,
because I have your summer movie.

23:20.816 --> 23:23.026
From the director of "Medellin"

23:23.110 --> 23:25.111
and "Queens Boulevard" comes "Silo. "

23:25.196 --> 23:28.490
It is a story of a group
of non-unionized farm hands

23:28.866 --> 23:31.951
who band together
to survive a nuclear attack

23:32.036 --> 23:34.788
after discovering
an underground society.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.749
It is ready to shoot.
Billy Walsh is onboard,

23:37.833 --> 23:39.626
Vinnie Chase is onboard,
and if you're not,

23:39.710 --> 23:42.712
Fox, Universal and Sony are.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.589
- He's bluffing.
- What does it matter?

23:44.673 --> 23:46.007
There's a summer movie in there,

23:46.092 --> 23:47.842
or we pack up our shit and go home.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.260
Tell him how good it is, Dana.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.262
All personal bullshit aside.

23:52.723 --> 23:53.848
Dana?

23:55.017 --> 23:58.144
- It's an excellent script.
- Can we market it?!

23:59.355 --> 24:01.898
Think "Blade Runner"
meets "Field of Dreams. "

24:02.066 --> 24:03.858
Two classics... boom!

24:03.984 --> 24:05.985
You make this good, Dana.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.738
And you, Ari, this I don't soon forget.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.908
That was unbelievable...

24:11.992 --> 24:13.576
"Blade Runner"
meets "Field of Dreams"?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.787
- Not bad, huh?
- That was... did you actually read it?

24:15.871 --> 24:17.997
What do I need to read it for?
I have a go movie, douchebag.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.791
- We have a go movie.
- Die, Ari.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.668
I truly hope you die.

24:22.837 --> 24:26.131
- Did I do it, Vinnie?
- Yes, you did, and thank you.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.675
So any possibility
of shooting this one

24:28.759 --> 24:30.885
a little closer to civilization, Bill, please?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.263
It takes place on a farm
in Nova Scotia, Turtle.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.807
Ignore him, Billy.
He read every third page.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.851
I, on the other hand, was riveted,

24:37.935 --> 24:40.854
especially by the character
of Kelton the farmhand.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.689
Yeah, I was thinking of you
when I wrote that.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.940
Really?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.567
No.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.986
How about a toast
to a groundbreaking day

24:48.070 --> 24:50.113
and a possibly
groundbreaking movie?

24:50.197 --> 24:52.574
Are you kissing
my ass now, snake suit?

24:52.658 --> 24:54.159
Oh, come on, Billy. He came through.

24:54.243 --> 24:55.493
You can't stay mad at him.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.121
I'm no longer planning on
using your car as a toilet,

24:58.205 --> 25:00.165
but I'll get back to you
about being my agent again.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.749
I wait with bated breath, sire.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.418
Yeah!

25:03.502 --> 25:05.086
Why does nobody answer
their cell phones?

25:05.171 --> 25:06.671
Look who's talking!

25:06.755 --> 25:09.090
Where've you been, E?
Too busy being professional

25:09.175 --> 25:10.717
with your girlfriend
to pick up the phone?

25:10.801 --> 25:12.302
Will somebody please
tell me what's going on?

25:12.386 --> 25:14.345
Don't stress your pretty
little head about it.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.347
- It's all been handled.
- What's been handled?

25:16.432 --> 25:18.474
We're making Billy's movie.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.394
"Silo"?

25:23.689 --> 25:26.274
Where's the snow?

25:27.305 --> 25:33.156
