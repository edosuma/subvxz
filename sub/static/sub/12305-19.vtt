WEBVTT

01:09.605 --> 01:10.981
A- ha, I win.

01:11.690 --> 01:13.400
Best out of three?

01:14.693 --> 01:15.694
All right.

01:15.736 --> 01:16.695
You're on.

01:16.820 --> 01:17.905
After the bridge.

01:17.946 --> 01:19.198
Done.

01:19.239 --> 01:20.491
Let's go.

02:06.495 --> 02:07.788
You okay?

02:15.421 --> 02:16.714
Hey!

02:33.689 --> 02:34.898
He could have crashed into the pylons.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.900
I didn't see what happened.

02:37.818 --> 02:40.487
How, uh... how fast do
you think he was going?

02:40.529 --> 02:41.447
He couldn't have been going that fast.

02:41.488 --> 02:45.492
I was out in front of him
and... we were taxiing.

02:45.993 --> 02:47.244
Okay.

02:47.286 --> 02:48.787
What's his name?

02:48.829 --> 02:50.289
I don't know.

02:50.497 --> 02:53.000
I just met him out here this morning.

02:53.083 --> 02:54.043
Okay. That's all right.

02:54.084 --> 02:56.545
We'll check his I.D.
When we get him out.

02:56.587 --> 02:58.881
Did you see anybody else
around the bridge or...

02:58.922 --> 03:01.091
- There's nobody.
- Okay.

03:01.133 --> 03:02.593
Officer?

03:02.801 --> 03:04.511
We'll have this officer
take your statement.

03:04.595 --> 03:06.013
Thanks a lot, ma'am. Take care.

03:06.096 --> 03:07.681
Yeah. You, too.

03:17.608 --> 03:19.401
Morning, Alexx.

03:19.443 --> 03:21.195
Morning, Horatio.

03:21.612 --> 03:23.572
Major skull damage.

03:23.614 --> 03:26.784
Frontal and parietal bones
appear to be fractured.

03:26.825 --> 03:29.787
If he was thrown from
that jet ski, Horatio,

03:29.912 --> 03:34.291
to have an impact injury this
severe, he must have been hauling ass.

03:34.333 --> 03:36.794
There's an awful lot of
blood on that jet ski, Alexx.

03:36.835 --> 03:37.920
I don't think he was thrown.

03:37.961 --> 03:40.297
I think he died on it.

03:40.381 --> 03:44.218
There appear to be some
dark flakes in his hair.

03:44.593 --> 03:48.180
He didn't hit something,
something hit him.

03:54.686 --> 03:59.400
So we have death... from above.

05:08.695 --> 05:11.031
Tripp says his name is Jim Farber,

05:11.073 --> 05:13.826
but the address doesn't
match up with his I.D.

05:13.867 --> 05:16.537
Forgive me- I don't
get out much, Calleigh,

05:16.578 --> 05:21.083
but tell me, who picks up a
woman on an early morning jet ski?

05:29.800 --> 05:33.095
I'll tell you- a man who was just
released from prison, that's who.

05:35.389 --> 05:37.349
Our boy did time, huh?

05:37.391 --> 05:39.476
He did eight years. He just got out.

05:39.601 --> 05:42.479
In fact, his first day of
freedom might have been today.

05:43.981 --> 05:46.775
Looks like our scuba
boy found something.

05:47.776 --> 05:49.778
Lucky for me.

05:55.784 --> 05:57.286
What have you got?

05:57.494 --> 05:59.872
I don't know. It's not like
any coral I've ever seen.

05:59.913 --> 06:01.081
What is it?

06:01.582 --> 06:03.292
Slate.

06:04.168 --> 06:09.590
Found them about five feet apart just
under the bridge, broken in half like this.

06:09.882 --> 06:11.884
That's an unusual color.

06:11.967 --> 06:15.596
You know, that looks like the debris
that was in our victim's scalp.

06:31.070 --> 06:33.572
I wonder what that writing means.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.824
I don't know. I have no idea.

06:35.866 --> 06:39.787
But I believe we just
found our murder weapon.

06:39.828 --> 06:41.205
Great.

06:54.385 --> 06:56.136
You hear what happened down there?

06:56.178 --> 07:00.974
Yeah. Some genius thought it would be funny to
throw a ten-pound piece of slate over the railing.

07:02.101 --> 07:03.143
Do me a favor.

07:03.185 --> 07:06.188
Check the rail for
prints and DNA, please.

07:06.271 --> 07:10.401
Come on. There's going to be 100 pedestrian prints
on there that have nothing to do with the crime.

07:10.442 --> 07:11.026
I'm sorry, Natalia.

07:11.068 --> 07:16.281
I thought you were aware of the fact that our
job doesn't afford us the luxury of assumption.

07:17.699 --> 07:20.077
Anyways, I got here first.

07:25.499 --> 07:27.167
Check this out.

07:36.385 --> 07:38.887
Somebody's been popping pills.

07:40.264 --> 07:43.100
Yeah, but they forgot one.

07:49.773 --> 07:53.986
Looks like it had a logo on it, but the
moisture must have caused it to erode.

07:55.070 --> 07:58.782
Well, people do some pretty crazy things
on drugs, and this crime would fit the bill.

07:58.991 --> 08:01.285
I think it deserves a closer look.

08:10.669 --> 08:14.590
I'm having the face-up side of the pill
mapped through an atomic force microscope.

08:14.631 --> 08:16.050
And it can read through the damage?

08:16.091 --> 08:21.388
It feels the surface on the
nanoscale using a mechanical probe.

08:23.891 --> 08:25.476
Y2K.

08:25.601 --> 08:28.687
These were all over the streets
when I was on patrol, but...

08:28.729 --> 08:30.939
I haven't heard about one
being around for years.

08:30.981 --> 08:33.734
Well, it looks like that's because
the federal narcotics division

08:33.775 --> 08:39.490
is believed to have seized the entire
supply back in 2000... from Jim Farber.

08:39.530 --> 08:42.326
He was our victim in
the jet ski accident.

08:42.366 --> 08:46.080
Well, if he was involved in drugs,
maybe his death wasn't an accident.

08:46.288 --> 08:49.875
Why don't we call the feds and see if
they can shine a little light on his past?

08:49.917 --> 08:50.876
Calleigh's out in the field.

08:51.001 --> 08:53.587
I'll have her head over.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.094
Y2K uppers.

09:01.095 --> 09:02.805
This brings back old memories.

09:02.846 --> 09:03.931
Where did you find it?

09:03.972 --> 09:08.268
A man that you arrested eight years
ago, Jim Farber, was killed today.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.104
We found that pill on the scene.

09:10.145 --> 09:11.688
I remember Jim.

09:11.897 --> 09:13.565
He made a whole lot of these.

09:13.607 --> 09:15.401
Almost 500 grams worth.

09:15.442 --> 09:16.652
I seized it all.

09:16.693 --> 09:17.903
Shut him down.

09:17.986 --> 09:19.530
Well, he served his time.

09:19.571 --> 09:21.073
I mean, that is until today.

09:21.198 --> 09:22.491
He's back on the
street with those pills.

09:22.533 --> 09:24.243
I mean, that can't be a coincidence.

09:24.284 --> 09:26.912
These guys always go
back to what they know.

09:26.995 --> 09:29.581
They dig up an old stash,
like these Y2K pills,

09:29.665 --> 09:31.750
puts them right back in the game.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.586
Do you think maybe our killer
didn't like what Jim was selling?

09:34.878 --> 09:36.880
Could have been a customer.

09:36.922 --> 09:38.841
Or maybe the competition.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.968
You wouldn't happen to
have any names, would you?

09:41.093 --> 09:44.471
Nah. Jim Farber wasn't prone
to giving up known associates.

09:44.513 --> 09:46.890
We tried to roll him over
about eight years ago.

09:46.932 --> 09:49.768
Turned down two grand and his freedom.

09:49.977 --> 09:53.147
Well, then, I guess that
information died with him today.

09:53.188 --> 09:55.566
Well, I'll tell you what. I'll
take a look at his old case file,

09:55.607 --> 09:57.484
and if something comes
up, I'll give you a call.

09:57.526 --> 09:59.903
That would be great. Thank you.

10:08.787 --> 10:10.122
I'm not sure I can help you.

10:10.164 --> 10:11.999
Flagstone's pretty common in Miami.

10:12.082 --> 10:13.625
I can't be the only guy selling it.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.879
No. But our research showed that you're
the only one who carries it in lavender.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.589
Could we see a piece of it, please?

10:18.630 --> 10:19.256
Yeah. Sure.

10:19.298 --> 10:21.383
I pulled a piece out.

10:24.386 --> 10:26.597
We call that October Dusk.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.974
Don't get many orders
for it. It's pretty rare.

10:29.016 --> 10:31.143
Never thought I'd see
it used to kill somebody.

10:31.185 --> 10:33.228
Yeah. Well, this is it;
this is definitely it.

10:33.270 --> 10:35.397
The piece that we have, though,
had some writing on the other side.

10:35.439 --> 10:37.399
Would that writing have
come from you guys, as well?

10:37.441 --> 10:39.401
No. It was probably the
folks that bought it.

10:39.443 --> 10:40.736
Sometimes customers mark them

10:40.778 --> 10:43.489
to remind them where they want
to put them on their properties.

10:46.992 --> 10:48.994
Do you have the customer's name?

10:49.036 --> 10:49.870
Yeah.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.584
Here you go.

10:55.667 --> 10:58.378
Yeah. A man named Henry
Woods signed for it.

11:00.089 --> 11:01.256
Thank you.

11:01.298 --> 11:03.092
Yeah. Sure thing.

11:03.801 --> 11:06.387
Isn't that Alexx's husband's name?

11:06.428 --> 11:08.764
The address confirms it.

11:12.184 --> 11:13.477
What are we going to do?
Should we tell Stetler?

11:13.519 --> 11:15.270
We tell no one.

11:15.771 --> 11:16.939
What are you going to do?

11:16.980 --> 11:19.983
I'm going to handle this... quietly.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.661
Hey, what brings you to these parts?

11:30.702 --> 11:32.996
Had to retrieve the
lab specimen from tox.

11:33.038 --> 11:34.581
Thought I'd drop by.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.501
Is this what dropped off the bridge?

11:37.543 --> 11:39.545
Yeah. This is flagstone.

11:39.586 --> 11:41.338
It's used for landscaping.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.048
Find any prints on it?

11:43.090 --> 11:44.842
No. Biscayne Bay took care of that,

11:44.883 --> 11:48.971
but I was hoping that this writing
would give us someone to chase.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.390
I think it's a pipe dream, though.

11:52.975 --> 11:56.395
"Left walk, Jamie window. "

11:56.979 --> 11:58.689
Dead end, right?

11:58.731 --> 12:00.274
Right.

12:05.279 --> 12:07.072
Tripp's waiting for me
in reception. I gotta go.

12:07.114 --> 12:09.032
Okay. I was just leaving.

12:09.074 --> 12:10.701
- See you later.
- All right.

12:19.501 --> 12:20.961
Hey, this is Henry Woods.

12:21.003 --> 12:23.088
Leave me a brief message after the beep.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.048
Henry, it's me.

12:24.089 --> 12:26.091
Um, listen, can you call me back?

12:26.133 --> 12:27.760
It's kind of important.

12:27.801 --> 12:31.305
About our walkway, our
yard, the flagstone.

12:31.388 --> 12:33.766
Please call me back when you get this.

13:10.886 --> 13:13.889
Look, Bryan just came in. I gotta go.

13:13.931 --> 13:15.432
I love you.

13:15.474 --> 13:19.269
Try to catch an earlier
flight if you can, okay?

13:22.481 --> 13:23.857
That dad?

13:23.899 --> 13:25.234
It was.

13:25.275 --> 13:27.194
Sounded serious.

13:27.277 --> 13:32.699
One of the flagstones from my
backyard was used to murder that man.

13:35.077 --> 13:38.580
Your father has no
idea how that happened.

13:39.873 --> 13:44.086
Bryan, I need you to be
completely honest with me.

13:44.128 --> 13:47.297
Who have you had over
to the house recently?

13:47.464 --> 13:52.177
Some guy gets killed and you immediately
suspect me or one of my friends?

13:52.219 --> 13:53.637
Jamie has people over, too.

13:53.679 --> 13:57.391
But I'm talking to you
right now, not your sister.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.977
And I need you to tell me the truth.

14:00.102 --> 14:01.895
- The truth.
- Yeah.

14:02.396 --> 14:05.065
How about the most likely scenario, mom?

14:05.190 --> 14:07.234
Somebody jumped the fence and swiped it.

14:07.276 --> 14:09.278
It doesn't take a csi
to figure that out.

14:09.319 --> 14:10.904
You need to mind yourself.

14:10.988 --> 14:13.741
Now, who have you had over to the house?

14:13.782 --> 14:17.494
Only person I've seen at the
house today, mom, was Mr. Caine.

14:19.997 --> 14:22.583
Horatio was at our house?

14:22.624 --> 14:23.876
In the backyard.

14:33.469 --> 14:36.597
He picked something out
of the grass and then left.

14:37.598 --> 14:39.475
I thought you knew.

14:40.768 --> 14:43.103
Go home right now, Bryan.

14:45.564 --> 14:48.192
Just go home, okay?

15:10.874 --> 15:12.584
Could we process that, please?

15:12.626 --> 15:13.919
A cigarette butt.

15:13.961 --> 15:16.129
Is this related to the
dead jet-skier case?

15:16.171 --> 15:20.259
It is. It was recovered from
where the slate was taken.

15:20.467 --> 15:23.095
So you know who the
murder weapon belongs to.

15:23.136 --> 15:24.346
Potentially.

15:24.388 --> 15:25.556
I'm on it.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.474
Thank you, ma'am.

16:04.094 --> 16:05.971
how long is this taking, man?

16:06.096 --> 16:08.640
I got a cabana on the
beach with my name on it.

16:08.682 --> 16:13.270
We recovered a cigarette, Trey, that
places you at the Woods' residence.

16:13.462 --> 16:15.881
DNA? wow.

16:15.922 --> 16:17.966
Bryan Woods is a friend of mine.

16:18.008 --> 16:20.344
The crew likes to hang there
when his folks are gone.

16:20.844 --> 16:23.513
Hey, Bryan, your parents
keep any beer around here?

16:26.433 --> 16:27.434
I'm sorry.

16:27.517 --> 16:30.020
I didn't see the "no smoking" signs.

16:30.062 --> 16:32.314
What's the big deal?

16:32.356 --> 16:34.524
"What is the big deal?"

16:35.734 --> 16:41.615
A piece of slate that was removed from
that yard was used to kill a man, Trey.

16:41.657 --> 16:43.241
That's the big deal.

16:56.129 --> 16:58.632
I don't know anything about that.

16:59.841 --> 17:02.427
You have a record, Trey.

17:02.469 --> 17:03.470
Come on.

17:03.512 --> 17:05.638
Threw a rock through
a window a year ago.

17:05.681 --> 17:08.224
And now you've escalated to murder.

17:10.435 --> 17:13.146
Now, why the hell would
I want to do that for?

17:14.231 --> 17:18.527
We recovered some speed
at the scene, Trey.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.904
I never touch that stuff.

17:20.945 --> 17:27.536
Look, this piece of slate you're
talking about wasn't found in my yard.

17:27.828 --> 17:32.332
If you weren't so busy being
all chummy with Bryan's mom...

17:32.833 --> 17:36.336
maybe you'd grill him about
that instead of me, huh?

17:37.129 --> 17:39.339
I'm out of here.

17:58.317 --> 17:59.609
dr. Woods.

17:59.651 --> 18:00.527
Mom!

18:00.569 --> 18:01.403
Bryan?

18:01.445 --> 18:04.406
Mom, please, I'm in trouble.

18:04.448 --> 18:05.365
What happened?

18:05.407 --> 18:08.035
I don't know what happened!
You have to do something!

18:08.118 --> 18:08.869
Where are you?

18:08.910 --> 18:11.538
At this warehouse, grove and third.

18:11.580 --> 18:14.041
Mom, please, I need help. Hurry.

18:14.082 --> 18:16.543
I'm on my way. Stay there, okay?

18:36.021 --> 18:37.439
Bryan?

18:47.824 --> 18:49.326
Bryan?!

18:53.121 --> 18:54.831
Bryan?!

19:05.425 --> 19:07.010
Bryan!

19:21.233 --> 19:22.859
what did you do?

19:22.901 --> 19:24.611
Nothing, I swear.

19:24.653 --> 19:26.321
He was in pain.

19:26.947 --> 19:29.116
he begged me to pull it out.

19:34.037 --> 19:37.708
that was the worst possible
thing you could have done!

19:38.125 --> 19:41.920
We got to stop this bleeding,
or this boy is gonna die.

19:42.337 --> 19:44.381
Go wait in the car.

19:44.423 --> 19:47.009
- Mom, I...
- get in the car!

20:11.616 --> 20:12.492
I have an emergency.

20:12.534 --> 20:16.913
A boy has been stabbed, and
I need an ambulance, please.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.209
You just hold now.

20:21.251 --> 20:22.294
Don't die.

20:22.336 --> 20:23.920
Please don't die.

20:38.144 --> 20:39.103
Got him stabilized.

20:39.145 --> 20:41.105
Blood pressure is 112/70.

20:41.147 --> 20:42.857
Is there anything I should know?

20:42.940 --> 20:45.401
The blade may have hit
a renal artery branch.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.862
I used quikclot; standard
pressure wasn't enough.

20:47.904 --> 20:48.988
Got it.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.907
We got a 16-year-old
stab victim.

20:50.948 --> 20:52.325
Situation at scene has have stabilized.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.243
Transporting him immediately
to county hospital.

20:56.829 --> 20:58.414
It's Trey Holt.

20:58.456 --> 21:01.751
It's our lead suspect
in the bridge murder.

21:02.126 --> 21:03.795
Yeah.

21:03.836 --> 21:06.047
What about you, Alexx?
What are you doing here?

21:06.089 --> 21:08.132
What's your connection to this?

21:08.549 --> 21:10.551
My son.

21:13.429 --> 21:15.098
Was Bryan here?

21:15.139 --> 21:16.182
He pulled the knife out.

21:16.224 --> 21:17.266
He didn't stab that boy.

21:17.350 --> 21:18.893
He pulled the knife out.

21:18.935 --> 21:20.436
Where is he right now?

21:20.561 --> 21:21.980
He's inside my car.

21:22.021 --> 21:23.439
Come on. Let's go.

21:28.945 --> 21:29.821
I don't understand.

21:29.862 --> 21:31.614
I told him to wait in the car.

21:31.656 --> 21:34.742
This makes him a suspect,
Alexx; fleeing a crime scene.

21:36.953 --> 21:38.079
This isn't good.

21:38.121 --> 21:39.205
I have to run this.

21:39.247 --> 21:43.001
Listen, my son pulled that knife out.

21:43.042 --> 21:49.632
If you run those prints, it'll be his name and
his face and he'll go on record as a suspect.

21:50.550 --> 21:54.262
Once everyone knows something,
they can't unknow it.

21:56.264 --> 21:59.058
He didn't stab that boy.

22:03.354 --> 22:05.023
Is that what he told you?

22:05.106 --> 22:06.733
Eric, he didn't stab him.

22:11.738 --> 22:15.533
Protocol says I have to run
the blood on this first for DNA.

22:15.658 --> 22:17.952
I can hold off on running
the prints for now.

22:17.994 --> 22:18.995
Thank you.

22:19.037 --> 22:21.539
Don't thank me. Just go find your son.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.626
Find him.

22:32.550 --> 22:35.011
Got a jackknife in here. It's priority.

22:35.053 --> 22:39.349
Strong possibility it's going to be it's going
to be Alexx's son's prints on that handle.

22:40.266 --> 22:42.935
She says he pulled it out of the victim.

22:43.561 --> 22:46.439
Right now, we need to
focus on who stabbed him.

22:47.148 --> 22:49.400
Okay, um... okay.

22:49.442 --> 22:54.739
Then I can swab between the
hilt and the blade for DNA.

22:55.865 --> 22:58.159
And it won't compromise the print.

22:59.535 --> 23:01.204
Thank you.

23:01.245 --> 23:06.459
I've seen epithelials get stuck in the
hilt of these jackknives from time to time.

23:12.465 --> 23:15.635
So what do we do if it is Alexx's son?

23:15.760 --> 23:17.345
Then what?

23:21.432 --> 23:24.936
Then we have no choice. We have to
treat him like any other suspect.

23:38.241 --> 23:39.826
we got a CODIS hit.

23:43.830 --> 23:45.540
I don't believe it.

23:48.459 --> 23:52.255
So, Mary's been a busy little girl.

23:52.296 --> 23:54.007
I'm sorry, why am I here?

23:54.048 --> 23:59.053
We have you stabbing Trey Holt in the back
at the Grove Street warehouse this afternoon.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.849
It wasn't me.

24:03.933 --> 24:08.021
See, Mary, a knife blade cuts both ways.

24:08.062 --> 24:12.233
And the DNA that we've
recovered says it's you.

24:15.445 --> 24:17.947
Hey, where the hell are you guys?

24:22.535 --> 24:25.330
Now, Trey's in serious
condition at dade general.

24:25.371 --> 24:27.957
If he dies, you're
going to need our help.

24:28.249 --> 24:30.960
What were you two doing
in the warehouse today?

24:38.843 --> 24:40.762
I paid Trey.

24:40.845 --> 24:43.723
And I expected something in return.

24:43.765 --> 24:47.560
And he promised and he
promised, and he never delivered.

24:47.602 --> 24:51.147
The Y2K pills.

24:52.732 --> 24:54.400
How did you know about that?

24:54.442 --> 24:56.736
Your jet ski
fling- Jim Farber.

24:56.778 --> 24:58.196
He used to deal them.

24:58.237 --> 24:59.530
You lied to me at the beach.

24:59.656 --> 25:01.449
You knew who he was.

25:01.658 --> 25:04.452
You lure him to the bridge, Trey
drops a big rock on his head.

25:04.494 --> 25:06.454
Which killed him, Mary.

25:06.496 --> 25:08.456
Were you in on that?

25:11.959 --> 25:14.462
I think you should just
book me for the stabbing.

25:14.504 --> 25:15.463
You do, huh?

25:15.505 --> 25:17.131
I do.

25:17.632 --> 25:20.802
I know how this works. I do.

25:20.843 --> 25:24.764
You get me to talk and before
you know it, I'm your puppet.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.354
Book me.

25:36.734 --> 25:38.027
Yeah.

25:38.528 --> 25:39.821
Okay.

25:39.862 --> 25:41.030
Horatio...

25:41.155 --> 25:44.158
patrol just spotted the
Woods boy- at tolson bridge.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.952
Thank you, Frank.

25:45.994 --> 25:46.661
Oh, Frank...

25:46.703 --> 25:47.704
Yeah?

25:47.745 --> 25:49.455
Book Mary.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.435
Put your weapons down, please.

26:11.936 --> 26:13.938
Put it down.

26:19.944 --> 26:21.738
You okay, Bryan?

26:21.863 --> 26:23.656
What is all this?

26:23.698 --> 26:25.450
I don't know.

26:31.664 --> 26:33.041
These are them, H.

26:33.166 --> 26:34.834
These are Y2K pills.

26:34.876 --> 26:36.544
What does that mean?

26:36.836 --> 26:38.629
It means you're coming with us.

26:38.671 --> 26:40.256
Officer.

26:56.230 --> 27:01.736
Bryan... where did you get the pills?

27:03.529 --> 27:05.907
I was going to throw
them out, that's all.

27:05.948 --> 27:10.536
So someone gave you that
bag to dispose of, right?

27:10.578 --> 27:11.954
You're saying that, not me.

27:11.996 --> 27:13.831
Wait a minute, Bryan.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.292
Now, see, we're here to help you.

27:16.334 --> 27:18.753
One of those pills was
found at a crime scene.

27:18.795 --> 27:20.630
I had nothing to do with it.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.465
Okay, then help us prove that.

27:25.426 --> 27:27.136
Please.

27:30.765 --> 27:35.436
I need the name of the person
that handed you that bag.

27:40.858 --> 27:42.360
Bryan...

27:43.152 --> 27:44.821
you have to understand...

27:44.904 --> 27:46.531
Bryan, I need the name.

27:47.740 --> 27:50.827
Lieutenant, I can't help you.

27:53.162 --> 27:53.913
Hang on a second, Alexx.

27:53.955 --> 27:58.126
Bryan, that is the key to this.

28:05.758 --> 28:08.845
Now, I'm sorry about this, Horatio...

28:10.263 --> 28:13.433
but this interview is over.

28:15.143 --> 28:17.061
Alexx...

28:17.937 --> 28:21.357
if you take this
position, I can't help him.

28:24.152 --> 28:25.445
We need a lawyer.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.030
Alexx...

28:58.738 --> 29:02.575
Hey. I know I can't come in.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.161
I heard Bryan won't talk.

29:07.372 --> 29:10.083
Is that the plastic bag he
was holding on the bridge?

29:10.166 --> 29:12.835
No, Alexx, we didn't find
Bryan holding a plastic bag.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.420
He was holding a paper bag.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.465
This bag was inside of
it holding the pills.

29:18.341 --> 29:20.677
And if you find his prints on it...

29:20.718 --> 29:22.971
maybe you catch him in a lie, huh?

29:23.471 --> 29:27.141
Alexx, maybe we can tie
this bag to another suspect.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.852
Maybe somebody put him up to it.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.360
Yeah, these are my prints all
right. Where'd you find them?

30:19.402 --> 30:22.405
Off a bag of Y2K pills.

30:22.447 --> 30:26.743
Well, looks like Jim Farber's getting
pretty serious about his favorite pills.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.537
How did your prints end up on his drugs?

30:29.662 --> 30:36.169
Listen, lieutenant, I hand deliver bags of phony
drugs to prearranged contacts all over Miami.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.546
They're sold and then distributed.

30:38.671 --> 30:41.341
How the hell do I know where they
wind up by the time we make the bust?

30:41.466 --> 30:46.262
What you're telling me is the bag was
refilled with speed without your knowledge?

30:46.304 --> 30:50.016
What I'm saying is that
druggies reuse bags all the time.

30:50.058 --> 30:53.770
You'll probably find a hundred
of them with my mitts on them.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.650
Look, I know you're trying to
solve a murder here, lieutenant.

30:58.691 --> 31:00.652
But I'm not your guy.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.340
Just leave me alone.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.176
I'm your mother.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.761
Come on.

31:29.055 --> 31:33.267
Sorry if I'm embarrassing
you in front of your friends.

31:33.643 --> 31:35.853
My friends?

31:37.772 --> 31:40.733
Those people are officers of the law.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.319
And they took an oath
to solve this murder.

31:43.361 --> 31:49.951
And right now, all of the evidence is
pointing them directly to Bryan Woods.

31:50.076 --> 31:56.374
Now, maybe in the backs of their minds
they're hoping it's not you, for my sake.

31:57.959 --> 32:01.254
But once you get in front of
that jury there won't be any hope.

32:01.296 --> 32:04.799
Those 12 people won't know
me, they won't know you,

32:04.841 --> 32:10.638
and they definitely won't know that you're
covering for someone you think is your friend.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.057
I never said I was covering for anybody.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.268
You know what they will know?

32:15.476 --> 32:19.939
They will know that that murder
weapon came from your backyard.

32:20.064 --> 32:23.359
That you were caught on that
bridge with illegal drugs.

32:23.401 --> 32:26.654
Now, how do you think
that's going to look to them?

32:27.947 --> 32:31.868
- Like I did it?
- Yeah, like you did it.

32:31.951 --> 32:36.664
And when that judge reads
the verdict, guilty...

32:38.041 --> 32:40.460
I don't want to to go to jail.

32:42.045 --> 32:49.552
Then please... tell Horatio
who gave you that bag.

32:55.058 --> 33:00.855
You always say your word is your bond.

33:04.651 --> 33:07.236
I gave my word.

33:08.947 --> 33:16.371
Baby, you don't give your word
to drug pushers and murderers.

33:17.038 --> 33:23.169
You save it for the people that
care about you- that you care about.

33:29.968 --> 33:32.470
Trey called.

33:35.974 --> 33:39.268
He said he was hanging at the warehouse.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.854
He asked me to come down.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.776
When I got there...

33:49.237 --> 33:51.364
it was bad.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.741
Trey, what happened?

33:55.243 --> 33:57.161
Pull it out.

33:57.537 --> 34:00.248
- What I'm I supposed...
- it hurts, man. Just pull it out.

34:01.666 --> 34:03.459
Come on, pull it out.

34:08.547 --> 34:13.261
you gotta go to my place and get the pills
out of there before Mary gets to them.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.763
You could dump them if you have to.

34:20.059 --> 34:22.853
Trey took the slate from our backyard.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.940
He said he needed it for something.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.069
I let him.

34:44.042 --> 34:48.670
You took the slate from Bryan Woods's
backyard and used it as a murder weapon,

34:48.713 --> 34:50.340
didn't you, Trey?

35:00.850 --> 35:02.352
Okay.

35:02.852 --> 35:05.563
I'm way over my head.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.442
Look, the feds set me up.

35:11.569 --> 35:13.446
Excuse me?

35:14.656 --> 35:18.451
I got busted on drug
possession about a month ago.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.454
I made a deal.

35:22.163 --> 35:25.458
I signed up to be a snitch with them.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.756
Are you trying to tell me that
you're a federal informant?

35:33.549 --> 35:35.969
They scooped Mary, too.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.056
They gave us all the
speed that we wanted.

35:40.348 --> 35:42.767
The Y2K stuff.

35:44.060 --> 35:47.438
All I had to do was give
them the names of the sellers.

35:48.439 --> 35:50.775
Then it all changed.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.653
Then the deal was...

35:55.863 --> 35:58.116
kill this guy...

35:58.157 --> 36:00.368
or you go to prison.

36:02.036 --> 36:05.373
Are you working for agent Sylvestri?

36:05.415 --> 36:08.251
Agent Brent Sylvestri.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.549
Trey Holt and Mary Landis, yes.

36:14.590 --> 36:16.342
They agreed to work for me.

36:16.467 --> 36:20.346
To escape jail time, but I certainly
didn't have them kill anybody.

36:20.388 --> 36:23.141
Trey Holt confessed tovois
in hlvement in the murder.

36:23.182 --> 36:24.267
Yours, too.

36:24.309 --> 36:25.310
Come on, guys.

36:25.351 --> 36:26.603
It's his word against mine.

36:26.644 --> 36:31.149
Agent Sylvestri, we have a
warrant to search your home.

36:31.357 --> 36:33.109
What are you expecting to find?

36:33.151 --> 36:36.571
The Y2K pills you seized from
Jim Farber eight years ago.

36:37.363 --> 36:41.367
You busted him with ammo gr45s, but there
was a lot more than that, wasn't there?

36:41.451 --> 36:45.538
You pocketed the rest and he threatened
to expose you if you didn't get them back.

36:46.164 --> 36:47.624
Right?

36:47.665 --> 36:51.461
That's when you ordered
Mary to kill him. Right?

36:51.544 --> 36:56.257
So Mary lures Jim under the bridge,
and Trey drops the slate on him.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.912
And then what, agent?

37:25.954 --> 37:27.664
You wanted to take her out?

37:28.164 --> 37:31.668
A lot of bodies piling up
just to cover up what you did.

37:31.709 --> 37:34.545
Look, the Y2K were better than money.

37:34.963 --> 37:37.757
When you have something
that an addict wants...

37:37.799 --> 37:39.842
they don't stray far.

37:40.468 --> 37:42.428
Junkies don't deserve government money.

37:42.470 --> 37:45.431
Well, your informants didn't
deserve to be blackmailed either.

37:45.473 --> 37:49.435
You guys are under the false impression
that somebody actually even cares.

37:50.353 --> 37:59.237
The people I deal with, their entire
existence is devoted to chasing the next fix.

37:59.279 --> 38:01.572
They're parasites.

38:01.614 --> 38:03.825
Just like you.

38:03.866 --> 38:08.955
So you see, agent, you are my guy.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.937
is there any word on my son?

38:32.979 --> 38:34.647
There is.

38:35.940 --> 38:41.070
Bryan will be released to
your custody today, Alexx.

38:41.112 --> 38:43.072
Thank you.

38:47.577 --> 38:49.746
This room...

38:50.872 --> 38:53.875
used to bring me so much peace.

38:53.916 --> 38:56.794
I know that sounds strange, but...

38:56.836 --> 39:00.256
we meet people on the
worst day of their life.

39:00.298 --> 39:04.761
And I always felt that it was my duty...

39:05.470 --> 39:07.013
to be the last voice they heard,

39:07.055 --> 39:12.060
and I never- not
once- took that lightly.

39:12.101 --> 39:15.772
I almost lost my son today, Horatio.

39:18.650 --> 39:22.236
But, Alexx-
you didn't.

39:22.946 --> 39:25.198
You didn't.

39:25.239 --> 39:32.455
But after today, this room
just doesn't feel the same.

39:33.373 --> 39:38.753
I need to spend more of my
time taking care of the living.

39:42.674 --> 39:50.139
It has been my honor to
work with you, Mr. Caine.

39:51.140 --> 39:53.226
Back at you.

39:53.268 --> 39:58.314
And, Alexx, that door...

39:58.356 --> 40:03.361
will always be open. Okay?

40:06.864 --> 40:08.700
I, uh...

40:08.741 --> 40:10.576
Go ahead.

40:39.772 --> 40:44.861
You... are my last one.
