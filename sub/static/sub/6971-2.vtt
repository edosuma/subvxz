00:01.127 --> 00:03.163
DUTCH:
Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.254 --> 00:05.666
You, uh,
recognize this kid?

00:05.756 --> 00:06.745
Nope.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.664
A Killjoy has
a warrant for our son.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.670
Those guys don’t come
looking for you to say hello.

00:11.304 --> 00:13.636
Did you just
try to shoot me?

00:13.723 --> 00:15.213
What do you know
about what's really
going on?

00:15.308 --> 00:16.548
ZEPH: Everyone
on this moon

00:16.642 --> 00:19.179
is under some sort
of mass hypnosis.

00:19.478 --> 00:20.729
(DEVICE BEEPING)
No,no,no,no.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.601
She's awake. How?

00:25.109 --> 00:26.940
Never underestimate
my girls.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.396
DUTCH: Kendry!

00:28.487 --> 00:29.693
Do you know who I am?

00:29.906 --> 00:31.817
I've been
trying to forget you
since the day we met.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.322
What is going on
in Westerley?

00:33.701 --> 00:34.781
SEYAH: Terraforming.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.275
Want to see?

00:37.413 --> 00:38.528
(CHUCKLES)

00:38.789 --> 00:40.404
ZEPH: High stress levels
trigger the decon bracelets

00:40.499 --> 00:42.455
and the showers encode
a false memory.

00:42.627 --> 00:44.037
It's like
|itera| brainwashing.

00:44.128 --> 00:46.119
Yalena Yardeen, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.670
What do we do?
Take this.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.963
I can't do this
without you, Zeph.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.958
No! (GROANS)

00:54.013 --> 00:55.423
THE LADY: She’s all alone now.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.350
Then why are you
so scared of her?

01:05.524 --> 01:06.730
MAN OVER PA: Remember,

01:06.859 --> 01:09.020
you’re never far
from a decon shower.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.562
Take a moment to locate
the showers nearest to you.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.075
Not here, beat it.
I haven't got
a lot of time.

01:18.371 --> 01:19.360
Did you get
what I asked for?

01:19.872 --> 01:21.408
This is a relationship
business.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.577
As in, if you want to do
business with me,

01:23.668 --> 01:26.501
we need to have
a relationship.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.294
Yeah, sorry.
I'm not a relationship
type of person.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.672
Relax. I know
who you are.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.332
You do?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.835
YaIa. From the Royale.

01:36.681 --> 01:38.842
No shame in buying
a little street heat

01:39.016 --> 01:40.131
to dull the pain.

01:40.226 --> 01:41.386
Right.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.718
Vikes, and...

01:44.939 --> 01:47.476
What's a gal like you want
with antibiotics?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.187
I'm gonna snort it.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.275
In a drug person way.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.062
(CHUCKLES) Nice.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.861
And how you want
to pay for that?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.657
So are my balls, honey,
but that don't
buy me dinner.

02:05.793 --> 02:06.828
(CLANGING)

02:06.919 --> 02:08.329
MAN:
Get out of here,
you damn drunk.

02:10.423 --> 02:11.412
Sorry, friend.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.832
Who you calling friend?

02:16.470 --> 02:19.382
Zeph. How are you doing?
Are you okay?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.758
I got what you asked for.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.216
Good, because
I'm about to pass out.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.103
DUTCH: Ugh!

02:25.187 --> 02:26.176
Where's your healing wand?

02:26.439 --> 02:27.929
ZEPH: Doesn't matter,
something's stuck in there.

02:28.024 --> 02:29.104
You're gonna
have to operate.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.353
Okay, you're up.

02:31.444 --> 02:32.433
Try not to kill me.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.852
Zeph? Zephl

02:35.281 --> 02:37.237
Oh, shit.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.743
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

02:39.827 --> 02:41.818
Ooh, ooh

02:42.538 --> 02:44.199
Ooh, ooh

02:45.207 --> 02:47.698
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

02:48.836 --> 02:50.667
Ooh, ooh

03:00.848 --> 03:02.804
WOMAN OVER PA:
Keep your family safe.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.592
Decon shower just in case.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.145
Hey!

03:11.484 --> 03:12.473
Oh, sorry.

03:12.568 --> 03:13.603
Wrong woman.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.854
Creep.

03:17.823 --> 03:18.983
(EXHALES)

03:23.120 --> 03:24.109
You'll never catch her.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.996
lwill if you help me.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.582
And why would
I help you catch
my wife?

03:31.295 --> 03:33.251
Because if I don't...

03:34.673 --> 03:35.799
Someone else will.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.582
You know what?

03:37.927 --> 03:39.133
Find another bar.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.342
We're closed.

03:45.768 --> 03:48.350
DUTCH: Hey. Stop passing out.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.721
(GROANS)

03:52.191 --> 03:53.271
I smell egg.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.267
Did you make yourself
a sandwich while
I was unconscious?

03:56.529 --> 03:58.269
Why, is it against
your fancy medical rules?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.395
Yes!

03:59.490 --> 04:01.401
Did you even
scrub up afterwards?

04:01.534 --> 04:02.740
(GROANS)

04:02.827 --> 04:03.907
Hey, you need
to stay awake.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.240
Come on, talk to me
about science things.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.117
Do you think
we can really
figure out a way

04:09.250 --> 04:10.490
to wake people up?

04:11.293 --> 04:12.544
In theory.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.793
Between the showers
and the rain

04:14.880 --> 04:19.465
this Lady of yours is
obviously using engineered
proteins to rewrite memories.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.627
If I can
create an inhibitor,
I should be able to...

04:22.721 --> 04:24.632
Argh! I need
more pain meds!

04:24.723 --> 04:25.712
No,no,no,
just hang in there.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.048
You're maxed out.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.221
Can you feel
anything in there?

04:29.478 --> 04:31.389
Some kind
of bone shard?

04:31.522 --> 04:32.682
You have to pull it out!

04:32.773 --> 04:33.933
This is why I ate first.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.439
(SQUEALING)

04:35.526 --> 04:36.732
Good! No, gross!

04:37.445 --> 04:40.027
Gods, this is not
a splinter!
Do you want me to stop?

04:40.197 --> 04:42.028
I want you to
hurry up, woman!

04:43.033 --> 04:45.490
I mean, relax, sweetie,
you're doing great.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.608
You're such
a good doctor.

04:46.704 --> 04:48.319
No,no,no.
Don't you dare!

04:48.497 --> 04:50.362
Not unless you want
a second belly button.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.198
(GASPS)

04:53.919 --> 04:54.908
Got it.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.415
Okay. Good.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.623
Now sew me up
and let's never talk
about this again.

05:01.427 --> 05:02.416
Sew?

05:03.262 --> 05:04.251
What's the problem?

05:04.930 --> 05:07.182
Besides it being
prehistoric...

05:08.392 --> 05:09.677
l-l don't know how to sew.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.020
I thought you said you were
a princess in your old life.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.016
Yeah, definitely not
that kind of princess.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.349
Oh, tits.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.696
Why does this have to be
the one thing you're shit at?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.914
All right, people,
you know the drill.

05:35.461 --> 05:36.917
This is a Black Warrant.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.210
So the danger is high,

05:39.465 --> 05:42.332
and the reward, ooh,
is it sweet.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.671
Our target?
Yala.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.928
Your target has a name.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.719
That she does.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.760
Ya|a Yardeen
lived and worked
right here.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.941
Odds are she's
somewhere nearby

05:58.108 --> 05:59.814
being hidden by
someone she knows.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.901
First one to find her
gets the prize.

06:09.161 --> 06:10.571
I told you,
you don't need
to be here

06:10.788 --> 06:11.994
while we shake
the place down.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.453
I got nothing to hide.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.953
Plus I want to be here
when she gets back.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.579
So what's
a Black Warrant
anyways?

06:23.551 --> 06:25.132
Open competitive warrant.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.043
Brings out
all the top Killjoys.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.425
Only the best
for my girl.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.803
It's a Level Five, John.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.519
A kill warrant.

06:35.980 --> 06:36.969
Pree.

06:37.106 --> 06:38.437
She's a bartender.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.060
What the hells
are you doing?

06:46.282 --> 06:48.614
They're calling her
The Widow.

06:49.577 --> 06:50.817
Well, that's just
poor research.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.900
I'm standing right here.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.911
Word is she killed
her first husband.

06:55.499 --> 06:56.659
First husband?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.411
And that she's
a terrorist for hire.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.619
Whoa. Go back to that
first husband part.

07:01.922 --> 07:02.911
Look.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.332
You're as much
a victim here as anyone.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.126
You don't owe her
shit anymore.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.972
So do yourself a favor
and tell me how
to find her.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.977
Where's Yala?

07:25.070 --> 07:26.526
Hey, Johnny boy.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.400
Turin's looking for you.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.526
Better watch your back.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.700
The dealer with the hair?
What the hell does he want?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.037
He says your wife
stiffed him.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.040
Ya|a was buying drugs?

07:37.124 --> 07:38.330
Buying, yeah.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.453
Paying, not so much.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.167
How do you feel about
watching the Royale
for a bit?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.204
No thanks.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.585
I don't really see myself
as a bartender, you know?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.086
I'll see you.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.177
Everyone out!
We're closing early.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.926
Hello?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.191
Hello!

08:03.734 --> 08:05.144
Is anybody home?

08:06.111 --> 08:07.442
D'AVlN: We're closed.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.986
Ha. Funny.

08:12.701 --> 08:13.690
Do you mind?

08:13.911 --> 08:15.447
D'AVlN: Ship, lights.

08:21.752 --> 08:23.162
You'll never find Yala.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.247
Haven't we
already had this
conversation?

08:25.631 --> 08:26.620
I've got a lead.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.505
So about your offer?

08:29.385 --> 08:30.374
I'm in.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.591
VVhy?

08:31.679 --> 08:33.715
Because this whole city
is hunting my wife,

08:33.806 --> 08:35.091
and I need
to find her first.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.675
And for whatever reason...

08:39.019 --> 08:40.555
she trusted you.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.140
So if I'm gonna help you,

08:43.816 --> 08:46.478
you have to promise
to bring her in alive.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.705
(GROANS)
Oh, good, you're awake.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.658
Come on. Upsy-daisy.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.829
Are you serious?

09:03.836 --> 09:05.121
I know,
I know, I know.

09:05.629 --> 09:06.789
D'avin's a really
good tracker,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.745
it's only
a matter of time
before he finds me.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.172
So we need to
shut down these
factories

09:10.509 --> 09:11.498
before that happens.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.004
I thought he was
your family.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.589
Yeah, but he doesn't
remember that.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.463
Okay, well, I guess
my brain's not injured.

09:17.641 --> 09:18.630
I can do this.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.300
If I don't die
of sepsis first.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.635
All right.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.813
So this Lady of yours
has us re-terraforming
our own planet,

09:26.108 --> 09:27.769
so we just have to
figure out why.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.061
Whys are for later.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.443
We need to figure out
how to shut this
shit down now.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.187
Focus,Zeph.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.407
There must be
some kind of weakness,
or sabotage point.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.070
What do we do
to find it?

09:38.162 --> 09:39.242
More information.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.740
Okay, good.
How do we get it?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.662
Well, I've unlocked
this slate.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.781
But the Company keeps
their high-value data

09:44.918 --> 09:45.907
on encrypted passkeys.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.584
Only a couple of guards
have access.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.127
If I could get my hands
on one of those...

09:49.214 --> 09:50.329
Okay, good.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.005
One passkey coming right up.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.000
Wait, you're gonna
go out there

09:54.178 --> 09:55.463
with all those Killjoys
on your tail?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.090
Believe me,
that's the least
of our problems.

10:02.186 --> 10:03.426
What?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.275
Do you like her?

10:17.785 --> 10:18.774
Who is she?

10:19.203 --> 10:20.943
What is this?

10:25.459 --> 10:26.448
Wait.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.337
What are you doing?

10:31.715 --> 10:32.875
Help!

10:33.050 --> 10:36.383
Help! Help me!

10:37.888 --> 10:39.549
(SCREAMING)

10:59.952 --> 11:01.237
Who are you?

11:01.745 --> 11:03.701
You know who I am.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.950
We're well acquainted.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.869
Now you know what I can do.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.665
You still think
I fear your Yala?

11:14.091 --> 11:15.752
Perhaps I'll wear
her next.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.105
(WHISTLING)

11:32.192 --> 11:34.103
MAN OVER PA:
Don’t forget to decontaminate.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.059
Take a moment to locate
the nearest shower.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.356
Well, well, well.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.948
Just the man
I was hoping
to run into.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.526
I heard you ran
into my wife.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.237
Not as hard as I will
once I find her again.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.777
About that.
We have a proposition.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.069
Well, hot damn.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.995
Does it involve me
throat-punching
one of you two?

11:48.250 --> 11:50.332
No. It involves
you telling us
what you know

11:50.460 --> 11:52.792
about Yalena Yardeen.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.749
Now.

11:57.676 --> 12:00.008
You team up with a Killjoy
to turn in your own wife?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.926
That is some
tacky shit, son.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.254
Who raised you?

12:03.849 --> 12:05.339
Go flash your
fascist-pig pistol

12:05.559 --> 12:06.799
at some dumbass girl
that cares.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.509
'Cause we're not
afraid of you, hoss.

12:10.606 --> 12:11.686
Shit.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.389
You sure?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.182
And I bought him lunch.

12:16.778 --> 12:17.813
It's okay.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.190
He'll get what's
coming to him.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.488
The scales always balance.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.775
You know, you seem
pretty relaxed

12:24.912 --> 12:25.992
for a man
with a gun on you.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.235
Yeah, well.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.120
I've made my peace
with this world.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.493
This is my time,
it's my time.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.871
Also your wife
pissed me off.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.454
I ain't doing squat
to help you two
little lovebirds reunite.

12:39.801 --> 12:40.790
Okay.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.383
What if I let you
punch him?
What?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.463
I'm listening.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.306
Would that help
balance the scales?

12:48.393 --> 12:49.894
Screw your scales.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.515
You know what?
I think it would.

12:53.732 --> 12:54.721
Come on.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.602
Take one for the team.
What, are you crazy?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.978
(GROANS)

12:58.070 --> 12:59.401
Whoo!

12:59.488 --> 13:01.774
Really needed to knock
my chakras back
into place.

13:01.865 --> 13:02.900
(COUGHS)

13:02.991 --> 13:04.492
Feeling good!

13:04.785 --> 13:06.741
(GROANS)

13:06.870 --> 13:08.280
Now, about my wife?

13:08.789 --> 13:11.496
She's smart,
she didn't let
anything slip.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.243
But I do know
something about
that tech

13:13.335 --> 13:14.825
she tried
to pay me off with.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.251
Unusual stuff.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.373
Old school.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.045
There's only one
other person in
Old Town

13:19.132 --> 13:20.383
who deals in
that kind of shit.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.799
A woman I like to call
Stinky Raincoat.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.217
What kind of name
is that?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.340
One that is ac-cur-ra-tay.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.887
You mean the crazy
conspiracy girl

13:27.975 --> 13:29.340
who's scared of water
who's always in my bar

13:29.434 --> 13:30.423
stinking it up?

13:30.519 --> 13:31.679
Mmm-hmm.

13:32.104 --> 13:34.641
Where do we find Stinky?

13:35.357 --> 13:36.346
(CHUCKLES)

13:40.070 --> 13:42.311
MAN OVER PA:
Toxins can be anywhere.

13:42.406 --> 13:45.239
Decon showers
are always nearby.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.417
Hey!

13:54.793 --> 13:55.908
Why'd you grab my ass?

13:56.003 --> 13:57.413
What? I didn't.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.290
Well, it didn't
grab itself.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.087
You're not even
my type, man.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.547
I'm everyone's type.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.378
It's a curse.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.918
You're
kind of an asshole,
you know that?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.340
Hey.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.181
Sexy people
have feelings, too.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.219
MAN OVER PA:
Keep your family safe.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.516
JOHN:
Is the warrant
on Jaq still open?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.564
D'AVlN: I wouldn't
worry about that
right now.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.609
Why, because there's
a mother-sucking
kill warrant on my wife, too?

14:22.779 --> 14:23.768
Did I mention
you're the worst?

14:23.864 --> 14:24.853
What can I say?

14:24.990 --> 14:25.979
Your family's
keeping me
in the black.

14:26.158 --> 14:27.147
Thanks.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.698
Do you even know
what she's after?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.234
If I did, do you think
I'd be here with you?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.326
Look, the only way
we're gonna
find her

14:32.414 --> 14:33.950
is ifyou open
the hells up.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.326
I feel pretty open

14:35.417 --> 14:37.453
considering you just let
someone sucker punch me.

14:38.712 --> 14:39.872
I think this is it.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.995
MAN OVER PA:
Remember, if you’re...

14:42.549 --> 14:44.210
Stinky Raincoat?

14:44.301 --> 14:45.882
This place sucks.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.506
What the hells
is that?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.095
Some kind of
high-tech bird bath?

14:55.187 --> 14:57.098
I think it's
a weather station.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.304
How do you know that?

14:58.482 --> 14:59.597
I don't know,
ljust do.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.682
Well, your guess is
as good as mine.

15:02.903 --> 15:03.938
Better.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.439
My guess is better
than yours.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.616
Turin's right,
this thing's old school.

15:12.829 --> 15:13.989
Doesn't have much range.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.072
If she's tracking
the data remotely,

15:16.333 --> 15:18.574
she's gotta be within
a 700 meter radius.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.334
It says so right here.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.125
We should set up
a search grid.

15:25.509 --> 15:26.919
Sure, we could do that.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.124
Or...

15:29.429 --> 15:30.885
We could make her
come to us.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.468
ZEPH: Not again.
I'll deal with that later.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.769
Blueprints. Pull up
the blueprints again.

15:39.981 --> 15:40.970
Do you want to drive?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.476
Maybe you'll do as good
a job as you did

15:42.818 --> 15:43.978
sewing up my wound.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.317
Right. You saw that,
did you?

15:46.404 --> 15:47.735
Yeah, it's great.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.859
What woman doesn't
want an extra pocket?

15:49.950 --> 15:51.360
Now I'll never lose my keys.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.030
And you call me
the princess.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.489
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

15:57.499 --> 15:59.080
What is it
Did you find a way in?

15:59.167 --> 16:00.703
Yes, but...

16:01.002 --> 16:03.163
I also found
a problem.
A big one.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.370
l was wrong.
About what?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.835
Changing the ecosystem
of something as large
as a moon

16:08.009 --> 16:10.091
is something you'd
normally expect to happen
on geologic time.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.798
Even terraforming,
we're talking generations

16:11.930 --> 16:13.215
before you'd reach
the tipping point

16:13.306 --> 16:14.762
where native life could
no longer exist, but...

16:15.058 --> 16:17.470
This, uh, (CHUCKLES)
Lady of yours, she has...

16:17.561 --> 16:18.550
Zeph.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.101
How long do we have?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.307
Twenty-seven days.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.642
Twenty-seven days
of breathable air left.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.278
There are
so many factories.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.205
There's no way we can
shut them all down
in time.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.708
No, but there may be
a way to slow her down.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.034
See these ones?

16:45.130 --> 16:46.961
They're receiving a different
shipment of chemicals.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.121
Drawing more power.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.752
I think each one might be
some kind ofhub.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.083
lfwe can put even
one of these hubs
out of commission,

16:52.179 --> 16:54.170
we might be able
to slow it down.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.424
Pull up the
blueprints again.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.716
lfwe can put detonators
here, here, there,
there, here,

16:59.895 --> 17:02.011
and probably right there.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.686
This does not look like
a one-woman job.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.646
Well, good thing
there's two of us.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.766
Too bad only
one of us can walk.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.612
Good point.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.404
Well, you're gonna
have to go up there
and fix my receiver.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.116
I can't be your eyes
and ears without
that connection.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.655
Okay, but I'm still gonna
need backup, Zeph.

17:19.915 --> 17:24.124
Hey. You know how you
were talking about being
able to wake people up?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.667
With a protein inhibitor?

17:25.795 --> 17:27.001
That was a theory.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.415
What if it
was reality?

17:28.506 --> 17:29.495
Because we need recruits,

17:29.591 --> 17:31.456
and I can't go around
locking everyone up

17:31.551 --> 17:34.008
in rooms with
their favorite
childhood toys.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.128
Anyway.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.383
Wish me luck.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.512
So is this what
Killjoys do?

17:45.607 --> 17:47.143
They just sit around
and eat noodles?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.148
It's called a stakeout.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.521
Think you
could do better?

17:50.612 --> 17:52.068
Well, what's worse
lookae?

17:54.157 --> 17:56.569
You know, I've seen
your wife's type before.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.317
Is this another
motivational speech?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.324
What do you think
she's gonna do when
we find her?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.246
I think she's
gonna yell at me
for closing the bar.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.290
We make serious bank
on the weekends.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.372
She's going to run.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.414
How much do you
actually know
about her?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.252
We're married,
aren't we?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.054
Has she ever shared
any childhood memories?

18:17.138 --> 18:18.344
Showed you any pictures?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.218
When you got married,
was her family there?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.805
What's her father's name?

18:27.107 --> 18:28.313
What's your point?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.269
All those questions
you want to ask her,

18:30.360 --> 18:32.521
are you sure you want
the answers to them?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.897
This is bullshit.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.441
I know Yala.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.734
I know everything
abouther

18:37.826 --> 18:39.362
I know how
she likes her Hokk.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.650
What kind of shampoo
she uses,

18:40.745 --> 18:42.451
that she likes to
brush her teeth
as soon as she wakes up.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.528
We have a son.

18:44.833 --> 18:45.868
Sweet.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.250
Her side gig
as a terrorist?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.415
She tell you
about that?

18:51.756 --> 18:55.214
If you know everything
about her, how come
you haven't found her yet?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.088
Where are you going?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.339
I think
I'm better off
without you.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.420
You're fired.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.380
You didn't hire me.
Don't care.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.048
You're still fired.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.110
D'AVlN:
I should have
found her by now.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.743
What the hells am I missing?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.818
MAN: Another drink?
Sure. Why not?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.743
Just 'cause he's the
"professional"

19:28.084 --> 19:31.247
thinks he can stick
his nose in my perfectly
happy marriage.

19:31.338 --> 19:33.795
(SlGHS)

19:33.882 --> 19:36.544
MAN OVER PA: Remember,
if your bracelet chimes,

19:36.843 --> 19:38.049
you know it’s time.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.836
Head to the nearest
decon shower immediately.

20:00.075 --> 20:01.110
Balls.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.942
I shouldn't have been thinking
of a 700-meter grid,

20:04.079 --> 20:06.240
I should have been thinking
of a 700-meter cube.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.952
Okay, come on, Johnny.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.000
It's your wife down there.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.579
You love this woman.
You know this woman.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.461
I mean, you kind of
know this woman.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.314
Zeph?

20:35.443 --> 20:38.856
Where are you at with
the protein inhibitor thingy?

20:39.197 --> 20:40.437
Working on it.

20:40.532 --> 20:41.863
DUTCH: Well, work faster.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.320
I figured out a way
to recruit some new bodies,

20:44.411 --> 20:45.867
but first we're gonna
have to wake them up.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.157
A woman who knows
what she wants.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.614
lam so into that.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.253
(BOTH GRUNTING)

21:06.099 --> 21:07.384
Hey, Ship.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.132
How long have
I been here?

21:09.227 --> 21:10.216
LUCY: I’m sorry, sir,

21:10.311 --> 21:11.721
/ didn’t realize
I was supposed to be

21:11.813 --> 21:12.848
monitoring your whereabouts.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.264
Oh, of course not.
Why would you?

21:15.358 --> 21:17.144
You'rejusta dumb ship.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.525
That alley behind me.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.443
Are there any other entrances?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.272
Ship.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.862
It would appear
your instincts
are correct, sir.

21:27.036 --> 21:29.778
It’s fenced off,
but there is another entrance.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.659
And you didn't think
to tell me that?

21:32.542 --> 21:33.998
I’m afraid it didn’t
occur to me,

21:34.461 --> 21:35.871
being a dumb ship and all.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.620
JOHN: Yal?

21:39.924 --> 21:41.004
Are you here?

21:45.180 --> 21:47.796
Oh, wow.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.507
I take that back.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.969
I really,
really do not know
this woman.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.769
Hello, soldier.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.313
l was hoping it'd be you.
What are you doing here?

22:39.526 --> 22:40.732
I could ask you
the same thing.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.233
Just, uh...

22:42.737 --> 22:44.819
Science. With a side
of ass-kicking.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.105
But you know what
I really want to do?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.944
Play tag. You're it.

22:54.249 --> 22:57.082
MAN OVER PA: Remember,
you’re never far from
a decon shower.

22:57.627 --> 23:00.619
Take a moment to locate
the showers nearest you.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.183
(GASPS)

23:27.615 --> 23:29.071
You're not gonna shoot me.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.070
What makes you so sure?

23:31.536 --> 23:32.946
I know you.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.195
You can't.

23:37.166 --> 23:38.497
Look, whoever
they told you lam,

23:38.585 --> 23:39.825
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.125
How's that
working out for you?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.869
Not great.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.541
You're a Killjoy.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.008
I'm a bartender.

23:49.262 --> 23:50.627
We don't know each other.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.879
But you feel like
we do. Why?

23:53.349 --> 23:54.600
You have
that kind of a face.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.099
Look around you.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.102
Ask yourself
why it all feels
so wrong.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.642
Is this the point
where you try
to convert me?

24:04.068 --> 24:06.059
I would if I could.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.153
But it's not that easy.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.618
I don't want
to do this alone.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.279
Your bracelet.
What's it for?

24:17.749 --> 24:20.786
When you think about
the past, how far back
can you remember?

24:20.877 --> 24:24.369
Why does it rain at
the same time
every single night?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.621
Move any closer
and lwill shoot.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.170
Ask yourself why.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.760
D'avin.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.387
Why can't you do it?

24:51.491 --> 24:52.480
(BEEPING)

25:02.210 --> 25:03.450
Who am | to you?

25:36.661 --> 25:39.118
I am enjoying
this new skin.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.788
Was there
something wrong
with that other body?

25:47.213 --> 25:48.578
You want to know
about me.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.504
I want to know about
your missing daughter.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.504
Shall we make a deal?
She's not my daughter.

25:53.594 --> 25:54.583
You think of her as one.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.138
You were inside
herhead.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.258
What can I tell you
that you don't already know?

25:59.392 --> 26:02.475
Tell me where she is!

26:03.938 --> 26:06.395
Tell me why you brought me
out of the Green.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.606
Khlyen.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.729
You're the one
in chains.

26:14.115 --> 26:17.323
And you're the one
asking me for favors.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.528
You think you can
figure this out.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.113
Don't you?

26:24.375 --> 26:26.115
llovethatconﬁdence.

26:26.711 --> 26:29.578
It's what
I find most charming
about humans.

26:29.964 --> 26:32.797
Confidence born of
generations of ignorance.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.291
Why do you want her?

26:34.677 --> 26:36.087
What is she to you?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.544
The question you should be
asking yourself

26:38.639 --> 26:41.176
is what are you to me
ifyou don't deliver?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.312
Dead, I suspect.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.971
You're not
so ignorant
after all.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.110
Zeph?

27:03.414 --> 27:04.824
Mmm!

27:04.916 --> 27:06.122
They found us.
We have to get
out of here.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.623
Who?
Your husband.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.250
I don't know how
he tracked us down,

27:09.420 --> 27:11.376
or how he knows
we're working together,
but he was here,

27:11.464 --> 27:12.704
and he was going
through my stuff,

27:12.799 --> 27:15.290
and ljust feel
very violated.

27:15.927 --> 27:17.588
Also he stole
one of my slates.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.256
Your protein inhibitor thing.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.632
Where are we at with that?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.638
lt's ready.

27:22.934 --> 27:24.265
We just need to test it.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.727
Didn't expect you back.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.025
You were right.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.020
l was?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.605
We've been married
for 16 years,

27:39.700 --> 27:41.281
and I don't even know
who my wife is.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.652
Tracked her friend's tech
to her hidey-hole,

27:44.747 --> 27:47.454
it's like a true crime vid
down there.

27:48.876 --> 27:50.707
Real terrorist shit.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.544
Makes me wonder
how crazy the both
of them are.

27:53.923 --> 27:55.459
She's not crazy.

27:57.635 --> 27:58.841
What do you mean?

27:59.011 --> 28:00.922
I don't even know
if she's a terrorist.

28:02.431 --> 28:03.420
I found her.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.140
I had her.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.055
Well, she had me.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.731
She gave me this.

28:14.569 --> 28:16.309
Blueprints for some
sort of...

28:17.029 --> 28:18.530
chemical factory.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.109
Stinky Raincoat
was tracking shipments

28:21.200 --> 28:22.315
to the same factory.

28:26.789 --> 28:27.778
It's too easy.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.416
She's gotta be
setting you up,
right?

28:31.460 --> 28:32.996
Not if we
get there first.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.123
”We”?

28:35.298 --> 28:37.664
Well, I made
a promise. Right?

28:38.551 --> 28:40.007
Let's find your wife.

28:41.220 --> 28:44.553
Oh, and also,
l'll shoot you
ifyou screw this up.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.593
Fair warning.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.925
Understood.

28:52.481 --> 28:55.439
You just have to get it
right between my vertebrae.

28:55.526 --> 28:56.515
(GRUNTS)

28:57.945 --> 28:59.025
Great.

28:59.196 --> 29:00.402
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

29:01.324 --> 29:03.064
Are you sure
you're ready
to do this?

29:03.576 --> 29:04.861
Yes.

29:04.952 --> 29:08.365
Even if this goes
wrong, it shouldn't
incapacitate me.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.071
Too much.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.913
I'm not talking about
the science.

29:15.755 --> 29:16.915
I know.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.713
Just tell me.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.508
What was I like when lwas me?

29:23.846 --> 29:25.211
Was I happy?

29:26.349 --> 29:28.010
Did you like me?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.267
Everyone did.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.398
But some of your
real memories, Zeph...

29:38.569 --> 29:39.649
(SIGHS)

29:39.987 --> 29:40.976
...are gonna hurt.

29:43.366 --> 29:46.153
You lost people
because of me.

29:48.537 --> 29:49.663
It's okay.

29:51.582 --> 29:55.120
I need to know the good,
and the bad.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.792
You ready?
No.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.085
Yes. Whatever.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.165
Just”

30:03.386 --> 30:04.796
When I say go,

30:05.096 --> 30:06.461
hit that button.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.257
Okay, go.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.135
(MACHINE REVS)

30:22.154 --> 30:23.439

30:29.328 --> 30:30.989
(SOFTLY) Pippin...

30:33.416 --> 30:35.327
(TEARFULLY)
I don't want to miss him
all over again.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.328
I know, I'm sorry, Zeph.
I'm sorry.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.830
It's all my fault.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.003
It's all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.835
I'm sorry.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.136
No, it's not.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.047
It's hers.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.517
What do you need?

30:56.731 --> 30:58.562
To make this bitch pay.

31:07.158 --> 31:09.820
MAN OVER PA:
A shower a day
keeps the toxins away.

31:10.161 --> 31:14.279
All workers must be
decontaminated before
and after shifts.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.322
Halt.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.249
Come on, get out.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.244
I'm a Level Six Killjoy,

31:21.380 --> 31:22.836
I have a warrant to bring in
a known terrorist.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.424
Yeah, yeah, look,
you're still gonna
need clearance.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.294
Hi.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.511
Well, shit.

31:32.141 --> 31:33.301
I'm not gonna hurt you.

31:33.684 --> 31:34.844
But I need you
to come with me.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.471
lwill, I promise.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.553
But not yet.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.904
Hi.

31:45.988 --> 31:48.479
Don't know if anyone noticed,
but I'm standing right here.

31:48.824 --> 31:49.984
What are
you doing, Yala?

31:50.076 --> 31:51.486
I'm saying goodbye
to my husband.

31:51.786 --> 31:52.992
I'm done playing.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.788
I just want
my wife back.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.409
I can't give you that.
I'm sorry.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.324
But I promise you,

32:00.711 --> 32:01.700
in abouta minute,

32:03.047 --> 32:04.583
none of this will matter.

32:12.306 --> 32:13.671
All right, Zeph.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.389
Light 'em up.

32:15.643 --> 32:16.974
Cuing up charge now.

32:17.770 --> 32:20.136

you have to get out
of there, Dutch.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.519
It will work, Zeph.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.111
ldon’t have a lot
of faith in people,

32:26.278 --> 32:27.358
but I have faith in you.

32:41.544 --> 32:42.533
Dutch?

32:45.172 --> 32:47.128
Isthatyou?

32:52.638 --> 32:52.672
We've gotta move.

32:52.680 --> 32:53.886
We've gotta move.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.848
I got a really
bad taste in my mouth.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.467
What is that, cheese?

33:00.604 --> 33:02.219
Jaq. Where's Jaq?
We found him.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.303
With Delle Seyah,
he's okay.

33:03.649 --> 33:04.934
What about Aneela?

33:06.360 --> 33:07.395
But I remember, we...

33:07.820 --> 33:08.809
We destroyed the Green.

33:08.988 --> 33:09.977
We still lost.

33:10.072 --> 33:11.903
The Lady got out,
and we're running
out of time.

33:12.074 --> 33:13.234
Look, I'll explain
everything later,

33:13.325 --> 33:15.816
but right now, we're in
one of her terraforming
factories.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.698
I'm sorry, did you say
terraforming?

33:18.122 --> 33:21.239
Johnny, I need you
to plug Zeph into
the security system.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.582
Once she's in,
she can link up
our com implants,

33:23.669 --> 33:25.409
and then,
she can keep an eye
out for bogies

33:25.504 --> 33:27.961
while we place charges
and blow the shit
out of this place.

33:28.132 --> 33:29.121
Cool.

33:29.258 --> 33:30.418
You used to work here.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.295
Do you remember
where the mainframe is?

33:35.181 --> 33:37.172
Yeah. It's that way.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.215
Okay.

33:57.995 --> 34:00.111
Not to get
super emo here,

34:00.206 --> 34:02.993
but were you guys, like,
married, married?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.533
What happens between a man
and his wife is none
of your business.

34:05.753 --> 34:07.414
Well, if his wife
is my girlfriend...

34:07.713 --> 34:09.169
Am I your girlfriend?

34:09.256 --> 34:10.291
Well, are you...

34:10.507 --> 34:11.713
Not my girlfriend?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.711
Itjust sounds so young.

34:13.969 --> 34:17.712
And I've, you know,
killed people with forks.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.171
Well, this is awkward.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.255
Have you guys
not had the talk?

34:20.351 --> 34:21.932
No. Because we're adults.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.050
Oh, adults, really?

34:23.145 --> 34:25.101
Because you're the one
that kept hitting on
my fake wife, hoss.

34:25.231 --> 34:27.517
While under
the influence of an evil
extraterrestrial being.

34:27.816 --> 34:29.317
Just saying
it shows poor
character.

Look, we've got
about 17 minutes

34:31.111 --> 34:32.647
until the next

34:32.738 --> 34:34.274
Move now, bitch later.

with conflicts.

always shower first

34:48.128 --> 34:49.459

You should have access

34:49.546 --> 34:51.161
to the security system
any minute now.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.173
I'm in.
Linking up coms now.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.591
Welcome back, boys.

34:55.678 --> 34:57.168
Let's get this over with
so I can take a shower.

34:57.513 --> 34:58.798
Okay, boys.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.504
Holster your inner bros.
It's go time.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.381
ZEPH: You’ve got a bogey
approaching from the north.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.475
Darn it.
Is that Pree?

35:09.566 --> 35:11.022
How did he track us?

35:11.110 --> 35:12.099
Okay, let's split up.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.609
You go ahead.
We'll take care of Pree.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.315
Fine. Take these
detonators.

35:16.657 --> 35:18.739
Try not to
kill each other
while I'm gone.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.118
MAN OVER PA:
Five minutes to shift change.

35:23.872 --> 35:25.908
ZEPH: You know, this place
doesn’t look like
I thought it would.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.581
What, compared
to all the other

35:27.668 --> 35:29.408
alien terraforming factories
you've seen?

35:30.254 --> 35:31.243
Valid point.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.794
A little bitchy,
butvaHd.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.421
Left or right?

35:35.509 --> 35:37.170
ZEPH:
Left and left again.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.137
You’ve got another bogey
up ahead.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.731
You following me?

35:50.274 --> 35:51.480
Great minds
think alike.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.307
Thought we were
on the same side.

35:53.402 --> 35:55.017
Oh, we are, cheekbones.

35:55.779 --> 35:57.940
Only I know when I'm being
led down the garden path.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.188
We work together,

35:59.450 --> 36:00.815
I could help you move up.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.816
Put in a good word
with Interstellar.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.322
Sure.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.411
That offer come
with a lap dance?

36:07.249 --> 36:08.489
(SIGHS)

36:09.501 --> 36:11.162
She was
my target first.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.293
Yeah. Then you lost her.

36:15.257 --> 36:16.588
Stop moving.

36:17.092 --> 36:19.424
I don't want
a pile of paperwork
on my desk tomorrow.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.591
JOHN: Hey, numb nuts.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.668
Son ofa...

36:25.726 --> 36:26.715
Took you long enough.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.718
Hey, I'm not the one
who was supposed to
get him into position.

36:29.813 --> 36:30.893
Wanna help me carry him?

36:31.315 --> 36:32.430
You're the older brother.

36:32.649 --> 36:33.934
I think you mean bigger.

36:34.026 --> 36:36.312
Mmm. Size is relative.

36:36.403 --> 36:37.609
Just gonna
leave that one hanging.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.811
Hey, Dutch.

36:38.906 --> 36:39.895
Where you at?

36:40.908 --> 36:42.364
Hey, who are you?
(COCKS GUN)

36:42.701 --> 36:44.282
Give me a second, boys.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.527
Just dealing with
a little distraction.

36:46.622 --> 36:48.283
Heads up.

36:48.374 --> 36:49.784
(BEEPS)
Don't move a muscle.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.666
Inside that bomb
is a gyroscopic trigger.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.745
Any movements,
ifyou so much
as breathe,

36:55.839 --> 36:57.124
or even blink...

36:58.258 --> 36:59.998
they'll be cleaning you
off the ceiling.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.258
Have a nice day.

37:07.059 --> 37:08.174
Zeph?

37:08.394 --> 37:09.554
Are you seeing this?

37:09.812 --> 37:11.222
I see it.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.559
What is it?

37:22.366 --> 37:23.947
(CREATURE SQUIRMING)

37:24.618 --> 37:26.825
And what the hells is that?

37:29.081 --> 37:30.491
So these things...

37:30.707 --> 37:32.698
Do you think
they're her children?

37:32.793 --> 37:34.374
ZEPH: Her species, at least.

37:34.670 --> 37:37.412
Then there's
gotta be a reason she's
terraforming Westerley.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.622
Maybe these things are it.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.790
She’s making them a home?

37:42.219 --> 37:45.052
If you're gonna terraform
a whole moon, I guess
you want company.

37:45.681 --> 37:47.512
Creepy, creepy company.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.218
Excuse me?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.639
Could you possibly tell me
where the washroom is?

37:57.484 --> 37:59.065
(MAN GRUNTING)

38:01.530 --> 38:02.736
D'AVlN: Are you okay?

38:03.115 --> 38:04.355
I'm fine.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.532
Look, Zeph, if The Lady
is using Westerley

38:06.618 --> 38:08.358
as a little cozy nest
for these things,

38:08.454 --> 38:09.694
then what are we
in the equation?

38:10.622 --> 38:11.611
Lots of possibilities.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.447
Workers, maybe research...

38:13.542 --> 38:14.531
Food?

38:14.626 --> 38:15.877
Could be, yeah.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.293
Well, that's a picnic
I don't want to sit at.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.790
Look, we can’t be sure
these explosions

38:19.882 --> 38:21.622
are gonna take care
of these things,

38:21.717 --> 38:25.426
so John, D'av, finish
laying the charges
to secure our exit.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.093
While I'll deal with our...

38:27.181 --> 38:28.261
Dinner dates?

38:28.348 --> 38:29.383
D'AVlN: Not funny, John.

38:29.933 --> 38:32.515
ZEPH: Better hurry up,
it’s about six minutes
to your next patrol.

38:32.853 --> 38:35.811
Thanks for all your help
with Snoozy Sparkles here.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.391
Well, it's my pleasure.

38:37.566 --> 38:38.555
Hey, shitbird.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.106
Remember the part where
you broke into my ship

38:40.194 --> 38:41.183
and tried to shoot me?

38:41.320 --> 38:42.309
Didn't remember that
you were my brother,

38:42.404 --> 38:43.393
it doesn't count.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.653
I miss fake Johnny.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.485
I missed you, too,
asshole.

Dutch, was that you?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.746
Might have been, yeah.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.330
What?

39:41.421 --> 39:43.628
Whoa, guys,
are you there?

Guys!

39:45.634 --> 39:46.623
Hey,Zeph?

39:46.885 --> 39:48.500
Could we get a little help
with the door down here?

Dutch, get your ass
down here now.

Shit on toast.

Okay. I'm gonna have
to go outside.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.687
Took you long enough!

40:08.073 --> 40:10.029
Did you find a workaround
to open the door?

40:10.576 --> 40:12.942
Not before a shitload
of muscle comes down
on our asses.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.910
Zeph, are you there?

40:17.666 --> 40:18.655

I know.

Take him to the
transfusion chamber.

She won't break for me,
but she will for you.

41:53.804 --> 41:55.135
She'll know
it's not me.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.554
You'll lose her.
And you'll never find Jaq.

you're after,
isn't it?

with their memories.

where he is.

a bargain, Khlyen?

Yes.

Then choose carefully,
because you can only
save one.

or your grandson.
