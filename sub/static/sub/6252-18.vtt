I can’t believe you forgot
your binoculars.

00:08.301 --> 00:11.259
A Iepidopterist without binoculars
is like a day without sunshine.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.176
Guess I was nervous
to meet you.

00:13.264 --> 00:16.176
I’ve never done
the “online date” thing before.

00:16.267 --> 00:18.633
[ Man ] There’s
a Red-banded Hairstreak.
It’s so beautiful.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.844
Look what’s next to it.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.642
Right.
Another butterfly.

00:23.733 --> 00:26.065
- Hackberry Emperor.
- Of course.

00:26.152 --> 00:29.064
- Guess I’m just tired.
- You’ve only been at it for a few hours.

00:29.155 --> 00:31.988
When you e-mailed me
and said you were into butterflies,

00:32.074 --> 00:35.612
it sounded romantic,
not like school.

00:37.079 --> 00:40.321
- You’re not really
a lepidopterist, are you?
- No, Gary.

00:40.416 --> 00:43.078
I’m just a woman
looking for a man.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.043
Oh.
Yeah.

00:46.130 --> 00:48.997
- And I brought a blanket.
- Fantastic!

00:49.091 --> 00:52.925
Look at these.
Oh, look at these.

00:53.054 --> 00:56.137
A swarm
of Silvery Checkerspots.
Oh, my God.

00:57.308 --> 01:00.471
This is romantic.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.894
But you’re gonna remember this
a lot more than those butterflies, Gary.

01:03.981 --> 01:07.394
[ Chuckles, Grunts]
Yeah.

01:07.485 --> 01:10.443
- They don’t usually swarm like this.
- Neither do |.

[ Brennan ]
Partially skeletonized.
Ribs splayed open.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.710
l have a feeling
this wasn’t natural causes.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.837
Animal or psycho?
Probably.

01:37.932 --> 01:40.639
The angle of the mandible
and the brow of the skull...

01:40.726 --> 01:43.638
indicate a male
around 40 to 50,

01:43.729 --> 01:46.471
judging by the wear
on the mandibular teeth.

01:46.607 --> 01:50.270
Hey, what’s— what’s with
all the butterflies?
Chlosyne nycz‘e/s.

01:50.361 --> 01:53.774
They’re the Silvery Checkerspot,
indigenous to the area.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.397
They’re probably just
attracted by the remains.
Whoa, whoa, wait.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.741
Butterflies eat
dead people?
Yeah.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.534
Hey, they may look beautiful,

02:00.621 --> 02:03.454
but they’ll eat bird excrement
and aphid guts,

02:03.541 --> 02:05.497

02:05.584 --> 02:07.085
Oh. Right.

- What the hell?
- [ Sniffs]

02:10.214 --> 02:12.250
Something smells

02:15.594 --> 02:17.585
- [ Sniffing ]
- I hate when you do that.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.140
It’s not a typical odor
associated with decomposition.
[ Sniffs ]

[ Bleating ]
Who would leave
a goat out here?

02:24.061 --> 02:26.393
Who cares about a goat, okay?
We’re dealing with a dead body here.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.142
- Look, shouldn’t there be more blood?
- Yes.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.565
It appears all of the blood has been
drained from the victim’s body.

- Bite marks.
- Cannibal?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.399
No. l-lt’s not
human dentition.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.702

[ Bleating Continues]

02:48.419 --> 02:50.501
So the heart is gone?

02:50.588 --> 02:53.204
Well, it’s like someone ate it
right out of his chest.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.584
[ Hodgins ]
Wow.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.588
The victim’s right ankle has
a vertical transarticular pin...

02:58.679 --> 03:01.762
that was surgically implanted
to fix a past fracture.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.090
Could be
a helpful identifier.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.925
Very good,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.763
While I have your attention
and affection, there’s something
that I’d like to say.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.265
Can you speak while working?
Of course.

03:12.360 --> 03:16.399
As you may be aware,
I am currently participating
in Alcoholics Anonymous,

- Whoa.
- I had no idea you were in AA.

03:23.954 --> 03:28.118
Yes, well, as with
everything else, discretion
has been my watchword...

except when l was vomiting
into someone’s hat.

03:30.878 --> 03:35.747
- [ Groans ]
- These look like spiny bristles
from some kind of animal.

03:35.841 --> 03:41.256
Oh, and the evidence on the X-rays
shows bone damage on the ribs...

03:41.347 --> 03:43.463
from long, fang-like teeth.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.639
Oh. Maybe the heart
was eaten.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.968
But anyway, um, I’m currently
at step nine of 12,

03:49.105 --> 03:53.644
which consists of me making
amends to those people that I’ve
harmed while I’ve been drinking.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.066
Not necessary.
Don’t even remember being wronged.

I apologize.

No.

04:09.041 --> 04:11.828
All I wanna hear from you right now
are facts about this case.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.085
Okay. At this point,
from all of the evidence...

04:15.172 --> 04:16.912
that I’ve gathered
from the X-rays...

04:17.007 --> 04:19.259
as well as the observable
evidence on the remains—

04:19.343 --> 04:23.928
indicates that our victim
was killed by a cryptid.

04:24.014 --> 04:28.758
- Cryptid?
- A creature yet unrecognized
by scientific consensus.

04:28.853 --> 04:30.389
Of course!

04:30.479 --> 04:33.221
Oh, no. You guys
aren’t gonna start talking
about werewolves, are you?

04:33.315 --> 04:36.773
Oh, no, no, no.
I would posit that
it was a chupacabra.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.274
- [ Hodgins ] Oh!
- A spiny creature the size of a bear.

04:40.364 --> 04:45.358
Vicious, forked tongued,
with fangs easily capable of
biting out the victim’s heart.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.955
But no one has ever captured
or verified this chupacabra.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.829
No, but reports show that it
sucks out its victim’s blood...

04:54.920 --> 04:57.536
and leaves behind
the scent of sulfur.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.748
And you found a goat
tethered to a stake there.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.754
Chupacabra means
“goat-sucker.”

05:02.845 --> 05:07.179
So, for cause of death,
you want me to put down
“goat-sucker”?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.547
Oh! What is that?

05:49.642 --> 05:51.803
The murder victim’s
stomach contents.

05:51.894 --> 05:55.011
Wow. If you’re hungry, there’s
uneaten food in the kitchen.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.686
You’re right. I’m sorry.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.686
There’s just something
about a pregnant woman
that precludes twisted humor.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.438
What’s up?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.441
So, I looked at the clothes
that our guy was wearing.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.739
Apparently, he did not
scrimp on the duds.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.361
Everything was brand-new.

06:08.452 --> 06:10.192
It was like
he was wearing a costume.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.575
So, maybe he wasn’t really
an outdoorsman at all.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.955
Oh, and guess what.
Vincent just apologized to me.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.331
Oh, step number nine—
making amends.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.256
Yeah. He apologized for using
my letter opener to clean
his fingernails.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.798
Ugh!
And for telling his entire darts
team that he slept with me.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.755
Oh, my God!
What is with him?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.428
He was drunk.
Well, but still.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.851
It’s not like I’m gonna
run into his darts team.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.179
Well, you are
a better person than I am.

06:38.274 --> 06:41.812
Really? I’m not gonna forget
that you told me that.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.235
[ Brennan ]
You identified the victim how?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.735
Well, no real hunter
goes out to the woods
in brand-new clothes, right?

06:48.826 --> 06:50.487
So he had to be a tourist,

06:50.578 --> 06:53.866
so I sent his description
to the hotels and lodges
in the area, and I got a hit.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.410
Pine Tree Manor.
Yeah.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.207
They said they had a guest
by the name of Lee Coleman,

06:59.295 --> 07:01.661
who disappeared
and left his stuff behind.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.129
Lee Coleman.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.881
The Lee Coleman.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.839
Why do you keep saying his name
as if! should know him?

07:12.933 --> 07:14.764
Lee Coleman.
K/Y/ the Myth.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.843
It’s a TV show
on the Wilderness Network.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.061
I’ve never seen it.
Wow. Do you even own a TV?

07:19.148 --> 07:21.355
Of course.
It’s in the closet.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.933
Naturally. Anyway, on the show,
Coleman would go out...

07:24.028 --> 07:26.895
and he would debunk
different myths and legends.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.196

the yeti,

07:29.283 --> 07:31.069

I’m not familiar
with the yada-yada—yada myth,

07:33.495 --> 07:36.623
but the rest of them don’t need
disproving because they don’t exist.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.914
Okay, again, just because
you haven’t seen something,

07:39.001 --> 07:40.787
it doesn’t mean
that it doesn’t exist.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.585
I mean, you haven’t seen
the back side of the moon,
but you believe in it.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.751
[ Laughing ]
What?

07:46.842 --> 07:51.256

of an amusing quip about
the back side of your moon.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.674
[ Laughing ]
All right. Great.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.516
What if Coleman was in the woods
trying to disprove the chupacabra
for K/// the Myth?

07:57.645 --> 07:59.977
And the myth
killed him instead.
It could happen.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.851
No, it couldn’t. You can’t be killed
by something that doesn’t exist.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.354
- You can, if it does exist.
- I don’t think you understand
what the word “myth” means.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.374
if you mooned a mirror.
[Laughs]

08:19.458 --> 08:22.621

Get it?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.833
It’s pretty clever, right?
It’s clever, yeah. Clever.

08:26.924 --> 08:30.041
Yeah, I’d laugh, but, uh, I’m
afraid of driving off the road.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.088

10:03.645 --> 10:05.852
Tums out they are skin,
but not human.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.807
Now, judging by the heavily
keratinized stratum corneum,
they appear to be reptilian.

in West Virginia.

I can’t believe he’s gone.

You were his producer.
You must’ve known
he was goin’ out there.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.972
I rarely knew
what Lee was up to.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.890
He insisted on doing
all of his own research.

11:25.978 --> 11:30.062
Can you think of anyone
who would want to harm Lee?

11:30.148 --> 11:32.480
He made a career
out of making people
look like fools.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.274
Everyone he debunked
probably wanted him dead.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.979
Believers in superstitions like these—
they turn to illogical explanations...

11:38.073 --> 11:41.315
as a way of deriving control
in a frightening and uncertain world.

11:41.410 --> 11:44.743
- They’re nuts.
- That’s a more succinct way
of putting it.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.322
But when a person like that
has his way of life challenged,

11:48.417 --> 11:50.408
becoming violent
would not be surprising.

11:50.502 --> 11:54.211
- You know, Lee was
attacked once... by a dog.
- He debunked a dog?

11:54.298 --> 11:57.665
- What— What was it pretending to be?
- He debunked a pet psychic.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.541
Oh.
She lost a lot of clients.

11:59.636 --> 12:04.005
Um, one day Lee
was coming out of the studio,
and this dog just went for him,

12:04.099 --> 12:06.841
and the pet psychic
was just across the street
watching the whole thing.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.597
- Was it her dog?
- She denied it, but why else
would she be there?

12:09.688 --> 12:11.679
That mutt latched on
to Lee’s leg.

12:11.773 --> 12:14.810
He fell. He broke his ankle,
had to have surgery.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.143
And we couldn’t
even touch the psychic.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.191
- When was this?
- Last year.

12:20.282 --> 12:23.649
- Oh.
- But he insisted on rerunning
the episode two weeks ago.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.285
- He disappeared right after that.
- Yeah.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.704
I told him
he should forget about her.
She’s a loon.

12:29.791 --> 12:32.658
But he wanted
to go after her again.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.965
I’ve never seen bone damage
like this before.

12:40.052 --> 12:43.886
Normally, puncture marks
resulting from carnivorous
scavenging...

12:43.972 --> 12:46.839
are accompanied by pits
in the cortical bone surfaces.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.845
Which are not in evidence.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.847
Mysteriously.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.681
So I’ll analyze the wounds
and try and establish which
were caused by small animals...

12:54.775 --> 12:57.608
and which might’ve been
caused by the chupacabra.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.027
You are not letting
this chupacabra thing go, are ya?

13:01.114 --> 13:04.026
I’d be skeptical if you told me
that there was a venomous,

13:04.117 --> 13:08.030
egg-laying, duck-billed,
beaver-tailed mammal,

13:08.121 --> 13:10.737
and yet the platypus—

13:10.832 --> 13:12.959
it does exist.
[ Sniffing ]

13:13.043 --> 13:17.082
Uh, Mr. Nigel-Murray,
do you need me to take
that alcohol away from you?

13:17.881 --> 13:19.462
Oh! No.
[Chuckles]

13:19.549 --> 13:22.882
No, don’t be absurd.
This is, uh, 80% ethyl alcohol.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.552
I would most likely go blind
if I were to drink this.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.051
lt— Yeah, yeah.
Take it away from me.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.219
Yeah.
Take the top.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.014
Dr. Saroyan.
Sorry.

13:34.106 --> 13:39.021
I really need you to let me
apologize to you,
for my sobriety.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.521
Fine. Shoot.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.652
[ Chuckles ]
Thank you.
[Clears Throat]

13:46.743 --> 13:49.325
I once went into your office,
uh, when you weren’t there,

13:49.413 --> 13:52.200
and I noticed
that your desk drawer
was open,

13:52.290 --> 13:55.748
and I saw a stack
of grocery coupons
from the Sunday paper.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.827
Okay. Continue.

13:57.921 --> 13:59.957
And I took
some of the coupons.
[ Clears Throat]

14:00.048 --> 14:03.961
I took— One was for a soda,
and I took another one
for a cheese snack.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.384
And a third was for
a frozen fish dinner.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.467
Three coupons?
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]

14:09.558 --> 14:12.265
I was tipsy.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.685
I understand.
And as long as that’s it,
I forgive you.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.728
Um—

14:18.942 --> 14:21.900
What?
I also told some mates
from Paleontology...

14:21.987 --> 14:24.694
that you and I— that
we enjoyed a passionate...

14:24.781 --> 14:28.319
and extremely gymnastic
sexual relationship.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.818
What?
Yes, I did. It’s all true.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.823
I can’t believe
you did that.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.656
l-l know. I know.
And I am deeply,
deeply sorry.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.412
But it was the hooch.

14:38.795 --> 14:42.629
Uh— Oh, forget it.

14:42.716 --> 14:46.925
The injuries on the bones,
I would like an explanation
for them as soon as possible—

14:47.012 --> 14:49.970
one that will not be met
with derision.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.595
I shouldn’t have told her
about the coupons.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.269
I think the victim
is providing
a valuable service...

14:58.398 --> 15:00.775
by debunking
these myths.
Hmm.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.267
[Men Shouting]
Take a look at this.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.649
- This is your proof
- [Shouting in Spanish]

15:06.740 --> 15:08.401
Oh, no.
Don’t be angry at me.

15:08.492 --> 15:11.575
Your priest is the one
who has tricked you. Look.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.368
- / put up a hidden camera—
- [Man]...the deI/i/l

15:14.456 --> 15:17.118
and this is what
it recorded last n/ght.

15:17.209 --> 15:20.292
Your priest has rigged
this statue to cry.

15:20.420 --> 15:25.505
You know, some of these segments
that Coleman recorded
used hidden cameras.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.378
He wouldn’t need
a camera crew.

15:27.469 --> 15:30.302
For his expose on the chupacabra,
he might’ve put up cameras.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.295
They could still be there.
Exactly.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.971
I should watch the show.
You know, not all miracles
are fake, Bones.

15:37.062 --> 15:41.146
Mm-mmm. There’s
a reasonable explanation
for all phenomena.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.394
You know, I saw a yeti.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.022
[Laughs]
Don’t be ridiculous.
Yetis don’t exist.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.603
I was in Nepal.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.110
Rangers have a secure
training base there.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.318
l was doing field exercises,
about to rendezvous
with my platoon,

15:54.412 --> 15:57.199
and... I saw it...

15:57.290 --> 15:59.872
about 30, 35 feet in front of me.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.121
You were in the snow,

16:02.212 --> 16:04.794
in unfamiliar terrain,
alone.

16:04.923 --> 16:07.881
Hallucinations
are common.
It was over 10 feet tall.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.710
It was huge.
I looked straight in its eyes.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.336
I pointed my rifle at it,
and it ran.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.338
This was no hallucination.
Booth.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.924
- I’m sure you thought—
- Okay, why don’t you
just trust me here?

16:18.019 --> 16:21.682
Why can’t you just use
that brilliant scientific mind of yours...

16:21.773 --> 16:24.856
and at least admit
that the possibility...

16:24.943 --> 16:26.899
of what I’m saying here is true?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.320
- You— You’re serious?
- Just forget it.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.570
You know, you talk
a really good game, Bones,
but when it comes down to it,

16:33.660 --> 16:37.653
you’re no different than people
who were certain that the sun
revolved around the Earth.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.999
- That’s not true.
- Hmm.

16:48.633 --> 16:51.295
Well, I did some readings
for Nancy Reagan.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.753
Her dog— a Cavalier
King Charles spaniel, Rex—

16:54.848 --> 16:56.338
cute little thing.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.846
He had some issues with
being in the public eye.
[Laughs]

16:59.978 --> 17:02.594
You can understand.
Sure, sure.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.021
Well, Hobart likes you.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.895
Thinks you have a kind
and understanding face.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.476
- Hobart?
- Hobart.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.857
Hello!
Oh.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.403
Hello.
Hobart looks like
a very nice bird as well.

17:15.535 --> 17:20.199
I wanted to ask you about—
Lee Coleman. I know.
Horrible man.

17:20.290 --> 17:24.124
He has no idea how many animals
he hurt by spreading
those lies about me.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.248
- You were angry about that.
- Well, we all were!

17:27.339 --> 17:31.503
Uh-huh. Well, he thought
you were responsible
for the dog attacking him.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.834
[Laughs]
That’s nonsense.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.053
Hadley acted on his own.
Of course.

17:37.140 --> 17:41.053
But you were with Hadley
when he attacked. I mean,
you could’ve restrained him.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.932
- Well, we were taking a walk.
It all happened very fast.
- Hello!

17:45.023 --> 17:48.060
And he does regret
the pain that he caused.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.359
- He told you that?
- We communicated, yes.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.687
Two weeks ago,
when Lee Coleman was killed,

17:53.782 --> 17:56.148
you were also in West Virginia,
weren’t you?

17:56.243 --> 17:58.905
Yes, I was seeing
a client— a horse.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.453
He felt emotionally displaced
because his owners got a pony.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.371
Well, the farmer
who hired you...

18:04.459 --> 18:06.495
said that you came and went
on your own schedule.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.256
- What are you implying?
- You’re the psychic, Miss Michaels.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.298
I’m sure you can figure it out.
Your business was hurt.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.343
You felt humiliated
and ridiculed.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.010
You wanted revenge.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.556
I did not kill
that dreadful man.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.258
I was at the farm.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.937
Ask the horse, or the chickens.
They all saw me.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.604
Right.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.684
I am not crazy, Dr. Sweets,
and I do want to help.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.817
I heard that you found a goat
at the murder scene.

18:35.949 --> 18:39.237
If you want me
to talk to him.
Nah!

18:39.327 --> 18:41.488
No, thank you,
but thank you.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.363
[Hoban]
Good-bye.
Um, this is getting weird.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.665
So, if Coleman used
a hidden camera out here,

18:47.752 --> 18:50.289
he probably would’ve
had it aimed where
the goat was tethered.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.462
You really had to
volunteer us for this, huh?

18:52.549 --> 18:55.461
Yeah! Thought comin’ out
to the woods would be nice,
you know?

18:55.593 --> 18:58.209
A little fresh air.
Honey, let me share
something with you.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.011
There’s a human
growing inside me.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.885
Vegging on the couch and eating
pints of mint chip ice cream...

19:02.976 --> 19:05.012
is all I actually want to do.

19:05.145 --> 19:09.104
Recent studies show that mothers
who gain excess weight
during pregnancy...

19:09.190 --> 19:11.977
make their babies more prone
to childhood obesity.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.979
Huh. That’s interesting.

19:14.070 --> 19:18.279
I read a study that says
that husbands who suggest
their pregnant wives are fat...

19:18.366 --> 19:21.108
are far more prone
to being slugged by them.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.614
Right. Okay then.

19:23.705 --> 19:26.037
Uh, cameras. Cameras.
Yes.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.116
So I watched the segments
of Kill the Myth that Brennan sent.

19:29.252 --> 19:32.744
Uh-huh.
Coleman always seems to use
the same type of camera.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.423
It’s a fixed-lens infrared
surveillance camera...

19:36.509 --> 19:38.921
with a maximum focal length
of 20 feet.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.424
So then we should
just measure...

19:41.514 --> 19:44.347
a 20-foot perimeter
from the stake...

19:44.434 --> 19:46.015
and then start
searching.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.556
You know what
I don’t understand?
What’s that, babe?

19:48.688 --> 19:53.307
How come a creature
whose name means “goat-sucker”
didn’t suck the goat?

19:53.401 --> 19:57.235
[ Scoffs ]
Because there’s no such
thing as a chupacabra.

19:57.322 --> 20:00.280
Oh, this coming from the woman that
believes the stars control our fates.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.359
Of course you’re going
to belittle astrology.
You’re a Virgo.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.785
I think I got something.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.993
Well, h-how are we
gonna get up there?

20:10.085 --> 20:11.916
Well, it’s just
a little tree.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.335
Hey, babe, you’re going
to be a father.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.413
I don’t want anything
to happen to you.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.920
Okay. But please—
Please be careful.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.297
Okay.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.304
- Got it.
- Hold on tight.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.508
All right.
I’m gonna throw this
down to you, okay?

20:27.602 --> 20:29.103
Yeah.

20:31.481 --> 20:34.393
Got it. Um, it looks like
there’s some water damage,

20:34.484 --> 20:37.726
but I might be able to recover
some data from the memory card.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.527
Uh-huh.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.570
If this time stamp is correct,

20:41.658 --> 20:44.274
this was taken on the night
that Lee Coleman was killed.

20:45.787 --> 20:48.153
He might have recorded
his own murder.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.247
This is the original image...

20:59.342 --> 21:02.459
of the damage done
to the victim’s ribs and torso.

21:02.554 --> 21:07.344
Now here I’ve eliminated
all injuries caused from
postmortem scavenging,

21:07.434 --> 21:10.676
leaving only the wounds
incurred during
the initial attack.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.219
What is this triangle?

21:13.314 --> 21:14.929
That is a bite mark,

21:15.024 --> 21:19.984
presumably the result
of two upper incisors
and a single lower incisor.

21:20.071 --> 21:23.529
I’m not familiar with any animal
with that configuration of teeth.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.698
Like that.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.782
Legend says that that
is how the goat-sucker...

21:29.873 --> 21:31.534
drains blood from its prey.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.741
Hodgins is analyzing the swab
from the injury site.

21:34.836 --> 21:37.748
We’ll see what he comes up with
that doesn’t rely on legend.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.205
I— I’m very, very sorry.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.586
Why? You’ve done more
than satisfactory work.

21:42.677 --> 21:44.292
Oh! No, no, no, no.

21:44.387 --> 21:48.676
As part of my recovery,
uh, for drinking a lot
and having fun,

21:48.766 --> 21:50.427
I have to make amends.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.895
All right. What for?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.516
One night,
I borrowed your iguana...

21:55.607 --> 21:59.225
and wore it as a hat
at a party.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.062
Well, you must’ve taken care of him,
because I didn’t see any damage.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.443
And also I have
to apologize, um,

22:06.534 --> 22:09.321
for spreading a rumor—
[ Chuckles ]

22:09.412 --> 22:11.744
that you and l were lovers.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.039
But it was nothing serious.
We were on and off.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.868
We were just each other’s
sexual playthings.

22:17.962 --> 22:21.921
And please remember

33:25.838 --> 33:28.170
There’s something
that I need to show you,
Dr. Saroyan.

33:28.257 --> 33:32.421
- No confessions?
- I confess, no.

33:34.805 --> 33:38.138
l sorted through
the dentition of dozens
of carnivorous animals,

33:38.225 --> 33:41.843
and I finally found a match
to the puncture wounds
on the victim’s ribs.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.930
They are consistent with
the bite of a black bear.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.772
A black bear?
Yes.

33:47.860 --> 33:50.351
And also,
when I looked back
at the X-rays,

33:55.326 --> 33:58.113
totally even,
and that’s odd.

33:58.204 --> 34:02.117
I also found evidence
of abrasions on the tissue
left on the ankles.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.494
And look at this.
[ Beeping ]

34:04.585 --> 34:09.045
The cervical and lumbar vertebrae
appear to be separated.

34:09.173 --> 34:12.757
This is all consistent
with him being hung upside down
by his ankles.

34:12.843 --> 34:15.220
- Which would explain
the abrasions.
- Of course.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.886
His blood wasn’t sucked out
by some mythical creature.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.133
It was drained—
[ Sighs ]

34:19.225 --> 34:20.681
using the same method
employed by hunters.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.305
Remember that chemical compound
I found in the bite mark?

34:23.395 --> 34:26.478
Bisphenol A,
diethyl propane
and amorphous silica.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.351
Dude, this isn’t Jeopardy].

34:28.442 --> 34:31.809
I finally figured out
what contained
those three chemicals.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.111
Jaw Jelly.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.149
Jaw Jelly is
a one-partjell adhesive...

34:38.244 --> 34:43.159
used by taxidermists to
create a wet look in the mouths
of animals they’ve mounted.

34:43.249 --> 34:44.739
Are you thinking
of taking up taxidermy?

34:44.833 --> 34:46.619
No. This is relevant
to the case.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.417
I believe the bite marks
to Coleman’s ribs...

34:49.505 --> 34:52.121
came from a taxidermy bear.

34:52.216 --> 34:54.423
Right. So he was killed
by a stuffed animal?

34:54.510 --> 34:58.298
Whoever simulated this attack
used a bear tooth...

34:58.389 --> 35:02.382
to imitate
the tripartite incisor pattern
ascribed to a chupacabra.

35:02.476 --> 35:05.343
And I know where
we can find a stuffed bear.

35:10.067 --> 35:13.230
Well, it looks like
a monster attack is what
this place needed, eh?

35:13.320 --> 35:16.153
Look at that—
159 a night now.

35:17.950 --> 35:19.941
Come on. Hurry, honey.
Slow down, honey.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.946
That’s a bear.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.166
One of the bear’s incisors
has been removed.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.416
I can use the corresponding
incisors to confirm...

35:32.506 --> 35:35.839
that the tooth
used to stab Coleman
came from this bear.

35:35.926 --> 35:38.588
- I expect nothing less.
- Back again.

35:38.679 --> 35:41.091
Yeah. Wow. Business
really is booming, isn’t it?

35:41.181 --> 35:44.139
Well, I hate that it came on the back
of Mr. Coleman’s misfortune,

35:44.226 --> 35:45.807
but I’m grateful
for the guests.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.759
- Can I see your hands?
- My hands?

35:47.855 --> 35:50.688
Yeah, you know, the things at
the end of your arms there—
your hands.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.730
Look at that—
rope burns.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.480
That’s what happens
when you hoist animals up
to drain their blood.

35:55.571 --> 35:57.061
Isn’t that right, Randy?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.911

36:06.999 --> 36:10.082
It’s my job to determine whether
you’re capable of murdering
and mutilating a human being.

36:10.169 --> 36:13.627
[ Chuckling ]
A guy would have to be crazy to
do something like that, right?

36:13.756 --> 36:16.293
What do you think?
Yeah, I guess so.

36:16.383 --> 36:18.590
I’m not crazy, so I guess
I couldn’t have done it.

36:18.677 --> 36:21.168

36:27.269 --> 36:30.261
- Can you explain that?
- Look, I didn’t kill him.
I’m not crazy.

36:30.356 --> 36:33.268
You just said that
as though you know
who did kill him.

36:33.359 --> 36:36.271
- I did?
- Yes. Do you know
who killed him?

36:36.362 --> 36:38.148
No. How would I?

36:39.239 --> 36:40.900
Right.

- Hmm? Oh, don’t worry.
ljust advise the FBI.

36:46.497 --> 36:50.706

decide who’s arrested
and tried for murder.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.249
So, what are you tellin’ ’em?

36:52.336 --> 36:55.578
I am advising them
that in my professional
opinion, you’re lying.

36:55.672 --> 36:58.209
That and the rope
and the skin cells—

36:58.300 --> 37:00.040
they’ll probably arrest you.

37:00.135 --> 37:01.875
You’ll be needing
a lawyer.

37:01.970 --> 37:05.133
- All right.
Thank you for your time.
- Wait.

37:07.059 --> 37:11.143
l-l didn’t kill the guy,
but I... did the rest.

37:12.898 --> 37:16.436
- “The rest”?
- Yeah, the draining
of the blood, the heart.

37:16.527 --> 37:18.267
Yes, I did that stuff.

37:18.362 --> 37:21.399
- Why?
- I came across the body.

37:21.490 --> 37:25.824
Since he was already dead,
I thought if it looked like
he was killed by the chupacabra,

37:25.911 --> 37:28.072
then he wouldn’t
have died in vain.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.906
You know,
most people who find
a corpse in the woods,

37:32.000 --> 37:33.661
they’d call the police.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.084
The lodge is in debt.
I was gonna lose it.

37:36.171 --> 37:39.584
Coleman was my best chance
at saving my business.
That’s not crazy, is it?

37:39.675 --> 37:41.666
Exactly how did you
fake the attack?

37:43.554 --> 37:46.261
Took the bear tooth
and made the bite marks with it,

37:46.348 --> 37:49.090
spread some insecticide around,
make it smell like sulfur.

37:49.184 --> 37:51.436
And then you
tore out his heart...

37:51.520 --> 37:53.727
and hung him up
to drain the blood?

37:53.814 --> 37:56.430
But I didn’t shoot the guy.

37:56.525 --> 37:59.858
Nobody said anything
aboutshooﬂng.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.436
- Well, I just meant—
- Who did? Who shot him?

38:02.531 --> 38:06.319
It wasn’t me. I didn’t even
have the heart to kill the goat.

38:06.410 --> 38:09.368
Where’s the bullet?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.656
I buried it with the heart.

38:14.751 --> 38:17.413
Since I didn’t kill the guy,
that’s not so bad, is it?

38:18.881 --> 38:21.873
No, it’s bad.
It’s very bad, Randy.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.590
Very bad.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.309
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.979
I wanna show you
something on the rope.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.522
Oh. Oh, good.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.771
What?
You seem nervous.

38:41.862 --> 38:44.319
Truth be told, I thought
that you might be upset...

38:44.406 --> 38:47.148
that I told the world
I was sleeping with your wife.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.075
Vincent, you were drunk.
Come on. I understand.

38:50.162 --> 38:53.620
Oh. Oh, wonderful.
[ Chuckles ]
Okay, the rope.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.824
Yeah, yeah. Just take a look
at the epithelial cells
through the microscope.

Mm-hmm.

than before to me.

that’s what I thought, too,

39:05.886 --> 39:08.878

I was just checking.

’Cause it’s not

So I went back
into the audio database.

of a man-made deer call.
[Grow/ing]

39:56.687 --> 40:00.646

What about the second sound?

- [ Rumbling ]
- A motorcycle?

four-stroke engine.

his own fault for not wearing
an orange vest in the woods.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.704
This is why
I’m against hunting.

40:59.791 --> 41:03.283
- Not because of Bambi?
- All right. Mostly because of Bambi.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.870
Melissa told Randy
what happened, and he used it
to his own advantage.

41:06.965 --> 41:11.208

had just worn an orange vest,
he’d still be alive,

have mutilated him
