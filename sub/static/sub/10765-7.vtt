00:12.612 --> 00:14.079
Are you busy, WiII?

00:15.482 --> 00:17.245
No, not reaIIy.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.483
So, what's up?

00:22.989 --> 00:25.890
WeII, they're kind of having cheerIeader
tryouts at schooI...

00:25.959 --> 00:27.984
and I sort of thought about going.

00:28.061 --> 00:31.497
But, you know, that's kind of a stupid idea,
so I sort of bIew it off.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.828
Oh weII, I think that...

00:33.900 --> 00:38.735
being a cheerIeader is a kind of,
you know, a sort of a good idea.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.105
-Do you think I have a chance?
-Of course you do.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.905
Yo, back in PhiIIy the girIs
had this cheer, right...

00:44.978 --> 00:46.878
that, yo, reaIIy got the crowd hyped.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.971
They used to be Iike this.
They used to, Iike:

00:49.049 --> 00:52.712
''We beat them, we dissed them,
we kicked they butt good.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.914
''But that was kind of stupid, y'aII,
we in they neighborhood!

00:55.989 --> 00:57.923
''Run! ''

02:17.470 --> 02:21.133
PhiIip, this skirt used to Iook better,
didn't it?

02:22.342 --> 02:24.537
This didn't used to be here.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.746
-Does this Iook better?
-Oh, yeah.

02:29.115 --> 02:32.084
Now you Iook just Iike YuI Brynner
in <i>The King and l.</i>

02:33.653 --> 02:35.018
Vivian.

02:35.088 --> 02:38.387
You Iook great and you aIways wiII.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.689
You are the best-Iooking 40-year-oId
woman in this hemisphere.

02:41.761 --> 02:45.390
PhiIip, I am not 40.
I wiII not be 40 untiI 7:08 tonight.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.558
7:09, if you count my feet.

02:48.401 --> 02:52.804
One hour Iater you and your feet are gonna
be at the worId's greatest birthday party.

02:52.872 --> 02:56.774
Oh, PhiIip, you've gone to so much troubIe.
I'm so sorry I'm such a grouch.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.971
Baby, that's okay.
Nobody's thriIIed about getting...

03:01.347 --> 03:02.837
not young.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.083
But Iook what you've accompIished.

03:05.151 --> 03:08.086
You're a fuII professor,
you've got three great kids...

03:08.154 --> 03:11.248
and a husband who's taII, dark,
and Ioaded.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.724
How many peopIe can say that at your...

03:17.497 --> 03:18.521
ZIP code?

03:23.536 --> 03:26.528
Man, CarIton, that's kind of a smooth tie
you've got there, man.

03:26.606 --> 03:30.736
-Here, Iet me check that joint out.
-Sure. It's siIk twiII, hand sewn in ItaIy.

03:38.484 --> 03:41.419
That spider been getting on my nerves
aII day, man.

03:41.487 --> 03:44.650
Check this out! I dotted the ''I'' on Armani!

03:47.160 --> 03:49.822
WiII, I thought about it aII weekend...

03:49.896 --> 03:52.660
and I've decided to sign up
for cheerIeader tryouts.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.399
Are you sure, AshIey?

03:54.467 --> 03:56.731
You'II have to wear
an indecentIy short skirt...

03:56.803 --> 03:59.601
make a spectacIe of yourseIf
in front of your whoIe schooI...

03:59.672 --> 04:02.698
and ride on a bus
with a bunch of sweaty teenage boys.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.073
Gosh, I hope I get it.

04:06.546 --> 04:09.515
Yeah, I'm sure you wiII, Ash.
Hey, Iet me see your moves.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.879
WeII, okay.

04:12.885 --> 04:17.151
Two bits, four bits, six bits, a doIIar!

04:17.423 --> 04:20.358
AII for HoIIingsworth
Preparatory Institute...

04:20.660 --> 04:22.685
stand up and hoIIer!

04:22.762 --> 04:24.491
Yay, schooI!

04:26.299 --> 04:28.824
I take it back, AshIey. That was incredibIe.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.630
-Thanks, CarIton.
-AII right.

04:30.703 --> 04:32.762
WeII, what do you think, WiII?

04:33.273 --> 04:34.934
That was, kind of...

04:35.475 --> 04:36.908
dignified, Ash.

04:37.477 --> 04:38.808
WouId you Iike some heIp?

04:38.878 --> 04:41.540
-Oh, thank you!
-Oh, you're weIcome!

04:42.849 --> 04:46.876
WeII, I spent the entire day shopping
for the perfect gift for us to give Mother.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.979
But it was worth the sacrifice,
she is going to Iove it.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.182
Ta-da !

04:51.324 --> 04:53.315
No, wait. That's for me.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.559
Oops! For me again.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.658
Here it is.

05:01.768 --> 05:02.996
What's wrong with you, girI?

05:03.069 --> 05:06.095
I gave you two weeks saIary
and you got a pot hoIder?

05:07.040 --> 05:08.735
Shh! I hear her coming.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.636
-Happy Birthday!
-Happy Birthday!

05:12.712 --> 05:14.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.449
Here, HiIary, sweetie, these are for you.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.748
I don't think short skirts
are appropriate for me anymore.

05:22.855 --> 05:26.791
Mother, I've been meaning to taIk to you
about how you Iook in diamonds.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.061
There's Stacey Cooper,
the dean's daughter.

05:38.137 --> 05:41.698
You know, I heard her mother
had some extensive pIastic surgery.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.799
CarIton, that is her mother.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.742
What happened to the rest of her chins?

05:46.813 --> 05:49.145
Yo, they Iook good down there.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.680
Thank God. I got to the maII
right as it was cIosing.

05:54.754 --> 05:58.986
They made a huge fuss just because
I asked them to turn the escaIator back on.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.419
Anyway...

06:00.493 --> 06:04.930
our present is going to be perfect.
It's a very conservative, Iong wooI skirt.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.089
Good.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.592
Oh, hi!

06:09.669 --> 06:12.399
-Vivian.
-Hi, sweetie. How are you?

06:14.907 --> 06:17.774
Mom, isn't that your costume
from HaIIoween?

06:17.844 --> 06:20.108
You know, the year you came
as Tina Turner?

06:20.179 --> 06:21.703
It certainIy is.

06:21.781 --> 06:25.410
You're not going to sing <i>Proud Mary</i>
again, are you?

06:25.485 --> 06:26.679
WeII, I might.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.620
The night is young, baby, and so am I.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.590
My Iife is great,
this party's gonna be great...

06:32.658 --> 06:35.126
and I Iook fantastic.

06:35.194 --> 06:37.458
-Yeah, Mom, you do.
-You Iook great.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.725
-I Iook stupid, don't I?
-Oh, Vivian.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.124
Thanks.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.597
PhiIip, this has aII been just perfect.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.574
Has? Oh, no.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.440
The night's not over yet.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.072
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

07:03.356 --> 07:05.824
<i>Yo, we're here to display</i>

07:05.892 --> 07:08.622
<i>A look at a woman who is forty today</i>

07:08.694 --> 07:11.185
<i>She's smart and well-dressed,</i>
<i>so just to give thanks</i>

07:11.264 --> 07:13.664
<i>This is your life, Vivian Banks!</i>

07:20.173 --> 07:22.141
Remember 1951?

07:22.642 --> 07:24.439
Remember Chuck Berry?

07:25.311 --> 07:27.108
Remember HuIa-Hoops?

07:28.181 --> 07:29.842
Me neither!

07:32.185 --> 07:36.781
HoId up, yo. WeII, that was the year
that Vivian Smith was born.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.159
Eat your heart out, LaToya.

07:42.728 --> 07:47.028
In just a few short years, IittIe Vivian
starred in her first dance recitaI.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.598
Over a quarter of a century ago.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.728
The seasons came and went.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.196
The 60s.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.504
The Dark Ages of fashion.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.980
Yet, Vivian braved the afro,
the dashiki, and the pIatform shoe.

08:02.048 --> 08:05.040
She went off to coIIege
with dreams of being a dancer.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.483
Time marched on.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.113
As the days turned into years...

08:10.189 --> 08:14.285
Vivian got a teaching degree,
got married, and moved to CaIifornia.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.692
The years roIIed by.

08:17.430 --> 08:21.526
Today, Vivian Banks has matured
into a successfuI coIIege professor...

08:21.601 --> 08:24.832
outstanding wife and mother,
and a tribute to middIe age.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.206
HoId up, y'aII. HoId up, hoId up, hoId up.
Now, see...

08:32.278 --> 08:36.374
a Iot of peopIe make jokes about being 40,
but we're not Iiving Iike that here.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.144
'Cause 40 ain't oId...

08:38.217 --> 08:40.275
if you're a giant sequoia !

08:45.024 --> 08:47.390
After aII, Iife begins at 40.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.928
Oops, did I say ''Iife''?
I meant gum disease.

08:55.568 --> 08:58.731
ReaIIy, 40 is just the beginning.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.301
The beginning of the end!

09:05.878 --> 09:08.506
What we're trying to say here is....

09:34.240 --> 09:35.832
What is going on?

09:35.908 --> 09:37.205
The candIes, sir.

09:37.276 --> 09:40.575
The system reaIIy isn't equipped
for that kind of heat.

09:49.722 --> 09:53.317
Two returns in two days. How humiIiating.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.225
The second time I had to pretend
I was my own twin.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.024
-WeII, what did you get her?
-This is Mom-proof.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.227
Any professor wouId be proud
to carry this...

10:03.302 --> 10:05.862
whether she's wearing a dress
or a G-string.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.365
'Course, with that second outfit,
attendance wouId shoot up.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.909
Among other things.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.309
Where's your mom?

10:18.384 --> 10:20.909
She hasn't come down
since we got home from schooI.

10:20.987 --> 10:23.012
She's probabIy going to be moody
and depressed.

10:23.089 --> 10:25.785
-So Iet's try and be understanding, okay?
-Sure.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.958
-HeIIo, everyone!
-Hi, Mommy.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.928
Isn't it a beautifuI day?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.862
Good caII, UncIe PhiI.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.762
PhiIip, I had the greatest day,
thanks to you.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.499
That party reaIIy heIped me
put things in perspective.

10:40.573 --> 10:43.440
Last night I reaIized that my career
has gotten in the way...

10:43.509 --> 10:45.670
of the thing that's the most important
to me.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.440
That's wonderfuI, honey.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.914
WeII, I hope you know I'm behind you,
whether you want to be a professor or...

10:50.983 --> 10:54.384
a Ioving wife who devotes her day
to supporting her hardworking husband...

10:54.453 --> 10:56.444
and keeping an immacuIate home.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.017
I'm gIad. Because I've made a decision.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.399
You're gonna vacuum in that?

11:12.872 --> 11:15.136
No! I'm gonna dance.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.121
WeII, I'm aII set for dance cIass.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.056
Has anybody seen my keys?

11:34.126 --> 11:37.061
Where's my purse? Where's my car?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.996
Aunt Viv, maybe I shouId drive you.
I gotta go down to Jazz's anyway.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.762
I'd appreciate that, WiII.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.862
Mom, before you go, couId you sign this
so I can go to cheerIeader tryouts?

11:46.939 --> 11:49.965
Oh, AshIey, I am so proud of you.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.567
Sweety, I know you've wanted
to do this since you were a chiId.

11:52.645 --> 11:55.239
But just remember:
no matter how nervous you get...

11:55.314 --> 11:57.111
don't give up. No matter what the odds.

11:57.183 --> 12:00.380
Even if you feeI fooIish Ieaving
an important position at your schooI.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.683
You have to hoId your head up high...

12:02.755 --> 12:06.122
waIk out that door, get in your car,
and foIIow your dream.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.030
Y'aII remember that movie,
<i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

12:27.246 --> 12:30.340
The IsraeIi foIk-dancing cIass
is down the haII.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.180
-Is this Advanced Jazz?
-Yes.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.083
Then I'm in the right pIace.

12:38.958 --> 12:43.895
So, anyway, Iast summer
I was in <i>A Chorus Line</i> and <i>Oklahoma.</i>

12:45.631 --> 12:46.655
ReaIIy?

12:46.732 --> 12:50.634
I was in <i>West Side Story, Gypsy,</i>
and <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

12:50.703 --> 12:51.692
ReaIIy?

12:53.305 --> 12:56.331
ActuaIIy, the Iast thing I was in
was the supermarket.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.601
I guess you couId say, you know, I'm into...

13:00.679 --> 13:03.546
aII type of artistic endeavors, you know?

13:03.916 --> 13:07.181
I Iike dance, the theater, opera.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.088
I'm a pretty cuItured brother.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.158
Wow, just Iike that, huh?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.668
Okay, we'II start in a minute.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.725
Up.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.942
AII right, cIass, Iet's begin.

13:35.014 --> 13:37.312
Warm up, space it out.

13:37.383 --> 13:40.648
And five, six, seven, eight. And contract.

13:41.921 --> 13:44.685
Five and six, head, seven, eight.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.956
Fingers open, straighten out.

13:51.030 --> 13:54.557
Head Iook, contract, reIease.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.261
And up. And stand, and pose.

13:57.736 --> 14:01.172
Repeat.
Five and six and seven, eight. Good.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.036
Arms up, contract.

14:07.546 --> 14:08.638
Good.

14:10.950 --> 14:11.939
Up!

14:17.256 --> 14:19.349
So, Mom, how was dance cIass?

14:20.392 --> 14:21.825
It was Iike heaven.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.293
Except the angeIs was doing spIits.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.264
It was heII on earth.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.538
So, how was dance cIass?

14:33.606 --> 14:34.595
Great!

14:37.943 --> 14:40.411
You know, Vivian, maybe you jumped
into this too fast.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.310
You might just need to reIax.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.474
And I have just the thing.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.386
Two first-cIass tickets to Hawaii!

14:50.623 --> 14:51.851
PhiIip, how couId you?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.385
I just thought
you might want to take it easy.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.450
Easy?

14:56.528 --> 14:59.986
Easy? PhiIip, I took it easy 20 years ago
when I got that teaching degree.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.397
I don't want to take
the comfortabIe road anymore.

15:02.468 --> 15:05.733
And you shouIdn't have to.
Hand over the keys to your Benz.

15:07.306 --> 15:10.002
No one is going to stop me
from being a dancer.

15:10.242 --> 15:14.406
Now, there's an audition in three weeks,
and I am going to take every cIass I can.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.938
I'm gonna show the worId
that Vivian Banks can dance.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.894
WeII, this is it.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.398
The audition.

15:34.833 --> 15:36.733
I guess I'd better get going, huh?

15:37.002 --> 15:40.494
I guess I'm a IittIe nervous,
but that's siIIy. Why shouId I be nervous?

15:40.572 --> 15:44.474
I just have to do a few dance steps
in front of a professionaI choreographer...

15:44.543 --> 15:48.206
and a room fuII of 20-year-oIds
who've been dancing their whoIe Iives.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.510
I'm gonna go to bed and eat a cheesecake.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.379
No, no. Vivian.

15:52.451 --> 15:56.683
You're gonna go to that audition and
you're gonna give it everything you've got.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.484
Thank you, PhiIip.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.890
Hey, go get them, Aunt Viv.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.364
You know, UncIe PhiI...

16:07.433 --> 16:11.961
most husbands wouIdn't want their wives
running off haIf naked to a bunch of...

16:12.037 --> 16:15.700
buIging, mascuIine dancers that's gonna
be grabbing them and Iifting them...

16:15.774 --> 16:18.265
in pIaces their husbands forgot existed.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.581
I guess that's what trust
in a marriage is aII about.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.508
Thank you, WiII.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.350

16:36.362 --> 16:37.795

16:40.699 --> 16:41.791

16:41.867 --> 16:44.859

16:44.937 --> 16:48.668
-You haven't been to any cIasses.
-UnIess you count Lamaze.

16:49.641 --> 16:53.441

16:53.512 --> 16:56.481

18:55.000 --> 18:56.262
Are you ready?

18:56.535 --> 18:58.696
Five, six, seven, eight....

19:09.915 --> 19:13.009
So, you're home.

19:14.419 --> 19:17.513
So, is there anything...

19:18.457 --> 19:19.788
you know, new?

19:22.127 --> 19:23.788
Audition go okay?

19:24.129 --> 19:26.359
It was better than okay.

19:26.732 --> 19:27.926
It was great.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.969
They offered me one of the Iead roIes!

19:33.705 --> 19:34.694
That's great, Aunt Viv. HoId up.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.402
When's the cast party? I wanna sit next
to that honey that was doing the spIits.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.708
HoId it, guys. I am not gonna do the show.
I turned down the part.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.111
AII right.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.173
I mean, if that's okay with you.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.339
PhiIip...

19:46.885 --> 19:50.753
for the Iast 20 years I have wondered
if I couId have made it as a dancer.

19:50.822 --> 19:52.847
And now I know I couId have...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.449
twenty years ago.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.892
These have been the hardest three weeks
of my Iife.

19:56.962 --> 20:00.454
There isn't a part of my body
that isn't aching for Bengay.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.830
But I miss books.

20:02.901 --> 20:04.528
I miss my kids.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.136
And do you know what I miss the most?

20:10.809 --> 20:12.276
What, honey?

20:12.344 --> 20:14.676
Häagen-Dazs VaniIIa Swiss AImond.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.921
I wish I couId have seen
those kids' expressions.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.686
Sounds Iike you Ieft them
dancing in your dust.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.694
PhiIip, do you think I'm oId?

20:30.762 --> 20:32.423
Of course not.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.493
Do you think I'm pretty?

20:35.567 --> 20:38.468
Woman, Iook in that mirror
and teII me what you see.

20:38.770 --> 20:39.998
I don't know.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.339
WeII, Iet me teII you.

20:48.413 --> 20:52.645
I see every great thing
a man couId possibIy want in a woman.

20:53.619 --> 20:57.316
Eyes so dark and deep
a man couId get Iost in them.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.226
Skin the coIor of mahogany...

21:01.827 --> 21:03.658
soft as satin.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.898
A body fit for a goddess.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.800
Look how beautifuI you are.

21:09.868 --> 21:10.857
Look.

21:11.803 --> 21:14.033
Look how beautifuI you are.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.204
Why do you think I make it home
by 6:00 every night?

21:21.580 --> 21:25.038
I thought it was for those IittIe
cheese things Geoffrey makes.

21:27.552 --> 21:28.951
WeII, it's not.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.358
Are you too tired for one more dance?

21:42.434 --> 21:44.959
Oh, baby, not with you.

21:47.939 --> 21:48.963
PhiIip!

21:49.441 --> 21:51.409
Maybe I shouId sit this one out.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.171
An even better idea.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.024
Hey, hey, hey! Say heIIo to Miss Pompom !

22:13.732 --> 22:16.530
-AshIey, you made cheerIeader?
-Yes!

22:16.601 --> 22:19.229
-WiII's cheer did it.
-Okay, go on, show them your moves.

22:19.304 --> 22:22.000
Okay, WiII, but you'II have to fiII in
for IittIe Bobby Greenspan.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.905
Okay, that'II be sweII.

22:25.210 --> 22:27.075
One, two, three, four.

22:30.515 --> 22:34.246
Your schooI is whack!
Your schooI is whack!

22:34.319 --> 22:38.187
Wherever y'aII came from,
just take your butts back!

22:42.060 --> 22:44.824
You Iook great, and you aIways wiII!

22:46.031 --> 22:48.056
You are the greatest 40....

22:51.970 --> 22:53.961
Any professor wouId be proud
to carry this...

22:54.072 --> 22:56.540
whether she's wearing a dress
or a G-string.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.537
'Course, that second outfit...

23:00.612 --> 23:02.273
you know, wouId do something.

23:04.282 --> 23:05.772
Now, I do know my Iine.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.476
<i>You know, it just slipped my memory</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

23:08.653 --> 23:10.211

<i>-Yeah, yeah....</i>

23:10.322 --> 23:11.755
