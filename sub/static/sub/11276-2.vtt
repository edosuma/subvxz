Woods, refill, please.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.000
Yeah, sure.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.300
Whatever you want.

00:10.300 --> 00:12.300
Hey, hey, hey.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.400
Why so down                     
in the mouth there, bud?

00:14.500 --> 00:16.100
Well, I'm understudying     
         another play,

00:16.100 --> 00:17.400
and I know I'm never gonna

00:17.400 --> 00:18.900
get to go on,                   
because the star

00:18.900 --> 00:20.400
never gets sick.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.700
But, darn it, the part     
    is perfect for me.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.200
Yeah?                           
What is that part?

00:24.200 --> 00:25.300
Moses.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.100
My theater group

00:28.100 --> 00:29.500

00:29.500 --> 00:31.300
<i>An Evening With the Prophets.</i>

00:31.300 --> 00:32.700
Mm.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.900
I got more lines than any       
of the other Israelites.

00:35.000 --> 00:35.900
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:35.900 --> 00:37.800
But I managed to jam      
          them all in,

00:37.800 --> 00:38.700
right up here.              
                         Mm.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.300
Yeah, your head                 
looks packed, all right.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.600
Go on, test me.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.100
Give me a cue.                  
                      All right.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.600
( <i>muttering</i> )

00:46.600 --> 00:47.900
Well, what's the first line?

00:48.900 --> 00:51.300
"And I have said        
      I will bring you up

02:24.800 --> 02:26.400
Thank you.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.200
Boy, what a day.                
                        Yeah?

02:28.200 --> 02:30.300
Yeah, I can't wait              
for it to end.

All I can think about           
is getting home

Hi. Sam Malone.

Hi. Suzanne Porter.

How do you do?

02:42.400 --> 02:46.200
Sam, you done picking   
        up on this lady?

02:46.300 --> 02:47.300
( <i>clears throat</i> )

02:47.400 --> 02:48.300
Not quite, Woody.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.700
Well, I'm sorry to     
         interrupt you, but, uh,

02:50.700 --> 02:51.500
Denise called.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.000
Oh, Denise.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.400
Who's Denise?

02:56.500 --> 02:58.800
Um... uh,      
             my brother's kid.

02:58.900 --> 02:59.900
Uh, Denise.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.700
Yeah, I have to say hi
          to her, and De-nephew.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.500
( <i>both laughing</i> )

03:05.600 --> 03:08.400
Very smooth, Sam.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.700
Very funny.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.300
Uh, so who's    
                this Denise?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
Aw, she was somebody...

03:12.400 --> 03:14.600
we had quite a thing            
going there a while ago.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.300
And then we both realized       
that sex wasn't anything

03:17.300 --> 03:19.100
to base a relationship on, so...

03:19.200 --> 03:20.700
six months later,               
we broke up.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.100
NORM:       
                    Uh-huh.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.500
Yeah, she must be quite a dish

03:23.500 --> 03:24.900
if you're willing to pass up

03:24.900 --> 03:26.700
on door number 
                 one over there.

03:26.700 --> 03:27.900
Well, it's kind of              
like avocados.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.500
One of them's ripe,

03:29.500 --> 03:31.700
and ready to be squashed        
into guacamole.

03:31.700 --> 03:34.000
And the other one needs         
to stay on the shelf

03:34.100 --> 03:35.800
a little while longer.

WOODY:                          
Well, anyway,

03:39.200 --> 03:40.400
call her back--                 
she says it's urgent.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.300
Ah, with the accent     
        on "urge," huh?         
                        Hmm!

03:43.300 --> 03:44.900
Actually, you know,       
          I think, uh,

03:44.900 --> 03:47.500
this is a call I should     
    return in person.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.600
Aw, Sam!        
                      Whoa, hey!

03:51.300 --> 03:52.400
Where are you going?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.200
Uh, to my niece's house.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.500
Her grandma's sick.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.000
If it's your niece's grandma,

03:57.100 --> 03:58.800
wouldn't that be your mother?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.500
My mom's sick?         
          Oh, my God!

04:04.700 --> 04:07.200
Excuse me. Why don't            
you stick around for            
a little while?

04:07.200 --> 04:10.100
My mom bounces right back.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.700
Hey, Sam, hey, uh,

04:19.700 --> 04:21.800
back from the Denise            
decathlon, huh?

Got a, uh, another gold medal

04:24.600 --> 04:28.100
in the "broad" jump?

04:28.100 --> 04:31.200
You know,               
  you got a big mouth, Clavin.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.700
Hey, he happens                 
to be right, you know.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.900
Yeah, it's a genetic quirk      
in the, uh, Clavin family

04:37.000 --> 04:38.900
that we all have                
two extra teeth.

04:38.900 --> 04:40.200
Yeah, you see,

04:40.200 --> 04:41.800
that's the only way             
that we can prove

04:41.800 --> 04:46.000
that we are the rightful heirs  
to the Russian throne.

04:46.100 --> 04:49.800
Hello in there, Cliff.

04:49.800 --> 04:50.900
Tell me...

04:50.900 --> 04:54.400
what color is the 
              sky in your world?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.300
What's wrong?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
Carla, I just want to be left

04:58.500 --> 04:59.600
alone for a while, all right?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.300
You got it.                 
                  Thank you.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.100
Hey, everybody,                 
Sam wants to be left alone!

05:04.100 --> 05:06.300
Okay, Sammy,                    
spill your guts.

05:06.300 --> 05:07.500
What's the matter?

05:07.500 --> 05:09.300
Carla, I just said
              that I-I want...  
Yeah, but

05:09.300 --> 05:10.700
you're gonna end up             
telling me eventually,

05:10.700 --> 05:13.000
so you might as well            
get it over with.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.200
Go on,                          
make you feel better.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.700
Just keep this
                  to yourself.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.100
Remember how I went    
         over to Denise's house?

05:20.100 --> 05:23.900
Well, she... she didn't invite
  me over for a good time.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.900
She wanted to     
              show me something.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.400
What?

05:28.500 --> 05:30.000
My child.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.900
Seven pounds,   
                ten ounces,

Sam Malone finally got caught

05:46.000 --> 05:47.900
with his hand in the cookie jar.

( <i>laughs</i> )

05:49.800 --> 05:50.300
Carla, come on.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.100
This is serious.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.500
Oh, of course it is, Sam.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.400
But I really think              
you're gonna be okay, you know?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.300
Yeah?         
Just remember this.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.600
This little piggy               
went to market...

Would you...?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.600
This is <i>not</i> funny.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.100
I'm sorry.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.400
You sure it's yours?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.200
No, it's between me       
        and another guy.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.500
But the kid's a real looker,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.700
so, you know,          
    you figure it out.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.900
So when are you         
      gonna find out, Dad?

06:21.900 --> 06:23.000
Soon.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.000
I mean, she dragged me down   
            to a lab

06:25.100 --> 06:27.100
to have a blood test.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.400
Well, what's                    
the big deal, you know?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.200
You can just do                 
what all the other jerks do.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.700
You pay a little money          
for support,

06:31.700 --> 06:33.000
and you get off the hook.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.700
No, Carla, it means a lot more 
        to me than that.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.900
I'm telling you,        
 if this, if this kid is mine,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.600
then... then I want             
to see that he's fed,

06:40.600 --> 06:43.000
that he's clothed,          
    and that he's educated.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
You know,                       
I'm-I'm gonna take

06:44.100 --> 06:45.700
him to, to              
Little League games, too.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.500
I'm gonna be the    
            best damn father    
            you've ever seen.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.000
Please don't let
                him be mine!

06:50.000 --> 06:51.900
Oh!

06:51.900 --> 06:53.600
Oh!

06:53.600 --> 06:56.100
I tell you, if I get      
  out of this, I swear to God,

06:56.100 --> 06:57.900
I am through fooling around   
            forever.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.900
Sam, don't swear to God.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.000
No, I mean it, I mean it,       
     if I get out of this,

07:02.100 --> 07:03.800
I swear to God,         
I'll never have sex again.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.900
You?

07:06.900 --> 07:08.400
Never?

07:08.500 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, not ever.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.800
I mean, for the rest...

07:10.800 --> 07:14.100
Well, three months,       
         three months.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.800
Well, I guess the amount of sex 
    you have in three months

07:17.900 --> 07:20.500
is what most people       
      have in a lifetime.       
Huh.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.600
If they're attractive, I guess.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.400
You have a phone call      
          from Denise.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.200
( <i>sighs</i> )

07:30.800 --> 07:33.000
Oh, and Carla,    
              you know that, uh,

07:33.100 --> 07:34.900
pitcher of beer       
          you left on your tray?

07:34.900 --> 07:36.900
Some guy from table six
         came and drank it.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.200
We don't have a table six.

07:40.200 --> 07:43.700
I knew I should have said       
          table five.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.900
Hello.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.900
Oh, hi, Denise.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.400
Um, what'd the doctor say?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.100
Oh, thank God,         
         oh, thank God!

07:52.100 --> 07:53.800
Oh, thank God! Oh!

07:53.800 --> 07:55.500
Oh, I'm so happy.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
Well, I'm so happy          
    for the other guy.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.900
Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.300
Congratulations, huh?

08:00.400 --> 08:01.800
All right, we-well,       
         I'll call you

08:01.800 --> 08:03.300
some other time         
        then, all right?

08:03.300 --> 08:04.300
Bye-bye.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.700
Doctor, Sam?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.700
Uh, yeah, uh,

08:08.700 --> 08:11.600
Denise and I and this, uh,      
        other guy

08:11.600 --> 08:13.100
share the same doctor

08:13.100 --> 08:14.700
and she just wanted
             to let me know

08:14.700 --> 08:16.500
that he had gotten          
    some new magazines

08:16.500 --> 08:18.000
in the waiting room.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.700
You lucky dog!

08:21.700 --> 08:25.000
Must be the       
              <i>Sports Illustrated</i>
             <i> "Swimsuit Issue."</i>

08:28.800 --> 08:31.200
Say, uh... Suzanne,       
     uh... what do you say,

08:31.300 --> 08:32.700
you want            
to help me celebrate here?

08:32.799 --> 08:34.500
I'd love to.          
                          Great.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.900
What are we celebrating?

08:35.900 --> 08:37.200
I have no idea,   
              but whatever it is

08:37.200 --> 08:39.799
we're overdressed.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.100
( <i>Carla clears throat</i> ):
        Sam?

08:41.100 --> 08:43.200
Yeah?                     
        Uh, Sam, aren't you     
        forgetting something?

08:43.299 --> 08:45.600
I know, I know, I'm gonna       
  drop by the old drug store.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.000
Don't worry,                    
I learned my lesson.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.400
Could you wait just...?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.500
What?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.800
Does the name "God"
             ring a bell?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.200
Yeah?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.100
The guy you         
            made a vow to?

08:57.100 --> 08:58.600
Oh.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.400
Yeah, boy, I almost             
forgot about that.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.700
Uh... it's no big thing.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.400
"No big thing"?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.300
Come on, God's a sport.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.800
People make promises            
like that all the time,

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
but if God had to collect       
on all of them,

09:11.900 --> 09:14.500
He wouldn't have any time       
to create

09:14.600 --> 09:16.200
natural wonders like that,      
         for instance.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.300
I'll see you...                 
Oh, boy.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.400
Give me a minute here.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.500
CARLA:        
                  Listen, Sammy,

09:20.500 --> 09:22.500
I don't want to tell you        
how to run your life,

09:22.500 --> 09:25.300
but I want to tell you this:    
don't mess with God.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.900
Look at all the people          
in the Bible who did.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.700
The entire population           
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

09:30.700 --> 09:35.200
Lot's wife-- turned into        
a salt lick with boobs.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.300
Come on, what...

09:39.400 --> 09:41.100
What's He gonna do--            
reach down from the clouds

09:41.100 --> 09:42.800
and snatch me up?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.100
You know, you...

09:44.100 --> 09:46.600
Halt, infidel!

10:01.300 --> 10:03.000
Hey, sorry, Sam.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.100
Uh, I was just at               
an understudy rehearsal.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.600
I thought you might get         
a kick out of my costume.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.000
( <i>panting</i> ):            
        You ought to warn people

10:10.100 --> 10:12.600
before you go around    
        pretending to be God.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.800
You thought I was God?

10:14.800 --> 10:18.000
Thanks.             
 I was only trying to be Moses.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.100
Hey, guys, he thought I was God!

10:21.700 --> 10:23.900
Sam, can we go now?

10:23.900 --> 10:24.800
Yeah, you bet.

10:24.900 --> 10:25.900
No, no, Sam!

10:25.900 --> 10:27.900
He has sent   
                  His messenger.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.200
Me...? What messenger?

10:29.300 --> 10:31.100
That is just Woody.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.800
You think it's a coincidence
    that Woody came in

10:33.800 --> 10:36.200
just at that very moment
        dressed as Moses?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.900
I mean, of all the plays he
     could have been in, Sammy.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.700
He could have been     
         dressed as Auntie Mame.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.600
Would that have
                 scared you?

10:42.600 --> 10:45.300
Yeah, a little.

10:45.400 --> 10:48.000
Let's face it, Sam,
             that was a warning,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.400
and you'd better
                take heed.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.400
Oh, come on,                    
what's He gonna do?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.300
Well, my cousin Tino...

10:58.300 --> 10:59.300
Yeah?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.000
...swore he'd   
                give up meat.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.200
That night,     
                he ate a burger.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.600
The next day,      
             his teeth fell out.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.000
Oh, come on, Carla.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.300
There's no connection here.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.900
I swore I would                 
not have sex, so...

11:10.900 --> 11:12.900
( <i>shudders</i> )

11:17.200 --> 11:21.200
Listen, I-I-I'm not       
  really in the mood anymore.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.400
Why not?

11:23.700 --> 11:26.900
Carla's cousin Tino's      
        teeth fell out.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
Yeah, well, maybe               
some other time.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.800
Uh...   
        Why don't you           
        give me a call?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.700
Yeah. I-I don't     
            have your number.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.000
Perfect.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.700
Oh... are you satisfied,    
      God's Little Helper?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.600
Oh, listen, Sam.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.400
Uh, in the interest             
of authenticity,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.300
you think there's anyway        
I can sound

11:48.400 --> 11:50.200
less like God                   
and more like Moses?

11:50.200 --> 11:52.300
Yeah, stop going      
          around scaring people.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.800
That's good.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.900
That's good,          
now, how 'bout the voice?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.300
Now sit down.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.800
Now...

12:04.900 --> 12:06.700
how can I be of help?

12:06.700 --> 12:09.800
Well, I would like          
      your advice, Father.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.900
Actually, it's for          
    a friend of mine.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.500
He, uh...

12:15.500 --> 12:18.000
got himself into kind of a bind,

12:18.000 --> 12:23.900
and so, in desperation, promised
  God he'd give up something.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.400
And what did he promise     
          to give up?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.400
Sweets.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.700
Oh.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.600
I see.             
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )

12:33.600 --> 12:35.700
Yeah...

12:35.700 --> 12:38.100
but my friend          
really likes sweets a lot.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.500
You know, and sweets      
        like him a lot.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.600
And he hasn't had sweets now  
      for about two weeks,

12:45.600 --> 12:48.800
and if he doesn't have sweets  
soon, he's gonna explode.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.600
I see, and God's        
     contractual obligation

12:53.700 --> 12:56.500
was to get your friend     
 out of this bind you spoke of.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.500
Yes, sir. Which He did.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.000
Well, then, what is the problem?

13:01.100 --> 13:05.100
Well, m-my friend was wondering 
what the penalty would be

13:05.200 --> 13:08.500
if he, say... you know, had a...

13:08.500 --> 13:11.500
huge box of chocolates.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.500
Sam, I think this is between you
         and your God.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.700
Yeah, right.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.700
Oh, how did...

13:20.700 --> 13:22.900
How'd you know it was me?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.900
In all the years people     
     have been coming here

13:25.000 --> 13:29.700
for their friends, I have never 
met one of their friends.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.400
Oh, well, yeah,         
     as long as I'm busted,

13:32.400 --> 13:34.500
I guess I might as well tell you

13:34.500 --> 13:35.300
the truth here.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.500
I-I didn't promise              
to give up sweets.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.100
I promised to give up sex.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.800
Ah...

13:41.800 --> 13:45.400
that is a tough one.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.900
You know, Sam, the Church

13:48.900 --> 13:52.600
does recommend chastity     
      to unmarried people.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.800
( <i>chuckles</i> )

13:55.900 --> 13:58.300
Oh, I'm sorry.         
    You were serious. Uh...

13:59.900 --> 14:01.700
How do you do that?

14:01.700 --> 14:03.200
I mean, what do <i>you</i> do?

14:03.200 --> 14:04.800
How do you not?

14:04.800 --> 14:07.300
I mean, a-are there             
special tricks, or a

14:07.300 --> 14:10.900
certain way           
    of sitting, maybe?

14:12.200 --> 14:16.600
Well, yes, but we are strictly 
    forbidden to reveal it.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.000
You're kidding.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.500
Yes.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.200
Oh.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.500
You know, Sam, I think     
you're looking for someone

14:27.500 --> 14:30.200
to tell you it's all right      
    to break your vow,

14:30.200 --> 14:33.400
but I can't
                     do that.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.400
You know, I've found that people
         who come here

14:36.400 --> 14:40.400
looking for answers usually   
    know what the answer is,

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
and I think you do, too.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.800
Yeah, maybe.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.100
Well, thank you.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.100
Oh...

14:48.100 --> 14:49.800
Oh, no, no, no.

14:55.700 --> 14:56.700
SAM:            
                Carla, Carla?

14:56.700 --> 14:58.300
Oh, great.             
         Look. I think I got it.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.000
God's gonna have   
             to accept this one.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.100
"With the Lord, one day
         is as a thousand years,

15:03.100 --> 15:06.300
and a thousand years
            is as one day."

15:07.900 --> 15:08.600
So?

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
So that means

15:09.600 --> 15:12.500
I've been out of action
         for 21,000 years.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.500
Come on, that's got to 
         be good enough for Him.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.600
You know, Sam, I-I'd            
like to agree with you--

15:16.600 --> 15:18.900
( <i>sighs</i> )   
since you're so                 
pathetic it's annoying--

15:19.000 --> 15:20.200
but no sale.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
All right, all right,      
 I still got Deuteronomy here.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.000
Don't look, Sammy.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.900
Temptation at 12:00.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.900
Oh...

15:31.900 --> 15:33.200
Oh... Oh, God.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.000
Man, they're coming in waves.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.400
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

15:39.400 --> 15:41.400
Cheers.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.100
Yeah, this is him.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.200
You're kidding.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.400
Moses has an ear infection.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.500
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.300
I'll be right there.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.100
So, Woody, they gonna           
let you go on?

15:55.100 --> 15:56.900
Uh, no, I got to stop      
        by the drugstore

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
and pick up some antibiotics.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.200
So, believe it or not,     
  I've given up sex entirely.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.500
But you got to promise          
not to tell anybody.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.400
Well, Sam,     
                 confidentiality

16:07.500 --> 16:09.100
is the bedrock      
            of my profession.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.800
Besides, who'd
                  believe me?

16:11.900 --> 16:12.900
You were saying?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.100
Well, I was just wondering      
what you think I ought to do.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.500
Well, you need to find

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
another outlet for      
        your sexual energies.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.500
Mm-hmm.                 
              For example,

16:21.500 --> 16:25.000
during six painfully frustrating
months of my adolescence,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.500
I built a submarine             
in our basement.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.700
One of those          
          little plastic models?

16:30.700 --> 16:32.500
No, life-size. Slept six.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.700
The happiest hours              
of my youth were spent

16:35.700 --> 16:39.000
down there in the dark          
shouting, "Fire one.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.500
Fire two."

16:42.800 --> 16:44.400
Well, enough about me.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.700
Let's address                   
this problem, Sam.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.300
Well, I don't know        
      anything about submarines.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.200
Well, surely you                
have other interests.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.400
Sports, sailing, music?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.900
Well, yeah, I had a
             piano lesson once.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.400
Actually, I had     
            the piano <i>teacher</i>

16:58.400 --> 16:59.600
and it was twice, but...

17:01.700 --> 17:03.400
I liked it.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.400
Well, I'll tell you.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.599
If you were to sit down         
at the piano today

17:06.599 --> 17:08.800
and channel your energies       
into it,

17:08.900 --> 17:10.599
you would find                  
all your sexual tensions

17:10.599 --> 17:12.200
pouring out                     
through your fingertips.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.900
Yeah, fingertips.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.099
Yeah, right.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.300
And best of all, Sam,

17:16.300 --> 17:19.900
no matter how badly you perform,
     a piano never laughs.

17:20.700 --> 17:21.900
Never stomps out of the room

17:21.900 --> 17:24.099
and refuses to let you     
play again for three days.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.000
Well, I'm off to Lilith.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.200
( <i>yawning</i> ):       
                 Sam?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.500
Would you please
                lock up?

17:35.500 --> 17:37.100
Uh, yeah.               
I'm going home to bed.

17:37.100 --> 17:40.200
Okay, good night.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.600
Did you hear me?

17:42.600 --> 17:45.000
I said I'm going                
to go to bed.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.200
Well, I hope you, uh,

17:46.300 --> 17:48.300
get a good night's sleep.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.600
Thank you.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.900
Carla, I just left myself       
        wide open

17:54.000 --> 17:57.400
for one of Sam's sleazy remarks,
          and nothing.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.200
I mean, not that I want to,     
but what does it mean

18:00.200 --> 18:04.200
when you can't turn on the      
horniest guy that ever lived?

18:04.200 --> 18:06.300
I am really getting old.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.000
Oh, Rebecca, would you
          stop being ridiculous?

18:09.000 --> 18:11.800
You're still a young,      
    beautiful, vibrant woman

18:11.800 --> 18:13.400
with her whole life       
         ahead of her.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.100
Oh, you're just saying that.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.500
Yes, I am.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.100
I was taught to humor old folks.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.900
Carla, I ca...

18:25.900 --> 18:27.800
I can't take this anymore.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.500
I mean, I tried everything.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.200
I've stopped eating oysters,

18:31.300 --> 18:32.500
I'm taking cold showers,

18:32.500 --> 18:35.600
I even started stuffing ice   
         in my pockets.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.500
I tell you, I'm not going       
          to make it.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.500
Oh, Sammy, buck up.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.500
You only have          
     nine more weeks to go.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.000
I'm talking about tonight.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.400
Guess who?

18:54.400 --> 18:55.900
Uh-oh.          
I'll give you a hint.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.500
Vermont ski lodge,              
a roaring fire,

18:58.500 --> 19:00.200
and baby oil.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.400
Uh... could you, uh,

19:02.400 --> 19:05.200
be more specific?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.500
Gravity boots.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.100
Oh, Rachel Patterson.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.400
( <i>laughs</i> )                    
            Oh, look...

19:09.500 --> 19:11.300
Hi, Sam, how are you?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.500
Oh, boy.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.200
I tell you, honey,    
          you're the last person

19:14.200 --> 19:16.300
in the world I want
             to see right now.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.600
Nice to see you, too.

19:17.700 --> 19:18.700
Uh...

19:18.700 --> 19:20.400
Listen, I have got              
an 18-hour layover,

19:20.500 --> 19:23.200
and I'm not                     
the least bit sleepy.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.700
How'd you like to help me       
kill some time?

19:25.700 --> 19:27.200
Listen, what, um...

19:27.200 --> 19:29.900
Actually, I hear, uh,   
        movies are good for     
        that kind of thing.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.800
Why don't you, uh, why 
         don't you take in about

19:32.800 --> 19:35.000
two or three          
     right in a row, there?

19:35.100 --> 19:37.800
I know-- smell.

19:37.900 --> 19:41.300
I'm wearing that perfume    
that always drove you so crazy.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.100
Oh, Devastation, huh?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.700
Uh...

19:44.700 --> 19:48.100
Actually, I got this, uh,       
        this head cold.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.400
Uh, I wouldn't want
             you to catch it.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.300
Um, I'm sorry, uh...

19:52.300 --> 19:55.000
what do you say,        
     some other time, huh?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.900
Well, okay.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.100
Oh, Sam?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.300
Yeah?

20:01.300 --> 20:02.700
A friend of mine                
snapped this

20:02.800 --> 20:04.600
of me on a beach in Ipanema.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.300
I thought               
     you might like a copy.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.300
Oh.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.200
Would you excuse me

20:14.200 --> 20:15.700
just for a  
                    minute here?

20:19.900 --> 20:22.000
Look at this!

20:24.400 --> 20:26.800
I mean, this is not fair.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.000
I mean, I'm going for it.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.400
It's-it's not          
  like I'm murdering anybody.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.800
I-I'm just going to bring   
    a great deal of pleasure

20:33.900 --> 20:35.900
to two people.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.800
So, if in Your,         
      uh, infinite wisdom,

20:39.900 --> 20:42.300
You feel You have           
    to smite me down,

20:42.400 --> 20:45.400
then please           
  make it quick and painless.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.800
And if You could give me    
    about three hours,

20:48.900 --> 20:51.400
I'd appreciate it.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.700
Okay.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.700
Sam?

21:04.900 --> 21:07.800
( <i>sniffing</i> )

21:07.900 --> 21:10.400
Devastation.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.500
The hound is loose.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.200
Please, go easy on him.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.900
Sammy, now you've done it.

21:29.900 --> 21:34.200
There's nothing   
              in your future but
              frogs and locusts.

21:34.300 --> 21:37.100
Why'd you have to   
            go and do it, Sammy?

21:37.100 --> 21:39.000
I didn't do it.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.100
What?

21:40.100 --> 21:41.900
I didn't do it.

21:41.900 --> 21:44.200
We went to the hotel,

21:44.200 --> 21:46.400
she got into bed,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.600
I got into bed with her.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.100
Then I was folding up my socks, 
          and I was...

21:51.200 --> 21:52.400
You fold up                     
your socks?

21:52.400 --> 21:55.000
Sure. I'm not an animal.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.800
Anyway, all of a sudden,    
         for no reason,

22:01.800 --> 22:03.000
I went over and I,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.400
and I opened          
     the nightstand drawer.

22:05.400 --> 22:09.100
And there it was,           
    staring right up at me.

22:09.100 --> 22:11.100
The Bible.

22:11.200 --> 22:14.900
Can you imagine that--     
    a Bible in a hotel room?

22:16.600 --> 22:18.400
So, we... we got out of there  
          real quick,

22:18.500 --> 22:20.900
and we got another room, and...

22:20.900 --> 22:22.600
there it was again.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.300
I mean, we... we went      
     from hotel to hotel,

22:26.400 --> 22:28.200
and it just followed us     
    wherever we went.

22:29.100 --> 22:31.100
Then it dawned on me.

22:31.200 --> 22:34.000
This was a bona fide miracle.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.200
God was speaking

22:35.200 --> 22:38.800
to me directly         
through hotel nightstands.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.700
He works in mysterious ways.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.500
Amen. Amen.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.900
Excuse me,  
                    Sam, but, uh

22:47.900 --> 22:49.100
in all the years        
      you played baseball,

22:49.100 --> 22:50.300
traveling               
    throughout the country,

22:50.300 --> 22:52.200
all the hotel rooms       
         you stayed in,

22:52.200 --> 22:53.500
didn't you ever once notice...?

22:53.600 --> 22:56.100
Uh, Frasier,                    
Sam was just telling us

22:56.100 --> 22:57.400
about a miracle

22:57.400 --> 23:00.000
that affected him               
very deeply.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.300
Now, what was it        
    that you were noticing?

23:04.200 --> 23:06.600
Well, th-they always put    
  those little strips of paper

23:06.600 --> 23:07.700
across the toilets.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.700
Just an observation.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.100
Sammy, I'm so proud of you.

23:16.100 --> 23:16.800
( <i>chuckling</i> ):      
                Yeah.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.300
If you could hold out      
          last night,

23:18.400 --> 23:20.000
you can make it         
    the whole three months.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.400
Sam, I'm late for a party.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.700
Can you help me     
            with this zipper?

23:33.700 --> 23:35.400
Sam? Sam?                       
Sam? Sam?

23:35.500 --> 23:36.500
Sam...!

23:36.500 --> 23:38.500
Piano. Piano, Sam.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.400
For God's sake, piano!

23:41.500 --> 23:42.800
