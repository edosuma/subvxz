WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:07.139
(wind roaring, thunder rumbling)

00:07.141 --> 00:08.040
This is the captain!

00:08.042 --> 00:09.308
You saw what?!

00:09.310 --> 00:13.012
I said no one, repeat,
no one goes on deck

00:13.014 --> 00:14.113
Until this passes!

00:14.115 --> 00:15.114
Where is he?

00:15.116 --> 00:17.282
Get two men out there now!

00:17.284 --> 00:20.185
Rescue the son of a bitch
and bring him to me.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.658
Captain wants us
back inside asap!

00:26.660 --> 00:29.361
This is bad!
Why do we got to go out there?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.396
Got orders.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.197
Bridge saw
somebody on deck.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.198
Ah, orders my ass.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.566
This is a full-on,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.602
Stain-your-shorts
white squall, man.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.203
My mama
didn't raise no fool.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.238
Your mama's not here.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.306
Captain says
now, so move.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.378
Let's do it, forrest!

00:46.380 --> 00:47.713
All right, let's go!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.184
Oh, man!

00:54.421 --> 00:56.055
(screaming)

00:56.057 --> 00:57.423
I got you!
(grunting)

00:57.425 --> 00:58.757
Hook on!

01:05.065 --> 01:07.232
Come on!

01:14.808 --> 01:17.142
There he is!

01:17.144 --> 01:18.577
I can see him!

01:18.579 --> 01:20.779
On the deck!

01:20.781 --> 01:22.247
He's not moving!

01:22.249 --> 01:24.216
We got to get down there!

01:25.819 --> 01:27.386
Hook on!

01:29.155 --> 01:32.691
(both yelling)

01:33.726 --> 01:36.595
(both grunting)

01:38.131 --> 01:41.633
Tell the captain
we need a doctor!

01:43.403 --> 01:45.604
This is the doctor!

02:23.676 --> 02:25.677
The unexpected storm
off the eastern seaboard

02:25.679 --> 02:27.646
Caught fishing
and u.S. Navy vessels

02:27.648 --> 02:28.914
By surprise last night.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.183
The coast guard rescued
over a dozen people

02:31.185 --> 02:33.619
Associated with the squall

02:33.621 --> 02:36.555
That pounded the virginia
coast, then quickly dissipated.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.223
Now it looks
like we're gonna see...

02:38.225 --> 02:40.292
Coast guard officials
have yet to release

02:40.294 --> 02:42.594
The exact number of injuries
connected to the storm,

02:42.596 --> 02:46.231
But estimate the damage
to be in the millions.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.367
Tony, really?

02:48.369 --> 02:50.202
Sorry, I happen to prefer
the weather report on znn.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.203
Yeah, I'm sure.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.338
I mean, she's extremely...

02:53.340 --> 02:54.573
Bright, articulate.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.574
Chelsea--

02:55.576 --> 02:57.442
She's a crack
meteorologist.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.944
(scoffs)
her name is

02:58.946 --> 03:01.547
(seductively):
Chelsea?
Oh, yeah.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.949
Do you know, she has
a master's in earth science,

03:03.951 --> 03:06.218
And her favorite cloud's
cumulonimbus.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.519
How would you know that?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.555
It's all over
her personal web page.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.323
And it has pictures.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.958
Really good pictures.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.494
Where's mcgee?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.963
Maybe he blew away coming
to work this morning.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.264
Or maybe he met someone
last night.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.265
That's doubtful.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.433
That might be the reason

03:21.435 --> 03:22.634
<i>I</i> would be late.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.736
These days, my friend,
I'm not so sure.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.904
You've noticed?

03:25.906 --> 03:29.208
Yes, I am quite aware
you hit a...

03:29.210 --> 03:30.809
Dry spell recently.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.377
Like <i>lawrence of arabia.</i>

03:32.379 --> 03:33.812
(chuckles)

03:33.814 --> 03:35.447
You know,
maybe it's not a woman,

03:35.449 --> 03:36.648
Maybe it's a flat tire.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.750
Maybe he stopped for doughnuts.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.386
Perhaps he slipped in the shower
and he can't get up.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.554
Bought one of those for my dad.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.556
Let's go.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.392
Uss    <i>borealis</i>scheduled
arrival's in one hour.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.494
Got a murdered
officer on board.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.996
Where's mcgee?

03:50.998 --> 03:52.331
Overslept.
Doctor visit.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.701
Uh-huh.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.338
(grunts)

04:03.243 --> 04:05.544
(video game sound effects
playing)

04:08.248 --> 04:10.816
So how much do you make
being a big brother?

04:10.818 --> 04:12.417
It doesn't pay anything.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.852
It's a volunteer program.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.688
So you actually make nothing
to spend time with me?

04:16.690 --> 04:19.391
Believe it or not, adam,
I want to.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.362
Did you have a big brother
growing up?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.631
No, I wish I did.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.467
My dad was at sea a lot
when I was a kid.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.972
You know,
even though my mom has the flu,

04:33.974 --> 04:39.678
What, and miss an overnight trip
to colonial williamsburg?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.613
People in puffy shirts
making candles and soap?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.649
No way am I gonna
let that happen.

04:45.451 --> 04:46.652
Thanks, mr. Mcgee.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.754
Call me tim.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.389
I'm glad I could help.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.324
(cell phone ringing)

04:52.326 --> 04:54.993
Who's gibbs?

04:54.995 --> 04:57.562
Oh, boy.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.633
Where did they move the body?
Sick bay,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.735
But those two didn't touch him.
Who did?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.903
Agent afloat.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.305
Ziva:
On a destroyer?

05:06.307 --> 05:08.440
Yeah, the ships
were on their way back from

05:08.442 --> 05:09.908
Unitas exercises
in latin america.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.443
Carrier agent cross-deck, huh?

05:11.445 --> 05:14.413
Could have sworn it was
that guy hatfield

05:14.415 --> 05:16.048
Out of mayport.
I think you're wrong.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.916
Look who I found.
Tony: Hey.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.018
If it isn't stan the man burley.
How you doing?

05:20.020 --> 05:21.620
Last time I saw you,
you were up to your ears

05:21.622 --> 05:23.322
In italian signorinas,

05:23.324 --> 05:24.756
Red wine and thin-crust pizza.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.957
I only admit to the pizza.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.993
Stanley, good to see you.
You, too, sir.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.995
Wish it was under
better circumstances.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.863
I boarded the ship
as soon as I could.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.365
I marked the
location of the body

05:33.367 --> 05:36.401
They were pretty contaminated
after the storm.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.803
Tony:
Hard not to be contaminated
with chicken of the sea

05:37.805 --> 05:39.938
Sliding all over the deck.
Mcgee: Boss, I'm sorry.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.341
I know, I know,
I'm an hour and 46 minutes late.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.942
47, tim tebow.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.777
Better put a knee down,
start praying.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.113
Gibbs:
Let's go, mcgee,
sick bay, come on.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.015
I love when he's late.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.487
Talk to me, duck.
Well, regrettably,

05:55.489 --> 05:58.957
The commander was
not on deck last night

05:58.959 --> 06:00.525
Singing in the rain.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.993
Got any idea what killed him?

06:01.995 --> 06:04.429
Oh, hard to say till
I get a better look.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.832
But I think one
can safely assume

06:06.834 --> 06:10.435
That that is not a bite
from a hungry mosquito.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.071
Maybe a syringe?

06:13.073 --> 06:16.908
It-it almost intrigues me
how some people

06:16.910 --> 06:18.543
Bruise more easily than others.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.613
My cousin beatrice had
incredibly white skin.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.782
I remember vividly
when she was giving blood

06:23.784 --> 06:25.884
When her mother needed
a transfusion,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.919
Her arm had
needle marks on it

06:27.921 --> 06:29.020
For over two weeks.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.422
Hey, duck.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.490
Oh.

06:31.492 --> 06:35.727
Assume that this bruising
meant that the commander

06:35.729 --> 06:37.796
Was on the move
when he was jabbed.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.398
Jimmy: After the
commander was jabbed,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.533
He probably stumbled
outside in search of help.

06:41.535 --> 06:45.504
Picked a heck of a time to take
a stroll on the lido deck.

06:45.506 --> 06:46.638
(laughs)

06:49.442 --> 06:52.444
Lido deck, it's, um,

06:52.446 --> 06:53.478
Uh...

06:53.480 --> 06:54.946
<i>The-the love boat.</i>

06:54.948 --> 06:56.448
Uh, captain stubing

06:56.450 --> 06:58.450
Always used to say that, um--

06:58.452 --> 06:59.751
See, now, the lido deck

06:59.753 --> 07:01.420
Is a cruise
ship reference,

07:01.422 --> 07:03.555
And, uh, I-- never mind.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.589
Special agent gibbs,
may I have a moment?

07:07.460 --> 07:09.428
Mcgee, statement from
the hospital corpsmen.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.595
Get details.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.696
On it, boss.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.765
Officer on board
needs to talk to you.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.534
Officer have a
name, captain?

07:15.536 --> 07:16.735
Lieutenant mane, admiral's aide.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.437
Captain says
you're the agent in charge.

07:18.439 --> 07:19.771
How can I help you,
lieutenant?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.907
We came aboard the <i>borealis</i>
<i>during exercises.</i>

07:21.909 --> 07:23.875
Then our helo was grounded
due to inclement weather.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.610
Despite the tragedy here,

07:25.612 --> 07:27.446
I'm afraid the admiral
still has a schedule to keep.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.014
We got a crime scene, mane.
Can't let you leave.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.849
That's not acceptable.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.684
What's not acceptable
is a dead navy commander.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.453
Who else can I talk to?

07:34.455 --> 07:37.589
If your admiral has an issue,
he should come to me, directly.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.591
Special agent gibbs.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.626
Your reputation
precedes you.

07:41.628 --> 07:46.731
Amazing what a little
thunderstorm can do, the damage.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.900
What can I do
for you, admiral?

07:48.902 --> 07:51.203
Get me off the ship.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.737
Gibbs:
Can't.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.005
Admiral:
Sure you can.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.607
No, dad, he can't.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.777
A man died here today.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.111
Till we figure
out what happened,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.746
This whole crew's
on lockdown.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.849
Understandable,
but I have someplace to be.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.518
Been hearing that my whole life.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.888
(sighs)

08:09.890 --> 08:11.623
Good to see you, too, son.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.201
I get updates
from tim's grandmother.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.637
Can't say I agree
with her politics,

08:25.639 --> 08:29.107
But I do appreciate
her fortitude.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.976
She's a good person, dad.

08:30.978 --> 08:34.546
If you don't mind aging hippies
with commie tendencies.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.047
(laughs)

08:38.017 --> 08:39.684
You attend all battle exercises,
admiral?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.119
Negative. Joined
halfway through.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.255
Boarded two carriers
before the <i>borealis.</i>

08:43.257 --> 08:44.823
All out of ushuaia.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.725
How long were you
in south america?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.126
Nine days total.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.228
Very hospitable people,
gorgeous women.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.231
How's your love life, tim?

08:54.066 --> 08:55.233
Did you know commander haber?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.604
We exchanged pleasantries.

08:59.606 --> 09:00.739
Decent man.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.007
Dedicated physician.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.676
I got to say, tim,
you look like hell.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.244
You need to take better
care of yourself.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.080
Being good at
science and math,

09:09.082 --> 09:11.182
That's all
well and good,

09:11.184 --> 09:13.184
But mit isolated you.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.186
You're too content
in your own little world.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.255
Boss, do you mind if I leave?
That's right, run away.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.090
Don't confront
the situation.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.759
God forbid,
just like your mother.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.027
You leave mom out of this.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.931
She with that real estate idiot
out of dallas?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.167
You see, agent gibbs,

09:29.169 --> 09:31.069
Every mistake
we ever made

09:31.071 --> 09:33.038
Raising tim and his sister
was my fault.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.774
Never mind the fact that
tim always had a safe home,

09:35.776 --> 09:38.176
Three solids and a family
who cared about him.

09:38.178 --> 09:39.911
No, mom cared.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.081
Your family was the navy.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.649
Still is, boy.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.251
Which is why I need to
get ashore immediately.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.253
Not until we finish
our investigation.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.892
This is what I'm talking about.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.360
You could learn a lot

09:55.362 --> 09:57.362
From agent gibbs;
he's got stones.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.265
You stay in your bunk,
admiral.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.200
Until you hear otherwise.
Are we clear?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.936
Crystal.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.111
(door opens)

10:14.914 --> 10:16.047
(door closes)

10:16.049 --> 10:19.250
How long did you work
under commander haber?

10:19.252 --> 10:20.318
Nine months.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.821
Commander was
always good to me.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.255
Respected my opinion.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.124
Seemed like the crew
appreciated him, also.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.294
Being a physician on a ship
like this is rough.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.096
Folks know
everybody's business--

10:31.098 --> 10:33.698
Who's sick, who's medicated.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.367
There are no secrets.
None.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.736
So when somebody
breaks the rules

10:37.738 --> 10:40.271
And starts abusing,
it dominoes quickly.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.172
How?

10:44.243 --> 10:46.811
Commander haber
was about to come forward

10:46.813 --> 10:48.146
With information
pertaining to

10:48.148 --> 10:50.315
A crew member's
illegal drug use.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.783
What kind of drugs?

10:54.220 --> 10:55.387
Agent asked you
a question, graves.

10:57.356 --> 11:00.091
Crews work long hours.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.093
They're tired, edgy.

11:02.095 --> 11:05.263
There's an amphetamine/adhd
cocktail

11:05.265 --> 11:07.365
That's been going around.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.969
And who is the sailor
he was pinpointing?

11:10.971 --> 11:13.004
Believe me, I wish I knew.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.106
Commander wouldn't say.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.276
Thanks.

11:20.379 --> 11:24.015
Secnav knows that commander
haber's body's being transported

11:24.017 --> 11:25.450
Back here to dr. Mallard.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.752
The crew is
to remain on board.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.155
Admiral mcgee and his staff
are allowed to go.

11:30.157 --> 11:34.926
On the fast track to
a presidential cabinet position.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.461
I wouldn't want him
in my cabinet.
Look, gibbs,

11:36.463 --> 11:38.997
I'm well aware of the tension
between mcgee and his father.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.298
Admiral disrespects everything
mcgee's earned.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.234
That the admiral's
a pain in the ass.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.769
I think you
should let tim know...

11:44.771 --> 11:46.971
That I got his
back, leon?

11:46.973 --> 11:49.040
I always have.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.710
(door closes)

11:51.712 --> 11:55.046
<i>For anything related to</i>
<i>what graves was talking about.</i>

11:55.048 --> 11:56.748
Come on.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.451
Man (over p.A.): Signal watch
officer to the signal bridge.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.053
I, uh, I heard about
your father, ziva.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.321
I'm sorry for
your loss.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.322
Thank you.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.457
I assume homeland and cia

12:05.459 --> 12:07.726
Are knee-deep
in it, huh?

12:07.728 --> 12:09.260
Are they any closer
to catching the guy?

12:09.262 --> 12:10.495
Ziva:
No.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.763
Not yet.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.034
Ah, hey.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.002
Look what I found.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.838
Doctor's medical logs.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.473
Commander was in charge
of the pharmacy.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.374
You think the stabbing
is drug-related?

12:23.376 --> 12:26.044
I know the <i>borealis</i>
<i>was anchored</i>

12:26.046 --> 12:27.378
In par'bo for a while.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.347
And nonstop
south america to norfolk

12:29.349 --> 12:31.049
Was a drug trafficker's
dream cruise.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.784
I love a good
all-you-can-smuggle buffet.

12:32.786 --> 12:33.785
We'd better comb through it all,

12:33.787 --> 12:35.487
See if anything's missing.

12:35.489 --> 12:36.521
Maybe the commander wasn't
willing to play ball.

12:36.523 --> 12:37.522
Agent burley and I

12:37.524 --> 12:39.390
Will go take
another look around.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.458
Right, burley?

12:46.298 --> 12:48.800
So, agent burley
was agent dinozzo

12:48.802 --> 12:50.268
Before agent dinozzo
was agent dinozzo?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.302
Ducky:
That is correct.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.038
One cannot help but be confused

12:54.040 --> 12:56.274
By the <i>downton abbey</i> complexity

12:56.276 --> 12:58.042
Of government bureaucracy.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.345
Yeah, the thing to remember
is that we are all

13:00.347 --> 13:02.947
But one stan burley away
from reassignment.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.482
And that's why
we should always,

13:04.484 --> 13:06.284
Uh, focus on
the job in hand.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.352
Oh.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.123
Yeah, I keep thinking about
the look on agent mcgee's face

13:12.125 --> 13:13.958
When he saw his dad.
Yes.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.860
We certainly can't
pick our fathers,

13:15.862 --> 13:17.362
Mr. Palmer.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.497
But the real tragedy

13:19.499 --> 13:21.366
Occurs when our
fathers do not

13:21.368 --> 13:22.801
Pick us.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.169
Anything?

13:24.171 --> 13:25.837
Your timing is impeccable.

13:25.839 --> 13:26.871
Look at that.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.239
Gibbs: Something
under the skin?

13:28.241 --> 13:29.841
Piece of a broken needle.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.442
Yeah, I'm sure
they had

13:31.444 --> 13:33.077
No intention of
leaving it behind.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.412
Jimmy:
Yeah, there's no
defensive wounds.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.980
Commander haber probably
never saw it coming.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.981
What was in the syringe?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.350
Cyanide, ethylene glycol,

13:39.352 --> 13:40.985
Eye of newt.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.520
That last one being unlikely.
(laughing)

13:42.522 --> 13:43.521
(chuckles)

13:43.523 --> 13:45.290
We sent samples

13:45.292 --> 13:46.291
To abby.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.458
Yes, I would
venture to guess

13:47.460 --> 13:48.526
That it's something
more slow-acting.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.462
You know, it's quite
extraordinary--

13:51.464 --> 13:54.399
With the chaos of the
squall on the ship,

13:54.401 --> 13:56.935
They just happened to hit
the carotid artery.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.606
Tony: <i>Telling you,</i>
<i>it was more than that.</i>

14:01.608 --> 14:04.108
Tony, you're letting your
imagination get the best of you.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.010
Stan was not flirting with ziva.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.280
Mm. Well, I noticed it
in Italy last year, too.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.149
Does burley look burlier to you?

14:12.151 --> 14:13.551
(mutters)

14:13.553 --> 14:15.153
Stan's a good guy.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.021
Besides, he knows that ziva's
vulnerable right now.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.223
Aha!

14:18.225 --> 14:20.158
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.293
You see, he could use that
to his advantage.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.494
Swoop right in,

14:23.496 --> 14:25.363
Like a hawk going after a sweet,

14:25.365 --> 14:28.233
Innocent, furry
little israeli...

14:31.003 --> 14:32.103
Boss, you're very stealthy.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.606
Uh, well, I have been
going through

14:34.608 --> 14:36.474
The commander's records,

14:36.476 --> 14:38.009
And one person
keeps flagging

14:38.011 --> 14:39.611
For multiple visits
to the sick bay.

14:39.613 --> 14:40.979
Name?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.214
Petty officer third class
kevin wyeth.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.617
23, divorced, no little wyeths.

14:45.619 --> 14:47.385
Three years in the military,
only operational tour

14:47.387 --> 14:48.486
Was on the <i>borealis.</i>

14:48.488 --> 14:50.288
Medical history?
Nothing unusual.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.557
Colds, minor injuries,
a staph infection.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.926
Tony:
Wyeth had a juvie record

14:54.928 --> 14:57.095
Also, when he first
joined the ship,

14:57.097 --> 14:58.529
M.A.'s detained him
for suspicion

14:58.531 --> 15:00.265
Of giving drugs
to another sailor,

15:00.267 --> 15:01.399
But they couldn't prove it.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.601
Dinozzo, you and burley
bring him in.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.636
Back to the destroyer.

15:04.638 --> 15:05.637
Thank you, boss.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.538
Loving the drive
to norfolk.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.240
Tony: <i>All I'm saying is</i>
<i>tread lightly.</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:10.608
Ziva's been through
a lot lately.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.343
Ziva? Fragile?
Yeah.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.446
Dinozzo, wait, you got...
You got it all wrong.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.948
I've seen you
work it, opie.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.316
Huh? Mr. Innocent
with the--

15:18.318 --> 15:20.385
Don't get me wrong,
you're a good guy, but...

15:20.387 --> 15:21.552
Tony, I'm engaged.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.621
She's an officer
in the uss <i>delarue.</i>

15:23.623 --> 15:25.223
Met about
a year ago.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.524
Right.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.293
Connie's completing
her next tour,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.128
Then taking a gig
in navy intel.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.930
Oh.
Guess my agent afloat
days are over, huh?

15:31.932 --> 15:35.533
Yeah, it's gonna be
a whole new chapter for me.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.335
You should try it.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.970
Maybe I will.

15:38.972 --> 15:39.971
(both chuckle)

15:39.973 --> 15:41.306
Is that him?

15:41.308 --> 15:42.307
Yeah.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.541
Petty officer wyeth?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.611
Ncis. We want
to talk to you.

15:47.646 --> 15:49.447
Oh, come on.
Oh, no.

15:51.517 --> 15:55.420
Tony: Petty officer, where
do you think you're going?!

15:58.490 --> 16:00.591
Burley:
Wyeth!

16:04.663 --> 16:07.598
We just want to talk, wyeth.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.246
(grunts)

16:25.284 --> 16:27.518
(groans)

16:30.356 --> 16:32.023
(groans)

16:32.025 --> 16:33.691
You all right?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.560
(grunts)
yeah.

16:35.562 --> 16:36.761
Thanks.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.297
You're too good to me.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.699
Consider it
an engagement present.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.778
Like what you see there,
petty officer wyeth?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.546
I know, sir.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.148
Not especially.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.584
Based on the bloods
we just took,

16:59.586 --> 17:02.787
(chuckles) kev, I got to say,
you are a, uh,

17:02.789 --> 17:04.622
A walking drugstore cowboy.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.625
Ups, downs, mood
stabilizers,

17:07.627 --> 17:10.194
Attention deficit pills.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.031
They're all, uh,
prescription and legit.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.532
Mm. Too legit
to quit?

17:14.534 --> 17:19.570
One or two, maybe,
but not all five at once.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.639
I, uh, I need them
for medical reasons.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.640
I see.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.275
And did a doctor tell you that?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.643
Yeah, I've talked to doctors.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.146
Well, you have got a long list
of juvie priors,

17:28.148 --> 17:31.482
A history of possessions
and, frankly, a blood workup

17:31.484 --> 17:34.552
That, uh, makes sid
vicious look clean.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.453
Sid who?

17:35.455 --> 17:36.621
Sid...

17:37.790 --> 17:39.490
Oh, boy.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.492
Here's what I think: I
think you were running low,

17:41.494 --> 17:44.095
So you went to go see haber.
No.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.164
I went to the doc
because I was sick.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.467
That must have been
kind of difficult, huh?

17:49.469 --> 17:50.535
Sitting in his office,

17:50.537 --> 17:52.703
So close to that
drug cabinet

17:52.705 --> 17:55.440
Filled with exciting drugs.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.742
The candy store,
just out of reach.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.112
I just wanted him to help me.
Mm-hmm.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.146
Enough to kill him?

18:02.148 --> 18:03.247
No.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.615
(panting)

18:04.617 --> 18:06.651
Where you going?

18:12.591 --> 18:14.325
Wow.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.260
You see, these are

18:16.262 --> 18:18.096
The side effects
from all the drugs.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.497
Knew it was only

18:19.499 --> 18:21.566
A matter of time before
all this caught up with me.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.568
All right.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.337
(sighs)

18:26.339 --> 18:28.840
Boss, there's no way
that shaky the clown could have

18:28.842 --> 18:31.676
Stabbed the commander
with that kind of precision.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.377
I know.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.114
Abby:
<i>Doctor,</i>

18:36.116 --> 18:38.749
This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.253
(computer beeping)

18:42.255 --> 18:43.654
(sighs)

18:43.656 --> 18:46.224
(computer beeping)

18:46.226 --> 18:47.391
Ouch.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.659
Abby, what are you doing?

18:48.661 --> 18:49.660
Here, grab a needle, mcgee.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.661
Start jabbing.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.663
Why?

18:52.665 --> 18:55.233
I have poked this guy
over a dozen times now--

18:55.235 --> 18:57.335
O-on the fly,
walking, running.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.604
The computer still says that
I haven't hit the carotid yet.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.739
I mean, try it.
It's practically impossible.

19:12.751 --> 19:13.751
(computer beeping)

19:13.753 --> 19:15.653
Can I stop now, please?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.155
So, ducky was right.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.724
The needle was filled
with a slow-acting

19:19.726 --> 19:23.594
Strychnine that led to paralysis
and eventually to asphyxiation.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.597
But the amazing thing
is how it was administered.

19:26.599 --> 19:27.598
Look at this.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.866
Okay, imagine,
if you will,

19:28.868 --> 19:30.268
A white squall.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.769
So, there's chaos
in the passageway,

19:31.771 --> 19:32.870
There's sweaty
sailors everywhere,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.505
But somehow, the killer

19:34.507 --> 19:35.940
Swoops in and bam.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.776
He nails the doctor first time
right in the carotid

19:38.778 --> 19:40.945
With this tiny little needle,
which, lucky for us,

19:40.947 --> 19:42.380
Breaks off and leaves the tip.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.582
But, I mean,
what are the odds, right?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.350
Think whoever did this
had special training?

19:46.352 --> 19:50.354
Or they're just really good
with tiny little pointy things.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.656
I'll tell gibbs.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.424
Mcgee?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.459
Everybody knows
it's been

19:55.461 --> 19:57.261
Really rough on you,
having your dad

19:57.263 --> 19:58.829
Just show up
like this.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.298
Maybe you should

20:00.300 --> 20:04.202
Stand up to him,
a-and tell him how you feel.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.571
You've spent your
entire life

20:06.573 --> 20:08.472
Avoiding this moment

20:08.474 --> 20:12.310
That could be... Liberating.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.612
Abby, he's the admiral.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.814
No one talks to him,
they just listen.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.916
(cell phone ringing)

20:20.719 --> 20:22.753
Mcgee.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.689
When?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.857
Okay, hang on.
I'll be right up.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.508
Mcgee's on his way.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.511
(sighs)

20:47.513 --> 20:49.747
Um, can we get
you anything?

20:49.749 --> 20:51.782
A soda, perhaps?

20:51.784 --> 20:53.918
Adam here doesn't need
a soda, ziva.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.653
Note the blank stare,

20:55.655 --> 20:57.455
Dilated pupils.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.490
He's probably running
a fever, as well.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.459
Because he's eyeing a real,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.927
Live female agent.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.796
You're the closest thing
to james bond's

21:05.798 --> 21:08.266
Honeychile rider
his turbulent,

21:08.268 --> 21:10.801
Roiling pubescent hormones
have ever encountered.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.737
Well, he's giving me
the creeps, tony.

21:12.739 --> 21:13.904
That'll stop.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.373
In about 60 years.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.643
Adam, you're supposed to be

21:18.645 --> 21:20.411
In williamsburg.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.445
How'd you get here?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.747
The bus.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.449
Once I saw who I was
sharing a hotel room with,

21:25.451 --> 21:26.617
I couldn't do it.

21:27.753 --> 21:28.819
Bobby moran.

21:28.821 --> 21:29.787
Bully?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.722
To the power of ten.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.324
Kids like moran
don't have much

21:33.326 --> 21:35.059
Time for nerds like me.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.594
Hey, you are not a nerd.
Yes.

21:36.596 --> 21:37.895
Yes, you are.

21:38.764 --> 21:39.897
But own it.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.966
My advice.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.301
It's okay, adam.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.702
Don't listen to him.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.537
But at some point,
we all need to learn

21:46.539 --> 21:47.672
To stand up
for ourselves.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.839
See, kids like bobby moran

21:48.841 --> 21:50.374
Aren't any better than you.

21:50.376 --> 21:52.677
And ten, 15 years from
now, when you're working

21:52.679 --> 21:54.779
In silicon valley,
making six figures,

21:54.781 --> 21:57.014
They'll still be stupid jocks
that peaked in high school.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.517
You think?

21:59.519 --> 22:00.518
I know.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.353
And I'll tell you
something else.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.554
Most bullies--

22:03.556 --> 22:05.022
Just big cowards.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.725
(cell phone ringing)

22:07.727 --> 22:11.796
Hey, burley, where are you
and what do you got?

22:11.798 --> 22:13.864
Burley: <i>I've been trolling</i>
<i>through surveillance footage</i>

22:13.866 --> 22:15.800
During the hours leading
up to the doctor's death.

22:15.802 --> 22:21.038
I think this is the moment
the commander was poisoned.

22:34.721 --> 22:37.955
Later that night,
petty officer daniel graves

22:37.957 --> 22:40.458
Snuck into the sick bay
and appears to be removing

22:40.460 --> 22:42.126
Data from the doctor's computer.

22:51.903 --> 22:53.137
Background.
Already ran it.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.972
Graves became a
hospital corpsman

22:54.974 --> 22:56.841
After failing navy
seal training.

22:56.843 --> 23:00.945
But couldn't handle the
psychological pressure.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.615
Maybe the commander
figured something out.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.883
I'll go talk
to the captain.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.118
You find graves.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.089
Lieutenant,
can you give us a moment?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.091
Of course, admiral.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.794
I'll be right outside.

23:18.864 --> 23:21.899
(door closes)

23:21.901 --> 23:23.934
I have to ask you
a personal question.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.903
Mm-hmm.
I want to know...

23:25.905 --> 23:27.538
(sighs)

23:27.540 --> 23:29.874
...Tim's status here at ncis.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.842
Meaning?

23:31.844 --> 23:34.945
Meaning, I want to know
if he'll ever amount

23:34.947 --> 23:38.048
To anything more than
an overpaid paper-pusher.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.618
(sets down glass)

23:40.620 --> 23:41.952
Let me explain something.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.454
Special agent mcgee

23:43.456 --> 23:45.723
Is a valuable asset
to this team.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.858
As a navy officer
and as a father,

23:47.860 --> 23:51.629
You should be proud of
what your son has accomplished.

23:51.631 --> 23:52.863
I asked for an assessment.

23:52.865 --> 23:54.965
(laughs):
I didn't ask for a lecture.

23:54.967 --> 23:58.969
So, why the sudden interest in
special agent mcgee's future?

23:58.971 --> 24:01.772
(sighs)

24:05.744 --> 24:08.579
You have a good evening,
director vance.

24:10.715 --> 24:14.018
Maybe one day you can teach
my son some of the boxing moves

24:14.020 --> 24:16.687
I hear have served you
so well.

24:16.689 --> 24:17.988
He needs 'em.

24:23.228 --> 24:25.896
Ziva:
<i>It does not make any sense</i>

24:25.898 --> 24:27.131
That a ship is still
in lockdown,

24:27.133 --> 24:28.866
Yet petty officer graves
never reported for duty.

24:28.868 --> 24:29.900
Where is he?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.502
He can't have
gone far.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.037
Graves has to be
somewhere on board.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.572
(cell phone ringing)

24:34.574 --> 24:35.773
Burley.

24:35.775 --> 24:36.774
When?

24:36.776 --> 24:39.844
Are they here now?

24:39.846 --> 24:40.845
Let me know.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.912
What happened?

24:41.914 --> 24:44.048
A crew member
is getting off the ship.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.149
It's a medical emergency.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.017
Sick bay reported
a ruptured appendix.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.486
Ambulance is waiting
on the pier.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.155
Who from the sick
bay called it in?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.564
(siren whoops)

25:06.238 --> 25:07.938
Federal agents.

25:07.940 --> 25:08.939
Don't move.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.774
Clever way off the ship, graves.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.042
Out of the ambulance.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.179
I have a signed order
sending him to a hospital.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.113
Signed by whom?

25:16.115 --> 25:17.114
The ship's doctor.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.549
Commander brian haber.

25:20.986 --> 25:22.887
(sighs)

25:31.830 --> 25:34.532
Fancy stuff with the ambulance.

25:34.534 --> 25:36.600
What are you running from?

25:42.073 --> 25:45.543
Pictures tell a
thousand words.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.780
These?

25:49.782 --> 25:52.182
Pictures get doctored.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.118
Easy.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.620
What if I tell you
half the crew gave you up?

25:58.189 --> 26:00.190
Do I need to get a lawyer here?

26:00.192 --> 26:01.892
I don't know, do you?

26:04.229 --> 26:07.064
I was trying to get rid
of the paper trail.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.332
The cocktail
that was going around...

26:08.334 --> 26:10.301
That came from you.

26:10.303 --> 26:13.237
Little extra pocket change, hmm?

26:13.239 --> 26:15.306
So why'd you tell
us about the drug?

26:15.308 --> 26:17.675
I mean, why...

26:17.677 --> 26:19.243
Why admit everything
just like that?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.911
Sir?

26:20.913 --> 26:25.783
To you, first thing out
of your mouth-- about the drugs.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.253
Now you're copping
to being the supplier.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.121
I didn't kill the commander.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.923
You doing something else
in sick bay?

26:37.996 --> 26:40.064
Petty officer graves...

26:41.933 --> 26:43.968
...Whoever you are covering for,

26:43.970 --> 26:47.304
You'd better ask yourself:

26:47.306 --> 26:49.006
Is this worth it?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.351
Your fingers, mcgee--
why are they not typing?

27:00.353 --> 27:03.354
Hey, boss, I was just, um,

27:03.356 --> 27:05.189
Running graves' e-mails
to see if anything flagged.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.190
Yeah?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.291
Anything flag?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.292
Nope.
Good.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.327
Go home, it's late.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.865
You know,
I kind of liked him.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.333
Really?

27:16.335 --> 27:17.968
I mean,

27:17.970 --> 27:19.370
I know he's kind of a blowhard,

27:19.372 --> 27:21.905
But I guess he's also got
his good qualities, too.

27:21.907 --> 27:23.374
I'm talking
about the little guy, mcgee--

27:23.376 --> 27:24.375
Adam.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.777
Oh, adam.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.346
Yeah, yeah, he's great-- adam.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.749
How long you been
helping him out?

27:31.751 --> 27:34.018
Couple months.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.087
It's a good thing you do.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.756
Actually I've been
thinking about moving on

27:38.758 --> 27:41.692
From the whole
big brother thing.

27:43.728 --> 27:45.963
That kid depends on you.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.799
With work, it's hard
to make the time,

27:48.801 --> 27:52.302
And it's probably better if they
just assign him to someone else.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.438
It's better?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.173
Who's it better for, mcgee?

27:57.142 --> 27:59.143
Well, for both of us.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.079
You know, I don't think
he really understands what I do.

28:02.081 --> 28:06.016
Let him know... Who you are.

28:10.255 --> 28:13.357
Are we still talking
about the little guy?

28:15.293 --> 28:17.828
Admiral mcgee: You going to
tell me why you called,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.364
Or am I supposed
to guess?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.866
I called for this.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.935
You called me
to take a walk?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.470
Yep.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.706
Is that what
you ncis people do?

28:30.475 --> 28:32.810
No, dad, it's
what sons do.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.779
You know, my
life is good,

28:35.781 --> 28:38.148
And I'm doing good
work right now.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.386
Just thought
you might want to know that.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.121
(sighs)

28:44.123 --> 28:46.123
I'm sure your mother
doesn't like this.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.058
She loves going
for walks.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.194
Not that-- this, us.

28:50.196 --> 28:52.329
You lost me.

28:52.331 --> 28:56.100
The fighting, tim,
the fighting.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.504
Have you talked
to her lately?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.273
No. But I know her.

29:05.210 --> 29:08.412
She's never liked it
when we...

29:08.414 --> 29:09.813
So change it.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.520
(chuckles)

29:18.389 --> 29:21.458
Your fifth birthday...

29:21.460 --> 29:23.460
I built that sandbox out back.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.497
You played so long and so hard,
you fell right asleep.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.769
And I was just
standing there...

29:31.771 --> 29:33.971
Looking at you, and...

29:35.907 --> 29:37.174
And what?

29:42.781 --> 29:45.783
That was a long time ago,
different time.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.418
Mane: Excuse me, admiral,
meeting at the white house.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.387
We need to get going.
Very well.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.456
Thank you, lieutenant.

29:56.127 --> 30:00.030
What was it you used to say
to me when I was shipping out?

30:00.032 --> 30:02.466
Watch out for the bad guys.

30:12.043 --> 30:14.444
(computer beeping)

30:14.446 --> 30:16.446
Tony:
Ten grand.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.016
Hardly worth graves
risking his whole career.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.151
What do we got?
Money transfer
into the hospital,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.453
Corpsman's personal
checking account.
Ten grand--

30:23.455 --> 30:24.855
Payment for who
he's covering up for.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.423
Source?
Still digging, boss.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.492
You know, burley, when
I was an agent afloat,

30:28.494 --> 30:30.060
Back in the good old days,

30:30.062 --> 30:31.595
There used to be
this clipboard sheet

30:31.597 --> 30:33.564
In the sick bay
with sign-in.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.232
It's gonna be hard
to track a clipboard.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.435
Unless the clipboard has 3g.
'cause my dentist

30:38.437 --> 30:40.103
Started using a tablet.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.572
There's this receptionist,
mallory--

30:41.574 --> 30:43.273
She's got the cutest little
heart-shaped...

30:43.275 --> 30:44.908
Hey. Burley,

30:44.910 --> 30:46.443
Closed-circuit images
of graves in sick bay

30:46.445 --> 30:48.078
Showed him walking off
with a tablet, right?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.847
Yeah, but I'm not sure
if the <i>borealis</i> made

30:49.849 --> 30:50.914
The switch
to electronic records.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.583
Let's find out.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.618
Agent mcgee won't mind
if I use his computer, right?

30:54.620 --> 30:57.454
Uh, now's not a good week
to poke the beaver.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.555
Uh, beaver?

30:58.557 --> 30:59.957
Mcgee:
Mit mascot.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.391
Sorry I'm late, boss.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.595
Just checking to see
if the <i>borealis</i> made

31:04.597 --> 31:06.463
The conversion
to paperless.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.966
Well, fourth fleet made
the switch two months ago,

31:08.968 --> 31:10.467
Which means,
if the tablet's connected

31:10.469 --> 31:13.136
To a network,
we can search its meid.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.172
I guess your engineers
trump my buckeyes.

31:15.174 --> 31:16.974
Go, bucks!
Mcgee:
Speaking of college,

31:16.976 --> 31:20.978
Our missing tablet is online
at john hamilton university.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.145
Go.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.621
Tablet computers are like
student loans around here.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.289
You sure you can track
this thing?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.291
Within 50 yards.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.426
But since it just dropped
off the cellular net,

31:36.428 --> 31:38.662
I'm gonna have to wait
for it to reconnect.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.299
College campuses always
bring back memories--

31:42.301 --> 31:44.368
Good and bad.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.570
Kind of like fathers.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.373
How long you been sitting
on that transition, tony?

31:49.375 --> 31:50.440
That's subtle.

31:50.442 --> 31:53.477
Well, between gibbs,
ziva and myself,

31:53.479 --> 31:55.112
There's no reason
to beat around the bush

31:55.114 --> 31:57.047
When it comes
to daddy drop-ins.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.515
Yeah, because those
all went so well.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.385
Two out of three
ain't bad.

32:01.387 --> 32:05.923
Look, the fact is,
fathers start out as...

32:05.925 --> 32:07.524
Heroes.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.359
They end up disappointing.

32:09.361 --> 32:12.596
So I should just skip to
hugs and signet rings?

32:12.598 --> 32:14.665
No, what about the part
where you painfully begin

32:14.667 --> 32:17.567
To understand
your old man's flaws?

32:17.569 --> 32:19.569
Because we share
them; I get it.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.104
But the admiral
never will.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.273
It's just, it's just
part of who he is.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.542
There's got to be something
that can soften him up.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.544
Signal's active again.
They're close.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.714
Please let it be
this sunbathing book club.

32:30.716 --> 32:33.650
Nope, it's
over there.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.254
Ladies.

32:37.256 --> 32:38.455
Oh, you can't hold me.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.023
I got it, baby!

32:40.025 --> 32:41.191
(men groaning)

32:41.193 --> 32:43.026
Had to be
sweaty ballplayers.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.728
How'd a navy computer
end up here?

32:44.730 --> 32:46.697
Yeah, well,
let's find out.

32:46.699 --> 32:48.198
Little help, my man?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.434
Federal agents.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.569
Have any of you acquired
a tablet computer

32:52.571 --> 32:54.037
In the last
24 hours?

32:55.373 --> 32:57.741
Sorry, genius bar,
can't help you.

32:57.743 --> 33:00.077
So if I checked these gym bags,
I wouldn't find anything?

33:00.079 --> 33:02.346
Wait, hold it.
You gonna touch our stuff?
You see the badge?

33:02.348 --> 33:04.414
You need a warrant.
You need a hook shot.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.183
(laughter)

33:06.185 --> 33:09.519
Possession of stolen military
hardware is a felony, lebron.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.088
Wait. Hold up.

33:11.090 --> 33:12.756
Nobody said anything
about stealing.

33:12.758 --> 33:15.025
Oh, so <i>you</i> have
the tablet?

33:16.694 --> 33:18.095
(groans):
Oh, man.

33:21.399 --> 33:24.234
Found it
in the trash yesterday.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.536
There was no name on it,
nothing.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.772
Look, I swear
that's the truth, man.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.441
Are we cool?

33:44.722 --> 33:47.090
Did mcgee say anything
about his dad?

33:47.092 --> 33:49.026
They spoke. I'm not sure
the admiral listened.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.028
Abby: I feel so
bad for mcgee.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.363
(typing)

33:53.365 --> 33:57.034
These things take time.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.236
Mcgee should be happy
they still have time.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.071
Mcgee: Well, luckily,
the memory wasn't

34:01.073 --> 34:03.173
Professionally wiped before
the tablet was thrown away.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.608
I can still access the records.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.243
Access 'em faster.

34:06.245 --> 34:08.412
I'm gonna go poke
my mannequin some more.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.780
That-that didn't sound right.

34:09.782 --> 34:13.717
All the names from the patient
log appear to be crew members.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.519
Nothing to suggest who could
have killed the commander.

34:15.521 --> 34:19.356
Boss, last to sign in
was a henry newbolt.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.223
Match it up.

34:21.592 --> 34:23.527
Tony:
Newbolt.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.595
Doesn't appear
in the ship's records.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.633
"how will ye know
him among the rest?

34:29.635 --> 34:32.202
"by the glint of stars
that cover his breast.

34:32.204 --> 34:33.437
Ye may find
admiral death."

34:33.439 --> 34:34.604
Boss, henry newbolt

34:34.606 --> 34:35.739
Is a turn-of-the-century
british poet.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.507
He's one of
my father's favorites.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.777
Why would the admiral need
to conceal his identity?

34:40.779 --> 34:43.680
Bring him in.
Boss, please, no.

34:43.682 --> 34:44.648
Yes. Go.

34:44.650 --> 34:45.682
Boss, there's
no reason

34:45.684 --> 34:46.817
To think that he
would do this.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.318
Mcgee, your dad
has spent his life

34:48.320 --> 34:49.519
Talking his way out of things.

34:49.521 --> 34:52.155
This is about answers--
real answers.

34:52.157 --> 34:54.724
And that could just as easy
prove him innocent.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.296
Admiral mcgee: <i>You really want</i>
<i>to do this, agent gibbs?</i>

34:59.298 --> 35:01.198
I think we're already
doing it, admiral.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.732
I've got an appointment
I can't be late for.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.568
Then I'll try to
make it quick.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.503
I'm waiting.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.637
Where were you
when commander brian...

35:07.639 --> 35:08.805
With my staff.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.307
From the moment
that helo landed

35:10.309 --> 35:11.675
To when I stepped off
the <i>borealis.</i>

35:11.677 --> 35:14.311
Captain vandevere also knew
my whereabouts at all times.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.147
Are we done?
You used a phony name
to see the doctor.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.549
Like I said, you have
a question, ask it.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.685
I just did.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.187
Who's behind the glass?

35:25.823 --> 35:27.824
Who's watching?

35:29.160 --> 35:31.328
You scared he's gonna
see you break?

35:31.330 --> 35:34.731
My relationship with my son
is none of your damn business.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.800
You make him think
he's nothing.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.769
You're the one with nothing.

35:39.771 --> 35:43.306
You will respect this uniform.

35:43.308 --> 35:44.641
Answer the question.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.676
This uniform provided
for him, for his mother,

35:46.678 --> 35:47.744
For this whole family.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.880
Why lie? Why
avoid the truth?

35:49.882 --> 35:51.548
Why avoid your son?

35:55.286 --> 35:57.354
All right.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.692
Because I'm sick.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.630
No one could know.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.698
Stage four.

36:11.269 --> 36:13.236
(sighs)

36:15.173 --> 36:19.543
I wasn't feeling well when we...
Showed up for the exercises.

36:21.779 --> 36:25.782
I knew haber was top-notch, so
I transferred to the <i>borealis.</i>

36:25.784 --> 36:29.419
Haber gave me something
for the pain,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.521
But he knew
what was causing it.

36:33.457 --> 36:35.492
He was gonna
report it to navcent.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.763
Doctor-patient privilege
is a little different

36:39.765 --> 36:41.765
When it comes
to national security.

36:41.767 --> 36:45.268
So that meant
the end of my career.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.437
It's motive
to keep the commander quiet.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.506
Gibbs...

36:49.508 --> 36:51.975
I've been a lot of things.

36:51.977 --> 36:56.213
I've been a lousy father,
I've been a son of a bitch.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.982
But I'm no murderer.

37:13.831 --> 37:16.499
Vance: <i>That's a hell</i>
<i>of a way to find out.</i>

37:16.501 --> 37:19.269
So who, beside the admiral,

37:19.271 --> 37:20.604
Stood to lose

37:20.606 --> 37:21.871
If the illness went public?

37:21.873 --> 37:24.441
The admiral did not even tell
his own son,

37:24.443 --> 37:27.510
So whoever knew had to be
someone extremely close.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.778
Who could even get that close?

37:28.780 --> 37:30.313
Someone who doesn't
have a choice.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.649
Dinozzo, run
the admiral's aide,

37:32.651 --> 37:34.584
Lieutenant carlton mane.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.719
On it, boss.

37:35.721 --> 37:36.853
Agent dinozzo?

37:38.856 --> 37:39.723
Where are you going?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.325
Squad room, sir.

37:42.327 --> 37:43.560
Hmm.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.562
(clears throat)

37:45.564 --> 37:47.530
Your computer?

37:48.532 --> 37:49.966
Your desk?

37:49.968 --> 37:51.334
Thank you.

37:51.336 --> 37:54.738
I-I just used
hand sanitizer, so...

37:54.740 --> 37:56.339
It's a comfortable chair.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.841
It gets less comfortable
over time.

37:57.843 --> 37:58.808
(sighs)

37:58.810 --> 38:00.577
This is nice.

38:00.579 --> 38:01.811
Hey.

38:02.613 --> 38:03.780
Dinozzo.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.848
Got his service record.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.416
Put it up on the plasma.

38:08.386 --> 38:11.054
Well, he graduated high
in his class at annapolis.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.690
Former intel officer
working black ops.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.724
This is interesting.

38:14.726 --> 38:15.925
Letter in his file

38:15.927 --> 38:18.762
Talks about
lieutenant mane being

38:18.764 --> 38:20.797
An integral part
of his team.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.299
And requests
his reassignment

38:22.301 --> 38:24.601
To the admiral's staff
upon his acceptance

38:24.603 --> 38:26.736
Of a cabinet-level post.

38:26.738 --> 38:30.006
So if the admiral doesn't go
to the white house, then...

38:30.008 --> 38:31.775
Mane doesn't either.
Mm.

38:31.777 --> 38:34.911
Dinozzo, link the ten-grand
payoff to the lieutenant.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.012
You think mane

38:36.014 --> 38:37.781
Paid graves to steal the tablet?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.516
Graves was just
following orders.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.685
Then mane tossed
it to the trash.

38:44.855 --> 38:47.691
We'll finish the walk-through
aboard the <i>knox,</i>

38:47.693 --> 38:49.426
Then break for lunch
in the officers' mess.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.860
The admiral will meet us there.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.796
Does that work for everyone?
Doesn't work
for me, mane.

38:52.798 --> 38:55.031
We got a lot of things
to talk about.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.466
Make an appointment,
special agent gibbs.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.101
We'll be happy to get
something on the books.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.004
He doesn't need an appointment,
lieutenant.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.007
Dismissed.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.911
What he has to say
is worth listening to.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.115
Is there a problem, admiral?

39:12.117 --> 39:14.918
We weren't expecting you on base
for another two hours.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.486
I have questions, carlton.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.921
I expect straight answers.

39:19.590 --> 39:20.857
How long have you worked
with me?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.959
A long time, sir.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.894
We treated you well?

39:24.896 --> 39:26.896
Like family.

39:28.933 --> 39:30.834
It's not easy being
a member of this family.

39:30.836 --> 39:34.738
I expect the
absolute best.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.540
Honesty, integrity, loyalty

39:37.542 --> 39:39.576
In everything we do.

39:39.578 --> 39:41.010
Yes, sir.
So where were
those traits

39:41.012 --> 39:42.645
When you murdered
commander haber?

39:52.890 --> 39:55.992
I was only ever thinking
about you, admiral.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.895
I had to do something.
I had to keep him quiet!

40:00.097 --> 40:01.765
This was my decision.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.433
My responsibility.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.503
You taught me that commitment
to success comes first.

40:09.673 --> 40:11.741
I was wrong.

40:32.496 --> 40:35.498
So... What did you decide?

40:37.701 --> 40:39.869
Nothing yet.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.205
I don't even know
what kind of cancer he has,

40:42.207 --> 40:44.541
Or how long the doctors
are giving him.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.577
Guess maybe, best thing
I could do is... Is call him

40:47.579 --> 40:49.979
And try to get him
to talk to me.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.548
Mcgee, I was talking
about the kid.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.216
Oh, adam.

40:53.218 --> 40:56.186
Yeah, I decided to stay on
as his big brother.

40:56.188 --> 40:59.489
I'm actually taking him
to a midnight screening of

40:59.491 --> 41:01.591
Zombie planet
from galaxy j tonight.

41:01.593 --> 41:03.593
Well, that
sounds awful.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.962
(laughs): I think
he's a lucky kid.

41:09.900 --> 41:14.103
Boss, you think I made the
right decision with my father?

41:14.105 --> 41:17.106
To be the bigger man?

41:20.878 --> 41:23.880
Maybe it's time
he learned from you, mcgee.

41:25.850 --> 41:28.151
(cell phone ringing)

41:37.127 --> 41:40.129
Just don't be late
for the movie.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.841
(elevator bell dings)

41:53.811 --> 41:55.879
Well, thanks for calling.

41:58.115 --> 42:01.518
Beautiful out, huh?
Not so cold.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.256
Do the others know?

42:06.258 --> 42:09.292
I'll talk to your sister.

42:09.294 --> 42:11.561
What about mom?

42:11.563 --> 42:14.030
I can't just call her
out of the blue.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.666
I think she'd
want you to.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.035
(sighs)

42:19.037 --> 42:21.004
Apologies are hard for me.

42:21.006 --> 42:23.106
They're hard for
everybody, dad.

42:25.075 --> 42:28.745
There are some things
I wish I'd done differently.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.113
You know, gibbs says

42:30.115 --> 42:32.615
That apologies are a sign
of weakness.

42:32.617 --> 42:35.018
I always thought you'd be one
to agree with that.

42:35.020 --> 42:39.088
Like I said,
agent gibbs is a smart man.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.791
(sighs):
Oh, tim.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.726
What can I do?

42:43.728 --> 42:46.696
You can walk with me.

42:53.037 --> 42:56.272
Your mother would like this.

42:56.274 --> 42:59.342
Yeah. I think she would.
