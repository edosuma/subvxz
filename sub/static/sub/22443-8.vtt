00:00.885 --> 00:03.262
Previously on Spotless...

00:04.026 --> 00:05.768
As of right now,

00:05.814 --> 00:07.446
I'm your lawyer.

00:07.494 --> 00:09.126
You need to protect yourself,

00:09.246 --> 00:12.264
- and the children.
- How do you get someone to like you?

00:12.323 --> 00:13.625
Well, you have to...

00:13.745 --> 00:16.198
you have to become irresistible.

00:17.998 --> 00:19.461
What the fuck?

00:19.714 --> 00:21.654
He can just walk in here?

00:22.044 --> 00:25.319
Make sure every component
is completely destroyed.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.817
Everything okay?

00:28.665 --> 00:30.157
I can help.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.887
Will you come in?

00:32.296 --> 00:33.932
This can't happen again.

00:34.013 --> 00:34.966
I don't do this.

00:36.158 --> 00:37.540
Of course not.

00:37.660 --> 00:39.603
Fuck this! I saved your life.

00:40.118 --> 00:41.462
Veysel's dead.

00:41.863 --> 00:42.830
His wife too.

00:42.950 --> 00:44.237
Nelson ordered it.

00:44.309 --> 00:45.586
After they were dead,

00:45.600 --> 00:47.810
one of them fucked the corpse of the wife.

00:48.031 --> 00:49.337
Necrophilia.

00:49.900 --> 00:50.739
What?

00:50.859 --> 00:52.984
Now, what kind of a person
does a thing like that?

00:53.536 --> 00:54.933
I'm very squeamish.

00:55.010 --> 00:57.078
I'll duck and cover if
somebody gets a splinter.

03:05.689 --> 03:06.533
Hey.

03:10.492 --> 03:11.459
You OK?

03:25.403 --> 03:26.909
Jesus, Maureen...

03:28.935 --> 03:30.289
He's still warm.

03:30.955 --> 03:34.363
It... means there's something left
if they're still warm, doesn't it?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.423
He... he... he might
still be able to hear us.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.057
It always reminded him of being a kid.

03:43.076 --> 03:45.106
I... I thought, if I played it...

03:51.875 --> 03:53.367
Sam liked to travel.

03:53.953 --> 03:55.173
He reckoned we had

03:55.731 --> 03:59.676
an obligation to experience as
many people and places as possible.

04:02.245 --> 04:03.284
What was his favorite?

04:03.703 --> 04:05.224
Don't think he found it.

04:05.543 --> 04:07.592
He was putting money away to

04:08.055 --> 04:09.790
travel to South America.

04:10.130 --> 04:11.767
Down through Chili

04:11.844 --> 04:13.331
to the southern tip.

04:14.723 --> 04:15.643
What changed?

04:16.305 --> 04:18.083
Early onset Parkinson's.

04:18.408 --> 04:21.058
It's just over a year
since we got the diagnosis.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.641
He couldn't face it.

04:23.356 --> 04:24.520
He could face it.

04:24.529 --> 04:26.040
Strong as a bow, Sam.

04:28.972 --> 04:30.959
He just didn't want to put me through it.

04:32.613 --> 04:34.282
Didn't want to burden me.

04:36.341 --> 04:38.229
I'd have been with him,

04:38.305 --> 04:39.821
hell and high water.

04:40.797 --> 04:42.737
Sickness and health.

04:44.019 --> 04:45.577
We were joined.

04:48.152 --> 04:49.382
I'm offended

04:49.760 --> 04:52.227
he thought I could see him as a burden.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.630
Now that's how everyone will remember him.

04:55.649 --> 04:56.745
"Sam Devine,

04:56.788 --> 04:59.010
Maureen's fella, the
one who topped himself. "

05:04.200 --> 05:05.554
We should call it in.

05:10.087 --> 05:11.354
There'll be cops

05:11.860 --> 05:12.937
and a medic.

05:13.130 --> 05:15.029
None of the good stuff.

05:17.236 --> 05:18.532
Nothing he did.

05:20.519 --> 05:22.092
Just hung himself.

05:23.040 --> 05:26.146
Emergency Services. Which
service can I connect you with?

05:26.834 --> 05:27.749
Hello?

05:30.652 --> 05:31.568
Hello?

05:31.620 --> 05:32.692
Can I help you?

05:32.916 --> 05:34.595
I'm sorry, everything's fine.

05:39.685 --> 05:41.864
He doesn't have to be remembered that way.

05:46.248 --> 05:47.611
I can change it.

05:50.380 --> 05:51.291
Be busy.

05:51.315 --> 05:53.640
Do a stock take, call suppliers.

05:56.134 --> 05:57.216
How long?

05:57.697 --> 05:59.023
A few hours.

05:59.509 --> 06:02.121
I'll give you a call from
a call box once I've left.

06:02.856 --> 06:04.195
You can come home and

06:04.447 --> 06:05.615
discover him.

06:10.058 --> 06:11.025
Thank you.

07:30.552 --> 07:33.145
You might have at least
bought me dinner first.

07:33.207 --> 07:34.866
You don't get to make jokes.

07:37.807 --> 07:39.809
You broke Maureen's heart today.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.304
Not that you're judging.

07:49.308 --> 07:50.757
Should you be doing that in here?

07:51.691 --> 07:53.702
It's not a riddle, mate, I'm dead.

07:56.314 --> 07:58.359
You've really crossed the line, don't you?

07:59.073 --> 08:01.523
No one has a gun to your head this time.

08:01.528 --> 08:03.228
No one's forcing you.

08:04.739 --> 08:05.821
Boo hoo.

08:06.002 --> 08:07.961
"Nelson made me do it. "

08:08.890 --> 08:09.867
Not this time.

08:10.311 --> 08:11.579
This is different.

08:11.945 --> 08:12.961
It's personal.

08:14.495 --> 08:15.944
They all say that.

08:16.201 --> 08:17.520
Al Capone.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.966
Charlie Manson.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.945
Maureen would have cared for you.

08:21.846 --> 08:23.090
Nursed you.

08:24.010 --> 08:25.192
You know that, right?

08:25.559 --> 08:26.703
I know.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.538
Then why did you do it?

08:31.694 --> 08:32.799
You're selfish.

08:33.414 --> 08:35.688
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

08:39.405 --> 08:42.227
Have you told Julie how
much danger she's in?

08:46.536 --> 08:48.905
Not so talkative now, are you?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.104
No.

08:53.733 --> 08:56.545
I don't want a murderer's
breath in my body.

08:56.550 --> 08:57.720
I'm not a murderer.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.853
We both know that isn't true.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.782
I need to reopen your lungs.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.626
Have you earned the right to play God?

09:29.025 --> 09:31.375
This is the best that you can do?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.435
Fell asleep and drowned?

09:35.454 --> 09:37.120
Domestic accident.

09:37.318 --> 09:38.648
Could happen to anyone.

09:38.834 --> 09:40.030
Even so.

09:42.100 --> 09:44.803
You got petechial hemorrhages
around your eyes and neck,

09:45.040 --> 09:47.190
they'll lead the coroner
in the right direction.

09:47.236 --> 09:48.094
Still.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.402
It's not much of a death, is it?

09:53.847 --> 09:55.286
It's not for you.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.190
- It's for Maureen.
- Emotional blackmail

10:01.310 --> 10:03.414
is a cunt's trick.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.928
I'm gonna drown you now, Sam.

10:05.986 --> 10:08.171
Is this what you did with Capoue?

10:09.205 --> 10:11.025
When you put him in the water?

10:13.841 --> 10:15.175
Not exactly.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.965
Why didn't you give Capoue a warning

10:42.085 --> 10:43.531
before you hit him?

10:44.814 --> 10:46.390
- What?
- "Stop!"

10:46.744 --> 10:48.590
"Leave him alone!"

10:49.419 --> 10:53.239
You said nothing. Just put
an axe in his fucking head.

10:53.794 --> 10:55.621
It was just... instinct.

11:04.981 --> 11:07.299
You little murderer.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.750
Everything that has happened

11:10.784 --> 11:13.500
between that day and this,

11:14.072 --> 11:16.019
is all because of you.

11:16.389 --> 11:17.701
Shut up.

11:58.886 --> 11:59.944
Hey.

12:01.325 --> 12:02.556
What's wrong?

12:03.295 --> 12:04.734
It's not you.

12:06.468 --> 12:10.098
- I made vows.
- You and I have nothing to do with your husband.

12:11.294 --> 12:13.374
You don't understand the
kind of damage this could do.

12:13.391 --> 12:15.038
Oh I understand damage.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.858
I am that kind of damage.

12:22.805 --> 12:24.001
Tell me.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.976
When I was 12 years old,

12:27.444 --> 12:29.704
I saw my mother fucking another man.

12:59.635 --> 13:01.109
Stop. Calm down!

13:01.686 --> 13:03.062
Stop! Listen,

13:03.096 --> 13:04.819
you're a big boy now.
You know what's going on.

13:04.858 --> 13:07.372
- Your mom was sad.
- You fucked her!

13:07.492 --> 13:09.134
I was making her happy, you get it?

13:09.192 --> 13:10.609
My dad will kill you.

13:10.610 --> 13:13.110
Your mom came to me
because your dad's a pussy.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.562
Your brother killed him.

13:33.851 --> 13:35.458
No, we killed him.

13:39.584 --> 13:41.320
We hid the body together.

13:43.213 --> 13:44.720
It fucked us up.

13:54.782 --> 13:55.887
Maybe,

13:56.007 --> 13:58.680
you saw killing Capoue as an opportunity.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.080
To do what?

14:00.133 --> 14:01.711
To be special.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.785
Because you are special,

14:03.814 --> 14:05.068
aren't ya?

14:08.911 --> 14:11.332
I hope they still have time to enjoy it.

14:12.673 --> 14:14.106
Your family.

14:14.530 --> 14:16.077
It won't be long

14:16.570 --> 14:18.990
before Nelson makes his move,

14:19.110 --> 14:20.232
will it?

14:20.411 --> 14:21.752
Unless...

14:25.491 --> 14:27.600
you make your move first.

15:53.696 --> 15:55.933
I woke you up. I'm sorry.

16:00.434 --> 16:02.676
Maureen's husband died last night.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.242
Sam?

16:07.114 --> 16:08.894
God, poor Maureen!

16:12.494 --> 16:13.696
What happened?

16:15.302 --> 16:17.828
He fell asleep in the bath.

16:18.902 --> 16:20.040
Drowned.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.000
Oh my God.

16:25.623 --> 16:28.148
They didn't even get the
chance to say goodbye.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.206
Then maybe it's better that way.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.274
An automatic?

16:57.574 --> 16:59.094
Well, it's been a while.

16:59.805 --> 17:01.839
It's in case he decides to run on you.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.700
You should let me do this.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.878
- Would you use an automatic?
- Maybe.

17:08.849 --> 17:10.282
At least, let me come with you.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.589
You stay away.

17:21.714 --> 17:23.256
There's coffee on the pot.

17:25.983 --> 17:27.573
You were late last night.

17:30.186 --> 17:31.359
I'm sorry.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.280
Did I disturb you?

17:36.087 --> 17:38.832
You know I can't sleep
when you're not here.

17:46.373 --> 17:48.158
Why don't we do something today?

17:49.551 --> 17:50.782
Just us two.

17:51.498 --> 17:53.280
I would love to.

17:53.920 --> 17:54.943
But I can't.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.360
So she bought 200 cigarettes

18:06.567 --> 18:09.629
and she made her smoke the
entire lot. She got sick

18:09.630 --> 18:11.289
and she never smoked again.

18:11.409 --> 18:12.800
That's disgusting.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.074
Well, that's life.

18:14.138 --> 18:16.091
All the best lessons are disgusting.

18:17.119 --> 18:19.367
Try to barricade yourself in your room now?

18:19.581 --> 18:21.320
It's to keep the bad men out.

18:21.759 --> 18:23.747
Try keeping the bad kid in.

18:24.389 --> 18:27.035
At least I don't go 'round
calling myself Casey.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.872
- Who's Casey?
- It's her avatar.

18:29.890 --> 18:32.600
- On her laptop.
- For fuck's sake, can't I have any privacy?

18:32.619 --> 18:34.486
Hey, language please!

18:36.080 --> 18:36.800
What?

18:38.471 --> 18:40.307
Do I say any bad words in front of you?

18:41.014 --> 18:41.920
All the time.

18:42.679 --> 18:44.454
Right. Let's get you to school.

18:46.101 --> 18:49.683
Maybe I can, teach your sister
some new bad words on the way.

18:49.993 --> 18:51.010
Come on, shitbag.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.123
I thought I'd...

18:56.178 --> 18:57.690
I'd take Maureen some flowers.

18:59.613 --> 19:00.565
Good.

19:05.931 --> 19:08.853
Come to the Royal Oak. Now.

19:11.054 --> 19:12.191
Is something wrong?

19:27.304 --> 19:28.478
Everything's OK.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.210
OK, buddy.

19:53.765 --> 19:55.591
You go and play with
your friends, all right?

19:56.600 --> 19:58.250
He doesn't have any friends.

20:00.159 --> 20:01.292
Well, you're his friend.

20:01.371 --> 20:02.990
You take care of each other, don't you.

20:05.361 --> 20:07.321
- Maddy.
- Don't touch me.

20:27.673 --> 20:28.926
- Hello?
- Julie?

20:28.958 --> 20:30.752
Michael Hillier, we were supposed to meet.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.560
Michael. Fuck... um...

20:33.080 --> 20:35.112
Listen, I'm really sorry,
something's come up.

20:35.116 --> 20:36.440
Well, nothing serious I hope.

20:36.632 --> 20:38.569
No, it's family stuff, um...

20:39.640 --> 20:41.121
Listen, let me make it up to you.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.736
- No, no, no. That's not necessary.
- You're an important client.

20:44.783 --> 20:46.317
Why don't you let me
take you out for lunch,

20:46.331 --> 20:48.161
and you can sign off on the designs.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.427
We could meet at yours. I'm in the area.

20:50.585 --> 20:53.178
Oh, I don't usually do business
from home, with the kids...

20:54.329 --> 20:55.378
Yeah, of course.

20:56.118 --> 20:58.355
- Not a problem.
- Actually...

20:58.670 --> 20:59.969
Yeah, sure.

21:00.089 --> 21:01.568
Why not. How about...

21:02.119 --> 21:03.575
1:00 at my place?

21:05.188 --> 21:06.330
I'll see you there.

21:14.670 --> 21:15.664
Hi.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.812
I was gonna call you.

21:35.982 --> 21:37.701
Well, I called you first.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.214
I need your help.

21:41.607 --> 21:43.479
Don't worry, it's not a job.

21:45.466 --> 21:46.900
I made a decision.

21:48.236 --> 21:49.711
This has to end.

21:57.589 --> 21:59.859
I've come to the same conclusion.

22:03.261 --> 22:04.999
You're coming with me today.

22:05.508 --> 22:07.126
One last hurrah.

22:08.814 --> 22:11.347
I'm cooking for people. I
don't often get the chance.

22:12.157 --> 22:14.750
I like to collect my own ingredients.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.797
Unless you think that's too... phone of me?

22:20.917 --> 22:21.730
Of course not.

22:26.150 --> 22:27.360
Call Julie.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.348
Tell her to cancel her plans.

22:29.385 --> 22:30.703
Come to dinner tonight.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.530
Call her now, if you like.

22:37.343 --> 22:38.080
No.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.649
It's better this way.

22:55.480 --> 22:57.013
I'm angry at him.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.238
It was an accident.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.232
I can't remember the last
time I told Sam I loved him.

23:11.820 --> 23:13.401
Well he knows you love him.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.823
In the afterlife?

23:18.297 --> 23:20.424
He was a bit of a card carrying atheist.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.959
He didn't believe in any of that.

23:24.973 --> 23:28.370
Don't you waste what you have
with Jean. Not one second of it.

23:30.636 --> 23:31.704
I won't.

23:35.911 --> 23:37.464
I know everything now.

23:38.884 --> 23:40.585
All his secrets.

23:42.758 --> 23:44.154
I still love him.

23:46.406 --> 23:48.755
All of it's out in the
open now, and I don't care.

23:48.982 --> 23:52.040
- Oh God, sorry, I'm so tactless.
- No, it's...

23:53.035 --> 23:56.160
I'm glad some good's come of it for him.

23:56.728 --> 23:59.163
He was mad messing around with that girl,

23:59.283 --> 24:01.164
when he had you. Why risk it?

24:01.284 --> 24:03.469
For the sake of a distraction?

24:07.672 --> 24:10.660
You two have got a real chance.

24:48.096 --> 24:49.767
This won't take long.

26:15.276 --> 26:16.744
I completely forgot.

26:16.790 --> 26:18.726
- This a bad time?
- No.

26:19.159 --> 26:20.870
No, please.

26:28.071 --> 26:30.192
How soon before you can start making these?

26:30.429 --> 26:33.399
- Well, you're my priority, so...
- Oh, I'm flattered.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.560
To be your priority.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.525
It'll take three weeks.

26:41.536 --> 26:42.432
Shit!

26:44.200 --> 26:46.476
Sorry. I'm so so bloody disorganized.

26:46.494 --> 26:48.799
- I should have had all this ready...
- Stop. Hey.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.913
Change of plan.

26:53.444 --> 26:54.386
Sit down.

26:54.737 --> 26:56.800
I'm supposed to be making you lunch.

26:58.080 --> 26:59.059
Sit.

27:10.880 --> 27:11.885
Do you want to talk about it?

27:12.382 --> 27:13.752
Do you mind if we don't?

27:14.041 --> 27:15.110
Of course not.

27:47.657 --> 27:51.644
"Can I see you today?"

28:12.816 --> 28:16.035
"Sorry. I'm away for a
few days. See you soon. "

28:22.760 --> 28:24.084
See this earth works?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.633
Queen Boudicca's hill fort.

28:26.119 --> 28:29.124
She could see death
coming from any direction.

28:33.793 --> 28:36.764
Two centuries ago, they
stopped cutting the trees back.

28:38.486 --> 28:40.630
So now the branches are so heavy

28:41.382 --> 28:43.168
the trunks can't take their weight,

28:43.734 --> 28:45.358
they snap.

28:50.801 --> 28:53.269
A lot of death in the forest.

29:05.502 --> 29:06.647
Eat it.

29:22.005 --> 29:23.248
You strip that one.

29:24.924 --> 29:26.369
I'll find another.

30:07.424 --> 30:09.447
You're making me feel guilty here.

30:10.331 --> 30:11.828
What do you have to be guilty about?

30:11.829 --> 30:13.029
A great home?

30:13.730 --> 30:15.200
Beautiful family?

30:15.220 --> 30:17.341
You can tell what a happy place this is.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.779
Well, I'm supposed to be making up
for letting you down this morning.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.160
You have.

30:23.143 --> 30:24.560
You reminded me

30:24.800 --> 30:26.899
of the joys of domestic life.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.680
That's 'cause you're a tourist.

30:29.551 --> 30:30.696
Maybe.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.386
Oh my God.

30:40.721 --> 30:42.720
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

30:42.761 --> 30:44.881
- Actually don't know what I was thinking. It's been a...
- Julie, it's fine.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.846
- It's fine.
- ... horrible day.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.600
Yeah, it's been a bad day.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.407
And these things happen.

30:53.995 --> 30:56.839
Well, I'm gonna go to the
studio. I'll make it start. Um...

30:56.959 --> 30:58.840
Let me grab my coat.

31:13.756 --> 31:15.360
You ready to leave?

32:25.778 --> 32:27.591
- I wanted to see you.
- Not now.

32:27.887 --> 32:29.029
Joey just left.

32:29.149 --> 32:31.268
- Not here!
- I just want to talk.

32:31.319 --> 32:32.626
That's all. Can we do that?

32:32.822 --> 32:34.967
I don't know. Can we?

32:49.007 --> 32:50.504
...give you this last chance.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.238
What car park did you leave it?

32:53.585 --> 32:55.283
Where did you leave the car?

32:59.818 --> 33:02.800
Where's the fucking car?

33:05.260 --> 33:08.060
Yo, don't look at your
girlfriend. Look at me, yeah?

33:08.180 --> 33:09.598
I am.

33:10.025 --> 33:11.628
I'm gonna remember your face.

33:12.318 --> 33:14.844
Yo, fuck this, fam. Put one in his knee, blud.

33:18.760 --> 33:19.717
Shit!

33:20.360 --> 33:21.600
How do you turn it on?

33:21.624 --> 33:23.080
For fuck's sake, give it here!

33:23.098 --> 33:25.251
- Which chop shop do you use?
- What?

33:25.459 --> 33:28.898
For the motors you forage.
Is it the one in Ilford?

33:30.119 --> 33:31.245
No?

33:31.365 --> 33:33.881
Well, around here that
only leaves the garage up

33:33.916 --> 33:35.745
in Westhill Way, doesn't it?

33:35.760 --> 33:37.175
Stevie's place.

33:37.430 --> 33:39.094
- You know Stevie?
- Stevie knows me.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.400
Who the fuck are you, blud?

33:40.417 --> 33:43.359
Look, just tell us where the
motor is, no one gets hurt.

33:43.393 --> 33:44.670
- No.
- Why not?

33:45.034 --> 33:47.000
I don't negotiate with dead men.

33:47.039 --> 33:48.640
Dead... dead men?

33:51.310 --> 33:53.200
Yo, tonk this twat, will you fam?

33:54.650 --> 33:57.280
- Stop!
- What? You want some as well, uh?

33:57.846 --> 33:58.932
Yeah, that's what I thought.

34:02.105 --> 34:03.717
I suggest...

34:04.561 --> 34:06.323
you take a look in my wallet.

34:18.972 --> 34:20.239
That's Nelson Clay.

34:20.277 --> 34:21.683
Fuck off, man, that ain't Nelson.

34:21.706 --> 34:23.360
We've gotta go, man. Now!

34:23.480 --> 34:26.808
Untie me, and I will only take
revenge out on your friend here.

34:26.820 --> 34:28.107
Don't listen to him, fam.

34:29.079 --> 34:30.592
I won't repeat the offer.

34:31.114 --> 34:32.946
Oy! What you doin'? Oy! Listen.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.487
- We finish him off.
- Fuck that!

34:35.489 --> 34:36.713
Think about it blud, we'll be legends!

34:36.714 --> 34:37.911
Dead fucking legends!

34:37.925 --> 34:39.474
What d'you think they'll
do to our families, eh?

34:39.484 --> 34:41.402
Oh, you've got families!

34:43.556 --> 34:44.485
- Fuck it!
- Hey!

34:44.560 --> 34:45.659
Get back here, blud!

34:45.679 --> 34:47.449
Don't know where you are, do you, son?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
- You shut up. Please.
- You wandered into Narnia.

34:49.853 --> 34:50.670
Shut up!

34:50.791 --> 34:52.440
And found Aslan.

34:52.451 --> 34:53.552
Who's Aslan?

34:55.940 --> 34:57.249
It's in a book.

34:57.840 --> 35:00.339
Point is, you kill me and
I will rise up stronger.

35:00.371 --> 35:02.263
And I will eat you alive.

35:48.887 --> 35:54.680
# Last night I dreamed #

35:56.639 --> 36:01.789
# of holding you tight #

36:04.286 --> 36:10.112
# it was a lovely dream #

36:12.232 --> 36:17.618
# of holding you tight #

36:19.551 --> 36:25.019
# I know our love #

36:27.063 --> 36:32.820
# will always be #

36:34.972 --> 36:37.644
# we'll be as #

36:37.702 --> 36:42.812
# free my love as the birds in the tree #

36:58.712 --> 37:00.670
Nelson would kill us both.

37:00.713 --> 37:02.252
If he knew about this.

37:03.025 --> 37:04.108
No.

37:04.773 --> 37:06.131
Just you.

37:11.434 --> 37:12.574
Do you love him?

37:17.521 --> 37:19.014
Yes, I do.

37:21.811 --> 37:24.183
I knew Nelson before I met him.

37:24.613 --> 37:25.718
I knew of him.

37:26.694 --> 37:29.333
For years, I just though
he was some sort of monster.

37:30.309 --> 37:31.520
I hated him.

37:33.266 --> 37:34.367
And then,

37:35.158 --> 37:36.290
when he turned up,

37:36.410 --> 37:38.505
at the hospice with his wife, Maggie...

37:40.641 --> 37:43.345
I realized he was just another
man with a broken heart.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.790
Everybody cries around death.

37:50.701 --> 37:51.885
It doesn't make you good.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.005
Nelson's not good.

37:57.344 --> 37:58.533
Neither am I.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.866
I was gonna put you there.

39:56.735 --> 39:58.140
Beautiful little spot,

39:58.163 --> 39:59.851
next to Bill Joslin's wife.

40:01.672 --> 40:03.100
You killed her too?

40:04.687 --> 40:07.382
I don't let anyone else kill my friends.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.698
- We're not friends.
- Tom Dolan said that

40:09.818 --> 40:11.945
just before I put three bullets in him.

40:14.349 --> 40:16.776
You knew exactly what was
gonna happen, didn't you?

40:17.784 --> 40:18.542
Uh?

40:18.843 --> 40:20.132
I pulled a gun

40:20.641 --> 40:21.866
you didn't turn.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.070
Why?

40:27.030 --> 40:28.722
Maybe I'd accepted it.

40:29.406 --> 40:30.940
Nobody accepts it.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.730
Human nature makes us fight for survival.

40:37.677 --> 40:38.801
Look at you,

40:38.990 --> 40:42.041
trying to free yourself from a
tow-rope that could pull a truck.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.752
I'm not trying to get free,

40:44.432 --> 40:45.925
I'm trying to get my phone.

40:58.571 --> 40:59.394
Hey.

41:00.410 --> 41:01.538
Where is everyone?

41:01.945 --> 41:03.882
This house is like the Mary Celeste.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.026
You need to come pick me up.

41:06.466 --> 41:07.506
Why? What happened?

41:07.829 --> 41:08.772
Please.

41:20.889 --> 41:23.034
I can think of worse places to die.

41:23.237 --> 41:24.458
We're not gonna die.

41:24.647 --> 41:25.747
This time of year?

41:25.760 --> 41:28.590
Hypothermia could find
us before your brother.

41:29.742 --> 41:32.386
- I'm not afraid of death.
- Oh, I've known that for a while.

41:34.439 --> 41:36.232
Most people would have been terrified

41:36.251 --> 41:38.818
by what's befallen you over
these last couple of months.

41:39.913 --> 41:41.080
But not you.

41:42.577 --> 41:45.351
Why are you and death on such good terms?

41:45.647 --> 41:47.977
Been working with it for the past 15 years.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.237
I think it's been with you much longer.

41:54.295 --> 41:56.121
I've killed my first man

41:57.282 --> 41:58.710
at 17.

42:01.433 --> 42:04.007
When you see someone
die for the first time,

42:05.103 --> 42:07.654
you realize this world is all there is.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.174
And life is...

42:15.787 --> 42:17.220
just ends.

42:19.176 --> 42:20.993
Without giving any answers.

42:38.191 --> 42:39.675
Do you know who she is?

42:40.636 --> 42:41.677
Well, don't worry.

42:41.885 --> 42:43.215
This is good for us.

42:43.294 --> 42:44.344
How can it be good?

42:45.080 --> 42:46.877
My husband is fucking another woman!

42:46.900 --> 42:48.255
Which just provides you

42:48.375 --> 42:51.480
- with further ammunition.
- What are you talking about?

42:51.650 --> 42:53.347
- What are you doing here?
- Go back to bed, gorgeous.

42:54.872 --> 42:55.718
Is it Dad?

42:55.981 --> 42:57.230
Will you listen to your aunt, please?

42:57.253 --> 42:59.342
- I wanted a drink of water.
- Now!

43:05.274 --> 43:06.777
It's time to get Jean

43:07.013 --> 43:08.132
out of your life.

43:09.214 --> 43:10.661
I don't think I'm ready.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.141
Nelson gave you a key?

43:37.372 --> 43:38.505
He isn't here.

43:39.760 --> 43:40.812
It's all right.

43:46.046 --> 43:47.567
I thought we should talk.

43:51.967 --> 43:53.488
Recognize this?

44:23.520 --> 44:24.640
Where the fuck are you?

44:24.760 --> 44:26.161
We're...

44:29.800 --> 44:32.028
What? Did you not leave
a trail of bread crumbs?

44:33.623 --> 44:34.705
Just, uh...

44:35.560 --> 44:37.480
Follow the path for 10 minutes.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.785
- You'll get to, uh, a landmark.
- What kind of landmark?

44:41.432 --> 44:42.828
Kind of hill fort.

44:43.239 --> 44:44.677
Call me when you get there.

45:12.557 --> 45:13.870
OK, 10 minutes.

45:14.147 --> 45:15.169
What now?

45:15.289 --> 45:17.720
- Can you see the fort?
- There is no fort.

45:17.960 --> 45:19.935
No, it... it doesn't look like a fort.

45:19.954 --> 45:21.320
It's foundations.

45:21.359 --> 45:23.148
Earth and, ah, trees.

45:23.166 --> 45:24.669
I'm in a fucking forest,

45:24.696 --> 45:26.777
there's a lot of earth and trees.

45:28.390 --> 45:30.096
Try to look for, uh...

45:30.520 --> 45:31.600
Fuck!

45:31.816 --> 45:32.708
Hello?

45:33.591 --> 45:34.590
Fuck!

45:39.754 --> 45:40.660
Jean?

45:43.702 --> 45:44.914
Jean?

46:02.904 --> 46:04.360
Casey?

46:05.450 --> 46:08.610
- Steven.
- You look nothing like your photo.

46:08.793 --> 46:10.018
You lied to me.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.289
You're not exactly Snow White yourself.

46:13.006 --> 46:14.942
Don't take the fucking high ground with me.

46:15.629 --> 46:18.530
- I have to go.
- What? Is it past your bedtime?

46:19.744 --> 46:21.495
We can get a drink, or...

46:32.985 --> 46:35.175
No disrespect or nothing Blondie, but

46:35.215 --> 46:38.053
you might be the poshest
girl I've ever fucking seen.

46:38.440 --> 46:40.139
Let alone shared a drink with.

46:41.127 --> 46:42.595
You're kinda slummin' it.

46:42.715 --> 46:44.068
There's a whole word out there

46:44.080 --> 46:46.582
and I'm locked away in a
very fancy padded cell.

46:47.206 --> 46:48.796
Poor little princess, eh?

46:49.998 --> 46:51.080
Or not.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.673
I'm easy either way.

46:55.262 --> 46:56.580
Sorry if I'm rude.

46:56.759 --> 46:59.019
Where I come from, you
get your defenses in first.

46:59.040 --> 47:01.387
I don't care where you
come from, or I come from.

47:01.507 --> 47:03.537
It's all bogus. People hide behind it.

47:03.560 --> 47:04.948
Where's the blue?

47:09.692 --> 47:11.241
Give that back.

47:12.403 --> 47:14.113
I can sell it for you.

47:14.477 --> 47:15.778
Good money.

47:42.492 --> 47:45.280
Have you decided who's coming with me yet?

47:47.502 --> 47:48.670
Him?

47:52.367 --> 47:53.569
Or you?

47:55.320 --> 47:58.680
I'm not going to leave my
family, like you did with Maureen.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.029
So, him.

48:02.214 --> 48:03.920
I'm not a killer.

48:04.675 --> 48:07.334
Did you break Julie's heart, Jean?

48:10.928 --> 48:12.373
Maybe

48:13.395 --> 48:15.227
you should set her free.

49:27.452 --> 49:28.649
Jean!

49:32.907 --> 49:34.161
Jean!

49:36.964 --> 49:38.091
Jean!

49:42.379 --> 49:43.442
Jean!

49:43.639 --> 49:44.910
Martin!

49:46.164 --> 49:47.418
Over here!

50:00.536 --> 50:01.628
You OK?

50:01.686 --> 50:02.836
Yeah.

50:07.667 --> 50:08.956
What happened here?

50:13.585 --> 50:14.701
You.

50:15.388 --> 50:17.203
You were going to kill my brother, uh?

50:17.659 --> 50:19.122
Martin! Hey, hey, hey!

50:19.242 --> 50:20.595
What the fuck are you doin'?

50:21.063 --> 50:23.449
If we kill him now, our problems are over.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.251
- No. Joey? Victor?
- Fuck them! Let's do it!

50:36.001 --> 50:37.058
Give me the gun.

50:55.601 --> 50:57.051
Does that feel good?

50:58.929 --> 51:00.276
Hmm? Power?

51:05.480 --> 51:06.823
What should I do?

51:09.192 --> 51:11.474
Your choices are your own, Jean.

51:39.698 --> 51:41.241
I'm letting you live.

52:40.669 --> 52:42.368
Letting me live,

52:43.171 --> 52:44.910
that was a weak thing to do.

52:47.153 --> 52:48.592
Where have you been?

52:49.210 --> 52:51.059
- What happened?
- Nothing.

52:53.041 --> 52:55.294
We'll speak soon, gentlemen.

52:58.172 --> 52:59.738
Victor knows.

53:34.288 --> 53:35.866
Can I have one of those?

53:40.304 --> 53:41.853
Someone hit you on the head?

53:44.428 --> 53:45.628
Yeah.

53:47.770 --> 53:48.827
Won't ask.

53:57.929 --> 53:59.397
He knew, Maureen.

53:59.957 --> 54:00.957
Sam.

54:01.535 --> 54:03.638
He knew you would never
see him as a burden.

54:05.823 --> 54:07.719
He just didn't want to be helpless.

54:09.463 --> 54:10.861
Sounds like him.

54:23.308 --> 54:24.741
What a day.

54:30.549 --> 54:32.161
It's gonna get tougher.

54:35.524 --> 54:36.726
I'm cool with that.
