WEBVTT

03:01.639 --> 03:02.639
Come on!

03:57.153 --> 03:58.153
Are you okay?

03:58.446 --> 03:59.447
Ma'am, are you okay?

03:59.822 --> 04:01.824
- What happened?
- Call an ambulance.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.534
Call an ambulance!

04:03.993 --> 04:05.787
Ma'am? Oh, God.

04:05.870 --> 04:06.996
Ma'am!

04:07.664 --> 04:10.083
Yeah, there's been a bad car accident.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.962
We're about two miles off the freeway.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.214
She's got a punctured lung.
Get her into Operating Room B.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.298
We need a tray.

04:18.298 --> 04:19.550
Get a bag over here.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.844
- What we got?
- Female, no identification.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.180
Appears to be in her late 20s,
car accident.

04:27.225 --> 04:29.686
<i>I'll love you forever and a day.</i>

04:32.063 --> 04:33.982
She's going into v-tach.
She's unstable.

04:38.152 --> 04:39.737
Tell B to have a crash cart ready.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.322
We need to start compression.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.001
Miss, can you hear me?

04:53.084 --> 04:54.084
Miss?

04:54.961 --> 04:56.254
She's unresponsive.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.841
How much longer are we waiting?

04:59.924 --> 05:00.924
Coming through.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.720
Transfer on three.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
One, two, three.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.267
I'm losing the pulse.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.352
Charge to 300 joules.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.271
- Got you.
- Clear!

05:15.189 --> 05:17.650
She's at bradycardia.
30, 90 over 50.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.860
Charge to 360.

05:18.943 --> 05:20.111
Clear!

05:30.246 --> 05:32.248
Excuse me.
I'm looking for my wife.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.792
I'm Russell Williams.
I got a call.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.544
My wife Jennifer was in a car accident.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.254
She's in the OR, sir. I'm sorry.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.215
No, you can't go in there! Mr. Williams!

05:41.466 --> 05:42.466
Call Security.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.885
Hey, Jennifer!

05:46.721 --> 05:47.721
Jennifer!

05:51.642 --> 05:53.061
Get another amp of epi.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.353
Charge again.

05:54.854 --> 05:55.854
Clear!

05:58.316 --> 05:59.525
Give me a reading.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.361
Pulse is 75, pressure's 90 over 70.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.444
She gonna be okay?

06:03.237 --> 06:04.781
Sir, you can't be here.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.990
She's stabilizing.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.451
Nice work, everyone.
Let's prep for surgery.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.911
I'm sorry, you can't be here.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.337
Excuse me.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.924
I was wondering if there's an update.

06:23.549 --> 06:24.549
Ah...

06:25.009 --> 06:26.302
she's still in surgery.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.889
Okay, did she say anything
to anyone about what happened?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.892
Mr. Williams, your wife...

06:34.102 --> 06:36.562
has had a lot of internal bleeding
on her brain...

06:36.646 --> 06:37.646
Oh, God.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.608
It's possible she won't remember anything.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.152
If anything changes, I'll let you know.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.280
- It's gonna be a while.
- Thank you.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.065
Mr. Williams,

08:03.149 --> 08:06.152
your wife's out of surgery. She hasn't
regained consciousness yet,

08:06.235 --> 08:08.779
but if you want, I'll take you
up to Recovery to see her.

08:09.238 --> 08:10.781
Alright. Thank you.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.773
Hey, Jen.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.778
It's me.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.789
I want you to know that I'm here

08:59.872 --> 09:02.333
and I'm not gonna leave,
no matter what. Okay?

09:07.338 --> 09:08.338
Do you hear me?

09:08.631 --> 09:10.007
I'm not going anywhere.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.207
- How old?
- Three.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.501
They grow up so fast, don't they?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.585
They do.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.088
- You gotta enjoy it while it lasts.
- Mm.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.716
Someone's a lucky girl.

09:51.966 --> 09:52.966
It's her birthday.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.802
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.928
Thank you.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.682
Oh, excuse me for a second.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.517
Detective Page.

10:03.936 --> 10:04.936
Yeah.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.940
I can be there in - what?
- 45.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.735
Alright. See you then.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.362
You know what?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.490
I'll take the bear as well.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.283
Okay.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.580
Look, he's getting a big bear.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.029
So they said they found Jennifer
at a rest stop?

10:55.446 --> 10:57.823
Off 33, near Brubaker Canyon.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.703
When was the last time you saw her?

11:07.124 --> 11:10.419
That night, she went out to get groceries,
said she wanted to cook dinner.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.089
You never heard anything?

11:13.214 --> 11:14.214
No, sir.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.593
No, I waited about an hour, and...

11:19.679 --> 11:22.098
I tried to call her cell phone.
She didn't answer,

11:22.181 --> 11:23.849
and then I called the store,

11:24.600 --> 11:26.435
they said they hadn't seen her.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.900
Have you been having problems at home,
you and Jennifer?

11:35.152 --> 11:36.152
What do you mean?

11:37.154 --> 11:40.241
I'm trying to piece together
what your wife was doing

11:40.449 --> 11:42.702
at a rest area with no ID.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.705
Alone, in the middle of the night.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.252
And I'd love to know the same thing.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.295
But we had just gotten married,

11:53.379 --> 11:55.214
we had just moved to the mountains.

11:55.297 --> 11:56.590
So... no.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.883
No problems.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.679
Just one more thing.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.099
When your wife went to the store,
did she take her car?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.559
She did, yeah.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.520
- Why?
- It's missing.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.650
I'll start with a report on the car
and see what happens.

12:15.693 --> 12:18.779
I would love to talk to your wife
when she's able.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.321
Absolutely.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.326
I hope she gets better soon.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.828
Thank you for your time.

12:25.995 --> 12:26.995
Thank you.

13:18.631 --> 13:22.426
<i>Female, African-American,
ten years of age.</i>

13:23.219 --> 13:26.472
<i>You're a cop.
Why can't you find your own daughter?</i>

13:29.350 --> 13:33.437
<i>Police have no leads on the disappearance
of ten-year old Hannah Page.</i>

13:49.411 --> 13:50.411
Mr. Williams.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.705
She's awake.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.627
We'll continue to run extensive CTs,

13:56.710 --> 14:00.840
but you should know, the damage to
your wife's hippocampus was severe.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.676
And what does that mean exactly?

14:04.218 --> 14:07.555
While she'll retain a great deal
of her semantic memory -

14:07.638 --> 14:09.098
her name, her family -

14:09.181 --> 14:11.392
episodic recall is far less reliable.

14:12.309 --> 14:13.978
But she'll know who I am, right?

14:15.396 --> 14:16.230
Doc?

14:16.355 --> 14:18.274
We'll do everything to aid her...

14:18.357 --> 14:19.775
Okay, to aid her.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.111
Are you saying my wife
doesn't remember me?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.030
- It's possible.
- Don't give me "possible."

14:25.114 --> 14:27.283
Does my wife know who I am or not?

14:27.741 --> 14:28.741
No.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.830
We're going to get her there,
I promise you.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.339
Jennifer.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.426
Your husband's here to see you.

14:46.927 --> 14:47.928
Hey.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.390
- I'll be down the hall if you need me.
- Thanks.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.530
So how are you feeling?

15:09.617 --> 15:12.286
Sorry. You're probably...

15:13.037 --> 15:15.539
pretty overwhelmed.
I'll just sit right over here, okay?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.170
What happened?

15:22.838 --> 15:24.006
How did I get here?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.428
You were in an accident,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.096
and you hit your head.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.642
Really hard. Remember any of that?

15:40.314 --> 15:42.733
Jennifer, do you know who I am?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.238
You don't remember me, do you?

15:56.538 --> 15:57.873
It's okay, it's okay.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.791
Right, listen.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.337
Look, the doctor said
that there are going to be...

16:04.505 --> 16:07.257
some things that are harder
to remember than others.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.844
I'm going to be right here with you,
I promise.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.514
We're gonna do this together.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.685
I don't even know your name.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.229
I'm Russell.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.193
It's really nice to meet you.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.827
Look, I already told the other guy...

16:34.910 --> 16:37.371
I don't care about them.
You're talking to me now.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.625
I don't know. It was dark, it was raining.

16:41.709 --> 16:42.709
Were you speeding?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.337
Yeah.

16:47.464 --> 16:49.008
I just wanted to get home.

16:49.925 --> 16:50.968
I didn't even...

16:53.846 --> 16:55.848
I didn't see her until it was too late.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.976
- It was an accident.
- I know.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.020
That's not why I brought you in.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.356
I wanna know if you saw anyone else there.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.692
No.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.486
How about other cars in the parking lot?
Did you see any?

17:11.739 --> 17:12.739
Yeah.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.867
Now you mention it, there was...

17:16.326 --> 17:17.661
this white pickup.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.247
I think it was pulling a car.

17:20.329 --> 17:21.165
Pulling a car?

17:21.248 --> 17:23.625
Yeah, with a hauling winch, a cable.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.669
I remember thinking it was kinda strange.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.463
Did you see where the truck went?

17:28.088 --> 17:29.088
No.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.216
It was already gone
when the ambulance arrived.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.387
He didn't say anything
about a pickup truck before.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.848
The brain trust in Traffic didn't ask.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.475
Or maybe there wasn't one.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.394
She either drove herself there,
someone stole her car,

17:42.478 --> 17:45.397
or she was dropped off.
Either way, someone else was there.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.526
- I know what week this is, Frank.
- Don't.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.779
Whatever you do won't make up
for what happened.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.240
Scratches and bruises on her wrists.
They were defensive wounds.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.993
It also said they could've been caused
in the collision.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.496
I'll see if the drivers saw this truck.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.332
Look at you.
When's the last time you took a day off?

18:03.874 --> 18:05.542
I'm not a beach kind of guy.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.626
Hey, Frank.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.963
One of the accident witnesses
is waiting for you upfront.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.965
Thanks, Charlie.
Can you bring him back?

18:13.383 --> 18:16.512
Sorry, Sean.
You're not getting rid of me that easily.

18:16.678 --> 18:20.140
If you're gonna run with this,
make sure it's for the right reason.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.101
This was no accident.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.314
Have a seat right here.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.483
Mr. Kahn, thanks for coming in.

18:39.034 --> 18:42.037
So, you were in Operations,

18:42.663 --> 18:44.665
I was in Accounting.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.627
Here. There you go.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.924
And eventually, I worked up the nerve
to ask you out.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.886
You wanted to go
to one of those Japanese places

18:57.970 --> 19:01.473
where they cook in front of you,
they do the knife tricks.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.517
Onion volcano things.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.602
So the thing was...

19:06.436 --> 19:07.938
I was so nervous,

19:08.272 --> 19:10.440
and I was so worried about impressing you

19:10.524 --> 19:12.234
that I neglected to tell you

19:13.026 --> 19:14.695
I was allergic to shellfish.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.613
Oh, no.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.659
They cook everything on that griddle.

19:20.909 --> 19:21.994
It's not that funny,

19:22.077 --> 19:23.579
it's not funny at all...

19:23.662 --> 19:25.831
'cause I blew up like a blimp.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.504
I forgot to ask.
Have you talked to my parents?

19:32.671 --> 19:34.840
They must be worried.
They haven't heard from me.

19:41.471 --> 19:44.391
Honey, they passed away...

19:44.975 --> 19:46.310
a couple of years ago.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.227
What?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.609
Yeah, there was a fire, and...

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
they never made it out.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.201
Sorry, I thought that you...

20:05.120 --> 20:08.040
- Sorry.
- If you don't mind, I need a moment alone.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.545
Yeah, of course.
I'll just be right outside here.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.798
Can I help you, sir?

21:00.217 --> 21:03.845
I'm here about the young woman
that was in that accident two nights ago,

21:03.929 --> 21:05.138
off Route 33.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.056
And you are?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.641
A concerned party.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.313
Miss Williams is only seeing
family members at the moment.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.816
At least see
that Miss Williams gets these.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.192
Sure.

21:31.581 --> 21:32.708
Try that.

21:36.336 --> 21:37.336
Next.

22:11.788 --> 22:13.874
Jennifer, you'll hurt somebody.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.792
I can go really fast.

22:34.436 --> 22:36.104
I want you to keep up your memory games.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.607
They're just as important
as your physical rehab.

22:39.107 --> 22:41.109
Your CT came back, from yesterday.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.527
It shows improvement.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.780
It's not going to happen overnight.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.740
I wanna make sure that you're...

22:46.823 --> 22:48.533
I won't overdo it. I promise.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.994
- Here.
- Thank you.

22:51.119 --> 22:54.247
I'm sending you home with a cane, too.
I want you to use it to walk.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.333
- Two or three minutes a day.
- Okay.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.294
There she is.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.670
Big day.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.048
Baby's coming home.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.641
Hey... as the memory comes back,

23:12.849 --> 23:14.851
it's normal for wires to get crossed.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.019
Nothing to worry about.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.788
All right. Nice and slow.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.084
- Got it?
- Yeah.

23:39.167 --> 23:42.212
- I just need a little help, actually.
- One, two, three...

23:42.295 --> 23:44.172
- Thank you.
- Watch your head.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.342
- Okay. Take those.
- Thanks.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.520
Hey, it's gonna be okay, alright?

23:58.603 --> 23:59.813
We're gonna get through this.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.274
Baby steps.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.380
Welcome home.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.260
Pretty great, huh?

25:13.720 --> 25:15.347
It's been in the family a while.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.566
We moved in right before the wedding.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.155
Go ahead. Feel free. Go check it out.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.005
This is incredible.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.216
I love it.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.473
And this is the best part
about living out here.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.102
There's no shortage of firewood.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.398
Oh... I wish you could remember
our wedding night.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.692
We never even left this room.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.700
Hey, what's wrong?

26:17.784 --> 26:19.578
Nothing.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.207
Wait till you see the backyard.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.716
It's so beautiful.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.219
I still can't believe
this is really our house.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.805
Yeah, like I said, it's...

26:39.931 --> 26:41.516
it's been in the family for a while.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.563
I mean, it's been fixed up
and added onto over the years, but...

26:47.147 --> 26:49.149
- It's so quiet.
- Better be.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.735
Nearest neighbor is over a mile away.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.069
- Only a mile?
- Yeah.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.199
Now, if you grab a bottle of wine,

26:58.908 --> 27:02.245
sit in these chairs right over here,
you can catch one hell of a sunset.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.000
Any of this feel familiar?

27:08.376 --> 27:09.376
I'm sorry.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.004
For what?

27:13.173 --> 27:14.633
For not remembering you,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.509
our life together.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.971
It's gonna be okay.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.598
I promise.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.641
Here we go.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.404
So I was thinking
I'll probably start you out

27:36.488 --> 27:37.906
in the guest bedroom down here.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.408
- It's closer to the kitchen...
- No special treatment.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.495
I got it, but I just don't want you
to overdo it.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.997
I need us to get back to our old routine.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.545
So where is our bedroom?

27:55.090 --> 27:56.090
Up there.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.301
Right.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.179
No, no. Are you crazy?

28:02.972 --> 28:03.972
Really?

28:04.891 --> 28:06.893
Allow me, Mrs. Williams.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.199
Here we are.

28:21.783 --> 28:22.783
Wow.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.581
- Thank you.
- Careful, careful.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.542
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.712
Alright, let's do this.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.009
- I'll go get the rest of your stuff.
- Thanks.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.625
- Hello.
<i>- Russell Williams?</i>

29:13.668 --> 29:16.087
- Speaking.
<i>- This is Detective Page.</i>

29:16.963 --> 29:18.673
<i>We spoke at the hospital.</i>

29:19.758 --> 29:20.758
Yes, sir.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.552
Actually, could you...

29:23.219 --> 29:25.805
Could you just hold on for one second?

29:26.598 --> 29:29.392
I'll step out,
see if I can get a better signal.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.231
Sorry. Er...

29:38.193 --> 29:40.487
How's it going? Any luck finding the car?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.781
<i>No, not yet,</i>

29:42.864 --> 29:44.908
but I've talked to a couple of drivers

29:44.991 --> 29:46.409
who stopped to help your wife.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.703
Really? Did they see anything?

29:49.537 --> 29:53.875
Well, two of them thought they saw
a white pickup truck

29:53.958 --> 29:55.460
leave the scene of the accident.

29:55.710 --> 29:59.088
<i>One of them thought that it might've been
pulling your wife's car.</i>

29:59.380 --> 30:00.380
Okay.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.554
Well,
the other thinks that he saw the plates.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.766
<i>From his vintage Cadillac convertible.</i>

30:10.058 --> 30:11.476
Convertible? Ah.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.771
But in the meantime, I'd really love it

30:15.146 --> 30:17.440
if your wife could come down
to the station tomorrow.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.067
Maybe she remembers something.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.532
Look, we literally just got home,

30:25.615 --> 30:28.117
and the last thing I want to do
is overwhelm her.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.496
Mr. Williams, we promise
to take it easy on her.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.581
How does 11:00 sound?

30:37.752 --> 30:40.255
Yeah, 11:00 is great. Let's do that.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.423
Good. See you then.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.077
- What's tomorrow at 11:00?
- Huh?

31:11.870 --> 31:14.080
I overheard you outside on the phone.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.208
Oh, yeah. That was work calling.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.503
Wondering when I was coming back.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.004
Oh.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.675
I told them we just got home,

31:25.758 --> 31:27.594
and there's no way
I'll rush your recovery.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.929
Are they okay with me taking time off?

31:34.767 --> 31:37.270
Honey, actually, you quit your job

31:37.562 --> 31:38.938
when we moved out here.

31:39.814 --> 31:40.857
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.903
We'd decided we wanted to start a family

31:45.612 --> 31:47.447
and this was the best way to do it,

31:47.530 --> 31:49.449
came out here for the fresh air,

31:50.783 --> 31:51.868
and less stress.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.872
No job, no family.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.376
What about friends? I must have friends.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.545
You've plenty of friends.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.924
Since the move, we don't see them
as much as we used to.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.010
- Do they know what happened?
- Yeah.

32:09.636 --> 32:12.221
I spoke to Nancy
when we were leaving the hospital.

32:12.305 --> 32:14.140
I asked if she'd let everybody know.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.935
She and Jason will visit
once they get back from Hawaii.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.232
Oh. Maybe I should reach out to them, too.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.401
It might bring back some memories.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.945
Yeah, it's a great idea.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.239
Have the police found my phone?

32:32.033 --> 32:33.033
Not yet.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.996
Next time I'm out,
I'll just pick you up a new one.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.082
Thanks.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.727
We were happy, right?

33:03.356 --> 33:04.857
Honey, we're still happy.

33:05.858 --> 33:06.858
Okay?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.068
Okay.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.770
Excuse me. Sir?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.025
Why were you asking
about Jennifer Williams?

33:47.567 --> 33:48.567
What do you care?

33:50.570 --> 33:52.196
Actually, I care a lot.

33:52.864 --> 33:53.948
Who the hell are you?

33:56.367 --> 33:57.493
Her husband.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.041
Stay away from my wife!

34:23.603 --> 34:24.853
Anyone out here?

34:26.355 --> 34:27.440
Hello!

35:10.316 --> 35:11.859
Russell, do you hear that?

35:17.406 --> 35:18.406
Russell?

35:25.665 --> 35:27.583
Russell, there's someone in the backyard!

35:57.613 --> 35:58.698
You were out late.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.742
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.204
How about you?

36:06.539 --> 36:07.999
- I slept okay.
- Yeah?

36:09.292 --> 36:12.211
All right. Eggs, scrambled soft.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.798
- Just like you like them.
- Thanks.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.180
I think I'm gonna head into town today,
grab a few things.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.764
I'll grab you that phone.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.309
- Anything else you need?
- Nope.

36:27.226 --> 36:28.226
You're sure?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.646
I'll be fine, really.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.567
I feel like I need to take a look around.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.903
Maybe something will trigger my memory.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.905
Well, don't overdo it.

36:38.988 --> 36:39.988
I know.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.699
Orange juice?

36:45.870 --> 36:46.871
Fresh squeezed?

36:50.249 --> 36:51.459
I'm right, aren't I?

36:51.584 --> 36:53.377
There it is. See?

36:53.461 --> 36:55.254
I told you it'd all come back.

37:07.433 --> 37:11.687
Charlie. How many white pickup trucks
do you think there are in the county?

37:13.814 --> 37:14.814
I give up.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.067
Too goddamn many.

37:20.446 --> 37:22.240
Is anyone waiting upfront for me?

37:23.783 --> 37:24.617
You got a date?

37:24.700 --> 37:27.745
Actually, I think I've been stood up.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.254
<i>Hey, it's Russell.
I can't come to the phone right now.</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:37.880
<i>Leave a message, I'll call back.</i>

38:00.695 --> 38:01.695
Charlie.

38:04.490 --> 38:05.490
Do me a favor.

38:05.866 --> 38:08.369
Run a trace on this number. I'm going out.

38:21.757 --> 38:24.385
I ran a search on our database
for Russell Williams,

38:24.468 --> 38:25.678
but nothing came up.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.057
Do you mind searching
for the contact info he gave you?

38:31.851 --> 38:33.978
This is the address that he gave us.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.061
Thanks.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.773
Er, will you do me a favor?

38:37.857 --> 38:40.192
When you speak to her,
please have her call

38:40.276 --> 38:41.861
and make a follow-up appointment.

38:42.153 --> 38:45.448
Every time I've called
it's gone straight to voicemail.

38:46.907 --> 38:47.907
Will do.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.661
Just one question.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.082
Did Miss Williams ever mention
a white pickup truck?

38:57.043 --> 38:58.127
No, I don't think so.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.463
- Why?
- No, I was just wondering.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.882
- Thank you for all your help.
- Yeah.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.142
I'll love you forever and a day.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.342
What is that?

40:33.931 --> 40:35.182
That's weird.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.963
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.549
Look at you, made it down the steps.

43:13.632 --> 43:17.011
I was just exploring.
Seeing if anything felt familiar.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.094
Got it.

43:18.345 --> 43:19.847
Well, as promised...

43:21.890 --> 43:23.309
- For you.
- Oh, thank you.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.104
I had them set that up for you.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.230
Should be good to go.

43:30.649 --> 43:32.818
- And... how was it?
- What?

43:32.901 --> 43:35.321
While you were wandering,
anything come back to you?

43:35.404 --> 43:36.404
No.

43:38.282 --> 43:39.282
No signal.

43:39.867 --> 43:40.993
Yeah. Well...

43:41.535 --> 43:43.037
Welcome to the mountains.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.124
All right. Walk or carry?

43:48.334 --> 43:49.668
- Walk.
- Walk.

43:50.377 --> 43:51.377
- Shall we?
- Oh.

43:51.879 --> 43:53.088
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

43:53.255 --> 43:54.256
Take it easy.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.027
Can I help you?

44:18.906 --> 44:21.367
- I'd like to talk to Jennifer Williams.
- Who?

44:22.826 --> 44:24.453
Isn't this 58 Deerfield Road?

44:24.912 --> 44:25.912
Yes.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.916
I was told she lived here
with her husband Russell.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.669
Someone gave you the wrong information.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.295
It's just me and my husband.

44:34.046 --> 44:37.424
And you've never heard
of a Russell or Jennifer Williams?

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
No, Detective.

44:42.846 --> 44:44.056
Thank you for your time.

44:52.731 --> 44:53.899
<i>Sheriff's Department.</i>

44:54.441 --> 44:55.484
Hey, it's me.

44:56.360 --> 44:59.530
Looks like Russell Williams gave
the hospital the wrong address.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.907
Maybe he just made a mistake
on the forms.

45:02.658 --> 45:03.658
Tell me something.

45:04.743 --> 45:07.371
Did anyone actually run
the victim's prints?

45:07.871 --> 45:08.956
We didn't have to.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.666
The husband identified her.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.502
How did they find him to let him know
she was hurt?

45:13.836 --> 45:17.756
That's the thing. I asked, but...
nobody remembered calling anyone.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.885
I don't suppose you got a trace
on the number I gave you?

45:21.969 --> 45:23.262
<i>Looks like a burner.</i>

45:23.595 --> 45:26.640
We tried to trace it using GPS,
but there's no signal.

45:27.599 --> 45:28.600
Jesus.

45:29.059 --> 45:30.686
All right. Keep me updated.

45:36.859 --> 45:39.278
Nurse Masters said,
as memories come back,

45:39.361 --> 45:41.655
wires could probably get crossed.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.739
I know.

45:43.073 --> 45:44.742
You're healing, that's good news.

45:45.033 --> 45:46.618
But I'm so confused.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.544
Oh, baby.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.297
- You alright?
- Yeah.

45:59.339 --> 46:01.258
All the memories are gonna come back.

46:01.800 --> 46:02.800
I promise you.

46:04.595 --> 46:08.849
We've got every day from now,
the rest of our lives to make new ones.

46:11.351 --> 46:12.351
You're right.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.484
I'm glad you're home.

46:51.642 --> 46:52.642
I'm sorry.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.311
What's wrong?

46:54.812 --> 46:55.938
I'm sorry, I can't.

46:58.857 --> 46:59.857
You can't?

47:00.609 --> 47:04.154
Look, maybe I just need more time.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.657
Oh for God's sake, Jen.
I am your husband.

47:06.740 --> 47:07.740
Please...

47:08.700 --> 47:09.993
Okay, listen to me.

47:11.036 --> 47:13.121
I sat in that damn waiting room

47:13.831 --> 47:17.626
night after night, because I couldn't
stand not being there when you woke up.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.712
I was there at every step of your recovery
and this is what I get?

47:21.964 --> 47:24.633
- A wife who won't let me touch her?
- You're hurting me.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.063
Look, I'm sorry.

47:39.439 --> 47:40.858
Okay. I didn't mean it.

47:43.360 --> 47:45.195
Come on. Jen...

47:56.915 --> 47:57.915
Right.

48:32.951 --> 48:33.952
Good night.

49:17.245 --> 49:18.245
White Oaks ER.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.415
Nurse Masters, Detective Page.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.292
Hi, Detective.

49:22.626 --> 49:23.961
<i>Any luck reaching Jennifer?</i>

49:24.461 --> 49:25.461
Actually, no.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.131
<i>I was wondering,</i>

49:28.215 --> 49:31.426
can you pull up your surveillance cameras
from your parking lot

49:31.510 --> 49:32.761
<i>the night she came in?</i>

49:32.844 --> 49:34.763
Yeah, sure. I'll ask Security.

49:35.597 --> 49:37.015
What are we looking for?

49:37.265 --> 49:39.893
White pickup truck with a winch.

49:40.477 --> 49:42.020
White pickup truck, sure.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.313
Give me one sec.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.235
Got those real estate records
you asked for.

49:49.027 --> 49:52.489
That house has belonged
to Clark and Ruth Gibson since 1976.

49:52.864 --> 49:53.864
Thanks, Charlie.

49:54.992 --> 49:55.992
Now go home,

49:56.410 --> 49:57.953
before Samantha blames me.

49:58.495 --> 50:00.414
- I'll tell her you say hi.
- Please do.

50:01.415 --> 50:03.250
<i>- Detective?</i>
- I'm still here.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.336
Security just pulled the video file.

50:06.420 --> 50:07.963
They'll email it over to you.

50:08.296 --> 50:09.296
Thank you.

50:09.548 --> 50:11.383
If you need anything else, let me know.

50:11.633 --> 50:13.427
I was wondering one thing.

50:13.844 --> 50:14.928
<i>Yeah, shoot.</i>

50:15.262 --> 50:17.014
<i>Since Jennifer had no ID,</i>

50:17.472 --> 50:19.850
<i>how did Russell prove
he was her husband?</i>

50:21.393 --> 50:22.393
Give me one sec.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.157
It says here in the doctor's notes

50:35.240 --> 50:38.368
that he showed some family photos
and identified a back tattoo.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.498
- Thank you for all your help.
- Sorry, Detective.

50:44.291 --> 50:46.001
Thanks so much. Have a good night.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.421
Son of a bitch.

51:54.694 --> 51:55.694
Good morning.

52:00.909 --> 52:01.952
I brought you something.

52:03.829 --> 52:07.916
You always used to have a bunch of these
around the office, so we...

52:08.458 --> 52:10.877
actually planted a special plot
out there for you.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.845
Look, er...

52:24.182 --> 52:25.433
I owe you an apology.

52:27.769 --> 52:29.896
What I said last night was not fair.

52:30.897 --> 52:32.983
And it just... It got away from me.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.652
And I'm sorry.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.949
If you want to take it slow,
we will take it slow, absolutely.

52:41.491 --> 52:43.285
I want you to be comfortable.

52:54.462 --> 52:56.089
- I'll be right out.
- Thanks.

52:59.509 --> 53:00.509
Hey.

53:01.136 --> 53:04.055
- What can I do for you?
- Whoa, man. Did that hurt?

53:04.472 --> 53:07.225
Why? You looking to get some silver?
Maybe one of these conches?

53:07.517 --> 53:09.227
I'm more interested in these.

53:11.271 --> 53:12.271
Heritage, huh?

53:12.522 --> 53:14.691
- Yeah. You do them?
- I can do anything you want.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.486
Can you tell me what that means?

53:19.654 --> 53:20.654
Sure.

53:25.952 --> 53:28.288
Abby, Abbot, Adams, and...

53:29.956 --> 53:30.956
Allen.

53:36.504 --> 53:37.504
How about that?

53:57.442 --> 53:58.735
<i>Charlie, it's me.</i>

53:59.486 --> 54:01.404
<i>I got a hit on Jennifer's maiden name.</i>

54:02.364 --> 54:05.158
<i>She shared a house with her parents
down in San Jose.</i>

54:05.408 --> 54:06.826
<i>I'm on my way there now.</i>

55:01.423 --> 55:02.423
Hello?

55:05.427 --> 55:06.553
This is the police!

55:36.374 --> 55:37.374
Hello?

55:38.877 --> 55:40.128
Is there anyone here?

55:48.345 --> 55:49.345
Hello?

55:52.098 --> 55:53.098
Jennifer Allen?

56:01.941 --> 56:02.941
Oh.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.069
Oh!

57:10.844 --> 57:11.844
Morning.

57:12.345 --> 57:13.345
Morning.

57:15.306 --> 57:17.183
So... any plans today?

57:18.143 --> 57:20.687
No, not really.
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

57:22.313 --> 57:25.400
How about we do a romantic dinner tonight?

57:32.407 --> 57:33.407
Yeah.

57:33.950 --> 57:35.994
How about I cook?

57:36.911 --> 57:39.122
- What's your favorite again?
- Italian.

57:39.247 --> 57:40.832
You make a killer lasagna.

57:42.250 --> 57:45.170
Do you mind going out
and grabbing some groceries?

57:45.253 --> 57:46.921
Not at all. I'd be happy to.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.089
And some wine?

57:49.841 --> 57:51.718
Yeah. Do you want white or red?

57:52.469 --> 57:54.387
- Better get red if it's Italian.
- Red it is.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.316
I'll be right back.

58:06.524 --> 58:07.524
Drive safe.

58:31.674 --> 58:32.884
Did he just lock it?

59:44.122 --> 59:45.248
Jennifer and Russell?

59:45.331 --> 59:47.208
They left the company before the wedding.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.252
That was about two months ago.

59:49.919 --> 59:52.171
- So you know Russell?
- Are you kidding?

59:52.422 --> 59:54.257
They were the big office couple.

59:54.799 --> 59:56.551
HR usually frowns on that kind of thing,

59:56.634 --> 59:59.262
but they were cute together.
What you gonna do?

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.877
Those are from the corporate retreat
last year.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.254
- Mm-hm.
- And... there.

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:35.423
That's the happy couple right there.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.534
If that's Russell, who's that?

01:01:04.285 --> 01:01:05.285
Ryan Gaerity?

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:09.248
What's this all about anyway?
Are they in some kind of trouble?

01:01:15.463 --> 01:01:16.714
He still works here?

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:19.217
Not for the last couple of months.

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.178
He and his supervisor
had a little disagreement.

01:01:23.304 --> 01:01:24.597
Disagreement meaning...?

01:01:25.431 --> 01:01:27.058
Broke his nose in three places.

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.311
Ryan's a smart guy,
but he's got a hell of a temper.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:33.523
Did something happen, Detective?

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.777
I'm gonna need all the contact info
you can give me.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.403
Sure.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.864
And by the way,

01:01:42.156 --> 01:01:44.242
after they left, I found a little note

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.120
that Russell wrote to Jennifer,
buried in her desk.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.163
It's yours if you think it might help.

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:50.998
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.897
I'll love you forever and a day.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.045
What?

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.090
How can we have no Internet?

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.257
Where's the...

01:03:01.527 --> 01:03:02.945
You gotta be kidding me.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.001
Jennifer.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.464
Jennifer.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:10.805
You okay?

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.724
You took a hell of a fall.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:24.151
Oh, sweetheart,
that doesn't look good at all.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.235
What happened?

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:28.698
What did you think was gonna happen?

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.534
Roaming around in the yard
in your condition?

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.537
- What were you doing out there?
- What's going on?

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:38.666
Wait. What did you do to my phone?

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:40.376
What happened to the Internet?

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:43.004
- Don't get so worked up. Listen.
- No...

01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:44.714
Take your medication, okay?

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.674
- I don't want medication.
- Rest a while.

01:04:46.757 --> 01:04:49.802
- I don't want to rest!
- You need to. It'll be good for you.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.395
Okay. Now give that about 20 minutes,

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.441
and I promise you,
you won't feel any more pain, okay?

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:05.818
Who the hell are you?

01:05:08.195 --> 01:05:11.616
- What do you mean?
- What did you do with my husband?

01:05:19.832 --> 01:05:21.000
What are you doing?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.668
Wait, Russell.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.838
After everything that I have done for you,

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.049
I hoped that by now,

01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:31.052
you'd give me a little more gratitude.

01:05:34.388 --> 01:05:36.140
- No.
- Shh!

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.643
Just stay right here.
I'm gonna get some work done.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:41.187
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520
Wait...

01:05:43.814 --> 01:05:45.232
Wait... no...

01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:49.904
Oh, God.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:06.711
Mr. Williams?

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:09.047
Russell?

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:11.550
Russell Williams.

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.302
Mr. Williams.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.637
Mr. Williams.

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:20.142
Hey.

01:06:20.267 --> 01:06:22.561
I've tried to call you
to start physical therapy.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:23.813
Your number doesn't work.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:24.896
That's so funny.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.441
Jennifer and I were saying
how we hadn't heard from you.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.067
How's she doing?

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.110
She's great.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:32.530
That detective's looking for her.

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:34.115
- Detective?
- Yeah.

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:38.452
Frankly, I've been concerned as well.
None of the numbers that you gave us work.

01:06:38.536 --> 01:06:41.163
No, I probably got a number crossed
somewhere.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.915
Tell me where Jennifer is.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:46.752
I really appreciate your help,
thank you, but she's doing great.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:47.670
I gotta go.

01:06:47.753 --> 01:06:49.913
- I'm gonna call the detective.
- Get away from my car.

01:06:49.964 --> 01:06:50.964
Excuse me?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.094
Mr. Williams...

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:51.441
Russell?

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:53.819
Russell!

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:56.488
Russell!

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:23.546
Ah.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.009
- You're back.
- I ran into Nurse Masters while I was out.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.677
Really?

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.890
She asked how you were doing.

01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:39.396
How are we doing by the way?

01:12:49.948 --> 01:12:50.949
What's that?

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.167
I'll just be a second.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.974
Hey, we're actually busy right now.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:18.894
It'd be great if you could come back
another time.

01:13:19.311 --> 01:13:21.980
<i>Russell, this is Detective Page.</i>

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:24.149
<i>Can you open up the gate?</i>

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.484
<i>I want to talk.</i>

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.194
<i>Russell?</i>

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.994
Sure, yeah. Come on in.

01:14:09.945 --> 01:14:10.945
Russell?

01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:28.607
Help! Help!

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:33.237
There's a door in the back.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:02.266
No, no!

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:04.892
Get away!

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:08.021
We are really starting to have
some trust issues here, aren't we?

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:09.940
Please, tell me who you are!

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:14.528
I'm your husband.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:18.240
The sooner you realize that,
the better everything will be, I promise.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:25.664
No, no. Please, don't.

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.042
Did you do this?

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.921
Not bad.

01:16:36.383 --> 01:16:37.509
Now listen to me.

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:42.097
If that leg is ever gonna get better,
you're gonna have to stay off it.

01:16:42.598 --> 01:16:44.266
Okay? Promise me you'll stay off it.

01:16:49.896 --> 01:16:50.896
Say it.

01:16:54.359 --> 01:16:55.694
Say it.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.657
I promise I'll stay off of it.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:22.387
Do you have any idea
what I have done for you?

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:48.788
Come on.

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:50.998
Damn it.

01:17:58.924 --> 01:18:02.969
<i>We're here live with the talented
and incredibly sexy...</i>

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.681
<i>Excuse me... intelligent
and utterly amazing.</i>

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.974
<i>But enough about me...</i>

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:11.687
<i>I love you.</i>

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:14.314
<i>- Forever and a day, right?
- Right.</i>

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.428
Russell... what are you doing?

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.054
No.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.816
I don't know why I try anymore.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.989
All I have ever wanted...

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.950
was for you to love me,

01:19:08.118 --> 01:19:10.328
and for you to know how much I love you.

01:19:10.412 --> 01:19:14.124
I would've given up my entire world
just to be a part of yours.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.669
Please. Whatever you want me to do,
I'll do it.

01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:21.006
I don't want to die.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:24.091
Please...

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.805
None of us does, but...

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:31.265
then again,

01:19:32.684 --> 01:19:34.519
it's not up to us now, is it?

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.898
Wait. We don't have to pretend anymore.
Or lie.

01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:39.441
- I promise.
- I know that.

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:41.485
I know, and it's not your fault.

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:44.529
Because you can't remember.

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:49.034
Do you know how many years I spent
working with you in that office?

01:19:57.334 --> 01:20:00.462
Years getting to know you.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.508
Getting to understand you.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:20.524
And all for the great Russell Williams
to come along...

01:20:22.108 --> 01:20:23.443
and take what was mine.

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:31.076
No.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.755
I know you better than anyone else.

01:20:47.759 --> 01:20:49.594
I'm the one that you should be with,

01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:51.136
not him.

01:20:59.104 --> 01:21:00.438
And so I fixed it.

01:21:10.323 --> 01:21:13.034
I took care of anyone
that could get in my way.

01:21:13.743 --> 01:21:15.871
I probably would have killed you, too,
but...

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.542
the funniest thing happened.

01:21:22.752 --> 01:21:24.379
Fate gave me a chance.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:30.093
Now, with a clean slate, I could give you
the life that you always deserved.

01:21:32.512 --> 01:21:34.681
We can start a new life together,

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:37.142
you and me.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:40.603
Don't touch me.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:01.166
I'm really starting to feel unappreciated.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:33.549
What was that?

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.553
Sorry, I bumped the table.

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:40.890
You know, I've been...

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:43.685
thinking about what you said before.

01:23:46.312 --> 01:23:48.273
I never knew you felt that way about me.

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.359
Well, whether you know it or not,

01:23:51.484 --> 01:23:53.695
I've always been looking out for you.

01:23:54.988 --> 01:23:56.656
Why didn't you ever say anything?

01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:06.207
Russell, you never gave us a chance.

01:24:09.294 --> 01:24:11.379
I can see how much you care about me now.

01:24:12.255 --> 01:24:15.091
And I have been such a burden.

01:24:17.302 --> 01:24:18.845
No, you haven't been a burden.

01:24:21.514 --> 01:24:23.099
You know, love takes time.

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:26.685
It does.

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.900
How are you? Can I get you anything?

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:35.445
Maybe something to drink?

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.071
Sure.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:46.283
Jennifer!

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:49.913
Jennifer!

01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:09.641
Honey, we're all alone out here.

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:15.605
What are you gonna do?

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:29.409
Honey!

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.405
Get up.

01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:29.886
Jennifer!

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:45.611
Sweetheart!

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.206
Jennifer!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:45.440
Why did it have to be like this?

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:51.487
Why couldn't you just be happy?

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:56.534
Please, no.

01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:20.600
You couldn't let us be happy, could you?

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:56.761
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:58.429 --> 01:31:59.429
It's all right.

01:32:00.097 --> 01:32:01.097
It's okay.

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:03.016
It's okay.

01:32:03.559 --> 01:32:04.560
It's all right.

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:08.313
It's okay.

01:32:43.891 --> 01:32:44.891
Detective.

01:32:46.852 --> 01:32:47.852
Look at you.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.606
How're you doing, Jennifer?

01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:52.608
Good. Better.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:55.611
No cane and everything.

01:32:56.654 --> 01:32:58.114
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:02.368
You leaving?

01:33:02.785 --> 01:33:04.370
Yeah, off to Scottsdale,

01:33:05.037 --> 01:33:07.999
to spend the rest of my days playing golf
and dating divorcees.

01:33:08.708 --> 01:33:09.708
Sounds fun.

01:33:10.126 --> 01:33:11.126
It's overdue.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:12.586
Good for you.

01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:14.045
What about you?

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:15.881
Going back down to San Jose?

01:33:15.965 --> 01:33:18.843
Yeah. I just wanted to say goodbye
before I left.

01:33:19.468 --> 01:33:20.511
And to thank you.

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:21.928
You're welcome.

01:33:22.471 --> 01:33:24.307
Hell, I almost forgot.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.811
I went to your old office
and your boss gave me this.

01:33:29.186 --> 01:33:31.314
I would have brought it to the hospital,

01:33:31.397 --> 01:33:33.566
but the nurse said
you were already discharged.

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:37.527
Thanks.

01:33:37.987 --> 01:33:38.987
For everything.

01:33:39.405 --> 01:33:40.405
You're welcome.

01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:43.576
Take good care, Jennifer.

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:07.892
<i>Jennifer, I know it's probably silly
writing you a little note like this,</i>

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:10.895
<i>knowing we're about to spend
the rest of our lives together,</i>

01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:15.316
<i>but I just wanted you to know
that regardless of what happens next,</i>

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:16.859
<i>the time we've spent together</i>

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:19.737
<i>are the happiest memories
I could ever ask for.</i>

01:34:20.237 --> 01:34:21.238
<i>I love you.</i>

01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.282
<i>Not only for who you are,</i>

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:25.451
<i>but for who I am when I'm with you.</i>

01:34:26.035 --> 01:34:28.329
<i>I'll love you forever and a day.</i>

01:34:28.871 --> 01:34:29.871
<i>Russell.</i>
