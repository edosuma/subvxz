You're late.
And we're dying.

00:16.154 --> 00:17.287
Oh, someone shoot me.

00:17.289 --> 00:18.888
Girls' night again last night?

00:18.890 --> 00:20.590
What was it this time?
Let me guess.

00:22.127 --> 00:23.493
Ugh. Vermouth.

00:23.495 --> 00:24.853
Mm.

00:24.877 --> 00:26.030
You know, that stuff's
not supposed to be

00:26.031 --> 00:28.164
guzzled-- it's an apéritif.

00:28.166 --> 00:29.432
A what?

00:29.434 --> 00:31.367
An apéritif.

00:31.369 --> 00:33.436
Alcoholic beverage
served before the meal

00:33.438 --> 00:35.171
to stimulate the appetite.

00:35.173 --> 00:36.506
Pretty fancy talk
for a guy carrying

00:36.508 --> 00:37.907
a box of
stolen pickles.

00:37.909 --> 00:39.142
These are not stolen.

00:39.144 --> 00:41.010
The distributor
over-ordered,

00:41.012 --> 00:42.579
my cousin did some, uh,

00:42.581 --> 00:44.214
creative inventory management.

00:44.216 --> 00:46.282
Pickle thief cousin
is going to get you

00:46.284 --> 00:48.118
into trouble.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.385
They're just
pickles.

00:49.387 --> 00:50.587
Tell me how some pickles

00:50.589 --> 00:52.088
are gonna get me in trouble.

00:53.391 --> 00:55.725
My God.

Morning.

01:34.499 --> 01:37.066
See any good cat videos lately?

01:37.068 --> 01:38.968
Did I miss something?

01:38.970 --> 01:41.171
No, just making small talk.

01:41.173 --> 01:42.338
Ah.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.740
Hey, is that a new shirt?

01:43.742 --> 01:45.241
It's really white.

01:45.243 --> 01:47.343
No. I actually made
a New Year's resolution

01:47.345 --> 01:50.747
to separate my whites from my col...

01:55.587 --> 01:56.920
You looking for this?

01:56.922 --> 01:58.621
"New Year's Resolutions"
by Tim McGee?

01:58.623 --> 02:00.690
You went into my desk?

02:00.692 --> 02:03.226
Look at that.
"Number four, lock my desk."

02:03.228 --> 02:04.294
You've already failed.

02:04.296 --> 02:05.628
All right, give me that.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.198
Who makes a New Year's
resolution to stop watching

02:08.199 --> 02:09.499
cat videos?

02:09.501 --> 02:10.934
A lonely federal agent

02:10.936 --> 02:13.303
who may be in need of a cat.

02:13.305 --> 02:16.105
What are your
New Year's resolutions, huh?

02:16.107 --> 02:18.741
You got to see mine.
Show me yours.

02:18.743 --> 02:20.577
He stopped drinking coffee.

02:20.579 --> 02:21.845
No, I did not.

02:21.847 --> 02:23.046
Although that
would be a good one.

02:23.048 --> 02:25.281
What? No, no, not
you. Agent Gibbs.

02:25.283 --> 02:27.750
What? Gibbs doesn't make
New Year's resolutions.

02:27.752 --> 02:28.952
It's not a resolution.
I overheard him

02:28.954 --> 02:30.286
talking to Dr. Mallard.

02:30.288 --> 02:31.855
Gibbs is going in for a
checkup and his doctor

02:31.857 --> 02:33.389
told him to avoid
caffeine for

02:33.391 --> 02:34.757
72 hours.

02:34.759 --> 02:37.327
Mm-mm, that seems... unwise.

02:37.329 --> 02:38.962
That could kill him.
Or worse.

02:38.964 --> 02:41.598
T-The guy-guy's scary enough
when he's properly medicated.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.901
Can't imagine what he'll be like
with caffeine withdrawal.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.436
Can only imagine

02:46.438 --> 02:48.771
someone taking away
King Kong's bananas.

02:51.977 --> 02:54.043
I'm not going
to turn around.

02:54.045 --> 02:56.446
Good idea.

02:56.448 --> 02:57.947
That's a good analogy, Jim.

02:57.949 --> 02:59.916
Thank you.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.084
It wasn't the greatest, boss.

03:01.086 --> 03:03.086
Got five bodies.

03:03.088 --> 03:04.754
Let's go.

03:11.696 --> 03:13.096
This is...

03:13.098 --> 03:14.898
a lot of dead bodies.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.900
What do you think happened?

03:16.902 --> 03:18.234
You tell me.

03:18.236 --> 03:19.869
Uh...

03:21.873 --> 03:24.674
Looks like they all
shot each other.

03:24.676 --> 03:27.810
Some kind of Mexican standoff.

03:27.812 --> 03:29.178
Interestingly enough,

03:29.180 --> 03:31.681
that term
is of Australian origin.

03:31.683 --> 03:33.483
At least, according
to the <i> Cambridge</i>

03:33.485 --> 03:35.351
<i>Advanced Learner's</i>
<i>Dictionary.</i>

03:35.353 --> 03:37.320
Though it's unattributed,
so I have my doubts.

03:37.322 --> 03:38.821
Mm, good to know.

03:38.823 --> 03:40.490
Where should we start?

03:40.492 --> 03:42.458
Right here. The captain.

03:42.460 --> 03:45.328
Captain Sharon Hanover, 43.

03:45.330 --> 03:47.764
A desk jockey
at the Pentagon who

03:47.766 --> 03:51.501
apparently also likes
to get into gunfights?

03:51.503 --> 03:52.802
Let's get some bags.

03:52.804 --> 03:54.737
McGEE:
Boss, spoke with the owner.

03:54.739 --> 03:56.406
None of the bodies
are employees.

03:56.408 --> 03:58.975
Did he recognize anybody?
No, but he's

03:58.977 --> 04:00.243
acting a little
squirrelly.

04:00.245 --> 04:01.844
I don't know nothing.

04:01.846 --> 04:03.813
Yeah, you said that.
So we're done here?

04:03.815 --> 04:05.181
No.

04:06.217 --> 04:08.651
Every time you say
you don't know nothing,

04:08.653 --> 04:10.253
it makes me think
you know something.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.154
Yeah, it's a real

04:11.156 --> 04:13.656
pickle.
Alice.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.392
There something
you want to tell us?

04:16.394 --> 04:17.423
No.

04:17.447 --> 04:19.447
If you don't tell him
about the pickles, I will.

04:19.464 --> 04:21.164
What's the deal
with the pickles?

04:21.166 --> 04:22.699
No, ma'am, you can't
walk up through here.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.367
I just have to go inside.
No, no, no, no,

04:24.369 --> 04:25.902
no, no. You see
the yellow line?

04:25.904 --> 04:27.670
You can't cross the yellow line.
What are you gonna to do, arrest me?

04:27.672 --> 04:30.039
I'll be right back.

04:30.041 --> 04:32.809
Ooh. Hold the pickle.

04:32.811 --> 04:34.210
And you have no idea who I am,

04:34.212 --> 04:36.145
you overgrown,
armed Smurf.

04:36.147 --> 04:39.082
I need to see agent Gibbs
and I need to see him now.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.249
You're gonna have to wait.

04:40.251 --> 04:42.085
All right, Officer 9-60,

04:42.087 --> 04:43.653
thank you very much,
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:43.655 --> 04:46.155
Mr. Wilson.
What's going on?

04:46.157 --> 04:48.324
You know this woman?
My ex-wife.

04:49.427 --> 04:51.894
Hello, J.

04:51.896 --> 04:54.197
And that one?

04:58.336 --> 05:00.370
Also...

05:00.372 --> 05:02.038
my ex-wife.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.227
Aw, look at him.
He didn't know whether

05:19.228 --> 05:21.094
to run or wet himself.
I like it.

05:21.096 --> 05:22.762
Fear is sexy.

05:22.764 --> 05:24.498
You two know each other?

05:24.500 --> 05:26.233
Heads up. Lady Octopus sighting.

05:26.235 --> 05:27.367
Well, he's not running.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.269
Hope he has a clean
pair of underwear.

05:29.271 --> 05:30.770
He didn't wear underwear
when we were married.

05:30.772 --> 05:32.305
I'm...

05:32.307 --> 05:33.940
gonna go someplace else.

05:33.942 --> 05:35.342
Works for me.

05:35.344 --> 05:36.743
What's she doing here?

05:36.745 --> 05:39.379
- And who is she with?
- Number two.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.881
That's wife number two.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.716
We have a visual
confirmation.

05:42.718 --> 05:44.551
Well, Jethro,
you gonna say anything

05:44.553 --> 05:47.320
or did your tongue
finally shrivel up and die?

05:47.322 --> 05:48.481
You two know each other?

05:48.505 --> 05:49.757
What, are you and Tobias
the only two exes

05:49.758 --> 05:51.024
that get to be friends?

05:51.026 --> 05:52.859
We met at an emotional dwarf
support group.

05:52.861 --> 05:55.328
- That's a good one, I like that.
- : Thanks.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.897
What are you doing here?

05:58.667 --> 06:01.668
I brought her.
You two need to talk.

06:01.670 --> 06:03.470
And we all know that's not
something you're interested in.

06:03.472 --> 06:05.172
Got that right.

06:05.174 --> 06:06.740
So I suggested that we...

06:06.742 --> 06:08.942
Ambush me at a crime scene
so I can't get away?

06:09.945 --> 06:11.678
Get back to work.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.780
Sorry, boss, we-we were just
taking these cases back to...

06:13.782 --> 06:16.149
Your final resting place?

06:17.286 --> 06:19.419
There's a thing up there.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.820
I can't talk right now.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.122
- Then I'll wait.
- That's not gonna work.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.157
Okay, okay, let's compromise.

06:24.159 --> 06:26.726
We'll got back to NCIS and meet
you there once you're done here.

06:26.728 --> 06:28.962
Do I have a choice?
Well, that depends--

06:28.964 --> 06:30.297
how do you feel
about spending the next

06:30.299 --> 06:32.699
six months being audited?

06:33.502 --> 06:36.169
By me.

06:36.171 --> 06:39.239
Victim number one, Staff
Sergeant Samson Delgado.

06:39.241 --> 06:41.274
Teaches combat training
at Quantico.

06:41.276 --> 06:42.542
Likes pumping iron,

06:42.544 --> 06:44.544
hiking,
and pumping iron.

06:44.546 --> 06:46.079
Victim number two--

06:46.081 --> 06:48.181
Chief Petty Officer
Beau Lordin.

06:48.183 --> 06:49.950
Just got back
from Afghanistan,

06:49.952 --> 06:51.218
where he received
a commendation

06:51.220 --> 06:53.954
for saving two locals
from a land mine.

06:55.724 --> 06:57.924
Yeesh.

06:57.926 --> 07:00.360
Uh, you weren't
supposed to see that, boss.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.531
But, uh, now that you did,

07:04.533 --> 07:06.766
we were
just wondering...

07:06.768 --> 07:09.469
Wife number two--

07:09.471 --> 07:11.671
she's the one you caught
in bed with the other guy?

07:11.673 --> 07:13.073
I wasn't wondering that.

07:13.075 --> 07:14.207
Uh, me, neither.

07:14.209 --> 07:16.009
It was just me, then.
Moving on.

07:16.011 --> 07:18.845
All five victims
have stellar records.

07:18.847 --> 07:21.081
Nothing to indicate
any criminal activity.

07:21.083 --> 07:23.250
Anything in common?

07:23.252 --> 07:25.752
Uh, yes, they all failed
to report for duty last week.

07:25.754 --> 07:27.120
There's something else,
boss, but I'm not

07:27.122 --> 07:29.055
quite sure what
to make of it.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.991
They're all late
paying their taxes.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.759
They've paid enough
late fees to buy a small bank

07:32.761 --> 07:34.828
in the Caymans.
It could be nothing.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.463
Run it down.
But we're gonna run it down.

07:36.465 --> 07:39.099
Find out how our victims
ended up in that diner.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.868
Okay.

07:42.904 --> 07:44.771
What did we learn?

07:44.773 --> 07:47.140
I can't tell you how our victims
ended up in the diner,

07:47.142 --> 07:48.642
but do I have
a good idea of

07:48.644 --> 07:50.610
what happened once
they got there.

07:50.612 --> 07:53.113
Our male victims
surrounded our female victim.

07:53.115 --> 07:54.547
She was here.

07:54.549 --> 07:56.283
She got off the first shot.

07:56.285 --> 07:59.085
Male number one never
even fired his weapon.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.321
Captain Hanover took on
heavy fire after that.

08:01.323 --> 08:02.956
One to the shoulder,
one to the arm.

08:02.958 --> 08:04.357
She kept firing, took out male

08:04.359 --> 08:06.893
number two
and male number three.

08:06.895 --> 08:08.428
Then she dropped to one knee,

08:08.430 --> 08:11.831
fired three more shots,
took out male number four.

08:11.833 --> 08:14.067
And by then she had
lost too much blood.

08:15.370 --> 08:16.836
It wasn't a Mexican standoff.

08:16.838 --> 08:19.039
No. It was four against one.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.275
Hanover put up a hell of a fight.
Yeah. I mean,

08:22.277 --> 08:25.345
for a desk jockey with very
little weapons experience.

08:25.347 --> 08:27.213
I mean, unless Morpheus
had just downloaded

08:27.215 --> 08:29.149
<i>Dirty Harry</i> into her
brain. Or else she's

08:29.151 --> 08:30.398
not who she seems. Do
you want some of this?

08:30.422 --> 08:31.952
Yeah.

08:31.953 --> 08:34.020
Uh, ballistics?

08:34.022 --> 08:37.724
Um, all the serial numbers
were ground down,

08:37.726 --> 08:40.159
and I didn't get any hits
on the ballistics databases,

08:40.162 --> 08:42.429
but I did find
something interesting

08:42.431 --> 08:44.898
in our victims' calendars.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.367
They all had appointments

08:47.369 --> 08:49.769
on the books
with a tax-consulting firm

08:49.771 --> 08:51.304
the weekend they disappeared.

08:51.306 --> 08:52.839
The same firm, Gibbs.

08:52.841 --> 08:53.873
Got an address?

08:53.875 --> 08:54.974
No. Just a name.

08:54.976 --> 08:58.111
We Got Your Back Taxes.

08:58.113 --> 09:00.013
I ran a search,
but nothing came up.

09:00.015 --> 09:01.448
Well, keep looking.

09:01.450 --> 09:02.782
Call me if you
find something.

09:02.784 --> 09:03.917
I'll be at home.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.552
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:05.554 --> 09:08.221
Ex-wife number two?

09:08.223 --> 09:10.156
I thought she was coming here
to see you.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.359
Yeah, she's coming.

09:12.361 --> 09:14.728
That's why I'm going home.

09:43.925 --> 09:45.358
What do you got, McGee?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.693
Well, Tony found a business card

09:46.695 --> 09:48.561
in one
of the victim's office desk.

09:48.563 --> 09:50.964
It has the address
of our missing tax consultants,

09:50.966 --> 09:52.132
but it's all the way
in Bridgewater.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.266
Then we start early.

09:53.268 --> 09:54.968
Pick me up at dawn.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.436
Actually, can we make it 7:00?

09:56.438 --> 09:58.538
Since Diane works at the IRS,

09:58.540 --> 10:00.540
she offered to pull
our victims' tax records.

10:00.542 --> 10:01.975
She's dropping them off
tomorrow.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.576
Diane?
McGEE: Yeah.

10:03.578 --> 10:06.346
She, uh, came in with ex-wife
number two after you left.

10:06.348 --> 10:09.182
I got to say, boss, she was
crazy mad you were gone.

10:09.184 --> 10:11.484
McGee, it's because
she is crazy.

10:12.788 --> 10:14.788
I'm crazy? Says the guy

10:14.790 --> 10:16.923
who cuts his toenails
with a tin snip.

10:16.925 --> 10:18.458
You lied to me!

10:18.460 --> 10:20.460
You promised to meet
me back at NCIS!

10:20.462 --> 10:22.695
I didn't hear the word "promise."
Oh, no, no.

10:22.697 --> 10:26.599
No. You are not weaseling
out of this this time, you...

10:27.869 --> 10:30.103
You...

10:30.105 --> 10:32.472
are right.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.741
Technically, you didn't
use the word "promise."

10:37.345 --> 10:39.612
But I'm here now,
and we need to talk.

10:39.614 --> 10:41.548
I don't need to talk.

10:41.550 --> 10:43.116
I do.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.066
Want a drink?

11:00.068 --> 11:02.035
I-I don't

11:02.037 --> 11:05.038
drink anymore.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.775
That's actually why I'm here.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.243
To not drink?

11:15.851 --> 11:17.884
I...

11:17.886 --> 11:19.853
bottomed out...

11:19.855 --> 11:21.988
about a year ago.

11:27.829 --> 11:30.230
A friend got me
into the program.

11:30.232 --> 11:32.432
It saved my life.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.538
And now, I'm at the part
where you make amends.

11:40.275 --> 11:44.210
Which, in your case,
starts with... I'm sorry.

11:44.212 --> 11:47.347
Oh. Ancient history.

11:47.349 --> 11:50.216
You walked in on me in
bed with another man.

11:50.218 --> 11:52.886
I don't think there's a
statute of limitations.

11:55.557 --> 11:58.057
I can't imagine what
that must have been like.

12:00.028 --> 12:02.629
I am so sorry, J.

12:04.866 --> 12:06.833
Okay.

12:06.835 --> 12:09.302
Okay?

12:09.304 --> 12:11.905
Yeah. Okay.

12:13.975 --> 12:15.808
It's why I always liked you.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.645
A man of few words, but
always the right ones.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.652
You doing all right now?

12:25.654 --> 12:27.787
Yeah, better than all right.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.455
You?

12:29.457 --> 12:31.891
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Oh, same.

12:31.893 --> 12:34.093
Aside from a killer headache.

12:40.602 --> 12:43.036
Well, I always knew
how to fix those.

12:47.776 --> 12:50.076
Come here.

12:50.078 --> 12:52.812
It's... Come here.

12:56.952 --> 12:58.184
Man.

12:58.186 --> 13:00.019
I remember those fingers.

13:00.021 --> 13:03.089
Hmm.

13:25.056 --> 13:27.122
Boss?

13:27.124 --> 13:28.323
Boss?

13:28.324 --> 13:30.591
Chuckie, what's taking so long?

13:31.760 --> 13:33.927
- Boss?
- How long does it take to...?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.864
Holy Fourth of July
weenie roast!

13:38.200 --> 13:39.733
What the hell am I looking at?!

13:39.735 --> 13:41.335
Whoa!

13:41.337 --> 13:43.103
Whoa!

13:43.105 --> 13:44.905
This is not what
it looks like.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.106
What does it look like?

13:46.108 --> 13:48.041
We were up talking,
and we fell asleep.

13:48.043 --> 13:49.710
Just wore yourselves
right out, huh?

13:50.779 --> 13:51.979
I'm gonna go wait
in the car.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.647
You are supposed

13:53.649 --> 13:55.649
to be making amends,
not making his year!

13:55.651 --> 13:57.784
I didn't! I wouldn't! Yuck!

13:57.786 --> 13:59.453
Yuck?

13:59.455 --> 14:01.355
What's that supposed to mean?

14:01.357 --> 14:04.091
Five hours ago, you
couldn't wait to rub my...

14:04.093 --> 14:05.259
Oh, look. It's a cat.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.360
Outside. I'm gonna go help it.

14:06.362 --> 14:09.062
McGee, stop!
What is she doing here?

14:09.064 --> 14:10.631
Don't try to change the subject.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.432
That's an order.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.701
She found something
in our victim's tax records.

14:14.703 --> 14:17.337
Wanted to tell you herself.
So tell me.

14:17.339 --> 14:18.539
So tell him.

14:18.541 --> 14:19.840
Oh, you think I'm gonna
let the two of you

14:19.842 --> 14:20.974
off the hook that easy?

14:20.976 --> 14:22.509
I think
I got five families members

14:22.511 --> 14:24.745
who want to know
why their loved ones are dead.

14:24.747 --> 14:26.847
And you're
wasting time.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.585
To be continued.

14:31.587 --> 14:33.253
Both of you.

14:33.255 --> 14:35.322
I was looking through
your victims' tax filings,

14:35.324 --> 14:36.790
and I noticed something
in the log.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.926
Someone has already viewed them
from outside the agency.

14:38.928 --> 14:40.727
McGEE:
The IRS was hacked.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.396
Somebody was
combing through their files

14:42.398 --> 14:44.898
to find Navy sailors who were
late paying their taxes.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.366
I have no idea what it means.

14:46.368 --> 14:48.969
But, hopefully, you can find
some answers at that tax office.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.271
Ugh! You-- hot lips--

14:51.273 --> 14:52.306
let's go. You're done.

14:53.175 --> 14:54.741
Oh, uh, actually, there's

14:54.743 --> 14:56.944
something else.

14:59.582 --> 15:02.049
It-it would mean a lot
if you could be there.

15:02.051 --> 15:04.785
What is wrong with you?

15:04.787 --> 15:06.920
Can't leave you alone
for five minutes.

15:06.922 --> 15:08.589
What you got, boss?

15:10.993 --> 15:12.626
It is a wedding invitation.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.732
That's a rough one.

15:21.236 --> 15:23.804
Hello? Anyone home?

15:23.806 --> 15:26.139
Back door is locked.

15:26.141 --> 15:28.709
Building manager came by.

15:28.711 --> 15:31.011
Said that the tenant
recently changed the locks,

15:31.013 --> 15:32.779
but we were free
to pick it.

15:35.718 --> 15:37.684
McGEE:
NCIS!

15:40.422 --> 15:41.855
Not exactly H&R Block.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.256
Manager say anything else?

15:43.258 --> 15:45.626
McGEE: Said the guy that rented
the place paid in cash.

15:45.628 --> 15:48.695
Gave me a description and, uh,
what sounded like a fake name.

15:48.697 --> 15:53.266
Well, whoever rented this place
definitely wanted their privacy.

15:53.268 --> 15:55.302
Speaking of which,

15:55.304 --> 15:58.672
uh, sorry I walked in
on you and Rebecca, boss.

15:58.674 --> 16:01.775
You going to the wedding?

16:01.777 --> 16:03.276
No.

16:03.278 --> 16:05.012
Don't blame you.

16:05.014 --> 16:07.514
I'm sure the guy she's, uh,
marrying isn't too happy

16:07.516 --> 16:08.615
you were even invited.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.984
Even less so if he found out
that you two...

16:13.822 --> 16:16.156
You two what?

16:16.158 --> 16:18.225
Innocently slept
all night long,

16:18.227 --> 16:20.727
butt-to-front,
totally innocently?

16:20.729 --> 16:22.062
You got something to say?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.430
No! No, no, no.

16:23.432 --> 16:25.332
I-I wasn't being sarcastic
at all, boss.

16:25.334 --> 16:27.000
I'm just saying
because it, you know...

16:27.002 --> 16:29.102
it looked like you two were...

16:29.104 --> 16:32.305
I mean...

16:34.009 --> 16:34.903
What's that?

16:34.928 --> 16:36.779
What, another cat
in trouble, McGee?

16:36.779 --> 16:39.579
No. Boss, look.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.820
Somebody fired
a weapon in here.

17:03.338 --> 17:05.005
McGEE:
It's blood.

17:05.007 --> 17:07.607
Somebody tried to clean it up,
but it's definitely blood.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.176
I'll get the lights
in the car.

17:15.884 --> 17:19.019
What the hell
happened in here?

17:20.521 --> 17:22.622
Heard you have some good
news and some bad news.

17:22.624 --> 17:26.292
Actually, I have weird news,
and I have weirder news.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.995
Well, I will take it. All anyone
can talk about upstairs is...

17:28.997 --> 17:30.530
The slumber party
at Gibbs' house.

17:30.532 --> 17:32.199
News travels fast.

17:32.201 --> 17:33.900
Gibbsonian News, even faster.

17:33.902 --> 17:36.169
But I am not gonna
get involved.

17:36.171 --> 17:37.637
Hmm.
I ran DNA

17:37.639 --> 17:38.972
on the blood samples
that McGee

17:38.974 --> 17:40.941
brought back
from the tax office.

17:40.943 --> 17:42.843
Isolated five victims.

17:42.845 --> 17:44.411
They're the same victims

17:44.413 --> 17:45.846
from the shootout
at the diner.

17:45.848 --> 17:46.947
That's weird.

17:46.949 --> 17:48.081
Told you.
How did

17:48.083 --> 17:50.250
our diner victims
get into a shootout

17:50.252 --> 17:52.686
halfway across town
after losing that much blood?

17:52.688 --> 17:54.321
They didn't.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.891
I think the shootout
at the diner was staged.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.259
I ran GSR

17:59.261 --> 18:01.294
on the victims' hands
and clothing.

18:01.296 --> 18:02.229
It's negative.

18:02.231 --> 18:03.964
None of them fired
a single bullet.

18:03.966 --> 18:05.165
You're right.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.266
That's weirder.

18:06.268 --> 18:08.435
Yeah. I think
that the victims were lured

18:08.437 --> 18:10.103
to the tax office and killed,

18:10.105 --> 18:12.339
and then, their bodies
were brought to the diner

18:12.341 --> 18:16.143
and set up like-like mannequins
in a store display.

18:16.145 --> 18:17.644
Why would anyone do that?

18:17.646 --> 18:20.180
No idea. I'm still trying to
figure what Gibbs is thinking,

18:20.182 --> 18:22.015
shacking up
with his ex-wife. I mean,

18:22.017 --> 18:24.951
there's no way that he knew
she was engaged, right?

18:24.953 --> 18:26.553
I thought you weren't
getting involved.

18:26.555 --> 18:27.821
You bought that?

18:27.823 --> 18:30.290
I don't think they shacked up.

18:30.292 --> 18:32.459
I heard they still
had their clothes on.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.161
Okay, that's not what I heard.

18:34.163 --> 18:35.829
What'd you hear?
I heard...

18:35.831 --> 18:37.864
Hold that thought.

18:37.866 --> 18:39.132
Bishop.

18:40.803 --> 18:43.370
Okay. Yeah, be right there.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.739
What is it?
Well, we haven't finished one case,

18:45.741 --> 18:47.541
and we already have another one.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.176
But give me some gossip
for the road.

18:52.648 --> 18:55.849
Master Chief Ekim Beanes.

18:55.851 --> 18:58.251
The neighbors saw him lying
on the street; called 911.

18:58.253 --> 18:59.886
Paramedics tried
to revive him,

18:59.888 --> 19:01.221
but he lost
too much blood.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.455
Ducky's not here yet,

19:02.457 --> 19:04.624
but it looks like a single
stab wound to the chest.

19:04.626 --> 19:07.127
Probably bled out pretty quickly.
Witnesses?

19:07.129 --> 19:09.062
Some of the neighbors thought
they might have heard an argument.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.198
What do you think,
a robbery?

19:11.200 --> 19:12.399
Doesn't appear.

19:20.609 --> 19:22.375
- No.
- Yeah, that's wife number two.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.643
Really?

19:23.645 --> 19:25.679
I'm telling you...
Hey!

19:25.681 --> 19:27.013
You got something to say?

19:27.015 --> 19:29.416
Uh, not in
a million years.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.253
Actually,

19:33.255 --> 19:35.422
I just want you to know
I understand completely.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.224
I do.
There's nothing

19:37.226 --> 19:38.758
more enticing
than forbidden fruit,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.527
especially the kind
you can spoon with.

19:40.529 --> 19:42.562
That was...

19:42.564 --> 19:43.930
I didn't...
I shouldn't have said that.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.265
That's a bad mouth.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.533
McGee...

19:46.535 --> 19:47.968
Boss, I did not
say anything.

19:47.970 --> 19:49.603
I-I don't know how everyone
seems to know.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.670
Know what?

19:50.672 --> 19:52.205
There is nothing to
know. You got that?

19:52.207 --> 19:53.740
McGEE:
Got it.

19:53.742 --> 19:55.508
Uh, Gibbs?

19:55.510 --> 19:56.710
What?

19:56.712 --> 19:58.378
Found something
in the victim's pocket.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.347
You need to see this.

20:01.516 --> 20:04.451
That's the same card one
of our diner victims had.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.186
These murders are connected.

20:06.188 --> 20:08.755
In fact, it was so hard
to remember

20:08.757 --> 20:10.824
what happened
to Henry VIII's wives

20:10.826 --> 20:13.059
that as children
we had a mnemonic.

20:13.061 --> 20:14.728
Divorced, beheaded, died,

20:14.730 --> 20:16.763
divorced, beheaded, survived.

20:16.765 --> 20:21.835
Yes. And with Jethro's
mystery wife back on the scene,

20:21.837 --> 20:23.536
we're gonna need
something similar.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.274
Hello, Jethro!

20:27.276 --> 20:29.109
I'm afraid your visit
is somewhat premature.

20:29.111 --> 20:30.911
The only thing
we've done so far

20:30.913 --> 20:31.878
is the X rays.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.647
I just wanted a second look.
Yeah.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.248
There's something
about this one, isn't there?

20:35.250 --> 20:36.516
It's familiar
somehow.

20:36.518 --> 20:38.985
I had the same feeling
when I saw the murder weapon.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.820
You've got the murder weapon?

20:40.822 --> 20:43.323
Maybe. Paramedics
just dropped this off.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.225
A trainee accidently grabbed it

20:45.227 --> 20:46.559
during the
resuscitation attempt,

20:46.561 --> 20:48.161
thought it was part
of their field kit.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.996
It matches the wound,

20:49.998 --> 20:51.431
both in shape
and size.

20:56.972 --> 20:58.838
Mike.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.173
Mike Franks.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.876
He was wounded
in the exact same manner.

21:02.878 --> 21:04.177
About the same age, too.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.578
Also, he was
left to die

21:05.580 --> 21:07.981
in the middle
of the street.

21:07.983 --> 21:09.983
That's a lot of coincidences.

21:11.954 --> 21:13.653
No, it's not.

21:13.655 --> 21:15.155
Jimmy had told me

21:15.157 --> 21:17.324
that something
felt familiar

21:17.326 --> 21:18.391
about this victim.

21:18.393 --> 21:20.026
And I've had
the same nagging feeling

21:20.028 --> 21:23.063
about the fake shootout
at the diner.

21:28.003 --> 21:29.803
Look familiar?

21:29.805 --> 21:32.005
It's our crime scene sketch.
Yes.

21:32.007 --> 21:33.373
But not from yesterday.

21:33.909 --> 21:35.008
This...

21:35.010 --> 21:37.010
is from the diner

21:37.012 --> 21:39.412
where Director Shepard
was killed.

21:39.414 --> 21:44.818
This... is our
latest crime sketch.

21:46.288 --> 21:48.521
<i>Our male victims surrounded</i>
<i>our female victim.</i>

21:48.523 --> 21:50.991
<i>She was here.</i>

21:50.993 --> 21:52.192
<i>She got off the first shot.</i>

21:52.194 --> 21:55.261
<i>Male number one</i>
<i>never even fired his weapon.</i>

21:55.263 --> 21:57.530
<i>Captain Hanover took on</i>
<i>heavy fire after that,</i>

21:57.532 --> 21:59.132
<i>one to the shoulder,</i>
<i>one to the arm.</i>

21:59.134 --> 22:00.600
<i>She kept firing.</i>

22:00.602 --> 22:01.835
<i>Took out male number two</i>

22:01.837 --> 22:04.938
<i>and male number three.</i>

22:04.940 --> 22:06.306
<i>Then she dropped to one knee,</i>

22:06.308 --> 22:09.209
<i>fired three more shots,</i>
<i>took out male number four.</i>

22:09.211 --> 22:12.078
<i>And by then she had lost</i>
<i>too much blood.</i>

22:14.182 --> 22:18.518
Well, that is most certainly
not a coincidence.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.555
Someone is recreating murders
from your past, Gibbs.

22:22.557 --> 22:24.758
Why?

22:35.502 --> 22:38.168
Five bodies turn up,
staged to mirror the gunfight

22:38.169 --> 22:40.436
that killed Director Shepard
in California.

22:40.438 --> 22:41.637
Then another
body appears,

22:41.639 --> 22:43.906
this time mirroring
Mike Franks' murder.

22:43.908 --> 22:45.674
Both were NCIS.

22:45.676 --> 22:47.209
Both pivotal figures
in your life.

22:47.211 --> 22:48.677
Somebody's gaslighting you,
boss.

22:48.679 --> 22:50.012
You think?

22:50.014 --> 22:52.181
I want to know why.

22:52.183 --> 22:55.217
Uh, no theories yet but we
have a few angles on suspects.

22:55.219 --> 22:57.920
The record from Director
Shepard's murder was sealed.

22:57.922 --> 23:00.456
Only a small group of
people had the details.

23:00.458 --> 23:03.525
And we will talk
to each one of them.

23:03.527 --> 23:05.928
And then there's...

23:05.930 --> 23:08.564
Then there's what?

23:12.436 --> 23:14.036
What?

23:14.038 --> 23:17.072
These murders
are all very personal to you

23:17.074 --> 23:18.874
and...

23:18.876 --> 23:20.876
occurred when someone else...

23:20.878 --> 23:22.878
personal showed up.

23:24.181 --> 23:27.016
Your ex-wife.
Rebecca?

23:27.018 --> 23:28.651
Yeah.

23:28.653 --> 23:30.185
Rebecca isn't involved.

23:30.187 --> 23:31.553
McGEE:
Boss, you got to admit,

23:31.555 --> 23:33.255
the timing's kind
of interesting.

23:33.257 --> 23:35.291
Look, look, look.

23:35.293 --> 23:38.427
She is totally unstable,

23:38.429 --> 23:40.796
completely
disrespectful...

23:41.532 --> 23:44.500
...untrustworthy-- she's a liar.

23:44.502 --> 23:46.435
But she's no killer.

23:46.437 --> 23:48.170
Show him.

23:49.407 --> 23:52.374
McGEE: Three months ago,
a large deposit was made

23:52.376 --> 23:54.677
to her savings account
from an offshore bank.

23:54.679 --> 23:56.712
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

23:56.714 --> 23:58.080
You are talking
about a woman

23:58.082 --> 24:00.349
who doesn't know
how to run a dishwasher.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.817
Show him.

24:01.819 --> 24:05.254
I tracerouted the IP address
that was used to hack the IRS.

24:05.256 --> 24:07.056
Boss, it belongs to Rebecca.

24:07.058 --> 24:09.258
We aren't saying
she's the mastermind,

24:09.260 --> 24:10.292
but she's involved.

24:10.294 --> 24:12.227
Oh, man.

24:12.229 --> 24:15.464
I picked a really bad time
to stop drinking coffee.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.667
You know,
this is harassment.

24:18.669 --> 24:20.002
My fiancé's a lawyer.

24:20.004 --> 24:21.837
You're gonna be scrubbing
toilets at the National Mall

24:21.839 --> 24:23.105
when he gets through
with you.

24:23.107 --> 24:25.007
And then...

24:25.009 --> 24:26.475
it's my turn.

24:33.784 --> 24:35.150
You never change,
do you?

24:35.152 --> 24:37.286
Sit down.

24:38.856 --> 24:40.923
Please.

24:40.925 --> 24:43.759
Well, that was the most awkward
car ride of my life.

24:43.761 --> 24:45.761
I need a Milk Dud.

24:46.797 --> 24:48.864
Guess you didn't get enough
the other night, huh?

24:48.866 --> 24:49.932
Oh, snap.

24:49.934 --> 24:51.734
This feels
really wrong.

24:51.736 --> 24:53.569
You can always leave.

24:53.571 --> 24:54.970
You joking?

24:55.906 --> 24:57.439
Sorry I'm late.

24:57.441 --> 24:59.508
Don't say another word. M...

25:00.978 --> 25:02.745
Jethro.

25:06.150 --> 25:08.784
Been a long time.

25:17.161 --> 25:18.427
What's he doing here?

25:19.363 --> 25:20.763
He's my lawyer.

25:22.466 --> 25:24.099
What, my fiancé
can't be my lawyer?

25:24.101 --> 25:25.401
You two are getting married?

25:25.403 --> 25:27.136
Did you even read
the invitation?

25:27.138 --> 25:28.370
Invitation?

25:28.372 --> 25:30.372
You invited him
to our wedding?

25:30.374 --> 25:31.874
We talked about this.

25:31.876 --> 25:34.196
Yeah, but I didn't think you'd
actually go through with it.

25:34.645 --> 25:36.011
Not that I have anything
against you.

25:36.013 --> 25:37.212
I'm the one who...
I mean...

25:37.214 --> 25:38.480
I didn't know.

25:39.650 --> 25:40.616
I-I told you,

25:40.618 --> 25:42.818
I-I had no idea
she was married.

25:42.820 --> 25:44.853
Shut the front door--
it's him.

25:44.855 --> 25:46.355
I-I really didn't know.

25:46.357 --> 25:48.490
I will even sign
an affidavit if you'd like.

25:48.492 --> 25:50.225
The... I mean...

25:50.227 --> 25:51.660
I-I didn't know.

25:54.265 --> 25:56.732
There goes
the coffee restriction.

26:03.033 --> 26:04.827
What do you want to talk
to my client about?

26:05.376 --> 26:07.376
$300,000.

26:07.378 --> 26:09.044
From an offshore bank.

26:09.046 --> 26:10.979
Don't answer that.

26:12.883 --> 26:14.783
Okay, let's try
something else.

26:16.187 --> 26:17.753
Where were you
two nights ago?

26:17.755 --> 26:19.788
Were you at home?

26:19.790 --> 26:22.090
Or did you sleep
someplace else?

26:22.092 --> 26:23.625
By chance.

26:23.627 --> 26:25.828
He's fishing.

26:25.830 --> 26:27.930
Yeah, wait until you
see what I catch.

26:32.036 --> 26:34.036
Uncle Mel died.

26:34.038 --> 26:35.304
Ah...
Gene, stop.

26:35.306 --> 26:38.407
He left me the money, I
can show you the will.

26:38.409 --> 26:40.175
Is that it?

26:42.480 --> 26:43.612
Oh.

26:43.614 --> 26:45.013
Someone...
God.

26:45.015 --> 26:47.783
hacked their
IRS accounts.

26:49.386 --> 26:50.719
We traced it
back to you.

26:50.721 --> 26:53.155
You think
I hacked the IRS?

26:53.157 --> 26:54.590
Me?

26:54.592 --> 26:56.024
Have you chipped
your sander?

26:56.026 --> 26:57.392
You could have
paid someone.

26:58.496 --> 27:00.829
This all started the
day you showed up.

27:00.831 --> 27:02.393
Oh, rule 39.

27:02.394 --> 27:03.446
There's no such thing
as coincidences, right?

27:03.470 --> 27:04.934
That's right.

27:04.935 --> 27:06.468
First of all,
I gave you that rule.

27:06.470 --> 27:08.070
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

27:08.072 --> 27:09.771
And second of all,
use your head, J.

27:09.773 --> 27:11.406
I'm clearly being
set up here.

27:11.408 --> 27:14.109
Obviously, someone knew
that I was coming to see you.

27:14.111 --> 27:16.378
That's your lead,
not me.

27:18.415 --> 27:20.215
Well, look at that.

27:20.217 --> 27:21.884
It's not sophisticated,

27:21.886 --> 27:24.419
but she was right.

27:24.421 --> 27:28.090
Somebody did know that
Rebecca was going to see Gibbs.

27:28.092 --> 27:29.391
Her cell phone
is bugged.

27:29.393 --> 27:32.427
She and Diane have been texting
about Gibbs for weeks.

27:32.429 --> 27:33.595
Can you trace the bug?

27:33.597 --> 27:35.664
It's pretty unique.

27:35.666 --> 27:37.766
So I uploaded
the schematics

27:37.768 --> 27:39.501
into the FBI's ViCAP database

27:39.503 --> 27:42.738
to see if it had been used
in other crimes. No hits, yet.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.840
I'm gonna need to see
the texts to Diane.

27:44.842 --> 27:47.242
: That is
so not happening.

27:47.244 --> 27:48.577
It's for work, Abbs.

27:50.381 --> 27:51.647
Come on.

27:51.649 --> 27:53.649
You know you want
to understand

27:53.651 --> 27:56.285
why wife number two would just
suddenly appear out of the blue.

27:56.287 --> 27:58.287
<i>I</i> already know.

27:58.289 --> 28:00.022
And you really
don't want to know.

28:00.024 --> 28:01.323
Why not?

28:01.325 --> 28:03.759
Because... it's sad.

28:03.761 --> 28:05.961
Oh, no.
What kind of sad?

28:05.963 --> 28:07.396
None of your business
kind of sad.

28:07.398 --> 28:08.597
Well, I already know

28:08.599 --> 28:10.499
that Rebecca cheated on Gibbs
when they were married.

28:10.501 --> 28:13.001
I also know that she's marrying
the guy she cheated with.

28:14.038 --> 28:15.337
Oh.

28:15.339 --> 28:16.705
You just told me
everything.

28:16.707 --> 28:17.707
Thank you, Abbs.

28:17.708 --> 28:19.374
I did not.

28:19.376 --> 28:21.043
Rebecca wants
to make amends.

28:21.045 --> 28:23.579
She's here to get
Gibbs' approval for her wedding.

28:23.581 --> 28:25.147
How on earth did
you know that?

28:25.149 --> 28:26.582
I'm a trained
investigator.

28:26.584 --> 28:30.419
Plus, let's be honest,
everyone wants Gibbs' approval.

28:32.489 --> 28:34.189
I got a hit on the bug.

28:34.191 --> 28:36.124
Okay, so it was used

28:36.126 --> 28:39.962
in an unsolved espionage case
two years ago.

28:39.964 --> 28:42.764
Interpol is looking
at this guy.

28:42.766 --> 28:45.000
Ghenna Ulanov.

28:45.002 --> 28:46.435
He's a Russian mercenary

28:46.437 --> 28:49.871
but has had a U.S. address
for the past year.

28:49.873 --> 28:51.239
Never heard of him.

28:52.276 --> 28:54.376
Oh, no.

28:55.679 --> 28:57.412
Looks like he's worked
with Sergei Mishnev.

28:57.414 --> 29:00.449
Number One with a bullet
on our Most Wanted Wall.

29:00.451 --> 29:03.018
And Gibbs' personal
basement wall.

29:03.020 --> 29:05.087
Well, I hate
to quote rule 39,

29:05.089 --> 29:07.322
but that is definitely
not a coincidence.

29:09.026 --> 29:11.994
McGEE: Doesn't look like
anyone's home, boss.

29:13.597 --> 29:15.030
Sergei's going to an
awful lot of trouble.

29:15.032 --> 29:16.498
I wonder what kind
of game he's playing.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.833
McGEE:
Moving in.

29:18.602 --> 29:20.569
All right, let's go.

29:37.921 --> 29:39.721
NCIS.

29:46.196 --> 29:49.097
No way he jumped out
any windows.

29:49.099 --> 29:50.599
Whoa.

29:50.601 --> 29:52.467
Is that your ex-wife?

29:52.469 --> 29:54.136
Looks like she's been
under surveillance

29:54.138 --> 29:55.303
for weeks.

30:03.447 --> 30:06.081
Hey, I'm right in the middle
of something here.

30:06.083 --> 30:07.716
I know what's going on.

30:07.718 --> 30:08.984
What?

30:08.986 --> 30:10.285
Can't talk over the phone.

30:10.287 --> 30:12.254
I'm texting you an address;
meet me in a half hour.

30:12.256 --> 30:13.488
Iron Lady, out.

30:13.490 --> 30:15.791
Boss, she does realize
she's an IRS agent,

30:15.793 --> 30:16.793
not CIA?

30:16.794 --> 30:18.393
McGee, Bishop,
tear this place apart.

30:18.395 --> 30:19.461
DiNozzo,

30:19.463 --> 30:20.662
find Rebecca.

30:20.664 --> 30:22.497
Bring her in for
protective custody.

30:22.499 --> 30:24.833
And you know what?

30:24.835 --> 30:26.334
Gene, too.

30:26.336 --> 30:28.170
Where you going?

30:28.172 --> 30:31.039
To talk to Mata Hari.

30:33.077 --> 30:35.343
Hey.

30:35.345 --> 30:37.179
What the hell took you so long?

30:37.181 --> 30:40.649
Thank goodness I have
this lovely view to enjoy.

30:40.651 --> 30:41.483
What's going on?

30:41.485 --> 30:42.951
What do you mean?

30:43.854 --> 30:46.188
You said you knew
what was going on.

30:46.190 --> 30:47.355
When?

30:47.357 --> 30:49.424
Diane.

30:49.426 --> 30:50.826
Why are we here?

30:50.828 --> 30:52.360
Well, you tell me.

30:52.362 --> 30:53.428
I'm in the middle
of getting a manicure,

30:53.430 --> 30:54.496
and I get this cryptic text

30:54.498 --> 30:55.964
from you to meet you

30:55.966 --> 30:57.733
up on the top of this parking lot.
Come on, we got to go.

30:57.735 --> 30:58.867
We got to go right now.
What? Why? Why?

30:58.869 --> 31:00.068
Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

31:11.348 --> 31:13.849
Only the beginning, my friend.

31:33.139 --> 31:34.372
Road blocks
at every intersection

31:34.374 --> 31:35.406
in a two-mile radius.

31:35.408 --> 31:37.241
And I want air support
if you got it.

31:40.546 --> 31:41.779
We got to go.

31:41.781 --> 31:43.080
<i>We got to go right now. Come on.</i>
<i>Why? Why?</i>

31:54.527 --> 31:56.327
NCIS!

31:56.329 --> 31:57.661
Everybody get down!

32:11.310 --> 32:13.477
FBI and Homeland Security
are on high alert.

32:13.479 --> 32:14.979
I want agents at every
train station

32:14.981 --> 32:16.647
and airport from here
to the Atlantic.

32:16.649 --> 32:18.215
On it.
Where's Leon?

32:18.217 --> 32:20.484
Director Vance is flying back
from his conference.

32:20.486 --> 32:22.386
Okay, get me SECNAV,

32:22.388 --> 32:23.687
get me DNI.

32:24.824 --> 32:27.057
Find Fornell and Emily,
wherever they are.

32:27.059 --> 32:28.793
Gibbs, I'm so sorry.

32:28.795 --> 32:29.795
McGee?

32:29.796 --> 32:31.595
Ducky and Jimmy are bringing
the body in.

32:31.597 --> 32:32.863
What about the sniper nest?

32:32.865 --> 32:34.331
Tony's on it.
So far, nothing useful,

32:34.333 --> 32:35.699
but we have something.

32:35.701 --> 32:38.102
Found it in the RV
after you left.

32:38.104 --> 32:40.538
It's a motion sensor wired
to a hidden laptop.

32:40.540 --> 32:42.706
It's set to call your cell
when someone entered,

32:42.708 --> 32:43.808
then play this recording.

32:43.810 --> 32:45.242
I know what's going on.

32:45.244 --> 32:46.644
Can't talk over the phone.

32:46.646 --> 32:48.779
I'm texting you an address;
meet me in a half hour.

32:48.781 --> 32:50.381
Iron Lady, out.

32:50.383 --> 32:51.916
Ran it through
voice analysis.

32:51.918 --> 32:53.984
It's a good approximation, but it's not Diane.
I know.

32:53.986 --> 32:55.786
Sergei wanted us
to find that RV, boss.

32:55.788 --> 32:56.987
Yeah, I know.

32:56.989 --> 32:58.489
Just spoke with the FBI.

32:58.491 --> 32:59.590
Fornell's in
a classified briefing.

32:59.592 --> 33:00.624
I didn't leave a message.

33:00.626 --> 33:01.959
There anything else
on the computer?

33:01.961 --> 33:04.361
Yeah, one more recording,
and this one's for you.

33:06.165 --> 33:08.365
Hello, Agent Gibbs.

33:08.367 --> 33:10.434
You are a hard nut to crack,

33:10.436 --> 33:13.170
as you Americans like to say.

33:13.172 --> 33:15.406
I left you all the clues.

33:15.408 --> 33:18.309
You really should've
seen it coming.

33:20.680 --> 33:23.113
That has to sting.

33:24.584 --> 33:26.750
You mess with my family,

33:26.752 --> 33:28.118
I mess with yours.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.387
Check,

33:30.389 --> 33:32.289
Agent Gibbs.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.492
We're not sure
what family he's referring to.

33:34.494 --> 33:36.460
No kids we know of.

33:36.462 --> 33:37.628
His father's Russian.

33:37.630 --> 33:39.463
Interpol thinks
his mother's Palestinian.

33:39.465 --> 33:40.931
They're sending
over the file.

33:40.933 --> 33:42.933
But it's the check
that makes me most nervous.

33:42.935 --> 33:46.537
Usually it means
a checkmate's coming.

33:52.011 --> 33:53.844
All right, on three.

33:53.846 --> 33:56.080
One, two...

33:56.082 --> 33:57.982
No.

33:57.984 --> 33:59.717
I beg your pardon?

33:59.719 --> 34:01.685
No. I...

34:01.687 --> 34:04.255
I don't want to.

34:06.092 --> 34:08.792
You don't want to what,
Mr. Palmer?

34:11.496 --> 34:13.964
I don't want to know how
much her liver weighs.

34:15.768 --> 34:18.636
I don't want to catalog
her scars.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.042
But most of all, I don't want
to cut open another friend.

34:31.751 --> 34:33.918
I think I've had my limit.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.891
I don't remember the moment

34:40.893 --> 34:42.326
when I reached my limit,

34:42.328 --> 34:43.793
but I do remember

34:43.795 --> 34:46.163
never being the same.

34:50.303 --> 34:52.268
Would you like to see her?

35:00.379 --> 35:02.012
You never loved me.

35:02.014 --> 35:04.715
I liked you.

35:04.717 --> 35:06.917
I still do.

35:09.522 --> 35:12.022
But the only woman
you'll ever love is Shannon.

35:13.693 --> 35:15.693
You were my Shannon, Leroy.

35:26.172 --> 35:27.771
I'll give you a moment.

35:27.773 --> 35:29.540
No.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.847
Have you told Fornell?

35:36.849 --> 35:38.282
No, I'm gonna do that in person.

35:38.284 --> 35:40.117
I just wanted to talk to you.

35:40.119 --> 35:41.218
Me?

35:41.220 --> 35:44.021
What the hell
is this guy doing, Ducky?

35:44.023 --> 35:45.689
Sergei Mishnev.

35:47.460 --> 35:51.495
Appears he's playing
a somewhat macabre game.

35:51.497 --> 35:54.164
Though, if we're lucky,

35:54.166 --> 35:58.602
it may actually be part
of a master plan.

35:58.604 --> 36:00.504
Lucky?

36:00.506 --> 36:02.806
A plan we can anticipate,
deal with,

36:02.808 --> 36:04.775
stop. Yeah.

36:04.777 --> 36:08.445
Even if it's just a plan
to kill you.

36:08.447 --> 36:11.482
But I fear something worse.

36:11.484 --> 36:14.118
Sergei wants to hurt you.

36:14.120 --> 36:16.754
It's clear he blames you
for something.

36:16.756 --> 36:19.590
Something that wounded him
to the core.

36:19.592 --> 36:21.392
And now it's payback time.

36:21.394 --> 36:25.329
But killing you
is inadequate.

36:25.331 --> 36:27.698
He wants to see you suffer.

36:27.700 --> 36:30.734
Which means that
all bets are off

36:30.736 --> 36:32.503
on what might come next

36:32.505 --> 36:34.872
or for whom he might come.

36:36.842 --> 36:38.976
Gibbs?

36:38.978 --> 36:41.145
Abby, you got something?

36:42.081 --> 36:44.481
I figured out
how Sergei knew

36:44.483 --> 36:46.950
all the classified details
of Director Shepard's death.

36:46.952 --> 36:49.153
It was the virus
that I.T. Kevin made for him.

36:49.155 --> 36:52.056
It didn't just wreak havoc
on our computer systems.

36:52.058 --> 36:53.957
It stole from them.

36:53.959 --> 36:56.026
What'd he get?
Your personnel file.

36:56.028 --> 36:58.328
Records on everyone
you've worked with.

36:58.330 --> 37:00.931
I'm still compiling
a list of the data

37:00.933 --> 37:02.900
that was sent to...

37:04.537 --> 37:06.070
Stroke of genius!

37:06.072 --> 37:07.304
Lightbulb!

37:07.306 --> 37:09.106
Lightbulb over the head.

37:09.108 --> 37:11.575
I think I know
how to find Sergei.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.444
Or possibly kill us all.

37:13.446 --> 37:15.612
I'll let you know.

37:18.951 --> 37:20.551
Are you out of your mind?

37:20.553 --> 37:22.286
You want to release
Sergei's virus?

37:22.288 --> 37:23.487
Like a bad itch.

37:23.489 --> 37:25.022
When it gathers its Intel
and tries to phone home,

37:25.024 --> 37:26.323
we can trace it back to Sergei.

37:26.325 --> 37:27.325
In theory.

37:27.326 --> 37:28.826
Do you remember what happened
last time?

37:28.828 --> 37:30.294
It blew out all of our systems.

37:30.296 --> 37:33.097
The furnace overheated,
almost burned down the building.

37:33.099 --> 37:34.998
I've learned
from my mistakes, okay?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.233
I've been studying this virus.

37:36.235 --> 37:39.369
I think I can defang it
with this.

37:39.371 --> 37:41.138
It'll run, but it won't
have any teeth.

37:41.140 --> 37:43.073
Yeah, but you're defanging it
by spreading it out

37:43.075 --> 37:45.375
over the city's
transportation computing grid.

37:45.377 --> 37:46.443
It's the closest system

37:46.445 --> 37:48.212
with enough bandwidth
to handle the load.

37:48.214 --> 37:50.080
It'll be fine.
We need to test it.

37:50.082 --> 37:52.015
We don't have time.
Well, then we should call Gibbs.

37:52.017 --> 37:53.517
He just left to talk to Fornell.

37:53.519 --> 37:55.352
We need to leave Gibbs alone.

37:55.354 --> 37:56.453
Okay?

37:56.455 --> 37:58.689
Do you want to catch
this bastard or not?

38:01.227 --> 38:03.927
All right, let's do it.

38:13.205 --> 38:14.438
Talk to me.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.440
We have a lead on Sergei

38:16.442 --> 38:18.242
and possibly some trouble

38:18.244 --> 38:19.810
with the Department
of Transportation.

38:19.812 --> 38:22.479
McGEE: We used I.T. Kevin's virus
as a homing beacon

38:22.481 --> 38:25.149
then traced it to an apartment in the city.
Where?

38:25.151 --> 38:26.850
It's the building
next to where Diane was killed.

38:26.852 --> 38:27.985
Apartment 2E.

38:46.806 --> 38:48.605
<i>I'm not much for words.</i>

38:48.607 --> 38:50.240
<i>Most things are better</i>
<i>left unsaid.</i>

38:50.242 --> 38:51.575
<i>It'd be a lot easier</i>
<i>if I could just pick you up</i>

38:51.577 --> 38:53.277
<i>and we'd start running</i>
<i>and we'd never stop.</i>

38:53.279 --> 38:54.711
<i>But before I do,</i>

38:54.713 --> 38:56.413
<i>I just want to ask you</i>
<i>one thing.</i>

38:56.415 --> 38:58.215
Yes, I'll marry you.
<i>An opportunity to twist the knife in?</i>

38:58.217 --> 39:00.217
<i>No, that's your specialty.</i>

39:00.219 --> 39:01.685
Your way of getting even with me
for leaving you?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.787
<i>It wasn't easy being</i>
<i>a human anti-depressant.</i>

39:03.789 --> 39:05.489
<i>You didn't think I knew?</i>
<i>You just married me</i>

39:05.491 --> 39:06.557
to get over Shannon?

39:06.559 --> 39:07.758
<i>That's all I ever wanted.</i>

39:07.760 --> 39:09.660
<i>To wake up next</i>
<i>to someone I love.</i>

39:09.662 --> 39:11.929
<i>You were my Shannon, Leroy.</i>

39:11.931 --> 39:13.438
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go right now.

39:13.462 --> 39:14.833
Why? Why?

39:14.834 --> 39:15.966
<i>Hello, Agent Gibbs.</i>

39:15.968 --> 39:17.201
<i>You mess with my family,</i>

39:17.203 --> 39:18.569
<i>I mess with yours.</i>

39:21.307 --> 39:23.540
<i>I never meant to hurt you.</i>

39:31.750 --> 39:32.783
Well done, Agent Gibbs.

39:32.785 --> 39:34.451
You may have won this battle,

39:34.453 --> 39:36.086
but I assure you...

39:44.396 --> 39:46.597
Checkmate.

39:52.872 --> 39:54.304
<i>Boss?</i>

39:54.306 --> 39:56.306
Boss, can you hear me?

39:59.745 --> 40:01.578
Sergei?

40:01.580 --> 40:02.679
He got away.

40:02.681 --> 40:04.414
Thanks for waiting for us.

40:05.951 --> 40:07.084
Boss, you okay?

40:07.086 --> 40:08.252
No.

40:08.254 --> 40:09.486
Neither are we.

40:09.488 --> 40:10.721
They've got blueprints
for dozens

40:10.723 --> 40:13.090
of U.S. military installations
all over the place in there.

40:13.092 --> 40:14.391
It looks like they
tried to take them,

40:14.393 --> 40:16.093
but they left most
of them behind.

40:16.095 --> 40:17.294
Well, that's good.
That means whatever

40:17.296 --> 40:19.096
they were planning,
we stopped it.
