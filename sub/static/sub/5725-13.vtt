WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:08.209
MAN: The dates of my trip
have changed.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.645
I'm arriving in Tokyo
this Saturday,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.347
two days early,

00:13.381 --> 00:15.316
so I need to add
two more nights.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
The reservation
is under Andrew Michaels.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.454
Hello, are you there?

00:20.488 --> 00:21.655
(beeps)

00:21.689 --> 00:22.723
Hello?

00:22.756 --> 00:25.359
Ah...

00:29.363 --> 00:30.698
(tires squeal)

00:30.731 --> 00:32.666
Get off me. Don't touch me.
Come here, come here!

00:32.700 --> 00:34.368
Get off me, get off.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.104
I know what you did. Stop.

00:36.137 --> 00:36.804
(shouting)

00:36.837 --> 00:38.172
Hey!

00:38.206 --> 00:39.607
Hey, what are you doing?
Let her go!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.675
Come here.
Hey! Hey!

00:41.709 --> 00:42.643
This isn't your business.

00:42.676 --> 00:43.711
Get back in your car
and drive away, old man.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.780
I called 911, cops are gonna
be here any minute.

00:46.814 --> 00:47.848
This works out the best

00:47.881 --> 00:50.050
if you don't hurt her.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.826
Come on, come on. Yeah.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.361
(groans)
(engine starts)

01:00.394 --> 01:02.796
(tires squealing)

01:02.830 --> 01:04.232
Are you okay?

01:04.265 --> 01:06.467
Other than always picking
the wrong guy, yeah.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.269
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, ow.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.337
Okay... all right, come on.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.738
I'll give you a ride.
Come on.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.540
I can just wait
for the cops.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.643
Well, no cell service.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.644
(chuckles)

01:16.677 --> 01:17.811
Come on.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.380
Here we go.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.649
Yeah, let me clear
that out, first.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.456
MUNDO: Finally got Mangle
to talk, huh?

01:28.489 --> 01:29.490
More accurately,
got him to spit it out.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.591
He slipped

01:30.624 --> 01:31.692
the microchip into his mouth

01:31.725 --> 01:32.760
when the agents arrived.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.662
That's why
he refused to speak.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.230
And here I thought we'd
finally found a black hat

01:36.264 --> 01:38.299
smart enough to shut up
until his lawyer arrived.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.567
(phone buzzing)

01:40.268 --> 01:42.136
Agent Avery Ryan.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.272
Dr. Avery Ryan?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.207
I no longer practice.
Who is this?

01:46.240 --> 01:49.510
Your husband
is Andrew Michaels.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.779
My ex-husband. Who is this?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.447
You're listed
as a primary beneficiary

01:53.481 --> 01:56.384
on Mr. Michaels'
life insurance policy.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.487
His life insurance?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.589
Why would I...

02:02.656 --> 02:04.925
Is Andrew all right?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.561
Oh, Dr. Ryan, I-I'm so sorry.

02:07.595 --> 02:10.298
(sighs)

02:10.331 --> 02:11.799
I'm reaching out to you

02:11.832 --> 02:13.734
to pay off his life insurance.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.835
You're his beneficiary.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.604
Hello, Dr....

02:19.873 --> 02:22.810
I don't know,
they-they-they just called me.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.512
They-they told me that he died,

02:24.545 --> 02:26.247
I-I don't even know
how he died.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.648
(crying)

02:27.681 --> 02:29.783
Come here, come here.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.787
I'm sorry.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.390
I'll make some phone calls
to find out what I can.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.326
Thanks.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.496
WOMAN: You have reached
the architectural firm

02:42.530 --> 02:44.198
of Michaels
and Brochman Design.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.499
If you know your...
(phone beeps)

02:45.533 --> 02:47.535
Hey, it's Laura,
leave a message.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.271
Laura, this is Avery Ryan.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.273
I-I just heard
about your brother.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.308
(sobbing)

02:55.309 --> 02:56.744
Hello, hello.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.780
This is
Deputy Director Avery Ryan.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.814
No, no, no.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.583
Please don't put me on hold!

03:02.616 --> 03:04.685
I don't even know
what happened to him.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.654
I'm his ex-wife.
Don't transfer me again.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.188
I've been transferred 15 times!

03:08.989 --> 03:10.791
I tried to call
his next-of-kin.

03:10.824 --> 03:11.892
I'll call back.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.265
Avery?

03:18.266 --> 03:19.733
Not right now, Nelson.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.769
I'm sorry, I can't.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.571
Okay.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.939
Guys, let's get back to work.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.477
She's gonna be all right,
she's gonna be okay.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.451
Avery?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.652
When you're ready,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.688
an agent will take you home.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.897
I never stopped loving him.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.601
I had this fantasy
that we were gonna...

03:53.634 --> 03:56.036
(sniffles)

03:56.069 --> 03:58.806
...get back together, try again.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.842
(sighs)
But now he's gone.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.611
Hannah's gone.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.781
I no longer practice psychiatry.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.818
It's like that whole part
of my life is just over.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.557
I'm so sorry,

04:16.590 --> 04:18.859
but I want you to know,

04:18.892 --> 04:20.894
you're not alone.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.803
A man claiming
to be Andrew Michaels

04:29.837 --> 04:31.071
just called the FBI.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.940
He's being held at customs

04:32.973 --> 04:34.708
at JFK Airport.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.478
(chuckles) What?

04:45.853 --> 04:46.854
(sighs)

04:46.887 --> 04:49.557
(sighs) Hi.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.892
Ah, for a dead man,
you look pretty good.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.761
(laughs)
Come here.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.696
(kisses)

05:01.402 --> 05:02.603
Can you excuse us
for a second?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.937
Sure.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.741
Are you okay?

05:07.775 --> 05:10.511
(laughs) I should kill you.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.813
That phone call,

05:12.846 --> 05:13.914
I didn't see it coming.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.484
It really threw me.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.586
Hey, what is going on?

05:18.619 --> 05:19.887
I don't know.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.389
I didn't even know
I was the walking dead

05:21.422 --> 05:22.856
until I tried to go
through customs.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.426
(beeping)

05:25.459 --> 05:26.494
Where'd you get
this passport, sir?

05:26.527 --> 05:27.628
I applied for it.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.996
You're Andrew Michaels?

05:29.029 --> 05:31.365
Yes, is there a problem?

05:31.399 --> 05:32.566
Your passport's
been canceled.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.667
It says here,

05:33.701 --> 05:35.536
Andrew Michaels is dead.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.904
(laughs)

05:36.937 --> 05:37.838
Clearly, I'm alive.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.873
I'm standing right
in front of you. Hmm?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.675
I used the same passport
to get out of the--

05:41.709 --> 05:42.910
Sir?
Whoa, hold on.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.778
Obviously, there's been
a mistake made.

05:44.812 --> 05:45.913
Hey, whoa, wait a minute.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.415
I'm telling you--
let go... wait!
Sir.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.783
I threw a punch.

05:49.817 --> 05:50.984
I know, it was stupid.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.720
I just got off
a 14 hour flight.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.854
I'm tired, I'm cranky.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.155
You know how I get
when I get cranky.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.059
Yeah, I do, yeah, hmm.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.931
So what now?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.467
So, now, you're in my custody.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.438
Well, you're in the FBI custody,

06:10.471 --> 06:11.972
till we figure out

06:12.005 --> 06:12.906
what's going on.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.476
(sighs) I'll take it.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.710
RUSSELL: I know this
is gonna sound insane,

06:16.744 --> 06:17.978
but according
to the state of Connecticut

06:18.011 --> 06:20.981
Andrew Michaels
is officially deceased.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.015
So the death
certificate's real?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.551
Real as it gets.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.953
Legally, Andrew,
you can no longer vote,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.455
board an airplane, or obviously,

06:27.488 --> 06:29.022
try to re-enter the country.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.124
It's incredibly unsettling
to see this document

06:31.158 --> 06:32.560
with my name on it.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.827
Yeah, it wasn't
just your name.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.895
That thing was filled out

06:34.928 --> 06:35.929
with a lot
of personal information.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.164
Date of birth,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.700
social security number,
level of education.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.834
This thing was not a glitch.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.836
Somebody wanted you dead.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.806
Can you think
of any reason

06:45.839 --> 06:47.641
why someone would want
to target you?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.142
No, not really, uh...

06:49.176 --> 06:51.779
I mean, my life insurance
policy's pretty big,

06:51.812 --> 06:54.682
but the only person
to benefit from that is...

06:55.883 --> 06:57.518
Well, I didn't kill him.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.752
(chuckles)

06:58.786 --> 07:00.954
How does something
like this happen?

07:00.988 --> 07:02.122
Somebody found a way

07:02.155 --> 07:05.726
to hack into the electronic
death registration system,

07:05.759 --> 07:07.495
and based on what
we've been finding,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.463
he's not the only victim.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.931
So there's more?
Yeah, a lot more.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.099
We found over 200

07:12.132 --> 07:12.800
digital murders,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.568
and we've just started looking.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.969
I never even heard
of digital murder.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.037
Neither of I.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.072
I think we're looking
at a new hack here, Avery.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.942
Is this some new spin
on identity fraud?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.043
That's what
I thought, too,

07:23.076 --> 07:25.245
but a stolen identity,
you can recover.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.482
Currently, there's no clear way
to come back from the dead.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.485
All right, Andrew,
it's gonna be all right.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.854
I promise, we'll figure it out.

07:33.887 --> 07:34.988
You know, I'm gonna
leave you guys.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.123
The kids are working

07:36.156 --> 07:37.491
on your devices to find out

07:37.525 --> 07:38.959
if there was some kind
of intrusion.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.794
RYAN:
Thanks, D.B.
Yeah.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.764
We found a backdoor
on Andrew's laptop.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.733
Gave a black hat access
to everything,

07:45.766 --> 07:46.934
including Andrew's
personal information,

07:46.967 --> 07:48.001
and his credentials.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.970
Anything we can trace back
to a physical address?

07:50.003 --> 07:53.006
No, our hacker used a string of
proxy servers to stay anonymous.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.274
And we do know that
he didn't install

07:54.307 --> 07:56.243
the backdoor remotely,
he used a USB drive.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.946
So somebody had physical access
to Andrew's computer.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.947
Well, I'm
running the code

07:59.980 --> 08:00.781
from the hacker's backdoor

08:00.814 --> 08:01.915
through our
known exploit database.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.251
Black hats are just like
everyone else, they get lazy.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.153
They re-use
old code constantly.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.254
It saves time.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.556
(computer beeps)

08:09.757 --> 08:10.991
Got a hit.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.063
We've seen part
of this code before.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.165
This was written
by someone named

08:18.198 --> 08:19.533
Stella Kaine.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.134
Stella Kaine?
Yeah.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.036
I busted her five years ago
for hacking

08:23.070 --> 08:24.204
the East Cambridge University
network

08:24.237 --> 08:26.807
and faking admission letters.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.042
She's just a small-time
hacker-for-hire.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.678
Well, it looks like
she stepped up her game.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.945
So, let's go find Stella Kaine.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.080
* Slappin' like my subwoofer

08:33.113 --> 08:34.181
* Slidin' up to your house

08:34.214 --> 08:35.716
* Where your dogs at?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.918
* Fat beats for the kitty
from the other clap *

08:37.951 --> 08:39.620
* Hit up city, dancin' if you
need the fat checks *

08:39.653 --> 08:42.222
* Lootin' liquor stores,
I be flickin' match sticks *

08:42.255 --> 08:44.091
* Hit the town, flip the bird

08:44.124 --> 08:45.559
* Bust a ...,
make 'em swerve *

08:45.593 --> 08:47.060
* Bang, bang it to the curb

08:47.094 --> 08:48.662
* Oh, word, we absurd

08:48.696 --> 08:50.731
* Got that fire we can burn

08:50.764 --> 08:51.832
* Bang, bang it to the curb

08:51.865 --> 08:52.866
* Bang it to the curb

08:52.900 --> 08:53.934
* Bang it, bang it to the curb

08:53.967 --> 08:55.335
* Bang it to the curb

08:55.368 --> 08:56.770
* Bang it, bang it to the curb

08:56.804 --> 08:57.905
* Hit the town, flip the bird

08:57.938 --> 08:59.039
* Bust a ...,
make 'em swerve *

08:59.072 --> 09:02.142
* Bang, bang it to the curb...

09:05.078 --> 09:06.814
My drink!

09:06.847 --> 09:07.881
No, no, no.
Thank you.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.016
It's cool, I got it.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.356
Stella Kaine.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.058
Been a while.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.860
What the hell is this?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.662
Invitation to my private
after-party, come on.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.735
(scoffs)

09:27.768 --> 09:29.002
Thank you
for being such a gentleman.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.003
You know,
I twisted my ankle

09:30.037 --> 09:32.606
two weeks ago,
and it's still really hurting.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.374
Tragic.
So who'd you come here to hack?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.843
Hack?
Come on.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.345
We're not playing games,
we found your USB stick.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.814
Since when was it illegal
to have one of those?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.349
KRUMITZ: Just confirmed,
this is the exact

09:42.382 --> 09:44.084
USB stick that installed
the backdoor

09:44.117 --> 09:44.952
on Andrew Michaels' computer.

09:44.985 --> 09:48.221
You filed
the death certificate, Stella.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.356
Means bye-bye.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.390
(engine starts)

09:50.423 --> 09:52.025
Enjoy prison.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.128
Elijah, look at this.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.632
Stella Kaine is a
digital assassin for hire.

09:58.666 --> 10:02.035
She's got dossiers on every
person she's ever killed.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.336
It's more than 75 people

10:03.370 --> 10:04.772
last year alone.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.207
Issuing false
death certificates,

10:07.240 --> 10:09.810
creating havoc, forcing people
to prove they're alive,

10:09.843 --> 10:11.645
when a government document
says they're not.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.846
Yeah, D.B. was right,

10:12.880 --> 10:14.715
we've stumbled on
an entirely new exploit.

10:14.748 --> 10:17.150
Yeah, put it on
the long list of hacks

10:17.184 --> 10:18.952
we're gonna have to play defense
against in the future.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.721
Yeah, well,
the scariest part

10:20.754 --> 10:22.790
is that we are so far
behind this hack,

10:22.823 --> 10:24.892
we have no idea
how digital murder

10:24.925 --> 10:25.959
could play out
in the real world.

10:32.299 --> 10:38.238
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

10:40.340 --> 10:46.714
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

10:46.747 --> 10:50.050
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:50.083 --> 10:54.087
* I can see for miles
and miles *

10:54.121 --> 10:58.158
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:58.191 --> 11:01.995
* And miles...

11:02.029 --> 11:03.030
* Oh, yeah.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.276
Order.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.779
Approach the bench.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.248
Counselor, according
to these death certificates,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.817
both your witnesses are dead
and ineligible to testify.

11:23.851 --> 11:24.918
Your Honor,

11:24.952 --> 11:25.853
that is ridiculous.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.187
My two witnesses
are standing right there.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.321
You're looking at them.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.057
What I'm looking at is a D.A.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.458
who's delayed
this bail hearing twice.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.493
Now you come into
my courtroom without checking

11:33.526 --> 11:35.863
the legal status
of your witnesses?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.998
Do you have any other
evidence to present?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.199
Your Honor,
this is a blatant stall.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.133
Ms. Shaw,

11:40.167 --> 11:41.869
I can no longer hold

11:41.902 --> 11:43.170
Rafael Pintero in custody,

11:43.203 --> 11:45.305
based on the evidence
presented today.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.339
Bail is granted.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.108
(gavel bangs)

11:54.481 --> 11:57.951
Kyle Buckner. Molly Vance.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.320
Two key witnesses in my case
against Rafael Pintero.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.156
They were both murdered

12:03.190 --> 12:05.425
just hours after
Pintero's release on bail.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.027
Guy belongs
in a cage.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.361
I'd like to put him
in a cage myself,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.297
but Violent Crimes
would be the lead

12:10.330 --> 12:12.099
on this murder
of federal witnesses.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.300
I just came
from a meeting with them,

12:13.333 --> 12:16.036
they have agents
looking for Pintero now,

12:16.069 --> 12:18.371
and my third witness,
Martin Ward.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.340
When he heard about
the murders, he fled.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.342
I begged Martin to testify.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.045
If Pintero finds him
and kills him, it's on me.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.279
Why come to Cyber?

12:26.313 --> 12:27.948
Because this was a cyber crime.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.283
The only reason
Pintero received bail

12:30.317 --> 12:32.920
was because someone hacked
into the electronic

12:32.953 --> 12:34.154
death registration system
and digitally

12:34.187 --> 12:35.355
killed my witnesses.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.825
Oh, I guess we just
found out how digital murder

12:37.858 --> 12:39.292
can be used in the real world.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.494
Death certificates trump all
other forms of identification,

12:41.528 --> 12:42.930
so even though my witnesses

12:42.963 --> 12:44.397
were standing in court,

12:44.431 --> 12:46.166
legally they weren't.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.100
This black hat is responsible

12:47.134 --> 12:48.902
for putting Pintero
back on the street.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
And he could continue to

12:50.470 --> 12:51.571
digitally murder witnesses

12:51.604 --> 12:52.806
in trials all across

12:52.840 --> 12:54.507
the country.

12:54.541 --> 12:57.077
Is it possible we already
have the suspect in custody?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.246
We arrested Stella Kaine

12:59.279 --> 13:00.313
on a similar hack.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.381
But Stella Kaine did not

13:01.414 --> 13:02.916
digitally kill
the D.A.'s witnesses.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.217
How do we know that?

13:04.251 --> 13:05.986
Because she kept records
of all the people

13:06.019 --> 13:07.087
that she murdered,
and the witnesses

13:07.120 --> 13:08.088
aren't on the list.

13:08.121 --> 13:08.956
I just double-checked

13:08.989 --> 13:11.358
the electronic death
registration system.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.559
Both witnesses'
death certificates

13:12.592 --> 13:13.827
were submitted last night

13:13.861 --> 13:15.428
after we arrested
Stella Kaine.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.496
Which means

13:16.529 --> 13:18.999
our black hat
is still out there.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.868
We need to stop this hacker now,

13:20.901 --> 13:22.502
or Rafael Pintero

13:22.535 --> 13:25.372
will not be the last murderer
released from custody.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.040
I'd never file
a death certificate

13:27.074 --> 13:28.275
for a federal witness.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.576
You have my tablet;
look for yourself.

13:29.609 --> 13:30.643
We checked,

13:30.677 --> 13:33.480
we found nothing that
connects you to the hack.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.482
The question is,
are you part of a collective?

13:35.515 --> 13:38.451
Like I'd partner
with such a noob.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.854
You think the person who did
this is a beginner, why?

13:40.888 --> 13:43.356
On this document, under the
"method of disposition,"

13:43.390 --> 13:44.858
it's marked "burial."

13:44.892 --> 13:46.226
The problem with that is,

13:46.259 --> 13:47.427
the box next to it

13:47.460 --> 13:50.397
says "address of cemetery."

13:50.430 --> 13:51.464
So someone decides

13:51.498 --> 13:54.902
to dig up a grave,
but they don't find any body.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.404
It brings the whole document
into question.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.906
STELLA:
Cremation's the
only way to go.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.944
I just realized what this is.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.212
You

14:05.245 --> 14:09.449
need me to help you
find this hacker.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.384
Well, it's your lucky day,

14:11.418 --> 14:12.485
because I need immunity.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.954
Keep dreaming.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.422
We got you connected
to the digital murders

14:15.455 --> 14:16.990
of 75 people, including

14:17.024 --> 14:19.492
the ex-husband of
an FBI deputy director.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.194
You're looking at
unlawful intrusion,

14:21.228 --> 14:22.495
transmitting malicious code,

14:22.529 --> 14:23.563
conspiracy to defraud.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.531
That's two years, minimum.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.333
No immunity deal for me,

14:26.366 --> 14:28.101
and we'll all be walking away

14:28.135 --> 14:29.937
from this little powwow unhappy.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.504
Well, let's be very clear
about this, Stella,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.474
we will be unhappy at home.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.577
You will be unhappy
in an 8x10 jail cell.

14:37.610 --> 14:41.348
And what about this black hat
that you're chasing?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.650
He'll still be out there
in the big, bad world,

14:43.683 --> 14:48.521
digitally murdering people
and letting killers go free.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.656
All right, cut the crap.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.027
I will drop
the conspiracy charge

14:54.061 --> 14:56.329
if you plead to the other counts

14:56.363 --> 14:57.965
and help us find this black hat.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.602
Now let me counter your counter.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.139
You will drop everything.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.440
I will do no jail time

15:07.474 --> 15:08.475
and walk,

15:08.508 --> 15:09.943
or

15:09.977 --> 15:12.212
I won't say another word.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.518
It's hard to believe
that's the same woman.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.287
She looks so different.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.588
Stella socially
engineers her victims.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.456
She plays a different role

15:23.490 --> 15:24.324
for each mark.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.127
For you, she was
a damsel in distress.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.661
(tires squeal)

15:28.695 --> 15:30.163
That's how she hacked you.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.398
Yeah, but how?

15:31.431 --> 15:33.366
Where was your laptop?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.367
In the car.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.469
I put it in the backseat
when I gave her a lift.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.071
Let me clear that out first.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.142
Okay.
RYAN:
Was she ever alone with it?

15:42.175 --> 15:44.344
ANDREW:
Yeah, but only
for the length of time

15:44.377 --> 15:45.645
it took me to walk
around the car.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.348
RYAN:
All she needed was
to plug a drive

15:48.381 --> 15:49.649
into your laptop.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.318
It bypassed
your password protection.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.686
and auto-installed a backdoor.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.425
You know, there was
a man with her, too.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.294
He threw her to the ground
and then sped off.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.196
Probably hired him to play
a role in her con.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.998
Do you remember what
his face looked like?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.266
No, I was more concerned

16:06.299 --> 16:07.367
with Stella.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.070
She was pretty beat up, limping.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.604
I guess all that was fake, too.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.705
She was limping right now,

16:12.739 --> 16:15.008
so I think that
was actually real.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.010
Do you remember
anything else about him?

16:17.044 --> 16:18.745
Might have been wearing
a baseball cap.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.679
I can't be sure,

16:19.712 --> 16:22.715
and I was kind of blinded
by his headlights.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.085
So you're going
to give Stella a deal?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.654
We're looking at a hack
that we've never seen before.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.789
A hack that she's an expert in.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.758
And while what
she's been doing--

16:31.791 --> 16:33.726
killing civilians--

16:33.760 --> 16:36.329
it's bad, there's no question,

16:36.363 --> 16:38.531
the black hat that she's going
to help us catch

16:38.565 --> 16:40.267
has been targeting
federal witnesses

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
and letting felons go free.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.471
I get it,
it's the lesser of two evils.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.706
It doesn't make
my situation any better.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.108
I'm still dead.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.042
Unfortunately, that's true,

16:49.076 --> 16:54.447
but we do know who hired her
to kill you.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.649
Dennis Booker.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.785
We found a link

16:58.818 --> 17:01.721
for a wire transfer
from his account to Stella's.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.592
Oh, man, oh, man.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.659
What is it?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.263
Do you know him?

17:11.598 --> 17:13.800
I'm getting married.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.604
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything sooner.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.373
I picked up the phone
a dozen times to tell you,

17:20.407 --> 17:24.311
I just didn't know how.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.746
Are you marrying Dennis Booker?

17:26.779 --> 17:27.580
What?

17:27.614 --> 17:30.617
No, uh, my fiancé's name
is Jessica.

17:30.650 --> 17:31.784
Uh, formerly Jessica Booker.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.087
Dennis is her ex-husband.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.522
So the ex-husband

17:35.555 --> 17:38.091
is trying to disrupt
your, your wedding.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.192
He succeeded.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.461
I just found out my application

17:41.494 --> 17:43.696
for the marriage license
was rejected.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.065
Dead men can't marry.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.303
We'll sort this out, Andrew,

17:50.337 --> 17:53.173
just call your fiancé,

17:53.206 --> 17:57.844
reassure her that there's no
reason to cancel your wedding.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.114
Okay, let's do this, everybody.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.482
Krumitz, pull up the
death certificates

18:02.515 --> 18:04.584
of our two digitally
dead witnesses.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.652
Nelson,

18:05.685 --> 18:07.454
open the electronic death

18:07.487 --> 18:09.289
registration system home page,
please.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.290
Stella, you're up.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.158
Let's go.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.726
Time for you to earn
this deal of yours.

18:13.760 --> 18:18.265
Okay, well, consider this
Digital Death 101.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.566
It all starts when someone

18:19.599 --> 18:21.201
contacts your hacker

18:21.234 --> 18:22.869
and then hires them
to commit murder.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.346
Who would want to hire
a digital killer?

18:33.380 --> 18:35.415
Many, many people.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.350
Yeah, like a son who wants
his dad's life insurance

18:37.384 --> 18:39.886
before the old man
actually kicks the bucket.

18:39.919 --> 18:40.920
Or an angry employee

18:40.953 --> 18:43.656
who's trying to turn
their boss' life upside down.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.258
All great examples,
however,

18:45.292 --> 18:48.161
I don't care about the motive
or the victims.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.529
To me, it's just about

18:49.562 --> 18:52.232
that great big,
$10,000 paycheck.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.166
(laughs)

18:53.200 --> 18:55.168
Is something funny?

18:55.202 --> 18:56.936
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.806
I sleep just fine,
because I have my rules.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.808
No kids, no cops,

19:01.841 --> 19:03.610
everyone else is fair game.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.212
Ah, you're a real humanitarian,
that's nice.
All right, all right,

19:05.245 --> 19:07.514
all right, let's go, come on.
Go on.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.749
When your hacker gets paid,
he opens up

19:09.782 --> 19:12.785
a blank death certificate
for each victim.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.687
Yeah, but you need an awful lot
of personal information

19:14.721 --> 19:17.357
to ensure that that certificate
of death passes as legit.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.725
Information that would normally

19:18.758 --> 19:20.293
come from insurance companies

19:20.327 --> 19:22.295
and next of kin

19:22.329 --> 19:23.095
but our target is getting

19:23.129 --> 19:25.532
by hacking his victim's
devices.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.568
The most important part of that
form is "Cause of Death."

19:28.601 --> 19:29.902
Trick is to avoid

19:29.936 --> 19:31.271
any CODs that are going

19:31.304 --> 19:33.340
to trigger an investigation.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.841
Right, so no accidents
or drugs or violence.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.908
That's why

19:35.942 --> 19:37.944
all the people on your list
died of natural causes.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.045
Exactly.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.781
You tailor the natural cause
of death to the victim.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.284
Age, lifestyle,
that sort of thing.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.586
You want to avoid an autopsy
at all costs.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.255
A heart attack works great,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.223
however, cancer's my favorite.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.528
Hold on, though, the EDRS would
have to confirm the credentials

19:55.562 --> 19:57.764
of any doctor who signed
this form before circulating it

19:57.797 --> 19:58.831
throughout the system.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.300
You'd think so, but not so much.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.334
She's right,

20:01.368 --> 20:02.502
look at this.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.437
All you need to create
a doctor's account

20:04.471 --> 20:06.439
is get a medical license number

20:06.473 --> 20:08.675
and an address
for your practice.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.942
If your hacker's smart,

20:09.976 --> 20:11.611
he'll always be using
new doctors

20:11.644 --> 20:12.745
to keep you off his scent.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.314
That's what I would do.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.181
Let me ask you something,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.749
there's one thing
I still don't get.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.884
I know you need your victim's

20:17.917 --> 20:20.753
personal information to fill out
their death certificate,

20:20.787 --> 20:24.924
but there's so many different
ways to remotely hack somebody,

20:24.957 --> 20:27.794
so why,
why do you risk everything

20:27.827 --> 20:29.429
by doing it in person?

20:30.463 --> 20:32.265
It's more fun.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.433
Wow.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.601
Boy, when I was your age,

20:34.634 --> 20:36.469
I thought fun was
throwing a baseball.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.439
So if the target
is following these steps,

20:39.472 --> 20:40.940
he's probably
installing backdoors

20:40.973 --> 20:41.841
in the witnesses' devices.

20:41.874 --> 20:42.942
Which means if we
can find the hacker,

20:42.975 --> 20:46.346
we can use his backdoor
to locate the third witness

20:46.379 --> 20:47.880
and bring him in
before Pintero can kill him.

20:47.914 --> 20:48.848
Exactly.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.383
Stella Kaine,

20:50.417 --> 20:51.418
you're going to help us
save a life today.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.597
Agent Wilson will take you back
and stay with you.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.432
If you need anything at all,

21:05.465 --> 21:07.634
just call me,
no matter what time.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.870
You say that like I somehow
forgot you never sleep.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.640
Thanks, Avery.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.610
Hey.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.347
Where's he going?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.515
Going back to the hotel
to get some rest.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.983
This thing's been
really tough on him.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.388
He just told me
that he's getting remarried.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.557
Aw...

21:30.590 --> 21:32.525
You know, when I first
heard that he died,

21:32.559 --> 21:35.928
all that I wanted to do was
to tell him how I felt,

21:35.962 --> 21:37.764
and then the next thing I know,

21:37.797 --> 21:39.932
he's standing in front of me

21:39.966 --> 21:41.668
and telling me
about his wedding.

21:42.702 --> 21:45.705
Wow.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.108
Come on, that's it?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.710
Wow?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.680
This is when you're supposed
to tell me some story

21:53.713 --> 21:56.416
about a princess
in the 15th century

21:56.449 --> 21:58.718
who loses her duke to cholera,

21:58.751 --> 22:00.987
but how it all was okay.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.622
Something that makes me smile,

22:02.655 --> 22:05.692
something uplifting.

22:07.927 --> 22:11.130
Boy, I got nothing.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.700
Sometimes it just sucks.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.970
KRUMITZ:
We found him!

22:18.004 --> 22:19.071
We found him.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.407
He made a mistake
and we found him.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.408
Who?
Our target.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.410
He modified the routing table,
so we sand-boxed

22:23.443 --> 22:24.477
the victim's device
so we could watch...

22:24.511 --> 22:26.579
Daniel, do we have
a physical address?

22:26.613 --> 22:27.914
Yes.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.452
Move, move, move.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.786
Clear.
Clear!

22:34.621 --> 22:35.822
Clear.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.625
It's all clear.

22:38.658 --> 22:42.094
The landlord said the building
was pretty much abandoned.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.631
It looks like our target
was squatting.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.833
KRUMITZ:
Yeah, and ditched the
place after hacking

22:46.866 --> 22:47.700
the first two witnesses.

22:47.734 --> 22:48.968
Getting nothing
on the signal sniffer.

22:49.001 --> 22:49.936
So it's a dead end.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.104
RUSSELL:
Well, maybe not.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.906
Look at these dead leaves.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.074
What do you see?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.477
Uh, dead leaves?

22:57.510 --> 22:58.678
(chuckles)
That's funny.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.948
No, it... I mean, the-the roots
are outside the building,

23:01.981 --> 23:03.716
right, so the
plants obviously

23:03.750 --> 23:05.585
should be getting
enough water to survive,

23:05.618 --> 23:07.687
but when you look at this little
circular area right here

23:07.720 --> 23:09.456
and the leaves are all dead...

23:09.489 --> 23:12.992
It's just like this
botany experiment

23:13.025 --> 23:14.861
I've been working
on the past few weeks.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.095
Trees all over the world

23:16.128 --> 23:17.764
in certain urban areas

23:17.797 --> 23:18.665
are mysteriously dying.

23:18.698 --> 23:22.001
Nobody knows why,
but I-I think I do.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.537
See, I think there's
a connection between

23:24.571 --> 23:27.474
Wi-Fi signals
and plants decaying,

23:27.507 --> 23:28.508
and, uh, it's
a long shot, but...

23:28.541 --> 23:29.576
Elijah,

23:29.609 --> 23:31.478
have SWAT bring the
battering ram back up here.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.745
They're going to need it.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.922
Well, that sure looks like

23:42.955 --> 23:44.924
a router to me.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.126
Okay, I did
a reverse DNS lookup

23:47.159 --> 23:50.597
and got an Internet traffic
history off the router logs.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.766
MUNDO:
Yahoo, ESPN...

23:53.800 --> 23:54.934
FriendAgenda--
it looks pretty ordinary.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.235
Yeah, except for this.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.572
East Cambridge University
Web site.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.675
I arrested Stella for hacking
their admissions department.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.577
Now, what's the likelihood
that two black hats,

24:04.611 --> 24:06.012
offering the same
Deep Web service,

24:06.045 --> 24:07.680
both have an affiliation

24:07.714 --> 24:09.048
to East Cambridge University?

24:10.817 --> 24:12.719
Stella Kaine knows
more than she admitted.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.753
It's time she
tells us the truth.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.594
KRUMITZ:
Okay, no more games, Stella.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.530
I know you're connected
to the Pintero witness hack,

24:23.563 --> 24:24.230
I just want to know how.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.633
I have nothing to do with that.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.000
You've been through
all of my devices,

24:28.034 --> 24:29.135
you know all my kills.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.537
Well, if that's true,

24:30.570 --> 24:32.038
why don't you help me understand

24:32.071 --> 24:32.839
why this router,

24:32.872 --> 24:34.541
which was linked
to the witness hack,

24:34.574 --> 24:35.875
also has a connection

24:35.908 --> 24:37.810
to your old admissions hack.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.278
And I swear,

24:39.311 --> 24:41.280
if you're withholding from me,

24:41.313 --> 24:43.550
I can rip up that immunity deal

24:43.583 --> 24:44.216
right now.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.255
Look, okay,

24:49.288 --> 24:51.958
I promise you, I have not been
withholding anything.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.260
I just had to be sure.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.762
Because if you
have found evidence

24:55.795 --> 24:57.063
of the admissions hack

24:57.096 --> 24:58.030
on this router,

24:58.064 --> 25:01.768
I do believe I know
who we're looking for.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.169
Well, then keep talking.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.304
You're real cute
when you get angry.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.206
I feel like there's
a connection between us.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.541
Just think
about it like this--

25:08.575 --> 25:09.542
if I wasn't a black hat

25:09.576 --> 25:11.978
and you weren't a white hat,
we could totally...

25:12.011 --> 25:13.112
All right, all right, all right.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.213
Enough.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.214
Keep talking.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.250
Okay, you're so boring, fine.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.553
After college,

25:20.587 --> 25:23.556
I took a job at an accounting
firm back in, in Madison.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.191
It was so boring.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.693
What was the name of the firm?

25:27.594 --> 25:29.295
Grant and Wallace.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.597
The job was boring,

25:30.630 --> 25:31.297
so I spent most
of my work hours

25:31.330 --> 25:34.266
on these IRC hacker channels.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.837
And there was this one that
was amazing, Lion's Archive.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.871
That's where I met him.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.107
At first, we just started
talking about ideas

25:41.140 --> 25:42.308
and sharing hacks,

25:42.341 --> 25:43.375
and eventually
we became partners,

25:43.409 --> 25:46.979
and that's how the whole
Cambridge thing happened.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.615
I don't know,
when I arrested you for that,

25:48.648 --> 25:49.716
you never once mentioned
a partner.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.851
No, no, I didn't,

25:51.884 --> 25:53.853
because I believe there is
honor amongst thieves.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.655
(laughs)

25:55.688 --> 25:57.189
Okay.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.759
Come on, more.

25:59.792 --> 26:00.793
More about the partner.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.895
One of the ideas we were
throwing around was how to

26:02.929 --> 26:04.764
digitally kill someone.

26:04.797 --> 26:07.366
We were going to try it out on
my miserable boss, Mr. Wallace,

26:07.399 --> 26:08.735
but before I got the chance,

26:08.768 --> 26:10.603
you kicked down my door.

26:10.637 --> 26:13.072
And when you got out of jail,
you hung up the shingle, right?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.106
Of course.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.742
Have you had any contact

26:15.775 --> 26:16.909
with your partner since then?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.144
I went looking for him once,

26:18.177 --> 26:19.846
but the forum
had been shut down.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.981
To be honest with you,
I wasn't even mad about it

26:22.014 --> 26:23.115
because towards the end,

26:23.149 --> 26:24.216
he was talking crazy.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.317
He was saying stuff

26:25.351 --> 26:28.320
like there's way more money
to be made killing cops

26:28.354 --> 26:29.622
and freeing criminals,

26:29.656 --> 26:30.690
and I may be
a bad person at times,

26:30.723 --> 26:32.759
but I do not do that.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.694
What was his name, Stella?

26:34.727 --> 26:37.296
I only know his handle.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.132
Four months ago, someone going
by the handle Reaper32

26:40.166 --> 26:42.001
posted this message
in a black hat forum:

26:42.034 --> 26:44.737
RYAN:
"Need a law enforcement
officer killed?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.072
Look no further."

26:46.105 --> 26:48.775
This guy's advertising
killing cops.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.376
All right, the forum's Webmaster
let us behind the site code,

26:50.409 --> 26:51.811
and look at this.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.915
Reaper sent them back a link.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.817
Our target's
Deep Web site.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.688
He's marketing himself as
a cyber hit man for criminals.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.089
RAMIREZ:
For a large fee,

27:03.122 --> 27:05.424
he'll digitally kill
a cop chasing you,

27:05.457 --> 27:06.759
a lawyer trying you,

27:06.793 --> 27:09.395
or a witness
testifying against you.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.363
Right, because a dead cop
can't pull a warrant

27:11.397 --> 27:13.099
or make an arrest.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.433
A dead lawyer can't go to trial.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.467
Do we know
anything about

27:15.501 --> 27:17.670
where this site is hosted
or who's hosting it?

27:17.704 --> 27:18.705
NELSON:
Negative.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.772
The server IP address is bogus

27:19.806 --> 27:21.140
and Reaper doesn't reveal
anything about himself.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.709
I mean, the guy's careful.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.110
So we're not actually
any closer to catching him.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.245
Well, let's try to use
the site as it was intended,

27:26.278 --> 27:27.513
to hire him.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.381
Nelson, will you click on the
"How it works"?
NELSON: Yeah.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.684
RUSSELL:
Okay, so it looks like Reaper

27:31.718 --> 27:32.952
makes you upload
a video of yourself.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.053
You give your name,

27:34.086 --> 27:35.788
the name of your
intended victim,

27:35.822 --> 27:38.791
and an explanation
for why you need them dead.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.192
If he takes you on,

27:40.226 --> 27:42.094
he responds to your
video message and arranges

27:42.128 --> 27:44.196
an in-person pick up of his fee.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.898
Okay, now why would someone
willingly send a video

27:45.932 --> 27:47.466
that incriminates themselves?

27:47.499 --> 27:48.367
Well, Reaper's clients
are desperate.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.870
They'll do anything
to escape justice.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.038
All right,
so we send Reaper a video

27:52.071 --> 27:53.806
requesting he
digitally kill some cop,

27:53.840 --> 27:56.308
hope he bites, and when he shows
up to get paid, we grab him.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.209
That's the idea.
Great.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.878
I volunteer.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.346
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It can't be you.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.114
This video is his way
of weeding out

28:02.148 --> 28:03.349
undercover agents.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.484
We don't have to time to build
you up a bulletproof cover.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.953
Yeah, and we can't risk
you dangling out there

28:06.986 --> 28:08.120
with a story full of holes.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.421
I'll take my chances.
No, no, I agree

28:09.455 --> 28:10.489
with these two.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.058
We have to assume that Reaper
does his homework.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.125
We can't use an agent.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.160
We need a civilian.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.227
A civilian,

28:15.261 --> 28:17.764
who believably wants
to kill a cop.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.232
Well, maybe not.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.169
Maybe we just need somebody

28:23.202 --> 28:26.338
with an incredibly
compelling true story

28:26.372 --> 28:29.041
and an offer
that Reaper can't resist.

28:29.075 --> 28:32.478
My name is Andrew Michaels.

28:32.511 --> 28:35.414
Three days ago, I woke up dead.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.050
I don't know if you killed me,

28:38.084 --> 28:40.186
or at this point,
I don't even care.

28:40.219 --> 28:44.891
I need my life back.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.059
No one can fix this.

28:47.093 --> 28:49.896
I'm-I'm out of my options, uh,

28:49.929 --> 28:52.364
I'm getting married
in a month.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.533
Was getting married.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.871
Dead people can't get
a marriage license.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.473
The look on my fiancé's face
when I told her.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.909
I just...

29:05.812 --> 29:08.414
I love her so much.

29:08.447 --> 29:13.185
J-Jessica...
she's everything to me.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.287
Everything.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.156
I just want
to marry her,

29:17.189 --> 29:21.060
so, please, I'll
pay you $33,000.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.795
That's what I
have to offer.

29:22.829 --> 29:25.865
Please.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.876
Uh, what, what now?

29:37.910 --> 29:41.447
We wait.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.157
I'm glad you found someone.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.027
Sounds like you really love her.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.595
I'm-I'm sorry.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.596
It's-it's just the way
it came out.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.832
It was on my mind, and you...

30:02.534 --> 30:05.838
You deserve to be happy.

30:05.872 --> 30:10.542
I always thought
I was going to be alone.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.312
Then I met Jessica.

30:16.082 --> 30:19.919
Andrew, I have to ask you about
(clears throat)

30:19.952 --> 30:21.620
the life insurance.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.858
Oh, why you're still
my beneficiary.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.559
It's been over ten years.

30:27.593 --> 30:31.063
Uh, uh, you're going
to think I'm crazy.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.831
It wouldn't be the first time.
(both laugh)

30:33.933 --> 30:36.068
Uh...

30:38.437 --> 30:40.406
Uh, okay, um,

30:40.439 --> 30:46.112
about six months
after Hannah and us,

30:46.145 --> 30:49.548
I had a mild heart attack.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.450
Mild.

30:51.483 --> 30:54.987
Doctor said it was
just too much stress

30:55.021 --> 30:56.889
and Scotch.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.657
In recovery,

30:58.690 --> 30:59.825
I'm filling out
the paperwork.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.963
I find myself staring at the
"in case of emergency" box.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.599
It hits me...

31:09.568 --> 31:12.171
I'm alone.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.642
Whose name do I put down?

31:16.675 --> 31:20.512
It's supposed to be the person
who comes to your rescue.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.349
Makes you feel safe,
who you l...

31:27.619 --> 31:29.989
There was no one
else, Avery.

31:30.022 --> 31:34.026
Your name went
on a lot of forms.

31:35.561 --> 31:39.498
I put your name on
a lot of my boxes, too.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.100
But you know what?

31:41.133 --> 31:43.702
That's going to have to change
when you get married.

31:43.735 --> 31:47.940
I suppose so.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.013
I...
(computer pings)

31:59.618 --> 32:00.486
So it worked?

32:00.519 --> 32:01.720
It looks like we're
heading to Philly

32:01.753 --> 32:02.955
to catch a Reaper.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.580
MUNDO:
All right, everyone, listen up.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.316
Our target could be anyone.

32:30.349 --> 32:31.750
We have no photo, no real name,

32:31.783 --> 32:33.719
so keep your eyes open.

32:33.752 --> 32:35.054
Here's your stuff,

32:35.087 --> 32:36.322
minus your devices.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.990
Those will remain
with the FBI

32:38.024 --> 32:40.459
as evidence,
in case you decide to stray.

32:40.492 --> 32:43.095
Don't worry, I will not be
crossing the line again.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.096
Well, we'll
find that out,

32:44.130 --> 32:44.997
won't we?

32:45.031 --> 32:46.598
Stella, don't take
this the wrong way,

32:46.632 --> 32:48.334
but I never want
to see you again.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.036
Okay.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.178
MUNDO: We got a male
approaching, early 20s,

32:59.211 --> 33:00.679
baseball cap.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.449
SWAT OFFICER:
Blond hair, green jacket.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.616
Got my sights on him now.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.352
He appears to be alone.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.064
MUNDO:
False alarm.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.032
Just a pedestrian.

33:20.066 --> 33:21.333
This gentleman will see you out.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.435
Thank you.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.105
I'd really like
to tell your ex-husband

33:26.138 --> 33:29.208
that I'm sorry for everything.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.110
I'll send the message along.

33:34.413 --> 33:39.118
A male, dark-haired, beard,
leather jacket and blue jeans,

33:39.151 --> 33:40.352
nine o'clock.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.453
See him, doesn't look
like he brought backup.

33:41.487 --> 33:44.390
MUNDO:
All right,

33:44.423 --> 33:46.158
we wait for confirmation.
This is our target.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.359
All teams hold, I repeat, hold.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.261
We go on my signal.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.308
Andrew Michaels?

34:03.775 --> 34:04.776
You Reaper?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.212
Open the bag.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.188
STELLA:
After college, I took a job

34:16.222 --> 34:19.091
at an accounting firm
back in-in Madison.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.292
What was the name of the firm?

34:21.227 --> 34:22.728
Grant and Wallace.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.102
ANDREW:
It's all here.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.470
All $33,000.
Everything I own.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.538
Just shut up and give it to me.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.274
I need to know you're going
to follow through.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.642
I need my life back.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.577
I guess you're not
a religious man.

34:39.678 --> 34:40.846
Resurrection takes faith.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.215
That's it.
Go, go, go!

34:43.249 --> 34:44.583
In 48 hours
you'll have your life back.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.588
STELLA:
I took a job at
an accounting firm

34:49.621 --> 34:52.224
back in Madison.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.327
Go, go!

34:55.361 --> 34:56.362
(tires screech, car horn honks)

34:59.298 --> 35:01.733
(indistinct chatter)

35:04.236 --> 35:05.571
Drop the weapon!

35:05.604 --> 35:06.838
OFFICER:
We got him covered.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.341
STELLA: So I spent most
of my work hours on these IRC

35:09.375 --> 35:10.842
hacker channels,

35:10.876 --> 35:13.879
and there was an amazing one
called Lion's Archive.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.281
That's where I met him.

35:16.282 --> 35:18.317
Lion's Archive.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.822
Stand back!
Hold it.

35:23.855 --> 35:24.856
MUNDO:
If you have the shot, take it.

35:24.890 --> 35:26.158
OFFICER:
Drop your weapon!

35:28.360 --> 35:31.363
Stand back or I'll shoot!
Put the gun down!

35:34.333 --> 35:35.334
(grunts)

35:35.967 --> 35:37.203
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.344
MUNDO:
Andrew, tell me
that right hook

35:45.377 --> 35:46.645
has seen the inside
of a boxing ring.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.782
Nice to meet you, Reaper.
Reaper?

35:50.816 --> 35:51.950
You're under arrest.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.685
I'm not Reaper,
I just get the money.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.721
(phone buzzing)

35:57.756 --> 35:58.924
What do you got, Krumitz?

35:58.957 --> 36:01.193
Did anyone show up
to your sting?
Yeah, we got Reaper.

36:01.227 --> 36:02.728
Of course, he claims
we got the wrong guy.

36:02.761 --> 36:03.729
Let me see his face.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.401
Stella Kaine.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.303
It's been a while.

36:17.376 --> 36:18.944
He was in the club.
MUNDO: Who?

36:18.977 --> 36:20.279
That guy you just arrested.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.380
He was helping Stella.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.250
I got it.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.320
The DJ.
Her mark was the DJ.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.758
Keyser Soze!
Move.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.226
Keyser Soze!

36:34.260 --> 36:35.427
(quietly):
Keyser Soze.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.530
Hey, Daniel,
why are you yelling?

36:38.564 --> 36:39.331
Keyser Soze!

36:39.365 --> 36:41.367
Daniel, what are
you talking about?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.368
She Keyser Soze'd us.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.935
S-Stella. She's our black hat.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.003
She's Reaper.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.305
Elijah is in the field

36:46.338 --> 36:47.773
arresting Reaper as we speak.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.875
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
Hey, hey,

36:49.908 --> 36:51.310
slow down, breathe, breathe.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.379
Reaper was just here.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.813
Stella is Reaper.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.682
She's got two sites.

36:56.715 --> 36:57.816
Two businesses.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.418
The first is
for killing civilians

36:59.451 --> 37:00.986
and the second is
for killing law enforcement.

37:01.019 --> 37:02.854
She's the digital killer
that we're chasing.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.856
That's why the third witness
was never killed.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.792
Because we stopped her before
she could finish the job.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.627
Well, then who just walked
into Elijah's sting?

37:08.660 --> 37:09.795
Who'd he just arrest?

37:09.828 --> 37:10.729
Stella's lackey.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.130
I called 911.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.665
KRUMITZ:
Stella had a guy with her
the night she hacked Andrew.

37:13.699 --> 37:14.933
I'll bet you,

37:14.966 --> 37:18.370
the same guy was at the club,
along with the intended victim,

37:18.404 --> 37:20.439
which is the third witness.

37:20.472 --> 37:21.373
But Stella
was already in custody

37:21.407 --> 37:22.441
when the death certificates
were filed.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.575
You said so yourself.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.576
Yeah, but...

37:24.610 --> 37:25.811
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.546
We found time-release software
on her tablet.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.880
I mean,
not that suspicious by itself--

37:28.914 --> 37:30.349
lots of hackers have it--

37:30.382 --> 37:31.817
but it could
have allowed Stella

37:31.850 --> 37:34.353
to automatically send in
death certificates at any time.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.322
Yes, Stella could
have set a timer

37:36.355 --> 37:38.290
to submit the certificates
the night

37:38.324 --> 37:41.360
before the witnesses testified,
or her lackey sent them in.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.994
This is
Deputy Director Avery Ryan,

37:43.028 --> 37:44.963
Stop Stella Kaine, do not let
her leave the building.

37:44.996 --> 37:47.333
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, Deputy Director,
she's gone.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.301
She's gone.
I want agents sweeping

37:49.335 --> 37:50.536
every inch of D.C.

37:50.569 --> 37:51.970
I've got to call DOJ.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.038
Look, man, I'm sorry.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.172
You were right.

37:54.205 --> 37:56.408
We should have chipped Stella
when we had the chance.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.576
Guys, I have something
to show you.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.647
Come on.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.014
Look.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.816
She just swiped her credit card.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.418
KRUMITZ:
She's so desperate
to get out of town,

38:06.452 --> 38:07.719
she's making mistakes.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.555
NELSON:
The cocky ones always do.

38:09.588 --> 38:10.789
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

38:10.822 --> 38:12.458
All right, thank you so much.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.831
Stella Kaine.
Hands in the air.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.333
RYAN:
Go.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.368
Stay back.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.836
Wow, I'm impressed.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.373
Guess what-- I figured it out.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.374
You lied.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.108
You're Reaper,

38:30.141 --> 38:32.043
which voids your
immunity deal.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.880
Stella Kaine,
you're under arrest.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.749
STELLA:
Okay, I'll probably
get two years

38:37.783 --> 38:39.351
and be out in one
for good behavior.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.452
RYAN:
Not this time, Stella.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.488
You're looking
at 25 years to life.

38:42.521 --> 38:43.889
What?
That's ridiculous.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.391
Your hack resulted in

38:45.424 --> 38:47.092
two real-world homicides.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.928
You're looking at two counts
of felony murder.

38:54.566 --> 38:55.767
(phone beeps)

38:55.801 --> 38:57.436
Mm, check that out.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.338
Hey, you're forgetting to limp.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.041
I got a text from Elijah.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.476
Stella's lackey

39:04.510 --> 39:05.577
gave up Pintero's lawyer.

39:05.611 --> 39:09.114
Elijah found Pintero hiding
at the lawyer's house.

39:09.147 --> 39:12.117
Looks like Stella's not the
only one going to jail today.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.553
Some days this is
just so satisfying.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.556
I love this job.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.959
RYAN:
Well, I made some calls.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.962
The state of Connecticut
has officially

39:23.995 --> 39:26.598
started the process
of bringing you back to life.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.735
That's wonderful news.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.003
It might take a while.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.540
There's really no precedent
for reversing

39:34.573 --> 39:37.042
a legally filed
death certificate.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.844
I'm sure it's
incredibly complicated.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.079
As far as
Dennis Booker goes,

39:41.112 --> 39:45.517
someone might have called the,
uh, local PD and...

39:48.119 --> 39:52.758
Your fiancé's ex-husband
won't be bothering you anymore.

39:58.697 --> 39:59.898
I don't

39:59.931 --> 40:02.067
know what to say...

40:04.703 --> 40:07.739
...other than...

40:09.975 --> 40:12.077
...thank you.

40:20.151 --> 40:23.088
Uh...

40:26.592 --> 40:31.162
Uh, I love you still.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.965
For whatever that's worth.

40:38.570 --> 40:39.571
I love you still.
