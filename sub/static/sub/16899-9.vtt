00:04.650 --> 00:05.730
Our new security man.

00:05.780 --> 00:07.338
Clifford Parry.

00:07.390 --> 00:08.732
Meet Gladys Witham.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.748
Hey stop! Vera you
gotta believe me.

00:11.790 --> 00:15.487
Our boys have landed in France.
Small coastal village, Dieppe.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.316
Things did not go well.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.316
So many young men's
lives changed.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.009
You could ease a loneliness.

00:21.060 --> 00:25.360
There is a balm in Gilead

00:25.410 --> 00:30.154
Men and women working
together, it's a powder keg.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.019
I'm sorry.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.970
Don't do it again.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.249
The war may be won or lost
on the strength of the
intelligence we gather.

00:36.290 --> 00:38.155
What do you need me to do?

00:38.210 --> 00:41.509
Go back to your regular
life. Make sure no one
suspect anything.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.426
Wow, this article sure tears a
strip off the brass who planned
the whole Dieppe raid.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.438
Here comes George and Gracie.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.438
Hey, Kate. Look at this.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.948
They're doing an "All-Girl
Revue" at the Jewel.

00:57.010 --> 00:58.614
What's an All-Girl Revue?

00:58.660 --> 01:01.220
It's a revue.
With all girls.

01:01.270 --> 01:03.443
These days they have
all-girl everything.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.094
So?

01:05.150 --> 01:08.495
So? Kate's a singer.
It's a chance to sing.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.929
Kate has been singing. At
the hospital, for soldiers.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.709
Ivan, this could be a real gig.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.718
You have a real gig, baby,
right here at the factory.

01:15.770 --> 01:17.544
Honey, he's very cute,

01:17.590 --> 01:20.115
but I wouldn't let him
tell you what to do.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.242
Oh Yeah? And who are you,
Ma'am?

01:22.290 --> 01:24.941
Dottie Shannon. Which
the way to the office?

01:24.990 --> 01:26.423
Dottie Shannon.
The reporter?

01:26.470 --> 01:28.028
Yes.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.469
We were just reading your
article in the Telegram.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.475
You wrote this?

01:31.520 --> 01:32.908
I did.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.734
Why'd you call the whole
Dieppe raid one big blunder?

01:34.790 --> 01:38.396
Because someone has to call it
like the rest of us see it.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.739
Listen, sweetie. I'm a Canuck
only by marriage, alright?

01:41.790 --> 01:46.443
Where I'm from, criticizing
the Brits is an art-form.

01:46.490 --> 01:48.754
There'll be lots to write
about in the factory.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.191
I can't wait to get a look at
the whole thing. How you do it
is beyond me.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.662
You must be Mrs. Shannon.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.109
That's exactly how my
second husband proposed.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.458
Mr. Aikins asked me
to keep an eye out.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.899
I'm told you have permission
to visit all week.

02:01.940 --> 02:04.465
Yes, I'm writing a series,
"Woman at War."

02:04.510 --> 02:06.205
Don't worry,
I'll blend right in.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.468
You'll need to leave
the hat with me.

02:08.510 --> 02:11.513
But I wore this topper when I
interviewed the Prime Minister!

02:11.560 --> 02:12.333
And the earrings.

02:12.390 --> 02:14.164
Well alright then.

02:14.220 --> 02:18.042
The handbag stays,
it's metal clasp.

02:18.090 --> 02:22.868
Well let me just get out the
tools of my trade then.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.399
The fountain pen.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.045
How will I take notes?

02:27.100 --> 02:28.135
With a pencil.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.887
This is a bomb factory,
Mrs. Shannon.

02:31.930 --> 02:35.491
And I'm sure you'll
give me an explosive story.

02:42.590 --> 02:45.411
Is it true they call you
girls who work the cordite

02:45.460 --> 02:46.597
"Powder Puffs"?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.073
Yeah or "Canaries."

02:48.120 --> 02:50.680
That's on account of how
If you're not careful,

02:50.730 --> 02:52.379
the chemicals can stain our skin

02:52.430 --> 02:54.079
"... a lovely shade
of yellow..."

02:54.130 --> 02:56.200
Mrs. Shannon, I've asked
you to stand back.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.900
I'm back, I'm back.

02:59.960 --> 03:01.689
Your_matron takes
her Job seriously.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.435
It's a dangerous
place to work.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.948
So if the cordite turns
your skin yellow,

03:06.010 --> 03:08.478
what do you think it
does to your insides?

03:08.530 --> 03:11.181
They say as long as we take
precautions, it's safe.

03:11.230 --> 03:14.484
And those routine X-rays,
are those precautions?

03:14.540 --> 03:18.055
I'm sure your readers would
rather hear the positive

03:18.110 --> 03:20.146
aspects of our work.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.361
Well it's my job to
report the truth.

03:22.410 --> 03:26.506
Seems to me you ought to do
it in a way that inspires the
war effort.

03:26.550 --> 03:28.586
Seems to me, that's
your opinion.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.369
I've asked you to stand back.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.595
It's for your own protection.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.518
That's protection?
You nearly blew us all up!

03:37.560 --> 03:40.120
No-one's blowing up.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.558
The cordite,

03:41.610 --> 03:44.477
will need to be re-weighed,
wrapped, and inspected.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.476
Harold - Lorna!

03:49.530 --> 03:52.613
We won't make quota today.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.460
I wondered when
I'd see you again.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.169
Why are we whispering?

04:22.210 --> 04:23.734
You said you'd be in touch.

04:23.780 --> 04:24.997
And I will.

04:25.040 --> 04:25.734
VVhen?

04:25.780 --> 04:27.031
When the need arises.

04:27.090 --> 04:28.648
There are changes a foot.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.567
You'll let me know when
there's a problem?

04:33.620 --> 04:35.485
Wait.

04:35.530 --> 04:38.579
What does that mean?

04:38.620 --> 04:42.351
Miss Witham, you have cream
cauliflower on your cheek.

04:54.550 --> 04:56.279
Still saving up for a home?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.673
Absolutely.

04:58.730 --> 05:03.850
It'd be nice to have a
real place, to raise a
family in a proper home.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.421
You and Ivan started
talking kids?

05:07.480 --> 05:09.345
No.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.119
But I know he likes them.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.693
He's a good egg, that one.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.605
You buying a house?

05:14.660 --> 05:15.786
Why not.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.616
It's no Rosedale palace,

05:17.660 --> 05:21.312
but it'll suit my
needs just fine.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.049
Anyway, a girl needs
goals in life.

05:27.930 --> 05:31.058
That woman is a news-hawk
In a dress.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.362
I'm having her turfed.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.365
The thing is,

05:35.420 --> 05:37.547
Sir, that spill was my fault.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.808
That's not what it looked
like from up here.

05:39.860 --> 05:42.374
She's come here to
sniff out a story.

05:42.420 --> 05:44.149
Let's not give her
the wrong one.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.814
You wanted to see me, Capo?

05:45.860 --> 05:47.908
Give us the room, Lorna.

05:51.780 --> 05:55.477
There's gonna be a new
security protocol for
materials handling.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.521
Oh yeah?

05:56.570 --> 05:59.038
Your job doesn't much
change except,

05:59.090 --> 06:02.526
Leon is going to sign
off on everything now.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.832
You're putting me
under Leon?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.667
Not under. You're,
you know... equals.

06:06.710 --> 06:11.272
So now the guy that I trained is
now gonna be looking over my
shoulder all day?

06:11.320 --> 06:15.973
I'm following orders. I work
for the man, same as you.

06:16.020 --> 06:20.502
Look if you can't stand up
to them, at least be
real with me.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.630
What's really going on?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.501
Following the rules.

06:27.250 --> 06:32.517
Mrs. Corbett. I was wondering
if I might chat with you for
my story.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.518
I'm sure you can ﬁnd more
interesting people to talk to.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.471
I know subjects and
you're a good one.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.739
I won't participate in an
article that_ criticizes
my girls.

06:40.790 --> 06:44.260
They work far too hard to
have the press take potshots.

06:44.310 --> 06:48.440
Your girls, Mrs. Corbett,
will inspire my readers
and so will you.

06:48.490 --> 06:50.538
I merely do what's
asked of me here.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.616
Undersold by a country mile.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.444
I'm going to miss my streetcar.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.627
Let me give you a ride home.

06:56.670 --> 06:59.673
Please, you've been on your
feet all day, Mrs. Corbett.

06:59.720 --> 07:02.416
It's right over here, come.
Yes?

07:03.810 --> 07:06.677
I've given two years of
my life to that place.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.460
For what?
To be treated like dirt.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.115
The honchos want more
eyes on our papenNork.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.376
Chalk it up to that.

07:13.430 --> 07:16.513
I would chalk it up to that,
if it were true.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.949
I think I got to quit my job.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.479
Don't say that.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.044
They leave me no choice.

07:22.090 --> 07:25.787
Jones - Alright next girl.

07:28.400 --> 07:33.838
In Dublin's fair city,
where the girls are so pretty

07:33.880 --> 07:38.533
I first set my eyes on sweet
Molly Malone

07:38.580 --> 07:41.014
As she wheeled
her wheelbarrow

07:41.060 --> 07:43.233
Through streets
broad and narrow

07:43.280 --> 07:47.671
Crying cockles and mussels
alive a-live O!

07:47.720 --> 07:48.414
A-live

07:48.460 --> 07:49.859
Hey cupcake,

07:49.900 --> 07:51.504
quit singing and tell
me something.

07:51.550 --> 07:54.371
Why do you even want this gig?

07:54.430 --> 07:56.079
I'm a singer...

07:56.120 --> 07:59.647
with a chance to prove myself,
I might have a real career.

07:59.690 --> 08:01.646
Every second girl I
know wants to sing.

08:01.690 --> 08:06.172
If the boys want Little
Orphan Annie, they can find
her in the funny pages.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.529
I can borrow something.
A better dress?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.390
Come down here.

08:14.710 --> 08:19.534
Sorry, hon. You look like
"little sweet miss ain't
never been kissed."

08:23.320 --> 08:25.493
Good on ya. Don't let
that windbag...

08:32.070 --> 08:36.154
I've been kissed, Mr. Jones.
You've seen it yourself.

08:36.210 --> 08:40.169
Pack some of that punch into
your act? I'll give you a song.

08:40.210 --> 08:43.168
Thank you.

08:43.210 --> 08:45.212
You won't regret it.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.214
Worst case, we got a
comedy number.

08:49.260 --> 08:51.080
Next!

09:06.890 --> 09:08.107
Oh boy.

09:20.820 --> 09:21.946
I'll take it.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.685
Geeze... You buy on every turn!

09:23.730 --> 09:27.166
My old man always said, if
you do one thing in life,

09:27.210 --> 09:29.770
buyland.

09:29.830 --> 09:35.120
Yeah, but now you're
nearly broke.

09:35.180 --> 09:37.307
Investing in the future...

09:37.350 --> 09:39.693
seems a good idea.

09:39.750 --> 09:43.311
How long am I stuck
in the slammer?

09:43.360 --> 09:45.134
Gotta earn your way out.

09:45.190 --> 09:49.149
Roll a double, pay
the fine or...

09:49.190 --> 09:53.627
kiss me like you
did at the club.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.024
Woops. Sorry!

10:04.080 --> 10:06.548
No Vera, what is it?

10:06.600 --> 10:07.988
Maybe I'll come back later...

10:08.040 --> 10:10.258
No!Yes!

10:10.300 --> 10:14.339
Okay. There's something
you need to hear.

10:14.390 --> 10:17.177
It's about the Revue.

10:19.440 --> 10:23.171
My oven's broken or
I'd heat them up.

10:23.230 --> 10:26.449
If my husband were
in town he'd fix it

10:26.490 --> 10:27.741
Delicious.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.574
It's french mayonnaise.
It's not hard to make.

10:29.620 --> 10:31.929
Do you know I think I
wrote about that once,

10:31.970 --> 10:33.665
when they had me doing recipes.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.405
I know. That's where
I learned it.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.677
You did?
Thank you.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.938
I learned it from a man in the
Gare du Nord.

10:39.980 --> 10:42.892
He invited me over to dinner
with his family.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.589
I thought "family"
was a euphemism,

10:44.640 --> 10:48.371
until I showed up and there was
his wife and five children.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.682
But the food was wonderful.

10:50.730 --> 10:53.290
I'd love to see Paris.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.205
So you collected my recipes?

10:55.260 --> 10:57.387
I did.

10:57.430 --> 11:01.389
I mean before the war, all
they let us gals write about
was homemaking or gossip.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.908
Only now, with the men
overseas...

11:03.960 --> 11:07.703
You know, Hitler gave me
a career in journalism.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.220
My husband says you're only
out to kick the hornet's nest.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.228
This that so?
What's your opinion?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.360
Truthfully?

11:15.410 --> 11:16.570
Yes.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.848
I used to think you
were uppity,

11:18.890 --> 11:21.358
barging into a man's world.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.026
Until I started working
there myself.

11:24.070 --> 11:26.584
Well I can live with uppity.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.508
But someone has to ask the
hard questions about Dieppe.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.723
My son fought there,
Mrs. Shannon.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.328
I know.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.905
And I was relieved to
hear that Stanley survived.

11:36.950 --> 11:40.169
I do my homework.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.609
And tug out people's secrets.

11:42.650 --> 11:46.563
Well the mayonnaise?
Safe with me.

11:46.610 --> 11:48.214
Burlesque?

11:48.270 --> 11:50.522
Yes sirree Bob.

11:50.570 --> 11:52.709
As in hoochie-coochie girls?

11:52.750 --> 11:54.706
Didn't I tell you this
smelled rotten?

11:54.750 --> 11:56.615
There's nothing wrong with
a burlesque show.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.570
Takes all sorts.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.530
All sorts of loose women.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.458
And don't tell me you
disagree. You're the one,
came running to warn us.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.718
Because I know it's something
Kate would never do.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.719
Yeah you got that right.
There's got to be another
way to be a singer.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.500
Don't I get a say?

12:12.550 --> 12:14.541
Found the tools.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.374
Mrs. Shannon, this is
Regina Harrison.

12:16.430 --> 12:18.375
Didn't I see you at
the plant today?

12:18.430 --> 12:20.773
Sure did.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.469
Yeah I can fix this.

12:24.830 --> 12:27.640
Reggie, I set aside
a place for you.

12:27.700 --> 12:31.215
So you're matron and mother to
the girls under your purview?

12:31.270 --> 12:32.692
I wouldn't go that far.

12:32.750 --> 12:36.004
Reggie needed a place,
and I have space is all.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.790
I'd go that far and further.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.570
A factory built on
the backs of women.

12:40.620 --> 12:42.622
What makes you to work so hard?

12:42.670 --> 12:44.661
Hard work is all I know.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.450
Raised three children,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.412
kept this house together
through the lean years...

12:50.460 --> 12:52.018
And now the war.

12:52.070 --> 12:54.937
I need to stay useful.

12:54.990 --> 12:59.154
And if it should ever end?

12:59.210 --> 13:01.292
Maybe then

13:01.340 --> 13:03.035
it'll be my turn.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.178
Deuce.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.909
You have plans tomorrow night?

13:17.970 --> 13:19.653
No. Why?

13:19.710 --> 13:22.964
I'm entertaining some
military types for dinner

13:23.010 --> 13:25.274
and I could use a hostess.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.106
Mother isn't well enough?

13:27.150 --> 13:28.538
You remember,

13:28.590 --> 13:31.013
she went through this last
time when we lost Laurence.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.709
Except Laurence was her son.
James was...

13:33.760 --> 13:38.322
James was the boy we'd
hoped would shoulder our
family's legacy.

13:43.380 --> 13:47.032
What'll you do if there
never is another James?

13:47.080 --> 13:50.129
You're an attractive girl with
an equally attractive income

13:50.170 --> 13:51.990
for the lucky man
that marries you.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.564
How attractive?

13:53.610 --> 13:55.123
I beg your pardon?

13:55.180 --> 13:58.479
Well, you control the annuity
that Grandad set up for me.

13:58.530 --> 14:01.488
I remember Laurence
controlled his own trust
before he turned twenty.

14:01.530 --> 14:03.088
And I was better at math.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.871
You're well looked after,
if that's your concern.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.569
My concern is that you're
staking my future

14:09.630 --> 14:11.757
on the arrival of
some unknown husband

14:11.800 --> 14:15.190
who may never even materialize.

14:19.110 --> 14:25.413
"Lorna Corbett is a dedicated
employee who's given herself
fully to her job as matron."

14:25.470 --> 14:27.688
Reggie, please,
I'd rather not hear.

14:27.730 --> 14:32.030
"Her tireless work-ethic has
her wearing many hats at
Victory Munitions.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.345
In fact, she does the job of
three at the factory before

14:35.390 --> 14:38.518
going home to cook up
fortifying dinners for
her lodger."

14:38.570 --> 14:40.913
That's me. I'm in the paper.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.135
"It's all in a day's work that
pays Mrs.Corbett..." Oh.

14:45.180 --> 14:46.317
Oh what?

14:46.360 --> 14:49.136
Nothing.

14:49.190 --> 14:52.921
"That pays Mrs.Corbett a
fraction of what her male
counterparts earn."

14:52.970 --> 14:54.699
Of course the men earn more.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.274
Their work is different.
They do the heaw lifting.

14:57.330 --> 15:01.938
They better. We make
eleven hundred a year
to their two grand.

15:03.290 --> 15:05.326
If you're in that revue,
I'll be there.

15:05.380 --> 15:06.631
Ditto.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.762
So you'll have at least
two cheering for you.

15:08.820 --> 15:11.072
Just be sure it's
what you wanna do.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.123
Why does everybody think I
can't be in a... burlesque.

15:14.170 --> 15:17.162
Maybe because you can't say
the word without blushing?

15:17.220 --> 15:20.599
It's a chance to sing on stage.
Everybody starts somewhere.

15:20.650 --> 15:24.529
But, Kate, you do know what
that kind of show actually
entails, right?

15:24.570 --> 15:25.434
Do you, Vera?

15:25.480 --> 15:27.175
I've been once or twice.

15:27.230 --> 15:30.097
It's no great mystery
what those women do.

15:32.580 --> 15:35.094
Can you give me some pointers?

15:35.150 --> 15:36.492
Okay...

15:36.540 --> 15:38.974
but if you get in hot water
with Ivan the Terrible,

15:39.020 --> 15:41.978
don't blame me.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.111
Donald,

15:54.170 --> 15:56.115
these are for the 25-pounders.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.990
You see the difference
in length?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.291
I look blind to you?

15:59.340 --> 16:00.682
No.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.038
So I'm sure you can find
your way to the right ones.

16:03.090 --> 16:05.650
You do it.

16:05.700 --> 16:09.079
Then you'd be doing the job
of four for half my take,

16:09.140 --> 16:12.303
isn't that right?

16:16.060 --> 16:18.665
Even a dope like Donald
earns twice your pay.

16:18.710 --> 16:21.759
The heaviest thing he lifts is
the lead between his ears.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.268
Let's stop worrying about
how the men have it better

16:24.330 --> 16:27.015
and get back to work.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.768
Lorna's right. You're
still making good money.

16:32.810 --> 16:35.688
If you still want that house
you should get it.

16:35.730 --> 16:38.039
Princess, us mere mortals
have to scrimp and save.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.160
Yeah for a down-payment.

16:39.210 --> 16:41.861
I don't know how to
talk to bank men.

16:41.910 --> 16:44.162
Well I've met plenty of them.

16:44.220 --> 16:50.079
Their all suckers for a pretty
girl with a sweet smile.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.700
Would you come with me?

16:54.750 --> 16:58.265
Show me how it's done?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.003
Yes.

17:20.430 --> 17:23.115
Aren't you forgetting
something?

17:23.170 --> 17:24.467
Those are for you,

17:24.520 --> 17:28.126
so you don't forget what
women's work feels like.

17:28.170 --> 17:29.421
Keep walking,
jackass".

17:32.050 --> 17:35.008
Don't pay them any mind, Lorna.

17:35.050 --> 17:37.917
What was that about?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.916
Nothing you need
to worry about.

17:39.970 --> 17:44.088
Marco, please, I
don't understand.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.664
When you were talking
to that reporter

17:46.710 --> 17:49.144
it sounded like you
were never going back,

17:49.190 --> 17:50.623
even after the war.

17:50.670 --> 17:54.151
A great worker, like
you, half a man's pay?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.976
Some of these guys
feel replaceable.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.942
Mr. Cowell, good evening.

18:03.990 --> 18:07.118
Seems you brought the cold
weather with you from Oxford.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.126
Excuse us, please.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.649
You're doing a great job.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.432
So is Cook, I was just
checking in on dinner.

18:13.480 --> 18:17.598
Tell her to set another place
we have a last-minute addition.

18:17.660 --> 18:21.300
Clifford Parry,
my daughter, Gladys.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.444
You may have met. Mr. Parry
oversees security for
Victory Munitions.

18:25.490 --> 18:28.835
I'm disappointed with
myself for not noticing
such a lovely lady.

18:28.890 --> 18:30.494
That's alright, Mr. Parry.

18:30.540 --> 18:35.660
We pretty much all look the same
in our turbans and coveralls.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.449
Burlesque.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.628
Gotta show him what
he's missing.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.808
And then take it away.

18:43.860 --> 18:46.158
Atta girl. Here, give
it a whirl.

18:58.310 --> 18:59.607
Let's do that again.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.049
Are you sure this
is your speed?

19:02.090 --> 19:06.618
I'm not quitting because I'm
too scared to learn a few
lousy dance-steps.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.480
Well maybe you need
a better teacher.

19:08.530 --> 19:11.055
I'm not exactly an expert.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.013
But you've got allure
like nobody's business.

19:15.060 --> 19:18.018
We're not here to
build my spirits.

19:20.460 --> 19:26.194
I was always made to believe
that a woman's body was a
vessel of sin.

19:26.250 --> 19:30.027
And you've got this confidence,

19:30.080 --> 19:33.595
you know who you are and
to heck with the world.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.551
Honey, I just fake it.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.295
It's all an act.

19:39.350 --> 19:40.999
Now show me yours.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.400
Remember fellows only want
what they can't have.

19:54.450 --> 19:57.408
Yeah, you don't buy the cow...

19:57.450 --> 20:00.055
If you get the
milk for free.

20:16.380 --> 20:19.338
Whatever Rollie Witham is
capable of, he is my father.

20:19.390 --> 20:21.210
You're not enlisting
me against him.

20:21.260 --> 20:24.218
Easy now, we're on the
same side, you and me.

20:24.260 --> 20:28.344
How can I be on your
side when I_don't know
what your Side even is.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.085
It's no big secret what an
explosives factory makes.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.314
We're working on a new
formula, a race with the Nazis.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.828
Small amounts of this stuff
can pack a wallop.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.532
One soldier can carry enough
to blow up a tank

20:40.580 --> 20:43.629
in a tube of toothpaste
or a can of beans.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.456
Beans.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.456
Is that where Father comes in?

20:47.500 --> 20:51.288
We asked him for help and he
told us, whatever it takes.

20:51.330 --> 20:54.117
He did? And what's his profit?

20:54.160 --> 20:55.411
Not a penny.

20:55.470 --> 20:58.337
Tonight, hopefully, we
finalize our arrangement.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.985
Seems you expect
the worst from him.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.292
It's a habit we've
both developed.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.513
You move well between worlds.

21:05.560 --> 21:09.951
It's what attracted us to you.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.139
They'll be looking
for us inside.

21:19.060 --> 21:22.314
You're not shaking your tail
like some Sherry Britton.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.443
Sherry Britton started in
burlesque, but now she's
on Broadway.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.458
Sherry Britton is a sex-pot!

21:28.500 --> 21:30.456
Right and I'm a bore.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.151
No no, you're not.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.987
You're just not
like those girls.

21:36.030 --> 21:39.329
I fought hard to
get my voice back.

21:39.380 --> 21:41.336
What's wrong with
wanting to use it?

21:41.380 --> 21:45.168
You think I'm this meek little
mouse you can keep in a cage?

21:45.210 --> 21:47.337
No! I just don't wanna
see you degrade yourself!

21:47.390 --> 21:49.688
It's not degrading
if I want to do it!

21:49.740 --> 21:51.344
Yes it is.
Says who?

21:51.390 --> 21:52.209
Says me.

21:52.260 --> 21:55.343
I don't want my girl on stage.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.960
Well then maybe I shouldn't
be your girl.

22:00.440 --> 22:03.659
Maybe you shouldn't.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.978
Anothe_r article.
Everyone's in an uproar.

22:11.020 --> 22:13.363
That damned lady-reporter
is stirring the pot.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.809
The men we work for,

22:14.850 --> 22:18.377
do they fully understand
what I do here?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.376
What are we supposed
to do, Lorna?

22:20.420 --> 22:22.376
Give all of your girls raises

22:22.420 --> 22:24.809
because you think you're worth
more than Donald Hiltz?

22:24.860 --> 22:26.555
I never said I was
"worth more."

22:26.600 --> 22:29.899
I'm simply asking why I'm
worth less than a stock-boy.

22:29.950 --> 22:31.736
Our fellows work
plenty hard.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.907
Does Donald risk his
life on the line?

22:33.960 --> 22:35.166
Supervise a team of workers?

22:35.220 --> 22:37.256
Give all his free
hours to this place?

22:37.310 --> 22:38.390
For God's sake, Lorna!

22:38.440 --> 22:39.828
What's more important?

22:39.880 --> 22:43.702
Earning an extra fifty cents
a day, or beating Hitler?

22:43.750 --> 22:46.355
Well, beating Hitler of
course...

22:46.400 --> 22:48.129
Fine.

22:48.190 --> 22:49.350
Get back to work.

22:54.370 --> 22:57.362
So I gotta bat my
eyelashes at this guy?

22:57.410 --> 22:58.843
It wouldn't hurt.

22:58.890 --> 23:01.506
Let him feel like he's
helping a damsel in distress.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.944
How can I help you ladies?

23:06.990 --> 23:09.379
Oh. We're just here
to see Mr. Abbott.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.513
That's me. Christine.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.518
And which of you is
Elizabeth McRae?

23:15.560 --> 23:16.959
Uh... I am.

23:24.620 --> 23:27.134
One-hundred-and-fortty dollars.
Nicely done.

23:27.180 --> 23:29.136
Shows discipline, focus.

23:29.190 --> 23:32.353
That's two years of savings,
doesn't come easy.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.708
But Elizabeth here, is
a determined young woman.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.490
You can definitely trust
her to hold down the fort.

23:37.540 --> 23:40.361
You'd like a loan of $3,700?

23:40.410 --> 23:42.014
Yes, Ma'am.

23:42.070 --> 23:44.152
Means you pay three percent
interest, annually.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.327
You'll do that for
twenty-five years.

23:46.380 --> 23:50.498
Your monthly
payments will be...

23:50.550 --> 23:53.462
Seventeen dollars and
fifty-five cents.

23:53.510 --> 23:54.647
I can cover that.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.863
Don't forget you'll have
to heat the house,

23:56.910 --> 23:58.810
pay electrical, buy insurance.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.338
I'll take tenants to cover
costs...

24:01.390 --> 24:03.699
Lots of gals with good salaries
need places to live.

24:03.740 --> 24:07.301
Until they meet the
right man and marry.

24:07.350 --> 24:10.171
I'm a skilled factory worker,
Ma'am.

24:10.230 --> 24:11.390
That's a valuable trade.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.656
That may be.

24:12.710 --> 24:14.359
But one day, God willing,

24:14.400 --> 24:17.483
the war will end and there
won't be jobs for any of us.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.667
How will you pay the
bank its money then?

24:19.710 --> 24:22.361
I've had a steady job since
I was sixteen years old.

24:22.410 --> 24:25.061
That hardly makes you a
reliable credit risk.

24:25.110 --> 24:26.714
Perhaps if your
father co-signed.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.638
Surely there are other ways for
a woman to establish herself?

24:29.680 --> 24:32.194
She should take
some initiative.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.855
Build a history of credit.
Maybe a car loan?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.856
I take the streetcar.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.378
Here's what you're going
to do, Miss McRae.

24:39.430 --> 24:42.035
Buy Victory Bonds and
wait till the war ends.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.126
Don't give up.

24:43.170 --> 24:44.421
You're a pretty girl,
you'll see.

24:44.480 --> 24:46.436
Dreams do come true.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.868
Mine did.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.660
Looking for more victims for
your series, Mrs.Shannon?

25:03.710 --> 25:05.109
Let me guess.

25:05.150 --> 25:09.143
It was the bit about your salary
that broke your heart?

25:09.200 --> 25:11.589
I trusted you.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.371
I thought you were all
about telling the truth?

25:15.420 --> 25:17.376
Maybe I said things I
shouldn't have.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.945
And I'm sure it'll be a
hit with your readers

25:19.990 --> 25:22.550
but none of it was any
of your business.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.386
That's right,
it's your business.

25:24.430 --> 25:25.556
So why don't you do something?

25:25.610 --> 25:29.478
I'm not you!

25:29.520 --> 25:31.954
Quit trying to turn us
all into pioneers!

25:32.000 --> 25:35.652
You hold deadly weapons
in your hand all day,

25:35.700 --> 25:40.353
and you're telling me you're
scared to knock on a door?

25:40.400 --> 25:42.265
You deserve it, Lorna.

25:48.150 --> 25:50.323
Oh what a night.

25:50.370 --> 25:56.286
Coming up next, a gal that
will really put some snap in
your suspenders.

25:56.330 --> 25:59.936
Coming out now, the one
and only, Miss Roxie.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.313
Gladys - What's wrong Bets?

26:24.360 --> 26:25.611
When the war ends,

26:25.670 --> 26:27.968
I could be earning half
of what I make now.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.669
Don't say that.

26:29.710 --> 26:33.498
I'm sure there'll be
plenty of good jobs for
girls who want them.

26:33.540 --> 26:34.973
Yeah.

26:35.020 --> 26:40.378
Secretaries, teachers,
nurses, nuns... and that.

26:43.950 --> 26:48.466
I'm sorry I dragged you
there, Bets.

26:48.510 --> 26:50.330
It's still a great dream.

26:50.390 --> 26:52.164
Yeah.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.906
Maybe it's time to wake up.

26:59.050 --> 27:02.349
Gladys! I need your shawl for
Kate. Come, come.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.355
I'll be back.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.264
Hi Betty.

27:04.310 --> 27:05.356
Hi.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.756
I feel so naked
in this thing.

27:12.800 --> 27:16.531
IfI had what you had honey,
I'd want the world to know.

27:16.590 --> 27:17.329
Thanks.

27:17.370 --> 27:18.928
You're a life-saver.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.287
Kate, you'll be splendid.

27:22.330 --> 27:23.376
Thanks, Gladys.

27:23.420 --> 27:26.025
Have I got a special
treat for you.

27:26.070 --> 27:30.370
From the newest, steamiest
Andrews sister of them all

27:30.430 --> 27:33.467
Kate Andrews!

27:57.850 --> 28:03.880
I need a man who zips
my zipper

28:03.940 --> 28:09.287
A classic gent,
a real good tipper

28:09.330 --> 28:14.814
Not just a star,
a real big dipper

28:14.860 --> 28:19.388
Baby, that's the man I need

28:19.430 --> 28:20.249
[Soldiers heckle]

28:20.300 --> 28:22.996
Show the lady some respect!

28:23.040 --> 28:26.737
Who opens my umberlla

28:26.790 --> 28:32.399
Who treats me nice and
plays me like a cello

28:32.440 --> 28:37.707
I need a guy who
bakes my apple pie

28:37.750 --> 28:42.187
Baby, that's the guy I need

28:42.240 --> 28:48.622
Now I don't need a boy
who's trouble

28:48.680 --> 28:54.459
To come around and
burst my bubble

28:54.510 --> 29:00.255
And I don't wanna
hear no socks

29:00.300 --> 29:06.773
Baby, cause I'm the
one who's boss

29:06.830 --> 29:12.132
I need a man who steams
my kettle

29:12.180 --> 29:17.789
So don't be blind
because I need you to see

29:17.840 --> 29:22.618
That baby, you're the
man I need

29:22.670 --> 29:29.621
Yeah baby, you're
the man I need

29:29.680 --> 29:39.635
[Clapping]

29:44.340 --> 29:48.822
[Speaking Italian]

29:48.870 --> 29:50.349
[Knocking at the door]

29:55.530 --> 29:56.827
Vera.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.916
What are you doing here?

29:58.970 --> 30:02.485
I figured if Kate could brave
the stage, I could risk a walk
through Little Italy.

30:02.530 --> 30:03.929
Oh that's right.
Kate's thing.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.312
Oh my God, I forgot.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.624
Thought I might see you there.

30:07.670 --> 30:10.104
Yeah I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to stand you up.

30:10.150 --> 30:12.277
Marco I just wanted to say

30:12.330 --> 30:14.719
I hope you don't quit the plant.

30:14.760 --> 30:18.321
Because I would miss you.
Something fierce.

30:21.380 --> 30:24.338
Oh, I'd miss you too, kid.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.462
Sounds like you're busy.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.865
Yeah a couple paisani
from the neighborhood.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.866
Mind if I join you?

30:31.910 --> 30:34.822
Oh no, of course come in.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.260
Who ordered the mangiacake?

30:46.320 --> 30:49.312
These are my paisani.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.749
What are you palling around
with bootleggers now?

30:51.800 --> 30:53.404
And now you've seen our crime.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.269
Can't let you outta here alive.

30:55.330 --> 30:59.676
Which one of you luclq boys gets
to show me how it's done?

31:02.860 --> 31:05.374
First of all you gotta
say San Marino.

31:05.420 --> 31:07.297
San Marino.

31:07.340 --> 31:11.299
[Laughing]

31:11.340 --> 31:18.599
[Speaking Italian]

31:22.480 --> 31:25.358
San Marino.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.068
It was incredible.

31:38.110 --> 31:40.101
Baby, you take the cake.

31:40.150 --> 31:41.799
How did you do that?

31:41.850 --> 31:43.579
I don't know.

31:43.640 --> 31:49.590
When I'm in the song, I
guess I forget to be afraid.

32:04.310 --> 32:06.175
I was an ass.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.825
Yeah, you were.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.871
But you showed up tonight.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.968
Boy am I glad I did.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.840
Oh my...

32:19.890 --> 32:21.972
I know it's a lousy ring.

32:22.020 --> 32:29.279
But I promise I will buy you a
rock big as the moon, as soon
I can afford it.

32:30.330 --> 32:33.117
Kate,

32:33.160 --> 32:35.037
will you be my wife?

32:36.650 --> 32:38.459
This is so sudden,
I wasn't expecting...

32:38.520 --> 32:41.125
I wanna take care of you.

32:41.170 --> 32:46.301
I wanna make it so you'll
never have to worry about
anything ever again.

32:46.350 --> 32:49.001
The way you feel when you're
singing, like anythings
possible?

32:49.050 --> 32:53.658
That's how you make me feel,
all the time.

32:53.710 --> 32:56.793
Great things lie ahead for us,
Kate.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.569
Great things.

33:10.550 --> 33:14.850
You're right, Ivan.
Great things.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.418
All this hard work for something
you could grab for nickels at
the liquor board?

33:25.480 --> 33:27.698
This one has heart.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.298
And kick.

33:29.350 --> 33:32.342
Wait until Easter.

33:32.400 --> 33:36.871
It's good to see you having fun.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.229
You know,

33:39.270 --> 33:42.273
My dad use to make wine
with his friends.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.882
I used to think it was
old-country, but look at me now.

33:46.930 --> 33:48.841
These are your people.

33:48.890 --> 33:52.189
It's good to see who
you are around them

33:53.500 --> 33:56.242
Thank you for sticking around,
braving it out.

33:56.290 --> 34:00.374
Brave?
Brave is Kate doing Burlesque.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.502
Oh that's right.
Can't believe the kid delivered.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.118
She was well-schooled.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.512
Hmm.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.165
Are you calling down
my teaching skills?

34:08.220 --> 34:09.642
I'm just saying,

34:09.690 --> 34:13.046
Sse should have asked me is all.

34:13.090 --> 34:18.266
I have seen more than my
fair share of these shows.

34:18.310 --> 34:22.781
And believe you me, I have
paid plenty attention to
their technique.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.536
I don't doubt that.

34:25.580 --> 34:28.185
Take note, Miss Burr.

34:54.700 --> 34:55.564
Oh no.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.614
Admit it, your heart's
going thumpity.

35:06.660 --> 35:09.925
Shut up, you bird-brain.

35:09.970 --> 35:11.278
Make me.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.148
Oh, hold on a second.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.851
Vera, are you sure
you wanna do this?

35:26.900 --> 35:30.165
Do I look like I'm
having doubts?

35:40.050 --> 35:42.564
Thanks again for helping
me the other night.

35:42.610 --> 35:43.565
You were perfect.

35:43.610 --> 35:45.009
You close your big deal?

35:45.050 --> 35:48.918
It wasn't business, I was
just building contacts.

35:48.970 --> 35:51.268
I should get ready
for my shift.

35:57.110 --> 35:58.975
I'm proud of you, Gladys.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.410
For getting up every day
and going to that plant.

36:02.460 --> 36:07.193
The other girls there have no
idea what their future holds.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.980
Nor do I, because you
keep me in the dark.

36:10.030 --> 36:13.727
I don't need a crystal
ball to see you're about
to ask me for something.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.941
Control over my own trust.

36:15.990 --> 36:17.639
I'm the only heir you have,

36:17.690 --> 36:20.124
and protecting me from the
world won't help me a lick.

36:20.170 --> 36:21.865
You see yourself as my heir?

36:21.910 --> 36:23.434
Why shouldn't I?

36:23.480 --> 36:25.869
I'm your only child.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.435
Look, I'm asking for a test-run.
I won't touch the principal.

36:29.490 --> 36:32.914
Just let me prove that
I can do this.

36:32.970 --> 36:34.744
All right.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.609
The interest is no
king's ransom,

36:36.670 --> 36:40.447
but I am curious to see how you
deal with the responsibility.

36:42.540 --> 36:44.622
Thank you, Daddy.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.934
Off to work we go.

36:48.980 --> 36:49.981
Yup.

36:53.160 --> 36:57.597
Hey, Lorna, you make
this meatloaf?

36:57.650 --> 37:00.687
'Cause if this is the stuff you
made for that reporter,

37:00.740 --> 37:03.163
it tastes like cow-pie.

37:03.220 --> 37:06.178
[Laughing]

37:06.220 --> 37:08.609
Or is "cook" not one
of the jobs

37:08.660 --> 37:11.003
you do around here
for half our take?

37:11.050 --> 37:14.838
[Laughing]

37:14.880 --> 37:16.962
Well, Donald?

37:17.010 --> 37:18.318
If you can't eat it,

37:18.360 --> 37:19.611
wear it.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.975
You gonna let them do this?

37:46.040 --> 37:46.813
Moron.

37:49.610 --> 37:51.953
If you think you
can replace me,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.308
then set to it.

37:53.350 --> 37:55.306
Plenty of factories,
hurting for good workers.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.009
I could go somewhere else.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.484
You wouldn't have
the guts to walk.

38:02.230 --> 38:03.834
Try me.

38:08.630 --> 38:09.494
Kate?

38:14.160 --> 38:16.458
It's on the right finger,
Betty.

38:16.510 --> 38:19.024
By which I mean the left.

38:19.070 --> 38:20.947
The Slav?

38:20.990 --> 38:24.118
Gosh, he's not wasting
time, is he?

38:24.170 --> 38:26.775
Helmmswhathe
wanisoutofilfe

38:26.820 --> 38:29.345
and that's very appealing.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.029
Sure you're ready to
take the plunge?

38:33.610 --> 38:35.828
He's a sweet guy.

38:35.870 --> 38:37.918
And he loves me.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.968
Do you love him?

38:47.020 --> 38:48.009
Yeah.

38:48.060 --> 38:52.451
I'm happy for you,
Kate Andrews.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.019
It's great news.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.801
Marco - It's crazy at
the factory, I can't stand it.

39:02.860 --> 39:06.330
I figured since we grew up in
the same line of work,

39:06.380 --> 39:10.589
maybe you could use extra hand
around the fireworks shop?

39:10.650 --> 39:15.519
I couldn't pay you half of what
you're pulling at the factory.

39:15.570 --> 39:16.958
You know anyone that could?

39:17.000 --> 39:18.046
Guys I know,

39:18.090 --> 39:20.399
they'd kill for your job.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.829
I just keep choking
on my self-respect, you know?

39:22.880 --> 39:26.702
Stop looking at your job like
you're fighting the war.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.399
It's a paycheque, Marco,

39:28.450 --> 39:30.350
and a damned good one.

39:30.410 --> 39:38.579
IfI don't quit, I'm gotta have
to find some other way to stand
up straight.

39:38.630 --> 39:41.235
This is why I love you.

39:41.290 --> 39:42.848
You're proud.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.028
I know some guys,
got the same problem.

39:46.070 --> 39:47.469
You should meet 'em.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.687
You're in a tunnel, my friend.

39:51.730 --> 39:54.460
Let me shine a little light.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.418
Chin, Chin

39:59.130 --> 40:04.136
Now, this one, I call my
"alone-in-a-hotel-room" special.

40:04.180 --> 40:07.001
The best part,
is the egg-white.

40:07.050 --> 40:08.483
On really rough nights,

40:08.530 --> 40:11.658
you can convince
yourself that it's dinner.

40:11.710 --> 40:12.870
There.

40:12.930 --> 40:14.534
Whiskey sour.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.536
You didn't need to do this.

40:16.580 --> 40:17.979
Oh, I felt horrible,

40:18.020 --> 40:20.102
for making a mess
outta your life.

40:20.150 --> 40:23.881
You said I was gonna
cause trouble and I did.

40:23.940 --> 40:30.152
What if Mr. Aikins
replaces me?

40:30.210 --> 40:31.336
Well,

40:31.380 --> 40:34.167
then you'll have a
little bit more freedom.

40:34.210 --> 40:37.998
[Laughing]

40:38.040 --> 40:39.428
A little bit too much.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.472
You know you gotta fight
for what you want, Lorna.

40:42.520 --> 40:44.568
Really, I mean,

40:44.610 --> 40:48.694
I've interviewed heads of
state and I'm still fighting
with blowhards like Aikins.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.526
Extra money, that's selfish.

40:51.570 --> 40:52.355
No.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.004
What about the other girls?

40:54.060 --> 40:56.620
Well, someone has to be the
first through the door.

40:56.670 --> 41:00.492
The other girls will follow.

41:00.540 --> 41:04.499
My husband...

41:04.540 --> 41:07.668
hated when I first
started working.

41:07.720 --> 41:09.028
Really?

41:09.070 --> 41:11.891
And how does he feel
about that now?

41:14.120 --> 41:15.508
Can I have...

41:15.560 --> 41:18.814
Yeah maybe I'll just fill
that up for you, Lorna.

41:18.860 --> 41:21.681
Listen, you know my
husband Neville,

41:21.740 --> 41:25.904
he lets me be,
who I need to be.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.861
There are as many paths as
there are men.

41:28.920 --> 41:34.438
You just have to make sure
you're both travelling in the
same direction.

41:34.490 --> 41:36.879
Here's to you, Lorna.

41:43.580 --> 41:45.719
You're a good worker, Lorna.

41:45.760 --> 41:49.548
This has been very
difficult for me.

41:49.590 --> 41:52.548
Thirty-five cents a day raise.

41:52.590 --> 41:54.546
It's not the fifty you wanted,

41:54.590 --> 41:57.150
but it's better than the
toe of my boot,

41:57.210 --> 41:59.633
which the higher-ups
thought I should give ya.

41:59.690 --> 42:01.681
You changed their
minds on my behalf?

42:01.730 --> 42:08.124
I made sure they knew, this
place could use you
sticking around.

42:08.170 --> 42:11.788
And this raise it's
for all the girls?

42:11.830 --> 42:14.219
Just you.

42:14.270 --> 42:16.079
Unless you'd rather not.

42:16.140 --> 42:18.961
No, someone has to be the
first through the door.

42:19.010 --> 42:21.797
I'll take it, Mr. Aikins.
Thank you.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.796
I, uh....

42:23.840 --> 42:28.539
I expect you won't mention
this to the rest of the girls.

42:28.580 --> 42:31.708
I wouldn't expect
that if I were you.

42:36.550 --> 42:39.678
The loan of $50 matures
in 18 months.

42:39.730 --> 42:42.551
No concer_ns there. I won't
be spending a dime of it.

42:42.600 --> 42:46.206
You'll need to make the
scheduled re-payments
with interest.

42:46.250 --> 42:48.252
Proving that I'm a
decent credit-risk.

42:48.300 --> 42:48.994
I get it.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.642
You prove yourself small here,
Miss McRae,

42:52.700 --> 42:54.827
there may be a mortgage
for you.

42:54.870 --> 42:56.258
That's the idea.

42:57.960 --> 43:04.570
"Dear Bob, believe it or not,
that's your wife in the paper."

43:04.620 --> 43:09.660
"If that weren't wonders
enough, seems I received a
small raise."

43:09.710 --> 43:12.588
"Strange, writing you
like this,"

43:12.630 --> 43:15.190
"my first since you
fought overseas."

43:18.240 --> 43:21.198
"The things in life
that happened then"

43:21.250 --> 43:26.028
"they didn't feel like they
really happened until I
shared them with you."

43:27.600 --> 43:32.299
"I wonder, do you
miss me out there?"

43:32.340 --> 43:34.558
"I hope so."

43:34.610 --> 43:36.692
"Love, Lorna."
