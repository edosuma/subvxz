WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.364
Previously on Elementary...
I've done something new
to anger you.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.197
You didn't mention
you were the target

00:06.240 --> 00:08.800
of a failed
assassrnation attempt

00:08.840 --> 00:11.331
which left a woman
named Sabine dead.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.076
I was right.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.338
Two years ago, he thought
I was behind his near-murder.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.472
And now?

00:15.510 --> 00:16.704
According to him,

00:16.750 --> 00:18.479
I am a former suspect

00:18.510 --> 00:20.671
and I am not at the center
of an elaborate revenge plot.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.813
Sabine and I were...
very close.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.318
The would-be assassin
has been dealt with.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.783
Well, you're lying,

00:26.820 --> 00:28.651
so I'll just have to investigate
the matter myself.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.095
(wind howling)

00:34.560 --> 00:36.562
(dramatic music playing)

00:42.240 --> 00:45.061
(woman screaming)

00:45.110 --> 00:46.509
(doorbell rings)
(gasps)

00:46.540 --> 00:48.201
(French accent):
Hey, it's okay, Frosty.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.439
WATSON:
Hi, I'm so sorry
to bother you,

00:52.480 --> 00:54.573
but my car broke down up
the road and my phone died.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.509
Oh, Mon Die Of all the nights.
I know.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.484
Feel like an idiot. Do you think
I could use your phone

00:59.520 --> 01:01.078
to call my friend
to come and pick me up?

01:01.120 --> 01:03.088
Uh...

01:03.130 --> 01:04.449
Of course. Come in.

01:04.490 --> 01:06.253
Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.653
Oh.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.168
You're so cute.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.519
Oh, this is Frosty.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.561
I'm Soleil.
I'm, uh,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.090
I'm Nicolette.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.801
Uh, here.
The phone is in the study.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.308
Uh, I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

01:19.340 --> 01:21.137
Only The Creature
from the Black Lagoon.

01:21.180 --> 01:23.569
My favorite show
got preempted by hockey.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.601
Uh, you want
a cup of tea?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.675
Oh. That's so nice, thank you.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.187
Yeah.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.511
(light clattering)

01:41.730 --> 01:44.221
(door opens)

01:44.270 --> 01:45.498
SOLEIL:
Keep warm!

01:45.530 --> 01:46.531
Thanks so much.

01:46.570 --> 01:47.832
Bye!

01:53.580 --> 01:55.571
(engine running)

01:58.850 --> 02:00.340
"Nicolette"?

02:00.380 --> 02:02.689
Everyone within
100 miles of Montreal

02:02.720 --> 02:04.449
has a sew French name.

02:04.490 --> 02:06.458
Would've been suspicious
if I didn't.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.219
What'd you find?

02:08.260 --> 02:09.659
Soleil is a dutiful daughter.

02:09.690 --> 02:10.759
She's kept her mother's letters,

02:10.790 --> 02:12.223
her will
and some other mementos.

02:12.260 --> 02:13.591
Hopefully,
the answers lie within.

02:13.630 --> 02:15.757
If not, I shall resort
to a sance

02:15.800 --> 02:17.267
to interrogate
Sabine Raoult.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.597
You can't be that sure

02:18.630 --> 02:20.234
that your father's girlfriend
set him up.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.567
She died in the attack.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.739
Well, perhaps that's
a convenient outcome

02:23.770 --> 02:25.601
_for_ whoever _
commISSIoned the crime.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.732
(sighs)

02:30.550 --> 02:32.541
(games beep, man screams)

02:37.690 --> 02:38.941
(door rattles)

02:38.990 --> 02:41.652
*

02:41.690 --> 02:42.827
(grunts)

02:42.860 --> 02:43.849
(speaking Chinese)

03:10.550 --> 03:12.916
*

03:16.590 --> 03:18.729
HOLMES:
Excuse me, excuse me.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.751
Thank you, sorry. Thank you.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.967
That's quite an audience today.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.968
If it wasn't for
the lack of paparazzi,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.662
I'd assume a reality TV
star got vivisected.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.509
Three Chinese gangsters
got shotgunned.

03:30.540 --> 03:31.802
So less fun.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.808
These folks are nervous.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.330
They're worried this could be
the beginning of a gang war.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.449
What do you think?

03:36.480 --> 03:37.799
I'd have a better idea

03:37.850 --> 03:39.340
if I knew what
he was thinking.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.473
That's Meng Zhou,
in the hat over there.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.444
He's the head of
the Snake Eye Boys.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.458
Second largest
Triad in the city.

03:46.490 --> 03:47.980
It's his guys
on the ground in there.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.329
And who is Mr. Meng
likely to blame?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.520
Ghost Mountain.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.255
Another Triad, just
came to the States.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.949
They control a few blocks
near Columbus Park.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.719
Beat cops say there's
been some friction.

03:57.770 --> 04:00.364
We were afraid of
something like this.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.459
(games beeping, whirring)

04:05.510 --> 04:07.603
The arcade is co-owned
by the three victims.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.438
Their rap sheets
are all over the map.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.448
When they weren't
scamming credit cards

04:12.480 --> 04:14.345
and insurance companies,
they were running

04:14.380 --> 04:15.745
illegal drugs
and protection rackets.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.941
Sound like big earners.

04:17.990 --> 04:19.810
Yeah. That's why

04:19.860 --> 04:22.954
retribution will probably be
fast and bloody.

04:22.990 --> 04:25.629
We need to make a collar
on this ASAP,

04:25.660 --> 04:27.958
or this whole neighborhood
could blow up.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.389
So I count three blood spatters,
two victims, one knife.

04:30.430 --> 04:32.637
The last guy managed
to get his switchblade out.

04:32.670 --> 04:35.434
We think he got winged,
made it around the corner

04:35.470 --> 04:37.609
before the killer
caught up with him.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.938
I take it_ there were
no Witnesses?

04:39.980 --> 04:42.949
Uh, we canvassed, talked
to a few people who heard shots,

04:42.980 --> 04:44.470
looked out
their windows.

04:44.510 --> 04:45.738
One couple
saw a jogger.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.441
Someone else saw
a little old woman

04:47.480 --> 04:49.641
hightailing it away
from the gunfire. That's it.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.454
Well, there are
no surveillance cameras.

04:52.490 --> 04:53.752
That's not surprising,

04:53.790 --> 04:55.655
considering what this
place was used for.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.449
Is this MDMA?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.456
That's $25,000 worth.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.821
They kept their stash
in a safe behind the counter.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.668
So the killer
couldn't break the lock?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.395
I don't think he touched it.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.431
Whatever this was,
it wasn't a robbery.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.700
HOLMES: Uh, I think it
might have been a betrayal.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.401
Ambush by an ally.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.577
What makes you say that?

05:15.610 --> 05:18.101
There's sodium bicarbonate here,

05:18.150 --> 05:19.572
lying in a pool

05:19.620 --> 05:21.611
of dried expectoration.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.789
The killer put a fizzy
pain reliever in his mouth

05:23.820 --> 05:25.617
to fake a seizure.

05:25.650 --> 05:26.878
To lure the victims to his aid.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.582
They opened up, he opened fire.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.598
They couldn't have been
fooled by a stranger?

05:32.630 --> 05:37.624
This man put a 9 and a 1 in his
phone just before he was shot.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.898
I don't think he would've
brought the police

05:38.930 --> 05:40.761
and the paramedics
to his drug-slinging pit

05:40.800 --> 05:43.064
if it wasn't for someone

05:43.110 --> 05:44.566
he personally
cared for.
So the trigger man

05:44.610 --> 05:47.078
was probably a Snake Eye,
same as the victims.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.634
So he switched
allegiances

05:48.680 --> 05:49.806
and now he's working
with Ghost Mountain?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.647
Hard theory to test.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.147
Like I said,
Ghost Mountain's new.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.738
We don't have anyone plugged

05:54.780 --> 05:55.974
into their drama.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.988
There are other ways
to ascertain

05:58.020 --> 05:59.954
whether Ghost Mountain has
cultivated a double agent

05:59.990 --> 06:01.878
in their enemy's organization.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.559
(speaking Chinese)

06:04.590 --> 06:06.694
*

06:06.730 --> 06:09.028
Mr. Xi, we are consultants
with the NYPD.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.493
Do you have a minute?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.794
(speaks Chinese)

06:12.840 --> 06:15.400
Who are you looking for?

06:15.440 --> 06:17.658
You.
Xi Hai Ching.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.507
The so-called "489"

06:19.540 --> 06:21.007
of the Ghost Mountain Triad.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.600
Everyone on this block
pays you protection, Mr. Xi,

06:23.650 --> 06:24.844
there's no sense denying it.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.074
I do deny it.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.873
There's no one
here named XI.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.889
The department has been keeping
an eye on you since June.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.889
We may not have all the
information we want about you,

06:33.920 --> 06:36.718
but we do know
your name.

06:36.760 --> 06:38.523
HOLMES:
Three members of
the Snake Eye Boys

06:38.560 --> 06:40.551
were ambushed at
an arcade last night.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.797
We suspect you paid one of their
fellows to double-cross them.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.993
I am not leader
of Ghost Mountain.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.769
I never hear of Ghost Mountain.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.038
I only speak for myself.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.072
Well, you'd be
wise to do so,

06:54.110 --> 06:56.544
'cause as we see it,

06:56.580 --> 06:58.002
no one stood to benefit more

06:58.050 --> 06:59.677
from the carnage
at Mott Street than you.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.608
WATSON:
We know from your file
you're very hands-on.

07:01.650 --> 07:04.642
Maybe you watched the whole
thing go down last night?

07:04.690 --> 07:06.009
I was with a woman friend
last nIght.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.608
Her husband is out of town.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.628
She's married,

07:09.660 --> 07:11.685
so she won't be able
to back up your story.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.754
XI:
She won't have to.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.688
She got a call from hospital.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.459
Her nephew.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.990
He was beaten and mugged.

07:18.030 --> 07:19.634
We went there to be with him.

07:19.670 --> 07:20.989
Which one?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.634
St. Bede's. Go there.

07:23.670 --> 07:25.001
Ask them
if you don't believe me.

07:26.140 --> 07:28.608
This is a dangerous
neighborhood.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.039
The police cannot keep us safe.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.011
If people have
to pay for protection,

07:33.050 --> 07:35.712
maybe you should blame yourself.

07:38.190 --> 07:40.750
I'll check his alibi

07:40.790 --> 07:42.018
while you comb
through his cell phone.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.550
You saw that lift?

07:43.590 --> 07:44.784
You swapped it out
for a duplicate, right?

07:44.830 --> 07:46.798
With malware and a dead battery.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.048
Should give me enough time
to review his call history,

07:49.100 --> 07:51.159
flesh out the Ghost Mountain
family tree.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.737
With any luck, I should
find the Snake Eye mole

07:53.770 --> 07:55.192
before he has time
to sound the alarm

07:55.240 --> 07:57.538
and they all swap out
their burners.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.777
(speaking Chinese)

08:02.780 --> 08:03.906
Mmm.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.178
(speaks Chinese)

08:07.950 --> 08:10.145
(doorbell buzzing)

08:10.190 --> 08:11.248
(lock clicks)

08:13.760 --> 08:16.888
Wasn't aware you were back
on this side of the globe.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.125
(door closes)

08:19.160 --> 08:20.991
My business brings me
back to this city

08:21.030 --> 08:22.964
more often than I'd like.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.763
My son's behavior
brings me back

08:24.800 --> 08:27.667
to this brownstone
more often than I'd like.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.099
How have I offended now?

08:29.140 --> 08:30.630
Why are you looking into Sabine?

08:30.670 --> 08:32.774
What gave you the idea I am?

08:32.810 --> 08:35.529
I was informed
by the woman you robbed.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.071
Did you really think
that Soleil and I

08:38.110 --> 08:39.816
would not still
be in contact?

08:39.850 --> 08:41.738
That's precisely
what I'd assumed.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.543
After the attack,

08:43.590 --> 08:46.184
she could've blamed me
for her mother's death.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.757
Instead, she prayed
for my recovery.

08:48.790 --> 08:51.088
I owe her answers,

08:51.130 --> 08:53.098
not more grief, so you can
imagine my frustration

08:53.130 --> 08:55.655
when I heard that
her home had been violated

08:55.700 --> 08:57.258
the same night
as she was visited

08:57.300 --> 08:59.939
by a beautiful
but hapless Asian motorist.

08:59.970 --> 09:04.066
Watson and I did not
travel to Quebec on a lark.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.600
Then why did you go?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.870
There's good reason to believe

09:07.910 --> 09:10.242
that Sabine was a party
to the attempt on your life.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.044
Oh, Sherlock...

09:13.080 --> 09:14.672
Perhaps her participation
was unwitting,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.211
perhaps you're just wrong
about her character.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.649
Either way,

09:18.690 --> 09:19.884
the shooter

09:19.920 --> 09:21.581
was far too well-prepared

09:21.620 --> 09:23.019
to strike when and where he did.

09:23.060 --> 09:25.358
He rented a room
above the plaza,

09:25.390 --> 09:27.790
disabled a traffic camera,
mapped his escape route...

09:27.830 --> 09:29.092
All of those facts

09:29.130 --> 09:32.099
are completely at odds
with your assertion

09:32.130 --> 09:33.939
that Sabine chose the restaurant

09:33.970 --> 09:35.767
on the spur of the moment
that evening.

09:37.670 --> 09:38.864
It's impossible.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.299
There is a vast gulf
between "impossible"

09:41.340 --> 09:42.978
and "impossible to imagine."

09:43.010 --> 09:45.069
No.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.249
You've got everything backwards.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.612
I am to blame for
what happened to her.

09:49.650 --> 09:52.289
If we had never met,
she would still be alive today.

09:52.320 --> 09:56.882
Someone I loved was annihilated
because of me.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.080
Well, there's
an overdue sentiment.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.261
To invoke your mother now...

10:09.000 --> 10:11.161
You haven't changed.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.774
I'm not going to stop
looking into Sabine.

10:14.810 --> 10:15.902
She is the key.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.075
Marcus. Hi.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.418
Hey.

10:20.450 --> 10:22.645
Two sugars.
The file you asked for.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.885
I swung by the 14th
on my way in.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.285
Ugh...

10:26.320 --> 10:28.185
You're getting the better
end of this deal.

10:28.220 --> 10:30.950
So Xi Hai Ching was lying
about where he was last night.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.697
No, but I think the assault
he told you about

10:33.730 --> 10:35.948
might be connected
to the three homicides.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.268
Kevin Chang.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.860
So he's the nephew
of Xi's mistress?

10:41.900 --> 10:43.868
Mm-hmm.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.138
Well, it looks like
he got jumped

10:45.170 --> 10:46.979
just two blocks from the arcade.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.979
Yeah, about five minutes after
the shots were fired there.

10:50.010 --> 10:51.375
I get that it's a rough
neighborhood,

10:51.410 --> 10:52.809
but that's a serious
comadence, no?

10:52.850 --> 10:54.841
Keep flipping.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.239
Someone hit him
with a blunt object.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.124
Well, that looks
like it could be

11:04.160 --> 11:05.752
from the stock of a shotgun,
couldn't it?

11:05.790 --> 11:06.950
That's what I thought.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.194
It's about the right size.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.198
So maybe this wasn't
a mugging after all.

11:10.230 --> 11:11.891
Kevin was in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

11:11.930 --> 11:13.466
saw something he
shouldn't have.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.469
The shooter spent all his ammo
blasting the Triad

11:16.500 --> 11:20.300
and had to chase Kevin down
and tried to beat him to death.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.035
Looks like he almost
finished the job.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.868
Last notes say that the doctors
had to put him in a coma

11:25.910 --> 11:28.913
until the swelling
in his brain subsides.

11:28.950 --> 11:30.212
I doubt Kevin will
be able to give us

11:30.250 --> 11:32.810
much of a description
if he wakes up.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.487
But we can talk
to the people who found him.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.919
Maybe they saw the perp
fleeing the scene.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.929
I'll call Sherlock.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.099
MAN:
Yeah, so I was
the third person

11:41.130 --> 11:43.928
to come along
and see the whole mess.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.926
People who found him were
these two homeless guys.

11:45.970 --> 11:49.394
They, uh, didn't have a phone
and they were pretty drunk.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.237
I was walking along
the block there,

11:51.270 --> 11:53.431
and I heard him yell for help,
so I came on over.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.004
What did you see?

11:55.040 --> 11:56.109
Kevin.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.505
That's his name, right?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.939
Yeah, he was just
covered in blood.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.848
Somebody really bashed him,
and he's babbling and...

12:03.890 --> 12:06.381
Wait, he was
still conscious?
Kind of.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.012
He wasn't making much sense.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.186
Said an old lady did it.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.778
What?

12:10.830 --> 12:12.024
Someone who lives
above the arcade said

12:12.060 --> 12:14.324
they saw an old
woman hurrying away

12:14.360 --> 12:16.351
from the scene of the
shooting last night.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.958
You think some little
old lady gunned down

12:18.000 --> 12:19.399
three Chinese gangsters

12:19.430 --> 12:22.035
and then caved Kevin Chang's
skull in with a shotgun?

12:22.070 --> 12:24.038
HOLMES: Watson is correct
that the crimes were committed

12:24.070 --> 12:26.038
by the same person.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.231
But I don't think that person
was an elderly woman.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.910
Might have looked like
an elderly woman, though.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.928
(door opens)

12:43.960 --> 12:46.087
(footsteps approach)

12:46.130 --> 12:47.256
Have a seat.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.825
What is this?

12:49.870 --> 12:53.260
I will not be in the same
room with this man.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.097
Since you both have
sworn up and down

12:55.140 --> 12:56.937
that you're just
simple shopkeeps,

12:56.970 --> 12:59.564
_I don't see the harm in
a little conversation. Do you?

12:59.610 --> 13:02.033
We thought you
should know

13:02.080 --> 13:05.345
that your gangs don't need
to go to war after all.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.349
Mr. Meng, we're almost positive
Mr. Xi's organization

13:08.380 --> 13:10.211
had nothing to do
with the arcade killings.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.888
"Almost."

13:11.920 --> 13:14.115
Yeah, it depends
on whether or not

13:14.160 --> 13:18.028
there's any bak gwei in Ghost
Mountain or the Snake Eye Boys.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.858
A white man? In a Triad?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.460
That's what we thought.
BELL:
We found the murder weapon.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.889
It was used to beat a man
named KeVIn Chang senseless

13:25.930 --> 13:27.329
just two blocks
from the arcade.

13:27.370 --> 13:30.168
That's your girlfriend's
nephew, right?

13:30.210 --> 13:32.974
Well, uh, that's a
coincidence. Sort of.

13:33.010 --> 13:36.377
Kevin, as you probably know,
is a suspected mugger himself.

13:36.410 --> 13:39.299
Or at least he's a person
of interest in a few open cases.

13:39.350 --> 13:41.318
Looks like last night
he made the mistake

13:41.350 --> 13:43.079
of trying to rob
a killer on the run.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.510
The beating he ended up
taking attracted attention,

13:46.550 --> 13:51.123
so the shooter decided
to... ditch his stuff.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.391
We found this mask
hidden in the same spot.

13:54.430 --> 13:57.228
It's made _of silicone
and mortICIan's putty.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.068
Usually the putty is used to
cover injuries on dead bodies,

14:00.100 --> 14:03.558
but obviously it can be utilized
in mask-making as well.

14:03.610 --> 14:06.431
There were several brown
Cauca5ian eyebrow hairs

14:06.470 --> 14:08.028
stuck to the back.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.049
The hairs are
a preliminary DNA match

14:11.080 --> 14:14.811
for a half-chewed seltzer tablet
that we found at the arcade.

14:18.690 --> 14:21.659
Captain, just what
are you saying?

14:23.690 --> 14:27.091
look like an old Chinese woman
and faked a seizure.

14:27.130 --> 14:30.122
That's why your guys dropped
their guard and came to his aid.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.320
And were gunned down
for their trouble.

14:32.370 --> 14:35.066
My condolences.

14:37.070 --> 14:39.265
All right. Thank you.

14:39.310 --> 14:41.676
Sounds like everybody's come
out of their bunkers.

14:41.710 --> 14:43.678
Patrol cops in Chinatown
saw Ghost Mountain

14:43.710 --> 14:46.679
and Snake Eye members
out and about last night.

14:46.710 --> 14:49.679
Always great to get criminals
back out on the street.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.688
Well, it's what we want.
This time.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.517
No shots fired.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.152
Looks like the peace
will hold,

14:55.190 --> 14:57.556
unless the master of disguise
decides to strike again.

14:57.590 --> 15:00.559
I assure you there's no such
thing as a master of disguise.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.397
If there was,
I'd be one myself.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.091
Of course
you would.

15:04.130 --> 15:05.529
You scoff, but I did
drama at school.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.698
I was quite adept
with prosthetics and wigs,

15:09.740 --> 15:11.537
but I learned that
they have their limits.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.379
A plan to infiltrate
a dining club

15:13.410 --> 15:15.708
in the guise of a loathed rival
was a spectacular failure.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.277
You think maybe this adult
killer is somehow

15:18.310 --> 15:20.278
even more skilled _
than you were as a child?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.117
I doubt it.

15:22.150 --> 15:23.947
Let's say he was
to impersonate you.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.946
Adopting your appearance
would not be enough.

15:25.990 --> 15:27.582
He'd have to mimic your gait,

15:27.620 --> 15:29.588
your vocal inflection,
your very scent.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.588
I doubt even
the most skilled actor

15:31.630 --> 15:33.598
with the most
sophisticated makeup

15:33.630 --> 15:36.963
could pass for an imbecile's
distant acquaintance.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.969
And yet, according to you, our
perp tricked three Triad members

15:40.000 --> 15:41.729
into letting him
into their arcade.

15:41.770 --> 15:43.738
He was seen at night
through a dirty window

15:43.770 --> 15:46.978
whilst foaming at the mouth
and pretending to seize.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.170
All of this contributed
to their ability

15:48.210 --> 15:51.179
to pass for Bai May-Lung.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.178
And who is
Bai May-Lung?

15:53.220 --> 15:58.089
The Snake Eye Boys
called Bai "Grandmother."

15:58.120 --> 16:00.315
Her deceased husband was
a Triad lieutenant.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.080
He used his wife's hair salon
to launder money.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.529
She just finished
a three-year bid

16:05.560 --> 16:07.528
at A_|bion Correctional
SIX months ago.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.152
Revered by the three victims
for her service

16:09.200 --> 16:11.498
and unsuspecting in the extreme,
she's perfect.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.498
I'm sold.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.100
Why don't you two go have a
chat with her, see if she has

16:16.140 --> 16:18.233
any idea who would have
wanted to impersonate her.

16:18.270 --> 16:22.434
Respectfully, Mrs. Bai served
a prison sentence in her 705

16:22.480 --> 16:24.368
rather than cooperate
with the state.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.241
She won't talk to anyone
with a badge.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.441
So I already dispatched
Watson to her home

16:28.480 --> 16:31.085
at Willowbrook Assisted Living.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.384
And, hopefully, that should
make things go more smoothly.
WOMAN: Get out.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.388
I said get out.
Ma'am. Ma'am, the reason
I want to talk to you

16:35.420 --> 16:37.354
about Snake Eye Triad...
(shouts in Chinese)

16:37.390 --> 16:39.984
Okay, that's
not very nice.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.769
Look, three of your
husband's old gang members

16:44.800 --> 16:47.189
were shot to death
the other night.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.196
Do you want that person
brought to justice or not?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.231
They will be.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.079
Your friend Meng Zhou
isn't so certain.

16:53.110 --> 16:55.078
This wasn't
Triad business.

16:55.110 --> 16:56.702
The killer was
a white man.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.549
He got close
to the three victims

16:58.580 --> 17:00.138
by disguising
himself as you.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.738
(mutters in Chinese)

17:01.780 --> 17:04.647
He made that.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.487
He dressed like you.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.080
Might not seem like much,

17:09.120 --> 17:12.123
but it was enough to fool
the men that were killed.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.329
You know who did it, don't you?

17:20.370 --> 17:24.329
Two weeks ago, there was
a photographer here.

17:24.370 --> 17:26.235
White man.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.204
He say I need
Willowbrook ID.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.242
He took pictures.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.215
Then he want to know
about Snake Eye Boys.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.842
Had you seen him before?

17:34.880 --> 17:37.849
No. I go in bathroom to call
the front, "Get him out."

17:37.890 --> 17:40.358
But I come back, he left.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.357
Pervert stole
my laundry.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.755
He took your clothes?

17:42.790 --> 17:44.257
It was in a
basket there.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.258
My nice jacket,
bras, everything.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.497
What did he look like?

17:48.530 --> 17:51.419
White man, brown hair.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.199
Anything else?

17:53.240 --> 17:55.538
No, I don't see good anymore.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.358
White man, brown hair.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.207
Still waiting to talk
to the administrator.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.308
He's wrapping
up a meeting.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.772
In the middle
of a heated negotiation

18:06.810 --> 18:08.414
with a tapioca vendor, no doubt.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.259
Can you imagine being
king of this castle?

18:13.290 --> 18:15.349
I feel worse for the
residents who live here.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.324
Not even Bai May-Lung deserves

18:17.360 --> 18:19.328
to be preyed on by
these faux charities.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.351
How can you doubt
the authenticity

18:21.400 --> 18:22.753
of an organization
which has provided

18:22.800 --> 18:25.792
at least one Ping-Pong table
to a middle school?

18:25.830 --> 18:27.366
_Wherever there's _
an immigrant community,

18:27.400 --> 18:28.799
_ there are these _
neighborhood organizations

18:28.840 --> 18:30.808
funneling cash
into gangsters' pockets.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.808
You think the Chinatown
Community Outreach

18:32.840 --> 18:33.829
is a Triad creation?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.279
They're trying to trick people

18:35.310 --> 18:36.709
into leaving them money
when they die.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.605
MAN:
Hey there.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.618
Hi. Michael Haas.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.140
Michael Haas.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.148
My assistant gave me the gist.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.159
Uh, you-you think we had a
killer in our midst, huh? Wow.

18:47.190 --> 18:48.487
Yes "
, wow."

18:48.520 --> 18:50.158
We're hoping that
the culprit might appear

18:50.190 --> 18:51.782
on your security footage.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.798
Um, I notice you don't have
any cameras in this hallway,

18:53.830 --> 18:55.195
but the one
over by the front door,

18:55.230 --> 18:56.652
that-that would be sufficient.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.224
Actually, that's just
closed circuit.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.623
It doesn't record.

18:59.670 --> 19:02.491
At night, we have
a security guard at the desk.

19:02.540 --> 19:06.169
He can see anyone who's coming,
buzz 'em in if it's all good.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.700
But that's it.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.401
So would-be murderers are only
free to roam the halls

19:09.440 --> 19:10.702
and _harass _the residents
during busmess hours?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.377
WATSON:
Ms. Bai said that her visitor

19:12.410 --> 19:14.378
was a white man
who claimed to work here.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.944
Maybe you could show us
where you keep your files.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.538
It would be helpful for us

19:17.590 --> 19:19.888
to look at employee records,
vendors with access.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.285
I wish I could.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.719
You are the boss, right?

19:22.760 --> 19:25.320
Sure, but my people have
privacy rights.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.591
Without a... a warrant, uh,
I wouldn't feel comfortable.

19:28.630 --> 19:30.188
But, listen, it doesn't matter.

19:30.230 --> 19:31.629
This guy doesn't work here.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.262
I can tell you
that right now.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.289
How?

19:34.340 --> 19:35.398
We've got 25 people on staff.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.203
Except for me,

19:37.240 --> 19:39.731
everybody's either Jamaican,
Salvadoran or Chinese.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.328
No white men.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.268
Uh, that's just
the way it worked out.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.948
We signed a visitor log
when we arrived.

19:44.980 --> 19:47.448
Is there anything else the
killer would have had to provide

19:47.480 --> 19:48.674
in order to gain access?

19:48.720 --> 19:52.508
Sorry, I mean,
Willowbrook is not a prison.

19:52.550 --> 19:55.781
But you can make a copy
of that log if you want.

19:58.460 --> 20:01.429
HOLMES: Which dead gangster
do you want to start with?

20:01.460 --> 20:03.428
Uh, Adam Tsai.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.428
Looks like he might have
been the first one shot.

20:06.470 --> 20:09.462
So who do you want,
Ray Mui or Gao Chung Pei?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.309
Flip a coin.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.500
Casting about
their criminal histories

20:12.540 --> 20:13.939
for clues of
the killer's identity

20:13.980 --> 20:15.333
seems a very,
very broad approach

20:15.380 --> 20:17.007
for such a specific crime.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.440
I don't see where else
we're gonna get traction.

20:19.480 --> 20:21.471
I mean, we have that copy
of the Willowbrook visitor log,

20:21.520 --> 20:23.317
but it's not like the guy
would have signed in

20:23.350 --> 20:25.318
with his _real name
to see Bai May-Lung.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.750
Plus half those signatures
are illegible scribbles.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.886
What are you gonna do
with Soleil's hatbox over there?

20:31.930 --> 20:34.626
Its contents proved
to be entirely useless,

20:34.660 --> 20:37.026
so I'm returning it
to my father tomorrow.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.493
He's in town?

20:38.530 --> 20:42.364
Found out about what we did.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.368
It would appear he's a much
more involved father

20:44.410 --> 20:45.809
to the daughter he never had

20:45.840 --> 20:48.400
than he was to either
of the two sons he did.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.032
Soleil called him after
she discovered the theft.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.399
He came to see me yesterday.

20:51.450 --> 20:55.272
That could not have gone well.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.289
He insisted Sabine Raoult died
because of him.

20:58.320 --> 21:01.357
He took full responsibility.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.529
Sounds like that bothered you.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.298
We never talked
about my mother, did we?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.366
No, I mean, I know
she died a long time ago.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.436
But other than that, I...

21:13.470 --> 21:15.438
So, anything about me

21:15.470 --> 21:17.461
that you might find
interesting or amusing

21:17.510 --> 21:19.501
or good,

21:19.540 --> 21:21.508
you'd have found
a more pure distillation

21:21.540 --> 21:23.849
of that in May Holmes.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.543
Naturally, my father divorced
her when I was eight years old.

21:27.580 --> 21:29.343
I knew that trouble was brewing

21:29.380 --> 21:30.938
when Mycroft and I were
packed off to boarding school

21:30.990 --> 21:33.083
a year ahead of schedule--
two in my case.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.815
By the time we came home
for the holidays,

21:34.860 --> 21:36.509
my mother was out on her ear.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.528
Your father threw her out?

21:38.560 --> 21:40.790
Prior to marriage, she signed
a prenuptial agreement.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.491
My father was guaranteed
full custody.

21:42.530 --> 21:43.929
She was guaranteed visitation,

21:43.970 --> 21:46.530
a small amount
for liVing expenses.

21:46.570 --> 21:49.835
She lived her last few months in
a modest flat in the East End.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.838
So modest in fact that
it went up like a tinder box

21:51.870 --> 21:54.031
when the neighbor's
water heater caught fire.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.638
Yeah, pretty sure the smoke

21:55.680 --> 21:57.079
would've got her
before the, uh...

21:59.850 --> 22:03.411
So I didn't speak to my father
for two years after that.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.788
You held him responsible.

22:07.820 --> 22:09.788
I did.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.526
You still do.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.468
I'm sorry.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.730
Just give me one second.

22:21.770 --> 22:23.567
Of course.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.634
I can work downstairs.

22:24.670 --> 22:26.604
Oh, no, I don't mean, um...

22:26.640 --> 22:27.800
Here.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.603
Have a look at this.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.107
The fourth entry
on the morning Bai was visited.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.345
Take a look.

22:36.950 --> 22:39.589
What am I looking at? It looks
like a bunch of scribbles.

22:39.620 --> 22:40.985
Just because it_
doesn't say anything,

22:41.020 --> 22:42.612
_ it doesn't mean _
it doesn't tell us anything.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.651
An elite graphologist
can use a mere doodle

22:44.690 --> 22:47.079
as the basis for a sample
in some instances,

22:47.130 --> 22:48.791
so be an elite graphologist.

22:48.830 --> 22:50.764
Okay.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.064
If this is the killer,

22:53.100 --> 22:54.636
I would say

22:54.670 --> 22:55.659
he was left-handed.

22:55.700 --> 22:56.894
Writes with a slanted baseline.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.498
Yes.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.167
Note the loops.

23:00.210 --> 23:02.599
They might be arrhythmic.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.902
They are.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.009
Just like the ones you see here.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.648
Sven Eklund.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.808
The Good Samaritan
who called in the mugging.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.614
The short white man
who committed the mugging.

23:17.190 --> 23:20.489
Wrote down his contact details
for the police.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.561
He's a mortician.
Hmm.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.919
Who does frequent business

23:26.970 --> 23:29.097
with Willowbrook
Assisted Living.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.904
Their Family Resources page
calls his work

23:31.940 --> 23:34.534
"incredibly lifelike."

23:34.580 --> 23:37.037
Thanks to his skill
with mortician's putty,

23:37.080 --> 23:39.571
no doubt.

23:39.610 --> 23:41.043
MAN (over radio):
Team leader, this is Unit Four.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.843
Neighbors haven't
seen our guy either.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.689
You got any word from the cars
that rolled on his business?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.585
Place was empty.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.713
Listen, I want an ND car posted
at the end of this block.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.923
This guy split, but...

23:51.960 --> 23:53.029
you never know.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.596
Maybe he'll come to his senses.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.791
Copy that.

23:56.830 --> 23:59.799
What do you got?

23:59.830 --> 24:02.037
The guy's missing

24:02.070 --> 24:04.163
four double-aught shells.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.134
It's the same kind
used at the arcade.

24:07.170 --> 24:10.037
I take it this is
where he made the mask.

24:10.080 --> 24:12.503
Masks, plural.

24:12.550 --> 24:14.745
You need to see this.

24:15.920 --> 24:19.139
Now, I recognize Bai and Meng.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.818
No idea on the other guy.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.487
Me neither.

24:23.530 --> 24:25.680
So, he could look like
any of these people.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.129
Seems to be the idea.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.752
There's paint on this table

24:28.800 --> 24:30.222
in a few different
flesh tones.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.728
Pretty sure he made
masks of all of them.

24:32.770 --> 24:35.637
What the hell is this guy up to?

24:35.670 --> 24:36.989
No clue.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.701
But he may not be
finished killing people.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.119
WATSON:
You slept.

24:50.150 --> 24:51.185
Yes, I'm human.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.847
It is required periodically.

24:52.890 --> 24:53.982
Your phone woke me up.

24:54.020 --> 24:55.817
It was Marcus.

24:55.860 --> 24:58.021
Sven Eklund's wife
got a text from a burner phone.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.527
"So sorry.
Leaving tomorrow.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.027
I will call you when I'm safe."

25:01.060 --> 25:02.721
So, a manhunt's underway

25:02.760 --> 25:03.795
and he's gonna spend

25:03.830 --> 25:04.990
a day in the city
before he flees?

25:05.030 --> 25:06.793
Could be he's scrambling for a
way to get out of the country.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.661
Or he hasn't finished
what he's doing.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.531
Did his wife
happen to know

25:10.570 --> 25:11.969
why he rained hell down
on three Triad members?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.739
No.

25:13.780 --> 25:14.804
But apparently he got

25:14.840 --> 25:16.728
a terminal diagnosis recently.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.975
Cardiomyopathy.

25:20.250 --> 25:21.672
His heart's gonna be too big

25:21.720 --> 25:22.778
to continue beating
within a year.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.685
She thinks he snapped.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.881
A mortician who can't come to
terms With his own mortality?

25:26.920 --> 25:28.854
Eh.

25:28.890 --> 25:29.811
Bai's mask was used

25:29.860 --> 25:31.589
to get close to and execute

25:31.630 --> 25:32.927
three gang members.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.996
And then discarded.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.793
A Meng mask would
suggest a fixation

25:36.830 --> 25:38.127
with the Snake Eye Boys.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.319
Perhaps he intends to use it

25:39.370 --> 25:41.065
to commit more murders.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.965
(knocking on table)

25:43.000 --> 25:44.934
This man doesn't look like
he's a member of any Triad.

25:44.970 --> 25:47.234
No, but maybe Sven
used a mask

25:47.270 --> 25:50.842
to get into Willowbrook
to talk to Bai-May Lung.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.802
I suppose if you are half-blind,

25:52.850 --> 25:55.114
this man might appear Caucasian.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.345
The captain's got Meng Zhou
coming into the station.

25:57.380 --> 25:58.916
We're gonna warn him
that he might be in danger.

25:58.950 --> 26:00.349
Maybe you could
go to Willowbrook,

26:00.390 --> 26:02.017
see if I'm right
about that guy.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.088
No.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.358
You're quite sure
that's not the man

26:06.390 --> 26:07.994
who took your clothes?

26:08.030 --> 26:09.793
Are you going blind, too?

26:09.830 --> 26:11.889
This man is not white.

26:11.930 --> 26:13.966
What about this man?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.764
Maybe.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.301
Maybe his cousin.

26:18.340 --> 26:21.173
The man who took my picture.

26:21.210 --> 26:22.632
He had a big nose.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.307
So him, except for the nose?

26:24.350 --> 26:25.806
That's what I said.

26:27.310 --> 26:31.189
We have no idea _
what this man is planning,

26:31.220 --> 26:34.109
but we can figure it out
and stop him

26:34.160 --> 26:35.809
if you work with us.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.851
Three of your men

26:37.890 --> 26:38.822
have already died.

26:38.860 --> 26:40.623
For all we know,
more attacks could be coming.

26:40.660 --> 26:42.059
You really don't
want to tell us

26:42.100 --> 26:45.297
how Mr. Eklund is connected
to the Snake Eye Boys?

26:45.330 --> 26:48.868
Never have I seen
this man before.

26:50.940 --> 26:52.999
But this man.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.337
This is Terry Perez.

26:56.410 --> 26:59.345
And who's that?

26:59.380 --> 27:02.076
He fixes machines
at the arcade for many years.

27:02.120 --> 27:06.716
_ But last week
he did something very unusual.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.981
Ray Mui, my friend--

27:10.020 --> 27:12.420
one of the men who died.

27:12.460 --> 27:15.349
He said that Terry came over
very late one night.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.665
He-he looked strange.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.997
His face.

27:20.030 --> 27:22.760
Uh, they thought
maybe he on drugs.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.802
He said nothing.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.308
He just wave at
them to open up.

27:27.340 --> 27:29.399
(chuckles)

27:29.440 --> 27:31.670
But it was 1:00 am.
in the morning, huh?

27:31.710 --> 27:33.109
So my friend said, "No, no.

27:33.150 --> 27:35.118
You come back tomorrow."

27:35.150 --> 27:38.017
So Terry leaves.

27:38.050 --> 27:40.439
Next day they call him
and-and he said,

27:40.490 --> 27:43.084
"You mistaken.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.452
I was not there last night."

27:45.490 --> 27:47.321
Must've been Sven.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.157
When his Terry mask
didn't work,

27:49.200 --> 27:50.428
he made one
that looked like Bai.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.759
I told you everything I know.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.258
Now, you find this man.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.133
If Sven really did have to take
two passes at that arcade,

28:00.170 --> 28:02.934
I guess your partner is right.

28:02.980 --> 28:05.198
There's no such thing
as a master of disguise.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.117
At least we now know
what those two masks were for.

28:08.150 --> 28:09.378
(phone chimes)

28:09.420 --> 28:11.240
That just leaves us the one
that looks like Meng.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.882
What's up?

28:12.920 --> 28:14.410
Sherlock says that Sven

28:14.460 --> 28:16.257
did not wear a mask
when he went to see Bai.

28:16.290 --> 28:18.850
Just made his nose
a little bigger.

28:18.890 --> 28:21.256
But just in case
Sven is going for

28:21.300 --> 28:22.790
the "less is more" approach
again,

28:22.830 --> 28:24.366
Sherlock mocked up
a few alternate looks

28:24.400 --> 28:26.925
for the Finest Message
you issued.

28:26.970 --> 28:30.963
Okay, I'll get these
out to our people.

28:32.810 --> 28:33.936
(beeps)

28:33.980 --> 28:35.436
WOMAN:
Sir, your son is here.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.449
He's not on the schedule.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.448
Send him in.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.471
Yes, sir.

28:50.860 --> 28:52.828
Sabine's things.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.226
You can return them to your
beloved step-acquaintance

28:55.260 --> 28:56.329
with my apologies.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.965
So, you've cleared Sabine?

28:59.000 --> 29:00.319
There's ample evidence
in her letters

29:00.370 --> 29:02.065
that her affection
for you is genume.

29:02.100 --> 29:04.830
But there's nothing dispositive
one way or the other.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.134
Only because you can't
prove a negative.

29:07.170 --> 29:09.172
I could come much closer
ifI could have access

29:09.210 --> 29:11.246
to her professional
e-mail accounts.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.077
I know _she ran
your Paris office.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.840
A review of her business _
correspondence should settle it.

29:19.050 --> 29:21.257
And when you've finished,

29:21.290 --> 29:22.985
come back and apologize.

29:23.020 --> 29:24.521
That will be a cold day, indeed.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.778
It's uncanny.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.821
When I look at you,
I see your mother.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.862
I hear her voice.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.398
I am my mother's son.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.238
You have more in common
than you realize.

29:40.610 --> 29:43.329
What's that?

29:43.380 --> 29:45.371
Something I dug
up last night

29:45.410 --> 29:48.072
after our little talk.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.918
Records of her stay
at the Lawford Center.

29:53.220 --> 29:57.054
Did you really believe you're
the first addict in the family?

30:01.500 --> 30:04.196
She had a problem.

30:04.230 --> 30:06.892
I didn't understand it.

30:06.930 --> 30:10.593
I only knew that
I loved her and...

30:10.640 --> 30:12.403
and so I forced her to get help

30:12.440 --> 30:14.431
as a precondition
of our marriage.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.107
It worked.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.869
We started our family.

30:17.910 --> 30:19.377
Mycroft came along.

30:19.410 --> 30:20.570
And then you.

30:22.450 --> 30:25.487
When her sobriety
was finally punctured,

30:25.520 --> 30:29.286
I sent the two of you
away to boarding school.

30:31.590 --> 30:35.299
I urged her to return
to Lawford, she refused.

30:35.330 --> 30:37.924
She thought she could
get well herself.

30:37.970 --> 30:41.531
I told her it was a mistake.

30:41.570 --> 30:45.859
Never have I been
so unhappy to be correct.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.136
She begged me not to tell you.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.171
And for decades, I obliged.

30:52.210 --> 30:54.212
But no longer.

30:55.950 --> 30:58.646
I wish I could say
that I cut her off

30:58.690 --> 31:02.080
to help her, but I can't.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.556
Enforcing
our prenuptial agreement

31:05.590 --> 31:08.593
was the pettiest thing
I've ever done in my life.

31:08.630 --> 31:10.996
I made the decision
out of anger.

31:11.030 --> 31:13.521
And I shall
never forgive myself.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.562
But enough is enough.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.534
Well, you don't get
to decide that.

31:18.570 --> 31:20.606
I do, Sherlock.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.404
I have.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.577
Now get out.

31:29.580 --> 31:32.378
(door opens)

31:32.420 --> 31:34.217
(beep)
Sherlock, I don't know

31:34.260 --> 31:35.909
why you're not returning
my texts,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.188
but Sven Eklund
is still out there,

31:37.220 --> 31:38.528
and we could use your help.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.050
So call me back.

31:40.090 --> 31:42.092
If that was Sherlock,
you can tell him to relax.

31:42.130 --> 31:43.256
We got Sven.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.562
TSA and Port Authority Police

31:44.600 --> 31:47.125
popped him at JFK
with a fake ID.

31:47.170 --> 31:49.559
He had a putty nose
and a brown wig on.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.568
Dead ringer for one of
the alternate looks we put up.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.100
They're bringing him
in right now.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.402
SVEN:
Yeah, that's right.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.203
The last one,
he-he started to run

31:56.240 --> 31:57.434
to the back of the arcade,

31:57.480 --> 31:59.209
so I... you know,
I ran after him.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.048
And he slipped and
I shot him in the chest.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.116
Then I left.

32:04.150 --> 32:07.017
All right, just so we've
got the rest of it clear:

32:07.050 --> 32:08.608
You were almost to your car

32:08.660 --> 32:10.150
and then Kevin Chang,
he came up to you

32:10.190 --> 32:11.555
and demanded
your wallet?

32:11.590 --> 32:13.387
Well, no, my purse, actually,

32:13.430 --> 32:15.398
because, you know,
I was an old woman. (laughs)

32:17.500 --> 32:20.367
I-I did feel a little bad
about how much I hit that guy,

32:20.400 --> 32:22.197
but there was_
so much adrenaline.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.662
You seem awfully pleased
with yourself.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.304
I'd like to know why.

32:25.340 --> 32:27.035
What was all this about?

32:27.070 --> 32:28.674
Wh...

32:28.710 --> 32:31.679
There's three fewer
bad guys in the world.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.302
I'm sure you appreciate that.

32:33.350 --> 32:34.669
WATSON:
What were you gonna do

32:34.720 --> 32:36.369
with the other disguise
that looked like Meng Zhou?

32:36.420 --> 32:37.717
What were you gonna use it for?

32:37.750 --> 32:39.513
To get into
the arcade.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.313
But then, you know, I realized

32:41.360 --> 32:42.611
that those guys
saw him every day.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.628
The mask wouldn't fool them,

32:44.660 --> 32:46.252
so I made others.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.689
BELL:
I don't believe you.

32:47.730 --> 32:49.721
Come on, Sven,
don't get shy now.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.159
I want to know
why you didn't run

32:51.200 --> 32:53.168
the second you found out
we were looking for you.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.690
You waited a day.

32:54.740 --> 32:58.062
You sure you didn't stick around
to use that other mask?

32:58.110 --> 33:00.260
We gonna find any more bodies
with your name on 'em?

33:00.310 --> 33:01.777
No, no, you've got
the wrong idea.

33:01.810 --> 33:02.276
GREGSON:
Then help us to understand.

33:02.310 --> 33:05.040
Why did you do this?

33:05.080 --> 33:07.640
Does it have something to do
with that scar on your arm?

33:07.680 --> 33:10.342
Looks pretty fresh.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.109
Maybe a few weeks old.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.717
I hurt myself at work.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.716
We use surgical scissors

33:17.760 --> 33:19.352
when we do embalming.

33:19.390 --> 33:21.096
I-I-I left some out,
I just turned right into them.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.392
WATSON:
Looks more like
a knife wound to me.

33:22.430 --> 33:23.795
You know, one of the men
at the arcade

33:23.830 --> 33:25.229
who was killed, Ray Mui,

33:25.270 --> 33:27.226
he had a switchblade
on him when he died.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.669
It would've left
a mark like that.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.099
He did that to you,

33:30.140 --> 33:31.437
didn't he?

33:31.470 --> 33:33.062
So did you finish

33:33.110 --> 33:34.532
getting your revenge
at the arcade,

33:34.580 --> 33:36.002
or was there more?

33:37.110 --> 33:39.044
Uh...

33:39.080 --> 33:40.342
I-I_ don't have
anything else to say.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.371
GREGSON: _
You got a year to live

33:42.420 --> 33:44.741
and you were proud
to sit there and tell us

33:44.790 --> 33:48.248
every detail about
how you killed three guys.

33:48.290 --> 33:51.054
So the only reason
I can imagine

33:51.090 --> 33:52.626
you're not telling us why

33:52.660 --> 33:55.049
is because there's
something you did.

33:55.100 --> 33:58.263
Something you don't
want us to know about.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.161
Get me a lavwer

34:04.210 --> 34:05.802
or take me to jail.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.637
I'm done talking.

34:15.450 --> 34:17.748
GREGSON:
I hope that second bag of
chips is a little reward.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.418
You did good work today.

34:19.450 --> 34:21.281
I'm giving myself an "I"
for "Incomplete."

34:21.320 --> 34:22.753
I hear you.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.327
I'm pretty sure when Sven Eklund
goes to meet his maker,

34:25.360 --> 34:27.225
he's gonna have to answer for
more than those three murders.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.558
But...

34:29.600 --> 34:31.659
tomorrow's another day.
Before you go...

34:31.700 --> 34:32.860
I was right.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.731
Sven was stabbed
on the 23rd of last month.

34:34.770 --> 34:37.568
He was treated in the ER
at Hamilton Hospital.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.238
The doctors there weren't buying
his scalpel story, either.

34:39.270 --> 34:41.636
The blade that cut him
was double-edged.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.830
So they filled out
a police report.

34:46.780 --> 34:49.271
That definitely
could've been made

34:49.320 --> 34:51.845
by a switchblade like Ray Mui's.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.448
We would've caught it sooner,

34:53.490 --> 34:55.412
but Sven wasn't gonna talk
or press charges,

34:55.460 --> 34:58.088
so the report got lost
on the bottom of the pile.

34:59.630 --> 35:00.824
How did you think to go
to the 14th Precinct?

35:00.860 --> 35:02.327
They cover Hamilton

35:02.360 --> 35:03.850
and it's the closest place
to the mortuary.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.765
You think Snake Eye Boys

35:05.800 --> 35:06.869
attacked him at his work?

35:06.900 --> 35:09.539
Look at the intake time.

35:09.570 --> 35:10.832
11:30 am.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.430
We've got Sven's
work calendar.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.732
He was doing an embalming

35:14.780 --> 35:16.407
in the morning

35:16.440 --> 35:17.839
and he was supposed to handle
a viewing at noon.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.269
Why would a Triad
charge into a mortuary,

35:20.310 --> 35:22.244
stab somebody their boss
doesn't even know?

35:22.280 --> 35:25.317
That's what I'd like to know.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.519
He lives.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.289
Yeah. Sorry I've been
out of touch.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.719
Had a few things to chew on.

35:31.760 --> 35:33.182
Family matters.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.448
You okay?
Yeah.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.229
I'll be better with some work
to focus on.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.921
So I understand from your...

35:38.970 --> 35:41.939
many messages that Sven Eklund
has not confessed

35:41.970 --> 35:43.892
to anyone's satisfaction
and that you believe

35:43.940 --> 35:46.909
he was once knifed by various
and sundry Snake Eye Boys.

35:46.940 --> 35:48.771
But he won't admit it,
which makes no sense.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.607
Couldn't confess fast enough

35:50.640 --> 35:52.176
until we asked him
about his motive.

35:52.210 --> 35:53.643
Revenge was not enough?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.477
Well, there's no question
he got revenge,

35:55.520 --> 35:56.839
so why not crow about it?

35:56.880 --> 35:58.586
He didn't seem_
to want to explain

35:58.620 --> 36:00.417
why a Triad would
go into his business

36:00.450 --> 36:01.712
and attack him
in the first place.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.909
That's interesting.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.450
Mmm.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.924
So is this.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.452
So the body that Sven was
working on that morning...

36:10.500 --> 36:11.728
Brent Arrieta.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.965
He had been a resident
at Willowbrook.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.889
I imagine many of Sven's clients
come from that grim warehouse.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.931
Yes, but it's strange.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.858
The embalming process takes
a couple of hours, right?

36:20.910 --> 36:22.878
According to these
phone records,

36:22.910 --> 36:25.674
Sven took a break in the middle
of working on Arrieta

36:25.710 --> 36:27.507
to call Michael Haas, the
administrator at Willowbrook.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.313
Two hours later,
Sven is in the ER.

36:29.350 --> 36:31.818
There's something there,
I just can't place it.

36:31.850 --> 36:32.987
Course you can't.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.317
'Cause you weren't with me

36:34.360 --> 36:35.554
a_t Willowbrook
earlier this morning.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.956
The Chinatown Community
Outreach posters

36:37.990 --> 36:39.719
which so offended you
have been removed,

36:39.760 --> 36:42.752
presumably at the request
of Mr. Haas.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.361
But we'll have to exhume Mr.
Arrieta's body to know for sure.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.664
(coughing)

36:49.700 --> 36:50.894
Okay.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.009
N-Now you really
have to tell me.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.735
Why am I here?

36:53.770 --> 36:55.909
Why-why are you making
me look at Mr. Arrieta?

36:55.940 --> 36:57.771
Because...

36:57.810 --> 36:59.346
we had to.

36:59.380 --> 37:00.779
And we thought
it might help put you

37:00.810 --> 37:01.742
in the proper
frame of mind.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.543
I know it's dreadful,

37:03.580 --> 37:05.241
but the stench
would be much worse

37:05.290 --> 37:06.643
if Sven Eklund
hadn't embalmed the body.

37:06.690 --> 37:07.987
What we wanted
to talk to you about

37:08.020 --> 37:09.510
was why he stopped

37:09.560 --> 37:10.959
midway through that process
to call you

37:10.990 --> 37:12.787
and why,
just two hours later,

37:12.830 --> 37:14.297
he's getting his arm stitched up

37:14.330 --> 37:15.524
at Hamilton Hospital.

37:15.560 --> 37:16.788
And why, the very next day,

37:16.830 --> 37:18.627
he started
photographing faces

37:18.670 --> 37:20.490
that would help him shoot up
a Chinese Triad.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.259
Figuring out how

37:22.300 --> 37:24.768
those three things connected
cost us a lot of sleep.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.539
You see, we now know why
Sven was calling you.

37:26.570 --> 37:30.006
Mr. Arrieta here is still
chock-full of muscle relaxant.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.008
We know it was
the cause of death.
He died in his sleep.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.610
No, he died of a massive
Carisoprodol overdose.

37:34.650 --> 37:35.947
Probably administered
in his food.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.948
Made it impossible
for him to breathe.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.948
Suffocated in his armchair.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.481
Sven would've realized that
when he went to insert

37:42.520 --> 37:44.329
these eyelid caps.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.850
Morticians use them

37:45.890 --> 37:47.528
so the eyes don't open
during the viewing.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.357
He would've seen Mr_. Arrieta's
enlarged pupils.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.288
You see, that is one of
the classic signs

37:51.330 --> 37:53.025
of a muscle relaxant overdose.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.538
Don't pretend this is the first
time you've heard this.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.868
Sven called you
to tell you what he'd found.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.960
Little did he know you were the
one who poisoned Mr. Arrieta.

38:01.010 --> 38:02.375
MICHAEL:
No!

38:02.410 --> 38:03.877
Why would I? That's crazy.

38:03.910 --> 38:04.979
Your first move

38:05.010 --> 38:06.773
was to call the Snake Eye Boys.

38:06.810 --> 38:09.449
They went and "explained"
to Mr. Eklund--

38:09.480 --> 38:11.983
with the help
of Ray Mui's switchblade--

38:12.020 --> 38:14.318
that he needed to keep
his mouth shut, which he did.

38:14.360 --> 38:15.657
Oh, oh, so now I'm not
just the killer.

38:15.690 --> 38:18.011
Now I can sic Chinese gangsters
on people?

38:18.060 --> 38:19.459
WATSON:
Sure, you could.

38:19.490 --> 38:20.821
You were their golden goose.

38:20.860 --> 38:22.088
You gave yourself away

38:22.130 --> 38:24.098
when you took
the posters down.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.064
Chinatown Community Outreach.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.489
We pulled the 501(c) paperwork.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.962
That outfit was wholly owned

38:30.000 --> 38:32.059
by the three men
that Sven shot Monday night.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.031
About the only thing

38:33.070 --> 38:34.469
we can't figure out

38:34.510 --> 38:36.102
is why you were scamming
for those guys.

38:36.140 --> 38:38.608
You get a cut, or did they
have something on you?

38:38.650 --> 38:39.969
What guys? I don't even know

38:40.010 --> 38:41.102
who you are talking about now.

38:41.150 --> 38:42.572
BELL;
Ray MUI.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.781
Gao Chung Pei. Adam Tsai.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.345
They had you pressuring
the residents at Willowbrook

38:47.390 --> 38:48.789
to donate to their fake charity.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.617
You don't think
there's a paper trail?

38:50.660 --> 38:54.084
I don't control who gives what
to what charity.

38:54.130 --> 38:56.496
No. You're just
a voice in their ear.

38:56.530 --> 38:58.691
And anyone who makes
the mistake of listening

38:58.730 --> 39:01.096
and revising their estate
gets a complimentary trip

39:01.130 --> 39:02.597
to Sven Eklund's slab.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.096
We're done here.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.767
BELL:
I don't think we are.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.038
'Cause I'm pretty sure
that when we look at

39:07.070 --> 39:08.708
all the recent deaths
at Willowbrook,

39:08.740 --> 39:10.002
we're gonna find a pattern

39:10.040 --> 39:11.678
of charitable giving
and dirt naps.

39:11.710 --> 39:14.099
Can we please go outside? I...

39:14.150 --> 39:15.549
I can't breathe in here.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.071
(coughing)

39:18.120 --> 39:20.088
I...

39:20.120 --> 39:21.951
I want immunity.

39:21.990 --> 39:23.548
I can testify.

39:23.590 --> 39:24.852
Against who?

39:24.890 --> 39:27.051
Those guys.
They have a boss.

39:27.090 --> 39:28.899
Yes, of course. Meng Zhou.

39:28.930 --> 39:30.022
Came to see you last night,
didn't he?

39:30.060 --> 39:31.618
How...

39:31.670 --> 39:33.422
how did you know that?

39:33.470 --> 39:35.392
Meng Zhou was in our police
station earlier this morning.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.396
He was pretty ticked
to find out about the scam

39:37.440 --> 39:39.601
his dead buddies had been
running at Willowbrook.

39:39.640 --> 39:41.107
Guess they never told him.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.539
No.

39:42.580 --> 39:43.877
They did.

39:43.910 --> 39:45.946
He knew.
WATSON:
How do you know?

39:45.980 --> 39:47.743
Did he say so when
he came to see you?

39:47.780 --> 39:49.873
He didn't say anything,

39:49.920 --> 39:52.445
he just... handed me a note.

39:52.490 --> 39:54.583
BELL:
Something to
the effect of,

39:54.620 --> 39:56.713
"Nothing stops"?
Maybe a numbered account

39:56.760 --> 39:57.954
that was supposed
to replace the charity?

39:57.990 --> 39:59.878
WATSON:
If you had just asked

39:59.930 --> 40:01.124
Meng Zhou a question,
just one,

40:01.160 --> 40:02.559
you would've heard his voice

40:02.600 --> 40:04.056
and realized
it was Sven Eklund.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.624
Sven has cardiomyopathy.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.796
He's dying.

40:06.830 --> 40:09.060
He got stabbed
and he got angry.

40:09.100 --> 40:11.136
And he wanted to provide
for his family.

40:11.170 --> 40:13.104
What's your excuse
for killing people?

40:18.140 --> 40:20.608
Found something
in Sabine's e-mails.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.811
A message which sealed her fate.

40:23.850 --> 40:25.488
And nearly yours.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.148
One _of her old friends from
univerSIty was in town.

40:28.190 --> 40:30.158
Wanted to meet for a late drink.

40:30.190 --> 40:33.227
Sabine told her where the two of
you would be dining that night.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.125
There was no spur-
of-the-moment choice.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.821
She'd already decided.

40:36.860 --> 40:38.122
She always did have a way

40:38.160 --> 40:39.798
of getting
what she wanted from me.

40:39.830 --> 40:41.934
It doesn't prove
she was complicit.

40:41.970 --> 40:43.460
No. In fact, she wasn't.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.865
Unbeknownst to her,

40:44.910 --> 40:47.435
her e-mails were being read
by a mercenary.

40:48.710 --> 40:51.178
I had a friend take a look
at her account.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.474
He discovered a worm

40:53.510 --> 40:55.171
which was blind-copying her mail

40:55.220 --> 40:56.642
and sending it
to a separate account

40:56.680 --> 40:58.170
belonging to a man named
Ruslan Krasnov.

40:58.220 --> 41:01.041
Who is he?

41:01.090 --> 41:04.184
A killer of Chechen extraction.

41:04.220 --> 41:07.087
Obviously, Ruslan is just
a trigger man.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.927
He's not the architect of
the assassmation attempt.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.622
Should be easy enough
to find his employer.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.069
It would be,

41:13.100 --> 41:14.169
if he wasn't already serving

41:14.200 --> 41:15.736
_ a life sentence
in a supermax prison

41:15.770 --> 41:17.635
just outside
St. Petersburg in Russia.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.638
So if you want answers
from the horse's mouth...

41:19.670 --> 41:22.639
I'll find a way.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.238
Did you
give me this

41:24.280 --> 41:26.248
just to be horrible?

41:26.280 --> 41:29.113
Or... did you think
it would change anything?

41:30.320 --> 41:31.810
It is helpful.
I'll give you that.

41:31.850 --> 41:33.647
It gives me
incrementally more insight

41:33.690 --> 41:36.659
into my own problem.

41:36.690 --> 41:39.284
She's no less dead.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.286
I'm no less an addict.

41:41.330 --> 41:43.821
And you're no more a father.

41:46.330 --> 41:48.298
I know what it's like.

41:48.330 --> 41:50.139
To lose a great love.

41:51.610 --> 41:52.634
It can change you,

41:52.670 --> 41:54.979
force you to make bad decisions.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.274
I've told you.

41:57.310 --> 42:01.269
IfI could take back
the last 33 years...

42:01.310 --> 42:03.517
I'm not talking about Mother.

42:07.350 --> 42:10.319
These are dangerous times
for you.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.988
So I'd tread carefully.
