00:12.010 --> 00:13.339
A ghost planet?

00:13.512 --> 00:16.133
I suggest no supernatural explanation,
captain.

00:16.306 --> 00:17.884
I merely point out that the facts

00:18.058 --> 00:20.265
do not fit any known categories
of planets.

00:20.436 --> 00:22.891
Let's take the facts one by one.
They should explain something.

00:23.063 --> 00:24.142
Undoubtedly.

00:24.314 --> 00:27.517
The age of this planet would seem
to be only a few thousand years.

00:27.693 --> 00:31.560
It would be impossible for vegetation
to evolve in so short a period.

00:32.322 --> 00:34.861
Its size is approximately
that of Earth's moon.

00:35.034 --> 00:38.652
But its mass and its atmosphere
are similar to Earth.

00:39.288 --> 00:40.663
That would be difficult to explain.

00:41.498 --> 00:43.325
It would be impossible, captain.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.501
An atmosphere could not evolve
in so short a period of time.

00:46.670 --> 00:48.829
- And yet it has.
- Evidently.

00:49.006 --> 00:51.378
But the inconsistencies
are so compounded

00:51.550 --> 00:54.504
as to present
a seemingly impossible phenomenon.

00:54.678 --> 00:58.177
- But a fascinating one, Mr. Spock.
- Precisely, captain.

00:58.348 --> 01:00.424
It would bear closer investigation,
it would seem,

01:00.600 --> 01:02.724
if we are to provide Starfleet
with an accurate report.

01:02.895 --> 01:04.269
Lieutenant, send Dr. McCoy

01:04.438 --> 01:06.098
to the Transporter Room
for survey party.

01:06.273 --> 01:08.764
- We'll also need geologist D'Amato.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.769
Beam down coordinates
for the Transporter Room.

01:10.944 --> 01:13.270
Mr. Sulu, you'll accompany me.

01:13.447 --> 01:16.021
Mr. Spock, you have the conn.

01:18.911 --> 01:22.529
Lieutenant Rahda,
report to the Bridge immediately.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.628
This expedition should be
a geologist's dream, Mr. D'Amato.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.918
Well, the opportunity
to explore so young a planet

01:30.089 --> 01:31.583
is an incredible bit of luck, captain.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.501
If Mr. Spock is correct,
you'll have a report

01:33.676 --> 01:36.131
to startle the Fifth Interstellar
Geophysical Conference.

01:36.303 --> 01:40.087
- Why? What is it, Jim?
- A planet even Spock can't explain.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.389
Prepare to transport.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.806
Energize.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.443
Wait. You must not go.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.666
- Jim, did you see what I saw?
- That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.

02:17.845 --> 02:19.921
- Kirk to...
- Captain. Captain.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.156
Mr. Spock, are you all right?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.487
Yes. I believe no permanent damage
was done.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.695
What happened?

02:45.874 --> 02:47.866
The occipital area of my head

02:48.042 --> 02:50.616
seems to have impacted
with the arm of the chair.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.287
No, Mr. Spock, I meant,
what happened to us?

02:53.465 --> 02:54.959
That we have yet to ascertain.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.541
Mr. Spock. The planet's gone.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.632
What kind of earthquakes
do they have in this place?

03:02.808 --> 03:05.928
I don't know. Any more like that,
they'll tear the planet apart.

03:06.103 --> 03:10.978
Captain, this tremor we felt,
if that's what it was...

03:11.149 --> 03:14.732
And it's like no seismic disturbance
I've felt before.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.774
- I got a reading
of almost immeasurable power,

03:17.948 --> 03:20.024
but it's not there anymore.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.822
Could seismic stress
have accounted for it?

03:23.161 --> 03:27.657
The reading I got had nothing
to do with a seismic force.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.668
That's very strange.
And that woman.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.371
Kirk to Enterprise.
Kirk to Enterprise. Come in.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.343
- Shock may have damaged it.
- It's gone.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.761
The Enterprise. It's gone.

03:43.933 --> 03:46.388
He's right. There's nothing there.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.016
How could it just be gone?
What the devil does that mean, Jim?

03:49.188 --> 03:50.812
For one thing,

03:51.648 --> 03:53.688
it means we're stranded.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.451
Space, the final frontier.

04:17.007 --> 04:21.171
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

04:21.345 --> 04:25.343
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

04:25.516 --> 04:29.348
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

04:29.520 --> 04:33.019
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.849
The Enterprise must have blown up.

05:17.027 --> 05:20.277
That would explain the high-radiation
readings, wouldn't it, if the matter..?

05:20.447 --> 05:23.364
Shouldn't we stop guessing, Mr. Sulu,
and try and establish a pattern?

05:23.533 --> 05:26.106
I get no readings
of high-energy concentration.

05:26.286 --> 05:27.780
If the Enterprise had blown up,

05:27.954 --> 05:30.030
it would have left
a high residual radiation.

05:30.206 --> 05:33.576
Could it be the Enterprise hit us?
Hit the planet?

05:33.752 --> 05:36.124
Once in Siberia
there was a meteor so great

05:36.296 --> 05:38.372
that it flattened whole forests
and was felt as far...

05:38.548 --> 05:40.457
Mr. Sulu, if I'd wanted
a Russian history lesson,

05:40.633 --> 05:42.626
I'd have brought along Mr. Chekov.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.550
This is a matter of survival,
gentlemen.

05:45.722 --> 05:49.850
Without the Enterprise,
we need food, and we need water,

05:50.018 --> 05:51.049
and we need them fast.

05:51.228 --> 05:52.971
I want a detailed analysis made
of this planet

05:53.146 --> 05:54.640
and I want it now.

05:54.814 --> 05:56.356
- Aye, sir.
- Yes, sir.

05:57.943 --> 05:59.568
Mr. Sulu.

06:04.157 --> 06:06.529
Engineering, no damage.
All power levels normal.

06:06.701 --> 06:09.275
Damage-control report:
Ship functioning normally.

06:09.454 --> 06:11.578
Many bumps and bruises.

06:11.749 --> 06:16.292
One casualty, Mr. Spock.
The transporter officer. He's dead.

06:16.462 --> 06:17.790
Dead?

06:18.922 --> 06:21.460
- Spock to Sickbay.
- Sickbay. Dr. M'Benga.

06:21.633 --> 06:23.672
Report on the death
of the transporter officer.

06:23.843 --> 06:25.303
We're not sure.

06:25.471 --> 06:27.760
Dr. Sanchez is conducting
an autopsy right now.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.718
Give me a full report as soon
as possible, please. Spock out.

06:34.229 --> 06:35.854
Mr. Scott,

06:36.023 --> 06:38.431
have the transporter checked
for possible malfunction.

06:38.609 --> 06:39.640
Aye, sir.

06:39.819 --> 06:43.188
No debris of any kind, sir.
I've made two full scans.

06:43.364 --> 06:46.483
If the planet had broken up,
there would be some sign.

06:47.451 --> 06:49.858
What bothers me is the stars,
Mr. Spock.

06:50.037 --> 06:53.620
- The stars.
- Yes, sir. They're wrong.

06:53.791 --> 06:56.412
- Wrong?
- Yes, Mr. Spock.

06:56.585 --> 06:58.080
Look.

07:00.214 --> 07:04.342
Now, here's a replay of the star pattern
just before the explosion.

07:06.888 --> 07:09.011
A positional change.

07:09.182 --> 07:10.889
It doesn't make any sense.

07:11.058 --> 07:13.265
But somehow, I'd say,
that in a flash,

07:13.436 --> 07:16.187
we've been knocked 1,000 light years
away from where we were.

07:16.355 --> 07:20.353
990.7 light years to be exact,
lieutenant.

07:20.526 --> 07:23.313
That's not possible.
Nothing can do that.

07:23.488 --> 07:25.646
Mr. Scott, since we are here,

07:25.823 --> 07:30.319
your statement is not only illogical
but also unworthy of refutation.

07:30.494 --> 07:33.615
It is also illogical to assume
that any explosion,

07:33.790 --> 07:35.948
even that of a small star
going supernova,

07:36.125 --> 07:40.039
could have hurled us
a distance of 990.7 light years.

07:40.213 --> 07:43.048
The point is it shouldn't
have hurled us anywhere.

07:43.215 --> 07:46.051
It should have destroyed us
immediately, vaporised us.

07:46.219 --> 07:48.461
That is correct, Mr. Scott,
by all the laws that we know.

07:48.638 --> 07:50.263
There was no period
of unconsciousness.

07:50.431 --> 07:53.101
Our ship's chronometers registered
a matter of only a few seconds.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.937
Therefore we were displaced
through space

07:56.103 --> 07:58.725
in some manner
which I am unable to fathom.

07:58.899 --> 08:00.938
What you're saying
is that the planet didn't blow up.

08:01.109 --> 08:02.983
The captain and the others,
they're still alive.

08:03.153 --> 08:06.106
Please, Mr. Scott,
restrain your leaps of illogic.

08:06.281 --> 08:09.945
I have said nothing.
I was merely speculating.

08:10.785 --> 08:14.036
- Sickbay to Mr. Spock.
- Spock here.

08:14.206 --> 08:16.245
You asked for an autopsy report.

08:16.416 --> 08:17.447
It's only preliminary,

08:17.626 --> 08:20.792
but the cause of death
seems to have been cellular disruption.

08:21.296 --> 08:22.458
Explain.

08:22.630 --> 08:24.089
It's as though every cell in the body

08:24.257 --> 08:26.297
had been individually blasted
from inside.

08:26.468 --> 08:28.959
Would any known
disease organism do that?

08:29.137 --> 08:31.296
Dr. Sanchez has ruled
that possibility out, sir.

08:31.473 --> 08:34.342
Please keep me fully advised.
Spock out.

08:35.226 --> 08:37.385
He was in the Transporter Room.

08:37.562 --> 08:43.067
Someone may have entered
after Captain Kirk and his party left.

08:43.652 --> 08:46.688
Mr. Scott, since the Enterprise
is obviously functional,

08:46.863 --> 08:49.817
I suggest we return
to our starting place at top warp speed.

08:49.991 --> 08:53.657
Aye, sir. But even at that,
it will take us a while to get there.

08:53.829 --> 08:57.079
In that case, Mr. Scott,
I suggest we start at once.

08:57.249 --> 08:58.328
Can you give me warp 8?

08:58.500 --> 09:01.287
Aye, sir. And maybe a wee bit more.

09:01.461 --> 09:04.996
I'll sit on the warp engines myself
and nurse them.

09:05.173 --> 09:09.836
That position, Mr. Scott,
would not only be unavailing,

09:10.012 --> 09:13.262
but also undignified.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.553
Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course...

09:17.727 --> 09:19.222
Already plotted and laid in, sir.

09:20.356 --> 09:22.681
Good. Then prepare
to come to warp 8.

09:24.026 --> 09:27.276
- Your report covers all vegetation?
- Yes, captain.

09:27.446 --> 09:30.530
All vegetation is inedible.
Poison to us.

09:30.699 --> 09:32.276
If the Enterprise
has been destroyed,

09:32.451 --> 09:35.156
you know how long we can survive.

09:35.997 --> 09:37.656
Yes.

09:37.832 --> 09:38.863
I don't see any water,

09:39.041 --> 09:40.868
but there must be some
to grow the vegetation.

09:41.043 --> 09:43.664
A source of water
would stretch our survival.

09:43.837 --> 09:46.506
Did you see any evidence
of rainfall?

09:46.673 --> 09:49.758
No, sir. And I haven't seen any evidence
that there ever has been any rainfall.

09:49.927 --> 09:52.050
But there is Earth-type vegetation.

09:52.221 --> 09:55.305
Is it possible the vegetation could
absorb the water directly from the air?

09:55.474 --> 09:58.890
Yes, that's possible. There's also
the possibility of underground water.

09:59.061 --> 10:00.342
Yes, sir, could be.

10:00.521 --> 10:03.059
Sulu's picked up an organism
that's almost a virus.

10:03.232 --> 10:04.513
Like a plant parasite.

10:04.692 --> 10:07.230
And it's the nearest biological
form of life that I can find.

10:07.403 --> 10:09.775
This apparently is gonna our home
for as long as we can last.

10:09.947 --> 10:12.236
I suggest we find out
as much as we can about it.

10:12.408 --> 10:15.196
We'll split up. D'Amato,
see if you can find underground water.

10:15.370 --> 10:18.370
- Yes, sir.
- Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis.

10:18.539 --> 10:21.077
Bones, see if you can find out

10:21.250 --> 10:24.251
anything about the vegetation
and your parasite.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.580
How do they get their moisture?

10:26.755 --> 10:30.624
If you can discover how they survive,
maybe we can.

10:44.774 --> 10:45.937
Sulu to captain.

10:47.026 --> 10:48.105
Kirk here.

10:48.277 --> 10:51.112
Captain, I was making
a standard magnetic sweep.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.949
From zero, I suddenly got a reading
that was off the scale,

10:54.116 --> 10:55.944
then a reverse of polarity and...

10:56.953 --> 10:58.447
Now I get nothing.

10:58.621 --> 11:00.614
I've never seen anything
like this reading.

11:01.166 --> 11:05.459
Like a door opened
and then closed again.

11:08.799 --> 11:10.293
Kirk out.

12:04.647 --> 12:05.927
Do not be afraid.

12:07.066 --> 12:08.394
I'm not.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.275
Geological disturbances
don't frighten me.

12:10.444 --> 12:11.724
I've come here to study them.

12:11.903 --> 12:15.522
- They're my speciality.
- I know.

12:15.700 --> 12:19.483
You are Lieutenant D'Amato,
senior geologist.

12:19.662 --> 12:23.706
- That's right. How did you know that?
- From the spaceship Enterprise.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.289
Yes, and we're stranded here.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.749
Have you been talking
to my friends?

12:30.715 --> 12:32.707
Do not be afraid.

12:33.759 --> 12:35.586
I'm not afraid.

12:36.637 --> 12:39.673
I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato.

12:42.352 --> 12:44.724
You're... You're the woman
on the Enterprise.

12:45.438 --> 12:47.726
I am only for D'Amato.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.771
Lucky D'Amato.

12:52.069 --> 12:54.145
Wanna have a conference
about sharing food and water.

12:54.321 --> 12:56.030
Do not call the others.

12:56.741 --> 12:58.318
Please.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.657
- McCoy to Kirk.
- Kirk here.

13:08.210 --> 13:11.128
Jim, I just got a life-form reading
of tremendous intensity.

13:11.297 --> 13:12.756
Suddenly it was just there.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.841
- What do you mean, "just there"?
- Just that.

13:16.010 --> 13:17.173
All levels were normal

13:17.345 --> 13:21.176
and then I get this biological surge
of life-form registering.

13:22.767 --> 13:23.965
No. Now it's gone.

13:24.144 --> 13:27.097
As though a door opened and closed.

13:27.272 --> 13:29.941
- Yes.
- What direction?

13:32.777 --> 13:35.612
- Zero-eight-three.
- Hang on.

13:35.779 --> 13:38.153
D'Amato's section, come in.

13:38.325 --> 13:42.488
Kirk to D'Amato. Come in. Come in.

13:42.662 --> 13:45.117
Bones, Sulu,
D'Amato doesn't answer.

13:45.289 --> 13:46.452
I'll be right there.

13:57.260 --> 13:58.920
Bones!

14:11.107 --> 14:14.523
Jim, every cell in his body's
been disrupted.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.867
Jim, what are you doing?

14:31.045 --> 14:32.587
Digging a grave.

14:32.754 --> 14:36.704
Poor D'Amato.
What a terrible way to die.

14:36.883 --> 14:39.837
There are no good ways, Sulu.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.527
- That's the same red rock.
- My phaser didn't cut through.

14:59.406 --> 15:01.399
Whatever it is,
it has a mighty high melting point.

15:01.575 --> 15:02.903
Eight thousand degrees centigrade.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.279
It looks like igneous rock,
but infinitely denser.

15:21.928 --> 15:24.136
This whole planet
must be made up of this substance,

15:24.307 --> 15:25.765
covered over by topsoil.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.214
Mr. Sulu,

15:27.393 --> 15:30.678
it might explain this place a little better
if we knew what the substance is.

15:30.854 --> 15:34.389
I know it was D'Amato's field,
but see what you can find out.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.567
Yes, sir.

15:39.322 --> 15:43.818
Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is
the best we can provide for D'Amato.

15:43.993 --> 15:45.535
Yeah.

15:45.703 --> 15:48.703
It might be the most suitable
memorial at that.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.119
I wonder what killed him.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.917
I don't know.

16:00.092 --> 16:04.802
But something or someone did.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.178
We're holding warp 8.4, sir.

16:13.356 --> 16:14.435
If we can maintain it,

16:14.607 --> 16:18.273
our estimated time of arrival
is 11 and one-half solar hours.

16:18.445 --> 16:23.023
11.337 hours, lieutenant.
I wish you would be more precise.

16:23.199 --> 16:25.986
Scott to Bridge.
Scott to Bridge.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.788
- Spock here.
- Mr. Spock, the ship feels wrong.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.451
"Feels," Mr. Scott?

16:34.127 --> 16:35.290
I know it doesn't make sense.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.665
Instrumentation reads correct
but the feel is wrong.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.713
It's something
I can't quite put into words.

16:40.883 --> 16:42.377
That is obvious, Mr. Scott.

16:42.552 --> 16:44.295
I suggest you avoid emotionalism

16:44.470 --> 16:46.380
and simply
keep your instruments correct.

16:46.556 --> 16:48.465
Spock out.

17:22.675 --> 17:25.047
It looks so lonely there.

17:25.219 --> 17:28.305
It would be worse
if he had company.

17:28.473 --> 17:31.011
Doctor, how can you joke about it?

17:31.184 --> 17:34.351
I'm not joking. Until we know
what killed him, none of us are safe.

17:35.313 --> 17:38.729
We've gotta figure this out
and devise a defence against it.

17:38.901 --> 17:41.688
Is it possible the rocks have life?

17:41.862 --> 17:44.020
You remember on Janus VI,
the silicon creatures...

17:44.198 --> 17:45.692
But our instruments recorded that.

17:45.866 --> 17:48.950
They were life forms.
They registered as life forms.

17:49.119 --> 17:51.491
Unless we're dealing with beings...

17:51.663 --> 17:54.202
Intelligent beings
who can shield themselves.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.866
Beings intelligent enough
to have destroyed the Enterprise?

17:57.044 --> 18:00.543
That's the problem, Sulu.
We have only questions.

18:00.714 --> 18:02.089
No answers.

18:44.091 --> 18:45.715
Watkins.

18:46.678 --> 18:51.256
Check the bypass valve on the
matter/antimatter reaction chamber.

18:51.432 --> 18:52.595
Make sure it's not overheating.

18:52.767 --> 18:55.174
But, Mr. Scott,
the board shows correct.

18:55.352 --> 18:57.559
I didn't ask you
to check the board, lad.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.272
Yes, sir.

19:17.750 --> 19:18.782
Who are you?

19:20.461 --> 19:22.786
My name is not important.

19:22.964 --> 19:26.083
Yours is Watkins. John B.

19:26.258 --> 19:27.967
Engineer Grade 4.

19:28.136 --> 19:29.879
You know all about me.

19:30.055 --> 19:31.335
I've never seen you before.

19:32.932 --> 19:36.799
Show me this unit. I wish to learn.

19:39.313 --> 19:42.101
This is the matter/antimatter
integrator control.

19:42.275 --> 19:43.817
That's the cutoff switch.

19:43.985 --> 19:45.314
Not correct.

19:48.323 --> 19:50.992
That is the emergency
overload bypass,

19:51.159 --> 19:53.829
which engages
almost instantaneously.

19:54.997 --> 19:56.740
A wise precaution

19:56.915 --> 20:00.035
considering it takes
the antimatter longer to explode

20:00.210 --> 20:03.376
once the magnetic flow fails.

20:08.010 --> 20:10.216
I am for you, Mr. Watkins.

20:11.763 --> 20:15.761
Mr. Scott, there's a strange woman
who knows the plan of the Enterprise.

20:27.195 --> 20:29.947
Oh, you poor lad.

20:31.783 --> 20:35.235
- Scott to Bridge. Scott to Bridge.
- Spock here.

20:35.412 --> 20:38.247
My assistant, Watkins, is dead.

20:38.415 --> 20:40.740
Do you know what he died of,
Mr. Scott?

20:40.918 --> 20:42.293
I didn't see it happen,

20:42.461 --> 20:45.212
but his last words were a warning cry
about some strange woman.

20:47.465 --> 20:48.925
Security alert, all decks.

20:49.093 --> 20:51.216
Female intruder,
extremely dangerous.

20:51.387 --> 20:54.720
Security alert, all decks.

20:57.059 --> 20:58.173
Conclusions.

20:58.351 --> 21:02.220
The basic substance of this planet
is an alloy of diburnium-osmium.

21:02.398 --> 21:04.189
It couldn't have evolved naturally.

21:04.358 --> 21:05.556
Captain, it doesn't make sense.

21:05.734 --> 21:07.643
In fact, nothing
about this planet makes sense.

21:07.820 --> 21:11.070
Except for a momentary fluctuation
on your instruments,

21:11.240 --> 21:13.944
this planet has no magnetic field.

21:14.117 --> 21:16.905
The apparent age of these rocks
is only a few thousand years.

21:17.079 --> 21:20.413
No known process could evolve
the plant life they have here

21:20.583 --> 21:22.242
in that short space of time.

21:22.418 --> 21:24.909
Are you suggesting
this might be an artificial planet?

21:25.087 --> 21:26.914
But, captain,
where are the people who made it?

21:27.089 --> 21:28.916
Why can't we see them?

21:29.092 --> 21:30.467
Planet might be hollow.

21:30.635 --> 21:34.253
They might be shielding themselves
from our sensor probes.

21:34.430 --> 21:36.257
It's dark. Let's get some rest.

21:36.432 --> 21:38.673
Tomorrow we'll have to find
some food and some water,

21:38.851 --> 21:40.890
or it's going to be
a very unpleasant stay.

21:41.061 --> 21:43.518
- While it lasts.
- I'll take the first watch, sir.

21:43.690 --> 21:45.100
All right.

21:45.274 --> 21:48.109
Take D'Amato's tricorder.
Set it for automatic distress.

21:48.277 --> 21:51.029
- You never can tell.
- Aye, sir.

22:16.681 --> 22:20.132
Spock to Sickbay. Have you completed
the autopsy on Watkins, doctor?

22:20.309 --> 22:21.472
Yes, we have, Mr. Spock.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.139
Was the cause of his death

22:23.313 --> 22:25.638
the same as that which killed
the transporter officer?

22:26.149 --> 22:28.770
Well, the pattern of cellular disruption
was the same.

22:28.943 --> 22:32.229
But as to the cause, well,
your guess is as good as mine.

22:33.489 --> 22:36.906
My guess, doctor,
would be valueless.

22:37.077 --> 22:39.994
I suggest we refrain from guessing
and find some facts.

22:40.163 --> 22:41.741
Spock out.

22:44.334 --> 22:50.918
The power of this intruder
to disrupt every cell in a body,

22:51.091 --> 22:53.664
combined with the almost
inconceivable power

22:53.844 --> 22:56.513
required to hurl the Enterprise
such a distance,

22:57.514 --> 23:00.965
speak of a very high culture
and a very great danger.

23:01.142 --> 23:02.803
You mean that one of the people

23:02.978 --> 23:05.599
that threw us 1,000 light years away
from that planet

23:05.772 --> 23:07.931
is onboard and killing our people?

23:08.650 --> 23:10.856
A reasonable assumption, Mr. Scott.

23:11.027 --> 23:15.025
Then you're right, Mr. Spock.
Watkins must have been murdered.

23:15.198 --> 23:17.986
I sent him in to check
the matter/antimatter reactor.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.283
There are no exposed circuits there.

23:20.454 --> 23:22.446
It couldn't have been
anything he touched.

23:22.622 --> 23:26.406
If there are more of those beings
on that planet,

23:26.584 --> 23:30.713
the captain and the others
are in very great danger.

23:39.723 --> 23:41.715
I am unarmed.

23:43.394 --> 23:46.430
- Who are you?
- That is not important.

23:49.733 --> 23:53.268
You are Lieutenant Sulu.
You were born on the planet Earth.

23:53.445 --> 23:55.651
You are helmsman
for the Enterprise.

23:55.822 --> 23:58.279
How do you know this?
Where did you get this information?

23:58.451 --> 24:01.321
- Are you from this planet?
- I am from here.

24:01.495 --> 24:04.911
Then the planet is hollow.
Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato?

24:07.584 --> 24:10.835
All right. The captain will want
to talk to you. That way.

24:12.757 --> 24:14.251
Move.

24:15.301 --> 24:17.756
You do not understand.

24:18.262 --> 24:20.753
I have come for you.

24:20.931 --> 24:22.390
What do you want?

24:22.558 --> 24:25.927
I want to touch you.

24:27.188 --> 24:28.267
You were on the Enterprise.

24:30.691 --> 24:32.434
Keep back.

24:32.610 --> 24:33.938
Stop or I'll shoot.

24:34.111 --> 24:36.353
I don't wanna have to kill a woman.

24:49.752 --> 24:52.457
Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk!

25:02.806 --> 25:04.302
Hold it.

25:05.018 --> 25:06.049
Who are you?

25:06.936 --> 25:08.976
I am for him.
I am for Lieutenant Sulu.

25:09.147 --> 25:10.641
Don't let her touch you, captain.

25:10.815 --> 25:13.520
That's how D'Amato died.
Phasers won't stop her.

25:13.693 --> 25:14.891
I am for Lieutenant Sulu.

25:15.569 --> 25:17.693
Please. I must touch him.

25:26.164 --> 25:27.658
How can you destroy others
and not me?

25:29.166 --> 25:33.165
I don't want to destroy.
I don't want to.

25:33.338 --> 25:36.007
Who are you?
Why are you trying to kill us?

25:38.176 --> 25:39.338
Only Sulu.

25:42.221 --> 25:43.680
I mean you no harm.

25:46.393 --> 25:47.852
Are there men on this planet?

25:49.688 --> 25:54.065
Please, I must touch him.
I am for Lieutenant Sulu.

25:54.234 --> 25:55.977
No!

26:07.455 --> 26:08.534
Bones, did you see that?

26:10.291 --> 26:12.368
Maybe Spock was wrong.

26:13.087 --> 26:15.293
Perhaps this is a ghost planet.

26:15.464 --> 26:18.548
All I know is that she almost
made a ghost out of Sulu.

26:18.717 --> 26:21.338
His shoulder, where she touched it,
every cell has been disrupted.

26:21.511 --> 26:22.970
Exploded from within.

26:23.138 --> 26:24.929
If she'd gotten
a good grip on him, Jim...

26:25.099 --> 26:26.890
How can such people be, captain?

26:29.228 --> 26:31.054
Such evil,

26:31.230 --> 26:34.764
and she's so... So beautiful.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.100
Yes, I know.

26:45.911 --> 26:48.912
Security sweeps of all decks
are negative, Mr. Spock.

26:49.081 --> 26:50.361
No evidence of intruder.

26:50.540 --> 26:53.246
Very well. Cancel red alert
but maintain increased security.

26:53.419 --> 26:54.498
Aye, sir.

26:54.670 --> 26:58.584
All decks cancel red alert.
Maintain increased security.

26:58.757 --> 27:01.082
Update our subspace report
to Starfleet

27:01.260 --> 27:04.711
to include "security search:
Results negative."

27:04.888 --> 27:06.798
How did she get off the ship, sir?

27:06.974 --> 27:09.596
Presumably,
the same way she got on.

27:09.769 --> 27:11.346
Yes, sir.

27:11.520 --> 27:13.014
Mr. Spock,

27:13.606 --> 27:17.354
what are the chances of the captain
and the others being alive?

27:18.610 --> 27:20.438
Lieutenant, we are not
engaged in gambling.

27:20.947 --> 27:23.023
We are proceeding
in the only logical way,

27:23.199 --> 27:25.072
to return to the place
where they were last seen

27:25.242 --> 27:28.943
and factually ascertain
whether or not they still live.

27:31.373 --> 27:32.785
Yes, Mr. Spock.

27:32.959 --> 27:37.170
Mr. Spock, speed has increased
to warp 8.8.

27:38.089 --> 27:40.544
- Bridge to Engineering.
- Scotty here. I see it.

27:41.592 --> 27:43.466
It's a power surge.
I'm working on it.

27:43.636 --> 27:45.794
Reduce speed
until I locate the trouble.

27:45.972 --> 27:50.468
- Very well. Reduce speed to warp 7.
- Aye, sir. Warp 7.

27:51.811 --> 27:56.971
Mr. Spock. Our speed has increased
to warp 8.9 and still climbing.

27:57.149 --> 27:58.264
Bridge to Engineering.

27:58.442 --> 28:00.981
Negative effect on power reduction.
Speed is still increasing.

28:05.116 --> 28:08.983
Aye, Mr. Spock,
and I've found out why.

28:09.161 --> 28:10.537
The emergency bypass control

28:10.705 --> 28:13.078
of the matter/antimatter integrator
is fused.

28:13.250 --> 28:14.827
It's completely useless.

28:15.001 --> 28:18.204
The engines are running wild.
There's no way to get at them.

28:18.379 --> 28:21.001
We should reach maximum overload
in about 15 minutes.

28:21.174 --> 28:25.218
I would calculate 14.87 minutes,
Mr. Scott.

28:26.346 --> 28:29.513
Those few seconds will not make
any difference, Mr. Spock,

28:29.683 --> 28:31.675
because you and I
and the rest of the crew

28:31.851 --> 28:34.389
will no longer be here
to bandy it back and forth.

28:35.271 --> 28:38.438
This thing is going to blow up.

28:39.275 --> 28:41.897
And there's nothing
in the universe that can stop it.

28:54.875 --> 28:59.122
There's a layer of necrotic tissue
a few cells thick.

28:59.296 --> 29:01.419
A normal wound would heal quickly.

29:01.590 --> 29:04.045
She just touched me.

29:04.217 --> 29:06.256
How could it happen so fast?

29:06.427 --> 29:08.385
That's a good question.

29:08.555 --> 29:12.849
She touched the transporter chief
and he collapsed immediately.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.517
She apparently got to D'Amato.
We saw what happened to him.

29:16.688 --> 29:19.891
Question is, why are you alive?

29:20.066 --> 29:22.439
Captain, I'm happy
the way it turned out.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.238
Jim.

29:26.573 --> 29:28.898
What kind of power must she have?

29:29.076 --> 29:32.943
The power to totally disrupt
biological cell structure.

29:33.121 --> 29:35.909
Sulu's alive because I intervened.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.752
But that raises
an even worse question.

29:40.254 --> 29:42.376
Why didn't she kill you?

29:44.841 --> 29:46.086
She's not through yet.

29:56.812 --> 30:00.097
It's useless.
And there's no question, it's deliberate.

30:00.273 --> 30:03.061
- Sabotage.
- Aye. And a thorough job.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.778
The system's foolproof.

30:04.945 --> 30:08.065
Whoever murdered Watkins
sabotaged this.

30:09.116 --> 30:11.607
You said it was fused. How?

30:11.785 --> 30:14.193
- Well, that's what worries me.
- "Worries," Mr. Scott?

30:14.372 --> 30:16.530
Well, it's fused all right,

30:16.707 --> 30:20.491
but it would take all the power
of our main phaser banks to do it.

30:20.669 --> 30:22.128
Interesting.

30:22.296 --> 30:25.499
I find nothing interesting in the fact
that we're about to blow up.

30:25.674 --> 30:30.004
No. But the method is fascinating.

30:31.389 --> 30:34.888
Whatever did this
is still aboard this ship.

30:35.059 --> 30:38.594
I fail to understand
why you've cancelled the security alert.

30:38.771 --> 30:42.472
A force that could hurl us
990.7 light years away,

30:42.650 --> 30:43.813
and at that distance,

30:43.985 --> 30:46.820
still be able to sabotage
our main source of energy,

30:46.988 --> 30:49.526
will not be waiting around
to be taken into custody.

30:49.699 --> 30:50.979
Aye.

30:51.158 --> 30:53.234
As I recall the pattern
of our fuel flow,

30:53.410 --> 30:54.442
there is an access tube

30:54.620 --> 30:56.779
leading to the matter/antimatter
reaction chamber.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.830
Aye, there's a service crawlway,

30:59.000 --> 31:01.787
but it's not meant to be used
while the integrator operates.

31:01.961 --> 31:02.992
Still, it is there.

31:03.171 --> 31:06.171
And it might be possible to shut off
the flow of fuel at that point.

31:06.340 --> 31:09.176
What with? Bare hands?

31:09.844 --> 31:12.086
A magnetic probe.

31:12.555 --> 31:17.715
Any matter that comes in contact
with antimatter triggers the explosion.

31:17.894 --> 31:21.013
And I'm not even sure a man
can live in a crawlway

31:21.188 --> 31:23.016
in the energy stream
of the magnetic field

31:23.191 --> 31:24.983
that bottles up the antimatter.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.183
I shall try.

31:27.237 --> 31:28.861
You'll be killed, man.

31:29.030 --> 31:32.944
Unless a solution is found quickly,
that fate awaits all of us.

31:34.035 --> 31:36.242
Aye. You're right.

31:36.413 --> 31:37.611
What have we got to lose?

31:38.373 --> 31:40.247
But I'll do it, Mr. Spock.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.456
I know every millimetre
of that system.

31:42.627 --> 31:44.121
I'll do whatever has to be done.

31:44.295 --> 31:45.540
Very well, Mr. Scott.

31:45.713 --> 31:49.048
You spoke of the feel of the ship
being wrong.

31:49.218 --> 31:51.969
Aye. It was an emotional statement.

31:52.137 --> 31:54.046
I don't expect you to understand it.

31:54.931 --> 31:58.929
I note it, Mr. Scott,
without necessarily understanding it.

31:59.102 --> 32:01.853
I propose to run an analysis
through the ship's computers

32:02.021 --> 32:04.264
comparing the present condition
of the Enterprise

32:04.441 --> 32:05.935
with her ideal condition.

32:06.109 --> 32:08.185
Mr. Spock,
we don't have time for that.

32:08.362 --> 32:10.734
We have 12 minutes
and 27 seconds.

32:10.906 --> 32:13.396
I suggest you do whatever you can
in the service crawlway

32:13.575 --> 32:16.280
while I make the computer study.

32:19.373 --> 32:21.531
Sulu, do you feel strong enough
to move about?

32:21.708 --> 32:23.535
- I feel fine, captain.
- Is he, Bones?

32:23.710 --> 32:24.908
He's in fair shape.

32:25.087 --> 32:26.794
All right.

32:26.963 --> 32:29.289
Whatever destructive power
this woman has

32:29.467 --> 32:33.049
seems to be aimed at one
specific person at one specific time.

32:33.220 --> 32:34.714
If I'm correct, when she reappears,

32:34.888 --> 32:37.130
the other two might be able
to protect the one she's after

32:37.307 --> 32:40.308
by interposing their bodies.
No weapons seem to affect her.

32:40.477 --> 32:42.351
But, captain,
how does she know about us?

32:42.521 --> 32:44.099
Does she read our minds?

32:44.273 --> 32:46.016
Phaser on overload.

32:46.192 --> 32:48.231
Controls are fused. Drop.

32:57.286 --> 33:00.240
Apparently she can destroy
our weapons

33:00.414 --> 33:01.659
as well as destroy us.

33:01.832 --> 33:03.410
Come on, let's go.

33:10.883 --> 33:13.042
All right, lads.
Get the crawlway door open.

33:13.219 --> 33:15.093
Hand me the tools.

33:18.307 --> 33:21.676
Communicator. All right. Head first.

33:21.852 --> 33:25.304
I hope Mr. Spock
knows what he's doing.

33:57.347 --> 34:00.098
- Scott to Bridge.
- Go ahead, Mr. Scott.

34:00.266 --> 34:03.183
I've sealed off the aft end
of the service crawlway

34:03.352 --> 34:05.511
and I've positioned
explosive separator charges

34:05.689 --> 34:09.472
to blast me clear of the ship
if I rupture the magnetic bottle.

34:09.650 --> 34:12.402
I'm so close to the flow now

34:12.570 --> 34:15.773
it feels like ants
crawling all over my body.

34:16.574 --> 34:20.524
Mr. Scott, I suggest you refrain from
any further subjective descriptions.

34:20.704 --> 34:22.743
You now have
ten minutes and 19 seconds

34:22.914 --> 34:24.705
in which to perform your task.

34:24.873 --> 34:28.324
Mr. Spock,
we're at warp 11.2 and accelerating.

34:28.503 --> 34:29.783
I heard that.

34:29.962 --> 34:33.746
The ship's not structured to take
that speed for any length of time.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.840
You now have ten minutes
and ten seconds.

34:47.397 --> 34:48.594
All right, Mr. Spock.

34:49.483 --> 34:52.934
I'm starting to open
the access panel now.

34:53.445 --> 34:55.235
Access to the flow itself.

34:55.405 --> 35:00.233
If the magnetic flow jumps,
you must jettison me.

35:00.410 --> 35:02.237
The safety control

35:02.412 --> 35:05.497
will not hold more than two seconds

35:05.665 --> 35:07.658
if I rupture the field.

35:07.834 --> 35:11.998
I'm aware of these facts.
Please get on with the job.

35:12.172 --> 35:13.548
- Computer?
- Working.

35:13.716 --> 35:16.716
Analysis on my comparison
coordinates.

35:16.885 --> 35:18.545
Unable to comply.

35:18.720 --> 35:22.136
Comparison coordinates too complex
for immediate readout.

35:22.307 --> 35:25.225
Will advise upon completion.

35:49.418 --> 35:51.625
I've removed the access plate

35:51.796 --> 35:56.089
and I've got static-electric charges
dancing on the instruments.

35:56.258 --> 35:59.343
Looks like an aurora borealis
in there.

36:00.179 --> 36:02.800
Lieutenant Uhura, you are
monitoring the magnetic force?

36:02.973 --> 36:05.643
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Please do not take your eyes off it.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.849
- Aye, sir.
- Lieutenant Rahda,

36:08.020 --> 36:09.894
arm the pod jettison system.

36:10.064 --> 36:13.314
Aye, sir. I'll jettison the pod
at the first sign of trouble.

36:13.484 --> 36:15.939
Not until my order.

36:16.111 --> 36:17.570
Yes, sir.

36:17.738 --> 36:20.656
Warp 11.9.

36:26.664 --> 36:28.870
Mr. Scott, what is your situation?

36:30.167 --> 36:31.910
It's hard to see.

36:32.087 --> 36:33.331
There's so much disturbance

36:33.505 --> 36:36.078
that any attempt to get at the flow

36:36.257 --> 36:38.333
would rupture the magnetic field.

36:40.553 --> 36:44.930
You have eight minutes,
41 seconds.

36:45.099 --> 36:46.642
I know what time it is.

36:46.810 --> 36:49.561
I don't need
a blooming cuckoo clock.

36:51.439 --> 36:54.440
Captain, I'm getting that strange
magnetic sweep again.

36:54.609 --> 36:57.230
- From zero to off the scale.
- Yes.

36:57.737 --> 37:01.356
Like a door opening.

37:08.414 --> 37:09.743
Who have you come for this time?

37:10.458 --> 37:12.367
For you, James T. Kirk.

37:12.544 --> 37:13.955
Commander of the Enterprise.

37:29.061 --> 37:30.804
Keep behind us, Jim.

37:33.773 --> 37:34.852
Why do you wanna kill us?

37:35.024 --> 37:36.768
For defence.

37:36.943 --> 37:39.945
You are Captain James T. Kirk,
commander of the Enterprise.

37:40.114 --> 37:43.565
- Then why do you wanna kill me?
- You are an invader.

37:46.161 --> 37:48.070
We're here on a peaceful mission.

37:48.246 --> 37:50.535
It's you who've killed our people.
We mean no harm to you.

37:50.707 --> 37:52.498
We wanna leave peacefully.

37:52.667 --> 37:55.206
Captain, I'm getting
no life-form register.

37:55.379 --> 37:56.410
An android?

37:56.588 --> 37:59.589
No, that would give a mechanical
reading. I'm getting nothing.

38:07.433 --> 38:08.927
Who are you?

38:10.060 --> 38:12.765
I am Losira. Commander.

38:12.938 --> 38:15.773
- Commander of what?
- Of this station.

38:15.941 --> 38:18.645
Station? Station? Where?

38:23.407 --> 38:24.687
How do you feel about killing me?

38:25.617 --> 38:27.325
Feel?

38:28.620 --> 38:31.455
Killing is wrong.

38:31.623 --> 38:34.909
- Stay between us.
- You must not penetrate this station.

38:35.086 --> 38:37.411
Please, I must touch you.

38:38.339 --> 38:39.714
You want to kill me?

38:40.632 --> 38:42.043
No.

38:43.051 --> 38:45.127
Then why do it if you don't want to?

38:45.804 --> 38:48.177
I am sent.

38:49.809 --> 38:51.137
By whom?

38:54.355 --> 38:56.596
We defend this place.

38:56.774 --> 38:58.565
Are there others on this planet?

39:00.987 --> 39:03.478
They are

39:04.991 --> 39:06.698
no more.

39:11.246 --> 39:13.702
How long have you been alone?

39:15.168 --> 39:16.199
Are you lonely?

39:32.769 --> 39:36.054
- She must be somewhere.
- She's not registering.

39:41.945 --> 39:46.274
And there's this power surge,
right off the scale.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.489
Like a door closing.

39:50.536 --> 39:52.778
It must be near here.

39:56.459 --> 39:59.544
- Is the power level still holding, Jim?
- Right off the scale.

39:59.712 --> 40:02.713
It's remained at a peak
ever since she disappeared.

40:04.967 --> 40:08.384
The entrance is here.

40:19.440 --> 40:20.899
You think we're being invited in?

40:22.569 --> 40:24.277
Certainly looks like it.

40:24.446 --> 40:27.400
And the invitation
doesn't exactly relax me.

40:27.908 --> 40:29.402
I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir.

40:30.243 --> 40:31.737
I agree.

40:31.911 --> 40:34.532
We've been led here. Why?

40:35.999 --> 40:37.826
I don't know.

40:38.585 --> 40:43.211
But whatever civilisation exists
on this planet is in there.

40:43.590 --> 40:45.417
And without the Enterprise,
gentlemen,

40:45.592 --> 40:48.083
the only source of food and water

40:48.262 --> 40:51.381
is in there.

40:52.724 --> 40:54.266
Let's go.

41:13.745 --> 41:15.073
Computer readout.

41:15.247 --> 41:17.703
Comparison analysis complete.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.286
Continue.

41:19.460 --> 41:26.173
Transporter factor M7
reassembled outphase.0009.

41:26.341 --> 41:29.711
- Fifty-seven seconds to go, sir.
- Understood.

41:29.887 --> 41:32.129
- Mr. Spock?
- Spock here.

41:32.306 --> 41:34.464
I'm gonna try to cut through
the magnetic flow.

41:34.642 --> 41:39.469
But if the probe doesn't
precisely match the magnetic flow,

41:39.646 --> 41:41.022
there will be an explosion.

41:45.653 --> 41:48.488
Starting right now.

41:54.328 --> 41:56.487
Magnetic-force indicator jumping,
Mr. Spock.

41:56.664 --> 41:58.158
Mr. Scott, ease off.

42:03.838 --> 42:05.711
Magnetic force
has dropped to normal, sir.

42:05.881 --> 42:07.162
Warp 13.2, sir.

42:07.341 --> 42:10.129
Computer, for outphase condition,

42:10.303 --> 42:12.758
will reverse field achieve closure?

42:12.930 --> 42:17.557
Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained.

42:21.522 --> 42:25.141
Mr. Scott, reverse polarity
on your magnetic probe.

42:25.318 --> 42:26.433
Reverse polarity?

42:26.611 --> 42:27.856
That is correct, Mr. Scott.

42:28.029 --> 42:31.030
That will take some doing.
What purpose could it..?

42:31.199 --> 42:32.858
Please commence. I'll explain.

42:33.617 --> 42:35.361
You were correct in your "feel."

42:35.536 --> 42:37.862
The Enterprise was put through
a molecular transporter

42:38.039 --> 42:40.530
and reassembled out of phase.

42:40.708 --> 42:43.543
Reverse polarity
should seal the incision.

42:43.711 --> 42:46.036
No time for theory.
I just hope you're right.

42:46.214 --> 42:47.756
Twenty seconds, Mr. Spock.

42:47.923 --> 42:50.546
I'm doing the best I can. Wait.

42:53.805 --> 42:55.548
It's stuck.

43:04.399 --> 43:06.522
It's stuck. Push the button.

43:06.693 --> 43:08.317
Please continue, Mr. Scott.

43:08.486 --> 43:10.479
Don't be a fool. Push the button.

43:10.655 --> 43:12.149
It's your last chance.

43:12.323 --> 43:13.948
Don't be sentimental. Push it.

43:14.117 --> 43:15.148
I'm gonna die anyway.

43:15.326 --> 43:16.738
Please continue.

43:24.753 --> 43:27.706
It's loose. But there's no time.
Push the button.

43:27.881 --> 43:31.961
Nine seconds, eight seconds,
seven seconds,

43:32.136 --> 43:36.050
six seconds, five seconds,
four seconds,

43:36.223 --> 43:39.638
three seconds, two seconds, one.

43:39.809 --> 43:41.802
Mr. Spock, now.

43:51.363 --> 43:53.984
Warp 14.1.

43:54.449 --> 43:55.777
Warp 14.

43:57.119 --> 43:59.657
Magnetic forces steady.

44:03.792 --> 44:05.950
Warp 13.9 and dropping.

44:07.003 --> 44:09.708
Mr. Scott,
you have accomplished your task.

44:09.881 --> 44:12.669
You might at least say thank you.

44:14.345 --> 44:15.969
For what purpose, Mr. Scott?

44:16.138 --> 44:17.881
- What is it in you humans..?
- Never mind.

44:18.056 --> 44:20.096
- That requires an overwhelming
display of emotion

44:20.267 --> 44:22.390
in a situation such as this?

44:22.561 --> 44:26.310
Two men pursue the only reasonable
course of action indicated

44:26.482 --> 44:30.479
and yet you feel
that something else is necessary.

44:55.678 --> 44:56.709
Who have you come for?

45:01.684 --> 45:03.343
Form a circle.

45:07.106 --> 45:11.056
You see? You'd better tell us.

45:13.446 --> 45:16.861
Tell us. Who have you come for?

45:17.408 --> 45:19.318
Who have you come for?

45:26.250 --> 45:27.910
You're a very determined woman.
For me?

45:28.085 --> 45:30.457
I am for James T. Kirk.

45:31.756 --> 45:33.548
Gentlemen, I need your help.

45:33.717 --> 45:35.424
Please.

45:35.593 --> 45:39.092
I must touch you. I beg it.
It is my existence.

45:39.263 --> 45:41.386
We've seen the results
of your touch.

45:44.018 --> 45:47.553
But you are my match, James Kirk.
I must touch you.

45:47.731 --> 45:51.728
Then I will live as one,
even to the structure of your cells,

45:51.901 --> 45:54.273
the arrangement of chromosomes.

45:54.904 --> 45:57.110
That is how you kill.

45:59.826 --> 46:01.819
You'll never reach me.

46:03.663 --> 46:05.620
- Watch out!
- I am for McCoy.

46:08.835 --> 46:11.789
That computer must be
programming these replicas.

46:11.964 --> 46:14.633
Women match our chromosome
patterns after they touch us.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.125
It's a very painful affair,
I can tell you.

46:17.761 --> 46:20.596
- I am for Sulu.
- Shift positions.

46:20.764 --> 46:22.507
Captain, we can no longer
protect each other.

46:38.991 --> 46:40.818
Spock! The computer! Destroy it!

46:54.131 --> 46:56.836
Oh, Mr. Spock,
I certainly am glad to see you.

46:57.009 --> 46:58.752
I thought the Enterprise
had been destroyed.

46:58.927 --> 47:01.252
I had the same misgivings
about you, captain.

47:01.430 --> 47:04.466
We returned and picked up your
life-form readings only a moment ago.

47:04.641 --> 47:05.922
Returned from where?

47:06.102 --> 47:09.470
From where this brain
had the power to send the Enterprise:

47:09.647 --> 47:13.644
990.7 light years across the galaxy.

47:13.817 --> 47:15.442
What a remarkable culture this is.

47:15.611 --> 47:18.481
Was, Mr. Spock.
Its defences were run by computer.

47:18.655 --> 47:23.282
I surmised that, captain.
Its moves were immensely logical.

47:23.452 --> 47:26.488
But what people created this?
Are there any representatives here?

47:26.664 --> 47:29.451
There were replicas of one of them.

47:29.625 --> 47:32.412
But that power to re-create them
has been destroyed.

47:32.586 --> 47:34.828
That is a loss, captain.

47:35.006 --> 47:38.505
Well, you wouldn't have thought so,
Mr. Spock, if you'd been among us.

47:42.805 --> 47:45.675
My fellow Kalandans, welcome.

47:45.849 --> 47:50.097
A disease has destroyed us.
Beware of it.

47:50.271 --> 47:53.521
After your long journey, I'm sorry
to give you only a recorded welcome.

47:54.358 --> 47:56.849
But we who have guarded
the outpost for you

47:57.027 --> 48:00.314
will be dead by the time
you take possession of this planet.

48:00.865 --> 48:04.697
I am the last
of our advanced force left alive.

48:04.994 --> 48:08.908
Too late the physicians discovered
the cause of the sickness that kills us.

48:09.081 --> 48:11.157
In creating this planet,

48:11.333 --> 48:15.546
we have accidentally produced
a deadly organism.

48:15.713 --> 48:20.090
I have awaited the regular supply ship
from home for medical assistance,

48:20.259 --> 48:23.675
but I doubt now
whether it will arrive in time.

48:24.096 --> 48:27.431
I will set the outpost controls
on automatic.

48:27.976 --> 48:32.602
The computer will selectively defend
against all life forms but our own.

48:34.607 --> 48:36.730
My fellow Kalandans,

48:37.652 --> 48:41.899
I, Losira, wish you well.

48:43.575 --> 48:44.737
The previous ships

48:44.909 --> 48:47.696
probably spread the disease
all through their people.

48:47.871 --> 48:50.112
The supply ship
that she was waiting for never came.

48:50.289 --> 48:52.081
All these thousands of years

48:52.250 --> 48:56.414
she's been waiting to greet people
who were dead.

48:56.588 --> 48:59.340
To do the job of defence,

48:59.507 --> 49:03.208
the computer projected a replica
of the only image available:

49:03.386 --> 49:05.010
Losira's.

49:05.179 --> 49:07.303
The computer was too perfect.

49:07.724 --> 49:11.224
It projected so much
of Losira's personality into the replica

49:11.395 --> 49:15.558
that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.

49:15.732 --> 49:18.353
That bought us the time
we needed to destroy it.

49:20.194 --> 49:23.695
She must have been
a remarkable woman.

49:23.866 --> 49:25.146
And beautiful.

49:26.535 --> 49:29.108
Beauty is transitory, doctor.

49:29.621 --> 49:33.618
However, she was,
evidently, highly intelligent.

49:33.791 --> 49:35.417
Kirk to Enterprise. Five to beam up.

49:35.586 --> 49:37.709
- I don't agree with you, Mr. Spock.
- Indeed, captain?

49:37.880 --> 49:39.457
Beauty

49:41.049 --> 49:42.627
survives.
