00:51.426 --> 00:52.427
<i>Chet-chet!</i>

00:59.518 --> 01:00.602
<i>Chet-chet-chet!</i>

01:58.202 --> 02:00.329
Dorian the Elder once said...

02:01.496 --> 02:05.292
"The most unsettling sound
in the human experience is silence...

02:06.168 --> 02:08.503
when nature begs for wailing."

02:09.213 --> 02:15.802
Silence in a birth, silence in a moment
of devastating heartbreak.

02:15.886 --> 02:20.474
Silence during the infliction
of such extreme pain.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.150
You've done yourself proud.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.987
Your defiance is powerful.

02:35.739 --> 02:39.076
Some men in my position
might find themselves affected by it...

02:40.327 --> 02:45.290
suddenly fighting the onset of pity,
their resolve weakened...

02:46.917 --> 02:48.502
and so on, and so on.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.339
Just to be clear, those men are cowards.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.344
There's a reason why I am in this position
and they aren't.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.973
And eight fingers from now...

03:02.140 --> 03:04.852
we start on toes.

03:09.398 --> 03:14.528
I will do this for days
until you tell me where my queen is.

03:35.966 --> 03:39.428
I have the destination
where the queen is being held.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.680
They won't be expecting us.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.807
It's days from here at a quick pace.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.560
The company is already preparing
to depart.

03:47.019 --> 03:50.022
There's only a few things
that we need to resolve before then.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.106
"Resolve"?

03:51.190 --> 03:53.984
First, the boy.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.906
I'm grateful he aided in the capture
of the two Shadows out there.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.575
Now...

04:03.493 --> 04:06.747
I'd like to know how he did it.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.210
He's not your son.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.505
That much was clear
the moment he was brought to you.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.635
But he has vision too, doesn't he?

04:22.638 --> 04:23.639
Yes.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.477
Another child of Jerlamarel's...

04:32.189 --> 04:33.649
with another woman.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
You deserved more than that.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.033
None of that is the boy's fault,
and you'd be nowhere without him.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.954
I'm the Witchfinder, Maghra, and there
is one sitting in my tent as we speak!

04:47.037 --> 04:50.040
Fault has nothing to do with it.
I can't simply ignore who he is.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.458
Of course you can!

04:52.751 --> 04:54.002
He's with me.

04:54.586 --> 04:58.090
He has my protection.
And I'm the daughter of the king.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.343
What else do you wanna resolve?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.847
Whether he comes with us.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.723
"Comes with us"?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.226
I'm moving this army.
I cannot leave you behind.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.437
Absolutely not.
I am not leaving until my family is found.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.606
It's been days,
and my scouts have found no signs of them.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.109
-You promised me!
-I promised to search.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.152
And from where I stand,
that promise is kept.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.488
Then you leave some of your men behind.
I will continue to search.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.366
I have no choice in this matter,
and neither do you.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.369
Boy...

05:30.956 --> 05:35.669
I have forgotten more about killing
than you will ever know.

05:36.587 --> 05:41.133
If you think because you have sight
that that will even the odds between us...

05:42.926 --> 05:44.136
think again.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.685
It's all right.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.026
This place is uninhabited.
There's little danger here.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.153
Just a few men could guarantee my safety.

06:01.486 --> 06:05.782
Maghra, the queen is compromised.

06:05.866 --> 06:09.119
She may be incapacitated. She may be dead.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.580
We don't know
who is governing the kingdom.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.374
We don't know
if anyone is governing the kingdom.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.545
The chaos that preceded your family's rule
was dire.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.716
Countless rivalries,
grievances and vendettas.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.637
Without a Kane on the throne to rule,
they will rear their heads again.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.016
And you are rightfully the next Kane
in the line of succession.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.981
I will leave a contingent behind
to continue looking for your family.

06:39.691 --> 06:41.443
But as far as your presence goes...

06:43.570 --> 06:46.073
this isn't a choice for either of us.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.423
You're in command of the men left behind?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.592
Yes, Your Highness. Four men under me.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.803
Eight would be better.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.763
Do it.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.852
You understand how important
your charge here is, yes?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.436
Yes, ma'am, of course.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.064
They're my life.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.649
Yes, ma'am.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.502
You must talk to your father.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.171
He doesn't wanna hear anything
I have to say.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.340
That is why you must talk to him.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.677
Why me?

08:30.761 --> 08:35.182
Haniwa,
it doesn't matter who speaks first.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.100
It is the way forward.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.480
You think it's simple.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.607
It is.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.610
Break this silence while you can.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.787
Why are we stopping?

08:57.788 --> 09:02.292
We'll camp here for the night.
Your father's gone ahead, scouting.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.590
How far off is it?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.717
How far is what?

09:12.803 --> 09:13.971
Oh, wow.

09:25.274 --> 09:29.027
I can't tell if I'm relieved
or if I was hoping we'd never find it.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.492
I'll go tell the others.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.188
How does a queen
who never leaves her palace

10:04.688 --> 10:08.442
end up by the side of the road with
nothing but a handmaiden and a driver?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.653
You think someone attempted
to move against her?

10:13.697 --> 10:15.782
I could imagine a number of things.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.827
I'm trying not to.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.496
She had enemies.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.540
Comes with the crown.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.084
More for some than others.

10:28.086 --> 10:30.088
She's my mother. You know that, don't you?

10:32.424 --> 10:36.678
Their faces, their voices,
the way they breathed, even.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.726
I was so young when my mother died,
but even then I knew it.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.396
The two of them were exactly the same.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.567
So when she died,

10:50.651 --> 10:56.031
it felt especially cruel
that every time my sister was nearby...

10:57.199 --> 11:01.620
to hear her, to smell her, to touch her...

11:04.498 --> 11:07.209
suddenly,
I'd be mourning my mother all over again.

11:10.295 --> 11:12.464
I imagine it was no different
to my father.

11:12.548 --> 11:16.844
I imagine that's why he could never
bring himself to take away the one thing

11:16.927 --> 11:19.555
she treasured above all else:

11:24.518 --> 11:26.061
her birthright.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.215
I brought food for her, as you asked.

11:56.049 --> 12:01.555
You can call her what she is.
There is no power or magic in it here.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.642
I brought food for the queen,
as you asked.

12:05.726 --> 12:06.768
Very well.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.992
Still not up to your standards, huh?

12:24.203 --> 12:29.333
I had heard stories of your stubbornness,
your self-destructiveness, even.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.379
When I first heard them, they seemed
outlandish to me, not to be trusted.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.631
But now...

12:37.257 --> 12:42.054
Perhaps you could confirm
or deny a few of them for me.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.808
I heard you killed lovers
for snoring in their sleep.

12:46.892 --> 12:50.354
Servants,
because you didn't like their smell.

12:51.438 --> 12:54.024
You severed the tongues of young maiden

12:54.358 --> 12:59.488
because they didn't please you
fast enough.

12:59.905 --> 13:05.911
Any of these you'd care to dispute,
or perhaps even claim credit for?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.885
You know the rules.

13:23.095 --> 13:26.431
The bell rings, and how do we know
you aren't trying to escape?

13:27.641 --> 13:29.560
The bell rings, and we must respond.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.730
The bell rings,
and you will suffer for it.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.609
Until your ransom is paid,

13:38.193 --> 13:41.947
you are an asset
that I intend to be very careful with.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.620
So why don't you just relax?

13:50.372 --> 13:53.208
Let us continue our conversation,
shall we?

13:55.043 --> 14:00.799
Please know, inasmuch as I found
those stories entertaining...

14:02.384 --> 14:07.389
the one that really interests me
involves a particular lover...

14:08.765 --> 14:11.768
who broke your heart and then left you.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.932
Haniwa.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.352
What I said before...

16:17.436 --> 16:18.729
I know.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.856
-It's just because...
-It's okay.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.275
-In the cave...
-I understand.

16:24.735 --> 16:25.736
You sure?

16:42.961 --> 16:43.962
Yeah.

16:55.516 --> 16:57.518
What do you think we're headed towards?

17:01.146 --> 17:04.608
Honestly, I think you need to manage
your expectations.

17:06.234 --> 17:09.363
To set aside what we know of him, okay?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.781
Set aside the fact
that he left his child to be abused

17:11.865 --> 17:13.032
until he turned into a monster.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.868
-We don't really know what actually happ--
-Mom didn't want this.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.876
I have no memory of her talking about him
without sounding sad.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.839
I have no memory of her talking about
any of this without warning us against it.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.637
I mean, that has to have been
for a reason, Haniwa.

17:38.642 --> 17:45.107
Don't you think it's strange that
she never told us what that reason was?

17:50.279 --> 17:51.488
I don't know...

17:52.656 --> 17:55.993
what was... in Mama's head.

17:56.827 --> 18:02.624
But I do know that she loved him.

18:05.627 --> 18:07.796
And there must be a reason for that.

18:30.027 --> 18:31.778
You heard it in your sleep.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.240
Is that an owl?

18:36.533 --> 18:40.245
Not an owl. That is a man.

18:41.622 --> 18:45.167
We're in the Badlands, Baba.
Lawless land.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.045
And you are not well.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.422
I'm fine.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.925
Do the children know?

18:53.967 --> 18:55.552
There's no need for them to know.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.097
They always know more than you think.

19:07.606 --> 19:09.024
Did Haniwa speak to you?

19:09.900 --> 19:10.984
Why?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.946
She's holding something...

19:14.905 --> 19:17.282
something that she cannot give voice to...

19:18.033 --> 19:19.660
and it frightens her.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.121
Well, she's mourning.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.249
So is Kofun.

19:25.791 --> 19:29.461
But he's not gripped by the same darkness.

19:31.505 --> 19:35.884
They're different.
They need different things at this moment.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.429
I would think you of all people
would understand what she needs.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.722
What do you mean?

19:45.227 --> 19:47.062
You remember when I first came to you?

19:48.355 --> 19:51.316
The rage, and how destructive I was?

19:53.110 --> 19:54.528
Because I was afraid.

19:56.154 --> 19:57.573
Afraid to trust you...

19:58.699 --> 20:02.536
afraid to believe that I actually escaped
and that it was true.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.248
And do you remember
what you told me when I did?

20:07.416 --> 20:11.003
I told you if you broke any more
of my things,

20:11.086 --> 20:13.088
I would kill you in your sleep.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.299
Yes. But after that...

20:16.675 --> 20:18.552
do you remember what you did?

20:21.221 --> 20:26.643
You sat and you stayed for as long as
it took me to be able to breathe again.

20:28.896 --> 20:32.608
You stayed so that I would know
I was not alone.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.446
Haniwa's lost.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.200
She's facing an uncertain future...

20:42.326 --> 20:45.746
a lost mother, and a new father.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.210
But I will give her the space she needs.

20:51.293 --> 20:54.421
And like you, I'll make sure
that she knows she's not alone.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.446
Paris, what is it?

21:24.493 --> 21:26.119
Lavender no more.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.414
I taste death.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.474
It's days, it's maybe weeks.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.061
It's human, isn't it?

22:26.430 --> 22:28.891
"A new world lies beyond.

22:30.976 --> 22:34.396
A new god resides within.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.112
Enter, and be seen.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.199
Enter, and be judged.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.203
Enter, and find death.

22:51.622 --> 22:53.123
Enter, and be seen."

22:55.334 --> 22:56.335
Jerlamarel.

22:58.128 --> 23:00.380
He's lost his fucking mind.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.049
Perhaps not.

23:02.883 --> 23:05.302
Maybe-- Maybe this is what happens

23:05.385 --> 23:09.014
when your work is important
and you don't want visitors.

23:09.097 --> 23:10.265
Paris, I don't know.

23:10.349 --> 23:15.729
You must know now how dangerous
it is to be sighted in this world.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.775
The lengths one must go to
to keep it at bay.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.443
I agree with Paris.

23:25.030 --> 23:28.575
We didn't come this far just to turn
around because of something like this.

23:29.201 --> 23:32.454
I want both of you to know
what we set out to know.

23:32.538 --> 23:35.207
I want to know
what we all sacrificed so much for.

23:38.043 --> 23:40.295
I want to know
what I sacrificed my wife for.

23:41.922 --> 23:43.298
I need to know it.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.469
Come.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.431
At least we know
we're going the right way.

23:54.935 --> 23:56.144
Kofun.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.068
We forge ahead.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.368
<i>I saw four guards.</i>

24:53.994 --> 24:57.581
One here, by the entrance.

24:58.415 --> 24:59.541
Two more...

25:00.792 --> 25:03.086
patrolling between
the rows of silk workers.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.589
And another by the second window.

25:05.672 --> 25:09.885
The workers are all stationary, then?
Only the guards are walking?

25:09.968 --> 25:13.555
Yes. And they tap their staffs
to announce their presence.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.266
What kind of shoes are the guards wearing?

25:17.726 --> 25:20.479
What kind of shoes?
Are they leather? Are they wood?

25:20.562 --> 25:22.439
Leather, I think.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.651
And what about the queen?
Do you know where she is?

25:26.944 --> 25:29.613
I don't know what the queen looks like.

25:30.113 --> 25:33.742
There was a bloodied woman here,
in the back.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.661
Bloodied? Is she alive?

25:35.744 --> 25:36.745
I don't know.

25:37.829 --> 25:41.291
So, you're certain?
Four guards and a space in between them?

25:41.375 --> 25:42.626
That's what I saw.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.628
That's what you saw.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.797
As if vision absolves you
from being wrong.

25:46.880 --> 25:48.882
You have enough men
to overwhelm them, don't you?

25:48.966 --> 25:52.261
The moment they hear any of us,
the moment they sense us,

25:52.344 --> 25:54.513
the moment an alarm is given,
this is over.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.973
The only way to reach her alive

25:56.056 --> 25:58.433
is for there to be no guards left
by the time they know we're here.

25:58.517 --> 26:00.561
One man must do it, one at a time.

26:00.644 --> 26:03.313
I'll do it. I can get them all.

26:03.397 --> 26:06.692
I remember asking for your eyes, witch,
not your opinion.

26:07.109 --> 26:09.695
The future of the kingdom is at stake.

26:09.778 --> 26:12.197
I've relied upon you
as far as I'm willing.

26:12.281 --> 26:14.783
Unless, Maghra, you trust him.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.787
Forget I asked.

26:19.371 --> 26:23.292
Marshal a vanguard. Signals, no words.

26:23.792 --> 26:27.129
The next man to speak will be me,
when I'm ready to call you in.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.380
If you give no signal?

26:28.463 --> 26:30.132
Then I have failed, the queen is dead.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.550
You should burn everything to the ground

26:31.633 --> 26:34.553
and take the princess to Kanzua
and see her installed upon the throne.

26:34.636 --> 26:36.430
I haven't consented to that.

26:36.513 --> 26:38.932
If it comes down to that,
you won't have to.

26:39.016 --> 26:40.851
Is it going to come down to that?

26:40.934 --> 26:41.935
No.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.328
Cutter! Cutter! Come over here!

27:41.411 --> 27:42.412
Guards.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.415
There's an intruder! Someone's here!

27:46.291 --> 27:47.501
Up, bitch.

27:55.926 --> 27:57.678
My knife. My knife.

28:06.478 --> 28:10.983
You think I would tell her who I am
without having a plan? Huh?

28:29.001 --> 28:30.210
Majesty?

28:30.294 --> 28:31.670
The queen is here.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.675
Why doesn't she speak?

28:37.718 --> 28:39.636
I'm fucking tired.

28:41.096 --> 28:44.600
It's all right. You're safe now.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.448
How did this happen?

29:01.158 --> 29:02.492
How did they get you?

29:04.203 --> 29:05.495
I had to leave.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.124
Someone moved against you. Who was it?

29:11.001 --> 29:12.127
So many.

29:13.837 --> 29:18.467
You'll recover soon,
and we'll return to Kanzua.

29:19.801 --> 29:22.471
But first, a healer's coming.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.528
She's here.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.397
-Careful.
-Of course.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.421
Have we met?

31:01.361 --> 31:03.030
I'm sorry this happened to you.

31:07.201 --> 31:09.828
You shouldn't leave, Maghra.

31:16.168 --> 31:18.045
Not until you've heard the news.

31:20.923 --> 31:23.342
What news, Your Majesty?

31:25.802 --> 31:27.429
They all moved against me.

31:30.265 --> 31:32.267
Claimed the gods were on their side.

31:33.227 --> 31:37.564
And when they failed,
I was left with a choice:

31:40.234 --> 31:42.194
to let this heresy stand...

31:43.820 --> 31:45.989
or to answer with one of my own.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.201
What does that mean?

31:49.618 --> 31:51.620
You wish to return me to Kanzua?

31:53.997 --> 31:55.040
There is no Kanzua.

31:57.376 --> 32:02.673
For years, we held power based on
the whim of the machines beneath us.

32:03.674 --> 32:07.344
When they chose to work, we were adored.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.764
When they didn't, we weren't.

32:13.559 --> 32:17.437
I don't want to be queen
because the machines work.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.360
I want to be queen because I am.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.658
So now the story will be this:

32:33.370 --> 32:36.290
The gods took the dam.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.253
They destroyed it in a rage

32:42.045 --> 32:45.549
and took with it the true heretics.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.345
The weak, the selfish, the backward.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.100
But they left me.

32:56.935 --> 32:58.145
Only me.

33:01.315 --> 33:04.401
You destroyed it.

33:09.406 --> 33:12.326
Those soldiers out there...

33:14.203 --> 33:20.209
For 20 years, they've done your bidding
on the promise that one day,

33:20.292 --> 33:24.087
they will return to their homes,
their families.

33:25.923 --> 33:27.925
Through countless battles...

33:29.009 --> 33:32.471
and miseries and horrors,

33:33.305 --> 33:35.974
that was what sustained them.

33:36.058 --> 33:38.477
And you just took it all away.

33:40.062 --> 33:41.897
I did what needed to be done.

33:43.106 --> 33:44.858
I saved our dynasty.

33:46.610 --> 33:49.112
You think I'm gonna go out there

33:49.196 --> 33:54.993
and tell my men all their families
were killed to save your dynasty,

33:55.077 --> 33:58.372
and they'll just go
wherever I tell them from there?

33:59.540 --> 34:00.791
Your men?

34:02.084 --> 34:03.377
My men.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.596
And I think they will do as I tell them...

34:15.597 --> 34:17.516
because I am their queen.

34:22.728 --> 34:27.150
I think,
for the first time in a long time...

34:28.819 --> 34:31.071
that's something we should reconsider.

34:53.177 --> 34:54.636
Whoa, whoa.

34:54.719 --> 34:55.721
What?

34:56.221 --> 34:57.389
Why are we stopping?

34:57.890 --> 34:59.600
Something doesn't feel right.

35:00.809 --> 35:03.478
-What's ahead?
-It's a mountain pass.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.316
-Is there another way around?
-No, not that I can see.

35:08.275 --> 35:09.526
Paris.

35:09.610 --> 35:11.653
I sense conflicting things.

35:12.404 --> 35:13.697
I dream danger.

35:14.448 --> 35:16.658
But I'm not exactly sure
where the danger lies.

35:16.742 --> 35:18.702
Maybe because there is none.

35:18.785 --> 35:20.370
We'll find another way around.

35:20.954 --> 35:21.955
We'll lose days.

35:22.039 --> 35:24.374
-I said we find another way around.
-There is nothing here.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.293
Kofun, tell him there's nothing here.

35:26.376 --> 35:28.045
Dad, I don't see anything.

35:30.756 --> 35:32.382
-I'll go.
-Hey.

35:33.592 --> 35:35.928
Kofun, where is the God Flame in the sky?

35:36.011 --> 35:37.471
It's already passed behind the mountain.

35:37.554 --> 35:39.139
Why should the sun matter to you?

35:39.223 --> 35:41.642
It doesn't. I'm just trying to figure out

35:41.725 --> 35:44.645
how soon it will be dark
and you'll be completely useless.

35:44.728 --> 35:45.771
Baba.

36:25.561 --> 36:26.854
Sound traps.

36:33.986 --> 36:35.237
Point to them.

37:03.765 --> 37:04.766
Yeah.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.560
Go.

37:29.833 --> 37:31.460
Don't move.

37:33.420 --> 37:36.215
There's a bow and arrow. We need it.

37:42.513 --> 37:44.056
What are you doing?

37:48.393 --> 37:51.104
I can move in silence. You can't.

39:05.971 --> 39:08.182
-Haniwa, no!
-Cease fire!

39:12.227 --> 39:13.353
You are Haniwa?

39:13.896 --> 39:14.897
Yes.

39:17.441 --> 39:19.109
And you who shouted...

39:20.861 --> 39:21.904
what's your name?

39:23.405 --> 39:24.406
Kofun.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.366
Children of Jerlamarel,

39:27.034 --> 39:29.745
just beyond these trees there is a bridge.

39:31.038 --> 39:34.082
You may pass over that bridge
into the House of Enlightenment.

39:34.958 --> 39:38.587
Is there a healer
in the House of Enlightenment?

39:38.670 --> 39:40.339
You cannot pass.

39:40.422 --> 39:42.549
You just told us we could cross.

39:42.633 --> 39:46.595
Only the children of Jerlamarel may cross
into the House of Enlightenment.

39:47.387 --> 39:49.932
There is only one rule, and that is it.

39:50.349 --> 39:54.061
You tell Jerlamarel that we're here.
He'll understand.

39:55.270 --> 39:57.564
Only Kofun and Haniwa may cross.

39:57.648 --> 39:58.649
You listen to me--

39:58.732 --> 40:00.025
Boy.

40:01.276 --> 40:04.446
There is only one rule, and that is it.

40:05.781 --> 40:08.784
You can tell Jerlamarel why his son
and daughter came all this way

40:08.867 --> 40:10.077
just to turn back!

40:10.160 --> 40:11.662
We're not turning back.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.831
What are you talking about?
We have to turn back.

40:14.915 --> 40:17.417
-She needs a healer.
-No. She has Dad and Paris.

40:17.501 --> 40:19.002
He can take her to another tribe.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.546
What are you talking about?
We're not leaving her here, Haniwa.

40:20.629 --> 40:22.422
She doesn't need all of us.

40:22.506 --> 40:23.841
-We stay together.
-Kofun.

40:23.924 --> 40:25.008
-Enough.
-This is crazy.

40:25.092 --> 40:26.093
Enough.

40:26.176 --> 40:28.178
Listen to me. Listen to me.

40:30.806 --> 40:32.349
Haniwa, Kofun,

40:32.766 --> 40:37.020
we have traveled too far,
at too great a cost, to turn back now.

40:38.814 --> 40:41.191
I have thought about this
for a long while now.

40:41.775 --> 40:45.195
I never wanted to believe it,
but Paris is right.

40:46.613 --> 40:51.577
Every child eventually comes to a bridge
that they must cross alone.

40:51.660 --> 40:53.537
What are you talking about?

40:55.038 --> 40:58.584
The day you were born, I stood on a wall
fighting to protect you,

40:58.667 --> 41:00.669
and I have done it every day since.

41:01.962 --> 41:04.423
That's what a father does
to protect his children.

41:05.966 --> 41:09.887
But a father must also know
when it is time to let his children go

41:09.970 --> 41:11.972
so that they might find their own path.

41:15.017 --> 41:17.227
-That time is now.
-No, that's not true.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.231
That's not true.
Haniwa, tell him it's not true.

41:21.315 --> 41:22.774
It is true, Kofun.

41:23.442 --> 41:26.236
You and I live
in a different world than him.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.280
We always have.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.950
We'll never really understand each other.

41:32.451 --> 41:34.203
He brought us here knowing that.

41:34.286 --> 41:36.246
Why would you do that?

41:41.001 --> 41:42.669
Because I'm your father.

41:42.753 --> 41:44.087
Oh, Papa.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.006
My baby girl.

41:47.424 --> 41:48.634
You are wrong.

41:50.844 --> 41:52.471
We don't live in different worlds.

41:53.597 --> 41:55.182
You and your brother

41:55.265 --> 41:58.352
are the only world that I have lived in
since the day you were born.

42:00.062 --> 42:03.232
My children, I'm as blind as anyone.

42:05.275 --> 42:06.735
But I see you both.

42:08.153 --> 42:10.030
I will never stop seeing you.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.699
But I was right.

42:14.201 --> 42:16.995
This day had come,
and you must meet your father.

42:17.079 --> 42:18.830
Dad, you're my father.

42:26.421 --> 42:27.631
I love you, boy.

42:34.263 --> 42:35.889
We'll see you again?

42:40.102 --> 42:41.144
Yes.

42:44.439 --> 42:45.440
Bow Lion.

42:50.404 --> 42:52.865
This will be like a tickle for you.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.325
Yes.

42:57.369 --> 42:58.370
Good.

43:08.547 --> 43:09.882
Remember your mother always.

43:10.924 --> 43:12.843
Protect each other at all costs.

43:15.512 --> 43:18.098
-Dad.
-Kofun, no. Stop.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.933
He'll be alone.

43:21.476 --> 43:24.688
He will have Maghra with him always.

43:27.149 --> 43:30.360
And now, he will have the two of you.

43:32.779 --> 43:34.239
I will be with him.

43:37.951 --> 43:39.369
Look to your sister.

43:40.621 --> 43:41.955
She knows.

43:45.542 --> 43:46.543
Now...

43:48.003 --> 43:51.006
listen carefully, both of you.

43:52.257 --> 43:55.969
The gift of sight can be blinding.

43:58.347 --> 44:02.601
Jerlamarel... is your father,

44:03.644 --> 44:05.354
and he is sighted.

44:06.355 --> 44:10.025
But he is not a god, and neither are you.

44:12.194 --> 44:14.363
If you are to build this world...

44:16.657 --> 44:18.158
remember your mother.

44:19.243 --> 44:23.413
And remember Baba Voss,
who taught you all things.

44:23.497 --> 44:28.919
And you build this new world
for the sighted as well as the unsighted.

44:29.795 --> 44:32.714
With no gods! Do you understand?

44:33.715 --> 44:36.176
-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

44:36.260 --> 44:37.553
-Yes.
-Okay.

44:38.095 --> 44:39.346
Oh, my babies.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.977
Read the books for me.
Read the books for me.

44:50.190 --> 44:51.942
Young man.

44:55.445 --> 44:56.572
My staff.

45:00.409 --> 45:02.452
Okay, go. Go now.

45:02.536 --> 45:06.248
Go now before it's too dark
for you to see.

45:13.839 --> 45:15.883
I can't believe he really left us.

45:17.467 --> 45:19.469
We're the ones who left.

45:28.937 --> 45:29.938
Okay.

45:31.398 --> 45:33.483
We're coming now, the two of us.

45:34.193 --> 45:35.861
Haniwa and Kofun.

45:48.790 --> 45:50.834
You and me together, little brother.

45:54.338 --> 45:56.298
Always, little sister.

45:58.217 --> 45:59.343
Are you ready?

46:00.636 --> 46:01.678
No.

46:01.762 --> 46:03.013
Me neither.

46:08.435 --> 46:09.520
Let's go.

46:23.659 --> 46:25.285
You sent them alone.

46:27.746 --> 46:30.332
Sometimes the best way
to protect your children

46:30.415 --> 46:32.626
is to let them believe you've stopped.

46:34.002 --> 46:35.712
Did Maghra tell you that?

46:37.214 --> 46:38.423
Yes, she did.

46:40.926 --> 46:42.970
The only home I have is those children.

46:44.388 --> 46:45.848
I have nowhere else to be.

46:47.015 --> 46:48.100
Do you?

46:50.811 --> 46:52.229
So we stay close?

46:52.896 --> 46:53.981
Oh, yes.

46:55.148 --> 46:56.817
We stay close.

47:39.276 --> 47:40.402
What now?

47:41.904 --> 47:42.988
I don't know.

47:43.906 --> 47:45.449
I can't see anything.
