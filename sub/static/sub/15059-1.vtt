05:47.354 --> 05:50.355
What I do requires a certain mindset.

05:52.489 --> 05:54.005
I do assignments.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.107
Designated targets.

05:58.314 --> 06:01.389
Some jobs need to look like accidents.

06:03.140 --> 06:06.843
Others must cost suspision on someone else.

06:10.960 --> 06:14.574
I select few need to select a clear massage.

06:17.950 --> 06:19.696
Clean a trigger is easy.

06:21.830 --> 06:25.867

He went sprung for this scotch

07:03.653 --> 07:05.869
See ya, Henry.

07:31.115 --> 07:35.049
Why the fuck do I let you
drag me into this shithole?

07:35.165 --> 07:40.111
You're a snob Harry.
1,100 people come through here everyday.

07:40.313 --> 07:44.401
Aren't you remember two fellas passing through?

07:45.181 --> 07:47.542
Of course, people might remember them.

07:50.671 --> 07:55.044
All I got in the future purpose is this,
'cause I never go anywhere without a memory.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.284
Try to get here is some facts
they look like cartoons.

07:59.385 --> 08:01.480
Everything went okay?

08:02.314 --> 08:04.482
It got done.

08:05.974 --> 08:08.487
You know, I'm better than you, you know.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.704
That's why they give you those job.
They can't get a little Harry because...

08:12.087 --> 08:14.438
if they were a good Harrry,
then you would take care of it...

08:14.514 --> 08:18.214
and that's all they care about.
Services, rendered, no loose ends.

08:18.302 --> 08:22.686
Fait accompli.
You're a goddamn machine.

08:23.905 --> 08:26.841
You see things. If you people ...

08:26.958 --> 08:32.472
differently than I do differently than anybody does.
But you got a problem, Arthur.

08:32.514 --> 08:35.340
You do need companionship.
- I have you, Harry.

08:35.457 --> 08:38.623
Then, you in deeper shit
than I thought.

08:39.527 --> 08:40.864
So, how's Steven?

08:40.913 --> 08:44.483
Did I tell you i got him a job
at a private security firm?

08:44.965 --> 08:48.436
They kicked him out last month.
He hit some guy half  to death.

08:52.034 --> 08:56.704
Goddamn disappointment.
It always has been. It always will be.

08:58.446 --> 09:01.564
Call him.
- Me, call him?

09:01.661 --> 09:05.661
For what?
- He probably needs to hear from you.

09:08.165 --> 09:10.709
Let's go. I got your money.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.536
Come on. Dance with me.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.196

10:38.461 --> 10:40.251
Are you hungry?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.431
Sure.

10:57.838 --> 10:59.630
I gotta go.

11:15.812 --> 11:18.196
You ever gonna tell me your name?

11:22.905 --> 11:24.573
Arthur.

11:25.878 --> 11:28.857
Nice try.
But you are not Arthur.

11:29.294 --> 11:33.088
No. More like a...
David.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.390

12:22.220 --> 12:25.144
Global Engineering.
- I'm calling about the ad.

12:25.673 --> 12:28.591
There must be a mistake.
- One moment, please.

12:30.721 --> 12:33.910
The advertisement was proved.
The information is accurate.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.165
I want a meeting.

12:37.587 --> 12:39.828
We get back to you.

12:45.996 --> 12:48.337
Mr. Bishop, Mr. Dean has
agree to a meeting.

12:48.453 --> 12:52.326
Private jet will pick you up in one hour
to leave you to a neutral side of his choosing.

12:52.442 --> 12:56.361
You've been allowed fifteen minutes.
The jet will then return you.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.689
When we tell you to be home at 10 o'clock,
we mean 10, not 11.30.

13:00.894 --> 13:04.331
I don't care, baby. You scared your mother
to death. You're grounded for two weeks.

13:04.739 --> 13:06.325
Just one second.

13:08.745 --> 13:10.787
That's not my problem.

13:11.913 --> 13:15.530
All right, look. Ten days and you'll voluntere
two Saturdays at the shelter.

13:16.558 --> 13:18.425
Eight days and three Saturdays.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.883
Nice ring.
- Done.

13:20.917 --> 13:23.346
I wanna get one of those.
- You can't.

13:23.832 --> 13:26.834
Unless you are a world champion.
- Just tell me and I come and fix it.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.347
All right. Let's go.

13:33.030 --> 13:36.382
I just been out negotiate by a
sixteen years old.

13:37.221 --> 13:38.579
Let's take a walk.

13:42.877 --> 13:47.771
Six months ago, we were commission to under take
the largest contract you ever to attempted.

13:48.021 --> 13:51.436
The target was far more high profile
than we are normally comfortable with.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.453
The job was to reach a pass up.
- The target was South African?

13:55.569 --> 13:59.196
The target fled to South Africa.
There's where we made our move in Cape Town.

13:59.312 --> 14:01.410
Take six months to set up.

14:01.526 --> 14:05.248
I assign the team of five operatives
to work in a constrain on the mission.

14:05.364 --> 14:09.787
All five were killed.
Someone knew every detail.

14:09.881 --> 14:15.137
He probably knew someone from that team.
- I knew this one. Sebastian.

14:16.408 --> 14:18.869
You know how this company works, Mr. Bishop.

14:19.315 --> 14:22.513
Only two partners know
the details of any given job.

14:23.720 --> 14:28.297
Two people knew the details here.
Me and Harry McKenna.

14:29.238 --> 14:31.021
Harry sold us out.

14:34.259 --> 14:38.816
We pulled his financials. Take a look
at recent offshore deposits.

14:39.219 --> 14:42.754
There's one there on two weeks ago
twenty million US dollars

14:43.711 --> 14:46.122
He's gotten old.
He's gotten weak.

14:46.448 --> 14:50.429
He's loaded with debts, his divorce,
his cause and troubled son.

14:50.545 --> 14:52.343
They made him vulnerable.

14:52.433 --> 14:57.475
And for the past 13 years, I have been fiercely
loyal to him. There is no one I respected more.

14:57.900 --> 15:02.238
But Harry McKenna has poisoned the well.
He needs to be removed.

15:02.477 --> 15:05.349
Immediately.
- Let me talk to him.

15:05.850 --> 15:10.691
Look. I appreciate your connection with Harry,
but there is no turning back, here.

15:11.672 --> 15:14.277
He has cross his rubicon.

15:14.311 --> 15:18.005
Everyday that he's alive,
puts this company in danger.

15:19.136 --> 15:22.137
Now that we all prefer
that you handle this ...

15:22.254 --> 15:26.350
giving your relationship, you're in best
position to get this done quickly and discreetly.

15:26.864 --> 15:30.309
And to be honest with you, I hate the idea
of Harry suffer unnecessarily.

15:31.424 --> 15:35.308
We don't wanna go on the outside source.
But we will if we have to.

15:37.388 --> 15:38.899
Excuse me a sec.

15:41.784 --> 15:44.548
Jess, negotiations are closed, I'm sorry.

15:45.167 --> 15:48.466
I'm in a meeting.
Hang on a sec.

15:50.162 --> 15:53.720
48 hours or we'll proceed the options.

16:04.152 --> 16:09.059
Yeah. I mean, Roosevelt to be truthful is my hero.

16:09.523 --> 16:14.433
I meant the way he dealt with this.
Damn chair.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.896
Please, pull your trouser up.

16:17.105 --> 16:20.067
Those suits doesn't really fit you guys very well.

16:33.389 --> 16:37.816
TIP OFF FOILS ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
ALL FIVE SUSPECTS GUNNED DOWN

17:14.185 --> 17:17.419

- Get out of the building, Harry.

17:17.723 --> 17:20.661
Arthur?
- They coming for you tonight.

17:20.778 --> 17:23.664
Who is coming?
- Dean.

17:24.176 --> 17:28.157
Take whatever you can use against them
and get out.

17:28.273 --> 17:31.084
Do you have a pair of scissors?

17:34.585 --> 17:37.318
Go to the elevator lobby.
- On my way.

17:44.487 --> 17:46.711
Looks like we got a power out on the 18th floor.

17:46.748 --> 17:51.020
You have 15 seconds to get to the service elevator
before the emergency power comes on.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.218
Is there a clip here?
- Punching the building number.

17:53.260 --> 17:57.181
I thought we cut the power off?
- Service elevator had the work on a saparate password.

17:58.525 --> 17:59.687
I'm in.

18:00.181 --> 18:04.527
Press the basement floor.
The elevator will take 18 seconds to get there.

18:04.863 --> 18:08.449
The level is empty and unuse.
Take the ramp.

18:08.672 --> 18:13.262
Connects to the building next door.
Leads to an underground parking lot.

18:14.478 --> 18:15.801
Shit.

18:17.402 --> 18:21.640
The security cameras haven't be fitted
in this building yet. So, they will be blind.

18:27.990 --> 18:31.032
Okay, you should be
entering the parking lot.

18:42.073 --> 18:45.748
My van is here.
- I left it there.

18:46.472 --> 18:48.720
Oh, shit.

18:56.077 --> 18:59.934
You get me to circumvent
my own security.

19:01.510 --> 19:03.791
Nobody sees me leave.

19:06.231 --> 19:09.583
So, what's this?
Cape Town right?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.875
Right.

19:16.006 --> 19:18.194
So, what's the story here?

19:18.296 --> 19:19.872
Car jacking?

19:20.115 --> 19:24.473
Police will find my van somewhere
in shithole section of the city...

19:24.717 --> 19:27.439
stripped and up on blocks?

19:27.487 --> 19:29.193
Something like that.

19:31.950 --> 19:35.096
It's like, auditoriale a vision.

19:35.576 --> 19:37.100
You do not mind in?

19:40.466 --> 19:43.807

19:57.346 --> 20:01.229

C'iest la vie.

20:01.244 --> 20:04.444
At least I don't go down
looking like a pussy.

20:06.854 --> 20:09.386
I have that for 33 years.

20:10.946 --> 20:14.556
Gift from Admiral Beasly, sixth fleet.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.972
That is the first time
I ever fired it.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.320
Why didn't you kill me?

20:25.667 --> 20:27.833
They just send somebody else.

20:29.810 --> 20:32.766
I would rather it was you, Arthur.

20:34.515 --> 20:36.465
You have to live with it.

21:22.710 --> 21:25.741
McKENNA

21:37.205 --> 21:40.733
Arthur fucking Bishop.
- Sorry for your loss.

21:41.564 --> 21:44.182
More of a loss for you
than me, buddy.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.673
It's a long time.

22:09.899 --> 22:13.012
Hey, would you give me a ride to
my father's house?

22:20.769 --> 22:23.733
Your father, talked about you a lot.

22:24.118 --> 22:26.958
Talk about spending time with you.
Maybe, make it up.

22:27.132 --> 22:28.930
Give it a rest, will you.

22:29.263 --> 22:31.458
He always bringing you up.

22:32.348 --> 22:35.901
He had regrets stay with him.
- And I've could pick up the phone anytime.

22:50.763 --> 22:52.516
I want to show you something.

23:01.856 --> 23:04.890
I love this place as a kid.

23:11.411 --> 23:13.277
It's pretty impressive, huh?

23:15.127 --> 23:18.901
Everyone of them,
serve their country.

23:19.938 --> 23:22.459
I guess I could still, unless...

23:22.981 --> 23:24.732
you know, make them proud.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.178
I'm fucking with you.

23:28.697 --> 23:32.757
I don't know if you have a
picture of my father? Maybe...

23:33.028 --> 23:34.794
you want one.

23:44.969 --> 23:47.628
Just looking up plan on sticking around?

23:47.744 --> 23:51.356
For what?
He didn't leave a will.

23:51.373 --> 23:54.510
The accounts are empty.
Banks gonna take the house.

23:54.832 --> 23:59.950
By the time of the lawyers sitting a stake it
through with the rest not gonna be a fucking thing left.

24:00.066 --> 24:03.540
Where you headed?
- I had some place.

24:06.428 --> 24:09.706
Need some money?
- No, thanks.

24:11.195 --> 24:14.384
I got a guy come to the house.
He's gonna look at the car.

24:14.500 --> 24:17.560
I figure that I probably get a pay
throught on the next spot.

24:18.963 --> 24:20.537
What about the guns?

24:23.530 --> 24:28.389
I was thinking about going out and killing
myself a couple of car jackers tonight.

24:30.399 --> 24:33.446
Just any all around the world car jack, huh?

24:33.563 --> 24:37.282
Yeah, you never know I might get
lucky find the guys that kill my dad.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.925
That'll make you feel better?

24:41.580 --> 24:43.367
Fuck if I know.

24:44.322 --> 24:45.832
I'll find out.

24:56.065 --> 24:58.291
Save it up, Steve.

25:02.473 --> 25:04.314
Hey, Bishop...

25:05.481 --> 25:09.556
what kind of person shoot someone
in a wheelchair, anyway?

26:06.564 --> 26:08.444
Yo...

26:12.128 --> 26:14.432
Hey, you need some help?

26:17.810 --> 26:20.163
No, I think I got it.

26:21.506 --> 26:25.448
I suppose to meet a friend and
I might of get the address wrong.

26:25.796 --> 26:27.711
Yeah, maybe.

26:27.827 --> 26:31.653
But maybe the address got me wrong.

26:33.562 --> 26:36.703
Nice car, man. Nice car.
- Thanks.

26:38.506 --> 26:41.357
Can I have it?

26:41.473 --> 26:45.722
I'm releaving you of your
automobil, motherfucker. Out of the car.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.906
Seriously?
- Seriously.

26:50.228 --> 26:53.509

26:59.874 --> 27:01.716
Car jacker.

27:04.835 --> 27:06.768
You shoot him with this?

27:07.872 --> 27:09.822
Is this the gun you used?

27:10.998 --> 27:12.126
No?

27:44.007 --> 27:45.785
Hey, bad move.

27:47.619 --> 27:50.200
Hope you think this through did you Steve, eh?

27:53.006 --> 27:56.285
Its may not seem like it tonight your lucky night...

27:56.336 --> 27:58.206

Or we just looking for you .

28:04.327 --> 28:06.026
Get out of here.

28:08.993 --> 28:11.478
Stupid to kill someone
if you have a motive.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.838
Might as well paint a
bulls eye on your back.

28:14.278 --> 28:17.349
I don't give a shit.
- I'm aware.

28:19.964 --> 28:21.198
Get out of here.

28:30.378 --> 28:32.209
Fuck.

29:12.107 --> 29:15.970
I was thinking about what
were you saying the other night.

29:16.848 --> 29:18.576
And uh...I wanna know what you know.

29:19.363 --> 29:23.092
Go online.
It's all on the Internet.

29:23.908 --> 29:27.576
But, I don't wanna read it.
I wanna do it.

29:28.436 --> 29:31.993
Do what exactly?
- Bishop, don't bullshit me.

29:32.109 --> 29:35.161
I know about you.
And him.

29:35.671 --> 29:39.895
He was your mentor. He chose you over me.
You owe him.

29:40.688 --> 29:44.300
Now that he's gone, he left me with
fucking nothing, you owe me now.

29:45.359 --> 29:47.572
Go home, Steve.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.353
Still for sale.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.932
I know you want it.
No other lifetime for this.

30:20.303 --> 30:24.782
Want some advice?
Find out what this tells you.

30:25.592 --> 30:28.431
He's try to tell you something.

30:28.496 --> 30:32.392
He's telling you;
you homesick for a place you never been.

31:03.951 --> 31:07.261
8600 Elborano Street.
7 A.M tomorrow.

31:23.206 --> 31:25.612
What is this place?
- It's an animal shelter.

31:25.673 --> 31:28.938
Yeah, I know what this is. Why are we here?
- I look for a dog like this.

31:28.994 --> 31:32.610
Under a year if possible.
- I think you more for a cat person.

31:36.122 --> 31:39.742
You know what a Mechanic is,
aside of its obvious definition?

31:39.921 --> 31:43.786
A guy who fix his things,
problems, its contracts.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.213
A hitman.
- I do assignments.

31:47.682 --> 31:50.542
Designated targets.
- I can do that.

31:50.975 --> 31:53.373
I've seen some shit.
- No, you haven't.

31:55.048 --> 31:57.904
You know shit about me, Bishop.

31:58.196 --> 32:01.180
Steven Jackson McKenna.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland.

32:01.238 --> 32:04.439
Your mother died when you was 12.
When she was in pain medicine and vodka.

32:04.555 --> 32:07.931
You attended 3 different high schools
Grunt, The Parc and Munro.

32:08.047 --> 32:10.202
Natural in four sports,
got a scholarship from Miami ...

32:10.259 --> 32:13.886
that was rescinded upon a conviction of
possession within an attempt to distribute.

32:14.126 --> 32:18.287
And four misdemeanor for aggrevated assault on
local treads against two different girlfriends.

32:18.404 --> 32:22.293
Broke your kneecap in a streetfight.
Didn't wanna tell anyone so you lie a tale on its own.

32:22.648 --> 32:25.846
Only range went over the length.
I show the X-rays if you like.

32:31.528 --> 32:34.632
A friend there would like to adopt
this little fella.

32:36.925 --> 32:38.995
Hey, boy.

32:48.371 --> 32:50.853
What I do requires
a certain mindset.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.748
Revenge is an emotion that
can get you killed.

32:53.802 --> 32:56.713
So, no more stupid stuffs
like the other night.

33:02.187 --> 33:04.785
Walk it, feel it, make it your best friend.

33:04.901 --> 33:07.385
Tomorrow, eleven, Fisher Square.

33:21.785 --> 33:24.300
Take the dog to the coffee shop
in Riverdale.

33:24.725 --> 33:26.897
Order a coffee.
Black.

33:27.273 --> 33:30.494
Sit at the table by the window,
and do the sudoku puzzle in the paper.

33:30.611 --> 33:32.805
Play nice with the dog.
- For how long?

33:33.082 --> 33:34.492
One hour.

33:34.964 --> 33:37.503
Every day, for the next three weeks.

33:59.844 --> 34:02.482
This is yours.

34:16.330 --> 34:19.116
Practice some of this.

34:19.492 --> 34:22.484
Insurance companies know
everything about how people die.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.428
They have books with actuaries.

34:24.543 --> 34:27.324
List of every cause of death imaginable.

34:27.656 --> 34:29.871
Why did you show to me all of the fuck of this?

34:29.987 --> 34:33.993
Good judgement comes from experience
and all of that comes from bad judgment.

34:50.712 --> 34:54.550
Beds under the boxes.
Help yourself.

35:20.723 --> 35:22.616
How long you've been working on it?

35:24.949 --> 35:28.710
Two years.
- It's nice.

35:29.547 --> 35:34.140
When are we gonna go for a ride?
- We? Never.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.934
Time to take your training
to the next level.

35:59.632 --> 36:01.882
Who is that?
- He's good.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.012
I only checked you out.

36:04.862 --> 36:08.310
I can come back.
Rather than stand out here.

36:17.953 --> 36:20.862
I gotta tell you man.
I'm skittish right now.

36:20.979 --> 36:23.710
I'm not sure if this a good time
for me to be doing anything.

36:24.989 --> 36:27.203
There a lot of shit wind, you know.

36:28.790 --> 36:30.526
I brought the list and the money.

36:32.335 --> 36:34.173
Now is not the good time.

36:35.630 --> 36:37.782
Let me see the list.

36:42.404 --> 36:45.210
All this been when?
- As soon as possible.

36:45.662 --> 36:49.331
All right.
Take me day to make it happen.

36:50.302 --> 36:52.730
Give me out the money.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.608
Auto Erotic is fixation?
- Yup.

37:37.450 --> 37:40.066
I just thought you should
see one up close.

38:02.592 --> 38:04.735
Don't ever touch this.

38:23.324 --> 38:25.519
Follow me.

38:34.957 --> 38:39.190
Who was he?
- A job. Nothing more, nothing less.

38:39.525 --> 38:42.269
Make you feel better, he was
an illegal arms dealer.

38:43.007 --> 38:44.680
Sold weapons to anyone.

38:44.951 --> 38:48.077
Cop killers, gangbangers,
terrorists.

38:48.385 --> 38:50.223
He didn't discriminate.

39:00.658 --> 39:02.924
Here's the file.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.622
The guy from the coffee shop?

39:08.443 --> 39:10.471
All yours.

39:10.768 --> 39:14.574
You wouldn't know by looking at him.
But he's a Mechanic for another group.

39:15.594 --> 39:18.604
His only routine is coffee
every morning from nine to ten.

39:18.659 --> 39:20.852
He isn't going any place twice, except here.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.546
He's isolated and protected.

39:24.761 --> 39:28.674
No way in without him seing it's coming.
Except he has two weaknesses.

39:28.707 --> 39:30.816
Chihuahuas.
- Mind if I sit down?

39:30.916 --> 39:32.666
Please.
- And boys.

39:33.055 --> 39:35.732
Young boys.
- Coffee, black.

39:35.848 --> 39:39.678
Although he checked you out for the past six weeks
and found no connection to you in his world.

39:39.795 --> 39:42.573
All he sees is a good
looking kid who's kind of lost.

39:42.599 --> 39:44.951
Mind if I hold him?
- Yeah.

39:45.028 --> 39:47.539
He likes that.
- Come here, baby.

39:47.634 --> 39:51.040
If he's interested,
first thing he'll do is ask you...

39:51.262 --> 39:52.517
Do you live around here, Steve?

39:52.577 --> 39:55.309
Your answer should be.
- well, I'm bouncing around.

39:55.555 --> 39:57.752
Which means you're broke
and open to suggestions.

39:57.868 --> 40:00.004
With my buddy.

40:00.057 --> 40:03.068
Then asks you if...
- You want to get a drink later on with me?

40:03.111 --> 40:05.147
Your answer should be.
- Yeah.

40:06.792 --> 40:09.171
Great. That's great ain't it?

40:09.679 --> 40:12.922
This one is Trazepam.
- Groovy.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.292
You want me to kill him not rape him, right?

40:19.789 --> 40:21.586
Two to three drops, he's woozy.

40:21.996 --> 40:26.224
Over six, somehow stops in his brain
dead in under than 20 minutes.

40:27.078 --> 40:29.661
Do it in the bar.
Make it clean.

40:35.663 --> 40:38.747
All these fancy places there
are always watered down it...

40:38.864 --> 40:41.601
so I think that's why you
are going down so fast.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.827
They don't watery down in one.
- It's really good.

40:46.016 --> 40:47.471
You want more?
- Yeah.

40:47.587 --> 40:49.978
Jameson, right?
- Jamesons double, please.

40:59.360 --> 41:02.829
Don't mess around with this guy.
Do it in the bar, make it clean.

41:05.767 --> 41:09.073
I wanna know what you know.
I wanna do it.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.625
What?
What's funny?

41:23.742 --> 41:28.056
Nothing. No..I just..I think I had to many.
- No, come on.

41:28.172 --> 41:32.091
No..I think i'm gonna finish
this one and i'm gonna...

41:34.734 --> 41:38.467
I really should go to bed..
But this is very..it's funny.

41:47.164 --> 41:48.187
Steve.

41:50.834 --> 41:51.627
Hey...

41:52.525 --> 41:53.285
You all right?

41:53.578 --> 41:56.598
Yeah, how are you?
- I'm good, man.

41:57.711 --> 42:01.363
Hey, can I give you a ride someplace?
Car is right here.

42:02.369 --> 42:05.120
Come on. Get in.
I want to show you something.

42:05.565 --> 42:08.549
Yeah?
- He's six foot seven, 300 pounds and lethal.

42:08.845 --> 42:10.857
Do not take this guy up.

42:10.866 --> 42:14.132
Whatever you do,
don't ever get into his car.

42:30.142 --> 42:31.430
What do you think?

42:32.709 --> 42:35.767
It's beautiful.
- Let me get you a drink.

42:40.553 --> 42:43.847
Do you paint?
- Yeah, It's more of a hobby really.

42:44.108 --> 42:46.892
Pretty serious hobby.

42:49.742 --> 42:51.661
Cheers.

42:52.448 --> 42:54.640
That's the sitting area and fireplace.

42:54.757 --> 42:59.632
Chillaxing room.
- This is the place I most proud of, right here.

43:00.702 --> 43:05.235
This is good.
- That is, 14th-century Buddha.

43:05.670 --> 43:09.488
And that was a bitch
to get into this country.

43:09.604 --> 43:13.579
It's nice to have friends.
Have a good friends who make a difference.

43:16.449 --> 43:18.740
Do you got good friends?

43:21.569 --> 43:24.098
I mean, really good friends.

43:27.551 --> 43:29.187
You're shaking like a leaf.

43:29.526 --> 43:30.786
Sit down.

43:47.695 --> 43:50.015
All right...all right

43:51.809 --> 43:54.112
Slow down, cowboy.

46:29.272 --> 46:31.714
I tell you to make it clean.

47:20.230 --> 47:22.337
See you later.

47:42.121 --> 47:44.838
Was it work or a pleasure?

47:48.428 --> 47:51.588
I wish someone would hurt me like that.

48:37.379 --> 48:38.509
Hey..

48:39.395 --> 48:43.391
Thank's. I'm gonna call him Arthur.

49:24.495 --> 49:26.529
PRESS # 1

49:29.700 --> 49:30.890
Yeah..

49:31.206 --> 49:34.863
You use an outside individual
to complete your assignment.

49:35.225 --> 49:37.322
That's a violation of our arrangement.

49:37.439 --> 49:41.348
My arrangement was with Harry.
You and I don't have one.

49:41.572 --> 49:43.424
Just the price.

49:45.561 --> 49:48.483
I think someone try to
blame me would be viable to you.

49:48.484 --> 49:50.244
Harry McKenna's son?

49:50.867 --> 49:52.662
Is he know you killed his father?

49:55.485 --> 49:59.734
This job needs to be done immediately.
Clients want to pay premium for it.

50:00.068 --> 50:02.311
I don't think so. It's too quick.

50:02.427 --> 50:06.467
Your behaviour is making me
and the others extremely uneasy.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.323
You're on a short leash with this one.

50:09.746 --> 50:13.061
The file is a priority.

50:16.762 --> 50:18.893
I'll look it up.

50:47.043 --> 50:51.779
I am one with God.
God touches me and I touch his people.

50:51.896 --> 50:56.635
Andrew Vaughn, 45 years old.
Calls himself the new Messiah.

50:56.690 --> 50:58.980
Reverend Vaughn.
- Just Vaughn.

50:59.424 --> 51:02.298
I'm not a reverend. I'm not endorsed
by the end of the world religion.

51:02.414 --> 51:04.436
I'm above them, I am Vaughn.

51:04.552 --> 51:08.208
He has made millions of dollars
to his churches, his ministries...

51:08.325 --> 51:12.125
television program,
basically, he is running a cult.

51:12.241 --> 51:15.550
Adrenaline shot to the heart,
12 cc and he's dead under three minutes.

51:15.666 --> 51:19.022
Adrenaline's unreliable.
Went him for survive a cardiac arrest.

51:19.138 --> 51:24.057
When EMT is arrive, first thing they do
is jammed you with the shot of epinephrine.

51:24.173 --> 51:26.749
Which is toxic when combined with.
- Adrenaline.

51:26.789 --> 51:29.508
So, any of the chance of adrenaline shot doesn't kill him?

51:29.624 --> 51:31.346
The EMT's will.

51:31.599 --> 51:34.279
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

51:36.551 --> 51:39.927
He left a Bible study group
for the young devotee, one night.

51:40.471 --> 51:43.855
They won't found her body
until two weeks later.

51:46.292 --> 51:50.473
The autopsy said she had an abortion.
She was telling her friends that it was his.

51:50.528 --> 51:53.482
Cost him 22 million dollars
to quash it up.

51:54.358 --> 51:56.372
Okay, let's get this over with.

52:00.164 --> 52:02.783
Bless you, next.

52:02.817 --> 52:05.868
Would you come sit right here.

52:07.652 --> 52:09.753
You're new here aren't you?
How long have you been here?

52:09.859 --> 52:10.619
Two weeks, sir.

52:10.758 --> 52:13.160
How old are you?
- 18.

52:13.195 --> 52:15.054
18.

52:43.388 --> 52:46.168
You could've found someone
more attractive to spy out.

52:46.955 --> 52:48.593
He still eating.

52:48.955 --> 52:52.769
Soup, salad, sandwich...
double chocolate cake.

52:53.987 --> 52:56.472
Bishop, I'm hungry.

52:58.317 --> 53:03.309
The guy at the delly, he had
bandage on all of his fingers.

53:03.985 --> 53:06.916
If you find a bandage in your sanwich,
it wouldn't be mine.

53:50.681 --> 53:52.564
We're all clear.

54:11.854 --> 54:14.702
How do you feel, Vaughn?
- How do you think I feel?

54:14.818 --> 54:17.011
He should be here any minute.

54:18.043 --> 54:20.665
Speak of the devil.

54:35.215 --> 54:39.165
Give me something special today.
I feel like celebrating.

54:42.552 --> 54:44.452
I have a spirit work to do.

54:59.350 --> 55:03.763
The guys are junkie.
- He's giving him a ketamine.

55:04.524 --> 55:05.524
So?

55:05.245 --> 55:09.032
Ketamine counteracts adrenaline.
This won't work now.

55:20.745 --> 55:25.605
I have been tap on the shoulder...by God.

55:25.926 --> 55:28.344
What do you want to do?

55:29.513 --> 55:31.395
I have been asked...

55:31.512 --> 55:36.034
my shoulder was touched by
the sword of the king.

55:36.151 --> 55:40.942
He told me to rise...

55:42.094 --> 55:44.026
We gotta pack it up.

55:44.107 --> 55:47.326
Wait, wait.
- If he comes back in here.

55:47.748 --> 55:49.773
Puts your gloves on.

55:51.203 --> 55:54.630
Yes, hello?
Yes, yes it is.

55:57.051 --> 55:58.998
Hey...
- Let's go.

55:59.221 --> 56:03.348
We would have done this right.
Down his throat. He needs to choked.

56:07.231 --> 56:12.732
If they think that I'm going to pay full price
for a four bedroom in this market, they crazy.

56:16.967 --> 56:19.668
How can I change the world?

56:19.785 --> 56:24.758
How can I be a better man
for my...

56:24.875 --> 56:28.978
Let's go.
- Sometimes I wonder.

56:30.609 --> 56:35.965
Sometimes I...
...the strength, the courage.

56:37.150 --> 56:41.948
I look at myself in the mirror
and think...

56:44.900 --> 56:46.265
Crist.

56:47.595 --> 56:49.321
Ralph, get in here.

56:49.550 --> 56:52.440
What is it?
- What is it?

56:54.034 --> 56:56.229
Is he dead?
- Yeah.

56:56.345 --> 56:58.289
Stupid motherfucker.
I knew this gonna happen.

56:58.345 --> 57:01.833
Get all this shit round up, get out
the fuck out of here, as fast as you can.

57:13.718 --> 57:15.954
Try and pick him up.

57:20.150 --> 57:20.900
Fuck!

57:36.263 --> 57:38.951
Go check it out.

57:56.895 --> 57:59.350
Take it off the wall.

58:01.919 --> 58:04.538
Hey, on the wall.

58:09.056 --> 58:11.235
Follow him.

58:11.397 --> 58:14.482
Cover the exit and give me
two guys on the roof, now.

58:33.769 --> 58:36.440
There he is.

01:00:12.747 --> 01:00:15.721
<i>Stay calm.</i>

01:00:17.632 --> 01:00:19.182
They are looking for two men.

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:22.690
There a connecting flight out of Midwell.
I fly from O'Hara and meet you at house tomorrow.

01:00:24.218 --> 01:00:27.183
<i>Right this way. Let's go.</i>

01:00:33.146 --> 01:00:36.705
Andrew Vaughn, the controversial
and polarizing religious figure...

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:38.442
has been pronounce dead.

01:00:38.477 --> 01:00:44.649
Police are still investigating the shooting that
occur short there after the perpetrators has not been found.

01:01:06.755 --> 01:01:10.537
All five are killed.

01:01:10.815 --> 01:01:13.448
You probably knew some of the man on that team.

01:01:28.389 --> 01:01:32.769
Terminal B.
- Next bus, down on the street leaves in 15 minutes.

01:01:32.701 --> 01:01:33.601
Thanks.

01:01:56.723 --> 01:01:59.521
When does this leaves?
- In 15 minutes.

01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:05.020
That gives us much time then.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:11.652
What do you want?

01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:16.209
I wonder what you doing alive.

01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:19.736
Last time I saw you,
you had a bullet in your head.

01:02:20.432 --> 01:02:23.758
What really happened in Cape Town?

01:02:24.076 --> 01:02:26.992
Where's the rest of your team?
- They're dead.

01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:30.257
Who paid you? Was it Harry or Dean.

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:33.939
Dean paid me a very large
amount of money to kill the others.

01:02:34.344 --> 01:02:36.326
Tell me to fake my death,
dissappear.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.104
You know what else he told me?

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:42.040
That Harry was getting suspicious
about a blown operations.

01:02:41.572 --> 01:02:46.351
He's about to blow the wistle.
It had to be taken care of.

01:02:47.431 --> 01:02:50.495
Did you just the man for the job?

01:02:50.929 --> 01:02:53.438
Someone who could get Dean.

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:57.135
It's not the fact that you
killed him, is it?

01:02:57.643 --> 01:03:01.915
It's that they played you easily. That's what bothers you.

01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:05.022
Am I right?

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:37.833
Well?
- Not so good for your side.

01:05:38.252 --> 01:05:42.277
Those were two my best teams.
I guess I had to send more.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.139
Save the fuel.
I'm coming for you.

01:05:53.293 --> 01:05:54.969
When are you gonna be home?

01:05:55.192 --> 01:05:57.167
I'm really hungry.
- Where are you?

01:05:57.919 --> 01:06:00.168
I'm in the living room.

01:06:00.525 --> 01:06:03.020
Sit down on the couch.
- Okay.

01:06:03.544 --> 01:06:05.765
I guess you are not alone.

01:06:06.903 --> 01:06:08.808
There is a gun under the left-side cushion.

01:06:08.988 --> 01:06:11.231
It's loaded and the safety's off.

01:06:11.539 --> 01:06:14.920
But I'm not a lefty.
- Then you gonna die.

01:06:16.433 --> 01:06:19.155
All right, I see you when you get here.

01:06:28.358 --> 01:06:30.860
I'll be there in five.

01:06:40.858 --> 01:06:43.858
Who sent those guys?
- The man who employs me.

01:06:45.284 --> 01:06:48.753
Grab all the gear on the top shelf
and put it in the boat.

01:07:39.462 --> 01:07:41.868
Are we set?

01:07:46.009 --> 01:07:48.203
Get in the boat.

01:08:05.823 --> 01:08:08.533
Do you ever think about the
people you've killed?

01:08:11.409 --> 01:08:13.513
No.

01:08:13.933 --> 01:08:17.216
Have you ever killed someone you know?

01:08:22.245 --> 01:08:24.090
Yes.

01:08:25.971 --> 01:08:28.638
Did it feel any different?

01:08:31.752 --> 01:08:34.170
Not in the moment.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.600
After...

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:45.407
Any kind of warning?
Time to prepare?

01:08:45.827 --> 01:08:48.993
Kind of time to ...

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.499
make peace.

01:08:55.876 --> 01:08:57.956
There's no peace.

01:09:01.624 --> 01:09:04.895
So, it's best not to let them know when you're coming.

01:09:11.616 --> 01:09:13.654
Yes.

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:18.269
I guess it doesn't really matter anyway,
as long as they're dead and you not, right?

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:43.687
Hello, Finch.

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:54.850
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

01:10:02.429 --> 01:10:05.080
You just listen to me closely.

01:10:05.236 --> 01:10:09.133
I don't care who I hurt
or who I killed, understand?

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:19.108
Please, no, no, no.

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:22.492
You're gonna tell me exactly that I came for to find out.

01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:25.246
Where's Dean?

01:10:38.045 --> 01:10:43.622
It's up to you how far I go.

01:10:45.801 --> 01:10:48.169
Wrist?

01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:53.230
Elbow?
- Please, just tell him what he wants to know.

01:11:01.688 --> 01:11:04.336
Okay, okay...300, Carbon Plaza.

01:11:05.455 --> 01:11:08.219
300, Carbon Plaza.
That's where he is. I swear.

01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:19.580
Look's like you going to miss a good dinner.

01:11:21.674 --> 01:11:24.425
I got you, bastard.

01:11:35.245 --> 01:11:39.035
Yes.
- How much was Harry's life worth?

01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:43.549
50 million.

01:11:44.377 --> 01:11:46.052
And here's what I'm gonna do.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:51.341
10 million wired to a bank of your choice,
within 24 hours.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:55.325
It's a good deal, you should take it.
- Not interested.

01:11:56.058 --> 01:11:58.935
**

01:11:59.102 --> 01:12:01.811
I do that as a breach of professional ethic,
Mr. Bishop.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:05.637
Harry's death is business.
Pure and simple.

01:12:05.898 --> 01:12:08.389
It's not gonna be so simple now.

01:12:09.035 --> 01:12:13.160
You get that right. Cause now i'm gonna 
put a price on your head. It's so big...

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:18.754
when you look in the mirror,
your reflection are gonna shoot you in the face.

01:12:18.859 --> 01:12:22.208
You won't survive that long.
- You're a fool.

01:12:22.386 --> 01:12:24.822
You think you can get to me 
before I get to you?

01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:27.084
I already have.

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:34.670
Where's conference room, E?
- Floor upstairs, sir.

01:12:34.787 --> 01:12:37.032
He's in the building. Get me the fuck out of here.

01:13:32.098 --> 01:13:35.347
They find Bishop?
- Nothing yet.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.871
Get out the fucking bus.
Move, out the fucking bus. Move!

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:10.522
Go.

01:14:45.686 --> 01:14:48.486
Move back up. Come on. 
Let's go. 

01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:38.093
Fuck you.

01:16:05.415 --> 01:16:07.689
What's the plan, now?

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.358
Disappear.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:14.662
New names, occupation.
- Together?

01:16:16.717 --> 01:16:19.160
That's up to you.

01:16:19.505 --> 01:16:20.415
What'd gonna you do?

01:16:29.591 --> 01:16:32.047
Want a water?

01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:45.348
I've always had this...

01:16:47.428 --> 01:16:52.120
anger inside.
Now I feel like I have a...

01:16:52.427 --> 01:16:56.934
a place to put it.
I think I would miss this. I had stop now.

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:05.497
I had got always 
a business for myself and...

01:17:05.658 --> 01:17:08.369
A lot of people out there 
who would pay ...

01:17:09.773 --> 01:17:12.490
and I think you were wrong.

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:16.951
 Vengeance is the mission.

01:17:35.622 --> 01:17:39.377
You want anything?
- No.

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:59.234
Last chance.

01:17:59.829 --> 01:18:02.703
I'm good.

01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:04.292
Steve.

01:18:07.513 --> 01:18:10.462
Sorry for everything that happened.

01:18:11.483 --> 01:18:15.942
You know me, man. 
I don't give a shit.

01:21:10.191 --> 01:21:14.797
STEVE, IF YOU READ THIS,
THEN YOU'RE DEAD! BISHOP.

01:21:44.757 --> 01:21:47.907
VICTORY LOVES PREPARATION

01:21:52.382 --> 01:21:55.229
Watch number two.

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:34.110
- The End-
