WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:02.273
HELLO? HELLO?

00:02.273 --> 00:04.635
NOT NOW, TOM.
CAN'T REALLY TALK.

00:04.635 --> 00:06.537
I'VE GOT A FAMILY DINNER
TONIGHT.

00:06.537 --> 00:08.739
(grunts) YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU HAD KIDS.

00:08.739 --> 00:11.512
MY SON BRYCE IS A MARINE,
AND HAYLEE'S IN LAW SCHOOL.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.385
WE'VE BEEN NEIGHBORS FOR
12 YEARS. DO YOU EVEN KNOW ME?

00:14.385 --> 00:15.646
YOU KNOW,

00:15.646 --> 00:17.088
THIS CONVERSATION ISN'T
REALLY GONNA GO WELL FOR ME,

00:17.088 --> 00:18.689
SO I'M JUST GONNA GIVE YOU
A BLANKET "SORRY,"

00:18.689 --> 00:21.422
BUT PLEASE THANK BRYAN
FOR HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.753
BRYCE.
BRYCE.

00:26.697 --> 00:29.130
AH, IT'S NICE TO SEE
YOU TWO BONDING.

00:29.130 --> 00:32.263
(sighs) I WANTED THIS
TO BE A NICE FAMILY DINNER.

00:32.263 --> 00:33.534
NO ONE COULD SET THE TABLE?

00:33.534 --> 00:36.207
WE SHOULD JUST EAT CAVEMAN
STYLE. NO DISHES TO CLEAN.

00:36.207 --> 00:38.069
GET THE SHADES.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.373
(grunts)

00:42.373 --> 00:44.775
HO, HO, HO, HO, HO.
GIVE ME SOME OF THAT.

00:44.775 --> 00:47.148
DID YOU AT LEAST
WASH YOUR HANDS?

00:47.148 --> 00:48.749
(British accent)
OH, THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND

00:48.749 --> 00:50.421
WANTS TO KNOW
IF OUR HANDS ARE CLEAN.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.283
SHUT YOUR FACE.
(normal voice, mouth full)
YOU SHUT YOUR FACE.

00:52.283 --> 01:01.061
NOW IT'S A FAMILY DINNER.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.364
COME ON, DIG IN, PRISSY PANTS.
I'M ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.065
ELLIE AND LAURIE
ARE COMING OVER

01:05.065 --> 01:07.198
TO WORK ON OUR GUEST LIST
FOR OUR WEDDING. (blows kiss)

01:07.198 --> 01:08.499
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
HANG OUT TONIGHT.

01:08.499 --> 01:09.840
I MEAN,
EVER SINCE WE GOT ENGAGED,

01:09.840 --> 01:11.702
YOU'RE SO BUSY
WITH WEDDING STUFF.

01:11.702 --> 01:12.743
YOU WANT TO HELP OUT A LITTLE?

01:12.743 --> 01:14.845
PASS THE POTATOES?

01:14.845 --> 01:18.078
AH, ATTABOY. GRAVY CHASER?

01:18.078 --> 01:19.079
MM.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.481
MM. OH, YEAH.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.453
OH, TRAV, HONEY,
YOU LOOK SO TIRED.

01:22.453 --> 01:24.215
IF YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE
BACK TO SCHOOL TONIGHT,

01:24.215 --> 01:25.816
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DRINK A LOT OF CAFFEINE.

01:25.816 --> 01:28.259
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME SLEEPING
PILLS TO BRING YOU DOWN.

01:28.259 --> 01:31.222
WELL, AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE
THE INCREDIBLY UNHEALTHY ADVICE,

01:31.222 --> 01:33.794
I'M ALMOST 20.
DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.496
OH, OKAY. I'LL STOP.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.369
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
GETTING MARRIED TO ROYALTY.

01:38.369 --> 01:41.232
YOU SHOULD JUST BE
ALL WEDDING, ALL THE TIME.

01:41.232 --> 01:44.635
ALL WEDDING, ALL THE TIME--
I LIKE IT, YEAH.

01:44.635 --> 01:46.377
(grunts)

01:47.608 --> 01:51.782
(grunting)

01:51.782 --> 01:53.844
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

01:53.844 --> 01:56.417
I WOULD TOTALLY DATE
A GUY WITH NO FEET.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.520
IT WOULD JUST BE ONE LESS
GROSS THING FOR ME TO DEAL WITH.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.352
ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
I SHOULDN'T WEAR FLIP-FLOPS?

02:01.352 --> 02:03.894
NO. (gasps) OH, GOD, YES.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.298
THEY'RE ALL BIG TOES.

02:07.298 --> 02:10.361
WHOO!
YOU GOT DOMINATED, BUDDY!

02:10.361 --> 02:12.833
(Bobby and Andy laugh)

02:12.833 --> 02:15.266
THIS IS JUST OUR NEW GAME.
YOU KNOW,

02:15.266 --> 02:17.168
IF SOMEONE'S NOT LOOKING,
YOU PEG 'EM WITH THIS BALL,

02:17.168 --> 02:20.511
THUS ESTABLISHING DOMINANCE.
WE CALL IT DOMINANCE BALL.

02:20.511 --> 02:25.376
IF ANYONE HITS ME WITH A BALL,
IT WILL END UP INSIDE OF THEM.

02:25.376 --> 02:27.778
DON'T WORRY.
D-BALL'S JUST FOR DUDES.

02:27.778 --> 02:29.280
NOTHING'S JUST
FOR DUDES ANYMORE--

02:29.280 --> 02:32.583
NOT NASCAR, NOT CIGARS,
NOT EVEN PEEING STANDING UP.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.855
HOW DID WE LOSE THAT?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.727
MM-MM.

02:37.788 --> 02:40.160
WHY ARE YOU GUYS IN MY HOUSE?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.393
SORRY, JULES IS OUT OF WINE.
OH, AND PICKLES.

02:42.393 --> 02:45.336
OH, AND D BATTERIES
FOR MY BOOM BOX.

02:45.336 --> 02:48.939
ELLIE...
I SAW ANDY'S FEET.

02:48.939 --> 02:50.901
I'M SO SORRY.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.703
NO ONE UNDERSTANDS.

02:52.703 --> 02:54.205
OH, GOSH.

02:54.205 --> 02:56.447
(whispers) THEY'RE
AS WIDE AS THEY ARE LONG.

02:56.447 --> 02:57.778
I KNOW.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.650
IT'S...
(door opens)

02:59.650 --> 03:00.851
(door closes)

03:00.851 --> 03:03.414
THERE'S MY GIRL.
I NEED A KISS.

03:03.414 --> 03:04.885
YOU'LL LIVE.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.787
LOVE YOU!

03:06.787 --> 03:08.419
YOU JUST GOT ICED, SON.

03:08.419 --> 03:10.691
I WORSHIP ELLIE EVEN WHEN
SHE IS A LITTLE DISTANT.
(door closes)

03:10.691 --> 03:13.894
BESIDES, IF I NEED AFFECTION,
THERE ARE PLACES

03:13.894 --> 03:16.727
TO GET MY NEEDS MET
OUTSIDE THE MARRIAGE.

03:16.727 --> 03:18.469
KNOW WHAT IMEAN?

03:18.469 --> 03:20.671
(popping lips)

03:20.671 --> 03:22.273
DOG PARK, BABY!

03:22.273 --> 03:23.934
(dogs barking and growling)

03:23.934 --> 03:26.807
OH, I LOVE YOU! OH, YES!
OH, THAT'S WHAT I NEED!

03:26.807 --> 03:28.739
OH, THAT TICKLES!

03:28.739 --> 03:31.742
I AM MARRIED! DON'T YOU SEE
THIS RING? (laughs)

03:31.742 --> 03:33.814
YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY QUIET.

03:33.814 --> 03:37.788
MM, I'M NOT REALLY
READY TO TALK YET.

03:37.788 --> 03:39.950
ARE YOU READY
TO BE DOMINATED?

03:39.950 --> 03:41.552
(laughs)

03:41.552 --> 03:44.555
WHOO! DOMINATION!

03:44.555 --> 03:46.897
I DO LOVE THIS GAME.

03:46.897 --> 03:49.830
HEY, SON.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE D-BALL?

03:49.830 --> 03:51.462
CAN'T. (sighs)

03:51.462 --> 03:52.603
(high-pitched voice) WHEW!

03:52.603 --> 03:53.904
(normal voice)
HEADED BACK TO SCHOOL.

03:53.904 --> 03:55.366
BUNCH OF HOT, CRUNCHY CHICKS

03:55.366 --> 03:57.007
ARE HAVING AN ECO RALLY
ON CAMPUS.

03:57.007 --> 04:02.673
FIGURE DOG POWER HERE MIGHT HELP
GET ME INTO SOME HEMP PANTIES.

04:02.673 --> 04:03.774
TO COLLEGE!
(barks)

04:03.774 --> 04:04.815
YA!

04:04.815 --> 04:07.918
(barks)

04:07.918 --> 04:09.650
SEEMS SAFE.

04:09.650 --> 04:13.284
NAH, HE'LL BE FINE.
I DREW UP THE PLANS MYSELF.

04:13.284 --> 04:14.725
DOG AND A ROPE?

04:14.725 --> 04:16.857
PATENT PENDING.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.729
YOU KNOW, SINCE IT'S
JUST YOU AND ME TONIGHT,

04:18.729 --> 04:21.332
I FIGURED WE COULD JUST HANG OUT
AND WATCH A LITTLE TV,

04:21.332 --> 04:23.294
DOWN HERE, UPSTAIRS,
WHATEVER.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.795
YOU'RE ASKING FOR SEX,
AREN'T YOU?

04:24.795 --> 04:26.266
MM-HMM, BUT IN A CUTE WAY.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.839
SORRY. I GOTTA GET THIS
GUEST LIST UNDER A HUNDRED.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.801
(sighs)
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I KNOW THIS SUCKS,

04:30.801 --> 04:32.773
BUT I PROMISE
IT'S GONNA BE WORTH IT.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.677
OUR WEDDING IS GONNA BE
SO FUN ANDSO SEXY.

04:36.677 --> 04:40.681
(chuckles) WE'RE GONNA GO CRAZY
ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT, AREN'T WE?

04:40.681 --> 04:42.383
OH, YEAH.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.586
MAYBE. I GET REALLY
TIRED AT WEDDINGS.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.558
HOLD ON.

04:47.558 --> 04:49.690
YOU MOCK ME,

04:49.690 --> 04:52.323
YET MY LIFE IS YOUR FUTURE,
MY FRIEND--

04:52.323 --> 04:57.027
A SOLITARY MARCH TO THE GRAVE,
A MAN... IGNORED.

04:57.027 --> 04:59.700
SHE'S JUST DISTRACTED
WITH WEDDING STUFF, OKAY?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.373
NO WOMAN CAN IGNORE...
"THE TRUTH."

05:02.373 --> 05:03.974
DID YOU JUST
CALL YOUR BODY "THE TRUTH"?

05:03.974 --> 05:06.036
I DID, AND I DID IT
UNIRONICALLY.

05:06.036 --> 05:08.779
WELL, GRAYSON... TRUTH...

05:08.779 --> 05:11.512
YOU CAN'T USE THE WEDDING
AS AN EXCUSE.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.845
YOU THINK YOU COME FIRST?
I BET YOU'RE NOT EVEN TOP FIVE.

05:14.845 --> 05:16.447
THE TRUTH IS TOP FIVE.

05:16.447 --> 05:19.850
HA. AH, WELL,
HERE'S HER CELL.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.422
ALL RIGHT.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.524
WELL, LET'S CHECK
HER SPEED DIAL, SHALL WE?

05:23.524 --> 05:26.056
NUMBER ONE--TRAVIS--
NO SURPRISE THERE.

05:26.056 --> 05:27.598
NUMBER TWO...

05:27.598 --> 05:28.999
HI, ELLIE. IT'S ME.
YEAH, JUST SHOWING GRAYS--

05:28.999 --> 05:30.631
(line disconnects)
HELLO?

05:30.631 --> 05:33.464
SHE HUNG UP. HAPPENS A LOT.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.065
THREE'S HER DAD.

05:35.065 --> 05:38.369
FOUR'S WAYNE'S WINE STORE.
THOUGHT THAT'D BE HIGHER.

05:38.369 --> 05:40.611
OOP, THERE YOU ARE!
NUMBER FIVE!

05:40.611 --> 05:42.813
YOU WERE RIGHT,
I WAS WRONG. OHH.

05:42.813 --> 05:45.546
WELL, YOU'RE THE FIFTH
MOST IMPORTANT PERSON

05:45.546 --> 05:48.118
TO YOUR FUTURE WIFE.
CONGRATS.

05:48.118 --> 05:50.651
(cell phone rings)

05:50.651 --> 05:53.484
OH, HONEY, HAND ME MY CELL.
COULD BE THE WINE SHOP.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.686
HELLO?

05:55.686 --> 05:58.489
WHAT?

05:58.489 --> 06:00.891
OKAY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

06:00.891 --> 06:03.994
(beep)
TRAVIS HAD AN ACCIDENT.
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.566
OH.
WHOO!

06:05.566 --> 06:07.668
TASTE THE DOMINANCE!

06:09.069 --> 06:10.741
WHAT?

06:10.741 --> 06:12.873
(whispers) COME ON.

06:16.647 --> 06:17.878
YOUR SON TOOK A BAD FALL.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.410
HE HAS A SMALL SKULL FRACTURE,
BUT HE'S CONSCIOUS,

06:19.410 --> 06:21.612
AND THERE'S NO BRAIN SWELLING,
SO HE SHOULD BE OKAY.

06:21.612 --> 06:23.784
HE'LL BE BACK TO HIS ROOM
IN A FEW MINUTES,

06:23.784 --> 06:25.015
AND YOU CAN SEE HIM.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.958
WAS THERE AN "OKAY"
IN THERE?

06:27.958 --> 06:29.720
'CAUSE IF THERE WAS,
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

06:29.720 --> 06:30.721
HE SAID "OKAY."

06:30.721 --> 06:31.722
(exhales deeply) OH, GOOD.

06:31.722 --> 06:32.993
HEY, JULES?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.596
TRAV WILL STILL PROBABLY NEED
A FOLLOW-UP CAT SCAN.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.128
HEY, TOM, IT'S SWEET YOU CAME,
BUT WHY DON'T YOU

06:38.128 --> 06:40.000
LEAVE THE MEDICAL STUFF
TO THE DOCTORS?

06:40.000 --> 06:44.174
UH, I AM A DOCTOR.
I'M THE HEAD NEUROSURGEON HERE.

06:44.174 --> 06:46.877
COME ON, YOU DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS A DOCTOR?

06:46.877 --> 06:47.878
PLEASE.
YEAH.

06:47.878 --> 06:49.139
'COURSE.
YEAH.

06:49.139 --> 06:50.881
(woman over P.A.)
DR. GAZELIAN, TO THE E.R.

06:50.881 --> 06:53.113
OH, WELL, TOM,
DON'T WALK AWAY ANGRY.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.985
THEY JUST PAGED ME.

06:54.985 --> 06:57.448
DO YOU PEOPLE NOT EVEN KNOW
MY LAST NAME?

06:57.448 --> 06:59.590
OF COURSE
WE KNOW YOUR LAST NAME.

06:59.590 --> 07:02.953
THEN SAY IT. THEY JUST SAID IT
ON THE INTERCOM TWO SECONDS AGO.

07:02.953 --> 07:04.495
WHO CARES?
GALIFIANAKIS?

07:04.495 --> 07:05.996
GABBA GABBA HEY?
GAZOO?

07:05.996 --> 07:07.097
GAZOINKS.

07:07.097 --> 07:09.600
YOU THINK MY NAME
IS TOM GAZOINKS?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.503
TOM, I'VE HAD A ROUGH DAY.
YOU THINK I COULD GET A PASS?

07:14.565 --> 07:16.136
(under breath)
CAN I STILL BE MAD AT THEM?

07:16.136 --> 07:17.568
(under breath) GO NUTS.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.870
(whispers)
YOU... YOU, YOU...

07:19.870 --> 07:21.472
(mouths words)

07:21.472 --> 07:23.443
YOU CAN SEE YOUR SON NOW.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.845
OH, THANK YOU.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.446
OKAY, WAIT.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.718
I'M GONNA GET TRAVIS
THROUGH THIS,

07:27.718 --> 07:29.620
BUT I'M REALLY GONNA
NEED ALL OF YOUR HELP.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.052
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW
HE CAN SPIRAL PRETTY EASILY.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.684
HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL
OVER A GIRL

07:33.684 --> 07:37.558
WHO I THINK WE ALL CAN AGREE
WAS NOT VERY SPECIAL.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.559
NOPE.
NO.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.760
SHE WAS NO YOU.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.732
THEY NEVER ARE.

07:41.732 --> 07:43.093
ANYWAY, WHEN WE SEE HIM,

07:43.093 --> 07:45.666
CAN WE JUST ALL BE
SUPER POSITIVE, YOU KNOW?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.569
JUST HAPPY FACES
AND HAPPY THOUGHTS?

07:54.805 --> 07:57.978
(singsongy)
HAPPY FACES. HAPPY THOUGHTS.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.810
(normal voice) OKAY.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.814
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

08:03.814 --> 08:05.155
I FRACTURED MY SKULL.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.758
I MEAN, THINGS WERE
GOING GREAT AT COLLEGE,

08:07.758 --> 08:10.821
AND NOW I AM STUCK
IN A HOSPITAL.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.222
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

08:12.222 --> 08:15.666
YEAH, IT DOES.
HOSPITALS ARE SCARY.

08:15.666 --> 08:16.697
(clenches teeth)
HAPPY THOUGHTS.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.068
BUT NOT THIS ROOM.

08:18.068 --> 08:22.032
THERE'S ALL THESE BUTTONS
AND THERE'S TUBES.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.104
I BET NO ONE
EVER DIED IN HERE.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.776
MAYBE ONLY I TALK.

08:25.776 --> 08:27.878
RIGHT NOW IT DOES SUCK,

08:27.878 --> 08:29.980
BUT I'M GONNA GET YOU
THROUGH IT.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.682
I MEAN, PLUS YOU HAVE
AN AWESOME STORY.

08:31.682 --> 08:33.784
YOU HAVE A FRACTURED SKULL.

08:33.784 --> 08:36.116
GIRLS ARE GONNA THINK
YOU'RE A TOTAL BADASS.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.920
THAT'S TRUE. BACK IN COLLEGE,
I WAS A SUCKER FOR INJURIES.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.653
IF A GUY HAD A SCAR
OR A MISSING FINGER,

08:42.653 --> 08:44.154
WE JUST DID STUFF.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.857
I MISS BEING A HO.

08:46.857 --> 08:49.960
YOU WANT BACK IN?
'CAUSE WE'LL TAKE YOU BACK.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.633
YEAH, I'M SURE PANTIES WILL DROP
WHEN GIRLS FIND OUT

08:52.633 --> 08:55.806
I WAS BEING PULLED BY MY DOG
ON A SKATEBOARD,

08:55.806 --> 08:57.107
SAW A MONARCH BUTTERFLY,

08:57.107 --> 09:01.071
AND SAID, "HEY, YOU'RE NOT
NATIVE TO FLORIDA"--CRASH.

09:01.071 --> 09:04.274
SO CHANGE THE STORY.
GRAYSON HAS A SCAR.

09:04.274 --> 09:07.017
HE TOLD ME IT WAS
FROM A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT.

09:07.017 --> 09:08.919
WHY DON'T YOU TELL 'EM
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

09:08.919 --> 09:10.621
I DON'T WANT TO.
TELL IT.

09:10.621 --> 09:11.982
I BURNT IT
ON MY CURLING IRON.

09:11.982 --> 09:13.023
(laughs)

09:13.023 --> 09:14.955
IT WAS THE '90s.
SHUT UP.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.957
DAMN. PRETTY BOY HAD A PERM.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.029
THERE'S MY HAPPY BOY.

09:19.029 --> 09:21.261
OH, MAN.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.694
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
INVENTED DOG BOARDING.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.766
NOW HIS LIFE'S FALLING APART.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.037
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

09:27.037 --> 09:29.700
SORRY. (sniffles)
IT'S JUST SO SAD.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.043
I KNOW WHAT WILL HELP.
SORRY.

09:33.043 --> 09:35.706
(laughs)
(dogs growling and barking)

09:35.706 --> 09:39.079
LOOK, GRAYSON.
THEY SENSE YOUR LONELINESS.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.781
(panting)

09:40.781 --> 09:43.153
LET THEM FIX IT.

09:47.017 --> 09:49.189
OH, HEY,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.062
YEAH. I JUST WANTED
TO WATCH HIM SLEEP.

09:52.062 --> 09:55.095
(whispers)
I'LL STAY WITH YOU.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.596
(door closes)

09:56.596 --> 09:58.799
OH. OKAY.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.702
HONEY, THERE'S A CHAIR
RIGHT BACK THERE.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.705
(sighs)

10:04.705 --> 10:05.936
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:05.936 --> 10:06.977
(sighs)

10:06.977 --> 10:08.208
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.780
WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

10:09.780 --> 10:11.712
YOU'VE BEEN PAYING A LOT
OF ATTENTION TO ME LATELY.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.013
OH, SWEETIE.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.016
LET ME TURN DOWN THE VOLUME
OF MY SON'S HEART MONITOR

10:16.016 --> 10:18.148
SO I CAN FOCUS ON YOU BETTER.

10:18.148 --> 10:20.190
WHEN I IMAGINED THIS
CONVERSATION ON THE WAY OVER,

10:20.190 --> 10:21.251
IT WENT MUCH BETTER.

10:21.251 --> 10:22.953
NO, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

10:22.953 --> 10:25.155
OH, GREAT. YOU'RE AWAKE.

10:25.155 --> 10:27.157
(rock music playing)

10:27.157 --> 10:28.899
(rock music stops playing)

10:28.899 --> 10:30.831
WHAT? SOMETIMES,
WHEN I NEED TO THINK,

10:30.831 --> 10:32.963
I'LL GO BLADING AT THE BEACH
WITH MY BOOM BOX.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.364
OY!

10:34.364 --> 10:36.837
(cheering)

10:36.837 --> 10:38.138
(Andy and Grayson) DOMINATED!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.369
(makes trilling sound)

10:39.369 --> 10:41.111
(all laugh)

10:41.111 --> 10:42.242
UH-OH.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.852
WHICH ONE
OF YOU TOOL BAGS

10:51.852 --> 10:54.424
SAID THAT GIRLS CAN'T PLAY
THIS STUPID GAME?

10:54.424 --> 10:56.056
YOU'RE ONHERTEAM?

10:56.056 --> 11:00.130
WE BONDED OVER YOUR MONSTER FEET
AND JUSTICE FOR WOMEN.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.432
(scoffs)

11:02.432 --> 11:05.135
A'IGHT. FIRST OF ALL,
GIRLS THROW LIKE CHICKS.

11:05.135 --> 11:06.897
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
Y'ALL RUIN OUR GAMES.

11:06.897 --> 11:08.769
YOU KNOW, YOU GALS
TAKE EVERYTHING SO PERSONALLY

11:08.769 --> 11:09.840
AND GET ALL EMOTIONAL.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.271
THAT'S JUST A STEREOTYPE.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.104
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
ALL BLONDES ARE DUMB.

11:14.104 --> 11:16.006
BUT THAT--
SHH. SAME TEAM.

11:16.006 --> 11:21.151
FINE, YOU'RE IN, BUT THE SECOND
SOMEONE CRIES, GAME OVER.

11:21.151 --> 11:24.855
YEAH!
CHICKS VERSUS STICKS, Y'ALL!

11:24.855 --> 11:26.787
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'D ANDY GO?

11:27.858 --> 11:31.291
(men) OHH! DOMINATED!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.123
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
WHOO!

11:33.123 --> 11:34.324
OH, MY GOD.

11:34.324 --> 11:37.267
THAT WAS SCARY AND HUMILIATING
AT THE SAME TIME--

11:37.267 --> 11:39.800
(voice breaking)
THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE ME CRY.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.871
FIGHT IT.

11:40.871 --> 11:44.134
(pants) I'M--I'M--O--I'M OKAY.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.736
GAME ON.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.137
(Bobby) OY!

11:50.911 --> 11:52.712
I GOT YOUR COMPUTER.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.715
OH, I SPOKE TO YOUR TEACHERS
AND I GOT ALL YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.717
OH, JOY.
HOMEWORK IN THE HOSPITAL.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.422
BY THE WAY, YOUR BIO PROFESSOR
MR. DAWKINS? WAY INTO ME.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.756
I COULD GET YOU AN "A"
JUST BY MAKING OUT WITH HIM.

12:05.756 --> 12:06.797
WELL, I HATE
TO BURST YOUR BUBBLE,

12:06.797 --> 12:08.428
BUT I COULD GET
THAT "A" MYSELF...

12:08.428 --> 12:10.360
ALSO BY MAKING OUT WITH HIM.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.332
REALLY? HIM?

12:12.332 --> 12:15.205
WELL, THAT WAS
A WASTED LIP BITE.

12:15.205 --> 12:16.206
A WHAT?

12:16.206 --> 12:18.338
(moans)

12:18.338 --> 12:22.212
OKAY, YOU REALIZE
I CAN'T UN-SEE THAT, RIGHT?

12:22.212 --> 12:23.814
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE HAVING TO WAIT ON ME

12:23.814 --> 12:25.075
HAND-AND-FOOT
IN THE HOSPITAL.

12:25.075 --> 12:27.077
I KNOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ALL WEDDING, ALL THE TIME.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.348
A.W.A.T.T.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.950
IS THAT
"ALL WEDDING ALL THE TIME"?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.852
A-WHAT-WHAT-WHAT?

12:31.852 --> 12:33.954
A-WHAT-WHAT-WHAT-WHAT-WHAT?

12:33.954 --> 12:36.086
A-WHAT-WHAT? WHAT-WHAT?

12:36.086 --> 12:37.828
A-WHAT? OKAY, WE GOTTA STOP.

12:37.828 --> 12:39.089
I KNOW.

12:39.089 --> 12:41.932
HOW HAVE YOU HELD IT TOGETHER
WITH THIS WHOLE TRAVIS THING?

12:41.932 --> 12:44.965
I MEAN, IF STAN EVEN SCRAPES
HIS KNEE, I TOTALLY FREAK OUT.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.397
YEAH, I AGREE,
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE KIDS.

12:47.397 --> 12:49.199
YOU PROBABLY DO.

12:49.199 --> 12:51.501
ONE COULD HAVE DROPPED OUT WHILE
YOU WERE SKANKING AROUND TOWN.

12:51.501 --> 12:53.844
TEAMMATES.
RIGHT, RIGHT. FORGOT.

12:53.844 --> 12:55.405
LOOK, YOU BOTH
COULD HANDLE THIS.

12:55.405 --> 12:58.308
THIS IS WHAT MOMS DO IN CRISIS--
YOU GET YOUR FAMILY THROUGH IT,

12:58.308 --> 13:00.780
AND THEN WHEN EVERYTHING'S
ALL BETTER, YOU FALL APART.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.314
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO BECOME
A CRYING, SNOTTY MESS.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.957
TO TOTAL MELTDOWNS.
(clink)

13:06.957 --> 13:08.819
OH, YEAH.

13:08.819 --> 13:11.021
(singsongy) IT'S READY.

13:11.021 --> 13:12.022
WHAT IS?

13:12.022 --> 13:13.023
(crunch)

13:13.023 --> 13:15.265
REVENGE.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.270
(thud)

13:20.270 --> 13:23.173
DOMINATED.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.838
OH! OH!

13:29.279 --> 13:30.810
HEY, SWEETIE.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.482
AH, THERE YOU ARE.

13:32.482 --> 13:35.145
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU NEED A KISS?

13:35.145 --> 13:38.318
(chuckles) YEAH. MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T CARE.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.550
(singsongy)
WELL, HERE IT COMES.

13:44.955 --> 13:46.196
UNCOOL.

13:46.196 --> 13:47.427
(thuds)

13:47.427 --> 13:49.499
YOU PSYCHED
TO GET OUT OF HERE?

13:49.499 --> 13:51.101
OH, TOTALLY.

13:51.101 --> 13:54.865
WE CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH...
DR. GAZELIAN.

13:54.865 --> 13:56.006
YOU REMEMBERED.

13:56.006 --> 13:58.438
OF COURSE. I'LL NEVER FORGET.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.110
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY IT AGAIN?

14:00.110 --> 14:02.272
I WOULD NOT.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.314
SO, TRAVIS, YOU GET
TO HEAD BACK TO COLLEGE

14:04.314 --> 14:06.917
AND JUMP INTO LIFE
LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.148
AND HERE'S YOUR HELMET.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.319
MY WHAT?

14:09.319 --> 14:11.521
IT'S PRETTY STANDARD
IN INJURIES LIKE THIS.

14:11.521 --> 14:14.424
WE DON'T WANT TO RISK
FURTHER TRAUMA TO THE AREA.

14:14.424 --> 14:16.386
IT'S ONLY FOR
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

14:16.386 --> 14:18.929
LOOK AT MY HANDSOME BOY.

14:18.929 --> 14:21.191
(gulps)

14:24.264 --> 14:26.967
OHH, I LOOK SO STUPID.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.568
NOT IF YOU'RE GOING
TO A HELMET PARTY.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.100
WHAT-WHAT?
TA-DA!

14:30.100 --> 14:32.242
(mumbles)

14:32.242 --> 14:34.204
BOBBY, RAISE YOUR VISOR.

14:35.245 --> 14:37.247
I LOVE YOU, SON.

14:37.247 --> 14:39.509
YOU GUYS ARE SUCH DORKS.

14:39.509 --> 14:43.253
THIS IS AN EXACT REPLICA OF
THE HELMET AMELIA EARHART WORE

14:43.253 --> 14:45.115
WHEN SHE INVENTED AIRPLANES.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.517
MNH-MNH.
WHEN HER BABY GOT STOLEN.

14:47.517 --> 14:48.658
NOPE.

14:48.658 --> 14:52.662
PLUS, I LOOK SUPER HOT
IN MY RIDING HELMET. CHECK IT.

14:52.662 --> 14:55.195
MNH-MNH. MM-HMM.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.467
WHY DO OLDER WOMEN
KEEP DOING THAT TO ME?

14:57.467 --> 14:58.999
WE JUST WANT TO
SEND YOU BACK TO COLLEGE

14:58.999 --> 15:00.270
WITH A SMILE, SWEETHEART.

15:00.270 --> 15:02.532
WELL, I WAS GONNA WAIT
UNTIL YOUR EULOGY TO SAY THIS,

15:02.532 --> 15:05.005
BUT, AH, WELL, HERE GOES.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.107
JULES KIKI COBB,

15:07.107 --> 15:10.240
YOU WERE A GREAT MOM.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.243
REST IN PEACE.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.187
I'M SO EXCITED TO DIE.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.650
THANK YOU, FRIEND.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:20.650 --> 15:23.553
I WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME
TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATRONAGE

15:23.553 --> 15:26.126
AND TO TELL YOU THAT I HOPE
TO SEE YOU AROUND HERE...

15:26.126 --> 15:28.698
REAL, REAL SOON.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.561
(Andy) WOW.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.563
DID I JUST SEE YOU
STEAL SOME HUMAN CONTACT

15:33.563 --> 15:34.634
FROM A TOTAL STRANGER?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.367
STOP IT, YOU BIG KOOK.
BAM! (chuckles)

15:37.367 --> 15:41.011
(imitates gunshots,
groans, chuckles)

15:42.342 --> 15:43.613
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

15:43.613 --> 15:47.177
OHH. WHO CARES?
OH, YEAH. WORK THE NECK.

15:47.177 --> 15:48.678
GET OFF ME, ANDY,
YOU WEIRDO.

15:48.678 --> 15:50.350
ALL RIGHT.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.682
THE GALS ARE OVER AT J-BIRD'S,
BUT THEY'RE ALL WEARING HELMETS,

15:52.682 --> 15:54.124
SO IF YOU WANT
TO CAUSE SOME DAMAGE,

15:54.124 --> 15:55.555
YOU GOTTA HIT 'EM
IN THE KNOCKERS. (whistles)

15:55.555 --> 15:58.058
I'M OUT. THE GIRLS ARE TOO MEAN.
IT'S SCARY.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.429
WHAT?NO, IT'S NOT.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.231
REALLY? LIFT UP YOUR SHIRT.

16:02.292 --> 16:03.293
(chuckles)

16:03.293 --> 16:04.464
OW.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.066
WE'RE NOT QUITTING.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.467
I'M OUT, TOO, MAN,
AND... (sighs)

16:07.467 --> 16:09.599
I REALLY HATE
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

16:09.599 --> 16:12.742
COME HERE.
I'M SO, SO, SO SORRY.

16:12.742 --> 16:14.004
DUDE.

16:14.004 --> 16:16.206
(whispers) NO WORDS.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.608
WELL, IT'S OVER.
HE'S HEADING BACK.

16:18.608 --> 16:21.151
WAY TO GO, SUPER MOM.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.153
AND NOW THAT IT'S ALL BETTER,

16:23.153 --> 16:26.386
YOU GET TO FALL APART AND HAVE
YOUR MELTDOWN LIKE YOU PROMISED.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.089
YOU COULD THROW SOME DISHES,
MAYBE SHAVE YOUR HEAD.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.990
I COULD NEVER SHAVE MY HEAD,

16:30.990 --> 16:33.563
NOT WITHTHESEEARS.
OH.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.325
I WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE OF THOSE
MONKEYS HOLDING THE CYMBALS.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.497
(grunts)

16:37.497 --> 16:40.100
OH. MM.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.333
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S TRAVIS IS GETTING OLDER

16:43.333 --> 16:45.035
OR I'M GETTING WISER,

16:45.035 --> 16:47.577
BUT I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA
NEED TO FALL APART THIS TIME.

16:47.577 --> 16:49.709
WHAT A RIP-OFF.
I WAS SO EXCITED.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.042
NO.
BIG CARL CAN STAY.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.643
HE'S THERE
FOR GOOD TIMES AND BAD.

16:53.643 --> 16:56.286
(sighs) I'M HEADING OUT.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.788
HEY, BUSTER, I THINK THE HELMET
WORKS BETTERONYOUR HEAD.

16:58.788 --> 17:02.552
YEAH, BUT IT'S COLLEGE, AND IT
LOOKSA LITTLE RIDICULOUS,SO...

17:02.552 --> 17:04.154
I CAN'T WEAR IT ALL THE TIME,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

17:04.154 --> 17:07.627
I'LL BE CAREFUL. PEACE.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.164
(whispers)
YAY. HERE IT COMES.

17:14.164 --> 17:16.806
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

17:16.806 --> 17:21.141
I HATE MYSELF.
I MEAN, I USED TO BE A MAN.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.543
YOU MUST LOVE
SEEING ME LIKE THIS.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.075
I REALLY DO.

17:25.075 --> 17:28.478
AS SOON AS YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
TO SOMEONE, THEY JUST PULL AWAY.

17:28.478 --> 17:31.151
IT'S LIKE I LEARNED NOTHING
FROM KATHERINE HEIGL MOVIES.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.252
YOU CAN'T GO BACK

17:32.252 --> 17:34.354
TO BEING AN EMOTIONALLY
WALLED-OFF CYBORG.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.427
THAT'S HOW YOU MESSED UP
YOUR FIRST MARRIAGE.

17:37.427 --> 17:38.828
STOPPED SHARING YOUR FEELINGS,

17:38.828 --> 17:42.061
SPENT HOURS FIXING A BREAD MAKER
THAT WASN'T BROKEN

17:42.061 --> 17:44.434
JUST TO AVOID
ANOTHER SILENT DINNER.

17:44.434 --> 17:47.237
HOW? I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU BACK THEN.

17:47.237 --> 17:48.398
WHEN I GOT BORED,

17:48.398 --> 17:50.440
I'D GET A CHAIR
AND SIT OUTSIDE YOUR WINDOW.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.472
I REALLY LIKED
YOUR HAIR BACK THEN.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.545
THANKS. SO DID I,
BUT JULES LIKES IT LIKE THIS.

17:55.545 --> 17:57.847
(mumbles) I'M THE LAMEST.

17:57.847 --> 18:01.181
PLEASE. I ROLL AROUND
WITH STRANGE DOGS.

18:01.181 --> 18:05.255
YOU KNOW, AS MEN, I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THAT MUCH.

18:05.255 --> 18:07.287
I JUST WANT HER TO GIVE ME
ATTENTION WHEN I WANT IT

18:07.287 --> 18:09.219
AND TO LEAVE ME ALONE
WHEN I DON'T WANT IT.

18:09.219 --> 18:10.290
YEAH, LIKE A BABY.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.223
EXACTLY.
JUST TREAT ME LIKE A BABY.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.325
WHEN WE WANT AFFECTION,
THEY DON'T GIVE IT TO US,

18:15.325 --> 18:17.167
BUT IF WE DON'T WANT IT,
THEY COME RUNNING.

18:17.167 --> 18:19.199
THE KEY IS TO
NEVER LOOK DESPERATE.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.100
BUT YOU ALWAYS
LOOK DESPERATE.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.802
DIDN'T SAY I WAS GOOD AT IT.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.474
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
REALLY LET PEOPLE SEE

18:24.474 --> 18:26.276
THOSE PAINTINGS YOU'VE BEEN
WORKING ON IN YOUR ROOM.

18:26.276 --> 18:27.477
STOP SPYING ON ME.

18:27.477 --> 18:29.279
STOP BEING SO TALENTED.

18:29.279 --> 18:30.840
(Benjamin Francis Leftwich's
"Pictures" playing)

18:30.840 --> 18:33.543
SO YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME.

18:33.543 --> 18:35.715
I WAS FREAKING OUT.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.588
YOU KNOW, I ALMOST DIED ONCE
AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK.

18:38.588 --> 18:41.351
I GOT STRANGLED
BY AN ANIMATRONIC BEAR.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.693
TURNS OUT WHEN YOU THROW
A WHOLE CUP OF SODA ON THEM,

18:43.693 --> 18:45.155
THOSE THINGS GO CRAZY.

18:45.155 --> 18:46.756
IT DOESN'T MAKE
A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE,

18:46.756 --> 18:49.829
BUT THEY ACTUALLY
HAD TO SHOOT IT.

18:49.829 --> 18:53.333
LAURIE'S ABOUT TO
TASTE SOME DOMINANCE.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.764
(chuckles)

18:54.764 --> 18:56.766
в™Є YOUR BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE в™Є

18:56.766 --> 18:58.508
OH.

18:58.508 --> 19:00.470
(whoosh, slap)
OH.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.512
OHH.

19:02.512 --> 19:04.514
THIS COULD HAVE
SPLIT YOUR HEAD OPEN.

19:04.514 --> 19:06.876
MOM, IT'S JUST A SQUISHY BALL.

19:06.876 --> 19:08.648
BUCKLE UP. HERE WE GO.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.680
THIS SQUISHY BALL REPRESENTS

19:10.680 --> 19:13.683
EVERYTHING BAD IN THE WORLD
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU.

19:13.683 --> 19:18.688
SO BECAUSE OF ONE FREAK ACCIDENT
YOU'RE JUST MELTING DOWN?

19:18.688 --> 19:22.432
I'M ALMOST 20, REMEMBER?
YOU CAN STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME.

19:22.432 --> 19:24.634
NO, I CAN'T, YOU IDIOT!

19:24.634 --> 19:26.936
I WILL NEVER STOP
WORRYING ABOUT YOU.

19:26.936 --> 19:28.538
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE 80

19:28.538 --> 19:30.470
AND I'M TELLING EVERYONE
THAT I'M 90--

19:30.470 --> 19:32.171
AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT,
BY THE WAY--

19:32.171 --> 19:35.505
I WILL STILL LAY AWAKE AT NIGHT
IN THE NURSING HOME...

19:35.505 --> 19:37.547
(voice breaking)
WHERE WE LIVE TOGETHER,

19:37.547 --> 19:39.649
WAITING FOR YOU TO GET HOME.

19:39.649 --> 19:42.482
SHE'S CRYING. THAT MEANS
WE WIN DOMINANCE BALL.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.884
TRUE, BUT NOT THE TIME.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.287
TRAVIS,
NOW THAT YOU'RE OLDER,

19:47.287 --> 19:52.322
NOTHING'S CHANGED, EXCEPT I CAN
NO LONGER TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.

19:52.322 --> 19:54.824
I CAN ONLY ASK.

19:56.296 --> 19:59.299
SO PLEASE...

19:59.299 --> 20:01.301
PLEASE WEAR THAT STUPID HELMET,
SO I CAN SLEEP.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.973
в™Є IF YOU ARE AFRAID, DON'T BE в™Є

20:03.973 --> 20:07.837
в™Є I HAVE
THE WHOLE THING PLANNED в™Є

20:07.837 --> 20:11.841
в™Є WE'LL START IN THE OCEAN,
BABY в™Є

20:11.841 --> 20:14.314
в™Є WHEN WE FIND THE LAND в™Є

20:14.314 --> 20:16.616
I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE ALL PARENTS,

20:16.616 --> 20:20.350
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT SCARES ME
MOST ABOUT KIDS?

20:20.350 --> 20:22.822
I MEAN, STAN MAY PROMISE
NOT TO CROSS THE STREET

20:22.822 --> 20:24.794
AND TRAV MAY SAY
HE'S GONNA WEAR THAT HELMET,

20:24.794 --> 20:27.457
BUT ONCE THEY'RE
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT,

20:27.457 --> 20:30.500
YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW,
DO YOU?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.861
в™Є AND YOU'VE SEEN в™Є

20:31.861 --> 20:34.904
в™Є THE WAY THAT THINGS WORK в™Є

20:34.904 --> 20:37.467
в™Є BUT YOU NEED A COMPASS TO в™Є
(dogs bark)

20:37.467 --> 20:38.708
WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING?

20:38.708 --> 20:42.572
в™Є GET AROUND YOUR HOUSE в™Є

20:46.316 --> 20:48.548
HEY. WHATCHA UP TO?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.020
BACK TO ALL WEDDING,
ALL THE TIME.

20:51.020 --> 20:53.653
SOMEONE ADDED A NAME
TO THE GUEST LIST.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.956
"T. GAZELIAN"?
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

20:56.956 --> 20:59.359
(exhales deeply)

20:59.359 --> 21:01.491
(lowered voice)
BE COOL. SIT BACK DOWN.

21:01.491 --> 21:02.792
(whispers)
STOP SPYING ON ME.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.964
DON'T BE DESPERATE.
LET HER COME TO YOU.

21:16.406 --> 21:18.308
(sighs)

21:18.308 --> 21:19.779
SCOOT OVER.

21:25.685 --> 21:27.687
(both moaning softly)
