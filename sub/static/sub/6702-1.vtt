Ripped from Blu-Ray 
by.gioni666

01:00.728 --> 01:02.822
Camila.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.413
Ready?

03:31.253 --> 03:34.507
- I'm coming.
- You'll never beat me.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.926
My God, look at this little town.
How cute is this?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.216
Wow.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.763
Oh, come here.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.604
- Hola.
- Hola.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.198
You know, we're close to that river
that used to be

04:37.361 --> 04:39.739
Argentina's main trade route
into Paraguay.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.418
Apparently it used to be
a pretty happening town.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.419
A lot of smugglers
and rough types.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.421
Really?

04:48.580 --> 04:50.833
I like it already.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.967
Pick one.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.298
Uh...

04:54.461 --> 04:56.589
-this one. Yeah.
- This one?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.428
Thanks.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.103
Here you go.
You can keep the change.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.226
Thanks.
I mean, gracias.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.979
De nada.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.114
Go on, ask her.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.625
- Go.
- Um...

05:25.784 --> 05:28.754
Buenas tardes.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.962
Um, donde está
El Hotel Rosarnaria?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.888
Okay. Gracias.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.645
Did you get all that?

05:45.804 --> 05:47.772
Shut up.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.015
Hello?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.188
Hola.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.898
- Hello?
- Hola.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.360
- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.526
Um, me llamo es Stephanie.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.410
Mm-hmm.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.196
Y nosotros tenemos un, um...

06:44.362 --> 06:46.035
You have a reservation?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.371
- You speak English.
- Yes.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.958
Luca.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.667
You stay only one night, yes?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.460
Yes.
Actually, we leave tomorrow.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.551
Do you know what time the bus
to Posadas leaves?

07:01.713 --> 07:04.102
At 8:00.
And it's the only one of the day.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.555
Please tell me that's 8:00 PM.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.313
I'm sorry.
It's 8:00 in the morning.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.849
Figures.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.017
- Your passport, please.
- Oh yeah.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.278
Ellie.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.112
"Assport"?

07:21.274 --> 07:22.446
Ellie.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.906
That's a good one.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.285
You are not traveling alone,
are you?

07:31.451 --> 07:34.455
Um, well, yes and no.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.089
We were traveling with a bike tour

07:36.248 --> 07:39.593
but we kind of went AWOL
after the first day.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.130
Yes, I see.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.472
Well, please let me know
if you need anything.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.307
- Cool.
- Thank you.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.595
Okay.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.639
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

08:17.873 --> 08:18.999
One key.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.964
Oh, gracias.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.254
- Ah.
- Weirdo.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.093
Cute.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.883
Yeah, this is cute.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.768
Hmm.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.815
Whoa!

08:37.475 --> 08:39.739
First shower.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.648
Ugh, this is gross.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.143
Ugh.
Hey, Steph.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.902
There's no towels.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.439
Yeah, coming.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.158
Here are your towels.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.820
Danke schoen.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.851
What did you say to those guys?

10:32.007 --> 10:34.180
Nothing, just that you're single.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.855
Gee, thanks, El.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.526
Okay, I like the potential.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.489
Yeah, it's nice.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.776
Oh, excuse me.
Two cervezas, por favor.

10:50.942 --> 10:53.821
Gracias.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.539
Is that Nick?

11:02.203 --> 11:05.127
Seriously?
He's such a dick.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.130
I know.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.295
But maybe I should
just talk to him.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.009
No. No no no.
Don't even think--

11:12.172 --> 11:13.515
it's so not worth it.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.266
I know, but...

11:15.425 --> 11:17.098
You know I'm not--

11:17.260 --> 11:18.512
I'm not good
at being alone.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.306
I know, but I'm right here.

11:21.473 --> 11:22.770
Okay?

11:22.932 --> 11:26.152
- We had fun.
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.609
We're about to have more fun too.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.695
Gracias.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.156
Um, disculpe.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.163
We didn't order these.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.664
Don't be rude.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.970
Mmm!

11:52.128 --> 11:55.007
Whoo!
All right!

11:58.134 --> 12:00.523
- No no.
- Yeah yeah.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.817
- Ellie, no. Seriously, I'm done.
- Just shut up and drink.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.235
Tomorrow's gonna suck.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.519
Yes, but that's what Advil is for.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.278
Come on, it's our last night.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.781
To you and me.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.783
Salud.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.490
- I can't--
- That was hard.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.035
Whoo.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.220
What about him?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.723
I don't know.
You think he's my type?

12:36.881 --> 12:39.100
Totally.
He looks...

12:39.259 --> 12:41.057
Responsible.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.314
Should I invite him over?
I can totally invite him over.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.449
- No. El, stop. Sit down.
- I’m gonna do that for you.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.997
Jesus, sit down! Sit down!
He's gonna look over here, Ellie.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.201
- Stay.
- Isn't that the point?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.163
Oh my God.
Are you hearing this?

13:04.325 --> 13:07.044
Do you hear this? Please don't
tell me you're not hearing this.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.171
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing us all a favor.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.584
Oh no no,
you cannot play that song.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.893
- Ugh, Ellie.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.847
My friend wants to know
why you don't like the song.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.890
Well, 'cause there's a fine line
between irony and just plain bad.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.194
Kind of like...

13:28.349 --> 13:29.817
Your shirt.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.773
All right.
No.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.943
Nope.

13:38.109 --> 13:40.111
Okay.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.412
This one's for you, baby.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.290
# I love myself #

13:52.457 --> 13:55.210
# I want you to love me #

13:55.376 --> 13:59.176
# When I feel down,
I want you above me #

13:59.339 --> 14:03.640
# I search myself,
I want you to find me #

14:03.801 --> 14:08.557
# I forget myself,
I want you to remind me #

14:09.641 --> 14:13.691
# I don't want anybody else #

14:13.853 --> 14:15.855
# When I think about you #

14:16.022 --> 14:18.491
# I touch myself, ooh #

14:18.650 --> 14:22.325
# I don't want anybody else... #

14:22.487 --> 14:24.160
- Senor.
- # Oh no oh no #

14:24.322 --> 14:25.995
# Oh no... #

14:26.157 --> 14:28.626
Hey hey hey.
Take it easy.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.753
- No problem here.
- # You're the one #

14:30.912 --> 14:33.210
# Who makes me come running #

14:33.373 --> 14:37.344
# You're the sun
who makes me shine #

14:37.502 --> 14:41.348
# When you're around
I'm always laughing... #

14:41.506 --> 14:43.258
Hey, where are you going?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.847
Um, el peepee.

14:46.010 --> 14:49.765
# I close my eyes
and see you above me #

14:49.931 --> 14:54.402
# Think I would die
if you were to ignore me... #

14:56.354 --> 14:58.698
Girl emergency.
Sorry.

15:00.358 --> 15:04.113
# I'd do anything for you #

15:04.279 --> 15:07.909
# I don't want anybody else... #

15:11.703 --> 15:15.628
# Oh, I don't want... #

15:21.212 --> 15:24.933
You're not from around
these parts, are you?

15:30.888 --> 15:32.640
Performance anxiety?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.105
You should stick close
to your friend.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.494
Wow.
That backfired.

15:48.656 --> 15:52.411
# I honestly do,
I touch myself #

15:52.577 --> 15:54.420
# I touch myself. #

16:11.387 --> 16:13.139
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.729
- Do you want to sit?
- Yeah. Thank you.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.315
- Let me take your picture.
- Okay.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.776
- Did you get it?
- Mm, I got it.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.321
Let me take one of you.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.659
- You think so?
- Yeah, I like it.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.006
Now you're my prisoner.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.589
Really?

17:25.752 --> 17:27.925
- Does that mean I'm in trouble?
- Big trouble.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.229
What?
What does that mean?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.689
- It means that you...
- Yeah?

17:40.852 --> 17:42.570
- ...your friend...
- My friend?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.777
- ...and I...
- Uh-huh.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.534
No way, Jose.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.661
Not with that one.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.290
Mmm.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.562
Ooh!

19:07.230 --> 19:09.278
Oh my God.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.535
You'll wake her up.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.866
- Shh.
- Shh.

19:15.029 --> 19:17.031
Silencio, por favor.

19:31.629 --> 19:32.846
Let's go to my place.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.007
Your place?
No no no. We can't.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.142
Who says?

19:37.301 --> 19:38.769
- Me says.
- Oh, you says?

19:38.928 --> 19:40.601
Yeah, me...

19:42.306 --> 19:44.934
- Come on, you're gonna love it.
- I know I'll love it.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.572
I know.
I just can't.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.073
My friend, she's in...

19:51.232 --> 19:52.609
she's inside.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.324
Well, tell her to come.
Tell her to come.

19:55.486 --> 19:56.999
I'm not gonna tell her to come.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.664
Come on.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.669
I live really close to here.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.000
- I don't... we can't.
- Okay?

20:05.162 --> 20:07.256
- I told you I can't go.
- Come on, you're coming with me.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.713
I'm not gonna come with you.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.378
Okay, all right.
This hurts.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.013
Ow, stop!
What the hell?

20:14.171 --> 20:15.684
- Hey!
- Let me go!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.308
- Get away from me!
- Come inside!

20:17.466 --> 20:18.854
- Hey hey!
- Steph.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.980
Come on, we are just having--

20:22.138 --> 20:24.937
Keep 'em closed.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.774
He's mean. Oh!

20:33.941 --> 20:37.036
- What? Habla la bamba?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.947
Girls, open the goddamn door!

20:40.114 --> 20:43.368
- Ooh.
- Jesus, you trying to get us killed?

20:43.534 --> 20:45.832
- Ellie, come outside.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.872
Ellie!

20:49.707 --> 20:52.130
Hey, asshole.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.102
Qué pasa?

21:07.975 --> 21:10.069
Qué pasa?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.083
Sorry, girls.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.209
Maybe next time, all right?

21:28.162 --> 21:29.755
You too.

21:49.684 --> 21:51.778
Hey, Steph.

21:51.936 --> 21:55.156
You saved me.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.473
Aw shit. Ellie, get up.
We're late.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.511
Oh, no no no no.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.805
Oh no.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.393
I’m not kidding, El.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.354
- We cannot miss that bus.
- Oh no.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.029
Wait!

22:32.184 --> 22:33.697
Don't leave us here!

22:33.853 --> 22:35.776
Wait!

22:35.938 --> 22:37.656
No!

22:46.365 --> 22:48.163
Oh, we're screwed.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.329
- We'll just take the next bus.
- There is no next bus.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.793
Oh yeah.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.425
Why did this have to happen
to us on the last day?

22:56.584 --> 22:58.882
Everything was going so great
until now.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.342
Come on, let's go back.

23:09.346 --> 23:13.396
So that's flight 206
at 1600 hours.

23:13.559 --> 23:16.108
Um, that's 4:00 PM, right?

23:16.270 --> 23:18.819
Okay. No, that's fine.
Thank you.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.575
- Thank you, bye.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.077
Are we good?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.203
No, Ellie, we're not good.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.035
We're both out 200 bucks.

23:28.866 --> 23:32.416
Oh my gosh.
Wake me up never.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.127
Come on, let's at least
do something fun.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.041
I am doing something fun.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.013
You have not left.

23:43.172 --> 23:46.927
Oh no.
Actually, we missed our bus.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.438
But we wanted to go to this place...
Villa Del Lago.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.439
Have you heard of it?

23:55.392 --> 23:58.066
They say the water there
can cure polio.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.731
I don't have polio.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.741
Villa Del Lago.

24:02.900 --> 24:06.200
No, it's a ghost town now.
There is nothing to see.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.866
If you must go somewhere,

24:10.032 --> 24:14.128
go to see the waterfalls
or to see the caves.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.630
- They are beautiful.
- That sounds like fun.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.297
Ellie.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.554
All right, well, thank you.
Thank you. That's great.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.275
Rosa.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.787
- Permiso, chicas.
- Thanks.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.164
- Come on.
- Huh-uh.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.955
- Come on, Ellie, let's go.
- Huh-uh, no!

24:58.122 --> 24:59.465
Wake up.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.422
Dude, stop!

25:26.400 --> 25:28.698
Oh, look at that.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.010
Wow.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.303
Hey, let's just lay out here.

26:31.465 --> 26:34.218
- Ellie, really?
- Come on, just relax.

26:34.385 --> 26:36.513
We really don't have
anywhere to be.

26:39.682 --> 26:40.934
You win.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.089
Here, sunshine.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.966
It will all be okay.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.219
I promise.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.262
Thanks, El.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.310
- All right.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.907
# I'm feeling blind #

27:34.069 --> 27:36.663
# Like the sun's in my eyes #

27:36.822 --> 27:39.200
# Since I'm fighting in a losing war #

27:39.366 --> 27:43.917
# Tiny little fault lines
cracking inside my soul... #

27:51.962 --> 27:55.262
# I'm alive... #

28:00.763 --> 28:02.765
You ready?

28:04.475 --> 28:06.694
Ellie, I know you can hear me.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.401
- Let's go.
- Huh-uh, later.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.410
And when exactly is later?

28:14.568 --> 28:16.741
I don't know, Steph.
When I'm ready.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.460
Ow! What the hell?
I said I'm not ready.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.713
Well, I am.
El, we can’t be here all day.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.626
You really really need to learn
to have some fun.

28:29.792 --> 28:32.511
And what,
you're gonna teach me, I suppose?

28:32.669 --> 28:35.673
Yeah, actually.
I probably could.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.841
Where would we start, huh?

28:38.008 --> 28:40.557
The men's bathroom?
That sounds like fun.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.356
Okay.
No, that's great.

28:44.515 --> 28:45.767
I see where this is going.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.027
- Forget it.
- No.

28:48.185 --> 28:51.189
Forget it. No, you're right.
If you didn't care before attacking him

28:51.355 --> 28:53.153
in the bathroom, you're certainly
not gonna care now.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.943
Okay, Steph, I'm sorry.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.865
If it's any consolation,
he didn't take the bait.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.576
It's still really shitty, Ellie.

29:06.495 --> 29:09.374
- I guess you can't help it.
- What?

29:09.540 --> 29:12.840
You know what? I probably actually
should have done something.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.345
Because God knows
you never would have.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.972
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

29:17.131 --> 29:19.179
You know what?
Just-- just forget about it.

29:19.341 --> 29:23.016
No, bullshit forget it.
Say what you mean.

29:23.178 --> 29:26.603
I mean, Steph, God forbid you take
a chance on another guy

29:26.765 --> 29:29.393
instead of dwelling
on the same old one.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.983
He said we’d work it out, El.

29:32.146 --> 29:33.739
Stephanie, he cheated on you.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.320
This is crazy to me that
you're still defending him.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.872
You should have dumped
that guy right on the spot.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.200
But you didn't.
And now you're hurt

29:41.363 --> 29:45.118
and I have to pick up your pieces
of yet another disaster relationship.

29:45.284 --> 29:48.163
What? Is this coming
from you, the expert?

29:48.328 --> 29:51.172
You think a relationship is when
you get the guy's last name.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.209
Wow.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.753
You know what?
Screw you.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.671
Nice.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.105
Steph, wait.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.891
Where are you going?

30:09.057 --> 30:12.106
What do you care?
You're on vacation, Ellie.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.442
I don't want you to have to worry
about cleaning up after me.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.107
Have fun.

32:06.049 --> 32:09.053
Come on, El, where are you?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.382
Oh my--

35:45.936 --> 35:47.609
So it's me.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.444
Um, where are you?

35:49.606 --> 35:51.700
I'm at the cow place now.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.953
Um, okay.
So call me.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.159
Bye.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.225
Hey'

36:25.392 --> 36:27.440
- Hi.
- Where's your friend?

36:27.602 --> 36:29.070
Coming.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.160
Any minute now.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.708
Oh hey, thanks for your help
last night with that guy.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.663
- He was a real creep.
- Yeah, he was.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.461
You know what?
Probably got a flat or something.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.547
I'd better go.
But see you around, uh...

36:51.710 --> 36:53.838
- Michael.
- Stephanie.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.019
Hey, where are you going?
I'll give you a lift.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.557
No, I'm okay.
Thanks though.

37:05.515 --> 37:07.688
Wait! No!

37:08.685 --> 37:11.564
Somebody! No!

37:14.065 --> 37:15.453
No!

38:12.582 --> 38:14.505
Hey'

38:16.962 --> 38:18.134
You follow me here?

38:18.296 --> 38:21.891
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.890
Are you?
'Cause you don't look it.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.317
Her bike is gone.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.819
Well...

38:34.104 --> 38:35.447
Well, maybe she left already.

38:35.605 --> 38:37.448
No, there's only one road.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.860
I mean, we would have
passed each other.

38:40.026 --> 38:42.324
Right.

38:42.487 --> 38:45.912
I'm gonna go inside
and look for her.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.416
Are you sure this is the place?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.961
- Yeah, I'm positive.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.641
Do you hear that?

39:03.800 --> 39:06.053
- It's over here somewhere.
- Ellie!

39:43.757 --> 39:45.680
Who are you calling?

39:45.842 --> 39:48.561
The police.

39:49.679 --> 39:52.228
Good luck with that.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.223
- Hola.
- Hola.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.726
- Michael.
- Calvo.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.736
- What did he say?
- We're gonna show him.

41:04.796 --> 41:07.640
Here, give me the phone.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.427
Calvo.

41:39.956 --> 41:41.503
- What did he just ask?
- He asked...

41:41.666 --> 41:44.294
Why were you and your friend
not together?

41:46.129 --> 41:47.472
We got separated.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.304
Separated?
How did you get separated?

41:50.466 --> 41:52.810
It was stupid.
We got in a fight.

41:52.969 --> 41:54.471
Oh.

41:54.637 --> 41:57.561
Well, I am sure she will forgive you.

41:57.724 --> 41:59.772
Wait, where are you going?

41:59.934 --> 42:01.231
Your friend is fine.

42:01.394 --> 42:05.115
When she realizes she has lost her
phone she will come back to find it.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.321
Senor, please wait.
Where are you going?

42:07.483 --> 42:09.656
Calvo.

42:09.819 --> 42:11.412
Michael.

42:15.575 --> 42:18.499
Do yourself a favor
and find another lover.

42:18.661 --> 42:21.665
This one has a habit
of losing his girlfriends.

42:24.834 --> 42:28.008
Hey. Hey!

42:28.171 --> 42:31.425
I am very sorry, but I...

42:31.591 --> 42:33.593
She was with a guy last night.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.013
What did he look like?

42:36.179 --> 42:38.273
He was tall.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.354
He had brown hair.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.655
Brown hair?

42:42.810 --> 42:46.189
You just described half
of Argentina.

42:46.356 --> 42:48.859
- Did you get his name?
- No, I didn't.

42:49.025 --> 42:51.995
- Could you identify him?
- Yeah.

42:52.153 --> 42:55.123
Yeah, if I saw him again
I'm sure I could.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.704
Well, when you do see him
you can call me,

42:57.867 --> 42:59.995
but now there is nothing I can do.

43:01.537 --> 43:04.336
Please. Please.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.593
Okay.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.549
You may make a report if you want.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.260
Yeah, that...
thank you.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.222
Can I ride with you?

43:17.053 --> 43:19.226
- Of course.
- Okay.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.142
You want me to come with you?

43:22.308 --> 43:23.776
No, Michael.
Thank you.

43:23.935 --> 43:26.734
I think I can handle
the situation from here.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.819
Yeah, I'll be fine.

44:03.349 --> 44:07.195
Just because he speaks English
does not mean you should trust him.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.614
I don't know if I trust
anybody right now.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.651
All done.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.942
Wait, that's it?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.531
- That's it.
- No.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.038
We should be out there
looking for her.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.666
I mean, we can still make
a search party before it gets dark.

45:01.824 --> 45:03.497
A search party?

45:03.659 --> 45:07.004
Where do you think you are?
This is not America.

45:07.163 --> 45:10.383
Does it look like I can
make a search party?

45:12.168 --> 45:14.170
Then what else can we do?

45:14.337 --> 45:17.511
Today? Nothing.

45:17.673 --> 45:19.061
Nothing?

45:19.217 --> 45:23.643
Please, you should not
worry so much.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.853
Your friend is just having her fun.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.313
My friend is not out there
having fun, okay?

45:28.476 --> 45:30.854
I know her.

45:31.020 --> 45:33.523
She wouldn't just leave me like this.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.159
The way you left her alone
in a foreign country?

45:42.073 --> 45:43.666
I'm sorry.

45:45.576 --> 45:48.250
I will do everything in my power.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.211
You have my word.

45:50.373 --> 45:53.047
This is so messed up.

45:55.044 --> 45:57.046
Is there someone else I can talk to?

45:57.213 --> 45:59.841
You're tired.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.602
Why don't you go back to the hotel
and take a siesta?

46:05.221 --> 46:08.395
You want me to take a nap
while my best friend is missing?

46:08.558 --> 46:12.108
Yes.
I think you will feel much better.

46:14.355 --> 46:17.484
It's okay.
Look, if she's not back tomorrow,

46:17.650 --> 46:20.995
we'll file a missing persons report
with federal police in Buenos Aires.

46:21.154 --> 46:22.576
Okay?

46:25.408 --> 46:26.910
Okay.

46:27.076 --> 46:28.919
Good.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.103
Everything will be all right.
You'll see.

47:16.209 --> 47:19.179
Disculpe me.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.845
Uh...

47:24.842 --> 47:26.970
I'm looking for my friend.

47:27.136 --> 47:29.855
Senora.
I'm just looking for my friend.

47:30.014 --> 47:32.938
Mi amiga. Senora?

47:56.749 --> 47:59.343
Oh, excuse me.
Can you help me?

47:59.502 --> 48:02.176
I'm looking for my friend.
I can't find her.

48:02.338 --> 48:05.342
Senora?
I just want to ask...

48:05.508 --> 48:07.510
- I just...

48:11.764 --> 48:14.893
Senora, please.

48:19.313 --> 48:22.192
Hey, wait.

48:22.358 --> 48:23.735
Hey!

48:23.901 --> 48:26.245
I just want to talk to you.

48:43.045 --> 48:44.513
Wait.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.343
Hey!

50:04.960 --> 50:07.008
Ellie?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.904
Hello?

50:32.071 --> 50:33.994
- Michael?

51:09.859 --> 51:12.738
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

51:19.285 --> 51:21.708
Look what I found.
It was in his room.

51:21.871 --> 51:23.873
- It's Ellie's.
- Whose room?

51:24.039 --> 51:25.211
Michael's.

51:27.543 --> 51:30.513
Okay.

51:30.671 --> 51:32.048
I will question him,

51:32.214 --> 51:35.309
but only if you go
back to the hotel and wait for me.

51:35.468 --> 51:38.597
You let me do my job.
Is that fair?

51:44.226 --> 51:46.399
- Okay.
- Good.

52:03.913 --> 52:05.915
What's wrong?

52:07.416 --> 52:08.838
Ellie's gone.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.719
Gone?

52:12.630 --> 52:16.100
We got in a fight
and I went on without her.

52:21.806 --> 52:24.104
I've got to--
I've got to find her.

52:24.266 --> 52:27.395
Come inside.
Have something to drink.

52:31.065 --> 52:33.193
Come on.
it's okay.

52:33.359 --> 52:35.077
Come on.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.524
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine.

56:51.533 --> 56:52.750
Hey'

56:52.910 --> 56:54.127
- Please don't! No!
- Just wait!

56:54.286 --> 56:56.709
- No, let me go!
- Hey! I won't hurt you.

56:56.872 --> 56:58.920
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop, no! Stop it!

56:59.083 --> 57:01.427
- Get off me!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

57:03.253 --> 57:05.221
What's the matter with you?

57:11.428 --> 57:13.772
Where did you get this?

57:13.931 --> 57:15.808
You went through my things?

57:15.974 --> 57:18.648
Where did you get this?

57:18.811 --> 57:20.688
Look, it belongs to someone I know.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.948
Bullshit!
This is Ellie's.

57:24.358 --> 57:25.951
What did you do with her?

57:26.110 --> 57:30.832
Look, I swear to God I've got nothing
to do with your friend, okay?

57:30.989 --> 57:32.662
You have to trust me.
Look.

57:32.825 --> 57:35.453
Look, please.
Would you just take a look at this?

57:35.619 --> 57:38.088
Okay?
Just take a look at it.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.976
Her name is Camila.

57:48.132 --> 57:50.351
She disappeared
somewhere around here.

57:50.509 --> 57:54.184
That's her bracelet.

57:55.931 --> 57:59.981
I've been up and down these roads
100 times looking for her.

58:03.147 --> 58:05.115
Oh God.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.578
I'm so sorry.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.454
I'm sorry.

58:15.450 --> 58:17.953
You know, when we met
she was organizing

58:18.120 --> 58:20.839
a humanitarian mission
to South America.

58:20.998 --> 58:25.799
And I wanted to be with her
so I went too.

58:25.961 --> 58:28.339
What happened?

58:31.216 --> 58:33.935
About six months ago
we came to work here.

58:34.094 --> 58:37.394
One day she took the truck
into town to get some supplies

58:37.556 --> 58:40.184
and that's the last I saw of her.

58:40.350 --> 58:42.068
Nobody knows what happened.

58:42.227 --> 58:45.071
And if they do,
they're not saying anything.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.904
I'd do anything to get her back.

58:49.443 --> 58:51.866
And I'm not leaving this country
until I find her.

58:52.029 --> 58:54.828
Did you call the police?

58:54.990 --> 58:56.833
Calvo?

58:56.992 --> 58:59.666
Yeah, he filled out a form.

58:59.828 --> 59:01.751
Oh no.

59:01.914 --> 59:03.837
God.

59:03.999 --> 59:07.253
I'm gonna be sick.

59:10.756 --> 59:13.179
Oh God.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.471
I can't....

59:17.638 --> 59:19.857
Look, I've been hearing things

59:20.015 --> 59:22.985
about young women, girls,
who've been abducted

59:23.143 --> 59:25.441
and taken across the river
into Paraguay.

59:25.604 --> 59:28.483
I don't know if that's what's
happened to your friend.

59:28.649 --> 59:31.368
I mean, it's rare.
it's risky to kidnap an American.

59:31.526 --> 59:33.620
But it does happen.

59:33.779 --> 59:35.656
That's why I tried to warn her.

59:35.822 --> 59:37.665
Oh.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.667
I have to find her.

59:39.826 --> 59:41.214
I have to find Ellie.

59:41.370 --> 59:42.963
Okay.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.465
Well, I mean, chances are
she's probably still in the area.

59:45.624 --> 59:47.752
It's too risky to move her
during daylight.

59:47.918 --> 59:50.341
But we need to find her
before it gets dark.

59:50.504 --> 59:53.633
- How?
- We need to split up.

59:53.799 --> 59:55.676
Now I'll understand if you
don't want to do that.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.765
But we can cover more ground
if you do.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.608
No, you're right.
You're right.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.940
Okay, I'll meet you back here
in an hour.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.571
Yeah.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.248
Ellie!

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.494
Ellie!

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.206
Ellie!

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:11.710
Ellie!

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:13.526
- Oh shit.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:21.955
Michael, you're becoming
a hard man to find.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:25.084
Surely you must be lost.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:28.086
You know me,
just seeing the sights.

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.918
Yes, of course you are.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.174
Have you seen Stephanie?

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.130
No.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:36.556
Because a car has been stolen

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.260
and that does not happen
very often around here.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.051
Wow.
A stolen car.

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:46.221
Did you find Stephanie's friend?

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:49.392
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.112
So her friend is still missing

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.115
and you're looking for a car?

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:03.447
Okay.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.366
Come with me.
Let's take a drive.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:21.889
Water.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.612
Chucho,

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:24.995
I know you're not a bad guy.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.334
I can tell by the way
you kissed me.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.127
Come here and kiss me again.

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:40.715
Come here.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:51.892
Come here.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.898
So you want that?

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.525
I want you.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:03.859
No!

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.288
Help!

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:08.868
- Hey hey.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.032
No!

01:05:11.199 --> 01:05:13.076
Oh my God!

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:16.413
-Don't! No!

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.379
Bastard !

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.919
Shh.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.557
You fucking bastard.

01:05:30.218 --> 01:05:32.061
Help me!

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:24.606
Stop it!

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.195
Fuck you!

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.284
Oh God, get me out of here, please.

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:41.214
Well, seems that tonight is your night.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.984
Listen.

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:04.396
Don't you move, okay?

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:02.705
Steph. Hurry hurry.

01:08:02.871 --> 01:08:04.794
- Ellie. Ellie, are you okay?
- Steph.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:06.503
- Are you okay?
- I just want to go home.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.543
- Let's go home.
- We're gonna go home.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.308
Shh Shh.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:15.721
- Get this off me.
- Hold still.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.109
- You can do it, right?
- Oh, he's coming!

01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.488
- Shit. Come on. Come on.
- Hey!

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:30.740
Hey!

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:37.787
Let's go!

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.279
- Ellie, come on. Hurry hurry.
- Go, go.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.658
Lock it! Lock it!

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:21.950
- Oh God! Oh God!
- Go, Steph, now. Come on, go.

01:09:22.951 --> 01:09:24.703
- Oh shit.
- Get it! Get it!

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:26.792
- Shit.
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:28.752
Okay okay okay.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:30.542
Open the door.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:35.305
- Steph, watch out!
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:40.477
Come on, come on!

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:47.729
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:49.484
Where'd he go?

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.317
Shh.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:56.484
- No!

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:00.871
Watch out!

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:14.555
Wait, stop!

01:10:21.593 --> 01:10:24.847
Ellie. Ellie.
Oh my God.

01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:27.482
Oh my God.
Ellie, come on.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.642
Oh my God.

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.686
Ellie, please. Ellie!

01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:34.527
Ellie!

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.786
Ellie!

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:42.993
Ellie!

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:45.625
Hey, get off of her!

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:48.081
- Ellie.

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.881
Ellie, please.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.042
Ellie.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.711
She's dead!

01:10:56.878 --> 01:10:59.757
She's dead!

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:06.482
Oh my God.

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:11.105
Stephanie, is this the man

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.564
you say was with your friend
the other night?

01:11:12.727 --> 01:11:16.072
- Yes!
- Stephanie, get into the truck.

01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:20.739
It's for your safety.
Trust me.

01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.904
Now!

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.748
Oh my God.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:43.007
She was very desirable.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.926
What a waste.

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.610
"Assport"?
Clever.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.021
That's a good one.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:06.081
Michael!
it's him, Michael!

01:12:06.239 --> 01:12:09.368
- Michael!
- But that one

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:12.959
will do fine in her place,
don't you think?

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.259
- Michael.
- Shut up.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:25.642
Get away from the car.
Where is she?

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:31.476
Just put the gun down.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.312
Where's Camila?

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:35.772
Michael, we can still
help each other.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:38.859
- But you must put the gun down.
- On your knees.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:47.531
Shut up!
On your knees.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.580
Think for a second.

01:12:55.747 --> 01:12:59.672
If you kill me then who will tell you
where to find Camila?

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.976
Just put the gun down
and let's talk, okay? Man to man.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:11.354
I think we can work out something
that will satisfy us both.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:14.186
- Where is she?
- She's safe. Trust me.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.521
- Where is she?

01:13:20.855 --> 01:13:24.359
I swear to you no harm
has come to her.

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:28.739
Okay.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:33.160
I can bring her to you,
but we must trade.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.538
You piece of shit.

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.209
This is the only way.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:44.379
Stephanie for Camila.

01:13:55.556 --> 01:13:57.433
It's simple, Michael.

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:00.695
Stephanie for Camila.

01:14:17.078 --> 01:14:18.421
No.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:23.676
I'm sorry.

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.633
Michael, no!

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:09.301
I hope you're going
to be a good girl

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:12.091
and play nice.

01:15:12.258 --> 01:15:13.931
'Cause if you give me any trouble,

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:17.518
I swear I will cut you so bad

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.901
you will not even make $10 per day
sucking cock in the streets.

01:15:26.564 --> 01:15:28.032
Please.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:34.702
What if I told you that you
are only worth $2,000?

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:37.617
$6,000 if you're a virgin, but--

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:42.758
are you a virgin?

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:47.502
Get away!
Stop it!

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:51.514
Stop. No.
No, I don't think you're a virgin.

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:02.816
Please.
I'm sorry.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.398
Don't worry, you're American,

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.188
not some brown peasant.

01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:09.949
You're worth much more.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:45.147
It's lucky for you my partner
across the river is open-minded.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.062
You see, he is a businessman too.

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:51.449
And they think you could
make a nice accessory

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.405
for one of his clients.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.704
Night night.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.988
- Get up.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:23.994
I should kill you.

01:20:24.153 --> 01:20:26.281
Then you would owe me
a lot of money.

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:27.790
Pick her up.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:35.960
- I don't like this.
- What's not to like?

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.376
- This is what we discussed.
- This is dangerous.

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:41.637
Girls like her--
people will look for her.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.672
Then put her someplace
no one will find her.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.513
So easy for you.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.305
Please.
Please.

01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:54.983
Your greed is going
to get you killed one day.

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:56.735
And you,

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:59.864
you'd better be worth the trouble.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.320
Never!

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:43.528
Help! Help!

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.704
Help, somebody!
Help!

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.122
Please!

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:00.087
Please wake up!

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.718
Please help me.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:05.880
Help me, please! Help me!

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:38.199
Stephanie, please.
Give me the gun.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:44.205
Come on.
Be a good girl.

01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:47.375
Just give me the gun!

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:26.231
it's okay.
it's okay.

01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:44.177
# When I woke this morning #

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:49.520
# I saw that you were still gone #

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:52.434
# And just for the weekend #

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:56.526
# Just sayin' I think
that's way too long #

01:27:56.688 --> 01:28:00.238
# I toss in these sweaty sheets,
no sleep #

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.780
# The clock is wailing on and on
and on and on #

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:08.668
# Who in the hell was I
to come here #

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:12.295
# All alone
on my own? #

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.206
# But you you you #

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:15.966
# I love you #

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.754
# More than I ever wanted to #

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.093
# It's all I am #

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:25.509
# All I do is sit around #

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:27.599
# And remember you #

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:33.439
# I'm on my knees now #

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:37.651
# Please turn around
and come home #

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:43.035
# I left my cold soul
on the ground #

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:55.794
# I can't believe I'm falling apart #

01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:59.426
# I need your needle in my arm #

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:03.464
# 10cc might suit me #

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:06.804
# I'd rather all day
than go without #

01:29:06.967 --> 01:29:09.015
# Your arms #

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:14.149
# I'm drying up
without this cocoon #

01:29:14.307 --> 01:29:18.232
# Well, I want to be your monarch #

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:22.320
# Pin me up to the wall
in your bedroom #

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:25.827
# But you you you,
I love you #

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:29.786
# More than I ever wanted to #

01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:31.996
# It's all I am #

01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:35.333
# All I do is sit around #

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:37.372
# And remember you #

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:43.546
# I'm on my knees now #

01:29:44.921 --> 01:29:47.515
# Please turn around
and come home #

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:52.771
# I left my cold soul
on the ground #

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:08.987
# I'm all alone #

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.290
# I'm all alone #

01:30:12.449 --> 01:30:14.076
# I'm on my knees #

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.960
# I'm all alone #

01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:17.871
# I'm begging you #

01:30:18.038 --> 01:30:21.383
# Come back to me #

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.761
# Come back
to me #

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:31.677
# I'm on my knees now... #

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:36.602
# Please turn around
and come home #

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:41.737
# I left my cold soul
on the ground #

01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:46.321
# Come home, come home #

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.110
# Come home #

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:50.665
# Don't leave me here #

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:56.919
# Please, turn around. #
