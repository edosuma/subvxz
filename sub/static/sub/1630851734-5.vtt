THE WATCHER: <i>The galaxy.</i>

00:04.212 --> 00:07.173
<i>To your eyes,</i>
<i>a hundred billion points of light.</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:09.634
<i>But where you see light,</i>

00:09.718 --> 00:14.014
<i>I see worlds</i>
<i>and the countless stories that fill them.</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:17.600
<i>What you call destiny is just an equation.</i>

00:18.268 --> 00:22.063
<i>The product of variables,</i>
<i>right place, right time,</i>

00:22.147 --> 00:27.360
<i>or in some instances,</i>
<i>the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:32.824
<i>What if one choice changed everything?</i>

00:34.826 --> 00:39.748
<i>What if every reality</i>
<i>came down to one single moment?</i>

00:40.957 --> 00:46.588
Join me. Explore the multiverse
and ask the question,

00:46.671 --> 00:48.089
"What if...?"

00:49.424 --> 00:50.550
MAN: Perfect. Thank you.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.936
KEVIN FEIGE: <i>We were looking at</i>
<i>how to grow, how to expand,</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:05.857
<i>how to evolve post</i> Endgame
<i>and into Phase Four.</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:10.820
And we had tons of ideas
for features and for follow-ups

01:10.904 --> 01:13.698
to existing characters,
and introducing new characters.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.367
But it was Disney Plus
and the idea of Disney Plus

01:16.451 --> 01:19.996
that really allowed us
to do things we hadn't done before.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.415
<i>We had to think what ideas</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:25.376
<i>are worth doing in animation</i>
<i>that we couldn't do anywhere else.</i>

01:26.044 --> 01:28.630
<i>And it was Brad Winderbaum</i>
<i>who came into my office and said,</i>

01:29.464 --> 01:31.132
<i>"What about doing a</i> What If...?"

01:31.216 --> 01:33.009
"We have so many fans now,

01:33.093 --> 01:36.096
"we have so many people that have watched
our movies multiple times,

01:36.179 --> 01:39.182
"everybody knows how things happen,

01:39.265 --> 01:42.352
<i>"how Iron Man became Iron Man,</i>
<i>how Cap became Cap,"</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.104
<i>that the</i> What If...? <i>series from comics</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:47.774
<i>was always such a great way</i>
<i>of putting a spin on it.</i>

01:52.153 --> 01:54.656
<i>What If...?</i> as a concept
and as a comic book

01:54.739 --> 01:57.534
is something that would
always come up in conversation.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.495
Uh, I can think back
to the earliest retreats.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.705
<i>We would think about</i> What If...?

02:02.831 --> 02:06.709
<i>just in terms</i>
<i>of not necessarily adapting it,</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:09.712
<i>but how many great stories</i>
<i>came out of the comic book.</i>

02:10.672 --> 02:13.133
<i>And how so many of those stories</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:14.551
<i>actually became canon</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:18.888
<i>within the main continuity</i>
<i>of the Marvel Comics universe.</i>

02:27.313 --> 02:29.315
<i>Speaking from my own personal experience,</i>

02:29.399 --> 02:32.235
<i>and this is something</i>
<i>that other people have said as well,</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:34.279
What If...? <i>was a bit of a gateway</i>

02:34.362 --> 02:37.782
<i>to different comics</i>
<i>you won't normally pick up.</i>

02:37.866 --> 02:39.659
You know, I loved <i>Ghost Rider</i> growing up,

02:39.742 --> 02:41.578
and I think
the first <i>Ghost Rider</i> I picked up

02:41.661 --> 02:47.458
was the "What if Danny Ketch's sister
became Ghost Rider instead of him?"

02:47.542 --> 02:49.085
<i>Then I was like, "This is awesome!"</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:52.338
And then I'd read all that Danny Ketch,
Ghost Rider run. You know?

02:52.422 --> 02:56.092
And I think a lot of people
had a similar experience of <i>What If...?</i>

02:56.176 --> 03:00.430
<i>It introduced you to characters</i>
<i>you wouldn't normally read.</i>

03:00.513 --> 03:03.641
<i>In kind of abstracting them,</i>
<i>it made them new.</i>

03:03.725 --> 03:06.019
<i>So there was a lower barrier of entry.</i>

03:06.102 --> 03:08.021
<i>You didn't feel like you needed to read</i>

03:08.104 --> 03:11.149
<i>the 60 comics leading</i>
<i>up to that one storyline.</i>

03:11.232 --> 03:15.445
<i>It was its own unique thing</i>
<i>that you could experience as a newcomer.</i>

03:20.074 --> 03:22.493
I remember when I was a kid,
getting some of the comics

03:22.577 --> 03:25.455
and whether it's like,
you know, Conan in New York...

03:25.538 --> 03:28.458
<i>with Howard the Duck,</i>
<i>or, you know, crazy stuff.</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:33.171
<i>It was almost like</i>
<i>it was Marvel's</i> Twilight Zone <i>of the time.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:36.382
And I think its heyday was really
in the '70s, a little bit in the '80s.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.260
It still has gone on, but those
were the ones to really remember.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.474
<i>I think it was a testing ground</i>
<i>for certain stories,</i>

03:44.557 --> 03:47.936
certain possible ways they can possibly go
with various characters,

03:48.019 --> 03:51.898
you know, trying it out, you know,
safely in this little one-off comic.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.567
<i>And then if it struck a chord,</i>
<i>they can run with it.</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:57.153
<i>So, for example, like,</i>
<i>"What if the Hulk was smart?"</i>

03:57.237 --> 04:00.198
<i>and that eventually</i>
<i>became a whole storyline of its own with,</i>

04:00.281 --> 04:02.242
<i>like, Smart Hulk and all this business.</i>

04:02.325 --> 04:06.871
And that's happened with, actually,
quite a few of the <i>What If...?</i> titles.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.541
So, um, there is a lineage there,
but for our show,

04:10.625 --> 04:13.294
we're not borrowing anything
that was pre-done in the comic.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.089
<i>We just came up with new stuff,</i>

04:16.172 --> 04:19.926
<i>since it's born directly</i>
<i>out of the MCU specifically.</i>

04:20.009 --> 04:24.806
<i>So we're not just riffing</i>
<i>on the comic characters per se,</i>

04:24.889 --> 04:29.560
<i>we're riffing on the Marvel movie</i>
<i>cinematic version of those characters.</i>

04:29.644 --> 04:31.020
Whoa.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.231
I got visual on the intruder.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.776
He's a Caucasian male, mid-20s with...

04:38.861 --> 04:40.530
really great hair.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.824
Excuse me?

04:45.493 --> 04:47.537
WINDERBAUM:
<i>We had been working with Bryan Andrews</i>

04:47.620 --> 04:49.372
<i>for many years at Marvel Studios.</i>

04:49.455 --> 04:54.127
<i>He had boarded</i>
<i>some of our most iconic action sequences.</i>

04:55.336 --> 04:57.922
<i>I worked with him on</i> Ant-Man 1
<i>when he designed</i>

04:58.006 --> 04:59.340
<i>Scott Lang's first descent into</i>

04:59.424 --> 05:01.217
<i>the quantum realm</i>
<i>at the end of that movie.</i>

05:01.301 --> 05:04.971
And he had taken a big hand most recently

05:05.054 --> 05:10.226
as part of the story room
that cracked the finale of <i>Endgame,</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:13.896
<i>which was a combination of storyboard</i>
<i>artists and Chris and Steve, the writers.</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:17.567
<i>And frankly,</i>
<i>when I pitched</i> What If...? <i>to Kevin,</i>

05:17.650 --> 05:19.444
<i>and things were happening so fast,</i>

05:19.527 --> 05:22.905
I just called Bryan, who I knew, and said,

05:22.989 --> 05:26.200
"Hey, dude,
do you wanna work on this together?"

05:26.284 --> 05:27.493
(CHUCKLES)

05:27.577 --> 05:31.372
And his response was,
"Well, yeah, man, of course."

05:31.456 --> 05:34.751
ANDREWS: <i>You know, my brothers and I</i>
<i>grew up loving all kinds of animation,</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:37.003
<i>but we also grew up loving Marvel.</i>

05:37.086 --> 05:39.881
I mean, we had
<i>How To Draw The Marvel Way,</i> you know?

05:39.964 --> 05:43.718
We were huge fans of the paintings
of Frank Frazetta and the rest of it.

05:43.801 --> 05:47.930
But it's all in that
same kind of action-y, adventure,

05:48.014 --> 05:50.975
you know, bigger-than-life mythos stuff,

05:51.059 --> 05:54.187
and the Marvel comics
were definitely an inspiration, you know.

05:54.270 --> 05:58.608
<i>Certain artists</i>
<i>would rise above others in our minds,</i>

05:58.691 --> 06:02.028
<i>whether it's, like, you know,</i>
<i>Kirby, or...</i> (INHALES) <i>or whoever else.</i>

06:02.111 --> 06:04.739
<i>It's like there're certain</i>
<i>artists that just captured</i>

06:04.822 --> 06:07.408
<i>your imagination in those drawings,</i>
<i>in those panels.</i>

06:07.492 --> 06:10.495
<i>And, um, to think that</i>
<i>so many years later,</i>

06:11.204 --> 06:13.164
<i>working in</i>
<i>the live action stuff, it's like,</i>

06:13.247 --> 06:16.209
<i>"Oh, I used to draw all those characters</i>
<i>when I was a kid."</i>

06:16.292 --> 06:19.837
<i>But here I am, working on it now</i>
<i>for the Cinematic Universe,</i>

06:19.921 --> 06:23.132
<i>which is already kind of, like,</i>
<i>"Well, that's an amazing dream."</i>

06:23.216 --> 06:25.676
But then, now also
doing it in an animated show

06:25.760 --> 06:29.764
that's revisiting those characters,
and it's, like, that's like, "Wait, what?"

06:32.266 --> 06:33.684
<i>It's pretty amazing.</i>

06:36.687 --> 06:38.815
WINDERBAUM: <i>One of the interesting things</i>
<i>that happened</i>

06:38.898 --> 06:42.360
<i>in the development process</i>
<i>of</i> What If...? <i>is</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:46.739
<i>how many ideas just come up,</i>
<i>and we're still coming up with them.</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:50.410
You almost can't stop thinking about it.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.577
WONG: What are you doing?

06:51.661 --> 06:55.373
Tinkering with time can weaken
the very fabric of the universe.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.583
WINDERBAUM: <i>The key to the stories</i>
<i>that were chosen</i>

06:57.667 --> 06:59.877
<i>is that they were all</i>
<i>character-based stories,</i>

06:59.961 --> 07:01.796
<i>and they all drove at the human heart.</i>

07:01.879 --> 07:06.426
<i>Which is why we hired</i>
<i>Ashley Bradley as our EP</i>

07:06.509 --> 07:07.927
<i>and head writer of the show.</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:11.055
If you look at her work
on <i>Trollhunters</i> and <i>3Below,</i>

07:11.139 --> 07:14.183
you see a writer who,
no matter what the big,

07:14.267 --> 07:16.561
<i>crazy sci-fi circumstance is,</i>

07:16.644 --> 07:19.897
<i>is always trying to find</i>
<i>the core of the character</i>

07:19.981 --> 07:23.985
<i>and creates conflicts that really</i>
<i>challenge who those characters are.</i>

07:24.068 --> 07:26.487
And that's something
we always try to do in the movies,

07:26.571 --> 07:29.031
and each episode of <i>What If...?</i>
is gonna try to do.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.324
(GRUNTS)

07:30.408 --> 07:33.786
For a minute, I really thought
it was you and me against the world.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.414
We're not fighting the same battles, Tony.

07:37.498 --> 07:41.210
The first few weeks, it was basically
me and the other executive producers

07:41.294 --> 07:46.382
which is Brad Winderbaum
and Bryan Andrews. And it was... camp.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.718
<i>It was two weeks of</i>
<i>"What stories do we want to tell?"</i>

07:48.801 --> 07:50.261
<i>There's obvious ones.</i>

07:50.344 --> 07:53.764
<i>"What if Thor was never banished?"</i>
<i>"What if Ultron won?"</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:58.644
ULTRON: I'm going to bring about
peace in our time...

07:58.728 --> 08:02.356
BRADLEY:<i> And once we got those out of our</i>
<i>system, we started then playing more with</i>

08:02.440 --> 08:05.693
<i>"What if Yondu kidnapped</i>
<i>the wrong kid instead of Peter Quill?"</i>

08:05.776 --> 08:07.028
<i>What happens next?</i>

08:07.111 --> 08:09.280
Whatcha doing out there
all by yourself anyway?

08:09.363 --> 08:10.990
Exploring the world.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.450
Sounds fun.

08:12.533 --> 08:16.954
But why stop at one world, huh?
When we can show you all of them?

08:17.038 --> 08:20.541
WINDERBAUM:
<i>Once you realize what the show can be,</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:22.335
<i>it's almost impossible not to ideate.</i>

08:22.418 --> 08:27.882
<i>You just... Your brain just starts</i>
<i>to explore every corner of the universe.</i>

08:27.965 --> 08:29.592
That's something that made

08:29.675 --> 08:32.178
the whole development process
of this series so euphoric,

08:32.303 --> 08:34.472
was that you get in a room with people,

08:34.555 --> 08:37.600
and it was just idea,
idea, idea, idea, idea,

08:37.683 --> 08:40.811
'cause almost every event
could be reconceived

08:40.895 --> 08:44.690
<i>and remixed into</i>
<i>its own</i> What If...? <i>story.</i>

08:44.774 --> 08:50.029
<i>And we realized very quickly that</i>
<i>you could come up with a cool idea like,</i>

08:50.112 --> 08:55.409
<i>"Oh, what if Peggy Carter</i>
<i>got into the Project Rebirth chamber</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:57.703
<i>"and became a Super Soldier</i>
<i>instead of Steve Rogers?"</i>

08:57.787 --> 08:59.705
<i>But that was only the beginning.</i>

08:59.789 --> 09:02.625
It wasn't just "what if,"
it was also "then what?"

09:02.708 --> 09:05.211
<i>So every pitch that we came up with,</i>

09:05.294 --> 09:08.631
<i>every idea that we conceived of</i>
<i>had two parts.</i>

09:08.714 --> 09:11.592
It had the "what if," which was
essentially the inciting incident,

09:11.676 --> 09:14.095
and it had the, "then what,"
which is the actual story.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.304
What in heavens?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.682
<i>And as we developed</i>
<i>the stories in the series,</i>

09:17.765 --> 09:23.271
<i>the "then whats" became the real emotional</i>
<i>bedrock of the stories we were telling.</i>

09:23.354 --> 09:25.231
You're my hero, Steve.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.400
I mean, you're a hero.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.193
(CHUCKLES)

09:30.611 --> 09:31.779
Hmm.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.281
You're my hero, too.

09:33.364 --> 09:36.284
The heart of the characters
always has to remain the same.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.870
<i>If T'Challa is in Wakanda or chilling</i>
<i>with the Ravagers in outer space,</i>

09:39.954 --> 09:41.998
<i>he is always the once and future king.</i>

09:42.081 --> 09:44.625
Should we be bowing?
I feel like we should we bowing.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.627
I mean, unless we should be kneeling.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.713
-Neither is necessary.
-Please.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.716
BRADLEY:<i> It doesn't matter</i>
<i>where in the world Tony Stark is,</i>

09:51.799 --> 09:53.718
<i>Pepper Potts is his North Star.</i>

09:53.801 --> 09:57.597
Lot of people come around looking to get
their moment in the sun with Tony Stark,

09:57.680 --> 10:01.183
and it's my job to sniff out exactly
what it is they want with him.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.268
And what do you smell?

10:02.351 --> 10:04.186
Nothing. And that's the problem.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.524
BRADLEY: <i>Steve Rogers, whether</i>
<i>he's in his Captain America uniform,</i>

10:08.608 --> 10:10.651
<i>whether he's Skinny Steve or not,</i>

10:10.735 --> 10:14.071
<i>he will go to the ends of the earth</i>
<i>to do what he believes is right.</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:16.782
Hey, I need a hand! Come on,
help me get him out of here!

10:16.866 --> 10:19.285
No. You gotta get me in the suit.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.537
That's where we always kind of start with.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.414
Like, we go in different directions,

10:23.497 --> 10:26.042
but we stay true to the characters
as much as possible.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.793
THE WATCHER:
<i>I believe that in this universe,</i>

10:27.877 --> 10:30.379
<i>as in every other, hope never dies.</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
FEIGE: <i>One of the things</i>
<i>we're exploring in Phase Four,</i>

10:36.427 --> 10:38.471
<i>which we've talked about,</i>
<i>is the Multiverse.</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:41.766
<i>And</i> What If...? <i>as almost every episode</i>

10:41.849 --> 10:43.934
<i>is narrated by the character, the Watcher,</i>

10:44.018 --> 10:45.978
<i>a very important character in the comics</i>

10:46.062 --> 10:49.148
<i>that we've never really</i>
<i>seen much of in the MCU.</i>

10:49.231 --> 10:52.568
<i>Briefly, we saw some Watchers,</i>
<i>there's a little cameo with Stan Lee</i>

10:52.652 --> 10:54.236
<i>in</i> Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.198
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...

10:57.281 --> 10:59.950
We know the way it worked
in the movies we watched.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.162
<i>He's showing us</i>
<i>other ways it could have gone.</i>

11:03.245 --> 11:05.289
THE WATCHER:
<i>In a multiverse of infinite possibility,</i>

11:05.373 --> 11:08.209
<i>is your destiny determined by your nature</i>

11:08.292 --> 11:10.670
<i>or by the nature of your world?</i>

11:10.753 --> 11:12.922
We knew that we were gonna do the Watcher.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.216
<i>The Watcher is a big part of</i> What If...?

11:15.299 --> 11:19.553
<i>We needed this guide to help us</i>
<i>navigate these vast new realities.</i>

11:19.637 --> 11:24.100
And the voice we all heard in our head
was Jeffrey Wright from day one.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.685
I am the Watcher.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.145
Where humans see chaos,

11:28.229 --> 11:30.773
I see the crucible that would transform

11:30.856 --> 11:34.985
this collection of individuals
into a team of heroes.

11:35.069 --> 11:40.658
WRIGHT: <i>The Watcher kind of serves</i>
<i>as a Rod Serling to</i> The Twilight Zone.

11:40.741 --> 11:45.913
Kind of narrating the events,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.542
<i>but also a sometimes-passive-</i>
<i>sometimes-not participant.</i>

11:49.917 --> 11:51.711
Oh, you're so close.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.213
The answer is right there.

11:54.296 --> 12:00.511
WRIGHT: <i>The Watcher is a celestial,</i>
<i>extraterrestrial being.</i>

12:00.594 --> 12:03.764
And I think he was introduced,
if I'm not mistaken,

12:03.848 --> 12:06.767
in a <i>Fantastic Four</i> comic in 1963

12:06.851 --> 12:11.897
<i>where we discover him on the moon,</i>
<i>and he's introduced on the cover</i>

12:11.981 --> 12:15.776
<i>as "The Most Dramatic Being."</i>

12:15.860 --> 12:20.239
Humanity, so eager,
so willing to face the impossible,

12:20.322 --> 12:22.533
yet blind to the bigger picture.

12:22.616 --> 12:27.288
The language is very cool,
and it kind of sp...

12:27.371 --> 12:31.083
You know, it speaks to a certain tone.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.379
<i>He's obviously</i>
<i>got to have a kind of strength</i>

12:35.463 --> 12:40.009
<i>and a kind of, you know,</i>
<i>gravitas and power and all that stuff.</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:41.677
Time.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.137
Space.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.346
Reality.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.099
It's more than a linear path.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.186
It's a prism of endless possibilities.

12:50.269 --> 12:55.983
I like the idea of doing animation,
um, of using the voice really as,

12:56.066 --> 12:59.528
<i>you know, from my perspective,</i>
<i>as, you know, the whole character.</i>

12:59.612 --> 13:02.823
<i>I'd really just pretty much</i>
<i>do what I do with any script though,</i>

13:02.907 --> 13:06.118
<i>in anything, is just try</i>
<i>to find the music that's on the page</i>

13:06.202 --> 13:08.537
and figure out if I can play it, you know?

13:09.205 --> 13:10.206
I am the Watcher.

13:10.915 --> 13:14.668
I am your guide
through these vast new realities.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.838
Follow me and ponder the question...

13:18.714 --> 13:19.715
"What if?"

13:20.424 --> 13:25.721
<i>It was a really organic and kind of,</i>
<i>you know, methodical process</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:29.183
<i>of talking it through at first</i>
<i>and trying to give some ideas about,</i>

13:29.266 --> 13:33.103
<i>you know, how I'd like a,</i>
<i>you know, a character like this to sound.</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:37.900
I think often
when you have a character like this in,

13:37.983 --> 13:42.279
you know, in kind of the history of,
you know, shows and movies,

13:43.072 --> 13:44.824
we make these certain assumptions about

13:44.907 --> 13:47.243
what that character
should sound like, you know?

13:47.326 --> 13:50.120
Very often it's some, you know, old...

13:50.204 --> 13:53.624
You know, when we think
of power and wisdom and all of this,

13:53.707 --> 13:56.669
we think, well,
we go to the UK for some reason.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.128
We think of Brits.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.798
It's, like, well, you know, um...
(CLICKS TONGUE)

14:00.881 --> 14:03.884
I don't know
if the British necessarily have,

14:03.968 --> 14:06.136
like, the monopoly on all those things.

14:06.220 --> 14:10.140
<i>So, how can we find</i>
<i>some other tones and rhythms and things</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:15.521
<i>that bring all of that, um,</i>
<i>that power to the character</i>

14:15.604 --> 14:19.525
<i>but are grounded in maybe some different</i>
<i>rhythms and some different notes?</i>

14:19.608 --> 14:21.485
And that was a fun conversation to have.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.697
A genius battled
his demons both inside and out,

14:25.573 --> 14:28.826
while the world
met the monster hiding in the man.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.080
And a godly Prince fell to Earth.

14:33.163 --> 14:36.750
He's both the... the guardian,

14:36.834 --> 14:41.839
but also the observer
of what happens across the Multiverse.

14:41.922 --> 14:45.342
<i>There's a running joke in the comic books.</i>
<i>He says he'll never interfere.</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:48.470
<i>Wait five pages,</i>
<i>and there he is in the middle of it.</i>

14:51.223 --> 14:54.268
ANDREWS: <i>And in the comics,</i>
<i>he got downright goofy at times</i>

14:54.351 --> 14:55.895
<i>and involved all the time.</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:59.648
We're going to acknowledge those things,
but slowly over time.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.108
Maybe not the goofiness.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.818
<i>But we want to play with the conceit</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:05.821
<i>that the being is mysterious</i>
<i>for the first initial episodes,</i>

15:05.905 --> 15:10.367
<i>and we start seeing more and more</i>
<i>of him as the episodes play out.</i>

15:10.951 --> 15:14.371
<i>Uh, so by the end</i>
<i>he's actually full-figured.</i>

15:14.455 --> 15:17.666
We really see him. We really know like,
"Here's this alien being,"

15:17.750 --> 15:20.419
and he might actually
get involved for the...

15:20.502 --> 15:22.838
<i>For him, what might be the first time.</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:24.673
You want me to say it?

15:24.757 --> 15:27.426
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I wanna hear you say it.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.804
Okay.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.765
I can't believe I'm about to say this.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.142
I see now.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.103
I need your help.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.149
WINDERBAUM:
<i>The visual aesthetic and the storytelling</i>

15:42.232 --> 15:43.943
<i>really begin with Bryan Andrews.</i>

15:44.026 --> 15:47.363
<i>He is designing every frame of the show</i>

15:47.446 --> 15:50.115
<i>and working with a story team</i>
<i>of talented board artists</i>

15:50.199 --> 15:55.454
to create the cinematic flow
of this series.

15:55.537 --> 15:58.290
<i>And he's working</i>
<i>so closely with Ryan Meinerding</i>

15:58.374 --> 16:02.044
<i>to figure out</i>
<i>what these characters look like.</i>

16:02.127 --> 16:03.379
BRADLEY: <i>Ryan is amazing.</i>

16:03.462 --> 16:05.631
He's been the head
of Marvel Visual Development,

16:05.714 --> 16:07.591
I think since <i>Iron Man.</i>

16:07.675 --> 16:11.345
<i>He's brilliant, and we've been</i>
<i>so lucky that he's been wanting to,</i>

16:11.428 --> 16:13.681
<i>like, come and play in our sandbox.</i>

16:13.764 --> 16:17.643
MEINERDING: <i>I've always been a fan</i>
<i>of J.C. Leyendecker and Norman Rockwell</i>

16:17.726 --> 16:20.062
<i>and a lot of the older</i>
<i>American illustrators.</i>

16:20.145 --> 16:22.439
<i>And when Bryan and Brad pitched the notion</i>

16:22.523 --> 16:24.817
<i>of using that as a basis</i>
<i>for the style of the show.</i>

16:25.401 --> 16:27.319
I mean, that's my bread and butter.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.239
I love that stuff. So, trying
to find a way to create visuals

16:30.322 --> 16:33.575
for this project that are gonna
turn that illustrative style

16:33.659 --> 16:35.953
<i>into an animated style</i>
<i>using our characters</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:37.746
<i>is just, it's been really a lot of fun.</i>

16:38.747 --> 16:39.999
It's a good look on you.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.459
Really? You think I could pull it off?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.044
Maybe you'll grow into it.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.506
I was trained that there's no difference
between animation and live action,

16:47.589 --> 16:50.467
even though clearly
there are things that are different.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.263
<i>But, at its core,</i>
<i>it's just all visual storytelling.</i>

16:54.346 --> 16:56.849
<i>It's composition within the picture frame.</i>

16:56.932 --> 17:00.352
<i>It's... it's emotion. It's character.</i>

17:00.436 --> 17:04.398
<i>Uh, and those things exist regardless</i>
<i>of whether you're doing a stop-motion,</i>

17:04.481 --> 17:06.442
<i>a 2D animated thing,</i>
<i>3D animated, live ac...</i>

17:06.525 --> 17:07.776
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

17:07.860 --> 17:11.697
(SMACKS LIPS) <i>And I've felt personally</i>
<i>that animation hasn't quite gone</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:15.200
<i>as cinematic here</i>
<i>in the States as it could.</i>

17:15.284 --> 17:16.493
<i>And Brad was in agreement,</i>

17:16.577 --> 17:19.872
<i>and we felt like, here's a way</i>
<i>that maybe if we play our cards right,</i>

17:19.955 --> 17:22.166
<i>if whatever we do,</i>
<i>whatever is in our brain,</i>

17:22.249 --> 17:24.501
if we can get it out there onto the thing,

17:24.585 --> 17:26.003
maybe we could achieve that.

17:26.086 --> 17:29.131
Maybe we can, like,
move the bar a little bit,

17:29.214 --> 17:30.591
<i>which would be awesome.</i>

17:30.674 --> 17:33.969
<i>Just for our own</i>
<i>personal love of the stuff.</i>

17:34.053 --> 17:36.972
<i>And so part of that style</i>
<i>we're chasing is something that is,</i>

17:37.056 --> 17:39.433
<i>you know, atmospheric and cinematic</i>

17:39.516 --> 17:43.437
<i>and something</i>
<i>that borrows from live action,</i>

17:44.396 --> 17:48.484
<i>photography, cinematic sense</i>
<i>and really apply it to animation.</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:50.194
FURY: Looking for directions, sir?

17:50.277 --> 17:52.279
Because you seem to have lost your way.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.363
(CHUCKLES)

17:53.447 --> 17:56.617
You would do best to kneel before a God.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.869
We don't really do that here.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.498
The stories that they're doing
are so great and so concise

18:02.581 --> 18:07.127
that the direction that I'm getting is,
like, sort of like, this is the character.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.255
<i>This is the, you know,</i>
<i>the costume they would be in,</i>

18:10.339 --> 18:11.965
<i>we wanna twist it in this way.</i>

18:12.049 --> 18:15.260
<i>We're able to do some work that</i>
<i>hopefully is gonna land pretty quickly.</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:19.681
<i>It's also not only about character design</i>
<i>in sort of a live action sense of,</i>

18:19.765 --> 18:22.935
<i>like, "How is this character different</i>
<i>than what we've seen before?"</i>

18:23.018 --> 18:26.605
<i>But also, since we're trying</i>
<i>to develop a new animation style,</i>

18:26.688 --> 18:30.442
<i>sort of, like, how can we turn these</i>
<i>characters into animated characters</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:33.529
<i>in a way that still represents</i>
<i>the character from the film</i>

18:33.737 --> 18:37.574
<i>but gives them a new life</i>
<i>in sort of an animated form?</i>

18:38.867 --> 18:40.369
PEGGY: Steve Rogers sent me.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.329
The name's Captain Carter.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.249
WINDERBAUM:
<i>Another big decision for the show</i>

18:45.332 --> 18:49.753
<i>was that we were gonna chase character</i>
<i>likeness as opposed to actor likeness.</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:51.672
And it's a hard thing to define

18:51.755 --> 18:55.592
because the two things
are so intrinsically linked.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.596
But we wanted to capture the spirit
of the character in the same way

18:59.680 --> 19:02.808
<i>that the actor would capture the spirit</i>
<i>of the character on screen.</i>

19:02.891 --> 19:04.518
<i>And knowing that you're never gonna...</i>

19:04.601 --> 19:06.687
<i>It's not a photorealistic medium.</i>

19:06.770 --> 19:08.689
So the questions became, like,

19:08.772 --> 19:11.817
"Well, what is Doctor Strange?
What is Tony Stark?"

19:11.900 --> 19:16.864
How to depict them in terms of their
evolution as a character on screen?

19:16.947 --> 19:21.702
I'll say this for the new guy,
he certainly makes for good TV. Right?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.580
A lot of this stuff is fun
because you can do pencil sketches

19:24.663 --> 19:26.415
and have them be
relevant for the projects,

19:26.498 --> 19:32.462
so starting with Skinny Steve
and, um, a version of Captain Carter.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.881
Um...

19:33.964 --> 19:37.176
You know, just started trying
to find things that were interesting

19:37.259 --> 19:39.803
about the characters' faces
from the live action setting

19:39.887 --> 19:41.430
and try to simplify them.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.266
Um, you know, going forward from there

19:44.349 --> 19:48.478
into finding like a look for a dark Thor.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.480
Oh, do me, do me.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.649
(CHUCKLES) Yes, you do me.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.484
You do me and you too.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.612
Oh, you guys really get me.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.655
But yeah,
this is sort of the starting point,

19:58.739 --> 20:01.325
and I haven't sketched
all of them on paper.

20:01.408 --> 20:04.620
But I have done some of them.
And then transitioning into the computer,

20:04.703 --> 20:07.080
being able to color
and sort of refine them.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.373
(LAUGHS)

20:08.874 --> 20:11.126
(CHUCKLES) Oh, here we go. Here we go.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.211
Wha--

20:12.294 --> 20:14.254
ANDREWS: <i>We definitely want to stand out.</i>

20:14.338 --> 20:18.592
<i>And there is a variety of animated product</i>
<i>being made these days,</i>

20:18.675 --> 20:22.095
<i>and a lot of it tends to be CG</i>
<i>and sometimes even,</i>

20:22.888 --> 20:25.557
I guess they call it
two-and-a-half-D or 2D-3D,

20:25.641 --> 20:28.268
where it's like, it's 3D,
but it's made to look 2D.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.188
So you might have
your traditional backgrounds painted

20:31.271 --> 20:35.025
and the characters look as if
they're cel-painted on, but they're not.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.110
<i>We're exploring a variety of techniques</i>

20:37.194 --> 20:40.906
<i>and whatever is going to help us achieve</i>
<i>the look we're going for, we'll use.</i>

20:40.989 --> 20:45.661
<i>But we wanna kind of hide it a bit</i>
<i>and make sure that it doesn't jump out.</i>

20:45.744 --> 20:49.414
<i>And, in our opinion, it felt like a lot of</i>
<i>the things that we were seeing,</i>

20:49.498 --> 20:51.458
that stuff just jumps out, you know?

20:51.541 --> 20:53.543
And sometimes the 3D maybe isn't working.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.046
<i>There's aspects that were pros and cons,</i>

20:56.129 --> 20:59.383
<i>so it seemed like the best way</i>
<i>to achieve what we wanted to achieve,</i>

20:59.466 --> 21:03.136
<i>which is to buckle down,</i>
<i>have some really hard discipline,</i>

21:03.220 --> 21:05.097
<i>just make something rad 2D,</i>

21:05.180 --> 21:10.394
<i>so that we would have the artistic freedom</i>
<i>to have it look as rich as we wanted.</i>

21:10.477 --> 21:12.688
-(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
-(THE COLLECTOR LAUGHS)

21:12.771 --> 21:14.231
Packs quite a wallop, does it not?

21:17.859 --> 21:20.153
WINDERBAUM: <i>The earliest conversations</i>
<i>I had with Bryan Andrews</i>

21:20.237 --> 21:21.280
<i>were all about light.</i>

21:21.363 --> 21:24.658
<i>And quality of light</i>
<i>and how the light would kind of blow out</i>

21:24.741 --> 21:26.618
<i>and the atmosphere of the show itself.</i>

21:26.702 --> 21:31.123
Bryan was searching
for this cinematic style,

21:31.206 --> 21:34.209
using bokeh lenses and anamorphic lenses

21:34.293 --> 21:36.795
<i>or emulating them in an animated space</i>

21:36.878 --> 21:39.339
<i>to try to give the world of</i> What If...?

21:39.423 --> 21:44.219
<i>a real cinematic quality, um,</i>
<i>that we rarely see in animation.</i>

21:44.303 --> 21:47.264
ANDREWS: <i>Play with light and shadow,</i>
<i>play with... Play with focus.</i>

21:47.347 --> 21:49.850

32:57.350 --> 33:01.062
and Easter eggs
that allude to the original run.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.690
<i>The state in which they find</i>
<i>T'Challa being a big one,</i>

33:03.773 --> 33:06.359
<i>certain people's heads in jars.</i>

33:06.442 --> 33:08.444
SCOTT: Ta-da! See for yourself.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.238
-Wait, who said that?
-Was that ghost?

33:10.321 --> 33:12.365
SCOTT: Oh, damn.
Hey, would somebody turn me around?

33:12.448 --> 33:13.741
We messed up my entrance.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.327
You know, I need to get
this thing motorized. Hey!

33:16.411 --> 33:17.662
(GROWLS)

33:17.996 --> 33:19.372
(GRUNTS)

33:19.455 --> 33:21.874
<i>As we were developing</i>
<i>the Marvel Cinematic Universe</i>

33:21.958 --> 33:25.461
and all the projects that went
into creating this big tapestry,

33:25.545 --> 33:31.050
it was a very, you know,
specific house of cards, in a way.

33:31.134 --> 33:36.222
<i>In</i> What If...?, <i>we get to take</i>
<i>a baseball bat to that entire structure,</i>

33:36.305 --> 33:38.558
<i>and just shatter it into a million pieces</i>

33:38.641 --> 33:42.770
<i>and see what's left and rebuild in our own</i>

33:42.854 --> 33:46.399
<i>mutated, interesting, unexpected forms.</i>

33:53.781 --> 33:55.366
THE WATCHER: We've seen this before,

33:55.450 --> 33:58.661
a universe
in the final days of destruction.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.748
But this particular story...

34:02.498 --> 34:05.043
This, this one breaks my heart.

34:05.126 --> 34:08.004
I think in some ways,
everything is surprising about the series,

34:08.087 --> 34:11.257
that's what's wonderful about
this concept, this <i>What If...?</i> concept.

34:11.340 --> 34:15.636
<i>We have these known stories,</i>
<i>these known characters, these known arcs.</i>

34:15.720 --> 34:19.682
<i>Doesn't matter. Anything can be explored.</i>

34:19.766 --> 34:23.269
And so in some ways,
surprise is the whole point.

34:23.978 --> 34:26.314
WINDERBAUM:<i> In the story of season one,</i>

34:26.397 --> 34:30.985
<i>the Watcher makes it very clear to us</i>
<i>that he is not gonna get involved.</i>

34:31.069 --> 34:32.695
THE WATCHER: He's on the wrong path.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.198
I could warn him, intervene,

34:35.281 --> 34:39.285
but the fate of his universe is not worth
risking the safety of all others.

34:39.368 --> 34:42.622
But it just so happens
that there is a story

34:42.705 --> 34:46.751
that culminates our first season
that requires the Watcher's intervention.

34:47.585 --> 34:52.590
<i>We reimagine a world</i>
<i>where Ultron got the Vision's body</i>

34:52.673 --> 34:56.719
<i>as he meant to do</i>
<i>in</i> Age of Ultron, <i>the film.</i>

34:56.803 --> 34:59.931
<i>And when Thanos inevitably comes</i>

35:00.014 --> 35:04.143
<i>to get the Infinity Stone</i>
<i>from his forehead, he defeats Thanos.</i>

35:04.227 --> 35:06.062
Fascinating.

35:07.647 --> 35:10.358
WINDERBAUM:<i> And gets</i>
<i>all six Infinity Stones.</i>

35:10.441 --> 35:14.904
<i>Once he does that, he's able to wage war</i>
<i>against the entire cosmos</i>

35:14.987 --> 35:19.784
<i>and create an entire</i>
<i>universe devoid of all life.</i>

35:19.867 --> 35:24.205
<i>So devoid of life that he can actually</i>
<i>hear the voice of our narrator.</i>

35:24.288 --> 35:26.999
THE WATCHER: <i>Basking in</i>
<i>the boundless silence of his universe,</i>

35:27.083 --> 35:31.003
<i>Ultron ascended to a previously</i>
<i>unattainable level of consciousness.</i>

35:31.087 --> 35:33.214
<i>He became aware of another.</i>

35:34.590 --> 35:37.343
He became aware of the...

35:37.844 --> 35:39.679
I see you.

35:39.804 --> 35:40.972
(GASPS)

35:41.055 --> 35:43.266
WINDERBAUM:<i> And when</i>
<i>he's aware of the Watcher,</i>

35:43.349 --> 35:48.479
<i>he can break through the universal wall</i>
<i>and wage war on the Multiverse itself.</i>

35:48.563 --> 35:52.150
<i>Which forces the Watcher into a position</i>
<i>he's never been in before,</i>

35:52.233 --> 35:56.821
<i>which is to defend the very thing</i>
<i>that he's sworn an oath to only observe.</i>

35:56.904 --> 36:00.616
<i>And it just so happens,</i>
<i>the perfect cocktail of heroes</i>

36:00.700 --> 36:04.453
<i>that he needs to defeat</i>
<i>this Multiverse-destroying bad guy</i>

36:04.537 --> 36:08.875
<i>happen to be the same heroes whose stories</i>
<i>we've been watching all season long.</i>

36:08.958 --> 36:10.918
And they become
the Guardians of the Multiverse.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.754
-To the Guardians of...
-THOR: Yeah.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.923
-ALL: The Multiverse.
-...the Multiverse.

36:17.091 --> 36:20.720
The Multiverse. (ECHOES)

36:22.597 --> 36:26.350
I really believe that deepening
fictional mythologies

36:26.434 --> 36:30.271
<i>is a way to appreciate them more,</i>
<i>is a way to understand them more,</i>

36:30.354 --> 36:31.856
<i>look at them in a different way.</i>

36:31.939 --> 36:36.527
<i>And they've got now two seasons</i>
<i>of</i> What If...? <i>ideas underway</i>

36:36.611 --> 36:39.238
that's some of the best
storytelling we've ever had,

36:39.322 --> 36:42.408
and you may see spin into other mediums.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.411
<i>But it's really</i>
<i>the most uniquely beautiful</i>

36:45.494 --> 36:47.580
<i>animated series I've seen in a long time.</i>

36:52.251 --> 36:55.338
WINDERBAUM:
<i>We set out to make season one,</i>

36:56.339 --> 37:00.051
<i>believing that it might be</i>
<i>our first and last season.</i>

37:00.927 --> 37:06.515
So we wanted to tell a complete story
in those ten, now nine, episodes.

37:06.599 --> 37:09.018
<i>When we got greenlit</i>
<i>for the second season,</i>

37:10.019 --> 37:12.480
<i>we had to really look at the characters</i>

37:12.563 --> 37:16.108
<i>and really justify</i>
<i>why we would keep telling</i>

37:16.859 --> 37:18.819
<i>stories in this fashion.</i>

37:19.570 --> 37:23.199
<i>Obviously, you could spin out</i>
<i>any number of</i> What If...? <i>stories.</i>

37:23.282 --> 37:25.243
-(GROWLING)
<i>-And it's exciting to do so.</i>

37:25.326 --> 37:26.535
THE WASP: Bucky!

37:26.619 --> 37:29.413
But we were searching
for that central thread

37:29.497 --> 37:35.711
that could make it feel like
essential viewing for the MCU.

37:35.795 --> 37:41.550
<i>And what emerged was the relationship</i>
<i>between Captain Carter and the Watcher,</i>

37:42.468 --> 37:45.137
<i>which is something that evolves,</i>

37:45.221 --> 37:49.642
<i>uh, in a grand fashion</i>
<i>in the second season of the show.</i>

37:49.725 --> 37:52.019
You'd rather return to another time.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.647
Haven't I earned my happy ending?

37:55.856 --> 38:00.069
Trust me, that world, that time,

38:00.152 --> 38:01.988
needs Captain Carter.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.952
I love how richly invested
fans are in these stories

38:08.035 --> 38:11.205
and the characters and the films.

38:11.289 --> 38:14.292
<i>One of the things about Marvel fans,</i>

38:14.375 --> 38:19.714
<i>I think, is that they have</i>
<i>Marvel universes in their heads as well.</i>

38:19.797 --> 38:22.550
<i>They have what exists on film,</i>
<i>what exists in the comics,</i>

38:22.633 --> 38:24.552
<i>but then in their heads,</i>
<i>they have these other,</i>

38:24.635 --> 38:28.556
<i>you know, imaginings</i>
<i>and stories that they tell too.</i>

38:28.639 --> 38:32.560
<i>And I think that's all a part</i>
<i>of the storytelling universe.</i>

38:32.643 --> 38:37.023
<i>And so the opportunity</i>
<i>for us to begin to explore</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:40.526
<i>these alternate realities in ways</i>
<i>that might touch on some ideas</i>

38:40.609 --> 38:42.653
<i>that fans have had, or don't,</i>

38:42.737 --> 38:48.534
<i>or surpass those expectations,</i>
<i>is gonna be really cool.</i>

38:48.617 --> 38:50.953
<i>And it also opens the door</i>

38:51.787 --> 38:56.500
<i>and a series of doors</i>
<i>to other endless possibilities.</i>

39:00.629 --> 39:06.093
THE WATCHER: <i>You, your stories,</i>
<i>they are everything to me.</i>

39:11.557 --> 39:13.559
