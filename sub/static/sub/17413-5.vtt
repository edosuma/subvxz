00:16.413 --> 00:18.546
Guess what I have?

00:18.547 --> 00:19.547
Mistletoe?

00:19.548 --> 00:21.998
Don't make us kiss.
It's embarrassing.

00:21.999 --> 00:24.352
Mistletoe? I meant I
have sweaty armpits.

00:24.353 --> 00:26.421
I'm working way too hard.

00:26.422 --> 00:28.762
Break time.

00:30.424 --> 00:33.458
Trish! How'd your meeting
at the toy company go?

00:33.459 --> 00:38.089
Amazing. I have the prototype for this
holiday season's hottest new toy.

00:38.090 --> 00:41.150
The Austin Moon doll.

00:43.465 --> 00:45.131
This is cool.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.512
And check this out.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.096
<i>♪ I'm gonna make...</i>

00:48.097 --> 00:51.369
<i>♪ Make, make you
do a double take.</i>

00:51.370 --> 00:52.559
Bam!

00:52.560 --> 00:54.404
Awesome.

00:54.405 --> 00:57.857
Will they be ready by Christmas? I want
to give them out at the kids club party.

00:57.858 --> 01:01.916
Yeah, these dolls are at the
top of every kid's wish list.

01:01.917 --> 01:04.000
Little Matthew wants
an Austin doll.

01:04.001 --> 01:06.068
Little Hanna wants
an Austin doll.

01:06.069 --> 01:07.439
Little Dez wants a...

01:07.440 --> 01:09.107
Little Dez?

01:09.108 --> 01:11.052
I don't know how
that got in there.

01:11.053 --> 01:14.142
It's supposed to go
directly to Santa.

01:14.143 --> 01:15.177
Don't worry, Austin.

01:15.178 --> 01:18.846
The toy company said they'll have a big
shipment ready just in time for Christmas.

01:18.847 --> 01:22.216
Great. For a lot of these kids it's the
only gift they're gonna get this year.

01:22.217 --> 01:23.950
Yeah. And since I'm
hosting the party,

01:23.951 --> 01:26.665
I want to make this their
best Christmas ever.

01:26.666 --> 01:30.656
We're gonna write a new Christmas song for
the kids and perform it as a surprise.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.124
Great idea.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.388
And there's gonna be
press at the party too.

01:34.389 --> 01:37.311
So it'll be a great opportunity to
make yourself look good, Austin.

01:37.312 --> 01:39.029
I don't care about that.

01:39.030 --> 01:43.196
I just feel so lucky, I want to give
back to people who aren't as lucky.

01:43.197 --> 01:47.903
Perfect. That's exactly the kind of
junk you have to say to the press.

01:47.904 --> 01:51.873
I don't know how I'm gonna have enough time
to write a new song and plan this party.

01:51.874 --> 01:54.875
Well, since the party's at the
beach club, let me plan it.

01:54.876 --> 01:58.144
I'll make sure this is the best
Christmas those kids have ever had.

01:58.145 --> 02:01.168
Wow, I've never seen you so
excited about work before, Trish.

02:01.169 --> 02:03.849
Hey, it's for the most
worthy cause there is.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.604
Making a child's Christmas
wish come true.

02:06.605 --> 02:09.535
Nope. Making me look good so
I can get a big promotion.

02:09.536 --> 02:12.484
But that child's wish thing too.

02:12.485 --> 02:16.025
That's the Christmas spirit.

02:19.531 --> 02:22.633
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:22.634 --> 02:25.768

<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:36.638 --> 02:38.960
<i>♪ And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:38.961 --> 02:43.098
<i>♪ Oh, there's no way I

02:43.099 --> 02:46.134
<i>♪ Do it without ya,

02:46.135 --> 02:49.204
<i>♪ It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

02:49.205 --> 02:52.527

02:52.528 --> 02:55.177

03:01.674 --> 03:06.114
<i>♪ Do it without ya,

03:16.878 --> 03:19.158
Oh, Trish!

03:19.213 --> 03:24.150
I'm so excited we're having the kids
club Christmas party at Shredders.

03:24.151 --> 03:26.157
I can't thank you enough.

03:26.158 --> 03:30.089
How about just thanking me with that party
planner promotion and we'll call it even.

03:30.090 --> 03:31.692
Silly goose.

03:31.693 --> 03:35.585
I can't promote you until you
pull off a disaster-free party.

03:35.586 --> 03:38.966
We don't need another flying
pig incident like at the luau.

03:38.967 --> 03:42.087
That was pretty funny.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.712
I mean, that won't
ever happen again.

03:44.713 --> 03:45.804
Ah.

03:45.805 --> 03:48.567
Don't you just love Christmas?

03:48.568 --> 03:51.688
<i>♪ Deck the halls,

03:51.689 --> 03:52.947

<i>♪ And a partridge
in a pear tree...</i>

03:56.318 --> 03:58.153
Yeah, that's not a song.

03:58.154 --> 04:01.223
<i>♪ Joy to the silent night.</i>

04:01.224 --> 04:04.224
<i>♪ O, Christmas Tree!</i>

04:05.732 --> 04:08.585
I'm here for the Santa job.
When do we start?

04:08.586 --> 04:12.168
I can't just give you the job. You
have to audition like everybody else.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.516
I'm only hiring the best Santa.

04:14.517 --> 04:18.975
Oh, I'm the best Santa because I
have this inflatable Santa suit.

04:18.976 --> 04:21.076
Observe.

04:23.246 --> 04:28.706
The "I ate way too many
cookies and milk" Saint Nick.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.890
The "jolly belly like a bowl full of
jelly" chubster we know as Santa Claus.

04:34.891 --> 04:36.475
Ho ho ho.

04:36.476 --> 04:38.127
Impressive.

04:38.128 --> 04:41.535
But you still have to audition
with those other Santas.

04:41.536 --> 04:47.436
I'm surprised so many of them came out
for a job that doesn't pay anything.

04:48.305 --> 04:51.941
It's for charity.
What did you expect?

04:51.942 --> 04:53.943
I don't care about the money.

04:53.944 --> 04:57.656
I'm just here to bring joy to kids
and wear a really cool fat suit.

04:57.657 --> 05:00.665
But mostly the fat suit.

05:00.666 --> 05:04.120
Well, since you're the only guy
left, I guess you can be Santa.

05:04.121 --> 05:05.981
Yes!

05:06.712 --> 05:09.325
Not so fast, Red.

05:09.326 --> 05:12.027
Chuck. What are you doing here?

05:12.028 --> 05:13.435
What does it look like?

05:13.436 --> 05:19.231
I'm here to bring good tidings and
cheer to the children of Miami.

05:19.232 --> 05:21.389
No one's as jolly as me.

05:21.390 --> 05:27.290
I'm so jolly, when I was born, the Doctor
slapped me and I laughed in his face.

05:28.067 --> 05:33.409
Well, I'm so jolly, people in England
don't say "have a jolly good time".

05:33.410 --> 05:37.430
They say "have a
Chuck good time".

05:38.088 --> 05:41.391
Guys. There's only one
way to settle this.

05:41.392 --> 05:45.352
We're gonna have
a Santa contest.

05:45.353 --> 05:46.462
<i>♪ Ho ho ho...</i>

05:46.463 --> 05:49.043
<i>♪ Ho ho ho...</i>

05:49.288 --> 05:52.108
That was terrible.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.105
Ho ho ho.

05:54.106 --> 05:56.864
Ho ho ho ho ho.

05:56.865 --> 05:59.274
That was good.

05:59.275 --> 06:03.639
Okay. I want to see who does the best
job hanging up Christmas lights.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.238
What does that have to
do with being Santa?

06:06.239 --> 06:09.250
It doesn't have anything to do
with me getting a promotion.

06:09.251 --> 06:11.886
Why would you say that?

06:11.887 --> 06:13.888
Oh, I love hanging lights.

06:13.889 --> 06:17.429
This shouldn't be too hard.

06:30.039 --> 06:33.399
I think I made it worse.

06:39.815 --> 06:43.111
You have to carry these sacks
of toys across the beach

06:43.112 --> 06:45.253
and put them in that dumpster.

06:45.254 --> 06:46.245
Okay.

06:46.246 --> 06:48.399
On your mark, get set...

06:48.400 --> 06:50.200
Go!

06:55.833 --> 06:56.999
Hey, look!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.860
Huh?

07:18.789 --> 07:20.649
Yes.

07:20.791 --> 07:22.992
Ooh. Another tie.

07:22.993 --> 07:25.895
- Are you kidding?
- No way!

07:25.896 --> 07:28.130
Why did we throw
away those toys?

07:28.131 --> 07:30.933
Those weren't toys.
That was trash.

07:30.934 --> 07:35.974
You guys just saved me
like four hours of work.

07:40.943 --> 07:45.503
Well, that's the last
of the decorations.

07:46.081 --> 07:48.039
Hey, look.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.438
We're under the mistletoe again.

07:51.439 --> 07:54.259
What do you know?

07:57.993 --> 08:01.229
- They're here!
- Austin dolls, coming through.

08:01.230 --> 08:06.090
- They're here.
- Just in time for the party.

08:10.816 --> 08:13.331
This isn't right.

08:13.332 --> 08:17.892
They all have long,
flowing Princess hair.

08:18.499 --> 08:22.216
Long, flowing, gorgeous
Princess hair.

08:22.217 --> 08:25.853
The toy company also makes
Princess Priscilla dolls.

08:25.854 --> 08:27.989
There must have been a
mix-up at the factory.

08:27.990 --> 08:30.468
I can't give these freak
show dolls to the kids.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.265
It'll ruin their Christmas.

08:32.267 --> 08:34.333
I have to write
Santa a new letter.

08:34.335 --> 08:40.215
I am not replacing my Teddy
Bear with one of these mutants.

08:45.951 --> 08:47.610
What did the toy company say?

08:47.611 --> 08:50.613
They're gonna fix the dolls
and send out a new shipment.

08:50.614 --> 08:55.352
But because it's Christmas Eve, it's not
gonna get here till after the holidays.

08:55.353 --> 08:57.713
- What are we gonna do?
- Relax, buddy.

08:57.714 --> 09:00.442
You don't want to give out these
dolls because they have long hair.

09:00.443 --> 09:04.703
I think the solution's
pretty obvious.

09:07.641 --> 09:10.922
We'll give them these instead.

09:10.923 --> 09:14.193
I can't give them an arts and
crafts project for Christmas.

09:14.194 --> 09:17.651
The kids will think it's lame.

09:17.652 --> 09:19.620
I know how to fix this, Austin.

09:19.621 --> 09:24.301
All we have to do is
cut the dolls' hair.

09:24.309 --> 09:27.489
Looks pretty good, huh?

09:27.595 --> 09:30.775
I think mine's better.

09:31.014 --> 09:32.367
Let's see yours, Ally.

09:32.368 --> 09:35.202
I couldn't bear cutting
my doll's hair.

09:35.203 --> 09:37.570
It's just so gorgeous.

09:37.571 --> 09:39.371
Ah.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.074
This is how we have to cut all the
dolls' hair, and we need to do it fast.

09:44.075 --> 09:47.971
- The Christmas party's tomorrow.
- I know exactly what to do.

09:47.972 --> 09:53.732
Trish, you're going to see why
I'll make the best Santa.

10:08.669 --> 10:11.968
This Santa workshop was
a great idea, Dez.

10:11.969 --> 10:13.201
I'm almost out of gel.

10:13.202 --> 10:17.380
Oh, don't worry. Hey, look. One of
Santa's helpers is here with more.

10:17.381 --> 10:20.483
For the last time, kid. I
don't work at the North Pole.

10:20.484 --> 10:22.679
I'm just a delivery guy.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.617
Hey. You're not just
a delivery guy.

10:25.618 --> 10:28.527
You're a guy who
delivers dreams.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.048
Whatever, kid.

10:32.354 --> 10:34.213
Woo. We did it.

10:34.214 --> 10:37.424
Those needy kids are gonna
get their Christmas wish.

10:37.425 --> 10:41.474
And that's more important to
me than getting my promotion.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.806
Oh, who am I kidding? I'm just
doing this for the money.

10:45.807 --> 10:48.363
Hey, guys. I just
realized something.

10:48.364 --> 10:53.316
That it's way too long past Labor
Day to be wearing that white top?

10:53.317 --> 10:55.099
No.

10:55.100 --> 10:57.016
It's Christmas morning.

10:57.017 --> 11:00.075
Oh yeah. Merry Christmas, guys.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.716
Merry Christmas.

11:05.692 --> 11:10.029
Okay, enough of this sentimental garbage.
We've got presents to wrap.

11:10.030 --> 11:12.323
It's too bad Santa
isn't here to help us.

11:12.324 --> 11:14.296
Oh, but he is.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.602
Say hello to Santa.

11:16.603 --> 11:18.341
Ho ho ho ho ho ho.

11:18.342 --> 11:20.114
Ho ho ho ho...

11:20.115 --> 11:22.935
Not so fast, Red.

11:23.335 --> 11:27.487
How does he always show up the exact
time Dez is about to win something?

11:27.488 --> 11:29.715
It's one of my many talents.

11:29.716 --> 11:33.838
I can also burp the alphabet,
tie my shoes with one hand...

11:33.839 --> 11:38.977
And I do a pretty mean impression of my
third grade English teacher Mr. Nagel.

11:38.978 --> 11:41.918
Hi, I'm Mr. Nagel.

11:43.729 --> 11:46.302
Uh, how do we know if
that's a good impression?

11:46.303 --> 11:48.069
We don't know that guy.

11:48.070 --> 11:51.370
Trust me, it's spot on.

11:51.636 --> 11:55.842
Before I decide who's gonna be
Santa, I have one more contest.

11:55.843 --> 11:58.192
Which one of you can wrap
presents the fastest?

11:58.193 --> 12:00.962
Oh, that would be me.

12:00.963 --> 12:05.005
I'm so fast, the next time
Chuck says "Not so fast, Red".

12:05.006 --> 12:09.016
He's gonna say
"not so Dez, Red".

12:09.017 --> 12:13.079
Well, I'm so fast, pitchers
don't throw fastballs...

12:13.080 --> 12:16.010
They throw Chuck balls.

12:16.011 --> 12:19.246
I'm so fast there's now three
measurements of speed.

12:19.247 --> 12:25.147
The speed of sound, the speed
of light, and the speed of Dez.

12:25.294 --> 12:28.222
- I'm so fast...
- Quit yapping and start wrapping.

12:28.223 --> 12:30.623
Yes, Ma'am.

12:40.709 --> 12:43.229
Pfft! Amateur.

12:55.117 --> 12:57.637
Oh, it's on.

13:03.359 --> 13:05.279
Whoa!

13:10.036 --> 13:11.232
Finished!

13:11.233 --> 13:13.033
- I won.
- No, I won.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.532
Nobody's won yet.

13:14.533 --> 13:18.513
Let's see which Santa can carry the
most gifts down to the beach club.

13:18.514 --> 13:20.688
We're not falling for that.

13:20.689 --> 13:23.736
You just want us to do your work
so you can get a promotion.

13:23.737 --> 13:24.912
Yeah.

13:24.913 --> 13:29.713
- Hey, Red. Your shoe's untied.
- Oh, thanks.

13:29.986 --> 13:31.744
I'm gonna win!

13:31.745 --> 13:34.445
No, you're not.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.167
We'd better get down
to the beach club.

13:46.168 --> 13:48.602
I want to personally hand out
all the gifts to the kids.

13:48.603 --> 13:51.688
I'll meet you down there.

13:51.689 --> 13:54.814
- What are you doing?
- Uh...

13:54.815 --> 13:57.554
Not buying you a last
minute Christmas present.

13:57.555 --> 14:00.315
That's for sure.

14:03.466 --> 14:06.219
Hey, look. We forgot
a couple of dolls.

14:06.220 --> 14:10.123
I still can't figure out why
they came with baby bottles.

14:10.124 --> 14:12.884
Mommy, change me.

14:15.269 --> 14:17.995
The Austin doll just peed on me.

14:17.996 --> 14:19.761
Why did it do that?

14:19.762 --> 14:24.170
Oh no. The toy company also
makes "Mommy, Change Me" dolls.

14:24.171 --> 14:27.375
- They must have mixed that up, too!
- That explains the bottle.

14:27.376 --> 14:30.276
We have to get to the party before
Austin gives these to the kids.

14:30.277 --> 14:33.036
Maybe they're not all messed up.

14:33.037 --> 14:35.797
Mommy, change me.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.685
Okay. They're all messed up.

14:48.328 --> 14:50.771
Here you go, sweetie. I
hope it's what you wanted.

14:50.772 --> 14:52.742
I got it straight
from Santa Claus.

14:52.743 --> 14:55.083
That's me.

14:55.944 --> 14:59.638
An Austin Moon doll? Thank
you so much, Austin.

14:59.639 --> 15:03.173
This is the best Christmas ever.

15:03.174 --> 15:04.855
Aw.

15:04.856 --> 15:06.994
That's why I love Christmas.

15:06.995 --> 15:12.823
I have to say I doubted Trish, but she
actually pulled off a disaster-free party.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.183
Yeah, she did.

15:14.184 --> 15:15.699
Hey, kids!

15:15.700 --> 15:19.127
Those dolls don't just look cool. For
a real surprise, press the button.

15:19.128 --> 15:23.028
- Mommy, change me.
- Austin, no!

15:29.061 --> 15:32.626
That's not what they're
supposed to do.

15:32.627 --> 15:36.007
This isn't a real Austin doll.

15:36.008 --> 15:39.008
You ruined Christmas.

15:45.738 --> 15:47.806
I can't believe I
ruined Christmas.

15:47.807 --> 15:51.545
It's not your fault, Austin.
You didn't know.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.600
Trish, do something.

15:53.601 --> 15:56.512
The party's a disaster.

15:56.513 --> 15:59.753
Look, kids. It's Santa.

16:00.629 --> 16:02.909
Ho ho ho.

16:03.243 --> 16:05.728
He's not the real Santa.

16:05.729 --> 16:08.522
Well how about this one?

16:08.523 --> 16:10.803
Ho ho ho.

16:10.849 --> 16:12.936
He isn't either.

16:12.937 --> 16:14.829
I'm Santa, little girl.

16:14.830 --> 16:17.854
How else would I know that you
wanted an Austin doll for Christmas?

16:17.855 --> 16:20.689
Every kid in Miami wanted one.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.758
She's good.

16:22.759 --> 16:24.861
Neither one of you is Santa.

16:24.862 --> 16:27.202
I'm Santa.

16:30.219 --> 16:32.859
No, I'm Santa.

16:37.423 --> 16:40.063
No, I'm Santa.

16:42.112 --> 16:44.752
No, I'm Santa.

16:46.249 --> 16:48.756
No, I'm Santa.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.120
No, I'm Santa!

16:51.121 --> 16:53.299
- No, I'm Santa!
- I'm Santa.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.507
- No, I'm Santa.
- I'm Santa.

16:55.508 --> 16:58.148
No, I'm Santa.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.906
First I ruin Christmas, now
they're ruining the party.

17:11.907 --> 17:17.094
On the bright side, no one's paying
attention to the dolls anymore.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.914
So...

17:18.915 --> 17:20.403
About that promotion?

17:20.404 --> 17:23.404
I give promotions
to party planners.

17:23.405 --> 17:25.347
Not party wreckers!

17:25.348 --> 17:28.888
Wait wait. I can save this.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.738
Kids, go eat Christmas cookies.

17:33.739 --> 17:38.132
Austin and Ally, get ready. Dez
and Chuck, clean this place up.

17:38.133 --> 17:41.479
- Why do we have to clean this place up?
- Do you want to see new year's?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.880
Yes, Ma'am.

17:44.436 --> 17:50.336
And now to make your Christmas wishes come
true, give it up for Austin and Ally.

I take it back, Austin. You
didn't ruin Christmas.

19:46.913 --> 19:50.509
This is the best Christmas ever.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.910
For me too.

19:53.281 --> 19:55.974
I told you Christmas
wasn't about presents.

19:55.975 --> 19:58.555
I'm glad you think so. Because
I didn't get you anything.

19:58.556 --> 20:00.476
What?

20:00.815 --> 20:03.275
I'm kidding.

20:04.626 --> 20:07.866
So... I decided you're
getting that promotion.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.868
Congratulations, Trish.

20:09.869 --> 20:12.117
You're Shredders'
new party planner.

20:12.118 --> 20:15.712
Really? Thank you. So
when do I get my raise?

20:15.713 --> 20:18.643
Oh, this promotion doesn't
come with more money.

20:18.644 --> 20:21.555
Just a bigger title
and longer hours.

20:21.556 --> 20:23.882
Merry Christmas, party planner.

20:23.883 --> 20:27.663
See you tomorrow at 6:00 A.M.

20:28.547 --> 20:30.631
Let that be a
lesson to you, kid.

20:30.632 --> 20:34.172
Hard work is waste of time.

20:35.892 --> 20:37.830
You make a pretty
good Santa, Dez.

20:37.831 --> 20:39.500
Thanks, Chuck. You too.

20:39.501 --> 20:41.921
We'll call this one a tie
as long as you admit

20:41.922 --> 20:44.016
that I'm better than you
at everything else.

20:44.017 --> 20:46.089
Deal. Wait, what?

20:46.090 --> 20:51.550
- Merry Christmas, Red.
- I got something for you, too.

20:57.084 --> 20:58.598
I love it.

20:58.599 --> 20:59.953
I love it too.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.089
I don't know why we're
always so competitive.

21:02.090 --> 21:03.824
We should stop doing that.

21:03.825 --> 21:07.004
But you have to admit
I'm nicer than you.

21:07.005 --> 21:08.739
Actually, I'm a lot
nicer than you.

21:08.740 --> 21:13.900
- No, I'm nicer than you.
- I'm definitely nicer.

21:16.871 --> 21:19.202
Thanks, Austin. I love it.

21:19.203 --> 21:22.263
Merry Christmas, Ally.

21:24.812 --> 21:27.080
Hey, look. We're under
the mistletoe again.

21:27.081 --> 21:30.201
Well, rules are rules.

21:33.821 --> 21:37.601
- I'm nicer.
- No, I'm nicer.

21:39.922 --> 21:42.142
Look out!

21:44.032 --> 21:45.561
You're right, Red.

21:45.562 --> 21:48.142
You are nicer.

21:48.773 --> 21:52.253
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!

21:58.711 --> 22:01.629
I've got a delivery
here for Austin Moon.

22:01.630 --> 22:03.970
That's me.

22:12.235 --> 22:16.075
Hey, it's the Austin Moon doll.

22:16.338 --> 22:17.954
<i>♪ I'm gonna make...</i>

22:17.955 --> 22:21.160
<i>♪ Make, make you
do a double take.</i>

22:21.161 --> 22:23.021
Bam!

22:23.350 --> 22:26.115
- They're all fixed.
- But, that's weird.

22:26.116 --> 22:30.522
The toy company said they wouldn't
be ready till after Christmas.

22:30.523 --> 22:35.009
Hey, that guy looks a
lot like Santa Claus.

22:35.010 --> 22:36.495
You don't think...

22:36.496 --> 22:38.998
That Larry really works for Santa?
I knew it!

22:38.999 --> 22:44.475
For the last time kid I don't work at the
North Pole, I'm just a delivery guy.

22:44.476 --> 22:46.276
Aw!

22:46.507 --> 22:50.490
Let's get the sleigh and got out of
here Santa, we almost blew our cover.
