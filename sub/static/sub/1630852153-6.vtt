holding the ceiling, and the
walls are kind of freestanding,

27:59.767 --> 28:00.834
How much do these
things weigh though?

28:00.967 --> 28:05.467
170 pounds, each.
They're heavy.

28:05.600 --> 28:09.834
I'm thinking for these,
1500 apiece.

28:09.967 --> 28:11.300
1500 apiece?

28:11.433 --> 28:14.400
Which is very reasonable
since they're 600 in scrap.

28:14.533 --> 28:18.633
Okay. You still gotta buy at
least 2 for the right property,

28:18.767 --> 28:21.233
so that's 3000.
Then I have to

28:21.367 --> 28:24.200
sell it to my client for
a certain amount as well, too,

28:24.333 --> 28:26.300
so you gotta
be smart with the price.

28:26.433 --> 28:29.467
I'm flexible. What do you think
these would retail for?

28:29.600 --> 28:30.767
I'm gonna throw
that one back at you?

28:30.900 --> 28:32.633
That's not fair,
that's not fair!

28:32.767 --> 28:35.967
Um... I know what I would
want to pay for them,

28:36.100 --> 28:40.667
but I know that they could
probably sell for 15, 20,000.

28:40.800 --> 28:43.800
- Seriously? Really, yeah?
- To the right client.

28:43.934 --> 28:45.266

150 grand out of there,

of work to clean these up.

29:37.166 --> 29:40.066

Ted said 250,000.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.266
Now it's like 150,000, so

29:42.400 --> 29:44.233
I don't know where
the 100,000 went.

29:44.367 --> 29:46.967

such a way that we could

29:48.967 --> 29:50.967

- Yeah.

29:58.166 --> 29:59.266
How'd you take 'em apart?

29:59.400 --> 30:01.200
Punched 'em out and hit it
with a big pry bar and

30:01.333 --> 30:04.333

that was taking a long time.

value of the wood,

be not broken,

have no steel in it.
