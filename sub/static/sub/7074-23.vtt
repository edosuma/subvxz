WEBVTT

00:11.701 --> 00:13.302
He's the one trying
to bring back disco.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.671
I don't have to be old
to know it's not gonna happen.

00:17.908 --> 00:20.976
What it is, soul brother.

00:21.044 --> 00:22.259
My boys are gonna make me
breakfast in bed

00:22.327 --> 00:23.824
For mother's day.

00:23.892 --> 00:25.462
Well, actually, I'm gonna make
the breakfast and get in bed,

00:25.530 --> 00:26.493
But they're gonna
bring it to me.

00:26.561 --> 00:28.329
- Aw.
- Oh, I know!

00:28.397 --> 00:29.930
And then they said
the cutest thing last night.

00:29.998 --> 00:32.296
They said, "mama,"
'cause they call me mama--

00:32.365 --> 00:33.700
- Well, if you're gonna be
the fun police--

00:33.768 --> 00:35.105
- Okay, well,
if I'm the fun police,

00:35.176 --> 00:36.344
Then you're director
of Funland security.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.746
Ugh!

00:37.814 --> 00:40.324
- Oh, good, more of this.
- More of what?

00:40.391 --> 00:42.092
What do you think?
The constant bickering.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.169
It was cute at first, but...
Well, Abed explains it best.

00:45.239 --> 00:47.240
To be blunt, Jeff and Britta
is no Ross and Rachel.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.742
Your sexual tension
and lack of chemistry

00:48.809 --> 00:50.677
Are putting us all on edge,
which is why, ironically--

00:50.745 --> 00:52.078
And hear this on every level--

00:52.146 --> 00:53.414
You're keeping us
from being friends.

00:53.482 --> 00:55.882
Jeff and I do not have
sexual tension.

00:55.950 --> 00:57.885
We just argue all the time.

00:57.953 --> 01:00.554
Oh, just like Sam and Diane.
I hated Sam and Diane.

01:00.622 --> 01:02.156
Who are Sam and Diane?

01:02.224 --> 01:03.924
Okay, we get it.
You're young! Sorry.

01:03.992 --> 01:05.358
You see what
you're doing to us?

01:05.427 --> 01:06.560
Want my advice?

01:06.628 --> 01:08.762
Pork her and move on.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.097
We did it all the time
in my day.

01:10.164 --> 01:11.831
Yeah, well, you also put
hydrogen in blimps,

01:11.899 --> 01:13.499
And that was bad.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.969
Hey, everybody.
Just a reminder.

01:16.036 --> 01:18.574
Our spring fling
is on the quad today.

01:18.642 --> 01:21.110
Music, food, activities.
What, what?

01:21.178 --> 01:22.812
Ha. He makes me
uncomfortable.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.814
Mm. Still in the room.

01:24.882 --> 01:28.454
There's also going to be
a game of paintball assassin

01:28.522 --> 01:30.423
With a prize
for last man standing.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.459
Or last man in a wheelchair
with no paint on him.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.097
- Or last woman.
- Give it a rest, Britta.

01:35.164 --> 01:36.499
Ugh!
What's the prize?

01:36.566 --> 01:39.636
<i>- It was a blu-ray DVD player,
but it was stolen.</i>

01:39.704 --> 01:41.740
So now it's tbd.

01:41.807 --> 01:43.676
I want tbd.
Is that new?

01:43.744 --> 01:44.911
If it's what I think,

01:44.978 --> 01:46.346
I had it for about a month
in the '70s.

01:46.414 --> 01:47.615
Let's get back
to Britta and Jeff.

01:47.682 --> 01:49.851
There's no Britta and Jeff.

01:49.918 --> 01:51.320
He said, fully erect.

01:51.388 --> 01:53.089
Well, I'm gonna let you guys
figure this out

01:53.157 --> 01:55.859
While I go take a nap
in my car.

02:00.199 --> 02:01.466
What are you waiting for?

02:02.535 --> 02:03.635
Unh!

02:05.105 --> 02:07.941
* give me some more
time in a dream *

02:08.008 --> 02:11.512
* give me the hope
to run out of steam *

02:11.580 --> 02:14.516
* somebody said
it could be here *

02:14.584 --> 02:16.151
* we could be roped up *

02:16.219 --> 02:18.621
* tied up, dead in a year *

02:18.689 --> 02:23.893
* I can't count
the reasons I should stay *

02:23.961 --> 02:28.030
* one by one,
they all just fade away *

03:00.168 --> 03:03.037
Hello?

03:09.444 --> 03:11.545
What is going on?

03:11.613 --> 03:14.214
- The paintball game was--
was starting,

03:14.282 --> 03:16.116
And the--and the dean...

03:16.184 --> 03:18.086
The dean announced

03:18.153 --> 03:19.221
Th-the prize.

03:19.289 --> 03:21.423
The prize!

03:21.491 --> 03:24.627
We--we turned on each other
like...Like animals!

03:24.695 --> 03:26.696
- What was the prize?
- Was?

03:26.764 --> 03:28.966
This is not over!

03:29.034 --> 03:31.402
This is still happening...
Right now!

03:31.470 --> 03:32.904
Aah!

03:32.971 --> 03:33.972
Leonard?

03:34.039 --> 03:36.808
Leonard, I'm not playing!

03:36.876 --> 03:38.610
Everyone's playing!

03:50.022 --> 03:51.122
Aw...

03:51.190 --> 03:53.157
You suck!

03:57.997 --> 04:01.400
Come with me if you don't
want paint on your clothes.

04:08.808 --> 04:11.877
Hey. Look what I found
wandering the neutral zone.

04:13.379 --> 04:15.013
Jeff winger.

04:15.081 --> 04:17.682
You son of a bitch!

04:17.750 --> 04:21.087
I thought you were dead, man!

04:21.154 --> 04:24.658
I was just taking a nap.
Has everyone lost their mind?

04:24.725 --> 04:26.493
It's just a game of paintball.

04:26.561 --> 04:28.929
Last man
standing gets the prize.

04:28.997 --> 04:30.598
The prize.

04:30.665 --> 04:32.033
The prize.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.902
What is this prize?

04:36.572 --> 04:39.206
You don't know.

04:39.274 --> 04:40.541
Priority registration.

04:40.609 --> 04:42.443
Priority registration.

04:42.511 --> 04:47.281
That's why everyone's
running around like a bunch--

04:47.349 --> 04:48.983
Does that mean
what I think it means?

04:49.050 --> 04:50.785
Like you could have
first choice

04:50.852 --> 04:52.887
Of your classes next semester?

04:55.223 --> 04:56.457
Easy, sugar bear.

04:56.525 --> 04:58.325
Yeah, but you could schedule

04:58.393 --> 05:00.862
All your classes on a Monday
and then take a six-day weekend.

05:00.929 --> 05:02.664
You could do a lot of things.

05:02.732 --> 05:04.967
Talk him through
the hunger, Abed.

05:05.034 --> 05:06.535
Every student
wants that prize, Jeff.

05:06.603 --> 05:07.736
And there's no way to share it,

05:07.804 --> 05:09.371
So we'll eventually
all turn on each other.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.073
But the longer we wait
to do that--Jeff!

05:11.141 --> 05:14.076
The longer we work together,
the longer we last.

05:14.144 --> 05:15.477
Is everyone running in packs?

05:15.545 --> 05:16.578
The debate team
was the first to do it,

05:16.646 --> 05:17.779
But they fell to infighting.

05:17.847 --> 05:19.482
They say the glee club
is luring stragglers

05:19.549 --> 05:22.217
Into sniper traps with cheery
renditions of hit songs.

05:22.285 --> 05:24.386
Really?
And people fall for that?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.221
- Yeah.
- I mean, I'm all for winning,

05:26.289 --> 05:28.456
But let's not resort
to cheap ploys.

05:31.493 --> 05:33.261
Are the girls in the game?

05:33.328 --> 05:35.763
- You mean Britta?
- No, I don't mean Britta.

05:35.831 --> 05:38.599
Did I say Britta?
Twice now.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.234
Chess club!

05:40.302 --> 05:42.336
No, no, no!

05:42.404 --> 05:44.906
He's a pawn.

05:53.816 --> 05:56.017
Checkmate, bitches.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.257
And tell the drama club

06:02.324 --> 06:04.359
Their tears will be real today.

06:07.329 --> 06:09.797
No, that's all sugar, man!
Get some protein.

06:09.865 --> 06:11.465
- Right here. Peanuts.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:11.533 --> 06:12.899
Peanuts, peanuts.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.968
No, take the stuff out
closer to you!

06:15.036 --> 06:17.270
No, no. The ones
in the back are the freshest.

06:17.338 --> 06:19.806
That'll keep us going.
Yeah.

06:19.874 --> 06:23.076
- Hey! What the hell?
- I got you covered, bro.

06:23.144 --> 06:25.812
You guys formed
an alliance without me?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.914
- Yeah.
You with star-burns?

06:27.982 --> 06:29.983
Not if I can be with you.

06:30.051 --> 06:32.485
Ow!

06:32.553 --> 06:34.053
- Ha. It's just star-burns.

06:34.121 --> 06:35.221
Anyone else need a pee break?

06:35.288 --> 06:36.756
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:36.824 --> 06:38.391
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:38.459 --> 06:40.426
I'll stand guard.
I don't need to pee.

06:40.494 --> 06:42.227
I'm wearing a diaper
for the game.

06:42.295 --> 06:44.530
Oh, yeah.
"for the game."

06:47.167 --> 06:48.634
Hey, guys, make this quick

06:48.702 --> 06:51.137
Before Pierce's chewing
attracts enemies.

07:11.592 --> 07:13.126
Um, guys?

07:13.194 --> 07:14.861
- Hold it!
- Don't move!

07:14.929 --> 07:16.429
Drop it!

07:17.497 --> 07:20.499
Freeze, mamma jamma!

07:28.124 --> 07:30.593
All right, everybody be cool.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.161
We can beat the others
if we merge alliances.

07:32.229 --> 07:33.662
We're doing fine on our own.

07:33.730 --> 07:35.698
Yeah? You gonna win the whole
game camped on a crapper?

07:35.766 --> 07:36.733
- Worked on you.
- Did it?

07:36.801 --> 07:37.934
Or do you have
a gun in your face?

07:38.002 --> 07:39.736
- Yeah, kinda matches yours.
- Nice comeback.

07:39.804 --> 07:41.237
Shut up!

07:41.305 --> 07:44.374
- Jeez!
- Jeez!

07:52.450 --> 07:55.486
Okay. So the agreement
is we're allies

07:55.554 --> 07:57.955
Until we're sure we're
the last seven standing.

07:59.792 --> 08:01.426
You thinking what I'm thinking?

08:01.494 --> 08:04.296
- Mm-hmm. Our team's
walking with God.

08:04.363 --> 08:06.765
I'm thinking we might already
be the only seven left,

08:06.832 --> 08:08.867
In which case, this is
a window for the two of us

08:08.935 --> 08:10.202
To take out the others.

08:10.269 --> 08:11.903
Real nice, Troy.

08:11.971 --> 08:13.538
That'd be great p.R.
For the black students.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.374
<i>I am not an ambassador.</i>

08:16.442 --> 08:18.243
I am gladiator.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.612
Now, you want to win or not?

08:20.680 --> 08:22.747
Oh...Oh!

08:22.815 --> 08:25.216
Troy made God mad!

08:25.284 --> 08:27.352
Take cover!

08:29.188 --> 08:33.057
Run, Pierce!

08:33.125 --> 08:35.126
* la la la *

08:35.193 --> 08:37.996
* la la la la la la la la la *

08:38.063 --> 08:39.197
Glee club.

08:39.265 --> 08:40.398
How do you know
it's the glee club?

08:40.466 --> 08:41.499
Listen.

08:41.566 --> 08:44.468
- * la *
- * La *

08:44.536 --> 08:45.937
* hit me with your best shot *

08:46.004 --> 08:47.404
Oh, brother!

08:47.472 --> 08:49.106
* why don't you
hit me with your best shot *

08:49.174 --> 08:51.909
That is so uninspired!

08:51.976 --> 08:53.477
I'm not so sure.

08:55.346 --> 08:57.748
I got a plan.
Get ready.

08:57.816 --> 08:59.649
Hey, Pierce.

08:59.717 --> 09:01.651
Don't come over here, okay?

09:01.719 --> 09:04.520
Screw you!
I'm coming over there.

09:07.657 --> 09:09.825
Medic!

09:09.892 --> 09:12.595
In the trees!
There!

09:23.441 --> 09:26.811
Write some original songs!

09:26.878 --> 09:29.848
What are you guys gonna do

09:29.916 --> 09:31.650
If you win
priority registration?

09:31.718 --> 09:34.019
I'll make my schedule airtight.

09:34.086 --> 09:36.488
Maybe get out of here
in three years instead of four.

09:36.555 --> 09:39.825
I'd take any class
with no tests and no papers.

09:39.892 --> 09:42.562
What would you do, Shirley?

09:42.629 --> 09:44.631
I'd choose all morning classes

09:44.698 --> 09:47.434
So I could get home early
to spend some time with my boys.

09:47.501 --> 09:50.003
It's hard being away
from them so much.

09:50.070 --> 09:51.304
You know what?

09:51.372 --> 09:53.306
I say if any of us
win the prize,

09:53.374 --> 09:55.208
We give it to Shirley
as a mother's day gift.

09:55.276 --> 09:57.411
- Absolutely.
- What?

09:57.478 --> 09:58.745
Abed, you don't
have to do that.

09:58.813 --> 10:00.814
I am so sick of you
guilting people

10:00.882 --> 10:02.716
With your phony
humanitarian schtick.

10:02.784 --> 10:05.219
Phony? When I win,
you can watch me do it.

10:05.286 --> 10:06.420
Of course you'll do it,

10:06.488 --> 10:07.688
But that won't make it
less phony.

10:07.755 --> 10:09.089
You know, you'd be
a lot more likeable--

10:09.157 --> 10:10.557
- If I never did anything
for anybody ever?

10:10.625 --> 10:12.159
Yeah. Because
when you help people,

10:12.226 --> 10:14.328
That always turns out great.

10:14.395 --> 10:16.062
Let's do it.

10:18.566 --> 10:19.699
Shh!

10:19.767 --> 10:21.167
Study group!

10:21.235 --> 10:23.970
Come out and play!

10:24.038 --> 10:26.640
- Oh, look,
it's post-ironic disco st...

10:26.707 --> 10:28.341
You still
trying to bring it back?

10:28.409 --> 10:30.076
Hi!

10:30.144 --> 10:31.344
- Wha-ha!

10:31.411 --> 10:33.613
Damn, he brought it back.

10:35.015 --> 10:36.081
Ooh!

10:36.149 --> 10:37.216
Aah!

10:37.284 --> 10:38.417
- Can you--aah?

10:38.485 --> 10:40.519
- The lord is my Shepherd...
- Ugh!

10:40.587 --> 10:42.088
I shall not want.

10:43.357 --> 10:44.657
Aah!

10:44.725 --> 10:46.058
Whoo!

10:46.126 --> 10:47.126
Here we come!

10:48.195 --> 10:49.228
Three stooges gonna--

10:50.431 --> 10:52.398
Aah!

10:52.466 --> 10:55.602
They shot us!
Waste of time, waste of time!

10:55.670 --> 10:57.672
Let's go, fool!

11:04.513 --> 11:06.481
The last guy almost got me.

11:11.254 --> 11:12.320
* *

11:12.388 --> 11:13.455
My legs.

11:17.527 --> 11:20.728
Oh, Shirley, I'm so sorry.

11:20.796 --> 11:23.232
I'm going home, Britta.

11:23.299 --> 11:24.866
I know, Shirley, I know.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.935
No, seriously, I'm going home.

11:27.003 --> 11:27.936
Can you help me up?

11:28.003 --> 11:29.770
Oh. Yeah, sure.

11:31.406 --> 11:32.406
Oh!

11:45.551 --> 11:46.951
Shirley, I'm gonna win
that prize

11:47.019 --> 11:47.985
For you and your boys.

11:48.053 --> 11:49.420
That's nice.

11:49.488 --> 11:51.256
Shirley, I'm gonna
win that prize,

11:51.323 --> 11:52.390
But not for you and your boys.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.459
That's less nice.

11:54.527 --> 11:57.128
Oh, my God, you've been hit.

11:57.196 --> 11:58.663
What? Oh, no.

11:58.731 --> 11:59.664
Wait, wait.

12:01.467 --> 12:03.168
It's blood.

12:03.235 --> 12:05.737
I thought it was paint,
but I'm just bleeding.

12:05.805 --> 12:08.940
Talk about luck, ooh.

12:09.008 --> 12:11.944
I can't believe
this game is still going on.

12:12.011 --> 12:13.178
It's 2:00 A.M.!

12:13.246 --> 12:14.447
What if someone gets hurt

12:14.514 --> 12:15.682
And the police come?

12:15.749 --> 12:17.317
They'll think I'm a bad dean!

12:17.385 --> 12:19.887
There's classes in the morning.

12:19.954 --> 12:21.188
This has to stop!

12:21.256 --> 12:22.490
Shh.

12:24.059 --> 12:25.760
Put me in the game,

12:25.828 --> 12:27.395
'cause I'll take everyone out.

12:27.463 --> 12:29.831
I play paintball
three times a week, bro.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.132
I'm even
one of those douche bags

12:31.200 --> 12:32.501
That brings in
his own equipment.

12:32.569 --> 12:33.769
But it wouldn't be fair.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.937
You're not a student.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.805
But you can change that,
can't you?

12:36.873 --> 12:38.040
Huh?

12:38.107 --> 12:40.409
Enroll me in a class.

12:50.788 --> 12:52.221
What are your interests?

12:52.289 --> 12:53.423
Arts and crafts.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.225
- Oh, I do watercolors.
- Oh, cool.

13:00.264 --> 13:02.132
The group would be thrilled.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.901
The wounded soldier fantasy

13:03.968 --> 13:05.736
Means we're moments
from doing it, right?

13:05.804 --> 13:07.372
Yeah, can you feel
that tension?

13:07.439 --> 13:10.541
It's a miracle
we still have clothes on.

13:12.010 --> 13:14.310
You're right, you know.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.879
I am a phony.

13:16.947 --> 13:18.714
I try to act compassionate,

13:18.782 --> 13:20.683
Because I'm afraid
that I'm not.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.818
Oh, please, I invented phony.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.486
You care about people.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.820
I accuse you of faking

13:25.888 --> 13:27.321
To convince myself
I'm not such a jerk.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.689
Jeff, you help people
more than I do,

13:29.757 --> 13:31.358
And you don't even want to.

13:31.425 --> 13:32.692
You're not--
you're not a jerk.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.760
You're fine.

13:35.429 --> 13:36.997
Especially
now that I've repaired

13:37.064 --> 13:38.164
Your overworked torso

13:38.232 --> 13:40.233
With my trembling
feminine fingers.

13:40.300 --> 13:42.901
Yes. Too...Much...
Sexual..Tension!

13:42.969 --> 13:44.669
Dam...Bursting!

13:44.737 --> 13:46.404
- Blah blah!
- Aaah!

13:46.471 --> 13:47.905
You know, it would
totally serve them right

13:47.973 --> 13:49.940
If we did it here
in the study room.

13:50.008 --> 13:51.008
Oh, my God, could you imagine?

13:51.076 --> 13:52.409
I can't stop imagining.

13:52.477 --> 13:53.844
Neither can I.

13:53.912 --> 13:55.812
Baaah Aaaah!

14:03.006 --> 14:04.173
We should get dressed

14:04.241 --> 14:06.175
Before the third-shift
librarian shows up.

14:06.243 --> 14:07.444
Yeah, we don't want this

14:07.512 --> 14:09.579
<i>To turn into
a letter to penthouse, right?</i>

14:09.647 --> 14:11.381
I think the group is right.

14:11.449 --> 14:12.883
We did need
to relieve some tension.

14:16.955 --> 14:18.521
Please tell me
you didn't have sex with me

14:18.589 --> 14:19.956
To win at paintball.

14:20.024 --> 14:21.091
No, I had sex with you,

14:21.159 --> 14:22.959
And now I'm gonna win
at paintball.

14:23.027 --> 14:24.361
<i>Don't be gross.
I'm gross?</i>

14:24.428 --> 14:26.931
You seem pretty practiced
at putting on panties one-handed

14:26.998 --> 14:28.199
While holding a gun.

14:28.267 --> 14:33.905
Can I get dressed
before you assassinate me?

14:33.973 --> 14:37.809
So all that happened,
it meant nothing to you?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.678
I didn't say that.

14:39.746 --> 14:40.880
What did it mean to you?

14:40.947 --> 14:42.515
- I asked you first.
- Very mature.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.150
Said the woman wearing
the hello Kitty underwear.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.819
Said the woman holding the gun.

14:47.088 --> 14:49.089
You sure that's a gun?

14:49.157 --> 14:52.126
'cause maybe it's a metaphor
for your fake, jaded persona.

14:52.194 --> 14:54.328
Uh-oh.

14:54.396 --> 14:57.698
No paintballs, Hans?
What do you think, I'm stupid?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.567
- When'd you take my clip?
- When you started seducing me.

14:59.634 --> 15:02.336
I wasn't though! Assuming that
makes you way grosser.

15:02.404 --> 15:03.371
Not when I'm right.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.000
<i>Buenos dias, children.</i>

15:33.068 --> 15:34.101
You'll be happy to know

15:34.169 --> 15:35.436
You made it
all the way till the end.

15:35.503 --> 15:36.570
You're not even a student!

15:36.638 --> 15:37.871
Wrong!

15:37.939 --> 15:40.908
Critical media literacy
and politics of gender, biatch!

15:44.612 --> 15:46.280
Give me your clip.

15:46.347 --> 15:47.949
Oh, yeah, that would be
brilliant of me.

15:48.016 --> 15:50.485
Look, you got the drop on me.
I lost.

15:50.552 --> 15:51.752
Let me do this for you.

15:59.996 --> 16:02.231
Be pretty crazy
if I shot you right now, huh?

16:06.637 --> 16:11.074
* *

16:36.231 --> 16:38.433
What's so funny, Chang?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.202
Maybe it's the fact
there's no such thing

16:40.269 --> 16:42.638
As priority registration.

16:42.705 --> 16:46.543
Or...Maybe it's this.

16:46.610 --> 16:47.611
Ta-DA!

17:13.105 --> 17:14.105
Dean!

17:17.041 --> 17:18.977
Just one moment.

17:22.013 --> 17:23.315
Oh, hi there, Jeffrey.

17:26.051 --> 17:27.286
That's a good look for you.

17:27.353 --> 17:30.323
Everybody out there
is shooting each other

17:30.390 --> 17:31.457
For nothing

17:31.525 --> 17:34.660
While you sit here

17:34.727 --> 17:36.395
In your ivory tower.

17:36.462 --> 17:38.496
Jeffrey, I can explain.

17:38.564 --> 17:40.799
I messed up when I promised
priority registration.

17:40.866 --> 17:43.768
Apparently, it's a violation
of some student equality act,

17:43.835 --> 17:45.469
But...

17:45.536 --> 17:46.470
This isn't.

17:46.537 --> 17:47.504
Ta-DA!

17:47.572 --> 17:49.405
- Okay, now,
it's not blu-ray,

17:49.473 --> 17:51.640
But it comes
with its own remote, so...

17:51.708 --> 17:54.343
Aah!

17:55.713 --> 17:56.846
Jeffrey!

17:56.914 --> 17:59.648
Aaah!

17:59.716 --> 18:01.016
Jeffrey!

18:02.219 --> 18:03.653
Jeffrey!

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
Jeffrey!

18:12.663 --> 18:14.397
You get it all
out of your system?

18:22.739 --> 18:24.573
Almost.

18:27.977 --> 18:30.246
What do you want
from me, Jeffrey?

18:30.313 --> 18:32.047
Guess.

18:40.023 --> 18:42.225
- Oh, hi,
- Hey, how's it going?

18:42.292 --> 18:44.726
You still have some, uh, paint.

18:44.794 --> 18:45.828
Oh, thanks.

18:45.895 --> 18:47.329
Um, so I was thinking...

18:47.397 --> 18:49.264
- You don't even have to.
- It didn't happen.

18:49.332 --> 18:50.465
It's not that it was a mistake.

18:50.533 --> 18:51.566
It's just that
it didn't happen.

18:51.634 --> 18:53.101
It was a crazy night
of paintball.

18:53.168 --> 18:54.469
Exactly.
Tension relieving.

18:54.536 --> 18:56.404
Absolutely. No need
to mention it to anyone.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.305
Right, no big deal.
Nothing's changed.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.242
Something's changed.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.643
Oh, Abed.

19:03.711 --> 19:05.578
Crazy Abed.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.612
No, something's different now.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.612
Could be me.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.980
I'm sporting a man-thong.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.014
Maybe.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.482
Or maybe it's that

19:11.550 --> 19:14.252
I have emerged victorious

19:14.319 --> 19:16.921
With a priority
registration form.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.322
Ohh!

19:18.390 --> 19:20.024
Well done, Jeff.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.260
And in recognition
of her bravery,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.429
Not to mention her children,

19:24.497 --> 19:25.730
I hereby award this

19:25.797 --> 19:27.632
To the best soldier, Shirley.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.633
Ohh!

19:28.701 --> 19:30.001
Now, the bad news is,

19:30.069 --> 19:31.303
For legal purposes,
next semester,

19:31.371 --> 19:34.106
If anybody asks, you have gout.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.341
Do you mind
walking with a limp?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.977
Mm.
Thank you, Jeffrey.

19:38.045 --> 19:39.045
Look, honey.

19:39.113 --> 19:41.014
Wow, I didn't see that coming.

19:41.081 --> 19:42.649
Neither did I.

19:42.716 --> 19:44.184
So no one feels it?

19:44.251 --> 19:45.818
No one senses
anything's different?

19:45.886 --> 19:46.819
Nope.

19:46.887 --> 19:47.887
Not at all.

19:47.955 --> 19:50.223
It's riding up a little.

19:56.529 --> 20:02.298
