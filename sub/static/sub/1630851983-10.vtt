00:17.476 --> 00:20.646
We've made a major breakthrough
in our search for life.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.147
Because of Charlie Brown,

00:22.231 --> 00:25.651
we've discovered an asteroid
passing through our solar system.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.653
Sorry, everyone.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.280
We're thanking you, you blockhead!

00:31.323 --> 00:33.242
In that case, you're welcome.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.745
Everything in our solar system
orbits in one direction,

00:36.828 --> 00:40.874
but Franklin noticed this asteroid
is moving the opposite way.

00:40.958 --> 00:46.088
And that means it must have come from
a different solar system,

00:46.171 --> 00:49.091
which makes it an interstellar traveler.

00:49.174 --> 00:53.011
This is not the kind of
interstellar traveler I signed up for.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.888
Where are the blobby green aliens?

00:54.972 --> 00:57.724
Where are the flying saucers?
Where are the special effects?

00:58.934 --> 01:01.103
This isn't science fiction, Lucy.
This isn't science fiction, Lucy.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.105
It's even better!

01:03.188 --> 01:04.815
For untold epochs,

01:04.897 --> 01:08.819
this asteroid roamed the stars
on a great celestial journey.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.906
Of the billions of solar systems
it could have passed through,

01:12.990 --> 01:15.534
what are the odds it would arrive in ours?

01:16.702 --> 01:20.038
When you put it that way,
I guess it is kind of exciting.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.624
For a rock.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.209
<i>Kind of?</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:26.295
<i>This is incredible!</i>

01:26.378 --> 01:30.716
<i>For years, NASA has been hoping
to find an interstellar traveler</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:34.219
<i>because they could teach us
so much about faraway planets.</i>

01:34.303 --> 01:35.596
<i>Billions of years ago,</i>

01:35.679 --> 01:40.517
<i>the sun's gravitational pull made
bits of dust collide into each other,</i>

01:40.601 --> 01:42.227
<i>like making a snowball.</i>

01:42.311 --> 01:47.441
<i>Some of those bits got bigger and bigger
until they formed the planets,</i>

01:47.524 --> 01:51.278
<i>while the smaller leftover bits
became the asteroids.</i>

01:51.361 --> 01:54.239
<i>Because asteroids aren't protected
by an atmosphere,</i>

01:54.323 --> 01:58.327
<i>they don't have wind or rain
or storms to change them,</i>

01:58.410 --> 02:02.247
<i>which means they've been preserved
since they were formed.</i>
<i>which means they've been preserved
since they were formed.</i>

02:02.331 --> 02:05.667
<i>So, if we were able
to look at one up close,</i>

02:05.751 --> 02:09.922
<i>it could teach us about the materials
present billions of years ago</i>

02:10.005 --> 02:12.007
<i>that allowed the planets to form.</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:15.802
<i>We also believe that asteroids contain
the building blocks of life.</i>

02:15.886 --> 02:21.350
<i>So, this asteroid might even give us
important clues about how life began.</i>

02:21.433 --> 02:24.603
All that thanks to Charlie Brown?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.980
What's the galaxy coming to?

02:27.064 --> 02:30.859
Wait. If we were able to
capture the interstellar traveler,

02:30.943 --> 02:34.571
it could have material on it that tells us
whether life exists somewhere else.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.240
Wow!

02:36.323 --> 02:40.118
<i>That's right.
It would be an amazing breakthrough.</i>

02:40.202 --> 02:42.704
Well, what are we waiting for?

02:42.788 --> 02:44.915
Let's snag us an asteroid.

02:49.044 --> 02:51.421
<i>I love your enthusiasm, gang.</i>

02:51.505 --> 02:56.051
<i>But catching an asteroid
would be extremely difficult.</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:58.595
We'll just have to come up with a plan.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.390
<i>Excellent. Excellent.</i>
<i>Excellent. Excellent.</i>

03:01.473 --> 03:05.519
<i>Whoops. Looks like I need a quick reboot
to clear some computer cobwebs.</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:08.355
<i>This won't take long. Good luck, gang.</i>

03:26.456 --> 03:27.457
I know!

03:27.541 --> 03:31.170
When I wanna catch butterflies,
I use a butterfly net.

03:31.253 --> 03:33.839
Okay. That's a good start.

03:37.885 --> 03:42.139
Unfortunately, it seems this asteroid
is much too big for a net.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.648
Okay, so maybe not a net.

03:51.732 --> 03:55.319
- What are other ways to catch something?
- I've got it.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.780
When cowboys wanna catch something,
they use a lasso.

04:02.618 --> 04:03.827
Yeehaw!

04:06.914 --> 04:08.207
Great idea.

04:11.835 --> 04:16.464
Even for a very skilled cowboy,
the asteroid would be way too fast.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.219
Yeehaw!

04:23.138 --> 04:27.100
I think I'd be more comfortable
with a different approach.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.562
Okay, not that either. What else?

04:30.646 --> 04:32.356
Everyone loves fishing.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.859
If you can catch a fish,
maybe you can catch an asteroid.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.153
Sure. Let's give it a shot.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.045
Nets? Lassos? Fishing poles?

05:37.129 --> 05:39.548
None of these silly ideas will ever work.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.468
<i>You might be surprised, Lucy.</i>

05:43.552 --> 05:47.222
<i>All the methods NASA uses
started out as ideas.</i>

05:47.306 --> 05:49.558
<i>Even ones we take for granted today,</i>

05:49.641 --> 05:52.019
<i>like safely landing people on the moon</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:56.148
<i>or using robots to explore distant space.</i>

05:56.773 --> 06:01.945
<i>Good scientific practice involves testing
many different theoretical solutions,</i>
<i>Good scientific practice involves testing
many different theoretical solutions,</i>

06:02.029 --> 06:04.823
<i>no matter how wild
they might seem at the time.</i>

06:47.991 --> 06:49.284
Hey!

07:04.007 --> 07:06.552
Of course! That's it.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.388
If we could send a craft
to orbit the asteroid,

07:09.471 --> 07:13.141
then we could use the grabbing action
of a robot arm to get a sample.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.895
We don't need the whole asteroid.
We could study a piece of it.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.147
<i>That's a great idea, Franklin.</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:20.816
Really?

07:20.899 --> 07:23.944
<i>It'll take some time
to organize the logistics,</i>

07:24.027 --> 07:27.781
<i>but I'd say you've come up with
a fantastic plan.</i>

07:27.865 --> 07:31.159
<i>NASA will definitely be
putting this mission into place.</i>

07:31.243 --> 07:33.996
<i>What a terrific way to end the day.</i>

07:34.079 --> 07:35.664
Yeehaw!

07:38.375 --> 07:40.419
Thanks for the idea, Snoopy.
