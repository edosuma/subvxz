00:15.580 --> 00:17.452
[squawking]

00:42.651 --> 00:45.045
Victim is Christine Tanner,
15, drowned

00:45.132 --> 00:46.698
washed up on the beach
in Santa Marta.

00:46.785 --> 00:47.917
Who's got the ultraviolet?

00:48.004 --> 00:49.919
Yep. So she drowned.
Why us?

00:50.006 --> 00:52.443
Coroner found a wound consistent
with getting hit in the head

00:52.530 --> 00:55.011
with a surfboard
and water in her lungs.

00:55.098 --> 00:57.927
Only it was ditchwater.
No salt, a lot of bugs.

00:58.014 --> 01:01.235
So the killer is clever, but not
as clever as he thinks he is.

01:01.322 --> 01:03.541
Santa Marta sheriff's
not taking this one?

01:03.628 --> 01:06.414
State beach, state case.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.546
Alright, what are you doing?

01:08.633 --> 01:12.811
Grace is mentally telling me
where she hid the van keys.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.945
If I find them,
I get to drive.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
So now you're psychic?

01:17.947 --> 01:20.210
Oh, no, no, no.
This is all science.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.995
'Concentrate, Grace.'

01:23.083 --> 01:25.607
Tell me with your mind only.

01:25.694 --> 01:30.786
Forward, backward,
left, right.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.266
- How is that science?
- Shh.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.921
He watched you
hide the keys.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.881
From the men's room?
Thatwouldbe a trick.

01:50.849 --> 01:52.286
Hmm.

02:08.824 --> 02:11.131
[laughs]
Who's got shotgun?

02:13.568 --> 02:14.873
Can we go now?

02:27.103 --> 02:30.106
Leah, go ahead.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.307
You had the keys in your hand
the whole time.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.656
You've gotta let it go, man.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.397
Did you have the keys
in your hand?

03:00.484 --> 03:02.399
If I tell you how it's done,
the magic circle will send

03:02.486 --> 03:06.055
a team of assassins
to kill us all. It's the law.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.057
Her body was discovered
on this beach.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.102
Coast guard says that means
she was put in the water

03:10.190 --> 03:11.974
anywhere within a mile
north of here.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.671
Any further along the coast

03:13.758 --> 03:14.890
the current would have
taken her out to Mexico.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.239
How long was she in the water?

03:16.326 --> 03:17.762
We're still waiting
on the coroner's report.

03:28.469 --> 03:32.299
Hey, excuse me.
Are you guys cops?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.736
- CBI.
- What's CBI.?

03:34.823 --> 03:36.781
[Rigsby]
'California bureau
of investigation.'

03:36.868 --> 03:38.130
Cops.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.176
Cops.

03:40.263 --> 03:43.745
So is it true what they're
saying? Somebody killed Chris?

03:43.832 --> 03:47.488
Yes, it is true.

03:47.575 --> 03:48.967
You were Christine's friend?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.926
Yeah.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.885
We hang at the same breaks.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.192
I love Chris.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.715
What happened?

03:57.802 --> 03:59.761
We don't know yet.
What's your name?

03:59.848 --> 04:01.632
I'm Hope. That's Win.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.199
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.767
When was the last time
you saw Christine?

04:05.854 --> 04:08.117
'Uh, three days ago.'

04:08.204 --> 04:12.426
Sunset patrol.
Epic northeast swell.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.515
'Chris loved to go out
at sunset.'

04:14.602 --> 04:17.474
She would stay out
till it was dark as dark.

04:17.561 --> 04:18.736
'How did she seem lately?'

04:18.823 --> 04:22.044
Just, you know,
any enemies or..

04:22.131 --> 04:23.959
...stuff like that?

04:24.046 --> 04:25.961
Uh, not-not around here.

04:26.048 --> 04:27.354
Everybody loved Chris.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.660
- Was she dating anybody?
- Dating?

04:29.747 --> 04:31.706
Okay, was she hooking up
with anybody in particular?

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
Danny Kurtik, mostly.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.144
Jeez, Hope.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.581
What? They were hookin' up.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.193
Danny would never hurt Chris.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.849
Duh, of course not. That's not
what they were asking.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.851
They were asking who
she was hooking up with

04:46.938 --> 04:50.812
which would be Danny.
It wasn't a big, dark secret.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.466
I need you to write down
your names

04:52.553 --> 04:54.859
and the numbers
we can reach you at.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.731
- Win?
- Yeah?

04:56.818 --> 04:58.602
If Chris was a color,
what color would she be?

04:58.689 --> 05:01.562
Uh, orange...or pink.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.259
No, o-orange is right.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.435
If she were an animal, what kind
of animal would she be?

05:05.522 --> 05:07.742
Uh, I don't know.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.178
A rabbit?

05:11.485 --> 05:14.662
How is this relevant?

05:14.749 --> 05:16.490
Everything's relevant.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.277
Chris was good people.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.323
I hope you find
who did this.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.063
We'll do our best.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.720
Howisthat relevant?

05:29.807 --> 05:31.940
We're looking for someone
who doesn't like orange rabbits.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.507
Exactly.

05:33.594 --> 05:37.293
You know what, boys?
I like it here.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.904
Yeah. I think
I'll stay for a while.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.341
What?

05:44.605 --> 05:45.780
Okay.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.088
Ah.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.786
Let's just leave him here.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.807
[male #1]
'Excuse the mess.'

06:12.894 --> 06:15.026
'Chrissy was the house-proud
one around here.'

06:15.113 --> 06:19.117
- We understand. Mr. Tanner?
- Huh?

06:19.204 --> 06:22.077
We may have to ask you
some tough questions, so..

06:25.950 --> 06:27.561
That's okay.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.954
Can't tell Lisa nothing
she hasn't heard before

06:30.041 --> 06:31.260
and Micah don't..

06:31.347 --> 06:33.305
'He don't give a damn.
He's slow.'

06:33.393 --> 06:37.135
He's just...sad
'cause he sees Lisa is.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.398
All the same.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.576
- Come on, kids.
- Come on, Micah. Let's go.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.841
- 'Can you take him outside?'
- 'You got it, dad.'

06:46.928 --> 06:48.973
'Come on. Let's go outside.'

06:53.151 --> 06:55.197
So when did you notice
Christine was missing?

06:55.284 --> 06:56.938
Yesterday morning.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.330
She hadn't made nothing
for the kids

06:58.418 --> 07:00.811
and I realized
I hadn't seen her in a while.

07:00.898 --> 07:03.292
I mean, she may be away
one night and I wouldn't know,

07:03.379 --> 07:04.641
but you know..

07:04.728 --> 07:06.774
When was the last time
you saw her?

07:06.861 --> 07:08.384
Monday morning.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.647
Any idea where she was
during that time period?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.562
No. No. Chrissy's
real independent.

07:12.649 --> 07:16.784
You never...never had
to worry about Chrissy.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.786
So two days to notice
your daughter's gone

07:18.873 --> 07:20.309
and another to report it.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.919
I work.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.096
I mean, I work construction.
I never miss a day.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.142
I-I can't watch her
all the time.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.100
Her mother's not around?

07:29.187 --> 07:30.885
She died.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.627
She was killed
in a car wreck.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.629
[Van Pelt]
'I'm sorry.'

07:35.716 --> 07:38.196
Heh. Almost five
years ago now.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.330
Drunk driver T-boned her.

07:41.417 --> 07:43.158
'College kid.'

07:43.245 --> 07:46.030
'Walked away laughin'.'

07:46.117 --> 07:49.077
Not a scratch, you know?

07:49.164 --> 07:50.905
Not a scratch.

07:54.343 --> 07:58.303
So Christine kind of took over
for her mom, huh?

07:58.390 --> 08:01.002
Cooked, cleaned,
looked after the little ones?

08:01.089 --> 08:02.830
'Yeah.'

08:02.917 --> 08:05.093
'Don't know what
we're gonna do now.'

08:05.180 --> 08:07.182
Christine was arrested
last year?

08:07.269 --> 08:09.750
That was...stupid.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.926
It was a couple of joints.
No big deal.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.363
Well, how is it
she got into drugs?

08:14.450 --> 08:16.757
She wasn't into drugs. She was
straightedge, if anything.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.672
It's her dumb-ass friend
Darlene.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.457
Darlene? Last name?

08:21.544 --> 08:24.634
Pappas, but Chrissy
wasn't hanging out much

08:24.721 --> 08:27.594
with Darlene anymore, not since
she got big into surfing.

08:27.681 --> 08:28.899
Then she started hanging
with a different crowd.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.553
'Who were they?'

08:30.640 --> 08:32.337
'They're surfers, you know,
not like bum surfers.'

08:32.424 --> 08:34.426
They seem like good kids,
you know?'

08:34.514 --> 08:36.254
They were upscale.

08:36.341 --> 08:39.649
They'd pick her up in their,
their Audis and whatnot.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.782
You know, they were
a good influence on Christine.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.392
They helped her
with her schoolwork

08:43.479 --> 08:45.699
and she was thinking
about college.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.527
Anybody in particular
she was close to?

08:47.614 --> 08:50.921
I don't really know 'em.
I mean, there's names I'd hear

08:51.008 --> 08:53.141
all the time. There's, like,
Andy and Danny and Hope

08:53.228 --> 08:56.797
'and then there's
this new guy, Flipper'

08:56.884 --> 08:58.276
'she talked about lately.'

08:58.363 --> 08:59.451
Talks about how?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.888
'Just that she was, you know,'

09:00.975 --> 09:02.585
they were hangin' together,
you know?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.718
Like, "I'll see you
at Flipper's," stuff like that.

09:04.805 --> 09:05.806
[door opens]

09:05.893 --> 09:08.635
Hey, Lisa? Honey?

09:08.722 --> 09:09.984
'Yeah, dad?'

09:10.071 --> 09:12.247
Hey, honey, could you, uh,
fix some lunch

09:12.334 --> 09:13.553
for your brother, please?

09:13.640 --> 09:14.902
Yeah, okay.

09:14.989 --> 09:15.903
Thanks.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.214
[indistinct chatter]

09:28.742 --> 09:30.091

'No, I saw it.'

09:30.178 --> 09:32.572
[female #1]
'They're further
down the beach.'

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
What, you didn't bring
a bucket?

10:16.093 --> 10:17.051
Are you okay?

10:17.138 --> 10:20.010
'Damn it.'

10:20.097 --> 10:21.751
It's gotta be tough.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.536
- What?
- I mean, a drunk driver..

10:24.624 --> 10:28.410
Isn't that what happened
to your mother?

10:28.497 --> 10:30.717
Sorry. It's not my business.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.589
We don't discuss
our personal lives in this unit.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.026
It's not useful,
and it's not professional.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.638
[cell phone beeps]

10:38.725 --> 10:41.466
Cho, names to check..

10:41.553 --> 10:46.123
...Darlene Pappas, Andy,
Danny, Hope and Flipper.

10:46.210 --> 10:50.693
Flipper? Okay.
Uh-huh.

10:50.780 --> 10:51.912
Got it. Hold on.

10:57.308 --> 10:59.180
There's a Darlene Pappas
in youth authority lockup

10:59.267 --> 11:00.181
possession and resisting arrest.
I'll get her in here.

11:00.268 --> 11:01.225
I'll get her in here.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.967
Great. Where's Jane?

11:04.054 --> 11:06.970
Jane? He's still pursuing
inquiries at the beach.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.669

[cheering]

11:41.526 --> 11:44.834
[Lisbon]
'Darlene, you're a friend
of Christine Tanner?'

11:44.921 --> 11:46.749
What do you want?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.055
Christine's dead.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.973
What do you want?

11:53.060 --> 11:56.106
I want you to help us
find out who killed her.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.761
Killed? How?

11:58.848 --> 12:01.285
- Drowned.
- Drowned?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.939
Damn.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.072
Who does she know that might
have reason to do this?

12:09.032 --> 12:12.775
Well, now that you mention it,
there was a guy.

12:12.862 --> 12:17.214
What was his name?

12:17.301 --> 12:19.042
Yes, Darlene,
if you help us

12:19.129 --> 12:21.305
I'll talk to the prosecutor,
see if we can help you

12:21.392 --> 12:23.960
with these charges
you've got pending.

12:24.047 --> 12:27.398
Okay.

12:27.485 --> 12:31.054
Last year she was
banging an older guy

12:31.141 --> 12:33.709
like old.
She called him "Pops."

12:33.796 --> 12:35.580
No name? Just Pops?

12:35.667 --> 12:38.322
Pops, that's it.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.847
One time, uh, she said
he was getting weird

12:40.934 --> 12:41.978
and she was talking
about dumping him

12:42.065 --> 12:44.111
but I don't know
if she ever did.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.374
Like I say, we haven't been
tight for a while now.

12:46.461 --> 12:50.073
That's interesting, but it's not
enough for a call to the DA.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.207
'Did she say anything else
about him? Anything at all?'

12:54.599 --> 12:56.340
Uh..

12:56.427 --> 12:58.560
...he was good in bed

12:58.647 --> 13:02.042
and he liked '50's music

13:02.129 --> 13:03.957
like Elvis and stuff.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.219
I mean, that's it.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.266
Well, that's enough, right?

13:09.353 --> 13:10.311
[door opens]

13:10.398 --> 13:11.442
Well, call the DA!

on a woman a few years back.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.933
- How bad?
- Hundred stitches bad.

13:24.020 --> 13:25.326
- 'Got an address.'
- Let's go.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.598
[rock music]

13:56.096 --> 13:57.619
Philip Handler? Police!

13:57.706 --> 13:59.795
May we speak
with you, please?

13:59.882 --> 14:01.797
[music continues]

14:05.148 --> 14:06.236
Mr. Handler?

14:06.323 --> 14:07.455
Clear.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.726
Mr. Handler?

14:17.813 --> 14:21.251
Hey. These friends of yours?

14:21.338 --> 14:23.645
Oh! Hey, guys,
come in. Come in.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.213
I'm just about to discredit
Nimzovich's Theory

14:26.300 --> 14:28.824
on the French advance
once and for all.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.608
- Dream on, trick.
- Huh.

14:33.655 --> 14:34.743
Huh?

14:34.830 --> 14:36.745
[laughing]

14:40.880 --> 14:45.275
[instrumental music]

14:45.362 --> 14:47.277
What led you
to Flipper anyway?

14:47.364 --> 14:50.237
His hair. It's braided the exact
same way as the victim.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.673
'She did his do.'

14:54.241 --> 14:55.503
[sighs]

14:57.244 --> 15:00.769
I guess, uh,
you must be bad cop.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.423
I try.

15:02.510 --> 15:06.079
Tough. Go to it, sister.

15:06.166 --> 15:08.559
You can be pretty
tough yourself.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.692
Roberta Varnushi.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.128
You did quite a number on her.

15:12.215 --> 15:16.393
Uh, we had
different expectations..

15:16.480 --> 15:19.744
...that led
to friction.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.138
But, um, what can you do?

15:22.225 --> 15:24.532
Friction? She nearly died.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.055
Do you know
what she was doing

15:26.142 --> 15:29.102
that started the argument
when I hit her?

15:29.189 --> 15:31.539
She was pouring
the sump oil from her car

15:31.626 --> 15:34.411
right into
the storm drain, okay?

15:34.498 --> 15:35.760
You might as well take an axe

15:35.847 --> 15:38.720
and go chop up
a family of dolphins.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.115
Was Christine Tanner
damaging marine life somehow?

15:42.202 --> 15:44.944
What? No.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.381
Chris understood.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.861
Chris was a child
of the ocean.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.646
You like hanging out
with children, don't you?

15:53.256 --> 15:54.954
I do.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.782
They're pure
in flesh and spirit.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.002
What's not to like?

16:01.569 --> 16:03.440
Christine was
a beautiful girl.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.487
Yes, she was.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.792
So why'd you kill her?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.755
I didn't kill her.

16:13.842 --> 16:14.974
Why would I kill her?

16:15.061 --> 16:16.279
Did you have sex with her?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.979
Oh, I thought about it.

16:20.066 --> 16:23.112
I thought about it a lot.
But no, I didn't.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.635
- You know why?
- Why?

16:24.722 --> 16:26.986
Because it would
be wrong

16:27.073 --> 16:29.553
and I'm all about
doing what's right.

16:29.640 --> 16:34.036
I wait until they hit
legal age, then bam!

16:35.037 --> 16:37.953
Happy birthday, baby.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.955
When was the last time
you saw her?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.523
Oh, so you can try
and pin this on me?

16:42.610 --> 16:45.700
No, thanks.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.268
See, the thing is, Flip,
Lisbon here is looking at you

16:48.355 --> 16:50.835
like you're a porkchop
because you fit the profile.

16:50.922 --> 16:53.969
Your life is in chaos.
You're lonely. You're depressed.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.884
You're addicted to drugs
and pornography

16:55.971 --> 16:58.191
and a little nuts,
to be honest.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.627
'You're exactly
the kind of man'

16:59.714 --> 17:01.237
'that does terrible
things to women.'

17:08.418 --> 17:12.118
Uh, but I don't think
you did this.

17:12.205 --> 17:15.251
''Cause I think deep down
you're a good man.'

17:15.338 --> 17:16.992
You should learn
to use your bishops

17:17.079 --> 17:22.345
a little more efficiently,
but otherwise a good man.

17:22.432 --> 17:25.653
I saw Chris
three days ago..

17:25.740 --> 17:28.351
...Sunset Patrol
at Devon Point Break.

17:28.438 --> 17:32.225
Was that Monday with Hope
and Win and those guys?

17:32.312 --> 17:34.749
Right.
We, we rode until dark

17:34.836 --> 17:37.926
and then we partied
a while on the beach.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.626
And then I went home.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.455
On my mother's life.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.635
What do you mean,
person of interest?

17:51.722 --> 17:53.289
This guy kill
my Chrissy or what?

17:53.376 --> 17:54.812
Mr. Tanner,
if we make an arrest

17:54.899 --> 17:56.945
you'll be the first person
I call, I promise.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.688
I'm gonna have
somebody take you home.

18:02.820 --> 18:03.995
This him?
Is this him?

18:07.216 --> 18:09.000
Calm down, okay?
You need to go home

18:09.088 --> 18:10.350
and take care
of your children.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.048
You're dead, bastard!
You're dead!

18:13.135 --> 18:15.398
You're dead,
you bastard! Ohh!

18:15.485 --> 18:18.184
Go home now!

18:18.271 --> 18:19.359
Look at me.

18:20.708 --> 18:21.622
'Look at me.'

18:23.145 --> 18:25.669
Look at me.
You need to go home.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.845
[sobbing]

18:30.674 --> 18:31.806
Let's go home, daddy.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.725
[sniffles]

18:37.812 --> 18:38.943
'Come on.'

18:44.079 --> 18:45.994
[cellphone ringing]

18:48.214 --> 18:49.432
Lisbon.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.525
Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.007
Coroner just told me
that Christine's body

18:59.094 --> 19:01.488
was put in the water
sometime early Tuesday morning.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.664
'So that Monday night
party is critical.'

19:03.751 --> 19:06.014
Somebody there had to have known
what happened later that night.

19:06.101 --> 19:07.407
Okay, boss, we're on it.

19:11.976 --> 19:14.892
[school bell ringing]

19:18.331 --> 19:19.810
Hi, people.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.986
Oh, thank you
very much, ma'am

19:22.073 --> 19:24.685
but, uh, we don't need
a grief counselor.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.121
We know how to grieve.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.210
Good, because I'm not
a grief counselor.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.385
The principal didn't want
to say "homicide detective"

19:29.472 --> 19:31.779
in front
of the other students.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.824
Agent Lisbon, California
bureau of investigation.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.131
Hey, guys.
Hope and Win I know.

19:36.218 --> 19:39.874
You must be
Danny and Andy. Quick test.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.441
If you could be any animal you
want what would you be? Quick.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.964
Dolphin.

19:43.051 --> 19:44.313
[Patrick]
'You?'

19:44.400 --> 19:47.055
Uh, same, or, uh,
a killer whale.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.057
A gull.
No, a hawk.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.102
Uh, uh, a tiger.

19:52.452 --> 19:55.542
- Interesting.
- Why?

19:55.629 --> 19:58.197
When we spoke before about
Monday night at Devon Point

19:58.284 --> 20:00.416
you didn't mention that you had
a party after you went surfing.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.724
A party?
No, it wasn't a party.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.073
Not what Flipper says.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.642
Flipper told? Dude.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.818
Come on, guys. I mean,
we-we partied

20:10.905 --> 20:13.647
threw a little frisbee.
What's the big deal?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.301
No big deal. It's just that
you were the last people

20:15.388 --> 20:17.912
aside from her killer,
to see Christine alive.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.044
She was drowned
later that night.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.437
- That night?
- You serious?

20:21.524 --> 20:22.873
Oh, my God.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.658
[school bell ringing]

20:24.745 --> 20:28.270
Um, sorry, we have to go.
We have AP English.

20:28.357 --> 20:29.532
We'll walk you.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.450
'So tell us about
this party Monday night.'

20:34.537 --> 20:36.713
You didn't say anything
about it before. Why?

20:36.800 --> 20:39.194
And don't lie
or I'll know.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.630
- We were drinking beer, ma'am.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.371
- Shut up.
- What?

20:42.458 --> 20:44.286
We're all gonna be applying
for college soon, alright?

20:44.373 --> 20:45.331
We can't get caught
for drinking.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.376
My mom would exterminate me.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.074
Plus we were trespassing.
The beach at Devon Point

20:50.161 --> 20:53.382
is totally,
uh, private property.

20:53.469 --> 20:57.430
Danny, what does
Devon Point mean to you?

20:57.517 --> 21:00.302
Uh, it's,
it's my dad's land

21:00.389 --> 21:02.913
and, uh, he's building
these heinous condos.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.089
We go there
to spite him, I guess.

21:05.176 --> 21:06.874
Who else was there
that night?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.398
Us and Flipper, that's all.
It wasn't exactly raging.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.706
We all cut out
about 10:00, 10:30 maybe.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.229
Chris stayed to clean up.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.536
She's all, uh
"save our oceans, " you know?

21:16.623 --> 21:18.233
Did Flipper leave then, too?

21:18.320 --> 21:21.280
He cut out early,
after we ran out of brews.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.716
Do you think
he came back, maybe?

21:22.803 --> 21:24.935
Like, Flipper
did it? No.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.807
We shouldn't have
left her there, guys.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.897
She wanted to stay. You ask me,
she was meeting somebody.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.551
Shut up, Hope.
You don't know that.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.902
No, but I think it,
and so do you.

21:34.989 --> 21:37.339
Danny asked her to go home
with him, and she said no.

21:38.906 --> 21:41.256
You and Chris
were lovers?

21:41.343 --> 21:44.215
Lovers? Uh, no.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.260
We hooked up on occasion.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.870
You made love.
You were lovers.

21:46.957 --> 21:50.657
No. Uh, I mean, Andy was totally
there, too, right, Andy?

21:50.744 --> 21:52.180
Yeah.

21:52.267 --> 21:55.052
It wasn't a big deal.
We're all just friends.

21:55.139 --> 21:56.880
Andy and I hook up
with Hope, too, sometimes.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.361
Doesn't mean we're...lovers.

21:59.448 --> 22:03.017
Yeah.
That would be weird.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.279
Yeah, I guess.

22:05.585 --> 22:10.677
'You ever hear of anyone
named Pops?'

22:10.764 --> 22:12.722
- Pops?
- Yeah.

22:12.809 --> 22:15.421
Uh, no.

22:15.508 --> 22:18.249
Okay. Well, that's all
we need for now. Thank you.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.251
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.731
Don't leave town.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.733
That's a cop joke.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.570
How long you gonna be,
you think?

22:34.657 --> 22:37.225
Mr. Rayburn, Christine Tanner's
murder may have occurred here.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.835
It takes as long as it takes.

22:38.922 --> 22:41.055
I already got the developer
way up my tailpipe.

22:41.142 --> 22:44.275
We're three weeks behind thanks
to the crappy labor pool here.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.495
Economy like this, and people
just don't show up for work?

22:46.582 --> 22:49.803
- Boggles my mind.
- Anybody not show up lately?

22:49.890 --> 22:53.154
[Kyle]
'Night guard just this week
walked off the job.'

22:53.241 --> 22:54.590
'Cement truck shows up
in the morning'

22:54.677 --> 22:56.505
'can't get
on the freakin' site.'

22:56.592 --> 22:58.377
That alone
put me back six hours.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.596
- When did he quit?
- Monday.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.989
What section
are you working then?

23:02.076 --> 23:03.817
Southeast Quad.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.688
What's his name,
the night guard?

23:05.775 --> 23:08.125
Eddie Garcia.
I got his paperwork

23:08.212 --> 23:10.040
in the site office
if you want it.

23:10.127 --> 23:13.392
Jorge! What are you, nuts?
That load goes over here.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.624
- The paperwork?
- Right.

23:28.711 --> 23:30.844
What, you think he might have,
uh, done this murder?

23:30.931 --> 23:32.454
Lisbon!

23:32.541 --> 23:33.760
Come take a look at this.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.286
What?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.597
Oh, yeah.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.035
Mr. Rayburn?

23:54.302 --> 23:57.044
- See that?
- What is it?

23:57.131 --> 23:58.393
Tip of Eddie Garcia's nose.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.396
Get outta here.

24:02.658 --> 24:03.703
Oh!

24:15.802 --> 24:18.369
How is it you don't even notice
a nose in your floor?

24:18.457 --> 24:19.849
That's what I'm telling you.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.503
We're trying to finish
this thing too fast.

24:23.940 --> 24:27.378
What the hell's going on?

24:27.466 --> 24:29.468
Oh, for heaven sakes. Is..

24:29.555 --> 24:31.470
Is that a person,
someone I employ?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.820
We think so.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.778
God help me.
If it's not one thing, it's..

24:35.865 --> 24:38.868
Mr. Kurtik? Dane Kurtik?

24:38.955 --> 24:41.001
Oh, sure.
Right, just talk to my lawyers.

24:41.088 --> 24:43.917
As you saw, I have no knowledge
of this regrettable incident.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.093
CBI. Serious crimes unit.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.747
Serious crimes?

24:47.834 --> 24:49.488
The man fell into wet cement.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.880
If someone had been here
with a camera

24:50.967 --> 24:52.578
he'd be on
"America's Funniest Videos."

24:52.665 --> 24:54.057
Serious crimes? Come on, guys.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.233
I'm sorry, sir.
This is now a crime scene.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.496
You're gonna have
to suspend work

24:57.583 --> 24:59.236
until we're done investigating.

24:59.323 --> 25:03.937
Suspend work? Hell, I'm calling
Tommy Alvarez, the sheriff.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.634
[Patrick]
'We believe this
situation is related'

25:05.721 --> 25:08.594
to the death of
Christine Tanner. You know her?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.074
I've heard the name, obviously.
It's been on the news.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.642
Your son Danny
and Christine were close.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.252
- You never met her?
- Maybe I have.

25:15.339 --> 25:16.602
My son has a lot of friends.

25:16.689 --> 25:17.994
- Is this an interrogation?
- Is it?

25:18.081 --> 25:19.648
No, sir, it isn't.

25:19.735 --> 25:22.259
We appreciate your cooperation.
We'll be in touch, maybe.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.652
Thank you.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.570
Hey, pops?

25:30.137 --> 25:32.008
[instrumental music]

25:34.228 --> 25:36.230
Hear you're good in bed.
What's the secret?

25:36.317 --> 25:38.449
I don't know what
you're talking about

25:38.537 --> 25:40.016
but you mean to be
offensive I guess

25:40.103 --> 25:42.236
and you've succeeded very well.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.368
And I'm going to be taking
this up with your superiors.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.370
- What is your name?
- My name is Patrick Jane.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.590
- Jane, stop.
- And I have no superiors.

25:48.677 --> 25:50.113
And I'll tell you what
I'm talkin' about

25:50.200 --> 25:51.114
you sweaty, little pervert.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.507
Jane!

25:52.594 --> 25:54.030
You were having sex
with a 15-year-old girl.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.336
[Teresa]
'Jane, stop.'

25:55.423 --> 25:56.642
I never touched
Christine Tanner.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.730
Liar.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.341
And believe me when I tell you

26:00.428 --> 26:02.648
that you just now
made the worst mistake

26:02.735 --> 26:05.259
of your miserable little life.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.348
Believe me,
no matter how this turns out

26:07.435 --> 26:09.176
I've made worse mistakes

26:09.263 --> 26:10.699
and you're lying
about Christine Tanner.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.006
You were laying her like carpet.
Arrest him, Lisbon.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.182
- 'Statutory rape.'
- With what evidence?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.578
He's playing "Rockabilly."
'50s music.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.492
What more do you want?

26:21.580 --> 26:24.626
I can only apologize for
my colleague's bizarre behavior.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.193
- I'm sorry.
- Lisbon, hush.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.673
Don't be so damn blinkered.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.544
Look at him.
He was raping her, alright.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.415
I just don't know yet
whether he killed her as well.

26:31.502 --> 26:35.202
Did you kill her? Look me in
the eye and tell me the truth

26:35.289 --> 26:37.334
you filthy old goat.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.510
[indistinct chattering]

26:39.598 --> 26:41.904
[groaning]

26:41.991 --> 26:43.427
How-how dare you?

26:43.514 --> 26:44.820
Oh! Oh!

26:47.388 --> 26:50.130
You brought him
all the way back here why?

26:50.217 --> 26:52.567
The local sheriff begged me
not to put him in his jail.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.003
Kurtik's a big cheese
down there.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.788
That is a signal.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.964
Is that not a signal that
we should cut this man loose?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.183
He hit Jane pretty good.
People were watching.

27:00.270 --> 27:01.620
I had to arrest him.

27:01.707 --> 27:05.928
This guy is connected.
This guy is..

27:06.015 --> 27:07.930
...he has the governor's
home phone number.

27:08.017 --> 27:11.194
And we both know that
Jane was asking for it.

27:11.281 --> 27:15.285
You couldn't just give Kurtik
a stern talking-to instead?

27:15.372 --> 27:17.374
What about
Christine Tanner, sir?

27:17.461 --> 27:18.898
If Kurtik was
having sex with her

27:18.985 --> 27:20.421
that gives him
motive to kill.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.816
If,and that's a hunch
based on "Rockabilly."

27:23.903 --> 27:27.384
It's a Jane hunch. You keep
him around for a reason.

27:27.471 --> 27:30.779
Look, just let us work Kurtik
until his lawyer gets here.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.215
Maybe we can get
something more.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.608
Alright.
Work him gently.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.178
Do you have a thing for
youngsters in general, Dane?

27:38.265 --> 27:41.921
Or was it Christine in
particular that appealed to you?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.923
That I can understand,
because you know

27:44.010 --> 27:46.708
you meet some 15-year-olds,
they're just as smart and mature

27:46.795 --> 27:49.145
and articulate
as any adult, right?

27:50.625 --> 27:51.757
They areadults, basically.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.454
Maybe Christine
was one of them.

27:56.065 --> 27:57.893
Are you serious?

27:57.980 --> 28:01.244
Do you actually obtain
confessions with thatgambit?

28:01.331 --> 28:02.898
All the time.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.815
Amazing. People are stupid.
Listen, I admire cops.

28:06.902 --> 28:09.122
'I think you do a great job,
and I'm happy to sit here'

28:09.209 --> 28:11.080
'and chat with you
until my lawyer gets here.'

28:13.430 --> 28:16.172
But I'm not gonna say
anything you wanna hear.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.217
So relax, huh?

28:17.304 --> 28:20.699
He's not, is he?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.701
He's not gonna confess.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.050
What'd you think,
he'd break under

28:24.137 --> 28:26.139
the bad lighting conditions?

28:26.226 --> 28:28.402
- Let's go back to Devon Point.
- What for?

28:28.489 --> 28:31.144
So I can put the second half
of my cunning plan into effect.

28:32.580 --> 28:35.975
Jane, wait. What cunning plan?

28:36.062 --> 28:39.805
Uh, Danny, hi. Patrick Jane.
Listen, we need your help.

28:39.892 --> 28:41.676
Do you want to help us
catch Christine's killer?

28:43.547 --> 28:45.419
Okay, then. Good.

28:45.506 --> 28:46.986
Meet me at Devon Point
with your friends

28:47.073 --> 28:49.858
in, uh...two hours.

28:50.511 --> 28:51.686
Great.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.427
What cunning plan?

28:57.344 --> 28:59.389
Just so you know,
I'm suing the CBI

28:59.476 --> 29:01.827
'and the attorney general's
office for wrongful arrest'

29:01.914 --> 29:04.177
and unlawful imprisonment,
and I will drop this suit

29:04.264 --> 29:07.528
when they fire you
and Agent Lisbon.

29:07.615 --> 29:08.747
Best of luck.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.053
You're not
scared of me, huh?

29:11.140 --> 29:12.489
That's a mistake.

29:12.576 --> 29:15.188
[chuckles]

29:15.275 --> 29:20.323
Keep walking, Mr. Kurtik, or I'm
gonna have to arrest you again.

29:20.410 --> 29:23.849
If you were 15 years younger,
I might give you a shot.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.078
Mr. Jane?

29:37.906 --> 29:39.168
Mr. Jane?

29:40.691 --> 29:42.824
Thanks for coming.

29:42.911 --> 29:45.044
The police need your help.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.481
First Christine,
then the security guard.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.135
They're at a loss.

29:49.222 --> 29:51.790
Did the guard stumble
across Chris being killed?

29:51.877 --> 29:54.096
Maybe it was some kind
of love triangle.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.187
Tell me, do you
sincerely wanna help

29:58.274 --> 29:59.841
catch Christine's murderer

29:59.928 --> 30:01.887
even if the killer is
someone close to you?

30:01.974 --> 30:03.802
- Yes, of course.
- Absolutely.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.632
Your friend Flipper served time
for assaulting a woman.

30:08.719 --> 30:12.114
- Did you know that?
- It was Flipper? He did it?

30:12.201 --> 30:13.246
Could be.

30:15.552 --> 30:18.555
'Then again, Danny'

30:18.642 --> 30:20.383
Christine and your father
were having an affair.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.429
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

30:22.516 --> 30:25.388
No way. No, no.
That's.. That's ridiculous. No.

30:25.475 --> 30:28.565
Danny, get real.
We knew. We all knew.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.746
Well, what did you expect me
to do, turn in my own dad?

30:39.533 --> 30:43.276
I mean, it's-it's not like he
forced Chris to do it, you know?

30:43.363 --> 30:45.495
She-she was..
She was into it.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.195
Was it your father
you thought

30:49.282 --> 30:50.413
she was going to meet
with that night?

30:50.500 --> 30:51.937
- Yes.
- 'No.'

30:54.548 --> 30:56.028
Well, I-I don't know.

30:58.465 --> 30:59.683
Well, just 'cause
they're having an affair

30:59.770 --> 31:02.861
doesn't mean your father
killed Christine.

31:02.948 --> 31:07.430
- It could have been Flipper.
- Right. Or someone else.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.911
Did-didn't you say you had
a way of finding out?

31:14.568 --> 31:17.266
Actually...a way
youcan find out.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.314
[instrumental music]

31:36.416 --> 31:37.852
I wanna hypnotize you all

31:37.939 --> 31:40.681
so that you can remember
details of that night.

31:40.768 --> 31:43.031
It's safe.
I'm fully trained.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.641
Hell, I used to hypnotize
people for a living.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.426
Um, no-no, thanks.

31:46.513 --> 31:48.123
Your subconscious minds
may recall things

31:48.210 --> 31:49.908
that could help us
find the killer.

31:49.995 --> 31:53.346
Hypnosis will let you
come up with those things.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.348
Well, what-what kind of things?

31:55.435 --> 31:58.481
Who knows?
Maybe something Chris said

31:58.568 --> 32:00.962
maybe a glimpse of someone
on the bluff there.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.138
The smallest detail
that you can recall

32:03.225 --> 32:05.271
could be a vital clue.

32:05.358 --> 32:07.751
I don't want you messing around
inside my head, man. No offense.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.623
Ah, but that's the thing.

32:09.710 --> 32:13.018
With hypnosis, I can't mesmerize
you against your will.

32:13.105 --> 32:16.847
It's not possible. You are
in control the whole time.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.460
What do you say?

32:26.596 --> 32:27.728
Good.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.126
'I want you
to close your eyes..'

32:35.866 --> 32:37.042
...and listen.

32:40.915 --> 32:44.614
Listen only to my voice.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.835
Think. Think back to that night.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.753
'The bonfire..'

32:52.840 --> 32:54.537
'...the sound of the ocean.'

32:56.626 --> 32:58.411
'The sound of the ocean.'

33:00.979 --> 33:03.372
'I don't know what you will
recall of that night'

33:03.459 --> 33:06.158
but I know that you will
recall something

33:06.245 --> 33:09.509
'because it's all there
in your memory.'

33:12.860 --> 33:15.471
'All you have to do
is go back.'

33:16.907 --> 33:19.823
'Back to that night
and be there.'

33:21.956 --> 33:23.827
'And there you are.'

33:23.914 --> 33:25.307
Ah!

33:25.394 --> 33:27.222
What is it, Hope?
What do you see?

33:27.309 --> 33:31.183
I see Danny's father.
There, above the rocks.

33:31.270 --> 33:34.447
- No, you don't.
- Shh, what is he doing?

33:36.188 --> 33:38.538
Staring at us.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.235
At Chris.

33:40.322 --> 33:43.021
That's it.
He's staring.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.326
What's wrong with him?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.678
Come back, Hope.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.552
- Wha-what happened?
- You're okay.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.858
You did very well,
thank you.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.078
You really saw Mr. Kurtik?

33:57.165 --> 33:59.559
No, you didn't.
You didn't.

33:59.646 --> 34:03.041
Danny, I'm sorry.
I can't help what I saw.

34:03.128 --> 34:06.653
- My dad didn't kill Christine!
- How do you know he didn't?

34:06.740 --> 34:07.915
Yeah, how do you know?

34:11.005 --> 34:13.529
You know, screw all
of you guys, okay?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.143
- You guys suck.
- Oh, Danny, wait!

34:18.230 --> 34:20.754
Don't be mad!
Danny, wait!

34:20.841 --> 34:22.886
D-Danny! Come on, stop.

34:22.973 --> 34:25.672
Ah, Danny's mad.

34:25.759 --> 34:28.066
- We should go.
- Screw Danny.

34:29.632 --> 34:30.851
His dad killed Christine.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.683
Yeah.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.294
- It's late anyway.
- Thanks for your help, guys.

34:39.381 --> 34:41.079
No problemo.

34:41.166 --> 34:43.559
[instrumental music]

34:52.916 --> 34:54.962
So what do you think?
Did it work?

34:55.049 --> 34:56.703
I think..

34:56.790 --> 34:58.096
...three

34:58.183 --> 35:00.794
two, one..

35:00.881 --> 35:02.230
...now!

35:05.538 --> 35:08.715
How cool would it have been if
one had walked in right then?

35:08.802 --> 35:10.020
Hi.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.765
Did you arrest him?
Did he confess?

35:15.852 --> 35:17.027
Mr. Kurtik?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.290
No.

35:18.377 --> 35:19.900
Thing is, Hope,
Mr. Kurtik

35:19.987 --> 35:22.294
has a cast-iron alibi
for that evening.

35:22.381 --> 35:26.080
So you couldn't have seen him
standing there on that bluff.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.300
But that's so weird.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.650
In my trance, I saw him
clear as day.

35:32.347 --> 35:35.089
- Maybe it's symbolic.
- You want symbolic?

35:35.176 --> 35:38.701
You're a hawk, and Christine
was a rabbit.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.270
What does that even mean?

35:42.357 --> 35:43.793
Bird of prey, rabbit.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.708
'You tell me.'

35:45.795 --> 35:48.407
'What it means is you never
liked Christine Tanner.'

35:48.494 --> 35:50.017
Not true!

35:50.104 --> 35:54.456
What it means is,
I never really hypnotized you.

35:54.543 --> 35:57.198
You pretended to be in a trance
to give us a fake story

35:57.285 --> 35:59.461
and incriminate
an innocent man.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.463
No! no.

36:03.378 --> 36:04.597
No.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.297
Just tell us what
happened that night.

36:09.384 --> 36:10.994
From the beginning.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.215
Flipper had already left.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.652
Wasted as usual.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.741
[indistinct chattering]

36:29.796 --> 36:34.104
[Hope]
The guard told us to get out,
or he'd call the cops.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.325
Danny told him to step off.
His dad owns the place.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.903
He's dead.

36:52.514 --> 36:55.735
He didn't mean to.
It was an accident.

36:55.822 --> 36:59.391
We couldn't help the guard see.
But Danny, we could.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.349
So we all promised
not to tell.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.178
All of us.

37:05.788 --> 37:09.531
Except Chris.
Not Chris.

37:09.618 --> 37:12.186
[Hope]
You've gotta understand,
everything Danny had worked

37:12.273 --> 37:14.493
for his whole life
was just washing away

37:14.580 --> 37:17.235
because Chris has to do
the right thing.

37:22.979 --> 37:27.462
He just hit her over the head,
and then she was still moving.

37:27.549 --> 37:30.857
So he dragged her
to the trough there and..

37:30.944 --> 37:33.251
...drowned her in it.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.209
Held her under
until she stopped moving.

37:37.037 --> 37:40.170
And you, Win and Andy
didn't say a word.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.520
Two people murdered.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.611
What if I was next?

37:45.698 --> 37:48.353
I've never seen Danny
like that.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.356
He was like a different
person or something.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.792
Okay. You're safe now.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.054
[knock on door]

37:57.057 --> 37:58.232
Excuse us.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.552
Hey.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.816
I-I can't let my dad be punished
for something he didn't do.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.514
- No matter what a tool he is.
- So you're confessing.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.603
- Huh?
- Huh?

38:21.690 --> 38:23.692
We know it was you that killed
Christine and the guard.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.346
W-what?

38:25.433 --> 38:29.176
No, no, no, that's not right.
Who told you that?

38:29.263 --> 38:32.048
It's so completely not true
that it's insane.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.268
H-how can you do this?

38:34.355 --> 38:36.270
I mean, I-I knew you had
a cold streak, but this?

38:36.357 --> 38:39.665
Danny, I'm sorry.
I had to tell the truth.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.101
You're only making it
worse by lying.

38:41.188 --> 38:43.103
You're only
deceiving yourself.

38:48.630 --> 38:50.850
It was her, okay?

38:50.937 --> 38:53.722
It was her
who killed Chris.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.245
'Hope was jealous of her
ever since'

38:55.333 --> 38:56.986
'she started hanging
out with us.'

38:57.073 --> 38:59.598
Used to be Hope
who was all that.

38:59.685 --> 39:01.774
Then Chris came along,
and we only

39:01.861 --> 39:04.472
'hooked up with Hope
when Chris wasn't around.'

39:04.559 --> 39:06.692
That's so distorted
and not true!

39:06.779 --> 39:09.347
No, I am telling
the truth now.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.089
The security guard..

39:15.570 --> 39:17.311
It was an accident.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.574
And then Chris said she was
gonna call the police.

39:19.661 --> 39:23.056
She-she said we couldn't cover it up because it'd be wrong.

39:23.143 --> 39:25.188
Then Hope..

39:25.275 --> 39:28.061
I-I don't even know.
H-Hope just went crazy.

39:30.368 --> 39:32.108
'Hit her.'

39:32.195 --> 39:33.153
She hit her!

39:33.240 --> 39:35.111
'I did it for you, jerk!'

39:35.198 --> 39:37.200
I did it for you.

39:39.202 --> 39:41.335
She was doing
his dad!

39:41.422 --> 39:44.556
She's acting as a judge
over his life

39:44.643 --> 39:46.819
telling him his life is over
and that he's going to jail

39:46.906 --> 39:51.476
because she's-she's gotta show
integrity and morals.

39:52.825 --> 39:56.002
She was a prissy,
hypocritical bitch

39:56.089 --> 39:59.005
'and she was gonna
ruin his life.'

39:59.092 --> 40:01.486
[knock on door]

40:11.321 --> 40:12.322
[Patrick]
'Hmm.'

40:15.456 --> 40:17.763
- It was Flipper.
- Oh, really?

40:17.850 --> 40:19.504
Yeah, it was Flipper.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.724
What if I said it was you, Andy?
You killed Christine.

40:22.811 --> 40:26.467
What? That's bull.
That's ridiculous.

40:30.166 --> 40:31.341
[door opens]

40:33.213 --> 40:34.388
[Patrick]
'Have a seat.'

40:37.696 --> 40:39.001
'Don't be shy.'

40:41.264 --> 40:42.614
I didn't kill her, man.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.312
Sure you did.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.533
So did you.

40:49.882 --> 40:50.926
And you..

40:52.232 --> 40:54.277
...and you.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.628
All four of you killed her.

40:56.715 --> 40:59.065
[Patrick]
Hope was always smarter
than any of you.

41:00.501 --> 41:02.155
You never appreciated that.

41:13.383 --> 41:14.907
She made all of you
take part

41:14.994 --> 41:17.300
to make all of you
equally guilty

41:17.387 --> 41:19.172
so that no one could
tell on the others.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.873
And now you're all
equally under arrest.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.701
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.877
'Anything you say can
and will be used against you'

41:28.964 --> 41:30.226
'in a court of law.'

41:30.313 --> 41:31.489
'You have the right
to an attorney.'

41:31.576 --> 41:33.055
'If you cannot..'

41:37.407 --> 41:41.847
Statutory rape, huh?
What'll he get?

41:41.934 --> 41:43.152
He probably
won't serve time

41:43.239 --> 41:45.894
not without
Christine's testimony.

41:45.981 --> 41:47.766
But we'll have fun trying.

41:52.422 --> 41:53.380
You have good kids.

41:55.904 --> 41:58.994
Yeah.
I do.

41:59.081 --> 42:00.474
You're all they have.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.956
Yeah.
I know.

42:06.480 --> 42:07.786
Be good to them.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.182
I am good to them.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.970
My father was a good man,
just like you are.

42:18.057 --> 42:19.493
And after my mother died

42:19.580 --> 42:23.541
he was a self-pitying
drunk just like you are.

42:23.628 --> 42:26.892
He killed himself. Damn near
killed me and my brothers, too.

42:29.459 --> 42:30.983
Get some help.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.680
Your kids deserve it.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.203
So do you.

42:45.258 --> 42:47.608
[instrumental music]

43:08.237 --> 43:09.238
