(Mindy)
I ACTUALLY DON'T MIND
BEING SINGLE,

00:03.771 --> 00:04.738
BECAUSE I LIVE
IN NEW YORK CITY--

00:04.772 --> 00:05.606
THE GREATEST CITY
IN THE WORLD.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.342
HERE'S WHAT I DO MIND:
WHEN YOUR LYING,

00:08.376 --> 00:10.244
DRUG ADDICT,
TWO-TIMING EX-BOYFRIEND

00:10.278 --> 00:12.546
SENDS YOU A BEAUTIFUL
WEDDING INVITATION.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.216
AND HE'S MARRYING
SOMEONE NAMED CORINNE?

00:15.249 --> 00:18.386
I'M--I'M SORRY
IF I'M BORING YOU.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.413
(Danny)
YEAH?

00:45.446 --> 00:46.680
HEY.
HEY.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.216
TOMORROW NIGHT
WHEN WE GO TO JOSH'S WEDDING,

00:48.249 --> 00:49.383
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE YOUR CAR

00:49.417 --> 00:51.285
OR SOMETHING
A LITTLE LESS BORING?

00:51.319 --> 00:53.287
I'M ASKING, 'CAUSE I FOUND
THIS PRETTY COOL FLYER

00:53.321 --> 00:54.822
IN THE TRASH,
FOR A PLACE IN QUEENS

00:54.855 --> 01:00.428
THAT RENTS OUT "A-1 LUXURIOUS
USA AUTOMOBILES."

01:00.461 --> 01:02.630
YOUR OLD SPORTS LAWYER
BOYFRIEND JOSH?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.365
YEAH, I CAN'T GO.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.433
NO, NO, NO.
YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.101
SO I CAN PUT ON MY MAKEUP
AND DRINK IN THE CAR.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.169
YEAH, MINDY,
I REALLY CAN'T GO.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.437
MY KID BROTHER RICHIE'S
IN TOWN.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.339
HE SAYS HE'S GOT BIG NEWS.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.374
I'M HOPING HE'S MOVING
BACK TO NEW YORK.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.243
YOUR BABY BROTHER RICHIE,
WHO YOU RAISED

01:15.276 --> 01:17.245
WHEN YOUR DEADBEAT DAD
WALKED OUT ON YOU?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.879
AW, TWO LITTLE GUYS...

01:18.912 --> 01:20.148
OKAY.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.215
TAKING ON THE BIG CITY,

01:21.249 --> 01:23.251
SLEEPING IN A SARDINE C--
OKAY.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.418
DO NOT DISTRACT ME.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.154
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD
COME TO THIS WEDDING WITH ME.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.321
JUST GO BY YOURSELF.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.123
GO BY MYSELF
TO AN EX'S WEDDING?

01:29.157 --> 01:31.259
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I'LL LOOK PATHETIC.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.594
I ALWAYS LOVE
GOING TO PLACES ALONE.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.130
THAT WAY, I GET TO WEAR
MY SPRINGSTEEN BANDANA,

01:36.164 --> 01:38.232
LISTEN TO MY TRANSISTOR RADIO.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.168
YOU'RE DESCRIBING
A PATHETIC PERSON.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.402
MAYBE THE UNIVERSE
IS TELLING YOU

01:41.435 --> 01:43.171
NOT TO GO
TO ANOTHER EX'S WEDDING.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.872
THE LAST TIME, YOU GAVE
AN INTOXICATED SPEECH,

01:44.905 --> 01:46.674
AND YOU RODE YOUR BIKE
INTO A POOL.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.176
I GUESS I COULD CALL JOSH
AND TELL HIM

01:48.209 --> 01:49.377
I'M BUSY WITH WORK.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.180
OR I COULD
FAKE MY OWN DEATH.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.314
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.283
I'M NOT GONNA GO
DOWN THAT PATH.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.753
[inhales]

01:59.787 --> 02:02.223
OKAY.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.691
[phone line ringing]

02:03.724 --> 02:06.327
[phone ringing]

02:06.360 --> 02:08.429
MINDY, HEY.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.364
HEY, JOSH, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY THAT

02:10.398 --> 02:11.699
I CAN'T COME TO YOUR WEDDING

02:11.732 --> 02:14.368
BECAUSE OF A WORK EMERGENCY
WITH A VIP PATIENT.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.469
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
WHO IT IS,

02:15.503 --> 02:17.305
BUT JAY-Z WOULD BE FURIOUS.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.373
SORRY. IT'S BEYONCE.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.342
COOL, I GET IT.
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

02:21.375 --> 02:23.344
YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL
INTIMIDATED OR ANYTHING.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.279
OH.
I DON'T FEEL INTIMIDATED.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.248
LIKE I SAID,
IT'S BECAUSE OF A WORK THING.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.350
AH, BEING
A PROFESSIONAL WOMAN--

02:29.383 --> 02:31.219
BALANCING WORK
AND PERSONAL LIFE,

02:31.252 --> 02:32.453
AH, IT'S SO HARD.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.355
IT'S TOUGH TO GO
TO AN EX'S WEDDING,

02:34.388 --> 02:36.290
AND I GOT ENGAGED
SO QUICKLY.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.958
BUT YOU'LL
FIND SOMEONE EVENTUALLY.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.361
YOU'RE GREAT.
I KNOW THAT I'M GREAT.

02:40.394 --> 02:43.397
OH, LOOK, I JUST GOT AN EMAIL
FROM BEYONCE.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.633
TURNS OUT,
CRANBERRY JUICE DID THE TRICK,

02:45.666 --> 02:47.335
SO I CAN COME
TO YOUR WEDDING.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.402
OKAY, GOOD.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.405
AND I'M BRINGING A DATE.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.611
WHO TO ASK?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.248
MMM. MMM.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.949
UGH.

OOH. BURN ON YOU, DR. C.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.616

04:08.649 --> 04:09.883
YEAH, YEAH, HE HAD
TO TEAR HIMSELF AWAY

04:09.917 --> 04:13.387
FROM ALL THOSE HOT BODIES
DOWN AT SOUTH BEACH, RIGHT?
OKAY.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.422
I KNOW FLORIDA
FROM THE MOVIES.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.024
ARE YOU A COCAINE SALESMAN
OR A PET DETECTIVE?

04:17.057 --> 04:19.293
OH, NO, I'M A TENNIS PRO

04:19.327 --> 04:23.030
ANYWAY, I'M HAVING A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT AT MY PLACE.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.732
YOU CAN'T HAVE A PARTY TOMORROW
NIGHT, 'CAUSE I CAN'T MAKE IT.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.567
[inhales]
I HAVE TO GO
TO JOSH'S WEDDING.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.935
THAT'S PERFECT TIMING.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.003
OKAY, LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S GOT THE CASTELLANO CURSE.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.039
HE'S GOT A PERFECT FACE.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.711
HEY, GUYS, DANNY'S BROTHER

I LET ALL THE GUYS
IN MY COLLEGE MADRIGAL GROUP

04:44.051 --> 04:45.886
TOUCH MY BOOB,
JUST SO THEY COULD FEEL ONE.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.088

SAYS, "FUN BRAID"?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.657
MM.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.426
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHY RICHIE'S IN TOWN?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.927
HE'S GONNA COME
OUT OF THE CLOSET TO DANNY,

04:53.961 --> 04:54.995
AND DANNY'S SO CATHOLIC.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.698
I MEAN, HE SAYS A PRAYER
BEFORE HE HAS CHEWING GUM.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.433
AND HE DOES NOT
LIKE SURPRISES.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.569
THAT'S WHY HE HATES
BOXES OF CHOCOLATE,

05:01.602 --> 05:03.537
BECAUSE HE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT HE'S GONNA GET.

05:03.571 --> 05:07.441
OKAY, LOOK.
I KNOW THAT 99.9%

05:07.475 --> 05:08.709
OF THE PEOPLE
WHO CALL FOR AN ESCORT

05:08.742 --> 05:10.344
REALLY JUST
WANT A PROSTITUTE.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.445
AND OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO INSIST THAT

05:11.479 --> 05:12.480
THEY JUST WANT AN ESCORT,

05:12.513 --> 05:13.881
I KNOW THAT
THEY KINDA WANT SEX.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.617
BUT I AM JUST A NICE WOMAN
WHO IS LOOKING

05:16.650 --> 05:19.387
FOR AN ESCORT TO ESCORT HER
TO A WEDDING, OKAY?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.054
AND YES, IF HE'S GOOD-LOOKING,
I WOULD CONSIDER--

05:21.088 --> 05:22.523
[knock at door]
HEY, MIN.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.024
WORD ON THE STREET
IS YOU'RE LOOKING

05:24.057 --> 05:26.126
FOR A PLUS-ONE TO GO
TO A WEDDING WITH YOU.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.396
NO, THAT--
YOU ARE MISINFORMED.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.430
I JUST HEARD YOU
ON THE PHONE

05:29.463 --> 05:30.364
TALKING TO A PROSTITUTE.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.600
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I BALKED AT THE PRICE.

05:32.633 --> 05:33.734
YOU NEED TO LET ME COME.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.469
YOU NEED A PLUS-ONE.
I KILL AT WEDDINGS.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.737
THEY CALL ME "MR. WEDDING."

05:36.770 --> 05:38.606
THAT MEANS YOU SCAM
ON ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.040
YOU MAKE EVERYONE
CLEAR THE DANCE FLOOR,

05:40.073 --> 05:41.609
SO YOU CAN BREAK-DANCE BADLY.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.010
AND THEN SOMEHOW,
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

05:43.043 --> 05:44.011
YOU'RE UP THERE
WITH THE BAND,

05:44.044 --> 05:44.945
AND YOU'RE AIR SAXOPHONING.

05:44.978 --> 05:48.582
MINDY, I CAN'T SPEND
ANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT

05:48.616 --> 05:50.418
STALKING EX-GIRLFRIENDS
ON THE INTERNET,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.420
HOPING TO FIND
A BREAST-FEEDING PIC.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.122
GOD.
I NEED TO MEET SOMEONE.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.391
IN AN EFFORT TO GET YOU
TO STOP TELLING ME

05:57.425 --> 06:00.060
THESE SAD TALES,
YOU CAN COME.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.596
[snaps fingers]
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.765
AND I WON'T REGRET THIS.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.067
BECAUSE I PROBABLY
WON'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.136
OKAY.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.874
JOSH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU THOUGHT

06:13.907 --> 06:16.444
I WAS KERRY WASHINGTON
FOR A SECOND.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.878
THAT'S SO RANDOM.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.346
[knock at door]

06:19.379 --> 06:20.914
(Peter)
LET'S GO. I DON'T WANNA
MISS THE COCKTAIL HOUR.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.750
THE DOOR IS OPEN, PETER.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.118
MY GOD, IF YOU ARE
WEARING CARGO SHORTS

06:25.152 --> 06:28.155
OR YOUR "LEGALIZE WEED"
T-SHIRT--

06:30.691 --> 06:32.993
WHOA.
HEY.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.196
MR. WEDDING.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.899
NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.537
(Danny)
GOD, I FEEL LIKE HE COULD
BE IN A BOY BAND.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.806
LOOK AT RICHIE.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.610
HE REMINDS OF A--
LIKE A YOUNG YOU.
MM-HMM.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.545
I BET YOU I HAVE TO SLEEP
ON THE COUCH TONIGHT,

06:51.579 --> 06:53.481
WITH THE WHITE NOISE MACHINE ON.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.948
BUT YOU WOULDN'T
BE DISAPPOINTED

06:54.982 --> 06:57.618
IF HE DIDN'T HOOK UP
WITH A GIRL, RIGHT?

06:57.651 --> 07:02.590
OR, LIKE, IF HE HOOKED UP
WITH, LIKE, A NON-GIRL?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.558
IT BETTER BE A NON-GIRL,
HE'S GAY.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.660
[spits]
YOU OKAY?

07:06.694 --> 07:07.761
YOU KNOW RICHIE'S GAY?

07:07.795 --> 07:11.231
NO, MORGAN, A STRAIGHT GUY
WON MR. GAY FORT LAUDERDALE.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.967
YES, I KNOW HE'S GAY,
OF COURSE.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.669
HOW DID YOU KNOW THIS?

07:15.703 --> 07:17.104
YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO BE A COLUMBO.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.573
THE FOURTH GRADE,
HE GOES TO HALLOWEEN

07:19.607 --> 07:22.576
DRESSED AS SHARON STONE
FROM BASIC INSTINCT.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.045
WHOA.
HE'S GAY.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.614
SO AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

07:26.647 --> 07:29.583
CORINNE AND I MET
IN A CARPENTRY CLASS IN REHAB.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.585
I HATED CARPENTRY.
IT SUCKS.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.821
WHAT AM I, A CAVEMAN?
USE METAL.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.989
BUT BEING AN ADDICT,

07:36.023 --> 07:37.625
I QUICKLY
BECAME OBSESSED WITH IT.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.260
AND I MADE US THESE.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.829
[applause]

07:41.862 --> 07:43.997
WOW.
LOOK AT THE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.633
THEY'RE AMAZING.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.734
NOW, MAYBE I'M
GETTING SENTIMENTAL

07:46.767 --> 07:48.101
FROM THE SPARKLING
APPLE JUICE,

07:48.135 --> 07:51.505
BUT I'D LIKE TO THINK
THESE WILL LAST FOREVER--

07:51.539 --> 07:52.906
LIKE US.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.176
[applause]

07:56.209 --> 07:57.678
GREAT.
TO A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.513
YOU'LL MAKE BEAUTIFUL BABIES.

07:59.547 --> 08:01.749
A YEAR AGO, THAT GUY WAS
LITERALLY IN A GUTTER,

08:01.782 --> 08:02.750
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.819
AND NOW HE IS HAVING
MY DREAM ADORABLE WEDDING.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.655
ALL RIGHT, THE MASON JARS,
THE CUPCAKES

08:07.688 --> 08:09.657
CUTELY ARRANGED IN TIERS
INSTEAD OF A WEDDING CAKE.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.726
THAT WAS MY IDEA,
THAT I HAD IN A DREAM.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.728
I WISH I HAD WRITTEN IT DOWN.
NOW I COULD SUE THEM.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.597
WOW.
THAT WAS VERY MOVING.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.633
OH, COOL, SHAWNE "MERRYMAN" HAS
SOME KIND OF THING TO SAY NOW.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.400
IT'S SHAWNE MERRIMAN.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.869
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LIGHTS OUT.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.137
THAT'S MY CATCHPHRASE--
LIGHTS OUT.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.540
I FEEL YOU. TABLE NINE
HOLDS YOU DOWN, SHAWNE.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.941
SHH. YOU'RE REACTING
TOO LOUDLY.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.110
[Shania Twain's
You're Still the One]

08:30.143 --> 08:32.245
* LOOKS LIKE WE MADE IT

08:32.279 --> 08:34.047
[laughter]

08:34.081 --> 08:36.283
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS COUPLE.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.718
HAVE YOU EVER?

08:37.751 --> 08:39.319
CAN YOU IMAGINE
BEING IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.689
I DATED HIM.
I-I COULD IMAGINE IT.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.990
HOLD ON.
YOU DATED THAT GUY?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.658
THAT'S WHY WE GOT INVITED
TO THIS, IS I DATED HIM.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.727
YOU DATED BOURNE ULTIMATUM
OR WHATEVER?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.095
OKAY, HE'S NOT
THAT GOOD-LOOKING.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.698
* THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT

08:50.731 --> 08:52.566
THAT'S A NICE ONE.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.735
BUT ANYONE CAN BE
PROFESSIONALLY STYLED

08:54.768 --> 08:56.036
TO LOOK CUTE IN A PHOTO.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.039
I'VE DONE IT, LIKE,
TEN TIMES AT THE MALL.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.610
I THINK
THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.277
*

09:04.311 --> 09:05.278
* STILL THE ONE

09:05.312 --> 09:07.247
MINDY, I COULD SIT HERE
ALL NIGHT

09:07.280 --> 09:09.082
POUTING ABOUT MY EX.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.118
BUT I'M GONNA CHOOSE
TO GO PARTY MY NARDS OFF,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.720
AND I WOULD HOPE
THAT YOU WOULD COME WITH ME

09:12.753 --> 09:14.121
AND PARTY YOUR OVES OFF
AS WELL.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.157
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT,
PETER.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.358
LET'S DO IT.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.093
MR. AND MRS. WEDDING,
TO THE DANCE FLOOR.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.662
WHAT?
MORE WINE.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.796
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.632
NO ONE'S DANCING YET.
WE'RE GONNA LOOK REALLY LAME.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.498
IT'S A WEDDING,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LAME.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.601
PETER, NO, PETER!
HEY, YO, DJ TANNER.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.637
THIS DANCE FLOOR
NEEDS TO BE A FULL HOUSE.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.171
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.205
I'M SO SORRY.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.007

(Lionel Richie)
* WELL, MY FRIENDS,

09:41.381 --> 09:42.850
STOP IT.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.940
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD, PETER.

* ALL NIGHT LONG

10:10.010 --> 10:12.012
OH, MY GOD.

ALL RIGHT.
OKAY,
I DON'T THINK SO, PAL.

10:44.778 --> 10:49.316
UH, THAT'S MR. WEDDING,

DANNY, STOP TRYING TO
SET ME UP WITH ANDERSON COOPER.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.860
ARE YOU BACK WITH RAMON?

10:59.893 --> 11:02.730
BIG LATS LIKE THAT,
HOW DOES THAT GUY BUY SUITS?

11:02.763 --> 11:03.563
RAMON WAS WAY TOO
INTO HIS BODY, YOU KNOW?

11:03.596 --> 11:06.700
I WAS BASICALLY A GYM WIDOW.
UH-HUH.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.402
LOOK.
I-I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.071
WHAT?
YEAH.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.106
WAIT HERE.
YOU GOT ME SOMETHING?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.776
(Danny)
LOOK AT THIS KID--
GOOD POSTURE, GOOD MANNERS.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.177
THE ONLY GIFT
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME

11:17.210 --> 11:19.346
IS A VISIT
FROM YOUR GAY ASS.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.413
YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO BRING ME ANYTHING.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.849
WHAT'D YOU GET ME?

11:21.882 --> 11:24.985
DID YOU WRAP THIS YOURSELF?

11:26.319 --> 11:28.421
THE MIAMI VICE SOUNDTRACK?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

11:28.455 --> 11:29.923
LOOK. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

11:29.957 --> 11:30.858
MORGAN, MIAMI VICE.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.826
I THINK I MIGHT BE
TOO YOUNG FOR THAT SHOW.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.361
THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW
GROWING UP.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.163
WHAT ARE YOU--
I LOVE THIS.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.099
FLAMINGOS, BIKINIS,
EDWARD OLMOS.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.334
LOOK AT THIS.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.803
THIS WAS
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.038
YOU KNOW,
THE GIFT ISN'T FROM ME.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.740
IT'S FROM DAD.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.042
HE SAID YOU GUYS
USED TO WATCH IT TOGETHER, SO--

11:49.076 --> 11:52.079
IT'S FROM DAD?

11:55.883 --> 11:56.884
[gasps]

11:56.917 --> 11:57.885
WHAT THE HELL?
GET IN THERE.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.219
DAN, COME ON, DAN.
GET IN THERE.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.521
(Morgan)
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.856
(Danny)
NO, NO, NO, NO.
GET IN HERE.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.091
YOU DIDN'T COME
TO VISIT ME?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.159
YOU CAME ON A MISSION
FOR THAT LOSER?

12:06.193 --> 12:07.494
WHAT DOES HE WANT?
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

12:07.527 --> 12:09.396
HE WANTS MONEY?
DOES HE WANT MY BONE MARROW?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.431
DON'T LET HIM
NEAR YOUR MARROW.
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.333
HE JUST WANTS
TO GET TO KNOW ME.
OH, COME ON.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.535
YOU'RE SO GULLIBLE.
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO GULLIBLE.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.871
YOUR PET TURTLE?
SHELLEY LONG?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.440
YEAH, SEVEN TURTLES.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.909
LOOK, I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE

12:21.942 --> 12:24.344
TO DESTROY MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DAD.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.981
AND THE PIZZA OVEN
ISN'T EVEN HOT ENOUGH.

12:28.015 --> 12:31.018
WHAT'D YOU SAY?
WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.854
(Danny)
DON'T YOU DARE
DISRESPECT MY PIZZA OVEN.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.258
MINDY, HEY.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.893
HEY, JOSH.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.495
I HAVE TO SAY,
THIS IS A PERFECT WEDDING.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.932
GOOD, THANK YOU.
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.066
THAT DRESS MAKES YOU
LOOK MORE PROPORTIONAL

12:46.099 --> 12:47.400
THAN YOU ACTUALLY ARE.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.002
YOU'RE THE LIFE
OF THE PARTY.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.370
AND THAT GUY YOU BROUGHT,
WHO IS THAT?

12:50.403 --> 12:52.239
HE'S THE BEST.
[chuckles]
PETER.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.107
YEAH, PETER'S ALL RIGHT.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.476
YOU TWO MAKE
A CUTE COUPLE, HUH?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.879
YOU GO GREAT TOGETHER.
OH, THANK YOU.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.480
I GUESS WE DO.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
[giggles]
OH, BABY.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.822
[gasps]

13:08.856 --> 13:10.123
REALLY?
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.458
PETER, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

13:11.491 --> 13:13.293
SHE THREW HERSELF AT ME.
I CAN'T SAY NO.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.527
YOU KNOW, IT'S HER DAY.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.296
I WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S JUST
AS SHE DREAMED AS A LITTLE GIRL.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.831
(Mindy)
OH, MY GOD.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.399
JOSH, STOP, STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP!

13:19.432 --> 13:20.834
IT'S YOU'RE DAY TOO,
AND I'M SORRY.
SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
JOSH, CALM DOWN, OKAY?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.236
LET'S JUST GET YOU A DRINK.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.038
I CAN'T HAVE A DRINK, MINDY!
GOD, THAT'S RIGHT.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.239
WHAT, NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO KNOCK ME OFF THE WAGON,

13:26.273 --> 13:29.476
IN ADDITION TO BRING THIS--
THIS GREASY CREEP...
GREASY?

13:29.509 --> 13:30.643
TO HAVE SEX WITH MY WIFE?

13:30.677 --> 13:33.580
WHO, BY THE WAY, JUST GOT
OUT OF REHAB FOR SEX ADDICTION.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.416
(both)
OHH. THAT MAKES--

13:36.449 --> 13:37.550
NO, NO, NO, NO!

13:37.584 --> 13:38.385
BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT,

13:38.418 --> 13:40.220
AND SHE CLEARLY
HAD DONE IT BEFORE.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.621
WHY ARE YOU NOT MORE MAD?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.056
YOUR BOYFRIEND JUST
CHEATED ON YOU

13:43.090 --> 13:45.125
ON A DIAPER CHANGE STATION.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.060
WE HAVE AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.
HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.429
HE'S JUST SOME LOSER
FROM WORK THAT I BROUGHT.
HEY.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.998
THIS IS PATHETIC.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.365
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.334
[door opens]

13:54.367 --> 13:55.869
I THINK
I'M IN LOVE WITH HER.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.370
WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

13:57.404 --> 14:00.473
RICHIE, WAIT.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.642
HEY, RICHIE CASTELLANO--
[coughs]

14:02.675 --> 14:05.578
RICHIE, WAIT, WAIT.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.980
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.549
MY HEART.
[coughs]

14:09.582 --> 14:11.384
UH, LISTEN.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.419
YOU GOTTA FORGIVE DANNY--

14:12.452 --> 14:13.887
HE'S SUCH A DICK
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW?

14:13.921 --> 14:16.456
YEAH, HE'S OBVIOUSLY
A DICK, RICHIE.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.290
BUT DANNY'S CHANGED.
WHAT'D HE DO?

14:17.324 --> 14:18.591
HE WATCH A WNBA GAME?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.228
NO, HE'S NOT A LESBIAN.
NO OFFENSE.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.197
DANNY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT
YOUR TRIP NONSTOP FOR WEEKS.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.398
REALLY?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.367
YEAH, YOU CAN'T
SHUT HIM UP ABOUT IT.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.236
IT'S BIZARRE.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.570
AND I ALWAYS THOUGHT BROTHERS

14:30.603 --> 14:32.372
WERE JUST FOR TAKING
YOUR CHRISTMAS NUTS

14:32.405 --> 14:34.074
AND HOLDING YOUR HEAD
DOWN THE LOO.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.043
MAYBE I SHOULD
GO TALK TO HIM.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.277
THANKS.
YEAH.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.412
OH, NO, WE'RE NOT JOGGING,
ARE WE?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.350
HELLO?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.418
[knock at door]

14:47.287 --> 14:48.989
(Mindy)
OH, MY GOD, JOSH, NO, NO!

14:49.022 --> 14:52.059
DON'T DO DRUGS, SAY NO!
USERS ARE LOSERS!

14:52.092 --> 14:54.227
WHOA.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.696
COCAINE IS DELICIOUS.
IT'S POWDERED SUGAR.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.131
I'M STILL SOBER.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.300
I JUST FIND
THE RITUALS COMFORTING.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.301
GOOD. AND GOOD FOR ME.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.169
'CAUSE I'D BE A DRUG ADDICT

15:02.202 --> 15:04.537
IF COCAINE WAS
AS DELICIOUS AS SUGAR.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.073
CAN I--
IS THERE ANY LEFT?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.107
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.376
HEY. I'M SO SORRY.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.978
I ONLY BROUGHT PETER
TO THIS WEDDING

15:11.011 --> 15:13.346
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT I NEEDED A DATE,

15:13.380 --> 15:15.382
SO YOU WOULD THINK
THAT MY LIFE WAS TOGETHER.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.516
I GET IT.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.252
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU THINK
I THREW THIS SIX-FIGURE WEDDING?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.453
IT SURE WASN'T FOR THE FUN
OF BARGAINING WITH

15:20.487 --> 15:22.355
"ROSCOE AND THE MOTOWN MOMENT."

15:22.389 --> 15:24.091
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:24.124 --> 15:26.426
I MET A GIRL IN REHAB,

15:26.459 --> 15:28.361
WHO WAS CHEATING
ON HER BOYFRIEND WITH ME.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.197
AND THEN
AFTER WE GOT ENGAGED,

15:30.230 --> 15:31.698
SHE CHEATED ON ME
WITH THE EX-BOYFRIEND.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.101
YIKES.
BUT I IGNORED
ALL THE WARNING SIGNS,

15:34.134 --> 15:35.402
BECAUSE I WAS
IN SUCH A RUSH TO PROVE

15:35.435 --> 15:38.405
I WASN'T A DRUGGED-OUT FAILURE
ANYMORE.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.207
[sighs]

15:40.240 --> 15:44.311
NO, JOSH, NO!
CALMING MECHANISM, RELAX.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.447
CORINNE RAN OUT.
PEOPLE ARE ASKING QUESTIONS.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.415
I JUST REALLY WISH
I DIDN'T HAVE

15:48.448 --> 15:51.684
TO GO OUT THERE
AND EXPLAIN IT TO EVERYONE.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.386
I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME,
YOU KNOW?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.988
DANNY WAS RIGHT.
EVERY TIME I GO

15:55.022 --> 15:59.192
TO AN EX'S WEDDING,
I JUST RUIN IT.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.361
JOSH,
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.163
YOUR FAKE DRUG THING
HELPED ME.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.132
WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:05.165 --> 16:08.235
I'M GONNA DO WHAT I DO BEST
AT WEDDINGS--

16:08.268 --> 16:10.503
RUIN THEM.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.505
WE'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE

16:12.539 --> 16:14.241
TRACKING DOWN
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.542
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'LL ENTERTAIN YOU

16:15.575 --> 16:18.578
A LITTLE BIT
WITH SOME JUGGLING.

16:18.611 --> 16:22.382
(Shawne)
I CAN DO IT BETTER WHEN--
WHEN I'M BY MYSELF.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.017
[clears throat]
EXCUSE ME, SHAWNE MERRIMAN.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.352
I'D LIKE TO USE THE MICROPHONE.
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.220
BUT I CAN DO IT, THOUGH.
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE, I--

16:27.254 --> 16:28.488
I'M SURE YOU CAN.
YOU'RE VERY GOOD-LOOKING.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.323
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, HI.

16:30.357 --> 16:33.060
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME
FROM EARLIER IN THE EVENING,

16:33.093 --> 16:34.694
'CAUSE I WAS KILLING IT
ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.363
YEAH, YOU'RE THE GIRL
THAT STOLE ALL THE MEATBALLS.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.530
OKAY, THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE.

16:37.564 --> 16:38.698
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.400
THE WEDDING
HAS BEEN CALLED OFF.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.668
YEAH, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

16:41.701 --> 16:45.772
I TRIED TO HAVE SEX WITH JOSH
IN THE BATHROOM.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.508
AND THEN CORINNE WALKED IN.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.410
BUT IT IS NOT
JOSH'S FAULT AT ALL.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.279
NO, MINDY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

16:52.312 --> 16:53.746
NO, JOSH,
THEY DESERVE TO KNOW,

16:53.780 --> 16:55.415
BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.517
I'M OBSESSED WITH YOU.
AND I COULDN'T NOT HAVE YOU--

16:57.550 --> 16:58.785
(Peter)
STOP, STOP!

16:58.818 --> 17:00.420
PETER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.554
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS ALONE.

17:01.588 --> 17:02.689
IT'S TRUE.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.325
I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.727
AND IT WAS DISGUSTING.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.796
HEY, HOW MANY PEOPLE HERE
ARE FED UP

17:09.829 --> 17:10.730
WITH AIRLINE FOOD, HUH?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.300
SHOW OF HANDS--
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH--

17:13.333 --> 17:14.501
[stammering]

17:14.534 --> 17:16.503
GUYS ALWAYS WANNA
WATCH SPORTS, RIGHT?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.505
AND WOMEN JUST--
PETER, PETER--
PETER, NO.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.340
THANKS,
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.310
SO ALL THIS TO SAY,
JOSH IS NOT TO BLAME.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.412
WE DON'T BLAME HIM.
WE BLAME YOU, MEATBALL.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.280
THAT'S ENOUGH, C.J. WILSON.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.415
JUST BECAUSE I LIKE
TO EAT MEATBALLS

17:28.448 --> 17:29.716
DOES NOT MEAN
I'M MADE OF MEATBALLS.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.551
WELL, I THINK THE REASON
I DID IT IS

17:31.584 --> 17:35.288
BECAUSE I'M JEALOUS OF JOSH
BECAUSE HIS LIFE IS GREAT.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.624
AND I'M STILL
KIND OF A DISASTER.
TRAIN WRECK.

17:37.657 --> 17:41.428
ANYWAY,
SO PLEASE FORGIVE US.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.730
YOU RUINED TRUE LOVE,
YOU MONSTER.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.398
OH, MY GOD.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.768
HOW DARE YOU, C.J. WILSON?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.470
IS THAT THE BEST YOU GOT,
C.J.?

17:50.503 --> 17:52.372
OH, GOD, HE'S GOT A CANNON!

17:55.408 --> 17:57.544
(Morgan)
HEY, GUYS, PLAYING LIMBO
WAS KIND OF MY IDEA,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.380
SO I'D LIKE A TURN.
HELLO.

18:00.413 --> 18:04.517
STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.
HEY.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.854
[sighs]

18:07.887 --> 18:09.356
LOOK, RICHIE,
WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO DAD?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.358
COME ON, HE'S A LOSER.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.492
I BELIEVE YOU.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.594
EVERY TIME I SAY THE WORD "DAD,"
YOU CLENCH YOUR FIST.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.596
I DO NOT.
DAD.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.366
OH, GOD.
WHY AREN'T YOU MAD?

18:19.399 --> 18:21.201
I MEAN, HE LEFT US.
HE LEFT MOM.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.270
IT'S HIS FAULT
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A DAD.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.207
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE I DID HAVE A DAD.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.441
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:28.475 --> 18:30.443
YOU RAISED ME, DANNY.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.279
YOU TAUGHT ME HOW TO SHAVE.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.513
YOU TAUGHT ME
HOW TO SHAVE MY LEGS

18:33.546 --> 18:34.914
WHEN I DID CABARET.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.250
I LOVE YOU, RICHIE.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.921
LOOK, DANNY,
DAD'S IN CALIFORNIA.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.556
HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.159
YEAH, I WANNA TALK
TO 1982 PAT BENATAR,

18:46.193 --> 18:48.328
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT GONNA--

18:48.361 --> 18:50.263
I DON'T CARE
THAT DAD SENT YOU.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.398
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.567
AND MAYBE I CAN GET YOU
TO MOVE BACK.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.269
COME ON, YOU KNOW
I GOTTA LIVE IN FLORIDA.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.238
WHY?
I LOOK TOO GOOD IN LINEN.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.739
OH, COME ON, YOU LOOK GREAT
IN A GARBAGE BAG.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.308
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
STOP IT.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.742
GET OVER HERE.
GIVE ME A HUG.

WHY I CALL YOU ALL THE TIME *

19:10.383 --> 19:12.285

19:12.319 --> 19:15.255
I GET IT, YOU KNOW, I SUCK.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.224
IT'S JUST,
BEING AT A WEDDING TONIGHT

19:17.257 --> 19:19.326
REMINDED ME THAT
BECCA'S GETTING ENGAGED AND--

19:19.359 --> 19:20.560
NO, NO, STOP.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.663
YOU CANNOT BLAME YOUR EX
FOR TONIGHT.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.498
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.866
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU JUST--

19:26.899 --> 19:29.236
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT BECCA TOOK MY HEART AND--

19:29.269 --> 19:30.437
STOP IT, STOP IT, OKAY?

19:30.470 --> 19:32.272
YOU CANNOT BLAME BECCA

19:32.305 --> 19:33.773
FOR ALL
OF YOUR STUPID, BAD BEHAVIOR.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.776
BECCA IS NOT SOME EVIL WIZARD
THAT CONTROLS YOUR PENIS.

19:36.809 --> 19:39.246
CAN I GET "VULNIES" WITH YOU
FOR A SECOND?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.248
EH.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.383
WHEN THE BRIDE CAME AT ME,

19:43.416 --> 19:47.254
I KINDA JUST
WENT WITH IT BECAUSE...

19:47.287 --> 19:49.756
I HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN OVER A YEAR AND A HALF.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.724
WHAT?
ARE YOU S--

19:51.758 --> 19:53.526
YOU ARE CONSTANTLY
TELLING SEX STORIES.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.363
I KNOW--
ALL FROM THE CASE FILES.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.630
THE TRUTH IS THAT
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE

19:57.664 --> 19:59.699
HAVING FUN TONIGHT,
THAT WAS THE LONGEST

19:59.732 --> 20:01.834
I'VE GONE WITHOUT THINKING
ABOUT BECCA IN--

20:01.868 --> 20:03.803
GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW LONG.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.239
IT WAS PRETTY FUN.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.607
MR. AND MS. WEDDING.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.376
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE,

20:09.409 --> 20:11.344
FOR A MICROSECOND,
I LOOKED AT YOU,

20:11.378 --> 20:14.314
AND I THOUGHT, "HMM, YEAH,

20:14.347 --> 20:19.252
I COULD SEE HOW SOMEONE
COULD DATE THAT GUY."

20:19.286 --> 20:21.654
YOU LOVE ME.
WHAT?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.390
YOU LO ME.
NO, I DON'T.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.560
YOU WANNA MAKE ADORABLE,
MIXED-RACE BABIES WITH ME.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.661
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.298
I WANNA MAKE MIXED-RACE BABIES
WITH MICHAEL FASSBENDER.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.399
YOU WANT ME
TO PULL THE CAR OVER,

20:32.432 --> 20:34.267
SO WE CAN GET IT ON,
OR YOU JUST WANNA GO TO TOWN?

20:34.301 --> 20:36.603
OH, MY GOD.
I GENTLY COMPLIMENTED YOU.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.037
LOOK AT US.
WE'RE HAVING OUR FIRST FIGHT.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.307
I'M GONNA THROW UP.
NO MORE TALKING.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.842

20:55.922 --> 20:56.889
HOW WAS THE WEDDING?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.458
EH, I GOT LAID.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.726
I RUINED IT.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.394
