01:44.968 --> 01:47.601
Uh-huh, Barbie.

02:20.501 --> 02:22.367
Hey.

02:24.067 --> 02:25.534
Hey.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.667
So how were you planning
on getting home

02:27.701 --> 02:29.234
if I hadn't shown up?

02:29.267 --> 02:31.200
How do you get
anywhere from here?

02:31.234 --> 02:32.367
Middle of nowhere.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.667
Yeah, that's where
they build them.

02:35.701 --> 02:37.601
They give you
a bus schedule.

02:42.868 --> 02:45.000
Thanks for coming.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.167
No problem.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.667
<i>You okay?</i>

04:40.701 --> 04:43.200
It doesn't feel
like you think it would.

04:43.234 --> 04:45.234
<i>Getting out?</i>

04:46.467 --> 04:47.934
Yeah.

04:47.968 --> 04:50.234
<i>But you would know.</i>

04:50.267 --> 04:53.467
<i>Yeah, reentry's a bitch</i>

04:53.501 --> 04:56.434
<i>under any circumstances.</i>

04:56.467 --> 04:59.334
<i>You must be missing</i>
<i>your kids.</i>

04:59.367 --> 05:01.834
<i>Sometimes in bed</i>
<i>I'd pretend</i>

05:01.868 --> 05:03.934
<i>that they'd crawled</i>
<i>into my arms like</i>
<i>they used to</i>

05:03.968 --> 05:07.501
<i>when they were little</i>
<i>and they couldn't sleep.</i>

05:07.534 --> 05:09.601
Deva's going
through some stuff.

05:09.634 --> 05:12.234
She needs her mom.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.667
And how's Max?

05:13.701 --> 05:17.534
From what I can see,
he's all about
his skateboard.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.968
<i>You'll see for yourself</i>
<i>soon enough.</i>

05:21.000 --> 05:23.467
<i>Can we stop</i>
<i>somewhere to eat?</i>

05:23.501 --> 05:25.501
<i>I'm starving.</i>

05:44.634 --> 05:46.234
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.868
How much do you remember
about prison food?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.734
You know, there was
this one time

05:56.767 --> 05:58.834
it was the warden's
birthday,

05:58.868 --> 06:00.767
anniversary, something,
I don't know.

06:00.801 --> 06:03.501
He decided he wanted to give
us a special meal, right?

06:03.534 --> 06:07.567
So he has the cooks
make us these big steaks.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.234
Pretty good.

06:09.267 --> 06:13.067
- With potatoes
and pie for dessert.
- Mm.

06:13.100 --> 06:16.801
<i>It's funny-- some guys,</i>
<i>they just inhaled it.</i>

06:16.834 --> 06:20.300
I mean, it had been
so long since...

06:21.801 --> 06:24.200
Other guys,
they took it back
to their tables and sat,

06:24.234 --> 06:27.267
looked at it,
just started crying.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.367
I get it.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.868
<i>Then there was</i>
<i>these other guys</i>

06:31.901 --> 06:34.400
who took the steak
and threw it against
the fucking wall.

06:34.434 --> 06:36.901
Like telling the place
to go fuck itself, you know?

06:36.934 --> 06:39.234
<i>Sean, get back here.</i>

06:39.267 --> 06:41.033
- I got it!
- Girl: <i>Give it back!</i>

06:55.601 --> 06:58.801
- That's so not fair.
- You're supposed to be setting an example.

06:58.834 --> 07:00.334
I told you
this was a bad idea.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.434
I got to tell you,
I'm with Sean on this one.

07:02.467 --> 07:05.200
- He wasn't sharing.
- Sure, take the girl's side.

07:05.234 --> 07:07.200
Yeah, that's what
I'm doing.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.100
This could be Banshee.

07:13.133 --> 07:16.167
Mm, but it doesn't
feel the same.

07:26.434 --> 07:29.634
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

07:31.067 --> 07:34.968
Deva had one just like this.
She loved this thing.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.033
She slept with it,
took it to school with her.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.701
We read "The Last Unicorn"
together when she was little.

07:42.734 --> 07:44.834
It was her favorite book.

07:46.734 --> 07:50.100
"I would enter
your sleep if I could

07:50.133 --> 07:52.501
and guard you there..."

07:52.534 --> 07:55.200
uh, something something.

07:55.234 --> 07:57.434
"But I cannot enter
unless you dream of me."

07:57.467 --> 07:59.467
There you go.

07:59.501 --> 08:02.467
- You read
"The Last Unicorn"?
- In prison.

08:02.501 --> 08:04.601
It was a small library.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.234
What is it?

08:13.267 --> 08:14.934
Nothing.

08:14.968 --> 08:16.968
Tell me.

08:18.801 --> 08:20.400
I just...

08:20.434 --> 08:24.334
the whole time
I was away, I thought
I knew what I was missing.

08:24.367 --> 08:27.567
Turns out, I only knew
the half of it.

08:27.601 --> 08:29.667
You should buy it for her.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.701
- This a Revell?
- <i>Good eye.</i>

08:51.734 --> 08:54.501
You a modeler?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.601
Once upon a time.

08:57.701 --> 09:00.634
- How much?
- It's 10.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.767
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:09.234 --> 09:11.934
I wouldn't have pegged you
for the model airplane type.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.701
When I was a kid,

09:14.734 --> 09:18.100
about the only time
I spent with the old man--

09:18.133 --> 09:20.334
building model planes.

09:22.067 --> 09:23.534
In all the time
I've known you,

09:23.567 --> 09:25.367
you've never once
mentioned your father.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.400
Really?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.767
There's no reason
to start now.

10:03.868 --> 10:06.033
What is it?

10:06.067 --> 10:07.767
It's nothing.

10:07.801 --> 10:09.234
Nothing.

10:11.234 --> 10:13.934
Security camera,
upper right-hand corner
on a swivel.

10:13.968 --> 10:15.834
<i>Won't do them any good</i>
<i>if they get hit at night.</i>

10:15.868 --> 10:18.400
<i>You've been away too long.</i>
<i>See that ring around</i>
<i>the outside lens?</i>

10:18.434 --> 10:21.334
That's LED lighting.
Finds you in the dark.

10:22.734 --> 10:25.200
But that Vicon
in the window display...

10:25.234 --> 10:27.334
- <i>That's a camera?</i>
- <i>Yeah, it's wireless.</i>

10:27.367 --> 10:29.400
It's no problem
throwing off the signal.

10:29.434 --> 10:31.834
Totally Mickey Mouse.

10:31.868 --> 10:33.701
Listen to you.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.968
Well, it is.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.567
You know, if the safe
is the same make,

10:37.601 --> 10:39.868
this place would
be child's play.

10:43.801 --> 10:45.267
But if you get
jammed up front...

10:45.300 --> 10:47.534
There is an alley running
behind the whole block.

10:47.567 --> 10:49.300
<i>I'm sure they have</i>
<i>a door to it.</i>

10:49.334 --> 10:50.968
Look at you.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.234
What?

10:59.267 --> 11:00.834
That car.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.501
- <i>A tail?</i>
- Lucas: <i>I don't know.</i>

11:05.534 --> 11:07.367
- But you've
tagged it before?
- Twice.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.734
Where?

11:08.767 --> 11:11.300
Next street up,
down a block to the right.

11:11.334 --> 11:13.901
- The driver?
- Couldn't see.
Tinted windows.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.767
I'll bring the truck
around front.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.501
Right.

12:41.133 --> 12:43.367
- Behind.
- I know.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.501
Wait here.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.267
Excuse me.
Is everything okay?

13:17.300 --> 13:20.334
Yeah, sorry.
I thought this was
a friend of mine's car.

13:25.801 --> 13:28.367
Would you mind
just giving me a hand?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.267
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:30.300 --> 13:33.300
Guess I got
too much stuff.

13:41.033 --> 13:43.033
Thanks.

15:03.901 --> 15:06.100
Where are you going?

15:06.133 --> 15:08.601
Turnpike's that way.

15:08.634 --> 15:11.701
Yeah, I thought we could
take a little detour.

15:13.734 --> 15:15.934
Something I want
to show you.

15:15.968 --> 15:17.100
What is it?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.634
Won't take more
than a couple hours.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.734
Unless you're in
a hurry to get home.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.100
Home.

15:58.868 --> 16:00.534
Wait.

16:12.334 --> 16:13.968
<i>I got you something.</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:16.367
It's where we're going.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.701
<i>It's our house.</i>

16:47.968 --> 16:49.667
It's the house.

16:57.801 --> 17:02.300
<i>I figured we could,</i>
<i>I don't know,</i>

17:02.334 --> 17:04.834
disappear here.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.534
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>you own this?</i>

17:08.567 --> 17:10.901
Paid cash.

17:10.934 --> 17:13.701
Set up a trust
for the taxes.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.467
Just wanted
you to see it.

17:42.534 --> 17:44.701
It was a good plan.

18:35.968 --> 18:38.200
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I've been thinking.</i>

18:39.734 --> 18:42.501
It's probably time
for me to be moving on.

18:44.501 --> 18:47.267
<i>Ever since</i>
<i>I got to Banshee,</i>

18:47.300 --> 18:49.200
<i>things have--</i>

18:49.234 --> 18:52.501
well, I've made things
worse for you,

18:52.534 --> 18:54.601
your family.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.634
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>that wasn't the plan,</i>

18:56.667 --> 18:59.434
<i>but that's what happened.</i>

18:59.467 --> 19:02.434
You tried to tell me.

19:08.434 --> 19:13.067
<i>Anyway, I can't play</i>
<i>lawman forever,</i>

19:13.100 --> 19:14.734
<i>can I?</i>

19:15.801 --> 19:19.567
Yeah, but where
would you go?

19:21.701 --> 19:23.801
What would you do?

19:25.701 --> 19:28.167
Um...

19:28.200 --> 19:30.267
just go.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.601
<i>Maybe come back here.</i>

19:35.601 --> 19:37.701
<i>I don't know.</i>

19:41.300 --> 19:44.767
I just can't keep doing
the things I've been
doing to people.

19:50.634 --> 19:52.367
No more.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.234
No more.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.934
When I got out
and I found you,

20:09.968 --> 20:13.033
you had a home,
a family.

20:13.067 --> 20:16.934
You had all the things
you were supposed
to have with me.

20:16.968 --> 20:18.934
And that fucking killed me.

20:22.767 --> 20:24.734
Then I saw Deva.

20:26.534 --> 20:29.467
And the truth is
I just didn't want to go.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.100
<i>So I told myself</i>

20:36.133 --> 20:38.133
that by staying,
I was protecting you.

20:38.167 --> 20:40.234
- From Rabbit.
- Yeah.

20:43.234 --> 20:45.934
<i>I mean, I believed it.</i>

20:45.968 --> 20:48.901
I really believed it.

20:48.934 --> 20:51.400
But he was always
really after me.

20:53.067 --> 20:55.400
It was never you.

20:57.067 --> 20:58.767
So...

21:01.868 --> 21:04.901
best thing I can do
for you is to leave.

23:28.801 --> 23:30.334
What is it?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.501
Well, maybe nothing.
Stay there.

25:44.067 --> 25:47.234
- Sheriff Hood.
- Agent Racine.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.033
Let's go.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.801
The FBI dropped in
for a visit.

25:54.834 --> 25:57.367
- So I see.
- Mrs. Hopewell.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.968
Congratulations

26:00.000 --> 26:02.734
on your release
from prison.

26:07.901 --> 26:10.434
Sit anywhere.

26:10.467 --> 26:12.567
You won't
be needing that.

26:12.601 --> 26:15.334
<i>Maybe. You want to tell us</i>
<i>why you're here?</i>

26:15.367 --> 26:18.701
Heard you had a visitor
while you were inside.

26:18.734 --> 26:21.601
Oh, you knew?

26:21.634 --> 26:23.634
After the fact.

26:25.067 --> 26:26.567
You don't know me well.

26:26.601 --> 26:30.267
If you did, you'd know
that putting Rabbit down

26:30.300 --> 26:32.000
is pretty much it
for me.

26:32.033 --> 26:35.067
<i>Why? What is it between</i>
<i>you and Rabbit?</i>

26:38.133 --> 26:40.434
When I was a young agent...

26:41.968 --> 26:43.968
I worked a few angles.

26:45.067 --> 26:46.634
Got Rabbit's case
for myself.

26:46.667 --> 26:50.200
I figured I'd grab
a few headlines,

26:50.267 --> 26:52.267
move up the ladder.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.334
But I busted him
too soon.

26:55.367 --> 26:57.133
His lawyers shredded me.

26:57.167 --> 26:59.667
Got my wiretaps
thrown out.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.334
A week later,
my confidential informant

27:03.400 --> 27:06.133
was murdered in Astoria

27:06.167 --> 27:08.834
along with his wife

27:08.868 --> 27:10.934
and two daughters.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.834
So the way I see it,

27:15.868 --> 27:17.267
those little girls

27:17.300 --> 27:20.234
and anyone else
he's killed since then,

27:20.267 --> 27:22.400
they're all on me.

27:24.133 --> 27:26.234
You have an ashtray?

27:28.434 --> 27:31.300
Never even tried to quit.
Loved it too much.

27:31.334 --> 27:35.534
And now they tell me
I don't have too much
time left.

27:35.567 --> 27:37.634
Six months.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.067
A year.

27:39.100 --> 27:42.100
I don't know what happens
to us when we die,

27:42.133 --> 27:45.534
but I don't want
to go out with all
those deaths on my head.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.834
Yeah, that's touching,
but it still doesn't explain
why you're following us.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.934
Waiting for her to get out.

27:50.968 --> 27:53.334
Figured Rabbit
would be waiting, too.

27:53.367 --> 27:54.801
I still think that.

27:54.834 --> 27:56.300
So you're using
us as bait?

27:56.334 --> 27:57.868
- Exactly.
- But you're wrong.

27:57.901 --> 28:01.234
<i>He's not coming.</i>
<i>He's tired, worn out.</i>

28:01.267 --> 28:04.033
- He's given up.
- What about you, Sheriff?

28:04.067 --> 28:07.534
You also believe
our Rabbit has decided
to forgive and forget?

28:07.567 --> 28:10.200
- No.
- You think he knows
my father better than I do?

28:10.234 --> 28:12.734
It's not about what he knows.
It's about what I know.

28:12.767 --> 28:15.601
So when Rabbit shows up,
you plan to be there.

28:15.634 --> 28:18.133
That's right.
Then deliver him
to justice.

28:18.167 --> 28:20.133
By which I mean
shoot him till he's dead.

28:20.167 --> 28:22.834
And if we get
killed in the process,
that's just too bad?

28:22.868 --> 28:25.000
You don't have anyone
to blame but yourself.

28:25.033 --> 28:27.601
You had him
at point-blank range.

28:27.634 --> 28:29.033
You think of it,

28:29.067 --> 28:31.567
you should thank me
for having your back.

28:31.601 --> 28:33.801
<i>Did you hear the man?</i>
<i>We should be thanking him.</i>

28:33.834 --> 28:36.000
- How about that?
- We should be working
together.

28:36.033 --> 28:37.300
- <i>We can't.</i>
- Why not?

28:37.334 --> 28:39.534
- Because we don't trust you.
- You should.

28:39.567 --> 28:42.067
You of all people.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.067
Why?

28:45.601 --> 28:48.567
For starters,
I know you're not
Lucas Hood.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.033
Hey, hey, hey.

28:57.133 --> 29:01.133
My gun is in
the large compartment.

29:06.434 --> 29:09.334
I'm still waiting
to hear what you
got to say.

29:11.634 --> 29:15.267
15 years ago,
Capital Diamond Company.

29:17.167 --> 29:19.501
I'm sorry?

29:19.534 --> 29:21.868
Two thieves broke in
that night

29:21.901 --> 29:23.734
and one got away.

29:23.767 --> 29:27.133
He or she
was never caught.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.400
But you weren't
so lucky, were you?

29:31.534 --> 29:35.300
<i>I was there watching that cop</i>
<i>Bonner interrogate you.</i>

29:35.334 --> 29:37.801
<i>You didn't give him</i>
<i>a thing.</i>

29:37.834 --> 29:40.033
Hell, we still
don't know your real name.

29:40.067 --> 29:41.767
Then I show up
in Banshee

29:41.801 --> 29:44.133
<i>and there you are.</i>

29:44.167 --> 29:45.868
Lucas Hood.

29:45.901 --> 29:47.868
<i>A sheriff, no less.</i>

29:47.901 --> 29:50.267
I think you must
have me confused--

29:50.300 --> 29:52.100
No, no, don't.

29:52.133 --> 29:54.634
Don't waste my time.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.934
Those bodies your people
dug up in the woods,

29:58.968 --> 30:00.501
one of them was stolen.

30:00.534 --> 30:02.234
Someone wanted
that body gone

30:02.267 --> 30:06.033
before any DNA trace
samples could be taken.

30:06.067 --> 30:08.367
Turns out there was more
than enough DNA on the clothes

30:08.400 --> 30:10.868
that poor sucker
was wearing when he died.

30:10.901 --> 30:14.100
And the DNA belonged
to one Lucas Hood.

30:16.133 --> 30:20.200
He had his blood
profiled like everyone
else in law enforcement.

30:21.767 --> 30:25.901
So that makes you
something of a mystery,
doesn't it?

30:31.400 --> 30:33.300
Would you mind

30:33.334 --> 30:36.200
putting a little
water in this?

30:55.267 --> 30:57.367
He knows who you are.
You can't let him leave.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.567
Enough people
have died over this.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.501
<i>So...</i>

31:09.834 --> 31:11.801
can I count on
your cooperation?

31:17.501 --> 31:19.567
No more.

31:29.701 --> 31:32.133
So we help you
find Rabbit...

31:36.501 --> 31:38.033
what happens next?

31:38.067 --> 31:42.067
You do that,
as far as I'm concerned,

31:42.100 --> 31:45.300
I never even have to ask
the next question.

31:45.334 --> 31:47.734
What question?

31:49.334 --> 31:52.000
What question?

31:52.033 --> 31:55.300
Just who the hell
you really are.

32:08.300 --> 32:09.834
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:09.868 --> 32:11.734
Stay there.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.901
On three.

32:42.934 --> 32:45.100
<i>Okay?</i>

34:29.501 --> 34:31.067
<i>Hey!</i>

35:13.667 --> 35:16.234
Shit.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.300
Rabbit.

38:33.234 --> 38:35.934
He's never gonna
stop coming.

38:35.968 --> 38:38.767
Not until we're both dead.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.467
Nope.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.200
I'm here.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.934
<i>* Oh </i>

39:54.968 --> 40:00.567
<i>* You're the guilty one </i>

40:00.601 --> 40:05.234
<i>* 'Cause you held the gun </i>

40:08.434 --> 40:13.334
<i>* Save your only soul </i>

40:17.267 --> 40:21.133
<i>* Can you pull</i>
<i>the trigger? *</i>

40:22.567 --> 40:25.334
<i>* Let it go </i>

40:27.000 --> 40:33.334
<i>* End the games</i>
<i>you know *</i>

40:35.701 --> 40:41.701
<i>* And I can't smell</i>
<i>the flowers *</i>

40:41.734 --> 40:43.901
<i>* Ooh ooh </i>

40:43.934 --> 40:47.767
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh... </i>

41:05.167 --> 41:07.701
Hmm.

41:07.734 --> 41:10.167
- Back from the hill.
- <i>Yep.</i>

41:16.234 --> 41:20.367
So you back a day late,
aren't you?

41:21.801 --> 41:24.100
Yeah, we took
a detour.

41:31.734 --> 41:34.567
So how'd it go?

41:35.834 --> 41:37.767
Someone tried
to kill us.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.567
Was it Rabbit's people?

41:45.634 --> 41:48.767
He's still
out there, huh?
What happened?

41:50.667 --> 41:52.501
Okay.

41:52.534 --> 41:56.000
Well, I guess

41:56.033 --> 41:58.567
you won't be leaving
just yet.

41:59.901 --> 42:02.033
I can't.

42:03.334 --> 42:06.067
I can't say I'm sorry

42:06.100 --> 42:09.167
to have you around
a bit longer.

42:10.634 --> 42:13.067
What can I say?
You keep me young.

42:13.100 --> 42:15.100
Hmm?

42:24.367 --> 42:27.767
And you're very generous
with my whiskey.

42:27.801 --> 42:30.267
Especially
my good whiskey.

42:37.033 --> 42:38.868
You know,

42:38.901 --> 42:42.133
every time I think
I know the way forward...

42:44.267 --> 42:48.100
something just kicks me
back on my ass, you know?

42:49.701 --> 42:51.801
It's like, you know...

42:54.467 --> 42:56.300
it's...

43:00.234 --> 43:02.100
Fuck, I don't know.

43:02.133 --> 43:05.434
Like you're
still inside.

43:06.834 --> 43:09.300
People like you and me,

43:09.334 --> 43:12.234
we don't need bars.

43:12.267 --> 43:14.467
We build our own cells.

43:14.501 --> 43:17.734
<i>When you live</i>
<i>like we live,</i>

43:17.767 --> 43:19.734
<i>it goes without saying.</i>

43:19.767 --> 43:21.934
<i>We're gonna find</i>
<i>ourselves in places</i>

43:21.968 --> 43:24.400
<i>we never imagined</i>
<i>we'd be</i>

43:24.434 --> 43:28.234
<i>looking back and wondering</i>
<i>how the hell we got there</i>

43:28.267 --> 43:32.601
<i>and why the hell it seems</i>
<i>you can't leave.</i>

43:34.067 --> 43:36.901
<i>There's something</i>
<i>broken in us.</i>

43:36.934 --> 43:40.734
<i>Something that we don't have</i>
<i>that other people do</i>

43:40.767 --> 43:44.601
<i>that lets them settle down</i>
<i>and find peace</i>

43:44.634 --> 43:47.400
<i>and dream of a better life.</i>

43:48.400 --> 43:50.367
<i>People like you and me,</i>

43:50.400 --> 43:53.000
<i>we can't afford</i>
<i>those dreams.</i>

43:53.033 --> 43:55.734
<i>Why not?</i>

43:55.767 --> 43:58.634
<i>Because of what</i>
<i>we have done.</i>

44:01.133 --> 44:05.334
<i>There are ghosts</i>
<i>that just won't let us be.</i>

44:16.067 --> 44:17.601
Fuck that.

44:33.934 --> 44:37.334
<i>* All </i>

44:37.367 --> 44:41.601
<i>* My lying life </i>

44:42.434 --> 44:45.934
<i>* Is strife </i>

44:49.701 --> 44:54.000
<i>* Encumbrances </i>

44:54.033 --> 44:57.100
<i>* I have shouldered </i>

44:59.133 --> 45:05.234
<i>* Inside my head </i>

45:06.000 --> 45:09.067
<i>* I disa-- </i>

45:10.234 --> 45:13.601
<i>* I disappear </i>

45:14.400 --> 45:17.767
<i>* I disappear </i>

45:18.634 --> 45:22.934
<i>* Into the light </i>

45:23.667 --> 45:27.267
<i>* Light </i>

45:28.968 --> 45:32.634
<i>* Light. </i>
