00:14.982 --> 00:16.982
Kill, kill, kill!

00:16.984 --> 00:19.051
Die, die, die!

00:19.053 --> 00:21.487
Gotcha!
Come on, come on!

00:25.659 --> 00:27.626
Mom, I thought you said
10 more minutes.

00:27.628 --> 00:31.463
That was 20 minutes ago.
Upstairs. Now.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.799
I hate you.

00:33.801 --> 00:36.235
- And no playing on your phone!
- Ugh!

00:36.237 --> 00:38.437
You never let me
do anything!

00:40.808 --> 00:42.474
I'll talk to him.

00:53.988 --> 00:56.021
Gabriel...

00:56.023 --> 00:57.523
you know why it's important

00:57.525 --> 00:59.625
to listen to your mother,
don't you?

01:01.295 --> 01:04.430
Because if you don't,
the Cucuy will get you.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.465
The what?

01:06.467 --> 01:09.868
You mean your mother never
told you about the Cucuy?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.203
Uh-uh.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.237
Ah.

01:14.308 --> 01:19.011
They say that he goes
from house to house every night,

01:19.013 --> 01:22.448
looking for children
who have misbehaved.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.684
And when he finds them,
he hides,

01:25.686 --> 01:28.987
waiting till they're all alone.

01:28.989 --> 01:34.126
In fact, he could
be here right now.

01:35.396 --> 01:38.030
Maybe he's hiding
under your bed.

01:38.032 --> 01:40.999
Or maybe...

01:41.001 --> 01:43.836
he's in the closet.

01:43.838 --> 01:46.538
He comes out
when you're sleeping.

01:46.540 --> 01:50.442
He puts you in his sack
and takes you to his cave...

01:53.047 --> 01:56.215
where he eats you.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.016
What are you talking about
in here?

01:58.018 --> 02:01.386
Oh,<i> mijito</i> and I
were just talking about

02:01.388 --> 02:04.256
how important it is for children
to listen to their parents.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.524
- Weren't we,<i> mijito?</i>
- Yes.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.859
Yes.

02:06.861 --> 02:09.061
- Ready to go, Mama?
- Yes.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.497
Do you have to go?

02:11.499 --> 02:14.366
Someone has to take
your <i> abuelita</i> home.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.171
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

02:27.081 --> 02:29.381
Javi, we're leaving now.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.429
Javi?

03:30.945 --> 03:31.977
Javi!

03:31.979 --> 03:33.579
Man!

03:33.581 --> 03:35.948
You gotta stop believing
that crap Grandma reads you.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.816
You jerk!

03:39.153 --> 03:41.486
Oh, that's too good.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.924
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

03:45.926 --> 03:48.026
<i>Javi!</i>

03:48.028 --> 03:49.661
Oh, this is priceless.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.729
<i>Javi!</i>

04:03.444 --> 04:05.043
Gabe?

04:23.297 --> 04:26.164
Javi, what are you doing?

04:29.336 --> 04:30.902
There's someone out there.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.204
Where?

04:35.542 --> 04:36.875
There was.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.311
Just leave me alone.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.894
Javi, what's going on?
I'm scared!

05:28.896 --> 05:30.962
- Hide now!
- Okay.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.174
Shh.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.201
Oh, my God!

06:26.420 --> 06:29.287
Javi?

06:29.289 --> 06:31.289
Javi?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.525
Javi!

07:11.799 --> 07:13.899
There she is.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.233
Gross.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.602
She can't even hear us.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.844
Smelly Melly.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.855
- Hey!
- What's the matter?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.690
- You can't hear without this?
- Give it back!

07:38.692 --> 07:40.926
Hey, can you hear this?

07:42.930 --> 07:44.496
Here.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.833
If you want this,
you gotta catch us.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.601
Come on, let's go! Go!

07:55.375 --> 07:57.676
Stop! Please! Wait!

07:57.678 --> 08:00.245
Go, go, go!

08:00.247 --> 08:01.446
Crap.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.617
Move!

08:07.855 --> 08:08.920
Please!

08:08.922 --> 08:10.455
Later, loser!

08:12.426 --> 08:13.992
Adios!

08:17.231 --> 08:19.464
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:19.466 --> 08:20.966
Well, if it isn't
the big sister.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.400
I told you,
leave her alone!

08:22.402 --> 08:23.768
Sofie!

08:23.770 --> 08:26.438
It's not my fault
she's a reject!

08:26.440 --> 08:27.539
Ooh!

08:27.541 --> 08:28.540
Stop! Hey, stop!

08:33.413 --> 08:35.046
- Stop resisting!
- Come on!

08:35.048 --> 08:36.982
Didn't you see
what they were doing to her?

08:36.984 --> 08:38.850
Let me go!

08:59.339 --> 09:00.772
What the hell is going on?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.908
I told him it was an accident!

09:02.910 --> 09:04.943
Your daughter assaulted
a police officer.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.112
I was trying
to protect Amelia, Mom.

09:07.114 --> 09:11.016
He just came up behind me.
I didn't know it was a cop.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.220
Come with me, please.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.827
Take them down to my office.
Be right there.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.798
Think you have problems, Sofia?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.433
Think about that poor family.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.702
There has to be
something that you can do.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.370
She's your niece,
for Christ's sakes!

09:32.372 --> 09:34.706
It's a felony, Rebecca.
There are regulations to follow.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.242
Regulations?
And this is how you do it?

09:39.813 --> 09:42.347
Sofia Alondra Martin.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.015
As your attorney has advised,

09:44.017 --> 09:46.651
this charge carries a minimum
sentence of six months

09:46.653 --> 09:48.853
in a juvenile detention center.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.724
In light of your father's death

09:52.726 --> 09:55.694
and other extenuating
circumstances,

09:55.696 --> 09:59.497
I'm sentencing you
to six months of house arrest.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.666
You will wear an ankle monitor,

10:01.668 --> 10:04.502
and you will not be allowed
to leave the premises

10:04.504 --> 10:07.472
without expressed permission.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.975
Ms. Martin,
I strongly urge you

10:09.977 --> 10:13.311
to consider the leniency
you've been shown here today.

10:13.313 --> 10:18.216
And I assure you, young lady,
it will not happen again.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.851
Am I clear?

10:19.853 --> 10:22.520
Yes, Your Honor.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.090
This court is adjourned.

10:29.696 --> 10:32.430
You know that I'm picking up
extra shifts at the hotel

10:32.432 --> 10:34.432
just to keep a roof
over our heads

10:34.434 --> 10:37.836
and food on the table.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.272
All I asked was for a little
help taking care of your sister.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.710
Sofe?

10:45.712 --> 10:49.247
I know things have been
rough since your dad died.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.183
I just...

10:52.185 --> 10:56.221
I just need a little time to
get us back on our feet, okay?

11:38.632 --> 11:41.433
Wow, I can't believe somebody
actually rented that place.

11:41.435 --> 11:42.567
Mom!

11:52.846 --> 11:54.579
Christ.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.281
Are you okay?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.283
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:34.654 --> 12:35.720
Whoo!

13:11.992 --> 13:13.625
Amelia.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.673
Well.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.110
Guess St. Stephen's
has the day off.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.693
Murphy,
when did you get hot?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.238
What are you up to?

14:08.381 --> 14:09.681
Whoa.

14:19.593 --> 14:23.194
Amelia, what would you like
for dinner?

14:27.567 --> 14:30.902
I thought Mom was coming home.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.472
She called.
She has to work.

14:34.474 --> 14:38.743
But that's okay because
we can do something special,

14:38.745 --> 14:41.312
just you and me.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.348
What do you say?

14:45.652 --> 14:48.786
Hey, is something wrong?

14:50.457 --> 14:53.591
You're lucky you don't
have to go to school.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.894
Did something happen?
Amelia!

15:11.645 --> 15:13.011
I don't even understand

15:13.013 --> 15:15.513
why they're bothering
with a memorial.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.515
I mean, if Teresa
actually had friends,

15:17.517 --> 15:19.550
she probably wouldn't
have done it.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.500
Jesse just texted me.

15:35.502 --> 15:39.871
Okay, first of all,
we've only kissed like once.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.372
No, he's not coming over.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.409
My parents are gonna be home
in like an hour.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.553
I'm gonna call you back,
all right?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.021
Okay, bye.

17:22.909 --> 17:23.974
<i>911 Emergency.</i>

17:23.977 --> 17:25.476
There's someone in my house.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.579
<i>Okay, miss,
who's in your house?</i>

17:28.581 --> 17:30.515
Please hurry.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.950
<i>Are you safe in the house
until the police arrive?</i>

17:35.622 --> 17:36.821
<i>Miss?</i>

17:38.291 --> 17:39.557
<i>Miss?</i>

17:49.836 --> 17:51.669
<i>Malo.</i>

18:27.874 --> 18:29.340
<i>Liberty Police

18:29.342 --> 18:31.209

18:33.346 --> 18:35.413
<i>from her family home.</i>

18:35.415 --> 18:38.516
<i>At the scene, Sierra's mother

18:38.518 --> 18:40.852
<i>Whoever has taken

18:40.854 --> 18:45.022
<i>if you're listening,

18:45.024 --> 18:48.326
<i>If anyone saw anything,

18:48.328 --> 18:51.429
<i>please call the police

18:51.431 --> 18:53.931
<i>Already reeling

18:53.933 --> 18:55.700
<i>the small-town

<i>Starting tonight,

19:01.908 --> 19:04.542
Hey, guys, finish up.
We're gonna be late.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.881
They didn't do all that
for Javier.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.422
Those posts I saw online
last night,

19:18.424 --> 19:20.992
that was her, wasn't it?

20:07.774 --> 20:09.707
What's he doing?

20:13.513 --> 20:16.214
Keeping someone down there?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.791
You scared the hell out of me!

21:00.793 --> 21:04.862
Are you, uh,
watching that house?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.331
- I...
- I get it.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.734
Creepy guy, creepy house.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.502
No, no, it's not
what you think.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.337
Oh, so you weren't
watching him.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.008
Let me show you something.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.876
Follow me.

21:22.548 --> 21:25.249
Is this really
what the judge had in mind

21:25.251 --> 21:27.151
when he gave you
house arrest?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.720
You don't think it's weird?
Those two kids disappeared

21:29.722 --> 21:32.089
right around the time
this guy moves in.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.059
You think he did it?

21:35.061 --> 21:36.761
Yeah, or he's involved.

21:36.763 --> 21:37.928
Because he bought chains?

21:37.930 --> 21:39.230
And lye.

21:39.232 --> 21:41.232
Well, maybe he's making soap.

21:41.234 --> 21:42.733
Okay.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.835
Have you been watching
the whole neighborhood

21:44.837 --> 21:46.203
from in here?

21:47.273 --> 21:48.372
You ever watch me?

21:48.374 --> 21:51.909
No, no, of course not.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.245
I mean,
not like specifically.

21:54.247 --> 21:56.947
You are such a liar.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.383
- Okay.
- What have you seen?

21:59.385 --> 22:00.918
Like I said,

22:00.920 --> 22:05.623
I don't really make a habit
of watching you.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.726
Uh-huh.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.198
How's your hand?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.567
It's-- It's fine.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.705
Remember back in fourth grade?

22:20.707 --> 22:21.706
Mm-hmm.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.874
In Ms. Fiorello's class.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.710
You got stung by that bee.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.879
First of all,
it was a hornet.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.782
Second of all,
it really hurt, so...

22:31.784 --> 22:33.484
Uh-oh.

22:33.486 --> 22:35.586
What? What?

22:35.588 --> 22:37.655
It looks infected.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.623
We're definitely gonna
have to amputate.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.225
- Hey!
- Where's that hacksaw?

22:41.227 --> 22:42.326
Shut up!

22:44.764 --> 22:48.766
You know, if you're gonna keep
peeking through my window,

22:48.768 --> 22:50.968
the least I could do is,
I don't know,

22:50.970 --> 22:53.504
text you when I'm doing
something worth watching.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.639
Oh, how considerate.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.308
Put in your number.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.077
Are all the boys
at St. Stephen's

23:00.079 --> 23:01.812
this chivalrous?

23:01.814 --> 23:05.816
Maybe when you get parole,
you could come and find out.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.051
Cute.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.654
I am gonna need
my phone back though.

23:10.656 --> 23:11.655
Right, of course.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.493
See you around.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.462
- I know.
- You know what I mean.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.897
[chu

23:19.899 --> 23:22.900
You're one freaky gal,
Sofia Martin.

23:29.442 --> 23:31.475
Sierra?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.283
Sierra!

23:39.285 --> 23:41.752
Sierra, where are you going?

23:46.492 --> 23:48.759
Screw it.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.095
I got three minutes.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.364
Okay, let's do this.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.357
Sierra.

24:20.359 --> 24:23.160
Um, I think you're confused.

24:52.124 --> 24:54.225
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.293
What the hell
are you doing here?

24:56.295 --> 24:57.695
I thought you were
under house arrest.

24:57.697 --> 24:58.896
I don't want any trouble.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.197
You don't want any trouble?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.532
You should've thought about that

25:01.534 --> 25:03.067
before you hit my boy
with your car.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.170
Oh, you got an important date?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.873
Look, I just need
to get back, okay? Please.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.909
Unfortunately, your uncle isn't
bailing you out this time.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.277
Just back off!

25:15.515 --> 25:18.415
Oh, looks like your time
is running out.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.783
Tick tock, bitch.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.253
<i>Attention.</i>

26:29.255 --> 26:32.222
<i>Starting tonight,
there is a curfew of 7 p.m.</i>

26:32.224 --> 26:34.992
<i>for all residents
under the age of 18.</i>

26:34.994 --> 26:37.394
<i>All residents
under the age of 18</i>

26:37.396 --> 26:39.229
<i>are required to be
back in their homes.</i>

26:39.231 --> 26:40.931
Come on,
we can get in the back.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.834
<i>Again, 7 p.m.
for all residents...</i>

26:48.140 --> 26:49.373
Hey.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.978
- You guys remember her?
- Remember her?

26:53.980 --> 26:56.680
Can't believe it's already been
a year since she killed herself.

26:56.682 --> 26:57.982
Classic.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.550
Rest in peace.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.486
Someone there?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.201
What the hell?

28:05.851 --> 28:07.117
Hello?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.384
Guys, guys, we gotta go now!

28:40.386 --> 28:42.119
Guys, we gotta go right now!

28:42.121 --> 28:44.922
We gotta go! Dude, dude!
We gotta go right now!

28:44.924 --> 28:46.757
- Dude, you're freaking me out.
- There's something else here.

28:46.759 --> 28:50.060
I saw it downstairs.
Please, we gotta go, please!

29:15.154 --> 29:17.287
<i>Malo.</i>

29:20.459 --> 29:23.327
No, please, no!
No! No!

29:23.329 --> 29:27.898
No, no, no, no!
Please, please, no!

29:27.900 --> 29:28.932
No!

30:56.956 --> 30:58.255
He's coming for you.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.771
As some of you
might have already heard,

31:14.773 --> 31:18.141
last night, 16-year-old
Travis Baines disappeared

31:18.143 --> 31:21.778
from the vicinity of
Glimmer Peak Junior High School.

31:21.780 --> 31:24.014
Chief Martin, what are you
doing to find these children?

31:24.016 --> 31:25.549
What are you doing
to find my boy?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.050
And my daughter.

31:27.052 --> 31:28.518
How many children
have to disappear

31:28.520 --> 31:30.954
before you realize
we have a crisis?

31:30.956 --> 31:32.522
My son
goes to school here!

31:32.524 --> 31:34.524
Is it true they all went
to the same school?

31:34.526 --> 31:37.294
This have anything to do
with Teresa Fuentes' suicide?

31:37.296 --> 31:39.630
Yeah, we wanna know
what you're doing!

31:39.632 --> 31:43.734
Look, as of now, last night
we instituted a curfew,

31:43.736 --> 31:46.403
which will be continuing
for the foreseeable future.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.339
Does Glimmer Peak
have a serial killer?

31:49.341 --> 31:50.874
It's still an ongoing case,

31:50.876 --> 31:53.210
so I'm not gonna discuss
specifics at this time.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.012
Chief!

31:55.014 --> 31:56.713
What about the Cucuy?

31:56.715 --> 31:58.315
I'm sorry, the what?

31:58.317 --> 32:00.017
El Cucuy.

32:00.019 --> 32:02.052
Comes in the middle
of the night.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.154
Take away youngsters
that won't listen.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.690
Keeps them for a while,
fattens them up,

32:06.692 --> 32:08.992
eats them, body and soul.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.661
You better get yourself
a nice <i> abuelita,</i> Chief.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.165
Shut up!
This is serious!

32:15.167 --> 32:17.834
Look, all I can
say is of now that my department

32:17.836 --> 32:19.236
is doing everything
we can to make sure

32:19.238 --> 32:20.938
these horrific events
come to a close

32:20.940 --> 32:24.007
as quickly
and safely as possible.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.375
Next question?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.945
<i>- Si!</i>
<i>- </i> Over here!

32:29.949 --> 32:33.016
Then we split up
for a little bit.

32:33.018 --> 32:35.018
George went upstairs.

32:35.020 --> 32:37.054
Travis went off,
looking for stuff to take.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.556
What were you doing?

32:41.460 --> 32:43.961
I'm not gonna be charged
with anything, right?

32:43.963 --> 32:48.332
I just wanna get an idea of what
was going on inside the school.

32:50.803 --> 32:54.604
I was, um, tagging.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.039
Mostly lockers.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.941
You saw Travis again?

32:57.943 --> 32:59.643
Yeah, he came back.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.946
He looked kinda,
you know, creeped out.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.515
And that's when
you saw the kidnapper?

33:06.952 --> 33:10.053
Tell me about him.

33:10.055 --> 33:12.723
I don't know.
It was this guy.

33:12.725 --> 33:15.726
So male.

33:15.728 --> 33:20.297
He was wearing this...
this hood over his head,

33:20.299 --> 33:23.900
and he was carrying something.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.102
Like a bag.

33:25.104 --> 33:27.571
Did you get a look
at his face?

33:27.573 --> 33:29.339
Not great.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.844
He had red eyes.

33:33.846 --> 33:37.114
Like... glowing.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.792
He's leaving.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.029
- Let me go.
- No way.

33:52.031 --> 33:54.631
- You'll get in trouble.
- I'll have three minutes.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.633
- That's not enough time.
- Yes, it is.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.535
I'm gonna have
one minute upstairs,

33:58.537 --> 34:01.004
a couple in the basement,
and I'll come right back.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.739
I promise.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.315
Okay, this is our chance.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.604
- Hey, I got your call.
- Come in, come in.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.272
Who needs small talk?

35:16.949 --> 35:19.983
Ah, so, we're still
doing this, huh?

35:21.753 --> 35:24.621
Amelia's over there.

35:24.623 --> 35:28.191
You mean over there,
over there?

35:28.193 --> 35:29.426
Yeah.

35:30.929 --> 35:33.196
You had your little sister
break into the house

35:33.198 --> 35:34.865
of someone you think
is a kidnapper?

35:34.867 --> 35:36.566
That's not exactly
how it happened.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.602
Please tell me you at least
made sure he's not home.

35:38.604 --> 35:41.338
Yeah, he drove away
five minutes ago.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.492
Oh...

36:31.089 --> 36:33.857
You, of all people,
should be familiar

36:33.859 --> 36:36.459
with the concept
of law enforcement.

36:36.461 --> 36:38.695
I called you because I wanted
your help, not a lecture.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.664
Well, maybe you should've
called your uncle.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.667
You think I didn't?
He practically hung up on me.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.270
There's something
going on in there.

36:47.272 --> 36:48.705
I know it.

36:49.841 --> 36:52.542
I just need proof.

36:55.881 --> 36:59.182
Um, Sofie?

37:00.619 --> 37:02.319
What?

37:11.797 --> 37:13.430
No, no, no.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.099
He doesn't see her, does he?

39:32.003 --> 39:34.003
She's in the basement.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.973
Why isn't she moving?

39:39.845 --> 39:41.378
Oh, no.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.425
Can I help you?

40:28.427 --> 40:29.859
Yeah, hi, um...

40:31.196 --> 40:34.030
I-I was just wondering if...

40:34.032 --> 40:37.767
you've, uh, seen my cat.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.140
Wait, wait, wait!

41:28.353 --> 41:30.487
There was
a map of the town.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.490
He put pins where
all the kids went missing.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.627
He has photos of them.

41:43.034 --> 41:46.102
What are these articles about?

41:46.104 --> 41:48.104
Other missing kids.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.205
Jesus.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.274
I'm gonna call my uncle.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.476
We're gonna nail this nutbag.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.314
The Cucuy?

41:59.818 --> 42:01.050
Sofie?

42:03.722 --> 42:06.055
I've seen this.

42:07.359 --> 42:11.327
Yesterday, after you left,

42:11.329 --> 42:13.696
I saw this in the woods.

42:13.698 --> 42:14.964
Okay.

42:14.966 --> 42:18.868
But, uh, what's a coco?

42:18.870 --> 42:20.803
No, the Cucuy.

42:20.805 --> 42:23.506
My grandma
told me about him once.

42:23.508 --> 42:26.509
It's this silly story
parents tell their kids

42:26.511 --> 42:28.545
to frighten them
into behaving.

42:28.547 --> 42:31.814
Look here.

42:31.816 --> 42:34.083
"The Cucuy
is a mythical character,

42:34.085 --> 42:36.252
likened to the boogeyman,
that is popular

42:36.254 --> 42:38.888
in many Latin and
Central American countries.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.558
Stories about the Cucuy
are often told by parents

42:41.560 --> 42:45.395
as a way to convince
their unruly children to behave.

42:45.397 --> 42:47.163
According to the legend,

42:47.165 --> 42:48.364
the creature snatches
naughty children

42:48.366 --> 42:49.899
in the middle of the night

42:49.901 --> 42:52.335
and takes them back
to his cave to be eaten."

42:52.337 --> 42:54.504
Charming.

42:54.506 --> 42:56.506
"Countries all over the world

42:56.508 --> 42:58.207
have their own versions
of the legend.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.943
The "Bag Man" in Armenia,

42:59.945 --> 43:02.345
"Bori Baba"
or "Father Sack" in India,

43:02.347 --> 43:04.013
the "Krampus" in Germany.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.050
Where St. Nicholas would bring
good children presents,

43:07.052 --> 43:09.886
the Krampus would
take the bad children away."

43:09.888 --> 43:14.891
You don't think
it's possible, do you?

43:14.893 --> 43:16.759
That it's real?

43:16.761 --> 43:19.095
I mean, think about it.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.764
Sierra and Travis
were both bullies.

43:21.766 --> 43:25.068
Maybe this thing really is
taking misbehaving children.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.370
Come on.
How does one creature

43:27.372 --> 43:29.739
take all the bad kids
in the world, huh?

43:29.741 --> 43:31.874
I mean,
what's more believable?

43:31.876 --> 43:35.778
That some mythical boogeyman is
out there kidnapping children,

43:35.780 --> 43:38.081
or that some psychopath
in a Halloween costume

43:38.083 --> 43:40.083
wants to make you think it is?

43:40.085 --> 43:42.986
Hell, it's probably him.

43:42.988 --> 43:45.555
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

43:45.557 --> 43:47.223
Call your uncle.

43:47.225 --> 43:50.059
Show him the photos
that Amelia took.

43:50.061 --> 43:54.697
At the very least, it's enough
to get a search warrant.

43:56.001 --> 43:58.568
- No, I can't.
- Why not?

43:58.570 --> 44:00.336
Because that would mean
telling him

44:00.338 --> 44:02.305
that we broke into
the guy's house.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.240
I'm on probation, remember?

44:04.242 --> 44:07.443
Okay, well, then tell him
he left the door open

44:07.445 --> 44:10.113
or that you peered
through a window.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.316
Yeah, yeah, that could work.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.785
But I really think we should
keep this boogeyman thing

44:15.787 --> 44:18.621
to ourselves
for the time being, okay?

44:18.623 --> 44:20.123
What boogeyman thing?

44:20.125 --> 44:22.625
Nothing, Mom.

44:22.627 --> 44:24.360
You know the rules.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.796
No boys allowed in the bedroom
when I'm not here.

44:28.099 --> 44:30.099
Yeah.

44:30.101 --> 44:34.504
Oh, I should, uh,
get going anyway, so...

44:34.506 --> 44:37.540
Are you sure?
I brought Chinese.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.475
No, thanks, Mrs. Martin.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.477
Okay.

44:41.479 --> 44:42.879
Be careful.

44:47.052 --> 44:48.317
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:51.823 --> 44:55.224
So I heard Teresa's memorial
is coming up.

44:55.226 --> 44:57.226
I could take a day off,
and we can go together.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.761
What do you think?

45:02.233 --> 45:04.467
Okay.

45:04.469 --> 45:06.069
Finish up.
I need to get back to work,

45:06.071 --> 45:08.871
and I need you two
working on your homework.

45:12.577 --> 45:14.510
"Don't worry, Mom.

45:14.512 --> 45:16.546
I'll do the dishes."

45:40.071 --> 45:41.571
Close your windows.

45:41.573 --> 45:43.639
There's a storm coming, okay?

46:43.968 --> 46:45.168
Amelia.

46:55.914 --> 46:59.348
Amelia!
Amelia, are you okay?

47:00.752 --> 47:02.685
Sofie, Sofie!

47:02.687 --> 47:05.121
Amelia, what's going on?

47:06.124 --> 47:07.757
Amelia!

47:07.759 --> 47:09.358
Are you okay?

48:08.586 --> 48:11.487
No!

48:11.489 --> 48:15.091
No, not her! Please!
Don't take her! No!

48:15.093 --> 48:18.527
Help me, Sofie, please.
Help me.

48:20.565 --> 48:23.432
- I'm the one you want.
- Sofie, please!

48:23.434 --> 48:27.603
If there's someone here
who needs to be punished,

48:27.605 --> 48:29.205
it's me.

48:30.608 --> 48:32.775
I'm scared, Sofie.

48:32.777 --> 48:34.043
Help me.

48:39.450 --> 48:42.151
Leave her alone and take me!

48:46.391 --> 48:48.257
<i>Malo.</i>

48:51.062 --> 48:52.762
No, Sofie!

49:24.829 --> 49:27.029
Sofie, Sofie.

49:28.232 --> 49:30.199
Mom.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.934
Okay, okay.

49:31.936 --> 49:34.737
Okay, okay, okay, shh.

49:34.739 --> 49:35.738
What happened?

49:35.740 --> 49:37.273
Where is she?

49:37.275 --> 49:40.109
He took her.

49:40.111 --> 49:42.912
I tried to stop it,
but I couldn't, Mom, I couldn't.

49:42.914 --> 49:45.748
He who?
Did you see who did this?

49:47.018 --> 49:48.150
Sofie.

49:49.787 --> 49:53.089
Tell her what you told me,
or I will.

49:53.091 --> 49:56.225
Sofie, Sofie, honey,
if you saw anything,

49:56.227 --> 49:58.594
please,
you have to tell us.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.896
Come on, Sofie.

50:00.898 --> 50:03.966
She said it was the Cucuy.

50:05.470 --> 50:08.971
- That's a made-up--
- I know what I saw.

50:10.475 --> 50:14.710
He had a cloak,
just like in the pictures.

50:14.712 --> 50:17.780
Big sharp teeth and...

50:20.151 --> 50:22.018
red eyes.

50:26.924 --> 50:28.290
Red eyes.

50:32.296 --> 50:34.397
Wait, why?

50:34.399 --> 50:36.098
- It's nothing.
- Why'd you say that?

50:36.100 --> 50:38.267
- Nothing.
- Don't lie to me! Why?

50:38.269 --> 50:40.469
There was a kid at the school
with the Baines boy.

50:40.471 --> 50:43.072
Before he got taken,
he described something similar.

50:43.074 --> 50:46.075
Wait, so you knew about this,
and you didn't do anything?

50:46.077 --> 50:49.145
Knew about what,
the boogeyman?

50:49.147 --> 50:51.013
Look, I'm certain
that she saw something,

50:51.015 --> 50:53.149
but I guarantee you, it wasn't
some Mexican superstition.

50:53.151 --> 50:54.984
What does that have
to do with anything?

50:54.986 --> 50:56.285
It's probably
just a guy in a suit!

50:56.287 --> 50:59.488
There are four kids missing!

50:59.490 --> 51:02.291
My daughter, your niece!

51:02.293 --> 51:05.428
And the best that you can do is,
it's just some guy in a suit?

51:05.430 --> 51:08.597
Look, I assure you, my entire
staff is working on this.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.166
Are you sure about that?

51:10.168 --> 51:13.335
Sure it's not just
some Mexican superstition?

51:18.843 --> 51:21.477
Sofia...

51:21.479 --> 51:23.946
do you have any idea
who might have wanted

51:23.948 --> 51:26.315
to take your sister?

51:40.164 --> 51:42.832
Boyd Iverson! Police!

51:47.705 --> 51:48.904
Clear!

51:50.875 --> 51:52.007
Clear!

51:58.883 --> 52:00.683
Mr. Iverson?

52:09.760 --> 52:12.361
See if you can find the light.

52:26.210 --> 52:28.310
Gotcha, you son of a bitch.

52:29.447 --> 52:30.713
We got movement!

52:39.690 --> 52:41.790
What did he say?
Did he tell you where she is?

52:41.792 --> 52:42.958
We're searching the house.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.460
We're seeing if we can tie him

52:44.462 --> 52:47.429
to any other active cases
in the area, okay?

52:47.431 --> 52:49.698
We're gonna find her,
Rebecca.

52:49.700 --> 52:51.100
Okay, in the meantime,
I'm taking him downtown.

52:51.102 --> 52:53.369
Let's see what
a few hours in the tank

52:53.371 --> 52:55.504
doesn't do for his memory.

52:56.607 --> 52:59.041
Hey, try and get some rest.

53:17.895 --> 53:19.728
Hey.

53:19.730 --> 53:21.764
Do you know who I am?

53:24.468 --> 53:26.769
My little girl?

53:26.771 --> 53:29.838
Well, her daddy
passed away a year ago.

53:30.808 --> 53:32.775
Cancer.

53:32.777 --> 53:38.647
She had the privilege
of watching her daddy waste away

53:38.649 --> 53:41.350
one pound at a time.

53:41.352 --> 53:46.422
And now she's out there alone,

53:46.424 --> 53:51.527
taken by God knows what,
taken God knows where.

53:51.529 --> 53:56.198
So I am begging you,
please.

53:56.200 --> 53:59.668
Please help me.

54:11.182 --> 54:12.748
Tell me about the Cucuy.

54:15.519 --> 54:18.020
What do you know about him?

54:18.022 --> 54:19.722
I know he's not real,

54:19.724 --> 54:21.724
and I know he's not out there
kidnapping children.

54:21.726 --> 54:23.525
You're wrong.

54:23.527 --> 54:28.397
My brother had just turned nine
when the Cucuy took him.

54:28.399 --> 54:31.166
We broke into an old warehouse.

54:33.471 --> 54:36.005
We were playing hide and seek.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.509
I found him just in time
to see that son of a bitch

54:40.511 --> 54:42.678
throw him into his sack.

54:42.680 --> 54:47.583
I ran for help.
No one believed me.

54:47.585 --> 54:51.086
I thought I could stop it
from happening to anyone else.

54:51.088 --> 54:54.256
So I spent years
tracking him,

54:54.258 --> 54:57.426
following him
from town to town.

54:57.428 --> 54:59.561
When I read that story

54:59.563 --> 55:01.864
about the kid Javier
and his brother,

55:01.866 --> 55:04.566
I knew.

55:04.568 --> 55:08.604
Someone here in this town
had summoned him.

55:10.274 --> 55:14.043
So I found a place for rent
and waited.

55:15.046 --> 55:17.846
Okay.

55:17.848 --> 55:19.982
Okay, let's just say
that I believe you.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.952
- Where would he take her?
- Rebecca!

55:25.289 --> 55:27.189
- Please.
- You wanna save your daughter?

55:27.191 --> 55:29.291
Find the Cucuy's cave
before it's too late.

55:29.293 --> 55:31.026
- You're done here.
- Why would he go after her?

55:31.028 --> 55:33.028
She's never hurt anyone
in her whole life.

55:33.030 --> 55:35.397
I said out!
Now. Now!

55:37.134 --> 55:39.168
Stay away from my family.

56:41.132 --> 56:48.170
Funny, after all those years
chasing you,

56:48.172 --> 56:51.206
I was wondering when
you'd decide you had enough.

56:57.148 --> 57:00.649
You can't run from me forever,
can you?

57:02.219 --> 57:04.420
You son of a bitch!

57:09.360 --> 57:11.860
You might silence me,

57:11.862 --> 57:15.864
but someday, somehow,

57:15.866 --> 57:19.168
you will lose.

57:25.209 --> 57:26.642
No fingerprints or DNA

57:26.644 --> 57:28.043
tie him to any
of our crime scenes.

57:28.045 --> 57:30.579
Well, maybe he's not our guy.

57:30.581 --> 57:32.314
Then how do you
explain the pictures,

57:32.316 --> 57:35.684
the articles,
the maps in his basement?

57:35.686 --> 57:38.220
What about this
Latin boogeyman character,

57:38.222 --> 57:40.088
the, um...

57:40.090 --> 57:41.657
Cuckooky?

57:41.659 --> 57:44.159
I've got four grieving
families out there,

57:44.161 --> 57:46.028
desperately searching
for their kids.

57:46.030 --> 57:49.531
I'm not gonna start indulging
in some cultural fairy tale.

57:59.410 --> 58:01.710
Get a team in here immediately.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.112
Do it!

58:05.249 --> 58:06.482
I need backup.

58:34.912 --> 58:39.281
Do you remember anything
about the Cucuy

58:39.283 --> 58:41.783
from when you were little?

58:41.785 --> 58:44.319
Sure.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.688
There were some silly things
that my mother used to tell me

58:46.690 --> 58:48.857
about a...

58:48.859 --> 58:50.292
If you didn't do
what you were told,

58:50.294 --> 58:55.130
the Cucuy would take you
to his cave and eat you.

58:55.132 --> 58:58.367
That's a perfectly normal thing
to tell a little girl, huh?

59:02.306 --> 59:07.142
Is that why you never
told us the stories?

59:07.144 --> 59:09.011
Yeah.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.013
I mean, come on,
isn't life cruel enough

59:11.015 --> 59:13.649
without the addition
of monsters?

59:14.952 --> 59:16.952
But...

59:16.954 --> 59:21.056
- But its part of our heritage.
- Sofie...

59:21.058 --> 59:24.293
Sometimes it's like you're
embarrassed by it or something.

59:24.295 --> 59:26.328
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

59:28.299 --> 59:31.066
I mean, you never
told us the stories,

59:31.068 --> 59:33.535
you never cook Mexican food,

59:33.537 --> 59:36.505
you never speak Spanish.

59:45.849 --> 59:47.416
Look, I just...

59:49.687 --> 59:51.687
I didn't wanna have
to conform

59:51.689 --> 59:55.591
to someone else's
preconceived notions about me.

59:55.593 --> 59:58.560
My entire life, people have
been trying to put me

59:58.562 --> 01:00:01.730
into some kind of a box.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.367
Why?

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:08.203
Because of the color of my skin?

01:00:08.205 --> 01:00:11.573
I don't fit into a box.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:14.242
And your dad didn't.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:18.246
And you and your sister
certainly don't.

01:00:18.248 --> 01:00:21.383
So no, I didn't
put much thought

01:00:21.385 --> 01:00:24.886
into a folk story
that your <i> abuelita</i> told me.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:28.757
But what if
those folk stories

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:32.094
actually had
some truth to them?

01:00:32.096 --> 01:00:33.629
Hmm?

01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:35.697
Now you sound like Boyd.

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:37.399
Why?

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:39.234
What are you saying?

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:41.269
Mom!

01:00:43.607 --> 01:00:50.245
He said if you want
to save Amelia,

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:54.316
find the Cucuy's cave
before it's too late.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:33.321
Is anyone there?

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:46.762
Find the Cucuy's cave.

01:02:48.699 --> 01:02:52.000
I know you were looking, Boyd.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.669
Where is his cave?

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:57.239
Where is he taking
the children?

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:12.888
It can't be that simple.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:30.105
<i>Hey, what's going on?</i>

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.307
I think I figured out
where he's taking them.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:36.044
<i>But in order to find it,</i>

01:03:36.046 --> 01:03:38.713
I'm gonna need to find him.

01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:40.882
<i>And how are you
planning on doing that?</i>

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:43.552
<i>Someone had to have summoned
him in the first place, right?</i>

01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:44.753
I mean--

01:03:46.723 --> 01:03:49.457
- Amelia's a good kid, right?
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:53.395
There's gotta be a reason
he took her and not me.

01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:54.763
<i>But here's what I don't get.</i>

01:03:54.765 --> 01:03:56.398
<i>What could a video geek,</i>

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.068
<i>the most popular girl
in school, a bully,</i>

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.404
<i>and my sister
possibly have in common?</i>

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:04.639
<i>They...</i>

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:06.408
<i>use Facebook.</i>

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.410
<i>Murphy, I'm serious.</i>

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.679
<i>Wait a second.</i>

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.782
Social media.

01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:15.283
<i>Hey, it's all the rage.</i>

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.018
You should try it sometime.

01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.286
<i>No, no.</i>

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.857
I think you might be
on to something.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:24.926
A few days ago,

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:29.331
I found out Sierra
had been bullying her online.

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.633
What if...

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:34.769
What if the others
are connected too?

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:38.373
But what are we looking for?

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.508
I have no idea.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.913
Puppies, panda bears...

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.684
Not really much
of a smoking gun, is it?

01:04:49.686 --> 01:04:52.320
There has to be something.

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:53.955
Wait.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.857
That one.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:00.495
Isn't that...

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.969
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:09.838
<i>I know I'm not perfect,</i>

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.874
<i>but it feels like
no matter what I do,</i>

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:16.845
<i>how hard I try,
how hard I work,</i>

01:05:16.847 --> 01:05:18.747
<i>I'm just not good enough.</i>

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.248
<i>Not for my parents,</i>

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.351
<i>not for my teachers,</i>

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.387
<i>not for the other kids.</i>

01:05:28.225 --> 01:05:30.892
<i>And I just can't do it anymore.</i>

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.533
Javier,

01:05:38.535 --> 01:05:40.168
Sierra, Travis,

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:41.937
they're all here.

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.539
They actually said
those things?

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.344
You gotta go talk
to her parents.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:51.279
Do they still have
that place in town?

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.948
Wait, why do I have to go?

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.283
I'm on a leash.

01:05:57.854 --> 01:05:59.788
Let me take a look at that.

01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:14.703
Whoa.

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.639
Super vintage.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.841
Check this out.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:26.948
Doesn't have anything good
though.

01:06:29.086 --> 01:06:30.485
Hi.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:32.053
You scared me.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:34.723
Can I help you?

01:06:34.725 --> 01:06:36.925
Yeah, um...

01:06:36.927 --> 01:06:40.628
Actually, I was hoping
to ask you a few questions.

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.797
You're Amelia Martin's sister.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.466
You have our condolences.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.801
What can we do for you,
Miss Martin?

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:50.638
Look, I know what's happening.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.974
I know you had something
to do with it.

01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.976
What are you talking about?

01:06:54.978 --> 01:06:57.112
The missing children.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:07:00.849
Javier, Sierra,
Travis, my sister.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.851
I understand the pain
that you and your family

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.419
must be going through,

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:05.653
but I really don't think
this is the place--

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:06.654
I'm talking about the Cucuy!

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:08.523
I'm confused.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.991
I thought
they arrested a suspect,

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.192
the one who killed himself.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:14.996
He was trying to stop him.

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:20.135
Everybody who's been taken
watched your daughter online.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:25.840
Do you expect me to believe
that's just a coincidence?

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:27.475
Hmm?

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.778
Please, I just...

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:34.816
I think there might be
a chance to save those kids.

01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:37.585
But in order to do that...

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:44.359
I need to know
how to summon him.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:45.693
Please.

01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:47.729
We didn't do anything.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.301
Renate, you don't
know anything about

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:56.304
what happened with
those children, do you?

01:07:56.306 --> 01:08:00.375
A few weeks
after we lost Teresa, I...

01:08:00.377 --> 01:08:03.545
I started hearing rumors.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:06.815
And then one day,
somebody sent me a video.

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:09.017
They recorded it
off the Internet.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:11.386
All those kids,

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.521
they could've done something.

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.523
They could've
called the cops.

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:19.027
They could've tried
to talk her out of it.

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:21.328
But they made of fun of her.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:23.198
They cheered her on.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.033
So you cursed them?
The ones that watched the video?

01:08:26.036 --> 01:08:28.502
Did they really deserve
to go on with their lives

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:31.072
while our precious daughter
was buried in the ground?

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:34.341
So yes, I asked the Cucoy
to take anyone,

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.578
whoever watches that video.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:37.745
Jesus.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:41.416
It was just a story.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:44.452
I didn't want
any of them to die.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.421
Can you save them?

01:08:47.424 --> 01:08:49.524
Yeah.

01:08:49.526 --> 01:08:53.228
Do you still have
that copy of the video?

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.232
We need to find
someplace private.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:59.234
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.669
Yeah, I have
just the place.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.274
This is Walsh.
Can you get me the chief?

01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:08.109
<i>Copy that, Walsh.</i>

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:10.111
Tell him it's about his niece.

01:09:10.113 --> 01:09:11.746
<i>Stand by.</i>

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:22.290
Kieran, tell me
that you have something.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.125
<i>- Where is she?</i>
- Who?

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:25.792
<i>Sofia.</i>

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:28.930
She's down the hall with
the boy from across the street.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.798
Do me a favor and go check.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:33.935
Okay.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.841
Sofie, your uncle's
on the phone.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.644
Hey.

01:10:51.181 --> 01:10:54.382
You're gonna find your sister.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.169
All right.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.413
You don't have to watch this.

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:29.884
Well...

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:31.919
can't turn back now.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.232
<i>I'm so alone.</i>

01:11:44.234 --> 01:11:46.167
<i>I know I'm not perfect,</i>

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:49.203
<i>but it feels like
no matter what I do,</i>

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:53.007
<i>how hard I try,
how hard I work,</i>

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.909
<i>I'm just not good enough,</i>

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:57.045
<i>and I just can't
do it anymore.</i>

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.351
<i>Oh, my God. She stepped
in front of the car.</i>

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:04.886
<i>Call 911!</i>

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.357
I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.485
He's here.

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:10.151
I know you're here.

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:15.490
I'm not afraid of you!

01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:28.836
Do you hear me?

01:13:30.607 --> 01:13:33.975
I'm not afraid of you!

01:13:59.002 --> 01:14:00.535
Hey.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.684
<i>Malo.</i>

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:20.688
Now, Sofie.

01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:25.460
I'll see you
on the other side,<i> pendejo.</i>

01:15:12.642 --> 01:15:14.008
Amelia?

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:18.279
Are you down here?

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:51.279
Come on, come on, come on,
come on. Come on!

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:55.950
<i>Hi. You've reached Sofia.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:58.886
Hey, it's me.
Just please call me, okay?

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.794
Sierra?

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:17.198
Amelia, no.
No, no, no, no.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.200
Amelia, Amelia, no, no, no.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:23.037
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:17:23.039 --> 01:17:25.606
Amelia, please wake up.
Please wake up.

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:39.820
Please wake up, Amelia.
Please wake up.

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:45.326
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:52.833
Sofie.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.805
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:17:57.807 --> 01:17:58.939
Shh.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.438
I'll piece a trail out, okay?

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:51.125
Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:18:54.997 --> 01:18:56.097
out of here, okay?

01:18:56.099 --> 01:18:58.399
What about you?

01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:00.101
I can't leave them behind.

01:19:00.103 --> 01:19:02.970
When you get to the top,
pull the rope up, okay?

01:19:02.972 --> 01:19:05.072
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Amelia, listen to me.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.475
I'll tell you
when to lower it, okay?

01:19:07.477 --> 01:19:10.144
Go. Now. Come on!

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.613
Leave my daughter alone!

01:20:58.221 --> 01:20:59.620
It's real.

01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:20.941
This is for Javier.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:26.914
This is for Sierra.

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:31.452
This is for Travis.

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:41.829
And this...

01:21:41.831 --> 01:21:44.198
is for my sister.

01:22:56.205 --> 01:22:57.738
We'd better go.

01:22:58.741 --> 01:23:00.374
Come on.

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:03.410
Come on!

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:05.045
This way, come on.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.086
Okay.

01:23:12.088 --> 01:23:14.088
- You go.
- You go.

01:23:19.662 --> 01:23:21.862
Go, go. I'll see you there.

01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:55.322
I am so glad
you girls are okay.

01:24:55.324 --> 01:24:58.492
Hey, listen, I'm gonna
take time off work.

01:24:58.494 --> 01:25:01.495
I wanna be home more
with my girls, okay?

01:25:02.832 --> 01:25:04.331
Kieran.
