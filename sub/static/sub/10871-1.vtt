WEBVTT

02:23.227 --> 02:25.061
We lost the target.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.647
What do you mean,
you lost the target?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.566
Come on, boys.
Check your stats.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.847
Which arrays are you looking at?

02:32.278 --> 02:33.737
I think it's in
our baffles, sir.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.089
What was that?

02:53.090 --> 02:54.383
Something in the propulsor, sir.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.177
Maneuvering confirms.
Something just hit the propulsor.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.846
They can't answer any bells.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.247
Officer of the Deck, sound general
quarters. Battle stations.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.059
General quarters!

03:05.060 --> 03:06.561
Battle stations,
battle stations!

03:06.562 --> 03:07.854
Helmsman, bring the
pump jets online.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.189
Aye, aye, pump jets
online, Captain.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.943
All right, bring us about.
Let's find out what the hell just hit us.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.627
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly.
Sonar, let's go active.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.337
Petty Officer Schneider,
give me one ping.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.380
One ping, sir.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.265
Officer of the Deck,
flood tubes one and two.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.225
Flood tubes one and two.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.506
Aye, flooding tubes one and two.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.354
Sir, we have contact.

03:49.355 --> 03:52.023
Sierra One bearing
zero-two-zero-zero.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.443
That's it.
Officer of the Deck, target Sierra One.

03:54.444 --> 03:55.444
Aye, aye, sir.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.406
What is that? Enemy sub?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.159
It is way too small
for that, sir.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.129
It's coming right at us, sir.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.339
Fire torpedoes.

04:16.341 --> 04:17.632
Sonar, I need targeting.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.425
Come on, boys.
It's moving too fast.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.303
Take your best guess and fire!

04:21.303 --> 04:22.304
Aye, aye, sir.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.020
We have contact.
Starboard side.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.251
Emergency blow!
Plane, full up, angle!

05:15.691 --> 05:17.901
Rescue efforts have
been coordinated, sir,

05:19.445 --> 05:20.571
but it's not looking good.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.786
The Orca was my
first command, Captain.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.543
What's the bearing
of the target?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.298
Bearing zero-seven-niner, sir.

05:40.424 --> 05:41.633
Seattle.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.262
Starbucks, Space Needle,

05:46.764 --> 05:48.599
hipsters, Microsoft,

05:49.391 --> 05:50.767
Nirvana.

05:50.768 --> 05:51.768
Sir?

05:59.777 --> 06:01.111
We'll make our stand in Seattle.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.772
Honey, do you want some pancakes?
I'm making pancakes.

06:37.773 --> 06:41.108
No, I'm just gonna grab a coffee.
The guys are outside already.

06:41.109 --> 06:44.320
They want me to go to a stand-up
in Bellevue on the snowstorm.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.655
Like they have never seen
snow in Seattle before.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.448
Of course, you don't mind...

06:47.449 --> 06:49.283
That's what I'm
talking about, honey.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.621
Snow in Seattle, I mean, that is
some serious anchor material.

06:52.622 --> 06:54.372
Right, Melody?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.613
I hope they're thinking
that way, but I'm not sure, Rick.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.587
Melody, can you put that
down for half a second?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.464
Melody, hello. Hello.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.508
What? Oh, sorry.

07:04.509 --> 07:05.716
Do you want some breakfast?

07:05.717 --> 07:07.593
Yeah. You always
overdo the bacon.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.555
I do not.

07:10.556 --> 07:12.766
Twenty minutes, 400 degrees.
I make perfect bacon.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.020
Yes, you do make
the perfect bacon.

07:22.652 --> 07:23.652
Hello.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.779
Hello. Melody.

07:27.657 --> 07:29.491
Melody, hello.

07:29.492 --> 07:32.159
Sorry. God!

07:32.160 --> 07:33.320
What are you even looking at?

07:38.792 --> 07:41.043
It's so fake.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.837
Why do you waste your time
watching this nonsense?

07:42.838 --> 07:44.881
I'm not, Mom.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.008
Alicia just DM'd me
'cause it's right near here.

07:47.009 --> 07:50.011
Oh, we'd better look out for a
giant airplane-eating shark, huh?

07:50.012 --> 07:51.555
That's not what I said.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.475
Come on, you can't
take everything you see

07:56.476 --> 07:58.477
on the Internet seriously.
You know that.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.897
No, really, Mom?

08:01.649 --> 08:04.025
That's why we have the
news, and your mother,

08:04.026 --> 08:06.027
guardian of truth and democracy.

08:06.028 --> 08:09.906
Yeah, right. Covering snow
doesn't make me Barbara Walters.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.825
Mmm, Christiane Amanpour
is more my type.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.077
Good luck, Mom!
Go for it!

08:15.078 --> 08:16.454
Thanks.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.205
Give them hell, honey.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.373
Eat up! We're
leaving in five.

08:19.374 --> 08:20.417
Yeah, okay.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.838
How's it going, guys?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.716
Good, good.
Louie got breakfast.

08:27.717 --> 08:28.717
Nice!

08:33.679 --> 08:35.932
My turn tomorrow though, right?
Right.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.477
Trust Trish, the best Channel
55 news anchor we got.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.727
Don't jinx it.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.732
Last I checked, we were doing a
weather stand-up in Bellevue.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.525
Or we could go rogue, find a
cool story and blow Dan away.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.069
Yeah, remember last time?

08:48.070 --> 08:49.570
Yeah.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.906
We all thought the mayor's brother-in-law
was shaking down a strip club.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.617
You thought that.

08:53.618 --> 08:54.825
Yeah, and he wasn't.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.579
Guys, I don't want to get a bad
reputation for being trouble.

08:58.580 --> 09:02.541
I just want Dan to feel like I'm
reliable and not a loose cannon.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.544
Let's just nail the snow job.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.048
And that's how you get promoted, son.
Don't rock the boat.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.718
Or we could go cover the viral
video "Shark Eats Plane."

09:12.719 --> 09:14.553
Hey? It's amazing.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.888
The shark comes
out of the water,

09:15.889 --> 09:18.642
grabs the plane, plunges
it down to the depths.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.726
It looks real.
The animators did a good job.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.436
Yeah, Melody showed
me that this morning.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.563
And that is exactly everything
that's wrong with the news today.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.607
It's, like, totally fake
and ridiculous.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.485
Maybe debunking it
could be a story.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.579
Hey, check that out.
What's going on over there?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.665
Whoa.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.167
That's a lot of firepower.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.628
Yeah, maybe they're
bringing in the big guns

09:46.629 --> 09:48.212
for the snow problems.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.672
I'm sure it's just an exercise.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.383
You're calling Dan?

09:52.384 --> 09:53.844
Yeah, I am.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.473
Hey, Dan, it's Trish.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.684
Yeah, good. You?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.688
Yeah, good.
Listen, I wanna run a story by you.

10:04.689 --> 10:05.814
Five.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.651
No, of course.
But I just...

10:10.652 --> 10:13.155
Have you heard of any naval
exercises going on in the Sound?

10:16.366 --> 10:17.659
Ah.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.660
Yes, sir.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.705
You can count on me.
Okay, bye.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.165
He's totally into it.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.542
No, he said everyone's
talking about the snow,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.544
and we need to get to Bellevue
and talk about the snow.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.838
What did he really say?

10:29.839 --> 10:31.130
Two words, "strip club."

10:31.131 --> 10:33.299
Come on!
One time, one time.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.720
Okay, forget what Dan said.
What would Melody say?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.098
- Let's do it.
- Yeah!

11:18.303 --> 11:19.887
Hey, Maria. How's it going?
Nice to see you, boss.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.514
Jack, yo.
Hey, Rick.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.599
Morning, Phil.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.935
Good night, brother.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.521
What's the deal with the outflow
breach indicator on S14?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.439
It's now your problem.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.775
Good luck.
Thanks, Phil.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.610
Dispatch.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.446
Dispatch.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.866
Hello?

11:39.867 --> 11:40.867
Come on, guys.
Dispatch.

11:44.996 --> 11:47.832
Okay, let's park this
beast right about here,

11:47.833 --> 11:50.710
right across the street
from the best coffee in town.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.963
In your humble opinion.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.589
It's in all in the grind, man.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.800
Can we please not have another

11:56.801 --> 11:58.968
what's-the-best-coffee-
in-Seattle conversation?

11:58.969 --> 12:00.637
What do you think they're doing?

12:04.934 --> 12:06.934
Oh, we should get it.
You know, get something on camera.

12:06.935 --> 12:08.686
Yeah, let's do it.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.687
Man, come on!

12:26.746 --> 12:29.331
Oh, it's Dan.
Is this guy psychic, or what?

12:29.332 --> 12:31.083
It's a company phone.
He's probably tracking it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.293
Seriously?

12:32.294 --> 12:33.753
Yeah, Big Brother, girl.

12:36.841 --> 12:37.841
Hi, Dan.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.427
No, we just saw...

12:41.428 --> 12:43.668
No, wait, listen.
I think I could be onto something here.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.682
No, just listen.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.686
Why do you think a whole lot of U.S.
Navy have just shown up in Seattle?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.022
Well...

12:53.023 --> 12:55.232
No, there's been
no report on it.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.713
That's why you haven't
heard about it.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.429
Don't you think
we should find out?

13:02.991 --> 13:04.825
About the shark.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.666
You know, it could be something to do
with the whole mutant shark thing.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.663
Shit!

13:11.499 --> 13:13.667
Mutant shark.

13:13.668 --> 13:18.506
You know, the video, it's gone viral.
The "Shark Eats Plane."

13:20.843 --> 13:21.843
Dan?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.803
Dan, hello?

13:24.804 --> 13:25.847
Thanks, guys.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.226
He just hung up on me.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.498
Why did you make me
say "mutant shark"?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.065
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good word for it.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.026
Yeah, you should've
used like "killer shark,"

13:38.027 --> 13:39.818
or "great white,"
not "mutant."

13:39.819 --> 13:42.139
Yeah, it's starting to sound
like one of those Syfy movies.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.325
Anyway, coffee's on me.

14:23.446 --> 14:26.116
Junction T41?
What the hell?

14:27.450 --> 14:29.743
Dispatch, get somebody
out to T41.

14:29.744 --> 14:30.744
You got it.

14:33.873 --> 14:34.958
T41?

14:36.334 --> 14:38.211
A complete overhaul
of junction T41 last year.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.423
Dispatch.
Yeah, it's Rick here.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.426
Get someone over to
junction T41 straight away.

14:48.888 --> 14:52.976
Hey. Triple venti half-sweet
nonfat caramel macchiato.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.893
Yeah, okay.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.690
Hey. It's my favorite.

14:59.691 --> 15:00.983
What are you drinking?

15:00.984 --> 15:02.276
A cinnamon latte.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.402
Nice.
Yeah.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.036
Hey, honey.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.871
Hey, Rick.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.665
I think I just did
something really stupid.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.710
They're never gonna
give me this anchor spot.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.670
What? What happened?

15:21.671 --> 15:24.049
I just pitched a mutant
shark story to Dan.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.547
You know, 'cause of that video
Melody was looking at.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.428
Mutant shark?

15:30.472 --> 15:32.222
Honey, wasn't that
on Syfy last week?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.641
Yeah, exactly.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.896
Uh, sorry, Trish.

15:38.897 --> 15:40.939
This is my chance.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.442
It's make or break.
It's my story.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.361
You know, I'm 38,

15:45.362 --> 15:47.613
destined to be the weather
girl until I'm 40,

15:47.614 --> 15:50.908
when they replace me
with some young, hot thing.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.451
Dan doesn't take me
seriously, you know.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.870
He doesn't even listen to me.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.123
Are you listening?

15:57.124 --> 15:58.124
Rick?

15:58.375 --> 16:01.168
Rick? Rick?

16:01.169 --> 16:04.005
Hello. Rick,
are you listening?

16:04.006 --> 16:07.008
Uh, sorry, honey, it's just that
we've got outages and alerts

16:07.009 --> 16:10.053
all over the Magnolia area
like I've never seen.

16:10.054 --> 16:12.013
Magnolia?

16:12.014 --> 16:15.182
We're in Discovery Park.
The place is crawling with Navy.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.434
You think there
could be a connection?

16:17.435 --> 16:20.230
Uh, yeah, maybe if we
declared war on Seattle.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.898
Stop it, I'm serious.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.150
Uh, honey, it's just
the snow and the ice.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.444
The pipes are probably
frozen, okay?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.154
Our system isn't
designed to handle this.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.996
Uh, honey, I gotta go.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.249
Dispatch, talk to me.

16:42.086 --> 16:43.253
Fine.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.759
Oh, my God!

17:03.064 --> 17:04.273
Oh, my God!

17:09.113 --> 17:10.195
Oh, my gosh!

17:11.573 --> 17:13.074
It's the plane from the video.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.358
It's the plane from the video!

17:17.036 --> 17:18.036
You guys...

17:26.255 --> 17:27.753
Oh, my God!

17:27.755 --> 17:30.048
Whoa!

17:30.049 --> 17:32.469
GoPro video of the week. I got it.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.027
Whoa!

18:11.133 --> 18:12.300
Cool.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.015
Come on, upload. Upload.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.678
Come on, dude.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.558
Whoa, whoa. What happened
to the biker dude?

19:06.854 --> 19:07.854
I'm fine.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.732
Stop with the oxygen.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.597
Louie, you all right?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.640
Hey, yeah, I'm okay.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.183
How about you?
You should go see a hospital.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.936
No, they checked me
out already. I'm fine.

19:47.937 --> 19:48.937
You sure?

19:50.481 --> 19:51.899
Oh, my God!

19:55.320 --> 19:57.529
Hey, Erik, come on inside, okay?
Let's walk and talk.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.240
Trish...

19:59.241 --> 20:00.324
We'll just take
a beat outside...

20:00.325 --> 20:02.285
Trish, we've been
reassigned to Veronica.

20:03.328 --> 20:04.703
I'm sorry.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.622
Come over here
and give me a hand.

20:05.623 --> 20:08.332
Trish, what happened?

20:08.333 --> 20:10.626
You look like you
got hit by a truck.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.129
I'm fine, okay?
I was here.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.464
This is my story.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.177
Oh, really? Dan said that you
were covering snow in Bellevue.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.140
Erik, Louie, we're on in five!
Let's roll.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.434
Three, two.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.895
Thanks, John.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.273
Just moments ago, my team and I
were involved in an explosion,

20:33.274 --> 20:36.485
which killed at least five
and left several injured.

20:36.486 --> 20:42.325
But we survived to bring you this
story live from Discovery Park.

20:42.326 --> 20:46.370
Now hold on.
I do believe that this is the fire chief.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.956
Let's see if we can get him
to make a statement.

20:49.957 --> 20:54.378
So, Chief, with your
years of expertise,

20:54.379 --> 20:57.255
can you tell my audience
what happened here?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.467
Uh, yeah, sure, Veronica.

20:59.468 --> 21:00.759
From what we can tell,

21:00.760 --> 21:02.052
we're dealing
with a gas explosion.

21:02.053 --> 21:03.845
Mmm-hmm.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.723
Emergency units responded, and
the situation is now contained.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.226
But sadly, there are five dead and
more than a dozen seriously injured.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.603
No, Chief, I was there.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.939
Something came out of the floor.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.649
Something big came
up out of the floor.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.859
Yeah, it's called gas.

21:17.860 --> 21:22.906
No. No, something came up out of the
floor and destroyed the coffee shop.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.241
Something came out of the floor?

21:24.242 --> 21:26.535
Look, I'm sorry, but I
didn't get your name.

21:26.536 --> 21:29.622
Trish Lanson, Channel 55 News.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.249
Like I said, I was there,

21:32.250 --> 21:34.418
and something came up out of the floor.
Something big.

21:34.419 --> 21:36.003
Hold on. Wait a minute.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.172
Trish Lanson.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.384
You're the wacky weather girl.

21:41.385 --> 21:44.302
This is Trish Lanson
reporting for Channel 55 News.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.303
Ahhh!

21:50.184 --> 21:52.394
Look, Ms. Lanson, why don't you just
leave this to the professionals

21:52.395 --> 21:54.522
and focus a little more on, say,

21:56.400 --> 21:57.400
the weather?

21:59.486 --> 22:04.197
Chief, what causes a gas
explosion such as this one?

22:04.198 --> 22:05.616
Any number of things...

22:15.877 --> 22:17.628
Hello?
Hi, Rick.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.339
Trish, are you okay?
I think so.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
I saw you on the news,
you look terrible. Sorry.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.053
Gee, thanks. Hold on.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.892
Dan's calling.
I think he's gonna fire me.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.685
Don't worry about that.
Listen, Trish,

22:33.686 --> 22:36.354
you said you saw
something in the sewer?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.940
Yeah, look,
I know it sounds crazy.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.358
Trish, listen to me.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.486
Something is in the sewer system,
and it's not frozen pipes.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.488
I know.

22:44.573 --> 22:45.739
I think I saw it.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.158
I got water outages
pointing in a straight line

22:48.159 --> 22:50.786
to Westpoint Treatment Plant,
like something huge is...

22:50.787 --> 22:53.038
Westpoint.
Okay, I gotta go.
Okay, bye.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.583
No, Trish, wait a second.
No, wait.

22:59.504 --> 23:00.296
I gotta go check in with Trish.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.296
Okay.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.052
Hey, where are you going?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.554
I know where the next
accident is gonna be.

23:08.555 --> 23:09.889
Sweet, dude, let's roll.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.646
Hey! Where the hell
do you think you're going?

23:17.647 --> 23:18.647
We're still live.

23:21.651 --> 23:24.737
A tragedy of
monumental proportions.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.084
So, did you just steal
the Channel 55 news van?

23:39.085 --> 23:41.211
Stealing? Louie,
we have a story to chase.

23:41.212 --> 23:42.892
Besides, do I look
like a car thief to you?

23:43.507 --> 23:44.507
Yeah, kind of.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.525
Malone.

24:02.526 --> 24:03.942
Uh, this is Rick at SPU.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.653
You guys got any trouble
in your flow system?

24:05.654 --> 24:07.195
What kind of trouble?

24:07.196 --> 24:10.031
I got reds all down the line
coming right at you.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.409
I don't know what it is.
Something in the pipes.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.702
It's something big.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.580
Rick, this is a
sewage treatment facility,

24:16.581 --> 24:18.666
and there are a lot of
big things in the pipe.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.211
I'm serious, Malone.
It's right on you.

24:25.507 --> 24:26.716
Bureaucratic joker.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.971
Hello?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.153
Roger.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.741
Are you seeing
any back pressure?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.618
Back pressure?

24:54.619 --> 24:58.998
Yeah, there's quite a bit of back
pressure in the bio-solids tank.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.584
You mean the poop tank.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.920
Yeah, I mean the poop tank.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.923
Yeah, there's back pressure, all right.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.090
Why?

25:10.760 --> 25:12.260
Can you flush it?

25:12.261 --> 25:15.680
Yeah, I tried,
but it won't flush.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.901
Run! Everybody, run!

25:27.902 --> 25:29.153
Roger, get out of there!

25:54.720 --> 25:57.056
Roger. Roger,
are you all right?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.129
Oh, my God!

26:29.130 --> 26:30.130
I could have been killed.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.259
Oh, God, the smell!

26:34.260 --> 26:36.344
It's horrible.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.180
Obviously too
late to warn anyone.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.391
Let's get ready to go live.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.102
Oh!

26:48.441 --> 26:49.441
Dan.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.903
Hello, Dan? Hey.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.364
No, wait.

26:56.490 --> 26:57.490
No.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.577
No, I'm here.
I'm at the plant.

27:01.662 --> 27:02.705
Seriously?

27:03.539 --> 27:04.664
Seriously?

27:04.665 --> 27:05.790
I can't believe this.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.417
What?

27:07.418 --> 27:08.752
He doesn't want me to go on air

27:08.753 --> 27:10.128
after that stunt,
as he called it.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.297
"Wait for Veronica."

27:11.839 --> 27:12.923
Are you kidding me?

27:15.259 --> 27:16.259
Shit!

27:17.178 --> 27:18.679
That's my van, Trish.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.388
Sorry.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.231
Right, okay.
Melody? Now what?

27:30.691 --> 27:32.193
This is Veronica Viola.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.159
Louie.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.870
Louie, look at this.
This is what I saw.

27:46.582 --> 27:47.582
Come on,
upload. Upload.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.758
That's a shark robot.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.676
They're calling it Roboshark.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.180
Yeah, I've seen RoboCop.
I remember Robocroc.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.101
Roboshark? I like that.
It has a good ring to it.

28:08.855 --> 28:09.938
God, no!

28:09.939 --> 28:10.773
What do you want to do now?

28:10.774 --> 28:11.981
Hold on.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.651
No, you're not coming.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.241
Oh, my God, you idiot!

28:21.242 --> 28:23.409
We've got a level-one
contamination out here.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.912
Get that isolation tank now!

28:24.913 --> 28:27.123
No, I don't want this on camera.
Turn it off! Help me!

28:27.873 --> 28:29.624
Let's get out of here.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.834
Okay, where to?

28:30.835 --> 28:32.710
What is it?
It smells awful.
Calm down, ma'am.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.380
Argh! I can feel it
on me. It's disgusting.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.134
What?
That's not good enough.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.094
Do you understand
the situation we're in?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.720
What? Well,
I need more, okay?

28:43.889 --> 28:45.431
See what you can
get from Tacoma,

28:45.432 --> 28:46.642
all right?

28:48.018 --> 28:49.018
Talk to me.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.397
I don't know.
Pour concrete on it.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.899
I need you to okay these.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.527
We're gonna need some
serious contractors.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.196
Hang on.

29:00.489 --> 29:03.283
Oh, thank God
you're okay, Trish!

29:03.284 --> 29:05.326
Look, I can't talk right now.
It is crazy in here.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.745
Hey, listen, I need to know
where it's headed next.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.789
No way! Uh-uh.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.542
Look, I've got outages
everywhere,

29:12.543 --> 29:14.335
and you have to stay away from it.
You got that?

29:14.336 --> 29:16.754
No, listen,
you saw it this morning.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.841
It was on the video
that Melody showed us.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.886
They're calling it Roboshark.

29:22.887 --> 29:25.597
"Roboshark"?
What the hell are you talking about?

29:25.598 --> 29:27.473
Stand down.
Rick.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.767
Uh, Trish, something's
going on. I gotta go.

29:29.768 --> 29:30.768
What? Rick!

30:04.094 --> 30:06.494
Get these civilians out of here.
We're setting up right here.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.773
Rick Lanson,
Operations Deputy Director.

30:16.774 --> 30:19.777
Mr. Lanson, Admiral Nathan
Black, United States Navy.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.950
It's come to our attention that
you've been tracking a disturbance

30:26.951 --> 30:27.992
in the city sewer system.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.619
Yeah.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.413
Son, the American
people need you.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.289
For what?

30:33.290 --> 30:34.290
To defend the homeland.

30:36.794 --> 30:37.794
Can we count on you?

30:38.629 --> 30:41.507
Uh... Yeah, totally.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.937
That's it. End of the line.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.648
I'm gonna hand her the keys.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.650
What? No, we have to
finish the story.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.944
No, it's over, Louie.
It's been fun.

31:02.945 --> 31:06.864
- God, it stinks!
- What is that smell?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.533
Hey, Mel!

31:08.534 --> 31:11.036
Melody, what are you doing here?

31:11.037 --> 31:12.704
Hey, Louie. Hey, Mom.

31:12.705 --> 31:15.749
Oh, God, it stinks!
Let's get out of here.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.252
What the hell?

31:20.046 --> 31:21.046
How did you get here?

31:22.673 --> 31:24.299
How did you know where I was?

31:24.300 --> 31:27.010
I got you on Phone Tracker.
Can we go now?

31:27.011 --> 31:28.929
Oh, God, she's here.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.013
Yeah, she is.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.180
Okay, so what's the next step?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.598
We take you back to school.

31:35.436 --> 31:36.894
Veronica's got the story.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.313
Besides, we have
no way of knowing

31:38.314 --> 31:39.897
where Roboshark's
gonna hit next.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.817
Mom, this is what I've been telling you.
You need me.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.111
Really? And how are
you gonna help?

31:45.112 --> 31:46.947
Dad's the only
one who can do that

31:46.948 --> 31:48.781
by tracking the water outages
as it travels through the city.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.075
Wait, Dad said it's
messing up the water?

31:51.076 --> 31:53.911
Well, we can search for tweets
about water outages by time stamp

31:53.912 --> 31:54.912
and then map them.

31:55.831 --> 31:56.831
Hold on.

32:01.003 --> 32:04.213
How's this?
Looks like something's
happening at the Pacific Mall.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.341
That's actually pretty good.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.885
Okay, can we go now?
It seriously stinks.

32:08.886 --> 32:09.886
Okay.

32:11.889 --> 32:15.017
Hey! Hey, that's my
news van, damn it!

32:15.018 --> 32:16.810
Listen, we're still live.
That's my news van!

32:18.937 --> 32:21.065
Um...

32:49.093 --> 32:50.386
Run! Run! Run!

33:08.487 --> 33:10.321
Roboshark. This way.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.049
Target's dead ahead.
Fire at will.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.319
Fall back!

34:37.326 --> 34:39.161
Okay, you stay here.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.411
No way, Mom.
That's like the dumbest thing
to do in the movies.

34:41.413 --> 34:44.623
Like, "Oh, yeah, let's leave the
girl in the car to protect her.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.253
"Oh, wait, the monster's going towards
the car! Oh, no, let's save her!"

34:48.254 --> 34:50.295
I'm coming with you and keeping
you from doing anything dumb.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.005
Oh, really?

34:52.007 --> 34:53.800
Besides, it's freezing out here.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.179
Let's go, come on!

34:57.180 --> 34:59.620
Fine, but you stay right next to
me and you do as you're told.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.683
Come on, Louie! Come on!

35:04.478 --> 35:05.562
Louie, go!

35:16.907 --> 35:18.033
Okay, we're going live.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.286
Two.

35:22.204 --> 35:23.663
We are live on the scene

35:23.664 --> 35:25.581
as what has been named Roboshark

35:25.582 --> 35:27.542
has apparently
attacked the Pacific Mall.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.052
I don't think
this is a good idea.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.180
Mom, someone's got
to get the story out.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.681
Only if they survive.

35:41.682 --> 35:43.392
Come on!

35:45.228 --> 35:47.068
If we go around that corner,
we'll have a shot.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.188
- Let's go, come on.
- Come on.

35:49.189 --> 35:50.190
Okay, stay close.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
Get down.
Ow!

36:07.958 --> 36:10.043
Oh, my God!

36:12.170 --> 36:14.297
Mom, did you see that?

36:14.298 --> 36:16.132
I know.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.218
It just ate that man.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.762
Run!

36:22.806 --> 36:24.515
Mom, we've got to
get the word out.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.641
Yeah, Trish, I got it all.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.311
Call the big D.
Right.

36:31.315 --> 36:33.195
You're about to witness
the power of television.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.822
Hello? Hey,
can you put Dan on?

36:40.157 --> 36:42.700
He's not...
Conference call?

36:42.701 --> 36:45.370
This is breaking news.
This is big.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.832
This is the oil spill disaster and the
'89 flood rolled into one huge...

36:50.250 --> 36:51.960
Sure, have him call me back.

36:53.421 --> 36:54.670
He's gonna call me back, so...

36:54.671 --> 36:55.671
Okay, so?

36:57.507 --> 36:59.134
Let's put it online.
Yes!

37:22.908 --> 37:24.242
No, no.

37:27.329 --> 37:28.455
Right there.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.419
Yes, that's good.

38:02.572 --> 38:03.782
Hey, Mom.

38:39.151 --> 38:40.151
Oh, good!

40:00.941 --> 40:03.359
We're at the Pacific Mall.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.111
What?
What are you doing there?
Are you okay?

40:06.112 --> 40:07.614
I've got red lights
all over that place.

40:07.615 --> 40:10.492
We're fine.
I got Melody with me.

40:10.493 --> 40:13.828
Melody? What the hell?
Why isn't she in school?

40:13.829 --> 40:16.789
Rick, there's a giant robot
shark tunneling under the city,

40:16.790 --> 40:18.916
eating everything in its path.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.335
Melody's helping
us get the word out.

40:21.336 --> 40:22.504
She's incredible.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.255
Giant robot shark?

40:24.256 --> 40:25.965
What, did Melody
just use her years

40:25.966 --> 40:28.425
of robot-shark-fighting
experience to save us?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.803
Trish, are you out of
your mind? She's 15!

40:30.804 --> 40:33.347
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

40:33.348 --> 40:36.893
Besides, my Instagram account
has over 11,000 followers.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.396
Melody. So I'm
on speakerphone.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.517
What does your Insta account
have to do with anything?

40:44.526 --> 40:46.528
Okay. Sorry, we're gonna
get cut off here.

40:46.529 --> 40:47.987
Why?

40:47.988 --> 40:49.905
I've got Navy guys here
making me look for the shark.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.491
Roboshark, Dad.
Roboshark.

40:51.492 --> 40:53.325
Roboshark, whatever.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.286
Who are they, Rick?
What can you tell me about what's going on?

40:55.287 --> 40:57.162
I'm sorry, baby.
I can't tell you that.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.164
Dad, have you changed
your password lately?

40:59.165 --> 41:00.165
What? No.

41:00.876 --> 41:02.418
You know my password?

41:02.419 --> 41:03.794
I hung up...

41:03.795 --> 41:05.589
The Admiral will clear
all calls, in or out.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.090
Cool!

41:11.970 --> 41:15.598
The Navy? That sounds like some
kind of top-secret weapon.

41:15.599 --> 41:18.392
They lost control of it,
it's here and it's hungry.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.561
Louie, stop with
the conspiracy theories.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.647
We're supposed to report
the news, not write it.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.064
You're not gonna use that?

41:25.483 --> 41:27.652
What's this about
your dad's password?

41:27.653 --> 41:30.363
Seriously, Mom? Please!
So we can listen in, obviously.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.285
No, I'm sorry.
Admiral!

41:37.538 --> 41:38.538
Excuse me.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.709
That was my wife and kid
I was talking to in there.

41:42.710 --> 41:44.960
They're sort of

41:44.961 --> 41:47.681
in the middle of this thing, and you
can't just cut me off like that.

41:58.684 --> 41:59.643
Rick, right?

41:59.644 --> 42:01.644
Yeah, sir.

42:01.645 --> 42:04.229
You need to understand there's
a lot at stake here, Rick.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.482
Don't test me.

42:06.483 --> 42:09.361
I'm not trying to test you, sir.
It's my wife and kid.

42:11.739 --> 42:12.906
Let's go in your office.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.623
What I'm about to tell you,
you cannot reveal to anyone.

42:21.624 --> 42:25.043
If you do, well,
we'll just have to kill you.

42:31.883 --> 42:32.883
You're serious.

42:35.553 --> 42:36.873
U.S. Navy wouldn't
kill you, Rick.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.640
You're American.

42:39.599 --> 42:41.976
We'll just destroy
your credibility.

42:41.977 --> 42:43.728
IRS would seize all your assets.

42:43.729 --> 42:46.647
And after you lost your job,
your wife, your family,

42:46.648 --> 42:48.483
you'd kill yourself.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.653
This guy's a douche!
Melody!

42:51.654 --> 42:52.903
Sorry, Mom.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.238
Classic douche.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.656
I know, right?

42:55.657 --> 42:58.826
Okay, then maybe you guys
shouldn't tell me anything.

42:58.827 --> 43:00.662
You're already
in, Rick. Deep.

43:01.371 --> 43:02.622
Deep?

43:02.623 --> 43:03.623
Deep.
Deep?

43:04.582 --> 43:05.792
You heard of force majeure?

43:07.919 --> 43:12.006
Well, force majeure, Rick, is when
you get intel that an alien starship...

43:13.591 --> 43:15.217
That's right.

43:15.218 --> 43:19.638
An alien starship has
launched something at us.

43:19.639 --> 43:24.185
And that thing has taken out a
United States nuclear submarine.

43:26.187 --> 43:28.440
One hundred and
sixty-eight men,

43:29.775 --> 43:30.775
gone.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.321
And that's what
we're here to destroy.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.323
Wow.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.324
Are you sure?

43:39.659 --> 43:42.411
Dead sure.

43:42.412 --> 43:45.123
We're the United States Navy.
We don't make mistakes.

43:47.417 --> 43:50.002
We're gonna kick
its alien shark's ass

43:50.003 --> 43:52.046
back to whatever damn
planet it came from.

43:52.047 --> 43:53.048
Sir.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.760
Yes?

43:58.804 --> 43:59.804
Yes, sir.

44:00.764 --> 44:01.764
Yeah...

44:02.974 --> 44:03.974
But, sir, we're quite...

44:06.770 --> 44:08.937
Yes, understood, sir.

44:08.938 --> 44:10.378
Yes, he'll have
our full cooperation.

44:11.733 --> 44:12.817
Yes, sir.

44:13.735 --> 44:15.153
Well, thank you, sir.

44:20.784 --> 44:21.784
When will he be here?

44:22.786 --> 44:23.952
Any second.

44:23.953 --> 44:25.246
Who? Who? Who?
Who? Who was that?

44:31.336 --> 44:33.421
The most powerful
man in the world.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.882
Cool. The President?

44:36.883 --> 44:39.635
No. Someone
with real power.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.595
Oh, please. Enough, XO.

44:41.596 --> 44:42.722
Sorry, Admiral.

44:44.641 --> 44:45.850
Oh...

45:28.936 --> 45:30.812
Hi, I'm Bill. Hi.

45:32.939 --> 45:34.232
Hi, I'm Bill.

45:35.441 --> 45:36.775
Hi, I'm Bill.

45:36.776 --> 45:37.943
I'm Rick, you're Bill.

45:37.944 --> 45:39.028
Yes, I'm Bill.

45:39.821 --> 45:40.989
Nice to meet you.

45:42.699 --> 45:43.740
You're in my office.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.908
Yes, it looks like that, Rick.

45:44.909 --> 45:45.909
It's my office.

45:46.828 --> 45:48.745
Admiral, it's good
to see you, too.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.832
Bill, it's been a while.

45:50.833 --> 45:52.374
2010.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.334
We were trying to sell
the army electric tanks.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.003
Yeah, that didn't go
off too well, did it?

45:56.004 --> 45:58.255
No. Electric tanks,
who would've thought?

45:58.256 --> 45:59.256
Oh, boy.

46:01.342 --> 46:02.902
Well, I have a solution
to our problems.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.888
Alien technology.

46:05.889 --> 46:09.391
Belinda and I feel that we can
solve poverty and diseases...

46:09.392 --> 46:12.311
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
We get it.

46:12.312 --> 46:14.188
You're gonna save the world.

46:14.189 --> 46:16.231
Let's cut to the chase, Bill.

46:16.232 --> 46:19.443
How the hell are you gonna
deal with Roboshark?

46:19.444 --> 46:21.571
Admiral, I'm glad you
asked that question.

46:22.823 --> 46:25.616
How does one communicate
with alien intelligence?

46:25.617 --> 46:27.201
Music and math.

46:31.206 --> 46:32.957
The first thing we do

46:32.958 --> 46:35.125
is we establish a common
communication language.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.878
And then we use this.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.721
The MS-Drone.

46:48.932 --> 46:50.682
We develop a musical rapport.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.894
We work on understanding
its operating system.

46:52.895 --> 46:54.269
We shut it down.

46:54.270 --> 46:55.896
We reverse engineer it.

46:55.897 --> 46:58.273
And then bingo!
We own that market, too.

47:00.068 --> 47:02.152
- That's...
- So, now,

47:02.153 --> 47:03.753
I understand you know
where Roboshark is.

47:04.572 --> 47:05.990
Yes, sir.

47:05.991 --> 47:06.991
Well...

47:08.952 --> 47:11.370
Billionaires,
always screwing around

47:11.371 --> 47:12.955
with a perfectly
good military operation.

47:12.956 --> 47:14.082
I agree, sir.

47:36.980 --> 47:41.817
All right. How much longer is it gonna be?
It's darn cold out here.

47:41.818 --> 47:45.862
I'm gonna tell Belinda that
global warming is an okay thing.

47:45.863 --> 47:50.075
Okay, what if we run those numbers?
Yep. Do it, do it. Excellent.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.911
Okay, guys, look sharp.

47:51.912 --> 47:53.495
Show me that report.
Here you go.

47:53.496 --> 47:54.496
Okay.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.082
Yeah, that's good.
Let's look at the whole...

47:57.083 --> 47:59.043
I want the helos up and ready.

47:59.044 --> 48:02.588
Missiles, Gatling guns,
the whole nine yards.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.090
Yes, sir.

48:06.009 --> 48:07.009
Get me Bill.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.055
Admiral, I just want
to say I appreciate

48:11.056 --> 48:12.472
your cooperation
and your teamwork.

48:12.473 --> 48:13.975
Yeah, of course.

48:13.976 --> 48:15.816
Remember, life's not fair.
Just get used to it.

48:16.728 --> 48:17.812
Self-righteous...

48:19.147 --> 48:20.606
What do you want to do, boss?

48:22.233 --> 48:23.734
Tell them to stand down.

48:23.735 --> 48:24.735
Roger that.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.447
Yes! I found it!

48:27.989 --> 48:30.867
It's at THX1138.

48:32.327 --> 48:34.495
Great, over and out.
We are online.

48:58.519 --> 49:00.188
Okay, baby, come and get me.

49:04.984 --> 49:06.110
What?

49:08.863 --> 49:09.863
What?

49:12.241 --> 49:13.117
Everything all right, Rick?

49:13.118 --> 49:15.243
Uh...

49:15.244 --> 49:17.830
Fine, I just need to
go to the bathroom.

49:19.832 --> 49:20.832
Okay.

49:22.002 --> 49:23.044
So, I'll just, uh...

49:24.046 --> 49:26.130
Excuse me, I'm just...

49:26.131 --> 49:27.382
I'm just gonna...

49:28.800 --> 49:29.800
Going to the bathroom!

49:40.061 --> 49:42.229
Hi, Rick.

49:42.230 --> 49:44.064
Trish, are you
remoting in my desktop

49:44.065 --> 49:45.425
and listening to
our conversations?

49:46.026 --> 49:47.026
I'm not.

49:47.777 --> 49:49.695
Your daughter,
on the other hand, is.

49:51.406 --> 49:54.324
Are you crazy?
Do you wanna be shot for treason?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.243
Don't be dramatic.

49:56.244 --> 49:58.621
No, I'm not being dramatic.
They are being dramatic.

49:59.997 --> 50:01.498
Hang on.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.833
Where are you?
Right now?

50:02.834 --> 50:03.834
What?

50:04.168 --> 50:06.002
Where are...

50:06.003 --> 50:07.254
You're at the park.

50:07.255 --> 50:09.631
It's where the story is, Rick.

50:09.632 --> 50:11.384
God, Trish,
please get out of there.

50:12.135 --> 50:13.927
Are you kidding?

50:13.928 --> 50:17.597
Aliens, Rick, Bill Glates, this
is the biggest story of all time,

50:17.598 --> 50:19.808
and I'm right in
the middle of it.

50:19.809 --> 50:24.062
Oh, this is Roboshark.
Forget the damn anchor job!

50:24.063 --> 50:27.524
This isn't about
the damn anchor job, Rick!

50:27.525 --> 50:30.193
This is about letting the
people know the truth.

50:30.194 --> 50:34.114
What Roboshark is, where it
came from and what it wants.

50:34.115 --> 50:35.283
Trish...

50:37.076 --> 50:40.203
I can feel it coming, Rick.
It's coming.

50:40.204 --> 50:42.122
Trish, get out of there.
Please!

50:42.123 --> 50:43.123
Everything will be okay.

50:44.167 --> 50:45.418
I'll call you later.

50:46.086 --> 50:47.295
Trish! Trish!

50:48.171 --> 50:49.297
Damn it!

50:51.174 --> 50:52.383
Rick, Rick, Rick.

50:54.177 --> 50:55.177
Toilet paper.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.354
Now I think I've
got its attention.

51:26.626 --> 51:27.626
Whoa!

51:35.259 --> 51:36.259
Whoa!

51:59.200 --> 52:00.742
Status?

52:00.743 --> 52:02.619
I'm looking for a signal.
No go so far.

52:02.620 --> 52:04.162
Let's try another run at it.

52:19.346 --> 52:21.266
Let's play a little
closer this time. Here we go.

52:27.311 --> 52:28.311
Come to Daddy.

52:32.192 --> 52:33.792
I'm activating
the communication package.

52:37.196 --> 52:39.364
Let's load the virus.
Here we go.

52:39.365 --> 52:42.201
Three, two, one!

52:53.921 --> 52:56.799
Wow. He's full of stars.

53:21.283 --> 53:23.533
Oh, my God.
It just ate Bill Glates!

53:23.534 --> 53:25.702
It just ate Bill Glates!

53:25.703 --> 53:27.622
I've never shot
anything like this before.

53:28.456 --> 53:31.250
Damn billionaires.

53:31.251 --> 53:33.011
Always poking around
where they don't belong.

53:33.919 --> 53:34.919
Huh?

53:35.338 --> 53:37.005
One fewer, right?

53:37.006 --> 53:38.590
That's right, boss.

53:38.591 --> 53:40.635
I want those helos up.
Fully loaded.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.430
Where did you say it was headed?

53:46.015 --> 53:50.853
Uh, Huntsman High School,
where people shouldn't go.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.272
You all right, son?

53:56.526 --> 53:59.320
It's Melody.

53:59.321 --> 54:01.488
They think the next attack is
gonna be at Huntsman High. Hurry!

54:01.489 --> 54:02.740
Let's go, Louie.

54:04.867 --> 54:07.662
Don't worry.
I'm taking Roboshark out.

54:09.331 --> 54:10.771
After you evacuate
the school, right?

54:11.333 --> 54:12.458
Evacuation?

54:13.292 --> 54:14.335
I wish we could.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.462
Admiral, it's a school.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.923
The burden of command, Rick.

54:19.924 --> 54:23.093
We can't afford to let the enemy
know that we know its plans.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.470
It would take away
the element of surprise.

54:25.471 --> 54:26.971
It's a sacrifice
we'll have to make.

54:26.972 --> 54:28.264
A sacrifice...

54:28.265 --> 54:31.309
They don't hire us to make
the easy choices, Rick.

54:31.310 --> 54:34.689
"The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few."

54:36.273 --> 54:38.192
Wrath of Khan, seriously?

54:38.651 --> 54:40.360
Who?

54:40.361 --> 54:41.987
Come on, how do you
not know that?

54:47.284 --> 54:49.077
250,000 hits in six minutes.

54:49.078 --> 54:50.954
You look great,
Mom, I'm proud of you.

54:50.955 --> 54:52.373
Turn right.

54:56.711 --> 54:58.586
They're not alerting the high school.
What?

54:58.587 --> 54:59.547
We have to tell
them to evacuate.

54:59.548 --> 55:01.382
How are we gonna do that?

55:01.383 --> 55:03.299
Mom, I've got over 100,000
followers 'cause of Roboshark.

55:03.300 --> 55:04.300
Watch this.

55:04.301 --> 55:05.552
Left!

55:19.942 --> 55:22.152
On your mark, get set...

55:56.604 --> 55:58.021
Hey, you gotta go!
Get out of the way!

55:58.022 --> 55:59.564
Roboshark is coming!
Go!

55:59.565 --> 56:01.232
Get out of the way, go!

56:01.233 --> 56:02.233
Get out, get out!

56:10.242 --> 56:11.534
Oh, my God,
that's Trish and Melody!

56:11.535 --> 56:14.496
Not our problem.
Prepare to engage, Chief.

56:14.497 --> 56:16.582
No! That's my wife and kid!
Get him out of here, now!

56:16.583 --> 56:18.416
That's my wife and kid in there!

56:18.417 --> 56:20.043
Engage!

56:20.044 --> 56:21.461
Please!

56:55.913 --> 56:57.456
Get out of the pool!

56:57.457 --> 56:58.706
Everybody get out of here!

56:58.707 --> 57:00.459
Go, go, go!

57:07.466 --> 57:09.552
Quick! Hurry, hurry!

57:14.431 --> 57:15.431
Roboshark is coming!

57:21.272 --> 57:22.272
Go, go!
Get out of here!

57:52.094 --> 57:54.680
This is bad.
This is really bad.

57:54.681 --> 57:56.348
Okay, bad bad or bad good?

58:07.526 --> 58:09.444
Oh, my God!

58:09.445 --> 58:11.696
Melody, put your phone down!
This is not the right time for that!

58:11.697 --> 58:13.615
Roboshark's following me.

58:13.616 --> 58:15.450
What?

58:15.451 --> 58:17.035
She said Roboshark is following her.
Yeah, I heard her.

58:17.036 --> 58:18.796
What do you mean,
Roboshark is following you?

58:23.792 --> 58:25.432
What are you doing?
I just DM'd Roboshark.

58:26.003 --> 58:28.630
What is DMing?
Direct messaging.

58:28.631 --> 58:30.925
What did you say?
Please stop hurting us, cry face.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.099
You called Roboshark a cry face?

58:40.100 --> 58:43.269
No, I just used a cry face sign.
You know, like an emoticon.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.521
Like a colon, a dash,
and a closed parenthesis?

58:45.522 --> 58:47.231
No, that would be a happy face.

58:47.232 --> 58:49.108
Cry face would be
an open parenthesis.

58:49.109 --> 58:50.611
She probably used an emoji, right?
Yeah, duh.

58:50.612 --> 58:52.654
Yeah, good.
An emoji's like a little...

58:52.655 --> 58:54.238
Yeah, I know what emojis are, okay?

58:54.239 --> 58:55.740
Is that Roboshark?
What did he say?

58:55.741 --> 58:56.951
It's emojis.

58:57.743 --> 59:01.788
Rocket ship, fish, cry face.

59:01.789 --> 59:03.332
What is that supposed to mean?

59:05.627 --> 59:06.961
Where's that coming from?

59:10.965 --> 59:13.550
Roboshark is making music.

59:17.554 --> 59:18.721
Melody, where are you going?

59:18.722 --> 59:20.390
I'm fine, Mom.

59:20.391 --> 59:22.517
Melody, are you crazy?
Get back here!

59:22.518 --> 59:24.061
Mom, it's okay.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.400
It's friendly.

59:32.778 --> 59:34.154
It's okay, Roboshark.

59:36.949 --> 59:38.325
No one's gonna hurt you.

59:47.543 --> 59:48.543
Friends.

59:49.837 --> 59:50.963
Oh, my God.

59:53.465 --> 59:54.674
Are you getting this?

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.471
Melody, run!

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.015
This is
the United States military.

01:00:02.016 --> 01:00:03.684
Stand down or you
will be fired upon.

01:00:03.685 --> 01:00:04.685
Melody!

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:18.865
Okay, boys, target's dead ahead!

01:00:18.866 --> 01:00:20.075
Fire at will!
No!

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:22.745
Stop shooting!

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.629
Hold your fire.
Roboshark target is down.
Hold your fire.

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:35.673
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about!

01:00:37.176 --> 01:00:41.805
United States Navy one,
Roboshark, zero. Whoo!

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:43.849
Go on.

01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:03.242
We're gonna give
you a break, son.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:04.643
Looks like
the Roboshark is history.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.942
What about my wife and daughter?

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.252
What?

01:01:14.922 --> 01:01:16.799
They're fine.
Got you!

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.339
What's the matter with you?

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.638
This is not a comedy!

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:25.556
Right?

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:31.020
Is the target destroyed?

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.701
We're gonna have to
send divers to confirm.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.712
On the scene at
Huntsman High in Seattle,

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:59.924
where a swim meet was
interrupted by a violent...

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.429
Mom.

01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.558
It looked at me like...

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:09.475
Like it was smart.

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:15.149
We got it all wrong and they killed it.
Now it's gone.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:16.775
I know.

01:02:17.777 --> 01:02:18.777
It's okay.
I love you, Mom.

01:02:18.778 --> 01:02:19.778
Hey, guys.

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:22.530
What are you doing here?

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:24.574
With my van?

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:27.828
I was getting the first on-camera
communication with Roboshark.

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:30.746
That is until they killed it.
But then, I got that on camera too.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.999
You? You got this
on camera?

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.750
Yeah, how do you like it?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.921
That footage is mine.
I'm the reporter assigned to this story.

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.798
And you were both supposed
to be working for me.

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:42.758
So whatever you shot with
Louie, the footage is mine!

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:43.759
Hey! Look at this.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.637
Yeah, that's right, sister.

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:50.892
896,000 followers.

01:02:50.893 --> 01:02:52.894
You take one more
step towards that camera,

01:02:52.895 --> 01:02:54.729
and I tweet,

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:57.982
"Veronica Viola steals Trish
Lanson's Roboshark footage."

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.193
And I'm just getting started.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:02.069
It gets a lot uglier from there.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.905
That nose job.

01:03:03.906 --> 01:03:06.449
That Botox you've been having.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.368
And what about that lesbian
weekend in Cabo I heard about.

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.689
All right, fine,
keep the footage.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:12.163
Just relax.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.341
Oh, my God.
What?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.468
It's Roboshark!

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.302
It's alive!

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.263
What did it say?
It says...

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.060
"Roboshark phone home."

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.145
Heavy.

01:03:36.355 --> 01:03:37.355
Whoa.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.869
I want confirmation
that that fish is dead.

01:03:51.954 --> 01:03:53.580
You got that?
Yes, sir.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.629
What is it?

01:04:04.216 --> 01:04:06.635
Admiral, it's alive.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:10.721
That's impossible.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.473
It is.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.475
Admiral, you've got to get
those divers out of there.

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.602
Sit down.

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:21.692
The enemy is wounded.
We'll finish the job.
It's what we do.

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:31.326
Admiral, we really need to concentrate
our efforts in this area here.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:23.127
Damn it.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.679
Are you and your family in some
kind of terroristic relationship

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.806
with Roboshark?

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:37.350
What? No!

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:38.602
Talk to me, Rick.

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:42.522
Okay, okay.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.610
I don't know if this means anything,
but for the past few hours,

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.904
Roboshark has been traveling in
pretty much a straight line.

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:51.197
Where does it lead?

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:52.758
I don't know,
somewhere along this line.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.284
The Space Needle?

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:56.620
The Space Needle.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:58.954
Of course.

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:01.749
Chief.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.043
Aye-aye, sir.

01:06:03.044 --> 01:06:05.086
"Of course the Space Needle"?
Why? Why "of course"?

01:06:05.087 --> 01:06:06.587
All right, boys.
Pack it up, we're moving out.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.256
We were expecting
something like this.

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:12.184
An attempt to communicate
with the mothership.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.222
The mothership?

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:18.516
Using the Space Needle?

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:20.317
It needs something large
to act as an antenna.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.437
Space Needle fits the bill.

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.606
We cannot allow that
communication to occur.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:28.068
The enemy must be
stopped at all costs.

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:30.570
You're coming with us.

01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:33.073
Am I?

01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:40.287
Damn!
Rick?

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:43.457
Uh, I got to go to the bathroom.

01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:44.834
Again.

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:45.919
Weak bladder.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.394
Just lost the feed, Mel.
What?

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.148
It's Dad. Hey, Rick.

01:07:07.149 --> 01:07:08.775
Mom, give me that.
You're driving. Dad?

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.819
Put your mom on the phone.

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.530
Mom can't talk right now.
She's driving to the Space Needle.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.032
Besides, it's not safe to talk on the
phone and drive at the same time.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:21.162
Not safe?
Then stay away from the Space Needle!

01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:22.913
The Navy's bringing in
the big guns.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:26.167
Dad, they can't kill Roboshark!

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:28.368
This is the U.S. Navy, honey.
They're gonna get it done.

01:07:29.088 --> 01:07:30.379
Not if we can stop it.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.465
Dad, Roboshark is friendly.

01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:33.508
It's following me.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:35.968
Following you?

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.136
What do you mean,
Roboshark is following you?

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:39.054
Then you need to run!

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.931
Run, Melody, run.

01:07:40.932 --> 01:07:43.767
Not following following,
Twitter following.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.728
Roboshark is
following me on Twitter!

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:47.646
What? What?

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:50.983
Dad, think about it.
What if Roboshark wasn't bad?

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:52.610
What if it just
wanted to be liked

01:07:52.611 --> 01:07:54.153
and see what the Earth was like?

01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:56.572
And then people
started trying to kill it.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.242
Honey, just because someone
friends you on Twitter

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:01.702
does not make them a friend in real life.
Come on!

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.330
Dad, you can't
friend people on Twitter.

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:06.999
I don't know if
Roboshark has Facebook.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.169
Melody, what are you
even talking about?

01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:11.838
This is Roboshark!

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:15.300
Hey, buddy, ready to go?

01:08:31.233 --> 01:08:32.233
Dad?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.234
Dad, are you there?

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.238
Dad?

01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.366
That's weird.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:41.367
It just cut out?

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:43.118
Are you sure about this?

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.955
Yes, Mom. I'm sure.

01:09:21.325 --> 01:09:22.325
Whoa!

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.491
I heard about this new, uh...

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:32.292
Ah! Ow!

01:09:32.294 --> 01:09:35.337
Oh, are you okay?
What was that?

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.965
I want the cruise missiles
warming up in the bullpen.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:40.634
And I want the big guns
ready on the battleship

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.511
to rain hell down on Roboshark!

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:45.932
We're gonna whip his ass!

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:49.852
And call the President.

01:09:49.853 --> 01:09:52.354
I want the green light
for the tactical nukes.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.356
Yes, sir, Admiral.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:55.107
Admiral!

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.860
Admiral!

01:09:57.861 --> 01:10:01.780
You can't use nukes!
It's Seattle!

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.992
Never a big fan
of this city, Rick.

01:10:04.993 --> 01:10:08.079
Not since the Seahawks
embarrassed the Cowboys in 2012.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.247
What?

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:12.292
Got you!

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:48.620
The Roboshark stops here.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:52.247
Clip on. You're coming, too.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.000
But, Admiral, I have no...

01:10:55.293 --> 01:10:58.962
No, no, no, no!

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:03.092
No!

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:05.678
Whoa!

01:11:05.679 --> 01:11:08.515
Okay, I get it.
You're just joking.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:11.016
Nope.

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:13.394
Whoa!

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.417
And now we're livestreaming
with everything we shoot.

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:42.047
Whoa. The power of news van,
the size of my phone. Cool.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:43.966
Come on, we'll have to go the
rest of the journey on foot.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:44.968
Okay.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.471
Ah!
Easy peasy, huh, Rick?

01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:49.596
Easy peasy.

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:50.757
All right, come on, let's go!

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:52.099
Yeah.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:04.445
My computer.

01:12:04.446 --> 01:12:06.196
Yeah, your computer, right.

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:07.990
What exactly do
you want me to do?

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:11.536
Rick, the plan is you point
it out, we hit it. Get it?

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:15.414
Son?

01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:17.737
Do you know what
we're doing here?

01:12:18.419 --> 01:12:20.169
I have no idea.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:23.422
Physics, Rick.
The laws of physics.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:25.340
If the Roboshark is gonna
communicate with the mothership,

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.468
it's gonna take time.

01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:30.804
NASA says more than 10 minutes
roundtrip just to say howdy.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:33.265
That's our window.
It'll be vulnerable.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.586
Forced to wait for a handshake
before it sends its message.

01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:37.479
The Roboshark will
be a sitting duck.

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:41.523
Shark, whatever.
Look, Rick.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:44.152
You have to help us find the Roboshark.
Tell us where it is.

01:12:44.402 --> 01:12:46.153
Um...

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:48.739
Now, Rick.
Okay, yeah, no, I got this, okay.

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.159
Um, yeah, here we go.

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:58.832
It's here.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.459
Admiral, we have a signal.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.294
Jam it.
Aye-aye, sir.

01:13:02.295 --> 01:13:03.629
Call the gun ships.
Warm up the cruise missiles.

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.465
And get me that tactical nuke.

01:13:05.466 --> 01:13:06.382
Yes, sir.

01:13:06.383 --> 01:13:07.467
Admiral.

01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:11.638
Just making sure
you're paying attention, son.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.561
Somewhere around here,
maybe a little further.

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.647
Okay.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.152
This is Trish Lanson,
reporting live

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:29.489
on the Roboshark
from the Space Needle.

01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.406
Why it's decided to come here
is not yet known,

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.160
but something appears to be
attracting it to this location.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:38.373
Uh... Melody, come back here!

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.707
Come on!

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:41.751
Come back!

01:14:43.647 --> 01:14:44.772
It's overloading.

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.488
We've got to
shut this down, now.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.615
Where are the 130s?

01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:55.824
Seconds away, sir.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.492
Preparing to engage.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.829
Admiral, if you don't get my
wife and daughter out of there,

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.206
a million people are gonna
watch you blow them up.

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:04.958
Live.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.502
Now tell me how you're gonna explain
that to the Senate subcommittee

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:09.297
investigating who
blew up Seattle?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:14.009
Damn social media.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.261
Can't run a proper war anymore.

01:15:17.639 --> 01:15:18.932
Get her out of there.
Yes, sir.

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.141
Thank you.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.437
What the hell is she doing?

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:36.240
There, there.

01:16:00.974 --> 01:16:02.266
There, there.

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.814
There, there.

01:16:09.107 --> 01:16:11.234
Melody, I'm so proud of you.

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:21.119
She's petting
the Roboshark, sir.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.624
What kind of Free Willy
nonsense is going on here?

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.166
Don't you see?

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.253
Roboshark has
changed its message.

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:33.798
She could be
saving us all, Admiral.

01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:34.841
That's my girl.

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.988
No! No! No!

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.668
Call in the helos.
We're pulling out.

01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:11.669
Aye-aye, sir.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.396
Are you okay, honey?
Mom!

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:32.690
Let me go!

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:34.649
Get off me!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.735
- Are you okay?
- Please!

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.006
Are you okay?

01:17:58.758 --> 01:18:00.509
Melody, you're okay!

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.302
They killed it, Mom.
No, honey. It's okay.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:04.263
I think it's okay now. Okay?

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.729
Admiral, do something.
Roboshark is gonna get her.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.855
Relax, son, we're all over this.

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:14.981
How long before target lock?

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:15.982
They got it, sir.

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:41.134
Get back!

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:46.429
Yeah, baby!

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:49.892
Admiral, is that a bomber?
You can't bomb my family!

01:18:49.893 --> 01:18:51.726
I understand, son.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:54.480
Damn thing took out my sub.
That boat was my first command.

01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:56.649
Broke my heart.

01:19:01.822 --> 01:19:02.947
Oh, my God!

01:19:02.948 --> 01:19:03.948
No, Mom, no!

01:19:16.544 --> 01:19:17.752
Yes.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:18.753
Yes!

01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:37.439
They killed it again, Mom.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.650
I know, honey.
You're okay though.

01:19:43.029 --> 01:19:46.824
Admiral, you did it!
You saved her!

01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:49.201
Sorry.
That's what we do, right, boss?

01:19:49.202 --> 01:19:50.870
Confirm the kill.

01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:52.621
Confirm the kill!

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:53.997
That was amazing!

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.081
Trish, Mel.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:56.791
Louie!

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:57.960
I got everything.
We're trending.

01:19:57.961 --> 01:19:58.961
Yes!

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:01.755
Erik! Erik!

01:20:01.756 --> 01:20:02.956
I'm coming.
I'm right with you.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.844
Hey, Erik, my man.
Hey, brother.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:11.556
Are you kidding me?
We got scooped by those two again?

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:14.351
This is all your fault,
you ignorant moron!

01:20:14.352 --> 01:20:15.894
What?

01:20:15.895 --> 01:20:17.980
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

01:20:17.981 --> 01:20:19.981
Careful with the camera!

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.524
Confirming the kill, Admiral.

01:20:21.525 --> 01:20:24.402
Believe target is vaporized.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:27.239
We need 100% confirmation
on that kill.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:29.699
Get in there and
get a closer look.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.953
Copy that.
Closing back on the target.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.215
Incoming! We've got incoming!

01:20:57.896 --> 01:20:59.062
I know, right?

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:01.273
I need a close-up,
get closer!

01:21:01.274 --> 01:21:02.983
Are you crazy?
This is a Roboshark!

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:05.485
That is a price I am willing
to pay for greatness, Erik.

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:06.486
You're willing to pay!

01:21:11.742 --> 01:21:12.993
It's gonna hit us!

01:21:12.994 --> 01:21:13.994
It's gonna hit us!

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.205
Brace for it!

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.970
We're all gonna die!

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:46.444
Guys, can we please
get out of here?

01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:55.660
Get in there and
get the damn shot!

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:57.954
This is a bad idea, Veronica.

01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.832
Damn it, Erik.

01:22:00.875 --> 01:22:01.875
Amateur.

01:22:05.005 --> 01:22:06.838
Veronica, no,
it's too dangerous!

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:08.757
Shut up, weather girl!

01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:11.760
Let me show you
how the pros do it.

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.521
Don't talk to my mom
like that, you little...

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:16.431
Yes!

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.518
Yes! I'm gonna get
a Peabody for this!

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.443
We're gonna need a bigger bang.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:32.322
Contact the battleship.
Have them target the break.

01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:34.157
You mean, target Roboshark.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.492
You heard me
right the first time.

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:38.244
Target this tower,
where the break is.

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.538
Have them hit it with
everything they've got.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.832
We're gonna pancake
that son of a bitch.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:45.335
You mean, you wanna drop
the top of the Space Needle...

01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:46.669
Was I not clear the first time?

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:47.671
Yes, sir.

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.430
We're gonna drop the Space
Needle on Roboshark?

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:53.802
That's right, Rick.

01:22:53.803 --> 01:22:57.722
But this is
the iconic symbol of Seattle!

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.843
Well, I guess it's just gonna
have to get another one.

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:01.602
No, no.

01:23:03.104 --> 01:23:04.104
Whoa!

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.907
Here comes the Emmy.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:24.499
You and sewer guy get
the hell out of here.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.085
Sir, there's plenty of time.

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:31.090
They'll just Twitter and Facebook
me to a Senate committee.

01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:33.216
Best to go down with the ship.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:34.417
Now, get the hell out of here!

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:36.804
That's a direct order, sailor!

01:23:39.390 --> 01:23:40.974
Aye-aye, sir.

01:23:40.975 --> 01:23:41.976
Oorah.
Oorah.

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:50.317
It's just me and
you now, Roboshark.

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:53.862
Help me.

01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:12.297
Veronica, get out of there!
It's gonna fall on you!

01:24:12.298 --> 01:24:14.467
Yeah, right, weather skank.

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:19.472
Veronica, run!

01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:29.315
Yee-haw!

01:24:43.454 --> 01:24:46.122
Melody, are you okay?

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:48.249
Mom, is...

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.169
Yeah, Veronica's dead.

01:24:50.170 --> 01:24:52.129
No, I mean Roboshark.

01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.130
Oh.

01:24:53.881 --> 01:24:55.131
I think so.

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:11.524
Trish! Melody!
Rick!

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:14.318
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:25:14.319 --> 01:25:15.693
Dad!

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:17.070
Are you okay?
Yes.

01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:18.404
Oh. Oh.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:19.405
Thank God.

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:22.159
We made it.

01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:31.251
Oh, thank God.
