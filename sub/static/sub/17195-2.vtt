00:16.860 --> 00:19.140
Like your own company, do you?

00:19.140 --> 00:20.860
Don't you?

00:20.860 --> 00:23.860
I was born here.
I haven't got a choice.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.980
We've all got a choice, Delme.
Right.

00:31.940 --> 00:32.980
Good.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.980
Oh, arrived at the farm.

00:38.980 --> 00:40.900
It's for you. Thanks.

02:22.780 --> 02:26.820
Call came this morning, sir.
Didn't leave a name. Said there was
something here we should see.

02:26.820 --> 02:30.900
Did we get the caller's number? Pay
as you go, sir. Untraceable. Male
caller. Victim's name?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.700
Idris Williams. Victim's car?

02:32.700 --> 02:35.820
I believe so. Find out when it was
last driven. Yes, sir.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.460
Trauma to the back the head.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.339
Single blow.

04:21.940 --> 04:22.980
Time of death?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.180
Working on it.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.380
It's like stepping back in time.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.380
Cameras. I don't see any cameras.

06:19.780 --> 06:20.820
Stolen?

07:06.460 --> 07:09.460
Idris Williams. 69 years old.

07:09.460 --> 07:12.420
Lives alone. No wife. No children.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.780
What's the latest on the car?

07:13.780 --> 07:16.620
Regularly taxed and serviced
until six years ago.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.420
Hasn't been driven since.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.540
So how does he get about?

07:19.540 --> 07:23.420
He doesn't. Idris doesn't go
out into the real world.

07:23.420 --> 07:24.820
The world comes to him.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.460
Sir? Nearest shop?
Four miles away, you say?

07:27.460 --> 07:29.620
Pont Erwyd, sir.
That's too far to walk.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.540
There was food in the freezer.
Find out who does deliveries.

07:32.540 --> 07:35.620
What about neighbours?
Closest farm is two miles away, sir.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.340
Talk to them. See what they know.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.540
Let's get the name
and addresses of every farm hand

07:39.540 --> 07:42.180
and mechanic that's ever
worked on that mountain.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.900
It may be a ghost town now
but go back ten years,

07:45.900 --> 07:48.100
Parc y Boda was a fully
functioning farm.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.860
Get on to local pawn brokers. And
see if anyone's been trying to
off-load camera gear.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.740
You think it might have been a
robbery? It's a line of inquiry.

07:54.740 --> 07:58.700
No sign of forced entry. Suggests
the victim knows his killer.
Or he doesn't lock the door.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.980
The man liked to take pictures.
Thousands of them. Trees.

08:05.980 --> 08:10.100
Rivers. Mountains. Look at
them. What's missing?

08:13.740 --> 08:14.740
Faces.

08:16.620 --> 08:19.900
Hundreds of images.
And not one single face.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.740
The man likes his own company.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.980
He must have shared these
pictures with somebody.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.460
Let's find out who else
gets to see these photographs.

08:26.460 --> 08:29.340
Maybe he didn't want anybody
else to see them.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.340
They look pretty depressing to me.

08:33.340 --> 08:34.980
What's this place?

08:34.980 --> 08:36.580
That could be anywhere.

08:36.580 --> 08:41.179
Old wrecks like that are ten-a-penny
round here, sir.

09:10.660 --> 09:11.660
Moving out?

09:14.380 --> 09:17.860
The world's gone digital -
haven't you heard?

09:17.860 --> 09:20.260
Is that your father's
name above the door?

09:21.820 --> 09:24.380
Who's asking?

09:24.380 --> 09:27.900
I'm here about an old
customer of his. Idris Williams.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.020
Lived up on the mountain.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.860
Something happened?

09:37.860 --> 09:39.660
We found his body this morning.

09:41.860 --> 09:44.100
It looks like Mr Williams was
murdered.

09:45.140 --> 09:48.660
I thought perhaps your father might
remember him. Is he about?

09:52.340 --> 09:55.580
Dad passed away nine years ago.

09:55.580 --> 09:59.700
I'm sorry. What about you?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.740
Do you know the man I'm
talking about?

10:06.620 --> 10:08.340
Sorry, I don't remember him.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.020
He used to shop here.

10:13.020 --> 10:14.660
Him and half of Aberystwyth.

10:17.260 --> 10:22.060
Well, if you do remember anything.
Give me a call.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.660
It's a nice shop.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.180
Did you know him?

11:06.180 --> 11:09.460
I went up to the farm a couple
of times in my vet training days

11:09.460 --> 11:11.460
to see how things were done.

11:11.460 --> 11:14.180
And since then?
Not really my patch.

11:14.180 --> 11:16.860
The vet's name was Vaughan.
Thomas Vaughan.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.740
Do you remember where this
Thomas Vaughan was based?

11:19.740 --> 11:22.220
He had a practice over
Tregaron way, I think.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.900
Used to come over in his Triumph.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.420
What are you doing?

11:25.420 --> 11:28.460
Phoning the office.
We need to talk to him.

11:28.460 --> 11:31.180
You'll have to dig him up first.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.180
Old Vaughan's been dead 30 years.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.260
It was an odd thing, you know.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.780
When he died there were three
or four of us
in the running to take over.

11:40.780 --> 11:45.580
Old Caradog Williams, Idris's
father, had over 300 acres up there.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.380
Dairy herd, sheep,
it was quite an operation.

11:48.380 --> 11:50.900
He'd have been one hell of a client.

11:52.340 --> 11:55.020
I take it you didn't get the call?
Nobody did.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.500
Caradog Williams passed
away shortly after

11:58.500 --> 12:01.700
and over a period of 12 months,
Idris sold the herd,

12:01.700 --> 12:04.540
got shot of all the machinery,
and shut the whole place down.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.380
The Williams place hasn't been
farmed in decades.

12:10.740 --> 12:13.180
MATHIAS: 'What sort of a man
does that?'

12:13.180 --> 12:14.700
'A man who's had enough.'

12:14.700 --> 12:16.780
Enough of what? Running a farm?

12:16.780 --> 12:18.860
He wouldn't be the first.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.420
'No, I don't buy it.'

12:20.420 --> 12:23.060
Why didn't he just get somebody in
to run the farm for him?

12:23.060 --> 12:26.020
Perhaps he preferred to be alone,
didn't like people,

12:26.020 --> 12:28.420
found it hard to form relationships?

12:28.420 --> 12:31.220
'Or maybe he was making
a statement.' Such as?

12:31.220 --> 12:33.980
Erasing the past,
his father's legacy.

12:33.980 --> 12:35.980
'Leaving it all to rot.'

12:35.980 --> 12:39.300
'A statement? For whose benefit?
You saw the photos.'

12:39.300 --> 12:42.820
The only person in Idris's
world was Idris.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.620
'No, there was somebody else,
we just haven't found them yet.'

12:46.660 --> 12:47.980
Talk later.

12:49.420 --> 12:53.460
Results from pathology.
Time of death - Monday pm.

13:59.220 --> 14:00.700
THUMP

16:19.460 --> 16:21.620
That's right.
Williams, Idris Williams.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.300
His father's name was Caradog.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.580
Look at the date.
It was taken a week ago.

16:26.980 --> 16:31.100
You think this is the killer? Or the
last person to see Idris alive.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.380
Sir? Yeah.
According to the Land Registry,

16:36.380 --> 16:38.780
the farm never belonged to Idris.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.940
In October 1982, ownership
of the farm was transferred.

16:41.940 --> 16:44.620
Transferred? To who?
The Guild, sir.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.579
DCI Mathias?

17:06.579 --> 17:08.900
Herbert Rees, Master of the Guild.

17:08.900 --> 17:11.740
His body was discovered at
the farm after police received

17:11.740 --> 17:15.339
an anonymous call. Police are keen
to identify the caller...

17:16.780 --> 17:19.819
Under the terms of the agreement,
Idris was made, what they call,

17:19.819 --> 17:22.940
a non-paying tenant.
A tenant on his own farm?

17:22.940 --> 17:25.099
From a legal standpoint, yes.

17:25.099 --> 17:27.300
But in practical terms,
as long as Idris remained

17:27.300 --> 17:30.420
living on the mountain, he was free
to do as he pleased with the estate.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.260
It was his home after all.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.620
Must be an expensive place to run.
We manage.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.660
My apologies for the mess.
We're in the middle of renovations.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.300
Here we are.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.860
Caradog Williams?

17:54.860 --> 17:59.380
Master of the Guild from 1958
until his death in 1982.

17:59.380 --> 18:02.300
The man was greatly admired.
Is that right?

18:03.740 --> 18:05.580
His civic record speaks for itself.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.780
And what about his record
as a father?

18:08.780 --> 18:11.860
The relationship between Caradog
and his son was complicated.

18:11.860 --> 18:13.380
How?

18:15.020 --> 18:17.540
Idris's mother died
when he was very young.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.180
Brain haemorrhage. Sudden.

18:19.180 --> 18:22.220
Rumour has it he had a breakdown.
The boy was never the same again.

18:22.220 --> 18:25.260
And their relationship afterwards?
Caradog had a farm to run.

18:25.260 --> 18:28.740
Idris was never going to be strong
enough to take over the business.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.340
But Idris stayed
there his whole life. Yes.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.620
He ran the accounts
until his father's death.

18:34.620 --> 18:35.940
And after that?

18:36.980 --> 18:38.780
There was nothing to account for.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.740
You must have known
Idris. Had dealings with him.
How did you find him?

18:44.740 --> 18:48.100
Cordial. Quiet.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.180
You didn't sense any bitterness
in the man? Any anger?

18:51.180 --> 18:53.060
Not that I recall. Why?

18:54.540 --> 18:56.780
You don't think it
was a cruel of Caradog,

18:56.780 --> 18:59.220
to deny his own
son his inheritance like that?

18:59.220 --> 19:01.900
As far as I know, Idris
was happy with the arrangement.

19:01.900 --> 19:05.180
The man had no children. This way
he got to live on the mountain

19:05.180 --> 19:07.900
without any concern
for the future. Security.

19:07.900 --> 19:11.300
Isn't that what everybody wants?
That depends on the price.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.220
Where were you on Monday afternoon
and evening, Mr Rees?

19:17.700 --> 19:21.420
I was in court in the afternoon
and here in the evening. Alone?

19:21.420 --> 19:23.300
No. With the other members.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.900
First Monday of the month.
A little ritual of ours.

19:30.020 --> 19:33.100
Parc y Boda. Idris's farm, right?

19:33.100 --> 19:36.060
Yes, it's the only farm
for miles around. Ah.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.100
Well, what's this over here?

21:15.740 --> 21:17.740
Tramp? Maybe.

22:30.180 --> 22:33.140
Talygroes has been empty
for the last 40 years.

22:33.140 --> 22:36.860
The man who used to live there
was called Eric Roberts. Died 1974.

22:36.860 --> 22:40.220
After he died, ownership of the farm
was passed to his neighbour.

22:40.220 --> 22:41.780
Caradog Williams. Yes.

22:41.780 --> 22:46.100
Sir! Cambria Meat Supplies.
They've got a driver, Dylan Bevan.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.740
Delivers meat to the farm
once a month. Last delivery?

22:48.740 --> 22:50.460
Monday. Hasn't been seen since.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.180
Drives a blue Fiat.
Registration N186 JRK.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.780
Any sign of it?
No, usually parked out front.

23:11.780 --> 23:13.660
We're trying to trace it now.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.180
Clear!

23:28.940 --> 23:33.220
Sian! Sir? There's a photograph
of a little girl in uniform.
Find out who she is.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.620
Sir!

23:41.820 --> 23:43.580
I'll call forensics.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.660
Sian, we've found
the victim's cameras.

23:52.740 --> 23:55.700
Little girl's name is Ffion.
She's a pupil in Maes-y-Dderwen.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.380
The mother's name is Ceri Jones.
Clean?

23:58.380 --> 24:01.820
Police were called out at Christmas.
Domestic. She moved out after that.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.740
We got an address? Yep.

24:09.900 --> 24:12.100
Good work. Thank you, sir.

24:32.660 --> 24:34.740
Ceri Jones?

24:35.740 --> 24:37.380
Do you mind if we come in?

24:42.260 --> 24:44.020
Yeah, I know the place.

24:44.020 --> 24:46.740
We used to go up there sometimes.

24:48.460 --> 24:51.660
What about Mr Williams?
Did you ever meet him? Once.

24:54.020 --> 24:56.660
Me and Dyl had a row
and he drove off.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.660
Used to do it all the time.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.180
Thought it was funny.

25:01.940 --> 25:03.980
The, erm, the old man saw me crying

25:03.980 --> 25:06.900
and came out into the field,
and gave me a glass of water.

25:06.900 --> 25:08.380
How did you find him?

25:09.900 --> 25:11.860
He seemed kind of sad to me.

25:13.340 --> 25:15.380
Living up there on his own,
I'm not surprised.

25:16.660 --> 25:18.740
What about Dylan?
Did he ever talk about him?

25:20.140 --> 25:22.700
Not really.
Didn't have much to do with him.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.820
You don't know of any
issues between them? No.

25:34.260 --> 25:35.380
Ffion...

25:41.940 --> 25:44.220
Don't worry, Ffion. She won't bite.

25:54.060 --> 25:55.820
How often does Dylan see Ffion?

25:57.940 --> 26:00.860
Is that your decision or his?
Does it make a difference?

26:00.860 --> 26:03.460
Doesn't a man have a right
to see his daughter?

26:10.180 --> 26:11.820
Is this Dylan?

26:12.820 --> 26:15.060
It could be anyone.

26:15.060 --> 26:16.820
You recognise the farm?

26:18.020 --> 26:20.820
Yeah, I know it.
When you and Dylan went up there?

26:20.820 --> 26:22.700
The place gave me the creeps.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.660
What about Dylan?
Did it give him the creeps?

26:25.700 --> 26:27.380
Why don't you ask him?

26:29.140 --> 26:31.500
I know what happened
over Christmas, Ceri.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.620
I should never have called
the police. No, you were scared.
You were right to call.

26:35.620 --> 26:37.580
No. I was tired.

26:37.580 --> 26:40.060
Tired of all the promises,
tired of all the drinking.

26:40.060 --> 26:41.460
Does Dylan smoke?

26:42.620 --> 26:44.540
I mean what brand?

26:44.540 --> 26:47.100
Whatever he can get
his hands on.

26:51.060 --> 26:54.020
You're not in any kind of trouble,
you know that, don't you?

26:54.020 --> 26:56.740
I'm just trying to work out
what kind of man he is.

27:39.380 --> 27:42.540
'Cruelty to animals. Could
suggest psychotic tendencies.'

27:42.540 --> 27:45.180
Didn't you pull the wings
off butterflies when you were a kid?

27:45.180 --> 27:47.540
No, I didn't actually.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.100
'Oh.'

27:49.100 --> 27:50.940
That was the lab, sir.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.420
There's a film in one of the cameras
we found at the scene.

27:53.420 --> 27:56.100
It's been exposed to the light.
They're doing what they can.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.940
'I'm on my way back.' OK.

28:00.460 --> 28:03.100
This doesn't make any bloody sense.
What doesn't? Talygroes.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.540
This is the land boundary
in 1971,

28:15.540 --> 28:17.260
three years before
Eric Roberts died,

28:17.260 --> 28:18.860
the last time Talygroes was listed.

28:20.540 --> 28:22.660
Now look at the boundary
here in 1948.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.380
They're different.
I know, sir, but there's more.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.300
1956.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.540
1962.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.860
1967.

28:31.860 --> 28:35.060
Talygroes gets
smaller and smaller every time.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.140
So Roberts is winding it down.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.900
Selling it off piece by piece.
That's what I thought but...

28:39.900 --> 28:43.060
These are the accounts
of Caradog Williams's place.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.580
Look at them.

28:44.580 --> 28:47.180
No record of any payments
to his neighbour. Nothing.

28:47.180 --> 28:50.940
Why would Roberts do that? Hand his
land over like that for no money?

28:50.940 --> 28:52.500
Exactly.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.420
Maybe the farm was too much for him.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.500
He had nobody else
to leave it to, no kids.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.780
No. No, no,
there were children at Talygroes.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.860
There were notches
cut into the doorframe.
Find out what happened to them.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.980
Caradog Williams?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.300
I thought perhaps you knew him, sir?

29:10.300 --> 29:13.420
Now why would you think that?
Never met the man.

29:13.420 --> 29:16.460
What about his son, Idris Williams?
Did you know him?

29:16.460 --> 29:19.180
No-one did. Herbert Rees did.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.020
Herbert Rees has an alibi.

29:21.020 --> 29:24.380
What's the latest on Bevan?
You think he's left town?

29:24.380 --> 29:26.940
Traffic are still trying
to trace his car, sir.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.860
You think he might strike again?
We're doing everything we can.

29:31.260 --> 29:31.940
Sir?

29:32.980 --> 29:35.460
There were two children
in Talygroes, a boy and a girl.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.700
The youngest, Aneirin,
left Aber in the late '60s,

29:37.700 --> 29:41.180
moved up north, Bethesda way.
Died 2008.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.260
The older girl, Enid, never married.

29:43.260 --> 29:46.980
She was still living at Talygroes
with her father when he died.
And after that?

29:46.980 --> 29:49.980
When Caradog took over the land,
she was moved off the mountain,

29:49.980 --> 29:51.740
put in a house
on the old road to Borth.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.340
Enid Roberts.
Find out what she knows.

29:58.340 --> 30:01.620
Shouldn't we be concentrating on
Bevan? Sian can handle Bevan.

30:01.620 --> 30:05.300
These maps, right,
they're 70 years old,
where are you going with this?

30:05.300 --> 30:07.380
Idris took photos of landscapes.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.060
Apart from the ruin at Talygroes.
So?

30:10.060 --> 30:13.060
Someone had his photograph
taken up there. Who is he?

30:13.060 --> 30:16.420
Why didn't he want anyone else to
see him? Have you run this past
Prosser?

30:16.420 --> 30:18.100
Do I have to?

30:18.100 --> 30:22.500
Idris Williams may have withdrawn
from the world but it doesn't mean
he's lost interest in it.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.580
He may be an old recluse to everyone
else, but he's not to me.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.460
Photo from the victim's camera, sir.

31:31.860 --> 31:33.540
When was it taken?

31:34.900 --> 31:36.300
Three weeks ago.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.300
You were up at the farm? Yes.

31:42.420 --> 31:44.940
Is that the last time you saw
Idris Williams?

31:46.540 --> 31:48.460
When did you last see him, Nia?

31:49.940 --> 31:51.380
Monday.

31:52.260 --> 31:53.940
What time?

31:53.940 --> 31:57.580
Late afternoon. Four? Five?
How long were you up there?

31:58.700 --> 32:02.620
Not long. Minutes.
He... He was different. Agitated.

32:02.620 --> 32:05.380
He wouldn't let me into the house.
He told me I should go.

32:05.380 --> 32:07.540
You think there was somebody
there with him? Yeah.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.300
Did you see anybody? No.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.700
A car parked in the yard?
A delivery van?

32:12.700 --> 32:14.940
Does the name Dylan Bevan
mean anything to you?

32:16.860 --> 32:19.220
He delivers meat to the farm.
I don't know him.

32:20.740 --> 32:24.420
When I asked you yesterday if you
knew Idris Williams, you told me no.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.500
But you've just told us
you were up at the farm.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.780
Why didn't you tell us
this yesterday?

32:29.820 --> 32:32.660
I didn't want anyone to know
I'd been up there. Why not?

32:37.500 --> 32:39.660
Were you having an affair
with Idris Williams?

32:43.300 --> 32:45.300
It's more complicated than that.
Go on.

32:48.180 --> 32:51.300
We had something
for a couple of years,

32:53.740 --> 32:58.140
and I called it off a year ago
when my husband found out.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.180
You promised your husband
that it was over?

33:02.180 --> 33:05.340
You promised him
that you wouldn't go up there again.

33:05.340 --> 33:06.860
But you did.

33:08.980 --> 33:11.140
Did you still
have feelings for Idris?

33:12.860 --> 33:14.940
Did Idris still have
feelings for you?

33:21.460 --> 33:24.580
I think the person who took this
picture loved you very much.

33:36.740 --> 33:39.620
'You mustn't tell my husband.'
Why not?'

33:39.620 --> 33:42.460
I've let him down before.
I can't do it to him again.

33:45.540 --> 33:49.020
Where were you Monday night?
After you left the farm?

33:49.020 --> 33:51.420
Home. Alone? Yes.

33:51.420 --> 33:54.300
I'm going to have to speak
with your husband. You already have.

33:55.940 --> 33:59.100
It's Herbert Rees.
You met him at the Guild.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.380
Do you think she's telling
the truth?

34:25.260 --> 34:27.860
I know the difference
between grief and guilt.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.380
Herbert Rees.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.980
His wife was having an affair
with Idris Williams.

34:36.980 --> 34:39.860
Alibi checked out, sir. There were
nine of them at the Guild.

34:39.860 --> 34:43.219
All of them willing to testify.
You want to bring him in, sir?

34:43.219 --> 34:45.780
No. No, he's a solicitor.
He'd be all over us.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.659
Find out what you can.

34:47.659 --> 34:50.420
Phone records, business interests,
associates. Everything.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.540
They've found Bevan's van, sir.
Off Bridge Street.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.220
He's still in Aber.

36:51.220 --> 36:52.460
Mathias.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.140
Is Daddy still in the house
with you now?

36:56.140 --> 36:57.980
He's in the kitchen with Mammy.

36:57.980 --> 37:01.980
'OK, just do as I say, all right.
Stay where you are.
It's very important.'

37:01.980 --> 37:03.740
Don't go into the kitchen.

37:06.740 --> 37:09.940
He's hurting her. I'm on my way,
Ffion. Just stay where you are.

37:09.940 --> 37:11.660
Keep her talking.

37:13.900 --> 37:16.500
We need back up now.
And get an ambulance up there!

37:24.540 --> 37:26.300
Ffion?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.380
Ffion?

37:53.780 --> 37:55.220
Ceri?

39:02.740 --> 39:03.940
Dylan?

39:12.140 --> 39:15.580
'Did it make you feel good?
Knocking her about like that?

39:15.580 --> 39:17.740
'Did it make you feel like a man?'

39:17.740 --> 39:21.580
And killing Idris Williams.
Did it make you feel like a man too?

39:21.580 --> 39:24.060
I didn't kill him.
So what happened then, Dylan?

39:25.100 --> 39:27.260
I went up there like I always do.

39:27.260 --> 39:29.860
Put the meat in the freezer.
Picked up my money...

39:29.860 --> 39:32.380
The door was open.
There was nobody about.

39:32.380 --> 39:34.420
Had you been in the house before?

39:35.460 --> 39:39.260
But you knew the old man took
pictures. You knew he had cameras
in the house.

39:39.260 --> 39:41.740
And you took them.
You don't know what it's like.

39:41.740 --> 39:45.140
My little girl means everything to
me and I got nothing to give her.

39:45.140 --> 39:47.380
And you decided to help yourself?

39:47.380 --> 39:48.940
She deserves the best.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.340
He was on the floor

39:57.340 --> 39:58.980
'in the kitchen.

39:59.940 --> 40:02.180
'I didn't see him at first.'

40:02.180 --> 40:04.140
Pushed open the door and...

40:05.260 --> 40:07.340
There was nothing I could do.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.980
The back of his head
was all messed up.

40:09.980 --> 40:11.660
There was blood...

40:13.020 --> 40:15.660
'You didn't try and help him?'

40:15.660 --> 40:17.940
The man was dead.

40:17.940 --> 40:20.540
I got back in the van. I left.

40:20.540 --> 40:23.980
It was only when I got back to Aber
I realised I still had the cameras.

40:23.980 --> 40:26.620
But you knew we'd be
looking for you.

40:26.620 --> 40:29.020
If you are so innocent,
why did you go to Ceri's?

40:29.020 --> 40:31.180
Why not come straight to me?
I needed to talk to her.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.660
To shut her up?
To stop her feeding you lies.

40:33.660 --> 40:36.460
Like the fact you beat the crap out
of her at Christmas? Those lies?

40:36.460 --> 40:39.020
You've seen my record. GBH, ABH.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.220
A few words from her,
and it's over for me.

40:41.220 --> 40:44.300
Tonight, why didn't you run?

40:48.700 --> 40:50.940
To prove to her that I didn't do it.

40:55.140 --> 40:59.060
I didn't kill the old man!
He was already dead!

40:59.060 --> 41:02.220
I called the police.
What more could I do?

41:06.420 --> 41:08.420
The anonymous call, sir.

41:11.820 --> 41:14.060
I couldn't get it out of my head.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.340
The old man...

41:18.580 --> 41:20.500
..lying there.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.220
An opportunist? Yes.

41:27.220 --> 41:29.700
But his fingerprints
were everywhere.

41:29.700 --> 41:31.660
Everywhere except the kitchen, sir.

41:31.660 --> 41:34.100
He's the last person I'd put
on my Christmas list, sir,

41:34.100 --> 41:36.220
but we've checked his
mobile phone records.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.460
He definitely made the call.

41:38.460 --> 41:39.660
So we release him?

41:39.660 --> 41:41.540
No, we eliminate him
from our enquiry.

41:41.540 --> 41:45.140
But we charge him
under section 47 for assault.

41:45.140 --> 41:46.140
Where next?

42:06.220 --> 42:08.300
I've got an address
for Enid Roberts.

42:08.300 --> 42:10.500
An old people's home on the front.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.900
I'll get onto it first thing
in the morning. Good night.

42:57.580 --> 42:59.940
We try and encourage them
to eat together.

42:59.940 --> 43:03.380
Gets them out of their rooms
for a bit, breaks up the day.

43:03.380 --> 43:04.780
But not Enid?

43:05.980 --> 43:08.580
Enid likes to keep herself
to herself.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.780
Any particular reason?

43:10.780 --> 43:14.180
Early stages dementia.
She has good days and bad days.

43:14.180 --> 43:16.460
But we do what we can.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.420
Miss Roberts?

43:53.660 --> 43:55.140
Idris Williams.

44:48.740 --> 44:51.660
MATHIAS: 'Tell me everything
you know about Talygroes.'

44:51.660 --> 44:54.220
I can't help you, I'm afraid.

44:54.220 --> 44:56.020
Really?

44:56.020 --> 44:57.980
A man called Eric Roberts
used to live there.

44:57.980 --> 44:59.820
Next to Idris Williams' place.

44:59.820 --> 45:01.220
Before my time.

45:01.220 --> 45:04.420
That's a pity.
See, I've been trying to work out

45:04.420 --> 45:08.620
why Mr Roberts handed over his land
to our friend in the frame there.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.580
I can't help you with that.
Like I said...

45:12.580 --> 45:13.860
Before your time.

45:15.460 --> 45:18.940
Must be worth quite a bit,
the Caradog estate.

45:18.940 --> 45:20.460
Hard to say.

45:20.460 --> 45:23.500
At least now that his son's dead
you'll get to cash in.

45:23.500 --> 45:25.700
I take it the Guild has plans?

45:25.700 --> 45:28.180
Oh, we haven't really thought
about it. No?

45:28.180 --> 45:31.380
Hardly seemed appropriate while
the man was still living there.

45:31.380 --> 45:32.700
Of course.

45:34.980 --> 45:37.060
Must have been galling for you,

45:37.060 --> 45:41.220
watching Idris idle away the years
on that mountain.

45:41.220 --> 45:44.220
And then to find out
he was screwing your wife.

45:48.220 --> 45:50.700
Still, the man took a lovely photo.

45:54.860 --> 45:56.180
I haven't got time for this.

45:56.180 --> 45:58.780
I've have more important things
to do with my morning.

45:58.780 --> 46:00.420
More important than murder?

46:20.540 --> 46:22.780
I think you've known for weeks
about the affair.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.980
The fact it was still going on.
No comment.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.500
She was up there three weeks ago
posing for photographs.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.660
Maybe you went up there
to get something signed,

46:30.660 --> 46:32.620
saw her car in the yard?
No comment.

46:32.620 --> 46:35.580
The moment you found out about it,
that's when it became personal.

46:35.580 --> 46:39.300
All those years of not being able
to get your hands on Idris' land,

46:39.300 --> 46:42.540
all those years of waiting
while the Guild fell into ruin.

46:45.820 --> 46:47.220
Was that a question?

46:51.340 --> 46:53.260
No comment.

46:58.020 --> 47:00.780
I didn't kill Idris Williams.

47:00.780 --> 47:03.620
As I've already told you,
I was at the Guild.

47:12.820 --> 47:14.540
Let him go. Sir?

47:14.540 --> 47:16.700
The man has an alibi.
We have no reason to hold him.

47:16.700 --> 47:18.820
Direct motive.
We've got to do better than that.

47:18.820 --> 47:20.380
He knows more than he's letting on.

47:20.380 --> 47:23.100
Something happened on that mountain.
More than just murder.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.540
People don't hand over their land
like that for no reason.

47:25.540 --> 47:28.020
Tom, the history of what happened
up there is long gone.

47:28.020 --> 47:30.100
Eric Roberts, Caradog Williams...

47:30.100 --> 47:32.300
The people with the answers
are dead.

47:32.300 --> 47:35.860
You need to concentrate on the case.
Stop chasing ghosts, Tom!

47:56.860 --> 47:58.340
It's the last one on the end.

47:58.340 --> 48:03.980
Thank you, Carol.

48:08.740 --> 48:10.180
Carol!

48:19.780 --> 48:21.860
She's gone. Shit.

48:41.660 --> 48:43.060
Enid!

48:50.820 --> 48:52.780
I should've stopped him.

48:54.580 --> 48:56.140
I should've stopped him.

48:59.500 --> 49:01.220
I'll call an ambulance.

49:06.340 --> 49:08.700
I should've stopped him.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.220
DCI Mathias?

49:39.820 --> 49:42.940
Somebody should be here
when she wakes up. I'll stay.

50:19.740 --> 50:22.300
RINGING TONE

50:28.540 --> 50:31.020
'Hello, it's Meg, leave a message.'

50:32.940 --> 50:36.940
I know you're there, Meg.
Pick up the phone, please.

50:46.000 --> 50:46.620
Meg?

50:46.620 --> 50:48.340
What is it, Lloyd?

50:48.340 --> 50:50.100
He's letting him go.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.260
'Have you been through
all the documents?'

50:52.260 --> 50:53.780
Still going through them now, sir.

50:53.780 --> 50:56.900
Yeah, well, keep going. Rees is
involved somehow. He has to be.

50:56.900 --> 50:59.500
The man has too much to gain.
I'll keep looking, sir.

51:24.860 --> 51:27.860
What else do we know about
Talygroes? Sir?

51:27.860 --> 51:31.100
The same day she finds out
about Idris Williams' murder,

51:31.100 --> 51:33.500
Enid Roberts tries to kill herself.

51:33.500 --> 51:35.580
It's too much of a coincidence.

51:35.580 --> 51:38.420
Something about Idris' murder
upset her.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.420
Took her back to a place, a time.

51:40.420 --> 51:42.860
"I should have stopped him.
I should have stopped him."

51:42.860 --> 51:44.340
Who was she talking about?

52:55.020 --> 52:58.380
Look at the date. 1943.

52:58.380 --> 53:01.940
The middle of the Second World War.
You don't think that's odd?

53:01.940 --> 53:04.580
I guess it explains
why the man couldn't visit.

53:04.580 --> 53:08.500
You think Enid and her German
pen-friend here had a child
together?

53:08.500 --> 53:11.100
How else do you explain it?
She'd be 17.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.380
It happens.

53:13.380 --> 53:16.140
Lloyd, when was the first
land transfer between

53:16.140 --> 53:18.620
Talygroes and the Williams' place?

53:18.620 --> 53:19.820
48, sir.

53:19.820 --> 53:22.100
I'll get a copy
and put it back where I found it

53:22.100 --> 53:23.180
before she wakes up.

55:10.780 --> 55:11.940
Sir.

55:11.940 --> 55:15.580
Provisional Planning Application
for Parc y Boda, the Williams Place.

55:15.580 --> 55:17.660
They want to build 60 turbines, sir.

55:17.660 --> 55:21.940
Bottom of page eight -
look who's behind it.

55:21.940 --> 55:24.340
Herbert Rees.

56:11.700 --> 56:13.260
Herbert?

57:55.500 --> 57:56.780
Herbert!

57:57.305 --> 58:03.480
