00:46.200 --> 00:47.601
It's been almost a year,

00:52.003 --> 00:54.404
yet we still know
nothing about them.

00:59.206 --> 01:00.907
Who they are,

01:01.307 --> 01:02.807
where they come from,

01:04.108 --> 01:05.909
why they went down...

01:09.811 --> 01:12.012
all we know is, since they came,

01:13.912 --> 01:15.813
two quiet hours a day

01:17.914 --> 01:18.915
is all we have.

03:47.682 --> 03:48.782
What was that?

03:49.883 --> 03:50.983
I'm not sure.

03:51.283 --> 03:52.284
A gunshot?

03:52.784 --> 03:53.983
No, it can't be.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.584
No, I heard an engine.

03:55.585 --> 03:57.585
It could have been anything.

03:57.586 --> 03:59.886
What if there were
people out there?

03:59.887 --> 04:02.888
And they found us?
It's nothing, Ok?

04:11.893 --> 04:14.194
Would you shoot someone
if you had to?

04:15.294 --> 04:16.495
Go back to sleep.

04:36.804 --> 04:37.904
What's she saying?

04:42.406 --> 04:44.107
Uh... they've left the UK,

04:46.108 --> 04:48.209
and stopped here.

04:51.810 --> 04:52.910
And some

04:52.911 --> 04:55.612
country's name I couldn't understand.
Shh!

05:13.920 --> 05:15.021
Turn it off!

05:21.924 --> 05:22.924
Why?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.227
Because it creeps me out, Ok?

05:51.037 --> 05:54.339
If you go out the back,
make sure to lock the door behind you, Ok?

09:02.323 --> 09:03.424
Is anybody there?

12:05.005 --> 12:06.006
Hello, survivors.

12:07.707 --> 12:10.108
Tom Connelly here,
playing just for you.

12:24.914 --> 12:25.915
Dad?

12:26.815 --> 12:27.816
Dad?

12:32.618 --> 12:33.618
Who are you?

12:56.729 --> 12:59.429
God what is wrong with you? I
told you to shut the door.

12:59.430 --> 13:00.330
I'm sorry.

13:00.331 --> 13:03.332
That's the second time. Do
you want to get us killed?

13:15.037 --> 13:16.137
He's been shot.

13:16.437 --> 13:17.438
Where?

13:17.938 --> 13:19.039
In the leg.

13:19.939 --> 13:22.340
Could that be what
we heard last night?

13:22.940 --> 13:24.041
Sarah?

13:25.542 --> 13:27.442
Are you gonna fix his leg?

13:28.943 --> 13:29.943
Well, you shouldn't.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.545
He stole our food.

13:41.749 --> 13:43.249
Hold the light closer.

13:45.751 --> 13:46.851
Is he gonna die?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.052
No.

13:50.053 --> 13:51.653
At least no from me hitting him.

14:53.181 --> 14:54.281
What is this?

14:54.682 --> 14:56.082
A survival blanket.

15:17.792 --> 15:18.792
From Manchester.

15:20.493 --> 15:21.494
Twenty-Seven.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.002
What do you see?

15:42.703 --> 15:44.104
One of their mines.

15:45.604 --> 15:47.105
Looks incredibly deep.

15:47.605 --> 15:50.707
I heard they're taking minerals
from the core of the planet.

15:52.107 --> 15:53.208
Can you see them?

15:55.009 --> 15:56.009
No.

16:06.814 --> 16:08.815
<i>What are we gonna do with him?</i>

16:09.415 --> 16:11.316
<i>I don't know, I'm thinking.</i>

16:14.217 --> 16:16.518
<i>We'll have to see what dad
thinks when he gets home?</i>

16:18.419 --> 16:20.120
<i>Do you think he'll be back tonight?</i>

16:24.122 --> 16:25.122
<i>Sarah?</i>

16:25.622 --> 16:28.524
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake,
how could I possibly know?</i>

16:42.230 --> 16:43.230
Good girl.

17:03.339 --> 17:04.339
Coffee?

17:11.843 --> 17:13.344
There ain't much milk.

17:15.045 --> 17:17.246
It's been a while since
she had babies.

17:20.047 --> 17:21.748
Will she stop producing it?

17:23.648 --> 17:24.648
Eventually.

17:31.752 --> 17:32.753
I'm sorry, Ok?

17:43.057 --> 17:44.858
It must be Dad.

17:50.761 --> 17:51.761
Hello?

17:52.462 --> 17:55.963
<i>You'll catch a fever washing
in that filthy water.</i>

17:57.664 --> 17:59.164
<i>Why did you run away?</i>

17:59.165 --> 18:01.566
<i>I meant you no harm.</i>

18:02.766 --> 18:06.168
<i>I suppose you don't see
many people in these parts.</i>

18:06.768 --> 18:09.269
<i>It's quite isolated, isn't it?</i>

18:19.074 --> 18:20.374
<i>What's your name?</i>

18:22.775 --> 18:23.776
Sarah.

18:26.677 --> 18:29.078
<i>You live alone in that big house?</i>

18:29.978 --> 18:30.978
No.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.679
<i>Who else is there?</i>

18:32.680 --> 18:33.680
My brother.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.481
And my father.

18:37.882 --> 18:39.083
<i>How old are you?</i>

18:45.285 --> 18:46.586
I'm twenty-five.

18:47.186 --> 18:48.987
<i>How old are you really?</i>

18:50.688 --> 18:51.688
<i>Eighteen?</i>

18:52.589 --> 18:53.589
<i>Nineteen?</i>

18:55.590 --> 18:56.790
What do you want?

18:57.291 --> 18:58.891
<i>He's there, isn't he?</i>

19:07.595 --> 19:10.396
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:10.397 --> 19:12.598
<i>You're lying to me, Sarah.</i>

19:13.598 --> 19:14.899
<i>Did you tie him up?</i>

19:16.799 --> 19:17.999
Sarah...

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Shh...

19:19.701 --> 19:20.701
<i>Sarah?</i>

19:24.803 --> 19:25.804
<i>Fine.</i>

19:35.508 --> 19:37.809
You've got ten minutes to get him out.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.011
Ten minutes.

19:42.511 --> 19:46.513
Or big, bad wolf will
be knocking on your door.

19:47.513 --> 19:48.514
Over.

19:58.318 --> 19:59.719
How many are there?

20:00.919 --> 20:02.820
I'm not sure. At least two.

20:03.821 --> 20:05.922
I think there night be
more hiding in the back.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.322
Let's just take him
out as she said.

20:09.323 --> 20:10.823
He must be with them.

20:10.824 --> 20:12.624
Then you tell them
it's just the two of us.

20:12.625 --> 20:15.425
And then we'll be screwed.
We might as well kiss our animals goodbye.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.727
He wouldn't know. He's
still knocked out, isn't he?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.527
Come, let's take him out.

20:20.528 --> 20:22.528
So they can invite themselves over?

20:22.529 --> 20:25.230
We can take him out
through the window, I'll help.

20:26.631 --> 20:28.131
I imagine they want to kill him.

20:28.132 --> 20:29.931
So what? He's a thief.

20:29.932 --> 20:33.134
That would be murder.
Sarah, we can't keep him here.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.334
What if he breaks free?
It could be dangerous.

20:36.335 --> 20:38.036
What do you suggest?
That we kill him?

20:50.141 --> 20:51.242
Come with me.

21:27.758 --> 21:29.159
It's stuck.

21:30.560 --> 21:31.560
Sarah?

21:41.665 --> 21:43.865
I didn't mean to frighten you.

21:43.866 --> 21:46.167
Your friend has already contacted us.

21:48.268 --> 21:49.268
My friend?

21:50.068 --> 21:52.570
The woman who contacted
me on my CV.

21:53.470 --> 21:54.470
I'm alone.

21:55.171 --> 21:56.972
Do you think I'm stupid?

21:58.972 --> 22:00.873
They've been following me.

22:01.173 --> 22:02.274
Why?

22:02.874 --> 22:05.275
How did you get here
if you weren't in that van?

22:06.076 --> 22:08.077
I bundled myself inside
survival blankets.

22:08.977 --> 22:10.477
Old ones that the army took out.

22:10.478 --> 22:13.079
They're full of rodents
and asbestos fiber.

22:13.879 --> 22:17.080
They work if the patrol
vessels fly high enough.

22:17.081 --> 22:18.781
But it's like playing
Russian roulette.

22:19.682 --> 22:20.682
I was lucky.

22:24.484 --> 22:27.685
But believe me! These
are not good people.

22:28.786 --> 22:32.387
Untie me and I'll protect the house.
Keep quiet.

22:33.088 --> 22:34.388
I don't trust you.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.590
Is it the uniform?

22:41.191 --> 22:42.992
- Maybe.
- But I'm not a soldier.

22:43.693 --> 22:46.493
I'm a journalist.
They why are you dressed like one?

22:46.494 --> 22:48.595
I took the clothes from a dead one.

22:50.396 --> 22:52.096
Look in my front pocket.

22:52.597 --> 22:53.997
There's a picture in there.

22:54.497 --> 22:56.198
Please take a look at it!

23:05.402 --> 23:06.503
What is it?

23:07.003 --> 23:08.504
That's my wife and daughter.

23:09.304 --> 23:10.304
They're dead.

23:13.606 --> 23:14.706
So what?

23:15.107 --> 23:17.208
Is that suppose to
make you a good man?

23:18.108 --> 23:19.909
Oh, come on! You
can see that I was shot.

23:20.209 --> 23:23.510
Could have been an accident.
A self-inflicted wound.

23:24.511 --> 23:26.312
Do you think you can
hold the four alone?

23:27.912 --> 23:29.812
You don't know what
they're capable of.

23:29.813 --> 23:31.814
They won't stop until
they've got your farm.

23:34.015 --> 23:36.416
Well, it seems to me
like it's you they want.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.017
No, don't delude yourself.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.217
How many farms with
souls and piles

23:41.218 --> 23:43.219
of livestock do you
think you can find.

23:46.721 --> 23:47.721
Please.

23:48.722 --> 23:49.722
Untie me.

23:50.222 --> 23:52.523
So you can open the door to your friends?

23:54.724 --> 23:56.025
You can't beat him alone.

23:56.625 --> 23:58.426
Our father will be back soon.

24:02.828 --> 24:03.929
Where is he?

24:05.629 --> 24:07.330
He went to town to
get some supplies.

24:08.731 --> 24:10.131
And how soon will he be back?

24:12.633 --> 24:13.733
Soon enough.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.436
- How many of them are there?
- Five.

24:22.637 --> 24:25.938
Used to be six, but one of
them was killed by the blasters last night.

24:25.939 --> 24:27.638
- That must be what we...
- Don't.

24:27.639 --> 24:28.839
I went inside an abandoned

24:28.840 --> 24:30.139
house to look for some food,

24:30.140 --> 24:32.240
and one of them
followed me without cover.

24:32.241 --> 24:34.342
I escaped just before the blast.

24:35.443 --> 24:37.443
If what you're telling
me is true, then why are

24:37.444 --> 24:39.044
they trying so hard
to capture you?

24:45.948 --> 24:47.448
You're a liar!

24:49.249 --> 24:50.349
Please.

24:51.850 --> 24:53.051
Let me help you.

25:04.356 --> 25:05.655
No, no!

25:05.656 --> 25:08.557
- What are you doing?
- Shutting him up.

25:08.558 --> 25:11.659
- Let him talk, Sarah!
- Be quiet!

26:09.885 --> 26:12.186
I'm gonna go upstairs, Ok?

27:54.832 --> 27:55.933
Knock knock.

27:56.433 --> 27:58.534
Big bad wolf.

27:59.435 --> 28:00.735
Keep quiet, bitch.

28:02.436 --> 28:03.736
You need to untie me.

28:04.137 --> 28:06.337
<i>Those guys will
kill your sister.</i>

28:06.338 --> 28:09.138
Then they will come down
here and kill me and you.

28:09.139 --> 28:10.640
Do you want that to happen?

28:19.043 --> 28:20.543
There's a knife

28:20.544 --> 28:22.545
in the side pocket of my bag.

28:22.945 --> 28:24.546
Get it for me and let me help.

28:25.346 --> 28:27.347
I'm not going to
lie to you, I promise.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.360
Come here.

29:01.763 --> 29:02.862
Here.

29:02.863 --> 29:05.663
Great. Yeah. Stay there.
No one can see you.

29:05.664 --> 29:07.265
You'll be fine.

29:17.970 --> 29:19.270
No!

30:42.608 --> 30:43.708
Thanks.

30:50.311 --> 30:51.512
Jeez!

30:52.012 --> 30:53.813
Are the other locked?

30:54.213 --> 30:55.314
No.

31:57.642 --> 31:58.942
We'll be safe now.

32:08.246 --> 32:09.847
- Tom?
- Sarah?

32:12.248 --> 32:13.548
Are you Ok?

32:13.549 --> 32:14.549
Yeah.

32:14.550 --> 32:17.050
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing.

32:23.353 --> 32:24.654
Your sister's fine.

32:27.755 --> 32:29.456
Did you hear them leave?

32:29.956 --> 32:31.857
I heard an engine.
They moved a van.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.362
They have broken into the barn.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.564
They'll attack us again at sunset.

32:49.265 --> 32:51.266
That's how everyone
left is killed.

33:08.874 --> 33:10.775
You've done a good
job cleaning up my leg.

33:13.476 --> 33:15.076
You a nursing student?

33:15.977 --> 33:17.478
Something like that.

33:31.784 --> 33:33.085
Tell me what you did to them.

33:34.585 --> 33:35.786
Tell me the truth.

33:42.289 --> 33:43.889
I killed one of them.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.591
My brother.

33:50.492 --> 33:52.693
They killed my wife and daughter.

33:55.995 --> 33:58.996
They broke into the basement
where they were hiding.

34:00.197 --> 34:02.398
My wife tried to defend
what little food we had.

34:04.099 --> 34:05.599
And they killed her.

34:08.199 --> 34:10.100
I came back from a water run

34:10.101 --> 34:12.202
and found them carrying
boxes to their van.

34:13.303 --> 34:14.402
And I just hid.

34:16.804 --> 34:18.905
I remember her wiping
blood on her pants.

34:20.005 --> 34:21.106
Him

34:21.406 --> 34:22.507
eating our food.

34:24.007 --> 34:25.007
And their brother

34:26.708 --> 34:28.909
bragging about what he'd just done.

34:33.712 --> 34:35.012
Thought I'd never see him again.

34:35.913 --> 34:37.213
Then, a couple of days ago,

34:37.714 --> 34:40.715
I'm riding in a bunker on
the coast and I hear a voice.

34:41.815 --> 34:43.016
Their brother's.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.018
I killed him whilst he slept.

34:49.418 --> 34:50.418
Then ran.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.821
They've been chasing me ever since.

34:56.722 --> 34:58.023
And your daughter?

35:02.425 --> 35:03.825
They got her, too.

35:31.438 --> 35:34.838
How do you know he isn't making
up stories to make you feel sorry for him?

35:34.839 --> 35:35.940
Tom...

35:36.640 --> 35:38.741
<i>Was he in the picture he showed you?</i>

35:40.042 --> 35:41.802
- No.
- Then you don't know for sure, do you?

35:43.243 --> 35:44.444
He saved my life.

35:45.144 --> 35:48.245
Maybe he plays the good
guy till he's done with the people outside.

35:49.846 --> 35:51.546
Look, we're all in this together.

35:51.547 --> 35:54.148
I'm just saying we
should watch our backs.

35:55.148 --> 35:58.049
He killed a man before your eyes, how do
you know he's not gonna kill us, too?

35:58.050 --> 36:00.851
How can you judge him so harshly
you can't even see him?

36:03.752 --> 36:04.853
I'm sorry.

36:05.153 --> 36:06.354
I didn't mean it.

36:06.954 --> 36:08.454
That's another five.

36:09.655 --> 36:10.655
Mediocre shot.

36:26.162 --> 36:27.563
That's a nice radio.

36:30.664 --> 36:32.665
Who taught you how to use it?

36:35.567 --> 36:36.567
My father.

36:39.769 --> 36:42.269
Your father sounds like
quite the survivalist.

36:42.270 --> 36:43.770
He didn't...

36:45.871 --> 36:47.972
He doesn't like to
take things for granted.

36:49.773 --> 36:52.474
He would always be
prepared if we went to ship.

36:55.876 --> 36:58.276
Did you get your electricity
from the solar power?

36:58.277 --> 37:01.678
Some. But we save
the batteries for the radio.

37:08.381 --> 37:09.781
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

37:09.782 --> 37:10.983
<i>Your men will live.</i>

37:11.683 --> 37:13.184
<i>They keep doing alright.</i>

37:13.684 --> 37:15.785
<i>This usually means you're OK.</i>

37:17.686 --> 37:22.887
<i>An unusually big swarm has been
spotted over Bradford heading south.</i>

37:22.888 --> 37:29.190
<i>I repeat. An unusually big swarm has been
spotted over Bradford heading south.</i>

37:29.191 --> 37:31.791
<i>They're three quarters advanced.</i>

37:31.792 --> 37:33.193
They're heading our way.

37:34.793 --> 37:36.893
They've been acting
strangely lately.

37:36.894 --> 37:38.294
What do you mean?

37:38.295 --> 37:40.396
Their patterns have changed.

37:40.996 --> 37:42.797
They'd been drilling like crazy.

37:43.597 --> 37:45.298
Like there's no tomorrow.

37:46.499 --> 37:47.499
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>

37:51.001 --> 37:52.001
<i>Don't come back</i>

37:52.401 --> 37:54.102
<i>it's too risky at the moment.</i>

38:26.617 --> 38:29.218
Tom, why don't you fetch
this bowl of mine?

38:30.218 --> 38:33.320
After all, it's been a long
time since we've had a guest.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.521
Sure.

38:44.725 --> 38:45.825
I'm sorry.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.126
I didn't mean to intrude.

38:56.130 --> 38:57.731
When did Tom lose his sight?

38:59.731 --> 39:01.732
He was flash blinded
the day they came.

39:04.834 --> 39:07.635
He was outside feeding
cattle with mum.

39:09.236 --> 39:11.137
All he remembers is this

39:12.037 --> 39:13.138
intense light

39:14.438 --> 39:16.139
telling him to run away.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.142
She died.

39:23.642 --> 39:25.643
It was the last thing he saw.

39:28.745 --> 39:29.945
And your father?

39:31.746 --> 39:32.946
I saw his grave.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.349
They got him, didn't they?

39:41.050 --> 39:43.551
I saw a blast a distance
a couple of days ago.

39:46.453 --> 39:48.353
Is that why you came here?

39:49.454 --> 39:51.355
I was hoping to find people.

39:51.655 --> 39:52.754
Life.

39:52.755 --> 39:55.056
Yeah, and you've left them to us.

39:56.157 --> 39:57.958
I didn't know they were following me.

40:00.359 --> 40:01.359
I'm sorry.

40:07.562 --> 40:08.763
Tom needs to know.

40:09.963 --> 40:12.263
The longer you wait,
the harder it's going to be.

40:12.264 --> 40:14.365
You know what? This is
none of your business.

40:14.665 --> 40:18.567
So you're gonna keep lying to him?
Give him false hope?

40:25.770 --> 40:28.271
Sorry. It's burnt.

40:28.571 --> 40:29.972
We ran out of oil.

40:44.279 --> 40:45.279
Hello?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.581
<i>What's happened to my husband?</i>

40:51.382 --> 40:52.582
<i>Did you kill him?</i>

40:55.183 --> 40:56.284
<i>Well?</i>

41:02.887 --> 41:06.087
<i>There's been enough
bloodshed as it is.</i>

41:06.088 --> 41:08.289
<i>Release your prisoner
and we'll be square.</i>

41:11.691 --> 41:12.691
He's gone.

41:14.292 --> 41:15.292
<i>You're lying.</i>

41:16.093 --> 41:17.093
I'm not.

41:17.593 --> 41:19.895
He cut his ties and escaped.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.496
When?

41:25.397 --> 41:27.798
A couple of hours ago.
He's probably dead by now.

41:28.698 --> 41:31.500
If not, the survival blankets
won't protect him for long.

41:34.801 --> 41:36.902
What did you do with
my husband's body?

41:40.704 --> 41:42.004
He's still with us.

41:45.306 --> 41:48.407
Take him down at sunset
so we can have a Christian burial.

41:49.608 --> 41:51.509
We'll leave the house
as soon as it's done.

41:52.109 --> 41:53.510
<i>You have our word.</i>

41:53.910 --> 41:54.910
<i>Over.</i>

42:07.916 --> 42:09.217
What do you think?

42:09.917 --> 42:11.618
I wouldn't believe them.

42:12.218 --> 42:14.319
She should be allowed
to bury her husband.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.121
That's not what they want him for.

42:20.822 --> 42:22.022
What do you mean?

42:22.823 --> 42:24.324
Well, they need to eat to survive.

42:38.430 --> 42:39.730
And what about you?

42:40.931 --> 42:42.932
Have you been eating
dead people, too?

42:46.333 --> 42:47.434
Of course not.

42:58.039 --> 42:59.839
They gave us their word.

43:00.140 --> 43:01.340
It means nothing.

43:01.740 --> 43:04.741
It's worth taking a chance.
They might go away.

43:04.742 --> 43:06.542
If what I think
will happen happens,

43:06.843 --> 43:08.742
they will be able to
stay out there for days

43:08.743 --> 43:11.645
while we're stuck in here
with no food or water.

43:13.846 --> 43:15.447
What do you think, Tom?

43:17.748 --> 43:19.648
I think you need to leave.

43:19.949 --> 43:22.150
- Tom!
- If he left, they'd go!

43:22.550 --> 43:23.949
No, they wouldn't.

43:23.950 --> 43:26.051
They'd come back for the farm.

43:26.952 --> 43:28.152
We need his help.

43:28.652 --> 43:30.053
We were fine before he turned up!

43:30.453 --> 43:32.954
<i>He wouldn't make it
out there by himself.</i>

43:34.055 --> 43:35.756
<i>I don't care if he dies.</i>

43:41.358 --> 43:42.459
Um...

43:42.859 --> 43:44.660
I'm sor-he didn't mean that.

44:11.172 --> 44:12.272
Are they back?

44:12.672 --> 44:13.673
Yeah.

44:14.473 --> 44:15.473
She'll call.

44:20.976 --> 44:22.076
Ok.

44:23.677 --> 44:25.178
Will you come with me?

44:32.781 --> 44:34.282
Back in a minute, Ok?

44:49.489 --> 44:51.090
Ok. Ok.

45:35.910 --> 45:37.110
We'll be alright.

46:58.447 --> 46:59.547
You alright?

47:02.549 --> 47:04.349
Dad should be back by now.

47:25.259 --> 47:27.460
They thought they
could contain him.

47:27.860 --> 47:30.561
If we were without our
satellites we were dine for.

47:31.862 --> 47:32.862
The heat.

47:33.162 --> 47:34.263
Snow.

47:35.563 --> 47:37.464
A stench of decaying flesh.

47:39.765 --> 47:41.566
There are no words for it.

47:42.667 --> 47:45.168
And soon we'll have no
newspapers to send them to.

47:46.668 --> 47:50.170
So I got back in the car,
drove home faster than I could.

47:51.070 --> 47:53.071
Is there anyone left in cities?

47:54.072 --> 47:55.072
No.

47:56.273 --> 47:58.374
The blasters didn't
leave them a chance.

48:01.075 --> 48:03.775
The old fire blankets,
the solar panels,

48:03.776 --> 48:05.677
that just drops in the ocean.

48:06.477 --> 48:10.179
And those who you
love survive to become animals.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.681
They hide in basements or bunkers.

48:16.182 --> 48:18.583
They get sick or lose their minds.

48:23.485 --> 48:26.986
Have you heard of anyone
actually making contact with them?

48:26.987 --> 48:29.088
No. Never.

48:30.188 --> 48:31.989
Well, maybe there isn't anyone.

48:32.289 --> 48:34.490
Maybe they just sent the machines.

48:34.890 --> 48:36.991
Or maybe they just
don't give a shit about us.

48:37.591 --> 48:41.392
Is that what you believe?
That they don't care?

48:41.393 --> 48:43.193
Why would they?

48:43.194 --> 48:45.394
<i>What makes us more special then the</i>

48:45.395 --> 48:48.895
ants or... field mice
or dolphins?

48:48.896 --> 48:50.896
Our art?

48:50.897 --> 48:54.799
Our ability to build,
to think about our life in sequences?

48:55.099 --> 48:58.201
Hence build completely
sophisticated colonies.

48:58.501 --> 49:00.102
Birds decorate their nests,

49:00.502 --> 49:02.001
Yeah, but they don't...

49:02.002 --> 49:04.604
regret, they don't dream,
they don't hope.

49:06.304 --> 49:07.305
Maybe they do.

49:07.605 --> 49:08.905
Maybe they don't.

49:11.507 --> 49:13.508
It's probably for the best.

49:14.608 --> 49:16.609
It won't get hard that way.

49:20.511 --> 49:21.511
Tom...

49:22.111 --> 49:24.211
Uh... why don't you
play something for us?

49:24.212 --> 49:25.813
I don't feel like it.

49:26.713 --> 49:28.714
Come on, do it for me.

49:33.617 --> 49:35.117
What should I play?

49:36.118 --> 49:38.519
What you were playing
over the radio.

51:38.773 --> 51:39.773
Hello?

51:45.376 --> 51:46.476
You Ok?

51:52.879 --> 51:54.080
Yeah, I'm fine.

52:02.484 --> 52:03.684
You can come in.

52:20.191 --> 52:21.792
What did you study?

52:23.693 --> 52:24.894
Veterinary medicine.

52:25.994 --> 52:26.995
First year.

52:29.496 --> 52:31.697
It doesn't matter now,
though, does it?

52:33.097 --> 52:35.398
You could have studied
English lit, like me.

52:36.599 --> 52:39.400
Believe me. You won't
want me sewing your leg up.

52:44.803 --> 52:46.803
What happened to your father?

52:53.707 --> 52:54.707
I found him.

52:56.108 --> 52:57.308
Yesterday morning.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.710
A few yards from here.

53:05.512 --> 53:07.112
He must've been...

53:07.113 --> 53:08.513
confused.

53:09.013 --> 53:12.015
Maybe his watch stopped, or something.

53:15.016 --> 53:16.017
When he left,

53:18.218 --> 53:20.118
I vaguely remember waking up

53:21.819 --> 53:25.421
remembering I'd forgotten to
turn off the alarm the night before,

53:28.622 --> 53:31.424
telling myself every
way it hadn't rung.

53:33.024 --> 53:35.525
I'd just go straight back to sleep.

53:40.528 --> 53:44.329
<i>And when my alarm did go off
a few minutes later,</i>

53:46.130 --> 53:47.231
I got out,

53:48.631 --> 53:52.333
and I saw his bike
leaning against a tree.

53:57.535 --> 53:59.636
And you really think it was a mistake?

54:04.839 --> 54:06.339
What are you saying?

54:08.640 --> 54:09.741
Maybe...

54:10.241 --> 54:12.442
he just wanted to
get it over with.

54:18.245 --> 54:19.345
No...

54:20.346 --> 54:22.046
No, my father was a fighter.

54:23.247 --> 54:25.748
He kept saying that
we had to keep going.

54:26.048 --> 54:28.049
That we could never give up...
he wouldn't...

54:28.649 --> 54:29.849
Never...

54:29.850 --> 54:31.851
In this world,

54:34.452 --> 54:35.953
people change.

54:39.154 --> 54:41.055
It was a mistake, Ok?

54:43.256 --> 54:45.357
My father wasn't a coward.

54:47.458 --> 54:51.259
He would... never have
abandoned us like that.

54:52.260 --> 54:55.461
He knew I couldn't protect him alone.

54:55.862 --> 54:57.962
<i>Or maybe he knew you could.</i>

54:58.763 --> 55:00.764
Maybe he thought you
were stronger than him.

55:02.565 --> 55:04.065
<i>You are, Sarah.</i>

55:07.367 --> 55:09.568
You're stronger than you think.

56:35.907 --> 56:38.308
Where were you
when all this started?

56:44.610 --> 56:47.612
Just... grocery shopping with my wife.

56:50.713 --> 56:52.214
We were bickering

56:53.514 --> 56:55.715
because I was wasting
money on expensive food and

56:56.516 --> 56:59.817
she was trying to save a few in the summer.

57:03.519 --> 57:05.420
Sounds trivial, doesn't it?

57:08.921 --> 57:10.322
What was her name?

57:14.324 --> 57:15.424
Lisa.

57:20.026 --> 57:21.927
Our daughter's name was Marty.

57:27.029 --> 57:29.331
She was such a lively
little girl. She was.

57:29.631 --> 57:30.631
Dancing around.

57:33.232 --> 57:35.533
Lisa said she could
become a ballerina.

57:39.435 --> 57:41.636
And I remember the last
night before I left them.

57:43.937 --> 57:45.038
Marty woke up.

57:47.139 --> 57:48.539
She wanted to come with me.

57:52.041 --> 57:54.742
She wouldn't let go
of my hands, as if

57:55.142 --> 57:56.843
somehow she knew.

58:31.959 --> 58:32.959
Sarah?

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:54.750
Nooooo!

01:01:58.752 --> 01:01:59.752
No...

01:02:01.753 --> 01:02:02.753
No!

01:03:40.297 --> 01:03:41.298
Oh, shit.

01:03:50.802 --> 01:03:51.803
Tom?!

01:03:58.105 --> 01:03:59.106
Tom?

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.310
Tom!

01:04:14.413 --> 01:04:15.413
Tom?

01:04:16.514 --> 01:04:17.614
Tom?

01:04:24.317 --> 01:04:25.918
No... he wouldn't have.

01:04:27.519 --> 01:04:28.519
No!

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.620
There were too many patrols around.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.521
He's all I have left!

01:04:40.524 --> 01:04:41.625
Tom!

01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:50.029
Tom!

01:05:19.542 --> 01:05:20.542
Tom!!

01:05:22.043 --> 01:05:23.044
Tom!

01:05:25.044 --> 01:05:26.145
What?

01:05:26.845 --> 01:05:28.246
They burned the straw.

01:05:30.647 --> 01:05:32.148
They're still here.

01:05:32.648 --> 01:05:33.948
Go! Go.

01:06:17.268 --> 01:06:18.468
What are you doing?

01:06:18.469 --> 01:06:21.270
There is no asbestos.
We'll be fine.

01:07:12.093 --> 01:07:13.193
Tom!

01:07:34.603 --> 01:07:35.803
Sarah! Hey!

01:07:37.904 --> 01:07:38.905
Tom's alive.

01:07:39.605 --> 01:07:40.605
Ok?

01:07:42.206 --> 01:07:43.707
Wait. I heard laughing.

01:07:57.613 --> 01:07:59.314
They're in the cellar.

01:08:27.926 --> 01:08:29.027
You alright?

01:08:30.328 --> 01:08:32.029
<i>We need to get him out.</i>

01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.430
I'll take him by surprise.

01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:50.136
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:08:52.438 --> 01:08:55.139
<i>He'll sniff them out.</i>

01:11:52.319 --> 01:11:53.319
<i>Tom?</i>

01:11:54.019 --> 01:11:55.020
<i>Tom.</i>

01:11:56.621 --> 01:11:59.122
<i>Tom, Tom.</i>

01:12:00.923 --> 01:12:02.023
<i>It's me.</i>

01:12:54.547 --> 01:12:55.547
Come on.

01:13:36.766 --> 01:13:38.266
Stay here, Ok?

01:14:00.376 --> 01:14:01.377
She's not here.

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:15.883
I guess they've gone.

01:14:21.886 --> 01:14:22.986
Tom?

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:43.696
Get up!

01:14:45.597 --> 01:14:47.097
Come over here, boy.

01:14:56.201 --> 01:14:57.802
Why did you shoot him?

01:14:58.302 --> 01:14:59.603
There was no need.

01:15:00.303 --> 01:15:01.504
He killed my brother.

01:15:02.004 --> 01:15:03.405
You killed his wife.

01:15:03.705 --> 01:15:04.805
No...

01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:07.306
They were already dead.

01:15:07.606 --> 01:15:10.207
His wife ran to a
death with their child.

01:15:10.208 --> 01:15:11.808
She just couldn't take it anymore.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:17.411
We found him scavenging
for tomatoes in the garden.

01:15:18.511 --> 01:15:20.212
Took them back to her bunker.

01:15:21.013 --> 01:15:23.012
I guess we didn't agree on

01:15:23.013 --> 01:15:24.614
what we had to do to survive.

01:15:28.316 --> 01:15:29.416
You were wrong.

01:15:30.217 --> 01:15:33.118
And because you wouldn't
listen, you got my husband killed.

01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:38.020
He tried to rape me.

01:15:40.321 --> 01:15:41.822
I don't believe you.

01:16:00.330 --> 01:16:03.031
<i>It's time for this to end.</i>

01:17:01.758 --> 01:17:03.359
You're going to be Ok.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.861
I just needed you to trust me.

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:41.876
We need to go.

01:17:46.978 --> 01:17:48.579
Come back when it's safe.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.301
I didn't mean what I said about Jude.

01:18:39.902 --> 01:18:40.902
I know.

01:19:05.714 --> 01:19:07.414
<i>What now?</i>

01:20:21.848 --> 01:20:24.349
Are you sure this is what you want?

01:20:36.955 --> 01:20:38.055
Stop!

01:20:45.959 --> 01:20:47.359
Maybe we should wait.

01:21:44.485 --> 01:21:45.786
What happened?

01:21:51.288 --> 01:21:52.389
They're gone.

01:22:07.896 --> 01:22:10.197
They left the same way they came.

01:22:12.297 --> 01:22:13.598
Without warning.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:21.100
Dad used to say as long as
there's hope in our hearts,

01:22:21.101 --> 01:22:22.402
we'd survive.

01:22:25.804 --> 01:22:27.504
He was right.
