WEBVTT

00:08.182 --> 00:09.661
- Yeah, um...

00:09.705 --> 00:12.621
Over the last couple of months,
my love life has been,

00:12.664 --> 00:14.971
well, a whirlwind.

00:15.015 --> 00:19.671
Simon, my fiance,
is a sweet gentleman,

00:19.715 --> 00:22.283
who has only eyes
for Porsha.

00:22.326 --> 00:24.241
- This man is married
and got engaged

00:24.285 --> 00:25.808
to another woman
at the same time.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.115
If that ain't a player, I don't
know what you call that.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.291
- The last time
you guys saw me,

00:30.334 --> 00:33.294
I was ending things
for good with PJ's father.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.209
A couple of months
after that,

00:35.252 --> 00:37.515
I met the man
of my dreams,

00:37.559 --> 00:39.126
Simon Guobadia,

00:39.169 --> 00:41.998
but things haven't been
so perfect for us

00:42.042 --> 00:44.696
thanks to social media.

00:49.788 --> 00:52.530
I had no idea
that the timeline

00:52.574 --> 00:55.011
was such a mind
for the public, okay?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.013
- My first thought was,
oh, crap,

00:57.057 --> 00:58.493
this is not
gonna be good.

00:58.536 --> 01:01.017
- They were saying that
she was a husband snatcher.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.107
- What people were saying
was so vicious

01:04.151 --> 01:07.850
as if they know
these things as fact.

01:07.893 --> 01:10.853
- The engagement
happening too fast

01:10.896 --> 01:12.681
is nobody's damn business.

01:12.724 --> 01:15.205
- Simon is at the tail end
of his divorce.

01:15.249 --> 01:18.034
Supposed to
be over but...

01:18.078 --> 01:19.470
got some things
to take care of.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.864
- All we were waiting for
at this point,

01:21.907 --> 01:23.257
is the stroke of a pen.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.346
Here is a divorce decree.

01:25.389 --> 01:26.912
- We got engaged
on a Thursday,

01:26.956 --> 01:30.264
and Simon and I thought that
the judge was going to stamp

01:30.307 --> 01:33.441
and finalize it on
that Friday.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.052
Monday came.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.186
It was not done,
and the picture was out there,

01:39.229 --> 01:42.102
and now people are saying
that I am with a married man,

01:42.145 --> 01:44.147
and it's like I know
what's true.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.583
I know what's not true.

01:45.627 --> 01:48.412
I just had to bear
and go with the decision

01:48.456 --> 01:51.763
that I had made,
and that was to be engaged.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.070
- Would Porsha knowingly
steal a woman husband?

01:54.114 --> 01:57.378
I mean...
- Absolutely not.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.206
- everybody.
what they got to say.

01:59.249 --> 02:02.078
My focus is to blend
our families together,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.254
and I'm going to do
whatever it takes

02:04.298 --> 02:06.082
to make sure
that happens,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.171
no matter who
gets in my way.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.871
- Yes!

02:12.915 --> 02:14.656
My family!

02:39.985 --> 02:41.204
♪ Give me that money

02:41.248 --> 02:42.945
♪ give give give me
that money ♪

02:42.988 --> 02:44.207
♪ give me that money

02:44.251 --> 02:45.948
♪ give me that
that money ♪

02:45.991 --> 02:47.123
♪ give me that money

02:47.167 --> 02:48.559
♪ give give give me
that money ♪

02:48.603 --> 02:50.822
- So, what do you think
about the neighborhood?

02:50.866 --> 02:52.128
- I love this area.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.651
I have always
loved this area.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.654
It's so quiet, peaceful.

02:56.698 --> 03:00.092
My fiance,
Simon Iyore Guobadia,

03:00.136 --> 03:01.964
is everything.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.270
- I'm an entrepreneur.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.228
I own several businesses.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.970
I'm in a restaurant
and night clubs.

03:08.013 --> 03:09.450
- Simon and I
met, actually,

03:09.493 --> 03:10.799
because he had DM'd me.

03:10.842 --> 03:12.496
That's what I think.

03:12.540 --> 03:14.629
Now, y'all tell me he's telling
y'all somethin' different, okay?

03:16.326 --> 03:20.287
- My relationship with Porsha
started after my ex-wife and I

03:20.330 --> 03:22.289
announced that we were
getting divorced.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.987
Porsha reached out
in DM and expressed

03:25.030 --> 03:26.684
that she was sorry
to hear that.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.686
Her DMing me,
checking up on me,

03:28.730 --> 03:31.428
making sure I was okay,
I appreciated it,

03:31.472 --> 03:34.475
and the rest of it
is history.

03:34.518 --> 03:36.041
I think we're right back
by my house.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.347
- Oh, yeah, came
right back by your house.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.002
- Yeah.
- Well, what the hell?

03:40.045 --> 03:41.221
Have you thought
about the fact

03:41.264 --> 03:43.310
that you have so many cars
just for you?

03:43.353 --> 03:44.876
- Me?
- Yeah.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.269
How many cars do you own?

03:46.313 --> 03:49.577
- I have two
Rolls Royces here,

03:49.620 --> 03:51.056
one '63.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.145
- Five-- five cars here, right?
- I have five cars?

03:53.189 --> 03:54.190
- You don't even know.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.409
Okay, whatever.
- Yeah.

03:55.452 --> 03:56.845
- So, you have about
five cars yourself.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.063
- Mm-hmm.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.717
- What about when
the kids get older?

03:59.761 --> 04:01.502
Where are they gonna
have their cars?

04:01.545 --> 04:03.243
- No, they're moving out.
If you can own a car,

04:03.286 --> 04:04.331
you should have
your own apartment.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.506
- What?
- Yeah.

04:05.549 --> 04:07.725
- Pilar is not
going anywhere.

04:07.769 --> 04:08.770
- We're getting married.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.511
We're consolidating
households.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.730
Hey, I'm glad you know
you're not bringing the king

04:12.774 --> 04:13.905
into the queen's palace.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.342
- Oh!

04:15.385 --> 04:17.431
That just gave you
one more point, huh?

04:17.474 --> 04:19.128
You know you be
racking 'em up.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.173
You act so chill
and cool,

04:21.217 --> 04:22.566
but you be
racking 'em up.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.745
Hmm, okay.

04:27.789 --> 04:31.053
- Let's go look at
this beautiful home.

04:31.096 --> 04:32.097
Hello.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.535
- Hi. How are you?
- How are you?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.232
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.320
- Good.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.582
- You guys come on in.
- Okay.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.108
- So, here we have
a two-story great room.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.371
- I love that.
- Yeah.

04:44.414 --> 04:46.329
- I'm all about
a two-story great room.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.288
- Of course, you see it
has a modern feel,

04:48.331 --> 04:51.203
floor to ceiling windows,
seven bedrooms,

04:51.247 --> 04:53.467
and beautiful views
of the pool.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.905
- Have you identified
which room for which kid?

04:56.948 --> 04:58.907
We have six.
- Well...

04:58.950 --> 05:00.300
- Wow.

05:00.343 --> 05:01.431
So, a seven bedroom is
a good bedroom count then.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.432
- It is.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.738
It is a good
bedroom count.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.261
- Well, why don't I give
you all a little time

05:05.305 --> 05:06.262
to kinda talk
things through?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.524
- Okay.

05:07.568 --> 05:08.482
- And I'll be here if you
have any questions.

05:08.525 --> 05:09.265
- Absolutely.
- Okay, perfect.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.571
- Okay.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.095
- Okay, them little steps.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.097
- Oh, yes, my quads
are workin'.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.360
- That's some work.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.666
- So, what are
you thinking?

05:18.709 --> 05:19.928
- You don't seem like
you wanna look around

05:19.971 --> 05:21.495
this house anymore.
You're done seeing it.

05:21.538 --> 05:22.670
- Well, it's
a beautiful home.

05:22.713 --> 05:23.888
- Yeah.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.107
- I think one of the
things you noticed,

05:25.150 --> 05:26.674
is that it might be
just good enough

05:26.717 --> 05:28.415
for one or two people.
- Yeah.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.373
I mean, I'm just
thinking about I like

05:30.417 --> 05:32.375
the openness of this one,

05:32.419 --> 05:35.378
but with all
these kids and us,

05:35.422 --> 05:37.293
and we want some walls.
- Yeah.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.642
I have five kids.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.949
I obviously have
been married,

05:40.992 --> 05:42.254
you know,
a few times.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.387
This is gonna be
my fourth marriage,

05:44.431 --> 05:48.565
and kids are typically
involved with each divorce.

05:48.609 --> 05:51.220
Co-parenting is not
a easy thing to do.

05:51.263 --> 05:53.440
- The house in Costa Rica
has me spoiled.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.572
Like, I want that vibe.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.792
It has to have
that umph.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.360
Like, when you walk in
the door, it's like bam.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.753
- That's right.
- I'm the Guobadia house.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.059
You know what I'm saying?
- Oh, baby.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.365
- And the kitchen has be--
oh, you like that?

06:05.408 --> 06:06.583
- So sexy.
Do that again.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.671
- You like that boom-boom.
- One more time.

06:07.715 --> 06:08.585
One more time.
- Outta your house.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.457
- Ooh, love it.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.024
- And then I also feel like
you're not thinking about

06:13.068 --> 06:15.157
the other kids.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.376
- Who?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.420
- The ones that are
still in your balls.

06:19.422 --> 06:20.989
When I told my sister
I was moving to Atlanta,

06:21.032 --> 06:23.165
she was like, "What?"

06:23.208 --> 06:26.342
Nobody has been able to
get me to move from Duluth.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.257
My home for me has been
a manifestation

06:28.300 --> 06:29.780
of my independence,

06:29.824 --> 06:32.696
me working hard, being able
to afford a home like this

06:32.740 --> 06:36.396
in a gated community,
raising my daughter on my own.

06:36.439 --> 06:39.442
It has been
very fulfilling to me.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.836
It does feel like I'm leaving
a piece of Porsha.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.839
I looked on Twitter,
and I saw Kordell

06:44.882 --> 06:46.493
filing for divorce
from Porsha.

06:46.536 --> 06:47.668
- You really found out
about it on Twitter?

06:47.711 --> 06:48.843
- Completely blindsided.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.410
- You didn't do
anything wrong.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.238
He just was
the wrong damn one.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.718
- You're right.

06:55.763 --> 06:56.677
- Pretty.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.027
- Welcome to
my humble abode.

06:59.070 --> 07:02.552
This move for me is
a "believe in Porsha" move.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.381
At the end of the day,
if I end out on my ass,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.817
it'll be because of me.

07:06.861 --> 07:07.949
It won't be because Kordell
or some man kicked me

07:07.992 --> 07:09.472
out on my ass.
- Right.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.039
- I'm turning 40,
all right?

07:11.082 --> 07:12.344
I wanna move with Simon

07:12.388 --> 07:14.956
because I'm ready to
settle down, all right?

07:14.999 --> 07:16.566
Down not turn it up.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.395
All I was thinking was,
I just need to find the man

07:19.439 --> 07:21.528
and just, bloop,
pluck him into the house.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.965
- A man like me, you can't
just pick him

07:24.008 --> 07:25.662
and pluck him in there.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.359
- My house I just don't
think you're comfortable

07:27.403 --> 07:28.448
being over there
like that.

07:28.491 --> 07:29.884
- Uh-uh.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.189
- Why not?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.713
- Just the same reason
you're not comfortable

07:32.756 --> 07:34.497
with being at my house.
- Really?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.064
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.848
- Hi!
- Hi!

07:37.892 --> 07:39.371
- Hi, ladies. How are you?
- Hey.

07:39.415 --> 07:42.070
- This is my husband,
Simon, everyone.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.419
- How are you? You're good?
- How are you? I'm well.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.725
- Boom-boom.

07:44.768 --> 07:45.552
Boom-boom.

07:45.595 --> 07:46.770
- Boom-boom.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.380
- But here's the thing
about my house.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.034
Nobody has-- oh, I was about
to say nobody lived in there.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.253
- Yeah, somebody else has
lived there before.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.254
- Someone did.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.560
Do you like this?
- Yeah.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.039
That one got the tail
on it, too?

07:56.998 --> 08:00.001
Why are you always looking
for the tail?

08:00.044 --> 08:02.612
- Somebody has, you know,
marked their territory

08:02.656 --> 08:04.266
there at one point.

08:04.309 --> 08:05.746
- Oh.
- So, tainted.

08:39.649 --> 08:42.043
- Hey, my baby.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.218
Muah.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.045
She gonna talk
about somethin'.

08:44.088 --> 08:44.524
She want ice cream.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.353
- Oh, God, listen.
- What's up? How you doin'?

08:48.397 --> 08:50.486
- Good. Just fine.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.837
My relationship with
Dennis is still loving.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.665
Nothing like that
has changed.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.362
The only thing that's changed
is his relationship

08:57.406 --> 08:58.494
with my daughter.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.713
We will always
be friends.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.585
We will always consider
ourselves family.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.152
- Where Porsha at?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.980
- Um...

09:11.986 --> 09:15.163
- They are lookin'
at houses today.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.773
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.514
- You know,
Porsha moves fast.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.995
We broke up July 2020,
but, you know, Christmas,

09:21.038 --> 09:23.563
she bought us damn
matching pajamas.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.652
Y'all seen that sh--.

09:25.695 --> 09:29.830
Porsha asked me for her ring
back around Christmas,

09:29.873 --> 09:32.528
but we had too much stuff
that wasn't worked out.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.834
She didn't like
that answer.

09:33.877 --> 09:36.184
Next thing I know,
she was engaged again.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.316
We still gotta have
our little-- little talk,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.014
you know?
- Mm-hmm.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.886
- I have to talk to Dennis
about the moving in.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.801
I'm sure it's--
I mean, we're engaged.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.717
I'm sure that he knows
it's inevitable.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.546
I told him he could come
to the party tomorrow.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.634
- Okay.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
- I did text him
and tell him that

09:53.418 --> 09:55.769
I did not want him
to bring a date,

09:55.812 --> 09:59.250
and he, um,
did not like that.

10:02.253 --> 10:03.777
Coming up...

10:03.820 --> 10:04.734
- How long were y'all talking
before y'all were engaged?

10:04.778 --> 10:06.910
- Hmm, right at a month.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.129
- Yeah.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.347
- Porsha gonna look
like the man stealer

10:09.391 --> 10:10.653
of the century.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.220
She may go in the hall
of fame for that sh--,

10:12.263 --> 10:13.830
to be honest wit' you.

10:17.399 --> 10:19.575
- I did text him
and tell him that

10:19.619 --> 10:22.012
I did not want him
to bring a date,

10:22.056 --> 10:25.973
and he, um,
did not like that.

10:27.757 --> 10:28.976
- I'll tell ya.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.673
How about all these
birthday festivities?

10:30.717 --> 10:32.327
Aren't you coming
to somethin'?

10:32.370 --> 10:35.417
- Uh, no.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.462
- Oh, you're not coming.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.029
- I couldn't bring
a date, so...

10:39.073 --> 10:41.466
- Did she tell you couldn't
come with a date, Dennis?

10:41.510 --> 10:42.990
- That's what she said.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.644
I think it's fair to, you know,
since Porsha is engaged,

10:44.687 --> 10:48.909
it should be common courtesy
for me to bring a guest, too.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.954
- If it's somebody
that he wants to bring

10:50.998 --> 10:54.654
around my daughter, cool.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.177
Bring the heifer.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.049
But if you're just
bringing just anybody

10:59.093 --> 11:01.704
that you done met off
the street to come, like,

11:01.748 --> 11:05.142
'cause, "I can't come alone,"
then, no, you can't.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.189
- Sometimes people can't
take the same medicine

11:08.232 --> 11:09.669
that they give out.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.975
If Porsha sees me with a girl,
she's gonna be pissed.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.760
That's all
it is to it.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.675
- Yeah, I can't believe
our girl told you,

11:15.718 --> 11:17.024
you couldn't
bring no date.

11:18.547 --> 11:19.504
Uh-oh.

11:19.548 --> 11:20.723
- You never know.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.814
- Every other guest you invited
is a plus one,

11:24.858 --> 11:27.121
and if you're
inviting Dennis,

11:27.164 --> 11:29.819
he should have the benefit
of a plus one.

11:29.863 --> 11:32.430
- He can bring a homeboy.
- No.

11:34.998 --> 11:36.217
- What's wrong?
I don't-- I-I--

11:36.260 --> 11:37.958
maybe I am completely
blind by something.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.786
- Yes, you are.
- And I don't know.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.091
- Yes, you are.
You're blinded by--

11:41.135 --> 11:42.702
by some history.

11:42.745 --> 11:43.964
- What do you mean?

11:44.007 --> 11:46.488
- It sounds like there's
some parts about him

11:46.531 --> 11:47.794
you don't trust.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.709
- No, I don't not trust
what he's gonna do.

11:49.752 --> 11:53.060
I just feel like he
shouldn't bring a date.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.333
You ready to report
the 11 o'clock news?

12:06.813 --> 12:08.597
'Cause that's what I just
gave you right now.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.556
That's the--
- That wing-- that wing.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.732
- That-- I know.
There's that wing.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.864
That's that reporter wing.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.780
Hi.
- Hey, birthday girl.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.217
It's your birthday.
It's your birthday.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.655
- It's my birthday.
How often am I gonna be 40?

12:23.699 --> 12:27.572
I'm entering into
a brand-new number age.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.575
Forty is it,
all right? Trust me.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.969
I really can't say
I would change much,

12:33.013 --> 12:34.971
and that's not
a easy statement to say

12:35.015 --> 12:37.800
because I have definitely
had some hardships.

12:37.844 --> 12:41.282
He had no
factual reason

12:41.325 --> 12:42.762
to divorce me.

12:42.805 --> 12:43.937
I've definitely
had some downs.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.068
I've had some ups.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.461
Welcome to
my humble abode.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.768
- I love it.
- You love it?

12:48.811 --> 12:49.899
- It's so cute.

12:49.943 --> 12:52.423
- I'm pregnant.
- Yo.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.253
Would you like
to be Mrs. McKinley?

12:56.297 --> 12:57.472
- Yes.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.778
- You know,
I made a mistake.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.823
I cheated and-- and--
- It's not a mistake.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.739
I really do believe that
everything I've conquered

13:03.783 --> 13:04.958
in my life--

13:05.001 --> 13:08.657
Black lives matter!
- Black lives matter!

13:08.700 --> 13:11.529
- Has gotten me to right
where I am today.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.227
That looks perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

13:13.270 --> 13:14.968
- So, how do you feel
about going out with Simon

13:15.011 --> 13:17.100
in the public eye?

13:17.144 --> 13:20.408
- I mean, I will say this.
My people understand us.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.802
They know our whole
love story, everything.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.194
- Exactly.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.805
- But, I mean, you go
talkin' about having, like,

13:25.848 --> 13:27.676
this big birthday party,
and people are online

13:27.719 --> 13:29.286
talking about
"Kill yourself, bitch!"

13:30.374 --> 13:32.028
- Oh, my.

13:32.072 --> 13:35.118
- Social media right now
is pretty brutal.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.122
It's really hurtful
to hear people say

13:39.166 --> 13:41.081
these horrible things
about me

13:41.124 --> 13:43.126
knowing that
it's not true.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.475
At first, I was, like,
trying to tell Lauren,

13:44.519 --> 13:46.913
like, oh, let's just
do something small.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.175
- You were nervous.
I get it.

13:48.218 --> 13:48.871
- Yeah, I was
a little bit nervous.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.046
Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.265
- I think that the fact
that Simon and I

13:51.308 --> 13:53.528
were spending time
in Costa Rica,

13:53.571 --> 13:56.400
away from Atlanta,
it kinda had us in a bubble,

13:56.444 --> 13:59.360
and we haven't really been out
in Atlanta really together.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.842
So, yeah, this is
our coming out party.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.898
- Hey.
- Hi.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.334
Oh, my God, there's
so many screens.

14:17.378 --> 14:19.162
- I know. This place
is humongous.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.468
- It is.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.992
I employed Londie,
who is my creative cousin,

14:23.036 --> 14:26.866
to help us make this club
a Porsha Land.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.433
Literally, I told her
I want Porsha everywhere.

14:29.477 --> 14:33.046
Simon's job is to pay for it
and mine is to facilitate

14:33.089 --> 14:36.353
and be the liaison for
all the moving pieces.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.879
Oh! This is creepy.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.315
This is, like,
up her alley.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.535
If Porsha feels Beyonce
by Friday, then we're good.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.711
- Simon made a birthday post,
and it is so cute.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.844
- He did what?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.150
I don't even
have my phone.

14:50.193 --> 14:50.759
- You wanna read it?
You want me to read it?

14:51.934 --> 14:54.632
- No, Simon Guobadia!

14:55.895 --> 14:57.461
- First, that's only
one picture.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.464
That's the first picture.

15:04.686 --> 15:05.556
- Coming up...

15:07.471 --> 15:09.996
- He's gonna have to pull back
because you can't keep going on

15:10.039 --> 15:11.736
like you're doing either.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.087
- He just doesn't get that

15:14.130 --> 15:16.306
I now have anxiety.
You know what I'm saying?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.917
About all this.
- Yeah.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.965
- No, Simon Guobadia!

15:24.227 --> 15:25.794
- First, that's only
one picture.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.970
That's the first picture.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.628
- I love his post.
It's very sweet.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.065
I love the caption.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.632
Didn't love
the picture so much

15:37.675 --> 15:41.984
because he combined
a collage of moments

15:42.028 --> 15:44.639
that I wanted to
keep 'em private.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.032
Go to the next slide.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.384
Oh, my God!

15:50.427 --> 15:52.125
I do share
a lot on Instagram,

15:52.168 --> 15:54.170
but it was those pictures
in particular

15:54.214 --> 15:57.130
that I had actually said
we're not gonna post these,

15:57.173 --> 15:59.262
but he decided
to share them.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.786
- But look who has
already liked it.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.658
Dennis.

16:03.701 --> 16:07.357
- Simon seems like, you know,
he's pretty even keel,

16:07.401 --> 16:10.012
but I feel like
some of his posts

16:10.056 --> 16:13.059
can almost perpetuate
the-the hate and the--

16:13.102 --> 16:14.190
and the-and the things
like that,

16:14.234 --> 16:16.018
and I don't think
that he knows.

16:16.062 --> 16:19.152
When she posted the picture
of him and Dennis,

16:19.195 --> 16:20.892
their relationship,
everyone has their opinions

16:20.936 --> 16:22.590
about how it started,
how it happened,

16:22.633 --> 16:25.027
you know, the circumstances.
My first thing was,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.334
okay, let's just not do
any social media.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.249
When I saw the picture,
I was in shock.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.164
First thought,
she's the GOAT for this.

16:31.207 --> 16:33.862
Okay, like, women would dream
of blending their family

16:33.905 --> 16:35.255
that quickly,
all right?

16:35.298 --> 16:36.691
My second thought,
when everyone finds this out,

16:36.734 --> 16:39.041
they're not going to have
all the information you have,

16:39.085 --> 16:41.217
and she's gonna
suffer for it.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.871
Every time Simon posts,

16:42.914 --> 16:45.178
Porsha has to deal
with the backlash.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.484
- The trait of a man to
immediately go to social media

16:47.528 --> 16:49.182
is a bit interesting.
- I feel like he--

16:49.225 --> 16:51.923
he has to know
because it's hurting her.

16:51.967 --> 16:54.274
- It's not even Twitter.
It's Instagram.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.102
I feel like over 50,
it should be Twitter.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.061
- Hey, ladies.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.758
- Hey.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.021
- Hi.

17:02.064 --> 17:03.283
- You--
- Your club is awesome.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.893
- Thank you.
- Your club is beautiful.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.069
- This is really cool.
- Like, completely beautiful.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.375
Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.377
Good seeing you.
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.335
- Your fiance.
- Yes, yes.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.250
- Yes, she's--
she's everywhere in here.

17:14.294 --> 17:15.425
How are you?
- Hi, Lauren.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.905
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

17:16.948 --> 17:19.429
It's super awkward being
around Simon without Porsha

17:19.473 --> 17:21.953
because the only times
I've experienced him

17:21.997 --> 17:23.477
have been with
either Porsha

17:23.520 --> 17:25.740
or our entire family
is around.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.437
Hell, she's still trying
to get to know him.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.269
Um...

17:34.792 --> 17:35.880
I mean, he was married.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.927
So, that surprised me.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.234
- Oh, my. This transforms.
- Did you go see her earlier?

17:41.277 --> 17:43.105
- Yes, I did.
- What'd y'all do?

17:43.149 --> 17:44.933
- Dropped off her,
uh, presents.

17:44.976 --> 17:45.977
- Aww.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.805
- Look who was at the door.

17:47.849 --> 17:51.070
- Hi, Mom.
- And he came bearing
many gifts.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.942
Oh, I love it!
- You do?

17:53.985 --> 17:55.726
Some of them were
practical gifts.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.121
- Ooh.
- Do you like it?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.776
- This smells--
smell like money.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.256
Mmm.
- Mmm.

18:03.299 --> 18:05.649
Some were not so practical.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.869
But I know my girl.
I know what she likes.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.828
- We appreciate
you making her happy.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.658
- Hey, girl.
- Oh.

18:14.702 --> 18:18.401
- Mm-hmm. Hey.
- Oh, you look good.

18:18.445 --> 18:19.968
- You like it?
- Let me see this makeup.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.318
Oh, oh, that's gorgeous.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.798
- Well, you're all right,
aren't ya?

18:23.841 --> 18:25.452
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

18:25.495 --> 18:28.063
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
Lookin' down like that?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.935
- No, I just-- I don't wanna
make a big thing about it.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.328
- About what, boo?

18:32.372 --> 18:35.810
- Simon's post because
it's beautiful, of course.

18:35.853 --> 18:39.030
His caption is great,
but the whole thing is, like,

18:39.074 --> 18:41.642
you've still got
people who don't get

18:41.685 --> 18:44.210
him and I being together
because we're engaged,

18:44.253 --> 18:46.951
and his paperwork hasn't
been stamped by the judge.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.431
- Right.

18:48.475 --> 18:51.434
- So, you have people who
are really coming down hard

18:51.478 --> 18:53.349
on me about it
'cause I said to him,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.134
I said,
"I saw your post."

18:55.177 --> 18:56.831
I saw your post.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.094
- Did you like it?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.227
- And, you know, I don't even
know how to fake my face,

19:01.270 --> 19:02.576
so I didn't know
if I was giving him

19:02.619 --> 19:04.186
the, "I'm gonna
you up look,"

19:04.230 --> 19:06.014
or if I was
giving him the,

19:06.057 --> 19:07.537
"I saw your post."
- Yeah.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.931
I just didn't wanna put, uh,
put it all out there but--

19:09.974 --> 19:12.151
- I don't give-- I don't give
two-- two

19:12.194 --> 19:13.587
- I know you don't.
- Yeah.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.372
- So, I had told him,
you know, whatever you post,

19:16.416 --> 19:19.027
let me approve the pictures
and the caption first,

19:19.070 --> 19:21.377
but he decided
to share them.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.470
- Yeah, exactly.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.385
Hello.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.866
I'm the one been in the public
all this time. Come on.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.347
If I woulda said to him,
"I told you don't,"

19:34.390 --> 19:37.001
he woulda-- he could've
even probably cried.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.089
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause the--

19:38.133 --> 19:39.917
the last thing he wants
to do is--

19:39.961 --> 19:44.226
- I know. Mm-hmm.

19:44.270 --> 19:47.273
- But he doesn't--
he just doesn't get that

19:47.316 --> 19:51.277
I now have anxiety.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.278
You know what
I'm saying?

19:52.321 --> 19:53.627
About all this?
- Yeah.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.716
He-he just doesn't see
any wrong in what's doing

19:55.759 --> 19:58.371
because he thinks
he's letting the truth out.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.373
- He is.
- But he's gonna have
to pull back

20:00.416 --> 20:03.245
because you can't keep going on
like you're doing either.

20:03.289 --> 20:06.509
- I had felt like I was
on the road to people,

20:06.553 --> 20:08.729
like, getting me,
getting my heart,

20:08.772 --> 20:11.732
and then now it's, like,
completely upside down

20:11.775 --> 20:13.908
where people are
thinking one way,

20:13.951 --> 20:15.562
and it's really another.

20:15.605 --> 20:17.694
It's my birthday, and I
feel like I'm supposed to,

20:17.738 --> 20:22.264
like, be, you know, how--
how I normally am for everybody.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.613
So, now it's different.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.180
Now, I gotta
put myself stage,

20:25.224 --> 20:29.010
and I don't even really want
nobody to be looking at me.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.578
- But you don't want to
get a point where you feel

20:31.621 --> 20:34.102
like you're fighting them,

20:34.145 --> 20:35.973
the few naysayers
that are out there,

20:36.017 --> 20:38.411
and you don't wanna get
to where you're resenting

20:38.454 --> 20:40.413
or can't be
honest with him.

20:40.456 --> 20:41.588
I see your heart.

20:41.631 --> 20:44.286
All I know,
is my daughter is happy.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.679
That's all I see.
- Mm-hmm.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.942
- And I want
you to stay happy.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.596
- I'm glad that I could
talk to you about it.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.598
I feel much better.
- Aww.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.164
- When I tell ya-- I couldn't
even damn breathe in here.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.688
- Girl.
- I was like, Lord Jesus,

20:54.731 --> 20:56.037
I ain't trying to go
to no party.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.256
- Aww.
- You know, if-- if I--

20:57.299 --> 20:58.692
it was my party,
I'd been done canceled it.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.389
- Oh, well, no,
give me some sugar.

21:00.433 --> 21:01.738
- But--
- It's gonna be all right.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.914
- I love you.
- I love you, too, honey.

21:05.525 --> 21:08.963
- Can I just talk to you
real quick about your post?

21:09.006 --> 21:10.225
- I was just playing.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.272
What I think and feel
about social media,

21:13.315 --> 21:14.795
I don't give a

21:21.323 --> 21:23.020
- We got the first one.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.848
- Let me see.
- Oh, let's see. Let's see.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.503
- Ooh, okay.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.462
- Do y'all like this?
- P.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.032
- Look at you, girl.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.730
- Booty, yes, oh, my God.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.340
- Look at you,
first of all.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.733
Don't come in here
comin' for me.

21:39.776 --> 21:43.476
- Uh-oh. Okay.
- Oh, wow. What?

21:43.519 --> 21:44.999
Her dress looks
similar to mine.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.392
Wait a minute.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.958
- Okay, let's try
dress number two.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.526
- Okay, yeah, let's try
dress number two. Okay.

21:50.570 --> 21:53.747
She is-- what are they--
63 and fabulous.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.663
Baby, killing it.
I pray for those genes.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.323
Hey, boo. Muah.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.715
- It's shot o'clock.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.238
Shot, shot.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.501
- Shot o'clock.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.372
- Cheers to Porsha.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.243
- Cheers.
- It's your birthday.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.680
Hey, hey, hey.

22:13.723 --> 22:15.508
- Yeah, you ready to go.
Let's go.

22:15.551 --> 22:17.379
Yeah, you're ready to go.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.076
Yes, okay.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.469
- We're gonna bring
the club here.
- Got you outside tonight.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.211
You're gonna catch you one.
I swear you will.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.389
- Now, see if you can get how
that table sit right there.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.173
We-we did
the table setting.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.480
Oww!

22:31.524 --> 22:32.960
Mama hot like fire.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.964
It's time to go, y'all.

22:37.007 --> 22:40.010
- Ooh, this is fancy.
It's like a big ol' limo.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.534
- Yes.

22:41.577 --> 22:44.232
- There he is!
- What's up, darling?

22:44.275 --> 22:45.364
- Hey, boo.

22:45.407 --> 22:46.756
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.541
- You're looking gorgeous.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.325
- You're looking
like a Black angel.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.545
- Hi.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.590
- Is Simon coming
on the bus?
- Yes.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.331
- Oh, so, yeah,
let them sit right there.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.811
- I'm here!

22:57.854 --> 23:01.336
- Hi, guys.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.946
- Turn up!
Turn up! Turn!

23:05.166 --> 23:06.036
- Lay down your phone.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.821
- What the hell?

23:07.864 --> 23:09.344
- What was that?
- And I saw it coming.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.650
I couldn't even move.
- That's a mother----in'
lawsuit.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.434
- That hit my foot.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.871
- It hit mine, too.

23:14.915 --> 23:17.265
- Ahh, this is
Dennis' bus.

23:17.308 --> 23:18.745
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

23:23.750 --> 23:27.101
- Chile, he can bring a date
if she look like a damn bus.

23:28.929 --> 23:32.193
If you got hit,
suck it up.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.325
But since I don't know
what she look like,

23:34.369 --> 23:35.805
thank you for the bus.

23:40.549 --> 23:41.681
- Take one step at a time.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.379
- Okay, I got it.
- You got it?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.336
- Yes.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.990
That's me.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.256
Ooh!

23:52.300 --> 23:54.389
Yes!

23:59.699 --> 24:02.658
♪ Shake it up
- Wow.

24:02.702 --> 24:05.966
- And it's my 40th, honey.
Definitely turnin' up tonight.

24:09.099 --> 24:11.667
My baby has made sure that
everybody in the room

24:11.711 --> 24:13.495
is people I love.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.628
Hey, boo.

24:16.672 --> 24:20.197
This is so nice.
Yes, come on.

24:20.241 --> 24:23.374
This is the energy
that I want to be around,

24:23.418 --> 24:26.203
right here.
It's all love.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.510
- Happy birthday!

24:32.558 --> 24:34.864
- Drew!

24:34.908 --> 24:38.738
Hi, baby.
- I miss you.

24:38.781 --> 24:39.739
- I ain't seen you
in forever.

24:39.782 --> 24:41.392
- Happy birth-- I know.
- Jesus!

24:41.436 --> 24:42.785
- It's been too long.
- Thank you.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.874
- I missed everything.
- By the way, I'm engaged.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.528
- Hi. Uh--

24:46.572 --> 24:47.877
That's what I said.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.531
I-I leave, and then you
have a whole new life.

24:49.575 --> 24:50.924
- I know.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.146
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- How are you?

24:56.190 --> 24:57.408
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.497
You like to hug.
- I'm from-- I like to hug.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.411
Yes, we like to hug.
- How are you?

25:00.455 --> 25:01.761
- Very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.328
- Y'all never-- oh.
- We never officially met.

25:04.372 --> 25:07.114
- Okay.
- I saw you in your home

25:07.157 --> 25:08.507
but...

25:08.550 --> 25:09.769
- This is a beautiful home,
by the way.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.031
- Thank you.
- Yes.

25:11.074 --> 25:13.163
- This is what dating
a 65-year-old does.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.079
Yes.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.741
- I'm gonna
this bitch up.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.700
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

25:27.743 --> 25:29.571
- Ooh.
- Get the off me!

25:32.182 --> 25:33.706
- I don't know everything.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.316
I don't need--
it's not my business.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.058
I'm just happy that she's happy,
and that's all that matters.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.930
- I promise you, one day,
it will all make sense.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.325
Nice to have you guys.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.501
Porsha and I match

25:46.545 --> 25:50.026
in terms of
how we have a good time.

25:50.070 --> 25:54.161
- Happy birthday, Porsha!
- Whoo!

25:54.204 --> 25:57.425
And so, if I choose that
I'm gonna turn the up,

25:57.468 --> 25:58.469
well, guess what.

25:58.513 --> 25:59.470
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

26:03.518 --> 26:05.085
- Shots!
- Come on!

26:05.128 --> 26:06.869
- Shots!
- Shots!

26:06.913 --> 26:09.611
Happy birthday.
We love you.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.308
- Thank you.
Thank you for loving us.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.663
Come here, baby.
I wanna walk outside

26:17.706 --> 26:19.534
and have a moment with you.
- Oh, okay.

26:21.754 --> 26:22.842
So, what do you think?

26:22.885 --> 26:26.672
- I love it.
You went all out, babe.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.064
But I wanted to just talk
to you real quick.

26:28.108 --> 26:31.807
- Mm-hmm.
- About your post.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.853
- I was just playing.

26:33.896 --> 26:37.291
I didn't mean to do that.

26:37.334 --> 26:40.642
- You didn't mean to do what?
- It was your birthday.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.689
My purest feelings
should-- should be--

26:48.389 --> 26:50.304
Whew.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.176
It should--
it should not be censored.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.351
- Okay.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.745
- That's-- that's,
like, a special day.

26:56.789 --> 26:58.094
- No, I think you know
I wouldn't wanted you

26:58.138 --> 27:00.183
to post some
of those pics.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.229
Our first kiss?

27:02.272 --> 27:03.752
Our tattoo?

27:03.796 --> 27:05.188
- You didn't like
any of those?

27:05.232 --> 27:07.060
- Baby, I love
those pictures.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.670
You know that.
- I love those pictures.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.672
- You love the meaning
behind all of those,

27:10.716 --> 27:11.804
all of that, right?
- Mm-hmm.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.719
Yeah, mm-hmm.
- But it's ours.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.852
- Some of that stuff
I put out

27:16.896 --> 27:18.114
is something
you've already put out.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.594
You've already
talked about.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.685
For example, you talked about
you tattooed my name,

27:23.729 --> 27:25.034
but you never showed
what it was.

27:25.078 --> 27:26.688
- And we don't--
and we don't need--

27:26.732 --> 27:28.037
I don't think
they deserve to see.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.560
- It's such beautiful artwork.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.389
- It's gorgeous artwork.
I love it.

27:32.433 --> 27:35.871
It's just when it comes to
what we share,

27:35.915 --> 27:39.222
I just-- we gotta go back
to what we talked about.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.572
Consult me. That's it.
- I got ya. I got ya.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.226
- You got me.
- I got you.

27:43.270 --> 27:46.708
What I think and feel
about social media,

27:46.752 --> 27:48.188
I don't give a [BLEEP],

27:48.231 --> 27:51.060
but Porsha's feelings
should have been respected,

27:51.104 --> 27:54.020
and I'm gonna back
the up.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.499
- That's it. I-I-- you know.
- You having fun?

27:55.543 --> 27:57.719
- When I go back in
and take off these shoes, I am.

27:57.763 --> 27:58.720
- Well, let's go take
your damn shoes off then.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.026
- When I go take
these shoes off,

28:00.069 --> 28:02.332
I'm gonna show you
what this dress do.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.595
- That's what I wanna see
right now.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.642
- Bow my ass down.
Bop-bop.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.209
I love you.
- I love you, too.

28:09.252 --> 28:10.601
- Okay.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.038
Comin' up next...

28:12.081 --> 28:14.344
- There are women from
my part of the country

28:14.388 --> 28:15.998
that tell their husbands,

28:16.042 --> 28:18.609
you can have
one side bitch.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.002
Then we're good.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.974
- This is
a cute restaurant.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.671
- Yeah,
never been here before.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.194
- Me either.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.373
Thank you, honey.
- All right.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.505
- Thank you.
- Comfy?

28:44.548 --> 28:47.813
- Yes.
- Alrighty.

28:47.856 --> 28:49.989
- Date day. I was gonna say,
"Date night."

28:50.032 --> 28:51.860
Might as well say, "Date day."
- It's about time.

28:51.904 --> 28:54.863
- I did happen to check
some of the comments,

28:54.907 --> 29:00.086
and they were loving
your little post,

29:00.129 --> 29:02.044
and I was like okay.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.090
The things you do
happen to work out.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.005
What are you gonna
drink tonight?

29:06.048 --> 29:07.049
You want
a little cocktail?

29:07.093 --> 29:09.530
- '42.
- Let me do pinot noir.

29:09.573 --> 29:10.574
- I got you.
Yeah.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.706
- And let me go ahead
and order.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.186
Tomato and peach salad?

29:13.229 --> 29:14.361
Okay, I think
I'm gonna try that.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.189
- Absolutely.
How about for you, sir?

29:16.232 --> 29:18.626
- Let me have the,
uh, the lamb meatballs.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.194
- Lamb meatballs? Good choice.
- All right, cool.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.630
- Okay.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.110
We match the environment.
You like how I styled you?

29:24.153 --> 29:26.286
Look, we--
- I love the way you did me.

29:26.329 --> 29:28.027
I love all the browns
that you brought out today.

29:31.421 --> 29:34.424
Cheers.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.646
- Mmm.

29:38.689 --> 29:39.865
- Hello.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.041
Lamb meatballs,

29:42.084 --> 29:43.738
and we have us here
a peach bruschetta.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.087
- Thank you.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.394
How are your balls?

29:50.179 --> 29:51.659
- They're comfortable
in my pants.

29:53.095 --> 29:58.057
- My fiance loves for Porsha
to just be Porsha,

29:58.100 --> 29:59.885
and that is a beautiful thing
because I have definitely

29:59.928 --> 30:02.365
had men to try to change me
back in the day.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.280
- I-- I'd like for you to
come home a little earlier.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.281
I'm not trying to
sound like your daddy,

30:05.325 --> 30:07.414
but this is just
what I want.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.242
You've gotta check that.
- Let me tell you what--

30:09.285 --> 30:11.505
what really--
- Did you hear what I just said?

30:11.548 --> 30:14.421
- To have someone who
simply loves you for you,

30:14.464 --> 30:15.814
is amazing.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.077
- Do you know how our big
our family just became?

30:18.120 --> 30:19.600
I'm-I'm the father of five.

30:19.643 --> 30:24.561
Yes, I come from a family
where there was abundant love,

30:24.605 --> 30:26.085
but it wasn't enough to go
around for many of 'em,

30:26.128 --> 30:27.434
- Because there's was
so many kids...

30:27.477 --> 30:28.565
- 'Cause there's
so many of them.

30:28.609 --> 30:29.610
- And so many wives.
How many wives?

30:29.653 --> 30:31.917
- Grandaddy-- 25.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.701
- Your daddy?
- My daddy-- two.

30:33.744 --> 30:36.269
- Two.
- Yeah.

30:36.312 --> 30:38.140
Where I come from,
there's nothing abnormal

30:38.184 --> 30:39.794
about having
different women.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.578
As a matter of fact,
there are women

30:41.622 --> 30:46.670
from my part of the country
that tell their husbands,

30:46.714 --> 30:49.108
you can have
one side bitch.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.326
And from time to time,

30:50.370 --> 30:52.285
the wife and the side bitch
get together

30:52.328 --> 30:54.156
and make sure there's not
another side bitch.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.552
I'm from Nigeria.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.120
The bottom line with coming
from a culture like that is,

31:01.163 --> 31:02.425
if you can take
care of your kids,

31:02.469 --> 31:03.949
nobody really gives
two

31:03.992 --> 31:05.080
- Well, I don't approve that.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.648
I can't speak for
all women of color,

31:07.691 --> 31:09.911
but I don't.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.478
You ever had cheated?

31:11.521 --> 31:14.916
- Of course,
everybody has cheated.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.963
- Multiple times?
- Multiple times.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.703
It did not happen
in my last relationship.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.705
- Okay.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.926
- My last relationship was
a turning point for me.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.580
I call it "you have
to break the cycle."

31:26.623 --> 31:27.668
- Mm-hmm.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.061
- My daddy came from
an environment

31:29.104 --> 31:32.151
where he didn't get
the attention from his dad.

31:32.194 --> 31:35.894
So, consequently,
having his own kids,

31:35.937 --> 31:38.287
me being number one--
- Mm-hmm.

31:38.331 --> 31:39.854
- I didn't get any
of that either.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.335
- That's what drives Dennis.
- Yeah.

31:42.378 --> 31:45.512
- Was that him and his father
weren't that close.

31:45.555 --> 31:48.515
He is wanting to break
that cycle for his daughter

31:48.558 --> 31:51.431
and have a close relationship.
- Yeah, right.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.694
- Which was
attractive to me.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.087
I do think, eventually,

31:55.130 --> 31:58.003
that you and him
should have a conversation.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.961
- I'll take let him
take me in doses.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.224
- What do you mean?

32:02.268 --> 32:04.966
- I-- I swooped right into
this house household.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.141
- You said, "Swoop."

32:06.185 --> 32:07.142
It was like you just
swooped his family

32:07.186 --> 32:08.187
up from underneath him.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.971
- I don't know
how done he felt.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.713
If Porsha and I
were not engaged,

32:12.756 --> 32:16.064
Dennis would not be the type
of man for me to hang out with.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.979
I wouldn't even know
what to talk to him about,

32:18.023 --> 32:22.418
but I understand the importance
of an inclusion of Dennis

32:22.462 --> 32:25.030
in their relationship
as co-parents.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.032
- Come on.
Cheers to our love.

32:27.075 --> 32:29.599
- Love you.
- And understanding

32:29.643 --> 32:33.603
and some grown-ass conversation
in this bitch.

32:33.647 --> 32:34.561
There you go.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.832
I'm hungry.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.312
Put these flowers
right here.

32:46.355 --> 32:49.402
Ahh!

32:49.445 --> 32:51.056
Ahh! Ahh!

32:51.099 --> 32:52.840
Jesus.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.975
Coming!

32:57.018 --> 32:58.498
Hey.
- Hi.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.369
- What you got?
Some flowers for me?

33:00.413 --> 33:03.242
Some baby's breath?
- Girl, for tomorrow, yes.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.244
- Oh. I like this dress
you're giving.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.288
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Everything.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.248
- Girl, how are you?
- I'm good.

33:09.291 --> 33:10.945
I was just lookin'
at all this stuff

33:10.989 --> 33:12.816
because first thing
this morning,

33:12.860 --> 33:14.775
they starting bringin'
stuff for the cookout.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.037
- O-M-G, everything.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.996
- So, I realized
the cookout is here.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.432
- You didn't know that?
- No.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.043
- That's a lotta alcohol.
We're gonna have some fun.

33:22.087 --> 33:25.655
- So, Londie
is my first cousin.

33:25.699 --> 33:27.831
She's an event planner.
She also does the decor

33:27.875 --> 33:29.964
for a lot of different
events that I have.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.966
- It's a little stuffy in here.
You wanna go outside?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.273
I wanna see
the furniture anyways.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.014
- She is the person
in the family

33:36.057 --> 33:38.103
who is the voice of reason

33:38.146 --> 33:39.800
in a lot of different
situations.

33:39.843 --> 33:40.844
If she don't
do nothin' else,

33:40.888 --> 33:41.976
she gonna give you
the truth, okay?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.848
She gonna tell it is.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.198
So, don't ask, all right?

33:46.241 --> 33:47.677
Oh, this is nice.
- Awe!

33:47.721 --> 33:48.722
- Look, it's got the lights
in here and everything.

33:48.765 --> 33:49.984
- And then the table
is under it.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.681
- Oh, yeah, this is nice.

33:51.725 --> 33:55.076
Who all is coming?
- Dennis and his date.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.991
- Ooh, his dates.
- That's who is coming.

33:57.035 --> 33:57.905
Dates?
- He said he--

33:57.948 --> 33:59.298
he runnin'
through Atlanta.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.473
- Oh, he gon' bring
two girls.

34:00.516 --> 34:02.257
- He-he is the eligible
bachelor, honey.

34:02.301 --> 34:05.086
- That's who he's bringing.
- No. Shut up.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.088
- No, it's supposed
to be more intimate,

34:07.132 --> 34:08.307
just family and everything.

34:08.350 --> 34:09.699
- Oh, okay.
- So, I'm not sure.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.701
- Oh, my God, I'm so glad
she got a damn tent.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.182
It's hot as hell right now.
- No, it's super-hot.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.010
- Sh--, I'm taking this off.
- I hope maybe there's
a fan or somethin'.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.664
It's very hot.
- Yeah.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.753
- Have you heard Dennis
been hittin' up Lauren?

34:19.796 --> 34:21.842
- About what?
- He's just been hittin' her up.

34:25.541 --> 34:27.239
- Do I get free hot dogs?
- Yeah.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.370
- All right.
I'll be there.

34:28.414 --> 34:29.850
That's fine.
Just text me what time.

34:29.893 --> 34:32.679
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:42.558 --> 34:43.951
- Bring it in.
- Hi.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.126
-

34:45.170 --> 34:46.345
Bring it in.

34:46.388 --> 34:48.608
What's up?
- Hey.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.218
- Have a seat.
- What have you been up to?

34:52.699 --> 34:53.917
Why are you looking
at me like that?

34:53.961 --> 34:55.136
- What you been up to?
What you been up to?

34:55.180 --> 34:57.225
- I am hungover and tired.

34:57.269 --> 34:58.879
- For real?
- Aww.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.576
- My relationship with Lauren,
I mean, that's my little sister.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.491
Look, at the end
of the day,

35:02.535 --> 35:04.450
regardless of what me
and Porsha got going on,

35:04.493 --> 35:05.973
we've always been cool.

35:06.016 --> 35:07.453
So, what's up?

35:07.496 --> 35:09.281
You know, Porsha been flyin'
all around the country.

35:09.324 --> 35:11.065
I ain't seen ya
since before then.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.153
- Oh, I thought we had
seen each other.

35:12.197 --> 35:15.069
- No. I seen you
on a few trips, too.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.766
- Yes, I went
for the engagement.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.421
So...
- Hmm.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.423
You think that's cool?

35:22.685 --> 35:24.078
- So, what's
the issue for you?

35:24.122 --> 35:25.427
Is it an issue that he was--
- He is nothin' that's--

35:25.471 --> 35:26.907
- That he-- that he was
in a pending divorce?

35:26.950 --> 35:28.691
- I mean--
- The papers had been signed

35:28.735 --> 35:31.085
a month or two before?
What-- what is the issue?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.086
- Let me clear
somethin' up.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.218
If Porsha happy,
then I'm happy.

35:33.261 --> 35:34.697
We got a kid together.

35:34.741 --> 35:39.093
It's in my best interest
to support this relationship.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.748
- Dennis has been
a real advocate

35:41.791 --> 35:43.402
for this relationship.
- Really?

35:43.445 --> 35:48.929
- Like, he's been solid
and supportive from day one.

35:48.972 --> 35:50.148
So...
- Okay, okay.

35:50.191 --> 35:52.280
So, you don't think
there's any hidden,

35:52.324 --> 35:54.239
you know, like, ego?

35:54.282 --> 35:55.240
You know how men are.
- I mean, the other day,

35:55.283 --> 35:57.546
that post online
was a little odd.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.592
- Dennis commented
on your little post.

36:00.767 --> 36:03.378
He said, "Okay, P. Willy,
I forgot you were engaged."

36:03.422 --> 36:04.858
- Yeah.
- But then Simon turned around

36:04.901 --> 36:07.252
and went on every single
one of my pictures

36:07.295 --> 36:10.646
and put a emoji heart
and hashtag mine.

36:10.690 --> 36:13.432
- Mine? No, he didn't.
Oh, my goodness.

36:13.475 --> 36:17.131
- It was a little odd
only because...

36:17.175 --> 36:18.741
he doesn't flirt with me.

36:18.785 --> 36:20.178
- You're the one that
wrote on her post,

36:20.221 --> 36:24.269
talking about some, "Ooh,
I forgot you was engaged."

36:24.312 --> 36:25.226
Dennis...
- That was a little joke, man.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.358
That was a joke.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.193
- I'm not. I'm not.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.891
- Little cakes were cakin'.
- I'm not high fiving this.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.632
Okay, that was messy.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.635
- Had he known about
the engagement before then?

36:42.678 --> 36:45.420
- So, here's the thing.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.074
When we were out of town,
that's when Simon proposed.

36:47.117 --> 36:48.641
- The engagement.
- Right.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.556
And the very next morning,

36:50.599 --> 36:52.645
is when I called Dennis
and told him.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.386
- But he knew about Simon
before that.

36:54.429 --> 36:56.344
- Oh, yeah.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.477
- Porsha called me
that morning.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.000
- The morning of what?
- She got engaged.

37:02.132 --> 37:03.699
But she just told me she was
starting to date somebody,

37:03.743 --> 37:05.614
like, two weeks
before that.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.094
So, they got engaged
in two weeks?

37:09.314 --> 37:11.011
How long they been dating?

37:11.054 --> 37:13.927
- At that point, literally,
like, two weeks.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.929
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

37:15.972 --> 37:17.539
- How long were y'all talking
before y'all were engaged?

37:17.583 --> 37:18.975
- Hmm...
right at a month.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.329
- It ain't the money,
is it?

37:24.372 --> 37:27.680
- I mean, she has
her own money.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.290
I mean, no.
- Huh.

37:29.334 --> 37:30.726
- What's wrong with her
just liking him?

37:30.770 --> 37:32.380
- I'm not saying she with
him for the money.

37:32.424 --> 37:33.686
I-I didn't say that.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.862
Could've been the cash.
Could've, you know--

37:35.905 --> 37:37.907
could be breaking her back out.
I don't know.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.909
Sh-- got me really
scratching my head.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.302
She wouldn't be talking
to me if I was broke.

37:41.346 --> 37:42.695
I guarantee that.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.044
I would've never had a kid
with her if I was broke.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.306
This sh-- ain't adding up.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.829
This sh-- is really
not adding up, man.

37:46.873 --> 37:49.441
Like, it look like
she took somebody's man.

37:49.484 --> 37:50.746
That what it look like to me.
- I know it does.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.531
I know it does.
- To-- to everybody.

37:52.574 --> 37:53.706
- I agree.
- I don't care how--

37:53.749 --> 37:55.229
what the real story is.
- Yeah.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.058
- Porsha gonna look like
the man stealer of the century.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.712
She may go in the hall of fame
for that sh--,

37:59.755 --> 38:00.974
to be honest wit' you.

38:09.156 --> 38:10.984
- Yeah.
- Porsha gonna look like

38:11.027 --> 38:12.420
the man stealer
of the century.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.987
She may go in the hall of fame
for that sh--,

38:14.030 --> 38:16.381
to be honest wit' you.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.469
You should've
stepped in and say,

38:17.512 --> 38:18.644
"Yo, man, this sh--
ain't cool, man.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.167
"Y'all can date."
- I did,

38:20.210 --> 38:21.690
but what do you want me to do?
- She'll listen to you.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.083
- I-- on Mother's Day,
if you would've called me like,

38:23.126 --> 38:24.345
"This is ----in' crazy.
Do something about it."

38:24.389 --> 38:27.696
I probably may have even
inserted myself a little more.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.307
- I wasn't hating.

38:29.350 --> 38:30.656
- I'm gonna be honest
wit' you.

38:30.699 --> 38:33.441
Mother's Day,
it was awkward.

38:33.485 --> 38:36.226
Simon pops up outta nowhere
on Mother's Day.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.491
The Mother's Day thing
was the most awkward situation

38:39.534 --> 38:41.667
that Porsha has ever
put me in, in life.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.583
It was just, like, Dennis,
he was so excited.

38:44.626 --> 38:45.888
I was already kinda, like,

38:45.932 --> 38:49.370
why is he doing
all of this? But...

38:49.414 --> 38:53.679
- If he woulda known
about the engagement

38:53.722 --> 38:55.463
before planning it--
- Right.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.422
- He probably
would've cancel it.

38:57.465 --> 38:59.772
- She told me
she was engaged.

38:59.815 --> 39:02.949
The next day,
we had a Mother's Day dinner.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.646
If I knew she was engaged
a month ago,

39:04.690 --> 39:05.865
I wouldn't have planned
that sh--. You feel me?

39:05.908 --> 39:07.997
- It had its awkward moments,
of course.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.391
Dennis is on this side
holdin' P.J., and it's like...

39:10.435 --> 39:11.697
- And y'all were sitting
on either side.

39:11.740 --> 39:12.872
- ...you know,
what we used to be.

39:12.915 --> 39:14.090
- Oh, my gosh.
- And then on this side,

39:14.134 --> 39:16.484
is my new fiance.

39:16.528 --> 39:18.007
All of us were drinking
to get through it.

39:18.051 --> 39:19.487
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.010
And so, we just went ahead
and just was like,

39:21.054 --> 39:22.969
you know what?
Let's take a picture.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.927
And somebody said,
"Are you gonna post that?"

39:24.971 --> 39:27.060
And I was like,
"Should I post it?"

39:27.103 --> 39:28.627
And I looked at Simon.
- They were beautiful pictures.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.673
- I looked at Dennis.
It was like do it.

39:31.717 --> 39:32.979
- Y'all all agreed to
post it.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.502
- We all agreed.
- Sittin' there at the table?

39:34.546 --> 39:35.895
- Sittin' there
at the table together.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.592
- You taking
that picture together

39:37.636 --> 39:39.638
made me feel like
you were supportive.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.379
- Definitely was
Porsha's idea.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.684
She said,
"Let's take a picture."

39:42.728 --> 39:43.859
I wasn't opposed
to taking a picture,

39:43.903 --> 39:45.774
because it is
what it is,

39:45.818 --> 39:47.602
but I didn't think,
at that moment,

39:47.646 --> 39:49.125
oh, this picture is gonna
break the internet,

39:49.169 --> 39:51.606
but it definitely broke
that mother----er, definitely.

39:51.650 --> 39:53.478
I mean, it's broke.

39:53.521 --> 39:54.914
Cracked open.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.699
- Has Dennis seen
the tattoo?

39:57.743 --> 39:59.397
Has he ever said anything?
- Simon posted the tattoo.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.877
- What did Dennis say?
- He text, and he was like,

40:01.921 --> 40:04.532
"Um, I don't think
that's a good look."

40:04.576 --> 40:05.533
- I can't really
believe it.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.708
I mean, I didn't
think it was real

40:06.752 --> 40:09.668
until I seen that tattoo.

40:09.711 --> 40:11.104
That's ridiculous, too.

40:11.147 --> 40:14.803
- I forgot about the tattoo.
- Goddamn.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.936
- I totally understand
why Dennis is upset

40:16.979 --> 40:18.111
about Porsha
getting the tattoo.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.113
He feels like that
was their thing,

40:20.156 --> 40:21.984
and now she's doing it
with someone else.

40:22.028 --> 40:25.423
- We locked it.
He got my name tattooed, so...

40:25.466 --> 40:28.469
And then I, in turn,
got a tattoo

40:28.513 --> 40:29.862
matching his, too.

40:29.905 --> 40:31.559
- I totally would've switched
up the body parts

40:31.603 --> 40:33.822
because, you know, it's almost
pitting them against each other

40:33.866 --> 40:35.128
on the back of her head.

40:35.171 --> 40:36.869
- Y'all are looking crazy.
I'm just sayin'.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.044
- Okay, well,
we looking crazy,

40:38.087 --> 40:39.741
but you coming to
the cookout on Sunday?

40:39.785 --> 40:41.134
- I ain't coming.
- You're not coming?

40:41.177 --> 40:42.309
- No.
- Why?

40:42.352 --> 40:43.832
- I can't bring no girl.
I ain't coming.

40:43.876 --> 40:44.746
- Why do you think she doesn't
want you to bring a date?

40:44.790 --> 40:47.009
- Because she still
love me.

40:49.751 --> 40:50.752
- That was a statement.

40:50.796 --> 40:51.971
Wait. Hold on.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.842
Did you just say
she still loves you?

40:53.886 --> 40:56.454
- She does, man.
I still love Porsha.

40:56.497 --> 40:57.672
I'll always love her.

40:57.716 --> 41:01.067
- I have no romantic
feelings for Dennis.

41:01.110 --> 41:02.503
I do not.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.550
I love Dennis because he
is a great father to Pilar.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.421
- Right.
- And my--

41:07.465 --> 41:09.771
my mind and my heart

41:09.815 --> 41:13.819
genuinely want my daughter
to have her family together.

41:13.862 --> 41:16.778
- I think Porsha and Dennis
are a little delusional

41:16.822 --> 41:18.345
when it comes
to each other at least,

41:18.388 --> 41:23.698
and I think that even though
she wants to fully let go,

41:23.742 --> 41:24.917
she can't.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.266
- But here's my thing,
Dennis.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.834
Are you okay?

41:28.877 --> 41:30.052
- Yeah, this ain't
about me,

41:30.096 --> 41:31.532
you gotta make sure
this is right, man,

41:31.576 --> 41:35.188
because Porsha flies fast,
and she crashes very hard.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.668
You know what I'm saying?
- She does and very hard.

41:36.711 --> 41:37.495
- You gotta make sure
this is cool.

41:37.538 --> 41:38.800
- I know. I know.

41:38.844 --> 41:39.845
- If this don't
work out for her,

41:39.888 --> 41:43.762
she gonna be
----in' devastated.

41:43.805 --> 41:44.937
She'll be devastated.
- I-I-- I know.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.242
- You hear me?
- I know.

41:46.286 --> 41:48.375
- Porsha and Simon,
they move way too fast.

41:48.418 --> 41:49.637
I've lived
this movie before.

41:49.681 --> 41:52.510
I've seen this,
and we'll see what happens.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.337
I'll be around for
the next 16 years,

41:54.381 --> 41:55.469
one way or another.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.602
Go home.
Shake Porsha.

41:57.645 --> 41:59.342
Look her in her eye.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.083
Tell her to blink twice
if she in trouble.

42:04.217 --> 42:06.524
- This season,
on "Porsha's Family Matters"...

42:09.048 --> 42:12.486
Uno, dos, tres!
Let's go!

42:12.530 --> 42:13.531
- Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye!

42:13.574 --> 42:14.793
- No!

42:14.836 --> 42:17.970
I have single-handedly
pulled my family

42:18.013 --> 42:20.799
and friends into
my personal sh--, okay?

42:20.842 --> 42:22.365
I'm his fourth wife.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.106
- Oh, my Lord.
- I thought it was the second.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.587
- I wanna know why Simon's
three previous marriages

42:26.631 --> 42:27.980
did not work.

42:28.023 --> 42:30.591
- I had to find out
about Simon on TV.

42:30.635 --> 42:31.810
- The optics
don't look great

42:31.853 --> 42:35.204
because people don't
have all the facts.

42:35.248 --> 42:36.902
- This trip can be
the best thing

42:36.945 --> 42:38.991
for our entire family,

42:39.034 --> 42:41.863
or it can be
a complete fiasco.

42:41.907 --> 42:44.692
- I would have broken
that bitch in half.

42:46.085 --> 42:48.653
- What are you gonna do?
- Girl, bye.

42:48.696 --> 42:49.784
- Now, all of a sudden,
he's at the table,

42:49.828 --> 42:51.307
and he's Mr. Tough Guy.

42:51.351 --> 42:53.483
- He needs to stay the
out of our business.

42:57.226 --> 42:59.446
- I'll take mentally stable
for $200, Alex.
