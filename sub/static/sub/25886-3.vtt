Huh? Nope!
We're waiting for Kamala.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.709
[chittering continues]
We talked about this,
and we agreed.

00:35.709 --> 00:39.750
We also talked about
the importance of willpower.

00:39.750 --> 00:43.667

Yes!

Wait. No.

Doreen, we need
to actually team up first.

right now!

01:13.875 --> 01:17.542
What better first mission
than bringing in
an ex-superhero?

01:17.542 --> 01:21.083
Okay. One: we don't know
that she went bad.
It could've always been a clone.

01:21.083 --> 01:24.041
Two: either way,
I am so, so in!
[screeching]

Why are you like this?

I'm so serious right now.
Oh, wow.
She's really persistent.

Think we have time
for just one cupcake?
Bad squirrel! Bad choices!

Hey, look over there!
It's a nut!
Yeah, probably.

[groans]
Come on.
Mmm?

02:03.792 --> 02:06.083
Take your pick-- Not that one!
But then we have to change.

Get back here, rodent!
You and your cheap accessories!

No! Okay, I didn't mean it!
I'm sorry!

I'm so sorry.

Just give up peacefully.
If you're really innocent,

it's time to stop running
and prove it.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

[sighs]
Probably, but not to you.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.542
Now, if you'll excuse me,
someone else
was chasing me first,

03:04.542 --> 03:06.917
and it is so rude
to cut in line.
