WEBVTT

00:21.066 --> 00:24.133
I'll be back! I'm free!

00:27.200 --> 00:29.366
No-o-o!

00:56.733 --> 01:00.666
'We're presently flying
at an altitude of 35,000 feet.'

01:00.733 --> 01:03.900
'Below us is the picturesque
city of Springwood.'

01:14.066 --> 01:16.533
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.566
Welcome to
the five mile-high club, Carl.

01:35.733 --> 01:37.900
What was that?

01:41.700 --> 01:43.366
Oh, my God!

02:07.300 --> 02:09.233
What's going on here?

02:20.300 --> 02:22.133
'Yes, beautiful Springwood.'

02:22.200 --> 02:26.266
'Home to the Springwood High
hockey champs, The Flyers.'

02:26.333 --> 02:28.633
'Jim, the starboard thrusters
aren't responding.'

02:28.700 --> 02:30.466
'Give it all she's got.'

02:30.533 --> 02:31.966
'Nothing, uh..'

02:32.033 --> 02:33.700
'Radio ahead.'

02:33.766 --> 02:36.966
'That was the engine.
It's gone.'

02:37.033 --> 02:40.733
'Uh, we're experiencing some
problems due to turbulence'

02:40.800 --> 02:42.733
'but we will be clear
in seconds.'

02:42.800 --> 02:44.966
Please remain calm.

02:45.033 --> 02:47.433
The cabin
has been depressurized.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.466
Take the mask from above you
and yank the rubber tube

02:51.533 --> 02:54.733
'to start the oxygen flow.'

03:00.133 --> 03:04.833
'First, attend to your mask.
Then to your child's.'

03:06.566 --> 03:08.166
It's not working!

03:08.233 --> 03:12.066
If all else fails,
refer to the emergency card

03:12.133 --> 03:14.433
in the pouch in front of you.

03:24.133 --> 03:26.200
I can't, I can't breathe.

03:26.266 --> 03:28.200
You're holding everyone up.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.266
I can't breathe.

03:34.666 --> 03:37.266
'You're holding everyone up.'

03:37.333 --> 03:39.800
'You're holding everyone up'

03:39.866 --> 03:42.233
- Carl?
- I beg your pardon!

03:42.300 --> 03:43.333
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.000
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.766
- The usual?
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.133
Make it a double.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.700
I can't wait to land.

04:44.766 --> 04:47.033
I got a room in the same
bed and breakfast place

04:47.100 --> 04:49.500
in Springwood. Do you remember
the last time we were there?

04:49.566 --> 04:50.633
I..

04:52.733 --> 04:54.600
Repeat after me.

04:54.666 --> 04:57.466
Flying is the safest
form of travel.

04:57.533 --> 04:59.900
- Flying--
- It doesn't help.

05:02.066 --> 05:04.300
Think about...
three nights of bliss

05:04.366 --> 05:06.533
in Springwood, not the flight.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.600
I feel better already.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.600
How's your dad?

05:14.933 --> 05:15.966
Uh..

05:28.566 --> 05:29.900
'I'm sorry.'

05:32.033 --> 05:33.666
Is there anything I can do

05:33.733 --> 05:35.200
Yeah.

05:36.366 --> 05:38.600
Help me run the company.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.033
No, thanks.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.566
Carl?

05:47.633 --> 05:48.866
Carl Ashe?

05:50.166 --> 05:52.733
Hey, junior, it's been a while.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.133
Do I know you?

05:55.200 --> 05:56.833
You don't remember me?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.400
I used to work
for your father.

05:58.466 --> 06:00.300
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

06:00.366 --> 06:02.400
- Thanks.
- Jim Worth.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.300
Hello again.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.266
Plant supervisor
for the factory in Chicago

06:10.566 --> 06:12.400
Well, I've never seen you there.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.566
I was fired
a couple of years ago.

06:14.633 --> 06:17.166
Your father made it a point
never to employ anyone

06:17.233 --> 06:19.200
that criticizes operations.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.533
Wait a minute. I do know you.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.733
But if I remember, dad fired you

06:25.800 --> 06:27.966
because you had a, uh..

06:28.033 --> 06:29.100
...a drinking problem.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.800
Had.

06:30.866 --> 06:32.933
Yeah.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.033
But if you knew then what
I knew about the company, you--

06:35.100 --> 06:37.966
What? Knew what?

06:38.033 --> 06:41.366
Let's just say that I'm glad
I'm flying this airline.

06:41.433 --> 06:43.366
But now with you in charge

06:43.433 --> 06:45.433
I'm sure you're gonna
turn the company around.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.000
How about a refill?

06:55.066 --> 06:56.966
Yeah. Yeah.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.033
And you?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.300
Soda.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.766
Thanks.

07:26.266 --> 07:29.133
Carl Ashe Jr. is gonna be sorry

07:29.200 --> 07:32.533
he ever flew the deadly skies.

07:32.600 --> 07:33.833
Uninvited.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.966
The drinks didn't work, huh?

07:40.033 --> 07:44.000
'...welcome you to Flight 976
Chicago to Springwood.'

07:44.066 --> 07:45.400
'Enjoy the flight.'

07:45.466 --> 07:47.100
You don't know yoga, do ya?

07:47.166 --> 07:49.200
Look, this is what you do,
you relax..

07:49.266 --> 07:50.233
...then you breathe deep.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.833
I-I missed that class.

07:57.900 --> 07:59.100
A tranquilizer.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.266
Maybe a tranquilizer
would help you.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.433
You're making the other
passengers very nervous.

08:04.133 --> 08:07.833
Look, someday you won't
have to worry about all this.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.833
You'll retire and you'll
spend the rest of your life

08:10.900 --> 08:14.333
in a mansion in Palm Springs.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.433
And if you're a good boy,
I'll come visit you

08:16.500 --> 08:18.700
once a month when I fly in.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.466
Sue? Sue, can I go
talk to the captain?

08:20.533 --> 08:21.533
I think there might be
a problem with the electrical--

08:21.600 --> 08:23.600
Shh, shh, shh.

08:23.666 --> 08:24.833
Carl.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.133
That's nonsense.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.500
Now, you know
how you are about flying.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.133
Okay.

08:34.566 --> 08:35.633
Sue, I-I..

08:35.700 --> 08:38.100
It's all in your mind.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.200
Okay, okay.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.866
Dammit!

10:49.833 --> 10:51.266
Stewardess?

11:19.700 --> 11:20.900
Ah.

11:33.700 --> 11:35.166
Get back!

11:35.233 --> 11:36.700
Get back!

11:36.766 --> 11:39.466
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

12:00.433 --> 12:03.933
Death to Ashe Air Parts!

12:20.366 --> 12:21.700
Is that everyone?

12:23.233 --> 12:24.233
'I think so.'

12:30.166 --> 12:32.266
And now we have
a bargaining chip.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.266
Shit.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.066
Hey, Ralph.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.566
We missed one.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.633
Get up, slug.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.900
Easy, easy, easy.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.066
I thought I killed
them all, Abbie.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.300
Hey, I love this suit.

13:30.366 --> 13:32.033
Fabulous pinstripe.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.300
Hold this.

13:44.533 --> 13:48.000
Well, looky here, Abbie.

13:48.066 --> 13:51.166
It's the chairman
of the board himself.

13:51.233 --> 13:54.833
Mr. Carl Ashe Jr., I might add.

13:56.533 --> 14:01.233
- What's going on?
- Quiet...Death Merchant!

14:01.300 --> 14:03.900
'You're making this
really easy.'

14:03.966 --> 14:05.333
Who are you people?

14:05.400 --> 14:09.300
We represent
the Consumer Terrorist Squad.

14:09.366 --> 14:10.866
We fight for the people's right

14:10.933 --> 14:13.133
to have a quality life.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.533
Yeah, and court's in session.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.366
Sit!

14:22.333 --> 14:24.133
Kill him..

14:24.200 --> 14:26.733
...like the others.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.866
'We sentence you to death..'

14:29.933 --> 14:32.433
...by firing squad.

14:33.733 --> 14:35.900
You're gonna destroy
the whole plane!

14:35.966 --> 14:38.933
No...this..

14:40.600 --> 14:41.800
...will destroy the plane.

14:43.533 --> 14:46.266
No! No! No!

14:54.200 --> 14:56.066
Goodbye, Mr. Ashe.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.066
Come on. Come on, dammit!

15:29.700 --> 15:32.066
'We have clearance to land.'

15:32.133 --> 15:34.333
'Please prepare for boarding.'

16:08.233 --> 16:10.200
Have you seen my ball?

16:13.300 --> 16:15.266
Oh, never mind.

16:34.466 --> 16:35.400
Sue?

16:36.566 --> 16:38.500
Take your seat, please.

16:48.666 --> 16:51.366
- Enjoy your flight.
- We intend to.

16:53.133 --> 16:56.333
This looks exactly
like the plane

16:56.400 --> 16:58.633
we took the last time.

17:07.033 --> 17:08.966
Sue, where are we?

17:13.066 --> 17:15.033
Prepare for departure.

17:50.433 --> 17:55.200
My God, Carly! Not you!

17:55.266 --> 17:57.200
I-it's a hijack, son!

17:58.066 --> 17:59.866
Help me, son!

17:59.933 --> 18:02.433
It's a hijack!

18:02.500 --> 18:06.466
A hija-a-ack!

18:19.866 --> 18:21.800
Hello?

18:23.066 --> 18:24.366
Hello?

18:24.433 --> 18:25.400
Oh!

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
You wanna fly
the plane with me?

18:28.766 --> 18:30.500
The pilot said
I could fly it.

18:30.566 --> 18:31.966
Shh. Be-be quiet.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.500
Go-go take your seat.

18:33.566 --> 18:35.766
I can do whatever I want!

18:43.366 --> 18:44.366
Hello?

18:53.133 --> 18:54.133
Oh.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.833
And now, our in-flight movie

18:59.900 --> 19:01.800
for your viewing enjoyment.

19:01.866 --> 19:04.600
We're proud to bring you
"Airport.."

19:04.666 --> 19:06.133
- Oh, boy!
- Oh!

19:06.200 --> 19:08.133
I've been waiting
to see that!

19:08.200 --> 19:10.500
Oh, how wonderful!

19:10.566 --> 19:13.600
'But first,
a word from our sponsors.'

19:16.566 --> 19:19.133
Ashe Air Parts have provided
us with some of the most

19:19.200 --> 19:21.866
spectacular crashes of all time.

19:22.966 --> 19:26.500
I had a whole 40 minutes

19:26.566 --> 19:28.966
to scream and pray

19:29.033 --> 19:31.666
before we hit the ground.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.933
It was exhilarating.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.466
I was going to grandma's.

19:36.533 --> 19:38.166
It was Christmas time.

19:38.233 --> 19:41.000
Santa was flying
outside the plane.

19:41.066 --> 19:43.866
Then Santa took the engines off
for his sled.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.566
I hear he finished
early that year

19:45.633 --> 19:47.666
'cause his sled went faster.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.533
I miss Christmas.
Don't you?

19:54.233 --> 19:55.433
'Ashe Air Parts'

19:55.500 --> 19:57.833
'the company
that couldn't care less.'

19:58.766 --> 20:00.866
It's lies, all lies!

20:00.933 --> 20:03.433
I know it's hard to swallow.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.033
Oh. Oh, my stomach.

20:09.133 --> 20:10.466
Here!

20:11.566 --> 20:13.500
Was it something you ate?

20:15.166 --> 20:17.466
Hey, do that again!

20:17.533 --> 20:19.633
'Attention, all passengers.'

20:19.700 --> 20:22.500
'We have reached
our final destination.'

20:22.566 --> 20:24.866
'The great beyond.'

20:24.933 --> 20:27.800
'Please exit the plane
in an orderly fashion.'

20:36.566 --> 20:39.800
On behalf of the crew
and members

20:39.866 --> 20:42.233
of Flight 976

20:42.300 --> 20:43.800
we just wanted to say..

21:03.266 --> 21:04.933
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:09.766 --> 21:11.400
Have a great day.

21:11.466 --> 21:14.066
Thanks for flying
Trans City Air.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.433
'Uh, uh, give me a wrench.
Twelve millimeter.'

21:33.500 --> 21:36.233
- 'Dad?'
- Where is that wrench?

21:36.300 --> 21:37.833
Dammit! Give me a hand!

21:37.900 --> 21:39.033
What, what are you doing?

21:39.100 --> 21:42.100
Getting rid of the evidence.
Oh, oh..

21:42.166 --> 21:44.033
Old parts, Carly.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.800
All those planes we've worked on

21:45.866 --> 21:48.833
we fitted with
third-rate equipment.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.133
How could you do that, dad?

21:50.200 --> 21:52.366
Oh, don't yell at me.

21:52.433 --> 21:54.066
In all the times
you were busy rebelling

21:54.133 --> 21:55.800
you should've
been helping me.

21:55.866 --> 21:59.333
Mmm. I did all for you,
so you can live better.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.233
Well, why didn't you tell me?

22:01.300 --> 22:04.500
Let's talk some more, huh.
Them nuts and bolts..

22:04.566 --> 22:06.500
Then it gets going,
you know, fins, masks

22:06.566 --> 22:08.033
thrusters, airplane gears.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.933
I mean, even&lt;col12

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Then it's the 12-set
screwdrivers going

22:12.066 --> 22:14.533
for $2000 to the government.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.933
The Pentagon
for crying out loud.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.200
I had no idea, dad.
I had no idea.

22:20.266 --> 22:22.633
Don't play innocent.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.033
Don't play innocent.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.133
You knew when you were working

22:25.200 --> 22:26.833
in the darkroom for me.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.700
You always knew.

22:28.766 --> 22:30.333
You'd laugh at me and say

22:30.400 --> 22:33.266
"Skipper, let the buyer beware!"

22:33.333 --> 22:34.666
Well, it's not too late, dad.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.733
Dad, I, I can, I-I can
turn things around.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.266
I can change all that!

22:38.333 --> 22:40.800
Daddy. Dad..

22:40.866 --> 22:43.200
Help me, dad.
Help me set the plane down!

22:43.266 --> 22:45.933
Don't you think I've tried

22:48.066 --> 22:52.700
We're stuck
in automatic pilo-o-ot!

22:52.766 --> 22:56.033
Toys! Toys, daddy.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.500
Daddy, no! No!

22:58.566 --> 23:00.433
No!

23:03.900 --> 23:07.233
No. Oh, daddy. Daddy, no.

23:14.233 --> 23:16.833
Daddy.

23:37.933 --> 23:39.266
- Thank you.
- Bye.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.900
Thank you.

23:53.133 --> 23:55.433
Hey, Carly, rise and shine.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.733
We're in Springwood.
You know what that means?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.233
Party!

24:02.833 --> 24:04.333
Carl?

24:04.400 --> 24:05.566
Carl.

24:11.466 --> 24:13.200
Oh, no.

24:13.266 --> 24:16.733
Carl...what have you done?

24:16.800 --> 24:18.733
What have you done?

24:20.066 --> 24:22.666
Oh.. Damn you.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.933
What did you do?
Wake up, please.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.666
Carl, just...wake up.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.700
You don't know
what you meant to me.

24:43.933 --> 24:46.433
Carl...pl..

24:52.333 --> 24:56.500
Our friend Carly could use
some spare parts right now.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.833
It maybe a brain or a heart.

25:01.366 --> 25:05.100
The only way to fly!

25:31.233 --> 25:33.166
'How about another, Rog?'

25:35.200 --> 25:37.566
Last call was five minutes ago.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.200
Party pooper.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.666
Someone die?

26:16.566 --> 26:17.833
Hi.

26:17.900 --> 26:18.933
Hello.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.600
How was the funeral?

26:23.733 --> 26:25.666
How come you weren't there

26:29.833 --> 26:31.766
Funerals aren't my thing.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.033
Yeah, but still
he was your

26:38.566 --> 26:40.266
I wouldn't go that far.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.800
Oh.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.733
We had some fun.

26:50.366 --> 26:52.066
Wanna dance?

26:52.133 --> 26:54.500
No, I'm not..

27:00.466 --> 27:03.100
You dance like a married man.

27:06.733 --> 27:09.100
Well, how can you tell?

27:09.166 --> 27:11.166
I was married.

27:11.233 --> 27:13.566
Oh, Betty was a great dancer.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.733
You remind me a lot of Betty.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.900
Why don't you come home with me?
You can sleep it off.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.933
How do I know you're not
some kind of weirdo?

27:25.566 --> 27:27.066
I promise, I won't touch you.

27:27.133 --> 27:30.566
That's the kind of weirdo
I'm talking about.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.833
Rog, hold all my messages.

27:39.900 --> 27:41.066
Yeah, sure.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.666
Our little Sue
seems to be looking for love

28:04.733 --> 28:06.600
in all the wrong places.

28:17.700 --> 28:20.166
But I can handle barflies.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.300
Where are we? Heh heh.

28:25.366 --> 28:26.933
I bought this place
for Betty.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.933
She was also a stewardess.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.466
When we were married she thought
she was going to love it here.

28:32.866 --> 28:34.500
But she couldn't stand being

28:34.566 --> 28:37.166
so isolated from everything.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.400
So do you take free spirits

28:40.466 --> 28:42.133
and lock them up?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.800
Oh, no. No.

28:44.633 --> 28:46.866
Out here we set you free.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.733
What happened to Betty?

28:53.666 --> 28:57.266
She died in an accident
a year ago.

28:59.066 --> 29:00.200
I'm sorry.

29:05.033 --> 29:06.633
So am I.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.466
Impressive.

29:16.266 --> 29:18.833
What'd you say
you did for a living?

29:18.900 --> 29:21.233
I write technical journals.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.433
I spend a lot of time here.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.733
Let me get your things.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.633
Wo-o-ow.

29:34.066 --> 29:36.500
Cozy.

29:36.566 --> 29:39.200
You sleep in there
and I'll bunk in here.

29:48.366 --> 29:49.766
Voila.

29:51.766 --> 29:53.533
You thief.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.433
Oh, I'm no thief.
I'm a collector.

29:57.633 --> 29:59.433
It's more than a hobby.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.600
It's a fetish.

30:01.666 --> 30:04.566
Like feet
or edible underwear.

30:04.633 --> 30:07.800
Youareweird.

30:07.866 --> 30:09.866
But harmless.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.866
Let me show you the kitchen.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.600
Voila.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.866
Here it is.

30:18.933 --> 30:20.866
Feel free to use it.

30:26.766 --> 30:28.966
How about some cocoa?

30:40.266 --> 30:42.666
Well, I've basically
told you my life story.

30:42.733 --> 30:44.866
Why don't you
tell me about yours?

30:48.866 --> 30:50.466
You know, Jim..

30:50.533 --> 30:52.466
...I wouldn't mind it
if you tried something.

30:56.100 --> 31:00.066
I think a woman should be
idolized and not treated as..

31:00.133 --> 31:02.333
Well, you know?

31:02.400 --> 31:03.833
You're shy.

31:03.900 --> 31:06.633
I like that in a guy.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.000
But you brought me here
for a reason, Jim.

31:09.066 --> 31:11.900
Don't play innocent.

31:11.966 --> 31:14.733
Well, why did you
come here with me?

31:14.800 --> 31:17.433
Why not?
We both want the same thing.

31:18.666 --> 31:21.100
What's that?

31:31.800 --> 31:33.933
Look, it's..

31:34.000 --> 31:35.033
Why don't you turn in?

31:35.100 --> 31:37.533
It's, it's 5:30 in the morning.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.600
Where are you goin'?

31:40.666 --> 31:43.133
I'm gonna try my luck
at some fishing.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.066
Now?

31:45.133 --> 31:47.066
It's the best time for it.

31:47.133 --> 31:48.766
Oh, and..

31:48.833 --> 31:50.700
...if you're thinkin'
of goin' out

31:50.766 --> 31:52.733
try not to stray too far.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.766
These woods are filled
with hunters. They..

31:55.833 --> 31:57.166
They'll shoot at anything
once they've had

31:57.233 --> 32:00.366
their prerequisite
six pack of beer.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.833
Thanks for the warning.

32:52.966 --> 32:54.233
Kinky.

33:17.800 --> 33:18.966
'Get up.'

33:21.766 --> 33:24.700
I said, "Get up!"

33:25.900 --> 33:27.600
No.

33:28.433 --> 33:29.933
I said..

33:30.000 --> 33:32.700
Get up, Sue.
Rise and shine.

33:32.766 --> 33:34.633
Breakfast is ready.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.333
Mmm, thank you very much,
Mr. Worth.

34:22.733 --> 34:24.433
Mmm.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.733
Good morning.

34:32.666 --> 34:35.033
This is the country, honey.
Drawl it out.

34:35.100 --> 34:38.066
Oh, alright.

34:38.133 --> 34:40.133
Good mornin', Ms. Kaller.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.300
I hope you like fish.

34:43.366 --> 34:45.466
I do.

34:45.533 --> 34:48.866
Well, good.
'Cause you're gonna clean 'em.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.166
No way, you caught 'em,
you kill 'em, okay?

34:51.233 --> 34:52.566
Well, they're already dead. See?

34:52.633 --> 34:54.866
Get those things away from me!

34:54.933 --> 34:57.500
- Mmm.
- Ha ha ha.

34:57.566 --> 34:59.966
Oh, you're just like Betty.

35:00.033 --> 35:02.000
Betty hated fishing.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.433
Are you feeling
better this mornin'?

35:11.633 --> 35:13.633
Much better.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.633
However, I think
I should be goin'.

35:17.900 --> 35:20.100
'Why don't you enjoy your coffee
out on the porch?'

35:22.300 --> 35:24.100
I've gotta clean these fish

35:24.166 --> 35:26.333
before they stink up the place.

35:28.833 --> 35:30.600
Have you had enough to eat?

35:30.666 --> 35:33.000
Oh, I'm stuffed.

35:36.133 --> 35:38.200
We'll work that off later.

36:12.533 --> 36:14.033
Mmm.

36:15.166 --> 36:17.100
What's that smell?

36:57.133 --> 36:58.866
My stuff.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.433
Damn!

37:38.966 --> 37:40.466
See something you like?

37:40.533 --> 37:42.166
Oh, I see you've met Betty.

37:55.100 --> 37:56.700
Oh, my..

37:56.766 --> 37:58.533
...God.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.066
Sue..

38:00.133 --> 38:02.766
...I don't, I don't
wanna hurt you.

38:02.833 --> 38:05.166
Only preserve you.

38:05.233 --> 38:07.933
Save you from your
destructive self.

38:09.266 --> 38:11.533
You're going to hell, man!

38:11.600 --> 38:13.766
I know your kind!
You think you can keep us.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.533
Well, you can't.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.700
You won't!

38:17.766 --> 38:18.800
'Stop it! Stop it! Stop--'

38:18.866 --> 38:21.966
I'm gonna let you
think about it a while.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.300
I'm gonna give you plenty
of time to make a decision.

38:24.366 --> 38:27.733
No! Let go of me!

38:27.800 --> 38:28.600
- You--
- No!

38:28.666 --> 38:30.333
'You take a look inside!'

38:30.400 --> 38:32.100
No, let me go!

38:34.066 --> 38:35.566
Let go of me!

38:39.666 --> 38:41.133
Let me out!

38:41.200 --> 38:43.100
You bastard!

38:44.200 --> 38:45.266
Oh, my God.

38:53.866 --> 38:55.500
Oh, my God.

38:55.566 --> 38:57.766
'No. No!'

38:57.833 --> 39:00.366
'No-o-o!'

39:38.800 --> 39:42.166
'Please help me. Somebody.'

39:43.733 --> 39:45.666
'Somebody help me.'

39:45.733 --> 39:47.200
'Please!'

39:47.266 --> 39:49.666
'Please! I know you're there!'

39:49.733 --> 39:51.666
'Let me out of here!'

39:51.733 --> 39:53.066
'I can hear you!'

39:53.133 --> 39:55.033
'I know you're out there!'

39:55.100 --> 39:57.333
'Help me! Please!'

39:57.400 --> 40:00.700
'Don't you leave me in here!'

40:05.100 --> 40:06.733
'You damn whore!'

40:06.800 --> 40:09.300
'Come back here! I'll get you!'

40:20.300 --> 40:21.700
Stop!

40:22.866 --> 40:25.133
Stop, please, stop!

40:25.866 --> 40:27.166
Stop!

40:37.500 --> 40:40.333
Please give me
a ride to town?

40:40.400 --> 40:43.400
Sure. Here,
cover yourself up.

40:43.466 --> 40:45.566
Oh, thank you,
you're very kind.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.600
Where are you coming from?

40:49.666 --> 40:51.966
I'm coming from back there,
this cabin..

40:52.033 --> 40:54.200
Oh, never mind,
it's-it's over with.

40:56.566 --> 40:58.500
Argument with your husband

41:01.933 --> 41:05.233
How could I be so stupid?

41:05.300 --> 41:07.833
I should have known
never to go home with strangers.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.133
You're no better
than a ten-dollar tramp

41:11.200 --> 41:13.133
if you ask me.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.666
You're trying to get out
of another commitment, huh?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.733
'Well, you can only&nbsp;
dumps

41:19.800 --> 41:22.333
'before they'll want revenge.'

41:22.400 --> 41:23.666
Best thing to do is put your

41:23.733 --> 41:26.400
wanton heart to rest. Wai..

41:44.800 --> 41:47.300
Um, somebody's
trying to hurt me.

41:47.366 --> 41:48.400
'A man.'

41:51.466 --> 41:53.266
He has a gun.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.633
'I have to get to town,
I'll pay you money.'

41:59.066 --> 42:00.366
Please?

42:07.133 --> 42:09.066
My boys don't talk much, miss.

42:09.866 --> 42:12.833
Grady, get the hose.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.333
'Don't she remind you
of that other woman?'

42:15.400 --> 42:18.166
What was her name?

42:18.233 --> 42:20.966
Boy...is that the good stock?

42:22.033 --> 42:23.733
'Her name was Betty.'

42:23.800 --> 42:25.333
'Tom.'

42:27.266 --> 42:30.233
How about a little
Southern hospitality, trollop?

42:43.733 --> 42:45.866
You got five minutes head start

42:45.933 --> 42:47.866
then we're comin' after you.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.866
I just wanna go home.

42:51.933 --> 42:54.766
Well, you don't look
decent enough to have a home.

43:00.666 --> 43:02.166
Come on, boys..

43:02.233 --> 43:04.600
...I hear there's snipe
runnin' loose in the wood.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.033
There she is.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.700
Ow!

43:28.666 --> 43:30.400
- Come on.
- 'Let's go.'

43:39.033 --> 43:41.766
Take it easy!
No, no biting!

43:41.833 --> 43:42.766
Now..

43:42.833 --> 43:45.033
...that's a nice girl.

43:45.100 --> 43:47.966
Now...no mistakes, Suzie

43:48.033 --> 43:50.133
or I'm gonna break your leg
and leave you here.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.333
Now, you don't want that,
do you?

43:52.400 --> 43:53.700
Good.

43:53.766 --> 43:55.433
No sounds.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.366
Now...you havetwoopt

43:58.433 --> 44:00.766
Them...or me.

44:01.733 --> 44:03.666
Which is it gonna be?

44:06.800 --> 44:08.133
Move it.

44:15.633 --> 44:18.133
'Howdy, Jezebel.
Welcome aboard.'

44:21.233 --> 44:23.333
Love is a trap, baby.

44:24.100 --> 44:24.966
No.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.266
No.

44:27.333 --> 44:28.966
Smile for the camera.

44:30.033 --> 44:32.400
'Big smile. Look at the birdie.'

44:34.666 --> 44:36.166
'Say cheese.'

44:38.000 --> 44:39.933
'Big, big smile now.'

44:40.000 --> 44:41.233
'That's right.'

44:42.366 --> 44:44.600
'You started this.'

44:48.066 --> 44:50.666
'This is not my idea of R&amp;R.'

44:50.733 --> 44:52.533
'I'm outta here.'

45:29.800 --> 45:31.266
Oh, no!

45:31.333 --> 45:34.433
- Something wrong?
- Oh! Oh, God!

45:39.066 --> 45:41.466
'Help! Help!'

45:41.533 --> 45:43.400
No!

45:43.466 --> 45:45.466
Oh, my God.

45:45.533 --> 45:47.466
Sue, where are you goin'?

45:48.833 --> 45:50.166
Help.

46:20.833 --> 46:24.533
Everything's an endangered
species these days.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.300
Especially...nice girls.
