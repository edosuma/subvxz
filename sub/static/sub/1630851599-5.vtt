WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.634
You know, I can't believe
after all these volkswagens
we do,

00:02.670 --> 00:04.470
why does he hire, like,
somebody that's into it?

00:07.008 --> 00:08.107
This one looks
a little different.

00:08.142 --> 00:12.244
This is an original barn door
deluxe 1953 type 2.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.579
A rare bird, baby.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.583
This car here,
bad repair after bad repair.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.085
It's always more work
than you think.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.954
The trickiest part
is not to get shocked.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.193
This thing is super cool,
1969 austin healey.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.896
Not only do I not
wanna mess up the paint,

00:30.931 --> 00:33.065
but I don't wanna mess up
the vinyl.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.967
I'm really nervous
about that part.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.136
I wasn't a huge fan
of this bus when it came,

00:37.171 --> 00:38.971
but this is probably
the best bus I've ever seen.

00:39.006 --> 00:40.305
This is a pretty
important piece.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.741
-Peace.
-And hair grease.

00:46.547 --> 00:50.049
[dave]
<i>when I look at a blank canvas,</i>
<i> I see endless possibilities.</i>

00:51.052 --> 00:52.618
<i> As the ideas come to mind,</i>

00:52.653 --> 00:55.187
<i> the lines start to fall</i>
<i> into place,</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:58.257
<i> and before you know it,</i>

00:59.860 --> 01:02.194
<i> A bitchin' ride</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.495
This is gorgeous!

01:03.531 --> 01:06.265
<i> -...Performance...</i>
-It's fantastic!

01:06.300 --> 01:10.169
<i> ...Stance, wheels, sound.</i>

01:10.204 --> 01:14.373
<i> There's one thing that makes</i>
<i> our cars stand out,</i>
<i> ours are</i> bitchin' rides!

01:14.408 --> 01:17.376
Well, it never gets old.

01:26.187 --> 01:30.889
[phone ringing]

01:32.860 --> 01:34.293
how are you, tracy?

01:34.328 --> 01:35.594
<i> I'm good.</i>

01:35.629 --> 01:37.563
I'm gonna jump on the phone
with my very good friend,
tracy,

01:37.598 --> 01:38.864
who has given me
the opportunity

01:38.899 --> 01:41.767
to build the ultimate restomod
1950 hebmuller.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.103
But I'm really not expecting
any big surprises.

01:44.138 --> 01:47.005
So, speaking of doing well,
the hebmuller...

01:48.109 --> 01:48.974
It's hot sauce!

01:50.744 --> 01:53.812
We've been wrapping up
on an ultra-rare hebmuller.

01:53.848 --> 01:56.415
Not every day that I get
excited about a volkswagen.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.583
Dude, if you ain't got one,
get one.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.152
It's gonna be
the baddest of the bad.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.887
-You're going to love it.
<i> -I'm excited.</i>

02:01.922 --> 02:04.590
<i> -Hey, got a question.</i>
-Shoot.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.427
<i> I feel like the hebmuller</i>
<i> should have a friend,</i>
<i> a companion.</i>

02:08.462 --> 02:10.129
<i> There's so many different</i>
<i> volkswagens out there.</i>

02:10.164 --> 02:12.498
<i> My other interest</i>
<i> in volkswagens is a bus.</i>

02:12.533 --> 02:13.932
Okay.

02:13.968 --> 02:18.871
<i> But I want something rare,</i>
<i> you know, eye catching,</i>
<i> to match...</i>

02:18.906 --> 02:22.608
<i> Go with the hebmuller,</i>
<i> just to make it a family.</i>

02:22.643 --> 02:24.276
<i> I know if anybody can do it,</i>
<i> you can.</i>

02:24.311 --> 02:26.445
So, you want it to match
everything the same?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.781
<i> I think they should match.</i>
<i> I think they should come</i>
<i> as a team, a pair.</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:33.051
<i> It's, you know,</i>
<i> instead of one of a kind,</i>
<i> you got two of a kind.</i>

02:33.087 --> 02:34.019
Two of the family.

02:34.054 --> 02:35.721
Some people would call this
a big challenge,

02:35.756 --> 02:39.558
I'd actually call it
a second dessert,
or a big opportunity.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.792
I'm already
getting chills here.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.494
I'm super excited
at this point.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.962
Let me make a couple
of phone calls

02:43.998 --> 02:47.933
and see if I've got some
ends on some super early
vintage stuff,

02:47.968 --> 02:49.535
and I'll see what the rarest
of rare is,

02:49.570 --> 02:51.036
kind of like what we've done
with the hebmuller.

02:51.071 --> 02:53.906
<i> -It's gotta go</i>
<i> with the hebmuller.</i>
-Yeah. Man.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.974
<i> You know, I don't make</i>
<i> things easy, right?</i>

02:56.010 --> 02:58.644
No, but you know what?
I love talking to you
on the phone.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.079
I was already excited building
the hebmuller for you,

03:01.115 --> 03:02.814
but to do a matching bus
on that...

03:02.850 --> 03:06.051
<i> That would make my entire...</i>
<i> It would be phenomenal.</i>

03:06.086 --> 03:07.419
-That's awesome!
<i> -Unbelievable!</i>

03:07.454 --> 03:10.055
I'll start looking around.
Let's find the rarest of rare.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.924
<i> -Rare like us, right?</i>
-That's right, baby.

03:11.959 --> 03:12.724
<i> One or two of a kind!</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:17.362
Hey, what...

03:17.398 --> 03:19.298
-[dave chuckles]
-what is this?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.699
A rare bird, baby.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.736
This is an original barn
door deluxe 1953 type 2.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.405
Really rare!

03:29.843 --> 03:31.109
I have to be honest with you,

03:31.145 --> 03:34.112
I've been pretty pumped
to see this bad boy arrive,

03:34.148 --> 03:37.749
and let me tell you,
it's nothing like the normal
bus you see.

03:37.785 --> 03:42.221
We found an ultra-rare 1953,
which is the very first year
of deluxe bus.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.789
This one looks
a little different.

03:43.824 --> 03:44.823
Explain.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.525
So, a couple of things
you're probably noting

03:46.560 --> 03:47.793
is looking
a little bit different.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.229
Obviously, the tail lights
are extremely different.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.364
It has small glass
round tail lights,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.366
instead of the big
oval rounded tail lights,

03:54.401 --> 03:55.701
that normally we'd see
on them.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.402
So, this is all new to me.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.504
I'm gonna have to get tricky.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.906
It's got the quarter glass,

04:00.941 --> 04:03.442
package tray is way up
at the top of the interior,

04:03.477 --> 04:06.511
that deck lid goes all the way
up to that reveal line,
which is pretty rare.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.547
Dave keeps saying
the word "rare".

04:08.582 --> 04:11.316
Rare around this bus
doesn't really make
a lot of sense to me,

04:11.352 --> 04:13.185
but it's making me hungry.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.654
I want steak for lunch
and that's how I like it,
rare.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.491
It's got the ribbed bumpers,
they're steel.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.728
These never really
had any kind of chrome
around the windows.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.197
I might rethink that,
but maybe not.

04:25.232 --> 04:29.134
I don't want to do something
that is too far custom.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.103
I want to keep it classy,
kind of, like the hebmuller.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.237
Because it's so rare?

04:32.273 --> 04:35.207
Is this quarter panel...
Is that installed correctly?

04:35.242 --> 04:36.608
That's installed correctly.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.111
Really?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.746
With all of the spot welds?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.681
Spot welding, they would
body-work that out.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.882
You wouldn't actually
see that,

04:43.917 --> 04:45.851
but that's how it is, dimples.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.919
That's how these were.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.755
We're probably
gonna perfect it
just a little bit nicer.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.256
I don't want to see
that come back.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.359
The more I look at this bus,
and get used to the idea
of how early it is,

04:54.395 --> 04:57.562
the more potential I see
in the beauty of the build.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.197
There's something different
about the front.

04:59.233 --> 05:00.432
Are the noses different?

05:00.467 --> 05:02.367
I mean, I see something
doesn't look the same,

05:02.403 --> 05:05.304
and I've seen plenty of these,
because I've hung out
with you for so many years.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.740
As soon as I point it out,
you're gonna go,
"oh, no kidding!"

05:08.776 --> 05:10.842
there's no vent
above the window.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.479
This is all at the same angle.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.215
You see, I've never noticed,
like, this more
of a peak here too,

05:17.251 --> 05:18.917
now that you say that.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.688
Right, when you go to the ones
that did have the vent,
this doesn't have that peak.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.123
-It just goes round
all the way around.
-Wow!

05:25.159 --> 05:26.191
So, super cool!

05:26.226 --> 05:28.160
And, of course, no turn
signals up front.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.062
It'll have the semaphore.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.797
First I was excited
about steak.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.767
Now, I'm excited about steak
and getting this build
underway.

05:35.803 --> 05:39.104
Looks like we've got
a lot of great parts,
it's in good shape.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.138
I'm pumped.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.274
It's going to be really cool
to see a hebmuller

05:42.309 --> 05:44.710
and a first year deluxe bus
together, matching.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.178
I'm excited.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.646
I think we'll have to pull
everything out
from underneath this thing.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.648
Let's get it
chemically stripped
and start from bare metal.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.817
I agree.
I think that's going to be
our best point of attack,

05:51.852 --> 05:53.485
because who knows
how old this stuff is.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.453
Sounds good to me.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.254
I'm excited for this one.
This will be cool.

05:56.290 --> 05:57.723
I mean it's a volkswagen.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.400
Right now,
I'm taking all the parts off,

06:08.435 --> 06:11.837
so we can itemize it
and send it off to have a dip.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.081
I gotta inventory everything.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.183
This will help me figure out
what is missing,

06:25.219 --> 06:27.452
and what I need to get
or replace.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.770
Tear down on the top
of this bus
was pretty straight forward.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.005
I hope the bottom
is just as smooth.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.307
We're getting this thing ready
to go out to get stripped,

06:49.343 --> 06:52.177
because we don't like
this color.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.313
There's a lot of body work
that we need to unveil.

06:55.916 --> 06:56.882
Yeah, I'm done.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.159
Everything's disconnected.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.028
One bolt to go.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.432
[whirring]

07:15.936 --> 07:17.035
this is gonna be
the tricky part.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.004
The bolts are out, the beam
is ready to come down.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.807
You'd think dave,
the volkswagen lover,

07:21.842 --> 07:24.843
or whisperer, or whatever,
would be here to help.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.078
You know, I can't believe
after all these volkswagens
we do,

07:27.114 --> 07:28.914
why doesn't he hire,
like, somebody that's into it?

07:42.396 --> 07:45.063
I couldn't be more excited
for what I'm doing today.

07:47.701 --> 07:53.438
I am matching the hebmuller,
which is by far one
of the coolest cars,

07:53.474 --> 07:55.740
well, one of the cooler cars
that we've ever got to build.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.745
I get to match it
to a very early vintage

08:00.781 --> 08:06.852
1953 volkswagen
23 window barn door deluxe.
Rare.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.757
I am putting together
the same paint scheme,
same wheels.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.659
I'm going to do the same motor
and transmission

08:14.695 --> 08:16.528
and also the same
interior color,

08:16.563 --> 08:18.096
and of course I think
I'm going to take the liberty

08:18.131 --> 08:20.165
of putting some pop-outs
in the front.

08:22.970 --> 08:29.741
176 horsepower,
full leather interior,
big stereo system.

08:29.776 --> 08:34.346
It's done classic and clean
to where this steel
is gonna look vintage,

08:34.381 --> 08:35.647
it's gonna look very special,

08:35.682 --> 08:38.283
and it's just gonna be
super cool to see
these two together.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.754
I don't know
if there's another ultimate.

08:42.789 --> 08:46.591
We might find out one day
that there's something cooler,

08:46.627 --> 08:49.427
that we haven't done yet,
but as it sits right now...

08:51.398 --> 08:53.131
We've already done
the coolest of cool,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.100
and this is just gonna add
to the pool.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.369
Oh, that all rhymed.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.470
That's a lot of cool!

09:00.541 --> 09:02.173
So, let's lift it up
a tiny bit.

09:05.279 --> 09:06.411
Good or more?

09:07.714 --> 09:09.214
Talk to me, goose.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.349
I'm up... I'm off here,
so I don't want to have a ton
of pressure on it.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.786
We're risking our lives
to make sure this front end
comes out safely.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.454
You'd think dave
would be here to help.

09:16.490 --> 09:17.389
A little bit more.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.257
Are we gonna hit...

09:19.293 --> 09:21.259
Oh, we're hitting
the lift arms, bro...

09:22.596 --> 09:23.795
With these braces.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.669
These buses are really tricky
to put on lifts.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.638
They're really short
and they don't have
a lot of places to pick up.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.041
If the lift arms on this bus
don't play nicely,

09:36.076 --> 09:37.742
safety becomes a huge issue.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.847
-Go up a little more.
-Yeah.

09:47.020 --> 09:47.852
Good or more?

09:47.888 --> 09:48.987
A little bit more.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.491
Yeah, we're gonna have a...

09:53.527 --> 09:54.793
Hold on, we're gonna
have a problem, dude.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.968
Let's lift it up a tiny bit.

10:05.339 --> 10:07.672
Hold on.
We're gonna have
a problem, dude.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.009
We're hitting the lift arms,
bro, with these braces.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.811
Before we can get this bus
to chemical strip,

10:12.846 --> 10:14.312
we gotta finish the teardown.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.581
And so, far it's been easier
said than done.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.783
You should be able
to pull them down under.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.286
Go a little forward.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.454
Okay, now take it up.

10:26.593 --> 10:27.492
You go on or...

10:30.030 --> 10:31.363
There we go.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.397
There, man!

10:32.432 --> 10:33.665
That was super easy.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.833
I told you
we didn't need dave.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.571
Success!

10:49.216 --> 10:51.816
The vw bus has tore down.
It's sent off to dip.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.119
Let's just hope it comes back
in decent shape.

11:02.796 --> 11:07.365
[engine revving]

11:08.902 --> 11:11.803
in the meantime,
there's no shortage of big
or little projects

11:11.838 --> 11:14.072
willing to come into the shop.

11:14.107 --> 11:18.109
See what I did there,
big, little, bus, this one.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.181
Right on.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.357
My name
is glenn schimmelpfennig,
which is a tongue twister.

11:35.195 --> 11:39.864
The project I brought down
was my 1969 austin healy.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.766
This thing is super cool.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.569
Super cool, super small,
and super rare.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.038
The question is,
is it super-fast?

11:47.074 --> 11:50.241
I see that monster
supercharger on here.

11:50.277 --> 11:55.647
[glen] put a four bolt main in
it, with an oversized crank
to handle the supercharger.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.749
Well, that answers that.
Check.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.018
Delivers right around
150 horse.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.155
It went from red line
with 65 to 9000.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.457
Fun car.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.959
And as long as I'm going down
the freeway it's fine,

12:07.994 --> 12:11.162
but when I get into town
or stop to the stop light,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.731
I have to turn the engine off.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.934
But it's just not evacuating
any of the air.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.336
You want to do
these side vents
because, you know,

12:18.371 --> 12:20.672
this thing's producing
quite a bit more heat
with all that power,

12:20.707 --> 12:22.907
trying to evacuate some
of the heat out of this thing.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.977
With this small car,
having this supercharger
on here,

12:26.012 --> 12:29.180
we need to be having
a lot of air moving through
here to keep it cool.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.749
I think it's a great idea.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.752
Hopefully this brings
the underhood temp down,
gives the air somewhere to go.

12:33.787 --> 12:34.819
I think it's a good plan.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.088
Plus, if we design
and execute perfectly,

12:37.124 --> 12:38.757
this will really add
to the look of this car.

12:38.792 --> 12:39.858
I think it's gonna look good.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.292
I think it's gonna
look awesome on it.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.460
Hopefully,
with these new vents,

12:42.496 --> 12:44.596
it'll keep the essence
of the car,

12:44.631 --> 12:47.732
and blow that air out
of the engine compartment.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.901
-Is this thing vinyl-wrapped?
-Yes, it is.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.604
I put a clear vinyl wrap
on it.

12:52.639 --> 12:55.740
Very thin, so it's still
the true color of a car.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.611
It did create
a little more depth,
but a lot more protection.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.312
I think that's going to make
things a little difficult,

13:01.348 --> 13:03.281
but I don't think
it's a deal breaker.
I think...

13:03.316 --> 13:06.284
Yeah, it's gonna be really...
I'm really nervous
about that part.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.087
Making sure that the paint
and the wrap stays perfect,

13:09.122 --> 13:10.255
that'll be the tough
challenge here.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.390
But, if we get it right,
it'll be worth it.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.092
-Okay, cool.
I'll keep you in the loop.
-Thanks.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.138
First things first,
we're gonna go ahead
and scan the car.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.374
That way we can have
that information
in the computer,

13:29.409 --> 13:31.142
and we can start designing
these vents.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.578
Kind of play with it.
Don't make it too busy,
don't web the whole thing.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.679
Half inch squares.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.648
We'll see what it looks like,
with maybe a split.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.284
Collaboration is key
around here
at kindig-it design.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.852
I'm gonna go ahead
and give him
a couple outlines,

13:40.887 --> 13:42.420
and just let greg run with it.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.557
Trying to keep it rounded.
We want to make it look like
it's from the '60s.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.758
I don't want it
to look billet.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.293
You know,
with the spoked wheels
and everything else,

13:48.328 --> 13:52.363
I'm really, kind of, thinking
it has a lot of italian
and early England.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.532
Maybe if we just do something
kind of going front to back.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.369
Designing it like this,
it should be pulling some air
out of the engine bay,

13:58.405 --> 14:01.272
and hopefully dropping
the under hood temp
a little bit.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.407
Car looks super cool.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.942
I think it'll really be
a nice addition to it.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.486
Greg's done an awesome
job designing these.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.255
Now, we'll have
the client come down
and take a look at them.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.591
So, this is what
I came up with.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.625
It's machined aluminum.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.860
I think it's gonna look
really good.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.061
I think it matches everything.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.234
I think they look fantastic.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.435
Perfect.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.937
I tried to go off
of some of the existing pieces

14:32.973 --> 14:34.839
and kind of make the lines
the same shape.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.742
I didn't wanna make
something look like it was
gonna be on a lamborghini.

14:37.777 --> 14:39.777
-Yeah.
-I think this is pretty
sharp-looking.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.613
That's gonna be so nice
to have that done.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.148
I'll let you know
when this thing's finished up,
and you can come swoop it up.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.485
-Looking forward for that day.
-Right on.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.130
I'm going to go off
of my measurements here,

14:59.165 --> 15:01.132
get it laid out on there,

15:02.369 --> 15:04.903
and then I'm going to mask
the car up.

15:04.938 --> 15:09.507
I'm going to try to use
as few top work tools.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.043
I want to keep the sparks
to a minimum,

15:12.078 --> 15:14.112
and I also wanna keep the heat
out of this panel,

15:14.147 --> 15:17.048
because not only
do I not wanna mess up
the paint,

15:17.083 --> 15:19.651
but I don't wanna
mess up the vinyl.

15:24.190 --> 15:27.492
The big trick with working
on a car that's already
painted and wrapped,

15:27.527 --> 15:29.427
is to make sure you cut once.

15:29.462 --> 15:33.731
Which means you measure twice,
because there is no
second chance on this one.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.434
I think the car
has a little bit of a rake
to it, doesn't it?

15:39.139 --> 15:40.571
If the car
is sitting at a rake,

15:40.607 --> 15:42.607
meaning it's sitting
lower in the front
than it is the back,

15:42.642 --> 15:45.410
it's important to make sure
that we find out
what the level is

15:45.445 --> 15:46.511
of the rocker panel,

15:46.546 --> 15:49.147
and make sure that the vent
goes in that same angle.

15:49.182 --> 15:52.350
This will be very important
to make sure
that it doesn't look off.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.687
I think I got to find
a different method.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.898
The car has a little bit
of a rake to it,

16:06.933 --> 16:12.136
so I want to make sure
that this is gonna line up
with the stance of the car.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.072
Before greg can cut the holes
for these vents,

16:14.107 --> 16:16.908
he has to get them positioned
and make sure
that they're perfect.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.776
Once I cut this hole,
it's kind of permanent.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.716
So, there's the vent
and then there's my cut piece.

16:24.751 --> 16:28.386
Originally, greg was gonna
use the laser to get a nice
straight line on this car.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.487
But, to be honest with you,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.456
with the rake
that's on the suspension
right now,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.925
I think it might be
a lot better just to use
the template.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.428
I just made something
I could print out,
that's the right size.

16:37.464 --> 16:41.733
So I'm going to cut this out,
and then I can just tape this
on here and mark it out,

16:41.768 --> 16:43.668
and then I only have
to cut it once.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.837
Trying to work smarter,
not harder.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.438
Let's see if it works.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.445
Everything's looking good,
so I think
it's gonna work out.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.293
Right on. Let's go for it.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.669
The key to making sure
that he gets this vent exactly
where it needs to be,

17:18.705 --> 17:22.974
is to take your time, measure,
and use the right equipment,
and do not rush.

17:23.009 --> 17:26.544
This will ensure
that we don't melt the vinyl
or mess up the metal.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.747
I've got most of the cuts
all the way through.

17:29.783 --> 17:32.183
So, I think I'm gonna switch
to the air saw.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.468
The hole's cut
and the metal has been filed.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.805
Now, all he's gotta do
is install these
and he's finished.

17:57.510 --> 17:58.776
There we go.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.949
The fit up to the body
is really close.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.084
Looks really good.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.718
Cool.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.188
One test done,
one more big one to go.

18:12.325 --> 18:14.659
We'll see if I didn't
mess up that vinyl.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.394
I guess this part's
kind of important.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.365
I just want to go slow,
because if it does start
coming up,

18:21.401 --> 18:23.167
I don't wanna
just peel it all off.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.140
Looks like I didn't damage
any of the paint
or anything like that.

18:29.175 --> 18:30.508
I think it's gonna work
really well.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.014
Now that I got
the holes cut in the car,

18:37.050 --> 18:39.684
I'm just getting these pieces
drilled and tapped now.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.453
Then I'm just making sure
I don't drill through.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.791
So, I picked a spot
that has a pretty deep amount
of distance,

18:46.826 --> 18:49.227
but I'm only drilling
less than a quarter inch.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.333
And then I'll use a spiral
fluted bottoming tap

18:55.368 --> 18:58.536
to make the threads go
as far as I can
into those holes.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.012
Some custom hardware
and hand finishing

19:08.047 --> 19:10.882
makes it so you can't get
fingerprint smudges on it.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.518
It's kind of like
a nice, even smudge.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.787
And this custom vent
should be then ready
for its new home.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.027
Because this car
is made out of steel,

19:23.062 --> 19:25.930
I wanted to make sure
that this isn't gonna rust.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.599
So this is just some epoxy.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.402
This will just keep it
from rusting.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.410
This is anti-seize.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.313
These are stainless screws
going into aluminum.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.882
This is it.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.250
Some sharp stuff in there.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.557
The reason
this is kind of tricky

19:52.592 --> 19:55.626
is just because
these screws are really tiny,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.495
the area is so small,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.864
all the tolerances
for the holes
are really tight.

19:59.899 --> 20:04.602
So, I've got a few things
stacked against me,
but it seems to be going okay.

20:04.637 --> 20:09.273
A couple screws over here
that are poking my arm.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.510
Cool. There it is.

20:15.949 --> 20:16.881
Right on.

20:21.621 --> 20:24.855
Yeah, you can see
the air path from here.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.925
I think it's gonna direct air
out of there pretty well...

20:31.764 --> 20:35.099
And it looks really good, too,
which definitely counts.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.634
Greg crushed this project.

20:36.669 --> 20:40.037
He did a great job,
and it's definitely gonna
add to the look of this car.

20:44.510 --> 20:48.079
[greg] it feels pretty good
to just be able to make
the piece the way I wanted to,

20:48.114 --> 20:49.780
and the customer's
excited about it.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.849
I'm really happy
with the end result.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.151
I think glenn's gonna
really like it, too.

21:18.811 --> 21:21.045
Now that this bus
has been chemically dipped,

21:21.080 --> 21:23.447
it's now time to find out
what we're really
working with.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.548
What do you think, jason?

21:24.584 --> 21:26.083
This one's actually
pretty good.

21:26.119 --> 21:29.120
This is probably the best
bus I've ever seen,
come into this shop, anyway.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.488
Yeah.

21:30.523 --> 21:33.758
Well, probably didn't
even need to come here,
it was so nice.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.462
This is a pretty
important piece.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.632
Let's take a look around it.
I think we're in pretty
good shape to get going on it.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.867
Did this thing have safaris?

21:42.902 --> 21:45.269
Safaris are very hard
to come by,

21:45.305 --> 21:47.171
apparently
for a barn door deluxe.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.206
The window's
a different length,

21:49.242 --> 21:51.175
because it doesn't
have that overhang.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.576
And then,
what about all these?

21:52.612 --> 21:54.378
We need to do pop-outs
as far back as I can,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.080
but the other part of this,
too,

21:56.115 --> 21:57.348
is that if you look
at the rendering,

21:57.383 --> 21:59.417
I didn't do chrome around
all of the windows.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.918
-They didn't have chrome.
-But it needs that...

22:00.953 --> 22:02.019
It kind of does need it--

22:02.055 --> 22:03.721
...For the safaris,
'cause that's the frame right?

22:03.756 --> 22:05.122
Right.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.792
In the early frames,
it would have had frames
on a lot of the glass,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.860
and especially the pop-outs,
but they were usually
just painted black.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.529
They didn't have
a lot of chrome on a '53.

22:11.564 --> 22:12.930
-That makes sense.
-So...

22:12.965 --> 22:15.800
This is so much more
than just a very rare
vintage bus.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.669
It's now time to unlock
its customizing potential.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.304
Are we doing our trim on this?

22:20.340 --> 22:21.906
-We're gonna do
our trim on that.
-Okay.

22:21.941 --> 22:26.243
The back corners here,
it looks like just pretty cut
and dry, jason, honestly.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.512
Let's just go right up here
to the trim area.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.916
The engine, I don't think
you have to do any mods
to the perimeter.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.217
Automatic transmission
on this one?

22:33.252 --> 22:35.453
Same automatic transmission
as we did in the hebmuller.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.987
Okay.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.957
Same wheel and tire fitment.
Same engine.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.493
We can't do,
like a subaru engine?

22:43.696 --> 22:46.964
Why would you put
a subaru engine
in a volkswagen?

22:46.999 --> 22:49.066
Because it would be fast.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.634
-It'll be fast
with a volkswagen engine.
-Okay.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.036
Yeah. Yeah.

22:52.071 --> 22:55.406
Please send all of your emails
and hate mail to dave--

22:55.441 --> 22:56.607
kevdog.

23:08.454 --> 23:11.655
We're gonna go in
and get rid of all this
nasty repair work,

23:11.691 --> 23:13.491
and try to finish this out.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.960
Just so it has that real
clean stock look.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.097
There's multiple decades
of repairs that have been done
on this bus,

23:20.133 --> 23:21.399
and now,
it's time to take a look

23:21.434 --> 23:23.701
at what we really
got to work with,
and make it perfect.

23:23.736 --> 23:27.405
The difficult part is getting
the separation on these beads,

23:27.440 --> 23:30.040
and making sure that,
like here, how they end,

23:30.076 --> 23:32.376
you wanna have that gapping
the same.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.914
[dave]
there's a thousand ways
to skin a cat,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.883
and in this case,
ira's using a piece of wood,

23:38.918 --> 23:41.385
so you can hammer down
the sheet metal
into this groove

23:41.421 --> 23:42.686
to recreate the ribs.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.764
From gapping to welding
to metal finishing,
everything has to be perfect.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.801
Even if some of this
you won't see,
it's gotta be flawless.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.602
Even on the stuff
that you don't see,

23:58.638 --> 24:01.272
we want to make sure
that if somebody did
get to it,

24:01.307 --> 24:02.273
it's gonna look right.

24:09.782 --> 24:14.051
I'm trying to absorb
that little extra material.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.054
I'm just trying to find
where it's at.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.389
Like, where can I pull it?

24:25.064 --> 24:27.965
While ira puts
the finishing touches
on the front end panels...

24:29.802 --> 24:31.769
Jorge is gonna tackle
the rear quarters.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.544
I'm gonna replace this.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.813
It's not right
for the year of the bus.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.850
It's cut different.

24:45.885 --> 24:50.454
You can come over here it's...
You know,
years of bad repairs.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.990
Just better redo it,
make it look nice.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.526
This curve here, it's just...

24:57.230 --> 24:59.396
Bad repair after bad repair.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.876
There seems to be
a theme developing here.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.579
It's always more work
than you think.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.282
Everything looks easy
and simple,

25:18.317 --> 25:19.950
and then when you start
cutting into it,

25:19.986 --> 25:22.119
or popping out some filler,
and then you realize,

25:22.154 --> 25:23.721
"oh, there's a big hole
back there."

25:23.756 --> 25:27.391
this side has had
some pretty serious amount
of damage to it,

25:27.426 --> 25:29.260
and it's been repaired before
in the past.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.764
I'll have to duplicate
this corner,

25:33.799 --> 25:39.803
and then allow it
to extend below
into the lower dogleg section,

25:39.839 --> 25:42.273
and have a seam
that runs all the way down
to the bottom.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.590
It's getting there.
It's pretty close.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.493
[dave]
the new rear corner panels
have arrived,

26:02.528 --> 26:04.528
and now it's time for jorge
to make them fit...

26:10.736 --> 26:12.536
Which is easier said
than done.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.640
Sometimes these don't fit...

26:16.676 --> 26:20.077
So we get something
that looks like
a quarter panel.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.681
So now,
I get to splice it in half...

26:24.650 --> 26:27.251
And shorten it,
because it's too big.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.286
The trickiest part
is not to get shocked

26:29.322 --> 26:32.923
while I'm trying to hold
this panel together right now.

26:53.479 --> 26:54.411
Looks really good.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.016
[dave]
now, that the rear corners
are looking great.

26:59.051 --> 27:00.517
Now, it's time for us
to get our hands

27:00.553 --> 27:03.487
on one of my very
favorite parts of a bus.

27:08.527 --> 27:10.961
We're doing the doors
on this bus.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.232
I got the front door lined up.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.167
My gaps are pretty decent
on the front door.

27:17.203 --> 27:20.404
The rear door is pretty bad.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.306
It doesn't line up at all.

27:22.341 --> 27:27.978
The body line doesn't flow
with the actual lines
of the vehicle.

27:28.014 --> 27:33.150
So, what I'm doing right now,
is just cutting the edges that
need to be moved around...

27:34.487 --> 27:36.854
To get our gap even,
and then I'm going to come in

27:36.889 --> 27:40.624
and work this body line,
to get everything to line up.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.863
This is heat stop.

27:45.898 --> 27:51.802
Since I'm gonna be leading
right on the skin of the door,
I don't want the door warping.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.339
So, what this does
is it just stops the heat
from moving beyond,

27:55.374 --> 27:57.808
try to keep the door
as straight as possible.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.543
The side doors
are very important
to this van.

27:59.578 --> 28:00.844
Those doors need
to be lined up

28:00.880 --> 28:03.213
and perfectly straight
to the rest of the side
of the band.

28:03.249 --> 28:06.617
These windows are level
with each other,
but the body lines aren't.

28:06.652 --> 28:09.820
So, it could just be
a discrepancy in the...

28:09.855 --> 28:12.990
In the panel itself
from manufacturing.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.860
Volkswagen was never known
to make the straightest cars
in the world.

28:20.266 --> 28:24.234
Heating it up a little bit
and getting the moisture out
of the steel,

28:24.270 --> 28:26.403
just to make it
as clean as possible.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.078
Using lead
on a vintage vehicle like this

28:34.113 --> 28:36.080
is exactly
what the doctor ordered.

28:36.115 --> 28:39.049
This ensures that we'll be
able to get all of the lines
to line up on the body

28:39.085 --> 28:42.319
without having to cut them
completely apart,
and fix them.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.320
Lots of prep.

28:43.355 --> 28:46.123
The biggest thing
is cleanliness

28:46.158 --> 28:47.958
when you're doing lead,
or else it just won't stick.

28:54.467 --> 28:59.737
The tools we use to spread
the lead are made out of wood,

28:59.772 --> 29:05.142
so we wax the wood to keep
the wood from burning.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.882
It also helps the wood to keep
from sticking to the lead,

29:11.917 --> 29:13.784
so it rolls out
a lot smoother.

29:13.819 --> 29:15.552
It's difficult
on a vertical panel,

29:15.588 --> 29:17.855
because it wants to slide off.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.894
Got the lead on,
got it all smoothed out.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.996
Now, I've just been
blocking it out

29:26.031 --> 29:28.432
and changing my line
a little bit,

29:28.467 --> 29:33.170
to line up
with that front line,
and it looks awesome.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.905
We can send it over to body
and get it finished up.

29:37.877 --> 29:41.812
The doors may be ready
to head to body now,
but other parts,

29:41.847 --> 29:42.780
not so much.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.748
This is very gross.

29:45.851 --> 29:46.984
It's pretty bad.

29:53.692 --> 29:57.661
[dave givens] what I've done
is I've blown apart
all the original brake system

29:57.696 --> 29:58.962
and all the bearings
are coming out.

30:00.699 --> 30:05.836
We are full speed ahead
on this 1953 vw
barn door deluxe bus,

30:05.871 --> 30:07.271
and before it goes over
the body shop,

30:07.306 --> 30:09.640
we got a couple
of odds and ends
that we just need to tie up.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.375
We're upgrading our
brake system.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.312
We're going
from the old drum system
up to a disc brake system.

30:15.347 --> 30:18.882
We got a lot more horsepower,
so we got to have a lot more
stopping power.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.584
This is very gross.

30:29.562 --> 30:34.832
We're gonna use parts cleaner
to get all this grease off.

30:37.203 --> 30:41.138
These are all the parts
that aren't needed
to be replaced,

30:41.173 --> 30:43.841
and I wanted
all that old grease,

30:43.876 --> 30:45.776
with all the grit
that's in it, out.

30:45.811 --> 30:48.645
So, when I repack
all the grease where...

30:48.681 --> 30:51.615
It's gonna be running smooth
and less wear.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.687
Got everything cleaned up.

30:56.722 --> 31:02.092
Now I got go pack my bearings,
and start putting everything
back together.

31:03.796 --> 31:05.429
We're going to do this
old-school style,

31:05.464 --> 31:09.600
pack it by hand, make a mess.

31:11.904 --> 31:14.805
Packing one side,
overloading it,

31:14.840 --> 31:16.340
and then pressing it,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.342
so it's coming
through the bearing itself.

31:18.377 --> 31:21.745
If you pack it right,
it should be good
until the bearing falls apart.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.681
Now, we've got to put it
all back together.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.430
All put together.

31:41.066 --> 31:42.933
Spinning good. Done.

31:53.946 --> 31:57.281
[dave] since this '53
barn door deluxe bus
arrived at the shop here,

31:57.316 --> 31:58.548
I have been on cloud nine.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.817
-I mean it's a volkswagen.
-Hey-hey!

32:05.324 --> 32:08.492
So far, it's been stripped,
dipped, straightened,

32:08.527 --> 32:11.028
restored and customized.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.462
It looks awesome.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.598
We've done a ton of stuff
to this bus so far,

32:14.633 --> 32:16.533
but really, we're just
getting started.

32:21.807 --> 32:24.474
We got our front beam set up,
taped up,

32:24.510 --> 32:25.709
so we don't scratch anything.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.577
Right now, we're gonna
get it bolted up...

32:30.082 --> 32:31.949
Make sure everything is square
and even.

32:35.087 --> 32:38.088
Before we can get this bus
finished up in the metal shop
and over to body,

32:38.123 --> 32:39.289
we got to make sure it rolls.

32:39.325 --> 32:43.160
There's some tubes in there
that are blocking our path.

32:44.063 --> 32:46.596
-Do we roll it?
-Yeah.

32:50.903 --> 32:55.339
And as always,
there's no perfect tool
for just any old problem.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.210
Easy, cowboy.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.581
Slide forward.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.120
Sometimes, it's just a matter
of muscle power.

33:10.856 --> 33:11.822
Got it in.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.190
I think we're pretty
much good to go.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.858
Pretty big moment
for this vehicle.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.601
Now, with all the metal
finishing done

33:24.636 --> 33:25.736
and in the rear rearview
mirror,

33:25.771 --> 33:28.205
it's time to get this bad boy
over to the body shop.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.641
Taking it over brandon's crew.
They'll sand it down
and make it look pretty.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.611
I just really hope
the metal guys aren't too sad
to see this thing go.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.879
I love seeing them come
over to body.

33:35.914 --> 33:38.348
That means we're done
over on our side.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.958
I'm extremely excited
for this one.

33:47.993 --> 33:52.329
The bus has been designed
and signed off on,
except for one little detail.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.232
The wheels.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.039
So cool to get this far
into the business

34:02.074 --> 34:03.740
and to find out
that pretty much anything

34:03.776 --> 34:06.843
that we can dream up
and design up,
even if I just sketch it,

34:06.879 --> 34:09.813
I've got the right
professionals that know
how to put this stuff together

34:09.848 --> 34:11.314
and do the job right.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.883
I want to do something
that's a little bit unique

34:12.918 --> 34:18.188
kind of that essence of german
1960s volkswagen, porsche.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.957
Really,
to keep stance well set,

34:20.993 --> 34:23.026
I really need to run
a 15 up front.

34:23.062 --> 34:26.096
And then in the back,
I'm gonna go ahead and see
if I can actually fit a 17.

34:26.131 --> 34:28.498
So, we'll have two different
sizes of tires and rims.

34:28.534 --> 34:30.734
But I'm actually gonna
invert the center,

34:30.769 --> 34:32.169
where the center cap will go,

34:32.204 --> 34:33.336
but the really big trick
about these,

34:33.372 --> 34:36.073
and that is these
little u-shaped pieces

34:36.108 --> 34:37.474
that basically
it's a trim ring.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.143
Those will be bolted on
from the back side of the rim.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.712
So, we can paint very easily
the inside center,

34:42.748 --> 34:45.382
and then we'll chrome
these little pieces
and bolt them on afterwards.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.117
I think that'll be
a really nice detail,

34:47.152 --> 34:48.685
and something
that's kind of unique
for the bus.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.258
All right, brandon.

34:55.294 --> 34:58.762
So the metal shop has worked
their magic on this bus.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.099
Let's get this thing primed,
bodywork laser-straight.

35:02.134 --> 35:04.000
I wasn't a huge fan
of this bus when it came,

35:04.036 --> 35:06.169
but this thing's turning out
incredibly cool.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.573
This thing's flowing
really good
and coming along smooth.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.908
[kevin]
there was just so much work
everywhere on this thing,

35:11.944 --> 35:13.577
from the doors getting worked,

35:13.612 --> 35:16.513
to all of the hinges
and floor mods,

35:16.548 --> 35:19.049
all these areas
getting worked over.

35:19.084 --> 35:22.452
Getting a vehicle ready
for paint in this shop
is no easy task.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.021
Every single nook and cranny
has to be perfect in metal,

35:25.057 --> 35:26.790
before the body shop
will accept it.

35:26.825 --> 35:30.160
I'm super excited for you guys
to do your panel magic
on this thing

35:30.195 --> 35:31.728
and get it just knocked out.

35:31.763 --> 35:35.832
All the rust is gone
and that's what we need
something fresh to start with.

35:35.868 --> 35:40.003
Most importantly, my job
is to not only help brandon
see what needs to be done,

35:40.038 --> 35:41.905
but get him
in the volkswagen spirit.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.279
-It's just getting--
-it's so hot in here, dude.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.981
[laughing] oh, my god!

35:51.016 --> 35:53.850
I'm not sure if kevdog's shirt
is motivating
or a distraction.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.685
[laughing] that
tie-dye shirt's killing me.

35:55.721 --> 35:59.723
I was thinking and just...
This is just an idea,

35:59.758 --> 36:03.326
do you want me to get you
and your crew some of these,
while you're doing this?

36:03.362 --> 36:07.130
I think it might get you
in the spirit to just do
an even better job

36:07.166 --> 36:08.431
than you guys already do.

36:08.467 --> 36:11.334
The way I see it,
anybody working on these
vintage volkswagens

36:11.370 --> 36:12.536
should definitely
wear tie dyes.

36:12.571 --> 36:13.537
That's very freeing.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.140
Very embarrassing.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.609
-Peace.
-Hair grease.

36:21.146 --> 36:23.246
Dude, that's legit.
I might wear this all day.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.629
[dave] first things first.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.464
Before we can start
to perfect the bodywork,

36:41.500 --> 36:45.435
we gotta make sure
this thing is completely
straight, aligned and clean.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.245
Good to go.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.581
Bodywork is by far
one of the most
important steps

36:57.616 --> 36:59.149
of building a car
at kindig-it design.

36:59.184 --> 37:02.919
It takes a lot of time,
a lot of effort,
a lot of steps,

37:02.955 --> 37:04.788
and a lot of talent.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.623
The metal has been brought
down to 80 grit.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.726
It's got the good bite in it
for mechanical adhesion
of the primer itself,

37:09.761 --> 37:11.795
but we also want to make sure
we prevent any flash rust

37:11.830 --> 37:13.430
between when that was
completed

37:13.465 --> 37:14.497
and we get the primer
on there.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.833
So, what we do is,
we have a pre-metal treatment

37:16.868 --> 37:19.803
and that prevents the rust
from happening on the metal.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.304
This basically
will seal the metal

37:21.340 --> 37:23.340
and make sure
that all of the bodywork
is down

37:23.375 --> 37:24.941
and is protected underneath.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.843
This stuff
is very dangerous chemically,

37:26.878 --> 37:28.245
so we're definitely
gonna make sure,

37:28.280 --> 37:32.315
like always, I'm all suited up
and got my goggles,
my respirator,

37:32.351 --> 37:34.017
and nothing getting
in my eyes,

37:34.052 --> 37:36.453
or breathing it in
if I don't have to.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.990
We could have
a beautiful shiny paint job,
we top her off,

37:40.025 --> 37:42.292
and it can go out
in the sunlight a week later,

37:42.327 --> 37:44.628
and crack, if all the metal
wasn't properly prepared.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.063
So, this is all very critical
to making sure

37:47.099 --> 37:49.899
that everything
that we do here
from the next month on out

37:49.935 --> 37:50.900
working on it are perfect.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.869
That's it.
Don't drink it, don't eat it.

37:53.805 --> 37:54.771
Wear your masks.

37:56.642 --> 37:59.709
If your boots don't match
your primer suit,
you're not doing it right.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.111
Kind of working it
a little bit.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.147
It's club brian up in this.

38:04.182 --> 38:05.949
Frankie fender's in the booth.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.831
There's a lot to wrap
your head around when putting
this protective coat on,

38:21.867 --> 38:24.567
and brian is here to make sure
it's done flawlessly.

38:37.149 --> 38:41.718
Now brian gets very upset
if you don't properly clean
the guns and for good reason.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.486
Like new.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.354
Brian?

38:44.389 --> 38:45.989
He's a tough nut to crack.

38:46.024 --> 38:49.259
He seemed incredibly happy
with the epoxy.

38:49.294 --> 38:52.228
I think the key on this one
is just to keep him dancing.

38:52.264 --> 38:53.963
Let's mix up a gallon.

39:07.913 --> 39:10.647
With primer, it's so important
that you mix it correctly.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.415
Because if you don't,
it won't cure.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.084
And then all of a sudden,
you'll be sanding,

39:14.119 --> 39:15.952
and then all of a sudden
you're sanding a swamp,

39:15.987 --> 39:17.554
and nobody wants
to sand a swamp.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.989
Precision mixing is the key.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.459
That's something frank
would say.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.661
You just have
to pay attention to detail
with everything you're doing

39:24.696 --> 39:27.030
and think a couple steps ahead
of what's happening.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.366
So, if you don't mix
all this stuff up properly,

39:29.401 --> 39:30.734
the paint on top of it
is just gonna fail,

39:30.769 --> 39:32.102
because the primer
is gonna be soft.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.744
You can see distinctly
the actual primer itself,

39:40.779 --> 39:43.346
the hardener
and kind of some
of the reducer that's up here.

39:43.382 --> 39:46.216
This isn't as sexy
and cool as the actual color

39:46.251 --> 39:47.350
and the base coat going down,

39:47.386 --> 39:49.753
but everything
that we do here
has a step to it,

39:49.788 --> 39:51.187
and a little technique.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.258
[kevin]
primer may not be as sexy
as paint,

39:55.293 --> 39:56.860
but it is so important.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.361
It fills
all the imperfections.

39:58.397 --> 40:01.531
It gives you a nice even base
to continue to sand,

40:01.566 --> 40:03.800
and make this thing
as straight as possible.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.703
I want everything
to be one homogenous,

40:06.738 --> 40:09.406
I think that's the right word,
homogeneous mix,

40:09.441 --> 40:12.041
just like a good whole
chocolate milk or something.

40:14.479 --> 40:15.378
Moment of truth.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.312
If you don't put this
on right,

40:16.348 --> 40:18.915
when you flip it over,
dump out on you.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.717
I learned that when I started.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.952
All right, good to go.
Let's do this.

40:30.996 --> 40:31.795
Let's do this.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.373
The first primer is now
down on this '53 bus.

40:43.408 --> 40:46.810
This is basically your
foundation for the bodywork
and a perfect paint job.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.369
The epoxy primer
came out flawlessly.

41:13.405 --> 41:14.637
Now it's time to get dusty.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.272
Make this thing
laser-straight.

41:17.309 --> 41:18.741
It's been blocked down.

41:18.777 --> 41:21.211
Just need to go and sand out
all the little spot welds,

41:21.246 --> 41:24.380
so this way we get good
adhesion for the body filler
that'll cover those in.

41:24.416 --> 41:27.984
Really just as simple
as getting a little fine pad
in there and work those out.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.154
We're getting it
to where it needs
to be perfect.

41:31.189 --> 41:35.124
This bus will be restored
and customized beyond
what it ever started as.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.695
But in the end, on this bus,
it'll all be
in the small details.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.930
[frank] it's tedious little
stuff like this that makes
the difference,

41:40.966 --> 41:43.466
because if you don't do
something like this now,

41:43.502 --> 41:44.501
spread body filler over that,

41:44.536 --> 41:45.768
it's not really gonna stick,

41:45.804 --> 41:47.871
and it can wind up
lifting in the end

41:47.906 --> 41:49.405
and killing a really pretty
paint job.

41:49.441 --> 41:52.208
So take the time,
do the job right.

41:52.244 --> 41:53.543
It'll look good in the end.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.261
Just get her nice and flat.

42:11.296 --> 42:15.265
Most people
will never see it,
but still make them perfect.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.540
Sweating bullets!

42:23.575 --> 42:26.075
Yeah, you don't need a gym
after doing this.
[laughs]

42:29.781 --> 42:31.981
why is everything taller
than I can reach?

42:34.953 --> 42:36.986
Man, what... What is this?

42:38.223 --> 42:40.290
That's not working, man.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.192
This is irregular glove here.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.395
I can see why harlan's
sweating bullets.

42:45.430 --> 42:47.797
This next part
of the bus project
is a big deal,

42:47.832 --> 42:50.099
and there's absolutely no room
for error.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.068
There we go.

42:52.103 --> 42:55.738
It's the first big spray job
at kindig-it, you know.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.373
That's what makes me
the most nervous, really.

42:58.843 --> 43:01.144
Everything's fine. I got this.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.245
It's gonna be beautiful.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.848
It's only the rarest
volkswagen micro bus barn door

43:05.884 --> 43:10.019
23 window samba in america,
and it's a kindig car.
No pressure.

43:10.055 --> 43:13.122
I want it to be beautiful,
I want it to be one and done,

43:13.158 --> 43:15.558
and something I can be
very proud of.

43:15.594 --> 43:18.561
The guys that have done
the bodywork on this bus
have done an amazing job,

43:18.597 --> 43:20.763
and I have no intention
of losing momentum now.

43:20.799 --> 43:23.866
All right, let's go.
