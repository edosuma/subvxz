00:43.094 --> 00:45.629
Daddy, wake up.

00:54.038 --> 00:55.072
Daddy, wake up.

01:01.012 --> 01:03.547
Come on, come on.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.414
One, two, three.

01:04.447 --> 01:05.081
One,

01:05.116 --> 01:05.950
two,

01:05.983 --> 01:07.484
three, four, five.

01:07.517 --> 01:08.953
Come on, wake up.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.623
Did you see the
track marks on her?

01:14.691 --> 01:15.525
Nothing?

01:15.559 --> 01:16.560
No pulse.

01:16.593 --> 01:18.095
All right, I got it.

01:18.129 --> 01:19.030
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay.

01:19.063 --> 01:19.931
All right.

01:21.598 --> 01:22.699
Ready, clear.

01:26.469 --> 01:27.404
No pulse.

01:28.105 --> 01:29.774
Clear.

01:31.142 --> 01:32.742
Still no pulse.

01:32.777 --> 01:35.112
Come on, come on.

01:35.146 --> 01:36.113
Call it.

01:36.147 --> 01:37.514
No, no, no.

01:37.547 --> 01:38.149
No, let's just do
it one more time.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.851
All right.

01:39.884 --> 01:40.751
Clear.

01:43.087 --> 01:44.155
All right, here we go.

01:47.758 --> 01:49.459
- Quick.
- Yes.

01:49.492 --> 01:50.594
Yeah.

01:50.627 --> 01:51.695
We got a pulse.

01:51.728 --> 01:52.696
Okay.

01:52.729 --> 01:53.865
We got a pulse.

01:53.898 --> 01:55.066
- We got a pulse.
- All right, all right.

01:55.099 --> 01:56.033
That's what I'm
talking about, okay.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.168
Up high, man.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.035
All right.

01:59.003 --> 02:00.637
Okay.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.836
Get off me.

02:31.869 --> 02:34.105
Look at her feet.

02:34.138 --> 02:37.975
Sir, you cannot call
EMT for swollen feet.

02:38.009 --> 02:39.542
Make sure to get
her to the doctor

02:39.576 --> 02:41.711
to get them checked, okay.

02:48.685 --> 02:49.519
Oh my god.

02:49.552 --> 02:50.187
Ricky.

02:50.221 --> 02:52.223
My son, is he okay?

02:52.256 --> 02:53.590
No, how is he?

02:54.591 --> 02:55.960
He's okay.

02:55.993 --> 02:57.527
Okay.

03:07.671 --> 03:08.538
Jonathan.

03:08.571 --> 03:09.472
Hey Tim.

03:09.506 --> 03:11.075
Quiet tonight, huh.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.044
God's smiling down
on his children.

03:13.077 --> 03:14.211
Yeah.

03:14.245 --> 03:15.445
Here you go.

03:18.215 --> 03:20.184
May God bless you sir.

03:20.217 --> 03:21.218
You have a nice evening.

03:21.252 --> 03:23.220
All right.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.225
Night's getting
interesting already.

03:28.259 --> 03:29.961
You need to hydrate, bruh.

03:29.994 --> 03:30.828
Oh, thanks.

03:30.861 --> 03:32.797
Too much coffee, man.

03:35.866 --> 03:37.835
You look happy.

03:37.868 --> 03:41.238
Eh, nah, it's just
my usual face, man.

03:41.272 --> 03:42.739
Oh yeah.

03:42.773 --> 03:45.176
So, did you talk to her?

03:45.209 --> 03:46.844
Who?

03:46.877 --> 03:48.578
You know who, Francesca.

03:48.611 --> 03:49.880
Oh.

03:49.914 --> 03:52.716
I mean, I said, hi, you know.

03:52.749 --> 03:54.718
She heard me this time.

03:55.786 --> 03:57.654
Did she say hi back?

03:58.756 --> 03:59.622
Yep.

04:01.892 --> 04:03.094
That's pretty good.

04:03.127 --> 04:04.728
It's only taken you
what, six months?

04:04.762 --> 04:06.831
Hey, I'm working on it, man.

04:06.864 --> 04:07.832
- Relax.
- Sure, sure.

04:07.865 --> 04:09.033
- Relax.
- Sure.

04:09.066 --> 04:10.001
I just need a
little more time.

04:10.034 --> 04:10.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.268
Hey.

04:11.302 --> 04:12.502
Got a light?

04:14.905 --> 04:16.639
Are you serious?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.276
Yeah, bad for
my health, right?

04:23.080 --> 04:23.948
Man.

04:26.884 --> 04:29.186
I don't know, sometimes man,

04:29.220 --> 04:31.621
it's just doesn't
make any sense.

04:31.654 --> 04:32.622
What?

04:32.655 --> 04:33.924
Idiots like her?

04:35.692 --> 04:36.894
I don't know.

04:38.029 --> 04:39.764
That's crazy, man.

04:41.664 --> 04:42.665
Yeah.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.101
I mean,

04:44.135 --> 04:45.002
look,

04:45.970 --> 04:48.305
I guess the only way
I can make sense of it

04:48.339 --> 04:50.174
is to believe that
there's something more

04:50.207 --> 04:52.575
beyond this life, man.

04:52.609 --> 04:56.280
I mean, this can't
be all there is bro.

04:56.313 --> 04:59.682
God's got a much
bigger plan, trust me.

05:01.152 --> 05:03.287
Yeah, what, like Heaven?

05:05.222 --> 05:06.090
Yeah.

05:07.091 --> 05:07.958
Heaven.

05:12.096 --> 05:14.731
It's gotta be better than this.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.535
I hope so.

05:20.004 --> 05:21.138
Me too, man.

05:22.705 --> 05:23.573
Me too.

05:26.077 --> 05:26.911
Daddy,

05:26.944 --> 05:28.379
time to wake up.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.280
Wake up.

05:36.987 --> 05:38.122
Who is that?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.194
Where am I?

05:48.132 --> 05:49.266
Wake up!

07:56.193 --> 07:57.228
Honey.

07:57.261 --> 07:58.929
Sorry.

07:58.963 --> 08:00.764
My hospital appointment.

08:00.798 --> 08:03.033
Oh, oh, yeah, okay.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.935
All right, here we go.

08:06.503 --> 08:08.372
Oh man, I hate
this piece of junk.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.140
Hey now, hey stop.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.378
Don't be hating on old Betsy.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.080
Betsy?

08:16.113 --> 08:17.248
Yeah, Betsy, her name.

08:17.281 --> 08:18.949
Don't you remember?

08:22.286 --> 08:24.521
Since when did Betsy
become the official name

08:24.555 --> 08:26.090
of this old truck?

08:26.123 --> 08:27.391
It's official.

08:28.826 --> 08:32.029
Pops had her as long
as I can remember.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.799
Until he gave her to us.

08:37.001 --> 08:37.868
And here,

08:39.035 --> 08:41.038
yep, there it is.

08:41.071 --> 08:43.006
She's got her trusty roadmap.

08:43.039 --> 08:43.907
Yeah.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.911
I think it's time for change.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.513
We can't afford a new car.

08:49.546 --> 08:52.082
No, no, you can get a great
new lease at the moment.

08:52.116 --> 08:53.984
You know, no money
down and drive away.

08:54.018 --> 08:54.985
It's great.

08:55.019 --> 08:56.020
Great.

08:56.053 --> 08:56.920
- Get me a new truck...
- Great,

08:56.954 --> 08:57.888
add that to our mortgage

08:57.921 --> 09:00.858
and our insurance and copay.

09:00.891 --> 09:01.859
Oh.

09:01.892 --> 09:03.160
Wait.

09:03.193 --> 09:04.061
See, see.

09:04.995 --> 09:06.130
There you go.

09:06.163 --> 09:07.498
She's a reliable old broad.

09:07.531 --> 09:08.399
Good job.

09:10.334 --> 09:11.302
What?

09:11.335 --> 09:12.303
Don't say it.

09:12.336 --> 09:13.304
Don't say it.

09:13.337 --> 09:14.471
I know you're going to say it.

09:14.505 --> 09:15.572
I wasn't going to
say just like you.

09:15.606 --> 09:16.540
Ugh.

09:16.573 --> 09:18.809
But you are a reliable.

09:19.877 --> 09:21.312
It's the truth, truth.

09:21.345 --> 09:22.946
And you are old,

09:24.081 --> 09:26.116
old soul, I should
say, old soul.

09:26.150 --> 09:26.984
Okay.

09:27.017 --> 09:28.285
Okay, oh, old soul.

09:28.319 --> 09:30.387
Put your seat.

09:30.421 --> 09:32.956
I don't know, it's really old.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.091
I think it's cool,

09:34.124 --> 09:35.926
it's got personality.

09:37.094 --> 09:38.429
Yeah.

09:38.462 --> 09:41.332
Old Betsy is very
reliable, isn't she?

09:41.365 --> 09:43.267
Betsy, is that what
you call her pops?

09:43.300 --> 09:44.935
- Yeah.
- Betsy.

09:44.968 --> 09:46.370
Do you like her?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.474
You're going to need that.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.475
What, need, what?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.444
The roadmap.

09:53.477 --> 09:56.313
Oh no, see they have
these things called GPS now.

09:56.347 --> 09:57.548
It's a, it's pretty new,

09:57.581 --> 09:59.550
but much more reliable
than a map, so.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.218
Hmm.

10:01.251 --> 10:04.888
Not more liable
than that road map.

10:04.922 --> 10:06.357
He's talking about the Bible.

10:06.390 --> 10:08.025
Oh yeah.

10:08.058 --> 10:09.493
Does this have maps on it?

10:09.526 --> 10:11.362
I mean, I guess if we
were in the middle east,

10:11.395 --> 10:12.529
it'd be pretty useful.

10:15.933 --> 10:18.235
It's a map to God, Jonathan.

10:18.268 --> 10:19.470
Okay, yeah.

10:19.503 --> 10:22.439
Well I'm not really into
that sort of stuff, so.

10:22.473 --> 10:24.475
Well, all I can say is

10:25.676 --> 10:27.478
I'll do a deal with you.

10:27.511 --> 10:28.612
Okay?

10:28.645 --> 10:30.247
Yeah, now we're talking.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.384
Well, you may not like it, but

10:33.417 --> 10:34.618
I will give you

10:35.619 --> 10:37.254
this truck for free.

10:37.287 --> 10:38.422
Free?

10:38.455 --> 10:40.391
Wait, really pops?

10:40.424 --> 10:42.659
On one condition.

10:42.693 --> 10:43.560
Okay.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.965
You leave the roadmap

10:47.998 --> 10:51.535
in the glove box, just in
case you need it one day.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.506
Cause you can't always
rely on the PGSs, SPGs.

10:55.539 --> 10:56.373
GPS.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.142
That.

10:58.175 --> 10:59.309
- Yeah.
- Right.

11:01.378 --> 11:05.249
I know may seem like
a lot of nonsense.

11:05.282 --> 11:09.052
Some stories that had no
relevance to you right now.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.021
But I was just like you

11:12.189 --> 11:15.993
and a time came in my
life when I was lost.

11:16.026 --> 11:18.695
And if it wasn't
for that roadmap,

11:20.431 --> 11:23.167
I would never have been found.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.507
Okay.

11:31.475 --> 11:32.543
It's staying.

11:37.214 --> 11:38.582
But, but wait,

11:38.615 --> 11:41.051
don't you mean you
wouldn't have found it

11:41.084 --> 11:44.388
because like how
could a map find you?

11:44.421 --> 11:45.289
It's.

11:46.323 --> 11:47.991
Yeah, you'll see.

11:55.466 --> 11:56.633
You'll understand later.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.035
You'll understand later.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.436
- I'll see.
- Okay.

12:18.555 --> 12:19.423
Well,

12:20.524 --> 12:22.593
the doctor seems
positive about this,

12:22.626 --> 12:23.627
this round.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.396
Yeah, well we'll see.

12:26.430 --> 12:29.266
No, I think this is
the one that's gonna,

12:29.299 --> 12:31.134
this is the one that's
going to do it, you know.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.282
It's the 12th today.

12:47.451 --> 12:48.452
I thought,

12:50.454 --> 12:51.789
I thought you weren't
gonna remember that,

12:51.823 --> 12:53.090
you know, with
everything going on.

12:53.123 --> 12:54.124
No.

12:54.157 --> 12:55.325
I never forget.

13:05.435 --> 13:06.503
You look tired.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.371
Oh.

13:09.306 --> 13:10.140
I am.

13:11.141 --> 13:12.743
No, I mean, not just today.

13:12.777 --> 13:14.177
I mean, for the last few months

13:14.211 --> 13:16.814
you've been looking tired.

13:16.848 --> 13:17.681
Yeah,

13:17.714 --> 13:19.383
It's all,

13:19.416 --> 13:21.251
night shift work and stuff.

13:21.285 --> 13:22.586
Yeah, it's ever since they
put you on graveyard shift.

13:22.619 --> 13:23.487
Yeah.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.424
Well it's more money, so.

13:31.461 --> 13:35.833
I don't think you
should work there anymore.

13:35.867 --> 13:36.733
Well,

13:37.701 --> 13:38.836
I can't,

13:38.870 --> 13:41.572
I can't just change
jobs, you know.

13:43.173 --> 13:45.275
Well, you could,

13:45.309 --> 13:48.278
you could find a different
job in the same department.

13:48.312 --> 13:50.180
You said there's
that manager position

13:50.213 --> 13:52.149
that they were
opening up, right?

13:52.182 --> 13:53.350
Normal hours.

13:53.383 --> 13:54.518
Normal shifts.

13:55.753 --> 13:58.722
You wouldn't walk around
like a zombie vampire.

14:00.557 --> 14:01.391
Thanks.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.292
Yeah.

14:03.627 --> 14:05.763
Yeah, no look, it's,

14:05.797 --> 14:06.864
they just get really weird

14:06.898 --> 14:08.800
when you try to change things

14:08.833 --> 14:09.666
when you ask for new positions...

14:09.700 --> 14:10.768
Jonathan.

14:10.802 --> 14:13.871
You don't know, unless you ask.

14:13.905 --> 14:15.907
I mean, I didn't know if you
wanted to go on a date with me

14:15.940 --> 14:16.908
until I asked.

14:18.275 --> 14:18.910
I had a plan.

14:18.943 --> 14:20.310
I was working on it.

14:20.344 --> 14:21.846
Yeah, yeah, you had a plan.

14:21.879 --> 14:23.815
And it all fell through
at the last minute.

14:23.848 --> 14:24.681
Okay.

14:24.715 --> 14:27.217
Well you procrastinate.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.619
You get stuck in that,

14:28.652 --> 14:30.253
that head of yours

14:31.388 --> 14:33.523
and just overthink things.

14:35.492 --> 14:38.629
Oh, I think
you're running late.

14:38.662 --> 14:41.899
See, sometimes it's
good to over think.

14:43.333 --> 14:44.201
Okay.

14:45.736 --> 14:48.806
Do you want me to come in?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.173
No.

14:50.207 --> 14:51.608
I want you to go home
and get some rest.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.509
Okay.

14:56.279 --> 14:57.447
Just give it a push.

14:57.481 --> 14:58.482
Give it a push,
know how it works.

14:58.515 --> 14:59.716
I know Betsy.

15:01.518 --> 15:02.519
See, I know.

15:03.955 --> 15:05.255
I'm gonna get
that boulder out.

15:05.288 --> 15:06.623
I've got a plan.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.258
You know what
your plan should be,

15:08.291 --> 15:09.726
to get some help.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.429
Oh, don't forget.

15:13.865 --> 15:14.832
Okay.

15:14.866 --> 15:16.533
- I got it.
- Yeah.

15:29.981 --> 15:33.951
I know it's not
the ideal situation.

15:33.985 --> 15:36.921
It would be worse to
try and do this now.

15:36.954 --> 15:38.790
I still don't have a job

15:38.823 --> 15:40.290
and you just lost yours.

15:40.323 --> 15:42.359
Your brother said we
could stay with him.

15:42.392 --> 15:43.293
Yeah.

15:43.326 --> 15:44.361
You know how he is?

15:44.394 --> 15:45.997
He's super religious.

15:46.030 --> 15:47.397
No, he's not.

15:47.431 --> 15:48.298
He's.

15:50.734 --> 15:54.504
He's got faith in
something bigger than this.

15:55.940 --> 15:58.408
I think that's a good thing.

15:59.342 --> 16:01.578
But you're not religious.

16:01.611 --> 16:02.814
And you always said

16:02.847 --> 16:04.548
you didn't want to turn
out like your parents.

16:04.581 --> 16:06.349
Like if God was real,

16:07.718 --> 16:11.688
why would there be so much
suffering in this world?

16:13.958 --> 16:18.896
But how does that determine
whether there's a God or not?

16:19.797 --> 16:21.231
I don't know.

16:22.733 --> 16:23.768
It just does.

16:25.970 --> 16:27.370
I don't know.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.009
I thought I knew.

16:35.913 --> 16:36.881
I guess I don't.

16:36.914 --> 16:37.782
It just,

16:40.985 --> 16:42.854
it doesn't feel right.

16:48.391 --> 16:49.392
Elizabeth,

16:50.393 --> 16:52.395
what options do we have?

17:08.813 --> 17:12.348
Hey, do you want me
to come in with you?

17:17.621 --> 17:18.655
No.

18:12.742 --> 18:16.113
Hey, I need to talk
to Elizabeth Spencer.

18:16.147 --> 18:17.447
I'm sorry, sir.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.515
We cannot give out
personal information.

18:18.548 --> 18:20.550
No, I need to talk to her.

18:20.584 --> 18:21.518
Sir.

18:21.551 --> 18:25.056
You need to leave or
we will call security.

18:52.183 --> 18:53.050
Did you?

19:13.570 --> 19:14.939
This is just so

19:16.774 --> 19:17.641
wow.

19:23.546 --> 19:25.448
Do you know where I am?

19:25.482 --> 19:27.885
Of course I do.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.154
Yeah,

19:30.187 --> 19:31.756
where am I?

19:31.789 --> 19:33.523
You know.

19:33.556 --> 19:36.193
No, I really don't
know where I am.

19:36.227 --> 19:37.560
Yes, you do.

19:38.963 --> 19:39.830
I do?

19:43.901 --> 19:44.769
Is this,

19:46.736 --> 19:47.805
is this heaven?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.840
I told you would know.

19:52.509 --> 19:53.177
Whoa.

19:55.012 --> 19:56.613
There must be some mistake.

19:56.646 --> 19:58.249
I shouldn't be here.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.482
I had so much more to do...

19:59.516 --> 20:00.684
Forget what is behind

20:00.717 --> 20:02.485
and look to what is ahead.

20:02.519 --> 20:03.154
Yeah.

20:03.187 --> 20:05.089
No, no, no, no, no.

20:05.122 --> 20:06.523
I mean, I was never any good.

20:06.556 --> 20:07.758
I failed at everything.

20:07.792 --> 20:08.993
I was terrible with my faith.

20:09.026 --> 20:10.227
I never went to church.

20:10.261 --> 20:12.029
I was hopeless at my job.

20:12.063 --> 20:12.964
I mean surely.

20:14.265 --> 20:16.767
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

20:16.801 --> 20:18.568
Jonathan, you're not dressed.

20:18.601 --> 20:19.569
What?

20:19.602 --> 20:20.704
Church.

20:20.737 --> 20:21.906
Church, you remember
that, don't you?

20:21.939 --> 20:23.673
I got the game on.

20:25.009 --> 20:27.278
Oh, come on, come on,
we have to go to church.

20:27.311 --> 20:30.714
Pastor Steve asked us to go
to lunch at his house after.

20:30.747 --> 20:32.283
I have have nothing
in common with that guy.

20:32.316 --> 20:33.750
Well, you have
one thing in common.

20:33.784 --> 20:34.617
Yeah?

20:34.651 --> 20:35.585
Yeah, Jesus.

20:35.618 --> 20:38.588
He likes to talk about Jesus.

20:38.621 --> 20:40.024
Yeah.

20:40.057 --> 20:41.759
No, I mean, seriously, you,

20:41.792 --> 20:43.127
you have all those questions.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.562
This is a great opportunity
to get them answered.

20:45.595 --> 20:46.730
So when you're
trying to, you know,

20:46.764 --> 20:48.966
act really intelligent
at small group.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.135
What do you mean trying to?

20:51.168 --> 20:52.003
Come on,

20:53.170 --> 20:54.005
come on.

20:54.038 --> 20:56.107
DVR the game, let's go.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.741
Can you at least
leave the pie?

20:57.775 --> 20:59.609
No, you're not to eat it all.

20:59.642 --> 21:01.879
Yeah, but last time
I only got one slice.

21:01.912 --> 21:02.880
That's good.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.115
Your doctor would be happy.

21:04.148 --> 21:06.616
That's just code
for saying I'm fat.

21:06.649 --> 21:07.284
All right,

21:09.320 --> 21:10.888
okay, let's do it.

21:20.630 --> 21:21.265
Hi Elizabeth.

21:21.298 --> 21:22.867
This is Dr. Howard.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.169
Could you please call me
back as soon as possible?

21:25.202 --> 21:26.070
Thank you.

21:30.808 --> 21:32.575
The most important thing

21:32.609 --> 21:34.045
was that in all the doubts,

21:34.078 --> 21:36.013
fears, worries,

21:36.047 --> 21:38.249
and all the times you
stumbled and fell,

21:38.282 --> 21:40.051
you still believed.

21:40.084 --> 21:41.684
It's always about the heart.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.620
Even at the lowest point,

21:43.653 --> 21:45.256
you still believed.

21:45.289 --> 21:46.723
It's on the inside,

21:46.757 --> 21:48.826
not what's on the outside.

21:48.859 --> 21:50.261
Only man looks at that.

21:50.294 --> 21:52.163
But God looks at this.

21:55.866 --> 21:56.699
Huh.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.070
I still have a pulse.

21:59.103 --> 22:01.138
You have a lot to learn.

22:01.172 --> 22:04.041
But we have all of
eternity to learn.

22:04.075 --> 22:06.743
Aren't we supposed to
be wearing like robes

22:06.777 --> 22:09.113
and have wings and halos?

22:09.146 --> 22:11.949
Should I be playing
a harp or something?

22:11.982 --> 22:12.749
Oh, wait.

22:50.921 --> 22:52.056
Jonathan,

22:52.089 --> 22:53.991
Pastor Steve was
asking about my pie.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.392
It's, the recipe is my mom's.

22:55.426 --> 22:56.861
It's really.

22:56.894 --> 22:59.729
Wow, that looks amazing.

22:59.763 --> 23:00.630
Try it.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.934
That's incredible.

23:03.968 --> 23:05.369
The pie's amazing.

23:05.402 --> 23:07.171
It's hands down the best pie
I've ever had, Elizabeth.

23:07.204 --> 23:09.039
Why, thank you, Pastor Steve.

23:09.073 --> 23:11.375
Just call me Steve.

23:11.408 --> 23:13.410
Well, thanks Steve.

23:13.444 --> 23:15.012
Jonathan, you wanna have some,

23:15.045 --> 23:16.380
it's really delicious.

23:16.413 --> 23:18.816
Of course you know that.

23:18.849 --> 23:20.017
Yeah, I do.

23:20.050 --> 23:23.254
Oh, Jonathan's
watching his weight.

23:23.287 --> 23:24.155
Oh yes.

23:25.122 --> 23:25.990
Good idea.

23:27.124 --> 23:29.293
I've been watching
my weight for years.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.761
Still never changes though.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.122
Guys, guys,

23:58.155 --> 23:59.790
Bora Bora this time of the year,

23:59.823 --> 24:00.958
Amazing.

24:00.991 --> 24:01.959
I just got back.

24:01.992 --> 24:04.061
It is beautiful.

24:04.094 --> 24:04.929
All right.

24:04.962 --> 24:07.164
What do you think?

24:07.198 --> 24:08.165
She's a beast.

24:08.199 --> 24:09.466
Hey, check it out, check it out.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.868
Come on.

24:13.003 --> 24:14.305
Yeah, come in here.

24:14.338 --> 24:18.275
Check out that cool
leather interior, smell it.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.879
You know, I can get
you a great deal

24:21.912 --> 24:22.780
on one of these bad boys.

24:22.813 --> 24:23.948
Yeah?

24:23.981 --> 24:26.350
Come on down to the
showroom tomorrow.

24:26.383 --> 24:28.185
Honey.

24:28.219 --> 24:30.221
Yeah, yeah, I'll be a minute.

24:30.254 --> 24:31.989
You're wife is
gonna love this.

24:50.074 --> 24:52.042
So what did Peter want?

24:52.076 --> 24:53.444
Who?

24:53.477 --> 24:55.145
Peter Lock, you know, you
were just talking to him.

24:55.179 --> 24:56.347
He goes to our church.

24:56.380 --> 24:57.348
Oh.

24:57.381 --> 24:59.116
I don't, just stuff.

25:00.884 --> 25:03.520
Did you like his truck?

25:03.554 --> 25:04.555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:04.588 --> 25:05.956
It's pretty cool.

25:05.990 --> 25:07.458
It's kind of like a
smart truck, you know,

25:07.491 --> 25:08.459
it's like a smart house

25:08.492 --> 25:09.994
and it's got all these
kind of cool features.

25:10.027 --> 25:11.862
How much is the lease?

25:11.895 --> 25:13.297
Oh,

25:13.330 --> 25:15.566
he said he's got this
great deal on the loan.

25:15.599 --> 25:18.469
So come on down the
showroom and yeah.

25:18.502 --> 25:19.937
- Yeah.
- Jonathan,

25:19.970 --> 25:20.838
okay.

25:22.139 --> 25:23.907
Look as much as I think
you look really hot

25:23.941 --> 25:25.976
inside of the truck,

25:26.010 --> 25:27.077
the thing is,

25:29.346 --> 25:31.148
I just, you're going
to sign the lease

25:31.181 --> 25:34.051
and then you're
going to be stuck.

25:35.286 --> 25:36.253
Yes.

25:36.287 --> 25:38.088
It's like you won't,

25:38.122 --> 25:39.556
you're not going to
get out of the cycle.

25:39.590 --> 25:41.959
It's just a lease, that's all.

25:41.992 --> 25:42.960
No, it's not the lease.

25:42.993 --> 25:45.429
It's your work, it's your work.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.931
Our bills are gonna pile up.

25:47.965 --> 25:50.301
And this is not
the right time for,

25:50.334 --> 25:51.468
I mean, because what it means

25:51.502 --> 25:53.270
is that you're not
going to be available

25:53.304 --> 25:55.039
to make any changes.

25:55.072 --> 25:56.440
And you're already working a job

25:56.473 --> 25:58.976
that completely exhausts you.

25:59.009 --> 26:00.311
I mean, you'll have a truck.

26:00.344 --> 26:01.312
That would be great.

26:01.345 --> 26:02.946
You have a truck,

26:02.980 --> 26:04.982
but you'll have to take on
more shifts to pay for it.

26:05.015 --> 26:07.918
And you're already burning
the candle at both ends.

26:07.951 --> 26:10.120
A truck is not going
to make you feel good

26:10.154 --> 26:13.190
when you're working on these
night shifts all the time.

26:13.223 --> 26:15.192
Why are you being so
negative all the time?

26:15.225 --> 26:16.160
What do you mean?

26:16.193 --> 26:18.128
I'm not being negative.

26:19.630 --> 26:20.497
This is,

26:22.099 --> 26:24.234
this is not just a truck for me.

26:24.268 --> 26:25.469
This is for both of us.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.938
I know, I know
it's not the truck.

26:27.971 --> 26:28.939
It's your job.

26:28.972 --> 26:30.474
I want you to be
able to be free,

26:30.507 --> 26:34.278
to be able to make changes
in your life for your job.

26:34.311 --> 26:35.913
I can't just make changes.

26:35.946 --> 26:37.114
I keep telling you that.

26:37.147 --> 26:38.649
They don't like it when
you ask for new shifts

26:38.682 --> 26:40.517
and new changes
and all this stuff.

26:40.551 --> 26:41.952
You just think I can do that.

26:41.985 --> 26:42.953
I can't just do that.

26:42.986 --> 26:44.188
I have to get out.

26:44.221 --> 26:45.322
I have to get out of here.

26:45.356 --> 26:46.890
Come on.

26:46.924 --> 26:47.524
You can't just run away every
time we have an argument,

26:47.558 --> 26:48.926
you have to run away.

26:48.959 --> 26:49.626
It's not that, I
just have to get out.

26:49.660 --> 26:50.494
I have to get out.

26:50.527 --> 26:51.428
I'm hurting.

26:51.462 --> 26:53.330
I, I just need some fresh air.

26:53.364 --> 26:54.565
I need to just,

26:56.066 --> 26:57.968
I just need some fresh air.

26:58.001 --> 26:59.036
Okay.

26:59.069 --> 26:59.937
Okay.

27:02.239 --> 27:03.907
- Okay.
- You okay?

27:03.941 --> 27:05.242
Oh, I just need
some fresh air.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.477
I just need,

27:06.510 --> 27:07.644
I just need my,

27:07.678 --> 27:08.979
hold on, hold on.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.948
Are you having a panic attack?

27:10.981 --> 27:11.982
Yeah, maybe.

27:12.015 --> 27:12.683
Maybe.

27:12.716 --> 27:13.984
- Just breathe.
- Okay.

27:14.017 --> 27:14.885
Okay.

27:16.220 --> 27:17.087
Oh, okay.

27:18.155 --> 27:19.022
Okay.

27:19.957 --> 27:20.591
Okay.

27:20.624 --> 27:21.592
Okay.

27:21.625 --> 27:22.493
Okay.

27:26.330 --> 27:27.197
Did you,

27:28.499 --> 27:30.434
do you ever get the results
back from the doctor?

27:30.467 --> 27:31.602
No, not yet.

27:34.371 --> 27:37.174
I'm sure it's
going to be okay.

27:39.676 --> 27:41.645
And if it's not?

27:41.678 --> 27:43.680
It's going to be fine.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.150
Okay, but,

27:48.652 --> 27:50.120
but if it's not,

27:52.356 --> 27:55.325
you just promise me
to leave the job.

27:55.359 --> 27:56.994
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:57.027 --> 27:58.695
Really?

27:58.729 --> 28:00.330
Yeah, I promise.

28:01.365 --> 28:02.433
Okay.

28:02.466 --> 28:03.333
- I feel better now.
- Good.

28:03.367 --> 28:04.234
Okay.

28:06.603 --> 28:07.738
All right.

28:07.772 --> 28:09.039
Now we need to
stop by the store.

28:09.072 --> 28:10.407
Okay, what for?

28:11.542 --> 28:12.342
I need to get
some ingredients.

28:12.376 --> 28:13.444
I'm going to make a pie.

28:13.477 --> 28:14.344
For who?

28:15.780 --> 28:17.014
For you, weirdo.

28:17.047 --> 28:18.582
Yeah, for you.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.684
Okay, that sounds good.

28:24.756 --> 28:28.325
So how long have
I been here for?

28:28.358 --> 28:30.160
Time is an old
fashioned thing now.

28:30.194 --> 28:32.329
You're on eternity time.

28:32.362 --> 28:33.230
Oh.

28:34.231 --> 28:35.767
Is that like dog years?

28:35.800 --> 28:37.401
You know, like one year up here

28:37.434 --> 28:38.735
is seven years in earth?

28:38.770 --> 28:40.471
More like a thousand
years is like a day,

28:40.504 --> 28:42.606
and a day is like
a thousand years.

28:42.639 --> 28:43.507
Oh.

28:45.576 --> 28:46.443
So,

28:48.278 --> 28:49.680
how did I get here?

28:49.713 --> 28:50.647
You know.

28:52.549 --> 28:53.417
I do?

28:58.522 --> 28:59.523
Okay.

29:37.427 --> 29:40.564
Yep, gonna need the old roadmap.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.242
Okay, honey, you win.

29:56.246 --> 29:57.648
Time for a change.

29:59.182 --> 30:00.050
Yeah.

30:02.119 --> 30:02.787
All right.

30:13.196 --> 30:14.464
All right, okay.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.775
It just, I feel so different.

31:01.345 --> 31:03.714
It's hard to explain.

31:03.747 --> 31:04.748
I know.

31:04.782 --> 31:06.249
You used to worry a lot.

31:06.283 --> 31:08.652
Now you will never worry again.

31:08.685 --> 31:09.854
You used to carry

31:09.887 --> 31:12.522
the weight of the
world on you everyday.

31:12.556 --> 31:16.593
That boulder of worry and
fear crushed you constantly.

31:16.627 --> 31:21.164
And now you will never worry
about that burden again.

31:22.299 --> 31:23.734
Yeah.

31:23.768 --> 31:25.435
I feel so peaceful.

31:25.469 --> 31:27.638
And no more fears
and no more tears.

31:27.671 --> 31:29.373
It all gets wiped away.

31:29.406 --> 31:34.411
All those years of pain and
suffering are all gone now.

31:34.912 --> 31:36.480
It's amazing.

31:52.696 --> 31:55.699
Hey, they said you
wanted to talk to me.

31:55.732 --> 31:58.301
Yes, Elizabeth, take a seat.

32:06.276 --> 32:07.310
I thought we
were going to start

32:07.344 --> 32:09.914
another round of
treatment today.

32:11.281 --> 32:12.616
That was correct.

32:12.649 --> 32:13.450
But.

32:17.955 --> 32:19.222
What is it?

32:21.291 --> 32:23.694
I'm afraid it's not good news.

32:23.727 --> 32:24.862
The test came back

32:24.896 --> 32:27.230
and we're at a stage four.

32:28.532 --> 32:30.001
At this point,

32:30.034 --> 32:31.568
the plan is to make sure

32:31.601 --> 32:34.604
you're as comfortable
as you can be.

32:40.277 --> 32:42.279
Hey, don't be sad.

32:42.312 --> 32:43.680
Huh?

32:43.714 --> 32:44.748
God's got it.

32:46.349 --> 32:47.952
Don't worry.

33:16.047 --> 33:16.914
Okay.

33:19.516 --> 33:21.919
Okay, God, maybe you got this.

33:27.759 --> 33:28.625
I don't,

33:32.395 --> 33:33.497
I don't know.

33:34.966 --> 33:36.266
I don't know.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.436
I can only handle so much, God.

33:39.469 --> 33:41.471
It's just getting too much.

33:41.505 --> 33:42.774
This too much.

33:57.855 --> 33:58.722
Okay.

34:02.359 --> 34:04.528
Okay, so I made a mistake.

34:04.561 --> 34:06.063
Maybe I deserve it.

34:14.071 --> 34:14.938
Okay.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.706
Okay.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.543
God, I gotta, I need you so bad.

34:20.577 --> 34:21.545
I need you.

34:23.014 --> 34:25.614
Just help me, help me believe.

34:26.483 --> 34:27.350
Help me.

34:28.985 --> 34:31.487
Help me see beyond this, God.

34:33.891 --> 34:35.793
Oh God, I just need
your peace, God.

34:35.827 --> 34:39.030
Please, please just
give me your peace.

34:41.531 --> 34:42.399
Please.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.541
Okay.

34:51.574 --> 34:52.442
Okay.

34:53.476 --> 34:54.344
Okay.

35:08.558 --> 35:09.559
Come here.

35:44.195 --> 35:45.062
I'm sorry.

35:46.730 --> 35:47.697
I lost track of time.

35:47.731 --> 35:49.066
Oh, you found my phone.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.001
Thanks.

35:50.034 --> 35:51.668
I took an Uber.

35:51.701 --> 35:52.870
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:52.904 --> 35:54.071
Yeah.

35:54.105 --> 35:56.640
Jonathan, you know I
don't ask for a lot.

35:56.673 --> 35:58.776
I just ask for you
to be there for me.

35:58.809 --> 35:59.777
I know.

35:59.810 --> 36:00.710
I don't care about this house.

36:00.744 --> 36:01.745
I don't care about the yard.

36:01.779 --> 36:02.947
I don't care about any of it.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.614
I just want you to
be there for me.

36:04.648 --> 36:05.615
Yeah, I am.

36:05.649 --> 36:08.019
I never see you anymore!

36:08.052 --> 36:10.855
Ever since they put you on
that stupid night shift,

36:10.888 --> 36:11.856
it's not good for you.

36:11.889 --> 36:12.857
It's not good for me.

36:12.890 --> 36:13.891
It's not good for either of us.

36:13.925 --> 36:15.059
All right.

36:15.092 --> 36:16.994
Look, I just need
some more time.

36:17.028 --> 36:18.595
Chuck just said
another six months,

36:18.628 --> 36:21.198
I could get a promotion
and I can get enough money

36:21.232 --> 36:22.233
to fix this house up.

36:22.266 --> 36:23.566
Isn't that what you want?

36:23.600 --> 36:24.567
Is that what you want from me?

36:24.601 --> 36:25.602
That's why I'm doing this.

36:25.635 --> 36:27.504
I'm doing this for us.

36:32.843 --> 36:35.212
I don't have any more time.

36:38.182 --> 36:39.716
It's not working.

36:45.923 --> 36:46.991
No, no, no.

36:49.026 --> 36:49.860
It's gonna work.

36:49.894 --> 36:50.761
No.

36:54.531 --> 36:55.833
Oh.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.220
Jonathan?

37:16.253 --> 37:17.554
Jonathan.

37:17.587 --> 37:19.023
Tim?

37:19.056 --> 37:19.890
It's me.

37:19.924 --> 37:20.758
I.

37:20.791 --> 37:21.792
Oh my gosh.

37:21.826 --> 37:22.827
You're here.

37:24.128 --> 37:25.129
I can't,

37:25.162 --> 37:25.997
I can't believe it.

37:26.030 --> 37:27.564
I mean,

37:27.597 --> 37:29.000
you looks so happy and healthy.

37:29.033 --> 37:30.801
I mean, you always happy,

37:30.835 --> 37:32.003
which I could never
quite understand.

37:32.036 --> 37:33.503
Well, I always

37:35.773 --> 37:36.941
just tried

37:36.974 --> 37:38.641
to hold on to the
hope that one day,

37:38.675 --> 37:40.744
no matter what happened,

37:40.778 --> 37:42.113
I would be here in paradise.

37:42.146 --> 37:43.747
Things were bad sometimes.

37:43.781 --> 37:44.982
I mean they were,

37:45.016 --> 37:47.818
but I could believe
that I would be here

37:47.852 --> 37:49.186
in paradise.

37:49.220 --> 37:50.087
And I am.

37:54.925 --> 37:56.093
That's my family.

37:56.127 --> 37:57.627
You never met them.

37:57.660 --> 37:58.929
- No.
- Yeah.

38:00.097 --> 38:01.032
I lost them

38:02.166 --> 38:03.034
early on,

38:04.301 --> 38:06.569
early on in a house fire.

38:07.271 --> 38:09.606
That's why I was homeless.

38:11.008 --> 38:13.244
See, I was a big,
successful lawyer,

38:13.277 --> 38:14.211
a big shot.

38:15.379 --> 38:17.547
I thought I had it all.

38:19.350 --> 38:21.919
I didn't have anything.

38:21.952 --> 38:24.587
Traveling, always
away from them.

38:24.621 --> 38:27.058
And then one day I got a call.

38:27.091 --> 38:28.225
It's all gone.

38:31.095 --> 38:32.229
It crushed me.

38:35.966 --> 38:37.600
You're supposed to be
happy in Heaven, right?

38:37.634 --> 38:39.303
But just the thought of that,

38:39.336 --> 38:41.272
that crushed me.

38:41.305 --> 38:43.040
I could never get up

38:44.175 --> 38:46.777
because I was a self-made man.

38:47.812 --> 38:49.847
I didn't need anybody's help.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.015
You know that.

38:53.184 --> 38:55.652
It wasn't until I hit bottom

38:58.655 --> 38:59.990
and I reached out

39:01.691 --> 39:03.894
and I asked for God's help.

39:05.396 --> 39:07.865
And he showed me this place.

39:09.033 --> 39:12.136
And he showed me my
family living here.

39:13.370 --> 39:14.939
It was in a dream.

39:15.873 --> 39:17.241
It was in a dream.

39:17.274 --> 39:20.411
The craziest thing in the
world in a dream and I,

39:20.444 --> 39:23.280
I just held on to that every day

39:23.314 --> 39:25.116
and every night.

39:25.149 --> 39:26.217
Now I'm here.

39:27.218 --> 39:28.953
I followed His word.

39:30.788 --> 39:33.190
It's, it's so funny, I mean,

39:34.758 --> 39:37.027
I always thought you were
the crazy homeless guy.

39:37.061 --> 39:38.728
I was pretty crazy.

39:41.031 --> 39:42.632
But you weren't.

39:44.835 --> 39:46.971
You're the one who's wise.

39:48.005 --> 39:48.939
You saw this place.

39:48.973 --> 39:49.974
You have peace.

39:50.007 --> 39:51.674
I never had that.

39:51.708 --> 39:53.210
I was too busy like everybody
else trying to get it,

39:53.244 --> 39:55.880
trying to make it work,

39:55.913 --> 39:57.214
working, making money,

39:57.248 --> 39:58.949
try to put it all together,

39:58.983 --> 40:01.185
hold it in my own hands.

40:01.218 --> 40:02.887
But you let it all.

40:03.888 --> 40:05.022
You trusted God

40:05.055 --> 40:07.224
cause you saw this place.

40:07.258 --> 40:08.159
You were the wise one.

40:08.192 --> 40:10.327
You have peace, I have had that.

40:10.361 --> 40:13.831
We all have a different road
that God gives us, you know.

40:13.864 --> 40:15.966
Mine was different.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.235
They all lead to one place,

40:18.269 --> 40:19.136
to Him.

40:20.404 --> 40:22.739
You gotta meet my family.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:32.149 --> 40:33.150
Ooh, thanks.

40:34.285 --> 40:36.020
You got anything stronger?

40:36.053 --> 40:37.388
Stronger than root beer?

40:37.421 --> 40:39.056
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

40:39.089 --> 40:42.059
I'm sorry man, I don't drink.

40:42.092 --> 40:43.460
Oh, right.

40:43.494 --> 40:46.263
Because of your religion.

40:46.297 --> 40:47.998
No.

40:48.032 --> 40:50.834
It's just that I
used to drink a lot.

40:50.868 --> 40:51.969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:53.504 --> 40:57.241
But then after I found religion,
as you like to call it,

40:57.274 --> 40:59.810
I just lost the taste for it.

41:02.079 --> 41:03.847
I guess that's a good thing.

41:03.881 --> 41:05.249
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:05.282 --> 41:07.384
You're gonna have a spare
room while you're here.

41:07.418 --> 41:08.852
Oh yeah.

41:08.886 --> 41:10.087
Thanks.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.488
It's not going to be
for long, you know,

41:11.522 --> 41:12.957
it's just until

41:12.990 --> 41:16.927
this all blows over with
Elizabeth and you know.

41:20.864 --> 41:21.765
Talk about eye sores.

41:21.799 --> 41:22.967
It's not that bad.

41:23.000 --> 41:23.934
No, that,

41:24.868 --> 41:26.303
that is really bad.

41:28.405 --> 41:30.174
Well, look, I was
actually wondering

41:30.207 --> 41:33.177
if you might be interested
in buying it off me.

41:33.210 --> 41:34.245
Oh, what, the boulder?

41:34.278 --> 41:35.512
No, no,

41:35.546 --> 41:36.413
the house.

41:37.948 --> 41:39.550
Look, it's just that I
don't need a place this big.

41:39.583 --> 41:41.285
I'm traveling so much these days

41:41.318 --> 41:44.521
and you might want to
be marrying Elizabeth

41:44.555 --> 41:47.191
hopefully sooner than later.

41:47.224 --> 41:49.360
I don't know, this is like
the right kind of place

41:49.393 --> 41:50.527
to have kids, settle down.

41:50.561 --> 41:52.830
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down on that.

41:52.863 --> 41:53.497
Okay.

41:53.530 --> 41:54.531
All right.

41:54.565 --> 41:55.399
Just think about it.

41:55.432 --> 41:56.400
Okay.

41:56.433 --> 41:59.169
I'd make you a great deal.

41:59.203 --> 42:02.273
So, what are you doing again?

42:02.306 --> 42:04.241
Mercy ships.

42:04.275 --> 42:05.409
It's aid work.

42:05.442 --> 42:06.310
I manage medical teams.

42:06.343 --> 42:07.578
Oh yeah.

42:07.611 --> 42:09.079
That's cool.

42:09.113 --> 42:10.114
What are you studying to be?

42:10.147 --> 42:10.981
An EMT?

42:12.116 --> 42:13.050
Yeah.

42:13.083 --> 42:15.352
No, I'm still working on that.

42:15.386 --> 42:17.421
That's great, man.

42:17.454 --> 42:18.455
That's good.

42:19.456 --> 42:20.824
So listen,

42:20.858 --> 42:24.995
I was planning on going
to a small group thing

42:25.029 --> 42:26.163
with the church tonight.

42:26.196 --> 42:27.998
You all want to come?

42:30.334 --> 42:31.902
No, dude.

42:31.935 --> 42:34.305
You know, I'm not into all
that religious stuff, like.

42:34.338 --> 42:36.173
Right, right, right.

42:36.206 --> 42:38.309
Cause you got your
life all together

42:38.342 --> 42:40.811
and everything's going well.

42:42.613 --> 42:43.614
I'm kidding man.

42:43.647 --> 42:44.982
Come on, come on down

42:45.015 --> 42:46.483
and see all the crazy
religious freaks.

42:46.517 --> 42:47.918
That'd be a good time.

42:47.951 --> 42:49.053
Oh my gosh.

42:50.954 --> 42:51.822
Bro, fine.

42:53.023 --> 42:54.491
Hey, there we go.

42:56.460 --> 42:58.595
I mean what else
am I going to do?

42:58.629 --> 43:00.197
Great question.

43:03.067 --> 43:04.168
Oh yeah.

43:04.201 --> 43:07.271
Lots of crazy religious freaks.

43:07.304 --> 43:08.872
We can all make mistakes.

43:08.906 --> 43:11.275
As men, we tend to lead first

43:11.308 --> 43:12.609
and ask questions later.

43:12.643 --> 43:14.378
And sometimes this
can be a good thing.

43:14.411 --> 43:16.413
Sometimes it can be bad.

43:17.915 --> 43:19.083
If we make the wrong decision,

43:19.116 --> 43:21.251
we end up hurting
those around us.

43:21.285 --> 43:24.421
Our wives, friends,
kids, girlfriends,

43:25.522 --> 43:28.258
and then guilt
can weigh us down.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.129
And if we're not careful,

43:32.162 --> 43:34.598
that guilt will lead us right
back to the same decision

43:34.631 --> 43:37.134
that got us there
in the first place.

43:37.167 --> 43:40.371
Now we may choose to
live in that guilt

43:40.404 --> 43:41.271
in a cave,

43:42.606 --> 43:45.909
hidden where we once used
to lead out on the horizon.

43:45.943 --> 43:48.612
As man if left to
our own devices,

43:50.214 --> 43:53.150
we'll stay in that cave for
as long as we possibly can.

43:53.183 --> 43:55.085
Heck we even set
them up in our homes

43:55.119 --> 43:57.121
and call them man caves.

43:59.656 --> 44:02.393
If we choose to
live in those caves,

44:02.426 --> 44:03.293
in guilt,

44:04.495 --> 44:07.264
we're in the darkness, lost.

44:07.297 --> 44:10.134
And as we crawl deeper
and deeper into that cave,

44:10.167 --> 44:13.203
we need a lamp to guide us out.

44:13.237 --> 44:16.306
Jesus says he is a
lamp unto our feet.

44:17.474 --> 44:18.675
We must follow that lamp

44:18.709 --> 44:22.379
to lead us out of guilt
and fear and shame.

44:23.580 --> 44:26.216
Jesus wants us to live lives

44:26.250 --> 44:27.451
that go beyond,

44:27.484 --> 44:29.486
into eternity in heaven.

44:30.721 --> 44:34.525
He wants us to live our
lives to the fullest.

44:35.592 --> 44:36.960
Do children go there,

44:36.994 --> 44:38.295
like to heaven?

44:38.328 --> 44:40.531
I mean like, like little kids,

44:40.564 --> 44:42.032
you know babies.

44:43.634 --> 44:45.169
Yes, of course.

44:47.204 --> 44:51.575
Do you mean when a child
dies in a miscarriage?

44:51.608 --> 44:53.343
No, the other one.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.447
Yes, Jonathan.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.716
That is the beauty of
eternity with Christ.

44:59.750 --> 45:04.021
That when you die, you
live forever in heaven.

45:04.054 --> 45:04.756
In paradise.

45:12.529 --> 45:14.998
Hey, I just need to
get some air real quick.

45:37.789 --> 45:39.523
Hey, what's wrong?

45:43.560 --> 45:45.496
I made a mistake and,

45:46.630 --> 45:47.698
look, I tried to stop it,

45:47.731 --> 45:49.333
but it was my fault

45:49.366 --> 45:50.701
and I, look I, I.

45:53.504 --> 45:55.239
Hey, it's okay.

45:55.272 --> 45:56.139
It's okay.

45:57.775 --> 46:01.745
This is what forgiveness
is all about.

46:01.779 --> 46:04.214
You can start over again.

46:04.248 --> 46:05.649
Yeah?

46:05.682 --> 46:07.584
That's what I did.

46:07.618 --> 46:09.119
So can you.

46:09.152 --> 46:10.654
Man, after she left me,

46:10.687 --> 46:13.758
she didn't just go to her
parents' house for awhile.

46:13.791 --> 46:15.559
She left me for good.

46:19.730 --> 46:21.298
I broke her heart

46:22.432 --> 46:24.701
and I made her do
that horrible thing.

46:24.735 --> 46:28.205
And I can't forgive
myself for that.

46:28.238 --> 46:29.239
It's okay.

46:30.474 --> 46:32.075
It's not over yet.

46:34.344 --> 46:35.212
Yeah.

46:36.580 --> 46:38.181
It's not over yet.

46:41.318 --> 46:42.185
Yeah.

46:43.520 --> 46:44.388
Yeah.

46:51.261 --> 46:52.729
God, if you're real

46:54.698 --> 46:57.467
and you are who
they say you are,

47:00.137 --> 47:04.541
then I'm praying now that
you give me a second chance.

47:05.810 --> 47:06.677
Please.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.464
I'm sorry.

47:27.497 --> 47:32.135
I was wrong and I never
should've pushed you into it.

47:32.169 --> 47:32.804
It's too late.

47:32.837 --> 47:34.438
No, no it's not.

47:36.440 --> 47:37.541
If you're talking about us,

47:37.574 --> 47:39.643
then yeah, it's too late.

47:40.544 --> 47:42.880
I was talking about Rachel.

48:01.498 --> 48:03.233
See, I thought it was too
late too, but it's not true.

48:03.266 --> 48:04.668
It's not too late.

48:11.408 --> 48:12.877
Because I believe

48:12.910 --> 48:15.178
that we will see her again

48:15.947 --> 48:16.814
in Heaven.

48:20.517 --> 48:22.619
But you don't
believe in Heaven

48:22.653 --> 48:24.521
No, I do, I do now.

48:24.554 --> 48:27.925
And I know that you
have for so long

48:27.959 --> 48:31.328
and I'm sorry that
I never did, but

48:31.361 --> 48:32.229
tonight I

48:33.831 --> 48:38.301
am a crazy religious person,
just like my brother.

48:38.335 --> 48:39.202
Really?

48:40.004 --> 48:41.204
I'm sorry.

48:52.582 --> 48:53.851
I forgive you.

48:55.452 --> 48:58.255
I can't wait to
see Rachel again.

48:59.924 --> 49:01.324
Yeah, me too.

49:07.932 --> 49:10.534
Hey wait, where are you going?

49:11.936 --> 49:14.471
I'm staying with my parents.

49:16.473 --> 49:19.309
Since you, we are
Christians now,

49:20.477 --> 49:22.746
we can't be living together.

49:24.281 --> 49:26.283
Not until we're married.

49:28.685 --> 49:30.320
You sure about that?

49:30.353 --> 49:30.988
Don't.

49:31.022 --> 49:31.889
Okay.

49:31.923 --> 49:33.490
Okay, all right.

49:35.392 --> 49:36.259
So,

49:38.029 --> 49:39.629
when you're ready,

49:40.898 --> 49:41.766
come back.

49:52.043 --> 49:53.343
Okay, then.

49:54.979 --> 49:56.313
Let's do this.

50:11.763 --> 50:13.363
You need to go down there.

50:13.396 --> 50:16.433
There's someone that
wants to meet you.

51:10.420 --> 51:11.555
Welcome home, Daddy.

51:11.588 --> 51:12.455
Rachel.

51:13.423 --> 51:14.324
My daughter.

51:19.030 --> 51:20.430
I've been waiting
for you and this moment

51:20.463 --> 51:22.499
for a long time.

51:22.532 --> 51:23.835
Time to come out of the dark.

51:23.868 --> 51:26.369
I have someone else
I want you to meet.

51:26.403 --> 51:27.872
Let's keep going, Daddy.

51:27.905 --> 51:29.040
Death is no more.

51:29.073 --> 51:30.808
Daddy, it's no more.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.035
Hi Jonathan.

52:05.810 --> 52:06.643
Hey.

52:19.991 --> 52:21.125
How are you?

52:28.132 --> 52:30.600
Actually, I feel terrible.

52:35.940 --> 52:37.808
I really miss my hair.

52:41.578 --> 52:43.513
I miss feeling healthy.

52:45.649 --> 52:48.085
And I just miss being with you.

52:50.553 --> 52:51.521
With me?

52:51.554 --> 52:52.522
Yeah.

52:52.555 --> 52:54.524
How crazy is that?

53:06.703 --> 53:07.939
Hey Jonathan.

53:07.972 --> 53:08.806
Yeah?

53:10.207 --> 53:11.708
I was thinking.

53:13.244 --> 53:14.577
Do you remember

53:15.846 --> 53:17.647
before we got married

53:18.816 --> 53:20.151
what you told me?

53:23.087 --> 53:27.457
You said that one day we
will see our Rachel again.

53:30.261 --> 53:31.996
Remember, in Heaven?

53:44.741 --> 53:46.777
I want you to know

53:46.811 --> 53:49.746
even though I feel
really terrible,

53:52.649 --> 53:57.554
I just feel, I just feel
like this peace around me.

53:57.587 --> 53:58.688
I can't explain it.

53:58.722 --> 53:59.589
It's like,

54:01.624 --> 54:03.094
it's like a warmth.

54:04.627 --> 54:06.596
It's just all over my body.

54:06.629 --> 54:07.497
Like I,

54:09.100 --> 54:11.102
I can just feel God.

54:11.135 --> 54:12.702
I can feel His presence.

54:12.736 --> 54:14.772
I know it's gonna be okay.

54:15.806 --> 54:18.009
I know He's got this.

54:22.645 --> 54:23.513
Jonathan,

54:27.885 --> 54:31.088
even though I'm going
away for a while,

54:35.026 --> 54:38.595
we're also gonna
see each other again

54:38.628 --> 54:39.629
really soon.

54:51.976 --> 54:53.110
This next part

54:54.912 --> 54:56.113
of the journey,

54:58.681 --> 55:00.117
that's the good part.

55:11.661 --> 55:14.065
There's no more pain.

55:14.098 --> 55:15.933
There's no more tears,

55:17.734 --> 55:19.602
and no more suffering,

55:20.838 --> 55:22.039
no more sorrow,

55:25.642 --> 55:26.977
no more sickness,

55:29.246 --> 55:30.580
no more death,

55:32.383 --> 55:34.151
no more evil,

55:34.185 --> 55:35.652
no more sadness.

55:38.389 --> 55:41.591
All of our tears
will be wiped away.

55:42.692 --> 55:44.862
The old things are no more.

55:47.064 --> 55:48.999
The day has dawned.

56:03.447 --> 56:04.882
Come on daddy, hurry up.

56:39.783 --> 56:40.717
Jonathan.

56:44.054 --> 56:47.424
I was remembering when
I married you two,

56:47.458 --> 56:49.293
you basically eloped.

56:50.928 --> 56:52.263
I was so nervous.

56:53.397 --> 56:56.934
It was my first
marriage ceremony, but

56:56.967 --> 56:59.236
I knew then she was special.

57:02.006 --> 57:03.207
I know I can't do much to help.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.108
And

57:05.809 --> 57:09.313
I know Elizabeth is
still your whole world.

57:10.447 --> 57:12.316
And I know that right
now you must feel

57:12.349 --> 57:15.718
like you cannot carry
home without her.

57:18.822 --> 57:23.027
Heaven is God's answered
from the broken hearted.

57:23.060 --> 57:24.929
There's always hope.

57:24.962 --> 57:26.363
It's not over yet.

57:41.278 --> 57:44.048
So sorry, I was in
the middle of Africa

57:44.081 --> 57:45.950
and I tried to get her
as fast as I could.

57:45.983 --> 57:47.785
I, I just couldn't.

57:47.818 --> 57:49.887
There was no flights.

57:49.920 --> 57:50.921
It's okay.

57:52.323 --> 57:53.924
You're my brother.

57:55.059 --> 57:58.262
You'll walk through
fire to get to me, so.

57:59.430 --> 58:00.464
It's okay.

58:00.497 --> 58:01.365
John, I,

58:03.867 --> 58:05.002
I am so sorry.

58:09.540 --> 58:11.008
Liz was amazing.

58:21.151 --> 58:22.519
Jonathan,

58:22.553 --> 58:25.756
how are you coping
with all of this?

58:30.894 --> 58:32.196
I'm okay.

58:32.229 --> 58:34.265
I know that's what we say,

58:34.298 --> 58:36.066
but that's not
always how we feel.

58:36.100 --> 58:38.369
I mean, how are you doing?

58:38.402 --> 58:42.206
People don't really
care about how I feel.

58:42.239 --> 58:45.242
No one really cares about that.

58:45.276 --> 58:46.210
It's like in my job,

58:46.243 --> 58:49.880
people just want to be
told that it's okay.

58:49.913 --> 58:51.315
Everything's okay.

58:53.450 --> 58:54.551
I don't know.

58:58.422 --> 58:59.356
Jonathan,

59:00.391 --> 59:01.925
say how you feel.

59:03.227 --> 59:06.263
If you won't say it to
me, then say it to God.

59:06.297 --> 59:08.265
Tell Him how you feel.

59:14.204 --> 59:15.806
It is okay to hurt.

59:19.209 --> 59:21.345
It's okay to grieve, okay.

59:25.316 --> 59:27.151
That's more than okay.

59:27.184 --> 59:29.353
That's what makes us human.

59:30.287 --> 59:31.455
We're not machines.

59:31.488 --> 59:33.957
We're flesh and we're blood.

59:35.592 --> 59:38.195
When we lose someone, we hurt.

59:41.231 --> 59:44.101
Sometimes that
hurt can take years

59:46.603 --> 59:47.471
and

59:50.507 --> 59:52.843
sometimes they never heal.

59:56.146 --> 59:57.981
It's with us forever.

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:10.427
I can stay here if that
will help, if you like.

01:00:12.396 --> 01:00:13.263
I just,

01:00:14.565 --> 01:00:18.168
please just tell me
what you need from me.

01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:22.272
I just,

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:28.145
I just want to be left alone.

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:31.982
That's all.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.317
I want you gone!

01:01:08.685 --> 01:01:09.686
I

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.687
want

01:01:10.721 --> 01:01:11.688
you

01:01:11.722 --> 01:01:13.023
gone!

01:01:13.056 --> 01:01:15.025
Why won't you move?

01:01:22.132 --> 01:01:23.000
Why?

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:47.090
Here, daddy.

01:02:00.671 --> 01:02:03.740
You see the track
marks on her arm?

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:06.677
Come on.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.278
Stay with us, stay with us.

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:09.513
Not today.

01:02:09.546 --> 01:02:10.414
One,

01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:11.281
two,

01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:12.249
three,

01:02:12.282 --> 01:02:13.250
four,

01:02:13.283 --> 01:02:14.117
five.

01:02:15.719 --> 01:02:17.087
Come on now.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.388
Don't die on me.

01:02:22.059 --> 01:02:23.494
Come on.

01:02:23.527 --> 01:02:25.496
- All right.
- No pulse.

01:02:25.529 --> 01:02:26.530
All right.

01:02:26.563 --> 01:02:27.431
Clear.

01:02:30.234 --> 01:02:31.635
No pulse.

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:33.136
One more time.

01:02:34.204 --> 01:02:35.038
Clear.

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.642
Oh, come on, come on.

01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:40.210
Still no pulse.

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:44.381
All right, give
it one more shot.

01:02:44.414 --> 01:02:46.216
One more time.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:47.117
Clear.

01:02:55.292 --> 01:02:56.693
Call it.

01:02:59.363 --> 01:03:00.230
3:45.

01:03:04.635 --> 01:03:07.304
I guess it was only
a matter of time.

01:03:20.852 --> 01:03:24.655
Mrs. Jones,
are you sleeping again?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.235
Her feet.

01:03:38.268 --> 01:03:40.737
You never checked her feet.

01:03:40.772 --> 01:03:43.206
Sir, is there someone
we can call for you?

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.107
No.

01:03:54.351 --> 01:03:55.319
Can you
check on my wife?

01:03:55.352 --> 01:03:57.087
We just got married.

01:04:02.794 --> 01:04:04.361
I got a pulse.

01:04:04.394 --> 01:04:06.363
Okay, okay, she's
gonna be okay.

01:04:06.396 --> 01:04:07.464
- Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:04:07.497 --> 01:04:08.532
It's all right.

01:04:08.565 --> 01:04:09.633
There you go.

01:04:14.237 --> 01:04:15.138
Hey.

01:04:15.172 --> 01:04:16.139
What's up man?

01:04:16.173 --> 01:04:17.140
Hey.

01:04:17.174 --> 01:04:17.875
Good for you.

01:04:17.909 --> 01:04:18.675
You got that water thing going.

01:04:18.709 --> 01:04:19.576
It's about time.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:20.477
Yeah.

01:04:22.713 --> 01:04:24.581
You look happy.

01:04:24.615 --> 01:04:27.618
Nah, man, it's
just my usual face.

01:04:27.651 --> 01:04:30.755
Did you go on that date yet?

01:04:30.788 --> 01:04:32.556
What date?

01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:33.858
You know, with Francesca?

01:04:33.891 --> 01:04:34.892
Did you go on that date?

01:04:34.926 --> 01:04:36.226
Yeah, we went on a date.

01:04:37.661 --> 01:04:40.197
Actually, it's been three dates.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.565
- Three?
- And a fourth

01:04:41.598 --> 01:04:42.432
tomorrow.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:43.400
Whoa.

01:04:43.433 --> 01:04:45.502
When did all this happen?

01:04:46.603 --> 01:04:48.538
Yeah, I mean, I know I,

01:04:49.506 --> 01:04:51.541
I haven't been around.

01:04:51.575 --> 01:04:52.442
Yeah.

01:04:53.377 --> 01:04:54.678
It's wow.

01:04:54.711 --> 01:04:58.348
Look, I didn't want
to bring it up, man.

01:04:58.382 --> 01:04:59.416
I don't know.

01:04:59.449 --> 01:05:00.717
Oh no, no, no.

01:05:00.751 --> 01:05:02.319
It's, it's great.

01:05:02.352 --> 01:05:04.254
It's, it's really good to
hear good news for a change.

01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:06.256
So you know, it's awesome.

01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:07.591
- Thanks.
- Really happy for you.

01:05:07.624 --> 01:05:10.560
Well if you think
that's good news,

01:05:10.594 --> 01:05:13.463
then you would be
interested in this.

01:05:13.497 --> 01:05:14.364
Bam!

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:16.333
Oh.

01:05:17.334 --> 01:05:18.368
Way to go, Chuck.

01:05:18.402 --> 01:05:20.270
And only after a few dates.

01:05:20.303 --> 01:05:21.271
That, that's impressive.

01:05:21.304 --> 01:05:22.339
That's...

01:05:22.372 --> 01:05:23.407
- Hey.
- That's awesome.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.777
- It's not over yet.
- Yeah.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.577
That's what you told me.

01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:28.478
I did?

01:05:29.446 --> 01:05:30.580
Look, man.

01:05:30.614 --> 01:05:32.817
When you first
started working here,

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:36.620
I had just had that horrible
break up with Doreen.

01:05:36.653 --> 01:05:39.423
Yeah, you were in
pretty bad shape.

01:05:39.456 --> 01:05:41.224
You got that right.

01:05:41.258 --> 01:05:44.594
But then you told me I
would meet somebody else

01:05:44.628 --> 01:05:46.964
and I said it's
never gonna happen.

01:05:46.998 --> 01:05:49.700
It's never gonna happen, man.

01:05:49.733 --> 01:05:51.601
I couldn't believe it.

01:05:54.571 --> 01:05:55.973
But then you said.

01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:58.843
It's not over yet.

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:00.277
That's right.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.481
It's not over yet.

01:06:07.852 --> 01:06:08.853
I hope so.

01:06:14.058 --> 01:06:14.892
Me too.

01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:43.653
Jonathan.

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:46.623
It's okay.

01:06:46.656 --> 01:06:47.624
It's okay.

01:06:47.657 --> 01:06:49.827
Everything's okay.

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:08.039
Stop the car.

01:08:08.072 --> 01:08:08.906
What?

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:09.774
Stop, stop, stop.

01:08:09.807 --> 01:08:10.975
There's, look.

01:08:11.008 --> 01:08:12.609
Look, look.

01:08:12.642 --> 01:08:14.511
There's a bench.

01:08:14.544 --> 01:08:15.378
Oh.

01:08:17.747 --> 01:08:19.349
Look at the bench.

01:08:20.417 --> 01:08:21.751
Oh, it's perfect.

01:08:23.087 --> 01:08:23.921
Great.

01:08:23.955 --> 01:08:25.022
Clean it up, and,

01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:25.923
oh yeah.

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:28.993
Oh, I love it.

01:08:32.495 --> 01:08:33.930
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:08:33.965 --> 01:08:35.099
It's probably
full of termites.

01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:36.466
No, no.

01:08:36.499 --> 01:08:37.500
We can like clean
it up or something.

01:08:37.533 --> 01:08:38.401
It's fine.

01:08:39.136 --> 01:08:40.604
Oh, it's so good.

01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:42.073
Why don't you
just get a new one?

01:08:42.106 --> 01:08:43.140
- It's just like...
- It's not the same.

01:08:43.174 --> 01:08:44.573
It's not the same.

01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:46.509
It's just like a
Home Depot bench.

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:47.510
They're really cheap.

01:08:47.544 --> 01:08:48.678
I know, I know.

01:08:48.712 --> 01:08:49.814
Well, I'm just
letting you know

01:08:49.846 --> 01:08:50.948
in case you think
you're going to do it up

01:08:50.982 --> 01:08:52.149
and sell for a million dollars.

01:08:52.183 --> 01:08:53.483
Cause it's not going to happen.

01:08:53.515 --> 01:08:54.684
It's not worth anything.

01:08:54.718 --> 01:08:55.719
I know.

01:08:55.752 --> 01:08:56.620
It's okay.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.122
Come on, it's great.

01:08:59.156 --> 01:09:00.191
Please,

01:09:00.224 --> 01:09:02.392
please, please, please.

01:09:03.127 --> 01:09:04.594
Okay, okay.

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:06.696
More junk for the house.

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:07.663
All right.

01:09:07.697 --> 01:09:09.566
It's not junk.

01:09:09.599 --> 01:09:10.433
Man.

01:09:10.466 --> 01:09:11.600
Can you?

01:09:11.635 --> 01:09:12.169
- It's gross.
- Just be careful.

01:09:12.203 --> 01:09:13.770
Don't scratch.

01:09:13.804 --> 01:09:15.139
Okay, okay.

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:16.706
All right, here we go.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:17.774
Okay, all right.

01:09:17.808 --> 01:09:19.475
Right there, that's good.

01:09:19.509 --> 01:09:20.176
Watch it.

01:09:20.211 --> 01:09:21.578
Watch it.

01:09:21.611 --> 01:09:22.479
You know, it's not
really helping me,

01:09:22.511 --> 01:09:23.680
what you're doing.

01:09:23.712 --> 01:09:24.849
- Doesn't really help at all.
- Stop.

01:09:24.881 --> 01:09:27.484
- But I appreciate it.
- This is great.

01:09:27.517 --> 01:09:28.752
It might make you feel better.

01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:29.787
Just,

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:30.787
all right lift it,

01:09:30.821 --> 01:09:31.788
higher, higher.

01:09:31.822 --> 01:09:32.823
Oh, careful.

01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:34.825
Jonathan.

01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:35.786
Yes.

01:10:37.054 --> 01:10:38.655
Yes, right there.

01:10:38.688 --> 01:10:39.857
That's exactly it.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.258
Thank you for your help.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:42.193
- Yes.
- Excuse me.

01:10:42.226 --> 01:10:43.593
You're welcome, honey.

01:10:43.626 --> 01:10:44.895
This is good.

01:10:44.929 --> 01:10:45.863
This is good.

01:10:45.896 --> 01:10:47.865
Okay, that way, that way.

01:10:49.967 --> 01:10:50.935
I love it.

01:10:50.968 --> 01:10:51.836
I love it.

01:10:51.869 --> 01:10:53.070
It's so good.

01:10:53.104 --> 01:10:54.071
It's like Betsy.

01:10:54.105 --> 01:10:55.172
Yeah.

01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:57.775
Just as old and ugly is Betsy.

01:10:59.609 --> 01:11:00.244
It true.

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:08.752
Do you remember
when we first met?

01:11:09.652 --> 01:11:11.055
Yeah.

01:11:25.735 --> 01:11:29.774
Do you
remember our first date?

01:11:29.807 --> 01:11:31.008
Yeah.

01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:32.309
It was the park.

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:35.146
Yeah, a park.

01:11:35.179 --> 01:11:36.213
It had that tree,

01:11:36.247 --> 01:11:38.648
a river running through it.

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:46.090
Oh, and the bench, yeah.

01:11:46.123 --> 01:11:47.124
The bench.

01:11:52.163 --> 01:11:55.299
And we just talk
about our future, and

01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:59.270
how many children we'd have,

01:11:59.303 --> 01:12:01.738
what kind of house we'd own.

01:12:03.774 --> 01:12:04.607
I told you

01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:07.144
I wanted to have a house

01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:10.580
on a river with a
bench just like this.

01:12:12.116 --> 01:12:14.085
We could just sit on it.

01:12:15.886 --> 01:12:17.755
And grow old together.

01:12:20.091 --> 01:12:20.958
Remember?

01:12:50.020 --> 01:12:51.755
Well, that worked.

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:00.697
It's,

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:04.034
this feels so...

01:13:06.103 --> 01:13:07.071
Real?

01:13:07.104 --> 01:13:07.938
Yeah.

01:13:09.406 --> 01:13:11.842
It's like I I was in a dream

01:13:13.244 --> 01:13:15.379
but now I've woken up.

01:13:15.412 --> 01:13:16.280
Yeah.

01:13:17.448 --> 01:13:18.415
This is it.

01:13:18.449 --> 01:13:19.817
This is it, Jonathan.

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:22.786
This is the house I
always dreamed of.

01:13:23.787 --> 01:13:25.289
I should've listened to you.

01:13:25.322 --> 01:13:26.190
I know.

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:29.894
It's okay, it's okay.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:30.761
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:13:30.794 --> 01:13:31.929
That's in the past.

01:13:31.962 --> 01:13:33.063
I'm sorry.

01:13:33.097 --> 01:13:34.098
I just,

01:13:34.131 --> 01:13:36.767
I spent our whole marriage

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.269
working, trying to

01:13:38.302 --> 01:13:42.006
get enough money to buy
you your dream house.

01:13:42.039 --> 01:13:43.407
And in the process,

01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.911
we never got to spend
any time together.

01:13:48.379 --> 01:13:50.481
I wasted all that time.

01:13:50.514 --> 01:13:51.382
I'm sorry.

01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:56.954
I guess God had a better plan,

01:13:56.987 --> 01:13:59.223
just not the one I thought.

01:14:00.791 --> 01:14:02.993
It doesn't even
matter anymore.

01:14:03.027 --> 01:14:05.095
There's something
that's been puzzling me

01:14:05.129 --> 01:14:06.230
since I've been here.

01:14:06.263 --> 01:14:09.233
What's that?

01:14:09.266 --> 01:14:11.101
How did I get here?

01:14:12.236 --> 01:14:14.737
Jonathan, you'll know soon.

01:14:18.242 --> 01:14:19.109
Okay.

01:14:52.142 --> 01:14:55.546
Everybody, what
are you doing here?

01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:58.249
Hey, I got you some help.

01:14:58.282 --> 01:14:59.250
Yeah?

01:14:59.283 --> 01:15:00.784
What for?

01:15:00.818 --> 01:15:02.519
We just want to help
you move that bolder.

01:15:02.553 --> 01:15:05.856
I mean, you keep going on
about how annoying it is.

01:15:05.889 --> 01:15:07.424
So I don't know, man.

01:15:07.458 --> 01:15:09.126
We just want to
help, that's all.

01:15:09.159 --> 01:15:10.861
Yeah, but

01:15:10.894 --> 01:15:12.263
don't worry about it.

01:15:12.296 --> 01:15:14.131
I'm probably just going
to sell the house with it.

01:15:14.164 --> 01:15:14.999
It's fine.

01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:15.866
What?

01:15:16.834 --> 01:15:18.002
With that thing?

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:19.436
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:22.206
Look, I'm not a
real estate expert,

01:15:22.239 --> 01:15:24.308
but I'm sure if we got
rid of that eyesore,

01:15:24.341 --> 01:15:27.077
then you'll probably
get a lot more for it.

01:15:27.111 --> 01:15:28.479
Yeah, I don't know.

01:15:28.512 --> 01:15:30.981
I mean, I've been trying to
move that thing for years.

01:15:31.015 --> 01:15:32.916
It's just not going to budge.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:33.884
So don't worry about it.

01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:36.487
Hey, it's not over yet.

01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:40.557
Yeah.

01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:43.360
Beginning to regret I ever
told you that expression.

01:15:45.562 --> 01:15:46.897
No way.

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:49.533
It's my favorite
catchphrase, man,

01:15:50.534 --> 01:15:52.970
and my fiance's as well.

01:15:53.003 --> 01:15:53.971
Wow.

01:15:54.004 --> 01:15:54.972
That's awesome, man.

01:15:55.005 --> 01:15:55.973
Congratulations.

01:15:56.006 --> 01:15:56.974
That's really great.

01:15:57.007 --> 01:15:58.142
- That's awesome.
- Thanks, man.

01:15:58.175 --> 01:15:59.476
And Pastor Steve
is going to marry us.

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.911
Oh, that's great.

01:16:00.944 --> 01:16:01.979
Awesome.

01:16:02.012 --> 01:16:04.181
And well, I was wondering

01:16:04.214 --> 01:16:07.051
if we could have
the ceremony here

01:16:07.084 --> 01:16:08.585
because I live in an apartment

01:16:08.619 --> 01:16:10.354
and so does she.

01:16:10.387 --> 01:16:11.255
Here?

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:13.590
Really?

01:16:13.624 --> 01:16:16.960
I mean, once the
boulder's out, of course.

01:16:18.362 --> 01:16:19.229
Well,

01:16:20.464 --> 01:16:21.332
okay then,

01:16:22.466 --> 01:16:24.068
I guess you're right.

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:25.202
It's not over yet.

01:16:27.571 --> 01:16:29.073
- Let's do it.
- Let's get to it.

01:16:29.106 --> 01:16:30.908
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:16:30.941 --> 01:16:32.376
Let's do it, fellas.

01:17:13.417 --> 01:17:15.652
It's a stubborn old thing.

01:17:16.587 --> 01:17:17.454
Wow.

01:17:20.023 --> 01:17:22.126
I got an idea.

01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.560
Where you going?

01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:36.540
Oh man, I
hate this piece of junk.

01:17:36.573 --> 01:17:38.442
Hey, now, hey, stop.

01:17:39.443 --> 01:17:42.012
Don't be hating on old Betsy.

01:17:43.313 --> 01:17:44.615
Betsy.

01:17:44.648 --> 01:17:45.616
Yeah, Betsy.

01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:46.617
That's her name.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:48.318
Don't you remember?

01:17:50.187 --> 01:17:52.556
Since when did Betsy
become the official name

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:53.557
of this old truck?

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:55.058
It's official.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.030
Pop's had her as long
as I can remember,

01:18:02.232 --> 01:18:04.234
until he gave her to us.

01:18:05.436 --> 01:18:07.638
And here, yep, there it is.

01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:11.508
She's got her trusty roadmap.

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:26.190
See, there you go.

01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:28.358
She's a reliable old broad.

01:18:28.392 --> 01:18:30.060
Betsy.

01:18:30.093 --> 01:18:30.727
What?

01:18:30.762 --> 01:18:31.695
Don't say it.

01:18:31.728 --> 01:18:34.097
- I wasn't...
- Don't say it.

01:18:35.767 --> 01:18:39.102
I wasn't going to
say just like you.

01:18:54.117 --> 01:18:55.252
You guys ready?

01:18:55.285 --> 01:18:56.320
Let's do it.

01:19:01.225 --> 01:19:02.659
Wait, wait, stop.

01:19:04.461 --> 01:19:06.196
We forgot something.

01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:09.500
We need to pray this thing away.

01:19:09.533 --> 01:19:10.367
Jonathan.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.336
Yeah?

01:19:12.369 --> 01:19:13.237
I don't,

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.175
I don't want you

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:20.077
to do this life alone.

01:19:25.215 --> 01:19:26.283
Okay?

01:19:26.316 --> 01:19:27.184
I

01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:31.188
just don't want you to go.

01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:33.156
I don't want you to go.

01:19:37.762 --> 01:19:39.062
Don't worry.

01:19:39.096 --> 01:19:41.565
Listen, you're
going to see again.

01:19:41.598 --> 01:19:42.466
Okay?

01:19:46.403 --> 01:19:48.105
You gotta let go.

01:19:48.138 --> 01:19:50.574
And you gotta let God in.

01:19:58.115 --> 01:19:59.817
Don't forget that.

01:19:59.851 --> 01:20:01.385
You gotta Him in.

01:20:02.519 --> 01:20:05.589
It's too hard to do
on your own, okay.

01:20:07.391 --> 01:20:08.258
Okay.

01:20:12.897 --> 01:20:13.765
Let go.

01:20:15.833 --> 01:20:17.100
Let go, okay.

01:20:23.473 --> 01:20:24.474
Okay, God,

01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:28.178
it's your turn now.

01:22:01.973 --> 01:22:03.407
Jonathan, stop.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.643
I think you're going
to blow the engine.

01:22:06.677 --> 01:22:08.311
You're gonna blow the engine.

01:22:08.345 --> 01:22:09.746
I got this.

01:22:09.781 --> 01:22:11.816
You remember when I was
just about to get married.

01:22:11.849 --> 01:22:13.851
You pulled me
aside and you said,

01:22:13.885 --> 01:22:16.553
with faith, you
can move mountains.

01:22:16.586 --> 01:22:17.521
What?

01:22:17.554 --> 01:22:19.423
Well this is a mountain.

01:22:19.456 --> 01:22:20.825
We can move this.

01:22:20.858 --> 01:22:21.725
Well.

01:22:31.869 --> 01:22:32.870
Keep going.

01:22:32.904 --> 01:22:34.237
What?

01:22:34.271 --> 01:22:35.338
Keep going.

01:22:36.941 --> 01:22:37.875
Hey, hey.

01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:39.877
It's moving.

01:22:40.845 --> 01:22:42.312
It's moving.

01:22:51.555 --> 01:22:53.290
It's not over yet.

01:23:05.302 --> 01:23:06.737
Okay.

01:23:06.771 --> 01:23:08.505
Now we can get going.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.608
What?

01:23:11.641 --> 01:23:12.509
Get going.

01:23:13.911 --> 01:23:15.746
Didn't you tell him?

01:23:17.014 --> 01:23:17.882
Oh yeah.

01:23:19.016 --> 01:23:21.451
I haven't been clear
about the date.

01:23:21.485 --> 01:23:22.552
Date?

01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:24.055
Yeah.

01:23:24.088 --> 01:23:25.923
The wedding is today.

01:23:27.691 --> 01:23:28.658
Ah, okay.

01:23:31.695 --> 01:23:33.663
It's a surprise wedding.

01:23:33.697 --> 01:23:36.333
She thinks he's coming
to meet my folks,

01:23:36.366 --> 01:23:37.769
but,

01:23:37.802 --> 01:23:39.904
well, she's got to meet them

01:23:39.937 --> 01:23:43.507
and then we're going
to go get married.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.374
Okay.

01:23:44.407 --> 01:23:45.642
But I,

01:23:45.675 --> 01:23:46.944
I don't have anything.

01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:48.645
Oh, don't worry.

01:23:48.678 --> 01:23:49.814
We have the catering

01:23:49.847 --> 01:23:51.816
and seating, et cetera
coming from church.

01:23:51.849 --> 01:23:53.350
It's all taken care of.

01:23:53.383 --> 01:23:55.352
And we'll clean it up.

01:23:55.385 --> 01:23:56.854
Okay.

01:23:56.888 --> 01:23:57.721
All right.

01:23:57.754 --> 01:23:58.622
Okay.

01:23:58.655 --> 01:24:00.057
Let's, let's do it then.

01:24:00.091 --> 01:24:01.291
Let's do it.

01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:18.976
Jonathan?

01:24:19.944 --> 01:24:21.678
What are you doing?

01:24:21.711 --> 01:24:22.712
Elizabeth,

01:24:27.118 --> 01:24:29.053
will you marry me?

01:24:35.092 --> 01:24:36.526
Jonathan?

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.995
What are you doing?

01:24:41.799 --> 01:24:42.800
Oh, I see.

01:24:45.002 --> 01:24:47.972
Maybe we should drive
around the block, hun.

01:24:48.005 --> 01:24:49.106
Okay.

01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:49.974
Yeah, okay.

01:24:50.007 --> 01:24:50.842
Okay.

01:24:50.875 --> 01:24:52.576
Oh my gosh.

01:24:57.048 --> 01:24:58.049
Sorry.

01:24:58.082 --> 01:24:59.516
I was kind of choking.

01:24:59.549 --> 01:25:00.584
Are you okay?

01:25:00.617 --> 01:25:01.919
I'm fine.

01:25:01.953 --> 01:25:03.087
Were my parents just here?

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:03.955
Oh.

01:25:03.988 --> 01:25:05.589
Yeah.

01:25:05.622 --> 01:25:07.591
They're just going to drive
around the block for awhile.

01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:09.126
Why?

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:10.828
Well.

01:25:10.862 --> 01:25:13.496
Oh, I haven't
answered you yet?

01:25:13.530 --> 01:25:14.631
No.

01:25:14.664 --> 01:25:15.498
Yes.

01:25:15.532 --> 01:25:16.901
Yes.

01:25:16.934 --> 01:25:18.401
Oh, my leg's asleep.

01:25:18.435 --> 01:25:19.837
- No.
- Come here.

01:25:21.038 --> 01:25:23.406
How are you feeling?

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.509
Man, I don't know
if I can do this.

01:25:27.812 --> 01:25:30.982
With faith the size
of a mustard seed,

01:25:31.015 --> 01:25:33.184
you can move mountains.

01:25:35.887 --> 01:25:37.487
Am I good?

01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:38.655
You look great, brother.

01:25:38.688 --> 01:25:40.024
I've known you
two for a while now.

01:25:40.057 --> 01:25:42.894
So I knew this was
only a matter of time.

01:25:42.927 --> 01:25:44.862
When something is God's will,

01:25:44.896 --> 01:25:47.999
the only thing standing
in the way is us.

01:25:48.032 --> 01:25:51.135
When we let go and we
let God take the reins,

01:25:51.168 --> 01:25:54.005
everything goes much smoother.

01:25:54.038 --> 01:25:58.910
So while all of this seems to
be happening rather quickly,

01:25:58.943 --> 01:26:01.645
it's been destined
from the beginning.

01:26:01.678 --> 01:26:03.713
Today it is my pleasure

01:26:03.747 --> 01:26:05.749
to bring you two
together under God,

01:26:05.783 --> 01:26:07.985
as husband and wife.

01:26:08.019 --> 01:26:09.954
You may kiss the bride.

01:26:42.219 --> 01:26:44.055
It's amazing.

01:26:44.088 --> 01:26:45.823
Is all food this good?

01:26:45.856 --> 01:26:46.958
I mean it's incredible.

01:26:46.991 --> 01:26:47.925
Yeah.

01:26:47.959 --> 01:26:48.759
Everything's amazing here.

01:26:48.793 --> 01:26:49.592
I mean it's Heaven.

01:26:49.626 --> 01:26:50.694
Well yeah.

01:26:51.594 --> 01:26:53.030
And that's not it.

01:26:53.064 --> 01:26:54.865
It's not just about pie, honey.

01:26:54.899 --> 01:26:56.599
There's so much more to see.

01:26:56.633 --> 01:26:58.903
I mean you could spend
a thousand years here

01:26:58.936 --> 01:27:01.839
and there's always something
new to experience and see

01:27:01.872 --> 01:27:05.076
and smell and it never gets old.

01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:07.544
You never get used to it.

01:27:07.577 --> 01:27:08.578
Oh, sorry.

01:27:15.685 --> 01:27:17.121
That's okay, honey.

01:27:17.154 --> 01:27:18.688
Actually, that's the best part.

01:27:18.722 --> 01:27:21.258
You can eat as much as you want.

01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.028
Whoa.

01:27:25.863 --> 01:27:26.730
Wow.

01:27:28.766 --> 01:27:29.699
I guess that's Heaven, isn't it.

01:27:40.244 --> 01:27:42.980
Have I got something on my face?

01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:45.249
No.

01:27:45.282 --> 01:27:46.150
It's just,

01:27:47.284 --> 01:27:50.021
this next part is so special.

01:27:50.054 --> 01:27:51.288
Well it's already
been pretty special.

01:27:51.322 --> 01:27:52.289
No, I know.

01:27:52.323 --> 01:27:54.025
I know, but,

01:27:54.058 --> 01:27:54.925
but this,

01:27:56.127 --> 01:27:58.561
this is why we're here.

01:28:04.734 --> 01:28:05.836
Whoa.

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:06.736
Is that?

01:28:08.806 --> 01:28:09.672
Yes.

01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:12.043
I can just...

01:28:12.076 --> 01:28:13.643
Yes, daddy.

01:28:13.676 --> 01:28:14.677
He's real nice.

01:28:14.711 --> 01:28:16.147
He's always been there for me.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:18.681
And you can talk
to him any time.

01:28:25.756 --> 01:28:27.124
I feel,

01:28:27.158 --> 01:28:28.225
I don't know.

01:28:30.094 --> 01:28:32.063
It's hard to explain.

01:28:32.096 --> 01:28:35.933
I'm just really, I'm not
nervous or anything, but, whoa.

01:28:35.966 --> 01:28:38.169
It's okay, it's okay.

01:28:38.202 --> 01:28:39.336
You can go.

01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:40.737
Just let it go.

01:28:41.704 --> 01:28:42.572
Go.

01:28:57.388 --> 01:28:58.255
Hey.

01:28:59.689 --> 01:29:00.825
Where are you?

01:29:00.858 --> 01:29:03.360
I'm on the Mercy
ship right now.

01:29:03.394 --> 01:29:06.263
We had to go to port because
the weather's been so bad.

01:29:06.297 --> 01:29:08.966
So I think I found
the one room on ship

01:29:08.999 --> 01:29:12.770
that actually has
a wifi connection.

01:29:12.803 --> 01:29:14.138
Wow.

01:29:14.171 --> 01:29:16.841
I just wanted to
check with you, you know

01:29:16.874 --> 01:29:19.676
and see how you're doing.

01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:20.778
Yeah, yeah.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.614
I'm doing okay.

01:29:28.718 --> 01:29:29.787
Oh, a,

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.356
I, I got the
boulder out finally.

01:29:34.225 --> 01:29:35.192
Mount Rushmore?

01:29:35.226 --> 01:29:37.061
You got rid of the boulder?

01:29:37.094 --> 01:29:38.329
No way.

01:29:46.103 --> 01:29:48.272
It was a bit of a miracle.

01:29:48.305 --> 01:29:50.241
I can only imagine.

01:29:50.274 --> 01:29:51.775
So.

01:29:51.809 --> 01:29:55.678
So how are you really
feeling these days?

01:29:55.712 --> 01:29:56.981
Everything okay?

01:30:01.886 --> 01:30:02.752
Yeah.

01:30:05.122 --> 01:30:05.990
I'm okay.

01:30:08.425 --> 01:30:09.293
I'm just,

01:30:12.296 --> 01:30:16.233
just trying to figure out
what to do next, that's all.

01:30:16.267 --> 01:30:18.335
Okay, well that's good.

01:30:18.369 --> 01:30:21.438
Elizabeth wanted
me to quit my job.

01:30:22.739 --> 01:30:24.775
Okay.

01:30:24.808 --> 01:30:27.111
And it was just the,

01:30:27.144 --> 01:30:29.113
the night shift, the long hours,

01:30:29.146 --> 01:30:30.014
it's just,

01:30:31.048 --> 01:30:33.918
it's just wearing me out.

01:30:33.951 --> 01:30:35.685
So why didn't you?

01:30:44.862 --> 01:30:45.728
I don't,

01:30:46.964 --> 01:30:47.831
I don't know.

01:30:47.865 --> 01:30:48.731
I guess,

01:30:49.767 --> 01:30:54.338
I guess I was just
procrastinating a lot, you know.

01:30:54.371 --> 01:30:57.341
She always said I was
a real procrastinator,

01:30:57.374 --> 01:30:59.109
overthinking things.

01:31:01.312 --> 01:31:02.146
But now,

01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:09.153
now that she's gone, I guess,

01:31:12.323 --> 01:31:13.390
I don't know.

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:16.260
I don't know.

01:31:16.293 --> 01:31:19.763
You know, God speaks
to us all the time.

01:31:21.031 --> 01:31:23.000
And those closest to us

01:31:25.102 --> 01:31:28.105
can be some of God's
loudest voices.

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:33.010
So if she was telling
you to do this,

01:31:34.812 --> 01:31:37.982
and I don't know,
maybe you should.

01:31:38.015 --> 01:31:40.251
I mean this could be

01:31:40.284 --> 01:31:42.752
the next phase in your life.

01:31:43.487 --> 01:31:44.355
Yeah.

01:31:47.424 --> 01:31:51.128
Keep your chin
up brother, okay.

01:31:51.161 --> 01:31:52.029
Okay.

01:31:53.964 --> 01:31:55.933
Talk to you soon.

01:31:55.966 --> 01:31:56.834
Okay.

01:32:25.162 --> 01:32:27.598
Goodbye, old friend.

01:33:25.255 --> 01:33:27.991
Yep, gonna need the old roadmap.

01:33:38.402 --> 01:33:40.204
Okay, honey, you win.

01:33:44.274 --> 01:33:45.876
Time for a change.

01:33:47.111 --> 01:33:47.978
Yeah.

01:33:50.514 --> 01:33:51.382
All right.

01:34:01.024 --> 01:34:02.393
All right.

01:34:17.441 --> 01:34:18.308
Hey God,

01:34:22.479 --> 01:34:23.614
it's me again.

01:34:27.484 --> 01:34:29.586
I know it's been a while.

01:34:31.588 --> 01:34:32.923
I'm sorry, but

01:34:37.461 --> 01:34:38.328
I can't

01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:44.435
really comprehend everything
that's happened, but

01:34:44.468 --> 01:34:48.572
somehow it's all gonna
make sense in the end.

01:34:48.605 --> 01:34:50.007
You have a plan.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.609
And I just got to
trust it, I guess.

01:34:56.613 --> 01:34:57.481
Anyway,

01:34:59.483 --> 01:35:01.318
Elizabeth wanted
me to change jobs

01:35:01.351 --> 01:35:05.222
and I know I should have
done this earlier, but

01:35:05.255 --> 01:35:06.590
I'm doing it now.

01:35:11.495 --> 01:35:13.363
I wasted so much time.

01:35:14.631 --> 01:35:17.267
I spent so much time
trying to fix things,

01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:19.002
and my own strength
trying to make it work,

01:35:19.036 --> 01:35:21.038
and my own strength and,

01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:25.108
I should've done this earlier.

01:35:39.122 --> 01:35:39.990
Well,

01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.195
it's not over yet, huh.

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:52.102
It's not over yet.

01:36:22.299 --> 01:36:24.668
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming.

01:37:21.224 --> 01:37:23.360
Daddy, wake up.

01:37:24.929 --> 01:37:26.330
Daddy, wake up.

01:37:45.649 --> 01:37:46.884
Now I get it.

01:37:48.719 --> 01:37:50.855
I was lost, now I'm found.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.442
Come and
sit with me, Jonathan.

01:38:29.761 --> 01:38:32.295
I'm really happy you're here.

01:38:33.965 --> 01:38:37.401
This is, this is pretty cool.

01:38:37.434 --> 01:38:39.236
Yes, Jonathan.

01:38:39.269 --> 01:38:40.203
Yes, it is.

01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:42.907
So,

01:38:43.875 --> 01:38:47.611
are you ready for the
next part of your life?

01:38:49.713 --> 01:38:50.580
Yeah.

01:38:52.884 --> 01:38:54.284
Did you know that many people

01:38:54.317 --> 01:38:56.319
have been waiting
for you, Jonathan?

01:38:56.353 --> 01:38:58.555
Especially Rachel.

01:38:58.588 --> 01:39:00.424
She watched with
great excitement

01:39:00.457 --> 01:39:02.292
as I worked in your life.

01:39:02.325 --> 01:39:04.261
And she saw your faith grow.

01:39:04.294 --> 01:39:06.430
And as it grew, it
turned into trust

01:39:06.463 --> 01:39:08.866
and trust blossomed into love.

01:39:10.034 --> 01:39:11.735
From the day of your
salvation until now,

01:39:11.769 --> 01:39:13.303
I've been with you,

01:39:13.336 --> 01:39:15.739
guiding you and directing you.

01:39:16.874 --> 01:39:20.644
I have loved you with
an everlasting love.

01:39:20.677 --> 01:39:22.612
Now rejoice and be glad

01:39:23.848 --> 01:39:25.883
for great is your reward.

01:39:27.551 --> 01:39:30.253
You are receiving your
inheritance that can never perish,

01:39:30.287 --> 01:39:31.421
spoil or fade.

01:39:32.757 --> 01:39:34.357
All this is yours.

01:39:37.627 --> 01:39:39.596
Welcome home, my son.

01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:15.298
Pretty amazing, right?

01:40:15.332 --> 01:40:16.000
Yeah.

01:40:17.367 --> 01:40:19.804
How long was he with him for?

01:40:19.837 --> 01:40:22.572
Oh, a thousand
years is like a day.

01:40:22.606 --> 01:40:25.275
A day is like a thousand years.

01:40:26.778 --> 01:40:27.912
It's incredible.

01:40:27.945 --> 01:40:29.080
I know.

01:40:29.113 --> 01:40:30.915
He went through my
whole entire life,

01:40:30.948 --> 01:40:32.549
like my childhood.

01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:35.752
Every day, every second is,

01:40:37.955 --> 01:40:39.523
all the times I
thought I was alone,

01:40:39.556 --> 01:40:42.526
all the times I thought
He wasn't there,

01:40:42.559 --> 01:40:43.761
He was with me.

01:40:45.562 --> 01:40:47.664
He talked to me
about how He was,

01:40:47.697 --> 01:40:49.934
He was raising Rachel
all these years,

01:40:49.967 --> 01:40:51.635
taking care of her.

01:40:52.702 --> 01:40:53.570
And then,

01:40:55.739 --> 01:40:58.843
He just went so
deep into my heart

01:40:58.876 --> 01:41:02.013
that He just took
away all the pain,

01:41:02.046 --> 01:41:03.413
all that burden,

01:41:03.446 --> 01:41:06.750
and all that stuff that
I've been carrying.

01:41:07.985 --> 01:41:09.653
Just left me with...

01:41:09.686 --> 01:41:10.520
Peace.

01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:14.424
Peace.

01:41:21.731 --> 01:41:23.835
Jonathan, so good to see you.

01:41:23.868 --> 01:41:25.569
Pops, how are you?

01:41:25.602 --> 01:41:26.838
So how's old Betsy going?

01:41:26.871 --> 01:41:28.973
Well, she was going
right to the very end.

01:41:29.006 --> 01:41:29.974
Wow.

01:41:30.007 --> 01:41:31.408
She outlived me by 15 years.

01:41:31.441 --> 01:41:32.109
Not bad.

01:41:33.077 --> 01:41:34.444
Yeah, she was pretty reliable.

01:41:34.477 --> 01:41:36.981
I'm just glad she
got you both around.

01:41:37.014 --> 01:41:39.649
I just want to say thank
you for the, for the roadmap.

01:41:39.683 --> 01:41:40.985
Better than a GPS.

01:41:41.018 --> 01:41:42.686
Yeah, that's right.

01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:45.790
Now, have you tried
Elizabeth's apple pie here?

01:41:45.823 --> 01:41:46.791
It's even better.

01:41:46.824 --> 01:41:47.925
I know.

01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:48.658
Every bite is better
than the last.

01:41:48.692 --> 01:41:49.392
That's right.

01:41:49.426 --> 01:41:50.094
And

01:41:51.728 --> 01:41:53.563
it never runs out.

01:41:53.597 --> 01:41:54.431
That's right.

01:42:05.009 --> 01:42:07.912
Let's give thanks.

01:42:07.945 --> 01:42:09.146
This is incredible.

01:42:14.584 --> 01:42:16.519
Our father,

01:42:16.553 --> 01:42:17.822
who art in Heaven

01:42:18.789 --> 01:42:21.158
hallowed be thy name.

01:42:21.192 --> 01:42:23.627
Thy kingdom has come.

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:26.030
Thy will is done in Heaven.

01:42:26.063 --> 01:42:28.698
Thank you for our daily bread,

01:42:28.732 --> 01:42:31.735
and for forgiving
us of all our sins.

01:42:31.769 --> 01:42:34.906
Thank you for wiping
away all our tears.

01:42:34.939 --> 01:42:38.009
Thank you for delivering
us from all evil.

01:42:38.042 --> 01:42:40.111
For thine is the kingdom,

01:42:40.144 --> 01:42:41.178
and the power,

01:42:41.212 --> 01:42:42.646
