WEBVTT

00:01.442 --> 00:02.771
When do they send the
paper to the printer?

00:02.772 --> 00:04.432
What if they caught an
error and sent a new file?

00:04.440 --> 00:08.785
"Not the Fake News: What Really
Happened the Night of the Protest."

00:08.790 --> 00:09.697
We have to fight back.

00:09.731 --> 00:10.799
I decided to shut it down

00:10.800 --> 00:12.633
until the future of Anchor
Beach has been decided.

00:15.003 --> 00:16.437
that Monte was still the principal

00:16.472 --> 00:17.672
and that Drew's vote doesn't count.

00:17.706 --> 00:19.907
- Where are you going to school?
- Not Anchor Beach Charter?

00:19.942 --> 00:21.609
No, we didn't hear good things.

00:21.643 --> 00:24.212
You took Emma to get an abortion?

00:24.246 --> 00:26.848
Jesus, you took a baseball
bat to Brandon's room.

00:26.882 --> 00:29.050
That art professor just called
me and she changed her mind.

00:29.084 --> 00:31.185
She's gonna help me put
my portfolio together.

00:31.220 --> 00:32.887
Ximena has agreed to let you shadow her.

00:32.921 --> 00:34.655
- Are those yours?
- I'm on a derby team.

00:34.690 --> 00:36.791
I wish I had somewhere
to unleash my beast.

00:36.825 --> 00:38.759
You do. Your art.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.011 --> 00:57.945
And we're off!

01:00.115 --> 01:02.316
Kick her out! She went out!

01:02.351 --> 01:05.086
Which one's Ximena?

01:05.120 --> 01:07.889
X-TerminateHER. She's got
the x's under her eyes.

01:09.424 --> 01:11.692
This is like wrestling on wheels.

01:11.727 --> 01:14.195
I think you should join the team.

01:14.229 --> 01:15.696
Yeah, right.

01:15.731 --> 01:18.065
What? You'd look hot in a pair of
those shorts and a little war paint.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.835
Ooh!

01:20.869 --> 01:22.603
I thought Drew shut it down.

01:22.638 --> 01:25.373
The underground paper.
We're calling it, Rise Up.

01:25.407 --> 01:29.176
I need your help slipping them
into lockers before school.

01:29.211 --> 01:31.712
Mariana, I can't get in
any more trouble right now.

01:31.747 --> 01:33.848
Ooh, hey. She scored again.

01:33.882 --> 01:35.583
Excuse me, we're talking
about something important.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.385
- Mariana.
- What?

01:37.419 --> 01:39.787
You could have told me
you were out on a date.

01:39.821 --> 01:42.056
You didn't give me a
chance, and it's not a date.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.257
Sorry.

01:43.292 --> 01:45.493
This isn't a date?

01:45.527 --> 01:47.228
I'm kidding. But, uh,

01:47.262 --> 01:49.530
maybe we can go out
sometime without your sister

01:49.565 --> 01:51.198
and the Chula Vista Trauma Kweens?

01:51.233 --> 01:52.567
Yes, please.

01:52.601 --> 01:55.002
- Tomorrow night?
- Sure.

01:55.037 --> 01:57.438
What do you want to do?

01:57.472 --> 02:01.342
Um... anything. Seriously,
I have so much going on.

02:01.376 --> 02:03.511
I got it. I'll make a plan.

02:03.545 --> 02:05.746
You know, it's not like I'm asking
you to get someone out of prison

02:05.781 --> 02:07.315
or prostitution.

02:07.349 --> 02:09.883
Or maybe you just don't care
because you're graduating this year.

02:18.594 --> 02:21.095
- Ximena, hey.
- Hey!

02:21.129 --> 02:23.631
- Congratulations.
- Thanks!

02:23.665 --> 02:25.366
It's so awesome you came.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.935
- Yeah, this is my sister, Mariana, and... Aaron.
- Hi.

02:27.970 --> 02:30.371
- Hey.
- It's so cool that you have a Latina team.

02:30.405 --> 02:32.673
And you're so badass. Does
it hurt when you get hit?

02:32.708 --> 02:34.775
Yeah. I mean, but
then I get to hit back.

02:34.810 --> 02:37.478
Is there another game?

02:37.512 --> 02:40.247
Oh, yeah. This is our
junior team, The Traumacitas.

02:40.282 --> 02:43.451
- You have a junior team?
- Yeah, 14 to 17-year-olds.

02:43.485 --> 02:46.153
- Their parents let them play?
- They would need permission slips,

02:46.188 --> 02:48.689
but yeah, I mean, most
parents usually get into it.

02:48.724 --> 02:50.024
Poppy!

02:51.760 --> 02:53.494
This is my little sister, Poppy.

02:53.528 --> 02:54.629
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:54.663 --> 02:55.763
What's your derby name?

02:56.664 --> 02:57.530
_

02:57.532 --> 02:58.799
I love it.

02:58.834 --> 03:01.168
You guys could join the junior team.

03:01.203 --> 03:03.704
As if our moms would let
us play a contact sport.

03:03.739 --> 03:05.206
Jesus wrestled.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.009
- Why treat girls any different?
- That's a good point.

03:09.511 --> 03:12.546
Go warm up. All right, I
gotta go. I'm their coach.

03:12.581 --> 03:14.882
Oh, cool. See ya.

03:14.916 --> 03:17.084
See ya. Oh, hey, listen.

03:17.119 --> 03:20.388
Forgot to tell you. You need to
get started on your self-portrait.

03:20.422 --> 03:22.923
- For your portfolio.
- Self-portrait?

03:22.958 --> 03:24.525
Yeah.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.500
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:07.469 --> 04:09.370
Thank you for inviting
me to stay for dinner.

04:09.404 --> 04:11.939
- Thanks for helping, Aaron.
- Unlike some people.

04:14.843 --> 04:17.278
So, uh, have you heard from Emma?

04:17.312 --> 04:18.745
Any idea how the team's doing?

04:18.779 --> 04:21.182
Well, they qualified for round one.

04:21.216 --> 04:23.984
What? It was all over Facebook.

04:24.019 --> 04:27.354
Besides, qualifying is the easy
part. We'll see how they actually do.

04:27.389 --> 04:29.557
- I'm sure they miss you.
- I'm sure they don't.

04:29.591 --> 04:30.758
I'm sorry, what was that?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.293
- Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

04:32.327 --> 04:34.628
Jude? Jude.

04:34.663 --> 04:35.963
- Jude!
- What?

04:35.997 --> 04:37.631
No phones at the dinner table.

04:37.666 --> 04:40.334
Hey, Callie. So, how's
your art class going?

04:40.368 --> 04:43.471
Fine. I just have to
do a self-portrait.

04:43.505 --> 04:45.573
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- I just wish that

04:45.607 --> 04:47.241
all my projects didn't
have to be about me.

04:47.275 --> 04:49.944
Well, all the great
artists did self-portraits.

04:49.978 --> 04:52.613
- Picasso, van Gogh.
- Yeah, but I'm not a great artist.

04:52.647 --> 04:55.282
I don't know how to draw myself.

04:55.317 --> 04:58.385
- Take a selfie.
- Seriously?

04:58.420 --> 05:00.287
You took those great
pictures of me on the beach.

05:00.322 --> 05:02.323
Yeah, but that was because you
didn't know I was taking them.

05:02.357 --> 05:04.658
How about we take candid photos of you

05:04.693 --> 05:06.594
and then you can decide which
one looks the most like you.

05:06.628 --> 05:08.763
How is it a self-portrait
if we're doing the work?

05:08.797 --> 05:11.398
That's actually a great idea.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.567
Thank you. I'm full of great ideas.

05:13.602 --> 05:16.971
But I don't want to know
who's taking what photo.

05:17.005 --> 05:20.841
Like, I want to find out
who sees me as I see myself,

05:20.876 --> 05:22.409
and that can be, like,

05:22.444 --> 05:24.178
the theme of my piece.

05:24.212 --> 05:27.214
Hm. I like it. We can all
drop them in your Dropbox.

05:27.249 --> 05:29.383
I have an idea, too. What if everybody

05:29.417 --> 05:31.352
writes my history paper,

05:31.386 --> 05:33.788
and then I pick which one
will get me the best grade?

05:33.822 --> 05:35.189
That's very funny. No.

05:35.223 --> 05:37.324
- Hey, B.
- You smell like French fries.

05:37.359 --> 05:38.592
Oh, yeah? You would too

05:38.627 --> 05:40.361
if you spent five hours
chained to a deep fryer.

05:40.395 --> 05:42.863
At least you aren't chained
to the house all day.

05:42.898 --> 05:44.765
Moms, can I go back to school?

05:44.800 --> 05:47.067
I'm sorry, were you actually talking
to me just then? That's amazing.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.803
Seriously, Moms. When can I go back?

05:48.837 --> 05:51.305
Who would have thought that
you would ever say that?

05:51.339 --> 05:53.908
Hey, well, I'm bored and I'm
missing out on everything, so.

05:53.942 --> 05:55.442
Look, we understand, honey, but...

05:55.477 --> 05:57.611
- _
- Honey, let us talk to your doctor, okay?

05:59.312 --> 06:00.748
_

06:00.782 --> 06:03.184
- _
- B, seriously?

06:04.218 --> 06:05.601
- Sorry.
- B! You guys,

06:05.605 --> 06:06.754
I am gonna start taking
away your cell phones

06:06.755 --> 06:09.060
before dinner every night.
It's getting out of control.

06:09.191 --> 06:10.958
But you get to keep
your phone at dinner?

06:11.193 --> 06:13.961
I am on-call, okay? This could be work.

06:13.996 --> 06:15.630
So, we're on for tomorrow night.

06:15.794 --> 06:18.229
Ooh. On for what?

06:18.263 --> 06:20.931
We have, uh, invited the new
neighbors over for dinner.

06:20.966 --> 06:24.035
- You invited.
- So, that wasn't a work text?

06:25.871 --> 06:28.472
Wait, are they bringing
their son? He's super hot.

06:28.507 --> 06:31.075
Yes, Logan is going to be there,

06:31.109 --> 06:33.310
as are all of you. Yes?

06:33.345 --> 06:34.845
Um...

06:36.048 --> 06:38.582
Actually, Aaron and I have a date.

06:38.617 --> 06:40.851
Yeah, I already bought
the movie tickets, so.

06:40.886 --> 06:42.319
- Really?
- Yeah. Online.

06:42.354 --> 06:45.222
Oh, you just... you didn't
ask me what I wanted to see.

06:45.257 --> 06:48.292
Because you told me to plan everything.

06:48.326 --> 06:50.594
- So, what are we seeing?
- You'll find out tomorrow.

06:54.466 --> 06:57.635
- I have work, so.
- And I have plans with Noah.

06:57.669 --> 06:59.336
Well, you can invite him.

06:59.371 --> 07:03.541
Wait, why are we inviting the
new neighbors over for dinner?

07:03.575 --> 07:05.509
We never did that with the old ones.

07:05.544 --> 07:08.412
As it turns out, Mom went
to high school with Tess.

07:08.447 --> 07:09.914
- What?
- Oh.

07:09.948 --> 07:11.816
- Talk about a small world.
- Really small.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.818
Tess was Mom's first girlfriend.

07:13.852 --> 07:16.220
- No way.
- Really?

07:16.254 --> 07:18.422
- Why would you...
- Wait, you're kidding!

07:18.457 --> 07:20.491
- Seriously?
- Mom, what?

07:28.392 --> 07:30.693
Hey. Whoa!

07:33.830 --> 07:35.898
So, when you said, "study"...

07:35.932 --> 07:38.034
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.834
We can talk to his doctor, but after
what he did to Brandon's room...

07:51.868 --> 07:55.104
We're gonna keep him home until
we're sure he can handle school.

07:55.539 --> 07:57.039
Agreed.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.375
He's still not talking to Brandon.
What are we gonna do about that?

08:00.844 --> 08:04.413
What can we do? Eventually...
hopefully... he'll get over it, you know?

08:05.749 --> 08:07.950
What are we gonna make
for dinner tomorrow night?

08:07.985 --> 08:10.586
Oh... anything special Tess likes?

08:10.621 --> 08:12.588
Okay, I wouldn't recall.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.690
I cannot believe you told the
kids that she was my girlfriend.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.192
I was just teasing you.

08:16.226 --> 08:18.327
I don't want them thinking
that there was anything more

08:18.362 --> 08:20.229
than a friendship between the two of us.

08:20.263 --> 08:21.764
They're our neighbors!

08:21.798 --> 08:23.599
Why are you whispering?
They can't hear us.

08:23.634 --> 08:26.736
I don't want Tess knowing I
had a crush on her. Come on.

08:26.770 --> 08:29.472
Well, I was just having a little
fun, and you set the record straight.

08:29.506 --> 08:31.340
Our kids have loose lips.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.909
What if they said something?
How awkward would that be?

08:33.943 --> 08:35.578
How do you know Tess
didn't have a crush on you?

08:35.611 --> 08:38.547
She did not. She's... she's straight.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.982
- You were straight.
- I was never straight.

08:41.018 --> 08:44.020
I was confused and repressed.

08:44.054 --> 08:47.823
Well, I'm just glad you're
not repressed any more.

08:47.858 --> 08:51.527
Oh, I'm... well, I may have
to take some convincing.

08:54.431 --> 08:55.498
Mmm.

08:55.532 --> 08:57.233
Mmm!

08:59.970 --> 09:01.637
Okay.

09:01.672 --> 09:03.606
- What?
- Gabe is entertaining.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.808
How do we feel about that?

09:06.910 --> 09:10.413
The Sea Breeze: Rise Up,
edition No. 1, people.

09:12.783 --> 09:15.151
I borrowed the garage for 30 minutes,
so let's get down to business.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.586
Taylor, great job on the lead story,

09:17.621 --> 09:19.488
"Why Monte is Our Rightful Principal."

09:19.523 --> 09:21.691
The timing is perfect
because there is a meeting

09:21.725 --> 09:24.460
with the Board of Education
tomorrow to determine just that.

09:24.494 --> 09:25.661
Fingers crossed.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.264
Okay, so, let's fold these in quarters

09:28.298 --> 09:29.999
so we can slip them into lockers.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.735
We need to get there an hour
early so we don't get caught.

09:32.769 --> 09:35.004
Do not be late.

09:40.410 --> 09:43.412
Wide-wise or long-wise?

09:43.447 --> 09:45.848
Do you mean vertical or horizontal?

09:47.517 --> 09:49.218
Yeah, yeah.

09:50.287 --> 09:51.754
Are you stoned?

09:51.788 --> 09:53.355
Yeah.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.924
Do you want to get high?

09:55.926 --> 09:57.793
No, I'm... I'm good.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.267
So, am I good in bed?

10:06.970 --> 10:09.004
Uh, y... yeah.

10:10.674 --> 10:12.007
Am... am I?

10:13.310 --> 10:14.844
I think so.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.713
You're not sure.

10:17.748 --> 10:20.416
No, no. What I meant was

10:20.450 --> 10:23.385
that I haven't had very much experience,

10:23.420 --> 10:26.122
so I don't really have
much to compare it to.

10:26.156 --> 10:27.690
But I liked it.

10:29.893 --> 10:32.294
So...

10:32.329 --> 10:33.662
you've been with a lot of girls?

10:33.697 --> 10:37.133
Uh, no. N... not that many.

10:37.167 --> 10:40.302
I've had a few official...

10:40.337 --> 10:41.403
relationships.

10:41.438 --> 10:42.905
I haven't had "official" anything.

10:42.939 --> 10:44.774
I'm sure a lot of guys
wanted to be with you, though.

10:44.808 --> 10:47.343
I was home-schooled, so...

10:47.377 --> 10:49.311
I didn't get out much.

10:50.714 --> 10:53.916
You have any brothers or sisters?

10:53.950 --> 10:55.951
Yeah, a little sister.

10:55.986 --> 10:58.454
She's ten years younger, though.

10:58.488 --> 11:01.290
It must be nice having
siblings so close in age, huh?

11:02.325 --> 11:04.126
Not always.

11:04.161 --> 11:05.528
Why not?

11:06.730 --> 11:07.730
Um...

11:08.765 --> 11:14.236
Jesus is having trouble
with his TBI right now.

11:14.271 --> 11:17.673
He just... he gets angry
and kind of explodes.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.877
Are you still playing for him?

11:21.912 --> 11:23.179
No.

11:23.213 --> 11:26.982
No, I haven't really been
playing much at all, really.

11:31.221 --> 11:32.955
Well, let's play now.

11:34.624 --> 11:36.258
Uh, I would,

11:36.293 --> 11:39.728
but I actually have a big test tomorrow

11:39.763 --> 11:42.665
that I think I need to study more for.

11:42.699 --> 11:44.333
Oh.

12:05.782 --> 12:08.350
You're installing security
cameras at the school?

12:08.385 --> 12:09.985
Some of the students don't feel safe

12:10.020 --> 12:11.921
after the lockdown and the protest.

12:11.955 --> 12:14.690
This will reassure
them, and their parents.

12:14.725 --> 12:16.292
Wait, of what?

12:16.326 --> 12:19.428
That everything they do is being
watched? How is that reassuring?

12:22.666 --> 12:24.600
Okay, so...

12:24.634 --> 12:27.937
we have looked over the contracts

12:27.971 --> 12:31.974
and since Ms. Porter hasn't
tendered her resignation,

12:32.008 --> 12:34.176
she is still the principal of ABCC,

12:34.211 --> 12:37.613
and was at the time of the
vote dissolving the charter.

12:37.647 --> 12:41.317
So, Mr. Turner, your vote was not valid.

12:41.351 --> 12:43.185
In that case we'll vote again.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.155
In the meantime, if
Ms. Porter won't resign,

12:46.189 --> 12:48.491
- then she's fired.
- On what grounds?

12:48.525 --> 12:52.428
She approved an LGBT sex-ed
class without the DOE's approval.

12:52.462 --> 12:54.877
- It was held off campus.
- And yet Monte required

12:54.878 --> 12:56.365
permission slips from parents.

12:56.399 --> 12:57.762
And to make matters worse,

12:57.763 --> 13:00.136
they allowed some kids to
attend without having them.

13:00.170 --> 13:03.205
- I allowed them to.
- Well, we received a lot of complaints.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.207
The only complaint was from Drew,

13:05.242 --> 13:07.176
who threw Monte under the
bus so he could take her job.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.944
- That's not true.
- Where are the parents then?

13:08.979 --> 13:11.380
Actually, they're
waiting outside the room.

13:12.482 --> 13:14.917
The Board is welcome to speak to them.

13:24.181 --> 13:26.016
Look who's not at Worlds.

13:27.818 --> 13:30.754
Look who's not either.

13:30.788 --> 13:34.090
I heard they advanced to the
second round. Without you.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.360
- Whatever. I have more important things to do.
- Like what?

13:37.395 --> 13:38.268
Like save our school.

13:38.269 --> 13:40.430
Why'd your mom put
security cameras everywhere?

13:40.464 --> 13:42.499
She didn't. That was Drew's idea.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.201
Just like shutting down the paper.

13:45.236 --> 13:47.237
You do realize that if Anchor
Beach goes private next year,

13:47.271 --> 13:48.872
we're gonna have to go to Union High.

13:48.906 --> 13:51.775
They don't even have a STEAM program.

13:51.809 --> 13:54.377
- This totally sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

13:55.579 --> 13:57.080
But we don't have to just take it.

13:58.182 --> 13:59.482
We can fight back.

14:06.424 --> 14:08.325
Jeez!

14:08.359 --> 14:11.027
- Why are you so dressed up?
- I'm not dressed up.

14:14.131 --> 14:16.299
Ooh. Why are you so dressed up?

14:16.334 --> 14:18.568
I'm wearing a dress,
okay? It's not a big deal.

14:18.602 --> 14:21.137
Hm. I guess you're really
pulling out all the stops

14:21.172 --> 14:22.806
for your big date with Aaron.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.240
Okay, look, it wasn't my idea. Okay?

14:24.275 --> 14:25.642
He told me to wear a dress.

14:27.211 --> 14:29.980
So, I saw that they made
it to the second round,

14:30.014 --> 14:32.782
- but I guess you already knew that.
- Yeah.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.085
I'm happy for them.

14:36.554 --> 14:38.488
- Right.
- I am.

14:38.522 --> 14:41.157
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't even like this dress.

14:41.192 --> 14:42.859
Well, you can borrow something of mine.

14:44.328 --> 14:45.795
Why is that funny?

14:46.897 --> 14:48.932
It's not. At all.

14:51.936 --> 14:54.471
Why do people keep scaring me?

14:54.505 --> 14:56.940
Sorry! It's hard to get
a candid photo of you

14:56.974 --> 14:58.008
when you're expecting it!

14:58.042 --> 15:00.010
Mariana, the neighbors
are gonna be here soon.

15:00.044 --> 15:01.511
Oh. Right.

15:06.217 --> 15:07.884
How... how is this getting ready?

15:07.919 --> 15:10.987
Trust me. It is.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.595
_

15:24.000 --> 15:25.960
_

15:31.061 --> 15:33.280
_

15:46.222 --> 15:48.672
_

15:48.673 --> 15:50.073
_

16:02.470 --> 16:04.205
_

16:06.506 --> 16:07.506
_

16:07.511 --> 16:08.945
Hey, bud. When you headed into work?

16:08.980 --> 16:11.314
I'm actually leaving now.

16:11.349 --> 16:13.049
You look nice.

16:13.084 --> 16:14.784
What? I look like I always look.

16:14.819 --> 16:16.319
Why so defensive? Oh, that's right,

16:16.354 --> 16:18.388
you're ex-girlfriend's
coming to dinner, right?

16:18.422 --> 16:20.624
She's not my ex-girlfriend,
okay? Your mother...

16:20.658 --> 16:22.359
Do you see what I'm talking about?

16:22.393 --> 16:24.394
Whoa! Dressing for Tess, are we?

16:24.428 --> 16:26.596
Okay, just because I
am not in my uniform...

16:26.631 --> 16:29.866
- You don't wear your uniform any more.
- I do... I do wear a uniform.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.569
I... I wear an ugly jacket,
a blouse and a pair of jeans.

16:32.603 --> 16:35.071
Okay, that's probably them.

16:35.106 --> 16:37.774
Here. Can you put that in
the dishwasher? I gotta...

16:45.883 --> 16:47.484
Hey, Aaron. Come on in.

16:47.518 --> 16:48.685
Thank you.

16:48.719 --> 16:50.687
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

16:50.721 --> 16:52.889
- I'm good, thanks. You look very nice.
- Oh, thank you.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.224
Uh, Callie, Aaron's here!

16:56.160 --> 16:58.762
Hi. Sorry, I didn't
have a dress to wear.

16:58.796 --> 17:01.364
- I hope this is okay.
- It's fine.

17:01.399 --> 17:04.067
- You look great.
- You, too.

17:06.404 --> 17:09.406
Thank you so much for having
us over. Everything looks great.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.906
Absolutely. It's our pleasure.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.910
And thank you for the wine.

17:13.944 --> 17:16.913
So, have you had a chance to meet
any of our other neighbors yet?

17:16.948 --> 17:20.684
Um, Mr. Nesbitt. And the Yorks
brought over some banana bread.

17:20.718 --> 17:23.185
Oh. The Yorks never
brought us banana bread.

17:23.220 --> 17:24.854
What are we, chopped liver?

17:24.888 --> 17:27.991
Just wait until you see what
Mr. Nesbitt does for Christmas.

17:28.025 --> 17:30.026
- He's, like, so into inflatables.
- Hey.

17:30.061 --> 17:31.962
Oh, yeah, sometimes
they blow off the roof,

17:31.996 --> 17:33.960
so don't be surprised
if you see the Grinch

17:33.961 --> 17:35.732
blow past your window one night.

17:37.001 --> 17:39.836
Stef, your dad was really
into Christmas, if I recall.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.339
Yes, he was. He loved
his nativity scenes.

17:42.373 --> 17:43.540
How are he and your mom?

17:43.574 --> 17:46.609
Uh, actually they ended
up getting a divorce,

17:46.644 --> 17:48.144
and my father passed away last year.

17:48.179 --> 17:52.248
But my mother, now, she is as...
what shall we say... feisty as ever.

17:52.283 --> 17:54.751
I'm really sorry to hear
that. I always liked your dad.

17:54.785 --> 17:56.653
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.687 --> 17:58.521
So, what was my mom like as a teenager?

17:58.556 --> 18:00.690
Was she straight?

18:00.725 --> 18:04.227
Like... straight... arrow.

18:04.261 --> 18:05.929
Goody-goody?

18:05.963 --> 18:09.165
- We got into some trouble.
- What? I don't know what you're talking about.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.167
Didn't you guys steal a car?

18:11.202 --> 18:13.570
- Wait, you stole a car?
- What?

18:13.604 --> 18:15.472
I can't believe I'm
just hearing this now.

18:15.506 --> 18:17.173
Because we didn't steal it,

18:17.208 --> 18:19.809
we... we borrowed it.

18:19.844 --> 18:21.544
Without permission.

18:21.579 --> 18:24.047
Yeah, okay, I and get grounded
for stealing a garden gnome.

18:24.081 --> 18:26.816
Hey.

18:26.851 --> 18:30.320
You stole a garden
gnome? That's hilarious.

18:30.354 --> 18:33.790
To be fair, Mrs. Blome
always left the keys inside

18:33.824 --> 18:35.592
- and she hardly ever drove it.
- Yeah.

18:35.626 --> 18:39.029
So we were kind of doing her a
favor, re-charging the battery.

18:39.063 --> 18:41.564
Absolutely. It was an emergency.

18:41.599 --> 18:44.367
- Because...
- It was an emergency?

18:44.402 --> 18:47.470
- ... we had tickets to the Indigo Girls.
- Yes, yes we did.

18:50.374 --> 18:52.542
And then you dumped
me for the cool kids.

18:52.576 --> 18:56.546
Oh, well, I was never cool.

18:56.580 --> 18:59.015
And, uh, you know, you started dating,

18:59.050 --> 19:00.717
oh, what's-his-name? That guy.

19:00.751 --> 19:03.353
And... and I never saw you again.

19:04.955 --> 19:07.924
Don't you kids get any ideas.

19:07.958 --> 19:10.226
It's ironic how you went
from a car thief to a cop.

19:10.261 --> 19:12.462
- Wait, you're a cop?
- She just made detective.

19:12.496 --> 19:13.596
Oh, congratulations.

19:13.631 --> 19:14.631
- Wow.
- Thank you.

19:14.665 --> 19:18.201
- Like father, like daughter.
- Oh, hardly.

19:18.235 --> 19:20.203
Lena, what do you do?

19:20.237 --> 19:22.772
Uh, I am the vice principal

19:22.807 --> 19:25.809
for the, uh, Anchor
Beach Community Charter.

19:27.478 --> 19:28.778
Wow.

19:38.484 --> 19:41.586
- Everything here is great.
- Kind of expensive.

19:41.621 --> 19:43.154
Oh, I'm paying. Don't worry.

19:43.189 --> 19:45.624
You don't have to do that.

19:45.658 --> 19:46.791
Yeah, I do.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.327
What, 'cause you're the guy?

19:49.362 --> 19:52.030
Uh, no, because I asked you out.

19:53.766 --> 19:55.433
Ready to order?

19:55.468 --> 19:57.569
Yeah. You like seafood?

19:58.638 --> 20:01.406
Okay, we'll start with
the shrimp fritters

20:01.440 --> 20:04.175
and patatas bravas.
Does that sound good?

20:04.210 --> 20:05.710
Sure.

20:05.745 --> 20:07.679
- You got it.
- Thank you.

20:15.788 --> 20:17.589
What are you doing?

20:17.623 --> 20:19.958
Helping you with your self-portrait.

20:19.992 --> 20:22.627
Oh, I just... I didn't
know you were gonna do that.

20:22.662 --> 20:25.297
Aren't you curious how I see you?

20:25.331 --> 20:27.265
Of course.

20:27.300 --> 20:29.801
Um...

20:29.835 --> 20:31.544
Everyone's been, like,
jumping out of nowhere

20:31.545 --> 20:33.271
and taking pictures of me,

20:33.306 --> 20:35.206
and scaring the crap out of me.

20:35.241 --> 20:36.675
Oh.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.444
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

20:39.478 --> 20:41.579
No, it's okay.

20:51.257 --> 20:54.826
I feel like such an idiot. I'm
sure Anchor Beach is a great school.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.362
The main reason we didn't check it out

20:57.396 --> 20:59.064
is because you don't
have a football team.

20:59.098 --> 21:02.067
It's fine, really. It's okay.

21:02.101 --> 21:04.402
So, Logan, do you play
offense or defense?

21:04.437 --> 21:06.504
- I'm a QB.
- Hmm.

21:06.539 --> 21:09.174
It's good you're tall. You
can see over your linemen.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.943
Did you know that the average
height of an NFL quarterback

21:11.978 --> 21:14.179
is between 6'5 " to 6'7"?

21:14.213 --> 21:17.749
I mean, of course, Russell Wilson
being an exception. He's only 5'11".

21:17.783 --> 21:19.551
Since when are you into football?

21:19.585 --> 21:23.321
Uh, I'm into a lot of things
that you don't know about.

21:25.491 --> 21:28.693
So, what about you? You're
a big guy. You ever play?

21:28.728 --> 21:31.730
Um... I... I used to wrestle.

21:31.764 --> 21:33.999
We just... we didn't encourage football.

21:34.033 --> 21:36.534
Oh, I understand. We struggled
with whether or not to let him play.

21:36.569 --> 21:38.803
As a doctor, you're not
concerned about concussions?

21:38.838 --> 21:41.373
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, but he loves the game, always has.

21:41.407 --> 21:42.614
And let's face it, you know,

21:42.615 --> 21:45.276
contact sports help boys
channel their aggression.

21:45.311 --> 21:48.546
And girls. Why are we always
left out of the contact sports?

21:48.581 --> 21:51.716
Uh, because girls channel their
aggression through tweeting.

21:51.751 --> 21:54.085
- Jesus.
- Oh. My. God.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.590
Does you're girlfriend...
who's on the wrestling team...

21:55.591 --> 21:56.778
know how sexist you are?

21:56.822 --> 21:58.757
I was joking.

21:58.791 --> 21:59.924
You better be.

21:59.959 --> 22:01.059
She'll dump your ass.

22:02.661 --> 22:04.763
We, um, you know, like football.

22:04.797 --> 22:07.899
- We understand the appeal.
- We just... we don't want our kids to get hurt.

22:07.933 --> 22:10.602
You don't have to play football

22:10.636 --> 22:13.204
to get hit in the head and
screw up your life, right?

22:17.576 --> 22:20.478
- Can I be excused?
- Yes, you may.

22:35.458 --> 22:38.093
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:38.128 --> 22:40.396
Sorry, I smell like grease right now,

22:40.430 --> 22:42.564
but you know what, I can
shower before we, uh...

22:42.599 --> 22:46.001
Jam? You don't need a shower for that.

22:46.036 --> 22:47.870
Where's your guitar?

22:49.606 --> 22:52.274
- Oh. You actually meant jam?
- Yeah.

22:52.308 --> 22:55.644
- What did you think I meant?
- I... I don't know, because,

22:55.678 --> 22:58.447
you know, last night "studying" meant...

23:01.051 --> 23:02.851
Why don't you want
to play music with me?

23:03.853 --> 23:06.021
No, I don't not wanna
play music with you.

23:06.056 --> 23:08.724
I'm just not in the
mood to play right now.

23:08.758 --> 23:10.826
Okay, well I'm not in the mood to study.

23:12.629 --> 23:14.029
Okay.

23:14.064 --> 23:17.132
Uh... so, what do you want to do then?

23:18.401 --> 23:20.069
I don't know. We could talk.

23:22.739 --> 23:24.206
Um...

23:25.408 --> 23:27.776
Okay.

23:27.811 --> 23:29.845
What do you want to talk about?

23:32.549 --> 23:34.249
You know, maybe you should just go home.

23:34.284 --> 23:37.619
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.

23:37.654 --> 23:39.688
We're just not in the same mood.

23:39.723 --> 23:43.192
And I actually have some real
studying I need to do, so.

23:46.763 --> 23:48.597
Okay then.

24:07.150 --> 24:09.618
I'm sure your neurologist told
you that damage to the frontal lobe

24:09.652 --> 24:12.554
can cause sudden aggression,
sometimes unprovoked.

24:12.589 --> 24:14.456
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we're
well aware of that.

24:14.491 --> 24:17.726
- He seems like a sweet kid.
- He is. He's such a sweet soul.

24:17.761 --> 24:21.563
He... he just can't control
these outbursts of anger.

24:21.598 --> 24:23.432
Well, from what you guys have told us,

24:23.466 --> 24:27.302
his physical and cognitive functions
have improved, and that's huge.

24:27.337 --> 24:29.972
Yeah. He really, really
wants to go to school.

24:30.006 --> 24:32.741
- Just... We're not sure.
- I think he should.

24:32.776 --> 24:34.265
Some of his frustration might be that

24:34.266 --> 24:36.378
he's not getting enough
social interaction,

24:36.413 --> 24:39.815
enough structure to his
day, and academic goals met.

24:39.849 --> 24:41.817
Yeah, that's a good point.

24:41.851 --> 24:45.287
But, of course, those things
can create added stress as well.

24:45.321 --> 24:46.688
- True.
- Well.

24:46.723 --> 24:48.490
Have you thought about
getting Jesus an IEP?

24:48.525 --> 24:50.692
Yes, of course I've thought about it,

24:50.727 --> 24:53.362
but we will have him evaluated
when we feel he's ready.

24:54.397 --> 24:56.165
Oh, this is your field.

24:56.199 --> 25:00.102
I just say it because I have a friend
who has a son with similar issues

25:00.136 --> 25:02.738
and she was able to get a
free one-on-one classroom aide.

25:02.772 --> 25:05.407
I definitely think that it's
something that we could look into.

25:05.442 --> 25:07.409
Yes, I know.

25:09.646 --> 25:12.748
Well, it's getting late and we
should start the long walk home.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.350
Yes. This was great. Thank you.

25:15.385 --> 25:18.654
- And next time we'll host.
- Well, there's no need to rush off.

25:18.688 --> 25:20.856
Thanks, but we don't want
to overstay our welcome.

25:20.890 --> 25:23.092
Okay, well, let me see you out.

25:23.126 --> 25:24.693
Come this way, through the...

25:24.727 --> 25:26.795
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:38.127 --> 25:39.197
So...

25:39.528 --> 25:41.770
what are you guys gonna
do about the paper?

25:43.130 --> 25:45.065
Um...

25:45.099 --> 25:49.135
Mariana's got some idea
but she won't tell me.

25:49.170 --> 25:51.838
Maybe she told you
but you didn't hear her

25:51.872 --> 25:54.074
because you play that game 24/7.

25:55.676 --> 25:57.377
What?

25:57.411 --> 25:59.279
Dude.

26:01.449 --> 26:04.584
You're, like, on your
phone, like, all the time.

26:04.618 --> 26:07.654
So? You're, like, high all the time.

26:07.688 --> 26:09.456
I have anxiety.

26:09.490 --> 26:11.624
I think you're just, like, checking out.

26:11.659 --> 26:14.527
I'm checking out? What
do you think you're doing

26:14.562 --> 26:15.795
when you're playing those video games?

26:15.830 --> 26:17.464
You're, like, obsessed!

26:17.498 --> 26:18.898
Okay, I'm not obsessed.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.667
I'm just engaged.

26:22.436 --> 26:23.436
What?

26:23.471 --> 26:25.505
Okay, stop it. Give it to me.

26:25.539 --> 26:27.941
- No.
- Just...

26:28.976 --> 26:31.077
Come on!

26:31.112 --> 26:32.312
No.

26:39.753 --> 26:41.387
Come on.

26:41.422 --> 26:44.023
This is way more fun than gaming.

26:44.058 --> 26:47.093
- Maybe.
- You're a dick.

26:50.831 --> 26:52.265
I'll make you a deal.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.402
For one week, you
don't play video games,

26:56.437 --> 26:57.670
I don't get high.

27:00.007 --> 27:01.674
Okay.

27:01.709 --> 27:04.410
But since you're still high,

27:04.445 --> 27:05.912
can we start tomorrow?

27:05.946 --> 27:08.181
- I don't...
- Just... Just give...

27:11.152 --> 27:13.653
So, what did you think of the movie?

27:13.687 --> 27:16.422
Um, you know.

27:16.457 --> 27:20.059
No, I don't. You haven't said a
word since we left the theater.

27:21.061 --> 27:22.395
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

27:22.429 --> 27:24.664
I'm just, like, really tired.

27:26.433 --> 27:29.636
- Okay, so...
- So, thank you for tonight.

27:29.670 --> 27:32.405
Um... I'll call you tomorrow?

27:50.691 --> 27:53.459
- Rough night?
- Not the best.

27:55.029 --> 27:56.396
I hear you.

27:56.430 --> 27:58.464
Hey, look at Jesus's photo burst.

27:58.499 --> 28:02.669
He didn't even bother to
narrow it down to one or two.

28:02.703 --> 28:05.572
- Look.
- That sounds like Jesus.

28:10.611 --> 28:13.012
I wish I was this girl.

28:15.049 --> 28:16.816
You are that girl.

28:24.858 --> 28:28.161
Wow. Harsh.

28:29.997 --> 28:31.864
You know, you're that girl too.

28:31.899 --> 28:33.533
Sometimes.

28:33.567 --> 28:35.568
But, you know, we all have
a bunch of sides to us.

28:35.603 --> 28:37.604
You're just complicated.

28:39.473 --> 28:41.474
In a good way, you know?
You have a lot of...

28:41.508 --> 28:43.443
layers.

28:43.477 --> 28:45.478
And that other picture is just

28:45.512 --> 28:47.313
you with some of them peeled back.

28:51.352 --> 28:53.119
Did you take this one?

28:55.823 --> 28:57.156
Maybe.

29:00.427 --> 29:03.997
So resting bitch face Callie
is just one of my many sides?

29:04.031 --> 29:06.266
- It's not a "bitch face."
- Yeah.

29:06.300 --> 29:10.703
It's you being defended. The girl
who sees you trying to see her,

29:10.738 --> 29:12.472
and shuts you out.

29:12.506 --> 29:15.041
You're like an old man.

29:15.075 --> 29:17.410
- Thanks.
- No, I just mean...

29:17.444 --> 29:19.512
you're an old soul.

29:19.546 --> 29:21.981
Must have had a lot of past lives.

29:22.016 --> 29:23.483
Mm. Yeah, well.

29:24.718 --> 29:26.352
I still have a lot to learn

29:26.387 --> 29:29.522
because I'm really screwing up this one.

29:29.556 --> 29:30.890
Brandon,

29:30.924 --> 29:34.327
you have to stop beating
yourself up about Juilliard.

29:34.361 --> 29:36.262
It's hard not to.

29:37.398 --> 29:41.000
Is that why I haven't heard
you playing music lately?

29:41.035 --> 29:42.568
No, what do you mean? I played with you.

29:42.603 --> 29:44.504
Yeah, because I asked you to.

29:44.538 --> 29:47.206
But I haven't heard you
playing for yourself.

29:48.309 --> 29:51.244
Well, for one, Jesus
smashed my keyboard.

29:51.278 --> 29:53.146
We have a real piano.

29:53.180 --> 29:55.848
And you have a guitar.

29:55.883 --> 29:57.617
I'm just saying

29:57.651 --> 29:59.819
don't give up on music

29:59.853 --> 30:01.688
just because you're mad at yourself.

30:09.229 --> 30:11.631
We've spoken with the
parents of the kids

30:11.665 --> 30:14.334
who attended the LGBT sex-ed class

30:14.368 --> 30:15.601
without permission slips

30:15.636 --> 30:17.770
and it's clear they only complained

30:17.805 --> 30:19.672
after the Parent Board

30:19.707 --> 30:21.607
made them aware of what happened,

30:21.642 --> 30:23.676
which, frankly, is
playing a little dirty.

30:23.711 --> 30:26.746
We also find that since
this was an off-campus event,

30:26.780 --> 30:28.781
not sponsored by the school,

30:28.816 --> 30:32.185
permission slips were
optional, not required.

30:32.219 --> 30:37.490
So we find no grounds on
which to fire Ms. Porter.

30:37.524 --> 30:41.027
She is still principal of Anchor Beach.

30:41.061 --> 30:43.264
Then we'd like to place
Monte on paid leave

30:43.265 --> 30:46.332
until we can find cause for termination.

30:46.367 --> 30:49.235
There have been other
issues during her tenure

30:49.269 --> 30:51.804
which still remain under investigation.

30:51.839 --> 30:54.240
Well, if you want to pay for
two principals, that's up to you.

30:54.274 --> 30:56.242
In the meantime, I still retain my vote

30:56.276 --> 30:58.845
on whether to convert
ABCC to a private school,

30:58.879 --> 31:00.780
- yes?
- That is correct.

31:00.814 --> 31:02.682
This meeting is adjourned.

31:10.424 --> 31:13.993
It's okay. This buys us
time. That's what we want.

31:14.027 --> 31:15.695
Yeah.

31:20.734 --> 31:22.835
We offered to pay out your contract

31:22.870 --> 31:25.271
and say it was your choice to resign.

31:25.305 --> 31:27.373
But now, you are forcing us to fire you

31:27.408 --> 31:29.375
and ruin your reputation.

31:29.410 --> 31:31.611
You'll never get
another job in eduction.

31:32.613 --> 31:34.580
And you?

31:34.615 --> 31:37.083
One false move, you're next.

31:45.392 --> 31:48.628
If Mariana has a plan,
why won't she tell us?

31:48.662 --> 31:50.897
Unless she really doesn't have a plan

31:50.931 --> 31:52.632
and then the paper's screwed.

31:52.666 --> 31:54.333
I don't know.

31:59.940 --> 32:01.474
What was that?

32:01.508 --> 32:03.443
What is that?

32:03.477 --> 32:05.778
What's going on?

32:10.651 --> 32:12.685
- This was a really cool idea.
- Right?

32:13.754 --> 32:15.721
It's dropping fliers!

32:28.202 --> 32:30.603
Dude, it's the paper!

32:30.637 --> 32:33.606
- This is amazing!
- Yeah! She did it!

32:38.078 --> 32:41.280
- What the hell is this?
- Vive la résistance !

32:45.118 --> 32:47.086
What's happening? Why is it dropping?

32:47.120 --> 32:48.654
- The controller's jammed!
- Stabilize it!

32:48.689 --> 32:50.156
Stop yelling!

32:52.759 --> 32:54.527
Away from the trees!
Away from the trees!

32:54.561 --> 32:56.762
I can't! It's not responding!

33:12.045 --> 33:13.645
_

35:08.621 --> 35:12.857
And I don't just want you for sex, okay?

35:12.892 --> 35:16.561
I... I want us to be
able to hang out and talk

35:16.595 --> 35:18.563
and have fun

35:18.597 --> 35:22.634
and break into song like
we're in the movies and...

35:25.037 --> 35:27.238
And have sex.

35:31.744 --> 35:35.780
Okay. I'm gonna ask one more time.

35:35.815 --> 35:37.649
Which one of you was flying the drone?

35:39.452 --> 35:42.320
I suppose none of you know who's
responsible for this, either.

35:45.958 --> 35:50.161
Then, as of this moment,
STEAM Club is suspended.

35:50.196 --> 35:52.430
And if one more issue of
this paper makes it to campus,

35:52.465 --> 35:54.065
I'm canceling prom as well.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.302
We'll see how popular
you are if that happens.

36:12.451 --> 36:14.252
I never should have let
you talk me into this.

36:14.286 --> 36:17.088
I told you not to code it to
operate in full manual mode.

36:17.123 --> 36:18.957
This is why you're not at Worlds.

36:18.991 --> 36:20.592
You think you know everything.

36:20.626 --> 36:23.528
I'm not at Worlds because
I decided not to go.

36:23.562 --> 36:26.297
From what I heard, if you
hadn't taken yourself out,

36:26.332 --> 36:28.366
they were gonna push you out.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.268
Nobody wants you on their team, Mariana.

36:40.746 --> 36:43.748
- What happened?
- We can't do the paper any more.

36:43.782 --> 36:46.184
Why?

36:46.218 --> 36:49.521
Because Drew will cancel prom and
everyone hates me enough as it is.

36:53.325 --> 36:56.628
So, I know I was, like,

36:56.662 --> 36:58.830
the worst date ever.

36:58.864 --> 37:00.999
Not the worst.

37:01.033 --> 37:04.335
You know I went to prom with Lindsey,
but what you don't know is that

37:04.370 --> 37:06.771
she got drunk and threw up in my mouth.

37:06.805 --> 37:08.473
- Literally.
- Ew.

37:08.507 --> 37:11.209
- At least I didn't do that.
- No.

37:11.243 --> 37:14.112
But you did look miserable all night.

37:14.146 --> 37:16.314
What did I do wrong?

37:16.348 --> 37:18.950
Nothing, it's just...

37:18.984 --> 37:22.754
I didn't have a say in anything we did.

37:22.788 --> 37:24.455
Because you told me to make the plan.

37:24.490 --> 37:27.792
Yeah, but I didn't tell you to tell
me what to wear, and what to eat,

37:27.826 --> 37:30.595
and to pick the movie we saw.

37:30.629 --> 37:32.830
I'm sorry. I thought you would
like The Fast and the Furious.

37:32.865 --> 37:35.466
- Why?
- Because that's how you live your life.

37:36.569 --> 37:38.670
I shouldn't have said that.

37:41.941 --> 37:44.976
Look, I know that you were...

37:45.010 --> 37:46.911
just...

37:46.946 --> 37:48.980
trying to take care of me,

37:49.014 --> 37:51.449
but I don't like surprises.

37:51.483 --> 37:52.984
I've had too many bad ones.

37:53.018 --> 37:56.821
So, I need to know the
plan, even if you make it.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.524
Okay.

38:01.060 --> 38:02.360
Okay.

38:03.929 --> 38:06.464
And I...

38:06.498 --> 38:09.000
will try my best to not be the girl

38:09.034 --> 38:11.202
in that awful picture you took of me.

38:11.237 --> 38:13.338
I don't know. It was the
best one of the night.

38:13.372 --> 38:15.139
- You should see some of the others.
- No, No, I mean it.

38:15.174 --> 38:17.108
- Yeah.
- I don't want to.

38:53.479 --> 38:55.913
_

38:55.948 --> 38:58.883
_

39:04.023 --> 39:06.223
_

39:31.583 --> 39:34.619
_

39:43.395 --> 39:46.064
Chest up, guys! Chest up!

39:46.098 --> 39:48.032
Good!

39:48.067 --> 39:49.667
Hit it!

39:49.702 --> 39:52.236
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:52.271 --> 39:55.340
Um, do you remember me? I'm
Callie's sister, Mariana.

39:55.374 --> 39:57.375
Yeah, of course.

39:57.409 --> 40:00.278
So, I was wondering if I
could try out for the team.

40:00.312 --> 40:03.047
Sure. I mean, is it
cool with your parents?

40:03.082 --> 40:06.751
Yup. I, um, downloaded
the permission slip online.

40:06.785 --> 40:08.853
- Here you go.
- Sweet.

40:11.023 --> 40:13.424
Well, I'm hoping to change your mind.

40:13.459 --> 40:15.593
And your vote.

40:15.627 --> 40:17.628
If Anchor Beach goes private

40:17.663 --> 40:19.564
there's gonna be no accountability.

40:20.866 --> 40:22.100
Yes.

40:23.369 --> 40:25.303
Well, I appreciate that, thank you.

40:28.807 --> 40:30.808
How's it going?

40:30.843 --> 40:33.444
Well, most of the board is dug in,

40:33.479 --> 40:36.714
but it seems that at least Monica
Davis is gonna think about it.

40:37.816 --> 40:40.051
Have you given any more thought about

40:40.085 --> 40:43.888
what Tess suggested? You know,
getting Jesus and in-class aide?

40:43.922 --> 40:46.791
Suddenly you're ready for Jesus
to go back to school now that

40:46.825 --> 40:49.227
Dr. Tess, Medicine Woman,
thinks it's a good idea?

40:50.562 --> 40:53.264
Hey, I know that you are tense
about what's going on at school...

40:53.298 --> 40:55.066
And at home.

40:56.902 --> 41:00.004
I honestly just don't know
what to do about Jesus.

41:00.038 --> 41:04.041
I mean, we can't be in denial about
the fact that he is unpredictable,

41:04.076 --> 41:06.811
he's potentially dangerous.

41:06.845 --> 41:08.646
We don't know if he's
gonna get any better.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.982
He may be like this for
the rest of his life.

41:12.151 --> 41:14.051
To be honest, Stef?

41:17.556 --> 41:19.891
Sometimes I'm actually afraid of him.
