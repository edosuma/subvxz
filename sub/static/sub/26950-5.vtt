WEBVTT

00:05.917 --> 00:08.958
(dramatic music)

00:28.042 --> 00:30.250
(Harp): There's not a soul
on the wall.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.333
This place looks deserted.
- Scotland's lousy with castles,
could be the wrong one.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.292
- I know what I heard.
Benton's here.

00:35.292 --> 00:37.083
- Let's get your men ready.

00:37.083 --> 00:39.458
- Easy, Harp.
I need to know a bit more
about what we're facing.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.833
There could be a fuckin' 1000
men in there for all we know.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.250
- If what the girl says is true,
there'll be a dozen men
on hand.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.458
- Still, I'd feel a bit better
if we could have a wee peek
inside.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.333
- Benton doesn't know
you're here, Harp.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.292
We might not get another chance
with Miss Grace.

00:52.292 --> 00:54.500
- Oh, for f--
I'll go scout it myself.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.167
- I'd sooner send someone
I can trust.

00:56.667 --> 00:57.750
Angus?

01:10.167 --> 01:11.667
- Angus, wait!

01:14.792 --> 01:15.667
No!

01:16.625 --> 01:17.708
(gunshot)

01:21.583 --> 01:23.583
(growling angrily,
Chaulk shouting)

01:28.000 --> 01:29.375
(growling)

01:30.625 --> 01:31.500
(shouting, thudding)

01:32.625 --> 01:34.292
(grunting)

01:37.458 --> 01:39.417
(loud explosion)

01:40.667 --> 01:43.750
(theme music)

02:42.333 --> 02:45.417
(Chaulk): I was waiting
in the marketplace,
like Te Rangi said.

02:46.125 --> 02:50.208
But then, a Redcoat came,
and he held me up,
and he took me to Benton.

02:51.667 --> 02:55.458
He said he was gonna
kill Miss Grace
if I didn't do what he said.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.042
(breath trembling)

02:57.042 --> 02:59.500
I was just trying to help her.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.542
I'm really sorry.

03:01.542 --> 03:03.083
- You try and tell that to him.

03:03.083 --> 03:05.083
He's full of holes
because of you.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.417
- Well, I did try and warn him.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.583
Benton said he only wanted Harp.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.125
I didn't know what to do.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.625
- I'm not dragging my men
into this fucking mess.

03:20.625 --> 03:23.083
They're elite guards in there,
Harp.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.125
And they know we're here.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.458
Alright, lads. Gather your gear.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.208
They'll be coming for us
soon enough.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.042
(breath trembling)

03:58.208 --> 03:59.667
(door opening)

04:01.250 --> 04:02.792
- Oh, my dear!

04:02.792 --> 04:05.042
What a vision of beauty.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.417
- More like a painted doll.

04:07.417 --> 04:10.000
- Hm. Lord Fisher
will be arriving shortly.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.208
Once he's been coddled,

04:12.583 --> 04:15.833
we'll have you back in britches
in no time, I assure you.

04:16.208 --> 04:19.708
Now, tell me about your husband.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.500
(sighing)

04:24.250 --> 04:27.708
- Jonathan Chesterfield's
incompetence and disloyalty

04:28.083 --> 04:31.250
led to the escape
of Declan Harp,

04:31.250 --> 04:33.417
the deaths of dozens
of English troops,

04:33.417 --> 04:36.958
and the loss of thousands
of His Majesty's furs.

04:36.958 --> 04:39.042
- Too much malice, perhaps.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.875
Lord Fisher will be expecting
a little sympathy
for your husband.

04:45.708 --> 04:49.083
- It was only Lord Benton's
steady hand

04:49.083 --> 04:53.125
that saved my poor, deluded
Chesterfield from ruin.

04:54.208 --> 04:58.083
Without his gentle guidance,
he simply fell apart.

04:58.917 --> 05:01.833
- Hm... Better.
- My father.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.458
I want you to release him
before Fisher arrives.

05:05.458 --> 05:07.917
- And why would I do that?

05:07.917 --> 05:09.625
- Consider it
an act of good faith.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.292
- I think you misunderstand
my nature.

05:13.375 --> 05:17.417
I am not a man to
relinquish my leverage
on good faith.

05:19.167 --> 05:20.875
Furthermore,

05:21.750 --> 05:25.333
if you cross me tonight,
I promise you,

05:25.333 --> 05:28.292
I will remove
your father's tongue,

05:28.292 --> 05:32.333
and make him watch
while you eat it.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.292
(softly): Ah...

05:38.625 --> 05:40.542
- Alright, you've made
your argument, but--

05:40.542 --> 05:42.625
- I don't think that I have,
Michael.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.667
See, I am very vexed

05:44.667 --> 05:48.667
that you've put me
in the uncomfortable position
of undermining Mr. Grant.

05:48.667 --> 05:50.542
Not only in working
with Carruthers and Company,

05:50.542 --> 05:53.042
but in bunking
with Malcolm Brown?
- Pfft.

05:53.708 --> 05:56.250
Bunking?
Oh, that's ripe.

05:56.250 --> 06:01.333
As if I could possibly
get a wink of sleep with you
two feet away in the dark.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.083
- Keep your snotty
society rackets back in Montreal
where they belong, Pond.

06:04.083 --> 06:07.750
- Believe me when I tell you
that they're totally unpleasant
for me too, fuck face,

06:07.750 --> 06:09.208
but here we are.

06:09.208 --> 06:11.292
- Mr. Brown, you speak
as if there's some...

06:11.292 --> 06:14.625
element of fate at work
that is beyond our control.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.958
I'm a man that controls fate.

06:19.292 --> 06:22.500
Both my own, and that of others.

06:23.292 --> 06:24.542
You know that's true.

06:26.167 --> 06:29.042
And as I sit here
looking at you,
I'm starting to think

06:29.042 --> 06:31.667
perhaps I should tinker with
your fate.
(Michael): Sit down.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.792
- Tinker? Tinker?!
- Sit down.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.167
- Oh, Malcolm...

06:36.958 --> 06:39.083
I didn't mean killing you,
right now.

06:39.083 --> 06:42.500
I mean, a boy can dream,
but I was thinking
of something else, like...

06:42.500 --> 06:44.417
handing you over to Vanstone.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.083
- If you keep this shite up,
you can--

06:46.583 --> 06:49.792
You can go back to Montreal,
and fight the fucking HBC
on your own.

06:49.792 --> 06:50.958
(smacking)

06:51.667 --> 06:53.583
I won't have everything
we've worked towards
be compromised now,

06:53.583 --> 06:55.458
by your childish,
petty feud.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.167
Put that down.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.458
- Ooh, "Wilderness Michael."
So rough!

07:02.458 --> 07:04.000
It excites me.

07:05.250 --> 07:10.542
I'm sure I can find a way to
help Mr. Grant understand
this new business relationship.

07:10.542 --> 07:11.583
- Pfft.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.292
- You do that.

07:15.125 --> 07:16.500
- "Mr. Grant"...

07:18.042 --> 07:22.583
You go to great pains to
puff yourself up
as a business man in charge.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.542
But yet, when you talk about
Mr. Grant,

07:26.375 --> 07:28.250
you look more like
a devoted servant.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.333
Are you sure you're not just
his patsy?

07:30.333 --> 07:32.125
- Who's being childish now?

07:32.833 --> 07:34.417
(Pond): Anyway...

07:34.417 --> 07:37.625
I suspect that we will soon see
a grand show of force

07:37.625 --> 07:40.042
from that pugnacious
Governor Chesterfield.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.750
And this little partnership
of ours will all be for naught.

07:44.750 --> 07:47.417
(Michael): Chesterfield's gone,
we don't have to worry about him
anymore.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.792
(Pond): Eaten by wolves,
I suppose.

07:49.792 --> 07:50.875
- Oh aye...

07:52.375 --> 07:55.458
Too bad I didn't get to
do him in myself.

07:57.708 --> 08:01.042
(Pond): Maybe I should
turn my attention
to Mr. O'Reilly now?

08:01.750 --> 08:04.125
He should've been here by now.
- I know.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.000
But Malcolm and I can't go out
this room, you're gonna have to
find O'Reilly on the road.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.292
We can't oust Vanstone
with the help of him
and his men.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.917
- Well, there is a much quicker
and more efficient way
of dealing with Mr. Vanstone.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.542
- We kill a single Redcoat,
and we lose the Lake Walkers.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.625
That gun is just for show,
you understand?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.125
- Maybe.

08:22.417 --> 08:24.875
- Any of you wankers
O'Reilly's men?

08:25.333 --> 08:27.875
O'Reilly was the last to see
my prisoner.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.750
And now, they've both
disappeared into the wind.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.875
Is he here?

08:36.125 --> 08:38.000
- I haven't seen him
since last night.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.625
- Chesterfield's missus would
hide reprobates here
all the time.

08:42.167 --> 08:45.708
- I have no interest
in politics,
Lieutenant Vanstone.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.792
Emberly derived pleasure
from sticking her oar in.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.458
I like it the other way around.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.208
- Herman. Check the back.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.542
I'm checking your rooms,
Imogen.
- Go for it.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.833
(Vanstone): O'Reilly!

09:03.833 --> 09:06.667
(suspenseful music,
footsteps approaching)

09:13.083 --> 09:15.417
O'Reilly! Show yourself!

09:16.292 --> 09:18.375
(knocking)

09:22.583 --> 09:23.750
(Vanstone sighing)

09:25.792 --> 09:28.000
- Good morning, "Lootenant."

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Vanstone, isn't it?
- It's "Leftenant."

09:31.000 --> 09:33.167
- Forgive me, "Leftenant."

09:33.500 --> 09:36.000
Cobbs Pond. Pleasure.

09:37.333 --> 09:38.792
- You got a man in there?

09:40.417 --> 09:41.708
- Shh.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.792
As a matter of fact, I do.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.792
There is an exquisite
young man lying naked on
my bed,

09:47.792 --> 09:50.667
in a state of gentle repose.

09:51.750 --> 09:55.000
I guess my appetites last night
exhausted the poor thing.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.375
We could awake him together,
if you'd like.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.208
- I'd rather not.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.250
- That's a shame.

10:03.500 --> 10:07.333
Well, I was on my way
to look for Mr. O'Reilly too,
shall we look together?

10:07.708 --> 10:10.417
- Fine.
- Wonderful.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.208
(gasping)

10:49.125 --> 10:50.708
- What is this place?

10:51.750 --> 10:54.417
- O'Reilly surprised me
outside the ale.
He brought me here.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.792
Imogen paid him to do it.

11:01.583 --> 11:02.917
(Mary): I've already tried
everything.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.792
We're locked in tight.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.667
And there are armed guards.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.708
- Kahwihta said she was taken
by religious men.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.667
- O'Reilly's wife?

11:11.667 --> 11:14.375
- She helps capture our women,

11:14.375 --> 11:18.000
and he brings them here,
and makes them worship his God?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.417
- Europeans like their women
to be Christian before they wed.

11:21.417 --> 11:24.958
Churches need converts,
traders need wives.

11:24.958 --> 11:30.125
- And the ones who are not fit
are sent to the ale houses
and camps, to be passed around.

11:30.125 --> 11:33.667
- He's selling women
to more than just Imogen,

11:33.667 --> 11:35.458
and far beyond Fort James.

11:38.667 --> 11:42.792
(in Cree):<i> The man O'Reilly</i>
<i>has lied to you.</i>
<i>To your fathers and mothers.</i>

11:42.792 --> 11:44.667
<i>He is selling you</i>
<i>like meat.</i>

11:45.625 --> 11:47.125
<i>Do you speak Cree?</i>

11:48.625 --> 11:50.125
(in Ojibwe):
<i>Ojibwe?</i>

11:50.125 --> 11:53.042
- English. We must only speak
English, here.

11:53.042 --> 11:56.083
- Fine. Tell me about O'Reilly.

11:56.083 --> 12:00.042
- Mr. O'Reilly helped us
find our way to
the Lord Almighty.

12:00.042 --> 12:02.292
We had sinned against God.
- Sin...?

12:02.292 --> 12:04.250
(Mary): It's an affront to God.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.042
O'Reilly convinced
these girls' families that

12:06.042 --> 12:08.042
their troublesome daughters
would affect trade.

12:09.417 --> 12:13.250
(in Cree):
<i>You don't have to be afraid.</i>
<i>I have killed many such men.</i>

12:14.083 --> 12:16.333
<i>You belong with your people.</i>

12:16.333 --> 12:20.500
<i>Under the eye of the Creator,</i>
<i>not their white God.</i>

12:24.083 --> 12:26.208
Open the door! Open!

12:26.208 --> 12:27.583
(Mary softly): Careful...

12:30.958 --> 12:31.833
(grunting)

12:32.583 --> 12:34.292
- Be careful, Sister.

12:34.292 --> 12:35.792
We were warned about this one.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.292
- You've been sent here
to test me.

12:43.292 --> 12:47.083
But I will show you the way,
child.

12:49.042 --> 12:53.375
Your men will be here shortly.
Be ready.

12:55.667 --> 12:56.917
- Don't...

13:05.958 --> 13:06.875
(door closing)

13:19.833 --> 13:21.042
(carriage door closing)

13:24.917 --> 13:29.208
- If I jimmied the lock,
you could make it
to that rampart.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.042
- Not in this stupid dress.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.958
What would you do?
Fall to your death.

13:33.958 --> 13:36.917
- I'm not talking about me
going, Grace.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.167
- Don't pretend to be noble,
Da. It doesn't suit you.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.208
We're leaving together.

13:43.958 --> 13:48.667
- Once Benton has
cleared his name with Fisher,
we're just another loose end.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.042
- Well, then, I'll have to
make myself indispensable.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.083
If not to him, then to the HBC.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.667
- I know that scheming look
in your eye.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.125
I remember it from when
you were a wee lass.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.250
- Well, you didn't give me
much choice.

14:07.042 --> 14:12.125
Besides, it served me well.
- Has it? Look at you.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.667
- This isn't over.

14:13.667 --> 14:17.417
- If you see a chance
to save yourself, you take it.

14:18.417 --> 14:21.458
I've been anchor enough
my whole life.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.833
(door opening)

14:23.833 --> 14:25.917
(Benton): Our guest is waiting.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.375
I'm sorry, you won't be
joining us, Edward.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.917
But you haven't been forgotten.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.750
I hope you enjoy.
- Cow's tongue?

14:40.750 --> 14:43.125
- Cook's speciality.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.375
Shall we?

14:53.583 --> 14:55.833
Spirited woman, eh?

14:55.833 --> 14:58.292
- You have no idea.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.250
(door closing)

15:06.042 --> 15:07.292
(door opening)

15:07.292 --> 15:09.333
- Lord Fisher!
- Lord Benton.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.958
- It is such an honour
to welcome you to my home.

15:11.958 --> 15:16.542
Allow me to present
Mrs. Grace Chesterfield
of Fort James.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.417
- Charmed, Madame.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.375
You retain a remarkably
youthful beauty

15:22.375 --> 15:25.167
for having survived
in such a savage climate.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.250
- My Lord.

15:27.250 --> 15:30.042
- My recent years in
the London office
have made me soft,

15:30.042 --> 15:31.792
regrettably.

15:31.792 --> 15:34.083
I prefer spending time
in the field.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.042
- You must be well-travelled.
- As are you, I am sure.

15:37.625 --> 15:41.500
Sadly, untoward events
in Fort James bring me here.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.083
We appear to have
unresolved matters.
- My Lord,

15:45.083 --> 15:50.667
Mrs. Chesterfield has been
at the heart of operations
at Fort James for many years.

15:50.667 --> 15:56.167
And I thought it appropriate
that she share her insights
into recent events.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.750
- Most interesting.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.042
(Benton): Shall we sit?
- Indeed.

16:06.125 --> 16:09.000
(sighing)

16:12.042 --> 16:13.542
- Give it a rest, would you?

16:15.042 --> 16:18.000
- I mean, the least patsy
could've done
was bring us some food

16:18.000 --> 16:21.875
before he fucked away off.
I'm so hungry, I could eat
the 12 apostles.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.375
- I could use some grub myself.

16:29.542 --> 16:31.000
- Now hold up, now.

16:32.292 --> 16:36.542
I don't think the stale bread
in this shack is worth
you getting shot over.

16:36.542 --> 16:39.292
- I've stolen more meals
than you've eaten, Malcolm.

16:39.292 --> 16:41.167
I'll be back before you know it.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.625
(patting on shoulder)

16:42.625 --> 16:46.292
(door opening and closing)

16:46.292 --> 16:48.500
(indistinct chatter)

16:48.500 --> 16:50.958
(suspenseful music)

17:10.583 --> 17:11.750
(door opening)

17:22.917 --> 17:25.375
- Mercer?
- Michael?

17:25.375 --> 17:26.708
- You didn't see me.

17:29.417 --> 17:30.833
Is O'Reilly with you?

17:30.833 --> 17:32.583
He was supposed to meet us
here this morning.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.542
- I, uh... saw him at dawn.
- Here?

17:35.542 --> 17:39.125
- No, north. We parted at
Soulis Brook.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.417
- What's he doing up there?

17:40.417 --> 17:42.542
- He's, uh... picking up pelts.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.833
- Did he say
when he was gonna be back?

17:52.042 --> 17:54.083
Right, well, if you see him,
let him know that--

17:55.458 --> 17:57.250
(suspenseful music)

17:57.250 --> 17:58.458
That bow that you have there...

17:58.458 --> 18:00.833
Can I see it?
(chuckling awkwardly)

18:00.833 --> 18:02.625
- It's useless, mate.
It's shite.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.500
- Might be the case,
but I still need to see it.

18:10.958 --> 18:12.125
Where did you get this?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.125
I know the woman who owns this,
she wouldn't leave it
lying around.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.500
(door opening)

18:25.000 --> 18:27.167
No man could take this from her
without killing her first.

18:27.167 --> 18:30.042
So I'm gonna ask you again,
where did you get this?

18:30.042 --> 18:32.333
- Out by the-the road.
By the gate.

18:34.542 --> 18:37.208
(suspenseful music)

18:37.208 --> 18:38.667
(music stopping)

19:06.625 --> 19:10.583
- When I agreed to help you,
we were sneaking in. Unawares.

19:11.583 --> 19:16.542
But this? Nah.
This is just not possible.

19:16.542 --> 19:17.875
- It's worth the risk.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.542
- For you, maybe.

19:21.167 --> 19:24.208
You can risk your life
all you want,
I don't give a fuck.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.500
But I'm not throwing my men's
lives away.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.167
- I can't sit around here
like a goddamn coward,

19:29.167 --> 19:32.417
and let an innocent woman die,
when I know I could stop it.

19:32.417 --> 19:33.625
I don't have that in me.

19:33.625 --> 19:37.333
- I think she's gone. It hurts.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.958
You think you're the only one
that's suffered?

19:39.958 --> 19:43.958
I'll have you know, we've all
fucking lost someone.
- Then help me, goddamn it.

19:43.958 --> 19:46.500
- There's no way
we'll get inside
that fucking castle!

19:46.500 --> 19:48.083
- I don't need you to
get me inside.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.833
I need you to get me close.

19:50.750 --> 19:51.708
- And then what?

19:52.875 --> 19:54.167
- You just leave that to me.

19:54.917 --> 19:55.875
(chuckling)

19:57.042 --> 19:58.792
- Christ, you are damaged.

20:00.208 --> 20:04.042
Even if the lads agree,
how the fuck are we gonna
get you close?

20:06.250 --> 20:09.042
- My mother's people
have fought like this
for centuries.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.500
We are so few,
they have nothing
to ram against.

20:14.750 --> 20:18.042
They will rush into those dunes,
we will stretch them out,

20:18.958 --> 20:21.333
and we will drain
every last one of them.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.458
- Alright, lads.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.208
No one will judge you
if you want to sit this one out.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.042
Especially you, Angus,

20:34.042 --> 20:35.833
bleeding all over the place.
Look at you.

20:36.292 --> 20:37.875
You look fucking ridiculous.

20:37.875 --> 20:41.000
- Oh, fuck off. I've had worse.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.125
Besides...

20:42.958 --> 20:45.292
I've gotta bite the face off
the prick that ripped my kilt.

20:45.292 --> 20:46.500
(men laughing)

20:47.292 --> 20:50.333
- Alright, genius.
What's the plan?

20:54.542 --> 20:55.583
(Harp): Get up.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.000
You're going back in.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.875
I need something to write with.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.500
- Oh, I should've thought...

21:08.125 --> 21:10.542
We can write him
a really nasty letter.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.042
- What do you have for weapons
around here, smart ass?

21:21.208 --> 21:22.375
(thudding)

21:29.458 --> 21:30.625
(Harp chuckling)

21:37.000 --> 21:39.292
- Back again so soon?

21:39.292 --> 21:42.542
You should do yourself a favour,
girl, and disappear.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.542
- I'm here to see Lord Benton.

21:45.542 --> 21:47.625
I carry a note for him.
(amused chuckle)

21:49.458 --> 21:51.625
- Piss off.
- Oh, alright.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.958
But I'd hate to be you
when Lord Benton finds out

21:54.958 --> 21:58.958
that you've refused
a handwritten letter
from Declan Harp.

22:09.958 --> 22:10.917
- Very well.

22:12.292 --> 22:14.500
But if I discover this
to be a ruse...

22:15.417 --> 22:16.792
you will suffer.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.292
(Michael whispering): Kahwihta?

22:27.708 --> 22:29.083
- Mr. Smyth.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.792
- Look at this.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.750
This belongs to a woman
by the name of Sokanon.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.000
She's a friend of mine.
Would you remember seeing her?

22:40.083 --> 22:41.875
Where's O'Reilly?

22:41.875 --> 22:44.750
- He had to attend to
some urgent business
for our church.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.042
- Where's your church?

22:49.083 --> 22:50.833
- Near Soulis Brook.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.333
- Were you seen?

23:02.333 --> 23:05.250
- No. But I need to leave
and check on something.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.042
You stay here,
and stay out of sight.

23:07.042 --> 23:10.125
- What's so fucking important?
(Michael breathing heavily)

23:10.125 --> 23:11.542
- I don't know yet.

23:11.542 --> 23:14.500
- Oh. Alright,
well that's grand.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.500
Is that how
our partnership works, eh?

23:17.500 --> 23:20.458
You go off gallivanting around
doing whatever the fuck you want

23:20.458 --> 23:23.375
while I'm left here
trying to read
your tiny Irish mind?

23:24.375 --> 23:26.083
Where are you going, Michael?
- Malcolm, I...

23:26.083 --> 23:29.125
It's Sokanon, I...
Something's wrong.
She's in trouble.

23:29.125 --> 23:31.125
- Oh, well in case
you haven't noticed, so are we.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.708
- I'll deal with it on my own.

23:32.708 --> 23:35.375
- So, too right, you will.
- Just keep your head down.

23:35.375 --> 23:38.583
If you see O'Reilly before
I do, keep an eye on him.
See what he's getting up to.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.042
- What in the good holy fuck
is that supposed to mean?!

23:41.042 --> 23:43.792
- It means I may have
missed something along the way!
I don't know.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.708
If I'm wrong, we never need
speak of this again.

23:45.708 --> 23:47.500
But if I'm right,
the whole alliance may crumble.

23:48.458 --> 23:51.333
(door opening and closing)

23:55.417 --> 23:58.875
- Mind you, you Yanks
had the advantage.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.500
Fighting for your own,
in places you knew.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.417
I was fresh from Essex.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.375
Never even been to
the north of England,

24:05.375 --> 24:08.250
and suddenly I'm freezing
me bullocks off in Philadelphia.

24:08.250 --> 24:11.125
- Not everyone fought out of
a great sense of patriotism.

24:11.125 --> 24:13.000
I did it just for the sport.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.750
- What are you here for anyway,
Mr. Pond?

24:16.750 --> 24:19.417
Didn't Lord Benton forbid
your return to Fort James?

24:19.417 --> 24:22.458
- Well, it doesn't seem that
Lord Benton is here anymore.

24:22.458 --> 24:24.208
I didn't think it would be
a problem.

24:24.208 --> 24:27.417
- Yeah, well, having no Lord
or governor here is a problem.

24:27.417 --> 24:30.792
- Perhaps you're just the man
to remedy that...

24:32.167 --> 24:33.208
Governor.

24:36.250 --> 24:37.333
- You!

24:37.333 --> 24:39.583
You helped Malcolm Brown escape!

24:39.583 --> 24:41.417
- He attacked me,
Lieutenant Vanstone!

24:41.417 --> 24:43.833
- Nah, you traders
are all in cahoots.

24:43.833 --> 24:46.833
- Oh, Brown had help,
but it wasn't from me.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.625
It was Michael Smyth.

24:48.625 --> 24:50.042
(dramatic music)

24:50.042 --> 24:51.375
I wouldn't lead you astray,
friend.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.875
- Ah, the Black Wolf Company,
they're all animals.

24:56.875 --> 25:01.167
Smyth needs to be put in a cage.
- I agree.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.875
And I might be able
to help you out, there.

25:05.083 --> 25:07.000
I might be able to find
Michael Smyth.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.167
- How?
- You leave that to me.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.083
I'll deliver him up to you.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.250
And your men, well,
they'll be bursting
with confidence,

25:14.250 --> 25:16.375
that Fort James will flourish
under your grasp.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.250
- You saying
they're not already?

25:18.250 --> 25:21.375
- No, no, no, no, no.
Not at all, not at all.
You are the, um...

25:21.375 --> 25:25.417
Very exemplar
of strong leadership, so...

25:26.167 --> 25:29.167
It's quite thrilling, actually.
(Vanstone exhaling)

25:30.000 --> 25:30.875
- Bring him to me.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.125
- Did I just witness
the start of a coup?

25:36.125 --> 25:37.250
(O'Reilly laughing)

25:37.250 --> 25:38.458
- No, Sir.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.417
You were gonna give Michael up
to him?

25:42.417 --> 25:45.625
- It was just a ruse
to lure the Lieutenant, Malcolm.

25:45.625 --> 25:49.042
- I delivers him up to him,
right, but
under private circumstances.

25:49.042 --> 25:53.708
- Or we can deal with him alone,
and not have to bother
with all of those sweaty men.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.458
- But instead, you brought
his attention to you two.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.458
What in the good Christ
are we gonna do now?

25:57.458 --> 26:00.417
- Well, Malcolm, I suppose
we could give you to him.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.417
(Malcolm laughing sarcastically)

26:02.667 --> 26:04.583
- You can try that, patsy...

26:04.583 --> 26:07.042
And I'll beat the fucking crazy
out of ya.

26:08.167 --> 26:11.625
- What business did Michael have
that was so bloody urgent,

26:11.625 --> 26:15.375
that he'd run away,
and risk being seen?
- He wouldn't say.

26:15.375 --> 26:19.000
He was going on about his
Sokanon woman being in trouble,
but then he was out the door.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.500
- We're gonna have to
do something

26:20.500 --> 26:23.042
to convince Mr. Vanstone
that we're men of our word.

26:23.042 --> 26:25.458
- Well, I hope Michael
gets his arse back here

26:25.458 --> 26:28.083
before Vanstone figures out
what's really happening.

26:28.083 --> 26:30.875
(sighing)

26:31.875 --> 26:35.083
(soft, sombre music)

26:36.833 --> 26:39.417
(soft clinking)

26:53.542 --> 26:54.708
(man): Have a close look.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.292
(sniffing loudly)

27:08.958 --> 27:10.167
- They've been washed?

27:13.792 --> 27:15.333
Let me see their teeth.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.208
(Mary hissing)

27:17.375 --> 27:18.958
(nun): Obey him!

27:22.000 --> 27:25.750
- Good. Strong!

27:25.750 --> 27:27.042
And they're only young, yet.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.333
This one must be special.

27:31.333 --> 27:35.083
(nun): She has not
been converted yet,
gentlemen.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.167
- Pretty.

27:37.292 --> 27:40.000
I bet she looks even prettier
when she smiles.

27:41.042 --> 27:42.458
Show me your teeth!

27:48.750 --> 27:50.125
- Don't be rude, deary.

27:51.375 --> 27:52.875
You have two ways out of here.

27:54.792 --> 27:57.000
And I think you'll like theirs
better than mine.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.542
- Oh, yeah...

28:09.542 --> 28:13.333
I'm sure we can fit some prayers
in there before no time.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.333
(laughing)

28:14.333 --> 28:17.000
(grunting, screaming)

28:17.000 --> 28:18.292
(thudding, shouting continuing)

28:18.833 --> 28:21.292
(intense music, grunting)

28:24.625 --> 28:26.208
(nun screaming, whipping)

28:26.208 --> 28:27.583
(thudding, groaning)

28:30.750 --> 28:32.583
(moaning, grunting continue)

28:34.458 --> 28:35.833
- There are more men outside.

28:36.625 --> 28:38.375
(trader shouting)

28:38.375 --> 28:40.208
- Stop! Get your clothing.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.417
(music crescendoes)

28:41.417 --> 28:43.750
We go now.
(panting, screaming)

28:48.458 --> 28:50.083
(music fading)

28:59.292 --> 29:01.208
- Excuse me my ignorance,

29:01.208 --> 29:05.375
but what exactly is
the extent of this encroachment
by the French?

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
(Benton): Oh, the French
are a wretched plague.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.708
They have long been using
ignorant rogues

29:11.708 --> 29:15.250
to travel upriver,
and undermine our operations.

29:15.250 --> 29:19.417
- They are ignorant,
yet they are successful?

29:19.417 --> 29:22.167
They appear to be winning
the fight.
- My Lord,

29:22.167 --> 29:27.375
my position from the beginning
has been that, had I more men,
and more resources,

29:27.375 --> 29:32.042
I could have been more effective
at staving the bleeding.
- I must admit,

29:32.042 --> 29:36.333
I was surprised to learn of
your departure with the Phoenix
without my knowledge.

29:36.333 --> 29:41.958
- Yes. That was in response
to a desperate situation.

29:41.958 --> 29:44.917
- Oh, yes. The half-breed.

29:44.917 --> 29:49.292
- Declan Harp. He is a vengeful
and remorseless killer.

29:49.292 --> 29:50.708
- Is that so?

29:52.292 --> 29:54.333
- Declan--
- Given the right resources,
my Lord,

29:54.333 --> 29:59.208
this man can be apprehended
or silenced permanently.

29:59.208 --> 30:01.333
- Indeed, Archibald.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.917
But at this point
in the conversation,

30:03.917 --> 30:09.000
I am particularly interested
in the observations
of the Governess on the matter.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.292
- Yes. Yes, of course.

30:16.542 --> 30:20.250
- Declan Harp was once revered
as the most accomplished
trader and trapper

30:20.250 --> 30:21.542
in the James Bay region.

30:22.458 --> 30:24.167
- I wonder what changed.

30:24.167 --> 30:28.292
- My Lord, if I may...
I knew his father.

30:28.292 --> 30:31.083
He was an Irishman from Donegal,

30:31.083 --> 30:33.792
and a capable company man.

30:33.792 --> 30:37.958
He had a guide, a Native woman,
who bore him a son, Declan.

30:39.042 --> 30:42.917
When Declan's father
was betrayed by the savages,

30:42.917 --> 30:45.250
I took him on as my own son.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.417
I taught him the ways
of the trade,

30:48.417 --> 30:53.083
and watched him rise
to become one of our very best.

30:54.167 --> 30:57.292
But there was too much
of the savage in him.

30:57.292 --> 31:00.833
He turned against me,
and against the Company.

31:03.875 --> 31:06.208
- How was Captain Gray
when you saw him?

31:07.083 --> 31:09.042
- He was quite well, my Lord.

31:09.042 --> 31:10.375
- How nice.

31:11.375 --> 31:12.708
- I'd not seen him
in many years,

31:12.708 --> 31:14.875
so I was delighted
to see him doing so well.

31:16.125 --> 31:19.458
- You must have heard
the sad news that
he was lost at sea.

31:20.417 --> 31:21.917
- I did not know that.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.417
- Then, it grieves me
to have to tell you that
he is dead.

31:28.417 --> 31:32.000
- Oh, my God.
Oh, that's horrible.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.792
- I assumed you had heard
as much.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.292
- No, I had no idea.

31:36.708 --> 31:38.667
Oh, what sad news.

31:38.667 --> 31:41.250
- He was a kind and gentle man.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.750
- Yes.

31:45.750 --> 31:48.792
Grace, what do you know
of Captain Johnson?

31:48.792 --> 31:50.875
- He was murdered.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.708
- Was his killer
brought to justice?

31:53.708 --> 31:55.917
- His killer was not known.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.667
- Do you know why I am here?

32:02.667 --> 32:05.667
- I imagine you're seeking
the truth.

32:05.667 --> 32:08.458
- The Hudson's Bay Company
is facing losses,

32:08.458 --> 32:10.667
and I am hearing rumours...

32:11.417 --> 32:14.458
If I add together the pieces
of the incomplete puzzle,

32:14.458 --> 32:17.083
I am forced to infer
certain things,

32:17.083 --> 32:19.000
which I find troubling.

32:20.083 --> 32:24.458
Things that suggest that
the man in charge
of Fort James was to blame.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.292
- It's true.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.542
Jonathan Chesterfield
approached me shortly after

32:34.542 --> 32:36.667
the suicide of
Governor Threadwell.

32:37.708 --> 32:42.167
He asked me to assist him
in a plan to steal from the HBC,

32:43.083 --> 32:45.792
and to angle himself
as the new Governor.

32:46.917 --> 32:51.625
When I refused to help him,
he went on to threaten violence
if I did not marry him.

32:53.125 --> 32:55.500
He was so distracted by
his own ambitions that

32:55.500 --> 32:57.708
even when Lord Benton
was administering

32:57.708 --> 33:01.250
a just sentence of hanging
on Declan Harp,

33:02.208 --> 33:04.667
he allowed Harp to escape.

33:04.667 --> 33:06.792
- Who killed Father Coffin?

33:06.792 --> 33:10.625
- Chesterfield was in charge
of the men at the gallows.
I was not there.

33:10.625 --> 33:13.292
- And who was behind the theft
at Fort James?

33:13.292 --> 33:17.083
- A gang of thieves.
Working directly
under Chesterfield's nose.

33:17.083 --> 33:19.542
- Does the name "Michael Smyth"
mean anything to you?

33:19.542 --> 33:21.000
- He leads the gang.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.125
- What role did his Lordship
play in all of this?

33:26.792 --> 33:30.458
- Well, I'd be lying
if I told you he was the most
beloved man in Fort James.

33:34.250 --> 33:38.792
But I am quite certain
he has the best interest
of the HBC in mind.

33:39.917 --> 33:42.292
And I know from conversations
with my husband that

33:42.292 --> 33:44.875
he did his best
to undermine his Lordship.

33:44.875 --> 33:49.542
- Then, you will not be entirely
devastated to learn that
your husband is dead.

33:53.875 --> 33:55.542
- How did it happen?

33:55.542 --> 33:57.708
- He was last seen
with the half-breed.

33:58.375 --> 34:02.542
Apparently, he detained
Declan Harp, then let him go.

34:02.542 --> 34:06.208
Upon which, Harp promptly
betrayed and murdered him.

34:06.208 --> 34:09.417
- You see the havoc wreaked
by this savage?

34:11.542 --> 34:14.333
- What's to happen
to Fort James in his absence?

34:14.333 --> 34:17.625
- I have sent a man who will
reintroduce discipline,

34:17.625 --> 34:20.417
until a new governor
can be appointed.

34:23.167 --> 34:27.250
- I know every trader
and trapper that frequents
Fort James.

34:28.375 --> 34:31.125
I know every aspect
of administration of the Fort,

34:31.125 --> 34:33.333
and I know everything
that happens.

34:34.625 --> 34:38.000
It is my sincere belief that
in the best interest
of the Company,

34:38.000 --> 34:40.125
I should continue my duties...

34:41.750 --> 34:43.500
as Governor.

34:44.292 --> 34:47.167
- You wish to govern Fort James
alone?

34:47.167 --> 34:48.833
(chuckling): My dear,

34:48.833 --> 34:53.167
I'm sure his Lordship
appreciates your candour,

34:53.167 --> 34:56.375
but I'm afraid
that is simply not possible.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.708
- No one's as capable
of doing that job as I.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.125
No one.

35:03.625 --> 35:04.750
- Very well.

35:05.125 --> 35:08.458
If you can find a husband to
join you as Governor,

35:08.458 --> 35:12.708
you will have my full support
to continue as Governess.

35:13.833 --> 35:15.375
- I don't need a man
to hide behind.

35:15.375 --> 35:16.542
(door opening)

35:23.000 --> 35:24.583
- She brought a letter
for your Lordship.

35:28.125 --> 35:31.125
- I want all your men assembled,
and ready at once.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.083
(scoffing): Sir,

35:33.083 --> 35:35.167
Harp has threatened
to assault this castle--

35:35.167 --> 35:37.958
- This is Declan Harp,
and he's capable of anything.

35:37.958 --> 35:39.333
Assemble your men!

35:40.125 --> 35:42.875
- Yes, sir.
- Keep the Governess and Chaulk
out of harm's way,

35:42.875 --> 35:45.375
till we can deal
with Declan Harp.

35:46.292 --> 35:47.583
And Captain...

35:48.000 --> 35:50.917
keep her safe.
- Yes, sir.

36:00.667 --> 36:03.667
I sincerely hope
Harp is dumb enough to come
and try and get you here.

36:03.667 --> 36:06.417
- I hope you're stupid enough
to try and stop him.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.125
(door locking)

36:18.792 --> 36:20.250
(gasping)

36:21.042 --> 36:23.292
- Ms. Chaulk...

36:23.292 --> 36:25.375
What have you done?

36:25.375 --> 36:27.083
- What are you gonna do to
Miss Emberly?

36:27.083 --> 36:30.792
- I'd have thought
you'd be more concerned
for yourself.

36:31.583 --> 36:34.292
You've got into depths
way above your head.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.625
(breath trembling): What are you
gonna do to me?

36:37.583 --> 36:39.292
- My young lady...

36:39.792 --> 36:45.000
I'm going to show you
what happens when you
fail to do exactly as I ask.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.208
- I've already
given you everything.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.792
- You failed to bring Harp
to the gates.

36:52.208 --> 36:55.833
So now, you will tell me
what Harp has up his sleeve,

36:55.833 --> 36:59.333
so I can put an end
to this charade,
once and for all.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.500
- There's no plan, Lord Benton.

37:02.167 --> 37:04.375
He means to do what he wrote
in the note.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.583
Look, he's gonna come here,
with the others.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.792
He's gonna take Miss Grace
from you, and...

37:09.417 --> 37:10.625
- And?

37:12.375 --> 37:13.333
- And he...

37:14.083 --> 37:16.292
And he says
he's gonna kill you, Sir.

37:17.167 --> 37:22.500
(wheezing laughter)

37:22.500 --> 37:24.042
- Is he, now?

37:26.083 --> 37:27.625
(crying): What are you gonna do
to me?

37:28.583 --> 37:33.125
- I'm simply going to show you
that I am a man of my word.

37:34.458 --> 37:35.417
(gasping)

37:37.000 --> 37:38.125
(door opening)

37:43.542 --> 37:45.583
You should be proud, Edward.

37:46.708 --> 37:51.458
You've done a superb job
of turning that girl
into a fine woman.

37:52.917 --> 37:55.333
She has all the intelligence,

37:55.333 --> 37:59.333
confidence, and competence
that you lack.

38:05.125 --> 38:09.083
- I tried hard to warn her
of men like you,

38:09.083 --> 38:12.167
but it seems your kind
are everywhere.

38:13.833 --> 38:18.375
- I've spent my life
burdened by resentment of
my power.

38:19.250 --> 38:23.125
You have no idea
how hard that is.

38:30.917 --> 38:33.292
- It must be a difficult burden.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.958
Being born into wealth.

38:36.958 --> 38:40.792
Having done nothing to earn it.

38:43.083 --> 38:45.250
(stabbing, groaning)

38:45.250 --> 38:46.917
(sputtering)

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
- But I do clean up my own mess,
Eddy.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.875
At least give me credit
for that.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.708
(moaning)

39:08.333 --> 39:12.542
Ah!
(Chaulk breathing heavily)

39:16.958 --> 39:18.292
(Chaulk whimpering)

39:25.167 --> 39:27.708
(panting)

39:33.375 --> 39:35.625
- We shall return you home,
all of you.

39:35.625 --> 39:38.958
For now, I need you to go
to Kamenna of the Lake Walkers,
she will protect you.

39:38.958 --> 39:40.917
- We do not want to be punished.

39:40.917 --> 39:43.583
- No one will punish you,
you've done no wrong.

39:43.583 --> 39:46.042
- I was supposed to return
with a husband.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.042
Will this displease my family?
(twig snapping)

39:48.042 --> 39:49.375
(dramatic music)

39:52.083 --> 39:53.875
(thudding)

39:53.875 --> 39:55.833
- I'm gonna kill you
for what you--
(grunting, knife piercing)

39:55.833 --> 39:56.958
(grunting)

39:58.292 --> 39:59.333
(music stopping)

40:23.917 --> 40:25.625
- It was O'Reilly, wasn't it?

40:27.042 --> 40:29.000
- I saw you with him.

40:30.958 --> 40:33.167
Did you help sell these girls?

40:33.167 --> 40:35.875
- No. God no. I had no idea
he was involved in--

40:35.875 --> 40:37.625
- Then you're a fool.

40:37.625 --> 40:39.792
- I needed his men,
that's why I have an alliance
with him.

40:39.792 --> 40:41.708
If I knew, I never would've
joined with him.

40:41.708 --> 40:44.917
- You want men to join you,
but do not care what kind of men
they are?

40:44.917 --> 40:46.375
What would Harp say of this?

40:48.958 --> 40:51.458
- What can I do?
Just tell me what to do.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.125
- You've done enough.

40:58.667 --> 40:59.625
- Where are you going?

41:01.917 --> 41:03.958
- To bring these girls
to safety.

41:03.958 --> 41:05.458
Then to Fort James.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.667
(sombre music playing)

41:18.250 --> 41:19.375
(indistinct chattering)

41:22.125 --> 41:25.292
- I think it's time for me
to turn in for the evening,
Mr. O'Reilly.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.542
I need my beauty sleep.

41:29.250 --> 41:32.208
Tomorrow, we'll try again
to flush Michael out.

41:32.208 --> 41:34.875
- Strange, though, isn't it?

41:36.208 --> 41:38.375
He seems the definition
of reliable.

41:38.375 --> 41:41.542
- He seems to be, but yet--
(door opening)

41:45.333 --> 41:47.875
- You know who I want.
- Is it me?

41:47.875 --> 41:50.167
- Oh, very funny. O'Reilly.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.167
I don't have my prisoner back.

41:59.583 --> 42:02.458
- Uh, no. Not yet.
We're working on it.

42:02.458 --> 42:05.583
- Oh, yeah. It looks like it.

42:05.583 --> 42:08.333
I'll have to figure it out
for me-self.

42:08.958 --> 42:11.125
You want something done right...

42:11.125 --> 42:14.750
Oi! Shut up and listen!

42:15.250 --> 42:21.042
As ranking officer,
I am taking charge of
Fort James officially.

42:21.042 --> 42:25.042
No business of the Fort or
the Company shall be conducted
without my authority.

42:25.042 --> 42:27.083
(Redcoats exclaim, cheers)

42:27.083 --> 42:31.167
(Vanstone, muffled):
I don't want any parades
or celebrations from you lot.

42:31.625 --> 42:37.083
If you wanna get on my side,
bring me Michael Smyth
and Malcolm Brown.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.958
(Pond clapping slowly)

42:45.000 --> 42:47.875
- Jesus Christ,
he's making it easy for us.

42:47.875 --> 42:50.042
And Michael is shagging
everything up!

42:50.042 --> 42:52.042
- Michael knows something
that we don't.

42:54.625 --> 42:56.042
Sweet dreams.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.542
(dramatic music)

43:16.292 --> 43:17.833
(Barclay): Alright.
(Harp): Yeah, light it up.

43:17.833 --> 43:18.833
(Barclay): Let's go, let's go.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.625
(speaking Maori)

43:36.625 --> 43:38.750
(chanting Haka in Maori)

43:51.750 --> 43:54.375
(chanting continues)

43:59.875 --> 44:02.625
(chanting continues over
dramatic music)

44:10.083 --> 44:12.625
(men responding to chant in
Maori)

44:12.625 --> 44:14.292
