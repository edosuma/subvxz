Oh. Look, Emma, it finally came.

00:04.033 --> 00:06.100
My high school diploma.
It's so official.

00:06.135 --> 00:08.969
It's signed by the principal,
and the dean, and everything.

00:09.898 --> 00:11.297
God, I hated those people.

00:12.344 --> 00:14.327
Now, I know it took me an
extra six years to get this,

00:14.362 --> 00:16.212
but the point is, I did it.

00:16.248 --> 00:20.300
I also did my old high school biology
teacher, which was an added bonus.

00:20.335 --> 00:22.302
- She's so...
- Hot.

00:22.337 --> 00:24.220
Exactly.

00:26.707 --> 00:28.607
Wait. Do you actually
understand what I'm saying?

00:28.632 --> 00:29.509
No.

00:29.544 --> 00:32.429
That's a relief because...

00:32.916 --> 00:35.348
- Wait. You're lying to me, aren't you?
- Yes.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.318
Oh, my God. You really are my kid.

00:38.353 --> 00:41.221
Just know if Ms. Gilcrest ever ends up

00:41.223 --> 00:43.223
spending the night, that it
was just a very long playdate

00:43.258 --> 00:44.796
and nothing inappropriate happened.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.227
You buying any of that?

00:47.262 --> 00:49.312
- No.
- Yeah, didn't think so.

Thank you for an even better
morning, Ms. Gilcrest.

You know, you don't have
to keep calling me that.

I know.

You on your way back to the home?

- Riley Perrin.
- Riley! Hi.

01:36.194 --> 01:40.280
It's always fun running
into former students.

01:40.315 --> 01:43.316
Except when you've just
slept with another one.

01:45.153 --> 01:46.286
And you can call me Sarah.

but I'm just not that good a liar.

01:59.167 --> 02:00.250
I'm gonna go too.

Aw. Bye, sweetie. Have a good day.

02:03.171 --> 02:05.088
I'll see you at work.

02:05.140 --> 02:06.306
Okay. It was really nice to
see you again. Take care.

02:06.341 --> 02:10.175
Oh, my God! I can't believe you
hooked up with Ms. Gilcrest.

02:10.178 --> 02:12.228
After all the crap you gave
me about dating an older guy.

02:12.264 --> 02:16.182
- Name one time I've ever given you crap.
- Literally, five seconds ago.

02:16.234 --> 02:18.234
Dating someone a little older is great.

02:18.270 --> 02:20.270
She gets it. You know, she's
just here for the fun.

02:20.322 --> 02:22.155
No commitment. It's perfect.

02:22.190 --> 02:24.023
You know, that's exactly
what I like about Ross.

02:24.025 --> 02:27.277
You know, it's not some big relationship
where you're all codependent and clingy,

02:27.329 --> 02:30.163

You miss me?
You just left.

02:39.374 --> 02:43.209
Of course I'm thinking about you.
Because you're calling me.

02:46.264 --> 02:48.131
Give it. Okay.

02:48.183 --> 02:51.201
All right. I will take the sapphire
earrings that you're showing right now.

Okay. And you know what? And the
table that the earrings are on.

02:54.322 --> 02:57.123
You know what? And the
carpet that the table is on.

You know what? And the
pants you're wearing.

02:59.494 --> 03:01.344
You know what? Just give
me everything on the TV.

03:03.140 --> 03:07.283
All right, Mrs. Wheeler...
these are your boxes. Okay?

03:07.319 --> 03:09.302
It's bad enough I have
to deal with your crap.

03:09.337 --> 03:12.338
Now I have to sign for it
and carry it upstairs too?

03:12.374 --> 03:15.091
Look, Tucker, I just don't
want my doorman to think

03:15.126 --> 03:17.093
that I have a shopping problem.

03:17.128 --> 03:20.179
Oh, yeah. Especially since he already
thinks you got a drinking problem.

03:21.188 --> 03:23.199
Yeah, we talk.

03:23.235 --> 03:26.185
Look, whatever.
Look, I've got bigger problems.

03:26.221 --> 03:29.155
Okay, my husband has been
gone for three months,

03:29.190 --> 03:32.075
and the only thing that makes
me feel better is shopping.

03:32.110 --> 03:35.395
But then I get so depressed because
I have so much credit card debt

03:35.447 --> 03:38.298
that the only thing that makes
me feel better is more shopping.

03:38.350 --> 03:40.350
And now this conversation
is really bumming me out,

03:40.385 --> 03:42.218
so I'm just going to have
to go buy something else!

03:42.254 --> 03:43.436
This is all your fault.

03:43.471 --> 03:46.372
Is it me, or are Riley and
Ross constantly together?

03:46.424 --> 03:50.193
I just saw them having lunch, again.

03:50.228 --> 03:53.062
Lunch was our thing.

03:53.114 --> 03:56.049
- What's next?
- Dinner?

03:56.051 --> 03:58.134
Damn it! That was our thing too!

03:58.169 --> 04:00.069
All right, Danny, listen, honey.

04:00.121 --> 04:03.039
I'm sorry, but you have got
to stop thinking about Riley.

04:03.074 --> 04:05.308
You have a big playoff game tonight.

04:05.343 --> 04:06.426
You need to focus on that.

04:06.461 --> 04:09.329
You're right. The whole
team's counting on me.

04:09.364 --> 04:11.297
Nobody knows this, but
I'm starting tonight

04:11.299 --> 04:13.399
because our best player,
Gustav, is out with an injury.

04:13.451 --> 04:16.302
He slipped on the ice and
fractured his coccyx.

04:16.303 --> 04:18.321
Don't worry, it's not
what you think it is.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.242
You'll be great, Danny.

04:23.244 --> 04:26.179
You are gonna do great!
I believe in you!

04:26.231 --> 04:30.049
Oh, my gosh. They may as well
forfeit the game right now.

04:30.051 --> 04:32.793
Mrs. Wheeler, the answer to
all your credit card debt

04:32.818 --> 04:34.097
just walked into his bedroom.

04:34.122 --> 04:37.023
Okay, I cannot borrow money from Danny.

04:37.058 --> 04:40.076
I already have. Shh! Don't tell him.

04:40.128 --> 04:43.313
No, no. Bet against the Rangers tonight.

04:43.348 --> 04:45.431
With that inside information,
you'll clean up.

04:45.467 --> 04:48.301
Tucker Thurgood Marshall Dobbs.

04:48.336 --> 04:53.289
I would never bet against my son.

04:53.341 --> 04:55.224
Okay, when you say "clean up,"
how much money are we talking?

04:55.260 --> 04:56.192
Mm-hm. Yeah.

04:57.545 --> 05:00.113
Are you okay? You haven't stopped
smiling for ten minutes,

05:00.148 --> 05:02.365
and I don't really know what
the signs of a stroke are.

05:04.035 --> 05:05.435
I am just happy.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.021
I'm glad we've been able to
work things out this time.

05:08.023 --> 05:11.391
And I had a really nice conversation
with my mom about you this afternoon.

05:11.393 --> 05:14.293
Your mom? She's still alive?

05:14.295 --> 05:16.362
Okay. Um...

05:16.398 --> 05:18.247
You-You told her about us?

05:18.299 --> 05:20.283
Yeah, I told everyone at the office too.

05:20.318 --> 05:22.151
Oh, you did?

05:22.203 --> 05:24.170
I-I was kind of keeping that to myself.

05:26.057 --> 05:28.091
You know, Ben, I have to admit,

05:28.126 --> 05:31.444
I wasn't sure what to think when you
called me again, but this is nice.

05:31.446 --> 05:33.129
Yeah, it is.

05:33.181 --> 05:35.465
I'm just glad you're open to seeing
me as Ben the man and bar owner,

05:35.500 --> 05:39.435
and not Ben the underachiever
with the overbite.

05:39.471 --> 05:42.422
Well, you're definitely a lot younger
than anyone I've ever dated.

05:42.474 --> 05:46.325
But just because a guy is older
doesn't mean he's more mature, right?

05:46.361 --> 05:48.361
Believe me, I have been
burned a few times.

05:48.396 --> 05:50.396
Haven't we all.

05:50.398 --> 05:54.283
Burned. Betrayed. Led on. Jerked around.

05:54.319 --> 05:56.169
Kissed a lot of frogs.

05:57.255 --> 05:59.072
A lot.

06:00.241 --> 06:01.424
You know, I always thought

06:01.459 --> 06:03.443
I'd be married with a whole
flock of kids by now,

06:03.478 --> 06:05.962
but nope, still single.

06:05.997 --> 06:08.414
Not bitter. No, not bitter at all.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.384
But this is fun. And you have a kid.

06:11.419 --> 06:13.269
I mean, if things worked out,

06:13.321 --> 06:14.620
and we got married, and I
got pregnant right away,

06:14.656 --> 06:17.240
I'll be right on track and right
in line with all my friends.

06:17.275 --> 06:19.894
I mean, I'm just spitballing here,
but how old is Emma, again?

06:23.364 --> 06:26.215
Oh, my God. I'm a terrible person.

06:26.251 --> 06:28.267
I can't believe I bet against my son.

06:28.319 --> 06:31.087
Hey, look, if it makes
you feel any better,

06:31.122 --> 06:33.990
you were a terrible
person way before that.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.093
How will I ever live
with myself if I ever...

me just because I made

06:50.525 --> 06:53.259
a lot of mistakes and messed up a bunch.

06:53.261 --> 06:54.393
Yeah, it sucks.

06:54.429 --> 06:56.329
Oh, there, there, Tucker.

06:56.364 --> 06:59.148
Don't worry, Danny. You just need
to work harder on your game.

06:59.184 --> 07:01.117
Hey, Wheeler! You suck!

07:01.152 --> 07:03.035

- Finally.

What took you so long? I
texted you like an hour ago.

07:13.047 --> 07:15.014
Sorry, I had to wait for
Ross to fall asleep.

07:15.016 --> 07:18.985
Ten o'clock. Every night. He's on
a schedule, just like my grandma.

07:19.020 --> 07:21.320
Ms. Gilcrest starts her day at 6:00 a.m.

07:21.372 --> 07:22.421
For no reason.

07:24.025 --> 07:25.458
I guess the routine keeps
them feeling active.

07:25.493 --> 07:28.311
Riley, this has gotten way out of hand.

07:28.363 --> 07:31.230
I know. Ross told his mother about us.

07:31.266 --> 07:33.115
What? She's still alive?

07:34.252 --> 07:36.102
That's exactly what I said.

07:36.154 --> 07:38.204
You know what this is? This is my karma.

07:38.206 --> 07:41.974
Okay, so, maybe I got back together
with Ross just to make Danny jealous,

07:42.026 --> 07:43.209
Because maybe I'm still
hoping he'll apologize,

07:43.244 --> 07:45.511
admit he was completely wrong,
and we get back together.

07:45.513 --> 07:49.031
But now, the universe is punishing
me by saying, "Suck it, Perrin."

07:49.067 --> 07:51.400
Like somehow this is my fault.

07:51.436 --> 07:52.985
So just break up with him.

07:53.037 --> 07:55.421
I can't. Everyone at
work knows about us.

07:55.456 --> 07:57.406
If I break his heart
again, they'll hate me.

07:57.442 --> 08:00.359
Well, I just wanted to fulfill
a hot teacher fantasy.

08:00.395 --> 08:02.245
Now I'm just dating some
crazy chick named Sarah.

08:03.331 --> 08:05.097
So just break up with her.

08:05.149 --> 08:08.050
I can't! Not after everything
she just said to me.

away from boiling a bunny.

08:13.992 --> 08:16.058

would break up with me.

08:16.094 --> 08:18.010
But obviously, he's
not going to do that.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.946
Would you let all of this go?

08:22.083 --> 08:24.000
Sorry, that, um...

08:24.035 --> 08:25.384
Wait, wait, wait.

08:25.436 --> 08:27.353
What if they broke up with us?

08:27.405 --> 08:29.422
I know how guys think, what
they like and what they don't.

08:29.457 --> 08:32.225
I'll talk to Ross and convince
him to break up with you.

08:32.227 --> 08:34.159
I know exactly what to say
to turn him off of you.

09:52.879 --> 09:55.897
Tucker, no. We have a
clean bill of health.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.849
We don't need Dr. Bet.

09:57.884 --> 09:59.901
No, I need Dr. Bet.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.836
- Who's Dr. Bet?
- See? See?

10:01.888 --> 10:03.321
Danny thinks that I should call Dr. Bet.

10:03.356 --> 10:07.225
Uh, I'll tell him it's a
double-down diagnosis.

10:07.260 --> 10:09.210
I can't believe Danny is hurt.

10:09.245 --> 10:11.162
I mean, what are the odds?

10:11.197 --> 10:14.115
Seriously, Tucker, what are the odds?

10:14.117 --> 10:17.068
Not very good if we don't make
it down to the racetrack.

10:17.103 --> 10:19.086
Okay.

10:19.088 --> 10:21.873
Racetrack Presbyterian.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.875
It's a fine hospital.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.343
Okay, let's go.

10:26.396 --> 10:28.946
So, Ross, glad you could stop by.

10:28.998 --> 10:31.299
- We're friends, right?
- Not at all.

10:31.301 --> 10:33.918
Good. I just want you to
know that I'm here for you

10:33.953 --> 10:36.938
if you every need someone to talk to about
Riley, and how annoying she can be.

10:36.973 --> 10:39.156
Oh, well, is this Quantum Cop 4?

10:39.209 --> 10:42.143
Uh, yeah. You know who's a
quantum pain the ass? Riley.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.162
You play? Bet I can kick your ass.

10:45.215 --> 10:47.064
I doubt that.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.034
I'm ranked number two in
cyborg prostitute arrests.

10:50.069 --> 10:52.153
Oh, buddy. You're on.

10:52.188 --> 10:54.021
It's a good thing you're
dating a teacher,

10:54.057 --> 10:56.007
because you're about
to get schooled, son.

10:58.962 --> 11:00.845
Well, thanks so much for meeting me.

11:00.897 --> 11:02.964
You know, I just wanted to see how
things were going with you and Ben.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.900
Or should I say, everyone's ex.

11:05.902 --> 11:08.336
Trust me, "Ben" there, done that.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.255
Actually, things are great.

11:11.291 --> 11:15.142
Wow. He's really got you fooled.

11:15.144 --> 11:19.046
I don't know. I think he's grown
up quite a bit since high school.

11:19.132 --> 11:20.197
And so have you,

11:20.233 --> 11:22.166
my favorite straight "A" student.

11:22.218 --> 11:25.920
No, uh, not straight "A's."

11:25.955 --> 11:28.940
In fact, you were the only
teacher to ever give me a "B,"

11:28.975 --> 11:31.926
preventing me from being
valedictorian, but no bigs.

11:32.946 --> 11:34.912
You were the best student I ever had.

11:34.964 --> 11:38.232
With all those "A's," I thought
a "B" would motivate you.

11:38.268 --> 11:41.269
The moment I met you, I knew you
were destined for greatness.

11:42.322 --> 11:45.139
You did? Oh...

11:45.191 --> 11:48.209
Should we order some food and keep
talking about how great I am?

11:48.244 --> 11:50.094
Yeah, okay.

11:50.129 --> 11:51.979
Yeah! Uh!

11:54.033 --> 11:55.983
- Not bad, Wheeler.
- Thank you.

11:55.985 --> 11:59.086
No one's ever taken the time to show
me how to sever a cyborg's head.

11:59.088 --> 12:00.855
Ah, it was nothing.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.840
No, it was something.

12:02.892 --> 12:04.892
You're the big brother I always wanted.

12:05.962 --> 12:07.244
You have a big brother.

12:07.297 --> 12:08.829
I know.

12:10.300 --> 12:14.201
Well, Tucker, I might be a bad
mother who bets against her son,

12:14.237 --> 12:19.073
but if things go well, I will be a
rich mother who bets against her son.

12:19.108 --> 12:21.008
And I can live with that.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.145
And I can live with the
personal massager I ordered.

12:24.197 --> 12:27.098
Her name is Olga, and
she arrives on Tuesday.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.082
Oh, damn.

12:29.152 --> 12:31.085
I swear, Riley is everywhere I go

12:31.120 --> 12:33.020
and she still barely talks to me.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.955
At this rate, I'll bet we'll
never get back together.

12:34.991 --> 12:38.926
Bet? Bet? No, no, no. We don't bet
against people or sports. Not at all.

12:38.928 --> 12:39.910
Nobody's betting.

12:39.946 --> 12:43.230
Oh, hey. Shouldn't your
wrist be in a cast?

12:43.266 --> 12:47.184
Or a sling, or you know, something that says
the Rangers aren't going to win tonight?

12:49.105 --> 12:50.254
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you guys.

12:50.289 --> 12:52.056
The team doctor cleared me.

12:52.091 --> 12:53.941
He cleared Gustav cleared, too.
Isn't that great?

12:55.094 --> 12:56.177
So great!

12:58.114 --> 13:00.965
So you and Gustav are back in the game.

13:01.050 --> 13:03.851
That is amazing. Right, Tucker?

13:03.903 --> 13:05.086
(MUTTERING) What the
hell are we going to do?

13:05.121 --> 13:07.021
- There's nothing we can do.
- We have to call off the bet.

13:07.056 --> 13:08.255
We can't, it's too late.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.323
Hey, are you guys okay?

13:09.359 --> 13:12.860
Yeah. Yeah, we sure are, sweetie.

13:12.862 --> 13:15.312
You know what? You have
yourself a great game.

13:15.348 --> 13:18.232
- Have a good one, bro.
- (MUTTERING) Come on. We need to hurry.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.167
(BOTH MUTTERING)

13:22.271 --> 13:25.206
- Hey.
- So, is it done? Am I a free man?

13:25.208 --> 13:31.011
Yes, you are, because you
live in America. Yay!

13:32.065 --> 13:34.115
- You didn't do it, did you?
- I couldn't.

13:34.150 --> 13:37.935
She's so nice. Did you know
she's the reason I'm a lawyer?

13:37.970 --> 13:40.020
Riley, come on, I was counting on you.

13:40.056 --> 13:41.939
How'd it go with Ross?

13:41.974 --> 13:43.357
He's going to ask you to move in.

13:45.630 --> 13:47.850
So late. See you guys
in the game tonight.

13:48.026 --> 13:49.544
Wish me luck.

13:49.638 --> 13:52.739
Oh my God! How did this get in here?

13:52.791 --> 13:56.660
Right when I stop thinking about Riley,
there she is, messing with my head.

13:56.695 --> 13:59.429
Oh no. Man, see... that ain't right.

13:59.431 --> 14:01.531
That... She's a terrible person.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.550
Anyway, man, just... Whatever.

14:03.602 --> 14:06.453
Don't let this bother you and
make you play horribly, right?

14:06.488 --> 14:08.388
Have a great Riley.

14:08.423 --> 14:10.340
- What'd you say?
- I said, have a great game, man.

14:10.342 --> 14:11.758
Come on, get out of your head.

14:11.793 --> 14:14.377
Just go out there and
focus on the Riley.

14:18.367 --> 14:20.350
Hey, Danny's taken care of.
How's Gustav?

14:20.385 --> 14:21.718
(WHISPERS) I got it covered.

14:23.722 --> 14:25.805
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) What happened
to Barry, my regular driver?

14:25.841 --> 14:28.675
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT) Oh,
Barry is very sick.

14:28.727 --> 14:32.579
But you're in good hands with Bonitza.

14:32.614 --> 14:35.599
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

14:35.601 --> 14:37.450
Of course. Madison, yes?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.502
Yeah, Madison Square Garden.

14:39.504 --> 14:43.823
Oh, I thought you want
Madison, Wisconsin.

14:43.859 --> 14:45.775
What? I miss game.

14:45.811 --> 14:46.760
Don't... Don't worry.

14:46.795 --> 14:48.778
There is turnaround in 20 miles.

14:48.814 --> 14:52.849
To pass time, we could play
I Spy with My Little Eye.

14:52.884 --> 14:54.818
Okay. Uh...

14:54.853 --> 14:57.554
I spy something purple.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.706
Where?

14:59.758 --> 15:02.559
Well, it is gone now.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.464
So no matter how uncomfortable
this is, we have to do it.

15:07.499 --> 15:09.449
We're in a public place, so
neither of them can make a scene.

15:09.484 --> 15:12.402
You're right. Nothing to be scared of.

15:12.437 --> 15:14.454
- God, I'm so scared.
- Me to.

15:14.489 --> 15:16.473
We're the best thing that's
ever happened to them.

15:16.508 --> 15:18.358
Excuse me.

15:18.393 --> 15:20.327
I think we got everything you wanted.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.762
Yeah, except for the popcorn that comes
in a Danny Wheeler collectible tub.

15:22.798 --> 15:26.666
I dropped it by accident, and then
kicked it all over the lobby.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.802
So, here we are.

15:28.837 --> 15:30.687
This is so fun.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.722
You know, I actually thought you
were going to break up with me

15:32.724 --> 15:34.641
since you've been so aloof lately,

15:34.676 --> 15:38.478
but obviously no one would do that at such
a public event. That's just too mean.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.430
Yeah, no. I would never...

15:40.465 --> 15:43.400
Hey, maybe later we can take a
walk somewhere more private?

15:43.435 --> 15:44.534
(WHISTLE TRILLS)

15:44.536 --> 15:48.355
Gosh, I sure hope the Rangers
break their losing streak.

15:48.390 --> 15:50.490
Hey, speaking of taking breaks...

15:50.542 --> 15:52.392
- Oh, my God, that's us.
- Yeah, about us...

15:52.427 --> 15:55.378
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

15:55.414 --> 15:56.846
Who would've done that?

15:56.882 --> 15:58.698
Really?

16:05.824 --> 16:09.476
Jumbotron. Nice touch, Tuck-Tuck.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.512
Yeah, I had to take one for the
team with the Jumbotron girl.

16:12.564 --> 16:15.415
Danny might not be
scoring, but I sure did.

16:16.585 --> 16:18.568
You handle Gustav?

16:18.603 --> 16:21.521
I told him to check a tire
and left him in Jersey.

16:21.556 --> 16:25.375
"Objects in mirror are
angrier than they appear."

16:27.779 --> 16:30.747
Uh, hey, Ben. Do you want to come
with me? I need some mustard.

16:30.749 --> 16:33.767
Of course. There's no way you can
carry all that mustard by yourself.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.573
So, this is an interesting date.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.510
Yeah, if we were dating each other.

16:43.562 --> 16:45.512
They haven't sat still for five minutes.

16:45.547 --> 16:46.696
BOTH: Kids.

16:46.698 --> 16:48.598
(WHISTLE TRILLS)

16:48.633 --> 16:50.517
Jumbotron?

16:50.569 --> 16:52.535
What the hell am I supposed to do now?

16:52.537 --> 16:54.387
What's next? A mixtape?

16:54.423 --> 16:56.573
Are we gonna talk on the phone
for hours like pilgrims?

16:56.608 --> 16:59.342
I just wish there was a simple
reason I could break up with her...

16:59.394 --> 17:03.313
like she's a serial killer and
she insists that we cuddle.

17:03.348 --> 17:04.681
God, what are we gonna do?

17:04.733 --> 17:05.781
No idea.

17:08.336 --> 17:09.769
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.621
We used to do that.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.589
What if Ross and Sarah think

17:13.592 --> 17:14.758
we're actually getting back together?

17:14.760 --> 17:16.659
Is this your way of trying to
get me to make out with you?

17:16.711 --> 17:19.695
Or is this your way of trying
to get me to make out with you?

17:19.731 --> 17:21.664
Of course not. It was your idea.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.433
If you say so.

17:26.538 --> 17:28.438
We have to make sure they can see us

17:28.473 --> 17:29.439
and it has to look real.

17:29.474 --> 17:30.807
Grab your butt. Got it.

17:33.378 --> 17:33.793
Riley...

17:34.846 --> 17:36.429
- Ooh.
- Damn.

17:39.418 --> 17:40.717
Why are those two kissing?

17:40.769 --> 17:43.653
I thought he was dating his teacher

17:43.655 --> 17:44.821
and she was dating Father Time.

17:44.823 --> 17:46.723
Did you have something to do with this?

17:46.758 --> 17:48.658
No, this has nothing to do with me.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.627
Sometimes the gambling
gods just wink at you.

17:52.747 --> 17:54.647
Good job, bro!

17:54.699 --> 17:56.666
Damn it. I don't think they saw us.

17:56.718 --> 17:59.486
Stupid old people with
their bad eyesight.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.504
Oh, oh! Maybe we should try
to get on the Kiss Cam!

18:02.557 --> 18:05.425
Sure, as soon as we kick those two off.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.343
RILEY: What?

18:07.345 --> 18:08.478
Who the hell does Ross think he is?

18:08.530 --> 18:09.779
He's cheating on me?

18:09.781 --> 18:11.414
Riley, we just won the lottery.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.732
Why are you yelling at the ticket?

18:14.453 --> 18:16.419
Sorry it didn't work
out with you and Ross!

18:19.341 --> 18:22.308
Oh, my god. What is Danny doing?

18:22.344 --> 18:23.643
I don't know.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.745
Looks like he finally
realized how to play hockey.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.764
No, no, no!

18:27.799 --> 18:29.682
- (HORN BLARES)
- ANNOUNCER: Goal!

18:29.734 --> 18:30.750
Number 23, Danny Wheeler!

18:30.775 --> 18:32.643
Okay, okay. Hey! Okay,
it's cool, right?

18:32.671 --> 18:35.472
It's fine. Just calm down. Just breathe.

18:35.474 --> 18:36.606
All right? It's still the first period.

18:36.641 --> 18:38.541
So what? He got a lucky goal.

18:38.577 --> 18:40.560
Look, there is no way
that he will score again.

18:40.595 --> 18:42.445
(HORN BLARES)

18:42.481 --> 18:44.547
Danny Wheeler scores again from mid-ice!

18:44.583 --> 18:46.516
- This is all your fault!
- Are you kidding?

18:46.551 --> 18:48.485
Don't you dare pin this on me!
You have a shopping problem!

18:48.537 --> 18:50.503
Yeah? Well, you got a gambling problem!

18:50.539 --> 18:52.388
Oh, wait. Actually, we've
got a bigger problem.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.406
- It's Gustav.
- Oh, snap!

18:53.441 --> 18:55.775
Go! Go, go, go! Oh, my god!

19:01.800 --> 19:03.766
Oh. Uh, hey, Riley.

19:03.802 --> 19:05.702
Oh, don't you "Hey, Riley" me.

19:05.737 --> 19:07.737
Look, you don't deserve this.

19:07.789 --> 19:09.656
I'm sorry. I... I don't
know what happened.

19:09.708 --> 19:12.659
Ms. Gilcrest and I just
felt a connection.

19:12.711 --> 19:13.660
Sarah.

19:13.712 --> 19:16.629
Somebody please call me Sarah!

19:17.749 --> 19:19.666
I am really heartbroken.

19:19.718 --> 19:22.752
I mean, I don't know how I'm
gonna recover from this.

19:22.754 --> 19:25.755
The only thing that might
make me feel better

19:25.757 --> 19:28.675
is if you made me junior partner.

19:28.727 --> 19:29.759
Just think about it.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.646
- Ben, listen, I...
- Save it.

19:33.682 --> 19:35.665
Words are just words.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.333
Kisses are forever.

19:37.369 --> 19:39.319
Except for our kisses. Those are done.

19:44.743 --> 19:46.326
Hold it...

19:46.361 --> 19:47.694
hold it...

19:47.746 --> 19:49.329
and...

19:49.364 --> 19:50.613
We're clear!

19:50.665 --> 19:53.666
Oh, oh, bam!

19:53.702 --> 19:54.617
That worked out nicely.

19:54.669 --> 19:55.702
Should we stay and support Danny?

19:55.754 --> 19:57.620
Why? I mean, he barely
even noticed I was here.

19:58.707 --> 19:59.789
- (HORN BLARES)
- (CHEERING)

19:59.791 --> 20:02.792
Danny Wheeler scores a hat trick!

20:09.148 --> 20:11.098
Awesome win, Danny.

20:11.150 --> 20:12.266
Yeah.

20:12.268 --> 20:14.101
(CHUCKLES)

20:14.496 --> 20:15.495
Yeah.

20:16.499 --> 20:17.999
Appreciate it.

20:18.024 --> 20:19.440
Although, I'm not sure about tomorrow.

20:19.465 --> 20:21.382
Just between us, two of our starters

20:21.407 --> 20:22.356
won't be playing.

20:22.508 --> 20:23.457
Food poisoning.

20:25.195 --> 20:26.680
Really?

20:28.375 --> 20:30.813
Yeah. We're just gonna go somewhere.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.422
Hey, sorry to hear about
the players, man.

20:34.447 --> 20:36.789
Don't be. They're fine.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.664
- Thanks for tipping me off, Emma.
- No problem.

20:40.953 --> 20:44.391
Hey, ah... Did I see you
kissing Riley ealier tonight?

20:44.820 --> 20:46.062
Nope.
