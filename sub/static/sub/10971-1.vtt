made an album in forever,

08:47.240 --> 08:48.366
- right?
- Yeah.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.125

about doing one of my songs.

get out because he suffocates me.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.405
Ditching youth group
for a movie is not the point,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.164
but that little song and dance
that you gave your mother...

13:24.280 --> 13:25.805
Look at me.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.649
That little song and dance
you gave your mother down there

13:28.720 --> 13:30.245
about youth group
was great, uh-huh...

13:30.880 --> 13:33.486
You will not disrespect my wife
like that, not in this house.

13:34.720 --> 13:39.282
These lies, this pattern.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.365
You know it's sin, Grace.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.450
Is that how we raised you?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.401
Is it?

13:49.480 --> 13:51.801
No. No.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.082
You always wanted your
life to be about God.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.764
And these days you're
just all about you.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.922
And I always thought
that we'd be a team,

14:09.440 --> 14:11.329
but if this doesn't stop,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.241
I just don't see how you can
stay in the worship band.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.329
Or be on that album.

14:27.240 --> 14:31.325
ALL: <i>I will bring praise,
I will bring praise</i>

14:31.520 --> 14:35.161
<i>No weapon formed
against Him shall remain</i>

14:35.800 --> 14:39.600
<i>I will rejoice, I will declare</i>

14:40.000 --> 14:44.210
<i>God is my victory
and He is here</i>

14:51.720 --> 14:54.803
<i>This is my prayer in the battle</i>

14:55.880 --> 14:59.009
<i>When triumph
is still on its way</i>

15:00.520 --> 15:04.206
<i>I am a conqueror
and co-heir with Christ</i>

15:04.360 --> 15:07.842
<i>So firm on His promise
I'll stand</i>

15:07.960 --> 15:11.851
<i>I will bring praise,
I will bring praise</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:16.409
<i>No weapon formed
against me shall remain</i>

15:16.600 --> 15:20.321
<i>I will rejoice, I will declare</i>

15:20.800 --> 15:24.282
<i>God is my victory
and He is here</i>

15:28.000 --> 15:32.050
<i>All of my life In every season</i>

15:32.200 --> 15:34.168
<i>You are still God</i>

15:34.400 --> 15:38.200
<i>I have a reason to sing</i>

15:38.680 --> 15:42.446
<i>I have a reason to worship</i>

15:46.120 --> 15:48.566

still pulling his own cables.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.521

15:50.600 --> 15:52.000
- In the flesh, mi amigo.
- (LAUGHS)

15:52.160 --> 15:54.925

Dude, what in the world?

15:55.040 --> 15:57.361
(LAUGHS) Hey, hey!
Let me look at you.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.647
(LAUGHS)

15:58.720 --> 15:59.960
- Man, you got old.
- Yeah.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.485
- (LAUGHS)
- MICHELLE: Mossy?

16:01.600 --> 16:03.045
Michelle! (LAUGHS)

16:03.160 --> 16:04.321
Oh, my gosh! (CHUCKLES)

16:04.520 --> 16:06.807
Oh! Now, she's not aged a day.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.086
Well, I'll have to take
your word for that.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.440
Oh, trust me.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.005
And who is this, if I may?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.206
- JOHNNY: That's Grace.
- Hi.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.327
What? No.

16:13.400 --> 16:14.447
Our daughter.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.607
No, no, no.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.767
(LAUGHS) Yes, yes, yes.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.564
This beautiful woman is baby Grace?

16:18.720 --> 16:20.324
- MICHELLE: Yes.
- (LAUGHS)

16:20.480 --> 16:22.081
How did that happen?
When I saw you last,

16:22.120 --> 16:23.610
you were in diapers.
I'm not kidding.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.802
Grace, this is Frank Mostin.
He was my manager.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.651
He discovered your old
man back in the day.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.609
Pleasure.
You sang beautifully.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.569
Oh, thanks.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.566
You completely got me. Okay, tell
me, what brings you out here?

16:36.720 --> 16:38.404
MOSSY: You remember
Larry Reynolds?

16:38.720 --> 16:40.085
Oh, yeah.
Publicity at MCA.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.651
Well, he's moved up in the world.

16:41.760 --> 16:45.207
Two months ago, they made him
the president of Sapphire Music.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.641
JOHNNY: (LAUGHS) Wow, good for him.
I always liked Larry.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.569
MOSSY: He runs the whole
company now, yeah,

16:49.640 --> 16:52.450
so I went by and paid my old
friend a visit, kissed the ring.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.887
And the first thing he
wants to talk about

16:55.000 --> 16:57.367
is the Australian American Idol kid

16:57.440 --> 16:58.521
who sang the song.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.807
You don't...

17:03.040 --> 17:04.690
How do you not know about this?

17:05.280 --> 17:06.486
(CHUCKLES)

17:07.040 --> 17:09.884
Foolish me, assuming there's
Wi-Fi in the South.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.400
- (JOHNNY AND MICHELLE CHUCKLE)
- Uh...

17:11.440 --> 17:12.851
A couple of weeks ago,

17:13.079 --> 17:14.969
a young kid wins the Australian

17:15.079 --> 17:18.289
<i>American Idol</i>
show singing <i>Misunderstood.</i>

17:18.640 --> 17:20.563
- MICHELLE: You're kidding!
- (JOHNNY LAUGHS)

17:20.640 --> 17:23.883
- Yeah, and the video goes viral.
- What video?

17:23.960 --> 17:27.406
Your video of you at the Greek,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.369
singing the song a
hundred years ago.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.646
(LAUGHS) Wow.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.240
MOSSY: How did you not
hear about this?

17:32.320 --> 17:34.049
JOHNNY: That's the thing
Bill was talking about.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.202
MOSSY: Okay, good, you
scared me there for a moment.

17:36.280 --> 17:41.127
Anyways, so Larry and I,
uh, you know, dinner becomes drinks,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.249
before the sun comes up, I've got
an office at Sapphire Music.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.601
Oh, that's great.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.886
Wow. Congratulations.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.365
It's nice when friends
help out friends.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.522
So anyways,
the best part of the whole thing,

17:50.600 --> 17:52.329
and what brings me here today,

17:52.480 --> 17:54.209
is that although Larry and I have

17:54.320 --> 17:56.084
not quite hammered
out all the details,

17:56.160 --> 17:58.003
Sapphire is ready to
offer you a deal.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.247
Mmm-hmm.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.608
It's a one-off for now,
but I got Larry to agree, in advance,

18:02.720 --> 18:05.883
to a full domestic tour
in support of a new album.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.641
As far as the songs, hands off.
All right?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.562
(EXHALES)

18:09.640 --> 18:12.689
You can do whatever you want. I mean,
not the religious stuff, of course,

18:12.880 --> 18:15.850
but as long as you sing
<i>Misunderstood</i> at every gig on tour,

18:15.920 --> 18:20.050
Larry said, really, the album
is completely up to you.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.165
- Wow.
- Huh?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.242
That is, uh, humbling.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.646
Humbling?
It's huge!

18:26.120 --> 18:27.451
Do I have to point out,
they don't make

18:27.520 --> 18:28.681
offers like this anymore
to guys like us?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.046
(LAUGHS)

18:30.520 --> 18:32.284
- Johnny, we're back!
- (CHUCKLES)

18:32.360 --> 18:34.931
It sounds like an
incredible opportunity.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.364
Oh, it is. And you're welcome.
I worked real hard on it.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.647
(CHUCKLES) I'm sure you did, man.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.530
I'm sure.
And, uh, I really appreciate it.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.561
But, uh, I'm gonna
have to pass, man.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.247
(STAMMERS)

18:49.320 --> 18:50.526
You're messing with me.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.523
No, that's just not
my thing anymore.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.768
Not your thing anymore?
I don't understand.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.524
You're looking healthy and great,

18:56.640 --> 18:58.244
you've got your life back together.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.960
I love what we're doing here.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.806
You do?

19:04.080 --> 19:05.081
Listen.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.090
May I speak freely?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.841
Absolutely. You can say
whatever you want here.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.084
You remember the airport bars?

19:15.320 --> 19:16.810
The coffee house open mics?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.090
Who gave you your shot?

19:19.160 --> 19:20.446
We had a good run, man.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.805
Yeah.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.845
Passed out drunk onstage,
waking up in county?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.611
You remember that, too?
And who was there for you?

19:32.680 --> 19:36.048
You. You did a ton for me.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.929
That's why I gave
you my publishing.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.445
And I would love
to help you out here, Mossy...

19:39.520 --> 19:41.440
Fine, then just say,
"Yes, and thank you, Mossy."

19:42.080 --> 19:44.162
All right.
(CHUCKLES) Um...

19:44.480 --> 19:47.563
- If <i>Misunderstood</i> is all hot again...
- Honey, come on, come in here.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.490
Just do a remake. You own it.
Get the kid from the <i>Idol...</i>

19:50.560 --> 19:52.050
Nobody wants the kid.
Larry wants you.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.929
I want you.
Everybody wants you.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.770
I am sorry, Moss.

20:03.600 --> 20:08.049
Just seeing him again
brings me back.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.520
Me too.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.605
He'll be all right.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.170
- He's a survivor.
- (CHUCKLES)

20:21.400 --> 20:22.686
He'll be fine.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.487
(SIGHS) I just haven't
thought about it in so long.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.161
What?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.486
The past.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.729
How I shouldn't even be here.

20:39.920 --> 20:42.002
The drugs alone should
have killed me.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.126
Mmm.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.888
I'm just glad that life's over.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.247
Then after the guy leaves, right,

20:55.320 --> 20:57.084
my dad launches into this, like,

20:57.160 --> 21:00.004
10-hour speech on
motives and temptation,

21:00.080 --> 21:02.321
and how that world was
so empty for him.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.686
And everyone has a
different calling,

21:03.760 --> 21:05.888
and now he's so fulfilled
and everything.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.530
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing!

21:07.640 --> 21:09.210
I've heard it a million times.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.210
He said it at every church we
ever played at. I'm serious.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.725
He acts like I've never
heard it before.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.524
Yeah, but I mean, it
is pretty cool that

21:15.600 --> 21:17.682
your dad's song is
getting so many hits.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.170
What difference does it make?
He turned him down.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.371
He told the guy if <i>Misunderstood</i>
is that hot right now,

21:24.440 --> 21:26.120
he should get someone
else and do a remake.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.801
What'd the guy say?

21:45.360 --> 21:46.486
(INAUDIBLE)

22:16.640 --> 22:17.971
JOHNNY:
I choose the music very specifically.

(TIRES SCREECH)

22:19.600 --> 22:21.807
GRACE: Fine, it's your music.
And whenever I do

22:21.880 --> 22:23.166
anything different, it's wrong.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.004
Grace, that is not the
point and you know it!

22:25.080 --> 22:27.082
You don't leave the piano
in the middle of a song!

22:27.160 --> 22:28.366
Dad, I don't feel it on piano!

22:28.480 --> 22:29.641
I don't care how you feel!

22:29.760 --> 22:32.286
If I wanted you on guitar,
I would have put you on the guitar!

22:32.440 --> 22:33.601
But that was not how
we rehearsed it,

22:33.720 --> 22:34.846
and that's not your call to make!

22:34.960 --> 22:37.721
Do you know how much better it was
than the boring thing we rehearsed?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.240
- And everybody loved it!
- Grace, your father's right.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.560
It was not your call to make.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.051
I know. I know, Morn.
He's said it a hundred times.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.326
Maybe you should just
start listening!

22:44.440 --> 22:45.680
(YELLING)
That's all I ever do is listen!

22:45.840 --> 22:47.126
And you will not
talk to me that way!

22:47.280 --> 22:48.930
I am the authority here.
Not you!

22:49.000 --> 22:50.206
Oh, you're the authority?

22:50.280 --> 22:52.921
You're also the one who used to get
wasted and went to jail for it!

22:58.040 --> 22:59.451
You're done.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.090
You're out of the band
and you can forget the album.

to be on your stupid album!

A dad who has a hit song, I get it.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.406
No, you have me.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.760
A daughter singing her dad's hit,
that's our angle,

26:18.840 --> 26:21.207
but if you're willing to
work really hard

26:21.320 --> 26:23.766
and do exactly what I tell you,

26:23.920 --> 26:25.445
I'll get you your shot.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.281
Who's your favorite artist?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.446
Probably Renae Taylor.

26:31.520 --> 26:32.885
Yeah, I see a little Renae in you.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.603
If things go well,
maybe you'll open up for her.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.926
No way.

26:37.080 --> 26:39.000
If things go really well,
she'll open up for you.

26:39.040 --> 26:41.122

26:41.200 --> 26:42.611
It wasn't that long ago
that Justin Bieber

26:42.680 --> 26:44.205
was opening up for
Taylor Swift.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.170
I'm just saying, it happens.

26:46.280 --> 26:49.921

they're not religious, right?

26:50.360 --> 26:51.486

26:53.520 --> 26:55.204
- I mean, I write.
- Right.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.124
You know, I write songs.
I think they're good, too, I just...

26:59.600 --> 27:01.841
I don't think they're necessarily
ready to record yet, you know?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.081
Oh, don't worry about that.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.650
I mean, I'll push for an album,

27:04.720 --> 27:06.290
but it won't happen for a while.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.369
- Okay.
- Any questions?

27:09.160 --> 27:10.241
Mmm-mmm.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.403
Oh, wait. Actually, yeah,
I do have one.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.767

27:19.640 --> 27:21.404
This is mine?

27:21.480 --> 27:23.289
Yes. For now.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.961

27:26.120 --> 27:27.320
Oh, it's all about delivering.

27:27.400 --> 27:31.007

27:41.120 --> 27:42.770

27:43.120 --> 27:45.930
No. None at all.

27:51.840 --> 27:55.970

I guess however long it takes.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.841
That's neat.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.686
"That's neat"?

27:59.800 --> 28:02.007
<i>I mean, yeah. What do you
want me to say, Grace?</i>

28:02.480 --> 28:05.927
You've always been amazing.
I didn't expect it to happen like this.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.411
- Like what?
<i>- Like this.</i>

28:07.480 --> 28:09.130
Are you even gonna
call your parents?

28:09.200 --> 28:12.090

in with them and be the

and you know it.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.401
<i>What's wrong?</i>

29:24.480 --> 29:27.290
My only kid, Moss, and you just
rip her right from under me.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.169
Settle down. No...

29:31.680 --> 29:34.411
First of all, I'm taking a
chance on her, okay?

29:34.560 --> 29:37.404
<i>And secondly,
I came to you, remember?</i>

29:37.520 --> 29:39.568
And you kicked me to
the curb yet again.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.449
I honored every agreement
we ever had.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.289
This has nothing to
do with that!

29:43.400 --> 29:47.291
I poured my life into you. Even when
you fell apart, I stuck by you.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.050
And I gave you my publishing!

29:49.160 --> 29:50.400
I never asked for that!

29:50.520 --> 29:54.047
What I did ask for,
after 20 years, was one favor.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.487
And you said no.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.121
How can you do this, man?

29:59.200 --> 30:00.281
<i>Do what?</i>

30:00.440 --> 30:03.887
Your adult daughter came to me.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.010
What do you mean she came to you?

30:07.320 --> 30:10.608
Yeah, she didn't tell you
because she knew you would lose it.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.603
<i>So when you turned me down,</i>

30:12.680 --> 30:15.160

30:49.680 --> 30:50.920

30:51.040 --> 30:52.361
What does it look like I'm doing?

30:52.680 --> 30:54.569
You honestly think she's
gonna listen to you?

30:54.720 --> 30:55.926
I'm not going there to talk.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.961
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna drag her back home?

30:59.000 --> 31:00.126
Yeah, I might.

31:04.240 --> 31:05.287
Johnny, would you stop?

31:05.360 --> 31:06.361
I don't get you!

31:06.520 --> 31:07.965
Are you okay with what she's done?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.485
Of course I'm not okay with it!

31:09.600 --> 31:11.523
But she's 18 years old!

31:11.960 --> 31:13.689
And maybe if you hadn't
been so hard on her,

31:13.760 --> 31:14.761
she wouldn't have left!

Were you watching me, Dad?

38:17.280 --> 38:18.770
I mean, like, really watching me?

38:18.840 --> 38:20.922
No one has ever
questioned your ability.

38:21.000 --> 38:21.808
(SCOFFS)

38:21.880 --> 38:25.601
This is not about the music, it's about
everything else that goes with it.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.886
(EXHALES)

38:28.000 --> 38:29.889
Honey, just come home with me.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.802
Johnny.
I didn't know you were here.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.928
I would have had the band
announce you from stage.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.124
Hey, man.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.684
Dad, did you really
come all this way

38:41.840 --> 38:43.490
just to tell me I'm wrong again?

38:43.920 --> 38:46.764
No. (CHUCKLES)
Of course not.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.407
Can we just go somewhere?
Let's go and talk.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.566
No.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.682
This is what I want.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.767
I don't care what you think.
Tell Mom I love her.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.367
She's really amazing, Johnny.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.360
If you hurt my daughter...

39:18.720 --> 39:19.960
It's me.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.044
Okay?

39:22.600 --> 39:27.447
I'm truly sorry that this is
painful for you. I really am.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.201
Let me know if you need anything

39:32.280 --> 39:33.645
while you're in town.
All right?

- Champagne?
- Yes, thank you.

39:56.960 --> 40:00.009
So I have a lot of respect for your dad.
He has conviction.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.449
And you bring a fresh, young new
sound to his music. It's terrific.

40:03.520 --> 40:04.806
Champagne?

40:04.960 --> 40:06.240
- (CHUCKLES)
- Well, champagne...

40:06.280 --> 40:07.281
MOSSY:
Nice timing.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.489
To, um, the success of
<i>Misunderstood</i>.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.561
- MOSSY: Perfect.
- Cool.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.524
Speaking of which, you got a
timeframe for the album?

40:16.640 --> 40:20.281
Um, no, not yet. I think we'll record
the single, see how that does,

40:20.360 --> 40:23.011
and if it goes well,
we'll shoot a video.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.766
Fair enough. How about a follow-up song?
Maybe something original?

40:27.160 --> 40:29.401
Yeah, well, I think we wanna see
how the reaction to the single is,

40:29.480 --> 40:32.609
then do a radio tour, and,
uh, if all goes well,

40:32.680 --> 40:34.842
we definitely wanna have
a follow-up in place.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.126
Absolutely.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.887
Would you be able to record
an original demo for us?

40:41.080 --> 40:43.526
Maybe something that
you've written?

40:44.120 --> 40:45.281
Yeah, no problem.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.567
Good.
I can't promise anything.

40:48.080 --> 40:49.081
It's all about the numbers.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.446
- MOSSY: Always is.
- Mmm-hmm.

40:50.520 --> 40:54.161
Well, well, well. Frank Mostin.
Haven't seen you for a while.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.810
Kendra. How are you?

40:56.520 --> 40:58.045
Very well, thank you.

40:58.120 --> 41:00.282
Kendra Burrows, meet Grace.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.289
Kendra is with Artist Development.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.601
She will be your image maker.

41:05.880 --> 41:06.458
Hi.

41:06.484 --> 41:08.795
Your photos do not
do you justice at all,

41:08.840 --> 41:10.171
you are stunning.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.561
Thank you.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.724
Grace Trey.
You ever go by Gracie?

41:15.320 --> 41:16.367
Sometimes, yeah.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.522
Gracie Trey, it sounds better.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.084
Yes, it does.

41:21.600 --> 41:22.726

much fun with you.

41:31.480 --> 41:32.481
I can hardly wait.

41:33.440 --> 41:34.566
I got a little something for you.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.886
What?

41:35.960 --> 41:37.166
- Here you go.
- What is it?

41:37.240 --> 41:39.368
Don't open it here.
It's your first advance.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.726
- What?
- Yeah, settle down.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.165
It's gonna be enough
to get you a car

41:42.240 --> 41:43.526
and get you by for a little while.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.520
As long as you avoid
Rodeo Drive, you'll be fine.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.686
What's that?

41:46.800 --> 41:47.926
Perfect.

The, uh, radio play
is good, it's just

44:04.040 --> 44:05.720
that downloads are a
little flat this week.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.761
<i>It happens, don't worry.</i>

44:07.080 --> 44:09.162
Yeah, yeah.

44:09.240 --> 44:11.004
You just worry about
your follow-up song.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.560
When are we gonna hear it,
by the way?

44:12.920 --> 44:15.366
Um, it's almost done. I want to
make sure it's perfect, that's all.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.130

wearing anything.

What's to know?
He's taken Renae's next cover.

44:39.880 --> 44:42.201
Look, Grace, I know you don't
like to think about this,

44:42.280 --> 44:43.611
but you're a beautiful girl.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.006
We just want to make the
most of it, that's all.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.684
And by the way,
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.489
I got a call from Jay
Grayson's manager.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.721
He wants to take you out.

44:50.720 --> 44:52.006
What?

44:52.080 --> 44:53.921
Yeah, apparently when you met,
you charmed him.

Are you kidding me?

- Who are you?

45:40.560 --> 45:41.561
Who are you? Get out!

(STAMMERS) Sorry. I'm Quentin.
I'm interning with Sapphire.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.482
Kendra, she had me drop
off clothes for your video.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.686
How'd you get in?

45:48.760 --> 45:50.649
Here. They gave me a key.
They weren't sure if you'd be here.

45:50.720 --> 45:52.131
Why didn't anyone call?

45:52.240 --> 45:54.083
I don't know, I don't know.
They totally should have.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.571
And I don't know why it's night.

45:55.680 --> 45:57.011
And I'm sorry,
I don't know why any of this.

45:57.240 --> 45:58.844
They just make me do things.
I'm sorry.

45:59.400 --> 46:01.846
Okay. Uh, sorry.
Anyway...

46:03.680 --> 46:05.170
- You okay?
- Yeah.

46:06.480 --> 46:07.527

46:10.120 --> 46:11.963
This is the last of it. Uh...

46:12.680 --> 46:15.604
I. uh, put the rest in your closet.
I hope that's okay.

46:15.680 --> 46:16.681
- It's fine.
- Okay.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.046
(CHUCKLES)
That's a mango.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.326
What?

You put a mango with
the ruffled cami.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.641
Oh.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.326
They'd probably clash.

Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

46:31.440 --> 46:32.566
Okay.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.272

Blackwell's. Please.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.808
Um, and pineapple juice.
Just a splash of it.

47:49.800 --> 47:50.801
And ice.

47:53.880 --> 47:56.042
(CHUCKLES) That's nice.
I'll do the usual.

47:56.760 --> 47:57.761
You bet.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.489
No, seriously, thank you for
coming to hang out with me.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.370
I've been working so much lately,

48:04.480 --> 48:06.005
and the hours on the show are crazy,

48:06.240 --> 48:08.447
and I don't get to ever get out,

48:09.720 --> 48:10.801
so it's good.

48:11.960 --> 48:16.170
I haven't stopped thinking about
you since I saw you the other day.

Oh, wow.

48:24.000 --> 48:25.331
Now it's just a mock-up, but...

48:25.680 --> 48:28.081
I do love the photo.
It's very provocative.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.970
Yeah, it's a nice photo. I just
thought we agreed that Grace's name

48:31.160 --> 48:32.721
- would be in the headline.
- (CHUCKLES)

48:33.760 --> 48:36.604
For a guy who hasn't had a hit in
a decade, you're awfully pushy.

48:36.960 --> 48:40.851
We laughed a ton, and he was
a gentleman and so sweet.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.004
- And it was just... It was perfect.
- All right, I am officially jealous.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.683
Please, you can get any
guy, Kendra.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.649
It's getting the right one
that's the problem.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.529
So, when are you going
to see him again?

48:50.680 --> 48:52.170
I don't know.
Should I call him?

48:52.360 --> 48:54.328
- No, absolutely not.
- Okay.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.257
You let him call you.
You're Gracie Trey.

48:56.283 --> 48:56.746
Yeah.

48:57.320 --> 49:00.881
Yes, I am. Yeah, I'm Gracie Trey.
That's right.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.365
Can I go to the bathroom?
I have to pee.

49:03.520 --> 49:06.091
Of course you can. Hey, even
Sally Benson can wait for you.

49:07.600 --> 49:08.965
Sally, hi.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.567
I read your blog for years.
I knew we'd meet eventually.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.485
Sally, I'm sorry, um...

49:13.560 --> 49:15.369
- Whoa!
- What are you doing in there?

49:18.720 --> 49:22.202
It's the men's room.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.483
- Sorry.
- Is this gonna be a pattern?

49:24.680 --> 49:25.681
Huh?

49:25.760 --> 49:27.364
Oh, no, I mean, uh,

49:27.960 --> 49:30.201
us bumping into each other, not...

49:30.880 --> 49:33.326
Never mind. (CHUCKLES)
So, you liking it?

49:33.400 --> 49:34.606
What?

49:35.400 --> 49:39.166
L.A. I mean, the life.
The whole scene.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.084
I was born for this.

49:43.080 --> 49:44.241
Cool.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.402
(STAMMERS) You know, I was
actually kind of surprised

49:46.520 --> 49:48.568
when I heard you
signed with Sapphire.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.321
Why?

49:50.400 --> 49:51.731
Oh, no, no, nothing bad.

49:51.840 --> 49:53.285
No, I just...

49:53.440 --> 49:57.570
You and your dad played at our
church a couple years ago.

49:58.520 --> 50:01.729
Yeah, we were living in Florida
at the time, my family and I.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.321
Yeah. Um...

50:03.800 --> 50:05.325
I mean, I guess
I just sort of assumed

50:05.400 --> 50:08.165
you'd still be doing
that sort of thing.

50:08.240 --> 50:09.480
I mean, listen,
don't get me wrong,

50:09.560 --> 50:10.686
I think it rocks that you're here.

50:10.760 --> 50:12.922
You know, we definitely
need light in the industry.

50:14.080 --> 50:15.241
Yeah.

50:16.120 --> 50:19.841
I like it. Yeah. And it's
actually a better finish for Jay.

50:20.160 --> 50:21.844
Okay, let's move on.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.132
Uh, let's talk about
your dad for a minute.

50:23.158 --> 50:23.515
Mmm-hmm.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.562
We all know he gave up his
career for religion.

50:25.640 --> 50:28.120
So, uh, what's he doing these days?

50:29.760 --> 50:32.047
My dad's a full-time music
pastor now at our...

50:32.120 --> 50:33.121
At his church.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.647
So I imagine he brought
you up religious.

50:36.160 --> 50:38.003
- How has that affected you as an artist?
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)

50:38.080 --> 50:39.445
Come on in.

50:40.760 --> 50:41.841
(SIGHS)

50:41.960 --> 50:43.200
Hi. Sorry for the interruption.

50:43.280 --> 50:45.328
These are for Grace.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.284
Oh, they're not, uh, from me.
(CHUCKLES)

50:48.040 --> 50:49.565
Wow.
Those are beautiful.

50:49.800 --> 50:51.450
Stick around, she might need you.

50:51.520 --> 50:53.602
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna check who it's from.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.244
Who's the secret admirer?

51:01.240 --> 51:02.480
They're from Jay.

51:02.600 --> 51:03.840
(LAUGHS)
Of course they are.

51:03.920 --> 51:04.921
That rascal.

51:05.040 --> 51:08.203
That is priceless,
but the readers will love it.

51:08.680 --> 51:11.331
So where were we?
Oh, right, your dad.

51:11.800 --> 51:14.087
How has his religion affected you?

51:14.640 --> 51:16.165
Yeah. Um...

51:19.320 --> 51:20.924
Well, he's...

51:21.000 --> 51:23.128
He takes his faith
really seriously.

51:24.080 --> 51:25.127
And, um...

51:26.680 --> 51:29.604
He's all about God and stuff,
you know, which is awesome.

51:32.480 --> 51:35.086
And he is really happy
that I'm here,

51:35.360 --> 51:37.761
you know, doing what I'm doing.
It's exciting, you know?

51:37.840 --> 51:39.410
He's happy for me.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.002
JAY: And I'm gonna get you
a fresh one of these.

51:45.520 --> 51:46.681
Thanks.

51:46.960 --> 51:48.371
Um... (CHUCKLES)

51:48.720 --> 51:50.802
You know what's crazy
and very scary?

51:51.680 --> 51:52.761
Well,

51:53.400 --> 51:54.765
you can't tell anyone, though.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.691
- But there's a...
- (LAUGHS)

51:57.800 --> 51:59.882
- Are you laughing at me?
- I'm not laughing. Sorry, go ahead.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.201
<i>Misunderstood.</i>

52:01.280 --> 52:02.486
There's, like, this follow-up
song that happens

52:02.560 --> 52:03.641
if <i>Misunderstood</i>
does good and everything,

52:03.720 --> 52:04.687
Mmm-hmm.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.001
And I'm supposed to write it,

52:07.080 --> 52:09.526
but I haven't written a song in my life.
(LAUGHING)

52:10.200 --> 52:11.281
- I haven't.
- (LAUGHS)

52:13.040 --> 52:15.884
Not anything good, you know?
I don't...

52:16.040 --> 52:18.040
You could just use another
one of your dad's songs.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.645
- No.
- I mean, what's wrong with your dad?

52:19.720 --> 52:22.326
- JAY: Thank you.
- What is not wrong with my dad?

52:22.400 --> 52:25.324
He hates what I'm doing.
Thank you.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.085
- He hates this?
- Mmm-hmm.

52:27.480 --> 52:31.405
Mmm, not, like, what I'm doing,
but how I'm doing it.

52:31.960 --> 52:32.961
Mmm.

52:33.080 --> 52:34.280
(STAMMERING)
Just how I'm here.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.330
It's my life. You know?

52:37.440 --> 52:38.487
Mmm-hmm.

52:38.720 --> 52:42.406
And his baby girl is not
a baby anymore.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.770
I don't know,
in his mind, I've, like,

52:45.760 --> 52:48.161
totally turned away
from him and God and stuff.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.521
But I haven't.

52:52.600 --> 52:54.841
You know, I haven't. I just, um...

52:58.520 --> 53:02.491
Maybe I just wasn't into the whole
God thing as much as he thought.

53:02.560 --> 53:03.766
Mmm-hmm.

53:07.600 --> 53:08.681
I'm sorry.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.205
Come on, it's all good.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.444
I wanna hear everything
you have to say.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.970
So why don't we get out of here

53:18.360 --> 53:19.885
and go to my place?

53:20.840 --> 53:22.285
You can tell me everything.

53:23.560 --> 53:24.800
Oh...

53:26.080 --> 53:27.445
(CHUCKLES)

53:27.720 --> 53:29.643
(CLEARS THROAT) I shouldn't.

53:30.440 --> 53:32.602
- I really shouldn't. I have...
- You should.

53:32.680 --> 53:35.763
I can't, though. I have to
get up really early tomorrow.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.571
I should probably just go home.
I should.

53:40.360 --> 53:41.850
That's fine. All right.

53:51.320 --> 53:53.209
Johnny still blames himself.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.165
I wish I could encourage him.

53:58.560 --> 53:59.891
I'm sure you do.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.166
No, I don't.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.321
(SIGHS)

54:05.720 --> 54:07.245
I just make it worse.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.285
I miss her, too.

54:15.680 --> 54:18.160
Lately, I think I miss him more.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.690
Days are easier.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.726
Probably 'cause I don't have
so much time to think. (SIGHS)

54:28.400 --> 54:29.606
But nights,

54:30.680 --> 54:31.966
some nights are tough.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.600
Sure.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.880
But you can't let this
paralyze you, John.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.320
I believe God has a lot more
work for you to do.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.930
Even beyond our church.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.411
I'm trying, man.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.240
But when I think about her

54:45.200 --> 54:46.440
and everything that's out there

54:46.480 --> 54:47.720
that she could be getting into.

54:48.880 --> 54:50.291
Maybe she already has.

54:52.520 --> 54:55.364
God may not be using you
in Grace's life right now...

54:55.560 --> 54:56.641
(CHUCKLES BITTERLY)

54:57.000 --> 54:58.161
And He may never.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.130
But He is in control.

55:06.640 --> 55:08.404
Sometimes,
when our kids grow up,

55:09.560 --> 55:11.403
the best thing we can
do is just be faithful

55:11.920 --> 55:13.570
and trust Him to take care of them.

55:18.080 --> 55:20.082
- Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.
- Mmm, what?

55:20.240 --> 55:21.969
Come on, rise and shine.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.122
- What time is it?
- 10:00.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.408
- Must have been a fun night.
- (GROANS)

55:26.560 --> 55:30.246
But I'm determined to finish today,
so you, out of bed.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.845
Okay.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.405
Come on, Gracie Trey.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.201
(GROANS)

55:35.280 --> 55:36.770
<i>KENDRA:
People need to see you.</i>

55:36.840 --> 55:39.320
When they see you, then
they're going to buy you.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.886
Which is why we need you
looking hot for this video.

55:42.600 --> 55:45.809
Well, that and a certain
young actor.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.927
(CHUCKLES)

55:47.360 --> 55:50.523
All right, that's it, I'm done.
I'm happy.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.285
We're gonna leave the boxes. The
intern's gonna bring them to the shoot.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.289
Okay. Hey, um,

55:55.440 --> 55:57.761
can you actually not give
him a key this time?

55:58.120 --> 55:59.326
It's just standard, baby.

56:00.120 --> 56:01.121
Here.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.446
- What is this?
- Just a little something from me to you.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.203
- Open it.
- (CHUCKLES)

56:11.120 --> 56:13.407
It's more for Jay, but...

56:14.680 --> 56:16.284
Isn't it gorgeous?

56:16.480 --> 56:17.481
(CHUCKLES) Um...

56:18.400 --> 56:19.970
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
It's...

56:21.080 --> 56:22.081
Um...

56:22.160 --> 56:24.128

he's that kind of guy?

Mossy news alert!
This just in...

56:36.920 --> 56:37.648
Huh?

56:37.680 --> 56:39.603
the <i>WideSpin</i> bump
was bigger than expected.

56:40.000 --> 56:41.889
You just got green lit to go
on the radio tour.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.604
Oh, my gosh! Get out!
Are you kidding me?

56:43.680 --> 56:45.887
It gets better.
They wanna do the follow-up song.

56:46.160 --> 56:47.400
Okay.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.160
Yeah. They want to record
before you leave.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.401
- All right.
- You feel that?

56:50.480 --> 56:52.000
- Yeah. Feeling it.
- Bring it onstage!

56:52.040 --> 56:53.201
All right, I'm doing that.
Using it. Thank you.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.123
- (CROWD CHEERING)
- Goodbye.

- Hi.
- QUENTIN: Hey, sorry to bug you.

57:03.720 --> 57:06.200
I just need to bring the clothes
for the video. (CLEARS THROAT)

57:06.400 --> 57:08.402
- Yeah, that's fine. It's all this stuff.
- Okay.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.084
I'll just keep the flies out.

57:10.520 --> 57:11.681
(SIGHS)

57:12.760 --> 57:14.524
Okay. Well,

57:16.000 --> 57:18.924
these are from my mom.
(CHUCKLES)

57:19.680 --> 57:22.490
(CLEARS THROAT) She, well, um,
actually, both my parents

57:22.560 --> 57:24.289
remember you really well
from that, uh, night,

57:24.360 --> 57:25.407
you know, at our church.

57:25.560 --> 57:26.971
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you. Thanks.

57:27.080 --> 57:28.411
She made you those.
(CHUCKLES)

57:32.040 --> 57:33.166
(QUENTIN SIGHS)

57:34.240 --> 57:35.401
What are you up to?

57:36.640 --> 57:38.290
I'm just working on a new song.
(CHUCKLES)

57:38.360 --> 57:40.203
Oh, yeah? That's cool.
How's it coming?

57:40.960 --> 57:42.041
Good.

57:48.280 --> 57:49.281
(CHUCKLES)

57:49.400 --> 57:50.367
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry.
That's not...

57:50.440 --> 57:51.965
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

57:52.280 --> 57:55.409
Kendra got me these by mistake.
It's not going anywhere.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.085
- Yeah, no, it's... I don't...
- Sorry about that.

57:57.400 --> 57:58.640
- Okay.
- Mmm.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.246
You know what? Uh...

58:06.560 --> 58:07.925
I made a promise,

58:08.240 --> 58:10.447
and it's gonna sound so ridiculous

58:10.520 --> 58:12.966
because you don't know me at all,

58:13.040 --> 58:15.361
but, uh, it's my mom.

58:15.600 --> 58:17.568
I don't know, we know
you're new in town and everything,

58:17.760 --> 58:20.206
and if you ever want just,
like, a good

58:20.960 --> 58:22.883
home-cooked meal, you know,

58:22.960 --> 58:25.122
she would love to have you over.
Anytime.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.848
- Aww.
- There. Promise kept. (CHUCKLES)

58:28.240 --> 58:29.605
Okay.

58:30.040 --> 58:31.121
Tell your mom thanks.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.401
For the cookies, too.

58:33.480 --> 58:34.641
- It's nice.
- Yeah,

58:34.760 --> 58:36.205
and honestly,
don't even worry about it,

58:36.280 --> 58:37.770
because I told her that you're,
like, a really big star

58:37.840 --> 58:39.569
and you'd never spend time
with somebody like her, so...

58:39.920 --> 58:41.001
You said that?

58:41.640 --> 58:43.404
(STAMMERING)
No. No, no, I didn't.

58:43.920 --> 58:45.763
- I was... Yeah.
- That was a joke, right?

58:46.160 --> 58:47.650
Sorry.
I was trying to do a thing, but...

58:47.720 --> 58:48.960
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

58:49.200 --> 58:51.043
- Yeah. It worked really well.
- Okay.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.167
It did, you got me.

58:52.280 --> 58:53.327
Yeah. Okay.

58:53.480 --> 58:54.845
- See you over there.
- (LAUGHS)

58:57.200 --> 58:58.611
I'll be praying for your new song.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.641
Thanks.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.284
(SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

59:57.560 --> 59:58.846
Okay, let's cut it.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.441
Sorry.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.011
Don't stop for me.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.761
You're Renae Taylor.

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.046
(LAUGHS) Hi.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:18.050
I've heard a lot about you.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:19.601
Wow.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.881
I love your song.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.486
Thank you.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:27.684
You're a huge reason
why I'm here in L.A.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.728
I'm a really big fan.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.725
That's very kind.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.406
- You're probably wondering why I'm here.
- No.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.808
I mean, I'm just
pumped meeting you.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.450
Uh, he mentioned...
Well, my manager

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.965
mentioned that you might stop by

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.891
and that you were possibly
considering me for an opening act,

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.611
which would be, like, insane.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.842
I'm considering several girls.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.484
Oh, yeah. Totally.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.250
I like to get to know a person

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.921
before I think about
traveling with them.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.166
- Yeah.
- I read your <i>WideSpin</i> spread.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.891
Sally's so convincing,
it's hysterical.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.929
Yeah, yeah, she's cool.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.727
I loved the flowers.
Who's idea was that?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.160
Uh, they were from Jay.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.401
(CHUCKLES)

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.886
You're funny.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.011
Guys like Jay Grayson wouldn't
send their dying mother flowers.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.521
Yeah.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.926
(SIGHING) Well,

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.128
now you just have to beat
them at their own game.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.607
And use them more
than they use you.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:26.891
You'll get there.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.361
Oh.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.726
I appreciate that.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.161
Remember,

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:36.448
your body is the biggest
asset you have.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.040
It's your currency.

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.690
Sometimes you have to spend it.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.967
Yeah.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.729
GRACE: Yeah, I mean, it
was incredible meeting her.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.007
I still am kind of blown away.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.083
She's thinking about me
possibly opening for her.

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:56.969
- That's awesome.
- Yeah, I know.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.407
I mean, she's looking at other people,
too, so I can't get my hopes up.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:01.482
Take that out of your mind.
You would kill it.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.401
Thanks. Yeah, it would be insane.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.244
Um... (CHUCKLES)

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.170
You know,
she said something else

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.406
- that was kind of weird.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.050
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- I can't stop thinking about it.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.645
- Sorry.
- That's fine. Do you want to get that?

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.051
No, no, no, no.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.364
- I do, kind of. Is that okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.327
I do want to talk
about that, though.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.447
Okay.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.125
- So one second.
- Okay.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.726
Yeah.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.769
No, I can't tonight.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.720
JAY: No, she thinks that
you're my manager.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:37.887
Hmm.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.042
No, her manager actually
set the whole thing up.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.046
Scotty owed him a favor,
so he wanted us to hook up,

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.283
get some publicity shots,
which we are,

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.410
and, uh, I said,
"Yeah, whatever, man. She's hot."

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.161
Mmm-mmm.

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.084
No. She believes
anything I tell her.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.606
No, I would've,
but then she got all

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.364
weepy about her dad or something.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.480
But tonight,

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.722
I am sealing the deal.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:08.290
Uh, I will call you after.
I might send you a picture.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.005
Yeah, buddy.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.402
Okay, I gotta bounce.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.931
All right, bye.

(SIGHS)

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.961
Uh...

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.089
So you did set it up, huh?

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.761
Even the flowers?

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.006
Who cares?

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.601
Yes! Because of Jay,
we got <i>WideSpin</i>,

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.969
and because of <i>WideSpin</i>,
we got a 29% bump in downloads!

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.531
And that is why Renae Taylor's

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.409
people are considering
you to open up for her!

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.851
What else do you want?

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.045
I want you to leave

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:49.926
my personal life alone.

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.206
Your personal life?

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:52.722
Yes.

01:03:52.748 --> 01:03:54.234
You're about to go on
your first radio tour.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.129
You've gotta record
a second song before you leave,

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.531
which none of us have heard.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.080
I'm sorry TV Punk
broke your heart,

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.766
but you have to deliver
an original song in one week.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.083
The last thing you need
is a personal life!

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.684

she can gravy train.

on to the next contestant.

one that lied, okay?

Now everyone knows you can't.

- He's good.

to leave your mom and dad

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.365
But it's not like my parents tried
to make me or anything, I mean,

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.885
I'm sure I wouldn't
have if they did.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.844
I, uh, was kind of a punk.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.047
(SIGHS)

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.565
And your dad...

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.087
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.366
I don't know,

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.007
I don't even remember what he said,

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:10.370
but his words shook me.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.564
I can't describe it.
I just went home

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.768
that night, and it was like
my whole world

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.643
was just flipped on its head.

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.570
I had a really nice time.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.005
Thank you for having me.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.724
(GRACE SINGING INDISTINCTLY)

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:36.085
Baby, what are you doing?

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.489
She's incredible, Shel.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:43.761
She's incredible.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.405
Yes, she is.

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.966
(MUSIC STOPS PLAYING)

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.684
No, I mean really.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.765
She's phenomenal.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.090
She had the best teacher.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.010
In every way.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.131
Come here.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.481

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.246
(SOBS)

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.970
She's yours now.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.401
<i>GRACE:
What does that mean?</i>

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.404
It means <i>Misunderstood</i>
just hit Top 20.1

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.721
Wow.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.050
How does this not
make you happy?

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.730
It just makes it official.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.608
I'm a one-hit wonder like my dad.
With his song.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.969
Okay, yes. I spoke to Larry
about that last night.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.646
And given the circumstances,

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.007
he does not wanna
go forward with a follow-up song.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.005
They want a full album.

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.127
(CHUCKLES)

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.169
- What?
- They have writers.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.921
Larry would have brought them in sooner,
but you said you had songs.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:42.487
They're not dropping me?

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.688
You're Top 20.
So you can't write.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.011
Big deal. Britney, Rihanna,
they don't write, they sing.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.165
And that's what you're gonna do.
This is your next hit single.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.563
It's called <i>One Fast Night.</i>
It's fantastic. It's brilliant.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.202
It was written by one of Sapphire's
top guys. He wrote it for Renae,

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.881
but I convinced Larry to give it to you.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.049
You learn this on the road,
all right?

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.531
I'll have the rest of the
songs when you get back.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.931
But you learn this.
You got it?

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.165
(INAUDIBLE)

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.844
Forgive me, but pop star.
That's what I see.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.765
Whatever you did for Gracie,
that's what I want.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.481
Okay.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.010
Hi, Mom, it's me. Um...

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:19.890
I'm just calling you back.
I got your message and, um...

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.561
Uh, text me or something,
let me know that you got this.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.444
I'll see you there.

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:37.050
Hi, babe.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.642

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.766
Thanks for coming.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.161
We just wanted to say hi.
We're gonna go

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.487
give you guys a chance
to catch up.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.810
You know what?
I'm gonna go, urn...

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.769
I'm gonna go with them.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.126
I'll see you after.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:10.524
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.490
Good. I'm good.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.606

of music history,

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.691
- congratulations.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.041
Yeah, you too.

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.647
Mossy treating you okay?

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.362
Mmm-hmm. I guess.
Yeah, he is.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.201
Um...

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.210
I watched your video.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.328
And, um, it made me realize that

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.689
maybe I never gave...

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.848
I never did give you
the credit that I should have.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.486
You

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.086
have been gifted
in ways I can't even describe.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.527
I think somewhere deep down,
I always knew it. And maybe...

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.051
Maybe that's why, in my heart,

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.808
I just never wanted you to grow up.
(CHUCKLES)

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.808
And I never gave you any space,

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.926
(SNIFFLING)

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:56.440

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.246
for me...

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:05.691
Because nothing ever
made me happier

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.365
than playing music with you.

- Yeah.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.602

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.483
do this interview thing.

(INAUDIBLE)

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.970
I just don't like the song.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.963
- It's a hit!
- No, Mossy.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.409
It's a song about a girl manipulating
a guy and a one-night stand.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.480
- Can we pick another one?
- I've picked other ones.

01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:40.841
Eleven other ones that are
all going on the album.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.287
Along with this,
your follow-up single!

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.725
You're not listening.

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:46.165
I'm not singing it!

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.886
You sound just like your father,
and it's pathetic.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.281
It's one song.

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.160
Larry and I had
an interesting chat this morning.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.687
- What?
- He didn't want me to say anything.

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.001
Clearly I need to.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.366
What is it?

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:04.965
I should.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.280
We got it.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.530
You're opening for Renae Taylor.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.160
Yeah. She's going in the
studio next week.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:17.082
They wanna release your album the same
time as hers, right before the tour.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.727
They're already working
on it in Marketing.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.601
- She picked me?
- She picked you.

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.081
So, whatever's going on
inside your head,

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.491
let it go.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.443
I'm opening up for Renae Taylor?

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.683
Yes. Because you are the
next Renae Taylor.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.327
I need you to go
in that studio and nail this album.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.087
And then go on the photo
shoot with Randall

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.164
and be great there, too.
And you know why?

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.045
- Why?
- Because this is why you came out here.

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:50.203
This is what happens when
you do have what it takes.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:52.441
Grace,

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.402
this is what it feels like
when you make it.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.081
Hey.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.246
I can't explain it.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.205
Yeah, but...

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.651
I mean, you don't
have to do anything.

01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.721
No, Quentin,

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.044
I'm opening up for Renae Taylor.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:28.280
Okay, this is huge.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.409
I mean, Mossy's right. This is...

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.089
It's is why I came out here,
you know?

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.526
I should be really happy right now.
I don't...

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.444
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.401
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
I think you do.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.841
No, I don't. That's the problem.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.166
- G race.
- What?

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.884
Why do you want this?

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.849
Why do you want any of this?

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:01.964
Because if you want
it just for yourself,

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.121
there's always gonna
be something missing.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.131
You sound like my dad.

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.605
Grace, he's right.

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:15.725
You could sell

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.681
millions of albums.
You could be bigger than Renae.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.001
That's not what really matters.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.171
Did you read that book?

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.607
Yeah.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.170
(CHUCKLES) Good.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.164
Do you think maybe
it's like he says?

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:40.324
We know it in our heads,
but do we really own it?

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.484
Is Jesus Christ really who
you're living for?

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.847
'Cause I don't think your problems
are just with your dad.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.324
I think maybe you're fighting God.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.841
I mean,

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.010
that was my story.

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.411
So open for Renae, don't open
for her. That's not...

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.210
That's not what's
important right now.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.204
Just stop running.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:16.364
Stop running from God.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.450
Make things right with your dad.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.088
And I promise you, you do that,

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:28.121
I'm pretty sure you're gonna find
what you're looking for.

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:11.522
TIM: And after speaking with her
for some time, I was pleased

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.441
to invite her to join
us this morning.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.564
So please let me welcome

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.290
back to our family

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.370
a very special guest.

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.130
(QUIETLY)
Hi. Thank you.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.880
Thank you, Pastor Tim.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:39.441
Hi.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.081
You probably didn't expect to
see me here this morning.

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.767
Most of you know I didn't exactly
leave on the best of terms.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.248
And I know along the way,
I hurt some of you.

01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:01.682
And for that, I wanted to ask if you
could please forgive me. Please.

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.809
The real issue, it wasn't with you.
It was me. I was the problem.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.081
So this morning

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:13.681
I asked Pastor Tim,
and he said it was fine

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.525
if I could play a song for you that I
wrote. My first song. (CHUCKLES)

<i>I've given this more thought
than you'll ever know,</i>

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:34.528

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:41.162
<i>I hope someday I can explain all my
reasons for doing this, but right now,</i>

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.164

Yeah, I don't know, I mean,

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.369
we want something
small and intimate.

01:33:49.560 --> 01:33:51.801
You know, something special.
What did you and Lauren do?

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:54.964
For our wedding it was the same.
We wanted something small.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.010
And so it was just our friends and
family, all the people closest to you.

01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.650
- Not so much pressure, too.
- Exactly.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.210
Oh, hi, guys.
You talking about me?

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:02.481
Always. (LAUGHS)

Yeah, but, uh,
I have a little bit of news.

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.849
I just got off the phone with Larry.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.641
Third quarter reports
are in, and, uh,

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.407
Sapphire's newest
division is here to stay.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.449
- Oh, my gosh!
- Congratulations.

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.931
- Isn't it amazing?
- That's huge, man.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.160
It's your stellar leadership.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.406
It's your amazing singing,
honey.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.522
- Stop.
- Everybody good?

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:23.726
Yeah, we're good.

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:25.766

- Love you, Rach.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:32.405
Who said you could
hold my daughter's hand?

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.364
- I believe you did, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:36.529
So my boss is gonna
be my son-in-law?

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:38.409
- Afraid so.
- One big, happy family.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.524
- I love you, baby. See you onstage, Dad.
- I love you, sweetie.
