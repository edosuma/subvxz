02:19.889 --> 02:21.890
Thank you all for coming out today.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.602
It really means a lot to us
to have you here.

02:26.312 --> 02:30.023
And I know it would have meant a lot
to my brother as well.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.278
Chris is...

02:34.362 --> 02:36.488
was a naturaI comedian.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.368
And anyone who knew him
has heard his patented jokes.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.747
The setup varied from time to time.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.751
"How many people can you fit in a boat?

02:51.087 --> 02:54.381
"How many people can you fit
in an elevator? A car?"

02:56.009 --> 02:58.677
But the punch line was always the same.

02:58.761 --> 03:03.724
"One, with a big fat head".

03:05.977 --> 03:10.772
He used to tell me that he was getting 'em
from a book that he kept top- secret.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.441
Stashed away.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.737
And just before he passed away,
he called me over to tell me something.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.030
He said,

03:18.114 --> 03:22.117
"Eddie, there wasn't a book
with all the jokes.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.914
"I made them up. I didn't want you
to go try looking for it".

03:38.134 --> 03:40.135
I like your cracker house.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.305
Do I know you?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.474
Does anybody here know you?

03:51.481 --> 03:52.814
Hey, wait.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.903
The suit was a giveaway.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.197
You're not supposed to wear black
to these things anymore.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.949
Why not?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.785
'Cause it's a bummer.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.163
Yeah, people like
to wear bright colors these days.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.291
I don't have any bright colors.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.466
I'm not gonna tell, or whatever,
about crashing the memorial.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.094
Good. Sorry for your loss.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.184
"Cast thy bread upon the waters,

04:29.769 --> 04:32.562
"for thou shalt find it after many days".

04:32.647 --> 04:36.817
I'm reminded of the little squirrel
that Vicki talked about

04:36.901 --> 04:41.446
in a poem that she wrote,
discovered among her papers.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.616
Here's that poem.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.119
"The leaves are turning, turning

04:47.203 --> 04:50.372
"Yellow, orange, red

04:51.874 --> 04:53.292
"The colors of death

04:53.376 --> 04:58.130
"Like the squirrel without its walnut,
without its mother

04:58.214 --> 04:59.423
"I am alone

04:59.507 --> 05:03.885
"Like a deer that longs for running streams
My soul longs for you, my God

05:03.970 --> 05:06.847
"My soul longs for you"

05:06.931 --> 05:10.100
And we must remember the words
from Ecclesiastes as well.

05:10.184 --> 05:15.480
"Cast thy bread upon the waters,
for thou shalt find it after many days.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.192
"If the clouds be full of rain,
then they empty themselves upon the earth.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.988
"And if the tree fall toward the south
or toward the north,

05:23.072 --> 05:24.906
"in the place where the tree falleth"...

05:35.752 --> 05:36.877
It's not that bad.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.506
- C- 8.
- Hit.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.925
What do you mean? I'm ruined.

05:44.302 --> 05:46.845
Thanks to her, they'll probably have people
watching out for me now.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.639
I'm gonna have to be careful.

05:49.724 --> 05:50.766
F- 5.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.311
- Miss.
- Where's your dumb little boat, Hiroshi?

05:54.395 --> 05:57.064
Maybe you should stop going
to strangers' funerals.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.901
C- 6.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.444
Hit.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.947
A- 7?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.743
Miss. C- 9.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.872
How is it you win every time?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.136
So I thought I'd give it a try.

06:29.305 --> 06:32.724
It's not my best color.
It's one of my mom's old dresses.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.353
It's a little big,
but it should be okay, right?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.438
Are you following me?

06:38.523 --> 06:41.316
No, I just thought
I'd find you here.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.734
Well, you did.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.903
- Can I come in with you?
- No.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.658
- Well, why not?
- Because you can't.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.838
I don't need help, okay?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.923
- Why?
- Because there's nothing to help with.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.135
- Well, I can just, like...
- Just leave me alone.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.679
Okay.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.515
I'm Annabel.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.952
- Can I have a word with you?
- Yes.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.887
I'm not quite sure
what your game is here, son,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.639
but this is the fourth funeral
I've seen you at this month.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.975
And either you are
the world's unluckiest boy

07:57.059 --> 07:59.644
or you are a disrespectful
little prankster.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.480
If I see you around here again,
I'm calling the cops,

08:01.564 --> 08:03.773
- and I'm going to tell all the...
- Marcus?

08:03.858 --> 08:05.859
Marcus, I've been looking for you.

08:05.943 --> 08:10.280
I want you to meet my cousin.
I told her alI about you.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.575
Hey. Hey,
thanks for helping with my uncle's funeral.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.120
Yeah, he was a great, great man.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.165
We're just all so torn up about it.

08:20.249 --> 08:23.543
- This is my boyfriend, Marcus.
- Marcus.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.922
- Marcus Daly.
- Nice to meet you, Marcus.

08:27.256 --> 08:30.133
Pleasure's all yours, I'm sure.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.595
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.847
Thank you, sir.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.599
My aunt's taking it really hard right now,

08:37.683 --> 08:40.477
so we're trying not to leave her alone
for too long.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.104
Yeah. Thanks, man.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.941
Come on.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.033
Again.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.537
I'm so sorry for your loss.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.829
You'll get there.

08:59.914 --> 09:00.956
Do another one.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.253
So sorry for your loss. He'll be missed.

09:06.337 --> 09:09.548
Our prayers are with you
in this difficult time.

09:09.632 --> 09:13.176
- Too formal.
- Yeah. I like it, though.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.140
- My name's not Marcus, you know.
- I figured.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.979
I'm not sure why I picked that.
You don't really look like a Marcus.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.105
I'm Enoch.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.815
Much better. I'm Annabel.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.401
But I already told you that.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.325
- So did you know that cancer kid?
- What?

09:37.410 --> 09:38.910
The kid from the other funeral?

09:39.203 --> 09:42.289
Yeah. I volunteer at the hospital.
In the Webber building.

09:42.540 --> 09:43.832
Is that
where all the cancer kids are?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.084
Kids with cancer.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.336
Bummer.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.796
Not really.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.093
What are you reading?

09:55.177 --> 09:57.053
It's a new biography on Darwin.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.513
The evolution guy?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.849
Yeah. He's kind of my favorite.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.019
- Why?
- "Why?"

10:04.645 --> 10:07.272
Well, only because he's the father
of the greatest idea

10:07.356 --> 10:09.608
a human being has ever had.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.985
Not to mention the fact
that he was brilliant enough

10:12.069 --> 10:15.405
to see nature's design
laid out right in front of him.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.825
And maybe just because
he was the most important scientific mind

10:18.909 --> 10:22.078
that ever was or ever will be
in the history of history.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.748
- What about Einstein?
- What about him?

10:25.916 --> 10:27.000
All right.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.715
Well, I'm gonna get home or whatever.

10:34.216 --> 10:36.301
Okay. Yeah, me, too.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.013
Thanks for bailing me out back there.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.640
Yeah. Any time.

10:42.558 --> 10:43.642
Okay.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.905
I don't know why we stilI eat in here.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.161
Did you look at those schooI brochures
I left on your bed?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.454
No.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.167
There's some really great schools
in the city.

11:09.251 --> 11:12.504
And Henderson has this great college
prep course,

11:12.588 --> 11:14.381
and I know the headmaster at...

11:15.174 --> 11:18.009
May I be excused, Mabel?

11:19.136 --> 11:21.971
Why don't you call me
Auntie Mabel anymore?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.935
Okay.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.367
No. With your whole body.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.205
No, that's too far.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.208
Like this?

11:50.292 --> 11:53.545
- No way.
- This feels pretty good.

11:53.629 --> 11:57.090
I'll take a good old- fashioned handshake
any day.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.551
A bow is a sign of deep respect.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.219
So's a handshake.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.139
Come on, try it.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.269
Enoch Brae, nice to meet you.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.481
White people. You have to grab everything.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.027
Okay. You stick with the bow.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.588
Enoch, come away from the edge.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.007
Don't worry.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.718
I'm over that.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.845
Are you?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.389
Yeah. I'm fine.

13:17.254 --> 13:19.964
- What's the score?
- You're up five hits.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.383
I thought it was six.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.136
We didn't count that one.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.846
I did.

13:26.931 --> 13:32.268
Tennessee, St. James and New York
are the best properties on the board.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.606
I like Boardwalk.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.734
Yeah, nobody wins with Boardwalk.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.071
It's a terrible investment
that never pays off.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.657
like Boardwalk.

13:45.741 --> 13:49.410
Fine. I'll trade you orange
for blue any day.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.746
Okay. Deal.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.129
What?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.257
That's her.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.635
- Who?
- That girl I was telling you about.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.638
- Why is she dressed like a boy?
- She's not.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.682
Are you gonna go talk to her?

14:10.766 --> 14:13.268
- What do I say?
- You could say hello.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.605
I'm gonna go talk to her.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.191
Okay. I'll see you at home.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.944
She won't be able to see me anyway.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.154
All right, see you, Hiroshi.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.540
Annabel.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.126
Enoch.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.587
Funny running into you here.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.590
I was just walking.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.636
By myself. You know.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.306
Cool.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.725
I like to come out here to draw.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.519
It's nice, you know, to get out.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.980
Yeah, always good to get out.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.401
Seen any good funerals lately?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.111
Yeah. This one guy,

15:05.321 --> 15:10.283
he had this weird skin disease
that made him go crazy or whatever.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.245
Closed casket.

15:14.788 --> 15:15.997
Of course.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.000
Could I see your drawings?

15:19.335 --> 15:22.170
I'm not very good. I just like to do it.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.300
It's okay.
I can barely draw a stick figure.

15:27.676 --> 15:28.843
Okay.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.807
This is Chroicocephalus ridibundus,
the black- headed gull.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.559
Her head is actually white in the winter

15:36.685 --> 15:39.979
and she has these cool black streaks
on her plumage.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.486
That's the little- footed gull.
That one's not finished.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.239
- And there's...
- Who's this guy?

15:50.991 --> 15:52.367
I really like him.

15:52.534 --> 15:56.496
Nicrophorus americanus,
the American burying beetle.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.499
- I like his little mustache.
- Yeah.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.834
He's pretty amazing.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.795
What makes him so amazing?

16:03.879 --> 16:07.799
Well, they can smell carrion
from miles away,

16:07.883 --> 16:09.425
which is what death smells like.

16:10.886 --> 16:14.305
So basically, a male and female
will show up at the body,

16:14.390 --> 16:16.599
and kind of get to know each other.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.935
Then they work together
to bury the carcass.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.646
And then they mate.
And then she lays her eggs on it.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.106
But they aren't like other species,

16:23.190 --> 16:26.067
like bug species,
that just run away afterwards.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.320
They make
a little chamber nearby, underground.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.072
And then, when the babies hatch,

16:31.198 --> 16:34.450
the parents go chew up the corpse
and feed it to them.

16:34.535 --> 16:38.371
Isn't that amazing?
They actually take care of their kids.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.588
Do you want to meet my parents?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.926
Sure. Okay.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.726
Do you always meet your parents
at a graveyard?

16:59.810 --> 17:01.185
These days.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.609
Mom, Pop,

17:10.904 --> 17:12.488
this is Annabel.

17:14.657 --> 17:17.201
Yeah, yeah, I'm eating.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.538
Why is that always the first thing
you ask me?

17:20.622 --> 17:24.250
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Brae.
I'm Annabel Cotton.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.753
You can call me Annie, if you'd like.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.964
It's nice to meet you, too.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.925
We met at a memorial.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.595
It was for a friend.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.805
I'm fine. Thank you, though.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.728
She works at the hospital with cancer kids.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.313
Kids with cancer.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.647
It's the same thing.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.484
Not the same thing.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.236
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

17:52.321 --> 17:56.741
- How is that not the same thing?
- Yes, I notice. He's very stubborn.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.576
No, I'm not.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.287
He was always that way? Really?

18:01.371 --> 18:02.580
I was not.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.333
I mean, I am not.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.757
Annie here is a bug stalker.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.844
Naturalist. I'm a naturalist.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.434
Like I said, bug stalker.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.021
Well, it's just a little bit more
complicated than that.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.274
Well, it's studying the world
that we live in.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.028
The trees and the grass and bacteria
and mice and birds,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.364
and how they all fit together.

18:38.534 --> 18:41.786
Yeah. I think it's pretty cool, too.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.961
We're gonna go
to the soccer game on Sunday.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.295
We are?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.257
Yeah. Sunday. I almost forgot.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.803
It's at 3:00, behind the elementary school.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.765
Yes, it is. Right behind there.

19:09.857 --> 19:14.193
"That is how to transform
into your true power self.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.321
"By taking responsibility
for your perceptions

19:17.406 --> 19:21.075
"so that you are not
the victim of the events in your life,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.789
"but the events of your life...

19:22.790 --> 19:26.890
"are the creation of what you
perceive them to be.

19:27.666 --> 19:31.752
"This is how you become the god
or goddess

19:31.837 --> 19:34.755
"of your own personal universe".

19:34.840 --> 19:37.383
Mom, that guy is a total hack.

19:37.467 --> 19:40.845
Well, when you read it,
then you can have an opinion.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.432
- I met a boy.
- Really?

19:45.100 --> 19:49.145
Yeah, I met him at Chris' memorial.
He was kind of different.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.731
- Different can be good.
- Yeah, I think it is.

19:52.608 --> 19:56.861
Yeah, well, be careful.
Because boys can be jerks.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.070
All of them?

19:58.155 --> 19:59.530
All the ones I knew.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.948
Bummer.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.450
I want to meet him.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.577
Okay. I'll bring him over.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.122
All right.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.708
Books away, please.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.878
Mom.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.338
Annie.

20:15.422 --> 20:18.216
Don't you listen
to what your sister says, Annie.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.468
You just have fun.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.930
Mom, can you just take it easy
on that, please?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.309
- So, what were you reading?
- Ornithology book.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.229
- What's that?
- Birds.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.272
- For school?
- Nope.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.816
We'll see what Dr. Lee says tomorrow.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.194
You might be able to start again next week.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.570
Okay.

20:42.866 --> 20:45.743
So, anything good in that bird book?

20:45.827 --> 20:46.953
Yeah.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.122
Apparently, there's this kind of songbird

20:50.207 --> 20:52.291
that thinks it dies
every time the sun goes down.

20:53.043 --> 20:57.171
So in the morning, when it wakes up,
it's totally shocked to still be alive,

20:57.256 --> 20:59.966
so it sings this really beautiful song.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.887
Just happy not to be dead, I guess.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.952
So?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.722
I didn't think
it would be back so soon.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.476
I guess that's a no on school.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.480
I mean,
when you think about it geologically,

21:56.565 --> 22:01.360
our lives are just a little speck
on the time line anyway, so...

22:01.445 --> 22:04.113
People haven't even been around
for a fraction of the time

22:04.197 --> 22:05.656
that some reptiles have been around.

22:05.741 --> 22:11.829
So, three months is almost the same
as three centuries or three days,

22:11.913 --> 22:14.123
- or three...
- Annabel, stop. Please.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.500
Can we just... Can we not... Can we...

22:16.918 --> 22:19.086
Can we just not? Okay?

22:25.093 --> 22:26.260
This kid is unbelievable.

22:26.345 --> 22:31.515
He's, like, seven, and he's already got
a shot that could kill a golden retriever.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.726
Come on, Riots!

22:33.810 --> 22:36.020
Do you know one of these kids?

22:36.104 --> 22:38.522
No. Hiroshi and I just like to...

22:38.607 --> 22:40.107
Who's Hiroshi?

22:43.445 --> 22:44.987
He's a friend.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.447
From school?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.158
No.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.079
He's a...

22:53.330 --> 22:55.831
He's sort of a ghost.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.584
- He's a ghost?
- Yeah.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.881
- A Japanese ghost?
- Yeah.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.216
Do you speak Japanese?

23:05.300 --> 23:07.760
- No, he speaks English.
- Really?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.096
Wow.

23:13.266 --> 23:14.892
Can I meet him?

23:14.976 --> 23:17.561
You could try. No one else can.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.730
- Can he fly?
- He used to.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.148
"Used to"?

23:22.442 --> 23:25.319
Well, he was a kamikaze.

23:25.404 --> 23:28.072
Like one of those guys
who crashed into ships and things?

23:28.156 --> 23:29.323
Yeah. One of those guys.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.327
So you're haunted, then.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.206
I guess I am.

23:37.290 --> 23:40.126
I never thought about it like that.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.420
Wonder who I'll get to haunt.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.715
I don't think
I would have been his first choice.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.344
- You can choose?
- I don't think so.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.224
I'll find out in a few months.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.310
Wait, what are you talking about?

23:58.395 --> 23:59.854
I was lying, Enoch.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.940
About working at the hospital.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.317
I don't work there.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.902
I'm a patient.

24:09.239 --> 24:10.948
Wait, at the cancer place?

24:13.743 --> 24:17.037
- And...
- And I just got some tests back.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.915
That bad, huh?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.333
I flunked.

24:24.546 --> 24:28.215
So, how long?

24:28.300 --> 24:29.758
Three months.

24:31.344 --> 24:32.887
So I understand if you don't wanna...

24:32.971 --> 24:36.056
A person can get a lot done
in three months.

24:36.141 --> 24:40.519
- You think?
- Yeah. You could learn French,

24:40.604 --> 24:43.731
go to Africa, pick up the xylophone.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.150
Tons of stuff.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.737
I always wanted to be
a world-renowned xylophone player.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.616
I don't think it takes that long, right?

24:53.700 --> 24:56.577
I don't know,
there are a lot of those bar thingies.

24:58.622 --> 25:01.081
Would you get one for me?

25:01.166 --> 25:02.917
I know a guy.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.968
I could help you get ready, you know?

25:13.053 --> 25:15.846
To learn the xylophone?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.349
No, for...

25:18.433 --> 25:19.767
You know.

25:22.395 --> 25:26.899
I mean, I know a lot about it or whatever,
so I could help you with stuff.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.653
Okay.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.446
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.406
Cool.

25:39.788 --> 25:44.041
Hey, I have a transfusion tomorrow.
Do you want to come see me after?

25:44.125 --> 25:46.502
I love it when girls ask me that.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.755
Shoot.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.924
You're not very good at this.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.968
This game is impossible.

25:59.015 --> 26:02.101
Okay, but that's only
because you play it more.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.854
Does it hurt when they...

26:08.441 --> 26:10.568
Sorry.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.778
It's okay.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.447
They always tell me how brave I am.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.827
After every needle and MRl and test.

26:19.911 --> 26:23.539
Makes me wonder
how the non- brave kids act.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.916
I could take some of them for you.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.335
- My tests?
- Yeah, I'm great at tests.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.964
Used to help all the other kids
at school cheat.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.216
Why aren't you at school?

26:34.301 --> 26:36.594
I'm just not.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.470
- Are you...
- Just not.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.431
Okay.

26:41.850 --> 26:45.269
Sorry I couldn't find that xylophone.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.438
I spent all night
looking for the stupid thing.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.981
It's fine.

26:49.065 --> 26:51.984
I know, but it's just...

26:52.068 --> 26:54.820
When I think of things going a certain way,

26:54.904 --> 26:57.823
and then they don't,

26:57.907 --> 26:59.491
it's difficult.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.161
How's this gonna go?

27:02.704 --> 27:05.331
- "This"?
- You and me.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.375
I don't know.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.961
That's the part
where you say it's gonna go really well.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.762
You're all set, Annabel.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.221
Could I get a couple of those for the road?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.556
No.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.352
Larus novaehollandiae.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.813
"Laughing gull".

27:29.898 --> 27:32.566
Larus atricilla.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.068
"Little gull".

27:34.152 --> 27:35.653
Larus minutus.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.157
Getting better, huh, Charlie?

27:42.827 --> 27:44.411
Still no on the horse.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.955
Why does she keep asking if I ride a horse?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.333
I wonder where ghost horses go.

27:50.585 --> 27:54.338
- What is it with girls and horses?
- I think it's the mane.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.258
Does she want to know
about my military service?

27:58.343 --> 28:00.010
I don't think so.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.929
Don't think what?

28:02.013 --> 28:04.473
He wants to know if you want to know
about his military service.

28:04.766 --> 28:06.016
Of course.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.935
Good. It was 1941.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.729
- I was at the top of my graduating class.
- It's boring.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.690
You used to like that story.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.733
I've heard it a million times.

28:14.818 --> 28:18.237
Top of your class.
Chosen over hundreds of other pilots.

28:18.321 --> 28:21.031
- Does he miss flying?
- I do.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.492
- He says he does.
- Wasn't he scared?

28:24.327 --> 28:27.204
We weren't allowed to be afraid.

28:27.288 --> 28:29.623
- He said a little.
- No, I didn't.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.500
It was implied.

28:32.627 --> 28:36.630
Do you ever get to meet famous ghosts,
like Ben Franklin,

28:36.756 --> 28:39.049
or Napoleon or anything?

28:39.134 --> 28:40.676
We haven't met any other ghosts yet.

28:41.469 --> 28:44.054
Maybe you should take out a personal.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.600
- He says he likes yourjacket.
- No, I didn't.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.603
Thank you, Hiroshi.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.025
He says he thinks you look really nice.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.944
I still don't know
why she's dressed like a boy.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.988
He's very complimentary.

29:02.323 --> 29:04.199
He's a friendly ghost.

29:06.619 --> 29:09.413
- Enoch, we should get back home.
- Why?

29:09.497 --> 29:11.498
- Why what?
- He thinks we should go.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.501
- Am I boring him?
- No.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.711
Tell her no.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.046
He just wants to play Battleship.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.590
So what if I do?

29:19.674 --> 29:21.717
Is he any good?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.343
I haven't beat him yet.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.596
Payback for Nagasaki, huh?

29:28.141 --> 29:30.476
What did she say about Nagasaki?

29:31.186 --> 29:32.436
Nothing.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.938
Nothing what? What'd I say?

30:34.707 --> 30:35.958
Is Annie here?

30:36.042 --> 30:39.962
I'm Elizabeth. I'm Annabel's sister.
You must be Enoch.

30:40.046 --> 30:41.505
Must be.

30:41.589 --> 30:42.923
Come on in.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.513
She around?

30:49.597 --> 30:52.182
Yeah, she's downstairs.
I'll tell her you're here.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.018
Annie! Your boyfriend's here!

30:55.103 --> 30:57.604
Not my boyfriend. I'll be right up.

30:59.607 --> 31:01.525
- Sit down.
- I'm okay.

31:01.609 --> 31:02.985
Have a seat.

31:08.074 --> 31:11.702
So, I hear you two met at a funeral?

31:11.786 --> 31:12.953
Memorial service.

31:13.121 --> 31:15.122
I'm sorry for your loss.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.875
It's okay. I didn't know him or whatever.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.127
- Know who?
- The kid who died.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.216
So how are you two getting around?

31:26.301 --> 31:28.302
We're gonna take the bus.

31:29.137 --> 31:32.097
Nothing like public transportation
to set the mood, right?

31:32.181 --> 31:33.724
"The mood"?

31:33.808 --> 31:37.060
No mood, no mood. Just forget I said it.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.062
So you don't have a car?

31:40.857 --> 31:42.774
No, I don't really care for them.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.026
Why's that?

31:44.611 --> 31:45.777
It's a long story.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.947
Cars are very dangerous.

31:49.032 --> 31:53.702
Annabel tells me you talk to a ghost.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.413
- She told you that?
- She did.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.832
- It's kind of a joke.
- "Kind of"?

31:59.667 --> 32:01.084
I'm a good kid.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.378
Where do you go to school, Enoch?

32:04.714 --> 32:05.756
I sort of don't.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.424
Why is that?

32:07.800 --> 32:11.094
Well, frankly, Elizabeth,
it's kind of another long story.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.389
So, let's just say
it was a misunderstanding.

32:15.683 --> 32:19.019
Okay, so I have this all straight.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.940
You're a funeral- crashing dropout

32:23.024 --> 32:25.567
with no car

32:25.652 --> 32:27.986
and a dead friend.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.406
Sounds pretty not- so- good
when you say it all together like that.

32:34.869 --> 32:35.994
Wow.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.706
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.381
- Hey, Annabel.
- Hey, Laura.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.676
Where are we going?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.386
It's a surprise.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.820
This place is amazing.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.165
I wonder who's in there.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.420
That.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.006
That's Skinny Jimmy Two Socks.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.882
Got hit by a runaway go- cart.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.051
Terrible tragedy.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.305
What about there?

33:38.933 --> 33:42.519
That's Old Lady Wellbether.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.313
She got devoured by a great white shark.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.527
How about that one?

33:50.611 --> 33:52.904
That's a sad one.

33:52.989 --> 33:55.449
That's Nicky "The Richter Scale" Johnson.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.368
Got mauled to death by a wild ape.

34:00.371 --> 34:01.705
Oh, man.

34:01.789 --> 34:03.331
What about there?

34:08.670 --> 34:10.422
Excuse me. Can I help you?

34:10.797 --> 34:12.466
No, we're just browsing. Thanks.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.427
- Hi, I'm Annabel.
- You kids aren't supposed to be in here.

34:15.511 --> 34:20.223
- Hey, my girlfriend was just trying to...
- What? Ian, call security.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.148
Is this some sort of a joke?
Do you bring all your dates here?

34:28.232 --> 34:31.068
No. We were just curious.
What's your problem?

34:31.152 --> 34:34.821
"Curious"? My problem
is you're in my morgue.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.824
Could you show some respect, please?

34:40.161 --> 34:42.245
- Annabel?
- You know these kids?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.873
Just the girl here. She's a Webber kid.

34:44.956 --> 34:47.333
A patient in the Webber building.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.754
She looks pretty happy, right?

34:52.172 --> 34:53.924
Yeah, she does.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.345
- Hey, Joseph.
- Hey, Annie.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.138
You still owe me a Snickers bar.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.891
Yeah. I still think you tricked me, though.

35:02.975 --> 35:05.977
- That was the point.
- I suppose it was.

35:07.188 --> 35:09.189
What do you say you kids go on home now?

35:09.273 --> 35:10.357
Yes, sir.

35:11.901 --> 35:12.984
I'm Annabel.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.362
- Suzette.
- This is Enoch.

35:16.030 --> 35:19.199
"Webber kids," huh?
That's what they call us?

35:19.951 --> 35:22.828
- Sometimes, yeah.
- You must see a lot of us.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.122
- I am sorry, dear.
- It's fine.

35:26.582 --> 35:29.835
- And if it's not fine, it'll be fine.
- Of course.

35:29.919 --> 35:32.212
Come on, Annie. Come on.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.555
Sorry I got so worked up back there.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.306
It's okay.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.142
I thought it was kind of sweet.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.893
- Really?
- Kind of.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.959
I mean, I know you said
I'm not your boyfriend...

35:50.960 --> 35:52.760
or whatever, I just felt like...

36:01.784 --> 36:04.286
I think that's what girlfriends do.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.684
We should have cheeseburgers
and milkshakes.

36:27.768 --> 36:28.852
We are.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.396
- No, I mean, at my memorial.
- Yeah.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.276
And tacos and lo mein and Red Vines.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.862
And pizza and fluffernutters.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.114
And everybody can just really pig out.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.450
I mean, that's what people do
when they're upset anyway, right?

36:45.536 --> 36:46.912
Yeah.

36:46.996 --> 36:49.080
And we can just hang out
by the milkshakes the whole time.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.672
Right.

37:11.646 --> 37:12.854
It tickles.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.398
Your arms are ticklish?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.400
They are now, I guess.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.861
I wasn't aware that could happen.

37:29.247 --> 37:33.083
What happened, Enoch, to your parents?

37:41.676 --> 37:42.842
Please?

37:48.391 --> 37:51.768
We were coming back
from visiting my aunt in Seattle.

37:53.980 --> 37:59.317
She won some award for her writing
on African freedom music or something.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.368
I was dozing off in the back.

38:11.038 --> 38:15.375
Cops told me the guy was so drunk
he didn't even remember the accident.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.046
Mom and...

38:23.050 --> 38:26.052
They were dead
before the ambulance showed up.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.890
I was in a coma for three months,

38:33.894 --> 38:37.105
and I guess I was actually dead
for a few minutes.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.278
Is that when you started
seeing Hiroshi?

38:46.324 --> 38:47.824
I believe you.

38:49.910 --> 38:50.994
Yeah.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.166
When I woke up,
he was just sitting by my bed.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.116
J... J... J...

39:31.952 --> 39:34.120
- J-9.
- Miss.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.542
I saw a Mitsubishi car today.

39:39.627 --> 39:40.794
So what?

39:40.878 --> 39:42.087
I used to fly a Mitsubishi.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.297
You mean you used to crash a Mitsubishi.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.760
Only once.

39:49.637 --> 39:50.720
A- 5.

39:51.055 --> 39:53.098
How do you get my battleship so quickly?

39:53.391 --> 39:54.474
Instinct.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.649
We used to have a Toyota when I was a kid.

40:03.234 --> 40:04.234
Toyota, too?

40:04.318 --> 40:06.986
Yeah. We're cool with you guys now.

40:07.822 --> 40:08.947
"Cool"?

40:10.032 --> 40:11.491
Friends.

40:16.789 --> 40:19.499
F- 6?

40:19.583 --> 40:20.875
Miss.

40:24.338 --> 40:26.840
How long does she have? The girl?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.342
- D- 4.
- Hit.

40:31.011 --> 40:33.513
I don't know.
Still not very long.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.767
Are you having fun with your game?

40:37.852 --> 40:39.018
It's not a game.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.981
You wanna know what I think?

40:43.065 --> 40:45.608
Not really.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.861
I think you've gone too far.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.280
Strangers' funerals are one thing...

40:50.364 --> 40:51.698
Your coordinate.

40:52.533 --> 40:53.616
She's actually gonna die soon.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.285
Your coordinate!

41:02.168 --> 41:03.251
D- 3.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.378
Hit.

41:09.008 --> 41:11.092
Everything okay over there?

41:11.886 --> 41:13.261
Yeah. Sorry.

41:26.901 --> 41:31.613
You know, these... Actually, these visits
are just supposed to be family only.

41:34.074 --> 41:37.160
But Annie asked me to come, so...

41:37.244 --> 41:38.328
Hey.

41:39.705 --> 41:40.997
How'd it go?

41:41.081 --> 41:44.834
You know, same old, same old. Still dying.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.921
But still, like, a bit?

41:48.005 --> 41:50.215
They try not to say any more.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.218
At least you got your health.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.345
I feel like I wanna, you know...
I wanna be careful.

41:55.429 --> 41:57.722
- Annie?
- What?

41:57.806 --> 41:58.973
Where are you going?

41:59.058 --> 42:02.018
Home. Dr. Lee said I'm all done.

42:02.102 --> 42:03.186
Are you gonna wait for me?

42:03.270 --> 42:05.230
- Lizzie.
- Yeah?

42:05.314 --> 42:09.192
How old am I?

42:09.276 --> 42:11.194
Okay, I get it, I get it.

42:11.278 --> 42:13.279
Okay, I'll see you later.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.365
- How much later?
- Late.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.867
I don't really love the way that sounds.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.703
Lizzie, it's Halloween. Lighten up.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.042
This night must be weird for you.

42:26.126 --> 42:29.212
Yes. Yes, it is.

42:29.296 --> 42:32.757
Hey, did you guys still do
that seppuku thing in the war?

42:35.094 --> 42:39.097
Seppuku. And no, that was the samurai.

42:39.181 --> 42:41.516
How did that work, exactly?

42:41.600 --> 42:44.727
You would take a small blade
and gut yourself.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.689
Slit across the abdomen
to open your stomach.

42:47.773 --> 42:49.607
Trick or treat!

42:54.863 --> 42:56.322
You know,

42:57.283 --> 42:59.867
you don't have to protect me anymore.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.662
What do you mean?

43:03.956 --> 43:05.415
With Annabel.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.794
I know she's gonna die,

43:09.878 --> 43:11.504
and that's okay.

43:15.009 --> 43:16.467
If you say so.

43:19.346 --> 43:21.222
- What?
- We're here.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.560
How do you know where she lives?

43:25.644 --> 43:27.895
I have a lot of free time.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.063
That's kind of creepy.

43:29.148 --> 43:31.524
I'm a ghost.

43:31.609 --> 43:34.736
Okay, ghost. Happy Halloween.

43:34.820 --> 43:36.404
Happy Halloween.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.123
Boo!

43:53.130 --> 43:54.213
Nice.

44:12.107 --> 44:14.067
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat.

44:17.988 --> 44:21.908
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

44:23.243 --> 44:24.911
What did you get?

44:29.750 --> 44:32.919
How is it possible that you've never been
to a haunted house before?

44:33.003 --> 44:34.837
I don't know, I just haven't.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.673
Not even those lame ones at school

44:36.757 --> 44:40.510
where you have the spaghetti brains
and grape eyeballs and stuff?

44:40.594 --> 44:42.970
Brains do not feel like spaghetti.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.222
How do you know?

44:44.306 --> 44:46.766
I know a thing or two
about brains.

44:46.850 --> 44:48.351
Right.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.314
Birdie, are you okay?

44:53.399 --> 44:55.274
Yeah, just... Hold on.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.126
Holy shit, Brae. I thought you were dead.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.128
Hey, Oz.

45:15.212 --> 45:17.755
- Nice costume.
- Thanks, you, too.

45:19.425 --> 45:20.717
This is Annabel.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.009
- Hey.
- Hey.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.138
Annie, this is Ozzie.
We went to school together.

45:25.222 --> 45:28.266
Hey, Brae,
I think you two should get out of here.

45:28.350 --> 45:31.102
Why? Think we can't handle it?

45:31.186 --> 45:34.981
No, just trust me. You guys should just...

45:36.024 --> 45:37.567
I don't believe this.

45:37.651 --> 45:39.527
Oh, shit. We got to get out of here.

45:39.611 --> 45:40.653
- Why?
- Now.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.156
Brae, you little shit.

45:43.240 --> 45:46.325
Enoch, what the hell is going on?
Why are we running?

45:46.410 --> 45:48.327
- Get in the car.
- Why was that kid so mad at you?

45:48.412 --> 45:51.205
- Open the goddamn door, Ozzie!
- I'm trying!

45:51.290 --> 45:53.624
Payback time, you little faggot!

45:55.043 --> 45:57.420
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

46:02.593 --> 46:06.471
Okay, is somebody gonna tell me
what the hell that was all about?

46:06.555 --> 46:07.930
That was Alger Cofax.

46:08.015 --> 46:11.100
He made some joke
about Enoch's parents after...

46:11.935 --> 46:13.686
- After they...
- Died.

46:14.938 --> 46:16.105
Right.

46:16.190 --> 46:19.859
So, Enoch beat the living shit out of him.
Put him in the hospital for a week.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.862
So that's why you got kicked out of school.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.823
- Stop.
- What?

46:25.908 --> 46:27.325
Stop the car, Oz.

46:27.409 --> 46:29.952
- At least let me get into town or...
- Stop the car now!

46:39.296 --> 46:41.923
- He okay?
- Probably just carsick or something.

46:42.007 --> 46:44.133
- Okay.
- Okay, thanks for the lift.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.135
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, we'll be fine.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.012
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

46:48.096 --> 46:49.847
Take it easy, Brae.

46:52.559 --> 46:53.976
Enoch?

46:54.937 --> 46:56.187
Enoch.

46:56.271 --> 46:57.605
Over here.

47:02.611 --> 47:04.153
Are you okay?

47:04.238 --> 47:05.905
Kind of.

47:05.989 --> 47:07.156
You?

47:07.950 --> 47:09.534
I'm okay.

47:09.618 --> 47:10.743
Good.

47:14.873 --> 47:16.332
Looks lonely.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.127
My dad was a forester.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.879
Yeah?

47:21.964 --> 47:23.798
Might still be.

47:42.609 --> 47:43.776
Annabel?

47:53.787 --> 47:56.497
Man. You actually look terrifying.

47:56.665 --> 47:58.958
Yeah? That's nothing.

48:07.467 --> 48:08.634
Annie?

48:11.847 --> 48:13.097
Annabel?

48:16.476 --> 48:18.811
Okay, this is kind of not funny.

49:04.024 --> 49:06.359
I'm gonna get you, little ghost.

49:32.594 --> 49:35.137
Why are you trespassing in my woods?

49:35.222 --> 49:36.847
I'm sorry.

49:36.932 --> 49:40.226
I was looking for my girlfriend.
I think she came this way.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.980
Nobody has passed through these woods
for years.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.481
What did she look like?

49:45.565 --> 49:48.609
She is about your height, brown eyes.

49:51.446 --> 49:52.571
Was she pretty?

49:52.656 --> 49:55.241
Beautiful. Who are you?

49:55.325 --> 49:58.119
I am the spirit of this forest.

49:58.412 --> 49:59.578
Can you help me?

49:59.663 --> 50:04.500
This girl, you must care about her a lot
to come into the woods looking for her.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.293
Very much.

50:07.921 --> 50:09.213
Come with me.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.310
Is this your home?

50:23.395 --> 50:25.104
Yes, it is.

50:25.188 --> 50:26.731
Please come in.

50:43.832 --> 50:44.957
Sit.

50:56.970 --> 50:58.637
Do you know what this does?

50:59.139 --> 51:00.473
No.

51:01.808 --> 51:04.977
It lets you see
what you truly want in this world.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.897
I want you to have it.

51:20.786 --> 51:22.078
Try it.

51:24.706 --> 51:26.373
What I truly want?

51:33.965 --> 51:35.466
Is it working?

51:36.927 --> 51:38.010
Yes.

53:10.687 --> 53:12.980
Oh, my God. We're saved!

53:48.642 --> 53:51.769
So, what was it like?

53:58.485 --> 53:59.652
Okay.

54:04.074 --> 54:05.157
Are you gonna do it again?

54:06.618 --> 54:07.660
Hiroshi.

54:14.584 --> 54:16.001
Did it make her happy?

55:38.877 --> 55:40.169
Okay.

55:41.212 --> 55:42.254
Yellow- footed gull.

55:43.131 --> 55:45.341
Why do we only do this one chapter?

55:45.425 --> 55:47.051
'Cause it's my favorite.

55:47.135 --> 55:49.970
What's so great about water birds, anyway?

55:50.805 --> 55:52.014
I don't know.

55:52.098 --> 55:54.224
They can go anywhere they want.

55:54.309 --> 55:56.518
They're the only birds that can do that.

55:56.603 --> 55:59.813
Not just the air and the land,
but the sea, too.

55:59.898 --> 56:03.025
When are we gonna get to the birds of prey?
'Cause eagles can, like, kill...

56:03.109 --> 56:05.736
Yellow- footed gull.

56:05.820 --> 56:07.780
So, that's a no?

56:07.864 --> 56:09.073
Yellow- footed gull.

56:11.618 --> 56:12.826
Larus Livens.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.287
Wing span?

56:16.623 --> 56:18.624
Fifty-five inches?

56:18.708 --> 56:21.001
- Life span?
- Seven to ten years.

56:23.588 --> 56:25.214
Very impressive.

56:31.262 --> 56:34.098
You know, I wonder

56:35.433 --> 56:37.643
what my wing span is.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.979
Well, I know my life span.

56:44.025 --> 56:45.401
Yeah, yeah.

56:59.791 --> 57:03.669
So I was thinking about donating my body
to science.

57:05.004 --> 57:06.755
Why?

57:06.840 --> 57:10.717
Because maybe I could
help somebody like me.

57:10.802 --> 57:11.885
It's disgusting.

57:14.013 --> 57:15.305
What's disgusting?

57:17.434 --> 57:21.019
I mean, all those science guys
cutting you up

57:21.104 --> 57:25.941
and putting you in jars and microscopes

57:26.025 --> 57:28.902
and those dish things.

57:29.904 --> 57:32.990
I think I might like to have
my eyes in a jar.

57:36.369 --> 57:39.830
They're nice, right? My eyes.

57:40.999 --> 57:43.208
Let's not talk about it, okay?

57:47.130 --> 57:49.339
You don't think they're nice?

57:51.217 --> 57:54.803
They are. It's just, you know...

57:54.888 --> 57:57.139
Would you come and visit them?

58:00.727 --> 58:02.769
I guess.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.188
You guess?

58:05.064 --> 58:12.112
Yeah.

58:12.197 --> 58:14.281
Yeah, I would.

58:14.365 --> 58:16.033
Of course I would.

58:19.078 --> 58:20.829
Of course you would.

58:56.199 --> 58:57.366
Annie?

59:00.203 --> 59:02.162
I got your Darwin books.

59:04.123 --> 59:05.874
They had a new print
of Voyage of the Beagle.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.960
I know it's your favorite.

59:10.463 --> 59:11.630
Annie?

59:15.093 --> 59:16.134
Annabel?

59:17.136 --> 59:18.303
Annie.

59:19.556 --> 59:21.181
Hold on, Annabel.

59:26.646 --> 59:27.813
No.

59:28.606 --> 59:30.607
It's okay. I'm gonna be okay.

59:33.486 --> 59:36.822
- Tell me about the birds, Enoch.
- What?

59:37.156 --> 59:40.409
The songbirds.
Why do they sing in the morning?

59:41.911 --> 59:45.205
They sing because they're happy
to be alive another day.

59:45.957 --> 59:48.667
I've sung every morning since I met you.

59:49.586 --> 59:52.629
- I'm not letting you go, Annabel.
- Let me go.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.381
Enoch, let me go.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.300
I can't.

59:58.094 --> 59:59.553
I love you.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:02.389
I love you so much.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.891
I've never been so happy.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.770
I've never been so...

01:00:15.486 --> 01:00:16.945
Hey, Annabel?

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:19.031
Annabel!

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:23.201
Oh, God, no!

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.287
Hold on, Annie.

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.039
I'm coming with you.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.041
What are you doing?

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:32.461
What? I'm following you into death.
What more do you want from a guy?

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:35.130
Wait. That's not in the script.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.466
That is so not in the script.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.343
I know.
I added it in for this run.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:42.304
But that's ridiculous.
It makes no sense.

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:46.099
What do you mean, "Makes no sense"?
Like all that bird singing stuff does.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:48.143
It totally upstages my passing.

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:49.796
You can't just stab yourself...

01:00:49.797 --> 01:00:51.097
- to death, like...
- I'm not stabbing.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:53.982
I'm disemboweling. It's called seppuku.

01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:57.736
Okay. Whatever.
You cannot seppuku yourself to death

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:01.406
right after I just had the most tragic
and beautiful end.

01:01:03.117 --> 01:01:05.577
- Who says?
- Me.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.997
And all that bird stuff,
that's stuff that we agreed on.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:10.999
And you seemed to like it just fine
when we wrote it.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.418
Well, I don't like it anymore.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:16.046
It's sappy and corny.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.674
All the repeating the ends
of the lines?

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:21.843
"Don't be gone, don't be gone".
"Let me go, let me go".

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.805
Okay, but nobody also
disembowels themselves...

01:01:24.889 --> 01:01:28.350
right after their girlfriend dies in their
arms from a terminal brain tumor.

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:30.477
How do you know?

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:33.438
Oh, my God.
This was such a mistake.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.190
What was a mistake?

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:36.441
This!

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:40.445
Well, fine.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.406
It's your dumb death scene.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:44.825
You obviously don't want my help.

01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.284
- I quit.
- Fine.

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.256
Good.

01:01:47.357 --> 01:01:51.157
I don't need to die in anybody's arms.
It'll be much sadder alone.

01:01:55.169 --> 01:01:57.796
- Where are you going?
- I'm out of here.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:05.846
- You think you can just leave like that?
- Why not? Isn't that what you're gonna do?

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:09.474
- You think I want to?
- It doesn't matter, though, does it?

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.476
So, what has this been?

01:02:12.645 --> 01:02:13.895
I don't know.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.897
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:21.027
So, what? You're just gonna go back
to making fun of people's funerals?

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:22.946
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:02:23.781 --> 01:02:27.951
You know what?
You're a coward. That's all you are.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:31.246
You know, I hope you and your ghost friend
have a good life together,

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:34.040
throwing rocks and acting like
two-year-olds.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.584
You tell him that I said that.

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:37.544
I made it up.

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:40.046
- What?
- He's not real.

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:43.633
- But you said that...
- I've been there, Annabel.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:47.012
I was dead for three minutes.

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:49.139
And you know what's there?

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:50.474
Nothing.

01:02:51.684 --> 01:02:55.520
No ghosts. No sappy lines about birds.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.065
No parents. No goodbyes.

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:01.818
Just nothing.

01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:43.610
Thank you, everyone, for gathering
this evening to honor my brother, Hans.

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:47.906
I've been looking up to Hans
since I was born.

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:52.035
He was my hero. He was my big, big brother.

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:55.121
Over the years, Hans taught me many things.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:04:00.001
He taught me how to catch fish in bell jars
in the rivers of Wisconsin.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:05.173
He taught me how to take a punch
in elementary school.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.466
Good heavens.

01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:10.303
In high school,
he even counseled me on French kissing.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:16.351
- Golf at 5:00.
- All right.

01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:24.067
Hello.

01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.152
Enoch, right?

01:04:26.237 --> 01:04:27.529
Yeah, Enoch.

01:04:27.613 --> 01:04:29.823
Annabel talks a lot about you.

01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:32.534
What can I do for you?

01:04:32.618 --> 01:04:36.705
I know you're really busy or whatever,
so I'll make this quick.

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:38.373
I'm just doing my rounds.

01:04:38.457 --> 01:04:40.166
I have some time.
What's on your mind?

01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:42.878
I wanted to talk about Annabel.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:44.421
Okay.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:46.298
Make her better.

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:51.469
I don't think you understand
what we're trying to do here.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:52.637
No, I understand.

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:57.267
She's sick
and you were trying to get her better.

01:04:57.351 --> 01:05:00.645
But now everybody's giving up,
and I just think that...

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.022
Enoch.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.774
We did everything we could.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.651
Now it's just about making her
as comfortable as...

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.653
Make her better!

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:11.865
I mean, what do you do here,
just watch people die?

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:12.991
Watch your tongue.

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.910
Why don't you start doing
what you're paid to do?

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:18.371
I mean,
how much are they paying you?

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.915
To sit around and kill people?

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:21.666
Dr. Lee here.
Yeah, just need security...

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.702
- to come escort...
- Why don't you just call...

01:05:22.703 --> 01:05:23.903
one of the good doctors?

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:26.087
No, no, no, not a big deal.
I'm...

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:28.724
Why don't you call
one of them, huh?

01:05:30.217 --> 01:05:31.468
Come on.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.553
Say something!

01:05:41.145 --> 01:05:42.270
I got him.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.272
Enoch, calm down, man.
Come on.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:47.400
Come on, now! No!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.110
- No!
- Hey, hey.

01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:51.446
- Come on.
- It's bullshit!

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.782
- Come on, man. We have to do this.
- I didn't do anything!

01:05:53.866 --> 01:05:55.033
- Come on!
- Calm down!

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:21.601
- Enoch, wait.
- What?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:25.105
Will you just... Will you tell me
what I can do? How can I help?

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.774
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:30.485
- Please.
- You can't do anything.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:32.654
You know, I dropped my whole life for you!

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:34.239
I left Seattle, I left my friends,

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.741
I left everything I love
so that I could be here for you.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.661
- I never asked you to.
- No, but I'm here.

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:42.580
I'm here, I'm your family, and I'm trying.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:46.876
What is it?

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:52.424
Do you realize

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.343
that they're dead

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:57.387
because of your stupid award?

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.015
What are you talking about?

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:02.559
You blame me for that?

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:06.104
Oh, my God.
Your mother decided to get in the car

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.897
- and come up to Seattle to...
- I don't care. I don't care!

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:09.566
I care! I care.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:12.444
You didn't care enough to wait
to have the funeral!

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.195
- I didn't get to say goodbye!
- My God!

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.698
Nobody thought you would make it!

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:19.576
Well, I wish they'd been right.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.953
Don't say that. Don't...

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.455
Enoch, wait.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:55.737
Baby Snickers.
Are you caramel or nut or chocolate?

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:01.743
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:04.913
- What's all this?
- Halloween candy.

01:08:04.997 --> 01:08:08.875
I'm sorting it into phylum,
class, order and suborder.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:10.460
It's getting complicated.

01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:12.462
Yeah, it sounds like it.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:14.923
- Need help?
- Sure.

01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:17.634
Have a seat by CandycorniAnnabelus.

01:08:17.718 --> 01:08:19.344
Sounds delicious.

01:08:21.971 --> 01:08:27.227
So, I'm having trouble figuring out
the candy that has a lot going on.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.395
- Okay, like what?
- Basically, the candy bars.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.946
Problem solved.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:39.447
Why didn't I think of that?

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.866
'Cause that's what I'm here for.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.828
Annie?

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.372
I'm okay.

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:53.086
Licorice family.

01:08:55.589 --> 01:08:58.133
So do you want to talk about Enoch?

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.301
What's there to talk about?

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.475
Do you miss your old boyfriends?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.769
No.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.189
You had a bunch, huh?

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:14.399
What are you implying?

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.652
Nothing. There just always seemed
to be a guy around.

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.279
Maybe a couple.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:26.743
I remember looking at their hands and faces
and thinking how handsome they were.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.163
Yeah, well, not so many anymore.

01:09:31.542 --> 01:09:32.876
'Cause of me, huh?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.502
No, Annie.

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:40.008
I always wanted to be like you.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:43.386
With your friends
and your bags and your boys.

01:09:43.804 --> 01:09:46.014
God, I was... I was an idiot.

01:09:46.098 --> 01:09:50.518
I mean, none of that stuff ever...
Annie?

01:09:50.603 --> 01:09:54.480
Oh, God. Mom? Mom, call 911!
I got you.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.065
Mom, wake up!

01:09:58.485 --> 01:09:59.944
Got you, I got you.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.988
- Oh, my God, baby, no. No.
- It's okay.

01:10:02.072 --> 01:10:03.656
- No.
- Mom, call an ambulance!

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.867
No, no, no, no. Don't leave me.

01:10:05.951 --> 01:10:07.952
Mom, do it now!

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:12.999
Hey, baby. Come back, now.
We're right here. We're right here.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:15.877
Enoch.

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:19.005
- What are you doing with that?
- Leave me alone.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:22.091
- I have to tell you...
- Go home!

01:10:22.176 --> 01:10:23.718
- Just stop.
- No!

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.646
You think you can just leave me here?

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:38.274
You think you can just go
and not come back?

01:10:44.823 --> 01:10:48.785
I hate you!

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.579
She's dying, Enoch.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:52.997
No shit!

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:59.045
Are you going to smash her grave, too?

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.050
You have no respect for the dead.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.803
You have no respect for anything.

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.930
Why should I listen to you?

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:12.517
You're just a pathetic ghost
who took the easy way out.

01:11:14.853 --> 01:11:17.563
Think you were honoring your family
by dying?

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:21.025
Here we call that abandoning them!

01:11:29.868 --> 01:11:31.327
You think you have nothing?

01:11:31.662 --> 01:11:33.955
You have everything.

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.540
You want to see what nothing feels like?

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.501
Do you?

01:11:38.585 --> 01:11:41.212
Do it! Do it!

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.447
I'm sorry, Auntie.

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:23.421
I thought I told you
to stay out of here.

01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:26.174
How you feeling?

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:27.967
I'm all right.

01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:30.136
Good. I'm sorry about the food.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.306
It's the biggest complaint we get,
so I'm kind of anticipating.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.767
It's fine, thanks.

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.603
Well, that's, I think, the first time
I've ever heard that.

01:12:41.398 --> 01:12:44.025
I'm sorry about all that stuff I said.

01:12:45.027 --> 01:12:47.945
- It was really messed up.
- It's... it's okay.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.406
I know what it's like to lose.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:51.949
You do?

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:53.201
I do.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:57.622
But I'm not here to get an apology.

01:12:57.706 --> 01:12:59.832
I actually came with a gift.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.170
Where'd you get this?

01:13:05.422 --> 01:13:07.340
A very beautiful girl just gave it to me.

01:13:07.716 --> 01:13:09.926
Was worried you didn't have enough to read.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.805
I'm sure she'd like to see you.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.644
I'm not so sure, Doc.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:23.022
I found the chapter on water birds
very interesting.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:32.031
Oh, my God.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:34.075
Hello, Enoch.

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:41.165
Sorry.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:45.753
Me, too.

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:51.342
I'm glad that she's okay. Annabel.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:53.928
Yeah.

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.264
When are you going to see her?

01:13:59.726 --> 01:14:01.060
You're not going to see her?

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.190
Caused enough damage already.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.279
Besides, you know,
she probably wants to...

01:14:13.657 --> 01:14:15.491
just go out

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.954
with her family, you know.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.634
It's a letter.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:36.512
Just a letter.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:39.390
- From who?
- No, I wrote it.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.726
It's for a girl.

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:48.274
Before we went up,
we wrote letters to our loved ones.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:54.530
And we were supposed
to give them to a friend to deliver.

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.533
But you didn't.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:04.081
No. I never did.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:13.841
You know, we have so little time
to say the things we mean.

01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:19.680
We have so little time for any of it.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:34.862
Go to her.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:02.557
Hiroshi?

01:16:52.983 --> 01:16:54.358
Hey.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:13.836
I heard you got in a fight.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:17.381
Sort of.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.843
No more fights.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:23.929
Okay, Birdie.

01:17:58.799 --> 01:18:00.299
I love you.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.247
I brought you something.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.050
Took me forever to find this dumb thing.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:11.263
Finally tracked one down
at a toy store in Old Town.

01:20:17.729 --> 01:20:19.230
Thanks, Enoch.

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.192
Better late than never, right?

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.748
I wish I could do more,
you know?

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.752
Like take you to the Galapagos,

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:45.422
or make it be spring or something.

01:20:48.885 --> 01:20:50.511
Something better.

01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:54.265
You did enough.

01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:57.101
- I did?
- Yeah.

01:20:58.895 --> 01:21:00.062
Swear?

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:02.940
Yeah.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.202
Got to go soon, Birdie.

01:21:18.081 --> 01:21:19.623
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.001
Is that okay?

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:35.097
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.523
Enoch!

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.533
Hiroshi?

01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:46.126
What are you doing here?
I thought you were...

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.336
You're back.

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:52.424
It's a long trip.
I thought she could use the company.

01:22:56.262 --> 01:22:58.347
It's really good to see you.

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:00.265
You, too, Enoch.

01:23:19.202 --> 01:23:23.872
As I write this letter,
the ocean breeze feels cool on my skin.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.669
That very ocean is soon to be my grave.

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:31.005
They tell me I will die a hero.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:36.051
That the safety and honor of my country
will be the reward for my sacrifice.

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:38.345
I pray they are right.

01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:42.349
My only regret in life
is never telling you how I feel.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.268
I wish I were back home.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.063
I wish I were holding your hand.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:50.774
I wish I were telling you
that I have loved you,

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.443
and only you, since I was a boy.

01:23:53.611 --> 01:23:55.362
But I'm not.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:58.365
I see now that death is easy.

01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.992
It is love that is hard.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:06.206
As my plane dives,
I will not see the face of my enemies.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.833
I will instead see your eyes,

01:24:08.752 --> 01:24:12.296
like black rocks frozen in rainwater.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:16.633
They tell us that we must scream, "Banzai,"
as we plunge into our target.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.805
I will instead whisper your name.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.224
And in death, as in life,

01:24:24.976 --> 01:24:27.644
I will remain forever yours.

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:30.481
Ensign Hiroshi Takahashi.

01:24:42.994 --> 01:24:45.871
She said you guys came up with it together.

01:24:45.955 --> 01:24:47.498
Yeah.

01:24:56.633 --> 01:24:58.342
Not now.

01:25:23.868 --> 01:25:25.619
Elizabeth?

01:25:25.703 --> 01:25:27.371
Yes, Enoch?

01:25:28.748 --> 01:25:31.834
You think I could say a few words later?

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:34.336
Yeah, I think that would be okay.

01:25:41.719 --> 01:25:44.179
It was amazing to see her courage.

01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:47.349
And her passion.

01:25:47.433 --> 01:25:49.351
And I miss her already.
