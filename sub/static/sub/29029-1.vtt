00:58.490 --> 00:59.323
- Yeah.

00:59.323 --> 01:00.840
- [Man] How's the Donaldson audit coming?

01:00.840 --> 01:01.700
- Almost done.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.041
- [Man] Thanks.

01:03.041 --> 01:05.208
(dinging)

01:10.689 --> 01:11.935
- Hey!

01:11.935 --> 01:13.527
- Oh, hey, how you doing?

01:13.527 --> 01:18.123
- No, I told you, how
you doing? (giggling)

01:18.123 --> 01:19.510
- Why do you always think
that's so hilarious?

01:19.510 --> 01:21.450
- Because it is.

01:21.450 --> 01:23.063
Joey was so cute and funny.

01:24.140 --> 01:25.491
Come on, "Friends" was awesome, right?

01:25.491 --> 01:26.324
- You mean that show

01:26.324 --> 01:27.809
where only white people are in New York?

01:27.809 --> 01:29.324
- Whatever.

01:29.324 --> 01:30.500
So?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.310
- So I guess the Q3
numbers are a little off

01:33.310 --> 01:34.987
but I'm just gonna change
some things in there.

01:34.987 --> 01:35.820
- What, no, no, no.

01:35.820 --> 01:36.950
Aren't you gonna ask me about my trip?

01:36.950 --> 01:37.783
- Hey, you've been gone?

01:37.783 --> 01:39.607
I didn't even notice, oh.

01:40.566 --> 01:42.545
- Oh, okay, yes I've been gone.

01:42.545 --> 01:44.520
Check that shit out.

01:44.520 --> 01:45.860
- Oh damn.

01:45.860 --> 01:47.400
You get that close to a grizzly bear?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.233
- Yup.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.066
- That's stupid.

01:49.066 --> 01:50.450
- I know, it's pretty sweet, right?

01:50.450 --> 01:52.770
- No, I don't mean like your
a millennial cool hip stupid,

01:52.770 --> 01:53.640
I mean that's really stupid.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.830
Those things can kill you.

01:54.830 --> 01:56.406
- What, no.

01:56.406 --> 01:58.940
Joe, there's a ranger present.

01:58.940 --> 02:00.340
And you know, there's
so much salmon around,

02:00.340 --> 02:02.039
those bears don't even care we're there.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.850
God, seeing those bears

02:03.850 --> 02:06.110
in the wild like that, life changing.

02:06.110 --> 02:08.740
- Well, I'd never do that.

02:08.740 --> 02:10.050
- Awesome.

02:10.050 --> 02:11.280
Is it up on the server?

02:11.280 --> 02:12.670
- Up and ready to be seen.

02:12.670 --> 02:14.190
- Hey, question.

02:14.190 --> 02:16.170
Can't you force Joe to take vacation time?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.266
I mean, before he completely
loses any semblance

02:18.266 --> 02:19.724
of a life?

02:19.724 --> 02:23.238
- Well then who's gonna
make up for all your work?

02:23.238 --> 02:25.488
(scoffing)

02:27.038 --> 02:28.010
Are you flipping me of, Amelia?

02:28.010 --> 02:29.271
- [Amelia] Maybe.

02:29.271 --> 02:30.790
- You have been taking a
lot of vacation time lately.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.280
I mean even for you.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.080
- Hey, there's a lot to see out there.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.310
We're not getting any younger.

02:36.310 --> 02:37.510
Especially you, grandpa.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.930
- That's easy for you to say, miss no kids

02:41.930 --> 02:43.780
and no infirm mom to take care of.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.510
- Okay you know what, will you stop that?

02:45.510 --> 02:48.390
You treat your divorce like
it is the end of your life.

02:48.390 --> 02:50.303
Ever just thought of it as a restart?

02:51.780 --> 02:54.090
What, we're not in the
final act of Joe's life,

02:54.090 --> 02:55.900
it's just act two.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.780
- Joe is fine.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.320
Joe doesn't need Amelia's judgment.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.750
- Well it's Joe's storm
'cause he created it.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.310
Joe needs to get his ass out and about.

03:03.310 --> 03:04.630
- I've been charged with making sure

03:04.630 --> 03:07.830
there's universal format for
our nomenclature this year.

03:07.830 --> 03:11.643
So I may need one or more
persons to help, thanks.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.570
- What's Amelia doing?

03:16.570 --> 03:19.990
- Amelia is just typing
a letter to Carol for Joe

03:19.990 --> 03:22.296
because Amelia knows Joe likes her.

03:22.296 --> 03:23.590
- What's Amelia talking about?

03:23.590 --> 03:24.560
Amelia has to stop.

03:24.560 --> 03:27.070
- Amelia sees how Joe lights
up when he talks to Carol

03:27.070 --> 03:29.410
so she's just helping Joe get on it.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.810
- Joe doesn't need Amelia's help.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.922
- How does Amelia send this thing?

03:33.922 --> 03:36.230
- Joe's getting really agitated.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.190
- Okay, Joe needs to calm down.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.443
- Amelia needs to stop.

03:38.443 --> 03:40.100
- Okay Amelia will stop in two seconds,

03:40.100 --> 03:42.255
once she figures out how
do you send this thing.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.517
- Amelia, no, no, no.

03:43.517 --> 03:44.350
Oh!

03:46.136 --> 03:48.886
(chair creaking)

03:50.712 --> 03:51.727
- I don't know.

03:51.727 --> 03:52.974
There's just this
vertigo I've been getting

03:52.974 --> 03:53.807
every once in a while.

03:53.807 --> 03:54.780
- When did that start?

03:54.780 --> 03:58.480
- I don't know, sometime
after the thing with my wife.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.313
- Ah, divorce.

03:59.313 --> 04:00.146
I think that's the word
you're looking for.

04:00.146 --> 04:02.392
- It only happens when I
get stressed out about stuff

04:02.392 --> 04:06.170
like when someone tries, emails
off my phone without asking.

04:06.170 --> 04:08.120
- Oh come on.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.174
Amelia was just trying to help Joe out.

04:10.174 --> 04:13.120
- Look, I'm just not ready for that

04:13.120 --> 04:14.720
looking for a new mate
thing right now, okay?

04:14.720 --> 04:16.740
- Ugh, give me a break.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.331
You got to break out of
this cycle of nonexistence.

04:19.331 --> 04:22.060
Seriously, man up, Joe.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.430
If you're not gonna go
out and meet people, fine.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.126
But you need to go out into the wild

04:26.126 --> 04:29.090
and find your inner Joe.

04:29.090 --> 04:30.260
- Inner?

04:30.260 --> 04:31.608
I get out, I mean I,

04:31.608 --> 04:34.020
I went on that trip to
Grand Canyon, remember that?

04:34.020 --> 04:35.340
- I do remember that.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.890
That's that Costco tour that you took

04:36.890 --> 04:39.480
with your parents in a bus
full of old Asian people.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.440
You sat on the bus and then
got out to see the canyon,

04:42.440 --> 04:43.650
and then McDonalds.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.968
- First of all, let me tell you

04:44.968 --> 04:45.918
there was at least,

04:47.170 --> 04:49.800
one or two people that weren't retired yet

04:49.800 --> 04:50.633
in that bus, okay?

04:50.633 --> 04:51.466
- Yeah, you were one of them.

04:51.466 --> 04:52.890
- And second of all, I'm not like you.

04:52.890 --> 04:55.600
I don't like backpacking
out to some remote canyon

04:55.600 --> 04:57.043
so I get trapped by a boulder

04:57.043 --> 04:58.547
and I have to cut my arm off with a pen.

04:58.547 --> 05:00.370
- (laughing) What?

05:00.370 --> 05:02.210
Did you recently watch 127 hours?

05:02.210 --> 05:03.064
- Yes.

05:03.064 --> 05:06.920
- (laughing) But, the
scenery in that movie.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.462
Epic slot canyons.

05:08.462 --> 05:10.526
That was awesome.

05:10.526 --> 05:11.359
- Yes, that was cool, okay?

05:11.359 --> 05:12.610
- Yes it was.

05:12.610 --> 05:13.690
Yes it was.

05:13.690 --> 05:14.840
You even watched that movie

05:14.840 --> 05:17.270
and I'm telling you,
you can experience that

05:17.270 --> 05:18.560
really, really easily.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.560
I can give you a list
of like a dozen places

05:20.560 --> 05:21.810
that you can go to.

05:21.810 --> 05:23.760
You just have to walk for a few minutes

05:23.760 --> 05:28.760
and you find yourself in
these god-amazing places.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.883
They're really easy adventures.

05:31.883 --> 05:32.730
- What, you got a
commission from the national

05:32.730 --> 05:34.030
park service or something?

05:35.090 --> 05:38.720
- I actually really like that,
really easy adventures, hmm.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.504
- All right, can we talk
about something else please?

05:40.504 --> 05:41.493
- Okay.

05:42.530 --> 05:45.864
Um, tell me what you believe in.

05:45.864 --> 05:46.697
- What?

05:47.540 --> 05:49.403
- Like do you support any causes?

05:50.264 --> 05:51.930
- I don't know, I guess I buy a calendar

05:51.930 --> 05:53.680
from the World Wildlife Fund every year.

05:53.680 --> 05:54.683
- You do?

05:55.830 --> 05:57.365
That's so adorable, Joe.

05:57.365 --> 05:58.198
- Oh my god.

05:58.198 --> 06:02.402
- Oh little animal lover Joe. (chuckling)

06:02.402 --> 06:04.703
Why are you staring at
your finger like a weirdo?

06:05.623 --> 06:06.999
Oh my god.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.400
- You talking about like
royalty clean old white guy

06:09.400 --> 06:11.910
or was he like dirty
commoner old white guy?

06:11.910 --> 06:14.340
- Hmm, I think royalty.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.860
'Cause he was with the queen.

06:15.860 --> 06:20.750
And this other old bearded
hunchback white guy.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.470
- Oh you're probably thinking
about her right hand man,

06:22.470 --> 06:24.081
the mad scientist kind of guy.

06:24.081 --> 06:26.260
- Oh, yeah, I can't keep up.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.378
- Why don't you just quit?

06:28.378 --> 06:29.211
- What?

06:29.211 --> 06:31.760
- Yeah I mean, you'd make
like a great naturalist

06:31.760 --> 06:32.760
or a trail guide or something.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.000
Why are you crunching numbers for the man?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.430
- I guess I never really knew what else

06:37.430 --> 06:38.343
I wanted to do.

06:40.082 --> 06:43.110
Yeah, everybody just told me
I should do something secure

06:43.110 --> 06:45.720
and practical like accounting.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.315
- What you have Asian parents too?

06:47.315 --> 06:48.653
- Hah, yeah.

06:50.850 --> 06:53.580
Oh and then you know Austin
really wanted that big house

06:53.580 --> 06:57.063
so kinda had to take this
job so we could afford it.

06:57.063 --> 06:58.093
- Makes sense.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.260
- Yeah, I guess it does.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.160
Except now I sit in my cubicle
everyday hating myself, so.

07:06.220 --> 07:09.440
- Well, hating yourself everyday
doesn't seem very healthy.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.543
- Why not, you do it.

07:11.383 --> 07:13.000
- I don't hate myself,
I like working here.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.570
- Oh, you hate yourself.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.730
You just don't realize it but I see it.

07:16.730 --> 07:21.053
This place crushes souls
into tiny little specks.

07:23.390 --> 07:26.050
- Well, if you're so enlightened,
why don't you just quit?

07:26.050 --> 07:28.418
Mostly so you can stop
pestering me about my life.

07:28.418 --> 07:30.668
(coughing)

07:33.100 --> 07:34.083
Grandpa, you okay?

07:36.730 --> 07:37.563
- Shut up.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.500
Actually, I need to work

07:42.500 --> 07:44.352
so that I can pay for
all the awesome traveling

07:44.352 --> 07:45.327
that I've been doing.

07:45.327 --> 07:47.670
God I bet you're sitting
on a bunch of savings

07:47.670 --> 07:51.300
and vacation pay 'cause you
live in the office 24-7.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.150
- Not quite.

07:52.150 --> 07:54.040
All this money I'm
supposed to be sitting on

07:54.040 --> 07:56.773
is going towards alimony
and mortgage for a house

07:56.773 --> 07:58.170
I don't live in anymore

07:58.170 --> 08:01.813
and medical stuff for my
mom so she can breathe.

08:01.813 --> 08:02.950
- Oh god, you always say that.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.490
Like you enjoy wallowing
in this pit of no life.

08:05.490 --> 08:07.870
- Oh yeah, I love spending every day

08:07.870 --> 08:10.743
getting bullied by my
domineering alien mother.

08:12.930 --> 08:15.730
Well, I guess it did work for
Norman Bates in Psycho, right?

08:15.730 --> 08:17.489
I mean he's normal, he's cool, right?

08:17.489 --> 08:20.474
- (laughing) You're stupid.

08:20.474 --> 08:23.057
(mask hissing)

08:28.573 --> 08:30.590
(sighing)

08:30.590 --> 08:31.600
- Hi mom, hi dad.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.900
- Joe, where have you been?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.930
My oxygen tank is almost empty.

08:34.930 --> 08:36.277
You want me to die?

08:36.277 --> 08:37.293
- If I wanted you to die,

08:37.293 --> 08:38.126
I wouldn't be paying for all this stuff

08:38.126 --> 08:39.510
to keep you alive now, would I?

08:39.510 --> 08:41.260
Besides you have like half
day left on your tank.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.816
- Oh, maybe, how do you know?

08:42.816 --> 08:45.133
The new tanks were delivered this morning.

08:47.070 --> 08:48.600
- Dad why can't you do this again?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.620
- I can't really turn the
knob with my right hand.

08:50.620 --> 08:53.600
- Dad's right, you should
move in here, help us out.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.111
- Well, if I do that, mom,

08:55.111 --> 08:55.944
then eventually I'd have to kill myself

08:55.944 --> 08:57.520
and you'd have no one around to help.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.470
- Oh stop talking stupid.

08:59.470 --> 09:02.023
You know, the new neighbors,
they moved in last week.

09:02.023 --> 09:03.750
A bunch of Indians.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.080
They have a dog, it
barks and barks all night

09:06.080 --> 09:07.990
driving me crazy, right Ming?

09:07.990 --> 09:09.260
- Huh, what?

09:09.260 --> 09:11.711
- Dog, the stupid dog next door.

09:11.711 --> 09:14.252
- [Ming] Give him samosa,
it's a curry dog, you know?

09:14.252 --> 09:15.650
- [Janice] What curry dog?

09:15.650 --> 09:17.240
- [Ming] I like the smell of curry.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.250
- Hey Joe, how's it going?

09:18.250 --> 09:20.293
Chicken combo, steamed veggies and fries?

09:20.293 --> 09:21.834
- Have I ordered that before?

09:21.834 --> 09:23.127
(laughing)

09:23.127 --> 09:26.153
- Let me get a chicken combo,
steamed veggies and fries.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.622
- [TV Narrator] They've
come across the lake

09:29.622 --> 09:30.625
from very far away,

09:30.625 --> 09:32.582
from any other sight that we've
seen through our time show.

09:32.582 --> 09:35.570
They're forming this for quite a while.

09:38.330 --> 09:41.259
The lions are closing in on a
leopard that's killed a young,

09:41.259 --> 09:43.926
(phone ringing)

09:55.078 --> 09:55.911
- Hello?

09:57.640 --> 09:58.473
Hey.

09:59.355 --> 10:01.630
(thunder rumbling and rain pattering)

10:01.630 --> 10:02.800
- Daddy!

10:02.800 --> 10:04.450
- Hey, goofball.

10:04.450 --> 10:06.214
Ready to see the awesome dentist?

10:06.214 --> 10:08.951
- I don't like the dentist,
I don't want to go.

10:08.951 --> 10:10.492
- That's just great.

10:10.492 --> 10:11.325
Oh look, look what I got you,

10:11.325 --> 10:12.730
a book about the stars.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.290
- Oh, cool dad.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.123
- Cool.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.560
Uh, hey Joyce.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.393
- Hey.

10:21.690 --> 10:23.760
- So what'd you do to the front yard?

10:23.760 --> 10:24.940
It's all different.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.800
- Oh yeah just some stuff
I wanted to change up

10:26.800 --> 10:27.670
for a little while.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.870
Um hey, thank you for taking him.

10:29.870 --> 10:31.580
I completely forgot about it.

10:31.580 --> 10:32.970
- That's fine, just next time,

10:32.970 --> 10:34.590
just give me earlier notice.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.640
- Yeah, okay, sorry.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.900
So just remember, after the
dentist, straight to school

10:38.900 --> 10:40.340
and then my mom's gonna pick him up.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.173
- Oh, okay.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.403
I could take him if you want.

10:42.403 --> 10:43.510
- No, no, it's fine.

10:43.510 --> 10:44.930
Wilson's been looking
forward to hanging out

10:44.930 --> 10:45.870
with my parents.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.200
- Actually, I'd rather--

10:47.200 --> 10:48.033
- Wilson.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.430
- Well, I mean, if Wilson wants
to come with me, it's cool.

10:51.430 --> 10:53.830
- No, no, my parents haven't
seen him for a few weeks

10:53.830 --> 10:56.433
and they really wanna
see him, so, it's fine.

10:58.370 --> 10:59.520
- All right, okay fine.

11:04.730 --> 11:07.400
- Okay, great, thank you.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.710
And I will see you tomorrow
night, honey bunny.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.243
Listen to Nana, okay?

11:24.728 --> 11:26.780
(sighing)

11:26.780 --> 11:30.250
- Mom's going to hang out
with Doug in Palm Springs.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.083
- Who?

11:31.083 --> 11:32.570
- That's her new friend
she hangs out with.

11:32.570 --> 11:34.320
I wasn't supposed to tell you that.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.740
- Hey Wilson, why don't
you check out your book

11:41.740 --> 11:42.663
about the stars?

11:45.160 --> 11:45.993
Wilson?

11:47.560 --> 11:48.643
Wilson.

11:55.327 --> 11:57.910
(car starting)

11:59.167 --> 12:02.000
(copier whirring)

12:06.536 --> 12:08.355
(clicking)

12:08.355 --> 12:09.188
Okay.

12:11.715 --> 12:13.248
Hey.
- Hey.

12:13.248 --> 12:14.850
- You're like the last person
I thought I'd find here

12:14.850 --> 12:16.700
unusually early in the morning.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.090
- Yeah, it's sad, right,
I'm becoming like you.

12:20.090 --> 12:20.923
- Oh, I see.

12:20.923 --> 12:21.756
What, you take the afternoon off

12:21.756 --> 12:24.792
and go ride polar bears in
Antarctica or something?

12:24.792 --> 12:27.432
- There are no polar
bears in the Antarctic.

12:27.432 --> 12:29.534
- Right.

12:29.534 --> 12:33.678
- No, I just needed to
get out of the house.

12:33.678 --> 12:34.970
- You all right?

12:34.970 --> 12:35.803
- Yeah.

12:36.900 --> 12:38.007
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.350
Just couldn't deal with
Austin this morning,

12:41.350 --> 12:43.983
so I had to get out.

12:45.502 --> 12:48.920
- Um, you wanna talk about it?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.993
- No, no I'm fine.

12:52.942 --> 12:53.942
- All right.

12:55.619 --> 12:58.060
(copier beeping)

12:58.060 --> 13:00.000
- Why are you here this early?

13:00.000 --> 13:02.170
- Well I'm hear because Joyce browbeat me

13:02.170 --> 13:03.600
to take the kid to the dentist at 6:30

13:03.600 --> 13:04.477
in the morning.

13:04.477 --> 13:06.220
- Mm, you know since you're divorced

13:06.220 --> 13:08.480
she shouldn't be able
to browbeat you anymore.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.087
- Oh, thanks for
emasculating me even further.

13:22.150 --> 13:23.760
- You guys done with the copier?

13:23.760 --> 13:24.983
- Um yeah.
- Hey Joe.

13:24.983 --> 13:26.257
- Hey, how you doing.

13:26.257 --> 13:27.850
- And Amelia.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.350
Unusual seeing you here
this early in the morning.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.080
- Really, Tanner?

13:34.477 --> 13:37.075
- I think I'm done.

13:37.075 --> 13:38.757

14:01.791 --> 14:04.827

14:04.827 --> 14:06.143
- [Woman] In the winter I
wanna help with the hernia

14:06.143 --> 14:08.110
and take away that risk

14:08.110 --> 14:10.660
but I don't wanna do any harm.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.160
- She said she'd been
seeing Austin for months

14:16.160 --> 14:18.480
and had no idea that
he was already married

14:18.480 --> 14:20.323
until she saw us together.

14:22.650 --> 14:27.650
And she was so shocked
and so mad, and, (sobbing)

14:30.754 --> 14:33.740
I just looked through his browser history

14:33.740 --> 14:36.562
and he'd been on all these dating sites.

14:36.562 --> 14:37.960
- Oh man.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.833
- And it just came just
sort of crashing down on me.

14:43.373 --> 14:45.540
(sobbing)

14:47.351 --> 14:49.018
- I'm sorry, Amelia.

14:53.510 --> 14:54.710
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

14:56.754 --> 14:58.204
- I know we had problems but,

15:00.470 --> 15:02.870
I never thought he would
do something like this.

15:03.874 --> 15:05.492
- Yeah.

15:05.492 --> 15:07.175
- I just feel so stupid.

15:07.175 --> 15:08.573
- No.

15:08.573 --> 15:10.060
Look, things happen, all right?

15:10.060 --> 15:12.410
Just, it'll be all right.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.403
Just give some time, all right?

15:16.013 --> 15:16.846
It'll be okay.

15:16.846 --> 15:17.679
- Okay.

15:23.513 --> 15:24.663
I can trust you, right?

15:26.950 --> 15:27.783
- Yeah.

15:28.957 --> 15:30.290
Yeah, of course.

16:01.976 --> 16:02.809
Hey.

16:04.348 --> 16:05.598
And she's gone.

16:18.197 --> 16:19.030
Shit!

16:21.480 --> 16:23.697
(keys clinking)

16:23.697 --> 16:24.530
Come on.

16:26.177 --> 16:28.844
(phone ringing)

16:37.222 --> 16:39.805
(somber music)

17:27.873 --> 17:30.123
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, what's up?

17:31.050 --> 17:35.450
So uh, what's up with the
police looking guy over there?

17:35.450 --> 17:38.130
- Oh, you mean the actual police?

17:38.130 --> 17:39.850
Yeah, they're here about Amelia.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.500
She took that week off a couple weeks ago

17:41.500 --> 17:43.500
but we haven't heard from her since.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.860
You still haven't talked to her, have you?

17:44.860 --> 17:45.693
- No.

17:45.693 --> 17:46.526
Usually when she goes on vacation

17:46.526 --> 17:48.200
she just lords it over me

17:48.200 --> 17:49.581
and I didn't even know she was gone.

17:49.581 --> 17:52.313
Actually, I'm kind of worried about her.

17:54.830 --> 17:57.440
- Look, she didn't ever
mention anything to you

17:57.440 --> 18:00.730
about taking money from the company?

18:00.730 --> 18:01.930
- What, like embezzling?

18:02.890 --> 18:04.260
No, I mean you don't think
she could do something

18:04.260 --> 18:05.093
like that, do you?

18:05.093 --> 18:07.570
- Actually, we kind of know she did.

18:07.570 --> 18:08.930
A few weeks back they were doing

18:08.930 --> 18:10.740
regularly internal audits and discovered

18:10.740 --> 18:13.340
about $30,000 missing.

18:13.340 --> 18:14.930
- Jesus, seriously?

18:14.930 --> 18:18.120
- Well, she actually sent the
money to various charities

18:18.120 --> 18:19.250
in our name.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.460
- Well, how do you know it was her?

18:20.460 --> 18:23.640
- She put her name down
as the contact person.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.810
She sent money to places
like the Sierra Club,

18:25.810 --> 18:27.426
the World Wildlife Foundation.

18:27.426 --> 18:28.259
(coughing)

18:28.259 --> 18:29.940
Whoah, whoah, whoah, dude, are you okay?

18:29.940 --> 18:31.623
- Uh yeah, yeah, I just,

18:32.640 --> 18:35.442
just surprised that she'd
do something like that.

18:35.442 --> 18:37.030
Are you gonna get the money back?

18:37.030 --> 18:38.800
- Are you kidding?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.360
If word gout out that we were taking money

18:40.360 --> 18:43.380
back from charities, that
would be very embarrassing

18:43.380 --> 18:44.230
for the company.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.722
Nah, I mean, we can afford it.

18:46.722 --> 18:48.467
It's just a write off,
I'm sure she knew that.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.717
I'm actually impressed
with her little stunt.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.423
- Uh, thanks.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.690
- All right.

19:39.690 --> 19:40.900
Thank you very much.

19:40.900 --> 19:41.900
- Good luck.

19:49.915 --> 19:52.082
(sighing)

20:02.659 --> 20:03.776
- Hey.

20:03.776 --> 20:04.803
- Can I help you?

20:05.640 --> 20:07.090
- Yeah, you're Austin, right?

20:07.090 --> 20:08.374
- Yeah, yeah.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.670
Do I know you?

20:09.670 --> 20:11.030
- I don't think so.

20:11.030 --> 20:14.739
I'm Joe, I work with Amelia
over at Kentex International.

20:14.739 --> 20:16.097
Actually I'm here because

20:16.097 --> 20:18.370
you know she hasn't been
around for the past few weeks

20:18.370 --> 20:21.034
and everyone at work's
kind of worried about her.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.150
Do you have any idea where she might be?

20:22.150 --> 20:24.360
- Yeah, see that's the thing.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.290
I'm not so sure myself.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.750
See she's been going
on these travels lately

20:29.750 --> 20:32.580
so at first I wasn't too worried

20:32.580 --> 20:33.963
but this time she's,

20:35.810 --> 20:37.133
she's been gone a while.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.233
I don't know where she went or why.

20:42.130 --> 20:44.573
- Really, you have no idea why.

20:45.450 --> 20:48.120
- Well you know Amelia, she gets these,

20:48.120 --> 20:49.850
these crazy ideas in her head.

20:49.850 --> 20:52.253
- Yeah like maybe you sleeping around?

20:53.350 --> 20:54.183
- Excuse me?

20:56.450 --> 20:59.550
- Uh yeah I think you heard me.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.530
- Maybe you should leave.

21:00.530 --> 21:03.395
- Maybe you should stop being an asshole.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.478
- Hey, you got a problem?

21:07.753 --> 21:08.814
- Oh jeez.

21:08.814 --> 21:09.647
Oh god.

21:09.647 --> 21:10.570
- Hey, hey calm down,
calm down, all right?

21:10.570 --> 21:11.403
I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

21:11.403 --> 21:12.480
- Okay.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.440
- Look, if you're calm,
I'm gonna let you go,

21:14.440 --> 21:15.273
all right?
- Okay, okay.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.106
- You calm?

21:16.106 --> 21:16.939
- Yeah, yeah.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.150
Jesus.

21:20.150 --> 21:20.983
- God.

21:22.260 --> 21:23.940
Look, I'm not proud of what I did.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.410
- Look, I don't have to
hear any of this, right?

21:25.410 --> 21:26.293
- Look, I just,

21:27.780 --> 21:29.580
I couldn't connect with her anymore.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.130
I reacted badly.

21:34.130 --> 21:35.580
I mean this last year, she's,

21:36.474 --> 21:38.070
she's been a loner.

21:38.070 --> 21:39.290
- Wait, what do you mean?

21:39.290 --> 21:40.763
- I mean she has no friends.

21:42.230 --> 21:44.500
I try and take her to parties and hang out

21:44.500 --> 21:46.093
with my buddies, but she just,

21:47.110 --> 21:49.580
she just quiet, she
doesn't talk to anyone.

21:49.580 --> 21:51.560
- Wait, Amelia not talking?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.613
- Yeah, isn't that,

21:53.594 --> 21:54.970
isn't that how she is at the office?

21:54.970 --> 21:56.143
- Uh, not really.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.033
- Yeah.

22:04.670 --> 22:05.503
Yeah, she,

22:06.850 --> 22:08.400
she used to be happy around me.

22:11.932 --> 22:14.307
Have you ever had someone
just stop loving you?

22:18.053 --> 22:18.970
- Um, yeah.

22:28.517 --> 22:31.184
(phone ringing)

22:51.909 --> 22:52.920
- What?

22:52.920 --> 22:53.982
Why do you have to go?

22:53.982 --> 22:54.815
- Just for a few days, mom.

22:54.815 --> 22:55.730
I'll stop by on my way back.

22:55.730 --> 22:57.177
- You want me to die?

22:57.177 --> 22:59.020
- You're not gonna die, all right?

22:59.020 --> 23:00.050
You're set for at least a week

23:00.050 --> 23:02.050
and Jim from next door is gonna come by.

23:02.050 --> 23:03.750
- I don't want him to be here, he smokes.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.520
- He's not gonna smoke
in the house, all right.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.213
Look, it's the best I could
do last minute, I'm sorry.

23:12.270 --> 23:13.103
- What's wrong?

23:13.103 --> 23:15.823
- Oh, nothing, I'm just
catching my breath.

23:17.604 --> 23:19.300
- [Mom] Where are you going?

23:19.300 --> 23:21.090
- I just gotta go, mom.

23:21.090 --> 23:22.840
- [Mom] What, you don't have to go!

23:34.976 --> 23:35.809
(thudding)

23:35.809 --> 23:38.213
- Ugh, dammit, stupid vertigo.

23:40.684 --> 23:42.851
(sighing)

23:58.790 --> 24:02.373
Well, let's do this.

24:06.519 --> 24:07.640
(light music)

24:07.640 --> 24:09.710
- [Amelia] My dear old man Joe,

24:09.710 --> 24:11.870
I have compiled a series of places

24:11.870 --> 24:13.280
that I think you should get out to

24:13.280 --> 24:16.250
so you can have some easy adventures.

24:16.250 --> 24:17.730
I've set up a few general rules

24:17.730 --> 24:20.020
as to what an easy adventure is.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.370
One, it has to be some place out in nature

24:22.370 --> 24:23.850
that is unique and amazing.

24:23.850 --> 24:26.522
Like make you feel you are
in another world amazing.

24:26.522 --> 24:29.150
Two, it should be relatively easy.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.670
No long brutal hikes, no
big mountains to climb,

24:31.670 --> 24:32.920
no crazy equipment,

24:32.920 --> 24:35.240
and definitely no open desert bike riding

24:35.240 --> 24:36.590
so you can fall into a canyon

24:36.590 --> 24:38.092
and have to cut off your arm.

24:38.092 --> 24:41.030
And three, you should be kind of alone

24:41.030 --> 24:42.130
on these adventures.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.380
No big touristy crowds
that totally takes away

24:44.380 --> 24:45.560
from the experience.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.890
There are a few exceptions
because some places

24:47.890 --> 24:49.470
you just have to see.

24:49.470 --> 24:51.930
Generally though, if it's
gonna feel like an adventure

24:51.930 --> 24:54.123
it needs to be just you and nature.

25:12.913 --> 25:14.190
(chimes ringing)

25:14.190 --> 25:15.163
- Can I help you?

25:16.030 --> 25:17.900
- Actually, I'm not sure.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.443
- [Attendant] You staying here?

25:20.650 --> 25:21.583
- I don't know.

25:23.018 --> 25:26.980
You know, can you tell me if
you've seen this girl around?

25:26.980 --> 25:29.240
- Uh, you Chinese?

25:29.240 --> 25:30.250
- What?

25:30.250 --> 25:32.010
- Chinese, you a Chinese guy?

25:32.010 --> 25:34.240
- Yeah, Chinese-American.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.123
Why?

25:38.270 --> 25:39.250
- Your friend left that,

25:39.250 --> 25:42.230
said a Chinese guy
named Joe might show up.

25:42.230 --> 25:43.530
Give him that.

25:43.530 --> 25:44.580
- How long ago was she here?

25:44.580 --> 25:45.900
- A while ago.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.160
- Did you talk to her by any chance?

25:47.160 --> 25:48.480
What was she doing, you know?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.160
- I don't know, I just check people in

25:50.160 --> 25:51.140
and check people out.

25:51.140 --> 25:52.380
I don't follow them.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.480
People seem to find that creepy.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.064
- Yeah, I mean.

25:56.064 --> 25:57.533
- Well go ahead, take it.

25:59.642 --> 26:01.590
- Just kind of weird.

26:01.590 --> 26:03.673
- Yeah that's pretty
much what I'm thinking.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.313
(sighing)

26:09.920 --> 26:12.680
All righty, why don't you give me a ID

26:12.680 --> 26:15.633
and a credit card and I'll
see if I can find you a room.

27:07.358 --> 27:08.310
(sighing)

27:08.310 --> 27:10.120
- [Man] Finally able to get up close,

27:10.120 --> 27:11.830
Michelle will first determine

27:11.830 --> 27:14.410
whether the reindeer can
handle another major surgery.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.780
- [Man] Newly green news.

27:15.780 --> 27:19.140
We know people love getting
extra large coffee sizes.

27:19.140 --> 27:23.223
That's why we're making available
our extra large tumbler.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.640
- Dude, Keyhole was dope.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.205
We gotta do that again.

27:28.205 --> 27:29.038
- No, Keyhole Canyon is done.

27:29.038 --> 27:30.510
Let's move on to some other Zion stuff

27:30.510 --> 27:31.660
like my bro told me.

27:31.660 --> 27:34.010
You could actually rappel
down Orderville Canyon

27:34.010 --> 27:35.390
and end up at the Narrows.

27:35.390 --> 27:36.350
It's pretty sick, right?

27:36.350 --> 27:37.183
- Sweet.

27:37.183 --> 27:38.200
- Uh, excuse me.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.900
Did you say something about the Narrows?

27:40.900 --> 27:42.150
- Yeah.

27:42.150 --> 27:44.440
- What exactly is the Narrows?

27:44.440 --> 27:45.604
- It's pretty awesome.

27:45.604 --> 27:47.410
You hike through this big ass canyon

27:47.410 --> 27:49.900
with these walls that like go on forever.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.430
- Like red rock skyscrapers,

27:51.430 --> 27:53.020
like Lord of the Rings kind of stuff.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.100
- Yeah if you start at the bottom

27:54.100 --> 27:55.510
it's pretty much all nice and flat.

27:55.510 --> 27:56.550
That's what most people do.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.010
You know, a lot of families and stuff.

27:58.010 --> 28:02.100
- But if you wanna go 127
hours, like slot canyon crazy,

28:02.100 --> 28:02.933
I could tell you--

28:02.933 --> 28:03.966
- Uh no no no no no.

28:03.966 --> 28:05.300
No 127 hours action.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.523
I'm good with flat families.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.283
- The Narrow's still pretty awesome.

28:10.283 --> 28:12.290
Just go to the visitors center

28:12.290 --> 28:13.350
and there are shuttles to take you

28:13.350 --> 28:14.810
to the Narrows trailhead.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.730
- Cool, thanks, I'll do that.

28:16.730 --> 28:19.090
You guys on vacation or something?

28:19.090 --> 28:20.700
- Oh yeah, we're buds from high school.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.240
We try to do one of these trips every year

28:22.240 --> 28:23.073
when we get a break.

28:23.073 --> 28:25.230
- Or at least until one
of us gets a real job.

28:25.230 --> 28:27.268
- Yeah, I remember those days.

28:27.268 --> 28:30.810
So what kind of real job
you guys looking for?

28:30.810 --> 28:32.281
- Well I don't think we know yet, right?

28:32.281 --> 28:34.210
We're just trying to
explore as much as we can

28:34.210 --> 28:36.920
until we find something
to be excited about.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.945
- Yeah, it's cool.

28:37.945 --> 28:39.980
- Back when I was in college,

28:39.980 --> 28:41.527
I was the same way guys were, you know.

28:41.527 --> 28:43.270
Get out of school, I was all fired up

28:43.270 --> 28:45.290
to go change the world, you know,

28:45.290 --> 28:47.210
and do something cool.

28:47.210 --> 28:48.550
- Yeah?

28:48.550 --> 28:49.900
So what'd you end up doing?

28:51.210 --> 28:54.647
- Well, I guess, instead
I became an accountant.

28:54.647 --> 28:55.780
(laughing)

28:55.780 --> 28:57.360
- All right, so accounting was your thing

28:57.360 --> 28:58.463
to be excited about?

28:59.730 --> 29:01.440
- Uh, actually I don't know.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.500
I mean ever since it was a great job

29:05.500 --> 29:08.430
and I was good at it, but,

29:08.430 --> 29:10.620
I guess even if you're good at something

29:10.620 --> 29:12.409
you don't always love it, right?

29:12.409 --> 29:13.383
- Right.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.050
- Well you're here now, right?

29:19.050 --> 29:19.883
- Yeah.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.100
- Are you ready for
adventure and natural wonder?

29:22.100 --> 29:23.560
- Yeah, you know what, I think I am.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.540
Hearing you guys talk about it

29:24.540 --> 29:26.010
I think I'm getting all psyched up

29:26.010 --> 29:27.268
to go hike the Narrows.

29:27.268 --> 29:28.930
- Bravo.
- There we go.

29:28.930 --> 29:29.800
See you there.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.780
- Thanks.

29:30.780 --> 29:32.190
- Yeah so what kind of shoes do you have

29:32.190 --> 29:33.310
to hike the narrows?

29:33.310 --> 29:35.440
- Oh, well I just brought these.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.273
Is this cool?

29:37.400 --> 29:39.500
- Oh, yeah, those aren't gonna do it, man.

29:54.153 --> 29:57.716
- [Woman] Right now it's about 9:30.

29:57.716 --> 30:00.216
(light music)

30:15.843 --> 30:18.760
(crowd chattering)

30:44.773 --> 30:46.335
- Oh, excuse me.

30:46.335 --> 30:49.387
Do you know where the
trail for the Narrows is?

30:49.387 --> 30:50.603
- You're looking at it.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.700
- [Amelia] The Narrows, baby.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.370
An easy hike to the entrance

31:18.370 --> 31:21.370
of some of the most gorgeous
towering walls of rock

31:21.370 --> 31:23.320
you'll ever see in the world.

31:23.320 --> 31:25.830
The hike is both amazing and fun

31:25.830 --> 31:27.710
which is why I think you'll love it.

31:27.710 --> 31:30.610
Because how often do you
get to hike in the water?

31:30.610 --> 31:33.070
Okay, so it's a little
too popular with tourists

31:33.070 --> 31:35.400
for my taste, but there's nothing like it.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.221
And you can hike for miles
as long as you can stand

31:37.221 --> 31:38.720
because it's all flat.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.250
The further out you hike,
the less people there will be

31:41.250 --> 31:43.180
and the more awesome it gets.

31:43.180 --> 31:45.560
Best of all, there aren't any places

31:45.560 --> 31:48.830
you can get trapped and have
to cut off your arm to escape.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.090
Easy adventure.

31:50.090 --> 31:51.900
Just hike in the water for a ways

31:51.900 --> 31:54.380
and then it hits you.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.260
You look up and you're thinking,

31:56.260 --> 31:58.950
oh my god, these walls.

31:58.950 --> 32:00.663

If you're watching this,
that means you made it.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.860
Oh my god!

35:21.860 --> 35:23.610
That is so awesome.

35:23.610 --> 35:27.020
Okay, admit it.

35:27.020 --> 35:30.042
Once you got out into the
water and into the Narrows

35:30.042 --> 35:33.590
it blew you away, right?

35:33.590 --> 35:35.470
Anyway, man.

35:35.470 --> 35:39.410
It was really damn funny
to see you open my letter.

35:39.410 --> 35:42.660
Okay, look, I hacked into
the company mainframe

35:42.660 --> 35:45.789
and I turned on your webcam.

35:45.789 --> 35:50.789
Eh, bet you think I could do
that shit, huh? (laughing)

35:51.720 --> 35:55.149
Dude, the look on your
face, you were like, what?

35:55.149 --> 35:56.330
What's happening?

35:56.330 --> 35:58.970
So confused. (laughing)

35:58.970 --> 36:01.023
Oh god, it was priceless, it really was.

36:03.085 --> 36:05.010
(sighing)

36:05.010 --> 36:08.610
Well, I chose the Narrows first

36:08.610 --> 36:11.650
because I knew there would
be other people around

36:11.650 --> 36:15.848
so you wouldn't feel all scared
getting into the water alone

36:15.848 --> 36:17.553
like the wuss that you are.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.410
But the next place you have to find

36:21.410 --> 36:23.920
won't have as many people, okay?

36:23.920 --> 36:28.290
It'll just be you and mother nature.

36:28.290 --> 36:32.460
I want you to be a traveler,
not a tourist, okay?

36:32.460 --> 36:35.130
Okay, keep going.

36:35.130 --> 36:36.424
For me.

36:36.424 --> 36:37.257

remind you about the big

37:53.980 --> 37:55.800
BDT meeting with the Koreans tomorrow.

37:55.800 --> 37:58.060
I want you to meet Gary Nardino.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.104
He's the VPE on the account.

38:00.104 --> 38:02.950

Oh, I think I'm coming

38:06.959 --> 38:09.430
- Yeah, yeah, just you
know, it's a little fever,

38:09.430 --> 38:11.160
maybe a little vomit, no big deal.

38:11.160 --> 38:11.993
But I should be there, right?

38:11.993 --> 38:14.370

38:14.370 --> 38:16.790
Go get well, away from

38:16.790 --> 38:18.264
Don't take us all down with you.

38:18.264 --> 38:19.097

38:19.097 --> 38:21.100
- Ah I guess taking
your first personal days

38:21.100 --> 38:23.610
in a couple years must have
your defenses down, huh?

38:23.610 --> 38:24.490
- Yeah.

38:24.490 --> 38:26.460
Wait, has it really been a couple years?

38:26.460 --> 38:28.280
- [Tanner] Yeah I'm putting
your sick days in now

38:28.280 --> 38:29.400
and that's what it looks like.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.020

38:32.020 --> 38:33.687

40:10.300 --> 40:11.651
- Yeah, you're in the wild west now,

40:11.651 --> 40:12.600
you gotta get with the lingo.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.460
- All right.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.030
Um, you know, I'll just
have the chicken plate.

40:16.030 --> 40:16.863
- Chicken?

40:17.910 --> 40:19.080
Really, okay.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.470
- What, is there something
wrong with the chicken?

40:20.470 --> 40:22.510
- No, no, chicken's cool.

40:22.510 --> 40:26.490
It's just like you seem like
a man of adventure, you know.

40:26.490 --> 40:28.620
Think you'd want something
a little more flavor,

40:28.620 --> 40:32.094
but do you, chicken it is.

40:32.094 --> 40:32.927
- All right, all right.

40:32.927 --> 40:34.654
You sound like my friend
that dragged me in here.

40:34.654 --> 40:36.153
- Yeah?

40:36.153 --> 40:37.803
Your imaginary friend?

40:38.670 --> 40:40.970
- Oh, well never mind,

40:40.970 --> 40:41.803
it's something like that.

40:41.803 --> 40:43.970
Actually maybe you could help me.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.290
Do you know what this place is?

40:45.290 --> 40:49.430
I know it's like in
Death Valley somewhere.

40:49.430 --> 40:51.700
- Ah, it looks like Sidewinder canyon,

40:51.700 --> 40:53.200
it's near Morland point.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.760
It's super cool, it's like a great hike,

40:54.760 --> 40:56.100
there's lots of slot canyons.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.290
Not many people know about it.

40:57.290 --> 40:58.310
- Slot canyons?

40:58.310 --> 41:00.550
Like the movie 127 hours?

41:00.550 --> 41:01.520
- Yeah.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.260
Well, no, kind of.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.100
It's more like more rocky

41:05.100 --> 41:08.050
so it's like Land of the Lost.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.740
- No, no, I mean is it someplace

41:09.740 --> 41:11.143
where I'm gonna get trapped
and have to cut my arm off

41:11.143 --> 41:12.320
with a pen?

41:12.320 --> 41:13.290
- No, dummy.

41:13.290 --> 41:15.410
That like never happens.

41:15.410 --> 41:16.850
Like almost never.

41:16.850 --> 41:20.040
Look, it's super nice, it's fine.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.070
If it rains, it's bad

41:21.070 --> 41:23.230
but it's not gonna rain anytime soon.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.200
Wait, did you get my Land
of the Lost reference?

41:25.200 --> 41:26.628
- Um, yeah.

41:26.628 --> 41:29.624
Land of the Lost, Sleestak, Chaka.

41:29.624 --> 41:30.741
- Whoah.

41:30.741 --> 41:31.574
- What?

41:31.574 --> 41:33.860
- You're, I didn't
realize you were that old.

41:33.860 --> 41:35.940
Okay, I'm gonna go put in
your boring chicken order.

41:35.940 --> 41:37.660
- Uh, wait wait!

41:37.660 --> 41:39.520
How exactly do you get there?

41:39.520 --> 41:41.890
- It's just off of a dirt
road off of Badwater.

41:41.890 --> 41:44.070
If you hit Morland Point
you've gone too far.

41:44.070 --> 41:45.210
- Seems a little vague.

41:45.210 --> 41:47.310
- Yeah dude, I'm not the visitor's center.

41:50.060 --> 41:51.390
- Wait.

41:51.390 --> 41:54.530
Actually, maybe I won't have the chicken.

41:54.530 --> 41:57.900
- Oh, okay, well then I
have three words for you.

41:57.900 --> 41:59.690
Three mushroom pizza.

41:59.690 --> 42:02.090
Shiitake, portabello, button.

42:02.090 --> 42:05.380
Four types of cheese, little
tomato sauce, hint of garlic.

42:05.380 --> 42:06.520
- Yeah it does sound good.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.636
- [Waitress] Yeah.

42:07.636 --> 42:08.469
- I mean it sounds wild!

42:08.469 --> 42:10.184
- (laughing) Yeah it's wild.

42:10.184 --> 42:11.017
Cool.

42:15.069 --> 42:16.610
- Do you know if there's any
vacancies in the hotel tonight?

42:16.610 --> 42:19.120
- Actually there normally
is but there's not tonight.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.360
They're kind of booked up.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.840
But me and a bunch of friends

42:21.840 --> 42:23.410
are gonna go camping under the stars.

42:23.410 --> 42:24.480
You're welcome to join us.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.824
- Camping?

42:25.824 --> 42:26.810
You mean like on the desert

42:26.810 --> 42:28.806
with like the sand and the cacti?

42:28.806 --> 42:29.639
- Yeah.

42:29.639 --> 42:32.720
- Yeah, sorry, that's not my thing.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.843
- Okay, cool.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.933
Enjoy your boring night.

42:48.801 --> 42:51.051
(grunting)

42:56.372 --> 42:58.050
(knocking)

42:58.050 --> 42:59.492

42:59.492 --> 43:00.992

44:19.540 --> 44:20.373
- Ah.

44:21.460 --> 44:23.180
Yes!

44:23.180 --> 44:24.610
This is why I dragged my ass

44:24.610 --> 44:27.730
all the way out here from Chicago.

44:27.730 --> 44:29.152
- Seriously, Chicago?

44:29.152 --> 44:29.985
- Mhmm, yeah.

44:29.985 --> 44:32.135
- [Joe] What inspired
you to come out here?

44:33.620 --> 44:36.899
- Well you know how Chicago's
just like big time metropolis?

44:36.899 --> 44:41.750
Well like the rest of Illinois
is kind of like farm land

44:41.750 --> 44:45.530
and backcountry roads and stuff like that

44:45.530 --> 44:46.930
but I've never seen any of it.

44:46.930 --> 44:49.730
Like being this city girl.

44:49.730 --> 44:52.310
So then when I went to college
I started dating this guy

44:52.310 --> 44:54.890
and he was like super outdoorsy.

44:54.890 --> 44:57.838
So one day he's like, we
should get out of here.

44:57.838 --> 44:59.100
We should like get out of the city.

44:59.100 --> 45:01.180
So we did, we got in his car

45:01.180 --> 45:03.850
and we drive like miles
and miles out of the city.

45:03.850 --> 45:06.650
And he pulls over to the side of the road,

45:06.650 --> 45:08.220
and we're like away from
all the street lights

45:08.220 --> 45:10.850
and everything so it's like pitch black.

45:10.850 --> 45:12.540
And we get out the car

45:12.540 --> 45:16.993
and we sit on the roof and
he tells me to look up.

45:18.170 --> 45:21.493
So I look up and,

45:22.900 --> 45:27.660
it's just stars everywhere.

45:27.660 --> 45:28.860
You know, it's just like

45:29.720 --> 45:32.480
thousands and thousands of stars

45:32.480 --> 45:35.120
and they're all in like
bunches and clusters

45:35.120 --> 45:36.680
and I'd never seen anything like that,

45:36.680 --> 45:38.560
like not in real life.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.970
I don't know, it's like,

45:39.970 --> 45:41.760
it makes you feel really small

45:42.850 --> 45:43.830
and it also makes you feel like

45:43.830 --> 45:47.210
there's just like so
much out there, you know?

45:47.210 --> 45:49.990
Like so much to see and so much to do

45:51.075 --> 45:53.370
and it kind of just gave me scope.

45:53.370 --> 45:55.139
You know what I mean?

45:55.139 --> 45:56.306
- Uh, kind of?

45:57.920 --> 46:00.370
- I mean just like look
up and then you'd get it.

46:04.300 --> 46:06.063
- Holy crap.

46:07.640 --> 46:08.473
- Yeah.

46:12.153 --> 46:13.637
- Huh.
- Yeah.

46:13.637 --> 46:17.010
But from then on I just
wanted to see the stars.

46:17.010 --> 46:18.660
Yeah so when I was done with college

46:18.660 --> 46:20.900
and I packed up all my stuff

46:20.900 --> 46:23.790
and I borrowed my uncle's
like beat up old Civic

46:23.790 --> 46:25.793
and I just drove straight out there.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.290
Like it gets hot as hell out here,

46:29.290 --> 46:31.970
don't get me wrong, it's
like unbearable sometimes.

46:31.970 --> 46:34.220
But it's still beautiful.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.440
- That's cool.

46:35.440 --> 46:37.410
So you meet a lot of weirdos like me?

46:37.410 --> 46:40.000
- Oh yeah, whole lot of weirdos.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.290
You're not the weirdest so you
don't have to worry about it.

46:42.290 --> 46:43.518
- That's good, that's good.

46:43.518 --> 46:45.130
I feel a little better about myself.

46:45.130 --> 46:46.610
- You're close but
you're not the weirdest.

46:46.610 --> 46:47.699
- All right.

46:47.699 --> 46:48.532
(laughing)

46:48.532 --> 46:49.365
Just not the worst.

46:49.365 --> 46:50.220
- No.
- All right.

46:51.197 --> 46:53.120
- You know the strangest thing is that

46:53.120 --> 46:55.570
most of the people that come out here

46:55.570 --> 46:58.660
aren't Americans, they're
foreigners, you know.

46:58.660 --> 46:59.730
Like I think about some of the kids

46:59.730 --> 47:01.450
that I grew up with in my neighborhood,

47:01.450 --> 47:04.200
how much it would benefit them to just

47:04.200 --> 47:06.683
get out, you know and
see that there's more.

47:08.690 --> 47:11.600
- Well, I'm one of those
non-visiting Americans, I guess.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.163
I mean, up until this week.

47:14.600 --> 47:15.580
You know this is my first time camping?

47:15.580 --> 47:17.416
- Oh really?

47:17.416 --> 47:18.910
Ah, I couldn't tell.

47:18.910 --> 47:20.240
- It's that obvious, huh?

47:20.240 --> 47:21.357
I don't know.

47:21.357 --> 47:25.150
I love watching all these outdoor shows

47:25.150 --> 47:26.630
and all that kind of stuff so

47:27.640 --> 47:30.320
always wanted to try it and I just,

47:30.320 --> 47:31.810
life just got busy.

47:31.810 --> 47:34.890
You know, just studied all through college

47:34.890 --> 47:38.310
and then went straight to work afterwards

47:38.310 --> 47:42.003
then got married, had a kid,

47:43.670 --> 47:45.420
and I thought everything was great.

47:47.256 --> 47:48.089
And then,

47:53.416 --> 47:55.656
then I got divorced.

47:55.656 --> 47:57.113
- That sucks, I'm sorry.

47:58.860 --> 47:59.693
- Yeah.

48:00.970 --> 48:03.653
I just didn't feel like going
anywhere after that, you know.

48:03.653 --> 48:07.780
It's just easier, safer

48:09.320 --> 48:13.143
to just stay at work, go back home,

48:14.140 --> 48:17.483
go to bed, go back to work.

48:19.260 --> 48:23.920
- Oh my god dude, you are
bumming me out. (laughing)

48:23.920 --> 48:25.923
- Sorry.
- I feel so bad.

48:29.592 --> 48:30.509
- You know?

48:31.980 --> 48:33.540
I'm having fun.

48:33.540 --> 48:35.176
- You are?

48:35.176 --> 48:36.009
- Yeah.

48:36.856 --> 48:37.689
- Whoah.

48:38.620 --> 48:40.150
We did it!

48:40.150 --> 48:42.130
Mr. Adventure time.

48:42.130 --> 48:43.400
- Yeah.

48:43.400 --> 48:47.130
- Okay, you gotta shut up
'cause I'm gonna go to bed.

48:47.130 --> 48:47.983
Good night.

48:49.853 --> 48:50.936
- Good night.

You start in this scaping, rocky canyon

51:31.830 --> 51:34.180
straight out of Tatooine from Star Wars.

51:34.180 --> 51:35.530

52:07.700 --> 52:10.970
and then a little ways off the side,

52:10.970 --> 52:14.250
there's this small hole in the boulders.

52:14.250 --> 52:17.373
It's the Alice in Wonderland rabbit hole.

- Hello, Joe.

55:31.520 --> 55:34.490
If this is actually Joe.

55:34.490 --> 55:36.340
Oh god, and not some German tourist

55:36.340 --> 55:39.943
who has actually stumbled
upon this video on my SD card.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.963
Well, (speaking in foreign
language) if it is.

55:45.310 --> 55:50.060
But if it's indeed my
Asian American friend Joe

55:50.060 --> 55:53.650
then damn, I can't believe
you made it this far.

55:53.650 --> 55:54.483
Can you?

55:55.840 --> 55:56.940
Stop rolling your eyes at me.

55:56.940 --> 55:58.680
I know that's what you're doing.

55:58.680 --> 56:03.680
I mean, these slot canyons
are pretty sick, right?

56:05.879 --> 56:07.403
Yeah.

56:08.420 --> 56:11.500
And all you had to do was
just hike a little bit

56:11.500 --> 56:13.650
and climb into a hole

56:13.650 --> 56:16.483
and you are in a totally different world.

56:17.790 --> 56:20.963
I know, I love coming out to this canyon.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.150
In the middle of nowhere with its rocks

56:26.150 --> 56:29.363
and its shade and its silence.

56:31.640 --> 56:36.640
It just helps me let go of my burdens.

56:38.750 --> 56:41.480
I think that's what I
like about the desert.

56:41.480 --> 56:45.160
I like staring out into the distance

56:45.160 --> 56:50.160
and hearing old dramatic
Star Wars music in my head.

56:53.120 --> 56:53.953
Yeah.

56:56.530 --> 56:57.363
But you made it!

56:58.780 --> 57:00.530
You made it!

57:00.530 --> 57:03.780
You got out of that building, out of town,

57:03.780 --> 57:05.470
out of your safe zone.

57:05.470 --> 57:06.303
Joe!

57:07.180 --> 57:10.417
(laughing) I'm so proud of you.

57:10.417 --> 57:12.667
(coughing)

57:20.396 --> 57:23.810
Yeah.

57:23.810 --> 57:27.153
You're not the only reason
I decided to disappear.

57:32.080 --> 57:34.010
I'll tell you more later

57:34.010 --> 57:35.550
'cause there's still one more place

57:35.550 --> 57:37.100
I want you to find me at.

57:37.100 --> 57:41.790
But I need you to find
my sister first, okay?

57:41.790 --> 57:44.143
She lives kind of near here.

57:46.130 --> 57:49.570
Find her, tell her I love her

57:50.550 --> 57:53.423
and I forgive her.

57:54.900 --> 57:56.210
And I understand.

57:57.249 --> 57:58.082
Okay?

57:59.070 --> 58:00.120
Talk to her about me.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.883
And then come find me.

58:06.577 --> 58:07.727
Have a great hike back.

58:16.815 --> 58:17.815
- All right.

58:32.453 --> 58:34.620
(howling)

58:44.979 --> 58:47.479
(bird cawing)

58:50.193 --> 58:52.776
(owls hooting)

59:35.184 --> 59:37.767
(upbeat music)

59:44.518 --> 59:47.185
(phone ringing)

59:53.590 --> 59:55.070
- Hello?

59:55.070 --> 59:57.570
- [Joyce] Hey Joe, did you
get my text last night?

59:58.770 --> 1:00:00.310
- Yeah, yeah, sorry, I couldn't get to it.

1:00:00.310 --> 1:00:03.410
- Look, I really need to do this thing

1:00:03.410 --> 1:00:05.908
so are you gonna be back tonight?

1:00:05.908 --> 1:00:07.877
- Uh no, no.

1:00:07.877 --> 1:00:08.803
I'm not, sorry.

1:00:09.670 --> 1:00:12.100
- Oh, really, okay look

1:00:12.100 --> 1:00:13.780
I might be able to push this
thing to tomorrow night,

1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:15.550
are you at least gonna be back then?

1:00:15.550 --> 1:00:18.929
- Uh, yeah, I guess maybe I might be able

1:00:18.929 --> 1:00:19.762
to make it tomorrow night.

1:00:19.762 --> 1:00:20.595
- Okay, that'll be awesome, Joe.

1:00:20.595 --> 1:00:22.350
Let me just make a call
and we'll see what we can--

1:00:22.350 --> 1:00:24.170
- You know what, I can't.

1:00:24.170 --> 1:00:25.390
I'm sorry, I can't, Joyce.

1:00:25.390 --> 1:00:26.609
I can't make it tomorrow night.

1:00:26.609 --> 1:00:27.460
Can you just get a sitter or something?

1:00:27.460 --> 1:00:29.660
- Come on Joe, help me out.

1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:31.310
It's really important.

1:00:31.310 --> 1:00:33.030
- Yeah, don't you think what I'm doing

1:00:33.030 --> 1:00:34.410
is important too, Joyce?

1:00:34.410 --> 1:00:36.708
I mean last three or
four times you asked me

1:00:36.708 --> 1:00:37.953
I've been more than happy to take Wilson,

1:00:37.953 --> 1:00:40.069
I mean cut me a little slack here, okay?

1:00:40.069 --> 1:00:42.493
- [Joyce] God Joe, fine, calm down.

1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:45.497
What's going on that's so important?

1:00:47.387 --> 1:00:48.220
- I...

1:00:58.250 --> 1:00:59.663
- [Joyce] Joe, are you still there?

1:01:03.810 --> 1:01:08.593
- Uh, Joyce, can you tell
me again why you left me?

1:01:09.539 --> 1:01:11.220
- [Joyce] Seriously?

1:01:11.220 --> 1:01:13.420
We've been through this a million times.

1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:17.603
- I know, but, this time I
think I'm ready to listen.

1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:23.040
- [Joyce] Well, look, when we got married,

1:01:23.040 --> 1:01:26.720
I was happy, it's
absolutely what I wanted,

1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:28.190
what we wanted.

1:01:28.190 --> 1:01:33.190
I needed your kindness and
your humor and your stability.

1:01:34.936 --> 1:01:35.769
- Okay.

1:01:38.110 --> 1:01:43.110
- [Joyce] But then things
slowly changed for me.

1:01:45.315 --> 1:01:47.530
And when you went on that
business trip to Korea

1:01:47.530 --> 1:01:50.450
and when you got back, I realized

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.943
I was happier without you.

1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:57.593
- Right.

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.467
Yeah, that was it.

1:02:00.467 --> 1:02:02.060
- [Joyce] I'm sorry, Joe.

1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:04.900
I've always been sorry
about that, honestly.

1:02:04.900 --> 1:02:06.693
- Yeah, I know, I know Joyce.

1:02:08.610 --> 1:02:11.000
Look, I have this work conference I'm at

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.890
so I just can't get out, sorry.

1:02:13.890 --> 1:02:16.020
- [Joyce] Oh, okay.

1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:19.330
Just tell me that next time.

1:02:19.330 --> 1:02:22.817
- Yeah, yeah I just
wasn't thinking straight.

1:02:22.817 --> 1:02:24.320
- [Joyce] All right, I guess I'll just

1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:25.620
figure something else out.

1:02:27.918 --> 1:02:29.400
All right, bye.

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:30.233
- Bye.

1:02:47.141 --> 1:02:49.724
(car starting)

1:02:56.997 --> 1:02:59.497
(light music)

1:03:34.949 --> 1:03:35.952
- Hey there.

1:03:35.952 --> 1:03:37.632
- Hey, how you doing?

1:03:37.632 --> 1:03:42.632
- No, how you doing?
(laughing and snorting)

1:03:44.010 --> 1:03:45.813
I'm sorry, have you
seen the show "Friends"?

1:03:45.813 --> 1:03:48.790
- Yeah, I know, that's Joey.

1:03:48.790 --> 1:03:49.623
He's funny.

1:03:50.540 --> 1:03:52.200
- Can I help you find something?

1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:55.003
- Uh, actually, um,

1:03:56.933 --> 1:03:58.923
do you know someone named Amelia?

1:04:03.150 --> 1:04:04.465
- Why?

1:04:04.465 --> 1:04:07.973
- Because I think she sent me to find you.

1:04:12.980 --> 1:04:13.823
- Excuse me.

1:04:14.681 --> 1:04:15.514
- Okay.

1:04:32.180 --> 1:04:33.887
- Hi, can I help you find something?

1:04:33.887 --> 1:04:37.200
- Yeah, I was just looking for the woman

1:04:37.200 --> 1:04:38.340
that was just over here.

1:04:38.340 --> 1:04:39.173
- What woman?

1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:42.930
- There's a woman that was
working in the aisle over there.

1:04:42.930 --> 1:04:45.130
- Yeah, I'm the only
woman working here, so.

1:04:49.563 --> 1:04:50.710
- All right, look,

1:04:50.710 --> 1:04:52.690
I just needed to talk
to her about her sister.

1:04:52.690 --> 1:04:53.680
This is really important.

1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:55.480
- It sounds important, but if you're not

1:04:55.480 --> 1:04:58.080
buying anything here you
should probably just leave.

1:05:02.630 --> 1:05:04.243
- Okay, all right, fine.

1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:16.913
Oh.

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:23.793
Okay.

1:05:26.956 --> 1:05:28.903
Hey, Amelia's sister.

1:05:29.770 --> 1:05:31.340
- Oh my god, are you stalking me?

1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:32.213
- Well, no no,

1:05:32.213 --> 1:05:34.410
well I guess technically
that's what I'm doing

1:05:34.410 --> 1:05:35.970
but it's not like that.

1:05:35.970 --> 1:05:37.033
Come on, wait, wait.

1:05:38.430 --> 1:05:41.700
Look, Amelia and I are office friends.

1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:44.136
I mean we hang out a lot together at work

1:05:44.136 --> 1:05:46.980
and like a few weeks
ago she just disappeared

1:05:46.980 --> 1:05:48.914
and no one knows where she went

1:05:48.914 --> 1:05:50.743
and then she sent me a message saying

1:05:50.743 --> 1:05:52.443
that you might be able to help me.

1:05:53.816 --> 1:05:56.250
(sighing) Okay.

1:05:56.250 --> 1:05:57.920
Thanks for stopping.

1:05:57.920 --> 1:05:59.120
- I didn't stop for you.

1:06:00.168 --> 1:06:02.013
I'm kind of winded from walking so fast.

1:06:03.773 --> 1:06:04.606
- Oh, sorry.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:11.040
Look, I know it's kind
of awkward and weird

1:06:12.264 --> 1:06:15.210
and I know Amelia's probably
laughing her ass off

1:06:15.210 --> 1:06:17.233
because she set this whole thing up, but,

1:06:18.530 --> 1:06:20.903
I'm her friend, I'm
just worried about her.

1:06:22.728 --> 1:06:25.378
I just wanna find her and
get back to work, you know?

1:06:26.953 --> 1:06:28.700
I just came a long way, is there any way

1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:31.247
you might be able to help me?

1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:35.720
- I don't even know if there's
anything I can do to help.

1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:37.620
I mean Amelia and I, we kind of had a,

1:06:38.930 --> 1:06:42.363
a falling out and I haven't
talked to her in months.

1:06:44.968 --> 1:06:46.768
- Well, any idea where she might be?

1:06:47.966 --> 1:06:48.799
- I don't know.

1:06:50.088 --> 1:06:52.838
I mean I know she's been
doing a lot of traveling, and,

1:06:58.429 --> 1:06:59.709
- Oh my god, are you,

1:06:59.709 --> 1:07:01.997
is there something I
said, I'm sorry, I didn't.

1:07:04.610 --> 1:07:05.893
Look, um.

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:08.283
You wanna just walk?

1:07:10.540 --> 1:07:11.970
Okay.

1:07:11.970 --> 1:07:12.970
Go ahead, I'll just.

1:07:28.580 --> 1:07:32.640
- Um, this is my place.

1:07:32.640 --> 1:07:33.473
- Oh.

1:07:34.377 --> 1:07:35.213
Okay.

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:39.283
Well, nice meeting you.

1:07:40.916 --> 1:07:42.713
And sorry for the trouble.

1:07:48.541 --> 1:07:49.713
- Wait.

1:07:52.010 --> 1:07:55.253
Wait, I think I'm ready to talk now.

1:07:56.270 --> 1:07:57.690
- Yeah?

1:07:57.690 --> 1:07:58.523
- Come in.

1:08:00.150 --> 1:08:00.983
- Okay.

1:08:02.290 --> 1:08:04.690
- My names Helena, by the way.

1:08:04.690 --> 1:08:07.620
- Oh, I'm Joe.

1:08:07.620 --> 1:08:09.233
- [Helena] All right, hurry up, Joe.

1:08:11.983 --> 1:08:14.023
♪ Yeah yeah yeah ♪

1:08:14.023 --> 1:08:17.743
♪ Yeah yeah yeah ayo ♪

1:08:17.743 --> 1:08:22.743
♪ Ayo yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪

1:08:23.681 --> 1:08:27.659

1:08:27.659 --> 1:08:32.659

1:08:32.982 --> 1:08:36.190
♪ Ayo ayo yeah yeah yeah ♪

1:08:36.190 --> 1:08:37.750
- I motion her to stop

1:08:37.750 --> 1:08:38.617
and she like looks over at me

1:08:38.617 --> 1:08:40.140
and she accidentally spills the coffee

1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:43.270
into his lap, like
where his groin area is.

1:08:43.270 --> 1:08:44.750
So she's like grabbing agendas,

1:08:44.750 --> 1:08:46.460
she's trying to wipe it off.

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:47.293
He's being gracious about it,

1:08:47.293 --> 1:08:48.990
he's like "Oh, it's okay, it's okay."

1:08:48.990 --> 1:08:50.687
And suddenly she just steps back and says

1:08:50.687 --> 1:08:53.162
"Oh my god, did I just touch your thing?"

1:08:53.162 --> 1:08:54.199
It was dead quiet.

1:08:54.199 --> 1:08:55.204
- In front of everybody?

1:08:55.204 --> 1:08:56.442
- [Joe] Everybody, it's crazy.

1:08:56.442 --> 1:08:57.420
- She called it a thing?
- Yeah.

1:08:57.420 --> 1:09:01.510
- Oh Amelia, she's so weird and so sweet

1:09:01.510 --> 1:09:02.660
at the same time.

1:09:03.924 --> 1:09:05.530
My god.

1:09:05.530 --> 1:09:07.044
Holy crap, it's getting late.

1:09:07.044 --> 1:09:07.877
- Yeah?

1:09:07.877 --> 1:09:09.183
- I gotta do something.

1:09:10.090 --> 1:09:10.923
- Okay.

1:09:12.339 --> 1:09:14.623
- And you should come with me.

1:09:15.510 --> 1:09:17.523
Don't think, just follow, let's go.

1:09:18.630 --> 1:09:20.733
- Um, okay.

1:09:22.590 --> 1:09:24.560
- So I was never really around for Amelia

1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:25.543
when she was a kid.

1:09:26.570 --> 1:09:30.720
But then after college, she contacted me,

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:34.030
we started kind of actually
being sisters for the first time

1:09:34.030 --> 1:09:36.777
talking a lot and hanging out and stuff.

1:09:36.777 --> 1:09:38.360
- That's cool.

1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.630
- Well she talked a lot about doing things

1:09:41.630 --> 1:09:43.420
and seeing the world
and doing all the stuff

1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:44.270
that I got to do.

1:09:44.270 --> 1:09:46.883
But none of that happened.

1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:52.090
I specifically remember
seeing her at Thanksgiving

1:09:52.090 --> 1:09:57.090
and my parents and her
sort of douchebag husband

1:09:57.090 --> 1:09:58.930
were talking about how great her job was

1:09:58.930 --> 1:10:00.800
and how they were gonna get that house

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:02.203
and have the kids, and,

1:10:04.610 --> 1:10:06.490
(sighing)

1:10:06.490 --> 1:10:07.723
She just clammed up.

1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:12.210
Just nodding at everything
that they were saying.

1:10:14.860 --> 1:10:16.480
And I could see it in her eyes

1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:17.630
that she was like this,

1:10:20.510 --> 1:10:22.250
like this cat looking out a window

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:24.000
wishing somebody would let her out.

1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:28.330
It's like she suddenly
realized at that moment

1:10:28.330 --> 1:10:31.359
that she was trapped in a box

1:10:31.359 --> 1:10:32.653
and she couldn't get out.

1:10:33.550 --> 1:10:34.383
- Yeah.

1:10:35.580 --> 1:10:37.720
Yeah I kind of get that.

1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:42.193
- I started to see her getting depressed.

1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:47.360
Like I could literally see her soul

1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:50.293
leaving her a little bit
every time I saw her.

1:10:52.490 --> 1:10:54.780
Yeah so I could tell I
was totally losing her

1:10:54.780 --> 1:10:57.730
so one day I got to her
house early one morning

1:10:57.730 --> 1:10:59.020
before she got to work,

1:10:59.020 --> 1:11:01.713
shoved her in my car
and drove to Yosemite.

1:11:02.830 --> 1:11:05.920
I made her backpack with me on this trail

1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:06.823
and it was just,

1:11:09.163 --> 1:11:11.223
it was just a perfect day.

1:11:11.223 --> 1:11:12.873
- Wow.

1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:16.450
- We hiked through this meadow

1:11:17.500 --> 1:11:20.283
and it was blooming wildflowers.

1:11:21.300 --> 1:11:26.090
And we ended up at this gigantic rock

1:11:26.090 --> 1:11:30.253
overlooking the valley and we slept there.

1:11:32.630 --> 1:11:35.623
And we woke up to the sunrise.

1:11:37.780 --> 1:11:42.567
And it just destroyed her.

1:11:45.223 --> 1:11:46.056
It was awesome.

1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:52.470
And then she ended up wanting to go on

1:11:52.470 --> 1:11:53.800
more and more of these trips

1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:56.643
and I ended up not having
the time to do them.

1:11:58.090 --> 1:12:01.760
- Wow, so actually,

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:03.380
she just wanted to be like you.

1:12:03.380 --> 1:12:06.003
- Hmm, I don't know about that.

1:12:09.430 --> 1:12:13.110
- Uh, why are we at this guesthouse?

1:12:13.110 --> 1:12:15.190
- This is my ex boyfriend's house.

1:12:15.190 --> 1:12:16.023
- What?

1:12:16.023 --> 1:12:17.420
- Yeah, he rents it
out from the old people

1:12:17.420 --> 1:12:18.570
that live in the house.

1:12:19.770 --> 1:12:20.730
- What are you doing?

1:12:20.730 --> 1:12:22.190
- What's it look like I'm doing?

1:12:22.190 --> 1:12:24.082
Can you hand me that
little hammer in there?

1:12:24.082 --> 1:12:25.599
- I don't know if I really want to.

1:12:25.599 --> 1:12:27.260
Why are you breaking into
your ex-boyfriend's house?

1:12:27.260 --> 1:12:28.840
- Well, before we broke up a week ago

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:31.600
because I found out he's a
raging asshole when he drinks,

1:12:31.600 --> 1:12:32.750
I left my wallet in there

1:12:32.750 --> 1:12:35.400
which has my credit cards,
my driver's license,

1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:38.320
a bunch of cash and a
gigantic gift card for Target

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:40.359
from my mom that I cannot lose.

1:12:40.359 --> 1:12:41.960
(tapping)

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:43.530
- Why don't you just ask him for it?

1:12:43.530 --> 1:12:45.130
- Because we broke up!

1:12:45.130 --> 1:12:47.690
I don't wanna talk to him, it's awkward.

1:12:47.690 --> 1:12:50.440
And I may or may not have egged his house

1:12:50.440 --> 1:12:52.803
which he doesn't know
about it, I don't think.

1:12:54.722 --> 1:12:56.834
(gasping)

1:12:56.834 --> 1:12:59.298
(creaking)

1:12:59.298 --> 1:13:00.463
Look at that.

1:13:00.463 --> 1:13:02.430
I'm the female McGyver.

1:13:03.399 --> 1:13:04.820
- More like a female wanted
for breaking and entering.

1:13:04.820 --> 1:13:06.420
- [Helena] Oh whatever, come on.

1:13:15.940 --> 1:13:20.940
- Yeah I think Amelia was
trying to get me out of my box.

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:22.830
Kind of like what you did with her.

1:13:22.830 --> 1:13:24.400
- That's cool.

1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:26.300
Looks like it kind of worked, right?

1:13:26.300 --> 1:13:27.193
- Yeah, kinda.

1:13:29.278 --> 1:13:31.880
- You know, I do think
Amelia talked about you

1:13:31.880 --> 1:13:33.960
a couple times to me.

1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:34.860
- Really?
- Mhmm.

1:13:36.070 --> 1:13:37.538
- She said that there was this guy at work

1:13:37.538 --> 1:13:40.230
who made her laugh a lot

1:13:41.490 --> 1:13:45.803
and she thought that I would
probably really like him.

1:13:47.210 --> 1:13:48.043
- Hmm.

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:56.283
Something happening here?

1:13:57.370 --> 1:13:58.203
- Kind of.

1:14:00.370 --> 1:14:02.170
You're sitting on the
drawers I need to go through.

1:14:02.170 --> 1:14:03.193
- Oh, sorry.

1:14:07.662 --> 1:14:08.840
(gasping)

1:14:08.840 --> 1:14:10.462
- Wallet found.

1:14:10.462 --> 1:14:11.920
- Bravo.

1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:13.720
Now can we get out of here?

1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:15.900
This is the worst lost
and found experience ever.

1:14:15.900 --> 1:14:17.110
- Yes we can.

1:14:17.110 --> 1:14:19.310
But in my excitement, I
may have peed a little

1:14:19.310 --> 1:14:20.740
of the bottle of wine in my pants

1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:23.010
so I'm gonna go to the
bathroom and meet you outside.

1:14:23.010 --> 1:14:24.360
Okay, thanks.

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:25.193
- Okay.

1:14:26.539 --> 1:14:28.293
Too much information.

1:14:34.434 --> 1:14:36.601
(sighing)

1:14:45.358 --> 1:14:46.191
Helena!

1:14:48.310 --> 1:14:49.143
Helena!

1:14:57.502 --> 1:15:00.502
(car door shutting)

1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:05.013
- Jesus!

1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:08.040
Okay, buddy, this is private property,

1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:09.390
so what are you doing here?

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:16.060
- Is this RD&D?

1:15:16.060 --> 1:15:16.893
- What?

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:20.890
- I travel from Shanghai,

1:15:20.890 --> 1:15:23.010
I look for RD&D house.

1:15:23.010 --> 1:15:24.883
Is this RD&D?

1:15:26.250 --> 1:15:27.410
- No.

1:15:27.410 --> 1:15:29.760
I think you mean AirBnB.

1:15:29.760 --> 1:15:30.810
- I don't understand.

1:15:32.190 --> 1:15:33.330
- Never mind, look.

1:15:33.330 --> 1:15:37.740
This guesthouse, my place.

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:39.570
Not AirBnB.

1:15:39.570 --> 1:15:40.403
- Okay.

1:15:41.390 --> 1:15:43.740
So is this Pine street?

1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:46.390
- No, this isn't Pine,
that's two streets down.

1:15:46.390 --> 1:15:49.693
- Oh, so where is this two street?

1:15:51.380 --> 1:15:52.383
- Okay, come.

1:16:07.867 --> 1:16:09.990
Okay, Pine is the next street over.

1:16:09.990 --> 1:16:11.450
- Okay, next street over.

1:16:11.450 --> 1:16:12.821
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:16:12.821 --> 1:16:14.621
Okay, thank you, thank you.
- Yeah.

1:16:15.990 --> 1:16:18.113
- Try using Chinese Google maps next time.

1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:23.300
- God, whatever crazy Chinese accent

1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:24.133
you were doing out there,

1:16:24.133 --> 1:16:26.330
that was straight up racist, dude.

1:16:26.330 --> 1:16:27.787
- Oh come on, I was just imitating my dad.

1:16:27.787 --> 1:16:30.150
- Oh, oh your dad is Long Dick Dong.

1:16:30.150 --> 1:16:31.603
- Oh my god, that is low.

1:16:31.603 --> 1:16:33.280
That is low.

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:36.430
This Chinese diatribe
saved your ass, all right?

1:16:36.430 --> 1:16:37.870
- Okay, he did, he did.

1:16:37.870 --> 1:16:39.643
- That's right, that's right.

1:16:39.643 --> 1:16:41.143
Don't forget that.

1:16:45.230 --> 1:16:47.680
- You know part of me
thinks Amelia sent you here

1:16:47.680 --> 1:16:48.513
to set us up.

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.263
- Well, she failed at that, right?

1:17:29.163 --> 1:17:31.060
Good morning.

1:17:31.060 --> 1:17:31.893
- Hey.

1:17:34.814 --> 1:17:35.647
Did we?

1:17:37.820 --> 1:17:38.653
- Oh come on.

1:17:39.616 --> 1:17:40.449
Isn't it early in the morning

1:17:40.449 --> 1:17:41.530
to be tearing down my manhood?

1:17:43.194 --> 1:17:46.474
- Okay, I'm sort of starting to remember.

1:17:46.474 --> 1:17:47.891
- Oh good, great.

1:17:48.933 --> 1:17:51.590
- I remember somehow
staying connected to you

1:17:51.590 --> 1:17:53.200
from the couch all the way to the bed.

1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:55.133
- Really, that takes skills, man, right?

1:17:55.133 --> 1:17:56.383
- Yeah I guess.

1:17:58.634 --> 1:17:59.467
Ooh.

1:18:00.550 --> 1:18:02.680
You better go.

1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:04.700
My ex just texted me
that he's coming over.

1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:05.930
- What?

1:18:05.930 --> 1:18:07.550
- I'm just kidding.

1:18:07.550 --> 1:18:08.870
- Oh my god.

1:18:08.870 --> 1:18:11.180
You're definitely related to Amelia.

1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:12.520
- You know it.

1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:14.193
Does she make out like me too?

1:18:15.776 --> 1:18:17.963
- Uh, yeah. (coughing)

1:18:19.340 --> 1:18:20.173
- What?

1:18:21.460 --> 1:18:22.293
- Hmm?

1:18:23.613 --> 1:18:25.673
- Oh wait.

1:18:25.673 --> 1:18:26.874
No.

1:18:26.874 --> 1:18:27.707
- What?

1:18:28.997 --> 1:18:31.720
- You little scheming Chinese whore.

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:33.490
You hooked up with her too?

1:18:33.490 --> 1:18:34.753
- No, I did.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:38.200
All right, it wasn't
like that, I mean she,

1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:39.033
I...

1:18:40.370 --> 1:18:42.260
This makes things a
little awkward doesn't it.

1:18:42.260 --> 1:18:43.570
- Yeah.

1:18:43.570 --> 1:18:45.380
God, I didn't know you were such a gigolo.

1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:48.600
- But come on, you didn't think
I planned all this, do you?

1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:51.100
I mean nothing like this
happens to me, like ever.

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:54.390
- I kind of believe that.

1:18:54.390 --> 1:18:56.133
- Okay now I think you're insulting me.

1:18:57.227 --> 1:18:58.060
- [Helena] Who's this?

1:18:58.060 --> 1:19:00.040
- Yeah I'm not sure what it means.

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:02.660
He's the guy that started
the Central Pacific railroad.

1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:04.253
His name is Charles Crocker.

1:19:06.069 --> 1:19:07.750
- Hmm.

1:19:07.750 --> 1:19:09.033
- Does that mean something?

1:19:10.140 --> 1:19:11.493
- Yeah, um.

1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:16.150
That first place that I
took Amelia to in Yosemite?

1:19:16.150 --> 1:19:16.983
- Huh?

1:19:18.430 --> 1:19:19.830
- It's called Crocker Point.

1:19:21.850 --> 1:19:23.883
- Yeah, that makes sense.

1:19:25.290 --> 1:19:27.290
Probably go there first.

1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:30.990
- Hey I gotta get to work soon

1:19:30.990 --> 1:19:33.593
so are you heading out?

1:19:34.490 --> 1:19:36.353
- Oh yeah I think so.

1:19:40.010 --> 1:19:41.903
Uh, hey, um.

1:19:43.072 --> 1:19:44.522
I forgot to tell you this but

1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:50.600
Amelia in her video told me to tell you

1:19:50.610 --> 1:19:53.340
that she understands

1:19:54.410 --> 1:19:56.093
and that she forgives you.

1:20:02.615 --> 1:20:03.448
- Okay.

1:20:07.558 --> 1:20:08.391
- Oh man.

1:20:11.120 --> 1:20:12.500
I think I got you upset again.

1:20:12.500 --> 1:20:14.693
- No, no no it's good.

1:20:17.010 --> 1:20:18.210
I'm happy she said that.

1:20:19.540 --> 1:20:21.183
- Okay, good.

1:20:23.040 --> 1:20:27.410
Hey uh, can I ask you what happened

1:20:27.410 --> 1:20:28.563
between you and Amelia?

1:20:32.330 --> 1:20:33.360
- Um...

1:20:38.200 --> 1:20:41.190
Did she ever tell you that

1:20:42.370 --> 1:20:45.123
years and years ago she got sick?

1:20:46.310 --> 1:20:47.143
- No.

1:20:47.143 --> 1:20:49.070
- This was probably before she met you.

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.290
She had this kind of blood cancer

1:20:54.290 --> 1:20:58.200
and she had some pretty
grueling treatments

1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:00.820
that almost killed her...

1:21:00.820 --> 1:21:04.050
itself. It took a lot out of her

1:21:04.050 --> 1:21:08.290
and it was really painful to watch

1:21:08.290 --> 1:21:10.203
but it went into remission.

1:21:11.362 --> 1:21:13.990
- Oh, okay, wow.

1:21:13.990 --> 1:21:18.040
- And then a couple
months ago she called me

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:21.083
and the cancer came back.

1:21:23.480 --> 1:21:24.870
- Wait, what?

1:21:24.870 --> 1:21:26.200
- Yeah.

1:21:26.200 --> 1:21:28.120
She said she wasn't telling anybody

1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:29.350
because her doctors told her

1:21:29.350 --> 1:21:33.740
that they didn't know how long she had.

1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:36.353
- So there's nothing else
they could do for her?

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.753
- According to Amelia, no.

1:21:39.630 --> 1:21:41.230
They told her to go to hospice

1:21:41.230 --> 1:21:44.030
but she told me that she wasn't,

1:21:44.030 --> 1:21:45.670
she wasn't gonna go down like that.

1:21:45.670 --> 1:21:49.363
She wanted to go out on her own terms.

1:21:50.870 --> 1:21:54.768
She said she wanted to
travel and live life

1:21:54.768 --> 1:21:58.450
and then when she was too tired to do that

1:21:58.450 --> 1:22:01.390
she wanted me to (sighing)

1:22:02.290 --> 1:22:04.240
she wanted me to help her kill herself.

1:22:05.126 --> 1:22:05.959
- Oh god.

1:22:07.661 --> 1:22:09.080
- And I was like no.

1:22:09.080 --> 1:22:10.930
No I'm not gonna do
that, I was gonna give up

1:22:10.930 --> 1:22:13.290
everything that I needed to, quit my job,

1:22:13.290 --> 1:22:15.700
move in with her, fight
until my last breath

1:22:15.700 --> 1:22:18.310
but being part of
killing my little sister,

1:22:18.310 --> 1:22:19.960
you fucking crazy?

1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:21.660
No fucking way.

1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:23.730
No fucking way, you know?

1:22:23.730 --> 1:22:26.400
And then we got into it,
yelling and screaming

1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.697
and crying and then I got so mad at her.

1:22:36.642 --> 1:22:39.290
- So was that the last
time you talked to her?

1:22:39.290 --> 1:22:40.123
- Yeah.

1:22:41.090 --> 1:22:42.560
Yeah we said some pretty hurtful things

1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.633
and then she hung up.

1:22:47.067 --> 1:22:49.217
- Oh man, like what
kind of hurtful things?

1:22:52.890 --> 1:22:56.520
- I may have said that if
that's what she was going to do

1:22:56.520 --> 1:22:58.333
I didn't care if she lived or died.

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:01.060
- Oh man.

1:23:01.060 --> 1:23:02.510
- I didn't mean it like that.

1:23:04.806 --> 1:23:07.653
But that's just how it happened.

1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:17.190
- Jesus, this whole time,
she's been hiding her sickness?

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:21.693
- Goddamn her.

1:23:23.460 --> 1:23:25.760
Why did she have to get
this idea in her head?

1:23:27.227 --> 1:23:29.383
Why is she so set to do it this way?

1:23:33.470 --> 1:23:36.333
It's so stupid, I should
have called back sooner.

1:23:38.848 --> 1:23:41.265
I should have said I'm sorry.

1:23:42.848 --> 1:23:43.848
- It's okay.

1:23:45.784 --> 1:23:46.617
It's okay.

1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:52.787
(sobbing)

1:24:00.536 --> 1:24:02.753
Oh, um, there's some
more photos she sent me

1:24:02.753 --> 1:24:04.020
that I don't recognize.

1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:06.150
Do you know what that place might be?

1:24:06.150 --> 1:24:07.576
- Yeah, actually.

1:24:07.576 --> 1:24:10.220
That's right in front of my apartment.

1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:11.053
- Oh.

1:24:12.291 --> 1:24:14.963
So here?

1:24:20.830 --> 1:24:24.170
- Just so you know, I
may have puked in there

1:24:24.170 --> 1:24:25.520
one time when I was wasted.

1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:27.640
- Yeah well that's probably why Amelia

1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:29.090
is making me dig around here.

1:25:04.348 --> 1:25:05.743
So you wanna come with me?

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:13.433
- I'm scared

1:25:15.009 --> 1:25:16.883
of what we might discover.

1:25:18.269 --> 1:25:19.102
- Yeah.

1:25:21.850 --> 1:25:22.693
- Go find her.

1:25:25.571 --> 1:25:26.404
- Yeah.

- [Amelia] I've been to a lot of places.

1:26:35.710 --> 1:26:38.570
But Yosemite still takes my breath away

1:26:38.570 --> 1:26:40.830
and brings me the most peace.

1:26:40.830 --> 1:26:43.340
Most places here are
crawling with tourists.

1:26:43.340 --> 1:26:46.070
Parking lots, cars, you got a good view

1:26:46.070 --> 1:26:47.910
but ultimately you feel like you're with

1:26:47.910 --> 1:26:52.460
a bunch of people and not with Yosemite.

1:26:52.460 --> 1:26:54.090
Don't get me wrong.

1:26:54.090 --> 1:26:57.670
Seeing Half Dome and El
Capitan close up is incredible

1:26:57.670 --> 1:26:58.750
and a must-do,

1:26:58.750 --> 1:27:03.130
but if you really want
to experience Yosemite,

1:27:03.130 --> 1:27:06.820
you have to go into the
woods and be all by yourself

1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:11.030
so that you can hear the
wind, smell the trees,

1:27:11.030 --> 1:27:14.060
see the gigantic rocks that hum to you.

1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:16.610
That's why this trail is so sweet.

1:27:16.610 --> 1:27:19.130
It's pretty flat with
only a few miles to hike

1:27:19.130 --> 1:27:21.550
so it's just at your grandpa speed.

1:27:21.550 --> 1:27:22.720
And the best thing is,

1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:24.470
most people don't really know about it.

1:27:24.470 --> 1:27:27.490
So with an easy hike you get to be alone

1:27:27.490 --> 1:27:29.653
with some of the best parts of Yosemite.

1:27:30.510 --> 1:27:31.623
The forest,

1:27:35.875 --> 1:27:36.708

1:29:41.290 --> 1:29:45.010
you'll have the most
amazing view all to yourself

1:29:45.010 --> 1:29:48.400
and yet you don't feel alone.

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:52.011
Everything there, the trees,
the giant rocks, the waterfall

1:29:52.011 --> 1:29:55.300
has a presence.

1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:56.763
And they all welcome you.

1:29:57.730 --> 1:30:01.650
As far as hikes go, it's one
of the best deals in the world.

1:30:01.650 --> 1:30:04.663
And one of my favorite places ever.

1:31:13.520 --> 1:31:16.223
Oh my God, Joe, you made
it to Crocker Point.

1:31:18.140 --> 1:31:20.743
How does it feel to be
on top of the world?

1:31:23.270 --> 1:31:26.630
Isn't this the most
amazing view of Yosemite

1:31:26.630 --> 1:31:27.553
you've ever seen?

1:31:29.410 --> 1:31:32.473
And all to yourself. (wheezing)

1:31:34.900 --> 1:31:35.733
Thank you.

1:31:38.210 --> 1:31:40.093
Thank you Joe, for finding me.

1:31:45.194 --> 1:31:47.111
It means so much to me.

1:31:48.950 --> 1:31:51.914
You know you can be a
real pussy sometimes but

1:31:51.914 --> 1:31:53.714
(wheezing) I knew you had it in you.

1:31:56.130 --> 1:31:58.313
I guess that means you met Helena.

1:32:00.210 --> 1:32:01.160
She's great, right?

1:32:02.670 --> 1:32:04.920
I'm guessing she told
you about my condition.

1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:07.013
Yeah.

1:32:07.900 --> 1:32:09.400
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

1:32:12.773 --> 1:32:13.823
I didn't tell anyone.

1:32:16.470 --> 1:32:21.470
Because I needed to deal
with it in my own way

1:32:23.630 --> 1:32:28.630
and I knew that everyone
would screw up their lives

1:32:28.740 --> 1:32:30.163
to try to save me.

1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:38.633
But I'm at peace with it.

1:32:41.013 --> 1:32:41.846
I am.

1:32:44.110 --> 1:32:47.623
I'm not gonna be defined by this disease.

1:32:50.207 --> 1:32:51.300
I hope you understand,

1:32:51.300 --> 1:32:55.470
people knowing would have just
brought me pity and sorrow

1:32:55.470 --> 1:32:56.833
and I don't want that.

1:32:59.070 --> 1:33:02.330
I wanted you to keep talking with me

1:33:03.295 --> 1:33:06.723
and making fun of me like
everything was normal.

1:33:11.030 --> 1:33:13.493
So yeah.

1:33:14.810 --> 1:33:17.410
That's why I've been doing
all this crazy traveling.

1:33:19.194 --> 1:33:21.623
I was literally doing my bucket list.

1:33:23.980 --> 1:33:26.863
And it was wonderful, yeah.

1:33:28.415 --> 1:33:30.665
(coughing)

1:33:42.860 --> 1:33:43.693
Sorry.

1:33:47.470 --> 1:33:50.743
Hiding these coughing
fits were the worst part.

1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:55.890
Sometimes I would just
run into the stairwell

1:33:55.890 --> 1:33:58.650
and cough my ass off for 10 minutes

1:33:59.820 --> 1:34:02.699
then have to walk back into the office

1:34:02.699 --> 1:34:04.532
like nothing happened.

1:34:06.340 --> 1:34:07.970
Eventually it just got so bad

1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:11.530
that I knew I had to leave.

1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:16.970
But I knew there was still
one thing I wanted to do

1:34:18.054 --> 1:34:22.283
and that was to make a
difference in someone's life.

1:34:25.158 --> 1:34:26.633
And that person was you.

1:34:29.010 --> 1:34:31.403
Yeah, that's right, you asshole.

1:34:33.870 --> 1:34:35.270
I knew you kind of liked me.

1:34:37.393 --> 1:34:39.770
Yes I kind of liked you too, old man.

1:34:39.770 --> 1:34:41.720
But you needed to get your groove back.

1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:46.950
So I devised this little plan

1:34:47.890 --> 1:34:50.430
to get you worried about
me, to draw you out

1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:52.913
so you'd come.

1:34:56.416 --> 1:34:57.249
And you did.

1:34:59.860 --> 1:35:00.693
You did.

1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:13.383
I almost didn't make it on the last hike.

1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:20.500
But I took it slow for the last mile and,

1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:25.313
it was all good.

1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:31.180
I guess planning this whole
thing was good for me too

1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:37.820
because I got to hike three
of my most favorite places

1:35:39.980 --> 1:35:40.870
one more time.

1:35:44.470 --> 1:35:49.470
This view is exactly what I
wanna see for the last time.

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:53.113
- Shit.

1:35:58.576 --> 1:36:01.360
Amelia!

1:36:01.360 --> 1:36:02.193
Amelia!

1:36:04.438 --> 1:36:05.271
Amelia!

1:36:13.530 --> 1:36:16.103
- Find more places to explore, Joe.

1:36:18.180 --> 1:36:20.820
Find someone to share your life with.

1:36:20.820 --> 1:36:23.670
I know someone is out
there looking for you.

1:36:23.670 --> 1:36:26.270
I know this because you
have given me so much

1:36:26.270 --> 1:36:29.423
by just being my friend.

1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:37.790
I'll always cherish our good times,

1:36:37.790 --> 1:36:39.283
our laughs and our talks.

1:36:43.250 --> 1:36:44.083
I love you, Joe.

1:36:48.475 --> 1:36:50.975
And I will always be with you.

1:37:14.634 --> 1:37:15.467
- Amelia.

1:37:35.039 --> 1:37:37.206
(sobbing)

1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:15.490
(wheezing)

1:38:40.530 --> 1:38:41.843
Joe's gonna miss Amelia.

1:38:57.862 --> 1:39:00.445
(solemn music)

1:39:37.392 --> 1:39:39.900
- [Wilson] Come on dad,
hurry up, you walk too slow.

1:39:39.900 --> 1:39:42.303
- [Joe] I don't walk too
slow, you walk too fast!

1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:51.270
- Hey, look at that cool rock,

1:39:51.270 --> 1:39:53.154
I'm gonna climb to the top.

1:39:53.154 --> 1:39:54.833
- Wilson, it's a little high.

1:39:54.833 --> 1:39:57.243
Just be careful, all right?

1:40:07.375 --> 1:40:08.208
- Whoah.

1:40:09.170 --> 1:40:11.954
- Yeah, so what do you think?

1:40:11.954 --> 1:40:15.453
- It's awesome, dad, I feel so small.

1:40:16.290 --> 1:40:17.963
- Yeah, me too.

1:40:18.870 --> 1:40:20.900
- Are there more places like this?

1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:23.310
- Yeah, actually my friend
made a whole list of places

1:40:23.310 --> 1:40:24.293
for us to go to.

1:40:29.010 --> 1:40:31.910
Hey, uh, you know there's another view

1:40:31.910 --> 1:40:33.170
further down at Stanford Point,

1:40:33.170 --> 1:40:34.358
wanna go check that out?

1:40:34.358 --> 1:40:35.973
- Yeah!
- All right.

1:40:35.973 --> 1:40:36.806
Okay.

1:40:48.037 --> 1:40:49.954
