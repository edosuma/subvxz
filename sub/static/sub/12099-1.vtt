to take away our little...

10:57.990 --> 10:58.990
I'll get him a sedative.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.992
Good idea, and get
something for yourself.

11:00.993 --> 11:01.960
Yeah.

11:01.961 --> 11:02.961
Mm...

11:02.962 --> 11:04.964

11:08.467 --> 11:11.202
Hi, Ma.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.604
Did I?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.539
You did.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.041
Congratulations.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.476
What color is it?

11:18.477 --> 11:20.912
Wow, is there something

11:20.913 --> 11:22.915
you'd like to tell us?

11:24.417 --> 11:25.917
We're not sure yet.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.919
That's not usually
the first question.

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920

11:28.921 --> 11:31.923
That's not usually

Chuck, why don't you
go get the nurse

11:47.239 --> 11:48.740
and tell her
that Mom's awake, okay?

11:48.741 --> 11:50.241
Okay.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.743
Come on, Bob.

11:51.744 --> 11:52.744
How come you're always saying,

11:52.745 --> 11:53.745
"Come on, Bob"?

12:02.088 --> 12:04.355
Oh, Jodie, I am so scared.

12:04.356 --> 12:06.291
Mom, there's nothing
to worry about.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.226
No matter what the baby is,
you'll love it.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.594
We'll all love it,

12:09.595 --> 12:10.595
and that baby will grow up

12:10.596 --> 12:12.530
and never realize
he's different.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.332
When he starts flying
around the room,

12:14.333 --> 12:17.168
he's gonna want some answers.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.671
He'll belong, Ma.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.106
No, because we'll love him.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.074
We'll all love him,
and you'll see, he'll be normal.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.576
He'll be a pink, little,
bright, pudgy...

12:24.577 --> 12:26.578

12:26.579 --> 12:29.447
Congratulations.
You have a son.

Oh... Jodie.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.419
Oh. Well, where is he?
Can I see him?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.420
Is he all right?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.421
Oh, he's fine.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.423
He's a healthy
9-pound baby boy...

12:38.424 --> 12:39.424
Oh, thank God.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.925
See, what did I tell you?

12:40.926 --> 12:43.161
But we'd like to keep him
in the nursery a bit longer.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.163
We're just a little concerned
about his color.

to your father.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.681
Wait a minute.
I'm in the middle of a sentence.

13:03.682 --> 13:04.682
Well, hurry up and finish it.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.184
How could I think
under pressure like this?

13:06.185 --> 13:07.685
You're just stalling, Billy.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.188
Naturally, I'm stalling. Any
time someone points a gun at me,

13:10.189 --> 13:11.189
I tend to stall.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.690
Okay, that's enough.
One more P.S.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.691
No more P.S.'s.

One last request?

13:14.693 --> 13:15.693
No more last requests.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.195
I've already let you
say your prayers.

13:17.196 --> 13:18.130
I let you have

13:18.131 --> 13:19.564
10 minutes of meditation,

13:19.565 --> 13:21.567
and I let you have
two cups of Ovaltine.

13:22.956 --> 13:25.036
You've taken advantage of
my good nature long enough.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.538
Leslie, think.

13:26.539 --> 13:29.007
If you wanted to shoot me,
you would have done it by now.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.009
Don't kid yourself.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.510
My only reason for delaying

13:32.511 --> 13:35.013
is so that I can
watch you squirm.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.514
Now that you've squirmed...

13:36.515 --> 13:38.016
I've got a lot of squirming
left in me.

13:41.020 --> 13:44.522

Very odd choice
for a combat weapon.

Oh, Grandpa.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.028
Well, everything's screwy

13:50.029 --> 13:53.031
since they let women
into the Army.

or it's K.P.

tougher on her,

this off until tomorrow?

14:10.549 --> 14:12.050
Why don't we sleep on it?

Stop trying to reason
with me, Billy.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.053
I really want to do this.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.054
It'll mean the chair.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.058
Then I'll write a book about it,

14:20.059 --> 14:23.428
then Meryl Streep will star
in the movie version.

to sound like a better idea

to myself

14:37.710 --> 14:39.143
that nothing that happens
in this house

14:39.144 --> 14:41.079
could surprise me.

you could manage

14:45.551 --> 14:46.551
to drive me to the hospital

14:46.552 --> 14:48.519

She said the color...

He's just a little jaundiced.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.368

you were worried,

but that's not what she means.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.546
No.

he's not silver.

Right.

15:52.018 --> 15:55.019
Sure.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.521
Yeah, because she thought

she was gonna have
a silver baby.

There's a good chance.

right between the peepers.

36:04.795 --> 36:06.296
something you should know.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.300
The Red Sea wasn't parted
by a pool pump. Savvy?

36:10.801 --> 36:13.303
When John the Baptist
was to be beheaded,

36:13.304 --> 36:14.804
he didn't stand a chance,

36:14.805 --> 36:17.807
but he made it,
because there's always a chance.

Remember that.

36:18.809 --> 36:21.311
John the Baptist was beheaded.

36:23.147 --> 36:24.648
Then I hope
you'll have the grace

than that ridiculous rug.

apparent to me,

36:53.277 --> 36:54.644
over these many years,

36:54.645 --> 36:56.413
that an infant needs
the kind of care

36:56.414 --> 36:57.747
that can best be given to it

36:57.748 --> 36:58.782
by its mother.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.252
Miss David,
you have shown yourself

37:02.253 --> 37:03.286

that your child

would be better off
with her mother.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.627
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.562
This morning, I received a call
from your mother

37:12.563 --> 37:14.397
telling me that she had lied
on the stand

37:14.398 --> 37:15.398
on your behalf.

37:15.399 --> 37:16.399
Your Honor,

37:16.400 --> 37:17.901
I wanted my daughter so badly,

37:17.902 --> 37:18.902
I would have done anything to...

37:18.903 --> 37:20.837
Forcing your own mother
to commit perjury

37:20.838 --> 37:22.806
using her own grandchild
as bait,

37:22.807 --> 37:24.741
does not lead me to agree

37:24.742 --> 37:26.710
that this person
has a clear understanding

37:26.711 --> 37:29.145
of what parenthood is all about.

37:29.146 --> 37:32.115
Mr. Dallas has
that understanding.

37:32.116 --> 37:35.051
Therefore, I have decided
to break with normal tradition

37:35.052 --> 37:37.387
and award custody
of the infant, Wendy,

37:37.388 --> 37:39.389
to her father, Jodie Dallas.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.374
I've acted irrationally
during these proceedings,

37:57.375 --> 37:58.875
and I'm sorry.

37:58.876 --> 38:01.378
I know it's hard for you
to know a person

38:01.379 --> 38:04.848
when that person's world
is caving in all around him,

38:04.849 --> 38:07.784
because all you get to see
is the fear and the craziness,

38:07.785 --> 38:10.253
so I thank you
for looking beyond that.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.256
Good luck, Mr. Dallas.

there are no hard feelings.

38:49.026 --> 38:50.994
and when it is over,

38:50.995 --> 38:52.997
you're gonna wish
you never had a daughter.

39:05.743 --> 39:07.143
[TAPPING]

39:07.144 --> 39:08.645
Jess.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.647
Hi, Mary.

39:10.648 --> 39:12.082
You're walking.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.516
Well, yes, Mary.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.953
I've known how
for quite some time now.

39:16.954 --> 39:18.321
But aren't you weak?

39:18.322 --> 39:19.289
Don't you feel weak?

39:19.290 --> 39:21.725
Well, I'm a little weak,

39:21.726 --> 39:23.226
but actually,
I felt a whole lot weaker

39:23.227 --> 39:25.228
when I was on
the Scarsdale diet.

39:25.229 --> 39:28.732
Oh, Jess, thanks.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.233
How's the baby?

39:30.234 --> 39:31.234
Fine.

39:31.235 --> 39:34.738
You must be so relieved
he isn't silver.

39:34.739 --> 39:37.474
Well, yes, I am.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.309
You know, as a matter of fact,

39:39.310 --> 39:41.811
I think a silver baby
might have been nice,

39:41.812 --> 39:43.246
especially during the holidays.

39:43.247 --> 39:46.716
He would've been
so festive looking.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.219
I'm still worried.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.187
Alien Burt wasn't silver
when I saw him,

39:51.188 --> 39:52.655
but he was still an alien,

39:52.656 --> 39:54.157
and he could
make himself disappear.

39:54.158 --> 39:56.159
So even though
the baby isn't silver,

39:56.160 --> 39:58.162
he could still be an alien.

40:06.170 --> 40:09.672
Mary... I don't know
how to break this to you,

40:09.673 --> 40:13.109
but the baby
has... disappeared.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.611
They're bathing him.

40:14.612 --> 40:16.613
Oh, thank goodness.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.115
Well, if he can disappear,

40:19.116 --> 40:20.116
let's hope he does it

40:20.117 --> 40:22.118
between the ages of 14 and 16

40:22.119 --> 40:24.621
when he's so obnoxious.

40:26.624 --> 40:27.624
Thank you.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.626
Mary, I have a message for you.

40:29.627 --> 40:30.627
From whom?

40:30.628 --> 40:31.628
From Mother.

40:31.629 --> 40:33.596
Jessie, Mother's dead.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.597
I know.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.599
Mary, I haven't discussed this
with anybody,

40:36.600 --> 40:38.101
but when I died,
I went to heaven.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.538
It is an incredible place, Mary,

40:41.539 --> 40:43.039
but now, when you go,

40:43.040 --> 40:44.541
be sure you take
electric rollers,

40:44.542 --> 40:47.545
because with that mist,
you'll have no hairdo.

40:51.048 --> 40:53.049
Anyway, Mary,
when I was in heaven,

40:53.050 --> 40:55.051
I saw Mother,
and she told me to tell you

40:55.052 --> 40:57.054
you're wearing
too much eyeliner.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.959
It's never gonna stop.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.895
She says it looks cheap.

41:05.896 --> 41:08.398
Dead, and she's still
getting to me.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.900
She told me to stay
with Chester.

41:10.901 --> 41:14.737
She said at my age,
I couldn't get anybody new.

41:14.738 --> 41:16.773
And when I die,
if I go to heaven,

41:16.774 --> 41:17.774
is that gonna be it?

41:17.775 --> 41:19.275
That's going to be
eternal paradise,

41:19.276 --> 41:21.277
listening to her?

41:21.278 --> 41:23.279
Well, Mary,
she does have a point.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.548
I mean, have you seen
the competition these days?

41:25.549 --> 41:26.549
I mean, they wear lipstick

41:26.550 --> 41:28.051
and roller skates,

41:28.052 --> 41:29.553
and nothing in between.

41:31.555 --> 41:34.057
Jessie, that's not competition.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.059
Teenyboppers on roller skates?

41:36.060 --> 41:39.063
What adult man would be
interested in one of them?

41:42.032 --> 41:43.466
You're right.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.970
Anyway, when it comes to men,

41:46.971 --> 41:49.472
I am the kiss of death.

41:49.473 --> 41:52.976
I mean, Chester gets
a brain tumor and amnesia.

41:52.977 --> 41:54.978
I get involved with Peter,
he gets killed.

41:54.979 --> 41:56.479
I get involved
with the psychiatrist,

41:56.480 --> 41:58.481
he goes nuts,
jumps out the window.

41:58.482 --> 41:59.482
[LAUGHS]

41:59.483 --> 42:01.985
I mean, I am
the kiss of death, Mary.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.486
Oh, Jessie, you are not.

42:03.487 --> 42:07.423
Even Charlie Graubart,
my fourth-grade boyfriend.

42:07.424 --> 42:09.726
Charlie Graubart.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.194
Do you know where he is?
No.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.130
On Main Street. He's a wino.

42:14.598 --> 42:18.101
He sits on Main Street
and panhandles.

42:18.102 --> 42:19.602
Of course, every time I see him,

42:19.603 --> 42:21.604
I give him $10 for coffee.

42:21.605 --> 42:25.508
By now, I could claim him
as a tax exemption.

42:25.509 --> 42:29.445
You know, when I thought
Burt was having an affair,

42:29.446 --> 42:31.414
and he thought
he was having an affair,

42:31.415 --> 42:32.849
but he really wasn't having
an affair,

42:32.850 --> 42:34.884
only I didn't know he wasn't
having an affair,

42:34.885 --> 42:37.387
and I could've gone out
and had an affair,

42:37.388 --> 42:38.389
I couldn't?

42:42.760 --> 42:45.261
I see.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.596
The thing is,

42:46.597 --> 42:48.097
I don't want to have
to tell anybody

42:48.098 --> 42:50.099
my thighs used to be better.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.568
They did?

42:51.569 --> 42:52.536
Please.

42:52.537 --> 42:55.038
Mine did too.
Much better.

42:55.039 --> 42:57.440
And then suddenly,
one morning, I woke up

42:57.441 --> 43:00.743
with somebody else's thighs.

43:00.744 --> 43:01.711
Mother's.

43:01.712 --> 43:03.680
What?
Mother's thighs.

43:03.681 --> 43:05.148
I've got Mother's thighs.

43:05.149 --> 43:08.551
Mary, if you've got
Mother's thighs,

43:08.552 --> 43:10.954
what does Mother have?

43:10.955 --> 43:13.256
Jessica.

43:13.257 --> 43:14.757
Well, I've gotta go now.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.259
Bye-bye.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.761
Now, listen, if anyone says,
"Have you seen me?"

43:18.762 --> 43:19.762
You haven't.

43:19.763 --> 43:20.763
Who would ask?

43:20.764 --> 43:23.266
Oh, you know, like,
doctors and nurses.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.268
See, they were taking me down
to x-ray

43:25.269 --> 43:26.769
to have a G.I. series,

43:26.770 --> 43:28.271
but I already had one of those,

43:28.272 --> 43:31.774
and it is such
an undignified test, Mary.

43:31.775 --> 43:33.276
So while they were
getting everything ready,

43:33.277 --> 43:34.278
I left.

43:36.246 --> 43:39.215
I'm off to pediatrics
to wave at your baby.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.152
Bye.

43:42.153 --> 43:43.653
[♪]

43:47.091 --> 43:49.859
Perkins, I can't arrest him.

43:49.860 --> 43:52.362
But he didn't rob anybody.

43:54.832 --> 43:56.332
Listen to me.

43:56.333 --> 43:57.834
A guy puts a gun
to his own throat

43:57.835 --> 43:59.836
and says to himself,
"Give me your money."

43:59.837 --> 44:01.838
That's not robbery.

44:01.839 --> 44:04.842
He's not a felon.
He's a psycho.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.345
All right, Perkins?

44:09.346 --> 44:12.348
Tell him to arrest himself.

44:12.349 --> 44:14.851
Okay, here's how I see it.

44:14.852 --> 44:16.819
We get knocked out in our house,

44:16.820 --> 44:18.721
we wake up naked
in a motel room,

44:18.722 --> 44:21.224
we go to the hospital,
and Mom has a baby.

44:21.225 --> 44:22.659
What do you think?

44:28.265 --> 44:29.265
I see no connection

44:29.266 --> 44:30.767
between being naked in a motel

44:30.768 --> 44:32.201
and having a baby.

44:32.202 --> 44:34.103
Just presenting the facts, Burt.

44:34.104 --> 44:35.104
Just the facts.

44:35.105 --> 44:38.608
The facts are
Tibbs is gonna blackmail us.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.109
I don't know how,
I don't know when,

44:40.110 --> 44:41.544
but he's gonna do it.

44:41.545 --> 44:43.913
Hmm...

44:43.914 --> 44:46.216
Do you have any idea
how or when?

44:49.053 --> 44:50.987
It just doesn't add up, Burt.

44:50.988 --> 44:52.488
Oh, it doesn't add up, huh?

44:52.489 --> 44:53.990
A guy says to us, "Stay away

44:53.991 --> 44:55.491
from my massage parlors
or else,"

44:55.492 --> 44:57.994
then he knocks us out
and takes us to a little party?

45:02.366 --> 45:03.866
This is for you.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.369
Thank you, Perkins.

45:10.808 --> 45:13.810
What are you looking at?

45:13.811 --> 45:16.312
Perkins.

45:16.313 --> 45:17.814
Get out of here.

45:22.820 --> 45:24.821
The lab reports, huh?

45:24.822 --> 45:26.322
How can they be lab reports?

45:26.323 --> 45:27.824
We didn't send anything
to the lab.

45:27.825 --> 45:29.325
I don't even know
where the lab is.

45:29.326 --> 45:30.827
There's something
you could do, Dan.

45:30.828 --> 45:31.828
Go find the lab.

45:31.829 --> 45:32.830
All right.

45:34.832 --> 45:36.833
That creep.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.334
Perkins. What is he doing?

45:38.335 --> 45:39.335
What?

45:39.336 --> 45:41.337
My own deputy,

45:41.338 --> 45:43.339
passing out this kind
of sick filth,

45:43.340 --> 45:45.842
these filthy pictures?

45:45.843 --> 45:48.344
Are those women?

45:48.345 --> 45:49.846
I ought to arrest him.

45:49.847 --> 45:51.347
Hey, Burt, look.

45:51.348 --> 45:52.348
There's a saddle,

45:52.349 --> 45:54.350
like that one in that motel room

45:54.351 --> 45:56.285
where we...

45:56.286 --> 45:59.255
We...

45:59.256 --> 46:00.190
We...

46:00.191 --> 46:03.693
You...

46:03.694 --> 46:05.194
You...

46:05.195 --> 46:06.696
Oh, my God.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.197
Oh, my God, it's us.

46:08.198 --> 46:09.699
Oh, Burt, it's us.

46:09.700 --> 46:11.200
Danny. Danny,
just calm down.

46:11.201 --> 46:13.202
Let's think.

46:13.203 --> 46:14.704
Right, right.
Thinking is good.

46:14.705 --> 46:15.705
Let's not lose control.

46:15.706 --> 46:16.706
All right, no control lost.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.207
Let's just assess
what we got here.

46:18.208 --> 46:21.210
Assessing is also nice.

46:21.211 --> 46:23.212
What we got here
are some pictures

46:23.213 --> 46:26.716
of you and me...

46:26.717 --> 46:30.720
ladies... in a motel.

46:30.721 --> 46:32.722
Nobody's wearing a whole lot,

46:32.723 --> 46:36.226
which is how you know
some of us are men.

46:39.229 --> 46:41.230
Oh, God.

46:41.231 --> 46:42.231
Oh, no.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.667
Oh, crap.

46:47.171 --> 46:48.671
Hey, Burt, look,

46:48.672 --> 46:50.673
you're wearing a garter belt.

46:50.674 --> 46:53.176
That's not me.

46:53.177 --> 46:55.178
Well, that's not
the leg of a lady.

46:55.179 --> 46:56.179
Danny, please.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.680
There are, like,
nine legs around here.

46:57.681 --> 47:00.183
Only a couple of them are mine.

47:00.184 --> 47:01.184
What are you saying, then?

47:01.185 --> 47:02.185
Are you saying it's mine?

47:02.186 --> 47:03.186
Is that it?

47:03.187 --> 47:06.189
[SNORTING]

47:06.190 --> 47:07.190
It's you.

47:07.191 --> 47:09.192
They put you in the garter belt.

47:09.193 --> 47:10.193
I'll kill him.

47:10.194 --> 47:11.194
I'll kill him.

47:11.195 --> 47:12.195
Wait, Danny.
Danny, wait, wait.

47:12.196 --> 47:13.196
There's a note.

47:13.197 --> 47:15.699
I hope it doesn't say anything.

47:23.040 --> 47:25.041
"Campbell, hit my parlors,

47:25.042 --> 47:27.044
and these pictures
hit the papers."

47:31.048 --> 47:34.050
"Have a nice day."

47:34.051 --> 47:36.018
Did he sign it?

47:36.019 --> 47:39.021
Is that really necessary?

47:39.022 --> 47:41.024
This is terrible.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.529
What are we gonna do?

47:46.530 --> 47:49.031
I don't know. I...

47:49.032 --> 47:53.002
If only we weren't smiling.

48:00.858 --> 48:02.578
