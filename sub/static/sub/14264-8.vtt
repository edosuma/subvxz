13:25.404 --> 13:27.938
Which means
he'll be madder than ever
when it wears off.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.406
Come on!

13:33.111 --> 13:36.413
Man, it's a good thing
turtles have hard shells.

13:36.481 --> 13:38.115
Oh. You're tellin' me.

13:38.183 --> 13:40.484
There must be some way
to stop Dregg.

13:40.552 --> 13:44.321
I don't know.
With that morphing jazz,
he's one tough hombre.

13:44.389 --> 13:47.358
When the hermit crab
wants to impress its enemies,

13:47.426 --> 13:49.526
it gets a bigger shell.

13:49.594 --> 13:52.196
Hey, Sensei is right.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.065
We need a bigger shell!

13:54.132 --> 13:55.899
But not a turtle shell.

14:00.872 --> 14:02.439
[ Beeps ]

14:02.507 --> 14:05.909
Of course!
It's Krang's old
android body.

14:05.977 --> 14:07.544
It's not only powerful,

14:07.612 --> 14:09.746
it's equipped with its own
molecular expander.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.081
Uh, what?

14:11.149 --> 14:14.117
A device that increases
the space between atoms,

14:14.186 --> 14:17.054
thus increasing the size
of Krang's android body.

14:17.121 --> 14:20.925
Yeah, but, dudes,
Krang's android body
was in the Technodrome.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.327
And we destroyed
the Technodrome.

14:23.395 --> 14:27.465
Yes, but Krang's android body
is practically indestructible,

14:27.532 --> 14:29.233
and chances are,
it's still intact.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.903
Oh! So, all we have to do
is go to Dimension X,

14:32.971 --> 14:35.839
find it
and bring it back.

14:35.907 --> 14:38.041
Oh, no.
Not the portal.

14:41.780 --> 14:44.448
Oh, dude, last time we used
that bogus contraption,

14:44.516 --> 14:46.216
it was a major wipeout.

14:46.284 --> 14:50.621
Will you please stop worrying?
I'm sure I can control it
this time.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.623
See? What'd I tell you?

14:52.691 --> 14:54.425
<i>[ Wind Howling ]</i>

14:56.327 --> 14:58.128
It's not what you told us
that worries me.

It's what you're not
telling us.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.113
Bait.

15:19.884 --> 15:22.419
Okay. Okay. I think
I got it stabilized.

15:22.487 --> 15:25.556

<i>I've got your friend.</i>

15:28.360 --> 15:31.161
to the labor mines
of Dimension X,

15:31.229 --> 15:34.064
I suggest
you come rescue her.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.866
Don't do it, guys!
It's a--

15:35.934 --> 15:37.801

15:37.869 --> 15:39.136
We've got to help her.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.471
Yeah, but we've gotta
get Krang's android body...

15:41.539 --> 15:43.040
if we're ever
gonna stop Dregg!

15:43.108 --> 15:45.375
Right.
You and Raphael
go to April's.

15:45.443 --> 15:47.544
Michelangelo and I will
jump through the portal.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.215
Okay.
The coordinates are set.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.983
Now let's go
before they drift.

15:53.050 --> 15:55.051
Hey, I got, like,
a better idea, dude.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.921
How 'bout if we just, um,
wait for a, uh--
[ Shouts ]

16:03.928 --> 16:05.429
...better wave.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.265
I told you
there was nothing
to worry about.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.701
Hey, look!
There's the Technodrome.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.370
I'm getting a signal.
Come on!
[ Beeping ]

16:14.338 --> 16:17.174
[ Beeping Continues ]

16:34.091 --> 16:36.493
[ Grunts ]
Get out! It's a trap!

16:40.765 --> 16:42.432
She's right.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.501
And after
I've gotten rid of you,

16:44.636 --> 16:47.838
I'll take care of
your other two reptile friends.

16:59.050 --> 17:01.452
Name your preference,
reptiles--

17:01.519 --> 17:03.654
the liquid nitrogen
spray...

17:06.090 --> 17:08.759
or the carbide
shredder.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.359
Well, if you're
giving us a choice,

17:10.428 --> 17:12.729
I'll take a two-week
paid vacation to Hawaii.

17:12.797 --> 17:16.266
In that case, allow me
to choose for you.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.935

It's the deep freeze
for you, reptiles!

You're walkin'
on thin ice, Dregg.

Oh, no. I busted the scanner
when I busted
that wacko android.

We'll never find it now.

to the portal in time.

have to. The Technodrome's

about to find out?

for such worthless beings.

21:00.591 --> 21:02.726
The gravitational stress
on the atoms...

to implode in the square root
of the half-life.
