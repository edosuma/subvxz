01:16.360 --> 01:21.195
Well, frat bros, tomorrow we leave
for spring break in Fort Lauderdale...

01:21.440 --> 01:23.954
...and we show the babes
what kind of men we really are.

01:34.640 --> 01:36.153
Hey, come on, guys.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.994
Work with me, all right?
This is our big chance to score.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.476
Now, the ratio of girls to guys
at spring break is 6-to-1 .

01:43.080 --> 01:45.674
That's the same ratio
of girls to guys at our college.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.115
We don't score there.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.080
That's because those girls
know us already.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.552
See, these girls will be total strangers,
and they'll be really drunk.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.509
You are the coolest guy we know.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.269
You have had live sex six times.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.359
You must lead us.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.676
And lead you l will, Achmed. Okay.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.471
We got plane tickets.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.790
We got hotel reservations.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.314
Have we got protection?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.913
-Hummer, what is this?
-lt's my sister's diaphragm.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.556
You said to bring protection.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.314
l wasn't talking about
that kind of protection.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.678
What do we have here?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.831
Who goes, '' Bud''?

02:52.040 --> 02:53.268
Who goes, ''Weis''?

02:53.520 --> 02:56.159
Who goes, '' Er''?

02:56.400 --> 03:00.359
You large-breasted girls
think you are so smart.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.676
Guess where we're going
for spring break.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.238
-Eunuch school?
-Gymboree?

03:07.480 --> 03:09.948
The petting zoo in your pants?

03:11.520 --> 03:12.748
Yeah, you wish.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.468
Hey, we are flying
to Fort Lauderdale.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.316
And staying in one very cool
hotel room overlooking the beach...

03:20.560 --> 03:23.279
...where large-breasted girls
will be arching their backs...

03:23.480 --> 03:26.836
...to make their breasts
seem even larger.

03:27.440 --> 03:32.673
We will be thinking of you when we're
rubbing oil on large breasts.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.593
Yeah, maybe Hummer's.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.553
At least mine are real.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.711
-Hey, ours are real!
-Hey! Hey!

03:43.240 --> 03:45.310
Come on, guys.
Let's go down to the basement...

03:45.520 --> 03:47.750
...and plan
our babe-scoring strategies.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.155
l'll bring my diaphragm.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.388
Yeah. Cool, man. Let's go.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.792
You touch--
Don't even come near me. No.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.032
This is so unfair.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.316
We should be at spring break,
not them.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.279
l mean, we're gorgeous,
and they're, like, gargoyles.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.913
How do we get to spring break...

04:11.120 --> 04:13.509
...when everything's booked,
and we don't have money?

04:13.720 --> 04:15.597
That didn't stop us
from going to Vegas.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.997
-Or Monte Carlo.
-Or the Arkansas Governor's Mansion.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.515
l guess that was just me.

04:24.680 --> 04:26.352
Well, we know what we have to do.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.751
We just gotta figure out
who we're gonna do it with.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.838
lt's your move, Griff.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.194
You know what's really gonna make
this game better...

05:09.400 --> 05:11.470
...is when we learn how to play.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.832
Maybe.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.278
Maybe not.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.792
Hit me.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.272
You didn't say, ''Simon says.''

05:34.960 --> 05:38.111
Quick. l need something
l can wear with a bikini.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.555
Well, that would be me.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.439
Something in black
that goes with a bikini.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.671
That would be me.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.955
Miss, l'm not complaining
or anything...

05:55.200 --> 05:57.634
...but isn't it a little cold
to be wearing a bikini?

05:57.840 --> 06:01.150
Oh, it's not for here. We're going
to Fort Lauderdale for spring break.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.311
Help yourselves to shoes, ladies.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.080
We've also got a lot in back.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.112
As do you girls.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.150
-Do you take checks?
-Checks, cash, kisses.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.555
Oh, spring break.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.030
lt must be a beautiful sight, huh, Al?

06:26.280 --> 06:29.670
How would l know?
My whole life's been a nuclear winter.

06:30.760 --> 06:33.115
Only way l know it's spring
is when the snow melts...

06:33.320 --> 06:35.880
...and l see my garbage
on Marcie's lawn.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.080
-Thank you. Thanks for your help.
-Thank you so much.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.548
-Thank you, girls.
-Bye.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.318
Thank you. Bye-bye.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.919
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye-bye.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.789
-Have a wonderful vacation.
-Bye-bye.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.319
Why haven't we ever been
to spring break, Al?

06:59.560 --> 07:03.189
Because we, in our infinite wisdom,
got married right after high school.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.631
Junior high.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.433
Think of all the things we missed
by getting married early.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.148
Yeah. Chasing women...

07:12.400 --> 07:15.358
...getting drunk
and vomiting every night.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.520
Eating Vienna sausages
out of the can...

07:18.760 --> 07:22.435
...over the sink, in the dark,
in your underwear.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.709
What were we thinking?

07:31.840 --> 07:33.990
Your turn to roll the dice.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.919
Gee, Hummer...

07:38.160 --> 07:44.349
...this couch is so small,
and your lap is so big.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.794
ls there anyplace on it
for little old me?

07:53.440 --> 07:58.150
lf it's all the same to you,
l'll just sit to the right of the mustard.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.398
You know, it's such a shame,
us hitting it off like this...

08:08.640 --> 08:12.633
...and you having to go away
for a whole week to Fort Lauderdale.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.474
l don't have to go.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.874
Oh, could you move
a little bit to the right?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.997
l think my Pop Rocks are going off.

08:32.480 --> 08:36.792
Well, we just have
one teensy-weensy little problem.

08:37.039 --> 08:41.078
My boyfriend just hates it
when l sleep with other guys.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.030
ls that your Pop Rocks again?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.955
No, that's me.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.432
Oh, if only l could send my boyfriend
away somewhere for a week.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.189
You know, somewhere where there's
lots of girls so he won't miss me.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.239
What? Fort Lauderdale, you say?

09:12.480 --> 09:15.597
What a wonderful idea.
And you have a ticket.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.229
Okay, meet me here tomorrow
at 4:00.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.630
-Yeah.
-And don't tell anyone.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.637
l won't.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.715
lt'll be our little secret.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.479
So, Ashley...

09:29.720 --> 09:33.349
...you really wanna spend spring break
with me, down in my basement?

09:34.160 --> 09:38.438
Nothing turns me on more than a guy
who lives in his parents' basement.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.555
l knew it would pay off.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.239
But first l have to get my insanely
jealous boyfriend out of town.

09:46.480 --> 09:50.268
-l'll kill that sucker.
-No.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.318
Because if you did, then l'd have
to take time away from us...

09:53.560 --> 09:55.437
...to wear black panties
to his funeral.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.434
And you know
how l hate to wear panties, Bud.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.633
Hey, l have an idea.

10:09.760 --> 10:14.117
Please to be sending your boyfriend
to Fort Lauderdale.

10:15.720 --> 10:19.235
He could use $500 for new clothes.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.829
Okay, guys, let's hit it.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.877
Oh, wait a second.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.348
l almost forgot.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.313
You guys go on ahead.
l have to stay back...

10:35.000 --> 10:36.228
...and feed the dog.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.431
You, sir, are a liar.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.871
And l have to go...

10:43.520 --> 10:47.195
...to the bathroom,
for a very long time.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.438
Okay, guys...

10:52.000 --> 10:53.752
...l'll level with you.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.678
l'm not going to spring break.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.512
No, l'm gonna stay here with Ashley.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.472
And l'm gonna have more sex
with her...

10:59.680 --> 11:03.195
...than anyone has ever had with
anyone since the beginning of time.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.800
That's where you're wrong.
Because me and your sister...

11:08.040 --> 11:13.478
...are gonna have more sex
and curly fries than anyone ever.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.959
No, no. Me and Mindy are gonna
run up the all-time high score.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.151
You must all leave.

11:22.400 --> 11:28.032
At any minute, Fawn is meeting me
here with her large, anxious breasts.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.319
Wait a second. Wait a second.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.074
So we're all getting some
right here in town?

11:33.280 --> 11:34.633
What are the odds?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.791
The girls should be here any minute.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.190
-Any minute now.
-Yeah.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.634
This is the life, huh, girls?

11:53.840 --> 11:55.876
How come we never went
to spring break before?

11:56.080 --> 11:58.958
-Because we never went to college.
-Oh, yeah.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.232
Gracias, Hidalgo.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.948
You know what, girls?

12:09.160 --> 12:11.754
The only thing that would
make this trip any better...

12:11.960 --> 12:14.030
...is if we could see
the looks on the faces...

12:14.240 --> 12:17.073
...of Bud and those dust-heads
when they find out where we are.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.868
Any minute now.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.398
Hi, girls.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.349
Say, we're on live TV.
Might wanna put those tops back on.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.470
You might wanna
put those bottoms on too.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.270
And you with the glasses...

13:17.480 --> 13:19.948
...you might wanna get off the beach.

13:21.480 --> 13:25.598
You probably recognize me.
l'm Dangerous Dan lnwood.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.151
Rock-TV VJ Dan lnwood.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.792
l was on General Hospital
two days last fall. Zipper mishap.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.554
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.314
You were so funny.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.988
Thanks.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.158
l'm sure you heard that Rock TV
and Phi Alpha Delta Fraternity...

13:45.360 --> 13:47.715
...are sponsoring the big
Miss Spring-Break Contest.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.832
Well, we're just here from Chicago
to have a good time...

13:51.040 --> 13:53.349
...and maybe wreck a home or two.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.831
Well, you girls are from Chicago?
We need a contestant from Chicago.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.036
-Oh, my gosh.
-Call it in the air.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.474
-lt's a coin.
-You win.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.432
Oh, my God.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.239
Kelly, you're so lucky.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.994
lt was right on the tip of my tongue.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.031
Kelly? May l call you Kelly?
Good. l will.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.032
Kelly, this is an exciting opportunity.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.117
Yeah, well, l don't know about this.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.669
See, l consider myself an actress.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.598
l don't know if l could go parading...

14:22.800 --> 14:25.872
...around a bunch of strangers
l haven't slept with yet.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.757
First prize is a hundred thou
and a car, Kel.

14:31.000 --> 14:31.989
l'm there.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.630
The snow and ice storm
that knock ed out power...

14:36.840 --> 14:39.832
... over much of Chicago yesterday
continues to paralyze the city.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.190
Luckily, schools are closed
for spring break...

14:42.400 --> 14:44.118
...and most employees
have the day off.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.998
So just about everyone is at home...

14:46.200 --> 14:49.351
... warm and toasty,
huddled around a roaring fire.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.393
Throw another clog on the fire,
will you?

15:25.760 --> 15:27.352
l thought we burned that phone.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.910
No, don't you remember?
We tried. lt wouldn't burn.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.112
Hello. Oh, hello, Peg.

15:33.360 --> 15:35.794
Al, is it cold there?

15:36.040 --> 15:39.237
lt's as cold as your feet
on my back, Peg.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.597
-Where are you?
-Oh, l'm in New Orleans at Mardi gras.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.114
lt's really warm here.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.558
-ls your dad there, Peg?
-Well, how would l know?

15:47.800 --> 15:52.396
There's 1 0,000 people here,
and they're all wearing masks.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.552
So the only one who should be isn't.
Goodbye, Peg.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.834
Why is everyone
in a warm climate but us?

16:09.080 --> 16:12.550
Oh, come on, Al. Not everybody is.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.518
Hey, guys.

16:17.880 --> 16:21.873
Well, l'm off to spring break
in Fort Lauderdale.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.395
Why do you get
to go to spring break?

16:24.640 --> 16:26.756
Yeah, you're not a college student.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.389
You're not a big-breasted blond.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.835
God knows,
you're not married to one.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.758
No, no.
But l do know one when l see one.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.039
Which is why l'm needed in Fort
Lauderdale on official frat business.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.272
l'll be judging a beauty contest.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.913
What's Marcie say about that?

16:45.160 --> 16:47.720
She said,
'' Have fun at computer camp.''

16:48.520 --> 16:52.069
l told her l'd be job training. So if you
see her, you'll cover for me, right?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.477
Not a chance.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.794
Come on, Al. This is spring break.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.759
You guys know what that's like, huh?

17:01.280 --> 17:05.478
Well, actually, Jefferson, no.
No, we don't know.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.439
Neither one of us has ever been.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.997
This is really, truly sad.

17:14.319 --> 17:17.153
Warm yourself by the fire, Jefferson.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.195
Tell us what it's like.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.078
Well...

17:23.319 --> 17:27.029
...imagine yourselves
in a tropical paradise.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.510
The palm trees swaying...

17:29.760 --> 17:33.992
...the trade winds softly caressing
the hair of the gorgeous babes...

17:34.240 --> 17:38.597
...bouncing up and down
in their micro-bikinis.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.831
An ice-cold brewski in your hand.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.719
And everywhere you look...

17:45.960 --> 17:48.918
...there are nude sunbathers.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.439
And that's before
you even leave the airport.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.273
l wish we could go.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.715
Well, what's stopping you?

18:07.240 --> 18:09.037
Nothing.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.953
Oh, well, you will need some cash.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.917
We got cash. We got cash
from that sale we made yesterday.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.276
Good thing we didn't change clothes.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.436
Hey, they're not coming.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.035
Then l guess
l should take off my condom.

18:53.120 --> 18:58.433
l believe it is the bad weather that is
preventing the girls from arriving.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.079
Hey, wake up and smell
the Slim Jims, Achmed.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.068
They're not coming.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.675
They never intended to.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.873
lt's a woman!

19:22.920 --> 19:25.753
Guys. Guys. Hey, guys.
Please, back off.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.560
lt's only Mrs. D'Arcy. Come on.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.792
Boys.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.759
Reminds me of my college days.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.879
What are you doing here?

19:41.120 --> 19:45.671
Well, your mother called from a float
somewhere on Bourbon Street...

19:45.920 --> 19:48.878
...to ask me to make sure your VCR
was set to tape Oprah...

19:49.120 --> 19:51.873
...because you were gonna be
in Fort Lauderdale.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.953
But you're not. What happened?

19:55.320 --> 19:56.958
We kind of got taken by some girls.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.553
We're not really sure how.

19:58.800 --> 20:03.157
We gave them our tickets,
and now they're not here.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.114
And now, live from Fort Lauderdale,
the Spring-Break Dance Marathon.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.558
All proceeds will be donated
to CBS to pay Bill Cosby's salary.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.352
-That's our girls!
-They're having our fun.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.830
We could be dancing
with those guys.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.398
Don't feel too badly.

20:36.640 --> 20:41.031
Girls like that are just
cheap one-night stands.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.350
You all should be developing...

20:43.600 --> 20:49.232
...full, trusting relationships,
like l have with my Jefferson.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.351
Who even now is away at
computer camp trying to better himself.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.388
Mrs. D'Arcy....

21:10.560 --> 21:12.596
Road trip!

21:15.080 --> 21:18.436
Destination: Fort Lauderdale.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.278
Goal: Swift and terrible revenge.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.479
But it is a blizzard outside,
and all the roads are closed.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.596
l drive a Benz, and l'm pissed.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.190
Come, my geeks.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.873
Revenge will be ours!

21:41.305 --> 21:47.741
