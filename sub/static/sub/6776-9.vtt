( male )
MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.219
I GOT LIKE,
NO FUCKING APPETITE LATELY.

02:10.230 --> 02:12.892
THAT'S A SIGN
OF DEPRESSION.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.322
REALLY ?

02:14.330 --> 02:16.321
OH, YEAH,
I BEEN READING UP ON IT.

02:16.330 --> 02:17.797
EVER SINCE
MY WIFE'S HYSTERECTOMY,

02:17.800 --> 02:19.427
SHE'S BEEN
REAL DOWN IN THE DUMPS.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.729
LOSS OF APPETITE,
LOSS OF SEX DRIVE,

02:22.730 --> 02:25.528
FEELINGS OF HOPELESSNESS
AND DESPAIR, NO ENERGY.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.827
ALL OF WHICH
SHE HAS.

02:26.830 --> 02:30.994
I ONLY GOT
THE LOSS OF APPETITE THING.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.854
YOU KNOW WHAT
IS DEPRESSING ?

02:39.860 --> 02:43.091
MY WIFE'S COOKING.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.118
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT ?

02:46.130 --> 02:47.722
IT LOOKS
LIKE CAT SHIT.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.527
I THINK
IT IS CAT SHIT.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.919
SHE'S JUST FUCKING
USELESS IN A KITCHEN,

02:51.930 --> 02:53.921
SHE ALWAYS
HAS BEEN.

02:53.930 --> 02:55.557
AT LEAST YOUR WIFE
STILL FUCKS YOU.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.118
THANK GOD.

02:57.130 --> 02:59.553
IF SHE DIDN'T DO THAT,
I'D HAVE TO KILL HER.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.022
OH, SHIT !

03:02.600 --> 03:04.295
( clanking sound )

03:04.300 --> 03:05.892
AW, FUCK.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.095
FUCK ME.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.852
AW, THIS IS FUCKED.

03:09.860 --> 03:12.795
FUCKING FUCK.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.656
IT'S KINDA BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT ?

03:31.660 --> 03:33.389
YEAH, IT'S
WAY BEAUTIFUL.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.756
( Brenda )
YOU ADD THE SUNSET FACTOR,
IT'LL BE PERFECT.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.694
THERE'S LIKE
HORSE SHIT EVERYWHERE.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.622
SO?

03:40.630 --> 03:43.690
SO, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'LL MESS UP YOUR WHITE DRESS ?

03:43.700 --> 03:47.056
YEAH, LIKE I'M GOING TO
WEAR A WHITE DRESS.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.195
BESIDES,

03:50.200 --> 03:52.395
IF WE EXCHANGE VOWS
SURROUNDED BY HORSE SHIT,

03:52.400 --> 03:53.697
IT'LL BE
KIND OF FITTING.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.295
MEANING YOU THINK US
GE'I'I'ING MARRIED
IS A SHI'I'I'Y IDEA ?

03:57.300 --> 04:01.191
MEANING WE'RE GOING INTO THIS
OPEN-EYED, SHIT AND ALL.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.395
AND HOPEFULLY MY MOTHER
WILL STEP IN SOME OF IT.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.823
OR EVEN BE'I'I'ER,
FALL FACE FIRST INTO IT.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.718
AND THEN IT REALLY WILL BE
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

04:07.730 --> 04:10.358
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO MARRY ME ?

04:10.360 --> 04:12.897
WE CAN STILL
CALL IT OFF.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.720
OF COURSE
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

04:14.730 --> 04:16.391
BUT I COULD
DIE, BREN.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.119
I COULD DIE AT ANY DAY,
I COULD DIE ANY MOMENT.

04:19.130 --> 04:20.791
YEAH,
AND I COULDN'T ?

04:20.800 --> 04:23.121
YEAH, WE'RE ALL
GONNA DIE, I KNOW.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.690
BUT THE CHANCES OF IT
ACTUALLY HAPPENING

04:25.700 --> 04:27.156
ARE SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER FOR ME.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.696
THAT'S JUST
A FUCKING FACT.

04:28.700 --> 04:30.793
AND THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO MARRY ME

04:30.800 --> 04:32.153
BECAUSE YOU FEEL
SORRY FOR ME.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.821
YOU REALLY THINK
I'D DO THAT ?

04:33.830 --> 04:36.253
WOW.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.853
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'VE MADE
ENOUGH SACRIFICES IN YOUR LIFE

04:39.860 --> 04:40.997
WITHOUT HAVING TO--

04:41.000 --> 04:43.127
I'M MARRYING YOU
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,

04:43.130 --> 04:45.553
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FIRST MAN
THAT I THOUGHT I COULD ACTUALLY

04:45.560 --> 04:47.528
STAND TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH,

04:47.530 --> 04:49.896
OR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE

04:49.900 --> 04:51.925
IF IT'S TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT,
OR WHATEVER.

04:51.930 --> 04:54.023
YOU'RE NOT SOME CAR
I WANT TO TRADE IN

04:54.030 --> 04:55.895
BECAUSE IT HAS
FAULTY TRANSMISSION.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.050
JESUS, DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT SHALLOW ?

04:58.060 --> 05:00.790
OF COURSE NOT.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.098
ALL WE HAVE
IS THIS MOMENT,

05:03.100 --> 05:06.126
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT NOW.

05:06.130 --> 05:08.849
THE FUTURE'S JUST
A FUCKING CONCEPT

05:08.860 --> 05:12.557
THAT WE USE TO AVOID
BEING ALIVE TODAY.

05:15.130 --> 05:16.654
SO, BE...

05:16.660 --> 05:18.651
HERE...

05:18.660 --> 05:20.651
NOW.

05:27.130 --> 05:29.655
SO, WHY DO WE NEED
TO GET MARRIED AT ALL, THEN ?

05:29.660 --> 05:32.254
SO, WE CAN RACK UP
ALL THAT FREE SHIT

05:32.260 --> 05:34.626
FROM ALL MY MOTHER'S
WEALTHY FRIENDS, THAT'S WHY.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.497
HEY, I KNOW THIS
REALLY COOL RABBI...

05:38.500 --> 05:40.559
TO POSSIBLY
DO OUR WEDDING.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.822
A RABBI ?

05:41.830 --> 05:42.751
YEAH.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.921
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN GO THERE ?

05:44.930 --> 05:46.056
WELL, YOU ARE
HALF JEWISH.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.288
YEAH, I'M ALSO
HALF CATHOLIC.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.790
SO, YOU WANT TO
INVITE THE POPE ?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.598
IT'S A MARRIAGE,
IT'S A SACRED OCCASION.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.751
YOU'D RATHER HAVE JUST SOME
FUCKING CIVIL SERVANT THERE ?

05:54.760 --> 05:56.728
WELL, PERSONALLY,
I THINK THE TWO OF US

05:56.730 --> 05:59.255
SHOULD BE ENOUGH
TO MAKE IT SACRED.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.792
HEY, DID YOU
SLEEP OKAY ?

06:11.100 --> 06:12.294
NO.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.198
I FINALLY DOZED OFF
AROUND FIVE.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.498
KEITH,
GO BACK TO BED.

06:19.500 --> 06:23.493
I'M NOT GONNA SLEEP ANYMORE,
BELIEVE ME.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.621
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK
TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT MEDICATION.

06:30.630 --> 06:32.825
YEAH, DRUGS,
THAT'S THE ANSWER.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.889
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHOOSING TO SUFFER
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO,

06:34.900 --> 06:37.323
THAT'S MUCH MORE
CONSTRUCT IVE, IDIOT.

06:37.330 --> 06:38.695
FUCK YOU.

06:38.700 --> 06:40.656
IS THERE
ANYMORE COFFEE ?

06:40.660 --> 06:43.299
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE DRINKING CAFFEINE

06:43.300 --> 06:46.121
WHEN YOUR SLEEP
IS SO ERRATIC.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.721
SUIT YOURSELF.

06:51.330 --> 06:52.649
BITCH.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.255
TAYLOR LEFI' HER
GUMMI-VITAMINS.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.727
BIG SURPRISE,
SHE HATED THOSE.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.790
YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD
RUN THESE OVER TO KARLA.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.553
OKAY, NO, KARLA CAN
GET HER MORE VITAMINS.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.699
AND THEY COULD PROBABLY USE
A LITTLE SPACE RIGHT NOW.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.351
YEAH, WELL, I NEED TO MAKE SURE
KARLA'S STAYING CLEAN.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.649
YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF RIGHT NOW, OKAY ?

07:32.400 --> 07:33.651
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE FOR.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.049
OH, I SEE.

07:36.060 --> 07:38.255
SO, BASICALLY,
I JUST EXIST TO SERVE YOU.

07:38.260 --> 07:41.149
WELL, YEAH.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.595
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
LATE FOR WORK.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.194
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

07:57.430 --> 07:59.694
THERE ARE TWO CHICKEN SALAD
SANDWICHES IN HERE,

07:59.700 --> 08:01.224
THEY'RE FOR
YOUR LUNCH.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.619
AND DON'T EAT THEM
BEFORE NOON,

08:03.630 --> 08:06.428
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL I GET HOME FROM WORK
TO EAT AGAIN.

08:06.430 --> 08:10.423
WHAT ARE THESE THINGS
SUPPOSED TO BE ?

08:12.660 --> 08:13.991
HAVE A NICE DAY.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.649
ARE WE REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
BRITNEY SPEARS IS A VIRGIN ?

08:20.660 --> 08:23.993
WHY EXACTLY
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO CARE ?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.389
I'D LIKE FOR YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR

08:26.400 --> 08:28.220
AND CHECK ON NIKOLAI
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

08:28.230 --> 08:29.993
UH, I WON'T BE HOME
UNTIL LATE.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.752
PARKER AND I
HAVE PLANS.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.557
I THOUGHT YOU AND PARKER
HAD A FALLING OUT.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.050
WE MADE UP.

08:35.060 --> 08:37.790
I FIGURED IT WAS BE'I'I'ER TO HAVE
A TOTAL LOSER FOR A FRIEND

08:37.800 --> 08:39.427
THAN TO HAVE
NO FRIENDS AT ALL.

08:39.430 --> 08:40.852
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH HER ?

08:40.860 --> 08:44.956
UM, WE'RE GOING
TO THE GE'I'I'Y.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.121
DO YOU THINK
I'M AN IDIOT ?

08:47.130 --> 08:49.325
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:49.330 --> 08:53.198
OKAY, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M LYING
TO LIKE COVER UP MY DRUG HABIT.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.920
I'M LYING TO GET OUT OF
HAVING TO EMPTY THE BEDPAN

08:56.930 --> 08:58.989
OF SOME MAN
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.490
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD HAVE TO DO THAT.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.592
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,

09:01.600 --> 09:03.056
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M ASKING YOU TO DO.

09:03.060 --> 09:04.618
GOOD.

09:04.630 --> 09:08.350
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
HOW EASY YOU HAVE IT.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.021
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE NOT GONNA START

09:10.030 --> 09:11.827
TALKING ABOUT YOUR LEGLESS
GRANDMOTHER AGAIN.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.253
I PITY YOU, CLAIRE.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.820
YOU ARE UNDER
THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION

09:16.830 --> 09:18.798
THAT LIFE
OWES YOU SOMETHING.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.655
WELL, YOU ARE IN FOR
SOME VERY HARSH SURPRISES.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.189
(sighing )

09:29.030 --> 09:32.898
SORRY I'M LATE,
TRAFFIC WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.253
ARE THEY HERE YET ?

09:34.260 --> 09:35.989
YEAH, THEY'RE WAITING
IN THE WISTERIA ROOM.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.695
DAVE, I'VE GOT SOMETHING
I NEED TO ASK YOU.

09:37.700 --> 09:38.849
WHAT ?

09:38.860 --> 09:40.327
1--

09:40.330 --> 09:41.820
WHAT'S WITH
THE RED FACE ?

09:41.830 --> 09:44.219
OH, UM,

09:44.230 --> 09:45.822
KEITH AND I
WERE FOOLING AROUND

09:45.830 --> 09:48.424
AND, WELL,
HE HADN'T SHAVED.

09:48.430 --> 09:50.250
YOU BIG WHORE.

09:50.260 --> 09:51.796
IS IT REALLY BAD ?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.724
NAH, WELL, YEAH, ACTUALLY,
IT'S BRIGHT RED.

09:54.730 --> 09:56.425
IT'S RED AS
A BABOON'S ASS.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.796
OH, MY GOD,
I LOOK LIKE A BURN VICTIM.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.791
HEY...

10:01.560 --> 10:03.653
WHAT I WANTED
TO ASK WAS

10:03.660 --> 10:06.254
IF YOU'D BE BEST MAN
AT MY WEDDING.

10:06.260 --> 10:09.127
OF COURSE I WILL.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.290
EXCELLENT.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.894
ALRIGHT,
YOU READY TO ROLL ?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.993
YEAH.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.620
GOOD LORD.

10:23.300 --> 10:27.020
SO, DAD ALREADY
TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING ?

10:27.030 --> 10:30.193
IT'S ALL SPECIFIED
IN THE PRE-NEED CONTRACT.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.998
FOR THE VIEWING,
HE'S CHOSEN A PARLIAMENT CASKET,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.026
FOLLOWED BY CREMATION
AND INTERMENT AT CEDAR GROVE,

10:36.030 --> 10:39.158
IN THE REMAINING CHAMBER OF
A PRAYER-LEVEL DOUBLE CRYPT.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.525
WITH MOM ?

10:40.530 --> 10:42.054
HARRIET MITCHELL GARRISON ?

10:42.060 --> 10:43.948
THAT'S HER.

10:45.930 --> 10:47.557
WOW.

10:47.560 --> 10:52.099
SO, UM, THERE'S
NOTHING FOR US TO DO ?

10:52.100 --> 10:55.194
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SHOW UP.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.997
OKAY.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.594
OH, MY GOD.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.422
I FEEL SO AWFUL.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.797
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME
THAT I SAW HIM.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.052
HONEY,
IT'S OKAY.

11:09.060 --> 11:12.427
HE KNEW
WE LOVED HIM.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.628
( whispering )
I can give you the number
of a great dermatologist.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.653
WHAT UP,
UNCLE KEITH ?

11:30.660 --> 11:32.423
HEY, YOU FORGOT THESE
AT MY HOUSE.

11:32.430 --> 11:35.092
I HATE THESE
NASTY OLD THINGS.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.692
HEY, THEY'RE
GOOD FOR YOU.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.258
I LIKE
THE FLINTSTONES.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.058
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE IN SCHOOL ?

11:41.060 --> 11:42.357
MAMA'S SICK.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.055
I'M STAYING HOME TODAY
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.220
HEY.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.492
DON'T COME TOO CLOSE TO ME,
I GOT THE FLU.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.728
OH, YOU GOT THE FLU.

11:47.730 --> 11:50.255
HAVE YOU BEEN
TO SEE THE DOCTOR ?

11:50.260 --> 11:51.818
I AIN'T PAYING
NOBODY'S DOCTOR $100

11:51.830 --> 11:53.422
JUST TO TELL ME
TO STAY IN BED.

11:53.430 --> 11:54.522
FUCK THAT SHIT.

11:57.730 --> 11:59.220
YOU DON'T
HAVE A TEMPERATURE.

11:59.230 --> 12:01.095
ARE YOU SURE ?

12:01.100 --> 12:04.024
MAYBE YOU SHOULD STICK
A THERMOMETER UP MY ASS.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.591
GO PLAY
IN YOUR ROOM.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.794
NO, NO,
HONEY, TAYLOR,

12:08.800 --> 12:09.926
YOU STAY HERE,
MAMA NEEDS YOU.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.591
GO!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.390
GO!

12:17.600 --> 12:19.192
OKAY, YOU GOT
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.259
YOU CAN EITHER LET ME
CHECK YOU INTO A DRUG REHAB--

12:21.260 --> 12:23.649
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I ALREADY
WENT TO REHAB IN OAKLAND !

12:23.660 --> 12:24.888
I AM CLEAN.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.151
MOTHERFUCK, KEITH !

12:26.160 --> 12:28.128
I'LL CALL DOWN TO THE STATION,
WE'LL SEARCH THIS HOUSE.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.927
AND IF WE FIND ANYTHING,
YOU FACE CHARGES.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.056
YOU GOT THAT ?

12:31.060 --> 12:32.391
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.288
YOU SOUND JUST LIKE DADDY,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

12:34.300 --> 12:35.756
YOU KNOW THAT ?

12:35.760 --> 12:37.022
YOU DONE GONE AND FUCKING
TURNED INTO DADDY.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.691
WHAT YOU GONNA
DO NEXT, KEITH,

12:38.700 --> 12:40.292
SLAP ME SO HARD
I CAN'T HEAR OUT OF ONE EAR

12:40.300 --> 12:42.052
FOR THE NEXT
DAY AND A HALF ?

12:42.060 --> 12:44.096
YOU REMEMBER THAT ?

12:45.860 --> 12:48.397
IT'S YOUR CHOICE, KARLA.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.227
GODDAMNIT. ..

12:54.230 --> 12:55.720
GODDAMNIT.

12:55.730 --> 12:57.857
YOU NEED HELP,
I CAN GET YOU HELP.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.055
I'LL FIND YOU
THE BEST HELP THERE IS,

13:00.060 --> 13:01.823
I SWEAR TO YOU,
I WILL.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.552
I SAID OKAY.

13:14.230 --> 13:17.097
OKAY, BUT IT HAS TO BE
OUTPATIENT,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.352
I'M NOT LEAVING
TAYLOR AGAIN, SO...

13:31.530 --> 13:33.794
NO MAJOR FACIAL DAMAGE,
THAT'S A PLUS.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.519
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DO
SOME MAJOR PLUGGINGS

13:36.530 --> 13:37.997
UP TOP OF THE HEAD,
THOUGH.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.423
IT'S A GOOD THING
HE'S NOT BALD.

13:40.430 --> 13:43.228
WHY IS THAT ?

13:44.660 --> 13:47.299
UH, IT'D BE A LITTLE HARD
TO WIG HIM,

13:47.300 --> 13:49.723
SINCE EVERYBODY
REMEMBERED HIM

13:49.730 --> 13:51.925
WITH HIS HEAD ALL NICE
AND SHINY, YOU KNOW ?

13:51.930 --> 13:53.249
AH.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.023
( Nikolai )
HELLO !

13:55.030 --> 13:57.897
HELLO ?

13:57.900 --> 14:00.653
OH, FOR CHRISSAKE.

14:00.660 --> 14:03.697
LOOK, I GOTI'A SWING BY APPLEBY
AND PICK UP THE PARLIAMENT.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.156
YOU PROBABLY NEED
SOME HELP WITH THAT.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.593
NOT REALLY.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.454
YES, REALLY.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.988
( laughing )

14:30.060 --> 14:31.823
( Nikolai )
HELLO !

14:32.860 --> 14:35.624
ANYONE, PLEASE,
I'M SO BORED.

14:35.630 --> 14:38.019
IT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM, PAL.

14:40.260 --> 14:41.955
HE'S GOT TO BE
DRIVING YOU CRAZY.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.518
NOT AT ALL.

14:43.530 --> 14:45.998
ACTUALLY, OUR RELATIONSHIP
HAS REACHED A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.821
OH, HOW SO ?

14:48.830 --> 14:50.855
WELL...

14:50.860 --> 14:52.691
IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT THE SEX ANYMORE.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.749
THERE'S MORE INTIMACY.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.751
HE'S LETTING
HIS GUARD DOWN,

14:57.760 --> 15:00.399
HE'S ALLOWING ME TO SEE HIM
AT HIS MOST VULNERABLE.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.757
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
CU PCAKE.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.796
CLARIFY ONE THING FOR ME:

15:06.800 --> 15:09.451
HE IS BEDRIDDEN,
RIGHT ?

15:22.400 --> 15:23.799
( Nikolai )
HELLO ?

15:23.800 --> 15:26.223
WHO IS THERE ?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.950
HELLO ?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.152
CAN YOU HELP ME ?

15:36.160 --> 15:39.721
THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU WANT.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.858
I ATE ALREADY MY LUNCH,
AND I AM STARVING.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.725
I CANNOT WALK.

15:49.230 --> 15:52.199
AH, SHE IS MY FAVORITE,
THIS ONE.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.350
SUCH A BITCH.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.820
SHE WOULD BE A WILDCAT
IN LOVE, I THINK.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.523
SHE'S THE KIND THAT
LEAVE SCRATCHING MARKS

16:01.530 --> 16:03.953
ALL OVER YOUR BODY.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.394
YEAH, BUT SHE'S LIKE...

16:07.400 --> 16:08.992
60.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.797
DOESN'T MATTER.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.995
BESIDES,
I THINK SHE'S LATIN.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.525
THEY ARE ALWAYS
HOT-BLOODED.

16:18.330 --> 16:20.491
WHAT KIND OF SANDWICH
THIS IS ?

16:20.500 --> 16:21.899
PORK.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.154
IT IS NOT TOO GOOD,
NEEDS SALT.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.492
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, I'LL EAT IT.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.559
NO, I WILL EAT.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.952
IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MINE ANYWAY.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.255
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE ?

16:37.260 --> 16:39.421
THAT'S NONE OF
YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS, PAL.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.751
OKAY...

16:42.760 --> 16:45.092
SORRY.

16:50.030 --> 16:51.054
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:51.060 --> 16:54.097
I'M HIS WIFE, HE SHOULD
BE BURIED WITH ME.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.829
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

16:55.830 --> 16:58.048
HE STIPULATED
IN HIS PRE-NEED CONTRACT

16:58.060 --> 17:00.324
THAT HE WAS TO BE BURIED
WITH HIS FORMER WIFE.

17:00.330 --> 17:01.649
THAT'S GOT
TO BE A MISTAKE.

17:01.660 --> 17:02.991
HE MUST HAVE
MADE THOSE ARRANGEMENTS

17:03.000 --> 17:04.353
BEFORE HE MARRIED ME.

17:04.360 --> 17:07.727
THIS IS DATED
OCTOBER OF '98.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.849
I NEVER EVEN KNEW
HE HAD DONE THIS.

17:17.860 --> 17:20.226
NEITHER DID
HIS DAUGHTERS.

17:20.230 --> 17:22.858
OH GOD, I'M SURE THEY
JUST LOVE IT, THOUGH.

17:22.860 --> 17:25.954
TH EY'VE ALWAYS
HATED ME.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.088
THOUGHT THEIR DADDY
WAS TOO GOOD FOR ME.

17:30.960 --> 17:33.656
AND APPARENTLY
SO DID HE.

17:33.660 --> 17:36.925
I'M SURE
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.725
SO, THIS THING'S ALL SIGNED
AND SEALED AND PAID FOR, HUH ?

17:44.730 --> 17:48.154
THERE'S NO
RECOURSE FOR ME.

17:50.660 --> 17:51.854
WELL, ACTUALLY...

17:51.860 --> 17:53.919
IT HASN'T BEEN
PAID IN FULL.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.292
REALLY ?

17:59.860 --> 18:01.157
WELL...

18:01.160 --> 18:03.526
YOU KNOW HE DID LEAVE
EVERYTHING TO ME

18:03.530 --> 18:06.624
AND I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M GOING TO BE PAYING

18:06.630 --> 18:09.292
FOR SUCH A BLATANT SLAP
IN MY FACE.

18:13.730 --> 18:16.893
WHAT THE HELL IS MOM
DOING IN BELIZE ?

18:19.260 --> 18:22.650
SHE'S ON SOME SORT OF CRUISE
FOR THE RECENTLY SEPARATED.

18:22.660 --> 18:26.289
OR MAYBE IT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO QUIT SMOKING.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.393
WHAT A FREAK.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.188
I'M FINE WITH WATER.

18:35.700 --> 18:37.395
HAVE YOU SPOKEN
TO DAD ?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.960
YEAH, RIGHT.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.091
SO, WHAT'S WITH YOU
LIVING WITH HER ?

18:45.100 --> 18:47.455
WELL, IT SURE
BES THE HOSPITAL.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.724
YOU KNOW, BREN, I STILL
GO IN THREE TIMES A WEEK

18:54.730 --> 18:56.925
TO SEE DOCTOR HANOVER.

18:56.930 --> 18:57.897
SHE'S GREAT.

18:57.900 --> 18:58.821
YEAH ?

18:58.830 --> 19:00.252
YEAH, SHE'S A TOTAL GENIUS.

19:00.260 --> 19:01.898
SHE'S...

19:01.900 --> 19:03.925
HELPED ME LOOK AT
A LOT OF MY SHIT.

19:03.930 --> 19:06.626
THAT'S GOOD.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.696
YEAH.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.891
SO, HOW'S NATE ?

19:16.900 --> 19:18.697
HE'S...

19:18.700 --> 19:21.749
NOT SO GREAT.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.855
HE WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED
WITH THIS BRAIN CONDITION,

19:25.860 --> 19:27.725
AND HE'S...

19:27.730 --> 19:31.450
HAD A COUPLE OF
SEIZURES, ACTUALLY,

19:31.460 --> 19:34.395
AND HE COULD
HAVE A STROKE.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.051
SHIT !

19:39.060 --> 19:41.153
THAT SUCKS.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.491
YEAH.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.398
WELL, NOW I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE MARRYING HIM.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.651
FUCK YOU.

19:46.660 --> 19:49.754
WOW, THAT HIT A NERVE,
MUST BE TRUE.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.523
NO, I'M JUST
SO LITTLE SURPRISED

19:51.530 --> 19:53.919
AT HOW RANDOMLY
CRUEL YOU CAN BE.

19:53.930 --> 19:56.728
I GUESS I'D FORGOTTEN WHAT
A KICK YOU GET OUT OF THAT.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.152
YEAH, SEE,
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.422
YOU INVALIDATE
ANYTHING I SAY

19:59.430 --> 20:00.920
THAT MIGHT CHALLENGE
YOUR AUTHORITY.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.057
YOU LEARNED IT
FROM MOM.

20:03.060 --> 20:05.358
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU LEARNED
HOW TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING TO ME

20:05.360 --> 20:07.294
LIKE I'M AN IDIOT
FROM DAD, I GUESS.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.097
NO, I LEARNED
THAT FROM YOU.

20:09.100 --> 20:11.728
APPARENTLY YOU'RE STILL ANGRY
AT ME FOR COMMITTING YOU.

20:11.730 --> 20:18.829
NO, THAT WAS THE BEST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ME.

20:18.830 --> 20:20.957
THEN WHY WOULDN'T
YOU SEE ME,

20:20.960 --> 20:23.997
OR TAKE MY CALLS,
OR E-MAIL ?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.389
BECAUSE DOCTOR HANOVER
SUGGESTED I MIGHT BE ABLE

20:26.400 --> 20:27.753
TO DO MORE
CONSTRUCT IVE WORK

20:27.760 --> 20:30.888
IF I CUT THINGS OFF
WITH YOU FOR A WHILE.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.629
BECAUSE YOU...

20:34.430 --> 20:38.093
YOU HAVE CONTRIBUTED A LOT
TO MY PATHOLOGY.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.489
YOU HAVE
A MEDICAL CONDITION.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.491
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
PHARMACEUTICALS.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.958
I NEVER DEVELOPED ANY FUNCTIONAL
WAY TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD,

20:45.960 --> 20:48.451
BECAUSE YOU KEPT ME
FROM IT.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.223
OH...

20:50.230 --> 20:52.323
WOW.

20:53.660 --> 20:56.197
THEY'VE DONE A REAL
NUMBER ON YOU.

20:56.200 --> 20:57.519
YOU WERE ALWAYS THERE.

20:57.530 --> 20:59.851
LOOKING OUT FOR ME,
PROTECTING ME,
BEING STRONG FOR ME.

20:59.860 --> 21:02.055
I NEVER LEARNED HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.392
I MEAN, SHIT, BRENDA, I'VE NEVER
EVEN HAD A REAL GIRLFRIEND.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.051
I NEVER LET YOU
HAVE A GIRLFRIEND ?

21:07.060 --> 21:08.789
OH, THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S REALLY--

21:08.800 --> 21:10.722
YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE !

21:10.730 --> 21:12.493
OKAY, I THOUGHT WE COULD
HAVE A RATIONAL DISCUSSION--

21:12.500 --> 21:14.752
HOW DARE YOU BLAME ME
FOR THAT, BILLY !

21:14.760 --> 21:17.228
I'M NOT SAYING THAT
YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.

21:17.230 --> 21:20.393
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED
TO DISENGAGE FROM EACH OTHER,

21:20.400 --> 21:23.551
BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS REALLY TOXIC.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.689
OKAY.

21:37.700 --> 21:41.227
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
IT NEEDS TO LAST.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.118
PROBABLY
A VERY LONG TIME.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.627
MAYBE.

21:51.430 --> 21:52.829
ANYWAY. ..

21:52.830 --> 21:56.254
I HAVE SOMEWHERE
I HAVE TO BE.

21:56.260 --> 21:58.455
BUT THANK YOU
FOR THE GRUB.

21:58.460 --> 22:00.553
OKAY.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.029
HEY.

22:20.030 --> 22:21.429
YOU LOOK NICE.

22:21.430 --> 22:23.227
THAN KS.

22:23.230 --> 22:24.197
WHERE YOU GOING ?

22:24.200 --> 22:26.896
UM, TO MEET A FRIEND.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.492
BILLY CH ENOWITH ?

22:28.500 --> 22:30.525
UM, YEAH.

22:30.530 --> 22:34.318
CLAIRE, I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD BE SEEING HIM.

22:34.330 --> 22:37.356
OKAY, I'LL JUST FILE THAT UNDER
"COULDN'T POSSIBLY MATTER LESS".

22:37.360 --> 22:38.759
HE CAN BE DANGEROUS.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.399
I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF, NATE.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.220
OH, OKAY.

22:43.230 --> 22:44.959
WELL, YOU ARMED ?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.848
YOU KNOW, IN CASE
HE PULLS A KNIFE ON YOU ?

22:46.860 --> 22:48.418
HOW MUCH TIME
HAVE YOU SPENT WITH HIM ?

22:48.430 --> 22:49.988
HOW MUCH TIME
HAVE YOU SPENT WITH HIM ?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.127
ENOUGH TO KNOW HE ISN'T
A DROOLING PSYCHOPATH.

22:52.130 --> 22:54.018
HE'S GOT A DISEASE.

22:54.030 --> 22:56.498
HE WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE
HE WENT OFF HIS MEDICATION

22:56.500 --> 22:59.219
BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE FUCKED UP
AND IN DENIAL ABOUT IT.

22:59.230 --> 23:01.118
IT'S UNDER CONTROL NOW.

23:01.130 --> 23:03.690
SOUND FAMILIAR ?

23:08.830 --> 23:12.129
IT WAS VERY SLOW
AT WORK TODAY.

23:12.130 --> 23:14.951
IT IS BECAUSE
I WASN'T THERE.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.952
YOU AND ROBBIE
ARE LAZY.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.825
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.628
WHY, JUST TODAY
I RE-ORGANIZED THE RIBBONS,

23:22.630 --> 23:24.894
I CLEANED THE INSIDE
OF THE CASH REGISTER,

23:24.900 --> 23:27.118
AND I SPENT A COUPLE OF HOURS
LOOKING AT THE BOOKS.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.099
THAT IS NOT YOUR JOB.

23:30.100 --> 23:32.398
NO, AND IT'S APPARENTLY
NOT YOURS, EITHER.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.051
I'VE NEVER SEEN A MESSIER, MORE
INCOHERENT BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM.

23:35.060 --> 23:36.948
I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND
WAS BAD.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.928
I DON'T WANT YOU
MESSING WITH MY BOOKS.

23:38.930 --> 23:42.149
THIS IS MY PERSONAL FINANCES,
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.889
MAY I REMIND YOU THAT
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE

23:43.900 --> 23:45.322
OF ALL YOUR MEDICAL BILLS ?

23:45.330 --> 23:46.592
I WILL PAY BACK.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.420
YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN
BIG TROUBLE IF YOU GET AUDITED.

23:48.430 --> 23:49.852
BULLSHIT.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.088
LANGUAGE.

23:53.630 --> 23:55.894
( dog barking )

23:59.100 --> 24:02.524
SO, LISTEN, I REALLY
WANTED TO THANK YOU.

24:02.530 --> 24:04.498
FOR WHAT ?

24:04.500 --> 24:08.391
FOR BEING THE ONLY PERSON
WHO KEPT IN TOUCH WITH ME

24:08.400 --> 24:11.096
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOME FOR
THE TRAGICALLY INAPPROPRIATE.

24:11.100 --> 24:12.499
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

24:12.500 --> 24:15.492
YOUR E-MAILS WERE LIKE,
TOTALLY BRILLIANT.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.649
I SAVED THEM ALL.

24:16.660 --> 24:20.152
IT WAS LIKE THE ONLY THING
THAT KEPT ME GOING.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.525
WELL...

24:21.530 --> 24:23.919
I KNOW I WOULD NEVER
HAVE GIVEN ME A SECOND CHANCE,

24:23.930 --> 24:26.319
AFTER THE WAY I TREATED YOU
THE FIRST TIME WE MET.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.948
SO, NO WORD
FROM GABE AT ALL ?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.097
NADA.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.749
WHICH IS FINE.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.228
LIKE, SERIOUSLY,
GOOD RIDDANCE.

24:36.230 --> 24:39.154
I MEAN,
IT WAS SO OBVIOUS

24:39.160 --> 24:41.390
HE WAS NEVER GONNA TAKE CHARGE
OF HIS LIFE, YOU KNOW ?

24:41.400 --> 24:44.119
WELL, IT'S HARD,
FEW PEOPLE EVER DO.

24:44.130 --> 24:46.451
YEAH, BUT MOST PEOPLE
ARE ABLE TO AVOID

24:46.460 --> 24:48.257
BECOMING DRUG-ADDICT
CRIMINALS.

24:48.260 --> 24:51.627
MOST PEOPLE.

24:54.860 --> 24:55.895
HEY...

24:55.900 --> 24:57.219
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TOMORROW ?

24:57.230 --> 25:00.119
I'M NOT SURE,
WHY ?

25:00.130 --> 25:04.419
WELL, I NEED SOME HELP
WITH THIS PROJECT AND, UH...

25:04.430 --> 25:08.127
THERE'S NOT REALLY
ANYBODY ELSE I CAN ASK.

25:08.130 --> 25:10.348
OKAY.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.828
YEAH ?

25:12.830 --> 25:14.889
COOL.

25:38.760 --> 25:40.591
And we're back
with our exclusive visit

25:40.600 --> 25:43.319
with one of the year's happiest
and sexiest couples.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.457
David and Keith
Fisher Charles.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.189
50 guys, tell me,
how do you do it ?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.657
Well, Leeza,
it takes a lot of work.

25:49.660 --> 25:50.922
( David )
It's not that much work.

25:50.930 --> 25:52.693
He's right,
we've done all the work.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.622
I think people don't appreciate
how important that really is.

25:54.630 --> 25:55.995
No, they really don't.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.524
Now, you've kids,
how many ?

25:57.530 --> 25:58.451
Two.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.394
And we're talking
about a third.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.358
Yeah, we're talking
about a third.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.920
I think the key is to do
everything together.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.750
From PTA meetings

26:07.760 --> 26:09.751
to the White Party
in Palm Springs,

26:09.760 --> 26:11.227
togetherness is the key.

26:11.230 --> 26:13.755
We're a partnership,
we're a team.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.791
HOW LONG HAVE
I BEEN ASLEEP ?

26:18.800 --> 26:20.927
ABOUT AN HOUR,
I THINK.

26:20.930 --> 26:23.490
SHIT.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.229
I'M NEVER GONNA
GET BACK TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

26:25.230 --> 26:27.221
WHY DIDN'T
YOU WAKE ME UP ?

26:27.230 --> 26:29.289
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOTALLY
SLEEP DEPRIVED,

26:29.300 --> 26:31.552
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT
WHERE YOU CAN GET IT.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.348
ARE YOU STAYING
HERE TONIGHT ?

26:36.360 --> 26:38.123
I WAS PLANNING ON IT.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.850
WOULD YOU RATHER
I DIDN'T ?

26:41.860 --> 26:42.997
MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.321
MAYBE WE'RE MOVING
A LITTLE TOO FAST.

26:45.330 --> 26:48.652
OKAY, I CAN GO HOME.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.799
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT,
YOU KNOW,

26:50.800 --> 26:52.597
WE'VE SPENT THE LAST
SIX NIGHTS TOGETHER.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.024
YEAH, SURE,
NO PROBLEM.

26:56.530 --> 26:58.395
CALL ME TOMORROW.

27:06.430 --> 27:07.988
WHAT ?

27:19.200 --> 27:20.952
IT'S WHAT
OUR FATHER WANTED !

27:20.960 --> 27:22.496
NO, IT'S WHAT YOU WANT !

27:22.500 --> 27:24.058
BECAUSE YOU'VE
NEVER LIKED ME.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.527
WELL, YOU GOT
THAT RIGHT.

27:25.530 --> 27:27.054
YOU HATED THAT YOU COULDN'T
CONTROL YOUR FATHER

27:27.060 --> 27:28.459
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE,
AND NOW,

27:28.460 --> 27:29.757
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT
WHEN HE'S DEAD.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.591
IT WAS HIS DECISION !

27:31.600 --> 27:34.728
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNPAID
BALANCE ON THE ACCOUNT--

27:34.730 --> 27:36.152
WE'LL PAY FOR IT !

27:36.160 --> 27:37.320
IF YOU TAKE ONE CENT
FROM THEM,

27:37.330 --> 27:38.729
YOU'LL BE HEARING
FROM MY ATTORNEY.

27:38.730 --> 27:40.129
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S NECESSARY.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.552
OH, NO ?

27:41.560 --> 27:42.925
I GAVE THE LAST SIX YEARS
OF MY LIFE TO THAT MAN.

27:42.930 --> 27:44.955
AND CONTRARY TO WHAT
THESE STUPID BITCHES THINK,

27:44.960 --> 27:46.552
I REALLY DID LOVE HIM,

27:46.560 --> 27:48.050
AND I WILL NOT
BE HUMILIATED LIKE THIS.

27:48.060 --> 27:49.994
YEAH, WELL,
IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW

27:50.000 --> 27:51.888
OUR FATHER'S
INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY,

27:51.900 --> 27:53.788
YOU WILL BE HEARING
FROM OUR ATTORNEY.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.051
WHO USED
TO WORK FOR DISNEY.

27:55.060 --> 27:56.459
BRING IT ON,
FERRET FACE.

27:56.460 --> 27:58.223
OH, FUCK YOU,
YOU GOLD-DIGGING SLUT !

27:58.230 --> 27:59.822
HOW DARE YOU--

27:59.830 --> 28:00.990
THERE ARE NAKED PICTURES
OF YOU ON THE INTERNET !

28:01.000 --> 28:02.456
MY SON SHOWED
THEM TO ME !

28:02.460 --> 28:05.952
SHUT UP, ALL OF YOU,
SHUT THE FUCK UP !

28:07.260 --> 28:11.094
JESUS CHRIST,
A MAN DIED.

28:11.100 --> 28:13.193
YOUR HUSBAND,

28:13.200 --> 28:14.724
YOUR FATHER.

28:14.730 --> 28:16.357
HE LIVED A LIFE,

28:16.360 --> 28:17.998
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.491
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.355
AND IF YOU
REALLY LOVED HIM,

28:24.360 --> 28:25.622
AND I BELIEVE YOU DID,

28:25.630 --> 28:27.757
YOU'LL GIVE HIM
WHAT HE WANTED.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.728
IF YOU DON'T, THEN YOU
NEVER REALLY LOVED HIM.

28:29.730 --> 28:31.425
IT'S AS SIMPLE
AS THAT.

28:35.030 --> 28:36.657
THANK YOU.

28:36.660 --> 28:40.050
AND IF I SO MUCH
AS GET A PHONE CALL
FROM ANYBODY'S LAWYER,

28:40.060 --> 28:41.618
WE'LL GIVE
THE BODY BACK

28:41.630 --> 28:43.427
AND THE THREE OF YOU
CAN TEAR HIM TO PIECES

28:43.430 --> 28:45.990
LIKE FUCKING JACKALS
IF YOU WANT TO.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.925
IT'S NOT
YOUR DECISION !

29:04.360 --> 29:05.725
OH, GOD.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.522
OH, MY GOD.

29:10.530 --> 29:12.589
HEY, I'M RIGHT HERE, OKAY ?

29:13.930 --> 29:15.124
IT'S OKAY.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.358
WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME, KEITH ?

29:27.260 --> 29:29.558
I USED TO BE OKAY.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.298
I USED TO ABLE TO LIVE
WITHOUT ALL THIS SADNESS,

29:39.300 --> 29:42.599
WITHOUT ALL THIS,

29:42.600 --> 29:46.024
NEVER HAVING ANY HOPE--

29:46.030 --> 29:47.657
YOU'RE HERE,
AREN'T YOU ?

29:50.000 --> 29:54.118
AND MY BABY,
SHE'S SO PRECIOUS.

29:54.130 --> 29:57.691
I AM SUCH A BAD MOTHER.

29:57.700 --> 30:00.225
HEY, LOOK AT ME,
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.926
I'VE SEEN WORSE,
BELIEVE ME, I HAVE.

30:02.930 --> 30:06.855
NONE OF IT'S HER FAULT,
NONE OF IT HER FAULT.

30:06.860 --> 30:09.795
SHE DOESN'T
DESERVE THIS.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.621
LOOK, JUST PUT IT
ALL BEHIND YOU, OKAY ?

30:12.630 --> 30:16.293
JUST PUT IT
ALL BEHIND YOU.

31:25.860 --> 31:27.919
LISA.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.327
NATE, HI.

31:31.330 --> 31:33.093
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

31:33.100 --> 31:35.022
OH, I'M JUST...

31:37.060 --> 31:38.857
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT MOVIE PRODUCER

31:38.860 --> 31:40.691
WHO WAS LOOKING
FOR A VEGAN CHEF ?

31:40.700 --> 31:42.850
WELL, I FINALLY CAVED IN
AND TOOK THE JOB.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.225
COOL.

31:44.230 --> 31:45.720
YEP, FINALLY SOLD OUT.

31:45.730 --> 31:48.051
SO, YOU LIVE HERE NOW.

31:48.060 --> 31:50.096
WELL, THE PALISADES.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.159
WELL, SINCE WHEN ?

31:52.160 --> 31:55.027
SINCE, UM,
RIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS.

31:55.030 --> 31:59.490
I DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER YOU.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.695
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
A WHOLE NEW LIFE AND ALL.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.122
LISA, COME ON,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.155
ALRIGHT ?

32:05.160 --> 32:07.799
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

32:07.800 --> 32:09.927
THERE'S A GREAT JUICE BAR HERE,
LET'S GET CAUGHT UP, OKAY ?

32:09.930 --> 32:10.851
OKAY.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.022
"OF ALL THE LIES
WE'RE FED,

32:16.030 --> 32:19.522
"ON WHICH WE GORGE IN OUR
COMFORT-ADDICT ED WORLD,

32:19.530 --> 32:24.320
"NONE IS MORE INSIDIOUS
THAN THE LIE OF ROMANCE.

32:24.330 --> 32:27.356
"THE SEDUCTIVE
BUT INFANTILE NOTION

32:27.360 --> 32:31.194
"THAT SOMEWHERE THERE EXISTS
SOMEONE TO COMPLIMENT US

32:31.200 --> 32:32.519
"IN EVERY WAY,

32:32.530 --> 32:36.193
"SOMEONE WHO WILL
MAKE US COMPLETE.

32:36.200 --> 32:40.159
"OF COURSE,
THIS ILLUSION KEEPS US

OF COURSE,
WE ARE NOTHING."

33:07.130 --> 33:09.690
IT'S STRANGE, I MEAN,
SHE'S A STRICT VEGAN,

33:09.700 --> 33:12.555
BUT SHE DRINKS LIKE A FISH
AND SHE DOES A LOT OF BLOW.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.357
BUT SHE'S NICE TO ME.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.726
AND I NEEDED TO MAKE SOME
REAL MONEY FOR A CHANGE.

33:16.730 --> 33:17.924
YEAH.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.625
SO, WHAT'S NEW
WITH YOU ?

33:19.630 --> 33:21.495
NOT MUCH.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.252
SAME OLD, SAME OLD,
YOU KNOW ?

33:23.260 --> 33:24.955
HOW'S BRENDA ?

33:24.960 --> 33:26.621
UH, SHE'S GREAT.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.291
WE'RE, UH...

33:28.300 --> 33:31.121
WE'RE, UH...

33:31.130 --> 33:32.688
WE'RE ENGAGED.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.554
YOU'RE KIDDING ?

33:34.560 --> 33:37.199
YEAH, I KNOW.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.221
WHAT ABOUT YOU,
ARE YOU SEEING ANYBODY ?

33:40.230 --> 33:41.754
NO, NOT REALLY.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.320
OH, BY THE WAY,
I'M PREGNANT.

33:44.330 --> 33:47.527
UH, WOW,
THAT'S GREAT.

33:47.530 --> 33:49.054
YEP, FIVE MONTHS.

33:49.060 --> 33:52.757
SHE'S A KICKER.

33:54.700 --> 33:55.792
DON'T WORRY.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.119
I DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING FROM YOU.

33:57.130 --> 33:58.529
I DON'T EXPECT
ANYTHING AT ALL.

33:58.530 --> 33:59.849
LISA, I DON'T KNOW, HOW--

33:59.860 --> 34:02.249
DON'T YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
CAME TO SEATTLE LAST AUGUST ?

34:02.260 --> 34:03.796
AND YOU FUCKED ME ?

34:03.800 --> 34:05.153
AND THEN YOU LEFT
THE NEXT DAY,

34:05.160 --> 34:06.798
LIKE IT DIDN'T MEAN
A GODDAMN THING ?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.392
WELL, IT OBVIOUSLY
MEANT SOMETHING TO YOU,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.197
BECAUSE YOU WERE CRYING
LIKE A FUCKING BABY THAT NIGHT.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.428
THAT'S NOT THE REASON
I WAS CRYING--

34:11.430 --> 34:13.557
YOU WERE CRYING BECAUSE
YOU KNEW YOU WERE HOME,

34:13.560 --> 34:14.891
BECAUSE YOU MISSED ME,

34:14.900 --> 34:17.027
BECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT
YOU AND I SHOULD BE TOGETHER,

34:17.030 --> 34:18.497
AND THEN YOU FUCKED ME.

34:18.500 --> 34:20.195
LISA, THAT IS
NOT THE REASON--

34:20.200 --> 34:21.292
AND THEN YOU CHICKENED OUT
THE NEXT DAY

34:21.300 --> 34:22.858
AND I SAW YOU FOR
EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.623
A FUCKING COWARD WHO WAS NEVER
GOING TO OWN UP TO THE WAY

34:24.630 --> 34:25.927
HE REALLY
FELT ABOUT ME.

34:25.930 --> 34:28.148
LISA, LISA, HOW COULD
YOU NOT TELL ME ABOUT THIS ?

34:28.160 --> 34:30.025
BECAUSE WE ALREADY WENT
THROUGH THIS ONCE BEFORE.

34:30.030 --> 34:33.056
BUT THIS TIME
I'M GONNA DO IT.

34:33.060 --> 34:34.357
I'M GONNA HAVE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.850
LISA--

34:35.860 --> 34:37.418
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU KNOW, ON
THE WHOLE GETTING MARRIED THING.

34:37.430 --> 34:40.524
SHE MUST BE
OUT OF HER FUCKING MIND.

34:40.530 --> 34:41.656
LISA, JUST GIVE ME--

34:41.660 --> 34:42.854
DON'T !

34:55.900 --> 34:59.449
( moaning )

35:14.030 --> 35:15.895
( knocking )

35:15.900 --> 35:19.324
HEY, COME ON IN.

35:34.100 --> 35:36.660
ALRIGHT,
LET ME SHOW YOU.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.728
YOU CAN PUT YOUR PURSE DOWN
IF YOU LIKE.

35:42.430 --> 35:43.590
HERE IT IS.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.522
THIS IS YOUR FOCUS...

35:45.530 --> 35:48.055
AND THIS IS
YOUR ZOOM.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.394
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.857
SO, HERE YOU GO.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.328
YOU'LL GET A FEEL
FOR IT.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.396
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ?

35:58.400 --> 36:01.551
JUST, YOU KNOW,
FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.494
RELAX, DON'T THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF AT ALL.

36:03.500 --> 36:06.628
I KNOW THAT'S LIKE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR A 17-YEAR-OLD.

36:06.630 --> 36:08.029
18.

36:08.030 --> 36:11.295
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS,
YOU'RE GOING TO BE 18

36:11.300 --> 36:13.791
FOR THE REST OF
YOUR LIFE.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.056
I'VE TRIED
TO DO SELF-PORTRAITS BEFORE,

36:28.060 --> 36:30.028
BUT THEY ALWAYS TURN OUT
SO CONTRIVED,

36:30.030 --> 36:32.498
LIKE I'M TRYING TO BE
SOME VERSION OF MYSELF.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.754
SO FUCKING JUVENILE.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.398
AND I REALLY WANT
TO SEE IT, YOU KNOW ?

36:39.400 --> 36:44.099
I WANT TO, I NEED
TO SEE WHAT I'VE DONE.

36:45.700 --> 36:47.554
AND I THINK
IT REALLY IS IMPOSSIBLE

36:47.560 --> 36:49.323
FOR SOMEBODY
TO SEE THEMSELVES.

36:49.330 --> 36:52.697
YOU NEED
SOMEONE ELSE'S EYES.

36:54.860 --> 36:57.294
I NEED SOMEBODY ELSE
TO SEE ME.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.928
SOMEBODY
WHO ISN'T BRENDA.

36:59.930 --> 37:03.627
SHE SEES THINGS
A LITTLE TOO DARKLY.

37:03.630 --> 37:06.451
I MEAN, I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP GOING THERE.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.792
BESIDES, I'VE LOOKED
THROUGH HER EYES

37:08.800 --> 37:10.688
ENOUGH FOR ONE LIFETIME,
YOU KNOW ?

37:15.430 --> 37:17.557
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ?

37:17.560 --> 37:20.324
I'M ON YOUR SCAR,
REALLY CLOSE UP.

37:20.330 --> 37:23.595
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE ?

37:23.600 --> 37:26.023
THE SURFACE
OF THE MOON.

37:28.930 --> 37:30.750
GOOD.

37:35.460 --> 37:37.291
THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT NARCISSUS.

37:37.300 --> 37:41.725
IT'S NOT THAT HE'S SO FUCKING
IN LOVE WITH HIMSELF,

37:41.730 --> 37:45.848
BECAUSE HE ISN'T AT ALL,
HE FUCKING HATES HIMSELF.

37:48.200 --> 37:51.454
IT'S THAT WITHOUT
THAT REFLECTION

37:51.460 --> 37:53.189
LOOKING BACK AT HIM...

37:53.200 --> 37:56.226
HE DOESN'T EXIST.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.099
(crying )

38:05.900 --> 38:08.027
BILLY, ARE YOU OKAY ?

38:11.400 --> 38:12.753
YEAH.

38:15.130 --> 38:17.223
YEAH, DON'T BE FREAKED OUT,
THIS IS GOOD.

38:17.230 --> 38:19.095
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I NEEDED TO HAPPEN.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.728
I'M FUCKING CRYING.

38:22.330 --> 38:24.025
OH, GOD, I'M SORRY,
THIS IS INTENSE.

38:24.030 --> 38:26.851
I'M SORRY, YOU CAN GO,
IT'S OKAY,

38:26.860 --> 38:28.122
I'LL BE ALRIGHT,
I SWEAR.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.095
NIKOLAI ?

39:22.100 --> 39:23.749
I TOLD YOU
HE'S NOT HERE.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.091
WHERE IS NIKOLAI ?

39:25.100 --> 39:26.226
HE'S NOT IN TODAY.

39:26.230 --> 39:27.595
CAN I HELP YOU ?

39:27.600 --> 39:28.624
WHERE IS HE ?

39:28.630 --> 39:29.892
HE'S AT HOME.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.892
NO, THERE IS NO ONE
AT HIS HOUSE.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.596
WHO ARE YOU ?

39:35.600 --> 39:38.057
I AM A FRIEND OF HIS.

39:38.060 --> 39:40.722
I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR HIM.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.959
I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.450
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

39:46.460 --> 39:49.657
HE WAS ROBBED AND BEATEN UP AND
THE POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING.

39:49.660 --> 39:53.357
( speaking Russian )

39:53.360 --> 39:56.454
YOU TELL...

40:01.030 --> 40:04.659
YOU TELL NIKOLAI

40:04.660 --> 40:07.595
THAT YURI SAYS
HE IS SORRY

40:07.600 --> 40:10.524
AND HOPES HE WILL
BE BETTER VERY SOON.

40:17.330 --> 40:19.457
I TAKE THESE
FOR MY MOTHER.

40:31.230 --> 40:33.289
WAY TO GO,
BUDDY BOY.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.224
NICE TO KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SHOOTING BLANKS, RIGHT ?

40:36.230 --> 40:39.552
WHAT THE FUCK
AM I GOING TO DO ?

40:39.560 --> 40:41.755
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING,
THAT'S THE BEAUTY PART.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.990
I HAVE TO TELL BRENDA.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.627
NO, YOU DON'T.

40:45.630 --> 40:49.555
I CAN'T KEEP SOMETHING
LIKE THIS FROM HER.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.891
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.822
NOT IF YOU TELL HER,
YOU'RE NOT.

40:52.830 --> 40:55.219
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'D STAY WITH YOU, HMM ?

40:55.230 --> 40:57.619
MY GUESS IS SHE'S JUST LOOKING
FOR A WAY OUT, ANYWAY.

40:57.630 --> 41:00.349
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE
SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT THE...

41:02.030 --> 41:03.190
WHAT ?

41:03.200 --> 41:05.293
YOU THINK SHE MEANT
EVERYTHING SHE SAID

41:05.300 --> 41:06.858
ABOUT STICKING
WITH YOU ?

41:06.860 --> 41:08.589
YEAH, OH, YEAH.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.454
NOTHING TURNS
THE WOMEN ON MORE

41:10.460 --> 41:12.496
THAN A POTENTIALLY
FATAL BRAIN CONDITION.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.297
TRY COUGHING UP BLOOD,

41:14.300 --> 41:16.495
I BET YOU'LL BE GETTING LAID
LEFT AND RIGHT.

41:18.330 --> 41:19.649
YOU KNOW,
BUDDY-BOY ?

41:19.660 --> 41:21.958
SOMETIMES YOU CAN
BE A FUCKING MORON.

41:24.630 --> 41:25.858
I CAN'T.

41:25.860 --> 41:28.090
SURE YOU CAN, YOU CAN
GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING.

41:28.100 --> 41:29.829
THERE'S SHIT ABOUT ME
YOU STILL DON'T KNOW,

41:29.830 --> 41:30.990
THINGS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.888
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE BETTER OFF FOR IT.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.822
NO, I SHOULD TELL HER,
SHE DESERVES THAT.

41:34.830 --> 41:36.798
YOU WANT
TO DIE ALONE ?

41:36.800 --> 41:38.449
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

41:44.630 --> 41:47.599
OH, MY GOD, IT WAS LIKE,
HALLUCINATORY,

41:47.600 --> 41:49.955
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT IT WAS SO,
YOU KNOW...

41:49.960 --> 41:52.724
LIKE I COULD JUST, I COULD
FEEL EVERY INCH OF MY SKIN,

41:52.730 --> 41:57.019
LIKE I COULD JUST FEEL
THAT I WAS SO GODDAMN ALIVE.

41:57.030 --> 42:00.397
YOU KNOW HOW GUYS WHO'VE
BEEN TO WAR TALK ABOUT IT ?

42:00.400 --> 42:01.549
LIKE THAT.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.858
LIKE I WAS RIGHT IN
THE FUCKING CENTER OF LIFE !

42:03.860 --> 42:07.352
WOW, FOR A RANDOM FUCK,
HE SOUNDS PRETTY GREAT.

42:07.360 --> 42:10.158
BUT IT WASN'T HIM,
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER HIM.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.627
GOD, WHAT WAS IT ?

42:11.630 --> 42:14.793
I'VE HAD SPONTANEOUS,
ANONYMOUS SEX BEFORE.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.927
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE THRILL
OF BREAKING THE RULES.

42:16.930 --> 42:19.819
YOU ARE ENGAGED.

42:19.830 --> 42:22.549
YOU KEEP HARPING ON
ABOUT THAT, IT'S NOT IT.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.428
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME AND NATE,
IT'S NOT IT AT ALL.

42:26.430 --> 42:27.658
IT'S ABOUT...

42:27.660 --> 42:32.097
IT'S ABOUT ME NOT BEING
OUTSIDE MYSELF, FOR ONCE.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.419
NOT WATCHING,

42:33.430 --> 42:35.819
NOT ANALYZING EVERY
GODDAMN MOMENT AS IT HAPPENS.

42:35.830 --> 42:37.457
NOT HOLDING BACK.

42:37.460 --> 42:38.654
JUST BECOMING,

42:38.660 --> 42:41.595
BECOMING PURE SENSATION,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.398
BECOMING ENERGY,

42:44.400 --> 42:46.129
JUST BECOMING NATURE.

42:46.130 --> 42:48.098
SOUNDS PRETTY GREAT.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.692
YEAH,
OH, MY GOD.

42:49.700 --> 42:52.624
IT WAS SUCH
A FUCKING RUSH.

42:52.630 --> 42:55.292
AND THEN I CAME HOME

42:55.300 --> 42:58.451
AND I WROTE LIKE 12 PAGES
WITHOUT STOPPING.

42:58.460 --> 43:00.655
WOW.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.623
WHAT IF
I'M LOSING MY SHIT ?

43:06.630 --> 43:10.418
WHAT IF THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF
SOME SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS ?

43:10.430 --> 43:14.799
YOU KNOW, CHANCES ARE,
I AM GENETICALLY PREDISPOSED.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.618
FUCK IT, THAT'S JUST ME
BEING PARANOID.

43:18.630 --> 43:22.259
THAT'S JUST ME BEING AFRAID
TO BE OUT OF CONTROL.

43:22.260 --> 43:24.490
AS IF ANYBODY'S
EVER IN CONTROL.

43:24.500 --> 43:26.388
I CAN GIVE YOU
THE NAME OF MY THERAPIST

43:26.400 --> 43:28.129
IF YOU WANT
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

43:28.130 --> 43:30.018
UH, NO THANKS.

43:30.030 --> 43:33.898
I WILL NEVER TALK
TO A THERAPIST.

43:33.900 --> 43:36.824
THERAPISTS FUCKED UP
MY LIFE.

43:36.830 --> 43:39.424
I DON'T NEED
A FUCKING THERAPIST.

43:41.500 --> 43:42.694
WANT ANOTHER BEER ?

43:42.700 --> 43:44.122
SURE.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.828
I COME TO THIS COUNTRY
WITH NOTHING.

43:49.830 --> 43:53.994
MY WIFE WAS ALREADY DEAD
FOR MANY YEARS,

43:54.000 --> 43:57.197
AND MY SON...

43:57.200 --> 44:00.522
MY SON IS DEAD TOO,

44:00.530 --> 44:03.226
AND, SO...

44:03.230 --> 44:05.994
I COME TO AMERICA,
WHY NOT ?

44:14.730 --> 44:16.322
RIDING BUS.

44:20.430 --> 44:23.649
GROWING POTATO
IN THE BOX IN...

44:23.660 --> 44:25.753
THE ROOF.

44:30.830 --> 44:33.458
BANK, THEY DON'T WANT
TO GIVE ME MONEY
TO START MY BUSINESS,

44:33.460 --> 44:37.396
SO, I HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE ?

44:37.400 --> 44:40.494
HOW MUCH MONEY
DO YOU OWE THEM ?

44:43.360 --> 44:44.497
I...

44:44.500 --> 44:48.891
I DON'T KNOW,
IT KEEPS CHANGING.

44:48.900 --> 44:51.198
"INTEREST."

44:51.200 --> 44:53.760
NIKOLAI, YOU SHOULD
CALL THE POLICE.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.990
YEAH, POLICE.

44:57.560 --> 45:01.098
THIS IS NO DIFFERENT
THAN MOSCOW.

45:05.330 --> 45:06.888
NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.526
KEITH,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

45:26.060 --> 45:27.857
NO.

45:29.230 --> 45:30.822
WHAT'S WRONG ?

45:35.260 --> 45:36.818
IS IT BECAUSE
OF THE SHOOTING--

45:36.830 --> 45:38.957
NO, IT IS NOT BECAUSE
OF THE SHOOTING !

45:38.960 --> 45:40.598
DAMN, DAVID,

45:40.600 --> 45:42.556
YOU'RE LIKE A FUCKIN'
BROKEN RECORD ABOUT THAT.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.754
WHAT IS IT THEN ?

45:43.760 --> 45:45.057
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE ?

45:45.060 --> 45:48.029
AM I NOT ALLOWED TO FEEL
SHITTY EVERY NOW AND THEN ?

45:48.030 --> 45:50.294
I JUST WANT TO HELP.

45:57.600 --> 46:01.195
IS IT BECAUSE TAYLOR
ISN'T LIVING HERE ANYMORE ?

46:01.200 --> 46:02.827
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

46:02.830 --> 46:04.457
I'M GLAD TAYLOR'S
NOT LIVING HERE ANYMORE.

46:04.460 --> 46:06.121
I DIDN'T ASK
FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY

46:06.130 --> 46:07.597
OF TAKING CARE OF A CHILD,
I DON'T WANT IT.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.057
I'M GLAD,
I HAVE MY LIFE BACK !

46:10.060 --> 46:12.221
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF TAKING CARE OF

46:12.230 --> 46:14.892
EVERYBODY ELSE'S
FUCKING PROBLEMS !

46:14.900 --> 46:16.094
OKAY.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.393
OH, GOD.

46:22.400 --> 46:23.549
I'M SORRY.

46:23.560 --> 46:26.256
I DON'T MEAN
TO TAKE IT OUT ON YOU.

46:27.900 --> 46:29.094
YOU CAN.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.795
I MEAN,
WE ALL NEED TO VENT.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.598
THAT'S JUST
PART OF IT, RIGHT ?

46:33.600 --> 46:34.919
YEAH.

46:34.930 --> 46:37.626
YOU CAN TELL ME
TO SHUT THE FUCK UP.

46:37.630 --> 46:41.623
I DON'T MIND, REALLY.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.225
I DO MISS HER.

46:49.230 --> 46:51.528
ME, TOO.

46:56.460 --> 46:58.257
YOU WANT
TO HAVE SEX ?

46:58.260 --> 47:00.091
SURE.

47:00.100 --> 47:02.728
I WANT TO DO IT
ON THE FLOOR.

47:02.730 --> 47:05.756
OKAY, LET ME JUST
PUT THESE GROCERIES AWAY.

47:19.860 --> 47:20.997
HEY.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.058
HEY.

47:22.060 --> 47:24.119
HOW WAS YOUR DAY ?

47:24.130 --> 47:26.257
IT WAS OKAY.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.898
LONG.

47:27.900 --> 47:29.925
YOU ?

47:29.930 --> 47:30.919
OKAY.

47:30.930 --> 47:32.454
I GOT A LOT
OF WRITING DONE.

47:32.460 --> 47:34.189
THAT'S GOOD.

47:36.400 --> 47:38.527
DID YOU EAT ?

47:40.630 --> 47:43.394
UH, NO,
NO, I DIDN'T.

47:43.400 --> 47:46.892
DO YOU WANT ME
TO FIX YOU SOMETHING ?

47:48.930 --> 47:50.795
NO, NO,
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

48:01.900 --> 48:03.094
WHAT'S THIS ?

48:03.100 --> 48:06.319
OH, SOME BOOK
EVERYONE'S RAVING ABOUT.

48:07.730 --> 48:09.220
YOU MET HIM ?

48:09.230 --> 48:11.255
NO, THAT BELONGS
TO MY MOM.

48:14.060 --> 48:16.597
(sighing )

48:24.430 --> 48:26.250
DEAR FRIENDS,

48:26.260 --> 48:28.353
IT WAS OUR LORD JESUS
HIMSELF WHO SAID,

48:28.360 --> 48:30.999
"COME TO ME, ALL YOU
WHO LABOR AND ARE BURDENED,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.252
"AND I WILL
GIVE YOU REST.

48:33.260 --> 48:36.457
"LET US PRAY, THEN, FOR
OUR BROTHER DWIGHT GARRISON,

48:36.460 --> 48:38.826
THAT HE MAY REST
FROM HIS LABORS."

48:38.830 --> 48:40.593
NATE, ARE YOU OKAY ?

48:40.600 --> 48:41.828
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

48:41.830 --> 48:43.320
YEAH, YEAH,
I JUST...

48:43.330 --> 48:47.926
DIDN'T SLEEP
A LOT LAST NIGHT.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.351
YOU'RE TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF, RIGHT ?

48:52.360 --> 48:55.056
YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR MEDICATION,

48:55.060 --> 48:57.426
NOT LETTING YOURSELF
GET TOO STRESSED OUT ?

48:57.430 --> 49:00.354
I'M DOING MY BEST.

49:03.400 --> 49:05.960
MRS. GARRISON, IS THERE
ANYTHING WE CAN DO ?

49:05.960 --> 49:07.359
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU.

49:07.360 --> 49:11.421
THE SERVICE
IS LOVELY.

49:11.430 --> 49:13.250
I'M PLEASED
YOU APPROVE.

49:13.260 --> 49:17.799
AND I ALSO WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAY I BEHAVED YESTERDAY.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.688
I WAS...

49:21.100 --> 49:22.897
I WAS JUST...

49:28.000 --> 49:30.218
I'M JUST
SO FUCKING ANGRY.

49:30.230 --> 49:32.152
HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE DIED.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.526
HE WAS STILL YOUNG.

49:34.530 --> 49:38.398
WE ONLY HAD
SIX YEARS TOGETHER.

49:38.400 --> 49:42.621
ONLY SIX YEARS.

49:44.660 --> 49:47.390
THAT'S MORE THAN
SOME PEOPLE HAVE.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.358
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

49:50.630 --> 49:52.848
I KNOW, I KNOW.

49:52.860 --> 49:55.658
I KNOW,
IT'S NEVER ENOUGH.

49:56.430 --> 49:58.227
( Nate )
I KNOW.

50:00.260 --> 50:01.898
OH!

50:01.900 --> 50:04.619
I WENT TO CEDAR GROVE,

50:04.630 --> 50:08.350
THE CRYPT NEXT TO DWIGHT
AND HIS WIFE'S WAS EMPTY,

50:08.360 --> 50:10.055
SO, I BOUGHT IT.

50:10.060 --> 50:11.049
REALLY ?

50:11.060 --> 50:14.621
YEAH, I STILL WANT
TO BURIED WITH HIM,

50:14.630 --> 50:17.758
OR NEXT TO HIM,
IF THAT'S ALL I CAN GET.

50:18.560 --> 50:20.096
THAT'S LOVELY.

50:21.660 --> 50:23.799
AND I DON'T WANT THOSE BITCHES
ANYWHERE NEAR HIM,

50:23.800 --> 50:25.688
SO I BOUGHT THE ONE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

50:25.700 --> 50:28.328
I'D LIKE TO COME IN ON MONDAY
AND MAKE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS

50:28.330 --> 50:31.788
IN ADVANCE, YOU KNOW,
LIKE HE DID.

50:31.800 --> 50:34.451
OF COURSE,
ANY TIME AFTER NINE.

50:34.460 --> 50:36.257
THANK YOU.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.391
YES, I DO HAVE
TELEMARKETING EXPERIENCE.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.459
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED ?

50:46.460 --> 50:50.726
I CAN'T COME THIS MORNING,
I HAVE A PREVIOUS APPOINTMENT,

50:50.730 --> 50:52.288
HOW ABOUT IF I COME
AROUND 2:30 ?

50:52.300 --> 50:55.053
OKAY, OKAY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

50:55.060 --> 50:56.425
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ?

50:56.430 --> 50:58.421
THANK YOU, MARTHA.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.989
HEY, HONEY,

51:02.000 --> 51:04.423
THANKS, BABY,
