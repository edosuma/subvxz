00:01.969 --> 00:04.269
¶ shot through the heart
and you're to blame ¶

00:04.271 --> 00:07.973
¶ darling, you give
love a bad name ¶

00:07.975 --> 00:11.043
(bon jovi's "you give love
a bad name" playing)

00:16.217 --> 00:18.817
Will:
<i>I'm living in a dream.</i>

00:18.819 --> 00:20.519
<i>Besides having</i>
<i>an unlimited budget,</i>

00:20.521 --> 00:21.620
<i>Kids recruited</i>
<i>from all over the world</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.055
<i>For their talent,</i>

00:23.057 --> 00:25.057
<i>A nutritionist,</i>
<i>costume designer</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:27.159
<i>And strength</i>
<i>and conditioning specialist,</i>

00:27.161 --> 00:29.161
<i>Being the coach</i>
<i>of vocal adrenaline</i>

00:29.163 --> 00:31.363
<i>Has a few other perks,</i>
<i>like this company car,</i>

00:31.365 --> 00:33.699
<i>My own massage therapist,</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:37.503
<i>And a paycheck so big, we moved</i>
<i>into a higher tax bracket.</i>

00:37.505 --> 00:41.040
¶ an angel's smile
is what you sell ¶

00:41.042 --> 00:43.375
¶ you promise me heaven ¶

00:43.377 --> 00:45.310
¶ then put me through hell ¶

00:45.312 --> 00:47.146
¶ chains of love ¶

00:47.148 --> 00:49.481
¶ got a hold on me ¶

00:49.483 --> 00:51.050
¶ when passion's a prison ¶

00:51.052 --> 00:54.486
¶ you can't break free, oh ¶

00:54.488 --> 00:57.156
¶ you're a loaded gun ¶

00:57.158 --> 00:58.857
<i>The kids are so committed.</i>

00:58.859 --> 01:00.926
<i>They start practice</i>
<i>on their own most days.</i>

01:00.928 --> 01:02.361
<i>I'll admit i do miss</i>

01:02.363 --> 01:04.763
<i>The camaraderie</i>
<i>of the new directions!</i>

01:04.765 --> 01:06.598
<i>It's every man</i>
<i>for himself here.</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:08.934
¶ you give love ¶

01:08.936 --> 01:11.437
¶ a bad name! ¶
¶<i> a bad name!</i> ¶

01:11.439 --> 01:14.239
<i>The alumni support is huge.</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:16.608
<i>Our boosters are</i>
<i>incredibly generous.</i>

01:16.610 --> 01:19.945
My wife says
this one is the best.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.914
Wow, really this is
so unnecessary.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.682
I was always
a football guy myself.

01:23.684 --> 01:26.585
But my flaming gay son
loves show choir.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.288
Ah.
And championships
are championships.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.223
So, i'm throwing
all my influence

01:31.225 --> 01:34.259
Behind vocal adrenaline.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.627
(both laugh)

01:35.629 --> 01:37.062
And we're all counting

01:37.064 --> 01:39.298
On another win this year,
mr. Schuester.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.802
Oh, i think as long
as you're happy

01:43.804 --> 01:45.971
And feeling good,
we support you.

01:45.973 --> 01:49.541
I mean, you need to just keep
being honest with yourself.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.943
The way i see it,
i'm playing the long game

01:50.945 --> 01:52.945
In terms of making
real changes there.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.813
I can't expect to go
in there and alter

01:54.815 --> 01:56.048
Their whole way
of doing things.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.883
My dream is to combine
the resources

01:57.885 --> 01:59.918
And support
of vocal adrenaline

01:59.920 --> 02:02.454
With the heart and inspiration
of the new directions!

02:02.456 --> 02:05.090
Well, if anybody can
do that, you can.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.960
Ah! What do you say
we let him out to play, huh?

02:07.962 --> 02:09.328
What-- here?
Oh, my god, no.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.662
He might touch something.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.432
Life is good.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.001
What?
(laughs)

02:16.003 --> 02:17.102
(gasps)
oh!

02:17.104 --> 02:18.604
Oh, my god!
What happened?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.506
Your team vocal adrenaline.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.307
They decided to go
with the tradition

02:22.309 --> 02:24.409
Of egging the competition.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.382
Aah!

02:40.261 --> 02:42.327
(vocal adrenaline yelling)

02:43.964 --> 02:45.998
You suck!

02:48.969 --> 02:52.171
(school bell ringing)

02:52.173 --> 02:54.439
Okay. So, i've heard
from my friends

02:54.441 --> 02:55.874
Rachel berry
and blaine anderson,

02:55.876 --> 02:58.110
The coaches of the new
directions! And the warblers,

02:58.112 --> 02:59.711
That they were egged

02:59.713 --> 03:02.681
By my kids the other day
on the way to their cars.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.849
Come on, guys!

03:03.851 --> 03:05.484
I have to put my foot down!

03:05.486 --> 03:07.019
This kind of bullying
will not be tolerated!

03:07.021 --> 03:08.320
Hey, i think you're
being intolerant

03:08.322 --> 03:09.621
Of our intolerance, will.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.123
It's mr. Schuester.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.792
And don't be such
a smart-ass, clint.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.461
This week...

03:16.463 --> 03:17.996
We're gonna be taking turns
performing songs

03:17.998 --> 03:20.399
Dealing with the theme
of "tolerance."

03:20.401 --> 03:22.801
I will lead by example.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.137
And i've invited
a very special guest to join me.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.606
And a vocal adrenaline alumni.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.811
(macklemore and ryan lewis'
"same love" begins)

03:35.149 --> 03:37.983
¶ when i was in the third grade,
i thought that i was gay ¶

03:37.985 --> 03:39.585
¶ 'cause i could draw,
my uncle was ¶

03:39.587 --> 03:41.220
¶ and i kept my room straight ¶

03:41.222 --> 03:43.822

03:43.824 --> 03:46.558
¶ she's like, "will, you loved
girls since before pre-k ¶

03:46.560 --> 03:49.728
¶ trippin'," yeah, i guess
she had a point, didn't she? ¶

03:49.730 --> 03:52.064
¶ bunch of stereotypes
all in my head ¶

03:52.066 --> 03:54.032
¶ i remember doing
the math like yeah ¶

03:54.034 --> 03:56.568
¶ i'm good at little league,
a preconceived idea ¶

03:56.570 --> 03:58.770
¶ of what it all meant
for those that liked ¶

03:58.772 --> 04:00.706
¶ the same sex,
had the characteristics ¶

04:00.708 --> 04:03.575
¶ the right wing conservatives
think it's a decision ¶

04:03.577 --> 04:06.245
¶ and you can be cured with
some treatment and religion ¶

04:06.247 --> 04:10.282
¶ man-made rewiring of a
predisposition playing god ¶

04:10.284 --> 04:12.451
¶ yeah, yeah ¶
¶ aw, nah, here we go ¶

04:12.453 --> 04:15.220
¶ america the brave still fears
what we don't know ¶

04:15.222 --> 04:18.257
¶ and god loves all his children
is somehow forgotten, but we ¶

04:18.259 --> 04:21.193
¶ paraphrase a book written
3,500 years ago ¶

04:21.195 --> 04:23.262
¶ i don't know ¶

04:23.264 --> 04:27.633
¶ and i can't change
even if i tried ¶

04:27.635 --> 04:30.135
¶ even if i wanted to ¶

04:30.137 --> 04:32.304

¶ my love, she keeps me warm ¶

04:52.626 --> 04:54.660
¶ oh, whoa! ¶

04:54.662 --> 04:58.030
¶ love is kind. ¶
¶ love is kind. ¶

05:01.769 --> 05:03.735
What the hell was that,
schuester?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.770
You can't be serious.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.071
Serious as a hangnail, honey.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.739
Shut up, stop rapping

05:07.741 --> 05:09.508
And let us rehearse
for sectionals.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.010
We don't care about
gay or straight

05:12.012 --> 05:13.478
Or trans or intersects.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.247
We care about winning.
No, wait.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.748
This is genius.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.517
If we can get the new
directions! Worked up

05:18.519 --> 05:21.253
Into thinking we're intolerant
of an entire group of people,

05:21.255 --> 05:22.688
They'll go
into will schuester mode.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.289
And dedicate an
entire week of practice

05:24.291 --> 05:25.324
To a lesson about tolerance.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.858
Hey!

05:26.860 --> 05:28.427
This behavior is over.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.195
Yes, you are talented.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.630
No, that does not
give you the right

05:31.632 --> 05:32.698
To behave however you want.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.366
Now, like it or not,
i am running

05:34.368 --> 05:36.868
This show choir now,
and i'm gonna run it how i like.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.006
Man:
<i>Well, mckinley, this is it.</i>

05:41.008 --> 05:43.608
<i>It took a long time</i>
<i>to get here.</i>

05:43.610 --> 05:46.645
<i>And my heart's racing like a</i>
<i>slow pig at a sausage factory.</i>

05:46.647 --> 05:49.214
<i>But i can truly say that today</i>

05:49.216 --> 05:51.283
<i>I'm living the life</i>
<i>i always wanted.</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:55.320
<i>I took some time off</i>

05:55.322 --> 05:57.856
<i>To let my outsides catch up</i>
<i>with my insides.</i>

05:57.858 --> 06:01.560
<i>But now i'm ready to take</i>
<i>this old jalopy for a spin.</i>

06:01.562 --> 06:03.895
<i>So...</i>

06:03.897 --> 06:07.199
<i>Say hello</i>
<i>to coach sheldon beiste.</i>

06:09.002 --> 06:10.635
Sue:
Coach!

06:10.637 --> 06:11.903
Welcome back!
You know, from a distance,

06:11.905 --> 06:14.039
I almost mistook you
for an aging

06:14.041 --> 06:16.174
Yet virile james garner.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.476
Oh, thanks, sue.
Mm-hmm.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.010
It's-it's good to be back.
Coach!

06:19.012 --> 06:20.212
It is so good to have
you back and in true form.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.413
Oh, my gosh!

06:21.415 --> 06:22.681
We got so much guy talk
to catch up on

06:22.683 --> 06:24.149
That we never even
got to do before.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.184
Like, uh, about me and rachel

06:26.186 --> 06:28.253
And then mercedes,
i talked to her, we're cool.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.855
You're fine, sam.
Just take a breath

06:29.857 --> 06:31.390
So you don't black out on me.

06:31.392 --> 06:32.391
Hey, coach,
i want you to know

06:32.393 --> 06:33.425
That i've taken steps

06:33.427 --> 06:34.559
To battle the scourge

06:34.561 --> 06:36.027
Of cisnormativity

06:36.029 --> 06:38.029
Uh-huh.
And transmisogyny.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.564
And some other terms
i had never heard of

06:39.566 --> 06:41.767
Until i did a quick wikipedia
search this morning.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.069
Um, thanks, but i just
want things to go

06:44.071 --> 06:45.837
Right on back to normal.
Yeah, yeah.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.173
Oh, good 'cause i wro... Had
this list of all these pronouns.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.674
I mean, you just tell me
which one and i'll enforce it.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.209
There's he, there's sh-he,
there's it,

06:51.211 --> 06:53.845
Zhim, ze...

06:53.847 --> 06:56.882
I-i think he and him works fine.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.049
Now, coach, as you know,
i've always been

06:58.051 --> 06:59.451
Quite vocal about my opposition

06:59.453 --> 07:02.120
To bullying in any form.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.922
And i want you to know
that i am here for you

07:03.924 --> 07:06.792
As a friend, ally

07:06.794 --> 07:09.261
And a shoulder to cry on.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.896
Metaphorically, of course.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.964
Because you're a man now
and real men don't cry.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.933
Beiste: I got to say
i'm impressed, sue.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.102
I kind of figured someone
would say something.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.970
Or gawk at me funny or...

07:18.972 --> 07:20.038
Coach, you will
be happy to know

07:20.040 --> 07:21.273
That mckinley high is now

07:21.275 --> 07:23.909
A fully gender-fluid
high school.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.544
Wow.
All right?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.611
Now, if you'll excuse me,
out of the corner

07:26.613 --> 07:27.979
Of my eye i see a fatty

07:27.981 --> 07:30.215
Who could use a good,
healthy fat shaming.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.218
Hmm.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.319
Uh, well, you know,

07:34.321 --> 07:35.620
I should probably get going.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.322
Yeah, i got to go
meet rachel and, um...

07:37.324 --> 07:38.990
High five!

07:38.992 --> 07:41.059
Yeah, that's some strength, huh?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.630
(school bell ringing)

07:46.834 --> 07:48.667
Morning!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.068
What's wrong?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.436
Are you still upset
about getting egged

07:51.438 --> 07:52.571
And stuff?
No, sam, something happened.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.772
Something way worse.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.674
Early this morning,
i was fast asleep,

07:55.676 --> 07:57.175
And i was having
the most amazing dream

07:57.177 --> 07:58.276
That i was on broadway

07:58.278 --> 07:59.644
And there was all this pudding.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.313
And then i woke up
to this pounding!

08:01.315 --> 08:03.248
(banging nearby)

08:03.250 --> 08:06.017
<i>At first i thought it was just</i>
<i>a really big woodpecker.</i>

08:06.019 --> 08:07.853
<i>Or maybe a neighbor was</i>
<i>installing an in-ground pool.</i>

08:07.855 --> 08:10.355
<i>But then i saw what it was.</i>

08:13.861 --> 08:15.627
My dad sold our house!

08:15.629 --> 08:17.195
Wait, but isn't, isn't that a
good thing? You said it's

08:17.197 --> 08:19.097
Been on the market for a while
now, and every time they had

08:19.099 --> 08:20.432
An offer, the buyer just
backed out last minute.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.601
Yes! That's because
i was sabotaging it!

08:22.603 --> 08:24.436
The shower has vintage tile.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.770
(groaning)

08:25.772 --> 08:26.938
(screams)

08:26.940 --> 08:29.274
Rachel, that's insane.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.775
Sam, it's the only house
i've ever known.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.377
It's the house
that i grew up in.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.446
And-and i just really,
i-i hate the idea

08:34.448 --> 08:36.848
That in a couple of days
it's gonna be someone else's.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.017
All right, listen.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.052
As somebody who sometimes
didn't have any home at all...

08:41.054 --> 08:42.454
No. Mm-mm!

08:42.456 --> 08:44.222
Mm-mm! No way.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.957
I am not gonna let you guilt me

08:45.959 --> 08:48.460
Into going along with this
because you once were homeless!

08:48.462 --> 08:50.395
Okay? I'm sorry, but that has
nothing to do with this.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.864
I just... I'm not
ready to say good-bye.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.367
And i will be damned if i let
my dads go through with this.

08:57.838 --> 08:58.837
(chuckling):
Get off.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.238
Hey, guys, hey.
Thanks for coming.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.374
Oh, for the love of all
that's sacred, what now?

09:02.376 --> 09:05.176
Uh, well, i called you here
today because of rachel.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.245
Seriously? I just finished
mentoring that girl

09:07.247 --> 09:09.481
For, like, a week-- what could
she possibly need now?

09:09.483 --> 09:11.383
Do you want to...?
Her dads just sold their house.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.751
She has less than
a week to get out.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.386
That house means
everything to her.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.887
It's where she grew up.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.255
It's where she saw her dreams
become a reality and...

09:17.257 --> 09:18.723
Guys, this is a major
moment for her.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.492
Okay? She's becoming
a new person.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.193
Making one of the
biggest transitions of all.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.195
One that we are all
gonna have to make soon.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.697
Okay, just so we're clear,

09:25.699 --> 09:26.998
We're still talking
about rachel, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.500
Or are you announcing
your new gender?

09:28.502 --> 09:30.268
Oh, my god! No!
This is all about rachel!

09:30.270 --> 09:31.903
Look, guys, she's growing up.

09:31.905 --> 09:32.904
We all are.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.273
So, what's the plan, sam?

09:52.192 --> 09:53.692
(horn honking)

09:53.694 --> 09:55.160
(kids cheering, whooping)

10:05.272 --> 10:07.205
You wanted to see me?
Have a seat, william.

10:09.543 --> 10:12.544
Hey, sheldon.
How you doing?

10:12.546 --> 10:14.980
Wait, what's going on?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.548
It's not a big deal.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.917
Sue's just making
a big stink over nothing.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.986
America's newest male
sheldon beiste

10:20.988 --> 10:22.320
Arrived in our parking lot
yesterday

10:22.322 --> 10:24.389
To find his car vandalized

10:24.391 --> 10:25.824
With a horribly

10:25.826 --> 10:27.726
Offensive word.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.260
Oh, my god.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.996
That's terrible.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.731
Sheldon, i'm so sorry.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.232
It's all right.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.401
I knew that there was
a possibility

10:36.403 --> 10:37.936
That something like this
was gonna happen.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.172
So when it did,
i wasn't all that surprised.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.507
I-i'm sorry. Just, um,

10:42.509 --> 10:45.276
You-you said it
happened here, so

10:45.278 --> 10:46.578
What does this
have to do with me?

10:46.580 --> 10:47.979
Newly boobless,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.181
Would you like to tell him
or shall i?

10:50.183 --> 10:53.351
They wore carmel colors, will.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.986
They were from vocal adrenaline.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.388
They were your kids.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.690
Are you serious?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.694
No one goes after one

11:02.696 --> 11:04.329
Of my friends and
gets away with it.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.964
Except for me.
I always go after your friends,

11:05.966 --> 11:07.432
And i've never not gotten away
with it.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.000
(sighs)

11:09.002 --> 11:11.002
(school bell ringing)
i'm sorry.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.672
Okay, you guys, let's get
started on this week's lesson.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.273
It is called buckeye bull's-eye,

11:15.275 --> 11:18.276
Featuring all artists
from ohio!

11:18.278 --> 11:21.012
Marilyn manson
and dean martin...

11:21.014 --> 11:23.882
Actually, rachel, there has
been a slight change in plans.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.351
Kurt, you can't just change
the lesson like that.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.186
Well, sometimes life throws you
a curveball,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.554
And you just got to embrace it.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.122
That's why

11:31.124 --> 11:32.524
This week's lesson is...

11:32.526 --> 11:34.793
Transitioning.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.061
Changing.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.462
Charging forward.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.197
Rachel, it's come
to our attention

11:39.199 --> 11:40.465
That you're
having

11:40.467 --> 11:41.800
Some challenges
with saying good-bye

11:41.802 --> 11:43.034
To your childhood home.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.003
Which is forcing you
to say good-bye

11:45.005 --> 11:48.006
To your childhood
and fully accept adulthood.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.075
Or at least that's according
to the very nice lady

11:50.077 --> 11:51.876
At the lima
mental health clinic.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.179
Sam:
So to help rachel with
this new transition,

11:54.181 --> 11:57.649
We are throwing her a "farewell
to rachel's house" party,

11:57.651 --> 12:00.518
And everyone's invited.
It's going to be friday night
in rachel's basement.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.555
You guys, this is very
unnecessary but very sweet.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.090
Madison:
Wait, so this lesson isn't

12:05.092 --> 12:06.524
For us?
It's for rachel?

12:06.526 --> 12:08.960
Yeah, so shut up.
Fetch me
my wheel!

12:13.033 --> 12:16.534
Thank you. Welcome
to<i> wheel of musical fortune!</i>

12:16.536 --> 12:19.104
(applause)
thank you. Thank you.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.239
Everyone spins,
and whoever's name you land on,

12:21.241 --> 12:23.174
You have to sing a duet
with them at the party.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.909
All except for me. 'cause i told
you i want to sing with rachel.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.878
I don't want to chance it.
Fine. Whatever.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.580
Can't we just pick names
out of a hat?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.416
Shh.
Okay, i'll go first.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.753
Luck be a lady tonight!

12:39.192 --> 12:41.192
Roderick.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.861
Which-which one?

12:42.863 --> 12:45.563
Uh, me. I'm-i'm roderick.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.298
No, this is gonna be great.
You're great.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.534
Okay, my turn!

13:07.220 --> 13:10.221
Oh. Huh.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.992
Well, i thought for sure

13:13.994 --> 13:15.660
That wheel was gonna land
on artie's name.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.162
Yeah, what are the odds?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.763
Uh, ten to one.
Not that high.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.265
But you're totally cool
with singing with me, right?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.499
I-i understand if not.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.500
Yeah, no, i really want to.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.835
It's-it's just...

13:23.837 --> 13:26.004
If you see dave,

13:26.006 --> 13:27.672
Just don't bring it up, okay?

13:27.674 --> 13:29.307
Oh, come on. It's just a song.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.075
He can't be jealous from that.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.478
I know, but i think
that he thinks that there's...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.213
Still something between us.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.415
Which there...

13:37.417 --> 13:38.850
Obviously isn't.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.685
Obviously.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.423
Anyway, i'll call you. We'll
figure out what we're doing.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.758
We can do something up-tempo.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.992
Or-or slow.
It doesn't matter.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.027
I'm versatile.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.528
Okay. Cool.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.499
All right. I'll call you. Okay.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.940
(school bell ringing)

14:01.942 --> 14:04.642
Who was it? I just
heard. I want names.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.878
Which one of those vocal
adrenaline bastards did it?

14:06.880 --> 14:09.781
What the fall leaves
are you talking about, pumpkin?
Your car,

14:09.783 --> 14:12.350
The vandalism. Which one of
those rock lobsters was it?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.619
It doesn't matter.
We're gonna kill those guys,
coach.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.955
No, you're not gonna kill
anybody. You boys sit down.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.022
Sit down!

14:21.161 --> 14:24.229
I don't want you guys doing
anything about this,

14:24.231 --> 14:26.030
You hear me? It's been handled.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.299
It's real sweet
that you guys care,

14:28.301 --> 14:30.034
But hurting him
isn't gonna fix anything.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.036
It'll teach them not
to mess with any of us

14:32.038 --> 14:33.738
Or we'll destroy them.

14:33.740 --> 14:37.408
(sighs)
i've been dealing
with ignorant people

14:37.410 --> 14:39.410
Who couldn't understand me
my whole life.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.680
But you know what? I couldn't be
happier with myself.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.316
How many people get
to say that? And, spencer,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.051
I'm glad to hear you say
that you're one of us.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.254
That's all
i've ever wanted to hear

14:49.256 --> 14:52.590
From you, is that you're more
than just a star player

14:52.592 --> 14:55.059
But that you're really part
of this team.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.895
And, sam,
you did that.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.930
You united us.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.332
You're a hell of a
coach and a friend.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.168
And if one good thing can come
out of this whole mess,

15:04.170 --> 15:06.738
Well, then they gave us
the best freaking gift

15:06.740 --> 15:08.072
In the whole world.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.007
(chuckles)

15:09.009 --> 15:10.675
Coach, look, i'm sorry.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.076
I didn't... I didn't mean
to disappoint you.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.611
I just...

15:13.613 --> 15:15.179
I can't stand
to see my friends get hurt.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.015
I know that, sam.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.883
And you did not disappoint me.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.619
In fact, i couldn't be prouder.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.255
You boys get back to practice.

15:33.900 --> 15:36.634
This is completely unacceptable.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.770
I can handle insubordination,

15:38.772 --> 15:40.772
But this, this isn't about me.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.641
This is about teaching you
to act like human beings.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.977
It's about knowing
that your-your common decency

15:45.979 --> 15:48.313
And integrity
are-are more important

15:48.315 --> 15:50.315
Than winning
show choir competitions.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.550
Which perfectly sums up
your teaching style, schuester.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.386
You think all of us didn't know
you were too soft for this job?

15:55.388 --> 15:57.488
You have
a loser mentality.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.490
You know who didn't give a crap
about being kind?

15:59.492 --> 16:02.093
Lewis and clark.
George patton. Paul anka.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.162
I don't want to be decent or
liked. I want to be a champion.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.463
And this is how it's done.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.631
The fact is

16:06.633 --> 16:08.066
Vocal adrenaline is the last

16:08.068 --> 16:10.068
Of a great dying breed
of communities

16:10.070 --> 16:12.136
That is willing
to risk being called bad guys

16:12.138 --> 16:13.938
And accept
the hard truth,

16:13.940 --> 16:16.908
Which is that every person
on the planet knows

16:16.910 --> 16:18.643
Winning is everything.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.746
(cheering)
we will win nationals,

16:21.748 --> 16:24.449
But we'll win it
the right way.
When will you just accept

16:24.451 --> 16:26.184
That you don't
belong here,

16:26.186 --> 16:27.752
That none of us like you,

16:27.754 --> 16:29.587
That we make fun
of your vests

16:29.589 --> 16:31.489
And your pep talks
behind your back?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.992
You're a joke.
Yeah, well, the
joke's on you, clint.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.594
You're off the team.
(scoffs)

16:36.596 --> 16:38.463
You can't kick me
off the team.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.498
I am the team!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.667
Get out.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.569
Now.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.712
Okay.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.181
Everybody warm up.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.692
(grunts)
hey, come to bed, will. Oh.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.194
Maybe just have a shower first
because you're touching

17:10.196 --> 17:11.696
That wheel
that touched the ground.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.531
You would think a stroller
that costs as much

17:13.533 --> 17:16.467
As a mortgage payment would not
break a week after you got it.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.137
Okay.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.706
You're talking
in your angry man voice.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.974
(sighs)

17:22.976 --> 17:24.175
I'm sorry.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.178
It's just...
(sighs)

17:27.180 --> 17:29.680
I'm stuck.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.050
I really don't
like my job.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.485
I don't like the people
or the environment, and
it's not gonna change

17:34.487 --> 17:36.421
Because they don't think
there's anything wrong.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.189
I kicked that kid
off the team today,

17:38.191 --> 17:39.924
But i know
that's not the end of it.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.160
Those boosters are gonna come
after me.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.695
Okay, well, look,
i don't need any of this stuff.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.564
It's not like we'd have
to go on food stamps

17:46.566 --> 17:47.999
If you quit
and found another job.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.568
I know some teachers who are.
(sighs)

17:50.570 --> 17:53.571
And we've talked about this,
emma. There are no other jobs.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.573
Not ones
where i can coach show choir.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.909
(sighs)
you know what the
worst part is?

17:57.911 --> 18:01.079
I love all this extra stuff.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.282
I love my fancy car
and fancy stroller

18:04.284 --> 18:05.716
And fancy football tickets.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.886
Maybe that makes me shallow
and immature, but...

18:08.888 --> 18:13.191
All this extra stuff makes me
feel like more of a man.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.593
And i hate myself
for loving it so much

18:15.595 --> 18:18.029
That i would stay working
at a place

18:18.031 --> 18:21.032
That stands for everything
i stand against.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.234
Okay. So we'll manage.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.570
You know?
You'll find another job.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.572
My pamphlet of the month club
is starting

18:27.574 --> 18:29.974
To bring in some extra cash.

18:29.976 --> 18:33.411
A year ago, i would have.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.246
(scoffs)
you can be principled

18:35.248 --> 18:37.582
When you don't have kids to feed
and clothe.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.417
Well, i think when you have kids

18:39.419 --> 18:41.886
Is when it's most important
to be principled.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.224
He's gonna be watching you,
will.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.392
(sighs)
kids see
everything.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.261
You can't hide
anything from them.

18:50.263 --> 18:53.164
I mean,
when you buy him something,

18:53.166 --> 18:54.999
He's gonna see your pride
and your shame.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.767
He's gonna know
when you traded your integrity

18:56.769 --> 18:58.469
For comfort and safety.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.807
Look, i'm not saying
that you have to quit your job.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.644
I understand the realities
of that. I do.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.080
But i am saying...

19:09.082 --> 19:12.416
You need to make a peace with
whatever choice you do make.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.253
Okay?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.788
Yeah.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.625
(whirring)
(indistinct chatter)

19:20.627 --> 19:23.528
Snuck a little something extra
in there for you, kurt.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.767
Artie:
Hello, everyone. Welcome
and thank you for coming

19:29.769 --> 19:33.137
To a "final farewell to rachel's
childhood home" party!

21:34.727 --> 21:36.894
(cheering and applause)

21:38.765 --> 21:41.232
(music playing in distance)

21:42.502 --> 21:44.068
Wow.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.971
The rachel berry
childhood bedroom.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.240
Is it weird to think
that someday this room's

21:49.242 --> 21:51.242
Gonna be re-created
in some broadway museum?

21:51.244 --> 21:53.244
Hopefully with
animatronic robots.

21:53.246 --> 21:54.912
You said you wouldn't
make fun of it.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.847
Sam:
Oh, man, is that
from<i> rocky horror?</i>

21:56.849 --> 21:59.784
Do you remember when i had to
wear those tight gold shorts?

21:59.786 --> 22:01.619
I think
everyone remembers that.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.121
Wow.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.023
You can't do it, can you?

22:06.025 --> 22:07.625
I mean,

22:07.627 --> 22:09.460
Almost everything else
is boxed up, but

22:09.462 --> 22:11.495
You haven't even
touched this wall.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.766
All my best memories from
high school are on that wall.

22:15.768 --> 22:19.637
My whole childhood
i just spent in this room

22:19.639 --> 22:22.540
Singing and dreaming, all alone

22:22.542 --> 22:24.342
With pictures
of barbra streisand

22:24.344 --> 22:26.677
And patti lupone
and bernadette peters.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.013
But then i met you
guys and suddenly

22:29.015 --> 22:31.015
The wall started to fill
up with real friends

22:31.017 --> 22:33.017
And real dreams.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.319
I don't know. Everything's
just so clear in high school

22:35.321 --> 22:38.356
And i'm supposed to just
pack it all up now?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.125
We're gonna need
a bigger wall.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.028
Mm...<i> Star wars.</i>

22:44.030 --> 22:45.529
It's... It's<i> jaws.</i>

22:45.531 --> 22:49.066
Oh.
Geez, what were you,
raised by monks?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.135
Come here.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.674
The wall
doesn't go away.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.543
The wall just
gets... Bigger.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.012
And higher

23:02.014 --> 23:04.815
And plastered
in dreams.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.753
You're going to
get that part.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.089
And you're going
back to new york.

23:12.091 --> 23:14.358
And you're taking
that wall with you.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.860
And if i'm real
lucky, then

23:15.862 --> 23:17.862
I'll always be
on it somewhere,

23:17.864 --> 23:20.030
Wearing incredibly tight,

23:20.032 --> 23:22.099
Sparkly gold shorts.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.226
Whoa!
(whooping) yeah.
Thank you. Good job.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.228
Just when you thought
we couldn't get any more

23:51.230 --> 23:52.630
Warmth and love in a basement,

23:52.632 --> 23:53.764
It's time
to bring out

23:53.766 --> 23:55.099
Your two
favorite gays,

23:55.101 --> 23:56.267
Kurt hummel and

23:56.269 --> 23:58.302
Blaine anderson.

"somebody loves you" begins)

26:10.836 --> 26:12.503
Are you sure
you have to go?

26:12.505 --> 26:13.837
Doesn't sound like
we're done in there.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.539
I-i wish i could,
but dave and i--

26:15.541 --> 26:17.608
We have to wake up
at 5:00 a.M. Sharp

26:17.610 --> 26:19.276
For the intramural football game
in bowling green.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.879
Well, anyway, i had a lot
of fun singing with you tonight.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.214
I thought we
sounded pretty good.
I thought we sounded incredible.

26:24.216 --> 26:26.517
We haven't sounded that good
since the very first duet

26:26.519 --> 26:29.453
That we did. Do you
remember what it was?
No, i'm blanking.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.556
I'm kidding, of course i do.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.058
It was
"baby, it's cold outside."

26:34.060 --> 26:35.960
The entire time we were singing,
i just wanted

26:35.962 --> 26:37.561
To turn off that damn boom box

26:37.563 --> 26:39.229
And confess
my undying love for you

26:39.231 --> 26:40.965
And give you the world's
most passionate kiss.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.533
Oh, yeah? Well,
why didn't you?

26:42.535 --> 26:45.035
I wasn't sure if you
felt the same way.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.037
And you didn't.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.907
Remember that guy you had a
crush on? The assistant manager

26:49.909 --> 26:52.943
To the gap? The... What was
his name? Um, uh, jonathan,

26:52.945 --> 26:54.812
Or, uh, jebediah?
Jer-jeremiah.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.080
Jeremiah.

26:56.082 --> 26:57.314
Yeah, whatever happened to him?

26:57.316 --> 27:00.117
I have no clue.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.653
Mm. It's funny
how someone could mean

27:02.655 --> 27:05.055
So much to you
at one point in time, and then

27:05.057 --> 27:06.624
A few years go by and...

27:17.103 --> 27:20.004
(cyndi lauper's

29:09.615 --> 29:12.349

29:12.351 --> 29:14.017

29:14.019 --> 29:17.054

29:17.056 --> 29:19.256

29:19.258 --> 29:21.625

29:21.627 --> 29:24.528

29:34.306 --> 29:37.841
¶ time after
time. ¶

29:54.794 --> 29:56.860
(mouthing)

29:59.064 --> 30:01.131
(footsteps approaching)

30:04.937 --> 30:08.071
As i live and breathe.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.808
(laughs):
Unique. Oh, girl.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.609
How come you didn't call
me? I had to find out

30:12.611 --> 30:14.278
My trans-gossip
from will schuester.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.613
You're right.
I should have called.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.615
I just didn't know
what to say to people.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.451
You know? It's all been
a bit overwhelming.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.987
Being back at mckinley
or the surgery?

30:23.989 --> 30:26.256
About being myself, you know?

30:26.258 --> 30:27.624
Trying to fit in.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.193
You know, i did this

30:29.195 --> 30:31.795
Because i needed to follow
how i felt inside.

30:31.797 --> 30:35.666
And i finally feel
so normal inside.

30:35.668 --> 30:38.168
(sighs)
but...

30:38.170 --> 30:40.437
Nobody's treating me
like i am normal.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.773
That's because you're
not normal. You're special.

30:42.775 --> 30:44.975
And not because
of some surgery, but

30:44.977 --> 30:46.510
Because you're
brave enough to go out

30:46.512 --> 30:48.011
And get something
when you want it.

30:48.013 --> 30:51.181
I don't want to always

30:51.183 --> 30:53.483
Be special, though.
Does that make sense?

30:53.485 --> 30:55.285
I just want to be
one of the guys.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.322
But there's
no one else like me here.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.457
You know, people
either fawn over me

31:00.459 --> 31:03.126
Or they hate me because
they don't understand me.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.700
Can i ask you something?

31:09.702 --> 31:12.469
Did it hurt?
(soft laugh)
are you joking?

31:12.471 --> 31:15.639
Like a bucket of hammers
being dumped on my chest.

31:15.641 --> 31:16.740
(laughs)

31:16.742 --> 31:19.009
But the weird thing--
it felt like

31:19.011 --> 31:21.078
They never should have been
there in the first place.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.846
Do you have any regrets?

31:22.848 --> 31:25.182
Not for a second.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.184
That feeling of relief
i have now

31:27.186 --> 31:29.186
Of finally being who
i've always wanted to be--

31:29.188 --> 31:31.188
It's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

31:31.190 --> 31:33.323
I just...

31:33.325 --> 31:36.793
I wish sometimes i wasn't
going through it all alone.

31:39.064 --> 31:40.964
You're not alone.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.704
Hey, mr. Schuester,

31:47.706 --> 31:49.740
I'm not sure if you heard,
but when jimbo wilson

31:49.742 --> 31:52.242
Found out that you kicked me
off the team, he threw a tizzy

31:52.244 --> 31:54.344
And told principal
gunderson to reinstate me.

31:54.346 --> 31:57.014
If you have
a problem with that--

31:57.016 --> 31:59.516
And i hope you do--

31:59.518 --> 32:01.451
Jimbo says
to call him personally.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.587
I don't have
a problem with that.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.390
He's right.
And i was wrong.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.725
You are this team.
You represent

32:08.727 --> 32:10.060
Everything this
place stands for,

32:10.062 --> 32:11.862
And i have put
my personal beliefs

32:11.864 --> 32:14.631
Ahead of the reality
of what vocal adrenaline is.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.433
To be honest,

32:16.435 --> 32:19.269
I was thinking about quitting.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.705
But then i realized
i still may be able

32:21.707 --> 32:23.373
To teach you guys
a thing or two.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.575
That said,
you certainly

32:25.577 --> 32:27.411
Have found the
formula to winning.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.146
Who am i to try to change that?

32:29.148 --> 32:30.814
So as long as
i'm coaching here,

32:30.816 --> 32:33.050
We win the v.A. Way.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.885
Yeah!
Yeah!

32:34.887 --> 32:36.486
That's what
i'm talking about.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.488
And to prove to you
guys that i'm serious,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.658
I have come up with a prank
to end all pranks.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.827
Bring it in.
Tonight,

32:43.829 --> 32:46.096
We sneak into mckinley high,

32:46.098 --> 32:48.432
And i will show you all
that nobody understands

32:48.434 --> 32:52.269
Psychological warfare
better than william schuester.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.805
All:
Yeah! (whooping)

32:54.807 --> 32:58.108
You know, i told them if they
put that clumsy, fat-ass craig

32:58.110 --> 33:00.477
On defense we'd blow the game,
and what do they do?

33:00.479 --> 33:02.512
They put that clumsy,
fat-ass craig

33:02.514 --> 33:05.415
On defense, right?
It's unbelievable.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.756
Okay. What?

33:13.926 --> 33:15.826
Oh, what's what?

33:15.828 --> 33:17.327
Whatever it is
that you've been staring

33:17.329 --> 33:18.829
Into space over for days.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.364
I mean, you've said,
like, two words.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.832
Sorry.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.870
Something happened that night
at rachel's party, didn't it?

33:28.007 --> 33:29.873
I sang a duet with kurt.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.842
It was rachel's
idea, okay?

33:31.844 --> 33:33.643
It was, uh...
It was a silly glee club thing.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.213
I don't even know why i
haven't told you about it.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.949
Why would i be upset
that you sang a duet with kurt?

33:38.951 --> 33:41.351
You guys don't stop singing.
That's not it.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.723
Oh, man.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.692
Dave...

33:48.694 --> 33:50.927
Just tell me one thing.

33:52.965 --> 33:56.033
Did he kiss you,
or did you kiss him?

34:00.039 --> 34:01.805
I knew it.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.976
(laughs)

34:05.978 --> 34:07.644
(sighs)

34:07.646 --> 34:10.347
Well... Guess i was lucky enough

34:10.349 --> 34:12.682
To get a couple months
in with you, huh?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.418
What does that mean?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.553
It means you still love him.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.088
You never stopped.

34:18.090 --> 34:20.357
Ever since kurt came back
to lima,

34:20.359 --> 34:22.526
There's been this ticking clock
hanging over us.

34:22.528 --> 34:24.694
Time's up.

34:24.696 --> 34:27.330
I'm sorry, dave.
I-i didn't mean to...

34:27.332 --> 34:29.599
It's okay. It's okay. I know.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.002
Hey...

34:32.004 --> 34:34.671
No hard feelings, okay?

34:34.673 --> 34:37.941
And you know that clumsy,
fat-ass craig?

34:37.943 --> 34:41.111
He tried to slip me
his number at the game.

34:41.113 --> 34:42.712
(laughs)

34:42.714 --> 34:44.714
Look, there's a whole world

34:44.716 --> 34:47.784
Of guys out there
waiting to be my rebound.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.587
Go.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.789
It's okay. Go. Tell kurt.

34:58.030 --> 34:59.529
Uh, just do me a favor?

35:01.033 --> 35:03.733
Don't sing it.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.335
Just say it.

35:18.383 --> 35:20.450
¶ ¶

35:40.339 --> 35:41.771
Oh. Hi, blaine.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.206
Uh, we were just leaving.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.910
Oh, walter,
this is blaine.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.578
Ah. Of course.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.280
(chuckles)
<i>the</i> blaine.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.449
Always nice to put
a face to the name.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.551
Ooh. Neat bowtie.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.488
I'm sorry.
Were you looking for me?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.491
No. Uh, i was just looking
for rachel.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.993
I-i wanted
to tell her something.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.494
Oh, hey, blaine.

36:04.496 --> 36:05.929
Did you want to
ask me something?

36:05.931 --> 36:07.864
Uh, wh-where's
everybody going?

36:07.866 --> 36:09.633
Oh, we're going
on a double date.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.768
Walter and i have
a shared love for musical flops.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.104
Oh, yeah. And walter
and i had this mutual love

36:14.106 --> 36:15.839
For the delicious chicken parm
dipping balls

36:15.841 --> 36:17.207
They got at breadstix.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.475
Oh, my gosh,
they're so delicious.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.976
Well, next time, maybe
you can bring karofsky,

36:19.978 --> 36:22.379
And we'll triple-date it.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.514
Oh, hey, did you want
to ask me something?

36:24.516 --> 36:27.951
You know what? I forgot.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.220
Okay.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.667
Okay, here's my plan.
We're gonna go backstage

36:43.669 --> 36:46.169
Where i've left two
boxes of k-y jelly tubes.

36:46.171 --> 36:48.138
All right? Everyone grab a tube

36:48.140 --> 36:50.874
And squirt out every last drop
onto the stage floor.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.375
All right, everyone, huddle up.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.477
We're gonna watch

36:54.479 --> 36:57.147
Those fools literally
fall on their faces.

36:57.149 --> 36:58.415
(laughter)

36:58.417 --> 37:00.884
(lights clack on)

37:02.221 --> 37:05.989
Unique:

39:44.549 --> 39:47.450
(applause and cheering)

40:06.671 --> 40:08.772
Clint:
I knew you were
full of crap.

40:08.774 --> 40:10.940
Your little "kumbaya" lesson
here cost us two hours

40:10.942 --> 40:12.675
Of valuable rehearsal
time, and you can bet

40:12.677 --> 40:15.545
The booster association
is gonna hear about it.

40:15.547 --> 40:17.113
You know, i started teaching
glee club

40:17.115 --> 40:19.015
Because i care about the arts.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.384
And that means a lot more
than just practicing 24/7

40:21.386 --> 40:23.186
Like militant robots.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.588
It means finding
yourself in the music,

40:25.590 --> 40:28.391
And sometimes it means taking a
week off of sectionals practice

40:28.393 --> 40:31.227
To do something
to make your friend feel good.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.363
At least that's what it meant
when i worked at mckinley.

40:33.365 --> 40:35.632
And i'm not willing
to sacrifice that anymore.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.734
So if you guys want to continue

40:37.736 --> 40:40.637
To be intolerant
troublemakers, go for it,

40:40.639 --> 40:43.840
Because i quit.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.610
You can't do that, will.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.879
I just did,
and it's not because of you.

40:49.881 --> 40:52.215
It's because
unique came to me, and

40:52.217 --> 40:55.084
We spent all week gathering
a transgender choir,

40:55.086 --> 40:56.886
300 voices strong

40:56.888 --> 41:00.223
To make you feel welcomed
and at home.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.961
(horn toots, microphone squeaks)

41:04.963 --> 41:07.897
Attention,
vocal adrenaline members,

41:07.899 --> 41:10.433
I will give you six minutes
to leave campus

41:10.435 --> 41:12.502
Before i unleash my hounds.

41:12.504 --> 41:14.804
Also, i've slashed
all the tires on your bus

41:14.806 --> 41:16.439
So you'll have to walk home.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.943
Perhaps you can use
this march of death opportunity

41:19.945 --> 41:23.246
To consider how awful
you really are.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.149
(dogs barking)

41:32.424 --> 41:34.824
So what are you
gonna do now?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.659
I don't know.

41:36.661 --> 41:39.696
I mean, i guess i have
to eventually find a new job,

41:39.698 --> 41:41.931
But, honestly,
carmel paid so well

41:41.933 --> 41:44.601
That we have enough savings
to last a few months,

41:44.603 --> 41:47.003
So i can figure things out.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.506
(sighs)

41:51.276 --> 41:54.711
I am honestly so proud of
what you guys are doing here.

41:54.713 --> 41:58.715
And if i ever doubted that there
needed to be somebody out there

41:58.717 --> 42:01.351
To balance out the evil
empire of vocal adrenaline,

42:01.353 --> 42:03.086
I am a true believer now.

42:04.723 --> 42:07.123
Well, there is a job.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.992
It doesn't really pay much.

42:08.994 --> 42:11.027
Actually, it doesn't
pay anything at all,

42:11.029 --> 42:13.329
But, well, kurt
and i were wondering

42:13.331 --> 42:16.466
If-if you had the time, or
if you would even consider

42:16.468 --> 42:19.035
Being the special
alumni consultant

42:19.037 --> 42:20.837
For the new directions!?

42:20.839 --> 42:23.006
Did you just make up
that title right now?

42:23.008 --> 42:24.374
Yes, i just made
that up right now.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.075
I absolutely did.
Yeah.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.745
But kurt and i were talking, and
we could really use your help.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.313
Coming up with these
weekly lessons

42:30.315 --> 42:31.881
Is a lot harder
than we thought.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.083
Okay.

42:34.085 --> 42:37.420
Okay, as in,
you'll think about it?

42:37.422 --> 42:41.024
No. Okay, as in,
i would be honored to help.

42:41.026 --> 42:42.825
That's great. (laughs)

42:42.827 --> 42:45.995
But i have, uh,
two conditions.

42:45.997 --> 42:49.165
One-- you guys have to make all
of the major decisions.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.601
And two-- you both have
to start calling me will.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.036
Yes, i can definitely do that.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.737
Kurt:
No. I don't think

42:54.739 --> 42:57.240
I could ever call you
"will." that... No.
(laughs)

42:57.242 --> 42:59.075
I...
Ah. I mean,

42:59.077 --> 43:01.678
You guys are just passing
through this place again,

43:01.680 --> 43:05.381
But i'm beginning to realize
that this is where i belong.

43:05.383 --> 43:06.783
This choir room is who i am.

43:06.785 --> 43:08.952
And i can't wait
to see the look

43:08.954 --> 43:10.453
On sue's face when i tell her.
(laughs)

43:10.455 --> 43:12.021
So, what's the lesson
for next week?

43:12.023 --> 43:13.923
Well, kurt wants to do another
britney 3.0,

43:13.925 --> 43:16.259
But, honestly, there's no more
songs left in her catalog.

43:16.261 --> 43:19.062
There are tons of songs.
Well, no-- do the kids have
any personal problems?

43:19.064 --> 43:20.697
We don't really know.

43:20.699 --> 43:22.799
We don't spend too much
time talking to them.

43:22.801 --> 43:24.767
Well, you should.
Get to know them.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.470
Because one day, they may be the
best friends you've ever had.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.539
