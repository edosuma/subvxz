WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.703
(siren wailing,
overlapping chatter)

00:02.736 --> 00:05.673
Multiple gunshot wounds.
BP's 84/53 and dropping.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.508
MAN:
Prep the trauma team, let's get
him in the O.R. right now.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.478
(indistinct conversations)

00:12.713 --> 00:14.215
(music playing)

00:14.248 --> 00:16.117
WOMAN:
What's going on?

00:16.150 --> 00:17.651
WOMAN 2:
What's happening?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.489
(excited chattering)

00:21.522 --> 00:23.157
DISTORTED MALE VOICE:
Greetings, City Mercy.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.426
You have played God long enough.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.428
We are Grey Ruin
and have taken control

00:27.461 --> 00:30.298
of your hospital
and its devices.

00:30.331 --> 00:34.368
Pay us $5 million, or four hours
from now, another patient dies.

00:35.803 --> 00:36.604
They said
"another patient."

00:36.637 --> 00:37.771
Does that mean
they've killed someone?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.307
I want every bed checked.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.241
Notify hospital security
and Dallas Police.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.776
Stay calm, everybody,
we're handling this.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.812
(excited chattering continues)

00:47.115 --> 00:50.084
MAN: We've got 20 more patients
to check in maternity.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.353
MAN 2:
Checking ophthalmology.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.555
WOMAN:
Cardio ward is good.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.091
MAN 3: 413 through 427,
all patients are alive.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.526
WOMAN 2:
Checking oncology.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.695
WOMAN 3:
Everyone in ICU is fine.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.696
MAN 4:
West Wing is clear.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.432
Someone check neuro.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.366
MAN 5: Last patient
to check into ortho.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.401
WOMAN 4: Okay, that's it
for the East Wing.

01:09.303 --> 01:10.738
Hey, what's going on?
What is this?

01:10.771 --> 01:12.440
We're taking care of it, sir.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.775
Right now, my concern
is your wife, Mr. Mullen.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.782
Code blue!

01:21.815 --> 01:23.751
MULLEN: What do you
mean "code blue"?
Step back, sir.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.319
Please keep him back.
Lindsey? What's wrong?

01:25.353 --> 01:26.554
Okay, charge
it to 200.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.655
Lindsey!

01:27.688 --> 01:29.123
Clear.

01:29.157 --> 01:31.125
MULLEN: She just
has a broken leg.
DOCTOR: Pulse!

01:31.159 --> 01:32.426
MULLEN:
What are you doing?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.894
Again, 250 this time.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.463
What are you
doing to her?!
Clear!

01:36.497 --> 01:38.532
Pulse.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.771
MULLEN: Why are they doing that?
What's wrong with her?
Come on.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.807
MULLEN:
Lindsey!
Dr. Marks.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.377
Dr. Marks.

01:49.410 --> 01:51.379
Dr. Marks, she's gone.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.381
MULLEN:
No. No!

01:53.414 --> 01:54.548
This can't be
happening.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.855
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Staff administrator
to nuclear medicine.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.726
Staff administrator to
nuclear medicine.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.905
Miss Ryan?
Yes.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.574
Hi, uh, I hope I'm
not bothering you.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.543
I don't... I don't have
your number and...

02:22.576 --> 02:23.711
What can I help you with?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.246
I've actually
been wanting

02:25.279 --> 02:26.714
to talk to you for
a really long time.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.583
I-I reached out to your
hus... your ex-husband,

02:29.617 --> 02:30.518
uh, Mr. Michaels.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.220
He gave me
this address.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.222
He said he was
gonna call you.
(cell phone rings)

02:34.255 --> 02:35.589
What is this about exactly?

02:35.623 --> 02:37.591
Oh, uh, maybe he forgot.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.962
Maybe this was
a bad idea.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.764
I have to take this call--
just be one second.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.433
Elijah?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.435
MUNDO: Hacker collective just
took over a Dallas hospital.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.436
There's one death.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.437
All right.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.438
We're downloading at CTOC.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.472
I'll be right up.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.279
Excuse me, Agent Ryan.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.514
The young woman you were just
with wanted me to give you this.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.217
Thank you.
Welcome.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.686
(beeps)

03:08.856 --> 03:10.491
Lindsey Mullen died
half an hour ago

03:10.524 --> 03:12.826
of cardiac arrest at City
Mercy Hospital in Dallas.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.362
Her drug pump
malfunctioned.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.463
I spoke with some
hospital techs.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.366
Nothing indicates that the
pump itself was faulty.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.467
So, it sounds like a hack.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.802
RUSSELL: So we think the hacker
collective Grey Ruin

03:21.835 --> 03:23.537
intruded into Lindsey
Mullen's drug pump

03:23.571 --> 03:26.874
and then forced it to administer
a lethal dose of morphine.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.809
We might be looking
for a bigger intrusion.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.344
The pump was controlled

03:30.378 --> 03:31.479
by a computer in the
hospital's network.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.814
And it's possible the targets
hacked the whole system.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.816
And they threaten to kill
again. In four hours.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.985
Despite what the hacker
says on the video,

03:38.018 --> 03:39.653
I don't think Grey Ruin
is responsible.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.821
It's just not their style.

03:40.854 --> 03:41.622
You're right.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.357
Grey Ruin is not
a collective known

03:43.391 --> 03:45.459
for publically claiming
responsibility.

03:45.493 --> 03:46.427
Or committing a murder.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.728
I mean, these guys don't
care about anything

03:47.761 --> 03:50.298
but showing off their skills.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.300
Well, remotely controlling
our victim's drug pump

03:52.333 --> 03:53.701
shows a lot of skill.

03:53.734 --> 03:54.768
Not as much as you'd think.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.371
Scary truth-- most medical
devices are less secure

03:57.405 --> 03:58.706
than your smartphone.
RYAN:
The bottom line is--

03:58.739 --> 04:01.642
someone found a way
to remotely kill a patient.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.712
This is looking like
technology-facilitated murder.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.846
We need to get
into that hospital,

04:05.879 --> 04:07.948
find all the devices
that are vulnerable.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.519
Elijah, Krumitz, you're staying
here, working from CTOC.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.553
Everyone else,
let's move.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.654
We got four hours

04:13.687 --> 04:15.956
till our hackers try
to kill again.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.791
Um, Avery.

04:17.825 --> 04:20.328
I'm trained to
be in the field.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.795
Elijah...
Um...

04:21.829 --> 04:23.797
you broke FBI protocol.

04:23.831 --> 04:27.301
I saw you beat a suspect
that was incapacitated.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.636
He was a pedophile.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.970
He lured those kids
to that house.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.640
I'm not excusing
his actions, Elijah.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.509
But you jeopardize
our entire case

04:35.543 --> 04:37.645
when you let your emotions
cloud your judgment.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.779
You need some time.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.614
You're staying here
in Washington.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.516
Let's go!

04:54.595 --> 04:57.030
MARKS: As chief of staff,
I've authorized rescheduling

04:57.064 --> 04:59.032
appointments
and routine surgeries.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.101
We've diverted ambulances
and incoming patients

05:01.134 --> 05:02.336
to other
local hospitals.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.873
Any patients that
are not in need

05:05.906 --> 05:06.974
of immediate
medical assistance

05:07.007 --> 05:09.477
should be moved out
of the hospital.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.479
Those that remain should be
relocated to a secure floor

05:11.512 --> 05:12.746
so we can focus on
protecting them.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.082
We can move them to the ICU.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.117
What exactly is happening here?

05:17.150 --> 05:19.753
Well, we believe that
the hackers injected malware

05:19.787 --> 05:21.355
into the hospital
computer system.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.823
And they may have control

05:22.856 --> 05:24.792
over all of your networked
medical devices.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.760
How many patients do
you have hooked up

05:26.794 --> 05:28.095
to devices on your system?

05:28.128 --> 05:29.730
Roughly 175.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.365
How fast can you
get them off-line?

05:31.399 --> 05:32.666
Uh...

05:32.700 --> 05:33.734
I don't know.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.803
Uh, there's federal regulations
I have to get by.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.905
FDA, OSHA, the ACA,
and the video has locked us

05:37.938 --> 05:39.840
out of our network.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.843
Dr. Marks, all patients on
infusion pumps are off-network.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.911
MARKS:
Thank you, Dr. Luca.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.746
Keep me updated
on the rest.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.115
The hospital board has agreed
to pay the ransom.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.451
I strongly advise
against that.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.819
Why?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.787
Grey Ruin just released
a new statement online,

05:53.821 --> 05:54.655
claiming this is
not their work.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.524
And we believe them.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.792
It is not their M.O. to kill
people and demand money.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.794
RUSSELL: No, it's more
likely it's somebody

06:00.828 --> 06:01.729
with a personal vendetta,

06:01.762 --> 06:02.796
somebody who's pretending
to be Grey Ruin.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.898
And we'll know that once
we analyze the drug pump.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.434
RYAN:
We need a list.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.835
Employees, patients,
anyone who could have

06:07.868 --> 06:09.603
a motive to hurt
the hospital.

06:09.637 --> 06:10.771
We've got two hours.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.673
Okay.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.111
All right, let's see.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.880
All right.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.348
Yeah, I'm not finding
any prints.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.851
So this must be a remote hack.
If our target left
any digital evidence,

06:23.884 --> 06:25.819
my program will find it.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.622
When drug pumps connect to the
hospital's network over Wi-Fi,

06:28.656 --> 06:29.757
allows the medical staff

06:29.790 --> 06:31.959
to remotely monitor
their patients.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.461
The pumps have
built-in safeguards

06:33.494 --> 06:34.595
that prevent lethal doses.

06:34.628 --> 06:37.197
Unfortunately, the hackers
removed these safeguards,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.666
which allowed them
to kill Lindsey Mullen.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.706
The scariest part is--

06:45.739 --> 06:48.208
the pump doesn't authenticate
who has access to it.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.477
So once the target was
in the hospital network,

06:49.510 --> 06:51.812
they could do whatever
they wanted to the drug pump.
Yep.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.781
Check this out.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.053
Oxygen 101, pulse 85.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.655
Right?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.791
No change.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.659
See?

07:05.693 --> 07:07.795
The target wrote code that
manipulated the display

07:07.828 --> 07:09.129
that showed Lindsey
Mullen's vitals.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.198
So the heart rate monitor
works over Wi-Fi as well.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.232
Yep.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.234
But the thing I don't get

07:14.267 --> 07:16.770
is if the target wanted
Lindsey dead,

07:16.804 --> 07:18.839
why would he mess
with her heart rate monitor?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.974
Because it takes at least
five minutes for morphine

07:21.008 --> 07:22.843
to cause cardiac arrest.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.545
Target needed
that time to kill her.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.147
Target hacked
her heart rate monitor,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.816
kept her heartbeat steady

07:28.849 --> 07:31.151
so that the medical staff
would not be alerted

07:31.184 --> 07:32.753
and come save her.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.022
Guaranteed her death.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.926
Have to irrigate
his wound, stat.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.962
Raven?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.965
Excuse me.
I can't get in this.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.073
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Critical care bypass status.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.175
All personnel, we are on
critical care bypass status.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.844
RAMIREZ:
D.B.

07:56.877 --> 07:57.845
Hey.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.013
D.B., I fixed
it for you.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.949
There you go.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.951
Thank you.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.955
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Sim to the ICU, stat.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.923
MULLEN: I heard some of
the nurses whispering.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.259
Someone did this
on purpose?

08:12.292 --> 08:15.929
My team and I are looking
into it, Mr. Mullen.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.798
We went rafting.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.932
Lindsey went overboard.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.968
Uh, she broke her leg.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.836
No surgery?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.505
No. It was a
minor injury.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.009
Why would someone
do this to her?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.545
We're still investigating
exactly what happened here.

08:31.579 --> 08:34.548
I-I know it's no
consolation to you,

08:34.582 --> 08:36.183
but Lindsey was not the target.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.591
I-I'm sorry.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.926
I wish that there was more
I could tell you right now.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.930
This doesn't seem real.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.667
You come to a hospital
to get better, not to die.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.772
We finally found enough nurses
to manually pump oxygen.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.874
We can take patients off
of network ventilators.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.976
Don't do it--
I found a kill switch

09:03.010 --> 09:04.645
hidden in the source code
of the ventilators.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.881
If you take the ventilator
patients off of the network,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.883
it'll send a shockwave
to all the medical devices

09:09.917 --> 09:12.920
and power to the entire
hospital will be cut.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.588
Including the
backup generators.

09:14.622 --> 09:16.924
That will kill any patient

09:16.957 --> 09:18.592
relying on a ventilator
to breathe for them.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.061
Uh, manually pumping oxygen
won't matter.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.930
How many ventilator patients
do you have on the network?

09:22.963 --> 09:24.632
Nine, most of them in comas.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.601
Call CTOC, have Krumitz start
working on a patch.

09:27.635 --> 09:28.969
We've got another problem.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.171
The computer virus spread
outside the hospital.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.273
(machine beeping)

09:33.306 --> 09:35.008
(flatline tones)
She's dead.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.712
Never seen the defibrillator
do this before.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.147
Something's wrong.

09:45.318 --> 09:51.659
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

09:53.360 --> 09:59.900
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

09:59.933 --> 10:03.036
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:03.070 --> 10:07.107
* I can see for miles
and miles *

10:07.140 --> 10:11.178
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:11.211 --> 10:14.948
* And miles...

10:14.982 --> 10:15.983
* Oh, yeah.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
(indistinct radio transmission)
WOMAN: Who's got the entry list?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.166
RAMIREZ: Yeah, the malware
is sophisticated.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.068
It spreads over Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.170
I-I don't understand.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.172
Your defibrillator
has Bluetooth technology,

10:39.206 --> 10:41.742
allowing it to communicate
with the hospital's computers,

10:41.775 --> 10:43.010
so the medical staff
can quickly access

10:43.043 --> 10:44.177
your patient's heart rate data.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.412
RUSSELL: When you entered
the hospital,

10:45.445 --> 10:49.382
the malware leaped onto your
defib from an infected device.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.952
I uploaded a patient's vitals
to the nurse's station.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.186
Yes, I-I'll show you.
Right over here.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.722
Oh, great.
Thank you.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.690
We're gonna need to call
radiology and have them send

10:56.724 --> 10:58.225
the scans right over
to the maternity ward...

10:58.258 --> 11:00.861
RAMIREZ: You're gonna need
to get a new defibrillator.

11:00.894 --> 11:01.995
Not from this hospital.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.898
Were you able to get
on the network?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.900
Yeah. The video was
easy to penetrate,

11:06.934 --> 11:08.401
But even though
I'm in the network,

11:08.435 --> 11:09.903
I can't access the devices

11:09.937 --> 11:11.471
in the hospital.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.106
And we can't take
the network offline, right?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.275
Because of the kill switch
in the ventilator.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.377
This is the hospital's network,

11:17.410 --> 11:19.780
and you see
all the grayed-out areas.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.281
The malware shut down access
to those departments.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.450
Everything is blocked off.

11:23.483 --> 11:24.885
I can't get into anything.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.887
Well, our target
owns this hospital.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.422
I found a timestamp of
the first sign of malware.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.059
Our target injected this malware
five months ago.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.727
Hospital systems
are complicated.

11:33.761 --> 11:34.795
Probably took the target
that long

11:34.828 --> 11:36.797
just to learn the system.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.998
Can we quarantine
the malware?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.000
I can write a script that will
scrub it off the network.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.002
But it's gonna take time.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.270
We don't have time.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.104
We've got just over
an hour and a half

11:44.137 --> 11:46.473
before our target
tries to kill again.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.441
RUSSELL: Find out where
Krumitz is on the kill switch.

11:48.475 --> 11:49.910
No. I'm in.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.444
I'm in, they're dead!

11:51.478 --> 11:53.180
Okay, what do you got?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.449
Cracked your code
in three seconds, man.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.450
Come on. Seriously.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.820
Hey.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.091
Okay, better.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.492
But no.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.360
Nine patients!

12:07.394 --> 12:08.996
That's how many people we have

12:09.029 --> 12:10.430
on networked ventilators
right now,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.265
and they're all dead

12:12.299 --> 12:14.501
because your patches cannot stop
the target's kill switch.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.337
Our target is smart,
but we are smarter,

12:17.370 --> 12:20.107
and we've got 87 minutes
for brilliance.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.208
Come on, guys!

12:21.241 --> 12:22.810
Let's see it!

12:25.212 --> 12:26.780
We getting anywhere
with the suspects?

12:26.814 --> 12:28.281
It's... a lot
of upset nurses

12:28.315 --> 12:30.383
who lost their jobs to computers
who can do the work for them.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.518
Motive 101.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.386
Great.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.058
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:38.091 --> 12:40.861
(indistinct conversations)

12:40.894 --> 12:42.262
RUSSELL:
Jules?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.031
FINLAY: There's only one person
in the world

12:44.064 --> 12:46.099
who would dare
to call me Jules.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.870
Nobody calls me
Diebenkorn around here.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.971
It's "D.B."

12:56.009 --> 12:57.010
Russell?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.415
You okay?
Yes.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.416
Sorry.

13:03.450 --> 13:03.984
What did Elijah find?

13:04.017 --> 13:05.118
He compiled a list of

13:05.152 --> 13:06.519
20 possible
suspects.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.521
He's looking for
criminal activity,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.357
records of threats...
Hopefully we'll get a lead.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.860
We're running out of time,
Avery.

13:12.893 --> 13:15.262
We need to find another way.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.997
(mumbling)

13:17.030 --> 13:18.331
Come on.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.333
MAN (over P.A.):
Surgery, pick up line 12.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.835
(mumbling)

13:21.869 --> 13:23.203
Ah!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.105
Got it.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.376
Lounge.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.511
Ah!

13:34.214 --> 13:35.215
Whoo!

13:41.889 --> 13:43.256
Ooh, snap! Thomas Knight?

13:43.290 --> 13:44.257
Thee T-K.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.492
Boy, you're
supposed to be

13:45.525 --> 13:46.626
like the next LeBron.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.428
I'm gonna be better than LeBron.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.562
All right, I hear you.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.331
All right. What, you doing
a little physical therapy

13:51.364 --> 13:52.332
after knee surgery?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.934
Finally getting out today.

13:53.967 --> 13:54.902
What you doing to that TV?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.436
It's for an FBI investigation,
that's all.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.005
You're an FBI agent?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.273
Yep. Kind of, yeah.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.441
All right, bro, do your thing.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.442
All right.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.877
RUSSELL:
Uh, sorry.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.412
Hey, was that...?

14:05.445 --> 14:06.313
T-K? Yep.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.115
This TV is the origin

14:08.148 --> 14:09.950
of the malware?
NELSON:
Yeah, this is it.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.284
RUSSELL:
Wi-Fi enabled,

14:11.318 --> 14:14.121
built-in apps, games,
video streaming services.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.355
It's a smart TV.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.925
NELSON:
Connects to the same network
as the medical devices.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.427
The target used it to infect
the entire hospital.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.329
Tons of people have
access to this room.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.198
Doctors, nurses,
patients, visitors.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.234
That's a lot
of potential suspects.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.969
Maybe we can narrow it down.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.271
Raven found a timestamp
from when the malware

14:31.304 --> 14:32.605
first infected
the system.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.974
It was five months ago.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.308
And we have
an eyewitness.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.584
I narrowed the list of people

14:44.617 --> 14:46.286
who had the motive
to harm City Mercy

14:46.319 --> 14:47.454
and the means to pull this off.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.388
Down to one guy?
Mm-hmm.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.423
Who's Artie Sneed?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.525
MUNDO:
He's a security researcher
from Baltimore.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.027
Now, he was arrested
last April

14:54.061 --> 14:55.295
for hacking a medical
device supplier

14:55.328 --> 14:57.064
that sells to all
major hospitals.

14:57.097 --> 14:57.998
Did he work at City Mercy?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.366
Nope. Never even been there.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.368
And you believe this guy
is behind this because...?

15:01.401 --> 15:04.404
He's been calling hospitals all
across the country, warning them

15:04.437 --> 15:06.373
that the medical devices
have vulnerabilities.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
Now, last year, he called
City Mercy eight times,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.543
but the hospital just
dismissed him as a whacko.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.245
Well, he probably is.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.014
Who makes that face
in their driver's license photo?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.048
Where are
you going?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.316
Baltimore.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.484
I thought Avery grounded you.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.319
She told me to stay
in Washington.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.453
Everybody knows
Baltimore's

15:20.487 --> 15:22.522
just a suburb of the District.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.426
Okay, here we go.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.395
Let's hope
my quarantine program works.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.503
Not working.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.338
Okay, give it time.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.079
WOMAN:
It's gone!

15:46.113 --> 15:47.680
WOMAN 2:
Looks like they're
coming back up.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.382
Intake system is online.
Over here, too!

15:49.416 --> 15:52.019
EMR's back up!
I'm in.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.386
MAN:
We're up over here, too.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.487
(alarm sounding)

15:54.521 --> 15:55.488
Print this
while you can!

15:55.522 --> 15:57.024
The lab results...

15:57.057 --> 15:59.092
(overlapping chatter)

16:00.360 --> 16:02.495
(overlapping chatter)

16:02.529 --> 16:03.997
What's happening?

16:04.031 --> 16:05.165
RAMIREZ:
Okay, strange commands

16:05.198 --> 16:06.166
are being sent
to the computer

16:06.199 --> 16:07.267
in the MRI room.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.143
RYAN:
Which one of these computers
controls the MRI?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.477
I've never seen it
do this before.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.645
I can't stop it!

16:21.314 --> 16:23.283
MARKS:
I think they
reversed the polarity

16:23.316 --> 16:24.384
of the magnet.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.421
You okay?

16:28.455 --> 16:29.456
Yeah, are you?

16:39.732 --> 16:40.700
The MRI went crazy.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.702
The target shut down
the superconducting coils

16:42.735 --> 16:45.438
and turned it into
a magnetic weapon.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.806
I thought your program
was supposed to wipe

16:46.839 --> 16:48.508
the malware from the system.
It was.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.543
The target must have a back
door somehow that we missed.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.112
Where are you with
the ventilators?

16:52.145 --> 16:55.415
In my ten years at the FBI,
I have only failed once.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.517
Today might be the second time.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.552
This kill switch
is impossible to crack.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.521
There's no digital evidence
on the MRI, either.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.522
I don't get it.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.391
All right.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.458
What are they doing?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.593
The emergency lights,

17:06.626 --> 17:08.528
the MRI, the message.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.563
It's all very dramatic.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.598
This target has an ego.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.600
They want us to know
they are still in control.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.235
Right. So we kick them
out of the network,

17:15.268 --> 17:16.836
they respond with the MRI hack.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.638
But why? What-what do they want?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.407
I don't think
they're after money.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.675
I believe this target
wants to create

17:22.709 --> 17:24.711
panic and chaos.
That is their main goal.
(phone beeps)

17:24.744 --> 17:27.480
Surveillance footage was a bust.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.216
They dump it
every four months.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.383
Raven!

17:30.417 --> 17:32.585
Got anything?

17:32.619 --> 17:33.553
Okay.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.555
Nelson's smart TV.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.723
That is our best bet.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.558
It is the origin
of intrusion.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.360
Our patient zero.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.661
Okay, I'll check in with him.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.330
We have less than an hour left

17:43.363 --> 17:44.431
before the next attack.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.535
*

18:06.353 --> 18:07.320
NELSON:
It's a modchip.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.721
This is a hardware hack?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.657
Yep. These chips override
the system's software.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.792
Makes the device do
whatever the hacker wants.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.595
Which, in this case, is to push
the malware to the entire

18:15.628 --> 18:16.596
hospital network.

18:16.629 --> 18:17.597
I get that.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.898
But what about
the smart TV?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.401
It has its own hard drive,
so why didn't the target

18:21.434 --> 18:23.570
just load his malware
directly onto that?

18:23.603 --> 18:24.571
Why a modchip?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.473
Cloaking.
Made it invisible

18:26.506 --> 18:27.574
to my initial
scan of the TV.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.808
If I didn't take
that TV apart,

18:28.841 --> 18:30.143
we would have missed it.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.478
Can we trace the chip?
No.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.813
What about the TV itself?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.182
Well, City Mercy bought 180 TVs

18:35.215 --> 18:36.349
for the whole hospital
about a year ago.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.417
I tracked down
the purchase order

18:37.450 --> 18:38.551
and ran the
serial numbers.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.453
This TV was not on
the purchase order.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.521
So five months ago,

18:41.554 --> 18:43.790
our target brought in this
TV and swapped it out.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.858
Another dead end.
No, wait.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.228
Maybe not. We can run
this TV's serial number

18:48.261 --> 18:49.662
against consumer
sales records, right?

18:49.696 --> 18:52.299
Because the manufacturers
keep track

18:52.332 --> 18:54.867
of which retailers
buy their units, right?
Right.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.836
Maybe this can lead to a name.
All right.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.347
(dog barking)

19:07.380 --> 19:10.483
MAN:
Rocky! Shut up, Rocky!

19:12.585 --> 19:15.688
...cell phones, cars,
the atomic bomb, cloning.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.757
Andrew, think about it.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.726
Why didn't we have
this kind of technology

19:19.759 --> 19:21.294
during the Revolutionary War?
No, Andrew, no!

19:21.328 --> 19:24.664
No. The government can deny
the truth all they want,

19:24.697 --> 19:26.633
but alien intervention
is the only explanation...

19:26.666 --> 19:27.934
for...

19:27.967 --> 19:29.336
Artie Sneed.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.604
Agent Mundo
of the FBI.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.740
It's time we had a chat
about City Mercy.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.277
I would never hurt anyone,
Agent Mundo.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.312
You have to believe me.
Why should I?

19:39.346 --> 19:40.680
You were arrested for hacking

19:40.713 --> 19:41.514
a medical device supplier.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.515
SNEED:
That was a misunderstanding.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.917
All I did was swap some programs
with Schmitty.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.319
He's the one
that hacked the supplier.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.320
I just got caught with the code.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.721
Schmitty?
This guy I met

19:48.755 --> 19:50.490
on a Deep Web
medical message board.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.625
Turns out, not everyone
on the wire is trustworthy.

19:52.659 --> 19:53.760
I mean, Schmitty, oh...

19:53.793 --> 19:54.761
he's a bad dude.

19:54.794 --> 19:55.828
Wrote a ton of code

19:55.862 --> 19:57.564
on how to hack infusion pumps.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.332
Made money selling it online
to script kiddies.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.700
What, so you think Schmitty

20:00.733 --> 20:02.302
might be the one
behind this hack?

20:02.335 --> 20:03.470
No, not possible.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.737
He's rotting in jail
as we speak.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.906
But he probably sold his code
to your hacker.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.611
What are you doing
with my devices?

20:11.644 --> 20:13.480
MUNDO:
Confirming that you've
never been to Texas

20:13.513 --> 20:15.315
and you had nothing to do
with the City Mercy hack.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.317
So you believe me?
The Cellebrite doesn't lie.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.485
So yeah, Artie, I believe you.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.786
(exhales)

20:19.819 --> 20:21.020
Oh, good.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.756
All I want to do is help people.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.692
No one should have to end up

20:25.725 --> 20:28.561
like my poor Charlene did.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.530
Charlene, she...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.532
she was my wife

20:32.565 --> 20:35.502
and she died two years ago
at a hospital.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.969
Doctors couldn't explain
what happened.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.406
(sighs)

20:39.439 --> 20:41.040
And I've been trying
to figure out,

20:41.073 --> 20:44.243
every day since, what it was.

20:45.712 --> 20:46.746
I'm sorry.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.548
Thanks.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.052
MUNDO:
Wait a minute.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.654
You coded patches
for the medical devices?

20:54.687 --> 20:55.988
I'm gonna need

20:56.022 --> 20:57.657
every single computer
that contains that code.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.658
Oh, of course.

20:58.691 --> 20:59.592
But each subroutine is divided

20:59.626 --> 21:01.828
into separate depositories
for pen testing.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.563
It's a little jumbled.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.731
You have to make sure
that your techs

21:04.764 --> 21:05.898
understand that and know that

21:05.932 --> 21:07.734
before they try
to assemble the code.
Are you saying

21:07.767 --> 21:08.768
you're the only person who knows
how to piece it together?

21:08.801 --> 21:11.804
Well, that's not necessarily
what I'm saying...

21:11.838 --> 21:13.039
Artie, pack your patches.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.442
You're gonna help us
finish it back in D.C.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.043
At the FBI?
The government?

21:17.076 --> 21:18.711
Yep.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.313
Let me put some clothes on.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.748
Uh, you know, Agent Mundo,
I got some more laptops

21:21.781 --> 21:23.716
in the back bedroom there.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.753
(door closes)

21:30.857 --> 21:32.525
Listen... (panting)

21:32.559 --> 21:33.726
they're not gonna get us,
Rocky.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.927
I won't let them get us.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.329
Don't worry, Rocky.

21:36.363 --> 21:38.565
We're not gonna
let them get us.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.700
I won't let them get us.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.068
Why are you running?

21:42.101 --> 21:43.503
You're not under arrest.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.605
You have a very honest
face, Agent Mundo.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.973
Nice, clean cut.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.108
I just don't trust
the government!

21:49.141 --> 21:51.010
Get in the car, Artie.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.680
No! No, thank you!

21:55.848 --> 21:57.684
(tires screech)
Hey!

21:57.717 --> 21:59.686
Stay away from me!

21:59.719 --> 22:00.853
Get him, Rocky.

22:02.389 --> 22:05.024
How are you doing
on those ventilators?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.793
I'm trying.
My patch isn't working.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.361
Krummy can't crack it, either!

22:08.395 --> 22:10.997
Yeah, and no hits on
the TV serial number.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.399
The hospital's board just

22:12.432 --> 22:13.866
tried to pay,
but the transfer was rejected.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.502
The routing number was
for an off-shore account

22:15.535 --> 22:16.803
that didn't exist.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.705
That's because this was
never about the money.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.940
Our target could do
this in any hospital

22:20.973 --> 22:22.775
across the country--
why this one?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.844
This is personal.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.780
Look, we've got 13 minutes left.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.649
I'm open to
an out-of-the-box solution.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.917
Someone, anyone!

22:30.950 --> 22:32.785
(indistinct chatter)

22:32.819 --> 22:35.087
Did I die? (chuckles)
(beeps)

22:35.121 --> 22:36.623
Is this heaven?

22:36.656 --> 22:37.757
(laughs)

22:37.790 --> 22:40.760
Oh, man, I can't wait
to put this in Andrew's face!

22:40.793 --> 22:42.829
He's always bragging to me
about that Millennium Falcon

22:42.862 --> 22:44.931
cockpit he built
in his mom's house.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.433
Ooh, hey!

22:46.466 --> 22:48.000
Can I take a selfie
for my Instagram?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.636
Artie, no, come on.
Let's go.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.772
Man, if anybody'd ever told me
that this is where

22:52.805 --> 22:55.608
my tax dollars are going,
I'd actually start...

22:55.642 --> 22:56.776
Never mind.

22:56.809 --> 22:57.810
Elijah, what's...

22:57.844 --> 22:59.145
Driver's License
Guy doing up here?

22:59.178 --> 23:01.414
Uh, long story.
He's here to help.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.782
Hey, I'm Artie Sneed.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.817
I heard you needed some
help with the ventilators.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.419
Uh...
Let's go.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.688
The ventilators-- very,
very, very tricky business.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.790
You cannot patch them directly-
no, no, no, no, no.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.559
You have to respect
the kill switch.

23:12.592 --> 23:13.560
Always respect the kill switch!

23:13.593 --> 23:14.794
Artie, Artie, focus!

23:14.827 --> 23:15.995
We don't have a lot
of time left, come on!

23:16.028 --> 23:18.698
Right, yes, uh, okay, let me
see, where was I? Yes, uh...

23:18.731 --> 23:21.934
Right, direct ventilator patches
are off the table.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.803
But we can protect
how they connect to...

23:23.836 --> 23:25.905
The network itself!
Yes!

23:25.938 --> 23:27.640
That's genius!

23:27.674 --> 23:28.975
I'm thinking about it all wrong.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.443
It's just like
blocking a bridge.

23:30.477 --> 23:31.844
You stop, then divert traffic.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.946
Exactly!

23:33.980 --> 23:35.014
Code's good, Artie.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.483
Needs a little loving here

23:36.516 --> 23:37.784
and some tweaking there.

23:37.817 --> 23:40.219
I'm gonna adjust
this subroutine and...

23:40.252 --> 23:43.089
bam!

23:43.122 --> 23:45.091
(laughs)
Did it work?

23:45.124 --> 23:46.626
I can't believe it.
Yes, it worked! It worked!

23:46.659 --> 23:47.226
Yes.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.628
High five, my man!

23:48.661 --> 23:49.629
Yes.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.898
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:54.967 --> 23:57.604
Krumitz just sent us the patch!

23:57.637 --> 23:59.005
It's installing.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.040
The patch should block
our hacker's access.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.114
RAMIREZ:
Uh, wait a minute, Nelson.

24:08.147 --> 24:11.183
Looks like the hacker's trying
to get ahead of the patch.

24:11.217 --> 24:14.053
RUSSELL: They're still trying
to go for the ventilators.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.889
Not on my watch.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.891
Slow them down
until the install's complete.

24:22.094 --> 24:25.031
Look, if we can't
stop the hack,

24:25.064 --> 24:26.999
can you manually vent
all of the patients?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.167
Yeah, just a second.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.869
Ambu bags and oxygen tanks
are at every patient's bed.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.671
And you have
the nurses to do that?

24:31.704 --> 24:32.672
Yes!

24:32.705 --> 24:34.140
It's going to work, D.B.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.209
Ah, install's complete.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.878
Krummy's patch is working.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.913
We stopped the target's
ventilator attack.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.917
The status of the patients
on ventilators?

24:45.918 --> 24:47.920
Safe.

24:47.954 --> 24:48.855
The rest of the hospital?

24:48.888 --> 24:51.023
All the patients are alive
and accounted for.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.058
Deadline's passed.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.693
(grunts)

24:53.726 --> 24:55.895
Okay, good work, guys,
but listen.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.131
Our target still has remote
access to this network.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.867
So let's find them,

25:00.900 --> 25:03.035
root them out
and let's make an arrest.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.973
NELSON:
Krummy, I'm not detecting

25:07.006 --> 25:08.808
any rogue device.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.109
They have to be hiding
somewhere in the network.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.978
Are you sure you've
checked every router?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.279
Look, there's
nothing here, Krumitz.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.648
It's like they
weren't even here.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.983
Come on, beautiful,
do we really have

25:17.016 --> 25:18.317
to do the whole
wheelchair routine?

25:18.350 --> 25:20.086
Sorry, hospital policy.
Checking out, TK?

25:20.119 --> 25:22.789
Two minutes away from freedom.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.891
All right, better
kick some ass this year.

25:24.924 --> 25:25.958
You know it.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.994
(indistinct chatter)

25:35.668 --> 25:37.604
Memories of Julie Finlay?

25:37.637 --> 25:41.007
Clearly, you were
a very good therapist.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.042
And even better listener.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.613
I know you and Julie
were very close.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.051
She was my best friend.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.654
I spent months in a room
just like this one,

25:54.687 --> 25:57.223
hoping she'd wake up

25:57.256 --> 25:58.891
and make some snide comment

25:58.925 --> 26:00.893
about my predictable choice
in reading material.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.129
She didn't share your
love of literature?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.296
No.

26:04.330 --> 26:07.299
Right before she was attacked,

26:07.333 --> 26:10.036
I-I lent her a copy
of The Thin Man,

26:10.069 --> 26:11.370
my favorite crime novel.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.674
She was the Nora
to your Nick.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.109
Mm-hmm.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.978
I read it to her every weekend.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.648
And I had this
romantic notion

26:21.681 --> 26:23.249
that when I read
that final sentence,

26:23.282 --> 26:25.051
her eyes would open.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.955
But she died
before I finished it.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.790
(rapid beeping)

26:32.859 --> 26:35.094
Hey! Hey, she's crashing!

26:35.127 --> 26:36.162
Doctor...
NURSE: Watch out.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.263
Back up.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.698
We protected the ventilators.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.267
How's this happening?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.169
The target isn't
in the network.

26:43.202 --> 26:44.637
I don't, I don't
know what's going on.

26:47.674 --> 26:48.741
Doctor?

26:48.775 --> 26:50.810
It was her heart.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.912
She went critical,
but she's stabilizing now.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.114
So, it had nothing to do
with the ventilator?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.015
No.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.117
NURSE:
I got a code blue!

26:58.150 --> 27:00.219
Code blue outside!

27:00.252 --> 27:03.155
Come on!
Come on!

27:03.189 --> 27:04.991
Breathe!
What happened?

27:05.024 --> 27:07.827
Don't know, he just collapsed
after I wheeled him out here.

27:07.860 --> 27:08.861
RUSSELL:
TK?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.915
TK was perfectly healthy.
RYAN: Nelson?

27:28.948 --> 27:30.649
He wasn't even
hooked up to anything.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.451
This is murder, Avery.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.387
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:37.323 --> 27:39.158
Tell them.
Uh, I had just started

27:39.191 --> 27:40.359
a new shift and
I saw Thomas'

27:40.392 --> 27:41.928
medication schedule
on my tablet.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.062
It said it was
time to give him

27:43.095 --> 27:43.930
his anti-inflammatory meds.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.431
It was his normal
routine, so I did.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.966
Dorvatrin.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.868
It's non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory injection

27:48.901 --> 27:50.202
used to treat pain.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.871
But according to Thomas'
paper medical record,

27:51.904 --> 27:53.372
he was allergic to Dorvatrin.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.008
All right, so,

27:56.042 --> 27:57.944
Thomas is allergic
to Dorvatrin.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.279
Someone altered his
electronic medical record,

28:00.312 --> 28:03.315
prescribed him a medication
he never should've been on.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.451
We stopped the
ventilator attack.

28:05.484 --> 28:07.086
This is their counter.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.221
Found a new way to keep
to their deadline.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.258
MAN: You tried to pay, but money
does not solve your problems.

28:12.291 --> 28:15.027
You are accountable
for what you have done.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.764
In one hour,
we will kill again.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.366
If we can't pay them off,
how do we stop them?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.334
"You're accountable
for what you've done."

28:22.368 --> 28:25.004
Our target wants revenge.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.206
Look, they knew what time
the nurse's shift would change,

28:27.239 --> 28:29.475
when they could alter
Thomas' medical record.

28:29.508 --> 28:30.843
And you would need
pharmaceutical

28:30.877 --> 28:32.511
knowledge to know
that Dorvatrin

28:32.544 --> 28:34.981
would send Thomas
into anaphylactic shock, right?

28:35.014 --> 28:37.483
So, our target
is a nurse or a doctor?

28:37.516 --> 28:39.318
Makes sense and how come
they're two steps

28:39.351 --> 28:40.887
ahead of us every time
we make a move?

28:40.920 --> 28:44.824
Because they're here
in the hospital right now.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.893
Lock it down!
No one goes in or out!

28:46.926 --> 28:48.460
WOMAN: Lock it down!
MAN: Lock it down!

28:48.494 --> 28:50.763
MAN 2:
Locking it down. Let's go.
(men shouting)

28:50.797 --> 28:52.531
The target couldn't have
altered Thomas' medical record

28:52.564 --> 28:55.234
without leaving
some type of digital trace.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.769
We were so busy
looking for the target's

28:56.803 --> 28:57.904
next attack on the network,

28:57.937 --> 29:00.006
we didn't even consider
a simpler way to commit murder.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.774
KRUMITZ: The target didn't even
need to use the ventilators

29:01.808 --> 29:03.075
to kill;
all he had to do

29:03.109 --> 29:04.911
was digitally prescribe
the wrong drug.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.846
And there's no dust
in the nurse's computer!

29:06.879 --> 29:08.514
I have no idea how the hacker

29:08.547 --> 29:10.950
altered Thomas'
electronic medical chart.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.485
The pharmacy.

29:13.519 --> 29:14.486
Who is that?!

29:14.520 --> 29:16.255
Who's who?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.257
The guy whispering
sweet nothings in your ear.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.492
Artie Sneed.
It's a pleasure. Uh, look,

29:20.526 --> 29:23.329
doctors prescribe meds directly
through a patient's EMR,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.531
then it routes through
the hospital pharmacy.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.867
The hacker probably
changed it there.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.569
Hey, do you guys ever use this
big screen for movie night?

29:30.602 --> 29:31.838
Like, pay-per-view boxing?

29:31.871 --> 29:33.105
I know how to get it
for nothing.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.841
Okay, Krummy, who is he?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.142
Ask Elijah!

29:36.175 --> 29:38.811
Listen, what matters is that he
knows what he's talking about.

29:38.845 --> 29:39.946
He helped write
the ventilator patch.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.381
All right,
checking the pharmacy now.

29:46.853 --> 29:47.820
There it is!

29:47.854 --> 29:49.355
The command that changed
Thomas' medical record

29:49.388 --> 29:51.290
came from a local router port!

29:51.323 --> 29:51.991
They didn't scrub the last hack?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.325
They weren't in the system long.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.861
Must've been moving so fast

29:54.894 --> 29:55.394
they made a mistake!

29:55.427 --> 29:56.996
Wait.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.166
The device is inside
the hospital!

30:00.199 --> 30:02.301
Guys, I'm tracing it now!

30:02.334 --> 30:03.870
Excuse me!

30:12.945 --> 30:14.947
Let's see.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.419
Avery, whoever's doing this

30:20.452 --> 30:22.855
is in the lower level
of the hospital.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.556
Go! Go! Go!

30:24.590 --> 30:26.859
(overlapping chatter)

30:26.893 --> 30:28.627
MAN: Come on, guys!
Move! Move! Move!

30:28.660 --> 30:29.929
On my signal!

30:31.563 --> 30:32.999
MAN:
Door's clear.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.034
FBI!
FBI!
FBI!

30:35.067 --> 30:37.904
(gasps)

30:37.937 --> 30:39.939
Teresa!

30:39.972 --> 30:42.174
I heard a crash,
I came to check it out.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.943
Nurse was smashing
the computer.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.611
She attacked me.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.379
Ran.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.347
Did you see her face?

30:48.380 --> 30:49.615
No!
(groans)

30:49.648 --> 30:51.951
She had red hair...

30:51.984 --> 30:53.252
Teresa? Teresa?

30:53.285 --> 30:54.921
She couldn't have gotten far.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.055
Okay, move out!

30:56.088 --> 30:57.289
We need to get her to surgery
before she bleeds out.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.132
Copy that.
Sublevel's clear.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.366
No sign of her.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.634
They're moving onto
the upper floors.

31:08.667 --> 31:09.535
Thanks.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.137
I just rounded up
all the nurses on duty.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.404
No redheads.
She's gonna be okay.

31:12.438 --> 31:14.206
Her wounds didn't
puncture any vital organs.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.975
What was she doing down here?

31:16.008 --> 31:18.177
Dr. Luca works
in radiology across the hall.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.212
We have 25 minutes.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.247
Do you guys have anything?

31:21.280 --> 31:22.614
Hard drive's
covered in bleach.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.384
Cleaning in the solution will
take at least that long.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.019
They we have to hope
it's not corroded.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.989
There has to be
something you can do.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.335
RUSSELL: So when...
when humans breathe,

31:43.369 --> 31:47.006
they inhale dust and pollen
and other airborne microbes

31:47.039 --> 31:48.174
from the environment, right?

31:48.207 --> 31:50.176
So where they have
been determines

31:50.209 --> 31:51.543
what's in their lungs.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.180
That TV is like
a living organism.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.215
It needs to breathe
to function,

31:56.248 --> 31:59.318
so it has this fan that keeps
the unit from overheating

31:59.351 --> 32:01.653
by sucking in cooling air.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.356
And then whatever particles
are flying around

32:04.390 --> 32:06.058
get sucked in, too.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.627
And they, uh, stick
to the fan blades.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.031
Oh, there you are.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.565
Okay, all right.

32:13.599 --> 32:18.004
So... so after we sequence
the DNA from this specimen,

32:18.037 --> 32:21.240
we can run it through the
index of airborne microbes--

32:21.273 --> 32:24.710
it's a nationwide database
of where bacteria resides.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.246
Our target dropped of that TV.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.448
It's possible that the fan
collected airborne microbes

32:29.481 --> 32:31.183
from where it lived
five months ago?

32:31.217 --> 32:32.484
Exactly.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.620
Cool, huh?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.322
(chuckles)

32:36.355 --> 32:38.324
By using the
bacteria database,

32:38.357 --> 32:40.459
we can zero in
on the TV's previous home

32:40.492 --> 32:43.162
to an area
within a ten-mile radius.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.230
Then we can cross-reference

32:44.263 --> 32:46.398
with addresses of all
the hospital's employees.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.499
(chuckling):
Yeah.

32:47.533 --> 32:48.500
(Russell mumbles)

32:48.534 --> 32:50.502
What do we got here?

32:50.536 --> 32:52.738
Bacterium--
Staphylococcus equorum.

32:52.771 --> 32:53.939
Claviceps pusilla.

32:53.972 --> 32:57.476
Okay, I'll plug these into
the index of airborne microbes

32:57.509 --> 32:59.578
and send the results to CTOC.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.416
MUNDO: Can't believe D.B.'s
fan thing actually worked.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.453
I'll get on
these addresses.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.428
RYAN:
Come on.

33:16.462 --> 33:17.629
Where are we at, guys?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.099
Well, the search
is only half done,

33:20.132 --> 33:22.434
but we're not finding
any employees in this area.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.303
It's possible this is gonna
take us back to the Best Buy

33:24.336 --> 33:26.405
it was purchased at
and not the actual...
MUNDO: Got it.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.739
We've got an address.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.176
Say hello
to our target.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.580
I'm just glad that you're okay.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.448
Did they find her,
the nurse?

33:36.482 --> 33:37.549
No.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.451
I'm taking you over to the
ICU until this is over.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.452
It's safer there.

33:40.486 --> 33:42.121
RYAN:
It was all a charade.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.489
What are you doing?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.425
"Doctor to the rescue,"
and you played that well.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.394
What the hell
are you talking about?

33:48.427 --> 33:51.197
After you released
the fake Grey Ruin video,

33:51.230 --> 33:53.299
you helped Colleen
while Lindsey Mullen died.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.033
(flatline tones)

34:00.372 --> 34:04.243
You're accusing me?

34:05.511 --> 34:07.379
I had nothing to do with this.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.116
You knew we were on to you when
we stopped your ventilator hack,

34:10.149 --> 34:12.118
so you changed your plan.

34:12.151 --> 34:16.322
You killed Thomas by altering
his electronic medical record.

34:16.355 --> 34:19.091
And then you tried
desperately to save him.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.126
Come on!

34:20.159 --> 34:21.727
Come on! Breathe!

34:21.760 --> 34:23.862
The EMR hack,
that was creative.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.532
You improvised that on the fly.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.600
But that's where you
made your mistake,

34:28.634 --> 34:30.469
because moving quickly,

34:30.502 --> 34:32.404
you forgot to anonymize
your computer,

34:32.438 --> 34:34.440
which led us to you.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.711
MAN:
Go, go, go!

34:39.745 --> 34:41.447
Be ready,
target may be armed.
Move, move, move!

34:46.752 --> 34:48.120
Come on, guys!

34:48.154 --> 34:50.156
Move, move, move!

34:50.189 --> 34:51.557
On my signal.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.626
(cries out, grunting)

34:57.163 --> 35:00.399
Only a doctor can stab
themselves six times

35:00.432 --> 35:02.268
and not have it
be life-threatening.

35:02.301 --> 35:05.471
You have nothing on me.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.506
Are you sure about that, Doctor?

35:07.539 --> 35:10.376
Because we traced
the infected modchip

35:10.409 --> 35:13.545
that you installed in the
TV room to your home address.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.915
Then we found proof on your
laptop that five months ago,

35:16.948 --> 35:20.919
you purchased the exact malware
used to hack City Mercy.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.922
Lindsey Mullen.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.192
Thomas Knight.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.194
You killed innocent
people today.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.395
Why?

35:35.434 --> 35:39.905
23 years of my life have
been spent saving people.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.876
People who had only
hours to live.

35:44.910 --> 35:49.448
People who had been told
to say their final good-byes.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.420
God had marked them for death,

35:54.453 --> 35:58.424
and I kept them on this earth.

35:58.457 --> 36:01.227
Me, no one else.

36:01.260 --> 36:04.563
And City Mercy
got famous,

36:04.596 --> 36:07.233
made a name
on my accomplishments,

36:07.266 --> 36:08.767
and what did I get?

36:08.800 --> 36:13.305
What did I get in return
for my sacrifice?

36:13.339 --> 36:16.675
They handed the hospital
that I had resurrected

36:16.708 --> 36:18.710
to her.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.794
RUSSELL: "'Just as you and I
will go on being us,

36:35.827 --> 36:38.464

"except the murdered's and

36:44.503 --> 36:46.805
"'That may be,' Nora said.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.541
'But it's all pretty

37:01.920 --> 37:03.889
MAN (over P.A.):

37:03.922 --> 37:05.557
Dr. Sim

37:05.591 --> 37:07.626
So many people love you--

37:07.659 --> 37:10.629
your-your family, your friends,

37:10.662 --> 37:12.664
you know, people who...

37:15.501 --> 37:18.304
...people who feel an emptiness
in their lives without you.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.739
You know, so just...

37:20.772 --> 37:23.809
remember them.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.844
And don't ever stop fighting.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.882
Good-bye, Jules.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.588
You did good
today, Artie.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.357
Your wife would
be proud.

37:38.390 --> 37:40.492
Thank you.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.860
Uh, hug, come on.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.395
Give a hug.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.630
After all we've been
through, come on.

37:44.663 --> 37:45.964
Come on.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.499
(laughs)

37:47.533 --> 37:49.000
(camera shutter clicks)

37:49.034 --> 37:50.001
Okay.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.870
All right.
Oh, hey!

37:51.903 --> 37:53.839
Don't I get, like,
an FBI badge or something?

37:53.872 --> 37:56.308
I mean, after all, I did
kind of save the day.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.809
Okay, a gun? A flak jacket?

37:57.843 --> 37:59.345
A sticker?
A sticker would be fine.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.412
I'll take a sticker.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.882
You should have
called me, Elijah.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.384
You understand
that, right?

38:05.417 --> 38:06.852
Yeah.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.621
I do.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.623
I'm sorry.

38:11.657 --> 38:14.393
You didn't think
I'd trust your judgment?

38:14.426 --> 38:15.961
Honestly, no.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.029
And, listen, given...

38:18.063 --> 38:20.699
given some of my
behavior recently,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.668
I wouldn't blame you.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.802
All right, but the clock
was ticking,

38:23.835 --> 38:26.037
and I did what I
thought was right.

38:26.071 --> 38:27.906
And I'd like to think that
I was smart, not lucky,

38:27.939 --> 38:29.441
that it all worked out.

38:29.475 --> 38:32.444
You were lucky.

38:32.478 --> 38:34.480
And you would be smart
not to do that again.

38:42.488 --> 38:43.722
RUSSELL:
I'm going home.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.824
I'm tired.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.626
Is that your daughter Hannah?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.728
(quietly):
Yeah.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.466
That's my baby.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.734
Mm, my little girl.
(laughs)

38:57.135 --> 38:58.704
(laughs)

38:58.737 --> 39:00.639
She's with her friend Grace.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.009
Grace's mom was Hannah's nanny.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.677
They played together
all the time.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.879
They were practically
inseparable.

39:09.915 --> 39:14.686
But after the accident,
Hannah died, I...

39:14.720 --> 39:18.457
I guess I... cut them
out of my life.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.827
Why'd you do that?

39:23.094 --> 39:26.064
Grace's mom was driving Hannah.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.702
It was raining,
it wasn't her fault.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.003
Oh.

39:33.772 --> 39:37.843
Grace left me this letter
in the lobby today.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.712
She wants to be
in my life again.

39:40.746 --> 39:41.813
I called her.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.682
She's on her way
over here now.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.818
But I don't...
I don't think I can do this.

39:46.852 --> 39:49.721
It's just...

39:49.755 --> 39:51.990
(voice breaking):
There's too many memories. I...

39:52.023 --> 39:54.793
Mm, oh, that's hard.

39:54.826 --> 39:58.063
Boy, I don't know
what I would do. I'd...

40:00.899 --> 40:04.670
You know, I know
this is gonna sound silly, but

40:04.703 --> 40:05.771
do you remember
the Greek myth

40:05.804 --> 40:07.939
about Theodous?

40:07.973 --> 40:10.141
He-he was a Greek
god, like a distant

40:10.175 --> 40:12.210
brother to Apollo,
or something like that.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.513
Anyway, so Theodous
is coming down

40:14.546 --> 40:16.915
from Mount Olympus
with his firstborn son

40:16.948 --> 40:21.052
to go swimming in this
beautiful river in the valley.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.689
But his-his son
doesn't know how,

40:23.722 --> 40:26.525
so Theodous
entrusts him to this

40:26.558 --> 40:28.827
beautiful peasant woman.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.096
But when he came back,
Theodous was heartbroken

40:31.129 --> 40:34.733
to find out that the woman
had lost his child.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.802
I mean,
it was an honest mistake.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.137
But Theodous was heartbroken.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.774
Time passed, he forgave her,
and they even got married,

40:42.808 --> 40:44.075
and they had
another son.

40:44.109 --> 40:45.777
But every day,
every single day,

40:45.811 --> 40:48.980
Theodous would remember
his firstborn son.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.984
But the love that he was getting
back from his new family

40:53.018 --> 40:55.453
brought him joy, and he was...

40:56.755 --> 40:58.490
...heartbroken no more.

40:58.524 --> 41:00.025
Hmm.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.560
Hmm.
What do you think?

41:01.593 --> 41:02.828
(laughs)

41:02.861 --> 41:04.195
I think two things.

41:04.229 --> 41:07.866
First, you completely
made up that story,

41:07.899 --> 41:10.902
because you're a little rascal.

41:10.936 --> 41:13.505
And two, you made me smile.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.841
I want to thank you for that.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.276
I'm glad.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.278
Good night.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.614
Good night.
GRACE: Hi.
RUSSELL: Hi.

41:24.783 --> 41:25.751
(laughs)

41:25.784 --> 41:27.218
Grace.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.287
Hi.
I'm so sorry
I didn't recognize you

41:29.320 --> 41:31.089
this morning in the lobby.

41:31.122 --> 41:33.792
Grace, you're
so beautiful.

41:33.825 --> 41:34.760
(laughs)

41:34.793 --> 41:36.662
You have your mom's smile.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.298
I found these photos

41:40.331 --> 41:43.268
that I put in the letter
while I was packing for college.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.904
I found this one
in the bottom of my drawer.

41:45.937 --> 41:47.606
Made me think of you.

41:47.639 --> 41:48.740
(laughs)

41:48.774 --> 41:51.910
Oh, my little ice cream monster!

41:51.943 --> 41:53.812
She always had
ice cream on her shirt.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.648
Yeah, she could never
keep it on the cone

41:56.682 --> 41:59.217
'cause she wanted to eat all
of the chocolate chips first.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.820
(laughs)

42:07.125 --> 42:09.227
How is your mom?

42:09.260 --> 42:11.062
She's good.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.098
Yeah, she's real good.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.768
I missed you a lot.

42:16.802 --> 42:18.837
And Hannah.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.306
Yeah, me, too.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.677
Avery, I am...

42:25.711 --> 42:27.946
I'm so sorry.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.021
I'm so happy you're here.
