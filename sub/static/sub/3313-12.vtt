WEBVTT

00:07.678 --> 00:10.080
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.641
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU!

00:11.642 --> 00:14.184
I GOTTA TELL YOU, MRS. BENG, YOU
SNAGGED A REAL GOOD ONE HERE.

00:14.185 --> 00:17.016
THIS BACK MASSAGER I THINK IS THE
STEAL OF THE WHOLE YARD SALE.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.549
OH, AND MEL PROMISED ME
THAT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR

00:19.550 --> 00:22.223
SHE ONLY USED ON HER BACK, SO.

00:24.055 --> 00:25.795
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU!

00:25.796 --> 00:28.358
I CANNOT BELIEVE THE
CRAP PEOPLE BOUGHT.

00:28.359 --> 00:30.400
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THE
CRAP YOUR AUNT OWNS.

00:30.401 --> 00:32.302
Mel: I HEARD THAT.

00:32.303 --> 00:35.505
MY STUFF IS NOT CRAP.
IT'S VINTAGE AMERICANA.

00:35.506 --> 00:37.307
A SINGING BASS?

00:37.308 --> 00:40.370
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FUNNY
THAT IS WHEN YOU'RE DRUNK.

00:40.371 --> 00:43.114
...ON LIFE AND FRIENDS.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.118
WELL, NOW THAT YOU'VE COME DOWN
FROM YOUR GARAGE-SALE HIGH,

00:48.119 --> 00:49.579
I CAN TELL YOU MY NEWS:

00:49.580 --> 00:52.522
I GOT APPROACHED ABOUT RUNNING
FOR THE STATE SENATE NEXT YEAR.

00:52.523 --> 00:54.754
I'M ON A SHORT LIST WITH
THREE OTHER PEOPLE!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.326
- IT'S A GOOD THING WE KEPT THIS.
- ( beeps )

00:56.327 --> 00:58.328
Awesome! Way to go!

00:58.329 --> 00:59.829
- You're the best!
- ( beeps )

00:59.830 --> 01:02.493
MMM, THAT MUST BE WHAT IT SOUNDS
LIKE IN YOUR HEAD ALL THE TIME.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.096
IT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

01:06.097 --> 01:08.168
THAT'S GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE
SENATE THING, AUNT MEL,

01:08.169 --> 01:11.070
BUT IS IT AS GREAT AS THIS
FANTASTIC PARADE OF PRESIDENTS?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.303
- WHOOP!
- WE SOLD YOUR RATTY ELECTRIC BLANKET,

01:13.304 --> 01:16.106
YOUR LINT LIZARD, YOUR OLD
NIGHTSTAND, YOUR LAVA LAMP...

01:16.107 --> 01:18.077
WHOA, BACK IT UP.
MY OLD NIGHTSTAND?!

01:18.078 --> 01:20.480
- TO WHO?
- ANDREW, THAT DUDE DOWN THE STREET

01:20.481 --> 01:24.114
WITH THE PORSCHE AND THE
VAGUELY RACIST LAWN JOCKEYS.

01:24.115 --> 01:27.086
BUT YOU EMPTIED IT OUT FIRST
BEFORE YOU GAVE IT TO HIM, RIGHT?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.489
NO, THERE WAS JUST SOME OLD JUNK IN
THERE: A COUPLE OF MATCHBOOKS...

01:29.490 --> 01:32.091
OH, AND A VIDEOTAPE OF
THE 2002 WORLD SERIES.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.794
SPOILER ALERT: THE ANGELS WON.

01:34.795 --> 01:38.097
WE WERE GONNA TOSS IT, BUT ANDREW
SAID HE WAS A FAN OF BASEBALL,

01:38.098 --> 01:39.869
- SO HE WAS PSYCHED TO HAVE IT.
- OH REALLY?

01:39.870 --> 01:42.602
UH, RYDER, I NEED YOU
TO DO ME A FAVOR?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.574
UM, I NEED YOU TO
SELL THIS BASS.

01:44.575 --> 01:46.136
- YEAH.
- WHAT?

01:46.137 --> 01:49.139
- GO DOOR TO DOOR.
- BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

01:49.140 --> 01:51.641
JUST FIND A DRUNK WHO
NEEDS A GOOD LAUGH.

01:51.642 --> 01:53.883
HOW COULD YOU SELL
MY NIGHTSTAND?!

01:53.884 --> 01:56.115
YOU TOLD ME TO GET RID
OF ALL YOUR OLD JUNK.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.847
OKAY, THAT TAPE WAS NOT JUNK!

01:57.848 --> 02:00.590
"WORLD SERIES" WAS CODE
FOR A VERY PERSONAL,

02:00.591 --> 02:02.252
VERY PRIVATE RECORDED MOMENT

02:02.253 --> 02:04.195
BETWEEN ME AND MY
THEN-BOYFRIEND.

02:05.656 --> 02:07.228
OHHH, MY GOODNESS.

02:08.759 --> 02:12.362
WOW, YOUNG BURKE MADE A
LITTLE SEX TAPE, HUH?

02:12.363 --> 02:14.804
NO, I WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

02:14.805 --> 02:17.507
IT WAS A LOVE TAPE.

02:17.508 --> 02:19.169

02:40.461 --> 02:43.393
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW "2002
WORLD SERIES, GAME SEVEN"

02:43.394 --> 02:46.236
- WAS CODE FOR "SEX TAPE"?
- HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?!

02:46.237 --> 02:49.439
DID YOU REALLY THINK I HAD AN EMOTIONAL
CONNECTION TO A BASEBALL GAME?

02:49.440 --> 02:52.202
YOU KNOW, I WAS ON THE SHORT
LIST FOR STATE SENATE, JOE!

02:52.203 --> 02:53.873
NOW THAT'S OVER!
NOW THAT THERE'S

02:53.874 --> 02:56.647
A TAPE OUT THERE OF ME...
PLAYING BALL.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.809
VOTERS DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.782
HONESTLY IT DEPENDS ON THE DEMO.
I THINK MALES 18 TO 35

03:02.783 --> 03:05.855
- MIGHT ACTUALLY VOTE FOR YOU, LIKE, TWICE.
- ( scoffs )

03:05.856 --> 03:07.787
UGH. THIS IS THE
WORST THING EVER.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.490
HEY, YOU KNOW THAT CONVICT
I'VE BEEN WRITING TO?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.462
NEW WORST THING EVER.

03:12.463 --> 03:14.264
WHAT CONVICT? NEED MORE DETAILS.

03:14.265 --> 03:16.866
I TOLD YOU, THE GUY FROM THE
NONPROFIT I'M VOLUNTEERING AT...

03:16.867 --> 03:18.798
- "GUILT-FREE."
- THAT'S ABOUT GUYS IN JAIL?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.870
I THOUGHT THAT WAS
ABOUT NON-FAT COOKIES.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.732
INNOCENT PEOPLE LANGUISH IN JAIL

03:22.733 --> 03:24.704
BECAUSE OF OUR CORRUPT
JUDICIAL SYSTEM!

03:24.705 --> 03:27.537
WE RESEARCH THEIR CASES AND
WRITE THEM LETTERS OF SUPPORT.

03:27.538 --> 03:30.280
HONEY, CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE
ME AND MEET GUYS IN BARS

03:30.281 --> 03:32.942
INSTEAD OF BEHIND THEM?
WHAT DID THIS GUY DO?

03:32.943 --> 03:35.315
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. THAT'S
WHAT I CAME TO TELL YOU...

03:35.316 --> 03:38.618
HIS CASE IS BEING REVIEWED AND THEY'LL
BE ABLE TO PROVE HE WAS WRONGLY ACCUSED.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.550
YEAH? WHAT WAS THE
CHOIRBOY CHARGED WITH?

03:40.551 --> 03:43.793
PFFFT! TAKING MONEY FROM A BANK.

03:43.794 --> 03:46.256
YOU THINK BANK
ROBBERY IS "PFFFT"?!

03:46.257 --> 03:49.299
AT LEAST IT'S NOT
"PFFFT MURDER."

03:49.300 --> 03:51.961
BARELY ANY MONEY WAS STOLEN.
AND NONE OF IT BY DEVIN.

03:51.962 --> 03:53.863
YEAH? HE'S STILL GUILTY
IN THE COURT OF JOE.

03:53.864 --> 03:55.965
SO NO MORE LETTERS
TO OR FROM THIS GUY.

03:55.966 --> 03:57.968
WHY DO YOU HATE
JUSTICE SO MUCH?!

03:59.970 --> 04:01.971
THIS IS JUST GREAT. MY
REPUTATION IS RUINED

04:01.972 --> 04:03.773
AND LENNOX IS GOING
TO BE A PRISON WIFE.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.915
WHERE... WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:05.916 --> 04:09.319
OH, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A DANDY TIME
TO GET A PEDICURE AND INSTAGRAM A SELFIE.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.422
I'M GOING TO GET MY TAPE BACK!

04:13.584 --> 04:15.326
( electronic chiming )

04:20.291 --> 04:22.332
- ( beeps )
- LENNOX'S COMPUTER.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.263
Hey, dude. Can you
get Lennox for me?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.766
My lawyer gave me five
minutes with his computer

04:26.767 --> 04:29.499
and the guards get
antsy if I go over.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.900
GUARDS?

04:30.901 --> 04:34.374
OHH, YOU'RE THE GUY
IN THE BIG HOUSE,

04:34.375 --> 04:36.746
UP THE RIVER, SLAMMER MAN.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.648
HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

04:38.649 --> 04:40.910
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY COMPUTER?!
- OH, IT WAS RINGING.

04:40.911 --> 04:43.683
AND I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO MISS
A CALL FROM YOUR FRIEND...

04:43.684 --> 04:46.285
- IN PRISON.
- YOU CAN'T TELL AUNT MEL AND JOE!

04:46.286 --> 04:49.319
- OH, CAN'T I?
- WHAT IF WE JUST GO INTO THE KITCHEN

04:49.320 --> 04:51.991
- AND PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED?
- MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.425
COME ON, RYDER, YOU AND
DEVIN ARE KINDRED SPIRITS.

04:55.426 --> 04:58.768
THINK ABOUT IT: HE WAS
UNJUSTLY SENTENCED FOR A CRIME

04:58.769 --> 05:01.501
AND YOU WERE UNFAIRLY
SUSPENDED FOR A CRIME.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.974
- THAT'S TRUE.
- YEAH, YOU GUYS ARE LIKE BROTHERS.

05:04.975 --> 05:08.007
- BAD-ASS BROTHERS!
- YEAH, WE ARE.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.310
AND HOMIES DON'T RAT OUT HOMIES.

05:11.942 --> 05:14.444
Hey, guys? Guys?

05:14.445 --> 05:17.016
- Anybody?
- ( buzzes )

05:17.017 --> 05:19.490
I only get to video
chat like once a week.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.054
( clears throat )

05:27.998 --> 05:30.430
HOLD ON, SOME BARBIE'S
BEGGING FOR CHARITY.

05:30.431 --> 05:34.534
YOU GOT 60 SECONDS. I'M ABOUT TO
CLOSE A DEAL TO BUY A SHOPPING MALL.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.706
GO!

05:36.707 --> 05:38.037
HEY, IT MAY BE A LITTLE LATE,

05:38.038 --> 05:40.370
BUT WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!
I'M MEL BURKE

05:40.371 --> 05:42.942
- FROM DOWN THE STREET.
- 55 SECONDS.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.845
OKAY, MY NANNY ACCIDENTALLY
SOLD YOU A NIGHTSTAND

05:45.846 --> 05:47.817
AND IT'S EXTREMELY
SENTIMENTAL TO ME.

05:47.818 --> 05:51.080
I'D LIKE TO BUY IT BACK FROM YOU
ALONG WITH ANY CONTENTS THEREIN.

05:51.081 --> 05:53.523
I WILL EVEN THROW IN
THIS SHINY NEW JACKSON.

05:53.524 --> 05:55.555
IT MIGHT HELP YOU
WITH THAT MALL DEAL.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.958
WAIT, I KNOW YOU! YOU'RE
THAT COUNCILWOMAN

05:58.959 --> 06:01.591
WHO PUT IN THE SPEED BUMPS IN
FRONT OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.063
- GUILTY AS CHARGED.
- THAT WAS MY SHORTCUT HOME.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.996
I DRIVE A PORSCHE AND THAT
STREET IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

06:06.997 --> 06:09.999
WAS THE ONLY PLACE IN TOWN I
COULD REALLY OPEN HER UP.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.872
BUT YOU SEE, WHILE YOU
LOST YOUR RACETRACK,

06:12.873 --> 06:15.905
OTHERS GAINED A MORE
IMPORTANT PUBLIC GOOD:

06:15.906 --> 06:17.807
THEIR YOUNG, INNOCENT LIVES?

06:17.808 --> 06:20.080
- SEE, THE WAY DEMOCRACY WORKS IS...
- OH, TIME'S UP!

06:22.583 --> 06:24.554
WE APPRECIATE YOUR VIEWS...

06:24.555 --> 06:26.987
MR. BITE ME!

06:34.064 --> 06:36.896
WELL, I DIDN'T GET THE TAPE BACK.
MY LIFE IS OVER.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.499
YOU CAN SELL THE REST OF THE
FURNITURE AND THE HOUSE.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.771
I'LL JUST LIVE IN A BOX

06:41.772 --> 06:44.675
BEHIND THE SUPERMARKET WITH
THE REST OF THE SEX PERVERTS.

06:46.477 --> 06:49.439
RELAX, WOULD YOU? MAKING A SEX TAPE
IS HARDLY GOING TO RUIN YOUR LIFE.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.410
HECK, A LOT OF PEOPLE
USE IT AS A SPRINGBOARD

06:51.411 --> 06:53.484
TO MOVE ON TO BIGGER AND
BETTER THINGS, LIKE...

06:54.685 --> 06:56.487
M-MARRYING RAPPERS.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.719
- THANKS FOR HELPING.
- LOOK, THIS ANDREW GUY

06:59.720 --> 07:01.491
IS PROBABLY NOT GONNA
EVEN WATCH THAT TAPE.

07:01.492 --> 07:03.192
FIRST OF ALL, HE'D HAVE TO FIND A V.C.R.
TO WATCH IT ON...

07:03.193 --> 07:05.895
I MEAN THAT ALONE
COULD TAKE YEARS.

07:05.896 --> 07:08.197
THE UNCERTAINTY IS
ALMOST THE WORST PART.

07:08.198 --> 07:11.461
HOW CAN I LIVE NEVER KNOWING
WHEN THE OTHER BOOB MIGHT DROP?

07:11.462 --> 07:13.062
HEY, GREAT NEWS!

07:13.063 --> 07:14.504
THEY'RE GOING TO SHOW
YOUR TAPE ON TV.

07:14.505 --> 07:16.736
WHAT?! ALREADY?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.438
I JUST SAW THE PROMO. THEY'RE GOING
TO SHOW THE WHOLE THING UNCUT,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.741
NOT JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS!

07:21.742 --> 07:24.013
I'M JUST GOING TO GO
TAKE A NICE WARM BATH

07:24.014 --> 07:26.676
- WITH MY TOASTER.
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

07:26.677 --> 07:29.649
- RYDER, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- ESPN IS RERUNNING

07:29.650 --> 07:32.952
THE 2002 WORLD SERIES. YOU KNOW,
THE ONE YOU LIKE SO MUCH.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.185
OH, THE ACTUAL WORLD SERIES!

07:36.186 --> 07:40.630
THE ONE WITHOUT ALL THE CLOSE-UPS!
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

07:40.631 --> 07:42.462
I KNEW YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.966
OH, THIS NEWS IS SO EXCITING
THAT I NEED TO GO DRINK ALONE.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.540
RIGHT AFTER I RECORD THAT
BASEBALL GAME. HA HA!

07:52.172 --> 07:55.204
- I RARELY UNDERSTAND HER.
- FEW DO, YEAH.

07:55.205 --> 07:58.247
- SO, JOE, I'VE GOT A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
- OKAY.

07:58.248 --> 08:00.510
HOW 'BOUT WE GO HALFSIES ON THIS

08:00.511 --> 08:02.752
VINTAGE PINBALL MACHINE
I FOUND ON eBAY?

08:02.753 --> 08:04.614
YOU'VE BEEN BROWSING THE
INTERNET FOR ANTIQUES?

08:04.615 --> 08:06.215
WHAT, DID YOU ALREADY GO
THROUGH ALL THE PORN?

08:06.216 --> 08:08.217
NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY
REALLY COOL.

08:08.218 --> 08:10.560
I PLAYED THE SAME PINBALL
MACHINE IN ANDREW'S GARAGE

08:10.561 --> 08:12.192
WHEN I MOVED THE
NIGHTSTAND IN THERE.

08:13.263 --> 08:15.094
IT'S IN HIS GARAGE?

08:15.095 --> 08:16.996
THAT'S... THAT'S FANTASTIC.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.268
THAT'S AMAZING. I HAVE
TO GO TELL YOUR AUNT!

08:19.269 --> 08:21.732
SHE'S GOING TO BE SO HAPPY!
( laughs )

08:24.034 --> 08:26.636
SOMETHING'S GOING
ON IN THIS HOUSE.

08:26.637 --> 08:28.137
HEY, YOUR PROBLEM IS SOLVED.

08:28.138 --> 08:29.739
OH, GOOD, DID YOU BRING VODKA?

08:29.740 --> 08:31.911
'CAUSE THIS WINE IS
WUSSING OUT ON THE JOB.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.243
NO NO, I KNOW WHERE THE TAPE IS.
IT'S IN THE JERK'S GARAGE.

08:34.244 --> 08:36.185
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU AND
I ARE GOING TO STEAL IT.

08:36.186 --> 08:38.748
WHAT? STEAL IT?! ARE YOU CRAZY?!

08:38.749 --> 08:40.720
- DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
- YES!

08:40.721 --> 08:43.092
WE SHOULD SET HIS
GARAGE ON FIRE.

08:43.093 --> 08:46.556
OH, ARSON, THAT'S GREAT. WHAT'S
PLAN "C," A DRONE STRIKE?

08:46.557 --> 08:48.197
OH, I WONDER IF I CAN GET
MY HANDS ON A DRONE.

08:48.198 --> 08:50.029
MY DAD STILL HAS
SOME PULL IN D.C.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.001
YO, BURKE BURKE BURKE! FOCUS!

08:52.002 --> 08:54.734
OKAY, FINE, IF WE'RE GONNA BREAK IN,
WE HAVE TO DO IT AT THE RIGHT TIME.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.206
- THE GUY CAN'T BE THERE IF WE'RE GOING TO STEAL IT.
- STEAL WHAT?

08:57.207 --> 08:59.208
STEAL... HOME.

08:59.209 --> 09:02.211
WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT
THAT GREAT GAME, YOU KNOW,

09:02.212 --> 09:05.575
WHERE THE HITTER-BATTER-
RUNNER-GUY STOLE HOME.

09:05.576 --> 09:08.077
- SOMEONE STOLE HOME IN THE WORLD SERIES?
- WELL WELL, THEY...

09:08.078 --> 09:10.279
THEY DIDN'T EXACTLY STEAL HOME.
IT WAS MORE THAT THE...

09:10.280 --> 09:14.584
THE CATCHER ALLOWED
HIM TO SCORE.

09:14.585 --> 09:17.326
WELL, THE CATCHER
WAS YOUNG AND NAIVE

09:17.327 --> 09:21.260
AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE WHOLE WORLD
WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THE BIG PLAY.

09:21.261 --> 09:24.795
THAT ALL SOUNDS VERY EXCITING.
DID HE SLIDE IN HEAD FIRST?

09:27.067 --> 09:30.299
I DON'T RECALL. DID HE, MEL?

09:30.300 --> 09:32.302
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT!

09:33.674 --> 09:35.575
HOW DID I MISS THIS GAME?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.310
BURKE, OKAY, TONIGHT
IS THE NIGHT.

09:41.311 --> 09:45.915
REALLY? BUT ALL MY BLACK SNEAKING-AROUND
CLOTHES ARE IN THE WASH.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.857
THERE'S A BIG MUDHENS
GAME TONIGHT.

09:47.858 --> 09:50.820
THIS GUY NEVER MISSES A GAME. HE'S
EVEN GOT MUDHEN STICKERS ON HIS CAR.

09:50.821 --> 09:53.062
WHAT KIND OF AN IDIOT PUTS
STICKERS ON A PORSCHE?

09:53.063 --> 09:55.324
HMM, AN IDIOT SMART
ENOUGH TO AFFORD ONE

09:55.325 --> 09:58.067
AND THEN NOT LOSE IT IN
A FINANCIAL SCANDAL?

09:58.068 --> 10:00.299
AT LEAST I DIDN'T VIDEOTAPE
MYSELF LOSING MY CAR.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.673
ANYWAY TONIGHT FROM 7:00 TO 10:00,
THAT'S GONNA BE OUR WINDOW.

10:03.674 --> 10:07.006
OKAY, TONIGHT AT 7:00 WE WILL
OFFICIALLY BECOME CRIMINALS.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.078
OH, THIS COULD BE THE
WORST THING EVER!

10:09.079 --> 10:12.111
DEVIN JUST CALLED
ME FROM PRISON!

10:12.112 --> 10:15.144
YOU HAVE TO STOP SAYING STUFF
LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT CAUSES THIS.

10:15.145 --> 10:17.286
HE WAS FINALLY EXONERATED.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.318
HE'S BEING RELEASED AND HE
WANTS TO COME OVER FOR DINNER.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.151
- WHAT? WHY?
- HE WANTS TO PERSONALLY THANK

10:22.152 --> 10:24.123
EVERYONE WHO HELPED
WORK FOR HIS RELEASE.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.396
OH, ESPECIALLY THE CUTE,
BLONDE, UNDERAGE ONES?

10:27.397 --> 10:29.398
COULDN'T HE JUST SEND
A THANK-YOU GIFT,

10:29.399 --> 10:32.131
LIKE A FRUIT BASKET OR
BALLOONS FILLED WITH HEROIN?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.734
I WANT TO SEE HIM.
AFTER ALL THESE MONTHS

10:34.735 --> 10:37.006
OF CORRESPONDING, I FEEL
LIKE WE REALLY CONNECTED.

10:37.007 --> 10:39.408
HONEY, HE CAN'T COME OVER HERE.
IT'S BAD FOR MY IMAGE.

10:39.409 --> 10:41.240
YEAH, YOUR IMAGE. 'CAUSE
THAT'S THE WORST PART

10:41.241 --> 10:42.912
ABOUT HAVING A CRIMINAL
HERE IN THE HOUSE.

10:42.913 --> 10:45.745
DEVIN'S NOT A CRIMINAL.
AND YOU'RE ON RECORD

10:45.746 --> 10:48.247
ADVOCATING FOR THE
REHABILITATION OF EX-CONS.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.250
YOU SAID IT WAS SOCIETY'S DUTY TO
GET THEM BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH!

10:51.251 --> 10:54.283
YES, BUT NOT ON THE
PATH TO OUR HOUSE.

10:54.284 --> 10:56.385
IF YOU EVER MEANT
ANYTHING YOU SAID EVER

10:56.386 --> 10:57.727
AND YOU HAVE ANY HEART AT ALL

10:57.728 --> 10:59.428
- YOU'LL LET HIM COME.
- I HAVE A HEART!

10:59.429 --> 11:02.291
UGH! FINE. YOUR LOWLIFE
PEN PAL CAN COME.

11:02.292 --> 11:04.093
GOOD, I'M GLAD YOU GUYS AGREED.

11:04.094 --> 11:06.395
- FOR THE RECORD I DO NOT AGREE.
- I ALREADY TOLD DEVIN

11:06.396 --> 11:08.667
HE COULD COME TONIGHT AT 7:00.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.340
- AT 7:00 TONIGHT?
- NOPE NOPE, THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.672
NO, MEL AND I ARE ACTUALLY
BUSY TONIGHT AT 7:00. SORRY.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.444
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CALL AND CANCEL.
- I CAN'T!

11:15.445 --> 11:18.277
HE GOT RELEASED SO I CAN'T CALL HIM IN
PRISON AND HE DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE YET.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.309
CAN YOU CALL HIS ANKLE
BRACELET OR SOMETHING?!

11:20.310 --> 11:24.013
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANKLE
BRACELET 'CAUSE HE'S NOT GUILTY.

11:24.014 --> 11:25.916
HE'S COMING TONIGHT
SO GET ON BOARD!

11:27.687 --> 11:29.358
THIS IS GREAT. THIS
IS JUST WHAT WE NEED:

11:29.359 --> 11:31.360
AN EX-CON IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT.

11:31.361 --> 11:34.894
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, "WELCOME! SIT
DOWN, PULL UP AN ELECTRIC CHAIR."

11:34.895 --> 11:36.395
NO NO NO, THINK ABOUT IT,

11:36.396 --> 11:39.328
THIS COULD BE A GOOD THING.
THE DINNER GIVES US AN ALIBI.

11:39.329 --> 11:41.330
WE SNEAK OUT FOR FIVE
MINUTES, GET THE TAPE BACK,

11:41.331 --> 11:44.373
AND WE'RE BACK HERE EATING RISOTTO WITH
PORCINI LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

11:44.374 --> 11:47.737
YOU ARE MAKING RISOTTO WITH PORCINI, RIGHT?
BECAUSE I LOVE THAT.

11:47.738 --> 11:49.909
YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT PLAN
MIGHT ACTUALLY WORK.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.981
YEAH, PLUS IF
ANYTHING SEEMS FISHY,

11:51.982 --> 11:55.314
IT WOULDN'T HURT IF THERE JUST HAPPENS TO
BE AN EX-CON IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.748
SO YOU'D BE OKAY TO PIN OUR
CRIME ON AN INNOCENT MAN?

11:58.749 --> 12:02.051
NOT "PIN." JUST GENTLY
LEAN IT AGAINST HIM.

12:02.052 --> 12:04.093
I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL
GREAT ABOUT THAT.

12:04.094 --> 12:07.157
WELL, BUCK UP, LONGO,
'CAUSE TONIGHT WE RIDE.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.900
- PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.
- TONIGHT WE BOUNCE.

12:10.901 --> 12:15.404
- NO.
- COME WITH SOME POWDER 'CAUSE TONIGHT WE BUST A CAP!

12:15.405 --> 12:18.407
- WE DON'T EVEN OWN A GUN.
- OHHH.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.369
- IS THAT WHAT CAP MEANS?
- OH MY GOD.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.312
YOLO!

12:29.920 --> 12:31.821
YOU KNOW, DEVIN,

12:31.822 --> 12:34.954
SEEING YOU FRESH OUT OF PRISON
AND SITTING HERE NEXT TO LENNOX,

12:34.955 --> 12:38.227
IT'S REALLY HARD TO PUT INTO
WORDS WHAT I'M FEELING.

12:38.228 --> 12:40.089
BUT IT'S GOOD THINGS, RIGHT?

12:40.090 --> 12:42.932
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL EVER PAY
LENNOX BACK FOR ALL SHE DID.

12:42.933 --> 12:44.834
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY HER BACK.
NOT AT ALL.

12:44.835 --> 12:46.435
JUST EAT YOUR MEAL, GO
HOME, WE'RE SQUARE.

12:46.436 --> 12:47.937
I JUST FEEL LIKE I
OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING.

12:47.938 --> 12:49.338
YOU WELCOMED ME INTO YOUR HOUSE.

12:49.339 --> 12:50.900
PEOPLE LIKE YOU USUALLY
STEER CLEAR OF ME.

12:50.901 --> 12:53.442
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE ARE THOSE?

12:53.443 --> 12:56.275
THOSE ARE... THOSE
ARE CRAZY PEOPLE.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.207
WOW, LOOK AT THE TIME!

12:58.208 --> 13:00.449
ACTUALLY, MEL, WE'D BETTER
GET CRACKIN' ON THAT SALAD,

13:00.450 --> 13:02.852
- IT BEING ALMOST 7:30 AND ALL.
- SHOOT. UH, YEAH.

13:02.853 --> 13:05.956
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL HELP BECAUSE
SALAD IS LIKE A TWO-PERSON JOB.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.859
YOU KNOW, I FEEL
YOU, MY BROTHER.

13:09.860 --> 13:11.991
AFTER I WAS SLAPPED
WITH MY DRUG OFFENSE,

13:11.992 --> 13:13.522
EVERYONE I WAS CLOSE
TO ABANDONED ME.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.925
ON FACEBOOK.

13:15.926 --> 13:16.966
I DID A LITTLE MORE RECON.

13:16.967 --> 13:18.227
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST.

13:18.228 --> 13:20.499
THAT'S THE GARAGE.
THAT'S THE WINDOWS.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.831
- WHAT'S THAT?
- WHAT'S WHAT?

13:21.832 --> 13:24.403
THAT RIGHT THERE!
THAT'S AN ALARM SIGN!

13:24.404 --> 13:26.876
HOW COULD YOU MISS IT?! IT'S
BRIGHT RED AND SAYS "ALARM."

13:26.877 --> 13:28.078
ACTUALLY IT SAYS "LARM."

13:29.409 --> 13:32.341
OH, MAYBE THEY WERE TRYING
TO KEEP OUT THE "URGLARS."

13:32.342 --> 13:35.184
WELL, I... THE BUSH
IS BLOCKING THE SIGN!

13:35.185 --> 13:37.847
IF WE DON'T GO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE
GONNA MISS OUR OPPORTUNITY.

13:37.848 --> 13:40.819
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DISABLE AN ALARM
WITHOUT ANY PROFESSIONAL KNOW-HOW?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.421
...THAT'S WHAT PRISON IS MOSTLY,

13:42.422 --> 13:44.323
A BUNCH OF CRIMINALS
TEACHING EACH OTHER

13:44.324 --> 13:46.225
HOW TO DO A BETTER JOB
OF STEALING STUFF.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.557
GO ON.

13:48.558 --> 13:50.329
NAH, THAT'S BORING, YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.301
SURE WE DO. NO, IT'S
VERY INTERESTING,

13:52.302 --> 13:55.564
SOCIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING. YOU KNOW,
WHY PEOPLE DO THE THINGS THEY DO?

13:55.565 --> 13:56.936
YEAH, OR HOW THEY DO THEM...

13:56.937 --> 13:59.368
LIKE SPECIFICALLY
RESIDENTIAL JOBS.

13:59.369 --> 14:02.571
SAY, WITH... I DON'T
KNOW, ALARMS.

14:02.572 --> 14:04.473
- WHERE IS THIS GOING?
- HE'S OUR GUEST.

14:04.474 --> 14:06.845
IT'S POLITE TO ASK GUESTS
ABOUT THEIR INTERESTS.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.117
THE FACT IS I DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF

14:08.118 --> 14:09.448
FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE
OF THIS STUFF.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.280
MY BUDDY JUST TOLD ME TO
SIT AND WAIT IN THE CAR

14:11.281 --> 14:12.621
WHILE HE GOT SOME MONEY.

14:12.622 --> 14:14.223
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY.

14:14.224 --> 14:16.385
WHAT ABOUT YOUR CELLMATE? DID
HE EVER DISABLE AN ALARM?

14:16.386 --> 14:17.957
OH YEAH YEAH,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.088
HE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

14:19.089 --> 14:21.160
- HE WAS QUITE THE BURGLAR.
- ( laughs )

14:21.161 --> 14:23.562
- SO HOW DID HE DO IT?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.395
MOST OF THE TIME I'D JUST TUNE
HIM OUT AND STUDY MY BIBLE.

14:26.396 --> 14:28.998
THIS GUY'S USELESS.

14:28.999 --> 14:31.040
YEP. OKAY, ACTUALLY,
LOOK AT THE TIME.

14:31.041 --> 14:32.641
I HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.544
IT'S TIME TO TRIM THE...
ROSEMARY.

14:35.545 --> 14:38.647
WAIT, I'LL GO WITH YOU. 'CAUSE
ROSEMARY REALLY IS A TWO-PERSON JOB.

14:38.648 --> 14:41.251
LIKE SALAD.

14:43.053 --> 14:45.915
GREENS SEEM VERY
IMPORTANT TO THEM.

14:45.916 --> 14:48.018
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET
THROUGH MY TIME HERE, MAN.

14:49.059 --> 14:50.659
YOU'RE NOT IN PRISON!

14:50.660 --> 14:52.422
WE HAVE PUDDING POPS HERE!

14:54.394 --> 14:57.266
HOW DO YOU SPEND SIX MONTHS IN PRISON AND
NOT LEARN HOW TO DISABLING AN ALARM?!

14:57.267 --> 14:58.667
I DON'T KNOW. THE GUY'S
NOT A GOOD STUDENT.

14:58.668 --> 15:01.000
CLEARLY HE WASN'T PAYING
ATTENTION, YOU KNOW?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.601
PRISON IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.974
( sighs ) ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE
REALLY GOING TO DO THIS?

15:04.975 --> 15:06.936
WHAT ABOUT THE ALARM?
WHAT IF WE GET CAUGHT?

15:06.937 --> 15:09.979
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET CAUGHT, BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE DOING THIS.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.941
- I AM.
- BUT WE'RE A TEAM.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.542
NO, MEL, LOOK, YOU
NEED TO STAY HERE.

15:13.543 --> 15:16.915
WE CAN'T LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE
WITH "SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION."

15:16.916 --> 15:19.048
DEVIN, THE BIBLE STUDY KID?

15:19.049 --> 15:20.689
WHAT, ARE YOU AFRAID HE'S
GOING TO BAPTIZE SOMEBODY?

15:20.690 --> 15:23.522
NO NO, LOOK, IT'S
MORE THAN THAT.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.624
I MEAN, IF YOU GET CAUGHT,
YOUR CAREER IS OVER.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.528
ME... I'M WORKING HERE. I'M ALREADY
PAYING FOR A CRIME I DIDN'T COMMIT.

15:29.529 --> 15:33.532
AND IF I HAVE TO, I
CAN DO IT AGAIN.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.664
- JOE...
- MEL, SHH SHH.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.069
LOOK, IF I DON'T COME BACK,
JUST PROMISE ME ONE THING.

15:40.410 --> 15:42.341
ANYTHING.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.475
WHEN THAT KITCHEN TIMER BEEPS,
YOU TAKE THE CHICKEN OUT, OKAY?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.617
BUT YOU MAKE SURE THE
JUICES RUN CLEAR

15:48.618 --> 15:51.480
BECAUSE NO ONE WILL
GET FOOD POISONING

15:51.481 --> 15:53.653
FROM A JOE LONGO CHICKEN.

16:02.993 --> 16:05.564
...GOING TO PRISON FOR A CRIME
I DIDN'T COMMIT WAS ROUGH.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.965
BUT THE WORST PART
WAS KNOWING THAT

16:06.966 --> 16:08.567
MY BEST FRIEND BETRAYED ME.

16:08.568 --> 16:12.041
HE DID THE CRIME,
BUT I DID THE TIME.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.443
Mel: I'M SORRY, OKAY?!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.046
I MEAN, I'M SORRY THAT YOU
HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT...

16:17.047 --> 16:20.049
DEVIN. YOU KNOW,

16:20.050 --> 16:22.181
I GOTTA TO GO DO A THING.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.413
AT A PLACE WITH A GUY.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.086
AHHH, OH OW!

16:28.088 --> 16:30.589
( clicks )

16:30.590 --> 16:32.721
WAIT, STOP! THE
BREAK-IN'S OFF, OKAY?

16:32.722 --> 16:34.723
I CAN'T LET YOU GO UP THE RIVER...
OR DOWN THE RIVER

16:34.724 --> 16:36.395
OR WHICHEVER WAY THE RIVER GOES.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.527
- WHAT?!
- SO THE TAPE GETS OUT THERE.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.499
MY CAREER TAKES A HIT.
I GO TO BEAUTY SCHOOL.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.001
I SPEND THE REST OF MY DAYS SWEEPING
UP LITTLE OLD LADIES' HAIR.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.504
IT'S NOT A BAD LIFE. BUT I CAN'T
LET YOU GO TO JAIL FOR ME.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.406
SO JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING.
FORGET IT.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.778
BUT I'M HERE

16:49.779 --> 16:51.740
AND I'M PUMPED

16:51.741 --> 16:55.013
AND THE WINDOW'S OPEN.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.486
- GET IN THERE! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
- OKAY, HOLD ON.

16:57.487 --> 16:58.747
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
I'M GONNA GO FIRST.

16:58.748 --> 17:00.350
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
- LET ME GO FIRST.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.352
- HELP ME!
- WE'RE GOOD. COME ON IN HERE.

17:03.353 --> 17:05.054
- MY JEANS ARE TIGHT.
- I GOT YOU, THAT'S GOOD.

17:05.055 --> 17:06.495
WATCH WHAT YOU'RE
GRABBING, LONGO.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.297
IF ONLY YOU'D SAID THAT
TO YOUR OWN BOYFRIEND,

17:08.298 --> 17:10.230
- MAYBE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE BREAKING IN HERE RIGHT NOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.033
HEY, LOOK AT THIS!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.705
IT'S AN OLD VINTAGE MS. PAC-MAN.

17:16.706 --> 17:19.108
OH, THIS WAS MY FIRST TRUE LOVE.

17:19.109 --> 17:22.311
SHE WAS ALWAYS HUNGRY
AND READY FOR MORE.

17:22.312 --> 17:25.374
MMM, SET UP SORT OF AN
UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION, HUH?

17:25.375 --> 17:27.816
( sighs ) YEAH.

17:27.817 --> 17:29.378
( jangles, bells ringing )

17:29.379 --> 17:30.819
IT'S MAKING NOISE,
IT'S MAKING NOISE!

17:30.820 --> 17:32.352
SO ARE YOU! A LOT OF NOISE.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.525
OH, THAT WAS GOOD THINKING,
YOU KNOW, WITH THE PLUG.

17:36.526 --> 17:38.227
THANK YOU, YEAH.

17:38.228 --> 17:40.259
LOOK, YOU TAKE THAT SIDE.
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS SIDE.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.490
GO FIND YOUR NIGHTSTAND. HEY!

17:41.491 --> 17:43.733
- BE AS QUIET AS YOU CAN BE.
- OKAY.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.137
- ( shouts ) OH, MY NIGHTSTAND!
- BURKE!

17:48.138 --> 17:49.469
( whispers ) I MEAN,
MY NIGHTSTAND!

17:50.840 --> 17:52.671
OH YES, MY TAPE IS HERE!

17:52.672 --> 17:55.244
AH, WE ARE GOOD. WE
ARE ROBBING GENIUSES!

17:55.245 --> 17:56.745
- SHH.
- ( car approaching )

17:56.746 --> 17:58.407
HE'S BACK! HIDE HIDE!

17:58.408 --> 18:00.180
- WHAT?
- IN THERE, IN THERE, IN THERE!

18:03.813 --> 18:05.254
WHY IS HE HOME SO EARLY?

18:05.255 --> 18:06.656
I DON'T KNOW. I'LL GO ASK HIM.

18:08.418 --> 18:10.719
OKAY OKAY, LOOK, WE JUST
NEED A PLAUSIBLE STORY

18:10.720 --> 18:12.861
TO EXPLAIN WHY WE'RE IN HERE. OOOH...
SAY YOU KIDNAPPED ME!

18:12.862 --> 18:14.623
WHAT? WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
