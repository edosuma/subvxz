WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.768
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Princefield to emergency.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.234
Dr. Princefield to emergency.

00:14.810 --> 00:17.278
Dr. Forrest, please dial 11.

00:26.820 --> 00:29.186
This is a delaying tactic,
Your Honor. It's...

00:29.230 --> 00:31.357
She was just
contacted this morning.

00:31.390 --> 00:34.359
That's not a delaying tactic;
that's a simple procedural...
Sit down.

00:39.870 --> 00:41.360
Okay, let's begin.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.801
Judge Robert Parks,
emergency on-call justice,

00:44.840 --> 00:47.775
presiding over plaintiff request
for declaratory judgment

00:47.810 --> 00:50.347
on medical procedure...

00:50.380 --> 00:53.247
R-H-L-H-S.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.838
An emergency injunction

00:54.880 --> 00:57.644
preventing nonpayment
by insurance company

00:57.690 --> 00:58.645
Life State.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.214
Mr. Harper.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.649
Uh, Your Honor, we're asking
for a delay of eight hours.

01:02.690 --> 01:05.579
Our lead attorney was
caught unaware by this
emergency motion.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.190
Your Honor, this surgery
needs to happen now.

01:08.230 --> 01:09.197
Life State's strategy

01:09.230 --> 01:11.323
is to run down the clock.
They have no defense,

01:11.370 --> 01:13.292
so they want to make
your ruling irrelevant.
In three days time,

01:13.340 --> 01:15.399
my client's baby could be dead.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.361
Objection.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.809
Your client's fetus.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.809
Well, thank you, Mr. Harper.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.479
I'm sure we'll all feel much
better with that distinction.

01:23.510 --> 01:26.479
This is an emergency court.
You get your attorney

01:26.520 --> 01:29.216
in here, or you start arguing
for yourself.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.342
Do you understand?

01:30.390 --> 01:32.278
I do.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.617
(folk rhythm plays)

01:33.660 --> 01:36.754
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *

01:36.790 --> 01:39.452
* Round and round,
round and round *

01:39.500 --> 01:41.821
* The wheels on the bus
go round and round *

01:41.860 --> 01:42.827
(beep)

01:42.870 --> 01:44.360
* All through the town

01:47.440 --> 01:48.839
* Up and down,
up and down *

01:48.870 --> 01:52.374
* The people on the bus
go up and down *

01:52.410 --> 01:53.900
* All through the town

01:56.480 --> 01:59.415
* Beep-beep—beep,
beep-beep-beep... *

02:00.580 --> 02:02.411
Mrs. Florrick.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.712
Ms. Nyholm.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.150
Do you mind giving me
a hand here, please?

02:06.190 --> 02:07.851
Oh, boy or girl?
Girl.

02:07.890 --> 02:10.450
Unluclq you caught
Judge Parks, huh?

02:10.490 --> 02:12.629
That's not going to turn
out too well, is it?

02:12.660 --> 02:13.922
Why do you say that?

02:13.960 --> 02:15.723
Well, he's a pro-business
constructionist

02:15.760 --> 02:17.762
who never met an insurance
company he didn't lIke.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.631
Isn't that right?
(fussing)

02:19.670 --> 02:21.262
(baby talk): Yes, it is,
little baby.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.608
It is right.
Eh, pro-business
and pro-life.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.508
Ah, that's what you're hanging
your hat on, huh?

02:26.540 --> 02:28.508
I know a lot of pro-business
pro-lifers,

02:28.540 --> 02:31.407
and somehow business always
seems to win the upper hand.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.439
Do you mind?

02:32.480 --> 02:33.947
Here we go!

02:33.980 --> 02:35.413
WOMAN:
This is an ultrasound

02:35.450 --> 02:37.884
of the fetus' heart
taken six weeks ago,

02:37.920 --> 02:40.457
during the 18th week
of pregnancy.

02:40.490 --> 02:43.425
You're referring to my client,
Mrs. Willoughby's baby?

02:43.460 --> 02:44.620
Yes.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.820
As you can see here,

02:45.860 --> 02:47.657
the right ventricle
is enlarged,

02:47.700 --> 02:50.260
the left side severely
underdeveloped.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.291
It's hypoplastic
left heart syndrome--

02:52.340 --> 02:54.331
a uniformly fatal condition

02:54.370 --> 02:55.894
without in utero
surgical Intervention.

02:55.940 --> 02:58.204
And this is surgery performed
on the baby's heart--

02:58.240 --> 02:59.332
excuse me,

02:59.380 --> 03:00.938
the fetus' heart--
while still in the womb?

03:00.980 --> 03:02.709
Yes. It needs to happen

03:02.750 --> 03:05.548
by the 24th week,
two days from now.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.275
And the surgery is
scheduled for...?

03:07.320 --> 03:08.241
Well, 20 minutes ago.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.510
I had specialists flying in
from Los Angeles,

03:10.550 --> 03:12.415
Miami and Boston.
Until yesterday,

03:12.460 --> 03:13.916
when the insurance company
pulled the plug?

03:13.960 --> 03:17.680
Objection, Your Honor. Life
State did not "pull the plug."

03:17.730 --> 03:18.754
Ms. Nyholm, you're late.

03:18.790 --> 03:20.849
Yes, Your Honor.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.425
Mrs. Florrick buttonholed
me in the parking lot.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.426
Fetal surgery is simply

03:25.470 --> 03:26.664
not a covered procedure

03:26.700 --> 03:28.531
per the terms
of the Willoughbys' policy.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.403
This is an
experimental treatment.
(baby fussing)

03:31.440 --> 03:33.328
And we are not
in the business, of...

03:33.380 --> 03:34.574
My apologies, Your Honor.

03:34.610 --> 03:37.579
I found myself
without child care.

03:37.610 --> 03:38.941
And with a handy prop.

03:40.550 --> 03:41.869
Excuse me?

03:41.920 --> 03:45.515
That is cynicism of the
ugliest order, counselor.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.586
Your Honor, I know Mr. Gardner

03:47.620 --> 03:50.259
hasn't enjoyed the special bond
a mother has

03:50.290 --> 03:51.780
with her child...
Oh, come on.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.889
Life State just wanted
to put a pretty face

03:53.930 --> 03:56.592
on an ugly stratagem, and...
PARKS: Mr. Gardner, do you
have any further questions?

03:56.630 --> 03:57.858
Not at this time,
Your Honor.

03:57.900 --> 03:58.889
Ms. Nyholm?

03:58.930 --> 04:00.397
Yes, Your Honor,

04:00.440 --> 04:01.998
but she really needs to be fed.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.804
This is a stall tactic,
Your Honor.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.479
Yes, it's a stall tactic for me
to give my child sustenance.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.375
(fussing)
WILL: Your Honor,
we don't have time

04:09.410 --> 04:11.674
to delay this for even
five minutes, let alone...

04:11.710 --> 04:13.268
She really is very hungry.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.947
If we could just reconvene
in an hour?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.845
Ten minutes.

04:18.890 --> 04:23.850
* Daily walking close to thee

04:23.890 --> 04:25.448
* Let it be

04:25.490 --> 04:27.890
* Dear Lord, let it be...

04:27.930 --> 04:31.366
There, that's when
Mr. Daley stopped me.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.493
He said,
"No, Reverend, not that one.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.791
"Danny Boy."

04:34.840 --> 04:36.569
(laughing)

04:36.610 --> 04:38.430
So, your new boy's in trouble?

04:38.470 --> 04:38.959
Why do you say that?

04:39.010 --> 04:40.409
You phoned me.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.772
My guess is, Florrick
is polling well

04:42.810 --> 04:45.040
everywhere
except African-Americans.

04:46.950 --> 04:49.919
African-American women.

04:49.950 --> 04:53.613
He's polling ten points
behind last election.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.649
We think it's about crime.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.885
Well, it's about cheating.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.421
And you want me to help
kick off some kind of

04:59.460 --> 05:00.950
forgiveness
tour, right?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.661
Prayer breakfast.

05:02.700 --> 05:06.431
A few gracious words
about God's forgiveness,

05:06.470 --> 05:08.438
Peter's true repentance.

05:08.470 --> 05:09.801
Hey, it worked for Clinton.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.775
No, no, Bill had Hillary
out there doing press.

05:12.810 --> 05:13.970
Uh, it's not an option.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.877
Um, Mrs. Florrick is a
very private person.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.343
Look, I like Peter.

05:18.380 --> 05:20.371
He's been good for us.

05:20.420 --> 05:23.981
But the Lord in Christ Church
belongs to my son now.

05:24.020 --> 05:28.116
You get his blessing and I'll
happily pray with Peter.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.051
MRS. WILLOUGHBY:
It's just, it's so bizarre.

05:32.090 --> 05:35.799
We have insurance for exactly
this type of thing, and now

05:35.830 --> 05:38.628
we could sell off everything
and still not cover this.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.535
We're staying calm,
keeping positive.

05:40.570 --> 05:41.537
Right.

05:41.570 --> 05:44.960
It was a good day today.

05:45.010 --> 05:47.570
He started kicking again today.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.804
Any closer to a name?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.979
Not yet, we...

05:51.010 --> 05:52.568
We wanna make sure
we're all fIne first.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.544
NYHOLM: How did you get a
judge in here on Saturday?

05:55.580 --> 05:57.582
WILL: You didn't count
on that, did you?

05:57.620 --> 05:59.417
So, this isn't really
your baby, is it?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.586
What's her name?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.156
Bite me.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.680
Is that Dutch?

06:03.730 --> 06:06.119
(chuckles)
MAN: Excuse me, we're
back in session.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.821
NYHOLM: How many times
have you performed

06:07.860 --> 06:10.567
this fetal heart surgery
procedure, Dr. Hall?

06:10.600 --> 06:12.431
I'm not a pediatric
cardiologist.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.689
Yes, I understand that but
that would mean none, right?

06:15.740 --> 06:18.038
No criticism implied, ma'am,

06:18.070 --> 06:20.732
I just want to be
clear on all the facts.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.943
Yes, that's correct.
In fact,

06:23.980 --> 06:26.949
how many times has
fetal surgery for hypoplastic

06:26.980 --> 06:28.538
left heart syndrome
been attempted

06:28.580 --> 06:30.138
in Illinois, do you know?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.817
I must confess I don't.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.582
Four times.

06:37.790 --> 06:41.055
Now, Dr. Hall, how is that not
an experimental procedure?

06:41.100 --> 06:43.125
Objection.
It's not within her expertise.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.797
Sustained.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.593
I can see why
Mr. Gardner wouldn't

06:46.640 --> 06:48.596
want you to answer that.
No further questions.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.904
Ms. Nyholm, how long will you
need to prepare your defense?

06:50.940 --> 06:52.100
Well, Your Honor,

06:52.140 --> 06:54.836
I'm tempted to ask
for one week, except...

06:54.880 --> 06:55.778
24 hours.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.745
Except 24 hours is what I mean.

06:58.780 --> 07:02.079
Thank you, Pastor. Um...

07:02.120 --> 07:04.145
we feel Peter needs
spiritual gUIdance.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.782
He's paid his debt to society,

07:05.820 --> 07:07.458
but we know that
there's a greater debt.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.889
So, you want to use me.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.989
Yes.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.918
Why?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.724
It looks good if
I'm embraced by you.

07:18.770 --> 07:22.092
Our polling numbers are below
par with African-American women.

07:22.140 --> 07:24.700
So, is that the latest
scheme, Mr. Florrick?

07:24.740 --> 07:26.537
Brutal honesty?

07:26.580 --> 07:27.672
Son...

07:27.710 --> 07:29.871
No, wait, it's okay.

07:29.910 --> 07:34.711
Look, Reverend, I know that you
think I'm just a...

07:34.750 --> 07:37.639
shallow, narcissistic
politician, and you know what?

07:37.690 --> 07:40.557
I agree with you.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.922
ButI have been in prison
for the last eight months.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.019
I've been away
from my family,

07:45.060 --> 07:46.550
from my life.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.750
I've seen everything
I've built turn to dust.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.860
Until one day you found the
glorious words of the gospels.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.603
Can we have a minute alone?

08:03.580 --> 08:05.775
I'm not a photo op.
I know you're not.

08:05.810 --> 08:08.847
I won't be charmed,
finessed, yupped.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.017
You've done wrong.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.142
I know I have.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.612
Your marriage
is in trouble.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.787
I know you think
it isn't, but it is.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.687
Because you don't acknowledge
true repentance.

08:17.730 --> 08:19.550
Tell me what I have to do.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.295
You love your wife?

08:21.330 --> 08:23.867
Yes.
Does she love you?

08:23.900 --> 08:25.959
I don't know.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.139
You are sleeping
in separate rooms?

08:28.170 --> 08:31.139
Yeah.

08:31.170 --> 08:34.901
Do you believe Jesus
died for your sins?

08:36.910 --> 08:39.208
I don't know what that means.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.218
Do you want to know
what it means?

08:43.750 --> 08:44.842
No.

08:44.890 --> 08:46.289
(chuckles)

08:46.320 --> 08:47.787
"Please, God,

08:47.820 --> 08:49.788
make me good,
but just not yet."

08:49.830 --> 08:51.786
You're afraid of change.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.798
But your wife
won't love you,

08:53.830 --> 08:56.765
she won't return to your
bed till you change.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.667
So...

08:59.700 --> 09:02.760
do you want to change?

09:06.140 --> 09:08.301
Nyholm's not budging.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.774
Life State's worried
about setting a precedent

09:10.810 --> 09:13.074
that could cost them millions
in the class action.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.747
Where are you and Cary?

09:14.780 --> 09:17.613
We're still working up a list
of experimental procedures

09:17.650 --> 09:19.584
Life State's covered
in the past.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.259
Good. You okay?

09:22.290 --> 09:23.848
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:23.890 --> 09:26.757
I just don't like
investing myself emotionally.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.756
I know.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.893
We have a ﬁghting chance here.

09:30.930 --> 09:32.067
Get some sleep.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.364
Okay, thanks. Bye.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.163
(phone beeps off)
(sighs)

09:36.200 --> 09:39.203
(men speaking indistinctly)

09:44.410 --> 09:47.618
PASTOR: Jesus, we pray you to
embrace your lost sheep.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.845
Guide him back
to your flock.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.814
Show him your mercy.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.909
Let him know that his
sins will be forgiven.

09:55.960 --> 10:01.921
Merciful Jesus, restore to him
the joy of your salvation,

10:01.960 --> 10:05.760
and uphold him by
your generous spirit.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.804
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

10:16.410 --> 10:19.174
Even if you don't sympathize
with my clients...
Shh!

10:20.880 --> 10:23.883
Even if you don't
sympathize with my clients,

10:23.920 --> 10:25.683
this won't play well
in the press.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.188
Oh, come on, Will.
How bad do you think

10:28.220 --> 10:30.688
you can make an insurance
company look these days?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.379
Hey.
But we can pay

10:32.430 --> 10:34.193
for the operation.

10:34.230 --> 10:35.322
High six figures, right?

10:35.360 --> 10:37.863
Mr. Harper can cover that
with the stroke of a pen.

10:37.900 --> 10:41.097
WILL: If?
You drop the
class action suit.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.200
That's right, Will, let's
talk like adults here.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.299
You're not in this
to help some sweet couple

10:46.340 --> 10:48.103
have their first baby.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.072
Where's the paycheck in that?

10:49.110 --> 10:51.704
You know, there were 68
other sweet couples

10:51.750 --> 10:53.968
who were denied coverage
by Life State.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.842
Trial lawyers, defenders
of the just and the innocent.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.881
Just think about it.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.150
Drop your class action
nuisance suit,

11:02.190 --> 11:04.658
and we'll find the money
to save that baby.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.969
Can you grab
my bags, please?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.763
DIANE:
How's the Life State?

11:11.800 --> 11:15.292
Patti Nyholm
offered to pay,

11:15.340 --> 11:17.331
if we drop our class action.

11:17.370 --> 11:20.203
Ouch, might as well
close up shop.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.878
Yep, starting to make sense

11:21.910 --> 11:24.970
why she's fighting it
tooth and nail, though.

11:27.380 --> 11:28.870
_ Get the state_
insurance commi55ioner

11:28.920 --> 11:29.989
to apply some pressure.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.215
He won't get involved;
there's no political upside.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.353
He might for a friend.

11:33.390 --> 11:34.288
Are you...

11:34.320 --> 11:37.221
No, not me. Mr. Florrick.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.295
DIANE: It's a side benefit of
havmg her on staff, right?

11:42.330 --> 11:44.366
Use her connections.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.492
His connections.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.498
Her connection
to his connections?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.929
Is that a problem?

11:49.970 --> 11:51.267
No.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.279
I just think there
are better ways to go.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.198
ELI:
So,good,
the reverend's on board.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.174
Yes, he's seeing Peter
twice a week,

11:58.210 --> 11:59.814
and I'll petition the court
for monitored trips

11:59.850 --> 12:01.738
back and forth to the
Lord in Christ Church.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.748
And I'll slip an item to
Avedon and Palish,

12:03.790 --> 12:05.314
and we'll get a couple
of photographers there.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.454
Yeah, you might want to
hold off on that.

12:07.490 --> 12:09.117
Why?
Peter doesn't want it.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.457
He-- why?

12:10.490 --> 12:11.821
Pastor Isaiah.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.294
What's going on?

12:14.330 --> 12:16.093
Exactly what we wanted.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.267
Spiritual guidance.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.460
What we wanted
was a photo op.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.297
Yeah, and we'll get
that, eventually.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.398
And in the meantime?

12:21.440 --> 12:22.134
Peter's listening.

12:22.170 --> 12:25.230
I'm not liking
the sound of this.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.875
Religion's like a drug.
In small doses, it's curative.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.844
In large, it's addictive.
Talk to him.

12:29.880 --> 12:30.949
He won't listen to me.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.777
Not Peter,
the Reverend Isaiah.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.970
Pastor Isaiah,
and I'll tell you what,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.271
why don't you
talk to him?

12:36.320 --> 12:38.049
You'd be better.

12:38.090 --> 12:43.881
Eli, aren't we living in a
post-racial world these days?

12:43.930 --> 12:46.285
Okay, I'll do it.

12:46.330 --> 12:49.151
Won't this be entertaining.
(chuckles)

12:49.200 --> 12:50.895
I am incredibly sympathetic.

12:50.930 --> 12:54.366
I can't even imagine the
stress Kate must be under.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.099
But a rislq,
medically-unnecessary surgery

12:59.140 --> 13:00.937
is not the answer.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.471
To be fair,
you are a claims manager,

13:03.510 --> 13:06.377
not a medical professional.
Yes, uh...

13:06.410 --> 13:10.085
But that's why we hire
independent medical consultants,

13:10.120 --> 13:13.578
uh, retired doctors who
are contracted to

13:13.620 --> 13:16.885
evaluate medical records
and make a determination.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.922
And what was the consultant's
determination here?

13:19.960 --> 13:23.464
A fetal surgery is not
considered medically necessary

13:23.500 --> 13:26.367
when there is a tried
and tested alternative,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.459
as is waiting
until the baby's born.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.434
NYHOLM: No further
questions, Ms. Pomeroy.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.934
really goes out to this couple.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.374
So...

13:38.410 --> 13:42.449
as soon as Kate has the baby--

13:42.480 --> 13:45.347
if she has the baby-- you'll
pay for the surgery, correct?

13:45.390 --> 13:46.482
Yes, that's correct.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.853
It's covered
for a baby that's born?

13:49.890 --> 13:50.549
Right.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.306
In utero surgery for
spina bifida, 23 weeks.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.229
So as far as Life
State's concerned,

14:06.270 --> 14:08.374
this isn't a baby.
This isn't someone

14:08.410 --> 14:09.968
who qualifies for surgery.

14:10.010 --> 14:12.171
This, according to
your denial letter,

14:12.210 --> 14:15.441
is a pregnancy complication
not covered.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.243
Is that correct?
NYHOLM:
Objection, relevance.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.088
Overruled-- policy language
is relevant here.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.385
Unfortunately, that's right.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.182
No further questions.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.230
I'm a new mother myself,

14:33.270 --> 14:36.034
so I know how exciting
and overwhelming it is

14:36.070 --> 14:38.209
and how important it is
to guard your health.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.231
Ms. Nyholm, I get it.
You're a mom; we're
all impressed.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.272
Can we move this
along now?
Yes, Your Honor.

14:43.310 --> 14:47.246
Mrs. Willoughby,
do you understand
the risks of a surgery

14:47.280 --> 14:50.511
that would involve cutting
you open to reach your uterus?

14:50.550 --> 14:54.680
Cutting open your baby
to insert a balloon catheter

14:54.720 --> 14:57.257
into its heart?
To save his life.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.689
You forgot that part.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.154
His life, that's right.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.963
Because this is a life
we're talking about.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.524
Isn't it?

15:05.570 --> 15:07.993
Mrs. Willoughby, what do
you do for a living?

15:08.040 --> 15:11.168
Uh, I'm-I'm
a community organizer.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.563
Which involves?

15:12.610 --> 15:15.579
Uh, grass roots efforts towards

15:15.610 --> 15:18.306
social change protecting
civil rights.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.318
In fact, you spent
the last five years

15:20.350 --> 15:24.013
advocating for abortion rights,
didn't you?

15:24.050 --> 15:25.642
I lobbied for women's

15:25.690 --> 15:28.158
reproductive rights,
in general.
You spent years

15:28.190 --> 15:32.559
fighting to ensure that
a fetus at this stage

15:32.590 --> 15:34.558
could be aborted legally.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.694
Fighting to ensure
that there was a choice.

15:37.730 --> 15:40.437
And now that you're the one
with a fetus at 23 weeks,

15:40.470 --> 15:42.734
you argue that it should be
considered a baby...

15:42.770 --> 15:46.729
in fact, it is a life worth
saving... in fact,

15:46.770 --> 15:49.603
your baby deserves
the most cutting-edge,

15:49.640 --> 15:53.371
extreme life-saving
measures possible.
Yes.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.718
This is my child.

15:55.750 --> 15:59.709
Of course, he deserves anything.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.615
And you can live
with that hypocrisy?

16:01.660 --> 16:03.184
WILL:
Objection!

16:03.230 --> 16:04.652
Badgering the witness.

16:04.690 --> 16:06.624
Sustained.

16:09.330 --> 16:10.558
How you doing?

16:10.600 --> 16:13.433
(sighs) I don't know.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.131
I guess I've been better.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.489
WILL:
You did well.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.508
They're worried Patti
pushed it too far.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.269
It's hard to read this judge,

16:20.310 --> 16:21.732
but I think we have
a fighting chance.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.099
And if we lose?

16:23.150 --> 16:25.141
Then what?
WILL:
What do you mean?

16:25.180 --> 16:27.569
What are our options?

16:27.620 --> 16:28.644
Let's not worry about that now.

16:30.620 --> 16:33.316
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Forrest, dial 113, please.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.126
Dr. Forrest, please dial 113.

16:37.160 --> 16:40.129
(sighing)

16:40.160 --> 16:43.129
We can't drop
our class action.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.762
I know.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.463
There are 68 other couples
just like them.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.075
Yes, it's about
the firm, too.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.532
But we can't drop
the class action.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.105
I understand.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.744
Don't you like this?

16:59.780 --> 17:01.372
Being a lavwer.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.718
Isn't it fun?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.709
It has its moments.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.227
I can't tell

17:13.260 --> 17:14.557
which way he'll rule.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.398
(door rattles)

17:18.430 --> 17:20.295
Hold on, hold on.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.695
We're good.

17:22.740 --> 17:24.162
JUDGE:
Sorry about that.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.666
Damn it.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.645
Your Honor, I'm sorry.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.069
I need to raise a quick issue,
if you don't mind.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.476
I'm ready to rule, Ms. Nyholm.
Yes, Your Honor,
but everything about this

17:36.520 --> 17:39.444
emergency court has been
rushed and unorthodox,
and something has

17:39.490 --> 17:41.685
been brought to our attention
within the last ten minutes.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.153
What's she doing?

17:43.190 --> 17:44.327
Quickly, Ms. Nyholm.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.295
All this litigation has led
to a higher level of scrutiny

17:47.330 --> 17:49.594
of the Willoughbys' policy
application, and I'm afraid

17:49.630 --> 17:52.622
we've uncovered some
deal-changing issues.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.762
Oh, come on.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.336
Yes, Mr. Gardner.

17:55.370 --> 17:56.735
When we began
these proceedings,

17:56.770 --> 17:58.704
I didn't expect
Mr. Willoughby

17:58.740 --> 18:00.435
to misrepresent
his medical history.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.572
What?
JUDGE:
Sit down, sir.

18:01.610 --> 18:03.601
Sit down.
This misrepresentation

18:03.650 --> 18:04.844
gives Life State the right

18:04.880 --> 18:06.768
to rescind his
policy entirely.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.641
Your Honor, this is not
a buffet.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.147
Ms. Nyholm can't

18:10.190 --> 18:12.340
pick one attack and then
failing that, try another.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.381
Your Honor, I would argue
that this goes

18:14.420 --> 18:15.580
to the heart of contract law.

18:15.620 --> 18:19.226
Even if you are prone to rule
in the plaintiffs' favor,

18:19.260 --> 18:21.251
at the very minimum, you
should hear whether there was

18:21.300 --> 18:23.598
a legal contract to begin with.
Your Honor, I want
to remind you

18:23.630 --> 18:26.690
that we are racing against
a ticking clock. Ms. Nyholm

18:26.730 --> 18:28.595
is counting on this
surgery being irrelevant

18:28.640 --> 18:30.267
by the time you decide.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.735
Mr. Gardner, urgency
is not its own rationale.

18:36.780 --> 18:39.305
A just decision cannot,
will not be rushed.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.773
You still have two
days for the surgery.

18:41.820 --> 18:44.880
Ms. Nyholm,
prepare your witnesses

18:44.920 --> 18:48.219
and your exhibits, and I will
hear on this matter tomorrow.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.249
(gavelbangs)

18:52.690 --> 18:53.896
You understand what
you're doing here, Patti?

18:53.930 --> 18:55.397
You take away their
coverage altogether,

18:55.430 --> 18:57.318
that baby gets no
surgery at all.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.792
That's on you, Will.

18:58.830 --> 18:59.865
You have another option.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.834
Drop the class action.

19:05.510 --> 19:06.863
(sighs)

19:12.950 --> 19:16.613
PASTOR ISAIAH:
I want to speak to you today
about the path, God's path.

19:16.650 --> 19:20.416
Jesus said, "I am the way,
the truth and the life."

19:20.460 --> 19:23.258
When we walk with him, our
souls are right with him.

19:23.290 --> 19:25.281
EU:
I never realized you
rehearsed these sermons.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.493
Thought they just came down from
the Holy Spirit, like a dove.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.293
Hello, Mr. Gold.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.423
Reverend Isaiah.

19:32.470 --> 19:35.337
So, I believe I've been
crimping your style.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.362
Peter did wrong.

19:38.410 --> 19:39.536
He's sorry.

19:39.570 --> 19:40.707
He apologized to his wife.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.230
He apologized
to his constituents.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.646
He would now like to
apologize to his God.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.319
And I approve.

19:47.350 --> 19:49.409
No, sir.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.418
Reverend, you're doing
more than approving.

19:51.450 --> 19:54.317
You're trying to take advantage
of a man who's feeling raw

19:54.360 --> 19:55.782
about his mistakes.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.323
I love that word, "mistakes."

19:58.360 --> 20:02.296
Sleeping with a prostitute
is just like a dropped zero

20:02.330 --> 20:04.423
on a tax form.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.291
You're n
yo
U 9 S

20:07.340 --> 20:09.467
Youth tends to see things
in black and white.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.831
Things are black and white.

20:10.870 --> 20:13.805
So, let's put things into
black and white for you, then.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.899
Four point two grams
of crack cocaine--

20:15.940 --> 20:18.374
you were just short
of intent to distribute.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.344
And you want to what?

20:20.380 --> 20:23.645
Tell my congregation?
Shock them?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.510
You're gonna have to
look for something new.

20:25.550 --> 20:28.519
I could give you my
license plate number.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.883
Reverend, Peter could
make a difference...

20:32.930 --> 20:34.397
in people's lives.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.489
He needs to make a difference
in his life first.

20:36.530 --> 20:37.690
He has.

20:37.730 --> 20:39.721
No.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.735
I have to go.

20:43.770 --> 20:45.738
I've enjoyed this.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.931
Let's stay
in touch.

20:49.310 --> 20:50.868
ALICIA:
Mr. Willoughby,

20:50.910 --> 20:52.901
Life State is saying
that this question

20:52.950 --> 20:55.373
wasn't answered accurately.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.388
Can you see that?
Yes.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.617
You were_to check the box if
you had Circulatory problems,

21:00.660 --> 21:04.426
including but not limited
to chest pain, heart murmur,

21:04.460 --> 21:07.827
palpitations, phlebitis.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.623
Do you know
what that is?

21:09.660 --> 21:10.627
I don't.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.626
Funny, I don't either.
Do you?

21:12.670 --> 21:14.069
Objection.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.533
Mrs. Florrick.

21:15.570 --> 21:16.969
Sustained.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.331
Mr. Willoughby,

21:18.370 --> 21:20.907
why didn't you check
box number two?

21:20.940 --> 21:22.430
Well, because it says

21:22.480 --> 21:24.675
"circulatory
disorders/problems."

21:24.710 --> 21:27.577
The doctor said
the heart palpitations

21:27.620 --> 21:29.508
were nothing to worry about.

21:29.550 --> 21:30.448
They weren't a problem.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.446
So, I just thought
I was being accurate.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.379
Thank you.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.627
Let's chalk question two

21:37.660 --> 21:40.493
up to a misunderstanding.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.657
But if someone outright

21:42.700 --> 21:46.522
lied on an application
regarding a relevant

21:46.570 --> 21:48.458
health issue,
that would be grounds

21:48.500 --> 21:49.990
for voiding their
policy, correct?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.462
Yes.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.434
But I didn't.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.937
Question 10.

21:56.980 --> 21:59.608
During the past 12 months,

21:59.650 --> 22:02.369
has any applicant
smoked cigarettes,

22:02.420 --> 22:06.447
pipes, cigars, or used
chewing tobacco?

22:06.490 --> 22:09.550
You answered no, correct?

22:09.590 --> 22:10.522
Correct.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.425
Yes, good.

22:12.460 --> 22:16.556
Now, last fall, did you
go on a fishing trip

22:16.600 --> 22:17.692
with a friend,

22:17.730 --> 22:20.597
with the lovely name
of Brent Boyle?

22:23.910 --> 22:24.934
Objection.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.460
Relevance.
I'm getting there.

22:26.510 --> 22:27.670
Overruled.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.405
The witness may answer
the question.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.443
Yes.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.072
Yes, you did go on
such a fishing trip?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.944
Good.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.412
Here.

22:39.450 --> 22:40.815
Here's you.

22:42.860 --> 22:46.489
And...

22:46.530 --> 22:48.623
Here.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.458
Hmm.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.434
Looks like you're smoking
a cigarette there.

22:56.570 --> 22:59.459
That was... it was only one.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.034
I've never been
a regular smoker.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.708
The question wasn't whether
you were a regular smoker.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.706
Yes, but I didn't think...
Your Honor,

23:05.750 --> 23:07.069
the question was simple.

23:07.110 --> 23:10.045
Mr. Willoughby's answer
was a lie.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.980
(remote control clatters)

23:14.220 --> 23:16.552
Laying aside my sympathy
for the plaintiff,

23:16.590 --> 23:20.185
_what this boils down to is a
Simple matter of contract law.

23:20.230 --> 23:24.462
Mr. Willoughby's material
omission gives Life State

23:24.500 --> 23:28.596
the right to render this
contract null and void.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.529
Plaintiff's motion is denied.
Policy recision stands.

23:31.570 --> 23:33.936
Your Honor, I would ask
for an emergency motion

23:33.980 --> 23:35.004
to reconsider.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.679
Sending Kate Willoughby
home without this surgery

23:37.710 --> 23:39.575
is a death sentence
for her child.

23:39.610 --> 23:41.669
I'm following the law,
Mr. Gardner.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.745
Not agreeing with it.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.746
Motion to reconsider denied.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.557
(sobbing)

23:51.690 --> 23:53.692
Okay, let's make a deal.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.948
You just lost
at craps, Will.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.790
You don't make a deal with the
croupier; you just go home.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.114
WILL:
Well, ifI were you, Patti,
I'd still want to be certain.

24:17.150 --> 24:19.789
Oh, come on.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.927
Right.

24:25.930 --> 24:27.079
Good-bye.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.889
I blew it.

24:34.940 --> 24:38.000
No, Jesse blew it,
and he knows it.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.634
No, Nyholm's right.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.636
I...

24:46.650 --> 24:48.709
I played craps with
that kid's life.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.810
Will, you did everything.

24:51.850 --> 24:54.011
Will, you listen.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.585
I know you did everything.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.179
Are we...?

25:23.220 --> 25:25.586
(sighing)

25:31.160 --> 25:32.286
Damn it.

25:32.330 --> 25:33.524
Alicia...
No, no, no.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.026
Damn it.

25:36.060 --> 25:37.288
(sighs)

25:37.330 --> 25:39.127
God.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.993
(sighing)

25:50.680 --> 25:51.840
(elevator bell dings)

26:04.790 --> 26:06.655
(panﬁng)

26:12.070 --> 26:13.765
(beeping)

26:49.840 --> 26:51.307
Oh, hi.
Just, uh, forgot my laptop.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.830
Good night.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.077
Night.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.859
Alicia.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.027
You just missed her.

27:14.060 --> 27:15.891
Oh, thanks.

27:20.870 --> 27:22.861
(car engine starting)

27:32.950 --> 27:35.976
(cell phone ringing)

27:40.450 --> 27:41.815
(beeps)

27:44.790 --> 27:46.655
(beeps)

27:50.800 --> 27:53.928
(cell phone ringing)

27:53.970 --> 27:55.289
Hello?

27:55.340 --> 27:56.830
MR. WILLOUGHBY:
Mr. Gardner?

27:56.870 --> 27:59.304
Please, we need your help.

27:59.340 --> 28:02.138
(grunting)

28:25.970 --> 28:27.767
(sighs)

28:42.380 --> 28:43.779
Hey.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.187
You all right?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.328
(whispers):
Let's go to the bedroom.

29:03.370 --> 29:04.439
No, here.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.824
We're hoping it's
Braxton Hicks, but
they still won't...

29:30.870 --> 29:33.327
Excuse me... Amanda.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.931
This hospital is required
by law to treat patients

29:36.970 --> 29:38.835
in an emergency, regardless
of insurance coverage.

29:38.870 --> 29:41.930
We are just sorting
out the paperwork, sir.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.004
For an hour?!

29:43.040 --> 29:45.099
If a doctor is
not examining her

29:45.150 --> 29:47.948
within three minutes, I will
personally call the police

29:47.980 --> 29:49.470
and file a malpractice suit
against you.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.988
Personally.

30:04.930 --> 30:05.897
Hi.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.932
Hi.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.937
That was...
great last night.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.071
Are you
becoming religious?

30:24.250 --> 30:25.979
I don't know.

30:26.020 --> 30:28.284
I don't know
what I'm becoming.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.618
But I want to change.
Oh.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.981
No.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.999
No, really... change.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.961
(doorbell rings)

30:41.270 --> 30:44.239
Must be Eli...

30:44.270 --> 30:47.137
so I better change.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.917
Hi.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.978
Um... Will, you,

31:02.020 --> 31:03.009
you can't...

31:03.060 --> 31:05.426
It's not about...
it's about work.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.121
For wor... what?

31:07.160 --> 31:09.526
Your cell phone's off.
I just spent

31:09.560 --> 31:12.199
all night at the hospital
with the Willoughbys.

31:12.230 --> 31:14.630
I need to talk to Peter.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.202
No.

31:21.980 --> 31:23.948
Will?

31:23.980 --> 31:25.379
Hey, Peter.

31:25.410 --> 31:27.048
Been a long time.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.513
A very long time.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.017
Come on in.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.187
Good to see you.

31:34.220 --> 31:36.381
You, too, man.
Yeah.

31:47.370 --> 31:48.667
(timer dings)

31:52.040 --> 31:53.359
WILL:
The surgery's tomorrow.

31:53.410 --> 31:56.573
We've exhausted all
legal channels and...

31:59.110 --> 32:01.169
You didn't have
to do that.

32:03.050 --> 32:04.312
How can I help?

32:04.350 --> 32:06.443
WILL: A company
like Life State

32:06.490 --> 32:10.119
is motivated by
two things-- money

32:10.160 --> 32:13.129
and the fear of
a revoked license.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.096
And I know you and
the commissioner go
back a long way.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.428
Hmm. Give me
something concrete,

32:19.470 --> 32:22.394
and I'll make sure he gets
his eyes on it right away.

32:23.440 --> 32:24.566
Thank you.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.602
So, um...

32:27.640 --> 32:29.301
how's Alicia doing at work?

32:31.210 --> 32:32.507
(chuckles)

32:32.550 --> 32:33.699
(sighs)

32:33.750 --> 32:35.638
Alicia?

32:35.680 --> 32:38.979
Good.

32:39.020 --> 32:41.659
Great, really.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.658
I'm sorry about all
the late hours.

32:45.190 --> 32:46.521
PETER: Oh, hey,
a lawyer's life?

32:46.560 --> 32:48.152
I get it.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.350
Aanay. . .

32:50.400 --> 32:53.198
I hear_the retrial's
gomg well.

32:53.230 --> 32:56.063
Yeah, well, I don't know.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.206
Our state's attorney
seems intent on retrying me,

32:59.240 --> 33:00.502
no matter how thin
the evidence.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.077
Well, at least you're home.

33:03.110 --> 33:04.577
At least I'm home.

33:06.450 --> 33:07.371
So, Alicia,

33:07.410 --> 33:09.412
we need to reconvene
this morning With Kalinda.

33:09.450 --> 33:11.247
Supposedly, she's got
something on Life State.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.484
Oh, what do you know.

33:12.520 --> 33:14.488
Kalinda works
at Stern Lockhart.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.010
Small world.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.152
That's right.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.681
She used to work for you.
Mm-hmm.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.551
So, I'll see you later.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.124
Yup.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.523
Don't be late.

33:31.240 --> 33:34.437
(door opens and closes)

33:34.480 --> 33:36.573
He's great.

33:36.610 --> 33:38.407
I don't_ remember him
being so nice.

33:38.450 --> 33:40.372
Yeah.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.675
Please tell me you
have something good.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.352
Well, I'm not sure what it is.

33:48.390 --> 33:51.826
And my method for obtaining it
is not exactly legitimate.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.829
Illegitimate as in
"I can't use it in court,"

33:54.860 --> 33:58.159
or... we can go to jail?

33:58.200 --> 34:00.122
I downloaded firmware

34:00.170 --> 34:02.434
and cloned Patti Nyholm's phone,

34:02.470 --> 34:04.358
in order to intercept
her text messages.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.799
(chuckles)
What?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.138
You wanted something.
I got you something.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.241
(sighs)

34:14.750 --> 34:16.217
Okay, let's hear it.

34:17.450 --> 34:20.180
Well, apart from an alarming
flirtation with a guy that mows

34:20.220 --> 34:22.256
the lawn,

34:22.290 --> 34:24.224
she's hiding Pamela.

34:24.260 --> 34:25.659
Pamela. Pamela who?

34:25.690 --> 34:28.557
My guess is Pamela Pomeroy,
that claims manager.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.158
I think she's
ready to flip.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.259
She was on the stand.
She didn't say a thing.

34:32.300 --> 34:33.562
Yeah.

34:33.600 --> 34:36.091
"They're on to Pam.
They turn Pam,

34:36.140 --> 34:38.165
we lose everything."
My guess is, Pomeroy

34:38.210 --> 34:40.804
went one too many times to bat
for Life State.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.330
She's ready to spill.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.701
You really cloned Nyholm's cell?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.308
Yeah.

34:48.350 --> 34:49.578
You do that again,
don't tell me.

34:49.620 --> 34:51.247
No problem.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.746
I should talk to her.
(knock at door)

34:52.790 --> 34:54.257
SECRETARY:
Mr. Gardner?
Yeah?

34:54.290 --> 34:56.212
Did Alicia get
her laptop last night?

34:56.260 --> 34:57.488
Alicia?

34:57.520 --> 34:59.488
After you left,
she came back looking

34:59.530 --> 35:00.758
for her laptop in your office.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.326
Just making sure
she got it.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.794
Yeah, yeah, she got it.

35:10.640 --> 35:14.576
Okay, let's go see Pamela.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.475
Yeah.

35:32.190 --> 35:35.489
*

35:46.910 --> 35:48.639
Hi.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.329
I'm sorry about this morning.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.348
You don't have to be sorry.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.642
Can I come in?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.375
Yeah.

36:04.660 --> 36:07.527
So, you're my boss.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.448
I know.

36:12.330 --> 36:13.627
I'm a junior associate.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.638
I know.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.278
You came into my office.

36:24.310 --> 36:27.905
Last night after you
left, you came back
to my office-- why?

36:27.950 --> 36:31.579
Will... help me out, please?

36:31.620 --> 36:33.941
I mean, we had...

36:33.990 --> 36:36.311
We had...

36:36.360 --> 36:39.488
whatever we had at Georgetown,
and I just...

36:39.530 --> 36:41.418
But you came back.

36:42.530 --> 36:44.293
I know.

36:44.330 --> 36:45.467
It was wrong.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.291
Because you're married?

36:54.540 --> 36:56.337
Okay, I have a suggestion.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.371
I like work.

36:58.410 --> 36:59.809
I like working here.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.743
I don't want
everywhere I go to be a mess.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.442
We're not going to talk
about this.

37:06.490 --> 37:08.412
We're not going
to say any more, okay?

37:09.790 --> 37:11.382
Good.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.852
We're going to go to dinner

37:12.890 --> 37:15.529
in one week's time,
and we'll talk then.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.291
Please don't end up hating me.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.763
I need this job.
I mean, I'm...

37:23.800 --> 37:25.506
H, I mean that...

37:25.540 --> 37:28.429
I'm sorry...
Alicia.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.869
It's fine.

37:33.980 --> 37:35.971
We have bad timing.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.787
(sighs)

37:41.820 --> 37:45.278
We've always had bad timing.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.570
KALINDA:
Excuse me, Ms. Pomeroy?

38:03.410 --> 38:05.401
Oh, you're, uh...
Yes.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.542
Do you have a moment,
Ms. Pomeroy?

38:06.580 --> 38:07.808
I-I don't think
we should be talking.

38:07.850 --> 38:08.874
We just need a minute.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.388
Why are they trying to hide you?

38:11.420 --> 38:14.014
I-I have no idea what you're
talking about.

38:14.050 --> 38:15.756
Uh, I have to go.
Please!

38:15.790 --> 38:17.519
The Willoughbys...

38:17.560 --> 38:19.755
their child is dying.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.054
I saw it in your eyes.
You want to help.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.397
Please help.

38:23.430 --> 38:24.988
You saw it in my eyes?

38:25.030 --> 38:26.463
Really?

38:26.500 --> 38:28.058
What powers of perception.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.830
What do you see in my eyes now?

38:30.870 --> 38:32.667
I'm going home now.

38:32.710 --> 38:36.032
But... Nyholm said she
was trying to hide Pam.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.942
You guys are really clueless.

38:39.980 --> 38:41.618
She's not trying to hide it.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.641
It's closed already.

38:46.450 --> 38:48.088
"It"?

38:48.120 --> 38:49.451
WILL:
It's an acronym.

38:49.490 --> 38:53.529
PAM-- policy
application management.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.027
It's an off-site group

38:55.060 --> 38:58.052
of Life State employees who look
for application mistakes,

38:58.100 --> 39:00.398
but only after expensive
claims were filed.

39:00.430 --> 39:02.569
It's organized
post-claims underwriting.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.067
Yup. It's illegal
in some states,

39:04.100 --> 39:05.499
and legislation in Illinois

39:05.540 --> 39:06.768
is on the horizon.
Which explains why

39:06.810 --> 39:08.437
they shut it
and tried to bury it.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.630
Yeah, but we got it
with an illegally-obtained text.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.898
It's fruit of the poisonous
tree. We can't use it.

39:12.950 --> 39:15.510
We can use it.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.871
We just can't use it in court.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.127
(knocking)

39:27.160 --> 39:29.128
Not a good time.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.627
Sure, it is.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.799
(mechanical humming)
Suit yourself.

39:37.540 --> 39:39.531
Is that...?
Yeah.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.149
This case is over, Will.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.512
No.

39:48.550 --> 39:51.587
Life State is going to quietly
reinstate Kate's coverage

39:51.620 --> 39:54.043
in time for the surgery
this afternoon...

39:54.090 --> 39:55.910
or your client's
going to be dealing

39:55.960 --> 39:58.656
with a hell of a lot more
than one upset family.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.885
Here I go trembling again.

40:00.930 --> 40:03.194
We know about PAM.

40:03.230 --> 40:04.663
(humming stops)

40:06.500 --> 40:09.765
And do you know who's
sitting outside your
office right now?

40:09.800 --> 40:12.507
Jonathan Dobbs, the
insurance commissioner.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.872
(sighs)

40:14.910 --> 40:16.605
(Bluetooth beeps)
Tammy?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.699
_ Is ther_e_a man
in the waiting room?

40:20.010 --> 40:22.149
Describe him.

40:29.690 --> 40:31.487
(Bluetooth beeps off)

40:31.530 --> 40:33.020
How'd you do that?

40:33.060 --> 40:35.654
He's waiting to hear about PAM.

40:35.700 --> 40:39.124
An entire department dedicated
to finding specious ways

40:39.170 --> 40:41.832
to rescind policies
when patients need them most.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.969
Do you remember
when you asked me

40:45.010 --> 40:47.934
_how bad I can make an
insurance company look?

40:47.970 --> 40:50.177
Really bad, Patti.

40:50.210 --> 40:52.144
Drop your license bad.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.512
You got this illegally.

40:54.550 --> 40:56.518
You must have,
or we'd be in court.

40:56.550 --> 40:59.018
You want to take it to a judge
and sort it out there,

40:59.050 --> 41:00.039
or just cover Kate?

41:04.530 --> 41:06.521
Thank you.

41:07.530 --> 41:10.226
I, um... Ifailed her.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.898
Just one puff
of a cigarette,

41:11.930 --> 41:13.591
and I saw it
all going wrong.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.059
You have kids?

41:17.100 --> 41:19.102
No.

41:20.170 --> 41:21.831
I think it changes everything.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.029
Doesn't it?

41:24.610 --> 41:26.248
It does.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.949
Is he...? I can't tell if
he's smiling. Is he smiling?

41:37.990 --> 41:40.026
WILL:
I don't know.

41:40.060 --> 41:41.652
Take off your mask.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.729
You realize if one whiff
of PAM surfaces,

41:53.770 --> 41:55.704
we can trace back to your firm?

41:55.740 --> 41:58.038
I know what a confidentiality
agreement is, Patti.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.105
And you can't use it
in the class action suit.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.617
We'll find another way.

42:01.650 --> 42:03.641
I doubt that.

42:05.120 --> 42:07.088
How'd you find it?
Find what?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.951
PAM.

42:08.990 --> 42:10.617
Who's Pam?

42:13.130 --> 42:15.758
You two make a cute couple.

42:28.310 --> 42:29.868
Hey.

42:29.910 --> 42:31.798
How'd it go?

42:31.850 --> 42:34.068
The insurance guys?
Jonathan showed up, right?

42:34.110 --> 42:36.044
Oh, right. Yeah, he did.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.069
It worked.

42:37.120 --> 42:39.315
Our client got the surgery,
and it went well.

42:39.350 --> 42:41.215
All right...

42:42.690 --> 42:44.954
How was your day?
Good.

42:44.990 --> 42:49.825
I spent more time
with Pastor Isaiah.

42:54.270 --> 42:55.965
He wants us to go to church.

43:00.010 --> 43:02.638
Well, that would
be interesting.

43:10.780 --> 43:12.782
It's getting late.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.197
Good night, Peter.
