01:45.972 --> 01:47.774
That's impossible.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.925
That's impossible.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.259
This is gonna hurt.

02:16.820 --> 02:20.941
Just finish me!
What are you waiting for?

02:21.041 --> 02:23.245
The moment of clarity.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.884
Sin.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.138
Between the prey...

02:35.284 --> 02:37.226
and the hunter.

02:42.395 --> 02:44.399
Wolfsbane.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.638
A powerful agent of affliction.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.178
To those of weaker status.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.426
But you know this, don't you, Vasha?

03:15.962 --> 03:17.799
Please.

03:18.798 --> 03:21.236
Please spare my family.

03:25.342 --> 03:28.410
But we are your family now.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.975
And I assure you,

03:31.075 --> 03:33.874
no harm will come to us.

03:38.212 --> 03:40.353
I don't know where she is.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.399
I know.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.509
I know.

03:52.965 --> 03:56.479
Your death shall light the fire.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.150
Go to hell!

06:35.895 --> 06:40.200
Chase, what are you doing out here, bro,
it's major patty fest inside.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.669
Mark, you gotta stop doing that.

06:42.769 --> 06:48.051
Dude, it's a Lambda Omega Lambda party,
and you're out here doodling?

06:50.076 --> 06:53.263
Listen, I know you got back
in town and stuff, but...

06:53.363 --> 06:56.960
you really need to know the things
they're calling us around school.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.264
One two three foreskin,

07:02.054 --> 07:04.032
butt buddies,

07:04.132 --> 07:09.329
and my personal favorite...
two pricks for sure-a.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.376
Listen, if you don't go
inside there right now,

07:13.566 --> 07:15.802
you might as well kill me because...

07:15.902 --> 07:18.905
what you're doing right now,
as your roommate,

07:19.005 --> 07:22.375
you're committing social murder, okay?

07:22.475 --> 07:25.505
You... you're a murderer.

07:29.005 --> 07:30.622
Butt buddies.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.731
Kinda dumb if you ask me.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.956
God, after all I just said...

07:37.056 --> 07:40.070
Listen, it's literally the temple
of poon inside there

07:40.170 --> 07:42.911
and you're out here talking to yourself.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.241
Noted.

07:48.462 --> 07:50.913
What were you looking at anyway?

07:52.805 --> 07:54.207
When?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.079
When I came outside to talk to you,

07:56.179 --> 07:59.260
you looked like
a brain dead mule or something.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.317
I... gotta go.

08:04.417 --> 08:07.920
Man, don't do this to me, man.
Not right now, come on.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.077
At least grab a titty or something!

09:03.856 --> 09:05.511
What?

09:05.611 --> 09:08.191
Same feeling as before.

09:08.314 --> 09:11.060
Why can't I control it?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.030
What's happening to me?

09:32.672 --> 09:37.487
To lure its prey, to take its place.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.642
That was its final request.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.229
What do these last words mean?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.595
That last quote...

09:51.098 --> 09:53.512
from Le Wolf.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.097
What does it mean? Anybody?

09:57.697 --> 10:00.801
Maybe he felt that in order to survive,

10:00.901 --> 10:03.607
it must sacrifice itself to live.

10:03.707 --> 10:06.849
But it's stronger than the prey.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.354
I think it's a metaphor.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.082
How so, Chase?

10:16.182 --> 10:18.685
If you know anything about lycanthropy,

10:18.785 --> 10:22.075
then you know that being able
to transform into a wolf

10:22.175 --> 10:27.460
doesn't automatically...
induce the terminology werewolf.

10:27.560 --> 10:33.456
In fact, the creature described
in the story, walking on two legs,

10:33.556 --> 10:36.102
is more of that of a lycan.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.447
Expand, Chase.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.590
I think in many ways
the Lycan is the prey.

10:44.690 --> 10:48.524
Very good. Good, Chase.

10:49.015 --> 10:54.997
The Lycan, as you call it,
is vulnerable.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.443
It's fragile in its vulnerability
and it became clear

11:00.543 --> 11:03.496
that to truly understand
this vulnerability,

11:03.596 --> 11:06.609
it must allow itself to be the prey.

11:08.434 --> 11:12.448
It needed the prey to save it
from what it was meant to be.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.475
What an interesting young man here.

11:16.575 --> 11:20.113
In the over 2,000 year history
of this story,

11:20.213 --> 11:24.611
no one has ever gotten
the metaphor correct.

11:45.838 --> 11:48.140
I think I heard something.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.152
Really?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.992
No, I'm serious.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.861
I think I heard something.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.105
I guess I'll go check it out.

12:20.039 --> 12:22.675
Hey, are any scary
creepy things out here?

12:22.775 --> 12:25.789
- James!
- All right, all right.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.197
Are there any wild animals out here?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.108
Hey!

12:49.101 --> 12:51.437
No! Hey, no!

12:51.537 --> 12:53.382
James!

12:58.844 --> 13:00.556
James?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.395
James, this isn't funny.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.650
Chaz, what the hell?

13:28.874 --> 13:30.320
Where's James?

13:32.444 --> 13:35.380
You mean the wolfman?

13:46.792 --> 13:49.138
Yeah, get that shit, bro.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.931
Oh, someone help me,

13:53.031 --> 13:56.635
I've been taken advantage of
by the big bad wolfman.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.904
You like 'em cheap.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.207
Scary enough for her.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.444
I think it got me more hot
than one man can handle.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.756
Hear that, Chaz?

14:08.347 --> 14:09.876
Yeah, I heard her.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.795
What are you waiting for?

14:31.737 --> 14:33.783
Oh, my God!

15:05.938 --> 15:08.350
You should be a bit more careful.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.577
Are you out of your mind?

15:11.677 --> 15:15.443
Stay in tonight.
You never know who's watching.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.189
Let me help.

15:23.289 --> 15:26.168
Oh, thanks, I think I got it.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.941
You're Amy, right?

15:32.431 --> 15:37.136
Yes. We have Literature together,
I sit three rows down from you.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.205
I sit three rows down from you?

15:39.305 --> 15:42.785
Stalk much, Amy?
Way to come off like a weirdo.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.428
I noticed you weren't in class today.

15:46.128 --> 15:48.364
Are you busy working on your end
of the year assignment?

15:48.714 --> 15:53.652
Oh, yeah, actually, I was thinking
about working on that later.

15:53.752 --> 15:56.822
Nice save, Amy, you're back in the game!

15:56.922 --> 16:00.482
Well, if you're not busy
later on tonight,

16:00.582 --> 16:03.145
there's this really cool
underground rave.

16:03.495 --> 16:08.801
It's not too far away from Lankley
and a lot of the surrounding counties...

16:08.901 --> 16:11.770
you know, people
from all over sort of...

16:11.870 --> 16:16.709
get together and it's...
it's really different.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.922
Thanks, I'll check that out.

16:22.481 --> 16:28.220
Oh, and there's this historic bridge
past the old Willows off 27.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.689
You know, for... for your project.

16:32.016 --> 16:35.570
- Thanks, I might check that out.
- There you go.

16:36.295 --> 16:39.343
I'm sorry, did you say something?

16:39.443 --> 16:41.497
No, just...

16:42.101 --> 16:43.946
See you tonight.

16:47.097 --> 16:48.951
Strange.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.892
I wonder what happened
in the woods that night.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.372
What could do that to human flesh?

17:39.425 --> 17:41.971
Is it the same girl as before?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.380
Don't turn around.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.107
Hey, sorry, I was just...

17:54.207 --> 17:57.019
I... what do you want?

17:57.376 --> 17:59.222
I just...

18:02.414 --> 18:04.793
Look down, don't look at me.

18:10.856 --> 18:12.902
You're not like them.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.679
What the hell was that about?

18:52.797 --> 18:55.277
Hey, Chase, where are you, man?

19:05.861 --> 19:08.981
He doesn't seem to get it.
He's gonna get himself killed.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.550
Hey, wait a second.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.363
Why'd you pull me away from my friends?

19:14.987 --> 19:18.133
You have no idea
when to be quiet, do you?

19:21.660 --> 19:23.395
What's your name?

19:23.495 --> 19:25.464
As in...

19:25.564 --> 19:27.210
Who the hell are you?

19:28.066 --> 19:30.102
There it is again.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.440
Your inability to not speak.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.291
Are you gonna walk me home or what?

19:48.754 --> 19:50.422
I'm Chase.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.368
Seriously?

19:53.659 --> 19:55.671
I'm Le Dawn.

19:56.528 --> 20:02.701
Wait, do you mean just Dawn
because Le Dawn seems a bit strange.

20:02.801 --> 20:06.515
Okay, so call me what you want then
since Chase is so much better.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.452
No, I was just saying
maybe I didn't hear you correctly.

20:11.476 --> 20:15.224
Look, Dawn's the only name
I can hear in my head, okay?

20:15.447 --> 20:17.326
Okay.

20:18.450 --> 20:21.364
Dawn... it's nice to meet you.

20:22.454 --> 20:26.453
Now do you mind telling me
why you pulled me out of that party?

20:27.876 --> 20:31.021
Because I needed someone
to walk me home.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.939
Yeah, well, I don't get
a lot of company.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.287
Dawn...

20:49.948 --> 20:53.295
I seriously need to learn
how to turn my head faster.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.836
I like your outfit.
I heard you guys were werewolves.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.986
- What is Gecko thinking?
- Ladies...

21:06.051 --> 21:10.706
Sin... is a man of few words.

21:16.241 --> 21:19.154
So how come I haven't seen you
around campus?

21:20.545 --> 21:23.515
They don't normally
let me out of my cage.

21:23.615 --> 21:25.951
Well, I think you're the most
beautiful girl on campus.

21:26.051 --> 21:29.454
Are you wearing beer goggles?
She is the most beautiful girl on campus.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.835
- Don't you have something better to do?
- Don't you have a curfew?

21:34.759 --> 21:37.673
Gecko, make yourself useful.

21:38.930 --> 21:41.999
Oh, forever the parent, Kaio?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.996
Kaio, Gecko...

21:46.896 --> 21:50.032
let's not play with our food.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.462
Well, this should be fun.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.755
Was I dreaming of you?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.891
You can't be real.

22:35.203 --> 22:37.449
Why are you following me?

22:40.859 --> 22:45.024
If I turn around...
will you still be there?

22:46.298 --> 22:48.944
That depends entirely on you.

22:56.675 --> 22:58.387
What are you running from?

23:00.712 --> 23:03.425
Same thing as you it seems.

23:04.015 --> 23:06.919
Careful, it could cut you.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.298
Then what will you do?

23:10.822 --> 23:14.267
What will you do?

23:22.884 --> 23:26.132
I can see everything
you're hearing right now.

23:28.473 --> 23:31.086
You'll never speak freely again.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.424
What is this? Is this of her creation?

23:53.524 --> 23:55.309
A dream?

23:55.884 --> 23:57.696
The nightmare.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.243
Wake up!

24:28.633 --> 24:30.635
Chase, wake up!

24:30.735 --> 24:32.614
Chase...

24:33.171 --> 24:35.483
- Are you with us?
- Are you with us?

24:40.879 --> 24:45.794
I hope you're finding your assignments to be
challenging and intellectually stimulating.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.370
What the hell?

25:01.266 --> 25:04.318
- Sorry, sorry.
- Chase...

25:22.053 --> 25:24.432
What the fuck are you looking at?

25:25.290 --> 25:27.302
Freak.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.311
I...

25:36.902 --> 25:39.181
I think I have to be...

25:46.778 --> 25:48.900
Don't even think about it.

26:26.718 --> 26:29.775
Chase, I need you to stand up.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.445
What's happening to me?

26:44.335 --> 26:48.750
We don't have much time for this. You need
to come with me before it's too late.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.078
No.

26:51.178 --> 26:54.887
I'm done following strange people.

26:54.987 --> 26:58.760
I am Danse, we have Literature together.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.263
Okay.

27:02.087 --> 27:04.333
Why are you...

27:05.457 --> 27:07.469
Are you real?

27:10.028 --> 27:13.375
Gather yourself! Follow me!

27:14.632 --> 27:18.716
There's someone I need you to meet
if we are to save your life.

27:44.429 --> 27:47.176
Don't you move, or I'll end you.

27:49.901 --> 27:52.114
It's one of yours, I assume.

27:53.404 --> 27:55.807
Chase, meet my father, Henrick.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.876
How you doing, boy?

27:57.976 --> 28:02.050
You gotta stop bringing home these
arty guys, they're nothing but trouble.

28:02.150 --> 28:08.096
A man's quarrel stems from his inability
to recognize his own shortcomings.

28:09.154 --> 28:15.207
Okay, when the measuring contest is over,
the grownups are gonna be in the house.

28:30.441 --> 28:32.654
A drink for the lady?

28:37.982 --> 28:39.385
In case you were wondering,

28:39.485 --> 28:42.997
A Nightmare Before Christmas,
I was referring to you.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.924
Henrick, it's time.

28:46.024 --> 28:48.503
Oh, come on, I was just teasing.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.966
What the hell happened
to all the fun in the world?

28:55.066 --> 28:57.602
The world realized
how crazy it truly was.

28:59.051 --> 29:03.752
See? Brains and looks.
She is a good stall.

29:11.282 --> 29:13.628
The red moon is approaching.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.223
You know the trick to really good hooch?

29:18.323 --> 29:22.323
Is keep what they call the four shot,
you know what that is? Of course you don't.

29:22.423 --> 29:26.590
You don't know what I'm saying 'cause you
guys ain't that bright. Back in the day...

29:26.690 --> 29:30.311
they was making this stuff
on the mills and out in the coal mines,

29:30.411 --> 29:34.775
they was using radiator fluid and methanol
and antifreeze, I mean...

29:35.175 --> 29:37.526
that stuff will take the edge off.

29:38.243 --> 29:40.847
Yeah, boy, and during the war,

29:40.947 --> 29:43.949
you know, the boys discovered
that if you take the four shot

29:44.049 --> 29:47.853
or the first few ounce of alcohol
that drip from the condenser,

29:47.953 --> 29:51.590
you went from 50 proof to 300 proof

29:51.690 --> 29:54.193
to 500 proof, and let me tell you...

29:54.293 --> 29:57.162
a bullet to the head wouldn't come
a knocking till half past boat man's

29:57.262 --> 29:59.474
if you know what I'm saying.

30:00.098 --> 30:02.510
The Vietnam War?

30:08.206 --> 30:11.286
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

30:12.477 --> 30:15.079
Chang ching Chong mi!

30:15.179 --> 30:17.482
The American war.

30:17.582 --> 30:19.361
The American...

30:23.021 --> 30:25.266
You see, the problem...

30:25.890 --> 30:29.595
With trying to stop the ferment
of the sugar in the brew from hardening,

30:29.695 --> 30:32.831
is you can never really get
the damn thing under control.

30:32.931 --> 30:36.902
It never acts the way you want it to,
so the recipe, no not the recipe,

30:37.002 --> 30:40.605
the secret is to not try and control it.

30:40.705 --> 30:43.975
Better stay very still till it's ready.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.087
Then boom!

30:49.881 --> 30:51.950
Then you're silent.

30:52.050 --> 30:55.587
Neither one of you
will see it till it's too late

30:55.687 --> 30:57.960
and before you know it,

30:58.360 --> 31:00.596
you're watching your friends
on all sides,

31:00.696 --> 31:04.512
the BPA, the NFA, and the Vietcongs,

31:04.612 --> 31:07.677
it all becomes the same.

31:15.773 --> 31:17.642
Yeah.

31:17.942 --> 31:20.675
Just one big brew...

31:20.775 --> 31:23.018
of white lightning.

31:37.495 --> 31:40.198
Sometimes you gotta spit it out
'cause it's...

31:40.298 --> 31:45.436
'Cause... 'cause it's too hot,
if you know what I'm saying.

31:45.536 --> 31:48.984
But by then, the taste is already
in your mouth, you know,

31:49.084 --> 31:52.419
and it just sits there
and it ferments blue,

31:52.519 --> 31:55.486
it ferments yellower than hell.

31:58.116 --> 32:01.152
All I really remember
about it is red eyes.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.622
Red eyes right through me, laser like,

32:03.722 --> 32:07.168
I mean, pow, red eyes, man!

32:07.659 --> 32:09.460
Right at me!

32:09.560 --> 32:11.406
Yeah, boy.

33:24.368 --> 33:27.048
Changed everything.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.153
Changed everything.

33:33.911 --> 33:35.780
Werewolves?

33:35.880 --> 33:38.783
Sorry, Vietnamese werewolves?

33:38.883 --> 33:41.052
Naturally, my good boy.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.371
I see I have two options.

33:43.471 --> 33:49.060
One, I stay and you pull me into
this fantasy world that doesn't exist,

33:49.160 --> 33:53.286
or two, and by far the surest
of my two options...

33:53.386 --> 33:58.904
is I walk out that door and continue
to live a life of clear and precise rules.

33:59.004 --> 34:01.939
Or you can shut up and listen.

34:02.039 --> 34:04.352
Because we're only gonna do this once.

34:11.114 --> 34:15.119
Oh, man. Let me tell you
something about your options.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.632
They don't mean squat.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.792
Follow me or go home.

34:21.891 --> 34:25.172
Either way, we need to prepare.

34:49.603 --> 34:53.024
Kill him. Kill him
before he fully changes.

34:53.123 --> 34:55.458
All those options you had, hoss?

34:55.559 --> 34:58.062
Ain't worth the tea in a china shop.

34:58.162 --> 34:59.741
Kill him.

35:16.847 --> 35:19.984
- Kill him.
- This is your enemy.

35:20.084 --> 35:23.251
Don't let your mind create
sympathy for a beast.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.466
An animal.

35:25.823 --> 35:27.732
- Kill him.
- Don't let that animal surface.

35:27.832 --> 35:29.652
Kill him.

36:10.401 --> 36:12.631
This is the last...
they're gonna attend.

36:38.362 --> 36:41.576
Allow me to introduce myself.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.349
And save you the paperwork.

37:46.363 --> 37:47.708
Was it fun?

37:50.501 --> 37:55.606
I painted the fucking Mona Lisa.

37:55.706 --> 38:01.055
Stay focused. Sin wants this
to play out according to plan.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.896
Well, look at them.

38:09.487 --> 38:11.766
They don't know what to do.

38:14.992 --> 38:17.872
Clean up after yourself, will ya?

38:45.489 --> 38:47.168
What is your problem?

38:50.828 --> 38:53.240
I could ask you the same.

38:53.597 --> 38:56.143
I'm convinced you don't have a brain.

39:04.274 --> 39:07.712
You don't fully understand
if you're not careful.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.424
Or in your case not stupid.

39:11.348 --> 39:14.506
I don't think you fully understand that.

39:14.606 --> 39:17.131
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.134
Could he really be telling the truth?

39:21.525 --> 39:24.356
I saw a glimpse.

39:25.930 --> 39:28.456
Did you ever catch a glimpse
of something that...

39:28.556 --> 39:32.774
you didn't understand, but...
you knew somehow...

39:32.874 --> 39:35.082
it was gonna be life changing?

39:36.574 --> 39:40.510
You are really messed up, aren't you?

39:40.610 --> 39:45.226
I mean, you look like you have it
all together, but you clearly don't.

39:47.918 --> 39:51.555
I can still see what you're hearing
which means you're not full.

39:51.655 --> 39:54.468
This bitch is truly crazy.

39:59.229 --> 40:01.632
What do you want from me?

40:01.732 --> 40:06.247
I mean, what are you really doing here?

40:07.905 --> 40:10.384
Let's go get some fresh air.

40:14.768 --> 40:16.490
This is so good.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.052
What?

40:22.152 --> 40:24.522
Nothing, it's just...

40:24.622 --> 40:27.175
It's just not what I expected
when you said fresh air.

40:28.993 --> 40:32.432
Okay, so you wanted me to act all crazy?

40:41.639 --> 40:43.118
What are you looking at?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.415
Dude, I'm totally kidding!

41:12.603 --> 41:14.405
Have you ever mind surfed?

41:14.805 --> 41:18.413
No, I can't say that I have.

41:20.911 --> 41:22.613
Okay.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.307
I'll show you something crazy.

41:31.956 --> 41:34.616
What have I gotten myself into?

41:36.560 --> 41:39.930
- What did you do?
- Shut up and buckle your seatbelt.

41:40.030 --> 41:43.277
- But why, it's...
- Just give it a minute.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.086
Close your eyes.

42:02.486 --> 42:06.190
And think about anyplace
in the world you wanna travel to.

42:06.290 --> 42:11.038
It can be an idea, a place, a dream.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.257
Got it?

42:14.431 --> 42:17.294
Okay, now hold that image in your mind.

43:17.895 --> 43:19.674
Am I really here?

43:23.334 --> 43:25.582
Did she do this, or...

43:28.005 --> 43:33.800
How can we be in one place,
the same place, if it's a fantasy?

43:45.856 --> 43:48.168
Is this for real?

43:48.525 --> 43:50.871
Isn't this real?

43:51.061 --> 43:53.073
This place.

43:53.497 --> 43:56.710
Isn't this more real
than anything else out there?

43:59.703 --> 44:02.917
This place is impossible.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.982
Sure doesn't seem that way sometimes.

44:07.945 --> 44:10.666
It's the only place I can think.

44:11.515 --> 44:15.079
Why can't you stay here
all the time? I mean...

44:15.894 --> 44:18.656
Why go back if the noise
bothers you so much?

44:18.756 --> 44:20.358
Because...

44:20.858 --> 44:23.393
Does he truly not see?

44:23.493 --> 44:26.707
Could he be this dumb,
or is he really different?

44:28.665 --> 44:32.832
Because I can't keep chasing
a shadow, Chase.

44:33.503 --> 44:35.672
I'm only here for this.

44:35.772 --> 44:37.584
The now.

44:39.443 --> 44:41.722
What are you running from?

44:43.247 --> 44:45.659
What aren't you telling me?

45:00.464 --> 45:05.045
You do not have to follow me.
I'm highly capable of being by myself.

45:05.936 --> 45:09.984
Yeah, but you won't be as capable
when the red moon arrives.

45:11.008 --> 45:13.260
So what do you wanna do?

45:13.360 --> 45:16.807
You wanna be happy
like your little girlfriend over there?

45:17.014 --> 45:19.764
You can end all of your troubles.

45:22.286 --> 45:25.700
I think I know someone
that can help you, but...

45:27.457 --> 45:29.470
You have to trust me.

46:03.894 --> 46:06.181
I almost feel sorry for them.

46:07.097 --> 46:09.343
They are a destructive breed.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.280
Save your empathy, Kaio.

46:14.504 --> 46:16.284
What are you afraid of?

46:18.208 --> 46:20.287
You like to party?

46:22.679 --> 46:24.892
You like to have fun?

46:25.916 --> 46:27.951
Well, we're gonna have a lot of fun.

46:28.051 --> 46:30.064
What do you want with me?

46:31.822 --> 46:33.834
Let me go!

46:37.290 --> 46:39.746
We just wanna have a good time!

46:40.897 --> 46:42.304
Grab hold.

46:44.134 --> 46:46.146
It's showtime.

46:54.211 --> 46:58.591
Hold on to me and don't let go
no matter what.

46:59.182 --> 47:02.763
Try not to fight it... when it comes.

47:08.091 --> 47:09.703
Rage.

48:09.152 --> 48:13.765
Take a good look.

48:14.658 --> 48:17.204
All around you.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.641
This is your future.

48:30.240 --> 48:37.054
Tell everyone you know
how much fun you had here today.

48:37.781 --> 48:40.825
And that we intend
on having even more fun

48:40.925 --> 48:44.531
next time with more familiar guests.

48:53.130 --> 48:56.266
I don't think this is one
of your better ideas.

48:56.366 --> 49:00.064
We don't have a choice. Besides that...

49:00.164 --> 49:03.417
I think he knows more
than he was leading us to believe.

49:10.814 --> 49:13.625
All right,
that's far enough here, Chief.

49:16.820 --> 49:19.015
Henrick...

49:19.115 --> 49:21.636
she's changing.

49:21.736 --> 49:23.937
We need your help.

49:24.528 --> 49:26.396
Why didn't you say so?

49:26.496 --> 49:29.709
Now that makes everything
all square then, now don't it?

49:30.567 --> 49:32.946
You and that thing...

49:33.603 --> 49:35.649
can't be here.

49:37.207 --> 49:40.588
- I know you know what's going on.
- There's no time.

49:42.012 --> 49:45.644
Sir, I don't know you...

49:46.090 --> 49:51.164
but in a mere matter of days, I'm not
gonna be able to control my thirst to kill.

49:53.790 --> 49:56.338
We just wanna make sure
you understand that one of the people

49:56.438 --> 50:00.026
I could potentially rip into pieces
while eating their fucking insides

50:00.126 --> 50:03.210
and crushing their bones one by one...

50:04.551 --> 50:06.673
may very well be your daughter.

50:09.973 --> 50:12.765
So you can either shoot me now,

50:12.865 --> 50:15.555
or I'll be seeing you very soon.

50:16.079 --> 50:19.030
I fear in a not very pleasant affair.

50:20.583 --> 50:24.206
Or you can tell us what you know.

50:29.793 --> 50:32.539
I can tell you what I know.

50:34.097 --> 50:39.547
Can the both of you please follow me
politely into the woods?

50:50.313 --> 50:53.325
Now you gotta trust all your senses
'cause the ones chasing you

50:53.425 --> 50:55.785
ain't no ordinary pack of wolves.

50:55.885 --> 50:58.388
Come here, my little fire starter.

50:58.488 --> 51:00.724
Now close your eyes.

51:01.124 --> 51:03.136
What do you see?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.973
I s... I see...

51:07.697 --> 51:11.362
Okay, if you see anything... but black,

51:11.462 --> 51:15.669
let me know your secret 'cause them eyes
ain't got no curtains, you know what I mean?

51:15.769 --> 51:18.051
All right, close your eyes.

51:18.347 --> 51:19.746
They closed?

51:19.846 --> 51:22.504
Now walk forward.

51:23.046 --> 51:26.860
Slow, be calm.

51:27.415 --> 51:29.429
Everything is good.

51:30.679 --> 51:32.555
Hear it.

51:32.655 --> 51:34.968
Feel your surroundings.

52:12.162 --> 52:14.563
That was, that...

52:29.145 --> 52:31.466
That was far out.

52:35.518 --> 52:39.522
Each member of this rogue wolf pack
is a master of vulnerabilities,

52:39.622 --> 52:41.759
so no matter what you learn here today,

52:41.859 --> 52:43.603
no matter...

52:45.662 --> 52:47.907
Lesson over.

52:49.465 --> 52:51.846
- Sorry.
- Dawn...

52:52.718 --> 52:57.808
Man. Listen, kid, when your girlfriend
is an unstoppable killing machine...

52:58.308 --> 53:00.777
give her all the space she needs.

53:00.877 --> 53:03.189
Scared the hell outta me.

53:08.368 --> 53:09.580
Henrick.

53:26.311 --> 53:28.274
Henrick.

53:33.777 --> 53:35.822
Henrick...

53:35.922 --> 53:42.489
we grow tired of waiting,
and Sin's patience has worn thin.

53:42.589 --> 53:47.201
Maybe you're not grasping
the importance of the order of things.

53:47.957 --> 53:52.739
We bring you lab rats
and you give us what we need.

53:54.063 --> 53:57.710
There's no room for personal feelings.

53:58.768 --> 54:04.174
Like I told your traveling freak show
before, I'm moving as fast as I can, slick.

54:04.274 --> 54:08.788
And you tell Sin
I will not be intimidated.

54:11.014 --> 54:14.299
If fear is the catalyst you seek,

54:14.399 --> 54:17.831
then allow me to oblige.

54:22.559 --> 54:27.761
You think this is about
the destruction of our species?

54:31.117 --> 54:33.714
This is about the survival...

54:33.814 --> 54:35.919
of mankind.

54:40.476 --> 54:42.188
Kaio!

54:48.952 --> 54:51.655
Kaio has a very special ability.

54:51.955 --> 54:57.676
They say that her pack travel in swarms
devouring everything in their path.

54:57.776 --> 55:01.264
They bonded, one to another.

55:01.364 --> 55:03.634
Each fiber of their being

55:03.734 --> 55:08.348
using their connection to control
the elements, the life force.

55:09.205 --> 55:12.831
One body, one soul.

55:37.000 --> 55:40.337
The girl... the girl's here.

55:40.937 --> 55:44.240
I can feel her presence.
There's something else.

55:44.340 --> 55:48.671
An element I've never felt before.

55:48.771 --> 55:50.657
Something...

55:52.148 --> 55:53.993
powerful.

56:01.624 --> 56:03.403
Finish it.

56:22.979 --> 56:26.866
This can't be the same place, can it?

56:27.917 --> 56:29.729
Dawn?

56:31.087 --> 56:33.099
Go away.

56:34.191 --> 56:38.872
This is just a dream, Dawn.

56:44.667 --> 56:47.146
What do you want, Chase?

56:52.875 --> 56:54.954
I just want...

56:56.379 --> 56:58.625
to be honest...

57:00.049 --> 57:02.162
I don't know what I want.

57:03.052 --> 57:06.923
This shit... it's all crazy.

57:07.023 --> 57:11.604
You're weird, and I'm weird.

57:13.129 --> 57:16.658
You're a killer, a wolf...

57:17.788 --> 57:19.780
a fairy?

57:20.670 --> 57:22.729
I don't know...

57:22.829 --> 57:25.559
but it scares the hell out of me.

57:28.911 --> 57:30.528
Yet...

57:31.926 --> 57:33.864
here I am.

57:36.085 --> 57:41.167
So maybe I have some things
I have to sort out, deal with.

57:42.658 --> 57:45.060
Or maybe I just need you.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.533
I'm only here for this moment, Chase.

57:50.233 --> 57:51.778
I'm not real.

57:53.169 --> 57:55.548
You seem real to me.

58:02.712 --> 58:06.549
You have so much in you
and you can't see.

58:06.649 --> 58:09.185
It's driving you crazy.

58:09.285 --> 58:12.665
Literally... insane.

58:14.707 --> 58:17.436
I don't know what to do.

58:21.714 --> 58:24.427
There's nothing for you to do.

58:24.934 --> 58:28.414
Why do you people always feel
like you have to do something?

58:28.571 --> 58:32.108
This world isn't for you
to understand, nor am I.

58:32.208 --> 58:34.871
All you need to understand is
that when the red moon comes,

58:34.971 --> 58:38.681
I'm not gonna be this shell that you see,
I'm gonna be who I really am.

58:38.781 --> 58:41.394
My true self, Chase.

58:45.888 --> 58:49.602
You can spend your whole life
chasing shadows.

58:50.393 --> 58:53.506
Something you'll never fully comprehend.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.314
I have people after me,
people who wanna see me bleed.

59:07.877 --> 59:10.113
But you can decide.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.158
I have decided.

59:13.449 --> 59:16.295
To give everybody what they want.

59:17.820 --> 59:19.410
No...

59:19.510 --> 59:22.194
you can decide what you wanna be.

59:22.294 --> 59:24.470
You can choose.

59:26.662 --> 59:28.408
Love.

59:30.766 --> 59:34.570
Silly. You're just a silly boy.

59:34.670 --> 59:38.584
You don't know a thing about me,
you don't even know yourself.

59:39.108 --> 59:41.778
Just do everybody a favor and leave.

59:41.878 --> 59:44.911
I'm not a good person, Chase.

01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:13.530
This... this is living, my friend.

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.777
This is living.

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.137
Let's go play some games
that are rigged, or what?

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.182
Let's do it, man.

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:31.490
I love this, man.

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:43.894
You know, I know
we haven't talked much, but...

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:48.267
the whole point of this
is to pick up hot girls,

01:02:48.367 --> 01:02:50.417
play games,

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:52.407
and have fun, you know?

01:02:54.169 --> 01:02:57.016
There's a lot on my mind.

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:02.988
Man, that's why I'm here, dude.

01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:07.793
We're reliving our childhood dreams
of winning a unicorn.

01:03:08.884 --> 01:03:10.762
Eating funnel cakes...

01:03:10.862 --> 01:03:14.308
and, like, having good ol' fashioned fun,
you know, that's just what it's...

01:03:14.408 --> 01:03:17.059
Oh, my God.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:19.372
Is that the Mind Twister?

01:03:20.913 --> 01:03:23.174
I told myself when I came back
I was gonna conquer that,

01:03:23.274 --> 01:03:25.568
and we're gonna do that today, okay?

01:03:25.668 --> 01:03:27.970
So what do you say? Let's go ride that.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:30.696
Let's go! Let's go, buddy!

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.860
You made me cry once, you bastard.

01:03:41.283 --> 01:03:42.852
But not today.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:46.655
I'm gonna ride you
without throwing up today!

01:03:46.755 --> 01:03:47.865
Yeah!

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:10.546
Yeah!

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.992
No, man, not again!

01:04:27.229 --> 01:04:29.675
Not a word, Chase.

01:04:32.234 --> 01:04:34.570
Damn you, Mind Twister.

01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:36.939
I'm gonna beat you someday, man.

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.884
Someday.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.312
Could that be Sin?

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:28.034
Like the new look?

01:05:28.557 --> 01:05:31.837
You've gone mad,
Sin would never give you power.

01:05:32.378 --> 01:05:34.223
Let's move!

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:50.789
What were you doing here?

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:54.393
Gotcha!

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:57.296
Now the fun starts.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.273
Where am I?

01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.677
You're in the woods,
what does it look like?

01:06:12.534 --> 01:06:14.747
Fair enough.

01:06:17.005 --> 01:06:19.018
Where's Dawn?

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:28.951
Chase, better run along like a good boy

01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:32.106
and let the adults talk.

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.523
Dawn is waiting nearby.

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:39.305
And if I were you, I would hurry
before the full moon comes.

01:06:39.845 --> 01:06:41.657
What have you done to her?

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.447
There isn't much time, go!

01:06:58.547 --> 01:07:01.628
- What about you?
- I can handle myself, now go!

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:13.601
I am Kaio of The One.

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:17.676
And I don't give a shit!

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:24.475
Mind Twister wins again.

01:07:27.042 --> 01:07:28.787
Dawn!

01:07:30.245 --> 01:07:32.024
Dawn!

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:35.594
I think they left your hands untied.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.089
All right, that's cool.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:42.168
Yeah, that's good, just breathe that in.

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:06.343
I hope I'm not too late.

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:14.490
I know you're in there, Dawn.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:18.069
Nothing can stop what is true nature.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:22.163
- Kill him.
- Come to your senses, Dawn!

01:08:22.663 --> 01:08:25.879
I am the apex!

01:08:27.935 --> 01:08:29.648
Dawn!

01:08:30.615 --> 01:08:32.859
This isn't you!

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.981
- Come on, go.
- Dawn, she's just...

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:39.925
Trust me.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.649
You have the audacity...

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.051
to come into my home...

01:08:53.352 --> 01:08:55.953
and disrespect me?

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.756
How dare you ruin my fun?

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.354
I am Gecko!

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:11.805
Of Titan!

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:16.448
Celestial immortal!

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.366
And I challenge you.

01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:33.202
Are you ready?

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:35.147
I am.

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:46.292
I've never seen someone recover
so far from the Wolfsbane spell.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:49.017
This may be a challenge after all.

01:09:49.117 --> 01:09:51.127
Good...

01:09:51.227 --> 01:09:53.026
there is some fight in you.

01:09:54.656 --> 01:09:57.603
But you're gonna need more than that...

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:00.439
for me.

01:10:06.468 --> 01:10:08.180
Dawn!

01:10:47.626 --> 01:10:50.274
The war's just getting started!

01:10:51.813 --> 01:10:53.892
Are you ready?

01:11:12.734 --> 01:11:15.404
Good, daughter of Henrick.

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.383
Very good.

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:21.176
Yeah, well, you're the werewolf...

01:11:21.276 --> 01:11:23.856
but so far you've been like a bitch!

01:11:26.481 --> 01:11:28.727
Make no mistake.

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.964
I will kill you.

01:11:34.122 --> 01:11:36.525
Bold words.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:39.404
Let's see if you can back them up.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.701
Stop!

01:12:17.299 --> 01:12:20.746
No one's ever drawn on strength...
faction serpent attack.

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.479
Come on!

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.669
Venom strike.

01:13:47.522 --> 01:13:49.968
What you feel now...

01:13:50.458 --> 01:13:53.803
coursing through your veins,

01:13:54.203 --> 01:13:57.260
is more potent than any venom...

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.600
Found in your...

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.405
King Cobra snake.

01:14:06.107 --> 01:14:09.143
I'm surprised you're still breathing.

01:14:14.749 --> 01:14:19.062
But I suspect that in a matter
of minutes,

01:14:19.162 --> 01:14:22.497
you'll lose all sensation in your body.

01:14:22.597 --> 01:14:27.205
As your organs begin to shut down.

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:33.101
No one's ever survived my venom strike,

01:14:33.201 --> 01:14:35.246
and the reason...

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.271
the reason no one's ever
survived my venom strike...

01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:42.888
listen closely, this is very important.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:49.169
And the reason no one's ever survived
my venom strike

01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:53.949
is because the venom is directly linked

01:14:54.049 --> 01:14:55.933
to my heartbeat.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:06.478
So with each beat of my heart,

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.866
the venom continues...

01:15:09.966 --> 01:15:12.226
to find its way...

01:15:12.326 --> 01:15:16.539
deeper and deeper...

01:15:16.639 --> 01:15:21.626
and deeper into your veins.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.954
So you see...

01:15:25.324 --> 01:15:28.061
the only way to live...

01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:30.636
is to kill me.

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.519
And that...

01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:40.036
is why this attack is foolproof

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:42.647
and will never fail.

01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:47.343
Because while you lie there
writhing in pain...

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:52.914
unable to find the energy
to fill your lungs with air,

01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:57.596
I have the strength to finish you off!

01:15:58.253 --> 01:16:01.166
At my convenience.

01:16:02.223 --> 01:16:05.503
And what makes this
even more entertaining...

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:08.613
is that the same venom...

01:16:09.454 --> 01:16:12.578
is coursing through your girlfriend's
veins as well.

01:16:14.869 --> 01:16:17.918
But I have a special plan for her.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.879
Nothing to concern yourself with.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.958
As you won't be around to see it.

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:31.329
But let me just give you
a little hint and say...

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:39.304
I get to have a little fun.

01:16:48.636 --> 01:16:50.949
That power.

01:16:54.275 --> 01:16:56.188
But where?

01:16:58.913 --> 01:17:01.501
Could that power be her?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.739
That's not possible!

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.346
I can't see your weak points!

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:25.590
You will pay for those you have hurt.

01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:27.859
I can't see your weak points...

01:17:28.248 --> 01:17:30.312
I am the apex.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:32.924
I have no weakness.

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:41.299
Whole faction serpent attack.

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:48.140
Venom strike!

01:17:58.073 --> 01:17:59.975
Are you having fun yet?

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.454
You're too late!

01:18:18.193 --> 01:18:20.762
Wouldn't you know...

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.908
how fun.

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:52.737
Sounds like everything's
going according to plan.

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:58.109
Sounded like one of your own!

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:02.737
A necessary evil.

01:19:02.837 --> 01:19:05.173
Gecko served his purpose,

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.886
as you soon shall.

01:19:11.112 --> 01:19:13.558
No, no.

01:19:15.049 --> 01:19:17.095
Get ready.

01:19:22.957 --> 01:19:27.505
What's the matter? A second ago
you said you were gonna kill me.

01:19:28.129 --> 01:19:29.964
How disappointing.

01:19:30.064 --> 01:19:35.180
To see that your diatribe
was merely hollow words.

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:40.452
You have no place here.

01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:50.895
I can hear what you're thinking,
daughter of Henrick.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:01.358
Father... I have failed you.

01:20:07.935 --> 01:20:09.248
Hey.

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:16.335
I think mind surfing's a bit safer
in comparison to all of this.
