22:27.780 --> 22:29.214
<i>Dana: Ladies and gentlemen,
three minutes to air.</i>

22:29.281 --> 22:30.771
<i>Can I have first team
in the studio?</i>

22:30.849 --> 22:33.250
<i>Dan, Casey, that's you.</i>

22:33.318 --> 22:35.082
-- <i>Casey, Dan, let's go.</i>
-- <i>Come on, I'm still here.</i>

22:35.154 --> 22:36.622
-- Who's he on the phone with?
-- Ted Lewis.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.019
You're assistant
athletic director.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.558
Don't tell me
you weren't on the call.

22:39.625 --> 22:40.820
Are you nervous
about something?

22:40.893 --> 22:42.122
-- No.
-- Really?

22:42.194 --> 22:44.356
<i>All right, Ted, I'm gonna
get my notes right now.</i>

22:44.430 --> 22:47.627
Natalie, we might have something coming
in from Chapel Hill, so tell Dana.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.565
You're not nervous
about the Esquire piece?

22:49.635 --> 22:51.069
No. God, no.

22:51.136 --> 22:52.103
-- You seem nervous.
-- I'm not.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.104
Well, have you seen it yet?

22:53.172 --> 22:54.196
-- <i>The Esquire piece?</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

22:54.273 --> 22:55.069
No.

22:55.140 --> 22:56.266
-- You didn't get an advanced copy?
-- Nope.

22:56.341 --> 22:58.639
-- I'd be nervous. -- I'm not.
-- So you said.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.145
Now, if I'm nervous about anything,
it's that I think I have a stalker.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.874
-- A stalker, who?
-- Mm-hmm.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.110
-- One of the “CSC Morning“
aerobics women. -- Sandy?

23:05.184 --> 23:06.481
-- Is her name Sandy?
-- Randy?

23:06.552 --> 23:07.576
-- Mandy.
-- Mandy.

23:07.653 --> 23:08.677
-- <i>Madeline.
Casey: Natalie!</i>

23:08.754 --> 23:10.051
Oh! Uh, I'm sorry.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.591
You want a minute and a half
with a 30-second Q&A?

23:12.658 --> 23:14.387
-- Yeah, but get me some
elbow room, and get Kim.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.451
So, if I appear nervous
about anything, that's it.

23:16.528 --> 23:19.190
It's the prospect of being stalked
by a fitness professional,

23:19.264 --> 23:22.131
and it's not at all owing to this magazine
article that's coming out tomorrow.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.566
But can I just say
one thing about --

23:23.635 --> 23:24.864
Excuse me!
Hey, would you let her go?

23:24.937 --> 23:27.531
-- Sorry.
-- Casey!

23:27.606 --> 23:29.199
Yeah. Ted, I will mention
the word "Heisman"

23:29.274 --> 23:30.241
in connection with Gerardi's
name for the next 12 weeks.

23:30.309 --> 23:31.504
Just give me this one.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.568
<i>Dana: Dan, Casey,
to the studio.</i>

23:33.645 --> 23:36.239
Can you hang on a second,
Ted? Thanks. What?

23:36.315 --> 23:38.875
Natalie says my stalker's
name is Mandy.

23:38.951 --> 23:42.182
Really? I don't know what the
hell we're talking about.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.018
<i>Hey, Casey, Natalie said
you need me.</i>

23:44.089 --> 23:45.614
<i>Yeah. Uh,
Ted, hold on a second.</i>

23:45.691 --> 23:47.955
Yeah, I want you
to work Ted Lewis.

23:48.026 --> 23:49.653
Get him to say
they're firing Zapod,

23:49.728 --> 23:51.992
and they're gonna promote
the offensive coordinator.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.498
-- It's on line 12.
-- Ted, it's Kim.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.397
You were in town,
and you didn't call me.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.595
And have Elliott flag me
as soon as you've got it!

23:57.669 --> 24:00.570
It's not like I'm not used
to being written about.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.936
-- Yeah, sure.
-- Right?

24:02.007 --> 24:05.341
Once again, I don't know what
the hell we're talking about.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.538
<i>Hey, look, everybody!
It's two sports anchors.</i>

24:07.613 --> 24:08.910
And that's a good break for us

24:08.981 --> 24:10.779
'cause we're about to do
a sports show.

24:10.849 --> 24:13.318
-- Sarcasm, thy name is Dana.
-- 30 seconds.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.649
<i>Toby Benes has a no-hitter
in the seventh.</i>

24:15.721 --> 24:18.452
Put Benes in the teaser. If he takes it
to the ninth, we'll patch it in on one.

24:18.524 --> 24:19.491
-- 15.
-- 14.

24:19.558 --> 24:20.616
14's gone.
It's 15.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.285
-- Well, get it.
-- Got it.

24:22.361 --> 24:23.954
-- We shouldn't put it in the tease.
-- Why not?

24:24.029 --> 24:24.928
-- It's bad luck.
-- It's bad luck?

24:24.997 --> 24:26.226
To talk about a no-hitter.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.663
-- It's bad luck for the pitcher?
-- Yes.

24:27.733 --> 24:28.825
We don't work
for the pitcher.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.426
That puts us
in a hell of a dilemma.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.833
Actually, I'm fine.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.134
In 3...2...1.

24:34.206 --> 24:36.004
Good evening, everybody.
From New York City,

24:36.074 --> 24:38.509
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.774
Those stories, plus we're gonna hook
up with the Big East and the Big Ten.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.941
And we'll take you
to Jacobs Field

24:44.016 --> 24:47.543
where Toby Benes is working on
a no-hitter in the seventh.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.109
<i>AH that coming up
after this.</i>

24:49.187 --> 24:52.282
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so stick around.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.416
-- <i>We're out.</i>
-- <i>We're back in 60.</i>

24:54.493 --> 24:57.428
So, the stalker
has a name?

24:57.496 --> 24:58.463
Yeah, Mandy.

24:58.530 --> 24:59.622
I thought it was Sandy.

24:59.698 --> 25:00.688
Randy!

25:00.766 --> 25:02.256
Mandy -- Madeline.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.496
About teasing the no-hitter,
it was a tough call,

25:04.570 --> 25:07.562
and I just wanted to tell you that while
I didn't agree with the decision,

25:07.639 --> 25:09.937
I have a lot of respect
for you for making it.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.306
Benes just lost
the no-hitter.

25:12.377 --> 25:14.937
Don't blame yourself.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.981
Thank you.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.548
Oh, Casey, how many times
are you gonna read it?

25:25.624 --> 25:26.955
I'm searching for nuance.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.720
How much trouble
is Danny in?

25:28.794 --> 25:31.092
Look, don't get me wrong.
Dan's my closest friend.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.393
I like to think of our
relationship <i>as</i> selfless,

25:33.465 --> 25:35.695
but at the moment
I'm not as concerned about him

25:35.767 --> 25:37.462
as I am about --
how shall I say --

25:37.536 --> 25:38.526
-- You?
-- Me, yes.

25:38.604 --> 25:39.969
I'm concerned
about this sense --

25:40.038 --> 25:41.233
this sense that everything

25:41.306 --> 25:42.637
that's written
about the two of us --

25:42.708 --> 25:44.972
that Dan is cool, and I am...

25:45.043 --> 25:46.670
-- What is the word?
-- Not.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.679
Yes, that Dan is cool,
and I am not.

25:48.747 --> 25:50.681
There is this sense --
there is this perception --

25:50.749 --> 25:51.944
Hey, I need to talk to you.

25:52.017 --> 25:53.610
There is a perception
in the press

25:53.685 --> 25:55.119
never more clear
than in this article

25:55.187 --> 25:56.484
that I'm not cool.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.319
Now where do you think
this perception comes from?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.324
-- I think it comes from reality.
-- Really?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.121
Come -- talk to me.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.959
-- It could be his haircut.
-- Hey, I heard that.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.930
So, how much trouble
is Dan gonna be in?

26:06.999 --> 26:09.297
It depends
if Sachs has seen it.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.463
-- Sachs has seen it. -- It's been on the
newsstand for four hours, and Sachs has seen it?

26:12.537 --> 26:15.268
-- Sachs has seen it. -- VVell, then we can
anticipate a certain degree of trouble.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.240
Didn't Isaac tell you
to keep an eye out for him

26:17.309 --> 26:18.799
when the two of you
were doing press?

26:18.877 --> 26:20.003
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- What happened?

26:20.078 --> 26:22.342
I'm working out some kinks
in the system.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.007
There's a lawyer over here

26:24.082 --> 26:26.642
with a guy from
Standards and Practices.

26:26.718 --> 26:27.776
We have
standards and practices?

26:27.853 --> 26:29.014
It's a whole wing
of the --

26:29.087 --> 26:31.283
No, I mean we have actual
standards and practices?

26:31.356 --> 26:32.846
So you don't think
it's serious?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.653
I'll tell you
what I think is serious

26:34.726 --> 26:36.785
is this perception --
this sense --

26:36.862 --> 26:37.988
Casey.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.031
[sighs] Dana...

26:40.098 --> 26:42.032
He belongs to a fly-by-night
organization

26:42.100 --> 26:44.159
that supports the legalization
of marijuana,

26:44.236 --> 26:45.704
and he said so
in a magazine.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.569
Is the network gonna be
happy about it? No.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.471
Is Sachs gonna order someone
to order someone

26:49.541 --> 26:51.168
to slap him on the knuckles?
Probably.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.472
In the scheme of things,

26:52.544 --> 26:54.535
a much larger issue
is that I am cool.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.672
I'm completely cool, huh?

26:56.748 --> 26:58.216
And you dress cool.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.341
That's right.

26:59.418 --> 27:00.749
Wait, that was a dig,
wasn't it?

27:00.819 --> 27:02.913
-- Casey! -- What, you
think it's the clothes?

27:02.988 --> 27:04.149
I think it's the haircut.

27:04.222 --> 27:05.314
Excuse me?

27:05.390 --> 27:07.950
She said she thinks
it's the haircut.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.494
Thank you.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.529
Look --
now what can I do for you?

27:11.596 --> 27:13.496
Jeremy is cutting his first
highlight package today.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.532
Good.

27:14.599 --> 27:17.432
-- It's the Cubs/Marlins day
game at Wrigley. -- That's fine.

27:17.502 --> 27:18.697
-- It's a day game.
-- Yes.

27:18.770 --> 27:21.535
There'll be plenty of time to make
any changes that need to be made.

27:21.606 --> 27:22.596
Right.

27:22.674 --> 27:25.473
Will you look at it when it's
done and give him feedback?

27:25.544 --> 27:26.568
-- Yeah.
-- Thanks.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.477
Is there anything else?

27:28.547 --> 27:31.244
VVell, uh, don't you want to
know why I'm not doing it?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.751
If you think
you need to tell me.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.117
I may have certain
feelings for Jeremy.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.748
-- Ah. -- I think it's
possible that I have feelings.

27:38.824 --> 27:42.021
-- Okay. -- I think these feelings could interfere
with my judgment as far as his work is concerned.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.085
I admire
your professionalism.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.756
These feelings have been growing
inside of me like a rush or a surge --

27:46.832 --> 27:49.267
I think this is a little more
than I need to know about --

27:49.334 --> 27:50.392
-- Fine.
-- Okay, thanks.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.436
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

27:51.503 --> 27:52.800
-- You'll be nice to him?
-- Yeah.

27:52.871 --> 27:54.134
-- It's his first time.
-- I know.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.298
-- Be nice.
-- I will.

27:55.373 --> 27:56.966
Jeremy is cutting
his first highlight tape.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.476
-- Casey's gonna look at it.
-- Good.

27:58.543 --> 28:00.409
Yeah, I'd look at it myself,
but I have certain feelings --

28:00.479 --> 28:02.971
-- Natalie!
-- <i>Fine!</i>

28:03.048 --> 28:04.914
Hey, speaking
of certain feelings,

28:04.983 --> 28:07.884
I couldn't help but notice
by the elevators this morning

28:07.953 --> 28:09.512
that Mandy
the aerobics stalker

28:09.588 --> 28:12.216
seemed to be showing
no interest in you whatsoever.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.054
That's how the game
is played.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.958
Oh, yeah.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.223
Her disinterest
was a performance.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.923
Well, she's good.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.966
Yeah, I'll say.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.365
-- Hey, what time is your meeting?
-- Right now.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.631
-- Where?
-- Isaac's office.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.796
And yet you're here.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.601
Yeah, I'm making him
wait for me.

28:28.673 --> 28:29.834
Why?

28:29.908 --> 28:31.137
It's part of my strategy.

28:31.209 --> 28:32.904
Yeah? Well, it sounds
pretty sophisticated.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.104
Yep.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.305
Danny...

28:35.380 --> 28:37.940
We did the interview for
this piece three months ago.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.007
I don't want to pile it on
or anything,

28:40.085 --> 28:41.814
but when you know something
like this is gonna happen,

28:41.887 --> 28:44.151
you might want to tell me
about it in advance.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.917
Casey, they completely
missed the point.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.619
I didn't know they were gonna completely
miss the point three months in advance.

28:48.693 --> 28:50.092
Well, what was the point?

28:50.162 --> 28:53.097
The point was that any law that makes
criminals out of 15 million Americans

28:53.165 --> 28:55.429
is probably
not such a good idea.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.800
The point was that drug abuse isn't a
criminal issue, it's a health care issue.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.669
And the money and manpower that we spend
prosecuting a surfer in San Diego

29:01.740 --> 29:05.005
might better be used fighting things that genuinely
threaten our national health and safety.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.475
That was the point.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.276
-- VVell, then they completely
missed the point. -- Yes.

29:09.347 --> 29:11.441
Hey, can I change
the subject a second?

29:11.516 --> 29:13.348
-- Please. -- What's up
with me not being cool?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.182
-- What is up with that?
-- I love music.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.187
-- I have a great appreciation of music.
-- Dude, I've been in your car.

29:17.255 --> 29:19.519
You've got the Starland Vocal
Band singing “Afternoon Delight.“

29:19.591 --> 29:20.752
That's right.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.692
Wait, I do not have
the Starland Vocal Band.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.729
It's not like I went out
and bought the single.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.787
It's on my "Time-Life:
Sounds of the Seventies."

29:26.865 --> 29:28.629
Well, there you have it.

29:28.700 --> 29:29.963
[Sighs]

29:30.035 --> 29:32.026
How can I be cool again?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.662
I'm a newly divorced man.

29:33.738 --> 29:35.206
I'm young.
I used to be cool.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.365
I need to be cool again.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.001
Help me be cool again.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.944
Well, first I'd have to
disabuse you of the notion

29:42.013 --> 29:43.708
that you were
ever cool before.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.341
All right,
go to your meeting.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.714
I told you
I'm makin' 'em wait.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.911
No,
you're makin' 'em mad.

29:47.986 --> 29:49.579
No, I'm making them
anxious.

29:49.654 --> 29:51.554
I think
you're just makin' 'em mad.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.684
I think Isaac specifically
is mad.

29:54.759 --> 29:56.853
No, Isaac's on my team.
Isaac understands me.

29:56.928 --> 29:59.363
Isaac has a highly developed
sense of right and wrong,

29:59.431 --> 30:00.990
and he is hip
to my battle plan.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.898
Danny, he's standing
right behind you.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.697
How you doin'?

30:04.769 --> 30:07.534
Casey and I were just talking about your
highly developed sense of right and wrong,

30:07.606 --> 30:09.005
and I was saying --

30:09.074 --> 30:12.100
Go sit your sorry ass
down in that meeting.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.269
On my way, sir.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.779
-- Hey, Isaac.
-- Yeah?

30:14.846 --> 30:17.008
You think I'm cool,
don't you?

30:17.082 --> 30:20.541
Do I look like I'm in
the mood to do this now?

30:20.619 --> 30:21.586
Not really.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.951
Then let's assume I'm not.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.582
<i>Dan: I was not encouraging
people to take drugs.</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:28.592
-- That's ridiculous.
-- That's how it reads.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.526
-- It's not how it reads to me.
-- That's how it reads to us.

30:30.595 --> 30:33.360
-- You're reading it wrong. --
That's how it reads to Luther Sachs.

30:33.431 --> 30:36.696
<i>I don't know if you've noticed, but we're
fighting a war against drugs in this county.</i>

30:36.768 --> 30:37.929
How's it goin' so far?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.869
-- <i>Danny...</i>
-- <i>You may find this amusing</i> --

30:39.938 --> 30:41.736
Actually, I don't find it
in the least amusing.

30:41.806 --> 30:44.935
Howard Stern did 15 minutes
on you this morning.

30:45.010 --> 30:48.640
<i>He said that Dan Rydell lends a whole
new meaning to the word "highlights."</i>

30:48.713 --> 30:51.273
Howard Stern's a professional comedian.
That's his job.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.875
We've already had a call from the
Partnership For a Drug-Free America.

30:53.952 --> 30:55.784
I happen to be a member
of that organization.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.322
<i>Dan,
I understand your position,</i>

30:57.389 --> 30:59.084
and I don't necessarily
disagree with it,

30:59.157 --> 31:00.716
but this is a sports network.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.818
Our sponsors expect us to project an
image of good health and clean living.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.989
<i>I'll think about that
the next time I'm reporting</i>

31:06.064 --> 31:08.465
on how the Miller Genuine Draft
car did in the Winston Cup.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.796
Now, listen,
I don't think --

31:09.868 --> 31:12.394
Fellas, he's got
a show to prepare.

31:12.470 --> 31:13.835
How do we fix this?

31:13.905 --> 31:16.306
Luther Sachs suggests
an apology.

31:17.842 --> 31:20.140
An apOIOQY?

31:20.211 --> 31:22.839
He suggests you take a moment
tonight during your broadcast --

31:22.914 --> 31:24.609
He wants
an on-air apology?

31:24.683 --> 31:26.310
-- He's suggesting --
-- <i>To</i> whom?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.909
To you.
He's suggesting to you.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.683
-- To whom does he want me to apologize?
-- To your viewers.

31:30.755 --> 31:32.245
What did I do
to my viewers?

31:32.324 --> 31:35.089
The ones who may have
read this and misinterpreted.

31:35.160 --> 31:36.924
No, Luther Sachs
misinterpreted.

31:36.995 --> 31:40.192
Luther Sachs is the C.E.O.
of a very large company.

31:40.265 --> 31:42.290
Well, thank him
for his suggestion,

31:42.367 --> 31:44.665
but tell him
I'm gonna respectfully pass.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.205
Why don't we just skip down
to the end of the page.

31:47.272 --> 31:50.333
You, like every other on-air
personality at this network,

31:50.408 --> 31:52.877
has a morals clause
in your contract.

31:52.944 --> 31:55.504
Are you now saying
what I did was immoral

31:55.580 --> 31:57.981
because Luther Sachs
doesn't agree with me?

31:58.049 --> 32:00.541
Most of the country
doesn't agree with you.

32:00.618 --> 32:03.610
The validity of your read on
what most of the country thinks

32:03.688 --> 32:05.019
not withstanding,
Stanley,

32:05.090 --> 32:09.186
actions are immoral,
opinions are not.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.123
And I won't apologize
for mine.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.722
<i>Discussion is good.</i>

32:13.798 --> 32:15.163
<i>And for those of us
fortunate enough</i>

32:15.233 --> 32:17.361
to be the subject
of magazine articles,

32:17.435 --> 32:19.870
it may be our responsibility
from time to time

32:19.938 --> 32:21.963
to try and raise
the level of debate.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.566
<i>[Sighs ] Plus, there's
the health insurance issue.</i>

32:24.642 --> 32:25.939
-- Health insurance?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

32:26.011 --> 32:28.139
What does my insurance policy
have to do --

32:28.213 --> 32:29.703
Our insurance policy.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.907
<i>You're quoted
in the article</i>

32:30.982 --> 32:33.076
as saying you haven't
taken drugs in 11 years.

32:33.151 --> 32:34.915
11 years today,
as a matter of fact.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.482
And that's true.

32:37.555 --> 32:38.920
11 is an old number.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.549
Yeah,
it's also a prime number.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.354
<i>He meant
that it's an unusual number.</i>

32:42.427 --> 32:44.589
He meant
that you were specific.

32:44.662 --> 32:46.528
You didn't say
"10 or 15 years."

32:46.598 --> 32:48.327
You said,
"11 years ago today."

32:48.400 --> 32:50.767
This caught the attention
of our insurance company

32:50.835 --> 32:53.133
because this is normally
the kind of information

32:53.204 --> 32:55.229
that only a recovering
addict or alcoholic

32:55.306 --> 32:56.432
has at their fingertips.

32:56.508 --> 32:57.703
Hell, Isaac! Please!

32:57.776 --> 32:59.437
We carry an expensive policy
on you, Dan.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.479
Now you took a physical,
and you answered questions.

33:01.546 --> 33:03.571
Now we could be on the hook
for insurance fraud here.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.013
I'm ending this now.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.244
Thank you.

33:06.317 --> 33:08.615
Do what they're
telling you to do.

33:08.686 --> 33:09.949
-- Really?
-- Yes.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.046
You think
I should apologize?

33:12.123 --> 33:14.057
No, but you're going to
anyway.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.752
-- Why?
-- Because this is television.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.761
And this is how it's done.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.093
Yeah, well, sitting in the back
of the bus was how it was done

33:20.165 --> 33:21.690
until a 42-year-old lady
moved up front.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.791
I'm not very impressed with
how things are done, Isaac.

33:23.868 --> 33:25.859
Be that as it may,
we'll do it tonight.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.302
That's all.
We're done.

33:28.773 --> 33:30.935
-- You know, you might --
-- We're done, Stanley.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.415
Uh, that was
a lot of fun, huh?

33:40.485 --> 33:41.475
<i>[Laughs]</i>

33:41.553 --> 33:42.714
Yeah.

33:42.787 --> 33:45.119
Take 30 seconds before
the second commercial break,

33:45.190 --> 33:47.284
then get us right back
into the show.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.452
You know, I don't have any
idea what I'm gonna say.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.461
You'll think of something.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.258
I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.231
-- Apologize.
-- To who?

33:55.300 --> 33:57.064
Who cares?

33:59.104 --> 34:00.799
-- Danny.
-- Yeah?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.738
You know I love you,
don't you?

34:02.807 --> 34:04.138
Yeah.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.837
And because I love you,
I can say this.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.505
No rich, young, white guy
has ever gotten anywhere with me

34:10.581 --> 34:12.812
comparing himself
to Rosa Parks.

34:14.752 --> 34:16.447
Got it?

34:16.521 --> 34:18.319
Yes, sir.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.050
Good.

34:23.094 --> 34:25.654
[Door closes]

34:33.170 --> 34:35.139
Hey, Jeremy,
you got a second?

34:35.206 --> 34:36.435
You bet.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.203
I looked over your, uh,
Cubs/Marlins tape.

34:38.275 --> 34:39.266
-- Yes?
-- And it's good.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.641
-- Thank you.
-- It's very good.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.908
-- Especially for your first time out.
-- Thank you very much.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.609
I guess the one note that I would
have for you would be about length.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.014
-- Yes?
-- Yeah.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.679
Usually we get, uh, 30 to
40 seconds for each game --

34:49.754 --> 34:52.188
a little bit more
if it's a game chock-full

34:52.257 --> 34:55.022
of spectacular plays
and/or playoff consequences,

34:55.092 --> 34:57.118
and a little bit less
if it goes the other way.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.323
But 30 to 40 seconds is
usually the rule of thumb.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.728
I see.
And how long did mine run?

35:00.798 --> 35:02.698
81/2 minutes.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.734
Ah.

35:03.801 --> 35:04.859
Yeah.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.030
-- That's long. -- Yeah, it
ran a little over. Yeah.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.334
I don't know what to do.

35:08.406 --> 35:09.896
You should make it shorter.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.100
I tried everything.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.167
You should try
making it shorter.

35:13.244 --> 35:14.143
What's the key?

35:14.212 --> 35:15.145
-- In this case...
-- Yeah.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.204
Making it a lot shorter.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.807
I can't imagine
what I'd cut.

35:18.883 --> 35:21.443
VVell, you start off with
Cedric, the leadoff batter

35:21.519 --> 35:23.146
in the top
of the first inning,

35:23.221 --> 35:26.020
despite the fact that nobody
scored till the fifth inning.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.421
There's action
beyond scoring.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.290
Yeah, but Cedric grounded out
to the shortstop

35:29.360 --> 35:31.658
-- and was throw out at first by
quite a large margin. -- Yeah.

35:31.729 --> 35:34.221
Well, that is what is called
a routine ground ball.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.631
In your search for things
that are newsworthy,

35:36.701 --> 35:38.897
let the word "routine"
serve as a danger sign.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.563
There's nothing routine
about it.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.073
Casey, the guy's hitting .327
since the All-Star break,

35:43.141 --> 35:45.235
he has drawn <i>22</i> walks
in the leadoff position,

35:45.310 --> 35:46.869
and he's a threat
to steal second

35:46.945 --> 35:48.106
every time you put him on.

35:48.179 --> 35:49.669
He fouled off seven pitches.

35:49.747 --> 35:52.409
-- And you show each and every one of them.
-- You bet I do.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.214
We usually just show the pitch
that puts the ball into play.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.380
-- But then you miss the battle.
-- The battle?

35:57.455 --> 35:59.514
Yeah, he started him off
with a fastball up and in.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.252
Then slider away,
slider away,

36:01.326 --> 36:03.317
comes back with
a split-fingered change,

36:03.394 --> 36:06.056
drops the curve off the table,
sets him up off-speed,

36:06.130 --> 36:07.564
then jams him
high and tight.

36:07.632 --> 36:08.861
That's what got him out.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.924
It was a ground ball
to the shortstop.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.027
The inevitable conclusion
to a job well done.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.299
[Sighs deeply]

36:14.372 --> 36:17.137
We have 14 baseball games
to cover.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.141
Yeah.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.608
-- 30 seconds apiece.
-- Right.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.145
Your tape
is 8 1/2 minutes.

36:21.212 --> 36:22.373
I'm at a loss.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.142
You got to make it
shorter!

36:24.215 --> 36:25.410
I'm just not seeing it.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.511
All right, come with me.
Come on.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.782
<i>Dana: Animation 18
is a full-screen wash.</i>

36:30.855 --> 36:32.823
Is it over the shoulder?

36:32.890 --> 36:34.756
-- I think it's over the shoulder.
-- It's over the shoulder.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.726
-- <i>And that's...</i>
-- <i>2 for 9 inside the red zone.</i>

36:36.794 --> 36:38.057
Dave, is it the monitors,

36:38.129 --> 36:40.598
or is the background on the drop
starting to look beige?

36:40.665 --> 36:41.757
It's not beige.
It's tan.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.267
It's the gels.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.132
-- It's not the gels. It's the monitors.
-- It's the gels.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.228
<i>Well, take a look at it, because
it's starting to give me a headache.</i>

36:47.305 --> 36:49.330
-- <i>You want some aspirin?</i> -- <i>I
want you to fix the monitors.</i>

36:49.407 --> 36:51.398
-- It's the gels.
-- Take it outside.

36:51.476 --> 36:53.342
-- Back here at 10:00.
-- Oh!

36:53.411 --> 36:55.402
Dan needs a little time
before the second break.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.743
We'll come out of
Kyle's remote,

36:56.814 --> 36:58.612
Casey will throw it to Dan
for 45 seconds,

36:58.683 --> 36:59.946
and he'll take us to commercial.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.315
He's really gonna apologize?

37:01.386 --> 37:02.512
-- Yeah.
-- To who?

37:02.587 --> 37:04.521
I don't write
Dan's scripts.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.114
Thank you, everybody.

37:06.190 --> 37:07.658
Have you checked
on the guys?

37:07.725 --> 37:10.217
Dan's in research, and Casey's
in editing with Jeremy.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.320
-- Do they need anything?
-- Casey needs a woman.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.660
Casey needs a woman?

37:13.731 --> 37:15.165
He needs a woman.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.359
Don't start that.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.697
-- He needs a woman, Dana.
-- Mnh.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.534
He's a single man living
his life in an empty apartment.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.266
He got divorced
two weeks ago.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.001
He needs spoons.
He needs forks.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.509
He needs a woman.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.738
I don't want to talk about this.
Run me through the promo.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.337
-- Now, should we be --
-- He's reaching out!

37:29.414 --> 37:31.542
-- He's not reaching out. --
He's reaching right out to you!

37:31.616 --> 37:33.015
He's not reaching
anywhere near me.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.075
-- You're missing the signs.
-- I am not missing the signs.

37:35.153 --> 37:36.177
Wait, really?

37:36.254 --> 37:38.780
Reaching
right out to you!

37:40.825 --> 37:42.884
<i>Casey: We've been at this
for two hours now,</i>

37:42.960 --> 37:45.088
<i>which is just slightly longer
than your coverage</i>

37:45.163 --> 37:46.426
of the seventh-inning stretch.

37:46.497 --> 37:47.555
[Knock on glass]

37:47.632 --> 37:48.793
How's it going in there!

37:48.866 --> 37:50.300
It's going real good.

37:50.368 --> 37:52.996
Casey and I are having some very
healthy creative differences.

37:53.071 --> 37:55.631
Casey listens to
the Starland Vocal Band, so --

37:55.707 --> 37:56.799
Go away from me now!

37:56.874 --> 37:58.467
-- Shout if you need me!
-- Now!

38:00.778 --> 38:02.143
Okay, this section here

38:02.213 --> 38:04.739
where the batter taps dirt off
his shoe and spits four times --

38:04.816 --> 38:06.284
-- We can't cut that!
-- Jeremy!

38:06.351 --> 38:08.183
Well, the storm clouds
are gathering.

38:08.252 --> 38:10.050
[Sighs ] All right,
just out of curiosity,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.351
what voiceover would you have
me write for this moment?

38:12.423 --> 38:14.050
What's wrong with "The Storm
Clouds Are Gathering"?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.719
The storm clouds aren't gathering.
He's cleaning his shoe.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.262
He's breaking Carrera's
pitching rhythm.

38:18.329 --> 38:19.353
-- The battle?
-- The battle.

38:19.430 --> 38:20.693
The battle.
Okay, look --

38:20.765 --> 38:23.200
if people just want the score,
they can listen to the radio.

38:23.267 --> 38:26.362
We have an opportunity to affect
their appreciation of baseball.

38:26.437 --> 38:28.235
God knows
you've affected mine.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.104
Casey,
what are you working on?

38:30.174 --> 38:31.232
An epic miniseries.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.242
It's the Cubs/Marlins.

38:32.343 --> 38:33.902
I got to make room
for Danny's apology.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.446
Just give me
the double off the wall,

38:35.513 --> 38:37.345
the homer in the fifth,
and the error at third.

38:37.415 --> 38:40.043
-- That's a travesty. -- <i>I
need it</i> in my hands <i>right</i> now.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.984
Casey, we're on the air
in 15 minutes.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.919
All right.
I got to go change, Jeremy.

38:43.988 --> 38:47.083
The storm clouds
are gathering.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.922
Also, Lyle's interview
is gonna be live.

38:48.993 --> 38:49.983
I got that note.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.119
-- You got it?
-- Yep.

38:51.195 --> 38:52.526
-- I wasn't sure you got it.
-- I did.

38:52.597 --> 38:53.587
-- Casey.
-- Yeah?

38:53.664 --> 38:54.893
Do you have spoons?

38:54.966 --> 38:55.956
I'm sorry.

38:56.033 --> 38:57.626
Do you have spoons
and a fork?

38:57.702 --> 38:59.329
-- Do I have spoons and a fork?
-- To eat with.

38:59.404 --> 39:01.202
Yeah, I know
what they're for.

39:01.272 --> 39:04.242
I just thought cause you've only been
in the new apartment a couple of weeks,

39:04.308 --> 39:05.969
and with these hours
I thought maybe you --

39:06.043 --> 39:07.568
No, I've bought myself
spoons and a fork.

39:07.645 --> 39:08.669
-- Good.
-- Yeah.

39:08.746 --> 39:09.838
-- Good.
-- Okay, well...

39:09.914 --> 39:11.040
You got a whisk?

39:11.115 --> 39:13.243
A whisk?

39:13.317 --> 39:14.307
Yes.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.546
That's the thing you --

39:15.620 --> 39:16.951
For scrambled eggs.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.753
You -- You stir it
really fast in a bowl.

39:20.825 --> 39:23.453
-- I can't just use the fork?
-- Truthfully, yes.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.462
-- I got to go change.
-- Yeah.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.089
Yeah.

39:27.165 --> 39:28.155
Let's go.

39:28.232 --> 39:29.256
Um, show time.

39:29.333 --> 39:30.732
All right, come on!
Let's go, everybody!

39:30.802 --> 39:32.395
<i>Let's get in the zone!</i>

39:32.470 --> 39:35.337
<i>Casey: ...where the Bears were
2 for 9 inside the red zone.</i>

39:35.406 --> 39:38.273
For that we'll take you
to Kelly Kirkpatrick in Chicago.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.470
-- <i>Kelly.</i>
-- Thank <i>you, Casey.</i>

39:40.545 --> 39:42.843

Casey, just a heads-up.</i>

39:44.315 --> 39:45.942
<i>Take your time
on the scoreboard filler.</i>

39:46.017 --> 39:47.781
We're gonna have a 20-second gap
on the recap.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.752
-- Got it. -- You know
who I didn't see today?

39:49.821 --> 39:51.983
-- Mandy the healthy stalker?
-- That's right.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.956
That's 'cause she's
not stalking you.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.050
-- <i>Did you talk to
him about</i> -- -- <i>Yes.</i>

39:56.127 --> 39:57.458
-- Did he?
-- No.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.690
-- Did you talk to him about
spoons and forks? -- Yes.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.495
-- 20 seconds. -- Uh, come
in for a landing, Kelly.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.127
Is it just me,
or is the set turning beige?

40:05.203 --> 40:06.568
-- It's the gels.
-- It's the monitors.

40:06.637 --> 40:07.763
In 10.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.206
Jeremy, you did a good job
on that Cubs/Marlins game.

40:10.274 --> 40:12.106
I only wish
you could have seen the tape

40:12.176 --> 40:13.871
before the life
was sucked out of it

40:13.945 --> 40:15.674
by forces entirely beyond
my control.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.339
Jeremy.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.541
I know exactly
how you feel.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.710
-- <i>Quiet, please.</i>
-- <i>Casey, stand by.</i>

40:20.785 --> 40:22.116
<i>...take you back</i>

40:22.186 --> 40:24.655
to our "Sports Night" studio
in New York.

40:24.722 --> 40:26.281
Thank you,
Kelly Kirkpatrick.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.156
We'll be bringing you more
on that story on "NFL Kickoff,"

40:29.227 --> 40:32.128
Sunday morning,
10:00 Eastern Standard Time,

40:32.196 --> 40:35.029
and 1:00 if you're
watching us in Brussels.

40:35.099 --> 40:36.123
Dan.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.999
This network,
the Continental Sports Channel,

40:39.070 --> 40:41.767
has asked me to clarify
some remarks I made

40:41.839 --> 40:45.241
in a publication that hit
your newsstands this morning.

40:45.309 --> 40:47.539
It is possible that one could
come away from this article

40:47.612 --> 40:49.239
with the impression
that I don't believe

40:49.313 --> 40:53.443
that drugs are a destructive
and deadly force on our culture,

40:53.518 --> 40:57.216
our economy, and on
the lives of our children.

41:04.729 --> 41:05.696
Uh-oh.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.663
-- <i>Talk to me,</i> Dana.
-- <i>Stay with him.</i>

41:07.732 --> 41:10.064
<i>Casey, be ready to take us
to commercial.</i>

41:10.134 --> 41:12.432
Come on, Daniel.

41:16.741 --> 41:19.574
I have a younger brother
named Sam.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.840
Sam's a genius.
I mean literally.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.177
As a kid,
he tested off the charts.

41:24.248 --> 41:27.309
The first computer I ever had,
he built from a kit

41:27.385 --> 41:30.946
he bought with money he earned
tutoring other kids in math.

41:31.022 --> 41:34.356
He's energetic and articulate,
curious and funny,

41:34.425 --> 41:37.190
a great source of pride
to our parents.

41:37.261 --> 41:40.629
And there's no doubt that he'd
be living a great life right now

41:40.698 --> 41:42.188
except for that he's dead.

41:44.468 --> 41:46.232
'Cause when
you're 14 years old,

41:46.304 --> 41:48.773
all you ever really want to be
when you grow up

41:48.839 --> 41:51.206
is your 16-year-old brother,

41:51.275 --> 41:53.903
and in my case, that meant
smoking a lot of dope.

41:53.978 --> 41:56.743
<i>The day
I went off to college</i>

41:56.814 --> 42:00.216
was the day that Sam got
his driver's license,

42:00.284 --> 42:01.615
and he celebrated

42:01.686 --> 42:05.020
by taking a drive
with some of his friends...

42:05.089 --> 42:08.389
drunk
and high as a paper kite.

42:08.459 --> 42:12.794
<i>He never saw the red light
that he ran,</i>

42:12.863 --> 42:15.059
and he probably never saw
the 18-wheel truck

42:15.132 --> 42:17.897
that put him into the side
of a brick bank either.

42:29.981 --> 42:34.214
That was
11 years ago tonight,

42:34.285 --> 42:36.879
and I just wanted to say...

42:36.954 --> 42:40.015
I'm sorry, Sam.

42:41.192 --> 42:44.822
You deserved better
in my hands,

42:44.895 --> 42:48.229
and I apologize.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.459
That's all.

42:53.537 --> 42:55.528
Casey and I will be
right back after this

42:55.606 --> 42:57.096
with the American League
wrap-up.

42:57.174 --> 42:59.871
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so don't go away.
