16:06.800 --> 16:10.920
I’m so sorry, Mom.
It’s not your fault, kid.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.080
This village never wanted us anyway.
(INHALES)

16:14.240 --> 16:17.400
So that’s it?
We’re going back to London?

16:18.880 --> 16:22.200
Why doesn’t it feel good?
I’m gonna go pack.

16:23.880 --> 16:27.920
(SNIFFLES) Come, let us prepare

16:28.040 --> 16:33.040
their farewell song. (STARTS TO PLAY)
That’s it? There's got to be a way out.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.520
The candle popcorn smell.
Our best hope is figuring it out.

16:36.680 --> 16:40.120
No, we find that tapestry.
That’s the only way.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.320
They can’t banish you
if they have it--

16:42.520 --> 16:45.360
You’re leaving tomorrow.
You’re all leaving tomorrow.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.520
There’s no time for any of this.
You’ll be lucky if there’s time to pack.

16:49.680 --> 16:54.640
It wasn’t true what your mum said.
I wanted you to stay.

17:00.360 --> 17:03.560
I’m going to say goodbye to Sorsha.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.200
The first friends I make
in a thousand years...

17:09.360 --> 17:11.400
and I lose them.

17:13.080 --> 17:16.920
Why don’t I want to leave?
Because it’s home?

17:22.280 --> 17:27.720
(FROG CROAKING)

17:27.880 --> 17:30.200
(SURPRISED) Bridget’s alive!

17:33.000 --> 17:34.800
(FROG CROAKS)

17:40.760 --> 17:43.720
Otto, look.
Not the smell.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.000
Just humor me.
Put on a bunch of thoughts and emotions

17:47.120 --> 17:51.800
and we’ll see if any of them match
the smell. What have you got to lose?

17:51.960 --> 17:57.200
(SNIFFS) See, right now
you’re irritated but going to cave.

17:57.360 --> 18:02.000
So I just think different things
and you say what they smell like?

18:03.640 --> 18:06.560
(SNIFFS) Onions.
Anger.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.760
(SNIFFS) New books.
Optimism.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.000
I’ll try confusion.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.160
(SNIFFS) Ugh, ear wax.
Don’t get confused around me.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.240
Oh, no, I know that one,
that’s cupcakes. That’s attraction.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.400
What? Wait, that was a fake one, right?

18:24.600 --> 18:30.440
Yeah! This isn’t going to work, Bella.
There’s a thousand feelings and smells.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.440
What are the chances of finding whoever’s
giving off that candle popcorn emotion?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.240
Wait--
We need to find that tapestry!

18:49.520 --> 18:53.680
(SNIFFS) Candle!

18:53.840 --> 18:55.400
(SNIFFS) Blown out.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.840
(SNIFFS) Popcorn.
(SNIFFS) Stale.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.080
Salty.

19:05.240 --> 19:09.920
I was just trying to look for clues.
What were you feeling just now?

19:10.040 --> 19:12.520
You don’t smell cupcake again, do you?

19:12.680 --> 19:17.680
No, no. The candle popcorn smell.
Whatever you were feeling right now is it.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.600
(WHISPERS) Fear of being found out.
What?

19:21.760 --> 19:24.560
Nothing. I know where the tapestry is!

19:24.720 --> 19:27.360
Where?
The priest hole's open.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.000
(TARA)
Bridget?

19:30.120 --> 19:33.720
Bridget, are you there?
Please tell me you’re there!

19:33.880 --> 19:37.320
We have your essence, Budgie.
You’ll do as we please.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.360
Bridget! Please!

19:40.560 --> 19:45.120
Please, I’m leaving tomorrow.
I’m out of time. Give me a sign.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.880
(WHISPERS)

20:05.000 --> 20:08.440
(WHISPERS)

20:08.640 --> 20:11.760
(WHISPERS)

20:11.920 --> 20:16.520
Finally the Crossley girl
will be out of our way.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.600
Two Founders are missing.

20:22.640 --> 20:25.280
Tara! I know where the tapestry is.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.960
No! Stay away from the lantern!

20:34.720 --> 20:36.600
Otto!

20:37.680 --> 20:39.680
Next time on The Evermoor Chronicles.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.200
(BRIDGET) Is that who I think it is?
That is our opportunity

20:43.360 --> 20:47.280
to finally free our third sister.
I am so ready for earth.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.000
I've gathered you here today
for your safely.

20:50.120 --> 20:53.800
More Everines are missing.
If we don't fix Otto, we won't do anything

20:53.960 --> 20:56.640
apart from being banished.
Hand over the snoot.

20:56.800 --> 21:02.560
I will make sure you both spend
the rest of your lives unloved and alone.
