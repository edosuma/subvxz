02:09.401 --> 02:10.568
Oh!

03:01.491 --> 03:02.700
Come in.

03:04.661 --> 03:06.537
Mr. Feng, it's time.

03:07.163 --> 03:08.331
Ten thousand.

03:21.593 --> 03:22.802
Let's go.

03:22.802 --> 03:25.054
Here began the last bloody march

03:25.054 --> 03:26.639
toward Appomattox,

03:26.639 --> 03:30.518
where General Grant met
General Lee for the first time,

03:30.518 --> 03:33.604
and brave men bled to set
the course of history.

03:33.604 --> 03:37.065
I'm so honored to be here
celebrating the 150th anniversary

03:37.065 --> 03:38.692
of the Overland Campaign.

03:38.692 --> 03:40.777
Thank you to County
Administrator Roberts,

03:40.777 --> 03:42.987
to all the dedicated
re-enactors,

03:42.987 --> 03:45.156
and of course
to Governor O'Keefe

03:45.156 --> 03:48.951
for organizing such
a wonderful three-day event.

03:50.536 --> 03:53.163
- That's all, sir?
- That's it. Short and sweet.

03:53.163 --> 03:55.749
Or at least just short.

04:01.546 --> 04:04.215
In Gaffney, people called it
the War of Northern Aggression.

04:04.215 --> 04:06.759
I personally take no
pride in the Confederacy.

04:06.759 --> 04:09.428
Avoid wars you can't win,
and never raise your flag

04:09.428 --> 04:12.890
- for an asinine cause like slavery.
- He's on his way.

04:12.890 --> 04:14.349
Fine.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.523
- People will move on.
- They won't.

04:21.523 --> 04:24.859
- The less you say, the more they'll dig.
- Let them.

04:24.859 --> 04:30.531
- Willa, could you give us two seconds?
- I'll be right outside.

04:37.496 --> 04:40.081
McGinnis happened in college.

04:40.081 --> 04:43.209
The abortion
happened five years later.

04:43.209 --> 04:47.088
- There aren't any medical records.
- None at all?

04:47.088 --> 04:49.548
We specifically made sure.

04:49.548 --> 04:51.258
A nurse, somebody
in the waiting room?

04:51.258 --> 04:53.093
The doctor was
the only one there.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.345
- Then where is he now?
- It's a long time ago, Connor.

04:55.345 --> 05:00.100
He passed away.
And if I'm not worried, you shouldn't be.

05:00.100 --> 05:04.187
Even still, sexual assault is part
of the conversation now.

05:04.187 --> 05:06.147
Every article and column
mentions you.

05:06.147 --> 05:09.400
If we offer nothing,
we can't shape your image.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.860
I made it very clear,
I don't want exposure.

05:11.860 --> 05:15.239
When we have something
new to say, we'll say it.

05:16.615 --> 05:19.576
Willa? Any luck
with the Joint Chiefs?

05:19.576 --> 05:21.786
The chairman's office still
says he's unavailable.

05:21.786 --> 05:26.332
But they did offer to send the
director of the Joint Staff.

05:26.332 --> 05:28.626
- Eleven a.m. tomorrow.
- Confirm it.

05:28.626 --> 05:31.462
We'll meet in Francis's
office at the West Wing. Anything else?

05:31.462 --> 05:33.839
No. I should get going.
Hit the road.

05:33.839 --> 05:35.048
Thank you, Connor.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.885
Get Congresswoman Brooks
on the phone.

05:38.885 --> 05:43.640
And see if the First Lady
will be available this afternoon.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.184
You want a brief on everyone on the
Chinese side of the summit?

05:46.184 --> 05:50.938
No. What Durant's doing in Washington
is a facade. This is the real negotiation.

05:50.938 --> 05:53.649
Give me what you have on Feng.

05:53.649 --> 05:57.152
Xander Feng. Deep family
connections to the party.

05:57.152 --> 05:59.779
Grandfather fought
side by side with Mao.

05:59.779 --> 06:03.741
Big in the telecom industry.
Estimated net worth is over 50 billion.

06:03.741 --> 06:07.286
- More than Raymond's.
- By a few billion, but who's counting?

06:07.286 --> 06:09.789
Do they have any
other business partnerships

06:09.789 --> 06:12.499
- other than the rare earth refinery?
- Not that I could find.

06:12.499 --> 06:14.793
All right. Get a progress
update from Durant.

06:14.793 --> 06:17.587
Tell her I'll be in touch as soon
as we know what Feng wants.

06:19.297 --> 06:22.383
When a man like Raymond Tusk
gets involved in state diplomacy,

06:22.383 --> 06:24.635
you can be sure he's not
after the Nobel Peace Prize.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.513
He's an opportunist.
But so am I.

06:27.513 --> 06:32.601
Maybe this is my opportunity
to loosen his grip on the president.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.771
You must be the manager.
Thank you for having us. Good morning.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.106
Mr. Vice President,
do you have any idea how long...

06:38.106 --> 06:40.066
Any comments
on the talks with the Chinese?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.735
Can we get a
comment on the summit talks?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.611
The vice president will
be working from his room

06:43.611 --> 06:46.614
for the remainder of the day.
All day.

07:00.126 --> 07:03.463
Mr. Feng, it's a pleasure.

07:03.463 --> 07:05.423
Likewise,
Mr. Vice President.

07:07.925 --> 07:10.302
- Coffee? Tea?
- I have already been offered.

07:10.302 --> 07:12.846
- But thank you.
- Thank you, Meechum.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.811
It's a long flight from Beijing.
You must be exhausted.

07:19.811 --> 07:24.565
I keep Western hours.
My midnight is your midnight.

07:24.565 --> 07:27.735
So have you had a chance
to look over the proposal?

07:27.735 --> 07:29.987
- I have.
- Shall we?

07:29.987 --> 07:31.780
Page four.

07:34.116 --> 07:37.411
- The refinery.
- With Mr. Tusk.

07:37.411 --> 07:39.037
With the highest bidder.

07:40.914 --> 07:43.291
We are prepared to offer
Clayton West a 40-year lease

07:43.291 --> 07:48.587
on the Mei Mei rare earth elements
refinery, to which I will lend my name.

07:48.587 --> 07:50.923
I understand that you and
Raymond are business associates.

07:50.923 --> 07:53.675
But you're gonna have
to open it up to bidding.

07:53.675 --> 07:55.844
Mr. Tusk will outbid
any competitors.

07:55.844 --> 07:59.014
Well, even so, you know,
for appearances.

07:59.014 --> 08:02.767
Yes. Appearances.
If you must.

08:02.767 --> 08:06.979
- So there are no issues here, then?
- We may proceed.

08:06.979 --> 08:11.233
- Page six.
- The bridge.

08:11.233 --> 08:16.029
The committee on foreign investment
will approve a pilot infrastructure project

08:16.029 --> 08:19.991
to build a bridge over the
Long Island Sound from
Port Jefferson to Milford

08:19.991 --> 08:23.995
in exchange for a 25-year
toll-taking contract.

08:23.995 --> 08:28.040
Before we consider the bridge,
there's one more item I'd like to discuss.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.084
Consider? I thought
the bridge was definite.

08:30.084 --> 08:34.296
- Nothing is definite.
- This bridge is a priority-one item.

08:34.296 --> 08:38.633
It's very important to your
president. I understand.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.135
What would you like to discuss?

08:40.135 --> 08:42.345
The currency manipulation suit

08:42.345 --> 08:43.763
which you have filed against us

08:43.763 --> 08:45.890
in the World Trade Organization.

08:45.890 --> 08:50.394
Which we are prepared
to drop if all other conditions are met.

08:50.394 --> 08:52.813
The point of this meeting
is to allow us to say things

08:52.813 --> 08:54.940
that cannot be said
in formal settings, yes?

08:54.940 --> 08:58.527
- Yes, of course.
- We don't want you to drop the lawsuit.

08:58.527 --> 09:03.615
Forgive me, I...
I don't understand.

09:03.615 --> 09:07.493
Do not back off in the WTO.

09:07.493 --> 09:10.704
But you've been fighting us on
currency manipulation for years.

09:10.704 --> 09:12.748
Free-floating
currency is inevitable.

09:14.041 --> 09:15.792
Now I have something
I can work with.

09:17.127 --> 09:20.046
- Why the suddenn change of heart?
- Not sudden.

09:20.046 --> 09:22.549
It has taken those of us
who are more forward-thinking

09:22.549 --> 09:24.550
many years to convince
our counterparts.

09:24.550 --> 09:27.136
But China could just do it.
I mean, you know as well as I,

09:27.136 --> 09:30.848
- you don't require WTO ruling.
- Appearances, as you say.

09:30.848 --> 09:37.396
It's important that it looks like America
forced us out, not that we gave in.

09:37.396 --> 09:40.649
Well, I'll need a little
more time so that I can
brief the president.

09:40.649 --> 09:43.359
I'm here for
as long as necessary.

09:43.359 --> 09:46.237
However you would like to communicate,
I leave that to you.

09:46.237 --> 09:49.448
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.
- Thank you, Mr. Feng.

09:54.953 --> 09:58.707
In Gaffney, we had our
own brand of diplomacy:

09:58.707 --> 10:03.044
shake with your right hand,
but hold a rock in your left.

10:06.589 --> 10:08.507
Well, look who got
stuck with the pool.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.885
We volunteered
because we hate ourselves.

10:10.885 --> 10:14.471
- All's well on the Southern Front?
- No news is no news.

10:14.471 --> 10:16.723
Come on. I hear there's
muskets out there.

10:16.723 --> 10:18.517
When you giving us
something real?

10:18.517 --> 10:20.477
We're here in beautiful
Spotsylvania, aren't we?

10:20.477 --> 10:22.812
This is dress-up for
grown men with toy guns.

10:22.812 --> 10:25.982
Sounds like 500 words to me.

10:25.982 --> 10:30.402
Tell Durant that China won't discuss
the bridge unless we drop the WTO suit.

10:30.402 --> 10:32.488
I thought you said
they want to keep it?

10:32.488 --> 10:36.074
Feng does, which means Tusk does.
But we don't know if Beijing does.

10:36.074 --> 10:37.576
You think Feng's lying?

10:37.576 --> 10:39.327
An open currency could
free up interest rates,

10:39.327 --> 10:41.913
reduce inflation in China.
They both profit.

10:41.913 --> 10:43.915
If they're forcing
Beijing's hand, or we are,

10:43.915 --> 10:46.834
- that could throw the summit into chaos.
- Exactly.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.211
Look, Feng may
well have support,

10:49.211 --> 10:51.380
but my guess is that the
Standing Committee's divided.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.340
Either way, we'll
throw them off balance.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.716
Let's leak we're
dropping the suit

10:54.716 --> 10:56.635
as soon as Cathy presents it.

10:56.635 --> 10:59.179
Just the lawsuit?
Nothing else in the leak?

10:59.179 --> 11:02.515
A hint of Feng, but no names.
Let's let this grow on its own.

11:09.063 --> 11:11.732
- How was that?
- Much better.

11:11.732 --> 11:14.443
I feel good.
What do you think?

11:14.443 --> 11:16.987
- I think you're ready.
- How long on the code?

11:16.987 --> 11:18.613
Just a couple of bugs
to work out.

11:18.613 --> 11:20.490
I told them tomorrow
or Wednesday.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.700
- Work's not done.
- If I postpone again,

11:22.700 --> 11:25.411
- don't you think it'll draw attention?
- It'll be done when it's done.

11:25.411 --> 11:27.538
I'll email you when
the bugs are fixed.

11:27.538 --> 11:30.666
Somewhere public.
Place and time.

11:33.919 --> 11:37.422
Hey. Are you sure you
want to do this?

11:37.422 --> 11:40.342
- I understand the risks.
- Well, you think you do.

11:40.342 --> 11:42.135
This isn't the first time
I've been in danger.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.761
Oh, yeah?
Paper cuts at the <i> Herald?</i>

11:43.761 --> 11:46.347
Death threats. When I
exposed a drug ring in DC.

11:46.347 --> 11:48.724
No, I read the articles.
That's small-time.

11:48.724 --> 11:51.560
I almost had to go
into protection.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.730
This is the FBI.
It's not a few street cops.

11:54.730 --> 12:00.652
You think you're badass because
you're on some vigilante anarchy kick?

12:00.652 --> 12:03.488
At least I have the balls
to put my name on the work I do.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.993
You've never faced a hundred
years in prison, you self-righteous prick.

12:08.993 --> 12:12.413
Most of my friends are locked up
and rotting away 'cause they poked the bear

12:12.413 --> 12:14.248
one too many times. Why?

12:14.248 --> 12:17.584
They wanted to expose government
surveillance, the PRISM program,

12:17.584 --> 12:21.296
embezzlement, abuse,
fucking torture, lies.

12:21.296 --> 12:24.924
You're a journalist? Who gives
a shit? We're fucking soldiers.

12:27.927 --> 12:31.180
It's personal for me now.

12:31.180 --> 12:34.057
I don't have a choice,
but you still do.

12:37.352 --> 12:39.938
I don't have a choice.

12:44.484 --> 12:48.529
- Where did you get this? - You can say
a source close to the Chinese delegation.

12:48.529 --> 12:50.447
- Give me a name.
- All I know is that it's

12:50.447 --> 12:52.574
a Chinese businessman with
ties to the Standing Committee.

12:52.574 --> 12:54.576
- Back-channeling the summit.
- In Washington?

12:54.576 --> 12:56.328
- I don't know.
- With who?

12:56.328 --> 12:58.997
- I don't know that either.
- If I called the USTR's office,

12:58.997 --> 13:02.834
- they'll confirm?
- I'm telling you as much as I know.

13:02.834 --> 13:04.919
Why are you telling me
this at all?

13:04.919 --> 13:07.380
They're going public with it tomorrow.
You might as well get the scoop.

13:07.380 --> 13:09.256
Why me specifically?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.467
You deserve better
than a Civil War reenactment.

13:11.467 --> 13:15.012
Please don't pretend you've suddenly
become Santa Claus.

13:16.430 --> 13:18.473
I give you something now,
maybe you remember.

13:18.473 --> 13:22.060
- It's an investment in the future.
- I'm not big on favors.

13:23.269 --> 13:24.520
I said "maybe."

13:30.693 --> 13:33.195
Connect me to the USTR's office.
Skip the press secretary.

13:33.195 --> 13:35.030
Tell them I want
to talk about the WTO suit.

13:35.030 --> 13:37.365
- Who did you speak to?
- Connor.

13:37.365 --> 13:40.785
- He's talking to Ayla Sayyad.
- How much did you fill him in?

13:44.038 --> 13:46.457
- The bare minimum.
- I'd be a lot more comfortable

13:46.457 --> 13:48.793
if it was you going directly,
as we discussed.

13:48.793 --> 13:51.837
This puts distance on me,
which puts distance on you.

13:51.837 --> 13:54.214
I want you to meet with Feng
tonight. No proxies.

13:54.214 --> 13:57.217
- Understood.
- Now where are we with Mr. Goodwin?

13:57.217 --> 13:59.719
Any day now.
Thirty-five to life.

14:02.180 --> 14:05.600
Cyberterrorism.
The penalties are stiff.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.768
- This needs to be clean, Doug.
- It will be.

14:09.145 --> 14:11.814
One fall of the axe.

14:11.814 --> 14:14.858
- Keep me informed.
- Yes, sir.

14:17.652 --> 14:20.405
Well, I just think what
you did took so much bravery.

14:20.405 --> 14:24.242
To go on air like that in front of
the whole country and say what you did?

14:24.242 --> 14:26.452
That means a lot to me.

14:26.452 --> 14:30.456
And I admire what you both have been
doing to advocate for the, well,

14:30.456 --> 14:34.001
- for the victims.
- Women. Like you and me.

14:34.001 --> 14:37.546
- Not victims.
- Men too. It's not gender-specific.

14:37.546 --> 14:40.173
Well, yes.

14:40.173 --> 14:45.845
- Would you consider pitching in?
- How?

14:45.845 --> 14:51.016
It would send a strong message if
we had the First Lady in our corner.

14:51.016 --> 14:56.063
- If you think I could help. - Well, we
have thehead of the women's caucus.

14:56.063 --> 14:58.023
Both wives from the White House.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.859
That's a meeting they couldn't
sweep under the rug.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.695
And the fact that the chairman
sent anyone is promising,

15:03.695 --> 15:06.531
but we need to make sure
our message gets back to him.

15:06.531 --> 15:11.202
I just... I haven't been through
the same sort of experience.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.536
Well, why should
that prevent you?

15:12.536 --> 15:14.079
I don't know if I have a right

15:14.079 --> 15:16.873
- to speak about it.
- You're the First Lady.

15:16.873 --> 15:20.669
You have the right to speak
about anything you want.

15:22.086 --> 15:24.047
- Mr. White?
- Mrs. Marbury.

15:24.047 --> 15:26.591
- I'm Susan.
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

15:26.591 --> 15:30.678
I know I'm a little off the beaten path.
Did you have any trouble finding me?

15:30.678 --> 15:33.180
No, the directions were great.
Easy as pie.

15:33.180 --> 15:36.725
Well, good. Come in.

15:38.727 --> 15:42.897
I have to admit, I've been
looking forward to this all day.

15:42.897 --> 15:45.775
I didn't realize you were
announcing so soon.

15:45.775 --> 15:47.985
We've had some great luck
with the endowment.

15:47.985 --> 15:52.323
Well, my husband didn't get much
recognition while he was alive.

15:52.323 --> 15:57.244
I was so thrilled when Planned Parenthood
asked to name a fund after him.

15:57.244 --> 15:59.955
We're thrilled that
you're open to it.

15:59.955 --> 16:02.916
When you called, you said
you had some questions?

16:02.916 --> 16:05.585
They're delicate. That's why
I wanted to come in person.

16:05.585 --> 16:09.338
- Delicate how? - There are
a lot of people who will protest

16:09.338 --> 16:11.715
this sort of financial
assistance to minors.

16:11.715 --> 16:14.676
And we want to make sure
they have no cause to smear us.

16:14.676 --> 16:18.346
People tried to smear my
husband his entire career.

16:18.346 --> 16:21.724
He never let it affect
the work he was doing.

16:21.724 --> 16:24.560
Did your husband ever perform
any illegal abortions?

16:27.813 --> 16:30.941
I need you to answer me,
Mrs. Marbury.

16:30.941 --> 16:33.360
Did your husband
perform any illegal abortions?

16:33.360 --> 16:35.571
I won't discuss that.

16:35.571 --> 16:38.740
- Nothing unreported?
- Young man.

16:38.740 --> 16:43.244
You're not old enough to remember,
but there was a time when every...

16:43.244 --> 16:48.457
What about any prominent figures
who the antichoice crowd could vilify?

16:48.457 --> 16:52.336
- No. - Did Dr. Marbury perform an
abortion for Claire Underwood?

16:52.336 --> 16:56.465
- No, he did not.
- I know for a fact that he did.

16:56.465 --> 17:01.344
That is not true. And I
would like you to leave now.

17:01.344 --> 17:07.058
Forgive me, Mrs. Marbury.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.

17:07.058 --> 17:11.895
My name's Seth Grayson.
I don't work for Planned Parenthood.

17:13.564 --> 17:14.815
Mr. Feng?

17:17.567 --> 17:21.237
There's speculation back home
that the back channel is you.

17:21.237 --> 17:23.196
Two separate
articles in Hong Kong...

17:24.073 --> 17:25.867
there's your name.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.617
Do you want me
to contact the vice president?

17:28.452 --> 17:32.873
No. Let him come to me.

17:32.873 --> 17:35.542
Get Mr. Tusk on the phone.

17:39.546 --> 17:41.589
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

17:41.589 --> 17:44.467
I'm doing this for your
own good, Mrs. Marbury.

17:44.467 --> 17:49.013
Imagine the media frenzy,
your husband's legacy destroyed,

17:49.013 --> 17:52.516
the press hounding you
day and night,

17:52.516 --> 17:55.727
and the Planned
Parenthood fund... gone.

17:55.727 --> 17:57.979
How do I know you work for her?

17:57.979 --> 18:01.483
That you're not just some
right-wing fanatic who wants to destroy...

18:01.483 --> 18:05.445
Because I wouldn't have done
you the courtesy of paying a visit.

18:05.445 --> 18:11.909
There would've been an army of satellite
trucks at your door instead of me.

18:11.909 --> 18:15.203
Well, I won't tell anyone,
if that's what you're worried about.

18:15.203 --> 18:19.165
I believe you.

18:19.165 --> 18:22.335
Did your husband keep records
of any kind of who he assisted?

18:22.335 --> 18:25.880
Anything at all? Notes?
Unofficial records?

18:25.880 --> 18:29.592
- He kept a journal.
- Do you still have it?

18:44.564 --> 18:48.609
- May I?
- Go ahead.

18:51.445 --> 18:56.158
- I need to take this with me.
- Can't you just take out that page?

18:56.158 --> 19:00.912
Someone finds this with pages
missing, that could raise eyebrows.

19:00.912 --> 19:03.873
There's 60 years
of his life in there.

19:03.873 --> 19:07.543
From when we met until he died.

19:07.543 --> 19:11.672
And do you want six decades
reduced to one night in August,

19:11.672 --> 19:15.342
25 years ago?

19:15.342 --> 19:17.511
Just imagine what it
looked like back then.

19:17.511 --> 19:19.512
At the edge of the ridge was
a dense thicket which allowed

19:19.512 --> 19:23.433
the Northern troops to come in
and form on the Mule Shoe.

19:23.433 --> 19:27.353
The Southern regiments were entrenched
in this area at the apex of the line.

19:27.353 --> 19:32.066
As you can see, the topography forced
the two sides down towards each other.

19:32.066 --> 19:34.902
- This is the Bloody Angle?
- That's right.

19:34.902 --> 19:36.486
I was reading
about it last night.

19:36.486 --> 19:38.405
Close quarters,
hand-to-hand combat.

19:38.405 --> 19:42.450
All told, about 15,000
Union and Confederate soldiers

19:42.450 --> 19:44.452
lost their lives here
at the Bloody Angle

19:44.452 --> 19:47.330
on a battlefield that's
only about half a mile wide.

19:47.330 --> 19:50.499
Now, Mr. Vice President,
we have a surprise for you today.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.919
I'd like to introduce you to
Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood

19:53.919 --> 19:56.338
of the 12th Regiment
of McGowan's Brigade,

19:56.338 --> 19:58.840
your
great-great-great-grandfather.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.427
- I died here, in this battle.
- I think there's been a mistake.

20:02.427 --> 20:05.304
My grandfather never mentioned
any Underwoods in the war.

20:05.304 --> 20:07.556
We did our research. He
definitely fought and died here.

20:07.556 --> 20:11.435
I was 24. And my son,
your great-great-grandfather,

20:11.435 --> 20:13.604
was two years old.
I never met him.

20:13.604 --> 20:16.064
It happened here?
At the Bloody Angle?

20:16.064 --> 20:19.859
At the edge of those woods.
My skull was bashed in with a rock.

20:19.859 --> 20:22.779
Thank you.
Now, over here,

20:22.779 --> 20:25.615
we've got something that's
very interesting as well.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.575
Just a moment.

20:32.079 --> 20:35.457
- Tell me more.
- It was the middle of the night.

20:35.457 --> 20:37.501
We were out of musket balls.

20:37.501 --> 20:40.587
Just bayonets, and only
half of us had those.

20:40.587 --> 20:44.549
I had nothing.
Just these hands.

20:44.549 --> 20:48.386
So dark you
couldn't see nothin'.

20:48.386 --> 20:50.930
But you could hear 'em,
the Yanks, running toward us.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.057
Then you could smell 'em.

20:53.057 --> 20:55.767
First Yank that brushed up against me,
I grabbed him by the throat.

20:55.767 --> 21:01.439
Fall down on the ground.
I bit him so hard I could taste the bone.

21:03.483 --> 21:07.194
Then he grabs a rock, brings it down
right here. That was that.

21:07.194 --> 21:10.739
I was buried in a mass grave.
No headstone.

21:10.739 --> 21:12.616
Can we get a picture
with you and Augustus?

21:13.450 --> 21:15.244
Yes.

21:21.875 --> 21:23.626
Thank you.

21:28.547 --> 21:33.343
- He takes it rather seriously.
- Oh, yeah, they all do.

21:33.343 --> 21:38.098
Now up ahead we have examples
of Confederate ramparts
that we've reconstructed.

21:38.098 --> 21:40.809
You can see how they've cut the timber
and made the trenches.

21:40.809 --> 21:43.936
Those trenches traded hands many times
over the course of the battle.

21:48.024 --> 21:51.527
- You have keys?
- We own you. Yes, we have keys.

21:51.527 --> 21:54.112
- Let me put some clothes on.
- Forget your clothes.

21:54.112 --> 21:57.032
And I quote:
"You sure you wanna do this?"

21:57.032 --> 22:00.076
And I quote: "I don't
have a choice, but you do."

22:00.076 --> 22:01.995
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

22:01.995 --> 22:04.205
He should know what
he's getting into.

22:05.915 --> 22:08.459
Are those silk pajamas?

22:11.170 --> 22:13.505
Looks even fancier in person.

22:16.466 --> 22:18.385
Cashew.

22:20.261 --> 22:22.180
No. Don't touch her.

22:22.180 --> 22:26.267
Hey, there, little guy.

22:29.186 --> 22:32.606
I've seen you before on camera.

22:32.606 --> 22:35.400
Please put her down.

22:40.572 --> 22:44.450
Don't take the chance.

22:44.450 --> 22:47.912
I bought these shoes at J.C.
Penney. Seventy-two dollars with tax.

22:47.912 --> 22:50.831
Rubber soles.
Can clean 'em off with a hose.

22:50.831 --> 22:52.708
Please, you're hurting her.

22:52.708 --> 22:56.878
I have a pet too.
His name is Gavin Orsay.

22:56.878 --> 22:58.547
Sit!

23:01.925 --> 23:03.926
I said sit.

23:11.308 --> 23:13.435
Look what a good boy
you are, Gavin.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.655
- Is that what you need me to do?
- Quiet.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.990
When I say fetch, you fetch.

23:27.990 --> 23:31.660
And now we are going to fetch
Lucas, just like we discussed.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.040
If you try to bite my hand,

23:37.040 --> 23:39.292
I will put you to sleep.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.714
Mind if I take a couple?

24:02.105 --> 24:05.066
Doug Stamper. I'm the vice
president's chief of staff.

24:05.066 --> 24:09.028
I know. Sit down.

24:09.028 --> 24:12.072
My grandfather fought
in the revolution.

24:12.072 --> 24:16.118
China was poor then.
Sugar was hard to come by.

24:16.118 --> 24:18.954
Now, sugar
is everywhere in China.

24:21.289 --> 24:24.751
- Do you like Old Fashioneds?
- No, thanks.

24:25.626 --> 24:27.920
I've seen the news.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.631
Your government was enthusiastic about
us dropping the suit.

24:30.631 --> 24:32.966
They've touted it as
a victory back home.

24:32.966 --> 24:36.386
It is a victory.
But not the victory we wanted.

24:36.386 --> 24:38.263
We're finding that
difficult to believe.

24:38.263 --> 24:40.348
By "we" you mean
the vice president.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.016
I mean the American government.

24:42.016 --> 24:43.810
Which he proclaims to represent.

24:43.810 --> 24:46.646
He does.
And I'm representing him.

24:46.646 --> 24:49.398
Don't inflate your status,
Mr. Stamper.

24:49.398 --> 24:52.192
You're nothing
but an errand boy.

24:52.192 --> 24:54.820
Do you have a message
for the vice president?

24:54.820 --> 24:56.988
If he represents
the American government,

24:56.988 --> 24:59.241
then why did he fail
to communicate my request?

24:59.241 --> 25:01.618
We question your legitimacy,
Mr. Feng.

25:01.618 --> 25:07.039
Nothing your delegation has done or said
has in any way supported your requests.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.378
Mm... Smell that.

25:12.378 --> 25:18.425
I use Macallan Rare and Fine,
1926. Forty thousand dollars a bottle.

25:18.425 --> 25:22.554
- You used to be an alcoholic, correct?
- Not used to be. Still am.

25:22.554 --> 25:26.307
- A sober one.
- Do you miss it?

25:28.893 --> 25:31.520
- Five thousand dollars you just spilled.
- I'll send you a check.

25:31.520 --> 25:36.900
I like you, Mr. Stamper, even if you're
just an errand boy.

25:36.900 --> 25:41.488
I'll ask you again. What is your
message for the vice president?

25:41.488 --> 25:45.074
There will be no Port Jefferson
Bridge unless the lawsuit is reintroduced.

25:45.074 --> 25:48.869
When you do, there will be those
on the Standing Committee who protest,

25:48.869 --> 25:53.332
but I'll manage them.
The majority want reform.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.461
I'll tell the vice president.

25:57.461 --> 26:00.338
Mr. Stamper, one more message.

26:00.338 --> 26:03.132
Please remind the vice president
that we are both here at the behest

26:03.132 --> 26:05.009
of our mutual friend, Mr. Tusk.

26:06.511 --> 26:08.179
If the vice president
fails to cooperate,

26:08.179 --> 26:09.638
I will simply bypass him.

26:16.436 --> 26:20.440
- Yes?
- It's Doug.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.025
Fine.

26:24.610 --> 26:28.489
Spoke with Feng.
Here's your onion rings.

26:28.489 --> 26:33.494
Did you know that General
Longstreet was shot here?

26:33.494 --> 26:36.872
Accidentally by his
own men in the dark?

26:36.872 --> 26:39.082
No, I didn't.

26:42.377 --> 26:45.379
All right. Bring me up to date.
Where are we with Feng?

26:45.379 --> 26:48.215
He wants us to
resume the lawsuit.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.259
So he's sticking to his guns.

26:50.259 --> 26:52.928
If we don't reintroduce it,
there's no bridge project.

26:52.928 --> 26:55.430
Well, that will greatly
upset the president.

26:55.430 --> 26:58.099
Do you want me to
deliver Feng's message?

26:58.099 --> 27:00.894
Absolutely not.

27:00.894 --> 27:02.896
We want the president angry.

27:02.896 --> 27:07.316
The tricky part is making sure
he doesn't direct it toward me.

27:07.316 --> 27:10.778
- So, what do you want me to do?
- Get ahold of Cathy's people.

27:10.778 --> 27:16.408
Do not mention the lawsuit at all.
Have them bring up the bridge instead.

27:16.408 --> 27:19.869
- Let's see if Feng is bluffing.
- Yes, sir.

27:22.413 --> 27:26.250
We must learn from Longstreet.
He rode too high in the saddle.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.170
If a bullet comes my way
tomorrow, it will not be an accident,

27:29.170 --> 27:32.006
and I must be quick to duck.

27:36.134 --> 27:38.053
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

27:38.053 --> 27:40.263
Is the vice president attending?

27:40.263 --> 27:42.307
No, he's not. He's out of town.

27:42.307 --> 27:46.185
I've just decided to use his office
because it's a bit bigger than mine.

27:46.185 --> 27:48.104
Please, sit.

27:51.232 --> 27:54.776
I know this isn't the first conversation
you've had about sexual assault.

27:54.776 --> 27:58.363
We've had a very open dialogue with
the congresswoman for quite some time.

27:58.363 --> 28:02.742
"Open" is one way to put it. I think the
Joint Chiefs have tolerated my concerns...

28:02.742 --> 28:05.620
To be fair, we've been quite responsive.
Over the past two years...

28:05.620 --> 28:08.247
The congresswoman has
expressed her frustration to me

28:08.247 --> 28:11.709
- that there's still room for improvement.
- Mrs. Underwood, if I may.

28:11.709 --> 28:16.296
- Please. - This is an issue
we've grappled with seriously.

28:16.296 --> 28:18.340
Increased education
and prevention measures,

28:18.340 --> 28:20.633
restructuring
the reporting process,

28:20.633 --> 28:23.303
insulating courts-martial
from abuse of power.

28:23.303 --> 28:27.682
- It's still not enough. - Civilian
jurisdiction is not gonna happen.

28:27.682 --> 28:34.730
We're all aware that's what
the congresswoman would prefer,
but we won't allow our...

28:34.730 --> 28:36.815
- Am I late?
- It's my fault.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.859
The meeting got pushed up.
I meant to e-mail you. I'm very sorry.

28:39.859 --> 28:43.029
That's fine. Please, sit.

28:43.029 --> 28:45.031
We didn't know you'd be
attending, Mrs. Walker.

28:45.031 --> 28:48.284
I'm sorry for interrupting.
Continue.

28:48.284 --> 28:51.120
As I was saying...

28:51.120 --> 28:55.415
...putting sexual assault cases
entirely in the hands of civilian courts

28:55.415 --> 29:00.420
fundamentally erodes
the military's ability to self-discipline.

29:00.420 --> 29:04.632
What about civilian oversight
instead of civilian courts?

29:04.632 --> 29:06.425
That's a slippery slope.

29:06.425 --> 29:09.095
There were those who
said the same of racial integration.

29:09.095 --> 29:11.847
Integration didn't
change the core operational nature...

29:11.847 --> 29:14.975
But it did prove that the military
could shape its own evolution.

29:14.975 --> 29:17.185
Absolutely. But in this case,

29:17.185 --> 29:19.437
civilian oversight
is not the answer.

29:19.437 --> 29:22.815
My husband is a
civilian who oversees the military.

29:22.815 --> 29:26.152
Are you suggesting that
civilians can offer no guidance

29:26.152 --> 29:29.321
- in matters like this?
- Forgive me, Mrs. Walker.

29:29.321 --> 29:30.990
I didn't mean
to suggest that at all.

29:30.990 --> 29:32.950
Then maybe you should
listen to the civilian

29:32.950 --> 29:39.789
- sitting across from you.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:39.789 --> 29:42.959
This is from your own sexual
assault prevention literature.

29:42.959 --> 29:45.503
And in it, it says

29:45.503 --> 29:52.051
in some cases it may
be advisable to submit than to resist.

29:52.051 --> 29:56.722
I think it's quite clear that
there's still room for improvement.

30:02.519 --> 30:05.063
Did you know about Xander Feng?

30:05.063 --> 30:07.231
Not until I saw his name
on the wire.

30:07.231 --> 30:10.734
He's been charged with corruption twice.
Both times, the charges were dropped.

30:10.734 --> 30:12.861
Do you know what happens in
China if you're convicted?

30:12.861 --> 30:14.947
- I'm guessing it's not good.
- You die.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.740
- There you go.
- We're talking about a man

30:16.740 --> 30:18.950
who's only one kangaroo court
away from lethal injection,

30:18.950 --> 30:23.121
who's filthy rich and clearly corrupt,
and this is who the Chinese send?

30:23.121 --> 30:25.456
- You are asking the wrong guy.
- Stop dodging.

30:25.456 --> 30:28.542
I passed a note in class.
That's all.

30:30.669 --> 30:32.087
<i>We placed</i>
<i>our faith in you, Frank.</i>

30:32.087 --> 30:34.089
We still have the rest
of the day

30:34.089 --> 30:37.050
- and all of tomorrow, Mr. President.
- <i> I need this bridge.</i>

30:37.050 --> 30:39.970
<i>Otherwise we have to stall</i>
<i>my infrastructure program.</i>

30:39.970 --> 30:42.138
No foreign investment,
no deficit reduction.

30:42.138 --> 30:44.891
<i>And the Chinese know this.
They're using it for leverage.</i>

30:44.891 --> 30:46.809
- Yeah, but for what?
- <i> That I'm not sure of.</i>

30:46.809 --> 30:48.978
Then why did we send you
to Spotsylvania, Frank?

30:48.978 --> 30:50.854
<i>You're supposed to have answers</i>
<i>to these questions.</i>

30:50.854 --> 30:53.774
<i>Mr. President, I spoke</i>
<i>to Mr. Feng an hour ago.</i>

30:53.774 --> 30:55.400
<i>- What'd he say?</i>
- Here comes the bullet.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.569
<i>He claims that Frank hasn't been</i>

30:57.569 --> 30:59.321
<i>delivering</i>
<i>his messages properly.</i>

30:59.321 --> 31:02.782
I have conveyed
his requests word for word.

31:02.782 --> 31:04.992
<i>He says you've been</i>
<i>doing the opposite.</i>

31:04.992 --> 31:07.036
Who is responsible for
the back-channeling here?

31:07.036 --> 31:09.413
<i>- Me or Raymond?</i>
- You are, Frank.

31:09.413 --> 31:11.832
I'm simply here to facilitate,
not negotiate.

31:11.832 --> 31:14.168
<i>And yet you continue</i>
<i>to have private conversations</i>

31:14.168 --> 31:16.670
<i>- with Beijing's supposed emissary.</i>
- Listen, Frank...

31:16.670 --> 31:19.839
<i>Are you prepared to trust Mr.
Feng's word over mine, Raymond?</i>

31:19.839 --> 31:21.633
No one is doubting
your word, Frank.

31:21.633 --> 31:23.885
<i>If Feng is truly representing</i>
<i>his government's interests,</i>

31:23.885 --> 31:26.554
why is he telling Raymond
one thing and telling me another?

31:26.554 --> 31:28.639
<i>How do you explain the</i>
<i>bridge falling through?</i>

31:28.639 --> 31:31.558
He personally profits
from a free-floating currency.

31:31.558 --> 31:35.395
Just as anyone would who's in business
with him, such as yourself, Raymond.

31:35.395 --> 31:39.190
The refinery and the bridge
are two completely different issues.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.651
Let's keep our focus here.
I want the bridge

31:41.651 --> 31:43.653
back on the table.
End of story. Catherine?

31:43.653 --> 31:46.072
<i>It'll be the first item I bring up</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

31:46.072 --> 31:49.241
<i>Frank, stay put for</i>
<i>now. But don't contact Feng.</i>

31:49.241 --> 31:50.784
<i>And that goes for you too,</i>
<i>Raymond.</i>

31:50.784 --> 31:53.412
I don't want any more back-channeling
until the bridge is revived.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.997
And Catherine, you communicate

31:54.997 --> 31:56.790
- directly with me.
- Yes, sir.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.542
We're done here.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.753
The first drops of blood
have been spilt.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.838
Bullet grazed my cheek,
but I haven't fallen.

32:03.838 --> 32:06.090
Doug, find me a way
to meet Feng.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.718
- We need to discuss something first.
- What's wrong?

32:08.718 --> 32:11.971
I just got off the phone
with a guy named Seth Grayson.

32:17.476 --> 32:20.437
- I've spoken to my husband.
- Doug told me.

32:20.437 --> 32:23.022
- Thank you for fitting me in today.
- Is that it?

32:23.022 --> 32:26.943
- August '86.
- And why should we trust you?

32:26.943 --> 32:29.487
There was evidence that
Connor didn't make disappear.

32:29.487 --> 32:33.365
I could've taken this to <i> Us Weekly</i>
and bought a new house.

32:33.365 --> 32:36.660
Instead, I brought it to you.

32:36.660 --> 32:40.455
And why didn't you apply when I was
interviewing candidates?

32:40.455 --> 32:45.418
There was no point. Willa doesn't
like me. I intimidate her.

32:45.418 --> 32:48.254
That journal is my
version of a résumé.

32:49.964 --> 32:52.383
Or extortion.

32:52.383 --> 32:54.927
I'm not extorting you,
Mrs. Underwood. I'm just...

32:54.927 --> 32:58.805
...highlighting the difference between
a good choice and the right choice.

32:58.805 --> 33:03.101
And tell me, how would we handle the
repercussions of firing our comm director

33:03.101 --> 33:06.896
- three months after we hire him?
- You don't fire him.

33:06.896 --> 33:11.150
You tell him that you're bringing me
on board to help with the workload.

33:11.150 --> 33:13.277
He stays on with you,
I cover your husband.

33:13.277 --> 33:15.320
Connor will hate
working with me.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.280
I'll arrange a job offer
elsewhere in a few months.

33:17.280 --> 33:20.867
By the time it comes in,
he'll want to move on.

33:22.785 --> 33:26.873
Connor knows. What's to prevent him
from going public?

33:26.873 --> 33:31.961
I can handle Connor Ellis. You just have
to take me on my word on that.

33:34.922 --> 33:37.466
Here's what I know.

33:37.466 --> 33:42.428
It is far easier
for you to destroy me

33:42.428 --> 33:44.597
than the other way around.

33:48.017 --> 33:53.355
- I have to speak to my husband.
- Of course.

33:58.568 --> 34:02.363
I didn't make any copies.
You have the only one.

34:21.922 --> 34:24.759
Johnnie Walker Black. Neat.

34:26.636 --> 34:30.472
- Where is it?
- It's in my pocket.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.516
Come on.

34:34.851 --> 34:36.853
- Is something up?
- No. We're good to go.

34:36.853 --> 34:38.480
You seem nervous.

34:38.480 --> 34:40.190
Just because I've been breaking
the law for 20 years

34:40.190 --> 34:42.567
doesn't mean I don't
still get nervous.

34:43.693 --> 34:46.112
- Gavin...
- Do not say my name.

34:46.112 --> 34:47.862
Look at me.

34:52.034 --> 34:54.911
This is gonna be fine.
We've practiced. I'm confident.

34:54.911 --> 34:57.414
This is gonna work.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.347
I got your drink.

35:28.025 --> 35:30.486
He's more than qualified.

35:30.486 --> 35:32.988
<i>What do your instincts tell you?</i>

35:32.988 --> 35:35.866
That I just don't want
to end up more exposed.

35:35.866 --> 35:39.786
<i>Well, Grayson already knows.</i>
<i>I mean, we don't exhibit some degree...</i>

35:39.786 --> 35:43.289
Have Doug look into him.
Let's see if there's some leverage.

35:43.289 --> 35:46.876
Yeah, but we don't know what
he'll find or when or what
he'll do in the meantime.

35:46.876 --> 35:49.128
And that puts us
into uncharted territory.

35:49.128 --> 35:51.964
<i>Connor will expose us</i>
<i>too if we let him go.</i>

35:51.964 --> 35:53.424
Not if it goes smoothly.

35:53.424 --> 35:54.925
<i>If we turn away Grayson now,</i>

35:54.925 --> 35:56.802
<i>we can't predict anything.</i>

35:56.802 --> 35:59.721
<i>And look, he has a lot less</i>
<i>to lose than we do.</i>

36:01.681 --> 36:03.683
OK.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.977
I just, I don't think
we can trust him, Francis.

36:05.977 --> 36:08.604
<i>We wouldn't be having this conversation
if Connor had done his job.</i>

36:08.604 --> 36:11.523
<i>I'd rather manage someone</i>
<i>I don't trust than someone who's reckless.</i>

36:11.523 --> 36:13.525
Fine. What's the next step?

36:13.525 --> 36:15.235
<i>I'd like to talk</i>
<i>to Grayson myself first.</i>

36:15.235 --> 36:17.779
And then I'll have
Doug talk to Connor.

36:17.779 --> 36:21.241
<i>- How are you doing?</i>
- You been following the news?

36:21.241 --> 36:24.369
<i>- Is it bad for us or good?</i>
- Could go either way.

36:24.369 --> 36:28.331
<i>- I'm here if you need me.</i>
- I'm back tomorrow.

36:29.623 --> 36:32.835
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

36:35.921 --> 36:38.131
- We all set?
- All set, sir.

36:38.131 --> 36:39.966
Let's go.

36:57.899 --> 37:02.195
No, no. Turn those off.
Turn those off.

37:02.195 --> 37:05.490
- Where is he?
- Right this way, sir.

37:49.530 --> 37:52.449
- Did Augustus play?
- I like to think I did.

37:53.408 --> 37:54.701
What's your name?

37:54.701 --> 37:56.453
When I'm here,
I'm Augustus Underwood.

37:56.453 --> 37:59.956
- What's your real name?
- Doesn't this feel real to you?

37:59.956 --> 38:04.961
Will you show me where he died?
The exact spot.

38:07.463 --> 38:09.006
I will, sir.

38:14.595 --> 38:19.766
I'm gonna pay respects to my ancestor.
I would appreciate a little privacy.

38:19.766 --> 38:22.936
- We'll wait here.
- Little John on the move.

38:25.771 --> 38:31.068
- Just beyond those trees.
- Thank you. I'll be good from here.

38:49.376 --> 38:53.005
We're fine.

38:53.005 --> 38:56.425
- I hope you haven't waited long.
- It's peaceful here.

38:56.425 --> 39:02.388
- I didn't mind. - Peaceful now. Fifteen
thousand men died in these woods.

39:02.388 --> 39:05.433
My grandfather's grandfather
died where we're standing.

39:05.433 --> 39:09.562
- My grandfather was killed
in the revolution. - So I've heard.

39:13.065 --> 39:15.275
Do you fear death,
Mr. Vice President?

39:15.275 --> 39:17.694
No more or less than any man.

39:17.694 --> 39:21.364
It motivates me,
to experience everything.

39:21.364 --> 39:23.324
Accomplish all I can
before it all vanishes.

39:23.324 --> 39:26.160
I think you and I are
similar in that regard.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.954
Then why are we working
at cross-purposes?

39:28.954 --> 39:34.585
What you mean is, why am I not
submitting to you and Mr. Tusk?

39:34.585 --> 39:36.211
You are sabotaging
the negotiations.

39:36.211 --> 39:39.297
And you're using them
for your own personal ends.

39:39.297 --> 39:42.050
Wrong. It's taken me
seven years to convince

39:42.050 --> 39:44.218
the Standing Committee
that this was the right course of action.

39:44.218 --> 39:47.888
A course of action that will
earn you and Tusk billions.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.432
Why did you want this meeting,
just to attack me?

39:51.433 --> 39:53.352
To send a message to Raymond.

39:53.352 --> 39:56.355
The president of the United States and
I are not his puppets.

39:56.355 --> 39:58.064
Now, you tell him that.

39:58.064 --> 40:01.526
Fine. The bridge deal is dead.
There will be no saving it.

40:01.526 --> 40:06.155
Stick a knife through its heart and put
an apple in its mouth. I won't shed a tear.

40:06.155 --> 40:09.700
- Your president will ascribe
the failure to you. - I'll take the risk.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.577
Think strategically,
Mr. Vice President.

40:11.577 --> 40:13.745
You're setting us
on a very dangerous course.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.670
Do you know how Grant
defeated Lee?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.173
He had more men.
That's all.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.842
And he was willing
to let them die.

40:27.842 --> 40:31.428
It was butchery, not strategy,
which won the war.

40:31.428 --> 40:34.473
Mr. Tusk and I have great
resources at our disposal.

40:34.473 --> 40:39.894
Add up all your billions together
and you get the GDP of Slovakia.

40:39.894 --> 40:43.273
I have the federal government
of the United States of America.

40:43.273 --> 40:45.733
Your money
doesn't intimidate me.

40:45.733 --> 40:48.736
The most that you can buy
is influence.

40:48.736 --> 40:52.531
But I wield
constitutional authority.

40:52.531 --> 40:55.325
The strongest army
doesn't always win.

40:55.325 --> 40:57.244
Mao started out
with only a few thousand men.

40:57.244 --> 40:59.663
They took over half a continent.

40:59.663 --> 41:01.289
Mao is dead.

41:01.289 --> 41:04.250
- And so is his China.
- But I'm not.

41:05.251 --> 41:07.586
Not yet.

41:07.586 --> 41:11.674
Don't forget, your ancestor
fought for the losing side.

41:11.674 --> 41:14.176
There is no sacred ground
for the conquered.

41:32.901 --> 41:36.738
We have over 9,000 servers here,
utilized by several hundred clients.

41:36.738 --> 41:40.200
Everything from small businesses
to major corporations.

41:40.200 --> 41:43.870
- What are some of the largest clients?
- The largest here is AT&T.

41:45.371 --> 41:49.500
Their servers occupy more
than half of the floor space.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.460
- Can you show me?
- Yeah.

41:53.003 --> 41:54.129
Right this way.

42:09.727 --> 42:13.188
Did you or did you not
meet with Feng last night?

42:13.188 --> 42:15.899
<i>- Where is this coming from, Raymond?
- - Answer the question.</i>

42:15.899 --> 42:19.152
I have not contacted him since
you and I spoke, Mr. President.

42:19.152 --> 42:22.071
- Just as you instructed me to do.
- -<i> Not according to Feng.</i>

42:22.071 --> 42:24.657
I believe you were also instructed
to avoid him too, Raymond.

42:24.657 --> 42:26.826
<i>He reached out to me.</i>
<i>I just answered the call.</i>

42:26.826 --> 42:28.786
We had clear,
pre-arranged terms, Frank.

42:28.786 --> 42:30.329
Months of back-channeling.

42:30.329 --> 42:32.373
<i>I am on the frontlines,</i>
<i>Mr. President.</i>

42:32.373 --> 42:34.416
<i>And I can tell you firsthand</i>
<i>that we are dealing</i>

42:34.416 --> 42:36.835
with a regime that
is not being forthright

42:36.835 --> 42:40.171
and will seize upon the
faintest whiff of trepidation.

42:40.171 --> 42:43.800
This is a test to see how far
they can push us before we break.

42:43.800 --> 42:46.469
Do not play their game.
End the talks.

42:46.469 --> 42:48.471
<i>We can't overreact here.</i>

42:48.471 --> 42:50.472
Well, they walked away
from the Joint Commission.

42:50.472 --> 42:52.099
<i>We can walk away</i>
<i>from the summit.</i>

42:52.099 --> 42:54.476
The economic fallout
would be catastrophic.

42:54.476 --> 42:57.062
- The market will...
<i>- Or we can just kowtow and submit</i>

42:57.062 --> 42:59.898
- to the new reigning superpower.
- -<i> Don't be hyperbolic.</i>

42:59.898 --> 43:02.609
Well, we are dealing with
one quarter of the world's population.

43:02.609 --> 43:05.862
Mr. President, you would
be making a disastrous mistake.

43:05.862 --> 43:09.532
Where are your allegiances, Raymond?
To Xander Feng or to the United...

43:09.532 --> 43:12.701
<i>- Don't you dare question me...</i>
- All right. Silence.

43:12.701 --> 43:15.245
<i>There were two</i>
<i>mistakes. Both of them mine.</i>

43:15.245 --> 43:17.873
The first was allowing you,
Raymond,

43:17.873 --> 43:19.958
to enlist one of your business
partners for these talks.

43:19.958 --> 43:22.085
- I was trying to...
<i>- The second</i>

43:22.085 --> 43:24.212
<i>was enlisting you, Frank.</i>
<i>Instead of clarity,</i>

43:24.212 --> 43:26.047
<i>we got miscommunication.</i>
<i>That's poor diplomacy.</i>

43:26.047 --> 43:27.590
Mr. President, listen...

43:27.590 --> 43:29.216
I have listened to both of you.

43:29.216 --> 43:32.094
And all I've heard
is accusations.

43:32.094 --> 43:36.306
Now, if neither one of you will take
responsibility, I will. We're pulling out.

43:36.306 --> 43:40.060
<i>And it's not because you suggested it,
Frank, it's because you've made</i>

43:40.060 --> 43:44.856
<i>such a mess of these</i>
<i>negotiations I have no other</i>
<i>choice than a show of strength.</i>

43:44.856 --> 43:48.484
You both disappointed me...
greatly.

43:48.484 --> 43:53.197
- Mr. President?
<i>- The president has left the call.</i>

43:57.909 --> 44:02.038
<i>Raymond, are you still there?</i>

44:02.038 --> 44:05.208
That's the first time he's
ever hung up on me...

44:05.208 --> 44:10.129
<i>- ...in 20 years.</i>
- Oh, I feel for you.

44:10.129 --> 44:13.715
Goodbye, Frank.

44:15.884 --> 44:18.178
And the butchery begins.

44:18.178 --> 44:22.098
It's all the way down this row
and the next seven rows over.

44:22.098 --> 44:26.435
- You wanted to see inside one, right?
- Yeah. That would be great.

44:30.314 --> 44:32.107
Go ahead.

44:32.107 --> 44:34.610
There's not much to it,
actually.

44:34.610 --> 44:36.570
Just a lot of
hard drives and wires.

44:36.570 --> 44:39.906
So, in terms of backup,
if the power goes down,

44:39.906 --> 44:43.826
some natural disaster hits like a storm,
or an earthquake, what exactly...

44:43.826 --> 44:45.328
- On the ground.
- No, no...

44:45.328 --> 44:47.538
Right now.
I said on the fucking ground.

44:53.418 --> 44:57.464
Why don't you ride back to DC with me?
We need to discuss something.

44:57.464 --> 45:01.176
- What's up?
- We'll talk about it in the car.

45:01.176 --> 45:06.305
Today, we break earth on
the Overland Campaign Visitors Center,

45:06.305 --> 45:11.143
so that generations to come
will fully absorb the importance

45:11.143 --> 45:13.145
of this hallowed ground,

45:13.145 --> 45:17.190
the wilderness
where the campaign commenced.

45:22.403 --> 45:25.865
Augustus,
would you do the honor?

45:38.585 --> 45:43.923
And now, a moment of silence
and prayer for the dead.

46:08.821 --> 46:11.865
Thank you.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.495
And God bless
the United States of America.

46:20.665 --> 46:23.876
I just heard.
We got Lucas Goodwin.

46:33.844 --> 48:54.473
