WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.253
Previously on 90210:

00:03.295 --> 00:05.088
We have been dispatched
to spread winter cheer.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.423
And to tell you all...

00:06.465 --> 00:09.092
BOTH:
The Winter Wonderland Dance
is near.

00:09.134 --> 00:11.762
You don't want to go
to the dance, do you?
Whatever. Sure, I'll go.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.096
So what if I felt something

00:13.138 --> 00:14.473
when we kissed? That
doesn't change the fact...

00:14.515 --> 00:18.686
Silver, you just said you felt
something when you kissed.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.106
This is my sister Savannah
back from boarding school.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.149
For the life of me,

00:24.191 --> 00:25.651
I can't remember
why I ever let you go.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.114
Do you still have feelings
for Naomi?

00:31.156 --> 00:33.575
Yeah, I do.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.243
I got a text from Ivy
saying I had to come over here--

00:35.285 --> 00:36.453
that you had something
you wanted to tell me.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.122
I know this guy's
a drug dealer.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.582
What proof do you have?

00:40.624 --> 00:42.960
I've been buying from Jasper
for the last month.

00:43.002 --> 00:45.295
Look, Annie...
No, don't. Stay
away from me.

00:45.337 --> 00:47.088
Why? You've made mistakes,
but I don't judge you.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.507
What are you talking about?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.467
And you accidentally
ran over my uncle.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.355
(laughter)

01:03.397 --> 01:05.065
I'm gonna read
War and Peace.

01:05.105 --> 01:07.108
Oh, yeah, one of my
New Year's resolutions.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.402
I mean, why not?

01:08.443 --> 01:10.237
You know, it's like
it's really long, okay,

01:10.278 --> 01:12.031
but it's not in
Morse code or anything.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.156
I can read it.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.282
Uh-huh. Send.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.243
You're so not listening to me.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.619
Sure I am.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.704
I'm just texting Liam.

01:18.746 --> 01:23.000
Okay, for my New Year's
resolution...

01:23.042 --> 01:24.251
He's surfing.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.460
And he misses me.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.503
Oh.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.005
I have so much to tell him.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.683
(chuckles)
Aw, she just turned down
La Cienega.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.727
Somebody's text-whipped.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.853
She's cute.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.271
Oh, he is cute.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.397
We're cute.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.565
This is so exciting!

01:46.607 --> 01:48.025
So nauseating.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.777
"Irritating" is the word
that came to mind.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
Aw, don't be a hater.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.696
I'm not being a hater.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.364
I'm happy for you, actually.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.867
I'm happy if you're happy,
all right?

01:56.909 --> 02:00.203
So did Naomi say anything
about Silver in those texts?

02:00.245 --> 02:02.706
No. What's up
with you two, anyway?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.708
I can't believe you guys kissed.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.086
I know. It was out of the blue.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.711
It was amazing, man.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.548
Can't wait to talk to her
tomorrow at school.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.468
I just really hope
Dixon feels the same way.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.303
See you later, boy.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.805
All right, brother.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.186
Wow, look at all this.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.271
Well, I figured

02:26.313 --> 02:27.439
we had cause to celebrate.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.232
It's a new year.
Annie comes home tonight.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.525
Oh, and did I tell you

02:30.567 --> 02:32.235
that she called to say
she missed us?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.237
Seriously?
Seriously.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.573
And last night on the phone,
she was even laughing.

02:36.615 --> 02:39.743
And it wasn't that snarky,
derisive laugh.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.202
It was the good kind.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.871
It's a miracle
I still recognize it.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.331
Who knew Vegas
was the answer?

02:44.372 --> 02:45.582
Two weeks on the Strip

02:45.624 --> 02:47.167
would have driven
me crazy,

02:47.208 --> 02:49.294
and that's even if my mother
wasn't living there.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.630
Harry, is this that same
boosters reception

02:51.672 --> 02:53.924
we went to last year?

02:53.966 --> 02:56.635
Yeah, yeah, I think it is.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.429
Well, did you not tell me
about this earlier

02:59.471 --> 03:01.098
because you knew
Kelly would be there?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.933
No.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.101
Look, I-I...

03:04.143 --> 03:06.520
I didn't want you
to be uncomfortable.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.313
Should I be uncomfortable?

03:08.355 --> 03:09.815
No, sweetheart,
of course not.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.984
You know, I mean, I've barely
exchanged ten words with Kelly

03:12.026 --> 03:13.819
since we realized
she had a crush on me.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.570
Since you realized
she had a crush on me.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.780
But trust me,

03:16.822 --> 03:19.282
I've done everything I can
to avoid her.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.451
Well, I am not interested
in avoiding anybody.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.788
And I'm certainly not going
to let Kelly determine what
school functions I attend.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.123
I'm going to this, Harry.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.541
Just like I did
last year.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.209
Great.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.180
And if I think about it,
I can't even remember

03:41.221 --> 03:43.473
why me and Silver broke up
in the first place.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.600
Well, wasn't it because
she liked horror movies

03:45.642 --> 03:47.895
and you're afraid
of the dark?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.898
Okay, very funny.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.149
All right.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.735
Look, me and her,
we both did our thing.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.320
She's changed.
I've changed.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.322
Now maybe we can
get back together.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.992
I'm gonna talk to her
tomorrow at school.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.328
Definitely before
U.S. History though.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.123
'Cause then she just gets
hopped up on conspiracy theories

04:08.165 --> 04:09.624
and then there's
no talking to her.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.171
Hey.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.005
You okay?

04:16.048 --> 04:19.843
Yeah. I just... I'm really
not looking forward

04:19.885 --> 04:23.180
to going back to school
tomorrow, that's all.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.182
Look, it's not going
to be as bad as you think.

04:25.224 --> 04:26.683
I mean, you already
did the hard part

04:26.725 --> 04:28.351
and broke up with Jasper, so...

04:28.393 --> 04:30.854
It's already better
than it was.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.785
I'll be right down.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.849
Okay, are you sure I look
tan enough in this shirt?

05:07.891 --> 05:10.102
Because at home, I swore
this was a blue-white,

05:10.144 --> 05:12.146
but now it's looking more
like a yellow-white.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.564
Yes, Naomi, you look
incredibly tan.

05:14.606 --> 05:18.026
In fact, you look tanner
than you did yesterday.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.653
How is that
even possible?

05:19.694 --> 05:22.239
Well, I may have gone
to the tanning salon last night.

05:22.281 --> 05:24.199
What?! Okay, I really want
a "wow" effect

05:24.241 --> 05:26.576
when I walk into Allison's
sister's 21st birthday party.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.203
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.247
Everybody's going to be like,
"Wow, you've got leather skin."

05:30.289 --> 05:31.748
Oh, that's like
20 years away.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.833
The party is tomorrow night.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.585
It's going to be
a total blowout.

05:35.627 --> 05:36.795
She rented out
the beach club.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.838
I cannot...

05:37.879 --> 05:38.922
Hey, guys.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.132
Hi.
Hey.

05:40.174 --> 05:42.634
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.136
Oh, no, you didn't.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.428
How-how was your break?

05:45.470 --> 05:46.972
It was good.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.431
You know, just laid low.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.184
How about yours?
How was St. Barts?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.643
Oh...

05:51.685 --> 05:52.853
Wow, you look really tan.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.605
Yeah, yeah, it was great.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.940
Tan-tastic.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.108
That's great.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.776
Um, I should
probably get going.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.778
I'll see you guys later?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.113
Fine.
Okay.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.365
Yep, yep, what did
I tell you?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.160
Yeah, so, I didn't know
if it was going to cold,

06:08.202 --> 06:09.328
but it wasn't bad.
It wasn't.

06:09.368 --> 06:11.454
And I got the 3.2,
so it was all right.

06:11.496 --> 06:12.706
Yo.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.249
Hey, what's up, dudes?
What's up, kid?

06:14.291 --> 06:15.542
So Northern California
was cool, huh?

06:15.583 --> 06:18.212
Oh, dude, it was awesome.
I really like Berkeley.

06:18.253 --> 06:19.462
Cool place, man.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.382
I even brought this, uh,
this really cool souvenir.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.805
Navid, is that...?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.849
Navid, what the hell are
you doing with cocaine?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.123
Okay, um...
I think you need
to put that away.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.043
What the hell is
wrong with you?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.920
Will you just relax?
DIXON:
We will not relax.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.382
What are you doing with...
cocaine?

07:03.422 --> 07:06.051
You don't do drugs. At least
I hope you don't do drugs.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.220
Of course I don't
do drugs, man.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.972
I was going to plant this
in Jasper's locker.
Oh, come on.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.391
And then I was going to call

07:12.432 --> 07:13.808
that anonymous tip number
over there.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.727
They'll find the stuff.
It'll be all buh-bye.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.437
Just like
the poster says.

07:17.478 --> 07:19.273
I'm not a rat.

07:19.314 --> 07:21.233
I'm a hero.
LIAM:
Yeah, well, you're not a hero.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.650
You're an idiot.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.236
DIXON:
Seriously, Navid,
this is a really bad idea.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.570
It's even worse than

07:25.612 --> 07:27.406
your Boys of the Blaze
fund-raising calendar.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.574
Okay, look, Jasper is
already a drug dealer, okay?

07:29.616 --> 07:32.244
I'm just bringing that to the
attention of the powers-that-be.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.578
It's simple.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.871
All right, fine.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.749
How do you plan
on getting in his locker?

07:37.791 --> 07:41.336
Okay, well, there's this,
you know, master list

07:41.378 --> 07:45.632
of all the student locker
combinations

07:45.673 --> 07:48.385
on file in the
principal's office.

07:49.552 --> 07:52.055
Me?
Yes.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.932
No, no. Sorry.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.434
Hmm-mm.
Dixon...

07:55.475 --> 07:57.811
I understand. You want...
you want to think about it.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.646
No way, all right? I'm
not helping you with this.

07:59.687 --> 08:00.730
It's stupid.
Dixon...

08:00.772 --> 08:01.731
You're on your own, kid.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.275
It's your funeral.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.860
Dude, it's not that big
of a deal.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.367
(sighs)

08:12.409 --> 08:15.120
Did you get
my flowers?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.622
Yeah, look...

08:17.664 --> 08:19.207
Look, I really missed you.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.293
Jasper, stop.
We're not dating.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.044
What are you talking about?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.296
I'm breaking up with you.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.297
You don't mean that.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.423
Yeah, I do.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.049
Annie...
It's over.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.343
Then I'll tell.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.721
What?

08:33.763 --> 08:36.724
I'll go to the police
and I'll tell them what you did.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.894
All they need is
a lead in the case.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.562
You know, they'll probably
start combing

08:41.604 --> 08:43.440
through
your Internet history.

08:43.482 --> 08:47.486
See if you have any...
special interest in the case.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.072
Annie, I'm guessing that

08:51.114 --> 08:53.116
it's not going to be that
hard to find evidence.

08:53.158 --> 08:55.785
I mean, you probably
took the car

08:55.827 --> 08:58.163
to a local body shop
that night, right?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.457
After you ran over my uncle.

09:00.499 --> 09:04.585
Why... why are you doing this?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.797
I love you.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.799
You love me. I know you do.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.803
Look, we've both
made mistakes,

09:13.845 --> 09:15.722
but I want to put
them behind us.

09:17.682 --> 09:21.061
Just say you can do that,
and I'll keep your secret.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.105
Okay?

09:25.273 --> 09:29.319
(sniffling)

09:29.361 --> 09:31.112
Come here.

09:47.212 --> 09:51.466
Hey. Well, if it isn't the
fancy Caribbean jet-setter.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.510
Oh, yes, that is me.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.095
(laughing)

09:55.136 --> 09:57.347
So, look, I want to talk about
what happened at the dance.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.933
Yeah, um, yeah, me, too.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.143
Look, it was obviously
a mistake.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.021
Yeah, exactly.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.065
That-that's exactly what
I was going to say.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.025
Yeah. We broke up
for a reason.

10:09.067 --> 10:10.235
I mean, like you said,

10:10.277 --> 10:11.861
you could never really be
yourself around me.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.697
That-that's what I said.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.200
I think I was just
feeling vulnerable.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.577
I mean,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.287
I was feeling rejected
by Teddy,

10:20.328 --> 10:22.581
and when I saw him
with that other girl, but...

10:22.622 --> 10:26.876
the truth is... maybe
I just jump to conclusions.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.378
You know, maybe that girl
was just his friend.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.380
Anyway, I'm going to talk to him

10:30.422 --> 10:32.382
and see if we can
figure things out.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.552
Yeah, yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.054
So I'm going to let you
get back to work.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.306
And I'll talk
to you later?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.307
Yeah.

10:40.348 --> 10:41.766
Cool.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.604
(sighs)

10:48.689 --> 10:50.066
Hey, Ives.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.485
What you reading?

10:51.526 --> 10:55.780
Uh... The Violent Messiahs.

10:56.864 --> 10:57.991
Right.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.576
It's actually really rad.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.910
It's Lieutenant Major Cheri,

11:00.952 --> 11:02.412
who's apparently, like,
a schizophrenic now,

11:02.454 --> 11:04.122
and she's chasing down this
gnarly masked villain...

11:04.164 --> 11:05.248
Whoa.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.376
Spoiler alert.
(laughing)

11:08.418 --> 11:11.045
Um, so listen.
I wanted to thank you

11:11.087 --> 11:12.755
for sending me that text the
other night after the dance.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.757
Oh, please. That was...
That was nothing.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.593
It wasn't nothing.
You guys were, like, together.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.677
What, me and Liam?
No. Please.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.763
That was... that was
nothing serious.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.474
And I knew
he liked you, so...

11:22.516 --> 11:24.934
Well, it meant
something to me.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.769
And in appreciation,

11:26.811 --> 11:31.149
a little thank you gift
from St. Bart's.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.360
Yeah, you really didn't
have to do that. That's...

11:33.401 --> 11:34.611
Go ahead. Open it.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.616
It was not easy shopping
there, by the way.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.075
Everyone kept yammering
away in French,

11:41.117 --> 11:42.952
but I found that if you spoke
loudly and slowly enough,

11:42.994 --> 11:44.454
you could eventually
get through to them

11:44.496 --> 11:46.665
that you did not want
their island junk.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.583
I hit the jackpot
at Duty Free.

11:51.169 --> 11:56.049
Wow. Wow. Um...

11:57.384 --> 11:58.677
Isn't this something?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.178
(laughs):
I hope you don't have one
already.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.348
Yeah, no. Definitely not.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.643
But, you know, I've always
wanted a, um, pocketbook.

12:06.685 --> 12:07.935
Oh, it's a Fendi baguette.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.313
But no worries.
Fendi baguette.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.232
But it's the least I could do.
Anyway. Thanks again, Ives.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.994
All right, I'm not saying,
"kick him in the groin,"

12:25.036 --> 12:26.705
but near the groin...
(groans)

12:26.745 --> 12:27.997
...would be great.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.207
(sniffs)

12:31.959 --> 12:33.378
Um...

12:34.212 --> 12:35.880
So, how was vacation?

12:40.051 --> 12:41.177
(laughing)

12:41.219 --> 12:43.471
Oh, a blast.
Time of my life.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.223
Aspen, right?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.353
So, we're really gonna pretend
everything's fine here?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.521
I saw you kiss Silver
at the dance.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.731
At least man up.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.940
That was a
lame-ass move, bro.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.525
You know I liked her.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.776
Oh, come on, man. It can't
be that big of a deal.

12:57.818 --> 13:00.655
I bet you got over it
pretty quickly in Aspen, right?

13:00.697 --> 13:03.491
(grunts)
(groans)

13:03.533 --> 13:06.035
No, I didn't just get over it
'cause I like Silver.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.786
I thought I'd made that
fairly clear to everyone

13:07.828 --> 13:08.996
by the night of the dance.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.915
(chuckles)

13:13.376 --> 13:15.378
(groans)

13:15.420 --> 13:17.380
If there's something
going on between you two,

13:17.422 --> 13:18.632
I think I deserve to know.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.218
Ooh.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.970
Okay, I'll-I'll
be straight with you.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.433
I don't think me and Silver
are over yet.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.059
You know, what happened
the night of the dance?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.394
It just happened.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.563
Will it happen again?
Probably.

13:33.605 --> 13:36.357
Look, we're trying
to keep it on the DL,

13:36.399 --> 13:37.692
but, you know,
between me and you,

13:37.734 --> 13:39.986
we're talking about
getting back together again.

13:40.027 --> 13:41.362
Come on, man.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.554
Hey, Annie.
Hey.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.056
How was...
How was your break?

14:09.098 --> 14:11.058
It was good.
How was yours?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.310
Ah. Too short.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.313
You know?
Yeah. I hear you.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.148
So, listen, um...

14:17.190 --> 14:19.859
We haven't really talked,
you know, since the dance.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.945
Wondering what's going on
with you and Jasper.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.115
Annie, please tell us
you broke up with him.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.662
It's complicated.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.789
What's complicated about it?
He's a drug dealer.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.415
SILVER:
And he lied to you, Annie.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.875
He's a really bad guy.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.669
And he's pretty
greasy-looking, honestly.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.504
Stop. Okay?

14:39.546 --> 14:40.755
Please just stop.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.674
You don't...
You don't get to do this.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.884
Annie...
Leave me alone,
all right?

14:44.925 --> 14:46.553
It shouldn't be hard.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.262
You've done it before.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.525
Teddy!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.151
Hey, you.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.319
Silver. What's up?

15:03.361 --> 15:06.280
Not much. Um, I
want to talk to you

15:06.322 --> 15:07.365
about what happened
at the dance.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.366
Because, uh...

15:08.408 --> 15:10.201
I thought about it
a lot and I...

15:10.243 --> 15:11.703
Yeah, about that.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.705
You know, you were right
about me all along.

15:13.747 --> 15:17.041
"Once a player, always a
player." Your words, right?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.918
I can't be tied down
to one person.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.920
It's just...
It's not in my DNA.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.255
Why are you telling me this?

15:22.296 --> 15:24.674
Because you saw it before I did.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.760
I mean, I can't even
decide who to take

15:26.801 --> 15:28.302
to this Beach Club
party on Saturday.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.888
I mean, Emiko's hot, but,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.556
God, Alisa's...

15:31.598 --> 15:33.099
She's easy.
(chuckles)

15:33.140 --> 15:35.226
Dilemma, right?

15:35.268 --> 15:38.646
Yeah. I'm sure you're going
to figure it out, though.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.829
Hey, Jasper!
How's it going, man?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.421
Dixon! Wait!
I need to talk to you.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.756
What's up?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.006
It's about Annie.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.592
She's still dating Jasper.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.969
What?!
Yeah.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.679
I saw them in the hallway
holding hands.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.180
I went to talk
to her about it,

16:13.222 --> 16:14.766
but she said it's not
my right to interfere.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.560
And she's right. It isn't.

16:17.602 --> 16:19.562
But maybe you can
do something about it.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.814
You're her brother.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.149
Maybe she'll listen to you.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.567
Okay.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.503
Hey, you.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.838
Oh.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.130
Hi, Gia.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.967
Um, I didn't know
you were in AA.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.551
Yeah, that's sort of what
the "Anonymous" is about.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.847
It was a joke.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.723
(laughs)
Right.
I was kidding.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.141
Right.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.310
A couple of us always go bowling

16:59.352 --> 17:00.854
after the meetings.
You want to come?

17:00.895 --> 17:02.897
Um, I don't think so.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.275
You sure? Last week we had
a down-to-the-last-frame match

17:06.317 --> 17:08.319
with some dentists from
Culver City. Very exciting.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.988
(laughs)
That sounds tempting.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.823
But the thing is,

17:11.865 --> 17:13.825
AA is a part of me,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.326
but I don't want it
to be my whole life.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.953
You know?
Yeah.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.498
I-I just like having friends
around who kind of understand

17:20.540 --> 17:22.000
what I'm going through.
I mean, I figured...

17:22.040 --> 17:25.878
My friends do.
Or... they did.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.547
Things are kind of weird
with us right now,

17:27.588 --> 17:29.423
but I'm working on it.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.551
Thanks anyway.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.053
Well, if you change your mind
or if you ever want to talk,

17:34.094 --> 17:35.221
or anything,
give me a call.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.893
I'll see you around.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.787
Thank you.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.876
(clears throat)

18:04.918 --> 18:07.127
Thanks.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.129
Wow. This is great.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.884
Well, I've been planning
this night for a long time.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.719
I wanted it to be perfect.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.888
Well, good job.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.389
Thanks.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.391
You're welcome.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.143
Thanks. (chuckles)

18:23.185 --> 18:26.064
(speaking simultaneously)

18:26.105 --> 18:28.066
What was that?
Sorry. Uh...

18:28.107 --> 18:30.568
Nothing. I... Yeah.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.570
(sighs)

18:32.612 --> 18:34.072
Well, here we are.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.239
At last.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.699
I know, right?
Finally.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.661
So, how was vacation?
So, how was St. Bart's?

18:40.703 --> 18:41.829
Sorry.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.081
No. Go ahead.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.792
Now, I was just... I was
asking you about St. Bart's.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.668
Did you have fun?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.920
Yeah, it was gorgeous.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.254
Did you go snorkeling?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.756
Um, no.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.007
Well, how about
parasailing?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.842
I hear they have amazing
parasailing there.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.511
No, I really just
kind of laid by the pool

18:57.553 --> 18:58.679
the whole time.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.515
Oh. Well, sounds fun.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.517
Yeah. It was great.
What about you? What did you do?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.061
Well, I worked on the boat.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.564
Um, the hull's been planked
and ribbed, so I've just got

19:08.606 --> 19:10.942
to finish the framing, sheathe
the deck panels, you know...

19:10.984 --> 19:13.277
And this is boring.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.488
No, it's not boring.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.490
Deck panels are rad.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.493
(chuckles)

19:22.912 --> 19:25.623
So, um, what's
new with you?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.459
Um, I'm redecorating
the house.
Oh, yeah?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.670
Yeah, I'm working
with this feng shui expert.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.213
At first I thought
it was another Chinese scam

19:33.255 --> 19:36.009
like tai chi or acupuncture.
(chuckles)

19:36.050 --> 19:38.011
But I really think
she's on to something.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.762
She's helping me remove
all signs of Jen, so...

19:39.804 --> 19:41.055
That's good.
Oh.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.975
Yeah, well,
that makes sense.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.686
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have mentioned Jen.

19:46.727 --> 19:49.355
No, it's okay.
No, it's not.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.397
Um...

19:50.439 --> 19:52.316
I just want to really
forget about her

19:52.358 --> 19:53.860
and everything she did.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.487
Look, I'm-I'm really sorry
again.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.990
I just...
Can we not talk
about it? Please.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.201
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Sorry.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.497
(sighs)
Have you seen the waiter?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.173
You will love this.
(laughs)

20:15.214 --> 20:20.178
Okay. So, see? Now you shake,
and it's gone.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.929
So Dad can't bust me

20:21.971 --> 20:23.973
for reading about Jude Law's
latest love child

20:24.015 --> 20:25.099
instead of writing
my Hamlet paper.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.187
Though, technically,
because Jude Law

20:29.228 --> 20:30.521
is playing Hamlet
on Broadway,

20:30.563 --> 20:33.399
can't you just argue
that it's research?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.109
Not bad.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.402
(both laugh)

20:41.074 --> 20:43.201
Hey, um...

20:43.242 --> 20:45.036
So, I heard
through the grapevine

20:45.078 --> 20:48.081
that you're, um,
back with Jasper.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.249
Dixon, stay out of it.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.751
Annie, look.
I just don't get it.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.419
Yeah, well, you don't have to.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.213
Look, that guy is bad news.
You got to see that.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.422
Yeah, look, stop.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.924
Okay, seriously,

20:57.965 --> 21:00.426
I don't want to talk
to you about Jasper.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.762
And we've been
getting along lately.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.388
Let's not mess it up.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.806
Okay?

21:05.848 --> 21:07.725
Okay.

21:07.767 --> 21:08.809
I'm sorry.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.686
(chuckles)

21:10.728 --> 21:12.521
I actually kind of like
that we've been getting along.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.900
I'll talk to you later.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.818
Good night.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.320
(sighs)

21:27.078 --> 21:28.746
NAVID:
Hello? Dixon?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.831
Hey, Navid.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.374
Yeah, yeah. It's Dixon.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.751
Um...

21:33.793 --> 21:36.963
About the Jasper plan?
I'm in.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.843
IVY:
Liam! What's up?

21:42.885 --> 21:44.011
Hey.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.679
So, how are things?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.347
Good, good.

21:47.389 --> 21:52.103
Go on. How was the big date
with the big "N"?

21:52.145 --> 21:53.520
(chuckles)

21:53.562 --> 21:54.688
What?

21:54.730 --> 21:55.940
Nothing, just...

21:55.982 --> 21:57.233
Isn't it
kind of weird?

21:57.275 --> 21:59.110
Can we talk
about that?

21:59.152 --> 22:02.071
Uh, no, not for me.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.576
Liam, get over yourself
'cause I did.

22:07.618 --> 22:08.995
Seriously, what,
you think

22:09.036 --> 22:11.080
I'm in love with you
or something?

22:11.122 --> 22:12.206
Get real!

22:12.248 --> 22:15.001
Whatever. I'll just ask
Naomi myself.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.877
You know she gave me
a pocketbook?

22:16.919 --> 22:17.920
Seriously?

22:17.962 --> 22:21.423
Well, yeah.
We're, like, buds.

22:23.176 --> 22:25.094
Okay, look,
between you and me,

22:25.136 --> 22:28.014
the date didn't go
so well.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.307
You serious?

22:29.347 --> 22:33.102
Yeah, it was awkward
and just... weird.

22:33.144 --> 22:34.520
Wow, I'm sorry, man.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.230
Yeah, it sucked.

22:36.272 --> 22:38.983
Okay, but you know

22:39.025 --> 22:40.234
you win some,
you lose some.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.694
It was worth a shot,
I guess.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.071
Right?
Yeah.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.364
It was worth a shot.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.914
I got it.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.249
Hey, Mrs. List,

22:55.291 --> 22:58.502
do you mind if I go leave
a note on my dad's desk?

22:58.544 --> 22:59.461
Go right ahead.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.587
Cool.
I'll wait

23:00.629 --> 23:02.840
right here
for you, bro.
Cool.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.177
NAVID:
Uh, nice blouse,
Mrs. L.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.512
Okay, files... files.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.097
The paisley's really

23:10.139 --> 23:11.307
working for you.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.641
All right.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.688
Hey, have you seen Silver?

23:17.730 --> 23:19.148
Um, no.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.942
Oh, shoot.
I really need to talk to her.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.236
Is everything okay?

23:23.277 --> 23:24.362
No, it's not.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.821
What's going on?

23:27.656 --> 23:30.576
Come on. You can tell me.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.954
(sighs)

23:33.996 --> 23:36.790
I had my first date with Liam
last night

23:36.832 --> 23:37.875
and it was terrible.

23:37.917 --> 23:38.876
Oh, no.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.127
Oh, yeah.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.129
We had absolutely nothing
to say to each other.

23:42.171 --> 23:43.172
I don't get it.

23:43.214 --> 23:44.631
How could things

23:44.673 --> 23:46.550
between such good-looking people
be so boring?!

23:46.592 --> 23:48.177
You're probably nervous.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.720
And he was probably nervous.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.389
You both just wanted it
to be perfect,

23:51.429 --> 23:53.557
you know?
It wasn't perfect.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.433
It wasn't even passable.

23:55.475 --> 23:57.435
I think we lost our spark.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.854
Maybe we have
no chemistry anymore.

23:58.896 --> 23:59.980
Don't give up.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.315
This is Liam
we're talking about.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.400
You've waited so long.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.818
Maybe we waited too long.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.486
Maybe we missed our moment.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.822
I don't believe that.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.367
I think there was just a lot
of build-up. That's all.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.202
And if chemistry
is what you're worried about,

24:13.244 --> 24:14.661
I think there's
a pretty clear way

24:14.703 --> 24:15.746
to test that out.

24:18.374 --> 24:20.000
Oh. Well.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.377
You could be right.
(chuckles)

24:22.460 --> 24:23.837
Thanks, Ade.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.547
Of course. Anytime.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.926
Hey, Silver and I are going
to Allison's sister's

24:28.968 --> 24:30.303
21st birthday party.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.845
I think

24:31.887 --> 24:32.846
you should come with us.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.891
I'd love to.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.768
Good.

24:49.447 --> 24:50.823
Oh...

24:52.741 --> 24:54.285
(printer whirring)

24:54.327 --> 24:55.369
(chuckles)

24:55.411 --> 24:56.954
Come to Papa.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.582
NAVID:
Whoa, whoa,
look who's here.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.751
Uh, Principal Wilson
in the house.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.044
Hey, yo.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.881
Looks like you lost
some weight. Am I right?

25:07.923 --> 25:10.050
Yeah, could be.
Might have dropped
a couple of pounds.

25:10.092 --> 25:14.096
Well, wow, you look fantastic,
just, uh... fantastic.

25:14.138 --> 25:15.931
Well, yeah, thank you.

25:18.476 --> 25:19.559
Thank you.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.103
(Harry humming)

25:21.145 --> 25:22.480
Hey, Dad!

25:22.520 --> 25:25.274
Um, I was just
about to leave you a note

25:25.316 --> 25:26.900
tell you I was going to Navid's

25:26.942 --> 25:27.901
house, but you know,

25:27.943 --> 25:28.819
you're here.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.488
Guess I don't have to.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.738
Uh, see you later.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.199
Okay.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.492
And we'll see
you later.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.331
Get it?
Yeah.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.290
Bye.
Bye.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.879
Annie, hey.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.285
Hey. All right,

26:18.327 --> 26:21.455
you ready to do some sucking up
to the superintendent?

26:21.497 --> 26:22.956
I'd be delighted.
Okay.

26:24.333 --> 26:27.794
Ooh!
Ooh!

26:27.836 --> 26:28.795
Hey.
Hi.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.796
Hello, Kelly.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.132
Quite a turnout.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.675
Yes, this is quite a turnout.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.302
Definitely.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.013
Um, you know what?

26:38.055 --> 26:40.640
I was just on my way to talk
to some boosters.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.143
So I'll see you guys later.

26:43.185 --> 26:47.106
See? That wasn't
so bad, was it?

26:47.147 --> 26:48.482
No, it wasn't.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.776
But I'm gonna go talk to her.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.319
What?

27:00.369 --> 27:02.329
MAN:
Can I take
your coats, please?

27:02.371 --> 27:04.164
NAOMI:
Uh, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.623
ADRIANNA:
Aren't you gonna be warm?

27:05.665 --> 27:07.834
Uh! I'd feel naked
without it.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.836
Why?
Because I'm naked
without it.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.922
Nao... What?!
Really?

27:13.090 --> 27:14.174
Okay,

27:14.216 --> 27:15.633
Ade and I came up
with this

27:15.675 --> 27:18.220
master plan to test
mine and Liam's chemistry.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.055
Didn't we, Ade?
This was your idea?

27:20.097 --> 27:23.142
Not exactly.
I mean, did you even ask Liam

27:23.183 --> 27:24.184
if he was coming tonight?

27:24.226 --> 27:25.185
Why wouldn't he be?

27:25.227 --> 27:28.481
Um, because he's not
exactly Mr. Social.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.648
Okay, something tells me
Ade's plan was not completely

27:30.690 --> 27:31.858
thought through.
Ade's plan?!

27:31.900 --> 27:33.569
I did not tell her to come
to the Beach Club naked!

27:33.611 --> 27:35.613
Yes. You practically did.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.948
Shut up!
Drinks!

27:39.074 --> 27:40.367
To enforced dress codes.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.952
(laughs sarcastically)

27:43.078 --> 27:45.038
Oh, my God, there's rum in here.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.206
Yes, there is.

27:46.248 --> 27:48.875
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

27:48.917 --> 27:50.085
Are you okay?

27:50.127 --> 27:51.545
Yeah. Totally.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.088
I'm fine.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.090
I mean, it happens.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.133
So, no Liam?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.135
No, I haven't seen him.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.761
Shoot. I'm getting warm.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.805
Keep the jacket on.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.723
Uh, I'm going to run
to the ladies' room.

28:03.765 --> 28:04.891
I will be right back.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.810
We'll be over here.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.063
(both laugh)

28:10.105 --> 28:11.982
(sighs)

28:14.109 --> 28:15.986
(sniffling)

28:17.154 --> 28:18.947
GIA:
Hello.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.950
Oh... hey.
Hey. It's Adrianna.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.952
Look, something just happened,

28:23.994 --> 28:25.329
and, um...

28:25.371 --> 28:28.332
I was wondering maybe
you'd want to meet up

28:28.374 --> 28:31.335
because I could really use
someone to talk to.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.419
Sure.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.421
I'm at a party
at the Beach Club.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.423
Well, you're in luck.

28:36.465 --> 28:38.342
Nice sweater.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.974
Everything okay?

28:46.016 --> 28:47.518
I don't know.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.935
I accidentally drank
some rum and Coke.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.021
Just a sip,
but the taste...

28:51.063 --> 28:51.980
I'm freaking out.

28:52.022 --> 28:53.982
Of course you are.
It triggered something.

28:54.024 --> 28:56.776
I mean, you start second-
guessing yourself, you know?

28:56.818 --> 28:58.070
Did I know

28:58.111 --> 28:59.279
there was alcohol in the drink?

28:59.321 --> 29:01.198
Did I want to screw up?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.782
I took a sip and I'm still here.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.159
It's not the end of the world.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.785
Okay, stop torturing yourself.

29:05.827 --> 29:07.787
No, I should have been
more responsible.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.789
This is my fault.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.625
I'm at a party
where people are drinking.

29:11.667 --> 29:14.628
Look, this whole sober living
thing-- it's a process.

29:14.670 --> 29:16.296
It's going to take
some time, okay?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.966
(sighs)

29:20.008 --> 29:21.635
(chatting indistinctly)

29:21.677 --> 29:23.303
Thank you.
Excuse me.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.722
I'm so sorry
to interrupt.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.390
Can I borrow you
for a second?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.225
I would love
to talk to you alone.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.809
(chuckles)

29:29.851 --> 29:31.270
Excuse me.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.065
Let's talk about

29:35.107 --> 29:37.776
that little crush
you have on my husband.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.405
Okay, look, there is
no reason for you

29:41.447 --> 29:42.573
to feel threatened.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.241
(sighs)
No.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.534
I'm not threatened.

29:45.576 --> 29:46.535
I'm annoyed.

29:46.577 --> 29:47.745
I'm sorry that you're annoyed.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.162
That was not my intention.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.205
Well, enlighten me.

29:50.247 --> 29:51.624
What was your intention?

29:51.665 --> 29:53.375
What, to-to break up
my marriage?

29:53.417 --> 29:54.668
No, absolutely not.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.211
I...

29:56.253 --> 29:58.213
I've been through a lot
with my mom lately,

29:58.255 --> 29:59.548
and Harry ended up

29:59.590 --> 30:01.550
being someone that
I could talk to.

30:01.592 --> 30:03.343
Someone that I
could lean on.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.345
And you're right.
I shouldn't have.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.847
But you have to know
that the minute I felt

30:07.889 --> 30:10.350
that there was anything
like a crush--

30:10.392 --> 30:11.477
I hate using that word...

30:13.145 --> 30:15.481
...I steered clear of him.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.857
I did not want
to cross that line.

30:17.899 --> 30:20.736
You have to
believe me.

30:20.778 --> 30:23.155
I'm not that person anymore.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.328
You see that buoy
down there?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.124
Damn.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.542
That was close.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.711
Not really.
Okay.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.045
You try.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.756
I don't want to throw rocks.

30:40.798 --> 30:43.091
Okay.

30:43.133 --> 30:45.093
You want to go see a movie?

30:45.135 --> 30:47.262
They're playing this Bollywood
movie Three Idiots.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.598
No. I hate movies
with subtitles.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.974
Since when?

30:51.016 --> 30:52.518
Since forever.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.561
I like to watch movies,
not read them.

30:54.603 --> 30:56.563
Oh, you should have told me.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.607
I mean, we've seem so many
foreign films.

30:58.649 --> 31:00.776
Whatever. Now you know.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.402
Oh, and just so
you also know,

31:02.444 --> 31:04.404
uh, most of the movies
that we have seen,

31:04.446 --> 31:05.947
I actually kinda hated.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.783
What?
Yeah.

31:07.825 --> 31:11.119
I, uh, I could barely keep
my eyes open for the most part.

31:11.161 --> 31:13.121
I guess I was trying
to impress you,

31:13.163 --> 31:14.498
but I just found them

31:14.540 --> 31:15.791
incredibly boring.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.334
I mean, the plots
were all convoluted

31:17.376 --> 31:18.794
and pretentious and...
Just stop it.

31:18.836 --> 31:22.088
Just-just stop!

31:22.130 --> 31:23.799
I know

31:23.841 --> 31:25.801
what you're trying to do.
You're trying to pick a fight.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.135
But it's not going to work.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.971
Okay?

31:30.013 --> 31:32.974
I'm not going to fall for it.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.811
I just...

31:35.853 --> 31:37.813
Annie...

31:37.855 --> 31:41.316
I love you no matter
what movies you like.

31:41.358 --> 31:42.484
Okay?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.986
Because we're not
like other couples.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.447
I mean, we're soul mates.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.157
And you know
what that means?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.161
Well, it means
that soul mates...

31:54.872 --> 31:57.875
...they're forever.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.793
Forever.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.196
Wait, aren't you

32:28.238 --> 32:30.824
forgetting something?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.166
See you at school.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.435
You know what
we need to do?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.229
We need to find you
a nice, available guy.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.564
Yeah.

33:02.606 --> 33:05.651
Preferably
not an actor.
Hmm.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.402
Or a teacher.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.237
And ideally...

33:09.279 --> 33:10.781
Straight.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.199
Yeah, that's not
gonna be easy.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.956
(giggling)

33:18.997 --> 33:20.290
There's this great yoga class
you should try.

33:20.332 --> 33:21.625
In fact, I might
go tomorrow morning

33:21.667 --> 33:23.710
if you want to
come with me.
Sure, I'd love to.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.629
Good, because I think
I have someone

33:25.671 --> 33:27.965
you just might be
interested in.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.508
KELLY:
Hmm, you work fast.

33:31.301 --> 33:35.013
Okay, three letters-- WTF--
spring to mind.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.097
What?

33:36.139 --> 33:37.808
What the frick just happened?

33:37.850 --> 33:41.311
Oh, it turns out her crush
wasn't about you at all.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.648
(chuckles)

33:44.690 --> 33:47.526
Well... it had to be
a little bit about me.

33:47.567 --> 33:48.944
Nope.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.529
Could've been anyone.

33:50.570 --> 33:51.822
Could've been you, Coach Cooper.

33:51.864 --> 33:54.449
Lou, the gardener.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.159
Lou has the mind of a child.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.578
(giggling)

34:03.876 --> 34:05.084
It's not even the worst part.

34:05.126 --> 34:07.337
Naomi, okay, she unbuttons
another button

34:07.379 --> 34:09.255
because now she's sweating.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.422
Oh, no.
Yeah!

34:10.465 --> 34:11.800
I know!

34:11.842 --> 34:14.719
I'm, like, please do not
let the AC go off tonight.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.179
This girl, I swear,

34:16.221 --> 34:18.431
she is...

34:21.184 --> 34:22.268
Silver, you okay?

34:23.436 --> 34:25.355
Ugh...

34:25.397 --> 34:29.359
Whoa, um, look,

34:29.400 --> 34:31.610
it's gonna be okay,
all right?

34:39.578 --> 34:40.996
Hey.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.121
I didn't see you
at the Beach Club.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.666
So, I figured I'd come here.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.210
Oh, cool.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.880
Is it, uh, is it hot in here?

34:50.922 --> 34:53.216
Uh, yeah, maybe a little.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.885
Let me see if the heat's on.

34:54.927 --> 34:57.763
I can easily turn it off.

35:13.946 --> 35:15.822
(sighing)

35:15.864 --> 35:18.450
That was, wow.
Whoo.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.619
I know, right?

35:20.660 --> 35:24.039
So, um...
Anyway...

35:24.081 --> 35:25.457
Hmm?
No, what were you saying?

35:25.498 --> 35:27.125
No, nothing.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.627
You?

35:28.668 --> 35:31.964
Nothing, um...

35:42.975 --> 35:45.811
And if you like country music,
they have sober line dancing.

35:45.852 --> 35:47.145
Plus, sober roller-skating

35:47.186 --> 35:48.438
and sober bar hopping.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.773
Really?

35:49.815 --> 35:52.150
I'm just kidding.

35:52.191 --> 35:54.694
Yeah, I was gonna say!

35:54.736 --> 35:56.362
Are you feeling any better?

35:56.404 --> 35:58.115
I'm feeling so much better.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.283
Thank you so much
for everything.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.409
My pleasure.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.623
Oh, no.
What?

36:06.665 --> 36:10.335
My ex-girlfriend just walked in
with the new girl she's seeing.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.920
Oh, no.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.548
I can't believe
this is happening.

36:15.590 --> 36:18.176
She's totally flaunting
that she's moved on.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.470
God, I must look like
such a loser.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.514
Trust me, you don't look
like a loser.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.182
But...

36:24.223 --> 36:25.684
But what?

36:25.725 --> 36:28.561
Your ex looks jealous.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.896
I think she thinks
we're together.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.899
I'm sure she doesn't.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.085
I bet she does now.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.253
(chuckles)

36:54.295 --> 36:57.883
Why'd you do that?

36:57.924 --> 36:59.467
I don't know.

36:59.509 --> 37:02.220
You helped me out tonight,
and I wanted to help you.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.936
I can't believe
I was actually thinking

37:09.978 --> 37:12.271
about giving him another chance
after the break.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.398
Why can't I just get it?

37:13.439 --> 37:15.025
He's a player.

37:15.067 --> 37:15.984
Silver, wait, um...

37:17.652 --> 37:20.488
Look, there's something
I gotta tell you.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.329
The truth is...

37:30.623 --> 37:33.835
I like you.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.256
What?

37:38.297 --> 37:43.053
Look, when I said our kiss
didn't mean anything,

37:43.095 --> 37:45.805
I was lying.

37:45.847 --> 37:48.808
I couldn't stop thinking
about it during the break.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.603
Dixon...

37:51.644 --> 37:53.813
No.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.234
Anything and everything I said
during the breakup,

37:57.275 --> 37:58.651
just forget about it.

38:00.153 --> 38:02.280
Because I'm crazy about you.

38:05.283 --> 38:09.829
Silver...

38:09.871 --> 38:12.331
Can you just give me
another chance?

38:18.130 --> 38:20.966
(sobbing)

38:21.007 --> 38:22.508
(chimes)

38:33.478 --> 38:35.313
(grunting)

38:35.354 --> 38:36.689
(clanging)

38:36.731 --> 38:39.234
(sobbing)

38:53.456 --> 38:55.000
I think you're
gonna like Kai.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.127
He's very cute,
very available.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.503
And very coming
towards us right now.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.838
(Kelly giggling)

38:59.879 --> 39:01.006
Debbie.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.715
How are you?
Hey.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.176
I noticed you weren't
in class yesterday.

39:04.217 --> 39:05.177
Is everything okay?

39:05.218 --> 39:06.427
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.679
Harry and I just had a function.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.639
Kai, I want you to meet
my friend, Kelly.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.850
This is Kelly's first time here,
but I told her all about you.

39:11.891 --> 39:12.892
Nice to meet you, Kelly.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.853
So, have you given
any more thought

39:14.894 --> 39:16.813
about the Ojai retreat?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.481
'Cause I think you could really
benefit from those classes.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.692
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna be able to swing it,

39:20.733 --> 39:22.235
but Kelly might be free
that weekend.

39:22.277 --> 39:24.154
Cool.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.446
I better start class.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.535
Well, cute, right?

39:30.576 --> 39:31.870
Totally, yeah,

39:31.911 --> 39:34.831
but he's obviously way into you.

39:34.873 --> 39:39.085
Oh, no, no, don't be ridiculous.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.253
Well, he's a little
touchy-feely,

39:40.295 --> 39:41.587
but that's just
his yoga shtick.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.674
He does that with everybody.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.719
KAI:
Let's all take our
first position, please.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.014
Arms to your side.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.933
Let's close our eyes.

39:53.975 --> 39:58.396
Breathe in...

39:58.437 --> 40:02.234
Out.

40:04.277 --> 40:07.113
Breathe in.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.116
Out.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.378
(kids chattering)

40:21.419 --> 40:22.587
What's going on?

40:22.628 --> 40:24.422
Apparently they're doing
random locker searches.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.924
Something to do
with drugs.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.967
Huh, now what do you suppose
could have prompted that?

40:28.009 --> 40:30.011
No idea.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.472
HARRY:
31-25-32.

40:44.650 --> 40:46.611
This one's clear.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.572
Uh, 143...

40:49.614 --> 40:52.367
...32-37.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.832
Found something here.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not mine.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.752
Navid, is this your locker?

41:02.794 --> 41:04.170
Well, yeah,
but that's impossible.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.797
You better come with us.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.506
No...
Come on.

41:07.548 --> 41:08.716
Let's go.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.760
Come on.
Okay, it's not
what you think.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.096
Can I please explain?
