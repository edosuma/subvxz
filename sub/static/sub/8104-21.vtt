WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.670
He is not sick.

00:03.796 --> 00:06.673
Dr. Riley is throwing up.
He obviously can't lecture.

00:06.799 --> 00:09.425
You witnessed the spew or
do you just have his word for it?

00:09.551 --> 00:11.344
I think I'm coming down
with a little bit of the clap.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.887
I may have to go home for a few days.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.515
Dr. Riley doesn't have
a history of lying to me.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.309
You said this is the fifth time
he's missed a class this year.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.769
Either he's dying or he's lying.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.854
I'll give you two hours off
clinic duty.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.899
Fine. I'll have Cameron do it.
She loves inspiring the inspired.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.359
You'll do it.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.860
Why is it always me?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.278
Because the world hates you.

00:29.405 --> 00:31.489
Or because it's a class on diagnostics.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.909
Pick whichever reason feeds
your narcissism better.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.078
I'm not doing it.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.884
You're supposed to stop me.
Renegotiate.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.594
And you were supposed
to keep on walking.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.681
Sorry. I guess we both screwed up.
Go on. Do it again.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.851
I'll do the lecture
for four hours off clinic.

00:59.977 --> 01:03.312
Two. I know you'd rather spend
a couple of hours

01:03.439 --> 01:05.857
listening to yourself
than listening to patients.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.986
Class starts in 20 minutes.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.614
Dr. House, there's a patient.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.616
I'm outta here. Take it up with Cuddy.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.660
Greg.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.418
Hi, Stacy.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.920
How you doing?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.507
How am I doing?

01:31.967 --> 01:34.844
Well, the last five years
have been like...

01:34.970 --> 01:37.764
You ever see those
"Girls Gone Wild" videos?

01:37.890 --> 01:41.893
Your life's been like that, or your
life's been spent watching them?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.857
I have missed you.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.402
Is that why you're here?

01:56.158 --> 01:57.992
I need your help.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.254
Who am I looking at?

02:10.380 --> 02:12.048
My husband.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.180
Who is suffering abdominal pain
and fainting spells.

02:20.224 --> 02:23.476
No sign of tumors, no vasculitis.

02:23.602 --> 02:26.103
Could be indigestion.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.189
Or maybe a kidney stone.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.316
Little one can pack a lot of wallop.

02:30.442 --> 02:33.361
Did you think
I wasn't going to get married?

02:34.696 --> 02:36.906
Not to someone so poorly endowed.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.367
This guy's pancreas is pathetic.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.915
There is no kidney stone,
no indigestion.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.544
Three hospitals, five doctors.
Not one of them found anything.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.170
Maybe there's nothing to be found.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.713
Right. You suddenly trust doctors,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.507
love puppies
and long walks in the rain.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.634
Walks are out.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.555
I was around you long enough to know
when something's not right.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.931
Mark's had personality changes.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.684
He's acting strange, disconnected.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.394
Interesting.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.437
Means there's
either a neurological component,

03:08.564 --> 03:10.189
or he's having an affair.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.859
No affair. No nothing. He's sick.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.238
I know you're not too busy.
You avoid work like the plague.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.740
Unless it actually is the plague.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.868
I'm asking you a favor.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.829
I'm not too busy.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.625
But I'm not sure I want him to live.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.880
It's good seeing you again.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.517
Three guys walk into a clinic.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.438
Their legs hurt.
What's wrong with them?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.651
I'm not gonna like you, am I?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.403
The most likely cause of leg pain is
muscle strain.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.114
Apply heat and rest affected areas.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.784
Statistically, you're right. Very good.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.954
My experience, over half of leg pain is
musculoskeletal,

04:48.080 --> 04:50.247
generally from excessive exercise,

04:50.374 --> 04:53.918
12 percent is varicose veins
brought on by pregnancy,

04:54.044 --> 04:57.421
and most of the rest is the result of
vehicular accidents.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.966
I said three people. That's six legs.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.551
So you've got three hurt jogging,

05:02.678 --> 05:05.346
two in collisions,
and one of the legs is pregnant.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.224
What were they doing
when pain presented?

05:08.350 --> 05:09.350
I have no idea.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.394
You didn't ask?
You didn't take a history?

05:11.520 --> 05:15.898
Of course. But all that told us is
what they said happened.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.902
Person A, farmer,
says he was fixing a fence.

05:22.906 --> 05:25.449
Tightness in the ankle,
loss of muscle control.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.871
Person B, volleyball practice.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.295
Coach figured it was a pulled muscle.

05:38.422 --> 05:42.383
And C,
we've got Carmen Electra golfing.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.427
Yes!

05:44.553 --> 05:47.346
Whoa. You treated
the "Baywatch" chick?

05:47.472 --> 05:50.391
The "Baywatch" thespian. And no.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.728
I gotta disguise the identity of
each of the patients,

05:53.854 --> 05:55.813
and I got tired of using
the middle-aged man.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.150
Carmen seemed like
a pleasant alternative.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.694
Also, she's apparently
quite the golfer.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.905
In less than two hours,
one of these three

06:05.032 --> 06:06.782
will be tossed out of
the hospital because

06:06.908 --> 06:08.743
they were faking it to score narcotics,

06:08.869 --> 06:12.872
and one will be very close to death.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.625
Any guesses on which is which?

06:17.961 --> 06:20.629
Okay, I say we start with the farmer.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.634
Did you hike to the fence, and how far?

06:25.761 --> 06:29.180
Yes. It's about a half a mile
from my farmhouse.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.015
And where is the pain localized?

06:31.141 --> 06:34.894
It started just above my ankle,
and it's radiating up.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.896
So, what should we do first?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.355
Family history?

06:38.482 --> 06:40.900
Indicative of leg pain?
That's a very short list.

06:41.026 --> 06:44.028
Any history of bone cancer,
osteogenesis imperfecta

06:44.154 --> 06:46.238
or multiple myeloma?

06:46.364 --> 06:47.698
Could be a blood issue.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.909
We should run a CBC and a D-Dimer.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.202
And get an MRI.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.661
MRI or a PET scan?

06:52.788 --> 06:53.746
If the problem's vascular,
he's better off...

06:53.872 --> 06:56.832
Sorry. Thanks for playing.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.585
Patient's dead. You killed him.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.798
We had no time to run any tests.
There was nothing we could do.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.383
You had time to look at the leg.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.766
I thought we were starting with
the farmer's case first.

07:13.892 --> 07:17.019
We are.
But if we're gonna look at a leg...

07:17.145 --> 07:19.980
I need you to take off your pants.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.260
Puncture.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.386
Snake bite.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.720
That would be my guess.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.139
Farmer didn't know
he'd been bitten by a snake?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.265
That's what he said.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.642
Sudden shooting pain, tall grass.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.227
Never saw a thing.

07:58.353 --> 07:59.395
What kind of snake?

07:59.521 --> 08:00.896
You want me to tell you
what kind of snake it was

08:01.022 --> 08:02.606
from the shape of the hole in the leg?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.650
Well, how are we supposed to know
what kind of antivenom to use

08:04.776 --> 08:05.943
if we don't know
what kind of snake it is?

08:06.069 --> 08:09.113
Oh, there are people
to find those things out.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.448
Shouldn't we wait for
the Humane Society or something?

08:11.575 --> 08:14.076
Guy might only have a couple of hours.

08:21.126 --> 08:24.753
And while we wait for
the Humane Society to show up,

08:24.880 --> 08:27.715
let's say we check in
on the volleyball player.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.926
You have tendinitis.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.304
How old is this person?

08:33.430 --> 08:35.723
I mean,
it's not really a 40-year-old man

08:35.849 --> 08:36.891
on a girls' volleyball team, right?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.018
It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.644
Well, I was just worried that...

08:40.770 --> 08:44.023
Would you worry about her more
if she was younger?

08:44.608 --> 08:47.735
Well, obviously, we should care about
all our patients, no matter what age...

08:47.861 --> 08:49.278
Yeah, right.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.280
I saw the way
you were looking at Carmen.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.907
She's mine. Stay away.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.868
Would you operate on your mother?

08:56.661 --> 08:58.245
Of course not.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.956
I'd be too nervous.
Couldn't be objective.

09:01.082 --> 09:05.002
Then why are you so anxious to treat
every patient like they're family?

09:05.253 --> 09:07.504
The actual patient is 16.

09:07.631 --> 09:11.008
Here's what happens
when doctors care too much.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.011
I need to know everything about you.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.306
I went back
three generations.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.935
No history of cancer, Parkinson's
or any other degenerative condition,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.103
but there's this boy at school,
and he's on the boys' volleyball team

09:23.230 --> 09:25.231
and they made out at a party,
and now he won't call her back.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.440
And this friend of hers at school

09:26.566 --> 09:29.193
said this boy didn't like her
and never did.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.986
You got all this
from an examination of the knee?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.154
I think she's depressed.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.364
She doesn't have tendinitis?

09:33.490 --> 09:34.573
She has tendinitis.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.699
She's depressed about
having tendinitis?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
She's depressed for the same reason
that she has tendinitis.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.453
- Not the boy?
- No, the boy's a jerk.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.747
She knows that,
and yet she's depressed.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.582
I found a nodule.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.708
Ah.

09:45.085 --> 09:48.045
Problems with the thyroid gland
causes depressed mental state,

09:48.171 --> 09:50.798
can cause inflammation of the tendons.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.841
I'll run the tests.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.719
So because she took
such an extreme interest,

09:55.845 --> 09:58.180
she found out that the person
had a thyroid condition.

09:58.306 --> 10:03.310
No. Because she took such an interest,
she discovered a tiny nodule,

10:03.436 --> 10:06.730
which in reality signified nothing,
but gave us no choice

10:06.856 --> 10:11.318
but to put a person with tendinitis
through an expensive and painful test.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.911
Here's how a well-adjusted doctor
handles a case.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.877
Can I put my pants back on now?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.921
I'd rather you didn't.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.132
Which Carmen Electra is this?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.509
The first one, the golfer.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.762
Then why isn't she wearing pants?

10:39.889 --> 10:43.183
You have decreased reflexes
in your patellar tendon.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.393
Anyone?

10:44.519 --> 10:45.728
Slipped disc.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.272
Could be. How bad does it hurt?

10:48.398 --> 10:49.982
It hurts really, really bad.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.317
Yeah?

10:51.443 --> 10:54.820
It doesn't seem real.
Is she the one faking?

10:54.946 --> 10:57.406
Oh, for God's sake.
She's here to play into my fantasy,

10:57.532 --> 10:59.199
not 'cause she's Meryl Streep.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.495
Fine.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.956
What the hell is wrong with me!

11:06.458 --> 11:07.791
Do something!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.587
Too much pain to be a slipped disc.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.339
Could be herniated
and impinging the nerve root.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.799
Or it could be referred pain
from his groin.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.676
Sir, are you getting pain
anywhere else?

11:19.346 --> 11:20.929
He's curling. It's not the back.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.766
- Sir, where are you getting pain?
- Help me!

11:23.892 --> 11:26.560
He's not gonna tell us anything
if we don't get him out of pain.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.853
Give him 50 milligrams of Demerol.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.022
We have no history.
He could be allergic.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.190
What do I do?

11:31.316 --> 11:32.775
We can't diagnose him
while he screams.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.985
Better than killing him
with painkillers.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.081
Apparently, he's not allergic.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.044
Thank you. I feel a lot better now.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.341
We screwed up.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.219
No. You did exactly
what his attending did.

12:00.345 --> 12:01.929
And that was
the proper way to handle the case?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.013
Yeah.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.556
The guy used him as a dealer.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.851
You're gonna see a lot of drug-seeking
behavior in your practice.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.896
And there's a reason. It works.

12:11.022 --> 12:13.774
Meanwhile, back on the farm...

12:18.613 --> 12:21.281
Yeah, timber rattlesnake.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.285
Four vials of the CroFab antivenom.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.495
Hey, how you doing?

12:26.621 --> 12:28.997
- All right.
- Thank you.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.084
This will start making
you feel better really fast.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.845
He's having
an allergic reaction. Bag.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.390
Paddles and epi.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.851
His heart's fine.
It's not gonna stay that way.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.979
Paddles!

12:59.070 --> 13:04.158
What say we take five,
get some coffee, go pee.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.002
You didn't think
she was gonna get married?

13:16.004 --> 13:18.172
She asked me the same question.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.969
And what? You're not gonna treat him?

13:26.139 --> 13:28.390
There's probably nothing wrong
with him.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.766
Oh, sure, that makes sense.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.227
She's just using
the old sick-husband routine

13:32.353 --> 13:35.105
as an excuse
to get back in touch with you.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.232
You think this is easy for her?

13:37.358 --> 13:39.985
The only reason she'd be anywhere
near you is if she was desperate.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.654
So I should help her
because she hates me?

13:42.780 --> 13:45.824
She doesn't hate you. She loves you.

13:45.950 --> 13:51.872
She just can't stand to be around you.

13:55.502 --> 13:59.379
Dr. House,
it's been almost six minutes.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.057
Found him.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.310
The volleyball player

14:14.312 --> 14:16.563
was responding to
the anti-inflammatories

14:16.731 --> 14:18.982
as you'd expect
in a case of tendinitis.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.110
What about the snake-bite guy?

14:22.237 --> 14:24.821
I don't really care
about the volleyball player.

14:24.948 --> 14:28.158
What if I told you the volleyball
player had a sudden massive stroke?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.619
- Really?
- No.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.955
But that would make you interested,
right?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.040
What if her T4 came back low?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.375
It's not quite as interesting,

14:36.501 --> 14:37.876
but it has the benefit of being true.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.754
You said the thyroid biopsy
was a wasted test.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.091
No, I didn't. I said
she put a person with tendinitis

14:44.217 --> 14:46.176
through an expensive and painful test.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.763
Apparently, the patient had tendinitis
and a thyroid condition.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.223
We're gonna start you on thyroxine.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.059
It'll make you feel better
and level your moods.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.563
Thank you.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.992
So that's it?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.910
You were right the first time.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.413
Snake-bite guy's way more interesting.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.331
Gross, actually.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.544
The patient
responded to epinephrine,

15:20.670 --> 15:22.963
and the allergic reaction was arrested.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.632
Unfortunately, the patient
continues to deteriorate.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.801
Maybe the snake wrangler was wrong
about the type we caught.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.595
He faxed us a venom test.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.055
Confirmed. It's a timber rattlesnake.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.310
No, it's not. Notice the volume?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.937
I skimmed over that
and the gender and the coloring.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.772
Jumped right to the name of the snake.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.983
Two hundred milligrams.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.319
Our guy got bit
less than four hours ago.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.864
There's no way a snake regenerates
that much venom that quickly.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.949
We're supposed to know how fast
snakes make their venom?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.200
No.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.787
Unless you've got a patient bit by one.
Then it might be helpful.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.997
So what do we do now?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.458
He must have been bitten
by a different snake.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.001
We go back and find it.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.586
Or you go online, and you find

16:02.712 --> 16:04.713
there's only three poisonous snakes
common in New Jersey,

16:04.839 --> 16:07.799
the copperhead,
timber rattler and the coral.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.801
Copperhead and timber rattler
both respond

16:09.927 --> 16:11.678
to the antivenoms we gave the guy.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.972
So we give him the antivenom
for the other one.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.098
Is that a question?

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
Well, we can't just blindly give him
another antivenom,

16:17.477 --> 16:19.436
especially after the first one
almost killed him.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.812
You said only three types of

16:20.938 --> 16:23.315
poisonous snakes
commonly found in New Jersey.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.400
Well, what if this is an uncommon one?

16:25.526 --> 16:26.526
Very good.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.653
We gotta find the right snake.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.322
No need.
Odds are by the time you get back,

16:30.448 --> 16:32.866
the autopsy results will tell you
what kind of snake it was.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.825
But you said...

16:33.951 --> 16:37.287
So we do give him the antivenom
for the other one?

16:37.413 --> 16:40.290
Again, was that a question?
I asked what you would do.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.794
It seems unfair for you to ask me
what you would do.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.172
Who gives the guy the other antivenom?

16:48.508 --> 16:51.426
And who goes looking for the snake?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.805
I assume that one choice kills him,
the other one saves him.

16:54.931 --> 16:58.809
That's usually the way it works
at the leg-turning-black stage.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.938
So half of us killed him,
and half of us saved his life.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.899
- Yeah.
- We can't be blamed...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.402
I'm sure this goes against everything
you've been taught,

17:08.528 --> 17:11.071
but right and wrong do exist.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.990
Just because you don't know
what the right answer is,

17:14.117 --> 17:15.951
maybe there's even no way you could
know what the right answer is,

17:16.077 --> 17:18.787
doesn't make your answer right
or even okay.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.831
It's much simpler than that.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.125
It's just plain wrong.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.713
We gave the guy the antivenom.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.423
What if I'm allergic again?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.967
That's why these people are here.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.095
If you have a reaction, we're ready to
do whatever's necessary

17:35.221 --> 17:38.265
to ensure your airways stay open
and your heart keeps beating.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.101
My wife's on her way in.
Can't this wait?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.854
I'm sorry. It can't.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.844
It hurts again.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.596
He came back?

18:18.848 --> 18:21.933
On average, drug addicts are stupid.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.894
I'd call the cops.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.479
Good for you.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.148
A lot of doctors wouldn't risk
their careers on a hunch.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.692
It's not a hunch. I mean,
I know he wants drugs.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.986
Well, even drug addicts get sick.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.280
Actually, for some reason,

18:35.406 --> 18:38.533
they tend to get sick more often
than non-drug addicts.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.954
Luckily,
you don't have to play your hunch.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.331
There's a faster way.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.624
Actually, there are several.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.626
My preference is urine testing.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.961
But you already know
he has drugs in his system.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.880
That's not what I'm testing for.

18:52.006 --> 18:53.882
We're gonna put this hard rubber tube

18:54.008 --> 18:56.343
up your urethra and into your bladder.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.844
It may be a little uncomfortable.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.930
Shouldn't I be getting
some sort of anesthetic?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.850
We're concerned about
allergic reactions today.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.819
If the guy can handle
a rod in his penis

19:13.945 --> 19:16.363
for half an hour, he's really sick.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.448
Or he's really jonesing.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.492
There's easier ways
to get a hold of drugs.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.868
Other hospitals, for example.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.291
The volleyball player
is not responding to treatment.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.587
At least we think it's not working

19:32.713 --> 19:35.507
on account of the fact
that she's getting worse.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.050
Can you still hear me?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.510
No.

19:38.636 --> 19:39.636
A little!

19:39.762 --> 19:40.929
Not really!

19:42.765 --> 19:45.100
Well, if you can't hear me,
how do you know what I asked?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.561
I'm sorry. What did I do?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.187
I don't know. It really hurts.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.398
I promise to be very careful.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.066
Susan...

19:53.192 --> 19:54.860
Not her real name!

19:54.986 --> 19:56.862
Susan, I barely touched you.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.282
- It hurts so much!
- I'm sorry.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.951
I have to get this blood. Just hold on.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.995
Hypersensitivity to touch.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.079
Her calcium up?

20:06.205 --> 20:07.372
Lab over 16.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.791
Question is why. Likely suspects?

20:09.917 --> 20:10.959
Parathyroid adenoma.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.419
- Kidney problems.
- Vit D intoxication.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.962
- Hyperthyroid.
- Caused by our treatment?

20:14.088 --> 20:16.882
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can you please slow down?

20:21.888 --> 20:24.806
The adenoma is most likely.

20:24.932 --> 20:30.270
Check her PTH,
phosphorus and ionized calcium.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.148
And do a technetium sestamibi.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.192
Okay, that's enough
about the volleyball player.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.028
What's up with the farmer?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.363
What farmer?

20:40.489 --> 20:42.657
Snake-bite guy.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.743
Oh, right, you guys
don't know about him.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.036
He doesn't get bitten
until three months

20:46.162 --> 20:48.288
after we treat the volleyball player.

20:48.414 --> 20:52.542
Luckily, it's been well-established
that time is not a fixed construct.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.295
His condition's not improving.
Double the dosage.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.379
Already did.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.465
There's another antivenom.
It's not as effective...

20:58.591 --> 20:59.591
Already tried it.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.176
The first stuff,
the stuff he was allergic to.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.053
Gave it to him with high-dose steroids.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.804
Nothing's working.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.306
What does it all mean?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.974
Wrong snake?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.018
We tried every other antivenom we had.

21:10.144 --> 21:10.977
We're too late?

21:11.103 --> 21:14.814
Yep. He's dying. His wife's here.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.691
Finally found a babysitter.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.610
Who wants to let them know?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.904
Actually, I'm kidding.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.364
He's not dying?

21:22.740 --> 21:25.659
Oh, yeah, he's dying,
but there's no wife and kid,

21:25.785 --> 21:27.327
which is great.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.414
Makes the breaking-the-news thing
way easier.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.000
Oh, yeah. One more piece of news.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.676
The drug addict is peeing blood.

21:48.057 --> 21:52.060
How do they teach you how to tell
someone that they're dying?

21:54.897 --> 21:56.690
It's kind of like teaching architects

21:56.816 --> 21:59.651
how to explain
why their building fell down.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.862
Do you role-play and stuff?

22:02.989 --> 22:06.241
Yeah. One of us gives the bad news,
and one of us gets the bad news.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.704
What do you have to do to get an A in
You're-Dying 101?

22:10.830 --> 22:14.457
They grade you on
gentleness and supportiveness?

22:14.583 --> 22:18.128
Is there a scale
for measuring compassion?

22:20.047 --> 22:21.923
This buddy of mine,

22:22.049 --> 22:25.969
I gotta give him 10 bucks every time
someone says thank you.

22:26.679 --> 22:30.140
Imagine that. This guy's so good,

22:30.266 --> 22:33.977
people thank him for telling them
hat they're dying.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.441
Needs brown.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.652
I don't get thanked that often.

22:43.529 --> 22:44.988
You're dying.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.324
In a few hours.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.872
There's nothing we can do
except deal with the pain.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.916
Well, I need to go home.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.960
You're not going home.

23:00.337 --> 23:04.507
But my dog.
What will happen to my dog?

23:10.723 --> 23:12.599
Her neck looks clean. No adenoma.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.976
Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying,

23:15.102 --> 23:17.228
and all he cares about is his dog?

23:19.815 --> 23:24.152
Any of you guys go the dog route
in your improv sessions?

23:24.695 --> 23:29.532
It's a basic truth of the human
condition that everybody lies.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.495
The only variable is about what.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.039
The great thing about telling someone
they're dying

23:36.165 --> 23:39.751
is that it tends
to focus their priorities.

23:40.377 --> 23:43.338
You find out what matters to them,

23:43.506 --> 23:46.674
what they're willing to die for.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.345
What they're willing to lie for.

23:50.471 --> 23:51.971
You must have a neighbor who can...

23:52.098 --> 23:54.057
Neighbors don't like him.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.143
So the Humane Society will take him in
and find him a home.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.937
No, they won't.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.943
Yeah, but maybe, maybe my aunt...

24:05.069 --> 24:07.320
It wasn't a snakebite, was it?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.282
I said I don't remember being bit.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.993
Sure you do. Just not by a snake.

24:15.037 --> 24:19.082
I assume that Cujo bit one of
your neighbors a while back.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.876
You tell me that he bit you,
and I gotta report it.

24:22.002 --> 24:25.046
Cujo's got a record. He gets the chair.

24:27.550 --> 24:30.885
The good news is you might just live.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.096
The bad news is your dog's gonna die.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.058
Guy risked his life to save this thing?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.814
I'll hold him. You swab the mouth.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.399
I think I've got a better grip here.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.359
You go for the mouth.

24:46.861 --> 24:48.444
All right. I'm odds.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.821
Are you serious?

24:49.947 --> 24:51.281
Come on, one, two, three!

24:51.407 --> 24:52.574
Damn.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.952
I don't care if he's scratching
your nads off, you don't let go.

24:56.078 --> 24:57.620
Just do it!

25:01.667 --> 25:02.917
I say we let the guy die.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.335
I got his head. Just do it.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.045
Got it.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.802
What would you call that?

25:13.888 --> 25:15.805
It's tea-colored, right?

25:17.016 --> 25:20.143
The guy who we thought
was just after the drugs...

25:21.312 --> 25:25.773
What's the differential diagnosis
for urine that's tea-colored?

25:25.900 --> 25:27.734
Kidney stone.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.944
Kidney stones would cause what?

25:30.070 --> 25:31.362
Blood in urine.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.282
- What color is your pee?
- Yellow.

25:34.408 --> 25:36.451
- What color is your blood?
- Red.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.704
- What colors did I use?
- Red, yellow and brown.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.748
And brown.
What causes brown?

25:41.874 --> 25:42.916
Waste.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.335
Which means the kidneys
are shutting down. Why?

25:45.461 --> 25:47.128
- Trauma.
- None that his history would indicate.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.839
Could be damage done
by the self-injection of the Demerol.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.466
- Treatment?
- Heat and rest...

25:51.592 --> 25:52.550
Other possible causes?

25:52.676 --> 25:53.593
Infection.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.012
Start him on antibiotics. What else?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.264
Come on! Come on!

25:58.432 --> 25:59.766
I don't know.

25:59.892 --> 26:03.728
You're useless,
but at least you know it.

26:03.854 --> 26:06.564
Blood tests show elevated creatine
kinase. What does that tell you?

26:06.690 --> 26:08.149
The trauma diagnosis was right.

26:08.275 --> 26:09.776
He takes it easy for a few days,
he'll be fine.

26:09.902 --> 26:10.985
You sure?

26:11.111 --> 26:12.403
The elevated CK rules out infection.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.405
You know what's worse than useless?

26:14.531 --> 26:16.699
Useless and oblivious.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.911
What are they missing?

26:20.037 --> 26:22.705
You know, it's kind of hard to think
when you're in our face like...

26:22.831 --> 26:23.915
Yeah? You think it's gonna be easier

26:24.041 --> 26:26.751
when you got a real patient
really dying?

26:26.877 --> 26:28.044
What are you missing?

26:28.587 --> 26:29.796
Muscle death.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.177
Not your case.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.137
Nothing wrong with a consult.

26:40.224 --> 26:44.477
Dying muscle leaks myoglobin.
It's toxic to the kidneys.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.938
Brilliant.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.025
MRI his leg.
See what's killing it.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.366
Why is the girl getting the MRI?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.034
Because the neck scan
revealed nothing,

27:00.160 --> 27:03.746
and her doctor's way more obsessive
than she thinks she is.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.248
But you said the guy needed the MRI.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.583
Because Dr. Cameron back there
said muscle death.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.335
Not one of you said it.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.379
Not one of this guy's doctors said it.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.633
They gave him bed rest and antibiotics,
just like you guys would have.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.385
Did he get better?

27:17.511 --> 27:18.511
No.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.180
- How long...
- Three days.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.227
It is in the nature of medicine that
you are gonna screw up.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.104
You are gonna kill someone.

27:29.023 --> 27:32.358
If you can't handle that reality,
pick another profession.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.278
Or finish medical school and teach.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.529
Three days

27:36.655 --> 27:38.406
before they thought
it might have been muscle death?

27:38.532 --> 27:40.658
No, three days before the patient

27:40.784 --> 27:42.952
suggested
it might have been muscle death.

27:46.915 --> 27:50.793
The MRI revealed an osteosarcoma.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.212
A cancerous tumor on your femur.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.923
It needs to be removed surgically.

27:56.050 --> 27:59.802
With chemo, she has an excellent
chance of survival.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.846
But I have to warn you, depending on

28:01.972 --> 28:05.266
how large the tumor is
and how ingrained it is,

28:07.269 --> 28:10.146
the surgeon may need to
amputate your leg.

28:11.565 --> 28:13.566
I'm sorry.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.152
It's okay.

28:22.493 --> 28:25.703
Dogs' mouths are pretty filthy,
but they have natural antibodies

28:25.829 --> 28:27.914
to fight off most of the stuff.
We don't.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.166
That's why dog bites can be so nasty.

28:30.292 --> 28:34.087
The lab tests of your dog's saliva
revealed a type of strep bacteria.

28:34.213 --> 28:37.673
It's commonly known as
the flesh-eating disease.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.718
We'll need to operate immediately to
remove the damaged tissue.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.137
We may need to remove the leg.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.981
The MRI revealed a problem.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.191
No kidding.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.360
I'm sorry none of your doctors
found it earlier.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.821
I am personally gonna oversee
your treatment from now on.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.573
You're gonna cut me open, aren't you?

29:04.868 --> 29:07.161
We may need to remove the leg.

29:17.673 --> 29:22.802
His MRI showed that the leg pain
wasn't caused by the self-injection.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.555
It wasn't caused by an infection.

29:27.683 --> 29:33.354
It was an aneurysm that clotted,
leading to an infarction.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.108
My God, you were right. It's House.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.820
We have to do the surgery.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.281
The necrotic tissue has to be removed.

29:43.407 --> 29:44.490
If there's too much...

29:44.616 --> 29:46.451
I don't care what you find.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.870
It may become necessary
in order to save your life.

29:48.996 --> 29:51.539
I like my leg.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.916
I've had it for as long as
I can remember.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.960
Honey, I love your leg
as much as you do.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.212
They're not cutting it off.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.344
The patient made the right choice.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.222
Tell a surgeon
that it's okay to cut a leg off,

30:08.348 --> 30:11.058
and he's gonna spend the night
polishing his good hacksaw.

30:11.185 --> 30:14.270
Right. Surgeons could care less
about saving limbs.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.105
Of course they care about
their patients,

30:16.231 --> 30:18.274
they just care about themselves more,

30:18.734 --> 30:21.235
which is not an unreasonable position.

30:21.361 --> 30:23.488
Trying to maximize the tissue you save

30:23.614 --> 30:26.407
also maximizes the chances of
something going wrong,

30:26.533 --> 30:28.826
which means
you've gotta be extra careful,

30:28.994 --> 30:31.078
which is such a pain in the ass.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.749
Amazing advances have been made.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.377
Kids with prosthetic legs are running
the 100-meter dash in 12 seconds.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.005
Yeah, they're just not as pretty.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.842
Do a bypass. Restore the circulation.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.344
Amputation is safer.

30:46.470 --> 30:47.803
For you or me?

30:47.930 --> 30:49.055
The blockage of blood flow...

30:49.181 --> 30:50.848
Four-day blockage.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.809
Yes. It caused muscle cell death.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.604
When those cells die, they release
cytokines and potassium.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.524
And if you restore the blood flow
instead of just lopping it all off,

30:59.650 --> 31:01.651
then all that crap gets washed back
into my system.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.986
The cytokines could cause
organ failure.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.947
The potassium could cause
cardiac arrest.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.700
On the other hand, I may just get
the use of my leg back.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.953
The postoperative pain alone...

31:12.079 --> 31:12.912
I'll get through it.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.872
I understand the risks.
You're in the clear.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.916
Go schedule an OR.

31:23.674 --> 31:25.758
God, you're an idiot.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.135
I think I'm more of a jerk.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.930
I'm not being glib,
and I'm not being cute.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.266
I don't want you to kill yourself.

31:34.768 --> 31:35.893
I'm not gonna die.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.228
Oh.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.647
I feel completely reassured.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.760
More suction.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.932
Inserting now.

33:21.083 --> 33:24.168
They gotta up the morphine.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.836
Doctors say they can't.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.215
Doctors who recommended
bed rest and antibiotics.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.342
They screwed up. It doesn't mean
they're wrong this time.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.843
Sure doesn't mean they're right.

33:32.969 --> 33:33.928
Morphine will kill you.

33:34.054 --> 33:35.096
I can handle it.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.597
You're in pain.
You're not thinking right.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.683
That's why I need the damn morphine!

33:38.809 --> 33:41.227
Okay. I'll talk to them.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.817
Oh, my God. How much longer is
the pain gonna last?

33:47.943 --> 33:49.944
It depends on how much
muscle cell death there was.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.779
He could be right.
He could come out of this

33:51.905 --> 33:53.614
with almost full use of his leg.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.990
Or?

33:56.034 --> 33:58.953
He could be in pain
for the rest of his life.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.542
There's a third option, surgically.

34:04.668 --> 34:08.087
A middle ground between
what we did and amputation.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.676
He's not big on middle ground.

34:14.761 --> 34:15.886
Yeah.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.123
Nurse.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.875
I need more calcium gluconate.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.626
You just had five mls.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.171
The QRS is getting wider.
My potassium is rising.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.380
I'll talk to your doctor.

34:51.506 --> 34:52.506
Well, you better make it fast,

34:52.632 --> 34:54.759
'cause I'm about to go into
cardiac arrest.

34:54.885 --> 34:58.929
You give me the dose,
or I go into wide complex tachycardia.

34:59.055 --> 35:00.097
I could get in trouble.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.223
Listen, it's not a narcotic!

35:01.349 --> 35:03.559
I'm not looking for a buzz.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.311
You got about 20 seconds.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.028
I was wrong.

35:19.951 --> 35:20.910
What do you got?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.203
Wide complex tachycardia.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.913
- Who diagnosed...
- He did.

35:24.039 --> 35:26.207
- Defibrillator.
- Paddles.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.875
Charge. Clear.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.759
The patient was technically dead
for over a minute.

36:11.795 --> 36:12.962
He's back.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.262
Do you think he was dead?

36:22.055 --> 36:24.807
Do you think
those experiences were real?

36:26.059 --> 36:27.977
Define "real."

36:28.687 --> 36:31.146
They were real experiences.

36:31.273 --> 36:33.774
What they meant...

36:33.900 --> 36:35.025
Personally, I choose to believe

36:35.151 --> 36:37.570
that the white light
people sometimes see,

36:37.696 --> 36:40.614
the visions this patient saw,

36:40.740 --> 36:42.116
they're all just chemical reactions

36:42.242 --> 36:44.660
that take place
while the brain shuts down.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.746
You choose to believe that?

36:48.039 --> 36:50.082
There's no conclusive science.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.168
My choice has no practical relevance
to my life.

36:53.295 --> 36:56.171
I choose the outcome
I find more comforting.

36:56.298 --> 36:59.967
You find it more comforting to believe
that this is it?

37:00.093 --> 37:06.015
I find it more comforting to believe
that this isn't simply a test.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.356
How bad is the pain right now?

37:15.150 --> 37:16.609
It's bad.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.860
It's not getting any better.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.029
If you were right,
the pain would be subsiding.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.405
You'd be getting better.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.157
It's just taking longer.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.242
No, it's not.

37:26.036 --> 37:29.121
We've gotta let them cut the leg off.

37:31.291 --> 37:35.002
It's my leg. It's my life.

37:36.379 --> 37:38.047
Would you give up your leg
to save my life?

37:38.173 --> 37:40.007
Of course I would.

37:40.133 --> 37:43.677
Then why do you think your life is
worth less than mine?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.347
If this were any other patient,

37:46.473 --> 37:48.432
what would you tell them to do?

37:53.146 --> 37:54.730
I would say it's their choice.

37:54.856 --> 37:56.398
For... Not a chance.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.651
You'd browbeat them
until they made the choice

37:58.777 --> 38:00.861
you knew was right.

38:00.987 --> 38:05.032
You'd shove it in their face
that it's just a damn leg.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.827
You don't think you deserve to live?

38:09.663 --> 38:12.331
You don't think
you deserve to be happy?

38:13.750 --> 38:16.126
Now let them cut off your leg.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.465
I can't. I can't.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.885
I'm sorry.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.812
The pain alone is gonna kill you.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.731
I know. I know.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.614
I need you to talk to the doctor.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.958
He change his mind?

38:56.084 --> 38:57.459
No.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.964
He's asked to be put in
a chemically-induced coma

39:02.090 --> 39:05.259
so that he can sleep through
the worst part of the pain.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.637
We can do that.

39:11.057 --> 39:14.018
What happens after he's in the coma?

39:14.144 --> 39:16.478
We'll obviously monitor
his condition closely,

39:16.604 --> 39:18.689
and if he can get through
the next 48 hours

39:18.815 --> 39:19.940
without another cardiac incident...

39:20.066 --> 39:21.567
I meant, I'm his health-care proxy.

39:21.693 --> 39:26.071
I get to make medical decisions for him
if he's not able to.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.617
You should talk to him about
what he wants to do.

39:30.744 --> 39:34.496
I know what he wants,
but if he's out, it's my call, right?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.766
You'll be out in less than a minute.

39:58.521 --> 40:00.439
Thank you.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.862
Hey.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.240
I'll see you when I wake up.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.119
We'll go golfing.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.125
I love you.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.505
I love you, too.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.801
I'm sorry.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.641
You've got nothing to be sorry about.

40:53.743 --> 40:56.245
The middle ground
you were talking about...

40:56.371 --> 40:59.081
We go in, take out the dead muscle.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.750
There's still some risk of
reperfusion injury, but...

41:01.876 --> 41:04.294
Give me the forms you need signed.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.175
You're saving his life.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.428
He won't see it that way.

41:31.948 --> 41:36.118
Because of the extent of
the muscle removed,

41:36.911 --> 41:40.747
the utility of the patient's leg
was severely compromised.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.959
Because of the time delay
in making the diagnosis,

41:44.085 --> 41:47.379
the patient continues to experience
chronic pain.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.888
She had no right to do that.

41:56.014 --> 41:56.930
She had the proxy.

41:57.056 --> 41:58.140
She knew he didn't want the surgery.

41:58.266 --> 41:59.224
She saved his life.

41:59.350 --> 42:00.976
Well, we don't know that.
Maybe he would've been fine.

42:01.102 --> 42:03.437
It doesn't matter.
It's the patient's call.

42:03.563 --> 42:05.355
The patient's an idiot.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.192
They usually are.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.236
Do you have a buzzer or something?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.738
What time does this class end?

42:12.864 --> 42:15.199
20 minutes ago.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.956
I'm not doing this again.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.792
And this guy is not
the world's greatest dad.

42:25.919 --> 42:27.794
Not even ranked.

42:27.921 --> 42:30.255
Who the hell lets their kids
play with lead-based paint?

42:30.381 --> 42:31.882
That's why he's always sick.

42:32.008 --> 42:35.719
Find him some plastic cups,
and the class is all his again.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.958
Stacy, it's Greg.

43:06.084 --> 43:10.128
I've got an opening in my calendar
for 10:00 tomorrow morning.

43:10.255 --> 43:13.340
Make sure your husband isn't late.
