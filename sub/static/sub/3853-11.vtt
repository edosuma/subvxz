00:00.001 --> 00:01.912
[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:01.913 --> 00:03.824
It's a traugott research facili.

00:03.825 --> 00:05.736
Our intelligence indicates theye
about to make a major discovery.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.773
And you want us to steal it.

00:07.775 --> 00:11.210
See, we're already finishing
each others thoughts.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.778
Who the hell are these clowns?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.764
They're your new partners.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.749
You guys have any idea
what we're really stealing?

00:20.221 --> 00:22.187
Nice work.

00:23.624 --> 00:24.757
That's my gun.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.525
Not anymore.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.161
[electric shock]

00:32.533 --> 00:35.801
[two] if you think i'm gonna gie
you anything you can forget it.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.570
[wexler]  oh no, no, no, no,
no, not you, your friends.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.572
See, they can either give me th,

00:40.574 --> 00:43.275
Or they can watch you
get blown out into space.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.444
So what's it gonna be, folks?

00:45.446 --> 00:47.329
[two]
don't give him anything.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.213
[wexler] hey, hey, hey,
okay i'll tell you what i'm gon,

00:49.216 --> 00:52.117
I'm gonna count down from
five, and if no body speaks

00:52.119 --> 00:55.154
By the time i get to zero, out .

00:55.156 --> 01:00.726
Five, four, three, two--

01:00.728 --> 01:01.593
M--

01:01.595 --> 01:04.263
Maplethorpe!

01:04.265 --> 01:07.833
The code is maplethorpe, with a"

01:09.203 --> 01:10.769
Check it out.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.212
We did the job.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.547
Why are you doing this?

01:21.549 --> 01:24.583
The collective bounty
on this crew is worth

01:24.585 --> 01:26.285
As much as the device alone.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.554
Plus this way we get to keep th.

01:28.556 --> 01:32.191
It's what i like to call a win-.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.859
[cain]
yeah, it's cain. I'm in.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.694
We got it.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.497
[wexler]
you know it's really too bad,

01:38.499 --> 01:42.534
We could've had some
real fun together.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.470
(screams)

01:44.472 --> 01:45.571
Noooo!!

01:45.573 --> 01:47.406
Settle down!

01:47.408 --> 01:52.578
Settle down now or
she won't be the only one.

01:55.783 --> 02:02.221
Now we're gonna take a little
walk together, nice and slow.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.689
Now move.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.793
Everybody inside the vault.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.804
Hey!

02:30.284 --> 02:32.718
Are we done?!

02:32.720 --> 02:34.720
Son-of-a-bitch broke my nose.

02:34.722 --> 02:35.654
Stand down cain.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.655
You're a dead man.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.724
Stand down cain.

02:44.465 --> 02:48.534
Everybody in the vault, yeah no.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.673
We need to find something
to cut ourselves free.

03:27.675 --> 03:32.744
I have a knife,
it's in my boot.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.680
They never frisked me.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.916
Guess sometimes it pays
not to be taken seriously.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.419
Since when do you
start carrying a knife?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.720
Really?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.722
It's not going to
do us much good

03:43.724 --> 03:45.891
As long as we're
locked in here.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.960
I can't believe she's gone.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.732
He didn't have to kill her.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.000
We gave him the code.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.535
Why did he do that?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.837
Guys like that think they
need to send a message

03:58.839 --> 04:00.806
Keep us from messing with him.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.874
Well he made a mistake,

04:02.876 --> 04:05.811
'cause i'm gonna do a hell
of a lot worse than that.

04:05.813 --> 04:10.582
When we get out of here,
i'm gonna kill 'em all.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.922
I just signaled our
friends at volkov-rusi.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.625
They have our position;
they'll be here in two hours.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.826
Once we offload the device

04:20.828 --> 04:22.828
We'll head to
the nearest g.A. Outpost.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.763
What the hell
happened to you?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.632
Ishida gave him
a little trouble.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.966
Oh yeah, well you'll get revenge

04:27.968 --> 04:30.769
When you cash your
share of the bounty on his head

04:30.771 --> 04:32.904
And not before,
do you understand?

04:32.906 --> 04:34.006
Fine.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.474
Good.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.377
Now, there's
one other thing...

04:42.883 --> 04:44.883
You find anything useful?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.884
Nothing that's gonna
get us through that door.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.791
Half these crates
are still locked.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.295
I tell you when this is all
over i'm gonna get a blowtorch

04:56.297 --> 04:59.331
Come down here and cut
every one of them open.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.766
Back off.

05:06.674 --> 05:08.573
You managed to cut yourselves
free, congratulations.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.610
Yeah, now you guys can scratch
yourselves while you wait for us

05:11.612 --> 05:13.412
To hand you over to the g.A.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.048
Hey, corso, you're coming with .

05:22.323 --> 05:23.973
Let's go.

05:23.974 --> 05:25.624
What are you going
to do with him?

05:25.626 --> 05:27.993
Just a few friendly questions.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.897
Ugh.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.832
You didn't even
ask me anything yet!

05:33.834 --> 05:38.737
Oh i know i know i just ah i
like to set the tone you know.

05:38.739 --> 05:39.871
Ugh!

05:39.873 --> 05:42.374
Gah.

05:42.376 --> 05:44.976
Now, do you remember
a small-time crook

05:44.978 --> 05:46.812
Working out of
the adara sector,

05:46.814 --> 05:48.847
Goes by the name
of danny bones?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.550
If i say no, are you
gonna hit me again?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.819
I just want you to
tell me the truth.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.788
Then no, i don't remember.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.492
Ugh, gah!

06:00.494 --> 06:01.493
Now he remembers you.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.395
He said you
were a big talker,

06:03.397 --> 06:05.063
Especially after you'd
had a few drinks.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.965
In particular, he remembers oneg

06:06.967 --> 06:08.467
Where you both
got quite inebriated,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.635
And you told him
a very interesting story.

06:10.637 --> 06:14.406
About a secret stash
on some uninhabited moon,

06:14.408 --> 06:17.109
Where you've been putting
away loot from all your jobs.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.978
You said it was
worth millions.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.782
I gotta be honest,
it doesn't sound like me.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.101
Really.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.419
Yeah, usually i just blow all
my money on booze and women.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.524
Gah.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.159
I'm not lying.

06:34.161 --> 06:38.029
I don't remember anything
about any secret stash.

06:38.031 --> 06:44.536
So ah, are you telling me
that danny bones is a liar?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.837
Maybe.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.873
Is he a friend of yours?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.875
No.

06:49.877 --> 06:56.081
Then yeah, i'd say he's lying.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.883
Ahh.

06:57.885 --> 07:02.888
This guy's alright eh.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.557
Why don't we just
cut to the chase?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.492
G.A. Wants us for trial.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.529
Which means if you want the bou,
you gotta keep us alive.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.532
You can't push this all
the way and you both know it.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.133
I could always
cut off your fingers.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.668
No.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.202
A couple of cuts
and bruises is one thing,

07:18.205 --> 07:20.906
You try to turn somebody in
who's been maimed and disfigure,

07:20.908 --> 07:24.709
You're gonna have
to give an explanation.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.927
Smart guy, huh?

07:25.928 --> 07:27.144
You've got an
answer for everything.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.181
I know the bounty
on me isn't millions,

07:29.183 --> 07:30.949
But it's a tidy sum.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.218
You're not gonna risk
it on the off chance

07:33.220 --> 07:35.921
That some story
you heard is true.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.522
It's not worth it.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.725
Might be worth it
just to shut you up.

07:40.727 --> 07:42.527
No, he's right.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.346
Seriously?

07:44.347 --> 07:46.164
You're gonna let him talk
you down just like that?

07:46.166 --> 07:47.566
Did i say that?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.134
No.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.169
We're just gonna
try this another way.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.539
Â¶

07:54.541 --> 07:58.510
This is ridiculous.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.146
There's gotta be something
around here we can use.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.214
I already told you.

08:02.216 --> 08:02.981
There's nothing.

08:02.983 --> 08:06.985
Nothing.

08:06.987 --> 08:07.986
What about the vents?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.288
Hmm?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.589
Why don't you
crawl out the vents,

08:10.591 --> 08:11.990
Open the door
from the outside?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.959
There are no
vents in this room.

08:13.961 --> 08:14.960
It's a sealed vault.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.981
That's the whole point.

08:18.982 --> 08:23.001
You might want to calm down,
we've only got so much air.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.004
Come on man, you tell me
to calm down one more time,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.272
See what it gets you!

08:27.274 --> 08:28.740
Can we not do this?

08:28.742 --> 08:30.041
They blew her out into space!

08:30.043 --> 08:32.277
While we stood
there and watched!

08:32.279 --> 08:33.812
And we did nothing.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.180
What were we
supposed to do?

08:35.182 --> 08:36.147
I don't know.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.984
Fight back, maybe.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.185
Four and i tried.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.820
Unsuccessfully.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.055
So what-- you wanna
just give up now?

08:44.057 --> 08:46.224
No, we're in a position
of severe disadvantage.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.060
The last thing we want
to do is act on emotion.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.130
The whole zen master
thing doesn't work for me.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.734
Awe man bring it.

08:55.736 --> 08:56.568
Back away.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.235
Bring it!

08:57.237 --> 08:59.738
I said back away!

08:59.740 --> 09:01.106
Come on.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.157
What do you want?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.893
Your buddy corso
needs a little company.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.869
See i got the idea
from you, sport.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.171
So, thank you.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.307
Everybody on this ship
is worth money,

09:35.309 --> 09:38.310
Alive and relatively unharmed.

09:38.312 --> 09:40.129
Except for her.

09:40.130 --> 09:41.947
There's no bounty on
her head from what i know,

09:41.949 --> 09:48.186
So unlike the rest of you
she's completely expendable.

09:48.188 --> 09:51.923
So how 'bout we get started.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.064
So i figured we'll start
with one of the little fingers

09:59.066 --> 10:01.133
And we'll go from there.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.201
I don't really have anything
sharp to cut it off cleanly,

10:03.203 --> 10:07.272
So we'll just sort of have
to twist it off, is that okay.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.341
She doesn't know
anything, wexler!

10:09.343 --> 10:10.809
Leave her out of this!

10:10.811 --> 10:12.077
I believe you, i do.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.378
But that's not really the point.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.213
She doesn't have to know anythi.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.048
She just has to feel pain.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.600
What about commander truffault?

10:18.601 --> 10:20.151
How are you gonna
explain this to her?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.387
With any luck i'll never see
commander truffault again.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.357
So you're not just screwing us,
you're screwing mikkei as well.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.192
Where are you gonna sell the de?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.210
Another corp?

10:28.211 --> 10:29.227
You got a better offer?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.996
That's not really any of your b,

10:30.998 --> 10:33.298
And anyway we're kind of
getting off the topic here.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.001
I don't have a secret stash
on some moon somewhere!

10:36.003 --> 10:37.268
I'm telling you the truth!

10:37.270 --> 10:38.737
Mhmm.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.205
Maybe, but i can't
take your word for it.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.907
Now i've heard your rep,
but i'm starting to think

10:42.909 --> 10:44.676
It's all just a bunch of talk.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.945
I don't think there's
anything you'd rather do less

10:46.947 --> 10:48.647
Than watch me hurt this girl.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.783
And anyway we'll know
by the third finger for sure.

10:51.785 --> 10:52.984
Come on.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.253
We both know
you're not gonna do that.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.923
We're thieves,
we're not animals.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.159
Well, you know
there are other things

11:01.161 --> 11:02.994
That cain and i could do to her.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.829
Might even be more fun.

11:04.831 --> 11:09.267
Would you ah like to see that?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.403
You're a sick son-of-a-bitch.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.438
[female thief]
wexler, cain, we've got a probl.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.923
[wexler]
what?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.407
[female thief]
you need to get to the bridge.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.944
[wexler]
just as it was getting interest.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.312
To be continued.

11:29.256 --> 11:32.223
I don't suppose you
have that knife on you?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.458
Six has it.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.026
I'm tied too tight anyway.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.095
Yeah.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.969
I'm sorry about
what happened to two.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.137
I'm sorry you had to see that.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.808
[five panting]

11:49.810 --> 11:53.111
I know she meant a lot to you.

11:54.314 --> 11:58.917
I don't think
i was the only one.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.086
No you weren't.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.293
The ship was going through

12:08.295 --> 12:10.862
Some kind of self-diagnostic
when this came up.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.899
Something to do with
the ftl drive but i can't...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.801
Here let me see.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.278
You understand all that?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.914
Of course.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.316
Well maybe not all of it.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.785
If the ftl drive is
offline... We can't jump.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.788
We can't jump we are screwed.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.356
The volkov-rusi
will be here soon.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.824
Maybe they can help us.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.392
Or maybe they'll just take the ,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.361
Keep the payment
and leave us stranded.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.397
We can't trust them.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.533
We could re-activate
the android.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.869
It's too dangerous.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.537
What about the hostages?

12:52.539 --> 12:55.507
Maybe one of them can help.

12:56.543 --> 13:00.211
You know,
the android once told me

13:00.213 --> 13:02.413
That when all this caught up wi,
i'd be the lucky one,

13:02.415 --> 13:05.984
Because i wasn't one
of the original crew.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.921
It's kinda funny how it turned
out to be the exact opposite.

13:09.923 --> 13:14.225
Hey, i'm just gonna tell them
i'm not the real jace corso.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.493
That'll make them back off.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.395
You'll never convince them.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.497
I have the dna scan.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.299
I'll make them believe me.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.067
And what good would that do?

13:23.069 --> 13:27.005
Then you'll just be expendable .

13:28.475 --> 13:32.310
Look i'm not just gonna sit
here and let them hurt you.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.145
I'd rather that than
you sacrifice yourself

13:34.147 --> 13:38.516
For no reason.

13:38.518 --> 13:43.421
Please, please, just when they
get back, keep your mouth shut.

13:43.423 --> 13:47.525
Sorry, i can't do it.

13:47.527 --> 13:52.130
You know you may not be
one of the original crew,

13:52.132 --> 13:55.433
Technically i'm not either,

13:55.435 --> 13:59.404
But you're definitely one of
the bravest people on this ship.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.906
You're in luck, kid.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.407
Looks like you got
a chance to prove

14:02.409 --> 14:05.476
You're not so expendable after .

14:12.052 --> 14:13.518
Well?

14:13.520 --> 14:16.087
If i help you,
and you get the drive back,

14:16.089 --> 14:17.856
What's to stop you
from killing me?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.357
Oh no, no,
no, no, no.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.359
See you're looking
at this all wrong okay.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.862
If you help us and
we get the drive back,

14:23.864 --> 14:25.864
Then you'll have shown
that you're useful enough

14:25.866 --> 14:27.749
To keep around.

14:27.750 --> 14:29.633
But if you don't,
i definitely will kill you.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.217
Yeah, that's what i thought.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.402
What is it?

14:47.403 --> 14:48.586
We've had this problem before.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.388
One of the forward
couplings has disengaged

14:50.390 --> 14:52.991
Because it's detecting
the possibility of a fatal over.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.359
Can you fix it?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.461
A real fix would take
a week in dry-dock,

14:56.463 --> 15:00.331
But we can make it work
like we did before.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.268
Only thing is,
someone has to go outside.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.937
Oh, that's rich.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.272
I'm not lying.

15:07.274 --> 15:10.675
Last time we
sent the android.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.413
I'll do it.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.483
Just tell me what
i need to know.

15:21.488 --> 15:25.623
[three snapping fingers]
snap, snap, snap

15:25.625 --> 15:29.494
Seriously, how can he be
sleeping at a time like this?

15:29.496 --> 15:30.561
Hey.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.230
He's conserving oxygen.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.498
You should be happy.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.267
There's only
so much in here.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.572
There's nothing we can
be doing right now anyways.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.442
To him, it's an
efficient use of time.

15:44.444 --> 15:48.613
Sure, if you're a robot.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.282
He feels things
same as you.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.685
He just doesn't show it.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.993
What happened to two
hit you pretty hard huh?

16:01.995 --> 16:04.595
Just caught
me off guard is all.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.597
I didn't think
they'd really do it.

16:06.599 --> 16:10.601
We all know there was
something between you two.

16:10.603 --> 16:13.738
It's a small ship.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.174
It was only once.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.544
Didn't mean a thing.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.312
Uh huh.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.654
Before we went
into those pods,

16:29.656 --> 16:32.590
There must have been times
when we lost people right?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.292
Most likely.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.194
That's the life.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.263
And if you believe half of
what people say about us,

16:39.265 --> 16:42.266
I'm guessing that we
never let it slow us down.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.668
Ever.

16:46.773 --> 16:54.312
Maybe we really are
different this time around.

16:54.314 --> 16:58.683
That's what she
was hoping for.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.525
[four]
you okay?

17:08.661 --> 17:11.195
Where's five?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.768
This button right here
activates your mag boots.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.302
The coupling is
located in a trench

17:18.304 --> 17:20.138
About 50 meters
from the airlock.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.039
You good?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.108
Yeah.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.176
Alright we're gonna monitor
your progress from the bridge.

17:25.178 --> 17:27.445
You got this.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.495
I hate kids.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.265
Ah, you can kill her
when we're done here.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.274
Alright, your
good to go.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.511
Okay, de-pressurizing.

18:11.357 --> 18:15.193
De-pressurization
complete.

18:15.195 --> 18:20.331
Activating mag
boots.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.238
And i'm opening
the outer door.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.186
Alright, i'm outside.

18:42.188 --> 18:47.758
(beeping)

18:47.760 --> 18:50.862
You know,
i got to say--

18:50.864 --> 18:52.363
It's pretty
beautiful out here.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.365
You can write a
poem about it later.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.233
Get the job done.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.401
Understood.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.904
I can see the trench
where the coupling's housed.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.773
It's directly
ahead of me.

19:02.775 --> 19:05.276
What the hell?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.244
(beeping)

19:06.246 --> 19:08.913
I'm losing air pressure!

19:08.915 --> 19:10.882
What are you talking about?

19:10.884 --> 19:13.251
(gasping for air)

19:13.253 --> 19:14.852
My mag boots are deactivated!

19:14.854 --> 19:17.788
Can you identity
where the breach is?

19:17.790 --> 19:21.292
(gasping for air)

19:21.294 --> 19:22.326
He's off the ship!

19:22.328 --> 19:24.262
Vons, do you read me?

19:24.264 --> 19:25.429
Vons!

19:25.431 --> 19:33.804
(intercom static)

19:33.806 --> 19:35.406
Do something!

19:40.780 --> 19:42.380
It's too late.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.620
What the hell
just happened?!

19:49.622 --> 19:50.855
I don't know.

19:50.857 --> 19:56.394
(beeping)

19:56.396 --> 19:57.395
That's impossible.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.396
What?

19:58.398 --> 19:59.681
Someone's pressurizing the airl.

19:59.682 --> 20:00.965
Are you sure
the prisoners are secure?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.200
Yes positive.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.434
I've got the door
monitored from here.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.735
It's been locked the whole time.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.437
Who else is on this ship?

20:06.439 --> 20:07.522
No one.

20:07.523 --> 20:08.606
You're lying.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.491
Take her and put
her with the others.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.660
Get down there
and check the airlock.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.529
Now!

20:40.340 --> 20:41.672
That's far enough.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.936
You sent vons out there.

21:11.938 --> 21:12.987
He volunteered.

21:12.988 --> 21:14.037
I was just
trying to help.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.539
The whole thing
was your idea.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.774
What did you do?

21:16.776 --> 21:17.942
What happened
to him?!

21:17.944 --> 21:18.843
I don't know.

21:18.844 --> 21:19.743
I didn't do anything.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.812
Lying little bitch.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.419
You're supposed
to be dead.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.388
Yeah, sorry to
disappoint.

21:30.390 --> 21:38.062
[grunting and panting]

22:15.702 --> 22:17.635
I thought
you were gone.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.804
Yeah yeah, so did
i.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.405
What happened?

22:21.407 --> 22:24.342
When i figure it out,
i'll tell you.

22:24.344 --> 22:25.509
Where are the others?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.411
They're still in the vault.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.348
Wexler's on the bridge and
cain went down to the airlock.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.616
Good, let's go, come on.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.928
You guys
hear something?

22:56.509 --> 22:57.708
(banging on door)

22:57.710 --> 22:58.909
[five]
guys!

22:58.911 --> 23:03.481
(banging on door)

23:03.483 --> 23:04.915
Door's too thick.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.418
How much air do you
think they have left?

23:07.420 --> 23:07.985
I don't know.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.987
Not much.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.856
They changed the code.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.658
I'll get that code from
wexler one way or another.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.561
In the meantime, i want
you to get into the vents,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.830
You find a safe hiding
place and stay there.

23:19.832 --> 23:23.768
It's not a discussion, now go.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.689
[cain] wexler, you ain't
gonna believe this.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.174
Tash is dead.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.658
[wexler]what the hell
are you talking about?

23:48.661 --> 23:51.429
Are you telling me that
little girl managed to kill her?

23:51.431 --> 23:54.432
I don't know what happened,
but she ain't just taking a nap.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.700
You find that little bitch,
and when you do,

23:56.702 --> 23:57.768
You don't stop to chat,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.770
You just put one
right in her brain.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.771
Do you understand me?

24:00.773 --> 24:02.640
[cain]
roger that.

24:10.049 --> 24:19.557
(ringing)

24:19.559 --> 24:21.692
This is the vrc dimitriev.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.662
We have a shuttle
inbound off your port side.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.631
Do you have the device?

24:27.633 --> 24:29.133
Yeah, we got it.

24:29.135 --> 24:32.870
Ah we just got a little
bit of a situation here.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.850
Two teams, fan out.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.743
[one coughing]

25:15.615 --> 25:19.917
Is anyone else getting
a little light-headed?

25:19.919 --> 25:24.054
[six]
the air is getting thin.

25:24.056 --> 25:28.526
[one] we've got to make a plan,
while we can still think straig.

25:30.863 --> 25:35.699
Hey, don't everybody talk at on.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.536
We're supposed to be
good at this sort of thing.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.005
Some of us are, anyway.

25:41.007 --> 25:41.939
Hey!

25:41.941 --> 25:43.407
Huh.

25:43.408 --> 25:44.874
I'm in this as
much as you are.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.144
Not really.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.779
What is that
supposed to mean?

25:48.781 --> 25:53.918
If they turn us in, sooner
or later the authorities

25:53.920 --> 25:58.289
Will realize you're not
the real jace corso,

25:58.291 --> 26:02.159
And when they do,
they'll release you.

26:02.161 --> 26:05.062
He's got a point.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.832
We've got nothing to lose,
but you sure as hell do.

26:08.834 --> 26:11.602
So when we
make our move,

26:11.604 --> 26:16.640
You should just get
down and stay down.

26:16.642 --> 26:20.077
You really
think i'd do that?

26:20.079 --> 26:24.181
We're past the point of
every man for himself.

26:24.183 --> 26:30.254
If we're gonna go down fighting,
we're gonna do it together.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.303
Look, i know we've
had our differences.

26:46.305 --> 26:50.841
Some of us more than others,
but that's not important now.

26:50.843 --> 26:57.281
The android's down...

26:57.283 --> 26:59.350
Two's dead...

27:06.125 --> 27:10.961
...And they've got five.

27:10.963 --> 27:16.200
She's out there all
by herself, helpless.

27:37.757 --> 27:41.392
It's up to us.

27:41.394 --> 27:44.862
Nobody's gonna
do this for us.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.797
We have to
do it ourselves.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.403
(gunshots)
bang, bang, bang

28:01.847 --> 28:04.848
When they come through that
door i say we take 'em down

28:04.850 --> 28:07.918
And we take
'em down hard.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.789
And we show them what the
men of the raza are made of.

28:12.124 --> 28:22.466
[grunting and panting]

28:24.437 --> 28:27.438
[rapid gunfire]
bang, bang, bang

28:27.440 --> 28:29.373
[knife slices throat]

28:32.445 --> 28:35.112
We may not have
been able to help two.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.448
But we can make
the bastards pay.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.783
Damn straight!

28:39.785 --> 28:41.185
Nope.

28:43.389 --> 28:48.025
Ah, take it easy.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.467
Why don't you come
have a seat for a minute.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.442
Yeah maybe
just for a minute.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.845
Good speech, though.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.881
Even if it was mostly
the hypoxia talking.

29:10.883 --> 29:21.925
(laughing)

29:21.927 --> 29:23.377
I heard gunfire.

29:23.378 --> 29:24.828
What the hell's
going on down there?

29:24.830 --> 29:25.863
We've got men down.

29:25.865 --> 29:26.430
We're in pursuit.

29:26.432 --> 29:27.931
Son-of-a-bitch.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.829
Hey, hey.

30:02.201 --> 30:06.904
You need to know i understand.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.442
I appreciate that.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.416
What?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.952
What are we talking about?

30:21.954 --> 30:23.487
[three]
revenge.

30:23.489 --> 30:27.424
Revenge, for what they did to t.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.929
You want revenge.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.514
So do i.

30:33.515 --> 30:35.098
Turns out that we're
not that different after all.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.967
I don't know.

30:36.969 --> 30:42.439
You know, i used to think that
you didn't have it in you man,

30:42.441 --> 30:45.175
But no, that's not it.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.978
It's that you've never
been in the position

30:47.980 --> 30:51.181
Where you hate
someone so much

30:51.183 --> 30:56.386
That you just
wanna kill them.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.455
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.995
Huh.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.884
[cain]
that's far enough.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.486
Drop your weapon.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.122
I said, drop
your weapon!

31:48.073 --> 31:51.475
I have never seen anyone
survive being spaced before.

31:51.477 --> 31:56.647
That is quite a trick.

31:56.649 --> 32:01.018
Think you could survive
a bullet between the eyes?

32:01.020 --> 32:05.055
I say we try it,
and find out.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.660
[cain]
this is for vons and tash.

32:09.662 --> 32:16.099
(gun shots)

32:19.204 --> 32:26.009
[five panting]

32:26.011 --> 32:27.244
Are you alright?

32:27.246 --> 32:28.412
I'm fine. Are you?

32:28.414 --> 32:30.214
Yeah.

32:30.215 --> 32:32.015
I'm sorry, i know i'm supposed
to be hiding right now.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.953
I'm not gonna complain.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.956
Let's go.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.024
[wexler]
cain come in.

32:41.026 --> 32:43.593
Cain, goddamnit
were the hell are you?

32:43.595 --> 32:44.962
Sergeant, report!

32:44.964 --> 32:45.729
Anybody!

32:45.731 --> 32:47.498
This is the dimitriev.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.266
Wexler, what the hell is
happening on that ship?

32:49.268 --> 32:50.600
Why aren't my
men responding?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.052
I don't know.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.503
I think some of
them might be down.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.272
Is this some kind
of double cross?

32:55.274 --> 32:58.375
No, no, it's um, we're
just having a little issue

32:58.377 --> 33:00.510
With the crew of
the raza that's all.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.512
You were supposed
to have them locked down.

33:02.514 --> 33:04.097
I know.

33:04.098 --> 33:05.681
Don't worry. I can handle it.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.751
[two]
you sure about that?

33:10.689 --> 33:14.157
No, that's impossible,
i killed you.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.760
You screwed that up,
like everything else.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.328
[dimitriev]
wexler, what's going on?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.013
Who is that?

33:20.014 --> 33:21.697
This is portia lin,
commander of the raza.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.133
We've re-taken the ship.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.735
If you want that device,

33:24.737 --> 33:28.005
You're gonna have to
go through us to get it.

33:28.007 --> 33:31.174
What's it gonna be?

33:31.176 --> 33:37.047
(beeping)

33:37.049 --> 33:39.182
Guess they weren't
looking for a fight.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.352
They just jumped to ftl.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.054
Shit.

33:44.056 --> 33:50.193
Well now, we're all alone.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.531
You're gonna let me go.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.133
Am i?

33:56.135 --> 33:57.567
Yeah, that's right.

33:57.569 --> 34:00.137
You're gonna fly me to
the nearest space station,

34:00.139 --> 34:01.805
And then when i'm
safely off the ship

34:01.807 --> 34:04.241
I'll radio back
with the code.

34:04.243 --> 34:10.747
Otherwise you'll just be
letting them all suffocate.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.682
I've got a better idea.

34:18.724 --> 34:22.426
It seems like we've
come full circle, doesn't it?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.561
You can
threaten me all you like

34:24.563 --> 34:27.264
But we both know
you can't kill me.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.599
Without the code
your friends are dead.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.302
You're forgetting you're
not the only one on this ship

34:32.304 --> 34:35.539
That knows how to open doors.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.842
Oh, the little girl?

34:38.844 --> 34:42.579
You must be kidding.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.714
She's my insurance policy.

34:44.716 --> 34:48.151
In case you decide to be diffic.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.726
She'll never
crack that vault.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.795
You sure you want
to take that chance?

35:02.167 --> 35:06.736
Because if she opens that door
before you give me the code,

35:06.738 --> 35:12.209
You will regret it.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.479
I do not have to
kill you quickly.

35:22.221 --> 35:25.489
If i give you the code you're
just gonna blow me out anyway.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.491
Why?

35:27.492 --> 35:29.492
Because that's
what you did to me?

35:29.495 --> 35:32.429
I'm nothing like you, wexler.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.831
If you give me the code,
i will let you out.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.375
Okay.

35:45.377 --> 35:50.180
It's 1040-99xd-4.

35:50.182 --> 35:53.783
It was my serial
number in prison.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.719
You copy that?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.823
Got it.

36:01.927 --> 36:05.228
We're ready.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.863
Where are they?

36:06.865 --> 36:10.634
It's okay,
we took care of them.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.735
It's over.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.271
Who's we?

36:14.273 --> 36:16.490
I got the door open.

36:16.491 --> 36:18.708
They're all pretty woozy,
but i think they're going to be.

36:18.710 --> 36:22.812
Who you talking to?

36:22.814 --> 36:24.314
Okay, i did my part.

36:24.316 --> 36:29.920
Now it's your turn.

36:29.922 --> 36:35.692
Hey, you said you were
gonna let me out.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.527
Hey, quit screwing around.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.329
Alright, you're not
a cold blooded killer.

36:39.331 --> 36:44.334
You're not like me, remember?

36:44.336 --> 36:47.270
After today,
i don't know what i am.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.747
When does this
headache go away?

36:57.749 --> 37:01.351
Could be a while.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.787
What about two?

37:03.789 --> 37:06.256
I didn't hallucinate that, did ?

37:06.258 --> 37:08.358
She got blown out the airlock.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.227
Yeah.

37:10.229 --> 37:14.598
She said she was pushed out
toward the front of the ship,

37:14.600 --> 37:17.801
But she managed to grab onto
a raised section of the hull.

37:17.803 --> 37:27.344
She held on,
waiting to die, and she didn't.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.613
She pulled herself down
into one of the trenches

37:29.615 --> 37:31.815
That house
the forward couplings,

37:31.817 --> 37:35.285
Disengaged one of them
so that ship wouldn't jump.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.587
Then she pushed herself
toward the airlock,

37:37.589 --> 37:41.992
And waited for them
to open the door.

37:41.994 --> 37:45.362
All that, without a space suit?

37:45.364 --> 37:48.898
Apparently.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.967
What the hell is she?

37:57.909 --> 38:03.313
[android] as far as i can tell,
you're an advanced bio-syntheti.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.515
[two]
what does that mean?

38:05.517 --> 38:11.655
You weren't born,
you were engineered.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.323
What, like you?

38:13.325 --> 38:15.792
No, not like me.

38:15.794 --> 38:19.929
You have a heart,
lungs, kidneys, fluids.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.465
But your constituent
parts were manufactured,

38:22.467 --> 38:24.834
To exact specifications,
and then assembled.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.836
You also have a network
of corrector nanites

38:26.838 --> 38:30.974
Moving throughout your body,
even more advanced than my own.

38:30.976 --> 38:34.711
They're designed to migrate
quickly to any area of need.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.346
Like when i was bitten.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.347
It killed the virus.

38:37.349 --> 38:38.615
Correct.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.317
And healed the wound itself.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.353
I believe that when you were
exposed to the cold of space,

38:43.355 --> 38:45.422
The nanites migrated to your sk,

38:45.424 --> 38:49.459
Joined together and formed
a protective shield.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.961
It couldn't have been more
than a few microns thick,

38:51.963 --> 38:53.830
But it kept you alive.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.434
Very impressive.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.869
You knew.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.072
I had my suspicions.

39:02.074 --> 39:04.074
Why didn't you say anything.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.009
You didn't ask.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.448
I had no idea this
technology even existed.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.583
It doesn't, officially.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.353
And it's in contravention
of all g.A. Regulations

39:16.355 --> 39:19.723
Regarding the manufacture
of artificial persons.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.525
If the authorities were
to learn of your existence,

39:22.527 --> 39:31.067
It is likely you would be
hunted down and destroyed.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.377
So what do we do
with this thing now?

39:40.379 --> 39:44.080
Complete the delivery,
get paid, what else?

39:44.082 --> 39:46.716
I don't think we
should deliver this guys.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.702
Whatever this thing is,

39:48.703 --> 39:50.687
Three corporations
were willing to kill for it.

39:50.689 --> 39:52.722
I'm thinking it's something
that's extremely dangerous.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.158
All the more reason
to get it off the ship.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.494
Yeah.

39:57.496 --> 40:02.465
Maybe we should ask
two what she thinks.

40:02.467 --> 40:07.070
What, we're not
gonna trust her now?

40:07.072 --> 40:10.140
Because she's not who
we thought she was?

40:16.448 --> 40:19.416
Welcome to
the goddamn club.

40:39.204 --> 40:44.607
The device is online,
activating field, ten percent.

40:55.987 --> 40:58.221
Pleasure doing business with yo.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.857
Likewise.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.568
[android]
this is interesting.

41:11.570 --> 41:13.036
We're getting
some unusual readings

41:13.038 --> 41:15.104
From the planet's surface.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.244
What the hell was that?

41:21.246 --> 41:22.946
The field's become unstable.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.848
Shut it down.

41:24.850 --> 41:27.183
Oh my god.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.490
[android] the planet's
gravitational field is fluctuat.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.893
We need to leave, immediately.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.728
[two]
marauder, what's your position?

41:38.730 --> 41:40.797
[six]
we're just docking now.

41:45.604 --> 41:47.587
Can we jump?

41:47.588 --> 41:49.571
The field variance is making
nav calculations impossible.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.641
Maximum sublight, now!

41:57.516 --> 42:01.217
The planet is breaking up.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.287
Divert all available
power to the engines!

42:08.527 --> 42:11.027
What the hell's going on?

42:11.029 --> 42:13.196
Let's go.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.277
We're clear of the field.

42:27.279 --> 42:30.113
I'm dialing back the engines.

42:34.586 --> 42:37.654
The planet has been destroyed.
