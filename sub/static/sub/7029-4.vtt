WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:02.730
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island isn't

00:02.730 --> 00:05.960
that a Templar cross this cross is

00:05.960 --> 00:08.420
Portuguese I do have evidence that puts

00:08.420 --> 00:11.869
them at this location from 1500 to 1580

00:11.869 --> 00:13.320
we want to get to the bottom of 10x

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
right now

00:14.320 --> 00:19.720
this is not a routine dive

00:25.620 --> 00:30.860
there's a wall here

00:31.160 --> 00:34.620
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.620 --> 00:36.250
where people have been looking for an

00:36.250 --> 00:39.530
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.530 --> 00:43.130
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.130 --> 00:46.660
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.660 --> 00:50.090
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.090 --> 00:54.080
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.080 --> 00:57.440
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:57.440 --> 01:01.410
and according to legend

01:01.410 --> 01:06.000
one more, have to die 
before the treasure can be found

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:24.000 --> 01:31.369
looks like it's right here

01:31.369 --> 01:35.649
there's a beam is that a wall that could

01:35.649 --> 01:36.700
be the wall yeah

01:36.700 --> 01:41.029
yep I think we found it brothers Rick

01:41.029 --> 01:43.909
and Marty lagina may be on the verge of

01:43.909 --> 01:46.020
one of the most important breakthroughs

01:46.020 --> 01:48.950
in the 220 year old oak island mystery

01:48.950 --> 01:51.979
while digging in the area where the

01:51.979 --> 01:54.279
original money pit was discovered in

01:54.279 --> 01:58.279
1795 they have just uncovered a section

01:58.279 --> 02:01.869
of wall they believe is part of a 78

02:01.869 --> 02:03.459
year old searcher tunnel called the

02:03.459 --> 02:07.189
heavy shaft

02:07.189 --> 02:09.910
constructed in 1937 by treasure hunter

02:09.910 --> 02:13.560
Gilbert Hedden the 12 by 24 foot shaft

02:13.560 --> 02:17.500
with 125 feet deep underground and was

02:17.500 --> 02:19.110
believed to have intersected the

02:19.110 --> 02:22.140
original money pit

02:22.140 --> 02:24.250
finding the Hedden shaft could be the

02:24.250 --> 02:27.280
key to determining the exact location of

02:27.280 --> 02:30.910
the long-lost treasure site when Gilbert

02:30.910 --> 02:32.750
Hedden dug that shaft he thought he was

02:32.750 --> 02:34.600
digging in the money pit and he was that

02:34.600 --> 02:37.510
much closer to history than we are so we

02:37.510 --> 02:40.040
thought that by locating that accurately

02:40.040 --> 02:42.270
digging down and finding the corners

02:42.270 --> 02:44.720
it's another clue to pin down the money

02:44.720 --> 02:45.720
pit

02:45.720 --> 02:49.910
so yes it's gonna take a lot of bull

02:49.910 --> 02:51.600
drop the bucket right here I'm standing

02:51.600 --> 02:53.270
right here I'm gonna put it right on it

02:53.270 --> 02:56.300
and then you just pull right there okay

02:56.300 --> 02:58.190
but I have to stand here all right just

02:58.190 --> 02:59.230
move back a bit please

02:59.230 --> 03:03.190
I'm like a surgeon with this thing yeah

03:03.190 --> 03:05.590
the surgeon was a bit of a stretch yes

03:05.590 --> 03:07.640
searching that's not I'd still trusted

03:07.640 --> 03:11.040
it put that with your head down I'll

03:11.040 --> 03:12.390
flip it right on your head for you

03:12.390 --> 03:18.190
I trust you in a lot of ways but not

03:18.190 --> 03:21.269
that one

03:21.269 --> 03:22.900
I was comfortable being in the hall when

03:22.900 --> 03:25.070
he was operating I knew look we had the

03:25.070 --> 03:27.400
same goal and I never worried not even

03:27.400 --> 03:28.400
one single time

03:28.400 --> 03:34.700
I don't like swinging this over your

03:34.700 --> 03:36.520
head slow

03:36.520 --> 03:39.310
Rick was perfectly calm he trusts me to

03:39.310 --> 03:41.970
not hit him with that bucket forget hit

03:41.970 --> 03:43.540
if you just touched somebody with that

03:43.540 --> 03:45.340
thing have probably waited for tons or

03:45.340 --> 03:48.210
something so that was trying to be very

03:48.210 --> 03:49.210
careful

04:02.810 --> 04:07.270
damn wrong

04:13.270 --> 04:16.041
you think that is the wall Dan yeah that

04:16.041 --> 04:18.180
looks like good wall down below there

04:18.180 --> 04:19.829
comes on take a look for yourself you

04:19.829 --> 04:22.048
know I was hoping you'd say anything but

04:22.048 --> 04:23.049
that

04:23.049 --> 04:25.990
finding a section of a wooden wall

04:25.990 --> 04:29.229
offers proof that Rick Marty and Dan

04:29.229 --> 04:32.639
have found the hidden shaft that Rick is

04:32.639 --> 04:36.639
amazing you know that is solid we have

04:36.639 --> 04:39.699
found it that is clearly the exterior

04:39.699 --> 04:43.879
wall of the old head and chef uncovering

04:43.879 --> 04:47.370
the head and shaft is a major discovery

04:47.370 --> 04:49.840
finding it will now allow Rick and Marty

04:49.840 --> 04:52.400
to pinpoint the exact location of the

04:52.400 --> 04:54.530
original money pit it's a lot different

04:54.530 --> 04:56.840
than we thought we thought it went off

04:56.840 --> 04:59.020
that way but first they will need to

04:59.020 --> 05:01.050
determine now which wall of the head and

05:01.050 --> 05:04.110
shaft they found and where its corners

05:04.110 --> 05:07.629
lie we at least have a bearing we don't

05:07.629 --> 05:09.569
have a distance yet cuz they're not sure

05:09.569 --> 05:12.080
the corner so when we find that corner

05:12.080 --> 05:15.660
mm-hmm keep digging

05:15.660 --> 05:19.009
I was astounded because we're gonna know

05:19.009 --> 05:21.180
better than anyone on earth where the

05:21.180 --> 05:23.550
original money pit was well that's a big

05:23.550 --> 05:26.680
deal Marik I'm wondering if it's right

05:26.680 --> 05:31.110
under this stuff right under your foot I

05:31.110 --> 05:34.650
think it's right here well actually it

05:34.650 --> 05:39.639
could be that's a piece of wood you're

05:39.639 --> 05:45.779
splintering it it seems to be at a right

05:45.779 --> 05:47.599
angle that's the right distance to be

05:47.599 --> 05:51.930
the other wall yeah that piece looks

05:51.930 --> 05:53.080
like pulled right out of there that's

05:53.080 --> 05:54.900
the look at that that's the piece that

05:54.900 --> 05:58.460
pulled out of there that's the corner

05:58.460 --> 06:01.410
yeah tricky it was buried right in there

06:01.410 --> 06:04.509
at a perfect right angle correct that's

06:04.509 --> 06:08.949
the corner for sure we found the corners

06:08.949 --> 06:11.909
of the head and shaft thus we can orient

06:11.909 --> 06:14.059
it off them and thus we know roughly

06:14.059 --> 06:17.349
where the money pit should be well look

06:17.349 --> 06:19.939
we have one wall firmly established we

06:19.939 --> 06:22.360
have the orientation firmly established

06:22.360 --> 06:23.490
we've learned something because we

06:23.490 --> 06:24.969
thought it went that way and it really

06:24.969 --> 06:27.780
goes that way after digging for the

06:27.780 --> 06:30.740
better part of a day Rick Marty and

06:30.740 --> 06:32.550
their partners have excavated

06:32.550 --> 06:35.740
approximately half of the 24 by 12 foot

06:35.740 --> 06:38.831
head and shaft as a team I think we did

06:38.831 --> 06:41.500
some nice work and we have accurately

06:41.500 --> 06:43.360
located the head chef that is an

06:43.360 --> 06:45.349
accomplishment okay well let's call it a

06:45.349 --> 06:48.580
day let's declare victory partial

06:48.580 --> 06:58.460
victory tonight crown time yeah

06:58.460 --> 07:01.349
after a successful day of searching Rick

07:01.349 --> 07:04.719
Marty dave blankenship Craig tester and

07:04.719 --> 07:07.150
his stepson Jack Begley gather to

07:07.150 --> 07:10.389
celebrate at a nearby pop so it wasn't a

07:10.389 --> 07:12.240
bad day today because I think I

07:12.240 --> 07:13.919
performed admirably on that excavator

07:13.919 --> 07:20.559
what do you think kill me well are we

07:20.559 --> 07:21.680
gonna keep digging

07:21.680 --> 07:25.330
No why not I think there are several

07:25.330 --> 07:26.849
reasons Jack I mean first of all our

07:26.849 --> 07:29.710
intent was to just locate it so that we

07:29.710 --> 07:31.509
could then use it to locate the money

07:31.509 --> 07:33.960
pit okay that'd be one to visit

07:33.960 --> 07:37.159
dangerous damn dangerous we don't know

07:37.159 --> 07:39.279
how it was filled the soils are so

07:39.279 --> 07:44.930
inconsolable 50 feet of open hold on

07:44.930 --> 07:47.730
they're just sand is bridged above it I

07:47.730 --> 07:49.360
mean I was a little bit on pins and

07:49.360 --> 07:50.800
needles all the time he's in there I've

07:50.800 --> 07:52.069
waiting for him to kind of disappear you

07:52.069 --> 07:54.860
know whoosh and we have the limit of the

07:54.860 --> 07:57.349
equipment we have their two-year-olds 22

07:57.349 --> 07:59.159
foot boom we don't bring in different

07:59.159 --> 08:01.669
equipment Marty's decision to stop

08:01.669 --> 08:03.830
digging at the money pit is a strategic

08:03.830 --> 08:06.689
one rather than face bloodied or a

08:06.689 --> 08:08.960
dangerous cave entry he and his brother

08:08.960 --> 08:11.210
have decided to wait until they can get

08:11.210 --> 08:13.939
scanning sonar into the hole that Craig

08:13.939 --> 08:15.360
tester drilled last summer

08:15.360 --> 08:18.940
the same hall where they found evidence

08:18.940 --> 08:21.229
of a large wooden vault that was first

08:21.229 --> 08:23.210
discovered by treasure hunter Frederick

08:23.210 --> 08:25.189
Blair and drill operator William

08:25.189 --> 08:29.939
Chappell back in 1897 definitely got

08:29.939 --> 08:32.909
wood that's definitely cement concrete

08:32.909 --> 08:36.900
and then wood that's the description

08:36.900 --> 08:38.770
that's what they found in the top of the

08:38.770 --> 08:41.140
vault what we're really after is

08:41.140 --> 08:44.070
verifying what Craig found with borehole

08:44.070 --> 08:46.150
valley 3 whether that's in the money pit

08:46.150 --> 08:48.330
or not and I would say that you know

08:48.330 --> 08:50.410
I'll quote the 8-ball signs point to yes

08:50.410 --> 08:53.260
because that head and shaft at least

08:53.260 --> 08:55.840
according to the Roper survey would

08:55.840 --> 08:57.950
indicate that you drilled right on the

08:57.950 --> 08:59.820
edge of the muddy pit which is exactly

08:59.820 --> 09:02.200
what the bit said right so we're pretty

09:02.200 --> 09:05.810
hopeful it's showing that the vault

09:05.810 --> 09:08.910
Craig hit is probably the ball I think

09:08.910 --> 09:09.980
that's a fair statement yeah

09:09.980 --> 09:12.960
can't be done well is that the depth and

09:12.960 --> 09:14.930
now we know it's the same fish in the

09:14.930 --> 09:17.050
right spot yep well we had a good day

09:17.050 --> 09:19.450
gentlemen got the head and shaft that'll

09:19.450 --> 09:21.760
help us in our exploration in the money

09:21.760 --> 09:24.310
pit so it was a good day we call it a

09:24.310 --> 09:25.310
success

09:25.310 --> 09:36.030
it'll be neat this actually see the

09:36.030 --> 09:38.370
Overton stone we're gonna make it reveal

09:38.370 --> 09:40.890
its secrets well I think it's a far

09:40.890 --> 09:43.820
fetch but we'll see what happens

09:43.820 --> 09:45.840
one day after locating both the head and

09:45.840 --> 09:48.740
shaft and the money pit brothers Rick

09:48.740 --> 09:51.200
and Marty lagina their partner Craig

09:51.200 --> 09:53.820
tester and veteran treasure hunter Dave

09:53.820 --> 09:56.350
Blankenship are traveling to the small

09:56.350 --> 10:00.960
seaside town of Overton Nova Scotia

10:00.960 --> 10:02.950
there they plan to meet with local

10:02.950 --> 10:06.160
historian Terry Duvall and investigate

10:06.160 --> 10:08.260
the stone carving that Oak Island

10:08.260 --> 10:11.010
researcher Robert Markus believes was

10:11.010 --> 10:14.770
pointed to in an antique treasure map

10:14.770 --> 10:17.350
this is the starting point okay this is

10:17.350 --> 10:19.620
called the boat stone a stone that was

10:19.620 --> 10:22.740
found in Westford Massachusetts the boat

10:22.740 --> 10:26.540
represents a coastal range followed the

10:26.540 --> 10:30.510
coast the number 184 the unit of measure

10:30.510 --> 10:34.770
back then was called a lead now 184

10:34.770 --> 10:38.130
leagues north takes you to Overton Nova

10:38.130 --> 10:40.130
Scotia

10:40.130 --> 10:42.400
when you get to there you find the stone

10:42.400 --> 10:46.300
within the stone right here you have a

10:46.300 --> 10:48.350
depiction of the circle with the

10:48.350 --> 10:50.850
Templars cross in it

10:50.850 --> 10:55.990
now David if he connects your Templars

10:55.990 --> 10:58.570
with Oak Island you'd be quite pleased

10:58.570 --> 11:00.350
about that right yep

11:00.350 --> 11:09.640
an open mind that's all I'm here

11:09.640 --> 11:12.430
yes

11:12.430 --> 11:20.940
just a guy we're supposed to meet let's

11:20.940 --> 11:23.430
go hello Terry yeah Terry Deveau

11:23.430 --> 11:27.440
breakfast - Terry Deveau is a historian

11:27.440 --> 11:29.140
and researcher who has studied

11:29.140 --> 11:31.590
petroglyphs rock carvings and stone

11:31.590 --> 11:33.991
structures throughout Canada and the

11:33.991 --> 11:37.100
United States he is also president of

11:37.100 --> 11:39.030
the New England Antiquities Research

11:39.030 --> 11:41.920
Association so is it this way pretty

11:41.920 --> 11:46.820
much okay okay let's go let's go

11:46.820 --> 11:49.090
Terry Devoe's research has led him to

11:49.090 --> 11:51.920
make an incredible connection between

11:51.920 --> 11:54.480
Nova Scotia's early history and Oak

11:54.480 --> 11:57.720
Island a connection that could offer a

11:57.720 --> 12:00.190
key piece of information in solving a

12:00.190 --> 12:03.510
centuries-old mystery the rock here is

12:03.510 --> 12:06.690
probably located on the highest point in

12:06.690 --> 12:08.000
quite a distance around

12:08.000 --> 12:12.130
so now you can see the carven quite

12:12.130 --> 12:14.350
clearly here it's it's very beautiful

12:14.350 --> 12:23.400
has four main elements across that's in

12:23.400 --> 12:28.260
a circle an eagle feather

12:28.260 --> 12:30.070
these two things behind the eagle

12:30.070 --> 12:31.450
feathers that I interpret us tobacco

12:31.450 --> 12:36.160
leaves and a moon crescent moon that is

12:36.160 --> 12:37.540
quite remarkable

12:37.540 --> 12:41.110
and isn't that a Templar cross a Templar

12:41.110 --> 12:45.170
cross could the carving Terry Deveau has

12:45.170 --> 12:48.230
brought the team out to see really be

12:48.230 --> 12:49.340
hundreds of years old

12:49.340 --> 12:54.170
we'll talk about that in a few minutes

12:54.170 --> 12:57.940
but what I want to highlight is the fact

12:57.940 --> 12:59.340
that there is a controversy as to

12:59.340 --> 13:02.870
whether or not this is an old carving or

13:02.870 --> 13:04.630
a recent carving right right that's

13:04.630 --> 13:07.220
always that's always the issue and the

13:07.220 --> 13:09.290
problem with saying that this is an old

13:09.290 --> 13:13.180
carving is that it looks fairly fresh

13:13.180 --> 13:14.570
that could be deceptive in this case

13:14.570 --> 13:17.140
because this is a type of rock

13:17.140 --> 13:20.030
geologically that appears to weather

13:20.030 --> 13:22.630
very slowly because it was formed by

13:22.630 --> 13:25.850
volcanic ash that fell in layers and

13:25.850 --> 13:28.270
then got compacted and under the effect

13:28.270 --> 13:31.080
of pressure over time formed this type

13:31.080 --> 13:35.190
of rock and the patina which is the

13:35.190 --> 13:37.510
outer crust of the weathering is fairly

13:37.510 --> 13:40.560
thick right here but it's probably taken

13:40.560 --> 13:44.080
15,000 years to to develop okay so if

13:44.080 --> 13:46.820
you had to say most likely this old and

13:46.820 --> 13:48.710
most likely this sort of thing what

13:48.710 --> 13:50.930
would your answer be well I think it's

13:50.930 --> 13:53.760
clear that the carving is a genuine

13:53.760 --> 13:58.100
historical artifact and quite old

13:58.100 --> 14:01.080
possibly up to five hundred years old

14:01.080 --> 14:04.600
five hundred years old could this stone

14:04.600 --> 14:07.620
carving really date as far back as the

14:07.620 --> 14:10.180
1500s what about the circle and the four

14:10.180 --> 14:12.690
dots does that have any special meaning

14:12.690 --> 14:14.410
to it that is something I'd like to

14:14.410 --> 14:17.510
pursue so you have the cross with the

14:17.510 --> 14:20.220
circle that obviously is a Christian

14:20.220 --> 14:24.520
symbol right the eagle feather and

14:24.520 --> 14:26.132
behind the eagle feather there are a

14:26.132 --> 14:28.411
pair of tobacco leaves there you have

14:28.411 --> 14:33.240
two of the most important symbols in the

14:33.240 --> 14:35.940
mid ma belief system

14:35.940 --> 14:38.050
the hypothesis that I'm suggesting is

14:38.050 --> 14:40.630
that this whole carving was made by a

14:40.630 --> 14:43.780
European to commemorate perhaps a

14:43.780 --> 14:46.410
friendship treaty between Europeans and

14:46.410 --> 14:49.260
nigma

14:49.260 --> 14:51.820
so the question becomes which European

14:51.820 --> 14:57.010
group would be represented by this cross

14:57.010 --> 14:59.070
as the first known inhabitants of North

14:59.070 --> 15:01.540
America's northeastern region the

15:01.540 --> 15:03.470
Mi'kmaq people had their earliest

15:03.470 --> 15:06.260
recorded contact with Europeans as far

15:06.260 --> 15:10.040
back as the 15th century but there are

15:10.040 --> 15:12.820
many in the Mi'kmaq community who

15:12.820 --> 15:14.460
believed that that contact stretches

15:14.460 --> 15:17.920
back even earlier back as far as the

15:17.920 --> 15:21.590
1300s and the days of a Scottish Templar

15:21.590 --> 15:26.600
night by the name of Henry Sinclair

15:26.600 --> 15:28.530
could the Overtoun carbines be even

15:28.530 --> 15:30.940
older than Terry Deveau believes

15:30.940 --> 15:33.790
possibly dating this farm back is the

15:33.790 --> 15:37.930
14th century you know we're up to our

15:37.930 --> 15:39.930
eyeballs at all these various hypotheses

15:39.930 --> 15:42.590
right and what you just said if the

15:42.590 --> 15:44.190
timing were right would apply to this

15:44.190 --> 15:46.320
legendary Henry Sinclair voyage

15:46.320 --> 15:52.060
perfectly according to legend in 1398

15:52.060 --> 15:54.180
Prince Henry Sinclair sailed across the

15:54.180 --> 15:56.630
North Atlantic from Scotland to Oak

15:56.630 --> 15:59.860
Island nearly 100 years before Columbus

15:59.860 --> 16:03.990
there he is said to have buried a number

16:03.990 --> 16:06.230
of sacred religious treasures that had

16:06.230 --> 16:08.470
been rescued from the Holy Land during

16:08.470 --> 16:11.790
the Crusades among the items were the

16:11.790 --> 16:14.090
golden menorah of King Solomon's Temple

16:14.090 --> 16:18.250
the Ark of the Covenant and even the

16:18.250 --> 16:19.780
Holy Grail

16:19.780 --> 16:22.850
according to some accounts while in the

16:22.850 --> 16:25.160
new world Sinclair was worshipped as a

16:25.160 --> 16:27.860
God by the nygma people who knew him

16:27.860 --> 16:32.210
under the name clues cap in this

16:32.210 --> 16:35.010
particular case it does to me suggests

16:35.010 --> 16:39.230
that the economically legend I

16:39.230 --> 16:40.760
understand what you're saying from my

16:40.760 --> 16:44.870
point of view the question is what do

16:44.870 --> 16:47.760
you take as evidence and the way to

16:47.760 --> 16:50.630
interpret evidence is you try to let the

16:50.630 --> 16:52.960
evidence lead you right right so in the

16:52.960 --> 16:55.400
case of Sinclair I don't see that this

16:55.400 --> 16:57.740
is diagnostic of Sinclair right

16:57.740 --> 16:59.650
it may be compatible with Sinclair

16:59.650 --> 17:01.250
that's all that's all right but that's

17:01.250 --> 17:02.931
different than being diagnostic of it so

17:02.931 --> 17:08.160
from my mind this is diagnostic of

17:08.160 --> 17:16.050
Portuguese
from my mind this is

17:16.050 --> 17:18.880
diagnostic of Portuguese

17:18.880 --> 17:25.119
while examining a strange coffee in the

17:25.119 --> 17:29.240
seaside town of Overton Nova Scotia Rick

17:29.240 --> 17:31.300
Marty and their partners have just been

17:31.300 --> 17:35.470
treated to another incredible theory one

17:35.470 --> 17:37.890
that suggests that the origin of the Oak

17:37.890 --> 17:40.480
Island mystery might not be connected to

17:40.480 --> 17:42.550
the legend of Scottish Templar Henry

17:42.550 --> 17:45.800
Sinclair but to Portuguese explorers who

17:45.800 --> 17:47.140
visited the area

17:47.140 --> 17:51.070
in the 1500s

17:51.070 --> 17:53.840
interestingly this particular shape of

17:53.840 --> 17:57.070
cross is not all that common that we

17:57.070 --> 17:59.980
have the flaring outwards of the arms

17:59.980 --> 18:03.460
you mainly see it in Portuguese crosses

18:03.460 --> 18:08.460
it is widely believed that in addition

18:08.460 --> 18:10.710
to the Knights Templar that operated in

18:10.710 --> 18:13.100
England France and Scotland

18:13.100 --> 18:15.600
there was a Portuguese branch that was

18:15.600 --> 18:17.940
known under the name the Knights of

18:17.940 --> 18:22.110
Christ could it be that it was they and

18:22.110 --> 18:25.070
not Henry Sinclair who buried precious

18:25.070 --> 18:28.110
religious artifacts on Oak Island and

18:28.110 --> 18:30.720
then left behind various carvings as

18:30.720 --> 18:34.410
clues to where it could be found

18:34.410 --> 18:35.860
I do have evidence that puts the

18:35.860 --> 18:39.530
Portuguese in Nova Scotia between 1500

18:39.530 --> 18:41.670
and 1580 and you know they were here

18:41.670 --> 18:43.660
then however there are a few records

18:43.660 --> 18:48.580
that have survived in particular maps

18:48.580 --> 18:50.610
Portuguese were great cartographers and

18:50.610 --> 18:53.030
we've got a rich collection of maps

18:53.030 --> 18:54.970
where they named all kinds of different

18:54.970 --> 18:56.940
areas along the coast including this

18:56.940 --> 18:57.940
area as well

18:57.940 --> 19:01.640
although it is well known that

19:01.640 --> 19:03.640
Portuguese settlers established fishing

19:03.640 --> 19:06.190
outposts in Nova Scotia in the 16th

19:06.190 --> 19:09.140
century there is also compelling

19:09.140 --> 19:12.360
evidence that Portuguese explorer Vasco

19:12.360 --> 19:15.480
theory L found what he called the new

19:15.480 --> 19:18.140
land of the con fish in North America

19:18.140 --> 19:22.840
as far back as 1473 nearly 20 years

19:22.840 --> 19:25.330
before Christopher Columbus's Fame

19:25.330 --> 19:27.940
journey could there be additional

19:27.940 --> 19:30.290
evidence linking corte-real

19:30.290 --> 19:33.100
and the Knights of Christ and also a

19:33.100 --> 19:35.410
connection between his early journeys to

19:35.410 --> 19:40.220
North America and Oak Island

19:40.220 --> 19:42.800
this is very interesting yeah it is

19:42.800 --> 19:45.350
they're interesting how Terry analyzed

19:45.350 --> 19:47.630
it fits in with several theories I mean

19:47.630 --> 19:49.220
it really does it fits in with the

19:49.220 --> 19:51.540
Portuguese theory it fits in with

19:51.540 --> 19:54.130
Templar theory I mean really well

19:54.130 --> 19:56.270
he's a Templar cross the arms and stun

19:56.270 --> 19:58.730
were the same way they had both coins

19:58.730 --> 20:00.150
and they don't always flare out but

20:00.150 --> 20:02.210
sometimes they do but that would vary a

20:02.210 --> 20:03.640
lot I mean there were Templars in

20:03.640 --> 20:06.030
England Templars in Germany Templars in

20:06.030 --> 20:08.040
Portugal and Spain so they weren't all

20:08.040 --> 20:10.630
identical could Rick Marty and their

20:10.630 --> 20:13.660
partners have just seen evidence linking

20:13.660 --> 20:16.190
the Oak Island mystery to português

20:16.190 --> 20:18.840
treasure perhaps even treasure connected

20:18.840 --> 20:21.870
to the Knights Templar after Terry

20:21.870 --> 20:24.840
explained that this could be

20:24.840 --> 20:26.230
commemorating a meeting of cultures I

20:26.230 --> 20:28.559
said well why couldn't be Templars and

20:28.559 --> 20:30.460
the native peoples he just didn't think

20:30.460 --> 20:31.960
the carving was quite old enough for

20:31.960 --> 20:35.440
that but it sure looked like and I still

20:35.440 --> 20:38.660
think looks like a Templar cross we are

20:38.660 --> 20:40.420
very grateful for you taking the time to

20:40.420 --> 20:44.400
talk to us about it thank you as they

20:44.400 --> 20:47.059
walk away from the Overtoun stone the

20:47.059 --> 20:49.080
Oak Island team is more excited than

20:49.080 --> 20:51.590
ever to return to the island and resume

20:51.590 --> 20:54.540
their search finding the Hedden shaft

20:54.540 --> 20:56.800
has allowed them to verify the exact

20:56.800 --> 20:59.380
location of the money pit and seeing the

20:59.380 --> 21:01.580
stone carvings has offered physical

21:01.580 --> 21:04.110
evidence that the area was very likely

21:04.110 --> 21:07.190
visited by Europeans as far back as the

21:07.190 --> 21:08.190
16th century

21:08.190 --> 21:12.250
could getting to the bottom of 10-x and

21:12.250 --> 21:15.170
finding a shortcut into the money pit

21:15.170 --> 21:17.670
really be the final key they'll need to

21:17.670 --> 21:20.500
solve this 220 year old mystery

21:20.500 --> 21:39.870
here's the divers right here

21:39.870 --> 21:42.800
one day after his trip to Overton Rick

21:42.800 --> 21:44.980
lagina and the Oak Island team have

21:44.980 --> 21:47.920
arranged to meet with rob ritzy up RMI

21:47.920 --> 21:52.110
marine a commercial diving company that

21:52.110 --> 21:54.630
specializes in deep underwater surveying

21:54.630 --> 21:58.390
construction and salvage operations so

21:58.390 --> 21:59.640
guys this is the hole this is the

21:59.640 --> 22:03.340
project 10x today's agenda really is

22:03.340 --> 22:06.600
clear the floor hold the 27-inch there's

22:06.600 --> 22:08.670
a section of the 27-inch casing about

22:08.670 --> 22:11.340
six feet there David yeah and then we

22:11.340 --> 22:15.460
got one riser still at home

22:15.460 --> 22:18.200
yeah okay okay drop the sonar to the

22:18.200 --> 22:21.070
pipe earlier this year sonar scans

22:21.070 --> 22:24.340
conducted at the bottom of the 235-foot

22:24.340 --> 22:27.960
deep borehole known as 10x revealed the

22:27.960 --> 22:33.320
possibility of a large man-made chamber

22:33.320 --> 22:40.640
posts tunnels wooden chests and even

22:40.640 --> 22:44.480
human remains

22:44.480 --> 22:46.770
now that most of the riser pipes and

22:46.770 --> 22:49.010
other above water obstructions have been

22:49.010 --> 22:51.840
removed ritzy and his team have been

22:51.840 --> 22:53.890
hired to clear the corroded metal and

22:53.890 --> 22:59.580
debris from the 181 foot level of 10x

22:59.580 --> 23:01.760
once done the shaft should be safe

23:01.760 --> 23:04.440
enough for another dive team to come in

23:04.440 --> 23:07.010
and attempt an even deeper and more

23:07.010 --> 23:11.510
dangerous dive below the 181 foot level

23:11.510 --> 23:14.550
and through the 27-inch wide hole that

23:14.550 --> 23:17.390
leads 44 feet down to the mysterious

23:17.390 --> 23:20.420
underground chamber all right well let's

23:20.420 --> 23:24.690
get geared up to go diving today

23:24.690 --> 23:26.590
Jonathan Doyle's will be today's first

23:26.590 --> 23:31.130
diver

23:31.130 --> 23:33.450
he will be lowered into 10x by means of

23:33.450 --> 23:36.250
a dive cage that Robert C has had

23:36.250 --> 23:40.150
custom-made for today's operation good

23:40.150 --> 23:44.510
thing we made a built round just like

23:44.510 --> 23:47.110
10x it features a gate that will allow

23:47.110 --> 23:49.500
the divers to get in and out of the cage

23:49.500 --> 23:52.410
quickly without having to climb up and

23:52.410 --> 24:00.910
over the sides okay but squinch over

24:00.910 --> 24:02.330
just keep them from spinning anymore

24:02.330 --> 24:06.560
Nick well it's not just myself I think

24:06.560 --> 24:08.450
we're all anticipating this this is what

24:08.450 --> 24:10.090
we're focused on this year we want to

24:10.090 --> 24:13.770
get to the bottom of 10x and this is the

24:13.770 --> 24:14.770
start of that journey

24:14.770 --> 24:21.120
quite a remarkable achievement yeah yeah

24:21.120 --> 24:23.360
that's it

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
sup malison

24:24.360 --> 24:38.890
okay

24:38.890 --> 24:42.910
coming down easy at borehole 10-x rick

24:42.910 --> 24:44.790
lagina and the oak island team have

24:44.790 --> 24:47.750
hired a commercial diving company rmi

24:47.750 --> 24:50.490
marine to clear away rusted pipes and

24:50.490 --> 24:53.390
other debris that have been blocking the

24:53.390 --> 24:55.230
27-inch portion of the shaft for decades

24:55.230 --> 24:59.490
it is a mission that is both complicated

24:59.490 --> 25:05.950
and extremely dangerous

25:05.950 --> 25:07.790
even with the four hundred gallon per

25:07.790 --> 25:10.970
minute pump and nearby borehole to a1x

25:10.970 --> 25:12.970
which keeps the water in the shaft down

25:12.970 --> 25:15.360
approximately 40 feet below normal

25:15.360 --> 25:19.679
levels diver Jonathan Moyles will still

25:19.679 --> 25:22.020
need to make a descent in frigid water

25:22.020 --> 25:33.559
for more than 100 feet

25:33.559 --> 25:35.920
because of the enormous pressure he will

25:35.920 --> 25:38.090
only be able to work in the shaft for

25:38.090 --> 25:40.460
not longer than 30 minutes before

25:40.460 --> 25:42.810
needing to slowly make his way back to

25:42.810 --> 25:45.070
the surface when you're breathing

25:45.070 --> 25:46.960
compressed air the nitrogen is also

25:46.960 --> 25:49.059
compressed it goes into the solvency or

25:49.059 --> 25:51.090
into your bloodstream and then you come

25:51.090 --> 25:53.420
up but it comes out as bubbles homes

25:53.420 --> 25:55.309
little nasty nitrogen bubbles and they

25:55.309 --> 25:59.690
Lodge in your brain or your lung during

25:59.690 --> 26:02.299
the dive nitrogen gas has become highly

26:02.299 --> 26:05.190
compressed in the human body when the

26:05.190 --> 26:07.840
diver is ready to surface he or she must

26:07.840 --> 26:10.679
do so in short stages allowing their

26:10.679 --> 26:13.860
body to decompress otherwise the

26:13.860 --> 26:16.799
nitrogen accumulates and forms bubbles

26:16.799 --> 26:19.970
in the bloodstream it is a condition

26:19.970 --> 26:22.840
commonly referred to as the bends and

26:22.840 --> 26:25.260
results in the diver experiencing joint

26:25.260 --> 26:28.120
pain disorientation and in the worst

26:28.120 --> 26:45.570
cases

26:45.570 --> 26:47.460
there's no magic bullet for this

26:47.460 --> 26:51.110
visibility issues are are a problem what

26:51.110 --> 26:52.640
they're professionals and they're just

26:52.640 --> 26:55.430
gonna have to deal with to secure large

26:55.430 --> 26:58.760
debris and send it to the surface diver

26:58.760 --> 27:01.280
Jonathan Niles will use a rope fling

27:01.280 --> 27:07.260
known as an octopus for smaller objects

27:07.260 --> 27:10.600
he will use a steel basket the same one

27:10.600 --> 27:13.480
that was used by dan Blankenship when he

27:13.480 --> 27:16.610
dug 10x more than 40 years ago

27:16.610 --> 27:24.040
thank you all good start bringing up the

27:24.040 --> 27:35.870
crane we're gonna start coming up easy

27:35.870 --> 27:42.640
buddy coming to service

27:42.640 --> 27:54.480
a little more cleared out there down

27:54.480 --> 28:04.919
yeah keep coming to butts emptiness now

28:04.919 --> 28:06.950
that most of the debris has been removed

28:06.950 --> 28:10.690
from the 181 foot level of 10x hoping

28:10.690 --> 28:12.900
for a little more sediment the team

28:12.900 --> 28:16.450
still needs to remove one more obstacle

28:16.450 --> 28:18.940
a six foot long piece of metal casing

28:18.940 --> 28:21.780
that lines the upper portion of the

28:21.780 --> 28:26.130
27-inch hole what I'm hoping for is one

28:26.130 --> 28:29.190
simple statement is the casing above the

28:29.190 --> 28:30.690
anhydrate or is it big low the integrity

28:30.690 --> 28:33.480
because then at that point we can

28:33.480 --> 28:35.169
develop a protocol if you will or a

28:35.169 --> 28:37.710
procedure how are we gonna latch on to

28:37.710 --> 28:40.060
it and pull it off it to bother you

28:40.060 --> 28:41.990
right away but what's your thoughts how

28:41.990 --> 28:44.220
much of the steel is above the anhydrite

28:44.220 --> 28:46.040
on one side it's probably put that fire

28:46.040 --> 28:48.200
in a heaven hey there hydrate you think

28:48.200 --> 28:51.350
we should try pulling now yeah the

28:51.350 --> 28:54.580
thought now is to use these clamps which

28:54.580 --> 28:57.690
bite as you exert pressure on the

28:57.690 --> 29:01.710
upstroke so they'll clamp on and we'll

29:01.710 --> 29:02.850
pull from there

29:02.850 --> 29:04.830
so basically Rick got just cams open

29:04.830 --> 29:07.260
like that see it's cantilever yeah it's

29:07.260 --> 29:10.200
got all the edges on it it just comes on

29:10.200 --> 29:13.559
it's not gonna grab that well clamp

29:13.559 --> 29:16.250
lock it up so you're gonna put tension

29:16.250 --> 29:18.660
on this yes where you clamp it off yes

29:18.660 --> 29:24.870
are you soaked Dave uh-huh yeah

29:24.870 --> 29:27.510
no no yeah diver Dave cousins will now

29:27.510 --> 29:30.900
descend 10x in an attempt to attach the

29:30.900 --> 29:38.049
steel clamps to the 27-inch casing

29:38.049 --> 29:40.549
once the diver attaches the clamps which

29:40.549 --> 29:42.900
have jagged ridges that allow for a firm

29:42.900 --> 29:46.370
hold the boom crane will lift upwards

29:46.370 --> 29:49.110
pulling the casing from the 27-inch hole

29:49.110 --> 29:50.110
and out of the shaft

29:50.110 --> 30:02.559
all right it's coming down now on a rope

30:02.559 --> 30:05.929
should be right to the ground if we can

30:05.929 --> 30:10.240
fall of 27 inches pretty good day got

30:10.240 --> 30:15.690
another 10 minutes what would normally

30:15.690 --> 30:18.730
be an easy operation for Dave cousins

30:18.730 --> 30:22.630
has suddenly become extremely difficult

30:22.630 --> 30:24.650
not only is he trying to attach the

30:24.650 --> 30:27.040
steel clamps to the casing in virtual

30:27.040 --> 30:30.559
darkness but the steel casing is heavily

30:30.559 --> 30:33.850
corroded and slick with decades of mud

30:33.850 --> 30:40.450
and sludge to make matters worse he is

30:40.450 --> 30:43.580
almost out of time

30:43.580 --> 30:48.130
we got two more minutes

30:48.130 --> 30:54.360
we need to come up on the crane Dave

30:54.360 --> 30:56.290
Cousins has finally gotten the clamps

30:56.290 --> 30:59.750
attached now the boom crane will attempt

30:59.750 --> 31:01.930
to pull the casing out of the hole

31:32.730 --> 31:43.320
Oh stop

31:43.320 --> 31:45.700
rick lagina's mission to remove six feet

31:45.700 --> 31:48.520
of steel casing from the 27-inch portion

31:48.520 --> 31:51.500
of 10x has just been put in serious

31:51.500 --> 31:54.789
jeopardy as the boom cable began lifting

31:54.789 --> 31:57.670
on the clamps attached to the rim one of

31:57.670 --> 31:58.820
them came loose

31:58.820 --> 32:03.740
leaving the casing stuck in the hole all

32:03.740 --> 32:16.990
right I'm gonna get your umbilical and

32:16.990 --> 32:20.910
we're gonna start coming up on you

32:20.910 --> 32:23.539
unfortunately diver Dave Cousins

32:23.539 --> 32:25.970
has no time left to make a second

32:25.970 --> 32:29.360
attempt the six feet of steel casing

32:29.360 --> 32:32.000
will have to remain in the hole

32:32.000 --> 32:34.910
you take a negative and you try to see a

32:34.910 --> 32:37.460
positive in it we now know something we

32:37.460 --> 32:39.610
didn't know yesterday we got some

32:39.610 --> 32:41.840
information learns where we need to go

32:41.840 --> 32:44.240
from here because at the end of the day

32:44.240 --> 32:46.270
given all the difficulties I am more

32:46.270 --> 32:48.429
firmly committed than ever to accomplish

32:48.429 --> 32:51.120
the goal the goal being get a diver into

32:51.120 --> 32:54.710
the cavity at to the floor at 235 thank

32:54.710 --> 32:56.400
you for all your efforts welcome just

32:56.400 --> 33:00.090
want to go thank the guys Dave thank you

33:00.090 --> 33:08.309
thank you
okay well here's the thing

33:08.309 --> 33:13.270
typical Kyle and we want to feel this

33:13.270 --> 33:16.309
time we kinda lost the war you know what

33:16.309 --> 33:17.950
we lived we lived to fight another day

33:17.950 --> 33:24.410
let's let's go home

33:24.410 --> 33:31.840
after the dive team has completed

33:31.840 --> 33:34.350
clearing most of the obstructions from

33:34.350 --> 33:37.289
10x okay so this is 10x phase one

33:37.289 --> 33:40.650
completed really Marty and Rick lagina

33:40.650 --> 33:42.799
returned to the site to review the

33:42.799 --> 33:45.360
team's progress divers have been written

33:45.360 --> 33:49.120
whole this is nice in my opinion it was

33:49.120 --> 33:51.450
marginal results they were intrepid they

33:51.450 --> 33:53.160
were fearless like they went down hole

33:53.160 --> 33:54.230
they couldn't see the hand in front of

33:54.230 --> 33:56.070
their face I think we have to adjust

33:56.070 --> 33:58.460
show me what you got on a little

33:58.460 --> 34:01.370
okay so here's the ten inch we gotta

34:01.370 --> 34:04.410
hunt 141 plus or minus there's a voice

34:04.410 --> 34:06.820
drill that's the limited amount of

34:06.820 --> 34:09.440
garbage they wear but we'll pull off

34:09.440 --> 34:11.239
that's it I think you did great

34:11.239 --> 34:14.418
personally these guys did a lot of work

34:14.418 --> 34:16.020
a lot of work it's not easy for that

34:16.020 --> 34:18.000
pipe to be pulled and laid down and cut

34:18.000 --> 34:20.250
in pieces and I think Rick feels they

34:20.250 --> 34:21.690
didn't make much progress but I think

34:21.690 --> 34:24.590
they made a lot of progress I take it

34:24.590 --> 34:27.050
this is the one we dropped that's the

34:27.050 --> 34:31.050
one we dropped let's plug in the bottom

34:31.050 --> 34:32.889
well you don't want write effectively

34:32.889 --> 34:36.060
what we did record it yeah record it

34:36.060 --> 34:38.550
look at the impact forces you know what

34:38.550 --> 34:39.899
it would take to curl the end of that

34:39.899 --> 34:43.119
steel like that a lot

34:43.119 --> 34:44.679
problem is this right here I'm thinking

34:44.679 --> 34:46.420
maybe this is grown-up anhydrate or at

34:46.420 --> 34:48.510
least partially I know in the subsurface

34:48.510 --> 34:50.109
this is how it cuts it's really really

34:50.109 --> 34:52.489
gummy it drills great because it's soft

34:52.489 --> 34:53.630
but then also in it quits the drilling

34:53.630 --> 34:56.139
because it's just it gums everything up

34:56.139 --> 34:58.370
it's bullshit exactly that gets on top

34:58.370 --> 35:00.910
the bit then you pull up into it you

35:00.910 --> 35:03.580
just don't love your stuck button that's

35:03.580 --> 35:06.040
what I'm kind of worried about well you

35:06.040 --> 35:08.710
know then then that begs the option of

35:08.710 --> 35:11.420
you know do we find a diver to dive the

35:11.420 --> 35:13.670
27-inch and leave the 32 option off the

35:13.670 --> 35:16.200
table if that could be done safely Rick

35:16.200 --> 35:18.560
I you know I yeah that would be great

35:18.560 --> 35:20.590
cuz once we go in and widen that hole

35:20.590 --> 35:24.830
you destabilize things I guess a little

35:24.830 --> 35:28.060
Rick Marty and the Oak Island team are

35:28.060 --> 35:31.130
now faced with a grim reality the

35:31.130 --> 35:34.310
inability to remove the six foot long

35:34.310 --> 35:36.570
metal sleeve coupled with the

35:36.570 --> 35:39.500
instability of the anhydride layer has

35:39.500 --> 35:42.180
ruled out the possibility of widening

35:42.180 --> 35:45.670
the narrow 27-inch portion of 10x at the

35:45.670 --> 35:49.300
end of the day this is results-oriented

35:49.300 --> 35:50.690
and I don't believe we were as

35:50.690 --> 35:53.540
successful as we should have been in

35:53.540 --> 35:55.650
order to continue that process we have

35:55.650 --> 35:58.200
to change the directions they will now

35:58.200 --> 36:01.210
need to find a diver skilled enough and

36:01.210 --> 36:04.000
brave enough to risk their life in order

36:04.000 --> 36:07.680
to find out once and for all what if

36:07.680 --> 36:11.340
anything lies at the bottom we know we

36:11.340 --> 36:13.720
can get a man down the existing 27-inch

36:13.720 --> 36:16.340
hole dan Blankenship did it a dozen

36:16.340 --> 36:19.290
times so there may be other divers who

36:19.290 --> 36:22.560
are willing to do that this is a tougher

36:22.560 --> 36:38.760
nut than I realized

36:38.760 --> 36:40.340
gentlemen we're here to talk about

36:40.340 --> 36:43.080
diving today and how on earth we can get

36:43.080 --> 36:45.180
to the bottom of that 10x into that

36:45.180 --> 36:50.600
cavity safely with a diver after

36:50.600 --> 36:52.910
spending the last several days clearing

36:52.910 --> 36:54.990
out corroded riser pipes and other

36:54.990 --> 36:57.840
debris

36:57.840 --> 37:00.690
Rick and Marty lagina must now find an

37:00.690 --> 37:03.340
experienced diver who will attempt one

37:03.340 --> 37:07.359
of the most dangerous dives in the world

37:07.359 --> 37:11.680
to descend 181 feet through the 8 foot

37:11.680 --> 37:14.380
wide steel and cement lined casing and

37:14.380 --> 37:18.349
then down an additional 44 feet through

37:18.349 --> 37:22.430
a narrow 27-inch wide hole all the way

37:22.430 --> 37:25.040
to what appears to be a mysterious

37:25.040 --> 37:28.369
underground chamber

37:28.369 --> 37:30.020
we've got John tapper here he is an

37:30.020 --> 37:31.320
expert he's gonna tell us about the

37:31.320 --> 37:33.040
technical issues with regards to getting

37:33.040 --> 37:42.690
a person into the chamber at 10x a

37:42.690 --> 37:44.830
professional diver John tapper was

37:44.830 --> 37:47.430
brought in last year to help the team

37:47.430 --> 37:48.800
during their previous though

37:48.800 --> 37:51.770
unsuccessful attempt to reach what dan

37:51.770 --> 37:54.830
Blankenship the man who dug 10x 40 years

37:54.830 --> 37:58.710
ago described as a 10 foot tall man-made

37:58.710 --> 38:00.780
treasure vault

38:00.780 --> 38:03.460
why don't I sketch out the parameters

38:03.460 --> 38:05.349
and then you can tell me the challenges

38:05.349 --> 38:09.080
the cavity is roughly 10 feet by 12 feet

38:09.080 --> 38:13.109
irregular shape visibility is awful and

38:13.109 --> 38:14.820
in there there are some things that we

38:14.820 --> 38:18.369
want to find out what they are there's a

38:18.369 --> 38:21.530
potentiality of a post there is some

38:21.530 --> 38:25.100
indication there's a chest and then Dan

38:25.100 --> 38:27.609
said this years ago but it's been Rivera

38:27.609 --> 38:30.030
fiying that there could be a body in

38:30.030 --> 38:32.140
there of uncertain

38:32.140 --> 38:34.450
origin and age do you think he's dead

38:34.450 --> 38:41.710
Marty if he's not dead I'm out of here

38:41.710 --> 38:44.150
well regards to getting someone down

38:44.150 --> 38:46.480
there the depth is a problem after you

38:46.480 --> 38:50.040
pass 100 feet on air you're starting a

38:50.040 --> 38:54.460
look at nitrogen narcosis

38:54.460 --> 38:56.650
nitrogen narcosis presents a very real

38:56.650 --> 38:59.000
threat to divers who descend to depths

38:59.000 --> 39:02.080
greater than 100 feet it occurs as a

39:02.080 --> 39:04.730
result of breathing air under higher

39:04.730 --> 39:07.320
than atmospheric pressure and can make

39:07.320 --> 39:09.190
divers feel as though they are

39:09.190 --> 39:13.770
intoxicated so we're doubling that depth

39:13.770 --> 39:17.050
where people generally start to feel the

39:17.050 --> 39:19.700
effect so at 200 feet you're drunk

39:19.700 --> 39:21.970
basically basically yes you really can't

39:21.970 --> 39:24.770
be 100% sure of what you're seeing

39:24.770 --> 39:27.520
people have seen a lot of a lot of crazy

39:27.520 --> 39:28.520
stuff underwater

39:28.520 --> 39:31.100
plus if anything does happen you don't

39:31.100 --> 39:33.920
have the mental capacity to deal with it

39:33.920 --> 39:36.770
why don't you talk about the gases well

39:36.770 --> 39:40.340
if we switch over to the trimix knife

39:40.340 --> 39:42.349
with nitrogen and oxygen for your

39:42.349 --> 39:44.800
decompression gas if you're down there

39:44.800 --> 39:47.580
you're feeling much better and able to

39:47.580 --> 39:50.890
respond to what you need to do the

39:50.890 --> 39:53.410
trimix breathing system blends oxygen

39:53.410 --> 39:56.599
and nitrogen with helium as one of the

39:56.599 --> 39:59.980
only gases not affected by depth helium

39:59.980 --> 40:01.740
helps minimize the possibility of

40:01.740 --> 40:05.010
narcosis and allows for a safer and more

40:05.010 --> 40:08.450
successful dive operation

40:08.450 --> 40:10.470
not new this died without doing it on a

40:10.470 --> 40:13.080
trimix we still need a diver who's

40:13.080 --> 40:16.050
qualified with nitrox and makes gases

40:16.050 --> 40:19.070
yes and that's a significant step up in

40:19.070 --> 40:21.210
terms of qualification of the diver yes

40:21.210 --> 40:22.890
that's going from one end of the scale

40:22.890 --> 40:24.720
to the other it's finding someone

40:24.720 --> 40:26.970
skilled enough and physically qualified

40:26.970 --> 40:30.230
enough to do the dive yes John is making

40:30.230 --> 40:32.070
it clear that this is not a routine dive

40:32.070 --> 40:34.140
this is gonna take a fully accredited

40:34.140 --> 40:37.420
kind of a specialty diver person and

40:37.420 --> 40:39.520
that is going to be a small amount of

40:39.520 --> 40:42.160
people so it's gonna be a small pool to

40:42.160 --> 40:44.460
choose from we'll find someone there's

40:44.460 --> 40:46.930
always somebody somewhere who can do

40:46.930 --> 40:48.780
anything it's just a matter of reaching

40:48.780 --> 40:52.120
out to the right person we'll find them

40:52.120 --> 40:54.580
well let's let's get on that too I think

40:54.580 --> 40:55.760
we're all done here we got a lot to do

40:55.760 --> 40:56.760
let's go do it

40:56.760 --> 41:01.740
agreed Rick Marty and their partners

41:01.740 --> 41:03.930
leave the war room more determined than

41:03.930 --> 41:06.960
ever to hire a diver we'll be able to

41:06.960 --> 41:09.170
get to the bottom of 10x

41:09.170 --> 41:11.450
fool they find

41:11.450 --> 41:14.500
we'll have the experience and the

41:14.500 --> 41:17.040
courage to perform one of the most

41:17.040 --> 41:20.560
difficult and dangerous underwater dives

41:20.560 --> 41:21.560
ever attempted

41:21.560 --> 41:25.130
and once down there

41:25.130 --> 41:30.010
what will they find next time on the

41:30.010 --> 41:36.760
curse of Oak Island someone used this to

41:36.760 --> 41:39.390
bury extremely high-value cargo this

41:39.390 --> 41:41.130
will be the first remote operated

41:41.130 --> 41:43.270
vehicle in the cavern we have

41:43.270 --> 41:44.940
expectations that we're gonna see men

41:44.940 --> 41:45.940
made objects

41:45.940 --> 41:47.640
we're in the cavern now there's

41:47.640 --> 41:49.420
something every square that's gray

41:49.420 --> 41:54.050
square I mean what is that if there

41:54.050 --> 41:55.780
wouldn't that's irrefutable proof that

41:55.780 --> 41:57.150
changes everything

41:57.174 --> 41:59.174
