00:59.117 --> 01:02.988
Eight perfect slices.
Ugh, Raps, do you mind?

01:03.076 --> 01:07.394
What?

01:13.827 --> 01:15.997
Lance, please.

01:16.372 --> 01:19.545
Yes, please,
the song is awful.

01:20.138 --> 01:22.010
Speaking of awful,
I see you're looking at

01:22.106 --> 01:23.556
yourself again, pretty boy.

01:23.697 --> 01:25.570
Well, it beats
looking at you.

01:25.657 --> 01:27.918
Besides, without proper
brow maintenance,

01:28.006 --> 01:30.070
the smolder cannot
work to full effect.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.552
If the effect you're
going for is to make me nauseous,

01:32.670 --> 01:34.280
I'd say it's
working perfectly.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.199
Well, it wasn't
what I was going for,

01:36.287 --> 01:38.685
but since you are nauseated,
let's call it a happy accident.

01:38.773 --> 01:40.521
I'll show you
a "happy accident."

01:40.609 --> 01:43.171
Oops, my bad.

01:43.259 --> 01:46.208
See that? Even the frog can't
stand your whistling anymore.

01:46.296 --> 01:49.280
Oh yeah? And what does the little
greenie-weenie know about music?

01:49.367 --> 01:51.406
He doesn't even have ears.

01:53.957 --> 01:57.160
And you with the scratching.

01:57.247 --> 02:00.117
What could you possibly
be drawing in that journal now?

02:01.685 --> 02:06.410
Well, I would try to explain it, but
you clearly know nothing about art.

02:06.497 --> 02:10.410
Ugh, okay, that was mean.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, look.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.870
I know our little ticks are
getting on each other's nerves,

02:12.957 --> 02:15.910
because we are
all stuck in here together.

02:15.997 --> 02:19.280
But on the bright side,
we're all in here together.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.570
So, let's just have some fun with it.

02:21.657 --> 02:25.200
Lance, if you do not stop
whistling, I will throttle you!

02:31.697 --> 02:33.370
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

02:37.157 --> 02:40.320
Well, it's official.
We are stuck.

02:40.407 --> 02:43.157
I guess we'll just have
to wait out the storm in here.

02:43.747 --> 02:46.157
Or maybe not.

02:47.367 --> 02:51.320
Raps, I know what you're thinking,
but that place creeps me out.

02:51.407 --> 02:54.950
- Hang on, I want to have a look.
- Ugh, could you be more annoying?

02:55.037 --> 02:57.450
- Hmm, let me see.
- Ow!

02:57.537 --> 02:59.450
Ha-ha! Would you
look at that? I can be.

02:59.537 --> 03:01.724
Look, Raps, I can see
where this is going.

03:01.812 --> 03:03.343
You're going to say
something like,

03:03.431 --> 03:04.910
 "That shell house looks like
a warm, dry place."

03:04.997 --> 03:08.451
And then I say, "Let's not rush into
anything. We should be careful..."

03:08.787 --> 03:10.914
And they're gone.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.870
Hello! We are
so sorry to bother you,

03:25.957 --> 03:29.110
but our caravan
got stuck in the mud.

03:29.197 --> 03:31.030
A carriage stuck in the mud,

03:31.117 --> 03:33.370
is a carriage
that's quite a dud.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.990
It's a rhyme.
Look how wet all of you are.

03:38.077 --> 03:40.335
Do you suppose that's
because of the rain?

03:40.423 --> 03:41.700
Uh, could we come in?

03:41.787 --> 03:46.030
Of course, of course. My name is
Matthews, and you are all welcome.

03:46.117 --> 03:47.740
Except the horses.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.370
They shed too much and leave 'oof
prints in the carpeting. Oui?

03:51.457 --> 03:53.240
It's the stable for you!

04:01.827 --> 04:04.910
Wow! This place is amazing.

04:04.997 --> 04:07.200
It is, yes,
but so are pockets.

04:07.287 --> 04:10.410
You can put anything in one, so long
as it's smaller than the pocket itself.

04:10.497 --> 04:13.214
You know, I like to put
my hands in mine.

04:13.537 --> 04:18.197
Right, okay. So, this
place is made entirely of shells?

04:18.457 --> 04:20.490
I see you've noticed.
Let me guess.

04:20.577 --> 04:23.610
You must be the genius
of the group, oui?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.586
Indeed, a large shell
house

04:25.674 --> 04:27.634
 in the middle of the forest
doesn't seem to belong,

04:27.722 --> 04:29.820
but then again,
neither do you.

04:29.907 --> 04:31.240
And yet, here you are.

04:31.327 --> 04:34.570
There are refreshments in the lounge
and rooms enough for all of you.

04:34.657 --> 04:37.320
Thank you so much, Mr. Matthews.

04:37.408 --> 04:40.140
And, don't worry, you won't even
know that we're...

04:40.261 --> 04:42.696
Shorty, put those down!

04:42.784 --> 04:45.240
I said, put those down!

04:45.327 --> 04:48.780
- No, you said, "Shorty, put those down."
- You are ridiculous.

04:48.867 --> 04:51.780
- Stop scolding him.
- Thank you, Cassandra.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.901
Stay out of this, Lance.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.270
Um...
Mr. Matthews,

04:56.358 --> 04:59.645
it's so beautiful here.
What is this place?

04:59.836 --> 05:03.887
It's called, "The House
of Yesterday's Tomorrow."

05:04.012 --> 05:09.598
"Yesterday's Tomorrow."
So, then, today?

05:09.715 --> 05:13.801
I never use one word where
two will do, right, correct?

05:14.178 --> 05:16.324
Sure... I guess.

05:16.457 --> 05:20.486
Oh, you're just milking it now.
Here are the guest bedrooms.

05:20.574 --> 05:24.997
Please, enjoy your stay...
however long that may be.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.824
Here, Shorty, at least
wipe your face.

05:32.957 --> 05:34.867
Not my style.

05:38.077 --> 05:40.449
- Something's not right.
- What'd you mean?

05:40.537 --> 05:43.280
I mean, why is this huge place just
sitting here, in the middle of nowhere?

05:43.367 --> 05:45.740
And that guy, or inn keeper,
or whatever he is,

05:45.827 --> 05:48.530
just takes us in, offers us food
and a place to stay

05:48.617 --> 05:51.284
for the night, without asking
for a single coin?

05:58.617 --> 06:02.792
Hello, handsome. Can you tell me
where to find the dining hall?

06:07.680 --> 06:10.930
Hey, don't I know you?

06:14.577 --> 06:16.610
I'm telling you,
it just doesn't make sense.

06:16.697 --> 06:19.990
Look, Cass, I know this is
weird, but you gotta admit,

06:20.077 --> 06:22.780
this isn't the weirdest thing
we've seen on the road.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.620
What're you two waiting for?
Dinner's ready.

06:29.117 --> 06:31.355
Ugh, fine.

06:37.636 --> 06:39.570
Come on, would you put
that thing down?

06:39.657 --> 06:42.722
And why would I? You
never put your sword down.

06:55.697 --> 07:00.230
Shorty, you're using a napkin
instead of... nothing.

07:00.457 --> 07:04.901
Oh, so I am, huh.
Please, pass the bread.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.558
- Thank you.
- "Thank you"?

07:09.675 --> 07:13.581
Uh... Beard, yam!

07:17.037 --> 07:19.617
Shorty, are you feeling okay?

07:25.657 --> 07:30.110
Um, what do you mean exactly when you
say "Something's wrong with Shorty"?

07:30.261 --> 07:32.990
Didn't you see him at dinner?
Perfect posture,

07:33.077 --> 07:37.030
impeccable manners, his breath
wasn't... stomach-churning.

07:37.117 --> 07:40.589
- Something is off.
- You're beginning to sound like Cass.

07:40.714 --> 07:44.722
I'm serious.
Shorty isn't... right.

07:44.870 --> 07:47.790
It's almost like he was somebody
else pretending to be Shorty.

07:47.878 --> 07:49.474
Oh! Wait, here he comes, quick!

07:49.562 --> 07:50.878
Quick, in here.

07:55.281 --> 07:58.847
- What's he doing?
- I don't know, it's Shorty.

07:58.957 --> 08:00.894
He probably thinks
he made a new friend.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.565
Look, I'm not seeing anything
out of the ordinary.

08:04.827 --> 08:05.888
Hey, Shorty.

08:05.976 --> 08:09.239
Well, if it isn't my stalwart
companion, Lance Wardington.

08:09.327 --> 08:12.530
You're looking extraordinarily dapper.
Take a look for yourself.

08:12.618 --> 08:16.358
I literally wear the same thing every
day, but thanks for noticing... Aah!

08:20.653 --> 08:22.153
Wha...?

08:23.169 --> 08:27.707
We have to find out what these impostors,
or doubles or whatever they are, want.

08:27.795 --> 08:29.897
But we have to be careful.

08:30.100 --> 08:32.070
Careful, got it.

08:32.157 --> 08:35.193
All right, half-pint.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.368
Wha...? Aah!

08:38.457 --> 08:40.570
Eugene!

08:40.657 --> 08:42.530
He must be working out.

08:42.616 --> 08:45.702
You are messing
with the wrong people!

08:45.790 --> 08:47.866
'Cause if you think
we're scared of a couple of

08:47.954 --> 08:50.409
living reflections
with crazy strength,

08:50.497 --> 08:53.266
well, think again!

09:02.134 --> 09:04.180
Okay, so explain this
to me again?

09:04.277 --> 09:06.869
Lance and Shorty
aren't Lance and Shorty?

09:06.957 --> 09:09.569
Look, I don't get it either,
but that is not Shorty.

09:09.657 --> 09:11.430
I mean, this Shorty
knocked me down.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.885
I once saw the real
Shorty lose a fight...

09:13.997 --> 09:16.700
to a trout... on dry land.

09:16.891 --> 09:18.910
So, where are the real
Lance and Shorty?

09:19.071 --> 09:22.374
I'm not sure. But, somehow,
I think they're

09:22.462 --> 09:25.212
trapped inside that
mirror from the hallway.

09:25.321 --> 09:29.370
- Okay, this is just insane.
- It is insane.

09:29.457 --> 09:33.490
Don't believe her, Cassandra.
I'm the real Shorty.

09:33.577 --> 09:37.490
Okay, okay. Shorty knowing
who Cassandra is, is fishy,

09:37.577 --> 09:39.032
but him knowing who he is?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.449
There is definitely something
to this impostor thing.

09:41.537 --> 09:45.740
Of course, the question becomes
if they're not really them,

09:45.827 --> 09:50.407
how do we know the rest of us
are who we say we are?

09:55.657 --> 09:59.530
Okay, if we're gonna get our real friends
back, we have to know who to trust.

09:59.617 --> 10:04.200
So, I have to conduct some tests to
prove there are no more impostors.

10:04.287 --> 10:06.570
Hold on, you're going
to conduct the tests?

10:06.657 --> 10:10.240
- Well, you could be a mirror person too.
- Ugh, you're right.

10:10.327 --> 10:11.747
How do you want
to test me?

10:14.287 --> 10:18.280
 The real Rapunzel can find the
art in even the dullest situations.

10:18.507 --> 10:20.023
Turn it into
something beautiful.

10:20.249 --> 10:23.327
Okay, okay.
All right, let's see.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.490
And... voila!

10:30.577 --> 10:32.280
A diorama of Corona.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.780
I am impressed.
But any respectable artist

10:34.867 --> 10:37.530
would be able to create
a completely edible repilca...

10:37.617 --> 10:40.910
- Aah! Uncle Monty!
- Yeah, that's her.

10:40.997 --> 10:43.457
Now, who's next?

10:44.287 --> 10:48.617
Okay, Pascal, show me
the colors of the Corona flag.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.327
Good. Now how about
the color of a bimberry?

10:55.367 --> 10:58.787
Ooh! Now do the color that Lance turned
when he got poisoned by that spider bite.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.990
You know, I'm not even the real
Lance, but that's messed up.

11:03.077 --> 11:04.820
All right, rapid fire.

11:04.907 --> 11:09.490
Old lady Crowley. Ulf! Ulf's
favorite color! My favorite color!

11:09.577 --> 11:14.117
That's right! Because all of them
are equally amazing in their own way.

11:16.117 --> 11:18.327
He's the real Pascal!
Next test.

11:19.197 --> 11:21.570
Okay, Eugene,
just a couple of questions.

11:21.657 --> 11:24.660
- Fire away, blondie.
- First, what is Maximus's favorite food?

11:24.747 --> 11:26.910
- Apples.
- What is Pete the Guard's middle name?

11:26.997 --> 11:28.570
The. Also, Stan's middle name.

11:28.657 --> 11:33.030
Correct. Now, which of these posters
is an accurate representation

11:33.117 --> 11:37.530
of the real Eugene Fitzherbet,
aka Flynn Rider?

11:37.617 --> 11:42.570
Ooh... Trick question! No artist
can accurately capture all of this.

11:42.657 --> 11:46.280
- That's Eugene!
- Cass, you're up.

11:46.367 --> 11:49.990
Now, I was going to write in my journal
to see if the noise bothered you,

11:50.077 --> 11:55.530
but I must have left it in the caravan.
However, I did find this apple.

11:55.617 --> 11:59.610
So, Cass, chop this into eight
perfect slices.

11:59.697 --> 12:01.780
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

12:01.867 --> 12:05.950
- Well, I'm... I-I could break something.
- You got room.

12:06.037 --> 12:08.740
Did you see this rug?
It'll make a mess.

12:08.827 --> 12:11.160
- Cass!
- All right, all right, all right.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.247
All right.

12:17.957 --> 12:19.657
Yeah, I'm gonna
go with not Cass.

12:24.157 --> 12:25.197
Aah!

12:39.617 --> 12:42.700
Okay, we're back
in the armoire again.

12:42.787 --> 12:44.280
That was close.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.700
Are you okay?
Where's the chameleon?

12:46.787 --> 12:49.570
Wait. Did you just call
Pascal a chameleon?

12:49.657 --> 12:54.247
- Wait?
- So there's my journal!

12:55.497 --> 12:57.700
That's how you know
my secrets!

12:57.787 --> 13:00.740
No! I was just holding
the journal.

13:00.827 --> 13:03.870
- You dropped it, and, uh...
- Do the smolder.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.287
Uh...

13:05.697 --> 13:07.747
Ay!

13:08.537 --> 13:10.117
You're not Eugene!

13:11.287 --> 13:15.610
Okay, but you gotta admit, I had this
Eugene guy down pretty well, right?

13:15.697 --> 13:18.320
I mean, I was way better
than the other doubles.

13:18.407 --> 13:19.610
Shorty.

13:19.697 --> 13:21.870
But how? When?

13:21.957 --> 13:26.990
Oh, Rapunzel, Eugene was the first
of you to gaze into our mirror.

13:27.077 --> 13:28.657
Oh, come on,
you can't be surprised.

13:30.247 --> 13:33.327
Ah, looks like a little hair
out of place... Aah!

13:39.157 --> 13:41.780
But Shorty threw you.

13:41.867 --> 13:46.780
Well, I had to keep up appearances
until we could get you into the mirror.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.610
What have you done
with my friends?

13:58.957 --> 14:03.617
I said we shouldn't come to this
place, but did anyone listen? No.

14:04.247 --> 14:08.240
No, we did not. But in our
defense, we never listen to you!

14:08.327 --> 14:12.070
- You know what, Fitzherbjerk, I've had about enough of your...
- Guys, guys!

14:12.157 --> 14:15.740
Is all this bickering solving anything?
I mean, we've been doing

14:15.827 --> 14:18.740
nothing but getting on each other's
nerves for the last three weeks.

14:18.827 --> 14:20.320
And look where it's gotten us.

14:20.407 --> 14:24.200
I really hate admitting this,
but Lance is... right.

14:24.287 --> 14:26.699
This isn't helping.
If we've got any chance of

14:26.787 --> 14:28.320
getting out of here,
it's got to be together.

14:28.407 --> 14:32.410
Exactly. So, let's see if we can find
a less painful way to get out of here?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.867
Come on, Shorty.

14:35.907 --> 14:37.530
What are you?!

14:37.617 --> 14:40.160
Rapunzel, don't run from us.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.660
It's so much better this way.

14:41.747 --> 14:43.700
No annoying qualities.

14:43.787 --> 14:45.530
No bickering.

14:45.617 --> 14:48.910
We share
the same mind. It's bliss.

14:48.997 --> 14:51.197
Pascal, run!

15:24.117 --> 15:26.070
With no one left to oppose us,

15:26.157 --> 15:29.700
- we will remain free forever.
- What of the lizard?

15:29.787 --> 15:32.407
Leave the lizard to me.

15:34.787 --> 15:36.820
Here lizard, lizard, lizard.

15:36.907 --> 15:40.787
Where are you?
Come out and show yourself.

15:44.287 --> 15:45.697
Pascal?

15:47.037 --> 15:48.867
Pascal, it's me!

15:50.157 --> 15:51.910
I knew you would know
it was the real me!

15:51.997 --> 15:56.110
Come on, we have to figure out
how to free our friends.

15:56.197 --> 15:57.740
Aah!

15:57.827 --> 15:59.577
They got you too, huh?

16:01.989 --> 16:04.934
Remember when we weren't
all trapped inside a mirror?

16:05.022 --> 16:06.194
That was great.

16:06.747 --> 16:09.559
Yeah, this really is this pits.

16:10.286 --> 16:11.596
Did you just say "the pits"?

16:11.684 --> 16:13.684
Whoa, you don't think
anything is the pits.

16:13.772 --> 16:15.825
You even call cherry pits
"fruit rocks."

16:15.950 --> 16:20.489
No, no, no. I-I meant this is not
the pits.

16:20.577 --> 16:24.787
- You are not Rapunzel!
- Yeah! What are you?

16:26.157 --> 16:30.537
I could tell you. But it would
probably be better to show you.

16:35.867 --> 16:38.660
Exactly how is showing us
better than telling us?

16:44.157 --> 16:47.610
My reflection's gone. I wonder if
the guys figured out it's not me.

16:47.697 --> 16:52.780
It's definitely not her!
It's definitely not her!

16:52.867 --> 16:54.820
Oh, come on! No, no...

16:59.457 --> 17:03.320
Now, how did this mirror work?

17:03.407 --> 17:08.617
Rapunzel! If you can hear us, help!
There's a really freaky you in here!

17:10.117 --> 17:13.030
I got it! If we can get
those doubles to touch the mirror,

17:13.117 --> 17:15.867
it'll give our friends a chance
to switch back.

17:18.196 --> 17:20.957
How much do you think
this mirror weighs?

17:22.367 --> 17:27.367
This way, fellow mirror monsters.
I have located the repugnant lizard.

17:28.957 --> 17:30.490
Let's go.

17:30.577 --> 17:34.747
Come on, you reptile! You won't
get away from us this time!

17:35.657 --> 17:39.780
You know, I've had girlfriends
get pretty upset with me before,

17:39.867 --> 17:42.240
but a mirror demon girlfriend...

17:42.327 --> 17:43.867
that's a new one.

17:46.037 --> 17:48.327
We're not going down
without a fight!

17:54.287 --> 17:57.070
A... very short,
one-sided fight.

17:57.157 --> 17:59.780
Come on, guys, we're not gonna
beat this thing going toe-to-toe.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.287
We gotta play
to our strengths.

18:04.457 --> 18:05.907
Aah!

18:08.077 --> 18:10.117
Well, hey there, beautiful.

18:10.997 --> 18:12.030
Huh?

18:14.117 --> 18:15.910
Ah!

18:15.997 --> 18:17.070
Shorty, go!

18:27.157 --> 18:31.370
Ah, well, now that the scary, evil version
of my girlfriend is down for the count,

18:31.457 --> 18:33.787
what do you think
the real deal's up to?

18:40.617 --> 18:42.160
Come on.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.490
- Get 'em.
- Wait a second. Why aren't you...

18:45.577 --> 18:47.997
They're both real. Quick!
Get 'em into that mirror.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.410
Hey! Where is the mirror?

18:52.497 --> 18:55.110
Mirror...

18:55.197 --> 18:57.950
What mirror?

18:58.037 --> 19:00.110
Oh, "the mirror."

19:00.197 --> 19:04.157
Good question. Let me think.
Where did I see it last?

19:04.997 --> 19:08.327
Now I remember.
It's right here!

19:16.077 --> 19:19.077
- They're too strong!
- Man, you are heavy!

19:20.077 --> 19:22.657
We've got to get them
off balance.

19:31.867 --> 19:33.957
Now!

19:38.037 --> 19:40.110
Get in there,
you handsome devil!

19:42.787 --> 19:44.157
Ah!

19:48.287 --> 19:49.747
We did it!

19:52.697 --> 19:55.990
You know, I never thought I'd see
a mirror I didn't like looking at.

19:56.077 --> 19:59.247
Is it too late to trade him back
for the evil version?

20:14.827 --> 20:16.990
Well, I don't know about all
of you, but I'd take a night

20:17.077 --> 20:19.570
in that rainy caravan over
one in this inn any day.

20:19.657 --> 20:22.044
- I'm with you, Fitzherbert.
- Let's get out of here!

20:22.263 --> 20:24.280
Must you leave so soon?

20:24.367 --> 20:27.200
Or did you meet the people
in the mirror?

20:27.287 --> 20:32.200
I should have warned you about them.
Oh well! Live and learn! Or just live.

20:32.287 --> 20:36.780
The good news is you are welcome
to stay as long as you like.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.957
You might even grow
to enjoy it.

20:39.997 --> 20:43.070
Enjoy it? Uh, no thank you!

20:43.157 --> 20:46.240
We'll take our chances...
in the rain.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.617
I'll take first watch?

20:58.157 --> 21:01.870
Oh, right. Quill. Sorry.

21:01.957 --> 21:03.910
Actually, go ahead.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.950
What's a little scratching noise
among friends.

21:06.037 --> 21:09.419
Thanks, but I can
write about the mirror later.

21:09.763 --> 21:12.810
Something tells
me I will remember it.

21:24.466 --> 21:26.609
Anyone else having
trouble sleeping?

21:26.872 --> 21:31.197
You know what always makes
me feel better...
