02:12.048 --> 02:13.883
- No, you screwed it up!

02:13.925 --> 02:17.679
- The whole point of it was,
"I want to know the real Paris,

02:17.721 --> 02:20.598
not Paris Hilton."
And then what did you do?

02:20.640 --> 02:24.853
You ran to the fridge
with your little unicorn trot,

02:24.894 --> 02:26.146
got a bottle of rosé.

We met 15 years ago

- Obviously, when you see
somebody like Paris Hilton

out and about, she always has
a lot of people with her,

02:41.911 --> 02:44.289
a lot of people are always
vying for her attention.

I'm gonna throw on a jacket.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.883
Figured I don't want
to embarrass you,

02:54.924 --> 02:57.010

<i>I was sent</i>

<i>and many others were abused.</i>

03:35.048 --> 03:36.758

get ready soon

'cause I don't think
this is one of those things

03:39.844 --> 03:42.931
- What time does it start?
- Soon.

03:42.972 --> 03:47.018
- After doing my documentary
and finally telling my truth

03:47.060 --> 03:48.478
and just letting that all out,

03:48.520 --> 03:52.232
it's just been the most
healing experience of my life.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.525
I'm just grateful

03:53.566 --> 03:55.402
that I found you
at the perfect time in my life

03:55.443 --> 03:57.070
'cause if I didn't
do the documentary,

03:57.112 --> 03:58.863
I don't even know
if I would have been ready

03:58.905 --> 04:02.617
to ever open my heart to anyone
because I never have.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.370
And it's like,
from the moment that we kissed,

04:05.412 --> 04:06.538
I don't know,
there's this like--

04:06.579 --> 04:08.039
- Well, you kissed me first,
to be fair.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.708
- Okay, I did kiss you first.
- We don't have to--

04:09.749 --> 04:11.918
- Which I've never done
to a guy in my life.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.213
Everyone always does--
tries to do that to me...

04:15.255 --> 04:17.007
- [laughs]
- And I'm like, "No."

04:19.426 --> 04:21.011
I was engaged
twice before this,

04:21.052 --> 04:23.430
and my first one,
I just was way too young

04:23.471 --> 04:25.223
and just not ready.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.728
And the second one was just
definitely not the one.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.565
So I guess
third time's the charm.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.150
- I'm so proud of you.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.277
You've done so many
amazing things in your career.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.529
But after my dad passed away,
one of my big things

04:39.571 --> 04:42.032
was just always remembering
to, you know,

04:42.073 --> 04:44.159
celebrate the little things
or the wins along the way.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.620

you 'cause I love you so much.

<i>and what seemed</i>
<i>like invincible.</i>

<i>I went through kind of</i>
<i>all the stages of grief,</i>

05:06.890 --> 05:09.684
and when I met Paris,
it was kind of the first time

05:09.726 --> 05:12.645
where I kind of felt ready
to emotionally give myself

05:12.687 --> 05:14.689
<i>to somebody else,</i>
<i>and being there for Paris</i>

05:14.731 --> 05:17.108
<i>during what was</i>
<i>a very emotional time for her</i>

05:17.150 --> 05:20.195
as she kind of laid
her soul kind of bare

05:20.236 --> 05:22.030
to the rest of the world.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.448
I think that is
certainly something

05:23.490 --> 05:25.158
that brought us
very closely together.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.535
Can you believe it's been--
how long has it been--

05:27.577 --> 05:30.372

since that documentary

embraced the Paris that I knew

and you told me--let me in--

06:29.305 --> 06:32.058

Stop saying that.

- So excited!

09:30.320 --> 09:33.323
- Are you gonna do any crystals
or is that just staying?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.325
- Crystals, I think, actually
could be a cool idea.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.451
- Yeah.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.786
- 'Cause I love crystals.
- Let's do it.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.162
- All right, so which one

09:39.204 --> 09:40.372
should I try first
do you think?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.707
- Why don't we try
the ceremony shape first?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.167
- Okay.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.045
- Let's take it to the back.
- Yes.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.255
<i>I couldn't imagine anyone else</i>
<i>being my maid of honor.</i>

09:49.297 --> 09:51.925
<i>Nicky is my best friend</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

09:51.966 --> 09:54.636
- There's no one
I have fun with more.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.932
We just are silly together.

09:58.973 --> 10:03.311
<i>We go to each other</i>
<i>for advice on everything</i>

10:03.353 --> 10:07.565
from boys, love, um--

10:07.607 --> 10:10.193
- Fashion.
- Fashion. Everything.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.403
- Whoa!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.697
- Wow!
- Yes! Gorgeous.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.990
- Yes.
- Okay, let me help you up.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.659
- I'm the type that will,
like, trip over.

10:17.701 --> 10:19.494
- I'm--I'm aware.
[laughter]

10:19.536 --> 10:24.666
- I'm so happy that you guys
decided on this, like, classic,

10:24.708 --> 10:27.168
beautiful, elegant--
I don't know.

10:27.210 --> 10:30.755
I feel like today,
some brides try and go

10:30.797 --> 10:33.008
so avant-garde and sexy.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.426
And I feel like,
on your wedding day,

10:34.467 --> 10:35.552
you want to be just like...

10:35.593 --> 10:36.553
- Well, it's gonna
last forever, right?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.346
- Timeless, elegant.
Yeah.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.182
<i>[gentle music]</i>

10:41.224 --> 10:42.684
<i>- When people found out</i>
<i>I was getting married,</i>

10:42.726 --> 10:45.020
<i>I had designers from all</i>
<i>around the world reaching out</i>

10:45.061 --> 10:46.730
<i>to make me my wedding dress.</i>

10:46.771 --> 10:48.648
<i>There is even some designers</i>
<i>that were offering,</i>

10:48.690 --> 10:50.775
<i>like, six figures for me</i>
<i>to wear their design.</i>

10:50.817 --> 10:53.194
<i>But in the end, I wanted</i>
<i>something that was beautiful,</i>

10:53.236 --> 10:56.489
<i>timeless, elegant,</i>
<i>chic, and iconic.</i>

10:56.531 --> 10:59.200
- How long does a dress
take to make?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.703
- To--to be safe,
good two to three months.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.038
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.623
- When is the wedding?
- I don't know yet.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.543
I'm trying to figure it out.
It's just hard because--

11:08.585 --> 11:10.045
- Well, this is--

11:10.086 --> 11:11.713
- Because of COVID,
all of the weddings got pushed.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.757
So every amazing venue
is taken.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.009
- Yeah.
- I think, like, definitely

11:16.051 --> 11:17.552
before Christmas
and the holidays.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.429
- So this year?
- Yes.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.722
[laughter]

11:20.764 --> 11:22.140
- I'm leaving.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.558
[laughter]

11:23.600 --> 11:24.976
I'm not.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.561
<i>- I care way more</i>
<i>about fashion</i>

11:26.603 --> 11:28.021
<i>than all the boring details.</i>

11:28.063 --> 11:31.024
I have no guest list, no venue.

11:31.066 --> 11:34.569
I have no idea where,
even what state or country

11:34.611 --> 11:35.737
I'm doing my wedding in.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.531
But at least
I'm gonna look good.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.658
But I love the princess vibes.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.702
But I feel like the legs
should be more see-through.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.079
- Okay.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.872
- Like, I think that's sexy
when you can see.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.749
- This is meant
to be nude organza.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.250
So you're gonna be sexy.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.503
- Definitely don't need
any nip slips.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.921
- No nip slips.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.673
- All right,
on to the next one.

11:54.714 --> 11:55.882
I love this, though.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.133
- All right, let's try
the second dress.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.594
- Yes.
- [laughs]

11:59.636 --> 12:01.054
Cute.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.765
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

12:03.807 --> 12:05.225
Oh, God.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.851
What did you do to my dress?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.479
[laughter]

12:09.521 --> 12:11.231
- Parisized it.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.066
- Oh, my God,
the little bow in the back.

12:13.108 --> 12:14.609
- What do you guys
think honestly?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.653
I think it looks hot.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.154
- It's actually cute.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.949
- Nicky, do you not like this?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.201
- The tan's throwing me off.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.537
- Does it look bad?
- No. It's just very orange.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.913
- I did it myself.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.791
- You need to make me
one promise.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.210
No spray tan the wedding week.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.628
- Ugh!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.797
- Look at Marilyn Monroe
and all those beautiful women.

12:35.839 --> 12:37.048
They weren't orange.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.551
- Because there was
no spray tans back then.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.969
- Valid point.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.096
However, there's actually
a little writing

12:43.138 --> 12:44.556
in the labels that say,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.391
"If you wear a spray tan
for an Oscar de la Renta dress,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.226
we will never
sell you another one."

12:49.811 --> 12:51.855
No, I'm kidding. Come on!

12:51.896 --> 12:53.023
It's gonna become, like,

12:53.064 --> 12:54.232
a beige dress
by the end of fitting.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.942
- Can you take
a picture of her

12:55.984 --> 12:57.277
on your phone
and just show her?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.445
- What?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.196
- I'm not gonna get
involved in this.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.990
<i>- I'm strict with her.</i>

13:02.032 --> 13:05.243
She's got a lot of yespeople
around her.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.622
And I will always tell her
straight how it is.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.416
And I think it humbles you.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.126
- I'm very humble.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.506
Mom is being so disorganized.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.675
She's literally, like,
trying to plan the wedding.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.926
It's, like--

13:21.968 --> 13:25.055
- Well, you guys both
are a disaster.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.931
It's the blind
leading the blind.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.517
- My mom and I,
we're not planners.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.186
We like to do things
last minute,

13:31.227 --> 13:34.022
and we like to focus
on what we like,

13:34.064 --> 13:36.316
which is beautiful dresses,

13:36.358 --> 13:40.111
flowers, and what gifts
I'm gonna get.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.573
- Mom's calling. Hi, Mom.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.367
- Hi.
- Hi, Mom.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.829
- I am in love with this.
It's so beautiful.

13:49.871 --> 13:53.416
- Thank you.
- It's just so precious.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.293
- Loves it.
- I'm in love with this.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.212
<i>How many looks are you doing?</i>

13:57.253 --> 13:59.923
- I'm doing 11 outfit changes.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.216
<i>- [laughs]</i>
- What?

14:01.257 --> 14:04.886
- I'm doing 11 outfit changes.
No, I'm kidding.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.513
- Every 15 minutes.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.723
[laughter]

14:08.765 --> 14:10.183
<i>When would you want</i>
<i>to do your shoes?</i>

14:10.225 --> 14:12.811
- Well, I have lots of looks,
so I need lots of shoes.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.729
<i>- Of course you do.</i>

14:14.771 --> 14:15.814
- What do you think?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.232
- They need a date.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.859
You guys are planning
shoes and veils and bags

14:19.901 --> 14:21.403
and there's no date.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.446
I feel like I'm gonna
have to plan this wedding.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.489
- You do.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.282
<i>- Have we nailed</i>
<i>anything down?</i>

14:26.324 --> 14:27.450
<i>A venue?</i>

14:27.492 --> 14:29.452
- No venue.
I don't--I don't know where.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.663
- Greystone Manor?
- Um.

14:31.705 --> 14:37.085
- But the Greystone Manor,
it is haunted, for sure.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.337
- Let's not do it there.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.505
- We have to get the show
on the road.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.591
- I know.
Help me plan something, dear.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.553
- Dear, but you're
never around to talk to.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.930
<i>You know, I need to be kept</i>
<i>in the loop a little bit.</i>

14:48.972 --> 14:50.849
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, love you guys.</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:51.850
- Love you.
- Love you too.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.227
- Bye.
- Bye. We love you.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.770
- She's a character.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.689
[laughter]

15:01.901 --> 15:03.820
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

15:03.862 --> 15:09.284
<i>- * Everywhere, everywhere</i>
<i>everywhere *</i>

15:09.325 --> 15:12.120
<i>* Feels like Paris with you *</i>

15:13.872 --> 15:15.749
- Makes me sad
that you live in New York.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.292
- I know.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.377
- I miss the old days when we
used to, like, live together

15:19.419 --> 15:22.172
and, like,
be together every second.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.423
- Those were the days.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.259
- I know. All grown up.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.552
I know I'm an adult,
but I, like,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.221
think of myself as a kid still.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.765
- I know. It's weird, right?

15:31.806 --> 15:34.225
- Is it weird having kids
and everything like--

15:34.267 --> 15:36.102
- They're in camp right now.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.562
- Oh, my God. Remember camp?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.856
Mom would make us go
to that camp and we hated it.

15:39.898 --> 15:43.151
So we'd write notes for, like,
the camp bus at the top, like,

15:43.193 --> 15:44.652
"Paris and Nicky are sick
today.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.821
They cannot come.
Kathy Hilton."

15:46.863 --> 15:48.740
- And then Mom and Dad
would be, like,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.408
"Why aren't you at camp?"

15:50.450 --> 15:51.910
And we'd be like,
"They didn't show up.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.328
They didn't pick us up."

15:53.370 --> 15:55.038
And they were too lazy
to drive us.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.456
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.498 --> 15:59.501
When you get back to LA,
get serious with planning

15:59.542 --> 16:03.171
or it's gonna be all rushed,
and it's not gonna happen.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.589
- Well.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.675
- Like, what do you want
to serve at your wedding?

16:06.716 --> 16:08.093
- I don't know.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.221
Mr. Chow, Taco Bell,
McDonald's.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.431
[both laugh]

16:13.473 --> 16:15.141
I'm really good
at throwing house parties.

16:15.183 --> 16:17.477
There's literally
no one better.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.603
But with planning a wedding,
there's just

16:18.645 --> 16:19.854
so much more that goes into it,

16:19.896 --> 16:23.441
and I don't know,
it's just overwhelming,

16:23.483 --> 16:27.737
and I'd rather focus
on things like my dress.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.949
What about a wedding
at the Playboy Mansion?

16:30.990 --> 16:31.950
- Is it still around?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.535
- Yeah.
- It is?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.620
I thought that they were
demolishing it and redoing it.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.457
- What? Demolished?
- Or no?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.084
- So many memories there.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.585
Remember we took
Mom there for Halloween?

16:42.627 --> 16:45.005
- Yes.
- French maid outfit.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.382
- Oh, my God.
[laughs]

16:47.424 --> 16:49.759
- That's just
typical Paris fashion.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.679
She's like a big kid.
She's unconventional.

16:52.721 --> 16:56.558
She's doing everything
backwards.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.810
- Trying to close
my dumb purse.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.187
I, like, break and destroy
every bag I own

17:01.229 --> 17:03.690
'cause I carry 3,000 things.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.233
- That is what you're
focusing on?

17:05.275 --> 17:06.526
- Yes.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.946
- Don't we have a bigger
situation at large?

17:09.988 --> 17:11.239
- Yeah. Good point.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.574
- Are you, like,
getting cold feet?

17:12.615 --> 17:14.534
Like, why is there no date?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.746
The date should be
the first thing

17:17.787 --> 17:19.956
and then you branch out
into everything.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.833
- I've been traveling.
My schedule's insane.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.418
Like, I can't even,
like--it's hard

17:23.460 --> 17:24.961
to even, like, think straight.

17:25.003 --> 17:28.673
Like, I just want it to, like,
appear and be, like, there.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.260
- But you have to take control.
This is your wedding.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.097
You have to, like,
be an adult and deal.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.684
Like, we're sitting here
eating,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.896
why don't you take out
your phone right now

17:42.937 --> 17:44.314
and text the planner

17:44.356 --> 17:46.483
about setting up a meeting
when you land?

17:47.817 --> 17:48.860
- [sighs]

17:48.902 --> 17:50.195
Breathe.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.865
- You can't rely on Mom
to do this.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.451
You need to do this.

17:56.493 --> 18:00.038
I feel like Paris
is dragging her heels.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.664
And I don't know why.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.876
Maybe it's 'cause she's been
used to this bachelorette life.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.171
<i>And in marriage, it's not</i>
<i>all about you anymore.</i>

18:08.213 --> 18:09.547
It's a partnership.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.257
Don't you want this
to be your dream day?

18:11.299 --> 18:14.260
- Yes.
That's why I need your help.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.137
- I'll help you.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.224
- Yeah, I feel like my wedding
needs to just be--

18:19.265 --> 18:20.934
- You.
- Me, which is--

18:20.975 --> 18:23.311
- Unapologetically you.

18:23.353 --> 18:24.270
- By the way,
I'm looking at you,

18:24.312 --> 18:26.231
you look so gorgeous.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.108
Your eyes are--you just--

18:28.149 --> 18:29.693
- Really?
- Yeah, it's weird.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.152
[phone ringing]
Who's that?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.445
both: Who's that?
- Mom?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.698
- I don't know.
But you look stunning.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.409
- Thank you. You too.
- Love you.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.286
4-4-2. No idea.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.663
I hate
when random people call me.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.164
I never answer

a break from work.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.787
I feel like I've been working
all weekend.

19:22.829 --> 19:26.166
- You work too hard.
- No, just hard enough.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.793
In the early days of us
dating, you'd say,

19:28.835 --> 19:31.629
"Oh, my God, it's so sexy.
You're always on your laptop."

19:31.671 --> 19:34.758
I was so scared that six
or nine months later,

19:34.799 --> 19:37.010
you were gonna get over it,
but you always would tell me

19:37.052 --> 19:38.762
you were gonna find it
sexy forever.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.097
- Yeah.
- And now all these many months

19:41.139 --> 19:43.391
later, you still do,
so I appreciate it.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.559
You're so incredibly
supportive.

19:44.601 --> 19:46.936
I love that about you.
- I love you.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.439
- But to be fair, you're always
on your laptop working too.

19:49.481 --> 19:50.815
- Yeah.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.734
- People don't realize
how hard you work.

19:52.776 --> 19:55.028
As you can imagine,
marrying Paris Hilton

19:55.070 --> 19:58.156
is quite different
than what I expected.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.949
- That's why I like just to do,
like,

19:59.991 --> 20:01.576
fun, kid things all the time.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.036
- Yeah, exactly.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.372
I grew up in a little town
of 1,000 people

20:05.413 --> 20:07.999
<i>called Wayne, Illinois,</i>
<i>about an hour outside Chicago.</i>

20:08.041 --> 20:11.836
<i>I grew up super private,</i>
<i>and so by design,</i>

20:11.878 --> 20:13.505
I like to kind of stay
out of the spotlight.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.590
I try to walk
behind the red carpet.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.259
I think we've only taken
one photo together

20:18.301 --> 20:20.804
ever on a red carpet.

20:20.845 --> 20:21.805
- If there was one
thing about me

20:21.846 --> 20:23.431
you could change,
what would it be?

20:23.473 --> 20:24.974
- Whoa, during the bike ride?

20:25.016 --> 20:26.434
I thought we were
just going to ride bikes.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.561
- I'm just asking.
- Uh.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.438
Okay, fine. One thing?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.732
- Yeah.
- No, never mind.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.110
- Tell me.
- No.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.987
Well, there's one thing.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.657
You're a little less organized
than I would like.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.742
I just blame
your creativity on that.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.829
- Well, life could be worse.
- It could be way worse.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.789
As I always tell people,
if you weren't messy,

20:47.831 --> 20:51.584
if there wasn't one small thing
not perfect about you,

20:51.626 --> 20:54.129
I wouldn't believe
you were true myself.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.172
- I feel the same way--
sometimes I get scared

20:56.214 --> 20:58.800
that you're too good
to be true, but--

20:58.842 --> 21:00.427
- What do we say? Custom made?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.012
- Oh, yeah.
- [chuckles]

21:02.053 --> 21:04.848
- We argue about what to watch
on TV every night,

21:04.889 --> 21:06.808
to be honest,
and it might seem trivial,

21:06.850 --> 21:08.768
but she loves rom-coms,

21:08.810 --> 21:11.354
which I do as well,
but she likes the sad rom-com,

21:11.396 --> 21:13.481
the ones where
the person's always dying.

21:13.523 --> 21:16.192
And I like the rom-coms
where the people are happy

21:16.234 --> 21:18.862
and they, you know, go off
into the sunset.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.572
- I don't like it
'cause they die.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.573
It just, like,
ends up happening

21:21.614 --> 21:23.158
in so many movies nowadays.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.035
- People want to know
you're real, Paris.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.370
Even unicorns
have disagreements.

21:27.412 --> 21:31.708
- No, they don't.
- No unicorn disagreements.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.293
So if you had to change
one thing about me,

21:33.335 --> 21:34.502
what would it be?

21:34.544 --> 21:36.880
- Hmm. Nothing.
- All right. Yeah.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.757
Okay, perfect. Okay.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.342
You pushed me to say one thing.

21:40.383 --> 21:43.803
So I'm gonna push you.
What's the one thing?

21:43.845 --> 21:46.681
- You're a little bossy.
- Bossy?

21:46.723 --> 21:47.932
- You get mad at me
when I'm late.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.560
- Yeah, that's for sure.
You deserve that.

21:50.602 --> 21:52.270
- Reminds me of my sister.
- Yeah.

21:52.312 --> 21:53.730
Your sister gives you
the tough love.

21:53.772 --> 21:54.606
You need tough love
in your life.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.149
- Yeah.

at the end of the day, I just
love Paris the person so much.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.117
And so for me,
it's an easy trade

22:06.159 --> 22:08.286
because I get to spend
the rest of my life with Paris.

22:08.328 --> 22:10.747
- Love you.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.123
- All right,
race you to the end?

22:12.165 --> 22:15.377
- Yeah.
- [mimics bike revving]

22:15.418 --> 22:18.088

where the--power--

22:24.094 --> 22:25.887

22:25.929 --> 22:28.348

- The side.

actors, rock stars,

23:59.481 --> 24:04.027

24:08.114 --> 24:10.450
He doesn't need my money.
He doesn't need my fame.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.743
He hates all of that.

24:11.785 --> 24:12.869
- Like your dad.
- He is.

24:12.911 --> 24:14.204

24:21.920 --> 24:23.296

you're always like,

24:26.257 --> 24:27.842
"We gotta find you someone
like your dad."

24:56.621 --> 24:58.248

- Yeah.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.041

love--

25:00.083 --> 25:01.668
- I'm so in love with him.
He's the perfect guy.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.170

So what--like, why not?

25:04.212 --> 25:05.463
Why isn't it happening?

25:07.549 --> 25:10.010
- When you think something
is too good to be true--

25:10.051 --> 25:11.553
like, I know he's true
and everything,

25:11.594 --> 25:12.804
but then--

25:14.639 --> 25:16.099
Because I've been [bleep] over

25:18.309 --> 25:21.646

- Is that--you're cool--
you're cool with it?

25:28.903 --> 25:30.280
Is that like--

25:30.321 --> 25:32.365
- It's new and different to me,

25:32.407 --> 25:34.659
but I feel like
I have to do it.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.870
Like, I want to have a family.
- You have to?

25:36.911 --> 25:37.829
- Yes.
I'm very old fashioned.

25:37.871 --> 25:39.539

25:39.581 --> 25:41.458
then have the babies, then--

25:41.499 --> 25:44.169
- You should say I want to.
- I want to, as well.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.420
- Okay.

25:45.462 --> 25:48.798
- It's only to do with me
being disorganized,

25:48.840 --> 25:50.842
my mom being the same way.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.929
- That's it?
- Yes. I'm very happy.

Like, I know, like,
he's the right one.

25:56.514 --> 25:58.475

I know, he's gonna be

father...

26:01.144 --> 26:02.645

- Partner.

- Hi!

26:56.074 --> 26:58.118

- Thank you.

26:58.159 --> 27:03.873

Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.254
- So sweet.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.340
- Put them on because
the dogs will love this.

27:12.382 --> 27:13.633

sounds better,

27:13.675 --> 27:16.344
Paris Whitney Hilton-Reum

27:16.386 --> 27:18.722

- No! Slivington!

27:35.447 --> 27:37.323
All right. Is she teething?

27:37.365 --> 27:38.742
Oh, my goodness.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.077
- She's gonna, like,
rip it apart.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.746
- Sorry, I don't want her
to rip them all.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.706
Oh, my goodness. No!

No, no, don't rip them.

Those are good boots.
No, no, Slivington.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.336
No, no!

27:49.377 --> 27:50.795
She's got to be trained
not to do that, Paris.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.130
Look at this one.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.256
- Well, usually, people are not

on their feet.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.634
- All right, then we have to--
you can't wear them around her.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.761
My dogs don't do that.

27:57.802 --> 28:00.680
- Well, your dogs
are not a husky.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.057
- All right.
No more, no more, no more.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.434
That's it.
[Slivington barks]

28:04.476 --> 28:05.935

28:05.977 --> 28:08.605

28:08.646 --> 28:09.898
- Almost two years.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.067
- Is it?
Oh, wow, yeah.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.694
- Carter and I celebrate
our anniversary every month.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.613
We call it our monthiversaries.

28:16.654 --> 28:19.282
And it's every month
on the 29th.

28:19.324 --> 28:23.536
- Oh, I find that
the monthly anniversary thing,

28:23.578 --> 28:26.915
I thought that she would--maybe
they'd do that for a few months

28:26.956 --> 28:28.416
or for the first six months.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.543
- Did you and dad
celebrate monthiversaries?

28:30.585 --> 28:31.795
- No.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.755
- So that's not normal?
- No.

28:33.797 --> 28:35.965
It went on and on and on.

28:36.007 --> 28:40.845
And, um,
whatever floats your boat.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.472
- We're gonna have,
like, a date tonight.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.307
- Very sweet.

28:44.349 --> 28:46.017
Crazy.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.395
Wait, excuse me.
- What?

28:49.938 --> 28:51.231
- This was my gift to Carter.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.899
- What?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.901
- This is a beautiful
Hermès tray

28:54.943 --> 28:56.486
that does not
belong in the kitchen

28:56.528 --> 28:58.321
with a bunch of candles.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.532
I thought he'd use that
in his office

29:00.573 --> 29:02.826
with, like, water, I mean--

29:02.867 --> 29:04.202
- Well, he didn't do this.
Someone else--

29:04.244 --> 29:06.037
- Who did this?
Does he know?

29:06.079 --> 29:07.414
I'll just take it back.

29:07.455 --> 29:10.291
- No, he loves it,
but he didn't know what to--

29:10.333 --> 29:12.210
I don't even know
what this stuff is.

29:12.252 --> 29:14.129
So what are we supposed
to do with it?

29:14.170 --> 29:15.422
- I think it should go
to the beach,

29:15.463 --> 29:17.173
and it shouldn't have
anything on it.

29:17.215 --> 29:18.925
- Oh.
- It's an Hermès tray.

29:18.967 --> 29:21.052
And they're really hard to get.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.887
- I'll put it here.
- No, Paris.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.097
- I don't know
where to put it.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.223
- He just doesn't
appreciate it.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.224
- No, he loves it!

29:26.266 --> 29:27.392
He just didn't--
he didn't do that.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.436

- For me?
- Of course.

30:03.845 --> 30:06.556
I love gifts.
I love sweet letters.

disappointed before,

32:35.497 --> 32:39.584

a little paranoid.

she has made the right choice.

"You are crazy."

35:59.325 --> 36:01.244
Do you know how gorgeous
you look tonight?

36:01.286 --> 36:03.913
- You're not so bad yourself.
- [chuckles]

36:03.955 --> 36:06.458
- The view. Oh, my God.

36:06.499 --> 36:08.084
- It's beautiful.

36:08.126 --> 36:09.711
<i>Definitely had</i>
<i>a lot of differences.</i>

36:09.753 --> 36:11.880
<i>But we're perfect</i>
<i>for each other.</i>

36:11.921 --> 36:14.883
We support each other.
We respect each other.

36:14.924 --> 36:17.302
We have so much fun together.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.804
Wow, look at this room.
It's so cool.

36:19.846 --> 36:21.556
- Beautiful.

36:21.598 --> 36:22.807
I used to have
a pink pool table

36:22.849 --> 36:25.310
right in the living room.
- Okay.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.812
One of the reasons
why Paris has been able

36:27.854 --> 36:30.231
to get as far as she had is,
she's tough.

36:30.273 --> 36:33.151
<i>She's obviously had a lot</i>
<i>of advantages in this world,</i>

36:33.193 --> 36:35.653
but she's also fought through
a lot of adversity.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.155
Nice.

36:37.197 --> 36:38.406
<i>And I think the way</i>
<i>she did that was,</i>

36:38.448 --> 36:41.076
<i>she put up walls</i>
<i>and she put up armor.</i>

36:41.117 --> 36:43.995
<i>She created this character</i>
<i>called Paris Hilton.</i>

36:44.037 --> 36:45.705
Oh, you didn't leave me
a whole lot.

36:45.747 --> 36:46.998
I gotta be honest.
- Yeah.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.124
I did that on purpose.

36:48.166 --> 36:49.626
- On our first date, I said,

36:49.668 --> 36:51.378
"I want to know
the real Paris."

36:51.419 --> 36:53.004
That made her uncomfortable,
right?

36:53.046 --> 36:54.881
Because she doesn't like
to let people in

36:54.923 --> 36:56.716
because that's
how she's protected herself

36:56.758 --> 36:58.093
for so long.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.804
Oh! It was close.
[both chuckle]

37:00.845 --> 37:03.181
<i>So I just keep saying,</i>
<i>"Look, we all have, you know,</i>

37:03.223 --> 37:06.309
"things that have been--
hurt us in the past.

37:06.351 --> 37:08.978
But let's not let our past
ruin our future."

37:09.020 --> 37:10.355
- I love these little stairs.

37:10.397 --> 37:13.400
We should build this
in one of our other houses.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.944
- They look dangerous, though.
- You're right.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.280
- So this is the library.

37:19.322 --> 37:22.534
Obviously,
you love Marilyn Monroe.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.369
I was told to figure it out.

37:24.411 --> 37:28.456
There's a bookshelf
that goes to secret passageway.

37:28.498 --> 37:32.377
Supposedly, JFK used
to have Marilyn Monroe

37:32.419 --> 37:35.422
sneak up the bookshelf.
Let's see if this does it.

37:38.091 --> 37:41.052
Okay, ready?
They don't make this easy.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.972
I don't know how Marilyn
got out of here.

37:44.014 --> 37:46.391
All right. Come check this out.

37:46.433 --> 37:47.892
Wow.

37:47.934 --> 37:52.689
Looks like they've locked it.
But the concept is strong.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.941
- This is amazing.
- Yeah.

37:54.983 --> 37:56.317
- Ever since I was
a little girl,

37:56.359 --> 37:59.029
I've always had this
fascination with Marilyn.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.448
<i>Just always thought</i>
<i>that she was beautiful</i>

38:01.489 --> 38:05.285
<i>and just loved the camera.</i>
<i>The camera loved her.</i>

38:05.326 --> 38:07.537
But she also had this sadness
in her eyes,

38:07.579 --> 38:11.416
and I could tell
that she was misunderstood.

38:11.458 --> 38:14.252
And I also think
that she was just like me.

38:14.294 --> 38:17.339
Not a dumb blonde but very good
at pretending to be one.

38:19.382 --> 38:20.800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:20.842 --> 38:23.261
- To how many more months?
- Billions.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.596
- All right!

38:24.637 --> 38:27.849
<i>- * I fell in love</i>
<i>under a gray sky *</i>

38:27.891 --> 38:29.476
- Ladies first.

38:29.517 --> 38:32.228
<i>- It takes a very strong</i>
<i>and secure man to date me.</i>

38:32.270 --> 38:35.815
Most of my past relationships,
they would feel emasculated,

38:35.857 --> 38:38.401
they would get jealous,
insecure.

38:38.443 --> 38:40.195
But Carter's
completely different.

38:40.236 --> 38:42.655
<i>- * I fell in love</i>
<i>under a gray sky *</i>

38:42.697 --> 38:43.948
- Look at that view.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.201
- Beautiful.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.119
- He's so secure
within himself,

38:48.161 --> 38:50.288
and he has success on his own.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.208
So he really doesn't need
anything from me but love.

38:53.249 --> 38:55.502
- Ooh.
- Love you, baby.

38:55.543 --> 38:58.213
- Happy 20 months.

38:58.254 --> 39:00.131
- These would be beautiful
for the wedding, these colors.

39:00.173 --> 39:02.467
I love the pastels.
- Yeah.

39:02.509 --> 39:07.889
All right, I am ready
for a cocktail and some food.

39:07.931 --> 39:10.684
- And, like, one of those
hot wet towels

39:10.725 --> 39:11.976
'cause I have pink lips on you.

39:12.018 --> 39:15.021
- Okay.
Let's see if this works.

39:15.063 --> 39:17.315
- Oh, wow.
You do have pink lips on me.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.525
[both laugh]

39:18.566 --> 39:19.901
- Told you.

39:19.943 --> 39:21.194
- I thought it was like
a little bit.

39:21.236 --> 39:22.320
- No.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.488
- It looks like
I'm wearing lipstick.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.990
- I told you.
- Is it still there?

39:26.032 --> 39:28.326
- Yes.
- Look at this napkin.

39:28.368 --> 39:29.828
- Well, then I probably
have none left.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.955
Thanks.

39:31.996 --> 39:33.289
- Jeez.

39:33.331 --> 39:35.208
- What made you think
of San Francisco?

39:35.250 --> 39:36.751
- I came across the history

39:36.793 --> 39:39.421
of the Fairmont Hotel,
the Marilyn connection.

39:39.462 --> 39:41.089
- Yes.
- Thought it was cute.

39:41.131 --> 39:43.174
- I can feel her vibes.
- Do you feel them?

39:43.216 --> 39:46.302
- I always feel them,
but I especially feel them.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.179
- What's the other famous
Marylin quote,

39:48.221 --> 39:49.556
something about shoes?

39:49.597 --> 39:51.141
- "Give a woman
the right pair of shoes

39:51.182 --> 39:53.893
and she can conquer the world."

39:53.935 --> 39:55.228
- Good evening.
- Hello.

39:55.270 --> 39:56.646
- Welcome to Fairmont
San Francisco.

39:56.688 --> 39:57.939
My name is Lindsey.

39:57.981 --> 39:58.898
I'll be serving you
this evening.

39:58.940 --> 40:00.358
- Cool.
Nice to meet you.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.609
- I'm gonna turn on
the heat lamps for you as well.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.028
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Perfect. Thank you.

40:03.069 --> 40:04.571
- Oh, I want her to take
a photo of us

40:04.612 --> 40:06.781
'cause we have never been to
San Francisco before together.

40:06.823 --> 40:09.993
- Oh, yeah, Lindsey,
could you take a photo for us?

40:11.411 --> 40:14.748
- One, two, three.
- I love you.

40:14.789 --> 40:16.207
- I love you.

40:16.249 --> 40:18.710
I'm luckiest guy
in the world, aren't I?

40:18.752 --> 40:20.378
- Yes.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.380
- You're supposed to say,
"I'm lucky too."

40:22.422 --> 40:24.132
Oh, my God.
- I'm lucky too.

40:24.174 --> 40:25.342
- Sorry, Lindsey.
I hope you got it.

40:25.383 --> 40:26.885
I hope you were taking a video.

40:26.926 --> 40:28.553
I fed that softball up to her.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.889
Let's try it again.
Maybe do this on video.

40:30.930 --> 40:32.140
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

40:32.182 --> 40:33.933
I feel like the luckiest guy
in the world.

40:33.975 --> 40:35.185
- You are.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.229
- I feel like I--
- And so am I.

40:38.271 --> 40:41.191
- Okay, I love it.
All right.

40:41.232 --> 40:44.235
- I was planning on starting
a family on my own

40:44.277 --> 40:46.738
and just being
one of those independent women

40:46.780 --> 40:48.907
who didn't need a man.

40:48.948 --> 40:50.158
<i>So I honestly thought</i>

40:50.200 --> 40:51.951
<i>that I was just gonna be</i>
<i>alone forever.</i>

40:51.993 --> 40:53.328
<i>And I was fine with it</i>

40:53.370 --> 40:55.997
because I had just been
through hell and back.

40:56.039 --> 41:00.627
I was sick of just being
lied to, cheated on,

41:00.669 --> 41:04.172
yelled at, hit,
just been through it all.

41:04.214 --> 41:07.926
And I just thought that,
"You know what?

41:07.967 --> 41:09.302
"Nice guys don't exist.

41:09.344 --> 41:12.972
And maybe I'm just meant
just to be with me."

41:13.014 --> 41:14.766
So cold.

41:14.808 --> 41:16.476
- You want a blanket?

41:16.518 --> 41:19.104
- But then when I met him,
everything changed,

41:19.145 --> 41:20.563
and all of that
went out the window.

41:20.605 --> 41:23.191
- Let's get you all bundled up.
- Thanks.

41:23.233 --> 41:24.401
<i>This was different</i>
<i>than anything</i>

41:24.442 --> 41:26.027
<i>that I've ever experienced.</i>

41:26.069 --> 41:28.446
I just felt like
I was back in high school.

41:28.488 --> 41:33.326
It was something I had not felt
in I don't even know how long.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.995
Even my mom,
so cute about you today.

41:36.037 --> 41:38.456
As I was about to leave
to go meet you,

41:38.498 --> 41:41.334
she just, like, literally
looked at me seriously

41:41.376 --> 41:43.461
and was like,
"Paris, I really believe

41:43.503 --> 41:47.132
"it was meant to be
and you deserve this.

41:47.173 --> 41:49.217
And you finally found
your fairy tale."

41:49.259 --> 41:52.429
- If anyone deserves
their fairy tale, it's you.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.639
- She's never liked
any of my boyfriends.

41:54.681 --> 41:58.852
Never like--I've never met
my boyfriend's families.

41:58.893 --> 42:00.145
Like, it's never
been like that.

42:00.186 --> 42:02.522
With you, after, like,
one month,

42:02.564 --> 42:06.317
I was in Michigan
with your entire family,

42:06.359 --> 42:09.654
and we've been like family
ever since.

42:09.696 --> 42:11.281
- I love it.

42:11.322 --> 42:12.449
<i>- This is all so new to me.</i>

42:12.490 --> 42:14.325
I'm so used to just, like,

42:14.367 --> 42:15.910
these superficial
relationships.

42:15.952 --> 42:20.665
So when it comes to talking
about actual emotions,

42:20.707 --> 42:24.836
it's something that
I've never really done before.

42:24.878 --> 42:26.421
What is this?

42:26.463 --> 42:33.261
[playing "I Blame You"
by Paris Hilton]

42:33.303 --> 42:35.805
- Do you recognize this song?

42:35.847 --> 42:38.350
- [laughs]
Yes.

42:38.391 --> 42:40.518
- You wrote this song
just for me.

42:40.560 --> 42:42.771
- Yeah.

42:42.812 --> 42:46.149
But with him, it's like
he just pulled that down,

42:46.191 --> 42:49.944
<i>and now I'm opening up in ways</i>
<i>that I never have before,</i>

42:49.986 --> 42:53.365
and it feels good just to feel
so close with someone.

42:53.406 --> 42:55.116
<i>* I feel good *</i>

42:55.158 --> 42:58.536
<i>* I feel good, I blame you *</i>

42:58.578 --> 43:00.372
- We are definitely gonna be
celebrating monthly

43:00.413 --> 43:01.623
for the rest of our lives.

43:01.664 --> 43:04.709
- Yes.
- It's kind of our thing.

43:04.751 --> 43:05.794
<i>Deal?</i>

43:05.835 --> 43:07.837
- Deal.
- Pinky swear?

43:07.879 --> 43:09.714
- Yes.
- Okay.

43:09.756 --> 43:11.883
Everyone saw it.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.843
- What are we doing
for the 21 monthiversary?

43:13.885 --> 43:15.136
- No. No, 21st--

43:15.178 --> 43:16.971
- 21 is a big deal.
- That's a big deal?

43:17.013 --> 43:18.306
- That's like...
- Really?

43:18.348 --> 43:20.809
- When you don't have to use
a fake ID anymore.

43:20.850 --> 43:23.103
- The next one that's a big one
is that one...

43:23.144 --> 43:24.771
- What?
- Our wedding.

43:24.813 --> 43:27.565
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

43:27.607 --> 43:31.361
<i>- * I feel good, I feel good *</i>

43:31.403 --> 43:35.365
<i>* I blame you, I blame you *</i>
