01:52.863 --> 01:55.366
There are three
tracking devices on this car.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.955
Get up close
behind that truck.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.309
That should do it.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.030
I hope you're not sore at me
for running off.

02:36.866 --> 02:39.493
It sure was stupid of me
to get caught up like I did.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.080
Thanks for getting me
out of there.

02:46.542 --> 02:48.002
How'd you do this?

02:49.044 --> 02:52.006
Darya told me what happened.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.008
You needed to get out, Ray.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.594
Where's Darya?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.388
She's waiting
for a phone call

02:59.513 --> 03:01.557
when we get someplace safe.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.310
Where are we going?

03:05.352 --> 03:09.023
You'd probably like to go
to that place they call "The Farm."

03:11.192 --> 03:13.277
That's what I was thinking.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.112
We're heading
in the right direction.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.614
I‒

03:16.739 --> 03:17.865
just saying.

03:19.742 --> 03:22.369
They're not gonna
let us just walk.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.954
Are they?

03:25.164 --> 03:27.708
They're bound to be
looking for us soon.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.877
You have something I want, Ray.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.549
Yes, I do.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.220
I got it memorized.

03:40.346 --> 03:44.266
All the numbers,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.227
memorized perfectly.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.566
But honestly, Mr. Cooper,

03:52.691 --> 03:55.402
I think it might
be worth some money.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.449
Maybe...
quite a lot of money.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.620
You think so, do you?

04:04.745 --> 04:07.289
Yes, sir, I do.

04:21.804 --> 04:23.847
There it is.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.725
Take that little road
up there on the right.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.895
Let's get off this highway, Ray.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.643
You mind if I
pull over a sec?

05:51.769 --> 05:53.187
I gotta take a leak.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.189
Go for it.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.075
Ray.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.827
I want that information.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.370
Yes?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.332
Looks like you're out
half a million.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.043
Well,

06:58.168 --> 07:00.963
I think you're wrong about that.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.218
Tricked ya, fucker.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.361
Phillip.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.570
It's Ray.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.530
Uh,

10:55.656 --> 10:57.783
I think he's dead,

10:57.908 --> 11:00.243
but he's found
some kind of help, so...

11:00.369 --> 11:02.037
I'm not 100 percent,

11:02.162 --> 11:04.081
and-I‒‒mm...

11:04.206 --> 11:06.166
I saw something in Cooper.

11:07.209 --> 11:09.670
It may be the key
to what this is all about.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.048
And I told him
where I'm going,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.050
so if he comes after me,
I'll get him there.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.775
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:31.900 --> 11:34.986
the Roadhouse

I did like that song.

43:17.053 --> 43:20.015
Oh, look.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.600
I found a penny.

43:23.393 --> 43:25.687
Oh.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.857
And it's heads up.

43:28.982 --> 43:31.109

town, don't you?

46:25.700 --> 46:26.993
Yes.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.289
You live by the school?

46:33.917 --> 46:35.919
How did you know that?

46:36.044 --> 46:37.420
I just do.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.098
So...

46:49.224 --> 46:51.976
I thought you were
going with Mary.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.229
No.

46:54.354 --> 46:55.939
No, that's over.

46:58.650 --> 46:59.901
Are you...

47:00.026 --> 47:02.195
sad about that?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.738
No.

47:05.031 --> 47:06.324
Oh.

47:07.951 --> 47:09.828
Okay, that's...

47:09.953 --> 47:11.788
that's good.
That's good.

47:11.913 --> 47:14.082
- That's‒that's good.
- Yeah.

47:24.968 --> 47:26.261
It was...

47:26.386 --> 47:29.472
really nice of you
to walk me home.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.349
I really wanted to.

47:32.809 --> 47:35.228
Do you mind
if I give you a kiss?

47:35.353 --> 47:37.355
I don't...

47:37.480 --> 47:40.149
I don't know,
I'm just...

Please, just...one?

47:57.166 --> 47:58.543
