ISABEL:
Come on, Elena. Hurry.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.250
What's the rush,
Isabel?

01:11.250 --> 01:13.500
Hey, Mateo, what are
you doing here?

01:13.500 --> 01:16.580
Isabel's showing me
the magic of science.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.380
Okay, Mateo,
do the globe thing.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.380
So, as you know,

01:20.380 --> 01:23.880
today there's going to be
a total solar eclipse.
Mateo.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.330
That's when the moon
completely blocks the sun.

01:27.330 --> 01:30.170
Now everyone at the festival
will want to watch the eclipse,

01:30.170 --> 01:33.580
but looking directly
at the sun hurts your eyes.

01:33.580 --> 01:35.830
So I invented this.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.790
Oh. It looks like
a telescope.

01:37.790 --> 01:40.080
It was, but I turned it
into a solar projector.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.710
Look!

01:41.710 --> 01:44.290
So we can safely watch
the eclipse on a wall.

01:44.290 --> 01:46.000
There you all are.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.250
Uh, it's time to go to the park
for the Eclipse Festival.

01:49.250 --> 01:50.750
What's that?

01:50.750 --> 01:53.000
It's just an image
of the sun. See?

01:53.000 --> 01:55.750
Oh, good.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.080
I can't wait for
the eclipse to be over.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.790
Why? A total solar eclipse
only comes to Avalor

02:00.790 --> 02:03.620
once every 200 to 300 years.

02:03.620 --> 02:05.290
We're lucky
we get to see it.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.540
Not if Orizaba
shows up.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.750
Who exactly is Orizaba?

02:09.750 --> 02:14.170
Long ago, there was
a moth fairy named Orizaba.

02:14.170 --> 02:17.750
She lived in the shadows
until, one day,

02:17.750 --> 02:21.040
she tried to bring
eternal darkness to Avalor.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.920
A Maruvian wizard stopped her

02:22.920 --> 02:25.580
and sent her to
the spirit world.

02:25.580 --> 02:29.460
But it is said she found a way
to return to Avalor

02:29.460 --> 02:34.040
every solar eclipse so she can
fulfill her dark plans.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.250
Armando, you are
the best storyteller

02:41.250 --> 02:43.500
in all of Avalor.

02:46.710 --> 02:48.920
Come on. Let's get dressed
for the festival, Isabel.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.250
Armando.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.000
It's just a story.
We'll be fine.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.040
Okay.

02:56.040 --> 02:59.290
Now all I need
is the royal scepter.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.920
That's so... Ow!

03:03.920 --> 03:05.540
Blazes!

03:05.540 --> 03:08.790
What was that?

03:08.790 --> 03:11.710
Zuzo! Zuzo!

03:11.710 --> 03:13.750
Hey, princess.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.420
Whoa! You must've had
some fiesta.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.080
I didn't have a party.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.040
It was my scepter.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.880
Oh, sure,
blame the equipment.

03:21.880 --> 03:25.540
Zuzo, a beam of light
shot out of the scepter,

03:25.540 --> 03:27.830
and blasted the footstool.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.380
Oh. I didn't know
it could do that.

03:30.380 --> 03:33.330
Neither did I.
That's why I called you.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.710
All right,
Zuzo is on the job.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.040
Now, tell me exactly
what happened.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.670
Okay. I picked up
the scepter, and it glowed,

03:40.670 --> 03:42.120
like it does every time
I pick it up,

03:42.120 --> 03:43.750
which is weird,
by the way,

03:43.750 --> 03:45.880
'cause it never did that
when my father was king.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.330
And then, I tripped on
the footstool and, bam!

03:48.330 --> 03:50.330
Hm. That's it?

03:50.330 --> 03:53.710
You didn't leave any tiny
little itty bitty detail out?

03:53.710 --> 03:56.290
Well, when I tripped on
the stool, I said "blazes."

04:00.750 --> 04:03.290
Drop it, and step away
from the scepter.

04:04.790 --> 04:07.210
And do not say "blaze."

04:07.210 --> 04:10.580
- I don't know.

04:10.580 --> 04:14.290
Let's see. It does look
kind of Maruvian.

04:14.290 --> 04:16.790
But it's
the scepter of Avalor.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.750
Well, it is now,

04:18.750 --> 04:21.920
but the kingdom of Maru
was here long before Avalor,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.380
and those Maruvians made
a bunch of magical objects.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.040
Really?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.460
Oh, yeah. So maybe your
scepter is magical, too.

04:28.460 --> 04:31.750
You know what? I'm gonna
run this by a few friends
in the spirit world.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.750
- Okay, I have some info.
- That was fast.

04:34.750 --> 04:38.500
All right. It turns out your
scepter is definitely Maruvian.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.830
- No, not on its own.

04:40.830 --> 04:43.670
The scepter is channeling
the magic inside you.

04:43.670 --> 04:45.170
The magic you got from
being in the amulet so long.

04:45.170 --> 04:48.750
Wait. You're saying
I have the power

04:48.750 --> 04:51.380
to destroy things
with a single word?

04:51.380 --> 04:53.580
It's lookin' that way.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.830
But we don't know exactly
how it all works yet.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.880
Now, I'm gonna try and find out,
but until I do,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.920
I think it's best if you
don't touch the scepter again.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.790
Sound good

05:02.790 --> 05:05.120
But I need it for
the Eclipse Festival.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.540
Yeah, and what happens if
you say the wrong word,

05:08.540 --> 05:10.750
and the Eclipse Festival
turns out like your footstool?

05:10.750 --> 05:12.790
Ooh. Good point.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.790
Right? I'll be back in
two shakes of a spirit tail.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.880
Great. Of all the scepters
in the world,

05:19.880 --> 05:22.290
I get the one
that blasts things.

05:22.290 --> 05:24.210
Why couldn't it
just be sparkly?

05:32.330 --> 05:34.880
The eclipse is almost total.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.960
Looks like it's time
to give my speech.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.920
My fellow Avalorans.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.290
Princess Elena,
you forgot your scepter.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.170
Oh, um...

05:47.170 --> 05:50.710
thanks, Armando.

05:52.790 --> 05:55.580
Okay, please don't
do anything bad.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.960
My fellow Avalorans.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.960
It has been 250 years--

06:00.960 --> 06:02.880
Fifty-two years.

06:02.880 --> 06:08.790
252 years since the last total
solar eclipse in Avalor.

06:08.790 --> 06:12.880
So I am honored to spend
this once-in-a-lifetime occasion

06:12.880 --> 06:14.790
with you and your families.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.830
Like these torches,
the spirit of Avalor

06:17.830 --> 06:20.710
always blaz...

06:20.710 --> 06:22.540
um, always burns bright.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.080
Hello, Avalor!

06:36.080 --> 06:39.750
The one and only
Lady O. is back.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.500
What is that?

06:41.500 --> 06:43.880
It's... it's... Orizaba!

06:43.880 --> 06:45.880
That's right.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.080
Everyone's favorite
moth fairy has returned

06:49.080 --> 06:51.290
to make your
darkest dreams come true.

06:51.290 --> 06:52.380
She's real?!

06:52.380 --> 06:53.920
You bet I'm real.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.540
Stay away from
my sister.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.460
And who are you, dearie?

06:57.460 --> 06:59.920
Elena Castillo Flores.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.790
I'm the crown princess.

07:01.790 --> 07:04.830
Well, Elena Castillo Flores,

07:04.830 --> 07:07.710
thank you for throwing me
this fabulous party.

07:07.710 --> 07:09.750
Although I must say,

07:09.750 --> 07:13.170
it's the least you can do
since I am about to give you

07:13.170 --> 07:15.540
the greatest gift of all.

07:15.540 --> 07:18.830

08:11.170 --> 08:13.420
The Eye of Midnight.

08:13.420 --> 08:15.380
Those pesky Maruvians
hid it from me

08:15.380 --> 08:17.250
in one of their temples.

08:17.250 --> 08:19.960
Last visit, I couldn't find it,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.830
Okay. Everything's
going to be all right.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.920
There's no need
to panic.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
Run for your lives!

09:21.920 --> 09:23.670
Armando!

09:23.670 --> 09:25.670
What else do you know
about Orizaba?

09:25.670 --> 09:27.290
Is there any way to stop her?

09:27.290 --> 09:30.880
The story says
if she can't find the jewel

09:30.880 --> 09:34.380
before the eclipse ends, she
goes back to the spirit world.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.790
That only gives her
ten minutes.

09:35.790 --> 09:38.170
We can't just
wait and hope
she doesn't find it.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.000
You're right, Gabe.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.120
Mateo, do you have
any spells that can
slow her down?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.920
I think so.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.420
- Great. Then go after her.
- But she was heading north.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.830
There are only
two temples in that direction.

09:48.830 --> 09:50.290
- I'll check them out.
- You can take Fuego.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.210
I'm not all that good
at riding horses.

09:55.210 --> 09:58.710
It's easy. All you have
to do is not fall off.

09:58.710 --> 10:00.290
Oh! Is that all?

10:00.290 --> 10:02.670
Oh!

10:02.670 --> 10:04.540
Don't worry, Elena.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.500
I'll take care of
Orizaba.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.920
Go, Fuego!

10:11.580 --> 10:14.290
Assemble more guards
in case she comes back.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.790
We can't let her put
that jewel in the sun stone.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.330
Your Majesty,
Orizaba's very powerful.

10:19.330 --> 10:22.500
Well, Mateo has gone up
against powerful magic before.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
But nothing like
Orizaba.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.250
Armando, take Isabel
back to the palace.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.880
But what about
you, Elena?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.250
I'll meet you there.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.790
Sorry, Zuzo.
I have no choice.

10:35.790 --> 10:37.540
I need to use the scepter.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.750
We have to hurry, Canela.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.040
Follow!

10:42.790 --> 10:45.710
Well, this is the only
temple I haven't checked.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.880
The eye must be in here.

10:53.710 --> 10:56.920
Ugh. Could there be
more chambers in this place?

10:56.920 --> 10:59.830
I better get moving.
Time's running out.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.080
Not in here.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.830
Oh, Fuego, stop.

11:10.830 --> 11:12.750
Come on, slow down.
Stop!

11:16.380 --> 11:18.040
She's here.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.710
Okay.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.710
You can do this.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.330
Talact!

11:35.040 --> 11:36.250
Gotcha!

11:37.580 --> 11:39.670
Elena?!
Oh, um...

11:39.670 --> 11:40.960
Zanamo!

11:42.710 --> 11:44.120
Mateo?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.460
What are you doing here?
It's not safe.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.920
I know, but Orizaba
is really powerful,

11:49.920 --> 11:53.920
and it turns out that this
is a magical Maruvian scepter.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.210
Really? Wait.
We can talk about this later.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.920
Right now,
you have to go.

11:58.920 --> 12:00.920
- Too late.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.540
Quick, hide in here.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.500
What's the plan?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.920
You stay hidden.
I'm gonna take her
by surprise.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.540
- But...
- Sh!

12:14.540 --> 12:15.710
Ugh, this is
the last chamber.

12:15.710 --> 12:17.710
The eye
better be here.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.290
Why can't I blast it?

12:21.290 --> 12:23.460
Whatever happens,
stay here.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.880
Talact!

12:25.880 --> 12:29.830
Nice try, dearie,
but you talk too much.

12:31.170 --> 12:34.250
- Mateo!

12:34.250 --> 12:35.960
Blaze!

12:37.710 --> 12:39.460
Elena!

12:39.460 --> 12:41.880
My wing!

12:41.880 --> 12:44.880
Oh, it's just a scratch.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.880
But that sure isn't.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.620
Thank you, dearie.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.880
Are you okay?

12:51.880 --> 12:53.830
I'm just a little dizzy.

12:53.830 --> 12:55.710
Is that a piece
of her wing?

12:56.710 --> 12:58.920
It won't come off.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.830
Finally.
The Eye of Midnight.

13:00.830 --> 13:04.500
You know, if it wasn't for
your little magic scepter there,

13:04.500 --> 13:06.000
I might never have
gotten it out.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.710
Now let's get you
to the sun stone.

13:11.710 --> 13:14.290
No! We have to go
after her.

13:14.290 --> 13:17.790
Whoa. We better go
back to the palace.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.710
Stay sharp, men.
Only a minute left.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.580
There she is!
Bring her down, men.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.120
No, no, no.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.750
That any way to treat
your guest of honor?

13:40.960 --> 13:45.670
Let the eternal
evening begin!

13:45.670 --> 13:47.250
Friends of darkness,

13:47.250 --> 13:49.830
we no longer
have to live our lives

13:49.830 --> 13:51.830
hiding in the shadows.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.460
Come out,
wherever you are.

13:57.330 --> 14:00.710
Let's make ourselves
at home.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.920
The eclipse should be
over by now.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.960
Oh, no.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.830
She did it.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.290
Here. Sit.

14:14.290 --> 14:16.210
Zuzo was right.

14:16.210 --> 14:19.000
I never should've tried
to use the scepter.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.920
Avalor will never
see the sun again.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.750
You don't know that.

14:22.750 --> 14:25.210
And first, we have
to figure out what's
going on with you.

14:25.210 --> 14:26.790
I'm fine now.

14:26.790 --> 14:28.460
You don't seem fine.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.460
Using that scepter
did something to you.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.830
I remember seeing a chapter
in the Codex Maru

14:32.830 --> 14:34.880
about old magical objects.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.500
Whoa.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.880
- Your scepter's really old.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.920
It used to be called
the Scepter of Light.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.920
Listen to this.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.710
"The scepter can control
the powers of light,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.670
both the seen and unseen,

14:47.670 --> 14:49.460
with a single thought
put into words."

14:49.460 --> 14:51.920
What thoughts,
what words?

14:51.920 --> 14:54.290
It doesn't say,
but there is a warning.

14:54.290 --> 14:57.540
It says the more power you use,
the more you lose.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.880
What does that mean?

14:58.880 --> 15:00.920
I don't know,

15:00.920 --> 15:03.080
but I have an idea
how to find out.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.380
I'm gonna summon Zoo.

15:04.380 --> 15:08.790
Illuminara Alacazar Wayohel!

15:12.710 --> 15:15.750
Oh, hey, guys. I was just about
to come find you.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.750
I spoke to the spirit guide
who used to hang
with the Maruvians,

15:18.750 --> 15:22.210
and he said the scepter
saps your energy big time.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.330
Like, if you use it too much,
you could get hurt.

15:25.710 --> 15:29.420
Oh, I'm getting the feeling
you already figured this out.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.920
Yeah, I used the scepter.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.120
I thought we agreed
you wouldn't use it

15:34.120 --> 15:35.330
until we figured out
how to use it.

15:35.330 --> 15:37.460
I know, but Orizaba...

15:37.460 --> 15:39.380
Hold up.
Orizaba?

15:39.380 --> 15:41.120
The moth fairy?

15:41.120 --> 15:43.170
Oh, today's
the eclipse, isn't it?

15:43.170 --> 15:44.920
I knew there was
something I was forgetting.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.920
- Zuzo.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.920
She got the Eye of Midnight.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.580
She froze the eclipse.
What are we gonna do?

15:51.580 --> 15:54.920
Oh, okay, First, we're
gonna start with a few
cleansing breaths.

15:56.710 --> 15:58.330
Feels good, doesn't it?

15:58.330 --> 16:01.580
Now slowly, gently,
get used to living

16:01.580 --> 16:03.920
in a world of total darkness.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.670
!
- Oh, it's not so bad.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.790
Just think of it as
a nonstop slumber party.

16:08.790 --> 16:11.830
There's gotta be some way
to undo it.

16:11.830 --> 16:13.920
A spell,
some kind of magic.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.080
Well, I mean,
there is the, uh...

16:17.080 --> 16:18.620
you know...

16:18.620 --> 16:20.830
You want me to use
the scepter again?

16:20.830 --> 16:22.750
He's right, Elena.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.120
You saw how powerful
it was at the temple.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.380
But I don't know
how to use it.

16:26.380 --> 16:29.380
I might've picked up
a few pointers while
I was asking around.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.620
And you said
I could get hurt.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.170
I sure did,
and you sure could.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.210
Then that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.880
Elena, look at your dress.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.580
It's that piece of
Orizaba's wing.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.750
The light from the scepter
was doing something to it.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.880
It was sending it back
to the spirit world.

16:54.880 --> 16:59.500
It takes a magical light
to undo magical darkness.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.790
Make the scepter glow again.

17:01.790 --> 17:03.670
I don't know how.

17:03.670 --> 17:05.790
You can probably
put it down and pick it up,

17:05.790 --> 17:07.750
and put it down
and pick it up again,
and repeat as necessary.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.750
No. If I'm gonna learn
how to use this thing,

17:09.750 --> 17:11.920
I might as well start now.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.330
According to the Codex,
I just need to concentrate

17:14.330 --> 17:17.120
- and say the word.
- Sounds good.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.540
But maybe you should hide
behind something, Mateo.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.750
Okay.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.830
Glow.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.080
Glow!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.620
Oh...

17:36.620 --> 17:39.080
- It's gone.
- Right.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.330
If the scepter
got rid of her wing,

17:41.330 --> 17:44.540
it could get rid
of the rest of her,
if you're up to it.

17:44.540 --> 17:47.080
I will be.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.380
- Wait!

17:50.380 --> 17:52.040
To get rid of Orizaba.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.330
I hope.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.500
It's too dangerous.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.080
Don't worry.
I'll protect her.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.330
Thank you, my pets.

18:05.330 --> 18:08.750
Every queen
needs a throne.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.580
Hello again, princess.

18:11.580 --> 18:14.960
I'm just making myself at home,
since this is my new home.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.670
What do you think?

18:16.670 --> 18:18.120
Well, to be
perfectly honest,

18:18.120 --> 18:19.710
I prefer a little more light.

18:19.710 --> 18:22.210
Well, it's
too late for that, dearie.

18:24.330 --> 18:26.580
Glow.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.790
What are you doing?

18:28.790 --> 18:30.120
Glow!

18:31.580 --> 18:33.540
No!

18:37.120 --> 18:38.290
Glow!

18:40.080 --> 18:42.710
No. My wings.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.790
Are you okay?

18:45.790 --> 18:47.790
I will be
when she's gone.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.170
Elena, quick,
get in the coach.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.830
No, no. Move the coach.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.710
Oh, glorious shade.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.920
Orizaba's getting away.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.040
Elena!

19:07.540 --> 19:10.040
My powers are returning.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.920
Huh? Oh!

19:16.460 --> 19:17.830
What's wrong?

19:24.830 --> 19:27.210
Elena!

19:27.210 --> 19:28.580
She's got Isabel.

19:28.580 --> 19:29.710
Glow!

19:32.170 --> 19:33.540
Glow!

19:33.540 --> 19:34.960
Make it stop.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.000
Glow!

19:51.000 --> 19:52.880
It worked.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.170
Whoa...

19:56.170 --> 19:58.000
Elena, are you okay?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I am now.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.540
I just need to rest
a little bit.

20:11.750 --> 20:13.380
She's awake!

20:14.880 --> 20:17.710
Do you want us to close
the curtains, mija?

20:17.710 --> 20:20.540
No, that's okay.
The sunlight feels good.

20:20.540 --> 20:24.330
Let everyone know
Elena is awake.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.540
Wait. How long
have I been asleep?

20:29.540 --> 20:30.750
Two days.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.500
!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.960
I feel... fine.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.120
Elena, how'd you make
your scepter glow like that?

20:42.120 --> 20:45.250
Yes. Since when did you
become a wizard?

20:45.250 --> 20:47.540
I'm not a wizard, abuelo.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.920
But I do have
a bit of magic in me

20:49.920 --> 20:51.830
from being trapped in
that amulet all those years,

20:51.830 --> 20:54.380
and the scepter
can channel that magic.

20:54.380 --> 20:59.750
My granddaughter,
a magical princess.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.620
Do you have
other powers?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.920
Can we, um,
talk about it later?

21:03.920 --> 21:06.920
Right now, I can really
use some more rest.

21:06.920 --> 21:09.580
You heard her.
Everyone out.

21:09.580 --> 21:11.460
I was so worried.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.250
I'm okay now.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.750
Mateo, can you
stay a minute?

21:19.920 --> 21:21.710
What is it?

21:21.710 --> 21:23.750
Thank you...

21:23.750 --> 21:26.170
for helping me
figure this all out.

21:26.170 --> 21:27.710
I'm the royal wizard.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.170
That's my job.

21:29.170 --> 21:30.880
And carrying me
back to the palace.

21:30.880 --> 21:32.290
Well...

21:32.290 --> 21:35.580
You're so much more than
the royal wizard, Mateo.

21:35.580 --> 21:36.790
You're my friend.

21:36.790 --> 21:39.460
Oh...

21:39.460 --> 21:41.330
Yeah, I am.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.750
And I'm gonna
need your help.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.920
We have to figure out
everything the Scepter
of Light can do,

21:45.920 --> 21:48.210
and how I can use it
without passing out
for two days.

21:48.210 --> 21:51.460
And I'll need
Zuzo's help, too.

21:51.460 --> 21:54.330
Of course, princess.
That's what
spirit guides do.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.210
And I promise,

21:56.210 --> 21:59.000
I won't use it again until
I know exactly what I'm doing.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.670
Look at us.

22:01.670 --> 22:04.670
We're like
a magical dream team.
