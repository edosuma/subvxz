00:01.569 --> 00:03.008
LINDSAY:
Previously on The Practice...

00:03.008 --> 00:05.593
-I may have to set
the nun killer free.
-What?

00:05.593 --> 00:06.939
Warrantless search.

00:06.973 --> 00:10.110
-Stupid police mistake.
-Oh, God.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.746
Maybe I should
just look the other way.

00:12.779 --> 00:16.617
The police were required to have
a warrant to search that closet.

00:16.650 --> 00:17.751
They didn't get that warrant.

00:17.784 --> 00:21.354
As a result, everything in
that closet is inadmissible.

00:21.387 --> 00:23.957
HELEN: If a convicted felon
locks up a woman,

00:23.990 --> 00:26.392
reason says those
police officers

00:26.426 --> 00:28.161
should go in and investigate.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.897
The search of the closet
was illegal.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.867
The contents are inadmissible.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.502
He is free to go.

00:38.204 --> 00:42.442
Tell me, Jimmy,
do you typically toast victory
with all your clients?

00:42.475 --> 00:46.079
Or did all that
sex talk make you curious?

00:46.112 --> 00:48.982
LINDSAY: "Attorney James Berluti
has been making a little
chamber music

00:49.015 --> 00:50.751
with Judge
Roberta Kittleson."

00:50.784 --> 00:52.786
What? That--That's ridiculous.

00:55.822 --> 00:58.191
Jimmy, in my office.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.798
-LINDSAY:
I'm leaving any second.
-HELEN (on phone): <i>When?</i>

01:04.831 --> 01:06.266
As soon as Bobby gets here.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.968
Would it be so terrible if you
had your blind date without us?

01:08.001 --> 01:09.903
-Yes!
-All right.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.105
He should have been here
a half-hour ago.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.107
I think he's here now. Bobby!

01:14.140 --> 01:16.577
-Hurry up.
-Good-bye.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.914
Bobby, you're late.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.149
Helen's mad at me now because--

01:27.521 --> 01:29.189
Bobby.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.605
(sighs)

01:46.773 --> 01:48.141
(thud)

01:50.777 --> 01:52.445
Bobby.

01:52.478 --> 01:53.714
Funny.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.824
It's not funny.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.728
(sighs)

02:11.665 --> 02:13.166
(gasps, shouts)

02:13.667 --> 02:15.502
(gasping)

02:29.049 --> 02:31.685
(theme music playing)

02:40.293 --> 02:41.695
(phone ringing)

02:49.235 --> 02:51.772
(gate locks)

02:56.877 --> 02:59.479
(siren wailing)

03:16.062 --> 03:17.831
(phone rings)

03:17.864 --> 03:20.000
<i>LUCY: You've reached</i>
<i>the law offices of Donnell,</i>
<i>Young, Dole, and Frutt.</i>

03:20.033 --> 03:22.569
<i>Please leave a message,</i>
<i>and we'll get back to you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:22.603 --> 03:23.704
<i>(machine beeps)</i>

03:23.737 --> 03:26.072
<i>HELEN: Where the hell</i>
<i>are you guys?</i>

03:26.106 --> 03:28.975
<i>This guy's in the living room.</i>
<i>He ate all the guacamole.</i>

03:29.009 --> 03:30.410
He's as funny as a heart attack.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.813
<i>I'm dying here. I'm dying.</i>

03:33.947 --> 03:35.148
(groans)

03:35.181 --> 03:37.017
Lindsay, you here?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.184
(gasps)

03:38.218 --> 03:41.387
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.692
Lindsay.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.861
Lindsay.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.930
(groans)

03:52.065 --> 03:53.834
Nun.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.608
B.P. 60 palp. Pulse 130, weak.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.076
Neck veins are distended.
Get her into two!

04:03.109 --> 04:05.311
-Excuse me!
-Hold on, Lindsay! Hold on!

04:05.345 --> 04:06.713
Getting no pulse.
Are the paddles ready?

04:06.747 --> 04:08.782
Call the O. R.
Get me a chest tray.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.183
Her abdomen is rigid.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.652
MAN: One, two, three.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.719
Let's move it!

04:12.753 --> 04:15.589
She's in V-fib!
Charge the paddles. 200 joules.

04:15.622 --> 04:17.322
Clear!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.360
Got a pulse.
Normal sinus rhythm.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.028
Muffled heart sounds.
We may have a tamponade.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.264
-Give me a syringe.
-WOMAN: Here.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.438
-Get ready to crack the chest.
-Scalpel.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.318
-(woman on P. A.)
-(elevator bell dings)

04:46.720 --> 04:47.821
Where?

04:49.155 --> 04:51.758
-Still in surgery.
-Is she...

04:53.093 --> 04:54.561
I don't know anything.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.230
Oh, what happened?

04:57.263 --> 05:00.300
She said, "nun."

05:02.202 --> 05:03.236
Nun?

05:03.269 --> 05:05.839
She just looked at me,
and she s...

05:05.872 --> 05:07.708
and she said, "nun."

05:12.145 --> 05:13.714
The aorta was punctured.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.350
We think we've repaired it,
but the next 24 hours...

05:17.383 --> 05:18.652
we'll know.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.121
Know what?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.256
She went through
a lot of punishment.

05:23.289 --> 05:25.892
It's amazing that
she even made it here.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.130
-Where is she?
-She's in I. C. U.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.765
Can I see her?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.734
(sighs)

05:33.767 --> 05:35.569
Okay.

05:37.303 --> 05:39.540
(respirator whirring)

05:48.882 --> 05:50.350
Can--can she hear me?

05:50.383 --> 05:53.153
Mmm, it's possible,
but I want her to stay calm.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.822
You can tell her you're here.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.064
Lindsay... it's me, Bobby.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.933
Helen's-- Helen's with me, too.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.302
You just hold on.

06:09.335 --> 06:12.038
You're gonna be fine.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.107
You just-- you just hold on.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.980
We'll be right here
when you wake up.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.850
We'll be right here.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.597
(police radio chatter)

06:41.034 --> 06:43.537
That isn't evidence?

06:43.570 --> 06:45.071
They got all they needed.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.908
Eugene, Bobby's got
an arraignment this
morning on Watson,

06:47.941 --> 06:49.209
the carjacker murder.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.544
I'll do it.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.546
I'll get the file.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.928
-Excuse me.
-Sorry.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.700
No change, Bobby?

07:15.869 --> 07:17.037
No.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.641
You got the Watson file?

07:20.674 --> 07:23.510
Uh, Bobby,
I thought I'd take it.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.011
I can do it.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.913
Yeah, but do you think
under the circumstances--

07:26.947 --> 07:28.782
I'm fine.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.483
I can do it.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.091
Every nun that works
in that church--

07:38.124 --> 07:39.593
-bring them all in.
-Helen--

07:39.626 --> 07:42.095
-She said, "nun."
-Look, we don't know--

07:42.128 --> 07:44.330
Lindsay freed the nun killer.
Now she gets stabbed by a nun.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.701
I'm gonna play a hunch
and say it was somebody
that works in that church.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.836
Get every one of them
in here for questioning.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.471
Look, we could
question them there--

07:51.505 --> 07:53.439
I want them here.
I want it in our control.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.941
I want them sequestered
from each other.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.410
If we bring them here,
it's custodial.

07:57.443 --> 07:59.145
Do you wanna be reading
Miranda to 50 nuns?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.882
Yes. Go get them.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.119
32623-- Commonwealth
versus Joseph Watson--

08:06.152 --> 08:07.087
second-degree murder.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.722
Bobby Donnell for
the defendant, Your Honor.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.791
-Waive reading.
-Curtis Simmons for
the commonwealth.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.060
-We'd be opposing bail.
-My client isn't a flight risk.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.631
-Safety risk.
-This is the first time
he's ever shot anybody.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.033
Allegedly.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.702
JUDGE: I'm denying bail.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.237
Defense asks for
a probable cause hearing.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.772
This afternoon?

08:25.806 --> 08:26.773
Fine.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.543
I'll see Mr. Donnell
in chambers.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.051
How's she doing?

08:38.652 --> 08:41.988
-(door shuts)
-She's still in
critical condition.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.890
And you?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.028
I'm fine.

08:48.061 --> 08:51.464
Do you think maybe we could
get somebody in your firm
to handle this case?

08:51.497 --> 08:53.934
I'm fine. It's-- it's...

08:53.967 --> 08:57.403
-it's a good distraction.
-Yes, and you look distracted.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.205
Do you know what
you just said out there?

08:59.239 --> 09:02.609
"This is the first time
he's ever shot somebody"?

09:02.643 --> 09:06.212
That's not good defending talk.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.948
Why not take a few days?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.550
And do what?

09:09.583 --> 09:12.018
-What, just sit next to her bed?
-Yes.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.420
I can't do anything
for her there.

09:14.454 --> 09:15.722
It...

09:18.191 --> 09:20.093
I'm fine, Your Honor.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.931
Okay.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.806
(door closes)

09:36.442 --> 09:39.212
-Hey.
-Hi.

09:44.585 --> 09:48.021
Hey, Lindsay. It's me.

09:50.256 --> 09:54.327
The doctors say that you're...
you're doing good.

09:56.563 --> 09:59.299
Lucy's here.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.734
You been talking to her?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.603
Well, I've been afraid to

10:02.636 --> 10:04.638
since everyone
says I'm annoying.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.511
Ellenor's coming in
after lunch.

10:10.544 --> 10:13.013
LUCY: Her parents just left.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.284
We all love you.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.230
I love you.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.904
You just keep getting better.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.482
She's not dying. Get out.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.684
Get out! She's not dying!

10:50.717 --> 10:53.920
Bobby, it's me, Patrick.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.756
(sighs)

10:55.789 --> 10:57.891
I'm sorry.
I thought-- I thought--

10:57.924 --> 11:00.360
I know. It's all right.
I understand.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.963
Are you okay?

11:05.498 --> 11:08.134
Yeah. Yeah.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.473
Hail Mary, full of grace,

11:13.507 --> 11:15.375
the Lord is with thee.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.078
Blessed art thou
amongst women...

11:18.111 --> 11:20.814
BOTH: Blessed the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.784
Holy Mary, mother of God,

11:23.817 --> 11:27.554
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

11:27.588 --> 11:29.155
PATRICK: Amen.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.757
Amen.

11:40.214 --> 11:43.314
<i>Evidently, the police are on a</i>
<i>major nun roundup as we speak.</i>

11:43.314 --> 11:45.814
<i>You'll recall Lindsay Dole</i>
<i>was the attorney</i>

11:45.814 --> 11:47.949
<i>who secured the freedom</i>
<i>of Michael Kingston,</i>

11:48.103 --> 11:50.176
<i>the man accused of</i>
<i>murdering and mutilating</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:51.311
<i>sister Carolyn Oaks.</i>

11:51.344 --> 11:54.280
<i>Ms. Dole has apparently</i>
<i>identified a nun</i>

11:54.314 --> 11:55.315
<i>as her attacker,</i>

11:55.348 --> 11:58.752
and the police think
the two cases may be connected.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.555
(TV shuts off)

12:01.588 --> 12:04.024
How did this nun

12:04.057 --> 12:06.259
know Lindsay would be
working late alone?

12:06.292 --> 12:09.696
-I didn't tell.
-I'm not accusing you
of telling.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.964
I'm asking a question.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.700
(chuckles) Can't anybody
ask a question around here

12:13.734 --> 12:15.001
without people getting
all defensive?

12:15.035 --> 12:16.537
Why is everything an attack?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.271
Well, good to see
you don't get defensive.

12:18.304 --> 12:20.440
-Hey, know what--
-No, I don't know.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.343
-Let's not be biting
each others' heads off, please?
-I'm not biting heads.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.045
I ask a simple question,
and Lucy gets all--

12:25.078 --> 12:27.413
Well, you're accusing me
of being in cahoots with
the stabbing nun.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.415
Come on! Cut it out.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.387
The suspect matched
the description.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.421
We detained him--

12:35.455 --> 12:36.623
-The defendant?
-Yes.

12:36.657 --> 12:39.259
We found articles belonging
to the victim in his pockets,

12:39.292 --> 12:41.461
so we placed him
under arrest for murder,

12:41.494 --> 12:44.464
read him his rights, brought
him down to the precinct.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.600
Did he ever ask
for his lawyer?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.902
He barked out he was
entitled to a phone call

12:48.935 --> 12:50.370
to call his lawyer.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.873
Told him he could make that call
when he got to the precinct.

12:52.906 --> 12:55.842
-Did he make that call?
-I believe he did.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.478
He left a message
on the lawyer's machine.

12:58.512 --> 12:59.813
BOBBY: Thank you.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.982
Did you have occasion
to question the defendant?

13:02.015 --> 13:05.018
Yes, I did,
during which interrogation

13:05.051 --> 13:07.020
he confessed to killing
Jennifer Lyman,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.221
the owner of the vehicle.

13:08.254 --> 13:11.692
-He just confessed?
-That's correct.

13:11.725 --> 13:14.460
Did he hand you a cookie
with this confession?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.162
-Objection.
-Sustained.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.599
He never asked for his lawyer
during the interrogation?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.800
WITNESS: No, he did not.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.535
BOBBY: Did you know
he had called his lawyer?

13:21.568 --> 13:22.969
No, I did not.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.371
You didn't know when you walked
into the room to interrogate him

13:25.405 --> 13:27.040
that he had made a call
to his lawyer?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.943
I was told he was thinking about
contacting a lawyer. That's all.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.078
BOBBY: So what'd you say
when you walked in?

13:32.112 --> 13:35.048
Did you say anything with
respect to his hiring a lawyer?

13:35.081 --> 13:37.884
WITNESS: I said he was free
to bring in an attorney

13:37.918 --> 13:39.820
and, of course,
legally entitled to,

13:39.853 --> 13:41.688
but that he also
might want to consider

13:41.722 --> 13:42.756
talking to me without one.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.357
Why?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.659
Basically I convinced him

13:45.692 --> 13:49.830
that with cooperation comes
my recommendation for leniency.

13:49.863 --> 13:52.365
And we talked a little bit
more on that, and, uh,

13:52.398 --> 13:55.368
then he decided to speak
with me voluntarily

13:55.401 --> 13:57.504
at that time without
an attorney present.

13:57.538 --> 14:01.642
And it was in the course of this
voluntary discussion that...

14:01.675 --> 14:03.744
He confessed
to killing Ms. Lyman.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.579
BOBBY: Thank you.
Your Honor, at this time,

14:05.612 --> 14:08.849
the defense moves to suppress
my client's statement--

14:08.882 --> 14:11.552
Sixth Amendment,
Right to Counsel.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.420
Oral arguments tomorrow, 2:00.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.230
But the whole weekend?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.600
What about coming back
a little early?

14:27.333 --> 14:30.003
I just don't feel right
being away right now.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.906
She's in critical condition.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.641
You're right.

14:34.675 --> 14:36.643
I understand.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.713
Anything I can do, Jimmy?

14:39.746 --> 14:44.017
Just pray, I guess,
with the rest of us.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.288
It's okay.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.324
The doctors say we should
know something soon.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.760
But I don't know,
you get nicked in the heart,

14:53.794 --> 14:55.896
you can't...

15:04.104 --> 15:07.473
What? Jimmy, are you okay?

15:07.508 --> 15:08.775
What?

15:08.809 --> 15:10.777
Oh, uh, I was just, uh...

15:10.811 --> 15:12.713
thinking about something
the doctor said.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.515
That's all.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.219
Are you all right?

15:19.986 --> 15:21.487
Yeah. I'm just...

15:21.522 --> 15:24.991
This is all kind of stressful,
you know.

15:28.294 --> 15:32.498
At the risk of seeming
completely insensitive,

15:32.533 --> 15:34.400
my mother told me

15:34.434 --> 15:37.738
that the day
my father's father died,

15:37.771 --> 15:41.542
he was so despondent

15:41.575 --> 15:44.277
that all she wanted...

15:44.310 --> 15:46.547
was to take his mind off it,

15:46.580 --> 15:50.083
even if it were just
for a minute or two.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.820
And when all else fails...

15:53.854 --> 15:55.522
(unzips zipper)

15:55.556 --> 15:57.691
I'm not in the mood
for that right now.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.159
I am.

16:05.599 --> 16:07.433
Okay, thank you.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.478
Why are you doing this here?

16:18.512 --> 16:20.213
I convinced 'em
to do it all at once.

16:20.246 --> 16:22.015
There's no room
in the police station.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.985
-If this isn't a major
civil rights violation--
-Oh, go kill yourself.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.987
-Helen.
-It isn't custodial, Counsel.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.454
Any one of them
is free to leave.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.490
In which case, you told them,
they'd become suspects.

16:30.524 --> 16:33.326
Which just means more business
for lawyers like you.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.562
You should be thanking me,
you scumsucking--

16:35.596 --> 16:36.730
BOBBY: Helen.

16:36.763 --> 16:41.067
Helen, this is Father O'Bryan
from the archdiocese.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.203
Hello. What, did you come
to rescue one of your nuns

16:43.236 --> 16:46.306
-before we can
throw her in jail?
-Helen.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.509
-HELEN: They can go to hell.
-He's from the archdiocese.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.410
HELEN: I don't care.
One of their nuns
stabbed Lindsay.

16:50.443 --> 16:53.780
Bobby, I need you a second,
in private.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.188
Remember the...

17:06.693 --> 17:09.494
You told me you thought
Judge Kittleson was a psycho.

17:09.530 --> 17:12.665
Though, I don't think she is,
but that's what you said,
remember?

17:12.699 --> 17:13.934
Yeah. Why?

17:13.967 --> 17:16.569
Do you really think
she's crazy?

17:17.871 --> 17:21.340
I don't,
but maybe I'm too close.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.009
You know,
it's hard to see straight

17:23.042 --> 17:24.877
when a woman's got your...

17:24.911 --> 17:26.112
Never mind.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.782
Jimmy, what's going on?

17:29.883 --> 17:32.152
I'm sure this is nothing...

17:37.924 --> 17:40.727
But I found a picture
in her office.

17:40.761 --> 17:42.529
It was of you and Lindsay,

17:42.563 --> 17:46.667
and Lindsay's face
was all scratched out.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.638
A picture...

17:51.672 --> 17:52.906
of me and Lindsay?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.641
Taken on the street somewhere,

17:54.675 --> 17:56.376
like you were being stalked.

17:57.778 --> 18:00.280
I'm sure it's nothing, but...

18:05.385 --> 18:08.121
-I can't get a warrant on that.
-She's crazy.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.856
She's obsessed with me.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.592
-You don't know that.
-I do know it!

18:11.625 --> 18:13.660
Go to the magistrate
in Middlesex.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.562
Drunk Harry gives out
warrants like gum.

18:15.596 --> 18:18.064
Come on. You're the lawyers.
We haven't got cause here.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.301
I heard her tell me she planned
to kill Lindsay.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.436
-What?
-In chambers. She said it.

18:23.469 --> 18:25.205
There's your cause.
Go get the warrant.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.940
Nice try, Bobby.

18:26.973 --> 18:29.075
We've got the boyfriend
Jimmy Berluti

18:29.109 --> 18:31.211
coming forward, implicating her.
That's cause.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.913
He didn't really implicate her.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.515
Yes, he did. Right, Bobby?

18:34.548 --> 18:35.315
Right.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.850
Go get the warrant.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.329
-(door closes)
-(pager beeping)

18:50.396 --> 18:52.165
-EUGENE: Bobby.
-What happened?

18:52.198 --> 18:53.433
-She's okay.
-Let's go.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.635
-Hold on.
-I said, let's go.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.703
Listen to me.
She looks worse than she is.

18:56.737 --> 18:59.439
Something went wrong with
her breathing, but every--

19:03.276 --> 19:04.611
Where's the doctor?

19:04.645 --> 19:07.581
She's out in the hall somewhere,
but I have the information.

19:07.614 --> 19:08.582
I want the doctor.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.483
Okay. I'll get her.
I'll get her.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.853
She went into
respiratory distress.

19:12.886 --> 19:16.089
Basically, her lungs crashed,
but they're inflating now.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.423
Why isn't she waking up?

19:17.457 --> 19:19.993
The doctor said that it was
just gonna take some time.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.596
It's been 24 hours.
Why isn't she waking up?

19:22.629 --> 19:25.098
Bobby, why don't you
just sit with her?

19:25.131 --> 19:27.200
No, I'm in court.
I-I'm in court,

19:27.233 --> 19:28.635
and I--I gotta...

19:28.669 --> 19:31.137
-I'm in court.
-Ellenor, would you, uh,
excuse us for a second?

19:31.171 --> 19:35.041
-I'd like to talk to him.
-Yeah. Fill me in on the master
plan behind this one.

19:35.075 --> 19:37.410
-Ellenor.
-ELLENOR: Sure.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.651
Don't talk to me.

19:44.685 --> 19:47.420
I will talk to you.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.890
You sat by your mother
holding her hand.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.291
Didn't work for her, so--

19:51.324 --> 19:53.594
I didn't ask you
to come help me through this.

19:53.627 --> 19:54.628
Of course not.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.897
You go through everything
alone, don't you?

19:56.930 --> 20:00.901
Why don't you go find somebody
who needs your help?

20:03.570 --> 20:06.372
You really love her, don't you?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.275
(scoffs)

20:09.309 --> 20:11.344
Why would I ever tell you?

20:12.613 --> 20:15.248
You'd just pass it on to God,
and he'd kill her.

20:16.282 --> 20:19.185
You believe that God kills
the people you love.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.621
That's your theory.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.189
That's my history.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.425
Fine.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.327
But she doesn't need
a fat, old priest

20:27.360 --> 20:29.229
holding her hand right now.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.665
She needs you.

21:05.999 --> 21:08.769
(police radio chatter)

21:21.014 --> 21:23.550
Your Honor, we have a warrant
to search your house.

21:23.584 --> 21:25.151
If you'll excuse us, please.

21:25.185 --> 21:26.452
Check every closet,
under every bed.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.622
What in God's name is this?

21:28.655 --> 21:31.157
-Step aside, Your Honor.
-What are you looking for?

21:31.191 --> 21:33.560
Evidence in connection
with the attempted murder
of Lindsay Dole.

21:33.594 --> 21:36.930
What?! On what basis
do you get such a warrant?

21:36.963 --> 21:39.132
Your Honor,
if you'll just cooperate,
we'll do this quickly.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.134
-This is preposterous.
-Your Honor--

21:41.167 --> 21:43.103
I know she is your roommate,
Ms. Gamble,

21:43.136 --> 21:44.270
but that does not
give you the r--

21:44.304 --> 21:46.472
Detective!

21:47.073 --> 21:49.375
Oh, please.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.979
Read her her rights.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.182
Your Honor, if you'll place
your hands behind your back.

21:56.216 --> 21:59.753
You are making a big mistake.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.188
MIKE: You have the right
to remain silent.

22:02.222 --> 22:03.757
Anything you say
can and will be used

22:03.790 --> 22:05.526
against you
in a court of law.

22:05.559 --> 22:07.594
You have the right to talk to
a lawyer and have him present

22:07.628 --> 22:10.396
before and during
all questioning...

22:14.400 --> 22:16.637
(buzzer sounds)

22:25.245 --> 22:27.080
Roberta...

22:30.150 --> 22:31.351
I am innocent.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.820
I didn't ask.

22:35.722 --> 22:38.224
What was with the nun suit?

22:38.258 --> 22:39.926
It was a costume.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.963
I was gonna wear it
to some Halloween party,

22:42.996 --> 22:44.631
disguised as a prude.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.935
I...

23:00.346 --> 23:01.848
-Nothing?
-Nothing too relevant.

23:01.882 --> 23:03.684
A manuscript
for a novel she started,

23:03.717 --> 23:05.552
had some pretty kinky
murders in it.

23:05.586 --> 23:08.254
-Stabbings?
-Yeah, but, Helen,

23:08.288 --> 23:10.456
there was no physical evidence.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.559
What about
the little nun outfit?

23:12.593 --> 23:13.994
Says it was for a costume party.

23:14.027 --> 23:16.997
-She ever wear it to any party?
-Not that we could confirm.

23:17.030 --> 23:19.800
I think this woman's
really crazy, Mike.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.536
I wouldn't go to an arraignment
with what we have so far.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.105
Keep looking.
I'll push the arraignment
to tomorrow.

23:30.476 --> 23:33.413
Bobby. Bobby.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.848
You're due in court
in half an hour.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.183
-I think I'll take it.
-No, I can--

23:37.217 --> 23:38.251
-Bobby.
-I can do it.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.053
Eugene, I said I can do it.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.755
Why isn't she waking up?

23:41.788 --> 23:44.658
You said 24 hours. It's been
way more than 24 hours.

23:44.691 --> 23:46.527
-Why isn't she waking up?
-Mr. Donnell!

23:46.560 --> 23:49.462
Sometimes guests
of this hospital

23:49.495 --> 23:52.332
need to be reminded
that they're guests.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.601
LINDSAY: Bobby...

23:56.302 --> 23:57.971
BOBBY: Lindsay.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.608
Lindsay.

24:03.076 --> 24:04.645
I hurt.

24:06.813 --> 24:09.082
Yeah, you, um...

24:09.115 --> 24:11.151
you had-- you had an accident,

24:11.184 --> 24:13.253
and-- but you're gonna be okay.

24:13.286 --> 24:14.988
You just-- you just
had an accident.

24:15.021 --> 24:19.392
-I'm in the hospital?
-Yeah. I'm right here.

24:19.425 --> 24:22.028
And, um, and Eugene's here, too.

24:22.062 --> 24:24.030
(Lindsay groans)

24:24.064 --> 24:26.933
I was stabbed.

24:26.967 --> 24:29.302
Some guy stabbed me.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.505
Yeah. Yeah, but...

24:34.074 --> 24:35.742
Guy?

24:37.511 --> 24:40.914
You said-- you said "nun."

24:40.947 --> 24:43.216
It was--

24:43.249 --> 24:48.054
it was a guy in a nun... suit.

24:52.092 --> 24:54.394
Did-- did you see his face?

24:54.427 --> 24:56.597
Um, no.

24:58.298 --> 25:01.067
But I saw his hands.

25:01.101 --> 25:03.203
And he was so strong.

25:04.404 --> 25:06.707
He couldn't have been a woman.

25:06.740 --> 25:10.176
Sweetheart-- sweetheart,
are you sure?

25:10.210 --> 25:11.878
Yeah.

25:11.912 --> 25:13.446
Ow.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.015
Don't try to move.
Just rest, okay?

25:15.048 --> 25:16.983
BOBBY: That's right.
That's right. You just...

25:17.017 --> 25:19.019
You...

25:19.052 --> 25:21.822
you just rest.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.028
I love you.

25:28.061 --> 25:29.630
(whimpers)

25:29.663 --> 25:32.265
I love you, too.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.004
Kingston.

25:39.439 --> 25:40.607
What?

25:40.641 --> 25:43.910
The nun killer.

25:43.944 --> 25:46.312
He said...

25:46.346 --> 25:48.582
he said I was virginal

25:48.615 --> 25:51.017
and that-- that, uh,

25:51.051 --> 25:53.654
after the case,

25:53.687 --> 25:55.689
he said, "See you soon."

25:59.459 --> 26:02.195
I think it was him.

26:05.766 --> 26:07.901
Helen, he's got
a barricaded door.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.169
-You'll have to break it down.
-We will.

26:09.202 --> 26:10.871
Mike's gotta go get
Lindsay's statement first.

26:10.904 --> 26:12.438
It's the only way
we can get a warrant.

26:12.472 --> 26:13.840
-Is she okay?
-I think so.

26:13.874 --> 26:15.876
The guy she put back out there.
Can you believe it?

26:15.909 --> 26:17.911
-EUGENE: Come on, Bobby.
-Because of her, he walks,

26:17.944 --> 26:19.580
-and she--
-We'll get him,
we'll get him, Bobby.

26:19.613 --> 26:21.782
Don't worry.

26:26.319 --> 26:29.623
Okay, ma'am, free to go.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.619
I am sorry.

26:58.652 --> 27:01.487
I saw the picture
of Bobby and Lindsay

27:01.522 --> 27:03.089
with the face all scratched.

27:03.123 --> 27:06.192
My brain just started
going sideways.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.839
He asked for his lawyer.

27:18.872 --> 27:21.174
No. He said he wanted
to call his lawyer.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.309
-There's a difference.
-What difference?

27:23.343 --> 27:26.279
We have no evidence that
he wanted to engage
the legal services--

27:26.312 --> 27:29.516
No. He was calling him to ask
the price of fresh fruit.

27:29.550 --> 27:31.618
Come on, Mr. Simmons.

27:31.652 --> 27:33.620
Even if the court
wants to conclude

27:33.654 --> 27:35.188
he asked for an attorney...

27:35.221 --> 27:38.525
-The court does.
-He did not have an attorney.

27:38.559 --> 27:39.960
He was not represented
by counsel.

27:39.993 --> 27:41.995
He'd only left a message
on a machine.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.664
As soon as he asks
for his lawyer--

27:43.697 --> 27:45.599
This man was not interrogated.

27:45.632 --> 27:46.933
Not interrogated?

27:46.967 --> 27:49.102
Detective Smiley said it would
be better to cooperate.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.505
He never denied him
the right to a lawyer.

27:51.538 --> 27:53.473
He didn't push forward
with questions.

27:53.507 --> 27:54.941
All he said is

27:54.975 --> 27:58.011
it might be better for him
to talk without a lawyer,

27:58.044 --> 28:00.781
and at that point,
Mr. Watson agreed.

28:00.814 --> 28:02.849
It doesn't matter
that he agreed.

28:02.883 --> 28:06.019
Why not? Are you suggesting he's
not free to change his own mind?

28:06.052 --> 28:08.388
That's exactly
what I'm suggesting.

28:08.421 --> 28:09.956
Once he asks for his lawyer--

28:09.990 --> 28:12.626
Counsel, your client
is a career criminal.

28:12.659 --> 28:15.629
One could argue he knows
how these things go.

28:15.662 --> 28:19.399
You're saying he lacks the right
to change his mind

28:19.432 --> 28:20.867
and waive counsel.

28:20.901 --> 28:24.638
Yes. Once a suspect
asks for his lawyer--

28:24.671 --> 28:26.106
You sound like a broken record.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.908
The law is a broken record.
Don't you get that,
you idiot?

28:27.941 --> 28:28.909
-Hey!
-JUDGE: Bobby.

28:28.942 --> 28:30.777
BOBBY:
The law says once he says,

28:30.811 --> 28:32.278
"I need a lawyer"
or "I want one"

28:32.312 --> 28:33.680
or "I think I want one,"

28:33.714 --> 28:35.481
it's game over
as far as the police goes.

28:35.516 --> 28:37.584
They don't even get to say,
"Hi. How's it goin'?"

28:37.618 --> 28:41.121
-Why? If he--
-Because we don't trust
the police not to interrogate,

28:41.154 --> 28:43.456
and we don't trust
these suspects to know
what the hell is going on.

28:43.489 --> 28:44.658
They're stupid.

28:44.691 --> 28:46.560
We don't give them
the right to waive counsel

28:46.593 --> 28:48.161
'cause they're so stupid,
they would.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.863
They're scum with
third-grade educations.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.331
They kill people and laugh,

28:51.364 --> 28:54.000
and the courts are here
to protect them at all costs.

28:54.034 --> 28:54.801
Counsel!

28:54.835 --> 28:56.870
We don't care about the victims.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.004
They're dead already.

28:58.038 --> 28:59.873
We come in here worrying
about the Constitution

28:59.906 --> 29:02.643
and the rights of these
brain-dead pieces of crap

29:02.676 --> 29:04.545
because they're what
the system is all about.

29:04.578 --> 29:05.812
All right, Bobby.

29:05.846 --> 29:08.582
Now you may not like that,
but that's how it works.

29:08.615 --> 29:10.350
We need to protect these asses,

29:10.383 --> 29:13.353
and his sixth-amendment rights
were violated here,

29:13.386 --> 29:16.657
so as a matter of law, we need
to put him back out there

29:16.690 --> 29:18.625
so he can go shoot
somebody else,

29:18.659 --> 29:20.827
which is what
you're gonna do, right?

29:20.861 --> 29:23.363
Tell the judge you need
to go out and kill somebody

29:23.396 --> 29:25.398
-because you're running
behind schedule.
-Bobby!

29:25.431 --> 29:28.234
No! We need to protect
the Bill of Rights.

29:28.268 --> 29:32.005
We need to protect
the Bill of Rights!

29:36.376 --> 29:39.079
That's enough, Bobby.

29:47.754 --> 29:50.056
-This is as far as you go.
-Mike...

29:50.090 --> 29:52.025
This guy has a gun fetish,
remember?

29:52.058 --> 29:54.094
(sighs)

30:10.043 --> 30:12.846
Police officers.
Can we come in?

30:17.250 --> 30:18.451
Go.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.494
-OFFICER: Clear!
-OFFICER #2: Clear!

30:28.529 --> 30:30.230
OFFICER #3: Clear!

30:42.275 --> 30:44.511
(Kingston grunts)

30:47.581 --> 30:49.916
Do you know why you're dying?

30:50.717 --> 30:52.919
You stabbed the wrong girl.

30:52.953 --> 30:55.121
Can you hear me, Mike?

30:55.155 --> 30:58.258
-You know why you're dying?
-Helen.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.526
(woman groans)

31:00.761 --> 31:02.863
(moans)

31:04.831 --> 31:06.733
My God...

31:06.767 --> 31:08.869
What, does he just collect 'em?

31:14.875 --> 31:16.309
So he had another one?

31:16.342 --> 31:19.045
If you waited another day
to regain consciousness
and I. D. him,

31:19.079 --> 31:20.681
she could be dead, too.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.849
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

31:22.883 --> 31:24.685
You look great.

31:24.718 --> 31:27.020
Hey, a tape came with these.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.222
-Who's it from?
-It doesn't say.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.625
Oh, stick it in.
It's probably from my parents.

31:32.859 --> 31:34.761
So it was Kingston.

31:34.795 --> 31:36.029
Seems so.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.765
Only thing is,
this last girl he kidnapped--

31:38.799 --> 31:40.400
it was the same day
of your assault,

31:40.433 --> 31:43.336
and she doesn't think
he ever left the apartment.

31:45.606 --> 31:47.974
So maybe it wasn't him?

31:48.008 --> 31:49.743
HELEN: Well, she can't be sure
he didn't leave,

31:49.776 --> 31:51.712
and we think
he must have.

31:51.745 --> 31:54.548
<i>MAN (on tape):</i>
<i>(whistles) Hello.</i>

31:54.581 --> 31:56.817
<i>Heard you were feeling</i>
<i>some chest pains, Lindsay.</i>

31:56.850 --> 31:59.385
<i>I simply had to extend</i>
<i>my good wishes.</i>

31:59.419 --> 32:02.255
<i>Whenever I hear of somebody</i>
<i>getting stabbed,</i>

32:02.288 --> 32:05.992
<i>my head just goes to that</i>
<i>poor Susan Robin girl.</i>

32:06.026 --> 32:09.495
<i>So young to be</i>
<i>losing her head.</i>

32:09.530 --> 32:11.264
<i>Anyway...</i>

32:11.297 --> 32:13.466
<i>hope you're feeling better.</i>

32:15.501 --> 32:17.103
<i>Kisses to Bobby.</i>

32:18.104 --> 32:20.206
<i>And Ellenor...</i>

32:20.240 --> 32:23.677
<i>why doesn't she</i>
<i>ever work late?</i>

32:24.190 --> 32:30.342
(tone playing)

32:36.156 --> 32:37.490
-I'll bring him in
for questioning.
-It isn't Joey Heric.

32:37.524 --> 32:39.092
He just can't resist the game.
That's all it was about.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.694
I don't like him knowing
about Susan Robin.

32:40.727 --> 32:43.196
-What is that about?
-Everybody knows
about Susan Robin.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.665
It was front-page news.

32:44.698 --> 32:47.067
What's your theory, Helen, that
Joey Heric killed Susan Robin?

32:47.934 --> 32:50.671
He's always had some sort of
special hatred towards Ellenor.

32:50.704 --> 32:52.172
Ellenor dated George Vogelman.

32:52.205 --> 32:53.907
Maybe it's about framing George.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.041
That's a bit of
a chess game, isn't it?

32:55.075 --> 32:56.376
Who's the sickest
chess player we know?

32:56.409 --> 32:58.478
Look, if Joey has this
special hatred toward me,

32:58.512 --> 33:00.581
-why did he stab Lindsay?
-I don't know.

33:00.614 --> 33:02.916
Like any of this is
supposed to make sense?

33:02.949 --> 33:04.518
We're dealing
with a psychotic.

33:04.551 --> 33:06.252
So what are you gonna do now,
get another warrant

33:06.286 --> 33:07.721
and knock down
Joey Heric's door?

33:07.754 --> 33:09.155
Shut up, Eugene.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.594
What if Michael Kingston
didn't do this?

33:13.627 --> 33:15.061
We just assassinated the guy.

33:15.095 --> 33:17.531
Oh, yeah, an innocent man.
All he did was kill a nun.

33:18.198 --> 33:21.134
I'm bringing Joey in.
I suggest you find George.

33:21.167 --> 33:24.070
-If Joey did frame George,
maybe he saw him that night.
-(pager beeping)

33:24.104 --> 33:26.172
Hiller's back with her ruling.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.709
Great.

33:28.742 --> 33:30.443
What?!

33:31.545 --> 33:33.947
It's just a theory.

33:33.980 --> 33:36.249
-Why would he want to frame me?
-I don't know.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.418
Maybe he knew
you'd come running to us.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.587
Maybe he thought that
you and I were still dating.

33:40.621 --> 33:41.822
I-- I don't know.

33:41.855 --> 33:43.223
Doesn't make sense.

33:43.256 --> 33:46.026
Look, George,
you know, some murderers

33:46.059 --> 33:48.261
want to be caught
by specific people.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.597
And Joey Heric, he is this...

33:50.631 --> 33:53.399
narcissistic, sick...

33:57.237 --> 33:59.172
And look, I don't really think

33:59.205 --> 34:00.507
he's the one
who stabbed Lindsay,

34:00.541 --> 34:02.876
and I don't think he's the one
who killed Susan Robin,

34:02.909 --> 34:05.011
but stranger things
have happened.

34:05.045 --> 34:06.913
And God knows he loves
seeing us spin,

34:06.947 --> 34:08.782
which we're
certainly doing now.

34:10.917 --> 34:12.619
Here's his picture.

34:12.652 --> 34:15.088
Did you see anybody that night
who looks like him?

34:16.322 --> 34:18.925
Well, his face
looks familiar, but...

34:18.958 --> 34:20.193
that's probably from
seeing him in the news

34:20.226 --> 34:21.460
when you guys
were defending him.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.630
George, you have
got to think back

34:24.665 --> 34:27.467
to the night that
Susan Robin was murdered.

34:28.368 --> 34:31.137
You didn't see
anyone like him?

34:33.339 --> 34:35.542
I don't think I did, Ellenor.

34:55.128 --> 34:57.297
It seems silly...

34:57.330 --> 35:00.734
a suspect can't change his mind.

35:00.767 --> 35:04.905
Here, the defendant
was given his rights.

35:04.938 --> 35:07.741
He wasn't coerced or beaten.

35:07.774 --> 35:10.877
He decides he'll cooperate...

35:10.911 --> 35:12.412
but the law says,

35:12.445 --> 35:15.849
too bad once he asks
for counsel,

35:15.882 --> 35:18.952
the police can't even ask him
what he wants for dinner.

35:18.985 --> 35:22.088
And without the confession...

35:22.122 --> 35:24.324
this man walks.

35:24.357 --> 35:27.928
Because they've
got nothing else.

35:28.629 --> 35:33.133
A month ago, I was faced
with putting a nun killer

35:33.166 --> 35:36.469
back on the street
because of a bad search.

35:36.503 --> 35:39.573
Though I recognized
the absurdity

35:39.606 --> 35:43.510
of the application of the Fourth
Amendment in that instance...

35:45.646 --> 35:48.281
I was the good judge.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.617
I followed the law...

35:50.651 --> 35:53.086
set the man free.

35:53.119 --> 35:56.389
And two nights ago...

35:56.422 --> 36:00.994
the lawyer who championed both
him and the Fourth Amendment...

36:01.027 --> 36:04.330
it seems he stabbed her.

36:08.569 --> 36:12.773
The way we keep putting
them back out there...

36:15.676 --> 36:17.978
It takes a brave judge

36:18.011 --> 36:20.914
to look beyond
the horror at hand

36:20.947 --> 36:22.649
and nevertheless cling

36:22.683 --> 36:25.451
to the principles
of our Constitution,

36:25.485 --> 36:29.623
principles we proudly
live by in this room.

36:35.061 --> 36:37.463
I, um...

36:40.100 --> 36:43.570
I'm afraid I'm not
that brave any longer.

36:46.507 --> 36:49.676
If you see the street again,
Mr. Watson,

36:49.710 --> 36:52.012
it'll be through
the Appeals Court.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.681
You won't get there by my gavel.

36:55.982 --> 36:57.618
The motion to suppress
is denied.

36:57.651 --> 37:00.821
The defendant will stand trial.
Adjourned.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.766
-We just found the weapon.
-What?

37:12.799 --> 37:15.401
In a dumpster behind
Michael Kingston's apartment.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.472
-And Joey Heric?
-Says he was on a date.

37:19.506 --> 37:21.074
We're trying to verify.

37:21.107 --> 37:22.342
I think Eugene's right.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.344
He's just having
some fun with you.

37:24.377 --> 37:26.379
I got to find Helen.

37:29.750 --> 37:30.917
Kingston.

37:30.951 --> 37:33.053
Unless Joey planted the knife.

37:33.086 --> 37:36.857
I never rule him out, Eugene.

37:36.890 --> 37:39.359
It wasn't Joey Heric.

37:45.265 --> 37:48.001
I might as well go home
and burn my robe.

37:48.034 --> 37:49.770
It was within your discretion.

37:49.803 --> 37:53.707
Hey, these laws don't get
revisited higher up

37:53.740 --> 37:57.477
unless some superior court judge
forces the issue.

37:59.312 --> 38:00.947
How are you doing?

38:02.783 --> 38:04.150
I'm fine.

38:04.184 --> 38:06.620
You were booked
on a homicide, Roberta.

38:06.653 --> 38:09.422
-Don't tell me you're fine.
-(knock on door)

38:12.559 --> 38:14.961
I'll be in my chambers.

38:18.498 --> 38:22.769
You don't ever want to be
appearing before me, Counsel.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.442
-(door closes)
-Please... get out.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.978
I never really thought
you did this, Your Honor.

38:32.012 --> 38:34.380
I simply had to recognize that--

38:34.414 --> 38:36.382
That you couldn't
be certain I didn't.

38:36.416 --> 38:40.353
Well, sometimes people
react bigger to things when...

38:40.386 --> 38:42.122
emotions are runnin' high.

38:42.155 --> 38:45.325
This was a friend of mine
who got stabbed.

38:45.358 --> 38:47.060
A dear friend.

38:47.093 --> 38:49.195
And you...

38:49.229 --> 38:52.065
you might be somebody
that I've, uh...

38:53.233 --> 38:55.669
fallen in love with...

38:55.702 --> 38:57.137
a little.

38:57.170 --> 39:00.406
So just the idea
that you might not be

39:00.440 --> 39:01.675
the person I thought you were,

39:01.708 --> 39:04.678
it made me have
this big overreaction.

39:06.780 --> 39:09.950
I don't know how to say
how sorry I really am.

39:09.983 --> 39:13.687
Trust me, whether
you are able to convey

39:13.720 --> 39:17.257
your sorrow here
is completely irrelevant.

39:17.290 --> 39:19.826
Please, leave.

39:21.828 --> 39:24.698
I don't want it
to be over between us.

39:24.731 --> 39:26.366
It is.

39:26.399 --> 39:30.637
Whatever you believe,
Jimmy, believe that.

39:41.081 --> 39:43.416
(door closes)

39:45.285 --> 39:48.354
I'd feel better
if they at least found
Kingston's prints on the knife.

39:48.388 --> 39:51.424
It was him, Lindsay.
You can relax.

39:51.457 --> 39:53.894
-Are you really okay?
-Yeah.

39:53.927 --> 39:56.062
I think I'm just tired
from all the visits--

39:56.096 --> 39:58.832
you know, from my parents,
everybody from the office,

39:58.865 --> 40:00.734
Joey Heric--

40:00.767 --> 40:02.969
I guess that's my cue to leave.

40:03.003 --> 40:05.338
-Take care.
-Thanks, Father.

40:05.371 --> 40:07.473
Yeah. Thanks.

40:07.508 --> 40:09.543
You take care, too, Bobby.

40:09.576 --> 40:12.012
-I will.
-Father.

40:12.045 --> 40:14.480
-Kiss my ass.
-Excuse me?

40:14.515 --> 40:17.217
I read in the paper
your little quotes,

40:17.250 --> 40:19.553
what you said
to the archdiocese.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.487
Oh, Father, I was acting out.

40:21.522 --> 40:24.390
I thought a nun had...

40:24.424 --> 40:27.293
She's my best friend,
my roommate. I--

40:27.327 --> 40:28.562
Look, I'm Catholic.

40:28.595 --> 40:30.764
With Catholics like you,
who needs Protestants?

40:30.797 --> 40:33.366
Oh, now that's a sound bite
for tolerance.

40:33.399 --> 40:35.435
-Helen.
-Maybe you could kiss my--

40:35.468 --> 40:37.571
Helen! Come on.

40:38.338 --> 40:41.107
-How you doin'?
-I'm fine.

40:42.843 --> 40:43.877
Uh, listen,

40:43.910 --> 40:46.613
I've been waiting all day
to be alone with her.

40:46.647 --> 40:48.448
What, you want me to leave?

40:49.115 --> 40:51.017
-Yes.
-Well, I won't.

40:51.051 --> 40:52.152
Helen.

40:52.185 --> 40:53.419
No, I've hardly
seen her at all.

40:53.453 --> 40:54.855
It's not like
you two can do anything.

40:54.888 --> 40:56.657
-She has tubes all over her.
-I want to talk to her.

40:56.690 --> 40:59.425
Well, then talk to her.
There's nothing you can't
say to her in front of me--

40:59.459 --> 41:01.595
There are some things.

41:01.628 --> 41:04.898
I'm not leaving.
Say what you got to say.

41:04.931 --> 41:06.900
Make it quick.
I'll cover my ears.

41:06.933 --> 41:09.435
(scoffs) All right.

41:09.469 --> 41:12.038
Um...

41:18.411 --> 41:20.547
-Marry me.
-What?

41:20.581 --> 41:23.817
-Do ya mind?
-Sorry.

41:25.886 --> 41:27.353
Marry you?

41:27.387 --> 41:30.557
These past two days,
I realized that...

41:31.491 --> 41:34.160
I can't live without you.

41:34.194 --> 41:36.096
And I don't want to.

41:37.831 --> 41:40.701
Bobby, marriage may--
probably not something

41:40.734 --> 41:42.836
you should decide
in the heat of a crisis.

41:42.869 --> 41:44.971
Lindsay, if there's anything
that this crisis has taught me,

41:45.005 --> 41:47.508
it's that I want
to grow old with you.

41:47.541 --> 41:49.409
And I want you
to grow old with me.

41:49.442 --> 41:51.277
I love you.

41:51.311 --> 41:53.113
And I want to be your husband.

41:55.916 --> 41:58.652
And I want you to be my wife.

42:01.487 --> 42:04.090
-I don't know what to say.
-Just say, "yes."

42:04.124 --> 42:05.826
-Quiet.
-Sorry.

42:10.230 --> 42:12.866
You want to think it over?

42:14.635 --> 42:17.003
Yeah... I--

42:17.037 --> 42:18.238
I think I should.

42:18.271 --> 42:21.241
Uh... okay.

42:25.011 --> 42:26.146
I thought it over.

42:27.848 --> 42:29.015
Yes.

42:30.116 --> 42:31.484
-Really?
-Really.

42:31.518 --> 42:33.219
Really?

42:33.253 --> 42:35.689
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, God.

42:36.657 --> 42:38.959
Bobby, that-- that's not--
that's not how it works.

42:40.827 --> 42:44.097
-Please, can you leave now?
-Not a chance.

42:44.130 --> 42:46.567
Just ignore her, Bobby.

42:47.668 --> 42:50.303
Oh, I almost, uh...
I almost forgot.

42:51.104 --> 42:53.006
I, uh...

42:53.039 --> 42:55.275
I got this for you.

42:55.308 --> 42:56.977
Oh, Bobby...

42:57.010 --> 42:58.111
It's so big.

42:58.144 --> 42:59.846
-Helen.
-Quiet.

42:59.880 --> 43:01.147
Sorry.

43:04.851 --> 43:06.887
Ohh...

43:09.656 --> 43:11.725
I love you.

43:12.659 --> 43:15.195
One second. Look away.

43:21.668 --> 43:24.805
I love you.

44:28.869 --> 44:31.905
(theme music playing)

44:47.754 --> 44:49.556
You stinker!
