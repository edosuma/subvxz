00:13.860 --> 00:18.280
Beyond these walls, there is a sea, or so said Armin ...

00:22.710 --> 00:24.290
But beyond the sea ...

00:26.130 --> 00:29.500
I always wondered what it is ...

02:04.970 --> 02:09.979
"Smoke signals"

02:11.060 --> 02:13.860
Search only trying to steal some food, Sasha

02:13.860 --> 02:17.780
And Levi convince the captain to make small slices easier to bite.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.180
I will not do that! Probably...

02:19.820 --> 02:20.780
What?

02:20.780 --> 02:24.450
Hey! Guys, have you clean your shoes before entering?

02:24.450 --> 02:25.200
Thing?

02:25.490 --> 02:29.460
No, we did not. Do not you see how many things are we carrying?

02:29.460 --> 02:33.590
Do you seriously believe that this attitude will please the captain Levi?

02:33.590 --> 02:36.880
If I had not personally folded the sheets you this morning ...

02:36.880 --> 02:40.300
Stop complaining! Who are you, my mother ?!

02:40.300 --> 02:41.640
We're back.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.760
Wait, you were chopping wood?

02:44.140 --> 02:45.600
I have to stay in shape.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.600
You were grabbed by a Giant! You should be in bed.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.440
I try to stop her, but I did not listen.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.980
I saw her do abdominal before!

02:53.060 --> 02:54.900
How dare you, voyeur!

02:54.900 --> 02:58.440
Eh ?! How would "peek" ?! -Mikasa, you know you're not an animal wild, right?

02:58.860 --> 03:02.600
It seems almost like being back in the cadet corps.

03:03.120 --> 03:03.680
And...

03:04.450 --> 03:08.580
So why do you think that we have been chosen for the new team of Levi?

03:09.040 --> 03:12.420
Protect Eren e Historia is an important mission ...

03:12.420 --> 03:14.350
Because we are talented, I suppose.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.590
Sasha ... What did you just put in the bag?

03:19.130 --> 03:21.430
Nothing bread-related.

03:21.590 --> 03:23.340
Because you!

03:23.340 --> 03:24.470
I restituiscilo.

03:24.470 --> 03:28.270
Hey, let's focus! We have to finish the cleaning before it returns the captain!

03:28.270 --> 03:29.850
Put the bread in place.

03:29.850 --> 03:30.980
What's all the fuss?

03:30.980 --> 03:32.270
How many times have you already done?

03:32.270 --> 03:34.360
The food reserves are precious!

03:34.360 --> 03:37.240
Enough of this nonsense, girl of potatoes!

03:45.620 --> 03:48.030
I'm pretty sure I've given you enough time.

03:51.910 --> 03:53.290
Anyway...

03:53.290 --> 03:56.540
We will discuss the poor job of cleaning it again.

03:56.840 --> 03:57.580
They were.

03:58.210 --> 04:01.220
Hange is looking forward to starting the experiments.

04:01.220 --> 04:02.490
G-Right!

04:09.560 --> 04:10.270
They were!

04:10.430 --> 04:13.440
What's wrong, Eren ?! Get up!

04:13.440 --> 04:16.649
The future of humanity is counting on you!

04:16.649 --> 04:18.899
Get up, dammit!

04:18.899 --> 04:19.740
Hey, four eyes.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.360
This time it does not seem just like usual.

04:22.900 --> 04:27.070
It is not even 10 meters high, and also lack of muscles in certain parts of the body.

04:27.070 --> 04:28.950
Moreover, Eren has her ass in the air.

04:28.950 --> 04:30.330
I realized it!

04:30.700 --> 04:33.290
Eren! You can still move ?!

04:33.290 --> 04:35.290
Give us a sign or something!

04:35.830 --> 04:36.640
They were!

04:37.170 --> 04:37.920
Mikasa!

04:38.340 --> 04:42.410
Hey ... That brat is acting alone again.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.430
It's time to think of a punishment?

04:44.430 --> 04:46.970
No, not by any signal ... We're done here!

04:47.140 --> 04:48.850
They were!

04:51.140 --> 04:54.520
Hot! Damn, you're hot!

04:54.940 --> 04:57.190
Hange, wait! Eren is bleeding!

04:57.190 --> 04:59.940
Whoa! Have a look, Moblit!

04:59.940 --> 05:02.070
The face of Eren! Hurry up and draw it!

05:02.360 --> 05:05.700
Commander! It has a little 'pity ?!

05:12.200 --> 05:14.040
Sorry, I got carried away ...

05:15.040 --> 05:16.740
It seems that we still have a long way to go ...

05:18.250 --> 05:21.580
... before you can use the hardening capacity of the Giant and seal the walls.

05:21.960 --> 05:26.880
Yes ... I knew that we would cling to a faint hope from the beginning.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.300
Strategically, it is not a bad plan.

05:29.300 --> 05:33.220
Instead of dragging tons of food, everything we would need to convey Eren there.

05:33.890 --> 05:37.350
On whether it is possible or not ... it all depends on Eren ..

05:38.690 --> 05:41.940
The experiment is over! To all troops disperse immediately!

05:41.940 --> 05:42.670
Roger!

05:43.230 --> 05:44.860
Make sure there are no witnesses!

05:44.860 --> 05:45.510
Yes, sir!

05:49.280 --> 05:51.160
You will climb the same wagon Eren.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.550
I am directed to Trost District with the Hange group.

05:55.910 --> 05:56.670
All right.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.750
You have to find it right away.

06:01.380 --> 06:06.420
Only her ... She might even know the truth that we can perceive.

06:19.690 --> 06:23.940
"District Of Trost"

06:20.900 --> 06:23.940
I see ... Another failure, then.

06:24.860 --> 06:30.660
If the plan worked, we could plug the hole in the Shiganshina district in less than a day.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.370
Is it because we lack the necessary information.

06:32.870 --> 06:36.750
It might be a different story if there was a book about curing capacity.

06:37.410 --> 06:41.670
But we Christa. No, Historia Reiss ...

06:41.670 --> 06:44.630
Perhaps we will learn the history of the walls through her?

06:45.840 --> 06:49.220
I read the entire report concerning his education

06:50.510 --> 06:55.190
It is the illegitimate daughter of Lord Reiss, and is not a happy story.

06:56.600 --> 07:02.490
But the real mystery here is why ... a simple Regional gentleman would know the secrets of the wall.

07:14.410 --> 07:15.140
They were!

07:15.870 --> 07:17.700
You should still be in bed!

07:17.700 --> 07:21.010
I'm fine. I've slept an entire day.

07:21.620 --> 07:26.590
Also, it is my fault that the strategy to regain the Wall Maria was shelved.

07:26.590 --> 07:27.920
It's not your fault.

07:28.420 --> 07:29.690
So do not worry.

07:30.590 --> 07:34.930
All that interests me ... is to have a chance to fight the giant beast.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.640
Whatever it is that damn monkey, I'll never forgive you.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.150
It can now change the lookout.

07:48.730 --> 07:49.650
Mikasa?

07:49.990 --> 07:51.110
Yup.

07:54.990 --> 07:56.160
It must be nice.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.310
You and the other ... you have in mind the objectives, although it will not be easy.

08:01.870 --> 08:06.880
But I now that Ymir is gone ... I do not know what I want.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.050
But you did not want to save Ymir?

08:10.090 --> 08:12.170
If my ...

08:13.010 --> 08:17.260
Then, I could not believe what I had done ... However, it is true that I wanted to save her.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.060
But now, I think differently.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.690
Ymir has chosen his path in life.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.120
I do not have the right to cambiarlela ... and not have to.

08:30.940 --> 08:34.110
Finally, you're talking again.

08:34.110 --> 08:35.030
Eh?

08:35.409 --> 08:38.780
When we came here, you told us everything about you, but ...

08:38.780 --> 08:42.909
since then, you did not smile once, and rarely have spoken.

08:43.620 --> 08:44.670
Because it hurts.

08:46.670 --> 08:47.570
Sorry.

08:48.340 --> 08:52.590
Christa, the girl who was kind to everyone, no longer exists.

08:53.010 --> 08:56.220
Nah, I think it's better that way.

08:56.220 --> 08:56.720
Eh?

08:57.010 --> 08:59.730
Before, I felt like I was talking with a mask.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.600
It was so forced and unnatural, it made me feel uncomfortable.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.600
I see.

09:05.890 --> 09:08.860
But now you're finally normal.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.170
A girl stupidly honest, but normal.

09:13.070 --> 09:16.240
However, we will have a lot time to think about Ymir.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.280
In many ways, I ...

09:20.830 --> 09:22.580
Wait ... it was not ...?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.410
Hange and the others arrive!

09:25.410 --> 09:27.290
Gather everyone in the main room!

09:30.840 --> 09:32.710
Eh? What happened?

09:34.380 --> 09:36.930
He died ... The Nick Shepherd.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.140
He's been killed.

09:40.550 --> 09:43.050
This morning, in the barracks of Trost.

09:49.690 --> 09:50.440
Hey!

09:50.440 --> 09:52.520
Contaminate the crime scene, cursed Scout!

09:52.980 --> 09:54.740
Do not come.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.780
This is our job, not yours.

09:57.360 --> 10:01.700
It's another murder-robbery. They are popping up a lot lately.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.950
Wha ...?! I do not buy this!

10:03.950 --> 10:05.540
Her fingernails were ripped!

10:05.790 --> 10:07.500
Which unit are you?

10:10.500 --> 10:15.050
The commander of the Fourth Section and chief mate ZoÃ« Hange Moblit Berner.

10:16.010 --> 10:20.840
Your ranks mean nothing in a place like this.

10:21.550 --> 10:25.310
Listen to me ... This man certainly was not killed by a giant.

10:25.310 --> 10:27.430
One person killed another person.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.560
This work is out of your jurisdiction.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.730
Before internal team?

10:35.780 --> 10:40.380
Because? Because the military police in the capital dropped to Trost?

10:41.030 --> 10:42.910
What's wrong with that?

10:43.660 --> 10:48.200
Unlike you useless gorilla, we soldiers are committed to work things out.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.960
Oh! So that's it!

10:52.330 --> 10:55.090
You're right, they are really unnecessary.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.880
I'm so lucky to have met great soldiers like you.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.590
Let me shake your hand!

11:00.470 --> 11:03.380
I see ... So the poor Nick was robbed ...

11:03.930 --> 11:05.210
What a pity...

11:05.850 --> 11:09.230
Has she had things that were worth stealing?

11:09.230 --> 11:10.520
Obviously.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.770
Everyone knows that the Church pendants are made of precious metals.

11:13.980 --> 11:14.520
Eh?!

11:15.150 --> 11:18.280
Nick was a pastor of the Order of the walls ?!

11:19.320 --> 11:20.860
What are you talking about?

11:21.240 --> 11:23.810
It was my friend in personal terms ...

11:24.490 --> 11:29.250
But, for all I knew, the man was only a manufacturer of chairs.

11:29.250 --> 11:32.080
I even wrote a recommendation for him here ...

11:32.080 --> 11:32.960
Damn it, stop ...

11:32.960 --> 11:38.920
Anyway, I guess I did not know Nick as I thought ...

11:38.920 --> 11:40.840
Hey! Let me go!

11:40.840 --> 11:43.010
Oh sorry! Forgive me!

11:44.300 --> 11:47.070
Well then, good luck with the investigation.

11:47.510 --> 11:50.430
When will capture the culprit, please could you say you ...

11:51.020 --> 11:55.440
"The things that you did, maybe you thought you were right."

11:55.440 --> 11:58.900
"But personally, he could care less."

11:59.280 --> 12:03.570
"To you rascals, I will make sure that you are tortured lives as my friend,"

12:03.570 --> 12:06.990
"And you will experience the same suffering, if not much more."

12:06.990 --> 12:08.910
Yes, you will regret it!

12:09.370 --> 12:12.310
Pass them this message. Please.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.720
Commander not really think they ...?

12:21.720 --> 12:25.050
Yes ... First internal team, Djel Sannes.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.550
The skin of the hand was all split.

12:27.550 --> 12:30.520
Nick was tortured by military police inside ...

12:31.270 --> 12:32.760
And then murdered ...

12:35.690 --> 12:40.620
I imagined that the Church would have liked to deal with Nick since he was working with the Scouts.

12:41.280 --> 12:45.950
And that's why I hid his identity and they did remain in the barracks, but ...

12:45.950 --> 12:48.370
To think that they would use soldiers to kill him ...

12:49.280 --> 12:51.120
I was too careless.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.960
It's all my fault.

12:58.540 --> 13:05.220
The military police tortured ... Pastor Nick just to find out what information he passed on to us?

13:05.220 --> 13:06.260
Most likely.

13:06.930 --> 13:12.280
But it was the internal military police, which means that there is something else behind.

13:12.770 --> 13:15.640
So, how many nails they ripped?

13:15.810 --> 13:16.600
Eh?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.770
You see, right? How much it is?

13:18.770 --> 13:23.490
I only caught a glimpse, but I seem to have lost all nails.

13:23.650 --> 13:28.980
People who talk do it right away. If they do not, other tear it makes no difference.

13:30.160 --> 13:33.500
Pastor Nick ... I thought he was an idiot, but ...

13:34.580 --> 13:38.340
until the end, he has not turned his back on what he thought.

13:42.170 --> 13:46.950
In other words, they have no idea that we sensed something about the Reiss family.

13:47.720 --> 13:53.090
However, the activism of the government is not any good, and now have their eyes on us.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.520
Captain Levi.

13:56.230 --> 13:58.020
A message from Commander Erwin.

13:59.810 --> 14:04.160
I went to talk to the pastor Nick, but he sent me away with this.

14:05.030 --> 14:07.490
All out. Let's start now.

14:07.990 --> 14:09.660
Do not leave traces of our presence.

14:16.710 --> 14:17.960
We went close ...

14:18.460 --> 14:21.960
If it had gone, what would happen?

14:21.960 --> 14:24.460
But why? How did the commander Erwin to ...?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.260
New orders from the government.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.140
There was a freeze on all Scout activities outside the walls.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.340
There are imposing to deliver Eren e Historia.

14:35.770 --> 14:38.730
By the way, even after they handed me the message ...

14:39.270 --> 14:41.430
... military police came for him ...

14:45.440 --> 14:47.680
I treat it as a kind of criminal!

14:48.030 --> 14:50.470
Someone is coming out of the shadows.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.950
They're moving there for everyone.

14:52.950 --> 14:55.970
All to protect the secrets of the walls ...

14:56.500 --> 15:00.470
Also, because we want to deliver and Eren Historia?

15:01.080 --> 15:04.090
Do not kill them, but for what?

15:04.460 --> 15:05.350
Who knows?

15:06.130 --> 15:09.150
However, it is clear that the enemy is behind these two.

15:09.930 --> 15:12.220
Hanging out here is dangerous.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.900
I will move to the Eren Trost District.

15:15.970 --> 15:19.400
Because? It is the same place where Pastor Nick was killed.

15:19.850 --> 15:22.030
Head towards the inside is worse.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.520
With Trost panicked, it should be easier to sneak.

15:25.980 --> 15:29.570
And if someone individuasse us, we can use these in the city.

15:30.150 --> 15:30.930
Vero...

15:31.320 --> 15:34.360
Also, do not know the enemy puts us in a difficult situation.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.410
We must find out who is behind all this.

15:38.620 --> 15:41.500
Hange, lend someone your team.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.540
Obviously.

15:44.590 --> 15:47.380
Okay, I'm going to try Erwin.

15:47.710 --> 15:51.430
Moblit is with me. The rest of you will follow Levi.

15:51.430 --> 15:51.970
Roger!

15:53.930 --> 15:54.910
Procurement!

15:56.010 --> 15:56.790
Garment...

15:58.060 --> 16:01.390
I was reminded of a conversation between Ymir and Bertholdt.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.310
I have not had time to tell you, but it is written all.

16:05.650 --> 16:06.650
All right.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.360
After going to give them a look.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.530
à¤ƒiyah!

16:17.200 --> 16:19.540
They moved pretty quickly.

16:19.540 --> 16:23.960
Hmph ... It 'because the little bastard is quite organized.

16:24.790 --> 16:26.180
An acquaintance of yours?

16:27.460 --> 16:28.340
One longstanding.

16:28.960 --> 16:33.970
"Current Information undisclosed" "Giants Body"

16:28.960 --> 16:33.970
"The body of each Gigante varies significantly, but each has a weak point one meter long and 10 cm wide in the neck similar to a human dimension in the direct spinal cord to the brain. When this area is cut fades the regenerative capacity of Giant resulting destruction. it is thought that this vital organ, the source of their being, is nothing more than the remains of a human being. "

16:43.230 --> 16:46.460
Try not to walk in groups. They would notice.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.690
Eren e Historia, walk normally.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.110
Why is the flag of the royal family hanging everywhere?

16:53.110 --> 16:56.410
Oh! Today must be the anniversary of the coronation of the king.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.450
Once a year, they distribute a handful of supplies.

16:59.450 --> 17:00.120
Oh...

17:00.120 --> 17:02.200
We will begin to distribute the supplies!

17:03.540 --> 17:09.190
Fritz King heard about the difficulties of Trost District and will donate the reserves of the royal family!

17:10.300 --> 17:13.380
There's enough for everyone! Align with order!

17:13.380 --> 17:13.970
Thank God!

17:13.970 --> 17:15.680
- Long live King Fritz! - Thank God!

17:16.140 --> 17:18.970
That king! It is really generous!

17:18.970 --> 17:20.920
It has a lot more than it actually needs.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.180
People are weak, especially when it comes to food.

17:30.320 --> 17:34.240
By distributing these rations, over 60% of the supplies went.

17:35.030 --> 17:39.950
Do not you think it's a bit 'too much to raise the morale of the people, Lord Reiss?

17:39.950 --> 17:45.460
It is necessary. There was a need to raise public approval to the royal family.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.420
More importantly, we need the power and through.

17:48.420 --> 17:50.210
And we have to hurry.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.210
The military police has failed again?

17:54.210 --> 17:56.590
When I return I will continue the hunt.

17:57.180 --> 17:59.710
No, we will soon have what we need.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.070
"He" was set in motion.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.360
Beware! Behind us!

18:24.160 --> 18:24.950
Weapons--

18:24.950 --> 18:27.370
I mean, Christa and Eren!

18:27.370 --> 18:29.980
They were kidnapped again!

18:35.670 --> 18:37.130
really work?

18:38.300 --> 18:41.180
It has absolutely looks like ...

18:42.140 --> 18:44.470
That horse face? Yeah, for sure...

18:49.100 --> 18:53.730
Yes? You like this? Let me hear you moan.

18:53.730 --> 18:58.070
Well? Like this? Are not you excited?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.700
I'm dying to hear your little voice.

19:07.410 --> 19:10.540
This is why I did not want to spend all this shit again!

19:11.380 --> 19:12.920
To hell do the stunt!

19:12.920 --> 19:15.710
It is more muscular than I expected ...

19:21.640 --> 19:23.110
How's it going in there?

19:23.760 --> 19:27.020
If we do not hurry, we notice the disguise of Armin.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.790
And I'm sorry for him ...

19:30.230 --> 19:31.250
I see.

19:32.350 --> 19:34.610
How's the leg? Better?

19:35.900 --> 19:38.620
I can move pretty well. It's not that bad.

19:39.360 --> 19:44.190
Most importantly, these kidnappers ... They are nothing but amateurs.

19:44.910 --> 19:47.280
Why they should use types like these?

19:48.870 --> 19:52.920
You can handle the rest alone. I'm going to Eren.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.340
Once you've dealt with the junk, come and meet me.

19:56.340 --> 19:57.130
Roger.

19:58.010 --> 20:01.620
Another thing ... ln case of any eventuality.

20:02.890 --> 20:04.450
Tell also to Armin and others.

20:18.320 --> 20:21.740
Are you sure, no doubt, who are Christa and Eren?

20:21.740 --> 20:24.240
Yes, they fit the description.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.940
Eh? Where's the guard?

20:38.210 --> 20:38.710
What--?!

20:44.890 --> 20:46.800
Do not you dare move.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.850
Conny! They are really only four ?!

20:52.140 --> 20:53.600
Yes, it is!

20:53.940 --> 20:55.460
No one else in the area!

20:59.320 --> 21:02.400
If you move again, who knows where I strike?

21:02.400 --> 21:06.870
All right! First we tie them here and then we meet with the captain.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.160
What do you mean?

21:08.160 --> 21:10.960
The captain's orders, and also sends a message.

21:15.370 --> 21:17.600
Hey! Get out of the way!

21:21.300 --> 21:22.130
Captain.

21:22.590 --> 21:23.300
Then?

21:23.920 --> 21:26.390
The road is busy, but nothing unusual.

21:26.970 --> 21:29.580
We are not much farther away Pyxis commander.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.520
What is the mission of the stunt?

21:31.930 --> 21:32.950
A success.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.810
Yet, it does not seem so excited ...

21:36.190 --> 21:37.140
No...

21:38.480 --> 21:39.920
Something does not ...

21:40.480 --> 21:42.650
The military police can not be behind this.

21:43.150 --> 21:46.850
They're too cocky. They would use the amateur.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.220
It 'more like ...

21:50.410 --> 21:52.740
Assuming that the cart has been followed ...

21:53.830 --> 21:56.290
And that a group was following their goal ...

21:56.290 --> 21:57.160
Captain.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.010
The wagon is almost moving again.

22:01.750 --> 22:04.580
Nifa, have you ever heard of Kenny the Ripper?

22:05.010 --> 22:07.130
The mass murderess in the capital?

22:07.720 --> 22:10.680
The one who cut the throat of more than 100 military?

22:10.680 --> 22:14.560
It 'just a legend metropolitan years old, right?

22:14.560 --> 22:17.480
He is real, like the stories about him.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.110
Eh?

22:18.650 --> 22:21.480
I lived with him for a period when I was a child.

22:21.650 --> 22:24.080
What? Why are you telling me all this?

22:24.570 --> 22:26.150
This is not the time to make jokes.

22:27.070 --> 22:31.160
That's right ... not affect the use of the amateurs.

22:31.950 --> 22:36.410
If a group was following the target, they would have done from both rear corners, and ...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.020
... from a high place, with a good view ...

22:41.790 --> 22:42.630
Nifa!

23:04.320 --> 23:06.510
I saw it.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.960
You're not grown up yet?

23:30.010 --> 23:33.470
Oh? It looks like you're not changed a bit!

23:35.180 --> 23:36.970
Kenny!

23:40.940 --> 23:43.090
Kenny and Levi meet again.

23:43.610 --> 23:46.650
The goal of the enemy was Eren e Historia.

23:47.610 --> 23:52.430
In order to get them back, Levi and others must take aim and shoot.

23:52.990 --> 23:56.540
