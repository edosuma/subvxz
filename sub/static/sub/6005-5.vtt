00:10.775 --> 00:13.653
Hello, Peter, it's Geoffrey Barkway.

00:14.172 --> 00:16.254
I wonder if you are available.

00:16.295 --> 00:20.083
I'd like you to speak at my conference
on human justice.

00:21.695 --> 00:24.209
Tell me honestly,
does my bum look big in this?

00:24.255 --> 00:26.166
I prefer the pinstripe.

00:26.215 --> 00:29.336
Now, ties. What about classic green

00:29.346 --> 00:31.787
or this rather happening yellow number?

00:31.797 --> 00:32.975
What do we think?

00:32.985 --> 00:35.644
If you don't get a move on
you'll miss the conference.

00:35.918 --> 00:37.686
All right!

00:37.735 --> 00:38.929
OK.

00:39.199 --> 00:42.100
You have yourself
a very, very well-deserved holiday.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.929
Thank you, I will.
I hope the speech goes well.

00:44.975 --> 00:45.865
Thanks.

00:46.387 --> 00:51.131
Lyle, don't forget the good name
of Kingdom & Kingdom lies in your hands.

00:51.175 --> 00:54.372
And in Scott's.
You may need to be quite firm.

00:54.415 --> 00:56.690
Don't worry, cometh the hour,
cometh the man,

00:56.735 --> 00:58.726
and I ameth the man.

00:59.141 --> 01:01.573
Ahoy, shipmates!

01:01.615 --> 01:03.606
- Bon voyage, Mr Snell.
- Wait for me!

01:05.015 --> 01:08.803
- What are you doing?
- I wouldn't want to miss the party, would I?

01:08.855 --> 01:11.972
It's a conference, Simon,
a serious conference.

01:12.015 --> 01:14.131
(Starts car)

01:15.295 --> 01:19.447
I'd like to begin by welcoming you
to this keynote presentation

01:19.495 --> 01:24.064
on the essentially universal subject
of human justice.

01:24.262 --> 01:28.133
Given by a small-town solicitor
from Market Shipborough.

02:09.294 --> 02:10.933
(Bicycle bell rings)

02:35.506 --> 02:37.845
And remember, best behaviour, Simon.

02:37.895 --> 02:39.851
Ah, Peter!

02:40.459 --> 02:42.568
Susan, you remember Peter
Kingdom, don't you?

02:42.615 --> 02:45.527
Yes, of course! How very nice to see you again.

02:45.575 --> 02:47.394
And you, Mrs Barkway.

02:47.404 --> 02:50.209
Um, go ahead, my dear,
I'll be along shortly.

02:50.694 --> 02:52.052
Hello, Mrs Barkway.

02:52.556 --> 02:56.566
And Simon! Something of a surprise.
I heard you were dead.

02:56.615 --> 03:00.290
- Funny, I heard the same about you.
- No, no, no, very much of the living.

03:00.536 --> 03:03.805
Well, "As a dog returneth to his vomit,"
I suppose.

03:04.728 --> 03:08.444
Um, Professor, I was rather hoping
we might discuss my speech.

03:08.495 --> 03:12.249
Of course, of course.
I've had the porters prepare your old rooms.

03:12.295 --> 03:14.206
Come and see me when you've unpacked.

03:16.535 --> 03:18.526
(Hums happily)

03:30.215 --> 03:32.206
(Rock music blares)

03:35.215 --> 03:36.933
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

03:38.695 --> 03:40.079
(Music off)
- Keep the noise down.

03:40.089 --> 03:43.725
This is a place of work and I'm in charge,
so you do as I say.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.243
- Mind if I make some calls?
- Whatever.

03:46.862 --> 03:48.286
No sex lines.

03:49.695 --> 03:53.404
PROFESSOR BARKWAY: Janet, please,
we must discuss this sensibly.

03:53.969 --> 03:56.541
Janet, please, the research.

03:56.551 --> 03:58.934
Look, you can't keep running away.

04:00.455 --> 04:03.970
Come on, Janet, be reasonable.
We have a duty to resolve this.

04:04.015 --> 04:07.610
- It's for the good of the college.
- We both know it's nothing of the sort!

04:09.055 --> 04:10.807
You'll get nothing from me.

04:15.295 --> 04:17.331
Scott? Coffee!

04:17.375 --> 04:19.075
Black, two sugars.

04:19.084 --> 04:22.213
- Try rebooting the whole system.
(Another phone rings)

04:22.255 --> 04:24.530
- Luke Skywalker mug.
- OK, I'll call you back.

04:25.239 --> 04:26.835
And a custard cream.

04:27.305 --> 04:29.850
(Rock music)

04:30.775 --> 04:33.372
Scott, will you keep the noise down!

04:33.382 --> 04:35.492
(Music off)
- Get your own coffee.

04:35.535 --> 04:37.526
I'm not your slave.

04:37.575 --> 04:39.611
(Gentle chimes)

04:42.099 --> 04:43.931
- Sherry?
- Thank you.

04:43.975 --> 04:47.411
Dinner tonight at High Table
and tomorrow we start the conference

04:47.455 --> 04:49.446
bright and early at ten.

04:50.233 --> 04:53.852
The college has suffered something
of a minor tragedy.

04:54.975 --> 04:57.205
Three weeks ago, Dr Mary Goodyear,

04:57.255 --> 04:59.450
head of our biology department,

04:59.495 --> 05:03.966
died while on a marine expedition
in the South Pacific.

05:04.324 --> 05:05.573
Yes, I read about it.

05:05.615 --> 05:10.052
Dr Goodyear's research
was of the very first order, you understand.

05:10.095 --> 05:13.007
But when I came to examine her papers
after her death,

05:13.055 --> 05:17.765
it soon became clear that sections
of the research were missing.

05:17.815 --> 05:19.974
Goodness! What, you mean stolen?

05:19.984 --> 05:21.606
No, no, no, no, nothing like that.

05:21.655 --> 05:26.775
It's this bloody librarian, Janet Cramer.

05:27.184 --> 05:30.330
- And she is?
- Dr Goodyear's partner.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.890
- Research partner?
- Good Lord, no, she's not got the brains for that.

05:33.935 --> 05:35.687
Her lesbian life partner.

05:36.855 --> 05:39.749
It turns out Janet Cramer's got
the bulk of the research

05:39.759 --> 05:42.808
squirreled away somewhere
and won't give it back.

05:42.855 --> 05:45.085
<i>Says it's hers, not ours.</i>

05:46.161 --> 05:48.647
I really can't be dealing with these people,
you know.

05:48.695 --> 05:50.413
What, lesbians?

05:50.658 --> 05:52.093
Librarians.

05:52.293 --> 05:52.931
Oh.

05:52.975 --> 05:56.445
Awful, small-minded, orderly,
finicketty little nobodies,

05:56.495 --> 05:59.851
stuck away in their dusty,
desiccated bloody towers.

06:00.494 --> 06:03.808
That research has to be returned
to its rightful place.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.732
It's for the good of the college.

06:06.416 --> 06:10.690
Scientists have been waiting two decades
for it to be published.

06:11.215 --> 06:13.899
I've tried to reason with her
but she won't listen to me.

06:13.909 --> 06:16.974
Thinks I'm some antiquated ogre.

06:18.268 --> 06:20.571
But she might listen to you.

06:20.949 --> 06:22.567
I see...

06:22.953 --> 06:28.084
Tell me, when exactly does your nomination
for Master come up?

06:28.935 --> 06:30.370
Peter!

06:31.087 --> 06:33.887
SCOTT: Being a lawyer's easy,
there's nothing to do.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.846
You and I need to have a little chat.

06:38.215 --> 06:40.206
Someone to see you.

06:42.175 --> 06:43.893
- <i>Good morning.</i>
- It's my cats.

06:43.935 --> 06:46.608
They need to be looked after when I'm gone.

06:46.655 --> 06:49.169
- Right. Come through.
(Phone rings)

06:50.392 --> 06:52.924
Don't worry, boss, I'll hold your calls.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.047
Have a seat, Mrs erm?

06:56.095 --> 06:59.690
- Er... Compton!
- We'll see what we can do for you.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.612
Maybe we could set up a trust fund
so they're provided for.

07:03.979 --> 07:06.206
- What?
- A trust fund.

07:06.519 --> 07:08.849
So that they are provided for.

07:08.859 --> 07:11.609
Of course they are!
Every morning, regular.

07:11.726 --> 07:16.690
Minnie has her milk warmed
but Sandrine doesn't.

07:16.947 --> 07:19.329
Fresh from the fridge
or she turns her nose up at it.

07:19.375 --> 07:22.651
The boys have their Crackles
in the morning

07:22.695 --> 07:25.812
and the ladies in the afternoon,
and that is important,

07:25.855 --> 07:28.591
and you should write this down, young man.
Use your mouse.

07:28.601 --> 07:31.614
Mrs Compton, I understand.

07:32.104 --> 07:34.453
Leave it with me.

07:42.055 --> 07:44.046
(Knocks on door)

08:02.805 --> 08:03.623
Hi.

08:05.320 --> 08:08.633
Tell me something, Peter,
when did this Mary Goodyear die, exactly?

08:08.685 --> 08:11.627
- Three weeks ago.
- The same time Barkway invited you

08:11.637 --> 08:13.196
to speak at his conference.

08:22.405 --> 08:24.666
Thank you, and good morning.

08:24.885 --> 08:29.197
And welcome all
to our conference on human justice.

08:29.605 --> 08:32.073
Bunking off class? That isn't like you.

08:32.885 --> 08:36.001
- Going to a rave or something?
- No, the library.

08:38.365 --> 08:41.335
- Miss Cramer, please...
- <i>Let me get this straight.</i>

08:41.345 --> 08:45.686
Barkway has seen that intimidating me
personally doesn't work.

08:45.696 --> 08:49.597
So now he's sent his poodle
to do the job instead.

08:49.645 --> 08:52.260
Really, Miss Cramer, I am nobody's poodle.

08:52.270 --> 08:55.043
Flat-coated retriever, possibly,
but poodle, no!

08:55.085 --> 08:56.564
Professor Barkway merely...

08:56.605 --> 08:59.802
Barkway doesn't have a leg to stand on
and he knows it.

09:00.038 --> 09:03.758
Mary left the work to me. All of it.

09:04.285 --> 09:07.197
- What, she put that in her will?
- Of course.

09:07.925 --> 09:10.075
The funeral was four days ago.

09:10.685 --> 09:12.676
We buried an empty coffin.

09:13.041 --> 09:15.444
- Were you there?
- No.

09:15.485 --> 09:17.760
No, because you didn't know her.

09:18.265 --> 09:21.480
Let alone spend 15 years of shared life with her.

09:21.525 --> 09:24.769
And yet here you are, demanding her work,
demanding her papers,

09:24.779 --> 09:27.649
anything she left behind.
"Come on, hand it over!"

09:27.659 --> 09:31.156
As if it's your right! It isn't!

09:32.605 --> 09:34.596
Is that clear?

09:35.791 --> 09:37.236
Very clear.

09:39.165 --> 09:42.362
Miss Cramer, we've clearly got off
on the wrong foot here.

09:42.807 --> 09:46.444
Poodle or no, all we wanted was a chat.

09:47.372 --> 09:49.680
Maybe we could have one over a cup of tea.

09:50.404 --> 09:53.114
With buns? Cake?

09:53.713 --> 09:54.809
Cream?

09:56.904 --> 09:58.261
I know a place.

10:00.223 --> 10:03.802
Mr Matthews, thank you for bringing it round.
I'll be right with you.

10:03.812 --> 10:07.158
- How come it looks like it's melted?
- It's a G-Wizz.

10:07.205 --> 10:09.196
Well, gee whizz.

10:09.245 --> 10:11.315
It's an electric car. Totally green.

10:11.365 --> 10:13.754
Zero carbon footprint after manufacture.

10:14.150 --> 10:15.602
It looks like a handbag.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.636
Bet it really pulls the birds.

10:17.989 --> 10:21.015
I'm going out.
You stay here and do absolutely nothing.

10:21.025 --> 10:23.714
(Mobile rings)
- Just a minute. Hello.

10:23.765 --> 10:25.756
Millington Tech Support.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.862
- Make yourself comfortable, my boy.
- Oh, yes!

10:29.872 --> 10:32.002
There we are. Ho-ho!

10:34.599 --> 10:36.760
It's driving like a dream, Mr Matthews.

10:49.998 --> 10:53.197
Like most people of genius,
Mary had a grand theory.

10:53.678 --> 10:55.156
So... Thank you.

10:55.676 --> 11:00.560
Mary spent 20 years
trying to model plankton population,

11:00.570 --> 11:06.124
so that we could work towards
re-seeding the deserted areas of the ocean.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.465
You're talking about fish food.

11:09.590 --> 11:15.079
Plankton can also absorb carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, Mr Kingdom.

11:15.489 --> 11:18.754
Re-seed even a fraction of the Pacific

11:18.805 --> 11:22.320
and you could stop global warming in its tracks.

11:24.485 --> 11:26.734
- Reverse it.
- Gosh!

11:26.744 --> 11:30.803
Gosh! That is why Barkway wants
to get his hooks into it.

11:31.645 --> 11:33.556
But, Miss Cramer...

11:33.605 --> 11:37.678
Oh, please call me Janet,
since you are buying me cakes and everything.

11:38.236 --> 11:43.402
Janet, all Professor Barkway intends
is to publish Mary's research.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.528
Isn't that exactly what she would have wanted?

11:45.538 --> 11:49.355
Don't you think I'm a better judge of that
than anyone else?

11:49.524 --> 11:51.521
So, you're going to publish it yourself?

11:51.565 --> 11:53.556
- No.
- Why not?

11:53.827 --> 11:56.199
That's really none of your business.

11:57.365 --> 11:59.356
(Tractor horn plays Dixie)

12:00.005 --> 12:03.918
Just pull over here, Mr Anderson,
and let's talk a little business.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.842
What about instalments?
I could maybe find a deposit.

12:16.852 --> 12:19.357
No, these things are selling like hot cakes.

12:19.367 --> 12:21.556
I don't really do credit.

12:22.003 --> 12:26.078
Look, you're a lawyer, right, like Mr Kingdom?

12:26.278 --> 12:27.558
That's right, yes.

12:27.605 --> 12:31.757
My son David and his girlfriend
are looking to buy their own place,

12:31.805 --> 12:34.194
and I was thinking I might like to help them,

12:34.245 --> 12:36.236
by lending them the money.

12:36.246 --> 12:37.781
Very generous spirited of you.

12:37.791 --> 12:42.863
So, look, why don't you do me
a nice quick loan agreement, watertight,

12:42.873 --> 12:45.001
and I will let you buy a Whizz.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.561
An agreement that David can't get out of,
that ties him down.

12:49.605 --> 12:53.314
If you want the car,
I'm the only one round here who can help you.

12:53.890 --> 12:55.955
So, you'll be wanting to say yes.

12:57.871 --> 12:59.796
It's a deal!

13:00.805 --> 13:02.602
(Hums happily)

13:02.645 --> 13:05.239
Yeah, mate, just click Accept and you're done.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.402
The PayPal account's Millington Consultants.
OK, bye.

13:08.939 --> 13:11.268
- What are you doing?
(Sighs) I need a Wii.

13:11.278 --> 13:13.395
What? No-one's stopping you.

13:13.445 --> 13:17.040
No, a Nintendo Wii.
Seventh generation games console.

13:17.462 --> 13:20.282
But it's pricey, so I need to make some cash.

13:20.325 --> 13:22.361
- Doing what?
- Tech support.

13:22.405 --> 13:24.555
"Too thick or old to work your PC?

13:24.870 --> 13:26.994
Millington Associates are here to help."

13:27.045 --> 13:28.645
Not out of this office.

13:28.655 --> 13:31.609
It could be worth your while. I could cut you in.

13:31.619 --> 13:34.399
No way. You need a Whizz, I need a Wii.

13:34.445 --> 13:39.075
That's a perfect match.
Lovely melty car could be all yours.

13:43.645 --> 13:46.205
All right. But my cut comes off the top.

13:46.245 --> 13:48.554
No more loud music and you make the coffee.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.196
- Deal?
- Done!

13:51.467 --> 13:53.904
Of course she's going to publish it herself.

13:53.914 --> 13:55.866
Well, she seemed very clear that she wasn't.

13:55.876 --> 13:59.122
- And you believed her?
- That is neither here nor there.

13:59.132 --> 14:01.133
Legally, she can do what she likes.

14:01.143 --> 14:04.180
Dr Goodyear's will
leaves all the research to her.

14:04.190 --> 14:06.516
Then we must contest the will.

14:07.171 --> 14:09.754
This is the curse of the ethical being, Peter.

14:10.102 --> 14:13.718
The papers should be published.
They could be published if we had them.

14:14.010 --> 14:18.005
Another man would simply take them
and cut the Gordian knot in a moment.

14:18.015 --> 14:20.080
- Uh...
- And yet our own ethics,

14:20.125 --> 14:23.800
our code of conduct forces us to do nothing.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.874
If only... if only there was another way!

14:33.792 --> 14:36.400
There's the matter of you pulling your weight.

14:36.445 --> 14:39.278
Time for Millington & Anderson to diversify.

14:39.325 --> 14:42.556
Anderson & Millington,
and I've already had an idea, actually.

14:43.025 --> 14:46.075
Free quotation on our
will preparation service.

14:46.125 --> 14:48.099
This week only, no appointment necessary.

14:48.109 --> 14:50.833
- Quarter page in the local paper.
- I like!

14:50.885 --> 14:52.443
(Phone rings)

14:52.485 --> 14:55.070
Anderson & Millington,
how may I direct your call?

14:55.080 --> 14:58.835
Hello, Scott? Lyle? I'm sorry, who is this?

14:58.885 --> 15:02.400
Er, it's Scott. Sorry, it's a bad line.

15:02.651 --> 15:06.279
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, everything's fine. Got to go!

15:06.325 --> 15:08.316
(Dial tone)

15:13.203 --> 15:15.144
(Owl hoots)

15:17.673 --> 15:20.036
(Hums to classical music)

15:43.005 --> 15:44.996
Mm.

15:59.814 --> 16:02.604
- Oh, where have you been?
- Oh, out on the tiles.

16:04.070 --> 16:07.237
And I had a little look around
Janet Cramer's rooms.

16:07.479 --> 16:08.718
Simon!

16:08.765 --> 16:11.677
Just, you know,
to see if I could cut the Gordian knot.

16:11.725 --> 16:15.274
By breaking and entering?!
Oh, that's what we do now, is it?

16:15.325 --> 16:18.116
Not breaking and entering,
more easing and entering.

16:18.126 --> 16:22.358
That's not the point.
The missing research wasn't there, but this was.

16:23.697 --> 16:25.956
Mary Goodyear's will.

16:26.565 --> 16:29.955
Don't worry, it's a photocopy.
Cramer won't know.

16:29.965 --> 16:34.716
That is so far from being my objection
to what you've done here, Simon.

16:35.133 --> 16:37.359
There's no mention of research.

16:38.692 --> 16:41.558
No mention of intellectual property.

16:41.841 --> 16:44.039
The will says nothing about these things.

16:44.085 --> 16:46.076
Janet Cramer's been lying to us.

17:04.165 --> 17:04.867
(lntercom buzzes)

17:06.595 --> 17:07.805
Yes?

17:07.962 --> 17:11.123
<i>Someone to see you.</i>
<i>Have you seen our PayPal account?</i>

17:11.165 --> 17:13.554
Not bad. Not bad at all.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.996
You! You're Kingdom?

17:18.586 --> 17:19.523
Er?

17:19.565 --> 17:21.442
You are what kind of an idiot?

17:21.983 --> 17:23.921
You come along and all is ruined!

17:23.931 --> 17:26.598
You cheap arse-bastard!

17:26.645 --> 17:29.239
- Fantastic!
- I'm sorry, who are you?

17:29.285 --> 17:31.594
I am Ylsa. I am David's girlfriend.

17:31.862 --> 17:35.001
David, whose life you are screwing over,
arse-bastard!

17:35.045 --> 17:37.161
- David?
- David Matthews.

17:37.205 --> 17:39.055
You know, the son of the melty-car salesman.

17:39.065 --> 17:41.361
Yes, David Matthews.

17:41.371 --> 17:44.958
What is this,
with the "Daddy will buy you a house, David.

17:44.968 --> 17:48.237
Here's all the money, David"?
Vad i helvete!

17:48.834 --> 17:50.243
Perhaps you'd like to come into the office.

17:50.253 --> 17:54.440
No, no, no, you silly little man.
There's nothing more to say here.

17:54.485 --> 17:56.476
Faente jaevle!

17:56.525 --> 17:59.198
(Phone rings)
- Anderson & Millington.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.156
<i>Could you hold one moment, please?</i>

18:01.428 --> 18:03.196
Arse-bastard!

18:09.788 --> 18:12.036
You lied to us.

18:12.307 --> 18:13.803
What if I did?

18:14.634 --> 18:17.281
She wanted me to have it, that's all that matters.

18:17.325 --> 18:19.316
I'm sure there must be a...

18:20.064 --> 18:23.517
a nice photograph or something
you could remember her by.

18:23.565 --> 18:27.035
Don't patronise me!
The work is what she was.

18:27.965 --> 18:30.081
Nobody knows it better than I do.

18:30.403 --> 18:33.834
You know her work?
Well, did you help her?

18:34.565 --> 18:36.556
Indexing, cataloguing.

18:37.125 --> 18:40.640
Data analysis. She thought it was boring
but I thought it was...

18:41.247 --> 18:44.439
like reading a really good mystery story.

18:47.108 --> 18:49.356
Now it's all that I have left of her.

18:49.701 --> 18:51.396
It's mine.

18:52.291 --> 18:55.102
If she put nothing down in writing,
I'm afraid the college...

18:55.112 --> 18:56.822
What if she did,

18:57.845 --> 18:59.836
put it down in writing?

19:03.252 --> 19:04.504
Here.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.198
Her own words.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.396
Are you happy now?

19:14.513 --> 19:17.558
(Reads) The whole of the past 20 years
has been for nothing.

19:19.085 --> 19:22.919
Don't let them read it and laugh,
don't let them remember me as a fool.

19:23.313 --> 19:24.956
Please, Janet, burn it.

19:25.005 --> 19:26.996
Burn all of it.

19:27.670 --> 19:28.692
Oh...

19:30.798 --> 19:32.717
The er... accident.

19:33.418 --> 19:37.077
The Pacific was where she spent her life.

19:37.645 --> 19:39.636
She loved it there.

19:40.002 --> 19:41.676
She just...

19:44.565 --> 19:46.556
...chose to stay.

19:53.379 --> 19:55.596
Well, Mr Kingdom...

19:57.685 --> 20:01.598
...do you think Barkway will be so keen
to get his hands on his precious research

20:01.645 --> 20:04.034
when he finds out it's worthless?

20:07.096 --> 20:08.876
- She did what?
- Mm.

20:08.925 --> 20:12.474
It turns out that Mary Goodyear's accident
wasn't so accidental.

20:13.285 --> 20:16.243
She stepped off that boat deliberately.

20:16.542 --> 20:17.843
But why?

20:18.126 --> 20:24.358
Well, the greatest breakthrough
of the last 20 years may not exist.

20:39.052 --> 20:42.282
No. This is neither here nor there.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.204
That research is college property
and it must be returned.

20:46.729 --> 20:49.237
Her wishes are clear, Professor.

20:49.741 --> 20:51.845
She wants it destroyed.

20:51.885 --> 20:55.798
Peter, I go before the nominations committee
for the Mastership at the end of the week.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.698
I need those papers.

20:57.708 --> 21:00.558
If the research is worthless, it's worthless.

21:01.566 --> 21:02.800
But it belongs here.

21:07.685 --> 21:09.676
(Gasps)

21:13.053 --> 21:14.593
(Moans)

21:15.415 --> 21:18.039
There! You feeling much better now, yes?

21:18.085 --> 21:20.076
Oh, definitely.

21:20.125 --> 21:21.444
(Bubbling)

21:21.485 --> 21:23.432
(Light dance music)
- And now your nails.

21:23.536 --> 21:25.289
No, I don't think we need to...

21:25.299 --> 21:28.921
Oh, yes!
Is very fashionable now for men, you see.

21:28.965 --> 21:30.117
OK.

21:33.807 --> 21:36.195
Ylsa, help me out here.

21:36.245 --> 21:39.123
You don't want David's parents
to help you buy a house?

21:39.655 --> 21:42.316
It's not help. It's a trick.

21:42.365 --> 21:45.163
- A trick?
- They offer a lot of money.

21:45.205 --> 21:47.241
Enough to buy a big house.

21:47.476 --> 21:49.500
Patio doors, everything.

21:49.510 --> 21:53.718
- And that's bad because?
- Because we cannot afford to pay that back.

21:53.765 --> 21:58.152
So, ever-so-kind Mr Matthews says
that David can work in his car company.

21:58.162 --> 22:01.114
Be a manager, earn plenty, you see?

22:02.085 --> 22:04.235
And then we are just mouse racing.

22:05.038 --> 22:07.357
You mean you're caught in the rat race.

22:07.899 --> 22:09.396
It's what I said.

22:10.445 --> 22:12.436
(Humming)

22:17.307 --> 22:20.145
Mrs Compton's here, and she's not alone.

22:27.365 --> 22:29.037
(Meowing)

22:34.201 --> 22:37.801
There he is! Such a good boy.

22:38.142 --> 22:40.882
Mrs Compton, you didn't need
to bring them with you.

22:40.925 --> 22:43.020
What am I going to do with them, I said,

22:43.030 --> 22:48.368
and he said, "Leave them all with me, Mrs C,
I'll take care of them."

22:48.378 --> 22:52.718
No, I said leave <i>it</i> with me. I'll take care of <i>it.</i>

22:52.973 --> 22:54.309
The trust fund?

22:54.319 --> 22:59.434
It's such a relief knowing,
when I'm gone, they'll be safe.

22:59.833 --> 23:01.476
It's not long now, you know,

23:01.525 --> 23:03.250
and they'll miss me so.

23:04.713 --> 23:06.643
But I've said my goodbyes.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.517
You be kind to them, my boy,

23:08.565 --> 23:10.556
and bless you.

23:10.605 --> 23:11.965
Bless you!

23:17.161 --> 23:19.832
All right. Erm...
I think we can handle this.

23:19.842 --> 23:21.606
This isn't as bad as it seems.

23:21.616 --> 23:26.204
I am going to go and get kitty litter
and - argh! - Some cat food.

23:26.245 --> 23:28.600
You erm... You hold this.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.111
Erm... Put that...

23:31.121 --> 23:33.794
And erm... think of something.

23:34.125 --> 23:36.116
(Trolley rattles)

23:43.001 --> 23:46.601
So, young man, how is my loan agreement
coming along?

23:46.843 --> 23:48.920
- It's all in hand.
- Yeah?

23:48.965 --> 23:51.240
Let's get it wrapped up, then, shall we?

23:51.285 --> 23:54.880
The sooner it's sorted,
the sooner I can get you an electric car.

24:03.151 --> 24:05.556
(Chuckles)

24:08.245 --> 24:10.236
(Mobile rings)

24:12.485 --> 24:13.480
Hello.

24:15.598 --> 24:17.059
Erm...

24:18.483 --> 24:21.245
Er... Right, wait, wait.

24:22.402 --> 24:24.556
Er... What's the address again?

24:27.864 --> 24:31.118
OK. I'll see you there.

24:33.045 --> 24:35.036
(Sings along to i-Pod)

24:42.085 --> 24:45.122
Mr Anderson. Of Kingdom Solicitors?

24:46.222 --> 24:49.002
I'm David Matthews. Ylsa's boyfriend.

24:49.045 --> 24:51.714
- Hello.
- Look, my break's in a couple of minutes.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.559
I need to talk to you. Could you hang about?

24:54.776 --> 24:55.631
Sure.

24:57.405 --> 24:59.635
We've been saving ever since we met,

24:59.685 --> 25:01.915
but it's never going to be enough,

25:01.965 --> 25:05.435
and without a place of our own,
I can't ask her to marry me, can I?

25:06.845 --> 25:08.836
And then we can't have babies,

25:08.885 --> 25:10.293
and we have to have...

25:10.303 --> 25:13.153
we have to have babies, Mr Anderson,
we really do.

25:13.205 --> 25:14.036
Right.

25:14.621 --> 25:18.158
But with Dad's money it's all so... simple.

25:18.168 --> 25:20.143
But then you'd have to pay it back.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.846
You'd just be... mouse racing.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.156
I know, I know! I...

25:25.205 --> 25:27.196
I don't know what to do!

25:28.125 --> 25:32.004
Look, could you talk to my dad,
try and make him understand? Please?

25:36.245 --> 25:37.793
(Sighs)

25:37.803 --> 25:38.889
Simon?

25:47.891 --> 25:50.998
Simon! You've got my bloody speech!

25:54.392 --> 25:58.195
It's very... lkea.

25:58.384 --> 25:59.449
I know.

26:01.371 --> 26:04.475
Cottage hospitals have a blind spot
when it comes to decor.

26:05.352 --> 26:08.039
So, um, what's involved?

26:09.030 --> 26:12.203
Mainly holding my hand.
Telling me to breathe.

26:12.724 --> 26:16.793
Getting me ice chips.
All women during labour have to have ice chips.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.040
Cutting the cord, if you want to.

26:19.685 --> 26:21.750
Are you squeamish with tripe-ier side of things?

26:21.760 --> 26:23.649
I cleaned a fish once.

26:23.659 --> 26:27.275
You could always go to the butcher's,
ask if you could practise.

26:28.037 --> 26:31.283
Just don't go fainting, OK,
stealing all my thunder.

26:31.676 --> 26:35.355
- You wanted some biscuits?
- Thanks very much, thank you.

26:37.405 --> 26:38.394
(Whimpering)

26:38.445 --> 26:41.164
There you go. The only thing
I can get away with in here.

26:41.605 --> 26:44.324
Bea, are you sure
you wouldn't rather have Peter?

26:44.334 --> 26:48.563
He's... He's much more solid in a crisis.

26:49.407 --> 26:50.847
More reliable.

26:51.035 --> 26:52.277
And I'm...

26:53.898 --> 26:55.277
not.

26:55.325 --> 26:56.675
Oh, I know.

26:58.765 --> 27:00.209
When I came back...

27:01.340 --> 27:04.319
Peter didn't just take me in
and put up with me.

27:05.365 --> 27:07.356
He made me feel like I was important.

27:09.165 --> 27:11.156
Like I was needed.

27:11.685 --> 27:14.245
I didn't know how much I needed to be needed.

27:15.346 --> 27:17.636
Until I was.

27:18.340 --> 27:21.167
- And now I need you.
- You need me?

27:21.334 --> 27:22.284
Yes.

27:24.620 --> 27:27.354
Pager. When it goes off you have to be there.

27:27.364 --> 27:30.398
No excuses this time, OK?
You have to be there.

27:31.405 --> 27:32.223
OK.

27:41.379 --> 27:43.497
- Peter!
- Auriel.

27:43.507 --> 27:48.112
- What on earth are you doing here?
- Having my Anais Nin erotica rebound.

27:48.122 --> 27:51.002
It sees a lot of wear, I'm afraid. And you?

27:51.242 --> 27:53.558
Let's have a cup of tea
and I'll tell you all about it.

27:53.568 --> 27:56.483
Cup of tea, be blowed! This is Cambridge.

28:06.023 --> 28:08.201
You're not very good at this, are you?

28:10.825 --> 28:13.267
Where is Simon when you need him?

28:13.277 --> 28:15.437
Well, something came up, apparently.

28:15.447 --> 28:17.128
Oh, I imagine so.

28:17.138 --> 28:21.314
I wouldn't normally mind
but this time he's gone off with my speech.

28:21.365 --> 28:24.694
Others go through life paying the penalty,
but not Simon, oh no.

28:24.704 --> 28:27.843
- He just strolls blithely through...
- Excuse me!

28:27.885 --> 28:29.762
- Erm, Peter...
- Sowing discord.

28:29.805 --> 28:31.921
- Peter, look out!
- Oh, I'm sorry! Oh!

28:31.965 --> 28:34.877
Oh, crikey, I do apologise. I'm so sorry.

28:34.925 --> 28:37.359
Sorry! He's just a beginner. (Laughs)

28:38.405 --> 28:40.396
You see? You nearly got me in then.

28:41.354 --> 28:45.852
The librarian and this Dr Goodyear,
they're lesbians, you say.

28:45.862 --> 28:46.634
Yes.

28:51.501 --> 28:53.916
I was a lesbian once.

28:54.981 --> 28:56.504
It didn't really take.

29:09.605 --> 29:11.402
(Toy squeaks)

29:21.960 --> 29:23.521
Excuse me.

29:23.565 --> 29:25.556
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

29:27.764 --> 29:30.029
Scott, Peter's going to be back tomorrow.

29:30.039 --> 29:31.890
What the bloody hell's going on?

29:31.900 --> 29:34.697
They keep coming, there's more round the back.

29:37.504 --> 29:41.417
Anderson & Millington. Free will preparation
service, no appointment necessary?

29:41.427 --> 29:45.153
No, no, no. It's just the quotation that's free,
not the service.

29:45.299 --> 29:48.601
- Get them to print a retraction.
- I don't think you can.

29:48.611 --> 29:52.639
- Well, we'll have to.
- But isn't that like breach of contract?

29:53.273 --> 29:54.676
False advertising?

29:55.062 --> 29:57.842
Basically, won't it drop you in the shit with Peter?

29:58.354 --> 29:59.251
What do we do?

30:00.907 --> 30:05.323
I don't care who get it,
as long as none of it go to that bitch!

30:05.805 --> 30:07.705
I think you'd better write some wills.

30:12.231 --> 30:13.170
Peter!

30:13.953 --> 30:18.796
Where have you been and,
more to the point, where's my bloody speech?

30:18.988 --> 30:21.315
Oh, erm... Sorry, I...

30:22.323 --> 30:26.154
I needed to write something down. I'll iron it out.

30:26.497 --> 30:31.555
This research, everybody's dancing around it
like a handbag at an Essex wedding.

30:31.776 --> 30:33.596
It's at the centre of everything.

30:34.374 --> 30:38.639
- I think it's time we took a look.
- Why else do you think I'm here?

30:39.501 --> 30:41.066
G, right.

30:41.577 --> 30:44.803
Yes! Goodyear, you see?

30:44.845 --> 30:46.227
Hidden in plain view.

30:46.237 --> 30:49.716
The last place that Professor Barkway
would ever look is in one of his -

30:49.726 --> 30:53.639
how did he put it? - Dusty,
desiccated bloody libraries.

30:54.996 --> 30:59.114
Um, does this look like marine biology to you?

31:01.013 --> 31:04.158
"My dearest Mary..."
Yada, yada, yada.

31:05.315 --> 31:09.114
Er..."All my love, Godfrey."

31:09.437 --> 31:11.743
No, it's not Godfrey, that's Geoffrey.

31:12.681 --> 31:15.274
This is Professor Barkway's handwriting.

31:15.897 --> 31:18.640
Oh. Just so we're clear on this.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.579
If Mary Goodyear was sleeping with Barkway,

31:21.589 --> 31:24.757
doesn't that make her
about the worst lesbian ever?

31:29.093 --> 31:31.576
Thank you for choosing us
for your will-writing needs.

31:31.586 --> 31:35.793
And do remember she likes her milk tepid,
all right? Thanks. Bye now.

31:38.409 --> 31:40.381
- How many more are there?
- Loads.

31:40.391 --> 31:44.634
Right. Sort them into easy ones
we can do with a form and the tricky ones.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.404
Send the tricky ones in to me.
And remember...

31:47.445 --> 31:49.561
- Nobody leaves here without a cat.
- OK.

31:49.605 --> 31:51.711
Marriage in trouble? Cat's a shared interest.

31:51.721 --> 31:54.257
Farm not doing so well?
Cat keeps down the vermin.

31:54.267 --> 31:56.954
- Stay on message.
- Yeah.

31:57.489 --> 31:59.450
Right, who wants a cat?

32:01.602 --> 32:06.882
Ah, Peter. I must say I'm looking forward
to your keynote speech this afternoon.

32:06.892 --> 32:09.156
Susan and I will be in the front row.

32:09.766 --> 32:12.207
Yes. You don't actually have to humour me

32:12.217 --> 32:15.484
with this fiction about keynote speeches.

32:15.525 --> 32:18.995
We both know perfectly well
why you wanted me here.

32:25.024 --> 32:28.397
Janet Cramer, by the way,
knew nothing about them.

32:28.445 --> 32:32.358
She was still going through the research,
getting up to date.

32:32.405 --> 32:34.396
She had no idea about this.

32:34.445 --> 32:36.436
(Clock chimes gently)

32:37.285 --> 32:39.276
Would you like a sherry, Peter?

32:39.925 --> 32:41.003
Thank you.

32:43.700 --> 32:46.554
I wasn't even sure she would have kept them.

32:46.605 --> 32:49.915
They're love letters, of course, from me to her.

32:50.091 --> 32:50.926
Yes.

32:51.510 --> 32:55.256
Mary and I... It was the '70s, you see.

32:55.371 --> 32:57.403
Well, of course.

32:57.445 --> 33:02.200
The thrill of an illicit liaison for
the married tutor.

33:02.717 --> 33:05.320
A walk on the wrong side of the lesbian tracks

33:05.330 --> 33:06.943
for the feminist biologist.

33:06.953 --> 33:09.236
Neither of us wished it known.

33:09.285 --> 33:11.713
And, frankly, even after all this time,

33:11.723 --> 33:15.684
I thought if the matter was to come to light,
it would be...

33:16.045 --> 33:17.556
Bad for the college?

33:19.421 --> 33:22.323
Yes. Bad for the college.

33:23.765 --> 33:27.314
Well, they're yours.
They have nothing to do with the research.

33:27.365 --> 33:29.356
Nobody knows.

33:32.223 --> 33:35.244
And nobody need ever know.

33:37.377 --> 33:39.675
Pretend it never happened, you mean?

33:42.522 --> 33:44.676
Well, it's one option.

33:44.725 --> 33:46.716
But not the one you'd choose.

33:48.211 --> 33:51.357
You've spent your life
considering right and wrong.

33:51.405 --> 33:54.954
You taught me how to weigh that balance
when I was 19 years old.

33:55.687 --> 33:59.964
You don't need me now to help you
come to a decision about what to do.

34:02.845 --> 34:04.836
(Door opens)

34:08.205 --> 34:10.196
(Door closes)

34:13.216 --> 34:15.271
Take it easy, they're pretty nippy.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.962
Ah, Lyle, my boy.
Have you got something for me?

34:23.005 --> 34:24.996
I'm afraid not, Mr Matthews.

34:25.045 --> 34:27.036
I spoke to David and Ylsa.

34:27.085 --> 34:30.793
This is an agreement between both parties,
so they are my clients, too,

34:30.844 --> 34:32.563
and they don't want this.

34:32.866 --> 34:35.277
I thought we understood each other.

34:35.527 --> 34:38.659
I really want that car, Mr Matthews,

34:39.338 --> 34:41.443
but I've got to do what is in
the best interests of my client

34:41.453 --> 34:43.917
and I don't think this loan is in
their best interests.

34:43.927 --> 34:47.197
I'm sorry.
David doesn't want to sign any agreement.

34:47.531 --> 34:49.117
I think the best way for us all to proceed

34:49.127 --> 34:51.799
would be for you to sit down with your son
and have a chat.

34:52.091 --> 34:54.436
An open and honest chat.

34:55.212 --> 34:57.596
Open and honest?

34:57.645 --> 35:00.239
You do remember what I do for a living,
don't you?

35:12.271 --> 35:13.200
Janet.

35:16.381 --> 35:17.310
Are you all right?

35:20.351 --> 35:22.516
- What's the matter?
- She did it.

35:24.435 --> 35:26.516
She did it but she didn't realise.

35:27.821 --> 35:29.647
It's all in the data,

35:29.793 --> 35:32.519
only it wasn't put together properly

35:32.529 --> 35:34.929
and I've been through it and it works.

35:34.939 --> 35:37.680
It works, the model works!

35:38.133 --> 35:40.964
Well, that's... She'll be famous.

35:42.094 --> 35:43.764
If only she'd known.

35:46.184 --> 35:48.516
If only she'd waited.

35:48.974 --> 35:49.788
Ohhh.

36:02.517 --> 36:05.763
Ah, Peter, I've spoken to my wife.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.796
How did she take it?

36:08.550 --> 36:10.676
It's a little early to say.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.918
I do have some news which might...

36:13.928 --> 36:16.282
Peter, can you hang on just one moment.

36:16.325 --> 36:18.241
There's something I must do. It won't take long,

36:18.251 --> 36:21.153
but I really think I ought to get it over with.

36:40.269 --> 36:44.274
Thank you all for indulging me
at such short notice.

36:45.506 --> 36:50.348
During my interview
I was asked if there was anything I have done

36:50.358 --> 36:53.995
which might bring the college's reputation
into question.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.241
At the time I said no.

36:59.122 --> 37:01.924
That wasn't entirely the truth.

37:04.685 --> 37:07.346
Some years ago, I conducted an affair

37:07.356 --> 37:10.358
with another academic at this college.

37:12.584 --> 37:16.441
I'm therefore withdrawing
my candidacy as Master.

37:22.765 --> 37:23.993
Withdrew your nomination?

37:24.261 --> 37:27.003
Geoffrey, that's very noble of you.

37:27.045 --> 37:30.698
They refused to accept.
Said my personal life had nothing to do

37:30.708 --> 37:33.125
with my qualification to serve the college.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.883
Well, that's true.

37:35.415 --> 37:36.991
- Perhaps.
(Clock strikes)

37:37.001 --> 37:39.554
Five o'clock,
we have to get you to your podium.

37:39.605 --> 37:42.597
Tell me this news of yours as we walk.

37:58.525 --> 38:00.516
Good afternoon, Mrs Barkway.

38:41.611 --> 38:46.841
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know many of you knew Dr Mary Goodyear.

38:47.995 --> 38:54.633
When Mary died, her work in the Pacific Ocean
was on the brink of a tremendous breakthrough,

38:54.997 --> 38:57.836
and I'm delighted
to be able today to announce

38:57.885 --> 39:01.560
that the college will be funding
the completion of her research.

39:02.210 --> 39:06.358
It will be supervised by Mary's life partner
Janet Cramer,

39:06.649 --> 39:08.396
who with great generosity

39:08.445 --> 39:13.099
has donated the entirety of Mary's notes
and papers to the college.

39:14.270 --> 39:18.089
Miss Cramer, you have our most sincere thanks.

39:19.085 --> 39:21.076
(Mouths)

39:32.325 --> 39:36.034
(Sighs) Peter will be back soon.
How are we doing?

39:36.649 --> 39:38.883
- Have they all gone?
- Yep, that's the lot.

39:39.859 --> 39:40.756
Thank God!

39:40.766 --> 39:43.720
So, did you see how much we made
from my tech support?

39:43.730 --> 39:44.722
Mm-hm.

39:46.045 --> 39:48.081
- Here.
- What's this?

39:48.125 --> 39:50.434
- Your 10%.
- 10%?

39:50.884 --> 39:54.933
We were partners. Equal partners.
Anderson & Millington, that's 50%.

39:54.943 --> 39:58.000
You're lucky to get 10.
The rest goes to Kingdom & Kingdom

39:58.010 --> 40:00.356
and just about covers sorting this mess out.

40:00.366 --> 40:01.566
(Knocking)

40:03.056 --> 40:05.284
Mr Anderson, I know it's late

40:05.325 --> 40:07.634
but I was hoping you'd do something for us.

40:11.085 --> 40:13.076
(David sings)

40:15.325 --> 40:17.316
Someone saw a local boy

40:17.365 --> 40:20.038
Crawl along the shore

40:20.925 --> 40:23.803
Oh, hello, Ylsa, love.

40:23.845 --> 40:25.836
Hello, Mrs Compton.

40:27.125 --> 40:30.117
Oh, and you've brought that nice Mr Anderson.

40:30.165 --> 40:32.281
He's looking after my cats for me.

40:32.325 --> 40:35.442
I can't take them with me,
not where I'm going, you know.

40:35.485 --> 40:38.636
Mrs Compton, where are you going?

40:38.907 --> 40:41.652
Norwich. My son's there.

40:41.662 --> 40:43.961
I'm going to live with him.

40:44.277 --> 40:46.803
He's allergic, you see.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.201
- Mrs Compton's selling us her house.
- And for hardly nothing.

40:50.245 --> 40:52.156
Well, they need a place, see.

40:52.323 --> 40:53.628
You know each other, then?

40:53.638 --> 40:57.396
Ylsa? She's my beautician.
She does my hair and that.

40:57.887 --> 40:59.436
You won't be needing that loan, then?

40:59.485 --> 41:03.558
No, she's done us proud.
Needs fixing up, but we can do that.

41:04.465 --> 41:06.995
We wanted to ask you
if you could sort out the paperwork for us.

41:07.045 --> 41:10.640
As soon as you can.
I want to make babies right now.

41:10.685 --> 41:14.041
Ooh, right. Erm...
I'll see what I can do.

41:14.814 --> 41:17.564
You, I want a word with you.

41:22.485 --> 41:24.635
He could have had a proper job.

41:24.685 --> 41:26.641
Made something of himself.

41:26.685 --> 41:29.836
I know. But what he would have made
of himself is...

41:31.085 --> 41:32.564
...is someone else.

41:32.849 --> 41:33.850
Maybe.

41:34.955 --> 41:37.205
Still, they're all right.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.762
And you, you are an honest lawyer.

41:42.413 --> 41:45.244
And that's as rare as hens' teeth.

41:45.625 --> 41:47.594
Not that you'll ever be rich, mind.

41:48.837 --> 41:50.955
But business is business.

41:51.059 --> 41:53.156
- Sign.
- What?

41:53.205 --> 41:54.117
There!

42:05.125 --> 42:07.116
(Engine starts)

42:12.645 --> 42:14.004
Fantastic!

42:14.014 --> 42:16.832
Oh, look at you! There you are, my beauty!

42:16.842 --> 42:19.161
Yes, you're mine! I'm coming for you!

42:19.205 --> 42:22.720
Yes! Here I am!

42:22.765 --> 42:25.074
Oh, look at that! Beautiful!

42:25.125 --> 42:27.116
Ohhhh!

42:35.711 --> 42:36.588
Um...

42:37.925 --> 42:40.162
Er... Lyle...

42:42.231 --> 42:44.396
What on earth is that?

42:44.445 --> 42:46.515
That Peter, is the look of the future.

42:46.565 --> 42:49.363
Oh, so the future's kind of melted-looking

42:49.405 --> 42:51.521
and about the size of a handbag, is it?

42:51.565 --> 42:54.175
- Quiet week?
- Oh, yes, yeah, very quiet.

43:01.435 --> 43:05.274
Ah. So, how's Scott been?

43:05.284 --> 43:07.714
- Not too boisterous?
- Sssh! Don't wake him.

43:08.527 --> 43:09.842
And the office?

43:10.102 --> 43:13.241
Er... All taken care of.

43:13.821 --> 43:15.996
Good. Very good.

43:16.045 --> 43:18.036
Well done, Lyle.

43:19.845 --> 43:21.836
(Meowing)
- (Laughs nervously)

43:21.885 --> 43:23.054
Er, yes.

43:23.064 --> 43:25.885
Erm... About that... I'll...

43:25.925 --> 43:27.916
Just one second.

43:32.598 --> 43:34.076
What exactly happened just then?

43:37.925 --> 43:39.995
Peter, there's something I should tell you.

43:40.485 --> 43:42.476
Do you fancy an evening stroll?

43:43.911 --> 43:47.601
Er... This... This is a bit weird.

43:49.245 --> 43:51.554
It's just that I've never really been very good

43:51.564 --> 43:54.399
at the whole brother thing. Erm...

43:54.445 --> 43:57.278
You were there for that, weren't you?

43:57.895 --> 44:00.319
You were always solid

44:00.365 --> 44:03.914
and I think that
that's why she maybe wants...

44:03.924 --> 44:07.241
Sorry, are you planning on making sense
at any stage?

44:09.266 --> 44:12.158
I just don't understand why she didn't pick you.

44:12.205 --> 44:14.771
- Why who didn't pick me for what?
(Pager beeps)

44:15.405 --> 44:19.364
Erm... I think your trousers
are trying to tell you something.

44:20.565 --> 44:23.841
Oh. Oh, my God! It can't be now.

44:24.163 --> 44:25.259
<i>What can't be now?</i>

44:25.269 --> 44:27.450
The baby! It's too soon.

44:27.460 --> 44:30.318
- Beatrice's baby?
- Yes, it's three weeks early.

44:33.245 --> 44:35.236
Oh! Peter.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.717
- Can I borrow the Alvis?

44:39.765 --> 44:41.756
No, no, she wants me to go.

44:42.724 --> 44:44.118
Just me.

44:45.045 --> 44:47.115
Oh. Erm...

44:47.426 --> 44:48.314
