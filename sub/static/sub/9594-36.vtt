WEBVTT

00:27.295 --> 00:28.762
Great work out there, Titans.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.265
And because you were able
to save Jump City

00:31.299 --> 00:32.666
without singing a song,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.403
doing a silly dance,
or making me look like a fool,

00:35.436 --> 00:38.772
I've decided
to reward you all with...

00:40.441 --> 00:42.310
Dramatic pause.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.278
Just say it!

00:44.312 --> 00:45.646
A...

00:46.514 --> 00:48.182
Get ready for it.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.385
Pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi,
pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi, pi...

00:51.419 --> 00:54.188
Starting to lose
interest, bro.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.257
...iii...

00:56.290 --> 00:57.825
Do we need to call
a doctor, Robin?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.128
He looks
like he's in the pain.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.130
...zza!

01:04.632 --> 01:05.866
I thought
you'd be more excited.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.169
We have no idea
what you just said.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.471
Oh. I'm ordering you a pizza!

01:10.804 --> 01:12.072
Pizza.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.075
That's right, pizza!

01:16.144 --> 01:17.578
-Pizza!

01:17.611 --> 01:19.180
-Pizza!

01:19.213 --> 01:20.814
Whoo!

01:20.848 --> 01:22.616
Pizza, pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza, pizza!

01:24.352 --> 01:25.786
That's more like it.

01:25.819 --> 01:26.887
So, the toppings...

01:26.920 --> 01:28.622
Hawaiian, Hawa... Hawaiian.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.124
Veggies!

01:30.158 --> 01:31.892
Groundnuts with mints!

01:31.925 --> 01:33.827
Black olives! Yeah!

01:34.462 --> 01:36.797
Pepperoni!

01:36.830 --> 01:38.599
Quiet!

01:38.632 --> 01:39.867
What I was trying to say is

01:39.900 --> 01:41.735
I didn't have the money
for toppings.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.505
-So it will be plain cheese.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.584
Ah! Unh-unh-unh!

01:56.617 --> 01:59.553
Now, before we dig in,
I want everyone's assurance

01:59.587 --> 02:02.356
that we will enjoy
this pizza responsibly.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.425
What are you even
talking about, bruh?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.360
For some reason
every time we eat pizza,

02:06.394 --> 02:09.497
we end up fighting over it
and running around silly
and everything!

02:09.530 --> 02:11.899
That does not sound like us!

02:11.932 --> 02:12.800
Well, a little.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.369
Pizza makes you all do
both goofy humor

02:15.403 --> 02:16.604
and goofy random humor.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.240
I don't want any of that.
Understood?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.175
You are the overacting, Robin.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.876
It is only the pizza.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.150
Yeehaw!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.520
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

02:43.297 --> 02:44.798
Oh. No, no, no!
You're doing it!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.468
You're running around
silly and everything!

02:48.702 --> 02:50.938
Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:50.971 --> 02:53.607
Look at what
you've become, Titans.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.676
Running around silly
and everything!

02:55.709 --> 02:58.312
You have to stop this.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.714
Because I haven't gotten
a slice yet!

03:02.750 --> 03:04.418
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

03:04.452 --> 03:05.619
Awooga!

03:10.458 --> 03:11.792
Pizza, pizza, pizza,
pizza, pizza!

03:18.466 --> 03:19.867
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

03:23.571 --> 03:25.639
I'm a wizard.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.459
Man, that was some good pizza!

03:45.493 --> 03:46.660
Maybe too good.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.896
Is it too early
for the breakfast pizza?

03:48.929 --> 03:52.333
It's too early
and it's too late.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.601
What does that even mean?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.536
I don't like
what pizza is doing to us.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.338
When I first tried
to form the Titans,

03:57.371 --> 03:59.707
we were going to stand
for truth and justice!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.342
Who cares
about truth and justice?

04:01.375 --> 04:02.610
Exactly, no one!

04:02.643 --> 04:04.478
I couldn't find anyone
to join me!

04:04.512 --> 04:06.280
So in a moment
of desperation,

04:06.314 --> 04:09.783
I turned to a popular
superhero team for help.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.653
I just don't understand
why no one wants
to join my team?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.955
I'm promising truth
and justice.

04:14.988 --> 04:15.956
What more is there?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.825
SUPERHERO: I know
what you're missing, dude.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.661
Booyakasha!

04:20.694 --> 04:22.029
He said "Booyakasha"?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.764
That sounds
like my catch phrase.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.000
No, Cy, yours is "Booyah."

04:27.034 --> 04:28.602
...kasha.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.673
That is not the point
of the story!

04:32.706 --> 04:35.609
The point is
pizza brought us together,

04:35.643 --> 04:36.910
made us popular.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.046
I just don't like
what it's turned us into.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.949
But, Robin,
pizza is of great importance.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.718
Yeah, and pizza is
the coolest food.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.420
Look how cool it makes me!

04:50.758 --> 04:52.926
We can't give up pizza.
It's our thing.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.063
It's just bread and cheese
in the shape of a circle.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.899
I have no choice
but to institute...

04:58.932 --> 05:00.634
A pizza ban.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.640
Pizza van! Yeah!

05:06.674 --> 05:09.677
Driving in the van,
eating pizza is so good.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.413
No, Beast Boy.
He said "pizza ban."

05:12.446 --> 05:14.081
Oh! Like pizza guitars,

05:14.114 --> 05:17.117
pizza drums,
even cooler!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.386
No.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.087
Ban!

05:20.120 --> 05:21.755
Oh!

05:21.789 --> 05:24.658
Uh, I don't know
what that means, actually.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.560
It means no more pizza
from now on!

05:26.594 --> 05:29.329
ALL: No!

05:31.799 --> 05:33.667
Good pizza-free
morning, Titans.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.803
What is going on?

05:35.836 --> 05:39.440
Do not worry, Robin,
it is just the mask, you see.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.410
Look, we don't mind
truth and justice, Robin,

05:42.443 --> 05:44.878
but we all joined this team
for the pizza.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.647
And if we can't eat pizza here

05:46.680 --> 05:49.850
then we'll eat with those cool
skateboarding turtle dudes.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.453
But you're not turtles,
or mutated!

05:52.486 --> 05:54.755
Already thought
about that, bro.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.390
Toxic Ooze!

06:14.642 --> 06:16.076
Sweet!

06:16.109 --> 06:18.879
Awesome!

06:18.912 --> 06:20.481
Cool.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.153
Now, if you will
excuse us, Robin,

06:26.186 --> 06:29.923
we have the new friends
to eat the pizza with.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.836
I was hoping this team
was held together

06:42.870 --> 06:45.038
by a bond stronger than pizza.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.575
Cheese is
the strongest bond, bro.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.042
I see that now.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.545
If the Titans are going
to continue to stay together,

06:51.579 --> 06:53.514
I must lift the pizza ban.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.650
Whoa! You can lift
the pizza van?
They're so heavy!

06:56.684 --> 06:59.186
No, we can eat pizza again.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.491
Let's make it official.
What toppings do you want?

07:03.524 --> 07:04.658
-Mushroom.
-Pineapple.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.697
Plain cheese it is!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.900
Hi, I'd like to make
an order for a delivery.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.134
Uh, what do you mean?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.736
Oh, I see.

07:16.837 --> 07:17.905
They're out of pizza.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.673
So? Call somewhere else.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.775
You don't get it.
Everyone's out of pizza!

07:21.809 --> 07:22.876
Everyone in the world!

07:22.910 --> 07:25.078
How can that be?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.781
There's only
one possible explanation.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.483
Turtle dudes.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.024
Gah, this is so gross!

07:37.057 --> 07:39.827
Well, this is where the cool
pizza-eating mutants live.

07:39.860 --> 07:44.231
How can you eat pizza
when you're surrounded
by all that is filth?

07:45.733 --> 07:47.701
The filth.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.503
Let's get this over with.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.242
TURTLE:
What's the password, dude?

07:55.275 --> 07:56.710
Just let us in.

07:56.744 --> 07:57.911
Password.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.681
Totally tubular.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.715
Come on in!

08:18.265 --> 08:20.167
What up, Titan bros?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.636
So, this is
what happened

08:22.670 --> 08:24.605
to the world's pizza supply.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.939
But why?

08:25.973 --> 08:27.274
When we told Robin
about the power of pizza,

08:27.307 --> 08:28.876
we were just
trying to be cool,

08:28.909 --> 08:30.744
youngish, mutated,
karate turtle dudes.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.280
But then you guys blew up.
You wouldn't stop
ordering pizza

08:33.313 --> 08:34.948
and there wasn't any
left for us.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.650
You know what
we had to eat instead?

08:36.684 --> 08:37.751
Filth?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.219
No! Gross!

08:39.252 --> 08:42.322
We had to eat sandwiches,
and sandwiches are not cool.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.593
Hey, whoa!
Sandwiches are super cool.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.629
Bottom line, broseph,
you took pizza from us,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.330
and now, we're taking it back.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.766
Sorry.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.168
Then that leaves us
one option.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.236
Titans, go!

09:17.324 --> 09:20.060
Guess there's only room
for one, goofy, pizza-eating,

09:20.093 --> 09:22.329
random-humor,
superhero team, huh?

09:22.362 --> 09:26.800
We may be goofy
with goofy random humor,

09:26.834 --> 09:29.269
but you're forgetting
one thing.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.105
We run around silly
and everything!

09:42.349 --> 09:44.985
Pow, pow, pow!
Pow, pow, pow!

09:51.224 --> 09:54.261
Dude, their humor
is too goofy and random.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.165
They won't stop running around
silly and everything.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.306
I was wrong, guys.

10:06.339 --> 10:10.243
I now know truth and justice
mean nothing without pizza!

10:10.277 --> 10:13.013
What shall we do
with the cool turtle dudes?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.215
I've got a radical idea.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.289
ALL: Cowabunga!
