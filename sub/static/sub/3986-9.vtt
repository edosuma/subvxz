00:39.267 --> 00:40.934
2316.

00:41.034 --> 00:42.100
Yeah, lester.

00:42.201 --> 00:44.367
- Where are you at?
- On monk in east baltimore.

00:44.466 --> 00:46.001
- Who's on Marlo?
- No one right now.

00:46.136 --> 00:47.268
- Marlo's been the
hardest to follow.

00:47.368 --> 00:50.037
Too paranoid.
Too much counter-surveillance.

00:50.204 --> 00:52.170
Well, peel off monk

00:52.337 --> 00:54.571
and head out broening highway

00:54.671 --> 00:56.538
to the marine terminals.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.038
Map forty-four,

00:58.172 --> 01:01.271
grid g-as-in-george-ten.

01:01.371 --> 01:03.171
- Forty-four.
- Affirmative.

01:03.271 --> 01:04.771
This is a fresh one.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.105
- If they're going all
the way out there,

01:06.207 --> 01:07.607
then it might just be...
- Damn right.

01:07.739 --> 01:09.608
On it.

01:09.740 --> 01:12.174
Twenty-three-oh-six to
all units on this detail.

01:12.274 --> 01:13.341
New twenty is map forty-four,

01:13.441 --> 01:14.974
grid g-george-ten.

01:15.107 --> 01:16.774
That's forty-four g-george-ten.

01:16.874 --> 01:18.906
Flood that grid and look
for suspect vehicles.

01:19.007 --> 01:21.475
- Twenty-three-twelve.
Ten-four.

01:21.609 --> 01:22.743
Take me a while.

01:22.843 --> 01:24.411
I'm up northeast. You want
me to stay on cheese?

01:24.511 --> 01:26.344
- Negative. New twenty
is a priority.

01:26.444 --> 01:27.643
Think we're on the main stem.

01:58.750 --> 02:01.585
- Yeah?
- Mcnulty? It's on.

02:01.684 --> 02:03.849
- Yeah?
- Oh, hell yeah.

02:03.951 --> 02:04.983
Alright...

02:13.652 --> 02:15.919
[telephone

04:02.943 --> 04:05.943
"Deserve got nuthin' to do with it."
- Snoop.

04:24.146 --> 04:25.780
okay, whatchya got?

04:25.879 --> 04:28.146
- Well, we rolled around until
bobby spotted chris partlow

04:28.247 --> 04:30.180
pulled up on a lot two
blocks from here.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.281
So we sat on him until
Marlo posted.

04:32.382 --> 04:34.317
They talked for a minute,
then Marlo bounced.

04:34.416 --> 04:35.949
And chris goes to the
warehouse gate alone

04:36.084 --> 04:37.782
and a cola white boys
open up.

04:37.883 --> 04:38.983
He's inside now?

04:39.116 --> 04:40.949
- Entrance is around front
from what I can tell,

04:41.049 --> 04:43.016
it's the only working gate.
Everything else is rusted up.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.516
- Who's watching the front?
- Two units.

04:44.616 --> 04:46.252
They're out on foot,
a block away,

04:46.385 --> 04:47.850
with a clear view of what
comes in or out.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.554
- So what do we do
if chris rolls out?

04:49.653 --> 04:51.519
- Let him go.
Partlow is muscle.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.986
He's here to make sure
it looks right.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.785
And if it does, monk or
someone else'll come on down.

04:55.885 --> 04:56.784
Cheese, too, maybe.

04:56.919 --> 04:57.820
So this is a re-up.

04:57.954 --> 05:00.053
Fuck a re-up, son.

05:00.154 --> 05:01.954
This, here, in the
middle of nowhere...

05:02.053 --> 05:04.687
Miles from anywhere
these mopes meet...

05:04.786 --> 05:06.556
This is re-supply.

05:06.688 --> 05:08.756
Other than chris, anybody
else that goes in there...

05:08.856 --> 05:11.990
If it's a Stanfield lieutenant
he's coming out dirty.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.889
You follow them back to town.
If he doesn't know you're

05:13.990 --> 05:15.789
on 'em, see where
he takes you.

05:15.889 --> 05:17.989
If he catches a scent, fuck it.

05:18.123 --> 05:20.558
Pull 'em over, jack
'em up and get the dope.

05:20.659 --> 05:22.926
And leander, you want to
snatch the man's cell

05:23.026 --> 05:25.792
before he has a chance to erase
anything that might be on it.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.225
The case is in t phones...

05:28.326 --> 05:29.560
Though we're
gonna need a title three

05:29.659 --> 05:31.058
to take
a look at them.

05:31.158 --> 05:32.561
Where are you going?

05:34.161 --> 05:35.827
Time to 'fess up.

05:38.694 --> 05:40.995
We straight?

05:41.096 --> 05:42.462
I said we straight, right?

05:43.632 --> 05:44.896
Them guns was mine.

05:44.997 --> 05:46.763
- Which guns specifically,
mr. Hill?

05:46.896 --> 05:49.397
- Whatever guns them cops took
out the truck last year.

05:49.497 --> 05:50.563
They mine.

05:50.664 --> 05:52.631
Even though I ain't
touched that iron.

05:53.829 --> 05:55.198
Ain't you got
to do the bit.

05:55.298 --> 05:57.433
- With your limited priors, mr.
Hill, you're exposed to two,

05:57.534 --> 05:59.667
maybe three years, tops.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.734
You'll be well compensated
for the time, I'm sure.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.500
No good to us no how.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.634
You on three legs.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.669
- Familiarize yourself
with the make and model

06:06.768 --> 06:08.735
of the weapons you
left in the truck, Mr. Hill.

06:08.834 --> 06:09.767
The details matter.

06:09.867 --> 06:11.668
- I get shot up
an' then this shit.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.001
Y'all ask a lot, dontcha?

06:13.101 --> 06:15.002
- You can't hack, go down
walmart or someshit.

06:15.103 --> 06:17.571
And see if they take care you
while you laid up for a while.

06:17.705 --> 06:19.037
C'mon, nigga.

06:27.103 --> 06:29.772
- Jeez. In the department,
you take one in the line

06:29.871 --> 06:31.941
they give you light duty
for as long as you need,

06:32.040 --> 06:34.007
then you get to name
your next assignment.

06:34.107 --> 06:35.574
Marlo runs a tighter ship.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.144
Open it.

07:11.114 --> 07:14.179
Six icebox, twenty each.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.582
You count, we wait.

07:15.682 --> 07:16.615
You no count,

07:16.715 --> 07:18.716
we go to lunch early.

07:58.190 --> 08:00.493
- Twenty-three fourteen
to twenty-three-oh-six.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.725
Suspect number three is in.

08:02.858 --> 08:03.791
You sure it was him?

08:03.891 --> 08:05.725
- Been following the
damn truck for a week.

08:05.824 --> 08:06.725
Shouldnow by now.

08:06.824 --> 08:07.725
Copy that.

08:07.858 --> 08:15.528
- Truck. Ticks
have six legs or eight?

08:15.628 --> 08:17.395
- Must have
been a readjustment.

08:17.495 --> 08:21.228
- London was a sweet posting.
I can't lie.

08:21.395 --> 08:24.396
My only regret is I didn't
get the full three-year tour.

08:24.496 --> 08:25.429
Thanks.

08:25.529 --> 08:27.229
- It's no reflection
on you, man.

08:27.329 --> 08:30.129
- Shit, gus, they even sold
the building in kensington.

08:30.229 --> 08:32.929
I mean we bought that sucker
for nothing fifty years ago,

08:33.030 --> 08:36.532
and now chicago sells it off
for a couple million pounds.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.998
- Capitalization they
call it.

08:39.065 --> 08:40.499
- These newspaper-chain
guys

08:40.631 --> 08:43.032
just don't give a fuck,
do they?

08:43.164 --> 08:45.365
- Any idea where they're
gonna drop you now that

08:45.499 --> 08:46.434
you're back in charm city?

08:46.534 --> 08:48.566
No, I got no idea yet.

08:48.668 --> 08:50.302
Klebanow wants to
have lunch, so I guess it'll

08:50.435 --> 08:52.201
come at me, soon enough.

08:52.302 --> 08:54.302
Up for something now?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.702
Depends.

08:57.803 --> 09:00.236
- I gotta problem.
I need someone...

09:00.337 --> 09:03.069
A veteran reporter, quiet,
subtle, discreet.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.202
Good with details,

09:04.335 --> 09:05.670
careful to cover his tracks...

09:05.769 --> 09:07.405
- I don't care
how far we go back, gus,

09:07.537 --> 09:11.740
no way I'm gonna
kill your wife for you.

09:11.838 --> 09:14.139
- You know scott templeton?
City g.a.

09:14.339 --> 09:16.405
- The guy talking to the
homeless killer?

09:16.539 --> 09:17.505
Not really.

09:17.606 --> 09:19.506
He got hired
after I went to london.

09:19.605 --> 09:21.174
- It's better
you don't know him.

09:21.274 --> 09:24.008
No opinions,
one way or the other.

09:24.109 --> 09:25.975
No, no,
i'm not saying anything.

09:26.142 --> 09:28.342
I'm not. I just need
fresh eyes on the fella.

09:28.441 --> 09:30.442
Just a careful look.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.476
- One of whiting's pets,
isn't he?

09:33.576 --> 09:34.976
I said discreet, huh?

09:36.376 --> 09:38.276
I hope you're wrong.

09:38.342 --> 09:39.409
'course you do.

09:43.846 --> 09:44.980
It sticks. Dag.

09:45.079 --> 09:46.746
- Course it sticks.
It's barb wire.

09:46.845 --> 09:49.879
Sticking's what
it's s'posed to do.

09:50.079 --> 09:50.979
Come on.

09:51.079 --> 09:52.313
I ain't got all day.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.180
Hurry up now.

09:57.280 --> 10:07.367
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.

10:07.401 --> 10:17.451
Grab the aluminum
strips there first off.

10:17.552 --> 10:18.953
- How am I supposed
to get back over?

10:19.153 --> 10:20.320
Climb the damn fence.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.553
Do a better job of
it second time, I expect.

10:23.653 --> 10:24.919
Grab them steel pipes quick,

10:25.053 --> 10:26.320
before we get spotted.

10:39.523 --> 10:41.856
Robert ruby.

10:41.956 --> 10:43.824
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

10:43.923 --> 10:45.724
I need you to give me
a global printout

10:45.823 --> 10:48.190
on everything under scott
templeton's byline.

10:48.324 --> 10:49.825
All of it, every edition.

10:50.825 --> 10:52.227
Hey, I'm a fan.

11:13.496 --> 11:15.265
Twenty-three-fourteen.

11:15.365 --> 11:16.699
Monk is westbound
onto o'donnell.

11:16.830 --> 11:19.664
Cheese wagstaff
is on the way in.

11:19.798 --> 11:20.897
Also, there's
a truck leaving.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.496
The one we saw
back on the loading dock.

11:22.597 --> 11:23.832
That'd be empty.

11:23.931 --> 11:26.131
They've offloaded,
it's all in the warehouse now.

11:26.232 --> 11:27.500
Bobby and me
will stay on monk.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.802
Karen'll follow cheese out,

11:28.900 --> 11:30.801
you guys stay
on the gate.

11:36.366 --> 11:37.367
Forgetting for a moment

11:37.499 --> 11:39.402
our little problem
of the serial killer,

11:39.501 --> 11:41.036
we came in promising
a double-digit drop

11:41.136 --> 11:42.437
in violent crime.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.170
Right up on the
gubernatorial primary,

11:44.270 --> 11:46.235
and we're looking
at another record high.

11:46.370 --> 11:48.203
- Michael, this department
has been crippled

11:48.303 --> 11:49.538
by the budget cuts.

11:49.672 --> 11:50.638
For a year now,

11:50.739 --> 11:52.539
we haven't had
the manpower or the tools.

11:52.638 --> 11:53.571
You have them now.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.538
- Now. But this
thing is a ship,

11:55.638 --> 11:56.537
a super-tanker.

11:56.638 --> 11:57.538
We can't just
turn it around...

11:57.637 --> 11:58.773
Like that.

11:58.872 --> 12:00.273
More foot patrols.

12:00.373 --> 12:01.342
More cars on the street.

12:01.442 --> 12:03.074
Get a handle on it, dammit.

12:03.175 --> 12:04.107
See that's

12:04.207 --> 12:05.240
what doesn't work.

12:05.374 --> 12:07.341
More cops where
people can see them.

12:07.441 --> 12:08.474
More cops on the pavement,

12:08.573 --> 12:10.240
more cops riding past,

12:10.340 --> 12:11.641
more cops showing the flag

12:11.740 --> 12:14.075
so that you guys can say
you're being tough on crime.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.811
Respectfully, sir,
what works

12:15.944 --> 12:18.842
is committing to building
a real deterrent.

12:18.976 --> 12:20.609
We take the time to retool,

12:20.711 --> 12:22.510
to teach our people
not to chase stats,

12:22.644 --> 12:23.644
but to do actual
police work.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.778
- Who pulled your string,
deputy?

12:25.878 --> 12:27.611
I was told by our mayor

12:27.745 --> 12:30.111
at the outset that there
would be no more band-aids,

12:30.211 --> 12:31.577
no more stat games...

12:31.678 --> 12:33.246
- And then we got hit
with the school budget.

12:33.379 --> 12:35.247
And we lost some of the time
we needed to address

12:35.349 --> 12:37.281
the systemic things
you're talking about.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.047
Understood. We will
work back on those,

12:39.147 --> 12:40.448
and we will

12:40.548 --> 12:43.114
support that kinof reform,
if not from city hall

12:43.214 --> 12:44.780
then from annapolis,
if need be.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.448
But now, deputy, right now,

12:46.580 --> 12:49.148
my boss needs the crime
to go down.

12:49.249 --> 12:51.784
Not three years from now.
Not even a year from now.

12:51.883 --> 12:56.049
He needs a ten-percent drop
in the next quarter...

12:56.150 --> 12:57.317
Or no one

12:57.417 --> 13:00.151
is gonna be in a position
to reform anything.

13:08.486 --> 13:10.221
Be creative, gentlemen.

13:19.520 --> 13:20.421
Deputy.

13:20.520 --> 13:21.757
A detective's outside
for you,

13:21.856 --> 13:23.122
says it's urgent.

13:29.990 --> 13:31.490
- Sydnor and I developed
a source

13:31.590 --> 13:34.525
and ran fressurveillances
on Marlo Stanfield.

13:34.626 --> 13:35.992
And we believe we're
about to catch

13:36.125 --> 13:37.025
his people very dirty.

13:37.158 --> 13:38.025
What?

13:38.125 --> 13:39.192
- We wrapped on that
clay davis

13:39.292 --> 13:41.024
thing and instead of
shutting major crimes down,

13:41.160 --> 13:43.660
we took a couple weeks and
got back up on Marlo.

13:43.761 --> 13:46.061
With the right warrants,
he's about to fall.

13:46.161 --> 13:47.528
How the fuck...

13:47.628 --> 13:49.162
- There's no time, cedric.
In an hour or so,

13:49.261 --> 13:50.261
i'm gonna need...

13:54.160 --> 13:55.061
Yeah?

13:55.161 --> 13:56.863
- Lester...
- What's up?

13:56.963 --> 13:58.699
- We pulled up monk.
Dirty as a motherfucker.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.465
Eight keys of the raw.

14:00.598 --> 14:03.064
No, he jersey-rolled a stop and
when we tried to pull him over,

14:03.164 --> 14:04.665
he went rabbit on us.

14:04.797 --> 14:06.697
We ran him down on lafayette,
by the overpass.

14:06.798 --> 14:07.766
You got the phone, right?

14:07.866 --> 14:09.766
Yeah, man. I got it.

14:09.865 --> 14:11.100
Good work.

14:12.733 --> 14:13.898
It's down.

14:13.997 --> 14:15.767
I need teams to arrest
Marlo Stanfield,

14:15.867 --> 14:17.633
chris partlow,
and cheese wagstaff.

14:17.768 --> 14:19.636
I also need someone
from our s.a.o.

14:19.736 --> 14:21.836
To get on the horn to baltimore
county for an s-and-s

14:21.935 --> 14:23.901
warrant on a middle
river warehouse.

14:24.035 --> 14:25.135
And, oh yeah...

14:26.202 --> 14:27.867
Bunk meland

14:27.968 --> 14:29.769
has a warrant on partlow

14:29.903 --> 14:31.304
for a separate homicide.

14:31.436 --> 14:33.538
He held that back so we could
do this business here.

14:33.638 --> 14:35.805
- Anything else you've neglected
to tell me, detective Freamon?

14:35.904 --> 14:37.238
No sir.

14:37.338 --> 14:39.305
I think you're caught up.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.673
- Hello?
- Ronnie, dear.

14:45.773 --> 14:46.905
Hey...

14:47.005 --> 14:58.175
- Are you sitting down?
- Why?

15:23.179 --> 15:25.014
- He was trying to erase
shit when we tackled him.

15:45.819 --> 15:46.918
Secure this location

15:47.052 --> 15:49.284
until we have written
search-and-seizure.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.467
Shit's on t.v, yo.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.371
- With a street value
of almost sixteen

17:10.470 --> 17:11.903
million dollars in heroin,

17:12.036 --> 17:14.237
and charges against high-level
traffickers who were

17:14.337 --> 17:17.470
going to put this poison on
the streets of this city...

17:17.569 --> 17:20.837
- Do this mean I still gotta
take that charge for y'all?

17:20.970 --> 17:24.839
...and perseverance by our
police department.

17:24.939 --> 17:27.540
And while I am told that this
investigation is continuing,

17:27.640 --> 17:30.972
it is my understanding that
there is at least one murder

17:31.072 --> 17:32.939
warrant associated with this
drug organization,

17:33.039 --> 17:35.475
which is believed to have
been responsible for

17:35.574 --> 17:37.808
many of those bodies found
in vacant rowhouses

17:37.907 --> 17:39.307
more than a year ago.

17:39.408 --> 17:41.107
We did not give up on that
investigation

17:41.207 --> 17:44.042
just as we do not give up
trying every day to

17:44.142 --> 17:47.277
address ourselves to the
task of making this city safe

17:47.411 --> 17:48.377
and vibrant again.

17:48.477 --> 17:50.043
And let me just say to all
others responsible

17:50.144 --> 17:53.477
for the drug trade's assault
on the welfare of this city,

17:53.577 --> 17:56.012
a day like this is
coming for you.

17:56.145 --> 17:57.545
Oh, you are so butch.

17:57.678 --> 17:59.514
- I have seen what drugs have
done to baltimore.

17:59.648 --> 18:02.113
Drug dealers do not just
destroy individuals.

18:02.213 --> 18:03.447
They destroy families.

18:03.547 --> 18:04.946
- Don't forget about the
communities.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.716
- They destroy entire
communities.

18:07.815 --> 18:09.981
Today the mayor of baltimore,
our state's attorney,

18:10.081 --> 18:13.581
our police department, and
our communities are saying:

18:13.681 --> 18:16.417
we... Have had... Enough.
Thank you.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.217
Deputy.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.151
Alma gutierrez, "sun" papers.

18:24.251 --> 18:25.785
Care to comment?

18:25.884 --> 18:27.650
- It's a good day
for the good guys.

18:27.751 --> 18:29.584
- Could you be a bit
more substantive?

18:31.520 --> 18:34.387
Last time the "sun"
had me in its pages,

18:34.487 --> 18:35.554
you had me doing
things I didn't do.

18:35.654 --> 18:36.721
Regarding?

18:36.821 --> 18:39.220
- Something about me stabbing
someone in the back.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.654
Look it up.

18:49.287 --> 18:51.557
"a source of information

18:51.657 --> 18:54.492
"identified the transmission
of photographs

18:54.591 --> 18:55.991
via cellphone."

18:56.091 --> 18:57.458
Fuck do that mean?

18:57.558 --> 18:58.825
"source of information."

18:58.957 --> 19:00.425
They sayin' somebody talkin'?

19:00.525 --> 19:01.825
Who the fuck even know?

19:01.924 --> 19:03.157
I wanna talk to the lawyer.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.159
And you caught a murder,
too.

19:07.260 --> 19:12.428
says the same shit
on yours, huh?

19:12.628 --> 19:14.527
"from information received,

19:14.661 --> 19:17.596
investigation led to d.n.a.
Analysis of the victim."

19:17.695 --> 19:19.395
They got you on d.n.a.?

19:19.495 --> 19:20.961
My hair, I expect.

19:21.061 --> 19:24.462
- "From information received."
More of that snitchin' shit.

19:24.562 --> 19:26.530
- I'm sayin',
where the information come from?

19:26.631 --> 19:28.064
Onliest people knew 'bout
the deed is us right here.

19:28.199 --> 19:29.064
Snoop knew.

19:29.199 --> 19:30.231
Shit.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.565
- What about your
youngun michael?

19:31.698 --> 19:33.031
Maybe it was him ran his mouth.

19:34.165 --> 19:35.131
He got picked up, right?

19:35.231 --> 19:36.598
I did that thing for him.

19:36.732 --> 19:37.964
Why would he talk about it an'
put hisself in?

19:38.064 --> 19:39.500
- He been tested
on the streets.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.667
Maybe he act different
in the rooms downtown.

19:41.766 --> 19:43.568
- Boy been throwin' up all
kinda backtalk 'bout shit.

19:43.668 --> 19:44.568
Buck' wild about this 'n that.

19:44.668 --> 19:46.101
Like what?

19:46.168 --> 19:48.234
- Cryin' about how june bug
and his people got lit up.

19:48.334 --> 19:50.168
Cryin' about how omar in the
street runnin' his mouth,

19:50.300 --> 19:51.702
callin' for you to step to...

19:51.803 --> 19:52.803
Omar say what?

19:52.903 --> 19:54.002
Nuthin'.

19:56.903 --> 19:58.102
Omar tried callin'
you out by name.

19:58.202 --> 19:59.101
But, shit, it wadn't nothin'...

19:59.204 --> 20:00.271
What he say about me?

20:00.404 --> 20:01.603
- Nuthin', man.
Just talkin' shit.

20:01.704 --> 20:03.439
He use my name?

20:03.540 --> 20:04.605
In the street?

20:06.071 --> 20:08.305
Talk, motherfucker.

20:08.405 --> 20:10.572
He just, ya know...

20:10.672 --> 20:12.672
Say that you need to
step to and that...

20:15.773 --> 20:17.675
I dunno, he just runnin'
his mouth some.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.041
He call me a punk?

20:19.141 --> 20:20.108
It was bullshit, man.

20:20.208 --> 20:21.141
You ain't need
that on your mind.

20:21.241 --> 20:22.507
- What the fuck you
know about

20:22.608 --> 20:25.177
what I need on my mind,
motherfucker.

20:25.309 --> 20:26.910
My name was on the street.

20:29.075 --> 20:30.142
When we bounce from
this shit here,

20:30.276 --> 20:31.142
y'all gonna go down
to them corners,

20:31.242 --> 20:32.375
let them people know.

20:32.476 --> 20:34.877
Word did not
get back to me.

20:37.379 --> 20:38.846
Let 'em know Marlo
step to any motherfucker.

20:38.945 --> 20:42.879
Omar, barksdale...
Whoever.

20:42.978 --> 20:44.712
My name is my name.

20:54.515 --> 20:55.916
Don't see the boy snitchin'.

20:56.015 --> 20:57.581
Neither do i.

20:59.282 --> 21:01.082
But you ready to bet
your future on that?

21:09.852 --> 21:11.654
- Ya see that, mcnulty?
Ya see it?

21:11.786 --> 21:13.519
One detective,
working the file,

21:13.619 --> 21:15.085
running a few things
down and bang...

21:15.186 --> 21:16.519
He's got an arrest.

21:16.619 --> 21:18.418
Shit, now that chris partlow's
locked up

21:18.553 --> 21:20.186
we might have some
witnesses coming forward

21:20.285 --> 21:21.186
on those cases in
the vacants.

21:21.285 --> 21:22.353
Clear 'em all on paper.

21:22.487 --> 21:24.021
- We got the one
is all, boss.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.923
- One today, more tomorrow.
And from what?

21:26.022 --> 21:29.122
- From the bunk
just workin' a file.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.822
Business as usual.
But you...

21:30.923 --> 21:32.923
With your
overtime and your cars

21:33.054 --> 21:34.156
and your
surveillance detail

21:34.257 --> 21:35.557
and your bullshit,

21:35.657 --> 21:36.657
where the fuck are
you on your redball?

21:36.757 --> 21:38.089
Nowhere.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.524
Killer stopped calling.
Stopped killing, too.

21:42.625 --> 21:44.158
I admit it.
I'm nowhere.

21:44.291 --> 21:45.227
- From everything
we've given you,

21:45.327 --> 21:46.727
fire should be
shooting out your ass,

21:46.827 --> 21:50.760
but no, there you sit
like a genital wart.

21:50.860 --> 22:02.062
C'mon, mcnulty.
Show me something.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.696
- So what are you
gonna do now?

22:03.795 --> 22:06.563
Keep half a district worth
of manpower on the street,

22:06.662 --> 22:07.896
chasing bullshit?

22:08.030 --> 22:09.597
It'll wind down.

22:09.698 --> 22:11.564
No more killing,
no more disappearances,

22:11.664 --> 22:12.931
no more calls.

22:16.666 --> 22:17.833
Marlo is in cuffs.

22:17.933 --> 22:19.500
Fuck Marlo.

22:19.601 --> 22:20.834
Fuck you.

22:29.066 --> 22:30.533
- What's going on in
klebanow's office?

22:30.633 --> 22:32.001
Planning meeting.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.036
Pulitzer submissions.

22:34.136 --> 22:35.236
This early?

22:38.502 --> 22:40.302
- The important thing is
that we build on this

22:40.403 --> 22:42.168
through the end of the year,
with no falloff of coverage.

22:42.303 --> 22:43.371
Exactly.

22:43.504 --> 22:45.037
And scott,
we need to start looking

22:45.138 --> 22:46.170
for the points where the
response to the problem

22:46.271 --> 22:47.170
can be criticized.

22:47.304 --> 22:48.604
The "gotcha." I know.

22:48.704 --> 22:50.270
- At this point,
we can't tell what category

22:50.404 --> 22:51.372
we'll enter with this,

22:51.473 --> 22:53.639
but in public service
especially,

22:53.738 --> 22:54.641
greater weight is given
to stories

22:54.741 --> 22:56.174
that result in
changes to policy,

22:56.273 --> 22:57.474
or new legislation.

22:57.575 --> 23:00.540
- So covering the reactions
to our stories

23:00.640 --> 23:03.140
is as important as
the stories themselves.

23:03.273 --> 23:04.640
- Between now and new year's,
we want to a hammer

23:04.739 --> 23:06.476
at whatever changes
or discussions

23:06.641 --> 23:08.743
or actions result from your
coverage of the homeless.

23:08.844 --> 23:11.076
- And graphics matter.
Our presentation must be

23:11.210 --> 23:13.543
clean and professional when it
goes to the committee.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.910
- You guys really think this
has a shot at a pulitzer?

23:16.009 --> 23:18.177
I do and it does.

23:18.277 --> 23:21.144
Being on the pulitzer board
for a coup of terms,

23:21.244 --> 23:22.644
I've seen the process up close.

23:22.744 --> 23:24.144
There's a way of
doing these things.

23:24.243 --> 23:25.244
Time honored.

23:25.346 --> 23:28.178
Knowing how is why they
pay me the big bucks.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.647
- Alright. What do we
want to say exactly?

23:30.747 --> 23:31.848
With our coverage.

23:31.949 --> 23:34.047
What do we want to say
about homelessness?

23:34.147 --> 23:35.347
I mean, it's bad.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.313
It's very bad, granted.
Buisn't it actually

23:37.414 --> 23:39.749
symptomatic of a much
greater dynamic...

23:39.849 --> 23:41.582
- We want to rediscover
a world

23:41.682 --> 23:43.284
that for too long
has been ignored.

23:43.383 --> 23:45.116
Examine the tragedy
underlying these murders,

23:45.217 --> 23:46.283
the neglect...

23:46.383 --> 23:48.316
The dickensian aspect.

23:48.417 --> 23:49.783
Exactly.

23:55.084 --> 23:56.251
Alma, dearest.

23:58.251 --> 23:59.351
This quote from daniels:

23:59.485 --> 24:00.954
"it's a good day for
the good guys."

24:01.085 --> 24:02.353
He couldn't come up with
anything better than that?

24:02.453 --> 24:03.588
He wouldn't play.

24:03.721 --> 24:05.387
Says we took his name in vain
last time we used it.

24:05.488 --> 24:06.821
When was that?

24:06.955 --> 24:10.321
- When we had him back-stabbing
burrell at city hall, remember?

24:11.955 --> 24:13.354
Do you want me to call
daniels at home?

24:13.487 --> 24:14.356
Try him again?

24:14.456 --> 24:15.655
We're past deadline, gus.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.424
I'll cut the quote.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.757
Alright.

24:27.658 --> 24:29.124
Drink with me, jimmy.

24:35.193 --> 24:38.261
This is what you wanted, man.

24:38.361 --> 24:41.762
- Then why do I feel
like shit?

24:41.928 --> 24:44.127
Postpartum depression, son.

24:44.228 --> 24:48.160
It's the journey,
not the destination...

24:48.327 --> 24:51.332
We got Marlo Stanfield.

24:51.431 --> 24:52.564
What about the serial killer?

24:52.664 --> 24:54.698
Marlo is he.

24:56.030 --> 25:01.065
Daniels wanted me up there
at that press conference.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.565
Up there with all the rest of
those preening motherfuckers,

25:03.665 --> 25:07.198
congratulating themselves
on a job well done.

25:09.601 --> 25:12.236
Part of the problem,
all of them.

25:12.335 --> 25:16.135
Yet when the bracelets come out
and the dope is on the table...

25:16.235 --> 25:17.502
- We've still got
the surveillance teams.

25:17.635 --> 25:19.668
The districts still have guys
watching the homeless,

25:19.767 --> 25:21.768
undercovers dressed
as homeless...

25:21.868 --> 25:23.537
That shit'll end.

25:24.736 --> 25:26.471
It always does.

25:31.705 --> 25:33.371
Well...

25:35.405 --> 25:37.105
If you ain't gonna
celebrate with me,

25:37.205 --> 25:42.771
you're gonna at least
chauffeur my drunken ass home.

25:42.941 --> 25:45.140
Shardene better be awake, too.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.408
'cause I do believe
lester Freamon's

25:47.509 --> 25:49.675
in the mood for love...

25:51.342 --> 25:53.708
- Yo, I'm tellin' you,
it was kenard.

25:55.308 --> 25:56.342
To catch up with him.

25:56.475 --> 25:57.844
Bullshit.

25:57.944 --> 25:59.910
Omar got kilt by them
pimlico boys.

26:00.045 --> 26:02.979
They ran up on him with three
a.k.s an' jus' blazed away.

26:10.347 --> 26:11.679
What up, soldier?

26:11.779 --> 26:12.679
- I don't know.
You tell me.

26:12.779 --> 26:14.579
I mean, everybody locked up,
right?

26:14.679 --> 26:15.579
I mean, damn...

26:15.678 --> 26:17.045
Yeah. 'cause-a that shit,

26:17.144 --> 26:19.647
i'm 'a need you for some
serious business tomorrow, man.

26:19.748 --> 26:21.148
- Anyone I know?
- Big walter.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.516
Big-nose big walter?

26:22.616 --> 26:24.782
- Nah, skinny big walter,
the one be right there

26:24.883 --> 26:26.649
in front of the
cut-rate on calhoun

26:26.749 --> 26:27.649
and riggs all the time.

26:27.782 --> 26:28.716
He witnessin'?

26:28.815 --> 26:30.549
- Marlo say he need
to get got.

26:30.681 --> 26:31.984
So it is, what it is.

26:33.284 --> 26:35.119
You got a problem with that?

26:35.218 --> 26:36.219
We straight.

26:36.318 --> 26:37.785
No need to bring your iron.

26:37.919 --> 26:40.352
I got a clean nine for you
with shaved numbers.

26:40.452 --> 26:42.684
I'll pick you up tomorrow night.

26:42.785 --> 26:43.720
You a-ight?

26:43.820 --> 26:45.686
Yeah, yeah.

26:45.786 --> 26:46.987
A-ight.

26:58.189 --> 27:00.222
- And in the last five years,
the united states has

27:00.322 --> 27:03.356
given fifteen billion dollars
to fight h.i.v. And aids

27:03.456 --> 27:04.389
around the world.

27:04.489 --> 27:05.755
But only part of it goes
to africa,

27:05.856 --> 27:08.793
where there's a huge epidemic
of h.i.v. And aids.

27:08.959 --> 27:11.392
I mean, ten percent of the
population of the world

27:11.526 --> 27:13.859
lives in sub-saharan africa,
but seventy percent of

27:13.959 --> 27:15.558
the new aids cases are there.

27:15.692 --> 27:17.528
In ken,
one in seven people

27:17.628 --> 27:19.728
have h.i.v. And aids,
and in zimbabwe,

27:19.827 --> 27:22.293
one in four people have it,
according to the article in

27:22.393 --> 27:24.260
the "new york human rights
law review."

27:24.360 --> 27:26.261
Plus, the u.s. Surgeon
general has said that

27:26.362 --> 27:28.361
there are twenty-two million
people with h.i.v. And aids

27:28.461 --> 27:30.664
in those african countries.

27:30.764 --> 27:33.296
In the next ten years,
more people will die from aids

27:33.396 --> 27:36.162
in these countries than all the
wars in the twentieth century,

27:36.296 --> 27:38.530
including world war two,
the deadliest war...

27:38.662 --> 27:40.430
How's it feelin', bunny?

27:41.831 --> 27:42.898
- I tell ya,
if I had that boy's

27:43.030 --> 27:44.900
gift for talk,
i'd a really caused a stir.

27:45.000 --> 27:45.966
Look at him go...

27:46.065 --> 27:47.499
Don't sell yourself short.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.365
He's got your way of makin'
an argument.

27:50.499 --> 27:53.801
Lucky for him, though,
he looks like his stepmama.

27:53.901 --> 27:55.367
- And aids in africa
said u.s. Money

27:55.467 --> 27:59.200
can make a huge difference
in africa where even very small

27:59.300 --> 28:01.002
amounts can go a long way.

28:01.135 --> 28:03.101
There seems to be an agreement
that the money should be spent

28:03.237 --> 28:06.570
in two ways: medical treatment
and for education and

28:06.703 --> 28:07.937
prevention.

28:08.036 --> 28:09.670
However, there is not an
agreement on how much money

28:09.769 --> 28:11.969
will be needed and what
programs...

28:12.069 --> 28:13.702
When do we bounce?

28:13.802 --> 28:16.038
I'm working on bail reviews.

28:16.137 --> 28:17.706
Cheese maybe...

28:17.841 --> 28:20.007
On a high surety bond,
if he wants to put up

28:20.139 --> 28:21.506
his mama's house.
Monk, the same.

28:21.573 --> 28:24.840
But with the murder warrant,
there is no bail for chris,

28:24.940 --> 28:28.240
and most likely,
there's no bail for you,

28:28.374 --> 28:30.407
as the charging papers portray
you at the top

28:30.507 --> 28:32.674
of the conspiracy.

28:32.774 --> 28:34.374
- How can they say that when I
ain't go near no drugs at all?

28:34.474 --> 28:35.876
- The full affidavit says
they developed

28:35.975 --> 28:37.174
a source of information...

28:37.276 --> 28:38.411
Bullshit.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.110
- A source of information
who told them that

28:40.243 --> 28:42.110
you communicated with
each other

28:42.243 --> 28:46.011
using photographic transmissions
on cellphones.

28:46.143 --> 28:47.409
Coded transmissions.

28:47.544 --> 28:49.177
- Ain't nobody know
about the code 'cept me,

28:49.279 --> 28:53.113
chris, monk an' cheese...

28:53.213 --> 28:54.847
An' we all locked
up behind this.

28:54.947 --> 28:57.213
No one else even have a phone.
Not even snoop.

28:57.313 --> 28:58.780
No one 'cept the supply.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.280
You trust the supplier?

29:01.348 --> 29:03.015
Well, someone knew
and someone told.

29:03.114 --> 29:04.514
And now they've got
your cellphones,

29:04.614 --> 29:06.015
and they're going for
a title three.

29:06.147 --> 29:07.214
- So they was on our
cell phones then...

29:07.314 --> 29:09.348
- No, the affidavit says
the source told them

29:09.449 --> 29:11.515
the date of your re-supply,
that they followed monk

29:11.616 --> 29:14.117
and others to the warehouse,
followed him out,

29:14.218 --> 29:15.751
and found the drugs.

29:15.851 --> 29:17.350
They're going to get
their title three

29:17.450 --> 29:19.450
and they're saying that by
examining monk's phone,

29:19.583 --> 29:21.017
your phone, and the others,

29:21.117 --> 29:22.183
they're going to prove
the conspiracy.

29:22.284 --> 29:23.618
You see?

29:23.719 --> 29:25.451
They weren't on a wiretap,
but now they're using

29:25.585 --> 29:27.820
the phones and photographs
to link you all together.

29:27.921 --> 29:30.453
So who knew that there
was a re-supply?

29:30.587 --> 29:33.020
Who knew what you all were
up to yesterday?

29:33.119 --> 29:34.085
Snoop.

29:34.185 --> 29:35.621
D you trust her.

29:36.822 --> 29:37.923
Who else?

29:40.187 --> 29:42.688
- Known sex offenders,
southern district.

29:42.788 --> 29:43.689
Three possibles.

29:43.823 --> 29:44.690
- You want us to sit
on them?

29:44.789 --> 29:46.188
A day or two. Yeah.

29:46.291 --> 29:47.291
If nothing shows,
then we'll move on...

29:47.425 --> 29:48.624
Okay.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.025
Dead and homeless.

29:53.157 --> 29:55.723
Jack street in brooklyn.
Christeson's down there.

29:55.824 --> 29:56.724
Strangle?

29:56.823 --> 29:57.726
- Sounds like a beating,
actually.

29:57.825 --> 29:59.026
- Red-ribbon tied
around the wrist?

29:59.126 --> 30:00.727
- Actually, it was more of
a burnt sienna and it

30:00.861 --> 30:02.029
was lashed around his dick.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.627
Fuck do I know?
Get down there.

30:03.727 --> 30:07.961
- Jay, this doesn't
sound like...

30:08.060 --> 30:09.995
Waste of your time, huh?

30:16.094 --> 30:18.196
- That what you have seen
here today is indicative

30:18.297 --> 30:20.766
of the progress that city
schools are making under

30:20.865 --> 30:22.298
this current administration.

30:22.398 --> 30:24.498
Now I know the governor has
had some harsh things to

30:24.598 --> 30:27.631
say about baltimore schools,
but I find that to be cynical

30:27.731 --> 30:28.898
and disappointing.

30:29.031 --> 30:31.298
The fifteen-point jump in
third-grade test scores

30:31.398 --> 30:33.033
is a trend that
can't be ignored.

30:33.133 --> 30:35.702
- But we've seen third grade
scores rise before, Mr. Mayor.

30:35.801 --> 30:38.834
And it doesn't seem as if any
gains in that grade can be

30:38.934 --> 30:42.035
sustained into fifth and
seventh-grade scores.

30:42.166 --> 30:44.936
- Kathy, you know,
we are committed to

30:45.068 --> 30:46.902
substantive change in baltimore.

30:47.003 --> 30:50.368
The kids that you saw today in
this citywide debate...

30:50.468 --> 30:52.736
They are achieving at
a high school level and

30:52.871 --> 30:56.738
disproving any negative
stereotypes about the city

30:56.838 --> 30:57.872
school system.

30:57.973 --> 31:01.371
Could you excuse me for
a moment, please?

31:01.572 --> 31:02.905
Major colvin.

31:03.004 --> 31:04.504
Just colvin.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.341
- You know,
I always wanted to say

31:10.442 --> 31:13.174
how sorry I am
how things turned out.

31:13.274 --> 31:15.174
There wasn't anything that
I could have done

31:15.308 --> 31:16.975
with your experiment
in the western district.

31:17.074 --> 31:18.143
There wasn't anything
that anyone could have

31:18.242 --> 31:19.276
done with that.

31:31.912 --> 31:35.645
- Yeah, well, I guess,
mr. Mayor, um...

31:35.745 --> 31:37.612
There's nothing to be done.

31:54.149 --> 31:57.149
- Mr. C, you know
the mayor, too? Dag.

32:01.183 --> 32:03.518
- I can't even believe
i'm talking to you, gus.

32:03.650 --> 32:05.719
After that shit you pulled.

32:05.819 --> 32:07.218
See that's how you all do.

32:07.285 --> 32:09.118
Slam somebody an' then
come back the next day

32:09.253 --> 32:11.085
like it never happened.

32:11.185 --> 32:13.419
It's jus' bidness, nerese.

32:13.551 --> 32:16.988
It was your turn to read
about yourself.

32:17.086 --> 32:21.022
Now, if carcetti's governor
and you become mayor...

32:21.121 --> 32:22.822
Is bond gonna run against ya?
Or is he done?

32:22.989 --> 32:24.154
What do you think?

32:24.255 --> 32:26.155
- After the clay
davis farce...

32:26.255 --> 32:29.256
He smells like he's done to me.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.190
There's rumor that keiffer
want the job, too.

32:32.189 --> 32:34.923
- I'll deal with that
as it comes.

32:35.089 --> 32:37.257
- What about this
daniels fella?

32:37.357 --> 32:39.994
You think he's ready
to run the copshop?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.626
It's kinda ugly the way
he kept puttin' a knife

32:41.726 --> 32:43.026
to burrell like that.
I mean...

32:43.125 --> 32:44.292
- You know I read that and
wondered where the hell

32:44.392 --> 32:45.425
you people got it from.

32:45.526 --> 32:46.960
What do you mean?

32:47.060 --> 32:49.425
- I was behind burrell
until the moment I wasn't.

32:49.526 --> 32:50.995
And if he had someone
backstabbing him

32:51.093 --> 32:52.260
at city hall...

32:52.360 --> 32:53.462
I'd've heard about it.

32:53.562 --> 32:57.395
Daniels wasn't even
on my radar.

32:57.562 --> 32:58.662
- Daniels didn't
undercut burrell?

32:58.796 --> 33:00.629
- Shit, at the end,
after his name was floated,

33:00.728 --> 33:09.195
daniels went around saying
he didn't want the job.

33:09.330 --> 33:11.031
Talk about it.

33:13.099 --> 33:15.266
- Well, he's been beat
pretty good,

33:15.399 --> 33:16.901
but I've got neck bruising too,
so it could be

33:17.033 --> 33:18.766
an attempted strangle.

33:22.232 --> 33:23.935
- No ribbon?
- Nope.

33:24.068 --> 33:27.203
- Bite marks?
- Not that I can see.

33:27.302 --> 33:29.102
This fuckin' guy stinks.

33:29.202 --> 33:30.401
He probably evacuated.

33:30.502 --> 33:32.336
- What?
He left and he came back?

33:32.436 --> 33:34.069
No, he shit himself.

33:36.203 --> 33:38.236
It's not my guy.
Sorry, rook.

33:38.337 --> 33:40.670
He's all yours.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.270
- And does the governor
think that's a problem,

33:42.403 --> 33:44.073
that it's something that
needs to be addressed?

33:46.539 --> 33:47.807
Hold on a sec...

33:47.940 --> 33:49.273
- You got the military records
back from the marine corps?

33:49.373 --> 33:54.040
- Three weeks at least,
they said.

33:54.138 --> 33:55.506
Sorry about that.

33:58.007 --> 33:59.808
- Hey steven,
I gotta little problem.

33:59.908 --> 34:01.676
- Well, it's common
in men your age.

34:01.776 --> 34:03.977
- I need to get into
walter reed.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.010
I gotta talk to
a vet down there.

34:06.109 --> 34:08.610
The fella that was with
our homeless vet

34:08.708 --> 34:09.844
when he saw that firefight.

34:09.945 --> 34:12.478
The one templeton was
writing about.

34:12.577 --> 34:13.643
- Why do we want to
go back on that?

34:13.744 --> 34:15.143
- I just want to talk
to a guy.

34:15.243 --> 34:17.011
Homeless fella gave me the name
said he's in-patient down there.

34:17.143 --> 34:20.279
- Afr the "post" series
blew up walter reed's shit?

34:20.378 --> 34:22.614
If you tell them you're
a journalist,

34:22.715 --> 34:23.614
you're dead to them.

34:23.714 --> 34:24.614
Yeah, I know.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.047
You know somebody
down there, right?

34:26.179 --> 34:27.246
Not at the hospital.

34:27.380 --> 34:28.280
A neighbor of mine
is with a-w-two.

34:28.413 --> 34:29.347
What?

34:29.447 --> 34:30.547
- The army's wounded
warrior program.

34:30.646 --> 34:32.545
She could get you in,
if you're not actually

34:32.649 --> 34:33.547
writing a piece.

34:33.648 --> 34:34.547
I'm not.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.083
What are you doing, gus?

34:37.116 --> 34:39.216
Scratching an itch.

34:39.350 --> 34:40.783
- I do Miss the
shift-change parties.

34:40.882 --> 34:42.216
No you don't.

34:42.315 --> 34:43.949
You never missed a
fucking one of them.

34:45.485 --> 34:48.451
- That was one sweet bust you
people put on Marlo Stanfield.

34:48.551 --> 34:49.717
My number right?

34:49.818 --> 34:51.484
I mean, it definitely
smells like a lester

34:51.583 --> 34:52.753
Freamon wiretap.

34:52.853 --> 34:55.053
I watched the news,
all that dope on the table.

34:56.022 --> 34:58.021
I swear, carv,
I was fully erect.

34:58.153 --> 34:59.887
- Your dick got hard?
How could you tell?

34:59.989 --> 35:01.487
- 'Cause the head was
poppin' out of the back

35:01.587 --> 35:02.854
of your neck.

35:03.854 --> 35:05.786
Seriously, it was a
wiretap, right?

35:05.887 --> 35:08.489
- Seriously, I couldn't fuckin'
tell you if I knew, herc.

35:08.588 --> 35:10.423
- So what're you saying?
My phone number wasn't shit?

35:10.523 --> 35:12.624
- Ah, what do you want me
to fuckin' say, herc?

35:12.724 --> 35:13.924
You're the tits.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.590
Without your little
contribution,

35:15.724 --> 35:19.059
the whole fucking city
slips into the chesapeake bay.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.725
Better?

35:21.758 --> 35:23.324
So you grew up there?

35:24.524 --> 35:26.491
Well, when did your family
move to baltimore?

35:26.591 --> 35:28.293
- Reginald.
You down there?

35:28.425 --> 35:29.360
yes.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.694
Come to the steps.

35:35.828 --> 35:37.327
Got a coupla things for you.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.193
Soap, deodorant and the like.

35:40.294 --> 35:41.962
- 'Preciate that.
Usin' the washer basin

35:42.063 --> 35:43.196
to clean up.

35:43.295 --> 35:44.965
And to pee in.

35:45.064 --> 35:47.797
- Don't worry,
I rinse it out.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.130
I was wonderin'...

35:49.230 --> 35:50.564
I got this anniversary comin
up, at the meetin' place.

35:50.631 --> 35:52.463
Sometimes kin folk
come along

35:52.596 --> 35:53.932
to show support.

35:54.032 --> 35:56.131
I was wonderin',
maybe you could...

35:56.231 --> 35:57.665
- It's hard for me to make
plans with my schedule

35:57.766 --> 35:59.264
at the hospital.

36:00.765 --> 36:02.667
- We got a little
celebration after.

36:02.766 --> 36:04.435
Thinkin' I could cook us
some dinner.

36:04.534 --> 36:05.668
I mean wouldn't be
a fancy thing,

36:05.768 --> 36:07.768
mac and cheese, like that,
but I guarantee it'll

36:07.901 --> 36:08.835
be good to you.

36:08.935 --> 36:10.234
We'll see.

36:11.434 --> 36:13.234
Okay.

36:19.471 --> 36:20.604
My sister.

36:20.738 --> 36:23.237
She good people.

36:23.336 --> 36:32.139
Been through a lot though,
you know?

36:32.305 --> 36:33.271
Levy.

36:33.372 --> 36:34.338
'scuse me?

36:34.472 --> 36:36.173
Levy. The lawyer.

36:36.273 --> 36:38.140
I know who he is.

36:38.206 --> 36:39.809
I'm not looking for
any lawyers.

36:39.909 --> 36:41.309
I'm following the money.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.608
Follow the lawyers.

36:42.708 --> 36:44.141
Levy, bronfman,

36:44.274 --> 36:46.008
silverstein, cray...

36:46.109 --> 36:48.474
All those guys who take
the high-end drug work.

36:48.575 --> 36:50.844
They don't just make money
off the criminal fees.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.509
- How's he...
- The lawyers?

36:52.610 --> 36:53.945
They the ones who make
a path for all this

36:54.045 --> 36:55.444
street-corner money.

36:55.578 --> 36:57.411
They showin' all these
kingpin motherfuckers

36:57.544 --> 36:59.778
how to sd it overseas,
bring it back,

36:59.877 --> 37:01.378
invest the shit.

37:01.478 --> 37:03.079
They the ones who
these ignorant ghetto

37:03.178 --> 37:04.579
motherfuckers always
listen to when

37:04.713 --> 37:06.079
it comes to cash money.

37:06.178 --> 37:08.412
And levy, man,
he got the most grease.

37:08.545 --> 37:11.213
- So levy routes
it through who?

37:11.314 --> 37:14.348
- Anyone who got a project
or a game in need of cash.

37:14.448 --> 37:17.181
Developers, people lookin'
to capitalize,

37:17.281 --> 37:19.248
elected folk
like myself.

37:19.348 --> 37:21.281
Shit, there's a lotta people
out here need a dollar

37:21.414 --> 37:22.514
now an' then...

37:22.615 --> 37:23.914
- And the lawyers
take their cut.

37:24.015 --> 37:26.816
- On both ends,
though I got to say,

37:26.916 --> 37:29.385
he gonna let you rob one
of his clients only so much.

37:29.485 --> 37:31.684
I mean once you get
a barksdale or

37:31.785 --> 37:32.985
a joe stewart on the hook,

37:33.084 --> 37:34.852
you want to go deep
on they ass.

37:34.951 --> 37:38.152
Levy'll let you get a taste,
but he won't let you run wild.

37:38.252 --> 37:39.919
'cause once you get past these
motherfuckin' lawyers,

37:40.020 --> 37:42.086
yocan really play the pimp.

37:42.185 --> 37:44.554
This one time,
I had this fella named bell

37:44.655 --> 37:47.054
hooked up on this howard
street condo thing,

37:47.154 --> 37:48.657
got him so that he
wasn't runnin' his shit

37:48.756 --> 37:49.822
past the lawyer...

37:49.922 --> 37:53.822
Boy, I tell u,
we bled that mother fucker...

37:53.889 --> 37:56.187
Lawyers, huh?

37:56.288 --> 37:58.688
- Oh, most definitely,
detective.

37:58.789 --> 37:59.924
me?

38:00.024 --> 38:02.093
Shit, I'm just small potatoes.

38:02.191 --> 38:05.291
Just a workin' politician
from walbrook junction,

38:05.392 --> 38:08.224
tryin' to make his way
from this world into the next.

38:13.259 --> 38:16.127
- What else can you
give me on levy?

38:16.226 --> 38:18.526
- Nothin' other than
what I have.

38:18.626 --> 38:20.095
I ain't up in his
business or nuthin'.

38:20.227 --> 38:21.360
I just takin' what he throws.

38:21.461 --> 38:22.462
Bullshit.

38:22.563 --> 38:24.596
You got something
solid or I'm on my way

38:24.696 --> 38:25.864
to the u.s. Attorney.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.896
- You ain't nuthin'
but a shakedown artist.

38:33.062 --> 38:34.930
How's this...

38:35.997 --> 38:39.632
Levy got someoneat the courthous

38:39.799 --> 38:40.966
oh, hell yeah.

38:41.066 --> 38:43.066
Levy been buyin'
papers now for years

38:43.198 --> 38:45.034
and sellin' 'em to
whoever needs an early look.

38:45.134 --> 38:49.266
And don't think there ain't
no real money in that.

38:49.433 --> 38:50.700
A prosecutor?

38:50.800 --> 38:52.433
- I don't have a name.
Truly I don't,

38:52.566 --> 38:54.701
but it seems to me,
you start lookin' at

38:54.802 --> 38:56.736
the people hangin'
around the grand jury,

38:56.836 --> 38:58.437
you'll find I'm right.

39:00.137 --> 39:09.671
Now I know I've said
enough to buy my case back.

39:09.772 --> 39:22.240
You know, you could
buy a round, too.

39:22.275 --> 39:34.710
You know, you could
buy a round, too.

39:34.810 --> 39:36.476
I get you?

39:38.476 --> 39:40.510
Nah, feels good, hubert.

39:40.642 --> 39:45.646
You dig in there,
you got a mind to.

39:45.846 --> 39:48.579
You admiring my hand, si

39:48.680 --> 39:50.379
oh, call me gus.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.648
- It's hard to
get out the habit.

39:53.814 --> 39:55.014
- That's pretty
damn lifelike.

39:55.115 --> 39:56.647
Yeah.

39:56.747 --> 39:58.847
Prosthetic digits.
Five of 'em,

39:58.947 --> 40:00.147
individually controlled.

40:00.247 --> 40:02.116
I got my key grip...

40:03.282 --> 40:06.118
And my power grip...

40:07.851 --> 40:10.717
My precision grip...

40:10.817 --> 40:12.883
And my index point.

40:15.283 --> 40:19.187
These new models got a
thumb that rotates,

40:19.286 --> 40:20.887
which makes
all the difference.

40:20.988 --> 40:22.953
Used to be you just had
this one grip,

40:23.054 --> 40:24.486
right here for everything.

40:26.419 --> 40:28.689
- You got your...
- Not yet.

40:28.821 --> 40:32.988
- Brave new world.
- Yeah.

40:33.088 --> 40:34.454
Do you mind if I...?

40:39.324 --> 40:43.124
- The a-w-two lady says
you weren't writin' no story.

40:43.223 --> 40:46.524
- No, I'm just verifying
details of one we already

40:46.657 --> 40:47.623
printed in my newspaper.

40:47.757 --> 40:48.723
Profile of your buddy.

40:48.857 --> 40:51.925
- Terry.
- Hmm-hmm.

40:52.093 --> 40:54.794
- Yeah, he come down
visit me every coupla weeks.

40:54.894 --> 40:57.493
He takes that peter pan bus
down from baltimore.

40:57.627 --> 41:00.293
Walks a couple of miles
down georgia avenue

41:00.426 --> 41:02.828
from the silver
spring terminal.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.194
He's having some
trouble as you know.

41:08.294 --> 41:09.895
Did you read the article?

41:11.196 --> 41:12.229
Yeah.

41:12.329 --> 41:14.832
Man who wrote it got
some stuff right.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.998
Terry was pissed,
I tried to play it off,

41:18.131 --> 41:20.131
make him good with it.

41:20.230 --> 41:22.197
- What did the story
get wrong?

41:22.297 --> 41:24.797
- Well, that day wadn't
no black hawk down thing.

41:26.133 --> 41:27.799
You know, when shit
went bad...

41:27.902 --> 41:29.701
After I lost my hands,

41:29.801 --> 41:31.134
them habudabi
motherfuckers weren't

41:31.233 --> 41:33.834
even around after
the shit went off.

41:33.934 --> 41:35.767
That's how they do.

41:35.866 --> 41:37.136
How you doin', marino?

41:37.234 --> 41:38.835
Outstanding.

41:39.935 --> 41:41.070
Let me ask you this.

41:41.201 --> 41:43.201
Could terry have exaggerated?

41:44.634 --> 41:47.536
Why not?
If he got wound up say...

41:47.637 --> 41:48.971
nah.

41:49.072 --> 41:52.073
You lie about combat
because you weren't there.

41:52.172 --> 41:54.604
And terry was.
Two tours.

41:54.738 --> 41:56.538
He's got stories
if he wants 'em.

41:56.638 --> 41:59.473
Just not on that day.

41:59.572 --> 42:01.305
He ain't lie,
y'all did,

42:01.405 --> 42:02.941
sorry t'say.

42:08.107 --> 42:10.474
- Kima, what the fuck
are you taking about?

42:18.975 --> 42:20.644
- I'm sayin' you made a
mistake letting mcnulty

42:20.744 --> 42:23.311
run your people from one case
to the other like you did.

42:23.445 --> 42:24.411
Why? What's the big deal?

42:24.478 --> 42:26.445
- Their run sheets,
office reports.

42:26.545 --> 42:27.778
Mcnulty covered them, right?

42:27.912 --> 42:30.377
- So fuckin' what?
They did police work.

42:30.478 --> 42:32.510
They did good fuckin'
police work, in fact.

42:36.716 --> 42:38.981
Your guys...

42:39.082 --> 42:40.948
You coach 'em good, ellis.

42:41.048 --> 42:42.447
You let them know when
i.i.d. Comes callin'

42:42.548 --> 42:44.048
that their answer is
that they didn't know

42:44.181 --> 42:46.016
anything about it,
that they did what

42:46.184 --> 42:48.515
they were told and they
turned in clean run sheets,

42:48.582 --> 42:50.116
and they don't know
what anyone else sent

42:50.215 --> 42:51.415
upstairs for staff review.

42:51.515 --> 42:52.982
Know about what?

42:59.585 --> 43:01.385
- When you spoke up
on colicchio...

43:01.518 --> 43:04.350
How did that feel?
- Like shit.

43:04.452 --> 43:05.351
You okay with it?

43:05.451 --> 43:06.584
It was a forced move.

43:06.652 --> 43:08.086
Tony lost it.
He was around the bend.

43:08.220 --> 43:10.353
But are you okay with it?

43:16.988 --> 43:19.089
Ninety-two q jams.

43:19.189 --> 43:21.657
The most hip-hop and r & b.
It's your girl neke here...

43:21.756 --> 43:23.156
We got our peoples

They big, they fat,

43:25.522 --> 43:26.723
What up, porkchop?

43:26.823 --> 43:28.791

With what they be chargin'

43:31.692 --> 43:36.325

43:36.492 --> 43:37.392
You can go.

43:37.492 --> 43:39.092
Where to?

43:39.225 --> 43:40.726
- Sayin' you can leave
the car with me.

43:40.792 --> 43:43.094
You rent by the night, right?

43:43.195 --> 43:50.196
- I ain't seen no
medium of exchange.

43:50.361 --> 43:53.495
Look, when you done,

43:53.627 --> 43:54.597

43:54.696 --> 43:56.430
Hmm-hmm.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.666
- Oh, my god.
Look at this.

44:15.965 --> 44:17.168
Bubs.

44:21.937 --> 44:23.735
- Well, you're welcome

44:23.836 --> 44:26.136
But I have to ask that
you respect the privacy.

44:26.234 --> 44:28.904
No notetaking,
no recorders,

44:29.004 --> 44:31.236
what you hear today
stays in the room.

44:31.336 --> 44:34.269
- Not a problem.
I'm just here with reginald.

44:34.403 --> 44:35.903

44:36.003 --> 44:37.672

44:37.772 --> 44:39.139

My name is...

44:56.342 --> 44:58.542

44:58.642 --> 44:59.676
Round the way

44:59.776 --> 45:01.374
Hey, bubbles.

45:01.476 --> 45:03.978
I'm a drug addict.

45:05.112 --> 45:06.710
Celebratin' my anniversary.

45:18.580 --> 45:21.379
My people couldn't
make it here tonight.

45:21.479 --> 45:25.412
I left a trail
of fire behind me.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.848
Time gonna make it right
with them, I guess.

45:27.948 --> 45:28.983
That's right, it will.

45:29.117 --> 45:31.217
- Same thing get me
right with myself.

45:33.050 --> 45:34.083
Couple a days ago,

45:34.183 --> 45:35.883
I took a walk down
in druid hill park,

45:35.983 --> 45:37.651

45:37.752 --> 45:39.383
You know how that
time be like,

45:39.518 --> 45:42.184
with the sun throwin'
shadows an' all.

45:42.317 --> 45:44.617
Got me thinkin'
'bout when I was a young man,

45:44.751 --> 45:46.519
sittin' in that park.

45:46.618 --> 45:49.887
You know, watchin' the girls,
smokin' on a little herb,

45:49.987 --> 45:51.453
drinkin' a cold beer.

45:52.653 --> 45:54.820
You know where this is goin'.

45:56.154 --> 45:58.587
I had this moment where,
you know,

45:58.686 --> 46:01.489
I was wantin' to
feel that way again.

46:01.621 --> 46:02.621
I remembered,
what y'all said,

46:02.755 --> 46:03.857
if the urge was to come,

46:03.958 --> 46:06.124
call a group member
up and talk.

46:06.224 --> 46:09.289
First thing I called walon up,
him bein' my sponsor an' all,

46:09.388 --> 46:12.358
turns out he's on a ride
with his motorcycle club.

46:13.924 --> 46:17.724
So I pulled out that sheet
that got passed out...

46:17.824 --> 46:21.127
Dialed a few numbers,
couldn't get an answer.

46:21.227 --> 46:23.927
I left a coupla messages,
but nobody called me back.

46:24.027 --> 46:25.495
You didn't call me.

46:25.627 --> 46:27.994
'cause I would have got up
with you, reginald.

46:28.094 --> 46:29.727
You can believe that.

46:34.495 --> 46:36.229
Well, anyway...

46:37.697 --> 46:39.530
I didn't get high.

46:44.729 --> 46:46.898
See, I knew if I did
I wouldn't get that

46:46.998 --> 46:48.599
good feelin' back that
I was daydreamin on.

46:48.698 --> 46:50.765
- That's right.
That's right.

46:50.865 --> 46:53.031
- It got me thinkin'
about a friend of mine...

46:56.733 --> 46:58.435
Boy named sherrod.

47:00.168 --> 47:05.034
I been carryin' his passin'
for a long while.

47:05.201 --> 47:06.868
Like that memory I had
about those summer days

47:06.968 --> 47:08.803
in the park.

47:09.969 --> 47:12.004
Thinkin' on that make me smile.

47:13.937 --> 47:19.238
With sherrod,
it's more of a hurt.

47:19.337 --> 47:30.273
But not as...
Not so bad like it was.

47:30.373 --> 47:34.841
Ain't no shame in holdin'
on to grief.

47:34.941 --> 47:37.242
As long as you make room
for other things, too.

47:43.008 --> 47:44.675
It's alright.

47:47.911 --> 47:49.778
So thank you for listening.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.711
Thank you for
lettin' me share.

47:53.810 --> 47:54.780
Thanks for sharing.

48:19.950 --> 48:21.252
Where my gun?

48:21.351 --> 48:29.486
- In the trap.
You get it when we set up.

48:32.552 --> 48:34.519
- A detective is here
to see you.

48:34.619 --> 48:36.153
Greggs, I think she said.

48:44.321 --> 48:46.222
What? What's the matter?

48:54.056 --> 48:55.491
- How you all even know
if Walter behind everybody

48:55.625 --> 48:57.725
gettin' jacked?

48:57.825 --> 49:00.658
I mean, ain't you
all ever wonder

49:00.758 --> 49:02.290
if he even deserve
any of this shit?

49:02.424 --> 49:04.492
- Deserve got nuthin'
to do with it.

49:04.593 --> 49:06.226
It's his time that's all.

49:15.495 --> 49:17.529
- Yo, pull over in that
alley right there.

49:17.629 --> 49:19.029
I gotta piss sumpin' fierce.

49:19.129 --> 49:21.495
- You better piss in that
cup right there on the floor.

49:21.595 --> 49:22.595
- Man, I'm gonna
need ten cups.

49:22.695 --> 49:24.395
Yo, pull over, Snoop.

49:35.032 --> 49:43.366
- What now, motherfucker?
You shy?

49:43.566 --> 49:47.334
Smart nigga.
You always was.

49:47.434 --> 49:48.568
How you know?

49:48.667 --> 49:51.836
- Y'all taught me.
Get there early.

49:51.936 --> 49:54.702
Why? What I do wrong?

49:54.836 --> 49:57.501
- Chris locked up behind
somethin' he done for you.

49:57.602 --> 49:59.203
You downtown with the police.

49:59.301 --> 50:00.301
I ain't say a word.

50:00.401 --> 50:01.704
Yeah, that's what you say.

50:01.804 --> 50:03.204
But it's how
you carry yourself.

50:03.303 --> 50:04.806
Always apart.

50:04.906 --> 50:07.072
Always askin' "why"
when you should be doin'

50:07.173 --> 50:08.572
what you told.

50:09.971 --> 50:13.873
You was never one of us.
You never could be.

50:22.641 --> 50:25.044
How my hair look, Mike?

50:26.309 --> 50:28.609
You look good, girl.

50:52.379 --> 50:54.413
- They're sayin' the
only o.t. That anyone

50:54.512 --> 50:56.314
has been sing has been
through getting

50:56.415 --> 50:58.184
detailed on the
homeless killings.

50:58.285 --> 50:59.184
They say that's the case.

50:59.284 --> 51:00.550
And no wiretaps up?

51:00.683 --> 51:01.817
I asked about that.

51:01.918 --> 51:03.316
And I'm hearing,
off-the-record kinda,

51:03.416 --> 51:04.983
that it was a wire.

51:05.083 --> 51:06.883
And it makes sense,
'cause that's how Lester works.

51:06.982 --> 51:09.149
He gets hold of a number
and works it to death.

51:09.250 --> 51:10.884
Ere he would get the
number I have no idea...

51:11.018 --> 51:12.921
- But a wiretap is hours,
and you say no one

51:13.020 --> 51:14.386
is making any money...

51:14.486 --> 51:15.986
- Fuckin' department's
more fucked up than even

51:16.086 --> 51:17.253
I remember it.

51:22.421 --> 51:23.821
Where you been at, Mike?

51:23.954 --> 51:25.387
You gotta see this.
There's a serial killer,

51:25.487 --> 51:28.154
but he only be killin'
other serial killers...

51:28.288 --> 51:29.322
- Yo, yo.
We about take a ride.

51:29.422 --> 51:30.589
You ain't got no whip.

51:30.688 --> 51:31.822
- Just gather your stuff,
both of y'all.

51:31.923 --> 51:33.523
Come on, we gotta move quick.

51:35.090 --> 51:37.257
Come on. Let's go!

51:37.357 --> 51:38.523
Okay.

51:39.690 --> 51:41.590
- But that means...
All the calls to

51:41.689 --> 51:42.623
the newspaper.

51:42.722 --> 51:45.292
The photographs
of the missing man.

51:45.391 --> 51:47.594
We have a wiretap...
McNulty has a...

51:47.693 --> 51:49.493
On a cellphone.

51:49.593 --> 51:50.960
Jesus Christ.

51:53.026 --> 51:54.792
He wouldn't dare.

51:54.892 --> 51:56.029
What's the number?

51:57.994 --> 51:59.662
It's on the paperwork...

52:08.997 --> 52:10.430
Come on.

52:10.530 --> 52:12.564
Where...

52:12.697 --> 52:14.697
Evidence control.

52:44.704 --> 52:46.071
- I always thought you
were bullshittin'

52:46.238 --> 52:48.237
'bout havin'
an aunt out here.

52:48.305 --> 52:49.971
She expectin' him.

52:51.770 --> 52:54.371
An' what's in this box.

53:01.507 --> 53:04.442
It's nice here, huh?

53:09.908 --> 53:11.640
Let's go, bug.

53:16.112 --> 53:17.579
Wish't I was going with you.

53:17.678 --> 53:19.711
You gonna have your own room.

53:19.811 --> 53:23.178
She probably got one of
them plasma t.V.'s, too.

53:23.311 --> 53:25.312
Them joints is wet.

53:34.447 --> 53:35.681
Let's go.

53:54.651 --> 53:57.585
OK, give that to aunt Carla.

53:57.684 --> 54:00.284
Tell her there's more behind
it when she finds the need.

54:00.384 --> 54:01.719
A-ight?

54:04.588 --> 54:08.021
Make sure she cop you
some fresh things, too.

54:10.721 --> 54:13.289
I don't need you going
to a new school lookin' all...

54:23.690 --> 54:25.692
Come on, now.

54:25.758 --> 54:34.924
A man don't be sheddin'
no tears.

54:35.024 --> 54:36.627
Go on, bug.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.666
- Bring it up front for
re-seal when you're through,

55:12.769 --> 55:14.336

55:14.435 --> 55:15.435

55:21.937 --> 55:23.103
Beats workin'.

56:05.346 --> 56:07.181
Why here?

56:11.512 --> 56:15.679
Why you wanna mix

56:15.813 --> 56:17.279
They give me work.

56:19.015 --> 56:20.448
Who you talkin to?

56:21.850 --> 56:34.516
I know what they be doin'
in there, duke.

56:34.618 --> 56:38.619
- I could still hang with you,
then.

56:38.719 --> 56:39.919
You know I'm too hot.

56:58.589 --> 57:01.489
- You remember that one day,
summer past?

57:01.588 --> 57:05.725
When we threw them piss
balloons at them terrace boys.

57:05.824 --> 57:10.358
You remember? Just before
school started up again...

57:10.490 --> 57:14.359
Y'know, I took a beatdown
from them boys,

57:14.459 --> 57:16.460
I don't even throw
a shadow on it.

57:18.195 --> 57:19.727
That was a day...

57:19.860 --> 57:21.393
Y'all bought me ice cream
off the truck.

57:22.693 --> 57:24.060
You remember, Mike?

57:33.264 --> 57:35.562
