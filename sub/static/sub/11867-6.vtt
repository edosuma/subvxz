hard, going from liaison
to head of GB.

ALLISON: Well, I'll admit
it was a bit of a rough start,

00:06.632 --> 00:08.293
but I think I'm getting
the hang of this job.

00:08.383 --> 00:10.669
I mean, things are actually
calm at Global for a change.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.459
No, don't! Don't even...
Don't tempt fate.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.090
Oh, I don't believe
in fate, Carter.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.842
No, just stop.
Honestly?

00:15.891 --> 00:17.722
I'll turn around.
I'll run home,
take a shower.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.760

take a shower. You know
my water heater's broken.

"Is there anything
this guy can't do?"

00:34.326 --> 00:36.863
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm thinking.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.490
Do you want a drink?

00:39.581 --> 00:42.914
Sure, yeah. Is it
too early for happy hour?

00:44.586 --> 00:47.919
Well, if you consider
Vincent's Veggie Blend
happy, then no.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.250
Well...

00:49.341 --> 00:52.424

in mind, but here's
to quiet afternoons.

construction, or you got
a pest problem.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.595

a pest problem.

you guys home so soon.

Oh, Kev's helping me
install a new system
for his music therapy.

01:13.782 --> 01:16.819
Well, I offered to fix
Allison's water heater.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.825

01:19.121 --> 01:22.113
Interesting
Allison didn't mention
it's a fusion water heater

01:22.374 --> 01:25.616

you need a PhD from MIT.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.411
Hmm.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.800
I better go.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.802

for the run.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.179
Yeah, thanks for
the happy hour.

you can lean up?

it's standard procedure

I had last night.

How are you feeling?

talk about it.

and you were naked,

to share the same dream?

07:15.602 --> 07:18.719
Yeah, I need coffee before
I can contemplate that.

07:20.315 --> 07:23.648
Maybe we've developed a deep,
subconscious connection.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.309
Yeah.
Like soldiers in battle.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.479

I can tell you that
there's still plenty.

Oh, well, that truck
contains six months' worth
of hazardous material.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.586
Without our distillation
and scrubbing process

08:30.677 --> 08:32.668
that much waste
could fill Lake Erie.

down to just the

12:30.291 --> 12:33.203
Guess Jake and l have
a few things in common.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.034
Same pay grade. G3.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.376
A dancer.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.874
What's that?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.799
I wanted to be a dancer.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.802
Really?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.269
Really.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.430
Wow. What happened?

12:55.942 --> 13:00.311
You grow up with
three brothers and no mom,
you learn to survive.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.732
Well, your secrets
safe with me.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.661
Josephina Ballerina.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.246
I will Taser you.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.822
Hey, who's the employer
on that check you got
over there?

13:13.001 --> 13:14.241
Um...

13:16.421 --> 13:17.831
G.D. Why?

13:18.589 --> 13:22.298
I got a Descartes Delivery
for 30 hours last week.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.216
Jake's been moonlighting.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.340
Which means he was
probably working nights.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.671
Maybe he fell asleep
at the wheel.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.675
(MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY)

13:54.000 --> 13:56.707
(LONG SUSTAINED BEEP)

14:00.715 --> 14:03.422
WOMAN ON P.A.: Trauma team
to ICU. Trauma team to ICU.

14:04.886 --> 14:08.754
Stay with me. All right,
stay with me, buddy.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.684
Clear.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.769
(MACHINE CHARGING)
MAN: Come on, stay with me.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.228
Clear.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.282
Okay, shock him again.
Charge to 400.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.734
Clear.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.538
Okay, that's it.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.034
Time of death, 7:40 am.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.350
I don't understand.
You said he was
gonna be fine.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.308
In traumatic injuries,
it's difficult to see
the extent of the damage.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.770
And we won't know
why he stopped breathing
until I've done an autopsy.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.315
I'll tell you why.
Because he died
in the dream.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.779
I saw the crash.
You tried to save him,

15:12.954 --> 15:14.490
and then I felt
him slip away.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.947
Fargo, that was a dream,
and, given your accident,
it's not surprising.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.865
Just to be clear,
Fargo didn't have
an accident.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.747
He avoided an accident.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.457
The point is,
I dream he dies,

15:23.506 --> 15:25.121
a second later
he's flat-lining.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.832
We frequently incorporate
external stimuli
into our dreams,

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
music, alarm clocks.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.469
Yeah, you probablyjust
heard the EKG, Fargo.

15:32.974 --> 15:36.762
Hold on. Excuse me?
What do you think?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.146
You think that's
what happened?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.226
Actually, no.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.603
Okay. Any particular
reason why?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.484
Because I had
the exact same dream.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.279
SO did I.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.074
Honey, keep
your voice down.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.329
Don't tell me
what to do.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.961
Okay, you want to run
that by me again?

16:06.174 --> 16:09.257
Fargo and the head nurse
and three residents
who sleep in the lounge

16:09.343 --> 16:12.927
across the hall all shared
the same dream
about Jake's death.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.254
ALLISON: How can that be?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.839
Well, we don't know,
but they're not the only ones
who are sharing dreams.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.849
JO: We've been getting
domestic disturbance
calls all morning.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.187
Like what?

16:20.813 --> 16:22.849
(SCREAMING)
Get her off me!

16:23.191 --> 16:24.852
Like that.
Honey, it was
just a dream.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.523
Yeah. Jo, do you mind?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.605
Fine, but you're gonna
get the next one?
Yeah.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.152
How do you like
my husband now?

16:32.742 --> 16:34.073
Okay, what's
going on?

16:34.160 --> 16:37.493
We don't know.
But we think it's tied
to the chemical spill.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.698
Okay. Why?

16:38.789 --> 16:41.917
Well, before it happened,
dreams weren't contagious.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.044
Dreams can't be
contagious, Carter.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.504
Well, normally
I'd agree with you,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.504
but since it's happened
to Jo and me and Fargo

16:48.549 --> 16:50.835
and a boatload
of other people,

16:50.885 --> 16:53.001
I am gonna have
to say they can.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.345
Now, the crash site
was close to a stream.

16:56.641 --> 16:59.303
I mean, maybe
the spill contaminated
the water supply.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.055
No, Eureka's water treatment
system would have detected it.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.140
Unless someone
didn't want it to.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.813
You're the one
who brought up sabotage.

17:05.900 --> 17:09.017
All right, I'll have someone
look at it while Henry's
doing the autopsy.

17:09.070 --> 17:13.780
But there is no way
that a contagious dream
killed Jake Wyatt.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.243
It's Eureka.
Stranger things
have happened.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.406
There have been
legitimate studies done
on shared dreams.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.953
CARTER: So it is possible?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.077
To an extent. Subjects focused
on the same topic
to induce shared dreaming

17:24.168 --> 17:28.036
with some success,
but they never had
the exact same dream.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.626
What you're talking about
is unprecedented.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.212
And what are you
working on here?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.136
I'm developing
a dream spectrometer.

17:38.975 --> 17:42.684
It maps the electrical impulse
patterns of a person's dreams.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.681
Layman's terms, Doc.
What's the upshot?

17:44.772 --> 17:48.560
If dreams were television,
then this would be
the written transcript.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.940
Really?
Yeah.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.602
What's this one about?

17:52.697 --> 17:53.777
I have no idea.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.948
At this stage, it's kind of
like trying to decipher
a new language.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.109
We're working on it.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.777
What about studies related
to dreams and death?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.037
What about them?

18:03.124 --> 18:05.115
Well, is there any evidence
that dying in your dream

18:05.209 --> 18:07.291
can cause your death
in real life?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.827
In bad Hollywood horror
movies, maybe,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.913
but in reality,
absolutely not.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.880
Are you certain?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.833
I'd bet my life on it.

18:22.143 --> 18:23.804
Kevin!

18:27.481 --> 18:29.142
Nathan?

18:31.986 --> 18:32.975
Kevin?

18:33.946 --> 18:36.483
Kevin, honey,
where are you?

18:37.742 --> 18:40.984
Kevin? Kevin, honey,
where are you?

18:41.037 --> 18:42.993
I'm right here, Mom.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.116
Kevin!

18:47.001 --> 18:49.333
Why didn't you answer me?
You had me worried.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.502
I'm sorry, Mom. I wanted
to show you something.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.787
Well, where are we going?

18:52.840 --> 18:53.829
It's a secret.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.833
Honey, it's late,
and I still need to
make dinner.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.172
It'll only take a minute,
I promise.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.889
Are you ready?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.513
I don't know, Kevin.
What's in there?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.553
Everything.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.470
It worked, honey.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.060
It worked.

20:02.493 --> 20:06.111
CARTER: If you guys can
form a line this is gonna go
much more smoothly.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.951
If you guys could just
come together,
it will be efficient.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.499
It would be
the right way to...
Okay, now! Who's next?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.872
He sold our research.
He took all the credit!
I didn't even sell it!

20:14.922 --> 20:16.423
Oh, right.
I dreamed
of selling it, okay?

20:16.507 --> 20:18.338
That doesn't count.
Okay, and I'm supposed
to trust you now?

20:18.426 --> 20:19.916
Yes, you are.
Oh, give me a break.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.420
WOMAN 1: I didn't
slander her.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.877
WOMAN 2: You called me
ajackass.

20:22.930 --> 20:25.046
It was a dream!
In front of the entire
cryogenics team.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.761
I meant it as a term
of endearment.
I have 20 witnesses

20:27.810 --> 20:29.095
who will back me up.
You are so sensitive.

20:29.270 --> 20:30.885
I didn't cheat.
I swear.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.975
You copied my test answers
verbatim, and now
we're both suspended.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.022
Okay, well, you know, copying
dream answers shouldn't count.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.941
It does when the teacher
dreamed you stealing them.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.689
It’s getting
out of hand, Henry.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.986
How many more
shared dreams?

20:41.073 --> 20:44.110
Hundreds. People are
getting too freaked out
to sleep.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.741
Yeah, did the autopsy
turn up anything?

20:45.786 --> 20:48.243
The truck driver?
Nothing obvious.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.158
I mean,
he just stopped breathing.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.205
All right, let's take
a look at where
the dream-sharers live.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.874
CARTER: Maybe
it's location-based.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.041
A// right.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.832
And where’s the spill?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.298
JO: Not even close.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.588
Maybe it got into
the water supply?

21:03.637 --> 21:04.797
No, I did that test myself.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.552
There was no presence of CNS
stimulants, psychotropics,

21:08.642 --> 21:10.633
or anything that would
explain it.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.600
What are we missing?

21:33.167 --> 21:34.657
Nathan.
Hey.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.751
Just checking
some readings.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.171
We have to stop.

21:44.178 --> 21:45.258
Okay, why?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.927
Other people are
sharing dreams.

21:47.473 --> 21:51.261
Allison, we'll be lucky
if this works on Kevin,
much less anyone else.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.260
Did it?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.479
Did it work?
That's not the point.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.186
Of course
it's the point.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.352
We're trying to figure out
Kevin's connection
to the artifact.

22:02.446 --> 22:06.359
You said you would
give anything to know what's
going on inside his head.

22:06.450 --> 22:09.362
I've spent months
trying to give that to you.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.494
Did it work?

22:18.295 --> 22:21.332
There has to be
some connection
among these people.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.008
Or a disconnection.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.755
What?

22:29.431 --> 22:31.387
No dreams were
shared in here.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.346
Where is that?

22:36.021 --> 22:38.637
Now, here's your
double-double no-foam
Sumatran latte.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.563
Now, that should keep
you awake for a while.

22:40.651 --> 22:41.891
CARTER: Vincent.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.896
Shenﬁ.

22:44.113 --> 22:48.231
Have you had any
odd dream experiences
in the last couple of days?

22:48.325 --> 22:51.408
Sadly, no. I seem to be
missing out on all the fun.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.320
Believe me,
it's not so much fun.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.996
Where do you sleep?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.414
Upstairs in the loft.

22:57.459 --> 23:00.587
I like to be close, in case
I get the midnight urge
to baste something.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.291
Could we book your cafe
for the night?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.418
Sure. You having a party?

23:08.470 --> 23:10.552
We were here,
in your lab,

23:10.598 --> 23:13.931
and he was just this normal
kid, happy and excited.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.725
And he wanted to show me
something in the back.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.685
What was it?

23:18.772 --> 23:20.933
I don't know.
It was like a vault.

23:21.025 --> 23:24.017
I woke up before
we had a chance
to go inside,

23:24.111 --> 23:27.444
but when I asked him,
he said it was everything.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.190
I think he might
be right.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.195
I don't understand.

23:33.287 --> 23:38.281
For centuries, we've been
searching for a unifying
theory of everything.

23:38.584 --> 23:43.294
A zero-point energy field
containing all knowledge
and experience

23:43.339 --> 23:45.170
from the beginning
of time.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.297
You're talking
about the Akashic Field.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.466
Yes, and I think

23:50.220 --> 23:53.178
the artifact is
the antenna for
that field.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.465
Are you saying that Kevin...

23:56.936 --> 24:00.224
Of all the people exposed
to the artifact explosion,

24:00.397 --> 24:03.139
his was the only system
that didn't overload.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.519
His brain is wired
like no one else's.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.940
Somehow, I think he's

24:09.281 --> 24:12.944
created a connection
to the field, where
the rest of us can't.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.494
What am I supposed
to do now?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.369
Let Kevin show you
what's inside the vault.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.838
CHILDRESS: Head to toe,
people. Head to toe.

24:27.925 --> 24:30.166
And, yes,
we still have space
behind the counter.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.800
VINCENT: Oh, man,
she's good.

24:31.845 --> 24:35.508
So, Jack, I'm still not clear
what your little experiment
is meant to accomplish.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.014
Well, we know that Cafe Diem
is a dream-free zone.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.426
Everybody gathered here
has been sharing dreams,

24:40.521 --> 24:42.807
so we're gonna test whether
it's the place or the people.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.064
Okay, so either everyone
will finally get
a good night's sleep,

24:46.151 --> 24:48.688
or we could share
the most horrifying dream
experience ever.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.897
Yes.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.815
All right, Sheriff,
we've maximized
the potential of our space.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.071
Good. Glad you're on that.

24:58.163 --> 25:01.246
All right, people,
lights out.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.418
What? No story?

25:03.544 --> 25:04.704
Don't make me
come over there.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.207
FARGO: You really want
to add police brutality
to the list?

25:07.256 --> 25:09.212
Just go to sleep, Fargo.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.899
I love watching him sleep.

25:31.739 --> 25:35.823
Seems like just
any other normal kid.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.361
Do you really want
him to be like
any other normal kid?

25:43.917 --> 25:45.248
Sometimes.

25:46.587 --> 25:47.793
There's nothing wrong
with that.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.246
Then why do I feel
so guilty about it?

25:50.716 --> 25:52.923
You want what's
best for your son.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.881
We both do.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.759
Do we really?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.888
I don't know, I...

26:04.021 --> 26:07.934
I think you're still
fixated on the artifact
and your theory of everything,

26:07.983 --> 26:10.349
and I think

26:11.612 --> 26:14.445
that I just want the feeling
that I had last night.

26:16.450 --> 26:20.159
In Kevin's dream,
we were so connected,
so normal.

26:21.121 --> 26:24.363
He's always been
so different and brilliant.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.700
And for the most part,
I love that about him.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.368
But different is hard.

26:29.463 --> 26:32.125
Brilliant is hard.
Hell, normal is hard.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.499
And with everything else,
it...

26:38.514 --> 26:40.630
So what do you want
to do now, Allie?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.307
I want to protect my son.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.474
Me, too.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.103
But not at the risk
of everyone else.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.518
We have to stop.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.566
And we have to
tell Carter.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.319
Allison, listen to me.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.117
Whatever is happening
in this town,

26:59.159 --> 27:02.492
that signal is
not the cause.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.075
Then, turn it off,
and tomorrow we'll know.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.175
NO.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.447
Allison.

27:40.534 --> 27:42.365
Nathan, I've made up
my mind.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.908
So have I.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.996
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hey, guys.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.201
Kind of busy.
Yeah.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.242
I need to talk
to Allison.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.042
About what?

27:53.088 --> 27:55.295
About this.

27:56.383 --> 27:58.169
Way to cut to the chase,
Shenﬁ.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.425
Direct, focused,
efficient. Kudos!

28:00.512 --> 28:03.754
Oh, dear, that approach
lacked confidence.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.719
It was too tentative.
No woman likes that.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.641
True.
Shocker.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.887
Try it again, this time
with confidence.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.016
Hold her face
with one hand.

28:12.065 --> 28:13.350
Pull her in closely
with the other.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.563
The goal is efficiency
of movement to achieve
maximum results.

28:16.653 --> 28:20.066
I think we may have
different goals.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.402
I'll make it easy for you.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.789
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

30:40.172 --> 30:41.207
Oh, my God.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.371
(EXCLAIMS IN SPANISH)

30:42.549 --> 30:44.210
Fargo.
That could have been
anyone's dream.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.248
Right.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.380
Yeah, well, actually
he's got a point.

30:47.471 --> 30:51.134
Oh, and I suppose that
that whole kissing mess wasn't
Carter's dream, either.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.885
Hey, it wasn't a mess!

30:53.143 --> 30:55.008
Actually...
Nobody's asking you.

30:55.062 --> 30:56.393
Or you!

30:58.899 --> 31:03.734
All right, so we've ruled out
the waste, the water,
and the location.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.196
It's got to be us.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.103
We're gonna
have to start testing people
as soon as possible.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.032
All right, everybody,
we're moving to Global.

31:13.789 --> 31:18.123
Hey, Dad, this woman
won't wake up.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.242
Sheriff, this one's
out, too.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.411
Yeah, I've got
one over here.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.667
They're unconscious.
We have to get them
to the infirmary.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.623
All right, everybody,
collect your stuff
in an orderly fashion.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.460
We're going to move out
to Global, all right?
As quick as we can. Go!

31:32.015 --> 31:34.392
Thanks, I got it,
the pressure.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.262
That couldn't have hurt
any more, huh?

31:36.311 --> 31:37.721
CARTER: Hey! Tell me
you found something.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.057
I went back,
reviewed the autopsy
and discovered that Jake Wyatt

31:40.107 --> 31:43.144
had abnormally high levels
of acetylcholine
in his spinal fluid.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.771
Which is?
A neurotransmitter.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.402
A chemical that allows
your neurons to communicate
and your muscles to flex

31:47.447 --> 31:48.903
and is essential
to dreaming.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.439
So the dream
did kill him?

31:50.492 --> 31:54.110
No, but elevated levels
have a devastating effect
on neural function

31:54.204 --> 31:56.536
and ultimately lead to
the loss of muscle control,

31:56.623 --> 32:00.241
in this case, his diaphragm.
He suffocated in his sleep.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.994
l have a sinking feeling
I know where this is going.

32:04.089 --> 32:07.707
That's right. All the latest
victims have high levels,
including you.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.632
And those levels are rising.

32:12.139 --> 32:15.723
Let's work a little faster.
Jo, I'm gonna go talk
to Paul Suenos.

32:16.017 --> 32:18.349
Even if you could
share dreams,

32:18.437 --> 32:20.268
it wouldn't cause you
to slip into a coma.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.974
Well, six more people
are unconscious

32:22.023 --> 32:25.481
and a lot of others
are headed in that direction,
including me.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.277
Okay, what can I do?

32:29.823 --> 32:30.812
Uh...

32:31.116 --> 32:33.903
First we need to separate
the dreamers
from the dreamees.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.827
If I hook people up
to my spectrometer,
we might see a difference

32:36.872 --> 32:38.487
in brain activity
during REM sleep.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.164
The dreamers would
likely experience more
than the watchers.

32:41.251 --> 32:44.664
Good. Good.
Okay, we're talking about
hundreds of people.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.584
Considering I only have
two prototypes,
that could take weeks.

32:51.553 --> 32:53.464
You have two
of these things?
Mmm-hmm.

32:53.889 --> 32:55.504
Where's the other one?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.176
Right in here.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.342
It's gone.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.183
I told her
to get a nanny cam.

33:04.941 --> 33:05.930
CARTER: Thanks!

33:08.278 --> 33:10.394
Allison!
Carter.

33:12.407 --> 33:14.693
I need to talk to you.
Yeah, me, too.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.781
Look, I know what's
causing the shared dreams,

33:18.872 --> 33:21.363
and you have
to stay calm.

33:24.044 --> 33:27.536
It's the music thing
that Stark put
in Kevin's room.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.166
I know.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.670
You know?
I should've
told you sooner.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.550
Yeah, you should've
told me!

33:35.222 --> 33:36.678
You're protecting Stark,
instead of the town!

33:36.723 --> 33:38.930
No, I told him
to turn it off
last night.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.348
He was just trying
to help me.

33:40.393 --> 33:42.520
Help you what?
To protect Kevin.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.391
To understand what's
going on in his head,
and it worked.

33:45.482 --> 33:46.847
Well, that's great,

33:47.400 --> 33:49.061
but you put yourself first,
and a man died.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.232
Not from what
we put in that room.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.528
Well, you lied.
You lied to me!
I know and I'm sorry!

33:53.573 --> 33:56.610
Look, something
is happening to Kevin.
He is changing.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.408
And it terrifies me.

34:01.373 --> 34:04.490
You tell me that you wouldn't
do the same if it was Zoe.

34:08.004 --> 34:11.462
I think it's time to
get Stark to explain
what the hell he did.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.172
Don't you?

34:14.761 --> 34:17.343
The receiver l adapted
from Suenos's device

34:17.514 --> 34:20.972
visually interprets
electrical impulses
created during REM sleep.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.141
So, why's it messing with
our acetaminophen levels?

34:23.228 --> 34:24.968
Acetylcholine.
Don't push me.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.897
There's no reason
it would affect one person,
much less half the town.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.648
How many people show
elevated levels?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.145
Fifty, total.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.568
Fifty, even?

34:33.613 --> 34:34.898
Yeah. So?

34:35.365 --> 34:36.855
Jo, you were taking
the dream statements,
right?

34:36.950 --> 34:39.362
Yeah, and I had around
50 different dreams

34:39.452 --> 34:40.612
that were shared
by everyone else.

34:40.704 --> 34:42.365
Well, they're the sources
of the dreams.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.411
I mean,
that's why their acetylcholine
levels are so high.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.038
Okay, so what do we know
about these 50 people?

34:46.126 --> 34:48.037
Oh, but my name
isn't on there.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.208
That's a good thing, Fargo.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.788
I know, because it means
I wasn't the one who had
the man in black dream.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.966
Well, it sure as hell
wasn't me.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.340
Oh, God.

35:00.432 --> 35:04.016
CARTER: Focus. Jake, you, me,
we're all on the list, right?

35:04.352 --> 35:06.388
So, we're searching his house.
What do we find
we have in common?

35:06.479 --> 35:10.188
None of us realized
ourfull potential?

35:11.776 --> 35:14.233
Well, yes, but we're also
the same pay grade.

35:14.321 --> 35:18.690
G3. Right, can you
run this list and tell me
who else is G3?

35:20.785 --> 35:21.820
All of you.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.155
So, 50 people,
all the same pay grade,

35:23.204 --> 35:25.331
all with cranked levels of...
Acetylcholine.

35:25.415 --> 35:27.201
Thank you. That's got
to mean something, right?

35:27.292 --> 35:29.499
G3 refers to work schedule,
not pay level.

35:29.586 --> 35:33.579
All the jobs have set hours,
so overtime doesn't compromise
safety or security.

35:33.673 --> 35:34.913
Like truck drivers?

35:35.008 --> 35:39.047
Yes, or reactor technicians,
weapon test specialists,
network engineers.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.553
The network.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.597
What about it?

35:44.809 --> 35:48.017
Childress was saying
she was working on some
sort of neural network?

35:48.104 --> 35:52.063
Yes, she's beta-testing
a system of distributed
computing with humans.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.102
Okay. But given that
Stark's dream receiver

35:56.196 --> 35:58.107
isn't powerful enough
to cause shared dreaming,

35:58.198 --> 36:00.530
could the neural network
be used as an amplifier?

36:00.617 --> 36:02.232
It's possible.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.908
We should
shut it down.
JO: Carter?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.371
Yeah?
Do it fast.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.535
You're not coming?

36:07.248 --> 36:09.864
I would, but I can't
move my legs.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.382
HENRY: We'll take care
of you. Don't worry.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.804
Okay.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.224
You should go
with the others.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.893
I'd rather stay with you,
if you don't mind.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.973
No. No, I don't mind.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.069
CHILDRESS: We all
sleep a third
of our lives away.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.698
I figured, why not find
a way to use our brains
during our downtime.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.574
Yeah, sure, why not?

36:46.454 --> 36:50.197
I created a wireless network
of test subjects
with regular sleep schedules.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.831
Yeah, G3 employees.

36:51.918 --> 36:52.907
Yeah.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.494
See, everyone's brainwaves
have a distinct signature.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.000
Theirs are programmed
into the network,
so when they're asleep

36:58.091 --> 36:59.922
I can tap into their minds
from this computer

36:59.968 --> 37:02.505
and use the combined power
to problem-solve.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.387
Wait a second.
You're taking
people's brain power?

37:06.933 --> 37:09.925
No, Sheriff, just tapping
into unused potential.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.935
And it's in everyone's
contract that they may
be randomly selected

37:12.981 --> 37:14.972
for double-blind case studies
from time to time.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.522
Is it?
I told you to read
your contract

37:16.609 --> 37:18.270
carefully before
you signed it.

37:18.319 --> 37:22.232
And I'm guessing you've
randomly tapped into, say,
50 of them?

37:22.282 --> 37:24.819
Exactly.
They're essentially
wireless transmitters.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.946
And everything we dreamed
has been networked
to everyone else.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.743
It doesn't work that way.
Not by itself.

37:29.789 --> 37:33.077
But in combination
with Dr. Stark's
dream device maybe.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.959
But why the sudden buildup
of acetylcholine?

37:36.045 --> 37:37.125
Probably lack of sleep.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.714
No, the people in the study
were selected based on

37:38.798 --> 37:40.379
the regularity
of their sleep patterns.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.458
Yeah, but Jake's been
secretly doing double shifts

37:42.552 --> 37:45.589
and no one in town's been
sleeping normally this week.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.717
I'll shut down
the network immediately.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.299
That won't solve
the buildup of acetylcholine
in the test subjects.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.388
Their bodies are
overproducing the compound,

37:53.480 --> 37:55.311
like a hyperactive gland.

37:55.482 --> 37:57.598
If you can cleanse the system
of the compound entirely

37:57.650 --> 37:59.231
it may reset the body's
rate of production.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.479
Okay, good. Let's do that.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.607
The excess neurotransmitters
are acting like toxins
in your body

38:03.656 --> 38:06.147
and I have no idea
how we scrub that out.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.823
So, G.D. has the most advanced
waste reduction system
in the world,

38:10.872 --> 38:13.284
but we can't clean
this stuff out of us?

38:15.418 --> 38:16.874
Maybe we can.

38:20.173 --> 38:21.663
You've got
to be kidding me.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.002
It's an oxygenation
filtration system.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.512
It should remove
the excess acetylcholine
from your system.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.885
In theory.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.341
In theory.

38:29.390 --> 38:33.258
Once you're inside,
we'll flood the chamber
with an oxygen-rich plasma.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.139
It's gonna take
a moment to adjust.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.769
You have to breathe the fluid
into your lungs

38:36.856 --> 38:39.347
but the chemical reaction
will do the rest.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.729
And if it doesn't?

38:42.529 --> 38:44.269
You'll drown.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.439
Well, this just gets
better and better.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.858
NATHAN: Just breathe in,
Carter. Slow and easy.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.239
You have to take fluid
into your lungs.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.705
All right, we have to
get him out of there.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.004
Wait.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.588
ALLISON: Nathan,
he's going to drown.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.175
Come on, Carter.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.516
His acetylcholine levels
are dropping.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.193
NATHAN: Oxygen's on the rise.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.736
He's gonna be okay.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.567
He's gonna be fine.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.240
And we have a cure,

40:13.286 --> 40:16.528
which means we can keep moving
fonNard with our research.

40:25.465 --> 40:28.081
Let's get everyone up here
and get them in treatment
as soon as possible.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.552
Morning, Henry!

40:40.855 --> 40:42.595
Hey, Jack,
how you feeling?

40:42.649 --> 40:44.640
Well, I got
a total-body enema.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.560
Thank you for that
very vivid image.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.696
Actually, I'm just glad
to have my dreams
back to myself.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.273
Yeah, I think a lot of people
feel the same way.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.282
Those were some
disturbing images, huh?

40:55.328 --> 40:59.742
Yes, that one
of your birthmark is
particularly haunting.

41:01.834 --> 41:06.328
You know, there was one
that was so familiar,
it was like deja vu.

41:07.340 --> 41:10.503
You, me, we're in the garage,
and you said,

41:10.885 --> 41:12.671
"I'll make it easy for you."

41:13.096 --> 41:16.759
And there was
a big flash of light.

41:17.266 --> 41:18.255
Hmm.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.015
I don't know.
Dreams are funny
that way.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.692
Yeah.

41:26.776 --> 41:27.982
Sports?

41:28.277 --> 41:31.519
Yeah! You know me so well.
