00:06.033 --> 00:13.033
A subtitle by R3V0LV3R.

00:17.331 --> 00:20.698
Okay. We are so late, Charlie!

00:21.802 --> 00:23.667
George is gonna kill us for sure this time.

00:24.004 --> 00:27.235
Okay, come on, baby.
Let's go, let's get out.

00:29.309 --> 00:31.869
George, I'm so sorry,
but you know Charlie's been colicky,

00:31.945 --> 00:33.503
and he woke up at, like,
4:00 a.m. with a fever,

00:33.580 --> 00:35.013
and, of course,
I didn't have anything to give him,

00:35.082 --> 00:36.640
and on top of that,
the drug store was closed,

00:36.717 --> 00:39.777
- so I had to drive all the way to...
- Just save it, okay, Violet?

00:40.987 --> 00:42.113
You're looking awful.

00:42.422 --> 00:44.151
Well, I feel awful.

00:45.359 --> 00:46.451
Okay, just listen to me...

00:46.526 --> 00:48.118
No, no, no, don't start up with that.

00:48.261 --> 00:52.129
There's nothing you can say that I haven't
heard at least a million times before.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.732
I've done what I can to help you out here,

00:55.802 --> 00:57.269
you being a single mom and all, but...

00:57.337 --> 00:59.362
I know, George, and I
appreciate everything...

00:59.473 --> 01:01.202
Just let me finish, okay?

01:01.508 --> 01:02.839
The bottom line is...

01:06.513 --> 01:07.605
Who's that?

01:07.681 --> 01:09.410
Your replacement.

01:10.150 --> 01:11.242
George, I need this job...

01:11.318 --> 01:13.149
I need someone that I can count on

01:13.353 --> 01:16.379
to show up, maybe even on time
every once in a while.

01:18.024 --> 01:20.891
Look, I've given you
a lot of chances here, Violet.

01:22.829 --> 01:24.319
But I got a business to run, okay?

01:24.398 --> 01:26.093
I know you do.

01:27.768 --> 01:29.702
But I don't have any savings,

01:29.770 --> 01:34.139
and between formula, and diapers,
and medicine, I can't...

01:34.207 --> 01:37.574
I've already advanced
you two weeks' salary.

01:38.145 --> 01:41.637
The best I can do is just
forget you even owe me.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.147
Appreciate that.

01:49.356 --> 01:50.380
Yeah.

01:50.457 --> 01:53.517
Well, would it be okay, you think,
if I stay in the back room?

01:53.593 --> 01:54.821
Just till I get something else?

01:54.895 --> 01:56.328
Back room comes with the job.

01:56.396 --> 01:58.261
You know that, Violet.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.357
The new girl, she...

02:01.902 --> 02:03.028
She's got her stuff in the car,

02:03.103 --> 02:05.765
and she wants to move in
at the end of her shift, so...

02:10.877 --> 02:12.174
Violet...

02:15.115 --> 02:17.140
it's gas money.

02:17.451 --> 02:21.581
Help you and Charlie get on up the road.

02:49.683 --> 02:50.672
Have a great day.

02:54.254 --> 02:56.051
- Hi!
- Dot!

02:56.122 --> 02:58.181
How are you?

02:58.258 --> 03:00.385
Perfect, now that you're here.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.827
You know, I had forgotten
how pretty Constant Harbor is.

03:03.897 --> 03:06.024
A little less so in the middle of winter.

03:07.234 --> 03:09.668
I have to admit, I was surprised when

03:09.736 --> 03:12.068
you decided to stay on
after your mom passed away.

03:12.138 --> 03:14.299
I mean, I thought you would have
sold her little shop

03:14.374 --> 03:18.276
and gone back to your
fancy Seattle law firm.

03:18.345 --> 03:20.711
Practicing law here's the
same as in the city,

03:20.780 --> 03:24.341
except the egos and the settlements
are quite a bit smaller.

03:26.219 --> 03:27.652
Oh, my goodness.

03:28.121 --> 03:30.783
- We are all ready to go, aren't we?
- Yup.

03:30.957 --> 03:33.152
And I got to tell you how much I appreciate

03:33.226 --> 03:37.322
you ending your book tour
with a signing in my little shop.

03:37.397 --> 03:40.833
Come on, now. Any excuse to come visit you.

03:40.901 --> 03:43.369
We've hardly even spoken to each other
since the wedding.

03:43.436 --> 03:45.870
Yeah, which was...

03:45.939 --> 03:48.635
What, a year already?

03:48.708 --> 03:50.175
A year today.

03:50.243 --> 03:53.007
And you're spending your first anniversary
with me instead of your hubby?

03:53.079 --> 03:55.809
Well, you are my college roommate,
but I have to tell you,

03:55.882 --> 03:59.249
if King were not stuck
covering a tournament on the East Coast...

03:59.319 --> 04:00.343
Say no more.

04:00.654 --> 04:03.020
As long as we get to catch up.

04:03.089 --> 04:06.115
Which will have to wait. We gotta go.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.289
- Go?
- To the radio station.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.261
A celebrity like you
comes into town, and...

04:10.330 --> 04:13.060
Well, you've got to suffer an interview
with the local literary critic.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.429
Don't worry.

04:15.502 --> 04:17.697
Lester is a pussycat,

04:17.771 --> 04:21.468
and the good news is,
he had to buy your book to review it.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.406
- Come, come, come, my dear darling one.
- You silly thing.

04:43.597 --> 04:45.724
I thought I could manage, Zach.

04:45.799 --> 04:47.528
I really did.

04:53.540 --> 04:56.236
But now I don't know what I'm gonna do.

05:00.113 --> 05:02.104
Need a hand moving your stuff out, Violet?

05:02.182 --> 05:04.673
No, we're okay, George, thanks.

05:06.252 --> 05:08.447
Okay, yeah, Charlie.

05:15.629 --> 05:18.564
And our very special guest
today is relationship columnist

05:18.632 --> 05:21.726
and best-selling author Peyton MacGruder.

05:21.801 --> 05:24.099
Welcome to Book Faire, Peyton.

05:24.170 --> 05:26.070
Thank you, Lester. It's nice to be here.

05:26.539 --> 05:29.337
You've been writing an advice column,
"The Heart Healer,"

05:29.709 --> 05:31.438
for a newspaper in North Carolina.

05:31.511 --> 05:32.739
That's right.

05:32.812 --> 05:38.079
And now you have edited your columns
into a sort of "best of" compendium?

05:38.985 --> 05:40.714
Inspired by my husband.

05:40.954 --> 05:44.617
King Danville,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning sports writer.

05:45.659 --> 05:47.183
Yes, he convinced me that

05:47.260 --> 05:51.356
people beyond my regular subscribers
might find them interesting.

05:52.065 --> 05:54.795
Well, you've been on
best-seller lists all over the country,

05:54.868 --> 05:57.200
so, I guess King was right.

05:57.303 --> 06:00.602
Yes, I guess he was, much to my surprise.

06:00.674 --> 06:03.074
Although, don't tell him I admitted that.

06:05.345 --> 06:06.369
No, you don't!

06:06.446 --> 06:09.040
No, you don't! Don't you take
that child out of his car seat!

06:09.115 --> 06:10.480
Burt's gonna be home any second now.

06:10.550 --> 06:12.484
You know how he gets
around bawling babies.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.017
Yeah, nice to see you, too, Ma.

06:19.926 --> 06:22.952
Night shifts and crying kids don't mix.
You can understand that.

06:23.430 --> 06:28.129
I understand all right, about Burt's moods,
more than you want to know.

06:28.334 --> 06:29.961
Don't you start, Violet.

06:30.036 --> 06:32.027
Burt ain't much, but he's all I got.

06:32.338 --> 06:34.704
I got nothing and I still don't envy you.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.868
What is it you came for, Violet?

06:39.813 --> 06:42.281
Well, I thought you might like
to see your grandson, is all.

06:42.348 --> 06:43.815
You can't con me, girl.

06:44.017 --> 06:45.848
Don't even try.

06:47.087 --> 06:48.452
I got fired this morning.

06:48.555 --> 06:51.319
I'm surprised the old geezer
kept you around as long as he did.

06:51.391 --> 06:54.224
Look, I think
I'm coming down with something.

06:54.294 --> 06:57.058
Charlie's still really colicky
and he won't sleep.

06:57.130 --> 06:59.189
I got no place to live,
and less than $30 to my name,

06:59.265 --> 07:00.323
and a baby to feed.

07:01.234 --> 07:03.725
Maybe it's time to face facts.

07:03.803 --> 07:06.465
Give Charlie to someone
who can care for him.

07:08.007 --> 07:11.443
- Mommy, please...
- I don't have any money to give.

07:11.511 --> 07:14.446
If I did, I would, which is why
you came by here in the first place,

07:14.514 --> 07:16.038
'cause I'm a sucker.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.913
Now, you get into that truck
and you get out of here

07:17.984 --> 07:20.748
before Burt gets back
and we both end up homeless.

07:31.164 --> 07:35.498
We only have a few minutes left, Peyton,
to talk about your column on

07:35.568 --> 07:39.800
making tough decisions
under impossible circumstances.

07:39.873 --> 07:41.465
So, let me ask you...

07:41.908 --> 07:43.603
What was I thinking, Charlie?

07:43.676 --> 07:45.507
Asking her for help.

07:45.578 --> 07:52.381
Has there been a time in your own life
when circumstances left you unable to cope?

07:55.388 --> 07:56.446
Yes.

07:57.757 --> 08:00.590
And how did you react to the situation?

08:02.529 --> 08:07.626
I relied on the advice of a loved one.

08:08.368 --> 08:11.337
And if you hadn't had
that person's guidance?

08:13.039 --> 08:16.600
My life would have definitely
taken a different path.

08:19.345 --> 08:23.611
But then again, we have all had doors
slammed in our faces, haven't we?

08:24.384 --> 08:26.818
Sometimes over and over again.

08:26.886 --> 08:28.581
Amen to that!

08:28.655 --> 08:31.453
When we meet someone
who's suffering through the dark days,

08:31.524 --> 08:35.015
the right thing to do is to
make yourself available, to listen,

08:35.094 --> 08:39.621
to counsel, to support,
and maybe just hold a hand.

08:39.866 --> 08:42.096
God knows, Charlie,
we could use all of the above.

08:42.168 --> 08:46.366
But if you would like to
meet Peyton MacGruder in person,

08:46.439 --> 08:50.205
she will be signing copies of her new book
Notes From the Heart Healer,

08:50.276 --> 08:53.336
this afternoon, at The Constant Bookworm,

08:53.413 --> 08:55.404
in Constant Harbor, Washington.
Thank you so much.

08:55.481 --> 08:59.850
What do you think, Charlie?
God trying to get our attention?

09:09.662 --> 09:11.926
- Sorry about that.
- What?

09:11.998 --> 09:14.523
Well, I saw your face
when Lester started getting personal.

09:14.601 --> 09:18.128
And I know exactly which difficult
situation you were thinking about.

09:18.238 --> 09:19.603
Yup, I guess you do.

09:19.672 --> 09:23.438
Anyhow, you did a nice job of avoiding
the subject of your father's lousy advice.

09:32.819 --> 09:35.879
I just adored the chapter on,
"Loving the Person in the Mirror."

09:36.256 --> 09:38.781
it made me think about myself
in a whole new way.

09:39.259 --> 09:42.092
Well then, you are the reason
I wrote this book.

09:42.295 --> 09:43.592
Thank you.

09:43.663 --> 09:45.153
Thank you.

09:48.067 --> 09:49.364
- Hi.
- Hi!

09:50.336 --> 09:52.236
I heard you on the radio today.

09:52.305 --> 09:53.932
I liked what you had to say.

09:54.007 --> 09:55.736
Thanks.

09:55.808 --> 09:57.673
And your book sounds real good, too.

09:58.878 --> 10:02.473
Well, thank you.
So, are you from around here?

10:02.982 --> 10:04.006
No.

10:04.817 --> 10:06.910
Okay, what's your name?

10:06.986 --> 10:08.146
It's Violet.

10:08.221 --> 10:09.415
Violet.

10:15.461 --> 10:17.656
Ls everything okay, Violet?

10:19.699 --> 10:23.362
Did you mean it, what
you said on the radio,

10:23.436 --> 10:25.961
about helping people through rough times?

10:26.572 --> 10:27.834
Yes.

10:28.574 --> 10:29.666
Peyton!

10:29.742 --> 10:32.506
Sorry to interrupt,
but a fan of yours has arrived,

10:32.578 --> 10:35.308
and he's dying to say hello.

10:37.884 --> 10:40.409
King! Oh, my gosh.

10:41.387 --> 10:42.547
Wait just a minute, okay?

10:43.723 --> 10:45.588
Oh, my gosh!

10:46.926 --> 10:48.655
What a surprise.

10:50.163 --> 10:51.528
I thought you were on the East Coast.

10:51.597 --> 10:52.621
I canceled.

10:52.699 --> 10:55.395
I couldn't bear to be away from you,
not today.

10:55.468 --> 10:56.992
Thank you.

11:02.942 --> 11:06.309
Maybe we'd better be a little more discreet.
Somebody here might tell your husband.

11:06.412 --> 11:11.611
Trust me, this smart aleck is my husband,
King Danville.

11:13.753 --> 11:17.154
And today is our first anniversary,

11:17.223 --> 11:21.421
and his being here is a
total surprise to me.

11:22.795 --> 11:24.558
I'll bet that your co-conspirator

11:24.630 --> 11:27.292
in keeping everything a secret
is my sneaky friend... Where is she?

11:27.367 --> 11:29.267
Happy anniversary...

11:29.335 --> 11:31.860
Happy anniversary to you!

11:32.772 --> 11:34.000
Congrats, guys.

11:34.073 --> 11:35.904
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:39.679 --> 11:40.737
Thank you.

11:41.014 --> 11:42.641
Yes.

11:42.715 --> 11:47.311
Hey, let's cut that cake
and get it passed out, right?

11:47.387 --> 11:49.480
And buy the book.

11:49.555 --> 11:53.457
That's why we're here.
That's why we're here.

11:53.559 --> 11:54.651
I can't believe you're here.

11:55.228 --> 11:57.890
Ms. MacGruder seemed real nice, Charlie.

11:58.931 --> 12:04.631
I mean, I know I only met her for a second.
Hardly even exchanged a word, really.

12:04.937 --> 12:07.633
Sometimes, you can just tell, you know?

12:09.475 --> 12:12.103
I bet she would have helped us
if her husband hadn't shown up.

12:14.614 --> 12:18.106
If it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't
have any luck at all, huh, Charlie?

12:18.885 --> 12:20.113
That's gonna change soon,

12:20.686 --> 12:21.983
'cause it's gotta.

12:27.093 --> 12:28.651
That's the last of your formula,

12:30.430 --> 12:32.523
and we used the last of
our money to buy it.

12:32.598 --> 12:33.826
Mama...

12:36.769 --> 12:40.205
I know, baby. It makes me want to cry, too.

12:43.376 --> 12:46.834
Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

12:46.913 --> 12:50.280
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

12:50.349 --> 12:52.146
And if that mockingbird don't sing...

12:53.019 --> 12:56.978
I can't believe that they
call this a cottage.

12:58.124 --> 13:01.525
It's so perfect. How did you ever find it?

13:02.495 --> 13:05.760
Dot helped me out with that.

13:06.666 --> 13:08.463
And the champagne? How did you...

13:08.534 --> 13:10.764
Dot had it sent over.

13:11.971 --> 13:15.668
And what exactly do you intend
to contribute to the festivities?

13:16.642 --> 13:18.371
Well, let me think.

13:19.679 --> 13:20.737
There's this.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.244
Anything else?

13:31.657 --> 13:32.715
Well, there's dinner.

13:32.792 --> 13:36.023
I plan to contribute that, too.
In fact, I'll tell you what.

13:36.229 --> 13:39.687
While I run to the store,
why don't you pamper yourself,

13:39.765 --> 13:43.360
and when I get back, I will cook you
the best meal you have ever had.

13:44.403 --> 13:45.995
Before...

13:46.873 --> 13:48.135
Before what?

13:48.207 --> 13:50.266
Before my last contribution,

13:51.043 --> 13:54.877
which I'm going to need your help with.

13:55.748 --> 13:57.773
And that would be?

13:57.850 --> 13:59.579
Fireworks.

14:07.326 --> 14:09.692
I'm sorry.
It's just not gonna work out this time.

14:09.762 --> 14:11.559
Thank you. Thank you for coming out.

14:22.575 --> 14:25.635
- Three of these, and...
- That's nice.

14:26.412 --> 14:28.403
How about that? No?

14:30.283 --> 14:32.649
- No, I'm sorry.
- Thanks for your time.

14:42.328 --> 14:43.886
Hey, appreciate it.

15:05.017 --> 15:06.746
She's as fast as she is pretty.

15:07.119 --> 15:09.178
Just like my former wife.

15:09.388 --> 15:11.822
- Harry Barders.
- King Danville.

15:11.891 --> 15:13.290
- How you doing?
- Good.

15:13.359 --> 15:15.259
You in the market for a boat, King?

15:16.128 --> 15:17.459
- Is she for sale?
- Yup.

15:18.097 --> 15:21.624
Proceeds to be split between my wife
and the guy she ran off with.

15:21.701 --> 15:24.499
Ouch. Sounds like a sad story.

15:25.104 --> 15:27.197
Sad and sordid,

15:27.273 --> 15:29.264
but it could have a happy ending
for you, though.

15:29.342 --> 15:31.537
I'll make you a heck of a deal.

15:32.712 --> 15:34.577
There you go. Specs are on the back.

15:35.081 --> 15:39.347
If you like what you read, come on back, and
we'll let you take it out and kick the tires.

15:40.753 --> 15:41.947
Thanks.

15:43.222 --> 15:44.211
I'll do that.

16:03.276 --> 16:04.766
Hang on, baby.

16:56.128 --> 16:57.561
Wow.

16:57.897 --> 17:00.661
Do you buff up nice, or what?

17:02.234 --> 17:03.724
I try my best,

17:05.204 --> 17:08.173
but I fear I have competition
for your affection.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.231
She does have her charms,

17:10.643 --> 17:13.271
but they're nothing compared to yours.

17:17.049 --> 17:19.915
Then why is she taped to the refrigerator?

17:19.984 --> 17:23.546
Because she is for sale.

17:26.025 --> 17:27.049
And?

17:27.126 --> 17:32.359
And I thought she might be
fun for us to sail into our retirement.

17:32.798 --> 17:34.129
Retirement?

17:34.200 --> 17:38.660
Well, not right now, you know,
down the pike.

17:38.738 --> 17:42.265
Yeah, like, 15 or 20 years down.

17:42.341 --> 17:46.334
Well, it'll give us plenty of time
to hone our yachting skills.

17:47.680 --> 17:51.241
Okay, I'm glad you're
so concerned about our future.

17:52.785 --> 17:58.519
But wouldn't it be more exciting
to concentrate on the present?

18:03.629 --> 18:05.153
Yes.

18:24.283 --> 18:26.945
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming already!

18:31.223 --> 18:32.383
Hello?

18:33.426 --> 18:34.484
Hello?

18:35.394 --> 18:36.554
Hello?

18:38.564 --> 18:39.622
Violet?

18:39.832 --> 18:42.596
Violet, if you're on the other end
of this line, you say something.

18:43.002 --> 18:44.196
Violet!

19:02.621 --> 19:04.054
Happy anniversary, honey.

19:04.323 --> 19:07.759
Thank you, King, for
making this so special,

19:08.961 --> 19:11.293
and for being so special.

19:13.199 --> 19:16.191
And for your uncommonly good timing.

19:16.402 --> 19:18.597
You cooked, I'll clean.

19:33.152 --> 19:35.143
Your dad must be happy about
you getting accepted.

19:35.621 --> 19:39.387
Yeah. I'll be the first one in the family
to go to college.

19:46.532 --> 19:48.227
What are you doing, Vi?

19:49.935 --> 19:51.402
I'm pregnant, Zach.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.371
Are you mad?

19:57.009 --> 19:58.067
Mad?

19:59.245 --> 20:00.269
No.

20:02.047 --> 20:03.776
I love you, Violet.

20:04.884 --> 20:08.547
I want to marry you, have lots of babies,
just like we talked about.

20:08.621 --> 20:10.646
We talked about it after
you finished college.

20:10.723 --> 20:13.123
I'll still go, just not right away.

20:13.192 --> 20:15.183
Well, what about money?

20:15.261 --> 20:17.388
I mean, having a baby can't be cheap,

20:17.463 --> 20:19.658
and we don't have, like,
insurance or anything.

20:19.732 --> 20:22.599
Hey, you worry about having our baby.

20:22.668 --> 20:24.295
I'll worry about paying for it.

20:30.009 --> 20:33.945
Things are gonna turn out just
fine, Violet. You'll see.

20:40.252 --> 20:42.516
They haven't, though, have they, Charlie?

20:43.322 --> 20:45.950
Things haven't turned out fine at all.

21:16.255 --> 21:21.818
God, please let Peyton MacGruder
be true to her words.

21:27.499 --> 21:28.864
Dearest reader,

21:28.934 --> 21:32.335
it's unfair that life-changing decisions

21:32.404 --> 21:37.432
must often be made when we're young
and our well of wisdom is still shallow.

21:38.777 --> 21:45.182
I was asked this morning how I have made
such critical choices when at my weakest,

21:45.651 --> 21:48.415
emotionally and physically.

21:48.754 --> 21:52.918
Sadly, the answer is, "Not well."

21:54.893 --> 21:57.862
I can only suggest that,
no matter how difficult,

21:57.930 --> 22:03.232
we must strive to tap
what some call intuition

22:03.302 --> 22:05.793
and others call revelation,

22:06.605 --> 22:10.063
and by doing so, take responsibility

22:10.175 --> 22:12.735
no matter how things turn out.

22:14.246 --> 22:16.908
Be brave like your daddy was, Charlie.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.280
I'll get myself together
and come back for you.

23:03.062 --> 23:06.259
King? King, you'd better
come out here right now!

23:10.169 --> 23:11.659
King!

23:19.645 --> 23:20.703
Hey!

23:25.150 --> 23:26.742
That's my truck!

23:40.032 --> 23:42.626
"Please help me by
taking care of Charlie."

23:42.701 --> 23:45.534
That's it? That's all the note said?

23:46.939 --> 23:49.999
And you didn't see anybody, or hear a car?

23:50.275 --> 23:52.573
Nope. Whoever left the baby
had already taken off

23:52.644 --> 23:54.441
by the time I opened the door.

23:54.513 --> 23:56.037
Thanks.

23:56.615 --> 23:57.604
Well,

23:59.485 --> 24:02.682
Child Services can't get
anyone down here till next week,

24:02.755 --> 24:06.816
so if there's absolutely nobody
who can offer temporary foster care,

24:07.426 --> 24:10.987
I should take the kid down to Port Townsend
and leave him with the pediatric clinic.

24:11.163 --> 24:12.357
All alone, you mean?

24:12.431 --> 24:14.422
Well, they've got nurses
who'll keep an eye on him.

24:14.900 --> 24:17.198
Yeah, I know that, but you know...

24:17.269 --> 24:18.896
I can talk to Judge Gregor

24:18.971 --> 24:21.132
and see if she might appoint you guys
as interim caregivers.

24:21.640 --> 24:22.664
Us?

24:22.741 --> 24:26.040
No. No, no. I was thinking, you know,
maybe you could take him and...

24:26.111 --> 24:28.545
You've got to be kidding.
I don't know anything about babies.

24:28.614 --> 24:30.343
Well, you know as much as I do.

24:30.415 --> 24:32.178
Someone else raised my kid, remember?

24:33.285 --> 24:34.752
I think we should do it.

24:36.555 --> 24:39.922
Look, obviously,
whoever left him here chose us.

24:39.992 --> 24:42.756
He's a baby, not a May Day basket.

24:42.828 --> 24:47.128
You don't just select a house at random
and hope the people inside like kids.

24:47.199 --> 24:48.666
Got a point.

24:48.801 --> 24:51.531
I mean, it's more than likely
they chose you folks for a reason.

24:51.703 --> 24:55.195
Come on, honey. It'll be fun.
It's just for a couple days.

24:55.274 --> 24:58.471
Fun for you, maybe.
I do have a column to write.

24:58.544 --> 25:01.445
How can you find
a more perfect lead line than,

25:01.513 --> 25:06.177
"What would you do if somebody
left a baby on your doorstep?"

25:06.251 --> 25:08.719
She's right. Your editor will love it.

25:08.787 --> 25:09.879
Look, let me call the office,

25:09.955 --> 25:12.185
see if I can't wangle
a few days off for both of us.

25:12.591 --> 25:14.718
Great! Now that that's settled...

25:14.827 --> 25:16.556
Dot, wait I minute, I didn't say that...

25:16.662 --> 25:20.530
I will stop by the judge's house
on my way home, okay?

25:20.833 --> 25:21.925
- Dot...
- It's okay.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.766
Now, if you get any more visitors
in the night, you let me know.

25:25.838 --> 25:28.602
If not, we'll talk again tomorrow.

25:31.143 --> 25:33.509
It's the right thing to do, hon.

25:35.180 --> 25:39.947
Look. Hey! Even Charlie here agrees.

25:42.154 --> 25:47.717
Yup, in fact, he is so happy to be invited,
he brought you a special hostess gift.

26:18.857 --> 26:21.325
You shouldn't be out here, girl.
It's dangerous!

26:21.393 --> 26:22.451
I know.

26:22.794 --> 26:25.092
My daughter would never forgive me
if I left you out here alone.

26:25.163 --> 26:26.425
Where you trying to get to?

26:26.498 --> 26:29.092
As far away as you're willing to take me.

26:29.601 --> 26:31.569
All right, then. Climb on up here.

26:39.678 --> 26:42.909
Okay, he was dropped off in a car seat,
which means that

26:43.115 --> 26:46.915
whoever left him must
have a vehicle, right?

26:47.085 --> 26:51.522
It would also mean whoever left him
could be a million miles away by now.

26:51.590 --> 26:53.581
- Yeah.
- Here, take that.

26:56.228 --> 26:58.753
Should've packed a Hazmat suit.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.529
Wow, is that, like, normal?

27:02.601 --> 27:04.000
I think so.

27:06.004 --> 27:07.562
Okay, here we go.

27:07.673 --> 27:11.131
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna let you
take care of business here,

27:11.209 --> 27:14.337
and I'll go see if I can find
something to fill the bottle.

27:14.446 --> 27:17.779
Don't worry, champ, she'll get used to it.

27:39.204 --> 27:41.331
- Here you go.
- You want to give it to him?

27:41.673 --> 27:43.072
No.

27:43.642 --> 27:45.041
You sure?

27:47.279 --> 27:49.509
Yup, I'm sure.

28:02.427 --> 28:03.724
You okay?

28:10.068 --> 28:11.933
Want to talk about it?

28:17.709 --> 28:20.701
I can't stop thinking about
the baby's mother,

28:23.248 --> 28:26.081
about what she might be feeling right now.

28:35.394 --> 28:39.524
You know, it didn't matter
that I was full of anti-depressants

28:39.598 --> 28:41.623
when I gave my baby away.

28:43.802 --> 28:47.499
I still carry that pain in my heart.

28:48.340 --> 28:52.037
I think when most people see a baby,
they feel joy.

28:52.110 --> 28:55.102
All I feel is shame.

28:57.749 --> 29:02.413
I thought enough time had passed.
I'm so sorry.

29:02.487 --> 29:06.446
I'm such an idiot
to insist that we take the baby.

29:06.525 --> 29:09.221
- I'm gonna call the Sheriff.
- No. Don't.

29:10.829 --> 29:13.161
Maybe if I could find the mother...

29:13.265 --> 29:16.325
Finding the mother is the Sheriff's job.

29:16.601 --> 29:19.001
It's his job to arrest her, King.

29:20.705 --> 29:24.471
But if I make it my job to help her,

29:24.543 --> 29:29.708
then maybe, somehow,

29:29.781 --> 29:34.275
at the same time, I can help myself.

29:37.355 --> 29:38.754
Come here.

29:56.341 --> 29:57.433
Miss?

29:59.945 --> 30:01.003
Where are we?

30:01.079 --> 30:03.639
About 60 miles up the coast from
where you started.

30:03.715 --> 30:05.114
It's as far as I'm going.

30:05.450 --> 30:08.010
They got a woman's shelter here.

30:08.086 --> 30:11.544
Maybe fix you up with a shower
and some dry clothes.

30:19.431 --> 30:21.331
I won't forget your kindness.

30:21.399 --> 30:22.991
Take care, miss.

30:34.446 --> 30:35.845
Hey, there!

30:36.081 --> 30:38.345
I heard there was a shelter?

30:39.684 --> 30:41.117
No...

30:49.761 --> 30:51.422
King.

30:52.497 --> 30:53.987
Come on, King.

31:00.539 --> 31:04.635
She couldn't drop off
a kid with a volume control? Geez.

31:09.080 --> 31:13.744
Okay. Nothing personal, pal.

31:21.426 --> 31:25.123
And that's just how I'm gonna keep it,
right, cowboy?

31:27.666 --> 31:28.997
Woman on the floor!

31:29.935 --> 31:33.462
Pretty good stuff, huh?
I thought you might like that.

31:33.805 --> 31:36.899
Well, aren't we the picture of domesticity?

31:36.975 --> 31:38.033
What's all this?

31:38.109 --> 31:41.272
My neighbor had seven children
before she got her tubes tied.

31:41.513 --> 31:43.708
Last one is finally out of diapers.

31:43.782 --> 31:44.840
So long as we don't return it,

31:44.916 --> 31:47.817
she is more than happy to give us
all the baby junk we could use.

31:47.886 --> 31:50.787
Although you seem to be doing all right
without it.

31:51.323 --> 31:53.188
Who knew you'd be such a natural anyway?

31:53.258 --> 31:54.589
Me.

31:55.894 --> 31:58.556
- Nothing. Coffee?
- Sure.

31:58.630 --> 32:00.860
You started to say something?

32:00.966 --> 32:05.062
It's the reason I was so reluctant
to take Charlie in last night.

32:07.038 --> 32:09.302
You want to decipher that?

32:09.374 --> 32:12.366
You remember when Gil died,
how messed up I was?

32:12.444 --> 32:16.005
Yeah. Married only a couple of years.

32:16.081 --> 32:17.548
Pregnant.

32:17.616 --> 32:20.517
Future wiped out by a stupid car crash.

32:21.920 --> 32:23.945
I might've considered suicide, too.

32:24.022 --> 32:26.855
I did more than consider it, Dot.

32:27.359 --> 32:28.553
I know.

32:28.627 --> 32:33.223
And when Christine was born,
I was in no condition to care for her.

32:33.331 --> 32:37.062
No, you weren't.
But it turned out all right, though.

32:37.135 --> 32:39.330
Her adoptive parents did one heck of a job.

32:39.404 --> 32:40.462
Yeah, they did.

32:41.906 --> 32:45.637
And, thanks to a miracle,
she's back in my life now.

32:45.710 --> 32:47.075
But?

32:47.178 --> 32:48.236
But

32:49.881 --> 32:52.406
I didn't get to be her mother.

32:52.484 --> 32:54.384
I mean, not like this.

32:54.719 --> 32:57.051
Not when she needed me the most.

32:59.057 --> 33:02.390
I can't tell you how deeply I regret that.

33:05.363 --> 33:08.298
And that's why I have
to find this child's mom,

33:08.366 --> 33:11.164
so she doesn't end up like me.

33:11.236 --> 33:13.796
And before you fall in love with that baby.

33:14.039 --> 33:15.301
No, no, no.

33:15.373 --> 33:19.503
Not gonna let that one happen,
no matter how adorable you are!

33:20.979 --> 33:23.413
Charlie's just on a banana high right now.

33:23.481 --> 33:26.746
Trust me, when he comes down,
he's gonna want his real mom.

33:27.719 --> 33:31.450
Hey, how much confidence
do you have in your Sheriff?

33:31.523 --> 33:33.991
I don't expect the folks at CSI

33:34.059 --> 33:36.789
to set their next spin-off
here in Constant Harbor.

33:37.896 --> 33:39.864
Do you think that he would have
looked around for local girls

33:39.931 --> 33:41.626
who might be in trouble?

33:41.700 --> 33:42.758
I doubt it.

33:42.834 --> 33:46.497
He's got his plate pretty full with
this weekend's Crab Festival.

33:46.571 --> 33:47.731
I can lend you my car,

33:47.806 --> 33:50.832
if you want to go and talk to
Pastor Newton at the Baptist church.

33:50.909 --> 33:53.002
He's who Carl would have asked.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.514
Maybe I'll do that.

34:01.052 --> 34:04.249
How desolate would you have to be,
dear reader,

34:04.322 --> 34:08.656
to leave a child you bore
with a total stranger?

34:09.393 --> 34:14.024
And if you were that stranger,
having found an infant on your doorstep,

34:14.099 --> 34:17.226
what are your obligations
to care for the child?

34:17.302 --> 34:19.429
To find the baby's parents?

34:19.504 --> 34:23.167
To understand what motivated
such desperation?

34:23.241 --> 34:29.202
To help mitigate the problems that led to
an act as misguided as child abandonment?

34:29.447 --> 34:32.848
These and many more questions
are on my mind of late,

34:32.917 --> 34:35.818
and they are not entirely hypothetical,

34:35.887 --> 34:41.291
as last night, I discovered a baby,
left, like Moses,

34:41.359 --> 34:43.452
on the steps of my cottage.

34:44.496 --> 34:47.293
Yeah, bub, I'm talking about you.

34:47.364 --> 34:48.525
Looks good on you.

34:49.501 --> 34:51.059
Drool?

34:51.136 --> 34:52.797
Motherhood.

34:54.572 --> 34:58.804
Yeah, Charlie here is
a guest star in our reality show,

34:58.877 --> 35:02.278
he's not a regular,
and don't you let me forget that, okay?

35:02.480 --> 35:06.314
Doesn't mean we can't enjoy the little guy
while he's here, though, right?

35:06.384 --> 35:07.942
I heard Dot earlier.

35:08.019 --> 35:13.286
Did she have any news
on who Charlie belongs to?

35:14.592 --> 35:18.892
I think that finding the baby's mother is
on the Sheriff's back burner.

35:18.963 --> 35:21.932
I still can't help wondering, "Why us?"

35:22.467 --> 35:24.264
Yeah. Me, too.

35:26.571 --> 35:28.732
You know, maybe it was a fan thing.

35:28.807 --> 35:30.001
Come on.

35:30.074 --> 35:31.371
No, really.

35:31.443 --> 35:32.740
I mean, maybe somebody read your book

35:32.811 --> 35:35.473
and thought you were
the kind of person that would,

35:36.815 --> 35:38.214
you know...

35:40.752 --> 35:42.049
Peyton?

35:46.257 --> 35:51.217
Can you watch our boy for a while?
I have a couple errands I want to run.

35:51.763 --> 35:52.821
Sure.

36:06.044 --> 36:10.003
Well, sleeping beauty awakens.

36:10.114 --> 36:11.308
Where am I?

36:11.382 --> 36:12.713
At our humble clinic.

36:12.784 --> 36:16.345
You passed out.
Seems you've got pneumonia.

36:16.421 --> 36:19.151
I don't have insurance. I can't pay.

36:19.424 --> 36:22.587
Don't worry about it.
We'll figure something out.

36:24.596 --> 36:28.464
I'm Tilly Minor. And you are?

36:29.434 --> 36:30.560
Ramona.

36:32.270 --> 36:34.067
Ramona Eastmore.

36:37.408 --> 36:38.875
Okay, Ramona.

36:40.011 --> 36:41.376
Rest up.

36:41.446 --> 36:42.913
I'll be back in a while,

36:42.981 --> 36:47.850
and if you feel up to it, you can tell me
what brought you to our shelter.

36:51.422 --> 36:53.890
This fell out of your jacket.

36:53.958 --> 36:57.826
I thought he might be important to you,
so I cleaned him up a bit.

37:05.270 --> 37:07.864
Five foot two, maybe.

37:08.339 --> 37:09.704
Dark hair.

37:10.775 --> 37:13.642
Pretty, but sallow. Tired eyes.

37:13.711 --> 37:16.111
And she told me her name was Violet.

37:17.649 --> 37:20.413
No bells are ringing. Sorry.

37:22.053 --> 37:24.180
And you're sure that no local girls...

37:24.255 --> 37:27.315
Constant Harbor's a small community,
Ms. MacGruder.

37:27.392 --> 37:31.795
I know all the babies in the area.
I baptized half of them.

37:32.864 --> 37:36.322
None are at risk, at
least not at the moment.

37:37.402 --> 37:41.338
Our sister church over in Ruckston
runs a woman's shelter.

37:41.973 --> 37:45.306
It's a long shot,
but you might give them a call.

37:49.013 --> 37:50.344
Thank you.

38:17.308 --> 38:20.209
Ruckston Women's Shelter. Hello?

38:23.047 --> 38:24.173
Hello?

38:33.324 --> 38:35.792
Well, what do you think?

38:37.762 --> 38:39.855
I think he's gonna love it.

38:42.667 --> 38:43.861
What?

38:43.935 --> 38:45.960
I'm surprised, is all,

38:47.205 --> 38:51.039
at how into the whole fatherhood thing
you seem to be.

38:51.409 --> 38:56.574
Yeah. I wasn't around that much
when David was Charlie's age,

38:56.648 --> 38:58.946
or any age, for that matter.

38:59.017 --> 39:02.544
As you know, I mean, that's the main reason
his mom and I got divorced,

39:03.054 --> 39:07.650
and the reason that he and I have had
such a rough time communicating.

39:08.393 --> 39:10.156
I guess having Charlie around has

39:11.095 --> 39:15.395
made me regret some decisions
I've made along the way as well.

39:18.302 --> 39:20.736
After what I did,

39:23.141 --> 39:25.974
do you think I deserve another chance?

39:29.647 --> 39:34.050
It's well known
that God is very generous with chances.

39:37.221 --> 39:39.348
Is that something you'd consider?

39:39.857 --> 39:41.984
What, you mean, adopting a baby?

39:42.894 --> 39:46.557
Or keeping Charlie,
if his mother never shows up.

39:51.436 --> 39:53.768
I didn't realize that you...

39:53.938 --> 39:57.704
Look, I'm thinking about the AARP,
not the PTA.

39:58.042 --> 40:02.775
At this stage of the game, we're supposed
to be thinking about that, not this.

40:04.482 --> 40:08.418
Who says what we're supposed to
be doing with our lives if not us?

40:09.253 --> 40:10.686
I don't know, it just seems like

40:11.122 --> 40:13.989
it's a sign, you know,
that maybe we should...

40:14.058 --> 40:15.958
What? Start all over?

40:16.994 --> 40:18.621
Maybe, yeah.

40:18.696 --> 40:21.790
With diapers, pre-school, play-dates?

40:22.433 --> 40:23.661
Why not?

40:29.407 --> 40:33.207
I just never thought
I'd be having this conversation with you.

40:34.979 --> 40:36.913
But now that you are?

40:43.354 --> 40:45.379
I'm gonna get some air.

41:03.808 --> 41:06.777
- Great day for sailing.
- Can say that again.

41:49.687 --> 41:50.949
Can I help you?

41:53.124 --> 41:55.991
This truck looks like
it might belong to a friend of mine.

41:56.060 --> 41:59.359
A pretty young woman. Is it in for repairs?

41:59.430 --> 42:03.992
Nope. This one's an impound.
Illegally parked on the edge of town.

42:04.068 --> 42:06.593
Besides repairs, we do towing for the city.

42:06.804 --> 42:08.066
She's just out of gas, though,

42:08.139 --> 42:10.835
so I expect someone will
come looking for her sooner or later.

42:11.375 --> 42:12.865
Sheriff know it's here?

42:12.944 --> 42:16.277
Yeah, one of his deputies called us to
come pick it up, so, yeah, I guess so.

42:16.347 --> 42:18.508
Who's it registered to?

42:18.583 --> 42:20.073
I didn't look.

42:20.885 --> 42:23.116
You mind if I do? 'Cause
if it's my friend's,

42:23.117 --> 42:25.254
I can just give her a call,
tell her it's here.

42:25.656 --> 42:27.021
Yeah, help yourself.

42:27.091 --> 42:28.615
Hey, Steve! Phone's for you!

42:28.693 --> 42:30.285
- Excuse me.
- Line one.

42:39.904 --> 42:41.667
"Violet Johnson."

42:52.316 --> 42:55.183
I'm not sure you should be
looking through that stuff.

42:56.087 --> 42:58.351
You're right, sorry.

42:58.422 --> 43:00.686
The truck belong to your friend?

43:00.758 --> 43:04.023
No. Afraid not, but thanks
for letting me look.

43:05.463 --> 43:06.930
Yeah, sure.

43:10.167 --> 43:11.794
I was starting to get worried.

43:13.004 --> 43:14.528
I can tell.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.398
Where's Charlie?

43:17.475 --> 43:22.811
Woke up after you left. Sucked down
another bottle and went back to dreamland.

43:22.880 --> 43:26.043
I found a baby monitor in the stuff
Dot brought,

43:26.117 --> 43:29.814
so we should be covered till he wakes up.

43:29.887 --> 43:32.412
Probably gonna stay up all night.

43:33.424 --> 43:34.789
Probably.

43:39.530 --> 43:41.361
Look, Peyton.

43:41.832 --> 43:43.322
I'm sorry.

43:44.135 --> 43:48.902
You know better than anybody, sensitivity's
never really been my strong suit.

43:50.141 --> 43:55.579
But have you asked yourself
why you think we should keep this baby?

43:55.646 --> 43:59.605
I mean, if the opportunity presents itself?

44:00.618 --> 44:02.347
Of course I have.

44:04.622 --> 44:06.852
Look, my heart is breaking
for Charlie's mother,

44:06.924 --> 44:10.291
but at the same time, I'm trying to

44:11.429 --> 44:17.459
untangle how Charlie's breath on my face
makes me feel.

44:19.437 --> 44:23.669
And, you know, it seems like
you're falling in love with him, too,

44:23.741 --> 44:27.233
but you won't even talk about
starting a family.

44:27.311 --> 44:31.042
Starting a family again.

44:31.115 --> 44:33.811
Again, but this time,

44:35.353 --> 44:38.151
the two of us, together.

44:46.197 --> 44:48.097
Okay, nice work, everybody.

44:48.165 --> 44:51.293
Just please make sure
that all the participants

44:51.402 --> 44:53.529
fill in the liability form, okay?

44:53.604 --> 44:55.595
This one here.

44:55.673 --> 44:57.106
Looks like you've got your hands full.

44:57.174 --> 44:59.768
Yeah, and it's not just the parade.

44:59.844 --> 45:02.074
I'm in charge of picking
this year's Crab Queen.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.375
Can I nominate my boss?

45:04.448 --> 45:05.881
Well, I don't know, is she under 16?

45:05.950 --> 45:07.747
Not for many years.

45:08.619 --> 45:11.179
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Sure.

45:12.323 --> 45:13.813
- So?
- So?

45:13.891 --> 45:15.290
You come to volunteer?

45:15.359 --> 45:18.487
No, I came to pick your brain.

45:18.562 --> 45:21.554
Well, a meager harvest, but help yourself.

45:23.534 --> 45:28.164
What will happen if they find the mother,
from a legal standpoint?

45:28.239 --> 45:30.537
Well, it could go several ways.

45:31.375 --> 45:32.842
Depending on?

45:32.910 --> 45:37.540
Depending on why the mother
abandoned the child in the first place,

45:37.615 --> 45:39.583
her mental and physical state,

45:39.650 --> 45:42.210
a whole host of possibly
mitigating circumstances.

45:42.286 --> 45:43.378
I mean, once she's picked up,

45:43.454 --> 45:46.014
she'll be questioned first
by law enforcement,

45:46.090 --> 45:48.490
and then a family court judge
will try to determine

45:48.559 --> 45:51.050
the best possible option for Charlie.

45:53.230 --> 45:57.826
Including returning him to the woman
who left him on my doorstep?

45:57.902 --> 46:01.633
As a rule,
the court tries to keep a family intact.

46:01.705 --> 46:03.935
I mean, completely severing
the biological bond

46:04.008 --> 46:07.876
between a mother and her baby
is rarely the best outcome.

46:07.945 --> 46:10.072
And if they never find the mother?

46:10.147 --> 46:13.480
Then Family Services will take the child,

46:13.551 --> 46:18.420
and he'll go into foster care
and then into the adoption pool.

46:18.489 --> 46:20.116
How long does that take?

46:21.258 --> 46:24.819
Before you can adopt Charlie?
Is that what you're asking?

46:27.198 --> 46:28.187
Really?

46:30.367 --> 46:32.494
Several months at best.

46:32.570 --> 46:36.267
I mean, bureaucracy is dense when it
comes to kids, but if you're patient...

46:36.340 --> 46:37.671
It could happen?

46:38.742 --> 46:40.107
Is King on board with this?

46:40.878 --> 46:44.006
I don't even know if I'm on board with it.

46:44.081 --> 46:47.380
Look, I empathize with the mother,
for obvious reasons,

46:47.451 --> 46:49.316
- but I also want to protect Charlie.
- Peyton.

46:49.386 --> 46:53.755
Peyton, you do not have to adopt Charlie
to protect him.

46:53.824 --> 46:56.292
As for Charlie's mother, well,

46:56.360 --> 46:59.818
you can't really help her,
unless you know where she is.

47:05.836 --> 47:10.432
Well, look at you.
What a difference a little rest makes.

47:11.242 --> 47:14.302
The doctor says I'll be good to go
in another day or so.

47:16.046 --> 47:17.604
And then what?

47:18.582 --> 47:20.277
I'm not sure yet.

47:20.851 --> 47:24.912
And I hate to ask this,
after everything you've already done,

47:25.789 --> 47:29.088
but you don't know of any work
around here, do you?

47:30.027 --> 47:34.157
I can handle almost anything
from waiting tables to pumping gas.

47:34.231 --> 47:36.358
I might be able to scare something up.

47:37.568 --> 47:41.299
Let's get you healthy first,
and then we'll worry about a job.

47:47.311 --> 47:48.335
Ramona?

47:48.412 --> 47:52.906
Have you heard of a woman about your age

47:53.684 --> 47:55.515
named Violet?

47:58.022 --> 48:00.252
Never. Why?

48:00.357 --> 48:03.758
I just got a call from a pastor
in Constant Harbor.

48:04.862 --> 48:07.228
The description sounded like you.

48:08.032 --> 48:09.397
Really?

48:10.100 --> 48:13.092
I've been running the
shelter for a long time,

48:13.170 --> 48:15.070
heard a lot of stories.

48:15.739 --> 48:17.969
The ones with the happy endings,

48:18.042 --> 48:24.311
the heroines figure out
that help and trust go hand in hand.

48:39.029 --> 48:41.054
We'll just give it a test.

48:43.033 --> 48:44.295
- Hey!
- Hey.

48:44.368 --> 48:46.768
A regular eating machine, isn't he?

48:46.837 --> 48:49.704
Yeah, we might have to invest in a cow.

48:51.075 --> 48:53.100
- There you go.
- For some, it's eat, pray, love,

48:53.177 --> 48:56.613
and for Charlie it's
eat, poop, sleep, right?

48:57.948 --> 48:59.609
I think somebody needs a diaper change.

48:59.683 --> 49:03.210
- Yeah? Okay, here.
- No, no. No, I can do it. I can do it.

49:03.988 --> 49:05.615
Come on, sweetie.

49:06.223 --> 49:07.622
Let's go. Let's go.

49:07.691 --> 49:10.888
King? I just talked to Dot,

49:11.829 --> 49:16.528
and she said that
if the mother never showed up,

49:16.600 --> 49:20.502
that we would have a chance,
you know, if we want to adopt Charlie.

49:22.740 --> 49:25.573
You know, I didn't realize until now that

49:25.643 --> 49:28.305
if I hadn't given up my own baby,

49:28.379 --> 49:32.941
she was the thing
that would have healed my despair,

49:34.518 --> 49:39.182
and Charlie's being here
has just reawakened a longing in me.

49:40.391 --> 49:44.851
I need to be a mother, King,
in every sense of the word.

49:47.231 --> 49:51.395
And I can either join you
in your journey, or...

49:53.003 --> 49:54.470
Or what?

49:59.376 --> 50:01.503
Hello. My name is Tilly Minor,

50:01.578 --> 50:04.706
and I'm calling from the women's shelter
over in Ruckston.

50:04.782 --> 50:06.682
Pastor Newton gave me your number.

50:06.750 --> 50:08.047
This is Peyton MacGruder.

50:08.118 --> 50:11.747
Hi. I was just leaving a message.

50:11.822 --> 50:14.120
Yeah, I know, sorry.
I couldn't get to the phone.

50:15.693 --> 50:18.560
Well, as I was saying,
Pastor Newton gave me your number.

50:18.629 --> 50:23.532
I'm calling about the girl
that you're looking for, Violet?

50:24.268 --> 50:26.259
Is she there at your shelter?

50:26.337 --> 50:28.032
Maybe.

50:28.105 --> 50:29.538
Maybe?

50:29.640 --> 50:31.733
There's a young woman here...

50:31.809 --> 50:34.243
Well, at our clinic, actually.

50:34.311 --> 50:37.439
She says her name is Ramona Eastmore,
but I don't...

50:37.514 --> 50:39.539
I think she's making that up.

50:39.616 --> 50:43.677
She fits the description
that you gave the pastor to a tee.

50:45.923 --> 50:49.950
He also told me about the baby
that you're caring for.

50:50.027 --> 50:51.119
How's he doing?

50:51.762 --> 50:52.922
Fine.

50:53.764 --> 50:56.392
You said that she's in your clinic?

50:56.467 --> 50:57.957
That's right.

50:58.035 --> 51:00.469
For drugs and alcohol,
like that kind of clinic?

51:00.537 --> 51:04.268
No. When she arrived
here, she was very ill.

51:04.341 --> 51:06.571
Collapsed in my arms, in fact.

51:06.643 --> 51:08.167
How is she now?

51:08.245 --> 51:09.678
Improved.

51:11.582 --> 51:15.916
Ms. MacGruder, this girl needs help.

51:15.986 --> 51:17.715
That's why she's come to us.

51:17.788 --> 51:22.191
Can I assume that you have
her best interests at heart?

51:23.360 --> 51:24.622
Yes.

51:25.162 --> 51:29.462
Then I can ask her to meet with you
if you'd like.

51:29.533 --> 51:32.627
I don't know if she will, but...

51:33.570 --> 51:35.094
Ms. MacGruder?

51:36.073 --> 51:39.133
Can I call you back, like, maybe tomorrow?

51:41.078 --> 51:45.515
Yeah. I guess. Sure.

51:45.582 --> 51:46.844
Thanks.

51:49.586 --> 51:51.281
Who's Pastor Newton?

51:53.056 --> 51:55.490
He's a local minister.

51:55.559 --> 51:58.221
I met with him about finding Charlie's mom.

51:58.295 --> 52:00.786
I thought you'd decided to leave that
to the Sheriff.

52:00.864 --> 52:03.594
I haven't decided anything.

52:03.667 --> 52:07.000
I'm just trying to sort out
what's best for Charlie.

52:17.781 --> 52:18.975
Dearest readers,

52:19.049 --> 52:22.382
having, I believe,
discovered the identity of Charlie's mom

52:22.453 --> 52:24.478
leaves me with a dilemma.

52:24.555 --> 52:29.458
Most mothers can't comprehend
the act of giving up their child.

52:29.526 --> 52:31.756
Yet having done so myself,

52:31.829 --> 52:36.061
I have deep empathy for the pain
this young woman must be suffering.

52:36.133 --> 52:40.399
At the same time,
I don't know if I can find the strength,

52:40.471 --> 52:45.932
for the second time in my life,
to give away a baby I've come to adore.

52:46.009 --> 52:49.069
When two women claimed to be
the mother of an infant,

52:49.146 --> 52:52.741
the Biblical King Solomon
called for a sword.

52:52.816 --> 52:57.310
"Divide the child in two, " he said,
"and give half to each. ."

52:57.387 --> 53:00.618
When the sword was raised,
the child's true mother said,

53:00.691 --> 53:04.422
"Give her the child, but
by no means slay it. ."

53:04.495 --> 53:09.023
In his wisdom, Solomon knew
the one who loved the child most

53:09.099 --> 53:12.500
would give it up rather than see it hurt.

53:12.569 --> 53:15.538
Can the child's birth mother be that woman?

53:16.440 --> 53:17.600
Can I?

53:34.791 --> 53:37.783
I am so glad you called
back, Ms. MacGruder.

53:37.861 --> 53:38.885
Peyton.

53:38.962 --> 53:40.554
As I said to you on the phone,

53:40.631 --> 53:44.123
I spoke with Ramona,
and she agreed to meet with you.

53:45.435 --> 53:47.869
Where's the woman who was in this room?

53:47.938 --> 53:50.805
Insisted on being discharged
early this morning.

54:15.098 --> 54:17.862
Good. You are so good.

54:46.029 --> 54:47.053
Okay, boys, listen up.

54:47.130 --> 54:48.995
One of you run down to the park for me,
will you?

54:49.066 --> 54:53.799
And make sure the American Legion float is
ready to roll after the last marching band.

54:53.870 --> 54:56.236
Okay? Got it?
All right, away you go, quick as you can.

54:56.306 --> 54:57.864
Thank you!

54:57.941 --> 55:00.375
- Hey, Dot!
- Hey, boys!

55:01.311 --> 55:02.778
Hey, Charlie.

55:02.846 --> 55:04.575
You taking good care of King?

55:04.982 --> 55:08.145
I'm easy.
I'm a sucker for balloons and bands.

55:08.218 --> 55:09.685
So where's your beautiful
wife this morning?

55:09.753 --> 55:11.846
- I thought you might know.
- What do you mean?

55:11.955 --> 55:13.217
She was gone when we got up.

55:13.290 --> 55:15.986
I found a note saying
she had something she had to do.

55:16.660 --> 55:19.424
- Well, that's definitive.
- Yeah.

55:30.540 --> 55:33.873
I think she might have a lead
on Charlie's mother.

55:33.944 --> 55:35.172
What makes you say that?

55:35.712 --> 55:39.705
She got a phone call last night,
something about a minister?

55:41.418 --> 55:43.784
- Pastor Newton?
- Yeah. Newton.

55:44.621 --> 55:46.384
Well, that's interesting.

55:52.663 --> 55:54.062
Interesting.

55:55.632 --> 55:57.623
This little guy's got her tied in knots.

55:57.701 --> 56:01.797
She wants to help the mother,
but she also wants to keep Charlie.

56:01.872 --> 56:05.968
I know. I talked to Peyton yesterday
about adopting him.

56:06.043 --> 56:10.070
Yes, and you told her it would be possible,
which puts me in a very difficult...

56:10.147 --> 56:12.342
King! King, behind you!

56:13.717 --> 56:14.877
Hey!

56:18.021 --> 56:19.818
Peyton! Wait!

56:19.890 --> 56:21.357
Meet me at the cottage!

56:32.736 --> 56:34.363
Violet, wait!

56:34.438 --> 56:38.772
Please. Don't freak out. Don't...
I want to help you.

56:38.842 --> 56:41.538
No, you don't. I heard them talking,

56:41.611 --> 56:44.341
your husband and that woman,
about adopting Charlie, and you can't!

56:44.414 --> 56:46.075
You can't take my baby!

56:46.149 --> 56:47.275
- Listen to me...
- Let me go!

56:47.350 --> 56:50.877
No, listen to me! I don't know
why you left your baby with me,

56:50.954 --> 56:55.084
but if anyone understands
what you're going through, it's me.

56:55.158 --> 56:59.026
And it doesn't matter what you overheard,
you've got to trust me.

56:59.096 --> 57:02.088
I mean, at least enough to explain to me

57:02.165 --> 57:06.124
what you were thinking
when you left Charlie on my doorstep.

57:07.604 --> 57:09.128
Violet, look,

57:09.940 --> 57:15.105
either you can explain it to me,
or you can explain it to the Sheriff.

57:16.246 --> 57:18.180
It's your choice.

57:22.519 --> 57:25.818
Now, why don't you start at the beginning?

57:27.724 --> 57:29.487
Here you go, Violet.

57:32.362 --> 57:34.523
Why did you leave your baby?

57:35.699 --> 57:38.668
Because I wasn't thinking straight,
and 'cause I thought you'd help us.

57:39.636 --> 57:42.036
I'd like to help you,

57:42.105 --> 57:44.369
but I also want to do
what's best for Charlie.

57:44.441 --> 57:47.103
Except you think what's best for him
is for you to be his mom.

57:47.177 --> 57:51.511
But I love him more than life itself,
and nothing you do or say will change that!

57:51.581 --> 57:53.481
Then why did you leave him?

57:53.550 --> 57:55.347
I left him because I love him.

57:57.487 --> 58:01.321
Peyton! Dot's on her way, and...

58:09.299 --> 58:10.459
Yeah.

58:20.210 --> 58:21.234
Look...

58:21.645 --> 58:23.272
I was sick, okay?

58:24.147 --> 58:26.479
Out of my head with fever.
Out of work, out of money.

58:26.550 --> 58:27.539
Why us?

58:27.617 --> 58:29.744
Well, I heard you on the radio,

58:29.820 --> 58:33.221
and I went down to the bookstore
thinking that you could help me,

58:33.290 --> 58:37.158
you know, give me some advice.
Help me figure out what to do.

58:37.227 --> 58:40.162
And then you came in, and...

58:40.697 --> 58:42.927
And I just left you standing there.

58:42.999 --> 58:45.729
But it was stupid of me to think
that you could help us.

58:45.802 --> 58:48.168
I mean, why would you?
You don't even know me.

58:48.238 --> 58:50.536
How did Charlie end up on our porch?

58:51.975 --> 58:54.705
I saw you in town later.
I followed you here.

58:54.778 --> 58:58.680
What about family?
Couldn't you have called somebody?

58:58.748 --> 59:02.707
I don't have family,
at least that I can count on.

59:02.786 --> 59:04.549
The baby's father, what about him?

59:04.621 --> 59:07.818
- He's gone.
- Gone?

59:07.891 --> 59:09.256
Dead.

59:09.326 --> 59:12.261
Let me guess, the prodigal mother.

59:12.329 --> 59:14.923
Dot, this is Violet Johnson.

59:14.998 --> 59:19.594
Violet, this is my friend, Dot Grey.
She owns the bookshop where we met.

59:20.837 --> 59:23.169
She's also an attorney.

59:24.074 --> 59:26.508
Okay, wait, I don't need a lawyer.

59:27.577 --> 59:29.943
I just want Charlie back
so we can get on with our lives.

59:30.013 --> 59:32.277
Violet, it's not that simple.

59:32.349 --> 59:34.840
Why not? I made a mistake,

59:34.918 --> 59:37.318
- thinking I was doing the right thing...
- You abandoned your child.

59:37.387 --> 59:40.254
- No, I did not! Not really.
- Yes, you did,

59:40.323 --> 59:42.723
in the eyes of the law, anyway.

59:44.160 --> 59:47.027
But we don't have to tell anybody, do we?

59:47.097 --> 59:50.032
I mean, there's got to be some way
I can prove to you...

59:50.100 --> 59:54.867
I'm sorry, Violet, but you're gonna
have to prove it to a judge.

59:54.938 --> 59:58.135
As an officer of the court,
I had to call the Sheriff.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.675
What?

01:00:03.146 --> 01:00:04.579
This her?

01:00:04.648 --> 01:00:06.616
Okay, this is a mistake.

01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:09.914
- I only meant to leave him for a few days.
- Come on.

01:00:09.986 --> 01:00:11.647
- No. Please don't take him.
- Come on. Let him go.

01:00:11.721 --> 01:00:14.349
There we go. There you go, baby.

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:19.286
It's okay. It's all right.

01:00:19.362 --> 01:00:21.592
So what's your name, miss?

01:00:21.665 --> 01:00:23.963
It's Violet, Violet Johnson.

01:00:24.034 --> 01:00:28.562
Miss Johnson, I'm gonna have to ask you
to put your hands behind your back.

01:00:28.638 --> 01:00:31.937
I'm gonna take you outside
and a female deputy is gonna search you.

01:00:32.008 --> 01:00:33.839
Then I'll read your Miranda rights

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:36.470
and then I'm gonna
transport you off to jail.

01:00:36.546 --> 01:00:38.844
Goodbye, Charlie. I'm so sorry.

01:00:41.284 --> 01:00:44.276
I'll follow along and see
what more I can find out.

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:48.318
- Yeah.
- Mama.

01:00:48.391 --> 01:00:49.517
It's okay.

01:00:50.126 --> 01:00:51.559
No.

01:00:54.998 --> 01:00:57.296
- How is she?
- Well, she's pretty shaken up.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:01:00.336
Agreed to let me sit in
on the initial interview with the Sheriff,

01:01:00.403 --> 01:01:04.362
to make sure she didn't say anything
that could hurt her case.

01:01:04.441 --> 01:01:05.772
So what's her story?

01:01:05.842 --> 01:01:10.541
Well, she was sick,
verified by Tilly Minor in Ruckston.

01:01:10.613 --> 01:01:14.674
She lost her job as a waitress,
no place to live, no savings,

01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:19.654
couldn't find work without child care,
couldn't afford child care till she got a job.

01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:24.285
- Catch-22.
- Yeah. Not uncommon in this economy.

01:01:24.361 --> 01:01:27.194
Yeah, but no less difficult,
especially when you're a kid.

01:01:27.263 --> 01:01:28.287
What is she, 20?

01:01:28.365 --> 01:01:29.457
Nineteen.

01:01:30.333 --> 01:01:32.164
- Family?
- Mother.

01:01:32.235 --> 01:01:34.863
Lives inland a bit, a
place called Green Lake.

01:01:34.938 --> 01:01:39.602
On Prospect Point Road. Violet's
truck is registered to that address.

01:01:39.709 --> 01:01:41.199
Her truck?

01:01:42.178 --> 01:01:44.146
The Sheriff had it towed.

01:01:44.214 --> 01:01:46.182
Never put two and two together.

01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:49.946
Well, I won't tell him
that you add better than he does.

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:54.249
Is there any chance that she'll see me?

01:01:54.324 --> 01:01:59.057
I doubt that.
Violet is convinced that you want Charlie.

01:01:59.963 --> 01:02:01.430
Is she wrong?

01:02:04.467 --> 01:02:05.559
I...

01:02:06.536 --> 01:02:10.632
I want what's best for everyone,
especially Charlie.

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:13.540
So what about bail?

01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.376
I'm on my way to see the judge right now,
and already late.

01:02:18.448 --> 01:02:23.351
I get her out, she can stay with me,
but she's gonna want to see the baby.

01:02:24.154 --> 01:02:28.284
Unlikely a judge is gonna
allow it, unless...

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:29.918
What?

01:02:29.993 --> 01:02:33.087
You're willing to supervise the visits.

01:02:35.365 --> 01:02:36.389
What do you say?

01:02:36.466 --> 01:02:39.902
It might give you a chance
to get to know the girl a little bit more,

01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:41.596
see what she's about.

01:02:42.105 --> 01:02:46.667
Okay. If the judge is willing, so am I.

01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.504
Okay.

01:02:49.145 --> 01:02:51.477
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Bye.

01:02:55.385 --> 01:02:57.319
What were you thinking?

01:02:57.387 --> 01:03:02.188
If you didn't tell anyone where the girl
was, that we could just hang on to Charlie?

01:03:02.258 --> 01:03:04.818
- I mean, criminy, Peyton.
- You're right.

01:03:04.894 --> 01:03:07.055
I do want another child.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:10.691
And the fact that you're not interested
is something that,

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:12.394
someday, we're gonna have to deal with,

01:03:12.469 --> 01:03:15.165
but no matter what, I'm not gonna
just give the baby back to her

01:03:15.238 --> 01:03:19.436
until I know everything there is to know
about Violet Johnson.

01:03:19.509 --> 01:03:22.205
I care about that little boy,

01:03:22.278 --> 01:03:23.939
more than I ever thought was possible,

01:03:24.013 --> 01:03:27.278
and nothing is gonna stop me
from keeping him safe!

01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:33.788
I want to thank you, for, you know,
making this happen.

01:03:33.857 --> 01:03:35.620
Thank Dot, not me.

01:03:36.626 --> 01:03:38.685
Well, she told me
that you had to agree to the visits,

01:03:38.761 --> 01:03:42.959
and, you know,
I appreciate that you were willing.

01:03:45.768 --> 01:03:47.531
I nearly forgot.

01:03:53.076 --> 01:03:55.738
Hey, come here, baby.

01:04:02.218 --> 01:04:04.209
Thought you might need these.

01:04:04.287 --> 01:04:05.948
Where did you...

01:04:06.022 --> 01:04:09.788
Your truck is parked
behind the auto parts store,

01:04:09.859 --> 01:04:12.293
and the Sheriff said it would be okay
if I picked up your stuff.

01:04:13.496 --> 01:04:15.054
Appreciate that.

01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:17.565
I couldn't help but notice...

01:04:19.169 --> 01:04:20.397
Your husband?

01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:23.029
We never got married.

01:04:24.307 --> 01:04:29.802
We were engaged.
Had a date set and all, even rented a hall.

01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:36.816
You know, I was married,
before King, I mean,

01:04:36.886 --> 01:04:39.582
when I wasn't that much older than you.

01:04:40.657 --> 01:04:43.217
He died in a car accident.

01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:44.555
Sorry.

01:04:46.362 --> 01:04:49.331
And I was pregnant at the time.

01:04:49.399 --> 01:04:50.730
Really?

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.928
And then, after the baby was born,

01:04:54.003 --> 01:04:58.963
I was too messed up to care for her,
for a lot of reasons.

01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:01.135
I gave her away.

01:05:03.646 --> 01:05:07.605
You know, I didn't want to keep Charlie
the night that you left him with us,

01:05:07.684 --> 01:05:10.517
because I was afraid of what,
in fact, happened.

01:05:11.454 --> 01:05:13.422
I fell in love with him.

01:05:15.758 --> 01:05:17.623
Would I take Charlie?

01:05:18.094 --> 01:05:19.288
Gladly.

01:05:21.164 --> 01:05:23.724
But would I take him away from you? Never.

01:05:26.302 --> 01:05:28.634
As long as you can convince me

01:05:28.705 --> 01:05:31.799
that you can give him
the care that he deserves.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:38.278
How can I do that?
After everything that's happened?

01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:44.582
You can start by telling me about...

01:05:45.722 --> 01:05:49.055
Zach. Zach Weston.

01:05:50.426 --> 01:05:52.519
How'd you meet?

01:05:52.595 --> 01:05:54.153
High school.

01:05:54.831 --> 01:06:01.031
He was like this big, funny, brainiac jock
that everybody liked,

01:06:02.338 --> 01:06:06.968
and I was this bed-head hair,
dyed black to match my fingernails,

01:06:07.043 --> 01:06:10.274
outsider geek that nobody
paid attention to.

01:06:10.346 --> 01:06:12.314
Except, apparently, Zach.

01:06:12.382 --> 01:06:17.410
Go to college, get jobs, get married,
that was the plan.

01:06:17.487 --> 01:06:20.320
Till I got pregnant,
and everything turned upside down.

01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:22.221
How old were you?

01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:24.783
Seventeen. Zach had just turned 18.

01:06:26.162 --> 01:06:27.993
Old enough to know better.

01:06:28.064 --> 01:06:30.362
How did your family react?

01:06:30.433 --> 01:06:34.199
There's no dad in my family album.
My mom called me a...

01:06:36.406 --> 01:06:40.069
Let's just say she wasn't supportive
and leave it at that.

01:06:41.411 --> 01:06:43.436
And what about Zach's family?

01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:46.414
Zach's mother's dead, and his father...

01:06:49.886 --> 01:06:53.049
Zach joined the service
so we'd have insurance for the baby.

01:06:53.122 --> 01:06:57.422
Everything would've been fine
except he got killed.

01:06:57.493 --> 01:07:00.189
"A training accident, " they said.

01:07:01.664 --> 01:07:04.394
After that,
I thought I could make it on my own.

01:07:04.467 --> 01:07:08.164
And I did, until I got sick.

01:07:09.906 --> 01:07:12.670
Anyway, I'm better now,

01:07:12.742 --> 01:07:18.146
and I can take care of my baby just fine,
and I'll find work somehow.

01:07:18.214 --> 01:07:19.738
We'll be fine.

01:07:21.918 --> 01:07:26.184
And I'm begging you, Ms. MacGruder, please,

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:29.190
please, don't stand in the way
of that happening.

01:07:32.028 --> 01:07:33.086
Hi.

01:07:33.596 --> 01:07:34.893
Hi.

01:07:35.398 --> 01:07:37.161
How are you guys doing?

01:07:37.233 --> 01:07:40.532
Fine, especially Charlie.

01:07:40.603 --> 01:07:42.628
Yeah, he seems to have
liked his lunch so much

01:07:42.705 --> 01:07:44.730
that he's decided to wear it.

01:07:46.008 --> 01:07:47.908
I'll go get a wash rag.

01:07:49.078 --> 01:07:50.409
Here. Hey.

01:07:57.987 --> 01:08:00.683
- How much of that did you hear?
- Most of it.

01:08:00.757 --> 01:08:02.247
Do you think her story's for real?

01:08:02.325 --> 01:08:04.725
That's what I intend to find out.

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:09.425
Why don't you pull up a chair
and tell me more

01:08:09.499 --> 01:08:11.694
about the trouble Violet's
got herself into.

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:17.428
I'm afraid your daughter's
been arrested for child abandonment.

01:08:17.506 --> 01:08:18.974
You mean she just left him?

01:08:19.509 --> 01:08:21.841
Like in a grocery store or something?

01:08:22.578 --> 01:08:24.546
'Cause that doesn't make any sense.

01:08:24.613 --> 01:08:27.174
I mean, Violet loves that baby.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:29.411
When was the last time you talked to her?

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:30.712
Not long ago.

01:08:30.787 --> 01:08:33.915
Came by here looking for a handout,
like usual.

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.287
Said she'd gotten fired again.

01:08:36.893 --> 01:08:38.656
I told her that if she
couldn't care for the kid,

01:08:38.728 --> 01:08:40.389
she ought to give him
to somebody who could,

01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:44.421
but I didn't mean that she should,
you know, dump him or anything.

01:08:45.134 --> 01:08:46.658
Did you know the child's father?

01:08:46.736 --> 01:08:49.000
Never brought him around.

01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:52.734
Got himself killed, apparently,
serving in the military.

01:08:52.809 --> 01:08:56.506
They was never actually married,
so she don't get no benefits.

01:08:56.578 --> 01:08:59.139
At least that's what the boy's father said
when I asked.

01:08:59.215 --> 01:09:01.240
The boy's father?

01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:04.309
That's who the man said he was, anyway.

01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:06.981
Called here twice looking for Violet.

01:09:08.124 --> 01:09:10.591
I wouldn't have told him where she was
even if I'd known,

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.087
rude as he was.

01:09:14.296 --> 01:09:15.524
Rockland?

01:09:15.598 --> 01:09:17.657
About an hour's drive from here,
on the coast.

01:09:17.733 --> 01:09:19.564
Said he builds boats.

01:09:20.736 --> 01:09:23.432
So tell me again what you've got to do
with all this?

01:09:24.006 --> 01:09:28.067
I am the person
with whom Violet left her baby.

01:09:30.712 --> 01:09:32.078
No kidding?

01:09:33.015 --> 01:09:36.143
And what, now you don't want him no more?

01:09:39.455 --> 01:09:43.390
Thank you, Mrs. Johnson.
You've been really informative.

01:09:50.265 --> 01:09:54.669
Wow. What do you think?
Should we buy her?

01:09:55.738 --> 01:10:01.040
Sail the world, you and me and Peyton?

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:04.773
What do you think? Should we do that?
Should we buy this baby?

01:10:04.847 --> 01:10:06.212
Hey, King!

01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.907
- Hey!
- How are you?

01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:10.350
Hey.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.353
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:10:12.421 --> 01:10:14.048
I see you brought a shipmate
with you this time.

01:10:14.123 --> 01:10:17.320
Yeah, Harry, this is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Harry.

01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:19.623
- Hey, Charlie.
- How you doing?

01:10:19.695 --> 01:10:21.185
You guys want something to drink?

01:10:21.264 --> 01:10:24.597
Well, Charlie here just polished
off a bottle, but I wouldn't mind.

01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:26.362
- Come on board.
- Great.

01:10:26.435 --> 01:10:28.266
What do you say, bud? Come on.

01:10:29.138 --> 01:10:30.901
That your little guy?

01:10:31.507 --> 01:10:36.308
Thanks. No, just watching
him for a couple days, is all.

01:10:36.379 --> 01:10:37.869
You have kids?

01:10:37.947 --> 01:10:41.041
One of my many regrets, no, I do not.

01:10:42.518 --> 01:10:45.851
If you could, at this stage of the game,
would you?

01:10:45.922 --> 01:10:49.517
You mean, assuming my wife
wasn't kicking me out on my keister?

01:10:49.592 --> 01:10:51.583
Yeah, in a nanosecond.

01:10:51.661 --> 01:10:53.026
Really?

01:10:53.095 --> 01:10:55.723
You wouldn't mind being the oldest dad
on the playground?

01:10:55.831 --> 01:10:58.391
The only person I compete with is myself.

01:10:58.467 --> 01:11:02.665
Besides, my timing's my timing, right?
It's not anybody else's business.

01:11:02.738 --> 01:11:04.672
Who wouldn't want to spend
the second half of their life

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.173
teaching a young sailor like Charlie here

01:11:06.242 --> 01:11:09.109
how to navigate the world
better than you ever did?

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.339
Right, Charlie? There he is.

01:11:25.127 --> 01:11:26.492
Mr. Weston?

01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:29.497
Mr. Weston?

01:11:29.599 --> 01:11:31.260
Mr. Weston!

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.262
Hi.

01:11:35.338 --> 01:11:38.273
I'm Peyton MacGruder.
I'm sorry, I tried to call, but...

01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:40.332
Yeah, I got your message.

01:11:40.843 --> 01:11:43.141
Can we talk for a few minutes?

01:11:43.212 --> 01:11:45.407
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

01:11:45.481 --> 01:11:47.449
I'll be quick.

01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:49.484
I'm here about Violet Johnson.

01:11:50.252 --> 01:11:51.651
Why you and not her?

01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:53.518
She...

01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:54.578
She what?

01:11:55.925 --> 01:11:58.018
She doesn't know that I'm here.

01:11:58.094 --> 01:12:02.622
Look, I don't know what you're playing at,
but I don't want any part of it.

01:12:02.698 --> 01:12:05.394
I don't eat. I don't sleep.

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:08.096
All I do is work
and think about what might have been.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.605
You talk to Violet,

01:12:13.542 --> 01:12:16.739
tell her to find the spine
to come see me herself.

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.028
Hey.

01:12:43.105 --> 01:12:45.369
Hey. What'd you learn?

01:12:46.308 --> 01:12:49.334
Violet's having a pretty rough go of it.

01:12:53.049 --> 01:12:58.612
You know, I always dreamt of finding
the kind of innocent love that would be,

01:12:59.255 --> 01:13:02.452
I don't know, kind of
like a riot in my heart.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:08.429
I never thought I would feel
that kind of love again.

01:13:10.433 --> 01:13:13.266
And then Charlie came into our lives.

01:13:15.237 --> 01:13:19.367
And opened up my heart to
so many possibilities.

01:13:21.143 --> 01:13:22.940
I love you, you know?

01:13:26.415 --> 01:13:30.408
Thank God for that.
Otherwise, why would you put up with me?

01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:36.486
There's an ordinance against doing
that sort of thing on public property.

01:13:36.559 --> 01:13:37.958
So what happened?

01:13:38.027 --> 01:13:41.121
Went fairly well for a preliminary hearing.

01:13:41.197 --> 01:13:44.291
The judge was nice enough,
but kind of formal.

01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:46.425
Asked a lot of questions.

01:13:48.704 --> 01:13:50.001
There you go.

01:13:50.072 --> 01:13:53.508
He seemed to understand I left Charlie
'cause I was desperate.

01:13:53.576 --> 01:13:56.602
Definitely knew
I was gonna come back for him, but...

01:13:56.679 --> 01:13:59.842
The judge wants to know
that it won't happen again,

01:13:59.915 --> 01:14:02.475
that Charlie will be safe with Violet,

01:14:02.551 --> 01:14:05.782
before she can consider
returning him to her custody.

01:14:05.855 --> 01:14:08.380
How can you show her that?

01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:11.255
Got to find a way before
next week's hearing.

01:14:12.528 --> 01:14:13.927
Otherwise...

01:14:20.569 --> 01:14:24.164
I don't get it. If Violet had anybody
she could turn to for support,

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.367
she wouldn't have left Charlie with us.

01:14:26.442 --> 01:14:29.172
What does the judge expect her to do
now that she didn't do before?

01:14:29.245 --> 01:14:33.204
Her job is to protect Charlie,
not try to solve Violet's problems for her.

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:35.409
So? There must be something we can do.

01:14:35.484 --> 01:14:38.510
I talked to Pastor Newton
about subsidized daycare.

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:40.418
He'll look into it. He isn't hopeful.

01:14:40.489 --> 01:14:42.150
We're in a rural area.

01:14:42.224 --> 01:14:46.524
There's only one center in the vicinity
and it's got a long wait list.

01:14:46.595 --> 01:14:50.122
Peyton told me about Violet's mother.
She sounds like a piece of work.

01:14:50.199 --> 01:14:52.759
And apparently,
Charlie's grandfather on the other side,

01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:54.598
he won't even talk to Peyton.

01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:56.297
So what do we do?

01:15:03.646 --> 01:15:05.978
I went to see your mother today.

01:15:06.048 --> 01:15:07.072
You what?

01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:09.709
I needed to find out for myself

01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:14.484
why you couldn't come up with a better
option than just leaving Charlie with us.

01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:19.149
Look, I guess I should have told you
before I went up there, but...

01:15:19.228 --> 01:15:21.822
it's okay, I understand.

01:15:22.765 --> 01:15:28.931
She did tell me that she tried to
encourage you to give up the baby.

01:15:29.672 --> 01:15:31.003
Can you imagine?

01:15:31.073 --> 01:15:33.007
Yeah, I can.

01:15:33.075 --> 01:15:34.838
My father did more than encourage.

01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:37.902
He actually arranged for
my baby's adoption.

01:15:39.114 --> 01:15:40.979
How could you forgive him for that?

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:44.110
It took a very long time

01:15:44.186 --> 01:15:47.053
before he reached out to me,

01:15:47.122 --> 01:15:50.614
and when he did, I realized that,

01:15:50.693 --> 01:15:55.494
misguided as he was, he thought he was
doing what was best for me and my baby.

01:15:56.899 --> 01:16:01.893
And that one decision
cost him his grandchild

01:16:01.971 --> 01:16:03.939
and his daughter.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.274
- That's a big price to pay.
- Yeah. It really is.

01:16:09.478 --> 01:16:12.914
So I also went to see Hugh Weston.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:17.609
Yeah, he's not the most
sociable guy, is he?

01:16:18.654 --> 01:16:20.281
He's okay.

01:16:20.356 --> 01:16:21.721
Violet, if that were true,

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:26.090
why wouldn't you go to him when
you found yourself in need, instead of us?

01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:28.095
He blames me.

01:16:28.163 --> 01:16:30.131
Blames you?

01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:32.030
When Zach's mom died,

01:16:32.101 --> 01:16:35.969
Zach became his dad's reason to live.

01:16:36.038 --> 01:16:39.565
He was his Scout Master,
his Little League coach.

01:16:39.642 --> 01:16:42.475
He took a night class in algebra
so he could tutor Zach.

01:16:43.078 --> 01:16:46.673
And when Zach got a scholarship to State,
his dad threw a big party in the backyard,

01:16:46.782 --> 01:16:49.512
and he cried like a baby
when he toasted his son.

01:16:50.686 --> 01:16:52.085
Zach was everything to him.

01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:55.146
And, what, you didn't fit the dream?

01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:58.716
I did. He liked me fine.
He treated me like family,

01:16:59.995 --> 01:17:02.429
just until I got pregnant.

01:17:02.498 --> 01:17:04.966
Surely he knows that it takes two.

01:17:05.034 --> 01:17:06.661
Of course, but...

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.601
But what?

01:17:10.673 --> 01:17:13.005
Well, Zach didn't want to burden his dad.

01:17:13.075 --> 01:17:17.307
He didn't have any money, not really,
and of course, neither did we.

01:17:18.547 --> 01:17:22.540
Zach said we'd created the situation
and we would deal with it.

01:17:22.651 --> 01:17:23.913
By joining the Army?

01:17:23.986 --> 01:17:25.453
Well, I was still only 17,

01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:27.386
so we couldn't get married
till after my birthday,

01:17:27.456 --> 01:17:30.050
which was right before Zach's first leave.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:33.617
Once we did, though,
I would get spousal benefits,

01:17:33.696 --> 01:17:38.224
health insurance, prenatal care,
parenting classes, the works.

01:17:39.101 --> 01:17:40.261
"It was a no-brainer."

01:17:40.636 --> 01:17:42.399
That's what he said.

01:17:43.772 --> 01:17:45.831
And what did his father say?

01:17:46.642 --> 01:17:47.939
Have you lost your mind?

01:17:48.010 --> 01:17:49.238
It makes sense.

01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:52.178
To risk your life
in some godforsaken war zone

01:17:52.247 --> 01:17:53.976
just 'cause you knocked up your girlfriend?

01:17:54.049 --> 01:17:55.482
That makes sense to you?

01:17:55.551 --> 01:18:00.352
I'm gonna marry Violet and take care
of her, like you took care of Mom.

01:18:00.422 --> 01:18:03.619
It's my responsibility
and I intend to live up to it.

01:18:03.692 --> 01:18:06.627
That's what you taught me.
That's what I'm gonna do.

01:18:06.695 --> 01:18:07.957
Whether I agree or not?

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:12.831
It's my decision and it's been made.
The enlistment papers are already signed.

01:18:14.937 --> 01:18:17.701
Come on, Violet, we're out of here.

01:18:20.409 --> 01:18:21.933
I'm sorry.

01:18:22.511 --> 01:18:25.776
Anything happens to my boy, it's on you.

01:18:27.182 --> 01:18:30.948
I hope you can live with that.
I hope we both can!

01:18:35.958 --> 01:18:37.084
Violet,

01:18:37.159 --> 01:18:40.060
are you sure that he still feels that way?

01:18:43.499 --> 01:18:45.626
But you haven't asked him, have you?

01:18:46.335 --> 01:18:48.769
Well, I haven't been brave enough.

01:18:48.837 --> 01:18:51.601
So he's never even met Charlie?

01:18:53.442 --> 01:18:54.466
No.

01:19:00.349 --> 01:19:05.343
We know love flows and ebbs, dear readers,
and flows again.

01:19:05.421 --> 01:19:09.915
We know anger turns to resentment,
or guilt, or forgiveness.

01:19:09.992 --> 01:19:15.760
But how can we guess in which directions
another's emotional tides may have turned?

01:19:15.831 --> 01:19:21.326
How can we summon the courage to revisit
the painful moments of our pasts,

01:19:21.403 --> 01:19:25.737
if we cannot predict the effect of time
on the human heart?

01:19:25.808 --> 01:19:27.070
A column?

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:30.340
More like a diary entry.

01:19:30.412 --> 01:19:34.007
I can't really print
most of what I've been typing lately.

01:19:34.817 --> 01:19:36.284
Thank you.

01:19:40.222 --> 01:19:41.280
King?

01:19:41.824 --> 01:19:46.386
I think I know how Violet can convince
the judge to let her keep her baby.

01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:54.660
I just have to help Violet
to find the strength to do her part.

01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:09.176
- Look, I thought I told you last time...
- Please. Please.

01:20:12.187 --> 01:20:13.211
Hi.

01:20:16.325 --> 01:20:18.020
Look, Mr. Weston,

01:20:19.294 --> 01:20:20.818
when I was Violet's age,

01:20:20.896 --> 01:20:23.694
I had a falling out with my dad.

01:20:23.765 --> 01:20:29.260
I wish that I had her strength,
and I went to him to make amends.

01:20:29.338 --> 01:20:30.532
I didn't.

01:20:30.606 --> 01:20:34.235
And because of that, we didn't come
back together again for years.

01:20:34.309 --> 01:20:36.436
Violet needs you in her life.

01:20:36.512 --> 01:20:39.310
Her baby needs you in his life,

01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:42.316
and as presumptuous as this may sound,

01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:45.148
I'm betting that you need
both of them in yours.

01:20:46.155 --> 01:20:48.316
She's here to offer you a chance

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:52.156
to choose understanding over anger,

01:20:52.928 --> 01:20:55.954
forgiveness over resentment.

01:20:59.234 --> 01:21:01.065
I don't resent Violet.

01:21:01.603 --> 01:21:03.298
I resented God

01:21:03.372 --> 01:21:06.034
and blamed him for taking my son.

01:21:06.108 --> 01:21:10.010
I've been working hard to try
and understand why he'd do that to me.

01:21:13.148 --> 01:21:14.809
To us.

01:21:22.691 --> 01:21:24.682
For months now,

01:21:26.128 --> 01:21:28.460
I've been trying to find you, Violet,

01:21:28.530 --> 01:21:31.192
tell you how sorry I am for my words.

01:21:33.235 --> 01:21:36.727
For blaming you for something
that wasn't your fault.

01:21:38.006 --> 01:21:40.770
For not offering to share our grief.

01:21:40.842 --> 01:21:42.571
I let Zach down.

01:21:43.745 --> 01:21:46.179
I let you down. I let myself down.

01:21:49.885 --> 01:21:52.877
If you can find it in
yourself to forgive me,

01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:58.385
I'd give anything to meet my grandson.

01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:12.668
How often, dear readers,
are we misled by the fear

01:22:12.741 --> 01:22:15.437
that broken hearts cannot be mended,

01:22:16.845 --> 01:22:20.144
that tortured relations cannot be repaired,

01:22:20.215 --> 01:22:23.275
that gestures of love
will not be reciprocated?

01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:26.950
The woman who left her child with me

01:22:27.022 --> 01:22:32.085
has been joyfully and permanently
reunited with her little boy.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:36.392
A family court judge has determined that
the temporary abandonment of her infant

01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:39.559
was done under extenuating circumstances,

01:22:39.635 --> 01:22:42.900
in an ill-considered effort
to protect the child.

01:22:43.839 --> 01:22:46.137
Having moved in with the child's granddad,

01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:49.405
our young friend has
been able to find work.

01:22:49.478 --> 01:22:53.209
And all three, mother,
child and grandparent,

01:22:53.282 --> 01:22:56.183
have begun rebuilding their lives together.

01:22:58.086 --> 01:23:00.486
Who's that? It's Mom!

01:23:01.923 --> 01:23:03.413
Here you go.

01:23:07.896 --> 01:23:12.299
What lessons, then, can we glean
from this potentially tragic story

01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:14.597
with a thankfully happy ending?

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:15.967
Sure is quiet around here.

01:23:20.409 --> 01:23:22.809
I liked it better the way it was.

01:23:23.478 --> 01:23:24.740
Me, too.

01:23:26.948 --> 01:23:30.748
You know, not all kids
are as lucky as Charlie, King.

01:23:31.787 --> 01:23:33.482
Maybe we should try to change that

01:23:34.389 --> 01:23:38.052
for one kid who needs somebody
to love them.

01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:41.028
- One?
- One!

01:23:44.266 --> 01:23:45.756
To start with.

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:56.177
Time to go. Are you ready?

01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:59.708
- Just a couple minutes.
- Okay.

01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:20.591
The heart, my friends,
is a remarkable organ.

01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:24.196
It generally ignores our
carefully laid plans

01:24:24.272 --> 01:24:28.436
in favor of unexpected
opportunities for love.

01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.499
Hey.

01:24:29.911 --> 01:24:31.378
- Hello.
- Don't you look spiffy.

01:24:31.446 --> 01:24:34.643
Did you get all gussied up
to wish us bon voyage?

01:24:34.716 --> 01:24:38.948
Nope, I got gussied up to go on a
sailboat ride with my friend, Harry.

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.012
Thanks to King here.
Come give me some sugar.

01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:43.481
Have fun.

01:24:43.558 --> 01:24:46.959
The lesson, then, is a simple one,
dear readers.

01:24:47.028 --> 01:24:50.964
We inspire one another,
not by the things we say,

01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:53.964
but by the things we do.

01:24:54.035 --> 01:24:55.593
And believing that,

01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:59.731
we can be assured goodness
will be passed on

01:24:59.808 --> 01:25:02.606
in ways we don't always expect,

01:25:02.677 --> 01:25:07.171
when we open our hearts
to the most helpless among us.
