Unfortunately, there's
still a serious issue

06:07.167 --> 06:09.670
we have to deal with.
Kitty has cervical fractures.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.539
She broke her neck.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.542
Luckily, we can repair it
by fusing her spine.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.744
Your range of motion
will be restricted,

06:16.810 --> 06:18.311
but when
everything else heals,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.548
you should be walking
within three months.

They should've just left me
on that mountain to die.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.263
Then I think you'll prefer
the second option...

06:36.329 --> 06:38.398
The Odontoid
Screw Procedure.

06:38.466 --> 06:39.633
It doesn't involve
vertebral fusion

06:39.700 --> 06:41.969
and could maintain
your full range of motion.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.937
Seriously?
Sign me up!

06:44.004 --> 06:47.274
The spinal fusion surgery
is generally preferred

06:47.340 --> 06:49.042
because it has
higher healing rates

06:49.109 --> 06:51.044
and more favorable
long-term results.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.880
But the screw procedure's
less invasive,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.515
so there's reduced
collateral injury

06:54.582 --> 06:55.716
and no permanent damage.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.653
Would she be able
to climb again?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.121

a group home?

07:29.683 --> 07:32.352

To strangers?

07:32.419 --> 07:33.787
To professionals
who can help him.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.255
He was abandoned
by his father.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.790
I'm all
that he has left.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.797
God, he was
such a beautiful baby.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.936
And he was perfectly normal,
walking, talking...

07:51.071 --> 07:54.074
But just after
he turned two,

07:54.141 --> 07:55.543
we noticed a change.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.011
He started to lose his words.
He was going backwards.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.248
When we got
the test results,

08:04.084 --> 08:07.821
everything we'd hoped for
our perfect, little boy was...

08:07.888 --> 08:09.289
Was gone.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.893

he was too much

before his growth spurt

(SCOFFS)

08:22.803 --> 08:25.873
I don't want to give him up.
I... I just...

08:25.939 --> 08:28.676
I just wanted a break
for one lousy night.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.411
Nobody blames you
for that, Nicole.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.281
And you don't have to
send your son anywhere.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.584

for a kid like Mac.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.535
Your room's on the left.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.776
Yes, it would.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.983
Then he'd get used to it.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.656
It started with a broken arm
and a concussion.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.626
The next time, it was
a shattered femur and
a ruptured spleen,

09:18.692 --> 09:20.127
then a broken pelvis,

09:20.193 --> 09:21.829
then a skull fracture

09:21.895 --> 09:23.931
that put her into a coma
for three days.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.905
Okay, when I climb,
adrenaline is the enemy.

09:31.972 --> 09:36.176
I need to be calm,
relaxed, and focused,
or this happens.

09:36.243 --> 09:40.280
You've always wanted
me to believe I can
do anything I want.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.583
Each time that I summit,
every roadblock in my life
melts away.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.495
I don't want
to get to it.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.831
I want to talk
about the rest of it.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.799
I want to talk about
the... The...

12:45.866 --> 12:47.734
The Usher parties
and the ties.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.903
Why can't we talk
about your track meets?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.704
Because we're past that,
Daddy.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.875
We need to talk about why
you're talking to a ghost,

12:54.942 --> 12:57.710
why I'm not
sitting here for real,
holding my father's hand.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.279
Good dreams, please.
Good dreams.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.513
You want good dreams?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.415
Go ahead.
Take your pill.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.059
This has got to happen, Daddy.
You know it.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.001
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

13:23.971 --> 13:26.940
What if they're right?
What if we are,
in effect,

13:27.007 --> 13:29.542
killing their daughter
by giving her the surgery
she wants?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.946
These are not issues
doctors should think about.

13:33.013 --> 13:36.516
That's what we tell ourselves
because it makes it easier
for us to just do our job

13:36.583 --> 13:38.318
and not worry about whether
we're helping or hurting.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.587
For all we know,
on her next climb,

13:40.653 --> 13:41.955
she may meet
her soul mate.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.056
(EXHALES)

13:43.123 --> 13:45.092
If, on the other hand,

13:45.158 --> 13:47.060
you're not God and,
like the rest of us,

13:47.127 --> 13:49.096
you have no idea
what will happen to her,

13:49.162 --> 13:51.598
then you should
back off.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.167
Focus on
the medical issues,

13:54.234 --> 13:57.037
because as long as Kitty's
a competent adult,

13:57.104 --> 13:58.471
it's all moot.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.176
This is
the two-bedroom.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.245
The one-bedroom went
about an hour ago.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.714
Oh, no.
I wanted the one.

14:07.780 --> 14:11.985
Sorry. This has
a much bigger living room
and a much better view.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.421
And a much
bigger price.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.960
Oh, I didn't know
it had a fireplace!

14:20.027 --> 14:22.295
Damn it, Willow, I just
fell in love with this place,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.531
which is just cruel, since
I definitely can't afford it.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.934
You fall in love
very quickly.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.068
Shaun?

14:29.736 --> 14:34.574
I found a cheaper apartment
with comparable amenities.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.076
I wrote down the address.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.177
What are you doing here?

14:37.244 --> 14:40.914
You said you hated
apartment hunting,

14:40.981 --> 14:42.815
so I decided
to help you.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.119
That's being nice.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.488
And don't forget
about the doughnut.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.757
That isn't being nice.
It's being creepy.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.960
Did you follow me here?
(CHUCKLING) No.

the rental address

this morning.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.766
That is creepy, too.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.601
You know, I didn't ask
for your help, Shaun.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.703
I do not need your help,
and I don't want your help.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.617
LEO: Katherine, if you won't
reconsider this surgery...

15:17.684 --> 15:20.120

...then we have to consider
other options.

weekends, holidays...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.683
I was working
my ass off.
That's just an excuse.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.085
You were avoiding me.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.486
Oh, I was avoiding you?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.622
When I was home,
you paid no attention to me

I had to say.

He's not a friend.

if you weren't psychotic,

16:15.542 --> 16:17.277
it could be
a lot worse.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.679
It could be an indicator
of surgical complications,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.681
like infection
or cerebral ischemia.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.316

say that, Kitty?

two overbearing parents

Mom, what I meant is,
people take risks
all the time,

17:24.477 --> 17:26.879
risks that reduce
their lifespan,

17:26.946 --> 17:29.282
every time they get into a car
or they smoke a cigarette.

the same thing,

I'd been dumped on Twitter.

And I'd called my parents
as soon as I had done it.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.100
It was hardly
a suicide attempt.

her parents want

will make her
an invalid.

to be a top athlete,

18:39.486 --> 18:41.588

will be minor.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.658
She'll be able to enjoy
an active and safe lifestyle.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.027
That minor impairment
could be as much

18:48.094 --> 18:50.563
as a 50% restriction
of head rotation

18:50.630 --> 18:52.832
and a reduction
in flexion extension.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.201
That's worst-case
scenario.

hobble an adult woman?

Adult? She's 18.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.979
It's the definition.

19:07.046 --> 19:10.049
And two months ago,
she was 17
and a helpless child?

19:10.116 --> 19:12.452
I mean, she's obviously
just as immature

19:12.519 --> 19:13.686

as ever.

This is about your mother,

could've controlled her,
you would've prevented

41:34.726 --> 41:38.329
You want to try
that song again?

41:41.800 --> 41:43.935
(SIGHING) Oh, yes!

41:44.002 --> 41:46.204
Then, okay.
(BAG THUDS)

41:49.608 --> 41:51.009
Okay.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.114
(ISLANDS IN THE STREAM PLAYS)

41:56.181 --> 41:58.850
BOTH:
* Tender love is blind

41:58.917 --> 42:02.153
* It requires
* It requires a dedication

42:02.220 --> 42:04.856
* All this love we feel

42:04.923 --> 42:06.524
* Needs no...
I went bigger.

42:06.592 --> 42:08.994
* We ride it together

42:09.060 --> 42:10.796
* Uh-huh

42:10.862 --> 42:14.265
* Making love...
I rented that apartment
you liked for us to share.

42:14.332 --> 42:17.569
* Oh, oh
Islands in the stream

42:17.636 --> 42:19.638
* That is what we are

42:19.705 --> 42:21.740
* No one in between

42:21.807 --> 42:23.675
* How can we be wrong? *

42:25.410 --> 42:27.478
