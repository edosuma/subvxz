03:48.370 --> 03:50.403
<i>So how will GPEC
be able to help?</i>

03:58.914 --> 04:00.380
<i>And that was
Peter Wu from GPEC...</i>

04:00.382 --> 04:02.582
Brilliant.
Everything he says is on point.

04:02.584 --> 04:04.050
What do you think, Mark?

04:04.052 --> 04:07.821
I really hope he can
be helpful to the people there.

04:07.823 --> 04:10.256
I know it's a challenge to
fill in for Peter last minute,

04:10.258 --> 04:12.459
but entertaining
the delegation is way better

04:12.461 --> 04:14.160
than being in Africa,
am I right?

04:14.162 --> 04:16.396
Let's impress
the Lvhan delegates tonight.

04:16.398 --> 04:18.832
Tomorrow, we send them off
to Sydney and then China.

04:18.834 --> 04:21.166
Mission accomplished, mate.

04:22.571 --> 04:24.537
Anyway, it's just
icing on the cake.

04:24.539 --> 04:26.573
Peter assured me
it's all on the up and up,

04:26.575 --> 04:28.408
and he is our Chinese expert.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.211
As long as
the delegation is happy.

04:31.213 --> 04:33.613
You and Peter
are indeed very different.

04:33.615 --> 04:37.617
You're a family man. He's a
workaholic with no attachments.

04:37.619 --> 04:41.020
- But I love you both.
- Thank you.

04:41.022 --> 04:44.257
Mr Song! Welcome
to the Twelve Apostles!

04:45.993 --> 04:47.726
I really respect
your professionalism, Mr Song.

04:49.131 --> 04:51.331
It is our honour
to work with your group.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.665
We're almost there.

04:55.070 --> 04:56.803
- Ms Zhou! How are you?
- <i>Ni hao.</i>

04:56.805 --> 04:58.338
Sorry for making
you work so hard

04:58.340 --> 05:00.073
when you're not
feeling well, but I'm sure

05:00.075 --> 05:01.474
your husband will
really appreciate it.

05:01.476 --> 05:04.978
Yes. He just wants me
to let you know he's very happy.

05:04.980 --> 05:06.880
Excellent. Well,
you take care of yourself.

05:06.882 --> 05:10.817
Mark. Everyone,
Mark is our new Peter.

05:10.819 --> 05:13.086
He'll take good care
of all of you.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.292
Great. Let's go have
some fun, hey?

05:19.294 --> 05:21.828
Ms Zhou. Mr Song.

05:22.564 --> 05:24.030
Follow me.

05:28.570 --> 05:31.437
- Ms Zhou?
- Thank you.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.454
Peter invited
such a big group.

05:48.456 --> 05:50.356
I can't believe
he actually knows them all.

05:50.358 --> 05:52.192
So, who's that?

05:56.598 --> 05:57.730
James.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.132
- Mr Song.
- Oh, hey.

05:59.134 --> 06:00.800
I hope you're enjoying
tonight's festivities.

06:00.802 --> 06:03.803
Mr Yang, congratulations
on becoming a grandfather.

06:03.805 --> 06:05.405
Oh, thank you, thank you.

06:22.457 --> 06:24.224
Sorry.

07:07.335 --> 07:09.669
Peter,
didn't your doctor tell you

07:09.671 --> 07:11.971
that diabetes and alcohol
doesn't mix?

07:11.973 --> 07:13.773
And Ms Zhou, she has a cold.

07:13.775 --> 07:16.075
Neither of you
should be drinking!

07:16.077 --> 07:18.211
Actually, this deal
is very important.

07:18.213 --> 07:20.179
I'm just worried about Mark.

07:20.181 --> 07:22.916
His mind is never
fully on the job.

07:22.918 --> 07:25.385
I should be the one
working here.

07:25.387 --> 07:28.888
Mark, remember that time,
the rowing race?

07:28.890 --> 07:32.125
We lost it all because
you didn't check the gate.

07:32.127 --> 07:34.694
Why do you bring this up now?

07:34.696 --> 07:36.429
Mark...

07:37.432 --> 07:38.831
..check the gate.

07:38.833 --> 07:43.102
Don't you know? It's the most
important thing before a race.

07:43.104 --> 07:44.570
Peter, you must be exhausted.

07:44.572 --> 07:47.740
Let's talk about Africa
tomorrow. I'm sorry.

07:47.742 --> 07:50.143
What you need
is a good night's rest.

07:50.145 --> 07:51.311
Sorry.

07:51.313 --> 07:53.980
Mark,
this deal is really important!

07:53.982 --> 07:57.283
Don't be stupid!
Remember, check the gate!

07:57.285 --> 07:59.485
No mistakes!

07:59.487 --> 08:01.521
Sorry.
Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.223
He's a little tired.
He's just had a big trip.

08:04.225 --> 08:07.260
Go ahead, have a good night,
OK? Please...

10:15.390 --> 10:16.856
Huh...

10:46.888 --> 10:48.721
Hah!

11:46.748 --> 11:48.447
Uh...

13:50.938 --> 13:52.705
<i>The tropical cyclone
which caused</i>

13:52.707 --> 13:54.774
<i>the rainstorm this morning
has passed through.</i>

13:54.776 --> 13:56.776
<i>Communications
have been restored</i>

13:56.778 --> 13:59.278
<i>to the coastal regions,
but emergency services</i>

13:59.280 --> 14:01.981
<i>will continue to work
throughout the night...</i>

16:09.510 --> 16:11.410
<i>It has been
confirmed this morning</i>

16:11.412 --> 16:13.712
<i>that a Gulfstream 650 aircraft</i>

16:13.714 --> 16:16.415
<i>belonging to Grand Power
Energy Corporation, GPEC...</i>

16:18.019 --> 16:21.620
<i>..and has crashed into the ocean
near the Twelve Apostles.</i>

16:21.622 --> 16:23.889
<i>It is believed
the plane took off</i>

16:23.891 --> 16:26.425
<i>sometime this morning
between 9am and 10am,</i>

16:26.427 --> 16:29.462
<i>bound for its final
destination in Sydney.</i>

16:29.464 --> 16:31.363
<i>Search and rescue aircraft</i>

16:31.365 --> 16:34.033
<i>located floating wreckage
this afternoon</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:36.135
<i>after an extensive search
of the ocean</i>

16:36.137 --> 16:37.770
<i>near the Twelve Apostles.</i>

16:37.772 --> 16:41.774
<i>So far, no survivors
have been located.</i>

16:48.916 --> 16:50.683
Mark?

16:51.986 --> 16:53.686
Mark?

16:53.688 --> 16:56.121
The chairman
just asked you a question.

16:57.325 --> 17:01.260
Sorry. I was just
thinking of the victims.

17:01.262 --> 17:04.063
Yes, of course. We all are.

17:04.065 --> 17:09.167
But let's not forget, we are
under tight scrutiny right now.

17:10.671 --> 17:14.173
I'm concerned our company
is facing some exposure.

17:14.175 --> 17:15.941
What exposure?

17:15.943 --> 17:19.811
The visit to the Twelve Apostles
was not on the official agenda.

17:19.814 --> 17:25.217
The FCPA specifically forbids
extravagant entertainment.

17:26.521 --> 17:29.955
And SEC has long arms.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.559
Siemens was once fined
$160 million

17:33.561 --> 17:35.127
and charged with bribery.

17:35.129 --> 17:38.464
We cannot allow any hint
of impropriety here.

17:38.466 --> 17:42.434
James, you were in charge.
How do you explain this?

17:42.436 --> 17:44.403
I... I relied on Peter too much,

17:44.405 --> 17:46.672
our resident "China expert".

17:46.674 --> 17:48.073
He arranged everything.

17:48.075 --> 17:51.010
He said that when
dealing with the Chinese,

17:51.012 --> 17:55.014
sometimes, you know...
this was to be expected.

17:55.016 --> 17:56.482
James.

17:56.484 --> 17:58.651
Doing business in China...

18:05.126 --> 18:06.625
What was that?

18:06.627 --> 18:09.261
He said you should
learn Chinese.

18:09.263 --> 18:10.996
Where is Peter?

18:10.998 --> 18:14.099
Yeah, I called him,
but no answer.

18:14.101 --> 18:15.367
He was there last night...

18:15.369 --> 18:17.236
..completely exhausted.

18:17.238 --> 18:18.804
Sorry.

18:19.540 --> 18:22.074
Mark, you're Chinese too.

18:22.076 --> 18:23.909
Doing business in China,

18:23.911 --> 18:28.147
are we expected to follow
the same unwritten rules?

18:29.050 --> 18:32.952
Of course not.
That would be highly unusual.

18:32.954 --> 18:36.221
So it seems like Peter
made the wrong call.

18:36.223 --> 18:38.991
I know why Peter's not here.

18:52.006 --> 18:55.074
It appears to be
suicide by insulin overdose.

18:55.076 --> 18:59.378
Suicide? Could it possibly
be an accident?

19:00.948 --> 19:04.583
Long-term diabetics
don't make mistakes like this.

19:04.585 --> 19:06.452
They know their dosage.

19:06.454 --> 19:10.889
Was he under any...
unusual stress?

19:12.326 --> 19:15.694
Finances? Marriage? Work?

19:16.931 --> 19:19.031
What a coward.

19:20.568 --> 19:22.601
GPEC mourns each and every one

19:22.603 --> 19:25.638
of our Chinese colleagues
taken in the plane crash.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.874
<i>We send our sincere condolences
to their loved ones</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:30.909
<i>and we are deeply saddened</i>

19:30.911 --> 19:34.046
<i>by the sudden departure
of our dear friends.</i>

19:34.048 --> 19:37.650
<i>In addition, we have lost two
outstanding members of our...</i>

22:38.399 --> 22:39.965
<i>Wo...</i>

26:07.908 --> 26:10.042
Hmm.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.167
- <i>Xiexie.</i>
- <i>Xiexie.</i>

28:08.929 --> 28:11.763
Fucking hell!

28:11.765 --> 28:13.298
How 'bout it, love?

28:13.300 --> 28:15.000
Come on. How about it?

28:15.002 --> 28:17.669
- Oh, you look nice.
- Sorry. Sorry.

28:50.971 --> 28:52.871
Ohh...

29:14.161 --> 29:15.760
Ugh!

29:15.762 --> 29:17.629
Oh!

29:27.975 --> 29:29.374
Ugh...

29:40.754 --> 29:42.153
Fucking idiot!

29:53.100 --> 29:56.334
- Hah!
- Whoa! Dickheads!

29:57.504 --> 29:59.904
What the...?!

29:59.906 --> 30:01.206
What's going on?!

30:02.509 --> 30:04.909
Hey, get out!

30:04.911 --> 30:06.311
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

30:06.313 --> 30:08.613
- Go on, go on, go!
- Get out of here!

30:36.310 --> 30:38.076
Arggh!

30:40.847 --> 30:42.547
Ohh!

30:47.988 --> 30:49.654
Fuck!

35:26.333 --> 35:28.032
Ah...

35:54.060 --> 35:55.760
Mmm.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.312
Excellent.

36:14.314 --> 36:16.114
- Great job, Mark.
- Thank you.

36:16.116 --> 36:17.849
Peter thought
it would take months,

36:17.851 --> 36:19.651
but you proved him wrong.

36:19.653 --> 36:21.919
I'm sure Peter tried his best.

36:21.921 --> 36:25.156
Unfortunately, the mess he made
at the Twelve Apostles

36:25.158 --> 36:27.158
almost cost us everything.

36:27.160 --> 36:28.660
But now with you on board,

36:28.662 --> 36:31.062
we have nothing
to worry about, right?

36:32.165 --> 36:34.666
Oh, I hope not.

36:35.602 --> 36:38.770
Is there anything else
we need to discuss here?

36:39.673 --> 36:43.107
Yes, if there's
anything we should know,

36:43.109 --> 36:44.842
you need to tell us now.

36:44.844 --> 36:46.711
The MOU was signed.
It went smoothly.

36:46.713 --> 36:48.312
Everything's fine.

36:48.314 --> 36:51.082
Oh, nothing.

36:56.056 --> 36:59.290
- We're done. Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.126
Hello?

37:34.060 --> 37:36.861
If there's anything else,
you know where to find me.

37:41.201 --> 37:42.900
Hello?

38:01.154 --> 38:03.287
Is he OK?

38:27.514 --> 38:29.180
Oi!

38:29.182 --> 38:31.015
Hey, are you right?

38:36.623 --> 38:38.456
Yeah, just get it done! Sorry.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.224
Over there!

38:40.226 --> 38:42.627
Hey! Careful!

38:44.664 --> 38:46.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:46.966 --> 38:48.399
Ohh!

39:40.787 --> 39:42.119
Fuck!

41:31.831 --> 41:33.264
Ahh.

42:05.431 --> 42:07.131
Huh.

46:54.654 --> 46:57.488
<i>Hey, dude...</i>

47:09.335 --> 47:11.568
<i>Good luck.</i>

49:07.653 --> 49:11.922
Good morning, Mark. Oh,
I'll just... just change this.

49:16.962 --> 49:18.195
What's this?

49:18.197 --> 49:20.464
Oh, we received the package
for Peter this morning.

49:20.466 --> 49:22.499
The front desk didn't know
what to do with it,

49:22.501 --> 49:25.169
so they thought best
to send it to his old office.

49:25.171 --> 49:26.870
Thank you, Rose.

49:27.640 --> 49:30.407
Oh, can you get
a new SIM card for me?

49:30.409 --> 49:33.043
- I lost my old phone.
- No problem.

49:50.729 --> 49:53.197
- May I take your jacket?
- OK.

49:54.133 --> 49:55.833
Enjoy.

50:14.520 --> 50:19.189
Hey, Rose, can you check
if Tom Baker's in our company?

50:19.191 --> 50:21.024
<i>One moment, please.</i>

50:38.344 --> 50:41.678
Africa. Malawi.

50:51.223 --> 50:53.891
<i>No, we don't have
a record of Tom Baker.</i>

50:53.893 --> 50:55.259
Thank you.

51:08.407 --> 51:10.140
Yeah.

53:12.998 --> 53:14.731
Oh!

53:27.579 --> 53:29.146
<i>No mistakes!</i>

53:29.148 --> 53:30.313
Oh!

53:37.956 --> 53:39.790
<i>Check the gate! No mistakes!</i>

54:23.402 --> 54:25.235
Oh!

54:47.192 --> 54:50.260
Stopping for a red light?
They must be fucking nuts!

54:56.902 --> 54:59.169
You're going the wrong way,
you fucking idiot!

55:03.008 --> 55:05.008
Stop!

55:05.744 --> 55:06.977
We lost them.

55:06.979 --> 55:09.045
Search every motel
that doesn't need ID.

55:09.047 --> 55:10.547
How do we find them?
Check their house?

55:10.549 --> 55:12.783
What the fuck's wrong with you?
He's with that woman.

55:12.785 --> 55:15.485
How can he go home?
What idiot would do that?

55:19.024 --> 55:21.458
How could she be alive?

55:21.460 --> 55:23.860
I thought she was dead.

01:00:01.973 --> 01:00:03.706
F...

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:07.710
- Go, go, go! Go, go!
- Yes!

01:00:07.712 --> 01:00:09.112
Come on, come on!

01:00:22.227 --> 01:00:26.129
Ah, Mark! Welcome! Come on over.

01:00:26.131 --> 01:00:29.566
Thank you, darling.
You are the best.

01:00:31.136 --> 01:00:32.769
How are you?

01:00:32.771 --> 01:00:34.304
All good, thanks.

01:00:34.306 --> 01:00:38.241
I'm here to pick up Daniel.
His mother is worried.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:41.111
Oh, don't worry about them.
Look at how happy they are.

01:00:43.381 --> 01:00:46.616
Sorry, but we really have to go.

01:00:49.554 --> 01:00:51.054
No problem.

01:00:51.056 --> 01:00:52.989
Bruce told me
what good friends they are.

01:00:52.991 --> 01:00:54.824
He's welcome here anytime.

01:00:54.826 --> 01:00:57.127
Bruce! Daniel's going.

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:02.332
Bruce! Say goodbye
to Daniel and Mark!

01:01:02.334 --> 01:01:04.134
Bye, Daniel and Mark!

01:01:04.136 --> 01:01:05.468
Say goodbye.

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:07.604
Bye, Mr Harrison.
Bye, guys.

01:01:07.606 --> 01:01:09.305
Mark.

01:01:10.342 --> 01:01:13.610
Family is... everything.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.214
We worked hard for this,
you and I.

01:01:21.586 --> 01:01:23.419
I'll see you Monday.

01:01:25.123 --> 01:01:26.823
Of course.

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:26.529
Absolutely.

01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:28.564
I think they
need it by Thursday...

01:05:28.566 --> 01:05:31.501
Let's get things
started. Everyone here?

01:05:31.503 --> 01:05:34.737
Everyone but Mark.

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.208
Mr Ma's office. Rose speaking.

01:05:39.210 --> 01:05:40.676
Yeah, Rose, Harrison speaking.

01:05:40.678 --> 01:05:42.779
Can you tell Mark
that the meeting's started?

01:05:42.781 --> 01:05:45.715
<i>Oh, Mr Harrison,
Mr Ma is out on leave.</i>

01:05:45.717 --> 01:05:49.719
<i>His message says he's taking
his accrued leave for a holiday.</i>

01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:51.020
A holiday?

01:05:51.022 --> 01:05:54.123
Well, can you call him and
tell him I'm looking for him?

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.492
<i>Oh, sorry, Mr Harrison.</i>

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.795
<i>I have his mobile,
waiting for a new SIM card.</i>

01:05:58.797 --> 01:06:01.164
<i>I have no way of reaching him.</i>

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:04.767
Well, Rose, do you know
where he is?

01:06:04.769 --> 01:06:07.703
Uh, I do.

01:06:07.705 --> 01:06:09.772
His name's on the manifest

01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:12.775
for this shipment of
the African relief supplies.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.946
And, uh, Rose, his assistant.

01:06:18.082 --> 01:06:20.283
I... I'm just seeing this now.

01:06:33.631 --> 01:06:34.964
Logan.

01:06:34.966 --> 01:06:38.134
How about an all-expense-paid
holiday in Africa?

01:06:38.136 --> 01:06:41.437
- To do what?
- Hunt.

01:07:39.163 --> 01:07:41.264
Oh!

01:07:43.167 --> 01:07:44.934
Arggh!

01:07:55.413 --> 01:07:58.147
Oh...

01:08:01.719 --> 01:08:03.886
Biker gangs
can be pretty scary.

01:08:03.888 --> 01:08:06.989
Fortunately,
you didn't fight him.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:12.395
Poor Tom. He was hit by a truck
last month and died.

01:08:12.397 --> 01:08:14.096
Are you sure?

01:08:14.098 --> 01:08:17.033
Huh, it's not like a white guy
gets hit here every day.

01:08:17.035 --> 01:08:20.236
Plus, he was an engineer
for that big company GPEC.

01:08:27.444 --> 01:08:29.211
Are you Chinese?

01:08:29.212 --> 01:08:30.813
- Uh-huh.
- Yes.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:33.082
Before he died,
Tom met a Chinaman here.

01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:34.517
<i>This was a crime.</i>

01:08:34.519 --> 01:08:35.952
They were having an argument.

01:08:35.953 --> 01:08:37.819
<i>I've had enough.</i>

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:40.288
- <i>I'm done with you.</i>
- <i>Tom, T...</i>

01:08:43.127 --> 01:08:44.827
<i>Tom!</i>

01:10:00.405 --> 01:10:02.171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:16.652
Thank you
for the flowers.

01:10:17.388 --> 01:10:20.690
He was the best man.
He will always be in my heart.

01:10:20.692 --> 01:10:22.625
Thank you.

01:10:22.627 --> 01:10:24.760
Hello.

01:10:26.664 --> 01:10:29.231
Take your toy and play outside.

01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:34.103
I'm lucky to have my job
as a cleaner.

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:37.306
That's how I can raise
my little ones.

01:10:40.878 --> 01:10:43.012
Don't worry about money.

01:10:43.014 --> 01:10:45.915
Here's a company cheque for Tom.

01:10:46.718 --> 01:10:48.117
I've seen it before.

01:10:48.119 --> 01:10:51.721
Tom said this money is no good.
We can't take it.

01:10:51.723 --> 01:10:54.390
After the earthquake,
he was mad.

01:10:54.392 --> 01:10:57.493
He said he couldn't work
for you people anymore.

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.530
Why?

01:11:01.532 --> 01:11:03.566
He said it was all
in his report.

01:11:03.568 --> 01:11:04.967
What report?

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:08.237
I don't know.
He never brought work home.

01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:12.975
He... he always said
home time is family time.

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:18.114
What did Tom do exactly?

01:11:18.116 --> 01:11:21.684
He was the engineer
in charge of checking the gate.

01:11:21.686 --> 01:11:22.952
"Check the gate."

01:11:22.954 --> 01:11:25.855
<i>Check the gate. Don't you know?</i>

01:11:26.624 --> 01:11:28.924
Where did he check the gate?

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.734
Here.

01:11:38.736 --> 01:11:40.903
He sent me his location...

01:11:41.773 --> 01:11:44.240
..so we could see each other.

01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:49.345
May I take a photo?

01:12:02.426 --> 01:12:05.528
- What's going on?
- High alert.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.530
- Is it gonna take long?
- No, not too long.

01:12:07.532 --> 01:12:10.966
- How are the kids?
- Oh, they're driving me crazy.

01:12:13.404 --> 01:12:15.437
- All clear!
- Go.

01:12:15.439 --> 01:12:17.473
Here we go.

01:12:29.687 --> 01:12:31.220
Hey!

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:34.557
Don't wander around. How many
times do I have to tell you?

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.258
Wait.

01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:44.533
- Who are you?
- Go!

01:12:44.535 --> 01:12:46.101
Guards! Guards!

01:12:46.103 --> 01:12:49.471
<i>Security alert!
Security alert!</i>

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:54.176
Area four! Corridor! Go!

01:12:54.178 --> 01:12:56.679
<i>Security alert...</i>

01:12:56.681 --> 01:12:58.480
Stop!

01:13:02.687 --> 01:13:04.320
Oh!

01:13:12.897 --> 01:13:15.431
Get him! Get him now!

01:13:15.433 --> 01:13:17.566
He's over there!
He's over there! After him!

01:13:17.568 --> 01:13:19.435
After him! Run!

01:13:28.913 --> 01:13:31.347
That way! That way!

01:13:31.349 --> 01:13:33.048
Get him!

01:13:34.585 --> 01:13:36.652
He's over there!
He's over there!

01:13:38.089 --> 01:13:40.856
Hey, you! Stop him! Stop him!

01:13:40.858 --> 01:13:42.658
Get him! Get him! Get him!

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.962
Stop that!

01:13:57.008 --> 01:13:58.908
Get over there!

01:14:07.685 --> 01:14:09.084
Get them! Run!

01:14:22.433 --> 01:14:25.134
They're not up here.
Search everywhere.

01:14:30.207 --> 01:14:32.541
Hey, you! Stop! Get back here!

01:14:33.911 --> 01:14:36.946
Go. Check up that way.
They're not over here.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.735
Oh!

01:17:10.634 --> 01:17:12.067
Shh.

01:17:38.496 --> 01:17:40.529
Down here,
down here, down here!

01:17:57.748 --> 01:17:59.481
Oh!

01:18:08.459 --> 01:18:10.159
Here.

01:18:11.462 --> 01:18:13.262
Oh!

01:18:52.036 --> 01:18:53.735
Huh!

01:19:43.621 --> 01:19:46.488
Thank you
for lending us Tom's car.

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.767
- It's here.
- How long have they been gone?

01:20:31.769 --> 01:20:33.802
About four or five hours.

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.640
- We'd better get a move on.
- Go.

01:22:15.272 --> 01:22:17.038
Hi, Tom!

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.507
This is Tom's car.

01:22:18.509 --> 01:22:20.842
Er, yeah. I'm his friend.
Can you help me?

01:22:20.844 --> 01:22:22.577
- Ah. Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

01:22:22.579 --> 01:22:26.381
Tom always
stays here on work trips.

01:22:26.383 --> 01:22:27.749
Want to give it a try?

01:22:27.751 --> 01:22:29.918
There's no cell reception.
Only the landline.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.156
But like my father said,
the old way is the best way.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:40.862
I miss Tom.

01:22:40.864 --> 01:22:42.731
He came here last month
to write a report

01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:44.566
and used up my last
fax machine cartridge.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:47.002
We got drunk, talked all night.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:49.037
You said Tom faxed the report?

01:22:49.039 --> 01:22:50.505
Yes.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.340
He said he'd be back soon.

01:22:52.342 --> 01:22:53.542
Thank you!

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.947
What are you doing, my friend?

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.807
Ahh!

01:24:22.032 --> 01:24:25.000
Turn right! Turn right!

01:24:25.002 --> 01:24:26.768
Arggh!

01:24:38.382 --> 01:24:40.181
Logan! Logan!

01:24:40.183 --> 01:24:42.717
Are you alright?
Are you alright?

01:25:09.379 --> 01:25:11.246
Wait! Don't go!

01:25:13.183 --> 01:25:14.950
Come back!

01:25:15.752 --> 01:25:20.121
Diamond! Diamond! Diamond!

01:27:28.518 --> 01:27:30.218
Hmm?

01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:47.435
Excuse me. May I have some?

01:27:47.437 --> 01:27:49.337
Of course.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.240
Thank you.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:54.943
One more, please.

01:27:54.945 --> 01:27:56.811
Sure.

01:28:01.551 --> 01:28:03.251
Thank you.

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:11.259
Shit.

01:30:36.773 --> 01:30:38.306
Good morning.

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.794
- Thanks for the watch.
- Thank you.

01:30:59.796 --> 01:31:01.562
No worries.

01:31:13.643 --> 01:31:15.510
Hello?

01:31:15.512 --> 01:31:17.478
<i>Mark, this is Harrison.</i>

01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.846
Harrison?

01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.815
I know you have a copy
of the report.

01:31:20.817 --> 01:31:22.517
Damaging the company's
reputation

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:24.419
has severe repercussions.

01:31:24.421 --> 01:31:26.788
- <i>Bring it to me now.</i>
- I don't have it.

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:28.723
How did you get my number?

01:31:28.725 --> 01:31:30.291
There's no need to lie.

01:31:30.293 --> 01:31:33.261
Ms Zhou is sitting right here.
She gave me your number.

01:31:33.263 --> 01:31:35.229
She told me
that you have a copy.

01:31:35.231 --> 01:31:37.565
She also told me
that you two hooked up.

01:31:38.568 --> 01:31:39.901
<i>Just bring me the report</i>

01:31:39.903 --> 01:31:41.369
<i>and I give you back the girl.</i>

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.405
<i>Come to the Mzuzu Lubinga
Hotel, room 408.</i>

01:31:45.675 --> 01:31:47.675
Give her back?

01:31:47.677 --> 01:31:49.243
You can keep her!

01:31:49.245 --> 01:31:51.813
<i>That woman is a liar, a snake!</i>

01:31:51.815 --> 01:31:53.881
I made a mistake.
She ruined my life!

01:31:53.883 --> 01:31:55.817
Listen. She fucked me!

01:31:55.819 --> 01:31:58.853
No, no, no.
I fucked her! I fucked her!

01:31:58.855 --> 01:32:00.355
- She's nothing to me!
- <i>Mark, calm down.</i>

01:32:00.357 --> 01:32:03.291
Mark! I'm the one who's
taking care of you.

01:32:03.293 --> 01:32:06.094
Bring me that report, I give you
the woman and the money back.

01:32:06.096 --> 01:32:07.929
It is a win-win situation.

01:32:07.931 --> 01:32:10.365
What money?

01:32:11.601 --> 01:32:13.768
Huh. You don't know?

01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:15.169
<i>When you were sleeping,</i>

01:32:15.171 --> 01:32:17.138
<i>your little bird
contacted her husband.</i>

01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:20.775
<i>The $10 million she wanted
is already in your account.</i>

01:32:24.781 --> 01:32:27.248
The money's in my account, huh?

01:32:29.285 --> 01:32:32.186
What is there to talk about?

01:32:32.188 --> 01:32:35.590
Do you think I'd share
the money with that bitch?

01:32:37.027 --> 01:32:40.028
Do whatever you want.

01:32:41.031 --> 01:32:43.331
Money is indeed
the root of all evil.

01:32:56.413 --> 01:33:00.548
Hey, guys. Can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:33:07.824 --> 01:33:09.657
I got him.

01:33:09.659 --> 01:33:13.127
He's definitely not coming for
her. He's heading away from us.

01:33:19.869 --> 01:33:22.970
Go. I want that report. Get it!

01:33:22.972 --> 01:33:24.972
You stay here.

Brother! Hey,
watch where you're going.

01:34:01.444 --> 01:34:03.144
Excellent.

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.713
It seems he's come to an end.

01:34:07.417 --> 01:34:09.183
Sorry.

01:34:18.661 --> 01:34:20.128
Gotcha!

Mr Ma, are you experiencing

What are you talking about?

01:39:29.439 --> 01:39:31.572
Do you think credibility

I know those reporters

And Harrison, he's fought hard
to get this back

Any untruthful rumour right now
