00:33.600 --> 00:35.560
Oh, it must be 100 degrees!

00:36.600 --> 00:37.720
Why am I wearing wool?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.830
Our driver will be here soon.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.160
Before we melt?

01:16.320 --> 01:18.160
It might be cooler inside, darling.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.040
I love it when you call me darling.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.760
I don't think I'll ever get used to it.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.360
This isn't Aldershot, is it?

01:30.440 --> 01:32.440
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.600
'Aden, where East meets West.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.870
Vital as an oil refinery,

01:41.920 --> 01:43.520
as well as a Gulf trade route.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.270
The beach here at Aden is lovely.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.310
The sand is warm

01:49.360 --> 01:51.360
and the sharks are not always hungry.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.270
The Queen has full
confidence in Aden's future

02:00.320 --> 02:04.160
describing it as the perfect
example of colonial rule.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.390
Ah... lan. Ahlan.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.680
Kaif halik? Kaif halik?

02:28.840 --> 02:31.350

02:59.120 --> 03:00.160
Yusra.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.310
What?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.520
What did you say?

03:16.600 --> 03:17.640
Hurry up, Baxter!

03:20.680 --> 03:23.440
Well, we'll miss you, sir.
All this cash we win off you.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.590
- On the Queen. All in.
- All in!

03:26.640 --> 03:29.190
- Oh, hang on, oi!
- Here we go...

03:29.240 --> 03:30.870
Wait... Shh, shh, shh.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.990
- No! No!
- Yes!

03:40.040 --> 03:43.200
I've spent two years waiting
for a fly to land on that card!

03:46.040 --> 03:47.240
What's the chances?

03:49.080 --> 03:50.350
You fixed it for me to win.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.070
Oh, no, no not me, sir. I
respect you too much, Captain.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.750
I know you better than any
soldier I've ever served with

03:55.800 --> 03:57.070
and you fixed it for me to win.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.510
How would I do that, sir, a pet
fly that understands English?

03:59.560 --> 04:02.710
So, you're telling me on my last
day I finally hit the jackpot?

04:02.760 --> 04:05.750
A good officer needs three things
-- judgment, authority and luck.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.760
- Hear, hear.
- You've got all three, sir.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.680
Thanks.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.589
- I farted on it. - No, you
didn't! - You did what?!

04:18.640 --> 04:20.950
He always puts his money
on the Queen of Hearts.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.350
I farted on it before the game started.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.430
Alison, we need to...

05:24.480 --> 05:26.280
Have a good day at the office, dear.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.760
Ey up, Sarge, Laithwaite of Arabia's here.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.080
Can I ask where you're going, sir?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.830
Off base? Sir?

05:50.880 --> 05:51.920
Doing my job.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.190
Well, it is standard
military police practise

05:55.240 --> 05:56.910
to always know where you are, sir.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.000
It's classified.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.870
Lieutenant Laithwaite is, er...

06:04.920 --> 06:06.550
What's the word I'm looking for, sir?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.190
Are you about to criticise an officer

06:08.240 --> 06:11.080
in the presence and hearing
of another officer, Baxter?

06:12.200 --> 06:14.400
The British Army is the
best in the world...

06:15.400 --> 06:18.200
.. because you always trust
the man standing next to you.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.560
Captain Page, taking a last look around?

06:56.640 --> 06:59.160
An officer's wife hanging
a bra out to dry.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.560
What's the world coming to?

07:02.800 --> 07:03.840
Sir.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.670
From the hillside above Ballinluig.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.280
It's seen me through, you have it now.

07:27.240 --> 07:29.350
They're... getting me a drum.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.990
How do you know?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.600
A good officer knows
everything his men are doing.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.840
Why didn't Ed get it?

07:38.160 --> 07:39.670
Your job.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.710
Don't know.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.320
Nothing to do with me?

07:44.880 --> 07:46.720
- No. - Oh, so you - do - know.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.430
Your husband is a good officer...

07:50.480 --> 07:51.960
So it must be me.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.880
What am I going to do without you?

08:05.920 --> 08:09.120
I think you should put some effort
into being Mrs Laithwaite...

08:13.280 --> 08:14.780
.. and maybe a bit less of that.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.120
Don't do that. Not now,
so late in the bloody day.

08:28.360 --> 08:29.400
Can we?

08:30.880 --> 08:32.039
One more time?

08:48.680 --> 08:54.960
♪ Love letters straight from your heart

09:00.280 --> 09:06.950
♪ Keep us so near while apart... ♪

Promise me you'll be safe.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.920
We said we wouldn't!

10:54.040 --> 10:57.150
It is the biggest shipment
of arms into Aden yet

10:57.200 --> 11:00.910
and they are British,
left behind after Suez.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.950
So we're supplying the
weapons and the targets?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.590
Mm-hm.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.430
The British Empire is destroying itself

11:06.480 --> 11:09.470
and we're not even making money out of it.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.550
One thing in the shipment
is not British --

11:12.600 --> 11:14.590
a Blindicide Bazooka.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.950
Belgian.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.630
- They're serious.
- Mm.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.350
And did your man get any
closer to this leader?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.440
Better than that...

11:23.000 --> 11:25.110
Abdul Kadir Hakim.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.630
He'll do anything to
get rid of the British

11:27.680 --> 11:31.710
and he wants to put on a
show to announce himself.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.800
What kind of show?

11:35.800 --> 11:39.510
He sees you as the symbol of occupation --

11:39.560 --> 11:41.840
the Royal Military Police.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.000
Maybe it's the red caps you wear.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.710
Look, they came with us --

11:56.760 --> 11:58.440
raindrops from England!

12:03.880 --> 12:05.630
Come under the umbrella, Joe.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.080
Oh, I'm fine.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.510
Tell me something I don't
know about my new husband.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.080
- Like what?
- Anything.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.240
I'm just as you see me.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.150
What if they've forgotten us?

12:28.200 --> 12:29.310
They'll be here.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.150
No, what if night comes
and it's just you and me

12:31.200 --> 12:35.640
and... and the desert and the stars?

12:37.960 --> 12:40.630
Really, afraid of planes?!

12:41.680 --> 12:43.430
Geronimo, fall in!

12:43.480 --> 12:45.180
I've got his leaving present here.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.350
Here you are. I don't know
what the locals call it.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.870
A mirwas, sir. Tight skin, small, hairy.

12:52.920 --> 12:54.790
Why would Captain Page want a drum?

12:54.840 --> 12:56.870
To remind him of your
lovely bollocks, Stoneham.

12:56.920 --> 13:00.070
He'll get a regimental plaque
for the wall. They all get that.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.110
The good ones get a piss
up in the Sergeants' Mess.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.710
The best, the very best, the
one's that you'd die for?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.430
They get something that means something.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.310
It doesn't matter what it is,
it's the fact that you give it.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.830
He's the best officer I've
served under in 20 years.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.910
Year and a half and we're still standing.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.160
So, the new man, what
do you know about him?

13:17.320 --> 13:19.870
I know that his driver's late.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.080
Eh? Oh, f...

13:22.120 --> 13:23.160
Run!

13:25.120 --> 13:28.190
So a piss up in the Sergeants' Mess?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.630
Not for you, Stoneham.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.320
You get to baby-sit the CO's boy.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.560
George, come and look!

13:40.080 --> 13:41.870
All right...

13:41.920 --> 13:43.310
Hello!

13:43.360 --> 13:45.750
I was just taking a
last look at the desert

13:45.800 --> 13:46.790
from the roof.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.320
Do you think Father Christmas will come?

13:57.600 --> 14:00.230
- Come on, George.
- I'm going to decorate the tree...

14:07.560 --> 14:10.040
Oh, hello, Mary.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.910
My fourth shower of the day.

14:13.960 --> 14:18.470
Sometimes I think it's all
I do -- sweat and wash.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.760
Perspire and ablute.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.160
The men do the sweating and the washing.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.640
What would any of us do without you?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.110
Are you all right, Alison?

14:33.160 --> 14:36.150
The walls used to sweat...

14:36.200 --> 14:39.440
Do you remember?.. in Hong Kong.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.760
We used to sit and watch the
water running down the walls.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.080
Such close relationships
we make in Army life.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.760
But we pack up and we move on.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.360
In the morning, he'll be gone.

14:59.280 --> 15:02.870
Look, we all think Ed should
have got the promotion,

15:02.920 --> 15:04.870
so it'll be hard for him with the new man.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.200
He'll need your support.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.600
This is for you and Ed.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.200
Merry Christmas, Mrs Laithwaite.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.070
What did your man say?

15:26.120 --> 15:28.950
That he's the charismatic leader
that they've all been waiting for,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.630
and to announce himself to the world,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.150
it's us red caps that he's after.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.230
What would you have me do?

15:33.280 --> 15:35.830
Send the whole unit out on night
patrol but not give Captain Page

15:35.880 --> 15:38.510
his send-off, all because your
source has a feeling in his waters?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.430
Give me permission to
interview the prisoner.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.110
- My source says he seems to know something...
- That's not possible.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.710
- Intel boys are in with him as we
speak and my orders are to... - Sir.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.910
.. leave him to stew, as
talking to these people before

15:47.960 --> 15:49.270
softening them up doesn't work.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.520
How would we know that?
Has it ever been tried?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.470
You're obeying orders.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.680
It's what we do!

16:00.440 --> 16:02.390
Don't be bitter, Ed.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.790
If you get angry because you
were passed up for promotion,

16:04.840 --> 16:06.360
you'll be passed up next time.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.310
Left, right, left!

16:35.360 --> 16:37.110
Left, left!

Trying to do my job.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.430
Well, don't. There are rules.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.590
Usually rules are written down.
Not these ones. Why not, sir?

18:18.640 --> 18:22.510
- Ed... - 72 hours of stress and
everyone talks -- that's the theory.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.030
You don't think it works?

18:24.080 --> 18:28.430
I think torture's the best
recruiting sergeant for terrorists.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.710
How long till the intel boys come back?

18:30.760 --> 18:32.590
They didn't say.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.160
Well, he's our prisoner, sir.

Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.040
Hello, Armstrong.

20:52.800 --> 20:53.910
Why?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.190
Sir?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.270
Why are you late?

20:57.320 --> 21:01.310
Well, the war doesn't stop, sir --
not at anyone's convenience, sir.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.920
Are you being facetious?

21:05.600 --> 21:07.190
I don't know, sir.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.270
It's a yes or no answer, Corporal.

21:09.320 --> 21:12.390
Well, it is if you know
what facetious means, sir.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.550
Don't do that, darling.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.590
What?

21:26.640 --> 21:29.560
He needs to know that lateness
will not be tolerated by me.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.400
Well, what did I do?

21:34.120 --> 21:37.680
You... took your sunglasses off.

21:44.840 --> 21:49.110
Er, George, darling, will
you get the angel for Mummy?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.320
Hmm?

21:51.800 --> 21:52.840
Good boy.

21:54.360 --> 21:55.760
It's a fairy.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.230
I think it's an angel.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.070
It's a fucking fairy.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.160
Oh!

22:04.040 --> 22:05.830
Where did you hear that word?

22:05.880 --> 22:07.950
Mrs Laithwaite. She says it a lot.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.350
What's the difference?

22:09.400 --> 22:10.390
Ask Daddy.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.990
Daddy!

22:12.040 --> 22:14.520
You do it, Daddy. Mummy can't reach.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.870
One, two, three...

22:23.420 --> 22:24.440
Good grief!

22:25.680 --> 22:27.750
What's Mummy feeding you these days?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.910
Up...

22:29.960 --> 22:31.200
Well done.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.680
Tidy up your cars.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.670
What is it?

22:45.720 --> 22:47.270
Nothing.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.950
It's not nothing, Mary. Tell me.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.030
The number he wants on the back of
his football shirt for Christmas.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.590
I don't understand.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.720
Have you tried sewing a number eight?

22:59.600 --> 23:02.430
Is that it? Is that all?

23:02.480 --> 23:04.040
Hmm...

23:08.080 --> 23:09.710
And you?

23:13.480 --> 23:14.720
I'm fine.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.590
She sells seashells on the seashore.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.940
The seashells that she
sells are seashells...

23:26.220 --> 23:27.390
[.. sea shore.]

23:28.440 --> 23:29.750
Come on, Joe!

23:29.800 --> 23:31.870
She sells seashells on the seashore.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.800
The seashells that she sells
are seashells, she's sure.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.230
We were playing it on the plane,

23:40.280 --> 23:42.070
but you couldn't get
it, could you, darling?

23:42.120 --> 23:44.040
Not at all. Not even slowly.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.790
We only got married a week ago.

23:48.840 --> 23:51.910
We didn't have time for a
honeymoon, so this drive is it.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.190
This is our week in Capri, Armstrong.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.630
What was he like? Captain Page?

24:14.680 --> 24:16.870
Technically he hasn't left yet.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.400
He won't be doing much
sleeping tonight, though.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.830
You haven't answered my question.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.560
We trusted him with our lives, sir.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.600
What about me? Who are my
new friends going to be?

24:43.080 --> 24:44.680
Brigadier Christmas.

25:00.920 --> 25:04.790
Captain Page came to say goodbye,

25:04.840 --> 25:07.040
which says a lot about
him, don't you think?

25:09.720 --> 25:13.150
He told me something he shouldn't have.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.230
He said everyone thinks
it should have been you.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.110
Drink?

25:18.160 --> 25:19.590
I'm on duty.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.040
Do you mind if I do?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.230
Why would he say that?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.310
Why wouldn't he?

25:26.360 --> 25:28.590
I don't know.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.480
Cos it's not true?

25:35.760 --> 25:39.430
I'm just not one of the boys, Al.

25:40.080 --> 25:40.870
Knock knock.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.270
Who's there? Come in, Mary!

25:43.320 --> 25:45.190
It was good of Nick Page.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.670
What's that?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.080
To do the farewell rounds.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.590
Oh, he brought me a sprig of heather.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.950
Such a charmer. Did he
come and see you too?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.790
And there was me thinking
I was the special one.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.990
Hmm...

26:03.040 --> 26:05.880
I'd better get off. Security checks.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.550
What would you like for Christmas?

26:28.600 --> 26:31.710
I'd give anything for a
wet weekend in Haslemere.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.150
Ah...

26:34.200 --> 26:35.560
Thank you, Jeeves.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.630
And you shall have... this one.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.400
That song again -- you'd
think she'd grow tired of it.

26:53.080 --> 26:56.430
I'm so glad I'm married to you.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.430
What a funny thing to say.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.950
I think it every day.

27:09.520 --> 27:14.830
What if it were a different number?
What if it weren't a number eight?

27:14.880 --> 27:18.350
Then my life would be
without a single wrinkle.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.350
Oh! Oh, sorry.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.750
No, no.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.630
You should go -- the wives are waiting.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.190
We should be asking her to baby-sit.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.510
No, I'd prefer Corporal Stoneham doing it.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.270
Calamine lotion for his prickly heat.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.830
Fan speed high until he goes to bed,

27:32.880 --> 27:34.910
then turn it down to the
second-slowest speed.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.790
Bedtime is straight
after Uncle Bill on BFBS.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.190
Two puffs on his asthma inhaler.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.350
Don't forget to tell Corporal
Stoneham all of this.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.630
It's important.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.920
And Green Teddy needs
his pyjamas on for bed.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.880
Ed Laithwaite took the
hood off a prisoner today.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.120
I had to put it back on.

28:02.720 --> 28:03.800
I...

28:12.480 --> 28:14.830
Goodnight, lovely boy.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.160
Goodnight, Green Teddy.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.110
You smell nice, Mummy.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.230
Oh.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.720
Fucking nice.

28:26.280 --> 28:32.150
♪ I memorise every line... ♪

28:36.280 --> 28:39.390
- Ah, two targets for
tonight, Corporal. - Sir.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.630
One -- a haircut, short and sensible.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.390
Two -- a new favourite footballer.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.630
It has to be a winger so
there's a number seven

28:45.680 --> 28:47.590
or a number 11 on his back.

28:47.640 --> 28:52.350
Achieve these, and I'll get you
mentioned in dispatches. Good lad.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.590
These are the officers' blocks.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.270
You'll be taking over Captain
Page's quarters, sir.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.510
Thank you, Corporal.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.600
Sir.

29:34.400 --> 29:35.840
- Wait.
- Hmm?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.360
Ooh!

29:51.920 --> 29:53.960
Oh, hello...

29:55.760 --> 29:57.630
M-M-Mrs Page?

30:02.720 --> 30:04.360
There's no Mrs Page.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.000
He's married to the army. They all are.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.630
Drunk.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.880
Sorry.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.560
Don't tell anyone.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.320
Ah. The new man.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.190
(Darling, we should...)

30:26.240 --> 30:27.790
- (um...)
- (Oh, yes.)

30:27.840 --> 30:29.560
Oh, God...

30:53.480 --> 30:56.510
Baxter. I don't want you
drinking tonight. Yes?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.910
- Too late, sir.
- Well, I need you to double the guard.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.120
The whole unit is on the
base, Ed. The base is secure.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.830
Sir.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.150
Sometimes the best officers
know when to switch off.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.880
Yes, sir.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.560
You need to tell me what they're planning.

32:21.520 --> 32:22.960
I know that you know.

32:33.040 --> 32:34.870
Cigarette?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.310
Shukran.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.990
I gave you an order.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.990
Now get yourself along
to the Sergeants' Mess

32:46.040 --> 32:47.790
and start behaving like a proper officer!

32:47.840 --> 32:49.390
I had him. He's about to talk.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.740
I said to leave him alone.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.080
If anything happens...

32:58.160 --> 32:59.400
.. your conscience.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.830
Sorry.

33:25.880 --> 33:29.470
We're in and out of each
other's quarters all the time.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.280
You'll see.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.520
But everyone is so looking
forward to you both.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.910
Ah!

33:42.960 --> 33:47.440
The Sergeants' Mess --
they'll be singing him out.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.760
Why don't you pop along
and they can sing you in?

33:52.760 --> 33:55.080
In with the new, out with the old?

33:56.200 --> 33:59.270
In, out, in, out, shake it all about?

34:01.480 --> 34:03.830
- Will you be all right, darling? - Yes.

34:03.880 --> 34:06.600
Course she will. We're going
to be the best of friends.

34:11.679 --> 34:13.639
Incorruptible.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.590
I don't want a haircut.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.360
I want to be a footballer.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.310
He will be the best footballer
the world has ever seen.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.389
- You watch.
- What's his name?

34:30.440 --> 34:31.590
George.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.070
Like me!

34:33.120 --> 34:34.790
Oh, yeah.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.480
He's got long hair.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.040
Yeah.

34:41.719 --> 34:43.070
What number is he?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.880
Seven. Sometimes 11.

34:48.639 --> 34:52.070
Have you ever been up
on the roof at night?

34:52.120 --> 34:55.150
- No. - What do you think you might see?

34:55.199 --> 34:56.389
The stars!

34:56.440 --> 35:00.040
How about -- I cut your hair
while you look at the stars?

35:09.600 --> 35:11.590
Promise me you won't tell your dad.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.750
Come on, then.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.030
Whoa!

35:15.080 --> 35:17.040
Wow.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.640
Let's sit down, then.

35:26.960 --> 35:31.110
You know, even the nearest
star is billions of miles away,

35:31.160 --> 35:34.360
but it still feels like you can
reach up and touch it, doesn't it?

35:51.520 --> 35:55.430
Everyone -- this is Captain
Joe Martin's wife, Honor.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.560
Honor.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.440
Wool in Aden.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.950
Your MFO boxes haven't arrived?

36:05.000 --> 36:07.630
Ah, well, none of my dresses fit.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.880
You can have them all
while I'm so enormous.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.640
I'm sorry. It should have been you.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.680
Thanks, Nick.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.870
Er, gentlemen, if I could er,
have your attention briefly.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.750
Remember this.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.600
We are the British Army and as such,
we represent Her Majesty The Queen.

36:47.640 --> 36:51.230
So I don't want to see any
drunkenness or foolishness tonight.

36:51.280 --> 36:55.350
At 22-hundred hours I shall be
retiring to my married quarters,

36:55.400 --> 36:57.670
from where, I have to inform you,

36:57.720 --> 37:02.550
that I shall be unable
to see or hear anything.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.510
A drum! You shouldn't have!

37:14.560 --> 37:18.560
- We got you something loud
and ugly, sir... - Thank you.

37:20.040 --> 37:21.360
Speech!

37:28.760 --> 37:32.150
I can't begin to... put into
words what it has meant to me

37:32.200 --> 37:35.190
to serve with all of you.

37:35.240 --> 37:40.270
Except to say that I have
been guided in everything that

37:40.320 --> 37:45.910
I've done by what some army officers
call respect for their men, others

37:45.960 --> 37:49.230
call comradeship,

37:49.280 --> 37:52.040
but which I have no hesitation
in describing as love.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.150
Hip, hip...

38:02.200 --> 38:04.880
Thank you, Baxter.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.720
I'm pregnant. It's not Ed's.

38:20.080 --> 38:22.080
Alison...

38:26.520 --> 38:28.200
I'm going to tell him.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.040
Captain Martin. Nick Page's replacement.

38:36.600 --> 38:38.040
Call me Ed. Captain.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.960
Not a drinking man?

38:43.160 --> 38:44.400
Not tonight.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.400
OK, men, this is it.

39:01.880 --> 39:03.120
OK. Done!

39:15.840 --> 39:17.200
Lift me up like Daddy does.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.150
George!

39:52.880 --> 39:54.200
Go to your bed! Go on!

40:50.560 --> 40:52.950
Seeing you makes me happy much.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.590
- That's...
- Is this wrong?

40:55.640 --> 40:57.520
No. No, it's much right.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.670
Just wear the clothes
that Mrs Markham lent you.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.630
Oh, darling, they're a bit...

41:11.680 --> 41:13.180
She'll be offended if you don't.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.480
And you're beautiful whatever you wear.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.800
Alison said she'd help
me out, with everything.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.880
Well, Lieutenant
Laithwaite is a Lieutenant.

41:30.560 --> 41:32.000
He's below me, in rank.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.670
So?

41:34.720 --> 41:38.390
What if I have to order him to do
something he doesn't want to do?

41:38.440 --> 41:41.480
It won't help either of us if my
wife and his wife are friends.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.280
The one you need to win over is Orchover.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.710
Thank you for the advice, Corporal...?

42:14.760 --> 42:16.720
Orchover, sir.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.510
20 years a Corporal -- never
wanted to take his Sergeant's exams.

42:25.560 --> 42:28.880
Normandy, The Rhine, Suez,
Malaya. He's seen it all.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.040
Him and Baxter -- they're the backbone.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.960
And the wives?

42:38.280 --> 42:40.960
Has Laithwaite got his wife under control?

42:42.640 --> 42:46.550
Time to go, sir -- your carriage awaits!

42:46.600 --> 42:51.040
- Sir. - Sir. - Sir.

42:54.680 --> 42:58.310
I hope you were a good boy for
Corporal Stoneham last night?

42:58.360 --> 42:59.600
Daddy?

43:03.280 --> 43:06.230
- Daddy?
- Yes.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.320
I got shot in the head.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.880
Sounds like you had a good time.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.000
A quiet night after all.

43:30.400 --> 43:31.910
None of us should apologise

43:31.960 --> 43:34.270
for what we've given to
those parts of the world

43:34.320 --> 43:35.760
lucky enough to have us.

43:37.720 --> 43:43.680
Once the roads and the schools and
the hospitals are built, we leave.

43:46.120 --> 43:47.880
The British Empire is benevolent.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.110
What's the longest conversation

43:52.160 --> 43:55.190
you've had with anyone
in Aden who was born here?

43:55.240 --> 43:58.190
Have you ever had the
curiosity or the courtesy or

43:58.240 --> 44:00.920
the imagination to ask
anyone if they agree with you?

44:03.080 --> 44:06.830
They hate you, sir, and
everything you stand for.

44:06.880 --> 44:09.430
Me?

44:09.480 --> 44:13.150
It's us, Ed. We wear the same uniform.

44:13.200 --> 44:16.520
We trust one another because
we live by the same rules.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.120
Let's get him the fuck out of here!

44:22.520 --> 44:23.960
Take care, sir.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.920
Alison?

44:53.680 --> 44:54.880
Hello?

44:57.120 --> 45:00.150
♪ Green hills of Tyrol

45:00.200 --> 45:03.350
♪ Because those green hills
are not highland hills

45:03.400 --> 45:05.950
♪ Or the island hills

45:06.000 --> 45:08.390
♪ They're not my land's hills

45:08.440 --> 45:12.150

45:15.320 --> 45:17.270
♪ They're not my land's hills

♪ As fair as these green

♪ They are not the hills of home... ♪

45:51.200 --> 45:57.320
♪ They are not the hills of home! ♪

45:58.680 --> 46:00.760
Thanks, sir.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.590
Sir... scotch.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.680
- Stick 'em on the bonnet. They'll
be dry in two minutes. - Oh...

46:18.360 --> 46:19.270
Drop 'em!

46:20.320 --> 46:21.760
Stop laughing.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.910
And the rest.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.640
All right there, like that?

46:29.000 --> 46:30.750
Sir!

46:30.800 --> 46:31.870
Oi, sir, come...

46:32.920 --> 46:35.510
Sir, come on! Sir...

46:35.560 --> 46:37.870
[Sir, what are you doing?!]

46:37.920 --> 46:39.480
[You look beautiful!]

46:43.800 --> 46:45.830
- Sir, you've got me shorts...
- Come on!

46:45.880 --> 46:47.390
- Hurry up!
- Oh, come on, sir, please!

46:48.940 --> 46:50.870
- Sir, for God's sake!
- Come on!

46:50.920 --> 46:52.430
Come on, please!

46:52.480 --> 46:53.550
Fucking hell.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.040
Sorry, come on.

46:58.160 --> 47:00.480
- Come back, sir!
- Woo-woo-woo! - Sir, come back!

47:56.960 --> 47:58.680
Ah!

48:07.520 --> 48:08.840
Ah, shit.

48:14.280 --> 48:16.160
~

48:18.040 --> 48:22.320
~

48:25.880 --> 48:27.840
~

49:29.680 --> 49:32.960
Squad, stand at ease.

49:34.200 --> 49:36.830
RAF recon are saying...

49:36.880 --> 49:38.320
it's a single Land Rover.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.190
And it's burnt out.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.390
Sir...

49:44.440 --> 49:45.600
is it them?

49:49.040 --> 49:51.680
Captain Page and Lance
Corporal Armstrong...

49:53.080 --> 49:56.470
.. should have been at the
airfield two hours ago.

49:56.520 --> 50:00.470
The more professionalism we
show now, in dealing with this,

50:00.520 --> 50:03.520
the better the chance of us
finding whoever is responsible.

50:05.680 --> 50:08.390
Remember who we are...

50:08.440 --> 50:10.150
and what Lance Corporal Armstrong

50:10.200 --> 50:12.720
and Captain Page would expect from you.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.270
Where are they?

50:55.320 --> 50:58.390
OK, which way did they go?

50:58.440 --> 51:00.230
Look at me! Which way did they go?

51:00.280 --> 51:01.910
Stay where you are.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.790
Tell me everything you
know, everything you saw.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.430
Hands where I can see them.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.950
Tell me what you know!

51:09.000 --> 51:10.720
Look at me, tell me what you know.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.590
The men are finding this hard.

51:15.640 --> 51:19.040
It's pretty vital that we officers
keep our emotions under control.

51:19.260 --> 51:20.710
Right! Come out, come out!

51:20.760 --> 51:22.150
Are there any more men in there?

51:22.200 --> 51:24.270
- ~
- Baxter!

51:24.320 --> 51:26.480
- Sir!
- ~

51:28.720 --> 51:31.070
I need you here.

51:31.120 --> 51:33.310
- Sir!
- They'll be long gone.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.630
With respect, sir, no, they won't, sir.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.780
My guess is they'll still be here,
hiding in amongst the locals.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.670
No Armstrong?

51:41.720 --> 51:43.830
- Sir?
- No remains.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.350
Nothing.

51:45.400 --> 51:46.440
Why not?

51:47.760 --> 51:49.390
- Did he wear dog tags?
- Yes, sir.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.590
So, where are they?

51:51.640 --> 51:53.030
Radio back to base.

51:53.080 --> 51:56.470
- I want a search party out, now!
- Sir! - Sir, I think we should move out.

51:56.520 --> 51:59.080
- We're sitting ducks.
- We're not finished here.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.920
We take our dead with us
and we do it with dignity.

52:07.440 --> 52:10.160
I want them all to know what
the British Army is made of.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.480
Slow.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.160
Slower.

53:30.880 --> 53:32.590
Yusra?

53:32.640 --> 53:34.070
Tony.

53:34.120 --> 53:37.150
- ~
- No...

53:37.200 --> 53:38.560
Shukran, shukran.

54:11.840 --> 54:13.320
Oh...

54:24.680 --> 54:26.280
There, all done.

54:29.160 --> 54:30.240
I'm sorry, I...

54:34.040 --> 54:36.320
Sorry, I can't write this.

54:40.880 --> 54:42.080
Where do they live?

54:43.360 --> 54:45.030
Er, Sancreed.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.440
The toe end of Cornwall.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.360
We've been there.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.630
The sheep in the churchyard,

54:53.680 --> 54:55.000
do you remember?

55:00.320 --> 55:02.560
He was their only son,
Mary. It'll kill them.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.960
Will you help me?

55:15.640 --> 55:18.550
"Dear Mr and Mrs Page..."

Oh, we are!

55:52.440 --> 55:54.750
Oh, we pretend we're not but we are!

55:56.760 --> 55:57.880
Help him up.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.760
Lieutenant!

56:06.320 --> 56:09.110
These are real people.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.470
Some of them are wonderful,
some of them are bastards!

56:11.520 --> 56:13.750
- OK. - Most of them are, you
know, they're just in between,

56:13.800 --> 56:14.910
they're just like us.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.990
But we can't treat people the
same because the rules say.

56:18.040 --> 56:21.080
- Then why the hell were you doing
that to him? - Because he knew.

56:24.400 --> 56:25.600
Because I knew.

56:27.920 --> 56:30.150
I knew.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.480
- I'm sorry.
- Go home.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.640
Have a drink.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.160
Be with your wife.

57:22.280 --> 57:23.880
Armstrong?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.320
Armstrong!

57:36.240 --> 57:37.950
You're late.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.430
Yes, sir.

57:39.480 --> 57:41.110
Sorry, sir.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.760
Very late.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.080
Yes, sir.

57:48.880 --> 57:49.960
Welcome home.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.630
I saw a shooting star.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.630
Death, that's what you're seeing.

58:04.680 --> 58:06.990
The raid party goes in at 1300 hours.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.430
Their objective, to capture one man.

58:09.480 --> 58:10.580
He's brutal, he's clever.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.190
Ambre Solaire, fish and chips, gin.

58:15.240 --> 58:17.110
This is my favourite place in the world.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.270
I'm sorry about Nick Page.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.470
It's even harder...!

58:21.520 --> 58:23.760
There's a reporter coming with us.

58:25.800 --> 58:29.000
I can't make this decision,
choosing between my wife and my men.
