<i>Mr. Fire</i>

<i>For everything people were</i>
<i>making it out to be</i>

00:58.949 --> 01:01.110
<i>you'd think</i>
<i>it was our first fight.</i>

01:02.419 --> 01:03.784
<i>It wasn't.</i>

01:04.388 --> 01:05.878
<i>And it wouldn't be our last.</i>

01:09.460 --> 01:10.950
<i>And, in local news,</i>

01:11.028 --> 01:14.520
<i>violence between servicemen</i>
<i>and zoot-suiters reached</i>
<i>a new level tonight</i>

01:14.598 --> 01:17.863
<i>after the wives of two sailors</i>
<i>were criminally attacked.</i>

01:17.935 --> 01:20.529
<i>An order listing Los Angeles</i>
<i>as a restricted area</i>

01:20.604 --> 01:21.969
<i>has not deterred the fighting,</i>

01:22.039 --> 01:24.633
<i>but the Los Angeles</i>
<i>Police Department</i>
<i>assures the public</i>

01:24.708 --> 01:27.643
<i>that it has the situation</i>
<i>completely under control.</i>

01:28.712 --> 01:31.681
Hey, sawbuck
on the private chasing
that skinny one over there!

01:31.748 --> 01:33.739
Come on, private!

01:33.817 --> 01:35.546
Come on, private!
That spic's quick!

01:35.619 --> 01:36.916
Jesus Christ!

01:36.987 --> 01:39.683
Double or nothing
on that greaser!
You're on!

01:49.199 --> 01:50.632
Bleichert!

01:52.236 --> 01:53.931
<i>I already knew him</i>

01:56.306 --> 01:59.503
<i>A regular attraction</i>

01:59.576 --> 02:01.476
<i>Lee Blanchard.</i>
Bleichert!

02:01.545 --> 02:03.376
<i>43-4-2 as a heavyweight.</i>

02:04.148 --> 02:05.137
Shit!

02:05.215 --> 02:06.512
<i>And he knew me,</i>

02:06.850 --> 02:08.841
<i>Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert.</i>

02:09.520 --> 02:10.748
<i>Light heavy,</i>

02:11.255 --> 02:14.190
<i>36-0-0. Ranked tenth</i>

02:15.559 --> 02:18.528
<i>Fighting no-name opponents</i>

02:25.402 --> 02:26.733
Get out of here!

02:26.803 --> 02:28.498
Hey, get back there.

02:28.572 --> 02:30.699
<i>In our first year</i>
<i>at Central Division Station</i>

02:31.475 --> 02:32.499
<i>we never spoke.</i>

02:32.576 --> 02:34.567
To the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbirds.

02:34.645 --> 02:36.078
Who's this?

02:38.448 --> 02:40.075
Officer Bleichert,

02:41.084 --> 02:43.211
meet <i>Se√±or</i> Tomas Dos Santos.

02:43.353 --> 02:46.618
You came all the way
down here just to roust
some Class B felon?

02:46.690 --> 02:49.887
Came down here, same as you,
to keep from getting killed.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.929
Happened to see some jarheads
beating on a good collar.

02:52.996 --> 02:54.588
I'll take him in the morning.
This is nuts.

02:54.665 --> 02:56.997
We'll never get him
booked tonight.

02:59.303 --> 03:01.066
That's a nice left hook
you got.

03:02.072 --> 03:03.232
Mmm.

03:03.674 --> 03:05.266
Well, you know, old habits.

03:05.876 --> 03:06.968
Yeah.

03:07.544 --> 03:11.036
My girlfriend saw you fight
a couple of times
over at the Olympic.

03:11.114 --> 03:14.015
Said you were good.
Said you were somebody.

03:18.689 --> 03:20.486
Big fish, small pond.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.560
Never made it up to the
big boys' division like you.

03:23.627 --> 03:26.118
My first 20 fights
were stumblebums

03:26.697 --> 03:28.528
handpicked by my manager.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.226
Lucky to survive.

03:31.235 --> 03:33.669
There's a Jew-boy Deputy D.A.
over in Central Warrants,

03:33.737 --> 03:35.170
wets his pants for fighters,

03:35.239 --> 03:37.639
and he promised me
the next spot he can wangle.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.105
<i>Warrants was</i>
<i>local celebrity as a cop.</i>

03:41.178 --> 03:42.975
<i>Warrants was chasing</i>
<i>real criminals</i>

03:43.046 --> 03:45.879
<i>not rousting winos</i>
<i>and wienie waggers in front</i>
<i>of some Midnight Mission.</i>

03:45.949 --> 03:47.439
Hey, Bleichert.
Bleichert.

03:47.517 --> 03:50.145
They want to see you upstairs.
The D.A.'s office.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.586
<i>Jew-boy D.A.s</i>
<i>with hard-ons for fighters.</i>

03:52.656 --> 03:54.783
<i>Transfers, promotions...</i>
Officer Bleichert.

03:54.858 --> 03:56.325
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>I told myself I didn't care.</i>

03:56.393 --> 03:57.951
Gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert.

03:58.028 --> 03:59.757
Bucky,
this is Chief Ted Green.

03:59.830 --> 04:00.819
Nice to meet you.

04:00.897 --> 04:03.263
Deputy District Attorney
Ellis Loew.

04:04.768 --> 04:06.201
Read that out loud, Dwight.

04:06.270 --> 04:08.170
That's running
in the <i>Sunday Times</i>.

04:09.273 --> 04:10.638
"Before the war,
the City of Angels

04:10.707 --> 04:13.107
"was graced
with two local fighters,

04:13.176 --> 04:16.441
"pugilists with styles
as different as fire and ice.

04:16.513 --> 04:18.845
"Lee Blanchard..."

04:19.650 --> 04:20.981
Excuse me.

04:21.251 --> 04:23.310
"Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice
never fought each other

04:23.387 --> 04:25.981
"but duty brought them
to the Los Angeles
Police Department.

04:26.056 --> 04:29.548
"Blanchard cracked
the Boulevard-Citizens
Bank robbery case in 1939

"and captured thrill-killer,
Tomas Dos Santos.

"Bleichert
served with distinction
during the Zoot Suit Wars."

04:35.432 --> 04:37.229
Jump to the end.
Right, boss.

"On Election Day, voters are
going to be asked to vote

"Keep in mind the examples

04:48.412 --> 04:50.607
"Vote 'Yes' on Proposition B."

04:50.781 --> 04:51.975
What do you think?

04:52.649 --> 04:53.673
Subtle.

04:53.750 --> 04:54.774
Prop B's a loser right now,

04:54.851 --> 04:56.216
but I think if we can
drum up some publicity

04:56.286 --> 04:58.846
we can get it passed
in next month's election.

04:58.922 --> 05:00.150
Yes, sir.
Fire and Ice.

05:00.223 --> 05:02.691
Ten rounds, Academy Gym,
three weeks from now,
before the election,

05:02.759 --> 05:03.919
all gate to charity.

05:03.994 --> 05:06.485
After that, we bring back
the boxing team.

05:06.563 --> 05:08.463
What do you say, Bucky?
You in?

05:08.532 --> 05:10.124
I got to
get back in shape.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.258
Bucky.

05:11.335 --> 05:12.529
Lee.

05:12.602 --> 05:14.229
I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

05:14.304 --> 05:16.204
Hello.
Hello.

05:16.273 --> 05:17.501
You beefing up?

05:17.574 --> 05:18.836
You know.

05:18.909 --> 05:21.309
I was just telling Kay here
about our new hobby.

05:21.378 --> 05:22.606
Are you a fight fan,
Miss Lake?

05:22.679 --> 05:24.237
No, Lee used to drag me.

05:24.314 --> 05:26.680
I was taking art classes,
so I'd sketch.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.081
She made me quit fighting
the smokers.

05:28.151 --> 05:29.709
Didn't want me doing
the "Vegetable Shuffle."

05:29.786 --> 05:31.617
I promise not to hurt you.

05:31.688 --> 05:33.280
That won't make Loew
very happy.

05:33.357 --> 05:34.847
Oh, he's got money on me?

05:34.925 --> 05:37.723
Seems that way.
You win, you get Warrants.

05:38.061 --> 05:39.358
What's in it for you?

05:39.429 --> 05:41.590
Well, betting works both ways.

05:41.665 --> 05:43.064
My girl's got a taste
for nice things

05:43.133 --> 05:45.533
and I can't afford to
let her down.

05:45.602 --> 05:46.728
Right, babe?

05:46.803 --> 05:48.828
Keep talking about me
in third person.

05:48.905 --> 05:50.304
It sends me.

05:50.607 --> 05:52.268
What do you think of all this,
Miss Lake?

05:52.342 --> 05:56.676
Well, for civic reasons,
I hope the LAPD is ridiculed
for perpetrating this farce.

05:56.747 --> 05:59.181
For personal reasons,
I hope Lee wins.

05:59.249 --> 06:02.116
And, for esthetic reasons,
I hope you both look good
with your shirts off.

06:21.405 --> 06:22.497
Papa?

06:38.321 --> 06:40.016
<i>Guten Tag</i>, Dwight.

06:40.090 --> 06:41.114
English, Papa.

06:52.669 --> 06:55.467
Hey, you haven't finished
this plane yet.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.969
Can you finish that?

07:00.143 --> 07:01.667
Here, sit down.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.615
If you could just come by
and clean the place up,

07:11.688 --> 07:13.883
keep an eye on him
for a week or so.

07:16.693 --> 07:18.160
I know I still owe you.

07:21.965 --> 07:24.058
Guess what I hear is right.

07:24.868 --> 07:26.460
You'll want to place this
with Mickey Cohen's indie.

07:26.536 --> 07:28.265
He's got Blanchard, 2-1.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.803
That confident, huh?

07:32.876 --> 07:34.776
You done your homework?

07:36.179 --> 07:38.306
Yeah. I've done my homework.

07:43.787 --> 07:45.914
I'm not betting on me, Pete.

07:48.024 --> 07:50.049
Blanchard's the hero here.

07:50.527 --> 07:51.994
That's the way
the story's supposed to go.

07:52.062 --> 07:53.427
I'm just the other guy.

08:02.739 --> 08:05.105
Well, at least he looks good
with his shirt off.

08:09.212 --> 08:11.112
Where's your sketchpad?

08:11.314 --> 08:12.679
I was never any good.

08:12.749 --> 08:15.081
Ended up with a Master's
in History.

08:16.152 --> 08:17.915
Education's
an expensive habit.

08:18.989 --> 08:20.581
Lee paid for it.

08:21.191 --> 08:22.658
He shouldn't have
quit fighting.

08:22.726 --> 08:24.284
I asked him to.

08:24.361 --> 08:27.455
Besides, police work
gives him a sense of order.

08:30.233 --> 08:32.633
Do you have a girlfriend,
Dwight?

08:33.169 --> 08:35.694
I'm saving myself
for Rita Hayworth.

08:41.077 --> 08:43.341
So he quits
fighting for you,
puts you through school.

08:43.413 --> 08:45.745
Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

08:45.949 --> 08:47.849
Why aren't you married?

08:51.154 --> 08:53.315
You know,
shacking's against regs.
Probably cost him a stripe.

08:53.390 --> 08:56.188
So where's the diamonds
and the bassinets, huh?

08:58.128 --> 09:00.688
Well, you'd have
to sleep together
for that, Dwight.

09:13.243 --> 09:15.643
<i>The gym was packed</i>
<i>to the rafters.</i>

09:16.513 --> 09:19.346
<i>A wild crowd hungry</i>
<i>to see what was in us.</i>

09:21.151 --> 09:23.244
<i>I already knew what was in us.</i>

09:23.320 --> 09:25.288
<i>Ambition, pride,</i>

09:25.922 --> 09:28.914
<i>dissatisfaction at a life</i>
<i>turned just the wrong way.</i>

09:28.992 --> 09:30.459
Luck, Dwight.

09:32.028 --> 09:33.791
Come on.

09:45.108 --> 09:46.632
Keep it clean!

10:13.670 --> 10:17.071
<i>I feel it's my duty</i>
<i>as a friend to tell you this,</i>

10:17.674 --> 10:19.574

10:33.023 --> 10:34.251
One!

10:35.025 --> 10:36.083
Two!

10:36.793 --> 10:37.953
Three!

10:38.695 --> 10:39.855
Four!

10:40.597 --> 10:41.689
Five!

10:44.200 --> 10:45.258
Six!

10:45.435 --> 10:47.096
<i>I lost a lot of things</i>
<i>in life...</i>

10:47.170 --> 10:48.501
Seven!

10:49.839 --> 10:51.397
<i>...but never</i>
<i>a fight for money.</i>

10:51.474 --> 10:52.668
Eight!

11:08.858 --> 11:12.385
<i>I was trading Warrants</i>
<i>for a close-out on old</i>
<i>bad debts.</i>

11:13.029 --> 11:14.394
<i>The eight grand</i>
<i>I was going to clear</i>

11:14.464 --> 11:15.692
<i>was enough</i>
<i>to maintain the old man</i>

11:15.765 --> 11:18.666
<i>in a good, clean rest home</i>
<i>for three years.</i>

11:18.902 --> 11:20.164
<i>The late-round tank job,</i>

11:20.236 --> 11:22.363
<i>enough to convince myself</i>
<i>I wasn't a complete coward.</i>

11:23.506 --> 11:24.564
Box!

11:30.146 --> 11:31.773
Finish the fight!

11:32.282 --> 11:33.943
Where's that hook?

12:25.001 --> 12:26.366
You're out!

12:44.654 --> 12:46.246
Give me a smile.

12:57.867 --> 12:59.892
It's nice, isn't it, Papa?

13:00.503 --> 13:02.164
What do you think?

13:21.958 --> 13:23.653
Hey! Canvasback!

13:30.867 --> 13:32.232
Canvasback!

13:38.842 --> 13:41.572
You going to hide in there
another week?

13:41.778 --> 13:43.541
Ain't you bored yet?

13:44.180 --> 13:45.670
Nice chompers.

13:46.149 --> 13:47.844
So, you want to work Warrants?

13:47.917 --> 13:49.578
I lost.
What about Loew's deal?

13:49.652 --> 13:53.019
Don't you read the papers?
The bond passed yesterday.

13:53.857 --> 13:55.085
You want the job?

13:56.826 --> 13:58.555
Atta boy, Mr. Ice.

13:59.996 --> 14:01.156
Champ!

14:02.098 --> 14:03.759
Show them what's
under the lip, boss.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.425
Right over here.

14:05.969 --> 14:09.268
Officer Bleichert,
the men of Central Dicks.

14:09.706 --> 14:13.733
Homicide,
Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera.
I'm Captain John Tierney.

14:14.611 --> 14:16.135
You and Lee
are the white men of the hour,

14:16.212 --> 14:18.112
so I hope
you enjoyed your ovation.

14:18.181 --> 14:20.206
You won't get another one
till you retire.

14:21.851 --> 14:24.012
Enough horse shit!
Listen!

14:24.520 --> 14:26.112
This is the felony
summary report

14:26.189 --> 14:29.249
for the week ending
November 14, 1946.

14:29.325 --> 14:31.657
First, two liquor store
stickups

14:31.895 --> 14:35.194
Broadway and Seventh,
and Hill Liquor in Chinatown.

14:35.465 --> 14:37.126
That one comes
with a pistol whipping,

14:37.267 --> 14:39.132
my personal favorite.

14:39.202 --> 14:40.794
Russ Millard, Homicides.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.565
Hi.
How are you?

14:42.639 --> 14:44.539
My wife and kids thank you
for the raise, Officer.

14:44.607 --> 14:47.337
Officer Bleichert,
I'm Bill Koenig.
This is Fritz Vogel.

14:47.410 --> 14:49.640
Welcome aboard.
Pleasure to meet you.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.978
Lee, I heard something
you ought to know.

14:54.050 --> 14:57.884
I was over at County Parole,
and Bobby DeWitt got
an "A" number.

14:57.954 --> 15:00.184
He'll be released to L.A.
in late January.

15:00.256 --> 15:01.723
Thanks, Russ.

15:05.328 --> 15:06.659
Who's Bobby DeWitt?

15:06.729 --> 15:07.991
Old beef.

15:08.431 --> 15:10.092
Pot roast tonight?

15:22.745 --> 15:24.440
Don't say anything
about DeWitt.

15:24.514 --> 15:25.845
It'll upset Kay.

15:26.549 --> 15:27.641
Sure.

15:35.458 --> 15:36.823
Nice place.

15:36.893 --> 15:38.292
Fight stash.

15:39.595 --> 15:40.755
Hello.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.128
Dwight.
Glad you could make it.

15:44.968 --> 15:46.936
How was your first day?

15:47.971 --> 15:51.338
Mostly backslaps and paperwork
if I know those boys.

15:54.077 --> 15:56.170
And look at that smile now.

16:06.956 --> 16:09.151
Well, this is nice,
isn't it?

16:10.393 --> 16:11.451
What?

16:11.527 --> 16:13.222
You and Lee partners.
It's nice.

16:13.296 --> 16:16.424
It couldn't have worked out
better if you'd planned it,
could it, Dwight?

16:16.499 --> 16:17.761
Well, I could've beat him.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.301
Except you didn't.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.896
I don't know, sweetheart.
Bucky was somebody
back in the day.

16:22.972 --> 16:24.098
And here we all are...

16:24.173 --> 16:25.504
It's nice.

16:25.742 --> 16:26.936
It's more than nice.

16:27.010 --> 16:30.468
Might even be worth those
front teeth of yours, Dwight.

16:31.247 --> 16:32.441
A toast

16:33.416 --> 16:34.474
to Proposition B.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.211
To the Bleichert-Blanchard
rematch,

16:36.285 --> 16:37.843
bigger than
Louis-Schmeling.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.218
To my supercops!

16:40.590 --> 16:41.682
To us!

16:45.395 --> 16:46.760
<i>From November</i>
<i>through the New Year,</i>

16:46.829 --> 16:49.354
<i>Lee and I captured</i>
<i>11 hard felons,</i>

16:49.432 --> 16:53.391
<i>18 traffic warrantees</i>
<i>and three parole</i>
<i>and probation absconders.</i>

16:55.371 --> 16:59.432
<i>After tours of duty,</i>
<i>Lee and I would go</i>
<i>to the house and find Kay.</i>

17:00.143 --> 17:01.974
<i>Sometimes she'd make</i>
<i>dinner for us.</i>

17:02.045 --> 17:05.572
<i>Other times, the three of us</i>
<i>would go out on the town.</i>

17:26.869 --> 17:28.666
<i>Always she'd be there</i>

17:28.871 --> 17:31.567
<i>never between us,</i>
<i>always in the middle.</i>

18:27.363 --> 18:28.796
<i>For New Year's,</i>
<i>we headed downtown</i>

18:28.865 --> 18:31.095
<i>to a dinner club</i>
<i>owned by Morrie Friedman,</i>

18:31.501 --> 18:32.900
<i>a friend of Mickey Cohen's</i>

18:33.169 --> 18:35.364
<i>who sometimes clued</i>
<i>Lee in to L.A. drug traffic.</i>

18:35.438 --> 18:38.032
Happy New Year!

18:59.562 --> 19:01.894
<i>It was the best time</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

19:28.491 --> 19:31.358
Listen up!
Gentlemen, thank you.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.994
"Raymond 'Junior' Nash.

19:33.062 --> 19:36.998
"Statutory rape,
armed robbery, felony mayhem.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.569
"Texas State Prison.
Alcatraz."

19:40.903 --> 19:42.700
Mr. Nash pistol-whipped
a little old lady

19:42.772 --> 19:44.865
at a stickup near
Leimert Park,
Tuesday morning.

19:44.941 --> 19:46.169
She died last night.

19:46.242 --> 19:47.800
Anything common
in the sex beefs?

19:47.877 --> 19:49.742
Negro girls. Young ones.

19:50.246 --> 19:52.646
All the complainants
have been coloreds.

19:52.848 --> 19:55.043
<i>Junior Nash</i>
<i>was an inbred Okie shit-kicker</i>

19:55.117 --> 19:57.585
<i>who came west and took</i>
<i>all us locals for easy marks</i>

19:57.653 --> 20:00.747
<i>just because</i>
<i>we prefer our cowboys</i>
<i>to look like Gene Autry.</i>

20:00.823 --> 20:02.450
<i>Of course, I didn't care</i>
<i>if he was a hard man</i>

20:02.525 --> 20:04.254
<i>or what he thought</i>
<i>about anything.</i>

20:04.327 --> 20:07.296
<i>He raped children and beat</i>
<i>senior citizens to death.</i>

20:07.430 --> 20:10.365
<i>He was a coward</i>
<i>and I wanted to put him down.</i>

20:10.600 --> 20:15.264
I got a tip for the hophead
who's going to be at Norton
and Coliseum tonight.

20:16.005 --> 20:17.165
Hey, partner,
everything good to go?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.264
Yeah.

20:18.341 --> 20:21.572
Nash just got a fuck pad
on Norton and Coliseum.

20:56.712 --> 20:58.373
Scram! Get out of here!

20:58.447 --> 20:59.675
Okay!

20:59.749 --> 21:00.841
Fine.

21:02.685 --> 21:04.812
Don't make me say it twice!
All right! We're going!

21:04.887 --> 21:06.377
Make some money, man.

21:25.574 --> 21:29.476
Oh, my! Oh, help!
Help me! Help, somebody!

21:29.545 --> 21:32.639
Please! Help!
Stop! Stop the car!

21:32.715 --> 21:36.310
Please stop! Stop! Stop!

21:50.399 --> 21:52.731
Listen. I'm broke.

21:53.769 --> 21:55.760
Baby,
he's gonna cut us
a real good deal on this.

21:55.838 --> 21:57.669
I have been knowing him
for a long time.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.674
You ain't got to worry
about a thing, okay?

21:59.742 --> 22:02.210
You ain't got to worry.
I got this dirty cop.

22:02.278 --> 22:03.472
Mmm-hmm.

22:03.846 --> 22:05.609
He's going to
take care of me real soon.

22:05.681 --> 22:06.705
And I mean real soon.

22:06.782 --> 22:08.147
Dirty cop?

22:09.051 --> 22:11.679
I haven't heard
of a clean cop, Baxter.

22:11.754 --> 22:13.722
I just want to go home.
Why do you do this to me, huh?

22:13.789 --> 22:15.654
Why? Why this? Why? Why?

22:15.725 --> 22:18.455
Same reason
why you do this to me.
You know why I do this to you.

22:18.527 --> 22:20.825
Where is this guy?
He's right there.
We almost there. Come on.

22:20.896 --> 22:22.454
Come on, baby! Come on.

22:22.531 --> 22:23.896
Oh, God,
I got to follow you now?

22:23.966 --> 22:25.433
Come on.

22:26.602 --> 22:28.900
Listen, this is the last time.

22:29.105 --> 22:30.629
Bucky, wake up.

22:38.514 --> 22:40.846
Bucky, look out! Get down!

22:41.584 --> 22:45.213
<i>I was half-asleep,</i>
<i>but Lee had his boxer's wits</i>
<i>about him.</i>

22:46.222 --> 22:48.213
<i>He felt the blow coming.</i>

22:49.558 --> 22:51.219
<i>He saved my life.</i>

23:16.051 --> 23:18.281
Get your motherfucking
hands off me, man.
I ain't done nothing!

23:18.354 --> 23:20.481
Yeah, what do you call that
shooting gallery back there?

23:24.894 --> 23:26.225
Fuck you, man!

23:53.689 --> 23:54.747
Lee!

23:58.060 --> 23:59.118
Lee!

24:05.468 --> 24:07.333
Well, that's about it.

24:08.070 --> 24:12.063
Thank you
for your time, Detective,
and for the good police work.

24:12.608 --> 24:14.667
Blanchard knew the white guy,
I guess.

24:14.743 --> 24:16.176
Busted him once.

24:16.645 --> 24:18.636
He snitched for Lee
a couple of times.

24:19.648 --> 24:21.115
Baxter Fitch.

24:22.117 --> 24:24.244
It's a busy neighborhood.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.413
Take a look at top billing.

24:44.974 --> 24:47.738
All right, easy.
Guys, guys. Please.

24:49.111 --> 24:52.012
Don't trample over everything,
please. Easy.

24:52.715 --> 24:54.205
Secure the area.

24:54.283 --> 24:57.411
All right, listen up.
No reporters view the body.

24:57.486 --> 24:59.545
You photo men, finish
taking your pictures now.

24:59.622 --> 25:02.682
Coroner's men,
put a sheet on the body
as soon as they are done.

25:02.758 --> 25:04.692
We set up a perimeter
six feet back.

25:04.760 --> 25:07.320
Any reporter crosses it,
arrest him.

25:07.396 --> 25:09.956
Now, gentlemen, before
this gets out of hand,

25:10.032 --> 25:12.091
let's put the kibosh
on something.

25:12.868 --> 25:14.927
With publicity,
you get confessions.

25:15.004 --> 25:17.802
With confessions,
you get crazies,
liars and false leads.

25:17.873 --> 25:20.273
So, we keep some things quiet.

25:20.576 --> 25:23.875
The ear-to-ear
facial lacerations,

25:24.213 --> 25:25.703
disembowelment,

25:25.781 --> 25:28.443
you keep this information
to yourselves.

25:28.517 --> 25:30.883
Not your wives,
not your girlfriends,

25:30.953 --> 25:33.513
no other officers,
and I mean no...

25:34.023 --> 25:35.957
Bleichert, what the hell
are you doing here?

25:36.025 --> 25:37.185
Where the hell's Blanchard?

25:37.259 --> 25:38.624
He's right here.

25:39.361 --> 25:41.795
Nash might be renting a room
in that building over there.

25:41.864 --> 25:43.661
I heard something
on the radio about
a shooting.

25:43.732 --> 25:44.960
Was that Nash?
No.

25:46.569 --> 25:48.059
We had some trouble.

25:52.274 --> 25:54.242
Stand back!
Get back of the line!

25:54.310 --> 25:55.971
Move back. Come on, boys.

25:56.045 --> 25:57.535
Get them back!

25:59.915 --> 26:02.042
Hey, Raymond Nash, remember?

26:02.685 --> 26:04.277
We need to go
check out that room.

26:04.353 --> 26:05.650
Nash didn't do this.

26:06.221 --> 26:08.951
No. But he beat
a woman to death.

26:09.024 --> 26:10.753
That's why
he's our priority warrantee.

26:14.730 --> 26:18.826
All right!
I need everybody right now!

26:20.536 --> 26:21.594
Baby.

26:27.009 --> 26:28.135
What happened?

26:28.210 --> 26:29.541
Nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.

26:29.612 --> 26:34.015
Lee, Baxter Fitch just
happened to be there?
What happened, Lee?

26:38.354 --> 26:39.446
What do you know about it?

26:39.521 --> 26:42.081
I know you, Lee.
I know you, Lee.

26:45.761 --> 26:46.819
Lee...

26:46.895 --> 26:49.125
He knew one of the guys, so...

26:52.768 --> 26:54.861
Dwight, was it you or them?

26:58.874 --> 27:00.501
He saved my life.

27:05.481 --> 27:07.676
Hey, Kay,
who's Bobby DeWitt?

27:09.585 --> 27:11.348
I know he's an old beef
of Lee's.

27:12.788 --> 27:15.757
But he doesn't
want to talk about it
and he gets out in a week.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.756
You know who he is?

27:30.806 --> 27:32.535
I'm scared, Dwight.

27:35.911 --> 27:37.708
I'll take care of it.

27:40.215 --> 27:42.012
You don't know Bobby.

28:33.669 --> 28:35.136
<i>Bobby DeWitt.</i>

28:36.271 --> 28:38.865
<i>Who are these men</i>
<i>who feed on others?</i>

28:39.842 --> 28:44.108
<i>What do they feel</i>
<i>when they cut their names</i>
<i>into somebody else's life?</i>

28:51.019 --> 28:53.681
<i>It was the case</i>
<i>that made Lee's career.</i>

28:53.756 --> 28:57.055
<i>He'd never said a word</i>
<i>about it and I'd never asked.</i>

28:57.126 --> 28:59.959
<i>One of Lee's snitches</i>
<i>fingered Bobby DeWitt,</i>

29:00.162 --> 29:03.893
<i>a small-time pimp</i>
<i>with a yard-long rap,</i>
<i>as the brains behind the job.</i>

29:03.966 --> 29:07.129
<i>DeWitt never</i>
<i>spoke the entire trial,</i>
<i>never coughing up the dough</i>

29:07.202 --> 29:10.467
<i>even after damning</i>
<i>character testimony</i>
<i>from some of his girls</i>

29:10.539 --> 29:12.302
<i>including one Katherine Lake,</i>

29:13.208 --> 29:14.835
<i>formerly of Sioux Falls,</i>
<i>South Dakota,</i>

29:14.910 --> 29:16.673
<i>and looking to go straight.</i>

29:17.713 --> 29:20.307
<i>DeWitt got 10 to life</i>
<i>in San Quentin.</i>

29:20.415 --> 29:21.780
<i>Lee got Kay</i>

29:22.851 --> 29:25.445
<i>or maybe it was</i>
<i>the other way around.</i>

29:31.794 --> 29:34.422
We're supposed to be
looking for Nash.

29:34.496 --> 29:35.758
Priority.

29:36.298 --> 29:38.357
Yeah, priority
for Homicide Division, not us.

29:38.433 --> 29:40.628
Nice white girl gets snuffed.

29:40.936 --> 29:43.598
Got to show the voters
they did the right thing
passing the bond issue.

29:43.672 --> 29:46.300
It's A-plus, Buck.
We don't miss this.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.344
Maybe she wasn't
such a nice girl.

29:50.612 --> 29:54.742
Maybe that old lady
that Nash snuffed was
somebody's loving granny.

29:56.785 --> 29:58.184
Maybe we let
the Bureau handle this

29:58.253 --> 30:01.984
and we get back to our job
before Nash snuffs
somebody else.

30:04.226 --> 30:06.023
Got any other maybes?

30:07.062 --> 30:09.758
Yeah, maybe we've had
enough headlines.

30:10.332 --> 30:12.357
With or without you, Buck.

30:15.037 --> 30:16.129
With or without you.

30:16.805 --> 30:19.603
Therefore, we have created
a special unit

30:19.808 --> 30:22.072
which will include a number
of highly trained officers

30:22.144 --> 30:24.135
including
Detective Russell Millard,

30:24.213 --> 30:26.272
our very own Mr. Fire

30:26.515 --> 30:28.506
and his partner, Mr. Ice.

30:28.617 --> 30:31.586
Mr. Loew, can you assure
the public that you will find

30:31.653 --> 30:33.416
the murderer
before he strikes again?

30:33.488 --> 30:35.080
I can guarantee you

30:35.157 --> 30:38.217
this killer will be caught.

30:39.494 --> 30:41.587
You got us detached?
Slow and easy, Buck.

30:41.663 --> 30:45.030
I gave Loew a memo saying
Nash blew our jurisdiction.

30:45.434 --> 30:46.901
You did what?

30:47.469 --> 30:49.130
Are you fucking nuts?
It's all right.

30:49.204 --> 30:51.297
The APB still stands.
He's covered.

30:51.373 --> 30:52.499
This is the main event.

30:52.574 --> 30:55.236
Nash is pure undercard.
Just give me another week
with this girl.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.505
What's your problem
with this?

30:57.579 --> 30:59.240
Letting Nash slip.

31:04.286 --> 31:08.848
On gross pathology,
we have a female Caucasian
between 16 and 30.

31:08.924 --> 31:11.222
The cadaver
is presented in two halves

31:11.293 --> 31:13.955
with bisection
level with the umbilicus.

31:14.897 --> 31:18.094
Through and through
lacerations
of both mouth corners.

31:18.166 --> 31:21.158
No visible bruising
on the neck.

31:21.670 --> 31:25.629
Rectangular abrasions
on the wing tips
of the sphenoid bones.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.977
And, oh!
A puncture wound, here,

31:31.079 --> 31:33.946
in the palm.
On the palm of the right hand.

31:34.583 --> 31:35.743
There.

31:36.151 --> 31:41.054
Investigation of upper half
abdominal cavity reveals
no free-flowing blood.

31:41.723 --> 31:45.716
Intestines, stomach,
spleen, liver, all removed.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.957
Is it all right to smoke,
Doctor?

31:49.031 --> 31:50.498
She won't mind.

31:50.565 --> 31:55.161
Lower half of cadaver
reveals removal
of all reproductive organs.

31:55.370 --> 31:57.099
Both legs broken at the knee.

31:57.172 --> 31:58.503
Questions.

31:58.740 --> 32:01.174
What's your best guess?
Well, here's what she wasn't,

32:01.243 --> 32:03.040
she wasn't raped
and she wasn't pregnant.

32:03.111 --> 32:04.544
In terms of the nitty-gritty,

32:04.613 --> 32:08.014
the cause of death
is either the mouth wound here

32:08.283 --> 32:11.548
or she was beaten to death
with something like
a baseball bat.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.882
What about her insides?

32:12.955 --> 32:15.014
They came out posthumously.

32:15.090 --> 32:17.991
I say then he drained
the blood from the body

32:18.060 --> 32:20.528
and washed it clean,
probably in a bathtub.

32:20.595 --> 32:22.563
Have you got a name yet?

32:22.965 --> 32:24.762
"Elizabeth Ann Short.

32:26.001 --> 32:28.902
"Date of birth,
July 29, 1924,

32:28.971 --> 32:30.336
"Medford, Massachusetts."

32:30.839 --> 32:33.205
Cops popped her in '43.
Santa Barbara.

32:33.275 --> 32:34.799
Underage drinking.

32:34.876 --> 32:37.071
Other than that, she's clean.

32:37.145 --> 32:39.875
Four sisters,
parents divorced,
her father's here in L.A.

32:39.948 --> 32:43.213
Oh, and I hear he sold
some old photos of her
to the <i>Herald</i>.

32:43.552 --> 32:46.817
I got an alibi just in case
you think I did it.

32:47.022 --> 32:50.116
Tighter than a crab's ass,
and that is airtight.

32:51.426 --> 32:52.984
Detective Bleichert,
Mr. Short.

32:53.061 --> 32:54.392
This is Detective Blanchard.

32:54.463 --> 32:57.125
We would like to
express our condolences
for the loss of your daughter.

32:57.199 --> 32:59.190
Yeah, I know who you are.

32:59.634 --> 33:02.728
Neither of you'd have lasted
a round against Jim Jeffries.

33:02.804 --> 33:05.637
And as for Betty,
she called the tune,
she paid the piper.

33:05.707 --> 33:06.901
You want to hear my alibi?

33:06.975 --> 33:08.806
Yeah, since you're
so anxious to tell it.

33:08.877 --> 33:11.107
Johnny on the spot
here at the diner.

33:11.179 --> 33:13.647
Twenty-seven straight hours
at that grill.

33:13.715 --> 33:16.013
Twenty-seven straight,
last 17 overtime.

33:16.084 --> 33:17.346
You ask anybody here.

33:17.419 --> 33:19.751
They'll alibi me up
tighter than a popcorn fart

33:19.821 --> 33:20.845
and that's
pretty fucking tight.

33:20.922 --> 33:23.220
When was the last time
you saw your daughter,
Mr. Short?

33:23.291 --> 33:26.089
Betty came west in '43,
stars in her eyes.

33:26.762 --> 33:29.595
I promised her three squares
and a five-spot,
she kept the house tidy.

33:29.664 --> 33:30.824
She live with you then?

33:30.899 --> 33:32.696
I gave her the boot in July.

33:33.168 --> 33:36.433
Moved to Santa Barbara.
Sent me a postcard
a couple weeks later.

33:36.505 --> 33:38.132
Some soldier
beat her up pretty bad.

33:38.206 --> 33:39.867
That's the last
I heard from her.

33:39.941 --> 33:41.533
I need three pigs
in a blanket.

33:41.610 --> 33:43.976
Keep your fucking panties on.

33:44.046 --> 33:46.139
Was that soldier
her boyfriend, Mr. Short?

33:46.214 --> 33:48.842
Boyfriend?
They were all her boyfriends.

33:49.251 --> 33:51.549
As long as they wore
a uniform.

33:51.953 --> 33:54.478
See, Betty believed in
quantity before quality.

33:54.556 --> 33:55.955
You calling your
own daughter a tramp?

33:56.024 --> 33:57.685
I got five daughters.

33:57.759 --> 33:59.852
One rotten apple ain't so bad.

33:59.928 --> 34:02.726
Well, maybe this time
she had a boyfriend.

34:02.831 --> 34:03.991
Maybe.

34:04.132 --> 34:05.360
Any names, Mr. Short?

34:05.434 --> 34:08.164
Look, Tom, Dick, Harry,
it don't matter.

34:12.441 --> 34:15.171
She said she was looking
for movie work,

34:16.678 --> 34:18.339
but she just paraded
Hollywood Boulevard

34:18.413 --> 34:20.210
in those black get-ups
of hers.

34:21.450 --> 34:24.544
I mean, who wouldn't get
herself killed doing that,
huh?

34:25.220 --> 34:26.687
Who wouldn't?

34:32.928 --> 34:36.659
We just got handed the entire
U.S. armed forces as suspects.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.161
Flip to see
who writes it up?

34:39.234 --> 34:41.395
I'm staking
Nash's pad tonight.

34:41.470 --> 34:44.997
See if we get any strange
drive-bys at the murder scene.

34:45.273 --> 34:48.242
Do me a favor. Stop by
and check on Kay, will you?

34:48.310 --> 34:49.675
Yeah, sure.

34:53.181 --> 34:54.671
Hello, Dwight.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.919
How'd you know it was me?

34:58.987 --> 35:00.352
Lee stomps.

35:02.457 --> 35:04.220
Is Lee working late?
Mmm.

35:05.694 --> 35:07.161
What's wrong?

35:09.598 --> 35:11.793
He's all bent out of shape
on this dead girl.

35:14.269 --> 35:16.134
He's going
a little squirrelly.

35:16.204 --> 35:17.967
Benzedrine, I think.

35:22.310 --> 35:24.278
Did you read the papers?

35:24.379 --> 35:28.338
She's being played up
as the hottest number
since the atom bomb.

35:28.717 --> 35:32.551
Ellis Loew's looking
to make a career on it.
I think Lee's not far behind.

35:32.621 --> 35:34.145
What about you?

35:35.090 --> 35:36.580
What about me?

35:37.993 --> 35:40.587
What's going to happen to us,
Dwight?

35:46.334 --> 35:48.700
The three of us, I don't know.
No, us.

35:49.237 --> 35:50.966
Just the two of us.

36:02.984 --> 36:04.008
Us.

36:09.658 --> 36:10.682
Kay,

36:16.231 --> 36:18.199
there is no two of us.

36:22.170 --> 36:23.762
He's my partner.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.240
And that's everything.

36:29.544 --> 36:31.444
He's done a lot for me.

36:33.515 --> 36:35.608
He's done even more for me.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.686
There's food in the fridge.

36:47.062 --> 36:48.427
Good night.

37:27.068 --> 37:29.969
Thank our friend Bevo Means
at the <i>Examiner</i>.

37:30.171 --> 37:33.299
See, Bevo's painting
Betty in a black dress
like some actress

37:33.375 --> 37:36.435
in that Alan Ladd movie,
<i>Blue Dahlia.</i>

37:36.544 --> 37:38.011
Should triple our confessions.

37:38.079 --> 37:39.103
Great.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.239
Hollywood will fuck you
when no one else will.

37:41.316 --> 37:43.511
Hey, Johnson,
go get a smoke.

37:46.755 --> 37:48.620
What do you want to do?
I want to go back to Warrants.

37:48.690 --> 37:49.679
No dice.

37:49.758 --> 37:52.352
You're a bright penny,
Bleichert,
and I need you here.

37:54.029 --> 37:56.964
These are Betty's last known
residences and associates.

37:57.032 --> 37:59.660
You go to University Station,
pick up Bill Koenig.
Fritzie's sick.

37:59.734 --> 38:00.996
Lieutenant...

38:01.069 --> 38:02.366
No. You call me Russ

38:02.637 --> 38:03.934
and you get out of here.

38:08.610 --> 38:10.305
So, how do you want
to play this, Sarge?

38:10.378 --> 38:12.676
Fritzie usually does
the talking.

38:12.747 --> 38:14.112
Muscle job?

38:15.250 --> 38:18.048
Why don't you let me
try and talk to her?

38:25.226 --> 38:27.251
All right, first question,

38:29.998 --> 38:32.193
does a Lorna Mertz
live here?

38:32.801 --> 38:34.200
She used to.

38:34.836 --> 38:36.667
She skipped town this morning.

38:36.738 --> 38:40.265
But I'm holding this suitcase
till she ponies up
the back rent.

38:40.342 --> 38:41.707
Is this it?

38:50.218 --> 38:52.311
Miss Short moved around
quite a bit, too, didn't she?

38:52.387 --> 38:53.479
Was anybody threatening her?

38:53.555 --> 38:54.715
Poor Betty.

38:54.789 --> 38:56.450
Her problem wasn't
too many enemies.

38:56.524 --> 38:58.014
It was too many friends.

38:58.660 --> 39:00.252
I gathered that.

39:01.029 --> 39:02.496
Okay,
let's change the subject.

39:02.564 --> 39:03.656
All right.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.132
How about the world
of high finance?

39:06.201 --> 39:07.395
How about the movies?

39:07.469 --> 39:09.767
You girls are all trying
to break in, right?

39:10.338 --> 39:12.203
Darling, I'm in.

39:12.574 --> 39:14.974
Congratulations.
How about Betty?

39:16.144 --> 39:17.509
Maybe once.

39:18.012 --> 39:19.639
Maybe not at all.

39:20.615 --> 39:22.139
She came around
last Christmas,

39:22.217 --> 39:24.208
bragging about
getting her big break.

39:24.652 --> 39:28.315
Guess after all
those screen tests,
she finally got a part.

39:28.390 --> 39:29.414
But,

39:29.958 --> 39:33.416
she had a tendency to...

39:33.661 --> 39:34.889
Stretch the truth?

39:34.963 --> 39:36.225
No.

39:36.431 --> 39:38.058
She fucking lied.

39:39.868 --> 39:42.234
Do you know the names
of any of her boyfriends?

39:49.077 --> 39:51.204
What is it?
You can tell me.

39:53.081 --> 39:54.139
Well,

39:54.716 --> 39:56.980
I do remember,
before she split,

39:57.051 --> 39:58.211
her and Lorna...

39:58.286 --> 39:59.446
Mertz?

40:00.021 --> 40:02.046
Yeah. Her and Lorna Mertz.

40:03.191 --> 40:06.160
I mean I don't want to
tell any tales out of school

40:06.628 --> 40:09.563
but I do remember them being
up on Hollywood Boulevard

40:09.631 --> 40:11.826
speaking to this older woman.

40:12.167 --> 40:13.361
And she,

40:13.668 --> 40:17.365
she was wearing a man's suit
and had a man's short haircut.

40:18.573 --> 40:20.598
But it was just that once.

40:23.044 --> 40:26.138
Miss Saddon,
are you saying they
were talking to a lesbian?

40:36.090 --> 40:37.580
Your driver's here.

40:37.659 --> 40:39.320
Yeah. I got to go.

40:43.932 --> 40:45.126
We're not done yet.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.134
Well, then,
how about you arrest me?

40:47.202 --> 40:48.567
Because the truck don't wait!

40:48.636 --> 40:52.970
Why don't we take
a look inside Lorna's bag,
and then maybe you can go.

41:02.050 --> 41:03.415
That's her.

41:04.052 --> 41:05.679
Christ, she's 15.

41:06.621 --> 41:09.419
Do you know what studios
Betty tested at?

41:10.658 --> 41:12.819
They weren't exactly studios.

41:12.894 --> 41:14.885
<i>Screen test,</i>
<i>Elizabeth Short.</i>

41:15.797 --> 41:16.957
<i>So, where are you from?</i>

41:17.031 --> 41:18.123
<i>Boston.</i>

41:18.633 --> 41:19.895
<i>How long you've lived here?</i>

41:19.968 --> 41:21.026
<i>Two years.</i>

41:21.102 --> 41:22.865
<i>Lost your accent.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:22.937 --> 41:26.065
<i>You know, when in Rome. Why?</i>
<i>Are you looking for a girl</i>
<i>with an accent?</i>

41:26.140 --> 41:27.368
<i>No, no. That's all right.</i>

41:27.442 --> 41:29.569
<i>Because I can just bring it</i>
<i>back like that.</i>

41:29.644 --> 41:33.011
<i>Because I'm a whiz</i>
<i>with accents and I basically</i>
<i>do every accent in the world.</i>

41:33.081 --> 41:35.641
<i>We don't really need</i>
<i>an accent, thank you.</i>

41:35.717 --> 41:37.617
<i>'Cause I can be</i>
<i>from anywhere.</i>

41:38.553 --> 41:39.645
<i>Okay.</i>

41:40.355 --> 41:41.583
<i>Let's hear</i>
<i>that Boston accent.</i>

41:41.656 --> 41:43.180
<i>Now?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

41:43.258 --> 41:45.123
<i>No, I can't do it now.</i>

41:45.326 --> 41:48.784
<i>I would have to meet with</i>
<i>my dialect coach, Milton Perl,</i>

41:49.764 --> 41:52.597
<i>who was introduced to me</i>
<i>by David Selznick.</i>

41:53.167 --> 41:54.600
<i>You know</i>
<i>David O. Selznick?</i>

41:54.669 --> 41:55.795
<i>I do.</i>

41:55.870 --> 41:58.134
<i>He's been very,</i>
<i>very, very kind to me.</i>

41:58.206 --> 42:01.300
<i>He's taken me out</i>
<i>to such beautiful dinners</i>

42:01.376 --> 42:02.707
<i>in fancy restaurants.</i>

42:03.111 --> 42:05.306
<i>And he's treated me</i>
<i>like a lady</i>

42:05.380 --> 42:06.972
<i>and with respect</i>

42:07.048 --> 42:08.572
<i>and guess what.</i>

42:09.117 --> 42:10.744
<i>He was very, very,</i>
<i>very impressed</i>

42:10.818 --> 42:12.979
<i>when I did my Scarlett</i>
<i>for him.</i>

42:13.054 --> 42:15.284
<i>You auditioned for</i>
<i>Scarlett O'Hara?</i>

42:15.356 --> 42:19.258
<i>No, I didn't audition for</i>
Gone With The Wind,
<i>but, the thing is...</i>

42:20.061 --> 42:22.586
<i>Gosh, I just love that movie</i>
<i>so much</i>

42:22.864 --> 42:27.324
<i>that I decided</i>
<i>that I had to memorize</i>
<i>all of Scarlett's dialog.</i>

42:28.803 --> 42:29.861
<i>Well...</i>

42:30.638 --> 42:31.866
<i>And I want to do it for you</i>

42:31.940 --> 42:33.373
<i>because I think</i>
<i>you're handsome.</i>

42:33.441 --> 42:35.636
<i>No, no, I don't think</i>
<i>we need that...</i>
<i>But I think you're handsome</i>

42:35.710 --> 42:38.178

42:39.180 --> 42:40.977

42:56.564 --> 42:58.429

43:08.242 --> 43:10.437
<i>"I'll never go hungry again."</i>

43:13.014 --> 43:14.481
He hated her.

43:14.849 --> 43:17.841
Bad, and he wanted
the whole world to know it.

43:18.386 --> 43:19.819
Lee, you got to eat something.

43:19.887 --> 43:22.378
Get this off the table!
God damn it!

43:23.157 --> 43:25.284
Dwight,
you got to do something.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.793
He's been like this
since last night.

43:26.861 --> 43:28.761
Get some air.
I'll take care of him.

43:28.830 --> 43:31.128
Bucky,
this ain't a random job.

43:31.299 --> 43:34.029
He knew what he was doing
every single step of the way.

43:38.506 --> 43:41.236
You learn anything
about our girl today?

43:42.744 --> 43:44.507
Nothing worth
you doing this to yourself.

43:44.579 --> 43:46.604
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No, I'm staying here with her.

43:46.681 --> 43:47.841
Come on.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.581
Go learn something
about our girl!

44:00.161 --> 44:03.392
<i>Love</i>

44:04.499 --> 44:06.899
<i>For sale</i>

44:09.671 --> 44:14.870
<i>Advertising young love</i>
<i>for sale</i>

44:14.942 --> 44:16.569
Beverage Control?

44:17.178 --> 44:18.440
LAPD Homicide.

44:19.013 --> 44:20.708
Who got snuffed?

44:21.816 --> 44:23.681
Seen either of them?

44:23.751 --> 44:25.616
The Dahlia's a sister?

44:25.887 --> 44:27.787
I don't know. You tell me.

44:27.855 --> 44:29.152
Never seen her
except in the papers.

44:29.223 --> 44:31.987
And the schoolgirl twist,
I've never seen.

44:32.060 --> 44:35.325
We don't truck
with underage stuff, <i>capisci</i>?

44:36.664 --> 44:38.495
Never seen her, man.

44:39.133 --> 44:40.828
Don't fucking lie to me.

44:41.102 --> 44:43.195
She's 15 fucking years old.

44:43.271 --> 44:45.136
Come clean or I'll slap
a contributing beef on you

44:45.206 --> 44:46.605
and you'll spend
the next five years

44:46.674 --> 44:49.575
serving raisinjack
to bull dykes in Tehachapi.

44:49.644 --> 44:53.205
A couple of times.
Two or three months ago.

44:53.314 --> 44:55.475
She used to get drinks
off the sisters,

44:55.550 --> 44:58.849
though, she liked boys.
I'm sure, man.

44:59.287 --> 45:01.221
Not the Dahlia. Never.

45:02.390 --> 45:06.918

45:41.763 --> 45:44.197
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm sorry.

45:44.265 --> 45:46.665
I was wondering
if you've seen this girl.

45:47.368 --> 45:48.426
Have you?

45:48.503 --> 45:49.629
No.

45:49.704 --> 45:55.370

45:55.443 --> 45:56.910

No!

47:15.289 --> 47:16.313
It is insane!

47:16.390 --> 47:19.154
After everything
that's happened to us, Lee.
I will nail this guy, Kay!

47:19.227 --> 47:21.457
I'll do this,
I will do this!

47:27.168 --> 47:29.693
Talk to her, Bucky.
Reason with her.

47:33.708 --> 47:34.868
Jesus.

47:37.578 --> 47:39.205
Lee, she's right.

47:40.414 --> 47:41.847
There's at least
three misdemeanors here.

47:41.916 --> 47:42.905
You can't...

47:52.860 --> 47:54.987
I promised him a week on this.
Four more days, and it's over.

47:55.062 --> 47:58.122
Dwight, you can be
so gutless sometimes,
you know that?

48:01.102 --> 48:03.036
<i>Three days</i>
<i>since we killed four men.</i>

48:03.104 --> 48:05.538
<i>Three days</i>
<i>until Bobby DeWitt got out.</i>

48:05.606 --> 48:09.508
<i>I tried to tell myself</i>
<i>I was the sturdy leg</i>
<i>in our little triangle.</i>

48:09.577 --> 48:11.067
<i>I was worried it was true.</i>

48:44.078 --> 48:46.046
Slumming, Miss Linscott?

48:48.449 --> 48:49.711
I am now.

48:50.384 --> 48:52.375
Daddy spying on me again?

48:53.854 --> 48:56.254
"Maddy, girl,
you shouldn't
be congregating

48:56.324 --> 48:58.451
"in such unsuitable places."

48:58.526 --> 49:00.118
I'm a policeman.

49:02.263 --> 49:03.890
That's a new one.

49:05.933 --> 49:07.195
Homicide.

49:07.835 --> 49:09.632
Let's try Elizabeth Short
and Lorna Mertz.

49:09.704 --> 49:11.569
I know you knew them,
so don't jerk me off.

49:11.639 --> 49:15.075
Otherwise, it's downtown
and a whole lot of publicity.

49:26.187 --> 49:27.950
This is all a fluke.

49:28.055 --> 49:30.250
I met them at LaVerne's
last fall.

49:30.324 --> 49:33.020
Betty, maybe one time.
Lorna, a couple.

49:33.127 --> 49:36.585
They'd come in
to cadge a drink
or a meal off a sister.

49:37.565 --> 49:39.863
So why'd you rabbit
last night?

49:40.001 --> 49:42.595
Mister,
my father is Emmett Linscott.

49:45.039 --> 49:46.802
The Emmett Linscott?

49:47.241 --> 49:49.607
He built half of Hollywood
and Long Beach.

49:49.677 --> 49:51.542
Imagine the headlines,

49:52.546 --> 49:56.107
"Construction Tycoon's
Daughter Questioned
in Dahlia Case.

49:56.183 --> 49:57.775
"Footsie
at Lesbian Nightclub."

49:57.852 --> 49:59.080
Get the picture?

49:59.153 --> 50:00.643
Technicolor.

50:01.622 --> 50:03.613
So what'd you talk about?

50:04.859 --> 50:05.917
When?

50:05.993 --> 50:07.688
When you were playing footsie.

50:11.866 --> 50:16.701
Lorna talked about her stupid
boyfriend back in Hicktown,
Nebraska, or wherever.

50:17.538 --> 50:20.564
Betty talked about the latest
issue of <i>Screen World</i>.

50:21.675 --> 50:25.076
Starlets, Hollywood dreams,
the whole sad nine yards.

50:25.546 --> 50:28.276
So, did Betty ever tell you
about a movie she was in?

50:28.349 --> 50:31.841
On a conversational level,
they were right up there
with you.

50:31.919 --> 50:33.944
Cute. Answer the question.

50:35.222 --> 50:38.680
Look, I'm tired.
Do you want my alibi
so I can go home?

50:39.927 --> 50:41.019
Sure.

50:41.562 --> 50:46.499
My family and I were in Laguna
from Sunday through Thursday,
along with the servants.

50:46.567 --> 50:48.228
If you want verification,
call Daddy,

50:48.302 --> 50:50.395
but please be discreet.

50:56.977 --> 50:57.966
So,

51:00.047 --> 51:02.880
what do I have to do to keep
my name out of the papers?

51:02.950 --> 51:04.577
What do you mean?

51:05.786 --> 51:07.879
That's not very convincing.

51:09.457 --> 51:12.426
I don't need
your Daddy's money,
if that's what you're saying.

51:12.493 --> 51:14.620
You know it's not
what I'm saying.

51:18.265 --> 51:19.789
I might be convinced.

51:22.002 --> 51:23.799
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

51:24.238 --> 51:27.139
My address is 482
South Muirfield,
Hancock Park.

51:27.208 --> 51:28.641
I know the address.

51:28.709 --> 51:30.108
Not surprised.

51:30.244 --> 51:31.336
Pick me up.

51:31.412 --> 51:33.903
Like a gentleman,
not like a cop.

51:34.949 --> 51:36.644
Oh, one more thing.

51:36.851 --> 51:38.011
What's your name?

51:38.085 --> 51:39.279
Bucky Bleichert.

51:39.353 --> 51:40.342
Bucky?

51:42.189 --> 51:43.781
I'll try to remember.

51:44.592 --> 51:46.583
I can hear you just fine.

51:49.697 --> 51:52.860
Look, ma'am, you mind?
I've just learned to type.

51:53.234 --> 51:56.294
Yes, I understand.
A werewolf and Red Sheridan.

51:58.139 --> 52:00.733
What if the werewolf
is Red Sheridan?

52:01.575 --> 52:04.009
Yes, that would be
more efficient.

52:06.680 --> 52:08.272
I love tip duty.

52:09.283 --> 52:10.545
How's Kay?

52:10.684 --> 52:11.946
Not good.

52:12.353 --> 52:15.982
You mind if I bunk out
at your pop's place
for a few days?

52:16.323 --> 52:17.517
Sure.

52:17.591 --> 52:19.081
Thanks.

52:27.835 --> 52:29.063
DeWitt gets out tomorrow,
Lee.

52:29.136 --> 52:30.797
I was thinking maybe
I should talk to him.

52:34.542 --> 52:36.271
Blanchard, Homicide.

52:36.510 --> 52:37.602
Lee.

53:00.067 --> 53:02.592
All right, people,
let's get back to work here.

53:02.670 --> 53:04.228
Yeah, it's an earthquake.
I heard it.

53:56.223 --> 53:58.817
Look, I didn't know
you were a boxer.

53:59.326 --> 54:02.693
Daddy's heard of you
and he insists
you stay for dinner.

54:02.763 --> 54:05.231
I told him
we met at that art exhibit
at Stanley Rose's Book Shop.

54:05.299 --> 54:08.928
So, if you have
to pump everybody
for my alibi, be subtle.

54:13.941 --> 54:15.101
Who's this?

54:15.175 --> 54:16.574
Balto.

54:16.677 --> 54:20.511
The paper is the <i>L.A. Times</i>
for August 1, 1926.

54:21.015 --> 54:22.482
Balto was bringing in
the paper

54:22.549 --> 54:25.143
when Daddy found out
he made his first million.

54:25.619 --> 54:28.417
He wanted to consecrate
the moment,

54:28.722 --> 54:30.246
so he shot him.

54:31.392 --> 54:32.791
Here we go.

54:34.828 --> 54:38.491
Mother, Father,
this is my friend, Bucky.

54:39.133 --> 54:42.227
Bucky, this is my mother,
Ramona Cathcart Linscott.

54:42.303 --> 54:43.930
Nice to meet you.

54:44.204 --> 54:46.229
My father,
Emmett Linscott.

54:46.307 --> 54:47.569
Pleasure to meet you,
sir.

54:47.641 --> 54:50.439
And my sister,
Martha McConville Linscott.

54:50.778 --> 54:51.802
Hi.

54:53.113 --> 54:57.072
Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez.
Boxed the pants off him.

54:57.251 --> 54:59.185
Another Billy Conn
you might have been.

54:59.253 --> 55:00.345
Thanks.

55:00.421 --> 55:01.752
Can I get you something?
Sure.

55:01.822 --> 55:04.222
I'll get it, Daddy.
Okay, darling.

55:04.291 --> 55:07.454
Mondo gave a good show.
Whatever happened to him?

55:08.162 --> 55:09.754
Heroin overdose.

55:09.930 --> 55:11.158
Too bad.

55:11.699 --> 55:13.496
He shamed his family.

55:14.501 --> 55:16.469
And speaking of families,

55:16.770 --> 55:18.567
Ramona, Martha.

55:19.540 --> 55:21.974
That's our best Glenlivet,
laddie.

55:26.580 --> 55:30.414
Madeleine says nice things
about you.

55:31.652 --> 55:32.812
Daddy,

55:34.421 --> 55:35.786
can we eat?

55:36.690 --> 55:39.284
Bucky and I want
to catch a 9:30 show.

55:40.427 --> 55:42.156
Of course, darling.

55:48.602 --> 55:49.762
Dig in, lad.

55:49.870 --> 55:52.202
Hearty fare breeds
hearty people.

55:52.272 --> 55:54.672
Haute cuisine breeds
degenerates.

55:55.542 --> 55:57.908
I want to draw
Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

55:57.978 --> 56:00.640
You're in for
a cruel caricaturing, Bucky.

56:00.714 --> 56:04.241
Maddy's my pretty one,
but Martha's
my certified genius.

56:04.618 --> 56:06.848
What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?

56:06.920 --> 56:08.114
German.

56:08.889 --> 56:11.016
A great people, the Germans.

56:11.325 --> 56:13.418
Hitler was a bit excessive.

56:13.827 --> 56:15.818
But mark my words
that someday we'll regret

56:15.896 --> 56:18.888
not joining forces with him
to fight the Reds.

56:19.032 --> 56:22.695
You know,
I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war.

56:22.770 --> 56:25.933
Mr. Bleichert, have you
met Balto in the hallway?

56:26.373 --> 56:28.102
Yes. Very realistic.

56:28.175 --> 56:30.109
An old friend
stuffed him.

56:30.177 --> 56:32.645
We were in the Scots Regiment
together. Georgie Tilden.

56:32.713 --> 56:34.271
He wanted to work
in the flickers.

56:34.348 --> 56:35.372
When did you move here?

56:35.449 --> 56:36.507
1920.

56:36.583 --> 56:40.178
Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming.

56:40.254 --> 56:42.688
Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses.

56:42.756 --> 56:45.190
Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett.

56:45.259 --> 56:47.193
I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up

56:47.261 --> 56:49.195
underneath
that god-awful sign.

56:49.329 --> 56:50.421
Hollywoodland.

56:50.497 --> 56:51.691
I used to love
the <i>Keystone Kops.</i>

56:51.765 --> 56:53.494
Me, too.

56:53.567 --> 56:56.365
Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry.

56:57.704 --> 57:01.140
He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa.

57:01.608 --> 57:03.439
Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland

57:03.510 --> 57:04.909
after 12 hours
on a silent flicker.

57:04.978 --> 57:08.345
Then put in another six hours
by torchlight.

57:08.415 --> 57:11.509
He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times.

57:15.756 --> 57:16.950
Mother.

57:17.558 --> 57:19.321
Are you feeling well?

57:19.393 --> 57:22.556
Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?

57:27.234 --> 57:30.328
Did you know, Mr. Bleichert,

57:32.606 --> 57:35.336
that Ramona Boulevard
is named after me?

57:36.143 --> 57:37.405
I didn't.

57:38.445 --> 57:41.642
When Emmett married me,

57:43.083 --> 57:44.948
for my father's money,

57:46.286 --> 57:48.982
he promised my family
that he would use
his influence

57:49.056 --> 57:51.115
with the City Zoning Board

57:51.225 --> 57:53.557
to have a street named
after me.

57:55.462 --> 57:57.362
But all he could manage

57:58.599 --> 58:00.362
was a dead-end block

58:01.168 --> 58:03.068
in a red-light district

58:04.404 --> 58:06.872
in Lincoln Heights.

58:08.075 --> 58:11.511
Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr. Bleichert?

58:12.779 --> 58:14.371
I grew up there.

58:19.052 --> 58:20.314
Yes, well,

58:20.854 --> 58:24.153
then you'll know
that Mexican prostitutes

58:25.158 --> 58:27.353
expose themselves
in windows.

58:29.196 --> 58:33.155
I hear many of them
know Mr. Linscott by name.

58:33.367 --> 58:34.857
That's enough!

58:37.638 --> 58:42.473
I will sing for my supper

58:42.876 --> 58:46.073
when Mayor Bowron comes
to dinner,

58:46.146 --> 58:48.774
but not

58:48.849 --> 58:52.250
for Madeleine's male whores.

58:52.653 --> 58:54.780
He's a common policeman.

58:54.855 --> 58:56.049
My God, Emmett!

58:58.725 --> 59:00.522
How little you think of me.

59:15.709 --> 59:19.167
I'm sorry.
I'm really so sorry.

59:22.082 --> 59:23.344
Mr. Bleichert.

1:01:11.158 --> 1:01:13.422
You kept your name
out of the papers.

1:01:14.361 --> 1:01:15.828
Until the wedding.

1:01:16.797 --> 1:01:18.628
Your mother would love that.

1:01:20.967 --> 1:01:22.366
She's a snob.

1:01:30.010 --> 1:01:32.774
The kind who takes pills
the doctor gives her

1:01:34.981 --> 1:01:37.745
so she doesn't have to admit
to being a hophead.

1:01:44.758 --> 1:01:46.692
Do you want to know a secret?

1:01:46.760 --> 1:01:48.022
Sure.

1:01:49.463 --> 1:01:51.055
Daddy bought
rotten lumber

1:01:51.131 --> 1:01:52.962
and old movie sets
from Mack Sennett

1:01:53.033 --> 1:01:54.933
and built houses
out of them.

1:01:55.502 --> 1:01:57.697
That's how he really made
his money.

1:02:00.006 --> 1:02:02.702
He's got firetraps
all over L.A.

1:02:04.511 --> 1:02:09.210
His good friend Georgie,
maimed in a car crash,

1:02:10.317 --> 1:02:12.478
while running Daddy
some errands.

1:02:14.187 --> 1:02:16.747
And now he throws him scraps,

1:02:16.823 --> 1:02:20.088
odd jobs, tending
Daddy's rental properties.

1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:22.451
You don't have
to tell me this.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:27.967
I like you, Bucky.

1:02:40.747 --> 1:02:42.977
I didn't tell you
all about Betty.

1:02:44.651 --> 1:02:45.879
You didn't?

1:02:46.353 --> 1:02:48.287
Don't be mad at me.

1:02:49.556 --> 1:02:53.356
Last summer, I heard about
a girl who looked like me.

1:02:54.094 --> 1:02:55.755
I got curious.

1:02:56.630 --> 1:02:58.120
I left notes
at a couple of places,

1:02:58.198 --> 1:03:01.224
"Your look-alike
wants to meet you,"
things like that.

1:03:01.735 --> 1:03:03.225
I left my number.

1:03:04.538 --> 1:03:05.869
She called.

1:03:07.073 --> 1:03:09.633
That's how I met her
at LaVerne's with Lorna.

1:03:11.578 --> 1:03:13.273
And that's all of it?

1:03:13.346 --> 1:03:14.540
Yes.

1:03:32.098 --> 1:03:33.497
Tell me something.

1:03:34.868 --> 1:03:37.200
Why'd you want to meet
Betty Short anyway?

1:03:37.270 --> 1:03:40.205
I've worked hard to be loose

1:03:43.343 --> 1:03:45.743
but the way people
described Betty

1:03:48.215 --> 1:03:50.615
it was like she was a natural.

1:03:51.484 --> 1:03:52.781
<i>"Don't walk out on me,</i>
<i>Richard.</i>

1:03:52.853 --> 1:03:54.343
<i>"Say you care.</i>
<i>Say that you..."</i>

1:03:54.421 --> 1:03:55.683
<i>Miss Short.</i>

1:03:55.755 --> 1:03:58.223
<i>There is a pause</i>
<i>after "care".</i>

1:03:58.291 --> 1:04:00.657
<i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with the English language?</i>

1:04:03.163 --> 1:04:04.528
<i>I try to be.</i>

1:04:04.598 --> 1:04:05.826
<i>Okay.</i>

1:04:06.867 --> 1:04:08.494
<i>Let's try it again.</i>

1:04:08.568 --> 1:04:11.435
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>go back to the beginning,</i>
<i>you're begging him.</i>

1:04:11.504 --> 1:04:12.869
<i>Begging.</i>

1:04:12.939 --> 1:04:14.201
<i>He's walking out on you.</i>

1:04:14.274 --> 1:04:15.468
<i>You're begging him.</i>

1:04:15.542 --> 1:04:16.531
<i>So, come on, let's do it.</i>

1:04:16.610 --> 1:04:18.669
<i>We're running out of</i>
<i>film here. Let's go.</i>

1:04:30.390 --> 1:04:35.191
<i>Richard,</i>
<i>don't walk out on me.</i>

1:04:37.097 --> 1:04:38.189
<i>Please say that you care.</i>

1:04:38.265 --> 1:04:42.531
<i>Say that you think</i>
<i>that I'm beautiful,</i>

1:04:42.602 --> 1:04:44.229
<i>and that you love me.</i>

1:04:44.404 --> 1:04:48.841
<i>Miss Short, you know,</i>
<i>this is a very sad scene.</i>

1:04:48.909 --> 1:04:53.039
<i>Do you think you're capable</i>
<i>of playing sadness?</i>

1:04:58.919 --> 1:05:00.079
<i>Sure.</i>

1:05:02.255 --> 1:05:03.779
<i>I can do that.</i>

1:05:50.337 --> 1:05:51.361
Miss!

1:05:59.479 --> 1:06:01.674
Get your hands off her!
I'm an emancipated minor

1:06:01.748 --> 1:06:03.215
and if you touch me

1:06:03.283 --> 1:06:05.717
without a matron present
I'll sue you!

1:06:05.785 --> 1:06:07.309
Leave her alone.
No!

1:06:07.921 --> 1:06:10.481
I'm a policeman. Policeman.

1:06:11.691 --> 1:06:14.717
You and Betty made
the casting rounds
together, right?

1:06:14.828 --> 1:06:15.988
Did you ever get
any movie work?

1:06:16.062 --> 1:06:17.290
No.

1:06:17.497 --> 1:06:19.692
Well, then,
what about the film can?

1:06:21.534 --> 1:06:24.367
It's a movie.

1:06:24.437 --> 1:06:25.836
What kind of movie?

1:06:25.905 --> 1:06:28.533
Something tells me
it's not David O. Selznick.

1:06:29.142 --> 1:06:33.476
Now, you have to tell us
the whole thing, sweetheart,
so think it through.

1:06:36.549 --> 1:06:40.110
I was cadging
at a bar in Gardena.

1:06:41.254 --> 1:06:43.552
This man started
talking to me.

1:06:45.392 --> 1:06:48.156
I thought I was pregnant

1:06:48.228 --> 1:06:51.129
and I was desperate
wicked bad for money.

1:06:51.998 --> 1:06:55.525
He said he'd give me $200
to act in a nudie film.

1:06:57.637 --> 1:07:01.801
He said he needed another
girl, so I called Betty.

1:07:06.046 --> 1:07:07.843
We made... Thank you.

1:07:08.014 --> 1:07:10.710
...the movie at this big house

1:07:10.784 --> 1:07:12.376
a couple of hours
outside town.

1:07:13.353 --> 1:07:15.048
Then he drove us
back to L.A.

1:07:15.121 --> 1:07:17.055
Where was this house,
exactly?

1:07:19.392 --> 1:07:21.622
I was pretty out of it,
if you know what I mean.

1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:22.453
What do you think, Russ?

1:08:22.522 --> 1:08:25.218
This got anything to do
with the girl's murder?

1:08:25.492 --> 1:08:26.823
Long shot, Chief.

1:09:11.871 --> 1:09:15.739
What's that about, gentlemen?
Your boy can't hold his water?

1:09:15.909 --> 1:09:17.274
I got you Warrants.

1:09:17.343 --> 1:09:19.208
You're my men
and you made me
look like a fool

1:09:19.279 --> 1:09:21.770
in front of
the most powerful
man in the department.

1:09:21.848 --> 1:09:25.045
And you...
Yeah, you. Look at me.

1:09:25.218 --> 1:09:27.948
Blanchard? Look at me!

1:09:29.656 --> 1:09:31.180
If you weren't Mr. Fire,

1:09:31.457 --> 1:09:33.322
you would be suspended
from duty already.

1:09:33.393 --> 1:09:35.623
You're a punch-drunk,
washed-up fighter...

1:09:35.695 --> 1:09:37.162
Stay out of this, Bleichert!

1:09:37.230 --> 1:09:39.357
You're back on Warrants
as of tomorrow.

1:09:39.432 --> 1:09:41.957
I want you to report to me
at 0800

1:09:42.035 --> 1:09:44.094
with a letter of apology
for Chief Green.

1:09:44.604 --> 1:09:47.505
You are a political animal,

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:49.369
and for the sake
of your pension,

1:09:49.442 --> 1:09:51.410
I suggest that you grovel.

1:10:09.329 --> 1:10:11.889
It is now 8:15
in the morning.

1:10:11.965 --> 1:10:13.455
Where's your partner?

1:10:13.733 --> 1:10:14.961
I don't know.
I was hoping he'd be here.

1:10:15.034 --> 1:10:17.662
Well, it is 8:15
and he is not here

1:10:17.737 --> 1:10:19.796
and neither
are his letters of apology.

1:10:30.850 --> 1:10:34.047
Bleichert,
get out of my sight.

1:10:35.054 --> 1:10:36.715
<i>Try and be a police officer.</i>

1:10:36.789 --> 1:10:40.190
<i>Attention</i>
<i>all units in the vicinity</i>
<i>of Crenshaw and Stocker.</i>

1:10:40.260 --> 1:10:41.591
<i>Code four.</i>

1:10:41.661 --> 1:10:44.095
<i>Two dead. Suspect, dead.</i>

1:10:44.731 --> 1:10:49.634
<i>Raymond "Junior" Nash.</i>
<i>Warrant number 5-6-0-9.</i>

1:10:49.769 --> 1:10:51.669
<i>Repeat. Code four.</i>

1:11:20.900 --> 1:11:22.731
<i>We forgot</i>
<i>about Junior Nash.</i>

1:11:25.204 --> 1:11:27.764
<i>Here he is, dead</i>
<i>in the middle of a stickup.</i>

1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:29.271
<i>He was trash and a killer</i>

1:11:29.342 --> 1:11:31.310
<i>and I'd been right</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

1:11:32.512 --> 1:11:34.878
<i>We let him slip</i>
<i>and the innocent died.</i>

1:11:50.697 --> 1:11:51.686
Blanchard!

1:11:51.764 --> 1:11:52.958
He's in the men's.

1:11:58.838 --> 1:12:01.306
No. I beat up a wall.
For messing up Nash...

1:12:01.374 --> 1:12:02.739
Not good enough.

1:12:03.142 --> 1:12:04.473
I'm sorry, Bucky.

1:12:04.544 --> 1:12:06.136
Not good enough.

1:12:11.017 --> 1:12:12.245
I'm sorry.

1:12:15.221 --> 1:12:17.587
Oh, fuck, Lee! Fuck!

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:20.858
<i>Losing the first</i>
<i>Bleichert-Blanchard fight</i>

1:12:20.927 --> 1:12:22.451
<i>got me local celebrity</i>
<i>Warrants</i>

1:12:22.528 --> 1:12:24.928
<i>and close to nine grand</i>
<i>in cash.</i>

1:12:25.698 --> 1:12:27.461
<i>Winning the rematch</i>
<i>got me a sprained wrist,</i>

1:12:27.533 --> 1:12:29.797
<i>two dislocated knuckles</i>
<i>and the rest of the day off.</i>

1:12:29.869 --> 1:12:31.200
Smile at me.

1:12:32.605 --> 1:12:35.039
Look soft and sweet.

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:43.044
I picked up
Lorna Mertz yesterday.

1:12:46.018 --> 1:12:49.419
She had a copy
of a stag film,

1:12:49.489 --> 1:12:51.582
her and Betty Short
playing les.

1:12:54.527 --> 1:12:56.119
Pretty spooky stuff.

1:12:59.031 --> 1:13:00.794
Did she mention me?

1:13:01.067 --> 1:13:02.534
No.

1:13:08.141 --> 1:13:09.972
And I checked
the case file.

1:13:11.544 --> 1:13:14.775
No mention of that
number-leaving note
thing that you did.

1:13:24.123 --> 1:13:25.283
Listen,

1:13:31.931 --> 1:13:34.024
I'm withholding evidence
for you.

1:13:36.035 --> 1:13:38.162
It's a fair trade
but it shakes me.

1:13:40.606 --> 1:13:41.868
Are you sure
there isn't anything

1:13:41.941 --> 1:13:44.102
you haven't told me
about you and Betty?

1:13:53.352 --> 1:13:56.515
Betty and I made love once,
that one time last summer.

1:14:03.129 --> 1:14:05.120
I just did it to see
what it would be like

1:14:05.198 --> 1:14:06.665
to do it with someone
who looked like me.

1:14:06.732 --> 1:14:07.960
Jesus Christ.

1:14:15.141 --> 1:14:18.008
Bucky, that's it. I swear.

1:14:26.118 --> 1:14:27.745
Bucky, please stay.

1:14:31.123 --> 1:14:32.454
You stupid slut.

1:14:32.525 --> 1:14:34.083
Stay. Sugar, stay!

1:15:02.722 --> 1:15:03.711
Hey.

1:15:06.492 --> 1:15:07.982
We're famous, Dwight.

1:15:10.630 --> 1:15:11.824
Notorious.

1:15:13.666 --> 1:15:14.997
Where's Lee?

1:15:21.541 --> 1:15:23.907
Bobby DeWitt's
probably in L.A. by now.

1:15:26.145 --> 1:15:28.238
Lee always said I'd be safe.

1:15:30.082 --> 1:15:33.210
You will be. You will be.

1:15:38.257 --> 1:15:39.747
He had a sister.

1:15:42.028 --> 1:15:43.086
What?

1:15:46.432 --> 1:15:48.059
He had a little sister.

1:15:48.834 --> 1:15:50.597
She was killed
when Lee was 15,

1:15:50.670 --> 1:15:52.661
and they never
caught the guy.

1:15:57.577 --> 1:15:58.669
Why...

1:15:59.912 --> 1:16:01.641
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

1:16:01.714 --> 1:16:03.978
He made me promise
never to tell you.

1:16:05.618 --> 1:16:08.018
He thought it made him
too easy to figure.

1:16:08.087 --> 1:16:10.248
Well, it sure explains
some things.

1:16:11.724 --> 1:16:13.089
No, it doesn't.

1:16:13.159 --> 1:16:14.490
Kay, where's Lee?

1:16:17.897 --> 1:16:19.922
If you know,
you should tell me.

1:16:23.235 --> 1:16:26.398
Kay,
Bobby DeWitt just got out.

1:16:27.273 --> 1:16:28.865
Lee's all hopped up
on Benzedrine,

1:16:28.941 --> 1:16:31.205
so what do you
think is going to happen?

1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:35.908
Where is he?

1:16:43.789 --> 1:16:46.622
Morrie Friedman called
a couple of hours ago.

1:16:47.326 --> 1:16:49.021
The guy from New Year's?

1:16:50.830 --> 1:16:52.957
Bobby's got a drug deal
somewhere

1:16:53.733 --> 1:16:55.997
in a building Friedman owns,
the Olympic, I think.

1:16:56.068 --> 1:16:57.057
When?

1:17:02.408 --> 1:17:03.807
Now.
Jesus.

1:17:03.876 --> 1:17:05.002
Dwight.

1:17:53.192 --> 1:17:54.420
Bobby DeWitt?

1:17:54.827 --> 1:17:55.953
Get your hands up.

1:17:56.028 --> 1:17:57.620
Get up against that wall
over there.

1:17:57.697 --> 1:17:59.858
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1:17:59.932 --> 1:18:01.365
Jesus.

1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:17.075
I ain't out one week, and...

1:18:19.385 --> 1:18:21.853
You're here for a drug deal
with Morrie Friedman.
I know that.

1:18:21.921 --> 1:18:24.116
Look, I'm just looking
for a place to take a piss.

1:18:24.190 --> 1:18:26.385
Lee Blanchard's here.
Did you know that?
Blanchard?

1:18:26.459 --> 1:18:29.622
Man-oh-Manischewitz,
I ain't seen Blanchard
since my fucking trial.

1:18:29.695 --> 1:18:31.162
Yeah,
but he's been on your mind.

1:18:31.230 --> 1:18:32.697
And you've been on his mind.

1:18:32.765 --> 1:18:35.893
I'm thinking that you let
the word out there knowing
he'd come down here.

1:18:35.968 --> 1:18:39.165
Look, maybe
I flapped my trap at trial.
Maybe I was thinking revenge,

1:18:39.238 --> 1:18:40.796
maybe talking trash
to my cellies,

1:18:40.873 --> 1:18:42.738
but all I know is
what I read in the papers,

1:18:42.808 --> 1:18:45.436
and when that fucker
killed them niggers...

1:18:45.511 --> 1:18:46.603
Finish up.

1:18:46.679 --> 1:18:48.738
I don't know
what his version is.
What's your version?

1:18:48.814 --> 1:18:50.577
Sir, all this between
me and Blanchard

1:18:50.649 --> 1:18:53.243
is that I fucked this
big-tittied Dakota cunt
named Kay Lake...

1:18:53.319 --> 1:18:54.547
Hold it, pal.

1:19:24.884 --> 1:19:26.476
Blanchard, behind you!

1:19:32.158 --> 1:19:33.386
Blanchard!

1:20:29.348 --> 1:20:30.508
No!

1:21:00.379 --> 1:21:01.368
Here.

1:21:06.385 --> 1:21:08.546
My apologies,
Officer Bleichert.

1:21:08.921 --> 1:21:13.415
My men are instructed
not to take any chances,
and you did have a gun.

1:21:17.997 --> 1:21:19.828
The guy
with the choke rope,

1:21:22.101 --> 1:21:24.467
I assume DeWitt brought him
for muscle.

1:21:25.137 --> 1:21:28.903
No identification,
nothing left of his face
after he hit the fountain.

1:21:28.974 --> 1:21:32.102
You understand why we must
handle things like this, huh?

1:21:33.445 --> 1:21:34.912
It's your building.

1:21:34.980 --> 1:21:36.345
Uh-huh.

1:21:38.384 --> 1:21:40.477
Come on. Bring him in.
Get him in here.

1:21:43.989 --> 1:21:45.183
Officer?

1:21:47.726 --> 1:21:49.250
See what we got here?

1:21:52.197 --> 1:21:54.688
I can't think of another way,
can you?

1:21:56.735 --> 1:21:57.827
Come here.

1:21:58.671 --> 1:21:59.797
Come on.

1:22:00.439 --> 1:22:01.463
Come.

1:22:22.227 --> 1:22:23.819
Want to say something?

1:22:31.003 --> 1:22:32.300
Fire and Ice.

1:22:38.077 --> 1:22:39.237
Fire and Ice.

1:22:39.311 --> 1:22:40.642
Excuse me?

1:22:44.516 --> 1:22:45.710
Nothing.

1:22:50.289 --> 1:22:51.688
Just do it quick.

1:23:37.736 --> 1:23:41.069
What happened?
What happened?

1:23:45.711 --> 1:23:48.145
What happened?
What happened?

1:24:03.695 --> 1:24:05.026
<i>Stolen witness reports,</i>

1:24:05.097 --> 1:24:07.088
<i>medical records,</i>
<i>autopsy photos.</i>

1:24:08.033 --> 1:24:10.194
<i>Lee had turned his life</i>
<i>inside out</i>

1:24:10.436 --> 1:24:14.065
<i>and my dad's apartment</i>
<i>into the Black Dahlia's</i>
<i>House of Horrors.</i>

1:24:16.275 --> 1:24:18.641
<i>I confessed</i>
<i>to the only priest I needed.</i>

1:24:20.412 --> 1:24:22.607
How long have you known
about this?

1:24:26.051 --> 1:24:27.382
I don't know.

1:24:27.820 --> 1:24:29.549
Why show me now?

1:24:32.691 --> 1:24:34.090
I don't know.

1:24:39.431 --> 1:24:41.558
He's not coming back,
is he, Buck?

1:24:49.708 --> 1:24:51.642
Stupid son of a bitch,

1:24:51.944 --> 1:24:55.710
getting himself killed
over a little mope
like Bobby DeWitt.

1:24:56.281 --> 1:24:57.373
Damn.

1:25:00.586 --> 1:25:01.985
Did you tell Kay?

1:25:07.793 --> 1:25:11.820
Well, that's as far
as it goes, then.

1:25:13.198 --> 1:25:14.790
Mo Friedman was right.

1:25:15.767 --> 1:25:19.760
Our boy doesn't need
any more headlines.
Neither does Kay.

1:25:21.406 --> 1:25:22.498
This...

1:25:24.510 --> 1:25:26.410
I want you to
stick with me here.

1:25:27.479 --> 1:25:29.640
We are going to make
something of this.

1:25:29.715 --> 1:25:32.513
<i>What's a sexy girl</i>
<i>like you so sad about?</i>

1:25:33.785 --> 1:25:35.013
<i>Nothing.</i>

1:25:36.555 --> 1:25:39.285
<i>You've got tears</i>
<i>running down your face.</i>
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

1:25:39.358 --> 1:25:40.882
<i>Just a bad day.</i>

1:25:43.195 --> 1:25:45.129
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>You must have a lot of fun.</i>

1:25:45.197 --> 1:25:47.791
<i>You look like you have</i>
<i>a hell of a lot of fun.</i>
<i>Oh, I sure do.</i>

1:25:47.866 --> 1:25:49.834
<i>I'm a fun-loving gal.</i>

1:25:50.335 --> 1:25:53.168
<i>You got any special guys</i>
<i>that you, you know...</i>

1:25:53.605 --> 1:25:55.232
<i>I have a fianc√©.</i>

1:25:56.475 --> 1:25:58.340
<i>Yeah, I met him in Florida.</i>

1:25:58.744 --> 1:26:01.235
<i>And it was one</i>
<i>of those things that was...</i>

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:04.742
<i>Gosh, I don't know</i>
<i>if you've experienced</i>
<i>this before,</i>

1:26:04.816 --> 1:26:06.374
<i>but it was love</i>
<i>at first sight.</i>

1:26:06.451 --> 1:26:09.318
<i>Yeah, I get it</i>
<i>about five times a night.</i>

1:26:11.156 --> 1:26:12.487
<i>That's what it was.</i>

1:26:12.758 --> 1:26:14.783
<i>He asked me to marry him</i>
<i>that night.</i>

1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:17.928
<i>And then, the next day,</i>
<i>he was just gone.</i>

1:26:18.197 --> 1:26:22.065
<i>Well, that "ask you</i>
<i>to marry him" always works.</i>

1:26:22.134 --> 1:26:24.534
<i>No, he promised</i>
<i>he'd come back.</i>

1:26:24.603 --> 1:26:28.699
<i>He was an Air Force captain,</i>
<i>which is why he had to leave.</i>
<i>He went overseas.</i>

1:26:29.274 --> 1:26:31.265
<i>And you know</i>
<i>what he used to do?</i>

1:26:32.177 --> 1:26:34.805
<i>He used to write me</i>

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:38.839
<i>such beautiful, florid,</i>
<i>romantic love letters.</i>

1:26:39.918 --> 1:26:41.385
<i>Oh, a poet.</i>

1:26:42.020 --> 1:26:45.547
<i>Just a decent guy.</i>

1:26:45.624 --> 1:26:48.991
<i>So, what happened</i>
<i>to Prince Charming?</i>

1:26:56.535 --> 1:27:00.801
<i>Well, the night that</i>
<i>he was supposed to come back,</i>

1:27:01.073 --> 1:27:04.167
<i>he was called to</i>
<i>do one last mission</i>

1:27:04.243 --> 1:27:06.643
<i>and his plane crashed</i>

1:27:09.147 --> 1:27:10.512
<i>over India.</i>

1:27:12.284 --> 1:27:13.808
<i>And now he's dead.</i>

1:27:16.488 --> 1:27:19.855
<i>Boy, you sure know</i>
<i>how to tell a funny story.</i>

1:27:21.860 --> 1:27:23.384
<i>Yeah, I sure do.</i>

1:27:26.598 --> 1:27:29.066
<i>Okay. Should I read</i>
<i>into the camera?</i>

1:27:29.134 --> 1:27:30.192
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:27:30.269 --> 1:27:31.258
<i>Okay.</i>

1:27:35.007 --> 1:27:37.373
<i>I'm told that</i>
<i>I'm very photogenic.</i>

1:27:42.781 --> 1:27:45.579
I'm collating the KA update
sheets for tomorrow.

1:27:45.651 --> 1:27:47.642
Anything new
you need him to add?

1:27:47.719 --> 1:27:48.913
No.

1:27:49.454 --> 1:27:51.251
Dolph's tonight?

1:27:51.657 --> 1:27:53.386
I'm going to Kay's.

1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:58.953
Wednesday nights
were the nights she'd make
Lee and me a big dinner, so...

1:27:59.164 --> 1:28:00.893
We haven't done it since.

1:28:07.306 --> 1:28:08.796
We're going to try.

1:28:22.421 --> 1:28:24.116
Should we say something?

1:28:27.893 --> 1:28:29.622
We haven't said anything.

1:28:37.069 --> 1:28:38.866
To my supercops.

1:28:45.510 --> 1:28:48.001
I feel like I haven't said
anything right.

1:28:49.247 --> 1:28:51.147
Haven't done anything right.

1:28:51.983 --> 1:28:53.473
There's nothing to say.

1:28:53.552 --> 1:28:54.746
There is.

1:28:57.422 --> 1:28:58.787
There is.

1:29:01.927 --> 1:29:03.292
He saved my life.

1:29:05.497 --> 1:29:10.491
He saved my life,
and I saw him there
and I couldn't...

1:29:11.236 --> 1:29:12.396
Dwight.

1:29:17.943 --> 1:29:19.535
I couldn't move.

1:29:21.747 --> 1:29:23.305
I couldn't move.

1:29:25.384 --> 1:29:26.749
I didn't move.

1:29:29.521 --> 1:29:33.582
I never move. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1:29:34.526 --> 1:29:36.153
Kay, I'm sorry.

1:29:46.138 --> 1:29:47.503
I'm sorry.

1:29:48.106 --> 1:29:51.439
I could've saved him.
I could've saved him.

1:31:14.526 --> 1:31:16.517
"Shoddy home construction?"

1:31:17.963 --> 1:31:20.022
I cut my foot
on a bathroom tile.

1:31:20.465 --> 1:31:22.126
You got it in you
to replace a few?

1:31:22.934 --> 1:31:24.299
Yeah, of course.

1:31:58.236 --> 1:31:59.328
Dwight.

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:09.469
Dwight.

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:44.310
I'd always wondered
where he kept it.

1:32:48.987 --> 1:32:50.978
Were you ever
going to tell me?

1:32:55.493 --> 1:32:58.189
He'd given all his money
to Ben Siegel and he...

1:32:59.564 --> 1:33:01.054
He wanted to buy us a home.

1:33:01.132 --> 1:33:02.963
I didn't know
there was any left.

1:33:07.305 --> 1:33:09.296
Were you ever
going to tell me?

1:33:10.809 --> 1:33:12.367
Something's burning.

1:33:21.152 --> 1:33:24.519
Bobby did do
the bank job, Dwight.
Don't get the wrong idea.

1:33:24.789 --> 1:33:27.485
I don't know
what kind of idea
I got right now.

1:33:33.398 --> 1:33:36.697
Things were getting really
bad between me and Bobby,
and I had to get out.

1:33:36.768 --> 1:33:40.295
I knew this guy that Bobby
made me be with once.

1:33:40.672 --> 1:33:42.037
He was a hophead
who let it slip

1:33:42.107 --> 1:33:44.132
that he sometimes snitched
to the cops for dope money.

1:33:44.209 --> 1:33:45.733
And that's how you met Lee?

1:33:45.810 --> 1:33:50.110
I told him what Bobby was
doing to me, how he cut me
and pimped me to his friends

1:33:50.181 --> 1:33:54.049
and I told him about
the bank job and where
Bobby was hiding the money.

1:33:55.954 --> 1:33:58.514
And then last year,
the guy...

1:33:58.990 --> 1:34:00.480
The hophead?

1:34:00.558 --> 1:34:01.718
Yeah.

1:34:03.194 --> 1:34:06.220
Lee had given him $1,000
for introducing us.

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.831
He found out
that Bobby was getting out,

1:34:10.902 --> 1:34:13.029
and he threatened to tell him
that we stole from him.

1:34:13.104 --> 1:34:14.935
He wanted money that
we didn't have, Dwight.

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:16.707
He wanted $10,000.

1:34:16.775 --> 1:34:18.504
What were we going to do?

1:34:19.044 --> 1:34:21.672
Promise me, promise me
you'll forgive him
for DeWitt.

1:34:21.746 --> 1:34:25.011
Forgive him
for the bank. Please.
It doesn't matter to us.

1:34:26.584 --> 1:34:28.779
What was the guy's name?
It doesn't matter.

1:34:31.189 --> 1:34:33.020
Kay, tell me the guy's name.

1:34:40.465 --> 1:34:41.898
It was Baxter Fitch.

1:34:44.536 --> 1:34:46.527
<i>Baxter Fitch,</i>
<i>and then DeWitt.</i>

1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:51.836
<i>Lee killed them both</i>
<i>and took the bank money,</i>

1:34:52.777 --> 1:34:55.769
<i>making me witness, stooge,</i>

1:34:56.681 --> 1:34:59.149
<i>weak point</i>
<i>in a fairy tale triangle.</i>

1:34:59.217 --> 1:35:01.515
You're so good
at some things.

1:35:03.788 --> 1:35:06.882
Dwight, he loved you.
He loved both of us,
Dwight, so much.

1:35:06.958 --> 1:35:10.223
This had nothing
to do with us, Dwight!
Nothing! Don't run out on us!

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:17.891
<i>The basic rule</i>
<i>of homicide applied:</i>

1:35:18.303 --> 1:35:20.464
<i>Nothing stays buried forever.</i>

1:35:21.206 --> 1:35:23.936
<i>Corpses. Ghosts.</i>

1:35:25.210 --> 1:35:28.873
<i>Nothing stays buried forever.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

1:35:31.282 --> 1:35:33.250
Family's in Laguna.

1:35:34.552 --> 1:35:37.112
But you know that.
You've been watching.

1:35:39.758 --> 1:35:42.124
<i>Lee and Kay had lived in sin,</i>

1:35:42.961 --> 1:35:45.259
<i>not because their shack job</i>
<i>was against department regs</i>

1:35:45.330 --> 1:35:50.233
<i>but because the ghosts</i>
<i>of their past had forced them</i>
<i>to choose love over passion.</i>

1:35:51.803 --> 1:35:53.896
<i>The veneer of a fairy tale,</i>

1:35:55.273 --> 1:35:58.106
<i>only a band-aid</i>
<i>to cover a fractured life.</i>

1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:04.405
<i>I didn't believe</i>
<i>in fairy tales.</i>

1:36:06.050 --> 1:36:08.541
<i>It was a reunion</i>
<i>of avowed tramps,</i>

1:36:09.154 --> 1:36:12.851
<i>old rutters who knew</i>
<i>they'd never have it</i>
<i>as good with anybody else.</i>

1:37:22.460 --> 1:37:24.257
<i>Have you met</i>
<i>Balto in the hallway?</i>

1:37:24.329 --> 1:37:26.160
<i>An old friend</i>
<i>stuffed him.</i>

1:37:26.331 --> 1:37:28.799
<i>We were in the Scots Regiment</i>
<i>together. Georgie Tilden.</i>

1:37:28.867 --> 1:37:30.994
<i>He wanted to work</i>
<i>in the flickers.</i>

1:37:35.106 --> 1:37:36.573
What?

1:37:36.641 --> 1:37:38.165
Nothing.

1:37:38.710 --> 1:37:40.075
You miss them?

1:37:40.411 --> 1:37:43.642
Mother's insults?
Martha's pornography?

1:37:44.582 --> 1:37:46.607
I just never imagined
Georgie so...

1:37:47.619 --> 1:37:49.246
The way your father
described him.

1:37:50.121 --> 1:37:51.281
Different.

1:37:52.590 --> 1:37:54.080
They were young.

1:37:55.393 --> 1:37:57.361
He died last year. Angina.

1:37:57.996 --> 1:38:01.432
Daddy paid to have him
buried at the family plot
in Scotland.

1:38:04.068 --> 1:38:05.763
That's very nice of him.

1:38:07.538 --> 1:38:09.335
I don't get modern art.

1:38:11.175 --> 1:38:13.609
I doubt modern art
gets you, either.

1:38:15.580 --> 1:38:17.070
But I do.

1:38:40.738 --> 1:38:42.365
Kay, what the hell
are you doing here?

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:43.839
What am I doing here?

1:38:43.908 --> 1:38:45.603
How could you?
How could you?

1:38:45.677 --> 1:38:47.440
You follow me here,
after what you've done?

1:38:47.512 --> 1:38:49.241
What have I done? Nothing!
You lied to me!

1:38:49.314 --> 1:38:51.612
I lied for you!
I lied for us!

1:38:51.683 --> 1:38:53.173
What could I do but lie,
Dwight?

1:38:53.251 --> 1:38:54.582
You could have
told me the truth.

1:38:54.652 --> 1:38:56.142
She looks like
that dead girl!

1:38:56.654 --> 1:38:58.121
How sick are you?

1:39:01.192 --> 1:39:03.683
You're going to end up
like Lee. You will.

1:39:04.595 --> 1:39:06.085
But I will not.

1:39:19.277 --> 1:39:22.678
<i>She looks like that</i>
<i>dead girl! How sick are you?</i>

1:39:24.182 --> 1:39:26.207
<i>You're going to end up</i>
<i>like Lee.</i>

1:40:00.018 --> 1:40:02.578
<i>The set</i>
<i>was enough to tie</i>
<i>Linscott to the porno movie,</i>

1:40:02.653 --> 1:40:04.644
<i>but not to the murder.</i>

1:40:06.257 --> 1:40:09.385
<i>For that, I needed</i>
<i>to stop worrying about</i>
<i>who killed the Dahlia</i>

1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:11.052
<i>and focus on where.</i>

1:40:12.563 --> 1:40:15.259
<i>Georgie</i>
<i>introduced me to Mack Sennett.</i>

1:40:15.333 --> 1:40:17.233
<i>I helped him build</i>
<i>that housing project</i>
<i>he was putting up</i>

1:40:17.301 --> 1:40:20.099
<i>underneath</i>
<i>that god-awful sign.</i>

1:40:20.204 --> 1:40:21.603
<i>Hollywoodland.</i>

1:41:19.263 --> 1:41:21.731
<i>Lorna Mertz said</i>
<i>it was shot out of town.</i>

1:41:23.835 --> 1:41:25.666
<i>People lie.</i>

1:41:40.551 --> 1:41:45.818
<i>Oh, a puncture wound</i>
<i>in the palm of the hand.</i>

1:42:00.037 --> 1:42:04.235
<i>I say then he drained</i>
<i>the blood from the body</i>
<i>and washed it clean.</i>

1:44:06.330 --> 1:44:08.025
I don't
want to go to Europe.

1:44:08.099 --> 1:44:11.500
One of my foremen
said the goddamn pipes
are spewing gas.

1:44:11.936 --> 1:44:13.631
There'll be hell to pay.

1:44:13.804 --> 1:44:17.103
It's about time I showed
the three of you good old
Scotland.

1:44:18.309 --> 1:44:20.504
I don't want to go
to Europe, Daddy.

1:44:20.578 --> 1:44:23.945
You're always talking
about how dreadful
and provincial it is.

1:44:24.081 --> 1:44:27.107
Yeah, but it's got
what you need, lassie.

1:44:27.318 --> 1:44:28.808
What is that, Emmett?

1:44:31.389 --> 1:44:32.856
Saps like me?

1:44:34.325 --> 1:44:35.758
Or is that what you needed?

1:44:35.826 --> 1:44:37.225
Oh, laddie.

1:44:40.031 --> 1:44:41.692
You killed Elizabeth Short,

1:44:42.199 --> 1:44:43.791
and the two of you
covered it up.

1:44:44.869 --> 1:44:47.429
You made that stag film
with Lorna and Betty.

1:44:48.639 --> 1:44:50.038
I've seen the set.

1:44:51.475 --> 1:44:53.966
I found it all.
Put that gun down, laddie.

1:44:54.078 --> 1:44:57.206
You're not the shooting type
and I'm not the dying type.

1:45:02.019 --> 1:45:03.350
You might be half right.

1:45:03.421 --> 1:45:05.889
Jesus Christ, Bleichert.
That's a Ming.

1:45:05.956 --> 1:45:07.514
Great. Let's talk art.

1:45:07.591 --> 1:45:10.958
Let's talk <i>The Man Who Laughs</i>.
I've seen the movie.

1:45:11.896 --> 1:45:13.158
I've got you.

1:45:13.230 --> 1:45:14.822
So you don't
like my taste in art.

1:45:14.899 --> 1:45:16.457
I don't think
that's a crime.

1:45:19.503 --> 1:45:21.994
Stop! Georgie did it!

1:45:24.909 --> 1:45:25.933
Oh, that's rich.

1:45:26.377 --> 1:45:27.810
Blame it on the poor,
dead gardener.

1:45:27.878 --> 1:45:30.369
No, Bucky. It's true.
Believe him.

1:45:30.681 --> 1:45:33.172
Georgie was always sneaking
around Daddy's properties.

1:45:33.250 --> 1:45:36.378
He saw them make the movie
and he got crazy about Betty.

1:45:41.692 --> 1:45:42.784
More.

1:45:43.594 --> 1:45:45.289
There are so many
pretty things here, Emmett.

1:45:45.363 --> 1:45:46.591
All right.

1:45:47.365 --> 1:45:50.061
Betty called,
short of cash, as usual.

1:45:50.301 --> 1:45:53.828
I put Daddy on
and he offered her money
to date a nice man he knew.

1:45:53.904 --> 1:45:55.633
You must've known
he was a sick fuck then.

1:45:55.706 --> 1:46:00.006
Well, he was passive.
I mean, he liked
to touch dead things.

1:46:00.077 --> 1:46:01.942
I mean,
his father was a surgeon.

1:46:02.012 --> 1:46:04.412
Did you know that?
Famous in Scotland.

1:46:04.482 --> 1:46:06.382
We didn't know
he'd go crazy like that.

1:46:06.450 --> 1:46:07.610
Liar!

1:46:08.285 --> 1:46:09.377
Liar!

1:46:10.354 --> 1:46:14.222
You did him enough damage,
Emmett. Now you let him go!

1:46:19.063 --> 1:46:23.796
I would appreciate it
if you just stopped shooting
things, Officer, though.

1:46:24.435 --> 1:46:28.098
The rich don't own art
just for themselves.

1:46:28.172 --> 1:46:31.141
We safe keep it
for future generations.

1:46:31.342 --> 1:46:33.276
How did Emmett damage Georgie?

1:46:34.578 --> 1:46:36.944
What did he do
to make him go so crazy?

1:46:41.786 --> 1:46:46.780
Who made what made who crazy?

1:46:51.829 --> 1:46:55.595
It was Madeleine.

1:46:56.734 --> 1:46:58.531
She was 11 years old,

1:47:01.071 --> 1:47:03.301
and she looked
just like Georgie.

1:47:03.374 --> 1:47:04.398
Ramona!

1:47:04.475 --> 1:47:08.468
Shut up, Emmett!

1:47:13.684 --> 1:47:17.211
That's right, Officer.
George and me.

1:47:18.722 --> 1:47:20.815
Not that Emmett cared
about that.

1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:24.653
But he was her father.

1:47:25.329 --> 1:47:27.456
And for that,

1:47:27.531 --> 1:47:31.023
he ruined George's face.

1:47:36.373 --> 1:47:38.864
When he got out of hospital,

1:47:38.943 --> 1:47:42.902
I gave him the Hugo book
as a present.

1:47:43.981 --> 1:47:46.211
He had worked construction
on that movie with Emmett.

1:47:46.283 --> 1:47:48.547
It was always
one of his favorites.

1:47:50.454 --> 1:47:52.615
That's right. My book.

1:47:53.657 --> 1:47:58.094
My picture. My Gwynplaine.

1:48:00.431 --> 1:48:02.058
What about Betty Short?

1:48:03.300 --> 1:48:07.669
Well, that was
the cruelest joke of all.

1:48:11.809 --> 1:48:16.303
He was obsessed with her,
you know, that filthy film!

1:48:19.617 --> 1:48:22.017
<i>And your husband</i>
<i>bought her for Georgie.</i>

1:48:24.021 --> 1:48:26.581
He's a shy wee lad,
but I...

1:48:26.991 --> 1:48:30.392
It'd make him very happy,
I think, if you'd take him
out on a wee date.

1:48:30.628 --> 1:48:32.323
<i>What did you do,</i>
<i>Ramona?</i>

1:48:34.331 --> 1:48:36.822
<i>I was</i>

1:48:36.901 --> 1:48:40.928
<i>waiting up in Hollywoodland.</i>

1:48:41.472 --> 1:48:42.700
Oh, gosh.

1:49:01.725 --> 1:49:05.889
It was the second swing,

1:49:05.963 --> 1:49:07.555
woke her up.

1:49:08.966 --> 1:49:12.527
<i>She looked so like my Maddy.</i>

1:49:13.671 --> 1:49:14.831
<i>It was</i>

1:49:15.806 --> 1:49:20.641
<i>the cruelest joke of all.</i>

1:49:34.224 --> 1:49:36.556
We'll ruin you in court.
You know that.

1:49:36.627 --> 1:49:39.494
Over what? Some little slut?

1:49:56.213 --> 1:50:00.013
<i>It was</i>
<i>neat enough for the papers,</i>
<i>but that didn't make it clean.</i>

1:50:00.250 --> 1:50:04.016
<i>The rich lived differently.</i>
<i>I guess they get</i>
<i>to die differently, too.</i>

1:50:47.798 --> 1:50:49.527
Hello, Officer Bleichert.

1:50:51.001 --> 1:50:53.629
Did you come to pay your
respects or fuck my sister?

1:50:53.704 --> 1:50:56.195
I came to talk to you
about Lee Blanchard.

1:50:57.708 --> 1:51:01.337
He came here, didn't he?
Asking about your sister
and the Dahlia?

1:51:07.384 --> 1:51:08.612
Tell me.

1:51:26.704 --> 1:51:29.002
<i>Adios</i> yourself back
to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird.

1:51:29.073 --> 1:51:31.098
I've got business
with the lady.

1:51:43.287 --> 1:51:44.481
Bucky.

1:51:45.289 --> 1:51:48.122
Lee knew everything about you
and Elizabeth Short.

1:51:49.226 --> 1:51:50.784
He knew everything,
didn't he?

1:51:50.861 --> 1:51:52.954
I don't know
what you're saying.

1:51:53.997 --> 1:51:57.296
I went by your house today.
I talked to your sister,
Martha.

1:51:58.535 --> 1:52:01.766
She told me that a policeman
named Lee Blanchard came by
the house

1:52:01.839 --> 1:52:04.535
asking questions about
you and Elizabeth Short.

1:52:08.812 --> 1:52:11.576
She told him that
the two of you were close.

1:52:12.916 --> 1:52:15.316
Martha was always
jealous of me.

1:52:15.986 --> 1:52:17.476
He was blackmailing
your father.

1:52:27.865 --> 1:52:30.356
No. I beat up a wall.
For messing up Nash...

1:52:30.467 --> 1:52:31.729
So,

1:52:35.239 --> 1:52:37.730
on the night that
he went to the Olympic
to settle an old score

1:52:37.808 --> 1:52:41.471
<i>you tracked him there.</i>
<i>Like a dog.</i>

1:52:56.493 --> 1:52:59.553
I've been pointing my gun
at a lot of people this week.

1:53:00.964 --> 1:53:03.489
I haven't had a chance
to shoot anybody yet.

1:53:03.801 --> 1:53:05.530
What do you think?

1:53:05.602 --> 1:53:08.036
I think you'd rather fuck me
than kill me,

1:53:10.607 --> 1:53:13.075
but you don't have
the guts to do either.

1:53:16.647 --> 1:53:19.639
You're a boxer, not a fighter.

1:53:19.716 --> 1:53:21.240
You're a murderer.

1:53:22.553 --> 1:53:23.645
Of my partner.

1:53:23.720 --> 1:53:25.187
A murderer?

1:53:27.724 --> 1:53:29.453
Of Lee Blanchard?

1:53:33.931 --> 1:53:36.456
You should thank me
for Lee Blanchard.

1:53:37.367 --> 1:53:38.425
If it weren't for me,

1:53:38.502 --> 1:53:40.060
you wouldn't
have had the balls

1:53:40.137 --> 1:53:42.037
to fuck your partner's girl.

1:53:42.906 --> 1:53:44.931
You don't talk
about them, okay?

1:53:45.242 --> 1:53:49.542
Wait. I forgot.

1:53:53.016 --> 1:53:55.177
You don't fuck her anymore

1:53:58.322 --> 1:54:00.483
because you'd rather
fuck me.

1:54:01.625 --> 1:54:03.354
You don't talk about them.

1:54:05.095 --> 1:54:08.496
You chose me over her.

1:54:09.266 --> 1:54:12.326
You'll choose me over him.

1:54:14.838 --> 1:54:17.534
He was going to take
Daddy's money and leave,

1:54:18.909 --> 1:54:20.308
leave all of you.

1:54:31.855 --> 1:54:33.720
You'd never shoot me.

1:54:36.727 --> 1:54:38.888
Don't forget who I look like.

1:54:39.997 --> 1:54:42.625
Because that girl,

1:54:42.699 --> 1:54:46.760
that sad, dead bitch,

1:54:48.639 --> 1:54:50.732
she's all you have.

1:54:53.744 --> 1:54:54.836
No.

1:55:28.345 --> 1:55:31.576
<i>Madeleine was wrong.</i>
<i>I had others.</i>

1:55:33.383 --> 1:55:35.749
<i>Ones I'd loved</i>
<i>and ones who'd loved me.</i>

1:55:37.854 --> 1:55:42.223
<i>People I'd betrayed and people</i>
<i>I needed to protect.</i>

1:55:43.093 --> 1:55:45.186
<i>And, for the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

1:55:45.996 --> 1:55:49.727
<i>I had people that knew that,</i>
<i>for the briefest of times,</i>

1:55:50.701 --> 1:55:52.328
<i>in the darkest of places,</i>

1:55:52.402 --> 1:55:56.429
<i>I had been so,</i>
<i>so good at some things.</i>

1:56:36.279 --> 1:56:37.712
Come inside.
