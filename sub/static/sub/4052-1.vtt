00:49.258 --> 00:51.092
Go on, Barbara.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.681
We go back to our homeroom
for dismissal.

00:56.849 --> 00:59.851
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.688
Is that what you did
on the day in question?

01:05.357 --> 01:08.818
No. Mr. Gettys asked me
to stay after class.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.903
What happened next, Barbara?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.740
He told me to sit
in the chair beside his desk.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.199
Barbara.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.661
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened...

01:18.871 --> 01:20.872
in the next few minutes.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.875
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.879
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

01:28.046 --> 01:33.050
Then, before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

01:34.470 --> 01:38.014
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

01:38.223 --> 01:42.101
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.062
Then, with his hand...

01:45.230 --> 01:47.857
he started moving back and forth...

01:48.025 --> 01:50.818
farther and farther inside my skirt.

01:51.028 --> 01:54.363
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

01:54.573 --> 01:57.658
that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.870
I was trying to think of something to say,
but I couldn't.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.789
I was confused, and he just kept on.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.000
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.669
He just kept on with his hand.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.505
Then I screamed.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.133
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.552
Did he try again?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.346
Not with me.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.139
But with your friends?

02:20.307 --> 02:21.808
Yes.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.479
And after you had told them
what he had done to you...

02:27.648 --> 02:32.276
they told you
what he had done to them!

02:33.153 --> 02:34.362
Isn't that true?

02:34.530 --> 02:36.239
Yes.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.285
I have nothing further.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.415
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.550
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

02:55.717 --> 02:57.009
Of course.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.887
This court will be in recess
for 15 minutes.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.477
- Honey, what...?
- Not now, Bernice.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.901
Lomax, what's wrong?

03:14.069 --> 03:16.863
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.990
Why? What are you talking about?

03:19.157 --> 03:22.618
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.037
Hey, you're my lawyer.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.539
You're here to defend me.

03:26.707 --> 03:30.418
Know what I think? Why not put you on
the stand? You can jerk off for the judge.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.462
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.903
Well, hell, there you are.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.531
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.700
Not now, Larry.

04:02.868 --> 04:07.455
What's the game plan?
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.831
Give me a quote.

04:08.999 --> 04:10.041
Fuck off.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.797
Mr. Lomax had no comment
on today's events.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.716
Speculation, however, was widespread...

04:19.885 --> 04:23.888
that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories...

04:24.056 --> 04:25.598
would come to an end...

04:25.766 --> 04:27.975
in this courtroom.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.815
It was a nice run, Kev.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.193
Had to close out someday.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.570
Nobody wins them all.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.219
Have you had any discipline problems...

05:03.387 --> 05:05.262
in math class this year?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.889
No.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.225
No?

05:09.810 --> 05:13.521
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

05:13.689 --> 05:16.148
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.650
No.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.613
Have other teachers asked you
to stay after class?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.073
Once or twice.

05:24.241 --> 05:28.077
- Did they want to talk about your behavior?
- Objection. Immaterial.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.621
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.623
You may answer the question.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.792
I don't know
what the other teachers wanted.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.877
You'd have to talk to them.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.425
You ever pass notes in class, Barbara?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.720
Maybe a note that...

05:45.887 --> 05:47.263
made fun of Mr. Gettys?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.682
- No.
- No?

05:49.850 --> 05:53.436
Never called him
a disgusting pig monster?

05:55.355 --> 05:56.647
Order.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.608
No.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.278
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.

06:02.446 --> 06:06.115
Objection. We've had plenty of time
for discovery here.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.951
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.496
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits...

06:12.664 --> 06:15.791
you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.880
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.382
It's huge hog beast.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.469
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.763
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.058
- It's a joke.
- "He's a huge hog beast."

06:32.225 --> 06:35.728
He probably eats
a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

06:38.065 --> 06:40.066
You're writing about Mr. Gettys,
aren't you?

06:40.233 --> 06:43.194
It was meant to be a joke.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.698
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara...

06:47.866 --> 06:49.408
when your parents were away?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.744
Objection. Your Honor,
this is way out of line.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.371
- Credibility and bias.
- Overruled.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.665
Answer the question.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.043
Yes.

07:00.337 --> 07:04.048
Have you ever heard of a game
called "Special Places"?

07:05.801 --> 07:08.010
You're under oath, Barbara.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.096
A man's career...

07:10.263 --> 07:11.680
his reputation...

07:11.848 --> 07:15.392
his life is on the line.
This is not a joke.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.480
Have you ever played
the game "Special Places"?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.569
Yes.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.614
Is this game sexual in nature?

07:30.200 --> 07:33.619
Is this game sexual in nature?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.497
We only played it once.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.208
This special party, Barbara...

07:39.376 --> 07:44.338
this was the first time you told the
story about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

07:44.506 --> 07:45.673
Yes.

07:45.841 --> 07:49.260
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.429
Is there anything else
they may have told me about the party?

07:52.597 --> 07:56.058
Objection. If he has other witnesses,
let him call them.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.060
If I need to call
those other children, I will.

07:58.228 --> 08:01.063
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.399
Rephrase your question.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.489
You threatened those children,
didn't you?

08:10.699 --> 08:12.158
That's not the way it happened.

08:12.325 --> 08:16.495
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.205
These things did happen.

08:18.415 --> 08:23.210
If they didn't, you were going
to tell everyone about this special party.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.837
They happened to me.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.923
So you made up a story. A special story.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.633
A story about a math teacher...

08:29.801 --> 08:32.219
who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.054
A huge hog beast you didn't like!

08:35.222 --> 08:37.099
That's what really happened, isn't it?

08:37.308 --> 08:38.517
No.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.729
I didn't want to be the only one.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.691
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...

08:45.901 --> 08:48.068
You leave that girl alone,
that's enough.

08:49.613 --> 08:51.363
Bailiff, evict that man.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.240
No further questions, Your Honor.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.659
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.997
We'll be back here at 9:00 in the morning
and people will behave themselves...

09:00.207 --> 09:01.665
You made me proud.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.918
Or find themselves in contempt.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.169
Good evening.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.968
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.514
- You go, Gators.
- Yeah.

09:17.682 --> 09:22.353
In the event that we all get drunk,
let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.772
To the best trial lawyer
in Alachua County.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.982
Damn straight.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.526
So, Kev, off the record...

09:29.694 --> 09:32.238
how's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys...

09:32.447 --> 09:34.531
through the door of reasonable doubt?

09:34.741 --> 09:35.991
Larry.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.119
Why don't you quit being a party pooper?
Have yourself a drink.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.830
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.165
Am I right?

09:43.333 --> 09:44.917
I'll drink to that.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.004
No shop talk.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.260
- Pour me another.
- Hey, baby.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.011
Lomax, you're wild.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.597
I feel one of them nights coming on.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.102
I've seen the Eiffel Tower

10:03.270 --> 10:04.937
And I've seen the Taj Mahal

10:05.105 --> 10:08.649
And I've even been to China
And I've seen the Great Wall

10:08.817 --> 10:11.652
I've seen the Pacific Ocean
The Statue of Liberty

10:11.820 --> 10:13.529
I gotta go piss.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.364
- What?
- I gotta go piss.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.616
I gotta go piss!

10:18.118 --> 10:19.868
Okay.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.622
Hurry.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.625
Hey!

10:26.793 --> 10:28.627
Show me your tattoo

10:31.339 --> 10:34.216
Mr. Lomax. Hell of a job today.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.802
I don't want to disturb your party.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.185
"Milton, Chadwick, Waters."

10:45.645 --> 10:46.812
Never heard of it.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.440
What are you going to do? Sue me?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.776
Actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.154
We've been following your progress.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.573
From New York?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.491
You've never lost a case.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.703
I've had some sympathetic juries.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.164
That's exactly what we're looking for.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.417
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.299
I tell you, man...

11:15.467 --> 11:18.052
you're pretty damn good.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.054
Your card is great.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.556
And the black thing, you being black...

11:22.724 --> 11:24.641
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.143
That's just brilliant.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.021
I'm just not drunk enough yet
to fall for it.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.856
I'll buy you a drink when I...

11:31.066 --> 11:33.192
You'd have to start next week.

11:33.360 --> 11:37.905
All expenses, first-class travel
and lodging, you and your wife.

11:38.073 --> 11:42.576
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

11:43.244 --> 11:44.870
Well, hey.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.997
Take a look.

11:47.165 --> 11:52.086
Please, baby, baby, please

11:52.253 --> 11:56.298
Please, show me your tattoo

11:58.343 --> 12:00.219
Baby

12:06.393 --> 12:08.102
In the name of Lord Jesus...

12:08.269 --> 12:11.939
we refute you, Satan, and cast you out
and go forth with the zeal of the Lord.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.190
Amen.

12:13.358 --> 12:16.235
Romans 16:19 says!

12:16.403 --> 12:20.447
Be excellent in what is good

12:20.615 --> 12:24.618
Be innocent of evil

12:24.786 --> 12:28.622
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan

12:28.790 --> 12:32.292
God will crush him
Underneath your feet

12:32.460 --> 12:37.256
And the God of Peace
Will soon crush Satan

12:37.424 --> 12:40.342
God will crush him
Underneath your feet

12:40.510 --> 12:43.110
Romans 16:19 says

12:52.981 --> 12:55.858
All the way to New York
just to pick a jury?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.985
Every dog gets his day.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.906
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

13:04.492 --> 13:07.786
I gotta tell you, Ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.746
Working on Sunday.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.499
Working? Ma, get over it.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.670
Ma. Listen to me. I love my wife.

13:17.088 --> 13:20.007
Okay? I love her all the way.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.508
Just like you.

13:22.844 --> 13:26.180
- Let me tell you about New York.
- Let me guess.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.098
Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.185
It has become
a dwelling place of demons.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.811
Revelation 18.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.147
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.233
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

13:39.194 --> 13:41.403
And what happened to Babylon?

13:42.697 --> 13:46.241
Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgment come.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.953
And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.790
Wish me luck.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.461
Good luck.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.923
I'll miss you.

14:01.299 --> 14:05.219
No. Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.137
I'm trying to work with you.

14:07.347 --> 14:12.142
They'll be looking for that payment and
if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.563
Yeah.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.235
Okay, I gotta go.

14:24.322 --> 14:28.992
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.870
Okay. Make the payment.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.628
- Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?
- Yep.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.131
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.758
What do you say?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.595
Let her sweat a little.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.713
Do you think, as a juror...

15:22.880 --> 15:26.049
you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold...

15:26.259 --> 15:28.594
about the savings-and-loan industry?

15:29.554 --> 15:30.971
That was a question, sir.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.348
What? Do I like bankers?

15:39.397 --> 15:42.232
Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

15:42.442 --> 15:43.567
You may.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.779
Dump him.

15:47.989 --> 15:51.617
Let's get rid of Number 4, 6,
and I'd say lose Number 12...

15:51.784 --> 15:54.161
but the prosecutor will fuck up
and do it for us.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.829
Number 6?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.293
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.961
She's my first pass.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.921
And 4?

16:08.009 --> 16:10.761
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.514
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

16:15.391 --> 16:19.728
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.106
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

16:23.316 --> 16:27.653
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.908
He looks like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

16:33.076 --> 16:36.036
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.913
Number 6...

16:38.081 --> 16:39.581
your favorite...

16:39.791 --> 16:41.917
she's damaged goods.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.295
She's a Catholic schoolteacher, hmm?

16:45.463 --> 16:47.214
Believes in human frailty...

16:47.423 --> 16:49.758
No. Something's missing from her.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.468
She's wrong.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.595
She wants on this jury.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.598
Somebody hurt her
and she wants revenge.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.852
How the hell do you know that?

17:01.771 --> 17:02.979
I don't know.

17:04.732 --> 17:08.652
Either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.612
Walk.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.910
Here's the deal: If I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.079
Your Honor, may I continue?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.749
We'd like to excuse
Jurors 3, 4 and 6.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.220
Hi. You're home early for a change.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.264
I just happened to find out...

18:19.432 --> 18:21.683
I was pregnant on the same day
that I got the show.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.351
Your mother called.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.354
She has her bad feeling.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.986
Every now and then, she gets one right.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.824
You okay?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.828
Something's up.

18:41.996 --> 18:45.165
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.711
Kevin.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.963
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.845
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.265
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.392
Yeah.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.395
Except one.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.105
What?

19:11.734 --> 19:12.943
Kev.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.404
Not fucking guilty!

19:16.572 --> 19:20.242
- Oh, my God. You lying sack of shit.
- Ha, ha.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.327
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.913
Yes!

19:25.081 --> 19:27.457
Thirty-eight minutes.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.752
- You did it!
- My jury. I'm too good.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.258
- Glad you could stick around.
- It's your dime.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.676
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:37.885 --> 19:41.137
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.473
Good morning, Caprice.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.183
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.643
Your messages.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.607
Not bad?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.693
You can play it cool if you want...

19:54.861 --> 19:57.863
but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

19:59.866 --> 20:00.907
Thank you.

20:01.242 --> 20:04.327
This is our home office.
We have many international arrangements...

20:04.495 --> 20:07.497
so Mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.500
- Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.
- Am I good cop or bad cop?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.168
We may not need a good cop.

20:12.378 --> 20:13.920
Oh, I love it.

20:14.088 --> 20:18.133
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

20:18.342 --> 20:21.303
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...

20:21.512 --> 20:24.514
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.695
Behind you.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.323
I'm sorry.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.909
Please. Kevin Lomax.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.328
- John Milton.
- Nice to meet you.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.669
So?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.712
Have we been treating you well?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.297
Very well, thank you.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.466
And your wife, she had a good time?

21:41.634 --> 21:45.637
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

21:47.598 --> 21:48.682
That's our secret:

21:48.849 --> 21:50.475
Kill you with kindness.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.313
What's your secret?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.482
I couldn't say.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.942
You were a prosecutor.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.862
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville DA's office.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.617
Sixty-four straight convictions.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.704
What a number.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.622
I like to be in court.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.833
I didn't plea out a lot.

22:15.418 --> 22:16.459
What's that like?

22:16.627 --> 22:19.129
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.465
Takes a little getting used to.

22:22.633 --> 22:26.011
- Pays better, though, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

22:27.221 --> 22:32.642
That math teacher, the Gettys case.
Now, I hear you were brilliant.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.310
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.104
Really?

22:36.355 --> 22:37.939
You think your guy was guilty?

22:38.149 --> 22:39.190
I didn't say that.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.775
What'd you say?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.653
How's this:

22:43.821 --> 22:47.032
I began the case with a clear conscience.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.915
I was sure you had a secret.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.129
The men's room.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.798
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.593
There's a hole in the wall
to the next room.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.220
I spent five years listening
to juries deliberate.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.598
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

23:11.766 --> 23:13.058
Just don't repeat it.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.269
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

23:16.437 --> 23:18.688
My lips are sealed.

23:18.856 --> 23:22.275
You don't really want to go back
to Florida, do you?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.073
Walk with me.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.011
What do you think?

23:50.763 --> 23:53.014
Some people can't handle it.

23:54.308 --> 23:56.017
It's peaceful.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.062
My sentiments exactly.

23:59.230 --> 24:05.110
Ha, ha. So fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me... your father, what does he do?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.905
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.491
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.411
- She never remarried?
- She wasn't married the first time.

24:15.579 --> 24:19.624
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.252
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.505
Holy shit.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.716
Different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.802
Yes, it is.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.138
Oh, my God.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.722
Your mother...

24:34.890 --> 24:36.641
what's she like?

24:36.809 --> 24:39.853
She's a preacher's daughter.
She's tough.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.648
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.527
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.571
They do a lot of volunteer work.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.449
Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.703
So they say.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.288
It didn't rub off?

24:58.455 --> 25:00.331
The Book? The Church?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.125
No, I'm on parole.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.587
Early release for time served.

25:08.382 --> 25:11.050
A lot of potential clients down there.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.719
Are we negotiating?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.096
Always.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.892
Can I ask you a question, then?

25:19.268 --> 25:22.103
Why do you need a criminal department?

25:22.271 --> 25:26.649
Our clients break the law
like anyone else.

25:29.403 --> 25:33.198
I'm just tired of sending their business
across the street.

25:33.365 --> 25:37.035
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.956
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

25:42.124 --> 25:45.460
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.838
What thing is that?

25:49.840 --> 25:50.965
Pressure.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.385
It changes everything. Pressure.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.931
Some people, you squeeze them,
they focus.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.225
Others fold.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.562
Can you summon your talent at will?

26:04.939 --> 26:07.440
Can you deliver on a deadline?

26:08.108 --> 26:09.943
Can you sleep at night?

26:11.695 --> 26:13.321
When do we talk about money?

26:13.489 --> 26:14.530
Money?

26:16.867 --> 26:18.368
Yeah.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.453
That's the easy part.

26:21.163 --> 26:23.623
They call this part of Fifth Avenue,
Carnegie Hill.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.376
Got the park right across the street,
and the reservoir.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.754
Best jogging in New York.
Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.090
Some excellent schools.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.385
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

26:35.552 --> 26:37.553
but great neighborhood
for children.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.014
Great building.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.642
Follow the money all the way to the top.

26:42.851 --> 26:46.145
You got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.774
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.404
- You must be Mary Ann.
- Yes, I am.

26:54.571 --> 26:57.448
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

26:57.908 --> 26:59.826
It's nice of you to come by.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.161
Oh, please. We live across the hall.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.539
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.666
It's just two apartments per floor?

27:06.834 --> 27:10.795
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.631
Voilà.

27:19.054 --> 27:21.097
Oh, my God.

27:22.016 --> 27:24.309
It's what they call a Classic Eight.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.312
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

27:27.479 --> 27:31.691
We had them paint it white. Let you see it
naked before you pick your palette.

27:31.859 --> 27:32.942
What am I picking?

27:33.110 --> 27:34.444
Palette. Your colors.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.279
Oh, yes.

27:38.198 --> 27:40.241
I need to warn you about one thing.

27:40.409 --> 27:44.495
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.166
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.626
You must've made quite an impression.

27:50.794 --> 27:54.714
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

27:54.882 --> 27:56.215
Babies.

27:56.383 --> 28:00.511
- It took us six years to get in here.
- Oh, wow.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.141
Unbelievable.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.643
- Thank you very much.
- Jackie.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.479
Kevin.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.692
Are you really this good?

28:15.444 --> 28:16.611
I sure as hell hope so.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.239
They must want you pretty bad.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.868
Look, Mar...

28:24.328 --> 28:27.497
I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.665
If you want to go home...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.542
I'm with you.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.211
Sure.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.714
Let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.843
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

28:41.011 --> 28:44.764
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves...

28:44.932 --> 28:50.103
in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.897
Are you shitting me?

28:58.612 --> 28:59.862
I love you.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.198
I love you too.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.829
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.498
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.125
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.043
I run the Islamic subgroup.

29:14.211 --> 29:17.171
Joyce Rensaleer,
Mergers and Acquisitions.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.841
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director...

29:20.676 --> 29:21.926
and Real Estate.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.096
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.391
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...

29:28.559 --> 29:30.852
EC and G7.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.313
There it is, Kevin.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.149
The whole team.

29:36.316 --> 29:39.360
Welcome to Milton,
Chadwick and Waters.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.488
So, what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.157
I guess it'll do.

29:44.324 --> 29:45.992
Until something better comes along?

29:46.160 --> 29:47.910
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.787
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

29:49.997 --> 29:52.248
Pam was at the Brooklyn DA's office
14 years...

29:52.416 --> 29:54.876
so she knows her way
around the local scene.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.170
You'll expedite his bar application?

29:57.379 --> 30:00.465
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work pro hac vice.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.176
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

30:03.343 --> 30:07.430
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

30:07.598 --> 30:08.848
The Moyez case?

30:10.434 --> 30:11.976
Move, move, move!

30:33.874 --> 30:35.041
What do you think?

30:35.209 --> 30:38.002
It's a health-code case and it's a loser.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.672
So, what's the point?

30:41.840 --> 30:46.093
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

30:46.261 --> 30:48.221
Isn't everything?

30:49.932 --> 30:52.600
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

30:52.768 --> 30:56.687
with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.523
Lovely, isn't it?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.485
And this is about what?

31:02.653 --> 31:04.237
The price?

31:04.404 --> 31:07.949
Oh, it's about 2000 a panel.

31:08.116 --> 31:11.494
We'll take it. At 1400.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.746
You made it.

31:13.914 --> 31:15.373
Hey, baby.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.458
I thought you said it was impossible.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.336
I thought you said it was important.

31:26.426 --> 31:27.552
Go get them.

31:27.761 --> 31:29.512
Go get them, man.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.098
Tell him, "Cut that shit down."

31:32.266 --> 31:36.185
I know what they're doing over there.
That's right.

31:36.353 --> 31:40.147
Tell him, "Take all that noise
back to Africa."

31:49.241 --> 31:53.536
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Philippe Moyez.

32:04.715 --> 32:07.216
Look, I'm not sure
I'm making myself clear.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.970
Moyez, you need him?
To speak with him?

32:11.138 --> 32:13.055
Show him your boots.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.810
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

32:18.395 --> 32:19.437
In the dark?

32:19.646 --> 32:22.773
Where do you think I'm taking you?
Ha, ha.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.619
I thought I would recognize you...

32:36.204 --> 32:37.913
but I do not.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.083
Mr. Moyez?

32:42.669 --> 32:44.503
We've never met.

32:44.838 --> 32:47.840
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

32:48.342 --> 32:50.801
I'm here about the animals.

32:51.928 --> 32:55.806
We have an investment in blood.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.976
Think of it as spiritual currency.

33:00.771 --> 33:03.314
Spiritual currency.

33:04.858 --> 33:08.027
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.117
What is the name of the man...

33:15.327 --> 33:17.995
who will prosecute us?

33:18.163 --> 33:19.664
Merto.

33:19.831 --> 33:23.376
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.049
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

33:30.217 --> 33:33.427
With this tongue, we create silence.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.137
You can go now.

33:35.305 --> 33:37.056
You will have all the help...

33:37.224 --> 33:39.266
I can give you...

33:39.434 --> 33:41.477
against Monsieur Merto.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.696
It's arbor green. What do you think?

33:52.823 --> 33:55.074
Not with your complexion.

33:59.413 --> 34:01.205
New York City health codes.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.792
- That's all of it?
- Not quite.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.840
Thanks.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.303
Caribbean green.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.306
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

34:19.474 --> 34:21.308
A cooler green.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.272
Too institutional.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.190
I love green.

34:28.358 --> 34:33.487
I love it but it's one thing to wear it
and another to have it on your walls.

34:35.782 --> 34:40.077
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.958
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.543
Good night.

35:06.938 --> 35:11.817
This is the first time since I've
been 13 years old I don't have a job...

35:11.985 --> 35:13.694
or two.

35:13.862 --> 35:16.489
I feel like I'm floating around
in that place.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.241
You know, just drifting around
or something.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.204
You'll settle in.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.081
We had this little office in the condo...

35:26.249 --> 35:27.374
- Thanks.
- Mm-hm.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.670
You know, his side and my side.
Real nice.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.758
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...

35:37.803 --> 35:39.970
If I want to see Leamon...

35:40.138 --> 35:41.889
I make an appointment.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.356
You're kidding, right?

35:53.944 --> 35:55.903
God, how do you handle it?

35:56.071 --> 35:58.364
Take a look around, honey.

35:58.532 --> 36:01.242
Look, you've got three choices.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.494
The Holy Trinity:

36:03.662 --> 36:05.746
You can work...

36:06.373 --> 36:08.290
you can play...

36:09.125 --> 36:10.793
or you can breed.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.171
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.424
USDA approved and stamped.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.511
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.639
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.016
He killed a goat.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.519
And he did it at home...

36:28.687 --> 36:32.815
in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.734
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

36:37.112 --> 36:40.739
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

36:40.907 --> 36:42.825
It's not as common as, say...

36:42.993 --> 36:44.577
circumcision.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.954
It's not as common as the belief that...

36:47.122 --> 36:50.207
wine transforms into blood.

36:50.375 --> 36:54.545
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.256
Some people walk on fire.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.216
Philippe Moyez killed a goat.

36:59.384 --> 37:01.051
And he did it...

37:01.303 --> 37:05.180
while observing
his constitutionally protected...

37:05.348 --> 37:06.390
religious beliefs.

37:08.351 --> 37:12.062
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats...

37:12.230 --> 37:15.649
or transporting goats or goat licensing.

37:15.817 --> 37:19.653
The city was less concerned
with the care of the animals...

37:19.821 --> 37:22.197
than the manner with which
they were slaughtered.

37:22.365 --> 37:23.657
Objection!

37:23.825 --> 37:26.493
Okay. Enough, enough. I got it.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.203
Let's wrap it up.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.997
Your Honor...

37:30.540 --> 37:33.334
the city timed this police action
to catch my client...

37:33.543 --> 37:38.088
exercising his constitutionally
protected right to religious freedom.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.716
This is a law protecting
kosher butchering.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.426
Exactly, Your Honor.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.971
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.808
I happen to know a little bit
about kashruth law, Mr. Lomax.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.644
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

37:51.811 --> 37:55.272
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.232
Mr. Merto?

37:59.736 --> 38:02.738
- Your Honor...
- Mr. Merto.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.699
For God's sake, man...

38:13.833 --> 38:16.543
- Congratulations. Great job.
- Thanks.

38:16.711 --> 38:20.381
Bravo! Bravo!

38:20.548 --> 38:22.967
Pamela, you look lovely.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.176
So, Philippe...

38:24.344 --> 38:25.511
satisfied?

38:25.679 --> 38:27.596
Always, Jean.

38:27.764 --> 38:28.847
Kevin.

38:29.057 --> 38:30.933
What can I say?

38:32.018 --> 38:34.311
Outstanding.

38:34.479 --> 38:37.439
Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...

38:37.607 --> 38:39.942
living in some subterranean shithole...

38:40.151 --> 38:44.029
all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.614
You're kidding.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.200
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

38:48.410 --> 38:52.371
Tarzan, we're billing you out
at 400 an hour, my friend.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.916
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

38:56.084 --> 38:59.044
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.

38:59.254 --> 39:01.046
Maybe I did.

39:01.214 --> 39:04.591
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

39:04.801 --> 39:07.636
don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.888
You've gotta keep yourself small.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.181
Innocuous.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.808
Be the little guy.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.227
You know, the nerd, the leper...

39:15.395 --> 39:18.397
the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

39:20.233 --> 39:22.943
Underestimated from day one.

39:23.403 --> 39:26.864
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

39:27.866 --> 39:30.784
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

39:30.994 --> 39:32.161
What's that?

39:32.620 --> 39:34.246
It's the look.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.207
That Florida stud thing. What is that?

39:37.375 --> 39:40.210
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

39:41.588 --> 39:43.589
Never worked a jury that didn't have
a woman.

39:43.757 --> 39:45.340
You know what you're missing?

39:45.508 --> 39:47.593
You're missing what I have.

39:48.053 --> 39:52.347
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday...

39:52.515 --> 39:56.101
we're done, she's walking
to the bathroom, trying to walk...

39:56.269 --> 39:57.853
she turns...

39:58.021 --> 39:59.646
she looks...

39:59.814 --> 40:01.607
it's me.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.194
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.863
She gets this look on her face like:

40:08.031 --> 40:10.199
"How the hell did that happen?"

40:12.368 --> 40:15.412
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.998
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.125
They don't see me coming.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.794
That's what you're missing.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.213
- Where's the chicken?
- What?

40:36.309 --> 40:38.811
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe...

40:38.978 --> 40:41.772
never loses. He's famous.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.734
Never loses, like you.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.319
Tic-tac-toe.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.655
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.699
Learn the subways, Kevin.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.535
Use them.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.745
Stay in the trenches.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.164
Only way I travel.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.168
Mar?

41:06.506 --> 41:08.715
What happened to the green?

41:08.883 --> 41:10.717
- I loved the green.
- Honey, you're late.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.846
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.514
What's all this?

41:15.682 --> 41:16.765
All what?

41:16.933 --> 41:20.602
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

41:20.770 --> 41:23.814
- All this?
- Oh, that.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.816
It was going to be a nursery...

41:25.984 --> 41:29.319
then I remembered you'd have to be
home long enough to knock me up.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.698
So now I'm thinking of building
a law library.

41:32.866 --> 41:35.117
Oh, baby.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.454
Oh, tell me I can handle this.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.206
You can handle this.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.834
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

41:47.463 --> 41:50.799
Promise me you won't
leave me alone in there.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.843
I promise.

41:53.469 --> 41:54.511
Mm.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.184
There you are.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.603
Hi.

42:03.313 --> 42:05.314
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.191
Nice to meet you, sorry we're late.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.360
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

42:10.570 --> 42:11.612
All hail.

42:11.821 --> 42:15.282
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.784
Well, Kevin, here they are.

42:17.952 --> 42:21.788
Top of the food chain
and dinner is served.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.582
I throw these parties twice a year.

42:23.750 --> 42:28.503
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're
all players, and they're all prospects.

42:28.671 --> 42:32.216
Kevin, congratulations.
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

42:32.425 --> 42:33.550
Congratulations.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.136
Bright young lights.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.389
Oh, oh, you're going to like this.
Come on.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.808
Somebody I want you to meet.

42:42.018 --> 42:45.604
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.231
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.567
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.320
Barzoon always overstates things.

42:53.488 --> 42:56.698
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

42:56.866 --> 42:58.033
Probably Mort Zuckerman.

42:58.201 --> 43:01.036
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.621
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

43:02.789 --> 43:04.665
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.125
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

43:07.293 --> 43:09.002
Excuse me. This is important.

43:09.170 --> 43:12.464
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.967
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

43:15.134 --> 43:16.760
- I was married to him.
- Oh, really?

43:16.928 --> 43:17.970
Kidding.

43:21.891 --> 43:24.476
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.603
- He's new to the firm.
- Nice to meet you.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.648
The senator cannot leave.

43:29.816 --> 43:31.984
Who's that with the senator?

43:32.819 --> 43:35.237
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

43:35.446 --> 43:37.072
No, who is he?

43:37.240 --> 43:39.533
I swear he can hear us.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.618
Hell, he can smell us.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.912
Mary Ann...

43:44.080 --> 43:45.372
John Milton.

43:45.540 --> 43:48.667
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

43:48.835 --> 43:51.003
Already swimming with the sharks.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.088
Careful, hon.

43:53.256 --> 43:57.592
Harry, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.428
These parties don't come cheap.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.306
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

44:02.515 --> 44:05.225
Just get it on tape.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.687
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

44:08.855 --> 44:13.150
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

44:13.318 --> 44:15.360
buys a few new suits...

44:16.195 --> 44:18.280
learns a few new tricks...

44:18.448 --> 44:19.740
he's there.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.450
It's you. What about you?

44:21.617 --> 44:25.203
Your family, you've got to miss them.
No?

44:26.289 --> 44:31.209
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.670
I can relate.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.673
I can, believe me.

44:37.759 --> 44:39.843
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

44:45.391 --> 44:47.851
The worst vice is advice.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.148
But may I make a suggestion?

44:53.316 --> 44:56.026
It's a sensitive...

44:57.278 --> 45:00.238
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.824
No, go ahead.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.952
- I mean, you don't like it?
- No.

45:06.162 --> 45:08.789
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.832
It's just...

45:11.667 --> 45:13.835
It doesn't belong to you.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.588
You're too alive for a perm.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.423
It's not you.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.093
You should pull your hair back.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.472
Do it. See what happens.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.183
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

45:28.351 --> 45:30.268
- Is that so terrible?
- Ha, ha.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.521
I'd love to do it, but if I did...

45:32.688 --> 45:35.732
everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us...

45:35.900 --> 45:39.945
would naturally assume
we were fucking or something.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.449
Please.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.205
Okay.

46:00.007 --> 46:02.759
It's fun to be right.

46:05.054 --> 46:06.555
Excuse me.

46:08.724 --> 46:10.142
It's a vision.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.646
You've gotta cut your hair.

46:17.358 --> 46:18.483
Are you serious?

46:18.651 --> 46:23.697
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.575
And her neck...

46:28.161 --> 46:30.162
if she's alive...

46:31.622 --> 46:34.499
has all the mystery of a border town.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.920
A no man's land...

46:40.631 --> 46:42.090
in that battle...

46:42.300 --> 46:45.510
between the mind and the body.

46:46.721 --> 46:47.888
You know...

46:49.098 --> 46:51.224
your natural color would really...

46:51.434 --> 46:53.852
bring out your eyes.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.702
Do you have this view?

47:10.870 --> 47:12.078
Sorry?

47:12.747 --> 47:14.456
From your terrace,
do you have this view?

47:15.917 --> 47:17.834
Not exactly.

47:18.002 --> 47:20.378
No terrace and I'm about...

47:20.546 --> 47:22.631
12 floors down.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.508
What about you?

47:25.218 --> 47:27.385
No, I live downtown.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.471
This is a...

47:29.639 --> 47:30.764
family building.

47:32.183 --> 47:34.226
Sounds like fun.

47:35.770 --> 47:37.729
Downtown, I mean.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.398
I'm just getting to know the city.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.817
Is it everything you expected?

47:43.402 --> 47:44.444
More.

47:44.612 --> 47:47.739
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

47:49.492 --> 47:50.534
Excuse me, Jackie.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.035
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

47:52.245 --> 47:54.704
No. I'm sure he's around.

47:54.872 --> 47:56.873
Okay, thanks.

47:57.041 --> 47:59.042
Are you alone?

48:02.171 --> 48:04.005
You mean, tonight?

48:06.133 --> 48:08.552
Is your wife a jealous woman,
Mr. Lomax?

48:14.559 --> 48:17.644
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

48:17.812 --> 48:19.771
No. No, really...

48:19.981 --> 48:21.189
I'm fine.

48:21.357 --> 48:22.941
- Yeah?
- I'm fine.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.609
Bet you like to be on top.

48:24.819 --> 48:27.529
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

48:27.697 --> 48:29.781
Of the situation.

48:29.949 --> 48:33.285
You prefer to be on top, right?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.371
Depends on the view.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.792
You know what I see?

48:42.336 --> 48:44.379
I see the future...

48:44.547 --> 48:46.339
of this law firm.

49:03.441 --> 49:06.192
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

49:06.360 --> 49:10.405
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.992
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.619
Quickly.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.706
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

49:19.874 --> 49:22.083
We'll plant a story
and destroy his credibility.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.793
Pam, have you seen Kevin?

49:23.961 --> 49:26.713
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

49:26.881 --> 49:29.883
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.

49:50.571 --> 49:51.696
Come on.

50:03.417 --> 50:04.918
Is there more to it?

50:06.003 --> 50:07.837
Just this room.

50:08.673 --> 50:10.924
And a bedroom?

50:11.092 --> 50:13.802
Nope. No bedroom.

50:13.969 --> 50:16.471
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

50:16.639 --> 50:17.722
Where does he fuck?

50:17.890 --> 50:19.849
Everywhere.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.019
What's up, John?

50:23.187 --> 50:26.564
Leamon, how many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

50:28.943 --> 50:31.194
16,242.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.196
What did he do now?

50:33.364 --> 50:37.784
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

50:37.952 --> 50:39.619
her stepson...

50:39.787 --> 50:41.287
and a maid.

50:43.457 --> 50:44.749
When did this happen?

50:44.917 --> 50:46.626
Just now. Tonight.

50:46.794 --> 50:49.921
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

50:50.089 --> 50:52.298
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

50:52.466 --> 50:55.093
They're gonna line up. I gotta call Meisel.

50:55.261 --> 50:58.221
No, no, no.
I want Kevin on this case.

51:00.057 --> 51:01.516
I hope you're kidding.

51:05.396 --> 51:10.191
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

51:10.359 --> 51:12.527
Ha! You're dreaming.

51:14.989 --> 51:17.365
You know, I've shaken hands...

51:17.533 --> 51:20.952
with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

51:21.120 --> 51:24.247
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

51:24.415 --> 51:27.584
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

51:27.752 --> 51:32.547
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.841
I want you on board, Eddie.

51:35.801 --> 51:41.139
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

51:41.307 --> 51:44.309
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.811
He's a business client.

51:46.979 --> 51:49.063
We know him better
than he knows himself.

51:49.231 --> 51:51.232
We've got the inside track.

51:51.400 --> 51:55.612
We've got the best damn trial lawyer
in the city. It's ours to lose.

51:56.614 --> 51:57.822
Well.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.908
Tell that to Cullen.

52:00.743 --> 52:02.327
I want Kevin to tell him.

52:03.704 --> 52:05.330
There's Pam.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.084
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

52:18.052 --> 52:19.719
Pam?

52:19.887 --> 52:21.095
No, it's Kevin.

52:22.473 --> 52:26.100
Hi. No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.769
Where are we at?

52:34.944 --> 52:37.070
You left me there.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.949
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

52:43.077 --> 52:45.203
Three hours, you don't even call?

52:45.371 --> 52:46.746
Stop.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.289
Reset.

52:48.457 --> 52:52.126
I'm upstairs. I'm with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

52:52.294 --> 52:56.381
There's a good possibility I'm about
to catch a triple-homicide defendant...

52:56.549 --> 52:57.924
who also happens to be...

52:58.092 --> 53:01.761
one of the largest real-estate
developers in this city.

53:02.429 --> 53:04.556
Mar, I had to bail on the party.

53:04.723 --> 53:07.433
You bailed on me.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.477
Mar.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.689
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.357
For three whole hours.

53:14.525 --> 53:17.360
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.028
You gotta be kidding me, right?

53:19.196 --> 53:22.490
Go to hell. And you can
go to sleep on the fucking couch!

53:26.036 --> 53:29.247
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

53:29.415 --> 53:30.623
Look at this.

53:30.833 --> 53:34.544
I'm not out 20 minutes,
and I'm being followed by the press.

53:34.712 --> 53:35.753
They're like insects.

53:35.921 --> 53:39.090
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?

53:40.634 --> 53:45.388
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ.

53:45.556 --> 53:47.390
This is my ass we're talking about, John.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.600
Eddie?

53:48.767 --> 53:52.645
Alex, you know how this town works.

53:54.315 --> 53:57.775
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

53:58.694 --> 54:00.445
Now, with this...

54:00.613 --> 54:02.530
now that you're down...

54:02.698 --> 54:04.407
I'd get ready for one of those...

54:04.575 --> 54:07.702
Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

54:07.870 --> 54:09.203
You know what's coming.

54:09.371 --> 54:12.248
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
who do you trust?

54:12.416 --> 54:13.958
Who do you trust, Alex?

54:14.126 --> 54:15.293
I don't know.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.295
I'm gonna have to look around.

54:21.008 --> 54:23.301
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

54:23.469 --> 54:27.180
Jury selection started today
at every breakfast table in the city.

54:27.348 --> 54:29.265
This is what people know:

54:29.433 --> 54:31.601
Three dead bodies.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.311
You discover the crime.

54:33.479 --> 54:37.857
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.818
And, Mr. Cullen...

54:42.029 --> 54:43.863
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

54:44.031 --> 54:45.615
How do you know that?

54:45.783 --> 54:48.576
There's a second print in blood.

54:48.744 --> 54:52.080
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

54:52.289 --> 54:56.417
I have keys. I called the cops from
the house. I touched the goddamn wall.

54:56.585 --> 54:58.127
I panicked. I was panicked.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.338
We need 12 people
who can see past all that.

55:00.506 --> 55:03.508
- I touched the goddamn wall.
- I'd get in front of this fast.

55:03.676 --> 55:06.469
I panicked. Is that a crime?

55:06.637 --> 55:08.888
I didn't kill anybody.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.183
This is a nightmare.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.812
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

55:17.189 --> 55:18.898
He's right, Alex.

55:19.066 --> 55:20.483
People need to hear these things.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.027
Christ, Eddie. Jesus.

55:23.195 --> 55:26.739
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

55:26.907 --> 55:28.533
We'll move over.

55:28.701 --> 55:30.952
But right now, this moment...

55:31.120 --> 55:33.579
you need immediate representation.

55:33.789 --> 55:35.665
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

55:35.874 --> 55:38.418
who I care more about
than anything in this world.

55:38.627 --> 55:41.421
They wouldn't let me talk to her
from downtown.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.798
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out.

55:43.966 --> 55:47.385
We need to issue a statement.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.722
He's a winner, Alex.

55:50.889 --> 55:52.473
Just like you were.

55:52.641 --> 55:55.393
And they'll never see him coming.

55:56.895 --> 55:59.230
Jesus Christ.

56:01.900 --> 56:05.778
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...

56:09.283 --> 56:10.616
All right.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.704
My place, tomorrow.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.330
Alone.

56:20.085 --> 56:24.172
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.516
Not if they were giving it away.

56:35.684 --> 56:38.811
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

56:39.646 --> 56:40.855
- Andrea?
- Yes?

56:41.023 --> 56:42.398
Another one of these, please.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.733
Right away.

56:43.901 --> 56:46.778
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes...

56:46.945 --> 56:49.614
I want you loose and pliable
this afternoon.

56:49.782 --> 56:52.784
Get another bottle of chardonnay
for Mrs. Barzoon and Mrs. Heath.

56:52.951 --> 56:55.953
Oh, Lord, this is $3000.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.705
You know what you should do?

56:57.873 --> 56:59.665
You should buy it...

56:59.833 --> 57:02.543
wear it once, and then throw it away.

57:02.711 --> 57:04.504
That will loosen you up.

57:06.048 --> 57:08.299
I say spend it all.

57:08.467 --> 57:12.095
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.138
- Ha, ha.
- I swear...

57:14.306 --> 57:18.726
if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off...

57:18.894 --> 57:21.604
he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

57:21.772 --> 57:23.815
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

57:23.982 --> 57:26.651
he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

57:26.819 --> 57:28.402
Who does it better than that?

57:28.612 --> 57:31.030
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

57:33.325 --> 57:35.201
Not too big...

57:35.869 --> 57:37.328
Perfect.

57:38.914 --> 57:40.414
Real or not?

57:42.417 --> 57:43.459
They look real.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.337
They must be real.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.006
Feel them.

57:49.174 --> 57:50.716
Oh, no, it's okay, really.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.636
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

57:55.347 --> 57:56.389
Oh.

57:57.349 --> 57:58.432
Feel real?

57:58.600 --> 57:59.892
Yes, absolutely real.

58:01.436 --> 58:02.854
Dr. Robert.

58:06.150 --> 58:07.859
When you're ready.

58:27.546 --> 58:28.588
Oh, God.

58:30.632 --> 58:33.926
So, what do you think?

58:36.138 --> 58:37.889
I don't care if they can hear me.

58:38.056 --> 58:40.850
I don't care!

58:41.018 --> 58:43.603
I don't like it here, Kevin.

58:43.770 --> 58:47.023
And these women. My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake.

58:47.191 --> 58:49.317
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

58:49.484 --> 58:50.985
- Calm down.
- No!

58:51.153 --> 58:52.653
- Listen to me. Mar.
- No!

58:52.863 --> 58:54.030
Mar!

58:54.198 --> 58:55.865
First...

58:57.201 --> 58:58.868
You do this radical thing to your hair.

58:59.036 --> 59:01.037
Oh, you hate it.

59:01.246 --> 59:02.914
Stop. I think it's fine.

59:03.081 --> 59:06.876
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

59:08.712 --> 59:11.714
You've got the pressure of fitting in
with new friends.

59:11.882 --> 59:13.841
A new place.

59:14.092 --> 59:16.844
- Add to that a couple bottles of wine.
- No.

59:17.012 --> 59:20.223
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

59:20.390 --> 59:23.851
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy...

59:24.019 --> 59:25.186
or anything like that.

59:25.354 --> 59:27.772
Because I know
that's what you're gonna say.

59:28.315 --> 59:29.690
What about Kathy?

59:29.858 --> 59:31.609
What about your sister?

59:31.777 --> 59:34.779
- What about her? She's pregnant again.
- Oh.

59:34.947 --> 59:37.615
That's got nothing to do with this?

59:40.452 --> 59:43.454
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

59:43.872 --> 59:48.209
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

59:48.543 --> 59:49.710
If you can believe it...

59:49.878 --> 59:53.089
I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

59:54.091 --> 59:55.258
What about the apartment?

59:55.425 --> 59:57.093
Goddamn you!

59:57.261 --> 59:59.303
Why do you always
change things around?

59:59.471 --> 01:00:03.307
This is not about the apartment.
I hate this stupid place!

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:06.560
You know...

01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:09.355
you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.731
It's a little more than that.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:13.401
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:18.030
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:22.368
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.662
And God...

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.172
I am so lonely.

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:38.884
I miss you so much.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:41.470
I'm sorry, baby.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.640
I don't know what to do.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.061
Let's make a baby.

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:54.734
Don't tease me.

01:00:54.901 --> 01:00:56.736
I wouldn't do that.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.238
Not unless you asked.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.703
Oh, baby.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.561
Do you have this view?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.844
Kevin.

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:05.763
Make love to me.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:51.684
Kevin. What are you doing?

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.132
Stop. Stop.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:26.302
Oh, God.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.929
God. Where are you?

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.891
I'm right here.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.768
No, you're not.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.779
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.783
Because I need to know
and understand exactly...

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:51.785
what happened.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:55.372
You're standing there, you look down...

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.166
there's the gun.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.127
I don't know why I picked it up.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:03.214
It was before I saw Lucinda's body.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.175
You kneeled down to pick it up?

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:11.013
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.723
It's not something you plan for.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.267
Stop. Back up.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.854
Two prints by the gun.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.690
"Right hand.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.359
Right knee."

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.028
Right knee.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:27.947
We've been over this.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:29.782
I'm trying to picture it.

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.158
Your hand...

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.118
Your hand came from...

01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:37.331
inside and underneath?

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:43.212
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.683
There. Did you see it? Was it clear?

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.184
You got it?

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:58.769
Whose gun is that?

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:01.230
- It's mine.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.733
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun?

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.236
I have had nine death threats.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.905
Give it over. Give me the gun.

01:05:10.073 --> 01:05:11.532
I gotta protect myself.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.203
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.208
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:33.929
Okay.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.514
Let's wrap it up.

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.057
So, what's next?

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:40.644
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:41.895
Call her.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.982
You feel confident she'll back you
on the time?

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:48.527
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

01:05:48.737 --> 01:05:51.447
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:52.948
Okay.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.285
We're going to talk to her...

01:05:56.995 --> 01:06:00.122
and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

01:06:01.374 --> 01:06:03.042
All right?

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.588
No comment.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.717
There they are.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:15.846
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:18.932
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.478
Look over here. Are you really
going to plead Cullen not guilty?

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:23.979
What is happening?

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:27.399
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:31.862
Well, he always did like to stick his nose
in the camera.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.697
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.741
Mrs. Lomax, did you have a nice dinner?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.118
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.788
- Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

01:06:40.955 --> 01:06:42.456
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.124
Speak of the devil.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:49.421
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:50.923
Really?

01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:53.175
This is your mother?

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.968
Yes, Mom, this is...

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.720
- John Milton.
- John Milton.

01:06:57.764 --> 01:06:59.223
Alice Lomax.

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:01.767
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.478
How do you do?

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.730
Mary Ann.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.024
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.610
This is...

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.487
I believe you met Christabella.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:15.114
Yes, I think we did.

01:07:15.323 --> 01:07:16.782
And Gizelle.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:18.450
Fresh in from Paris.

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:19.660
Great.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.664
Nice to meet you.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:28.752
Three for you and my place.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.087
Thanks for the champagne.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.631
Oh, you're very welcome, Kevin.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.053
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:43.183
Yes.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:53.694
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

01:07:54.487 --> 01:07:57.364
And I'm sure it wasn't easy.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:00.743
No.

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.498
- Mom, we're here.
- Yes.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.417
- Good night to you.
- Good night.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.003
- Good night.
- Good night, Mary Ann.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.797
Kevin, hang on.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.884
Oh, how about Cullen? How's it going?

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.676
Everything on beam?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:21.095
That's a long conversation.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.265
Want to come up and tell me?

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:25.267
Now?

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.359
Let's talk tomorrow.

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:38.488
You sure?

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:39.782
Yeah.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.125
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:54.837
- What're you talking about?
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.881
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.258
I'm going to bed.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:09:00.719
- Good night, Alice.
- Night.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:15.943
Oh, shit.

01:09:18.947 --> 01:09:20.113
Mom.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:21.573
Mom, what are you doing?

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.075
I'm going home.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.035
What? What are you talking about?

01:09:25.203 --> 01:09:27.371
I don't feel right.

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.374
Look, you just got here.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:34.711
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.673
We'll talk later, okay?

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.050
Okay?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.638
I have to go, Kevin.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.265
I miss my church.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:50.769
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.856
You need to do a better job
with Mary Ann.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:56.024
She is not well.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.777
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.571
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:03.240
Help me out.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.367
I'll take her home if you let me.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:07.953
This is home. Understand?

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.454
This is where we live.

01:10:09.622 --> 01:10:11.748
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.834
Unbelievable.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.502
Wide is the gate...

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.797
and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.674
It's a little early for Scripture.

01:10:20.842 --> 01:10:23.051
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.994
Does my babysitter have to testify?

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:52.581
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:55.667
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:58.086
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:10:59.463
Tell you what, Melissa.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.966
Let's talk to her first. See where
she stands and take it from there.

01:11:03.134 --> 01:11:05.177
I'll make sure
Melissa gets down to the car.

01:11:05.345 --> 01:11:08.347
- Thanks, Pam.
- Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:11.725
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:14.394
That's why we're all working so hard.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.605
Thank you.

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:20.192
Can I have the car stop
at my ex-husband's?

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.903
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:29.618
George, remember,
no shredding in the building trash.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:31.578
- Only in the private refuse.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:34.831
Excelsior Securities,
who's handling that?

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.376
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.836
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:41.630
Mark. No, no, no.

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:45.509
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.263
I thought I was the only one working late.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.060
Well, so did we.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:58.355
Back to work. This is not a break.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:11:59.564
Good news.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.901
We just wrapped up with Cullen's assistant.
Looks like a great alibi.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:05.237
What a pleasant surprise.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.366
Looks like you've got your hands full.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:11.410
Oh, it's just a little...

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:13.495
housekeeping.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.123
If anyone should ask...

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.500
you never saw this.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.043
Who would ask?

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:23.839
- Weaver.
- Who's that?

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.634
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:32.222
- You don't know about Weaver?
- Sorry.

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.891
How nice for you.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:39.730
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.023
Title fight.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.150
Roy Jones Jr.

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.694
- I'd have to call Mary Ann.
- Do it on the way.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.698
Get my message?

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:52.200
I did. You write beautifully.

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.165
What's this Weaver Commission?

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:02.669
I don't like to micro-manage.
Find the talent, then delegate.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:05.630
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.842
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

01:13:09.761 --> 01:13:10.969
Excuse me.

01:13:11.179 --> 01:13:13.346
What the fuck are you looking at?

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.349
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

01:13:16.517 --> 01:13:18.060
I hear you fine.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.936
So get the fuck out of my car.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.232
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:25.984
Motherfucker, I'm telling you...

01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:28.278
- ...get the fuck out of my car...
- Shit.

01:13:28.488 --> 01:13:32.074
Get out before I cut your throat.
Fuck that.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:13:58.558
How do you know...?

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.775
Enjoy yourself. You still got time.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.278
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:12.405
You'll thank me in the morning.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.075
- You ain't right, man.
- Oh, I'm right.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:16.409
You'll see.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:19.079
Invigorating.

01:14:20.456 --> 01:14:22.124
What did you say to him?

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:27.212
I told him if he didn't leave us alone,
you'd kick his ass.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:30.507
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.261
Get some! You wanna lose?
You are on!

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:38.765
No, no, no.
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now.

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.318
Fixed!

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:59.286
- What a beauty.
- I'm glad you could come.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:03.039
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
here: Kevin Lomax.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.625
- Kevin Lomax. How are you?
- I'm well.

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.438
And say what?

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.690
He's the senior partner at the...

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.403
Mar, you're really starting to piss me off.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.789
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:48.460
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:50.712
That's exactly what I'm saying.

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:53.924
Go to bed. I have no idea.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.219
Ho! Ha!

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:07.812
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:11.816
The food, the heat, the rent
on that enormous apartment we live in.

01:16:13.027 --> 01:16:14.819
I live there too.

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:16.238
Mar.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:20.700
Give it back to me.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.162
I play the trumpet too.

01:16:24.956 --> 01:16:25.997
Kevin.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.209
Babs Coleman.

01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:30.835
Kevin Lomax.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.922
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:37.342
There's Tiffany.
New additions. Where are you from?

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:39.594
Don't tell me.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.097
Michigan.

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:45.058
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:46.685
How did he know?

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:49.020
That is so good.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:04.911
Cheers.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.097
Kevin?

01:17:33.357 --> 01:17:35.025
Honey?

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:58.840
Hello?

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.301
Who's there?

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.762
I got a knife.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:28.203
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:36.544
Baby...

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.005
how'd you get here?

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.467
Are you okay?

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:46.137
Oh, God.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.142
Where's your mommy?

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.730
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:58.233
What are you playing with?

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.444
What are you playing with?

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.988
Oh, God!

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:11.371
Oh, God! No! God!

01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:20.505
Baby, please.

01:19:20.798 --> 01:19:22.924
Baby, there is no blood.

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:25.760
There is no blood. It was a dream.

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.345
It was a dream.

01:19:28.681 --> 01:19:31.099
It's not a dream if it's true.

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:37.147
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

01:19:37.356 --> 01:19:38.440
No.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:40.442
I know you.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.279
You'll leave me now for sure.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:47.282
No! Get away from me.

01:19:47.491 --> 01:19:48.700
Okay.

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:52.954
Okay, I'm... I'm confused.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.456
Why?

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:56.791
What is it now?

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:00.753
Did you like the green?

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:02.922
You did, didn't you?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.591
We should go back to the green.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:07.385
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:09.471
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:12.640
What?

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.018
They took my ovaries!

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.312
I told you. Right here.

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.899
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:28.698
My sisters have seven children
between them.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.953
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:36.748
You could've set a clock by my periods.

01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:37.999
Baby...

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.877
what are you talking about?

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:44.964
Kevin, I can't have children.

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.424
What?

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.301
Says who?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.264
The doctor.

01:20:53.933 --> 01:20:56.017
I was there yesterday.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:00.271
Non-specific ovarian failure.

01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:03.858
That's ridiculous.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.196
Oh, God.

01:21:09.949 --> 01:21:11.658
Did you just hear that?

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:13.785
Listen.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.205
Can you hear that?

01:21:20.251 --> 01:21:21.292
No.

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:27.715
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:31.052
Mary Ann.

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:33.221
I know you.

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:35.390
God...

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.894
No, Kevin.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.813
It's these monsters.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:45.233
I dreamt about this.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:47.902
Baby, I gotta take this.

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.071
No, you've gotta listen to me.

01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:52.282
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Why do...?

01:21:52.491 --> 01:21:53.908
I gotta take this.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:57.495
It's going to be okay.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.667
Yeah.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:05.712
Fuck!

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.298
I knew the DA was holding out on us.

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.259
Get the discovery package
over here, right now.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.220
Mm-hm. I don't care. Find Cullen.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.399
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:29.902
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:32.864
You better have a good reason
for calling me out.

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:36.117
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

01:22:36.327 --> 01:22:39.495
She says, and I quote: "Alex is
fucking around and I can prove it."

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.539
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

01:22:41.749 --> 01:22:42.957
Wrong answer.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.460
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:48.212
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.590
You fuck around, she gets rich.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.217
That's a motive, Alex.

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:56.346
What do I need to know?

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.481
Melissa, my assistant.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:09.359
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:11.402
And...

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.738
on the night in question?

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.166
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:32.215
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

01:23:32.383 --> 01:23:35.760
No, forget it. We're not
telling that story.

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:39.597
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

01:23:41.975 --> 01:23:44.060
- Alessandra, wait.
- Alex...

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:46.437
- Alessandra.
- Alex.

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.356
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:50.233
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

01:23:50.984 --> 01:23:53.277
- Alex.
- I can't.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.948
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:59.951
You'll just have to wait until next week.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.996
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:07.125
For sleep.

01:24:07.334 --> 01:24:09.502
And she can take that during the day?

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:11.671
No, she won't be driving.

01:24:11.839 --> 01:24:14.674
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

01:24:14.967 --> 01:24:19.137
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:21.389
I'm taking you off the case.

01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:22.640
What?

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.517
I want you to drop this case.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.686
This case? Cullen?

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:29.731
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.858
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.276
She's sick.

01:24:33.485 --> 01:24:36.612
Everyone will understand.
I'll understand.

01:24:36.822 --> 01:24:38.281
What about Cullen?

01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:40.324
We find somebody new.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.160
You consult.

01:24:42.369 --> 01:24:44.162
You live to fight another day.

01:24:44.371 --> 01:24:47.832
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.001
It's a disappointment. We have them.

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:55.089
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.342
Hang on.

01:24:58.677 --> 01:25:00.178
We've gotta talk about this.

01:25:00.387 --> 01:25:03.639
Aw, listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.475
It's your wife, man.

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.685
She's sick, she needs you.

01:25:07.895 --> 01:25:09.854
She's got to come first.

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:11.689
All right, wait a minute.

01:25:11.899 --> 01:25:16.194
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:22.408
You know what scares me?

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:25.703
I quit the case, she gets better...

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.080
and I hate her for it.

01:25:29.416 --> 01:25:30.708
I don't want to resent her.

01:25:30.918 --> 01:25:32.251
I've got a winner here.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:36.547
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:37.882
Then...

01:25:38.383 --> 01:25:39.509
then...

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:41.928
put all my energy into her.

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:50.436
I stand corrected.

01:25:51.146 --> 01:25:53.981
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:58.027
She did to me, but she won't in court.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:25:59.737
Convince her otherwise.

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.740
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:07.078
when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

01:26:07.287 --> 01:26:08.663
you will know...

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:11.457
that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:13.751
of murdering three people...

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:15.503
in cold blood...

01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:18.172
and with malice aforethought.

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:19.882
Thank you.

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.385
Your Honor.

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:27.098
Mr. Lomax we can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:29.475
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:31.978
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.312
Proceed.

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:40.611
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:44.615
I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo talk.

01:26:44.825 --> 01:26:46.033
I know you're hungry.

01:26:46.243 --> 01:26:49.328
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:54.166
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

01:26:54.334 --> 01:26:57.044
I don't think he's a nice person.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.046
I don't expect you to like him.

01:27:00.007 --> 01:27:03.134
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:06.345
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.598
He's cheated the city, his partners...

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:09.849
his employees.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:13.686
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

01:27:13.896 --> 01:27:16.230
I don't like him.

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:20.693
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:23.696
that are going to make you
like him even less.

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:26.699
But this isn't a popularity contest.

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.409
It's a murder trial.

01:27:29.411 --> 01:27:34.498
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:38.502
is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:43.007
when these horrible crimes took place.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.676
Now, the State...

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:48.596
The State is going all out here.

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.473
They've got this whole team here...

01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:53.267
throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.186
I want one thing from you.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:56.771
That's it.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:58.356
One thing.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:02.026
I want you to ask yourself:

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.738
"Is not liking this man..."

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.617
reason enough...

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.911
"...to convict him of murder?"

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:16.374
Enjoy your lunch.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.125
We'll talk again.

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:23.464
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.884
Listen to me like you've never
listened to anyone before in your life.

01:28:27.094 --> 01:28:29.470
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.891
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife.

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.229
Why didn't you say something before?

01:28:38.981 --> 01:28:41.148
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:45.027
Oh, you got it now?

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.708
- Hey. Kevin.
- Eddie.

01:28:58.917 --> 01:29:00.167
Saw you go in.

01:29:00.377 --> 01:29:01.419
What's up?

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.295
Congratulations.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:07.216
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

01:29:07.426 --> 01:29:08.759
What are you talking about?

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:12.263
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:14.432
What?

01:29:14.641 --> 01:29:16.475
It looks like it's been there for years.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:19.395
So now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

01:29:19.604 --> 01:29:23.566
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:25.443
You want my job, take me head on.

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.153
You backdoor me one more time...

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:30.698
and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:34.035
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone.

01:29:34.244 --> 01:29:36.871
- Bullshit.
- You got a problem with documents...

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.082
put together one of your
late-night shredding sessions.

01:29:45.213 --> 01:29:47.840
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:51.677
Ha! Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:53.512
Tell your mentor...

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:56.849
the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

01:29:57.059 --> 01:29:58.309
pick up the phone.

01:30:03.356 --> 01:30:05.524
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.276
He was going running.

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.904
What the hell was he talking about?

01:30:11.073 --> 01:30:13.491
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

01:30:14.326 --> 01:30:17.995
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.500
Why does he think I'm after his job?

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:25.377
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.797
- Not directly, no.
- You do now.

01:30:28.006 --> 01:30:30.716
- 346.
- It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:33.803
He may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.180
- It's an emergency.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:38.474
You look like you could use a drink.

01:30:38.642 --> 01:30:40.518
Yes. Yes, thanks.

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:45.022
Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon. Ha.

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:49.151
I nursed him through two divorces,
a cocaine rehab...

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.737
and a pregnant receptionist.

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.865
Ha. God's creature, right?

01:30:55.033 --> 01:30:57.284
God's special creature?

01:30:58.745 --> 01:31:00.412
I've warned him, Kevin.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.748
I've warned him every step of the way.

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:05.459
Watching him bounce around
like a fucking game.

01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:07.044
Like a wind-up toy.

01:31:07.254 --> 01:31:08.879
Like 250 pounds...

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.924
of self-serving greed on wheels.

01:31:12.092 --> 01:31:15.177
The next thousand years
is right around the corner, Kevin.

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:16.595
Eddie Barzoon.

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:18.389
- Take a good look because...
- Excuse me.

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:22.434
He's the poster child
for the next millennium.

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:26.981
These people, it's no mystery
where they come from.

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:32.736
You sharpen the human appetite...

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:36.657
to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.535
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:43.664
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:47.918
Grease even the dullest dreams
with these dollar-green...

01:31:48.086 --> 01:31:52.131
gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

01:31:52.299 --> 01:31:55.092
becomes his own god.
Where can you go from there?

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.096
- Hey. Wrong way.
- Yeah, yeah. Fuck you...

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:00.681
As we're scrambling...

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:04.185
from one deal to the next,
who's got his eye on the planet?

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:06.353
As the air thickens, the water sours...

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.857
even bees' honey takes on
the metallic taste of radioactivity...

01:32:10.066 --> 01:32:12.818
and it just keeps coming,
faster and faster.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.821
Oh, fuck! Help! Stop it!

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.532
There's no chance to think, to prepare.

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.368
It's buy futures, sell futures...

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.454
when there is no future.

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:25.497
We got a runaway train, boy.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:29.710
We got a billion Eddie Barzoons
all jogging into the future.

01:32:29.878 --> 01:32:33.631
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.341
lick their fingers clean...

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:39.094
as they reach out toward their pristine,
cybernetic keyboards...

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.639
to tote up their fucking billable hours.

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:43.474
And then it hits home.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:46.810
You gotta pay your own way, Eddie.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.813
A little late in the game to buy out now.

01:32:49.981 --> 01:32:51.315
Give me your watch.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:54.610
What? I like this watch.
Do you think you're just going to take it?

01:32:56.321 --> 01:32:59.657
Your belly's too full, your dick is sore...

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:03.244
your eyes are bloodshot and
you're screaming for someone to help.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:07.456
But guess what? There's no one there.

01:33:09.042 --> 01:33:13.879
You're all alone, Eddie.
You're God's special little creature.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.714
No.

01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:23.847
Maybe it's true.
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.850
Maybe he let us all down.

01:33:36.403 --> 01:33:39.196
You testified
the defendant called you at 4:30...

01:33:39.406 --> 01:33:42.866
to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:44.118
Yes.

01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:48.163
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:49.581
He's the boss.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:52.668
Yes.

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.879
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.048
Yes, I went up at 6: 10.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.010
I knew it was 6:10 because I heard
the weather coming on the news...

01:34:01.219 --> 01:34:02.303
Okay, stop.

01:34:03.513 --> 01:34:05.723
This prosecutor is no fool.

01:34:06.224 --> 01:34:10.060
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:14.106
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:15.899
So, what do we do?

01:34:18.236 --> 01:34:19.903
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.614
Exactly.

01:34:24.909 --> 01:34:29.747
Is it your testimony, Ms. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:32.958
you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

01:34:33.168 --> 01:34:34.293
Yes.

01:34:34.461 --> 01:34:36.337
At any point during this three-hour
marathon...

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.505
did you lose sight of the defendant?

01:34:38.715 --> 01:34:41.091
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

01:34:41.259 --> 01:34:43.218
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:52.436
- You understand the question?
- Yeah.

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.689
So is he cut or not?

01:34:55.857 --> 01:34:57.066
Yes.

01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.860
Which is it?

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:03.906
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

01:35:04.074 --> 01:35:07.534
- You don't know if he has foreskin?
- I've had enough of your fucking game!

01:35:07.702 --> 01:35:11.121
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass?

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:29.181
Kevin.

01:35:29.349 --> 01:35:30.682
What's happening?

01:35:30.892 --> 01:35:34.228
- It's Eddie Barzoon.
- What about him?

01:35:34.396 --> 01:35:36.522
He's dead. He was killed.

01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:38.941
- When?
- Last night. In the park.

01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:40.692
He was running, if you can believe it.

01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:42.569
What is wrong with people?

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.863
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:46.115
Who?

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.700
Two old homeless crazies.

01:35:50.745 --> 01:35:53.831
Kevin. I'm sorry,
you're due in court in 30 minutes.

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:56.667
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished here or what?

01:35:56.876 --> 01:36:00.170
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:07.636
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

01:36:08.346 --> 01:36:10.514
You've got to deal with Cullen.

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:14.726
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:17.729
I can't put her on the stand.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:21.066
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying.

01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:26.572
She's lying because she didn't answer
you fast enough? She lied to you? No.

01:36:26.739 --> 01:36:28.866
She said nothing.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:31.243
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:33.495
He killed those people.

01:36:34.914 --> 01:36:36.790
You really believe that?

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:39.418
He set me up.

01:36:39.586 --> 01:36:42.713
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa, the whole thing.

01:36:42.881 --> 01:36:44.465
I know it.

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:48.427
Gotta go with your gut.

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:50.304
That's your advice?

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:53.891
I'll back you either way.

01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:58.061
Maybe it's your time to lose.

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:01.982
Think I haven't lost before?

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:09.448
Kevin.

01:37:10.408 --> 01:37:12.743
We talked about this, remember?

01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:14.453
Pressure.

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:18.040
Take a big whiff.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:21.293
All rise.

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:24.755
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:32.638
Please be seated.

01:37:37.227 --> 01:37:41.021
All right, Mr. Lomax,
you may present your case.

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:01.792
Mr. Lomax.

01:38:24.023 --> 01:38:25.691
I call Melissa Black.

01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:44.918
Raise your right hand.

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:47.963
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth...

01:38:48.131 --> 01:38:50.632
- So help you God?
- I do.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:13.905
Kevin!

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:16.783
I have maintained my innocence
all along, now you see proof.

01:39:16.993 --> 01:39:18.827
Feeney, it's him.

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:24.750
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:27.544
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

01:39:54.447 --> 01:39:56.073
Honey.

01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:58.492
Mar, it's me.

01:39:59.202 --> 01:40:00.577
What happened?

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:02.371
Are you okay?

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:05.499
He let himself in. You need to know that.

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:08.210
Who let himself in?

01:40:08.461 --> 01:40:12.130
The bath was running or something.

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:14.675
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.843
And then we talked.

01:40:17.387 --> 01:40:20.055
And we talked for hours.

01:40:20.223 --> 01:40:22.391
And I haven't talked to anyone...

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:24.976
really talked to anyone in so long.

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:28.105
Did somebody hurt you?

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:29.940
Yeah.

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:32.275
Who?

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:35.696
Milton.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.280
What?

01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:39.783
He...

01:40:43.454 --> 01:40:44.788
He...

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:46.915
He fucked me.

01:40:49.293 --> 01:40:52.754
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just...

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:55.465
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:59.636
He just wouldn't stop.

01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:03.223
When?

01:41:03.808 --> 01:41:06.268
- Baby, when?
- Today.

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:11.898
The whole afternoon.

01:41:13.776 --> 01:41:15.318
I'm so ashamed.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:17.529
Today?

01:41:17.697 --> 01:41:18.947
Yeah.

01:41:19.699 --> 01:41:20.866
Today?

01:41:22.118 --> 01:41:23.952
Today he was in court.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.955
He was in court
in my presence all afternoon!

01:41:27.123 --> 01:41:28.498
- No!
- Yes!

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:30.792
Yes! Yes!

01:41:31.419 --> 01:41:32.627
No.

01:41:33.296 --> 01:41:35.005
God, no, Kevin.

01:41:35.173 --> 01:41:37.340
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

01:41:37.508 --> 01:41:39.426
You have to believe me.

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.016
- No!
- Oh, Jesus.

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:48.143
He did this to me!

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.146
No!

01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.231
He did this to me.

01:41:53.441 --> 01:41:57.444
What did you do to yourself?
What are we going to do, baby?

01:41:58.237 --> 01:42:00.655
What am I going to do?

01:42:02.450 --> 01:42:05.744
Sign there. And your relationship.

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:10.499
She's calm now. This might be
a good time to say good night to her.

01:42:19.217 --> 01:42:21.510
I know why this is happening.

01:42:24.847 --> 01:42:26.556
They want you to sleep.

01:42:28.351 --> 01:42:29.768
It's the money.

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:31.937
Blood money.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:36.024
We just drank it down, both of us.

01:42:36.859 --> 01:42:38.360
We knew it.

01:42:39.946 --> 01:42:45.033
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

01:42:45.201 --> 01:42:47.911
But you just kept on winning...

01:42:48.079 --> 01:42:50.247
every time.

01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:58.630
I can't look at myself in the mirror.

01:42:59.215 --> 01:43:01.424
I see a monster.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:08.849
Don't do this, Kevin.
Please take me home.

01:43:09.058 --> 01:43:11.560
Please don't do this.

01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:14.020
I'm not crazy.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:31.955
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:44.175
- Alessandra, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:47.220
Mrs. Skylar.

01:43:53.311 --> 01:43:54.936
We are here today...

01:43:55.479 --> 01:43:57.147
to remember Eddie Barzoon.

01:43:57.356 --> 01:43:58.690
Isn't she lovely?

01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:03.111
We have gathered here
to seek shelter in our common grief.

01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:05.780
To draw strength toward our tested faith.

01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:09.284
So, what do they say? How's Mary Ann?

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:11.244
They don't know.

01:44:11.412 --> 01:44:12.913
She's...

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.040
She's falling apart.

01:44:15.207 --> 01:44:16.625
Hallucinations.

01:44:16.834 --> 01:44:18.460
Milton...

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:20.962
It's bad.

01:44:24.342 --> 01:44:25.842
Do you have room for one more?

01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:28.470
Beloved father. Devoted husband.

01:44:29.096 --> 01:44:30.513
Trusted friend.

01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:33.350
Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.

01:44:33.517 --> 01:44:35.393
All of these things.

01:44:35.686 --> 01:44:38.521
And yet one thing more:

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:41.274
Child of God.

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:45.278
And it is to that Father
that he now returns.

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:46.947
Eddie Barzoon...

01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:50.575
such a vibrant member
of our community...

01:44:50.743 --> 01:44:53.536
has moved beyond us now.

01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:55.872
He has entered...

01:44:56.040 --> 01:44:58.041
a new communion.

01:44:58.209 --> 01:45:01.461
And for that it is a time of rejoicing.

01:45:02.213 --> 01:45:04.631
God, who is our refuge and our strength.

01:45:06.217 --> 01:45:09.636
God, who is that very present help...

01:45:09.804 --> 01:45:12.097
in time of trouble.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:15.225
Therefore we will not fear...

01:45:15.393 --> 01:45:17.227
though the Earth should change...

01:45:17.436 --> 01:45:20.230
though the mountains shake
in the heart of the sea...

01:45:20.439 --> 01:45:23.024
though its waters roar and foam...

01:45:23.192 --> 01:45:26.194
though the mountains tremble
with its tumult.

01:45:26.362 --> 01:45:28.571
We cannot fear too long...

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:30.240
for Eddie Barzoon...

01:45:30.449 --> 01:45:32.075
has gone home.

01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:52.262
Mr. Lomax?

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:54.681
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:56.349
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

01:45:56.559 --> 01:45:58.893
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

01:45:59.103 --> 01:46:00.895
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

01:46:01.105 --> 01:46:02.230
Staking out the funeral?

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:04.190
Looking for you, actually.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:06.901
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:11.281
Just wanted to ask you, off the record.
I have a few questions about Eddie.

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:31.384
Milton, Chadwick, Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:32.677
But I assumed you knew that.

01:46:34.055 --> 01:46:36.264
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:40.060
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
Arms brokering, mostly.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:44.022
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
Chemical weapons and toxic waste.

01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:47.108
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
Money laundering for the eastern bloc.

01:46:47.318 --> 01:46:51.446
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:05.835
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:08.129
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:11.299
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

01:47:11.509 --> 01:47:13.843
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

01:47:14.053 --> 01:47:17.347
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

01:47:18.349 --> 01:47:20.475
Now stay off my back!

01:47:23.771 --> 01:47:26.106
This is a first-time last-time offer,
Kevin.

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:28.399
I'm learning about you.

01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:31.444
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:32.862
The Gettys case?

01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:35.490
Eighth grade teacher?

01:47:36.784 --> 01:47:39.410
They found him yesterday.

01:47:40.287 --> 01:47:44.082
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car.

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:05.395
Is he all right? Get help!

01:48:28.544 --> 01:48:30.962
Hey, Marie,
do you want to go to the party?

01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:32.297
- Come on.
- No.

01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:33.840
Horace will be disappointed.

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:36.301
It's a birthday party. We can sing.

01:48:36.468 --> 01:48:38.511
"Or indeed, His divine power..."

01:48:38.679 --> 01:48:42.390
has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety...

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.394
"...through the knowledge of Him
who has called us..."

01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:48.730
Kevin?

01:48:49.523 --> 01:48:50.982
What are you doing here?

01:48:52.193 --> 01:48:54.652
I came this morning.

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:58.698
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:00.366
I need to talk to you.

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:02.785
We got her on the first flight up
this morning.

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:13.546
Are you all right, Kevin?

01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:17.342
I just...

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:21.679
I don't know.

01:49:24.934 --> 01:49:27.352
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

01:49:27.561 --> 01:49:29.020
- Sure.
- Come on, Kevin.

01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:32.315
How you doing, sweetie?

01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:35.902
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:37.403
There.

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:43.368
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.913
I'll never forgive myself.

01:49:47.957 --> 01:49:51.709
- There's nothing you could've done.
- Oh, I could've told you the truth.

01:49:52.836 --> 01:49:54.587
About what?

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:58.591
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

01:49:58.759 --> 01:50:01.344
I was here in New York.

01:50:01.512 --> 01:50:04.847
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

01:50:06.892 --> 01:50:10.561
- What are you talking about?
- I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:14.732
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:16.192
Wait. Stop.

01:50:16.402 --> 01:50:19.070
Your father was a waiter
in that restaurant.

01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:22.615
My father?

01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.454
Oh, this is great, Ma.

01:50:30.499 --> 01:50:33.042
- Honey, please listen.
- Now?

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:34.794
You do this now?

01:50:34.962 --> 01:50:37.088
Because, I mean, your timing, it's superb.

01:50:37.256 --> 01:50:40.341
You wait 30 years,
you fly up here, you pick today?

01:50:40.509 --> 01:50:41.592
Kevin, honey, just...

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.595
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

01:50:44.763 --> 01:50:46.014
I need this...

01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.351
Listen to me!

01:50:50.519 --> 01:50:52.895
Kevin. Kevin.

01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:54.897
Kevin.

01:50:55.190 --> 01:51:00.278
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:07.785
Oh. Don't you look beautiful now.

01:51:11.915 --> 01:51:13.416
Take a look and see.

01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:16.377
It's all right, dear. Look.

01:51:16.587 --> 01:51:19.464
- No.
- Go on, take a look.

01:51:19.798 --> 01:51:22.133
See how beautiful you are?

01:51:29.099 --> 01:51:30.767
See?

01:51:35.064 --> 01:51:36.689
Get out!

01:51:38.192 --> 01:51:39.484
What happened?

01:51:39.651 --> 01:51:41.903
She attacked me.

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:45.031
Mary Ann. Mary Ann.

01:51:45.532 --> 01:51:47.450
Open the door.

01:51:47.618 --> 01:51:49.035
Open the door, Mar.

01:51:51.330 --> 01:51:54.165
Mar? Open the door. Mar.

01:51:54.375 --> 01:51:57.502
Mar? Come on, Mar.

01:51:57.669 --> 01:52:00.338
It's okay. Open the door!

01:52:00.547 --> 01:52:02.173
- No!
- Mar!

01:52:02.341 --> 01:52:03.925
Come on!

01:52:04.093 --> 01:52:06.260
Open the door!

01:52:07.221 --> 01:52:08.429
Mar!

01:52:08.639 --> 01:52:10.556
Open the door, Mar!

01:52:10.724 --> 01:52:14.769
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!

01:52:14.937 --> 01:52:16.354
Somebody! Help!

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:19.065
No! Mar!

01:52:19.274 --> 01:52:20.650
Pam, get help!

01:52:20.818 --> 01:52:22.402
Go!

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:31.077
Mar! Sweetheart!

01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:37.041
- Mar, look at me!
- I love you.

01:52:40.295 --> 01:52:42.296
No, no, no!

01:52:44.508 --> 01:52:46.008
No!

01:52:46.427 --> 01:52:50.096
Oh, God, Mar, what have you done?
What have you done?

01:52:51.432 --> 01:52:53.891
We need a doctor in here!

01:52:54.059 --> 01:52:56.352
We need a doctor!

01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:01.065
Mar, Mar, Mar, please stay with me, Mar!

01:53:02.443 --> 01:53:03.860
Stay with me, Mar!

01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:06.112
Get Dr. Job in here now!

01:53:06.447 --> 01:53:09.407
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

01:53:09.908 --> 01:53:11.617
Sir, off! Go!

01:53:12.244 --> 01:53:14.620
Come on. Come on.

01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:18.082
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:21.085
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

01:53:36.810 --> 01:53:38.519
Finish the story.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:41.355
1966. You were in New York.

01:53:41.565 --> 01:53:43.649
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

01:53:43.859 --> 01:53:46.027
Finish the story.

01:53:48.822 --> 01:53:50.490
He talked to me.

01:53:51.325 --> 01:53:54.118
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

01:53:54.328 --> 01:53:58.998
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

01:53:59.333 --> 01:54:02.668
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

01:54:05.172 --> 01:54:08.257
Every meal, there he was
at my ear and I was...

01:54:09.426 --> 01:54:13.012
That last night he came
to say goodbye...

01:54:15.265 --> 01:54:16.807
and I started crying.

01:54:17.017 --> 01:54:19.018
And he told me:

01:54:20.521 --> 01:54:24.190
Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves.

01:54:24.691 --> 01:54:26.609
I want to hear you say it.

01:54:29.363 --> 01:54:32.114
- His face that night, I knew it was him.
- Say it.

01:54:32.324 --> 01:54:36.911
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.

01:54:37.079 --> 01:54:39.705
- Say it!
- I didn't have the heart to tell you.

01:54:39.873 --> 01:54:42.041
- You wondered yourself. The money...
- Say it!

01:54:42.251 --> 01:54:45.253
That apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere.

01:54:45.462 --> 01:54:47.213
Say it!

01:54:47.381 --> 01:54:49.215
Milton, he's your...

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:50.925
father.

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:53.302
He's your father.

01:54:54.805 --> 01:54:57.890
Somehow he found us.
He tracked you down.

01:54:58.058 --> 01:54:59.308
- No.
- He did.

01:54:59.935 --> 01:55:01.727
He's always been there.

01:55:03.063 --> 01:55:04.814
I know that now.

01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:07.316
Watching.

01:55:08.193 --> 01:55:09.235
Waiting.

01:55:11.029 --> 01:55:13.072
Playing us like a game.

01:55:13.282 --> 01:55:14.448
What do you mean?

01:55:14.616 --> 01:55:15.992
I gotta go.

01:55:17.327 --> 01:55:19.829
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.

01:55:19.997 --> 01:55:22.456
Forget about him. We can leave here.

01:55:22.624 --> 01:55:25.251
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

01:55:25.419 --> 01:55:27.336
I can't do it.

01:55:27.588 --> 01:55:29.839
You go home. You go home.

01:55:30.007 --> 01:55:31.299
- Kevin.
- I have to go.

01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:34.135
- I have to go.
- Wait.

01:55:34.595 --> 01:55:36.512
I love you.

01:55:45.647 --> 01:55:47.940
- There you are.
- Pam.

01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:50.610
Look at you. You're terrified.

01:55:50.861 --> 01:55:52.236
Not to worry.

01:55:52.446 --> 01:55:54.113
He'll take away that fear.

01:55:54.323 --> 01:55:56.907
You don't ever have to be
frightened again.

01:55:57.159 --> 01:55:58.242
Go on.

01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:00.036
He's waiting for you.

01:56:00.746 --> 01:56:01.787
Go.

01:57:14.319 --> 01:57:16.570
You were right about one thing.

01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:20.449
I have been watching.
Couldn't help myself.

01:57:20.659 --> 01:57:21.826
Watching.

01:57:22.202 --> 01:57:23.661
Waiting.

01:57:24.121 --> 01:57:26.122
Holding my breath.

01:57:26.665 --> 01:57:29.417
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

01:57:30.377 --> 01:57:32.336
I don't make things happen.

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.046
Doesn't work like that.

01:57:34.256 --> 01:57:36.298
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

01:57:36.466 --> 01:57:40.094
Free will. It's like butterfly wings.

01:57:40.262 --> 01:57:43.097
Once touched,
they never get off the ground.

01:57:43.265 --> 01:57:44.432
No.

01:57:44.599 --> 01:57:47.351
I only set the stage.

01:57:47.519 --> 01:57:48.728
You pull your own strings.

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:51.397
What did you do to Mary Ann?

01:57:51.565 --> 01:57:54.066
A gun? In here?

01:57:54.234 --> 01:57:56.902
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

01:57:58.280 --> 01:57:59.780
Well...

01:58:01.241 --> 01:58:03.743
on a scale of one to 10...

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:07.997
10 being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man...

01:58:08.165 --> 01:58:12.209
one being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxs'...

01:58:12.377 --> 01:58:14.253
I'd say, not to be immodest...

01:58:14.421 --> 01:58:18.340
Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

01:58:18.508 --> 01:58:19.759
Fuck you!

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:22.762
Oh. Oh. Oh. Got me!

01:58:22.971 --> 01:58:26.682
Got me! Yes!

01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:29.018
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

01:58:29.186 --> 01:58:32.062
Step it up, son! Come on! That's good!

01:58:32.230 --> 01:58:34.398
You got to hold on to that fury.

01:58:34.608 --> 01:58:36.317
That's the last thing to go.

01:58:36.485 --> 01:58:40.738
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

01:58:41.615 --> 01:58:44.408
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

01:58:44.576 --> 01:58:46.076
Who are you?

01:58:47.078 --> 01:58:49.288
Never lost a case.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:51.707
Why?

01:58:51.875 --> 01:58:54.043
Why do you think?

01:58:54.669 --> 01:58:56.921
Because you're so fucking good.

01:58:57.088 --> 01:58:58.631
Yeah?

01:58:59.090 --> 01:59:00.800
But why?

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:04.178
Because you're my father?

01:59:04.346 --> 01:59:07.056
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:10.351
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

01:59:10.519 --> 01:59:13.270
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:15.523
"It was a nice run, Kev."

01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:17.525
"Had to close out some day."

01:59:17.734 --> 01:59:19.318
"Nobody wins them all."

01:59:21.571 --> 01:59:23.239
What are you?

01:59:24.699 --> 01:59:26.158
Oh.

01:59:26.326 --> 01:59:28.452
I have so many names.

01:59:30.163 --> 01:59:31.205
Satan.

01:59:34.084 --> 01:59:36.085
Call me Dad.

01:59:38.630 --> 01:59:40.923
Mary Ann, she knew it.

01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:44.468
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

01:59:44.636 --> 01:59:47.429
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

01:59:47.597 --> 01:59:49.682
Oh, I hope you're kidding.

01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:52.601
Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

01:59:52.769 --> 01:59:54.228
All she wanted was love.

01:59:54.396 --> 01:59:56.438
Hey, you were too busy.

01:59:56.606 --> 01:59:57.648
That's a lie.

01:59:57.816 --> 01:59:59.233
Mary Ann in New York?

01:59:59.401 --> 02:00:03.654
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

02:00:03.822 --> 02:00:05.531
That's not true.
You don't know what we had.

02:00:05.699 --> 02:00:08.158
- You don't know anything about it.
- Hey, I'm on your side.

02:00:08.326 --> 02:00:11.453
- You're a liar!
- No, hey... Kevin.

02:00:11.663 --> 02:00:13.998
There's nothing out there for you.

02:00:14.165 --> 02:00:17.251
Don't be such a fucking chump.

02:00:17.419 --> 02:00:20.045
Stop deluding yourself.

02:00:21.131 --> 02:00:23.549
I told you to take care of your wife.

02:00:23.717 --> 02:00:24.842
What did I say?

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:28.596
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

02:00:28.763 --> 02:00:30.431
What did you do?

02:00:31.016 --> 02:00:32.975
"You know what scares me, John?

02:00:33.184 --> 02:00:37.688
I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

02:00:38.398 --> 02:00:39.899
Remember?

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:43.444
I know what you did.
You set me up.

02:00:43.612 --> 02:00:45.905
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Gettys?

02:00:46.072 --> 02:00:49.325
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

02:00:49.492 --> 02:00:51.994
And Moyez. The direction you took.

02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:56.498
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

02:00:56.666 --> 02:00:58.959
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

02:00:59.169 --> 02:01:00.753
It was a test! Your test!

02:01:00.921 --> 02:01:04.465
And Cullen. Knowing he was guilty.

02:01:04.633 --> 02:01:06.383
Seeing those pictures.

02:01:06.593 --> 02:01:10.429
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand.

02:01:10.597 --> 02:01:13.849
You brought me in. You put me there.
You made her lie.

02:01:14.017 --> 02:01:15.684
I don't do that, Kevin!

02:01:15.852 --> 02:01:18.729
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

02:01:18.897 --> 02:01:21.690
What were my words to you?

02:01:22.067 --> 02:01:25.778
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

02:01:25.946 --> 02:01:28.280
Lose? I don't lose!

02:01:28.448 --> 02:01:31.241
I win!

02:01:31.409 --> 02:01:34.286
I'm a lawyer! That's my job.
That's what I do.

02:01:36.748 --> 02:01:38.791
I rest my case.

02:01:43.213 --> 02:01:44.755
Vanity...

02:01:45.256 --> 02:01:47.967
is definitely my favorite sin.

02:01:49.344 --> 02:01:52.012
Kevin, it's so basic.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:53.764
Self-love.

02:01:53.932 --> 02:01:56.225
The all-natural opiate.

02:01:57.268 --> 02:02:00.771
You know, it's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:05.693
it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

02:02:07.362 --> 02:02:09.071
Yourself.

02:02:11.950 --> 02:02:13.409
You're right.

02:02:13.576 --> 02:02:15.160
I did it all.

02:02:15.328 --> 02:02:16.704
I let her go.

02:02:16.871 --> 02:02:21.125
Aw, don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

02:02:21.292 --> 02:02:22.584
Believe me.

02:02:22.752 --> 02:02:23.836
I...

02:02:24.004 --> 02:02:26.255
I left her behind and just kept going.

02:02:26.423 --> 02:02:28.924
You cannot keep punishing yourself,
Kevin.

02:02:29.092 --> 02:02:32.344
It's awesome how far you've come.

02:02:32.512 --> 02:02:34.513
I didn't make it easy.

02:02:34.681 --> 02:02:35.973
Couldn't.

02:02:36.808 --> 02:02:38.684
Not for you...

02:02:41.271 --> 02:02:43.397
or your sister.

02:02:47.027 --> 02:02:49.278
Half-sister, to be exact.

02:02:50.071 --> 02:02:52.031
Surprise.

02:02:52.449 --> 02:02:55.492
Some scene, Kevin?

02:02:57.787 --> 02:02:59.496
Don't let him scare you, eh?

02:02:59.706 --> 02:03:02.875
Kevin, I've had so many children.

02:03:03.043 --> 02:03:06.211
I've had so many disappointments.

02:03:06.379 --> 02:03:08.672
Mistake after mistake.

02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.382
And then there's you.

02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:11.925
The two of you.

02:03:15.096 --> 02:03:16.555
What do you want from me?

02:03:16.723 --> 02:03:18.640
I want you to be yourself.

02:03:18.808 --> 02:03:20.434
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

02:03:20.602 --> 02:03:21.643
guilt...

02:03:21.853 --> 02:03:24.313
it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

02:03:24.481 --> 02:03:26.065
All you gotta do...

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:28.442
is set it down.

02:03:29.611 --> 02:03:30.944
Hey.

02:03:31.112 --> 02:03:33.405
I know what you're going through.

02:03:33.573 --> 02:03:34.823
I've been there.

02:03:34.991 --> 02:03:36.909
Just come here. Come here.

02:03:37.077 --> 02:03:38.911
Yeah. Let it go.

02:03:40.121 --> 02:03:42.664
I can't do that.

02:03:45.376 --> 02:03:48.712
Who are you carrying
all those bricks for anyway?

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:50.547
God?

02:03:50.715 --> 02:03:52.174
Is that it?

02:03:52.342 --> 02:03:53.425
God?

02:03:53.593 --> 02:03:54.802
I'll tell you...

02:03:54.969 --> 02:03:58.931
let me give you
a little inside information about God.

02:03:59.099 --> 02:04:01.100
God likes to watch.

02:04:01.267 --> 02:04:02.434
He's a prankster.

02:04:02.602 --> 02:04:04.269
Think about it.

02:04:04.437 --> 02:04:05.854
He gives man...

02:04:06.022 --> 02:04:07.856
instincts.

02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:11.985
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does he do?

02:04:12.153 --> 02:04:14.947
I swear, for his own amusement...

02:04:15.115 --> 02:04:20.285
his own private, cosmic gag reel...

02:04:20.453 --> 02:04:22.538
he sets the rules in opposition.

02:04:22.747 --> 02:04:24.164
It's the goof of all time.

02:04:24.374 --> 02:04:27.084
Look, but don't touch.

02:04:28.336 --> 02:04:31.588
Touch, but don't taste.

02:04:32.507 --> 02:04:34.508
Taste, but don't swallow.

02:04:36.094 --> 02:04:40.097
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is he doing?

02:04:40.265 --> 02:04:43.892
He's laughing his sick fucking ass off!

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.561
He's a tightass!

02:04:45.728 --> 02:04:48.147
He's a sadist!

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:51.150
He's an absentee landlord!

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:54.069
Worship that? Never!

02:04:54.237 --> 02:04:57.364
Better to reign in hell
than serve in heaven, is that it?

02:04:57.574 --> 02:04:59.032
Why not?

02:04:59.200 --> 02:05:03.704
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began.

02:05:04.539 --> 02:05:09.293
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have.

02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:13.088
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him.

02:05:13.256 --> 02:05:17.885
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections.

02:05:18.052 --> 02:05:19.720
I'm a fan of man!

02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:23.724
I'm a humanist.

02:05:23.892 --> 02:05:25.642
Maybe the last humanist.

02:05:26.519 --> 02:05:28.604
Who, in their right mind...

02:05:28.771 --> 02:05:30.939
Kevin, could possibly deny...

02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:34.109
the 20th century was entirely mine?

02:05:34.277 --> 02:05:36.820
All of it, Kevin!

02:05:36.988 --> 02:05:38.947
All of it!

02:05:39.449 --> 02:05:41.241
Mine.

02:05:41.451 --> 02:05:43.619
I'm peaking, Kevin.

02:05:44.412 --> 02:05:46.622
It's my time now.

02:05:47.707 --> 02:05:49.249
It's our time.

02:05:49.417 --> 02:05:51.627
Anybody want a drink?

02:05:53.004 --> 02:05:55.088
I'm having a drink.

02:05:57.842 --> 02:06:00.594
This is some pitch, all this.

02:06:01.221 --> 02:06:03.222
You must need me pretty bad.

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.932
What do you want?

02:06:05.892 --> 02:06:07.851
Eddie was right.

02:06:08.519 --> 02:06:11.188
I want you to take over the firm.

02:06:11.356 --> 02:06:13.065
You...

02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:15.817
and your sister.

02:06:19.364 --> 02:06:22.199
- Is that it?
- No.

02:06:23.868 --> 02:06:25.535
She's ovulating...

02:06:25.703 --> 02:06:28.205
- Right now.
- What?

02:06:28.373 --> 02:06:30.040
Your vanity...

02:06:30.208 --> 02:06:32.668
is justified, Kevin.

02:06:33.962 --> 02:06:35.254
Your seed...

02:06:35.421 --> 02:06:37.881
is the key to a new future.

02:06:38.049 --> 02:06:42.010
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

02:06:42.178 --> 02:06:44.888
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

02:06:46.224 --> 02:06:48.183
You want a child.

02:06:48.351 --> 02:06:50.018
I want a family.

02:06:51.062 --> 02:06:53.230
The Antichrist.

02:06:57.443 --> 02:06:58.652
Whatever.

02:07:03.116 --> 02:07:05.784
But I have to volunteer.

02:07:07.078 --> 02:07:10.539
Free will, it is a bitch.

02:07:11.916 --> 02:07:14.543
Kevin, I need a family.

02:07:14.711 --> 02:07:16.712
I need help. I'm busy.

02:07:16.879 --> 02:07:18.755
Millennium's coming, son.

02:07:18.923 --> 02:07:22.592
Title fight. Round 20. Ha, ha.

02:07:23.678 --> 02:07:26.054
I'm ready to work.

02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:29.057
What do you say, kid?

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.393
What're you offering?

02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:35.063
Are we negotiating?

02:07:35.231 --> 02:07:37.065
Always.

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:40.694
Yes.

02:07:41.446 --> 02:07:43.488
What are you offering?

02:07:43.823 --> 02:07:45.073
Everything.

02:07:45.283 --> 02:07:46.450
Anything.

02:07:46.659 --> 02:07:48.952
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

02:07:49.162 --> 02:07:53.040
Instant bliss. Bliss on tap. Ha, ha.

02:07:53.207 --> 02:07:56.001
Bliss any way you want it.

02:07:58.129 --> 02:08:00.839
How about that first line of cocaine?

02:08:01.007 --> 02:08:04.051
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

02:08:05.553 --> 02:08:07.054
Familiar?

02:08:07.847 --> 02:08:10.724
Oh, you're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

02:08:10.892 --> 02:08:12.351
I know.

02:08:12.852 --> 02:08:14.853
I'm just getting warmed up.

02:08:15.021 --> 02:08:18.607
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

02:08:18.775 --> 02:08:21.151
How about the thing you love the most?

02:08:21.652 --> 02:08:23.487
A smile from a jury.

02:08:23.654 --> 02:08:28.617
That cold courtroom
just giving itself over...

02:08:28.785 --> 02:08:31.995
bending to your strength.

02:08:32.663 --> 02:08:34.289
I get that on my own.

02:08:34.457 --> 02:08:36.208
Not like this.

02:08:36.376 --> 02:08:38.668
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

02:08:38.878 --> 02:08:41.088
I give you pleasure.

02:08:41.506 --> 02:08:42.798
No strings!

02:08:42.965 --> 02:08:44.758
Freedom, baby...

02:08:44.926 --> 02:08:47.677
is never having to say you're sorry.

02:08:48.930 --> 02:08:50.639
This is revolution, Kevin.

02:08:53.518 --> 02:08:58.230
It happened in Monterey

02:08:58.773 --> 02:09:01.316
A long time ago

02:09:01.484 --> 02:09:03.026
Forget about him.

02:09:03.736 --> 02:09:05.195
This is about us.

02:09:06.739 --> 02:09:08.740
In old Mexico

02:09:10.701 --> 02:09:16.331
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips as red as wine

02:09:16.499 --> 02:09:19.668
You don't know how hard it's been
for me to wait for you.

02:09:20.253 --> 02:09:22.087
Why the law?

02:09:22.839 --> 02:09:25.382
Cut the shit, Dad. Why lawyers?
Why the law?

02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:29.761
Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

02:09:30.763 --> 02:09:35.934
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

02:09:36.102 --> 02:09:38.895
Did you know there are more students
in law school...

02:09:39.063 --> 02:09:40.981
than lawyers walking the Earth?

02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:42.858
We're coming out...

02:09:43.025 --> 02:09:44.985
guns blazing!

02:09:46.529 --> 02:09:48.113
The two of you...

02:09:48.281 --> 02:09:52.159
all of us, acquittal after
acquittal after acquittal...

02:09:52.326 --> 02:09:56.037
until the stench of it reaches
so high and far into Heaven...

02:09:56.205 --> 02:09:59.624
it chokes the whole fucking lot of them.

02:10:01.627 --> 02:10:03.753
In the Bible, you lose.

02:10:05.047 --> 02:10:07.048
We're destined to lose, Dad.

02:10:07.216 --> 02:10:10.051
Consider the source, son.

02:10:11.179 --> 02:10:12.220
Besides...

02:10:12.388 --> 02:10:14.055
we'll write our own book.

02:10:14.223 --> 02:10:16.558
Chapter one.

02:10:17.226 --> 02:10:19.478
Right here. This altar.

02:10:20.146 --> 02:10:21.646
This moment.

02:10:21.814 --> 02:10:23.440
Will you stop talking?

02:10:23.608 --> 02:10:25.400
You talk too much.

02:10:25.568 --> 02:10:27.444
Both of you.

02:10:28.196 --> 02:10:29.905
Kevin.

02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:31.907
Look at me.

02:10:32.825 --> 02:10:34.701
Just look at me.

02:10:43.586 --> 02:10:47.881
Oh. She is really stunning.

02:10:53.095 --> 02:10:54.804
Who am I?

02:11:14.534 --> 02:11:17.786
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:29.839
The virtue of the devil is in his loins.

02:11:33.511 --> 02:11:34.761
What about love?

02:11:38.891 --> 02:11:40.183
Overrated.

02:11:40.351 --> 02:11:46.314
Biochemically no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

02:11:46.482 --> 02:11:51.486
Hey. In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

02:11:51.654 --> 02:11:53.029
Come here.

02:11:54.448 --> 02:11:56.449
She's right, my son.

02:12:03.374 --> 02:12:07.794
It's time to step up
and take what's yours.

02:12:12.174 --> 02:12:13.842
You're right.

02:12:15.803 --> 02:12:17.304
It's time.

02:12:17.763 --> 02:12:20.140
Free will, right?

02:12:24.687 --> 02:12:26.062
No!

02:12:26.731 --> 02:12:29.941
- No!
- No!

02:12:31.694 --> 02:12:35.363
No!

02:12:39.744 --> 02:12:43.246
Damn you!

02:12:44.665 --> 02:12:46.541
Enough!

02:12:48.628 --> 02:12:51.171
Haven't I given enough?

02:13:55.194 --> 02:13:56.820
It was a nice run, Kev.

02:13:56.987 --> 02:13:59.114
Had to close out someday.

02:13:59.782 --> 02:14:01.241
Nobody wins them all.

02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:52.834
What are you doing, baby?

02:14:54.837 --> 02:14:56.296
Are you okay?

02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:01.301
I am now.

02:15:04.513 --> 02:15:06.097
All rise.

02:15:06.515 --> 02:15:10.101
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds
presiding.

02:15:12.521 --> 02:15:14.522
Please be seated.

02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:20.779
You're still under oath, young lady.

02:15:23.908 --> 02:15:26.451
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

02:15:37.046 --> 02:15:38.546
Mr. Lomax?

02:15:43.219 --> 02:15:44.427
Your Honor...

02:15:46.222 --> 02:15:48.264
I'm terribly sorry.

02:15:49.558 --> 02:15:51.976
But I can no longer represent my client.

02:15:54.855 --> 02:15:56.773
I need to be replaced as counsel.

02:15:56.982 --> 02:16:00.109
Order. Order! Order!

02:16:00.277 --> 02:16:02.320
I adjourn this court.

02:16:02.488 --> 02:16:05.990
This is outrageous. Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

02:16:06.158 --> 02:16:07.367
I am, sir.

02:16:07.535 --> 02:16:11.120
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

02:16:11.288 --> 02:16:14.999
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

02:16:16.085 --> 02:16:17.836
I trusted you to defend me.

02:16:18.003 --> 02:16:20.171
You swore you would. You'll burn for this.

02:16:20.339 --> 02:16:22.924
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life.

02:16:23.968 --> 02:16:26.469
Baby, what are you doing?

02:16:29.557 --> 02:16:31.349
The right thing.

02:16:31.517 --> 02:16:33.809
I think the right thing.

02:16:37.064 --> 02:16:38.106
Here they are.

02:16:38.273 --> 02:16:40.441
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

02:16:40.609 --> 02:16:43.152
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:45.572
Ain't it better to talk
to them all at once?

02:16:45.739 --> 02:16:47.281
Press conference tomorrow?

02:16:47.491 --> 02:16:50.785
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

02:16:50.995 --> 02:16:52.245
That's it.

02:16:52.454 --> 02:16:54.121
This is the story you dreamed about.

02:16:54.331 --> 02:16:56.790
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

02:16:57.001 --> 02:17:00.335
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge.

02:17:00.546 --> 02:17:04.173
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

02:17:04.341 --> 02:17:08.261
- Wait a second. Can they do that?
- Not when I get through with the story.

02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:10.805
You got to give me an exclusive.

02:17:10.973 --> 02:17:14.642
This is wire service. This is 60 Minutes.

02:17:14.852 --> 02:17:18.521
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

02:17:18.689 --> 02:17:20.481
You're a star.

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:25.820
Baby.

02:17:27.323 --> 02:17:29.824
Call me in the morning.

02:17:30.409 --> 02:17:33.661
You got it. First thing.

02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:36.080
Bye, Larry.

02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:44.088
Vanity.

02:17:44.255 --> 02:17:47.049
Definitely my favorite sin.
