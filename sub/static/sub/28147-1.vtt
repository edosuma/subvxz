[Cody] <i> There. You see him?</i>
<i>Vig's there. Right there.</i>

00:45.629 --> 00:47.839
<i>Stop the car.
Stop the fucking car.</i>

00:53.387 --> 00:54.304
Cody!

00:54.721 --> 00:55.639
[gunshot]

00:55.722 --> 00:56.640
Hey!

00:56.723 --> 00:57.849
Come on. Cody.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.060
Cody, come on!

01:01.186 --> 01:03.146
Hey, hey!

01:05.607 --> 01:06.441
Cody!

01:11.655 --> 01:12.531
[Cody] Hey!

01:12.614 --> 01:13.490
Freeze!

01:13.574 --> 01:14.449
[gunshot]

01:14.533 --> 01:15.951
Motherfucker!

01:16.618 --> 01:18.745
[car alarm wailing]

[car alarm beeping]

01:35.595 --> 01:36.471
[woman screaming]

01:39.182 --> 01:40.100
No, fuck!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.354
Cody, Cody?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.449
[heavy breathing]

01:55.532 --> 01:56.617
Oh, fuck.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.160
Hang in there, buddy.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.583
Hey, hey, it's me.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.917
Where are you hit?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.586
Hey, how bad is it? How bad?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.420
Anterior vena cava, bro.

02:09.755 --> 02:10.631
[groaning]

02:10.714 --> 02:12.090
Let me see. Let me see.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.258
Jesus Christ!

02:14.009 --> 02:15.177
Look at her, man.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.345
He killed that girl.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.263
- That son of a bitch.
- Hey, save your energy.

02:18.347 --> 02:19.640
Oh, fuck.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.893
Lacy, Lacy.
You gotta take care of Lacy.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.728
- I got it. Don't worry about her. OK?
- Yeah.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.896
- Don't worry about her.
- Yeah.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.731
How'd you get the fuck into this?
What happened?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.858
- Tell me. What happened?
- Toro, man.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.568
Toro.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.989
I took something from him.
I took something from him.

02:37.115 --> 02:37.949
POLICE

02:38.575 --> 02:40.327
[sirens wailing]

02:40.410 --> 02:42.079
What are you saying? What are you saying?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.498
Bro, we're friends.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.169
- We did some stupid shit together.
- Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.381
[tires squealing]

02:56.676 --> 02:57.594
Tell John...

02:58.637 --> 03:01.556
[stammering] Tell John
I left something for him.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.058
What? Where?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.684
Tell me. Come on, Cody, where?

03:05.185 --> 03:06.186
John'll know.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.605
John always knows.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.320
Enough, enough.
Come on. I got you, I got you.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.906
- Tell John... Tell him I'm sorry.
- Enough.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.242
It had to be...

03:20.992 --> 03:22.369
the hard way.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.001
Fuck.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.757
I got you, buddy.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.219
Fuck.

03:43.640 --> 03:44.516
Fuck!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.893
[tires squealing]

03:52.566 --> 03:54.651
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:28.977 --> 04:30.395
[jazz music playing]

04:34.065 --> 04:35.484
[faint electronic beeping]

04:44.409 --> 04:45.869
[in sign language] Where's this guy?

04:47.537 --> 04:50.499
Name's Ivo. From the Ukraine.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.626
He's pretty good.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.254
But he's done in six moves.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.883
Make that four.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.761
[electronic beeping]

05:08.683 --> 05:10.852
You know, a closed mouth
don't get fed, right?

05:12.229 --> 05:15.190
Yeah, you. What's on your mind, neph?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.608
Speak on it, and then dump the trash,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.319
and lock the back door
like I asked you to a half hour ago.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.278
It's just...

05:20.779 --> 05:23.448
I grew up hearing
all these stories about you.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.158
And I watch you
playing chess with someone--

05:25.242 --> 05:27.702
And it doesn't seem to match up
with the dapper dressing,

05:27.786 --> 05:30.205
golf and chess-playing negro
you see before you?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.414
I mean...

05:32.207 --> 05:37.462
Afghanistan, special ops, all those
crazy black Rambo Fallujah stories,

05:37.546 --> 05:38.880
all the street fighter stories.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.217
Look, people tend to exaggerate things

05:42.300 --> 05:44.636
because they have a need
to believe in "myths".

05:44.719 --> 05:49.182
But the truth is, I am no "Superman".
I'm not even much of a fighter.

05:49.266 --> 05:53.103
See, it's your Uncle Cody.
Now, he's the real bad ass.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.355
You'll see that when he comes back here
for good next week.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.108
And since he's my new partner at the bar,

05:58.191 --> 06:01.319
you'll get a chance to hear
all of Uncle Cody's tall tales first-hand.

06:01.444 --> 06:04.197
But for now, you need to
dump the trash like I asked you to,

06:04.281 --> 06:05.615
so I can get you back home.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.617
Because I do not want to hear
my sister's mouth

06:07.701 --> 06:08.994
for keeping you out too late.

06:10.412 --> 06:12.038
[door thumping]

06:17.252 --> 06:20.755
Our beloved Carmine's
is now a fucking mooley hipster joint.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.634
Hell, no! Not on my fucking watch!

06:25.176 --> 06:26.052
Who owns this joint?

06:32.726 --> 06:33.935
Tell you what.

06:34.978 --> 06:35.854
I'm a businessman.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.315
So, I offer 20K above what you paid,

06:38.398 --> 06:42.319
you pack up, set up in Bushwick
or somewhere the fuck else.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.778
And all is well.

06:43.903 --> 06:44.904
Capisce <i>?</i>

06:46.698 --> 06:47.741
No capisce.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.206
You gentlemen have a good night,
we're closed.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.959
Hey, asshole. Do you know who this is?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.003
Relax, Paulie, I got this.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.258
What's your name, wise guy?

07:06.635 --> 07:07.552
Payne.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.183
How fucking appropriate.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.312
Listen, Payne,
I don't think you fully understand.

07:17.395 --> 07:22.025
See, this place is what you call
sentimental value to my community.

07:22.108 --> 07:26.571
Many a great man
have drank, bled, and died here.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.740
Now, you take the deal

07:29.449 --> 07:32.327
before I take it off the table,
beat your ass with it.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.662
Ah, ah, ah.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.871
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.331
[electronic beeping]

07:36.790 --> 07:37.707
Checkmate.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.210
[electronic beeping]

07:42.462 --> 07:43.296
You know...

07:47.092 --> 07:48.468
I feel you on the...

07:49.010 --> 07:50.303
sentimental thing.

07:50.929 --> 07:54.182
You see, I know the pain of a son

07:54.265 --> 07:59.437
whose father was nearly murdered in a bar
he wasn't even allowed inside of.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.065
And for that man's son...

08:03.608 --> 08:06.319
to grow up and one day
own that very bar...

08:06.695 --> 08:07.612
You see...

08:08.029 --> 08:11.282
first... you should have
taken no for an answer.

08:11.741 --> 08:16.037
Second... you already fucked up by shoving
my nephew when you first came in here.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.163
I was gonna let that slide

08:17.247 --> 08:18.915
because he needs to
toughen up a little bit.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.711
And third... I heard that mooley comment,
not cool.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.966
Judging by your little jailhouse shuffle
and them fucked up clothes you're wearing,

08:28.049 --> 08:29.259
you've been locked up for a while.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.804
Well, let me hip you to a few changes

08:32.886 --> 08:33.804
since you've been gone.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.934
Faucets now come on by themselves
when you put your hands underneath.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.938
We've had a black and an orange president,

08:43.023 --> 08:43.982
and this...

08:45.608 --> 08:47.068
ain't Carmine's no more.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.409
- [Paulie] Yeah!
- [John] Oh.

08:54.909 --> 08:55.785
Uh-huh.

08:55.869 --> 09:00.999
You clearly have no fucking idea
of who you talking to.

09:01.082 --> 09:01.958
Hmm.

09:03.126 --> 09:08.882
And clearly, you do not understand
the degree of a fuck that I don't give.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.216
- Oh.
- Hmm.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.426
Huh.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.013
So... I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.390
I'm gonna break your jaw for you,

09:17.474 --> 09:20.351
lump you up for GP
and then toss your ass out the window

09:20.435 --> 09:22.979
because I've been thinking about
changing that window out anyway.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.609
I'm gonna sleep Paulie string bean
over here last,

09:27.692 --> 09:29.611
so he can tell you what happened to you.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.656
That's after the cops throw you
back in prison for parole violation

09:33.740 --> 09:36.659
on account of that .380
you're carrying on your right hip.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.206
But, hey...

09:42.290 --> 09:43.666
you were smart for coming strapped.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.798
But you made one mistake.

09:51.716 --> 09:52.717
Yeah?

09:53.468 --> 09:54.677
What's that?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.682
You let me get too close.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.570
- [Tony grunting]
- [foot thumping]

10:13.863 --> 10:14.739
[gun cocks]

10:16.699 --> 10:17.742
Catch, motherfucker.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.544
[Tony grunting]

10:30.964 --> 10:33.383
[Tony grunting]

10:40.807 --> 10:43.268
You stupid son of a bitch.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.186
You broke my jaw.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.441
No.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.485
No!

10:52.569 --> 10:53.570
[groaning]

10:56.489 --> 10:58.741
[car alarms beeping]

11:15.550 --> 11:17.594
[boy] I thought you said
you weren't much of a fighter.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.053
I'm not.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.098
Fighting is the violent exchange
of physical blows.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.393
It's technically not a fight
if I'm the only one giving the blows.

11:26.561 --> 11:27.604
Get a broom.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.900
Cops will be here soon.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.484
[phone buzzing]

11:33.568 --> 11:36.779
If you teach me how to fight, I promise
I won't tell my mom what happened.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.198
I told you I don't fight.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.075
Your Uncle Cody's gonna get you right.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.328
Payne.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.126
When?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.049
I'll be there as soon as I can.

11:58.259 --> 11:59.594
Thanks for the call, Arnold.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.601
Uncle Cody is not gonna be here on Monday.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.565
[police sirens wailing]

12:56.067 --> 12:57.902
[car horn honking]

13:36.149 --> 13:38.192
Mr. Briggs is waiting for you upstairs.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.033
[indistinct chatter]

13:47.035 --> 13:49.537
[Arnold] Make sure everything
is locked up downstairs.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.788
[man] OK.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.294
Arnold.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.380
Never expected to see you
in Europe again, John.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.174
Yeah, makes the two of us.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.217
Come on, I'll show you in.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.729
Updated a few things
since you were here last.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.189
Yeah, I see.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.071
How long you staying?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.075
Just until I bury Cody.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.286
[Arnold] You need anything, we're here.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.996
[John] I appreciate that.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.999
I'm making the funeral arrangements
for Thursday.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.584
[Arnold] Blanche and I will be there.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.337
[John chuckles] She's still putting up
with you after all these years?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.922
- [Arnold] Yeah.
- [John] Bless her heart.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.550
[Arnold] You're not bringing him home?

14:44.842 --> 14:48.096
He would've wanted to be laid to rest here
with the others from his team, Arnold.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.389
You should know that.

14:55.269 --> 14:56.813
Things change, John.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.898
You should know that.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.233
Yeah.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.402
You run the whole unit now.

15:02.985 --> 15:06.656
Not just the unit.
I run all the old units, John.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.116
I got the whole basket.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.909
Climate's changed since you retired.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.494
U.S., Israel...

15:11.577 --> 15:14.705
Hell, even the Brits trying to disavow us.
Shut us down.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.457
I don't want a problem with you, too.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.502
You ain't got to worry about me, Arnold.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.047
Well, I don't want to
relive the past either.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.383
Let's just take care of your brother.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.342
You good?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.262
- One hundred.
- Good.

15:29.804 --> 15:30.721
So...

15:31.722 --> 15:33.141
can you tell me what happened?

15:33.683 --> 15:35.184
Where do I start?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.979
[Mason] <i> Cody! Come on! Come back!</i>

15:45.945 --> 15:47.280
[woman screaming]

15:49.490 --> 15:50.741
[Arnold] <i> It was the girl.</i>

15:51.367 --> 15:52.910
<i>She was the last straw.</i>

15:52.994 --> 15:55.329
[car alarm beeping]

15:59.041 --> 16:00.918
[Cody grunting]

16:02.545 --> 16:05.548
Hell, even Cody's partner almost cracked
and he's seen some shit.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.300
[Mason] Cody? Cody?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.428
Fuck! Hang in there, buddy.
Hang in there. Fuck!

16:11.345 --> 16:13.097
Yeah, Mason Bellows, yeah.

16:13.181 --> 16:16.851
Yeah, based out of Africa.
Good soldier, bit of a loose cannon,

16:16.934 --> 16:19.520
but damn good sniper.
Him and Cody made a great team.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.190
So, what can he tell me
about the investigation?

16:22.273 --> 16:23.399
Stop it, John.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.948
Come on, man.

16:34.118 --> 16:38.873
Mason and Cody were part of a task force
created to infiltrate a new drug syndicate

16:38.956 --> 16:40.750
that's getting roots here
in Eastern Europe.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.668
Brutal as hell.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.587
But I don't think
they are even set up yet,

16:44.670 --> 16:48.216
that's why I signed ADS guys to it,
so I could supervise them.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.467
And?

16:50.051 --> 16:52.261
"And?" You're retired, John.

16:52.887 --> 16:53.971
You run a bar.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.098
Let's keep it that way.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.422
[lock clicking]

17:28.506 --> 17:29.840
[door creaking]

21:01.635 --> 21:02.887
My condolences.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.015
Vali Bibescu. Bucharest PD.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.809
I worked with your brother.
Cody was a great guy.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.436
Were you two close?

21:10.519 --> 21:13.647
As close as you get on a task force.
Me, Mason, Cody...

21:14.899 --> 21:17.401
Darling, would you please
wait for me inside?

21:17.985 --> 21:19.111
[man] You can go in, get off your feet.

21:19.195 --> 21:20.529
[woman] Yeah, sure.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.199
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.161
Look, I know your background.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.913
Everyone here knows your background.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.374
Either they worked with you
or Cody or both.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.544
There is more to Cody's death
than what it looks like.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.631
And it has to do with the murder
of his confidential informant.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.011
Let me get settled first,
handle Cody's affairs.

21:44.178 --> 21:46.680
I'd like to sit and talk with you
and Mason as soon as possible.

21:46.764 --> 21:47.598
OK.

21:47.681 --> 21:48.933
Thanks for coming, Vali.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.957
Just wanted to say
I'm sorry for your loss, man.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.753
You going back to New York?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.631
Nah, man, I think
I'm gonna hang around for a little while.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.593
Payne, I was there when they took him.

22:27.638 --> 22:28.597
"They"?

22:30.140 --> 22:31.475
A lot of devils in this town.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.770
Well, do you know where they are?

22:36.897 --> 22:37.898
Yeah.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.496
[eerie voice] <i> Do you feel it...</i>

22:54.164 --> 22:55.082
<i>on the wind?</i>

23:01.547 --> 23:02.715
<i>In the air?</i>

23:06.260 --> 23:08.304
<i>The gates are opening.</i>

23:09.597 --> 23:11.515
<i>Devils rising.</i>

23:18.397 --> 23:19.607
Wait for me by the door.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.653
Guys, there's a lot of heat still on us.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.531
You better keep an eye out
and call me for any problem, right?

23:27.615 --> 23:28.824
- OK.
- You got it, boss.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.723
[man] Who the fuck are you?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.354
[man grunting]

26:21.413 --> 26:22.873
[panting]

26:23.999 --> 26:25.709
[groaning]

26:36.428 --> 26:37.304
Fuck.

26:42.851 --> 26:43.852
Oh, fuck.

26:48.065 --> 26:48.982
[phone beeping]

26:51.527 --> 26:53.028
[phone ringing]

26:53.904 --> 26:55.280
<i>Vali, it's me.</i>

26:55.364 --> 26:56.740
I've got two problems
I need to get rid of.

26:56.824 --> 26:59.076
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Frankie's studio.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.662
- I was tailing Vig.
- Shit.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.289
OK, wait for me there. I'm on my way.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.415
Hey, come on, man.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.626
<i>I gotta get to the freezer.
Get rid of these two problems.</i>

27:07.709 --> 27:11.171
<i>- We gotta meet in the morning.</i>
- OK. I can meet in the morning.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.257
And bring the tape.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.009
<i>It's time we show Briggs,
blow this thing wide open.</i>

27:16.093 --> 27:18.136
- OK.
- Watch your back, Vali.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.346
Be safe.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.933
What are you doing up here?

27:23.016 --> 27:24.977
You just missed
an exciting round of board games

27:25.060 --> 27:26.478
with my sister and her husband.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.730
Sorry. Mason, about work.

27:28.856 --> 27:29.898
Hmm.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.652
Don't forget you have to drop them off
at the airport in the morning.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.530
- Their flight is at 8:00 a.m.
- Damn it, I completely forgot.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.490
Don't worry, I'll do it.

27:39.950 --> 27:43.161
And your daughter is in the middle
of one of her marathon showers.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.872
Let me get her, so she can say good night.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.957
- OK, I leave that one up to you.
- OK.

27:52.546 --> 27:53.755
[dance music playing]

27:59.636 --> 28:03.473
[woman] Roxy, come downstairs.
You've been in there for over an hour.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.433
[music stops]

28:04.516 --> 28:05.976
Be right out!

28:06.935 --> 28:08.020
[dance music continues]

28:12.482 --> 28:13.483
Sure...

28:13.567 --> 28:15.444
Hmm. OK, what do you wanna do?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.157
Mm. No.

28:21.074 --> 28:24.244
You don't seem yourself lately.
Ever since Cody...

28:25.287 --> 28:29.416
You know, I never like talking
about job in too much detail.

28:29.499 --> 28:31.293
I know, I know.

28:31.376 --> 28:34.755
Just try to enjoy the rest of the night.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.173
[people laughing]

28:36.256 --> 28:38.091
- [Anna] OK...
- OK. I will.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.593
[chuckles]

28:39.676 --> 28:41.678
- [doorbell ringing]
- [Anna] No.

28:54.608 --> 28:55.692
[indistinct chatter]

28:58.278 --> 28:59.404
[Anna] OK, um...

29:03.450 --> 29:05.369
I have no idea.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.287
Street lights are off for some reason.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.248
I'll go call the city.

29:09.915 --> 29:10.958
[doorbell ringing]

29:11.041 --> 29:13.043
OK. What's going on here?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.261
[women screaming]

29:24.680 --> 29:27.557
[masked man] Hey, Vali.
Guess what we are here for?

29:27.641 --> 29:28.725
Where's the money?

29:29.226 --> 29:30.143
[woman screaming]

29:30.227 --> 29:31.270
Where the fuck is it?

29:35.148 --> 29:36.149
[woman] Susan, don't!

29:36.275 --> 29:38.902
Susan, Susan, no, no!

29:38.986 --> 29:39.945
[man] Stupid fuck!

29:40.362 --> 29:41.196

29:42.489 --> 29:45.492
- [dance music playing]
- [Anna screaming]

29:51.331 --> 29:53.500
Help, no!

29:53.583 --> 29:55.669
Mom? Dad?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.012
What's going on out there?

30:10.267 --> 30:13.145
[Susan choking and screaming]

30:13.228 --> 30:15.272
[man 1] Make sure no one else is upstairs.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.356
[man 2] I got it.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.484

Come on.

30:47.137 --> 30:49.514
[grunting] Stop! Stop it!

30:52.225 --> 30:55.145
[sinister laughing]

31:05.989 --> 31:08.033
Damn, Mason, what the fuck?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.534
You're filling it up in here.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.787
Yeah, it's not me, sir.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.122
It's pretty fucking rough out there.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.376
Well, shit's a lot bigger
than we both thought.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.419
- Yeah.
- That has to end.

31:19.503 --> 31:23.131
I need you to tell no one,
and I especially don't want Payne to know.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.051
Sir, he knows the ropes,
and maybe he'll be able to help us.

31:26.134 --> 31:29.346
He just lost his brother.
He's gone through enough.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.305
Yeah.

31:34.184 --> 31:35.185
Well, shit.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.188
I want to see you in my office
first thing in the morning.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.023
You go silent for the night.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.360
Button it up. That's an order.

31:44.861 --> 31:45.904
Yes, sir.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.876
[phone beeping]

32:01.211 --> 32:02.212
Fuck it.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.173
[phone vibrating]

32:12.681 --> 32:15.642
- It's Payne.
<i>- It's Mason. We need to talk.</i>

32:16.101 --> 32:17.269
<i>When and where?</i>

32:21.314 --> 32:22.691
[dance music playing]

32:40.375 --> 32:42.252
- Hey, what's up, peaches?
- Hi.

32:43.336 --> 32:44.171
Hey, smiley.

32:45.672 --> 32:48.925
Hello. I'll take a whiskey neat.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.761
- Now I know you are a tourist.
- Is that right?

32:52.262 --> 32:54.848
- You're from States.
- What gave it away?

32:58.351 --> 32:59.811
Me? I'm Monica.

32:59.895 --> 33:03.440
Originally from Slovakia.
Came to Romania for school and stayed.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.733
I wanted to be a doctor...

33:05.817 --> 33:06.818
ended up as a dancer.

33:07.527 --> 33:08.653
Heard that story before.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.113
[male announcer] <i> All right, all right.</i>

33:10.197 --> 33:12.741

<i>Now, if you all could turn
your hungry eyes</i>

33:15.118 --> 33:18.038
<i>towards the main stage for the next event,</i>

33:18.121 --> 33:22.709
<i>we have the mysterious Sky
and her budding Angels.</i>

33:53.198 --> 33:56.910
Someone looks like
they may be in some sort of shit with Sky.

33:57.327 --> 34:00.372
Careful.
I heard she wanted to be a lawyer.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.250
Yeah. I heard that story, too.

34:07.337 --> 34:09.672
[Mason dialing]

34:09.755 --> 34:10.924
It's me.

34:11.007 --> 34:11.882
[Arnold] <i> Mason?</i>

34:14.678 --> 34:16.638
I thought I told you to go to ground.

34:16.721 --> 34:19.474
Yeah, I know. But I called Payne.
I'm about to meet him right now.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.393
Stop. Now I know I told you
to keep your mouth shut about--

34:22.476 --> 34:24.187
I know exactly what you told me, sir.

34:24.271 --> 34:26.523
<i>OK, I know it's Cody's brother.
That's exactly why I know I can trust him.</i>

34:26.606 --> 34:28.733
- Mason--
- I can't do this on my own.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.150
This is Mason, isn't it?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.777
[man] Hey, stop it!

34:33.112 --> 34:34.030
Isn't it?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.241
Yes, sir.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.659
<i>Good. Where are you meeting him?</i>

34:42.664 --> 34:44.583
New York? Is that where you're at?

34:47.543 --> 34:50.338
What?
You can't let an ex know where you are?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.632
Baby. Sky...

34:52.716 --> 34:55.260
New York is not good for you.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.219
Yeah.

34:56.303 --> 34:59.681
Baby, look... you are a flower.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.392
- Mm-hmm.
- And flowers don't bloom in the concrete.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.647
Yeah, well, I guess you're right.
I kind of like it here.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.108
You know, no hassle from the real world.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.026
Mm-hmm.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.529
Our fairy tale, I miss it.

35:15.071 --> 35:16.031
Yeah.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.699
That's your fault.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.161
See, you let me get too close.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.627
[whispers]

35:30.629 --> 35:31.504
Oh, yeah.

Hey, babe.

35:39.804 --> 35:40.972
Where is he?

35:41.389 --> 35:42.223
OK.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.938
Payne, thanks for coming.
It's good to see you.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.360
Wait a minute, John.
You didn't come here to see me?

35:55.028 --> 35:57.989
- Of course I did.
- Hey, I'll leave you with this.

35:58.448 --> 36:01.201
No way, no fucking way.
You didn't come here to see me.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.620
You came here for work, didn't you?

36:04.079 --> 36:06.039
- Babe...
- Look, forget it.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.124
Forget it. Fucking bastard.

36:11.378 --> 36:12.629
Same old problems?

36:14.714 --> 36:16.633
[man] Hi. Let's have a good time.

36:18.635 --> 36:19.969
Come on.

36:22.889 --> 36:23.765
Good to see you.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.103
Guessing you're here 'cause you wanna
know what happened to your brother.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.354
So, what do you know?

36:29.646 --> 36:30.563
Not enough.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.482
Well, let's start there.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.567
[man] Don't fight. Come on!

36:37.529 --> 36:38.571
It's about a girl.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.282
Always is, isn't it?

36:44.327 --> 36:45.245
[man] Let's go, let's go.

36:46.371 --> 36:47.205
Come on.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.877
Give me a minute.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.555
Please stop!

37:05.557 --> 37:06.391
[Sky] No!

37:09.436 --> 37:11.896
- Sky! Hey! You OK?
- John!

37:12.605 --> 37:13.440
John.

37:13.523 --> 37:16.151
Hey, you heard her, right?
Get the fuck out. Let her go.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.068
John!

37:17.485 --> 37:18.403
- No!
- Hey!

Hey.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.944
Let him be a hero, yeah?

38:00.028 --> 38:03.239
That money they paid you
to walk away and shut your mouth.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.993
Hmm. Have a nice day.

Hey!

No means no, motherfucker.

Now get your shit,
get this earless motherfucker

38:31.267 --> 38:32.602
and get the fuck out of here.

38:34.187 --> 38:35.605
Yo, man, your ear.

38:37.899 --> 38:39.943
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

38:40.985 --> 38:41.820
All right.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.405
- You OK? How are you feeling?
- I'm OK.

38:44.489 --> 38:47.200
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- OK. All right, now, go home, clean up.

38:47.283 --> 38:48.618
- I'll see you later, all right?
- OK.

38:48.701 --> 38:49.744
- Go ahead.
- OK.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.210
Hey, you OK, man?

38:57.293 --> 38:59.921
- I was about to come check on you.
- Yeah, it's all good.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.631
Somebody just wanted to lend me an ear.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.471
This is Macallan 25 from Luther,
our bouncer.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.640
Thanks, babe. Thank you.

39:13.643 --> 39:16.062
Right now, you're the only one
I know I could trust.

39:17.522 --> 39:18.398
Same.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.066
Hey, look.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.238
Your brother and I
were working the Toro case.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.447
It's all there, man.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.408
Now it's just me and Bibescu.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.368
Vali, yeah. I met him at the funeral.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.037
- He wanted to talk to me about something.
- For good reason.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.790
Look, Vali uncovered a tape

39:35.874 --> 39:39.544
of a hooker getting killed
by a scumbag, Joe Vig.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.130
He's a capo in the Toro syndicate.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.717
He's a dark, sadistic fuck.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.637
Anyway, the tape shows they handcuff

39:49.721 --> 39:52.015
her pimp to another hooker
barely out of her fuckin' teens.

39:52.098 --> 39:55.476
The sick fuck blows them both up on tape.

39:58.021 --> 40:01.941
Vali shows the tape to your brother,
Cody does not take it well.

40:02.859 --> 40:03.902
Goes after Vig.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.446
[Cody] <i> There, you see him? Vig's there.</i>
<i>Right there.</i>

40:06.529 --> 40:07.447
Stop the car.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.115
Stop the fucking car.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.450
[Mason] Cody! Hey!

40:10.533 --> 40:12.201
[gunshot]

40:13.661 --> 40:14.537
Freeze!

40:28.801 --> 40:30.762
[Cody grunting]

40:33.473 --> 40:35.558
[Mason] Cody! Come on! Come on!

40:42.398 --> 40:44.776
So, where can I find this Joe Vig?

40:47.570 --> 40:48.529
Behind me.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.586
Red shirt.

41:08.007 --> 41:10.510
You see that slimy fat fuck
he's talking to?

41:11.260 --> 41:13.972
- Tattoo?
- Mm-hmm. That's Frankie Fine.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.181
He runs a club for him.

41:15.264 --> 41:18.017
He's also got a dance studio
down at Postei.

41:18.101 --> 41:20.937
And Joe Vig, he comes in
every Monday, Thursday nights

41:21.020 --> 41:23.106
to check on the new talent
that Fine brings in.

41:23.189 --> 41:26.275
They say they're using the dancers
as drug mules for Toro.

41:26.359 --> 41:29.445
All the girls here, dancers, singers,
all of them looking for a way out.

41:29.529 --> 41:31.906
New, fresh fucking face they can use.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.950
Now, your brother said
he had evidence proving

41:34.033 --> 41:36.202
that Toro's behind
the whole fucking thing.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.664
Said he got mailed the evidence
by an Ash Polaski.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.333
Problem is, I think
your brother hid the evidence.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.086
I've been looking, and I can't find shit.

41:45.753 --> 41:46.963
[Frankie] Yo, yo!

41:47.046 --> 41:48.423
Uh, listen up.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.884
Any of you young ladies in the crowd,

41:51.968 --> 41:54.679
if you think you have what it takes
to be on my stage,

41:54.762 --> 41:59.267
come see me,
right here in the cabaret club.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.356
We have a meeting with Briggs
in the morning, Vali and I.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.275
We're gonna show him the tape.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.192
Here...

42:09.235 --> 42:10.236
Cody's gun.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.531
I hope you have better luck
finding what he left than I did.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.118
Listen, Payne,

42:17.577 --> 42:20.038
for real, you watch your back, OK?

42:21.039 --> 42:22.165
See you.

42:51.444 --> 42:52.403
What are you doing here, sir?

42:52.487 --> 42:55.490
What part of going silent tonight
did you not understand?

42:55.573 --> 42:56.991
- Fuck.
- So, what was this?

42:57.075 --> 43:00.119
A fucking social call?
You and John just blowing off some steam?

43:00.203 --> 43:01.788
Yeah, I guess that was it, sir.
Yeah, that was it.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.206
And frankly, I'm starting to feel

43:03.289 --> 43:04.999
I'm the only motherfucker
trying to solve this case.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.167
Enough!

43:06.250 --> 43:09.462
Look, this thing's turning into something
bigger than Cody's death.

43:09.545 --> 43:12.715
Bigger than either one of you
could possibly fathom.

43:12.799 --> 43:13.674
You got it?

43:14.258 --> 43:15.134
Yes, sir.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.677
[phone ringing]

43:18.262 --> 43:19.430
It's Blanche.

43:19.514 --> 43:21.641
I guess
you should take your fucking call.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.018
Blanche.

43:24.811 --> 43:26.854
I told you this case is a nightmare.

43:27.396 --> 43:30.358
Blanche, I know it's the holidays.
Don't you think I'd rather be at home?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.151
Give me a second, hon.

43:34.070 --> 43:35.696
Don't fucking test me, Mason.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.741
I'm out of fucking reasons tonight.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.787
I'm on my way home, babe.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.039
We're on the same fucking team, Briggs.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.005
We are on the same fucking team!

43:54.090 --> 43:55.341
What the fuck is that?

44:18.614 --> 44:19.448
Fuck!

44:22.243 --> 44:23.077
Fuck!

45:06.203 --> 45:07.121
Oh, fuck.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.041
[groaning]

45:29.518 --> 45:31.354
[eerie voice] <i> All around you...</i>

45:49.830 --> 45:52.833
Brother, your hiding places never change.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.928
Thumb drive. Nice.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.894
[Ash groaning]

46:16.649 --> 46:19.568
[Joe] <i> You had no business</i>
<i>to open your mouth about us, Ash.</i>

46:19.652 --> 46:21.278
<i>I thought we were amigos.</i>

46:21.362 --> 46:23.239
<i>But Cody says something different.</i>

46:23.322 --> 46:25.074
<i>Not to mention you pissed off Toro.</i>

46:25.157 --> 46:27.368
<i>You ratted me out, Ash.</i>

46:27.493 --> 46:29.912
<i>- Where's my money?</i>
- [Ash] <i> Please. Toro, please...</i>

46:30.997 --> 46:32.748
[Joe] <i> Take his lying teeth.</i>

46:32.832 --> 46:33.708
[Ash groaning]

46:33.791 --> 46:36.752
<i>Hold still, you idiot.
You almost made me rip out your tongue.</i>

46:36.836 --> 46:39.005
<i>And I've not come to that part yet.</i>

46:40.423 --> 46:41.799
<i>Should I go for another incisor?</i>

46:42.550 --> 46:46.095
<i>OK, OK. Hold still.
I'll just take your molar!</i>

46:49.056 --> 46:51.976
[Ash screaming]

46:57.189 --> 46:58.065
<i>Jesus, man.</i>

46:58.774 --> 47:01.902
<i>With all those teeth missing,
you look like a fucking jack-o'-lantern.</i>

47:02.445 --> 47:04.321
<i>Makes me want to
put a candle on his mouth.</i>

47:05.364 --> 47:06.532
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:06.615 --> 47:08.659
<i>Please, Toro, please.</i>

47:09.326 --> 47:10.911
<i>Consider this your first warning.</i>

47:11.704 --> 47:15.708
<i>Next time, someone else might be
on that chair that has to pay the Vig.</i>

47:18.544 --> 47:21.088
<i>- </i> [Ash] <i> Please, Toro! Please!</i>
<i>- </i> [man] <i> That's enough.</i>

47:21.964 --> 47:22.923
<i>No, no, no!</i>

47:35.895 --> 47:37.646
[muffled voice]

47:46.363 --> 47:48.157
[Joe] <i> You really disappointed me, Ash.</i>

47:50.618 --> 47:52.536
[Mason] <i> Now, your brother said</i>
<i>he had evidence proving</i>

47:52.620 --> 47:54.622
<i>that Toro's behind
the whole fucking thing.</i>

47:54.705 --> 47:58.125
<i>Said he got mailed the evidence
by an Ash Polaski.</i>

47:59.085 --> 48:01.712
[muffled voices]

48:06.675 --> 48:08.260
[Ash] <i> Please, Toro! Please!</i>

48:09.553 --> 48:11.347
<i>- </i> [man] <i> That's enough.</i>
- [Ash] <i> No!</i>

48:11.430 --> 48:12.932
<i>No, no, no!</i>

48:20.022 --> 48:21.690
[John] And what did you leave me on this?

48:22.483 --> 48:23.818
Password.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.960
<i>Right now, I'm not sure who I can trust.</i>

48:41.043 --> 48:42.586
<i>So much shit going on,</i>

48:42.670 --> 48:45.422
<i>I'm still trying to figure out
why they haven't come to kill me.</i>

48:45.506 --> 48:48.759
<i>I've got the five million
that Ash Polaski took from Toro.</i>

48:48.843 --> 48:51.387
<i>All of it,
for negotiating when the time is right.</i>

48:51.470 --> 48:54.265
<i>Before he died,
he gave me a key to a lock box</i>

48:54.348 --> 48:57.935
<i>stashed at Mogooaia Palace,
an old castle on the outskirts of town.</i>

48:58.018 --> 49:02.439
<i>In this situation, the only person
that I trust is gonna be my brother, John.</i>

49:02.857 --> 49:04.692
<i>I've hidden the key with this recording.</i>

49:05.442 --> 49:06.277
<i>John...</i>

49:06.944 --> 49:08.529
<i>I know you know what to do.</i>

49:11.240 --> 49:12.783
[John] Five mil.

49:16.495 --> 49:18.539
[indistinct chatter]

49:21.417 --> 49:22.501
Good evening, ladies.

49:26.213 --> 49:27.923
Gee, I hope I didn't startle you.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.800
Joe, what's up?

49:30.426 --> 49:32.970
The guy tonight at the club, back table,

49:33.053 --> 49:35.181
you both seemed to pay him
some really good attention.

49:35.639 --> 49:36.557
Who was he?

49:37.057 --> 49:38.434
He was just a customer.

49:40.477 --> 49:42.855
- Sorry?
- He was just a customer--

49:45.524 --> 49:46.609
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.069
Did I hurt you?

49:51.572 --> 49:52.907
You think I'm fucking stupid?

49:53.490 --> 49:55.159
Do I look fucking stupid to you?

49:55.242 --> 49:56.994
I asked you one simple question.

49:57.077 --> 49:59.246
- Joe, he's my ex, he came to...
- To what?

49:59.622 --> 50:02.416
To your rescue?
Breaking off arms and hands?

50:02.833 --> 50:03.792
Just a customer, huh?

50:06.587 --> 50:10.549
I believe you owe the house some money
that was taking off some patrons.

50:10.633 --> 50:11.592
Yes.

50:12.051 --> 50:12.927
I see everything.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.720
And so do the security cameras.

50:14.803 --> 50:15.763
Now, talk to me.

50:15.846 --> 50:18.724
- I don't-- I don't know anything about it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

50:18.807 --> 50:21.018
You see, you don't lie to me, bitch!

50:21.810 --> 50:23.062
Sky, run!

50:24.647 --> 50:26.106
No, not here, man. Go get them.

50:31.862 --> 50:33.030
This is gonna be fun.

51:18.033 --> 51:19.451
[Mason grunting]

51:19.535 --> 51:22.538
- Ah, fuck!
- Mason, what the fuck, man?

51:22.621 --> 51:25.249
[groaning] I gave you
the fucking keys, bro.

51:26.500 --> 51:27.710
Hey, get me up.

51:28.544 --> 51:29.837
Ah, fuck!

51:29.920 --> 51:31.297
What the fuck happened to you?

51:32.006 --> 51:35.801
Oh, you know, usual day.
I got hit by a car, fucked up by you.

51:36.427 --> 51:37.928
- Fuck.
- You could've knocked, man.

51:38.012 --> 51:38.887
I almost killed you.

51:38.971 --> 51:41.682
Well, join the line, man,
everybody's trying to do that lately.

51:42.516 --> 51:43.434
Oh, fuck.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.727
[sighs]

51:45.060 --> 51:46.186
Is that Joe Vig?

51:46.979 --> 51:51.317
No, he was still at the club when I,
when I left. It was someone else.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.068
Someone else, huh?

51:53.152 --> 51:56.280
Yeah, fucking guy in a cowboy hat,
I couldn't get his face.

51:56.822 --> 51:57.656
Toro, right?

51:58.532 --> 52:01.618
Yeah, it has to be.
He's a cold, heartless fuck.

52:02.953 --> 52:04.288
You're pretty banged up, man.

52:04.371 --> 52:05.497
Hey, you want a beer?

52:05.581 --> 52:07.082
Oh, yeah.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.959
Oh, fuck.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.587
[exhales]

52:14.798 --> 52:16.550
- Feet.
- Oh, yeah.

52:17.801 --> 52:18.927
Just like your brother.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.055
Cheers.

52:33.108 --> 52:34.318
Oh, fuck.

52:35.235 --> 52:36.820
Payne, I think they killed Vali.

52:37.696 --> 52:38.989
What makes you think that?

52:39.073 --> 52:40.991
He said we're gonna meet this morning,
he never showed.

52:41.075 --> 52:43.035
[Vali] <i> I can meet you in the morning.</i>

52:43.118 --> 52:45.454
Vali always shows,
it's just the way he is.

52:45.537 --> 52:46.789
He said he was gonna bring the tape

52:46.872 --> 52:49.458
about the girl and the pimp
getting killed.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.086
I called his cell phone. Nothing, man.

52:52.544 --> 52:53.545
Same with the house.

52:54.797 --> 52:56.298
[phone ringing]

52:56.382 --> 52:58.967
Listen, man, Toro tried to kill me twice.

52:59.510 --> 53:00.719
He thinks I'm dead.

53:02.304 --> 53:03.847
Vali would have been the last one.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.893
Nah, man, there's one more.

53:10.562 --> 53:11.688
Me.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.696
Tell me about this Ash Polaski guy.

53:19.780 --> 53:21.240
Ash? Yeah, I guess that...

53:21.824 --> 53:23.325
He was your brother's snitch.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.452
Well, at least he was
until they found him dead

53:25.536 --> 53:27.287
with a hole in his face
where his mouth used to be.

53:27.371 --> 53:28.705
Check it out.

53:29.498 --> 53:31.208
OK. What we got?

53:32.209 --> 53:33.377
[Joe] <i> Not too mention</i>
<i>you pissed off Toro.</i>

53:33.502 --> 53:34.586
Well, look at this.

53:34.670 --> 53:36.797
- That's Polaski. Where did you get this?
- From Cody.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.468
Yeah, it's enough to fry Joe Vig.

53:41.552 --> 53:43.762
I watched this thing
like a hundred times

53:43.846 --> 53:45.431
and there's nothing on Toro.

53:45.806 --> 53:49.476
You can't identify him,
his voice is disguised, he's...

53:49.560 --> 53:50.394
I'll tell you what he is,

53:50.477 --> 53:52.271
he's the same fucking scumbag
that ran me down.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.730
Look at that stupid hat.

53:53.814 --> 53:54.690
[Ash screaming]
- [man] <i> That's enough.</i>

53:55.691 --> 53:57.192
<i>- No, no, no, no!</i>
<i>- </i> [gunshot]

53:59.903 --> 54:02.948
Yeah, I've never seen your brother
like this before that night in the garage.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.534
Look at this.
So, so out of fucking control...

54:05.951 --> 54:06.994
wanting Vig.

54:07.911 --> 54:10.372
But he was determined.
You know how he was.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.668
Fuck, man. I miss him, man.

54:18.422 --> 54:19.339
Yeah.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.472
Cody ever talk to you about his girl?

54:27.890 --> 54:28.765
Lacy?

54:29.766 --> 54:31.685
Yeah, Lacy Love, all the time.

54:32.478 --> 54:33.729
How about her sister?

54:36.565 --> 54:37.858
[indistinct chatter]

54:37.941 --> 54:38.859
[girls laughing]

54:38.942 --> 54:40.736
- This place is good.
- Mm-hmm.

54:40.819 --> 54:44.281
Can we take a look at this last one
before you have to head back?

54:44.656 --> 54:45.741
- Yeah, sure.
- Please?

54:46.408 --> 54:49.119
But would you be upset with me
if I wait for you here?

54:49.203 --> 54:51.079
- No. Yeah.
- Yeah? OK, go on then.

54:52.664 --> 54:54.374
Love you for taking me to lunch.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.626
You're welcome.

54:56.376 --> 54:59.755
- I am going to ace that history test.
- I know you will.

55:15.687 --> 55:17.064
She looks just like you.

55:23.529 --> 55:24.446
You know who I am, right?

55:28.158 --> 55:30.118
How long were you and Cody, uh...

55:30.827 --> 55:31.995
Married?

55:33.455 --> 55:34.706
Just for a short while.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.209
I loved him.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.089
He wanted to save me, you know?

55:42.839 --> 55:43.882
Yeah, I know.

55:44.424 --> 55:45.509
But from who?

55:55.602 --> 55:57.854
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:57.938 --> 56:00.440
- [chuckles] I know you.
- Yeah, you do.

56:00.899 --> 56:01.817
Since you were this big.

56:03.151 --> 56:05.946
- Yeah, now I'm grown up.
- I see that.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.408
- You worked with Uncle Cody?
- I did, yeah.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.744
You doing OK?

56:14.371 --> 56:15.247
Yeah.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.207
Great.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.545
I miss him.

56:24.381 --> 56:25.299
Me, too.

56:26.758 --> 56:28.885
[Lacy] Frankie's the one
that dragged me into their world.

56:30.012 --> 56:32.055
Told me if I don't help them
recruit girls,

56:32.139 --> 56:34.474
they will destroy everything
and everyone around me.

56:35.017 --> 56:38.645
Joe Vig is crazy,
but Toro, he's the devil.

56:39.605 --> 56:42.399
It wasn't until I agreed
that I found out what they really do.

56:42.482 --> 56:43.775
Traffic drugs.

56:44.234 --> 56:47.654
I wanted to get out,
but Vig made it very clear that

56:47.946 --> 56:48.989
if I stopped...

56:49.531 --> 56:51.033
they'll go after Erin.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.995
My sister is 15, John.

56:55.829 --> 56:58.415
Who knows what they would do
to a 15-year-old girl?

57:00.375 --> 57:03.795
Is there a place you could take Erin
and disappear for a while?

57:08.133 --> 57:09.301
I tried that before.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.012
Toro did that?

57:12.554 --> 57:13.972
It might as well have been him.

57:15.349 --> 57:17.684
Vig does the hitting. It's his thing.

57:18.268 --> 57:21.438
They gave a few hours to see Erin.
I have to get back soon.

57:24.733 --> 57:26.443
There's a major shipment going out.

57:27.402 --> 57:28.987
Frankie has the girls.

57:30.906 --> 57:32.407
You should take care of yourself.

57:33.825 --> 57:34.701
Yeah.

57:35.410 --> 57:36.286
You too.

57:40.791 --> 57:41.667
[John] Thanks.

57:47.047 --> 57:48.090
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.049
- OK.
- Ready?

57:49.132 --> 57:50.008
Yeah.

57:51.969 --> 57:53.804
- [Erin] Are you OK?
- Yeah.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.764
Come on,
I'll walk you to the train station.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.270

59:04.708 --> 59:08.295
Yes. Smile. Smile brings money. Smile.

59:08.378 --> 59:11.089
Come on, girls. Bottoms up. Bottoms up.

59:11.173 --> 59:13.508
That's it, girls. Smile.

59:13.592 --> 59:15.927
OK, I want you to feel sexy.

59:16.011 --> 59:17.637
To be sexy.

59:17.763 --> 59:19.723
Mmm, mmm?

59:19.806 --> 59:21.641
Turn, down and...

59:21.725 --> 59:22.601
[door opens]

59:28.982 --> 59:31.026
Up. Yes! That's it.

59:31.109 --> 59:33.195
That's the money shot, yeah.

59:34.279 --> 59:35.113
Joe Vig?

59:36.073 --> 59:36.948
Joe Vig!

59:37.032 --> 59:39.701
What the fuck?
What the fuck is going on here?

59:40.160 --> 59:41.244
Joe Vig?

59:41.787 --> 59:43.163
Who the fuck are you, pal?

59:44.915 --> 59:47.542
- Joe Vig?
- Doesn't ring a bell.

59:50.629 --> 59:51.880
I don't remember who that is.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.926
- How about now?
- You know-- you know what?

59:56.802 --> 59:57.636
How about now?

59:57.719 --> 59:59.930
Can one of you bitches
call security, please?

01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:03.475
[grunting]

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:05.811
- [John] How about now?
- I-- I just run the club.

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.938
I don't get involved with dramas.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.399
Please, I hope you find
everything you need some other place.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:13.026
- Let's take a walk.
- No!

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.986
[choking]

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.782

- [woman] Up there! He's got Frankie!

Oh, no, no, no. Not hammer, please.

Oh, no.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.581
- Joe Vig?
- I don't know nothing!

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:09.249

[footsteps approaching]

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.141

Oh, fuck!

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.575
[Joe] Hurry, we don't have much time!

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:44.784
Move it!

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.620
Don't leave anything behind.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.622
Come on, come on!

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.373
Do you hear me? Move it.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.292
Pack it all, put it away now.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.127
Pack the stuff and move it away now!

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:05.805
[Frankie] Vig!

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.265
[shouting]

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.268
Fuck! You shot me! You shot me!

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:11.978
Son of a bitch!

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.873
So, you like to hurt women, motherfucker?

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.835
You must be upset about Sky and Monica?

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.215
They were a blast.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:49.849
Tough guy, huh?

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:52.477
You think you have the balls
to come here and get me?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.604
Do you know how protected I am?

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.529
You cops are all dead meat.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:05.532
You just don't know it yet.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:45.822

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:54.748
Motherfucker.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.418
You're lucky I don't have time
to torture your ass.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.253
This is better than you deserve.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:12.349
Please...

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.310
Please don't kill me.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.899
Look, I just run the club.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.361
Everything you see around here,
that man forced me.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:26.029
- I swear it.
- What man?

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:27.489
Toro.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:30.784
So, you've seen him?

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:34.537
He pops in and out from time to time,
but he's always covered up.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.039
That weird voice of his...

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:40.126
[eerie voice] <i> Frankie Fine.</i>
<i>You'll do as I say.</i>

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.757
- He only comes here for Lacy. Please.
- Lacy Love?

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.177
That man is obsessed with her.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.263
He'll never let her go.
Lacy will tell you.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:55.225
- [Frankie groaning]
- [John] Shut the fuck up.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.644
[Frankie groaning]

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.686
Go. Get in there!

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.109
You're Toro's girl?

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.026
What?

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:07.028
- No.
- Tell him that.

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.740
You have to believe me, John.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:11.950
I loved Cody.

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:14.369
Toro, he's crazy.
He thinks I'm his, and I never...

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:18.540
I swear to you.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:26.172
OK.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:30.885
OK, I'll help you get out from under this,
but I know you know who Toro is.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:34.264
So, I want you to set up a meeting for me,
tonight at 8:00

01:05:34.347 --> 01:05:37.600
at Mogooaia Palace
right outside the city.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.269
Tell him I have his five mil,

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:42.397
tell him Joe Vig is dead,
Frankie Fine is dead...

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.898
[groaning]

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.442
All he has to bring is you.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:49.529
Tell him the trade is you for the money.
That's the only way he's gonna come.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.573
Now you say you loved Cody, right?

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.909
Then you'll do this for me.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:58.079
Oh, and tell him...

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:01.875
if he fucks with me,
I'm gonna send his ass home.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.678
Oh. Hey.

01:06:14.429 --> 01:06:16.681
I was just about to call you
about Christmas dinner next week,

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:17.891
you think you can make it?

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.851
Hey, hey, um...

01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:23.146
Arnold, I need your help, man.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.690
I just set up a meeting with Toro.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:27.484
- Toro?
- Yeah.

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:28.735
That's impossible.

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:33.656
Look, I came across something Toro wants.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.410
I'd like to make a deal with him,
but I need backup, OK?

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:38.369
See, Arnold,

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:41.581
I just want to give Toro what he wants
and free Cody's wife.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.584
- That's all I want.
- Toro has no connection to Cody's death.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.753
You're mixing up two different things.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:49.631
All this stuff with Lacy Love and... I...

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.758
Arnold, I just, I just need your help.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.552
Just you, and some of the old ADS guys

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.013
to cover my six,
while I make the exchange.

01:06:57.889 --> 01:07:00.141
Hey, you could have all the credit
once we catch Toro.

01:07:00.225 --> 01:07:02.602
I just need her out.
That's it. That's the deal.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.533
Briggs is out. It's just us.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:22.455
You sure you're down for this?

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:26.125
Cody's dead, Payne.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.835
Team's dead.

01:07:29.003 --> 01:07:31.130
It's just you and me, so, yeah, I'm down.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:32.632
When and where?

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.552
And how many of these motherfuckers
do I get to kill?

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:07.375
[John] <i> Mogooaia Palace.</i>

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:12.046
<i>An ancient palace with deep roots
to the history of the region.</i>

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:17.594
<i>Built over a hole in the ground
that they called the Gate to Hell.</i>

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:23.265
<i>The hole's said to be so deep
that no one could see the bottom.</i>

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:29.354
<i>Since then, they say animal-human hybrids
were reported to have crawled out of it,</i>

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:33.651
<i>and dark-winged otherworldly creatures
flew in the vicinity.</i>

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:39.490
<i>If this is the gate to hell,
it's time to slam that fucking thing shut.</i>

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.528
[Mason] Payne, I have visual on you,
you're covered.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:09:59.779
You find high ground?

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:02.073
[Mason] <i> Affirmative.</i>

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:08.496
Payne, we got bogeys.

01:10:09.330 --> 01:10:10.623
<i>Two vans and a car.</i>

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.461
But they're breaking off.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:18.172
- <i>They're flanking us.</i>
- Yeah, I figured that.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:19.632
Keep me posted.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.698
One van headed to you.
Lost visual on the other two.

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:46.534
Moving.

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:51.748
Check your position. Ready?

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:19.358
OK. Got eyes on the other two players.
Pulling up to you now.

01:11:26.824 --> 01:11:28.284
About six on foot on the ground.

01:11:29.035 --> 01:11:31.746
<i>- I need you to spot 'em for me.</i>
- [John] Affirmative.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:48.429
[Mason] Payne...

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:49.514
<i>Toro.</i>

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.270
Payne, I'm made.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.606
On the move.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:04.153
[Toro] Payne!

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:07.990
You wanted to deal with me?
I'm right here.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:11.160
And I brought your brother's little whore,
just like you asked.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.870
[Lacy whimpering]

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:17.500
I know you're out there somewhere,
hovering among the dead.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.920
<i>- </i> [man 1] <i> Anything along the outer wall?</i>
<i>- </i> [man 2] <i> Negative.</i>

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.713
[man 2] <i> Moving to the south of the palace.</i>

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:23.631
[man 1] <i> Copy.</i>

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.510
[Toro] You out there, Payne?

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:29.595
Among the dead?

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:33.057
[laughing] A fitting grave for John Payne

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.017
who walks among the dead.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.019
Did you know that, John?

01:12:37.895 --> 01:12:40.565
John Payne walks among the dead.

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.066
Did you know that?

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.610
How did you know that, Toro?

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:52.410
Coward. Come out.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.413
[man 2] <i> Still no sign of him.</i>
<i>The outer wall is clear.</i>

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.999
[man 3] <i> Wait. Sir, we have something.</i>

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.668
<i>We spotted a shooter
in the north-east mezzanine.</i>

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:03.212
- You set yet?
- Payne, I got him painted.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.714
Say the word.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.633
[Toro] Payne! You wanted me and I'm here.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:08.801
Take the shot.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:10.970
This is for his family.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:18.895
Fuck.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:23.900
This is for Monica.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:26.694
[grunting]

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.707
[screaming]

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:40.958
You can't hide, motherfucker.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:43.711
That's for Vali.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:48.341
And this is for his family.

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.220
Too late for running.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.203
[Mason] Fuck.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.083
All right, Toro. Let's do this.

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.126
[Toro] Where's my money, Payne?

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:27.213
It's in the chapel.
Let her go and I'll take you to it.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:32.635
It's in a briefcase. Five million euro.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:34.929
- Fuck.
- [John] Let her go.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.640
And I'll show you where it is.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.518
How do I know
you're not lying about what's inside?

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:44.230
I get the money, you get the girl.

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.816
I drew him out. Do you have a shot?

01:14:47.525 --> 01:14:48.818
[Mason] I got him.

01:14:48.901 --> 01:14:50.945
I got you painted, motherfucker.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:52.863
[man 1] <i> Sir, we have the shooter located.</i>

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:59.286
[Toro] Finally.
Take them both out and end this.

01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:01.247
John, look out!

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:08.421
Lacy!

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.434
Briggs.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:23.644
Your own fucking men.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.581
[Mason] You got bogeys on your left.

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.991
[door opens]

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:40.971
[Arnold] Payne.

01:16:43.557 --> 01:16:44.642
It's over.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:47.103
Throw the weapon in the pit.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:00.825
[John] Nice trick, Arnold.

01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:01.909
Where is the case?

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.007
So...

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.802
what's going to be the story
this time, Arnold?

01:17:19.885 --> 01:17:22.847
No story necessary, John. I'm done.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:25.683
Everybody's dead. Including Lacy.

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:28.060
I'm gonna collect my five million
and disappear.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.020
Now, hand over the case.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:32.231
Oh, you're gonna disappear, all right.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.900
You know,
I already figured out it was you.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.027
How long have you known?

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:40.072
[John] <i> Well, the hat was cute.</i>

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:47.163
<i>But not many people are running around
with a pearl-handled 1911</i>

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:49.540
<i>with our old unit insignia on it.</i>

01:17:53.544 --> 01:17:54.670
Not too smart, Arnold.

01:17:55.671 --> 01:17:56.881
What are you thinking?

01:17:56.964 --> 01:18:00.134
Think you're just gonna disappear?
How do you think this is gonna end?

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:02.970
"John 'The Legend' Payne,
killed in action."

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.556
"Toro evades authorities."

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:08.642
Sucks, 'cause I was damn close
to getting him.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:11.312
Now hand it over, Payne.

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.126
Looking for me?

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.255
Oh, yeah.
I'll gut you just like I did Vali.

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:46.430
<i>...just like I did Vali.</i>

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.350
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:51.018
<i>Tear Vali's home apart.</i>

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.895
<i>Just find my money.</i>

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:16.377
Why did you do it, Arnold?

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.880
You had the whole unit running around
in circles, coming up empty.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:22.049
You could've reassigned everybody.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.385
Why didn't you just do that?
Why kill them?

01:19:24.468 --> 01:19:25.970
Why Cody?

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.389
She loved him.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.059
I wanted her to love me.

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:35.437
Simple. He had to go.

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:39.858
That wasn't business.
That, my old friend, was truly personal.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:52.830
What about Vali's family?

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:53.747
His kids?

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:54.832
Give me the goddamn case!

01:19:54.915 --> 01:19:55.791
They all had to die

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:57.626
because of your obsession
with a woman that you couldn't have?

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.086
All pawns, John.

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:10.764
I got tired of being a pawn
in somebody else's game.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:12.474
Decided to run one of my own.

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:15.102
Now save me the trouble
of wiping the blood off that

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.562
and throw me the fucking case!

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.465
That's for Cody, you son of a bitch.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.217
[groaning]

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:52.181
Enough! Give me the goddamn case!

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:53.766
I know what's gonna happen.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.851
You're gonna try to shoot me,
but it's not going to stop--

01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:14.119
And then...

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:18.332
then we're gonna fight.

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:21.251
It's not gonna go your way.

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.056
Then...

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.643
I'm gonna make you pay...

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:43.273
for Sky, Monica, Lacy, Vali,

01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:45.401
his family and Cody,

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.486
with your miserable fucking life.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.536
Yeah, that's right.
You should have checked your ammo.

01:22:00.374 --> 01:22:01.333
<i>Before that,</i>

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.420
<i>you should've changed
the combination of your safe.</i>

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.020
You let me get too close, Arnold.

01:24:01.787 --> 01:24:04.331
[grunting]

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:07.084
[Arnold screaming]

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:58.093
[jingling]

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.056
I'll be with you in a minute.

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.808
Please sit wherever you want.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:27.581
What can I get you?

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:29.833
Well, hello, Adina.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.170
Well, I am Adina...

01:25:35.005 --> 01:25:35.922
Smith.

01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:39.635
Not to be mistaken with the other Adina
who works on the night shift.

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:41.470
That's good.

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:47.184
Yeah. My doctor says it's a good therapy.

01:25:47.267 --> 01:25:50.354
You know, going outside,
talking to people.

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:52.648
[sighs] Interacting.

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:55.359
That's good. I'll keep that in mind.

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.571
You mentioned a doctor, uh,
what happened to you?

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.991
An accident.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.576
A car accident.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:08.163
My husband would've killed me

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:10.582
if he heard me giving out
all my information like that.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.085
Sounds like a very smart man.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:16.129
He was.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:21.760
But he left me a gift.

01:26:31.645 --> 01:26:33.814
Um... Oh, wow.

01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:36.942
So, what can I get you?

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.819
I'll just have coffee.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:39.903
OK.

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:43.031
Oh, Adina, may I borrow your pen?

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:45.659
Sure, John.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:49.996
I'll be right back with your coffee.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.498
All right.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:14.938
Oh, and Lacy...

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:23.405
everything is gonna be just fine
real soon.

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:28.452
I'll be right back to take your order.

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:34.643
[John] <i> If you ever find yourself</i>
<i>passing through New York,</i>

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:35.894
<i>look me up.</i>

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.940
<i>The place that used to be called
House of Payne...</i>

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.317
<i>is now called...</i>

01:28:43.193 --> 01:28:44.194
<i>Cody's.</i>

01:28:45.445 --> 01:28:46.905
<i>Until then...</i>

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:50.116
<i>John.</i>

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:55.789
Cody would've wanted that, bro.

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:58.750
Yeah, and now it's done.

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:23.817
[John] <i> So, you're gonna stick around?</i>

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:26.111
I'm thinking about it. You?

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:29.656
Nah, man. I'm looking forward
to the peace and quiet of my own bar.

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:30.740
Right.

01:29:31.408 --> 01:29:34.035
Well, now I know where to get a free beer
when I'm in New York.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.245
Yeah, for sure.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:39.958
- What?
- Peace and quiet, huh?

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:42.836
Well, I heard you redecorated the bar

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:45.005
with a couple of goons,
before you came out here.

01:29:45.088 --> 01:29:46.089
Huh?

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:47.465
Zito brothers.

01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:49.801
Mm-hmm, I know.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:52.512
What I heard was
you beat one with his own gun,

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:54.055
the other you threw through the window

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:56.349
because you wanted to
change that shit anyway.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:59.436
And my favorite part, you told them
how you're gonna kick their ass

01:29:59.519 --> 01:30:00.770
before you kicked their ass.

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:02.522
Does that ring any bells?

01:30:03.773 --> 01:30:05.859
Well, you know,
people tend to exaggerate things

01:30:05.942 --> 01:30:07.402
- because they have this--
- Yeah, I know,

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:08.987
did you-didn't you have the fight already?

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:12.407
Fight. Well, hey, a fight
is a violent exchange of--

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:13.533
Listen, man...

01:30:14.492 --> 01:30:15.910
peace and quiet, my ass.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:19.414
You want that beer or what?

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:26.630
[Mason] So, ADS, they asked me
to take over from Briggs,

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:27.964
can you believe that shit?

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:28.882
[John] Oh, yeah?

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:32.010
[Mason] So, I guess if you ever get tired
of serving drinks, give me a call.
