WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:06.760
Agent Afloat, report to the fantail.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.580
Agent Afloat, to the
fantail on the double.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.710
Coming through.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.820
Make a hole.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.700
Look out.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.390
Anyone see him jump?

00:48.760 --> 00:50.160
- No.
- Anyone?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.186
Nice morning.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.596
Beautiful morning.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.616
How's, uh, how's your tea?

01:22.640 --> 01:25.196
Fine. Your coffee?

01:25.220 --> 01:27.990
It's good. Good coffee.

01:32.070 --> 01:34.896
- Quiet day, huh?
- Yeah. Quiet week.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.376
Got a call from DiNozzo.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.796
- Tony?
- When?

01:37.820 --> 01:41.700
Navy lieutenant did a half
gainer off the USS Seahawk.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.520
Talk to his wife.

01:43.550 --> 01:44.396
Does she know?

01:44.420 --> 01:46.156
She will.

01:46.180 --> 01:47.546
Shouldn't the Navy send a chaplain?

01:47.570 --> 01:50.106
Chaplains don't investigate, McGee.

01:50.130 --> 01:54.330
Right. Going to need a... address.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.326
It's going to be tough.

02:11.350 --> 02:12.336
You think it's hard for us?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.036
Imagine what it feels like to be him.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.206
- Who him?
- Tony.

02:15.230 --> 02:17.596
We're all here, and he's
still stuck on that ship.

02:17.620 --> 02:18.506
Not Tony, I meant...

02:18.530 --> 02:22.170
Completely alone, away from
all those who care about him.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.516
Wait, you weren't talking about Tony?

02:25.540 --> 02:29.520
No, I meant it's going to be tough
telling Lyndi Evans her husband's missing.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.310
Truck's here.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.210
So is she.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.630
It's freezing in here.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.486
After four months in the
subbasement, this is cozy.

03:25.510 --> 03:27.566
It's like March of The
Penguins down there.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.670
It's a nice place.

03:30.390 --> 03:32.670
Well, I mean, considering...

03:33.500 --> 03:34.636
Timothy.

03:34.660 --> 03:37.396
Sorry, Ducky, it's, uh, been a while.

03:37.420 --> 03:38.796
Yes, it has.

03:38.820 --> 03:42.236
Nasopharyngeal mucosal secretion.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.146
Snot? In her hair?

03:44.170 --> 03:48.450
Yes, well, perhaps it's a
souvenir left behind by her killer.

03:51.610 --> 03:53.546
Looks like we found the murder weapon.

03:53.570 --> 03:54.526
Toy guitar?

03:54.550 --> 03:56.536
That is not a toy guitar.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.546
That is a guitar controller used
to play Lords of Rock video game.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.826
That particular model is called an ax.

04:03.850 --> 04:06.656
So our killer is an ax murderer?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.166
Unlikely.

04:08.190 --> 04:12.106
This young woman's demise was
caused by blunt force trauma.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.386
For Abby, please.

04:14.410 --> 04:16.426
Thermostat was set to 40.

04:16.450 --> 04:19.255
Yes, and the chilled
air slowed decomposition.

04:19.279 --> 04:23.136
I'd estimate this young lady's
been dead for at least five days.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.956
Husband deployed five days ago.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.196
Battle on the home front
before going off to war?

04:27.220 --> 04:28.806
Room's a mess.

04:28.830 --> 04:31.376
Looks like a violent fight to the death.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.306
What tells you that, McGee?

04:33.330 --> 04:36.486
Broken stuff everywhere and
a badly beaten corpse, boss.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.826
No broken furniture, no broken
glass underneath the body.

04:39.850 --> 04:43.646
She died where she fell, then the room
was methodically trashed around her.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.666
Crime scene was staged to make
it look like a violent fight.

04:46.690 --> 04:51.530
Air conditioning was set on low to slow decomposition
in an attempt to disguise the time of death.

04:52.130 --> 04:54.350
I'm sure I would have figured that out.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.086
Eventually.

04:57.110 --> 04:59.216
You spent way too much
time in the cyber unit.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.360
Your crime scene skills
are getting a bit... dusty.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.476
Rusty.

05:03.500 --> 05:07.120
Here, McGee, see if you can
find something useful on that.

05:07.770 --> 05:09.430
That's odd.

05:09.460 --> 05:12.486
With the exception of the
severe trauma to the nose,

05:12.510 --> 05:17.010
the swellings on the facial
wounds are uncharacteristically low

05:17.530 --> 05:20.766
for this type of violent beating,

05:20.790 --> 05:23.836
suggesting that the
blows were delivered...

05:23.860 --> 05:26.120
Postmortem.

05:28.380 --> 05:30.140
Right?

05:41.430 --> 05:42.496
You need something, Abs?

05:42.520 --> 05:45.826
Nope, I'm just prepping
Tony's desk for his big return.

05:45.850 --> 05:47.676
Do you know something we don't?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.976
I just know he's coming back.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.400
I don't know how and I
don't know when, but Tony...

05:54.600 --> 05:57.000
is coming back.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.470
Hey, get a hold of DiNozzo.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.116
Tell him I want to see the records
of the guy who jumped overboard.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.986
Pull his service file.

06:04.010 --> 06:06.470
Got it, boss.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.386
Don't worry, Abs.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.966
Tony's deployment will be over soon.

06:09.990 --> 06:11.806
Maybe they'll transfer him back.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.140
Not maybe, McGee.

06:14.810 --> 06:16.780
Definitely.

06:23.230 --> 06:25.226
Husband overboard, wife murdered.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.846
That's a big coincidence.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.596
Not why you called me up here.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.586
You're a man down.

06:30.610 --> 06:31.486
Noticed.

06:31.510 --> 06:33.276
And you want DiNozzo back.

06:33.300 --> 06:36.556
Agent DiNozzo has three
more months on the Seahawk.

06:36.580 --> 06:39.616
After that, we'll
look for the right fit.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.100
Fits right here.

06:45.390 --> 06:47.486
Two San Diego agents.

06:47.510 --> 06:48.756
Both good men.

06:48.780 --> 06:50.990
I'm sure they are.

06:55.380 --> 06:57.486
You decide.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.170
Or if you like, I will.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.326
Zilch. Not even a toothbrush.

07:17.350 --> 07:18.876
You looking for something specific, sir?

07:18.900 --> 07:22.796
Yeah. The reason Lieutenant
Evans didn't bother to unpack.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.796
Guess he wasn't planning
on sticking around.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.270
Yet he flew all the way from D.
C. To Cartagena to join the ship.

07:30.630 --> 07:32.746
That make sense to you, Lieutenant?

07:32.770 --> 07:34.566
The guy was a head case.

07:34.590 --> 07:35.910
Thought you never met him.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.310
I didn't.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.446
Like I said, we stood different watches.

07:39.470 --> 07:42.176
But anybody who throws himself
off a ship has got to be crazy.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.076
What about your other bunk mate?

07:44.100 --> 07:46.426
Kaplan?

07:46.450 --> 07:48.916
Think he's got a touch of
OCD, but other than that...

07:48.940 --> 07:50.686
Did he ever meet Lieutenant Evans?

07:50.710 --> 07:53.076
I never asked.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.520
His watch is over.

07:56.050 --> 07:57.356
Where is he?

07:57.380 --> 07:59.936
Oh, baby!

07:59.960 --> 08:01.376
Vaya con Dios, fellas.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.796
I'm out.

08:02.820 --> 08:03.716
Okay, call. What do you got?

08:03.740 --> 08:07.090
Three seconds until the Agent Afloat
sees you're playing for stakes.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.506
Very subtle, Almeida.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.360
Agent DiNozzo. You want to sit in?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.856
Who's Lieutenant Kaplan?

08:14.880 --> 08:17.326
There he is, the guy whose
straight just got flushed...

08:17.350 --> 08:19.546
I need to chat with you
about your bunk mate.

08:19.570 --> 08:22.100
The mama's boy or Louganis?

08:23.810 --> 08:25.400
Tell me...

08:28.820 --> 08:31.036
Tell me about Lieutenant Evans.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.176
Only met him once.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.366
Logged into the COM
Room during my watch.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.336
You talk to him?

08:35.360 --> 08:37.606
Didn't get a chance
to. Left an hour later.

08:37.630 --> 08:39.826
Notice anything odd?

08:39.850 --> 08:43.530
Yeah. Evans. Guy was a nut job.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.910
Had that thousand-yard stare.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.686
Look, the guy called
it quits, took a header.

08:52.710 --> 08:54.156
What is there to investigate?

08:54.180 --> 08:56.930
Message for you, DiNozzo, from D.C.

08:59.730 --> 09:01.950
- Need that D5W, Henley.
- On its way.

09:02.430 --> 09:04.800
Dr. Feelgood, how goes it?

09:04.830 --> 09:06.206
What now, DiNozzo?

09:06.230 --> 09:08.866
Found another sailor you think's
faking their chronic pain?

09:08.890 --> 09:12.360
At ease, Nguyen. I've
suspended the investigation...

09:12.930 --> 09:13.766
for now.

09:13.790 --> 09:17.216
Yeah, well, because of you, I have to fill
out a report every time I dispense an aspirin.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.106
That must be quite a headache.

09:19.130 --> 09:20.330
I can open up a line, Doctor.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.166
I've got it, Henley.

09:21.190 --> 09:24.996
Well, I'd love to sit and chat with you about your
highly questionable prescription-writing practices,

09:25.020 --> 09:27.786
but I am here for Lieutenant
Evans' medical records.

09:27.810 --> 09:29.066
Guy who went overboard?

09:29.090 --> 09:30.946
Yeah, that'd be him, genius.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.026
You've already seen his records.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.336
And that's the wacky
nature of these cases.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.296
They're sort of like cheap
luggage... you think they're closed,

09:37.320 --> 09:41.726
and then bam, you hit a curb, lose a
wheel, and they open up all over again.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.096
Maybe you'll get lucky, Doc,

09:43.120 --> 09:48.350
and your little dope-dispensing caper
will stay locked up tight like a Samsonite.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.450
Have a good day, gentlemen.

09:51.830 --> 09:52.546
McGee.

09:52.570 --> 09:54.056
Trying, Boss.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.956
Just pull up his service record.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.080
Keating changed all my
macros. My keyboard short...

09:59.630 --> 10:02.116
All right, I'm pulling
it up on the plasma.

10:02.140 --> 10:05.590
ZIVA: Should we have Keating
sent up from the cyber unit?

10:08.530 --> 10:10.736
Lieutenant Chad Evans.

10:10.760 --> 10:11.966
Information Systems Officer.

10:11.990 --> 10:15.236
Completed security systems
training at Fort Mead, Maryland.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.216
Maybe if I reset the
native resolution...

10:17.240 --> 10:19.146
Just forget about it, all right?

10:19.170 --> 10:22.556
Received a Navy commendation
joint service achievement medal.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.796
Good officer.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.126
Bad saver.

10:25.150 --> 10:28.456
Five-star vacations, brand-new
truck, custom furniture.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.106
All charged by his wife.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.836
Pushed his plastic to the limit.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.756
Which may have lead to marital problems.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.776
Or murder. Gonna talk to
DiNozzo on the Seahawk.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.266
Tony? When? Now? Can I talk to him?

10:39.290 --> 10:42.256
Please, Gibbs, I just want to tell him that
Sister Rosita, she bowled a 260 last month.

10:42.280 --> 10:42.830
And I finally saw...

10:42.860 --> 10:45.700
Abby, it's not a social call.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.570
- Ziva.
- Want me to join you?

10:57.010 --> 10:58.570
Yes! Boss?

10:58.780 --> 11:01.910
I got it. I got it, boss. I got...

11:06.300 --> 11:08.070
Yes, sir.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.476
Hey, boss, you talk to Vance?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.216
No, I'm talking to you.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.586
Well, come on, you got
to get me off this ship.

11:16.610 --> 11:20.630
You have any idea what it's like to
be the only cop aboard a city of 5,000?

11:22.270 --> 11:25.616
Well, of course, you do, but
just in case you forgot, it sucks.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.396
Tell me about Lieutenant Evans, DiNozzo.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.676
It's all in the
preliminary report I filed.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.920
You just have to open up
your e-mail. I sent it...

11:34.020 --> 11:36.006
But you'd like me to-to tell you.

11:36.030 --> 11:39.276
Evans boarded in Cartagena
five days ago at 0630.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.126
We were underway by 0800.

11:41.150 --> 11:46.530
He reported for duty at 1900 that night but
left an hour later, claiming he was sick.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.866
Found his khakis and his I.D.on
the fantail the next morning.

11:50.890 --> 11:52.250
No body recovered?

11:52.280 --> 11:53.760
Not for lack of trying.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.456
There was an extensive search.

11:55.480 --> 11:56.346
Nothing.

11:56.370 --> 11:57.856
Medical records?

11:57.880 --> 12:01.196
Nothing that screams, "I'm gonna kill
my wifeand then throw myself overboard,

12:01.220 --> 12:04.896
but, uh," it's pretty
obvious what happened, right?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.936
Evans kills hiwife before he leaves.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.170
Then he joins the ship.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.036
Feels that he can't
live with what he's done.

12:10.060 --> 12:13.616
And then, he jumps overboard, which is what
I'm gonna do if I don't get off this ship soon.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.006
Boss?

12:15.030 --> 12:15.986
McGoo?

12:16.010 --> 12:17.256
Hey, Tony.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.066
Uh, Abby wanted me to tell you,
Sister Rosita bowled a two...

12:20.090 --> 12:21.990
McGee.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.886
We ran a check of Lieutenant
Evans' credit card charges.

12:25.910 --> 12:29.286
His card was used at a
bar in Cartagena, Colombia.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.706
That's where he boarded the ship?

12:30.730 --> 12:34.106
Yeah, only the card was used three
days after the Seahawk departed.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.380
I can hop a cod, be in
Cartagena in two hours, boss.

12:43.950 --> 12:45.066
Two good men.

12:45.090 --> 12:47.186
Two of my best.

12:47.210 --> 12:50.036
I put in a call to the Colombian
National Police in Cartagena.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.766
They're looking into Lieutenant
Evans' credit card charges.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.196
He could have lost the card.

12:54.220 --> 12:55.900
Could have had it
stolen before he boarded.

12:55.930 --> 12:57.946
Or Lieutenant Evans is still alive.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.016
Well, that's hard to imagine. They were
100 miles off shore when he went overboard.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.386
DiNozzo spent two weeks in
Cartagena doing threat assessments.

13:04.410 --> 13:06.950
He knows the city.

13:12.730 --> 13:14.086
One day.

13:14.110 --> 13:15.696
Then he flies back to the carrier.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.456
You didn't read these files, did you?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.926
Like I said, two good men.

13:19.950 --> 13:22.146
- Your choice?
- DiNozzo.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.616
You sent Ziva to Israel
to follow up on a lead.

13:24.640 --> 13:27.566
You sent McGee to the
basement to crack a code.

13:27.590 --> 13:31.266
There is no reason to
assign DiNozzo to a carrier.

13:31.290 --> 13:32.826
Seven years as an agent.

13:32.850 --> 13:34.436
I figured it was about time.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.200
You think he screwed the
pooch in L.A.? That it?

13:38.110 --> 13:42.490
You sent him to sea to punish him, Leon?

13:44.130 --> 13:46.610
Your choice is noted.

13:59.430 --> 14:00.676
Hey, Hector!

14:00.700 --> 14:02.760
Tony!

14:03.090 --> 14:05.880
So, how's the Juan Valdez of sugar cane?

14:06.300 --> 14:09.456
Better when I see a ship
with USS come to port.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.536
It's good to have you back.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.390
Well, it's just a quickie.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.630
Lorena... she's
not singing today.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.990
You ever see this guy?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.136
Used his credit card
here late last week.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.720
You know how many sailors
come into port last week?

14:30.720 --> 14:33.890
Yes, my friend, and
half... they come here.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.866
Lieutenant Evans, Hector?

14:37.890 --> 14:41.650
You could put his picture on the big
billboard, it makes no difference.

14:41.680 --> 14:46.496
$100 tip on a $50 tab... I think
that would be kind of memorable.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.506
I could always tell the policia you
were an accomplice to credit card fraud.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.056
Now, what they gonna do?

14:52.080 --> 14:54.516
I saw Romancing the Stone.

14:54.540 --> 14:56.896
Throw you in an alligator pit.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.220
Work with me.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.076
He was no sailor.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.556
Some mat_n paid me to
use his credit card.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.970
Mat_n have a name?

15:09.620 --> 15:12.696
I hate to see the Banana Moon
put on the Navy no-go list.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.206
Come on, Tony.

15:14.230 --> 15:18.990
I mean, a few hundred less cervezas a night...
That's really gonna cut into your bottom line.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.630
Think about it.

15:27.370 --> 15:29.360
Are we good?

15:59.980 --> 16:01.620
We're good.

16:02.700 --> 16:05.220
Where'd you steal the credit card?

16:06.080 --> 16:09.376
Tarjeta de credito, mat_n.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.976
I find it.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.060
Where?

16:14.150 --> 16:16.520
Over there.

16:18.980 --> 16:21.010
Come on, man.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.736
Look, man, I-I just took the card.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.170
He was already dead.

17:08.829 --> 17:09.796
Boss?

17:09.819 --> 17:11.205
DiNozzo.

17:11.230 --> 17:12.566
Found Lieutenant Evans.

17:12.589 --> 17:14.810
He didn't fall overboard.
He couldn't have.

17:15.359 --> 17:18.705
Judging by the smell, he was dead
before the Seahawk even sailed.

17:18.730 --> 17:23.756
Killer impersonated a Navy officer to get
on board a United States aircraft carrier.

17:23.780 --> 17:27.089
Yeah. We got a major
security breach, boss.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.596
Lieutenant Evans was killed
in Cartagena, Captain.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.490
Then who the hell boarded my ship?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.556
His killer.

17:42.580 --> 17:43.596
That's impossible.

17:43.620 --> 17:46.336
He used Lieutenant Evans'
I.D.to get on the Seahawk.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.810
Then he faked Evans'
suicide once he was on board.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.226
Which means, he's still on the ship.

17:52.250 --> 17:55.540
Captain, someone went to a lot of
trouble to become Lieutenant Evans.

17:55.570 --> 17:56.616
Why?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.596
What were his assigned duties, Captain?

17:58.620 --> 18:03.966
As an IT, Lieutenant Evans' area of responsibility
was to perform routine tests on the ship's security.

18:03.990 --> 18:05.806
But there has been no reported breaches.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.250
Not yet.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.806
I'll increase security on our
weapons systems and the reactor,

18:09.830 --> 18:12.756
and if the son of a bitch is
still on the ship, we'll find him.

18:12.780 --> 18:14.566
This will not be a manhunt, Captain.

18:14.590 --> 18:16.146
Last thing you want
to do is to panic him.

18:16.170 --> 18:19.746
Agent DiNozzo will conduct his
investigation when he returns to the ship.

18:19.770 --> 18:22.816
In the meantime, you might want to
start verifying your personnel...

18:22.840 --> 18:23.836
discreetly.

18:23.860 --> 18:26.110
Consider it done.

18:28.390 --> 18:30.396
Pack your bags, Agent Gibbs.

18:30.420 --> 18:32.880
Your boy's going to need some help.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.560
Good morning, Agent Keating.

18:52.630 --> 18:54.810
Keating.

19:02.430 --> 19:03.486
Agent Gibbs' desk.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.556
McGee?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.106
Tony. Back on dry land?

19:06.130 --> 19:08.426
Yeah. It's a tropical paradise, really.

19:08.450 --> 19:10.950
Just like The Blue Lagoon,
except no white sand beaches,

19:10.980 --> 19:14.026
magical waterfalls, and
definitely no Brooke Shields.

19:14.050 --> 19:15.306
I've got some good news for you.

19:15.330 --> 19:16.636
You're coming to relieve me?

19:16.660 --> 19:18.036
No, but Vance sent...

19:18.060 --> 19:18.896
Tequila?

19:18.920 --> 19:21.546
'Cause I'm going to need at least a case
to get through the next three months here.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.320
- Is that DiNozzo?
- Yeah.

19:26.580 --> 19:28.770
Everyone hates me. You know what?

19:29.630 --> 19:31.146
You better make it two cases.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.050
With Director Vance running things, I'm
going to be Agent Afloating into my sixties.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.520
How's it going with him, anyway?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.976
Oh, couldn't be better, DiNozzo.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.440
Ah, Director Vance. I was just, uh...

19:41.700 --> 19:43.726
just telling McGee how
much I missed everyone.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.540
Sit-rep.

19:44.570 --> 19:48.550
Federales turned Lieutenant Evans'
body over to the Cartagena morgue.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.086
I just paid a visit to the coroner.

19:50.110 --> 19:52.216
He's insisting on doing
the autopsy himself.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.856
We need that report.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.906
Well, that's easier said than done.

19:55.930 --> 20:00.220
This guy doesn't care
much for Americans.

20:01.460 --> 20:02.796
Unless it's just me.

20:02.820 --> 20:04.366
We'll find out soon enough.

20:04.390 --> 20:06.156
Gibbs and Ziva flew out last night.

20:06.180 --> 20:07.246
To Cartagena?

20:07.270 --> 20:09.626
Yeah, Tony. That's what I
was trying to tell you before.

20:09.650 --> 20:11.156
Well, when do they get here?

20:11.180 --> 20:13.290
Already have.

20:15.060 --> 20:17.160
Nice tan.

20:19.730 --> 20:21.620
Denied. Again.

20:21.990 --> 20:24.970
Didn't they teach you anything
down there in Cyberville?

20:26.380 --> 20:28.546
No cyber jokes. Got it.

20:28.570 --> 20:31.526
Extended firewalls, two
mirrored hard drives.

20:31.550 --> 20:34.956
Whatever Lieutenant Evans was
into he worked hard to cover up.

20:34.980 --> 20:36.826
Mirrored hard drives?

20:36.850 --> 20:39.670
Hope you didn't make plans tonight.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.906
Well, Ducky was right.

20:45.930 --> 20:47.556
- It's snot.
- It's not what?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.370
It's snot.

20:50.140 --> 20:52.176
- It's not?
- Yeah. It is.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.726
It's what?

20:53.750 --> 20:54.676
Snot!

20:54.700 --> 20:56.796
The substance found
in Lyndi Evans' hair!

20:56.820 --> 20:58.746
It's snot.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.950
Well, why didn't you just say that?

21:03.640 --> 21:06.020
Ooh, that's odd.

21:07.970 --> 21:12.586
Major Mass Spec has found a rare
spore buried in the killer's mucus.

21:12.610 --> 21:14.720
All I need to do now is find its origin.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.046
Yes! I am in.

21:17.070 --> 21:18.256
Already?

21:18.280 --> 21:22.920
All I had to do was tear down the firewalls and align
the virtual images with their true counterparts.

21:23.690 --> 21:25.806
Timmy got new skillz.

21:25.830 --> 21:28.410
It was a long four months.

21:33.890 --> 21:35.686
It still is, McGee.

21:35.710 --> 21:40.506
So, let me guess. You guys caught a bad case of
DiNozzoitis, had Vance to send you down south.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.576
DiNozzoitis? Sounds venereal.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.246
Okay, don't admit it.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.856
I know you missed me.
I missed you, boss.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.426
Yeah, I know, DiNozzo.

21:48.450 --> 21:50.620
Yeah, Gibbs.

21:52.430 --> 21:56.310
At work now. I understand...

21:56.700 --> 21:57.666
What?

21:57.690 --> 22:00.556
You seem, uh... different.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.046
Taller? Hotter?

22:03.070 --> 22:04.156
Older.

22:04.180 --> 22:08.180
Well, it's been over four months.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.016
You still beating
yourself up over Jenny?

22:12.040 --> 22:13.386
Not as much as I used to.

22:13.410 --> 22:15.146
Drinking?

22:15.170 --> 22:17.790
Not as much as I used to.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.086
You could have called.

22:22.110 --> 22:25.546
COD's on the way from the
Seahawk. You got an hour, DiNozzo.

22:25.570 --> 22:29.840
Okay. Listen, I was thinking maybe
we should let Ziva handle the coroner.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.720
I got a hunch.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.846
No, no, no, senorita, no
puede irse sin ver Cartagena.

22:37.870 --> 22:40.616
Hay muchas partes que son muy bonitas.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.476
Casi casi tan bonita como usted.

22:42.500 --> 22:46.860
Ojala pueda volver a Cartagena,
cuando tenga mas tiempo para conocer.

22:51.350 --> 22:52.600
Got a hunch, huh?

22:52.630 --> 22:55.100
The powers of observation.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.896
This kid took a hell of a hit.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.380
Trauma embotado de fuerza.

23:04.410 --> 23:08.700
Blunt force trauma resulting in the
nasal bone penetrating the brain.

23:08.730 --> 23:12.830
According to Ducky, Lyndi Evans
was killed exactly the same way.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.450
The same killer.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.436
The guy gets around.

23:16.460 --> 23:19.540
First he kills Evans'
wife, in Washington, D.C.

23:19.570 --> 23:23.140
then Evans in Cartagena a day later?

23:25.470 --> 23:26.746
Yeah, Gibbs.

23:26.770 --> 23:27.906
We got big news, boss.

23:27.930 --> 23:29.796
Huge news. Ginormous news.

23:29.820 --> 23:32.026
Like, like, maybe you
should be sitting down.

23:32.050 --> 23:32.776
Abby.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.746
Sorry. Speak, McGee.

23:34.770 --> 23:36.766
We ran through Lieutenant
Evans' e-mail account,

23:36.790 --> 23:39.660
found an ongoing correspondence
with someone in Singapore.

23:39.690 --> 23:40.246
Name?

23:40.270 --> 23:41.356
Well, we're working on it, Gibbs.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.870
The e-mails' full of code words and
jumbled ciphers, the whole shebang.

23:44.900 --> 23:45.626
And they haven't stopped.

23:45.650 --> 23:49.226
Someone posing as Lieutenant Evans
sent another e-mail a couple hours ago.

23:49.250 --> 23:55.796
And it contained references to both the USS Seahawk
and ciprofloxacin, the antibiotic used to combat...

23:55.820 --> 23:57.890
Anthrax.

24:35.830 --> 24:37.276
Welcome to the Bird Farm.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.006
It's great to be back.

24:39.030 --> 24:41.276
Completed the verification
of your crew, Captain?

24:41.300 --> 24:46.666
Matching FSRs against 5,000 souls
is not an easy task, Agent Gibbs.

24:46.690 --> 24:48.526
We're doing it discreetly.

24:48.550 --> 24:50.770
Damn near impossible.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.506
You get used to it.

24:53.530 --> 24:54.526
No, you don't.

24:54.550 --> 24:56.566
Status on security systems?

24:56.590 --> 24:59.926
A handpicked team of ETs is filtering
through any possible breaches

24:59.950 --> 25:02.996
in the ship's electronic
data and control areas.

25:03.020 --> 25:04.916
Are there other vulnerable areas?

25:04.940 --> 25:06.816
Water, supply, ventilation.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.576
We believe Lieutenant Evans' killer
may be carrying ciprofloxacin.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.500
To protect himself from anthrax.

25:17.960 --> 25:22.406
Are you telling me this guy might be
planning a biological attack on my carrier?

25:22.430 --> 25:25.140
That's what we're here to find out.

25:28.580 --> 25:30.496
This is the Captain. Get me the XO.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.416
This is where you have
been the last month?

25:32.440 --> 25:36.156
Yeah, it's just like the squad room,
only I'm the squad and there's no room.

25:36.180 --> 25:40.276
Captain, we need to talk to the officer of the
deck who let Lieutenant Evans' killer on board.

25:40.300 --> 25:41.356
Whatever you need.

25:41.380 --> 25:44.166
Officer of the deck cannot be the
only sailor who has had contact.

25:44.190 --> 25:44.846
She's not.

25:44.870 --> 25:49.596
Lieutenant Jonah Kaplan works in the communications
room where Bizarro Evans clocked in for an hour.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.206
Talk to him.

25:50.230 --> 25:52.016
I already did, boss.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.340
I'll talk to him again.

25:53.370 --> 25:56.300
Keep this as quiet as possible.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.736
What are those doing on your wall?

26:01.760 --> 26:03.546
How did those get there?

26:03.570 --> 26:06.520
Safety is our primary concern.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.566
I've ordered guards posted at the
vulnerable areas you're concerned about.

26:10.590 --> 26:15.696
I know you want to play this down, Gibbs, but
my first priority is the safety of the ship.

26:15.720 --> 26:19.890
You've got 12 hours, then
this becomes my investigation.

26:24.220 --> 26:26.866
McGee was specifically told
to destroy those photos.

26:26.890 --> 26:27.686
I guess he forgot.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.296
Then perhaps I should remind him.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.196
Go easy on the lad.
He's had a rough summer.

26:31.220 --> 26:32.386
Well, we all have.

26:32.410 --> 26:34.976
Well, I think it was
especially difficult for McGeek.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.066
He doesn't handle
change well. Never has.

26:37.090 --> 26:38.666
Well, he seems fine.

26:38.690 --> 26:41.606
Please. Cooped up in that
techno basement for four months?

26:41.630 --> 26:45.896
You know how much he loves pounding the
pavement, working leads, interrogating.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.716
McGee?

26:47.740 --> 26:52.170
Yeah, not to mention Gibbs,
Duckster, you and me, Abs.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.016
I mean, everyone knows
how close those two are.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.546
McGee was in the sub-basement,
Tony. They had lunch every week.

26:56.570 --> 27:00.156
It's not the same. You get used to
seeing someone every day, talking to them,

27:00.180 --> 27:02.296
relying on them, and
suddenly they're not there.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.730
- It's all part of the job.
- Excuse me.

27:05.080 --> 27:08.120
Doesn't make it any easier for McGee.

27:08.790 --> 27:11.936
As officer of the deck, I check
in thousands of sailors, sir.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.006
I don't recall encountering
Lieutenant Evans.

27:14.030 --> 27:16.876
You didn't. The man you let
on the carrier wasn't Evans.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.990
Then who was it?

27:19.700 --> 27:21.990
You tell me.

27:23.830 --> 27:29.040
Lieutenant Evans never left
Cartagena, but you signed him in.

27:29.790 --> 27:32.626
I check every sailor's
orders, every Navy I.D.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.136
Whoever I let on had the
necessary credentials.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.436
Hmm, they were stolen.

27:36.460 --> 27:39.446
I match every face to every photo.

27:39.470 --> 27:43.780
And one squid looks just
like every other squid.

27:46.060 --> 27:49.286
I've been an officer of the
deck for two years now, sir.

27:49.310 --> 27:52.446
I know how sailors talk, walk, smell.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.666
I know exactly how they
carry their damn bags.

27:54.690 --> 27:58.620
There is no way in hell I
let a civilian on this ship.

28:02.850 --> 28:03.936
Agent DiNozzo.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.330
Almeida, this is Officer David.

28:06.760 --> 28:08.716
Officer.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.276
Where's Lieutenant Kaplan?

28:10.300 --> 28:11.596
Late for his watch.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.466
He should have relieved
me at 1200 hours.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.886
You did not see the man who
logged in as Lieutenant Evans?

28:15.910 --> 28:17.326
Well, Kaplan was on duty, not me.

28:17.350 --> 28:20.640
So you do not know what station
Lieutenant Evans worked at?

28:20.670 --> 28:22.916
Uh, 3-F.

28:22.940 --> 28:26.596
The class-three I.T.s have a higher security
clearance than anyone else in the unit.

28:26.620 --> 28:29.366
You can't touch that without
a key card and pass code.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.186
Who are you calling?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.986
I'm having the card shark paged.

28:34.010 --> 28:39.110
USS Seahawk, cyclone 127
scat-hotel-fox-five-niner.

28:40.300 --> 28:41.876
2-7, USS Seahawk...

28:41.900 --> 28:44.730
What can I do for you, McGee?

28:45.710 --> 28:48.060
Well, actually...

28:48.680 --> 28:50.916
it's more what I can do for you.

28:50.940 --> 28:55.476
The Seahawk's online security system
has a mirror on the NMCI server.

28:55.500 --> 29:00.250
I'm pretty sure that
I could get into it.

29:00.740 --> 29:05.136
Security specialists on the Seahawk
are already looking for a breach.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.686
Why should I risk catching heat
from Secnav if you get caught?

29:08.710 --> 29:11.426
For one, I can do it better and faster.

29:11.450 --> 29:15.726
Two: Someone on that team of Navy security
specialists could be colluding with the killer.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.196
And the third?

29:18.220 --> 29:19.616
How'd you know there was a third?

29:19.640 --> 29:22.170
There's always a third.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.640
I won't get caught.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.916
Director, in the past four months,
I haven't worked any crime scenes,

29:31.940 --> 29:36.150
pursued any leads or followed the trail
of a single piece of physical evidence.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.816
Are you trying to talk me
into or out of this, McGee?

29:39.840 --> 29:45.106
What I have done is crack some of the toughest
encryption this side of the browser wars.

29:45.130 --> 29:48.060
You know that I can do this.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.870
Okay, understood.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.530
Yeah, as soon as I know more.

30:03.310 --> 30:05.156
Ship's crew has been verified.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.936
Everybody that's supposed
to be here is here.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.126
Looking for a ghost.

30:08.150 --> 30:10.356
Kaplan skipped his watch,
not answering pages.

30:10.380 --> 30:11.836
He was in D. C.before he joined the ship.

30:11.860 --> 30:15.070
Conveniently. He's the only one
who's seen Lieutenant Evans' killer.

30:15.350 --> 30:17.250
Claims to have seen him.

30:17.970 --> 30:20.086
You think Kaplan may be
conspiring with the killer?

30:20.110 --> 30:22.526
Or Kaplan is the killer.

30:22.550 --> 30:25.306
Kaplan could have checked on twice,
first as himself then slipped away,

30:25.330 --> 30:26.746
checked on again as Lieutenant Evans.

30:26.770 --> 30:29.840
Evans had a higher-level
security clearance than Kaplan.

30:29.870 --> 30:33.036
Which Kaplan would have needed to gain
access to secure areas of the ship.

30:33.060 --> 30:34.040
Find him.

30:34.070 --> 30:36.006
Already on it.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.420
Agent DiNozzo here
with an urgent request.

30:38.460 --> 30:41.366
This is Lieutenant Jonah Kaplan.

30:41.390 --> 30:45.476
If you have seen him or have any information as to
his whereabouts, please notify me immediately...

30:45.500 --> 30:47.306
On a loop.

30:47.330 --> 30:49.600
You got a B plan, DiNozzo?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.546
B... B plan?

30:51.570 --> 30:53.856
This is Plan B. Be prepared.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.056
B? Of course, I got a plan B.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.106
What kind of agent afloat would
I be if I didn't have a plan B?

30:58.130 --> 30:59.826
You gotta, you gotta have a plan B.

30:59.850 --> 31:02.336
I'm all about the plan B.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.476
Agent DiNozzo.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.220
Plan A; They found him.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.156
Lieutenant Kaplan?

31:10.180 --> 31:11.236
ICU.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.936
Dr. Huang is examining him now.

31:13.960 --> 31:16.646
Couple of his bunkmates found
him collapsed, rushed him in.

31:16.670 --> 31:20.230
His vital signs were weak, but
we've been able to stabilize him.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.170
- You can't...
- Criminal investigation.

31:28.020 --> 31:29.400
What's wrong?

31:30.360 --> 31:31.986
We had to induce a coma.

31:32.010 --> 31:34.506
He had brain swelling.
Lungs were collapsing.

31:34.530 --> 31:35.136
Caused by?

31:35.160 --> 31:39.516
It's too soon to say. Could be a drug
reaction. Severe bacterial infection.

31:39.540 --> 31:41.860
Could that be caused by anthrax?

31:42.340 --> 31:46.736
He would have to have been exposed to
anthrax, which is highly improbable.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.766
Well, let's say he was.

31:48.790 --> 31:50.386
How would you treat it?

31:50.410 --> 31:54.060
I'd... I'd administer Cipro.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.846
Should I be administering
Cipro, Agent Gibbs?

31:58.870 --> 32:00.206
And then what?

32:00.230 --> 32:03.756
And then I'd send my advisories and
my instructions along with his chart.

32:03.780 --> 32:05.146
He's going to be medevaced off the ship.

32:05.170 --> 32:07.476
Well, if he ever wakes up,
it'll be in Leavenworth.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.656
I don't think so.

32:08.680 --> 32:13.260
According to his file, Kaplan left D.C.
two days before Lyndi Evans was killed.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.490
Kaplan did not do it.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.900
That.

32:42.860 --> 32:46.626
I hate it when you don't know what we're looking
for, but it might kill you if you find it.

32:46.650 --> 32:48.596
Morphine.

32:48.620 --> 32:51.570
Kaplan's the only one who can
identify Lieutenant Evans' killer.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.996
And he overdoses.

32:53.020 --> 32:54.416
Hell of a cowinkidink.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.616
What's a cowinkidink?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.896
Coincidence.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.116
You believe this is a dowinkyquink?

33:01.140 --> 33:04.036
Sarcasm, Ziva. You're back
in America. Flip the switch.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.726
Technically, we are not...

33:05.750 --> 33:07.816
American ship... American soil.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.666
Oh, American soil.

33:10.690 --> 33:12.066
Enough already.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.936
You have three more
months. What's the big deal?

33:13.960 --> 33:15.516
Easy for you to say.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.046
What's that supposed to mean?

33:17.070 --> 33:19.820
You're back in D.C.
which is what you wanted.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.006
Isn't it?

33:23.030 --> 33:25.056
You get orders, Tony.

33:25.080 --> 33:27.130
You may not like them,
but you follow them.

33:27.170 --> 33:29.906
That's why they're called orders.

33:29.930 --> 33:32.096
That's not what I asked.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.346
Something happened in Israel, didn't it?

33:34.370 --> 33:38.660
You'll say you don't want to talk
about it, but your eyes won't shut up.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.726
Something you left behind maybe?

33:43.750 --> 33:45.120
Or someone?

33:45.150 --> 33:46.646
You're right.

33:46.670 --> 33:49.320
I don't want to talk about it.

33:50.030 --> 33:53.736
Doc tested Lieutenant
Kaplan. No anthrax. Just...

33:53.760 --> 33:56.276
- Morphine.
- He was drugged.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.086
Killer's tying up loose ends.

33:58.110 --> 33:59.580
Nowhere to run.

34:02.690 --> 34:03.646
Yeah. Go.

34:03.670 --> 34:08.576
Gibbs! Okay, after a whiny little temper tantrum,
Major Mass Spec finally got his act together.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.449
Scored an I.D.on the spore from
the mucus found in Lyndi Evans' 'do.

34:12.480 --> 34:13.106
And?

34:13.130 --> 34:15.036
- It's Samoan.
- A what?

34:15.060 --> 34:15.926
Samoan.

34:15.949 --> 34:19.005
Our little spore is actually
a strain of influenza.

34:19.030 --> 34:19.806
Killer had the flu.

34:19.830 --> 34:21.766
Yeah. But not just any flu, Gibbs.

34:21.790 --> 34:26.846
This strain is particular to the American
Somoan region of the South Pacific.

34:26.870 --> 34:28.560
Abby, that's good work.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.585
I don't want to hear it.

34:34.610 --> 34:37.570
Need to access the
ship's sick bay records.

34:40.070 --> 34:42.980
Uh, McGee isn't here.

34:44.770 --> 34:46.690
You.

34:50.050 --> 34:51.956
Come on.

34:51.980 --> 34:54.550
So much for better and faster.

34:55.449 --> 34:57.906
McGee, what the hell is going on?

34:57.930 --> 34:59.876
I heard Vance sent you
back to the subbasement.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.836
No. I sent myself to the subbasement.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.406
So what's next?

35:03.430 --> 35:05.556
Sending Ziva back to Israel?

35:05.580 --> 35:09.180
I can't breach the firewalls to
the Seahawk's maintenance network.

35:09.210 --> 35:10.876
Why would you do this?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.896
It's preposterous, deplorable,
absolutely illogical.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.596
Are you listening to me, McGee?

35:15.620 --> 35:18.336
Yes. It is illogical.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.726
No, no, no, no.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.326
It's logical.

35:22.350 --> 35:23.526
It's a logic bomb!

35:23.550 --> 35:25.980
Yes, Abby. It's a logic bomb.

35:29.770 --> 35:32.036
You can use a logic bomb
to infiltrate the server.

35:32.060 --> 35:34.650
Abs, that is fantastic.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.950
You're not the only
one with skills, McGee.

35:39.780 --> 35:40.986
Almost there, boss.

35:41.010 --> 35:42.916
That's what you said
ten minutes ago, DiNozzo.

35:42.940 --> 35:44.210
What is the problem, Tony?

35:44.240 --> 35:45.466
There is no problem, Ziva.

35:45.490 --> 35:47.196
I've seen McGee do this a million times.

35:47.220 --> 35:49.496
And a million times faster.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.106
McGee who?

35:51.130 --> 35:54.956
In the last week, 49 sailors
reported to sick bay with the flu.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.016
None of them joined
the ship in Cartagena.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.166
Perhaps the killer did
not report his illness.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.550
American Samoa.

36:02.330 --> 36:04.676
All sailors deployed in the past month.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.810
Okay. Personnel Deployments.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.416
Where the hell are they?

36:09.440 --> 36:10.366
Should I call McGee?

36:10.390 --> 36:15.080
Only if you want to be bored to death
by him explaining what I have just done!

36:15.570 --> 36:17.446
There. Right there.

36:17.470 --> 36:20.476
I'm trying. Just waiting
for my insult now.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.116
Takes McGee only seconds.

36:22.140 --> 36:25.070
A lot of things take
McGee seconds. Got it!

36:26.280 --> 36:28.866
Six sailors joined the
ship from American Samoa.

36:28.890 --> 36:30.966
Only three boarded in Cartagena.

36:30.990 --> 36:33.266
But only one via D.C.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.310
Sick bay.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.436
Yeah?

36:38.460 --> 36:42.120
Boss, just found a breach on the Seahawk's
Requisitions and Accounting system.

36:42.150 --> 36:46.086
There was an order placed for
100 cases of ciprofloxacin.

36:46.110 --> 36:48.316
It's worth, like, half a million bucks.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.380
But only half the order
ever made it to the Seahawk.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.980
The rest is en route to Pulau Tekong.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.026
Singapore.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.336
Most likely a black-market
distributor, boss.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.250
- Not terrorism.
- Money.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.396
Agent Gibbs?

37:03.420 --> 37:04.440
Where's Henley?

37:04.470 --> 37:05.950
He called in sick with the flu.

37:05.980 --> 37:08.096
Made sure he gave it to me first though.

37:08.120 --> 37:11.426
Ziva, Officer of the Deck. Alert
the captain. Tony, security alert.

37:11.450 --> 37:12.586
It is just the flu, isn't it?

37:12.610 --> 37:13.476
Kaplan. Where's Kaplan?

37:13.500 --> 37:15.526
He was transferred to the
flight deck 20 minutes ago.

37:15.550 --> 37:18.310
Like I said, he's
being medevaced to D.C.

37:22.530 --> 37:23.696
It's Kaplan.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.486
- Crash cart!
- Right away!

37:25.510 --> 37:26.986
He's alive.

37:27.010 --> 37:29.560
Four milligrams Alasone stat!

37:30.810 --> 37:31.866
Medevac.

37:31.890 --> 37:33.836
It's leaving right now.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.626
Hold that launch.

37:35.650 --> 37:38.420
We have to hold the medevac launch.

37:53.360 --> 37:57.926
Medevac flight 3569, change
of status. You are now holding.

37:57.950 --> 38:01.170
Copy that. Copy that.
Medevac 3569 standing by.

38:07.020 --> 38:09.050
I said hurry up!

38:09.440 --> 38:11.316
We need to launch now!

38:11.340 --> 38:13.240
I can't.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.406
Drop your weapon, Corpsman!

38:16.430 --> 38:20.336
Get off the plane or, I swear,
I will put a bullet in his head!

38:20.360 --> 38:21.766
No, you won't.

38:21.790 --> 38:24.250
He's your ride out of here.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.460
I said get off this damn plane!

38:28.310 --> 38:30.076
Hurry the hell up!

38:30.100 --> 38:31.776
Lieutenant Evans was buried in debt.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.256
You were his way out.

38:33.280 --> 38:37.306
He bought the drugs, you forged the
documents, until the wife found out.

38:37.330 --> 38:38.960
She should have stayed out of it!

38:38.990 --> 38:42.036
You killed her after he deployed.

38:42.060 --> 38:45.326
You got to him before he boarded,
you tried to talk him around it.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.836
That didn't work out well, did it?

38:47.860 --> 38:50.156
I didn't need him anyway.

38:50.180 --> 38:51.606
Just needed his I.D.

38:51.630 --> 38:55.160
You are not stopping this
plane from taking off!

38:55.920 --> 38:58.130
You want to fly?

38:59.310 --> 39:01.420
Do you want to fly?

39:02.670 --> 39:04.996
Let's fly.

39:05.020 --> 39:07.486
Not cleared, sir!

39:07.510 --> 39:11.016
Tell them Special Agent
Gibbs said, "Launch."

39:11.040 --> 39:12.856
Medevac to Flight Control.

39:12.880 --> 39:16.900
Captain, the medevac pilot's requesting
clearance on Agent Gibbs' orders.

39:16.930 --> 39:18.516
Launch the plane.

39:18.540 --> 39:20.646
I've got an armed man
aboard that aircraft.

39:20.670 --> 39:22.756
So have I, and he said launch it.

39:22.780 --> 39:25.620
Flight 3569, you are
now cleared for launch.

39:25.660 --> 39:28.190
What the hell are you waiting for?

39:29.380 --> 39:31.486
3569, acknowledge.

39:31.510 --> 39:34.590
- Go!
- Copy that. Going to positive thrust. Clear forward.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.560
Launch.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.330
Nice flight?

39:59.600 --> 40:01.766
Seems like old times.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.106
Chevy Chase, Goldie
Hawn, 1980, actually.

40:04.130 --> 40:06.206
I meant you, me and Gibbs.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.490
I know what you meant.

40:09.070 --> 40:11.810
Keep your head straight. Don't move.

40:13.510 --> 40:15.156
COD's launching in ten, boss.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.130
Well, then, grab your gear.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.646
- My gear?
- Yeah. Your collar. You ride him home.

40:19.670 --> 40:20.706
Home?

40:20.730 --> 40:23.970
- Home, DiNozzo.
- Home.

40:27.240 --> 40:31.060
Make a hole! Coming
through! Make a hole!

40:40.710 --> 40:43.536
Owens wants to know if he's
getting his Agent Afloat back.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.016
Request hit my desk today.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.316
The team needs him, Leon.

40:48.340 --> 40:51.330
I've already made my decision, Gibbs.

40:52.660 --> 40:55.810
And, in answer to your question...

40:56.180 --> 40:58.730
it was never a punishment.

41:03.290 --> 41:08.520
So this nutjob is running through the mess
hall, and he's completely naked, which is weird.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.290
Hey, boss. Talk to Vance?

41:10.690 --> 41:12.766
Yeah. Yeah. He was...

41:12.790 --> 41:16.280
Tony! You're back!

41:17.810 --> 41:19.390
In the flesh.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.276
For reals? Like, total reals? Like...

41:22.300 --> 41:24.136
"pinky promise" permanent reals?

41:24.160 --> 41:27.090
Reassigned to D.C.effective immediately.

41:28.450 --> 41:31.080
Director just told me.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.816
Never thought I'd say this, Tony,
but it is nice to have you back.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.696
Nice? It's, like, spectacular.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.416
I kept every one of your postcards, and
I have a whole DiNozzo wall in my lab.

41:41.440 --> 41:43.706
It was a long four months. I've
got to say it's great to be home.

41:43.730 --> 41:46.226
Not that I didn't think I
wouldn't be coming back because...

41:46.250 --> 41:49.516
So, anyway, Sister Rosita,
she bowled a 260 last month.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.510
And I watched Titanic finally.
It sinks at the end. Very weird.
