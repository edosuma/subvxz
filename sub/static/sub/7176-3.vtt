01:32.009 --> 01:36.304
This stranger approached me
in the marketplace.

01:38.515 --> 01:42.018
He's cut his hand badly,
and has asked for our help.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.232
Of course
we will help.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.984
Siggy, go and
fetch some hot water.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.861
Go with the servants.

01:52.404 --> 01:55.364
Helga, go and get some
strips of cloth for a bandage.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.867
Will you sit
by the fire?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.327
Thank you.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.162
You are kind.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.628
How did you do this?

02:08.712 --> 02:09.712
I don't know.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.673
I was sleeping rough,

02:13.050 --> 02:16.093
and might have caught it
on a scythe or a plowshare.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.388
What is your name?

02:20.224 --> 02:21.641
My name is Harbard.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.602
What are your names?

02:25.520 --> 02:28.814
I am Queen Aslaug,
wife of King Ragnar Lothbrok.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.816
And this is Siggy,
widow of Earl Haraldson.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.236
And this is Helga, wife of
Floki the boat builder.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.738
Oh, I've hear of King Ragnar.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.616
After all,
everyone's heard of him.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.910
He's famous everywhere.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.288
You should not be doing this,

02:44.373 --> 02:46.540
Queen Aslaug,
for I know who you are too.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.544
Daughter of Sigurd,
who killed the serpent Fafnir.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.048
Don't worry,
I am happy to do it.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.593
You said you
were sleeping rough.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.512
Why is that?

02:59.846 --> 03:02.306
I will sleep wherever
I can lay my head.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.392
I am a wanderer,

03:04.476 --> 03:06.060
and sometimes

03:06.144 --> 03:10.064
people offer me
hospitality and I sleep
on a straw bed,

03:10.148 --> 03:14.819
and sometimes
I sleep rough with
the cattle for warmth.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.823
It is all one to me.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.491
Is that true?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.160
No.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.579
No, I prefer the straw.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.836
But do not think
that I offer nothing
in return, hmm?

03:31.920 --> 03:33.462
I tell stories.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.382
Stories about
my own travels.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.675
Stories about
the gods.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.844
Or both.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.887
Hmm?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.764
As they say, I...

03:43.849 --> 03:46.142
I sing for my supper.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.771
Will you sup with us?

03:52.816 --> 03:55.651
If that is acceptable
with everyone.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.488
And to King Ragnar,
of course.

03:59.573 --> 04:02.408
Ragnar is not here.
He and the men
have gone raiding.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.411
But you are welcome
to what food we have,

04:05.495 --> 04:07.413
and to a bed of straw.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.607
You are talking
behind my back!

04:40.739 --> 04:44.283
Please do me the honor
of talking to my face.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.705
We meant no disrespect,
sire, but wondered why,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.041
if you're prepared
to share our farming
secrets with the pagans,

04:52.125 --> 04:53.709
you do not,
in return,
ask them to share

04:53.794 --> 04:56.087
their boat-building
secrets with us?

04:56.171 --> 04:59.673
And why is it,
since we give
them land to farm,

04:59.758 --> 05:02.176
we do not ask
them to convert
to the only true God?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.762
Yes, I understand
your concerns,

05:04.846 --> 05:07.056
but as things stand,
the Northmen,

05:07.140 --> 05:09.308
in the shape of
Ragnar Lothbrok,

05:09.393 --> 05:11.769
are currently
fighting beside us

05:11.853 --> 05:14.313
to help us gain
the throne of Mercia,

05:14.398 --> 05:16.482
that huge kingdom,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.651
for our puppet,
Princess Kwenthrith.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.488
Now, who among you
would choose not to turf
a few farmers off our land,

05:22.572 --> 05:24.115
rather than gain,
through this alliance,

05:24.199 --> 05:26.700
a greater part
of England itself?

05:28.745 --> 05:29.912
And besides,

05:30.747 --> 05:33.541
who knows how
this settlement
will fare in future?

05:35.252 --> 05:36.710
Speak now.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.090
Tell me I've chosen
the wrong policy.

05:42.259 --> 05:46.512
That for some reason
I am not thinking of our
kingdom and its destiny.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.181
Tell me now, if you dare,

05:49.266 --> 05:52.768
that I do not deserve
to be King of Wessex.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.998
Why are we
doing this, Ragnar?

06:14.875 --> 06:17.209
Why are we fighting
for these Christians?

06:18.420 --> 06:20.754
Doing King Ecbert's
dirty work for him.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.923
This is not
about you, Floki.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.843
It's about our children,
and their children.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.137
It is about our
people's future.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.057
And I do not want there
to be endless conflict

06:32.142 --> 06:34.643
between us and
the Christians.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.605
You're mad,
Ragnar. Deluded.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.065
There can be
no reconciliation
between our gods,

06:40.150 --> 06:42.443
the true gods,
and the God
that they worship.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.529
One or the other
must prevail.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.198
And the triumph
of the Christ-God

06:47.282 --> 06:50.242
will mean the death and
destruction of all of ours.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.579
If you don't
want to fight,

06:54.623 --> 06:56.415
then don't fight.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.375
Both of you,
save your breath.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.461
We have a mountain
to climb.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.924
Some of us will not see
a dawn like this again.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.426
Not here on Midgard,
at any rate.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.014
So let us try and
speak well of each other.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.518
And remember
how much we have
been through together.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.395
Well said, brother.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.593
Are you finished?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.061
Please.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.689
Spare my brother.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.495
Rollo! Rollo!

08:22.919 --> 08:24.545
You poor bastard.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.839
I'll see you later.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.674
If the gods allow.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.510
- They will not allow it.
- Take me with you.

08:32.721 --> 08:33.971
I must fight.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.599
You cannot fight.
You are too weak.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.934
What are you
talking about?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.152
As you can see,
you bastard,

08:48.236 --> 08:50.654
I am perfectly
able to fight.

08:51.406 --> 08:52.781
Never been better.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.541
Then what are
you waiting for?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.231
So you speak
our language now?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.900
I speak more than before.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.985
Not just because of Athelstan,

09:30.153 --> 09:31.820
but because
of these men from Wessex,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.322
who have...

09:36.117 --> 09:39.912
Helped us.
Who have helped us
with your blessing.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.664
I am gratified
and pleased.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.668
As I'm sure King Ragnar
will be pleased, also.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.755
I've brought
some of my nobles

09:49.839 --> 09:52.758
to show them the progress
you are making here.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.805
Our people,
as much as yours,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.681
will benefit from
a good harvest.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.602
And to help you prepare it,
I've brought you something.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.363
It's a new type of plow.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.666
It does not just scratch
the surface of the earth,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.752
but it digs deeper,
and because of the
angle of the blade,

10:28.837 --> 10:30.254
it turns the soil over.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.089
Now, we've made
some experiments,

10:32.173 --> 10:34.383
and when manure
is also dug into

10:34.467 --> 10:36.718
the ripped and open earth,

10:36.803 --> 10:39.054
the crop, and the
harvest, increase.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.850
You will leave
us this plow?
Yes.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.811
See how you get on.

10:56.072 --> 11:00.367
I like to experiment
between our cultures.

11:00.452 --> 11:04.288
Plowing, fertilizing,
and sowing seed

11:04.372 --> 11:06.707
are the very
basis of life.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.751
Indeed they are.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.006
Well, give this
plow to your settlers.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.757
Let them see if it works.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.092
Or not.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.013
You and Athelstan
are invited back
to my villa,

11:21.097 --> 11:22.848
whenever you
choose to come.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.350
For now,
I bid you farewell.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.943
I can't see anyone.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.077
They're up there.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.537
Wait!

12:27.497 --> 12:29.206
I will go first.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.258
Thank you.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.600
What is this?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.554
Porunn!

17:07.693 --> 17:08.944
Porunn.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.071
Porunn!

18:02.999 --> 18:05.208
Protect the Prince!
Gather round!

18:06.919 --> 18:07.919
Loose!

18:12.049 --> 18:13.258
Raise your shields!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.388
Advance!

18:34.196 --> 18:35.614
Hold your formation!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.993
Pull! Loose!

18:49.253 --> 18:50.837
It is ended!

19:41.097 --> 19:43.098
What is this place?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.100
It's a Roman bathhouse.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.274
It's beautiful.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.711
It's magnificent.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.090
Who is this woman?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.009
She's a goddess.
A Roman god.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.469
A pagan god.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.514
Like your gods,
Lagertha.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.147
She is not
like my gods.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.651
My gods

20:36.736 --> 20:38.653
are as real
as you and me.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.948
They laugh.
They bleed.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.576
They rush
around the skies.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.703
Hmm...

20:48.748 --> 20:52.834
I have been a
wanderer for most of my life.

20:54.295 --> 20:57.589
I want to tell you of the time
that I went to Utgard.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.966
You went to Utgard?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.010
Mmm. It was many years ago.

21:02.803 --> 21:07.098
I traveled east until I came
to that band of water

21:07.349 --> 21:10.477
that divides
the world of men
from Jotunheim.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.063
I rowed and rowed across

21:14.148 --> 21:16.900
until I reached
the shores of Utgard

21:17.026 --> 21:20.320
which lies between
the water and the mountains.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.530
Yes, we have all
heard of Utgard.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.616
It is where the giants live.

21:24.700 --> 21:29.412
I walked for many miles
without seeing a soul.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.831
But then, finally,

21:31.916 --> 21:34.959
I reached a huge hall.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.295
Large amounts
of giants,

21:37.379 --> 21:39.756
they were all
lounging on benches,

21:39.882 --> 21:42.383
and they sneered
when they saw me.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.640
One giant,
who I took
to be the king,

21:49.350 --> 21:52.393
he sat alone in a chair
at the end of the hall.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.395
He asked me if
I had any skill.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.148
Hmm. For he would not allow
anyone to stay with him

21:57.233 --> 22:00.318
unless he was a master
of his own craft or pastime.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.947
And what did
you tell him?

22:08.369 --> 22:10.119
I told him that
I could drink.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.413
And that I
doubted whether

22:12.498 --> 22:15.708
anyone in that hall
could drink as much as me.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.755
He asked his cup bearer
to bring his sconce-horn.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.343
He said some men there
took two draughts to empty it,

22:25.427 --> 22:29.347
but nobody was so
feeble that they couldn't
drain it in three.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.432
Did you manage?

22:31.934 --> 22:34.394
I took enormous gulps,

22:34.478 --> 22:38.273
I really did. I just...

22:38.357 --> 22:40.525
Until I was breathless.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.861
But when I finished,

22:42.945 --> 22:45.613
I saw that the
level of the drink

22:46.740 --> 22:50.410
was just
a little bit lower
than when I started.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.163
So the king,

22:54.248 --> 22:56.541
he asked me if I
wanted to try my hand

22:56.625 --> 22:58.543
at some other
type of contest.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.045
I demanded
that he let me

23:01.130 --> 23:02.881
wrestle with someone.

23:02.965 --> 23:04.340
Who did you wrestle?

23:05.050 --> 23:07.719
She was called Elli.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.430
She was his old
foster-mother.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.099
She was a horrible
old crone,

23:13.183 --> 23:15.894
who came in
hobbling with a stick.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.230
But you overcame her
pretty quickly, I should say.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.524
No, I didn't.

23:21.692 --> 23:23.359
When she threw away her stick,

23:23.444 --> 23:25.904
I hurled myself upon her!

23:25.988 --> 23:28.740
But the moment that
I laid hands on her,

23:29.617 --> 23:30.992
I realized

23:31.076 --> 23:33.578
she was strong.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.581
And she caught me in a lock
and threw me off balance.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.542
I clung to her
desperately,

23:40.252 --> 23:41.252
Can I have some more ale?

23:41.921 --> 23:44.464
This story is always
so difficult to tell.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.596
But after a struggle,
I was forced to one knee...

23:53.807 --> 23:55.016
And so I lost.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.604
Then, what
happened to you?

24:01.899 --> 24:05.026
I told the King
that he had put
me to shame.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.489
He confessed to
using spells to trick me.

24:10.324 --> 24:14.202
He said he could
scarcely believe his eyes
when I drank from the horn,

24:14.286 --> 24:17.330
because the other
end was in the sea.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.876
He said that when I
got back to the ocean,

24:21.961 --> 24:25.338
that I would see
how much it had ebbed
with my efforts.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.759
And his old
foster-mother?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.469
He said it was a marvel

24:32.012 --> 24:34.305
that I had withstood
her for so long,

24:34.807 --> 24:36.391
because Elli

24:36.475 --> 24:38.059
is old age.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.480
And even if life
is not cut short

24:42.564 --> 24:44.399
by the sword or by illness,

24:45.150 --> 24:48.528
no one can
withstand old age

24:49.405 --> 24:50.780
in the end.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.370
Well, it seems to me,

24:59.289 --> 25:01.582
it was not you
in the Great Hall.

25:03.544 --> 25:05.294
Then who was I?

25:08.382 --> 25:10.133
You were
the God Thor.

25:10.592 --> 25:13.928
Only Thor
can drain the seas
and fight old age.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.557
You're right.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.767
I was Thor.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.769
The thunder god!

25:25.941 --> 25:29.110
But even so,
I was still there.

25:29.194 --> 25:32.947
And I saw it all
with my own eyes.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.413
Who is that?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.582
No one.
He is your son.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.836
He needs to see me.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.053
Hush, Ivar.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.555
It's all right.

25:57.639 --> 25:58.931
Queen Aslaug...

26:09.068 --> 26:10.735
Listen to me, Ivar.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.281
All the pain is
going away, Ivar.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.658
All the pain
is going away.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.328
I am taking your pain.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.039
Hush, good boy.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.708
There is
no more pain.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.879
No more pain,
it's all going away.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.174
Now you're getting
very sleepy, Ivar.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.010
Go to sleep.

26:36.512 --> 26:37.929
That's a good boy.

26:38.472 --> 26:41.015
Go to sleep.
Good boy.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.184
Good boy.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.192
How did you do that?

27:00.410 --> 27:02.703
Is this really a bath?

27:05.916 --> 27:07.333
It is very big.

27:07.793 --> 27:11.462
The Romans used their baths
not just to get clean,

27:11.547 --> 27:13.256
but for pleasure.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.717
The would spend time
with each other in such baths

27:16.802 --> 27:19.637
talking about
their lives, politics,

27:20.514 --> 27:22.014
who was sleeping with who.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.103
So...

27:28.856 --> 27:30.481
Who will join me?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.698
Let us
talk about the Romans.

27:39.074 --> 27:43.119
Most of what they built here
now lies in ruins,

27:43.203 --> 27:44.829
but there is
another place.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.165
A great city,
which the Romans built,

27:47.249 --> 27:49.625
and it still
stands to this day.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.419
It is a city called

27:51.920 --> 27:53.045
Paris.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.923
In a land called Frankia.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.427
I visited there with
the emperor Charlemagne.

28:00.721 --> 28:01.721
Lagertha,

28:02.556 --> 28:05.224
you will never in your life

28:05.309 --> 28:09.020
see such a place, such a city.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.189
Tell her, Athelstan.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.441
It is true.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.860
I've once visited
Paris myself.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.529
It is set upon an island

28:18.614 --> 28:21.449
in the middle of a
great river called
the Seine.

28:22.201 --> 28:26.871
It has high walls
and ramparts all
around it, for many miles.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.666
I remember when I saw
it for the first time.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.085
It was like a dream,

28:33.170 --> 28:34.629
as if it were not real.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.339
A vision.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.219
How far
is this city?

28:41.970 --> 28:45.389
It lies on the other side
of a narrow stretch of water.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.392
Many here trade
with the Franks,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.062
and we still
drink their wine.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.404
What is it?

29:02.407 --> 29:03.741
This is wrong.

29:08.330 --> 29:09.622
It's wrong.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.448
I'm sorry.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.575
What for?

29:47.619 --> 29:48.953
You didn't do anything.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.621
And nothing
happened.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.709
That's the point.

29:58.714 --> 30:00.923
I wanted something
to happen.

30:01.550 --> 30:04.051
I wanted something
to happen between
you and me.

30:04.553 --> 30:05.678
Right there
in the water.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.471
In front of them.
I didn't care.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.932
It was wrong of me.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.101
I'm married.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.270
I have a child.

30:14.354 --> 30:15.563
I'm a Christian.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.191
Nothing happened
and you've done no wrong.

30:19.901 --> 30:23.029
And the Lord understands
our weaknesses and our trials.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.285
I am tired,
Athelstan.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.831
I'm so tired.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.421
Then go and sleep.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.426
And may the Lord,
in his mercy,
bless you and keep you,

30:46.178 --> 30:47.428
Judith.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.016
Blessed Judith.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.826
This is your
fault, Ragnar.

31:55.497 --> 31:58.999
Torstein has died
fighting for a hill
he did not want to own.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.628
For something which meant
nothing to him.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.131
He has died a
pointless death.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.180
How many more of us must die
for your Christians?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.475
Or have you,

32:16.560 --> 32:18.435
in your heart,

32:18.520 --> 32:21.772
already renounced our gods
and turned to the Christ-God?

32:22.983 --> 32:26.193
Is that what your friend
Athelstan has persuaded
you to do?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.196
But look.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.491
Here we are.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.326
Under an English sky.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.371
Burying our dead.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.624
Those we have sacrificed
for Jesus Christ.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.716
We are all fated to die
on a certain day, yes?

32:50.927 --> 32:52.887
But it is our
own choice

32:52.971 --> 32:55.681
to do as we please
until that day comes.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.143
I did not
force Torstein,

32:59.227 --> 33:01.896
or any of you,
to come for that matter.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.316
You all chose
to be here.

33:08.904 --> 33:12.114
My heart is as heavy
for Torstein as anyone's,

33:13.450 --> 33:16.744
but I am sure that I will
bump into him again soon.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.247
And in the
meantime, Floki,

33:20.332 --> 33:21.832
shut your face.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.003
Ragnar,

33:26.087 --> 33:28.213
you had better come
and see your son.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.830
Is she still alive?

34:02.791 --> 34:03.916
Yes.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.962
But her face...

34:21.393 --> 34:22.810
It is my fault.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.270
I didn't protect her.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.315
That is what
her shield is for.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.276
We fight.

34:31.361 --> 34:34.446
That is how we win
and that is how we die.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.533
Do you understand?

34:38.243 --> 34:39.994
But she is with child!

34:52.590 --> 34:54.341
And you let her come?

34:55.176 --> 34:56.176
Hmm?

34:57.929 --> 35:00.014
She will probably die,

35:01.808 --> 35:03.767
with your child
in her belly,

35:03.852 --> 35:05.936
and it will be
your fault,

35:06.021 --> 35:07.604
because you have
the strength of a man,

35:07.689 --> 35:10.024
but the will
of a little girl.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.110
I can't believe
you're my son.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.824
I can't even
look at you!

35:29.794 --> 35:31.670
I do not think
she will die.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.010
She wants to live.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.556
She has a lot
to live for.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.353
But if she hears you
weeping and lamenting,

35:48.438 --> 35:50.230
she will choose to die.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.359
Be strong.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.279
Be a man.

35:57.363 --> 35:59.740
Coax her back
from Valhalla.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.913
But make it
worth her while,

36:07.874 --> 36:09.958
for she is already
at the gates.

36:12.796 --> 36:14.421
You don't have
to worry about it.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.256
Ah, Ragnar.
My ally.

36:16.633 --> 36:18.759
Burgred has something
to say to you.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.012
I did not mean to
fight against you today.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.348
I am young.
I was led by
evil counselors.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.934
I beg your
forgiveness,
King Ragnar.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.360
I forgive you.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.535
Get up, get up.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.078
Let me see.

36:50.458 --> 36:51.834
Come on.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.269
We bring you good news.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.230
Our armies have
defeated the Mercians.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.652
Thank God my son,
Aethelwulf, is alive.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.239
And also King Ragnar.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.074
And your son.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.410
Then we, too,
thank the gods.

37:27.453 --> 37:30.455
You must stay.
We are ready to
sow the first crop.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.669
And sacrifice to Freyr
to ensure its success.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.505
We should stay.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.466
And take part.

37:42.010 --> 37:45.220
I agree. We will
stay for the sacrifice.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.931
My lord!
I said we will stay.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.150
Help!

37:58.443 --> 37:59.443
Help me!

38:02.697 --> 38:04.072
Help me!

38:04.157 --> 38:05.407
Help!

38:05.867 --> 38:07.075
Help!

38:09.329 --> 38:10.329
Look!

38:10.955 --> 38:12.456
Look what I caught!

38:13.750 --> 38:14.875
Look!

38:14.959 --> 38:17.169
Look, by all the gods,

38:17.253 --> 38:19.755
look what I
caught in my nets.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.651
Thorolf!

38:42.278 --> 38:45.405
My son!
My poor son!

38:48.034 --> 38:49.034
Raud!

38:52.247 --> 38:55.958
They must
have drowned, for I can find
no marks on their bodies.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.253
How is this possible?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.296
So far out to sea.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.839
All I know is,

39:02.924 --> 39:04.549
my nets were
suddenly heavy,

39:04.634 --> 39:06.426
like I'd
caught a whale.

43:14.717 --> 43:16.718
My lord,
this is sacrilege.

43:16.802 --> 43:20.138
Unless they renounce
their false gods
and heathen ways,

43:20.223 --> 43:23.016
we should not allow them
to stay any longer.

43:45.539 --> 43:47.374
What is it you want?

43:48.084 --> 43:50.502
A stranger has
come to Kattegat.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.295
His name
is Harbard.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.382
It is possible
that he is

43:56.092 --> 43:59.386
a magician, or...
He has powers
of some kind.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.263
Why do you
think that?

44:02.890 --> 44:06.184
Before he arrived,
I dreamt of him.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.019
And so did
two other women.

44:08.104 --> 44:09.562
All of us,
the same dream.

44:13.401 --> 44:16.569
Queen Aslaug cannot
comfort her son Ivar
when he is suffering.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.196
But this man, he...

44:19.407 --> 44:21.157
He takes away
Ivar's pain,

44:21.242 --> 44:23.118
and the boy goes
back to sleep.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.746
If he possesses powers,

44:27.290 --> 44:29.582
then he is putting
them to good use.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.419
But are you sure?

44:35.006 --> 44:36.840
Two young boys
died today.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.009
A fisherman caught
them in his nets.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.593
Yes, I know.

44:41.387 --> 44:44.139
Might he not be connected
to the deaths of these boys?

44:44.223 --> 44:45.598
Why should he be?

44:47.476 --> 44:48.685
I don't know.

44:50.146 --> 44:51.771
But you would know.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.608
What have the
gods told you?

44:56.152 --> 44:57.527
What have
you foreseen?

44:58.738 --> 45:01.948
The gods have
vouchsafed me nothing,
told me nothing.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.868
They have neither
warned me,

45:04.952 --> 45:06.703
nor promised
me anything.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.291
And I have
foreseen nothing.

45:11.792 --> 45:13.793
But we have
foreseen something.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.673
We women, we dreamt
that you were...

45:19.550 --> 45:21.176
You were tied up,
that you were bleeding,

45:21.260 --> 45:24.471
and you could neither
move nor cry out.

45:26.348 --> 45:27.974
That is what we saw.

45:29.435 --> 45:30.935
We saw that

45:32.938 --> 45:34.647
nobody could help us.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.569
It's true.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.655
No one can help you.
