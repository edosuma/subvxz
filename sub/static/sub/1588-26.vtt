(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:18.520 --> 00:22.756
You know what I'm thinking?
Pizza night!
Yeah! With extra meat!

00:22.823 --> 00:25.659
So what do you say?

00:25.726 --> 00:29.030
Pizza and a movie?
Now you're talking.

00:29.096 --> 00:34.096
I love <i>Who Cut The Cheese.
It's my favorite whodunit</i>

00:34.769 --> 00:39.769
And now my favorite part
is when the guy says,
"Ew, who cut the cheese?"

00:40.073 --> 00:41.375
(LAUGHS)

00:41.441 --> 00:42.942
(CRASHING)

00:43.009 --> 00:44.378
(MEOWS)

00:44.444 --> 00:48.344
Looking for us, kitty boy?

00:49.616 --> 00:50.951
(CLATTERING)

00:51.018 --> 00:52.953
Wait till you see
what I'm working on.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.656
Tonight
at the Singles Science Mixer

00:55.723 --> 00:57.492
I'll be practicing
the law of attraction,

00:57.559 --> 01:01.628
rather than my usual
law of repulsion. (CHUCKLES)

01:01.695 --> 01:02.763
Ah.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.666
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

01:04.733 --> 01:08.236
Doc has got to work
on his material. No wonder
he can't get a date.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.171
I've also brought
a special surprise for you.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.305
Come on...

01:12.372 --> 01:13.941
Fuzzy slippers.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.944
As you may know
it's Bring Your Child
To Work Day.

01:16.011 --> 01:20.080
And since, well, I don't have
a child I brought
the next best thing.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.682
Meet Medusa.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.550
(HISSING)

01:23.617 --> 01:26.987
Oh, don't worry, boys.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.757
Medusa wouldn't harm a fly.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.592
(SCREAMS)

01:31.658 --> 01:34.294
Anything bigger than a fly.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.864
(SCREAMS)

01:36.931 --> 01:39.733
(CLEARS THROAT) Yes,
well, that's Medusa.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.804
She gets anxious
in new social situations.

01:42.871 --> 01:47.208
Medusa gets anxious?
Ha! My life passed
before my eyes.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.544
And it was not
as good as I rember.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.945
Now where was I?

01:52.011 --> 01:52.813
Oh, yes.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.748
The Singles Science Mixer.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.550
No cheese platter tonight.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.219
I'm bringing
my latest invention,

01:58.286 --> 02:03.286
a love potion
delivered in party bubbles.

02:03.391 --> 02:07.261
Everyone loves party bubbles,
right?

02:07.328 --> 02:11.399
And if the potion
actually works
everyone will love me.

02:11.466 --> 02:16.466
Well, more specifically,
Dr. Pamela Widdington.

02:17.906 --> 02:22.906
If I can get these protozoa
to fall in love
on a cellular level

02:23.745 --> 02:27.848
then I might actually
stand a chance
at that mixer tonight.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.517
(SCREAMS)

02:30.584 --> 02:33.354
Nuts! Something's wrong.

02:33.421 --> 02:37.592
Love is a delicate balance
of different emotions
all swirled into one.

02:37.659 --> 02:41.596
Two drops glee,
one drop nervousness,
half a drop of fear...

02:41.663 --> 02:45.398
There...
That should do the trick.
I think.

02:45.465 --> 02:49.937
(BLOWS)

02:50.004 --> 02:52.540
Better. But still
no love connection.

02:52.607 --> 02:56.678
(SIGHS) Well,
just another night
of one-sided conversations,

02:56.744 --> 03:00.648
missed opportunities,
and computer chess,
I guess.

03:00.715 --> 03:04.818
Sure, no problem.
Ask the rodents to take care
of the killer snake.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.186
Makes total sense.

03:06.252 --> 03:07.602
(SNORING)

03:15.029 --> 03:17.664
Hey, I know,
why don't we feed Medusa, too?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.467
I'm not using this leg.
Here you go.

03:19.534 --> 03:24.534
Still hungry, Medusa?
Have my head.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.012
The love connection.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.916
The doc's potion
actually works.
I mean it really works.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.986
Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

03:38.053 --> 03:43.053
If Medusa comes after us,
we'll just hit her with one
of these love bubbles.

03:49.597 --> 03:54.597
Isn't it romantic?
Someone's going
to fall in love?

04:00.440 --> 04:01.441
(PANTING)

04:01.508 --> 04:03.908
(LOUD HEARTBEAT)

04:09.650 --> 04:13.100
Oh, my eyes!
They burn!

04:21.562 --> 04:26.562
Uh, Jer, you're kind of
embarrassing yourself.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.770
(CLATTERING)

04:29.837 --> 04:33.174

04:33.240 --> 04:38.240
Hey, Jer, snap out of it,
It's Napoleon here.

04:42.917 --> 04:47.917
Hey, you big bully,
why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

04:48.889 --> 04:51.225
(SCREECHES TO A HALT)

04:51.292 --> 04:54.729
Well, if you haven't noticed,
I'm not your own size.

04:54.796 --> 04:58.999
How can you read
at a moment like this?
Jerry's in trouble!

04:59.066 --> 05:00.568
(MUMBLING)

05:00.635 --> 05:05.635
Yes, I know
it's an emergency,
I can see that.

05:24.692 --> 05:29.692
This happened
last time
I listened to you.

05:31.599 --> 05:36.103
Of course! Make Tom
fall in love with Jerry!
You're right.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.239
Okay. Okay.
I can remember this.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.475
Think now. It was
four drops glee,

05:41.542 --> 05:46.542
maybe a drop of nervousness,
and a little bit of fear.

05:48.949 --> 05:53.749
Oh, come on.
Give a rat a break.
