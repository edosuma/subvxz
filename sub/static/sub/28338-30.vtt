00:02.290 --> 00:05.080
[snoring]

00:09.620 --> 00:10.920
[snoring]

00:10.920 --> 00:12.710
[whispering]
Marco. Wake up.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.120
[sniffs, sighs]

00:14.120 --> 00:16.040
No.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.790
[whispering]
I know the solution
to getting back to Mewni.

00:18.790 --> 00:20.750
It's Janna!

00:20.750 --> 00:23.290
Janna? [groans]

00:23.290 --> 00:27.040
Let's not talk
about Janna until I've
had my morning tea.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.580
-[thud]
-Ow! Oww!

00:29.580 --> 00:31.290
-Don't you remember? Huh!
-Oh!

00:31.290 --> 00:35.330
Janna mysteriously showed up
on Mewni without a portal.

00:35.330 --> 00:37.170
Oh, yeah!

00:37.170 --> 00:39.040
We gotta wake up Tom.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.880
-Tom, wake up!
-[snoring]

00:40.880 --> 00:42.210
Tom?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.790
Oh. Look up.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.120
Ugh!

00:46.040 --> 00:47.670
[female voice]
Calling Janna.

00:47.670 --> 00:49.040
C'mon, Janna.
Pick up your phone.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.580
-[ringing]
-Pick up, pick up, pick up!

00:50.580 --> 00:52.790
Aw, she'll never pick up.

00:52.790 --> 00:54.710
She's probably someplace
super weird.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.790
Like a monster truck
graveyard.

00:56.790 --> 00:57.880
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
[Janna] Hello?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.250
Oh, thank goodness, Janna!

01:00.250 --> 01:02.040
Okay! Okay, listen to me
very carefully!

01:02.040 --> 01:04.500
We are stuck on Earth.
The portals aren't working.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.040
You gotta tell me,
how did you get to Mewni?

01:08.040 --> 01:10.420
Yeah! We gotta get back,
like, now!

01:10.420 --> 01:12.210
Something really bad is
happening!

01:12.210 --> 01:14.420
[Janna]
Wait, can you say that louder?

01:14.420 --> 01:16.620
[grunting]

01:16.620 --> 01:19.210
Yeah, the reception here
is pretty bad.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.670
I'm at a monster truck
graveyard.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.250
Listen to me carefully!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.170
[deep breath]

01:24.170 --> 01:29.210
How. Did. You. Get. To. Mewni?

01:29.210 --> 01:30.250
I don't know. Bye.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.830
No, no, Janna, wait! Ugh!

01:31.830 --> 01:33.250
Arrrgh! Janna!

01:33.250 --> 01:34.920
Now what?

01:34.920 --> 01:38.170
We gotta wait
for the beast in her cave.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.170
[clock ticking]

01:40.170 --> 01:43.620
It's so nice to finally meet
our Janna's friends.

01:43.620 --> 01:46.620
And each as unique
as her it seems.

01:46.620 --> 01:50.710
So did you meet
before the Canada trip?

01:50.710 --> 01:52.040
What's a Canada?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.460
Oh!
Did I pronounce it wrong?

01:54.460 --> 01:57.290
Tala and I have never been,
so, you know.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.830
Janna says it's lovely.

02:00.460 --> 02:01.920
[sip]

02:04.040 --> 02:05.210
[sip]

02:06.920 --> 02:08.920
-[sip]
-Are any of you dating?

02:08.920 --> 02:10.250
[chokes, coughing]

02:10.250 --> 02:11.380
[door opens and closes]

02:11.380 --> 02:13.000
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.120
Hi, sweetie!

02:14.120 --> 02:15.210
[all] Janna!

02:15.210 --> 02:17.120
Oh, geez.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.500
N-nice-- Nice meeting you,
Mr. and Mrs. Janna!

02:21.330 --> 02:24.250
I hear Vancouver's nice.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.920
[all] Janna!

02:25.920 --> 02:29.620
I thought you kids respected
others' personal space.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.250
Welcome to my room, I guess.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.290
Wow, sweet digs.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.750
It's nicely creepy.

02:36.750 --> 02:40.040
Soo, how's the breakup going?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.750
What? That just happened!

02:41.750 --> 02:43.250
How did you even know that?

02:43.250 --> 02:45.170
Oh, I hid a camera
on Marco's body.

02:45.170 --> 02:46.330
What?!

02:46.330 --> 02:49.710
Tom! Help me find
this illegal surveillance!

02:49.710 --> 02:51.620
No, no, dude,
I don't wanna get bugged!

02:51.620 --> 02:54.380
Guys! We can't get
distracted by her...

02:54.380 --> 02:55.790
Jannanigans.

02:57.330 --> 02:58.790
Janna Banana,

02:58.790 --> 03:01.960
you know the seriousness
of this situation.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.380
And you know
you're our last hope.

03:04.380 --> 03:08.330
So, please,
how did you get to Mewni?

03:08.330 --> 03:09.960
I don't remember.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.210
Aaahhhhhh!

03:11.210 --> 03:13.380
No, really. Look.

03:13.380 --> 03:17.170
All I remember
from that day is
that it was a Thursday.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.420
A totally normal Thursday.

03:19.420 --> 03:21.670
All right.
I'm scared to ask.

03:21.670 --> 03:26.540
But what is a "normal"
Thursday like for Janna?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.540
Thursday is garbage day.

03:30.540 --> 03:34.330
So you bring your garbage
to your neighbor's garage?

03:34.330 --> 03:35.290
To feed the possums.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.000
[both screaming]

03:39.000 --> 03:41.290
You're not supposed
to feed these things!

03:41.290 --> 03:42.460
If I don't,
they'll come to my garage.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.250
No! No! That's my leg!

03:44.250 --> 03:46.250
-So what happened next?
-[Tom and Marco screaming]

03:46.250 --> 03:47.420
Well,
usually these rascals

03:47.420 --> 03:49.210
-tear up my hat.
-[shredding]

03:49.210 --> 03:51.420
And then I have to go get
a new one from Needles.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.250
Who's Needles?

03:53.250 --> 03:55.460
He's the man
who runs these streets.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.670
Whoa, whoa, Janna!

03:57.670 --> 04:00.210
You know the boss
isn't happy with you.

04:00.210 --> 04:02.250
He who gives
shall never need.

04:02.250 --> 04:05.210
He who takes
shall forever bleed.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.790
It ain't my fault
if you leave here in crutches.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.210
Come on.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.750
I don't like the sound
of this Needles.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.500
-Hey! Quiet in the back!
-Show some respect.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.880
Janna! What's up!

04:18.880 --> 04:20.290
Hey, Needles.

04:20.290 --> 04:21.580
Looks like
you need a new hat.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.330
Looks right.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.790
But you still owe me
for the last one I made you.

04:24.790 --> 04:26.620
Don't forget,
you're in the red.

04:26.620 --> 04:29.080
Oh, dang.
I never got you the goods.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.250
Yeah, that's right.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.750
And you know
what that means.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.420
Omega One doesn't have
any tennis balls!

04:34.420 --> 04:35.420
Tennis balls?

04:35.420 --> 04:37.420
Yeah. Needles knits my hats

04:37.420 --> 04:39.290
that I pay for
with tennis balls.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.250
Standard back alley deal.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.290
Yeah, standard
back alley deal!

04:42.290 --> 04:43.750
You know what it is.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.290
A normal thing.
That's how we do it.

04:45.290 --> 04:46.290
We don't have time
for this!

04:46.290 --> 04:47.670
We gotta get to Mewni!

04:47.670 --> 04:49.380
Well, guess what?
You better make some time.

04:49.380 --> 04:50.830
Or Bland Man over here

04:50.830 --> 04:52.420
is gonna get broke
like a breadstick! Crack!

04:52.420 --> 04:54.250
What? Who? Me?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.920
Or maybe we can make
a deal for these sweet horns!

04:56.920 --> 04:58.920
I could make a real nice hat
with those.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.420
-Hand 'em over!
-Hey!

05:00.420 --> 05:04.080
Cool it, Needles. My crew and I
will get you the goods.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.620
Oooh,
that's a fresh one.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.500
Just about
a hundred more to go!

05:09.500 --> 05:13.880
Man. A week ago,
I was staring
at a thousand sunsets

05:13.880 --> 05:16.290
in the dimension
with a thousand sunsets.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.460
And now I'm here
picking up tennis balls.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.170
Yeah, sorry
it ended like this.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.420
It's cool.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.460
And you know what?
We're cool.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.830
Wait, were we not?

05:26.830 --> 05:29.670
Well, with Star and I
broken up now,

05:29.670 --> 05:32.080
just saying,
it's cool if...

05:32.080 --> 05:33.790
If what?

05:33.790 --> 05:38.540
I mean, if you
and your best friend

05:38.540 --> 05:41.540
ended up being something else,

05:41.540 --> 05:42.920
I wouldn't be mad.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.420
What? Tom!

05:44.420 --> 05:46.040
The Blood Moon Curse
has been lifted.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.960
I mean, you were there.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.500
Come on, dude.
I think we both know
that what you two have

05:52.500 --> 05:55.120
is something better
than a curse.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.330
-Guys!
-Aah!

05:56.330 --> 05:58.540
I think we gotta...
What are you staring at?

05:58.540 --> 06:00.380
Uh.
[mumbles gibberish]

06:00.380 --> 06:02.120
I think we gotta
put some pressure on her.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.920
This is
getting ridiculous.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.120
Janna! How can you
not be taking this seriously?!

06:07.120 --> 06:08.710
Mewni might be
in trouble!

06:08.710 --> 06:10.580
You're wasting so much time!

06:10.580 --> 06:14.540
Well, excuse me, Bland Man!
Geez!

06:14.540 --> 06:16.540
Hey! That's not my name!

06:16.540 --> 06:18.790
What part of
"I don't remember
how I got to Mewni"

06:18.790 --> 06:20.790
do you guys
not understand?

06:20.790 --> 06:23.380
You guys just
do not get it!

06:23.380 --> 06:26.210
I am the author
of my own weirdness!

06:26.210 --> 06:27.960
But forgetting
how I got to Mewni

06:27.960 --> 06:29.540
was totally out of my control,

06:29.540 --> 06:30.790
and it freaks me out!

06:30.790 --> 06:31.830
[sighs]

06:33.540 --> 06:34.920
Aw, Janna...

06:34.920 --> 06:36.960
I'm sorry I can't
help you guys out,

06:36.960 --> 06:39.210
I really am.
I just cannot remember

06:39.210 --> 06:41.380
what happened that day
for the life of me.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.960
Janna, I'm...
I didn't realize

06:42.960 --> 06:45.170
how much all of this
was affecting you.

06:45.170 --> 06:49.880
Plus, I didn't realize
that you actually
had human emotions.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.000
Yeah. Me, neither.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.500
C'mon. Let's--
Let's just take a break.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.000
Well, collecting tennis balls
does make me hungry.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.920
[peppy instrumental
music playing]

07:03.620 --> 07:06.620
Okay, party people,
I got your grub.

07:06.620 --> 07:09.500
Taco-o-o-o for Mango-o-o-o!

07:09.500 --> 07:10.790
Ha ha, all right.

07:10.790 --> 07:14.000
And for the lady...
wait a second!

07:14.000 --> 07:16.830
Your name wouldn't happen
to be Janna, would it?

07:16.830 --> 07:18.880
No. It's Banana.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.460
Okay. Cool.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.460
All I know is I'm supposed
to refuse service

07:22.460 --> 07:24.170
to someone named Janna.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.460
Can't be too careful!

07:25.460 --> 07:28.000
I know, right?
Dangerous world!

07:28.000 --> 07:32.040
But, as they say,
"Enjoy your horchata."

07:32.040 --> 07:33.170
[sipping]

07:39.290 --> 07:42.080
So you just havin'
horchata today, huh, Star?

07:42.080 --> 07:43.790
I'm just too stressed
to eat right now.

07:43.790 --> 07:46.500
I mean, we have no idea
what's happening on Mewni.

07:48.710 --> 07:51.290
Why do you have
to put hot sauce
on every bite?

07:51.290 --> 07:53.710
Why don't you just put it
on the whole taco
all at once?

07:57.960 --> 08:01.830
Whoo! Habanero sauce
makes me sweat
like a beast!

08:01.830 --> 08:04.120
Pfft!
Hey! That's my shirt!

08:04.120 --> 08:06.040
What are you
talking about?

08:06.040 --> 08:08.500
This is the 200 taco punch card
Mystery Prize!

08:08.500 --> 08:10.080
And it's mine!

08:10.080 --> 08:11.750
Just look at it!

08:11.750 --> 08:13.080
See?!

08:13.080 --> 08:16.170
[gasp] Guys! I remember.

08:16.170 --> 08:18.170
You remember
stealing my shirt?!

08:18.170 --> 08:19.580
No! Shh, shh, shh!
Marco!

08:19.580 --> 08:21.210
You'll break her train
of thought!

08:21.210 --> 08:23.120
After I collected
the tennis balls,

08:23.120 --> 08:25.380
I stopped by here
on my way back to Needles

08:25.380 --> 08:27.460
and saw a promo
for the 200 taco Mystery Prize.

08:27.460 --> 08:28.960
And I figured,
"Hey, this girl has eaten

08:28.960 --> 08:31.710
at least 200 tacos over
the course of her lifetime,"

08:31.710 --> 08:33.830
so they already owed me
the prize.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.710
But they didn't see it that way.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.500
So I claimed what was mine.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.290
I went
to the back door and...

08:40.290 --> 08:43.080
Omph! Omph! Omph!

08:43.080 --> 08:45.330
Hello? Huhhh!

08:47.040 --> 08:49.710
Okay, at Britta's,
they always keep
the Mystery Prize

08:49.710 --> 08:53.460
in the supply closet,
so I forced open the door.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.000
Yup! Sure enough! Forced entry!

08:57.290 --> 08:59.790
And this is
where it gets weird!

08:59.790 --> 09:01.290
I went down
this creepy ladder.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.710
[Tom and Marco groan]

09:02.710 --> 09:05.670
Yeah, I think they age
their meat down here.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.880
Oh, yeah, this
is looking familiar.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.880
Are those dinosaur bones?

09:19.540 --> 09:21.540
Where I got my new shirt!

09:21.540 --> 09:24.670
And then I guess I saw
this dumb wall with graffiti.

09:27.790 --> 09:30.500
Whoaa!

09:32.040 --> 09:34.120
[Marco] I don't think
that's graffiti.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.420
Glossaryck?

09:37.420 --> 09:38.750
Janna, what happened next?

Are you okay?

09:51.460 --> 09:55.790
Yeah. I just, uh, fell
into some secret sauce.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.620
Uh, I don't think
that's secret sauce.

10:02.290 --> 10:03.620
[gasp]

10:03.620 --> 10:04.710
