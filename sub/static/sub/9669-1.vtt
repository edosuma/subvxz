03:19.700 --> 03:22.952
Excuse me, miss.
There seems to be a mistake.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.788
I ordered the large cappuccino.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.957
Hello!

03:28.292 --> 03:31.210
-Look at the size of this.
-It's a bowl.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.796
It's like Campbell's cup-o-ccino.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.841
My sides. Please.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.972
So Tony...

03:43.932 --> 03:45.808
...what's with your clothes?

03:46.518 --> 03:48.102
What?

03:48.353 --> 03:51.230
You Iook like you're in
Starsky and Hutch.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.066
-I look hip.
-No, no, no.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.069
More like an undercover cop
trying to be.

03:57.821 --> 04:01.616
-I am a cop trying to look hip.
-Can you do me a favour?

04:01.867 --> 04:05.995
When you go to my parents'
don't dress like a 1 970s pimp.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.040
My parents are a little eccentric.

04:09.750 --> 04:14.420
This poem is called, "An Apology
To The Aliens Who Abducted Me...

04:14.671 --> 04:17.130
...and Whom I Inflicted
Destruction Upon...

04:17.341 --> 04:20.301
...While Having a Panic Attack
Aboard the Ship."

04:20.510 --> 04:22.386
Autobiographical.

04:25.057 --> 04:28.225
-What are you gonna do tonight?
-Well...

04:28.810 --> 04:31.562
...l'm gonna do a poem about Sherri.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.067
The "Woman, Woe Man,
Whoa Man" poem.

04:36.234 --> 04:37.401
Yeah.

04:39.154 --> 04:43.324
Tell me again.
Why did you break up with Sherri?

04:43.575 --> 04:46.410
Tony, I told you aIready,
she's a thief.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.373
-You don't honestIy believe that?
-Tony, she's a klepto.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.293
To this day I still don't know
where my cat is.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.339
Charlie, every time
you meet a nice girl...

04:58.590 --> 05:02.009
-...you get paranoid and break up.
-That's not true.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.804
-I broke up for good reasons.
-Really?

05:05.055 --> 05:07.640
-Yes.
-What about Jill?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.059
She was in the Mafia.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.647
-She was in the Mafia?
-Yes, the Cosa Nostra.

05:14.898 --> 05:19.110
-I never knew how she made a living.
-She was unempIoyed.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.279
-She didn't work.
-That's a perfect cover.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.950
All right. What about Pam?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.997
She smeIled like soup.

05:33.709 --> 05:37.128
-What does that mean?
-Like beef-vegetable soup.

05:37.379 --> 05:39.547
-Paranoid.
-You weren't there.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.424
-It's all in your head.
-No, no.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.092
-It is.
-No, no.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.682
-I'm up. Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

05:55.439 --> 06:00.860
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for our own Mr. Charlie MacKenzie.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.959
Woman

06:17.210 --> 06:18.794
Woe man

06:19.004 --> 06:21.672
Whoa man

06:22.424 --> 06:25.634
She was a thief
You gotta believe

06:25.844 --> 06:28.971
She stole my heart and my cat

06:29.806 --> 06:31.265
Betty

06:31.641 --> 06:32.975
Judy

06:33.185 --> 06:36.520
Josie and those hot Pussycats

06:36.730 --> 06:40.232
They make me horny
Saturday morny

06:40.484 --> 06:43.861
Girls of cartoons
Won't leave me in ruins

06:44.071 --> 06:47.114
I want to be Betty's Barney

06:47.616 --> 06:51.869
Hey, Jane, get me off
This crazy thing

06:52.412 --> 06:54.622
Called love

07:54.891 --> 07:57.393
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.061
Can l help you?

07:59.604 --> 08:05.025
-Yes, do you have haggis?
-Yes, we do. One?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.819
Yes, please.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.280
My parents are Scottish.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.871
That will be $1 9.75.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.332
Here you go.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.669
Thank you.

08:24.963 --> 08:28.174
-Will there be anything else?
-No, thanks.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.260
Thanks.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.136
May, get in here!

09:34.991 --> 09:38.327
All right, May, turn off
the Bay City Rollers!

09:38.620 --> 09:41.247
The soccer game's about to begin!

09:47.504 --> 09:50.005
-HeIlo.
-Hi!

09:52.008 --> 09:53.759
We're in here, son!

09:54.010 --> 09:56.220
-Charlie.
-How's it going, William?

09:56.429 --> 10:00.182
Give your mother a kiss,
or l'Il kick your teeth in.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.309
Hi. Hey!

10:06.523 --> 10:08.524
May. Shut it!

10:10.443 --> 10:12.403
-How you doing, Dad?
-Fine.

10:12.654 --> 10:16.365
-Come on, Charlie.
-Away you go with your mother.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.827
Why don't you try one
of her bras on, wee girl?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.246
Flaunt away, you fairy!

10:22.455 --> 10:23.580
Hey, Mom.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.500
I brought you guys a haggis.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.504
That's sweet of you, son.
Thank you.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.425
I haven't seen one of these for years.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.970
Actually, I hate them.
But your father wilI--

10:38.972 --> 10:44.393
Look. He's giving Tony all that
Lyndon H. LaRouche rubbish again.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.897
It's a known fact, Sonny Jim,
that a secret society...

10:49.149 --> 10:53.110
...of the five wealthiest people,
known as the Pentavirate...

10:53.320 --> 10:57.406
...run everything in the world,
incIuding the newspapers...

10:57.657 --> 11:01.994
...and meet tri-annually at a secret
mansion in CoIorado known as...

11:02.370 --> 11:05.789
-..."The Meadows."
-Who's in the Pentavirate?

11:06.082 --> 11:09.626
The Queen, the Vatican,
the Gettys, the Rothschilds...

11:09.836 --> 11:12.921
...and Colonel Sanders,
before he went tits-up.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.301
I hated the Colonel,
with his wee beady eyes...

11:17.552 --> 11:22.765
...and that smug look on his face.
"You're gonna buy my chicken."

11:23.183 --> 11:26.143
Dad, how can you hate the Colonel?

11:26.394 --> 11:29.188
He puts addictive chemicals
in chicken...

11:29.397 --> 11:32.316
...making you crave it fortnightly,
smart-ass!

11:32.650 --> 11:34.902
Interesting. Cuckoo.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.073
Charlie, would you Iike a juice?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.912
Look at what I've bought myself,
a Juice Tiger.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.665
-A Juice Tiger?
-Yes, I juice everything now.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.334
I'm on a new diet.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.129
I'm on a Weekly World News
Garth Brooks Juice Diet.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.839
Scores!

11:56.049 --> 11:59.468
-Margin, one-nil!
-Magic goal!

11:59.761 --> 12:02.137
Let's have a Iook at the replay.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.807
WiIliam, move your head.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.144
Look at the size of that boy's head.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.897
It's like an orange on a toothpick.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.567
-You'Il give him a compIex.
-That's a huge noggin.

12:15.777 --> 12:19.947
It's a virtual planetoid.
Has its own weather system!

12:20.448 --> 12:23.075
Head! Move!

12:24.786 --> 12:28.288
-Your Sherri's late.
-Mom...

12:28.498 --> 12:30.582
...Sherri and l broke up.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.293
Not Sherri?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.422
I liked Sherri.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.008
I didn't like the other girls
you brought home.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.972
-Don't make it any harder for me.
-Why should l make it easier, son?

12:45.223 --> 12:49.017
You were good together,
you and Sherri.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.564
-I thought you'd marry.
-You know I'm terrified of marriage.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.859
I know that, son. l know that.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.114
Maybe it's better not to marry.
Did you read the paper?

13:02.323 --> 13:05.033
-No.
-No? Where did I put it?

13:05.285 --> 13:08.203
Stuart! Bring in the paper!

13:08.538 --> 13:10.122
All right, hon!

13:10.373 --> 13:13.000
Head! Paper! Now!

13:13.251 --> 13:16.044
Move that melon of yours
if you can.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.590
Hauling that gargantuan
cranium about.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.426
No kidding. His head's like Sputnik.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.012
Spherical, but pointy in parts.

13:25.847 --> 13:27.848
That was offside, wasn't it?

13:28.099 --> 13:32.186
He'lI be crying himself to sleep
tonight on his huge piIlow.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.899
Mom, why do you refer to
Weekly World News...

13:37.108 --> 13:41.153
...as "the paper"?
The paper contains facts.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.406
This paper contains facts.

13:44.657 --> 13:50.037
And this paper has the eighth-highest
circulation in the whole wide world.

13:50.246 --> 13:54.166
Plenty of facts.
"Pregnant Man Gives Birth."

13:54.375 --> 13:56.293
That's a fact.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.088
Here it is, look. Read this.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.426
"Mrs. X. The honeymoon murderer."

14:05.512 --> 14:10.933
She marries men under fake identities
and then she murders them.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.477
She's murdered three men already.

14:13.645 --> 14:16.980
Victim number one
was a lounge singer.

14:17.232 --> 14:20.776
Victim number two,
a Russian martial arts expert.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.319
No!

14:23.029 --> 14:27.699
And she's also killed a plumber
named Ralph Elliot.

14:30.078 --> 14:33.622
And her whereabouts are unknown.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.905
Give us a kiss, Tony,
and cheer me up. Good night.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.574
Good night.

15:14.330 --> 15:18.375
Wow, you've turned into a sexy
wee bastard. You know that?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.168
Thanks, Mrs. MacKenzie.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.504
-Hasn't he?
-I think so.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.591
-Good night, Mom.
-Good night, Charlie.

15:25.842 --> 15:30.762
-Good night, Dad.
-Fine, go. You've stayed your hour.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.232
Yes.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.360
-Morning, Charles.
-Morning, sir.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.282
Are you working on the forms
for the vendor--?

16:32.575 --> 16:33.784
Yes, captain.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.745
Tony? Tony?

16:40.958 --> 16:44.586
I don't want to intrude,
but you seem a Iittle down.

16:45.588 --> 16:49.257
Well, captain, it's about my job.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.762
I'm having doubts about being a cop.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.265
It's not like how it is on TV.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.936
I fill out forms and paperwork
all day.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.400
Point welI taken, but even though
it's not exciting...

17:06.608 --> 17:08.068
...it's very important.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.780
Yeah, but of alI my times as a cop,
I've never....

17:11.989 --> 17:15.200
I never chased a guy
across a crowded square.

17:15.451 --> 17:20.288
I've never hung onto that part of
the helicopter. You know that part?

17:20.498 --> 17:22.249
-You know?
-I know it.

17:22.458 --> 17:26.502
I've never hung onto that
or even commandeered a vehicle.

17:26.753 --> 17:30.924
-That sounds like a lot of fun.
-That's the other thing.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.592
You're too nice.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.972
-I'm too nice?
-Yes, you're too nice.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.267
Why not be like a
Starsky and Hutch captain?

17:40.476 --> 17:44.146
Where you haul me in your office
and bawl me out...

17:44.439 --> 17:48.775
...because you're tired of defending
me from the commissioner.

17:48.985 --> 17:52.654
The truth is, l report to a committee.

17:52.864 --> 17:56.783
Some are appointed, elected,
or co-opted biannually.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.035
-It's a quorum, so to speak.
-A quorum?

17:59.203 --> 18:03.957
-Yeah.
-I thought l was gonna be Serpico...

18:04.167 --> 18:07.878
...but instead l'm Iike Fish
from Barney Miller.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.380
Hey, somebody needs a hug.

18:11.841 --> 18:12.841
Captain.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.475
Okay, coming up.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.072
-Hi.
-Haggis, right?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.201
Yeah, I'm the guy
who ordered the haggis.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.204
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.540
-Do you like haggis?
-No, it's repeIlent.

18:45.792 --> 18:49.002
I think Scottish cuisine
is based on a dare.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.379
-I'm next.
-You're next.

18:51.589 --> 18:52.923
Yes, can I help you?

18:53.174 --> 18:58.220
I'll tell you how you can help me.
All I want is one New York steak...

18:58.429 --> 19:02.098
...a quarter-inch thick.
That's all. No more, no less.

19:02.350 --> 19:06.394
-Get it and let me out.
-I'm reaIly busy. Be right back.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.567
-It's busy, hey?
-It's insane today.

19:12.819 --> 19:17.364
My dad's a butcher,
and l used to work at his shop.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.575
-I can help you.
-I'd Iove some help.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.245
-Great, what's your name?
-Charlie.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.121
-Harriet.
-Hi, Harriet.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.208
-Could you get four porterhouses?
-Okay.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.514
Just kidding.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.141
Hi.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.660
So do you live in New York?

20:46.037 --> 20:47.203
Really?

20:47.663 --> 20:52.667
Just teIl me if that's too tense.
You guide me. You guide me.

20:57.965 --> 21:01.009
Mom, can you get the school nurse?

21:01.218 --> 21:03.428
Get the school nurse! Help me!

21:03.679 --> 21:06.514
It was an accident in shop.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.186
Get me a tourniquet?
Anything.

21:22.031 --> 21:25.200
Thanks for helping me out
at the butcher shop.

21:25.493 --> 21:28.370
-You were really nice.
-Oh, I was nice?

21:28.579 --> 21:32.832
"Nice." Evidently you think of me
as a woman friend.

21:33.042 --> 21:36.211
-And what is wrong with being nice?
-Nothing.

21:36.879 --> 21:37.879
-Charlie?
-Yes?

21:38.047 --> 21:41.591
-Name a bad thing you've done.
-I've done bad things.

21:41.842 --> 21:46.012
Tell me one bad thing you've done,
and it better be evil.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.059
-How evil?
-Really eviI.

21:51.227 --> 21:55.105
So evil that you wouId
say it was "e-vil."

21:55.398 --> 21:59.067
Like it's the fruits of the Devil.
"E-vil."

22:00.569 --> 22:04.531
For example, how many people
have you brutally murdered?

22:06.742 --> 22:09.244
"Brutal" is a very subjective word.

22:09.495 --> 22:14.916
What's brutal to one person might
be reasonable to somebody else.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.645
Excuse me.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.787
Do you know Russian?

22:54.540 --> 22:56.124
Yeah.

22:56.542 --> 23:00.420
Oh, this hurts. No, this is hard.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.923
Not only are you
extremeIy good-looking...

23:04.133 --> 23:07.969
...but you're also very smart
and that's no fair.

23:08.179 --> 23:11.139
-That's hard.
-Bright women intimidate you?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.808
No, no. Not at alI.

23:14.477 --> 23:17.937
But it's a shame I'm going
to have to destroy you.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.322
-Charlie, come here!
-Nadia...

23:27.490 --> 23:29.074
...l am coming.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.582
Expand, contract, expand.

23:38.334 --> 23:41.336
What do you look for
in a woman you date?

23:42.880 --> 23:46.674
I know everyone always says
sense of humour...

23:46.967 --> 23:49.719
...but l have to go with breast size.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.388
Oh, my God.

23:52.807 --> 23:56.017
Come! Let us dance like
chiIdren of the night.

24:05.402 --> 24:09.114
-Here we are.
-Wow, what a great pIace.

24:09.824 --> 24:12.033
-Some tea?
-Sure.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.536
Well, show yourself around.

24:19.208 --> 24:24.629
You know what this pIace needs?
A large poster of Atlantic City.

24:26.048 --> 24:28.550
Oh, Iook, you got one!

24:28.759 --> 24:31.678
I used to live there.
I have herbaI teas:

24:31.887 --> 24:34.264
Cubby Wubby Womb Room tea...

24:34.515 --> 24:38.017
-...and Morning Thunder.
-I'lI go with Cubby Wubby.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.395
All right, thanks.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.737
What's this?

24:57.163 --> 25:01.166
I had a friend who was
a martial arts expert and....

25:01.417 --> 25:04.961
-Oh, you had a friend?
-It's a martiaI arts thing.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.964
I thought it would
look good on the waIl.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.258
It does.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.553
You know, Scotland has
its own martial arts.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.388
It's called "fuck you!"

25:17.600 --> 25:21.686
It's mostly head-butting
and kicking people on the ground.

25:34.074 --> 25:37.118
-It's late.
-Not for me.

25:37.620 --> 25:41.080
-Who for, then?
-Who for, then, what?

25:41.290 --> 25:44.626
If not for you,
I wonder who it is Iate for.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.588
Not me, no.
I like the nightlife.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.215
I like to boogie.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.927
I'll make the tea, then.

26:07.441 --> 26:08.983
You know...

26:12.821 --> 26:14.614
...maybe it is late.

26:14.949 --> 26:18.826
I'll be honest with you.
I had a great time tonight...

26:19.745 --> 26:22.789
...and I'd really love to kiss you.

26:22.998 --> 26:28.378
But if I kiss you, we'll end up on
the couch, and if we end up there...

26:28.629 --> 26:32.548
...chances are we'll kiss
in the bedroom...

26:32.800 --> 26:35.969
...and that's the part
I always rush into.

26:36.178 --> 26:40.473
It's not a good idea to rush
into spending the night together.

26:40.849 --> 26:45.311
-I want to spend the night together.
-I have no problem with that.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.773
You're it.

26:50.859 --> 26:51.859
Come here!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.861
Oh, no! Oh, God!

27:02.371 --> 27:10.086
Yes.

27:12.589 --> 27:15.341
Ralph!

27:17.052 --> 27:19.846
I wilI. l will.

27:20.681 --> 27:23.016
Wait, not now! Not now!

27:23.309 --> 27:25.727
Ralph! Ralph!

27:27.688 --> 27:30.231
Harriet. Harriet.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.608
You were having a dream.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.864
And you kept saying the name
"Ralph."

27:42.911 --> 27:46.581
-RaIph?
-Yeah, you kept saying "Ralph."

27:52.755 --> 27:54.922
She's my friend.

27:56.467 --> 28:05.600
She's your friend. Ralph.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.602
Ralph. She.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.973
I'm sorry!
I thought you were somebody else!

29:03.951 --> 29:07.954
Hi.

29:08.330 --> 29:13.418
I'm Harriet's friend, Charlie.
You must be RaIph?

29:13.836 --> 29:15.962
I'm Harriet's sister, Rose.

29:16.547 --> 29:20.216
-She gave me a note to give to you.
-Great.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.970
"Dear Charlie,
I didn't want to wake you.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.349
Make yourself at home
and thanks for the...

29:29.476 --> 29:30.935
...hot dog. Harriet."

29:33.021 --> 29:35.481
That's a very nice note.

29:36.191 --> 29:41.320
-Let me make you some breakfast.
-I'd Iove to, but I'm running late.

29:41.530 --> 29:44.073
How do siIver-dollar pancakes...

29:44.324 --> 29:48.536
...fresh orange juice, bacon
and Kona coffee sound?

29:48.829 --> 29:50.204
It sounds great.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.963
Sorry. I didn't have
those other things.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.842
That's fine.
That other stuff will kill you.

30:03.051 --> 30:08.222
Whereas Froot Loops are light
and reasonably high in fibre.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.560
-I care for Apple Jacks a great deal.
-Got them.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.061
Good.

30:15.230 --> 30:19.066
So, is this your place?

30:19.276 --> 30:23.112
No, this is our place.
Harriet's and mine.

30:23.405 --> 30:27.241
She sort of comes and goes
but always ends up here.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.244
She didn't speak of me?

30:31.371 --> 30:34.248
No, she didn't speak of you.

30:34.541 --> 30:39.295
She mentioned a martial arts guy, and
there was discussion about Ralph?

30:40.255 --> 30:43.424
Oh, really? She spoke about them?

30:44.051 --> 30:49.430
She talked about the martial arts guy
and kind of shouted "Ralph."

30:58.565 --> 31:02.902
-Well, you know Harriet.
-Actually, l don't.

31:03.153 --> 31:06.781
-But you did have sex with her.
-HeIlo!

31:07.950 --> 31:09.450
I'm gonna go now.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.915
I won't tell Harriet
that anything happened.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.918
Well, Rose. Rose.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.673
Nothing did happen.

31:24.132 --> 31:27.969
Don't worry, Charlie.
Just be careful.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.185
"Just be careful."

31:40.065 --> 31:43.442
I had the greatest night of my life
last night.

32:09.469 --> 32:13.973
-Sounds like you reaIly like her.
-I'm smitten. l'm in deep smit.

32:14.182 --> 32:17.852
She is wonderful.
But we shouldn't taIk about it.

32:18.020 --> 32:21.022
I'll start analysing it,
and that's no good.

32:21.231 --> 32:25.026
That is good. You should
just let it happen. Relax.

32:25.694 --> 32:29.363
I am a park ranger,
and l will lead you on the tour.

32:29.615 --> 32:33.868
All the rangers at Alcatraz
were once guards, myself included.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.747
My name is John Johnson,
but everyone caIls me Vickie.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.415
Please follow me.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.711
-I love Vickie. He's great.
-He's the best.

32:44.755 --> 32:47.548
This is the main ceIlblock area.

32:47.758 --> 32:50.843
Home to such famous criminals
as Al Capone...

32:51.053 --> 32:54.055
...Mickey Cohen,
Joseph "Dutch" Cretzer...

32:54.264 --> 32:58.893
...and Robert Stroud,
the famous Birdman of Alcatraz.

32:59.061 --> 33:04.357
This time will be different.
If something happens, I'll let it go.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.568
It's not my business.
For example, Ralph.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.071
She says "Ralph" in her sleep.
So what?

33:10.280 --> 33:11.405
Ralph?

33:11.657 --> 33:14.033
This cell's for
solitary confinement...

33:14.242 --> 33:17.286
...that's come to be known
as Times Square.

33:17.579 --> 33:19.955
Make sure everyone gets a look.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.542
So who's RaIph?

33:23.752 --> 33:27.463
I don't know. More importantly,
I don't want to know.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.590
That's good.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.594
Did you and Harriet,
you know, last night?

33:33.804 --> 33:35.221
Okay, dirtbag.

33:35.430 --> 33:39.809
All you have to know is that Harriet's
a sweet and loving person.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.937
Well, that's good. That's nice.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.815
-And yes, we did.
-All right!

33:46.483 --> 33:49.610
Close it up, close it up, close it up.

33:51.947 --> 33:56.909
This is something the other
tour guides won't tell you.

33:57.244 --> 34:00.079
In this ceIlblock,
Machine Gun Kelly...

34:00.288 --> 34:05.000
...had what we call
in the prison system, a bitch.

34:05.293 --> 34:10.630
One night, in a jealous rage, Kelly
took a makeshift knife, or shiv...

34:11.299 --> 34:14.927
...and cut out the bitch's eyes.

34:15.637 --> 34:18.806
-Another thing about Harriet I Iove--
-No, no.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.484
And as if this wasn't enough
retribution for Kelly...

34:30.777 --> 34:36.114
...the next day he and four
other inmates took turns pissing...

34:36.324 --> 34:40.286
...into the bitch's ocular cavities.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.500
This way to the cafeteria.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.170
Tony, I'm really happy.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.466
Please, don't let me screw
this one up.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.885
-I'lI try.
-Alrighty. Thanks.

34:56.178 --> 35:00.806
-That ocular cavity thing was--
-When he mentioned pissing into....

36:01.076 --> 36:04.745
Okay, l got another one.
What's worse?

36:04.955 --> 36:09.208
The cable goes out and you're left
with synchronized swimming...

36:09.417 --> 36:11.210
...or--

36:11.419 --> 36:12.586
Okay.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.589
You're stuck on the Bay Bridge
in traffic...

36:15.882 --> 36:21.053
...and you've just had two strong cups
of coffee and three bran muffins.

36:23.598 --> 36:27.434
-No, wait. I have a good one.
-HeIlo! HelIo!

36:27.727 --> 36:30.980
What's worse?
You go to your favourite restaurant...

36:31.273 --> 36:33.774
...order your favourite meal,
take a bite...

36:33.942 --> 36:37.987
...and under the steak
is a scabby Band-Aid.

36:38.238 --> 36:39.280
Or....

36:43.994 --> 36:46.245
Or being electrocuted.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.084
And?

36:52.294 --> 36:57.464
That's it. I was electrocuted once.
It was horrible.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.634
-Oh, well, that's....
-That's a crying shame.

37:03.013 --> 37:06.473
Can we get our cheque, please?
Thanks a lot.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.934
Electrocuted.

37:09.144 --> 37:10.185
That was funny.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.313
-I'lI get that.
-No, I got it.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.442
-I'lI get it. Charlie.
-No, it's mine. No, no, no.

37:16.651 --> 37:20.654
-I got it. I insist.
-No, no, no.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.323
-"No" infinity.
-Come on.

37:22.616 --> 37:27.953
-Negatory, good buddy.
-You're embarrassing me.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.414
-I'lI pick up the cheque.
-Okay.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.337
You want to catch a cab?

37:36.546 --> 37:39.673
-I'd Iike to walk.
-Come on, it's raining.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.718
-I'd Iike to walk.
-Me too.

37:43.011 --> 37:45.471
-All right. See you later.
-Bye.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.723
Nice meeting you.

37:53.188 --> 37:56.732
-Well, it's officialIy raining.
-It's just a drizzle.

37:57.025 --> 38:02.363
You know, I love that you wanted
to walk in the rain.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.866
I'm gIad you're meeting
my parents tomorrow.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.826
You know what, Charlie?

38:08.036 --> 38:11.664
It's strange,
but I feel really safe with you.

38:11.873 --> 38:15.501
Like in old movies
when people never left each other.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.587
I mean, they stayed together forever.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.397
It's a great house.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.274
They moved in
the day they were married.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.112
I'm throwing them
a 30th wedding anniversary party.

38:51.121 --> 38:53.038
Mom, Dad, we're here.

38:53.248 --> 38:55.082
Stuart!

39:01.256 --> 39:03.382
Charlie!

39:03.591 --> 39:08.595
Is this the wee Harriet?
She's absolutely beautiful.

39:08.805 --> 39:11.765
And you're very, very weIcome.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.101
I hope you hold on to this one.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.813
You have the face of a wee angeI,
do you know that?

39:19.107 --> 39:22.401
I give! I give!
I'm Charlie's father.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.822
Sorry. I'm sorry.
You surprised me. I'm sorry.

39:27.115 --> 39:31.410
I like this one, Charlie.
She's quite a filly.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.288
Charlie tells me you're a butcher.

39:34.581 --> 39:36.540
Yes, I am a butcher.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.917
Do you Iink your own sausage?

39:39.794 --> 39:40.794
I do.

39:41.087 --> 39:44.757
-Why don't you put your trousers on?
-HoId your horses.

39:44.966 --> 39:48.302
Head! Pants! Now!

39:50.346 --> 39:52.264
Why don't you come with me?

39:52.474 --> 39:56.143
I have wonderfuI photos
of when he was a wee baby.

39:56.436 --> 39:59.855
Like one of him shitting
his pants at Niagara Falls.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.483
Come on, don't show her the pictures.

40:02.650 --> 40:07.863
Lighten up, Charlie. You've got
a pickle up your ass again.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.995
I'm going to the washroom, okay?

40:15.288 --> 40:18.499
Evidently, I have a pickle up my ass.

40:18.708 --> 40:23.128
-You'Il be okay if I leave you?
-Fine. Don't worry about me.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.299
Make sure there's enough paper.

40:27.509 --> 40:31.095
And Charlie, light a match!

40:31.304 --> 40:34.348
Are you away to crap, again?

40:40.355 --> 40:43.524
What a cute baby CharIie was!

40:43.733 --> 40:47.027
You okay in there?
You didn't fall in there, did you?

41:31.698 --> 41:35.409
I can't believe the resemblance
between you and Charlie.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.743
Thank you.

41:36.911 --> 41:41.790
That's enough about us.
Tell me something about yourself.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.918
Have you always lived
in San Francisco?

41:46.087 --> 41:49.882
No, actualIy I moved around
quite a bit.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.774
I had a really great time
with your family tonight.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.822
Oh, great.

42:16.201 --> 42:20.287
You know that martial arts
expert friend you had?

42:26.294 --> 42:28.962
Was that here in San Francisco?

42:30.006 --> 42:33.467
No, actualIy it was Miami.

42:34.469 --> 42:36.970
Your family's really great, CharIie.

42:37.263 --> 42:42.226
-When your mother took out--
-Was that before Atlantic City?

42:42.477 --> 42:46.813
It's a period in my life that
I really don't like talking about.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.525
Charlie.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.780
I hated Atlantic City, Charlie.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.659
It's a town full of gamblers
and lounge singers.

43:12.173 --> 43:13.674
Ralph?

43:13.883 --> 43:16.385
No. No.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.513
Oh, Ralph.

43:25.979 --> 43:28.272
Have you heard of this? Mrs. X.

43:28.481 --> 43:30.148
She murders her husbands...

43:30.316 --> 43:33.151
...then changes her identity
and marries again.

43:33.361 --> 43:36.029
I never heard of it. So what?

43:38.199 --> 43:41.034
I think I'm dating Mrs. X.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.496
Charlie.

43:46.708 --> 43:50.294
Two words. Therapy.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.590
She told me she dated
a martial arts expert.

43:55.883 --> 44:00.053
It says that one of the victims
was a martial arts expert.

44:00.305 --> 44:04.558
Last night, she put a move
on my dad and tried to break his neck.

44:04.809 --> 44:08.395
About 1 000 people
have tried to break his neck.

44:08.688 --> 44:13.066
If they also say "Ralph" in their
sleep, it's a good start.

44:13.318 --> 44:15.068
Look here, "RaIph Elliot.

44:15.320 --> 44:20.032
Plumber from Dallas.
Missing since his honeymoon."

44:20.241 --> 44:23.410
-Charlie, you're just getting scared.
-Yes.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.620
-Harriet could be the one.
-Yes.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.624
You suspect her, because
you're scared you'll marry her.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.543
And to you that's death.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.588
Come on, just read it, okay?

44:34.839 --> 44:40.344
-Read it. For me, just read it?
-Okay.

44:45.224 --> 44:47.768
-"Larry Leonard, the croner..."
-Crooner.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.770
"...made a name for himself...

44:49.979 --> 44:53.857
...being able to sing, in six
languages, 'Only You."'

44:54.108 --> 44:57.069
Does Harriet know
the words to "Only You"?

44:57.779 --> 45:00.155
We haven't reached that critical...

45:00.448 --> 45:03.283
..."do you know the words
to 'Only You"' phase.

45:03.576 --> 45:06.870
-So I'm afraid I'm not much heIp.
-Charlie!

45:07.121 --> 45:09.247
You gotta move past this!

45:09.457 --> 45:13.752
I'm worried. You're living
according to the Weekly World News.

45:13.961 --> 45:19.424
It's the 8th highest circulating paper
in the worId, I'lI have you know.

45:19.801 --> 45:21.802
Look, Tony, Mrs. X.

45:22.011 --> 45:24.596
Please, look it up, okay?

45:24.806 --> 45:27.682
For me? Indulge me?

45:28.893 --> 45:30.936
There's no record of deaths.

45:31.145 --> 45:35.941
All three were reported missing,
but so were their wives.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.695
No picture of any brides. For
all we know, they just moved away.

45:40.947 --> 45:44.282
That's true.
You're gonna have to realise that.

45:44.492 --> 45:49.329
I would lie to you,
but Kathy always tells the truth.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.164
Understood.

45:51.416 --> 45:52.833
You feel better now?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.461
-I guess so.
-Good, good. Come on.

46:01.634 --> 46:05.220
I'm Maureen O'Boyle.
Welcome to A Current Affair.

46:05.471 --> 46:08.682
Tonight: Amy, did she or didn't she?

46:08.933 --> 46:12.144
Then, the reptile
that took Hollywood by storm.

46:14.814 --> 46:19.025
But first, the Justice Department
reports an alarming rise...

46:19.235 --> 46:22.529
...in the number
of poisoning murders.

46:22.697 --> 46:27.200
And that 87 percent of the murders
occur within the family...

46:27.452 --> 46:31.830
...a scourge which seems to be
reaching into every home.

46:32.039 --> 46:35.584
Steve Dunleavy examines
poisoning murders. Steve.

46:35.877 --> 46:39.171
The most common poisonings
occur between couples.

46:39.380 --> 46:43.008
For reasons as varied
as insurance fraud, jealousy...

46:43.217 --> 46:46.219
...and pure psychopathic behaviour.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.388
-Hi.
-Hi. Hi.

46:51.267 --> 46:53.560
I have a surprise for you.

46:53.728 --> 46:54.895
What is it?

46:55.104 --> 46:57.189
It's a health shake.

46:58.399 --> 47:00.734
I made it especiaIly for you.

47:00.902 --> 47:02.277
Try it.

47:05.406 --> 47:07.574
Thank you, no. Thanks.

47:08.576 --> 47:11.745
You'll like it, Charlie.
Just take a sip.

47:12.038 --> 47:16.249
I have kitten breath.
I'm just gonna go brush my teeth.

47:16.417 --> 47:18.627
Why don't you just taste it?

47:18.920 --> 47:21.213
It's got strawberries.
Taste it.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.256
I spent 20 minutes making it.

47:23.424 --> 47:27.719
-One little sip. It wouldn't hurt--
-I'm just gonna go.

47:35.520 --> 47:38.104
Fine. Forget it. Forget it.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.983
I'm sorry.

48:23.484 --> 48:25.277
That's okay.

48:25.820 --> 48:29.489
I'm just sensitive.

48:29.699 --> 48:34.327
I mean, you didn't drink my shake.
So what? Right?

48:34.495 --> 48:38.999
Look, you spent a half an hour on it.
I understand.

48:39.166 --> 48:40.875
-Let's scratch.
-It's depressing.

48:41.127 --> 48:42.502
-Scratch.
-Scratch?

48:42.670 --> 48:43.670
Scratch.

48:43.838 --> 48:46.840
Come on.
Let's do a littIe scratching.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.676
There you go. Scratching.

48:49.885 --> 48:51.970
-Golden Gate Bridge.
-Golden.

48:52.179 --> 48:55.098
-Presidio. Union Square.
-Got it.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.850
-Little Japan.
-Got it.

48:57.143 --> 48:58.852
Union Square.

48:59.145 --> 49:02.856
-Oakland. Oakland.
-Oakland.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.900
Can you reach around
and get Coit Tower?

49:06.152 --> 49:08.194
-San Andreas Fault.
-Charlie.

49:08.362 --> 49:11.031
You know what l like best about you?

49:11.324 --> 49:15.035
I can tell you anything,
and you don't judge me.

49:15.202 --> 49:20.540
Charlie, have you ever stood
at the edge of a cliff...

49:20.750 --> 49:24.002
...or subway platform with someone...

49:24.211 --> 49:27.839
...and you thought
just for a split second:

49:28.924 --> 49:30.925
What if I pushed him?

49:31.177 --> 49:35.388
I foIlow the Judeo-Christian
ethic of "Thou shalt not kill."

49:35.681 --> 49:39.392
-But that's just me.
-I'm just making a point...

49:39.644 --> 49:43.229
...of how many times we trust
people with our lives.

49:43.439 --> 49:44.856
I mean, look at us.

49:45.066 --> 49:48.068
Look how vuInerable we are, sleeping.

49:48.277 --> 49:51.863
I could do anything
to you in your sleep.

49:52.073 --> 49:53.448
Like what?

49:53.699 --> 49:55.450
Anything.

49:55.743 --> 49:59.371
You're on your side,
asleep, I could...

49:59.580 --> 50:02.874
...stick a needle in your--

50:07.421 --> 50:09.089
Charlie! Jesus!

50:09.382 --> 50:12.926
I'm showing you we have
a good relationship!

50:13.177 --> 50:16.054
I'm sorry, but I have an ear thing.

50:16.263 --> 50:20.392
In an episode of Night Gallery,
this guy gets an earwig.

50:20.601 --> 50:23.770
They said the good news
is, we got the earwig...

50:23.979 --> 50:27.065
...but the bad news
is, it was a female.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.817
-I'm sorry.
-Good night.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.985
-I have an ear thing.
-Good night.

50:31.278 --> 50:33.613
I'm sorry.

50:33.906 --> 50:38.493
-I'm a human blanket.
-Get off. Just, good night.

50:42.289 --> 50:43.957
Well, good night.

51:07.314 --> 51:08.815
Can l help you?

51:09.108 --> 51:11.317
I'd like to place an announcement.

51:11.610 --> 51:14.320
It's my parents' 30th anniversary.

51:14.530 --> 51:16.656
That's $4.50 per word...

51:16.866 --> 51:20.326
...and you've got a choice
of standard or bold.

51:20.619 --> 51:22.996
You having a busy week, Frank?

51:23.247 --> 51:27.500
No, just these two.
It's been dead around here.

51:29.044 --> 51:32.839
I got this tourist,
heart attack on a cable car.

51:33.132 --> 51:36.050
Guy left his heart in San Francisco.

51:37.636 --> 51:39.179
Hey!

51:39.346 --> 51:43.141
That's a real person
you're taIking about.

51:43.350 --> 51:45.518
All right, l'm sorry.

51:45.770 --> 51:50.315
There's another one.
San Francisco plumber: Elliot, Ralph.

51:51.776 --> 51:54.027
Disappeared four months ago.

51:54.195 --> 51:56.988
The body was found in a sewer.

51:57.198 --> 52:01.201
Guy takes his job too seriously,
life goes down the drain.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.373
Did they mention his wife?

52:07.541 --> 52:12.378
I know that we're talking
about real people here, so I'm sorry.

52:12.546 --> 52:15.048
Seriously, did they mention the wife?

52:15.341 --> 52:19.886
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to joke about other people's lives.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.555
I'm serious. Did they mention--?

52:22.848 --> 52:26.100
You win, okay? I'm a bad person.

52:26.393 --> 52:29.395
-Take it easy.
-No, he's saying l'm a shit.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.105
Did they mention the wife?

52:31.357 --> 52:33.024
Did they mention the wife?!

52:33.234 --> 52:37.570
No! They didn't mention the wife!
You happy?

52:37.863 --> 52:41.574
Yes, I'm insensitive!
I'm a very insensitive man!

52:41.826 --> 52:47.205
Stop! Look at the insensitive man!
That's why they pay you!

52:50.084 --> 52:51.751
He was my ride home.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.755
Understood.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.262
Why did you have to
see me so urgently?

53:02.471 --> 53:04.430
You couldn't come to my apartment?

53:04.640 --> 53:06.766
It's just safer here.

53:07.101 --> 53:09.477
What? CharIie.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.107
I'm sorry.

53:14.567 --> 53:17.235
I think you're a terrific woman.

53:18.571 --> 53:21.948
I just don't think we should
see each other anymore.

53:24.952 --> 53:27.954
Why? And tell me the truth.

53:30.291 --> 53:33.418
I'm afraid that you're gonna k--
Leave me.

53:34.128 --> 53:36.421
I'm gonna cleave you?

53:36.922 --> 53:39.799
-What does that mean?
-No, leave me.

53:39.967 --> 53:41.801
That you'll reject me.

53:42.011 --> 53:46.139
So l just thought
I'd do a preemptive strike.

53:46.307 --> 53:49.142
So you're rejecting me?

53:49.977 --> 53:52.478
I didn't mean to hurt you.

53:53.272 --> 53:55.607
I never wanted to hurt you.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.194
Don't worry, you haven't.

54:00.487 --> 54:02.655
At least you left early on.

54:06.452 --> 54:09.996
So that's it, then?

54:14.335 --> 54:17.045
Because I gotta get back to work.

55:00.214 --> 55:03.549
Woman
Woe man

55:03.759 --> 55:06.552
Whoa man

55:06.762 --> 55:10.348
We had love not just sex
Is she Mrs. X?

55:10.557 --> 55:14.394
I had to run for my life

55:23.404 --> 55:27.573
Jane, get me off of this crazy thing

55:27.741 --> 55:29.617
Called love

56:06.113 --> 56:07.113
Hello.

56:07.281 --> 56:11.576
Not that it matters,
but I thought you'd like to know...

56:11.785 --> 56:14.245
...somebody admitted
murdering Ralph.

56:14.455 --> 56:16.581
What about the others?

56:16.790 --> 56:18.958
She just confessed to the one.

56:19.251 --> 56:23.087
Anyway, crime to stop. Gotta go.
Catch you later.

56:44.068 --> 56:46.277
-It's me, CharIie.
-Go away.

56:46.487 --> 56:51.199
I gotta talk to you. I made a big
mistake. I'm an idiot.

56:51.492 --> 56:53.493
I'll go into therapy, okay?

56:53.702 --> 56:58.873
I'll go twice a week. I don't know
if insurance wiIl cover it, but....

57:01.835 --> 57:03.127
What is it?

57:03.796 --> 57:05.588
Hi, Charlie.

57:16.183 --> 57:17.850
I don't want to lose you.

57:18.644 --> 57:20.394
You didn't. You rejected me.

57:20.646 --> 57:24.357
Okay, l'm un-rejecting you.

57:26.819 --> 57:30.530
You'll do it again, Charlie.
You'll do it again.

57:30.864 --> 57:33.908
No, I'm not gonna do it again.

57:36.203 --> 57:38.746
Look, I got scared, okay?

57:39.039 --> 57:43.918
Things were going reaIly good
and then I just got scared.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.551
I love you.

57:53.011 --> 57:55.388
I love you too.

58:00.727 --> 58:04.188
But you blew it, Charlie.
You blew it.

58:27.087 --> 58:29.922
Harriet, Harriet

58:30.174 --> 58:34.051
Hard-hearted harbinger of haggis

58:34.261 --> 58:37.680
Beautiful, bemused

58:37.890 --> 58:40.933
Bellicose butcher

58:41.185 --> 58:44.228
Untrusting

58:44.605 --> 58:47.315
Unknowing

58:47.816 --> 58:50.943
UnlovÃ©d

58:57.951 --> 59:00.995
He wants you back
He screams into the night air

59:01.288 --> 59:05.458
Like a fireman going to a window
That has no fire

59:09.796 --> 59:13.132
Except the passion of his heart

59:13.717 --> 59:15.927
I am lonely

59:16.929 --> 59:19.472
It's really hard

59:20.515 --> 59:22.934
This poem sucks

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.352
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.357
Harriet, somebody's downstairs
to see you.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:17.655
She'll be down in a moment.
And could you bring the car around?

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:19.865
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

01:00:20.075 --> 01:00:23.703
Charlie, come here.
I want you to meet a friend.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.705
This is Ralph.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:30.376
Ralph? Ralph? This is Ralph?

01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:33.045
-This is Ralph?
-Come on.

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:38.884
This is Charlie.

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:42.680
-Great to meet you.
-No, it's great to meet you.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:45.599
Yes, I love you so much.

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.184
Oh, God!

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.937
Charlie.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.398
I'm naked, aren't l?

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:56.902
Yes. Yes, you are naked.

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:09.832
Okay. l was just naked then.
Very nude.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:16.130
Nice to meet you and call me?

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.090
I wilI.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:48.996
Shut it!

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:56.462
I'd like to propose a toast.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.799
To my wife, May.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:05.888
Thirty years ago today,
May and l were married.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.809
Some of you were there.
Some weren't born.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:12.269
And some of you are now dead!

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:17.817
But we both said, "I do," and we
haven't agreed on a thing since.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.112
That's true.

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:23.656
But l'm glad I married you...

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:27.201
...because it could have been worse.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.331
And besides...

01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:35.000
...l still love you.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.552
Thank you.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:54.478
Tony, would you like to dance?

01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.692
Let's dance.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:09.702
It must be a great feeling to have....

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:12.538
You okay?

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:15.791
No, I'm not. Harriet.

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:19.712
Marry me.

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:22.715
No.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:26.385
Please?

01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.847
Why not just live together?

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:33.893
We could live together first.
Let's just live together.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:37.480
Because I love you.
We shouId get married...

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:41.567
...and spend the next 30 years
of our life together.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:47.239
I want you to have my children.
And I want you to have your children.

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:51.285
That sounds like an awful
lot of children, but....

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:54.788
I love you.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.083
I need you.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.046
Let's just get married. Okay?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:04.089
Harriet...

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.258
...be my wife.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:09.929
All right, everyone,
shut your cake hole!

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:15.100
I'd like to make a toast
to my son, Charlie.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:18.395
Thanks for throwing this great party.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:22.942
I hope you have the same
great 30 years that we've had.

01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.402
To CharIie!

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.660
Yes.

01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:33.953
You wiIl?

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:36.455
Let's get married, Charlie.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:48.133
Now, Mr. MacKenzie, if you will
take this woman to be your wife...

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:53.097
...through thick and thin,
for better or for worse...

01:04:53.306 --> 01:04:54.974
...pIease say "I do."

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:56.850
I do.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:01.981
Now, Harriet, if you wiIl take this
man through good times and bad...

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:07.319
...forever and ever as your
husband, please say "I do."

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.960
I do.

01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:28.215
Now, CharIie,
kiss the beautifuI bride.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:56.118
Let's get pissed!

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:36.742
Hang a solo!

01:06:57.263 --> 01:07:01.975
We have a piper who's down.
It's all right, he's just pissed.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:06.605
We have a piper down.
I repeat, a piper is down.

01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.237
This is such a great party.

01:07:13.571 --> 01:07:15.447
-It is.
-The marriage was beautiful.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:16.949
-It was.
-It was great.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.576
Yeah. She's great, isn't she?

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:22.121
She's the best. She's incredibIe.

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:26.208
You've been such a chicken,
and finaIly, you met the one.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.752
How could you think
she was a killer?

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:51.233
Come here, Charlie.
Come stand by me, Charlie.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:08.602
Wait till you see this pIace.
It's called Poets' Corner.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.438
A lot of the Beat
poets used to go there.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.073
You're really quiet.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.743
Oh, I'm just thinking.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.912
Oh, okay. Well....

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:31.250
Why don't I do the talking
for you, all right?

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.417
Hi, my name is Harriet.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:37.756
Hi, Harriet. How's it going?
Good, good, l suppose.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:41.593
I think you're great, Charlie.
Everything you do is art.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:46.430
You're a sex machine. Get
on the scene with the sex machine.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:51.435
Thank you very much.
You're the best husband l ever had--

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.939
Why did you just say that?

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:55.983
It was a joke.

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:58.443
Why did you say it?

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.487
I thought it might be funny.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:04.449
Nothing, I just think you're
a great person. That's aIl.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:06.910
What?

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:11.498
-You're the best.
-No, no, no! Watch out!

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:23.552
I hear you've been working
the Ralph Elliot case.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:26.388
-Yes, captain.
-Don't "yes" me.

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:28.640
This is strictly homicide.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.309
I got a friend--

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:33.729
We all got these friends.
I'm warning you.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:38.233
Back off, Italian boy. Keep
away from this. lt's too big.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.569
Wait a minute.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:45.115
Trust me. I know what I'm
talking about. What's the news?

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:48.160
You want to hear news?
Here's the news.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.663
The lady that confessed
to Elliot's murder has...

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.457
...confessed to other crimes.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:54.917
I knew she would.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:57.628
To the murders of Abraham Lincoln...

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:02.007
...Warren G. Harding and
Julius Caesar. She's a nutcase.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:04.593
Oh, my God! I gotta go.

01:11:06.679 --> 01:11:11.683
Screw this up, and you'll
be writing parking tickets forever.

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:16.355
Captain, I won't let you down.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.112
Good for you. That was better.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:26.198
-Yeah?
-It was fantastic.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.951
-The beginning felt good.
-It was great.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.619
Too much in the end.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.204
No, it was terrific.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:35.499
-I need to save a life.
-I'lI work on it.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.542
Work on it, it was terrific.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:39.628
It was a big improvement.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.171
Thanks.

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:03.485
That is Ralph Elliot's wife.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:07.155
Of course her hair
was much shorter then.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.451
She's gained weight since then...

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.413
...but it's definitely her.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.458
Yeah, that's her. He was
really in love with her...

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:22.671
...but l tell you, she was fun,
and smart. Doll-face too.

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.439
Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:45.944
This is really cool.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.780
Hi.

01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:52.117
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,
enjoy your honeymoon.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.120
When you leave, it'll be
far too soon.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.705
That's great.

01:12:57.582 --> 01:13:01.376
Four nights. Your dinner
reservations are at 9:00.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:02.627
Sounds great.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.298
Put candles by the bed.
With a storm, we lose power.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.301
That's cool. Did you
hear that? A storm.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.387
A storm. We'll be
snugly inside and....

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:14.723
You okay?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:21.980
I have a headache.
Excuse me, do you have a drugstore?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:26.151
-I need aspirin.
-Up the stairs, Mrs. MacKenzie.

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.072
Don't move.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.745
-You think she has a headache?
-What?

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:40.582
Nothing. Here's your key.
The Robbie Burns room.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.918
Oh, thanks. Thank you.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.928
-The circuits are down.
-Keep on trying.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:56.431
Tell the chief I chartered a plane.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:14:00.852
-Hey, paisan!
-What?

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:04.940
Screw up, l'll kick your
spaghetti butt back to Milan.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:06.691
Not now. Not now.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:10.821
-Too many ethnic slurs?
-It's not paisan, it's paisan.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.533
Hey, paisan.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:50.402
Hey, listen. How long is it
gonna take us to get there?

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:53.822
It shouldn't take very long.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.076
Actually, I have no concept of time.

01:14:59.912 --> 01:15:01.621
Jeez, is this dangerous?

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:06.334
No. WeIl, there's
chance in everything.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.422
You've done this before, right?

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:14.759
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I do this all the time.

01:15:14.927 --> 01:15:17.762
I've never done it at night.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.530
Mr. and Mrs. MacKenzie,
glad to see you.

01:15:36.741 --> 01:15:37.782
Follow me.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.880
How do you know
where you're going?

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:53.965
Instruments. lnstruments.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.718
Oh, yeah? Yeah? What's that?

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:02.390
That's the artificial horizon, which
is better than the actual horizon.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.397
You know, I'm gonna wash my hands.
All right? I love you.

01:16:34.298 --> 01:16:35.507
Good evening.

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:58.863
What are you doing? Wake up!

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:03.034
Oh, man, I was having
an amazing dream.

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:06.162
I don't care about
your dream! Land the plane!

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:13.628
I was just born, and l was
eight and a half months premature.

01:17:13.879 --> 01:17:16.548
-The doctors were freaking out.
-Shut up.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:19.050
Did I already tell you this dream?

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:25.390
Can l have your attention?
I have a few announcements.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.476
Celebrating their 25th
anniversary tonight...

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.271
...Mr. and Mrs. Seymour Levenstein.

01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:33.732
How about a hand for them?

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.026
Thank you, thank you.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:39.195
Twenty-five years ago,
they were here.

01:17:39.405 --> 01:17:43.658
Speaking of new couples,
Charlie and Harriet MacKenzie.

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:47.495
-They look great.
-There's a phone call for you.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.205
It is quite urgent.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:53.877
Oh, thank you. Sorry. Hello.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:57.881
-Charlie, you okay?
-Couldn't be better.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:18:01.426
Charlie, Iisten to me.
Harriet is Mrs. X.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:04.721
She killed Ralph and those
two other guys. I got a picture.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:08.099
It checked out. It's her, Charlie.
She's the murderer.

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.643
I called the police.
It'll take a while.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:13.021
Just stay where you are.

01:18:14.857 --> 01:18:16.149
Charlie?

01:18:16.359 --> 01:18:19.319
Hold on one second.
What should I do?

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.696
When the time comes,
you'll know.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.115
Thanks, thank you.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:28.745
Hello, hello, heIlo?!

01:18:29.997 --> 01:18:33.208
Charlie? Charlie?!

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.085
-HeIlo!
-What happened?

01:18:35.336 --> 01:18:37.962
The phone died!
I was talking, and it died.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:42.092
It's common. It will be out until
tomorrow. Have a nice meal.

01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:43.968
What happened?

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.846
Nothing. The phone lines went dead.

01:18:47.098 --> 01:18:49.349
We wish a long and beautiful life.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:53.436
We want to play your song,
The Platters, "Only You."

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:59.818
You can't go. You have
to wait for the wedding dance.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.529
We got a lot of traditions here.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:14.541
Stop! Excuse me. l'm with the
San Francisco Police Department.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.877
I would like to
commandeer this vehicle.

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:21.047
No.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:22.674
What do you mean, "no"?

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:27.595
I know you don't have the right
to commandeer my vehicle.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.640
Please, can I
commandeer this vehicle?

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:33.476
No.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.564
You're not gonna bend
on this thing, are you?

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:40.358
No.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:46.281
-Please.
-Go ahead.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.783
No, I don't want to. Charlie.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.037
Charlie?

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.380
Charlie!

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:04.883
Help me! l've married a...

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:10.722
...wonderfuI person who I love
and adore. Who I want--

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.183
They've had enough of this crowd.

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.518
They have better things to do.

01:20:15.728 --> 01:20:18.480
Let's put them
in the honeymoon chair.

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:26.696
-We did it on our honeymoon.
-It's just fun.

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:31.534
No, I haven't had my dessert yet.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:36.748
To the room! To the room!

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.472
Have a good night.

01:20:54.308 --> 01:20:55.934
Stay for a nightcap?

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:58.269
No. You two want to be alone.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:01.314
No, reaIly. Stay for a nightcap.

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:03.233
I really shouIdn't.

01:21:05.319 --> 01:21:07.529
Stay for a nightcap!

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:21.459
Charlie, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:23.586
Harriet, I, I....

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:28.883
Charlie, I've been married before.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:33.429
-Harriet, I already know that.
-You know about my husbands?

01:21:33.681 --> 01:21:35.306
Yes.

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.560
-Stay away from me!
-What are you doing?

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:40.728
Come on. Stay away from me.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:43.898
You don't understand.
Give me the axe!

01:21:45.192 --> 01:21:46.943
-Don't go!
-Get off me!

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.529
-Charlie! Don't go!
-Get off!

01:21:49.697 --> 01:21:52.031
Wait. Charlie.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.158
Charlie!

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:04.586
Would you mind not doing that?

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.296
This bothers you?

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:10.633
No, it's one of my favourite things.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:18.391
Don't go! Charlie! Charlie!

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.728
Charlie.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:27.150
Hello? HeIlo? Hello?!

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:35.074
"Dear Harriet. l just can't
handle the commitment.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:40.038
It's too hard. I'm leaving you.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:43.499
Love, Charlie"?
I didn't write this.

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:46.419
What the fuck?!

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:48.087
Rose!

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.715
What's happening?!
Charlie, open the door!

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:53.051
-Rose tried to kilI me.
-What?

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:56.137
Shut up! I wrote this note!

01:22:56.388 --> 01:22:58.514
You're not to be here when...

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:01.893
...this note has been
placed on the desk!

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:06.230
Do you understand me? You
took her away from me, Charlie.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.690
Like all the rest.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.567
I have had it!

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:15.448
You are going to die.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.411
Would you mind waiting?

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:23.539
I may need you to
help if I make an arrest.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.416
I'll need a ride--

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:27.794
Shucks. Thank you.

01:23:29.755 --> 01:23:33.883
What are you doing?!
Charlie, be careful.

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.726
Run, Charlie!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:48.272
Stop it! Stop this, Rose!
Help!

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:50.900
Somebody! Help!

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:55.238
Charlie!

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:03.079
Is that you? Help! Hurry.

01:24:15.843 --> 01:24:18.928
Hurry! I'm in here!
Who is it?!

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:23.975
Help! Who's there? Who's there?
Charlie?! Charlie, help!

01:24:24.143 --> 01:24:28.438
I'm in the closet. Come here.
Tony! Open the closet.

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:37.071
Charlie!

01:24:40.159 --> 01:24:41.534
Where are you going?

01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:45.329
We gotta go on the roof.
Charlie and Rose are on the roof.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:46.748
Charlie's on the roof!

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.958
-What're you doing?
-Shut up!

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:34.086
Let's just take this down a notch.

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:40.134
What you're saying is that
Rose killed your husbands...

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.346
...forged notes to make you
think they left?

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:48.559
Yes. Listen, that's them
up on the roof. Listen!

01:25:49.812 --> 01:25:51.979
You don't get it, do you?

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:58.402
We can talk here, or we can
talk about it downtown.

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:26.472
Charlie!

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:56.836
-Charlie!
-Harriet!

01:26:58.297 --> 01:27:00.756
-Charlie, I'm coming up!
-Hang on!

01:27:02.718 --> 01:27:04.302
Charlie.

01:27:16.315 --> 01:27:18.190
Charlie, be careful!

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:52.516
Rose!

01:28:07.991 --> 01:28:11.118
San Francisco police!
I got you!

01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:13.913
I got her, Charlie. I got her!

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:19.001
-Don't let me fall!
-Okay, Rose. Come on, we're going in.

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:20.670
Oh, sorry.

01:28:40.607 --> 01:28:43.025
Rose, jailbird

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:48.739
Happy in her cage
No longer full of rage

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.449
She roosts

01:28:56.456 --> 01:29:00.126
Harriet, sweet Harriet

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:02.128
You acted cuckoo

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:06.173
'Cause you thought I would leave you
Sweet bird

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.599
Harriet, sweet Harriet

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:22.023
So knowing, so trusting

01:29:22.858 --> 01:29:25.276
So lovÃ©d
