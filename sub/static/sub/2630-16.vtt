00:08.173 --> 00:09.508
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10.635 --> 00:13.929
- What are you guys doing up?
- We wanted to finish the crossword before bed.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.766
Do you know a six-letter
word for "red"?

00:18.685 --> 00:20.102
Dark-red.

00:21.604 --> 00:25.774
I think that's wrong, but there's a
connect-the-dots in here for you later.

00:27.235 --> 00:29.111
Hey, how, uh, about maroon?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.865
- Yes! You are so smart!
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.408
Aw.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.076
You guys are so cute.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.953
I know.

00:38.496 --> 00:40.205
All right. I'll see you in the morning.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.999
Okay.

00:54.262 --> 00:57.139
You know, I love doing crossword
puzzles with you, honey.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.348
Oh, me too.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.976
- Now, let's finish this and go to bed.
- Okay.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.603
There's only one left.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.273
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but...

01:07.442 --> 01:09.151
Cat.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.737
Yes. Ha.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.031
You are so smart!

01:16.076 --> 01:17.242
I love you.

01:17.410 --> 01:18.911
I love you too.

02:23.101 --> 02:24.143
Uh.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.727
We still need a tip.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.438
All right. Hold on.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.399
I got it.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.693
Nickel.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.445
- How much more do we need?
- Couple of bucks.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.573
Okay, dime.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.034
You guys should probably keep talking.
This could take a while.

02:41.619 --> 02:42.870
Wait, lookit!

02:43.037 --> 02:44.413
Whoa!

02:44.581 --> 02:46.456
Oh, my God. This is a police badge!

02:46.708 --> 02:50.961
Oh, cool. But why would a cop come
in here? They don't serve doughnuts. Ha.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.256
Can you discover the badge again?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.884
I think I can come up with something
better than that.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.345
I bet somebody's
missing that badge.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.640
I should take it back.
Ooh, but while I'm at the police station...

03:03.892 --> 03:05.809
...I could check their
Ten Most Wanted list.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.938
My friend Fritzi's been Number 11 forever.
This could be her year!

03:12.066 --> 03:14.568
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Joey.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.656
Is that my sweatshirt?

03:19.824 --> 03:23.285
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I borrowed it.
I was cold. I hope it's okay.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.914
It's just that, uh, if you wear
someone's sweatshirt...

03:27.165 --> 03:29.416
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.251
And I'm not him.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.046
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.464
No, no. No.

03:35.632 --> 03:38.258
It's going to be all
smelling like Monica.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.302
Are you saying I smell bad?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.511
No.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.931
You smell like a meadow.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.226
I'm sorry.

03:50.438 --> 03:51.480
What's with him?

03:51.731 --> 03:56.068
The last time Joey went to a meadow,
his mother was shot by a hunter.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.754
I still don't know.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.882
I'm sorry, I just want to make sure
I bought the right couch, one that says:

04:20.051 --> 04:24.388
"Kids welcome here,"
but that also says

04:24.639 --> 04:26.890
"Come here to me."

04:29.018 --> 04:32.604
What? You say that to kids?

04:33.022 --> 04:34.064
No, no, no.

04:34.232 --> 04:38.735
The "Come here to me" is,
you know, for the ladies.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.739
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch,
not a magic couch.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.076
Well, you picked a great couch.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.327
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:47.495 --> 04:48.996
- Sign here please.
- Sure.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.456
Oh, what's, heh...?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.084
The delivery charge
is almost as much as the couch!

04:54.335 --> 04:57.212
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.424
You know what? I'll take it myself.
Thank you.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.759
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.303
Yeah.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.268
Are you kidding?

05:12.061 --> 05:16.231
Come on. It's only three blocks.
Uh, it's not very heavy. Try it.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.655
- Oh, I can do it.
- Yeah.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.491
You two will really
enjoy that couch.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.411
We're, uh, not together.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.455
Oh, okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.415
Something didn't quite add up there.

05:38.963 --> 05:40.213
Ross.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.174
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Ross.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.469
Well, you. Her. Heh.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.471
I mean, she's very...

05:47.722 --> 05:48.930
...you know.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.807
And you're, like...

05:50.975 --> 05:52.809
...you know?

05:55.355 --> 05:59.191
Not that it's any of your business,
but we did go out.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.650
Really? You two?

06:00.818 --> 06:01.860
Yeah. Rach?

06:02.028 --> 06:05.572
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.075
Then tell him quickly.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.535
Fine. We went out.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.996
Not only did we go out...

06:13.164 --> 06:16.124
...we did it 298 times!

06:16.292 --> 06:18.001
Ross.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.045
Oh, my...

06:20.213 --> 06:24.091
Ugh, you kept count?
You are such a loser!

06:25.176 --> 06:29.096
A loser you did it with 298 times!

06:33.726 --> 06:35.435
Oh. Oh!

06:35.603 --> 06:39.940
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put
your cigarette out on a tree.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.817
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.737
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.865
I won't till I have
my next cigarette.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.325
Hold it!

06:50.576 --> 06:52.494
NYPD. Freeze, punk!

06:52.662 --> 06:54.121
What?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.916
That's right. You are so busted.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.334
Book them.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.089
- Who are you talking to?
- Save it, red!

07:04.465 --> 07:08.385
Unless you want to spend the night
in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.430
I am not going to apologize to a tree.

07:12.014 --> 07:15.642
You apologize to the tree right now,
or I am calling for backup.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.312
Backup! Backup!

07:19.480 --> 07:21.189
I'm sorry! Sorry!

07:21.399 --> 07:24.526
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!

07:26.446 --> 07:27.487
Okay.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.574
Didn't you say there was, um,
an elevator in here?

07:30.741 --> 07:34.119
Uh, yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!

07:35.413 --> 07:37.205
Okay, go left.

07:37.373 --> 07:39.541
Left. Left.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.128
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.047
Lift it straight up over your head.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.592
Straight up over your head. You can do it!

07:48.759 --> 07:50.010
You can do it!

07:50.178 --> 07:52.179
- Okay. You got it?
- Yeah.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.680
- Go, go.
- Good, good.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.016
You got it, right?
You got it, right? You got...

08:01.772 --> 08:04.816
Any chance you think
the couch looks good there?

08:06.235 --> 08:07.611
This guy was all...

08:08.988 --> 08:10.906
And I'm all,
"Buffay! Homicide!"

08:12.617 --> 08:14.409
It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.870
Phoebe, you were supposed to
take that back.

08:17.079 --> 08:19.414
I know, but I'm having so much fun
doing good deeds.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.543
Okay, but impersonating a police officer
is a serious thing. You can get arrested.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.254
You could get arrested
right now!

08:29.258 --> 08:32.760
All right, yeah, I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.433
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.644
Oh.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.395
Hi, Joe.

08:43.563 --> 08:46.274
Yeah. I didn't know
you guys were gonna be here.

08:46.442 --> 08:49.069
- Do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this.
- What? Why?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.030
- What is going on with you?
- Nothing.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.949
You've been acting strange all day.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.619
All right. There is something. I, uh...

08:58.412 --> 09:00.747
I kind of had a dream.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.875
But I don't want to talk about it.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.003
Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King
had said that?

09:08.714 --> 09:11.258
I kind of have a dream.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.386
I don't want to talk about it.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.390
Look, it involved Monica.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.434
You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing?
Oh, that is so cool.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.895
I can't tell you how many times
I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.732
Anyway, we were talking about your dream.
I love you. Your dream?

09:28.067 --> 09:31.403
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it.
I haven't dreamt about her like that...

09:31.612 --> 09:34.197
...since I found out
about you two-ish.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.453
What was the dream about?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.956
Well, okay.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.043
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.087
Like you guys were doing last night.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.465
So that's it. I'm in love
with Monica and I'll be moving out.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.428
Joey, come on. That doesn't mean
that you're in love with me.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.138
It doesn't?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.140
It could mean anything.
Like, uh...

10:00.391 --> 10:03.768
...all of a sudden you're jealous
that I've become the apartment stud.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.479
Kind of sounds like your dream, dude.

10:09.191 --> 10:13.612
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me
together, being close and stuff...

10:13.779 --> 10:16.156
...and you just wanna have that
with someone too.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.783
In the dream
I did enjoy the closeness.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.452
Okay, look.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.953
Are you attracted to Monica?

10:22.121 --> 10:24.414
Right here, right now,
are you attracted to her?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.836
- Not really.
- There you have it!

10:30.087 --> 10:33.465
Heh. Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!

10:34.842 --> 10:36.051
But that's good!

10:36.218 --> 10:39.387
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.098
No, I don't think it's just about
getting a girlfriend.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.725
Yeah, I could get a girlfriend.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.062
Yeah, we could sit in the chair
and do crossword puzzles.

10:47.229 --> 10:50.106
But are we ever gonna have
the closeness like you guys have?

10:50.524 --> 10:54.611
Monica and I were friends before
we started dating. Maybe that's it.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.696
Friends first?

10:56.906 --> 10:58.573
That's interesting.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.370
- You become friends after?
- No, never done that either.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.915
Um, do you guys have
a tape measure?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.833
Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.253
That's right.

11:25.267 --> 11:26.893
What's up, Joey?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.231
How you doing?

11:40.866 --> 11:43.368
- Excuse me. Is this your car?
- Yeah.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.746
Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here.
You're blocking the entrance.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.915
Don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

11:49.125 --> 11:54.045
It's a problem for me, which means
it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.757
So am I.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.761
Oh, no.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.058
Oh, okay. So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.269
I know that because I'm a cop too.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.021
All right. Keep up the good work.
Ten-four.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.899
Wait a second.
So, what precinct are you with?

12:15.401 --> 12:17.694
I'm with the, um, the 57th.

12:17.862 --> 12:21.197
- I know a guy in Homicide up there.
- I'm in Vice.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.909
In fact, I'm undercover
right now. I'm a whore.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.038
Who else is in Vice up there?

12:29.206 --> 12:30.999
Um, do you know, um...

12:31.250 --> 12:32.500
...Sipowitz?

12:33.335 --> 12:35.336
Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.757
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.

12:38.924 --> 12:40.967
I don't know him.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.472
Don't try to call him or anything.
Because he's not there. He's out.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.266
His, um, partner just died.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.312
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.939
I sure will. Take care.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.776
Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz
is gonna be all right.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.987
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons
is really good.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.742
Where'd you find my badge?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.494
Oh!

13:16.295 --> 13:20.340
Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me
and Ross a hand moving his couch?

13:20.508 --> 13:23.468
Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class.
But you know what?

13:23.677 --> 13:26.179
I guess I could blow that off for you.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.352
Thanks.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.648
Uh, let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.691
Boy, they are really tight.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.901
I know.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.195
That's not a bad situation
they got over there.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.905
Mm-mm.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.449
Thinking of getting me one of those.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.371
What's up, Joe?

13:51.539 --> 13:54.916
The reason I think Monica
and Chandler are so great...

13:55.167 --> 13:57.752
...is because they were friends first,
you know?

13:58.003 --> 14:02.298
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.884
I saw you first, so...

14:06.554 --> 14:07.804
- Heh.
- Mm-hm.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.517
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.939
You know, honey, um...

14:18.190 --> 14:20.483
...as, uh, flattered as I am...

14:20.734 --> 14:23.361
...that you saw me first...

14:24.154 --> 14:28.032
...uh, I just don't think we should be
cranking anything up.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.702
I'll treat you real nice.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.876
Oh!

14:38.043 --> 14:40.628
Yeah. Well, you know, um...

14:41.589 --> 14:46.718
Listen, I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

14:46.969 --> 14:51.097
But I think the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...

14:51.307 --> 14:54.767
...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.520
Don't hit on your existing friends.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.941
Won't that take longer?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.235
Yeah. Yeah.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.321
Oh, but once you find it...

15:06.572 --> 15:08.740
...it's so worth the wait.

15:09.867 --> 15:10.909
Yeah.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.160
I understand.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.162
Good.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.873
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.711
Come here to me.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.924
No, no. You come here to me.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.302
Hey, Ross.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.513
- Ahem, I brought reinforcements.
- Oh, great! You brought Joey?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.223
I brought the next best thing. Heh.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.975
Hey.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.521
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!

15:41.565 --> 15:45.526
I would be offended, but Monica
is freakishly strong, so...

15:46.153 --> 15:48.613
Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.740
Rach, that's you.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.951
That's the couch.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.244
Oh, what's that?

15:55.496 --> 15:56.955
Oh, that's me.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.916
Wow.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.670
Certainly think a lot of yourself.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.298
No. That's my arm.

16:11.595 --> 16:15.765
Oh, I see. I thought you just really,
really liked your new couch.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.645
Just follow my lead.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.480
Okay.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.941
Come on, Chandler.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.275
Ah.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.777
- All right.
- Okay.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.238
Here we go.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.864
All right. Ready?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.199
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.450
- Turn!
- Okay.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.660
Turn!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.245
Turn!

16:37.913 --> 16:42.208
- I don't think we can turn anymore!
- I don't think it'll fit!

16:42.376 --> 16:45.378
Yeah, it will.
Come on! Up, up, up!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.463
Up! Yes!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.966
Here we go! Pivot!

16:50.676 --> 17:01.894
Pivot!

17:02.062 --> 17:05.189
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

17:09.111 --> 17:11.612
I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.156
You think?

17:15.492 --> 17:19.244
All right, let's, uh, bring it
back down and try again.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.622
Oh.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.833
Whoa.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.881
I think it's really stuck now.

17:31.467 --> 17:35.011
- I can't believe that didn't work.
- I know. Me neither.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.971
I mean, you had a sketch.

17:38.807 --> 17:41.476
What did you mean when
you said "pivot"?

17:46.356 --> 17:47.398
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:47.566 --> 17:50.193
How's it going?
Did you make any new friends?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.945
Yeah. I met this woman.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.906
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.657
What's she like?

17:56.825 --> 17:58.534
Uh, well, she's...

17:58.702 --> 18:00.036
...really good in bed.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.790
I thought you were going to
try to be friends first.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.126
- Hey, it's all your fault.
- What? Why?

18:07.294 --> 18:10.463
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.467
I told her I wanted to
"build a foundation and be friends."

18:14.635 --> 18:19.430
Suddenly, through no fault of my own,
I became irresistible to her!

18:20.474 --> 18:21.808
And her roommate!

18:23.977 --> 18:25.728
What about the "closeness"?

18:26.146 --> 18:30.441
Closeness, schmosness! There was
three of us, for crying out loud!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.781
Who wants pizza?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.366
I do! I do! I do!

18:39.076 --> 18:42.954
This is great! Can you believe
I found this on the second floor?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.917
- Who is it?
- NYPD.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.169
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.964
Uh, just a minute, officer!

19:01.682 --> 19:06.310
- I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
- My God, it's him! It's that cop!

19:06.520 --> 19:10.523
- I can't believe he found me!
- Are you going to go to jail?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.901
If I'm going down,
you guys are going down with me.

19:15.821 --> 19:19.448
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one-to-three years minimum.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.742
Good luck, Chandler.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.208
You can arrest me, but you'll never
make it stick and you know it.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.753
I kind of don't have a choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?

19:32.921 --> 19:35.715
Yeah, as long as you understand
that I'm gonna call my lawyer.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.802
And once he puts you on the stand, he's
gonna make you look like a fool! Like a fool!

19:41.638 --> 19:43.598
I don't like looking foolish.

19:44.057 --> 19:48.227
Maybe, uh, I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.605
I would love it if I weren't here!

19:51.315 --> 19:55.359
Since, um, you're not going to jail
tonight, I was wondering if you'd, um...

19:55.611 --> 19:57.820
...like to go to dinner with me?

19:58.530 --> 19:59.780
- Me?
- Yeah.

19:59.948 --> 20:03.784
Ever since you flashed my badge at me,
I kind of can't stop thinking about you.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.830
You're the prettiest fake
undercover whore I've ever seen.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.417
Nice.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.923
Wow, I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.551
Yeah, I could've done it better,
but these people keep staring at me.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.972
Um, yeah, I'd like to go out
with you, officer.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.600
- Gary.
- Gary.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.769
- Okay, so it's a date.
- Yeah.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.563
I gotta ask you, though.
How did you know where to find me?

20:32.814 --> 20:35.900
Your fingerprints were all over my badge
so I ran them through the computer.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.778
This was listed as your last known address
so I checked it out.

20:38.946 --> 20:39.987
Oh, impressive.

20:40.155 --> 20:44.533
Not as impressive as you. I looked at your
record and you've done some weird stuff.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.410
We'll talk at dinner.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.828
Okay.

20:47.996 --> 20:50.039
So I'll come by in a couple hours
and pick you up?

20:50.207 --> 20:51.707
- All right, I can't wait.
- Okay.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.710
Don't worry, I won't just
take you out for doughnuts.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.507
He has a gun!

21:06.014 --> 21:09.642
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.066
You want to return this couch?

21:18.527 --> 21:21.195
It's cut in half.

21:22.072 --> 21:26.325
- That's what I'm telling you.
- Did you cut this couch in half?

21:27.744 --> 21:30.788
This couch is cut in half!

21:32.249 --> 21:37.295
I would like to exchange it for one
that is not cut in half.

21:37.546 --> 21:41.048
You're telling me this couch
was delivered to you like this?

21:41.216 --> 21:43.426
Look, I'm a reasonable man.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.679
I will accept store credit.

21:47.389 --> 21:51.392
I'll give you store credit
in the amount of $4.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.522
I will take it.
