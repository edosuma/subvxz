11:47.290 --> 11:49.167
HE'S SUCH A FLIRT.

HE'S A PLAYER,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.461
AND I'M TELLING YOU,

11:51.503 --> 11:53.004
HE FLIRTS

11:51.503 --> 11:53.004
WITH EVERYBODY.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.255
BELIEVE ME,

11:53.046 --> 11:54.255
I DIDN'T THINK

11:54.297 --> 11:55.507
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS

11:54.297 --> 11:55.507
SPECIAL OR ANYTHING.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.134
AW, YOU ARE SPECIAL.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.345
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.061
'CAUSE I WANT TO SEE

12:06.184 --> 12:08.061
IF SHE KEEPS THIS JOB.

12:08.102 --> 12:10.230
I'M NOT ABOUT TO REWARD HER

12:08.102 --> 12:10.230
IF SHE QUITS.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.941
OKAY.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.861
I THINK THAT'S IT.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.906
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO NEIMAN'S

12:16.903 --> 12:19.906
AND PICK UP MY MANOLOS?

12:19.947 --> 12:20.990

12:19.947 --> 12:20.990
HOLDING THEM FOR ME.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.158
NEIMAN'S?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.284

12:33.545 --> 12:34.879
I WANT SO MANY THINGS,

12:34.921 --> 12:37.716
BUT IN TERMS

12:34.921 --> 12:37.716
OF WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR ME,

12:37.756 --> 12:40.009
I WANT A CHANGE.

12:40.051 --> 12:43.346
I WANT SOMETHING NEW.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.392
EXCELLENT.

12:47.434 --> 12:51.521
OKAY.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.690
YEAH.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.900
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.112
JUST TAKE THIS OFF.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.073
THERE'S SOME SMOCKS

12:59.153 --> 13:02.073
IN THE BACK.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.958
DO YOU LIKE IT?

13:11.999 --> 13:13.334
YES.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.128
IT'S PROSECCO.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.130
IN NORTHERN ITALY,

13:15.169 --> 13:17.130
THEY SERVE IT ON TAP.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.881
THANKS.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.593
IT'S LOVELY,

13:18.923 --> 13:21.593
ISN'T IT?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.845
MM-HMM.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.014
I LIKE TO START

13:24.887 --> 13:27.014
WITH SOMETHING BUBBLY,

13:27.056 --> 13:28.391
BUT I FIND CHAMPAGNE

13:28.433 --> 13:30.644
CAN BE TOO FULL

13:28.433 --> 13:30.644
OF EXPECTATION.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.604
I LIKE TO KEEP

13:30.685 --> 13:32.604
THINGS SIMPLE.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.445
SO HOW DID YOU

13:38.401 --> 13:40.445
MEET HARRY?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.198
THROUGH A FRIEND.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.284
I HAVE TO SAY,

13:46.326 --> 13:47.910
WHEN HE TOLD ME

13:46.326 --> 13:47.910
I SHOULD COME SEE YOU,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.954
I THOUGHT HE WAS

13:47.952 --> 13:49.954
FULL OF SHIT,

13:49.996 --> 13:52.206
AS USUAL,

13:52.248 --> 13:53.416
BUT THEN ELLIE ZIMMER

13:53.458 --> 13:54.542
WALKED INTO

13:53.458 --> 13:54.542
THE LACMA BENEFIT

13:54.584 --> 13:56.294
TWO WEEKS AGO,

13:56.336 --> 13:58.379
AND I ALMOST DIDN'T

13:56.336 --> 13:58.379
RECOGNIZE HER.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.631
I MEAN, THAT WOMAN

13:58.421 --> 13:59.631
HAS NOT LOOKED GOOD

13:59.673 --> 14:01.174
IN 12 YEARS,

14:01.215 --> 14:04.761
BUT THERE SHE WAS,

14:01.215 --> 14:04.761
LOOKING STUNNING.

14:04.803 --> 14:08.306
YOU DID AN AMAZING JOB.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.099
THANK YOU.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.733
SO HOW DID YOU GET HARRY

14:15.689 --> 14:18.733
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.738
WELL, I DIDN'T

14:20.819 --> 14:23.738
SLEEP WITH HIM.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.783
THE GIFT OF THE MAGI

14:26.825 --> 14:28.159
IS ONE OF THE MOST

14:26.825 --> 14:28.159
PERFECT STORIES

14:28.201 --> 14:29.619
THAT'S EVER

14:28.201 --> 14:29.619
BEEN WRITTEN.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.412
TALK ABOUT ECONOMY

14:29.661 --> 14:31.412
OF LANGUAGE.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.455
IF IT'S A SUCCESS,

14:32.497 --> 14:33.456
IT'LL TRAVEL

14:32.497 --> 14:33.456
TO NEW YORK,

14:33.498 --> 14:34.541
THEN L.A.,

14:34.582 --> 14:35.583
AND IT SHOULD,

14:34.582 --> 14:35.583
BECAUSE THERE ARE

14:35.625 --> 14:37.210
EXTRAORDINARY

14:35.625 --> 14:37.210
PEOPLE INVOLVED.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.171
ARE YOU REFERRING

14:37.251 --> 14:40.171
TO YOURSELF?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.466
AND A FEW OTHERS.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.468
SUCH AS THE PRIMA

14:43.508 --> 14:45.468
BALLERINA?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.930
SHE WAS PRETTY TERRIFIC.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.602
FRANCESCA

14:52.475 --> 14:54.602
WAS A BIG FAN

14:54.644 --> 14:57.397
OF THE PRIMA

14:54.644 --> 14:57.397
BALLERINA.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.398
I HAD SEX WITH HER,

14:58.439 --> 14:59.524
AND NOW MARINA'S

14:59.566 --> 15:01.025
PRETENDING

14:59.566 --> 15:01.025
TO BE JEALOUS.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.193
IT'S JUST THE WAY

15:01.067 --> 15:02.193
IT HAPPENED.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.986
THERE'S THIS WOMAN,

15:04.028 --> 15:06.072
SHE'S GETTING HER

15:04.028 --> 15:06.072
COSTUME FITTING,

15:06.113 --> 15:07.240
AND FRANCESCA

15:07.281 --> 15:10.493
PROCEEDED

15:07.281 --> 15:10.493
TO SEDUCE HER,

15:10.535 --> 15:12.912
WHICH I THINK IS

15:10.535 --> 15:12.912
A BIT UNETHICAL.

15:12.953 --> 15:16.165
YOU DO?

15:16.207 --> 15:17.584
DO YOU FIND THAT

15:16.207 --> 15:17.584
HARD TO BELIEVE?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.126
YEAH.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.378
"ETHICAL" ISN'T REALLY

15:20.420 --> 15:21.796
THE FIRST WORD

15:20.420 --> 15:21.796
THAT COMES TO MIND

15:21.838 --> 15:24.507
WHEN I THINK

15:21.838 --> 15:24.507
OF MARINA.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.009
YOU SOUND ANGRY.

15:27.051 --> 15:30.012
NO.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.348
WELL, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,

15:32.390 --> 15:33.433
AND THAT COMPENSATES

15:33.474 --> 15:34.434
FOR A MULTITUDE

15:33.474 --> 15:34.434
OF SINS,

15:34.475 --> 15:36.977
DOESN'T IT?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.605
COME ON.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.857
IT'S A COMPLIMENT TO BE

15:38.646 --> 15:40.857
THE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.443
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, JENNY?

15:43.484 --> 15:45.236
YES.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.490
HARRY? YOU ASSHOLE.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.700
I'M CALLING YOU

15:49.532 --> 15:50.700
TO SAY THANK YOU

15:50.742 --> 15:51.743
FOR BEGGING ME

15:50.742 --> 15:51.743
TO GO TO SHANE.

15:51.785 --> 15:52.952
SAY, "HELLO, HARRY."

15:52.993 --> 15:53.953
HELLO, HARRY.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.955
UH-HUH.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.292
NO, IT'S AMAZING.

15:55.996 --> 15:59.292
SHE'S A GENIUS.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.043
YEAH, FIRST OF ALL,

15:59.333 --> 16:01.043
FOR GIVING ME A GREAT HAIRCUT,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.337
AND SECOND OF ALL,

16:01.085 --> 16:03.337
FOR NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU,

16:03.379 --> 16:06.215
SO CALL ME WHEN YOU

16:03.379 --> 16:06.215
GET OUT OF YOUR "K" HOLE, OKAY?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.053
THANK YOU,

16:10.094 --> 16:11.053
MRS. JAFFE.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.054
GIVE THAT TO SHANE?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.055
SURE.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.056
I LOVE MY HAIR.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.183
GORGEOUS.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.686
AFTER YOU.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.686
SEE YOU AGAIN.

16:22.774 --> 16:23.733
SHANE...

16:23.775 --> 16:24.776
WHAT?

16:24.818 --> 16:27.361
MRS. JAFFE LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.196
COOL.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.157
200 BUCKS. NICE WORK.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.867
DON'T FORGET

16:31.198 --> 16:32.867
TO SWEEP UP.

16:39.206 --> 16:41.041
DON'T DO THAT.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.420
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

16:42.877 --> 16:44.420
HOW DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN

16:44.462 --> 16:46.255
TO GET YOU OUT OF MY MIND.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.223
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

16:56.265 --> 16:57.642
BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTING

16:57.684 --> 17:00.019
LIKE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

16:57.684 --> 17:00.019
WITH FEELINGS.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.521
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE

17:00.060 --> 17:01.521
YOU ACT SO COLD.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.522
IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW

17:01.562 --> 17:02.522
THAT YOU HAVE ANY.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.857
IF YOU'RE SO ANGRY,

17:03.898 --> 17:04.858
WHY DID YOU

17:03.898 --> 17:04.858
ACCEPT THIS INVITATION?

17:04.899 --> 17:05.900
BECAUSE I WANTED

ANYONE OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH?

42:32.300 --> 42:33.801
WELL, IT'S RELEVANT

NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES

42:43.728 --> 42:45.438
THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN

42:43.728 --> 42:45.438

A DARKER PLACE

43:03.748 --> 43:05.375
FOR YOUR CHILD

43:03.748 --> 43:05.375
TO LIVE IN.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.919
MS. PORTER,

43:07.960 --> 43:10.838
DO YOU THINK THE FACT

43:07.960 --> 43:10.838
THAT YOU'RE HOMOSEXUAL

43:10.880 --> 43:13.383
MAKES YOU MORALLY BANKRUPT?

43:13.425 --> 43:15.051
BY YOUR DEFINITION,

43:13.425 --> 43:15.051
I'M A PERVERT,

43:15.093 --> 43:16.469
SINCE REALLY,

43:15.093 --> 43:16.469

43:16.511 --> 43:20.014
IS ONLY A PERVERT

43:16.511 --> 43:20.014

43:23.893 --> 43:25.895
