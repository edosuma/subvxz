00:04.738 --> 00:06.374
PREVIOUSLY ON LOVE & HIP-HOP:

00:06.374 --> 00:07.075
ATLANTA...

00:07.075 --> 00:08.676
THIS LOOKS WAY OVER BUDGET.

00:08.676 --> 00:09.843
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:09.843 --> 00:11.011
BECAUSE YOU'RE WRITING MONEY

00:11.011 --> 00:11.679
OUT OF MY CHECKBOOK.

00:11.679 --> 00:12.346
GUESS WHAT.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.514
IT DON'T MATTER. BYE.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.782
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S GAY.

00:14.782 --> 00:15.749
HIS FRIEND'S GAY.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.684
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:16.684 --> 00:17.451
A [bleep] MAN.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.286
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.220
SO LET'S BE CLEAR.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.223
AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ONE.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.124
YOU DID GREAT.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.292
I MEAN, PEOPLE--YOU WALKED OUT,

00:24.292 --> 00:25.693
AND THEY WAS LIKE, "AH!"

00:25.693 --> 00:26.360
[laughs]

00:26.360 --> 00:27.027
WELL, I DO MY THANG.

00:27.027 --> 00:27.861
SO YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

00:27.861 --> 00:28.762
YOU WERE CONSIDERED JUST

00:28.762 --> 00:30.331
THE BABY MAMAS, AND THAT'S IT.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.965
I SAY, "[bleep] YOU WITH A LONG

00:31.965 --> 00:33.667
STICK," AND KEEP IT MOVING.

00:33.667 --> 00:34.768
WE DON'T HAVE NO DEAL.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.536
WHAT YOU MEAN WE AIN'T GOT

00:35.536 --> 00:36.337
NO DEAL?

00:36.337 --> 00:38.139
WE DO NOT HAVE A DEAL.

00:38.139 --> 00:38.806
YOU'RE A BITCH.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.473
WE FINISHED?

00:39.473 --> 00:40.341
THE BITCHINESS IS COMING OUT

00:40.341 --> 00:41.008
OF YOU.

00:41.008 --> 00:41.775
I'LL BE A BITCH AND LEAVE.

00:41.775 --> 00:42.443
THAT'S GOOD.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.111
GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE.

00:43.111 --> 00:43.777
BITCH.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.279
BYE.

00:45.279 --> 00:45.946

00:45.946 --> 00:46.847

00:46.847 --> 00:47.715
YEAH.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.382

00:48.382 --> 00:49.383
THIS SHOULD BE MINE WITH NO

00:49.383 --> 00:50.151
STRINGS ATTACHED.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.051
YEAH, NO--NO STRINGS.

00:51.051 --> 00:51.719
YOU'RE DAMAGED.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.386
I SOUND DAMAGED?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.087
YOU SOUND LIKE

00:53.087 --> 00:53.754
A DERANGED WOMAN.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.422

00:54.422 --> 00:55.089

WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

01:41.869 --> 01:43.471
I WAS STILL TRYING TO WRAP MY

01:43.471 --> 01:44.972
MIND AROUND WHAT HAPPENED AT

01:44.972 --> 01:46.674
NIKKO'S VIDEO RELEASE PARTY

01:46.674 --> 01:48.276
WHEN KARLIE HIT ME WITH A TEXT

01:48.276 --> 01:50.344
MESSAGE SAYING WE NEED TO TALK.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.545
I KNOW IN THE PAST HOW WE--

01:51.545 --> 01:52.546
THINGS HAVE BEEN...

01:52.546 --> 01:53.781
CRAZY WITH US.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.183
AND I WANTED TO BE STRAIGHT UP

01:55.183 --> 01:56.450
WITH YOU AND COME TO YOU FIRST

01:56.450 --> 01:57.285
AND BE LIKE, "OKAY, LOOK,"

01:57.285 --> 01:58.452
AND SHOW YOU--

01:58.452 --> 02:00.321
WHAT IS GOING ON?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.655
LET'S BE CLEAR.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.491
KARLIE REDD IS VERY MESSY,

02:03.491 --> 02:05.193
BUT SHE GAVE ME SOME ACCURATE

02:05.193 --> 02:06.494
INFORMATION LAST YEAR ABOUT

02:06.494 --> 02:08.196
STEVIE AND JOSELINE, SO WHEN SHE

02:08.196 --> 02:10.964
CALLED ME THIS TIME ABOUT NIKKO,

02:10.964 --> 02:12.200
I FIGURED, "LET ME JUST HEAR

02:12.200 --> 02:12.933
WHAT THE [bleep] SHE GOT

02:12.933 --> 02:14.067
TO SAY."

02:14.067 --> 02:15.603
GIRL, OKAY.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.271
SO I'M IN THE CLUB WITH MY

02:17.271 --> 02:19.607
GIRLS, AND I SEE NIKKO FROM

02:19.607 --> 02:20.908
ACROSS THE ROOM, SO I'M LIKE,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.009
"HEY," YOU KNOW?

02:22.009 --> 02:23.211
I'M THINKING EVERYTHING'S COOL.

02:23.211 --> 02:24.044
"WHAT'S UP?"

02:24.044 --> 02:25.479
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, MY GIRL

02:25.479 --> 02:27.315
CALLED ME LIKE, "OH, NIKKO

02:27.315 --> 02:28.015
LOOKING FOR YOU."

02:28.015 --> 02:28.916
I'M LIKE, "WHY?"

02:28.916 --> 02:29.617
"HE SAID HE DON'T KNOW

02:29.617 --> 02:30.451
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MIMI.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.119
SHE BACK ON THE STEVIE BUS."

02:32.119 --> 02:33.053
JUST ALL SORTS OF CRAZY

02:33.053 --> 02:33.754
INFORMATION.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.589
I'M LIKE, "OKAY, I DON'T NEED

02:35.589 --> 02:36.557
TO HEAR ALL THAT."

02:36.557 --> 02:39.393
THEN HE EVEN HIT MY EX,

02:39.393 --> 02:40.628
TALKING ABOUT...

02:40.628 --> 02:42.430
YOU GONNA BE LIKE, "SHUT UP."

02:42.430 --> 02:43.631
LOOK.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.132
"NIKKO ASKED FOR YOUR NUMBER.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.467
DIDN'T GIVE IT TO HIM.

02:46.467 --> 02:47.635
HERE IS HIS IF YOU WANT TO

02:47.635 --> 02:48.669
CALL HIM."

02:48.669 --> 02:50.471
AND THAT'S HIS NUMBER, RIGHT?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.240
THAT WOULD BE HIS NUMBER.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.507
WELL, THERE IT IS

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
RIGHT ON HER PHONE:

02:54.675 --> 02:56.310
NIKKO'S INFORMATION.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.645
GUESS SHE WASN'T SO MESSY

02:57.645 --> 02:58.579
AFTER ALL.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.580
AT LEAST I DIDN'T INVEST

02:59.580 --> 03:01.315
ALL THIS TIME INTO NIKKO

03:01.315 --> 03:02.483
BEFORE FINDING OUT WHAT KIND OF

03:02.483 --> 03:04.117
GUY HE REALLY IS.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.253
WHAT IS GOING ON?

03:05.253 --> 03:08.456
GIRL, WE HAD A RELEASE PARTY

03:08.456 --> 03:10.391
FOR HIS VIDEO THAT I WAS IN.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.659
MM-HMM.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.061
IT GOT OUT OF HAND.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.264
GIRL, NIKKO--HE STARTS CALLING

03:16.264 --> 03:18.999
ME DAMAGED GOODS, AND, YOU KNOW,

03:18.999 --> 03:20.868
I'VE KNOWN NIKKO FOR YEARS, BUT

03:20.868 --> 03:24.037
THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON NOW...

03:24.037 --> 03:25.539

YOU HEAR ME?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.446
AND WE JUST GONNA WORK HARDER,

05:12.446 --> 05:15.849
RIGHT?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.117
I KNOW I REALLY BE FRONTING

05:17.117 --> 05:19.119
A LOT, AND I'M ALWAYS SUCH

05:19.119 --> 05:20.087
A TOUGH GIRL.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.755
BUT THE TRUTH REALLY IS, THE

05:21.755 --> 05:23.256
LAST TWO WEEKS WITHOUT STEVIE,

05:23.256 --> 05:24.625
IT'S REALLY BEEN HARD FOR ME.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.460
I CAN DO MY MUSIC AND EVERYTHING

05:26.460 --> 05:27.461
ELSE WITHOUT HIM, BUT I REALLY

05:27.461 --> 05:28.862
DON'T WANT TO DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.197
THE ONLY THING I WANT US TO DO

05:30.197 --> 05:31.532
IS TO STAY FOCUSED, STEVIE,

05:31.532 --> 05:33.401
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEAL,

05:33.401 --> 05:34.134
NOW WHAT THE [bleep]

05:34.134 --> 05:34.802
WE GONNA DO?

05:34.802 --> 05:37.405
WE GOT TO REALLY, REALLY WORK.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.105
WELL, I STILL WANT IT TO

05:38.105 --> 05:40.441
HAPPEN, BUT RIGHT NOW, NOBODY'S

05:40.441 --> 05:41.509
KNOCKING DOWN OUR DOOR FOR

05:41.509 --> 05:43.010
THE PUERTO RICAN PRINCESS.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.177
WE GOT TO GO THE INDEPENDENT

05:44.177 --> 05:45.178
ROUTE.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.014
KNOW WHAT THAT MEAN, RIGHT?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.416
WE DON'T HAVE A MAJOR BACKING

05:48.416 --> 05:49.583
US; WE GOT TO PAY FOR OUR OWN

05:49.583 --> 05:51.585
VIDEOS, PAY FOR EVERYTHING ON

05:51.585 --> 05:52.853
OUR OWN POCKET.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.822
STEVIE, I DO A LOT OF

05:54.822 --> 05:55.489
WALK-THROUGHS.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.024
I MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

05:57.024 --> 05:57.725
YOU KNOW THIS.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.992
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I MAKE.

05:58.992 --> 05:59.660
YOU KNOW EVERY DOLLAR

05:59.660 --> 06:00.561
THAT I MAKE.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.462
WHO COULD MAKE THIS HAPPEN

06:01.462 --> 06:02.663
WITHOUT NOBODY HELPING THEM?

06:02.663 --> 06:03.831
I DON'T CARE WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE

06:03.831 --> 06:04.998
IN ME AS LONG AS YOU AND I

06:04.998 --> 06:07.668
BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.669
BUT YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, AND I'M

11:52.579 --> 11:53.380
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.548
IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT WHEN YOU

11:59.386 --> 12:01.421

12:01.421 --> 12:02.255
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED

12:02.255 --> 12:02.923

12:04.124 --> 12:05.592

13:18.165 --> 13:18.866
[laughs]

13:18.866 --> 13:20.200
HEY, WAIT, THAT'S A SMILE.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.202
BUT THAT WASN'T NO, LIKE, SMILE.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.203
THAT WAS ON SOME, LIKE,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.005
"BITCH, I'M GETTING IT IN.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.039

13:26.039 --> 13:26.773
OKAY, YOU REMEMBER WHEN

13:26.773 --> 13:27.640
YOU WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, YOU HAD

13:27.640 --> 13:28.942
A CRUSH ON SOMEBODY?

13:28.942 --> 13:29.877
WELL, I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON

13:29.877 --> 13:30.878
SOMEBODY FOR A WHILE--

13:30.878 --> 13:31.611
LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS--

13:31.611 --> 13:32.779
BUT WE'VE JUST BEEN FRIENDS,

13:32.779 --> 13:36.783
BUT HE FINALLY ASKED ME OUT.

13:36.783 --> 13:37.951
YES, I'M ABOUT TO START DATING

13:37.951 --> 13:39.286
AGAIN, AND I'M REALLY EXCITED,

13:39.286 --> 13:40.353
BUT, YOU KNOW, A WOMAN COULD

13:40.353 --> 13:41.521
ALWAYS USE A DAY AT THE BEAUTY

13:41.521 --> 13:43.056
SALON BEFORE HER FIRST DATE.

13:43.056 --> 13:43.891
SO IF KARLIE'S OFFERING,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.458
WHO AM I TO SAY NO, RIGHT?

13:45.458 --> 13:46.293
I'VE SEEN HIM IN THE GYM, AND

13:46.293 --> 13:47.460
WE'LL TALK, AND WE'LL LAUGH AND

13:47.460 --> 13:48.795
JUST KIND OF FLIRT A LITTLE BIT

13:48.795 --> 13:49.796
BUT KEEP IT MOVING.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.031
AND THEN HE FINALLY--

13:51.031 --> 13:52.632
IS HE FINE?

13:52.632 --> 13:53.600
HE'S--YOU KNOW, HE CUTE.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.068
[laughs]

13:55.068 --> 13:55.735
HE'S CUTE.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.405
BUT IS HE FINE?

13:58.405 --> 13:59.907
I HATE TALKING TO YOU.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.474
SO I'M EXCITED.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.809
AND IT FEELS SO--

14:02.809 --> 14:03.643
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T FELT THIS

14:03.643 --> 14:04.411
FEELING IN A LONG TIME.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.078

14:05.913 --> 14:07.948

14:07.948 --> 14:08.916
I THINK IT'S TOO SOON

14:08.916 --> 14:09.616

14:09.616 --> 14:10.283
I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE,

14:10.283 --> 14:11.051
BRAND-SPANKING-NEW.

14:11.051 --> 14:11.985
THIS IS GONNA BE OUR FIRST DATE.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.652
SO? I MEAN...

14:12.652 --> 14:13.987
WELL, YOU PROBABLY WILL MEET

14:13.987 --> 14:15.188
HIM EVENTUALLY, BUT FOR RIGHT

14:15.188 --> 14:16.123
NOW, I'LL INVITE

14:16.123 --> 14:16.789
A COUPLE PEOPLE.

14:16.789 --> 14:17.457

14:17.457 --> 14:18.191

14:19.526 --> 14:20.227

14:21.061 --> 14:23.163

14:26.633 --> 14:27.534
[laughs]

14:27.534 --> 14:29.502
CUT THE CHECK, BOO.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.504
[laughter]

14:39.246 --> 14:41.014
THERE COMES A TIME IN

14:41.014 --> 14:44.251
A RELATIONSHIP, IN A BUSINESS

14:44.251 --> 14:45.718
RELATIONSHIP, IN A MARRIAGE,

14:45.718 --> 14:47.054
WHERE YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO

14:47.054 --> 14:49.189
WORK OUT, BUT YOU GOT TO

14:49.189 --> 14:50.257
SEPARATE IT.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.159
AND RIGHT NOW, I'M AT A POINT OF

14:52.159 --> 14:53.760
WANTING TO SEPARATE THAT.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.595
KIRK AND I, WE NOT SEEING

14:55.595 --> 14:56.663
EYE TO EYE.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.998
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME KIRK

14:57.998 --> 14:59.732
AND I HAVE ARGUED OVER BUSINESS.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.968
THIS ALSO AIN'T THE FIRST TIME

15:00.968 --> 15:01.969
I DONE CAME TO DEB,

15:01.969 --> 15:03.136
WHO'S A WELL-KNOWN MANAGER IN

15:03.136 --> 15:04.972
THE "A," ASKING FOR HELP.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.239
LAST YEAR, I LET IT GO AND KEPT

15:06.239 --> 15:07.574
KIRK RUNNING THE BUSINESS, BUT

15:07.574 --> 15:09.309
THIS TIME, HMM, I'M MAKING MY

15:09.309 --> 15:11.778
OWN MOVES, DOING MY OWN THING.

15:11.778 --> 15:15.682
SO RASHEEDA FEELS THAT WAY.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.984
HOW DOES KIRK FEEL?

15:16.984 --> 15:17.617
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:17.617 --> 15:18.851
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW HE FEELS,

15:18.851 --> 15:20.120
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.989
I AM AN ARTIST, AND I HAVE THE

15:21.989 --> 15:24.124
RIGHT TO BE MANAGED BY WHO

15:24.124 --> 15:25.558
I WANT TO BE MANAGED BY.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.060
HE'S NOT PLAYING THE MANAGEMENT

15:27.060 --> 15:28.395
ROLE RIGHT NOW, AND I DON'T

15:28.395 --> 15:29.062
DESERVE THAT.

15:29.062 --> 15:29.896
I'M GRINDING.

15:29.896 --> 15:30.597
I'M WORKING HARD.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.599
I JUST DID A PHOTO SHOOT FOR THE

15:32.599 --> 15:34.601
SINGLES THAT I WANT TO RELEASE.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.768
IT'S BOSS CHICK MUSIC.

15:35.768 --> 15:36.769
I'MA GIVE YOU YOUR COPIES

15:36.769 --> 15:38.271
WHILE WE TALKING.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.007
THE SONG THAT I WANT TO SHOOT

15:40.007 --> 15:40.907
THE VIDEO FOR IS CALLED

15:40.907 --> 15:42.742
HIT IT FROM THE BACK.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.611
SO I'M MOVING FORWARD, HANDLING

15:44.611 --> 15:46.113
MY BUSINESS ALL MYSELF.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.915
BUT IT CAN'T BE AN "I"

15:48.915 --> 15:50.050
STATEMENT.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.019
WELL, I HAVE TO SPEAK IN "I"

15:52.019 --> 15:53.120
TO YOU BECAUSE I AM DOING IT,

15:53.120 --> 15:54.154
BECAUSE HE'S NOT.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.355
SO THE ONLY PERSON DOING IT--

15:55.355 --> 15:56.456
IS HE DOING IT BECAUSE HE'S

15:56.456 --> 15:57.557
ANGRY RIGHT NOW?

15:57.557 --> 15:59.826
IS HE DOING IT BECAUSE OF...

15:59.826 --> 16:01.261
OKAY, THERE'S ONE THING THAT

16:01.261 --> 16:02.595
I HAVE TO THROW INTO THE LOOP

16:02.595 --> 16:06.333
RIGHT NOW IS, I'M EXPECTING.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.568
AND I KNOW IT'S NOT THE BEST

16:08.568 --> 16:10.037
THING FOR AN ARTIST.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.471
[laughs]

16:11.471 --> 16:12.372
AND THAT WAS ONE THING

16:12.372 --> 16:13.673
THAT I WAS...

16:13.673 --> 16:15.508
GRITTING MY TEETH ON ON THE WAY

16:15.508 --> 16:17.077
OVER HERE TO TELL YOU.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.611
AND HOW FAR GONE ARE YOU?

16:18.611 --> 16:21.881
UM, I'M ALMOST FOUR MONTHS.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.216
JESUS.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.318
SO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I--

16:25.318 --> 16:26.353
OKAY, THIS IS THE THING.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.754
AND I FEEL LIKE WITH THE

16:27.754 --> 16:29.456
PREGNANCY, NOW IS THE TIME WHERE

16:29.456 --> 16:30.857
PEOPLE ARE EMBRACING THAT.

16:30.857 --> 16:31.958
EMBRACING WHAT?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.726
PEOPLE EMBRACE A WOMAN BEING

16:33.726 --> 16:34.927
PREGNANT IN THE INDUSTRY.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.896
WHO EMBRACES?

16:36.896 --> 16:37.830
WHEN BE--OKAY, LET ME--

16:37.830 --> 16:39.366
BUT BEYONCE--HOLD ON, NOW.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.667
NO, NO, NO, BEYONCE IS

16:40.667 --> 16:41.368
BEYONCE.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.135
LET'S NEVER GET THAT

16:42.135 --> 16:42.802
[bleep] TWISTED.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.237
YEAH, WE CAN'T GO THERE NOW.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.972
BUT I'M GONNA SAY, AT THE END

16:45.972 --> 16:47.907
OF THE DAY, I DON'T FEEL LIKE

16:47.907 --> 16:49.409
IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN'T

16:49.409 --> 16:50.410
BE DONE.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.844
PEOPLE ALWAYS WANT TO THROW

16:51.844 --> 16:53.680
THAT [bleep] IN, LIKE, "OH, NOW

16:53.680 --> 16:55.082
SHE'S HANDICAPPED.

16:55.082 --> 16:56.083
SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:56.083 --> 16:56.916
A PREGNANT ARTIST--

16:56.916 --> 16:57.817
OH, MY GOD."

16:57.817 --> 16:58.851
AND THERE'S TONS OF ARTISTS WHO

16:58.851 --> 17:01.121
GET PREGNANT AND DO A WHOLE LOT

17:01.121 --> 17:01.988
OF THINGS DURING THEIR

17:01.988 --> 17:03.490
PREGNANCY, AND I WANT TO BE ONE

17:03.490 --> 17:05.658
OF THOSE TYPE OF ARTISTS.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.829
SO I'M GONNA COME IN WITH

17:09.829 --> 17:11.098
YOU, RIGHT?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.700
AND WE COULD DO SOME, LIKE...

17:13.700 --> 17:15.202
TEMPORARY THING JUST TO SEE IF

17:15.202 --> 17:17.370
IT WORKS, BECAUSE A PART OF ME

17:17.370 --> 17:18.838
DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S GONNA WORK.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.173
WELL, DEB, SEE, WHY YOU GONNA

17:20.173 --> 17:21.141
THROW SOMETHING BAD

17:21.141 --> 17:21.808
OUT IN THE AIR?

17:21.808 --> 17:22.909
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE

17:22.909 --> 17:24.844
ABOUT IT, BUT THIS IS THE THING:

17:24.844 --> 17:26.346
RASHEEDA'S A MOTHER NOW.

17:26.346 --> 17:30.117
THIS COULD TAKE THE SECOND SEAT.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.718
BUT I WOULD FOCUS MORE SO

17:31.718 --> 17:33.120
ON THE ENDORSEMENTS.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.287
THAT'S YOUR REAL MONEY ANYWAY,

17:34.287 --> 17:34.987
OKAY?

17:34.987 --> 17:35.822
BEING ENDORSED, BEING ON

17:35.822 --> 17:37.157
THE FRONT COVERS OF MAGAZINES,

17:37.157 --> 17:38.458
DOING ALL THESE KIND OF THINGS.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.993
FASHION, HAIR, SUPER BIG, OKAY?

17:40.993 --> 17:42.229
YOU COULD STILL MAKE YOUR

17:42.229 --> 17:42.995
MARKER.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.331
YOU COULD STILL DO WHAT IT IS

17:44.331 --> 17:45.898
THAT YOU NEED TO DO.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.900
BUT IT'S MORE MONEY ON THAT SIDE

17:47.900 --> 17:50.270
THAN IT IS ON THIS SIDE.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.307
IF I'M DJ'ING AT THE CLUB,

17:54.307 --> 17:55.875
IS IT, LIKE, EIGHT CHICKS IN

17:55.875 --> 17:56.909
THE CLUB YOU [bleep]?

17:56.909 --> 17:57.910
NOPE.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.146
IT MAY BE, LIKE, TWO OR THREE.

17:59.146 --> 17:59.879
[laughs]

17:59.879 --> 18:01.148
WHEN WE FIND OUT THAT THERE'S

25:28.360 --> 25:29.361
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND, LIKE,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.697
AS A BACHELOR IN ATLANTA, YOU

25:30.697 --> 25:31.998
KNOW, WE'RE A MINORITY HERE.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.432
SO WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE, YOU KNOW,

25:33.432 --> 25:34.200
HE'S GONNA HAVE HIS CAKE

25:34.200 --> 25:34.934
AND EAT IT TOO.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.602
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU

25:35.602 --> 25:36.268
WERE DOING?

25:36.268 --> 25:37.103
NAH, I WAS DOING IT, BUT,

25:37.103 --> 25:38.270
LIKE, WHEN I WAS COMMITTED,

25:38.270 --> 25:39.639
I WAS COMMITTED.

25:39.639 --> 25:40.607
BUT THEN WHEN I GOT--WHEN I

25:40.607 --> 25:42.041
WAS COMMITTED, THEN I STARTED,

25:42.041 --> 25:42.709
YOU KNOW...

25:42.709 --> 25:43.375
[laughs]

25:43.375 --> 25:44.110
I STARTED TO JUST LOSE

25:44.110 --> 25:45.812
INTEREST, THEN I JUST DID WHAT I

25:45.812 --> 25:47.146
DID, BUT I MANNED UP AND PULLED

25:47.146 --> 25:48.314
MYSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION,

25:48.314 --> 25:49.215
'CAUSE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ME

25:49.215 --> 25:50.116
TO DRAG HER ALONG.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.483
OH, YOU WERE CHEATING.

25:51.483 --> 25:52.384
YOU'RE A CHEATER.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.385
NO, I'M NOT A CHEATER.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.854
I CHEATED--E-D.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.222
RIGHT, WHAT THEY SAY?

25:56.222 --> 25:56.889
"ONCE A CHEATER,

25:56.889 --> 25:57.624
ALWAYS A CHEATER"?

25:57.624 --> 25:58.390
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.726
YOU KNOW, THEY GOT REHAB AND,

25:59.726 --> 26:01.628
YOU KNOW, SESSIONS AND CLASSES.

26:01.628 --> 26:02.228
EXCUSE ME?

26:02.228 --> 26:02.962
[laughs]

26:02.962 --> 26:03.630
OH, MY GOD.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.530
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.431
I THOUGHT I WAS OLD, BUT I WAS

26:05.431 --> 26:06.733
STILL YOUNG-MINDED.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.100
BUT LEARNING FROM MY MISTAKES,

26:08.100 --> 26:09.101
AND THEN DEFINITELY WITH MY KIDS

26:09.101 --> 26:10.637
GETTING OLDER, I JUST REALIZED

26:10.637 --> 26:12.271
IT WAS TIME TO DO A 360 CHANGE.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.840
SO ALL I CAN DO NOW IS JUST

26:13.840 --> 26:15.007
BETTER MYSELF FOR THE NEXT.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.308
THERE WERE DEFINITELY A FEW

26:16.308 --> 26:18.177
RED FLAGS DURING THE DATE, BUT

26:18.177 --> 26:19.646
THE BIGGER PICTURE IS, HE WAS SO

26:19.646 --> 26:20.647
SWEET, AND HE WAS SO KIND,

26:20.647 --> 26:22.481
AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT ME IN EVERY

26:22.481 --> 26:23.750
ASPECT, SO I WANT TO KEEP IT

26:23.750 --> 26:25.051
GOING.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.385
I'M GLAD THAT THIS FINALLY

26:26.385 --> 26:27.053
HAPPENED.

26:27.053 --> 26:27.720
YEAH.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.420
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS IN

26:28.420 --> 26:29.288
A LONG TIME, SO...

26:29.288 --> 26:30.522
WHAT'S A LONG TIME?

26:30.522 --> 26:31.858
A LONG TIME.

26:31.858 --> 26:32.859
TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS,

26:32.859 --> 26:33.926
FOUR YEARS...

26:33.926 --> 26:35.695
I'M SO ABOUT MY BUSINESS,

26:35.695 --> 26:37.196
AND I MIGHT HAVE SOME TRUST

26:37.196 --> 26:37.964
ISSUES--

26:37.964 --> 26:39.565
JUST VERY LITTLE.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.100
MY SON'S FATHER CHEATED ON ME,

26:41.100 --> 26:42.769
AND I WAS PREGNANT AT THE TIME,

26:42.769 --> 26:46.305
SO IT WAS DEVASTATING.

26:46.305 --> 26:48.675
I WANT TO TRUST AGAIN, AND I

26:48.675 --> 26:50.409
THINK THAT THE RIGHT MAN WILL

26:50.409 --> 26:51.443
BRING THAT OUT OF ME.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.311
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO

26:52.311 --> 26:52.979
BE GAINED AND SHOWN

26:52.979 --> 26:53.680
AT THE SAME TIME.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.381
I AGREE.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.248
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE

26:56.248 --> 26:57.483
HONEST WITH YOU AND BE UP FRONT

26:57.483 --> 26:58.685
WITH YOU ABOUT EVERYTHING...

26:58.685 --> 26:59.285
RIGHT.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.419

27:01.420 --> 27:02.755
YOU KNOW, I CAN--LIKE I SAID,

27:02.755 --> 27:03.489
JUST PRAY ABOUT IT.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.124
I WAS GONNA DO, AND I'M MOVING

31:32.124 --> 31:33.425
FORWARD WITH MY CAREER.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.594
BUT WHAT I WASN'T EXPECTING IS

31:35.594 --> 31:37.196
FOR KIRK TO WALK HIS MONKEY ASS

31:37.196 --> 31:39.865
IN THE VIDEO.

31:39.865 --> 31:40.766
HEY, KIRK.

31:40.766 --> 31:41.833
HOW ARE YOU?

31:41.833 --> 31:43.335
I'M NOT ON MY BEST PAGE

31:43.335 --> 31:45.071
TODAY.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.205
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

31:46.205 --> 31:47.139
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT I'M

31:47.139 --> 31:47.839
DOING HERE?

31:47.839 --> 31:50.042
I TOLD YOU--DON'T TOUCH THE

31:50.042 --> 31:51.377
BUSINESS ACCOUNT TO DO THINGS

31:51.377 --> 31:52.644
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

31:52.644 --> 31:53.845
RASHEEDA'S DEFINITELY GOING

31:53.845 --> 31:55.014
THROUGH SOMETHING HERSELF TO BE

31:55.014 --> 31:56.748
SHOOTING A VIDEO RIGHT NOW WITH

31:56.748 --> 31:57.984
A BELLY LIKE YOU GOT.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.085
AND I'M JUST TIRED OF HER TAKING

31:59.085 --> 32:01.353
IT UPON HERSELF TO DO THINGS

32:01.353 --> 32:02.621
'CAUSE SHE'S THE ARTIST.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.756
I'M JUST REALLY READY TO

32:04.756 --> 32:06.725
STRANGLE HER ASS, BUT I DIDN'T.

32:06.725 --> 32:07.893
IF THIS WAS ANOTHER ARTIST,

32:07.893 --> 32:08.995
WOULD THEY BE SHOOTING A VIDEO

32:08.995 --> 32:09.861
RIGHT NOW AT THIS STAGE

32:09.861 --> 32:10.529
THAT YOU'RE IN?

32:10.529 --> 32:11.397
I CAN'T SPEAK ON NOBODY BUT

32:11.397 --> 32:12.064
RASHEEDA.

32:12.064 --> 32:12.831
BUT YOU COULD HAVE PUT THE

32:12.831 --> 32:14.233
TIMING ON IT A LOT BETTER.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.301
BESIDE YOU TOUCHING STUFF--

32:15.301 --> 32:16.835
KIRK, DON'T TELL ME NOTHING

32:16.835 --> 32:17.736
ABOUT TIMING.

32:17.736 --> 32:18.470
I WAS WAITING--

32:18.470 --> 32:19.205
SO THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.072
I WAS WAITING FOR A MINUTE...

32:20.072 --> 32:20.739
THAT'S YOUR MISTAKE.

32:20.739 --> 32:21.540
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE--

32:21.540 --> 32:22.441
SO BLAME THAT [bleep] ON YOU.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.609
NO, WHAT I'M BLAMING IT ON

32:23.609 --> 32:25.011
IS YOU BEING a [bleep]-UP

32:25.011 --> 32:26.112
ASS [bleep] AND NOT DOING

32:26.112 --> 32:27.346
WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO AS

32:27.346 --> 32:29.115
A BUSINESSMAN AND AS A FATHER.

32:29.115 --> 32:30.282
IT [bleep] PISSES ME OFF.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.783
SO--SO YOU THINK WHAT YOU

32:31.783 --> 32:32.618
WANT TO THINK.

32:32.618 --> 32:33.719
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO,

32:33.719 --> 32:34.820
BUT I'MA TELL YOU WHAT.

32:34.820 --> 32:35.821
YOUR NAME WILL BE COMING OFF

32:35.821 --> 32:36.555
THAT ACCOUNT...

32:36.555 --> 32:37.223
OKAY.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.057
TOMORROW, PERIOD.

32:38.057 --> 32:38.890
OKAY, SO GUESS WHAT.

32:38.890 --> 32:39.625
AND THAT'S JUST THAT.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.792
SO LET ME GO DOWN MY LINE.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.028
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT

32:42.028 --> 32:42.694
WHAT YOU SAY.

32:42.694 --> 32:43.395
I DON'T CARE ABOUT NONE OF

32:43.395 --> 32:44.063
THE BANK ACCOUNT.

32:44.063 --> 32:44.730
YOU KNOW WHY?

32:44.730 --> 32:45.597
BECAUSE I'M ENTITLED TO

32:45.597 --> 32:46.265
THE MONEY TOO.

32:46.265 --> 32:47.433
YOU COULD ASK A JUDGE ABOUT THAT

32:47.433 --> 32:48.200
IF YOU WANT TO.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.035
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.036
IT MEANS EXACTLY WHAT IT

32:50.036 --> 32:50.869
SOUNDS LIKE.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.371
I'M HOLDING IT DOWN, TRYING TO

32:52.371 --> 32:53.539
MAKE DECISIONS FOR THE BUSINESS.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.473
THEN YOU WANT TO COME AT ME

32:54.473 --> 32:55.707
SIDEWAYS WITH SOME BULL[bleep],

32:55.707 --> 32:56.708
WHEN YOU THE ONE WHO BEEN OUT

32:56.708 --> 32:58.210

32:58.210 --> 32:59.378
IN THE MORNING, AND I DON'T EVEN

32:59.378 --> 33:00.379
QUESTION YOUR ASS, 'CAUSE

33:00.379 --> 33:01.113
RIGHT NOW, I DON'T EVEN

33:01.113 --> 33:02.414
GIVE A [bleep].

33:02.414 --> 33:03.382
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.383
SAVE THAT [bleep] FOR

33:04.383 --> 33:05.184
SOMEBODY ELSE.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.053
YOU GET ON YOUR GODDAMN BIKE,

33:07.053 --> 33:07.919
AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU

33:07.919 --> 33:09.055
WANT TO DO AT 2:00 AND 3:00

33:09.055 --> 33:10.189
AND 4:00 IN THE MORNING,

33:10.189 --> 33:11.857
BECAUSE I'M DONE.

33:11.857 --> 33:12.791
THIS [bleep] NOT MAKING A LOT

33:12.791 --> 33:13.625
OF SENSE, RASHEEDA.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.360
I'M DONE WITH IT.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.527
YOU KNOW WHAT DON'T MAKE SENSE?

33:15.527 --> 33:17.896
ME AND YOU DON'T MAKE SENSE.

33:17.896 --> 33:18.564
YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:18.564 --> 33:20.066
BECAUSE YOU ON ONE PAGE, AND I'M

33:20.066 --> 33:21.167
ON ANOTHER PAGE, AND UNTIL WE

33:21.167 --> 33:21.900

33:21.900 --> 33:22.734
SO, GREAT, YOU'RE MAKING IT

33:22.734 --> 33:23.402
EVEN CLEARER.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.503
SO WE DON'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

33:24.503 --> 33:25.171
NO, WE DON'T.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.372
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.106
LIKE, COOL.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.240
YOU DO YOU; I DO ME.

33:28.240 --> 33:28.907
YUP.

33:28.907 --> 33:29.575
GREAT.

33:29.575 --> 33:30.242
GOOD.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.477
DEB, I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING

33:31.477 --> 33:34.480
YOUR DAY.

33:34.480 --> 33:35.147
YEAH, BYE.

33:35.147 --> 33:35.814
HAVE FUN WITH IT.

33:35.814 --> 33:36.948
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA GET

33:36.948 --> 33:37.616
BACK TO WORK.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.285
WHAT, SO I LOOK LIKE A BIG GIRL?

33:39.285 --> 33:40.552
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE WHAT

33:40.552 --> 33:41.887
ALL OF US OUT HERE SEE.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.322
IT'S HORRIBLE.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.423
ERICA.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.891
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

33:45.891 --> 33:46.558
GRAB THAT.

33:46.558 --> 33:47.393
WHAT THE [bleep] YOU GONNA DO,

33:47.393 --> 33:49.395
BITCH?

33:55.901 --> 33:56.635
LET'S GET THIS STRAIGHT

33:56.635 --> 33:58.270
OVER HERE.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.105
FOR ONCE, I'M NOT GONNA

33:59.105 --> 34:00.306
REALLY DISAGREE WITH THE MAN.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.573
YOU LOOK HUGE.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.674
YOU LOOK 15 MONTHS PREGNANT.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.110
WELL, TIME--[bleep] HAPPENS,

34:04.110 --> 34:04.976
AND I'M SITTING HERE TRYING TO

34:04.976 --> 34:05.877
MAKE [bleep] WORK, AND IT AIN'T

34:05.877 --> 34:06.645
EASY, BUT I'M TRYING TO DO--

34:06.645 --> 34:07.313
BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW

34:07.313 --> 34:08.013
SOMETHING?

34:08.013 --> 34:09.014
IF YOU COME--IF YOU COME TO

34:09.014 --> 34:10.816
SOMEBODY AND YOU ASK THEM FOR

34:10.816 --> 34:12.118
HELP, A LOT OF THEM HELP YOU,

34:12.118 --> 34:12.751
RASHEEDA.

34:12.751 --> 34:13.952
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

34:13.952 --> 34:15.721
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.256
I WANT TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS,

34:17.256 --> 34:18.557
AND I CAN'T MAKE THEM MYSELF.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.558
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.459
YOU'RE DOING IT.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.793
THE THING IT IS, IS THAT YOU

34:21.793 --> 34:23.495
FEEL NEGLECTED, OKAY?

34:23.495 --> 34:25.131
AND YOU WANT TO DO THIS SO

34:25.131 --> 34:27.133
QUICKLY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU CAN

34:27.133 --> 34:28.634
DO THINGS THAT CAN BRING HARM

34:28.634 --> 34:29.435
TO YOURSELF.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.936
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO WHAT I

34:30.936 --> 34:32.471
THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING,

34:32.471 --> 34:33.805
WHICH IS MOVING FORWARD

34:33.805 --> 34:34.473
WITH MY CAREER.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.607
I DON'T WANT THIS TO SOUND

34:35.607 --> 34:36.942
EFFED UP.

34:36.942 --> 34:39.411
THEN WHY THIS?

34:39.411 --> 34:40.879
IF YOU WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD IN

34:40.879 --> 34:42.981
YOUR CAREER, THIS SHOULD HAVE

34:42.981 --> 34:44.150
NEVER HAPPENED.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.317
OKAY, YEAH, SHE THINK ABOUT

34:45.317 --> 34:46.318
THIS [bleep] PRETTY MUCH LIKE

34:46.318 --> 34:47.853
ANY OTHER MUSIC EXEC WOULD.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.054
I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT IT.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.289
I ALREADY HAD ENOUGH GOING ON,

34:50.289 --> 34:51.157
WHAT KIRK SAYS.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.258
BUT THEN I GOT DEB DOING IT--

34:52.258 --> 34:53.759
ANOTHER WOMAN, WHO SHOULD BE

34:53.759 --> 34:55.227
ABLE TO RELATE TO ME?

34:55.227 --> 34:56.395
I DON'T THINK YOU SEE WHAT

34:56.395 --> 34:58.464
ALL OF US OUT HERE SEE.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.232
EVERYBODY OUT HERE SEE WHAT'S

35:00.232 --> 35:01.267

35:01.267 --> 35:02.501
IT'S HORRIBLE.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.835
THEM SHOTS THAT I'M SHOOTING

35:03.835 --> 35:05.737
IN THERE ARE RIGHT HERE.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.473
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU WANTED TO

35:07.473 --> 35:09.308

35:09.308 --> 35:10.309
MANY OTHER THINGS, RASHEEDA,

35:10.309 --> 35:11.310
THAT YOU COULD HAVE DID.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.345
YOUR HAIR LINE, THE MAKEUP--

35:13.345 --> 35:14.613
WE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THAT.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.481
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

35:15.481 --> 35:16.515
I'M TRYING TO DO IT ALL.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.249
AND GUESS WHAT ELSE YOU

35:17.249 --> 35:17.916
COULD HAVE DID.

35:17.916 --> 35:18.717
GUESS WHAT ELSE YOU COULD

35:18.717 --> 35:19.451
HAVE DID.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.619
GUESS WHAT ELSE YOU COULD

35:20.619 --> 35:21.287
HAVE DID.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.554
GUESS WHAT ELSE.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.223
WHILE YOU LIKE THIS, BEST TIME

35:24.223 --> 35:25.224
IN THE WORLD TO BE IN THE DAMN

35:25.224 --> 35:26.057
STUDIO.

35:26.057 --> 35:27.559
WORK ON THEM RECORDS.

35:27.559 --> 35:29.060
GET YOUR COSMETIC LINE TOGETHER.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.662
GET YOUR HAIR LINE TOGETHER.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.431
SAVE THESE GODDAMN VIDEOS TILL

35:32.431 --> 35:33.565
AFTER, WHEN YOU COULD REALLY BE

35:33.565 --> 35:35.234
SEXY, AND GUESS WHAT.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.535
YOU WOULD HAVE TOOK RIGHT OFF.

35:36.535 --> 35:37.769
AND NOW YOU WOULD HAVE HAD THREE

35:37.769 --> 35:39.605
THINGS BUMPING AT ONE TIME.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.773
YOU WOULD HAVE CAME BACK STRONG.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.942
HARD AND STRONG.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.221
WE HAVE YOUR VIRGIN HAIR.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.121
WE HAVE YOUR INDIAN.

35:56.121 --> 35:56.955
WE HAVE YOUR BRAZILIAN.

35:56.955 --> 35:57.656
WE HAVE EVERYTHING,

35:57.656 --> 35:58.790
'CAUSE EVERY LADY HAS

35:58.790 --> 36:00.058
A DIFFERENT TEXTURE OF HAIR,

36:00.058 --> 36:01.059
AND WE WANT TO CAPTURE

36:01.059 --> 36:02.628
EVERY TEXTURE.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.362
KARLIE REDD

36:03.362 --> 36:05.331
CHAMPAGNE AND WEAVE--

36:05.331 --> 36:06.298
THAT'S WHAT SHE NAMED IT.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.466
CAN IT BE MORE HOOD?

36:07.466 --> 36:09.067
BUT THE ACTUAL EVENT WASN'T.

36:09.067 --> 36:09.735
IT WAS AMAZING.

36:09.735 --> 36:10.769
IT WAS PACKED.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.570
IT WAS A LOT OF MEDIA.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.139
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN, AND I

36:14.139 --> 36:15.341
THOUGHT SHE DID A GREAT JOB.

36:15.341 --> 36:16.342
THIS IS A GREAT TURNOUT.

36:16.342 --> 36:17.243
MAN, I DID NOT THINK...

36:17.243 --> 36:17.843
I AM SHOCKED.

36:17.843 --> 36:18.644
KARLIE COULD PUT THIS MANY

36:18.644 --> 36:20.111
PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.112
I DEFINITELY WANT TO SEE THE

36:21.112 --> 36:22.814
QUALITY, YOU KNOW, OF THIS HAIR,

36:22.814 --> 36:24.149
RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT--

36:24.149 --> 36:25.651
THE THING I REALLY LOOK FOR

36:25.651 --> 36:26.852
IN HAIR IS THE SHEDDING.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.354
I HATE WHEN ALL THE HAIR'S ON

36:28.354 --> 36:29.355
THE FLOOR.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.356
YEAH, I HATE WHEN IT STARTS

36:30.356 --> 36:32.023
THINNING OUT.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.158
SO I GUESS WE WILL

36:33.158 --> 36:33.825
EVENTUALLY FIND OUT.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.493
I'M HAPPY YOU CAME.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.160
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.362
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME,

36:36.362 --> 36:37.863
BECAUSE I PROBABLY WOULDN'T

36:37.863 --> 36:38.730
HAVE COME.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.398
I KNOW.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.400
[laughs]

36:44.270 --> 36:46.071
[squeals]

36:46.071 --> 36:47.873
HI.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.908
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

36:49.908 --> 36:50.776
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.511
I INVITED SHAY BECAUSE I WAS

36:52.511 --> 36:53.545
HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU GUYS

36:53.545 --> 36:54.280
COULD TALK.

36:54.280 --> 36:54.980
I THOUGHT THEY COULD CLEAR

36:54.980 --> 36:56.482
THE AIR, GET EVERYTHING OFF

36:56.482 --> 36:57.148
