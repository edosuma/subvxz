WEBVTT

01:42.852 --> 01:44.062
You smell of cigarettes.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.860
Should we continue after I brush my teeth?

01:51.444 --> 01:52.278
What?

01:52.362 --> 01:54.781
The others must be waiting. Let's go back.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.452
<i>I did it.</i>

02:10.171 --> 02:14.801
EPISODE 3: IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN.
NEVERTHELESS,

02:38.867 --> 02:41.077
<i>What is this emotion?</i>

02:50.128 --> 02:52.463
<i>I hope it's just love.</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:56.134
<i>Not childish jealousy.</i>

03:53.066 --> 03:56.069
Something seems to be going on
between Na-bi and Jae-eon, right?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.488
-Why do you say so?
-Those two

03:58.571 --> 04:00.823
disappeared for a while last night.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.660
And it seemed like something happened
between them.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.787
I could tell from her expression.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.582
And I saw them whispering something
by the door early in the morning.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.252
I couldn't hear what they said though.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.670
Are you the only one who saw?

04:13.753 --> 04:16.714
Yes, and I didn't tell Bit-na.
Good thing I didn't, right?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.800
-Good thinking.
-I'm starving.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.344
The noodles are here.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.973
It looks so good!

04:25.556 --> 04:28.309
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.186
And don't say anything to Na-bi.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.813
Don't worry.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.606
I'm going to steal this from you!

04:41.656 --> 04:42.991
Would it be okay though?

04:43.491 --> 04:44.993
What? Your belly fat?

04:45.076 --> 04:48.079
No! I mean Na-bi.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.791
She's probably having a hard time
after breaking up with her ex.

04:51.874 --> 04:55.086
She could get involved in gossip
by hanging out with him.

04:55.586 --> 04:58.798
I don't think
she should be seeing Jae-eon.

04:58.881 --> 04:59.966
Really?

05:01.050 --> 05:04.220
I think Jae-eon is better than her ex.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.056
What? Really? Why?

05:10.935 --> 05:12.812
I don't know. I can just feel it.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.939
They look good together.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.696
Got drunk and kissed…

05:21.779 --> 05:23.865
RECENT SEARCHES
KISSING SOMEONE BEFORE DATING

05:23.948 --> 05:26.576
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHO I HAVE NO FEELINGS FOR

05:26.659 --> 05:29.912
I MADE A MISTAKE WHILE DRUNK
EVERYONE THINKS WEIRDLY OF ME

05:29.996 --> 05:32.290
I GOT DRUNK AND KISSED MY FRIEND
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

05:32.373 --> 05:35.209
WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AFTER
WAS IT JUST A DRUNKEN MISTAKE?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.712
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE YOU'VE TOUCHED FIRST BASE

05:37.795 --> 05:39.881
YOU'LL END UP BECOMING SP
OR DRIFTING APART

05:40.757 --> 05:42.091
"SP"?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.387
"SP"? As in…

05:48.639 --> 05:49.891
"Sex partners"?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.226
Na-bi.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.480
You startled me.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.856
What were you looking at?

05:56.939 --> 05:59.776
Just looking for some references.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.573
Sol.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.036
If you want to kiss someone,

06:10.620 --> 06:14.916
does that mean you want
to sleep with them as well?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.211
Are you asking about me?

06:20.213 --> 06:21.089
Or is it about you?

06:21.172 --> 06:23.800
What? Me?

06:23.883 --> 06:27.178
No, it's not about me.

06:28.304 --> 06:32.058
I mean, generally. I just want to know
how people usually feel.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.853
I'm just trying to come up
with an idea for my assignment.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.106
I'm not sure.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.442
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.529
The other person…

07:20.481 --> 07:22.483
SEOL-A

07:24.735 --> 07:25.945
<i>I just got on the plane!</i>

07:31.075 --> 07:33.411
One-night…

07:36.205 --> 07:37.206
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

07:38.624 --> 07:40.918
I guess it'll depend on
who the other person is.

07:41.002 --> 07:41.919
"The other person"?

07:42.003 --> 07:45.506
You may want to kiss and have sex
with someone,

07:46.090 --> 07:49.552
or you might kiss someone
and not want to go further.

07:51.220 --> 07:53.806
So in the end, it depends
on who the other person is.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.892
<i>Then what kind of person</i>

07:56.934 --> 07:58.644
<i>am I to him?</i>

08:00.229 --> 08:02.106
ONE-NIGHT STAND?

08:20.416 --> 08:22.126
PARK JAE-EON

08:22.210 --> 08:25.505
SHOULDN'T WE TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY?

08:26.339 --> 08:28.216
<i>Would I seem too clingy?</i>

08:39.310 --> 08:42.271
-Hey!
-Hi!

08:42.355 --> 08:45.191
Hey, Na-bi.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.609
Hi.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.320
My battery's dead again.
Maybe I should get a new phone.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.490
-Where's Ji-wan?
-She's meeting someone.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.325
-What are you doing?
-I need a charger.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.702
She's watching a movie
with her blind date.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.496
She doesn't care much about school.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.332
Let's see…

09:02.959 --> 09:04.460
<i>I want to ask</i>

09:05.962 --> 09:10.800
<i>what I should say to get Jae-eon
to tell me how he really feels about me.</i>

09:10.883 --> 09:12.843
Do you really like that guy?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.637
-Yes.
-You don't look that way.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.597
Do you dance excitedly

09:16.681 --> 09:18.849
whenever you like someone's post?

09:18.933 --> 09:20.434
That's different though.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.566
Why would you sleep with someone

09:27.149 --> 09:30.820
you're not even dating?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.030
Isn't that meaningless?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.240
Gosh.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.077
Why do you always associate sex
with dating? Are you that old-fashioned?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.037
-Watch your mouth.
-Lower your voice!

09:40.121 --> 09:42.665
-Someone might hear you.
-I'm not saying anything wrong.

09:42.748 --> 09:45.334
I can say it even louder! Should I?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.461
Let's begin class!

09:48.087 --> 09:50.631
All right, let's begin class.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.926
-Hello, Professor.
-Hello.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.595
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.352
Try this.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.690
-You're not with your cute friend today.
-She's hanging out with someone else.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.359
She must be having fun.
I'll get you your food right away.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.445
Thank you. Give us a large serving.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.696
All right.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.198
You must be a regular here.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.493
Yes. My friend loves this place.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.413
But this place is quite famous
in this neighborhood.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.249
Danpunggol was the most popular
when I was in school.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.752
You went to school here?

10:27.835 --> 10:29.462
Yes. I was an Economics major.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.214
-I graduated two years ago.
-I see.

10:36.927 --> 10:40.514
I'm really sorry about last time.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.892
I put in an estimated amount.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.269
Tell me if it's not enough.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.937
It's really fine.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.191
It's okay. Keep it.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.533
This isn't why I asked to see you.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.994
Sorry? Then why…

11:06.290 --> 11:08.000
Here's your food.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.920
It's hot, so be careful. Enjoy.

11:11.003 --> 11:11.962
Thank you.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.175
-What's wrong?
-You're really strong.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.843
Do you work out?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.179
Oh, I major in sculpture.

11:20.805 --> 11:24.100
I always work with clay,
so I have a lot of strength in my hands.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.609
Just buy me this meal. That's enough.

11:34.193 --> 11:37.613
I wouldn't feel comfortable with that.

11:38.906 --> 11:42.827
-Then buy me coffee, too.
-I'll buy dessert as well.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.204
Okay.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.082
-Like this?
-Yes.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.334
-Do it like that.
-Thank you.

11:58.342 --> 11:59.885
That's it for today.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.596
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

12:02.680 --> 12:05.433
The weather is so nice today.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.351
You should all go on a date.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.353
-Okay.
-Come on.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.481
Why aren't you answering?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.358
Don't tell me you guys are all single.

12:14.942 --> 12:19.780
You should at least
have one proper relationship at your age.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.492
What they say about art
coming from loneliness is nonsense.

12:23.993 --> 12:28.038
Dating is the best way
to get inspiration for art.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.332
She's at it again.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.209
Didn't she say class was over?

12:32.293 --> 12:35.296
Love is what can make
even the roughest person become

12:35.379 --> 12:39.008
as soft as sand on a beach.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.428
I can't believe you guys.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.305
You guys are art majors, you know.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.474
They have no inspiration.

12:47.725 --> 12:51.395
One student told me a while ago

12:51.479 --> 12:53.731
that he doesn't want a relationship.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.691
He just wants to flirt and date around.

12:56.192 --> 13:00.529
Basically, he wants to have fun
with no strings attached.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.199
He should have one-night stands instead.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.701
It's so sad, isn't it?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.661
Goodness.

13:08.245 --> 13:11.540
Find your inspirations, all right?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.250
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's what art is.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.919
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.922
-Goodbye.
-Thank you for today.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.852
PARK YE-SOM, KANG SEO-YEON, LEE YE-HWA

13:31.936 --> 13:32.978
YU NA-BI

13:38.901 --> 13:40.986
I'M BUYING ART SUPPLIES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.828
Jae-eon.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.875
Welcome back.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.086
You've gotten more handsome.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.177
You must've enjoyed it, Ji-wan.

14:05.261 --> 14:08.514
Yes, it was so fun.
It was much better than I expected.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.517
-I want to watch it again with my friend.
-Your friend?

14:12.601 --> 14:14.937
-It's not a guy, right?
-It's a girl, of course.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.648
Her name's Sol. She's been my bestie
since middle school.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.025
I think she'll enjoy it, too.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.151
I'll watch it with her.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.114
Then Ji-wan,

14:25.197 --> 14:27.616
watch it again with me next time, too.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.869
Well, okay.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.538
But you didn't seem to enjoy it
as much as I did.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.540
I really enjoyed it too.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.627
It wasn't what I expected though.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.630
-What do you mean?
-I thought it would be about romance,

14:42.506 --> 14:43.966
but it was about friendship.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.719
Oh. Friendship?

14:46.802 --> 14:50.222
I felt that it was clearly about love,

14:50.306 --> 14:52.266
but I guess you could've seen it that way.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.226
Still, it was good.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.981
If you're hungry, should we go eat?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.983
Yes. I'm really hungry.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.112
I said I'd buy. Why did you pay?

15:06.363 --> 15:09.950
Well, I didn't think it'd be enough
to repay me.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.912
I knew it.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.754
Can you pay next time?

15:22.671 --> 15:24.340
I'd like to see you again.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.800
Why?

15:28.552 --> 15:31.472
It was fun hearing about your projects.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.059
-You ate…
-I eat quite a lot.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.269
Hey, it's Sol.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.229
She's the friend I just told you about.

15:39.313 --> 15:42.441
That's strange.
I'm not really a smooth talker.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.652
No, I really enjoyed listening to you.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.530
Who's that next to her?

15:49.114 --> 15:50.366
Where are you headed now?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.534
I'm taking the bus here.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.621
-I'll come with you.
-No, I can go by myself.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.250
Why don't you try calling her?

16:00.834 --> 16:02.002
No, it's fine.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.839
You two must be really close.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.175
Yes.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.344
Let's go.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.641
SCULPTURE STUDIO 3

16:47.297 --> 16:48.674
I'm so hungry.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.182
<i>Jae-eon still isn't contacting me.</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:05.691
<i>I don't know if he just doesn't care
about me or if he's teasing me.</i>

17:06.984 --> 17:08.610
<i>But whichever it is,</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:11.071
<i>it sucks.</i>

18:02.748 --> 18:03.791
<i>I hate to admit it,</i>

18:04.958 --> 18:09.046
<i>but I can't take my eyes off him
once he comes into my sight.</i>

18:26.522 --> 18:27.648
Hey, Seol-a.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.442
I knew it was you.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.862
Hang on. I'll be there soon.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.639
<i>Who is Seol-a?</i>

19:04.059 --> 19:04.977
Seol-a.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.237
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-It's okay.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.948
-<i>Who is she…</i>
-Should we get something to drink?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.366
-<i>to make him smile…</i>
-Okay.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.826
-<i>like that?</i>
-Let's go.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.924
<i>You're so pathetic, Na-bi.</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:38.093
<i>You're acting like a stalker.</i>

19:44.766 --> 19:46.727
<i>I could tell right away.</i>

19:47.477 --> 19:50.939
<i>She's the one Jae-eon's heart belongs to.</i>

19:55.194 --> 19:56.445
Welcome.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.405
Oh, Na-bi!

20:00.908 --> 20:03.118
I sat next to you yesterday.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.579
You stole my water, remember?

20:06.163 --> 20:07.539
Oh, that's my water.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.379
Oh, right. The freshman.
Your name is Kang Eun-han, right?

20:14.463 --> 20:16.006
It's Kim Eun-han.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.217
You're bad at remembering people.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.928
Sorry, there were
so many people yesterday.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.054
Do you work here?

20:22.137 --> 20:24.181
Yes. Just in the evenings. I just started.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.516
Was it fun last night?

20:27.684 --> 20:30.771
I wanted to hang out longer,
but I had to come and work.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.815
You haven't had dinner?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.817
No. I was working on my assignment.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.529
In that case. I was saving this,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.573
but you can have it.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.867
No, it's fine. You should have it.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.244
It's okay.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.371
I want you to have it.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.373
Thanks.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.792
I'll enjoy this.
Good luck with work, then.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.126
Na-bi.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.045
Can you give me your phone?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.215
-My phone?
-Yes.

21:08.892 --> 21:09.893
Do you know them?

21:11.436 --> 21:13.021
You keep looking at them.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.441
A freshman in our department.
He must work there.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.693
Not him.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.156
Is that girl a freshman, too?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.658
Here's my number.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.160
-I'll contact you later.
-Okay.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.871
No. She's my senior.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.250
Or maybe a friend.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.340
-Take care, then.
-Bye.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.883
-See you later.
-See you.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.684
You're still using that?

21:53.603 --> 21:55.147
-What about you?
-Me?

21:56.732 --> 21:59.109
I lost it a long time ago.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.155
That's disappointing.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.909
How are your butterflies doing?

22:07.993 --> 22:08.952
They're fine.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.664
But I'm going to set them free soon.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.291
Why?

22:15.292 --> 22:17.169
I feel guilty.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.256
They're supposed to be free,
but they're locked up

22:21.923 --> 22:23.008
because of me.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.970
You've grown up.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.558
That girl…

22:33.685 --> 22:34.895
Her name's Na-bi.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.942
So you haven't grown up.
You just found another butterfly.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.070
It's not like that.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.614
She's just a friend.

22:47.908 --> 22:48.909
You're lying.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.037
Even her name is Na-bi.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.456
Is it fate?

22:55.499 --> 22:56.958
Don't be ridiculous.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.211
You're my fate.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.509
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER
SLICE THE GREEN ONIONS

23:17.687 --> 23:20.357
NEW MESSAGE FROM KIM EUN-HAN

23:20.941 --> 23:22.192
<i>Hello, Na-bi!</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:24.402
<i>It's Kim Eun-han from a moment ago.</i>

23:24.486 --> 23:25.946
He messaged me right away.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.657
<i>Right. Hi.</i>

23:28.740 --> 23:30.951
<i>Are you coming to the flea market?</i>

23:31.034 --> 23:32.494
<i>I'm serving at our booth!</i>

23:32.577 --> 23:35.455
<i>Or you can come to the after-party.</i>

23:36.998 --> 23:38.917
<i>I hope you'll come.</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:40.752
<i>Okay, then.</i>

23:41.294 --> 23:44.297
<i>Really? Then I'll see you there!</i>

23:48.343 --> 23:51.388
<i>To be honest, it doesn't feel bad.</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:04.484
<i>By the way, are there days
when you don't have class?</i>

24:04.568 --> 24:07.320
<i>Oh, was that too personal?</i>

24:07.404 --> 24:08.697
<i>My apologies.</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:10.949
<i>Good night. See you at the festival!</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:13.910
<i>Sadly, I have class every day.</i>

24:14.703 --> 24:16.037
<i>Good night.</i>

24:21.585 --> 24:23.628
PARK JAE-EON

25:09.591 --> 25:10.884
Jae-eon!

25:13.136 --> 25:15.889
No way! You can do glass art, too?

25:15.972 --> 25:17.474
What are you making?

25:18.183 --> 25:19.476
What?

25:19.559 --> 25:22.270
Oh, I'm making a suncatcher.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.731
It's so pretty.
You're making a butterfly again.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.816
You really love butterflies, don't you?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.949
What? Do you have a cold?

25:34.532 --> 25:35.867
Stay away from me.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.703
I don't know. I have a headache.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.332
Are you sick from quitting Jae-eon?

25:42.916 --> 25:43.959
Withdrawal symptoms?

25:44.042 --> 25:45.502
What are you on about?

25:45.585 --> 25:47.420
You haven't been hanging out with him.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.297
Is it over now?

25:51.549 --> 25:53.051
I don't think we really click.

25:56.179 --> 25:58.014
I'm disappointed.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.517
The quiet kids usually end up causing
huge trouble.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.060
That disappoints you?

26:02.143 --> 26:05.438
Of course. I was looking forward to
some drama. This is so boring.

26:07.732 --> 26:11.236
You seem to want to push me into
Hell's pit just for your entertainment.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.364
Come on, don't say it like that.

26:14.447 --> 26:16.283
Like when you all came to my house.

26:16.366 --> 26:19.035
Why did you have to talk about
testing him and stuff?

26:19.119 --> 26:20.120
What about it?

26:21.162 --> 26:23.957
Why? Did something happen
between you two that day?

26:35.593 --> 26:38.805
I mean, it was useless
because nothing happened.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.557
You saw what it was like.

26:41.725 --> 26:44.978
Do you know what you need
to catch a big fish, Na-bi?

26:45.061 --> 26:46.813
You're going to say "patience," right?

26:48.648 --> 26:50.233
And he's not even a catch.

26:50.942 --> 26:51.776
He isn't?

26:51.860 --> 26:54.821
Well, it depends.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.866
Anyhow, are you sure he doesn't date?

26:58.867 --> 27:00.201
I'm sure. I told you.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.830
Why? Did he ask you out?

27:03.913 --> 27:08.501
No, it seemed like he was dating someone.
But maybe I'm mistaken.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.754
Na-bi! Hi!

27:10.837 --> 27:12.213
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.508
Hi, Eun-han. Are you going to eat lunch?

27:15.592 --> 27:18.136
-Yes.
-Enjoy your lunch.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.597
-You too.
-Okay.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.686
What was that with Eun-han?

27:26.770 --> 27:28.688
We got close recently.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.025
Is there something about him, too?

27:33.109 --> 27:35.111
No. Not that I know of.

27:35.945 --> 27:40.450
I knew it. You're receiving attention
as soon as you come out of your bubble.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.286
Gosh, but Eun-han's a bit boring.

27:43.370 --> 27:46.456
Leave me out of your fun, okay?

27:47.832 --> 27:50.627
So you're thinking of seeing him?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.712
It's not like that.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.800
This is a bit disappointing.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.227
Hi.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.896
You should get some vitamins.

28:13.024 --> 28:13.858
Thanks.

28:13.942 --> 28:14.984
How is that going?

28:16.486 --> 28:19.614
It's bad. I'm screwed this semester.

28:19.697 --> 28:22.617
No way. You're so good.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.369
What do you know?

28:24.452 --> 28:26.162
I know quite a lot.

28:26.871 --> 28:31.209
I actually saw your piece when I was here
for the entrance exam last year.

28:31.876 --> 28:32.919
Last year?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.756
Then it would have been…

28:45.223 --> 28:47.225
<i>LOVE</i>
YU NA-BI

28:47.308 --> 28:48.476
"<i>Love</i>"?

28:49.686 --> 28:51.062
"Yu Na-bi."

28:53.606 --> 28:56.276
<i>-The one about love?
-Yes.</i>

28:56.860 --> 28:59.738
I got scolded for making the same thing
over and over.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.948
I loved it. I even took a photo.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.491
Let me see.

29:04.534 --> 29:07.871
There aren't many pieces
that depict love just as it is.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.249
Everyone thinks they have to
make it look cool.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.419
Where is it?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.338
Oh, right. I got a new phone.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.799
Na-bi. Could I see it again?

29:19.883 --> 29:21.509
I promise to back up my photos.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.721
-Well…
-Yes?

29:25.305 --> 29:26.556
I threw it away.

29:26.639 --> 29:29.392
-Really?
-<i>Because my ex was the inspiration.</i>

29:29.476 --> 29:30.977
Is it really not here?

29:33.897 --> 29:34.939
Thanks.

29:35.732 --> 29:36.566
For what?

29:37.150 --> 29:41.196
To be honest, I gave up on the piece
I was working on,

29:41.279 --> 29:42.614
and I didn't know what to do.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.074
But you cheered me up.

29:49.537 --> 29:53.166
<i>He does seem pretty cute.</i>

29:54.000 --> 29:56.961
But it's a bit awkward
since you're talking so formally to me.

29:57.045 --> 29:57.962
Just talk casually.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.174
It's hard for me to do that
to people older than me.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.467
Oh, really?

30:03.176 --> 30:05.720
All right, then. Whatever you prefer.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.764
No. I'll talk casually

30:08.598 --> 30:09.766
from now on.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.601
Okay.

30:11.684 --> 30:15.772
Na-bi, everyone said this movie was good.
Did you watch it?

30:17.816 --> 30:22.028
No, I didn't. I haven't been
to a movie theater in a while.

30:22.111 --> 30:23.738
Do you want to watch it with me?

30:26.407 --> 30:28.493
-Is it a romantic movie?
-Yes.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.123
Hi.

30:34.707 --> 30:35.834
Hello.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.921
Oh, hi.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.132
What are you two talking about?

30:44.592 --> 30:46.553
We're going to watch a movie together.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.265
Should we watch something else, then?

30:51.975 --> 30:53.601
-Well…
-Hey.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.603
You're talking casually to her?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.066
Were you two close?

31:04.362 --> 31:08.241
Yes. We're close.
Closer than you and me, anyway.

31:10.743 --> 31:13.663
Let's watch this, Eun-han.
I like romantic movies.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.082
Okay, then.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.834
Hey.

31:19.085 --> 31:20.879
Isn't this erotic?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.714
That's better, then.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.008
Let's watch it.

31:25.091 --> 31:28.052
Right. You'll need a reference.

31:28.136 --> 31:29.095
What do you mean?

31:29.679 --> 31:30.680
The male lead.

31:31.639 --> 31:32.724
He's a good kisser.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.185
Na-bi's fussy about kisses.

31:37.478 --> 31:40.690
Be careful because she'll push you away
if she doesn't like it.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.900
See me outside.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.079
-What was that about?
-What?

31:55.163 --> 31:57.415
Why would you
suddenly mention kissing? Hey.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.168
Stop playing games with me.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.713
Playing games? You're the one
who pushed my hand away.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.423
I never let you touch my shoulder.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.550
There's nothing between us, you know.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.428
-Why are you so upset?
-I'm not upset!

32:14.891 --> 32:16.476
I'm not upset.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.481
You never contacted me since that day.
You know that?

32:21.564 --> 32:23.107
You didn't, either.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.235
And what's so wrong about that?

32:32.283 --> 32:34.243
I'm sorry,
but I'm not that kind of person.

32:36.746 --> 32:37.956
What do you mean by that?

32:39.916 --> 32:41.626
I thought you were enjoying it.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.587
Don't worry.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.090
I won't try anything with you.

32:49.425 --> 32:51.052
Good luck with Eun-han.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.726
Fine.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.944
Well, you left your phone…

33:09.362 --> 33:11.280
Right. Thanks.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.366
Na-bi.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.327
Should we go watch the movie?

33:20.915 --> 33:21.749
All right.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.601
Na-bi.

33:40.685 --> 33:44.022
I like butterflies
way more than dragonflies.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.440
You didn't eat, right?

33:46.024 --> 33:48.860
This place is really amazing. Try it.

33:48.943 --> 33:52.530
And you don't seem to be
in a good mood. So eat up.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.699
You should eat to cheer up.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.075
You should eat too.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.789
-Here, have some water.
-Thank you.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.875
Na-bi. That's my water.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.294
Stop that!

34:06.878 --> 34:08.755
-You seemed to like water.
-Stop it.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.340
<i>This is it.
Going on a date in the daytime.</i>

34:11.424 --> 34:13.676
-Right.
-<i>Sweet and innocent attraction.</i>

34:22.018 --> 34:23.811
I saw it!

34:28.149 --> 34:30.193
-"Miracle"?
-"Past"?

34:31.235 --> 34:33.196
That's great.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.906
-It's open.
-Yes! It's open!

34:38.993 --> 34:41.245
Could you take a photo of us?

34:41.329 --> 34:42.705
Thank you.

34:42.789 --> 34:45.208
All right, then. One, two.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.253
Can I have a combo set, please?

34:49.337 --> 34:51.172
Which flavor would you like?

34:52.131 --> 34:55.176
Well…

34:59.514 --> 35:03.351
<i>Eating and watching a movie together,
like a normal date.</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:05.561
<i>Something that suits me perfectly.</i>

35:18.449 --> 35:19.700
Come on, just once.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.286
One, two, three.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.292
It's a good photo. Let me take one of you.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.170
One, two, three.

35:32.713 --> 35:34.882
Let's eat.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.385
Here.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.306
Enjoy your meal.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.604
This is really good.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.022
-Is it?
-Yes.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.524
<i>Why do I…</i>

35:52.150 --> 35:54.277
<i>still have this on my phone?</i>

35:55.862 --> 35:56.696
Na-bi.

35:58.030 --> 36:00.533
I didn't know what you'd like,
so I got everything.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.660
Oh, okay.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.371
-Should I buy more?
-No, it's fine. Thanks.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.126
This is really tasty.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.380
<i>Will things keep piling up like this?</i>

36:14.463 --> 36:17.383
<i>I was a loser who was always running away.</i>

36:19.760 --> 36:23.389
<i>But I can't run away from you.</i>

36:27.268 --> 36:28.686
<i>I like everything about you,</i>

36:30.479 --> 36:32.148
<i>and I can't stop thinking about you.</i>

36:34.984 --> 36:36.360
<i>I…</i>

36:40.031 --> 36:41.532
<i>I love you.</i>

36:49.123 --> 36:51.542
What are you thinking, Na-bi?

36:53.002 --> 36:56.005
I wasn't thinking of anything. Why?

36:56.839 --> 36:59.884
You didn't seem to be in a good mood
since we were in the theater.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.471
-So I thought you didn't like the movie.
-Well…

37:04.263 --> 37:05.765
I'm just not feeling too good.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.185
It was a bit too cheesy, right?

37:09.769 --> 37:10.895
Really?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.731
I enjoyed it a lot.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.611
It made me want to have
a relationship like that too.

37:18.694 --> 37:21.072
I suddenly got that feeling…

37:26.327 --> 37:29.121
Actually, I heard you and Jae-eon earlier.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.125
Oh, I see.

37:34.919 --> 37:38.089
-But he's…
-I know. It's over now, right?

37:38.172 --> 37:39.465
"Over"?

37:46.180 --> 37:48.516
You know that he only hurts other people.

37:49.183 --> 37:52.520
Don't let someone who was never sincere
toward you hurt you.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.688
I know…

37:54.313 --> 37:57.608
what it's like. But it's all meaningless.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.236
And most of all,
you two don't suit each other.

38:04.156 --> 38:05.449
All right.

38:08.828 --> 38:09.829
Okay.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.843
Sorry, Eun-han.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.344
I…

38:25.845 --> 38:28.097
I was about to sneeze.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.348
Forget it.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.853
I really did! Eun-han!

39:04.175 --> 39:05.801
He is pretty cute, but…

39:12.183 --> 39:13.476
Are you with someone?

39:13.559 --> 39:14.810
Because you're cute.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.366
<i>I just don't feel a spark with him
like I did with Jae-eon.</i>

39:42.338 --> 39:43.839
PARK JAE-EON

39:43.923 --> 39:45.383
DELETE

39:48.010 --> 39:50.805
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
DELETE THIS CONTACT?

39:57.186 --> 39:58.646
DELETE

40:12.326 --> 40:14.203
PAINKILLER

40:19.500 --> 40:20.626
<i>What do you mean?</i>

40:20.709 --> 40:22.461
<i>You heard me.</i>

40:22.545 --> 40:25.923
<i>The landlord said you can't get
an extension.</i>

40:26.006 --> 40:27.675
But why?

40:28.175 --> 40:31.887
I should've been notified
at least three months in advance, then.

40:31.971 --> 40:35.015
-<i>Whatever. I relayed the message.</i>
-Excuse me!

40:36.517 --> 40:38.185
What the heck?

40:38.769 --> 40:39.937
Darn it.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.647
Oh, my gosh!

40:47.611 --> 40:50.322
-Na-bi!
-Hello!

40:50.406 --> 40:52.741
Hey, you look really good in that.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.410
Thank you, my lady.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.370
Are you not coming to our booth?

40:57.538 --> 41:00.207
I'm okay. How are the preparations going?

41:00.291 --> 41:02.334
I'm sure it's going great.
They have Jae-eon.

41:02.418 --> 41:05.171
My friends said they're coming,
but there might not be seats.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.298
-You have friends?
-Of course I do!

41:09.216 --> 41:11.844
So what will you do?
Can you find a house within a month?

41:12.428 --> 41:15.431
If I can't, I'll have to find
a small studio or something.

41:16.182 --> 41:17.433
Or some housemates.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.935
What about all your stuff?

41:21.103 --> 41:24.523
I guess I'll have to use
a storage service.

41:25.649 --> 41:29.069
Darn it! What do I do?

41:29.153 --> 41:30.988
The rent is expensive around here now.

41:31.071 --> 41:33.741
It'll be impossible to find
another place with cheap rent.

41:34.408 --> 41:36.035
I'm screwed!

41:37.286 --> 41:39.038
Hey, calm down.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.998
How much was the rent?

41:42.791 --> 41:44.668
-Hello!
-Hello!

41:44.752 --> 41:46.629
-Hi.
-Can we have more butane?

41:46.712 --> 41:48.797
And where can we get more folding chairs?

41:48.881 --> 41:50.216
In the clubroom.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.634
Oh, right.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.844
Tell Sol not to come to the booth.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.680
She'll run into Professor Lee
and get nagged to death.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.557
Why would she get nagged?

41:58.641 --> 41:59.934
Don't you know?

42:00.726 --> 42:01.936
The exchange program.

42:02.019 --> 42:04.438
It's really exhausting for me, too.

42:04.522 --> 42:08.067
She'll get a full scholarship.
What's holding her back?

42:08.150 --> 42:09.735
Some people are dying to go.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.905
It's not an easy decision to make though.
Here you go.

42:13.405 --> 42:14.532
Exchange program?

42:15.115 --> 42:17.409
What? You didn't know?

42:17.493 --> 42:19.411
-No.
-How did you not know?

42:19.995 --> 42:21.872
All the professors are going.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.249
-Let's take these.
-Okay.

42:23.749 --> 42:24.583
Let's go.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.127
-I'll go with them.
-Bye.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.337
Let's go.

42:29.838 --> 42:32.925
What's going on?

42:33.008 --> 42:34.927
Goodness.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.198
What are you doing here?

42:56.782 --> 42:57.866
Nothing.

42:59.118 --> 43:01.036
Aren't you going to the flea market?

43:01.120 --> 43:03.122
-Are you going to see Eun-han?
-What?

43:04.206 --> 43:06.417
I heard something's going on
between you and him.

43:07.001 --> 43:09.128
-I heard everything.
-From Bit-na, right?

43:09.211 --> 43:10.379
I'm glad.

43:10.963 --> 43:14.883
I don't know him well,
but he's way better than Jae-eon.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.891
Last time, when the professor
called you and Sol…

43:22.975 --> 43:25.436
It was because
of the exchange program, right?

43:26.061 --> 43:27.229
Well…

43:30.816 --> 43:31.817
Yes.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.571
I see.

43:35.654 --> 43:37.948
But Bit-na didn't hear from Sol, either.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.827
Sol was probably thinking
of telling you first.

43:41.910 --> 43:44.622
And I only heard when I met
the professor with her.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.498
I don't know.

43:47.207 --> 43:50.169
I bet she didn't tell me
because I'd feel upset.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.588
Did I tell you before?

43:52.671 --> 43:54.798
I started art because of Sol.

43:54.882 --> 43:55.966
Really?

43:56.592 --> 43:57.593
I didn't know.

43:58.177 --> 44:00.971
She wanted to major in art
since she was in middle school.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.474
And I worked so hard to join her.

44:04.350 --> 44:08.270
I thought I'd at least be able
to keep up with her if I did my best.

44:10.272 --> 44:12.608
But I guess there are things
you can never do.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.194
I can barely get my assignments done.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.198
I don't even know if I can graduate.

44:23.285 --> 44:25.079
I'm so jealous of her.

44:25.871 --> 44:28.415
That kind of presence
only comes naturally.

44:28.499 --> 44:29.833
Right.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.253
Some people are gifted like that.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.219
Let's go to the flea market.

44:40.719 --> 44:43.347
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.184
SCULPTURE DEPARTMENT FLEA MARKET

44:54.024 --> 44:55.442
Is everything going okay?

44:59.446 --> 45:01.365
All right, the next two people. Come in.

45:01.448 --> 45:03.742
She's just not my type.

45:09.748 --> 45:10.874
Why is he here?

45:10.958 --> 45:14.670
I know, right? He's not even here to help.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.630
-He's not even paying.
-Right.

45:16.713 --> 45:18.674
He's just here to watch us.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.634
-That looks nice.
-No.

45:21.635 --> 45:22.845
-Here you go.
-Can I…

45:23.512 --> 45:24.847
have your number?

45:25.681 --> 45:26.932
Sorry.

45:27.015 --> 45:28.767
What was that? Namaste?

45:28.851 --> 45:31.687
-I should use this gesture too.
-Where would you use that?

45:32.771 --> 45:35.232
Hey, let's go.

45:35.315 --> 45:36.900
Why? You wanted to come.

45:37.484 --> 45:39.570
It's too noisy and crowded in here.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.947
-And there aren't any pretty girls.
-But there are.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.575
Let's just go. Come on.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.077
Hey, they're leaving.

45:47.161 --> 45:48.745
-What a relief.
-Why's he leaving?

45:48.829 --> 45:50.706
-You're leaving?
-Yes!

45:50.789 --> 45:53.375
Hey, they're gone. Go and serve the food.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.378
Gosh. It's a festival,
but they're not selling drinks, Professor.

45:57.379 --> 45:58.755
This is unbelievable.

45:58.839 --> 46:02.050
-He really is popular, isn't he?
-This place is so nice.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.595
-You're so handsome.
-Thank you.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.305
-You must be tired.
-Can I have your number?

46:06.388 --> 46:09.266
-Sorry.
-They're all smiling from ear to ear.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.478
-Are you two dating?
-What? No!

46:12.561 --> 46:15.481
Why are you overreacting?
Kids like you always end up dating.

46:15.564 --> 46:17.983
Professor, that's never going to happen.

46:18.066 --> 46:20.319
Watch what you say.
It could really happen.

46:20.402 --> 46:23.655
No way. Hey, Jin-su. Come over here.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.282
Professor, this is…

46:25.365 --> 46:26.575
By the way,

46:27.534 --> 46:30.662
that student over there.
He's Park Jae-eon, right?

46:30.746 --> 46:32.289
-Yes.
-Yes.

46:32.873 --> 46:36.168
I remember him since he's very competent.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.590
I should get going.

46:41.673 --> 46:43.217
-Have fun.
-All right.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.385
-Don't cause any trouble.
-Okay.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.429
-Jin-su will show you out.
-I'll escort you.

46:47.513 --> 46:50.641
Okay. I have some work
to finish up, so I'll get going.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.476
-Bye, then.
-I'll see you later.

46:52.559 --> 46:55.103
-Bye.
-Don't cause any trouble.

46:55.187 --> 46:56.271
Bye, Professor.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.607
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.735
I thought she'd leave
like three hours ago.

47:02.694 --> 47:06.198
So she remembers him
because of his competency?

47:06.281 --> 47:10.494
I bet she remembers him
because he's so handsome.

47:10.577 --> 47:12.454
Hey, where did you steal this?

47:12.538 --> 47:14.039
We can't sell alcohol here.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.791
I bought it at a convenience store.

47:16.375 --> 47:17.668
Can't I even do that?

47:17.751 --> 47:21.630
You're going to drink at the after-party.
Can't you hold yourself back?

47:21.713 --> 47:25.551
Seriously, you nag more than my mom.

47:25.634 --> 47:29.221
If you get drunk today, I'm really
going to abandon you on the streets.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.690
That looks delicious.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.276
Hey, Ji-wan! Over here.

47:42.359 --> 47:45.445
Hey! You got really good seats.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.864
Why don't you join us?
I'll introduce you to them.

47:47.948 --> 47:49.658
No, I'm fine. Have fun.

47:49.741 --> 47:51.159
Then call me if you get bored.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.661
Okay.

47:52.744 --> 47:54.663
-Have fun.
-Okay.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.126
When did you come?

47:59.209 --> 48:00.335
You should've called me.

48:00.419 --> 48:03.672
ARTISTS THAT SHINE
LOOKING FOR ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE

48:10.095 --> 48:11.388
This is the usual serving.

48:11.471 --> 48:14.474
But I added more
since you seemed like you'd eat a lot.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.276
Eun-han.

48:29.906 --> 48:30.991
Hey, Na-bi.

48:32.117 --> 48:33.869
There are so many people.

48:33.952 --> 48:37.122
-Our department's the most crowded.
-Right. Well…

48:37.998 --> 48:40.000
-Are you here with anyone?
-What?

48:40.083 --> 48:43.128
There are so many people.
I didn't think it'd get so crowded.

48:43.211 --> 48:45.047
Maybe you should just go somewhere else.

48:45.130 --> 48:47.799
No, I just came to see you for a moment.

48:47.883 --> 48:49.009
As I promised.

48:52.471 --> 48:53.805
Right.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.182
Eun-han!

48:59.394 --> 49:02.564
When do you get off?
We're thinking of getting drinks.

49:08.236 --> 49:10.364
Who is she? Your friend?

49:11.365 --> 49:13.200
She's a senior that I'm close with.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.705
Oh, hello.

49:19.581 --> 49:22.000
Right. Hi.

49:23.126 --> 49:26.755
Well, why don't you go ahead first?
I'll join you after I finish.

49:26.838 --> 49:29.049
Okay. Call me when you're done.

49:29.132 --> 49:30.300
All right.

49:35.597 --> 49:37.974
-I'll see you later, then.
-It's not like that.

49:38.558 --> 49:41.853
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.523
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday…

49:50.654 --> 49:52.280
I'm really sorry.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.824
All right.

50:03.125 --> 50:04.584
Let's begin the game. Se-hun?

50:04.668 --> 50:07.129
-All right. Let's spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

50:07.212 --> 50:09.256
-That looks fun.
-Let's try that later.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.757
Speed quiz!

50:10.841 --> 50:13.051
-Is it only for couples?
-I don't think so.

50:13.135 --> 50:16.054
By the way, that guy has a crush
on Sol, right?

50:16.138 --> 50:17.681
You got it right!

50:17.764 --> 50:19.307
-Right or…
-Wrong.

50:20.308 --> 50:21.560
How would I know?

50:22.144 --> 50:24.896
I'm sure of it. I told him we were
Sol's friends,

50:24.980 --> 50:26.565
and he gave us so much food.

50:27.816 --> 50:29.401
Sol's not that close to him.

50:29.484 --> 50:32.988
Well, since you two are so close.
Don't you get sick of each other?

50:34.781 --> 50:37.743
We don't hang out as much as we did
these days.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.620
Right. You've been dating a lot.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.247
-Spin the wheel!
-Spin the wheel!

50:42.330 --> 50:45.250
-Spin!
-But I kind of feel sorry for him.

50:45.333 --> 50:49.045
If Sol goes to the States, she'll be
hanging out with hot American guys.

50:49.129 --> 50:52.758
Wasn't she going to England?
It seemed like she was going to Europe.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.551
Is she really going though? When?

50:54.634 --> 50:56.344
How did you guys know?

50:56.428 --> 50:58.847
What do you mean?
Can I have some of your juice?

50:58.930 --> 51:00.724
-Here.
-Thanks.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.935
Hey, there's Sol!

51:04.019 --> 51:05.312
She's with someone though.

51:05.395 --> 51:06.480
Hey, Sol!

51:06.563 --> 51:08.315
Isn't he the guy from the café?

51:08.398 --> 51:10.817
Hey, I think he is.

51:12.110 --> 51:13.320
Hi, I'm Jung Ju-hyeok.

51:13.403 --> 51:15.655
-Hi!
-Hi.

51:15.739 --> 51:17.574
Is he your boyfriend, Sol?

51:18.283 --> 51:19.284
No.

51:19.367 --> 51:22.245
Have you been seeing each other
since then?

51:22.871 --> 51:26.374
I had business nearby, and I asked her
to show me around school.

51:26.458 --> 51:29.628
-Let's go!
-Let's go play a couple's game!

51:29.711 --> 51:32.088
-A couple's game!
-Couple's game!

51:32.172 --> 51:33.507
All right.

51:33.590 --> 51:35.425
-Let's…
-Sol!

51:35.509 --> 51:37.844
Sol! Come play…

51:38.887 --> 51:40.096
Are you…

51:40.597 --> 51:42.349
Are you two a couple?

51:43.183 --> 51:45.894
-You're here to play the couple's game!
-Don't they look good together?

51:45.977 --> 51:48.313
-Let me through.
-You have to throw a dart

51:48.396 --> 51:50.732
and play the game it lands on.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.692
That's all you have to do.

51:52.776 --> 51:53.985
You try it.

51:54.069 --> 51:55.320
-Me?
-Yes.

51:55.403 --> 51:57.823
You should give up.
You're no match to him.

51:59.574 --> 52:01.159
Okay, let's go.

52:01.243 --> 52:03.161
Se-hun, spin the wheel.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.789
All right, I'll spin the wheel.

52:05.872 --> 52:08.834
Spin the wheel!

52:09.334 --> 52:13.380
Oh, it's "Pop the Balloon"!
The most exciting game.

52:13.463 --> 52:15.215
-What is it?
-You two, come over here.

52:15.298 --> 52:18.844
I can't believe Sol's hanging out with
a guy. He's really handsome, isn't he?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.512
I'll put a balloon right here.

52:20.595 --> 52:23.515
-What?
-Stick together like this.

52:23.598 --> 52:25.058
And pop it with your bodies.

52:25.141 --> 52:27.102
You succeed if you pop it in five seconds.

52:27.185 --> 52:28.937
All right, let's begin.

52:29.020 --> 52:31.690
Ready, go.

52:33.191 --> 52:36.319
You did it! Congratulations!

52:36.403 --> 52:37.988
Take your prize.

52:38.071 --> 52:39.823
-There's a prize?
-Take your pick.

52:39.906 --> 52:41.199
Did Sol tell you anything?

52:42.033 --> 52:44.619
No, she didn't.
She said they're not dating.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.329
It doesn't seem like that.

52:46.830 --> 52:49.749
I can totally tell from the guy's face.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.460
Why else would he have come here?
There's nothing to see.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.754
He just came to take a look around.

52:55.797 --> 52:58.049
Sol's so lucky.

52:58.133 --> 53:00.886
You know how they say
you'll get really lucky with men

53:00.969 --> 53:02.888
after you have no one for a while.

53:02.971 --> 53:05.891
It's an undeniable truth, you know.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.976
She said they're not dating.

53:11.313 --> 53:13.899
-Why are you giving me this?
-You like that character.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.443
I don't like it anymore.

53:17.736 --> 53:19.112
Is there something going on?

53:19.905 --> 53:22.991
We were supposed to hang out together.
Why did you bring a guy along?

53:23.074 --> 53:23.909
Oh…

53:25.410 --> 53:26.369
I…

53:28.121 --> 53:29.164
Well…

53:31.207 --> 53:33.919
Sorry. I didn't think
it would make you uncomfortable.

53:34.002 --> 53:36.630
If I knew, I would've brought a guy too.

53:36.713 --> 53:38.840
Did you enjoy playing the couple's game?

53:42.552 --> 53:43.428
I need to smoke.

53:44.429 --> 53:45.555
-Hey.
-What's with you?

53:57.192 --> 53:58.568
Lime?

53:59.319 --> 54:00.862
I think you'll like it.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.199
-Me?
-You said so at the club.

54:07.243 --> 54:08.536
You remember that?

54:21.299 --> 54:23.218
You must be exhausted.

54:23.301 --> 54:24.511
Good work.

54:24.594 --> 54:27.889
But the after-party begins now,
so let's go have fun!

54:31.643 --> 54:33.353
You're all going to get wasted today!

54:36.314 --> 54:38.108
-Guys, take this.
-Thanks!

54:39.025 --> 54:41.069
-Move!
-Move over!

55:01.006 --> 55:02.674
Gosh, my head.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.191
I should go buy medicine.

55:27.323 --> 55:30.410
I've liked her since I was in high school,
but she rejected me.

55:30.493 --> 55:33.496
And she suddenly contacted me yesterday.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.040
I'm really sorry.

55:36.458 --> 55:37.959
<i>So I was just a replacement?</i>

55:38.668 --> 55:40.295
<i>Whatever. I don't care now.</i>

55:41.546 --> 55:42.422
<i>But…</i>

55:42.505 --> 55:45.008
She suddenly contacted me yesterday.
I'm really sorry.

55:50.138 --> 55:51.556
<i>So embarrassing…</i>

56:07.822 --> 56:09.074
Who is this?

56:16.873 --> 56:18.208
Hello?

56:18.291 --> 56:19.375
<i>What are you doing?</i>

56:21.169 --> 56:22.253
Park Jae-eon?

56:23.088 --> 56:23.922
Wait.

56:24.672 --> 56:25.840
Did you delete my number?

56:26.341 --> 56:27.926
Well…

56:38.103 --> 56:39.062
Why did you call?

56:40.188 --> 56:41.606
What's wrong with your voice?

56:42.732 --> 56:43.900
Are you sick?

56:44.609 --> 56:46.611
I'm not feeling well.

56:48.279 --> 56:50.865
<i>I'm near your house right now.</i>

56:54.369 --> 56:55.495
So?

57:00.041 --> 57:01.751
Why would you come here?

57:02.627 --> 57:04.379
My friend lives nearby.

57:04.462 --> 57:07.298
<i>Okay. Have fun.</i>

57:07.382 --> 57:08.508
Na-bi.

57:11.177 --> 57:12.345
Yes?

57:13.138 --> 57:14.889
Do you want to meet right now?

57:18.184 --> 57:19.519
Right now?

57:45.920 --> 57:47.005
So cold.

57:50.967 --> 57:53.428
Why don't they have any medicine?

58:07.275 --> 58:08.401
There must've been an accident.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.403
-There's even a police car.
-Is someone hurt?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.280
-What's going on?
-Why is there a police car?

58:12.947 --> 58:14.365
Was there an accident?

58:14.449 --> 58:15.408
Is it a student?

58:15.992 --> 58:18.912
-A student lives there.
-Excuse me.

58:18.995 --> 58:20.246
EMERGENCY RESPONSE

58:20.330 --> 58:21.915
-The third floor?
-Isn't that her?

58:22.790 --> 58:25.502
Hey! Can you hear me?

58:25.585 --> 58:27.504
I think something happened to her! Hurry!

58:27.587 --> 58:29.422
Calm down and stay back.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.174
We should open it.

58:31.257 --> 58:33.927
-Hurry.
-Wait!

58:34.010 --> 58:35.803
Wait, sir. Wait!

58:36.346 --> 58:38.806
What are you doing? Who called you?

58:45.980 --> 58:47.148
I'm sorry.

58:47.232 --> 58:49.067
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. We'll get going.

59:01.246 --> 59:03.540
You know you totally overreacted, right?

59:04.707 --> 59:06.084
I was just worried.

59:06.668 --> 59:09.712
You said you were sick.
Plus, you live alone.

59:15.593 --> 59:19.138
All right.
Well, you know that I'm alive now.

59:19.722 --> 59:20.848
Bye.

59:21.683 --> 59:22.684
Are you really okay?

59:24.394 --> 59:25.520
I'm fine.

59:27.564 --> 59:29.482
You have a fever.
Let's go to the hospital.

59:29.566 --> 59:30.608
It's fine.

59:31.776 --> 59:34.445
I'll be fine if I get some sleep.

59:37.782 --> 59:38.825
Bye.

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:01.848
Hey.

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:05.310
Let's go. Come on.

1:00:05.393 --> 1:00:06.978
Everyone left.

1:00:11.816 --> 1:00:13.318
I'm really leaving.

1:00:14.569 --> 1:00:16.571
Get a grip.

1:00:16.654 --> 1:00:18.948
Don't you know how late it is?

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:26.748
What are you doing?

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:30.668
Come on, let's--

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:33.171
Shut up.

1:00:36.841 --> 1:00:38.593
You kind of…

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:40.178
look…

1:00:41.512 --> 1:00:42.930
handsome up close.

1:01:24.138 --> 1:01:25.515
<i>Was I too cold?</i>

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:28.518
No.

1:01:29.644 --> 1:01:30.645
I did the right thing.

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:33.940
I should just get some sleep.

1:01:40.613 --> 1:01:41.823
Who is it?

1:01:46.828 --> 1:01:48.121
Can I come in?

1:01:49.789 --> 1:01:51.082
Oh, sure.

1:01:56.379 --> 1:01:59.799
There weren't any pharmacies open,
so I went to a convenience store.

1:02:03.136 --> 1:02:05.304
Take some medicine after you eat.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:07.724
Okay. Thanks.

1:02:08.975 --> 1:02:10.727
Get some sleep, then. Bye.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:13.646
<i>You really came back because of this?</i>

1:02:14.230 --> 1:02:15.273
Hey, Jae-eon.

1:02:18.192 --> 1:02:19.318
I don't like this.

1:02:20.319 --> 1:02:21.279
Take it back.

1:02:27.910 --> 1:02:29.245
I'm hungry.

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:34.167
You didn't even eat until this hour?

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:37.754
I didn't have an appetite
since I smelled food all day.

1:02:39.922 --> 1:02:41.007
But I'm hungry now.

1:02:48.681 --> 1:02:52.769
Then you can eat this here.

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:02.695
This is really tasty.

1:03:05.615 --> 1:03:08.993
-I haven't had homemade food in a while.
-My aunt made all this.

1:03:09.076 --> 1:03:10.828
The aunt who named you?

1:03:12.622 --> 1:03:13.790
Yes.

1:03:18.503 --> 1:03:19.420
You must be sleepy.

1:03:20.004 --> 1:03:22.507
Yes. Probably because of the medicine.

1:03:22.590 --> 1:03:24.425
I'm so sleepy now.

1:03:26.219 --> 1:03:27.845
-Go lie down.
-It's fine.

1:03:28.638 --> 1:03:30.181
I'll sleep after you leave.

1:03:31.974 --> 1:03:33.476
I ate your food,

1:03:35.895 --> 1:03:37.396
so let me help you.

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:39.649
What?

1:03:39.732 --> 1:03:42.318
Hey! What are you doing?

1:03:43.694 --> 1:03:45.613
Hey, let me down.

1:03:46.906 --> 1:03:48.157
Wait!

1:04:15.017 --> 1:04:17.937
"There was a boy in the small store.

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:21.107
He waited for the girl every day."

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:24.277
What are you doing?

1:04:24.902 --> 1:04:26.028
Go home now.

1:04:26.737 --> 1:04:29.282
I'll go home when you fall asleep.
Don't worry.

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:32.702
It's worse to see you gone
when I wake up later.

1:04:35.329 --> 1:04:36.539
Should I stay, then?

1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:41.168
I didn't mean that…

1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:45.506
<i>Right. I don't want you to leave.</i>

1:04:48.885 --> 1:04:50.511
You're really weird.

1:04:50.595 --> 1:04:53.472
The way you talk, and the things you do…

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:55.474
You even called 911.

1:04:58.311 --> 1:05:01.731
You mean you want to think of me
as a jerk,

1:05:02.315 --> 1:05:04.025
but I actually seem okay, right?

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:06.819
You're so annoying.

1:05:10.948 --> 1:05:12.033
To tell you the truth,

1:05:13.075 --> 1:05:15.369
I was shocked when I saw you with Eun-han.

1:05:17.121 --> 1:05:19.373
-Why?
-I don't know.

1:05:21.709 --> 1:05:23.294
Maybe I got jealous.

1:05:23.377 --> 1:05:25.171
You deleted my number,

1:05:26.172 --> 1:05:27.715
but you seemed happy with him.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:33.512
Then you would've felt good

1:05:34.096 --> 1:05:36.307
when you saw me get rejected.

1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:44.690
Save my number again.

1:05:45.274 --> 1:05:48.235
I'm not such a bad guy, am I?

1:05:51.238 --> 1:05:54.241
<i>I don't know if it's because of
the fever or because of him,</i>

1:05:54.325 --> 1:05:55.743
<i>but I feel so dizzy.</i>

1:05:57.870 --> 1:06:01.248
Why are you doing this to me?
Because my name means "butterfly"?

1:06:01.832 --> 1:06:04.835
I've been attracted to you
from the beginning.

1:06:07.171 --> 1:06:09.340
Oh, I see.

1:06:12.176 --> 1:06:14.136
You're so funny, you know that?

1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:16.138
What's so funny?

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:18.474
Why do you ask
if you won't even believe me?

1:06:18.557 --> 1:06:20.810
You're not really trustworthy, you know.

1:06:20.893 --> 1:06:24.063
Then will you see me in a different light
if I try to earn your trust?

1:07:17.950 --> 1:07:21.162
<i>Maybe he really…</i>

1:07:37.386 --> 1:07:38.679
Your fever's down.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:43.893
You really nursed me
the old-fashioned way?

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:46.270
Classic methods are the best.

1:07:48.355 --> 1:07:49.648
You're right.

1:07:53.986 --> 1:07:55.529
I should get ready for school.

1:08:16.926 --> 1:08:18.803
Why don't you leave your hair down?

1:08:20.888 --> 1:08:23.015
-It's uncomfortable.
-Still.

1:08:23.891 --> 1:08:25.392
Just for me.

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:52.169
Then…

1:08:55.381 --> 1:08:57.383
I want to see your hair tied up.

1:09:42.887 --> 1:09:44.138
It's pretty.

1:14:17.369 --> 1:14:21.165
<i>His touch and his scent.
I already got used to them.</i>

1:14:21.248 --> 1:14:24.001
<i>I want to keep seeing you. What about you?</i>

1:14:24.084 --> 1:14:26.336
<i>Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.</i>

1:14:26.420 --> 1:14:28.297
<i>-Be my girlfriend.
-You're overreacting.</i>

1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:30.340
<i>-Do you like me?
-Na-bi?</i>

1:14:30.424 --> 1:14:34.678
<i>-The channel name reminded me of you.
-So you've thought about me?</i>

1:14:34.761 --> 1:14:36.263
<i>I got you!</i>

1:14:36.889 --> 1:14:37.890
<i>I have a gift for you.</i>

1:14:38.765 --> 1:14:40.809
<i>We're much more compatible than I thought,</i>

1:14:40.893 --> 1:14:43.770
<i>and I enjoy spending nights with him.</i>

1:14:43.854 --> 1:14:46.106
<i>Is there someone else you're seeing?</i>

1:14:46.190 --> 1:14:48.192
Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

1:14:48.275 --> 1:14:49.568
We should end it.

1:14:49.651 --> 1:14:51.195
<i>I don't want to let go.</i>

1:14:51.278 --> 1:14:52.154
<i>Not yet.</i>

1:14:52.821 --> 1:14:55.449
<i>I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.</i>

1:14:56.200 --> 1:14:57.367
<i>Like crazy.</i>

1:14:57.910 --> 1:15:01.622
