10:58.074 --> 11:00.367
and I pushed myself
outside my comfort zone.

and not speaking the language.

Anyways, I explored the city today, too,

11:24.934 --> 11:29.981
when I was putting up my fliers,
so I may teach the world to dance again.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.860
There's a part of you that actually thinks
the world stopped dancing

11:36.529 --> 11:37.363
Yes.

-Mom, today was the best day.
-Ooh!

11:43.953 --> 11:47.456
Everyone saw me in Schneider's Range Rover
and thought I was a total pimp!

11:47.539 --> 11:49.500
Mmm.

11:49.583 --> 11:53.087
Don't say pimp or you'll get grounded!

11:53.921 --> 11:55.882
Seriously, Mom, his car is amazing.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.216
The seats warm up.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.511
You wouldn't think you want a warm butt...
but you totally do.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.680
It's all the best parts of
peeing your pants

12:03.764 --> 12:05.349
without any of the wetness.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.439
You should've seen Schneider.
The other parents were obsessed.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.649
[chuckles]

12:13.732 --> 12:18.737
Connie Merkelson told me she's never seen
anybody slice apples with such grace.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.449
Not gonna lie,
she was throwing me some red hot heat.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.620
Connie Merkelson is a gay lady.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.748
But... thank you for taking Alex.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.959
And actually, I have another favor to ask.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.460
Okay, but with Connie...

12:33.544 --> 12:35.712
I think she might walk
both sides of the street.

12:35.797 --> 12:36.798
I'm gonna stay on the case.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.260
Tomorrow I'm gonna buy a car,
and so that I don't get screwed,

12:41.343 --> 12:42.887
I need a male presence
to pretend to be my--

12:42.970 --> 12:44.096
-Son?
-Really?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.145
You're older than me.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.356
I was gonna say husband.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.067
Oh! A May-December thing.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.361
Gross, but okay.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.573
[sighs] So I know you've been doing
your research.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.991
-What's our play?
-You don't talk.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.660
-Arm candy. I hear ya.
-Yeah.

13:06.743 --> 13:09.914
I'm just gonna walk up to that salesman,
I'm gonna look him in the eye,

13:09.997 --> 13:11.832
and I'm gonna say, "Here's what's up.

13:12.083 --> 13:16.087
You're gonna sell me
a 2012 pre-owned Honda CR-V,

13:16.170 --> 13:18.714
low mileage, no upsell,
for the bluebook price,

13:18.797 --> 13:20.174
or I will burn this building down!"

13:21.383 --> 13:23.970
[chuckles] Save that fire
for the bedroom, babe.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.889
You're comin' on way too strong.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.725
No, I gotta be tough.
They gotta see that I ain't no punk.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.519
They also gotta see that you didn't
just get out of a women's prison.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.234
Look, you know your stuff.
Just throw in a little charm.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.404
For example,
I have my own little secret weapon.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.323
[clears throat]

13:46.367 --> 13:47.576
Whoopsies!

13:48.077 --> 13:49.495
[clears throat]

13:52.039 --> 13:53.124
What?

13:56.668 --> 13:57.879
[Schneider grunts]

14:03.217 --> 14:06.845
Guess who just got a large latte
for the price of a small?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.432
I'm trying to buy a car,

14:10.516 --> 14:13.560
not impress a white girl with dreadlocks
who likes flat asses.

14:16.563 --> 14:19.233
I'm just saying,
I got tricks to get people on my side.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.819
What are you bringing to the table?

14:29.576 --> 14:31.913
Playing the veteran card is genius.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.331
Hey! I earned this guilt.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.625
But, yeah, I kinda feel sorry
for the salesman.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.002
[both chuckle]

14:38.085 --> 14:40.421
Beautiful lady veteran,
you're gonna own this guy.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.464
Hey, folks.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.590
I'm Jill.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.301
Can I answer any questions for you?

14:46.718 --> 14:48.054
[whispers] I got this!

14:55.937 --> 14:57.271
Whoopsie!

14:59.315 --> 15:01.067
Damn it, that's a Montblanc!

15:02.526 --> 15:04.612
-Oh, yeah...
-[Schneider grunts]

15:05.988 --> 15:06.864
That's my husband.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.783
I married him for his flat ass.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.249
I see you served.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.336
Yes, I was an army medic in Afghanistan.
Yeah... [groans loudly]

15:20.419 --> 15:22.254
[wincing] Ai, sorry, sorry!

15:23.005 --> 15:25.174
I sustained a shoulder injury
in the field.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.635
It was a difficult time,
but I'm proud to serve my country.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.846
-I hear what you're saying.
-Thank you.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.264
Sergeant Riley.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.809
I was a driver and gunner in Baghdad.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.103
Hooah!

15:41.231 --> 15:42.066
[softly] Hooah.

15:43.984 --> 15:44.818
Pardon me a second.

15:45.987 --> 15:49.031
Hey, Michaels, step away from the donuts.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.117
The customers need them
and you definitely don't.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.079
Schneider, she is not gonna
give me any sympathy.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.747
She's more badass than I am.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.125
Yeah, I got bigger fish here, Penelope.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.920
Anyway, this Honda CR-V is an LX.
It's got low mileage.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.965
Five-star safety rating, ABS--

16:06.048 --> 16:07.424
Which is different than EX,

16:07.508 --> 16:09.343
because it has smaller wheels
and no fog lights,

16:09.426 --> 16:11.220
'cause I ain't no punk!
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.471
[chuckles]

16:12.554 --> 16:14.348
Somebody's been doing their research.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.184
You know what? I am a straight shooter.
I tell it like it is.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.687
Then why are you lyin' about that guy
being your husband?

16:22.439 --> 16:23.565
What, what?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.986
Come on! You served in the Army!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.737
You've trained to rappel
out of helicopters.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.739
And you're gonna tell me
that you're married to that haircut?

16:30.822 --> 16:34.118
[Schneider] Do you guys have
one of those grabber claw thingies?

16:36.037 --> 16:37.454
We're not married, I'm sorry.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.374
It's just that my real husband and I
are actually separated

16:40.457 --> 16:42.626
and this is my first big purchase
without him.

16:42.709 --> 16:44.003
I get it.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.797
There's no reason you and I
can't figure this out, just the two of us.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.840
[Schneider] Oh, God. Spider.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.594
Spider!

17:06.192 --> 17:08.402
I'm glad we enlisted and not him.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.615
[Lydia] So,  mi niña...

17:13.699 --> 17:15.784
how was the crusade today?

17:15.867 --> 17:18.620
[sighs] Another great day on the bus.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.164
Oh, which one did you take?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.415
Uh, the 60?

17:21.498 --> 17:22.666
That goes to Vernon?

17:23.709 --> 17:25.377
Oh, my favorite butcher is there.

17:26.295 --> 17:32.218
I once saw a woman rip the weave
off another woman over a leg of lamb.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.388
It was me.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.640
[laughing]

17:39.683 --> 17:42.936
[scoffs] Well, Vernon's library is
much better than ours.

17:43.019 --> 17:44.730
My bus driver actually tipped me off.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.566
-Georgie, Miguel or Petros?
-Petros.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.151
Petros only works on weekends.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.736
Sorry, it was Miguel.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.362
There is no Miguel. I made him up.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.491
What are you doing?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.367
What are you doing?

18:01.497 --> 18:04.250
Okay! I hate the bus!

18:04.333 --> 18:05.667
Whoa, what?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.169
I'm a fraud!

18:07.253 --> 18:08.962
I've been lying these past two days.

18:09.045 --> 18:10.631
It's okay, we know!

18:12.007 --> 18:14.760
Public transportation is hard.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.429
The seats are small, it kind of smells...

18:17.513 --> 18:20.432
One time, I fell asleep
and somebody stole my socks.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.230
They left my shoes!

18:29.483 --> 18:32.068
Mi vida,  it's not that bad.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.656
Just yesterday,
I took the bus to the farmer's market

18:35.739 --> 18:39.034
and then I went to collect on some
bottles that I had saved.

18:41.162 --> 18:43.455
Wait, so you used mass transit

18:43.539 --> 18:46.458
to shop for locally grown produce
and then recycled?

18:47.334 --> 18:50.003
-That's like triple fossil fuel savings.
-Mmm.

18:50.086 --> 18:51.338
Oh, my God!

18:51.422 --> 18:53.507
Abuelita's  greener than you.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.970
[chuckles] Well,  Abuelita,
I guess you're my new hero.

18:59.054 --> 19:03.142
Ah, Elena...
I've always been your hero.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.521
Abuelita,  what's this?

19:07.604 --> 19:10.023
That is the flier for my dance classes.

19:10.106 --> 19:12.484
I've been hanging them
all over the neighborhood.

19:14.111 --> 19:18.699
"Experienced Latina will make your body
do things you didn't know it could"?

19:22.578 --> 19:24.455
What? It's true.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.336
Abuelita,  it's just the wording
is kind of provocative.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.088
As is the photo!

19:36.425 --> 19:37.426
[cell phone buzzing]

19:37.509 --> 19:39.428
Don't be  ridícula.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.140
[gasps] Oh, look, I got 58 new messages.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.769
Wow! Oh, and I got a customer.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.939
His name is Bobby...

19:51.690 --> 19:52.816
and he wants...

19:53.775 --> 19:55.068
I need to get a new phone number.

20:00.657 --> 20:02.659
Congrats on the new car, Alvarez.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.120
Oh, thank you, Riley.
I like this last name thing.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.163
Brings me back to my old Army days.

20:07.248 --> 20:10.251
You know, sometimes I'll get in early
and hang out with the mechanics

20:10.334 --> 20:12.169
just 'cause I miss the swearin' so much.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.004
I have kids.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.089
-So I totally fudgin' get that.
-[both chuckle]

20:16.172 --> 20:18.217
But seriously,
I feel like I got a really good deal.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.843
Uh, you are a tough negotiator.

20:19.926 --> 20:23.430
In all fairness,
you got a pretty great trade-in, girl.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.487
I can't believe I gave you
40 bucks for that thing.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.031
Hey, it's got a full tank of gas.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.867
The fuel gauge is broken,
so you're gonna have to trust me on that.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.370
Now, just clear out
all your personal effects

20:46.453 --> 20:47.871
and we'll get you squared away.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.665
[chuckles]

20:52.918 --> 20:55.045
Mrs. Resnick.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.519
I'm gonna miss you, old lady.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.408
Ah!  ¡Ay, carajo!

21:25.534 --> 21:26.660
[groans]

21:37.629 --> 21:38.505
[sighs]

21:46.471 --> 21:47.514
Toni...

21:54.229 --> 21:55.564
[inhales deeply]

22:08.285 --> 22:09.661
[sighs]

22:17.669 --> 22:18.670
[knocking on window]

22:18.754 --> 22:19.963
Everything all right?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.719
I can't get rid of this car.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.430
[thuds]

22:30.432 --> 22:31.767
I can see why.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.193
Talk to me, Alvarez.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.782
This was Victor's car.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.284
My soon-to-be ex.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.452
Oh.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.414
Got a lot of memories in here.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.418
We drove off on our honeymoon
in this old lady.

22:58.669 --> 23:02.506
My son was probably conceived
in the front seat or the back seat...

23:02.589 --> 23:03.507
or both.

23:04.007 --> 23:06.301
-Well, let's just say it was the back.
-[chuckles]

23:10.722 --> 23:12.390
He was an infantryman.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.227
He was a good one, too.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.399
[sniffling]

23:21.232 --> 23:22.734
[voice breaking] In fact...

23:25.153 --> 23:27.989
my husband was a really good man.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.124
He was so charming.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.127
And we were happy.

23:42.170 --> 23:45.215
You know, like one of those couples
that other couples hate being around,

23:45.298 --> 23:47.300
'cause it shows them
how not happy they are?

23:47.383 --> 23:48.719
We were that couple. [chuckles]

23:49.385 --> 23:51.346
-I hate that couple.
-[laughs]

23:53.473 --> 23:57.811
He got sent on some difficult deployments,
he saw some really tough stuff.

23:59.312 --> 24:00.856
He used to make people laugh.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.112
And after that,
I can't even remember seeing him smile.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.907
He started sleeping late, then drinking...

24:12.784 --> 24:14.202
He wouldn't get any help.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.749
Then things got really bad.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.754
And it wasn't safe in the house.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.592
[sighs sharply]

24:31.177 --> 24:36.349
Until, finally, one night,
I had to take those keys away from him...

24:37.851 --> 24:40.353
'cause he told me
he was gonna wrap himself around a tree.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.271
Mmm.

24:43.899 --> 24:44.983
That's tough.

24:46.192 --> 24:47.360
And I get it.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.156
I went through some stuff, too,
when I got back.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.741
I'm sorry to bring it up.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.993
No, I can talk about it now,
because I did get help.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.246
I'm in this women's veterans group.

24:58.329 --> 25:00.541
Lot of swearing. You'll love it.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.375
[chuckles]

25:02.458 --> 25:03.585
The hard truth is...

25:03.668 --> 25:07.047
if your husband's not trying to change,
there's nothing you can do.

25:08.339 --> 25:09.675
Trust me on that.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.726
Leaving was the right thing to do.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.397
It's just hard to say goodbye.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.778
I think it's time, Alvarez.

25:31.822 --> 25:35.450
'Cause Mrs. Resnick kind of smells
like a gas leak in Hawaii.

25:35.533 --> 25:37.160
[laughs]

25:42.373 --> 25:43.416
[chuckles] Oh, man!

25:44.000 --> 25:46.378
I haven't talked to another soldier
in a long time.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.713
-This was really nice.
-Yeah.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.924
-You should come to the group.
-Maybe I will.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.425
Yeah. Wait, wait.

25:52.508 --> 25:54.845
What's happening here?
Are we becoming friends?

It's happenin', Alvarez.

[groaning]

25:57.806 --> 25:59.724
And you can stop milking
the shoulder injury.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.017
I already sold you the car.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.352
No, this is a real injury.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.561
-Oh, sorry.
-No, it's okay.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.355
I'll tell you about it in the group.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.149
It'll be nice to talk
to a bunch of lady soldiers.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.443
-It's hard to find women who get me.
-Oh, me, too.

26:10.526 --> 26:12.237
What is wrong with civilian women?

26:12.320 --> 26:13.989
I know, right? It's like...

26:14.072 --> 26:16.074
[mocking] "Let's get mani-pedis."

26:16.157 --> 26:17.200
[laughing]

26:18.034 --> 26:19.661
But I think we should
totally get mani-pedis.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.372
Mmm-hmm. I could use a fill-in
like nobody's business.

26:22.455 --> 26:23.456
[chuckles]

26:24.666 --> 26:26.417
Is this great or is this great?

26:26.501 --> 26:29.462
Look at us all together as a family.

26:29.545 --> 26:33.549
It's just like growing up in Cuba.
[chuckles]  ¡Salud!

[grunts]

26:37.428 --> 26:39.389
I haven't even shown you guys
the best part.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.474
-Play my jam.
