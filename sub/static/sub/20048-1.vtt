00:00.840 --> 00:03.330
Spike Spiegel.

00:04.910 --> 00:06.580
l'll see you in another world.

00:06.720 --> 00:07.770
Vincent!

00:46.450 --> 00:47.570
Vincent...

00:49.120 --> 00:50.550
It's me, remember?

01:30.690 --> 01:31.490
Why only me?

01:43.910 --> 01:45.170
Vincent.

02:12.770 --> 02:14.740
Can you hear me, Spike?

02:16.570 --> 02:18.730
You almost didn't make it.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.840
He's dead.

02:22.980 --> 02:25.950
He was dead
from the beginning.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.980
Just like you.

02:53.510 --> 02:57.240
He's the one who found your body

02:57.380 --> 02:59.850
floating in the river.

03:05.990 --> 03:07.350
Thank you.

03:10.130 --> 03:12.030
What did you see?

03:12.160 --> 03:15.130
You're on the verge of death.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.430
l was dreaming.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.170
Well...

03:22.910 --> 03:24.530
Which is the dream?

03:25.640 --> 03:26.940
The first time ever...

03:27.840 --> 03:30.780
First time l've been truly scared.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.010
Shaking with fear.

03:35.020 --> 03:38.180
If one single atom had given way,

03:39.760 --> 03:41.250
l would have died.

03:43.390 --> 03:48.190
It was not destined to be
your time to die.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.240
Swimming Bird...

03:56.240 --> 03:59.970
These blue eyes see everything.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.510
They see the past,
the present and the future.

04:05.580 --> 04:09.570
They look upon
the full flow of time.

04:10.120 --> 04:13.050
They see not the reality,

04:13.190 --> 04:16.250
they see only the truth.

04:17.829 --> 04:20.420
Open your eyes to truth.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.830
There is nothing to fear.

04:26.300 --> 04:29.600
Yes...
...I understand.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.990
So you're not dead?

04:55.330 --> 04:58.560
What about Vincent?

05:00.170 --> 05:01.800
He disappeared.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.900
As if he was never
there at all.

05:07.510 --> 05:11.500
We've gotten mixed up
in something fatal.

05:13.550 --> 05:15.920
As my father always said,

05:16.150 --> 05:18.350
"The ship that sets sail"

05:18.490 --> 05:22.180
"either keeps sailing,
or it sinks."

05:23.290 --> 05:25.990
We're just bounty hunters.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.160
This is far too big
for the likes of us.

05:30.870 --> 05:32.770
We can still quit now.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.360
We should back off.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.040
Okay, Spike?

05:44.580 --> 05:46.910
He can sleep anywhere.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.120
Why did you disobey orders?

05:55.390 --> 05:57.360
You don't wish to answer?

05:57.960 --> 06:01.120
Did you consider that
disobeying orders

06:01.260 --> 06:04.960
was the direct cause of
so many innocent deaths?

06:06.100 --> 06:07.500
l'm very sorry.

06:08.170 --> 06:11.110
You're restricted to barracks
as of now.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.340
l'll give my final decision
at a later date.

06:24.150 --> 06:25.920
Watch her closely.

06:27.260 --> 06:31.720
Our investigation shows
the element used on the monorail

06:31.890 --> 06:35.890
is the same as that
from the tanker truck.

06:36.570 --> 06:40.300
Have you managed
to identify that element?

06:40.440 --> 06:42.160
We're doing it now.

06:42.400 --> 06:45.860
The hacking of our computers
was carried out

06:46.010 --> 06:51.070
by one Lee Samson,
with a similar MO in a previous attack.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.610
We're running a trace
on his path of access.

06:54.920 --> 06:57.890
Any chance he's their leader?

06:58.020 --> 06:58.990
Yes, there is.

06:59.220 --> 07:03.210
We believe he has had
contact with terrorist groups.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.220
What is their aim?

07:05.390 --> 07:08.800
Is it ideological,
or do they want money?

07:10.070 --> 07:11.730
We're still checking.

07:12.330 --> 07:16.070
Is everything still
"being checked"?

07:16.510 --> 07:18.130
How long must we wait?

07:18.270 --> 07:21.500
The medicals should be
ready by now!

07:38.030 --> 07:40.360
l feel so heavy...

07:40.500 --> 07:41.520
What's that?

07:41.860 --> 07:43.890
My legs feel heavy.

07:44.830 --> 07:45.600
Hey!

07:45.870 --> 07:47.890
l got it!

07:49.840 --> 07:55.800
Circle's an eye ball
Circles are pretty

07:55.880 --> 08:02.210
A wonderful taste
just like black grapes

08:02.280 --> 08:05.280
l hacked into Cherious Medical.

08:05.790 --> 08:09.480
Check their trucking records
for October 15.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.120
Back on the job, Spike?

08:13.260 --> 08:15.990
No way.
l'm just checking up.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.500
Otherwise, l can't sleep.

08:19.070 --> 08:20.800
You sleep too much.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.309
Truck, truck,
where have you been?

08:33.450 --> 08:36.650
It carried a load
of macadamia nuts.

08:36.789 --> 08:38.510
Macadamia nuts?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.520
l wouldn't try to eat 'em.

08:40.659 --> 08:42.559
l'll check it out.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.230
"Macadamia Nuts Control Dept."

08:45.290 --> 08:48.090
"Macadamia Nuts R&D Dept."

08:48.400 --> 08:51.390
Why such attention to mere nuts?

08:51.630 --> 08:54.530
Ed, take a look into
the R&D Dept.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.210
Any clues to what they're doing?

09:05.280 --> 09:07.750
My hacking program has crashed.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.040
Now?
We were so close.

09:10.190 --> 09:13.810
Try another route
and get a profile on him.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.980
Dr. Mendelo al Hedia.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.930
At SIT he was researching
nano machines.

09:24.070 --> 09:27.520
There's no way
that's a drug company.

09:27.670 --> 09:30.330
They're developing nano war machines
for the military.

09:30.410 --> 09:34.000
And Vincent got his hand on 'em,
a guy who was listed as dead.

09:34.540 --> 09:39.810
But nano war machines were banned
by the Treaty of Amsterdam.

09:40.150 --> 09:45.110
If Vincent is plotting something, the
military would do anything to stop him.

09:45.890 --> 09:48.450
And yet, he's still alive.

10:13.950 --> 10:15.110
Hello, Steve.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.750
What can l do for you, Electra?

10:22.920 --> 10:25.390
What's that?
A blood sample?

10:26.260 --> 10:28.250
Check it out for me.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.530
Okay, if you agree to a date.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.000
Well, okay.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.900
l'll reserve a table
for Halloween night.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.710
What's going on?

11:14.710 --> 11:16.800
Why am l still alive?

11:18.450 --> 11:20.310
What did you do to me?

11:22.420 --> 11:24.150
l gave you my blood.

11:26.450 --> 11:29.820
Now you won't die
when l unleash the power.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.160
Just like me.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.320
It won't be much longer now.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.400
Did you find what you wanted?

11:52.650 --> 11:55.170
No, just a lot of things
l don't need.

11:55.550 --> 11:57.780
That's how the world turns.

11:57.920 --> 12:02.120
There are people who make things
we'll never want.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.860
Who's making these demons?

12:10.500 --> 12:12.560
Why did you give me that vase?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.990
It was perfect for you.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.630
l mean what was inside.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.000
Nano machines in the form
of lymph corpuscles.

12:21.180 --> 12:22.370
Dr. Mendelo's.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.880
A man escaped here
over three years ago.

12:33.690 --> 12:38.280
He said he had made
a hideous development.

12:39.390 --> 12:43.300
One that's programmed
to spread through touch,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.800
or through the atmosphere.

12:46.530 --> 12:50.270
In the blood, it assumes
the form of lymph corpuscles,

12:50.340 --> 12:52.600
and endlessly replicates.

12:53.310 --> 12:56.470
Until it reaches the brain
and destroys it.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.310
Then it turns to protein
and exits the body,

13:01.450 --> 13:03.850
leaving no trace at all.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.820
That's as much as l know.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.620
There's only one thing
l want to know.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.690
How come Vincent's still alive?

13:20.240 --> 13:22.670
What are you trying to do?

13:23.970 --> 13:27.340
Are you doing this for money,
for revenge?

13:27.480 --> 13:30.100
Or is it just a game to you?

13:30.950 --> 13:35.180
l am only trying to find the door.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.240
The door?

13:37.750 --> 13:41.780
Have you ever had a dream
where you're aware

13:42.160 --> 13:46.460
that you are in the middle
of a dream but can't wake up?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.090
That's when it started.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.330
From when l was still on Titan.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.770
Vincent was a guinea pig.

13:59.270 --> 14:04.230
He injected an anti-nano machine
into Vincent's blood.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.010
Anti-nano machine?

14:07.920 --> 14:10.890
It replicates like nano machines.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.550
It destroys nano machines.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.720
It was a vaccine experiment.

14:17.790 --> 14:22.160
Vincent started it.
Only he can stop it.

14:23.470 --> 14:25.700
But we don't know his motive.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.430
Maybe he doesn't have one.

14:28.570 --> 14:33.200
Perhaps Vincent is just waiting
for Judgment Day.

14:35.510 --> 14:38.740
Doesn't Dr. Mendelo have everything?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.410
Nano machines, the vaccine?

14:42.520 --> 14:47.610
He disappeared and deleted
all the data from his computer.

14:47.790 --> 14:52.660
He never imagined anyone
could use his discovery.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.650
He disappeared without a trace.

14:58.970 --> 15:02.030
No one can stop Vincent.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.240
l lost two things on Titan.

15:07.710 --> 15:09.510
One was my past.

15:12.050 --> 15:17.140
There were no opposing armies
in that battle.

15:17.290 --> 15:21.650
They were all killed to test
the nano machines as weapons.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.650
l was used as a guinea pig.

15:25.760 --> 15:28.350
The only one who survived.

15:29.430 --> 15:32.990
l lost all memories of my early life.

15:33.970 --> 15:37.230
l didn't even know who l was.

15:39.240 --> 15:41.440
What was the other?

15:41.780 --> 15:43.610
Did you see the butterflies?

15:45.580 --> 15:48.140
l saw countless butterflies.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.320
So many, so very beautiful.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.820
When the nano machines reach
the brain, a light is seen.

16:05.670 --> 16:07.330
It's as if...

16:08.170 --> 16:11.260
... it's the most beautiful sight
in the world.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.540
l've talked too long.

16:25.490 --> 16:29.790
Rashid, please give this to the doctor.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.190
Should you happen to meet him.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.820
Yes, l will.

16:46.140 --> 16:48.970
Okay then, Inshallah!

17:09.359 --> 17:11.530
What's this all about, huh?

17:11.970 --> 17:15.730
We're the ones
who'd like an explanation.

17:16.099 --> 17:19.800
Why does your blood have
the anti-nano machines?

17:21.440 --> 17:24.410
How did this escape our attention?

17:25.180 --> 17:30.350
We thought only Vincent had it.
How did you get it?

17:30.620 --> 17:32.380
Have you contacted him?

17:34.360 --> 17:37.150
We'll place you in protective custody.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.350
If l have the vaccine in my body,

17:40.500 --> 17:43.690
can't we use it to
protect the population?

17:43.970 --> 17:46.090
You just don't get it.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.060
Our sole purpose is

17:49.140 --> 17:53.470
to completely destroy all record
of the nano machines.

17:53.910 --> 17:57.940
With no records,
they never existed.

18:10.190 --> 18:10.950
Hi.

18:18.230 --> 18:22.730
What is the bond
that ties us all together?

18:24.140 --> 18:26.770
It's not as if we're family.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.370
There's no linking bond like that.

18:29.980 --> 18:34.070
We each go our own way
and do as we please.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.020
They give me so much trouble.

18:37.890 --> 18:42.120
l've had enough.
l want to be alone again.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.630
One more move and l win.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.160
Hey, leave them alone.

19:09.880 --> 19:14.120
But does it matter?
So what if they don't come back?

19:15.460 --> 19:17.250
The toss of a coin.

19:18.190 --> 19:22.750
If it had come up tails,
l would've asked you on a date.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.660
Nothing special, mind you.

19:28.370 --> 19:29.630
Aren't you scared?

19:29.770 --> 19:30.930
Scared?

19:32.070 --> 19:36.700
They'll either kill us
or wipe out our memories.

19:37.680 --> 19:40.740
We'll lose our identities, anyway.

19:42.020 --> 19:44.580
We'll be like the living dead.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.450
Like Vincent?

19:48.460 --> 19:51.820
The reason you survived
the attack is because

19:51.960 --> 19:53.820
you have them in you.

19:54.030 --> 19:57.660
That, what is it?
Nano machine vaccine?

19:58.070 --> 19:59.760
You know everything.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.930
It's like you said.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.840
Knowing too much
can shorten my life.

20:08.310 --> 20:12.680
You're no ordinary bounty hunter,
Spike Spiegel.

20:12.910 --> 20:15.780
You're too good to be just a soldier.

20:16.780 --> 20:20.020
My name is Electra Ovilo.

20:21.090 --> 20:22.250
So, now l know.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.290
It's a strong name.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.900
l didn't know l had them
inside my body.

20:43.340 --> 20:44.830
Vincent was...

20:46.050 --> 20:49.710
...poor Vincent was all alone from birth.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.680
All he had, as a boy,
was hate and the will to fight.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.620
No one has ever loved him.

20:59.560 --> 21:02.960
That's why l wanted to help him.

21:04.030 --> 21:08.090
l thought l could,
but l was very wrong.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.530
Back there,
on the monorail,

21:13.170 --> 21:16.440
he looked at me
as if he didn't know me.

21:17.910 --> 21:20.750
He had forgotten all about me.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.180
Did you love him?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.520
l don't know.

21:29.860 --> 21:33.950
Have you ever experienced
a brand-new feeling

21:34.630 --> 21:38.590
that welled up inside
your heart and filled you

21:39.000 --> 21:41.490
with indescribable pain?

21:43.140 --> 21:44.100
Yes, l have.

21:46.910 --> 21:50.470
Maybe l was looking to be saved.

21:51.650 --> 21:55.980
Years ago,
back when l was much younger,

21:57.750 --> 22:00.020
l was afraid of nothing.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.350
l had not the slightest
fear of death.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.250
l was ready to die anytime.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.720
But then l met a special woman.

22:11.870 --> 22:15.270
She made me want to go on living.

22:15.970 --> 22:19.630
For the first time,
l was afraid of death.

22:20.410 --> 22:22.810
A feeling l'd never had before.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.910
Where is she now?

22:28.250 --> 22:30.150
She went away.

22:32.890 --> 22:37.790
You're the first person
l can talk to like this.

22:40.230 --> 22:42.630
What's between you and Vincent?

22:43.130 --> 22:45.890
We share similar souls.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.060
That's why l must find him.

23:11.030 --> 23:15.460
He said his name was Spike,
didn't he?

23:18.270 --> 23:21.390
So, he's a friend of yours?

23:22.140 --> 23:26.130
How do you know?
What do you plan to do?

23:26.870 --> 23:29.870
l came here to finish it.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.940
The final party begins.

23:35.320 --> 23:38.410
My next trick is
special nano machines.

23:39.320 --> 23:44.450
These will not self-destruct,
they will multiply until...

23:45.190 --> 23:47.790
You plan to destroy the world?

23:48.530 --> 23:51.930
You...
...you're insane.

23:52.370 --> 23:53.800
You think so?

23:55.340 --> 23:58.700
Who decides where to draw
the line of insanity?

23:59.770 --> 24:03.540
Aren't there those
who cross and recross the line?

24:04.510 --> 24:06.310
Soon you will understand.

24:07.550 --> 24:10.850
It's not me.
The rest of the world is insane.

24:12.890 --> 24:14.290
Will you join me?

24:16.790 --> 24:19.590
We'll be the only ones left alive.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.520
Don't be ridiculous!

24:21.860 --> 24:25.860
l don't know what will happen,
but l don't want that.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.350
Do it by yourself.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.430
Vincent!

24:57.570 --> 24:59.860
l said never to come here.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.770
Everything is ready to go.

25:03.370 --> 25:07.400
l want to get away.
The cops are closing in.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.100
Pay me what you owe me.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.040
Have you prayed?

25:29.860 --> 25:33.960
l'll be at the bridge
connecting this world to Heaven.

25:34.840 --> 25:39.740
You can watch it all alone
from Purgatory.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.050
What will happen to me?

25:54.790 --> 25:57.990
You're a soldier,
you're prepared for it.

26:02.930 --> 26:06.130
Do l get a cigarette?
One will do.

26:06.530 --> 26:07.520
- Shall I, sir?
- Ignore him.

26:13.540 --> 26:16.140
No, don't shoot!

26:16.280 --> 26:19.270
Throw down the gun.
Open the door.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.110
l'll have these.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.290
Where are they?

26:30.420 --> 26:31.760
At the waterworks.

26:32.360 --> 26:37.090
l tracked Lee's hack route
to the waterworks.

26:37.330 --> 26:41.670
So he plans to put it
into the city's water supply.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.930
The anti-terrorist squad.

26:46.040 --> 26:47.300
That'll fix him!

26:47.510 --> 26:49.980
Don't we need permission?

26:50.540 --> 26:53.840
If we don't,
there'll be serious trouble.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.010
This is a no-smoking area.

26:58.690 --> 27:02.620
If we go through channels,
we'll run out of time!

27:11.900 --> 27:13.730
We've got a job to do.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.330
Where's your blood sample?

27:21.080 --> 27:21.970
This way.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.210
It's open.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.610
- Protective suits?
- No time.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.110
They're behind us.

27:35.790 --> 27:37.720
Where's Electra's vaccine?

27:38.360 --> 27:42.890
It's being cultured in number 3,
no, number 2 case.

27:43.230 --> 27:43.920
Is this it?

27:44.060 --> 27:46.660
The yellow packs.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.860
l'm not lying,
but it's not finished yet.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.240
In 20 hours,
each pack will have 100,000 units.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.210
l'm sorry, Electra.

28:03.650 --> 28:06.350
You can get out
through level three.

28:07.660 --> 28:08.710
Thanks.

28:11.560 --> 28:13.050
So no date, l guess.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.440
Who are you?

29:05.610 --> 29:08.640
ISSP.
We're taking over here.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.780
l've had no such orders.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.250
We ask your cooperation.

29:17.390 --> 29:20.660
l can't let anyone
see me like this.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.800
Rest in peace.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.740
Waiting for a call?

29:32.870 --> 29:35.400
No, not particularly.

29:36.110 --> 29:39.140
Aren't you waiting
for Spike to call?

29:39.310 --> 29:43.940
What?
l didn't notice them leave.

29:46.190 --> 29:46.850
Hello?

29:47.660 --> 29:49.150
Vincent has gone.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.420
Where the hell have you been?

29:52.560 --> 29:56.460
He's planning a very nasty
Halloween party.

29:56.630 --> 29:58.830
How do you know that?

29:59.270 --> 30:00.430
Spike!

30:00.600 --> 30:03.970
You idiot!
Where the hell were you?

30:04.570 --> 30:07.510
ISSP are headed for the waterworks.

30:07.740 --> 30:08.710
City waterworks?

30:38.310 --> 30:41.170
No. 2 gate all clear, sir.

30:41.310 --> 30:44.640
No. 3 tank shows
no abnormalities, sir.

30:44.810 --> 30:48.440
A suspicious object
near the gate to no. 4 plant.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.710
Bomb squad on the way.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.790
Object appears to be...

30:54.660 --> 30:57.280
... a pumpkin-shaped balloon.

31:01.900 --> 31:06.160
That's strange.
Why is he dressed like a warlock?

31:06.830 --> 31:10.360
There's a Halloween costume
parade in Alva City.

31:10.540 --> 31:13.130
So he wants to blend in?

31:13.270 --> 31:16.610
He'll do it in the middle of town?
But how?

31:16.740 --> 31:20.270
His accomplice said
Jack was in place.

31:20.410 --> 31:21.180
Jack...?

31:22.450 --> 31:23.680
Yes, l see.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.950
Jack-o'-lantern?

31:28.090 --> 31:30.110
Yes, a Halloween lamp.

31:32.230 --> 31:33.630
We're starting now.

31:49.780 --> 31:50.870
What's that?

32:12.300 --> 32:13.930
Unit A, report!

32:14.170 --> 32:17.540
Damn it!
Find out what's going on.

32:19.410 --> 32:20.460
- Sir!
- What is it?

32:22.010 --> 32:23.740
It's the army, sir.

32:25.480 --> 32:27.240
- Damn!
- Sir!

32:29.120 --> 32:30.610
Who's in charge?

32:30.950 --> 32:33.720
Who ordered the army
to take over?

32:33.920 --> 32:35.350
That's classified.

32:37.090 --> 32:38.850
We're in charge now.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.860
What gives you the right?

32:40.990 --> 32:42.290
National emergency.

32:42.430 --> 32:43.420
A what!?

32:43.630 --> 32:45.060
Test results are in.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.700
Hurry up, tell me.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.970
l told you to leave!

32:53.940 --> 32:58.500
It's composed of nitrogen,
oxygen, and carbon dioxide,

32:58.650 --> 33:00.640
with traces of argon,
neon and krypton.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.410
It's air, sir.

33:09.660 --> 33:13.490
But the town will be full
of jack-o'-lanterns.

33:13.630 --> 33:17.320
He said he'd be at the bridge
joining here to Heaven.

33:17.460 --> 33:18.450
What's that mean?

33:18.730 --> 33:22.170
Jet, we need 20-30 aircraft
as soon as possible.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.240
What are you planning to do?

33:25.370 --> 33:26.900
l'll take Swordfish.

33:27.110 --> 33:28.730
Wait a minute.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.050
Faye, go to the
weather control center.

33:37.180 --> 33:38.910
Hey, not so fast.

33:39.350 --> 33:43.150
You can't beat Vincent.
He's indestructible.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.290
We have unfinished business.

33:45.430 --> 33:46.520
It's a waste of time!

33:47.360 --> 33:51.820
If he wanted to destroy the world,
he'd have done it.

33:52.670 --> 33:57.190
This invitation says the party
won't start without the guest.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.770
If you don't go,
the party won't start.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.570
Go for it!

34:07.950 --> 34:09.940
Only death cures stupidity!

34:16.620 --> 34:19.110
The army. What a nuisance!

34:41.080 --> 34:43.710
l've got no time to play with you!

35:31.900 --> 35:34.960
It's an emergency,
we need help!

35:35.100 --> 35:37.160
But we have rules...

35:37.900 --> 35:42.640
All our fighter jets are
at the air show celebration.

35:42.780 --> 35:46.800
There's no time.
Anything that can fly will do!

35:49.150 --> 35:50.710
You said anything?

36:04.400 --> 36:06.160
It's too early to start the party.

37:45.530 --> 37:49.260
They made good planes
back in those days.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.830
Can they actually fly?

37:54.510 --> 37:58.410
We'll have no trouble
spraying the vaccine for you.

37:58.550 --> 38:01.310
Don't overdo it, old fella.

38:01.450 --> 38:03.940
Where are we headed?
Saturn?

38:04.150 --> 38:07.920
No, we're going to vaccinate
the city to save it.

38:08.190 --> 38:11.090
We're only going as far as Alva City.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.820
l was just kidding!

38:32.810 --> 38:35.680
They really can fly!

38:36.850 --> 38:42.190
They're all museum pieces,
haven't been flown for decades.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.240
Don't give up now!

40:35.570 --> 40:37.060
Taxi!

40:39.210 --> 40:41.230
Who's in charge?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.970
Who are you?

40:44.950 --> 40:48.380
As you can see,
l'm just a terrorist.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.480
What do you want here?

40:54.620 --> 40:56.250
Your demands?

40:56.520 --> 40:58.460
l want it to rain.

40:58.530 --> 41:00.460
Rain?
What for?

41:01.360 --> 41:02.760
Well, how about...

41:03.930 --> 41:05.450
...rain on the parade?

42:31.690 --> 42:33.520
This is hopeless.

42:34.250 --> 42:37.310
The parade is tying up
traffic everywhere.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.130
The bridge to Heaven?

42:49.040 --> 42:51.230
You forgot to pay!

44:02.840 --> 44:05.000
Has the party begun?

44:07.250 --> 44:08.980
It's just starting.

44:16.090 --> 44:20.150
Reminds me of
the sinking of the Bismarck.

44:20.490 --> 44:24.020
You old liar,
that was back in WWII.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.830
We're almost there.
Get ready.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.910
l knew you'd come,
bounty hunter.

45:19.720 --> 45:23.420
Last time,
l decided to miss the fatal spot.

45:24.590 --> 45:27.690
Your eyes are more
than empty holes.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.690
Come to save the world, have you?

46:39.430 --> 46:41.590
You're too late for that.

46:42.300 --> 46:46.100
Sorry, l'm just a bounty hunter.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.670
It ain't none of my business.

46:49.440 --> 46:53.140
l'm only here
to get revenge on you.

46:53.950 --> 46:57.380
You think this is just a threat?
l will do it.

46:57.720 --> 46:58.840
Go ahead.

48:48.030 --> 48:50.890
Before you die,
tell me one thing.

48:52.130 --> 48:55.120
l died up there on Titan.

48:55.900 --> 49:00.930
Is this world the one the butterflies
showed me in the dream?

49:02.310 --> 49:06.210
Or is that world
the actual reality?

49:06.980 --> 49:09.740
And my world just a dream?

49:12.050 --> 49:14.020
l don't understand.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.380
Vincent!

49:19.660 --> 49:22.420
You won't get away this time.

49:26.870 --> 49:29.600
No.
Stay back, Electra...

49:31.540 --> 49:34.270
Shall we go?
Together?

49:48.250 --> 49:50.020
Vincent!

49:54.160 --> 49:57.320
Why didn't you shoot?

49:59.470 --> 50:04.160
l remembered,
she was the one l loved.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.200
l wanted to escape from here.

50:10.740 --> 50:14.650
l searched for the door
out of this world.

50:15.950 --> 50:20.910
But now l understand,
there is no door.

50:22.390 --> 50:24.220
You should've known.

50:24.960 --> 50:28.830
You were frightened
to open your eyes and see.

50:29.230 --> 50:32.360
Ah, Electra...

50:33.170 --> 50:37.300
The time l spent
together with you

50:37.440 --> 50:39.600
was my only reality.

50:44.310 --> 50:48.580
l'm so glad we could
meet again at the end.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.270
What did the rain do?

51:12.100 --> 51:15.970
It spread the vaccine
much faster

51:16.110 --> 51:18.510
than the nano machines
could act.

51:19.510 --> 51:22.500
Do you think there'll be a rainbow?

51:23.420 --> 51:24.510
So...

51:25.420 --> 51:27.010
Want to go to the races?

51:29.860 --> 51:32.050
You never learn, do you?

55:18.150 --> 55:22.050
Directed by
Shinichiro Watanabe

55:22.660 --> 55:26.220
He was always alone,
always by himself.

55:27.890 --> 55:30.920
Never anyone to share the game.

55:32.130 --> 55:34.000
He lived in another world.

55:35.470 --> 55:37.230
He was that kinda guy.
