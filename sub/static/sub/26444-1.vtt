We can't wait to say hi to him.

Now we get to have our snack, Spike.

03:12.902 --> 03:14.070
Uh-huh.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.907
First you have to wash your mittens off.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.575
Why?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.995
Because it's important to have clean hands

when you eat your snack.

Wow! You know everything!

Cleo, you are doing a great job

03:31.753 --> 03:33.130
helping Spike.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.887
Why is snack time called
snack time?

03:39.970 --> 03:42.515
Because it's the time we eat our snacks.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.810
Why are snacks called snacks?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.855
Oh... um... because

03:48.938 --> 03:51.398
they're not breakfast, lunch
or dinner.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.735
Hey, Spike! Want to go outside?

03:54.277 --> 03:55.570
What do we do outside?

03:56.112 --> 03:57.780
We get to play

03:57.863 --> 04:01.158
and we get to really practice
our monster powers.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.748

04:12.878 --> 04:14.213
I still beat you!

04:14.297 --> 04:17.175
Spike, you're not supposed
to run up the slide.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.383
Why not?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.845
Well... It's called a slide

04:20.970 --> 04:23.138
because you slide down it.

04:23.723 --> 04:25.933
Sliding down is fun!

04:26.017 --> 04:28.185
But how come I can't walk back up?

04:29.562 --> 04:30.563
Well...

04:30.647 --> 04:33.315
Going up a slide is doing it backwards.

04:33.650 --> 04:37.445
Then you might get stuck
doing everything else backwards too.

04:37.695 --> 04:38.947
Backwards?

04:40.323 --> 04:41.323
Really?

04:42.242 --> 04:43.492
Maybe.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.868
It sounds like fun.

isn't as good as my frontwards.

Thanks for trying to help me
to answer Spike's questions.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.998
Maybe going backwards
wasn't such a good idea.

05:32.167 --> 05:34.668
Spike sure has a lot of questions.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.672
I told him I'd know all the answers.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.967
Don't worry, Cleo.
You do know a lot.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.177
And Spike's really having fun.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.638
It's OK if we don't know
the really real answers

05:46.722 --> 05:48.975
to all of Spike's questions. Right?

05:49.058 --> 05:52.270
I think so.
We're just playing pretend.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.230
But Spike expects me to know
all the answers.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.898
I can't let him down.

05:56.982 --> 05:59.152
Cleo, where do doorknobs come from?

06:03.865 --> 06:06.075
Well... Um...

06:10.913 --> 06:12.707
Do you see that gargoyle, Spike?

06:12.790 --> 06:16.877
Gargoyles sneeze doorknobs
in their sleep,

06:17.212 --> 06:21.090
the doorknobs fall on the ground.
Then they are gathered up and go on doors.

-Uh-huh.

Spike's first night of preschool.

gargoyles don't sneeze doorknobs!

08:12.702 --> 08:15.287
I wonder where basketball hoops
come from?

08:21.002 --> 08:24.088
Let's see.
First you dig a hole.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.467
Then you plant the basketball.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.810
Maybe it would help
if we had some water.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.690
All right, Super Monsters.

a basketball hoop from a basketball?

08:52.867 --> 08:54.660
No, I did not know that.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.497
I learned lots of fun things tonight!

08:57.580 --> 09:00.958
Did you know you'll be all backwards
if you walk up a slide?

09:01.042 --> 09:03.252
Gargoyles sneeze doorknobs!

09:03.377 --> 09:05.588
Leaf elves make leaves pretty.

09:05.922 --> 09:07.172
Oh!

Every time I have a question,
Cleo has a super fun answer!

Really?

09:14.347 --> 09:15.513
Well...

09:16.098 --> 09:18.892
Maybe there aren't any actual leaf elves.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.647
Basketball hoops don't really grow
from basketballs

09:22.897 --> 09:24.107
or grow at all.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.283
I should have told you
when I didn't know the real answers.

09:34.367 --> 09:37.202
But I didn't want to ruin your first night
of preschool.

09:37.787 --> 09:40.163
Well... maybe all your answers

09:40.247 --> 09:41.957
weren't really real.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.708
But they were really fun.

because that means you're just like me.

09:49.173 --> 09:51.425
I don't know all the answers either.

This is our new Super Monster,
Spike.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.472
Well! Hello, Spike!

13:25.555 --> 13:28.475
Welcome to the Natural History Museum.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.768
Thanks!

13:29.852 --> 13:32.187
This is my very first field trip.

13:32.395 --> 13:37.025
I hope tonight's game will help make
your first field trip really special.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.235
A game?

13:38.735 --> 13:40.612
It's called a scavenger hunt.

13:41.030 --> 13:43.990
You'll need to use your noggins
and your special talents

13:44.115 --> 13:48.162
to find these creatures hidden
in their natural habitats.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.747
Is that a ferret?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.542
Right you are, Cleo.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.418
That's my pet ferret, Fluffy.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.087
She got out of her cage earlier today.

13:58.297 --> 14:00.883
It sure would be helpful
if you could help me find her!

14:00.967 --> 14:03.593
[all]
Sure, we'll help!

14:03.677 --> 14:05.095
Thank you, everyone.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.180
Now you can play this game in teams

14:07.263 --> 14:08.723
or own your own.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.560
Esmie, I need to win this scavenger hunt

14:11.643 --> 14:14.103
and show everybody
that I can play a game

14:14.187 --> 14:17.107
without making any mistakes
and spoiling it.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.108
That's a very good goal, Spike.

14:19.485 --> 14:22.528
Remember the most important part
of the game

14:22.613 --> 14:25.323
is for you to have fun
exploring the museum.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.285
Happy hunting, Super Monsters!

14:31.580 --> 14:33.623
With my fang-tastic flying skills

14:34.040 --> 14:36.127
I'll find these clues in no time!

14:37.628 --> 14:40.172
-Katya, want to be partners?
-OK.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.092
Stick with me, Zoe.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.843
Do you want to team up with me,
Spike?

14:46.303 --> 14:47.847
I do! I do!

14:48.972 --> 14:50.432
A blue butterfly!

14:50.515 --> 14:53.435
I know where the butterflies are!
Come on!

14:56.147 --> 14:58.565
Whatever you do, don't sneeze.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.985
That's what happened the last time
I was here.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.405
There were 14 butterflies in the exhibit

15:04.697 --> 15:07.700
but only one blue spotted butterfly.

15:12.705 --> 15:14.038
Frankie, look!

15:16.875 --> 15:19.587
You found it! Way to go, Spike!

15:27.970 --> 15:29.513
Hey! Where are you going?

15:29.597 --> 15:31.515
To look for more clues!

15:33.267 --> 15:35.477
[Frankie]
Stay, stay!

15:36.187 --> 15:38.022
[Frankie counts in a whisper]

15:38.605 --> 15:41.192
Phew. Fourteen butterflies.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.608
They're all still here.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.990
-Find anything, Drac?
-Not yet.

15:49.073 --> 15:53.078
I'm pretty sure I saw a baby seal statue
the last time we were here.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.165
Maybe I just need a better view.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.840
-Much better.
-[Spike] Not fair.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.592
I want to see too.

16:09.887 --> 16:13.307
Relax, little dear. This scavenger hunt
is supposed to be fun.

16:14.392 --> 16:16.727
It will be fun when I win!

16:22.565 --> 16:24.192
There it is!

16:24.275 --> 16:27.112
-Good job, Spike!
-Yahoo!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.408
All right.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.037
Gotcha!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.080
Good luck!

16:38.165 --> 16:39.458
Was it something I said?

16:39.792 --> 16:42.377
Don't be afraid to touch things
while you look.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.632
Remember:
This room is a hands-on exhibit.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.768
I give up. I felt for sure

16:58.852 --> 17:01.105
this was where we'd find
the Arctic fox.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.190
Keep searching, Super Monsters!

17:03.273 --> 17:05.108
The Arctic may be chilly,

17:05.442 --> 17:07.652
but you're getting warmer!

17:08.737 --> 17:10.030
It's not in here.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.240
Sorry!

17:12.198 --> 17:15.368
Maybe the fox is hiding
under all this snow.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.205
Good thinking, Spike.
Let's find out.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.375
[Zoe]
There it is!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.293
Wow! That's three!

17:25.045 --> 17:26.630
Two more and I win!

17:28.632 --> 17:29.883
Coming through!

17:31.008 --> 17:32.468
Wow!

17:35.930 --> 17:39.685
Whoa! I remember that dinosaur
from the last time we were here.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.437
Me too! Spike, say hello

17:42.520 --> 17:44.482
to Dippy the diplodocus.

17:45.023 --> 17:47.733
Wow! Hello, Dippy.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.945
I don't think that's Dippy
in the picture.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.240
I wonder where these guys are.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.993
If they're in here, I'll find them.

17:59.538 --> 18:02.748
Hey, Spike! It looks like you're flying
in the clouds.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.793
I can make more clouds too.

18:06.712 --> 18:08.088
[Lobo]
Oh! cool!

18:12.843 --> 18:14.762
[Katya]
Lobo, is that you?

18:15.053 --> 18:17.763
[Lobo] I can't see.
Where are you, guys?

18:18.223 --> 18:20.058
Is everything all right in here?

18:21.058 --> 18:23.228
Don't worry. I've got this.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.858
Oh! look!

18:29.067 --> 18:30.902
I found the dinosaurs!

18:31.278 --> 18:32.445
Yeah!

18:32.528 --> 18:34.322
Nice one!

18:35.907 --> 18:38.160
So... no one has seen Fluffy?

18:38.743 --> 18:40.037
I wonder where she's hiding?

18:40.120 --> 18:42.288
I bet if we all work together,

18:42.372 --> 18:44.207
we can find Fluffy super fast.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.502
If we find her together,

18:46.585 --> 18:48.295
then who wins the game?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.632
Nobody wins. It's a tie.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.800
But I really want to win.

18:54.008 --> 18:56.093
Winning can be fun.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.557
Working together to find Fluffy
can be fun too.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.350
Come on, Super Monsters.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.102
Let's go find that ferret!

19:03.352 --> 19:05.603
[all]
Yeah!

19:06.020 --> 19:07.230
Where did Spike go?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.315
Fluffy, Fluffy.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.318
Fluffy, where are you?

19:14.070 --> 19:17.032
Hey, Spike. Do you want to look for Fluffy
with us?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.868
No thanks. I want to find her first.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.495
-All right.
-Have fun.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.828
Hope you find her.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.918
Here, Fluffy, Fluffy!

19:34.257 --> 19:37.093
Look like a butterfly,
dance like a Super Monster.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.183
Are you sure you don't want
to search with us, Spike?

19:44.267 --> 19:45.393
Thanks, Zoe.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.105
But I'm pretty sure
I can find Fluffy by myself.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.982
OK. Good luck!

19:54.152 --> 19:56.280
If I can find Fluffy first

19:56.363 --> 19:58.157
then I'll win the game.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.742
[ferret squeals]

20:01.868 --> 20:02.995
Not there.

20:03.078 --> 20:04.120
Nope.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.663
Not there either.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.042
No Fluffy here.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.002
We've looked everywhere.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.503
Not everywhere.

20:12.922 --> 20:15.465
Fluffy must be in here somewhere.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.717
It's like I can almost feel it.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.095
Uh... Spike.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.432
-Right there!
-[Cleo] No, the other way.

20:23.515 --> 20:24.892
[Frankie]
There she is.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.770
-Spike!
-I see her.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.197
[all cheer]
Fluffy!

20:41.700 --> 20:44.535
There you are, little Fluffy!

20:44.828 --> 20:46.037
What's wrong, Spike?

20:46.497 --> 20:48.415
Aren't you excited you found Fluffy?

20:48.748 --> 20:52.502
I didn't really find her. You guys did.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.672
I wanted to win the scavenger hunt

20:55.755 --> 20:58.967
so that you would see I could play a game
without messing up.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.345
And you'd think I was super...

21:01.637 --> 21:03.055
just like all of you.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.848
We already think you're super.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.267
You know, Spike?

21:07.350 --> 21:10.437
All the games we play are just things
we do to have fun together.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.438
It doesn't matter who wins.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.817
-Really?
-[all] Really?

21:15.525 --> 21:17.818
Can we play another game?

21:18.153 --> 21:19.445
Just for fun?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.698
How about if we all play a game together

21:21.823 --> 21:23.575
on the ride back to school?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.535
Just for fun!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.288
[all laugh]
Yeah!

21:31.500 --> 21:33.210
[all]
Sun up.

21:34.712 --> 21:35.712
Drac!

21:37.088 --> 21:38.340
Katya.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.300
Lobo!

21:42.760 --> 21:43.970
Frankie!

21:45.680 --> 21:46.932
Zoe.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.102
Cleo!

21:50.602 --> 21:53.897
[roars]
Spike!

21:53.980 --> 21:56.065
[all]
Super Monsters!

21:56.148 --> 21:58.068
[bus]
Grrr bus.

21:58.152 --> 21:59.652
[horn honks]

21:59.737 --> 22:01.947
[all]
Bye, Mr. Capmore!

22:02.030 --> 22:03.782
[all]
