See, that does it.
Case closed. Driver, take us
to Bellevue and step on it.

What about you?
You walk through cabs.
You appear out of nowhere.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.313
That's because
I'm from the future.
And I'm crazy.

You're serious
about this angel thing, aren't you?

13:42.154 --> 13:44.679
Yes. I told you
when I said my name.

13:44.757 --> 13:50.161
Angela is Angel in Spanish.
[ Scoffs ]

13:50.229 --> 13:53.528
I was born Angelita,
which means " little angel.''

13:53.599 --> 13:57.433
But as you can see, I grew up.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.439

plenty of sweets in heaven.

- There's a dress code.

Would you excuse us
a minute, please?

Okay. I'll go chit-chat
with the cabbies.

I-I don't know.
I don't know.

14:26.232 --> 14:29.463
All I can tell you is
I ran over her with my car,
and she's alive.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.969
Give me a shot at her
and see how she comes out.

14:32.037 --> 14:36.872
Well, whatever she is, Al,
she needs help.

You're here for Max.
Tomorrow night,

14:41.714 --> 14:44.308
Max gets shot in a robbery
and left comatose...

14:44.383 --> 14:48.046
for the rest of his life.
All for lousy cab fares?

14:48.120 --> 14:51.715
Yeah, yeah, his life
riding on 50 bucks.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.452
That's all he needed was 50 bucks
to get his own medallion.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.553
What medallion?
His med-
Like that right there. See that?

14:58.631 --> 15:02.567
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>Well, every cab in New York</i>
<i>has one of those bolted to the hood.</i>

15:02.635 --> 15:05.263
And they're limited in number,
so they cost big bucks.

15:05.337 --> 15:08.670
[ Beeping ]
Back in '58,
they were going for 20 thou a pop.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.142
[ Whistles ]
Yeah. And FrankJr.,
who's the owner of the company,

15:12.211 --> 15:15.476
he set up a contest
and promised to give away
a medallion...

15:15.547 --> 15:19.677
to the first cabbie that earned
$1 5,000 for the company in the year.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.744
So that's a good price?
Yeah, but it's almost impossible...

15:22.821 --> 15:26.052
because they gotta split the fares
50-50 with the company.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.059
So that means they gotta
make $30,000?

15:28.127 --> 15:30.061
1 5,000 for themselves
and 1 5,000 for the company?
That's right.

15:30.129 --> 15:35.260
That was a lot of money back in '58,
but he did it doing double shifts,
weekends, holidays.

15:35.334 --> 15:39.430
He worked hard.
I, uh- I grossed
$50 today.

15:39.505 --> 15:44.204
Okay, well, that means
your total is up to $1 4,97 6.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.210
So you only need-
Twenty-five more dollars.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.371
I got it.
No, 50.
You have to split.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.381
50-50, 50-50
with the company.
Yeah, yeah, all right.

15:50.449 --> 15:54.146
So I need 50 more.
So you need 50 bucks to make the mark
of 1 5,000 by tomorrow night.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.389
But if I drive tomorrow night,
I'm gonna get shot.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.654
I can't drive tomorrow night.
Yeah, but it-

how'd you wind up an angel?

as a Puerto Rican Fanny Brice.

You think I care anymore?
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>

40:22.319 --> 40:24.787
Pop?
Go away, Max!

40:24.855 --> 40:27.255
He's holding a gun on Frank, Sam.
<i>I'm comin'in.</i>

40:28.793 --> 40:31.091
<i>[ Lenny ]</i>
<i>You listen to me, boy.!</i>

40:31.162 --> 40:33.926
<i>So you can get yourselfkilled?</i>

40:33.998 --> 40:36.523
Get your dad outta here, Max.
He's acting crazy.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.830
What's goin' on, Pop?

40:38.903 --> 40:41.463
I'm just getting what's owed you.

40:41.539 --> 40:44.133
- Take it easy, Sam.
- For that you're willing
to give up your life?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.142
Ah, it's over anyway.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.702
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.578
Rose, my job.

40:52.650 --> 40:56.313
I got nothing left.
You got me, Pop.

40:56.387 --> 40:59.447
You're who I'm doin' this for.
Now get outta here.

40:59.523 --> 41:01.457
Listen to your father,
and go away!

41:01.525 --> 41:04.153
You hear me?

41:04.228 --> 41:06.526
I need you, Pop.
For what?

41:06.597 --> 41:09.293
To be my partner.

41:09.366 --> 41:12.392
No one's gonna hire me now.
Not after this.

41:12.470 --> 41:17.305
I will.
But you lost the money.

41:17.374 --> 41:22.710
I know how to get the medallion.
But you gotta trust me.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.714
You gotta give me the gun.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.419
Give me the gun, Pop.

41:37.461 --> 41:39.759
Sam, look out!

41:39.830 --> 41:42.094
Sam!

41:42.166 --> 41:44.100
[ Gunshot ]

41:46.637 --> 41:51.370
- Set it down!
- Uh, s-slowly.

41:58.182 --> 42:01.982
<i>And I guess they got mad</i>
<i>'cause I didn't give them the medallion.</i>

42:02.052 --> 42:04.282
It's not my fault he got robbed.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.789
Sam, this guy is a liar.
This man, he's a liar.

42:06.857 --> 42:09.758
I mean, uh,
how do I know he didn't
take the money himself?

42:09.827 --> 42:12.660
Because you took it.
[ Scoffs ]

42:12.730 --> 42:15.631
I was here workin'
the whole time.

42:15.699 --> 42:19.465
I know.
So you sent somebody else.

42:20.638 --> 42:23.607
Didn't he?
What?

42:23.674 --> 42:25.869
You said this whole thing
was your fault.

42:27.278 --> 42:31.305
You robbed me,
and you thought that you shot her.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.510
That's why you went all white
when you saw that she was still alive.

42:34.585 --> 42:38.316
I am not a ghost.
I'm an angel.

42:38.389 --> 42:41.290
Well, whatever he did,
I know nothin' about.

42:41.358 --> 42:43.918
But he used your gun.

42:43.994 --> 42:46.292
A chrome .38
with a pearl handle.

42:46.363 --> 42:49.355
Same one that was used
in the robbery.

42:49.433 --> 42:51.628
Are you gonna listen
to this guy?

42:53.537 --> 42:56.802
Yeah. Why don't we go inside
and talk about it?

42:56.874 --> 42:58.808
No, I'm not takin'
the rap for you.
<i>Just keep your mouth shut.!</i>

42:58.876 --> 43:01.140
<i>No, no.</i>

43:03.414 --> 43:06.383
- <i>What happens to Lenny?</i>
- He gets probation.

43:06.450 --> 43:11.046
But only after Frank is charged
with being an accessory to the robbery.

43:11.121 --> 43:13.385
So, then Frank's gonna
go to prison, right?

43:13.457 --> 43:15.687
No.
N-No?

43:15.759 --> 43:18.990
No, he gets probation too.
But only after a plea bargain,

43:19.063 --> 43:22.226
and the judge forces him
to surrender the medallion to Max.

43:22.299 --> 43:26.235
And then Lenny and Max
form the Greenman Cab Company,

43:26.303 --> 43:28.703
but they can only
ever afford just one taxi.

43:28.772 --> 43:30.797
But that's all they
ever wanted, so yeah.
That's all right, yeah.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.274
That's all right.

43:33.344 --> 43:36.711
I'm sorry, Max.
It's okay.

43:36.780 --> 43:40.716
Besides, I got a feeling
everything's gonna
work out just fine.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.775
Yeah.

43:43.988 --> 43:46.752
You seen Angela?
I think she went down the alley.

43:46.824 --> 43:49.418
Oh. Yeah, thanks.
I'll be right back.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.334
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Angela.</i>

43:57.401 --> 44:00.666
What are you doin'?
Where you goin'?

44:00.738 --> 44:05.539
Well, it's my time to leave now.
What are you talkin' about?

44:05.609 --> 44:11.309
Oh, yeah. Oh, is this the part
where nobody's gonna
remember you were ever here?

44:11.382 --> 44:13.475
Uh-
[ Sniffles ]

44:13.550 --> 44:19.386
Well, not you, uh,
but people in- in this time.

44:19.456 --> 44:22.516
You're gonna forget about me,

44:22.593 --> 44:24.823
but I will always
remember you, Sam.

44:27.431 --> 44:30.195
Sam?

44:30.267 --> 44:32.997
Who do you think I was sent here
to really look after?

44:45.816 --> 44:48.011
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>You're not really gonna</i>
<i>let her go, are you?</i>

44:48.085 --> 44:50.713
Who?

44:50.788 --> 44:52.847
Who? Angelita!

44:53.957 --> 44:56.050
Huh?

44:57.361 --> 45:00.194
Do I know her?
Huh?

45:00.264 --> 45:02.198
Do you know-
Do you know her?

45:02.266 --> 45:04.200
Quit foolin' around, Sam.
What?

45:04.268 --> 45:08.227
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>You know what I'm talk</i>-
<i>I'm talkin'about Angelita, the angel.</i>

45:08.305 --> 45:12.139
The angel? Al, come on,
there's no such thing as angels.

45:23.921 --> 45:26.617
<i>[ Monitor Beeping ]</i>
<i>[ Woman ]</i>
<i>We're losing her, Doctor.</i>

45:26.690 --> 45:29.386
Do something!

45:29.460 --> 45:32.224
Doctor? Doctor,
are you all right?
Uh-

45:32.296 --> 45:37.324
- Yeah, I just need a second
to figure out what-
- She's in full arrest!

45:37.401 --> 45:39.665
Oh, no.

45:41.972 --> 45:44.236
She's gone.

45:44.308 --> 45:47.175
No, she can't be.
Oh, no.

45:49.279 --> 45:51.213
It's your fault.
What?

45:51.281 --> 45:55.217
She trusted you, and you killed her!
You bastard, you murdered my wife!

45:55.285 --> 45:58.152
Oh, boy.
