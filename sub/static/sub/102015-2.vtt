WEBVTT

00:12.179 --> 00:13.388
It is risen.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.351
My God. How much does that thing weigh?

00:17.434 --> 00:18.435
Twenty pounds.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.728
-That's huge.
-Thank you.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.730
Taste.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.817
No! No, don't.

00:26.235 --> 00:29.196
Emily, the judges will take off points
if it's partially eaten.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.491
Which is why I've made two.
Maggie's got the other one in the kitchen.

00:32.573 --> 00:35.077
Nearly threw me back out
lifting it onto the table.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.621
I am not taking any chances
with this baking contest.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.872
Last year was a disaster.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.040
You came in second.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.124
Yes, exactly.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.544
Nothing like that
can happen again, understand?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.796
I am winning this contest.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.715
Now, I need you all to taste it
and give me your honest opinions.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.594
It tastes like booze.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.429
Yes, I soaked it in brandy for a month.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.640
Getting, like, a nuance of dried fruit.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.600
It's the five pounds of raisins.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.477
It's a bit eggy.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.812
What do you mean?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.522
I mean there's a hint of egg.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.233
Is that a bad thing?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.944
No, no.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.572
-Dear, your cake is perfect.
-It's perfect.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.031
It's perfect.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.116
Oh, boy.

01:14.199 --> 01:19.705
I am gonna give this town a moist,
sticky, generously spiced ass-kicking.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.765
You're chewing so loud.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.018
Your mom's biscuits are the bomb.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.812
Why, thank you, Mr. Shipley.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.398
Your mom's such a role model.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.696
I must say, having you as our boarder
is even pleasanter than I ever expected.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.032
You fit right in with the family.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.577
Feels like a good fit to me too.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.121
At last, the big day is here!

02:01.205 --> 02:04.208
It's time for the Amherst Cattle Show!

02:06.877 --> 02:08.211
You're still eating breakfast?

02:08.294 --> 02:10.714
Come on, everybody's already
at the cattle hall.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.633
Let's moo-ve.

02:13.383 --> 02:14.384
Cow pun.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.096
-Austin, a word, please, in my office.
-Dad, it's Saturday.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.848
And we have business to attend to.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.186
Oh, Maggie.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.564
I just wanted you to know
you can take the night off.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.774
Oh, thank you, madam.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.901
So nice of you
to notice me back troubles.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.902
I didn't.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.029
Today is the Amherst Cattle Show,

02:34.112 --> 02:37.115
which means tonight is a special night
for me and Edward.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.742
I beg your pardon?

02:39.326 --> 02:44.498
You see, every year on the night
of the cattle show, Edward and I have...

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
a date.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.002
All right, then.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.421
The cattle show gets him very excited.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.257
I've heard enough, ma'am.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.800
Once a year.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.177
Like clockwork.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.679
Please, no more details.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.059
As my partner in this law firm

03:04.142 --> 03:06.728
and as a grown man
with your own home to manage,

03:06.812 --> 03:09.940
I assume you keep yourself
apprised of the family ledgers.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.609
-Of course.
-Well, so then, you must be aware

03:12.693 --> 03:15.737
that we have racked up
a substantial amount of debt.

03:15.821 --> 03:16.989
We have?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.282
We have.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.994
Yes, what with the railroad investments
and the stock market troubles,

03:22.077 --> 03:24.621
not to mention everything that we sank
into the building of your house.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.206
Which I'm going to pay you back for.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.958
Yes, I know, my dear boy.
That's your intention,

03:28.041 --> 03:31.503
but such a day seems to recede
ever further into the distance.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.630
And what with your wife's lavish tastes...

03:33.714 --> 03:35.090
Sue likes spending money.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.466
She certainly does.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.594
She never had the opportunity before.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.263
And it turns out she's good at being rich.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.724
Yes, well we're not quite
as rich as Sue thinks.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.394
We're not? I mean, we're not.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.478
No.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.315
But I have received news.

03:51.940 --> 03:52.941
Okay.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.863
Your uncle Mark Newman is dead.

04:00.949 --> 04:01.950
That sucks.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.703
-No. That's very good for us.
-Oh. Okay, good.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.789
Yes. You see, I have been appointed
executor of his estate.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.876
Yes, which means,
through various loopholes,

04:10.959 --> 04:13.378
-all strictly aboveboard, of course...
-Oh, yeah?

04:13.462 --> 04:17.507
Yes, that we may now have a new cash flow
to aid in reducing our debt.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.552
With one minor caveat, of course.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.721
Which may mean a little extra work for us.

04:22.804 --> 04:28.769
The adoption into our home
of one or two assets of the deceased.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.063
Okay, sweet. Sounds like
you got this all worked out, Dad.

04:31.146 --> 04:35.859
So, I won't rein in my spending
at the cattle show. Huh?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.277
Rein?

04:37.361 --> 04:39.154
-It's a horse pun, get it?
-No.

04:41.365 --> 04:46.537
By the way, Dad, it is a pleasure and
an honor to be your partner in the firm.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.663
Yeah--

04:47.746 --> 04:49.581
Stop poking me with a fork.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.583
Austin, where have you been?
I need you to taste my cake.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.168
Tell her it's good.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.546
Kind of intense talk with Dad.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.922
Is everything all right?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.799
I don't know, I was kind of zoning out.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.133
-You guys.
-What?

05:00.217 --> 05:01.927
Let's go hit the cattle show!

05:02.010 --> 05:03.387
Oh, yes!

05:39.965 --> 05:41.633
Works like a charm.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.229
Look, Edward, oysters.

05:54.771 --> 05:58.400
-I'm going to get some for tonight.
-Quite right.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.240
-So, you're, like, an actual sailor?
-Yeah.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.827
A Native American sailor.
That is so interesting.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.497
There are actually a lot of Native
American sailors in this time period.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.707
Cool.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.792
Hey, man.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.754
Don't steal my girl.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.380
-You stole my land.
-Ship.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.382
Sorry.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.467
Don't be old-fashioned.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.261
I am not gonna be fenced in
like a common pig.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.138
No offense.

06:28.222 --> 06:30.390
What's wrong with being old-fashioned?

06:30.974 --> 06:32.893
Why are we letting
traditional values out the window?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.062
There are differences
between men and women.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.314
You know, biologically, it's a fact.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.691
We have different skill sets.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.236
And it's beautiful.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.239
What does that have to do with anything?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.495
Excuse me.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.247
Pound cake coming through.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.543
Oh, my God.
It's time for the baking contest.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.729
Did I mention
I soaked it in brandy for a month?

07:17.813 --> 07:19.231
She's so extra.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.567
Jane, you didn't enter this year?

07:22.150 --> 07:25.237
No. I'm slightly busy being a widow.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.868
Lavinia, you're looking well.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.536
Oh, my God. The judges are here.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.623
I haven't seen you since you gave me
that tour of your vegetable garden.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.917
And you gave me syphilis.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.505
Tell us about that cider cake.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.966
But wait, where are the raisins?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.969
I've never seen a cider cake
without raisins.

07:49.052 --> 07:52.598
I couldn't find any raisins.
Everywhere was sold out.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.227
We are in for some surprises.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.938
My cake is made with six kinds of flour.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.232
-It looks like a biscuit.
-You look like a biscuit.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.401
Evelina Dickinson.

08:04.902 --> 08:06.153
-Emily.
-Of course.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.655
And what cake have you for us today?

08:08.739 --> 08:11.533
It's my take
on a traditional Caribbean black cake.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.286
It has two pounds of sugar
and two of butter.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.997
But I swapped in beef suet
for a richer flavor.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.334
Two whole nutmegs, 19 eggs,
and five pounds of raisins,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.753
a pound and a half of currants,
citron for flavor...

08:23.462 --> 08:25.005
All soaked for a month.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.090
Recipe called for two weeks,
but I doubled down.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.592
Her brain is broken.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.636
Do you have any questions?

08:30.719 --> 08:31.929
None spring to mind.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.972
Let's just have a taste.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.703
Are you nobody too?

08:59.790 --> 09:01.542
Am I who?

09:06.338 --> 09:08.131
I've never tasted anything like it.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.354
This one's gorgeous.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.440
Wouldn't she look perfect in our stables?

09:26.775 --> 09:30.863
Oh, look. She has a little baby.
You're pretty too.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.073
That is so sweet.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.285
Let's buy them.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.249
Hey, Sue.

09:43.709 --> 09:44.918
Can I ask you something?

09:45.002 --> 09:48.755
Is it whether I want this horse?
The answer is yes.

09:49.590 --> 09:55.846
No, it's something I've been
meaning to bring up for a while now.

09:59.433 --> 10:03.020
I made you a promise,
and I want to honor that promise.

10:03.562 --> 10:07.399
But every day gets harder for me.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.569
Austin, what do you mean?

10:10.986 --> 10:12.112
I was wondering...

10:13.447 --> 10:15.949
if you'd ever be willing to try?

10:17.576 --> 10:18.744
For a baby.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.623
You swore you didn't marry me
for that reason.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.291
And I didn't.

10:24.374 --> 10:30.380
But, Sue, I feel like
something is missing from my life.

10:33.217 --> 10:37.346
Wouldn't it be nice
to have something to take care of?

10:39.389 --> 10:41.016
Why don't you take care of me?

10:42.059 --> 10:43.393
And buy me a new horse.

10:54.821 --> 11:00.869
And the winner of this year's Amherst
Cattle Show baking competition is...

11:01.286 --> 11:02.871
Miss Emily Dickinson!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.293
Amherst baking contest so white.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.838
Yes, bitch!

11:11.421 --> 11:13.966
That's what you get for soaking this shit
in brandy for a month.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.051
-The judge was her aunt.
-The whole thing was rigged.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.302
Go, Emily!

11:18.095 --> 11:19.429
Why didn't you bake anything?

11:19.513 --> 11:22.808
I'd like to thank my maid, Maggie,
for her support in the kitchen.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.351
-I really couldn't have done it--
-No speeches, please.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.602
But I wrote a thing.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.688
The winner of this year's contest

11:27.771 --> 11:32.317
will have her name and recipe printed
in tomorrow's Springfield Republican.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.403
And, speaking of that fine paper,

11:34.486 --> 11:38.156
I believe that its illustrious editor
has just joined us.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.326
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Samuel Bowles!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.714
Hey, Amherst. Happy to be here.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.383
Mr. Bowles, come taste
the prizewinning cake.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.094
So, you're the winner?

12:01.263 --> 12:02.848
Come, Bowles. A taste.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.016
I'm good.

12:04.099 --> 12:06.143
Is he for reals gonna
get into that cake like that?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.227
Okay.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.280
Damn. It's good.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.160
Great.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.541
Yeah, Emily!

12:32.544 --> 12:35.589
Well, of course, I taught Emily
the fundamentals of baking,

12:35.672 --> 12:36.965
but the artistry was all hers.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.050
More tea?

12:39.384 --> 12:40.594
It's almost time.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.639
Edward. The guests!

12:44.306 --> 12:45.682
Patience.

12:47.351 --> 12:50.479
Emily, your cake was so good.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.563
Thank you, Jane.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.483
-It was the best cake I've ever tasted.
-I'm obsessed.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.943
Thank you, thank you.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.446
Didn't you say last year's cake
was the best you ever tasted?

12:59.530 --> 13:01.240
Last year's cake was hot garbage.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.158
For real. That cake was bullshit.

13:03.242 --> 13:06.995
People went so crazy over that cake,
but at the end of the day, it wasn't good.

13:07.079 --> 13:10.040
Yeah, whoever made that cake
should kill herself.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.416
She did.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.460
Wait, what?

13:13.544 --> 13:15.420
Last year's winner, that girl Lizzie?

13:15.504 --> 13:18.131
She fully had a mental breakdown
and committed suicide.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.925
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.718
-I heard about that.
-That's awful.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.387
I guess the fame just went to her head.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.266
Anyway, Emily, my cousin owns a mill.
I'd love to put you in touch.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.811
Maybe in your article you could mention
how you use his brand of flour.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.730
Is this the whisk you used for the cake?
Can I sell it?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.566
Will you be competing at Provincetown?

13:35.649 --> 13:36.817
No, this was really just--

13:36.900 --> 13:38.652
Of course she will.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.697
We'll be doing
the entire cattle show circuit.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.825
Boston, Providence, New Haven.

13:44.908 --> 13:47.703
-We will?
-Well, one win is nice. Two is momentum.

13:48.287 --> 13:49.913
Straighten your ribbon, dear.

13:51.707 --> 13:53.125
Cake, cake, cake.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.918
Cake, cake, cake, cake...

13:55.002 --> 13:56.670
Congratulations.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.005
Thank you.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.883
-Your name in the paper and everything.
-Yeah.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.636
I just think it's a little absurd,
don't you?

14:05.721 --> 14:06.889
Absurd?

14:06.972 --> 14:10.225
That you'll be remembered
as a baker, not a poet.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.270
Cake!

14:21.737 --> 14:22.738
What are you doing here?

14:22.821 --> 14:25.324
Hey, look, it's Amherst's celebrity baker.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.867
Please don't.

14:26.950 --> 14:27.951
I just wanna say,

14:28.035 --> 14:31.663
-I've been thinking and I don't want--
-Actually, I came to see your father.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.081
My father? For what?

14:33.165 --> 14:35.000
I'm looking for investors
for my newspaper.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.627
There he is, the man himself.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.753
My apologies, my good man.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.214
Sam Bowles. Editor in chief
of The Springfield Republican.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.507
Honor to meet you, Congressman.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.050
No. I gave up on politics.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.676
Well, I've got a new proposition for you.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.345
I was hoping we might sit down
and discuss?

14:46.428 --> 14:49.473
Another time, another time.
Go inside. Have some cake.

14:52.684 --> 14:57.064
Well, as long as I'm here,
wanna get this interview thing over with?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.442
-What interview thing?
-For the paper.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.403
It runs next to your recipe,
just a fun little intro.

15:03.487 --> 15:05.697
"Ten things you didn't know
about Emily Dickinson."

15:05.781 --> 15:08.116
Something to create a little buzz.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.038
Come on, let's walk off that cake.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.432
So, we just need a couple of fun facts.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.394
Fun facts, okay.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.815
Robins are related
to blackbirds and nightingales.

15:40.399 --> 15:42.526
Not about birds, about you.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.487
I don't wanna talk about me.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.198
All right, all right. Well...

15:49.116 --> 15:50.409
let's talk about me then.

15:51.410 --> 15:52.661
What do you wanna know?

15:54.788 --> 15:57.374
What's it like running a newspaper?

15:58.625 --> 16:01.044
It's exciting. It's nonstop.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.672
I'm always in the middle of things.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.674
I work all day, sometimes all night.

16:06.258 --> 16:09.303
Running around, chasing the stories.
Chasing the facts.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.682
When I go anywhere, talk to anyone,
I always ask them, "What's new?"

16:14.766 --> 16:16.435
That's how I found out about you.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.645
What do you mean?

16:18.729 --> 16:20.647
Well, when I got the letter from Suzie.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.566
She invited me to her party.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.526
And I said,
"Tell me who's gonna be there.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.944
Who do I need to know?"

16:26.445 --> 16:29.573
She said, "Well, there's this poet."

16:31.074 --> 16:36.371
So, you came to Amherst for me?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.374
Among other reasons, yeah.

16:40.584 --> 16:41.752
I was interested.

16:42.503 --> 16:44.713
I'm always interested
in hearing a new voice.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.341
But I haven't heard yours yet.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.261
No, you haven't.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.765
I've tasted your cake,
but I haven't read your poems.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.101
Guess I'm kind of shy.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.104
Yeah.

17:02.606 --> 17:03.815
You remind me of Mary.

17:04.775 --> 17:05.817
Mary who?

17:07.152 --> 17:09.655
Mary Bowles. My wife.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.115
Of course.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.535
She's just like you.

17:15.493 --> 17:16.494
Intelligent.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.079
Insightful.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.375
I mean, she really sees things, you know?

17:22.960 --> 17:27.297
But it's hard for her sometimes,
because she sees the darker sides of life.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.592
I get that.

17:30.676 --> 17:31.677
Yeah.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.054
It's not easy.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.432
I mean, she is an amazing woman,
but she just...

17:38.725 --> 17:39.935
She overthinks.

17:40.561 --> 17:41.770
You know what I mean?

17:42.855 --> 17:44.106
I think so.

17:47.359 --> 17:48.569
It's funny.

17:49.278 --> 17:52.948
I don't even know you,
but I feel like I do.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.369
Maybe I don't though.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.540
People are deceptive, aren't they?

18:06.211 --> 18:10.549
Anyway, if you're as special as Suzie says
you are, then I'm determined to find out.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.679
What if I don't want to be found out?

18:17.973 --> 18:19.975
What if I don't want fame?

18:20.601 --> 18:22.519
I love this modesty act.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.314
It's so perfectly ladylike.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.150
I mean, go ahead.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.611
Pretend to be this shy little daisy.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.991
But I'll come along,
and I'll pluck you from obscurity.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.785
Just like this.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.959
And besides, that whole attitude?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.587
It's so 1840s.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.797
It's 1859, baby.

18:52.549 --> 18:55.052
It's almost the '60s.

18:58.889 --> 19:01.016
You're an exciting person, you know that?

19:08.690 --> 19:09.691
Darlings.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.737
Bubbly is in the back.
And use the Baccarat crystal.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.741
It just arrived from France,
and the craftsmanship is divine.

19:18.742 --> 19:22.871
Anyway, I don't care about farming,
but clearly we need another horse.

19:23.497 --> 19:26.166
Technology is at such a pace these days.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.002
Oh, I know. Have you heard of Morse code?

19:29.086 --> 19:31.421
Heard of it? I'm fluent in it.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.131
I was sorry to hear about your husband.

19:33.715 --> 19:34.842
Honestly, it's fine.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.177
I'm really just in love with my baby.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.429
That's so nice.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.476
Sorry to interrupt.
The new horse is in the barn.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.186
Okay. Thanks, Henry.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.438
You got her another horse?

19:48.522 --> 19:50.107
Whatever Sue wants.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.611
-Free the wrist.
-Absolutely.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.947
The pagoda sleeve is giving me life.

19:59.783 --> 20:00.993
Wait, Henry.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.705
I want you to have this.

20:06.498 --> 20:07.499
What is this for?

20:08.166 --> 20:10.627
For whatever you need.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.005
Are you sure about this?

20:13.088 --> 20:14.756
Please. Take it.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.552
I want to pay for something
that actually means something.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.013
I truly appreciate this.

20:24.474 --> 20:25.642
What was that about?

20:25.726 --> 20:27.352
Oh, nothing.

20:27.436 --> 20:29.813
Just keep it between us, okay?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.065
You can trust me, Austin.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.987
Can I grab you some wine?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.322
Do widows drink?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.240
A lot.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.410
I better get back home.

20:44.328 --> 20:46.580
-We never did do that interview.
-No.

20:48.207 --> 20:49.458
No, and that's okay.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.752
I don't want to be remembered

20:51.835 --> 20:54.296
as the winner of the
Amherst Cattle Show baking contest.

20:57.341 --> 20:59.176
How do you want to be remembered?

21:07.226 --> 21:08.685
Fame is a fickle food

21:10.604 --> 21:11.605
That's good.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.066
Did you just think of that?

21:16.443 --> 21:17.444
Yeah.

21:18.362 --> 21:20.447
Yeah, there's a poem coming into my head.

21:21.949 --> 21:22.950
Right now?

21:24.409 --> 21:26.411
Yeah, they're always coming.
They never stop.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.206
Say it for me.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.585
Fame is a fickle food

21:36.171 --> 21:38.006
Upon a shifting plate

21:42.177 --> 21:43.804
Whose table once a
Guest but not

21:43.887 --> 21:45.514
The second time is set

21:52.354 --> 21:53.355
Keep going.

21:58.986 --> 22:02.573
Whose crumbs...
Whose crumbs...

22:02.656 --> 22:04.283
Whose crumbs the crows inspect

22:06.243 --> 22:09.580
And with ironic caw
Flap past it

22:11.874 --> 22:13.709
Flap past it to the Farmer's Corn -

22:14.710 --> 22:16.211
Men eat of it and die.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.884
Eat of it and die.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.102
That was better than your cake.

22:39.943 --> 22:40.944
This way.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.531
I'm in the parlor.

22:46.658 --> 22:47.701
-What's all this?
-What...

22:49.995 --> 22:51.121
is that?

22:52.122 --> 22:53.707
This is Anna and Clara.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.084
Mark Newman's girls.

22:56.752 --> 23:03.550
Their father has recently passed, so
they and their inheritance are now ours.

23:04.218 --> 23:06.553
Girls, greet your aunt.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.224
Where's our bed? It better be comfortable.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.100
Or I'm gonna set it on fire.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.451
You're in trouble.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.954
What are you doing here? Who are you?

23:32.037 --> 23:33.205
I'm Nobody.

23:33.747 --> 23:35.082
I'm here to give you a warning.

23:37.543 --> 23:39.628
Listen to me, Emily Dickinson.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.672
-So, you know who I am?
-I do. But I shouldn't.

23:42.798 --> 23:44.716
You shouldn't be known,
do you understand me?

23:45.133 --> 23:47.010
No. No, not at all.

23:47.094 --> 23:50.138
Emily, do not seek fame.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.060
Do not trust others
who would seek it for you.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.104
They are not genuine.

23:57.938 --> 23:59.398
Fame is not genuine.

24:00.566 --> 24:01.817
It will use you.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.611
It will destroy you.
