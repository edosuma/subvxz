00:16.260 --> 00:19.700
You're the missing park ranger.
I saw you on the news.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.300
Hey, man, are... are you okay?

00:23.060 --> 00:24.340
You!

00:24.420 --> 00:27.540
- You did this to me!
- What? I didn't do anything!

00:27.620 --> 00:29.580
[Brooke and Alex struggling on speakers]

00:29.660 --> 00:31.580
What is taking them so long?

00:32.220 --> 00:35.340
I called them ten minutes ago.
They should be here any minute.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.140
And you're sure
that he won't remember anything?

00:37.860 --> 00:41.500
It's my own mix of Propranolol,
a beta-blocker,

00:41.580 --> 00:44.620
- targeting the brain's limbic system.
- What?

00:44.700 --> 00:47.020
We have to make sure he forgets
that he stumbled on the cave.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.620
He won't remember anything
from the past 72 hours.

00:52.980 --> 00:53.980
[sighs]

00:54.060 --> 00:56.020
- [Brooke] Alex!
- [both grunting]

01:00.140 --> 01:01.140
[Brooke gasps]

01:01.900 --> 01:04.580
Alex, be careful!
[screams] Stop! Stop!

01:04.660 --> 01:06.660
[police sirens blaring]

01:10.980 --> 01:12.980
[theme music playing]

01:39.540 --> 01:43.380
Okay. We've confirmed the man you met
was in fact the missing park ranger.

01:43.460 --> 01:44.540
What happened to him?

01:44.620 --> 01:47.220
We think he must have had a mild stroke
and got lost in the woods,

01:47.300 --> 01:48.980
suffering from dehydration and amnesia.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.820
Thank God Alex was there.

01:52.020 --> 01:53.140
Where'd you learn how to fight like that?

01:53.780 --> 01:56.940
- Yeah, Alex, remind me, who's your father?
- [chuckles]

01:57.020 --> 01:58.580
What were you two doing out there
in the first place?

01:58.660 --> 01:59.700
You know there's curfew.

02:00.780 --> 02:04.020
- [stammers] Um...
- I thought I saw a flickering light.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.180
I was curious.

02:05.260 --> 02:07.620
Why didn't you come to me
instead of wandering around in the dark?

02:07.700 --> 02:10.380
- I didn't want to bother you.
- You didn't want to bother me?

02:10.460 --> 02:12.340
You could have been killed by a lunatic.

02:12.420 --> 02:13.740
I'm sorry, Dad.

02:13.820 --> 02:17.860
Actually, it'd be better if next time
you all alert me instead. Here.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.420
This is my direct line.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.780
Don't hesitate to call. Anytime.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.500
Thank you, but I'm sure
that won't be necessary.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.620
At least this park ranger saga is over.
I'll walk you to your car.

02:30.380 --> 02:31.460
[door opens]

02:33.620 --> 02:35.980
- [door closes]
- Why didn't you mention Marcus?

02:37.060 --> 02:38.940
I didn't want to get him into trouble.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.060
- But I... I thought that...
- I don't know!

02:41.140 --> 02:43.700
Okay? I'm not sure anymore, Alex.

02:51.940 --> 02:53.940
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.980
[sighs] I heard about what happened.

02:58.340 --> 03:01.060
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, sure.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.900
Um... yeah. [chuckles]

03:14.340 --> 03:17.220
Hey, babe, you okay?

03:18.380 --> 03:21.500
I almost died when I heard the sirens
and realized you were gone.

03:21.580 --> 03:22.780
It was so scary.

03:22.860 --> 03:25.420
I never should've said
the things about your mom.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.300
No. No, it's okay.

03:27.380 --> 03:30.220
Why does everything
have to be so complicated?

03:30.980 --> 03:34.740
Well, not everything.
Just everything that has to do with you.

03:34.820 --> 03:35.940
[both chuckle]

03:36.020 --> 03:38.500
But, hey, that's why I love you.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.540
I've missed us.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.220
There you are!
You got me worried there for a sec.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.180
- I'm fine.
- What were you doing out there anyway?

03:59.860 --> 04:00.740
Nothing.

04:02.060 --> 04:05.700
Alex, I've known you for your entire life.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.820
You know that if there's any information
you're holding out from me,

04:08.900 --> 04:10.180
I will get it eventually.

04:10.860 --> 04:13.820
Brooke said she saw something suspicious
over there, so I just...

04:14.500 --> 04:17.339
decided to go with her
to make sure she'd be all right.

04:18.339 --> 04:19.980
Isn't that Daniel's job?

04:22.940 --> 04:24.460
Wait, are you and Brooke...

04:24.540 --> 04:26.980
No! No! Of course not.

04:27.060 --> 04:30.100
Good. 'Cause you had me
worried there for a second.

04:35.140 --> 04:36.580
A stroke?

04:37.980 --> 04:42.060
[sighs] All right.
We can finally close this case, then.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.060
- Hmm.
- Sir?

04:44.140 --> 04:46.300
Carter. Come on in.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.860
Hey, hey! Looking good, buddy.
What's the occasion?

04:50.580 --> 04:53.060
[Diggs] Well, Carter reapplied
for his old job.

04:53.140 --> 04:54.860
I thought he would never ask.

04:54.940 --> 04:58.020
After seeing all the paperwork
that's piled up since I've been gone,

04:58.100 --> 05:01.620
- hmm, maybe I shouldn't have.
- [all chuckle]

05:01.700 --> 05:03.140
Welcome back, pal.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.540
Good to have you back, Carter.

05:04.620 --> 05:05.900
Yeah.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.660
So, what's this harvest festival about?

05:09.740 --> 05:11.900
It's one of the best traditions
we have here.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.180
Every year on Halloween weekend,

05:13.260 --> 05:16.700
the Greenhouse hosts an open fair
for the entire community of Santa Ynez.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.380
We're all gonna work really hard, okay?

05:19.460 --> 05:21.860
But keep in mind that this is all going
for a good cause,

05:21.940 --> 05:23.460
and all the money that we collect

05:23.540 --> 05:26.940
will be used to fund STEM scholarships
for underrepresented students, all right?

05:27.020 --> 05:29.940
- Let's do it! Come on, Eagles!
- [all cheering]

05:41.820 --> 05:45.300
- [Louis] Welcome to the Harvest Fair.
- [Sophie] Yeah!

05:45.380 --> 05:46.900
[cheering]

05:50.300 --> 05:54.060
With the money you're gonna collect today,
20 kids are gonna get to spend the summer

05:54.140 --> 05:56.900
- at an amazing STEM summer camp program.
- Nice.

05:56.980 --> 06:00.100
And you're gonna do this
by selling 200 delicious gourmet cupcakes.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.300
Bake sale?
That's the best he could come up with?

06:02.380 --> 06:05.380
But, Mr. Osmond,
those scholarships are really expensive.

06:05.460 --> 06:08.140
You're gonna have to sell way more
than 200 cupcakes to fund them.

06:08.220 --> 06:11.660
- Maybe Louis baked them in gold.
- [all laughing]

06:12.540 --> 06:15.940
I did not. And, Max, you're right,
this camp costs a lot of money.

06:16.020 --> 06:17.820
But fortunately for us,

06:17.900 --> 06:20.020
we have an alumni
who recently sold his start-up to Apple,

06:20.100 --> 06:21.220
and has agreed to help us out.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.300
For every cupcake that you guys sell,
our anonymous friend's gonna donate...

06:26.740 --> 06:28.740
[students] Whoa!

06:28.820 --> 06:31.700
- [Louis] One thousand dollars!
- Not bad for a bake sale.

06:31.780 --> 06:34.500
Each time you sell a cupcake,
you ring the bell at your booth

06:34.580 --> 06:36.740
and more cash will be injected
into the sphere.

06:36.820 --> 06:38.260
Even if we only sell 'em for a dollar?

06:38.340 --> 06:41.180
Theoretically, yes.
But there's also a twist.

06:41.260 --> 06:42.740
Twist? No way.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.700
A good leader is also a creative marketer.

06:44.780 --> 06:47.780
You must be able to sell
your ideas to the public.

06:47.860 --> 06:51.060
So that's why there's also going to be
a competition between the two houses

06:51.140 --> 06:54.780
to see who can earn the most money
selling the same number of cupcakes.

06:54.860 --> 06:58.460
The winner will get to choose the theme
for the Greenhouse Halloween dance party.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.580
That's the prize?
Who cares about the theme?

07:00.660 --> 07:01.740
However, the losing team

07:01.820 --> 07:05.540
has the pleasure of cleaning up the mess
by itself after the party.

07:05.620 --> 07:08.300
Forget everything I just said.
We are not losing this.

07:08.380 --> 07:09.580
[Louis] Good luck.

07:09.660 --> 07:11.660
[students cheering]

07:16.860 --> 07:19.820
[sighs] So what made you
finally decide to come back?

07:19.900 --> 07:21.060
Other than to yell at me some more.

07:21.140 --> 07:25.220
[chuckles] Yeah, I'm sorry
I was such a jerk last time you visited.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.300
You were.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.900
Yeah, well, you know me, uh,
I'm a bit slow.

07:30.980 --> 07:34.020
It took me some time to get
what you and my kids were telling me.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.140
I'm glad. For you and for them.

07:36.220 --> 07:40.860
Yeah. When I realized that Ryan
wasn't coming back, I, uh...

07:42.180 --> 07:45.660
I thought she'd want me
to live a good life in a clean house...

07:46.420 --> 07:48.380
go back to the job I love.

07:50.460 --> 07:51.460
What's that?

07:54.580 --> 07:57.700
The night before the launch,
Ryan gave me this letter.

07:57.780 --> 07:59.220
You know, a...

08:00.500 --> 08:02.300
open-in-case-I-don't-come-back letter.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.740
I'm so sorry.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.260
- Can I ask what she wrote?
- [sighs]

08:08.820 --> 08:11.460
Truth is I never opened it.

08:12.060 --> 08:13.260
Why not?

08:14.740 --> 08:17.740
Well, at first, I just...
I couldn't bring myself to open it.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.980
[sighs] And now, I don't want to.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.140
Maybe one day I'll read it,
when the time's right.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.260
Yeah, well, the important thing
is that you've moved on.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.980
Yeah. I guess.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.059
- Great Scott! [chuckles]
- Excuse me?

08:44.140 --> 08:46.420
I just thought of a great theme
for our Halloween dance.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.420
We haven't even won yet, Max.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.940
[stammers] I know.
Just in case, I want to be prepared.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.500
It's Back to the Future!

08:55.540 --> 08:56.780
Back to the Future!

08:57.620 --> 09:00.140
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You've never seen it?

09:00.220 --> 09:01.500
I've never even heard of it.

09:01.580 --> 09:04.580
It's just, like,
the best time-travel movie ever made.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.220
I gotta tell Emma. She's gonna love this.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.140
I'm sure she would.

09:10.220 --> 09:13.060
You gotta admit,
this challenge is a bit pathetic.

09:13.140 --> 09:14.540
You know what's pathetic?

09:14.620 --> 09:17.220
Staying after the dance
to clean up everyone else's mess.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.500
Not gonna happen.

09:18.580 --> 09:21.220
So let's focus, come up with a strategy.

09:21.300 --> 09:22.940
- Strategy?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.460
What, are we invading Russia?

09:24.540 --> 09:26.260
I mean, all we gotta do
is sell a bunch of cupcakes.

09:26.340 --> 09:28.340
A third-grader could do this.

09:28.420 --> 09:30.860
- I mean, not as well as me.
- [Hayley laughs]

09:33.740 --> 09:35.180
You think she's still mad at me?

09:35.740 --> 09:37.620
- Who?
- Emma.

09:38.780 --> 09:40.180
She's not even here.

09:40.860 --> 09:45.180
I hate to break it to you, but the world
doesn't revolve around Maximilian Miller.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.300
She... she'll probably be here soon.

09:53.780 --> 09:57.780
Yay! The cupcakes are here!
Oh, they look so good! [chuckles]

09:57.860 --> 10:00.220
Hey. Uh, can I share an idea with you?

10:00.300 --> 10:04.220
Uh, yeah, sure. But... don't you wanna
share it with everyone else?

10:05.340 --> 10:07.380
What for? They'll just do
whatever we tell them to do.

10:08.620 --> 10:12.300
Yeah, well, I... I'd really like to know
what everyone else thinks first.

10:12.380 --> 10:16.180
Hey, listen up, guys!
We have to figure out a plan.

10:16.260 --> 10:20.220
We have 200 cupcakes that we need to sell,
so we need a plan.

10:20.300 --> 10:23.220
Let's get creative.
Daniel, you had something in mind?

10:23.780 --> 10:25.660
No, forget it.

10:27.020 --> 10:31.380
Okay. Uh... Parker, what about you?

10:31.460 --> 10:32.460
Any ideas?

10:32.540 --> 10:34.900
Well, I was thinking
maybe we could do, like a...

10:34.980 --> 10:37.060
You know, like,
a "buy one, get one free" kind of sale?

10:37.140 --> 10:38.580
My mom goes crazy for those deals.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.260
Yeah, all right. I like it.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.420
Bad idea. We'll waste
half of our product on freebies.

10:44.500 --> 10:48.940
[sighs] Well, uh,
let's put a pin in that idea for now.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.980
Any other ideas, maybe?

10:51.060 --> 10:52.580
[Tammy] What about a raffle?

10:52.660 --> 10:55.580
Every purchase gets you a lottery ticket
to win some great prize.

10:55.660 --> 10:58.460
Then all our money
goes to some great prize.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.660
Here's an idea.

11:00.740 --> 11:06.020
How about we give away a T-shirt
with every cupcake?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.860
- Where did you get those from?
- [Parker] Huh.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.380
They're from last year.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.260
Uh, they were sold for, like, $25 each.
No one even knows we still have them.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.500
Daniel, I... [sighs]
I think we should tell Louis.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.300
We're trying to win a challenge.

11:18.380 --> 11:22.100
We give away a free T-shirt
with every cupcake.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.380
There's no way the Ravens can top that.

11:24.460 --> 11:28.860
- That sounds like a bribe, my love.
- No, it's not a bribe, babe. It's an edge.

11:28.940 --> 11:32.380
Well, no offence,
but I think it's the wrong edge.

11:32.460 --> 11:36.700
And Alex is right. You should give
those shirts back to Louis.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.660
Any other thoughts?

11:38.740 --> 11:41.020
- Get your red and blue Raven cupcakes!
- Come on!

11:41.100 --> 11:43.380
- Help support our STEM scholarship fund!
- Wanna get a cupcake?

11:43.460 --> 11:46.260
- One cupcake could save the world!
- Cupcakes?

11:46.340 --> 11:50.340
- [scoffs] What's your problem, Woods?
- I don't know. It's idiotic.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.740
Hey. Uh, how much are these?

11:54.660 --> 11:57.380
- Well, the small ones go for...
- There's no price on these cupcakes.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.580
- [scoffs] Really?
- This is for charity.

12:00.660 --> 12:04.220
We are raising money for disadvantaged
kids to go to a summer science camp.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.300
So we trust you to pay
what you feel is fair.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.780
- All right.
- What are you doing?

12:09.540 --> 12:10.540
Taste it.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.380
Trust me. This is democratic socialism.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.340
Mmm. It's delicious.

12:16.060 --> 12:19.420
Did you know that one of our STEM
scholarship students from 10 years ago

12:19.500 --> 12:23.180
went to Caltech and was part of the group
that invented Siri for the iPhone?

12:23.260 --> 12:26.740
Well, I'm gonna give you
$10 for the cupcake

12:26.820 --> 12:28.780
and $10 for the scholarship.

12:28.860 --> 12:32.300
Thank you very much.
You are donating to a great cause.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.340
Thank you.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
- [bell ringing]
- [student] Whoo!

12:36.300 --> 12:38.860
[chuckles] Wow, appealing
to the customer's emotions.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.020
- Good job, Woods.
- Thank you.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.700
I just spied on the Eagles.
They're just sitting around, talking.

12:44.780 --> 12:46.700
They haven't even sold a single cupcake.

12:46.780 --> 12:49.420
- [all cheer]
- [Leo] Awesome!

12:50.180 --> 12:54.020
Captain, if we win, I thought
of a good concept for the Halloween dance.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.100
Back to the Future costume dance party.

12:57.180 --> 12:59.940
I know Emma would back me up on this,
but she's not here.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.020
Where is Emma?

13:01.100 --> 13:04.260
She stayed at the clubhouse.
She had a headache or something.

13:04.340 --> 13:05.740
I should go check on her.

13:05.820 --> 13:09.860
Hey, Max, maybe that's not a good idea.

13:09.940 --> 13:12.060
Maybe she just needs
to be alone right now.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.660
- [Hayley] Get your cupcakes!
- [Leo] You want a cupcake? Hey...

13:20.500 --> 13:21.900
[door opens]

13:24.900 --> 13:26.500
Why aren't you at the fair?

13:27.420 --> 13:28.500
I'm not in the mood.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.260
You're drawing more attention to yourself
by hiding out like this. Come on.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.140
Get back to the fair
and act like nothing happened.

13:34.220 --> 13:35.700
But something did happen.

13:35.780 --> 13:37.740
Don't test me, Emma.

13:37.820 --> 13:41.100
Pull yourself together
and go out there now.

13:42.260 --> 13:43.700
- [bell ringing]
- [student] Whoo!

13:43.780 --> 13:47.660
Look. They're already selling
while we're still babbling.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.500
Maybe we should just start selling
to catch up.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.860
What? Without a marketing plan?

13:50.940 --> 13:52.860
We can think of one later.
We gotta make bank!

13:52.940 --> 13:56.220
Eagles, no. We can't panic like this,
okay? There's still time.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.940
At least we won't starve.
We'll have 100 cupcakes to eat.

14:00.020 --> 14:01.060
Hello, carbs.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.980
I can see Coach Davies forcing us
to eat kale for the next month.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.260
[all chuckle]

14:05.340 --> 14:06.340
[sighs]

14:07.380 --> 14:09.380
Wait. Do you know what?

14:09.460 --> 14:14.100
We can sell the smaller cupcakes
for a hefty markup

14:14.180 --> 14:16.580
because we'll call them
"healthy cupcakes."

14:16.660 --> 14:18.500
What's healthy got to do with cupcakes?

14:18.580 --> 14:21.900
It's all about portion control. Right?

14:21.980 --> 14:24.660
We'll use the bigger cupcakes as bait.

14:25.220 --> 14:27.260
We'll sell the bigger ones for $5,

14:27.340 --> 14:29.980
and we'll sell the smaller ones
for $20 each.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.540
You really think people
would be stupid enough

14:32.620 --> 14:34.580
to pay more money for a smaller cupcake?

14:34.660 --> 14:39.300
Have you ever been to a health food store?
Their prices are crazy.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.700
Trust me. Let's even call them
"guilt-free cupcakes."

14:42.780 --> 14:46.740
It's a win-win, all right?
Come on, guys, let's do this.

14:48.060 --> 14:52.500
- Healthy cupcakes for sale!
- Healthy cupcakes, guys! 180 calories!

14:52.580 --> 14:54.700
[Sophie] Healthy cupcakes!
It goes to charity!

14:54.780 --> 14:56.620
Tasty and healthy.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.940
- [Brooke] Five bucks!
- [Tammy] You know you want them!

14:59.020 --> 15:00.700
- Healthy cupcakes!
- [Tammy] Healthy cupcakes.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.220
Donate to a good cause. It's for charity.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.300
Healthy cupcake!

15:04.380 --> 15:06.460
You're not gonna believe this.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.780
The Eagles are selling
the tiny cupcakes for 20 bucks.

15:09.860 --> 15:12.020
- [chuckles] That's ridiculous.
- [all chuckle]

15:12.100 --> 15:13.500
Hey, Emma.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.900
Sorry I'm late, Captain.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.940
- How's your headache?
- Gone.

15:17.020 --> 15:21.220
So you get your cupcake
and a free shirt. All right?

15:22.540 --> 15:25.780
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm just trying to help us win.

15:25.860 --> 15:29.140
By going behind Sophie's back
with your idea that she rejected?

15:29.220 --> 15:31.500
Why are you always criticizing me?

15:32.660 --> 15:34.180
[sighs] You see what you did?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.580
And I thought we were done fighting.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.460
I thought we were done lying.

15:44.940 --> 15:45.940
Delicious, huh?

15:46.580 --> 15:48.740
[Sophie] Guilt-free cupcakes over here.

15:48.820 --> 15:50.980
- [bell ringing]
- [Eagles cheering]

15:51.060 --> 15:53.980
Oh. I didn't realize I ran out of cash.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.580
- It's fine. Enjoy the fair.
- [woman chuckles]

15:58.980 --> 16:01.900
What? Who cares? We almost sold out.

16:05.460 --> 16:08.220
[Sophie] Okay, Parker,
what are the results?

16:09.300 --> 16:11.180
[Parker sighs]

16:17.180 --> 16:21.420
Both teams chose unconventional
and gutsy marketing strategies

16:21.500 --> 16:23.460
to sell their cupcakes for charity.

16:24.060 --> 16:28.020
- The total amount raised was $150,000!
- [students cheering]

16:29.020 --> 16:31.620
We're gonna be able to send 20 kids
to summer camp this year.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.940
[students cheering]

16:34.540 --> 16:36.300
And as to your own little challenge,

16:36.380 --> 16:40.540
the winning team outsold the losing team
by merely $34.

16:41.740 --> 16:44.620
The winners...
winner of the Harvest Fair challenge,

16:45.660 --> 16:46.540
the Eagles.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.340
[Eagles cheering]

16:51.060 --> 16:54.540
[chanting] Eagles! Eagles! Eagles! Eagles!

16:54.620 --> 16:56.020
Eagles! Eagles!

16:56.100 --> 16:59.620
- Unbelievable.
- Hey. We tried our best.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.340
I have one more exciting announcement.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.580
Our anonymous donor has a partner.

17:03.660 --> 17:08.020
And when I told her about our charity,
she agreed to match our $150,000

17:08.099 --> 17:09.980
with another $150,000,

17:10.060 --> 17:13.420
which means we can provide
40 STEM scholarships instead of 20.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.819
- [Sophie] Oh, my God!
- [all cheering]

17:16.780 --> 17:19.339
Wait for it. There's a twist.

17:19.420 --> 17:21.619
There is only one condition.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.900
[chuckles] Of course.

17:22.980 --> 17:26.099
Our anonymous donor's partner
is also one of the top clothing designers

17:26.180 --> 17:27.300
for the fashion industry.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.260
And she has challenged our students to put
on an impromptu fashion show, right now,

17:31.340 --> 17:33.300
featuring the Greenhouse clothing line.

17:33.380 --> 17:36.460
If you can pull this off,
she will match our donations.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.780
- [students cheering]
- [upbeat music playing]

17:38.860 --> 17:40.260
[Hayley] Go, Alex!

17:47.340 --> 17:48.900
- [laughs]
- [Hayley] That's my bro!

17:54.260 --> 17:56.020
[cheering continues]

17:56.100 --> 17:58.620
I'm sorry we lost. It's all my fault.

17:59.220 --> 18:02.420
Socialism doesn't work.
But it was fun while it lasted.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.260
[cheering continues]

18:14.740 --> 18:17.340
Hey, cheer up!
You're about to go on stage!

18:17.420 --> 18:20.860
I know. I'm just bummed 'cause I had
a great idea for the party theme.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.740
- What was it?
- It doesn't matter. We lost.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.620
No, really. I'm open to everyone's ideas.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.660
Well, have you ever seen
Back to the Future?

18:31.740 --> 18:33.460
[cheering continues]

18:44.220 --> 18:47.060
[cheering continues]

18:47.140 --> 18:49.100
She said yes! She liked my idea!

18:49.980 --> 18:53.220
That is the most fantastic thing
I've heard in my entire life.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.100
I know, right?

18:55.180 --> 18:56.700
I see. Sarcasm.

18:56.780 --> 19:00.100
Please give a hand
to the students of the Greenhouse!

19:00.180 --> 19:02.100
- Yeah!
- [all cheering]

19:10.900 --> 19:12.620
Emma, you look very nice.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.340
We're wearing the same outfit.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.500
[stutters] Yeah, but you wear it
better than I do.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.140
Will you be my date
to the Halloween party?

19:22.220 --> 19:24.900
[clapping echoes]

19:26.500 --> 19:29.900
- Emma, did you hear what I...
- I heard. I don't think so.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.900
[cheering continues]
