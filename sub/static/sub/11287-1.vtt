WEBVTT

00:05.666 --> 00:09.500
Woo, ooh, I hate coming
to the laundromat.

00:09.566 --> 00:11.966
Exactly which part
do you hate, Ivana?

00:12.033 --> 00:14.500
The fact that, uh, Ms. Synclaire
here does your laundry

00:14.566 --> 00:18.266
or that she gives you a choice
to dryer sheets?

00:18.333 --> 00:19.766
Okay, Max, what do you want?

00:19.833 --> 00:23.066
Ocean breeze or citrus grove?

00:23.133 --> 00:24.766
I want a full sheet
of ocean breeze

00:24.833 --> 00:26.400
half a sheet of citrus grove

00:26.466 --> 00:29.000
and a couple of corners
of mountain meadow.

00:29.066 --> 00:31.400
Alright now don't push it,
missy, I'm only helping you out

00:31.466 --> 00:34.733
because I love this
laundromat now.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.033
I mean, this place a magical
microcosm where people

00:38.100 --> 00:41.166
of all walks of life
gather together to clean

00:41.233 --> 00:43.066
that which is closest
to them.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.500

Ho, ooh, ooh, ho.
Hoo!

01:40.740 --> 01:43.440
What is this?

01:43.506 --> 01:45.040
Lumberjack.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.606
It's Kyle's.
Give it back.

01:49.606 --> 01:53.306
Kyle wears these?

01:53.373 --> 01:55.440
Yes, ever since
I bought them for him.

01:57.573 --> 02:00.206
You mean to tell me, uh,
you've only been seeing Kyle

02:00.273 --> 02:02.246
three weeks and already
you're given him drawers?

02:04.313 --> 02:05.880
Well, I need a little Tabasco

02:05.946 --> 02:09.979
with my jalapeno
if you know what I mean.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.980
Which way is the front?

02:13.846 --> 02:16.213
That depends on how
freaky I'm feeling.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.279
That's it, we have
the moral obligation

02:18.346 --> 02:19.413
to keep these from you.

02:19.479 --> 02:21.313
‐ Fine.
‐ Go on, Synclaire.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.880
Give it here, here.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.113
Woo! Woo!
Woo! Woo!

02:27.646 --> 02:29.080
For the love..

02:31.380 --> 02:34.846
I'm here, I'm here,
give me here, go, go.

02:44.613 --> 02:47.680
Uh‐huh.

02:47.746 --> 02:50.446
They're dry now.

02:50.513 --> 02:54.313
Max, what are your friends doing
playing with my drawers?

02:54.380 --> 02:56.113
Is that your way of saying
thank you for taking

02:56.180 --> 02:58.946
the funk out
of my clothes.

02:59.013 --> 03:03.686
'A' I do not funk,
and 'B' doing a man's laundry

03:03.753 --> 03:06.420
is just another way women try
to usurp control.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.120
Please, if I wanted to control
you, I'd simply withhold sex.

03:09.186 --> 03:11.320
Oh, you kids, kids, uh,
you know this is

03:11.386 --> 03:13.986
supposed to be
a magical microcosm.

03:14.053 --> 03:15.353
You think y'all
could just chill?

03:15.420 --> 03:17.686
Yeah, come on, shorty,
let's go.

03:17.753 --> 03:20.153
Naked man is starting to
fold up his paper.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.453
We'll talk about this later.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.353
Fine, I won't be listening.

03:27.986 --> 03:30.853
Oh, man,
your girl is in a mood.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.486
Yeah, well, your girl's in
a sun dress with biking shorts.

03:37.020 --> 03:39.020
Jealousy, thy name is Kyle.

03:41.286 --> 03:43.086
Oh, looky who.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.120
‐ Regine again.
‐ Yes.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.353
Ever since she moved out

03:48.420 --> 03:50.686
the girl has popped up
all over the place.

03:50.753 --> 03:52.420
You know, Khadijah, I think
she's been hanging around

03:52.486 --> 03:54.686
hoping you'll start
talking to her again.

03:54.753 --> 03:56.520
With the way she moved out
on us?

03:56.586 --> 03:57.786
Only way I'm speaking
to her

03:57.853 --> 03:59.786
as if she's on a ledge
and I'm yelling jump.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.026
‐ Oh, hi, Regine.
‐ Hey, ladies.

04:06.826 --> 04:09.026
Khadijah.

04:09.093 --> 04:11.760
So, what brings you
clear across town?

04:11.826 --> 04:13.760
Oh, I love this laundromat.

04:13.826 --> 04:16.093
And it's a snap
to get here by subway.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.625
Hop on the D‐train, change at
Atlantic Avenue, grab the three

04:19.692 --> 04:22.960
to Grand Army Plaza, fifteen
minute walking you are here.

04:25.026 --> 04:26.893
Well, so, isn't your apartment
all fixed up nice?

04:26.960 --> 04:29.093
Ah, girl, it's fabulous.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.060
I've turned it into
a little French hideaway.

04:32.126 --> 04:34.759
Apparently so hidden your ass
can't seem to find it.

04:38.326 --> 04:40.160
[speaking in foreign language]

04:46.493 --> 04:49.093
[door knocking]

04:49.160 --> 04:51.793
[dog barking sound]

04:51.860 --> 04:53.693
What do you want?

04:53.760 --> 04:56.793
(Laverne)
'Regine, it's mommy.'

05:05.900 --> 05:09.000
I'm sorry I'm late, but I had
to hurdle three rhinos.

05:10.466 --> 05:13.300
Happy house warming.

05:13.366 --> 05:15.500
I haven't seen one of these
since grannies funeral.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.866
Well, what do you think?

05:19.933 --> 05:22.733
My very own Pied‐à‐terre.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.066
Well, I don't know what the heck
that is, but this is a dump.

05:28.033 --> 05:31.900
What are you talking about? This
place is packed with amenities.

05:31.966 --> 05:35.700
Breakfast nooklet,
soft wood floors

05:37.600 --> 05:39.366
and a veranda de soleil.

05:40.966 --> 05:44.533
Regine, that's a fire escape.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.966
You know, for once,
could you maybe

05:47.033 --> 05:48.766
give me some encouragement?

05:48.833 --> 05:51.866
Okay, okay. I encourage
you to pick up that phone

05:52.866 --> 05:54.966
disinfect it,
call Khadijah

05:55.033 --> 05:56.133
and beg her to take you back.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.300
If you won't I will.

05:57.366 --> 06:00.200
God knows
I've done it before.

06:00.266 --> 06:02.673
I'm not moving back in
with Khadijah.

06:02.740 --> 06:06.906
Fine, then think of it as moving
back in with Synclaire.

06:06.973 --> 06:08.840
Mom, there is nothing
wrong with place

06:08.906 --> 06:12.606
that a mountain
of gifts won't fix.

06:12.673 --> 06:16.206
Hence my house warming
party next week.

06:16.273 --> 06:19.373
Wait, you know, I would love to
stay and help you fill out

06:19.440 --> 06:21.240
the place cards
but those kids

06:21.306 --> 06:23.640
are eyeing my eight‐track.
Hey!

06:25.006 --> 06:27.073
Here, take the dog.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.140
You know I'm proud
of you, baby.

06:31.206 --> 06:35.406
I've never seen anybody stand
by such a bad decision.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.806
Out of the way boozers,
I'm coming down.

06:55.173 --> 06:57.040
Okay, I'm breaking off.

06:57.106 --> 06:58.540
Synclaire, come back
here, girl.

06:58.606 --> 07:01.980
‐ Okay, okay.
‐ Hell, I was leaning on you.

07:07.046 --> 07:08.346
Well, I'm very proud
of you, Max.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.713
You looked pretty good out there
for a roller blading virgin.

07:10.780 --> 07:13.346
Yes, well, as we both know
I move pretty well.

07:13.413 --> 07:16.280
‐ Alright.
‐ Come on.

07:16.346 --> 07:18.480
Well, come on, have a seat. I'll
help you off with the skates.

07:18.546 --> 07:20.546
Why, I'm not taking 'em off.

07:20.613 --> 07:23.013
Oh, come on, Max, you know
you're tired. Sit down.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.113
I know when I'm tired.
Don't tell me when I'm tired.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.213
I'd know, no control freak.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.746
Huh, you know
what your problem is?

07:29.813 --> 07:31.280
You don't know how to
let a man be a man.

07:31.346 --> 07:33.780
You really think somebody
trying to attack your manhood?

07:33.846 --> 07:35.080
Yeah, but what else
I'm supposed to think

07:35.146 --> 07:36.880
when you're always saying
"Be a man about it, Kyle.

07:36.946 --> 07:40.580
Be a man about it?"

07:40.646 --> 07:43.480
Well, it's good to know
you're listening.

07:43.546 --> 07:46.180
Now...help me take these
skates off, I'm tired.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.046
Dang, y'all worked through this
much faster

07:50.113 --> 07:52.546
than you did at that
laundromat thing.

07:52.613 --> 07:55.946
As I like to call it
"The rumble where it tumbles."

07:58.313 --> 08:02.353
Well, if it isn't
Starlight Express.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.886
Obie, look,
we got an invitation.

08:04.953 --> 08:06.520
You are cordially
invited to attend

08:06.586 --> 08:10.086
the house warming extravaganza
of Ms. Regine Hunter.

08:10.153 --> 08:13.753
Oh, here's one addressed to the
love birds, Maxine and Kyle.

08:16.353 --> 08:17.686
Anything for me?

08:17.753 --> 08:20.286
Well, just this Sweepstakes
offer designed to look like

08:20.353 --> 08:22.586
a check from the IRS.
Who would've thought?

08:24.453 --> 08:26.753
Regine does not miss a beat.

08:26.820 --> 08:29.953
She invited everybody but me.

08:30.020 --> 08:32.120
Well, maybe it's just
a party for couples.

08:32.186 --> 08:33.953
You know people who have
somebody in their lives.

08:34.020 --> 08:35.320
Don't feel bad, Khadijah.

08:37.453 --> 08:39.220
Khadijah, you can come
as our guest.

08:39.285 --> 08:43.320
No, says here, "You're hostess
respectfully requests

08:43.385 --> 08:46.020
no camera's, no children,
no guest."

08:46.086 --> 08:49.720
Translation, no Kodaks,
no kids, no Khadijah.

08:53.020 --> 08:56.253
Well, if you don't go,
Maxine and Kyle won't go.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.686
Yo, ho, ho, ho, whoa..

08:58.753 --> 09:00.460
You cannot just dictate.

09:02.726 --> 09:05.893
Side bar.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.660
Look, if I don't want to go,
you shouldn't want to go.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.360
But I want to go.

09:14.426 --> 09:16.193
And I am going.

09:18.093 --> 09:19.426
Bye‐bye.

09:24.293 --> 09:26.326
Oh, Kyle, be a man about it.

09:28.793 --> 09:30.093
He just hates that.

09:32.860 --> 09:35.193
Well, Khadijah,
are you gonna be okay?

09:35.260 --> 09:38.860
Please, I'm fine. It's not like
I'm desperate for things

09:38.926 --> 09:40.693
to do on a Saturday night.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.626
Really, that's the first time
in a month.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.860
You know, Synclaire,
sometimes I really love

09:48.926 --> 09:51.326
your wide‐eyed innocence.

09:51.393 --> 09:53.726
Yet sometimes you just
wish I shut up.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.293
‐ That's right.
‐ Yeah.

10:15.166 --> 10:17.366
‐ Welcome.
‐ Hi, Regine.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.366
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

10:19.433 --> 10:21.533
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

10:21.600 --> 10:24.733
Not at all, we just followed
the camera crew from "Cops."

10:25.766 --> 10:27.633
Well, it, it must be
convenient having

10:27.700 --> 10:29.066
everything all in one room.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.933
Yeah, sort of like
you own little Alcatraz.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.333
Hey, wait a minute,
you brought no Max.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.833
She and her bad attitude
are at home.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.900
Along with an
uninvited, Khadijah.

10:41.966 --> 10:45.100
Did I forget
to put her on my list?

10:47.266 --> 10:49.533
Was she mad?

10:49.600 --> 10:52.266
Oh, no. No, no, no.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.966
Oh, she had big plans.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.400
Didn't know
what they were but..

10:55.466 --> 10:56.833
Synclaire.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.506
So, Regine, come on, how do you
really like it down here?

11:02.573 --> 11:05.806
Kyle, I love it. I can't get
enough of the East Village.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.940
And the people
around here, I feel like

11:08.006 --> 11:10.140
I have known them
for years.

11:10.206 --> 11:12.940
Party can begin everyone,
I'm here.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.740
That's Carl,
he lives upstairs.

11:18.806 --> 11:20.640
Carl, honey,
these are my friends.

11:20.706 --> 11:23.206
This is, Synclaire,
Overton and Kyle.

11:23.273 --> 11:25.040
Charmed.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.640
Regine and I met
at the trash chute.

11:27.706 --> 11:28.873
She wanted me

11:28.940 --> 11:31.173
but I decided that
we should just be friends.

11:33.106 --> 11:36.673
Thanks so much for inviting me
after that devastating blow.

11:41.840 --> 11:44.406
Doesn't that level of arrogance
just turn your stomach?

11:47.906 --> 11:50.840
Say, who's that cat?

11:50.906 --> 11:53.173
(Regine)
'That's the building
superintendent, Orville.'

11:53.240 --> 11:57.406
Hey, Orvy, this is a party,
my friend, have some punch.

11:57.473 --> 12:00.073
Alcohol, while
I'm using sandpaper?

12:00.140 --> 12:01.580
Why don't I just sit
in a tub of kerosene

12:01.646 --> 12:05.546
and shove a lighter
down my pants?

12:05.613 --> 12:09.413
Bit graphic,
but the man's got a point.

12:09.480 --> 12:11.646
We brought you a gift.

12:11.713 --> 12:12.880
Oh.

12:12.946 --> 12:14.480
It's a sandwich press, ow.

12:16.946 --> 12:18.646
We let Overton
pick it out.

12:18.713 --> 12:20.380
Did you keep the receipt?

12:24.046 --> 12:27.180
You know, not that I was
dying to go her party

12:27.246 --> 12:30.580
or I care what her little
apartment looks like.

12:30.646 --> 12:35.013
What is Regine trying
to prove by not inviting me?

12:35.080 --> 12:36.346
More butter.

12:38.513 --> 12:41.013
She moved out and still
a pain in the ass.

12:43.746 --> 12:48.013
Now you are going to
enjoy, yes.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.213
Umm‐ummm, I can't believe
Kyle defied me

12:52.280 --> 12:53.613
and went to that party.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.946
That is the last pair of thong
underwear I buy that man.

12:57.013 --> 12:58.213
You know you think
you know someone

12:58.280 --> 13:00.086
and then they change on you.

13:00.153 --> 13:04.053
I have known Regine
for 25 years.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.920
Come to think of it, she's been
pretty stuck up the whole time.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.653
But you know what?
If she wasn't so petty

13:11.720 --> 13:13.620
I would have chipped in
on that sandwich press.

13:15.886 --> 13:18.720
If we go there and just get
a little glimpse of the place

13:18.786 --> 13:20.586
we can come back here
and rag on it.

13:24.053 --> 13:27.286
No, I wouldn't have gone
even if she had invited me.

13:28.253 --> 13:29.686
That's right.

13:29.753 --> 13:32.286
But now that she hasn't
invited you

13:32.353 --> 13:34.253
you have to go.

13:37.186 --> 13:38.620
Um..

13:39.986 --> 13:42.220
Let's do this.

13:42.286 --> 13:44.420
We cannot go over there

13:44.486 --> 13:45.853
without a house warming gift.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.720
Come on, Max.
Not even I'm that mad at her.

13:52.786 --> 13:53.886
Go ahead and get that
dish rack too.

13:53.953 --> 13:55.020
Alright.

14:08.026 --> 14:09.860
[door knocking]

14:09.926 --> 14:12.426
Hey, Max.

14:12.493 --> 14:15.360
Um...so much for
neighborhood watch.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.693
Here you go.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.626
Now, if you'll excuse me

14:20.693 --> 14:23.260
there's a man over there
I need to ignore.

14:27.993 --> 14:30.626
Excuse me, are you going
to eat all that?

14:30.693 --> 14:33.860
Uh‐huh.

14:33.926 --> 14:35.793
My girl, carry on.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.226
I didn't expect you
to show up.

14:40.293 --> 14:43.026
Why? Because you
didn't invite me?

14:43.093 --> 14:45.493
I thought you'd think
I would expect you to crash

14:45.560 --> 14:47.226
and so wouldn't come
just to be rude

14:47.293 --> 14:49.226
there by giving me
what I want.

14:52.026 --> 14:54.260
I thought you'd
think that so I came.

14:56.326 --> 14:58.993
Hey, Khadijah,
I'm so glad you crashed.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.033
There's this woman Lakeisha
you gotta meet.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.100
Now you keep saying
we need someone

15:02.166 --> 15:03.433
to pay the other
part of that rent.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.800
She's looking for
a place to live, come on.

15:04.866 --> 15:08.233
Ah, excuse me, this is not
a roommate hunting party.

15:09.933 --> 15:12.333
That's okay.
I'm not a guest. Come on.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.800
I'm not speaking to you.

15:24.033 --> 15:25.766
And, I can't believe
you came to this party

15:25.833 --> 15:27.366
after I told you not to.

15:27.433 --> 15:29.700
You know, if you are not
speaking to me

15:29.766 --> 15:33.400
then why do I feel like
I'm in a wind tunnel?

15:33.466 --> 15:36.200
And you know the only reason
you came here tonight

15:36.266 --> 15:38.200
was to be with me.

15:39.766 --> 15:43.033
Kyle, you are the most arrogant,
pig‐headed, self‐centered man

15:43.100 --> 15:47.166
I have ever met.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.533
I'm sorry, but taking you
home with me

15:49.600 --> 15:51.933
is simply out of
the question.

16:01.106 --> 16:04.573
Damn! They didn't
break the mold.

16:04.640 --> 16:07.006
Look, Max, if this
is going to work

16:07.073 --> 16:09.340
we cannot make everything
a power struggle.

16:09.406 --> 16:10.806
Well, if you just
put me in charge‐‐

16:10.873 --> 16:12.906
That's what I'm talking about.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.640
Listen, if I come on
a little strong

16:14.706 --> 16:17.606
it's just my way of
getting your attention.

16:17.673 --> 16:20.406
Well, if I walk away,
that's my way of getting yours.

16:31.273 --> 16:32.540
Alright you got it.

16:34.673 --> 16:36.173
What are goin' to do with it?

16:38.340 --> 16:42.406
Well, first,
I'mma give you this.

16:42.473 --> 16:46.340
Jumbo shrimp?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.706
I've been saving them for you
and that wasn't easy.

16:48.773 --> 16:51.040
You know there's a woman here
with a voracious appetite.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.906
Kyle, this is
the sweetest thing

16:57.973 --> 17:01.013
that you have
ever done for me.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.113
No it's not, this is.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.313
Cocktail sauce.

17:09.813 --> 17:12.079
Let's go home.

17:12.146 --> 17:13.613
Your place or mine?

17:13.680 --> 17:14.980
‐ Both.
‐ Arr..

17:17.613 --> 17:19.146
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, running my own

17:19.213 --> 17:20.813
pet grooming business
is not easy.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.146
Especially since I hired
my cousin

17:22.213 --> 17:23.313
as an assistant.

17:23.380 --> 17:24.945
Man, she lets the dogs
out the back door

17:25.012 --> 17:27.546
and says "Run like the wind."

17:27.613 --> 17:30.846
Oh, I'd love to fire her,
but you know she fam.

17:30.913 --> 17:33.246
You and Khadijah have
so much in common.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.813
(Khadijah)
If it's the truth,
I say we make this happen.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.946
You want the room,
it's yours.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.580
Who wants some punch?

17:41.446 --> 17:43.246
Isn't life amazing?

17:43.313 --> 17:45.180
We came to celebrate
with our old roommate

17:45.246 --> 17:46.580
end up with a whole new one.

17:48.713 --> 17:51.013
Well, sooky‐sooky now.

17:53.646 --> 17:55.513
Well, the Browns Stone's
a lovely little place.

17:55.580 --> 17:57.613
‐ You'll enjoy it.
‐ It sounds perfect.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.620
Well, perfect if you
hate privacy.

18:00.686 --> 18:02.286
I mean, you're never alone.

18:02.353 --> 18:05.286
Somebody is always up
crying over their love life

18:05.353 --> 18:06.653
or burning up the kitchen

18:06.720 --> 18:09.820
or taping Richard Bay
over your Thorn Birds.

18:12.053 --> 18:14.020
Oh, and you can always
count on Khadijah here

18:14.086 --> 18:17.053
to stretch out your wigs
just playing around

18:17.120 --> 18:19.353
and to give you advice
that you didn't ask for

18:19.420 --> 18:22.086
which turns out
to be right, of course.

18:22.153 --> 18:25.953
And then you realize that
she only butted in because

18:26.020 --> 18:28.186
she knows you better
than anybody else.

18:29.686 --> 18:33.953
You know this because you've,
you've had time to think.

18:35.453 --> 18:37.786
'Cause you're all alone now.

18:46.653 --> 18:48.586
So best of luck.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.386
Regine.

18:54.453 --> 18:56.720
You know what?
I think I'm gonna pass.

18:56.786 --> 18:59.120
Hey, I spent my days chasing
Beagles and Schnauzers.

18:59.186 --> 19:00.526
I don't need this drama.

19:03.860 --> 19:05.860
Regine, get out
of my arm pit.

19:08.493 --> 19:11.926
Sorry, I'm, I'm crying
all over your shirt.

19:13.460 --> 19:15.360
Oh, but it's not silk,
it's okay.

19:18.426 --> 19:20.793
Same old, Regine.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.860
Yeah, well, thank God
you haven't changed.

19:24.493 --> 19:27.126
You're always there
for me, Khadijah.

19:27.193 --> 19:28.693
Just like Bob R.

19:32.293 --> 19:33.960
What?

19:34.026 --> 19:35.993
Oh, remember when
we were kids

19:36.060 --> 19:38.426
and I read the story
of Bob R., the elephant king

19:38.493 --> 19:39.760
and his queen, Celeste?

19:39.826 --> 19:42.460
Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:42.526 --> 19:45.660
You figured, if elephants could
be royalty, so could you.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.060
So you renamed yourself,
Regine, the queen of

19:48.126 --> 19:51.160
what a stupid macaroni
from school.

19:52.693 --> 19:56.193
Yup, and you were there when
everybody else made fun of me

19:56.260 --> 19:58.693
and they called me
spaghetti‐head.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.533
I was making
fun of you too.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.666
No, but you understood me.

20:05.733 --> 20:06.833
No, I didn't.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.066
Then you pretended
really well.

20:12.133 --> 20:13.866
Okay.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.433
Khadijah, you're my
oldest friend.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.833
You're my best friend.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.633
Let's keep it real,
I'm your only friend.

20:29.866 --> 20:33.233
Oh, this is truly wonderful

20:33.300 --> 20:35.266
two friends together again.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.133
Sharing the love.

20:42.566 --> 20:44.833
Who are you?

20:44.900 --> 20:46.766
Lakeisha's cousin, Pauly.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.700
Hush, hush, hush, hush.
Hush, hush, hush, hush.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.700
Alright now, step back.

20:50.766 --> 20:51.900
If there's anybody
who's gonna provide any

20:51.966 --> 20:54.100
comfort right now,
it's gonna be me, alright?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.473
Woo, woo, woo.
Woo, woo, woo.

21:02.373 --> 21:04.406
So, what do we do now?

21:04.473 --> 21:05.573
I don't know.

21:07.473 --> 21:09.506
Well, we could go home.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.773
What you think, Synclaire?

21:13.840 --> 21:17.173
Day after day
I prayed for this.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.973
Wishing and hoping,
praying all the prayers‐‐

21:20.040 --> 21:21.606
Synclaire, Synclaire.

21:21.673 --> 21:24.206
I can live with it.
You know..

21:24.273 --> 21:27.740
Regine, there you are.

21:27.806 --> 21:30.073
Look, I've changed
my mind, darling.

21:30.140 --> 21:33.006
I'll see you upstairs...in ten.

21:39.806 --> 21:41.773
<i>(female narrator)</i>
<i>Don't go away,</i>
<i>we'll be right back.</i>

21:45.306 --> 21:48.206
It's really a magical place,
isn't it?

21:48.273 --> 21:51.673
The gurgling of the washers,
the gentle purring of all those

21:51.740 --> 21:53.873
dryers lined up like
little soldiers.

21:53.940 --> 21:57.073
Sometimes staring into a dryer
just takes me away.

21:57.140 --> 22:00.680
Watching the clothing tumble
round and round and round.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.413
For fun I like to watch
one little thing.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.880
Like a red sock.

22:05.946 --> 22:07.780
Sometimes it mingles
with the other clothing.

22:07.846 --> 22:09.980
Other times it just
goes off by itself.

22:10.046 --> 22:11.613
Who knows where it goes?

22:13.746 --> 22:16.180
Oh, oh, fabric softener time.
Excuse me.

22:17.946 --> 22:20.380
This place is a magnet
for psychopaths.

22:22.813 --> 22:24.346
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
