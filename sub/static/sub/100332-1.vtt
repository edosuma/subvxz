17:07.193 --> 17:09.160
[Boots]
 Well, what are we waitin' for?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.067
I want you to meet
        someone is all.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.570

17:20.573 --> 17:23.340
He served two tours
   a couple years before me.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.077
He's a war hero?

17:26.079 --> 17:29.247
Just because ya fight in a war,
don't make you a hero, man.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.748
[Boots] Yeah, it does.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.218
Don't talk about shit you
don't know nothin' about, Boots.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.720
Hey, you fought
       for your country.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.822
You killed terrorists.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.657
I don't care,
      you're a hero to me.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.325
I laid on rooftops
       and shot at people

17:41.327 --> 17:42.794
who didn't even know
          I was there.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.096
That ain't being
      a fuckin' hero, man.

17:45.098 --> 17:48.666
[Packard] Hey, hey, hey, man,
        who's this guy?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.702

Boots,
  I want you to meet Packard.

Oh, man.
  Hey, I know it's not much--

18:05.452 --> 18:07.385
No, no, no. You keep that.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.654
You take care of yourself.
  Take care of that woman too.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.255
Of course, man.
      We're gonna do that.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.690
Yeah. All right, man.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.493
Hey, your brother, man.

[Kip] Come on, Boots.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.306
[Boots]
 Hey, what was that all about?

18:30.310 --> 18:32.143
You skimming off
     the top for that guy?

[sighs]

18:58.538 --> 19:00.838
I know you've been meeting up
          with people.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.342
Trying to make moves.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.583
Come on, man, it's nothing.
         It's-- It's...

19:13.353 --> 19:14.685
You need to kill it.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.922
No, man.
 I'm not gonna fucking kill it.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.691
Fuck! I'm trying to look out
      for you, all right?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.326
You don't need this shit.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.231
This shit is what we do, man.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.935
There ain't nothin' else for me.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.209
Just fucking kill it.
          You hear me?

19:40.647 --> 19:41.712

[Cooper]
   You think this is boring?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.635
You should come visit me
          in Tisdale.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.331
All right! Fine.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.300
He's, um... He's got a guy.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.570
He sells other shit, but no oxy.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.639
No pills. Not yet.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.541
His name's Marcus.

-[Cooper] The only thing, man...
             -What?

20:47.447 --> 20:51.816
It's gotta be quite a lot.
Make it worth it and everything.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.287
Okay. Yeah.

You and me?
     We're, um, still good?

22:55.908 --> 22:59.643
Still maintaining our
       delicate balance?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.115
Is that what this is?

23:06.018 --> 23:07.718
A delicate balance?

23:14.394 --> 23:16.660
So long as I don't see anything
       I don't wanna see.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.131
I know. Of course.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.501
You take care, Kyle.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.803
You made a choice, Jo.

  how quiet it gets out here.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.829
Yeah. It's too quiet.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.631
You can hear yourself think.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.802
When was the last time
    you slept a full night?

We're all in this together.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.598
[Boots] What are we doin' here?

33:31.744 --> 33:34.478
What's going on?
   What's my car doing here?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.146
Someone could've seen it, Boots.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.549
There's way too much
          on the line.

33:39.551 --> 33:43.420
-You gotta be smarter.
         -[Boots] Wait!

33:43.422 --> 33:47.124
Josie, what the fuck!
      Come on. Hey, look.

33:47.126 --> 33:49.243
I know I messed up.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.361
You wanted to be part of this?
    This ain't a kid's game.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.230
The world's a cold,
        ruthless bitch.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.765
I can't afford for you
    not to understand that.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.034
-Look, I didn't mean--
  -It's never just you, Boots.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.803
You doing this
      ain't gonna make me

33:59.805 --> 34:01.438
learn better or anything.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.441
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything.

34:06.412 --> 34:09.045
You're a big man now.
You can clean up your own shit.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.051
Show us you're ready for this.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.822
-No evidence gets left behind.
       -[lighter clicks]

34:28.500 --> 34:30.400
[Boots sniffs]
       Josie, I'm sorry.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.079
Josie, I'm sorry!

34:42.781 --> 34:44.214
[door slams]

34:47.152 --> 34:49.286
[car engine starts]

36:32.191 --> 36:33.623
[shop bell rings]

36:42.701 --> 36:44.568
-[Josie] Hey.
       -[Eve gasps] Hey!

36:45.904 --> 36:48.505
Kip, uh,
   asked me to swing this by.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.673
[Eve] More baby stuff?

36:50.742 --> 36:51.975
That was sweet of ya.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.343
[Josie] So, um...

36:54.646 --> 36:56.680
you and Kip been lookin'
       at houses at all?

36:58.584 --> 36:59.716
Yeah, a bit.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.319
I think we're gonna look at
      some more this week.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.887
All here in town, I hope.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.922
Oh, yeah, we ain't gonna go far.

37:05.924 --> 37:09.359
Good. Because I still need him.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.829
Yeah. Course.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.833
All right.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.803
See ya around.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.004
Yeah.

37:21.974 --> 37:23.473
[shop bell rings]

37:23.475 --> 37:24.674
[car door closes]

37:52.904 --> 37:55.739
[Boots sighs]
 So, what do you want me to do?

37:55.741 --> 37:56.773
[Kip] Nothin'.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.209
Not a goddamn thing.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.643
Then what's the point of me
       even bein' here--

38:00.646 --> 38:02.479
[Kip] If it were up to me,
     you wouldn't be here.

38:02.481 --> 38:03.580
Yeah, well...

38:06.585 --> 38:08.718
[Kip sniffs, sighs]

38:12.724 --> 38:13.823
[Kip] Here we go.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.925
[car engine starts]

38:37.716 --> 38:39.316
Stay here and watch.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.099
What the fuck is this?

38:58.704 --> 38:59.869
Who the fuck are you?

38:59.871 --> 39:01.938
Just give me the fucking money.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.913
Yeah,
  that's not gonna be enough.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.717
Fuck you, man. You're done.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.685
You son of a fucking bitch,
  I'm gonna get you for this.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.087
[Duane] Don't fucking
       walk away from me.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.455
[gun cocks]

39:26.031 --> 39:30.867
Really? Is this it?
   This is what you wanna do?

39:30.869 --> 39:32.869
-[car door opens]
     -Yo, what's going on?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.104
[Kip]
  Get back in the car, Boots!

39:34.106 --> 39:35.705
[Scrapper] What the fuck
      are you doing, man?

39:35.707 --> 39:36.907
Who the fuck are you?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.108
[Kip] Hey, calm down,
       that's my brother.

39:38.110 --> 39:39.809
He's gonna get you
  some more money, all right?

39:39.811 --> 39:40.977
-Just calm down.
       -[Scrapper] Yeah?

39:40.979 --> 39:42.412
-Well, come on then!
            -Boots,

39:42.414 --> 39:44.514
in the glove compartment,
       there's more cash.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.982
Just bring it to me, all right?

39:48.453 --> 39:49.686
[Scrapper] Well, come on then!

39:49.688 --> 39:50.954
[Kip] Fucking calm down.

39:56.428 --> 39:57.994
[Duane] The fuck is he doin'?

40:05.704 --> 40:07.070
Hey, hurry up!

40:18.650 --> 40:20.483
[Duane] Come on, let's go!

40:22.888 --> 40:24.504
[sighs]

40:24.505 --> 40:26.121
I'm just gonna go back
     and get it, all right?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.624
[Duane] Slow.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.595
[Kip]
  Get back in the fucking car.

40:33.498 --> 40:34.964
[Duane] Slowly.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.667
Grab the money.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.176
[Scrapper] Come on.
 Let's get the fuck outta here.

40:46.178 --> 40:48.478
Come on, man, let's go.

40:52.451 --> 40:53.516
Fuck!

41:00.492 --> 41:02.725
Fuck! Get in the fucking car!

41:10.469 --> 41:12.535
-[engine starts]
             -Fuck!

41:12.537 --> 41:13.636
[tires screech]

41:35.093 --> 41:37.560
[sirens blares]

41:41.600 --> 41:43.666
You're good.
         Just be smart.

41:46.204 --> 41:48.355
What the hell is going on?

41:48.356 --> 41:50.507
-[Kip] What do you think?
-[Sheriff Knox] Evening, y'all.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.678
Quite a scene you're causing,
             Kyle.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.147
Wanna come inside?

41:58.149 --> 42:00.550
[indistinct radio chatter]

42:00.552 --> 42:01.918
I'm fine out here.

42:04.523 --> 42:05.688
How ya doin', Boots?

42:07.092 --> 42:08.892
[Josie] You wanna tell us
        what's going on?

42:11.596 --> 42:13.563
I don't know if y'all heard,

42:13.564 --> 42:15.531
but a few kids went missing up
  in Tisdale a few days back.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.534
Local boys are on the case.

42:17.536 --> 42:20.303
They followed some tire tracks
        into the woods

42:20.305 --> 42:24.674
and found a piñata
       of shell casings.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.043
Multiple weapons.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.779
One of which was a .308.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.049
Y'all wouldn't know
    anyone else around here

42:33.051 --> 42:34.784
with that kind of hardware,
           would ya?

42:35.720 --> 42:37.320
Afraid we can't help you.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.790
None of us ever go up
          to Tisdale.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.125
Yeah, see, that's just it.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.264
This wasn't up in Tisdale.

42:48.266 --> 42:52.602
This was just past the river.
  Right here in Bates County.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.313
You listen to me closely.

43:03.315 --> 43:06.649
I can't stand by
   and just let this happen.

43:07.586 --> 43:09.118
Don't be stupid.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.287
We have leads.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.257
We have witnesses.

43:15.594 --> 43:17.760
And we're closing in
      on this thing fast.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.998
Good luck finding that rifle,
             Knox.

43:24.769 --> 43:26.235
Y'all have a good night.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.908
[takes deep breath]

43:31.910 --> 43:32.942
[car door closes]

43:33.778 --> 43:35.078
[car engine starts]

43:39.684 --> 43:41.284
[car pulls away]

43:43.121 --> 43:44.787
[breathes heavily]

43:50.695 --> 43:52.895
-How'd the buy go?
        -They fucked us.

43:52.897 --> 43:54.631
Assholes nearly shot us both.

43:54.633 --> 43:55.865
-[Kip] Josie!
          -They what?

43:55.867 --> 43:56.933
That's it.

43:57.369 --> 43:58.635
It's over.

43:58.637 --> 44:00.069
What are you talking about?

44:00.872 --> 44:03.039
I'm done.
          We're done.

44:03.041 --> 44:05.408
Excuse me?
  You don't get to say when--

44:05.410 --> 44:07.744
You said that when we needed to,
           we'd stop.

44:07.746 --> 44:09.145
This is that time.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.414
-That's--
  -No questions asked, right?

44:13.718 --> 44:15.018
Don't tear this apart, Kip.

44:15.020 --> 44:16.419
Wake up, Josie!

44:16.421 --> 44:18.221
We got cops
     knockin' on our doors,

44:18.223 --> 44:19.789
Boots just had a gun
          to his head.

44:19.790 --> 44:21.356
Hey, don't fucking talk
  about me like I ain't here!

44:21.359 --> 44:23.026
I can't go into a bar
    without somebody trying

44:23.028 --> 44:24.293
-to kick my head in!
       -That's bullshit!

44:24.295 --> 44:26.029
I will not put this family
      in any more danger.

44:26.031 --> 44:27.263
You wanna keep
     the Conleys together,

44:27.265 --> 44:28.765
then we stop this shit
           right now.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.433
Without the dope,
 there are no fucking Conleys!

44:30.435 --> 44:31.834
Don't you fucking get it?

44:33.138 --> 44:34.871
Or are you gonna put your girl
        through college

44:34.873 --> 44:36.272
by chopping fucking wood?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.742
This gave you everything.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.444
It's who we are.

44:41.446 --> 44:44.313
And I'm not gonna quit just
 'cause you're getting scared.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.983
I will fix it.

44:47.786 --> 44:50.253
Knox, Cooper, all of it.

44:50.255 --> 44:53.690
-I will fix it.
     -You're just like him.

44:54.726 --> 44:55.925
Just like him.

44:55.927 --> 45:00.063
[Josie] Kip, wait!
       Kip, I can fix it!

45:11.276 --> 45:13.076
[Boots] This is so fucked.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.814
This needs to be sorted
     and bagged right away.

45:20.351 --> 45:22.351
-Are you a part of this or not?
             -Yeah.

45:27.358 --> 45:28.925
-Where you goin'?
         -[door closes]

46:00.892 --> 46:02.125
[Kip] Hey, what's up, man?

46:02.127 --> 46:04.160
[Gonzo] Hey, man.
        [clears throat]

46:07.766 --> 46:11.234
You, uh, want me to go wipe down
       the booth for ya?

46:11.236 --> 46:13.269
[Kip] No. No.
     I'm not working, man.

46:13.271 --> 46:14.971
I'm just here
     for a little clarity.

46:14.973 --> 46:16.239
Clarity, huh?

46:16.241 --> 46:18.508
We like to keep most
         of our clarity

46:18.510 --> 46:20.009
in the bottom of the glass.

46:20.011 --> 46:21.310
[Kip] That's what I hear.

46:22.914 --> 46:24.380
Rocks or straight up?

46:24.382 --> 46:26.048
[Kip] Straight up.

46:29.788 --> 46:31.387
[Gonzo] You let me know
   if you need anything else.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.455
[Kip] All right.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.223
Thanks, brother.

46:37.362 --> 46:38.928
[Ted] You ain't welcome here.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.565
I got no business with you,
            brother.

46:43.902 --> 46:45.501
-[Gonzo] Hey, Ted--
        -[Ted] Shut up!

46:46.204 --> 46:47.537
[bangs chair]

46:49.841 --> 46:51.140
Come on, man.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.809
Fuckin' coward!

46:52.811 --> 46:54.377
Hey, you better calm down,
           all right?

46:54.379 --> 46:55.511
Calm down!

46:55.513 --> 46:57.513
[clattering]

46:57.515 --> 46:59.015
She was everything to me.

46:59.017 --> 47:01.017
-Look at me, you fuckin'--
       -[glass shatters]

47:01.019 --> 47:02.285
[Clay] Not in my bar!

47:02.287 --> 47:04.187
You know what this man did!

47:04.189 --> 47:07.023
[Clay] Not in my bar ever.

47:07.025 --> 47:10.827
We'll take care of your tab
      for tonight already.

47:10.829 --> 47:12.094
You go on home.

47:15.033 --> 47:17.433
I hope you get to feel
   just an ounce of the pain

47:17.435 --> 47:19.135
you've poured into this town.

47:20.905 --> 47:23.172
'Cuz it will fucking eat you up.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.356
[Clay] You're lucky I was here
       to save your ass.

47:43.328 --> 47:44.861
What do you want, old man?

47:44.863 --> 47:47.330
What do I want? Hmm.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.901
When I was a little kid,

47:51.903 --> 47:55.171
we were playin' behind
       my house one day.

47:55.173 --> 47:58.007
Little kid
     named Jimmie Mooney...

47:59.310 --> 48:01.510
he got bit by a snake.

48:02.447 --> 48:05.081
Right here on the vein.

48:06.651 --> 48:08.484
And we didn't tell my mom.

48:08.486 --> 48:12.455
We knew goddamn well
   that we'd get in trouble.

48:12.457 --> 48:17.526
Well, that venom traveled
real fast through Jimmie's body.

48:18.596 --> 48:20.596
And a few hours later...

48:22.100 --> 48:24.066
he died on my porch.

48:25.236 --> 48:26.969
Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

48:26.971 --> 48:28.304
[Clay] Yeah.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.607
Hear me.

48:35.346 --> 48:37.513
That venom is in you.

48:38.216 --> 48:39.949
It's in all o' you.

48:40.919 --> 48:42.451
And it's spreading.

48:42.453 --> 48:45.922
Deputies came in here
    asking about you.

48:45.924 --> 48:49.358
They're probably questioning
   that knocked up girlfriend

48:49.360 --> 48:50.960
of yours right now.

48:52.297 --> 48:54.931
And you got a decision to make.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.135
Are you willing to cut off
             an arm

48:59.137 --> 49:01.237
to save the body?

49:28.700 --> 49:30.366
[shop bell rings]

50:02.567 --> 50:04.033
[knocking on door]

50:05.503 --> 50:07.270
[Cooper] Josie.

50:07.271 --> 50:09.038
-[Josie] Hey, Coop.
   -What are you doing here?

50:09.774 --> 50:11.207
Can we talk?

50:12.610 --> 50:15.277
I'm... I'm really sorry.

50:16.414 --> 50:17.580
It's godawful.

50:19.384 --> 50:20.750
Losing a brother.

50:22.453 --> 50:24.020
And like that?

50:25.189 --> 50:28.391
Look, me and Boots,

50:28.393 --> 50:31.060
we never meant to cause you
   any kind of trouble, or--

50:31.062 --> 50:32.194
[Josie] I know.

50:32.797 --> 50:34.196
Your brother...

50:34.198 --> 50:38.067
Your brother was just in
  with some really bad people.

50:38.069 --> 50:40.202
And they caught wind of a deal.

50:47.645 --> 50:51.180
I... I really appreciate you
        coming out here.

50:52.316 --> 50:54.316
I was fucking terrified
          that you'd--

50:54.318 --> 50:57.486
We got you burned
  and that you'd never wanna--

50:57.488 --> 50:58.721
[Josie] Listen.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.757
They were shooting
       at my brother too.

51:02.527 --> 51:03.592
Remember?

51:03.594 --> 51:06.529
It's a miracle
    you two got outta there.

51:14.539 --> 51:17.306
I don't advocate for this much.

51:18.242 --> 51:19.308
But...

51:22.346 --> 51:25.314
you and I are both going through
      some shit right now.

51:26.717 --> 51:28.084
[sighs]

51:28.086 --> 51:30.286
If ever two people
         deserved to...

51:31.322 --> 51:33.155
unplug for a second, it's...

51:34.258 --> 51:35.658
you and me right now.

51:38.229 --> 51:39.328
You with me?

51:49.107 --> 51:50.372
You done that before?

51:50.374 --> 51:53.809
No, I saw my brother do it
          a few times.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.548
[Josie] Feel so good
          in a minute.

52:07.792 --> 52:09.425
[sighs]

52:11.596 --> 52:12.728
[Cooper] Fuck.

52:12.730 --> 52:14.697
[chuckles]
             Yeah.

52:14.699 --> 52:16.165
[sighs]

52:18.736 --> 52:20.736
I'm glad you got outta there,
              man.

52:20.738 --> 52:22.505
[Cooper exhales]

52:24.809 --> 52:26.442
You're a good kid.

52:28.279 --> 52:30.679
You don't deserve to go down
    in your brother's mess.

52:33.918 --> 52:36.352
Have the cops been calling
      around here at all?

52:38.756 --> 52:39.855
Huh?

52:40.391 --> 52:41.557
The cops?

52:41.559 --> 52:44.827
They're gonna try
   to hang this on somebody.

52:44.829 --> 52:47.363
[sniffs]
           Maybe you.

52:48.666 --> 52:49.899
Maybe Boots.

52:51.269 --> 52:52.434
Maybe even me.

52:52.436 --> 52:53.602
[lighter clicks]

52:53.604 --> 52:56.172
Gotta make sure
      we don't get burnt.

53:25.469 --> 53:27.503
[Josie] <i> They ask you</i>
   <i> any questions or anything?</i>

53:27.505 --> 53:28.671
[Cooper] <i> Hmm. Sure.</i>

53:28.673 --> 53:32.208
When Mom first caught wind
    that they were missin'.

53:33.377 --> 53:35.511
[sighs]
     But I-- I was a mess.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.947
I couldn't--
    I couldn't say a thing.

53:38.950 --> 53:40.316
[Cooper sighs]

53:40.885 --> 53:41.951
But the...

53:44.322 --> 53:48.257
The Bates County guy,
     he called yesterday...

53:49.527 --> 53:50.693
wanted to...

53:51.762 --> 53:53.963
ask some questions
      of his own, I guess.

53:54.999 --> 53:56.265
Yeah?

53:56.968 --> 53:58.801
[exhales]
           Is that...

53:59.904 --> 54:01.670
Is that-- Is that okay?

54:01.672 --> 54:03.706
-Should I be worried?
              -No.

54:06.010 --> 54:07.876
Nothing for you to worry about.

54:07.878 --> 54:09.912
-Just, here.
     -[Cooper] Wait, wait.

54:09.914 --> 54:11.780
-That's for you to--
      -[Josie] Hold still.

54:36.641 --> 54:39.508

54:41.946 --> 54:44.446

57:03.654 --> 57:05.053
[Josie sniffs]

57:16.934 --> 57:19.201
[Jack] ...and I sat there,
         stared at it,

57:19.203 --> 57:22.471
but I know I couldn't do it,
            ya know?

57:22.473 --> 57:24.206
I just thought about my kids...

57:25.676 --> 57:26.942
and so I'm here today.

57:26.944 --> 57:29.445
[moderator] Thank you
       for sharing, Jack.

57:29.447 --> 57:30.646
[all] Thank you, Jack.

57:30.648 --> 57:32.648
Anybody else like to share?

57:34.618 --> 57:36.051
[Sheriff Knox]
       I'd like to share.

57:36.053 --> 57:39.655
[moderator] Okay, great, Kyle.
           Go ahead.

57:40.791 --> 57:42.591
[Sheriff Knox]
  I'm Kyle, I'm an alcoholic.

57:42.593 --> 57:44.159
[all] Hey, Kyle.

57:44.161 --> 57:46.995
[Sheriff Knox]
  I had a bad day yesterday...

57:49.500 --> 57:52.034
and I was tempted, um...

57:53.604 --> 57:54.837
I was alone.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.941
My wife went to her mother's.

57:58.943 --> 58:01.009
There was an argument
          about work.

58:03.581 --> 58:06.515
Things there have been
      kinda rough lately.

58:09.153 --> 58:12.254
Ya know, people you trust
  can let you down sometimes.

58:16.894 --> 58:17.960
Anyway...

58:17.962 --> 58:20.596
when she left, there it was.

58:20.598 --> 58:24.032
Sittin' there, waiting for me--

58:25.803 --> 58:26.869
[door closes]

58:26.871 --> 58:28.937
[moderator]
      Sorry. Go on, Kyle.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.143
[Sheriff Knox] Hey.

58:52.096 --> 58:54.530
You know, it helps
  if you stay the whole time.

59:04.575 --> 59:05.908
You all right?

59:08.712 --> 59:10.212
Sorry about Breanne.

59:11.949 --> 59:13.015
That cunt.

59:13.551 --> 59:14.816
[laughs]

59:18.656 --> 59:20.055
Here we are again.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.958
Two fuckups
    in the same parking lot.

59:25.229 --> 59:26.929
You think
  we're going to be doing this

59:26.931 --> 59:28.697
in 30 years too, hmm?

59:30.601 --> 59:33.802
Like two broken pieces
         of pottery...

59:33.804 --> 59:35.487
[sighs]

59:35.488 --> 59:37.171
...sitting in some shitty,
          old cabinet.

59:39.176 --> 59:41.209
No idea
   what you're talking about.

59:44.048 --> 59:45.681
Why do we do it, Jo?

59:48.752 --> 59:49.952
I'm sorry.

59:51.021 --> 59:52.087
Why?

59:54.825 --> 59:56.658
I really, really am.

59:58.963 --> 01:00:00.362
[sobs]

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.875
Wait, wait.

01:00:13.877 --> 01:00:16.979
[both panting]

01:00:18.182 --> 01:00:19.247
I can't.

           -Fuck off.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.337
Fuck!

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:56.311
Kip, honey,
     you need to calm down.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.081
Let's go back inside.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:02.451
Come back in and talk
  to your brother, all right?

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:08.356
Kip.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.926
Kip.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.394
Kip, wait!

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:16.064
I don't know
   what you got in your head,

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.934
but don't you go doin' nothin'
   you can't come back from,

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.068

What exactly do you think
         you're doing?

01:03:25.002 --> 01:03:27.002
I asked you
    a fuckin' question, boy.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:29.004
[sighs]
      This one's for you.

01:03:35.813 --> 01:03:37.512
What the fuck you want, Conley?

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.049
Repentance.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.421
[Eve] You, uh...

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.424
You want a pop or something?

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.360
I got some extra here.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:03:59.367
Here ya go.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.273
Thanks.

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:07.108
Let me clean you up a bit.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.611
Help us take our mind
          off things.

01:04:09.613 --> 01:04:11.046
What do you say?

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.150

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:42.704
Look at that.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.641
We got quite the man
         on our hands.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.244

01:05:52.482 --> 01:05:53.949
You were right, ya know.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:56.351
Your father'd be proud of you.

[sighs]

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:14.569
What happened to you?

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:17.038
[exhales]
         I'm all right.

01:11:20.644 --> 01:11:22.010
I suppose you heard.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:28.416
I don't have a whole lot
of information just yet, but...

01:11:29.419 --> 01:11:30.485
Sorry--

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:31.719
I don't need you
       to talk, Sheriff.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.355
[Sheriff Knox] Understood.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.624
Just listen.

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:39.394
Excuse me?

01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:42.497
[Kip] No doubt
    you'll search her truck.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.867
When you do,
  you're gonna find that .308

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.368
you've been looking for.

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.638
And I'm guessing
  that the casings gonna match

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.007
the bullets found
   in them poor Tisdale boys.

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.445
She was a determined woman,
            Sheriff.

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.687
I'm gonna have to bury
           my sister.

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.055
And when I do, I...

01:12:09.626 --> 01:12:12.760
I'd like to bury this whole
Conley business along with her.

01:12:15.332 --> 01:12:17.632
I don't think it's going to be
       that simple, Kip.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.569
Yeah.

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:23.671
It is.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.875
Last thing we want
  is your wife and kid knowing

01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:29.944
that you liked to fuck
     the local oxy dealer.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.581
Right?

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:40.788
You're a good man, Kyle.
     You always have been.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:44.559
But that don't mean you don't do
     bad things sometimes.

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:48.096
I just don't see a reason
   to hang you for it is all.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.099
Do you?

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:58.840
All right.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:02.677
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:13:02.679 --> 01:13:04.379
I'm gonna
   go see my little brother.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.504
[indistinct chatter]

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:04.839
-Take her for a minute?
          -[Kip] Sure.

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:17.985
Oh, so cute.

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:19.954
-[chuckles]
    -She don't sleep.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:23.825
[Gonzo] She did good today, man.
           Real good.

01:14:23.827 --> 01:14:25.026
Didn't cry or nothing.

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:26.994
She's a tough cookie.

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:28.963
She takes after her mother
           that way.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.164
[Gonzo] Oh, yeah.

01:14:31.468 --> 01:14:32.533
[baby coos]

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:35.736
So, uh, how you guys gettin' by?

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.739
I mean, she's cute as hell,
             but...

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.209
it ain't cheap having a kid.

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:45.079
You, uh,
   really put all that away?

01:14:46.716 --> 01:14:47.782
Got to.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.217
Mm.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:51.486
We get by.

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:54.822
Eve says that the salon's
        doin' real good.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.624
And the little bit extra
         from the mill.

01:14:57.694 --> 01:14:59.060
Just day by day, brother.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:00.695
Yeah.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.732
[bottles clink]

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.276
[Boots] You're fuckin' late.

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:16.944
Yeah, I-- I'm sorry. I just...

01:15:19.883 --> 01:15:20.948
Here.

01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:23.117
So that'll hold you, yeah?

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.853
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:28.656
And?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.994
Well, uh, yeah, yeah,
         Kip doesn't--

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:35.763
Yeah, well, Kip ain't here.
             Is he?

01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:49.577
The world's a cold,
        ruthless bitch.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:52.647
You gotta know your place in it.

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:55.683
Yours is there.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:15:59.720
Mine's here.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.091
Now, get the fuck outta here.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.894
And if Kip sees you,
      you're fuckin dead.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.796
-All right?
          -All right.

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:17.672
[music playing]

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:23.878
[Eve] Hi.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:29.016
Hey. You look nice.

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.690
[Eve] Thank you.

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:37.792
Uncle Boots.

01:16:37.794 --> 01:16:39.093
[chuckles]

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:42.797
Just takin' care of business.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.715
[Kip] Hey, man.

01:17:05.254 --> 01:17:06.754
You leavin' already?

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:10.791
Yeah. Uh...

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.829
I got some things to do.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:29.644
[car engine starts]

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.065

¶<i> Come now, sweet baby</i>
     <i> Don't remember me</i> ¶

01:20:57.553 --> 01:21:03.057
¶<i> Remember I</i>
     <i> Taught you the art</i> ¶

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:08.963
¶<i> So no, I don't need anything</i> ¶

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:14.068

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:53.908
¶<i> Is it the end?</i> ¶

01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:59.046

¶<i> In fact why don't you take</i>
        <i> A sip for me</i> ¶
