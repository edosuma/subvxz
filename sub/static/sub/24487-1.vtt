WEBVTT

00:10.744 --> 00:13.079
So Socrates says to the guy,

00:13.113 --> 00:14.614
"is something right,
because god says so?

00:14.647 --> 00:16.181
Or does he say so

00:16.216 --> 00:19.185
'cause it's the right thing to say?"

00:19.219 --> 00:20.520
Come again?

00:20.553 --> 00:22.322
But you know what,
if you think about it,

00:22.355 --> 00:24.090
if something's right,

00:24.124 --> 00:25.592
or if god says something's right,

00:25.625 --> 00:27.560
because that's the
only right thing there is,

00:27.594 --> 00:29.162
that concept,

00:29.195 --> 00:30.530
that shit's greater than god.

00:30.563 --> 00:32.698
And you're telling me this, why?

00:32.732 --> 00:34.667
Well, it's called an education.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.503
Haven't you heard, berg,
knowledge is the key.

00:36.536 --> 00:40.206
Key to what?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.709
I don't know,
happiness or some shit.

00:42.742 --> 00:45.412
Isn't that what
little jimmy Holloway said?

00:45.445 --> 00:47.781
Who?
Little jimmy Holloway.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.250
He did a bid for frank sand,
up state

00:50.283 --> 00:51.451
a couple years back.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.153
Right.
Short guy?

00:53.186 --> 00:56.256
Nah. He literally had
a little jimmy.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.490
Mm-hmm.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.459
Unfortunate nickname
if you ask me.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.628
I think his given name
was Charles,

01:01.661 --> 01:03.129
something like that.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.465
Anyway, when he came
out of prison,

01:05.498 --> 01:06.900
they found him in the river,

01:06.933 --> 01:08.535
face down

01:08.568 --> 01:09.702
with his little prick

01:09.736 --> 01:12.138
stuffed halfway
down this throat.

01:12.172 --> 01:16.709
Why? Because he knew
too much...

01:16.743 --> 01:18.311
knowledge.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.712
That's what knowledge got him.

01:19.746 --> 01:23.283
I don't want knowledge.
I want ignorance, okay?

01:23.316 --> 01:25.385
Give me ignorance anytime.

01:28.855 --> 01:29.856
Hey.

01:31.558 --> 01:33.359
What's happening?

01:33.393 --> 01:36.196
What the fuck is this?
What's this philosophy shit?

01:38.565 --> 01:41.634
Karen's taking it this semester.

01:42.802 --> 01:44.671
Hey, man.

01:44.704 --> 01:48.308
You know, that fiancÃ©e of yours?

01:48.341 --> 01:49.576
What about her?

01:49.609 --> 01:53.346
She... she... you know.

01:54.714 --> 01:55.849
I hope she's worth every penny,

01:55.882 --> 01:57.217
I really do.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.451
You know,
just because you decide

01:58.485 --> 02:00.286
to treat everybody in the world

02:00.320 --> 02:01.621
like they're out to fuck you,

02:01.654 --> 02:03.223
that doesn't mean you're right.

02:03.256 --> 02:07.393
No, it does.
That's exactly what I mean.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.595
Hey.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.400
You sure these guys are coming?

02:14.434 --> 02:16.769
Oh, ye of little faith.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.638
My ci's solid, trust me.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.773
Christopher.
Yes, sir?

02:20.807 --> 02:22.909
You're short again. I don't
see how that's possible...

02:22.942 --> 02:25.311
Look, how many times do we have
to have this conversation?

02:25.345 --> 02:26.713
I don't give a fuck
about your excuses,

02:26.746 --> 02:28.548
just get it right.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.217
Yes, sir.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.719
Where do you think you're going?

02:32.752 --> 02:34.554
I thought that I would just
clean up the glasses.

02:34.587 --> 02:37.557
Who told you to think?

02:37.590 --> 02:40.660
Hey, buddy, hey!

02:40.693 --> 02:43.530
You gotta order a drink
or get out.

02:43.563 --> 02:46.966
Hey. This ain't a hotel, man.
Rise and shine.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.270
Oh, god.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.504
Don't stand there like an idiot.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.606
Clean that shit up.

02:53.640 --> 02:57.377
And the phone's
not gonna answer itself, huh?

03:00.647 --> 03:02.382
You know, sometimes,
Christopher.

03:02.415 --> 03:05.685
I wonder what the fuck
I'm paying you for.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.327
Reno tavern, how may I help you?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.029
Where the hell are you?

03:16.062 --> 03:18.665
Vic, calm down.
Look, I'm almost done.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.867
It's gonna be plenty of time
for me to pick up Sam at 3:30.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.902
Do you know what day it is?

03:22.936 --> 03:25.371
Shit.

03:25.405 --> 03:29.509
He gets out early on Fridays.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.412
I am so sorry, Vic.
Is he pissed?

03:32.445 --> 03:34.280
I'm fine, dad.

03:34.314 --> 03:37.050
I'm the one that has to go
and pick him up, drop him off,

03:37.083 --> 03:38.585
and then I have to go
back across town

03:38.618 --> 03:39.752
to get to my meeting

03:39.786 --> 03:40.920
which I am now gonna be
late for.

03:40.954 --> 03:42.455
I mean, fuck, Chris!

03:42.488 --> 03:44.357
Did you at least get
the money together?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.593
I'm gonna pick up a few extra
shifts next week, I promise.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.661
Christopher, you're almost
five months behind.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.764
I mean, you're his father
for Christ's sake.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.999
I mean, what am I
supposed to say?

03:53.032 --> 03:55.301
I can't be both his parents,

03:55.335 --> 03:57.637
there's supposed to be a father
and a mother working together.

03:57.670 --> 03:59.872
I can't do all by myself.
Christopher, why didn't you put

03:59.906 --> 04:01.808
the new signs out yet?
Okay, honey, yeah.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.943
Christopher, if you
hang up on me, -love you too.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.545
I swear...
Hello? Is anyone in there?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.847
Oh, sorry. What?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.082
I'm going home early today,

04:09.115 --> 04:11.351
please make sure
that you lock up today.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.386
And for god's sake,
don't forget to stock

04:13.419 --> 04:15.655
all the new inventory boxes.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.557
Last time I came in and...

04:17.589 --> 04:19.826
I almost tripped
and I broke my neck.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.861
Yeah, I hope you
break your fucking neck,

04:21.894 --> 04:23.730
you piece of shit.
What'd you say?

04:23.763 --> 04:25.732
Huh?
Nothing, I just, uh,

04:25.765 --> 04:28.468
I said, I need a dolly.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.437
Remember last time
I messed up my back, remember?

04:31.471 --> 04:34.107
Tough shit.
Oh, yeah?

04:34.140 --> 04:35.675
And if I'm not here Monday

04:35.708 --> 04:37.610
'cause my worker's comp
has kicked in,

04:37.644 --> 04:39.946
who's gonna lift
all those boxes? Him?

04:39.979 --> 04:41.714
You?

04:41.748 --> 04:43.349
Check next door.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.851
I think they borrowed it
this morning.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:57.030 --> 04:58.731
Eight of 'em.
I count eight.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.642
Berg, how much money

05:09.676 --> 05:11.811
do you think they have in there?

05:11.844 --> 05:14.647
I don't know.
Let's go find out shall we?

05:21.054 --> 05:24.090
Are you fucking serious, man?

05:24.123 --> 05:27.393
You guys look upset.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.629
Come on, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.631
When are you gonna make
$2 million in five minutes?

05:31.664 --> 05:32.932
You tell me to enjoy ourself,

05:32.965 --> 05:34.801
we came here to make
a damn drug deal.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.503
Straight up the business, huh?
Yeah, just like that.

05:37.537 --> 05:38.638
So, why don't you tell your boy

05:38.671 --> 05:40.807
to pop that dope out?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.408
Fuck it, you're right.
You're right.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.810
Guys, come on.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.712
Bring them
what they came here for.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.516
All right.

05:52.652 --> 05:54.954
Oh, no,
that's a beautiful thing.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.696
Show him the money, man.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.002
It's all there.
We got a deal?

06:10.036 --> 06:11.904
That's a done deal.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.006
LAPD, let me see some hands!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.943
Hands! Hands!

06:18.845 --> 06:20.613
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
We're the LAPD.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.482
You might have heard about us.

06:22.515 --> 06:24.450
We're just gonna take
a couple moments of your time

06:24.484 --> 06:25.885
and then we're gonna be
out of your hair.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.454
You might not wanna do that.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.190
All though they've made
advances in medical science,

06:31.224 --> 06:34.961
they haven't yet learned
how to reattach a head.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.463
Well, that's a good move.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.731
Teach your wife that one.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.199
Can we change the subject,
detective?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.802
Here we go, first thing's first,

06:42.835 --> 06:45.138
all you bad guys out there
with the weapons,

06:45.171 --> 06:47.073
let's see two fingers
on the weapons.

06:47.106 --> 06:50.476
Two fingers only, please.
Two fingers only.

06:50.510 --> 06:54.147
Raise 'em very slowly,
very nonviolently, very good.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.883
Now, put the weapons
on the table.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.552
Very slowly.

07:03.856 --> 07:06.793
Very nice.
You two in the back as well.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.996
Thank you.
Thank you, kindly.

07:10.029 --> 07:11.697
Good, good.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.968
Wow, look at this one.
Now, take two steps back.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.471
Two big steps back.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.975
It's like that, man.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.944
You two motherfuckers
just gonna walk in here

07:24.977 --> 07:27.213
without reading us our rights?

07:27.246 --> 07:30.650
Did we forget to do that?

07:30.683 --> 07:34.153
I guess so.
These are your rights.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.888
You have the right

07:35.922 --> 07:38.691
to keep
your motherfucking mouth shut.

07:38.724 --> 07:41.661
Or I'm gonna shoot
your fucking head off.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.864
Was that good? Yeah?

07:44.897 --> 07:48.501
All right.
Let's do this.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.240
What is this, a fucking joke?

07:54.273 --> 07:55.274
Huh?

07:55.308 --> 07:56.742
You're the fucking police,

07:56.776 --> 07:57.944
you can't just walk out of here

07:57.977 --> 08:00.980
with $4 million
of our drugs and money.

08:01.013 --> 08:02.982
Oh, wow.
You finished 8th grade.

08:03.015 --> 08:04.317
Good for you.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.019
Wonderful.
Come on, let's go.

08:07.053 --> 08:10.189
Do you have any fucking clue
who I am?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.825
I'm gonna enjoy
killing you slowly.

08:12.859 --> 08:16.796
Yeah, that's right. I'm even
gonna kill your family members.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.898
And I'm gonna start
with that stink ass whore

08:18.931 --> 08:21.167
you call your mom.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.135
This way she don't
go around polluting us

08:23.169 --> 08:26.739
with any fucking
greedy motherfuckers like you.

08:26.772 --> 08:27.974
Was there anything else?

08:28.007 --> 08:29.609
Can we finish
what we came here to do?

08:29.642 --> 08:32.178
I think we got everything
we came here to get.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.679
Let's go.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.585
Right on.
Come on.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.953
See you later, pig,
you fucking bitch.

08:44.790 --> 08:46.826
You know what?

08:46.859 --> 08:50.997
You know what,
I've had a change of heart.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.965
I'm gonna give you your cut.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.001
It's about time.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.669
Here it is.

09:06.679 --> 09:10.883
That wasn't so tough,
was it, detective?

09:25.398 --> 09:28.834
What the fuck?
Why did we do that?

09:28.868 --> 09:31.637
No witnesses.
We both agreed, no witnesses.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.406
Okay, one loose end's
gonna fuck everything up.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.007
Now, help me on this thing.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.409
Come on, let's not be
sentimental here.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.377
None these guys were angels,
not one of them.

09:38.411 --> 09:42.348
You fucking idiot.
You fucking idiot.

09:42.381 --> 09:44.850
We could've worn fucking masks.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.786
None of them would've known
who the fuck we were.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.721
All right, are you gonna risk
your life behind that?

09:48.754 --> 09:50.856
You gonna risk
Karen's life behind that?

09:50.890 --> 09:52.992
You're gonna risk Karen.
Is that what you're gonna do?

09:53.025 --> 09:55.294
Come on.
The geek squad...

09:55.328 --> 09:58.230
Shut the fuck up!
Is gonna show up.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.933
Shut up! They're
gonna be poking around.

10:00.967 --> 10:05.137
And this story
has got to be right.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.772
You gotta be right, Jackson.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.807
Fuck!

10:12.778 --> 10:13.846
Hello?

10:16.983 --> 10:18.384
Mr. Jamir?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.920
Look, I need the dolly back.

10:22.288 --> 10:23.656
Hello?

10:34.834 --> 10:37.703
Mr. Jamir!

10:45.177 --> 10:48.080
God damn it.
Why did you do that?

10:48.114 --> 10:50.783
My bad.
You wanna show him your badge?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.153
Oh, fuck.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.454
Somebody must've heard.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.823
Fuck, fuck.
Who the fuck is this guy?

10:57.857 --> 10:59.792
I don't know,
he's dead, you know?

11:02.962 --> 11:04.163
God damn it, I thought you said

11:04.196 --> 11:05.498
he was fucking dead!

11:05.531 --> 11:07.033
He was dead, he was dead,
he was very...

11:07.066 --> 11:08.768
You know he's not fucking dead.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.469
Are you going to fucking kill him now?
Shut up.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.239
I have a plan.
Grab his legs.

11:13.272 --> 11:15.074
Grab his legs.
Grab his fucking legs?

11:15.107 --> 11:18.077
Grab his legs, grab his legs.
Put your fucking gun away.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.178
What do you want me to do?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.479
Pull him over here.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.937
Let's get a blood type on him, stat.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.372
Okay, let's prep for surgery.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.478
20% morphine.
What are his vitals?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.948
What are we gonna do now?
Nothing's changed.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.251
Fuck that shit,
we got a live witness.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.886
He fucking saw us.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.587
Hey, you need to get
a hold of yourself

13:08.621 --> 13:10.356
and stick to the plan.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.391
Stick to the plan?
Oh, right.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.360
Fuck you, fuck your plan.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.328
This is a million dollar
fucking problem,

13:16.362 --> 13:18.397
I'm not gonna let you fuck it up for me.
You know what,

13:18.430 --> 13:20.399
you need to come with me
right now,

13:20.432 --> 13:24.003
to the little boys room.

13:24.036 --> 13:27.006
Everything's okay, right?
Right? Right!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.977
I fucking knew that this
whole blood bath idea of yours

13:32.011 --> 13:33.946
was bad fucking news.

13:33.979 --> 13:36.248
Now, instead of us
going down for robbery,

13:36.282 --> 13:37.983
they're gonna stick
a fucking needle in us.

13:38.017 --> 13:40.386
You listen to me, okay,
this could be a good thing.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.087
All right, we already have
a plan in place.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.889
It's just the situation
like this,

13:43.923 --> 13:45.558
if he stays alive,
we blame the thing on him.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.394
And we always said,
that it would be better, what?

13:48.427 --> 13:50.262
With a fall guy.

13:50.296 --> 13:54.300
Yeah. If he were
fucking dead, maybe.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.168
What if it doesn't work?

13:56.202 --> 13:57.603
What if they believe
his fucking story?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.038
Then what?

13:59.071 --> 14:01.106
I'm not gonna go
to fucking prison.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.975
You know what they do
to cops in prison?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.678
Hey, everything's
gonna be all right.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.279
Let's try to just stick
to the plan,

14:07.313 --> 14:09.048
and everything will be fine.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.983
Have I ever let you down before?

14:14.153 --> 14:16.288
No... no.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.556
No.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.592
All rise.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.060
The Superior Court
of Los Angeles

14:21.093 --> 14:22.928
is now in session.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.231
The honorable judge
William Spitzer presiding.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.166
You may be seated.

14:28.634 --> 14:31.303
Detective, will you please
explain to us,

14:31.337 --> 14:32.504
the events that transpired

14:32.538 --> 14:34.540
on the afternoon of January 5th.

14:34.573 --> 14:36.642
We responded
to a shots fired call.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.611
And you and your partner
were the first on the scene?

14:38.644 --> 14:42.481
That's correct.
So, what happened next?

14:42.514 --> 14:45.985
We entered the warehouse,
weapons drawn.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.554
At that time,
we saw the defendant

14:48.587 --> 14:52.057
standing over the bodies,
gun in hand.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.292
We ordered the defendant

14:53.325 --> 14:54.560
to place his weapon
on the floor.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.629
And what did the defendant
do then?

14:56.662 --> 14:58.497
The defendant raised his weapon,

14:58.530 --> 15:00.132
in a threatening manner.

15:00.165 --> 15:02.001
And my partner,

15:02.034 --> 15:04.003
thank god he acted accordingly.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.005
Which was how?

15:06.038 --> 15:08.207
He fired one shot
subduing the suspect,

15:08.240 --> 15:09.408
till backup arrived.

15:09.441 --> 15:11.410
Detective berg,

15:11.443 --> 15:14.046
you've been doing this job
a long time, haven't you?

15:14.079 --> 15:15.714
Seventeen years in august.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.284
So, it's safe to call you
a vetted detective?

15:18.317 --> 15:19.485
I'd like to think so.

15:19.518 --> 15:23.222
Six commendations for bravery,

15:23.255 --> 15:26.225
three certificates
from city hall.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.260
That's pretty impressive.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.396
I do what I can.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.031
Detective, are you aware

15:32.064 --> 15:34.366
that the defendant claims
that he saw you standing

15:34.400 --> 15:36.168
over the bodies of the dead men

15:36.201 --> 15:37.369
and that you and your partner

15:37.403 --> 15:38.737
are the real killers and not he?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.440
Objection, your honor.
Hearsay.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.374
Overruled.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.544
Detective, if you would.

15:45.577 --> 15:49.682
If I had a dime for every time
one of these scumbags

15:49.715 --> 15:53.485
expected us to save them
from their own stupidity,

15:53.519 --> 15:55.087
I don't think I'd need
the city's dime.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.588
Objection, your honor.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.457
This is anecdotal,
it's prejudicial.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.459
I mean, is this line
of questioning relevant

16:00.492 --> 16:02.361
in any way?
Your honor, the defense

16:02.394 --> 16:04.029
has made it relevant.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.764
They are pinning
the defendant's fate

16:05.798 --> 16:09.134
on the jury finding
two upstanding police officers

16:09.168 --> 16:10.469
guilty of murder.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.538
Now, Mr. Walker.

16:12.571 --> 16:15.574
You claim that you saw
detectives berg and Jackson

16:15.607 --> 16:17.443
standing over the bodies
of these men

16:17.476 --> 16:20.145
and that you were just there
to retrieve, um...

16:20.179 --> 16:22.448
what was it?
A dolly.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.084
Mr. walker, come on.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.785
Do you really expect us
to believe

16:26.819 --> 16:29.755
that two decorated policemen
robbed and killed these men

16:29.788 --> 16:32.091
and then in a most
callous fashion,

16:32.124 --> 16:35.361
shot you and framed you
for the crime?

16:35.394 --> 16:36.829
Yes.

16:36.862 --> 16:39.131
I know what I saw.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.566
Who's a more reliable witness

16:40.599 --> 16:43.068
a man accused of eight murders

16:43.102 --> 16:45.471
or one of the city's
most decorated detectives?

16:45.504 --> 16:48.340
Objection.
Your honor, please.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.776
Sustained.

16:50.809 --> 16:53.412
You're a father,
aren't you, Mr. Walker?

16:53.445 --> 16:55.547
Yeah. I am.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.082
But you're separated
from your wife,

16:57.116 --> 16:59.218
is that correct?

16:59.251 --> 17:01.420
It's just temporary.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.322
Oh, really?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.723
My records show that it's
been over a year.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.394
It seems pretty permanent to me.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.663
Child support is expensive,
isn't it, Mr. Walker.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.332
So?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.534
So my records also show
that you have been

17:15.567 --> 17:18.303
behind several payments.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.539
One more and you lose
visitation rights.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.574
Is there a point coming
any time soon?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.476
Yes, the point is,
Mr. Walker,

17:24.510 --> 17:25.844
you'd lost your wife

17:25.877 --> 17:27.846
and now you were gonna lose
your son too.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.415
All that money next door,

17:29.448 --> 17:31.650
it never even crossed your mind?

17:31.683 --> 17:33.352
You must've known
what was going on.

17:33.385 --> 17:38.257
Objection, your honor,
we have already established

17:38.290 --> 17:39.858
that there is
no concrete evidence

17:39.892 --> 17:43.495
whatsoever that Mr. Walker
had any idea

17:43.529 --> 17:45.230
of the goings on next door.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.799
What he did have was the motive

17:46.832 --> 17:47.833
and the opportunity.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.635
Come on, Mr. Walker.

17:49.668 --> 17:51.437
You saw what was
going on next door

17:51.470 --> 17:53.205
and you just couldn't
help yourself.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.908
You killed those men...
Objection, your honor.

17:55.941 --> 17:57.476
No!

17:59.178 --> 18:01.680
Will the defendant please rise.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.153
And how do you find?

18:08.187 --> 18:10.889
We the jury find the defendant
guilty on all accounts.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.358
Sam!
Dad!

18:13.392 --> 18:16.195
Dad! Dad!

18:16.228 --> 18:17.463
Dad!

18:17.496 --> 18:18.864
Order.
Sam!

18:18.897 --> 18:21.366
Order.
Let me go. Let me go.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.335
Order, order.
Sam!

18:23.368 --> 18:25.704
No!
Please stop.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.306
Order in the court.

18:34.546 --> 18:38.250
Oh, my god!

18:38.283 --> 18:39.618
What are you doing?

18:43.355 --> 18:45.224
Tell them, tell them the rest.
Tell them the rest.

18:45.257 --> 18:46.358
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.327
So I'm cuffing...

18:48.360 --> 18:50.929
Cuffing the guy,
and put him in the back

18:50.963 --> 18:51.964
of the car, right?

19:01.273 --> 19:03.242
I couldn't get the smell
out of my car...

19:19.691 --> 19:21.693
Hey, we fucking did it, man.
We did it, yeah.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.729
Fucking did it, dude.
Fucking did it.

19:23.762 --> 19:25.864
I'm gonna buy me a fuckin' boat.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.466
I'm gonna buy me a big ass boat.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.901
Just like, this fuckin' big.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.770
This big.
Hey, who likes boats?

19:31.803 --> 19:34.973
Woo!
I hate fucking boats.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.343
Boats make me seasick, man.
Come on, right.

19:38.377 --> 19:40.846
What a pussy.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.348
Yeah, yeah.
What a pussy.

19:43.382 --> 19:47.686
Yeah, what a pussy.
Whoa.

19:49.454 --> 19:53.025
What a pussy.

19:53.058 --> 19:56.295
Hey! Hey!
Huh, what?

19:56.328 --> 19:59.498
Hey, you get your hands
off my wife you piece of shit

19:59.531 --> 20:00.766
or I'll fucking kill you.

20:00.799 --> 20:02.868
Oh, yeah?
You're gonna kill me?

20:02.901 --> 20:04.269
Freeze!

20:12.744 --> 20:15.447
Shit. Sorry.
Excuse me.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.987
Fuck.
Get the fuck off me.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.492
Don't worry, little bitch.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.628
You're gonna feel right as rain.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.670
What'd I tell you?
Right as rain.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.678
Look at her, shit.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.648
You're a wanker.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.595
Get it out, get it out. Right.
Just breathe.

21:05.063 --> 21:09.468
Somebody call a nurse.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.902
God damn,
on top of the world my friend.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.404
Mm.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.473
Where'd your date go?
Hey man,

21:14.506 --> 21:15.707
I fucked her in the bathroom,

21:15.741 --> 21:17.075
I paid her off, she went home.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.944
She was the perfect hooker.

21:21.713 --> 21:23.782
Hey, hey, you know
what they say, right?

21:23.815 --> 21:26.418
What's that?
You don't pay 'em to stay.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.986
You pay 'em to leave.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.622
To leave. Absolutely.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.165
Anything I can do for you?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.537
You know,
you guys should really call

21:45.570 --> 21:47.105
before you come over.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.941
Then I would've
at least cleaned up first.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.045
One of those guys you killed,

21:53.078 --> 21:54.112
is my cousin.

21:54.146 --> 21:58.650
Huh?

21:58.684 --> 22:01.053
What? You have nothing
to say?

22:01.086 --> 22:03.155
Come on!

22:03.188 --> 22:08.093
Well, it seems to me
like your family tree

22:08.126 --> 22:10.929
is really good
at producing assholes.

22:10.962 --> 22:13.065
He's a funny guy.
Real funny.

22:13.098 --> 22:15.167
Yeah,
you wanna laugh. Okay.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.635
We're gonna laugh together.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.070
Is this funny to you,
motherfucker?

22:18.103 --> 22:21.506
You smell that? You smell it?

22:21.540 --> 22:22.974
You're gonna burn
tonight, bitch.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.110
Roast his ass.
I'm gonna fucking roast...

22:26.645 --> 22:28.113
Do not!

22:30.482 --> 22:32.984
Ferdinand, how many times
do I have to tell you

22:33.018 --> 22:34.786
this is not ol' Mexico

22:34.820 --> 22:39.191
and you are not Pablo Escobar?

22:39.224 --> 22:40.959
I'm Lebanese, bro.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.628
Same difference.

22:43.662 --> 22:45.597
Give it up.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.070
Get out of here.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.806
Don't go too far, sweetie.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.109
I'm coming for you soon, bitch.

23:07.519 --> 23:09.988
Not so fast.

23:10.021 --> 23:11.923
You didn't really think that
was the end of it

23:11.957 --> 23:13.492
did you?

23:15.527 --> 23:19.765
Oh, I wanna be inside you
just once more.

23:19.798 --> 23:24.736
And tonight I was wondering,

23:24.770 --> 23:27.105
would you mind
if I shaved your ass?

23:30.075 --> 23:32.611
I have a long afternoon
planned for us.

23:40.118 --> 23:42.120
I'm home, Lucy.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.925
Man, Chris, you better have
a good ass reason

23:46.958 --> 23:49.060
for missing pork chop night.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.863
Them shits
was good as hell, Nig.

23:51.897 --> 23:53.198
Anyway, you don't want
'em next time,

23:53.231 --> 23:54.733
send 'em my way.

23:54.766 --> 23:57.836
Lights out, jimmy.
Yes sir, boss, yes sir.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.271
The fuck's his problem?
Hey!

23:59.304 --> 24:02.607
He's got bad diarrhea, boss.
Real, real, bad.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.576
You know the food 'round here?

24:04.609 --> 24:05.677
Matter a fact, I'd do my best

24:05.710 --> 24:07.012
to stay up wind if I was you.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.247
Yeah, lights out, boys.
Bunk up.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.817
Yes, sir.
Bunk, bunk it up.

24:14.052 --> 24:17.055
Don't you worry, dude.

24:17.088 --> 24:20.625
I told you I got your back.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.595
Yes, sir, you're gonna need
ol' jimmy 'round here.

24:23.628 --> 24:25.931
I'm gonna be your best friend.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.214
Chris, what the fuck's
that smell?

24:42.247 --> 24:45.684
Oh, oh!
Oh! Shit! Shit!

24:45.717 --> 24:47.319
Hey, guard! Guards!

24:47.352 --> 24:48.787
What the fuck is wrong?

25:01.366 --> 25:03.201
These allegations of corruption

25:03.235 --> 25:05.170
have marred the city's
once storied

25:05.203 --> 25:07.205
police department for months.

25:07.239 --> 25:10.041
After over ten indictments
being handed down so far

25:10.075 --> 25:12.911
the department is left
scratching their heads,

25:12.944 --> 25:14.813
trying to find
an underlying cause

25:14.846 --> 25:18.183
for this seemingly rampant
misuse of power.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.718
Now I'm here live at city hall

25:19.751 --> 25:22.153
with commander Rocco
of the LAPD.

25:22.187 --> 25:24.589
Commander, sir,
what exactly can you tell us

25:24.623 --> 25:28.793
about this seemingly
irreversible trend of corruption

25:28.827 --> 25:30.662
that we are witnessing?
Well, first of all,

25:30.695 --> 25:32.297
I'd like
to respectfully disagree

25:32.330 --> 25:33.899
with that statement.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.200
It's always wrong
to judge the many

25:35.233 --> 25:37.002
by the actions of a few.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.672
But commander, ten indictments
over the past ten months,

25:40.705 --> 25:42.941
I would hardly call
that the few.

25:42.974 --> 25:44.376
Well, I'd like to point out
that there's

25:44.409 --> 25:46.978
an internal investigation
currently underway

25:47.012 --> 25:49.047
to get to the bottom
of these allegations.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.349
And until that investigation
is concluded,

25:51.383 --> 25:53.151
no one will have the full story.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.020
Including myself.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.721
And I would also like
to reiterate

25:56.755 --> 25:59.324
that this department
is run by caring, talented,

25:59.357 --> 26:01.927
intelligent,
and well-trained individuals,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.996
who as a whole,
embody that which is needed

26:05.030 --> 26:07.365
to truly serve and protect
the citizens of this city.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.234
I can assure you
those individuals

26:09.267 --> 26:10.869
that would use
this badge as a cover

26:10.902 --> 26:12.837
to perpetrate
unlawful activities,

26:12.871 --> 26:15.373
their day has come,
and justice will be swift.

26:21.846 --> 26:24.783
Oh, no.

26:24.816 --> 26:28.186
Oh. Hi.
Good morning, banks.

26:28.219 --> 26:30.822
Oh, do you think
it's really safe for him

26:30.855 --> 26:33.124
to be playing
with that little thing?

26:33.158 --> 26:37.896
Despite Jeffrey's
IQ, or lack thereof,

26:37.929 --> 26:41.933
his loyalty
remains unquestioned.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.935
Something you know
nothing about.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.870
You're three weeks late.

26:45.904 --> 26:47.739
How many times
do I have to tell you

26:47.772 --> 26:51.776
to stop this welching stuff.

26:51.810 --> 26:56.081
You are an unlucky fuck.

26:56.114 --> 26:59.985
But you insist on hanging out
at the track,

27:00.018 --> 27:02.454
spending my money,

27:02.487 --> 27:05.724
picking losers.

27:05.757 --> 27:08.760
So, I have to ask myself,

27:08.793 --> 27:10.328
why would someone do this to me?

27:10.362 --> 27:14.165
Is it because
they don't like me?

27:14.199 --> 27:15.800
Is it because when you
look at me,

27:15.834 --> 27:18.269
you don't see
a serious individual?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.238
You know what,
I'm a police officer.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.307
And if anybody saw this
they might say

27:22.340 --> 27:24.109
that it's assaulting
a police officer.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.710
Yeah, and priests

27:25.744 --> 27:27.045
are supposed to be good
with kids,

27:27.078 --> 27:31.850
but things aren't always
what they seem.

27:31.883 --> 27:34.419
I'm tell you what,

27:34.452 --> 27:36.454
cop, no cop,

27:36.488 --> 27:41.326
this is going
to happen every time.

27:41.359 --> 27:45.430
That is until you wise up
and learn that badge of yours,

27:45.463 --> 27:47.265
doesn't mean shit
if it's standing in the way

27:47.298 --> 27:49.167
of my money.

27:55.306 --> 27:57.208
Friday, berg.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.311
Or we start lopping off parts.

28:02.480 --> 28:07.018
Friday, berg.
Don't test me on this.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.854
<i>âª Hey now
you better listen to me âª</i>

28:09.888 --> 28:12.223
<i>âª Everyone of you âª</i>

28:12.257 --> 28:14.526

28:19.130 --> 28:22.167
<i>âª And that water can âª</i>

28:42.554 --> 28:45.323
<i>âª I wanna see everybody

28:45.356 --> 28:48.226
Ouch, ouch.
That's your fault.

28:48.259 --> 28:51.029
Ouch.
Hey.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.331
Good morning.
I'm almost done.

28:53.364 --> 28:55.066
Okay.
All right.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.501
What are you doing here, berg?

28:56.534 --> 28:58.236
Don't you got a home
of your own to go to?

28:58.269 --> 29:00.004
Hey, man. You
know, I couldn't sleep

29:00.038 --> 29:01.139
so I thought I'd come over here

29:01.172 --> 29:03.241
and pop a couple in the misses

29:03.274 --> 29:04.843
before you got home.

29:04.876 --> 29:07.212
You know.
Oh, that's very nice of you.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.346
Maybe you can take a shower

29:08.379 --> 29:09.581
before coming over next time.

29:09.614 --> 29:10.982
Ooh, damn.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.383
Is he always this funny
in the morning?

29:12.417 --> 29:14.819
Oh, I wouldn't know these days.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.454
He didn't come home last night.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.423
I got stuck
doing some paperwork.

29:18.456 --> 29:20.325
Yeah, you know,

29:20.358 --> 29:21.559
I dropped the ball,

29:21.593 --> 29:25.530
so, my man, Jackson
covered my ass.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.832
As you do.
Yeah.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.567
Mm, yeah, I'm sure he did.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.405
Yeah, well, I hate to interrupt

29:34.439 --> 29:35.974
this wonderful awkward moment

29:36.007 --> 29:37.175
but we've got a job to do.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.510
You know, that you thing you do,

29:38.543 --> 29:40.612
like eight days a week.

29:40.645 --> 29:42.247
Yeah, I'll meet you outside.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.982
Cool.
See you in the car.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.592
Hey.

30:14.913 --> 30:17.015
My man, thanks
for that cover story,

30:17.048 --> 30:18.449
that shit worked out perfect.

30:18.483 --> 30:22.120
Yeah, that's
what partners are for.

30:22.153 --> 30:25.456
Who was it this time?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.559
None of your god damn business.

30:27.592 --> 30:31.196
Oh, yeah.
You rocking that tranny again.

30:31.229 --> 30:33.231
I told you, you gotta check

30:33.264 --> 30:36.067
for that adam's apple
before you pay up.

30:36.100 --> 30:39.304
Yeah, you're the expert.
Yeah, right.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.243
They need that report
in an hour.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.252
Jesus, berg, you look like shit.

30:54.285 --> 30:57.555
Thank you, commander.

30:57.589 --> 31:00.225
I need you guys
to get it together.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.327
'Cause I'm sure
you've seen the news.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.929
A bunch of ungrateful assholes
if you ask me.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.366
Yeah, well, nobody asked you.

31:08.399 --> 31:12.270
Now, I need you both
to be on your best behavior.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.571
Because as you can see,

31:13.605 --> 31:15.473
I kinda got my hands
full around here.

31:15.506 --> 31:18.209
And a response
to all of this bullshit,

31:18.243 --> 31:21.112
the mayor has appointed
a special task force

31:21.145 --> 31:24.315
to investigate
police corruption citywide.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.151
Yeah, I heard about that.
Cocksuckers.

31:27.185 --> 31:29.554
What?
It's what?

31:29.587 --> 31:32.190
Oh, I said, cocksuckers, sir.
You know what, that's enough.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.524
'Cause I don't care
how you guys feel

31:33.558 --> 31:35.093
about this either way,

31:35.126 --> 31:37.395
you're both gonna fully
cooperate with la

31:37.428 --> 31:39.063
just like everybody else.

31:39.097 --> 31:42.033
You're gonna give them
everything they need,

31:42.066 --> 31:46.537
including showing up on time
for your fucking interviews.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.073
Berg...

31:49.107 --> 31:51.643
Don't let me
chase you down, okay?

31:51.676 --> 31:54.245
'Cause I'll gladly drag
you back here in cuffs

31:54.279 --> 31:55.480
if that's what it takes

31:55.513 --> 31:57.715
to get this pain
in my ass removed.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.451
What do they want with us?

32:00.485 --> 32:02.420
They want to conduct
a simple interview,

32:02.453 --> 32:03.688
just like everybody else.

32:03.721 --> 32:06.224
Well, there's gotta be a reason.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.226
What's the matter with you guys?

32:08.259 --> 32:10.595
You know, I'll tell you what,
surprise me.

32:10.628 --> 32:13.131
Do me a favor,
go out and solve a crime,

32:13.164 --> 32:15.366
catch a crook, go do something.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.734
Act like cops.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.203
Should we blow them
as well, commander?

32:21.072 --> 32:23.308
Berg, let me tell you
something right now.

32:23.341 --> 32:24.475
I'm not kidding,

32:24.509 --> 32:26.711
if they tell you to dress
in drag,

32:26.744 --> 32:30.415
you break out
the fucking lipstick.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.150
Commander, there's something

32:32.183 --> 32:34.285
that I've been meaning
to ask you.

32:34.319 --> 32:38.556
You use that expression
a lot, and...

32:38.589 --> 32:40.458
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

32:40.491 --> 32:44.329
is there something that
you're trying to tell us?

32:44.362 --> 32:47.332
You can tell me.
I won't tell anyone.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.272
Carry on.

32:54.305 --> 32:57.575
He's never laughed one time

32:57.608 --> 32:59.210
at anything I've ever said.

32:59.243 --> 33:00.778
Hey guys, got something
for you too.

33:00.812 --> 33:04.716
Give me, give me.
Give me, give me, give me.

33:04.749 --> 33:07.318
Oh, fuck. Come on,
this is a crank.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.754
What? Hey, she called,
and asked for you by name.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.789
If you ask me,
I think she's a fucking nut.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.570
No milk, hope
you guys take it black.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.605
Yeah, sure.

33:27.638 --> 33:32.310
Is this a fuckin' joke?

33:32.343 --> 33:34.112
So, Mrs. Valdez,

33:34.145 --> 33:37.181
you said that you
just found this?

33:37.215 --> 33:39.183
That's right,

33:39.217 --> 33:41.519
I went out this morning
to get the paper.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.422
And there it was,
right on my porch.

33:44.455 --> 33:45.790
If you ask me,

33:45.823 --> 33:48.192
I think the good lord
is tempting me.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.129
Oh, right,
by sending you heroin?

33:51.162 --> 33:54.232
Honey, you ever tried heroin?

33:54.265 --> 33:56.834
No, Ma'am.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.470
Then what the fuck
do you know about it?

34:04.709 --> 34:08.446
So, ms. Valdez,

34:09.746 --> 34:14.652
why exactly did you ask for us?

34:14.685 --> 34:16.687
The package told me to.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.262
Here. See.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.396
Uh-huh.

34:32.837 --> 34:36.674
So, where do you think
it came from?

34:36.706 --> 34:39.710
There's a crazy old bitch
that has a brick of heroin

34:39.744 --> 34:40.844
that we fuckin' stole.

34:40.878 --> 34:42.380
Do you want me to calm down?

34:42.413 --> 34:43.815
Okay, we don't know
that for sure.

34:43.848 --> 34:46.317
Yeah, right.
It's just a coincidence,

34:46.350 --> 34:47.518
that this brick of heroin

34:47.552 --> 34:49.454
has the same fucking
Chinese shit

34:49.487 --> 34:53.458
as the shit
that we fuckin' stole.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.493
How are you not
more upset at this?

35:00.698 --> 35:04.302
Where are we going now?

35:04.335 --> 35:05.503
Guess.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.383
All the money's just gone.

35:52.416 --> 35:53.718
All the fuckin' junk,
it's just gone.

35:53.751 --> 35:56.787
All of last year
is down the drain.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.823
Fuck this sure as shit
is not happening.

35:58.856 --> 36:01.492
It is happening.
It is happening.

36:01.526 --> 36:03.661
No else knew about it
except you and me.

36:05.963 --> 36:08.432
Fuck, man!

36:15.606 --> 36:19.644
You think I took the money?

36:19.677 --> 36:21.913
You got a better explanation?

36:23.047 --> 36:23.948
Yeah.

36:25.583 --> 36:29.220
There's somebody
that's fucking with us.

36:31.589 --> 36:33.958
Why would I steal from us?

36:33.991 --> 36:36.961
I'm in this shit
just as deep as you are.

36:36.994 --> 36:39.497
And I'm your fucking partner.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.506
Oh, shit.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.476
$4 million dollars.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.848
Really good job.
Thank you, sir.

36:57.882 --> 36:59.784
Both of you. Really.

36:59.817 --> 37:01.018
Okay, everybody.
Back to work.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.054
Appreciate it,
thank you so much.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.490
Police work at its best, baby.

37:06.524 --> 37:07.725
Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies.

37:07.758 --> 37:09.327
What's the cackling all about?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.528
Oh, not much,

37:10.561 --> 37:12.430
just your average 42 kilo bust,

37:12.463 --> 37:14.365
that's all.
Hah, yeah.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.334
Our records say
that this was part

37:16.367 --> 37:18.869
of a shipment
that was stolen last year.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.706
Hello?
Anybody home?

37:21.739 --> 37:23.507
So, where'd they get it
shipped from?

37:23.541 --> 37:25.409
Oh, some low-level thug.

37:25.443 --> 37:28.446
Man, we got him over
in interrogation right now.

37:28.479 --> 37:29.780
Yeah, but what gets to me
is you know,

37:29.814 --> 37:31.782
how does a lowlife like him

37:31.816 --> 37:35.086
get a hold of this much weight?

37:35.119 --> 37:37.021
We're gonna take a
crack at him after lunch.

37:37.054 --> 37:39.423
Let him sweat it out
a little bit.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.025
Hey, you guys wanna come
join us?

37:41.058 --> 37:42.727
We're gonna celebrate.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.662
We got some loose ends
to tie up,

37:44.695 --> 37:47.465
but we'll definitely take
a rain check on that one.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.799
Okay, well, suit yourself.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.334
But, hey, if you guys
are free later,

37:50.368 --> 37:51.535
come on by and watch

37:51.569 --> 37:52.903
two real detectives put it down,

37:52.937 --> 37:55.606
because we are going
to lay into that guy.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.843
'Cause I'm tellin' ya,
that guy...

37:58.876 --> 38:01.345
he's hiding something.

38:01.379 --> 38:06.117
Detectives.
Congrats, congrats.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.786
All to us.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.066
Wakey, wakey. Hello?

38:22.099 --> 38:25.136
Hi. Sorry to disturb you.
I'm berg.

38:25.169 --> 38:28.739
I want my fuckin' phone call.
You understand?

38:28.773 --> 38:31.842
Now, Chavez, I have a very...

38:31.876 --> 38:33.878
simple question
for you, the drugs.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.413
Where did they come from?

38:35.446 --> 38:36.981
I don't know anything
about no drugs

38:37.014 --> 38:39.950
I told your other two partners
that I don't know shit.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.987
What the fuck,
I want my fucking phone call.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.523
You know, I am a professional.

38:45.556 --> 38:49.093
As a professional,
I really kind of pride myself

38:49.126 --> 38:50.961
on playing by the book.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.663
So, what I'm gonna do

38:52.697 --> 38:55.700
is I'm going to play
by the book.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.835
Okay?

38:57.868 --> 39:02.640
Here's the book.
And now we're going to play.

39:02.673 --> 39:06.711
"Rules regarding tactics
of manipulation

39:06.744 --> 39:09.814
and interrogation techniques
volume three."

39:09.847 --> 39:11.148
that's a mouth full.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.650
Look, I don't know what the fuck

39:12.683 --> 39:14.852
you're talking about.

39:14.885 --> 39:18.089
I don't wanna have to go
to volume four.

39:18.122 --> 39:21.559
Oh, sir, I didn't realize you
were in here with... no problem.

39:21.592 --> 39:22.993
We would like
some privacy though,

39:23.027 --> 39:25.496
my friend and I were just...

39:25.529 --> 39:27.765
just getting
acquainted actually.

39:27.798 --> 39:30.201
That's the thing, sir.
This fuck just posted bail.

39:30.234 --> 39:32.903
Shit. Who posted it?

39:32.937 --> 39:34.438
You're not gonna believe this,
sir,

39:34.472 --> 39:35.673
but it was posted anonymously.

39:35.706 --> 39:37.541
Anonymous.

39:39.810 --> 39:40.978
Interesting.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.884
Okay. I guess
we gotta let him go.

39:46.917 --> 39:50.721
Now, you might wanna get him
a band-aid.

39:50.755 --> 39:53.124
He had a little boo-boo.

39:53.157 --> 39:55.459
What the fuck happened
back there?

39:55.493 --> 39:56.794
Oh, man, I told you,

39:56.827 --> 39:58.662
that barney fire
stepped in there,

39:58.696 --> 40:00.765
interrupted us
before I could get anything.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.566
Fuck, he didn't say anything?

40:02.600 --> 40:03.801
Nah, he didn't say anything

40:03.834 --> 40:06.937
but he knows
a whole bunch of shit.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.607
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do now?

40:09.640 --> 40:12.209
Posted, right?
Right.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.045
He's a free man, right?

40:15.079 --> 40:18.549
So you can get anything you
want out of a free man.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.185
As long as you apply
the right amount of pressure.

40:39.136 --> 40:40.604
Hey, where you going, bitch?

40:45.810 --> 40:47.111
Hey, man. You know me,
do you know me?

40:47.144 --> 40:48.879
You know me, don't you?

40:48.913 --> 40:50.848
You stole from me,
right, motherfucker? Huh?

40:50.881 --> 40:53.050
Asshole, pendejo... I didn't
steal shit from you, man.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.752
I didn't fucking steal shit
from you guys.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.554
You know what?
You agitating me.

40:56.587 --> 40:58.255
You shouldn't do that.
You shouldn't agitate me.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.257
Now, if you didn't take
the shit,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.560
where the shit come from?

41:06.330 --> 41:08.766
Man, I don't fucking know.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.134
I don't fucking know.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.303
I didn't fucking
take shit from you.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.540
You don't know anything
about the money, hmm?

41:16.574 --> 41:18.843
You know what, I got a boy
here who will teach you

41:18.876 --> 41:20.177
what we do to people

41:20.211 --> 41:22.112
who don't know nothing
about nothing.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.882
Go ahead, boy. Go ahead. You
want me to go ahead right now?

41:24.915 --> 41:26.617
Uh-huh. Hit him.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.086
Listen, man.
You gotta fucking believe me.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.188
I don't know shit.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.891
That's it, there it is.

41:33.924 --> 41:35.092
See, okay.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.161
Behind door number one
we have...

41:37.194 --> 41:39.763
uh-huh.

41:39.797 --> 41:42.800
And behind door number two
what we gonna do?

41:42.833 --> 41:45.069
Mm-hmm.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.237
You know, fuck you, man.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.038
Fuck you!
Hey, no, fuck you.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.206
I fucking told you,

41:49.240 --> 41:50.641
I didn't fucking steal from you.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.210
Fuck you.
You're fucked right now.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.346
You feel that?
All right, all right.

41:55.379 --> 41:57.615
All right, all right.

41:57.648 --> 41:58.883
All right, I'll tell you.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.651
It was just there.
It was just there.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.587
Left on my doorstep.

42:04.989 --> 42:06.223
What you say?

42:09.927 --> 42:11.595
I was at my house on the couch.
Right.

42:11.629 --> 42:12.930
All right,
I was just hanging out

42:12.963 --> 42:15.065
and I hear a fucking knock
on the door.

42:15.099 --> 42:18.168
I open the fucking door
and the shit was just there.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.904
And you're thinking
it was crazy.

42:19.937 --> 42:21.272
That a whole boatload of smack

42:21.305 --> 42:23.173
was left on your doorstep?

42:23.207 --> 42:25.042
I just figured that somebody
wanted me to have it.

42:25.075 --> 42:27.945
That's the fucking truth.

42:29.113 --> 42:30.681
Are you lying?

42:30.714 --> 42:32.283
Why the fuck don't you guys
believe me?

42:32.316 --> 42:34.285
Oh, shit. He's fucking lying.
Why the fuck...

42:34.318 --> 42:35.619
No, he's...

42:35.653 --> 42:38.756
Berg! I know
you're in there.

42:38.789 --> 42:41.191
Your car is out here.

42:41.225 --> 42:44.094
Help!
Shh.

42:44.128 --> 42:48.999
Berg!

42:49.033 --> 42:52.369
Berg, berg? Oh, fuck,
this motherfuckin' banks,

42:52.403 --> 42:55.839
god damn.
The fuck?

42:55.873 --> 42:57.908
That's fucking banks?

42:57.942 --> 42:58.909
Berg!

42:58.943 --> 43:01.078
Yeah, banks.

43:01.111 --> 43:02.980
It's a hell of a time
for your gambling

43:03.013 --> 43:05.382
to be a fucking problem.
Yeah, you know something,

43:05.416 --> 43:07.017
if they hadn't stolen
the fuckin' money,

43:07.051 --> 43:09.053
I would've paid off
the motherfucker by now.

43:09.086 --> 43:12.923
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

43:12.957 --> 43:15.092
Oh, fuck.

43:15.125 --> 43:17.094
Shh, shh, shh.

43:17.127 --> 43:20.230
I'm gonna go take care of it.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.900
If he makes a fucking peep,
blow his fucking head off.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.705
Okay.
Okay. Okay.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.406
No problem with that one.

43:29.440 --> 43:32.076
No problem.

43:33.310 --> 43:35.045
Who does your hair, man?

43:40.217 --> 43:43.053
Banksy, what can I do
for you guys?

43:43.087 --> 43:44.855
You can start by telling him

43:44.888 --> 43:47.424
to get his fucking ass out here.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.327
He's not here.
That's fine.

43:50.361 --> 43:52.262
Then you won't mind if we
have a little look around

43:52.296 --> 43:55.966
just to confirm
this tale of yours.

43:59.770 --> 44:01.138
Do you mind
coming back tomorrow...

44:01.171 --> 44:03.841
I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to insist.

44:06.377 --> 44:08.278
All right.

44:12.783 --> 44:15.419
What the fuck is going on here?

44:19.957 --> 44:23.327
Oh, shit!

44:32.836 --> 44:34.938
What the fuck is wrong with you?

44:34.972 --> 44:37.174
Why'd you shoot
that fucking piece of shit?

44:37.207 --> 44:40.077
You know what, they saw him

44:40.110 --> 44:42.046
so they gonna blackmail me.

44:42.079 --> 44:43.981
So, they're not
gonna blackmail me now,

44:44.014 --> 44:45.449
are they, huh?

44:45.482 --> 44:47.518
Piece of shit motherfucker.

44:47.551 --> 44:49.486
Howdy doody looking
motherfucker.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.422
Fuck him.
Shut up! Shut...

44:51.455 --> 44:54.958
Shut up, man! Stop!

44:54.992 --> 44:56.493
All right?

44:56.527 --> 44:58.395
I can't fucking
go home like this.

44:58.429 --> 44:59.997
I've got a spare shirt
in the trunk.

45:00.030 --> 45:03.367
So, fuck it, man.
Come on, relax.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.071
Help! Help me!

45:07.104 --> 45:09.073
What are we gonna do
with that piece of shit?

45:26.190 --> 45:28.926
After all that
you're still a piece of...

45:44.575 --> 45:46.009
Yes.

45:46.043 --> 45:49.379
Easy! Motherfucker!

45:49.413 --> 45:52.182
Fuck you.

45:52.216 --> 45:53.417
Fuck.

46:34.024 --> 46:36.026
Oh, fuck.

46:36.059 --> 46:40.164
Oh, fuck, yeah.

46:54.077 --> 46:56.480
Hey, babe.

46:56.513 --> 46:57.481
Hey.

47:00.384 --> 47:02.419
Hey. How was your day?

47:02.452 --> 47:04.054
If I never see
another text book again,

47:04.087 --> 47:06.490
it'll be too soon.

47:06.523 --> 47:08.192
Whoa, what are you doing?

47:08.225 --> 47:11.562
I wanna watch some TV
before I go to bed.

47:11.595 --> 47:13.030
I'm still pretty wired.

47:13.063 --> 47:16.300
What about me?

47:16.333 --> 47:17.367
Aw.

47:18.468 --> 47:20.604
Poor baby.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.342
You know, we're both so busy.

47:25.375 --> 47:27.945
I know.
I miss you.

47:30.247 --> 47:32.282
Come here.

48:20.364 --> 48:21.665
I'm thinking
maybe we should go back

48:21.698 --> 48:24.034
to the beginning on this thing.

48:24.067 --> 48:26.103
What are you talking about?

48:26.136 --> 48:28.505
Maybe go back to that Ci
you know.

48:28.538 --> 48:29.706
The one who tipped us off

48:29.740 --> 48:32.109
to the shipment
in the first place.

48:32.142 --> 48:33.443
You think that's a good idea?

48:33.477 --> 48:36.580
You got a better one?

48:36.613 --> 48:38.982
That's where we're going.

48:39.016 --> 48:40.484
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

48:40.517 --> 48:42.419
What's up?
Wait, wait.

48:45.656 --> 48:48.125
It's flat.
You bullshit.

48:48.158 --> 48:51.094
It's flat!
You bullshit!

48:51.128 --> 48:53.463
Oh, fuck!

48:54.665 --> 48:56.700
All right, let's change it.

48:56.733 --> 48:59.770
Go ahead.
You change it.

48:59.803 --> 49:02.005
You change
the motherfucking tire.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.418
Is this your idea
of a fucking joke?

49:14.451 --> 49:16.753
What are you
talking about? What?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.689
Oh, shit.

49:18.722 --> 49:20.490
That wasn't here
this morning, man.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.360
You think?
Yes, official.

49:23.393 --> 49:24.695
Somebody's royally
fucking with us,

49:24.728 --> 49:25.696
right about now.

49:25.729 --> 49:27.431
God...

49:27.464 --> 49:29.266
What... what are we gonna do now?

49:29.299 --> 49:32.436
We're not gonna do shit
on three tires, man.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.037
Fucking change it.

49:34.071 --> 49:35.605
Oh, yeah,
that's a brilliant idea, man.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.541
Why don't you dig down
and get that spare tire

49:37.574 --> 49:39.276
from underneath
those dead fucking bodies

49:39.309 --> 49:42.012
and I'll get the coffee.
Shut the fuck up.

49:45.582 --> 49:47.718
Shut up.

49:47.751 --> 49:50.420
Fuck, this is so fucked.

49:52.456 --> 49:56.226
Hi, may I have a number
for a tow truck, please.

49:56.259 --> 49:59.196
So, I woke up
early this morning,

49:59.229 --> 50:02.499
to get the DVD
and it wasn't there.

50:02.532 --> 50:04.301
Okay, you don't think
Karen could've...

50:04.334 --> 50:05.502
no, she didn't.

50:05.535 --> 50:07.137
I watched her all fucking night.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.339
She didn't move.

50:09.373 --> 50:12.743
This motherfucker
was in my house, berg.

50:12.776 --> 50:15.312
He was in my house.

50:16.780 --> 50:18.782
Look, let's go to your Ci,
all right?

50:18.815 --> 50:20.484
Get some information
and maybe you can

50:20.517 --> 50:21.818
get to the bottom of this thing,

50:21.852 --> 50:24.521
figure out what the fuck
is going on around here.

50:24.554 --> 50:26.556
Well, what if he can't?

50:26.590 --> 50:28.592
Hey! No!
Whoa, hey!

50:28.625 --> 50:31.194
The spare?
No spare.

50:31.228 --> 50:33.363
Necesitamos...

50:33.397 --> 50:34.531
nuevo spare.

50:34.564 --> 50:37.067
Nuevo. Gracias.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.540
You know, be real respectful.

50:46.343 --> 50:49.246
Hey, come on.
Come on.

50:53.750 --> 50:55.252
Nice look.

50:55.285 --> 50:57.487
So, this guy's
a little out there.

50:57.521 --> 50:59.856
So, just me do all the talking.

51:07.864 --> 51:12.369
Hey, Jerry.
Shh. Is it Tuesday?

51:12.402 --> 51:15.605
No, buddy.
Today's Thursday.

51:15.639 --> 51:19.376
Oh.
Can I have a dollar?

51:19.409 --> 51:22.145
Jerry, I'm gonna need you
to focus, okay?

51:22.179 --> 51:23.480
Now, are you gonna let us in

51:23.513 --> 51:25.215
or make us
stand out here all day?

51:28.819 --> 51:32.222
Who's the corpse?

51:32.255 --> 51:34.925
Man, have you looked
in a mirror recently?

51:34.958 --> 51:36.827
Oh, he's got
kind of an attitude problem,

51:36.860 --> 51:39.162
doesn't he? He does
have an attitude problem.

51:39.196 --> 51:40.864
But he's cool.
Okay, he's my partner.

51:40.897 --> 51:42.599
I trust him with my life.

51:42.632 --> 51:44.501
I don't like him.

51:44.534 --> 51:46.369
His face, it's...

51:46.403 --> 51:47.804
it's not good.

51:47.838 --> 51:50.474
Hey, fuck you, motherfucker.

51:50.507 --> 51:51.741
Look at you.
Calm down. Stop.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.610
Jerry, Jerry.
Yeah?

51:53.643 --> 51:56.346
Look, I apologize, he's cool.
Please, Jerry, let us in.

51:56.379 --> 51:58.682
I need to talk to you, okay?

51:58.715 --> 52:03.386
Okay, but don't touch my stuff.

52:03.420 --> 52:05.655
I have it organized
just the way I like it.

52:05.689 --> 52:07.491
He's not gonna touch shit.
Okay.

52:07.524 --> 52:09.826
Don't touch his shit.
No one's touching anything.

52:09.860 --> 52:12.696
Okay.
Okay.

52:12.729 --> 52:15.298
What the fuck you
tell him about my face?

52:15.332 --> 52:16.533
Man, get it together.

52:16.566 --> 52:18.468
Okay?
Fuck him,

52:18.502 --> 52:21.671
motherfuckin' Addam's family
lookin' motherfucker.

52:21.705 --> 52:22.873
Fuck that shit.

52:22.906 --> 52:25.976
Talking about my face...
Oh, shit.

52:26.009 --> 52:28.945
God damn,
we're dying up in here, man.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.848
Huh, what the fuck is this?

52:31.882 --> 52:34.351
What is this shit?
Shh.

52:34.384 --> 52:38.989
Hey Jerry, do me a
favor and shut the fuck up.

52:39.022 --> 52:40.790
Just be chill, man.
Don't worry about it.

52:40.824 --> 52:44.361
So, gentlemen,
what do I owe the pleasure

52:44.394 --> 52:45.428
of the visit?

52:46.730 --> 52:48.765
Shut the fuck up, damn it.

52:48.798 --> 52:50.867
Don't make me come over there.

52:50.901 --> 52:53.603
Well, so, don't mind her.

52:53.637 --> 52:56.239
She's just mad
because she weighs...

52:56.273 --> 52:57.574
600 pounds!

52:57.607 --> 52:59.643
And she's too fat
to get out of bed!

52:59.676 --> 53:00.810
Ha!

53:02.345 --> 53:05.382
I know.
The smell, right?

53:05.415 --> 53:07.417
Yeah, I know.
It's horrible.

53:07.450 --> 53:08.718
I don't know how some people

53:08.752 --> 53:13.623
let themselves get that way.

53:13.657 --> 53:16.326
So, you guys,
you guys want some coffee?

53:16.359 --> 53:18.395
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.898
This motherfucker...

53:21.932 --> 53:24.768
can you tell me
what the fuck I'm looking at?

53:24.801 --> 53:27.003
You're looking at about
a stage four hoarder.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.439
Get over it. Stage four
hoarder and a junkie?

53:29.472 --> 53:31.942
God damn, he hit
the proverbial jackpot.

53:31.975 --> 53:33.643
God...

53:35.512 --> 53:37.681
Hey, look what
you made me do to my cat,

53:37.714 --> 53:40.517
you made me kill
my fucking cat, you asshole.

53:46.590 --> 53:48.692
Gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

53:48.725 --> 53:50.360
Jerry, remember a year ago

53:50.393 --> 53:51.895
when you tipped me off
to that thing?

53:51.928 --> 53:54.531
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
the fruits of our labor

53:54.564 --> 53:56.833
so to speak.
Yeah, right.

53:56.866 --> 53:59.603
Well, see Jerry,
we were wondering...

53:59.636 --> 54:01.871
we were wondering
if anybody else knows

54:01.905 --> 54:03.773
about this shit?
Oh, heavens, no.

54:03.807 --> 54:05.508
You didn't tell anybody?
No.

54:05.542 --> 54:07.077
Nobody knew about this shit? No.

54:07.110 --> 54:09.446
You told nobody?
No!

54:09.479 --> 54:13.416
But it's funny
that you should mention it,

54:13.450 --> 54:16.353
because there was a guy
who came by here recently

54:16.386 --> 54:18.888
and he was asking
all sorts of questions

54:18.922 --> 54:20.557
about you two.

54:23.693 --> 54:26.396
What kind of questions?
I don't remember.

54:26.429 --> 54:28.898
I know he was just
really interested in you.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.834
Well, you didn't think
that we would want to know

54:30.867 --> 54:32.669
about that shit, Jerry?

54:32.702 --> 54:34.971
Do you know how much crack
I've smoked since then?

54:35.005 --> 54:37.540
I'm sorry.

54:37.574 --> 54:39.576
My mind's a little bit fuzzy.

54:39.609 --> 54:42.746
Jerry...
god damn, boy.

54:42.779 --> 54:46.783
God damn.
Damn it!

54:46.816 --> 54:48.885
I hope you don't think
that I'm cleaning that up?

54:48.918 --> 54:50.487
Oh, well,

54:50.520 --> 54:53.490
the thought hadn't
really crossed my mind.

54:53.523 --> 54:54.758
Jerry.
What?

54:54.791 --> 54:56.326
Jerry, listen.

54:58.128 --> 55:00.130
Is there anything
that you can tell us

55:00.163 --> 55:01.698
about this guy?

55:01.731 --> 55:04.067
Anything at all?
Hmm...

55:04.100 --> 55:05.802
yes, yes.

55:05.835 --> 55:08.571
I think I might know
where he's at.

55:08.605 --> 55:10.874
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55:15.045 --> 55:16.880
Do you have a pen?
Do you have...

55:16.913 --> 55:18.648
A pen!
Do you have a pen?

55:18.682 --> 55:20.450
Right here.
Yeah, here you go.

55:20.483 --> 55:21.851
Thanks. Yeah.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.126
Okay.

55:36.132 --> 55:37.600
Ah.

55:37.634 --> 55:39.469
Hey.

55:41.604 --> 55:43.907
Don't touch my stuff.

55:46.910 --> 55:47.911
There.

55:54.584 --> 55:57.787
Jerry, this is a strip club.

55:57.821 --> 56:00.490
Yeah. Right.
'cause that's where I saw him.

56:00.523 --> 56:03.026
No, no, no.

56:03.059 --> 56:04.761
Maybe that was another guy.

56:04.794 --> 56:05.862
Um...

56:10.967 --> 56:12.702
yes. Yes. Yes.

56:12.736 --> 56:14.604
Because he said that that's...

56:14.637 --> 56:18.007
Because he said that he had the
spot right next door to it.

56:18.041 --> 56:19.776
How do you know this shit?

56:19.809 --> 56:22.112
We got high together
a few times.

56:22.145 --> 56:24.948
Jerry...

56:24.981 --> 56:26.783
what the guy look like?

56:26.816 --> 56:28.585
Mm, I'm not really...

56:28.618 --> 56:31.955
I'm not really good
with faces these days.

56:31.988 --> 56:34.491
God damn.

56:34.524 --> 56:36.826
Can we please
get the fuck out of here now?

56:36.860 --> 56:38.862
Please.
Can we please go now?

56:38.895 --> 56:41.030
We get the fuck out of here.

56:41.064 --> 56:43.466
Come on, let's go.
What's the matter with you?

56:43.500 --> 56:45.602
You asked this motherfucker
to tell us

56:45.635 --> 56:46.870
everything that he knows.

56:46.903 --> 56:49.038
He did.
He don't know jack shit.

56:49.072 --> 56:51.107
So let's get
the fuck out, all right?

56:51.141 --> 56:52.976
Unless you wanna stop

56:53.009 --> 56:55.011
for some penicillin
on the way home,

56:55.044 --> 56:58.047
I suggest that we step off
right about now, man.

56:58.081 --> 56:59.682
Look at this.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.017
All right, let's do this,
right now.

57:01.050 --> 57:02.018
Let's step off.
Let's go.

57:02.051 --> 57:03.586
Jerry,

57:03.620 --> 57:05.722
if you see the guy again
what are you gonna do?

57:05.755 --> 57:07.590
I'm gonna put you on speed dial.

57:07.624 --> 57:09.225
Speed dial.

57:09.259 --> 57:10.226
Promise.

57:11.528 --> 57:13.763
Hey, no. No.

57:13.797 --> 57:15.765
Keep the pen.
Keep the fucking pen.

57:15.799 --> 57:17.700
Put it
in your fucking collection.

57:17.734 --> 57:20.603
Keep it fucking down over there.

57:20.637 --> 57:21.971
Son of a bitch!

57:22.005 --> 57:25.875
Hey, lose some weight!
Lose some weight!

57:25.909 --> 57:27.644
Lose some weight!

57:27.677 --> 57:29.879
That's five,
six, is that the one?

57:29.913 --> 57:32.081
Six? Number six?

57:32.115 --> 57:34.250
The fucking guy
at the titty bar said six.

57:34.284 --> 57:35.652
You hear him as well as I did.

57:35.685 --> 57:37.987
No need to get snappy.

57:39.956 --> 57:42.025
Go this... god...

57:46.729 --> 57:48.198
Okay.

57:50.700 --> 57:52.535
Okay.

58:04.280 --> 58:07.617
Berg.
Yeah?

58:07.650 --> 58:10.220
Berg, come take a look at this.

58:10.253 --> 58:12.622
Well, what's happening, man?

58:36.880 --> 58:38.147
It's him! It's him!
What?

58:47.056 --> 58:48.591
Hey!

59:04.007 --> 59:07.710
What ya doing,
Mr. Photographer?

59:11.347 --> 59:13.850
What were you doing there, berg?

59:13.883 --> 59:15.184
I told you we were following up

59:15.218 --> 59:16.753
on some leads.

59:16.786 --> 59:18.321
For what, that old woman?

59:18.354 --> 59:20.390
You were supposed to have had
that wrapped up already.

59:20.423 --> 59:21.991
Okay, we did,
but we're just, you know,

59:22.025 --> 59:24.127
trying to tie up
some loose ends,

59:24.160 --> 59:26.229
trying to make sure
that we're thorough on this.

59:26.262 --> 59:27.630
Oh, yeah?

59:27.664 --> 59:29.165
Well, while you were
being thorough,

59:29.198 --> 59:32.001
I had la breathing down my ass
all day.

59:32.035 --> 59:33.236
Because I told them that my guys

59:33.269 --> 59:35.171
would cooperate.

59:35.204 --> 59:37.874
But the two of you are making
me look like a fucking fool.

59:37.907 --> 59:40.043
Your interviews were over
three hours ago.

59:40.076 --> 59:43.780
With all due respect, commander,

59:43.813 --> 59:44.847
fuck that.

59:44.881 --> 59:47.917
No, no.
Fuck you, my friend.

59:47.951 --> 59:49.152
Now you and your sidekick

59:49.185 --> 59:51.387
are gonna march yourself
down that hall

59:51.421 --> 59:53.323
and you're gonna tell
that bitch from la

59:53.356 --> 59:55.158
everything she asks for.

59:55.191 --> 59:57.427
And if you don't, I swear to god

59:57.460 --> 59:59.395
both of you will be
checking parking meters

59:59.429 --> 01:00:02.131
downtown by lunch.

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:05.868
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, commander.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:08.171
Yes, sir.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.041
Carry on.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.977
Detective, can you
state your name

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.712
for the record?

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:19.382
Oh.
Go ahead.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:23.119
Detective Benjamin Jackson,
LAPD.

01:00:23.152 --> 01:00:25.288
So, detective,
do you know of any malfeasance

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.457
in your department?

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.760
Not to my knowledge.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.396
Okay, so, why don't you tell me

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:37.033
why you became a police officer?

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.468
I guess
the standard answer would be

01:00:38.501 --> 01:00:41.070
I wanted to help people.

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:43.439
But that's not your answer?

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:44.807
Well, we all like to help people

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.142
but anyone who tells you

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.744
that's the sole reason
they do this job

01:00:47.777 --> 01:00:49.345
is lying to you.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:52.215
Well, what's
the real reason then?

01:00:52.248 --> 01:00:54.017
I don't know,
you gotta ask them that.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:56.019
Come on, detective,
you can't tell me

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:58.755
that you think cops
operating with impunity

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.056
is good for anyone.

01:01:00.089 --> 01:01:02.025
Listen, lady,

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:04.861
lot of bad people out there.

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:08.064
And every day,

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:12.001
we're up to our waists in shit.

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.436
You think you could do
a better job?

01:01:13.469 --> 01:01:16.873
No one's questioning
the need for police.

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:19.142
Being a cop's a shitty job.

01:01:19.175 --> 01:01:22.045
Does the good you do
outweigh the bad?

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:24.247
It says here that you are
a family man.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:31.954
Any kids?
No, Ma'am.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:34.924
Is everything all right
with your plumbing?

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.793
My plumbing's fine,

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.494
not that it's any of your business.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.962
We haven't gotten
around to it yet.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:41.197
I mean, you're more than welcome

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:43.766
to come over...
Do you want kids?

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.234
What does it matter?

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.470
It matters what kind of world
they grow up in.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:53.843
How'd you land this gig anyway?

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.279
I have double degrees
in psychology and sociology.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:59.248
With a concentration on
criminal behavior and ethics.

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:01.250
That's how.

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.518
So, you're the one
who determines

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.220
what's right or wrong.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:07.457
Yeah, that's why
they pay me the big bucks.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.426
You know what?
What?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.028
It's because of people like you

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:14.230
that this country's
going to shit.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:16.432
Oh, no, no, please.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:17.900
I'm sorry, enlighten me.

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.535
Come in here in your pantsuit,

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:22.805
put your nose up in the air...

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:26.209
telling us what to do,
what not to do.

01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:27.844
And you talk and you talk

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:30.046
and you bitch and you bitch

01:02:30.079 --> 01:02:32.215
but you have no solution.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.916
But I'll tell you what I know,

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.918
crime or no crime, dirty or not,

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.888
I'll take any one
of those men out there

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.224
over a thousand
of your fancy degrees any day.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.326
And what people like you
don't understand,

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.128
is just because you get
your hands dirty,

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.563
that doesn't
always make you dirty.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:50.199
Wow.

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:54.904
I expected more from you.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.339
I mean, if you're gonna sit here

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:58.307
and hide behind a bunch
of meaningless platitudes,

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:00.109
we're gonna be here forever.

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:02.879
It's almost like you think
we're the bad guys.

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:06.415
Cops can be bad just like anybody else.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.050
What's so funny, detective?

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:10.219
So, you wanna create
these categories,

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:12.455
this is bad, that's bad.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:15.391
But the truth is,
good people do bad things

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.626
and vice versa.

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.194
But it doesn't really matter,

01:03:18.227 --> 01:03:20.930
because it all winds up
the same out there.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.132
Now, you're gonna have
to excuse me

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.902
if I don't rush
to convict my brothers,

01:03:25.935 --> 01:03:28.504
because some ivy league skirt,

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.473
who never did a day in the shit,

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.542
thinks that she can
run this thing

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.911
just because she has read a text

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.180
that tells her
that power corrupts.

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:39.348
And you don't think
power corrupts?

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:42.118
Well, you can't corrupt
something that already is.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:44.387
Look, you've been at this
station longer than me,

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.988
I'll give you that.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.191
But let me tell you
what I've learned.

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:50.493
No one is above the law.

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.962
And those who think they are

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.231
eventually they get theirs.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.200
Well, guess we'll have to wait

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.467
and see, won't we?
You know what,

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.436
clearly this is going nowhere.

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.305
So, I'm gonna ask you
one last time detective,

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.407
do you know
of any illegal activity

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.209
in this department?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.615
No.
Great.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:20.590
How'd it go? How the fuck
you think it went, man?

01:04:20.623 --> 01:04:23.226
Huh.
They're just fishing.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.194
They got dick on us.
Woman knows that.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:28.664
Right, so what
are we gonna do now?

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:30.666
Let's go to that apartment.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.468
Might be missing something.

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.403
Man, fuck that place.
He's not gonna go back there.

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.339
You got a better idea?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.707
Huh, Einstein?

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.141
I'd rather go to Jerry's house.

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:41.010
Hello, detectives.
Asshole.

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.948
No fucking way.
You're dead.

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.183
Not quite.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.484
Although I could use
a tan I guess.

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:50.453
Yeah, get on the ground.
Okay, okay.

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:53.022
Wow.
I'm not resisting.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:59.095
Keep it calm.
Go smooth.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.463
Go smooth.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.968
Easy. Okay.

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:09.105
Go to piece on him.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.341
You're fucking dead.

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.310
You know, you're really
gonna have to get past that

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:18.180
if we're gonna move
on from here.

01:05:18.214 --> 01:05:19.181
Really?

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.352
You're gonna blow my brains out?

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:26.422
In front
of a police station no less?

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:31.060
No. No.
I don't think so.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.195
Just take a breath,

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:37.566
and let's be civilized a moment.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.536
There is so much
that we need to discuss.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:48.277
How 'bout we go
for a drive, gentlemen?

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.112
Where the fuck are we going?

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:54.317
Gonna get your money, duh.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:00.256
He really isn't
the quickest one, is he?

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:02.391
East on Ventura,
driver if you will.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.194
What do you think?

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:08.164
If I smell anything
bad back there,

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.066
I'm gonna bury you
in the desert.

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:12.301
And I'm not
gonna kill you first.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:14.170
Oh, fuck.
I like that idea.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:22.278
This is bullshit, man.
Where the fuck are we going?

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.580
20th and Alameda.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.516
Then why the fuck
didn't we take the freeway?

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.152
Cause then we wouldn't
have all this time to talk.

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:32.054
Hey asshole,
nobody here's trying

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:33.189
to fucking talk to you.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.257
You're pathetic.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:39.562
I'm pathetic? You are pathetic.
You fucking moron.

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:41.797
Have you looked at yourself?

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:44.500
You're a fucking junkie.

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:47.303
You had a family,
you had a life.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.105
Now you're a junkie fuck.

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:50.606
What happened
to that wife of yours?

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:52.375
Is she coming around?

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:53.776
She split.

01:06:56.545 --> 01:07:00.249
Took my son when I went away.

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.118
Hey, that sucks.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:05.855
Hey, what happened?

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:09.291
I thought you wanted to talk.

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:13.696
Are you guys not even
the least bit curious

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.798
how I got here

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.134
in the back of this car,

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:20.736
not buried somewhere
six feet under

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.705
burned to a crisp?

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.609
How'd you do it?

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.644
One of the guards took
a liking to me.

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.679
You really didn't
think that was the end of it

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.515
did you?

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:36.185
So, I made
an arrangement with him.

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:39.755
In exchange for protection
and a few extra privileges.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.357
Let's just say
he took his arrangement

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:43.192
a little too far.

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.494
I've got a long afternoon
planned for us.

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:54.804
I'm home, Lucy.

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.140
Don't worry, sweetie.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.375
In that moment,

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:00.643
something came over me.

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:03.646
This is not gonna take
nearly as long

01:08:03.679 --> 01:08:05.414
as the last time.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.583
You can only push a man so far.

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:25.334
Fucking die.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.356
There would have been
dental records.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.924
There would have been
blood type.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.460
There would have been
an autopsy.

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.629
How come nobody caught on?

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:56.732
As far as the dental records,

01:08:56.765 --> 01:09:01.470
the funny thing about them is

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:03.839
they only really work

01:09:03.872 --> 01:09:07.343
when the teeth and the jaw
are at least partially intact.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.991
It was a necessary evil.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.960
But you guys know
all about those, right?

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:26.929
Blood type.
As far as that one.

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.930
Turns out the late guard and I

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.433
seem to have
the same blood type.

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:33.502
I guess I got lucky
with that one.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:09:59.595
Once the fire started

01:09:59.628 --> 01:10:02.698
it wasn't that hard for me
to slip away unnoticed.

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:07.403
So, you burned your cellmate...

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:09.872
you mean my cellmate
who drunkenly murdered

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.274
his four-year-old goddaughter?

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.476
That one?

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.512
Yeah.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:20.449
What? Don't be like that,
you guys.

01:10:20.482 --> 01:10:21.917
I'd like to think
that you would have done

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:26.822
the same thing
under the same circumstances.

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:29.592
Where to?

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.661
Take a right.
Right here.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.298
So, you just disappeared?

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.633
Not that hard of a thing
to accomplish

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.435
if you try.

01:10:39.468 --> 01:10:41.937
Why are you sticking
your head up now?

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:46.575
Detective, I can't tell you
how much I hate spoilers.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.310
Hey, berg,
this is fucking bullshit, man.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.578
It's a trap.

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:53.749
Come on, man.
You got a better idea?

01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:56.385
Yeah.
That's the spirit.

01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.698
Come on, let's get this money

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:10.766
and get the fuck out of here.

01:11:10.799 --> 01:11:12.401
What? I guess

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.902
we're not gonna get
the families together

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.838
for a little BBQ?

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.707
Oh, come on, berg.
What do ya say?

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:20.709
You got someone special
in your life these days?

01:11:20.743 --> 01:11:21.977
Open up the fucking gate.

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:28.717
Welcome to my humble abode.

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.052
Where's the fucking money?

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:31.787
Where's the money?
Where is it?

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.589
Where is...
You're so pushy.

01:11:33.622 --> 01:11:34.690
God, relax.

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.825
Where is it?
Okay.

01:11:36.859 --> 01:11:38.327
Easy.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.797
Is he always this impatient?

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.966
You know what?

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:47.870
You need to tell me
where the god damn money is.

01:11:47.903 --> 01:11:50.105
Where is it?
Okay.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:53.909
It's over there.
In that cabinet.

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:55.811
Don't bullshit me.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.750
Yeah, all right.
Okay, cool.

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.622
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:09.558
Yes, yes. Yes!

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:13.062
Ah, shit.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:15.531
Oh, yes.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:19.501
Oh, fuck.

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.670
Yes, baby.
Yes, baby.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.472
Huh, told you,
I'd bring you to it.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:26.842
Oh, my god.
It's a beautiful thing, man.

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.644
You're a beautiful dude.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:32.781
You're a man of your word.
He's wonderful.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:34.516
And you know what,
I got like a finder's fee

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.651
for you.

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:36.819
Yeah, here it is right here.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:50.899
You shot me?

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:53.736
Yes, I did, I shot you.

01:12:53.769 --> 01:12:56.905
First you frame me.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:59.808
And now you shoot me, again.

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.979
You know,

01:13:04.012 --> 01:13:05.481
I'm really starting to think

01:13:05.514 --> 01:13:07.082
that I'm the one
doing all the giving

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.451
in this relationship.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:13.489
Yeah, last time,
I'm sorry, I shot you wrong.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.057
But I got you right this time.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:18.193
Right in the liver
and you're gonna die.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.529
And I'm gonna watch you die.

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:24.733
Hey, man.
Huh?

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.836
Go and put that shit in the car.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.672
All right.

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:33.742
What the fuck is so funny?

01:13:33.776 --> 01:13:37.913
It's just, it's just you two.

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.815
It really doesn't take long
to see

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:42.818
who wears the pants
in this relationship.

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:45.754
Oh. Well, you enjoy
fucking death,

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.189
we don't have time
for your bullshit.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.992
I guess you don't want
to see the DVD then.

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:51.660
What DVD?

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:58.634
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:01.503
That DVD means shit to me
when you're fucking dead.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:05.140
No. No.
Not that DVD.

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.811
What the fuck
are you talking about, man?

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.079
Uh-oh.

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:14.817
It's all fun and games
until somebody gets hurt.

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:18.287
You better start making
some fucking sense.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.257
Or what? Huh?

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.160
You're gonna kill me twice?

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.165
It's on my desk.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:37.039
Ah, man, come on.

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:39.575
Blue case. I can't believe
we're dealing with this bullshit.

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:41.076
Come on, we gotta get
the fuck outta here.

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:43.745
Yeah, right there.
Attaboy.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:44.947
Hey, hello, we gotta get

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.115
the fuck outta here.
Shut up.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.618
It's only gonna take a fucking second.
Hey, I can't believe

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:53.155
you're going along
with this bullshit.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:04.299
You were in my house.
Some detective.

01:15:07.936 --> 01:15:09.838
That's my fucking wife.

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.173
I swear to god if you hurt her,

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:13.675
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:15.677
You've been bad, haven't you?

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:19.815
Oh, yeah.
You've been a bad girl.

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:23.352
By George, I think he's got it.

01:15:23.385 --> 01:15:25.153
Oh, fuck me!

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:28.790
What? What?
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:35.597
Hey, hey, whoa.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:40.168
Whoa. Hold on.
Look at this, man.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.970
Look at a what
he's trying to do.

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:44.206
I can't, I'm too busy
watching you fuck my wife.

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:46.909
Come on, if it's
any consolation, my man,

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:48.877
I can tell you this,
she loves you.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:50.712
She still loves you.
Shut up!

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:51.980
Shut the fuck up!

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:54.216
You don't get to talk about her!

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:03.292
You wanna put down that gun?

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:06.028
If you fucking
tell me what to do

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.763
I'm gonna fucking murder you.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.165
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up, shut up!

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:11.900
Shut up, okay?

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:19.775
I fucking trusted you.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:21.977
I treated you
like fucking family.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.313
You were my friend.

01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.348
That's right, man. I'm your friend.
I'm your friend.

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:28.717
I'm your partner, man.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:31.720
I'm your straight up partner.
Come on, J, man.

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.055
Come on, put down the gun, man.

01:16:33.088 --> 01:16:34.122
Don't tell me what to do,

01:16:34.156 --> 01:16:35.390
I'll blow your head off.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.327
I swear to god, man,
I'm your friend.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.330
I'm your partner.
That's it.

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.999
That's it.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:48.303
You never had the heart
for this shit, did you?

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.707
She was always too good
for your ass.

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.722
I suppose I should
thank you, huh?

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.357
You know, 'cause
it is gonna take like, months

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.325
to get rid of this dude.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:13.128
And you saved me a whole heap
of time on this shit.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:17.366
What?

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.470
Why are you looking at me
like that, man? Come on.

01:17:21.503 --> 01:17:23.338
Why are you looking
at me like that, man?

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:27.242
You must know that this shit was
gonna end up just like this.

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.716
Here's how the shit went.

01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:35.984
You got out of prison, right?

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.453
Came after my partner
and me, right?

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.923
And we followed you
to this location, right?

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:43.892
And then you resisted.

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.896
And in the process you and
my partner got killed.

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:53.702
See, now that's a good story.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:00.942
It's too bad none of it's
the least bit true.

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:08.050
Facts, truth,
right, wrong, illusions.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:10.519
Think what you want

01:18:10.552 --> 01:18:13.955
but in this life
all the road signs read

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:16.825
"save yourself."

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:22.297
but the facts
are decided by the winners.

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:27.469
And as always,
perception is key.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.208
What's so god damn funny?

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.181
You got it all
figured out, don't you?

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.955
Yeah, at this point.

01:18:46.988 --> 01:18:48.857
There's usually a lot
of hollering and screaming

01:18:48.890 --> 01:18:50.225
and pleading.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.794
People saying,
"oh, no. Don't.

01:18:52.828 --> 01:18:55.230
Please, don't.
Don't, please."

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:57.833
but you're cool.

01:18:57.866 --> 01:19:01.203
You're not into
that pathetic shit, huh?

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:03.839
No, it's like,

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.407
you're satisfied.

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:12.247
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.249
Hmm.

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.487
Say good-bye, motherfucker.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.889
Say, good-bye.
Berg, drop your weapons.

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:23.291
Drop 'em!
Turn around!

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:28.296
Put your hands
in the fucking air.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:34.136
Captain Scott...

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:35.504
you're not gonna believe this,

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.306
but we got the junkie,
the guy with the heroin,

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.075
and he brought us over here

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:42.511
and then he stabbed Jackson.

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:45.213
It was horrible.
I couldn't do a thing.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:46.815
I'm...

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.519
Arrest detective berg.

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:57.025
What are you doing?

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.227
Someone sent
the ip address to everyone.

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.630
The whole thing was broadcast
to the entire station.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:04.199
So, shut the fuck up.

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.568
Process the paperwork
on this one fast.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.103
I'm sure
there's a lot of inmates

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:10.605
who can't wait
to see your ass again.

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.843
Hey! Oh, shit!

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:27.489
<i>âª Ride âª</i>

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:30.859
<i>âª I used to jump my horse
and ride âª</i>

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:36.364
<i>âª I had a six gun at my side...
At ease. âª</i>

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.101
As we stand here today,
I'm reminded

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.937
of the many reasons

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.506
why I took up the lifelong oath

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.975
of law and order.

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:49.945
Now, I was a young man
when I took up that cause.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:51.947
The cause of justice.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.483
But not a day goes by that I
don't remember my commencement.

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:57.519
The same ones
that got me through

01:20:57.552 --> 01:20:59.554
the coldest of nights.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.356
Now is the time

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:04.326
for good people to do
the right thing.

01:21:04.359 --> 01:21:07.529
To behave in a manner
in which always reflects

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.164
the true nature of the goodness

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.599
that is in all of us.

01:21:10.632 --> 01:21:13.168
If we allow it.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:16.171
Now, you're not alone
in this fight.

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:19.374
You are the men and women
who took up this cause.

01:21:21.676 --> 01:21:24.980
And this brave choice
will be with you

01:21:25.013 --> 01:21:29.417
all the days that you work
these streets.

01:21:29.451 --> 01:21:31.586
And in the end,

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.656
I want you to know,

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:38.627
how truly honored I am
that my city

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.231
will be
in your very capable hands.

01:21:43.265 --> 01:21:44.599
But remember...

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:49.004
You now have
the power to change things.

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:53.408
Fresh meat! Yeah!
Please use this power justly.

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:58.046
As the rest of us
will be counting on you.

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:04.419
Congratulations.
And good luck.

01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:12.260
<i>âª A cowboy's work
is never done âª</i>

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.086
yes?

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.121
It's been almost six months
since you closed the books

01:22:40.155 --> 01:22:41.456
on these corruption inquiries,

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:43.091
I mean, how much progress
has been made,

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:44.726
if any at all?

01:22:44.759 --> 01:22:47.062
I think we made great strides
in curtailing this problem.

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:49.731
Revamping how the public
sees this department

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.433
and its officers.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.268
Commander, what about
the charges -yes?

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:55.470
Ranging from robbery to murder?

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:57.539
Honestly, I'm not here
to talk about that.

01:22:57.572 --> 01:23:01.076
These isolated incidents
of rogue police officers

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:03.611
has been well documented.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.680
But I can tell you
something here and now.

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.515
These are not
accurate representations

01:23:07.549 --> 01:23:08.783
