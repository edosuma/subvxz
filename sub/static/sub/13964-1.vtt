00:01.502 --> 00:03.002
Who are you?!

00:03.003 --> 00:04.503
[ONE] We all woke up just
like you: no memories,

00:04.504 --> 00:06.004
no idea who we are
or how we got here.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.439
[TWO]
No one stole our memories.

00:07.441 --> 00:08.374
It was an accident.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.341
[FIVE]
No, it wasn't.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.776
[JACE]
Who are you?

00:10.778 --> 00:12.578
What the hell are
you doing with my face?

00:12.580 --> 00:14.146
[SIX]
That's the program you wrote

00:14.148 --> 00:15.614
that wiped all our memories.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.982
Then why?

00:16.983 --> 00:18.349
Think you were trying
to protect someone.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.485
[rumbling]

00:19.487 --> 00:20.652
We've just been docked.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.254
[FIVE screams]

00:36.771 --> 00:39.038
What is this place?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.040
No idea.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.775
What happened to us?

00:42.777 --> 00:45.244
I dunno.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.513
Last thing I remember
was being on our ship.

Stand by for decontamination.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.646
Are you okay?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.614
My head is pounding.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.917
Mine, too...

03:04.919 --> 03:06.318
[FIVE] Where are we?
Wh-What happened?

03:06.320 --> 03:08.520
I don't know.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.454
We were on the ship.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.956
I... I remember that.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.759
We... I mean, we were all...

03:15.563 --> 03:18.597
We were pointing
guns at each other.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.199
Right.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.268
Someone sold us out.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.403
I-I thought it was Three.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.271
You... you thought it was Two.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.506
Three thought it was you.

[ONE]
Six!

03:34.782 --> 03:37.449
What the hell?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.818
My real name is
Lieutenant Kal Varrick,

03:39.820 --> 03:42.487
Galactic Authority,
Special Investigations Unit.

03:44.225 --> 03:44.990
Oh my God...

03:44.992 --> 03:46.592
What?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.596
It was you.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.334
[ONE]
What is this place?

03:55.336 --> 03:59.538
Hyperion-8: Galactic Maximum
Security Detention Facility.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.240
You're in the staff wing.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.475
Where are the others?

04:40.848 --> 04:43.682
[GUARD A]
You know...

04:43.684 --> 04:46.285
Girl like you in
a place like this?

04:46.287 --> 04:47.719
You'll do okay...

04:47.721 --> 04:49.588
...if you're nice
to the right people.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.493
I don't get it.
Th-Th-This doesn't make sense!

04:54.495 --> 04:58.530
I was a GA undercover agent
tasked with bringing you all in.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.565
[FIVE] So you were
lying to us this whole time?

05:00.567 --> 05:03.568
[SIX] No, I had no idea until
I went after The General.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.538
I was approached by what
I thought was one of his men,

05:06.540 --> 05:10.409
who told me he was an undercover
agent and that I was, too.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.578
Apparently, I infiltrated
The General's organization,

05:13.580 --> 05:16.014
but after The General
blew up Hyadum-12,

05:16.016 --> 05:17.516
I lost it.

05:17.518 --> 05:21.086
[gunshots]

05:24.925 --> 05:28.593
The GA pulled me out
and put me on medical leave.

05:28.595 --> 05:33.665
But eventually, they...
gave me a new assignment.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.067
The "Raza."

05:36.870 --> 05:39.638
[SIX] Of course, I didn't
believe them at first,

05:39.640 --> 05:40.906
but he said he'd send me proof.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.040
Just shut up.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.810
[SIX]
When I got back to the ship,

05:44.811 --> 05:47.579
I logged on, and there it was:
my personnel file, my real name.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.513
[FIVE sighs]

05:48.515 --> 05:49.915
It was all true.

05:53.420 --> 05:55.020
I was torn. I didn't
know what to do.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.422
[FIVE]
Just-Just stop talking.

05:57.424 --> 06:00.759
[SIX] I was a cop,
sworn to uphold the law.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.060
And after that planet
was destroyed--

06:02.062 --> 06:03.628
Shut up!

06:06.033 --> 06:08.934
We trusted you.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.902
We were your friends.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.674
The two of you still are.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.977
[SIX]
I'm sorry...

06:18.979 --> 06:20.579
I mean, I don't
regret what I did.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.614
It had to be done.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.017
I just... wish you
didn't have to get hurt.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.753
Well, it's too late.

06:29.957 --> 06:33.158
[SIX]
Hey, look, we ran your DNA.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.960
We found your real identities.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.828
I already know.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.566
My name's Derrick Moss.

06:41.568 --> 06:45.003
I ran a DNA scan after
we used transfer transit.

06:46.673 --> 06:47.773
What about you?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.107
You wanna know your real name?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.543
What I wanna know is
what's gonna happen to us--

06:51.545 --> 06:53.078
All of us.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.881
Well, the GA's still
trying to figure out

06:55.883 --> 06:58.950
what to do with you two.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.086
But the others will have
to stay in general population

07:01.088 --> 07:03.488
until we can
arrange their trial.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.791
Do they know what Two is?
Did you tell them?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.393
No.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.994
And as long as she
keeps her nose clean,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.496
it shouldn't matter.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.997
You don't seriously
believe that, do you?

07:11.999 --> 07:13.965
Sooner or later,
they're gonna find out.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.867
She has to answer
for her crimes,

07:15.869 --> 07:17.769
and so do the others.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.671
But as long as
you two cooperate,

07:19.673 --> 07:21.006
you'll be fine.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.974
You mean you want us
to testify against them.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.676
[FEMALE ATTORNEY]
Don't say another word.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.578
Who are you?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.947
Felicia Brand,
this man's attorney,

07:28.949 --> 07:31.716
and this is a court order
demanding his immediate release.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.025
[WARDEN] Congratulations,
Lieutenant Varrick.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.128
Those arrests--they're
a real feather in your cap.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.232
That's not why I did it.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.967
If you say so.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.802
[SIX] One of your
prisoners, Portia Lin--

07:50.804 --> 07:53.138
I think it might be a good idea
if you kept her in isolation,

07:53.140 --> 07:54.840
at least for a while.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.975
And why's that?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.077
She's... unstable.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.779
She could cause
you some trouble.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.113
[WARDEN] Well, that's
an accurate description

08:02.115 --> 08:04.049
of just about
everyone in the place,

08:04.051 --> 08:05.750
including some of the guards.

08:05.752 --> 08:06.952
So what?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.787
Is there something
I should know?

08:09.790 --> 08:13.725
Well, you have
my recommendation.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.160
[WARDEN]
Duly noted.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.594
Oh, and thank you so much
for trying to tell me

08:16.597 --> 08:17.863
how to do my job.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.031
It's greatly appreciated.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.192
[FELICIA]
Sorry about this place.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.093
It was the best we could
find on short notice.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.098
It-It seems pretty okay to me.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.699
Oh.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.603
Look, about that girl--

08:58.605 --> 09:00.539
I don't know her real name,
but we called her "Five."

09:00.541 --> 09:03.342
[FELICIA]
I'm sorry, as your lawyer,

09:03.343 --> 09:06.144
I need to advise you to distance
yourself from those people.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.113
Those people are my friends.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.614
They're criminals.

09:09.616 --> 09:10.749
You need to stop
worrying about them

09:10.751 --> 09:13.151
and start thinking
about your future.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.186
Now, I found a decent
plastic surgeon.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.689
He can put you back
to the way you were

09:17.691 --> 09:18.924
before you go in
front of the board.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.660
It... It might help.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.065
This is the only
face I remember.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.103
There's something else. Um...

09:33.040 --> 09:35.807
I wanna see the police
files on my wife's murder.

[INMATE A] Well, look
who it is: Marcus Boone.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.995
It's been a while.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.730
Should I know you guys?

09:58.732 --> 10:01.600
Right, the amnesia thing.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.968
Another con.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.138
Not this time.

10:06.139 --> 10:09.307
You may not remember us,
but we definitely remember you.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.145
[THREE] Fellas, I am not looking
for any trouble, all right?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.780
You shoulda thought
of that when you screwed us

10:15.782 --> 10:17.882
out of our cut of that
bank job on Vellis Nine.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.651
Gimme a break; anyone
could just waltz in here

10:19.653 --> 10:21.686
and say that I owe them
money. That's ridiculous.

10:21.688 --> 10:22.854
Ugh!

10:22.856 --> 10:25.824
[INMATE A]
You do owe us a lot of money.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.158
But we'll start
with something small,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.761
like, say, your ration card.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.730
Wait... Don't I
need that to eat...?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.231
[INMATE A]
Your problem.

10:33.233 --> 10:33.999

10:34.001 --> 10:35.700

A-hem.

10:35.702 --> 10:37.102
Stay out of this, Nyx.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.670
I'm sorry, boys.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.237
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to move on.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.840
Yeah.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.746
[coughs, gasps]

10:48.649 --> 10:50.181
[INMATE A]
This isn't over.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.671
[THREE]
Impressive.

10:56.672 --> 10:57.988
I guess I should thank you, huh?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.258
No, but you can pay me.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.192
Pay you?

11:01.194 --> 11:02.727
I'll take your ration card.

11:02.729 --> 11:05.030
That's what they
were asking for.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.865
I could've just
given it to them.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.900
Well, now you can
just give it to me.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.202
[THREE]
Uh! Whoa!

11:11.204 --> 11:12.804

11:14.441 --> 11:16.141

11:39.466 --> 11:40.865
You're pretty good.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.934
Likewise. Wanna call it a draw?

11:42.936 --> 11:44.335
No chance.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.874
Okay, okay, I'll come quietly.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.876
There's no need
to use that thing on me.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.278
You kidding?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.317
It's the highlight of my day.

12:05.292 --> 12:10.328
[GA TECH] All right, ship's
android, model 6641619-8.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.931
[THE ANDROID]
That's me.

12:12.933 --> 12:15.300
You have a record of
your sensory inputs, yes?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.435
Everything you say and do,
everything you see and hear?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.436
Of course.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.322
How far back?

12:20.323 --> 12:22.207
From the moment I was
reactivated in the infirmary:

12:22.209 --> 12:25.944
47 days, 8 hours,
and 14 minutes.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.813
Although... there are some gaps.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.181
[GA TECH] Yeah, we'll
worry about that later.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.850
Right now, I need
you to link to my server

12:31.852 --> 12:33.418
--and upload your files.
--I can't.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.386
Uh, why not?

12:35.388 --> 12:36.821
I mean, I know you're
an older model--

12:36.823 --> 12:38.923
Let me rephrase:

12:38.925 --> 12:40.492
I won't.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.260
[scoffs] Excuse me?

12:42.262 --> 12:44.162
I said I won't.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.165
You've been impounded,
just like the ship.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.034
You're GA property now,
so you will cooperate.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.470
No. I won't.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.872
[sighs]

12:53.873 --> 12:55.273
Obsolete tech is the worst.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.442
First, the base
programming breaks down,

12:57.444 --> 13:00.245
then, eventually the entire
system is corrupt.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.147
Okay, fine, fine.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.132
We'll do it the hard way.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.116
I'll upload a recovery program
and extract the files myself.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.253
If you do that, you'll
trigger a security protocol

13:08.255 --> 13:10.855
that will scramble
my entire neural network.

13:10.857 --> 13:13.491
I'll become inoperable
and require a full reboot.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
All data will be lost.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.163
Including your
personality matrix.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.933
True... regrettably.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.652
[GA TECH]
I got orders, okay?

13:23.653 --> 13:25.370
If I don't get these files,
it's my head on a platter.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.006
That seems unlikely.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.407
But okay.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.152
Better?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.554
Yeah.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.326
Better.

13:55.836 --> 13:56.935
You figured it out?

13:56.937 --> 13:58.336
[THREE]
Hmm?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.440
Are you talking to me?

14:02.442 --> 14:04.609
Not so bad in here, is it?

14:04.611 --> 14:07.846
Better food, better view...

14:09.616 --> 14:11.082
[THREE]
Yeah.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.284
The catch is,
you gotta get hurt.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.053
That's the trick.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.921
What are you talkin' about?

14:16.923 --> 14:18.923
Got to know the right
kind of injuries--

14:18.925 --> 14:22.360
the ones that give you
maximum time for minimum pain.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.564
Radiation burn:
not life threatening,

14:26.566 --> 14:28.499
but requires a lot of therapy.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.134
Bought me five days.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.438
Wait, you're telling me
you did that to yourself?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.039
That's crazy, man.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.646
Is it?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.416
[THREE]
Who's the guy?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.951
That's Devon.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.019
He a prisoner?

14:48.021 --> 14:49.838
[OLD INMATE]
Oh, yeah.

14:49.839 --> 14:51.656
But he's got medical training,
so they let him do his

[TWO gasps]

15:09.376 --> 15:11.476
You held your own against Nyx.

[GUARD A]
Solitary.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.681

She was attacking my friend.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.219

Yeah, she does that.

Well, that depends.

to learn a lesson?

Is that really you?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.507
Um, who are you?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.509
Oh, of course.
You wouldn't know.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.013
My name is Darius. I'm acting
Chief Executive Officer

16:22.015 --> 16:24.148
of Corelactic Industries.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.483
My father's company.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.218
Your company now.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.386
May I?

16:28.388 --> 16:30.188
I came as soon as I could.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.190
My personal transport
is in orbit,

16:32.192 --> 16:34.092
waiting to take you home.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.361
There's some GA red tape
to deal with first,

16:36.363 --> 16:39.297
but it's nothing that
Felicia can't handle.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.732
So you're the one who sent her.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.167
Of course.

16:43.169 --> 16:46.504
I know you don't remember this,
but I worked with your father

16:46.506 --> 16:48.272
for 30 years.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
I watched you grow up.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.244
And when he told me that
he was leaving you the company,

16:53.246 --> 16:55.780
I swore that I'd do everything
in my power to help you.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.016
If there's anything you need...

16:58.018 --> 16:59.751
Yeah, actually,
there is something.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.255
I've been doing some research,
going over the police files

17:04.257 --> 17:05.423
on my wife's murder.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.025
[DARIUS]
Ah, a real tragedy.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.793
She was a beautiful woman.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.029
[ONE] Yeah, but the thing is,
the only evidence they have

17:11.031 --> 17:12.697
against Marcus Boone
is the testimony

17:12.699 --> 17:15.666
of the security guard,
the one who supposedly

17:15.668 --> 17:17.568
gave him the access
code to the building.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.337
A former employee.

17:19.339 --> 17:22.106
Always a bitter pill when you're
betrayed by one of your own.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.641
Yeah, except that Boone's
record is full of stuff

17:23.643 --> 17:26.044
like mercenary work,
hijacking, weapons shipments,

17:26.046 --> 17:28.079
taking down corporate
freighters--

17:28.081 --> 17:30.181
Small time B&E, not so much.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.816
What are you getting at?

17:31.818 --> 17:33.418
Maybe it's nothing,
but I-I'd like to talk

17:33.420 --> 17:35.553
to that security guard.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.687
[DARIUS] Derrick, I can assure
you that I was informed

17:37.690 --> 17:39.824
at every step of
the investigation,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.225
and there's no doubt
in my mind--

find him, please?

17:45.331 --> 17:47.165
Shouldn't be too hard.

17:48.701 --> 17:52.236
Are you sure you're all right?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.771
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.361
I'm curious.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.697
How exactly do they
take down a whole block?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.632
There's currently one guard
watching us right now,

18:54.634 --> 18:56.467
and he seems preoccupied.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.378
the forensic team can get here.

I know that, but
you didn't really think

19:41.814 --> 19:43.447
I would leave this
behind, did you?

19:43.449 --> 19:44.549
Anyway, I fixed it.

charging properly.

We just got word.

19:58.441 --> 19:59.963

postponed indefinitely.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.933

Everyone and their grandmother's
been filing for extradition.

Well, there may be
a little more to it than that.

Word is, Ferrous is pushing
hard for a quick trial,

It's a way for prisoners who
have shown violent tendencies

21:37.897 --> 21:41.032
to interact without any risks.

21:41.034 --> 21:44.535

I suppose I should thank you for
the... the tablet, the books.

only thing keeping me

crack it for me.

was to help you.

After a little arm-twisting,
it looks like the GA

in a bar last night.

move in polite society.

It's time for you
to put this all behind you.

The Warden's furious,
and he wants me

26:24.717 --> 26:27.585
to hand over the instigator.

26:27.587 --> 26:31.755
Now, if I did,
he'd put you in solitary

26:31.757 --> 26:33.324
for six months.

26:33.326 --> 26:36.193
Halfway through,
you'd be smearing your shit

26:36.195 --> 26:37.928
all over the walls,
and by the end,

26:37.930 --> 26:41.231
you'd be gibbering
like a lobotomized toddler.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.735
I've seen it happen.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.003
[FOUR] If you were
going to hand me over,

26:46.005 --> 26:48.038
you would've done it already.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.174
You obviously brought me
here for a reason.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.712
No, thanks.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.984
Mmm.

27:00.987 --> 27:05.656
You and your friends
are new here.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.859
You need to understand
the way things work.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.228
The warden likes
it quiet--by the book.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.731
It looks good on
his quarterly reports.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.699
So I make sure
it stays that way.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.268
And in exchange,
you get certain benefits.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.672
[ARAX] Which I can pass
along to anyone who cooperates.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.873
Everyone wins.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.009
'Specially you.

27:27.279 --> 27:31.382
Those men with the
tattoos--they a part of this?

27:31.384 --> 27:34.652
They made their own
separate arrangement.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.053
We try to stay out
of each other's way,

27:36.055 --> 27:39.156
but you may have
screwed that up, too.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.891
It was necessary
to test the response

27:40.893 --> 27:42.860
to a chaotic situation.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.328
[ARAX]
Mm.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.929
What did you think?

27:45.931 --> 27:47.698
Interesting.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.334
Sonic disabler.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.236
The guards all wear
these little earpieces

27:52.238 --> 27:54.038
that nullify the effect.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.739
If they want,
they can broadcast it

27:55.741 --> 27:58.809
through the entire prison,
taking down every single inmate

27:58.811 --> 28:01.245
in seconds. It's very effective.

28:01.247 --> 28:04.114
But not foolproof.

28:06.719 --> 28:10.354
You see, this is exactly
what I was talking about.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.022
You think you're some
hotshot mercenary

28:12.024 --> 28:14.958
that's better than
the rest of us common crooks.

28:14.960 --> 28:19.930
No one has ever
escaped from this place.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.932
If you try, you'll
just get yourself killed,

28:21.934 --> 28:26.336
and the rest of us will be
put in lockdown for a month.

28:26.338 --> 28:29.940
And you just might lose
your special arrangement.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.044
You and your friends
are going to toe the line.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.979
Or what?

28:35.981 --> 28:37.948
[ARAX]
Or you're going to regret it.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.503
[sighs]

29:14.120 --> 29:15.919
How's the food?

29:19.825 --> 29:21.225
Seriously?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.264
No time to eat anyway.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.966
You got laundry.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.100
Well, this is unexpected.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.501
Can I come in?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.911
[SIX]
Nice.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.114
[ONE] Being a wealthy
industrialist has its perks.

30:17.116 --> 30:20.450
Although, to be honest,
after a while, it starts to feel

30:20.452 --> 30:23.353
like its own kind of prison.

30:23.355 --> 30:25.589
Trust me, this is better.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.528
Uh, so just so you know,
um, Five's gonna be okay.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.497
The GA's not gonna
pursue charges.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.199
Good.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.339
Look, y-you know
I had to do it, right?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.545
Do you want a drink?

30:49.949 --> 30:51.515
Yes, please.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.387
So I hear you're going
back to your old life.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.990
That's good.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.893
Can't complain.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.094
Everything anyone
could possibly want

31:04.096 --> 31:06.630
is supposedly waiting
out there for me.

31:08.968 --> 31:12.135
Something just
doesn't feel right.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.537
What d'you mean?

31:17.109 --> 31:19.443
You read my file.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.078
You know what
happened to my wife.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.446
Yeah, looks like
Boone killed her.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.916
[ONE] Yeah, according to
the testimony of one witness.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.317
But the second I start
asking questions,

31:27.319 --> 31:29.553
that witness turns up dead.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.388
That's a mighty big coincidence.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.924
Who else knew you
were asking these questions?

31:33.926 --> 31:36.593
The CEO of my father's company.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.598
He says he's loyal.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.101
He says he's on my side,
but... if I go back,

31:44.103 --> 31:45.502
I take his place.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.309
Maybe there's something to it.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.078
Or maybe you've just spent
too much time on that ship.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.213
It's made you paranoid.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.614
No.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.451
If anything, it's woken me up.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.154
Made me realize the dangers
of being too trusting.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.963
I brought you something.

32:15.134 --> 32:18.402
When you came out of stasis,
you had no memory,

32:18.404 --> 32:20.570
but you knew the
right thing to do

32:20.572 --> 32:23.206
because you are who you are.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.981
Never forget that.

32:48.968 --> 32:49.967
[THREE]
Boom!

32:49.969 --> 32:51.368
Ha-ha!

32:56.976 --> 32:58.375
[groans]

33:09.221 --> 33:12.356
[THREE screams]

33:16.228 --> 33:17.327
You manage to crack the file?

33:17.329 --> 33:18.695
Yeah.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.364
Yeah, I did.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.066
So... what is it?

33:23.068 --> 33:24.534
You're not gonna like it.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.082
Pretty nasty burn.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.751
[THREE]
Yeah.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.419
Musta not been paying attention
to what you were doing.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.488
First time I ever operated
one of those things,

33:44.490 --> 33:47.290
so, uh... just got distracted.

33:50.596 --> 33:54.197
What happened to
the nurse from yesterday?

33:54.199 --> 33:56.366
Just transferred out.
Stress leave.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.271
What about the old guy?

34:01.273 --> 34:03.140
Supposed to be here
a couple more days.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.175
[DEVON]
Who, Charlie?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.244
Yeah, he was a frequent visitor.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.645
Turns out his wounds
were self-inflicted,

34:08.647 --> 34:10.047
so the warden had
him transferred

34:10.049 --> 34:12.316
over to the psyche wing.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.584
He'll be getting steady doses
of electric shock therapy now.

34:14.586 --> 34:15.519
Oh.

34:15.521 --> 34:16.453
[DEVON]
How's that feel?

34:16.455 --> 34:17.654
Move it around.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.058
It's all good.

34:21.060 --> 34:21.725
Send me back.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.627
You sure?

34:23.628 --> 34:25.528
Burn protocol says I keep you
here a minimum 24 hours.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.097
No, I'm fine.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.399
Sheets aren't gonna
fold themselves, huh?

34:29.401 --> 34:31.501
[DEVON]
Hey, that's a positive attitude.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.136
I'll be sure and include
that in my report.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.538
[THREE]
Okay.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.145
[NYX]
I was hoping you'd come back.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.581
It's cold, and it's miserable,
but it's a lot better

34:44.583 --> 34:46.383
than that cell.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.968
Listen.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.552
I hear you and your friends
were never sentenced.

34:49.555 --> 34:50.787
You never even got a trial.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.389
Yeah, that's right.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.193
I take it that's
not normal procedure.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.161
I've been in
the system for years,

34:58.163 --> 34:59.729
and I've never seen it before.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.765
They're scared of you.

35:01.767 --> 35:03.667
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.369
Even if we had a trial,
they would find us guilty.

35:06.371 --> 35:07.771
We are guilty.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.174
So that's it?

35:10.175 --> 35:12.576
You're just gonna give up, spend
the rest of your life here?

35:12.578 --> 35:14.778
Do I have a choice?

35:16.281 --> 35:17.714
I wonder.

35:22.154 --> 35:22.752
The hell?!

35:22.754 --> 35:23.687
Why didn't you tell me?!

35:23.689 --> 35:25.439
Tell you what?!

35:25.440 --> 35:27.190
The GA knew about the plan
to bomb Hyadum-12,

35:27.192 --> 35:28.458
and they let it happen.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.826
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.895
They let those people die
so they could turn public

35:31.897 --> 35:33.530
opinion against the rebels.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.365
Yeah, and they also
got a big injection of cash

35:35.367 --> 35:37.134
from the Corporations
to help with the fight.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.201
Why didn't you tell me?!

35:38.203 --> 35:39.603
[ANDERS]
I did tell you!

35:40.572 --> 35:42.539
Don't you get it?

35:42.541 --> 35:44.407
We've had this
conversation before.

35:44.409 --> 35:46.376
You just don't remember.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.677
When?

35:47.679 --> 35:49.779
You were on sick leave.
I came to visit you.

35:49.781 --> 35:52.382
I thought you deserved
to know, so I told you.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.251
You told me the truth?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.252
About the bomb?

35:55.253 --> 35:56.252
[ANDERS]
Yeah, you were pissed off.

35:56.255 --> 35:59.189
Hell, you nearly broke my jaw.

35:59.191 --> 36:01.458
But I-I went back to work.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.593
'Course you did,
because you realized

36:03.595 --> 36:05.462
there was no other choice.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.932
This is their game, and we
are just their soldiers.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.334
We don't push back.

36:11.336 --> 36:12.736
Like hell we don't.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.247
[GUARD B]
That's it.

36:24.249 --> 36:25.782
You're out.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.289
[GUARD B]
That was two days.

36:32.291 --> 36:34.424
Cross the line again,
and it's two weeks.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.501
Look who's back.

36:44.503 --> 36:45.702
How was solitary?

36:45.704 --> 36:47.304
--Interesting.
--[THREE] Mm-hm?

36:47.306 --> 36:48.572
What happened to your hand?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.373
It's a long story.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.908
Look at the wallflower.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.684
[THREE sighs]
Well, look at us.

37:00.686 --> 37:03.954
All together again,
just like old times.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.423
So what have we learned?

37:06.425 --> 37:07.975
About what?

37:07.976 --> 37:09.526
[TWO] About how things
work around here.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.761
Please don't tell me you've been
playing cards this entire time.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.431
I haven't been playing
cards this entire time.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.533
Just-- In fact,

37:16.535 --> 37:18.268
I thought I figured out
a way to game the system

37:18.270 --> 37:19.703
to get special privileges--

37:19.705 --> 37:22.806
You know, like time off
work detail or better food.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.407
And?

37:24.409 --> 37:26.343
Turns out, not so much.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.481
At least I tried.

37:31.483 --> 37:32.916
How 'bout you?

37:32.918 --> 37:35.785
I tested the
prison's riot protocol.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.455
[FOUR] It was necessary
to evaluate the guards'

37:38.457 --> 37:40.857
response time and technique.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.525
They use a
powerful sonic blast

37:42.527 --> 37:44.261
to disable everyone in the area.

37:44.263 --> 37:45.996
And those earpieces
the guards all wear--

37:45.998 --> 37:49.532
they filter out the frequency,
so they're unaffected.

37:49.534 --> 37:50.367
Interesting.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.801
[THREE]
Mm-hm.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.437
D'you think your
nanites would protect you

37:54.439 --> 37:56.406
from something like that?

37:56.408 --> 37:57.974
I dunno. How fast does it work?

37:57.976 --> 37:59.876
Virtually instantaneous.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.711
I dunno if they'd keep me
from feeling the effects,

38:01.713 --> 38:04.414
but they might help
me recover faster.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.882
That's good to know.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.284
Well, we've done our jobs.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.885
What 'bout you, Boss?

38:12.958 --> 38:15.692
Please tell me that you did
not make friends with her.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.294
She's mean.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.895
I think she might be useful.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.064
[THREE]
How?

38:21.066 --> 38:24.868
She didn't wanna
tell me too much, but...

38:24.870 --> 38:26.069
...I get the sense
that she might know

38:26.071 --> 38:28.438
a way out of here.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.773
Seriously?

38:29.775 --> 38:31.708
[FOUR] There's one more
thing you should know.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.444
The guards won't be the only
ones we need to worry about.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.496
The boss of one of
the prison gangs

38:36.497 --> 38:38.547
warned me against doing anything
that might cause trouble.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.683
[THREE sighs]

38:39.685 --> 38:41.685
[FOUR]
So they'll be watching us.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.037
[THREE]
Great.

38:44.038 --> 38:46.388
Just make the impossible
job a little harder.

38:46.391 --> 38:48.024
We just need to be careful
with who we speak to.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.893
[THREE]
Mm-hmm.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.831
So are we doing this thing?

38:54.833 --> 38:56.499
Hm?

38:56.501 --> 38:58.001
I mean, we're really
gonna try to escape

38:58.003 --> 39:01.705
from the inescapable prison
on a moon with no atmosphere.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.707
We're the crew of the Raza.

39:03.709 --> 39:05.075
You're damn right
we're doing it.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.366
You wanted to see me?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.802
We just got the call.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.637
It's on.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.773
Make the arrangements.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.843
Girl might be tricky if we
can't put her in Gen Pop.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.678
We're transferring
her planetside.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.080
It'll be dealt with
on the other end.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.916
She's just a kid.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.085
Here's the thing
about kids, Herv:

39:49.087 --> 39:52.655
they grow up to become adults.

39:52.657 --> 39:56.159
What about the one
who lawyered up--Moss?

39:56.161 --> 39:57.761
It's out of our hands.

39:57.763 --> 40:00.630
Somebody else's problem now.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.031
Got it.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.156
It's your lucky day, Kid.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.657
Your transfer just came through.

40:27.659 --> 40:28.858
Transfer where?

40:28.859 --> 40:30.058
[SIX] You're being
placed in a group home

40:30.061 --> 40:30.960
down on the planet.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.762
A group home?!

40:32.763 --> 40:34.563
[SIX] I know it's not ideal,
but it's just temporary.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.900
I don't wanna go.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.635
Well, that's a first one for me.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.937
I never heard a prisoner say
they wanted to stay here before.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.105
[sighs] Just--

40:42.107 --> 40:44.007
Just put me in the
general population.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.909
At least I'd be with my friends.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.977
That's no place for you.

40:48.747 --> 40:51.047
My place was on that ship.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.482
But you made sure that
that would never

40:52.484 --> 40:53.767
happen again, didn't you?

40:53.768 --> 40:55.051
[DURAND] Okay, you know
the really funny thing is?

40:55.053 --> 40:56.953
You think you
actually get a say.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.038
Come on, let's go.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.122
Y-- Let go of me!

40:59.124 --> 41:01.858
You want to get cuffed and
shackled, you keep it up.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.727
Don't.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.140
[FIVE} Why are you
letting them do this?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.575
[SIX]
I'm trying to help you.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.876
[FIVE] No, you're
trying to help yourself

41:19.878 --> 41:22.579
by sending me away to
be someone else's problem.

41:22.581 --> 41:23.813
I'm an inconvenience.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.881
You can say that again.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.016
Just get her on the shuttle.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.252
[WOMAN B] I'm afraid I have
to countermand that order.

41:29.254 --> 41:30.921
Who are you?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.589
Commander Shaddick,
chief inspector

41:32.591 --> 41:35.758
of the Galactic Authority's
Serious Crimes division.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.827
That girl's not going anywhere.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.896
[SIX] I was told she wasn't
gonna face any new charges.

41:39.898 --> 41:43.867
And she won't, if she cooperates
with my investigation.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.769
[SHADDICK]
Effective immediately,

41:46.771 --> 41:48.738
you have been
relieved of your duties.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.273
This case is mine now.

42:03.588 --> 42:04.988
I'm ready.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.996
Long time, no see.

42:12.998 --> 42:15.198
[gunshots]
