him like one of their own.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.619
Hey, Randy, it's cool
that you're famous.
I'm famous too.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.655
I won the $350 million
Mega Ball.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.691
Then I shot my dad.
That was stupid.

37:39.758 --> 37:43.729
Oh, yeah.
You were on the news.
The million dollar moron.

37:43.795 --> 37:49.735
Multi-million dollar moron.
But, yeah, that was me.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.375
So you actually know
Tim Stack?
Uh-huh.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.710
Wow. He's funny.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.413
I'd like to kidnap him
and spend some time with him.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.649
Then maybe set him on fire.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.852
Yeah. He would be funny
on fire.

38:06.918 --> 38:10.021
* Tim Stack, Tim Stack
Set him on fire *

38:10.088 --> 38:12.491
* Set him on fire
Watch him burn to death *

38:12.558 --> 38:15.361
* Tim Stack, Tim Stack
Set him on fire *

38:15.427 --> 38:17.596
* Set him on fire
Watch him burn to death *

38:17.663 --> 38:20.399
* Tim Stack, Tim Stack
Set him on fire **
