WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.349
It's the Goddamn
golden goose, kid.

00:01.413 --> 00:04.122
These guys sell
to 50 dispensaries at once.

00:04.190 --> 00:05.386
Can't cut him out of the job.

00:05.454 --> 00:06.776
- It's his job.
- This idiot wants  to run

00:06.844 --> 00:08.815
a-an armored
truck off the road with a pistol.

00:08.883 --> 00:10.296
Can we hit it
during the last pickup?

00:10.364 --> 00:12.337
No.
We have to do it here.

00:12.405 --> 00:13.996
Heard you had
a rough afternoon.

00:14.073 --> 00:16.100
You moved my cellmate,
didn't you?

00:16.177 --> 00:17.871
You replaced her
with Alvarez.

00:17.948 --> 00:18.960
You see this?

00:19.037 --> 00:20.709
Smurf, I'm the only reason
that black eye

00:20.786 --> 00:22.424
isn't an everyday
occurrence.

00:22.501 --> 00:24.111
If I stop coming,

00:24.188 --> 00:25.985
you're gonna die in here.

00:26.079 --> 00:27.453
You're good with
the jump, right?

00:27.530 --> 00:29.140
- Yeah.
- Get a truck.

00:29.217 --> 00:31.481
And we're gonna need something
with 4-wheel drive by tonight.

00:31.558 --> 00:33.563
Nothing flashy.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.117
You have
an interesting aura.

00:36.194 --> 00:38.356
It says you follow
instead of lead.

00:38.433 --> 00:41.024
Except sex.
That's your superpower.

00:41.092 --> 00:42.500
You're comfortable
in the truck?

00:42.568 --> 00:43.583
No problem.

00:43.651 --> 00:45.211
Keep your mouth shut.
Get in, get out.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.681
Text Billy when you're done,
all right?

00:46.749 --> 00:48.131
Let's do this.

00:48.517 --> 00:52.268
I think your witness testimony
is bullshit.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.656
I'll see you tomorrow...
in court.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.048
Janine Cody?

00:56.524 --> 00:58.870
Congratulations.
You're going home.

01:00.267 --> 01:01.373
Tell him
what you told me.

01:01.482 --> 01:02.875
Before I got picked up,

01:02.952 --> 01:04.325
people were talking
about a lady,

01:04.403 --> 01:06.190
paid someone to pull a hit
on her son.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.615
Shot him in his driveway.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.643
Did he say why
she wanted him dead?

01:09.759 --> 01:11.217
I heard he stole
from her.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.246
You mind popping
the back for me?

02:31.323 --> 02:32.499
Sure.

Damn. Jesus. How do you
deal with this all day?

All good.

Yo, Pope.

05:20.596 --> 05:22.106
Pope, let's go.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.712
They're up in the air.

05:34.858 --> 05:36.373
Hey, let's get
some tunes, man.

05:36.450 --> 05:38.125
- No.
- Come on.

05:38.202 --> 05:39.781
No!
Why?

05:40.153 --> 05:41.372
Because.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.151
'Cause I said.

05:46.648 --> 05:49.566
Come on, dude. This is ridiculous.
Let's get some...

05:49.643 --> 05:51.379
Ow. Hey, man! You do that again,
I'll break your Goddamn hand.

05:51.456 --> 05:52.665
- You hear me?
- That hurts!

05:52.742 --> 05:55.093
You do that again,
I'll break your Goddamn hand!

06:31.555 --> 06:34.635
We're three miles out.
It's time to move.

06:36.845 --> 06:38.248
J.

06:38.684 --> 06:39.799
Oh, shit.

06:40.272 --> 06:41.810
We got a problem.

06:42.143 --> 06:43.351
What?

06:43.428 --> 06:45.014
I don't have eyes.

06:45.091 --> 06:46.545
They stacked you
on top of me.

06:46.703 --> 06:49.522
Shit. We're gonna miss
the drop point, man.

06:57.723 --> 07:01.266
J, drop point's
in 16 minutes.

07:03.674 --> 07:06.032
All clear. Go.

07:30.634 --> 07:31.827
Put your hands up.

07:31.904 --> 07:33.331
Go.

07:33.408 --> 07:34.549
Your gun.

07:34.626 --> 07:37.971
Buckle your seat belt.
Come on, seat belt.

07:38.405 --> 07:41.252
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up.

07:44.703 --> 07:46.498
- Pilot.
- Okay.

07:48.785 --> 07:50.773
Hey, be cool, man.

07:50.953 --> 07:52.872
It's a long way down.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.632
All right. Now, you're gonna
listen to me, okay?

08:03.709 --> 08:06.817
No bullshit dives or trying to
turn the plane around. You got me?

08:06.894 --> 08:09.919
- I don't want a problem.
- Okay, good. Me neither.

08:09.996 --> 08:11.989
All right.
Now give me your phone.

08:12.081 --> 08:13.429
Come on, man.

08:13.506 --> 08:15.395
Now... Now your wallet.

08:15.854 --> 08:17.643
Come on, let's go.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.134
Great.

08:20.664 --> 08:21.862
All right.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.991
Nice to meet you, Nelson.

08:24.160 --> 08:27.193
Wouldn't want anything to happen
to that beautiful family of yours

08:27.270 --> 08:32.500
at 2345 Cypress Court,
Waco, Texas, no?

08:33.094 --> 08:36.392
Okay. Now, listen to me...
This is what you're gonna do.

08:36.582 --> 08:40.046
You're gonna bring the plane
down to 10,000 feet. You got me?

08:40.123 --> 08:42.859
Then you're just gonna continue on
to your original destination, okay?

08:42.936 --> 08:44.361
Does that sound good
to you?

08:44.438 --> 08:46.562
- Got it.
- All right, good.

09:08.075 --> 09:09.719
So, what's next?

09:11.737 --> 09:14.222
Spending time
with my family.

09:15.079 --> 09:16.781
So retirement, then.

09:17.246 --> 09:19.043
From what?

09:19.804 --> 09:21.164
I'm a mother.

09:21.241 --> 09:24.386
Mothers don't retire
till they're dead.

09:26.051 --> 09:28.674
Think the boys
will be happy to see you?

09:29.665 --> 09:31.307
I took a look at
the visitor's log,

09:31.384 --> 09:34.107
and I didn't see too much
activity when you were there...

09:34.184 --> 09:36.330
I mean, other than J,
and we both know

09:36.407 --> 09:38.638
that wasn't because
he missed you.

09:39.472 --> 09:41.658
Your boys are using
your real-estate holdings

09:41.735 --> 09:43.428
to launder their money.

09:44.328 --> 09:47.949
They may not be too happy
to have Mommy Dearest back home

09:48.237 --> 09:50.373
looking for her cut.

10:09.657 --> 10:12.155
You've got a slick operation,
Janine...

10:12.232 --> 10:15.296
Slick enough that your boys
can run it without you.

10:15.505 --> 10:18.399
They've grown up,
moved on.

10:18.476 --> 10:20.030
They don't need you.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.616
I don't think they
even want you.

10:24.983 --> 10:27.569
Thanks for the ride,
Detective.

10:49.229 --> 10:51.676
What the hell do people do
out here?

10:55.407 --> 10:57.197
Jesus Christ.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.612
Really?

11:01.606 --> 11:02.809
It's shit like that, man.

11:02.886 --> 11:05.245
You just...
You're gonna leave that there?

11:05.426 --> 11:06.588
Put it out!

11:06.665 --> 11:08.243
What are you,
Smokey the Bear?

11:08.320 --> 11:10.155
You want to start a fire?

11:13.183 --> 11:15.561
That... is... awesome.

11:15.638 --> 11:16.724
Happy now?

11:16.801 --> 11:17.813
Yeah.

11:17.890 --> 11:21.259
Man, that's funny.
You worried about fires.

11:23.271 --> 11:25.116
Remember that time you lit one
in the RV?

11:25.193 --> 11:28.270
Oh, I remember
a lot of things, man...

11:28.554 --> 11:30.565
A lot of things.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.978
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Like what?

11:33.055 --> 11:35.929
Like the time that you
locked me in a closet

11:36.353 --> 11:40.457
and you went to score and you
forgot about me for three days?

11:40.822 --> 11:42.494
Why would you do that
to a kid?

11:42.728 --> 11:44.938
Okay, first of all,
that never happened.

11:49.399 --> 11:52.115
It was a day and a half.
What...

11:53.214 --> 11:54.548
I was a kid.
What do you want me to do?

11:54.625 --> 11:56.242
Iwas the kid.

11:56.319 --> 11:59.432
You were... You were an adult.
You were... You were 25.

11:59.509 --> 12:02.969
Yeah, well, technically,
the male brain doesn't mature

12:03.046 --> 12:04.830
until age 26, okay?

12:04.907 --> 12:06.666
So we were both kids.

12:06.902 --> 12:08.392
Okay.

12:11.241 --> 12:15.446
Goddamn, man, you're like a...
You're like an... elephant.

12:15.724 --> 12:17.032
Can't forget anything.

12:17.109 --> 12:18.595
I was trying
to make conversation, dude.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.699
I was trying to, you know,
break the ice.

12:20.893 --> 12:22.855
Not enough for you
to bust my balls,

12:22.932 --> 12:26.414
like you're my boss on a job
that I brought to you guys?

12:26.491 --> 12:29.027
Now you want to dig up
every shit-stained moment

12:29.104 --> 12:30.705
from our past?

12:32.086 --> 12:34.952
I should've locked you
in the closet for three weeks.

12:35.029 --> 12:36.749
You're still an asshole.

12:40.313 --> 12:42.551
Pain in the ass he is.

12:48.229 --> 12:49.754
You cool, man.

12:50.523 --> 12:52.341
Uh...

12:53.631 --> 12:56.164
You got anything?
You got any Oxy or anything?

12:56.349 --> 12:58.291
No. Sorry.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.236
How long we gotta
sit out here?

13:04.358 --> 13:06.252
Uh...

13:06.880 --> 13:09.118
about five minutes.

13:43.774 --> 13:45.300
We missed the drop point,

13:45.377 --> 13:47.424
so we gotta
make up some distance.

13:47.501 --> 13:50.929
Head west, and don't drop
your chute until I do.

14:49.119 --> 14:50.761
Oh, shit.

14:51.706 --> 14:52.795
- Are you okay?
- Holy shit.

14:52.872 --> 14:54.229
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:54.306 --> 14:55.958
Help me up.

14:57.365 --> 14:58.554
Oh, shit.

14:58.688 --> 15:00.837
Almost hit the rocks, man.

15:02.934 --> 15:04.693
Where the hell
are we?

15:11.987 --> 15:13.992
This isn't good, man.
This isn't good.

15:14.069 --> 15:15.527
Took too long
in the air.

15:15.817 --> 15:17.263
We're 48 miles
from the drop point.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.285
Shit! We're on the other side
of the Goddamn mountain.

15:19.362 --> 15:21.196
Look, man, I thought you
said you had this.

15:23.476 --> 15:24.635
Call Pope.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.186
- No service.
- Shit.

15:27.263 --> 15:30.212
He can track us by GPS, man.
It's okay. It's not okay.

15:30.322 --> 15:32.094
The pilots are gonna find
the next landing strip,

15:32.171 --> 15:33.030
they're gonna
call the cops,

15:33.107 --> 15:34.290
and they're gonna tell them
where we jumped.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.347
We gotta bury it
right now.

15:35.424 --> 15:37.525
If anybody sees us like this,
we're finished!

15:52.897 --> 15:55.396
Come on.
They should be here by now.

15:56.858 --> 15:58.515
Shit. It looks like
they've landed.

15:58.592 --> 16:01.162
"Looks like"?
What does that mean, looks like?

16:02.617 --> 16:04.269
It's Deran.
You know what to do.

16:04.346 --> 16:05.417
Shit.

16:05.561 --> 16:06.669
Where are they?

16:06.746 --> 16:08.734
48 miles southeast.

16:09.408 --> 16:11.083
They're on the other side
of that mountain.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.100
What?

16:12.177 --> 16:14.351
The closest road
is the 522.

16:14.428 --> 16:15.930
Aw, man. How long's
this shit gonna take?

16:16.007 --> 16:17.463
I-I got stuff I gotta do
back in Oceanside.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.348
It's gonna take
as long as it takes.

16:38.943 --> 16:40.539
- Hello.
- Mm.

16:41.729 --> 16:42.991
Oh, hey.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.657
Oh, my God.

16:49.127 --> 16:50.635
Are you Smurf?

16:50.784 --> 16:52.670
Good guess.

16:53.586 --> 16:55.759
Uh, welcome home?

16:56.831 --> 16:58.818
Are you here
all by yourself?

16:59.084 --> 17:00.270
No.

17:00.374 --> 17:03.660
I came here
with Billy.

17:05.762 --> 17:07.359
Where is he now?

17:07.648 --> 17:09.171
He is, uh...

17:09.262 --> 17:13.523
He is out
with your boys.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.769
He's out with myboys?

17:19.053 --> 17:20.943
All of my boys?

17:38.437 --> 17:40.430
Do you think they
have a phone?

17:41.150 --> 17:43.194
I doubt they
have a toilet.

17:50.188 --> 17:52.217
Hey, it's me.
Leave a message.

17:52.294 --> 17:54.226
Smurf's back.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.700
You shouldn't be
doing that.

18:01.024 --> 18:02.418
It's fine.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.966
No, no.
I'll do it.

18:05.236 --> 18:06.857
You just got out.

18:07.891 --> 18:09.143
Really?

18:09.350 --> 18:10.550
Yes.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.937
Let me draw you
a nice, hot bath.

18:13.014 --> 18:15.975
I-I-I have some essential oils
that are...

18:16.059 --> 18:17.833
They're great
for detoxifying.

18:17.910 --> 18:21.769
And, um, I should get you
some arnica for that eye.

18:23.532 --> 18:24.838
Sure.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.561
Oh, shit.
There's someone inside.

18:48.364 --> 18:49.931
Hey.

18:51.493 --> 18:52.897
We were, uh, hiking.

18:52.974 --> 18:54.470
We got lost.

18:54.636 --> 18:56.144
Hiking where?

18:56.312 --> 18:58.180
Just on the other side
of the mountain.

19:00.004 --> 19:02.049
Do you have a phone
we could use?

19:02.517 --> 19:03.716
No.

19:04.898 --> 19:06.561
But I have some water.

19:18.579 --> 19:20.306
Oh. Thank you.

19:21.967 --> 19:24.588
So, do you know anywhere
we can get reception?

19:24.782 --> 19:26.025
In town.

19:27.387 --> 19:29.149
And where is that?

19:29.886 --> 19:31.114
20 miles.

19:34.767 --> 19:36.961
You think we could buy
that truck off you?

19:37.038 --> 19:38.309
No.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.631
But I could
give you a ride.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.308
Yeah, that...
That would be great.

19:45.014 --> 19:46.261
10 grand.

19:50.615 --> 19:53.333
You know that truck's
not even worth 10 bucks, right?

19:53.937 --> 19:55.524
It's 5 grand
for the ride,

19:55.601 --> 19:58.394
plus another 5
to forget I saw you out here.

20:03.626 --> 20:05.037
What's in the bags?

20:06.988 --> 20:09.795
You know we could just
take your truck, right?

20:12.891 --> 20:15.520
You gonna shoot me
in front of my kids?

20:23.660 --> 20:24.945
10 grand.

20:35.767 --> 20:37.231
Yo, they've moved.

20:37.308 --> 20:38.457
What?

20:38.534 --> 20:40.540
Yeah, they moved
like half a mile.

20:40.617 --> 20:42.306
They gotta be walking.

20:43.057 --> 20:44.859
Check the
police scanner.

20:44.957 --> 20:46.635
- Anything?
- Nope.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.047
Not so far.
Goddamn it, man.

20:49.201 --> 20:51.204
We were supposed to be done
an hour ago, okay?

20:51.281 --> 20:52.871
I didn't sign up for this shit.
What did you sign up for?

20:52.948 --> 20:55.045
You want to... You want to tag
along, get paid to do nothing?

20:55.122 --> 20:56.135
Hey, you know what?

20:56.212 --> 20:59.319
- This is myjob, asshole.Again. Again!
- Dude, chill. Chill! How many times

20:59.396 --> 21:00.024
are you gonna say it?

21:00.101 --> 21:01.492
- As often as I want!
- Oh, God.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.916
Okay, that's why we're out
here... because of me!

21:03.993 --> 21:05.185
My idea!

21:07.074 --> 21:08.974
- You want me to chill?
- Yeah.

21:09.090 --> 21:11.035
Find a truck stop,
pull over,

21:11.112 --> 21:13.989
give me five minutes,
I'll be chill.

21:15.132 --> 21:16.840
Are you strung out?

21:17.650 --> 21:20.096
- Why don't you blow me?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:20.173 --> 21:22.069
Goddamn babysitting.

21:22.146 --> 21:23.364
I tell you what

21:23.441 --> 21:25.402
find one of those mega ones
with the hookers,

21:25.479 --> 21:27.574
I'll be chill in
like three minutes.

21:28.058 --> 21:29.847
Yo,
I could take a leak.

21:31.713 --> 21:33.425
We're gonna have to stop
for gas anyway. Why not?

21:33.502 --> 21:34.760
- Yes.
- No!

21:34.837 --> 21:36.242
That's right.

21:36.757 --> 21:38.453
He doesn't care
if you piss your pants.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.211
- You know why?
- Why?

21:40.694 --> 21:43.025
'Cause he was in diapers
till he was 6.

21:44.249 --> 21:46.410
God, man, I remember that
like it was yesterday.

21:46.487 --> 21:48.277
The doctor said
he was regressing.

21:48.363 --> 21:52.957
Personally... I think it was
'cause he liked the feeling

21:53.034 --> 21:55.602
of Smurf's hands
in between his legs.

21:56.196 --> 21:58.746
Dude, I'm serious,
I can't tell you how many times

21:58.823 --> 22:00.318
I was banging your mom... Yeah?

22:00.395 --> 22:01.826
And we'd feel like
somebody was watching us.

22:01.903 --> 22:03.913
- We'd look up...
- There's be Pope.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.104
Little Pope
just staring at us.

22:07.685 --> 22:09.473
Without even blinking.

22:10.318 --> 22:13.600
Yeah, that was some
twisted shit.

22:19.510 --> 22:22.146
Hey!
Goddamn it.

22:23.137 --> 22:24.921
Dude.

22:32.557 --> 22:35.343
Pope. Hey!

22:35.848 --> 22:37.103
Dude.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.009
Hey!

22:40.023 --> 22:42.217
Screw you, man!

22:51.574 --> 22:54.780
You were right
about those oils.

22:55.468 --> 22:58.855
Here.
It's vodka cranberry.

22:58.932 --> 22:59.935
Thank you.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.462
You're welcome.

23:04.602 --> 23:07.851
Mmm.
Exactly what I needed.

23:08.559 --> 23:11.198
I figured.
The first thing my dad wanted

23:11.275 --> 23:13.964
when he got out
was a bath and a beer.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.956
Where was that?

23:18.796 --> 23:20.888
Just outside Spokane.

23:22.770 --> 23:24.583
That where you grew up?

23:25.199 --> 23:27.306
Just for
a couple of years.

23:35.618 --> 23:38.734
Well, uh, let me know when
you're ready for another.

23:38.961 --> 23:40.616
Hey, Frankie?

23:40.861 --> 23:42.107
Yeah?

23:42.625 --> 23:45.541
Do you always
come on this strong?

23:55.465 --> 23:57.745
It's a shitty
place to meet...

23:57.822 --> 23:59.252
Wide open.

24:01.278 --> 24:02.892
Check the highways.

24:07.989 --> 24:10.448
Yeah, I'm not seeing
any roadblocks yet.

24:15.091 --> 24:16.382
Deran's gonna be pissed.

24:16.459 --> 24:18.132
- About what?
- Ditching Billy.

24:18.209 --> 24:20.198
I don't give a shit.
Screw him.

24:20.275 --> 24:21.639
What is up with you?

24:21.716 --> 24:22.685
Nothing.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.861
You've been acting weird
all day.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.522
That's just my personality,
bro.

24:33.608 --> 24:36.467
Seriously, though...

24:37.465 --> 24:40.122
I've been thinking
about Baz.

24:42.131 --> 24:44.151
It feels like
we're forgetting him.

24:45.708 --> 24:47.423
That's not true, man.

24:50.230 --> 24:53.166
You ever think it was Smurf
who had him killed?

24:53.601 --> 24:54.842
No.

24:55.151 --> 24:56.947
No way.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.483
Why?
You hear something?

24:59.936 --> 25:01.018
Maybe.

25:01.095 --> 25:02.150
From who?

25:02.227 --> 25:03.899
Doesn't matter.

25:05.665 --> 25:07.984
No.
No, that can't be right.

25:08.061 --> 25:10.619
He stole Smurf's shit.
He framed her for murder.

25:10.696 --> 25:12.798
You think she's just
gonna let that go?

25:16.054 --> 25:17.956
Well, Baz is family.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.814
Yo.
Yo, it's them.

25:27.774 --> 25:29.322
Who's this?

25:29.399 --> 25:31.463
Who is that?
I don't know.

25:33.606 --> 25:35.095
Who's that?
Who is that?

25:35.172 --> 25:36.612
Don't worry about it.
S-She's cool.

25:36.689 --> 25:38.438
- Who is it?
- She's cool, man. Let's go.

25:38.515 --> 25:40.836
Where's Billy? We was being an asshole,
so Pope threw him out.

25:40.913 --> 25:42.652
- Are you kidding me?
- Wait, you guys just left him there?

25:42.729 --> 25:43.935
- Yes.
- Yeah.

25:44.021 --> 25:45.384
- We can't do that, man.
- Why?

25:45.461 --> 25:46.557
Because this is
his job!

25:46.634 --> 25:48.230
And during his job,
he wanted to score,

25:48.307 --> 25:49.327
so that's what
he's up to.

25:49.404 --> 25:50.834
No. That's bullshit.
We got to go back.

25:50.911 --> 25:52.591
I told you the cops
were onto us!

25:52.668 --> 25:55.757
- Are you out of your mind?
- All right, it's fine. Let's go.

26:20.889 --> 26:22.648
Hello, Billy.

26:23.046 --> 26:24.318
Smurf.

26:24.715 --> 26:26.239
What's up?

26:28.018 --> 26:29.429
Are you out?

26:30.802 --> 26:32.405
Surprise.

26:33.033 --> 26:34.360
Yeah.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.555
Yeah. That's good, man.
That's great.

26:36.632 --> 26:38.272
Wow. When did...
When did you, uh...

26:38.349 --> 26:40.161
When'd you get out?

26:40.875 --> 26:43.593
Are you with my boys,
Billy?

26:44.807 --> 26:46.850
Ye... Uh, no.

26:46.927 --> 26:50.233
I was with them,
and now I'm at a truck st...

26:50.310 --> 26:54.382
Truck stop,
and, uh, so

26:54.739 --> 26:57.216
Where are my boys?

26:58.715 --> 27:00.367
I, uh...

27:00.606 --> 27:03.167
They had to go
somewhere,

27:03.244 --> 27:05.648
and, uh, they had a...

27:05.725 --> 27:09.299
They had to go
someplace, so...

27:10.512 --> 27:12.859
You sound good.
You sound, uh...

27:12.960 --> 27:14.286
You good?

27:15.062 --> 27:16.666
Yeah. I'm great.

27:16.743 --> 27:18.093
Um, okay.

27:18.580 --> 27:20.685
You sound...
You sound good.

27:21.923 --> 27:25.793
Hey...
is Frankie around?

27:25.886 --> 27:27.605
Frankie's in the shower.

27:27.944 --> 27:29.943
So, uh, would you
just tell her,

27:30.020 --> 27:33.698
uh, give me a call
when she comes out?

27:33.983 --> 27:36.408
Not a problem.
Anything else?

27:36.834 --> 27:39.451
No, I'm, uh... I got to go,
actually, 'cause, uh...

27:39.547 --> 27:40.847
Billy...

27:41.808 --> 27:44.458
I can't wait to see you.

27:44.535 --> 27:45.837
Uh, my...

27:45.989 --> 27:47.354
Bye.

27:48.566 --> 27:50.309
Oh, shit.

28:07.237 --> 28:08.866
Get the bleach.

28:10.763 --> 28:13.607
Make sure you wipe the dash
and the steering wheel.

28:40.009 --> 28:43.733
Electronic locks. 24-hour
live video feed in the hallway

28:43.810 --> 28:44.951
goes straight to
your phones.

28:45.028 --> 28:47.221
Any time the door opens,
we all get a text.

28:47.869 --> 28:49.581
Electronic locks?

28:50.104 --> 28:52.450
Your phone's the key.
Just got to download the app.

28:52.527 --> 28:53.998
I like regular locks.

28:54.075 --> 28:55.929
Well, I like locks
you can't pick.

28:56.085 --> 28:57.951
I got $435,000.

28:58.028 --> 29:01.999
Well, I have $355,000.

29:02.577 --> 29:06.434
So, that makes $790,000.

29:06.511 --> 29:07.800
Yeah.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.780
We just robbed
a Goddamn plane.

29:09.857 --> 29:11.153
Hell, yeah.

29:11.230 --> 29:12.690
That...
That's a good haul.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.449
Hell, yeah, that's a good haul.
It's almost $1 million!

29:15.583 --> 29:18.266
That's 158 grand each.

29:18.343 --> 29:20.393
Holy shit.

29:20.912 --> 29:23.454
This, um... This is gonna
take a couple months to clean,

29:23.531 --> 29:25.409
so let's start out
with 9 grand each.

29:25.486 --> 29:27.091
Um, what do you want to do
with Billy's cut?

29:27.168 --> 29:29.803
No. We can't let that asshole
walk out with 9 grand.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.245
- You crazy?
- No, It's his job. It's his money.

29:32.322 --> 29:34.482
No, he ripped off
the last grow house he worked.

29:34.584 --> 29:36.411
If he starts walking around
with that kind of cash,

29:36.488 --> 29:39.146
the cops will take notice, and
they'll be onto us in no time.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.189
Okay, fine.
We'll just keep the money

29:42.266 --> 29:44.676
in the safe for now,
and we'll figure it out later.

29:44.753 --> 29:45.919
What about Lena?

29:46.246 --> 29:47.460
What about Lena?

29:47.537 --> 29:49.061
What about her cut?

29:50.042 --> 29:52.138
Baz is dead. She's...

29:52.215 --> 29:53.782
How is she supposed to
take care of herself?

29:53.859 --> 29:55.556
Are you just gonna forget
that she's family?

29:55.633 --> 29:57.749
No, man.
We're not forgetting.

29:57.826 --> 29:59.386
- Are you sure?
- No, no.

29:59.463 --> 30:01.614
We're not. Right?

30:02.119 --> 30:05.149
Of course not.
Yeah, she's in.

30:07.415 --> 30:08.721
Cool.

30:33.861 --> 30:35.514
Hey. What's up?

30:35.600 --> 30:37.315
We need a new fryer.

30:37.766 --> 30:40.152
What do you mean?
It caught fire this morning.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.429
Shit. All right.
Um, I'll take care of it.

30:42.506 --> 30:44.244
- Thanks.
- Hey.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.599
I need you to give
the cab driver $230.

30:48.676 --> 30:51.330
I, uh,
made a couple stops.

30:52.789 --> 30:53.789
Okay.

30:55.737 --> 30:56.973
Hey, beautiful.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.507
Can you grab me
a, uh, water, please?

31:02.595 --> 31:04.008
My name's Kai.

31:04.085 --> 31:05.538
Kai.

31:07.515 --> 31:11.176
Know what your name,
uh, means on the island?

31:12.794 --> 31:14.386
What island?

31:14.798 --> 31:19.272
The island of Hawaii.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.410
Yeah... "ocean."

31:21.543 --> 31:22.821
Right.

31:23.071 --> 31:24.950
- Your dad needs attention.
- Hi.

31:25.027 --> 31:27.313
Yeah, she's not on the menu.
Come on.

31:27.431 --> 31:29.291
Maybe not for you.

31:33.356 --> 31:35.280
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry
we ditched

31:35.357 --> 31:36.138
- you out there.
- No, no, no.

31:36.215 --> 31:37.391
- I tried to talk to Pope about it.
- No, no.

31:37.468 --> 31:39.012
- No, that's all...
- That's minor, man, okay?

31:39.089 --> 31:41.296
I just want to say
one thing to you...

31:41.833 --> 31:45.884
A little piece of, you know,
fatherly advice.

31:45.961 --> 31:46.974
Uh-huh.

31:47.132 --> 31:49.581
You guys shouldn't do any more
stuff with Pope, dude.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.768
He's... He's crazier
than he's ever been.

31:51.845 --> 31:53.611
He's gonna get
you guys all killed.

31:54.493 --> 31:57.248
Now
how'd we do?

32:00.557 --> 32:05.276
With the split,
it's just over 100 grand each.

32:06.281 --> 32:07.616
E-Each?

32:07.810 --> 32:09.038
Be chill.

32:09.244 --> 32:11.755
Dude, I'm chill.
Shit.

32:12.081 --> 32:13.310
Wow.

32:13.387 --> 32:15.017
Goddamn.

32:15.094 --> 32:16.008
Yeah.

32:16.085 --> 32:17.641
Shit.

32:18.924 --> 32:20.891
I'm so Goddamn proud of you.
I don't even know.

32:20.968 --> 32:22.886
That's... Dude.

32:24.415 --> 32:26.392
- I know.
- Okay.

32:28.942 --> 32:32.016
So, let me...
Let me just ask you this.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.657
Do you think you...

32:34.734 --> 32:38.307
could ever call me "Dad"?

32:41.249 --> 32:42.517
No.

32:43.479 --> 32:44.611
Come on.

32:44.774 --> 32:46.423
Is that...
What, is that a joke?

32:46.500 --> 32:47.869
- No.
- No.

32:47.946 --> 32:48.973
Okay.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.694
I get it.

32:52.894 --> 32:54.234
Can I crash here tonight?

32:54.311 --> 32:55.250
Are you kidding me? No.

32:55.327 --> 32:56.860
What are you...
You're staying at Smurf's.

32:56.937 --> 32:59.097
Yeah, well...

33:00.365 --> 33:02.005
Smurf's out.

33:03.208 --> 33:04.176
Yeah.

33:04.466 --> 33:06.415
I should've... So, yeah. Wh... Wh...

33:06.492 --> 33:07.842
Smurf's out? What?
What do you mean, Smurf's out?

33:07.919 --> 33:09.288
They sprung her
this morning.

33:09.365 --> 33:11.586
So, I'm looking for a ride.
I call Frankie.

33:11.836 --> 33:14.360
Who answers the phone?
Smurf.

33:16.372 --> 33:17.895
Yeah.

33:20.182 --> 33:22.352
Almost ruined my high...

33:23.282 --> 33:24.647
Almost.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.570
Dude...

33:28.210 --> 33:30.035
proud of you.

33:30.838 --> 33:32.381
Yeah.

33:32.823 --> 33:34.234
Proud of you.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.261
Who's cooking?

34:11.743 --> 34:13.918
Holy shit.

34:33.658 --> 34:35.025
Hey, Smurf.

34:37.763 --> 34:40.098
I didn't know you were
getting out today.

34:40.672 --> 34:42.371
Me neither.

34:43.626 --> 34:45.739
Want to give your mommy
a hug?

34:50.697 --> 34:52.309
Beautiful.

34:55.002 --> 34:57.228
Yo, check it out.

34:57.674 --> 34:59.682
We should throw a party,
right?

35:00.074 --> 35:01.387
Smurf's back.

35:01.464 --> 35:04.409
I'd rather just have dinner
with my boys.

35:05.254 --> 35:06.917
Okay.

35:07.747 --> 35:10.081
Put the salad
on the table for me?

35:10.215 --> 35:12.671
Yeah, okay. Thank you, baby.

35:32.646 --> 35:35.592
Good to hold you again,
baby.

35:36.820 --> 35:38.530
Did you miss me?

35:45.026 --> 35:48.043
You look like you had
a big day.

35:49.276 --> 35:52.388
Maybe you should take a shower
before dinner.

35:53.167 --> 35:56.725
I moved all of your things
out of my room,

35:56.848 --> 35:59.346
and fresh towels
are on your bed.

36:01.682 --> 36:03.113
Thank you.

36:04.032 --> 36:05.480
Of course.

36:37.755 --> 36:40.036
I missed you, baby.

36:43.004 --> 36:45.000
How the hell
did you get out?

36:45.077 --> 36:48.635
Jail break... hopped a fence,
made a run for it.

36:50.656 --> 36:52.850
They dropped the charges.

36:55.190 --> 36:58.336
'Cause we all know
the charges were bullshit.

37:01.892 --> 37:03.428
How's Lena?

37:05.983 --> 37:07.785
She's good, you know?

37:09.773 --> 37:11.414
She misses you.

37:14.079 --> 37:16.435
She's at
Allison's tonight.

37:21.889 --> 37:23.974
I want to see her
tomorrow.

37:32.705 --> 37:34.149
That hurt?

37:38.407 --> 37:40.819
Only when I look at it.

38:14.496 --> 38:15.601
So, she's back.

38:15.678 --> 38:17.567
Yeah.
She's making meatloaf.

38:17.644 --> 38:21.413
The table's all set.
Dude, she even made a pie.

38:21.490 --> 38:22.675
What happened?

38:22.752 --> 38:24.307
I don't know.

38:24.455 --> 38:27.182
I figured she'd tell us
when she's ready.

38:27.490 --> 38:30.129
Okay.
How does she seem?

38:30.271 --> 38:31.514
Good.

38:31.883 --> 38:35.263
I mean, it's kind of like
she never left. It's weird.

38:35.340 --> 38:37.836
Okay. Is she pissed that
we didn't go to visit her?

38:37.913 --> 38:39.261
Uh, no.

38:39.835 --> 38:42.944
I-I-I... Look, I don't know.
I mean, I...

38:43.191 --> 38:44.997
I kind of paid her
a visit, so...

38:45.074 --> 38:46.065
What? When?

38:46.142 --> 38:47.448
I don't know.
Like, a while back.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.401
I just popped in
for a sec.

38:49.478 --> 38:50.447
Are you kidding me, Craig?

38:50.524 --> 38:52.289
You're just gonna
tell me this right now?

38:52.494 --> 38:54.464
I...

38:55.419 --> 38:57.778
She's gonna kill me.

38:57.978 --> 38:59.076
Yeah.

38:59.810 --> 39:01.403
Hello?

39:05.126 --> 39:06.468
Hey.

39:06.835 --> 39:08.097
You cool?

39:10.165 --> 39:11.688
Yeah.

39:12.883 --> 39:14.510
You talk to her?

39:17.793 --> 39:19.100
No.

39:23.836 --> 39:25.784
You know, it's not like
I wanted her to die in there.

39:25.861 --> 39:27.532
It's just, uh...

39:28.836 --> 39:30.561
I don't know.

39:30.780 --> 39:34.348
You were hoping you never
had to see her again.

39:34.895 --> 39:36.167
I get it.

39:39.099 --> 39:40.771
No, you don't.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.194
You left. You...

39:45.391 --> 39:47.481
You took off.
You bailed.

39:48.156 --> 39:50.072
Because I get it.

39:50.235 --> 39:51.421
Okay.

39:51.498 --> 39:55.094
Listen, you know,
I-I...

39:55.878 --> 40:00.550
I tried
to take you with me.

40:02.673 --> 40:03.630
Yeah?

40:03.715 --> 40:06.581
I did, okay?

40:07.517 --> 40:11.212
Smurf was so busy with
Craig and the psycho

40:11.295 --> 40:13.208
she barely had
any time for you.

40:13.285 --> 40:14.915
I thought I could
do better.

40:15.078 --> 40:18.681
So... me and you
were headed to Reno.

40:19.197 --> 40:22.252
Dude,
you were loving it.

40:22.329 --> 40:26.300
You were having
such a kickass time.

40:26.963 --> 40:29.515
I figured, you know,
you're pretty easy.

40:29.592 --> 40:31.041
Chicks dig babies.

40:31.118 --> 40:34.876
No time at all,
you'd have... a brand-new mama.

40:49.886 --> 40:51.665
So, what happened?

40:51.752 --> 40:54.412
Smurf calls
the Goddamn Feds.

40:56.055 --> 41:01.015
And they caught up with us
just outside Topaz Lake.

41:02.388 --> 41:06.897
She, uh... She says she'll drop
the kidnapping charges

41:06.974 --> 41:11.454
if I agree to leave
and never come back.

41:16.854 --> 41:19.388
I'm sorry, kid.
I tried, man.

41:19.465 --> 41:21.457
I did my best, but I...

41:21.829 --> 41:24.429
I just couldn't
beat her.

41:26.563 --> 41:28.472
And then, you know...

41:28.906 --> 41:30.273
life happened.

41:57.125 --> 41:59.117
Thank you.

42:04.717 --> 42:07.104
Be a shame if Billy
didn't make it back

42:07.181 --> 42:09.740
in time for my
welcome-home dinner.

42:10.378 --> 42:12.651
He's probably
with Deran.

42:13.437 --> 42:14.907
Mm.

42:16.182 --> 42:17.977
How's Deran, baby?

42:18.054 --> 42:19.386
Good.

42:19.928 --> 42:22.176
I mean, busy.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.208
The bar still
going strong?

42:24.285 --> 42:26.905
Yeah. Yeah.

42:27.332 --> 42:28.298
Mm.

42:29.377 --> 42:31.306
And where's Nicky?

42:31.854 --> 42:33.775
I didn't see any of
her things around

42:33.852 --> 42:35.755
when I cleaned up
the house.

42:35.832 --> 42:39.683
Nicky went to Guam
to be with her dad.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.013
She did?

42:41.551 --> 42:43.267
Yeah, man.
We broke up.

42:45.079 --> 42:46.211
Again?

42:47.562 --> 42:48.575
Yeah.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.876
She's... She's gone.

42:51.329 --> 42:53.353
I hope you don't
feel too bad.

42:53.449 --> 42:55.305
You weren't in love
with that girl, baby.

42:55.382 --> 42:56.722
You know that.

42:59.859 --> 43:05.414
Okay. Well, Billy is somewhere.
Nicky's in Guam.

43:05.896 --> 43:09.903
Okay. Now that we know
who's where,

43:09.980 --> 43:12.286
why don't you tell me
how your day went?

43:16.076 --> 43:17.408
Come on.

43:17.624 --> 43:20.819
Don't tell me I baked that pie
for nothing.

43:26.575 --> 43:28.292
Oh, I see.

43:29.330 --> 43:32.752
Your job,
not my business.

43:33.526 --> 43:35.059
Fine.

43:36.858 --> 43:39.664
Craig, take me to see
my son tomorrow.

43:40.204 --> 43:41.920
I want to see Baz.

43:44.599 --> 43:47.188
There's no grave,
Smurf.

43:48.275 --> 43:49.640
Why?

43:51.087 --> 43:54.699
We, um...
We had a paddle out.

43:54.813 --> 43:57.095
No headstone
to weep over.

44:01.094 --> 44:03.864
We're gonna have to
change that.

44:04.663 --> 44:07.916
Lena needs a place
to visit her father.

44:12.388 --> 44:14.539
And so do we.

44:21.714 --> 44:23.325
To Baz.

44:25.824 --> 44:28.661
Rest in peace,
beautiful boy.

44:35.716 --> 44:37.603
To Baz.
