00:03.437 --> 00:05.039
(Meredith)
DYING CHANGES EVERYTHING.

00:05.073 --> 00:08.542
THERE'S THE EMOTIONAL FALLOUT,
SURE.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.145
BUT THERE'S ALSO
THE PRACTICAL STUFF.

00:11.179 --> 00:13.347
WHO'S GOING TO DO
YOUR JOB?

00:13.381 --> 00:16.517
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF YOUR FAMILY?

00:16.550 --> 00:18.452
THE ONLY GOOD THING
FOR YOU IS,

00:18.486 --> 00:20.388
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.524
PEOPLE YOU NEVER KNEW
WILL BE LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE,

00:23.557 --> 00:25.259
WORKING YOUR JOB.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.128
THE WORLD
JUST KEEPS ON GOING...

00:27.161 --> 00:28.796
WITHOUT YOU.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.398
STEPH, I NEED A FAVOR.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.533
I'LL DO YOUR SCUT
FOR A WEEK--

00:32.566 --> 00:33.634
TWO WEEKS--
AND BEFORE YOU SAY NO,

00:33.667 --> 00:35.436
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY TODAY.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.138
AND YOU'RE THE MOST TALENTED
INTERN IN OUR CLASS,

00:37.171 --> 00:38.406
AND I'M IN NO WAY TRYING
TO BUTTER YOU UP

00:38.439 --> 00:39.807
SO YOU DNO.T SAY NO.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.409
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU YET.

00:41.442 --> 00:42.810
YES, I DO. I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR MEDUSA FOR YOU.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.080
I WANT TO LIVE
SO I WILL SAY IT AGAIN--NO.

00:46.114 --> 00:46.947
(elevator bell dings)

00:46.980 --> 00:49.117
(Rilo Kiley)
* ...LEADS TO TOUCHING

00:49.150 --> 00:50.818
* AND TOUCHING
TO LEADS TO SEX *

00:50.851 --> 00:54.188
NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF.
SHE'S JUST AN ATTENDING.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.856
WE ONLY CALL HER MEDUSA
BECAUSE--

00:55.889 --> 00:58.492
BECAUSE SHE'S A MONSTER
OF MYTHIC PROPORTIONS.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.493
(ding)

00:59.527 --> 01:01.295
* AND IT'S BAD NEWS

01:01.329 --> 01:04.098
* I'M JUST BAD NEWS,
BAD NEWS *

01:04.132 --> 01:07.335
* BAD NEWS

01:07.368 --> 01:08.636
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

01:08.669 --> 01:11.472
I HAVE THESE LABS
FOR DR. GREY.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.374
WELL, THEN GIVE THEM
TO HER.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.209
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THOSE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.344
I HAD TO DO AN ADMISSION--

01:16.377 --> 01:17.878
STOP MAKING EXCUSES.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.846
SORRY.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.181
STOP APOLOGIZING.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.249
OKAY.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.350
STOP TALKING.

01:22.383 --> 01:26.220
HIS LACTIC ACID IS NORMAL.
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

01:26.254 --> 01:28.156
YOU CAN TALK NOW.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.390
THAT HE'S PROBABLY
NOT SEPTIC,

01:29.423 --> 01:30.658
SO HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.661
ALTHOUGH HIS WHITE CELL COUNT
IS ELEVATED

01:33.694 --> 01:35.263
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY
KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.165
IN FACT, I WILL KEEP
AN EYE ON THAT

01:37.198 --> 01:38.666
GO TO THE PIT
AND TRY NOT TO KILL ANYBODY.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.234
(ding)

01:40.268 --> 01:44.172
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

01:44.205 --> 01:45.906
(chuckles) IMPRESSIVE.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.677
I WOULD'VE EXPECTED THAT LEVEL
OF INTIMIDATION FROM YANG MAYBE.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.145
NOT YOU.

01:51.179 --> 01:54.415
HOW IS YANG, BY THE WAY?
DOES SHE LIKE MINNESOTA?

01:54.448 --> 01:57.418
SHE LOVES IT.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.687
(siren wailing)

01:59.720 --> 02:02.223
(door opens)

02:02.256 --> 02:03.591
DR. PARKER.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.193
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
I REALIZED...

02:05.226 --> 02:06.460
DR. PARKER.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.196
THAT THERE WAS
A TUMOR(chuckles)

02:08.229 --> 02:09.297
I MEAN, WE HAD SPENT, UH,
THREE HOURS

02:09.330 --> 02:10.564
TRYING TO DEAL
WITH THE VALVE--

02:10.598 --> 02:12.433
OH, DR. YANG.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.202
YOU'VE GOTTA HEAR ABOUT
THIS CASE DR. THOMAS HAD--

02:14.235 --> 02:15.936
MUST BE WHAT,
TEN YEARS AGO?

02:15.969 --> 02:16.837
YEAH.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.706
UM, I LOOKED AT
THE OBERMAN BABY'S SCANS.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.908
UH, I KNOW WE DISCUSSED
DOING A THORACOTOMY,

02:20.941 --> 02:23.244
BUT I THINK A V.A.T.S.
MAKES MORE SENSE.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.345
FANTASTIC.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.580
BUT LET DR. THOMAS TELL YOU
ABOUT THIS STORY FIRST.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.182
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
YOUR EARS.

02:28.216 --> 02:30.318
HOW ABOUT I SCRUB IN
WITH YOU

02:30.351 --> 02:32.320
AND THEN I CAN TELL YOU
THE WHOLE STORY?

02:32.353 --> 02:33.454
WHEN'S YOUR SURGERY?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.722
11:00.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.458
OH, THAT WON'T WORK.
I HAVE A BYPASS AT 11:00.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.592
OH.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.261
WHY DON'T YOU MOVE
YOUR SURGERY BACK

02:40.294 --> 02:41.329
AND THEN I CAN JOIN YOU?

02:41.362 --> 02:42.430
UH, THAT'S REALLY
NOT NECESSARY.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.932
AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO, UH, WATCH MY 11:00.

02:44.965 --> 02:48.336
IT'S A PORT-CABG.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE?

02:48.369 --> 02:50.338
I'VE DONE ONE.
THREE IN FACT.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.940
WELL, THEN YOU'LL APPRECIATE
MY APPROACH.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.742
IT'S EVEN BETTER.
WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.345
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
MY AMBULANCE ISN'T HERE YET.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.480
I CAN START THE STORY NOW.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.350
THE PATIENT WAS 66.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.218
ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD START

03:04.252 --> 03:06.420
WHEN I FIRST MET THE MAN.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.988
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:08.021 --> 03:11.225
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:16.664 --> 03:17.765
(sighs)

03:17.798 --> 03:20.701
JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW,
WE'RE ALL SET FOR TONIGHT.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.003
UNLESS YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS
OR CONCERNS.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.239
I DON'T.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.441
OKAY. UM...

03:27.475 --> 03:30.244
5:00.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.412
OKAY.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.448
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

03:37.285 --> 03:38.986
(smart phone chimes)

03:39.019 --> 03:41.555
(Miranda) HOW OFTEN SHOULD HER
CALCIUM LEVELS BE MONITORED?

03:41.589 --> 03:42.756
EVERY 12 HOURS.

03:42.790 --> 03:46.627
AND WHAT'S THE PRIMARY CAUSE
OF HYPOCALCEMIA

03:46.660 --> 03:48.662
AFTER PARATHYROID SURGERY?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.331
UM...

03:50.364 --> 03:52.266
REALLY?

03:52.300 --> 03:54.735
ARE YOU TELLING ME
NOT ONE OF YOU KNOWS THAT--

03:54.768 --> 03:56.537
HUNGRY BONE SYNDROME...

03:56.570 --> 03:59.407
WHERE CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS
ARE RAPIDLY DEPOSITED

03:59.440 --> 04:00.574
INTO THE BONE.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.009
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.278
GOT A LAST-MINUTE FLIGHT.
COULDN'T PASS IT UP.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.280
NOT ANYMORE.N CALL TONIGHT?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.316
I SWITCHED SHIFTS.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.318
(chuckles)

04:10.351 --> 04:11.419
WHAT'S YOUR TURNAROUND
THIS TIME?

04:11.452 --> 04:13.721
12 HOURS. AND I PLAN TO MAKE USE
OF EVERY SINGLE ONE.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.022
(elevator bell dings)

04:15.055 --> 04:16.324
(Miranda chuckles)

04:17.591 --> 04:18.692
(knock on door)

04:18.726 --> 04:20.694
OCCUPIED.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.296
MM. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO.

04:22.330 --> 04:25.399
LISTEN... I WISH I COULD
PUT OFF HOPKINS

04:25.433 --> 04:27.401
SO YOU AND I COULD SPEND
MORE TIME TOGETHER,

04:27.435 --> 04:30.438
BUT I'VE ALREADY
POSTPONED THEM ONCE.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.040
MM. I KNOW, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO LIKE IT.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.608
I REALLY HATE GOOD-BYES.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.410
WELL, YOU'LL LIKE THIS ONE.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.078
(giggles)

04:38.111 --> 04:40.681
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:40.714 --> 04:43.083
(siren wailing)

04:43.116 --> 04:46.320
(sighs)

04:46.354 --> 04:48.589
OKAY, WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT THE STARING?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.558
I'M FINE, AND EVEN IF
I WEREN'T,

04:50.591 --> 04:52.560
STARING AT ME
WOULDN'T MAKE ME MORE FINE.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.762
I'M SORRY, DR. TORRES.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.598
REALLY, AVERY? YOU TOO?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.533
NO, NOT STARING.
UH, DEFINITELY NOT.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.868
(clears throat)
EXCUSE ME.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.336
(Derek)
OKAY, WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:02.370 --> 05:03.604
HEY, YOU TELL ME.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.539
LOOKS LIKE
A TRANSVERSE PROCESS FRACTURE

05:05.573 --> 05:07.341
AT L-3, L-4,
BUT SEE THIS SWELLING?

05:07.375 --> 05:08.442
I CAN'T TELL IF IT'S
UNSTABLE OR NOT.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.843
IT'S UNSTOKAY.FOR SURE.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.579
BOOK AN O.R.
WE NEED TO GET IN THERE

05:11.612 --> 05:12.846
AND RELIEVE THE PRESSURE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.348
WAIT. "WE"?

05:14.382 --> 05:15.616
AS IN YOU AND ME?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.117
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.586
ACTUALLY, IT IS.
IT'S--IT'S-- (chuckles)

05:18.619 --> 05:19.853
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.121
I'VE BEEN CLEARED FOR SURGERY
FOR WEEKS.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.590
YEAH, I KNOW,
'CAUSE I CLEARED YOU,

05:22.623 --> 05:23.857
BUT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T READY S--

05:23.891 --> 05:25.393
WELL, NOW I'M SAYING I AM.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.360
WOW. OKAY.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.528
AGAIN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.530
(Meredith) IT IS A BIG DEAL.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.665
I WILL BE DONE
LONG BEFORE 5:00.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.133
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.369
WHY ARE YOU PUTTING
THIS PRESSURE ON YOURSELF?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.738
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
FOR WEEKS. I FEEL GOOD.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.908
I JUST CAN'T SIT AROUND
LOOKING AT THE CLOCK.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.778
YOU REALLY NEED
TO DO THIS TODAY?

05:44.812 --> 05:46.814
YEAH, I DO...

05:46.847 --> 05:49.383
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.484
OKAY.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.586
(siren wailing)

05:52.620 --> 05:55.623
(Callie) I MEAN,
HE SAYS HE'S READY.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.391
AND HIS NERVE GRAFT
SEEMS TO BE READY.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.927
SO I GUESS TODAY'S THE DAY
HE'S GONNA OPERATE...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.430
(sighs)
WITH HIS BRAND-NEW HAND.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.432
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:04.465 --> 06:09.403
AND IT IS GONNA WORK.
IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA WORK.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.440
(ventilator clicking)

06:12.473 --> 06:14.608
YOU THINK IT'S GONNA WORK,
RIGHT?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.810
I THOUGHT I MIGHT FIND YOU
IN HERE.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.812
(sighs) I KEEP THINKING
IF I SAY SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH

06:18.846 --> 06:21.181
OR... (chuckles)
SHOCKING ENOUGH,

06:21.214 --> 06:23.484
HE'LL JUST--
HE'LL OPEN HIS EYES.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.185
MM-HMM.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.487
(sighs)

06:26.520 --> 06:29.189
7 HOURS TILL 5:00.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.959
(sighs) HIS DIRECTIVE
WAS VERY SPECIFIC.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.663
IF, AFTER 30 DAYS, THERE ARE
NO SIGNS OF RECOVERY,

06:35.696 --> 06:39.433
MARK WANTED TO BE LET GO.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.969
THAT'S ALL WE'RE DOING...

06:42.002 --> 06:44.204
HONORING HIS WISH.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.840
I KNOW. I JUST...

06:50.243 --> 06:52.212
OH, GOD.
IT'S SO HOT IN HERE.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.848
I THINK I'M GONNA
TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.684
OH, YEAH. THAT'S BETTER.

06:56.717 --> 07:00.588
OH, YEAH, IT'S SO MUCH COOLER
WITH MY BOOBS OUT.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.492
(Derek) WELL, IF THAT
DIDN'T WAKE HIM,

07:04.525 --> 07:05.526
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.761
YEAH.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.732
(sighs)

07:11.765 --> 07:16.470
***

07:17.971 --> 07:21.008
YOU ALWAYS HAD TO BE
THE FIRST.

07:21.041 --> 07:24.044
(beeping and clicking continue)

07:28.982 --> 07:31.519
(clicks)

07:31.552 --> 07:33.487
YOU ARE A TERRIBLE BEST MAN.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.622
ADDISON'S GREAT,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.890
BUT ONE WOMAN
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.526
IT'S NOT WHAT GOD INTENDED.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.326
(chuckles)

07:39.359 --> 07:40.761
ESPECIALLY FOR MEN
WHO LOOK LIKE US.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.897
GOD INTENDED FOR US
MANY, MANY WOMEN,

07:43.931 --> 07:46.534
A STAGGERING NUMBER
OF WOMEN.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.769
(camera zoom whirs)

07:48.802 --> 07:50.771
I JUST HOPE YOU DIDN'T
FORGET THE RINGS.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.906
DEREK...
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.508
(laughs)

07:54.542 --> 07:56.043
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER

07:56.076 --> 07:58.278
FIND ANOTHER FRIEND

07:58.311 --> 08:01.048
AS GOOD AS ME, EVER.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.583
(orchestra music playing)

08:02.616 --> 08:13.561
(whirs)E YOU FILMING THIS?

08:16.630 --> 08:17.798
(clicks)

08:17.831 --> 08:18.866
OKAY, WE'RE NOT DOING THIS,
OKAY?

08:18.899 --> 08:20.734
(laughs) I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS...

08:20.768 --> 08:22.069
SO YOU CAN PUT IT ON
YOUR CREEPY BOOKCASE

08:22.102 --> 08:24.304
WITH ALL YOUR OTHER
CREEPY VIDEOS.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.006
THERE'S NO BOOKCASE.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.608
AND I'VE NEVER
DONE THIS EITHER,

08:27.641 --> 08:29.009
BUT TRUST ME,
WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

08:29.042 --> 08:33.547
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO RELIVE
OVER AND OVER.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.082
(both moan)

08:35.115 --> 08:36.584
(chuckles)

08:36.617 --> 08:38.552
MM. ONE SECOND. (grunts)

08:38.586 --> 08:42.723
(people speaking indistinctly)

08:42.756 --> 08:45.926
UH, THE INTERN APPY--
YOU GOT YOUR GUY?

08:45.959 --> 08:47.628
I (elevator bell dings)

08:47.661 --> 08:50.030
AND YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS TODAY?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.565
ESPECIALLY TODAY.

08:51.599 --> 08:52.566
OKAY.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.001
UH, GREY. HEY.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.571
UM, I NEED YOU TO TAKE
MY 3:00 LAP CHOLE.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.672
OH, I CAN'T.
I HAVE THE INTERN APPY.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.107
OH.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.842
GREY, LIVING UP
TO YOUR NICKNAME.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.812
NICKNAME?
I HAVE A NICKNAME?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.113
(clears throat)

09:08.148 --> 09:10.584
UH, THEY CALL YOU MEDUSA...

09:10.618 --> 09:11.652
(ding)

09:11.685 --> 09:14.855
THE SERPENT-HAIRED MONSTER
WHO TURNS FOLKS TO STONE.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.857
HEY, THIS IS NOT A BAD THING.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.660
YOU WANT TO BE THE ATTENDING
WITH THE SCARY NICKNAME.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.695
IT KEEPS YOUR RESIDENTS
IN LINE.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.597
IT STRIKES FEAR
IN THEIR HEART.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.600
TAKE IT FROM THE NAZI,
IT'S GOOD TO BE FEARED.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.735
YOU RETIRED THE NAZI.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.102
THEY CALL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE NOW.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.704
THEY DO?

09:30.738 --> 09:31.839
THEY DO.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.006
WH--

09:34.174 --> 09:35.643
MM-HMM.

09:35.676 --> 09:36.476
(suction gurgles)

09:36.509 --> 09:38.679
EXCUSE ME, DR. PARKER,
QUICK QUESTION.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.648
OKAY, HANDS UP, EVERYBODY.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.616
ONE, TWO, THREE.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.918
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU,
DR. YANG?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.887
OH, I-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
TO STOP YOUR PROCEDURE.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.622
YOU CAN JUST KEEP GOING
WHILE I TALK.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.757
WE CAN'T, ACTUALLY.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.892
WE FIND THAT MULTITASKING
LEADS TO ERRORS IN HEARING

09:51.925 --> 09:54.628
AND ERRORS IN HEALING.

09:54.662 --> 09:57.030
OKAY. UH, WELL, UM,
DR. THOMAS INVITED HIMSELF

09:57.064 --> 09:58.632
ONTO MY V.A.T.S.
THIS AFTERNOON--

09:58.666 --> 10:00.033
MM-HMM.RMAN BABY.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.035
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD DO
THE PROCEDURE ON MY OWN,

10:02.069 --> 10:03.637
WITHOUT HIM.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.038
HOW COME?

10:05.072 --> 10:08.909
UH, WELL... DR. THOMAS
IS A BIG TALKER AND--

10:08.942 --> 10:10.944
OH, MY GOSH.
THAT IS THE TRUTH.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.647
DR. THOMAS CAN CHEW YOUR EAR
RIGHT OFF.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.649
I-I TELL YOU, ONCE HE CORNERED
ME WITH A STORY,

10:15.683 --> 10:16.750
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE GENTLEMEN'S ROOM.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.151
I HATE TO INVOKE POTTY HUMOR,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.754
BUT I WASN'T SURE
I WAS GONNA MAKE IT.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.790
THAT'S HOW(laughter)STORY WAS.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.191
EXACTLY. SO--

10:24.224 --> 10:26.660
MY ADVICE TO YOU IS,
VISIT THE LADIES ROOM

10:26.694 --> 10:28.195
BEFORE YOU ENTER
(woman) YES.Y.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.130
I WILL, BUT ANOTHER SOLUTION
WOULD BE

10:30.163 --> 10:31.699
IF HE JUST DIDN'T SCRUB IN.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.667
YOU'VE GOT A TOUGH ROW
TO HOE THERE, DR. YANG.

10:33.701 --> 10:34.902
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.436
THANKFULLY,
YOU'RE A TOUGH COOKIE.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.038
YOU'RE UP TO THE TASK.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.773
WE SALUTE YOU.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.110
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

10:43.143 --> 10:44.745
(tablet alert dings)

10:44.778 --> 10:46.747
(chimes)

10:46.780 --> 10:48.849
GUESS WHAT.
I HAVE A NICKNAME.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.418
MEDUSA.
I'M MEDUSA GREY.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.820
I HAD TO PUSH
MY FLIGHT TONIGHT.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.955
OH.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.457
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
IT'S NOT LIKE LAST TIME

10:57.490 --> 10:59.927
or the time before that.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.695
My surgery got pushed.
That's it.

11:01.729 --> 11:02.996
I'm on standby
for a later flight.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.065
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE
NOT READY TO FLY.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.734
I SAID I'D COME.
I'LL BE THERE.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.135
Well, you won't make it
by 5:00 anyway,

11:08.168 --> 11:09.770
so why push yourself?

11:09.803 --> 11:11.772
I WILL BE THERE, MEDUSA.

11:11.805 --> 11:12.873
OH, SO YOU DID HEAR ME?

11:12.906 --> 11:14.742
I like it.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.209
Snakes in the hair--hot!

11:16.243 --> 11:17.711
(elevator bell dings)

11:17.745 --> 11:18.846
Okay, bye.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.014
CRISTINA'S COMING TONIGHT?

11:21.048 --> 11:22.449
SHE'LL NEVER MAKE IT BY 5:00,

11:22.482 --> 11:23.851
BUT SHE SAYS
SHE'S GONNA BE HERE.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.485
HUH.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.755
(clicks keyboard keys)

11:27.788 --> 11:29.723
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET
ON THAT PLANE, IS SHE?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.860
WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.795
(sighs)

11:34.828 --> 11:35.863
PROBABLY NOT.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.130
(chuckles)

11:37.164 --> 11:40.133
(The Mynabirds' "Body of Work"
playing)

11:40.167 --> 11:41.869
(indistinct conversations)

11:41.902 --> 11:45.005
* BEFORE YOU GET OUT
I WANT YOU TO KNOW *

11:45.038 --> 11:47.007
YOU REALLY DOING
THE INTERN APPY?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.141
JEALOUS?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.409
HE'S TOO BUSY
JUST DOING THE INTERNS.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.879
ARE YOU GONNA SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR FAN CLUB BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.046
I'VE BEEN SAYING GOOD-BYE
ALL DAY.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.181
(laughs)

11:54.214 --> 11:55.482
GROSS.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.616
THEY'RE GONNA BE SAD
TO SEE ME GO.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.986
YOU MAY HAVE TO STEP UP,
AVERY. COMFORT THEM A LITTLE.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.088
NO SLOPPY SECONDS FOR ME,
THANK YOU.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.522
YOU'RE A SURGICAL FELLOW.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.824
MIGHT AS WELL
ENJOY THE PERKS.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.092
BESIDES,
YOU NEED TO GET LAID.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.227
YOU HAVEN'T BANGED ANYBODY
SINCE LEXIE.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.763
* AND YOU WILL

12:09.797 --> 12:10.898
(cash register beeps
and clicks)

12:10.931 --> 12:12.032
* BEFORE YOU GET OUT

12:12.065 --> 12:13.967
SORRY, MER.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.169
I-I HAVE...

12:16.203 --> 12:18.171
BANGED PEOPLE.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.773
(woman) I'M SCREWED.

12:19.807 --> 12:20.774
AS LONG AS MEDUSA'S
MY ATTENDING,

12:20.808 --> 12:23.310
I WILL NEVER GET TO SEE
THE INSIDE OF AN O.R.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.778
UNLESS YOU'RE THE PATIENT.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.846
(crunches) OH. (chuckles)

12:25.879 --> 12:27.547
DON'T BE ALARMED,
BUT MEDUSA'S WALKING OVER HERE.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.182
DEPENDING ON HER MOOD,
I MAY HAVE TO PRETEND

12:29.216 --> 12:30.550
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.785
(Meredith)
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.854
AS YOU ALL PROBABLY ALREADY
KNOW, WE HAVE A TRADITION HERE.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.989
THE HONOR OF PERFORMING
YOUR FIRST SURGERY

12:36.023 --> 12:39.059
IS RESERVED FOR THE INTERN
WHO SHOWS THE MOST PROMISE.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.295
***

12:42.329 --> 12:43.797
DR. WILSON.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.597
(sputters and coughs)

12:44.631 --> 12:46.967
CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU'RE SCRUBBING IN.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.803
* FREEDOM IS WHAT YOU DO
WITH WHAT *

12:49.837 --> 12:51.905
YOU GOT SODA
COMING OUT YOUR NOSE.

12:51.939 --> 12:52.940
* DONE TO YOU

12:52.973 --> 12:55.342
* WITH WHAT'S BEEN DONE
TO YOU *

12:55.375 --> 12:56.844
(beeping)

12:56.877 --> 12:58.946
HE HAS AN UNSTABLE FRACTURE.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.549
I NEED TO DO A FUSE IN HERE
AND HE--

13:02.582 --> 13:04.351
ANY NUMBNESS

13:04.384 --> 13:06.954
OR TINGLING AROUND
THE MEDIAN NERVE?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.956
NOT--
I'M GOOD TO GO, TORRES.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.090
YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.992
AND YOU'LL NEED
YOUR I.D. CARD

13:12.025 --> 13:13.827
TO ACCESS THE SCAN ROOMS.

13:13.861 --> 13:14.828
HEY.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.163
(Callie) HEY.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.898
UH, THIS IS MEL BARNETT.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.867
HE'LL BE JOINING US
FROM MIAMI.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.835
PEDS SURGERY.
I'M THE NEW ATTENDING.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.104
AND YOU ARE?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.372
I'M DEREK SHEPHERD,
UH, NEURO.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.240
NICE MEETING YOU.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.909
CALLIE TORRES, ORTHO.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.610
OH, RIGHT.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.313
UH, I AM SO SORRY,

13:33.346 --> 13:35.582
UH, ABOUT YOUR WIFE.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.017
I MEAN, I HEARD, AND, UH--

13:37.050 --> 13:38.585
THANK YOU.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.153
(Owen) OKAY, UH...

13:40.187 --> 13:41.922
HOW ABOUT I SHOW YOU
THE NICU?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.023
YEAH.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.391
(sighs)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.426
LET'S NOT MAKE
A BIG DEAL.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.634
(crying)

13:54.667 --> 13:57.905
(laughter)

14:00.107 --> 14:02.175
LISTEN...

14:02.209 --> 14:03.977
I WISH I COULD PUT THEM OFF
SO YOU AND I COULD

14:04.011 --> 14:05.245
SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER,

14:05.278 --> 14:08.048
BUT I ALREADY
POSTPONED HOPKINS ONCE.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.983
(continues crying)

14:10.017 --> 14:11.952
OH, MY GOD.

14:11.985 --> 14:12.986
JUST GO--GET OUTI'M SORRY.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.890
CALLIE?

14:16.924 --> 14:18.091
I SAID GET OUT.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.226
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:19.259 --> 14:20.660
GET OUT, OKAY?
GET OUT.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.062
GET OUT.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.936
(sobs)

14:34.441 --> 14:37.444
(crying)

14:45.485 --> 14:46.920
(clicks)

14:46.954 --> 14:48.155
(Mark) YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME
FOR THIS, AVERY,

14:48.188 --> 14:49.389
WHEN YOU'VE REWATCHED IT
FOR THE 500th TIME

14:49.422 --> 14:51.024
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO LINE UP

14:51.058 --> 14:53.260
YOUR VERTICAL MATTRESS SUTURES
AS PERFECTLY AS I CAN.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.661
NOW PAN UP TO MY FACE.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.663
YOU SEE THAT?
NOT A DROP OF SWEAT.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.665
YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I'M THAT GOOD.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.034
NOW GO GET SCRUBBED.
YOU'RE GONNA FINISH UP HERE.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.103
(Jackson) WAIT. REALLY?

15:03.136 --> 15:05.372
HURRY.
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.673
(chart clatters)

15:06.706 --> 15:07.407
(pages rustle)

15:07.440 --> 15:09.242
AND I FINISHED
THE RECONSTRUCTION

15:09.276 --> 15:11.444
WE TALKED ABOUT ON
THE YOUNG MASTECTOMY PATIENT,

15:11.478 --> 15:13.213
UH, AND THE RESULT
IS FULL SLOAN.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.481
I MEAN, SHE IS GONNA LOOK

15:14.514 --> 15:17.050
A SCALE HOTTER
THAN GOD INTENDED.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.220
UH, AND GRANDPA'S LABS
CAME BACK.

15:20.253 --> 15:24.291
STABLE. UM, SCARRING IS GONNA
BE A PROBLEM, OBVIOUSLY.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.493
BUT THE RESULT
IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING.

15:26.526 --> 15:29.362
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

15:29.396 --> 15:31.364
AND YOU THINK
WE CAN DO BETTER.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.133
I DON'T KNOW. RECONSTRUCTION?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.135
THAT'S PRETTY RADICAL
FOR A GUY HIS AGE.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.470
(beeping continues)

15:37.504 --> 15:39.372
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.074
WE CAN DO BETTER.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.409
(beeping continues)

15:42.442 --> 15:44.211
(tablet alert chimes)

15:44.244 --> 15:47.714
(Cristina) HEY, I WISH YOU COULD
SEE THE SURGERY I'M WATCHING.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.149
IT IS A TRAIN WRECK.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.118
So you're not gonna make it
by 5:00.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.385
Do you want

15:52.419 --> 15:54.221
TO FaceTime OR SKYPE
OR SOMETHING?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.156
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD THAT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HERE.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.424
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.393
HE TURNED A PORT-CABG
Why? A STERNOTOMY.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.996
WHY? BECAUSE THIS SURGEON
IS 103.

16:03.030 --> 16:05.098
BECAUSE EVERYONE IN THIS
FROZEN TUNDRA

16:05.132 --> 16:06.733
IS TOO DAMN POLITE TO SAY,

16:06.766 --> 16:07.867
"HEY, RETIRE, OLD MAN,

16:07.900 --> 16:11.204
BEFORE YOU KILL SOMEONE
WITH YOUR BRITTLE, BONY HANDS."

16:11.238 --> 16:13.340
I'M SORRY. WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING THAT OUTSIDE?

16:13.373 --> 16:14.741
I'M TRYING TO TAKE NOTES.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.176
YEAH, WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO LEARN HERE.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.410
HE'S JUST POKING HOLES

16:17.444 --> 16:19.112
in a guy's pericardium.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.547
HE'LL NEVER COME OFF BYPASS.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.748
I just wish

16:21.781 --> 16:23.250
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.351
Owen e-mailed me today,

16:24.384 --> 16:27.220
WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I HAD PEOPLE AROUND ME TONIGHT.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.190
I don't know why everyone

16:31.491 --> 16:33.360

17:14.201 --> 17:15.435
(laughs) ONLY YOU

17:15.468 --> 17:17.804
CAN MAKE A SMALL HEMATOMA
SOUND SEXY.

17:17.837 --> 17:20.407
CRAZY. AHH.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.275
* I DON'T NEED TO CROSS

17:46.133 --> 17:48.101
ALEX KAREV. RIGHT.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.303
UH, HUNT MENTIONED THAT
ROBBINS REALLY LIKED YOU.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.372
MEL BARNETT.
HERE FROM MIAMI.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.840
OH, THE NEW PEDS GUY.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.275
YOU'RE HEADED TO?

17:55.308 --> 17:56.643
UH, HOPKINS, FELLOWSHIP.
LEAVING TONIGHT.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.311
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.846
(elevator bell dings)

17:59.879 --> 18:01.648
SO IS THIS, BY THE WAY.
HUNT'S BEEN FILLING ME IN.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.151
OH, DID HE, UH, TELL YOU ABOUT
OUR EXCHANGE PROGRAM YET?

18:04.184 --> 18:06.653
WE BROUGHT OVER 32 KIDS
FROM 5 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

18:06.686 --> 18:07.520
IN AFRICA.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.656
HUNT DID MENTION THE PROGRAM,
DR. KAREV.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.858
ADMIRABLE WORK,
BUT I'M AFRAID

18:11.891 --> 18:13.560
IT DOESN'T
FIT WITH MY AGENDA.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.328
WE OPERATE ON SICK ORPHANS.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.863
HOW DOES THAT NOT FIT
YOUR AGENDA?

18:16.896 --> 18:20.200
NOT TO WORRY. I'VE ALREADY
REACHED OUT TO U.C.L.A.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.334
(cell phone ringing)

18:21.368 --> 18:22.635
THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE,
JUST...

18:22.669 --> 18:23.736
NOT HERE.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.139
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M TRYING
TO CLOSE ON A HOUSE.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.675
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:28.708 --> 18:30.543
(door hisses open)

18:30.577 --> 18:32.879
(surgical staff
speaking indistinctly)

18:32.912 --> 18:34.647
(woman) WELCOME BACK.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.451
TORRES.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.687
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.689
OKAY. I HAD A LITTLE
TO DO WITH THIS.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.691
WELL, THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.427
IT'S REALLY NO BIG DEAL.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.229
(woman speaks indistinctly)

18:49.262 --> 18:52.632
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:52.665 --> 18:54.201
WHAT?

18:54.234 --> 18:55.902
YOU HAVE TO SAY IT.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.737
(chuckles)

18:59.439 --> 19:00.673
(exhales)

19:00.707 --> 19:02.509
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
TO SAVE LIVES.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.344
(surgical staff chuckles
and speaks indistinctly)

19:06.346 --> 19:07.447
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE PULLS THIS OFF.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.216
SHE MIGHT, AS LONG AS SHE
DOESN'T LOOK UP AT MEDUSA

19:09.249 --> 19:10.350
DURING THE SURGERY.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.219
YEAH, THAT FACE
WILL CALCIFY HER.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.321
(chuckles) DO YOU THINK
MEDUSA'S ALWAYS BEEN MEDUSA?

19:14.354 --> 19:17.357
(Shane) Probably. I heard
her mom was even worse.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.691
Yeah, but...

19:18.725 --> 19:20.427
that doesn't give her an excuse
to act like a demon

19:20.460 --> 19:22.195
from the depths of hell
itself.

19:22.229 --> 19:24.697
(interns laugh)

19:24.731 --> 19:26.333
IT'S LIKE SHE CAN HEAR US.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.967
YEAH,
THAT LITTLE RED LIGHT...

19:28.000 --> 19:29.302
(gasps)

19:29.336 --> 19:30.603
MEANS THE INTERCOM
IS ON.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.939
(woman) OHH. OH.

19:32.972 --> 19:35.508
Now sit up straight.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.710
I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU'RE A DEMON.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.712
FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.648
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

19:41.681 --> 19:43.750
(suction gurgling)

19:43.783 --> 19:44.751
THERE IT IS.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.219
HUH.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.354
LOOK AT THAT.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.955
(chuckles)
GOD, I NEEDED THIS.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.390
IT FEELS SO GOOD
TO FINALLY HAVE MY HANDS

19:50.423 --> 19:52.225
ON A PROBLEM I CAN FIX.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.493
(chuckles)

19:53.526 --> 19:55.295
(instrument clatters)

19:55.328 --> 19:58.798
(surgical staff
speaking indistinctly)

20:03.703 --> 20:05.438
NELSON IS ON STANDBY.
LET'S HAVE HIM COME FINISH.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.539
DEREK, JUST TAKE A SECOND.
JUST--

20:06.573 --> 20:08.808
I'LL MEET YOU IN POST-OP.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.718
(clicks)

20:18.751 --> 20:20.019
I HAD A PATIENT ONCE

20:20.052 --> 20:20.953
WHO TOLD ME ABOUT
HIS WEDDING DAY

20:20.987 --> 20:22.789
AND HOW THEY ASKED
ALL THE MARRIED COUPLES

20:22.822 --> 20:24.791
TO COME TO THE DANCE FLOOR
TO DANCE TOGETHER.

20:24.824 --> 20:27.360
AND THEN THEY ASKED
THE COUPLES

20:27.394 --> 20:29.762
WHO'D BEEN ONLY MARRIED
A YEAR TO SIT DOWN.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.631
AND THEN FIVE YEARS,
THEN TEN YEARS,

20:31.664 --> 20:33.766
20, AND SO ON,

20:33.800 --> 20:38.037
UNTIL THEY GOT TO
THE LAST TWO COUPLES.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.040
UH, TWO SETS
OF GRANDPARENTS.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.809

20:42.842 --> 20:47.314

21:08.401 --> 21:09.836

21:09.869 --> 21:12.071
OH, WELL, THAT'S EASY.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.066
SOMETIMES THINGS DIE, ALEX,

22:29.682 --> 22:31.851
* STANDING THERE TELL ME WHY
I SHOULD TRY *

22:31.884 --> 22:35.422
I KNOW WHY YOU FAVOR
A LESS-INVASIVE APPROACH.

22:35.455 --> 22:38.791
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
A CREATURE OF YOUR GENERATION.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.927
I MEAN, YOU BELIEVE IN
30-SECOND RICE

OKAY, WELL, AS I SAID,

22:55.675 --> 22:57.176
I WILL OPEN HIM UP,
BUT HE'S A BABY,

22:57.209 --> 22:59.946
SO THERE'S ONLY ROOM
FOR ONE HEADLIGHT.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.583
SO YOU UNDERSTAND?
ONE HEADLIGHT, ONE SURGEON.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.884
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.153
AND YOU OWE ME ONE,

23:07.186 --> 23:10.457
BECAUSE I'M GIVING

MY ORIGINAL PLAN, FINE.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.668
YOU WANT TO BACKSEAT DRIVE,

YOU'RE THE ATTENDING.
I'M THE FELLOW.

23:22.869 --> 23:23.970
I'LL RESPECT THAT.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.972
BUT YOU'RE NOT STEALING
MY SURGERY.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.774
YOU'RE WELCOME TO ASSIST,
TO OBSERVE,

23:27.807 --> 23:28.941
TO YAMMER ABOUT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS,

23:28.975 --> 23:30.810
BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.945
THIS IS MY PATIENT,
MY PROCEDURE.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.715
* Y-Y, MY OH MY-Y

23:35.748 --> 23:38.184

23:47.259 --> 23:49.596
(sighs) WE--WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
TRIED THE SURGERY TODAY, OKAY?

23:49.629 --> 23:50.897
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.932
BEING IN THE O.R.,
THINKINTORRES--MARK--

23:52.965 --> 23:54.934
NO, LOOK, I SHOULDN'T HAVE

23:54.967 --> 23:56.636
LOOK AT US. WE'RE EMOTIONAL.
IT WAS JUST--IT WAS BAD--

23:56.669 --> 23:58.805
MY HAND WENT NUMB
IN THERE.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.478
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:07.847 --> 24:10.483
IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.851
(door closes)

24:11.884 --> 24:13.920
(sighs)

24:13.953 --> 24:15.922
SO I DISCHARGED
OUR CLEFT BABY.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.924
HE'LL BE BACK
IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

24:17.957 --> 24:22.529
OH, AND I...

24:22.562 --> 24:26.766
I DECIDED AGAINST
RECONSTRUCTION... FOR GRANDPA.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.235
I KNOW IT'S NOT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT, BUT...

24:29.268 --> 24:31.671
AND DON'T TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY, ALL RIGHT?

24:31.704 --> 24:34.541
BECAUSE...

24:34.574 --> 24:36.976
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME A LOT.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.946
BUT I THINK, UM...

24:39.979 --> 24:42.549
I REALLY KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

24:42.582 --> 24:44.951
SO...

24:44.984 --> 24:47.920
I'M GOOD.

24:47.954 --> 24:51.290
THE PLASTICS POSSE'S...
(sniffles) GONNA LIVE ON...

24:51.323 --> 24:53.893
(ventilator clicking)

24:53.926 --> 24:56.629
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:56.663 --> 24:58.931
BECAUSE, UH...

24:58.965 --> 25:01.734
BECAUSE I CAN TAKE IT
FROM HERE.

25:01.768 --> 25:05.572

OKAY, WE'RE ALL DOCTORS HERE.
YOU DON'T NEED TO SAY THIS.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.031
I'M NOT SAYING IT BECAUSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PROCEDURE.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.733
***

25:33.766 --> 25:36.068
I SAY IT BECAUSE EVEN IF
YOU THINK YOU'RE PREPARED

25:36.102 --> 25:38.104
FOR WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN,

25:38.137 --> 25:39.672
YOU'RE NOT.

YOUR BRAIN CAN'T FULLY ABSORB
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO DO.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.079
BUT BY SAYING THIS...

25:47.113 --> 25:50.983
I'M GIVING YOU
A LITTLE TIME TO CATCH UP.

25:51.017 --> 25:54.020

IF LIFE-SUSTAINING PROCEDURES

26:16.075 --> 26:18.845
WOULD ONLY PROLONG
THE MOMENT OF DEATH,

26:18.878 --> 26:23.049
THAT THESE PROCEDURES
BE DISCONTINUED.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.352
SOMEWHERE TO BE,
DR. YANG?

26:26.385 --> 26:29.021
NO. IT'S...

26:29.055 --> 26:31.724
IT'S 5:00 IN SEATTLE.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.093

26:40.399 --> 26:42.802
* WHERE THIS TIME

26:42.835 --> 26:44.804
DR. SLOAN ASKED THAT IF
HE WERE UNABLE TO MAKE

26:44.837 --> 26:46.939
HIS OWN MEDICAL DECISIONS,

26:46.973 --> 26:50.910

ONLY COMFORT CARE

IN HIS FINAL MOMENTS.

27:04.223 --> 27:07.159

27:07.193 --> 27:09.195

FOR A FEW MINUTES...

27:14.233 --> 27:16.202

27:28.981 --> 27:30.449
WE'VE SEDATED HIM
WITH MORPHINE

27:30.482 --> 27:34.420
SO HE'S NOT FEELING
ANY OF THIS.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.855

28:39.118 --> 28:41.053
WE TRIED SO HARD...

28:41.087 --> 28:44.891
OUT THERE IN THE WOODS.

28:44.924 --> 28:48.294
WE THOUGHT IF WE COULD JUST
GET HIM BACK HERE ALIVE...

29:06.178 --> 29:08.147
I-I CAN'T STAY HERE.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.083
I'M--I'M--TELL DEREK THAT
I WAS HERE AND I HAD TO GO.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.919
I AM, UH...

29:12.952 --> 29:16.789
I'M GOING TO THE AIRPORT.
I'M GONNA GO SEE CRISTINA.

29:16.823 --> 29:18.124
OKAY.

29:21.928 --> 29:24.096
(sniffles)

29:29.235 --> 29:30.937
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:30.970 --> 29:31.871
CHIEF, SORRY.

29:31.904 --> 29:35.908
I WAS JUST GOING
SOMEWHERE ELSE, ACTUALLY.

29:35.942 --> 29:41.080
THAT SURGERY WAS DESIGNED
FOR YOU TO FAIL.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.049
THE INTERN APPY--

29:43.082 --> 29:45.084
IT SETS YOU AS THE EXAMPLE.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.318
OKAY?

29:46.352 --> 29:48.154
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.322
WHY IS SHE SO MEAN?

29:50.356 --> 29:52.825
SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO TEACH YOU.

29:52.859 --> 29:54.093
(huffs)

29:54.126 --> 29:56.162
NO, WHY IS SHE SO MEAN?

29:56.195 --> 29:58.164
IS IT THAT PLANE CRASH?

29:58.197 --> 29:59.265
WHAT?

30:01.901 --> 30:03.235
I HEARD SHE WAS
IN A PLANE CRASH

30:03.269 --> 30:05.237
WITH SOME OTHER DOCTORS.

30:05.271 --> 30:09.108
THEY WERE STRANDED IN THE WOODS
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.243
PEOPLE DIED OR ALMOST DIED
OR SOMETHING.

30:11.277 --> 30:15.214
YEAH, YEAH, PEOPLE DIED
OR ALMOST DIED OR...

30:15.247 --> 30:17.249
SOMETHING.

30:21.921 --> 30:25.925
DR. GREY ISN'T MEAN.
SHE IS STRONG.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.360
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA GO EASY
ON YOU BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT

30:28.394 --> 30:30.629
THAT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE
TO YOU.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.231
YOU ARE A SURGEON.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.266
IT IS YOUR JOB TO FIX THINGS
OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.268
NOW IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THAT,
LEAVE NOW.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.037
IF NOT...

30:38.070 --> 30:41.007
DON'T STAND AROUND
IN HALLWAYS AND CRY.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.409
CRY SOMEWHERE ELSE,

30:43.442 --> 30:46.078
WHERE I WON'T SEE YOU.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.254
(Parker) YEAH, COME ON IN.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.356
DR. CRISTINA YANG

30:57.389 --> 31:00.893
OF SEATTLE FAME,
FORMERLY OF CALIFORNIA.

31:00.927 --> 31:02.895
SIT.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.966
HOW'D IT GO
WITH DR. THOMAS?

31:06.999 --> 31:09.268
UH, WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO, UH,

31:09.301 --> 31:10.903
TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM,

31:10.937 --> 31:12.905
UH, BUT I'D APPRECIATE
IF YOU STEERED HIM

31:12.939 --> 31:14.440
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S DIRECTION.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.442
MM.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.911
I'M NOT SURE
THAT'S GONNA WORK.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.313
SEE, I'VE ASKED HIM
TO HELP YOU OUT,

31:21.347 --> 31:23.950
NAVIGATING THE WATERS
AND ALL.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.384
I FOUND THE CAFETERIA.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.319
(chuckles)

31:27.353 --> 31:30.656
YEAH, IT'S...
MORE THAN THAT.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.325
MY WORK HAS BEEN IMPECCABLE.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.261
MY RECORD HERE IS PERFECT.

31:35.294 --> 31:36.162
MM-HMM.

31:36.195 --> 31:39.331
IF ALL YOU LOOK AT
IS OUTCOMES, MAYBE.

31:39.365 --> 31:42.301
BUT ON OUR YARDSTICK,

31:42.334 --> 31:44.203
YOU DON'T
SEEM TO BE THRIVING.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.205
I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

31:46.238 --> 31:50.009
BUT THE FACT IS,
WE WORK AS A TEAM HERE.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.044
NO ONE HERE
IS A SUPERSTAR.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.146
OUR HOSPITAL
IS THE SUPERSTAR.

31:54.180 --> 31:55.281
AND OUR PATIENTS...

31:55.314 --> 31:57.249
(chuckles)
THEY'RE SUPERSTARS.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.718
WE PRIDE OURSELVES
ON THAT.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.255
NO EGO,
NO PROPRIETARY ATTITUDES,

32:03.289 --> 32:05.357
NO COMPETITION.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.959
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

32:06.993 --> 32:08.961
WE'RE SENSITIVE
TO ALL YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.163
IF YOU WANT TO TALK
TO SOMEONE,

32:11.197 --> 32:12.398
I'M HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU NAMES.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.166
DR. PARKER, THAT WON'T--

32:14.200 --> 32:16.368
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A FEW DAYS...

32:16.402 --> 32:18.337
SEE THE LAKES,

32:18.370 --> 32:20.239
CHECK OUT
THE MALL OF AMERICA?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.207
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY SAYS

32:21.240 --> 32:23.109
THEY RIDE THE ROLLER COASTER
FOR THEIR KIDS,

32:23.142 --> 32:25.511
BUT THE ADULTS
EAT IT UP.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.346
GO GET SOME R&R.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.348
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

32:29.381 --> 32:33.052
SOFTEN UP THOSE SHARP
SEATTLE EDGES.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.187
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.157
I'M SORRY. IS THIS R&R
A SUGGESTION OR--

32:38.190 --> 32:39.992
IT'S MANDATORY, YANG,

32:40.026 --> 32:41.994
STARTING NOW.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.332
(people speaking indistinctly)

32:46.365 --> 32:47.366
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:47.399 --> 32:49.301
ANYTHING?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.403
(Jackson) NO, NOT YET.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.407
(woman) HERE YOU GO,
DOCTOR.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.443
THANK YOU.

33:14.460 --> 33:20.299
D-DOES MY NICKNAME
COMMAND RESPECT?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.101
NO.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.103
STRIKE FEAR IN THE HEARTS
OF RESIDENTS?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.171
NO.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.538
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

33:29.075 --> 33:30.442
MM.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.313
(clears throat)

33:34.346 --> 33:37.449
YOU'VE BEEN... HAPPY.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.452
AND THE INTERNS NOTICED
THAT YOUR HAPPINESS

33:40.486 --> 33:43.189
OFTEN COINCIDES

33:43.222 --> 33:45.457
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF--
OF DR. WARREN.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.326
AND THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.096
OH, OH, COME ON NOW.
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.230
NO, I CAN'T.
I AM A GENTLEMAN.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.365
AND ALSO, I DON'T WANNA.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.467
(chuckles)

33:55.501 --> 33:56.302
(Jackson clears throat)

33:56.335 --> 33:59.105
(Miranda) WH--WH--UH...
OH, COME...

33:59.138 --> 34:01.373
OKAY, I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS
BECAUSE I'M LITERALLY

34:01.407 --> 34:03.475
ABOUT TO WALK OUT
OF THIS HOSPITAL FOREVER.

34:03.509 --> 34:04.543
(Richard, muffled voice)
MNH-MNH. KAREV. KAREV.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.378
YOUR NICKNAME'S B.C.B.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.456
THANK YOU.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.558
GOOD-BYE, DR. BAILEY.

34:19.591 --> 34:22.294
YEAH. BYE, KAREV.

34:22.328 --> 34:24.496

34:27.299 --> 34:30.302
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

34:38.510 --> 34:40.446
HEY. SO THAT'S IT?

34:40.479 --> 34:42.181
I'M NOT EVEN AS GOOD AS ONE OF
YOUR INTERN GIRLS, HUH?

34:42.214 --> 34:43.415
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME?

34:43.449 --> 34:45.451
MER, WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

34:45.484 --> 34:46.452
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.653
DON'T MAKE THIS A THING.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.221
DON'T MAKE THIS A THING?

34:49.255 --> 34:50.456
MARK IS DYING RIGHT NOW.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.624
AND THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE, TOO?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.460
I'M JUST--I'M GONNA BE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.262
IT'S, UH, WE'LL TALK.
IT'S NOT LIKE--

34:56.295 --> 34:57.496
THAT'S WHAT CRISTINA SAID.
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.131
NOTHING IS THE SAME.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.065
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.268
EVERYONE'S LEAVING
AND EVERYONE IS DYING.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.535
DON'T MAKE THIS MY PROBLEM.

35:03.569 --> 35:05.404
I'M FINALLY GETTING
THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.273
I CAN'T KEEP STANDING AROUND
BEING THE GUY

35:07.306 --> 35:09.175
WHO SHOULD'VE BEEN
ON THE PLANE THAT CRASHED.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.876
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE, MER.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.678
I... I SHOULD'VE LEFT
THIS FREAKIN' PLACE

35:12.711 --> 35:14.413
THREE MONTHS AGO.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.282
GET OFF.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.416
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA STAY
IN SEATTLE

35:17.449 --> 35:19.518
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.454
LOOK,
HOPKINS WON'T WAIT FOREVER.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.423
I GOT A PLANE TO CATCH,
SO BYE.

35:24.456 --> 35:28.327

35:45.644 --> 35:47.713

ON THE WALL *

36:02.494 --> 36:04.596

36:04.630 --> 36:06.632
(sighs)

36:07.966 --> 36:09.935
* WE CAN'T BE SAVED

36:09.968 --> 36:14.340

36:17.976 --> 36:22.248

TO BE *

36:22.281 --> 36:23.349

36:23.382 --> 36:28.420
* HOW'S MY HEART
SUPPOSED TO BE *

36:28.454 --> 36:31.957
* HOW'S MY HEART SUPPOSED
TO BE *

36:31.990 --> 36:35.761
* WITHOUT YOU?

36:35.794 --> 36:39.197
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

36:58.650 --> 37:01.387
* OH, OOH OOH

37:01.420 --> 37:03.689

37:05.023 --> 37:06.392

37:06.425 --> 37:08.260
(sighs)

37:08.294 --> 37:11.297

SHH.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.781

SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.325
(jet engines roar)

37:39.358 --> 37:40.492
(intercom alert chimes)

37:40.526 --> 37:42.428
(man) ON BEHALF OF THE CAPTAIN
AND OUR ENTIRE CREW,

37:42.461 --> 37:44.062

37:45.597 --> 37:47.399
(voice distorts)
TO ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.767

37:52.103 --> 37:53.305
THIS AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED
WITH SEVERAL...

37:53.339 --> 37:54.640

37:54.673 --> 37:56.675
(clatter)

37:56.708 --> 37:58.677
(whispers) I HAVE TO GO.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.645
IN THE EVENT OF
AN EMERGENCY LANDING...

37:59.678 --> 38:02.414
(whispers) I HAVE TO GET UP.
I HAVE TO GO.

38:02.448 --> 38:04.082
FIND THE NEAREST EXIT...

38:04.115 --> 38:04.916
I HAVE TO GO.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.051
IN THE EVENT
OF AN EMERGENCY...

38:06.084 --> 38:08.454
I'M SORRY, MISS. IF YOU COULD
PLEASE STAY IN YOUR SEAT--

38:08.487 --> 38:10.656
YOU NEED TO RETURN
NO,TO YOUR SEAT.AVE.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.458
NO, NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE HEARING ME.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.526
I'M SORRY. WE'RE ABOUT
I NETO CLOSE THE DOORS--ANE.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.861
OPEN THE DOOR, OR I'LL PULL

38:15.894 --> 38:17.329
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.
OPEN THAT DAMN DOOR...

38:17.363 --> 38:18.597
AND LET ME THE HELL
OFF THIS PLANE!

38:18.630 --> 38:19.731
I NEED YOU TO CALM--

38:19.765 --> 38:21.633
LET ME OFF THE PLANE!

38:21.667 --> 38:23.702
(speaks inaudibly)

38:23.735 --> 38:28.073
(Meredith) THEY SAY DEATH
IS HARDEST ON THE LIVING.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.508
I HAD THE BOARDING PASS
IN MY HAND.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.776
I WAS...

38:30.809 --> 38:32.378
(sighs deeply)

38:32.411 --> 38:33.879
STANDING THERE
WATCHING THEM BOARD THE PLANE,

38:33.912 --> 38:37.849
BUT I... COULDN'T MOVE.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.851
NEXT TIME.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.387
We have to get past this.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.655
I KNOW.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.491
What are you doing here?

38:45.524 --> 38:48.360
HEY, WHO IS THAT?
POINT ME.

38:48.394 --> 38:51.397
I'm sorry about before.

38:51.430 --> 38:52.764
You should be.

38:52.798 --> 38:53.899
(people speaking indistinctly)

38:53.932 --> 38:55.367
I'M SORRY, TOO.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.902
I thought you said
he was leaving.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.370
I thought
you said you were leaving.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.638
The guy replacing Robbins

38:59.671 --> 39:00.906
is just gonna
mess the place up.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.642
Besides, I don't even
like Baltimore.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.843
So what are you saying?

39:04.876 --> 39:06.545
I couldn't get
on my plane, okay?

39:06.578 --> 39:07.913
I COULDN'T GO.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.581
YOU'RE SAYING YOU DITCHED
THE FLIGHT

39:09.615 --> 39:11.883
'CAUSE YOU CHICKENED OUT.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.485
WHAT A LOSER.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.788
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

39:16.822 --> 39:18.390
When Hunt lands,

39:18.424 --> 39:19.791
tell him I'm staying.

39:19.825 --> 39:20.926
(gulps)

39:20.959 --> 39:22.394
What?

39:22.428 --> 39:23.529
I just saw him here
at the airport.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.497
Isn't he coming
to see you?

39:25.531 --> 39:29.134
IT'S TOUGH
TO ACTUALLY SAY GOOD-BYE.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.902
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.704
(grunting)AX. SLOP TIME.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.840
JUST ABOUT
TO GET YOU OVER THERE.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.776
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET--

39:37.809 --> 39:38.877
DR. HUNT?

39:38.910 --> 39:41.413
HEY. UH, YOUR DAD TOLD ME
WHERE I COULD FIND YOU.

39:41.447 --> 39:43.949
WHAT ARE--WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

39:43.982 --> 39:46.685
MARK SLOAN DIED YESTERDAY.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.588
OH, GOD.
UM... I'M SO SORRY.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.990
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK
AND WORK AT THE HOSPITAL.

39:53.459 --> 39:54.560
WHAT?

39:54.593 --> 39:55.694
(sighs)

39:55.727 --> 39:57.963
NOTHING IS THE SAME
OVER THERE.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.932
IT'S ALL...

40:00.966 --> 40:03.635
I KEEP TRYING...

40:03.669 --> 40:04.903
I KEEP TRYING
TO THINK OF WAYS

40:04.936 --> 40:06.171
I COULD'VE
DONE THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

40:06.204 --> 40:07.773
AND, UH...

40:07.806 --> 40:09.875
IF I'D REALIZED
THEY WERE MISSING SOONER,

40:09.908 --> 40:12.210
IF I'D TOLD CRISTINA
HOW MUCH I...

40:12.243 --> 40:13.812
I KEEP LOOKING
FOR THE DO-OVERS,

40:13.845 --> 40:16.482
AND THERE'S NO DO-OVERS.

40:16.515 --> 40:18.183
THERE'S JUST THE WAY IT IS,

40:18.216 --> 40:19.985
AND I CAN'T FIX THAT,

40:20.018 --> 40:22.588
EXCEPT FOR THIS,
FOWH--U.

40:22.621 --> 40:23.955
I DIDN'T TEACH YOU,
NOT THE WAY THAT I SHOULD HAVE.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.457
I-I SHOULD'VE HELPED YOU
BE STRONG

40:25.491 --> 40:27.726
INSTEAD OF KICKING YOU
WHEN YOU WERE DOWN.

40:27.759 --> 40:31.697
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN
YOUR JOB FROM YOU.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.600
YOU DON'T BELONG OUT HERE
ON A... (chuckles)

40:34.633 --> 40:36.001
A FARM.

40:36.034 --> 40:38.637
YOU BELONG IN SEATTLE,

40:38.670 --> 40:40.739
SAVING LIVES.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.508
NOW COME HOME.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.242
(woman) * ON THE FLOOR

40:44.275 --> 40:46.712
* NOTHING MORE

40:46.745 --> 40:48.947
* TO THIS ROOM

40:48.980 --> 40:50.982
* BUT A GIRL

40:51.016 --> 40:53.585
(sighs)

40:53.619 --> 40:56.588
UH, I CAN'T KEEP
DOING THIS ALONE, ARIZONA.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.023
I JUST CAN'T.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.024
* ...YOU

40:59.057 --> 41:01.627
* CAN WE BREAK DOWN

41:01.660 --> 41:03.695
GET UP.

41:03.729 --> 41:06.264
GET THE HELL OUT OF BED
AND SNAP OUT OF THIS...

41:06.297 --> 41:07.699
(voice breaking) IF NOT
FOR ME, THEN FOR SOFIA,

41:07.733 --> 41:09.835
BECAUSE SHE LOST A PARENT
LAST NIGHT.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.269
AND I LOST MY BEST FRIEND.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.738
AND I WILL BE DAMNED
IF I LOSE YOU, TOO.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.239
SNAP OUT OF THIS?

41:14.272 --> 41:16.608
SNAP OUT OF THIS?

41:16.642 --> 41:18.577
* I CAN FIGHT

41:18.610 --> 41:20.045
* I CAN PULL

41:20.078 --> 41:21.647
HOW THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO SNAP OUT OF THIS

41:21.680 --> 41:23.849
WHEN YOU CUT OFF MY LEG?

41:23.882 --> 41:25.984
* IF YOU SAY

41:26.017 --> 41:28.820
* I CAN LAY

41:28.854 --> 41:31.690
* RIGHT HERE

41:31.723 --> 41:33.258
* BY YOUR SIDE

41:33.291 --> 41:34.259
(slams)

41:34.292 --> 41:37.663
YOU NEVER REALLY STOP
FEELING THE LOSS.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.799
(Arizona) EVERYBODY...
CHEESE!

41:40.832 --> 41:43.034
(Callie and Mark) CHEESE.

41:43.068 --> 41:44.536
NOTHING'S HAPPENING.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.071
OH, COME ON.
I THINK IT'S ON VIDEO.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.706
SHOULD I GO OVER THERE?

41:47.739 --> 41:49.274
NO, JUST GIVE HER
A SECOND.

41:49.307 --> 41:50.709
WELL, NO, IT'S--I'M--
I'M PRESSING THE BUTTON.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.077
IT'S JUST--
IT'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

41:52.110 --> 41:53.545
WELL...

41:53.579 --> 41:54.680
MAYBE IT'S BROKE AND--

41:54.713 --> 41:55.814
I'M TAOH-- OVER.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.948
NO, NO, NO. OH, NO.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.083
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.
I DON'T NEED--

41:58.116 --> 41:59.818
WE HAVE A KID TOGETHER,
(groans)

41:59.851 --> 42:01.687
SO YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME
(Callie laughs)

42:01.720 --> 42:03.689
IT'S WHAT MAKES THINGS
SO BITTERSWEET.

42:03.722 --> 42:05.757
WE LEAVE LITTLE BITS
OF OURSELVES BEHIND...

42:05.791 --> 42:06.892
(laughs)

42:06.925 --> 42:08.293
LITTLE REMINDERS...

42:08.326 --> 42:10.796
A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES,

42:10.829 --> 42:13.031
PHOTOS, TRINKETS...

42:13.064 --> 42:14.299
HOH.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.767
I GOT IT.

42:15.801 --> 42:17.068
(camera shutter clicks)

42:17.102 --> 42:19.004
THINGS TO REMEMBER US BY

42:19.037 --> 42:20.706
EVEN WHEN WE'RE GONE.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.107
(clicks)

42:22.140 --> 42:32.183
