02:59.994 --> 03:03.413
Look! What is that?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.201
Mum, are you okay?

03:30.500 --> 03:33.433
Oh, I must have dozed off.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.300
- Anyone come in?
- It's been quiet.

03:39.750 --> 03:45.236
- I don't know how we make it.
- Daddy left us some money.

03:50.350 --> 03:52.427
Were you dreaming about daddy?

03:57.404 --> 04:00.100
I don't remember my dream.

05:25.602 --> 05:28.833
For those of you who just came to.

05:28.868 --> 05:33.219
Welcome to Doom Room,
boys and girls and...

05:33.320 --> 05:38.764
whatever else that is sitting out
there in the dark lying to themselves.

05:39.050 --> 05:44.000
Our matinee today is Top Notch,
Kabuki Skincrawl.

05:44.014 --> 05:50.465
But... I hasten to add that what
you will see here this afternoon,

05:50.469 --> 06:00.885
though shocking is not just some jaded
exhibition, but is based in science.

06:22.977 --> 06:25.402
- What do you want?
- What do you got?

06:25.415 --> 06:29.213
- What do you want?  Leave us alone.
- We can't do that.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.193
We are the youth of America,

06:31.194 --> 06:35.575
endeavoring against insurmountable
odds, to eke out a living.

06:35.865 --> 06:38.865
- My...!
- Just get on with it, okay!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.817
Which one of you guys is older?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.150
Hey, he asked you a
fucking question, Wrinkles!

06:46.180 --> 06:47.537
I'm older.

06:47.788 --> 06:50.585
Really?
That's nasty.

06:50.805 --> 06:52.842
You're a little liar, aren't you.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.099
Stay still.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.900
- What... what.  What do you?
- Hey, Wrinkle working here.

06:57.950 --> 07:01.028
This is our fucking office hours.
You wanna hold her down.

07:02.065 --> 07:05.028
Hey!  We are just
here for the red, Boxx!

07:05.165 --> 07:11.303
- Ay! Ay! Ay! Ay!
- We just here for the red. Just the red.

07:17.543 --> 07:19.400
It's gonna heal, okay.

07:28.923 --> 07:33.844
- I hope you animals die!
- Yeah.  That'll be nice.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.774
<i>The death toll in the US alone
from months of terrorist blitz attacks</i>

07:48.775 --> 07:51.124
<i>is now officially over 9 million.</i>

07:51.171 --> 07:53.967
<i>And 7 American cities,
including New York and</i>

07:53.980 --> 07:56.786
<i>Los Angeles remain
destroyed by the war.</i>

07:56.900 --> 08:01.600
<i>In local news, murder statistics in Muskee
have officials more concerned than ever.</i>

08:01.665 --> 08:05.899
<i>This week alone there have been
a reported 57 murders and 80 rapes.</i>

08:05.900 --> 08:08.165
<i>And chief of police
Harris advises citizens...</i>

08:08.166 --> 08:10.454
Should have burned it to the ground.

08:13.365 --> 08:17.420
Anyone stupid enough to go
there is asking for it.

08:19.383 --> 08:21.943
Tell me again how it was with daddy.

08:22.205 --> 08:24.210
You must be tired of that by now.

08:24.245 --> 08:26.515
I wasn't born yet when
he went off to fight.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.096
Only Anna was.

08:28.262 --> 08:33.118
He knew your soul.
The sweet girl that you'd be.

08:34.409 --> 08:37.807
- He sang to me when I was inside you?
- Everyday.

08:38.913 --> 08:44.035
Rock-a-bye Peggy on the tree top.

08:44.409 --> 08:47.797
When the wind blows the...

08:51.102 --> 08:58.488
- Kate, it's Gerri.
- Please, I'm hungry.

08:58.623 --> 09:03.931
The customers do not want
to see you.  Just stay away!

09:14.475 --> 09:16.132
Gerri!

09:18.487 --> 09:20.623
It's Peggy.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.216
You are always the good one.

09:27.399 --> 09:29.428
I gotta go.

09:40.445 --> 09:43.691
- Where have you been?
- I went in front to get some air.

10:22.907 --> 10:24.692
Can I bring you anything
while you decide?

10:24.759 --> 10:30.628
How are your lubricants prepared?

10:40.771 --> 10:46.844
Four coffees.  Black.
We try to hold it down.

10:47.245 --> 10:50.891
You can try to hold it down,
but you know that I'll win.

10:52.333 --> 10:57.099
Today's special is burgers
and the pie is fresh.

10:57.215 --> 11:02.140
Pie?  Does it come with the kitty
and the grandma we can torture?

11:02.147 --> 11:08.510
We don't eat pie.  We fucking despise pie.
We want meat.  Big nasty pieces of meat.

11:08.511 --> 11:11.053
- Alright, Celia?
- The bigger, the better.

11:11.853 --> 11:16.245
-  Like I said, the burgers...
- Well, there's the... the**.

11:18.339 --> 11:22.058
I ought to get your coffees
and put in your order.

11:24.039 --> 11:27.044
We gonna need a couple
of pounds of ice, angel.

11:27.579 --> 11:28.879
Crushed.

11:29.918 --> 11:31.596
Sure.

11:44.084 --> 11:49.310
We gotta get there, Jak.  They're waiting.
They're gonna buy from somebody else.

11:49.345 --> 11:52.781
It's gonna hold.
We have ice, it's gonna hold.

11:53.705 --> 11:55.532
I want to go to the piss.

13:13.932 --> 13:16.464
Can you fucking believe this?

14:29.491 --> 14:31.186
<i>Have you tried these colors?</i>

14:40.463 --> 14:42.359
Did you make these?

14:43.705 --> 14:44.837
The pies?

14:45.719 --> 14:47.914
My mother made them.

14:50.304 --> 14:53.166
Pies aren't very popular at your table.

14:53.592 --> 14:57.162
Yeah, my friends are **.

14:57.766 --> 15:03.765
They say pain transforms the sensitive
into cynics.  I read that somewhere.

15:04.323 --> 15:09.126
- What's your name?
- Peggy.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.230
You ever out of here?

15:11.231 --> 15:17.031
You never go anywhere?  Or is
this like your existential mode?

15:17.391 --> 15:19.718
Your arc?

15:19.850 --> 15:21.201
No.

15:23.562 --> 15:27.543
- How old are you?
- I'm almost 17.

15:27.556 --> 15:29.591
Do you have a boyfriend?

15:30.418 --> 15:32.079
I bet you want to see the world?

15:32.280 --> 15:35.494
My mother says that there
isn't much left of the world.

15:35.752 --> 15:38.971
Plenty left, if you
know where you to go.

15:42.625 --> 15:44.351
Is that her?

15:44.984 --> 15:49.045
I don't think my mum likes
seeing your friends in here.

15:56.460 --> 15:58.014
You're pretty.

15:58.568 --> 16:01.547
I bet everybody tells you that.

16:05.252 --> 16:07.540
I might be in your neighborhood tonight.

16:07.541 --> 16:12.758
I don't sleep a lot.  My mind
kind of have its mind of its own.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.825
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:14.882 --> 16:20.847
I... usually go out around midnight.
I take in the devastation.

16:20.886 --> 16:23.200
Maybe I'll see you around, Peggy.

16:23.204 --> 16:25.226
You have a girlfriend.

16:28.902 --> 16:30.434
Her?

16:30.523 --> 16:33.062
She is just something to scribble on.

16:33.595 --> 16:35.581
You...

16:35.942 --> 16:39.920
are something I haven't
seen in a long time.

16:55.876 --> 16:59.684
- What does he want?
- Just talk.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.406
About what?

17:01.465 --> 17:02.732
Pie.

17:05.406 --> 17:09.701
Look at them.
No respect for anything.

17:09.702 --> 17:12.394
They just want something
to eat, like everyone else.

17:14.406 --> 17:16.207
He is nice.

17:26.541 --> 17:29.493
We're closing early.
No charge for the coffee

17:30.745 --> 17:33.989
- We didn't get our burgers.
- We want our food.

17:34.089 --> 17:35.173
Sorry.

17:35.931 --> 17:40.606
- You're not sorry.
- I want you all out of here.

17:41.968 --> 17:46.004
- I don't know what to say to you.
- She's a bitch.

17:46.142 --> 17:48.387
- Cunt.
- Shut up, Celia.

17:48.519 --> 17:51.020
We don't eat where
we're not welcomed.

17:51.951 --> 17:55.890
- Hey, bitch cunt... Is that your daughter?
- Shut up!

17:55.892 --> 17:59.431
You shut up.
Is that your daughter?

17:59.508 --> 18:01.064
I feel sorry for her.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.588
You got something ugly inside
of you and it wants out.

18:11.325 --> 18:15.211
I don't wanna be around
when it starts hissing.

18:20.206 --> 18:23.199
You fucking skank.
We don't want to be here anyway.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.044
Screw you, little sweetie.
Fuck you.

18:39.298 --> 18:42.689
They're from Muskeet.
I can smell it on them.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.447
They weren't hurting anyone, mother.

18:44.516 --> 18:47.451
They came to exploit us.
To exploit you.

18:47.455 --> 18:49.953
- He was being friendly.
- It was a trick.

18:50.054 --> 18:53.088
Everything people in Muskeet
do is a goddamn trick!

18:53.520 --> 18:55.840
I'm not losing another daughter.

18:56.500 --> 18:58.699
I have to grow up sometime.

18:58.997 --> 19:02.125
What you have to do is make
your father and sister proud.

19:02.126 --> 19:05.235
Be what they can't be since
the world murdered them.

19:05.469 --> 19:08.702
You are the future of our family.

19:09.851 --> 19:12.422
All that we have left.

19:38.451 --> 19:43.127
<i>Is it obscene?
Or is it Science?</i>

19:43.605 --> 19:47.007
Poetry or pornography?

19:48.064 --> 19:50.855
You have to be the judge.

19:51.036 --> 19:58.703
Come on, take a stand for once
in your vacuous insufferable lives.

20:06.301 --> 20:12.271
The act you will see in a few moments
is not an offering of mere sensation

20:12.300 --> 20:16.678
but a bona-fide
scientific demonstration.

20:16.757 --> 20:19.379
Not for the faint of heart,
nor the weak of will.

20:19.380 --> 20:24.911
Let me caution those of you whose
nerves are not what they used to be.

20:25.077 --> 20:28.611
Get the fuck out now!

20:57.941 --> 21:00.341
<i>No, no.</i>

21:24.637 --> 21:28.160
<i>Couldn't sleep.
Went for a walk.
I'm fine...</i>

22:13.486 --> 22:17.674
Pie is good.
You're asking for trouble, angel.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.397
What are you doing in here?

22:22.013 --> 22:24.485
Short circuiting tragedy.

22:26.046 --> 22:28.553
The world has big teeth.

22:29.155 --> 22:34.344
Eats girls like you for kicks.
If somebody is not looking out for them.

22:34.348 --> 22:37.843
Expose their bathroom
windows and shut like a joke.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.798
Anybody could just pass in.

22:40.802 --> 22:42.959
And you came to fix it?

22:44.018 --> 22:45.712
I came for the pies.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.106
Well you can't be in here.
We're closed.

22:52.325 --> 22:55.633
Maybe you just look that way.

22:58.032 --> 23:01.630
- You  never told me your name?
- Jak.

23:03.613 --> 23:05.004
With no "C".

23:06.427 --> 23:09.109
Oh!  Where did it go?
You have to have a "C".

23:10.169 --> 23:17.262
What will you do, if you have
to say "cat" or "California"?

23:17.799 --> 23:21.868
There is no more California.
Haven't you heard?

23:21.903 --> 23:23.479
I heard.

23:25.683 --> 23:27.330
Come here.

23:32.842 --> 23:36.031
I'm not going to hurt you.
Come here.

23:50.635 --> 23:56.030
It's my sister Anna's.
Anna usually wear lipstick.

23:58.977 --> 24:04.034
So... do you always
come out after dark?

24:04.770 --> 24:09.206
We gotta go after it.
Or I don't come after you.

24:09.538 --> 24:11.057
I like that.

24:12.179 --> 24:16.051
So what do you do?
There is nothing to do.

24:16.812 --> 24:20.595
- Did your mother tell you that?
- I've heard around.

24:20.902 --> 24:24.194
You don't need to know
what around is, do you?

24:25.035 --> 24:26.598
Not exactly.

24:30.138 --> 24:32.326
Did you tell me that
you'd be around tonight,

24:32.339 --> 24:34.537
so I'd come here and
you could hurt me

24:35.613 --> 24:38.530
Maybe I hoped you
could take away my hurt?

24:38.707 --> 24:41.091
They say everybody gets
what they deserve.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.978
Well, I hope they're right.

24:54.967 --> 24:57.153
Come on.

24:59.934 --> 25:03.089
- Aren't you tots out a little late?
- Not yet.

25:03.189 --> 25:04.799
Mummy let you out?

25:04.850 --> 25:07.495
Jak, I should go home.

25:08.178 --> 25:09.508
Don't you want to get out?

25:09.509 --> 25:13.521
I shouldn't be out long.
My mum will be worried sick.

25:14.593 --> 25:20.294
We got places to be, Jak.
Things to sell, Jak.

25:20.621 --> 25:25.260
I'm not going to let anything happen
to you.  Except what you want.

25:28.513 --> 25:30.422
<i>Smile... </i>

25:30.522 --> 25:34.548
<i>I wanna RIDE...</i>

25:34.648 --> 25:40.535
<i>with my twisty turvy baby</i>

25:40.598 --> 25:43.350
<i>by my SIDE...</i>

25:44.388 --> 25:52.288
<i>As we...
As we whiz along the highway.</i>

25:52.380 --> 25:56.534
<i>We'll  hug and snuggle</i>

25:56.569 --> 26:01.732
<i>and have a little STRUGGLE! </i>

26:01.779 --> 26:08.031
Struggle, the act of promiscuous love
play, usage evolved during W.W.III..

26:08.166 --> 26:10.720
Personally recommended.

26:13.437 --> 26:17.486
You can have your walkin'
under moonlight beams.

26:17.502 --> 26:23.142
At a hundred miles an hour
let me DREAM my fucking DREAMS.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.720
Feels good, doesn't it?

27:58.344 --> 28:02.247
It's alright.

28:03.994 --> 28:06.809
Now.
Yes.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.647
Snacks anyone?

28:54.367 --> 28:59.913
- What is it?
- It's what's inside your head, angel.

29:00.268 --> 29:03.459
Relax and come out to play!

29:42.031 --> 29:46.496
Girls!  You're make a mess,
ruining the backyard.

29:46.497 --> 29:49.644
I want get this close-up.
Try it again, shall we?

29:50.021 --> 29:53.416
You're seven years old today,
isn't that right, Peg?

29:53.417 --> 29:56.406
Peggy.  Not Peg.

29:57.238 --> 29:58.904
Peggy!

30:02.155 --> 30:03.681
Anna!

30:05.203 --> 30:09.161
- You only let Peggy do it.
- Sweetheart, it's Peggy's birthday

30:09.261 --> 30:11.666
You wouldn't let me do it,
even if it was my birthday.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.040
I wish daddy were here.
He'd be on my side.

30:14.069 --> 30:17.247
Your sister is tired of your complaining.

30:17.552 --> 30:19.658
What's wrong with the sky?

30:27.390 --> 30:33.073
It's Blitz!  Everybody
take cover.  Take cover.

30:40.061 --> 30:42.161
Mum!

31:03.936 --> 31:05.478
Yes, yes, in here!

31:06.816 --> 31:11.523
- Katie.!
- it's okay.  We're safe.

31:17.258 --> 31:20.227
What are you doing!?
Just let us in!

31:21.554 --> 31:24.045
We can't let them get in here.

31:24.790 --> 31:27.061
- Let us in!
- I can't!

31:27.190 --> 31:29.272
Let them in!

31:29.300 --> 31:32.082
- Let them in!
- No!

31:33.775 --> 31:37.527
It will kill us.  It will
kill us if we let them in!

31:45.264 --> 31:49.232
We're safe.

31:55.782 --> 32:02.921
I think I feel something going up
the stairs into my fucking brain.

32:07.177 --> 32:10.693
- How long was I out?
- A few minutes.

32:10.694 --> 32:12.592
Did you go somewhere good?

32:15.364 --> 32:17.859
I saw bad things.

32:18.499 --> 32:23.087
It drop visit my birthday when I was seven
and I watched my friends burnt to death.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.349
I lost my folks to Blitz.

32:26.087 --> 32:28.187
My brother and my sister.

32:28.263 --> 32:31.079
Yeah, Blitz got a lot of people.

32:31.668 --> 32:36.661
Hey Jak, you gotta to teach the
deadly cha-cha to mussle-tussle.

32:37.016 --> 32:39.973
Mussle-tussle.
Now!

32:40.466 --> 32:47.914
Slang term used to describe the
injection of a drug into a muscle.

32:49.060 --> 32:52.933
Usage evolved during World War III.

32:53.710 --> 32:57.974
That was one busy mother fucking war!

33:06.415 --> 33:11.137
- Ever seen a loopy's dance, Bambi?
- Shut up, Celia.

33:11.139 --> 33:15.370
You've got to show that to Bambi.
Give her a little thrill.

33:17.039 --> 33:20.208
- Jak, I want go home.
- Yeah, we all do.

33:24.569 --> 33:30.243
You be a beast, beast,
beast, beast... man!

33:59.313 --> 34:00.637
Peggy?

34:04.622 --> 34:05.744
Peggy?

34:16.018 --> 34:18.275
Liar!

34:19.121 --> 34:24.045
Got to you!
Got to you!

35:59.859 --> 36:04.617
- What's that smell?
- Muskeet.

36:04.892 --> 36:07.683
I think I'm away too too long.
I don't want to miss call my mum.

36:07.761 --> 36:09.564
I don't know.

36:09.618 --> 36:13.337
Bet you have the best time of your life?

36:13.981 --> 36:15.173
I like you.

36:15.408 --> 36:18.083
- Yeah, what do you like?
- Everything.

36:18.084 --> 36:19.248
Everything...

36:20.399 --> 36:23.761
- So where we're going?
- Doom Room

36:23.802 --> 36:26.376
Do a little businesses.
Have a little fun.

36:26.377 --> 36:29.367
I wanna fuck her.

36:31.472 --> 36:33.362
Fuck away!

36:35.437 --> 36:36.853
I'm okay.

36:36.854 --> 36:38.976
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.615
Except what I want.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.219
Except what you want.

36:45.232 --> 36:49.797
<i>And the the controversy over L.U.P,
commonly referred to as Luppis </i>

36:49.897 --> 36:51.770
<i>has now reached the Supreme Court,</i>

36:51.771 --> 36:55.692
<i>which will decide the fate of the
phenomenon, which has horrified and...</i>

37:47.016 --> 37:50.097
That was our house band, folks.

37:50.398 --> 37:54.663
Let 'em know you care by
putting your hands together

37:55.939 --> 38:01.603
like you're swatting something
small and helpless.

38:02.337 --> 38:11.060
Well, tonight's main course is on the
plate and almost ready to eat, kitties.

38:11.064 --> 38:15.438
- Are we hungry?
- Yeah!

38:27.435 --> 38:29.070
Shut up!

38:29.187 --> 38:30.404
Shut up!

38:30.505 --> 38:33.576
Shut up!  You, you!
All of you!

38:44.127 --> 38:46.228
Gracias.

38:50.211 --> 38:59.216
Well, since we run an upscale establishment
management has requested no guns

38:59.316 --> 39:02.625
no meaningful conversation...

39:02.626 --> 39:05.623
and no self-surgery during the show.

39:05.723 --> 39:09.331
Now, as for legal
details, since you asked,

39:09.344 --> 39:12.963
let's cut to the final
event quickly, shall we.

39:13.163 --> 39:19.429
In 2008, a clause in post war bar
allowed for an L.U.P performance

39:19.529 --> 39:23.245
provided it was already practiced
as a scientific exposition.

39:23.246 --> 39:27.011
Hence!
My old precious!

39:29.336 --> 39:33.117
Want to see it again?
Yeah, you do! Yeah, you do!

39:36.784 --> 39:42.249
Well!  And where are
these lovely folks from?

39:44.278 --> 39:47.108
Your ass.

39:48.995 --> 39:50.879
You are funny.

39:52.673 --> 39:57.672
I will destroy you someday, trust me.

39:57.931 --> 40:00.334
Enjoy the show!

40:04.455 --> 40:09.384
Boxx and I gotta go talk to this guy.
I'll be back here in a minute.

40:12.089 --> 40:16.223
- They say this is totally sick.
- What?  What is it?

40:16.537 --> 40:19.703
It's what happens to people like me.

40:35.728 --> 40:37.714
Back off, asshole!

40:38.676 --> 40:42.316
Back off!  You want to
get cut sucker, you want it?

40:47.998 --> 40:51.256
The materials you brought
earlier were inferior...

40:52.375 --> 40:54.901
What're you talking about?
It was solid red.

40:54.914 --> 40:57.450
That shit was one
step away from water.

40:57.870 --> 41:00.511
How old were they?
A hundred years?

41:01.170 --> 41:02.893
This stuff is good.

41:03.410 --> 41:08.810
You understand, that I do not covet
some impossible standard here?

41:09.950 --> 41:13.201
Only a quality level which
will engender a performance,

41:13.302 --> 41:18.244
that does not insult to
myself, or my patrons.

41:21.172 --> 41:22.879
Not finished.

41:23.855 --> 41:26.524
As we all agree

41:26.614 --> 41:33.209
fresh plasma engenders and reinvigorates
the drama of the performance.

41:33.309 --> 41:36.645
And my patrons, appreciate that.

41:38.036 --> 41:43.988
Look, we were after the
highest quality stuff, okay?

41:44.188 --> 41:48.937
We try.  But nothing on
the street is consistent.

41:50.948 --> 41:54.066
- Change streets, honey.
- The stuff we got is good.

41:54.166 --> 41:58.438
We put it on ice, we did the whole deal.
It's gonna do the trick.

42:06.475 --> 42:09.621
Well, maybe yes,
maybe no.

42:09.721 --> 42:12.350
I will incorporate what
you procure in the next show,

42:12.351 --> 42:19.165
and if quality is sufficient, then
we will arrive an equitable fee.

42:19.380 --> 42:25.437
If not, I'll pour the rest down your
fucking throats like they were toilets.

42:26.896 --> 42:29.522
Enjoys the show, boys.

42:49.502 --> 42:51.743
Now you like that, don't you?

42:52.357 --> 42:55.921
- Hey, the table only sits four now.
- Go away, fuckhead!

43:10.075 --> 43:11.897
Are you okay?

43:19.302 --> 43:23.320
Orange Swamp, straight up all around.

43:26.463 --> 43:31.882
Fuck, we've been waiting long enough.
When does this goddamn room open up?

43:32.792 --> 43:39.011
Well, well, well.   All ghastly
things come to those who wait.

43:39.130 --> 43:45.385
And the time has come.
Who's ready for the show?

43:45.389 --> 43:52.024
Who wants behold the miraculous,
obscene, phenomenon of our times.

43:52.180 --> 43:54.957
Hands.

43:55.093 --> 43:59.364
Who wants to the see the LUP?
(Lifeless Undeath Phenomenon)

43:59.424 --> 44:02.660
Come on, kitties.
Say it with me.

44:02.665 --> 44:09.155
We want to see the LUP?

44:12.477 --> 44:21.158
<i>We want to see the LUP.
We want to see the LUP.</i>

44:21.229 --> 44:29.863
Ladies and gentlemen, brace yourselves.
The LUP phenomenon is here right now!

44:29.963 --> 44:34.878
The Luppis are in the house!

44:37.309 --> 44:39.517
Please, Jak, can we leave?

44:39.518 --> 44:42.724
Just watch, okay.  We gotta
watch the end of the show.

44:55.572 --> 45:00.290
This freak of physiological abnormality

45:00.292 --> 45:03.205
was first discovered during the war.

45:03.305 --> 45:06.920
When, following certain chemical attacks

45:06.922 --> 45:11.811
many of the dead troops
were found standing...

45:13.301 --> 45:15.030
erect...

45:15.032 --> 45:19.920
perform the spasmodic gyrations which,

45:19.921 --> 45:25.369
later, became affectionately
known as the "loopy's" dance.

45:26.192 --> 45:29.035
Some of them even continued to fight!

45:29.037 --> 45:34.071
And that, my friends,
is fucking patriotism.

45:35.061 --> 45:39.437
The chemical responsible
was later distilled

45:39.438 --> 45:44.897
and is now used in carefully
conducted scientific experiments

45:45.182 --> 45:49.596
under the strictest
of legal supervision...

45:49.597 --> 45:52.166
Well... almost!

45:52.402 --> 45:56.793
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

45:56.828 --> 45:59.830
The dance of the dead!

46:39.290 --> 46:42.423
The pace is on fucking fire, man!

47:01.488 --> 47:05.990
Well, how did you like
our first dancer, hmm?

47:06.228 --> 47:09.253
Make you  consider the career in... hmm

47:09.288 --> 47:11.265
science?

47:14.110 --> 47:19.375
Oh you just can't get enough
of the LUP, can you?

47:19.378 --> 47:25.370
Nah, nothing like a little Lifeless
Undeath Phenomenon, to lighten things up

47:25.373 --> 47:28.530
in a dull fucking nowhere town!

47:29.365 --> 47:33.750
We've got more icky spasmodic
surprises in store!.

47:33.751 --> 47:36.649
It's time to welcome our next dancer.

47:36.937 --> 47:40.935
A girl who just loves the limelight.

47:40.936 --> 47:45.120
Make her feel welcome, and maybe
she'll return the empty gesture

47:45.121 --> 47:49.070
by dancing her jellied heart out.

49:06.488 --> 49:08.361
What is it?

49:08.386 --> 49:10.502
Oh my God,  it's her!
Oh my God!

49:10.602 --> 49:11.502
Anna!

49:11.855 --> 49:12.855
Anna!

49:17.226 --> 49:18.326
Anna!

49:18.914 --> 49:20.870
Oh my God!

49:21.020 --> 49:25.234
Anna! Anna!  We have to get out.
We have to get out now!

49:25.267 --> 49:28.076
- My sister! My sister!
- Really?

49:28.167 --> 49:31.660
- We have to go.  Get out!
- I don't fucking care.  I want my money!

49:31.662 --> 49:34.633
- She's my fucking sister!
- I want my money!

49:35.740 --> 49:37.144
Give me the fucking gun, Boxx.

49:37.199 --> 49:39.069
That's not her fucking sister, man.

49:39.070 --> 49:40.817
She's wasted.
She's seeing shit.

49:40.852 --> 49:42.920
Gives me the fucking gun, Boxx!

49:42.923 --> 49:46.425
- I  don't know where to go!
- Shut the fuck up and give me the gun!

49:53.575 --> 49:56.495
- You're fucking dead, pussy!
- Fuck you, Jak!

49:56.496 --> 49:58.421
Get out of the fucking way!

49:58.751 --> 50:00.222
Back off!

50:01.223 --> 50:02.311
Back off, fuck off!

50:02.312 --> 50:06.541
- Get the fuck out of the way!
- Get out of the fucking way!

50:08.005 --> 50:11.179
<i>Hey!  Comes back here.!</i>

50:11.848 --> 50:14.584
Get the fuck out of my way!

50:15.456 --> 50:18.546
Get the fuck back!
Back off!

50:19.189 --> 50:22.296
Back fucking off!
Now!

50:50.020 --> 50:51.601
Peggy!

50:54.308 --> 50:57.176
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

50:57.297 --> 50:59.551
I found her, mum.
I found Anna.

51:00.109 --> 51:01.409
Jak!

51:17.371 --> 51:22.010
- Where are you going with my dancer, Jak?
- Your dancer?  She's my sister!

51:22.030 --> 51:24.844
How the hell did she get here?
What is she doing here?

51:25.036 --> 51:28.359
Oh not much.
She's dead.

51:28.559 --> 51:32.288
In a freezer all day.

51:33.118 --> 51:35.396
I take her out.
I shoot her up.

51:35.586 --> 51:37.680
She dances a little.
I sell some tickets.

51:37.685 --> 51:40.015
I pay the rent.
Now.

51:40.017 --> 51:42.315
I'll take her back.
She's mine.

51:44.025 --> 51:46.860
- Stay out of it, Jakie.
- Too late.

51:46.863 --> 51:50.010
- She is not your property.
- Really?

51:50.012 --> 51:53.271
I paid for her.
Ask your mummy

52:00.304 --> 52:02.209
What's he talking about?

52:03.019 --> 52:08.299
- What is he talking about?
- Tell her. It's a heart warming story, ma.

52:08.361 --> 52:13.499
Let's go.  Let's go before things gets
worse.  She's not alive.  Let him have her!

52:13.522 --> 52:19.726
A story brimming with loyalty and
commitment and a mother's undying love.

52:26.713 --> 52:30.451
- Shoot him.
- I want to hear his story.

52:32.883 --> 52:36.531
Don't, please.
Please don't...

52:38.180 --> 52:44.850
I see.
I think... it went something like this.

52:47.536 --> 52:52.085
Your mother was sick and tired of
coming to my club every weekend

52:52.086 --> 52:54.817
to fetch your strung out sister.

52:54.863 --> 52:56.998
Your son of a bitch!

52:56.999 --> 53:05.804
And when sis OD'd... mum here
decided just to leave her to me.

53:06.006 --> 53:09.241
No fuss.
No muss.

53:09.924 --> 53:13.740
And as I recall, she was still alive.

53:13.742 --> 53:15.359
Stop it.

53:15.794 --> 53:17.401
Stop it.

53:17.634 --> 53:22.779
How much did I pay you for her?
I forget.

53:22.780 --> 53:29.676
I usually pay by the pound, but...
she was such a sweet, pretty little thing.

53:49.740 --> 53:50.958
Peggy.

53:53.456 --> 53:55.461
Oh Peggy.

53:58.763 --> 54:02.946
When daddy...
When daddy died...

54:04.322 --> 54:06.691
we had nothing.

54:11.046 --> 54:14.719
She was always in trouble.

54:15.299 --> 54:18.338
She was half dead.

54:21.166 --> 54:23.810
You sold her.

54:35.712 --> 54:40.116
We had nothing.

54:57.615 --> 55:02.824
This has been festive and touching.
But I have a club to run.

55:02.854 --> 55:08.004
And I've already had one show
fucked today.  You owe me.

55:08.781 --> 55:10.773
Fuck you.

55:11.341 --> 55:14.011
Promises, promises.

55:26.719 --> 55:29.838
I'll make it right.

55:55.915 --> 55:58.354
I'm all alone now.

56:03.349 --> 56:06.089
You don't have to be.

56:20.006 --> 56:25.090
For those of you who've never
had standards, or a fucking heart...

56:25.116 --> 56:27.814
the Doom Room welcomes you.

56:27.938 --> 56:33.620
And tonight, we have
something very, very special.

56:33.623 --> 56:39.467
So cover the kids' ears and drug
the dog till he can't fight back...

56:39.567 --> 56:44.369
'cause tonight's dancer has
a whole lot of shakin' going on

56:44.370 --> 56:47.379
and we don't want anyone to get hurt.

56:47.721 --> 56:52.204
Proving that death is just a ugly rumor.

56:52.623 --> 56:56.572
And I do mean ugly.

56:58.553 --> 57:01.682
Ladies and gentlemen.
I give you...

57:02.111 --> 57:05.661
the dance of the dead.
