The whole city's behind you,

02:29.950 --> 02:30.684
man.

02:30.717 --> 02:31.983
What are you wearing?

02:32.016 --> 02:33.616
It's the bling-blong, baby.

02:33.649 --> 02:34.916
It represents my lifestyle and

02:34.949 --> 02:36.616

That's the chirp.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.313
I gotta take this.

02:49.346 --> 02:50.213
Where you at, Dawg?

02:50.246 --> 02:50.980

He's in the shot.

02:59.578 --> 03:00.644
He'll get face-time.

03:00.678 --> 03:01.510
The guy just started.

03:01.543 --> 03:02.350
Give him a break.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.417

03:03.450 --> 03:04.083
So nervous.

03:04.117 --> 03:04.750

03:08.949 --> 03:09.582

03:09.616 --> 03:10.349
Don't push me, all right.

03:10.382 --> 03:11.015
There we go.

03:11.048 --> 03:11.748
All right.

03:11.781 --> 03:12.415
Now, you, over there,

03:12.448 --> 03:13.248

03:30.844 --> 03:31.911
Yello, Dawg.

03:33.711 --> 03:35.343
Oh, it doesn't have that?

03:35.376 --> 03:36.510
Ok.

03:36.543 --> 03:37.810
But it still has text messaging,

03:37.843 --> 03:38.710
right?

03:38.743 --> 03:41.609
Write actual words with a phone.

03:41.642 --> 03:42.909
Right, ha ha ha.

03:42.942 --> 03:44.075
Ok.

03:44.109 --> 03:45.474
Say, why don't we see if the

03:45.508 --> 03:47.174
Boost Mobile phone wants to go

03:53.307 --> 03:55.572
We're going to Jeff-hizzy!

03:55.606 --> 03:56.406
Shake, I know what you've

03:56.439 --> 03:57.539
done, and I don't like it.

03:57.572 --> 03:58.372
Aren't we going to Jeffy's

03:58.406 --> 03:59.039
house?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.338
Uh, he's my cousin.

04:00.371 --> 04:01.605
He's my best friend.

04:01.638 --> 04:03.378
I have--i haven't seen him since

04:03.411 --> 04:05.377
the Army, like, 1,000 years ago.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.710
Ok, is he your cousin or your

04:06.744 --> 04:07.377
friend?

04:07.410 --> 04:08.310
He is both.

04:08.344 --> 04:09.443
And I--he's--

04:09.476 --> 04:10.343
he'll only stay for a--

04:10.376 --> 04:11.943
you know, like 3 year

04:11.976 --> 04:12.643
commitment.

04:12.676 --> 04:13.709
After that, we'll see if we'll

04:13.743 --> 04:14.408
renew.

04:14.442 --> 04:15.208
Aren't we going to Jeffy's

04:15.242 --> 04:15.875

04:15.908 --> 04:16.708
Come on, Dawg.

You're into this.

04:18.108 --> 04:20.406
You're black.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.840
You sound black.

04:23.873 --> 04:24.773
Where are you from?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.640
Come on, y'all.

04:25.673 --> 04:26.706
When are we going to Jeffy's

04:26.740 --> 04:27.373

04:27.406 --> 04:28.672
Jeffy the garden hose?

04:28.705 --> 04:29.505
You know what?

04:29.539 --> 04:30.539
Bing.

04:30.572 --> 04:31.639
I just killed Jeffy

04:31.672 --> 04:32.839

04:34.171 --> 04:34.938
Yes!

04:34.971 --> 04:35.604
Meatwad...

04:36.537 --> 04:37.371

04:49.401 --> 04:51.801
Sorry for the mix-up, pal.

04:51.835 --> 04:52.700
I do.

04:52.734 --> 04:54.634
Yes, I do like my balls.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.666
No, there's absolutely no need

04:57.699 --> 04:58.899
to hand them to me in front of

04:58.933 --> 05:00.933
the new york sales team.

05:00.966 --> 05:02.872
I--yes.

05:02.905 --> 05:03.938
You got it.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.772
Ok, buddy.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.538
You sound thinner.

05:06.572 --> 05:07.704
Did you lose weight?

05:07.737 --> 05:08.571
Ok, great.

05:08.604 --> 05:09.371
Ok, thanks.

05:18.602 --> 05:19.502
Yep.

05:19.535 --> 05:20.435
They're dancing up a storm

05:20.469 --> 05:21.535

05:21.569 --> 05:22.668
So, why am I out here with

05:22.701 --> 05:23.501

05:23.534 --> 05:24.601
You wanted to see Jeffy.

See?

05:25.768 --> 05:27.367
He's alive.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.200
There's Jeffy.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.233
He's a damn garden hose, boy.

Come on.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.566
Look at you talking to it.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.366
Ha ha ha.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.399
You a fool.

05:34.432 --> 05:35.532
What the hell is this here?

05:35.566 --> 05:36.498
Some uh...

05:36.531 --> 05:37.865
Some sort of gay-out?

Just the guy I wanted to see!

05:41.297 --> 05:42.464

05:42.497 --> 05:43.930

What are you dancing about

05:44.997 --> 05:45.996

05:46.029 --> 05:46.796
You're poor.

05:46.829 --> 05:47.496
Come here.

05:47.529 --> 05:48.163
I want you to listen to

05:48.196 --> 05:48.863
something.

05:49.863 --> 05:50.596
You hear the chirp?

05:50.629 --> 05:51.495
Isn't that clear?

05:51.528 --> 05:52.528
Isn't it clear that I'm gonna

05:52.562 --> 05:53.662
just completely your ass

05:53.695 --> 05:55.495
up if you don't take 3 steps

05:55.528 --> 05:58.194
back?

05:58.227 --> 06:00.361
It's not, is it?

06:00.394 --> 06:02.100
You just look at me.

06:02.133 --> 06:03.033
Look at him looking at me.

06:03.066 --> 06:03.900
But you can make and receive

06:03.933 --> 06:05.632
cellular calls with this.

06:05.665 --> 06:06.365
Give it to him.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.099
Where you at, dawg?!

06:07.132 --> 06:07.799
See?

06:07.832 --> 06:08.599
I'm on my land.

06:08.632 --> 06:09.732
We're both in America--

06:09.765 --> 06:11.231
which used to be a good country

06:11.264 --> 06:12.098
until they started letting

06:12.131 --> 06:13.498
people like you do whatever you

06:13.531 --> 06:14.164
want.

06:14.198 --> 06:15.430
Hey, Dawg, where you at?!

06:15.463 --> 06:16.230
See?

06:16.263 --> 06:17.397
See this.

06:17.430 --> 06:19.130
This line here--

06:19.163 --> 06:20.362
line of death.

06:20.396 --> 06:21.429
You cross it,

06:21.462 --> 06:22.662
and your freedoms no longer

06:22.696 --> 06:23.962
exist.

06:23.996 --> 06:24.895
Ok?

06:24.928 --> 06:25.795
Have a good day.

06:25.828 --> 06:26.861
Where you at, dawg?!

06:26.895 --> 06:27.761
Shake, how long is this phone

06:27.795 --> 06:28.828
gonna be here?

06:28.861 --> 06:29.860
With Boost Mobile,

06:29.894 --> 06:30.694
you pay as you go.

06:30.727 --> 06:31.494
Yeah, yeah.

06:31.527 --> 06:32.360
No contracts.

06:32.394 --> 06:33.294
No bills.

06:33.327 --> 06:34.426
No hassle.

06:34.459 --> 06:35.093
Wait, wait!

06:35.126 --> 06:35.959
Where you going?

06:35.993 --> 06:36.859
It's such a tight fit for how

06:36.893 --> 06:38.293
you roll, dawg.

06:38.326 --> 06:39.692
We're east side, west side,

06:39.725 --> 06:40.592
outside--

06:40.625 --> 06:41.858
Well, we're going inside.

06:41.892 --> 06:44.257
Wait, are y'all going dance--
hey, I was gonna dance out

06:44.291 --> 06:45.091
there!

06:45.124 --> 06:46.457
Come on!

06:46.491 --> 06:47.857
We were just about to do some

06:47.891 --> 06:50.090
hands-free national roaming!

06:52.990 --> 06:55.922
You know what I want to do?

06:55.955 --> 06:58.754
Learn how to milk a cow.

06:58.788 --> 06:59.888
Ok.

06:59.921 --> 07:00.754
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

07:00.788 --> 07:01.821
Where you goin', dawg?!

07:01.854 --> 07:02.661
Uh, I'm gonna teach Meatwad

07:02.694 --> 07:03.428
how to milk a cow.

07:03.461 --> 07:04.127
I'm gonna learn how to

07:04.160 --> 07:04.993
milk a cow!

07:05.027 --> 07:05.860
All right, that's not very

07:05.893 --> 07:07.027
urban.

07:07.060 --> 07:07.960
Uh...

07:07.993 --> 07:09.792
Hey, maybe we could take you to

07:09.826 --> 07:11.692
the Ludacris concert, huh?

07:11.726 --> 07:12.826
Or we can, like, watch

07:12.859 --> 07:13.658
"Sanford and Son."

07:13.691 --> 07:14.325
It'll be on in, like,

07:14.358 --> 07:14.991
15 minutes.

07:15.025 --> 07:15.791
No.

07:15.825 --> 07:16.691
We're going to a farm

07:16.725 --> 07:17.858
to milk a cow.

07:17.891 --> 07:19.624
Well, that's not really the

07:19.657 --> 07:22.024
message we hope to convey here.

07:22.057 --> 07:23.356
But it's the milk that I hope

07:23.389 --> 07:24.023
to drink.

07:24.056 --> 07:24.689
All right.

07:24.723 --> 07:26.789
Well, we're gonna come, too,

07:26.823 --> 07:28.988
because you might need to make

07:29.022 --> 07:31.022
or receive a cellular call.

07:32.122 --> 07:33.287
Where is this farm?

07:33.321 --> 07:34.087
So, how's the reception back

07:34.121 --> 07:34.754
there?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.621
Solid, dawg!

07:36.654 --> 07:37.953
Where is this farm, boy?

07:37.986 --> 07:38.720
How 'bout now?

07:38.753 --> 07:39.386
Lovin' it.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.186
All bars, baby.

07:41.220 --> 07:42.752
Hardy-har-har.

07:42.785 --> 07:43.885
It's a little hot.

07:43.919 --> 07:44.985
Where is this farm?

07:45.019 --> 07:46.085
We're 3,000 miles below the

07:46.119 --> 07:47.451
earth's surface, Meatwad.

07:47.484 --> 07:48.384
A cow would melt under these

07:48.418 --> 07:49.384
conditions.

07:49.418 --> 07:50.218
Why you gotta be a

07:50.251 --> 07:51.018
playa-hater?

07:51.051 --> 07:51.851
Man, I think I'm out of my

07:51.884 --> 07:52.617
zone.

07:52.650 --> 07:53.550
I'm not feeling good.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.283
Oh, no.

07:54.317 --> 07:55.450
He's losing reception.

07:55.483 --> 07:56.483
Really?

07:56.517 --> 07:57.282
Well, then.

07:57.316 --> 07:58.049
We'll just have to keep going

07:58.082 --> 07:58.916
then, huh?

07:58.949 --> 07:59.916
No, we can't do that!

07:59.949 --> 08:01.049
Somebody call Josh.

08:01.082 --> 08:01.988
This is a friend of mine,

08:02.021 --> 08:03.255
and we're outside his cellular

08:03.288 --> 08:04.355
coverage!

08:04.388 --> 08:05.688
He could die down here without a

08:05.721 --> 08:06.421
signal.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.520
Hey, were you at, Josh?!

08:09.554 --> 08:10.454
Shake, hey--you--

08:10.487 --> 08:11.154
you're not coming in clear

08:11.187 --> 08:11.953
anymore.

08:11.986 --> 08:12.686
Yeah, where you at?

08:12.719 --> 08:13.386
You're breaking--

08:13.419 --> 08:14.519
you're breaking up on me, babe.

08:14.553 --> 08:16.086
Go further.

08:16.119 --> 08:17.018
What?

08:17.052 --> 08:18.085
Touch my screen, man.

08:18.118 --> 08:19.318
I'm feeling faint.

08:19.352 --> 08:20.418
Hello?

08:20.452 --> 08:21.217
Hello?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.384
Hello!

08:22.417 --> 08:23.384
It's dead.

08:23.417 --> 08:24.284
No signal.

08:24.317 --> 08:25.317
Ok, but that was pretty fun,

08:25.351 --> 08:26.583
right?

08:26.616 --> 08:27.516
Don't look at me like that.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.616
I'll buy you anything you want.

08:28.650 --> 08:29.850
See, this chain?

08:29.883 --> 08:30.816
I'm rich, bitch!

08:30.849 --> 08:31.849
You whored us out to some

08:31.882 --> 08:33.082
cell phone company, didn't you?!

08:33.115 --> 08:34.615
You say that like it's bad.

08:34.649 --> 08:35.315
It is.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.048
But when you do it...

08:37.081 --> 08:37.914
It's great.

08:37.948 --> 08:38.648
Turn around, Meatwad,

08:38.681 --> 08:40.114
before we all burst into flames.

08:40.148 --> 08:41.013
When we gonna learn how to

08:41.047 --> 08:42.147
milk a cow?!

08:42.179 --> 08:43.313
Oh, Meatwad, we just did.

08:43.347 --> 08:44.246
Don't you remember?

08:44.280 --> 08:44.980
Oh.

08:45.013 --> 08:46.079
Oh, yeah.

08:46.112 --> 08:47.712
Yeah, that was fun.

08:47.746 --> 08:49.479
Now, find me a jukebox with

08:49.512 --> 08:51.211
shaun cassidy on it.

08:51.245 --> 08:52.378
Ok.

08:52.411 --> 08:53.445
But that's back at the house.

08:53.478 --> 08:54.211
Ok, no, no, no.

08:54.245 --> 08:54.945
We can't go there.

08:54.978 --> 08:55.844
They're gonna so be looking for

08:55.877 --> 08:56.644
me.

08:56.677 --> 08:57.544
And Josh said if I screw this

08:57.577 --> 08:59.544
up, two important pieces of my

08:59.577 --> 09:01.509
body will be yanked out and

09:01.543 --> 09:04.083
resituated elsewhere.

09:04.116 --> 09:05.648
I do want children someday.

09:05.682 --> 09:06.715
It's over, Shake.

09:06.748 --> 09:07.982
Ok, ok.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.448
I'll end it.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.881
Just let me do it my way.

09:11.914 --> 09:12.747
Hey!

09:12.781 --> 09:14.946
More Boost Mobile phones!

09:14.980 --> 09:16.080
Where you at, Dawgs?!

09:16.113 --> 09:16.846
Yo, Dawg!

09:16.880 --> 09:17.813
Where you at?!

09:17.846 --> 09:18.846
Where you at?!

09:18.880 --> 09:19.979
This is your way of ending

09:20.012 --> 09:20.779
this?

09:20.812 --> 09:21.812
Don't put words in my mouth!

09:21.845 --> 09:22.679
Well, where you going, dawg?

09:22.712 --> 09:23.545
Well, I'm...

09:23.579 --> 09:25.178
Gonna roll...

09:25.211 --> 09:26.244
With my homies...

09:26.278 --> 09:27.011
On lakeshore.

09:27.044 --> 09:27.878
Yeah, that's right.

09:27.911 --> 09:28.611
That's just where we

09:28.644 --> 09:29.277
were going!

09:29.310 --> 09:30.177
And if we have some time,

09:30.210 --> 09:31.910
we might even...

09:31.943 --> 09:32.977
Get some...

09:33.010 --> 09:33.643
Hos.

09:33.677 --> 09:34.676
And snuggle with 'em,

09:34.709 --> 09:36.176
and give 'em a kissy-kiss,

09:36.209 --> 09:37.709
'cause they good girls--

09:37.742 --> 09:39.308
even though they hos.

09:39.341 --> 09:40.108
Come on, Dawgs,

09:40.141 --> 09:40.941
let's roll!

09:40.975 --> 09:41.875
Bitches and hos!

09:41.908 --> 09:42.675
Aagh!

09:42.708 --> 09:43.840
Now, Meatwad!

09:43.874 --> 09:46.274
No!

09:47.207 --> 09:48.240
Yes!

09:48.274 --> 09:49.106
Now, let's go inside and get

09:49.139 --> 09:50.039
some sleep.

09:50.073 --> 09:51.573
Ok.

09:52.506 --> 09:53.273
the landline.

09:53.305 --> 09:54.438
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

09:54.472 --> 09:55.472
Don't answer it!

09:56.338 --> 09:57.105
Oh, yeah, Josh,

09:57.138 --> 09:57.805
how you doing?

09:57.838 --> 09:58.837
I'm not here, I'm not here!

09:58.871 --> 09:59.637
I am not here.

09:59.671 --> 10:00.537
I'm his roommate.

10:00.571 --> 10:01.237
I'm not here.

10:01.271 --> 10:01.911
Yeah.

10:01.944 --> 10:02.944
Oh, yeah, he's here.

10:02.976 --> 10:03.643
I'm not here.

10:03.676 --> 10:04.576
Hold on.

10:04.610 --> 10:05.576
Josh!

10:05.610 --> 10:06.276
Hey!

10:06.310 --> 10:06.976
Where--

10:07.010 --> 10:08.442
where you at, Dawg?

10:08.475 --> 10:09.375
Yes.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.075
I'm really sorry about that.

10:12.109 --> 10:13.008
My checks have cleared,

10:13.041 --> 10:14.774
so my hands are unfortunately

10:14.808 --> 10:16.341
tied at this point.

10:16.374 --> 10:17.740
What?

10:17.773 --> 10:18.873
Ok, I gotta put the phone down.

10:18.907 --> 10:21.140
Hold--

10:21.173 --> 10:23.072
it has vibracall alert

10:23.106 --> 10:26.339
and downloadable ringtones.

10:26.372 --> 10:28.138
Oh, come on, man.

10:28.171 --> 10:29.338
Do you realize I'm an action

10:29.371 --> 10:30.838
hero and that I don't have time

10:30.871 --> 10:32.304
for this crap?

10:32.337 --> 10:34.204
Yes, I said crap!

10:34.237 --> 10:35.537
That's what it is!

10:35.570 --> 10:36.737
Crap.

10:36.770 --> 10:37.669
Aagh!

10:37.703 --> 10:38.703
Hey, Dawg, where you at!

10:38.736 --> 10:39.403
Were you at, Dawg?

10:39.436 --> 10:40.169
Whoa!

10:40.203 --> 10:41.236
You do have molecular

10:41.269 --> 10:43.168
transporters!

10:43.202 --> 10:44.335
Wow.

10:44.368 --> 10:47.034
Downloadable switchblades, huh?

10:47.067 --> 10:48.467
That's a new featu--

10:48.501 --> 10:49.334
oh, no!

10:49.367 --> 10:50.434
Aagh!

10:53.133 --> 10:54.433
Hey, hey!

10:54.466 --> 10:55.866
It's axe body spray.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.965
Where are the girls?

10:56.999 --> 10:57.865
No, there ain't no girls

10:57.899 --> 10:58.865
here.

10:58.899 --> 10:59.932
Can I help you though?

10:59.965 --> 11:01.331
Uh, yeah.

11:01.364 --> 11:02.571
Are you the milkshake guy?

11:02.604 --> 11:03.271
Uh, no.

11:03.304 --> 11:04.104
He's down there.

11:04.138 --> 11:06.837
Getting his ass whupped on!

11:06.870 --> 11:07.670
Is that gonna be long?

11:07.703 --> 11:08.870
All night!

11:08.903 --> 11:09.870
Can I get you something?

11:09.903 --> 11:10.703
No, no.

11:10.737 --> 11:11.602
I'm good.

11:11.636 --> 11:12.569
I'm in the credits.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.502
? F-finger puppets

11:14.536 --> 11:17.535
f-f-finger puppets ?

11:17.568 --> 11:19.935
? F-finger puppets

11:19.968 --> 11:22.967
f-f-f-finger puppets

11:23.000 --> 11:24.167
f-f-finger puppets ?
