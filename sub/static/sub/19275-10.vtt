00:00.061 --> 00:01.895
<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:01.931 --> 00:04.101
Patrick's in the FBI. I followed him,

00:04.136 --> 00:06.841
<i>and then I saw Gina and
Auntie what's-her-face</i>

00:06.876 --> 00:09.407
<i>with their badges dressed
like legit FBI agents.</i>

00:09.442 --> 00:13.273
- It's complicated.
- Or maybe... not complicated.

00:13.891 --> 00:15.325
I slept with Gina.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.544
You bedded an undercover agent?

00:20.432 --> 00:22.732
<i>- That's a saffron.
- Max is telling this story</i>

00:22.768 --> 00:24.901
about this chick he was in love with

00:24.937 --> 00:27.270
<i>and how she betrayed him
and he had to give her up.</i>

00:27.306 --> 00:29.573
<i>He said what? Max and I are going</i>

00:29.608 --> 00:31.241
<i>to teach you everything
you need to know,</i>

00:31.276 --> 00:34.811
<i>and then we take Patrick,
we pay off the Doctor,</i>

00:34.847 --> 00:37.113
and the FBI doesn't
even know what happened.

00:37.149 --> 00:38.982
Let me see the art piece.

00:39.017 --> 00:41.351
I switch out the real money

00:41.386 --> 00:43.520
with the fake money. VoilÃ .

00:43.555 --> 00:45.622
- What do you need?
- Answers.

00:45.657 --> 00:48.158
Don't try to know me, Ezra.
It ain't worth it.

00:48.193 --> 00:50.760
- What's your angle?
- Immunity.

00:50.796 --> 00:53.029
I get you the Doctor,
you get me someplace new

00:53.065 --> 00:55.499
to start over. Max, my right-hand man,

00:55.534 --> 00:57.467
you have to leave him
alone for this to play out.

00:57.503 --> 00:59.636
Maddie tells the Doctor they
found the missing money,

00:59.671 --> 01:01.338
he comes to claim it.

01:01.373 --> 01:03.106
Once he takes the bait,
we've got our man.

01:03.141 --> 01:04.708
This isn't over yet, Max.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.776
<i>I need you to keep up the good work.</i>

01:06.812 --> 01:09.479
Well, of course, Doctor.
I'm your eyes and ears.

01:09.515 --> 01:11.681
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11.717 --> 01:13.717
the Doctor is in.

02:47.245 --> 02:49.613
<i>Let's go.</i>

02:51.283 --> 02:53.783
Morning.

02:53.819 --> 02:56.019
Morning, sweetheart.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.457
Maddie, I need you straight
home from school today.

03:00.492 --> 03:02.492
Your cousin Danny's
coming for the weekend

03:02.527 --> 03:04.995
and I want you to let him in.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.496
But I have a plan with Kelly...

03:06.531 --> 03:08.064
No buts. 3:30 sharp.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.432
Last time Danny was here,

03:09.468 --> 03:11.234
he locked me in the closet for an hour

03:11.269 --> 03:12.981
until I agreed to be his
servant for the rest of the day.

03:13.005 --> 03:16.172
That's not true.
Why do you always exaggerate?

03:17.542 --> 03:19.175
- Dad.
- You were little kids.

03:19.211 --> 03:21.277
He's a very impressive young man.

03:21.313 --> 03:23.113
An all-state wrestler,
he's got a big meet

03:23.148 --> 03:25.448
down in Lancaster this weekend.

03:25.484 --> 03:26.983
But I made this plan, it's imp...

03:27.019 --> 03:29.786
I know, sweetheart.
Now, please, eat your breakfast.

03:29.821 --> 03:32.789
Okay? Most important meal of the day.

03:38.563 --> 03:41.131
You're always bugging me about
doing something together,

03:41.166 --> 03:43.700
so I invite you to hang out after school

03:43.735 --> 03:46.536
and then you ditch me.

03:46.571 --> 03:48.338
I'm really sorry. It's ju...

03:48.373 --> 03:49.550
Forget about your stupid cousin.

03:49.574 --> 03:51.141
He can wait on the porch.

03:51.176 --> 03:54.511
Maddie's a good girl.
She'd never do that.

03:54.546 --> 03:55.901
Would you, Maddie?

03:57.149 --> 04:00.617
I kind of promised my dad.

04:00.652 --> 04:02.886
She promised her dad.

04:08.894 --> 04:11.961
One day you'll have some fun,
Maddie Jonson.

04:11.997 --> 04:13.080
Just not with me.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.174
Who is it?

04:24.209 --> 04:25.842
Ezra.

04:28.380 --> 04:29.405
Come in.

04:30.015 --> 04:31.915
You just getting here? You're late.

04:31.950 --> 04:33.650
For what? Wait.

04:33.685 --> 04:36.486
- Are you getting married today?
- Ha, ha, very funny.

04:36.521 --> 04:38.232
- Did you need something?
- Just checking in.

04:38.256 --> 04:39.489
Wishing you luck.

04:39.524 --> 04:40.857
Luck's got nothing to do with it.

04:40.892 --> 04:42.926
Don't worry. All will be well.

04:42.961 --> 04:45.562
Unless, of course,
you're playing us... again.

04:45.597 --> 04:48.431
Playing me again.

04:50.569 --> 04:52.402
What do you want from me, Ezra?

04:52.437 --> 04:53.437
You know what?

04:54.272 --> 04:57.273
I don't even know anymore.

05:00.445 --> 05:02.612
Would you do me up?

05:02.647 --> 05:04.009
Sure.

05:16.161 --> 05:19.262
My name's Maddie Jonson. No H in Jonson.

05:19.297 --> 05:21.397
I work for a man named the Doctor.

05:21.433 --> 05:24.134
I grew up in Pottsville, Pennsylvania,

05:24.169 --> 05:28.204
<i>and my first con was
my second cousin, Danny.</i>

05:28.240 --> 05:31.760
<i>I was sitting on my bed wishing
I could be somewhere else,</i>

05:32.341 --> 05:34.978
<i>could be someone else.</i>

05:37.349 --> 05:40.150
<i>And then... I just tried it.</i>

05:41.987 --> 05:45.755
Hey, Danny. What's up?

05:45.791 --> 05:48.124
- You are?
- I'm Nikki.

05:49.661 --> 05:51.394
Maddie had some shit to do after school

05:51.429 --> 05:53.963
and asked me to meet you.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.298
Come on in.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.433
Hey, Nikki.

05:57.469 --> 05:59.435
<i>And he believed me.</i>

05:59.471 --> 06:01.271
<i>Just like that.</i>

06:07.045 --> 06:09.646
You're just, stealing their beers?

06:09.681 --> 06:11.314
What are they gonna do...

06:11.349 --> 06:13.183
ground me?

06:13.218 --> 06:14.751
I don't even live here.

06:14.786 --> 06:16.419
Ballsy.

06:16.454 --> 06:18.621
If you think that's ballsy,

06:18.657 --> 06:20.790
your life must be pretty boring.

06:22.494 --> 06:24.160
All right. Give me that beer.

06:33.972 --> 06:35.705
So wrestling is kind of gay, right?

06:35.740 --> 06:37.540
What? No.

06:37.576 --> 06:39.275
That's such a ignorant stereotype.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.022
Wrestling's one of the oldest,
most respected s...

06:41.046 --> 06:44.681
Right, all those Greek
boys rolling around in the mud.

06:44.716 --> 06:45.997
Come on, that's idiotic.

06:45.998 --> 06:48.618
You got a mouth on you, don't you?

06:48.653 --> 06:49.991
Yeah.

06:51.223 --> 06:54.457
So show me a wrestling move.

06:54.492 --> 06:56.492
'Cause I just don't get it.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.327
Not so easy, is it?

07:04.363 --> 07:06.496
It's not so easy.

07:06.532 --> 07:08.031
But not impossible.

07:08.066 --> 07:09.499
Yeah?

07:09.535 --> 07:12.702
But now what're you gonna do?

07:17.009 --> 07:18.708
Holy shit.

07:24.716 --> 07:28.818
Okay, so you've done this before, right?

07:28.854 --> 07:30.353
Does it matter?

07:30.389 --> 07:31.677
Not really.

07:35.861 --> 07:39.696
Pottsville is a lot
different than I remember it.

07:39.731 --> 07:42.432
Must seem pretty boring
after Philadelphia?

07:42.467 --> 07:44.534
I don't know.
The more experienced I get,

07:44.570 --> 07:47.170
the more I realize, you know,
I don't know everything.

07:47.205 --> 07:49.406
- True.
- Well said, well said.

07:49.441 --> 07:51.107
Maddie, dinner's ready.

07:51.143 --> 07:54.344
Sorry. Finishing some math stuff.

07:54.379 --> 07:55.845
Hi, Danny!

07:55.881 --> 07:57.781
I'm sorry I wasn't here to let you in.

07:57.816 --> 08:00.884
- Nikki said you were so nice.
- I thought I said 3:30 sharp.

08:00.919 --> 08:03.553
- And who is Nikki?
- A new friend.

08:03.589 --> 08:05.255
She helped me out.

08:05.290 --> 08:07.724
She said you guys talked
about wrestling a lot.

08:07.759 --> 08:10.727
You even showed her some moves?

08:10.762 --> 08:14.931
Thanks, Mom. I'm totally famished.

08:14.967 --> 08:17.133
<i>And in that moment I knew.</i>

08:17.169 --> 08:19.269
<i>I could be whoever I wanted to be</i>

08:19.304 --> 08:21.237
<i>whenever I wanted to be,</i>

08:21.273 --> 08:23.440
<i>and for the first time, I felt free.</i>

08:23.475 --> 08:24.975
You okay? Eat up.

08:25.010 --> 08:28.078
- Yeah.
- You're gonna need your energy.

08:31.249 --> 08:34.284
And that was the first con.

08:34.318 --> 08:36.820
First of many.

08:36.855 --> 08:41.091
You know, you could have
just become an actress.

08:41.126 --> 08:42.792
Not the same thing.

08:42.828 --> 08:44.794
I was kidding.
I don't really care anymore

08:44.830 --> 08:46.463
about how you became you.

08:46.498 --> 08:48.131
Really? I thought you wanted the truth.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.300
I know the truth.
I know what really gets you off

08:50.335 --> 08:52.068
about being on the con.

08:52.104 --> 08:53.903
Yeah?

08:53.939 --> 08:55.334
Tell me.

08:56.942 --> 08:59.609
See you in the game, Maddie.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.139
<i>- Right down this way, please.
- You got it.</i>

09:08.220 --> 09:09.871
There we go. Thank you.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.121
Good morning, ma'am.
Can I help you with that?

09:13.176 --> 09:14.509
Do I look like I need help?

09:14.544 --> 09:16.644
Just make sure nobody
gets too close to my car.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.812
Yes, ma'am.

09:17.847 --> 09:19.247
What a handsome young man,

09:19.282 --> 09:21.416
but that moustache is not flattering.

09:27.924 --> 09:29.257
<i>Bride or groom?</i>

09:29.292 --> 09:31.159
Great. Gift room's just over there.

09:31.194 --> 09:32.194
Thank you.

09:35.198 --> 09:36.698
Bride or groom?

09:36.733 --> 09:38.344
- Definitely groom.
- If that's a present,

09:38.368 --> 09:40.001
the gift room is just over... nope.

09:40.036 --> 09:41.402
Okay.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.507
So, how we doing?

09:46.543 --> 09:48.443
- I'm amazing.
- I'm guessing this has to be

09:48.478 --> 09:50.011
pretty messed up for you.

09:50.046 --> 09:51.691
Well, you're the one
marrying the woman you love

09:51.715 --> 09:53.848
even though you know
it's total bullshit.

09:53.883 --> 09:56.017
Pretty messed up for the both of us.

09:56.052 --> 09:58.920
- Morning, bride or groom?
- Bride.

10:03.793 --> 10:05.393
Who are all these people?

10:05.428 --> 10:07.295
We hired some background artists.

10:07.330 --> 10:10.198
Try to make it look
legit for the Doctor.

10:10.233 --> 10:11.899
What? Like movie extras.

10:11.935 --> 10:14.068
Good lord. Even fake weddings

10:14.104 --> 10:15.770
are full of ridiculous little games.

10:42.799 --> 10:43.799
Hey.

10:45.502 --> 10:46.801
Hey, listen. I'm really sorry

10:46.836 --> 10:48.114
that we didn't get to talk last night.

10:48.138 --> 10:49.737
It's just, you know,

10:49.773 --> 10:51.606
with my aunt and Ezra,
it's just kind of...

10:51.641 --> 10:52.819
Complicated?

10:53.676 --> 10:56.077
Thought maybe you were avoiding me.

10:56.112 --> 10:57.923
- Which I un... totally understand.
- No, no, no, no.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.658
It was just... it was complicated.
It was just...

10:59.682 --> 11:01.382
I mean, it's wh... like you said.

11:03.486 --> 11:05.520
Wow. It really came together.

11:05.555 --> 11:07.688
Don't sound surprised.
You never even saw it.

11:07.724 --> 11:11.426
I know, but it just kind of...
I mean, you just

11:11.461 --> 11:13.428
really seemed to capture something

11:13.463 --> 11:16.364
<i>about this whole crazy wedding.</i>

11:17.834 --> 11:20.001
Thank you.

11:23.306 --> 11:26.274
All kinds of fun surprises on this case.

11:28.678 --> 11:30.978
- I should go.
- Of course.

11:31.014 --> 11:32.847
See if Patrick needs help with anything.

11:32.882 --> 11:34.849
Yeah, see ya.

11:34.884 --> 11:36.851
See ya.

11:40.690 --> 11:43.224
Is he here yet?

11:43.259 --> 11:44.659
No.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.696
Don't worry. He'll be here.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.700
All right.

11:52.735 --> 11:53.835
Morning, sir.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.441
If you'd like to go ahead and just park

11:55.465 --> 11:57.665
next to that cone over there.
It's a special spot

11:57.701 --> 11:58.833
I have waiting just for you.

11:58.868 --> 12:01.436
Thank you, my man.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.546
Bride or groom?

12:11.581 --> 12:13.114
Definitely bride.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.721
That's him.

12:19.756 --> 12:21.055
There you are.

12:21.819 --> 12:23.458
Well done.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.960
Consider it my wedding present to you,

12:25.996 --> 12:27.862
darling dearest.

12:27.897 --> 12:29.897
That's sweet.

12:29.933 --> 12:33.034
All right, it's about that time.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.603
- Let's work.
- Enjoy the show.

13:56.519 --> 13:58.352
We are gathered here today

13:58.388 --> 14:01.155
to join this woman, Saffron Keyes,

14:01.191 --> 14:03.291
and this man, Patrick Campbell,

14:03.326 --> 14:04.959
in holy matrimony.

14:04.994 --> 14:07.228
<i>It is a blessed way of life</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.197
<i>that all should hold in reverence</i>

14:09.232 --> 14:11.232
<i>and none should take lightly.</i>

14:13.002 --> 14:16.170
<i>A covenant by which two people establish</i>

14:16.206 --> 14:18.239
<i>between themselves a partnership</i>

14:19.207 --> 14:20.908
<i>for the whole of life,</i>

14:20.944 --> 14:24.345
<i>based on love, devotion, and trust.</i>

14:27.851 --> 14:29.422
And interruptions.

14:31.321 --> 14:33.020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:33.056 --> 14:36.691
A good partnership can handle

14:36.726 --> 14:39.393
an annoying interruption.

14:42.411 --> 14:43.994
There we go.

14:44.482 --> 14:46.830
Come on. Okay.

14:53.672 --> 14:56.006
Come on. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

15:01.647 --> 15:04.014
- Everything okay here?
- Yes.

15:04.049 --> 15:07.084
Yeah, these new models
are sensitive to changes

15:07.119 --> 15:10.988
in the barometric st... and whatnot,

15:11.023 --> 15:14.725
but, yeah,
reset itself, so all clear.

15:16.529 --> 15:18.428
Dig the moustache.

15:18.464 --> 15:21.265
Very cool.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.700
Thank you.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.503
<i>What a miracle</i>

15:26.539 --> 15:30.207
when two people find
each other in this world,

15:30.242 --> 15:32.643
when seemingly from nothing,

15:32.678 --> 15:35.812
love sprouts like a little seedling

15:35.848 --> 15:38.282
stretching for the sun.

15:38.317 --> 15:40.617
So what is your real name anyways?

15:40.653 --> 15:42.519
It's actually Patrick.

15:42.555 --> 15:44.278
Not Campbell, though, right?

15:45.891 --> 15:48.358
So many questions, so few answers,

15:49.342 --> 15:52.162
and you thought I was
hard to get to know.

15:52.198 --> 15:54.398
Isn't it all so incredible?

15:54.913 --> 15:56.366
Well, I think so.

15:56.402 --> 15:59.403
An exhilarating affirmation

15:59.438 --> 16:03.507
of both our faith and
our common humanity.

16:03.542 --> 16:07.311
Well, time to get down
to the business at hand.

16:07.346 --> 16:09.479
If anyone present knows a reason

16:09.515 --> 16:12.316
why Saffron and Patrick
may not lawfully marry,

16:12.351 --> 16:15.219
they must declare it now or
forever hold their peace.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.189
Will you,

16:19.225 --> 16:21.758
Saffron Keyes,

16:21.794 --> 16:25.329
give yourself to this man,
Patrick Campbell,

16:25.364 --> 16:27.698
to be his wife,

16:27.733 --> 16:31.401
to love and comfort him,
honor and protect him,

16:31.437 --> 16:33.737
so long as you both shall live?

16:33.772 --> 16:35.005
I will.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.608
And will you, Patrick Campbell,

16:37.643 --> 16:41.411
give yourself to this woman,
Saffron Keyes,

16:41.447 --> 16:43.847
to be her husband,

16:43.882 --> 16:47.551
to love and comfort her,
to honor and protect her,

16:47.586 --> 16:49.553
so long as you both shall live?

16:49.588 --> 16:52.456
- I surely will.
- Wonderful.

16:52.491 --> 16:57.961
And so, by the power vested in me
by the State of Washington,

16:57.997 --> 17:00.063
I now pronounce you

17:00.099 --> 17:02.399
husband and wife.

17:20.719 --> 17:22.618
- Vodka rocks.
- Thank you so much for coming.

17:25.324 --> 17:28.392
I think I forgot to tell you
how beautiful you look today.

17:28.426 --> 17:30.160
Truly.

17:30.195 --> 17:31.628
Thank you so much for being here.

17:31.664 --> 17:32.698
Thank you for coming.

17:32.699 --> 17:36.266
And I think I forgot to ask you
if you were married...

17:36.302 --> 17:37.479
to someone other than me that is.

17:37.503 --> 17:38.802
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

17:38.837 --> 17:40.337
Thank you so much for being here.

17:41.531 --> 17:42.531
Interesting.

17:42.725 --> 17:43.507
Auntie!

17:43.542 --> 17:47.778
Hi! Thank you so much for being here

17:47.813 --> 17:49.680
on our special day.

17:49.715 --> 17:51.348
Laying it on thick, aren't you?

17:51.383 --> 17:54.685
Well, the Doctor expects
me to put on a good show.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.020
He also likes you to pick out
stupid-ass names too?

17:57.056 --> 17:58.281
Auntie, what a special...

17:58.316 --> 17:59.474
Spare me.

18:01.337 --> 18:02.642
What about kids?

18:02.677 --> 18:04.222
Hello, thank you so much for being here.

18:04.246 --> 18:06.579
I didn't say I was married.

18:06.615 --> 18:07.914
Didn't say you weren't.

18:07.949 --> 18:09.249
Squabbling already?

18:09.284 --> 18:11.317
Hi.

18:11.353 --> 18:13.086
You know, of all my nieces and nephews,

18:13.121 --> 18:15.188
- Saffron was always my favorite.
- Aww.

18:15.223 --> 18:17.557
Honey, this is my uncle, Albert.

18:17.592 --> 18:19.926
Wow. Heard a lot about you.

18:19.961 --> 18:21.130
We're glad you could make it.

18:22.130 --> 18:23.530
Treat her well.

18:23.565 --> 18:25.198
Or else you'll have to answer to me,

18:25.233 --> 18:27.867
and that's not something
you want on your calendar.

18:27.903 --> 18:32.872
Well, I think I can handle you,
Uncle Albert.

18:35.477 --> 18:37.043
Good choice. I like him.

18:37.078 --> 18:38.589
Well, I'll see you on the dance floor.

18:38.613 --> 18:40.713
Yes, you will.

18:40.749 --> 18:42.382
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.684
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you for coming.

18:59.901 --> 19:02.435
<i>- It was beautiful though.
- Gina.</i>

19:02.470 --> 19:03.603
<i>- It was...
- There's a bogey</i>

19:03.638 --> 19:04.704
<i>in the money room.</i>

19:04.739 --> 19:06.105
<i>Your old friend is back.</i>

19:06.141 --> 19:07.807
- Copy that.
- You good?

19:07.843 --> 19:10.243
I gotta check on something.

19:24.025 --> 19:25.658
I always hated weddings.

19:27.462 --> 19:31.064
Not the Cinderella/
Prince Charming type?

19:31.099 --> 19:32.398
Exactly.

19:32.434 --> 19:34.334
I always liked those
little birds that helped

19:34.369 --> 19:36.569
with the laundry though.

19:36.605 --> 19:38.838
Hey, come here.

19:45.847 --> 19:48.481
Sorry I was weird before.

19:48.516 --> 19:51.651
I just... don't know what we're doing,

19:51.686 --> 19:54.954
and I mean,
I don't wanna get you in trouble

19:54.990 --> 19:57.924
with your boyfriend.

19:57.959 --> 20:00.793
Well, I don't wanna get you
in trouble with your Auntie.

20:00.829 --> 20:03.696
- No, she's harmless.
- Sure about that?

20:03.732 --> 20:04.964
I am sure about that.

20:09.838 --> 20:11.371
<i>Gina, what's going on?</i>

20:11.406 --> 20:13.006
<i>- Gina, you have a fire.
- My God!</i>

20:13.041 --> 20:14.440
Shit, is this part of your art?

20:14.476 --> 20:16.142
- No, shit!
- Secure the money!

20:16.177 --> 20:17.410
<i>Go get something, quick.
Just get something!</i>

20:17.411 --> 20:18.140
- Jesus!
- Shit.

20:18.141 --> 20:20.380
- Okay, hold on, hold on!
- Hold on?

20:27.058 --> 20:29.560
Gina, I can't see anything.
Do something about this fire.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.295
<i>Gina, where are you?</i>

20:31.330 --> 20:32.796
<i>She's headed for the briefcase.</i>

20:34.559 --> 20:35.693
Where the hell'd you go?

20:37.212 --> 20:38.511
I got it, I got it! Look out!

20:38.547 --> 20:40.280
My God!

20:40.315 --> 20:42.682
My God, you're ruining it!
You're ruining it!

20:45.654 --> 20:47.320
<i>It's out, it's done.</i>

20:47.356 --> 20:48.888
<i>We're okay.</i>

20:48.924 --> 20:50.657
Where's the briefcase?

21:00.836 --> 21:04.504
I'm really sorry.
It was just... it was...

21:04.539 --> 21:06.406
it was on fire.

21:06.441 --> 21:08.308
Hey... hey, maybe it's cool like this.

21:08.343 --> 21:12.879
I mean, maybe Patrick and Saffron are...

21:12.914 --> 21:14.914
water signs.

21:14.950 --> 21:17.417
No. You ruined it.

21:17.452 --> 21:18.712
It's ruined.

21:22.287 --> 21:24.487
What can I say?
Ever since I was a little girl,

21:24.523 --> 21:25.922
I always dreamed about it.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.424
A traditional wedding.

21:27.459 --> 21:29.292
Well, you only get married once.

21:29.695 --> 21:31.461
Knock on wood.

21:31.496 --> 21:33.863
So what do you think
of your new brother-in-law?

21:33.899 --> 21:35.465
We're still getting to know each other.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.334
Excuse me.

21:37.369 --> 21:39.169
I know how you feel. In my family,

21:39.204 --> 21:40.782
we call them the out-laws,
not the in-laws.

21:40.806 --> 21:41.972
- Right.
- Yeah.

21:42.007 --> 21:42.973
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:43.008 --> 21:45.342
- Hi.
- You got a sec?

21:45.377 --> 21:46.876
Yeah, sure. What is it?

21:46.912 --> 21:49.145
Not here. Come on.

21:52.558 --> 21:54.191
- Okay...
- No, don't to...

21:54.226 --> 21:55.570
- Just don't touch it!
- All right, I just wanna

21:55.594 --> 21:57.172
help you get it to the...
Okay, are you sure

21:57.196 --> 21:58.962
that you have to throw this out?

21:58.997 --> 22:01.465
- I mean, maybe we can...
- I don't want to talk about it!

22:01.500 --> 22:03.467
I'm sorry.

22:03.502 --> 22:05.402
So what...
so does destroying your art...

22:05.437 --> 22:08.071
What, does it like disqualify
me from being with you again?

22:08.106 --> 22:09.898
I liked our lunch...

22:10.709 --> 22:13.034
And our after lunch a lot.

22:13.069 --> 22:14.377
I'm just really not in a place

22:14.413 --> 22:16.980
- to trust my feelings right now.
- What does that mean?

22:17.015 --> 22:20.484
<i>That means no one ever seems
to be who they say they are.</i>

22:20.519 --> 22:22.319
<i>Everyone is hiding something</i>

22:22.354 --> 22:24.588
<i>or pretending to be
something they're not.</i>

22:24.623 --> 22:26.056
Are you talking about Ezra?

22:26.091 --> 22:29.092
No, I mean everyone. Including me.

22:29.127 --> 22:31.828
It's just all one big projection.

22:31.864 --> 22:34.164
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

22:34.199 --> 22:35.899
Okay.

22:35.934 --> 22:37.701
I need you to be someone,

22:37.736 --> 22:40.270
so I pretend to be the person
I think you need me to be

22:40.305 --> 22:42.072
so hopefully you're
willing to be the person

22:42.107 --> 22:44.774
I think I need you to be.
But what if what I think I need

22:44.810 --> 22:46.376
isn't what I actually need? Then what?

22:46.411 --> 22:48.022
Maybe you should just
go with what you want.

22:48.046 --> 22:49.446
But what if I don't even know...

22:55.888 --> 22:58.588
- Do you want that?
- Pretty sure I do, yeah.

22:58.624 --> 23:01.291
So maybe it is just that simple.

23:04.096 --> 23:05.396
Maybe.

23:07.266 --> 23:09.299
Or maybe not.

23:15.574 --> 23:17.240
So what is it?

23:17.276 --> 23:18.853
We weren't supposed
to leave the reception

23:18.877 --> 23:21.278
until after 2:00. That was the plan.

23:21.313 --> 23:23.747
I know.

23:24.983 --> 23:27.117
How you doing, Ez?

23:27.152 --> 23:28.225
That's it?

23:28.620 --> 23:30.587
Yeah, I'm fine. You?

23:30.622 --> 23:31.788
- Great.
- Great.

23:31.823 --> 23:33.323
Great.

23:34.493 --> 23:36.226
I wanna hear you say it.

23:36.261 --> 23:39.095
That thing you were
about to say earlier.

23:39.131 --> 23:42.132
The thing that really gets me off.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.905
It really doesn't matter.

23:47.306 --> 23:48.881
I wanna hear it.

23:51.476 --> 23:52.943
Okay.

23:52.978 --> 23:55.912
When you left me,

23:55.948 --> 24:00.016
I was finally forced out
of my safe little bubble

24:00.052 --> 24:03.787
and I had to become a different...

24:03.822 --> 24:05.655
version of me.

24:05.691 --> 24:08.091
Are you thanking me for
turning you into a con man?

24:08.126 --> 24:10.119
No, you didn't turn me into anything.

24:12.531 --> 24:14.698
We hit the road,
we were living on the grift,

24:14.733 --> 24:18.301
and, yeah, it was kind of amazing,

24:18.337 --> 24:19.589
and I thought...

24:21.006 --> 24:23.673
"Yeah, this is what gets Maddie off.

24:23.709 --> 24:27.344
This... this rush,
this is the feeling she lives for."

24:27.379 --> 24:31.648
And then I found you and I
realized I was way wrong.

24:31.683 --> 24:34.293
It's not the con that gets you off.

24:34.611 --> 24:35.828
What is it then?

24:36.314 --> 24:38.888
Being loved by someone,

24:38.924 --> 24:40.724
but not having to love them back.

24:40.759 --> 24:45.161
Getting in deep,
but not having to stick around.

24:45.197 --> 24:47.697
I mean, come on.
You almost got to love Patrick.

24:47.733 --> 24:49.833
You almost got to love me.

24:49.868 --> 24:51.201
Bullshit.

24:51.236 --> 24:53.403
You're not tortured.

24:53.438 --> 24:54.482
You're just scared.

24:55.273 --> 24:57.641
- I'm scared?
- Petrified.

24:57.676 --> 24:59.909
Because in real life,

24:59.945 --> 25:02.245
if you want to feel something,

25:02.280 --> 25:04.180
you have to go all the way,

25:04.216 --> 25:08.218
and some people are just
not cut out for that.

25:09.975 --> 25:11.908
You really wanna know what I think?

25:11.944 --> 25:14.177
No matter what you do, where you go,

25:14.213 --> 25:17.647
who you con, who you become,

25:17.683 --> 25:20.784
end of the day,
you're just that same little girl

25:20.819 --> 25:23.120
sitting in her room

25:23.155 --> 25:24.988
in Pottsville

25:25.023 --> 25:27.991
pretending.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.927
You don't know me.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.295
No?

25:47.312 --> 25:49.713
He's on the move.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.901
The Doctor's on the move.
Stand by for the money grab.

26:14.595 --> 26:15.595
All right.

26:15.933 --> 26:16.933
Okay.

26:19.678 --> 26:20.877
Come on.

26:22.031 --> 26:23.280
<i>Come on.</i>

26:29.254 --> 26:31.988
- Almost there.
- I see it, I see it.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.224
<i>Here we go.</i>

26:35.710 --> 26:36.460
What's he doing? Where's he going?

26:36.495 --> 26:38.339
- I d... he didn't take the money.
- I can see that.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.974
What do we do now?
We go after him, right?

26:39.998 --> 26:42.265
No, we cannot do anything
until he picks it up.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.667
<i>The Doctor's left the building.</i>

26:43.702 --> 26:44.734
Shit!

26:44.770 --> 26:46.570
He didn't take the briefcase?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.138
<i>He just walked off.</i>

26:51.076 --> 26:52.542
All set, Doctor.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.578
You did good, kiddo.

26:54.613 --> 26:57.547
I'll see you at the rendezvous.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.583
- See you there.
- Yep.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.520
Send three teams to follow his car
until I say make a move.

27:03.555 --> 27:06.223
I'll find Maddie and find out
what the hell is going on.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.258
Copy that.

27:11.797 --> 27:13.763
All right, all agents,
it's time to mount up.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.510
<i>Follow the Doctor.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.</i>

27:15.534 --> 27:16.569
<i>Go, go.</i>

27:17.135 --> 27:18.602
What's going on?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.914
Every car is dead? Are you kidding me?

27:19.938 --> 27:21.204
It's dead. Look.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.906
<i>Where's the valet guy?</i>

27:22.941 --> 27:24.608
What's going on? It's dead!

27:24.643 --> 27:26.622
Yeah, it won't start. It's dead.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.379
Let's go! What're you doing?

27:29.414 --> 27:31.014
I don't know. It's not working.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.283
Please don't tell me
these cars are dead.

27:49.731 --> 27:51.497
What the hell are you doing, man?

27:51.532 --> 27:53.210
- Keeping an eye on the mark.
- Why is the Doctor leaving

27:53.234 --> 27:54.600
- without the money?
- What?

27:54.636 --> 27:56.369
We are officially in
uncharted territory.

27:56.404 --> 27:57.837
- Our deal is off.
- Hey, what deal?

27:57.872 --> 27:59.550
- I thought we had a deal.
- Shut your mouth.

27:59.574 --> 28:01.085
You're going to jail if
this is some kind of...

28:01.109 --> 28:02.575
Wait, did you play me?

28:02.610 --> 28:04.042
I don't believe it. You played me?

28:04.043 --> 28:05.723
Ezra, I suggest you calm down.
You are interfering...

28:05.747 --> 28:07.358
So I kissed your wife.
Well, you know what?

28:07.382 --> 28:10.750
- She used to be my wife.
- Just shut your mouth.

28:10.785 --> 28:13.519
Ezra, I have you, and I have Maddie too.

28:13.554 --> 28:15.121
- Don't play with me.
- Really?

28:15.156 --> 28:17.356
You sure about that?

28:19.327 --> 28:21.060
- Shit.
- Where you going?

28:21.095 --> 28:24.063
Get the f... out of my way.

28:42.150 --> 28:43.616
Shit.

28:51.626 --> 28:54.527
Maddie! Don't do this!

29:04.138 --> 29:06.272
This is Agent Simons. Arrest the Doctor.

29:06.307 --> 29:08.808
I don't care if he's got the
money or not... just stop him.

29:08.843 --> 29:10.743
Maddie's on a boat headed southeast.

29:10.778 --> 29:12.945
Have Seattle PD check
every dock and marina

29:12.980 --> 29:14.213
on the southeast side...

29:19.821 --> 29:22.955
<i>He's driving a black Cadillac CTS,
Washington plates.</i>

29:22.990 --> 29:26.459
<i>Suspect is, bald,
wearing glasses, dark suit.</i>

29:26.494 --> 29:29.743
<i>- They're on the way.
- Order 12... I don't care!</i>

29:29.778 --> 29:31.098
Just get us the hell out of here!

29:31.732 --> 29:33.199
Agent Simons!

29:33.936 --> 29:35.334
Simons!

29:35.369 --> 29:37.737
It absolutely has to be back by 6:30

29:37.772 --> 29:39.472
- for Seniors Bingo.
- Seniors Bingo.

29:39.507 --> 29:40.706
Got it!

29:42.677 --> 29:44.117
<i>Just get to the highway interchange.</i>

29:44.145 --> 29:45.523
Seattle PD's looking for his car.

29:45.524 --> 29:46.933
They're gonna let us
know which way to go.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.814
Damn weddings.

29:52.386 --> 29:53.486
What's that?

29:58.693 --> 30:01.327
<i>Hello, Patrick.</i>

30:01.362 --> 30:04.897
<i>This must be very confusing for you.</i>

30:04.932 --> 30:06.565
<i>We had a deal.</i>

30:06.601 --> 30:09.168
<i>I even signed a contract.</i>

30:09.203 --> 30:12.571
<i>But a lot of people make promises</i>

30:12.607 --> 30:14.707
<i>they never intend to keep,</i>

30:14.742 --> 30:15.808
<i>right?</i>

30:19.547 --> 30:22.181
<i>There's really no easy way to say this,</i>

30:22.216 --> 30:24.316
<i>so here it is.</i>

30:24.352 --> 30:27.553
<i>Patrick, you are never
going to catch me.</i>

30:31.626 --> 30:34.827
<i>You're never gonna find me.</i>

30:39.400 --> 30:43.369
<i>In fact, you will never see me again.</i>

30:46.474 --> 30:49.775
<i>You're gonna ask yourself many
questions in the days ahead.</i>

30:49.811 --> 30:52.845
<i>You'll replay every moment
we shared together.</i>

30:52.880 --> 30:55.447
<i>This work can mess with
your head and you heart.</i>

30:55.483 --> 30:57.783
<i>Wondering how did you let this happen?</i>

30:57.819 --> 30:59.718
- Yeah, cheers, bro.
- Game time.

30:59.754 --> 31:01.754
<i>What clues did you miss?</i>

31:01.789 --> 31:03.722
- I got you.
- You have a deal.

31:03.758 --> 31:05.357
<i>What could you have done differently?</i>

31:05.393 --> 31:07.560
I talked to the Doctor today.
He's coming.

31:07.595 --> 31:09.562
<i>He's gonna be at the
wedding to get his money.</i>

31:09.597 --> 31:11.297
You know, of all my nieces and nephews,

31:11.332 --> 31:12.615
Saffron was always my favorite.

31:12.616 --> 31:15.134
<i>You'll feel many different emotions...</i>

31:15.169 --> 31:16.202
<i>anger...</i>

31:16.237 --> 31:19.805
<i>humiliation... doubt.</i>

31:19.841 --> 31:22.274
<i>But really, the sooner you accept it,</i>

31:22.310 --> 31:23.943
<i>the better it is for everyone.</i>

31:24.505 --> 31:26.245
<i>Although something tells me,</i>

31:26.280 --> 31:29.815
<i>all you're gonna be thinking
about is trying to find me.</i>

31:33.321 --> 31:35.921
Roll it down. Hands on the wheel.

31:35.957 --> 31:38.224
Real slow now. License and registration.

31:38.259 --> 31:40.326
Everything all right, officer?

31:50.504 --> 31:54.006
Sorry there, sir. Have a nice day.

31:54.041 --> 31:56.675
I most certainly will.

32:13.027 --> 32:15.761
Hey, have you seen
a woman in a wedding dress?

32:15.796 --> 32:17.196
I don't know.

32:17.231 --> 32:19.798
Are one of you cuties the groom?

32:23.237 --> 32:25.371
<i>You know, I used to think
we were the same,</i>

32:25.406 --> 32:28.007
<i>you and I, in a way.</i>

32:28.042 --> 32:32.044
<i>Maybe that's why I started
to feel how I felt about you.</i>

32:32.079 --> 32:34.713
<i>Maybe that's why I thought
you might actually want</i>

32:34.749 --> 32:36.715
<i>to run away together.</i>

32:36.751 --> 32:38.978
<i>You know, like we talked about.</i>

32:39.940 --> 32:43.822
<i>But then I ultimately realized
this was just a game for you.</i>

32:43.858 --> 32:47.693
<i>So what I needed from you...</i>

32:47.728 --> 32:50.129
<i>I took.</i>

32:50.164 --> 32:52.798
<i>Good-bye, Patrick.</i>

32:52.833 --> 32:56.302
<i>I wish you luck.</i>

32:56.337 --> 32:59.004
<i>You're gonna need it.</i>

33:04.879 --> 33:06.278
Wow.

33:07.515 --> 33:10.282
Play it again.

33:32.155 --> 33:33.435
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Thank you.

33:43.701 --> 33:44.728
It has to be said,

33:44.729 --> 33:46.224
- that was...
- Awesome.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.280
- Totally...
- Completely.

33:48.281 --> 33:49.554
Awesome.

33:50.700 --> 33:53.168
Although, seeing her
walk down that aisle again...

33:53.263 --> 33:55.296
Yeah, that was... something.

33:55.332 --> 33:58.299
Yeah. Does anybody else feel
like no matter what we do,

33:58.335 --> 34:00.869
where we go, we'll always
be married to that woman?

34:00.904 --> 34:03.018
Till death do us part.

34:05.442 --> 34:07.208
What time does the bus leave?

34:07.244 --> 34:09.310
40 minutes.

34:09.346 --> 34:10.645
I'll get the tickets?

34:10.679 --> 34:12.447
Yeah. Get five, all right?

34:16.186 --> 34:18.018
Five tickets. Got it.

34:37.808 --> 34:39.774
I'm gonna open this suitcase now,

34:39.810 --> 34:43.110
and you'd better pray all the
government's money is inside.

34:43.146 --> 34:45.513
Maddie, the bumblers
are at the bus station.

34:45.549 --> 34:47.181
I have the case.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.951
Get the ring and get to
the rendezvous point, okay?

34:49.985 --> 34:51.953
Let's get rid of these
amateurs once and for all.

35:29.359 --> 35:31.559
I don't get it.
What the hell is going on?

35:33.981 --> 35:36.781
_

35:50.547 --> 35:53.214
Agent, would you please tell me

35:53.250 --> 35:57.497
where that ridiculously expensive ring
that you gave that woman is?

35:59.055 --> 36:01.856
<i>It's safe. I promise you.</i>

36:01.892 --> 36:04.325
She may be in the wind,

36:04.361 --> 36:07.061
<i>but we have the money...</i>

36:07.097 --> 36:09.230
and the ring is safe.

36:16.540 --> 36:20.108
<i>Your attention, please.
Bus 43 to San Francisco</i>

36:20.143 --> 36:23.945
<i>will be arriving in 30 minutes.</i>

36:23.980 --> 36:26.948
<i>43 to San Francisco in 30 minutes.</i>

36:28.585 --> 36:30.051
<i>Bus 533 to...</i>

36:30.086 --> 36:32.020
<i>- F... it.
- Leaving in 10 minutes.</i>

36:37.160 --> 36:40.195
<i>Now boarding, bus 124 to...</i>

36:40.230 --> 36:41.863
<i>The Seattle Department of Transportation</i>

36:41.898 --> 36:44.032
<i>did submit recommendations
for a traffic plan</i>

36:44.067 --> 36:46.901
<i>to a spokesperson,
they were unaware of the actual result.</i>

36:46.937 --> 36:50.038
<i>The crash on Monday that shut
down I-5 for about eight hours</i>

36:50.073 --> 36:51.973
<i>and forced drivers onto surface streets</i>

36:52.008 --> 36:54.809
<i>was a frustrating reminder
of just how close Seattle is</i>

36:54.844 --> 36:58.279
<i>to complete gridlock on a daily basis.</i>

36:58.315 --> 37:00.315
Today felt so good.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.695
We really did something...

37:03.730 --> 37:06.865
and we did it all for her. Again.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.233
Again, again, again.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.436
Not me. I did it for us.

37:11.471 --> 37:14.939
- For us right here.
- Richie, really?

37:14.975 --> 37:17.308
That's what I'm telling
myself in this moment.

37:17.344 --> 37:19.010
So, yeah, let's just go with it.

37:19.046 --> 37:20.779
- Gotcha.
- Okay, yeah, sounds good, man.

37:20.814 --> 37:21.980
Yeah.

37:22.015 --> 37:23.314
This is on me, guys.

37:23.350 --> 37:24.350
I thought...

37:25.419 --> 37:27.218
I really believed her.

37:27.254 --> 37:29.721
I always believe her. We all do.

37:29.756 --> 37:31.589
Because we want to.

37:31.625 --> 37:34.059
I don't think she was
ever planning on coming.

37:34.094 --> 37:36.494
I think her plan was to take
the money and the ring herself

37:36.530 --> 37:39.064
- and cut us loose.
- Could she really be so...

37:39.099 --> 37:40.799
Smart play, right?

37:40.834 --> 37:43.635
Money, ring, cut us loose.

37:43.670 --> 37:47.338
What'd we expect?
Leopard can't change its pants.

37:47.374 --> 37:50.275
Um, yeah, I'm pretty sure it's...

37:50.310 --> 37:54.345
Right, and she always wanted to be free.

37:54.381 --> 37:56.014
Hey, so did we.

37:56.049 --> 37:58.850
- And we're free?
- You're free of Alice.

37:58.885 --> 38:01.319
Hey, you did all of this without
an ounce of help from Alice.

38:01.354 --> 38:02.854
Think about that.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.056
<i>A moderately powerful storm was...</i>

38:09.062 --> 38:10.505
Look, here's the thing, guys.

38:10.506 --> 38:12.008
We have actually gotten
pretty good at this, you know?

38:12.032 --> 38:14.065
Man, I have always been good at this.

38:14.101 --> 38:15.611
Remember when I showed up at your house

38:15.635 --> 38:17.313
with that FBI badge
and totally fooled you?

38:17.337 --> 38:19.337
Yeah, yeah,
and I saw right through your ruse

38:19.372 --> 38:21.717
- and punched you in the face?
- You mean you sucker punched me

38:21.741 --> 38:23.186
after I pinned your ass to the ground.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.944
Well, yeah.
Well, you insulted my... our wife.

38:25.979 --> 38:28.046
- What do you expect?
- Yeah, and remember

38:28.081 --> 38:30.281
when I made more money than
you mooks did in two weeks

38:30.317 --> 38:31.950
by throwing myself in front of a car?

38:31.985 --> 38:33.852
Do you remember that?

38:33.887 --> 38:35.698
- Doesn't really ring any bells.
- No, I don't remember...!

38:35.722 --> 38:38.189
- That was pretty good.
- Yeah, that was pretty good.

38:38.225 --> 38:40.024
So, you know, I just...
I don't know, guys.

38:40.060 --> 38:42.327
I just got a feeling.
I think we're gonna be okay.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.829
- I don't feel okay.
- Yeah, I'm not sure I buy that.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.036
Why are you smiling like an idiot?

38:52.072 --> 38:53.638
What?

38:53.673 --> 38:55.473
Dude, there's something on your...

38:55.509 --> 38:57.019
- Wait, no, no, wait, wait...
- Is it... where... it's in my hair?

38:57.043 --> 38:59.577
- What is it?
- I got it.

38:59.613 --> 39:01.713
My God. My God!

39:01.748 --> 39:04.549
Shh!

39:04.584 --> 39:06.184
- How?
- How did you...

39:06.219 --> 39:07.485
What did you do?

39:07.521 --> 39:11.322
I... got an early start on the day.

39:15.661 --> 39:17.362
<i>While everyone was heading to church,</i>

39:17.397 --> 39:19.531
<i>I went to Patrick's house</i>

39:19.566 --> 39:22.000
<i>and did a little exploring.</i>

39:31.144 --> 39:34.078
<i>My God, you fool them all!</i>

39:34.114 --> 39:36.281
<i>The frigging FBI, Maddie, Max...</i>

39:38.943 --> 39:41.219
Crazy genius.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.354
Okay, you know what?
You deserve to wear this.

39:43.390 --> 39:44.867
- Really, you sure?
- Yep, it suits you.

39:44.891 --> 39:46.457
Thank you, it means a lot.

39:46.493 --> 39:48.526
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
we are about to depart.</i>

39:48.562 --> 39:50.228
<i>Next stop, Tacoma.</i>

39:50.263 --> 39:51.970
<i>Last stop, San Francisco.</i>

39:54.834 --> 39:56.634
Always forward.

39:56.670 --> 39:58.251
Never back.

40:24.761 --> 40:27.195
<i>No, no, I'm not asking for excuses.</i>

40:27.231 --> 40:29.264
<i>Just answer the question.</i>

40:29.299 --> 40:30.932
Why am I here?

40:30.968 --> 40:33.435
Because I'm not doing my job.

40:33.470 --> 40:37.305
Because you're not doing your job.

40:40.844 --> 40:42.344
Excuse me.

40:42.379 --> 40:45.113
I gotta take this. It's the office.

40:45.148 --> 40:46.915
What's up, Doc?

40:46.950 --> 40:49.217
<i>It seems we have a situation in Seattle.</i>

40:49.253 --> 40:52.153
