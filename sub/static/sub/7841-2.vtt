The Wall street journal
is better than ever

01:56.583 --> 01:58.197
Did you bring the milk ?

02:08.071 --> 02:09.979
This concludes our service.

02:10.186 --> 02:11.588
Go now in the peace

02:11.589 --> 02:12.513
of the Lord.

02:12.514 --> 02:13.923
So long, suckers!

02:13.984 --> 02:14.700
Move it, move it,

02:14.701 --> 02:15.106
move it!

02:15.155 --> 02:16.148
Do you want to be second

02:16.145 --> 02:17.240
out of the parking lot?

02:17.242 --> 02:17.796
Do you?

02:19.091 --> 02:19.643
Leave her!

02:19.640 --> 02:20.636
We left her last week,

02:20.639 --> 02:22.500
and she didn't make
it home for dinner!

02:24.585 --> 02:26.063
You'll never catch me, Lord!

02:27.836 --> 02:29.171
Oh, man, that church

02:29.178 --> 02:31.101
service was so boring.

02:31.108 --> 02:32.301
I did a whole book

02:32.308 --> 02:33.473
of Find-A-Words.

02:34.256 --> 02:35.520
Dad, all you circled

02:35.528 --> 02:37.232
were the "I"s and "A"s.

02:37.236 --> 02:38.100
Those are words.

02:38.108 --> 02:39.950
Well, where should
we go for brunch?

02:39.957 --> 02:41.223
Griddler on the Roof?

02:41.476 --> 02:43.442
Thank God
It's Fried Eggs?

02:43.487 --> 02:44.813
Luftwaffle's?

02:44.815 --> 02:46.373
Bodacious Frittatas?

02:46.378 --> 02:47.982
Buffet the Hunger Slayer?

02:47.986 --> 02:49.023
I want to say one.

02:49.025 --> 02:50.280
Be my guest.

02:50.488 --> 02:51.522
Denny's.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.722
Every place has
such a long line.

02:54.735 --> 02:55.441
Don't worry.

02:55.447 --> 02:56.552
We'll just go home.

02:56.556 --> 02:57.602
Your mother can cook.

02:57.698 --> 02:59.492
I just want a simple salad

02:59.497 --> 03:00.583
with pine nuts,

03:00.598 --> 03:01.560
haricots verts,

03:01.565 --> 03:03.272
seasonal heirloom tomatoes...

03:03.275 --> 03:04.201
Forget it!

03:04.208 --> 03:05.720
One day a week, I should be able

03:05.726 --> 03:06.941
to put on nice clothes and

03:06.947 --> 03:08.910
have someone bring food to me.

03:08.996 --> 03:09.960
There's a place...

03:09.967 --> 03:11.061
with no line!

03:11.367 --> 03:12.470
Woo-hoo!

03:14.935 --> 03:16.402
Bart, that's not a restaurant,

03:16.407 --> 03:17.713
it's somebody's house.

03:17.717 --> 03:18.823
Lisa's right, son.

03:18.826 --> 03:20.402
Your mom is way too classy

03:20.406 --> 03:21.740
a lady to crash a private...

03:21.747 --> 03:23.371
I'm not cooking!

03:24.757 --> 03:26.622
And you can cut
your own meat!

03:31.076 --> 03:33.030
Everyone just act cool.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.042
If anyone asks, tell
them we're plumbers,

03:35.047 --> 03:37.273
and then start plumbing
until they go away.

03:37.275 --> 03:38.683
Hi...

03:38.958 --> 03:39.800
you!

03:39.815 --> 03:42.810
Dude! You don't think,
you know me, but you do!

03:45.928 --> 03:48.630
Oh Homer, you've got to try
this roast beef au jus.

03:50.115 --> 03:52.012
Mmm! Au jus!

03:52.015 --> 03:53.263
Not quite gravy,

03:53.266 --> 03:54.571
not quite blood.

03:54.578 --> 03:56.313
Look at the crowd
around that table!

03:56.825 --> 03:59.171
It must be a make-
your-own sundae bar!

03:59.305 --> 04:00.272
Watch it.

04:00.275 --> 04:01.241
Oh, I can't wait to

04:01.248 --> 04:02.552
taste that hot fudge,

04:02.557 --> 04:04.690
and caramel and crushed nuts

04:04.698 --> 04:07.023
all slathered over a delicious...

04:07.026 --> 04:08.393
elderly corpse?!

04:09.035 --> 04:10.900
We crashed a funeral!

04:10.905 --> 04:11.981
Oh, my God!

04:11.985 --> 04:12.823
Quick, everyone,

04:12.825 --> 04:14.500
put on their long faces.

04:15.916 --> 04:17.051
Longer!

04:21.687 --> 04:23.213
We should get out of here.

04:23.227 --> 04:24.231
Come on!

04:26.008 --> 04:27.502
Where's Bart?

04:28.405 --> 04:29.243
Mahogany.

04:29.245 --> 04:29.943
Great movie,

04:29.948 --> 04:30.751
great casket.

04:30.806 --> 04:32.730
I miss my Pop-pop.

04:32.736 --> 04:34.140
I miss him, too.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.120
What's your name?

04:35.126 --> 04:35.992
Donny.

04:35.995 --> 04:37.331
You're Donny?

04:37.458 --> 04:40.172
Pop-pop said that
after he died,

04:40.176 --> 04:42.482
you should give me
ten bucks a week.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.292
Starting now.

04:44.836 --> 04:45.843
Okay.

04:45.997 --> 04:47.343
Um, listen,

04:47.347 --> 04:50.443
I'm out of town next week, so...

04:50.446 --> 04:51.751
Come on, we're leaving!

04:51.768 --> 04:53.993
Ooh. After one more mini-quiche.

04:56.796 --> 04:57.920
Excuse me.

04:57.927 --> 04:59.540
My brother twisted his ankle

04:59.545 --> 05:00.892
setting up the chairs.

05:00.895 --> 05:02.681
Will the tragedies that stalk

05:02.688 --> 05:05.223
this family never cease?

05:07.318 --> 05:09.210
Would you like to
be a pallbearer?

05:09.216 --> 05:10.300
Of course.

05:11.776 --> 05:14.581
I thought she said polar bear.

05:14.587 --> 05:16.892
Please, sir, a little
respect for the dead.

05:16.897 --> 05:17.940
Oh, yes, of course.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.663
Oh, my back!

05:21.675 --> 05:22.660
It hurts,

05:22.667 --> 05:24.510
and not in a good way.

05:24.528 --> 05:26.700
Well, time to move on with our lives.

05:29.088 --> 05:30.542
Oh, stop it!

05:32.085 --> 05:33.232
Help me !

05:33.238 --> 05:34.501
I'm down here.

05:35.287 --> 05:37.833
Homer, you have a mild back sprain.

05:37.835 --> 05:39.222
And you also ingested

05:39.227 --> 05:41.120
a dangerous quantity of grave dirt.

05:41.128 --> 05:42.693
Well, you're always telling me

05:42.698 --> 05:44.161
I should eat more dirt.

05:44.168 --> 05:46.333
Not dirt. Vegetables!

05:46.396 --> 05:48.591
Which grow in what?

05:48.596 --> 05:50.782
Oh! Look, I just need to make sure

05:50.785 --> 05:52.722
your vertebrae are properly aligned.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.903
This should take only a minute,

05:54.905 --> 05:56.303
and cost about a thousand dollars.

05:56.307 --> 05:57.292
D'oh!

05:57.298 --> 05:58.562
That doesn't sound like Homer's

05:58.566 --> 06:00.260
usual annoyed grunt.

06:01.168 --> 06:02.370
D'oh!

06:02.405 --> 06:03.400
D'oh.

06:03.505 --> 06:04.480
Fascinating.

06:04.688 --> 06:06.853
When Homer's on his back,

06:06.855 --> 06:09.300
his stomach lodges perfectly
under his diaphragm,

06:09.308 --> 06:11.211
giving him a powerful singing voice.

06:11.216 --> 06:12.562
Is that a real thing?

06:12.566 --> 06:13.443
It is!

06:13.445 --> 06:14.831
Tenor Andrea Bocelli

06:14.835 --> 06:17.283
recorded an entire song on his back.

06:17.285 --> 06:18.052
You know, Homer,

06:18.057 --> 06:20.170
your singing could help alleviate patient suffering,

06:20.207 --> 06:21.912
and save us a fortune in Demerol.

06:21.915 --> 06:23.342
My pleasure.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.571
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

06:28.145 --> 06:31.600
<i>It wouldn't be in summer</i>

06:32.175 --> 06:34.500
<i>Seeing you in summer</i>

06:34.682 --> 06:39.126
<i>I never would go</i>

06:39.431 --> 06:43.013
<i>Your hair streaked with sunlight</i>

06:43.390 --> 06:46.776
<i>Your lips red as flame</i>

06:47.119 --> 06:50.302
<i>Your face with a luster</i>

06:50.695 --> 06:54.611
<i>That puts gold to shame!</i>

06:54.927 --> 06:58.332
<i>But if I ever leave you</i>

06:58.336 --> 07:00.901
<i>It shouldn't be in autumn</i>

07:00.905 --> 07:03.111
<i>How I'd leave in autumn</i>

07:03.117 --> 07:06.582
<i>I never will know</i>

07:06.777 --> 07:10.600
<i>I've seen how you sparkle</i>

07:10.738 --> 07:14.232
<i>When fall nips the air</i>

07:14.655 --> 07:18.243
<i>I know you in autumn</i>

07:18.427 --> 07:22.030
<i>And I must be there.</i>

07:22.416 --> 07:25.833
Ah, nothing lifts my spirits like shopping.

07:26.087 --> 07:28.123
Let's see, I'll take his liver,

07:28.126 --> 07:29.681
a case of Adam's apples,

07:29.687 --> 07:31.843
that motorcycle man's moustache.

07:31.975 --> 07:33.710
Oh, the money you've
contributed to anti-helmet

07:33.717 --> 07:35.362
laws has really paid off, sir.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.690
Well, young people are my future.

07:37.695 --> 07:39.423
<i>And could I leave you</i>

07:39.428 --> 07:42.702
<i>Running merrily through the snow...</i>

07:42.706 --> 07:43.930
That beautiful voice!

07:43.938 --> 07:45.681
It's making my heart race!

07:49.476 --> 07:52.250
- Knowing how in spring...
- It's coming from down the hall.

07:52.257 --> 07:54.882
To the Betty and Herbert Weinstein Pavilion!

07:56.556 --> 08:00.652
<i>Oh, no! Not in springtime</i>

08:00.658 --> 08:05.523
<i>Summer, winter or fall</i>

08:05.526 --> 08:09.433
<i>No, never could I leave you...</i>

08:11.378 --> 08:15.361
<i>At... all!</i>

08:16.275 --> 08:18.231
Excellent, excellent!

08:18.238 --> 08:19.583
The Springfield Opera House,

08:19.588 --> 08:21.473
of which I am founder, artistic director,

08:21.478 --> 08:22.722
and standing ovation starter,

08:22.725 --> 08:24.240
is producing La Bohème.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.363
I want you to sing the lead.

08:26.516 --> 08:28.963
But I can only sing lying on my back.

08:29.038 --> 08:31.280
Uh, we'll cover it with a rewrite.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.580
Places, everyone!

08:39.586 --> 08:41.429
Oh, oh, I just have one question:

08:41.446 --> 08:42.690
what is this movie about?

08:42.697 --> 08:44.580
For the last time, it's not a movie!

08:44.585 --> 08:46.643
Excuse me, "film."

08:46.648 --> 08:48.030
It's an opera

08:48.035 --> 08:49.550
and you are in it!

08:50.718 --> 08:51.501
Good luck.

08:55.797 --> 09:00.093
<i>Rodolfo, perché lete che vi trovate gio?</i>

09:00.097 --> 09:04.400
<i>Ho danneggiato il mio piede.</i>

09:06.265 --> 09:08.040
<i>Nei cieli bigi</i>

09:08.045 --> 09:13.123
<i>Guardo fumar dai mille comignoli parigi.</i>

09:13.138 --> 09:15.131
- Homer's fantastic!
- Yeah.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.160
But these seats are terrible.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.592
Mimi! Mimi!

09:32.275 --> 09:34.592
Mimi! Mimi!

09:38.326 --> 09:39.812
Bravo! Bravo!

09:39.815 --> 09:41.982
Bravo! Belisimo !

09:41.988 --> 09:44.161
Encore! Encore!

09:44.985 --> 09:47.831
My boy, you are a star.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.542
Woo-hoo!

09:48.548 --> 09:50.413
An opera star!

09:53.478 --> 09:55.060
Dad, you were great!

09:55.067 --> 09:57.360
And you contributed to our culture!

09:57.377 --> 09:58.653
Well, I didn't mean to.

09:58.655 --> 10:00.300
No, no. It's a good thing.

10:00.307 --> 10:01.380
Oh, good.

10:01.398 --> 10:03.501
This makes up for me showing up drunk

10:03.506 --> 10:05.351
to the father-daughter dance.

10:05.357 --> 10:07.131
The dance isn't till next week.

10:07.137 --> 10:07.990
Sorry, Lisa.

10:08.017 --> 10:09.401
Can't change the future.

10:29.998 --> 10:32.980
And the home

10:33.276 --> 10:35.750
Of the...

10:36.207 --> 10:39.901
Bra-aave !

10:40.305 --> 10:41.922
We're free !

10:50.178 --> 10:52.201
Figaro, Figaro, la, la, la

10:52.998 --> 10:55.972
Nice set, Homer.
That was a hot one.

10:56.215 --> 10:59.843
Wow, praise
from Placido Domingo.

11:00.257 --> 11:01.800
Just call me P-Dingo.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.391
Eh, I'll think about it.

11:04.606 --> 11:05.451
You know, Homer,

11:05.665 --> 11:08.880
there's one thing about opera
that has always bugged me:

11:09.196 --> 11:11.363
everyone sings instead of talking.

11:11.848 --> 11:13.862
But you mademe believe

11:14.025 --> 11:18.063
I was in a magical world
where singing is talking.

11:18.257 --> 11:19.103
Thanks !

11:19.308 --> 11:22.313
You know, of the three tenors,
you're my second favorite !

11:22.656 --> 11:24.443
No wait, I forgot about
that other guy.

11:24.697 --> 11:25.711
Sorry, you're third.

11:27.355 --> 11:28.822
Wait, Homer, before you go,

11:29.097 --> 11:31.623
there is a new note
I've been working on.

11:31.978 --> 11:33.001
Tell me what you think...

11:42.905 --> 11:45.891
what if you gave it a little
more of this flavor...

11:50.147 --> 11:51.030
Like this ?

11:53.845 --> 11:56.002
Keep reaching for the stars, kid.

12:00.817 --> 12:03.000
Happy anniversary, sweetie.

12:03.377 --> 12:05.351
You know, it might be
a little more romantic

12:05.516 --> 12:07.292
without your entourage.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.150
But I need my childhood friends
to help me keep it real.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.763
Would you have me keep it fake ?

12:11.977 --> 12:14.110
Homer, can't weplease be alone ?

12:14.488 --> 12:15.981
It's our anniversary.

12:17.117 --> 12:18.570
We'll move to another table.

12:19.548 --> 12:20.550
Yoko.

12:20.926 --> 12:21.790
See ?

12:21.956 --> 12:24.483
Isn't it nicer,
with just you and...

12:24.616 --> 12:25.431
Excuse us.

12:25.586 --> 12:28.562
Would you mind signing
autographs for my mother and me ?

12:28.796 --> 12:30.432
Oh, my pleasure.

12:30.696 --> 12:34.080
To the hottest girls in the room.

12:34.656 --> 12:36.073
What is he saying ?

12:36.245 --> 12:37.851
I said you look hot !

12:39.065 --> 12:40.352
Ay Chihuahua !

12:40.498 --> 12:43.160
- Ay chi-what ?
- Hua-hua !

12:43.535 --> 12:45.823
I want you to stop
flirting with women.

12:46.096 --> 12:46.903
No problem.

12:47.037 --> 12:50.641
Sir, may I say I thoroughly
enjoyed your performance.

12:50.938 --> 12:51.940
May I say

12:52.136 --> 12:55.650
I'm enjoying the calm waters
of your deep, blue eyes ?

12:55.977 --> 12:57.323
Oh, well...

12:59.515 --> 13:00.312
What ?

13:00.527 --> 13:01.552
That's how guys talk.

13:03.465 --> 13:04.933
You are out of control !

13:05.108 --> 13:06.843
The late nights, the eating !

13:06.977 --> 13:09.193
You've actually
outgrown your cape !

13:10.615 --> 13:14.202
Oh, Homie...
I miss our alone time.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.212
I miss you.

13:19.116 --> 13:20.012
Need some help, H ?

13:20.248 --> 13:21.893
Want us to take Marge shopping ?

13:22.156 --> 13:24.891
You guys go on,
we're gonna walk home.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.081
Great call, H,
walking's the best.

13:28.698 --> 13:30.941
I really want to
hook up with Homer.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.333
Now we both know
that ain't gonna happen,

13:33.637 --> 13:35.601
but, uh, I'm right here.

13:46.968 --> 13:48.943
Marge, when I'm on stage,

13:49.115 --> 13:53.010
I can only sing those love songs
by picturing your beautiful face.

13:53.365 --> 13:57.882
So in a way, my groupies
are really our groupies.

13:58.307 --> 13:59.683
Aw, you're sweet.

14:00.008 --> 14:01.451
Oh, my God, it's him !

14:10.547 --> 14:12.541
Use your opera glasses, Dorothy.

14:16.595 --> 14:18.513
Switching to thermal imaging.

14:21.378 --> 14:22.640
Target acquired.

14:29.086 --> 14:30.753
Oh, we're trapped.

14:31.007 --> 14:33.052
Your fans will rip us to pieces.

14:33.188 --> 14:34.231
Not me, they love me.

14:44.908 --> 14:45.971
Get on.

14:53.487 --> 14:55.823
Sir, thank youfor saving us.

14:56.026 --> 14:57.502
Do you want
to come in for coffee ?

14:59.707 --> 15:01.183
That's right, I'm a woman.

15:01.488 --> 15:03.422
A lady motorcycle driver ?!

15:03.537 --> 15:05.173
What is this, The Twilight Zone ?

15:07.876 --> 15:11.003
It's a shame a few out of control fans
can make the rest of us look bad.

15:11.237 --> 15:13.471
I couldn't agree more, Julia.

15:13.726 --> 15:15.302
Listen, I love opera,

15:15.457 --> 15:17.550
but I hate the way these people
treat your husband.

15:17.638 --> 15:19.733
Why don't you make me president
of Homer's fan club

15:19.887 --> 15:21.551
and I'll keep the
crazies in check.

15:21.736 --> 15:23.912
That's a great idea.

15:24.116 --> 15:27.103
To celebrate, I'll go whip us up
some Chex Mix pie.

15:27.355 --> 15:29.333
So did you see the show tonight ?

15:29.587 --> 15:31.363
Remember the part
where I forgot the words

15:31.487 --> 15:33.782
and I just sang
"Uh-oh Spaghetti-os" ?

15:34.066 --> 15:35.412
I'm hoping they send me a case.

15:39.365 --> 15:40.381
Now listen, Homer.

15:40.556 --> 15:42.512
You can have meany
time you want me.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.060
Marge !

15:44.197 --> 15:45.672
But if you say
one word to your wife,

15:45.805 --> 15:46.870
I'll tell her you attacked me.

15:47.106 --> 15:48.360
What is it, sweetie ?

15:48.807 --> 15:52.411
Um... everyone's
wearing clothes in here.

15:52.638 --> 15:53.602
That's nice.

15:55.017 --> 15:58.501
Mr. Simpson will send you a photo if
you send him a self-addressed envelope.

15:59.535 --> 16:01.833
Mr. Simpson can not sing
at your daughter's birthday,

16:01.987 --> 16:03.303
but he will come for cake.

16:04.158 --> 16:06.562
Dedicate your shopping center ?
What's the anchor store ?

16:07.068 --> 16:08.010
I don't think so.

16:08.287 --> 16:09.483
She's perfect !

16:09.866 --> 16:13.860
For the first time since you became
an opera star I can finally relax.

16:14.136 --> 16:16.633
Well, uh, I'm not sure
she's working out.

16:41.446 --> 16:42.412
That's it !

16:42.597 --> 16:43.970
Let me make
something very clear:

16:44.127 --> 16:46.870
my heart belongs to Marge
and you can never, ever have it.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.220
This opera's over
when the fat man sings.

16:51.798 --> 16:53.792
All right, Homer.
I understand perfectly.

16:54.168 --> 16:55.160
You shall never be mine.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.403
That's good.
You've calmly accepted

16:57.535 --> 17:00.093
that you will never have the
only man you could ever love.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.143
Now, I think it would
be best if you left.

17:04.586 --> 17:06.211
- Julia, wait !
- Yes ?

17:06.435 --> 17:07.442
Before you go,

17:07.738 --> 17:09.460
could you hire your
own replacement ?

17:09.797 --> 17:12.589
But make sure she's
not crazy like you.

17:19.577 --> 17:21.161
Die, you stupid cobra !

17:21.396 --> 17:22.473
Die ! Die !

17:25.085 --> 17:27.619
Dad, I think someone's
trying to kill you.

17:27.835 --> 17:28.662
Who could it be ?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.260
A disgruntled former employee ?

17:30.545 --> 17:33.481
Whoever it is, the cobra
is their symbol.

17:36.806 --> 17:40.270
D'oh, d'oh, d'oh,
d'oh, d'oh, d'oh, d'oh

17:40.646 --> 17:44.120
Woo, woo, woo,
woo, woo, woo-hoo

17:44.525 --> 17:49.250
Stu, stu, stu,stu-pid Flanders.

17:49.588 --> 17:51.373
Why the crescendo,
my dear, old friend-o ?

17:51.726 --> 17:54.162
Get lost you waste
of a moustache.

17:54.497 --> 17:55.441
Okily-dokily.

17:56.365 --> 17:59.472
Chief, I think we should
cancel the performance.

17:59.625 --> 18:00.580
No can do, Marge.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.752
My first duty is to the
season-ticket holders.

18:03.056 --> 18:06.413
But don't worry, I've got the entire
opera house on a complete lockdown.

18:06.848 --> 18:08.611
I got sharp shooters on the gares,

18:08.858 --> 18:11.082
inflatable Homer decoys in the seats,

18:11.465 --> 18:13.322
and to take out
the biggest threat of all,

18:13.545 --> 18:15.343
we're pre-crashing
the chandelier.

18:21.476 --> 18:27.862
<i>Se il mio nome saper voi bramate</i>

18:28.235 --> 18:31.742
<i>Dal mio labbro il mio nome...</i>

18:32.665 --> 18:34.162
I'm so tense.

18:34.387 --> 18:36.702
I can't enjoy Count Almaviva serenading

18:36.708 --> 18:39.030
the intended bride of Dr. Bartalo.

18:39.356 --> 18:40.280
I just can't.

18:40.545 --> 18:42.002
I don't see anything suspicious.

18:42.257 --> 18:45.782
Except someone is loudlyun
wrapping their candy.

18:46.086 --> 18:48.612
It ain't candy, it's a lamb chop
wrapped in foil.

18:50.147 --> 18:51.770
Hey, Mom, do all
conductors carry

18:51.946 --> 18:53.421
poisoned blow-darts
in their pocket ?

18:53.576 --> 18:56.791
Well, Arthur Fiedler used to,
but I'd better take a look.

19:01.936 --> 19:03.263
Chief Wiggums !

19:03.737 --> 19:05.503
The maestro is the killer !

19:06.228 --> 19:07.482
All right, I'm going in.

19:14.978 --> 19:16.190
Allegro ! Allegro !

19:16.355 --> 19:17.983
I mean, andante. Andante !

19:18.677 --> 19:19.702
Ah, yeah.

19:30.298 --> 19:31.391
Snipers, take the shot.

19:49.665 --> 19:51.142
Okay, that's a wrap, people !

19:53.606 --> 19:55.071
Luckily, the sniper bullets

19:55.185 --> 19:56.892
stopped her heart
from pumping the poison

19:57.005 --> 19:59.292
through her body long enough
for the chandelier

19:59.486 --> 20:00.512
to squish it all out of her.

20:00.735 --> 20:03.003
With any luck, she'll be up
and stalking within a week.

20:05.398 --> 20:06.780
I'm sorry you got hurt,

20:06.977 --> 20:08.770
but you learned
an important lesson.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.433
No one comes between
me and my Homie.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.311
I'll get you for this, Marge,

20:13.597 --> 20:15.750
if it's the last thing I do.

20:15.976 --> 20:19.033
And I scheduled the cable guy to come
on Wednesday between 10:00 and 2:00.

20:19.215 --> 20:21.300
Oh, but Wednesday's
not good for me.

20:21.515 --> 20:23.360
I know, Marge. I know.

20:29.356 --> 20:31.361
Let's go, Hagliacci,

20:31.596 --> 20:34.393
or should I say,
Madame Butterface ?

20:34.845 --> 20:36.310
What ? What ?
I had two.

20:37.118 --> 20:38.110
Well, that's it.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.440
I'm retiring from the opera.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.121
It's just too popular.

20:42.556 --> 20:46.682
And I know something much more
fun I can do on my back.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.232
Transcript : Raceman
Traduction : Skualler, Rassman

20:50.868 --> 20:52.811
Singing opera made me
good at painting.

20:53.117 --> 20:55.352
- Is that a real thing ?
- No.
