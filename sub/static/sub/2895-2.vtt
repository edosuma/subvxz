00:00.984 --> 00:02.262
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:02.263 --> 00:04.810
What I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

00:04.842 --> 00:05.789
and to keep seeing you.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.391
Those two things are not
both gonna happen.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.892
You've been here
for three months.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.943
All you've done is hit singles,
and I need a goddamn home run.

00:10.979 --> 00:12.095
- Jonathan, listen--
- I don't want to hear it.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.530
Start making us
some real money.

00:13.565 --> 00:15.232
A man like Walter Gillis

00:15.266 --> 00:17.234
isn't gonna listen
to a guy like you,

00:17.268 --> 00:19.620
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

00:19.654 --> 00:21.905
Walter, I can't guarantee you
we'll win,

00:21.939 --> 00:25.442
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.411
All right,
I'm in.

00:27.445 --> 00:28.445
You're talking
hostile takeover.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.580
Gillis industries--

00:29.614 --> 00:30.947
Logan, we have a conflict.

00:30.965 --> 00:32.281
You're either with me
or against me.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.751
That includes all $1 billion
of my business.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.921
Get moving on drawing up a
tender offer for Logan Sanders.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.256
Do you remember
when I told you

00:39.290 --> 00:42.726
that I once had an affair
with a married man?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.862
It was him.

00:48.566 --> 00:50.067
You're up early.

00:50.101 --> 00:52.069
So are you.

00:52.103 --> 00:53.904
Well, I have to be.
You don't.

00:53.938 --> 00:58.108
I was already awake.
Thinking.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.493
About last night?
Look, Mike, I--

00:59.527 --> 01:02.329
- it's okay.
I'm good.

01:02.363 --> 01:05.147
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan?

01:05.166 --> 01:06.750
Why do you not
seem to believe me?

01:06.784 --> 01:08.318
Because you weren't good
last night.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.703
Which was before this morning

01:09.754 --> 01:13.457
when I realized that
that's work.

01:13.491 --> 01:14.991
This isn't.

01:17.178 --> 01:21.098
So as long as we don't let
that affect this...

01:21.132 --> 01:22.499
We won't.

01:22.517 --> 01:25.519
In that case, let's set
some in-home ground rules.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.387
Obviously, the first--

01:27.438 --> 01:29.640
Uh, respecting
each other's privacy.

01:29.674 --> 01:30.774
Exactly.

01:30.808 --> 01:32.392
The left-hand side of the desk
belongs

01:32.443 --> 01:33.843
to the United Nation of Ross.

01:33.861 --> 01:37.197
- You're not a nation.
- I have a flag.

01:37.232 --> 01:38.782
Fine.

01:38.816 --> 01:41.368
As long as we agree
that any perusal of my phone

01:41.402 --> 01:44.354
is considered a breach
of my borders.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:45.707 --> 01:47.857
I thought you liked it
when I breached your borders.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.828
Mm, well, those are
different kind of borders.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.997
In that case,
a breach is allowed.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.367
- Allowed?
- Encouraged.

01:57.385 --> 02:01.037
- Requested.
- Demanded.

02:01.055 --> 02:03.724
Let's go make you
late for work.

02:03.758 --> 02:07.010
Mm.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.812
Jessica, I am telling you.

02:08.846 --> 02:10.646
The S.E.C. is gonna send
Jeff Malone after us,

02:10.681 --> 02:13.883
and nobody is better suited
to beat him down than--

02:13.901 --> 02:15.051
you guessed it

02:15.069 --> 02:17.571
because we all know that

02:17.605 --> 02:21.024
this is better than this,

02:21.058 --> 02:23.860
which will result in this,

02:23.894 --> 02:27.664
which will also result
in this

02:27.699 --> 02:30.233
and this

02:30.251 --> 02:33.903
and this.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.905
And what do I want in return?

02:35.923 --> 02:40.177
Oh, you know what I want.

02:40.211 --> 02:42.179
You've always known.

02:42.213 --> 02:44.047
And after I win,

02:44.081 --> 02:48.084
you'll not only be willing
to give it to me.

02:48.102 --> 02:53.307
You're gonna be begging
to give it to me.

02:53.358 --> 02:55.692
Ha!

02:58.563 --> 02:59.696
- Louis.
- B--not now.

02:59.731 --> 03:01.732
- Louis, I have to talk to you.
- B--not now.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.099
How many times
have I told you?

03:03.117 --> 03:05.285
Unless you have photoshopped
my head onto a dragon,

03:05.320 --> 03:06.953
do not interrupt me
while I'm perfecting my pitch.

03:06.988 --> 03:08.538
Your pitch doesn't need
to be perfect.

03:08.573 --> 03:09.573
It needs to be now.

03:09.607 --> 03:10.940
- Why?
- Malone is here.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.493
- He's here?
- In the lobby.

03:13.544 --> 03:14.865
And Jessica just asked
to see you.

03:14.879 --> 03:16.913
Oh, out of my way.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.249
Aren't--aren't you going
to bring your easel?

03:19.283 --> 03:22.252
Oh, I don't need an easel
to kick this sucker's ass.

03:25.139 --> 03:27.424
Jessica.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.927
Jessica, I got your message,
and I just wanted to--

03:30.961 --> 03:32.763
Louis, this is Jeff Malone.

03:32.797 --> 03:35.632
Yeah, I know who he is.
He's with the S.E.C.

03:35.650 --> 03:38.402
He was
until this morning.

03:38.436 --> 03:39.969
We brought him over
because we have reason

03:39.987 --> 03:41.488
to believe
they'll be coming after us.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.073
Wait, what?

03:43.107 --> 03:44.775
Jeff is
our newest senior partner.

03:44.809 --> 03:50.447
He's going to be taking on
the S.E.C.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.915
Because you suck.

03:51.949 --> 03:54.484
And I wanted to introduce him
to you first

03:54.502 --> 03:56.753
because you're a loser.

03:56.788 --> 04:00.924
Who can get him up to speed
on Felton Securities.

04:00.958 --> 04:06.663
Because you're never
going to be name partner.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.049
And you're both experts
in finance.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.134
Louis, I'm really looking
forward to working with you

04:11.168 --> 04:14.170
on Felton Securities.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.774
Yeah, me too.

04:18.810 --> 04:22.112
You suck.
You're a loser.

04:22.146 --> 04:25.198
Louis?

04:25.233 --> 04:27.484
Is there something else?

04:27.518 --> 04:30.687
No.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.122
Nothing.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.721 --> 04:48.138
How long you been
working on that?

04:48.172 --> 04:49.222
Two hours.

04:49.257 --> 04:50.540
You know it's called
a brief, right?

04:50.575 --> 04:52.008
You know
his name's Harvey, right?

04:52.043 --> 04:53.977
You make
a compelling argument.

04:54.011 --> 04:55.011
So I got your note.

04:55.045 --> 04:59.215
What do you wanna talk about?
Um...

04:59.233 --> 05:00.216
Logan Sanders.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.351
What about him?

05:01.385 --> 05:05.054
We sort of dated
a few years ago.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.391
Wait, hang on.
Define "sort of."

05:08.409 --> 05:11.611
- Definitely.
- Define "dated."

05:11.662 --> 05:13.063
We had an affair
while he was married.

05:13.097 --> 05:14.097
Holy shit.

05:14.102 --> 05:15.385
I know.
And I--

05:15.450 --> 05:16.917
Yes, you have
to tell Harvey.

05:16.951 --> 05:19.202
Because, Rachel, if there's
two things that Harvey hates,

05:19.236 --> 05:22.706
it's things being kept from him
and things being kept from him.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.624
- I know.
- Then what am I doing here?

05:24.675 --> 05:26.075
I don't know
how to tell him.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.678
Quickly, because Logan's
gonna be here in an hour.

05:28.713 --> 05:30.013
What?

05:30.047 --> 05:31.915
And, Rach, it's less important
how you tell Harvey

05:31.933 --> 05:33.550
than that you tell Harvey.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.386
Go.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.473

05:39.524 --> 05:42.108

06:19.527 --> 06:20.827
I was wondering all day
if you would be--

06:20.862 --> 06:22.079
I can't do this.

06:22.113 --> 06:23.647
What?
Rachel--

06:23.665 --> 06:25.649
It's wrong.

06:25.667 --> 06:28.118
Wrong?
You're the one who kissed me.

06:28.152 --> 06:29.920
And I was wrong.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.655
No, you weren't.

06:31.673 --> 06:32.756
My whole life
I've done everything

06:32.790 --> 06:33.830
that I was supposed to do,

06:33.841 --> 06:36.426
and all it did
was make me miserable.

06:36.461 --> 06:39.596
Ever since I met you...

06:39.631 --> 06:42.182
I can't stop thinking about you,
and all I want to do--

06:42.216 --> 06:44.468
Logan--
Logan, if we do this,

06:44.502 --> 06:47.003
someone's gonna find out
at some point and then what?

06:47.021 --> 06:51.141
I don't care.

07:04.706 --> 07:07.357
Okay.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.710
Harvey, I need to tell you--

07:09.744 --> 07:11.828
Rachel?

07:12.880 --> 07:16.466
Logan.

07:16.501 --> 07:17.467
Where's Harvey?

07:17.502 --> 07:18.802
I don't know.
I'm early.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.704
He doesn't like it
when people--

07:20.722 --> 07:24.708
- What are you doing here?
- I'm Harvey's associate.

07:24.726 --> 07:26.476
You did it.
You went to law school.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.762
Not exactly.
I'm in law school.

07:28.813 --> 07:30.013
Rachel, that's great.

07:30.047 --> 07:31.381
I'm really proud of you.

07:31.399 --> 07:33.183
I'm just gonna come back.

07:33.217 --> 07:36.820
You came in here to tell him
about us, didn't you?

07:36.854 --> 07:38.405
How'd you know?

07:38.439 --> 07:40.056
It's all over your face.

07:40.074 --> 07:41.558
- Logan--
- Please don't tell him.

07:41.576 --> 07:44.161
I have to tell him.

07:44.195 --> 07:47.497
Rachel...

07:47.532 --> 07:49.065
Do you know
what people think

07:49.083 --> 07:51.168
when a son
takes over his father's company?

07:51.202 --> 07:52.669
That his father's proud
of him?

07:52.704 --> 07:54.671
That he didn't earn it.

07:54.706 --> 07:56.873
Which is why I'm not looking
to advertise the fact

07:56.907 --> 07:58.592
that I once had an affair.

07:58.626 --> 08:01.428
You're not advertising it.
You're disclosing it to counsel.

08:01.462 --> 08:03.880
Okay, look,
you want the truth?

08:03.914 --> 08:06.550
I'm not proud of the way I was
back then.

08:06.584 --> 08:10.437
The way I treated Allison,
the way I treated you.

08:10.471 --> 08:11.938
But I'm not that person
anymore,

08:11.973 --> 08:14.107
and I don't want people
to think that I am.

08:14.142 --> 08:16.259
And I understand that,
but I work for Harvey,

08:16.277 --> 08:19.095
and I can't keep things from him
that he needs to know.

08:19.113 --> 08:20.564
- He doesn't need to know this.
- Yes, he does.

08:20.598 --> 08:22.932
Why is that?

08:22.950 --> 08:24.985
Because I happen to live
with the man on the other side

08:25.036 --> 08:28.872
of the takeover battle.

08:35.111 --> 08:37.381
Oh, no.
You need some me time already?

08:37.414 --> 08:39.131
It's not me time.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.884
It's "I'm gonna kick
your ass" time.

08:40.918 --> 08:44.221
I think we both know you only
kick ass after eating a hot dog.

08:44.255 --> 08:46.473
I could be drinking a juice
box and still kick your ass.

08:46.507 --> 08:48.792
I don't think so,
because I have this.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.311
Just read it to me.

08:51.345 --> 08:54.481
"Harvey Specter,
you are summoned to"--

08:54.515 --> 08:56.983
You gotta be kidding me.
You're subpoenaing me?

08:57.018 --> 08:59.186
Oh, yeah.
I filed a T.R.O.

08:59.237 --> 09:00.570
I'm gonna block
your tender offer.

09:00.605 --> 09:01.805
Bullshit, you are.

09:01.823 --> 09:03.407
Well, we'll see what the judge
has to say.

09:03.441 --> 09:04.991
Oh, right.
You got your hands full.

09:05.026 --> 09:06.660
Here, let me get that for you.
There you go.

09:06.694 --> 09:08.645
Hearing's at 2:00.
I'll see you then.

09:08.663 --> 09:10.197
Oh, Harvey, the suit--

09:10.248 --> 09:13.483
it's a little dated for court,
don't you think?

09:15.336 --> 09:17.153
Did you get everything
settled with hr?

09:17.171 --> 09:19.339
Yeah.

09:19.373 --> 09:22.325
Corner office.
You really must like me.

09:22.343 --> 09:25.429
Don't get too excited.

09:25.463 --> 09:26.880
You know, the last two partners
that had this office

09:26.931 --> 09:28.298
didn't survive the year.

09:28.332 --> 09:29.999
Then it's a good thing
I'm much better than they were.

09:30.017 --> 09:31.768
You don't even know
who they were.

09:31.803 --> 09:33.336
That doesn't matter, Jessica.
I know who I am.

09:33.354 --> 09:36.673
Me too--
cocky lawyer in a corner office

09:36.691 --> 09:38.642
who hasn't done a thing
for me yet.

09:38.676 --> 09:41.311
Yet.

09:41.345 --> 09:43.530
By the way, I understand it's
tradition for the name partner

09:43.564 --> 09:44.964
to welcome a new partner
with lunch.

09:44.982 --> 09:48.518
Jeff, when I told you
that our relationship

09:48.536 --> 09:50.821
is now purely professional,
I was serious.

09:50.855 --> 09:53.540
Jessica, what's not
purely professional about lunch?

09:53.574 --> 09:55.876
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

09:55.910 --> 09:57.828
Oh, you're not hearing me.

09:57.862 --> 10:00.330
Oh, I'm hearing you.
I'm just ignoring you.

10:00.364 --> 10:02.716
But I promise I won't be
ignoring you at lunch.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.634
Cocky.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.311
Harvey. Harvey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

10:14.345 --> 10:15.562
Yeah, sure,
come on in.

10:15.596 --> 10:17.481
I was actually hoping
that we could talk in my office.

10:17.515 --> 10:18.732
What's the--
You're early.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.518
- Did you...
- Oh, you two haven't met.

10:21.552 --> 10:23.153
Rachel, Logan.
Logan, Rachel.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.654
- I guess you didn't.
- Didn't what?

10:24.689 --> 10:26.222
We actually have met before.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.241
That's why I was trying
to find you.

10:28.276 --> 10:30.076
- To tell me you met our client?
- No.

10:30.111 --> 10:33.229
To tell you that we used to be
in a relationship together.

10:36.367 --> 10:37.534
You looking
to get back together?

10:37.568 --> 10:38.668
No.

10:38.703 --> 10:40.570
- Then I don't give a shit.
- Good.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.589
Then we can move on to why
you didn't tell me that the guy

10:42.623 --> 10:44.758
on the other side of this fight
used to be your associate.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.710
- I was going to.
- When?

10:46.744 --> 10:48.244
In 20 minutes, when you were
scheduled to be here.

10:48.262 --> 10:49.679
Unfortunately,
I have to reschedule.

10:49.714 --> 10:52.048
- Why?
- I have court.

10:52.082 --> 10:53.183
Mike's alleging
I broke privilege.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.185
- Did you?
- Yes, technically,

10:55.219 --> 10:57.020
when I told you to move up
our timeline.

10:57.054 --> 10:58.722
Now, if you'll excuse me.

10:58.756 --> 11:01.591
W-wait a minute.
If you--if you broke privilege,

11:01.609 --> 11:02.930
what are you gonna
tell the judge?

11:02.944 --> 11:04.704
I don't know,
but until I think of something,

11:04.729 --> 11:06.530
I'm going to confuse the shit
out of everyone I can.

11:06.564 --> 11:08.281
That doesn't make any sense.

11:08.316 --> 11:10.734
- It makes total sense.
- No, it doesn't, Your Honor.

11:10.768 --> 11:12.319
All right, hold on.
Let me get this straight.

11:12.370 --> 11:14.571
You work for him?
Worked. I was his associate.

11:14.605 --> 11:16.072
Not the best associate,
Your Honor.

11:16.106 --> 11:17.207
Is that relevant?

11:17.241 --> 11:18.625
No, but I'd like it
on the record.

11:18.659 --> 11:20.877
Well, it's on there now
whether we want it there or not.

11:20.912 --> 11:23.246
And all I'm saying is, there's
no attorney-attorney privilege.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.381
Finally, a fact.

11:24.415 --> 11:25.382
An irrelevant fact,

11:25.416 --> 11:26.750
because at the time
of the conflict,

11:26.784 --> 11:28.585
I was his client.
Not the best client either.

11:28.619 --> 11:31.054
Mr. Specter, shut up.
Now you're his client?

11:31.088 --> 11:33.306
No, I was his client--
okay.

11:33.341 --> 11:35.141
I was an associate
at Pearson Specter,

11:35.176 --> 11:36.960
and then I left
to become an investment banker.

11:36.978 --> 11:38.178
It's very confusing.

11:38.229 --> 11:39.462
I'd dismiss the whole motion,
Your Honor.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.982
I said, "shut up."

11:42.016 --> 11:43.466
Are you an attorney
or an investment banker?

11:43.484 --> 11:44.768
I'm an investment banker.

11:44.802 --> 11:46.135
Then what the hell
are you doing in my chambers?

11:46.153 --> 11:47.904
Acting as my own attorney.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.240
And no matter how much he tries
to confuse the issue, he can't.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.692
I told him I was going
after the same company he was,

11:52.743 --> 11:54.694
and he used that knowledge
to move up his tender offer.

11:54.745 --> 11:55.829
He waived conflict.

11:55.863 --> 11:57.480
That doesn't apply
to privilege.

11:57.498 --> 12:00.083
Bottom line is, he doesn't
have proof of anything.

12:00.117 --> 12:01.317
I don't, but he does.

12:01.335 --> 12:03.987
Unfortunately,
he can't force me to testify.

12:04.005 --> 12:04.988
There's no precedent.

12:05.006 --> 12:07.007
Fortunately, there is.

12:07.041 --> 12:11.511
So go ahead, ask him
if he did what I'm saying.

12:13.381 --> 12:16.549
Mr. Specter,
do I need to swear you in?

12:16.601 --> 12:18.435
Give him the T.R.O.

12:18.469 --> 12:19.886
You know,
I'll do more than that.

12:19.937 --> 12:22.522
Not only can't your client make
a tender offer for 60 days,

12:22.556 --> 12:27.644
they can't purchase any more
stock until then either.

12:29.897 --> 12:32.816
I'm telling you,
we need to negotiate with him.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.117
You mean pay him off?

12:34.151 --> 12:35.685
Yes, that's exactly
what I mean.

12:35.703 --> 12:39.522
Every day this drags on, it's
millions out of your pocket.

12:39.540 --> 12:41.708
Well, from where I'm sitting,
all I can see is a lawyer

12:41.742 --> 12:42.909
trying to distract me
from the fact

12:42.960 --> 12:44.494
that this whole thing
is his fault.

12:44.528 --> 12:45.862
If I didn't break privilege,

12:45.880 --> 12:46.863
he might have locked
this whole thing up

12:46.881 --> 12:47.864
before you knew
what hit you.

12:47.882 --> 12:49.633
Fine.
We'll negotiate.

12:49.667 --> 12:53.219
No, I'll negotiate.

12:53.254 --> 12:55.171
No, not without me.

12:55.205 --> 12:56.473
Do I need to draw you
a picture?

12:56.507 --> 12:58.475
You, Mike, Rachel.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.810
Harvey, I appreciate
your concern,

13:00.845 --> 13:02.679
but this is my first deal, so
unless you're gonna pay him off

13:02.713 --> 13:06.850
with your money,
I'm gonna be at that meeting.

13:10.604 --> 13:12.656
What are you doing?

13:12.690 --> 13:14.824
I'm writing in my diary.

13:14.859 --> 13:16.776
Isn't that
what your dictaphone is for?

13:16.827 --> 13:19.362
No, my dictaphone
is for my singular triumphs,

13:19.396 --> 13:21.998
like when Harvey told me
I was the man,

13:22.033 --> 13:25.752
and my diary is
for my most agonizing defeats,

13:25.786 --> 13:28.571
such as when Jessica just told
me I'll never make name partner.

13:28.589 --> 13:31.841
- Louis, she didn't say that.
- Well, she might as well have.

13:31.876 --> 13:34.744
She just gave Malone
the corner office.

13:34.762 --> 13:35.745
Oh, my God.

13:35.763 --> 13:37.914
Yeah.

13:37.932 --> 13:39.549
And what's more is
I think I agreed

13:39.583 --> 13:41.184
to give him
Felton Securities.

13:41.218 --> 13:43.920
Well, un-agree to it.

13:43.938 --> 13:45.188
I can't.

13:45.222 --> 13:47.090
I shook his hand.
The die is cast.

13:47.108 --> 13:48.191
God damn it, Louis.

13:48.225 --> 13:50.193
You know how this works.

13:50.227 --> 13:51.644
First it's a case.
Then it's a client.

13:51.696 --> 13:54.764
Before you know it, you're
on the 38th floor with Ted.

13:54.782 --> 13:57.650
- Who's Ted?
- Exactly.

13:57.702 --> 14:00.937
Holy shit.
What did I just do?

14:00.955 --> 14:02.372
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.541
You're gonna stop writing
in that pussy diary,

14:04.575 --> 14:06.710
and you're gonna show Jessica
you're the one

14:06.744 --> 14:11.548
who should be sitting
in that corner office.

14:11.582 --> 14:16.002
Ready the dictaphone.
We're gonna need it.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.985
Hey. How are things
going Logan Sanders.

14:22.986 --> 14:25.254
- You have no idea.
- Do I want to have an idea?

14:25.289 --> 14:27.490
Not unless you want to hear
about how Mike Ross

14:27.508 --> 14:28.841
is still
causing us trouble.

14:28.876 --> 14:30.877
Nope.

14:30.928 --> 14:33.763
You don't care about
Logan Sanders at all, do you?

14:33.797 --> 14:35.548
No.

14:35.599 --> 14:38.801
This isn't
a coincidental encounter, is it?

14:38.835 --> 14:40.687
No, it is not.

14:40.721 --> 14:43.056
You are having lunch
with Jeff Malone today.

14:43.107 --> 14:44.524
Come on, Jessica.
You banged him.

14:44.558 --> 14:45.858
The least you could do
is take him to lunch.

14:45.893 --> 14:47.443
That is not funny.

14:47.478 --> 14:49.678
Wait a second,
you want me to take him to lunch

14:49.697 --> 14:50.846
because you banged him.

14:50.864 --> 14:53.649
Harvey...

14:53.683 --> 14:55.952
I want you to go ahead
and say "banged"

14:55.986 --> 14:58.854
to my face one more time.

15:00.357 --> 15:03.626
I'm not going to but not
because I'm scared of you.

15:03.660 --> 15:07.163
Whatever lets you sleep
at night, white boy.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.969
Donna, tell Paul Porter
he's meeting me for lunch.

15:13.003 --> 15:15.538
When he gets there, tell them
to seat him with Jeff Malone.

15:15.556 --> 15:16.973
Who's he not having
lunch with?

15:17.007 --> 15:19.058
- Jessica.
- Oh, done.

15:19.093 --> 15:21.094
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

15:21.145 --> 15:22.895
She asked you to go
because she didn't want to.

15:22.930 --> 15:25.014
You're sending Porter
because you don't want to,

15:25.048 --> 15:27.517
but you didn't have the balls
to say no to her face.

15:27.551 --> 15:28.518
Is that it?

15:28.552 --> 15:30.019
The balls are debatable.

15:30.053 --> 15:34.723
Balls are never debatable.

15:37.194 --> 15:39.112
- Ah, hey there.
- Hey.

15:39.163 --> 15:41.063
Louis, listen,
I just, um--

15:41.081 --> 15:42.698
I just wanted to say
one more time

15:42.732 --> 15:44.751
how much I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

15:44.785 --> 15:46.919
Aww, well, I would just like
to say for the first time

15:46.954 --> 15:48.204
that you will not be
working with me,

15:48.238 --> 15:50.373
because I will not be giving you
my jock,

15:50.407 --> 15:51.374
let alone my case.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.176
Yeah.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.743
Okay, I get it.

15:54.762 --> 15:57.013
So you're the guy?

15:57.047 --> 15:59.048
Yeah, I am the guy.

15:59.082 --> 16:01.601
No, not that guy, Louis.
Definitely not that guy.

16:01.635 --> 16:03.436
You're the guy in every office
who wants to piss

16:03.470 --> 16:06.722
on the new guy, you know,
to mark your territory.

16:06.756 --> 16:08.941
So why don't I just walk you on
down to my office?

16:08.976 --> 16:11.137
I'm gonna let you get your
little piss on in my corner,

16:11.145 --> 16:12.145
and then we can move on.

16:12.196 --> 16:13.613
Oh, I've moved on.

16:13.647 --> 16:15.431
I've set the deposition
for Todd Smith tomorrow.

16:15.449 --> 16:16.783
You don't think
I know about that?

16:16.817 --> 16:18.201
I don't give a shit
whether you know it or not.

16:18.235 --> 16:20.703
It's my job to determine
whether Todd Smith is guilty.

16:20.737 --> 16:22.857
And who do you actually think
is better at determining

16:22.873 --> 16:25.658
whether a guy is guilty
of insider trading, Louis?

16:25.709 --> 16:27.460
A career prosecutor
for the S.E.C.

16:27.494 --> 16:29.212
or a monkey
in some Italian suit?

16:29.246 --> 16:30.880
- A monkey?
- Monkey.

16:30.914 --> 16:32.882
Well, you're nothing
but a crowing cock.

16:32.916 --> 16:34.717
And the last cock that walked
into my office

16:34.751 --> 16:36.502
learned what
all the other cocks learned--

16:36.553 --> 16:39.138
that I eat cock for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.807
Louis, you're gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow

16:40.841 --> 16:42.008
whether you like it or not.

16:42.059 --> 16:43.559
Why, because you're gonna run
to Jessica?

16:43.594 --> 16:46.145
No, simply because I'm gonna
tell everyone here in the office

16:46.180 --> 16:48.981
that you said you eat cock for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

16:49.016 --> 16:51.734
Yeah, that's right.
It's goddamn delicious.

16:51.768 --> 16:54.270
Mmm! Mmm, mmm.

16:57.941 --> 16:59.661
So what, you think
you can handle Todd Smith

16:59.693 --> 17:01.110
better than me?

17:01.144 --> 17:04.079
Well, let's just see.
Let's just see what you got.

17:06.617 --> 17:08.651
Saw you scheduled a meeting
with Mike.

17:08.669 --> 17:10.670
I assume that means you're going
to offer him a deal.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.984
It could mean I'm going to
offer him a trip to Disneyland.

17:12.989 --> 17:14.323
But it doesn't.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.459
Of course not, he'd probably
want to wear mouse ears,

17:16.492 --> 17:17.960
and then nobody wins.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.127
You're welcome.

17:19.162 --> 17:20.847
I didn't thank you.

17:20.881 --> 17:23.041
Since you scheduled the meeting
when I'm at law school,

17:23.050 --> 17:24.666
which you did to cut me out.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.835
Did you get your name
on the wall since lunch?

17:26.854 --> 17:28.020
No.

17:28.055 --> 17:29.305
Then let's get
something straight.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.023
I didn't set that meeting.
Donna did.

17:31.058 --> 17:34.393
And if I didn't want you there,
I'd just tell you to your face.

17:34.444 --> 17:37.713
So let me tell you now, you're
not going to that meeting.

17:37.748 --> 17:39.699
Because you think
I can't handle it?

17:39.733 --> 17:41.701
Because I'm not throwing
gasoline on a pile of matches

17:41.735 --> 17:43.119
just to see what happens.

17:43.153 --> 17:45.404
Now, if you're done
wasting my time,

17:45.455 --> 17:48.991
you just gave me an idea.

17:49.025 --> 17:50.960
You're welcome.

17:56.833 --> 17:57.967
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

17:58.001 --> 17:59.168
You said it yourself.

17:59.202 --> 18:01.036
I never brought you a gift
when you moved in.

18:01.054 --> 18:04.240
- Still don't see an orchid.
- Flowers die.

18:04.274 --> 18:07.210
I thought I'd bring
something better.

18:07.244 --> 18:08.895
Me...

18:08.929 --> 18:11.564
Across the table from you.

18:11.598 --> 18:13.566
- Where's your client?
- He doesn't need to be here.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.484
This fight started
with you and me.

18:15.519 --> 18:17.153
So let's you and me
settle it right now.

18:17.187 --> 18:19.388
You mean you don't want him
here because you don't think

18:19.389 --> 18:21.157
Logan Sanders and I
can be in the same room.

18:21.191 --> 18:22.992
I don't think.
I know.

18:23.026 --> 18:24.110
Harvey, I'm a grown man.

18:24.161 --> 18:25.745
I can sit across the table
from somebody

18:25.779 --> 18:27.079
who had a history with Rachel.

18:27.114 --> 18:28.748
Maybe, but you both
have a brain and a dick,

18:28.782 --> 18:30.333
and if you get in that room
together,

18:30.367 --> 18:33.402
the brains aren't gonna be
leading that conversation.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.288
Fine, you tell me
that you have the authority

18:35.339 --> 18:38.708
to negotiate a deal,
and I'll negotiate.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.410
But you can't
'cause you don't.

18:41.428 --> 18:43.879
And I'm not gonna agree
to something here today

18:43.913 --> 18:46.081
just to have Logan reject it
tomorrow.

18:46.099 --> 18:48.017
So go home, get some sleep,
and then the three of us

18:48.051 --> 18:52.054
will do this again
in the morning.

18:57.826 --> 18:59.140
Look, here's the thing Todd

18:59.165 --> 19:01.069
You're not actually our client.

19:01.164 --> 19:02.698
Felton Securities is.

19:02.716 --> 19:04.833
And it's my job to find out
if you're telling the truth.

19:04.867 --> 19:06.368
Bullshit.
It's my job.

19:06.386 --> 19:08.870
- Louis, I'm handling this.
- No, you're not.

19:08.888 --> 19:10.539
If he doesn't stop lying to me,
I'm gonna cut him looser

19:10.557 --> 19:13.058
than Jared's pants
after a Subway diet.

19:13.093 --> 19:15.227
- I'm not lying to you.
- You took a tip.

19:15.262 --> 19:17.212
All right, Todd, you took a tip,
used it for your client--

19:17.230 --> 19:18.681
Yes, and now you're trying--

19:18.715 --> 19:20.849
God damn it, Louis!

19:20.883 --> 19:23.084
Listen, if you don't back
the hell off my interrogation,

19:23.103 --> 19:25.187
I'm gonna pick
his scrawny ass up

19:25.221 --> 19:27.156
and use him to beat
the shit out of you!

19:27.190 --> 19:28.440
Stop it!

19:28.491 --> 19:29.441
You think I don't know
what you're doing?

19:29.492 --> 19:32.528
You're trying to rattle me.

19:32.562 --> 19:33.912
- Uh-oh.
- What?

19:33.947 --> 19:35.331
Uh, your vein.

19:35.365 --> 19:36.665
- Here?
- It's bulging.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.083
Just like mine did,
right before my heart attack.

19:38.118 --> 19:39.868
- Louis, he's not gonna--
- What? Have a heart attack?

19:39.902 --> 19:42.404
That was exactly my thought
ten seconds before I was slumped

19:42.422 --> 19:43.672
on the courtroom floor.

19:43.707 --> 19:45.174
Oh, wow,
it's just like Jenkins.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.259
- Jenkins?
- No shit, Jenkins too?

19:47.294 --> 19:49.411
He was sitting
right next to me, hand to God.

19:49.429 --> 19:51.347
And, Louis, you should have
seen his wife and kids

19:51.381 --> 19:52.715
at the funeral.
Funeral?

19:52.749 --> 19:55.417
- Yeah, you have kids, Todd?
- Yeah, I have two kids.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.686
Yeah, well, whether it's
a heart attack or prison time,

19:57.721 --> 19:59.555
if you do not stop
lying to us,

19:59.589 --> 20:01.273
they're never going to see
their father again.

20:01.308 --> 20:03.025
Do you understand
what I just said?

20:03.059 --> 20:04.259
You are never going to play
soccer with them--

20:04.277 --> 20:06.928
Okay.
Okay, I am lying to you.

20:06.946 --> 20:08.597
But please,
you gotta help me.

20:08.615 --> 20:09.931
Well, we want to.

20:09.949 --> 20:12.534
But, T-dog, you gotta be
straight up with your homies

20:12.569 --> 20:13.535
if you want us
to have your back.

20:13.570 --> 20:17.105
The truth is,
I'm germaphobic.

20:17.123 --> 20:19.074
I have to wash my hands
throughout the day.

20:19.108 --> 20:21.577
And they get dry--
I mean really dry--

20:21.611 --> 20:24.046
so I have to put on
a lot of lotion.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.048
And I know
this sounds ridiculous,

20:26.082 --> 20:27.783
but my finger must have slipped
on the keyboard, and I--

20:27.801 --> 20:29.585
I hit the wrong stock.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.970
You're saying that you didn't
even mean to buy that stock?

20:32.005 --> 20:34.056
Nope, but then
it skyrocketed,

20:34.090 --> 20:35.841
and I wasn't gonna tell
everybody that I only bought it

20:35.892 --> 20:37.976
because I suffer
from dry skin.

20:38.011 --> 20:39.961
Please, you can't
cut me loose.

20:39.979 --> 20:43.432
I mean, I-I can't go
to prison.

20:43.466 --> 20:46.735
Unsanitary.

20:51.024 --> 20:52.658
Not that
it's any of my business,

20:52.692 --> 20:53.975
but it was straight before.

20:53.993 --> 20:55.143
I know.

20:55.161 --> 20:56.829
Oh, I get it.

20:56.863 --> 20:59.865
Look less together.
Get underestimated.

21:03.286 --> 21:06.288
You gotta wave
your hand slower.

21:08.291 --> 21:09.658
- Thanks.
- No problem.

21:09.676 --> 21:12.628
If you want soap, you just click
your heels together three times.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.214
How do you think I'm planning
on getting that dryer to work?

21:15.265 --> 21:16.548
You know, you think you wouldn't
have these problems,

21:16.599 --> 21:17.999
considering what
you guys charge.

21:18.017 --> 21:19.468
Oh, no, I don't work here.

21:19.502 --> 21:24.056
- But you, uh--
- I used to.

21:24.107 --> 21:26.308
You're Mike Ross.

21:28.611 --> 21:32.614
And you're Logan Sanders.

21:32.649 --> 21:34.516
Paper towel?

21:34.534 --> 21:37.986
Don't mind if I do.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.521
After you.

21:39.539 --> 21:41.790
- Don't mind if I do.
- I see you two have met.

21:41.825 --> 21:43.125
We have.

21:43.159 --> 21:45.627
And don't underestimate him
because of his tie.

21:45.662 --> 21:50.215
I have always estimated
that tie correctly.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.633
Now, can we talk
about business?

21:51.668 --> 21:54.536
Depends on what
you're proposing.

21:54.554 --> 21:55.838
That you walk away.

21:55.872 --> 21:57.673
That doesn't sound
like much of a deal.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.174
Well, he forgot to add
the part where you walk away

21:59.208 --> 22:01.260
$20 million richer.

22:01.311 --> 22:03.011
Pure profit.
No risk.

22:03.045 --> 22:05.213
Win-win.

22:05.231 --> 22:08.183
All right.

22:10.854 --> 22:12.905
Sounds good.

22:12.939 --> 22:15.157
Guess I just have
one question.

22:15.191 --> 22:17.493
What exactly are you going to do
with this company?

22:17.527 --> 22:20.162
All due respect, I don't see
how that's any of your concern.

22:20.196 --> 22:22.164
All due respect, you're the
one coming to me with an offer.

22:22.198 --> 22:23.732
So if I say it's my concern,
it is.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.752
Mike, you're asking about
a competitor's business plan.

22:26.786 --> 22:28.537
And if he wants
to not be competitors,

22:28.571 --> 22:30.672
then he needs to answer
my question.

22:30.707 --> 22:32.073
Okay, I'll tell you.

22:32.091 --> 22:35.911
I'm gonna do what anyone would
and sell it for parts.

22:35.929 --> 22:38.430
No deal.

22:38.465 --> 22:41.082
Okay, Mike.

22:41.100 --> 22:43.218
You win.

22:43.252 --> 22:46.254
Let's, uh,
make it 30 million.

22:46.272 --> 22:47.556
You could make it
a billion, Logan,

22:47.590 --> 22:49.358
and the answer is still
gonna be the same,

22:49.392 --> 22:51.527
'cause I made a promise
to Walter Gillis

22:51.561 --> 22:53.695
that I would fight
to keep his company alive.

22:53.730 --> 22:56.281
And I don't think he's gonna
believe that cutting a deal

22:56.316 --> 22:59.284
to sell his workers out
is keeping that promise.

22:59.319 --> 23:00.619
I thought you said
he was smart.

23:00.653 --> 23:02.454
I am, which I why I know
what's going on here.

23:02.489 --> 23:04.907
What exactly is that?

23:04.941 --> 23:07.659
No one ever
tells you no.

23:07.710 --> 23:09.945
You're used to getting
what you want.

23:09.963 --> 23:12.331
But that's gonna stop
right now.

23:12.382 --> 23:15.918
You're right.
I do always get what I want.

23:15.952 --> 23:17.219
I don't see how this time's
gonna be any different.

23:17.253 --> 23:18.720
I'll tell you
how it's gonna be different.

23:18.755 --> 23:21.223
This time you're talking about
something that I care about.

23:21.257 --> 23:22.724
So if you think I'm gonna
step aside and let you do--

23:22.759 --> 23:24.927
Yeah, I don't care
if you step aside or not.

23:24.961 --> 23:27.346
When I see something I want,
I take it,

23:27.397 --> 23:28.814
and then I do whatever the hell
I want with it.

23:28.848 --> 23:31.800
And what I wanna do with
this company is strip it down,

23:31.818 --> 23:32.851
flip it over--
Okay, that's enough.

23:32.902 --> 23:33.969
No, no, no, let him talk.

23:33.987 --> 23:35.320
I wanna hear this.
Keep going, Sanders.

23:35.355 --> 23:37.355
No, I don't need to
because you know how this ends.

23:37.357 --> 23:39.525
Yeah, I do, with me
and Walter Gillis on one side

23:39.576 --> 23:41.443
and you crying to your daddy
on the other.

23:41.477 --> 23:42.444
We're done.

23:42.478 --> 23:43.862
You're right.

23:43.913 --> 23:46.748
We are.

23:46.783 --> 23:49.317
Listen, the next time I say
"Don't come to a meeting,"

23:49.335 --> 23:50.919
don't come to a meeting.

23:50.954 --> 23:52.120
He came at me
just as hard as--

23:52.154 --> 23:53.338
I don't give a shit
what he did.

23:53.373 --> 23:55.340
Now, if you'll excuse me.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.759
- Where are you going?
- To get you this company.

23:57.794 --> 23:59.595
- What are you talking about?
- Weren't you listening?

23:59.629 --> 24:03.048
He just gave up
his weak spot.

24:04.684 --> 24:06.635
Was that true
about Jenkins?

24:06.669 --> 24:08.520
I don't even know
a Jenkins.

24:08.555 --> 24:12.107
But I do know Todd's vein
wasn't bulging.

24:12.141 --> 24:14.142
And, Louis, you were actually
pretty good in there.

24:14.176 --> 24:16.344
Yeah, I was.
And so were you.

24:16.362 --> 24:17.729
So we're in agreement.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.031
Yeah, you don't
completely suck.

24:19.065 --> 24:21.149
I just meant that
we should stick by Todd Smith.

24:21.183 --> 24:23.902
That story was so ridiculous,
it just might be true.

24:23.953 --> 24:26.071
Great, I'll call Felton
and make the recommendation.

24:26.122 --> 24:28.824
Well, hold up.
You're gonna do what now?

24:28.858 --> 24:30.659
Call my client?
Louis.

24:30.693 --> 24:32.828
It may be your client,
but it's still my case.

24:32.862 --> 24:33.879
Like hell it is, Jeff.

24:33.913 --> 24:37.049
- Okay. Okay, you call.
- Oh, I plan to.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.383
And when I do,
I'll be telling them

24:38.418 --> 24:40.168
that Mr. Slippery Fingers
is no longer our problem.

24:40.202 --> 24:42.471
Just one second ago,
you said you believed him.

24:42.505 --> 24:44.873
Yeah, I also told you that
his story was so ridiculous

24:44.891 --> 24:46.308
and nobody would believe it.

24:46.342 --> 24:48.427
Well, then it's our job
to make them believe it, Louis,

24:48.478 --> 24:49.878
or this guy could wind up
in prison.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.880
He is not my concern, Jeff.

24:51.898 --> 24:54.483
Felton Securities is.

25:03.776 --> 25:05.176
Walter Gillis knows
what he's doing.

25:05.194 --> 25:06.328
Yeah, so do I.

25:06.362 --> 25:07.913
He's letting your pension
go unfunded,

25:07.947 --> 25:09.731
so he can hoard $1 billion.

25:09.749 --> 25:13.585
No, that money is earmarked
for expansion into Asia,

25:13.620 --> 25:15.087
and I believe
in Walter's vision.

25:15.121 --> 25:18.239
You might, but do the workers
you represent?

25:18.257 --> 25:20.425
You're acting
as if our fund is empty.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.628
I'm acting
as if it's 40% full.

25:22.679 --> 25:25.347
And let me guess,
you're gonna fill up the rest.

25:25.381 --> 25:28.583
Someone else wants to acquire
Gillis' company

25:28.601 --> 25:30.418
before we can make an offer.

25:30.436 --> 25:32.187
If you vote to block it,

25:32.221 --> 25:35.724
we will fully fund your pension
the day we take over.

25:37.777 --> 25:40.112
You're talking about me
selling out my friend.

25:40.146 --> 25:42.781
I'm talking
about $500 million.

25:42.815 --> 25:44.483
And why can you fund it
and they can't?

25:44.534 --> 25:46.618
Well, they can with half
that billion, but they won't.

25:46.653 --> 25:49.437
Because like I said, he's
hoarding it for that pipe dream.

25:49.455 --> 25:52.107
You're gonna take that billion
for yourselves.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.575
Half.

25:53.609 --> 25:55.494
The other half goes to you
and your union--

25:55.545 --> 25:58.580
the men Walter Gillis
supposedly cares about.

25:58.614 --> 26:02.050
Pete, this is gonna happen
whether it's me or someone else.

26:02.085 --> 26:04.169
And someone else may not
give you the chance to do

26:04.220 --> 26:07.255
what you were elected to do:

26:07.289 --> 26:09.174
Protect your people.

26:14.857 --> 26:16.857
Hey.
Hey.

26:18.201 --> 26:22.371
How'd your meeting
with Harvey go today?

26:22.422 --> 26:25.124
I thought talking about work
was against the rules.

26:25.158 --> 26:27.843
Mm, talking about work is.
Talking about our day isn't.

26:27.877 --> 26:30.212
I mean, if we can't do that,
then we're letting the case

26:30.263 --> 26:33.966
come between us, right?

26:34.000 --> 26:36.935
My meeting with Harvey
went fine.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.838
But you didn't take
the deal.

26:39.873 --> 26:44.727
Because it wasn't
a good deal.

26:44.778 --> 26:48.230
Fine.

26:48.281 --> 26:50.482
Okay, what's the matter
with you?

26:50.516 --> 26:53.535
What's the matter is that
I heard what happened.

26:53.570 --> 26:56.372
- From him?
- No, from Donna.

26:56.406 --> 26:58.023
But it could have been
from any of the 50 people

26:58.041 --> 26:59.191
who saw the two of you
going at it.

26:59.209 --> 27:00.826
- Rachel--
- Just tell me this.

27:00.860 --> 27:03.162
Did you refuse the deal
because it wasn't good enough

27:03.196 --> 27:04.696
or because it came from Logan?

27:04.714 --> 27:06.048
You think I didn't take
this deal

27:06.082 --> 27:07.866
because of your history
with this asshole?

27:07.884 --> 27:09.501
Well, you did
just call him an asshole.

27:09.535 --> 27:11.536
He's an asshole because he's
willing to decimate a company

27:11.554 --> 27:13.806
just to put some money
in his pocket.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.808
Look, I gave my word
to Walter Gillis.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.760
That's what I told Harvey
and what I told Logan

27:17.811 --> 27:19.478
and what I didn't think
I'd have to tell you.

27:19.512 --> 27:24.650
I'm just saying, all of this
could have been over today.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.901
You think I don't want this
to be over?

27:25.935 --> 27:27.486
I do.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.771
But I can't take that deal.

27:28.822 --> 27:31.156
And we said we wouldn't let this
come between us.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.076
So don't.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.197
- Hi, Donna.
- Hey, Louis.

27:38.231 --> 27:39.564
What can I do for you?

27:39.582 --> 27:45.370
Oh, well, I just came in
to bring you this and this

27:45.404 --> 27:51.243
and all of these.

27:51.261 --> 27:53.429
Those are the last seven
Todd Smiths you evaluated.

27:53.463 --> 27:54.596
- Donna--
- Seven.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.181
And you didn't cut
one of them loose.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.383
- You heard me and Malone.
- I did.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.852
And you're cutting this guy
loose just to spite him.

27:59.886 --> 28:01.086
That's ridiculous.

28:01.104 --> 28:03.439
Okay, so this has nothing
to do with Malone?

28:03.473 --> 28:06.091
Nothing.

28:07.944 --> 28:09.594
Where'd you get that?

28:09.612 --> 28:11.697
Come on.
You know where I got it.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.032
Louis...

28:16.769 --> 28:18.270
I know he took your dream.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.209
I mean, she didn't even
consider me.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.128
Just brings him in,
had me train him,

28:26.162 --> 28:30.466
and gives him
the corner office.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.468
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the time that I auditioned

28:32.502 --> 28:35.587
for <i>Hamlet</i> in college?

28:35.621 --> 28:36.889
Obviously, you played Ophelia.

28:36.923 --> 28:39.124
No, Chrissy Kiff did.

28:39.142 --> 28:40.809
I was her understudy,

28:40.844 --> 28:43.145
and I was so jealous.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.681
I found myself wishing that
something would happen to her,

28:45.732 --> 28:49.801
that she would get sick
or she would twist an ankle.

28:49.819 --> 28:55.407
And then, the day
before we closed...

28:55.441 --> 28:59.611
Her father died.

28:59.645 --> 29:00.746
Donna, that wasn't
your fault.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.532
But I still felt horrible

29:03.583 --> 29:06.034
and ashamed

29:06.085 --> 29:11.623
'cause my jealousy had brought
out something really ugly in me.

29:11.657 --> 29:16.328
And as you can tell,
I still regret that.

29:16.346 --> 29:18.347
You know you've never
told me a story

29:18.381 --> 29:21.183
about yourself
like that before.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.603
I've never told anyone
that story before.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.973
Louis, I know how badly
you wanted this.

29:30.693 --> 29:33.362
But this is a man's life.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.863
We won't cut him loose.

29:34.898 --> 29:38.183
I'll tell Malone.

29:39.685 --> 29:41.686
I'm proud of you, Louis.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.378
Did you get an offer
to walk away from your takeover?

29:49.412 --> 29:50.579
I did.

29:50.630 --> 29:51.964
What was the offer?

29:51.998 --> 29:53.332
$30 million.

29:53.366 --> 29:55.801
And you turned it down?
What the hell is wrong with you?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.202
They're gonna rip
the company apart.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.087
I don't care if they wanna use
Walter Gillis' head

29:59.138 --> 30:00.472
as a paperweight.

30:00.506 --> 30:01.473
You said you wanted
a grand slam.

30:01.507 --> 30:02.758
That offer is a double.

30:02.809 --> 30:04.209
Well, I'd rather have a double
than nothing.

30:04.227 --> 30:05.210
Look, I know
what I am doing here.

30:05.228 --> 30:06.478
Do you?

30:06.512 --> 30:08.146
Because they just
flipped the head of the union.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.048
And without his vote,
we don't have shit.

30:10.066 --> 30:11.883
- What?
- These guys play to win.

30:11.901 --> 30:13.485
They just promised
$1/2-billion donation

30:13.519 --> 30:14.937
to their pension fund.

30:14.988 --> 30:18.907
And unless Walter Gillis is
gonna match it, we're done.

30:18.942 --> 30:19.992
Yeah.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.611
That's what I thought.

30:22.662 --> 30:24.663
You get that $30 million,

30:24.697 --> 30:28.166
or you find yourself
another job.

30:31.237 --> 30:34.206
Donna,
did you need something?

30:34.240 --> 30:37.626
No, but Louis does.

30:37.677 --> 30:40.128
He was planning to pitch you
that he take on Jeff Malone

30:40.179 --> 30:42.014
before you and Harvey
even met him.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.098
He saw Woodall coming
before we did?

30:43.132 --> 30:44.383
And if he won,

30:44.417 --> 30:48.053
he was hoping that
that would mean name partner.

30:48.087 --> 30:50.305
I empathize with that, Donna.
I do.

30:50.356 --> 30:51.423
But I have to make decisions

30:51.441 --> 30:53.225
based on what's best
for the firm.

30:53.259 --> 30:54.592
And I'm not here
to change your mind,

30:54.611 --> 30:56.395
but maybe if you did
something else for Louis--

30:56.429 --> 30:57.595
Such as?

30:57.614 --> 30:59.431
Giving him
the corner office.

30:59.449 --> 31:01.199
You mean
Jeff Malone's office?

31:01.234 --> 31:03.819
He could move to Louis'.

31:03.870 --> 31:06.738
I appreciate
you letting me know about Louis,

31:06.772 --> 31:08.106
but I'm not going
to do that.

31:08.124 --> 31:09.408
Well, why not?
Jeff Malone just got here.

31:09.442 --> 31:11.410
Because I said so.
Now if you'll excuse me--

31:11.444 --> 31:13.245
You're sleeping with him.

31:13.279 --> 31:14.630
- What?
- Of course.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.416
That glow, the morning meetings,
you had Harvey take your lunch.

31:17.450 --> 31:19.784
How could I miss it?
I'm losing my edge.

31:19.802 --> 31:24.973
Donna, there is nothing
going on between--

31:26.676 --> 31:27.976
you're not losing your edge.

31:28.011 --> 31:31.146
But I ended my relationship
with Jeff Malone

31:31.180 --> 31:33.298
the day that I hired him.

31:33.316 --> 31:34.733
And I respect that.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.018
But you said
you make decisions

31:36.069 --> 31:38.987
based on what's best
for the firm.

31:39.022 --> 31:43.942
Isn't giving Louis his dignity
back good for the firm?

31:46.829 --> 31:48.146
Hey, I got your message.

31:48.164 --> 31:49.981
Usually when someone
wants to talk business--

31:49.999 --> 31:52.668
I want to take your offer.

31:52.702 --> 31:56.321
Mike, that offer's gone.

31:56.339 --> 31:58.924
And what if I told you
I'd take less?

31:58.958 --> 32:00.292
I'd say I can't
give you less.

32:00.326 --> 32:01.760
Come on, you're the guy
who settles.

32:01.794 --> 32:04.880
I'm telling you
I wanna settle.

32:04.931 --> 32:06.765
You're telling me
you have to settle.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.183
And I know that
you can get that offer back.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.185
It's not my job
to get it back.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.020
And even if it was, you think
he's gonna give you a nickel

32:12.055 --> 32:13.689
after what you said to him?
What I said to him?

32:13.723 --> 32:14.856
What about what he said to me?

32:14.891 --> 32:16.191
I don't care what he said
to you.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.309
I gave you a way out,

32:17.343 --> 32:18.843
and you insisted
on going to that meeting.

32:18.861 --> 32:21.062
You didn't do that for me.
You did that for your client.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.699
What difference does it make?
It was a win-goddamn-win.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.617
And you shit all over it.

32:25.651 --> 32:26.868
Now I'm saying,
I'll take it.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.353
Yeah, well,
it doesn't work that way.

32:28.371 --> 32:29.988
I'm here as a courtesy.

32:30.022 --> 32:32.023
You're only here
because you lost.

32:32.041 --> 32:34.126
- Harvey, I'm--
- Enough.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.496
That company's fate is sealed.
It always has been.

32:37.530 --> 32:40.332
And the next time you walk away
from the table,

32:40.366 --> 32:43.835
be prepared to walk away
from the table.

32:57.447 --> 32:59.915
Hmm.

32:59.950 --> 33:01.031
Wanna pour me one of those?

33:01.034 --> 33:04.837
Help yourself.

33:04.871 --> 33:07.823
So what's going on
with Mike Ross?

33:07.841 --> 33:09.125
How do you know I'm thinking
about Mike Ross?

33:09.159 --> 33:10.926
Who else would it be?

33:10.961 --> 33:13.379
He got you on the ropes?

33:13.430 --> 33:15.931
No, I got him.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.833
And he's about to go down.
How do you know?

33:17.851 --> 33:19.468
'Cause the only way
to stay in the game

33:19.502 --> 33:23.472
is to get Walter Gillis
to give up his dream.

33:23.506 --> 33:25.274
And you don't think
he has the stomach

33:25.308 --> 33:27.276
to rip off the arm
to save the body.

33:27.310 --> 33:29.361
No, he doesn't.

33:29.396 --> 33:31.313
You don't seem to feel good
about that.

33:31.347 --> 33:33.449
No, I don't.

33:33.483 --> 33:36.685
Harvey.

33:36.703 --> 33:38.704
Do you remember when I gave you
the Collins case?

33:38.738 --> 33:39.955
Yeah.

33:39.990 --> 33:42.575
It was brutal,
what we had to do.

33:42.626 --> 33:44.693
It was my first taste
of that kind of thing.

33:44.711 --> 33:46.361
And you loved it.

33:46.379 --> 33:47.630
What's your point?

33:47.664 --> 33:50.966
Some people love
the taste of blood.

33:51.001 --> 33:54.003
Other people, hmm.

33:54.037 --> 33:57.039
Better to find out
who you are sooner than later.

33:57.057 --> 33:58.591
You saying
I'm doing him a favor?

33:58.642 --> 34:02.561
I'm saying,
you're being who you are

34:02.596 --> 34:07.149
and letting him
be who he is.

34:18.411 --> 34:22.397
What are you doing?

34:22.415 --> 34:23.699
I'm just thinking
about how much

34:23.733 --> 34:25.501
I'm going to miss
having my own office.

34:25.534 --> 34:28.402
Put your pride away, okay?
You can still go back to Harvey.

34:28.420 --> 34:29.737
I went back to Harvey.

34:29.755 --> 34:34.460
The money's off the table.

34:34.511 --> 34:36.745
Then you have to flip
that vote.

34:36.763 --> 34:39.047
The only way to do that
is to get Walter Gillis

34:39.081 --> 34:43.252
to put $500 million
into that pension fund.

34:43.270 --> 34:45.688
And if he does that,
he loses his expansion.

34:45.722 --> 34:47.056
Mike, then do it.

34:47.090 --> 34:50.425
Amy, when his son died,
this company became his family.

34:50.443 --> 34:52.777
If he doesn't expand, then
his company's gonna die too.

34:52.812 --> 34:55.063
I ask him to do that,
then I'm no better than Logan.

34:55.098 --> 34:56.899
No, you are better,
because after you do this,

34:56.933 --> 34:58.450
you're still gonna fight
to keep them alive.

34:58.485 --> 35:00.069
Gillis is not gonna see it
that way.

35:00.103 --> 35:02.204
He's just gonna see
some slick banker

35:02.239 --> 35:04.039
who sold him a bill of goods
just to end up doing

35:04.074 --> 35:06.909
what everybody else
was at least up front about.

35:06.943 --> 35:09.411
Mm.

35:09.445 --> 35:11.046
Then why don't you
just pack up your shit

35:11.047 --> 35:13.132
and crawl out of here with
your tail between your legs?

35:13.166 --> 35:15.718
Because if you don't have
the stomach to handle this,

35:15.752 --> 35:20.139
then you don't belong here.

35:21.758 --> 35:23.892
Hey, uh,
got your message.

35:23.927 --> 35:25.344
Is there something wrong
with Felton Securities?

35:25.395 --> 35:26.345
Not at all.

35:26.396 --> 35:27.846
Oh, thank God.

35:27.897 --> 35:30.465
I just assumed since you wanted
to meet here in Malone's office.

35:30.483 --> 35:32.434
Oh, this isn't his office
anymore.

35:32.469 --> 35:33.902
Oh, did he get fired?

35:33.937 --> 35:36.989
No, but he is moving.

35:37.023 --> 35:40.192
Louis, I know it hasn't always
been easy for you

35:40.243 --> 35:42.695
to embrace new partners,

35:42.746 --> 35:45.647
but you've made
a great effort with Jeff.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.499
All in a day's work.

35:47.534 --> 35:51.203
And your day's work has
benefited this firm for years.

35:51.254 --> 35:53.122
So we thought it was time
to show you

35:53.156 --> 35:56.091
a little
overdue appreciation.

36:04.467 --> 36:07.336
This office?

36:12.008 --> 36:13.108
I gave this office to Jeff

36:13.143 --> 36:15.861
because I wanted him
to feel valued here.

36:15.895 --> 36:20.616
But the truth is, I--
I should have given it to you.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.290
I don't know what to say.

36:28.325 --> 36:30.743
Oh, okay.

36:30.794 --> 36:33.412
All right, let it out.

36:33.463 --> 36:34.546
No way.

36:34.581 --> 36:36.298
Pete Kreeling would never side
with them.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.883
He would, and he has,

36:37.917 --> 36:39.368
because they offered
what you couldn't--

36:39.386 --> 36:40.919
security for his workers.

36:40.970 --> 36:42.051
They're my goddamn workers.

36:42.055 --> 36:43.972
Then show them
that you care about them.

36:44.007 --> 36:46.208
Fund the pension,
and fund it now.

36:46.226 --> 36:47.726
You told me you'd fight
to keep this from happening.

36:47.761 --> 36:49.681
I told you I would fight
to protect your company.

36:49.712 --> 36:51.730
And right now, this is
the best way of doing that.

36:51.765 --> 36:54.400
You're talking
about using my expansion money.

36:54.434 --> 36:55.434
If you don't use it now,

36:55.485 --> 36:57.236
there's gonna be
nothing to expand.

36:57.270 --> 36:59.521
You son of a bitch,
you manipulated me.

36:59.555 --> 37:00.656
No, I told you
a war was coming

37:00.690 --> 37:02.191
and that you needed
a war chest.

37:02.225 --> 37:03.859
Well, now is the time
to crack it open.

37:03.893 --> 37:07.413
You told me what I wanted
to hear to get me on your side.

37:07.447 --> 37:08.747
You're the same as them.
You're wrong.

37:08.782 --> 37:10.699
I looked you in the eye,
and I told you that I wanted

37:10.733 --> 37:12.234
to save your company.

37:12.252 --> 37:13.335
They looked me in the eye

37:13.370 --> 37:14.670
and told me they wanted
to rip it apart.

37:14.704 --> 37:16.205
You're the same as them!

37:16.239 --> 37:18.257
And you're an naive old man
having a tantrum

37:18.291 --> 37:22.077
because he's not getting
his way!

37:35.642 --> 37:38.861
That expansion
was my dream.

37:38.895 --> 37:41.029
I know.

37:47.737 --> 37:51.290
But now it's time to wake up.

37:51.324 --> 37:54.710
Fund the pension, Walter.

37:54.744 --> 38:00.499
Pete Kreeling's vote
stays in our favor, and...

38:00.550 --> 38:03.218
We live to fight
another day.

38:11.394 --> 38:12.811
No.

38:12.846 --> 38:15.597
I just wanted to thank you,
you know, for the new office.

38:15.631 --> 38:16.631
It's a downgrade.

38:16.649 --> 38:18.400
Not to me.

38:18.435 --> 38:20.235
I also wanted to thank you
for lunch.

38:20.270 --> 38:22.104
- I didn't show up for lunch.
- I know.

38:22.138 --> 38:23.906
You thought you were
sending me a message.

38:23.940 --> 38:25.240
I was sending you a message.

38:25.275 --> 38:27.276
Not the one you wanted,
Jessica.

38:27.310 --> 38:28.660
You see,
because what I heard is that

38:28.695 --> 38:31.646
you don't trust yourself
around me.

38:31.664 --> 38:34.333
If I didn't,

38:34.367 --> 38:36.001
I wouldn't have put you
right next door.

38:36.035 --> 38:38.487
Jessica, say what you will,

38:38.505 --> 38:40.255
but we both know
where this is headed--

38:40.290 --> 38:43.158
you and me
watching these.

38:43.176 --> 38:45.660
You think you know me
that well?

38:45.678 --> 38:47.329
Well, if I don't,

38:47.347 --> 38:51.166
I'm about to.

38:51.184 --> 38:53.185
Neighbor.

38:58.024 --> 39:02.277
More. More. More.
Ah, ah.

39:02.312 --> 39:04.696
Thank you.

39:10.019 --> 39:13.906
Happy corner office.

39:13.957 --> 39:16.792
Open it.

39:18.411 --> 39:20.162
- Is this...
- Me.

39:20.196 --> 39:23.499
As Ophelia.

39:23.533 --> 39:24.750
But I thought you--

39:24.801 --> 39:27.636
Yeah, well,

39:27.670 --> 39:31.557
sometimes bitter memories

39:31.591 --> 39:35.394
become bittersweet

39:35.428 --> 39:38.430
when you share them
with a friend.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.852
- You here to pick up Rachel?
- No.

40:16.886 --> 40:19.754
No, I just came by
to say thanks.

40:19.772 --> 40:20.973
For what?

40:21.024 --> 40:25.694
For not giving me
a way out.

40:25.728 --> 40:26.695
You funded the pension.

40:26.729 --> 40:29.898
100%.

40:29.932 --> 40:31.984
You just got rid
of half your war chest.

40:32.035 --> 40:36.738
Maybe, but I also did
what you thought I couldn't do.

40:38.124 --> 40:40.242
I got the vote back.

40:40.276 --> 40:44.997
Maybe now you'll realize that
I'm willing to go the distance.

40:45.048 --> 40:46.164
All you did was make it
to round two.

40:46.215 --> 40:47.466
Oh, so you thought

40:47.500 --> 40:50.218
this was gonna be like
one of those early Tyson fights,

40:50.253 --> 40:54.122
the ones that only lasted
45 seconds.

40:54.140 --> 40:55.173
Remember what happened
the first time

40:55.224 --> 40:57.225
someone made it
out of round one?

40:57.260 --> 41:00.228
And what ever did happen
to Buster Douglas?

41:00.263 --> 41:02.481
I don't know,
but wherever he is,

41:02.515 --> 41:05.601
they can't take that title away
from him.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.145
Hey.

41:17.163 --> 41:19.197
Hey.

41:19.248 --> 41:21.166
What you working on?

41:21.200 --> 41:23.985
You know what I'm working on.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.320
You wanna go home?

41:29.125 --> 41:31.543
Harvey.

41:31.594 --> 41:34.963
Guess that means you're
gonna be working late, huh?

41:34.997 --> 41:37.716
Um...

41:39.719 --> 41:41.937
Thanks to the guy
we're up against.

41:41.971 --> 41:46.108
He is proving to be much tougher
than everyone expected.

41:46.142 --> 41:48.860
- Everyone?
- Not everyone.

41:53.783 --> 41:56.401
He sounds like
a real douche bag.

42:00.323 --> 42:04.409
You know,
he's not that tough.

42:04.460 --> 42:06.795
I can work on this tomorrow.

42:06.829 --> 42:10.832
Let's get out of here.

42:14.671 --> 42:18.540
You really gonna
work on that tomorrow?

42:18.558 --> 42:20.375
No, I'm going to work on it
later tonight,

42:20.393 --> 42:23.712
but at least I'll be home.

42:23.730 --> 42:25.213
Think I can take a look at it
when you're done?

42:25.231 --> 42:26.214
I think not.

42:26.232 --> 42:27.599
Just a proofread?

42:27.650 --> 42:32.386
Ah, still no.
