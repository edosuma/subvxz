00:20.688 --> 00:21.854

00:21.856 --> 00:24.023
that you would feel
that same way about me?

00:24.025 --> 00:25.691
No.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.959
So I was gonna say
all that stuff to Carol.

00:30.630 --> 00:34.967
And if I'm being
completely honest,

00:34.969 --> 00:38.971
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

00:38.973 --> 00:42.474
Is there any chance that you're
feeling the same way about me?

00:45.078 --> 00:46.478
No.

It was some other song.

way I play it.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.232
We did it, Phil.

05:00.234 --> 05:03.635
Melissa and I had sex.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.938
No.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.273
Way.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.275
(laughs)

05:10.277 --> 05:11.677
No way.

05:11.679 --> 05:14.780
And it was
like a dream.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.782
We were just hanging out
at her house,

05:16.784 --> 05:18.450
drinking wine,
Mm-hmm.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.619
and then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

05:20.621 --> 05:22.621
we just started
kissing, you know?
Yeah.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.956
Anyways, after, like,
an hour of making out,

05:24.958 --> 05:26.692
she grabs me
by the arm,

05:26.694 --> 05:28.026
leads me upstairs,

05:28.028 --> 05:29.695
and we just started
going at it.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.862
(laughs)
I know.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.197
Then that song
got stuck on repeat.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.532
I'm so sorry, man.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.536
(laughing): Then it kind of
became our sex song.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.538
Awesome.
Yeah.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.540
Our sex song-- I've never had
a sex song before.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.275
Awesome.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.277
It was the...

05:45.279 --> 05:47.012
greatest night
of my life.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.880
I can't stop giggling,
you know.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.183
I'm just so happy.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.251

05:54.554 --> 05:56.221
Oh, hey, Phil.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.556
Hey.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.224
Uh, Todd, could you
come over to my place?

05:59.226 --> 06:01.193
I need some help
with that thing.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.195
Maybe I could help.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.731
I-I'm pretty good
with... things.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.800
No, it's a project Todd
already started on.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.069
Sure, I'll jump,
uh, right on that.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.071
Great.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.375
(whispering):

It's just-- what they're doing

they're having sex.

All right, let's get this party
started, raise the roof.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.611
Look, I thought that since
there are four of us here now,

08:32.613 --> 08:33.979
and a community is forming,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.947
it might be a good idea
to get together, like, a...

08:35.949 --> 08:37.315
a weekly town hall meeting
or something,

08:37.317 --> 08:40.051
where we can air our grievances
and stuff like that.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.887
That's why I got this.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.788

08:47.794 --> 08:49.794

Yes.
Mm-hmm.

08:49.796 --> 08:51.863
Okay, good, 'cause this is
really cool stuff.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.798
You listening
or are you pinching?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.333
We're listening.
Both.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.002
Okay, so when you have
a complaint,

08:57.004 --> 08:59.137
all you do is you write it
up on the board,

08:59.139 --> 09:01.239
then we can vote on this stuff.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.241
Now, how does
the voting process work?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.476
I'm about to tell you.

09:04.478 --> 09:05.911
Say you want to make
ice cream illegal,

09:05.913 --> 09:08.246
which is crazy
because ice cream is delicious,

09:08.248 --> 09:10.649
but what I would do is write up
on the board,

09:10.651 --> 09:12.317
"Ice cream should be illegal,"

09:12.319 --> 09:13.652
then I would motion
for a vote...

09:13.654 --> 09:17.155
Okay, I would like to vote
to keep ice cream legal.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.390
Carol, that was an example.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.658
Ice cream remains legal.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.725
Boom.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.727
Boom, indeed.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.896
That leads me to a motion
that I'd like to make.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.266
Since we're trying to form
a family-friendly community,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.569
our sexual dalliances cannot be
so frigging in-your-face.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.571
And I am looking at you,
Todd and Melissa.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.539
I'm so happy for you
guys, believe me.

09:34.541 --> 09:37.208
But I also have to look ahead
to the future, okay?

09:37.210 --> 09:39.210
And that's why I'm proposing

09:39.212 --> 09:42.948
a rigid sexual
curfew-slash-noise ordinance.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.182
Phil, I don't think
what Todd and I do

09:44.184 --> 09:45.183
is any of your
business.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.318
Uh, yes, it is.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.753
She doesn't know.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.689
They don't know.
Know what?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.424
Phil's the president.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.725
Of what?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.694
Of the United States
of frigging America.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.262
CAROL:
We had a vote.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.130
It was unanimous.
Yeah,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.433
so are we done?
Seriously? That's ridiculous.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.968
It's called democracy, Melissa.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.536
Maybe you've heard of it?
Oh, I've heard of it.

10:04.538 --> 10:06.605
I'm just concerned
that you're in charge of it.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.473
Well, Melissa, that's
a good lesson for you, then.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.575
Maybe next time,
you'll rock the vote.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.711
Okay, all in favor
of the rigid sex restrictions?

10:13.879 --> 10:15.880
Raise those hands.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.315
We got one vote already.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.883
Any other votes?

10:20.386 --> 10:22.487
Really, nobody?

10:22.489 --> 10:23.488
Ah...
I'd like
to propose

10:23.490 --> 10:24.623
that when you visit
your neighbor,

10:24.625 --> 10:25.757
you have to be wearing
a shirt.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.492
Uh, we live in Tucson.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.729
I, uh, propose that this lady
stop being so darn sexy.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.064
Guys, let's keep
to real motions, please.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.566
I have a real motion.

10:34.568 --> 10:36.468
I think Phil should have to
clean out his toilet pool.

10:36.470 --> 10:37.902
I second that.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.337
All right, we've done enough
voting for tonight.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.739
No, we should definitely vote
on this one.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.407
All in favor of Phil
cleaning out his toilet pool?

10:42.409 --> 10:43.475
Motion to adjourn!

10:45.911 --> 10:47.679
Ah...

10:48.481 --> 10:49.781
Todd, come on, bro.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.149
I'm sorry, Phil,
it's really...

10:51.151 --> 10:52.550
it's wafting.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.919
Well, it's final.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.521
Phil has to clean
out his toilet pool.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.522
Yes.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.923
How's that for rocking the vote?

10:58.925 --> 11:00.358
Come on, Todd.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.426
Yeah.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.730
Good meeting.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.340
♪

MELISSA:
Phil?

12:24.543 --> 12:26.010
Phil?

12:26.012 --> 12:28.379
Phil...?!

12:28.381 --> 12:30.415
Phil!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.350
Oh, hey.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.552
S-Sorry, is this
a bad time?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.755
No, no, no, no,
just having a little cry.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.423
Can we talk?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.091
Do you mind if I change
into something

12:40.093 --> 12:41.760
that's got
a little less poo on it?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.661
Uh, sure.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.432
So, uh, what's up?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.768
Uh... I just...

12:49.770 --> 12:51.402
came to apologize.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.403
For all the noise.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.404
You know.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.572
The song.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.107
Oh, no worries.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.076
No, it-it was
insensitive.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.245
Especially after
the talk we had

13:00.247 --> 13:01.613
about your
feelings for me.

13:01.615 --> 13:04.282
What? Are you still talking
about that talk?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.618
That was an admission
of love for Carol.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.620
How can I make that
more clear to you?

13:08.622 --> 13:11.689
(chuckling):
That's so cute that you think
that was meant for you.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.759
Phil, drop the act.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.095
Drop what act?

13:17.097 --> 13:19.063
Wha...?
(laughs)

13:19.065 --> 13:20.732
Just be a real person.

13:20.734 --> 13:23.768
I just keep thinking
about how close we came

13:23.770 --> 13:25.970
to, you know...

13:25.972 --> 13:26.971
Yeah.
...doing it.

13:26.973 --> 13:27.972
Boning.

13:27.974 --> 13:28.973
Yeah, I got what...

13:28.975 --> 13:30.141
where you were
going there.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.477
And now you and Todd are,
you know...

13:32.479 --> 13:33.978
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
...doing it.

13:33.980 --> 13:34.979
Having sex.
Yeah, again,

13:34.981 --> 13:36.648
Boning.
got it.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.982
You know, it's weird
how life works.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.651
Yeah.
All the "what ifs."

13:39.653 --> 13:42.987
Like, you think, what if Todd
had never seen those fireworks

13:42.989 --> 13:44.656
and left Tucson?

13:44.658 --> 13:46.090
Then we would have
never met him.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.492
Then you
and I would be,

13:47.494 --> 13:49.327
you know...
Uh, Phil.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.461
...currently boning.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.629
Phil.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.298
Knocking boots.
Yeah.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.266
Getting those boots
together and knocking...

13:55.268 --> 13:56.301
Phil, let's just not...

13:56.303 --> 13:57.602
just can't go
down that road.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.770
'Cause Todd
is here now.

13:58.772 --> 13:59.938
We were on that road.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.940
We were wearing
those boots.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.641
On that road.
Phil...

14:03.643 --> 14:06.845
Todd's here.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.281
Okay?

14:10.283 --> 14:12.684
But can I just ask?

14:13.786 --> 14:15.620
If Todd wasn't here...?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.188
Todd is here.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.758
Yeah.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.432
Todd's here.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.118
Todd's here.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.722
Hey, Phil.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.557
Hey, bud.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.459
You want to go for a ride?

14:59.164 --> 15:00.832
TODD: <i>You wouldn't</i>
<i>think it, you know,</i>

15:00.834 --> 15:03.167
<i>'cause she seems kind of,</i>
<i>like, conservative and stuff,</i>

15:03.169 --> 15:06.170
but she is just
an animal in the sack.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.839
I mean, she is just...

15:07.841 --> 15:09.173
(moans)

15:09.175 --> 15:11.843
Yeah.
My goodness,
we just...

15:11.845 --> 15:14.746
we'll go at it
for hours and hours.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.848
And, just, I feel
like I'm a teenager again.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.183
We must have done it,
I don't know,

15:19.185 --> 15:21.019
seven, eight times.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.021
That sounds great,
that sounds nice.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.023
Oh, my...

15:25.025 --> 15:27.292
I'm just still, like, vibrating.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.294
As well you should be.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.696
(both chuckle)

15:31.698 --> 15:35.033
Well, I'm so excited
to see this place.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.535
This is where you go
to do all your thinking, huh?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.537
Yeah.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.039
It's where it
all happens.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.374
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.376
Well, I'm sure
it's gonna be great.
Yeah.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.712
I mean,
it'd better be, right?

15:47.714 --> 15:50.114
We've been driving
for, like, three hours, man.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.554
What? Did you
hear something?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.122
No.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.991
No, something outside the car,
something with the wheels.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.893
It sounds like the back
wheel on your side.

16:01.895 --> 16:05.129
PHIL:
<i>Yeah, okay, if you could just,</i>
<i>like, get out and take a look.</i>

16:05.131 --> 16:06.531
TODD:
<i>Sure.</i>

16:15.174 --> 16:17.308
Yeah, you know, Phil,
I don't see anything.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.561
(screams, honks horn)

16:39.264 --> 16:41.332
(screams, honks horn)

16:57.016 --> 16:58.282
(chuckles)

17:01.653 --> 17:02.653
No.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.522
No, no.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.064
(screams)

17:16.201 --> 17:17.602
(screams)

17:46.231 --> 17:49.267
(panting)

18:08.353 --> 18:10.254
(muttering)

18:22.134 --> 18:24.469
(knocking on window)

18:24.471 --> 18:26.337
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.140
Oh, man.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.475
Nice try, Phil.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.410
I knew you were coming
back the whole time.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.045
(grunts)

18:36.648 --> 18:39.817
All right, so how much
longer till we get there?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.955
This is it.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.624
Yeah?

18:46.626 --> 18:49.160
Yeah, this is great.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.296
I mean, it looks like
the stuff we passed

18:52.298 --> 18:54.265
a couple hours
ago, but...

18:54.267 --> 18:55.299
I'm just kidding.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.934
No, this is... this
is great, man.

18:56.936 --> 19:00.204
Well, uh, should we
head back home?

19:01.507 --> 19:03.174
You know,

19:03.176 --> 19:04.575
give me a minute.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.020
(chuckles)

19:19.124 --> 19:20.525
Okay.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.700
Hey, Todd.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.369
Yeah.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.371
I'm sorry.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.839
What are you
sorry about?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.508
Just trust me.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.510
I'm sorry.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.512
Okay.

19:43.148 --> 19:46.450
Um, you-you don't have anything
to be sorry about.

19:48.153 --> 19:50.154
Can I tell you
what I was thinking about

19:50.156 --> 19:51.989
when I was...

19:51.991 --> 19:53.391
thinking at
your think spot?

19:54.660 --> 19:55.660
Yeah.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.727
What?

20:00.999 --> 20:02.934
You're a really
nice guy, Phil.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.109
I could be nicer.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.189
CAROL:
Phil?

20:25.191 --> 20:26.857
I'm in here, Carol.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.259
I got your note.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.594
What's the big
surprise?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.696
Carol, take out
your dryer sheets.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.531
Oh, not if my life
depended on it.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.766
Trust me on this--
just stand still.
What are you doing?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.101
Trust me,
trust me here.
Phil, no.

20:37.103 --> 20:38.436
Phil, don't do it.
Trust me. Trust me.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.870
No, Phil, no.
No, Phil.
Trust me.

20:39.872 --> 20:40.871
Trust me.
Leave 'em. Leave 'em.

20:40.873 --> 20:41.872
Trust me.
Leave 'em.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.107
Got 'em.
Take a deep breath.

20:43.109 --> 20:44.275
Uh-uh.
Come on, Carol.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.077
You can't hold your
breath forever.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.712
(sniffs, sighs)

20:47.714 --> 20:49.380
Huh?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.381
You cleaned out
your toilet pool.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.616
I sure did.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.950
Yeah, I stayed
up all night.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.953
Look at you, you little
pool cleaner, you.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.221
You must be pooped.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.256
(laughs)

20:58.258 --> 21:00.258
Well, you know,
I'm a nice person.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.892
And that's
what nice people do.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.894
Well, let me know next time
you have to go number two.

21:03.896 --> 21:04.895
I'll take you
to the hotel.

21:04.897 --> 21:05.896
Oh, it's okay.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.331
I have it
all worked out.

21:09.468 --> 21:10.468
Voilà.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.469
Ah!

21:11.471 --> 21:13.404
Wow. A Porta Potti.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.873
Phil Miller, you never
stop surprising me.
Thank you.
