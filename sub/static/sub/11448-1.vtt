01:50.838 --> 01:53.439
I don't think you realize
what a godsend you are.

01:53.441 --> 01:58.343
Not many people jump at the
opportunity to stay here alone.

01:58.345 --> 01:59.277
Why?

01:59.279 --> 02:00.845
Oh, old ghost stories.

02:00.847 --> 02:03.347
This is the oldest house
in the city, you know.

02:03.349 --> 02:05.215
Lots of history.

02:05.217 --> 02:07.283
A few unpleasant nicknames.

02:07.285 --> 02:09.251
We've tried to rebuild
the reputation in the

02:09.252 --> 02:15.389
neighborhood, but then last
winter the caretaker, well...

02:15.391 --> 02:17.257
Yes?

02:17.259 --> 02:19.192
Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.

02:19.194 --> 02:20.626
Please.

02:20.628 --> 02:24.596
Well, poor girl, she, she
threw herself off the

02:24.598 --> 02:25.763
upstairs balcony.

02:29.300 --> 02:30.600
Why did she do that?

02:30.602 --> 02:32.335
Hard to say, really.

02:32.337 --> 02:34.170
But you needn't
worry about that.

02:34.172 --> 02:36.372
This really is a
lovely old house.

02:36.374 --> 02:38.374
It will take care of you,
and I'm certain there

02:38.376 --> 02:39.508
won't be a single problem.

02:39.510 --> 02:40.475
Of course not, ma'am.

02:40.477 --> 02:41.809
Good.

02:41.811 --> 02:43.343
Will a check be alright?

02:43.345 --> 02:44.344
Yes.

02:44.346 --> 02:44.911
Splendid.

02:44.913 --> 02:47.647
Oh, I mustn't keep them waiting.

02:47.649 --> 02:49.815
I left our telephone
number by the phone.

02:49.817 --> 02:53.618
Feel free to call any time about
anything, even to say hello.

02:53.620 --> 02:54.385
I will.

02:54.387 --> 02:55.319
You're a doll.

02:55.321 --> 02:56.720
Toodle-oo.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.300
Darling.

10:44.028 --> 10:47.296
Poor girl.

10:47.298 --> 10:50.799
She threw herself off the
upstairs balcony.

11:33.236 --> 11:35.036
Yes?

11:38.206 --> 11:39.773
Hello?

11:39.775 --> 11:41.641
Darling, is that you?

11:41.643 --> 11:44.677
I wanted to check in and
make sure the first night

11:44.679 --> 11:45.978
went smoothly.

11:45.980 --> 11:49.748
I forgot to mention to you,
please, have your references

11:49.750 --> 11:51.382
reach out to us.

11:51.384 --> 11:52.316
Who?

11:52.318 --> 11:54.017
Andrew Dopling or something.

11:54.019 --> 11:54.851
Abbott?

11:54.853 --> 11:56.185
Yes, that's it.

11:56.187 --> 11:57.686
They were odd.

11:57.688 --> 11:59.721
Uh, I'll try them for you.

11:59.723 --> 12:02.757
I still haven't received my
final payment from them anyway.

12:02.759 --> 12:04.325
Just give them the
number I left for you.

12:04.327 --> 12:09.296
Uh, ma'am, there's one
room that I can't get into.

12:09.298 --> 12:11.231
Yes?

12:12.066 --> 12:15.668
Um, the room at the
end of the hall.

12:15.670 --> 12:18.971
Don't concern yourself
with that room, dear.

12:18.973 --> 12:20.405
Is that understood?

12:20.407 --> 12:23.307
It must remain
locked at all times.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.875
Am I clear?

12:24.877 --> 12:26.142
Yes ma'am.

12:26.144 --> 12:27.209
Thank you again.

12:27.211 --> 12:29.311
- Goodbye, dear!
- Ma'am?

13:48.017 --> 13:49.149
Miss?

13:52.353 --> 13:53.353
Miss?

13:53.888 --> 13:55.320
Oh, god!

13:55.322 --> 13:57.055
Uh, Jesus,
I'm sorry. Sorry.

13:57.057 --> 13:59.424
I just, you dropped this.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.863
Here.

14:10.032 --> 14:11.832
Sorry for frightening you.

14:14.202 --> 14:15.201
Okay.

14:15.203 --> 14:17.236
Alright then. Bye.

24:42.202 --> 24:43.769
Hell...

24:44.637 --> 24:45.937
Hello?

24:49.107 --> 24:52.943
Hello? Hello?
Hello, are you there?

32:06.974 --> 32:08.274
Hi.

32:08.276 --> 32:09.942
Can I...?

32:17.351 --> 32:19.517
Is anybody sitting here?

32:19.519 --> 32:20.451
No.

32:20.453 --> 32:22.019
Do you mind if I sit?

32:22.021 --> 32:23.286
Eh...

32:23.621 --> 32:29.924
Now I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

32:29.926 --> 32:34.929
Uh, I just hope your
boyfriend doesn't come and

32:34.931 --> 32:36.171
hit me in the back of the head.

32:37.032 --> 32:38.464
Don't worry.

32:40.166 --> 32:44.468
Have you...
Been here before?

32:44.470 --> 32:46.470
Why?

32:46.472 --> 32:47.437
You know, I don't know.

32:47.439 --> 32:50.506
Um, maybe I'm mistaken.

32:52.308 --> 32:53.675
What do you mean?

32:53.677 --> 32:57.011
Heh, I just, i-i guess
you look familiar.

32:57.579 --> 32:59.646
I just have one of those faces.

32:59.648 --> 33:01.314
Yeah.

33:01.316 --> 33:03.382
Yeah, I guess so.

33:04.050 --> 33:07.619
Hey, can I get you something?

33:07.621 --> 33:09.087
Like what?

33:09.089 --> 33:11.422
Uh, a drink.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.925
Let me get, um, two gins.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.960
Do you like gin?

33:18.294 --> 33:19.594
Sure.

33:38.613 --> 33:40.213
Very nice.

33:41.215 --> 33:42.715
Thank you.

33:48.321 --> 33:52.323
You're sure you're not
waiting for anybody?

33:54.326 --> 33:56.093
I was waiting for you.

33:56.095 --> 33:58.695
Heh, that's, that's funny.

33:58.697 --> 34:00.363
It's true.

34:00.365 --> 34:02.531
It's also very flattering.

34:03.332 --> 34:06.133
Uh, heh.

34:06.135 --> 34:10.437
I am gonna get another round.

34:15.375 --> 34:16.742
You too?

34:18.277 --> 34:20.710
Let me get, uh, two more.

34:20.713 --> 34:22.713
Why not?

34:27.518 --> 34:30.453
So uh, what do you
do for, uh, work?

34:30.455 --> 34:31.286
Hm?

34:31.289 --> 34:34.089
For work, your job?

34:34.091 --> 34:35.989
Nothing, really.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.297
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

34:46.300 --> 34:47.399
W-where're you going?

34:47.400 --> 34:49.567
I'll be right back.

34:49.569 --> 34:51.001
Huh?

34:51.003 --> 34:52.668
Don't go anywhere.

34:52.670 --> 34:54.203
Okay.

35:59.663 --> 36:01.296
You alright?

36:01.298 --> 36:02.463
Yes.

36:02.465 --> 36:03.630
Don't I look alright?

36:03.632 --> 36:05.498
Oh yeah, you look great.

36:05.500 --> 36:06.665
Thank you.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.567
I, I'm just, uh, waiting
for another drink.

36:09.569 --> 36:10.768
I don't know where
the bartender is.

36:10.770 --> 36:14.204
Do you want to come
back to my place?

36:14.206 --> 36:15.104
What?

36:15.106 --> 36:16.806
It's not far.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.475
There's plenty of Brandy.

36:20.911 --> 36:22.510
It's free.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.947
Yeah.

36:26.949 --> 36:30.283
Yeah, uh, let me just cash out.

36:36.256 --> 36:37.556
Alright.

36:37.558 --> 36:38.890
Let's go.

37:12.622 --> 37:15.490
Uh, are you joking?

37:16.725 --> 37:18.592
Are you coming?

37:18.594 --> 37:20.527
This is your place?

37:36.743 --> 37:38.475
You can sit here.

37:41.412 --> 37:43.246
Oh my god!

37:45.383 --> 37:49.551
You know, I gotta tell
you, I never pictured you

37:49.553 --> 37:51.286
living in a place like this.

37:51.288 --> 37:52.887
Why not?

37:52.889 --> 37:54.922
Well, because...

37:55.891 --> 37:57.490
I'm sorry.

37:57.924 --> 38:01.326
Well, they have got to
tell you this kind of

38:01.328 --> 38:03.261
thing before you move in, right?

38:03.263 --> 38:05.630
That it's haunted?

38:05.632 --> 38:07.698
Okay.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.033
So they must've gave you
a big discount, or...

38:10.035 --> 38:13.669
Which is obviously none
of my business, but...

38:13.671 --> 38:15.771
No. Please.

38:15.773 --> 38:19.975
I mean, it's just stories I
heard when I was growing up.

38:19.977 --> 38:24.312
But basically, they used
to tell us about this, uh,

38:24.314 --> 38:25.780
old lunatic.

38:25.782 --> 38:30.350
Used to live here, perform
these rituals in one of

38:30.352 --> 38:35.788
trying to conjure up the living
devil or something like that.

38:35.790 --> 38:38.490
It was kids' stories,
mostly, but...

38:38.492 --> 38:40.658
You grew up here?

38:40.660 --> 38:44.461
Yeah, I grew up just a few
blocks south of here,

38:44.463 --> 38:46.563
so don't hold that against me.

38:49.933 --> 38:53.969
Hey, uh, you know what, I
gotta be honest with you.

38:53.971 --> 38:59.473
This isn't something I ever
really do with anybody.

38:59.475 --> 39:01.975
The thing is, i-i just got
this big promotion, so..

39:01.977 --> 39:04.310
Do what?

39:05.712 --> 39:08.012
W-whatever it is
we're doing.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.583
We're having a drink.

39:12.585 --> 39:14.952
Oh yeah, yeah.

39:14.954 --> 39:16.720
Of course.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.522
It's just...

39:23.826 --> 39:26.093
It's funny, I uh...

39:26.095 --> 39:27.994
Phew.

39:29.062 --> 39:33.432
It's just not every day
I uh, go out and meet

39:33.434 --> 39:37.536
somebody like you,
who's so open.

39:37.538 --> 39:41.540
This whole city is...

39:41.542 --> 39:44.743
Always on the defensive,
and it's just...

39:44.745 --> 39:48.379
It's refreshing to meet
somebody who doesn't

39:48.381 --> 39:52.416
immediately think
you're a maniac.

39:53.886 --> 39:56.586
You're one of the good guys.

39:57.087 --> 39:58.887
I try to be.

40:00.089 --> 40:03.558
You're not lying to me?

40:03.560 --> 40:05.059
Hey.

40:06.428 --> 40:12.665
Tell you what, does it
look like I'm lying?

40:12.667 --> 40:15.467
Just one of those faces, Henry.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.603
Mm, what?

40:19.638 --> 40:20.904
No, i-I'm telling
you the truth.

40:20.906 --> 40:24.707
I am honestly one
of the good ones.

40:24.709 --> 40:27.609
Look, I waiting for my
friends at the bar.

40:27.611 --> 40:29.043
Ask them!

40:29.811 --> 40:32.546
I would never in a million
years just go home with

40:32.548 --> 40:36.116
someone I just met, who
invited me to their house.

40:36.118 --> 40:37.851
If I told them that,
and for whiskey?

40:37.853 --> 40:39.586
They would laugh in my face!

40:40.621 --> 40:41.988
I tell you what would be
really funny, we should

40:41.990 --> 40:45.691
give them a ring later on
and tell them, tell them

40:45.693 --> 40:47.826
that it's entirely
possible to have a cordial

40:47.828 --> 40:50.628
meeting with someone when you
just met them at a bar 'cause...

40:50.630 --> 40:51.795
Oogh!

41:07.909 --> 41:09.509
Agh!

41:16.649 --> 41:18.716
Oh god, ah...

41:20.151 --> 41:22.552
Why did you come here tonight?

41:24.555 --> 41:26.989
What did you expect?

41:28.691 --> 41:32.426
You didn't even ask me my name.

41:34.862 --> 41:37.697
Did you want to fuck me?

41:37.699 --> 41:38.497
Agh!

41:38.499 --> 41:39.865
Ahh!

41:47.539 --> 41:48.972
Remember me?

41:50.774 --> 41:52.741
Do you remember me?

41:56.011 --> 42:00.847
Because I remember you,
Henry Sullivan.

42:01.982 --> 42:09.982
I remember every single
thing about that night.

42:20.965 --> 42:22.932
Why did you do it?

42:25.101 --> 42:28.069
Why did you pick me?

42:29.838 --> 42:33.940
What did I ever do to you?

42:36.743 --> 42:38.977
Why did you pick me?

42:40.512 --> 42:41.945
Answer me!

42:42.579 --> 42:44.079
Fuck you!

42:44.081 --> 42:45.513
Agh!

44:08.289 --> 44:09.789
Help me.

44:13.326 --> 44:14.926
Help me.

44:15.661 --> 44:16.861
Help me.

44:19.764 --> 44:20.964
Help me.

44:20.966 --> 44:22.799
Help me.

01:03:19.918 --> 01:03:21.285
Hello?

01:03:21.287 --> 01:03:25.922
Darling, I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

01:03:25.924 --> 01:03:27.757
Ma'am?

01:03:27.759 --> 01:03:31.227
We finally got a hold
of your references.

01:03:31.229 --> 01:03:32.228
You did?

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.362
Yes.

01:03:33.364 --> 01:03:36.498
Dr. Abbott.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.900
Dr. Abbott?

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.769
You never cared for
his family, did you?

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:48.307
We know what you did, dear.

01:03:52.145 --> 01:03:53.845
Darling?

01:03:56.248 --> 01:04:00.851
I couldn't let him live
with what he did to me.

01:04:00.853 --> 01:04:05.121
But Dr. Abbott...

01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:07.556
He says I'm okay.

01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:12.227
He says I'm okay now.

01:04:12.229 --> 01:04:14.862
We're not mad, dear.

01:04:14.864 --> 01:04:16.430
We would just like you...

01:04:16.432 --> 01:04:18.532
We would just like you to leave.

01:04:18.534 --> 01:04:21.801
Take your things and leave.

01:04:21.803 --> 01:04:23.269
We would just like you to leave.

01:04:23.271 --> 01:04:28.907
I saw him walking around.

01:04:30.209 --> 01:04:35.312
Henry Sullivan.

01:04:36.947 --> 01:04:41.050
I saw him walking around
the street the other day.

01:04:41.052 --> 01:04:43.185
Right in front of me.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:50.123
I couldn't let him live
with what he'd done to me.

01:04:51.225 --> 01:04:52.925
Darling?

01:04:52.927 --> 01:04:59.498
What do you mean you "saw him
walking around the other day?"

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.533
Ma'am?

01:05:01.535 --> 01:05:04.903
Did you do something
to somebody?

01:05:04.905 --> 01:05:06.271
Did you do something
to somebody?

01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:08.006
Can you hear me?

01:05:08.941 --> 01:05:10.541
Can you hear me?

01:05:10.543 --> 01:05:12.843
Ma'am?

01:05:17.249 --> 01:05:18.481
Please just listen to me.

01:05:18.483 --> 01:05:20.082
You can keep the money.

01:05:20.084 --> 01:05:22.084
Please, just go home.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:24.386
Is it true what they
say about this place?

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:26.554
What? Who?

01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:33.026
That someone tried to conjure
the devil here once.

01:05:36.396 --> 01:05:39.397
It happened in that room,
didn't it?

01:05:42.167 --> 01:05:44.635
The one upstairs.

01:05:50.474 --> 01:05:52.942
They made me do it.

01:05:58.248 --> 01:05:59.881
Ma'am?

01:06:02.618 --> 01:06:06.621
I think I'll become one
of your ghost stories now.

01:06:06.623 --> 01:06:07.989
What?

01:06:07.991 --> 01:06:09.290
Hello?

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:11.191
Hello?

01:06:44.289 --> 01:06:47.391
What did you make me do to him?

01:10:22.622 --> 01:10:25.189
We can't cuff the guy unless...

01:10:25.191 --> 01:10:27.124
She said there was a murder?

01:10:27.126 --> 01:10:29.493
I-I-I don't know.
That's...

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.294
Now we got four
guys trying to...

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:10.831
Hey, listen, shut the
fuck up! Alright?

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.967
- Do you have the keys?
- I'm sorry. Jesus!

01:11:12.969 --> 01:11:14.702
Lighten up, will you?

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.369
It's a good story.

01:11:18.905 --> 01:11:20.338
Come on...

01:11:34.451 --> 01:11:35.818
Hello?

01:12:25.495 --> 01:12:27.929
This is the one you
were here for...

01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:36.469
You can be free.

01:14:33.612 --> 01:14:37.214
You don't know how much of
a godsend you are, really.

01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:39.883
Oh, well it was
fortunate for me, too.

01:14:39.885 --> 01:14:45.221
Somebody at such late notice,
especially with our reputation.

01:14:45.223 --> 01:14:47.056
Reputation?

01:14:47.058 --> 01:14:50.692
With the previous caretakers.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:57.799
Well, I really shouldn't
be telling you this.
