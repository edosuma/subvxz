WEBVTT

00:05.426 --> 00:06.967
Hey, Stan.

00:06.967 --> 00:08.299
Did you have fun
hanging out with the wife?

00:08.299 --> 00:10.091
How was your two-month
anniversary dinner?

00:10.091 --> 00:11.472
We went to
our favorite dumpster,

00:11.472 --> 00:13.394
but it's going downhill.

00:13.394 --> 00:17.138
Cats are starting to show up.
Next, it'll be hipsters.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.731
Plus, Princess has been
acting strange lately

00:20.731 --> 00:22.353
and I can't figure out why.

00:22.353 --> 00:24.945
If you're trying
to understand girls, just stop.

00:24.945 --> 00:27.608
They're irrational,
weird, and totally nuts.

00:27.608 --> 00:28.909
No, we're not.
Whoa!

00:28.909 --> 00:31.202
Dial it back, psycho.

00:32.653 --> 00:34.655
Mason always acts strange.

00:34.655 --> 00:36.917
Today he pasted
all his school books together

00:36.917 --> 00:38.329
and called it "big learnin'."

00:38.329 --> 00:39.830
Then he pasted
his hands together

00:39.830 --> 00:41.662
and called the nurse.

00:43.294 --> 00:45.966
Stan, I know
what's wrong with Princess.

00:47.468 --> 00:49.970
You know, Karl,
I almost wore that,

00:49.970 --> 00:51.222
then I realized
I wasn't being dropped

00:51.222 --> 00:53.344
behind enemy lines today.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.346
I need to be invisible

00:55.346 --> 00:57.308
when I do my daily sweeps
of the neighborhood

00:57.308 --> 00:58.979
with my parabolic
microphone.

00:58.979 --> 01:00.521
Keeping vigil.
Snooping.

01:00.521 --> 01:01.852
Keeping vigil.

01:02.983 --> 01:05.065
And I heard Heather say,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.898
"Princess is going
to have puppies."

01:07.898 --> 01:08.989
( gasps )

01:08.989 --> 01:10.741
What?
Oh, my gosh.

01:10.741 --> 01:13.534
This is the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

01:13.534 --> 01:15.696
I'm gonna be a father.

01:15.696 --> 01:17.368
Thank you,
talking plant.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.619
Stan, it's Karl.

01:18.619 --> 01:20.701
Oh, I have
a friend named Karl.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.335
I'm really
excited to be a father.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.297
But it's actually
not my first time

01:26.297 --> 01:27.918
in a paternal role.

01:27.918 --> 01:30.301
I once raised
a family of baby geese.

01:30.301 --> 01:32.213
Good thing,
I had that hang glider.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.943
Where have you been?

01:52.943 --> 01:54.405
We're supposed
to go dress shopping.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.536
I'm starting to think
you don't want to go

01:55.536 --> 01:56.577
dress shopping with me.

01:56.577 --> 01:58.579
Well, finish thinking that.

01:58.579 --> 02:01.292
You used to love
doing that with me.

02:01.292 --> 02:02.583
I pretended
to like a lot of things

02:02.583 --> 02:03.664
when we were dating.

02:03.664 --> 02:05.296
Like farmers markets

02:05.296 --> 02:07.298
and your Uncle Alan's
knock-knock jokes.

02:07.298 --> 02:08.459
Knock-knock.
Who's there?

02:08.459 --> 02:10.211
Us, unfortunately.

02:11.842 --> 02:14.014
You still find
my insecurity charming, right?

02:16.016 --> 02:19.220
Look, I bought
a desk for Chloe's room.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.891
If we don't assemble it,

02:20.891 --> 02:22.683
then we're just gonna have
this huge box sitting around.

02:22.683 --> 02:25.025
And I know how much
you hate huge boxes.

02:25.025 --> 02:26.146
True.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.728
My sister used
to hide in them,

02:27.728 --> 02:30.441
and then leap out at me
and yell "You're unpopular!"

02:30.441 --> 02:32.903
Okay, okay, I guess
we can build the desk.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.985
Great.
Thanks, honey.

02:34.985 --> 02:36.277
People like me!

02:36.277 --> 02:38.489
Sorry, reflex.
Just a reflex.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.377
Avery, I'm so excited
about being a father,

02:46.377 --> 02:49.630
I'm experiencing emotions
I don't even know the names of.

02:49.630 --> 02:51.842
So I made some up,
the Goofy Grinnies.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.798
The Happy Happies.

02:57.798 --> 02:59.430
And the Mega-Barks.

02:59.430 --> 03:00.851
Where you bark a lot.
I get it.

03:00.851 --> 03:03.474
No, I strip the bark
from giant sequoia trees.

03:03.474 --> 03:04.605
See?

03:06.477 --> 03:08.309
Trying to figure out
how you got that bark

03:08.309 --> 03:10.941
giving me
the Totes Confusies.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.523
I don't have a gesture
for it yet,

03:12.523 --> 03:14.235
but how about...

03:17.278 --> 03:20.200
I just can't wait to be
there by Princess's side

03:20.200 --> 03:21.742
when the puppies are born.

03:21.742 --> 03:24.875
It's gonna be
the happiest day of my life.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.458
I'm not letting your dog
anywhere near my Princess

03:27.458 --> 03:29.330
for the birth
of her puppies.

03:29.330 --> 03:32.092
No, no, this is horrible.

03:32.092 --> 03:34.755
Stan needs to be there
for the birth of his puppies.

03:34.755 --> 03:36.176
You can't do this to him.

03:36.176 --> 03:37.718
I can do whatever I want.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.100
Ever since Daddy made me
vice president of his company

03:40.100 --> 03:41.602
for tax purposes.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.805
What is wrong with you?

03:44.805 --> 03:47.938
Were you summoned to this realm
by some sort of incantation?

03:47.938 --> 03:49.730
What is wrong with you?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.353
Were you summoned to this realm
by some sort of incantation?

03:52.353 --> 03:55.486
Avery's never gonna believe
that I came up with that first.

03:56.527 --> 03:58.118
Here's the deal.

03:58.118 --> 03:59.239
We're taking Princess
to have her puppies

03:59.239 --> 04:01.071
at Chez Chateau Maison,

04:01.071 --> 04:03.364
the most luxurious
dog spa ever.

04:03.364 --> 04:05.826
None of you are getting
anywhere near her.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.249
Don't be evil, Heather.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.633
Please let Stan be there to see
his puppies being born.

04:12.633 --> 04:15.255
And please don't make
a coat out of them afterwards.

04:16.837 --> 04:19.840
Breaking news,
I don't care what you want.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.973
I'm thinking about becoming
a famous TV newsperson.

04:22.973 --> 04:24.475
And now to the weather.

04:24.475 --> 04:26.016
Ugh, it's hot.

04:28.389 --> 04:30.981
All right, we need
a plan to get Stan in

04:30.981 --> 04:32.232
for the birth
of his puppies.

04:32.232 --> 04:34.395
The place Heather
will be taking Princess,

04:34.395 --> 04:37.358
Chez Chateau Maison,
is very exclusive.

04:37.358 --> 04:38.989
They don't just let you in.

04:38.989 --> 04:41.201
In fact, the guards
at Fort Knox brag

04:41.201 --> 04:43.784
that Fort Knox
is the Chez Chateau Maison

04:43.784 --> 04:46.957
of heavily fortified
gold bullion depositories.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.671
No, they don't.

04:51.672 --> 04:52.833
So how are we getting in?

04:52.833 --> 04:54.585
We could form a ragtag band

04:54.585 --> 04:57.217
of highly trained misfits
to break in, like in the movies.

04:57.217 --> 04:58.549
I call charming con-man.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.300
And you're the flexible girl

05:00.300 --> 05:02.473
who can fold herself
into a dresser drawer.

05:02.473 --> 05:03.974
Thank you very much,

05:03.974 --> 05:05.386
But I can come up
with my own role.

05:05.386 --> 05:07.267
I'm the brains
of the operation.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.059
Who can fold herself
into a dresser drawer.

05:10.641 --> 05:13.774
And I'll be the scrounger
who can get anything.

05:13.774 --> 05:16.106
Copper wire...

05:16.106 --> 05:20.701
letters of transit,
2,000 Deutsche Marks.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.282
Thanks for playing
this game, Tyler,

05:22.282 --> 05:24.244
I've been holding
onto these for a while.

05:25.746 --> 05:27.618
And I'll be the sassy
computer expert

05:27.618 --> 05:30.080
who uploads the data
at the last second.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.872
I've never seen
this kind of encryption.

05:31.872 --> 05:34.084
Click, click, click.
I'm in!

05:35.456 --> 05:39.259
And I shall be
the master of disguise.

05:42.302 --> 05:44.054
Yes, Karl, we'll call you

05:44.054 --> 05:46.096
if we need anyone
to look like drapes.

05:47.307 --> 05:48.929
Actually,
I'm your best hope.

05:48.929 --> 05:51.311
Heather has
a massive crush on me.

05:51.311 --> 05:52.853
Really?

05:52.853 --> 05:54.274
I heard she had a thing
for some Venetian blinds

05:54.274 --> 05:55.476
at another school.

05:58.238 --> 06:00.150
No, she doesn't.

06:00.150 --> 06:01.612
I'm serious.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.984
Recently, women have been
finding me irresistible.

06:03.984 --> 06:06.156
I'm a late bloomer.
I get it from Father.

06:06.156 --> 06:07.828
Mother's sole contribution
to my genome

06:07.828 --> 06:09.950
is the ability
to digest raw boar meat.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.372
If you want raw boar meat,

06:12.372 --> 06:13.994
I'll need eight hours.

06:15.335 --> 06:16.206
You've got four.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.842
Karl, thank you
for offering to help,

06:21.842 --> 06:23.504
but I already have a plan.

06:23.504 --> 06:24.555
We can do this without you.

06:24.555 --> 06:25.966
Suit yourselves.

06:25.966 --> 06:28.218
A Fink only offers
his manly wiles once.

06:28.218 --> 06:30.010
Away!

06:35.856 --> 06:38.228
Bennett, I'm so sore from
putting that desk together.

06:38.228 --> 06:40.360
I've the worst
crick in my neck.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.192
Aaah!

06:42.192 --> 06:44.695
Ellen, you're just squeezing
an empty water bottle.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.697
It's the only thing
that relieves the pain.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.699
Aaah!

06:48.699 --> 06:51.201
We have some menthol rub
in the bathroom.

06:51.201 --> 06:53.163
Yeah, but, Bennett,
that just sounds like this.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.995
( blowing raspberries )

06:59.209 --> 07:02.172
I landed on purple.
I'll buy it.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.094
For the 10th time,

07:04.094 --> 07:07.347
this is not a game
where you buy things.

07:08.639 --> 07:09.930
I'm gonna get
a glass of water.

07:12.102 --> 07:14.475
Don't play bouncy
house on the couch.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.609
Hi, Mason.

07:18.609 --> 07:20.440
I was bored at home.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.693
That's Jason,
Mason's twin brother.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.275
Chloe doesn't know
Mason has a twin brother.

07:25.275 --> 07:28.068
I'm not even sure
they understand.

07:29.409 --> 07:30.781
I have to go
to the bathroom,

07:30.781 --> 07:32.282
but I'm playing a game
with Chloe.

07:32.282 --> 07:33.704
I'll finish the game
with her.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.875
Okay.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.078
Don't play bouncy
house on the couch.

07:38.078 --> 07:40.250
You're not the boss of me!

07:41.712 --> 07:43.463
What did I tell you?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.345
Hey, you're pretty.

07:45.345 --> 07:46.927
Okay, you can jump.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.930
It's your turn.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.265
Blue!
I'll buy it.

07:55.265 --> 07:57.307
For the 11th time,

07:57.307 --> 08:00.480
this is not a game
where you buy things!

08:01.732 --> 08:03.694
I have to go
to the bathroom.

08:06.366 --> 08:07.528
All done.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.699
What?

08:08.699 --> 08:10.410
How?
No, don't tell me.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.372
I don't want to know.

08:12.372 --> 08:15.706
Good, I don't even know
how it works anyway.

08:15.706 --> 08:17.247
My turn.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.710
No, it's not. You just rolled
and tried to buy blue.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.792
This is not a game
where you buy things.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.674
Aaah!

08:25.546 --> 08:27.387
Big news!
Big news!

08:27.387 --> 08:29.339
Got to let Chloe know
it's something important

08:29.339 --> 08:31.301
but I can't talk
in front of Mason.

08:31.301 --> 08:33.393
( barks )

08:36.016 --> 08:37.558
Your dog is acting weird.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.439
When my sock
puppets act weird,

08:39.439 --> 08:40.901
I put them on my feet

08:40.901 --> 08:42.773
but I can't do
that with your dog.

08:44.354 --> 08:45.355
I think my dog's upset
about something.

08:45.355 --> 08:46.857
Could you give us a minute?

08:46.857 --> 08:49.529
Okay, what should I do
so I don't get bored?

08:49.529 --> 08:52.863
I don't know, go look
for mangos in our gazebo.

08:52.863 --> 08:55.115
I don't know
what either of those things are,

08:55.115 --> 08:56.957
but Mommy says
I'm an overcomer.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.251
They're taking Princess
to have her puppies.

09:01.251 --> 09:02.713
I heard Heather
talking about it.

09:02.713 --> 09:05.796
We've got to go!
What are you doing?

09:05.796 --> 09:08.428
I wanted to see
what all the fuss was about.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.812
Remember, we're rich girls,
and Stan is a pregnant dog.

09:25.235 --> 09:28.398
You guys said I was silly
to get this pregnancy suit.

09:28.398 --> 09:30.400
But I told you,
when there's a costume sale,

09:30.400 --> 09:31.782
you buy everything.

09:31.782 --> 09:36.406
Next week,
I'm a conquistador.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.158
Let's hurry up.

09:38.158 --> 09:39.790
We don't have time to wait
for Tyler to park the car.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.413
Welcome to
Chez Chateau Maison.

09:43.413 --> 09:45.085
I'm Grace.
How may I help you?

09:45.085 --> 09:49.419
I'm Agatha Von Hempstead
of the Swiss Von Hempsteads.

09:49.419 --> 09:54.264
And I'm Constance,
her wealthier sister.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.476
Daddy's favorite!

09:58.428 --> 10:02.272
As you can see, our beloved
Stana is having puppies

10:02.272 --> 10:04.645
and she simply must be
taken care of here.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.276
I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

10:06.276 --> 10:08.228
Our last birthing suite
was booked for the day

10:08.228 --> 10:10.360
by the famous
French veterinarian,

10:10.360 --> 10:12.152
Dr. Frederic Monfore.

10:12.152 --> 10:13.443
He's flying in shortly

10:13.443 --> 10:15.405
for the show dog
Princess's delivery.

10:15.405 --> 10:17.237
It's quite a scandal.

10:18.408 --> 10:19.790
Mutt father.

10:19.790 --> 10:20.871
( gasps )

10:20.871 --> 10:22.622
Oh, my!

10:24.084 --> 10:28.628
Hello,
I am Dr. Frederic Monfore.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.211
You're the famous
French veterinarian?

10:31.211 --> 10:32.462
You look like a teenager.

10:32.462 --> 10:34.885
I get my youthful
looks from my mother.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.057
She looks so young that
when we go out to dinner,

10:37.057 --> 10:38.638
they make her
sit in a highchair.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.220
And they make her
wear a bib,

10:40.220 --> 10:42.062
but that is because
she eats like a horse.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.396
That is right, my mother
is a middle-aged woman

10:46.396 --> 10:48.608
who looks like a baby
and eats like a horse.

10:48.608 --> 10:51.031
And that is
all you need to know.

10:51.031 --> 10:54.364
I think some of the words here
are getting lost in translation.

10:54.364 --> 10:56.406
Let's just
speak in French.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.448
( speaking in French )

11:02.542 --> 11:04.624
( speaking in French )

11:07.127 --> 11:08.168
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Of course.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.050
Let me find her file.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.882
How do you know
French?

11:11.882 --> 11:13.714
Well, they've given me so much,
with their toast,

11:13.714 --> 11:15.425
their fries,
and their farces.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.677
The least I could do
was learn their language.

11:19.299 --> 11:21.301
Right this way, doctor.
Just down the hall.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.897
How did I get here?

11:26.897 --> 11:29.689
Mason?
What are you doing here?

11:29.689 --> 11:31.651
I got into the back
of your gazebo,

11:31.651 --> 11:33.023
but then it drove away.

11:33.023 --> 11:36.026
You got into the back
of our minivan!

11:37.117 --> 11:38.698
Chloe, come on.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.871
Mason,
how did you get here?

11:40.871 --> 11:42.412
It's a long story.

11:42.412 --> 11:44.034
First I rolled a seven.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.035
Then I bought purple.

11:45.035 --> 11:46.706
You can't buy purple!

11:50.420 --> 11:52.172
How did I get here?

12:01.301 --> 12:03.433
We've got to find
which room Princess is in.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.645
Bingo.
You found Princess?

12:05.645 --> 12:07.347
No, there's a dog
named Bingo in here.

12:09.349 --> 12:10.610
Jackpot!

12:10.610 --> 12:12.482
There's a dog named
Jackpot in there?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.905
No, I found Princess.
Catch up.

12:17.778 --> 12:19.950
Where's Mason?
You've got to find him.

12:19.950 --> 12:20.951
We can't have him
roaming around here

12:20.951 --> 12:22.202
messing things up.

12:22.202 --> 12:24.414
Got it.
We can't have a free Mason.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.627
What are you doing here?

12:27.627 --> 12:30.330
Security,
activate the knock-out gas.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.427
Why do you even
have a suggestion box?

12:39.509 --> 12:41.761
Master of disguise.

12:45.305 --> 12:48.518
Let's masterful of
getting out of disguise.

12:51.441 --> 12:52.943
Do you need me
to take advantage of the fact

12:52.943 --> 12:54.314
that Heather is
gaga over me?

12:54.314 --> 12:56.396
You're delusional.
Heather is not--

12:56.396 --> 12:57.487
Hello, dreamboat.

13:01.491 --> 13:04.404
You have
got to be kidding me.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.286
This is perfect.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.868
I'm gonna take Stan in
to be with Princess.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.250
You make sure Karl keeps
Heather distracted.

13:12.212 --> 13:13.333
How do I smell?

13:15.005 --> 13:17.217
Heather, stay on my left.

13:19.009 --> 13:22.342
Someone please
activate the knock-out gas.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.595
Princess,
I made it.

13:25.595 --> 13:27.888
She hasn't had
the puppies yet.

13:27.888 --> 13:29.599
Why are you still
doing the accent?

13:29.599 --> 13:33.023
I am-- how do you say,
enjoying it.

13:34.644 --> 13:35.815
What is going on here?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.198
I am the famous Dr. Monfore

13:38.198 --> 13:40.110
here to deliver
these puppies.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.241
It is?
That's interesting.

13:41.241 --> 13:43.243
Because I am
the famous Dr. Monfore

13:43.243 --> 13:45.205
here to deliver
these puppies.

13:45.205 --> 13:47.577
You are an impostor!

13:48.999 --> 13:51.121
I think my water just broke.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.502
No, that was pee.

13:52.502 --> 13:54.254
I'm really scared.

14:00.420 --> 14:02.342
You know,
when the receptionist told me

14:02.342 --> 14:05.345
I was already in here,
I knew there was a problem.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.679
You are in a significant
amount of trouble, impostor!

14:09.679 --> 14:11.391
That is ridiculous.

14:11.391 --> 14:14.104
You, sir,
are the impostor.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.146
I challenge you
to a duel.

14:19.779 --> 14:21.781
I demand satisfaction.

14:21.781 --> 14:23.743
Step outside.

14:25.075 --> 14:26.406
This is a closet!

14:26.406 --> 14:29.119
Or am I?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.793
I mean, or is it?

14:35.375 --> 14:38.298
That is it!
I am calling the authorities!

14:41.962 --> 14:43.673
Or is it?

14:45.765 --> 14:49.139
I mean, or are you?

14:49.139 --> 14:50.220
( knocking on door )

14:50.220 --> 14:51.972
Quiet, Dr. Monfore!

14:51.972 --> 14:53.313
I have your phone

14:53.313 --> 14:55.515
and I'm not afraid
to go over your minutes.

14:55.515 --> 14:56.937
I will be quiet.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.189
These international rates
are killing me.

15:03.283 --> 15:05.365
Mason, don't say anything
you shouldn't.

15:05.365 --> 15:06.576
It's very complicated.

15:06.576 --> 15:07.988
We're pretending
to be other people.

15:07.988 --> 15:09.990
I'm not Mason, I'm Jason.

15:09.990 --> 15:12.832
Sure, we'll go with that.
A little obvious, but okay.

15:13.873 --> 15:15.585
I need to use the bathroom.

15:15.585 --> 15:17.297
Go ahead.
I'll wait for you here.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.422
Hi, Chloe.
Aah!

15:24.384 --> 15:25.675
How'd you do that?

15:25.675 --> 15:27.887
I just opened my mouth
and words came out.

15:27.887 --> 15:29.759
"Pajama bottom."

15:29.759 --> 15:32.182
Sometimes it says
what it wants to say.

15:33.313 --> 15:34.764
Where's the bathroom?

15:39.189 --> 15:40.820
I overheard
the kids talking about

15:40.820 --> 15:42.402
how Heather's family
goes here.

15:42.402 --> 15:45.235
It is the best, most luxurious
spa in the area.

15:45.235 --> 15:49.369
Hi, I'd like to book
a treatment for my wife.

15:49.369 --> 15:53.243
Uh, we're not really
right for your wife.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.205
That is ridiculous.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.167
I do not care
how exclusive you are.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.039
My wife has a crick
in her neck.

15:59.039 --> 16:00.420
Aaah!

16:02.042 --> 16:04.464
So you are gonna
take care of her now.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.755
I don't think
you understand.

16:05.755 --> 16:09.219
Oh, I understand perfectly.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.302
Is this
what you're looking for?

16:13.353 --> 16:14.644
Uh, okay.

16:14.644 --> 16:17.147
If this is what you want.

16:17.147 --> 16:18.978
Right this way, ma'am.
Come, come.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.230
Come on, girl.
Come, come

16:22.192 --> 16:23.733
Thank you so much, Bennett.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.605
I will always remember
you did this for me.

16:25.605 --> 16:27.487
Oh, and give her
the works!

16:27.487 --> 16:30.370
Everything that you would do
for any of your clients!

16:30.370 --> 16:32.282
Oh, Daddy.

16:34.114 --> 16:35.825
And that's why the Center
for Disease Control

16:35.825 --> 16:37.827
had to permanently
seal off my first shed

16:37.827 --> 16:40.120
and bury it
in the Mojave Desert.

16:41.381 --> 16:42.212
Excuse me.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.126
I can't talk to him.

16:46.126 --> 16:48.338
He's too perfect.
I'm too nervous.

16:48.338 --> 16:50.340
I'm gonna vom.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.262
I'll just go
and be with Princess.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.684
No, no, no. No.
We can make this work.

16:54.684 --> 16:56.516
If you can't talk to Karl,

16:56.516 --> 16:58.308
you tell me
what you want to say

16:58.308 --> 16:59.939
and I'll talk to him
for you.

16:59.939 --> 17:01.641
You'd do that for me?

17:01.641 --> 17:03.563
You know this doesn't mean
we'll be friends.

17:03.563 --> 17:05.315
'Cause I know how much
you want to be my friend

17:05.315 --> 17:07.026
and it's just sad.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.700
What do you want me
to tell Karl for you?

17:10.700 --> 17:12.412
How many mice
you can fit in your throat

17:12.412 --> 17:14.414
after you've unhinged
your jaw?

17:16.366 --> 17:18.708
Tell him he's super-cute
and the total package.

17:18.708 --> 17:19.919
( giggles )

17:19.919 --> 17:21.541
And then giggle like that.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.928
So I'm just gonna pretend
we're talking for a few seconds.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.930
Smile and nod.

17:30.930 --> 17:32.382
Now pretend to say
something back to me.

17:32.382 --> 17:34.384
My great Aunt Helen
has skin like yours.

17:34.384 --> 17:36.226
But hers is
from swamp throat.

17:42.522 --> 17:44.734
Is it a problem that
we don't have a real doctor

17:44.734 --> 17:46.025
here for the birth?

17:46.025 --> 17:48.148
Dogs do it all the time
without doctors.

17:48.148 --> 17:50.029
Heather just got a doctor
because she's snooty.

17:50.029 --> 17:52.031
True, dogs are resilient.

17:52.031 --> 17:55.745
I just ate something
called biohazard, and I'm aces.

17:58.908 --> 18:00.370
Is everything okay in here?

18:00.370 --> 18:02.582
Yes,
everything is fine.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.294
These dogs are
about to give birth.

18:04.294 --> 18:07.297
All right.
I better play along.

18:07.297 --> 18:08.378
Push!
Push!

18:08.378 --> 18:10.009
Breathe! Breathe!

18:10.009 --> 18:13.012
Hee-hoo-hoo!

18:13.012 --> 18:15.305
Another doctor showed up
claiming to be you.

18:15.305 --> 18:17.477
No,
you must be mistaken.

18:17.477 --> 18:19.098
There is
no other doctor here.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.311
( knocking on door )

18:21.311 --> 18:22.312
What's that?

18:22.312 --> 18:24.484
I do not know.

18:24.484 --> 18:25.645
Let us check.

18:25.645 --> 18:26.986
After you.

18:27.987 --> 18:29.189
Oh!

18:29.189 --> 18:31.781
DR. MONFORE:
Bonjour, I am a doctor.

18:34.284 --> 18:35.905
The puppies are coming!

18:35.905 --> 18:37.997
Aah!

18:37.997 --> 18:39.239
It's happening!

18:39.239 --> 18:41.411
I'm not ready!

18:41.411 --> 18:44.454
Now tell him you're my moon,
my stars, my whole world.

18:44.454 --> 18:45.455
And make sure
you put your hand here

18:45.455 --> 18:46.506
when you say it.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.129
You could've
just told me to do it.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.302
You didn't have
to demonstrate on me,

18:52.302 --> 18:54.464
like with the butterfly
kisses earlier.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.851
Do you have
any hand sanitizer?

19:01.851 --> 19:03.393
Of course.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.894
And I'll be applying it
liberally to my face

19:04.894 --> 19:07.267
as soon as
you remove your hand.

19:07.267 --> 19:08.268
( phone chimes )

19:09.729 --> 19:11.361
The puppies are coming.

19:11.361 --> 19:13.363
Okay, I think
you two are ready

19:13.363 --> 19:14.904
to talk without my help.

19:16.576 --> 19:19.279
Topic of conversation,
you both think I'm inferior.

19:19.279 --> 19:20.280
Discuss.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.373
Her hand is clammy.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.995
Her cheek's no
picnic either.

19:33.002 --> 19:36.596
Oh, my gosh,
they're coming.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.719
You're gonna be
a dad, Stan.

19:39.719 --> 19:41.931
It's all happening so fast.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.723
What if I'm not cut out
to be a father?

19:43.723 --> 19:45.895
Dogs aren't like
human fathers.

19:45.895 --> 19:49.309
They're not involved
in their puppies' lives at all.

19:49.309 --> 19:51.361
What if I don't love them?

19:54.274 --> 19:56.366
Puppies.

19:59.279 --> 20:00.370
Here, buddy.

20:05.745 --> 20:08.167
Say hi to your son
and daughter, Stan.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.462
There's the sugar.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.336
You are the most amazing,

20:16.336 --> 20:19.339
perfect little wonderful things
I have ever seen.

20:21.301 --> 20:24.013
How could I ever think
I wouldn't love you?

20:29.559 --> 20:31.521
So, what are they doing
to your pooch?

20:35.445 --> 20:37.066
I beg your pardon.

20:37.066 --> 20:40.990
That is no way to--
Well, that is offensive.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.242
Oh, one of those
modern guys.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.535
Wants to treat 'em
like "people."

20:46.916 --> 20:48.368
I love her.

20:48.368 --> 20:50.540
Sure, but come on,
all the yipping,

20:50.540 --> 20:52.462
and always
needing attention.

20:52.462 --> 20:54.584
You get used to it.

20:55.965 --> 20:57.297
I just tell her,

20:57.297 --> 21:00.380
"Lay down at my feet
and be quiet, Duchess."

21:00.380 --> 21:02.472
Well, I feel sorry for her.

21:04.384 --> 21:06.306
There's my Duchess.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.348
Who's a pretty girl?

21:08.348 --> 21:10.980
What did they do to you?
Is that a bow?

21:21.160 --> 21:24.283
I brought Ellen
to a dog spa.

21:25.204 --> 21:26.456
She is going to--

21:26.456 --> 21:28.207
Bennett.
Ellen!

21:32.081 --> 21:34.464
I am so--
I had no idea that this was--

21:34.464 --> 21:38.468
I have never felt better,
Bennett.

21:38.468 --> 21:39.839
I mean, the biscuits
are a little hard,

21:39.839 --> 21:42.632
and the tub bath
was a tad invasive...

21:43.803 --> 21:46.476
but what an
amazing experience.

21:46.476 --> 21:49.018
The important thing is,

21:49.018 --> 21:51.270
no matter
what you find out later,

21:51.270 --> 21:52.812
you enjoyed today.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.604
Hold onto that.

21:56.936 --> 21:59.359
Stan, they are so cute.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.201
I'm naming them
Freddy and Gracie.

22:02.201 --> 22:04.033
DR. MONFORE:
Those are our names.

22:04.033 --> 22:06.536
Well, we've put you
two through a lot today.

22:06.536 --> 22:08.247
DR. MONFORE: Awww.
GRACE: Awww.

22:09.749 --> 22:11.250
Are they gonna be
able to talk?

22:11.250 --> 22:12.872
Won't know for months.

22:12.872 --> 22:14.293
But it doesn't matter.

22:14.293 --> 22:17.296
I'll love them
no matter what.

22:17.296 --> 22:18.838
Only two puppies.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.720
Seems kind of like
a small litter.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.882
We'll just think
of them as twins.

22:22.882 --> 22:26.175
TOGETHER: Our parents say
twins can be a handful.

22:27.557 --> 22:29.929
What?
You're a twin?

22:29.929 --> 22:31.771
Why didn't I know
about you're twin, Mason?

22:31.771 --> 22:33.312
We go to different schools.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.234
Our parents wants
to be individuals.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.356
But you're wearing
the same clothes.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.239
TOGETHER:
How did we get in these?

22:40.239 --> 22:42.321
Ugh!
I specifically said

22:42.321 --> 22:43.903
you weren't supposed
to be in here.

22:43.903 --> 22:47.326
I knew nothing
about this, darling.

22:47.326 --> 22:49.248
When a girl likes you,
it makes you want to like her.

22:49.248 --> 22:51.250
I didn't know
this dynamic was possible.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.754
We just wanted
to see the puppies.

22:54.754 --> 22:57.547
Get a good look, 'cause
my family's not keeping them.

22:57.547 --> 22:59.759
When they're old enough,
we're giving them away.

22:59.759 --> 23:02.762
Just because you're mad at us
for sneaking in here?

23:02.762 --> 23:05.174
No, we were always
giving them away.

23:05.174 --> 23:06.556
My parents
don't want more dogs,

23:06.556 --> 23:09.429
and I think
mutt puppies are gross.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.391
No!
I can't lose my puppies.

23:22.281 --> 23:23.943
I can't believe
Heather's family

23:23.943 --> 23:24.984
is gonna give
the puppies away

23:24.984 --> 23:25.985
when they're old enough.

23:25.985 --> 23:27.737
I love Gracie and Freddy.

23:27.737 --> 23:29.368
I love them, too.

23:29.368 --> 23:30.950
They were born
with great hair, just like me.

23:33.833 --> 23:35.414
You Photoshopped that.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.796
Not everything that's awesome

23:36.796 --> 23:40.920
is computer- generated, Avery,
and yes, I did.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.713
Guys, we can't let Heather
give away my children.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.004
Wait a minute.

23:45.004 --> 23:46.385
Maybe this
isn't a bad thing.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.177
You monster!

23:48.177 --> 23:49.849
What if we adopt the puppies?

23:49.849 --> 23:51.350
You didn't let me finish.

23:51.350 --> 23:53.392
You monster
with a heart full of love,

23:53.392 --> 23:55.975
misunderstood
by everyone around you.

23:57.316 --> 23:58.728
Like Gustov,
the imaginary monster

23:58.728 --> 24:00.399
that lives under my bed.

24:00.399 --> 24:03.362
At first he scared me,
but then we became friends.

24:03.362 --> 24:06.445
Gustov love Chloe.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.618
Right back you, G!

24:08.618 --> 24:11.701
I'm sure it won't be that hard
to convince Mom and Dad

24:11.701 --> 24:12.912
to have two more dogs.

24:12.912 --> 24:14.624
After all,
Stan is so easy.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.496
Stan got into the trash.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.498
There is garbage everywhere.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.419
Boy, I'm glad we don't
have more than one dog.

24:20.419 --> 24:23.252
Well,
that's unfortunate timing.

24:23.252 --> 24:24.924
After my wonderful day
at the spa,

24:24.924 --> 24:27.296
the last thing I need is
this kind of added stress.

24:27.296 --> 24:28.928
Maybe I should just
go back to the spa.

24:28.928 --> 24:30.850
No!

24:30.850 --> 24:33.012
I'll just hose you down
in the backyard.

24:33.012 --> 24:35.935
You know,
it was a lot like that.

24:35.935 --> 24:39.268
Look, I'm sorry Stan
got into the trash, Mom.

24:39.268 --> 24:41.270
Maybe the problem
is Stan needs company.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.441
Maybe we should get
another dog.

24:42.441 --> 24:43.863
Or maybe two more dogs.

24:43.863 --> 24:45.404
But where will we get them?
Oh, I know.

24:45.404 --> 24:46.816
Stan and Princess
just had puppies.

24:46.816 --> 24:48.407
Problem solved.
Love hugs.

24:48.407 --> 24:50.700
Whoa, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.782
Stan and Princess
had puppies?

24:52.782 --> 24:55.284
And Heather's going
to give them away.

24:55.284 --> 24:56.576
We really want to take them.

24:56.576 --> 24:58.668
What do you say?
Can we?

24:58.668 --> 25:00.419
I'm a teenager.

25:00.419 --> 25:03.212
This could be the last hug
you ever get from me.

25:03.212 --> 25:05.294
I see how much
this means to you guys,

25:05.294 --> 25:07.256
but you know
I'm not a dog person.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.008
You monster!

25:09.008 --> 25:11.010
I'm sorry, we're not getting
two more dogs.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.301
You didn't let me finish.

25:12.301 --> 25:15.394
You horrible,
horrible monster!

25:16.936 --> 25:19.689
I realize you have
some concerns,

25:19.689 --> 25:21.100
but I want to
let you guys know

25:21.100 --> 25:23.142
if you allow us
to keep the puppies,

25:23.142 --> 25:25.735
we promise we will never do
anything wrong ever again.

25:25.735 --> 25:27.276
( sneezes )

25:32.572 --> 25:36.325
We will never do
anything wrong ever again.

25:36.325 --> 25:38.117
Or sit on that couch.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.370
Come on, you can't
let Gracie and Freddy

25:41.370 --> 25:42.872
go to someone else.

25:42.872 --> 25:44.333
They're Stan's children.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.165
Sweetie,
Stan is just a dog.

25:46.165 --> 25:47.717
It's not like
he'll know the difference.

25:47.717 --> 25:50.339
It's normal
when a dog has puppies

25:50.339 --> 25:52.131
for the family
not to keep them.

25:52.131 --> 25:54.173
We promise
we'll talk to Heather's family

25:54.173 --> 25:57.306
and make sure the puppies
go to a nice, responsible home.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.308
Now that's the end
of the discussion.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.270
You see, Bennett,
this is what I was afraid of.

26:01.270 --> 26:02.521
All this disagreement
has taken me

26:02.521 --> 26:03.733
out of my relaxed state.

26:03.733 --> 26:05.234
I need to go
back to the spa.

26:05.234 --> 26:08.147
I said I would take you out
back and hose you down.

26:08.147 --> 26:10.239
Set the nozzle to blast
to get my hard-to-reach spots.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.285
We have eight weeks
until the puppies are

26:16.285 --> 26:17.787
old enough to leave Princess,

26:17.787 --> 26:19.578
and then Heather
will give them away.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.201
Okay, this doll is Mom.

26:22.201 --> 26:24.003
This is Dad.

26:24.003 --> 26:25.414
These are the puppies.

26:25.414 --> 26:27.466
And this is Heather.
What do we do?

26:27.466 --> 26:29.008
What are we gonna
use those for?

26:29.008 --> 26:30.259
This is my chance,

26:30.259 --> 26:32.261
Avery never plays
dolls with me anymore.

26:32.261 --> 26:33.673
But I told you I'd do it.

26:33.673 --> 26:35.885
It's not the same.

26:35.885 --> 26:37.476
Guys, the clock is ticking.

26:37.476 --> 26:39.218
What do we do
to keep the puppies?

26:39.218 --> 26:40.930
Best idea wins a ham.

26:40.930 --> 26:42.181
Stan, we love the puppies.

26:42.181 --> 26:43.723
You don't have
to offer us a reward.

26:43.723 --> 26:46.315
Good, because
I already ate the ham.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.817
And for similar reasons,

26:47.817 --> 26:49.649
best idea also does
not get a pork chop,

26:49.649 --> 26:52.401
a bowl of rice,
or a vacuum bag.

26:54.033 --> 26:55.234
( speaking in French accent)
I have got it!

26:55.234 --> 26:58.407
I will dress up
as a French doctor again.

26:58.407 --> 27:00.449
Tyler, that doesn't
work for everything.

27:00.449 --> 27:01.951
Sacre bleu!

27:03.663 --> 27:05.705
Ooh, I have an idea.

27:05.705 --> 27:07.336
You be Mommy.

27:07.336 --> 27:09.839
And I'll be Heather.

27:09.839 --> 27:15.254
"Hi, do you want to go
to a tea party?"

27:15.254 --> 27:17.887
Hey, Heather, I'll go
to the tea party with you.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.558
It's not the same!

27:20.639 --> 27:22.261
Well, here's my idea.

27:22.261 --> 27:24.353
Mom is the one
who's not a dog person.

27:24.353 --> 27:26.686
But she does
love to be loved.

27:26.686 --> 27:29.228
And Heather doesn't
care about the puppies

27:29.228 --> 27:31.270
so we can bring them
over here whenever we want.

27:31.270 --> 27:36.535
So we just have to show Mom
how much the puppies love her.

27:38.738 --> 27:40.700
I love you.

27:40.700 --> 27:45.494
Wow, the girl does
have mad doll skills.

27:45.494 --> 27:48.047
And getting Mom
to think the puppies love her

27:48.047 --> 27:49.418
is a pretty good idea.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.380
A ham-worthy idea.

27:51.380 --> 27:53.252
The best I can do is
burp in your direction.

27:53.252 --> 27:55.254
Get over here, you.

27:59.298 --> 28:00.850
( snoring )

28:00.850 --> 28:02.641
Once I paint this
meat juice on,

28:02.641 --> 28:03.763
then Mom will wake up

28:03.763 --> 28:05.184
with the puppies
licking her face

28:05.184 --> 28:06.605
and think they love her.

28:06.605 --> 28:08.397
There's no way
she can resist that.

28:08.397 --> 28:10.229
Puppy licks
are powerful.

28:10.229 --> 28:11.811
Did you know that
the first light bulb

28:11.811 --> 28:13.692
was nothing more
than a glass bottle

28:13.692 --> 28:16.115
in a puppy's mouth?

28:16.115 --> 28:17.817
Stan, there's no way
that could work.

28:17.817 --> 28:19.779
That's the lie
the candle companies

28:19.779 --> 28:21.490
spread to maintain
their stranglehold

28:21.490 --> 28:23.702
on the lighting industry.

28:26.916 --> 28:30.329
Ohh...
( giggling )

28:30.329 --> 28:33.042
The puppies are licking me.

28:33.042 --> 28:34.754
They must really love me.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.135
Of course, they love you.

28:36.135 --> 28:37.596
Why else would
they be licking you?

28:37.596 --> 28:38.717
Wait, why are you holding

28:38.717 --> 28:41.220
a basting brush
and a bowl?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.842
And why do
I smell like meat?

28:43.933 --> 28:45.895
You always smell like meat,

28:45.895 --> 28:47.556
you just never
noticed before?

28:48.607 --> 28:50.609
Nice try, Tyler.

28:50.609 --> 28:53.312
Bennett,
I've got meat juice on me.

28:53.312 --> 28:54.273
Get the hose!

28:57.026 --> 28:58.697
Don't worry, Stan.

28:58.697 --> 29:01.240
We still have eight weeks
to get Mom to love the puppies.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.531
The eight weeks are up

29:02.531 --> 29:04.413
and Mom still doesn't
love the puppies.

29:04.413 --> 29:07.416
And you've had that same shirt
on for eight weeks.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.919
I like bad smells,
but whew!

29:11.420 --> 29:14.423
Avery, Chloe,
and I have tried everything.

29:14.423 --> 29:17.716
We had them lick Mom,
made her Mayor of Puppy Town,

29:17.716 --> 29:20.219
I even gave Tyler hair
and eyebrows to Freddy.

29:23.883 --> 29:25.434
This is bad.

29:25.434 --> 29:28.307
Gracie and Freddy are old enough
now to be given away.

29:28.307 --> 29:29.849
( Ellen laughing )

29:29.849 --> 29:31.560
ELLEN:
Everybody, come look!

29:31.560 --> 29:33.232
( laughing continues )

29:36.025 --> 29:38.237
Oh, Tyler, you missed it.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.029
I asked your dad
what time it was,

29:40.029 --> 29:42.281
and he checked his watch with
a glass of water in his hand,

29:42.281 --> 29:43.993
and he spilled it
all over himself.

29:43.993 --> 29:45.784
Oh, do it again, honey,
he missed it.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.616
You want me
to spill water on myself

29:47.616 --> 29:49.578
because he missed it?

29:49.578 --> 29:52.001
Eh, it was funny
and I'm already wet.

29:52.001 --> 29:53.332
Okay.

29:53.332 --> 29:54.713
Bennett, what time is it?

29:54.713 --> 29:56.215
Well, it's about--

29:58.677 --> 30:00.089
That's why I love you
so much.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.420
You make me laugh.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.302
I'm just lucky
you didn't meet a clown

30:03.302 --> 30:04.723
before you met me.

30:05.925 --> 30:07.686
Of course.

30:07.686 --> 30:10.229
The way to Mom's heart
is through her funny bone.

30:10.229 --> 30:12.191
And I still don't know
what time it is.

30:13.432 --> 30:14.854
That's hilarious!

30:14.854 --> 30:16.435
Clown puppies.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.070
They also have
tiny clown bikes and pies.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.902
Oh, tiny clown pies.

30:22.902 --> 30:25.244
They look delicious.

30:25.244 --> 30:27.406
That's a poker chip
with shaving cream on it.

30:27.406 --> 30:30.289
Yes, I know that now.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.411
I told you she'd eat it.
I win the bet.

30:32.411 --> 30:33.913
You both have to read a book

30:33.913 --> 30:36.375
that's not a novelization
of a summer blockbuster

30:38.047 --> 30:39.418
Guys, I have to admit,

30:39.418 --> 30:41.050
when I became
Mayor of Puppy Town,

30:41.050 --> 30:42.051
I was honored

30:42.051 --> 30:43.462
and added it to my resume

30:43.462 --> 30:46.305
I haven't done much
in the last 10 years.

30:46.305 --> 30:49.308
But seeing how funny the puppies
are finally got me.

30:49.308 --> 30:51.310
And seeing
how much effort you guys

30:51.310 --> 30:52.601
put in over
the last few weeks

30:52.601 --> 30:55.184
really showed me
how much you care.

30:55.184 --> 30:56.976
When dad gets home,

30:56.976 --> 30:59.238
I'll tell him
we're keeping the puppies.

30:59.238 --> 31:02.611
All right,
I'm keeping my puppies!

31:02.611 --> 31:05.194
These puppies are hilarious.

31:11.790 --> 31:14.333
I've never been prouder.

31:17.336 --> 31:19.208
And so we'd like
to be the family

31:19.208 --> 31:20.259
that takes the puppies.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.301
I see.

31:23.342 --> 31:24.673
Uh-huh.

31:25.674 --> 31:27.096
Okay. Thanks.

31:28.427 --> 31:29.969
I'm sorry, kids.

31:29.969 --> 31:31.270
Heather's family

31:31.270 --> 31:32.932
has already given
the puppies to someone else.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.353
They're gone.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.328
"Two months ago, when Gracie
and Freddy were born,

31:49.328 --> 31:51.700
was the happiest day
of my life.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.203
Today, when they were
adopted by another family,

31:54.203 --> 31:55.914
was the saddest.

31:55.914 --> 31:58.377
Avery tried to find out
who Heather gave them to,

31:58.377 --> 32:00.919
but all Heather knew was
that it was some nice guy

32:00.919 --> 32:03.422
who answered their ad.

32:03.422 --> 32:06.005
I may never see
my puppies again."

32:06.005 --> 32:07.636
Hello, Stan.

32:07.636 --> 32:10.219
It's me,
your evil ex-owner, Ian.

32:10.219 --> 32:11.971
Not that I'm evil
from my perspective,

32:11.971 --> 32:13.512
but I thought the adjective
might help remind you

32:13.512 --> 32:15.604
who I am.

32:15.604 --> 32:18.978
I remember you, Ian.
What do you want?

32:18.978 --> 32:22.191
No, Stan,
it's what you want.

32:22.191 --> 32:24.363
( gasps )
My puppies!

32:24.363 --> 32:26.405
I adopted them from
that lovely girl Heather

32:26.405 --> 32:29.568
after I saw their baby photos
on your Buddy Bop page.

32:29.568 --> 32:31.410
Wait a minute,

32:31.410 --> 32:33.952
you're "Mad Scientist
You'll-See-You'll-All-See?"

32:33.952 --> 32:36.415
Why did I accept
your bop request?

32:37.626 --> 32:39.418
GLORIA: Ian!

32:39.418 --> 32:42.581
Excuse me, I'm staying
with my mother in Glendale.

32:42.581 --> 32:44.343
What, Mother?

32:45.794 --> 32:47.426
GLORIA:
It's late! Go to bed!

32:47.426 --> 32:49.548
How are you gonna make
scientific breakthroughs

32:49.548 --> 32:51.010
if you're not well-rested?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.351
You go to bed!

32:52.351 --> 32:54.053
If you're not well-rested,

32:54.053 --> 32:55.184
how are you gonna nag me
the rest of your life?

32:55.184 --> 32:57.936
So where were we?

32:57.936 --> 33:00.309
Right.
Your adorable puppies.

33:00.309 --> 33:02.061
Give them back to me, Ian.

33:02.061 --> 33:04.693
Of course.
If you give me what I want.

33:04.693 --> 33:06.695
Anything.
Anything at all.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.907
Sounds like we can
make a deal, then.

33:08.907 --> 33:11.490
GLORIA: Ian, who are you
talking to this late?

33:11.490 --> 33:13.322
The Nagging-Mother Police!

33:13.322 --> 33:14.953
They're coming
to get you!

33:16.955 --> 33:19.038
She's pretty sure there's
no Nagging-Mother Police,

33:19.038 --> 33:22.251
but not completely sure--
it's a fun game we play.

33:23.882 --> 33:27.046
Ian, why is there a dog
on your screen?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.632
( doorbell rings )

33:35.304 --> 33:37.015
Hello, Avery.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.097
Ian?

33:38.097 --> 33:39.308
What are you doing here?

33:39.308 --> 33:41.400
Are those Stan's puppies?
Well--

33:41.400 --> 33:43.352
Ian?
What are you doing here?

33:43.352 --> 33:45.644
Are those Stan's puppies?
Well--

33:45.644 --> 33:48.487
Ian, what are you doing here?
Are those Stan's puppies?

33:48.487 --> 33:51.320
It'd be really helpful if you
all entered at the same time.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.204
Okay,
let's get this over with.

33:55.204 --> 33:57.206
Stan, what is going on?

33:57.206 --> 33:59.418
Stan and I made a deal.

33:59.418 --> 34:01.370
I turn the puppies
over to you,

34:01.370 --> 34:04.373
and Stan comes with me
so I can resume my experiments

34:04.373 --> 34:06.755
to discover how he can talk.

34:06.755 --> 34:09.338
And this pet carrier
is chained to my wrist,

34:09.338 --> 34:12.431
to make sure there are no
shenanigans, like last time.

34:12.431 --> 34:15.594
Ugh, and I just thought up
the perfect shenanigan.

34:16.765 --> 34:18.677
Stan, you can't do this.

34:18.677 --> 34:20.179
You can't go with Ian.

34:20.179 --> 34:21.770
I have no choice, Avery.

34:21.770 --> 34:24.683
It's the only way to protect
Gracie and Freddy.

34:24.683 --> 34:27.276
Are you ready, Stan?
In a minute.

34:27.276 --> 34:29.528
There's something I need
to do before I leave.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.952
See, he's here.
He's trying to take Stan.

34:33.952 --> 34:35.494
You can't let him take Stan.

34:35.494 --> 34:37.956
Oh, I remember you.

34:37.956 --> 34:40.909
Honey, this is just the nice man
who used to own Stan.

34:40.909 --> 34:42.201
You must be mistaken.

34:42.201 --> 34:43.332
I'm sorry
about our daughter.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.504
She has quite
an imagination.

34:45.504 --> 34:47.166
Just ask Gustov.

34:47.166 --> 34:50.589
Are you calling'
my woman a liar?

34:50.589 --> 34:53.342
Gustov, please,
this isn't the time.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.344
Ugh.

34:55.344 --> 34:58.477
So, you came
to visit Stan again?

34:58.477 --> 35:01.680
Exactly! I don't know what
Chloe was talking about.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.222
Avery and I will visit
with Ian.

35:03.222 --> 35:04.353
Why don't you
and Mom go back

35:04.353 --> 35:06.395
to talking about
old people stuff,

35:06.395 --> 35:09.188
like escrow
and how bad your knees are?

35:09.188 --> 35:10.819
He's not wrong.

35:10.819 --> 35:12.861
I feel a rain coming on.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.193
I hope it doesn't interfere
with our meeting

35:14.193 --> 35:16.195
with the notary.

35:16.195 --> 35:18.907
Tyler, I know
what you're trying to do

35:18.907 --> 35:20.199
getting Mom and Dad
out of the room.

35:20.199 --> 35:22.241
It's to protect our secret.

35:22.241 --> 35:24.583
But there are worse things
than them finding out.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.416
Avery, no.
And Ian taking Stan

35:27.416 --> 35:29.248
is the worst thing of all.

35:31.009 --> 35:33.011
Maybe this is it.

35:33.011 --> 35:35.594
Maybe this is the time
for them to find out.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.095
What secret?

35:37.095 --> 35:40.259
The secret that your dog
can talk, of course.

35:40.259 --> 35:41.390
TOGETHER:
What?

35:41.390 --> 35:43.392
I am a scientist
on the verge of making

35:43.392 --> 35:46.355
the most important breakthrough
of the 21st century.

35:46.355 --> 35:49.478
Your dog is the world's
first talking dog,

35:49.478 --> 35:51.690
and I am gonna find out
how he does it,

35:51.690 --> 35:53.902
so I can make
other dogs talk.

35:53.902 --> 35:56.275
I'll become rich
and famous,

35:56.275 --> 35:59.238
and finally have
someone to talk to.

35:59.238 --> 36:01.039
Wait a minute.

36:01.039 --> 36:04.453
Are you saying that
Stan is a talking dog?

36:04.453 --> 36:07.416
Surely, there have been
mysterious goings on.

36:07.416 --> 36:10.289
Voices you've heard,
unexplained happenings.

36:10.289 --> 36:12.341
The ghost we heard
last Halloween.

36:12.341 --> 36:14.593
The hang glider that got
charged to my credit card.

36:14.593 --> 36:16.004
When we first got Stan

36:16.004 --> 36:17.386
and Chloe told us
he was a talking dog.

36:17.386 --> 36:19.798
That one really should've
tipped us off.

36:21.350 --> 36:22.641
Stan talks.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.682
And sings.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.894
Dancing...

36:27.306 --> 36:29.107
How could you have
kept this from us?

36:29.107 --> 36:30.859
We were afraid
of what you would do.

36:30.859 --> 36:32.981
But we have
a bigger problem now.

36:32.981 --> 36:34.773
Ian has Gracie and Freddy,

36:34.773 --> 36:36.575
and wants to
exchange them for Stan.

36:36.575 --> 36:38.407
You can't let him have Stan.

36:38.407 --> 36:39.868
The kids are emotional.

36:39.868 --> 36:41.950
It's understandable,
they're kids.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.873
Bennett,
we're men of science.

36:44.873 --> 36:48.206
I have PhDs
in biology, zoology,

36:48.206 --> 36:49.708
and theater arts,

36:49.708 --> 36:52.591
in case the science thing
doesn't work out.

36:52.591 --> 36:54.673
I am a man of science.

36:54.673 --> 36:56.425
And I do have
a subscription series

36:56.425 --> 36:59.388
to the Pasadena Playhouse.
Dad?

36:59.388 --> 37:01.930
Yeah, given
the remarkable miracle

37:01.930 --> 37:03.392
that Stan represents,

37:03.392 --> 37:06.014
don't you agree
the only responsible thing

37:06.014 --> 37:08.226
to do is to turn him
over to a man of science,

37:08.226 --> 37:09.608
such as myself?

37:12.351 --> 37:13.852
I'm sorry, kids.

37:13.852 --> 37:15.524
Ian has a point.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.276
A talking dog could be

37:17.276 --> 37:20.409
one of the greatest
scientific discoveries ever.

37:20.409 --> 37:24.573
Having Stan go with a scientist
is the responsible thing to do.

37:32.210 --> 37:35.083
Kids, since I won't be around
when you're growing up,

37:35.083 --> 37:38.086
I just wanted to teach you
a few life lessons.

37:38.086 --> 37:40.299
This is how you
pickle a herring.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.802
I think.

37:43.802 --> 37:45.764
I'm just guessing
from the words.

37:48.647 --> 37:51.350
So, when do you think I can
take Stan and be on my way?

37:51.350 --> 37:54.232
Soon, I'm sure.
But what's the rush?

37:54.232 --> 37:57.356
I so rarely get to converse
with a fellow man of science.

37:57.356 --> 37:59.528
My whole career,

37:59.528 --> 38:01.279
I've hoped for a breakthrough
in my field,

38:01.279 --> 38:02.821
like the one
you're on the verge of.

38:02.821 --> 38:05.704
Perhaps a psychological
disorder that I could name

38:05.704 --> 38:07.956
"The Bennetts."

38:07.956 --> 38:10.168
But nothing that gives me
the heebie jeebies.

38:10.168 --> 38:11.460
Which, of course,
was discovered

38:11.460 --> 38:14.713
by the team of Fred Heebie
and Bill Jeebie.

38:14.713 --> 38:17.045
They're so lucky.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.256
So yeah, um,

38:18.256 --> 38:20.719
about getting Stan
and being on my way.

38:20.719 --> 38:23.051
Oh, we rarely
have company.

38:23.051 --> 38:25.093
I can't imagine why.

38:25.093 --> 38:28.807
I may not be a man of science
or have all the degrees you do,

38:28.807 --> 38:31.480
but I am
the Mayor of Puppy Town.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.852
It's right here
on my resume.

38:33.852 --> 38:37.235
Maybe we could go look for Stan
and see what the holdup is.

38:37.235 --> 38:39.237
I've got to get back to
my mother's house in Glendale.

38:39.237 --> 38:40.939
A mother in Glendale?

38:40.939 --> 38:43.362
She must be so impressed
by your research.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.493
My mother is gonna be proud

38:44.493 --> 38:46.204
when I tell her about
"The Bennetts."

38:46.204 --> 38:47.616
It would be nice
if it was something

38:47.616 --> 38:49.538
that could be cured by quilting.

38:49.538 --> 38:51.329
She loves that.

38:52.411 --> 38:55.163
Where's the dog?

38:55.163 --> 38:57.716
'Cause I can't wait to get back
to my mother's house.

38:57.716 --> 38:59.458
She doesn't believe
in my work at all.

38:59.458 --> 39:03.301
So Stan's gonna tell her,
"Your son's a genius!"

39:03.301 --> 39:05.554
Now rub my belly.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.345
Just to be clear,
that's still the dog

39:07.345 --> 39:09.558
talking to my mother,
and not me talking to you.

39:10.929 --> 39:13.181
Stan,
come here, boy.

39:13.181 --> 39:16.104
Well, you two men
of science chat.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.816
I'm gonna go think through
all the embarrassing things

39:17.816 --> 39:19.398
I did when I thought
I was alone with a dumb dog

39:19.398 --> 39:21.400
who couldn't
tell anyone about it.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.033
Oh, boy, he saw
my chicken impression.

39:25.033 --> 39:27.195
( imitating chicken )

39:31.369 --> 39:34.413
Please, tell me
where your dog is!

39:39.127 --> 39:40.759
Avery, what is it?
I wanted to finish the video

39:40.759 --> 39:42.300
I was making my kids.

39:42.300 --> 39:44.803
Stan, you can't do this.
You can't go with Ian.

39:44.803 --> 39:47.806
Just run away and hide
so he can't take you.

39:47.806 --> 39:49.267
Yeah, Stan.
Run away.

39:49.267 --> 39:53.391
Like my kinfolk
do on teeth pulling day.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.393
What, Chloe gets
to do characters,

39:55.393 --> 39:57.606
but I can't do
Huckleberry Tyler?

39:57.606 --> 40:01.359
Well, that makes me madder
than a possum in a tar barrel!

40:02.481 --> 40:03.822
If I do run away,

40:03.822 --> 40:05.694
what happens
to Gracie and Freddy?

40:05.694 --> 40:07.285
We love Gracie
and Freddy, too.

40:07.285 --> 40:08.697
We'll figure something out.

40:08.697 --> 40:09.988
There's nothing
to figure out.

40:09.988 --> 40:11.950
This is the only way
to protect them.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.412
Now I'm gonna go
finish my video.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.624
I don't know
how I'm gonna teach them

40:15.624 --> 40:18.246
the art of puppetry
in one afternoon.

40:20.539 --> 40:23.211
But I'm gonna give it a try.

40:23.211 --> 40:24.753
I'll say good-bye
before I go.

40:24.753 --> 40:27.636
I won't.
I'm uncomfortable with emotion.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.392
We can't let Ian take Stan
or the puppies.

40:34.392 --> 40:35.894
And we're not
going to, Chloe.

40:35.894 --> 40:37.225
First, we'll take the puppies,

40:37.225 --> 40:39.357
then Stan will have
no reason to leave.

40:39.357 --> 40:41.319
But Ian has them
chained to his wrist.

40:41.319 --> 40:42.941
See?

40:44.192 --> 40:46.024
There's a bolt cutters
in the garage

40:46.024 --> 40:47.405
we can use to cut the chain.

40:47.405 --> 40:49.197
Like so.

40:51.279 --> 40:54.202
Yay, Avery, you're playing
dolls with me.

40:54.202 --> 40:56.495
He'll never stand by
while we do that.

40:56.495 --> 40:58.206
We need a diversion.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.377
Look over there!

41:02.631 --> 41:05.584
Or maybe we can use Gustov.

41:05.584 --> 41:08.256
I think you've
outgrown me, Chloe,

41:08.256 --> 41:12.260
so I'm gonna fly out the window
and find another kid.

41:13.431 --> 41:14.803
Bye, Gustov.

41:14.803 --> 41:16.184
Tyler, get out of the way.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.057
Oh, no.

41:19.057 --> 41:20.438
I'm just kidding.

41:20.438 --> 41:23.401
That's right, Tyler.
Tell 'em that.

41:24.603 --> 41:26.274
Are you sure our dog talks

41:26.274 --> 41:28.236
and we're not just all
out of our minds?

41:29.908 --> 41:32.490
( thud )
Aah!

41:32.490 --> 41:35.824
Cartwheels are hard for a dog,
but you get the idea.

41:37.285 --> 41:39.998
I have just a few more
things to teach you.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.210
You carry a lot of tension
in your back.

41:43.381 --> 41:45.123
Oh, that's good.

41:45.123 --> 41:47.045
Oh, really get in there.

41:48.797 --> 41:53.221
And that's how you do puppetry
and shiatsu massage.

41:53.221 --> 41:55.393
Sorry, I had
to combine the two.

41:55.393 --> 41:57.095
I've got a lot
to get through.

41:58.597 --> 42:00.268
This is how you sneak
under laser beams

42:00.268 --> 42:02.901
if you're stealing jewels
from a museum.

42:07.405 --> 42:09.778
Gracie, Freddy,

42:09.778 --> 42:12.360
the most important thing
for me to tell you

42:12.360 --> 42:15.153
is that when I'm gone,
it's gonna be up to you

42:15.153 --> 42:17.415
to take care of Avery,
Tyler, and Chloe.

42:17.415 --> 42:22.661
Now, those kids mean
more to me than anything.

42:22.661 --> 42:24.713
Well,
until I met the two of you.

42:29.377 --> 42:31.379
But then I decided I didn't
want anything associated

42:31.379 --> 42:34.132
with explosive
diarrhea to be called

42:34.132 --> 42:35.634
"The Bennetts."

42:35.634 --> 42:37.726
I made the deal.

42:37.726 --> 42:40.058
I was gonna leave the puppies
and take the dog.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.100
It seemed so simple.

42:42.100 --> 42:43.642
I'm back.

42:43.642 --> 42:46.274
And I found her
and got her to come with me.

42:46.274 --> 42:47.275
Ian...

42:47.275 --> 42:48.316
Mom!

42:49.858 --> 42:50.949
What are you doing here?

42:50.949 --> 42:52.490
What are you doing here?

42:52.490 --> 42:54.072
This lovely,
young lady--

42:54.072 --> 42:56.454
She said
"lovely, young."

42:56.454 --> 42:58.326
I wish you were my mother.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.700
This lovely, young,
slightly needy lady

43:01.700 --> 43:03.622
said that you were trying
to take their dog,

43:03.622 --> 43:06.044
and that you chained
their puppies to your wrist.

43:06.044 --> 43:07.545
Mother,
I am on the verge

43:07.545 --> 43:09.377
of the most important
scientific breakthrough--

43:09.377 --> 43:12.300
Oh, Ian, not the talking-dog
thing again.

43:12.300 --> 43:15.383
Why did I let you watch
so many cartoons as a kid?

43:15.383 --> 43:16.344
I will only eat
my Brussels sprouts

43:16.344 --> 43:17.766
while I'm watching cartoons.

43:17.766 --> 43:19.517
That's the deal
and you know it!

43:19.517 --> 43:21.219
And talking dogs are real.

43:21.219 --> 43:23.311
Get ready for me to say,
"Bam, in your face, Mother."

43:23.311 --> 43:26.434
Yeah, there will be
no bamming in my face.

43:26.434 --> 43:28.647
And no more bothering
these nice people.

43:28.647 --> 43:31.529
Now unchain the puppies
from your wrist.

43:31.529 --> 43:35.033
I can't believe I'm actually
saying that sentence.

43:35.033 --> 43:36.404
Yes, Mother.

43:36.404 --> 43:39.197
I promise,
he will never bother you again.

43:39.197 --> 43:40.408
Come, Ian.

43:40.408 --> 43:41.790
Yes, Mother.

43:41.790 --> 43:43.081
Ow!

43:43.081 --> 43:44.242
Bye, Gloria!

43:44.242 --> 43:45.794
Farmers Market
this Saturday?

43:45.794 --> 43:47.165
Stop being needy!

43:47.165 --> 43:49.207
No, you're the best!

43:50.959 --> 43:53.251
You got rid of him
and saved the puppies.

43:53.251 --> 43:56.384
Stan, it's all all right.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.636
We got rid of Ian
and your puppies are safe.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.558
STAN: Freddy, Gracie!
Thank goodness!

44:00.558 --> 44:02.520
I love you both so much.

44:02.520 --> 44:04.432
We weren't going
to let that guy take Stan.

44:04.432 --> 44:05.894
I was just stalling him

44:05.894 --> 44:07.896
while your mother
went to find his mother.

44:07.896 --> 44:11.399
That's right, we used the most
powerful force there is:

44:11.399 --> 44:13.692
Mother Power.
Mama Powa.

44:13.692 --> 44:15.734
The Maternal
Combustion Engine.

44:15.734 --> 44:17.826
I want another baby,
Bennett.

44:19.487 --> 44:23.081
So as for the secret,
now that you know...

44:23.081 --> 44:25.914
It's time for me
to formally introduce myself.

44:25.914 --> 44:28.747
And you kids
played along great.

44:28.747 --> 44:31.129
We had no idea
what good actors you are.

44:31.129 --> 44:32.290
Actors?

44:32.290 --> 44:33.882
Yeah, the way
you followed our lead

44:33.882 --> 44:35.383
when we were humoring Ian,

44:35.383 --> 44:37.255
pretending
that he wasn't nuts,

44:37.255 --> 44:40.258
and that we actually believed
him that Stan could talk,

44:40.258 --> 44:42.260
until we could figure out
a way to get rid of him.

44:42.260 --> 44:44.853
That's right,
we played along.

44:44.853 --> 44:46.304
Pretending to believe.

44:46.304 --> 44:48.686
Stan can't talk.
That's bananas.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.308
Woo-hoo-hoo!

44:54.522 --> 44:56.154
I'll stop now.

44:57.405 --> 44:59.197
And your father
was great too,

44:59.197 --> 45:01.870
with all that crazy talk
about "The Bennetts."

45:01.870 --> 45:03.411
What a perfect diversion.

45:03.411 --> 45:06.124
Yeah. Crazy talk.

45:06.124 --> 45:09.627
Not a serious yearning
for professional accomplishment.

45:09.627 --> 45:11.379
Just a diversion.

45:12.961 --> 45:15.133
Diversion.
Oh, no.

45:15.133 --> 45:17.045
Hey, what secret
were you talking about?

45:17.045 --> 45:20.178
Shenanigan!
Shenanigan!

45:20.178 --> 45:22.180
Whoa! Whoa!

45:27.305 --> 45:29.687
Guys, Ian is gone!

45:29.687 --> 45:31.770
The puppies
and Stan are okay.

45:31.770 --> 45:33.691
What is going on?

45:33.691 --> 45:35.483
Well...

45:35.483 --> 45:37.315
this is the secret.

45:37.315 --> 45:38.907
Sometimes
when you're gone,

45:38.907 --> 45:41.409
Tyler flies around
in a fairy costume...

45:43.361 --> 45:46.744
while Chloe tries to cut him
down with bolt cutters.

45:48.326 --> 45:50.578
Yep, that's the secret.

45:50.578 --> 45:52.040
What other secret
could there be?

45:52.040 --> 45:53.711
Tyler has a monster in him.

45:55.173 --> 45:57.425
Tyler,
get down from there.

45:57.425 --> 45:59.047
Chloe,
give me those bolt cutters.

45:59.047 --> 46:01.259
We are going to discuss
some consequences for this.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.011
What are you doing?

46:03.011 --> 46:04.182
You were supposed to
ride in with the bolt cutters

46:04.182 --> 46:05.844
to free the puppies,

46:05.844 --> 46:08.266
while Chloe flew in
wearing the fairy costume.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.267
Oh.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.769
That makes a lot more sense.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.062
This costume is riding up
on me something fierce.

46:16.064 --> 46:17.655
Imagine if Stan
really could talk.

46:17.655 --> 46:19.357
How crazy would that be?

46:19.357 --> 46:22.660
Not that you kids could actually
keep a secret like that from us.

46:22.660 --> 46:24.072
No.
Of course not.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.663
Not for more
than three years.

46:26.995 --> 46:28.786
And, of course,
if Stan could talk,

46:28.786 --> 46:30.288
we would
have to send him off

46:30.288 --> 46:31.369
to be experimented on.

46:31.369 --> 46:32.911
You're so funny.

46:32.911 --> 46:34.412
I know
you're just joking, Dad.

46:34.412 --> 46:36.254
That's a chance
we're never gonna take.

46:39.627 --> 46:42.050
Preparing to leave the kids
I love so much

46:42.050 --> 46:44.262
to save the puppies
I love so much

46:44.262 --> 46:45.383
was probably
the hardest thing

46:45.383 --> 46:47.265
I've ever had to do.

46:47.265 --> 46:52.230
But fortunately, everything
adfoasir jweqrl nweapo rif.

46:52.230 --> 46:54.272
What the--

46:55.773 --> 46:58.776
Not now, kids,
Daddy's blogging.

47:00.398 --> 47:03.321
Fatherhood is
not going to be easy.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.572
But it's worth it.
