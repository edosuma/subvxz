WEBVTT

00:01.417 --> 00:04.208
-Come on, I'm going to be late.
Let's go!

00:04.250 --> 00:06.667
[Gerry]: Ah, about time!
Finally!

00:06.709 --> 00:09.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Alright, we're gonna hold it
right there.

00:09.458 --> 00:12.000
-Seriously, why are you
stopping me?
-Safety first, pal.

00:12.041 --> 00:13.959
-Safety first.
That's ridiculous!

00:14.000 --> 00:16.291
And there's nobody at the other
end. There's no cars waiting.

00:16.333 --> 00:20.041
-Let me go.
-You'll get there when you
get there, alright Mr. Big Shot?

00:20.083 --> 00:22.834
Cool your jets.
-Cool my jets?

00:22.875 --> 00:25.917
Can I see a supervisor please?
This is ridiculous!
You're in trouble.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.166
-Big George!
-Yeah, Big George.

00:28.208 --> 00:31.166
-This gentleman requires a word.

00:31.208 --> 00:33.125
-We'll see what happens to you.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.542
-[Voice is high-pitched]:
Is there a problem?
-You're Big George?

00:35.583 --> 00:38.667
Yeah. He let one car go,
then he stopped me.

00:38.709 --> 00:41.083
Now there's no cars and he still
stopped me again.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.208
-That's what he's supposed
to do, sir.
-Thank you.

00:43.250 --> 00:46.583
-How is that what he's
supposed to do? First of all,
you're not even doing anything.

00:46.625 --> 00:49.083
He was rude to me, how
about that? Ahhh!?

00:49.125 --> 00:51.709
-Tony, were you rude
to this man?

00:51.750 --> 00:53.750
-Look at 'im.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.250
-Listen, between you and me?
I hate his guts.
-He loves me.

00:56.291 --> 00:59.000
-He's always late, he's
disrespectful to his coworkers.

00:59.041 --> 01:02.125
And, he calls me "Big George".
-Big George!

01:02.166 --> 01:04.667
-You think that doesn't sting?
I know what I look like.

01:04.709 --> 01:07.041
-You fire him, when they're
like that you fire him.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.208
-He's union, there's
nothing I can do.

01:09.250 --> 01:11.625
-Union? What does that
have to do with it?

01:11.667 --> 01:14.250
-There's nothing I can do.
-Pft.

01:14.291 --> 01:17.250
-Ahhhhhh.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.625
-Wow. You're hilarious.
-Okay go. Let's go.

01:21.667 --> 01:25.709
-Let's go, let's go. Let's go.
Put the brakes on that, honey.

-[Simon]: Ah, Gerry!
-You know what?

01:41.458 --> 01:43.625
I can't talk right now okay,
'cause I'm late.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.834
-Okay, just real quick.
So my mom and I host this

01:45.875 --> 01:48.458
monthly soiree, Chez Hunt and
she's currently painting the

01:48.500 --> 01:50.709
living room sort of this
fine shade of taupe.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.250
-Okay, hurry up, what?
-Anyway, what with the wet paint

01:53.291 --> 01:56.250
and me being your landlord,
I was hoping that we could

01:56.291 --> 01:58.583
host the party tomorrow night at
your place?

01:58.625 --> 02:00.875
-Why would I do that?
-Because we're friends.

02:00.917 --> 02:03.250
-Noo.
-No, we can't host the party
at your place?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.500
Or, no we're not friends?
-Gerry!

02:05.542 --> 02:07.834
-[Gerry whispers]: Oh great.
-You're supposed to be in class.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.041
What are you doing?
-I was going to class, okay?

02:10.083 --> 02:12.375
But Simon's grandfather
just passed away.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.542
And I was consoling him.

02:14.583 --> 02:17.250
Sorry about that. Right?
-Ohhh.

02:17.291 --> 02:19.542
-Died again?
-Yeah...

02:19.583 --> 02:21.625
-Don't, why would you do that?
-He's gone again.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.208
-Yes, yes. Okay.
-This is the third time this
week.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.625
-[Gerry]: Okay...
-You cannot keep showing
up late like this.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.166
Do not make me warn you again.
-[Gerry]: Okay. Alright.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.458
[Gerry]: Oh my God!
-Wow.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.792
-That was rough. What do
you think she meant by that?
You think she'll fire you again?

02:35.834 --> 02:38.125
-No, she's not going to fire me
again for being late.
But I gotta go.

02:38.166 --> 02:40.875
-Can you get fired twice
from the same job?
-Okay, I gotta go.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.667
-Closed!

02:44.709 --> 02:48.333
Go the other way! This one
is closed until tomorrow.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.500
Walk, walk.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:50.542 --> 02:52.458
-Yes?
-What do you mean, closed?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.542
-I already clean this hallway so
I closed it. The kids they go
the other way.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.709
-It's the middle of the school
day.

02:57.750 --> 03:00.000
You can't go around just
shutting down parts
of the school.

03:00.041 --> 03:02.250
-But, this is the only way
I can finish by seven.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.875
The school is too big for
me to...

03:04.917 --> 03:08.333
You know, clean by myself.
-Mr. Malik, help me, help you.

03:08.375 --> 03:11.709
Show up earlier. Work harder,
work smarter.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.917
I don't know, just find a way.
-I have life outside work.

03:14.959 --> 03:18.875
My boys, depend on me.
-Let me put it this way to you.

03:18.917 --> 03:22.208
Either, you find a way
to do your job,

03:22.250 --> 03:25.250
or I. Will. Find.

03:25.291 --> 03:28.583
Someone. Else. Who. Can.

03:30.917 --> 03:33.000
-Ohhh!

03:35.291 --> 03:37.166
Careful, it's wet.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.000
You are the bane of my
existence.

03:40.041 --> 03:42.291
-We're going to mix things
up a little bit today.

03:42.333 --> 03:46.083
I'd like to talk about unions.
-Sir, we're supposed to be
discussing Kantian ethics today.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.375
-Yeah, you know what? I Kantian
deal with you sometimes.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.625
So, that's the discussion over.

03:50.667 --> 03:54.083
And, very rude to interrupt me,
especially in an ethics class.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.041
So, that's unethical.

03:56.083 --> 04:00.583
Unions, who can tell me
everything they know about
unions.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.166
-During the industrial
revolution, working conditions

04:03.208 --> 04:06.166
were incredibly poor...
-Yeah, I'm gonna cut you off
right there, Sheila.

04:06.208 --> 04:08.750
I don't really care what
happened in the 1200's
or whatever.

04:08.792 --> 04:12.208
Here's a good question, let's
see if you know this.
How do you start a union?

04:12.250 --> 04:14.792
I will give you five
participation marks if you...

04:14.834 --> 04:17.000
Lori, how do you form a union?

04:17.041 --> 04:19.959
-To form a union, you need a
vote of fifty percent plus one
in support.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.542
-Fifty percent? Plus one. So,
fifty one percent. Thank you.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.709
Of the votes, and you
get a union.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.917
-Sir, it's fifty percent plus
one.

04:27.959 --> 04:32.834
-Fifty percent plus one is not
the same as fifty one percent.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.709
So, apparently, I'm an idiot.

04:35.750 --> 04:39.625
You might want to brush up
on your math skills, like you're
grade one math skills.

04:39.667 --> 04:42.250
-Sir, it's not the same thing.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.458
Fifty percent plus one vote.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.208
-Fifty plus one is...

04:47.250 --> 04:51.417
[Claps]: Fifty one! What? Yes,
still. Hey, let's have a vote.

04:51.458 --> 04:57.083
Who's tired of Sheila just
talking gibberish all the
time, for no reason?

04:57.125 --> 04:59.375
Thank you, Darcy.

04:59.417 --> 05:04.166
-That's one vote. Now you
need another fifty percent
for me to...

05:04.208 --> 05:06.417
Stop with the gibberish.
-I get it.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.959
Alright, fair enough.
We're saying the same
thing differently.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.166
I want you to read chapter five
for a bit.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.333
'Cause that's probably coming
up in the year somewhere.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.875
So let's get a head start on
that. I gotta do a little more
research on unions.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.834
'Cause I want to give you some
more challenging questions.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.917
-Sir, what about my five
extra bonus marks?

05:22.959 --> 05:26.291
-And Lori, gets five extra
participation marks.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.834
-Can you write it down in
your book so you don't forget?

05:29.875 --> 05:33.083
-It's in my book Lori, okay?
I don't need to go write it
down on a piece of paper.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.166
That's my book. Everything's
in there in different parts of
my head.

05:36.208 --> 05:39.875
That's how teachers roll.
Now it's four.

05:39.917 --> 05:42.000
Mmm!

05:44.417 --> 05:47.250
-Been there. It's not happening.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.500
-[Lisa and Ed laughing]

05:50.542 --> 05:52.500
-Hey Lisa, you met Ed.
-[Lisa laughs]

05:52.542 --> 05:55.083
I can't believe you haven't
mentioned your brother before.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.208
We have so much in common.
-Oh, sorry Ed.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.166
I didn't realize things had
gotten so bad.

05:59.208 --> 06:01.875
-She's such a joker.
Turns out we're both Libras,

06:01.917 --> 06:04.083
we both love Norwegian Cinema,
and...

06:04.125 --> 06:07.041
-We're cat people!
-[Trudy]: Oh.
-[All laugh]

06:07.083 --> 06:09.291
-So you just figured
all that out now, huh?

06:09.333 --> 06:12.750
-When you click, you click,
right? It's like what the
Norwegian's say...

06:12.792 --> 06:16.000
Jeg er sa ensomme.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.792
-Anyway, I gotta get going.
Lisa, we'll see you on Friday.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.083
-Oh, Trudy, could you check
my schedule for Friday?

06:23.125 --> 06:26.333
-[Laughs]: Yeah, right.

06:26.375 --> 06:29.166
Oh, okay.
Ya got nothin'.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.500
-Oh, this is a slow week. It's
next week that's really busy.

06:32.542 --> 06:35.291
-No it isn't. You're free.
All year.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.291
Absolutely nothing.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.458
-Two Friday's in a row
I'm all yours.
[Laughs]

06:40.500 --> 06:42.792
-Until Friday then.
-Oh, oh my.

06:42.834 --> 06:45.291
-[Ed and Lisa laugh]

06:45.333 --> 06:47.750
-See ya, sis.
-Yeah.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.667
-Dette er super forvirrende.

06:55.709 --> 06:58.208
-What are you doing, Gerry?
-Hi.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.709
-Oh! Gerry, come on!

07:00.750 --> 07:02.875
My sandwich!

07:02.917 --> 07:05.375
-Does that say onion?
-What?

07:05.417 --> 07:07.625
Union.
-Looks like onion.

07:07.667 --> 07:10.041
That's clearly an 'o'. Look at
the curvature over the top.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.750
-It's a 'u', Emma! Why would I
stand on the table and hold up
a sign that says onion?

07:13.792 --> 07:17.291
-I don't know Gerry. Why would
you stand on a table with a sign
that says union?

07:17.333 --> 07:19.875
-'Cause we're starting one,
here at the school.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.041
-Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa.
What are you doing here?

07:22.083 --> 07:24.291
-Two words, Bobbi.
Job. Security.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.208
Without a union,
we don't have any.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.166
-Okay, just talking about this
is threatening your job.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.375
Not to mention the paying
your dues and going to meetings.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.583
It's a serious pain.
-It's not a lot of meetings.

07:33.625 --> 07:36.583
-It's been awhile since I
fought the man, let's do this!
-[Teachers]: Yeah!

07:36.625 --> 07:38.542
-You can all fight me,
but we're doing this.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.166
And if you're in a union you
don't have to go to the
meetings.

07:41.208 --> 07:44.125
-Great, yes, yeah, way to
bring people together, Gerry.

07:44.166 --> 07:47.250
-I love the commitment.
Union, yeah!

07:47.291 --> 07:49.208
-I'll tell you what, I gotta
get down because this...

07:49.250 --> 07:51.625
Ya ever hold something
over your head like that?

07:51.667 --> 07:54.125
Oh my God. Forget the
Norma Jean reference.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.667
It is hard to hold that,
I should have just held it here.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.083
-Norma Jean?
-The union girl?

07:59.125 --> 08:01.583
-Sally Field?
-No, that's Norma Rae.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.083
-Norma Rae! Norma Rae.
Who was Norma Jean?

08:04.125 --> 08:06.750
-Norma Jean is Marilyn Monroe.
-Marilyn Monroe.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.083
Marilyn Monroe wanted a union.
-No!

08:09.125 --> 08:11.291
-Ted Kennedy said no,
so they shot him...

08:11.333 --> 08:14.291
From a library. And that's why
the whole Kennedy thing
happened.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.542
He didn't and he got shot
by the union boss.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.333
-Oh my God! NO! Norma Jean,
Marilyn Monroe, did not want
a union.

08:20.375 --> 08:24.125
And it's John Kennedy!
-Norma Rae brought it to
their attention.

08:24.166 --> 08:26.125
-Norma Rae...
-Learn your history.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.333
-How are you a teacher?
-What are you talking about?

08:28.375 --> 08:30.750
How are you...? You go
to teachers college, Bobbi.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.041
[♪ Music]
-That's how I became a teacher.

08:33.417 --> 08:35.375
[♪ Music]

08:35.417 --> 08:38.250
-That guy reuses his tea bags,
he's not going to pay union
dues.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.208
No, Dwyer's ours for sure.
-So, what does that leave us at?

08:41.250 --> 08:44.458
-Well, fourteen for no union.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.041
And fourteen for yes union.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.375
-[Gerry]: Who are we missing?

08:49.417 --> 08:52.250
-Simon.
-Well, speak to him.

08:52.291 --> 08:55.000
-He'll say yes for sure, he does
everything I tell him to do.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.208
-I wouldn't be so sure.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.250
-Hey, Simon? Come here bud.
-You want to talk to me?

08:59.291 --> 09:01.667
-Come on over here Simon.
Come on.
-Come on over here you, kiddo.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.875
[Gerry]: Come here good boy.
-Hey, Simon! Have a seat here.

09:04.917 --> 09:06.834
Right here buds.
Have a little seat here.
-No.

09:06.875 --> 09:09.834
-[Bobbi]: That's fun. Yeah!
-[Gerry]: Simon, we called
you first.

09:09.875 --> 09:13.458
Who has cookies? Who has
a cookie? Who has a cookie?
No peanuts.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.959
-[Emma]: Mmmm.
-[Funny voice]: But then there's
this guy.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.125
Mrah, Simon's my best buddy.
-[Simon laughs]

09:18.166 --> 09:21.875
-[Bobbi laughs]: I love Simon.
-This is fun!

09:21.917 --> 09:24.166
-Where were they?
-The door.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.417
-Classic.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.333
-Lisa! Looking forward
to Friday.

-The kissing, Trudy.
On the lips?

-It's weird, Trudy!

can't compete with you.

the mouth? Why not the cheek?

big deal to you?
-Kind of.

do that around you anymore?

they are, they just...
