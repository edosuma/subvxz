00:04.352 --> 00:06.745
Previously on "The InBetween"...

00:06.789 --> 00:09.052
Cassie has certain abilities
that can be very helpful.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.836
She's over here!

00:10.880 --> 00:12.577
She's still alive.

00:12.621 --> 00:14.449
- Who's Sally?
- My fiancÃ©e.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.754
Or at least she was gonna be.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.147
She fell into a coma.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.757
I'm waiting for her
to come back to me.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.455
I see ghosts.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.500
- I hear them.
- Cassie!

00:23.762 --> 00:25.199
Sometimes they send me
a message,

00:25.242 --> 00:26.678
and sometimes they just show up.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.159
If you find yourself
wanting a little help

00:29.203 --> 00:31.161
from my side,

00:31.205 --> 00:32.728
just give me a holler.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.819 --> 01:22.908
Help me! Somebody!

01:22.952 --> 01:26.782
Let me out!

01:36.096 --> 01:37.696
Is there anything else
you can tell us?

01:37.720 --> 01:39.403
A bobblehead?

01:39.447 --> 01:42.406
What, like those giveaway
things at the ballpark?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.887
Yeah.
No, it doesn't ring any bells.

01:44.930 --> 01:47.716
But a car fire... definitely.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.371
Listen, I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

01:50.414 --> 01:51.894
You talk to the housekeeper?
Yeah.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.592
She said Neil Stern was headed
out to the gym.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.159
She heard an explosion, ran out,

01:56.203 --> 01:57.508
and found the car on fire.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.293
Neil Stern was screaming
for help.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.946
But when he turned on
the ignition,

02:00.990 --> 02:02.252
the doors automatically locked.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.427
Yeah, once the fire began,

02:03.471 --> 02:05.429
the electrical system
shorted out.

02:05.473 --> 02:06.865
He couldn't unlock them again.

02:06.909 --> 02:10.608
This is Gio Salonga.
He's the Sterns' contractor.

02:10.651 --> 02:14.134
Neil told me I could come by
today to pick up my tools.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.222
What happened?

02:15.265 --> 02:16.788
We're still looking into it.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.660
How long have you been working
for the Sterns?

02:18.703 --> 02:19.704
About five months.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.402
They hired me to
do some renovations,

02:21.445 --> 02:22.885
but they fought so much
about it that

02:22.925 --> 02:24.845
they ended up separating
halfway through the job.

02:24.869 --> 02:27.843
- When did Mrs. Stern move out?
- About six weeks ago.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.367
Neil wanted to finish the work
on the house, sell it,

02:30.411 --> 02:31.847
and split the profits,

02:31.890 --> 02:35.024
but LydiaMrs. Stern...
She really loves this place

02:35.067 --> 02:36.199
and wanted to keep it.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.679
If the job's not done,

02:37.722 --> 02:39.550
why are you here for your tools?

02:39.594 --> 02:42.553
- I quit, actually, last week.
- How come?

02:42.597 --> 02:44.294
It was just getting to be
too much.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.862
The last straw was
an infestation of fire ants.

02:46.905 --> 02:50.518
Neil said me and my team should
be able to handle it for free.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.911
I said no. Can I get my tools?

02:52.955 --> 02:54.835
Not until we're finished
with the crime scene.

02:54.859 --> 02:56.654
I'll take your statement
over here.

02:56.698 --> 02:59.091
Thank you.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.695
All right,
so fire investigators think

03:00.739 --> 03:01.870
the ignition was rigged.

03:01.914 --> 03:03.313
Maybe an accelerant was used.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.837
So this is definitely a murder.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.971
With Neil Stern dead,
the house is off the market.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.540
Question is, how bad
did Mrs. Stern want back in?

03:14.803 --> 03:18.676
Hey, Will, sorry I'm late.
I got hung up on the...

03:18.720 --> 03:19.895
hey.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.331
You're not Will.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.724
I'm Andie.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.856
Will's mom got sick,
so Carl asked me to fill in.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.423
I'm Cassie.
It's nice to meet you.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.080
Wow. That came on sudden.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.168
- You okay?
- Yeah.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.302
I just got this... headache.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.347
I got some aspirin
in the kitchen.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.393
I get those too. Migraines.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.003
I have some medicine...
No, no, no.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.310
It's fine. Just be a sec.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.365
I... I can't believe this.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.280
Was there something wrong
with the car?

03:57.324 --> 04:00.196
We believe your husband
was murdered.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.111
Who would murder Neil?

04:02.154 --> 04:03.373
That's crazy.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.017
You and your husband were
going through

04:05.041 --> 04:07.247
a pretty contentious divorce.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.465
Not really.

04:08.509 --> 04:12.208
I mean, we were past
the fighting.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.558
The lawyers were handling it.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.517
I'd say that we were friendly.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.259
Mr. Stern was at
a business dinner last night,

04:19.302 --> 04:20.902
which means his vehicle
was tampered with

04:20.926 --> 04:23.437
between 10:00 p.m.
and 9:00 a.m. this morning.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.614
Do you have an alibi
for that timeframe, Mrs. Stern?

04:27.919 --> 04:29.799
You can't seriously think
that I had something

04:29.823 --> 04:31.085
to do with this.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.926
I was home alone last night,

04:34.970 --> 04:36.972
and this morning I had
an early golf game.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.757
Do you still have access
to the house and the grounds?

04:39.801 --> 04:42.630
Neil changed the locks
and the codes after I left.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.153
He changed the locks on you?

04:44.196 --> 04:45.546
That doesn't sound
very friendly.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.722
He was annoyed,
because occasionally,

04:47.765 --> 04:50.028
I would come in
and move things back

04:50.072 --> 04:52.117
to their rightful positions.

04:52.161 --> 04:55.295
I spent five years decorating
that house.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.391
Did she look like a woman
who could rig a car to explode?

05:04.434 --> 05:08.003
No, but she might hire
someone to do it.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.615
Hey, Cassie.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.748
I'm out of change.
I need fives and tens.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.227
There's a lockbox

05:15.271 --> 05:16.228
under the bar.

05:16.272 --> 05:17.491
The code is 0529.

05:17.534 --> 05:20.842
0529. Got it. Thanks.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.154
You'll be feeling better,
Cottontail,

05:29.198 --> 05:31.461
now that little miss is gone.

05:33.637 --> 05:37.815
People like you who are
sensitive to bad energy...

05:37.859 --> 05:40.601
well, let's just say evil
sometimes

05:40.644 --> 05:42.603
comes dressed
in a pretty package.

05:42.646 --> 05:43.865
Last time I saw you, Ed,

05:43.908 --> 05:45.910
I believe I told you
to get lost.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.956
And I said I'd be back
if you needed me.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.349
I don't need you.

05:49.392 --> 05:53.744
Well, now, we'll see
about that, won't we?

05:53.788 --> 05:57.313
Spend a little more time
with the new girl.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.184
You may change your mind.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.491
- How does this look?
- Yeah, it's great.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.775
- Wherever you want.
- Go there?

06:02.799 --> 06:04.148
Yeah.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.062
Thanks.

06:09.978 --> 06:13.242
Hey, I did a deep dive into
the Sterns' financials.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.504
You find anything?

06:14.548 --> 06:16.068
The usual expenses of
wealthy people:

06:16.092 --> 06:18.247
Designer clothing,
$200 haircuts...

06:18.290 --> 06:21.381
And Lydia bought a men's
Rolex watch two weeks ago.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.947
Paid 20 grand.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.708
Well, that's a month after
she and her husband split,

06:24.732 --> 06:26.252
so I doubt she was
buying him presents.

06:26.276 --> 06:27.648
I talked to her friends.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.520
If she was seeing someone,
they didn't know about it.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.348
Maybe the watch was
a clever way to hide

06:32.392 --> 06:35.046
a $20,000 payment to a hitman.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.396
Keep digging.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.751
Hey, I just hung up with
the Sterns' gardener.

06:43.794 --> 06:46.014
He said he was servicing
another house across the street

06:46.057 --> 06:47.798
this morning
about an hour before the fire.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.234
Did he see something?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.158
He said Lydia Stern pulled up
around 8:00 a.m.

06:51.182 --> 06:52.673
and asked him to open
Neil's gate.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.327
She said she wanted to grab
her golf clubs from the garage,

06:55.371 --> 06:56.546
so he punched her in.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.939
Gardener didn't get a good look,

06:57.982 --> 07:00.420
but he said there was a man
in the car with her.

07:00.463 --> 07:04.554
She said her ex changed
the codes.

07:04.598 --> 07:07.339
Didn't mention that
she circumvented them.

07:07.383 --> 07:10.168
Buckets all the way around.
Let's move it five inches...

07:10.212 --> 07:11.953
It's just like the last one,
Detective.

07:11.996 --> 07:12.823
Fill us in.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.085
We responded to a car fire.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.610
Just found a body inside
the driver's seat.

07:16.653 --> 07:19.351
Owner's name was... Lydia Stern.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.623
I won't tell
the health inspector

08:13.667 --> 08:14.668
if you won't.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.975
Feeling any better?

08:18.019 --> 08:21.152
Cool.

08:24.242 --> 08:26.157
What's the latest on
the Stern fires?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.377
Same MO at both Neil's place
and Lydia's place:

08:28.420 --> 08:29.552
The ignitions were rigged.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.075
Wait, didn't we check her car

08:31.119 --> 08:32.686
after her husband was murdered?

08:32.729 --> 08:34.078
Yep, and it was clean,

08:34.121 --> 08:36.001
which means the tampering
took place after 1:00.

08:36.025 --> 08:38.648
All right, so who would wanna
kill Neil and Lydia Stern?

08:38.692 --> 08:39.693
Life insurance?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.216
Well, I spoke to
their attorneys.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.619
Since they didn't have
any children

08:42.643 --> 08:43.784
or living relatives,

08:43.827 --> 08:45.568
their savings
and life insurance would be

08:45.612 --> 08:47.652
paid out to various charities,
mostly animal rescue.

08:47.676 --> 08:49.441
Interviews with friends
and coworkers

08:49.485 --> 08:51.269
didn't reveal any enemies.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.595
Everyone seemed to like them.
Wait, wait.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.272
What about the man
their gardener saw

08:54.316 --> 08:56.076
in the car with Mrs. Stern
yesterday morning?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.754
His name's Jake Crawford.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.079
He's the golf pro at her club;
Said he and Mrs. Stern went

09:00.122 --> 09:02.122
to pick up her clubs and spent
an hour at the range

09:02.146 --> 09:03.194
working on her swing.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.520
Any chance Jake is
Lydia's new boyfriend?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.241
Well, he denies she gave him
a Rolex,

09:06.284 --> 09:08.460
and he's very happily married
to his husband, Stanley.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.681
Okay, well, what about
the fire investigator's report?

09:11.725 --> 09:13.596
Processing, but we can
get them to rush it.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.946
All right. Keep me posted.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.252
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.775
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.939
I was just hoping I could
talk to you about something.

09:20.963 --> 09:21.778
Is now a bad time?

09:21.822 --> 09:23.693
I'll follow up with
the fire investigator.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.129
Thanks.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.522
What's up?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.246
I think there might be
something going on

09:28.270 --> 09:29.786
with this new girl at work.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.441
What, going on like
she'swhat, in trouble?

09:32.484 --> 09:35.009
More like she is trouble.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.664
Every time I'm around her,
I get this weird feeling

09:37.707 --> 09:40.449
like I'm sick or scared.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.059
And then I looked her up online.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.183
Turns out she was involved
in an accident a year ago.

09:44.207 --> 09:46.107
Some guy attacked her,
and he was killed.

09:46.150 --> 09:49.110
- What's her name?
- Andrea Squire.

09:49.153 --> 09:53.070
Andrea... Squire.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.507
Max Geoghan died in a fall.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
Andrea said it was self-defense.

09:56.944 --> 10:00.077
Protection orders on him
going back five years.

10:00.121 --> 10:03.472
I just can't explain
this weird vibe.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.517
Is there any chance it wasn't
an accident?

10:05.561 --> 10:07.302
What, you think, maybe,
she pushed him?

10:07.345 --> 10:09.130
Five years, it is a long time
to deal with

10:09.173 --> 10:10.522
something like that.

10:10.566 --> 10:13.787
Maybe she just reached
her boiling point.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.430
I can call
the investigating detective,

10:15.454 --> 10:16.920
- if you like.
- Do you mind?

10:16.964 --> 10:18.139
Yeah, sure.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.140
I'll call you when
I know something.

10:19.183 --> 10:20.315
- Thanks.
- All right.

10:20.358 --> 10:21.882
- Before I go...
- Yep?

10:21.925 --> 10:23.492
- Bugs.
- Bugs?

10:23.535 --> 10:26.147
Saw a bunch of bugs.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.976
It might be Andie-related,
or it might be for you.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.339
Thank you. I'll keep an eye out.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.756
Okay.

10:33.545 --> 10:36.548
Tom, got in touch with
the fire investigators.

10:36.592 --> 10:39.421
They ID'd the accelerant used
in both Stern fires.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.685
It has a long scientific name,
but the brand is Chloron.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.992
- An insecticide?
- Yeah, you've heard of it?

10:45.035 --> 10:46.733
No, Cassie just saw bugs.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.692
Yeah, well, Chloron was
banned in 2015.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.826
It's only licensed here to kill
a particular form of insect.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.002
Coincidentally, the same type
of infestation

10:55.045 --> 10:56.046
from the Stern house.

10:56.090 --> 10:57.265
- Fire ants.
- Yeah.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.745
The Sterns' contractor,
Gio Salonga,

10:58.788 --> 11:01.312
he said Stern wanted
him and his guys to

11:01.356 --> 11:02.705
handle the extermination.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.968
If he bought the supplies
before he quit the job...

11:05.012 --> 11:08.668
Then he is carrying
our murder weapon.

11:10.234 --> 11:12.019
It's open.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.501
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.981
Where's Gio Salonga?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.375
He's out at the moment.
Can I help you?

11:20.418 --> 11:21.724
I'm his assistant.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.448
We need to know if
your company purchased

11:23.472 --> 11:25.032
a chemical called Chloron
to combat

11:25.075 --> 11:26.033
the Sterns' bug problem.

11:26.076 --> 11:27.687
We did, yes.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.050
In fact, I've been trying to
return it to the manufacturer.

11:30.074 --> 11:33.518
Mr. Stern fired Gio
before we could even use it.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.390
Was Gio fired or did he quit?

11:35.433 --> 11:37.393
All I know is, he came back
from the Stern house

11:37.417 --> 11:38.741
and said the job was over.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.874
I've been trying to recover
cash that Stern owed us,

11:40.917 --> 11:42.789
as well as money we laid out
for supplies.

11:42.832 --> 11:45.966
- How much cash?
- Almost $10,000.

11:46.009 --> 11:47.794
Where is Gio?
We need to speak with him.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.187
I can call him,
but he probably won't answer.

11:50.231 --> 11:51.711
In half an hour,

11:51.754 --> 11:53.674
he'll be at the skateboard park
on Fourth Avenue.

11:53.718 --> 11:55.838
That's where he and his ex meet
to hand off their son.

11:55.862 --> 11:57.238
That's okay.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.892
Don't call him.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.464
Gio Salonga,
we need to talk with you.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.292
Who are you?

12:09.554 --> 12:12.296
- Seattle PD.
- What's this about?

12:12.340 --> 12:13.780
I already told you
everything I know.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.778
Wait, are you in
some kind of trouble?

12:15.822 --> 12:18.781
No, Vera.
Neil Stern died this morning.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.391
He was murdered.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.698
And now his wife,
Lydia, is dead too.

12:24.482 --> 12:25.788
I hadn't heard.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.552
This doesn't have anything
to do with him.

12:27.596 --> 12:28.945
He just worked for them.

12:28.988 --> 12:31.402
It's okay.
I'lll'll straighten it out.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.187
Can you keep Gabe until tonight?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.405
Of course.

12:34.449 --> 12:36.277
But I wanna go with you, Dad.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.670
Could I get a second?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.152
Hey, I just need to go talk
to the police officers.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.328
Pick you up in a few hours?

12:45.242 --> 12:46.504
- Call me later.
- Yeah.

12:46.548 --> 12:47.897
It's all right.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.596
If you're looking for someone
who had a grudge

12:51.640 --> 12:53.294
against the Sterns,
I'm not your guy.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.686
I told you, I liked them.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.819
That extermination job
Neil wanted you to do,

12:56.863 --> 12:58.263
you'd already booked
the supplies...

12:58.287 --> 12:59.648
A chemical called Chloron.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.476
- Yeah, what about it?
- Where is it now?

13:01.519 --> 13:02.607
Back of the truck.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.836
It was here, I swear.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.144
Let's go.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.498
Where did you get
the Chloron, Gio?

13:23.541 --> 13:25.065
I know a guy who's
an exterminator.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.457
He sold me a jug.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.764
It's allowed if
you're killing fire ants.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.768
If you have a license,
which you don't.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.162
Come on, seriously.
It's bug spray.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.773
Tell us the real reason
Neil Stern fired you, Gio.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.863
Is it because you were
sleeping with his wife?

13:40.907 --> 13:44.954
Lydia Stern bought an expensive
men's watch two weeks ago.

13:44.998 --> 13:45.998
That was for you, right?

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
I know I shouldn't have
lied to you.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.051
It's just

13:55.095 --> 13:56.487
I'm about to sue my ex-wife

13:56.531 --> 13:57.880
for full-custody of our son,

13:57.924 --> 14:00.535
and I can't get wrapped up
in any of this.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.711
Vera's lawyer would
slaughter me on the stand.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.452
How long has the affair
been going on?

14:04.495 --> 14:05.888
A few weeks.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.890
I don't know why Lydia got me
the watch.

14:07.934 --> 14:08.760
I didn't want it.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.197
She said that I could sell it

14:10.240 --> 14:12.939
and that it would cover
the money that Neil owed me.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.901
That truck you're driving,
'56 Chevy...

14:18.945 --> 14:21.251
- Yeah, yeah.
- You do the work yourself?

14:21.295 --> 14:22.731
Me and my son.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.448
They're kind of a project,
something to do together.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.072
You'd have to be
a pretty good mechanic

14:26.096 --> 14:27.605
to do that kind of work, right?

14:27.649 --> 14:29.569
You know your way around
a car's ignition system.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.174
You know that
the fuel air mixture

14:31.218 --> 14:33.258
in the engine's combustion
chambers could be used to

14:33.282 --> 14:34.656
ignite an accelerant.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.379
Yeah, here's what
we think happened, Gio.

14:36.403 --> 14:37.224
We think

14:37.267 --> 14:38.660
Lydia gave you that watch

14:38.703 --> 14:42.185
as payment...
to kill her husband.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.186
And you murdered Lydia

14:43.230 --> 14:44.622
to tie up the loose ends.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.581
No, no, no. You're wrong.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.236
I swear, I didn't do it!

15:00.900 --> 15:02.814
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, kid.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.295
Just wanted to let you know,
I spoke to that detective.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.123
He said he's certain that
Max Geoghan's death

15:07.167 --> 15:08.951
was self-defense.

15:08.995 --> 15:12.476
Apparently, he was arrested for
trespassing in Andie's yard,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.130
spent a few nights in jail;

15:14.174 --> 15:16.176
When he got out, furious,
took off after her and,

15:16.219 --> 15:18.004
well, she fought back.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.657
Okay.
Thanks for letting me know.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.963
I'll talk to you later.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.662
Another headache?

15:24.706 --> 15:26.012
Hang on.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.971
I've got some aspirin.

15:29.015 --> 15:33.889
I've got my whole life in here,
but...

15:33.933 --> 15:36.239
I can never find anything.

15:36.283 --> 15:39.155
A Taser. I got one of those.

15:39.199 --> 15:41.114
I always forget to charge it.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.767
My dad gave it to me.
He's a cop.

15:46.162 --> 15:49.165
I take this with me everywhere.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.994
- It saved my life.
- Really?

15:52.038 --> 15:54.866
Yeah, I had a stalker.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.739
That's terrible.

15:57.782 --> 16:00.307
He was a customer at
the bakery where I worked.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.918
We'd say hello,
chat a little bit,

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
but that was it.

16:04.441 --> 16:07.705
Then one day,
he leaves a note on my car.

16:07.749 --> 16:10.970
He's decided we're in love
and meant to be together.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.972
Aw, man.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.410
The next thing I know,
he's everywhere.

16:16.453 --> 16:19.456
I'd see him on street corners,
watching me.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.632
If I went out with friends,
he'd show up.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.809
I quit my job,
changed my phone number.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.507
My house was a fortress.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.596
I had a security system
installed,

16:28.639 --> 16:32.730
and we caught him on tape
in my backyard.

16:32.774 --> 16:36.125
It was enough to arrest him
for trespassing.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.735
He spent a week in jail...

16:37.779 --> 16:42.044
The first week in five years
I got a good night's sleep.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.742
But then his parents bailed
him out.

16:44.786 --> 16:46.092
No one told me.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.789
So you thought he was
still inside?

16:47.832 --> 16:50.052
Yeah, I thought I was safe.

16:50.096 --> 16:53.273
So I decided to do something
really crazy.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.624
I went on a hike by myself.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.105
I was almost to the top of
the ridge

16:59.148 --> 17:01.933
when I realized
he'd followed me.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.413
He had a rope in his hands.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.589
He said he was done
playing games.

17:06.634 --> 17:11.117
He was so mad, out of control,
I thought he was gonna kill me.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.250
I managed to tase him,
and he let me go.

17:14.294 --> 17:18.428
We struggled, and I don't know,
I pushed him off me.

17:18.472 --> 17:21.518
He slipped, fell over the side.

17:23.346 --> 17:27.307
The cops said
he must have died instantly.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.311
Can you see me?

17:32.138 --> 17:33.618
Sounds like a horrible thing
to say,

17:33.642 --> 17:35.750
because someone lost their life,

17:35.793 --> 17:39.667
but at least he was
finally gone, you know?

17:42.626 --> 17:45.151
Are you okay?

17:45.194 --> 17:46.761
Migraine.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.201
- We're a pair?
- Yeah.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.861
Ironic, isn't it?

17:59.904 --> 18:02.298
She thinks I'm gone...

18:04.692 --> 18:07.129
But really,
we're closer than ever.

18:14.876 --> 18:18.053
If Gio Salonga has motive,
means, and opportunity,

18:18.097 --> 18:19.402
why isn't he under arrest?

18:19.446 --> 18:21.143
That's because we finally got
in touch

18:21.187 --> 18:23.102
with Gio's alibi, Dylan McGee.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.843
He confirms they were camping
the night before last

18:25.887 --> 18:27.280
up at Dash Point.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.163
They didn't get back into town
until 10:00 a.m.

18:29.187 --> 18:30.935
Neil Stern's car went up
at 9:00 a.m.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.329
And when Lydia's burned,
Gio was at a jobsite.

18:33.373 --> 18:34.813
We don't have enough
to charge him.

18:34.856 --> 18:36.256
Well, we need to find
the Chloron.

18:36.292 --> 18:38.943
Forensics searched
his house, his office...

18:38.987 --> 18:40.336
It's not there.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.599
Maybe a night in jail will
shake him up a little.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.514
Tomorrow, I'll put a tail
on him and see if

18:44.558 --> 18:46.342
he leads us to
the murder weapon.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.214
- Will do.
- All right.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.137
Dr. Ronson, what are you doing
here so late?

18:58.180 --> 18:59.660
Is everything okay?

18:59.703 --> 19:01.705
I just stopped by to see
Sally on my way home.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.968
We've noticed a change
in her brain activity

19:04.012 --> 19:05.535
over the last few days.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.407
Her brain waves will spike

19:07.450 --> 19:09.060
then drop precipitously

19:09.104 --> 19:10.061
then rise again.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.541
What does that mean?

19:11.585 --> 19:14.892
To be honest, I'm not sure.

19:14.936 --> 19:19.245
Could it be that
she's trying to wake up?

19:19.288 --> 19:20.898
That's a possibility.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.379
There's nothing to do
but wait and see.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.408
Another one coming on?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.628
Andie gets those too.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.589
Too much bad energy
floating around.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.505
If you mean me, don't worry.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.812
When Andie goes,
I'll go with her.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.335
She's planning a trip
with her parents

20:06.359 --> 20:07.597
to California.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.947
She wants to see the redwoods.

20:09.991 --> 20:12.733
That'll be nice for us.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.388
Relaxing.
You should leave her alone.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.867
She does not want you with her.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.609
I know she says that,
but she doesn't mean it.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.786
Andie's always fought
her feelings for me.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.441
When I was alive,
she filed restraining orders.

20:25.485 --> 20:29.184
Now she casts spells.
It's a game she plays.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.533
What are you talking about?

20:30.577 --> 20:32.143
Every week there's a new one;

20:32.187 --> 20:33.319
A cleansing spell,

20:33.362 --> 20:34.581
a protection spell,

20:34.624 --> 20:36.452
a banishing spell...

20:38.846 --> 20:41.979
I think she knows
I'm still with her.

20:42.023 --> 20:44.373
She just can't admit
her feelings for me.

20:44.417 --> 20:47.637
Yes, she can. She hates you.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.642
Come on.

20:52.686 --> 20:55.645
All I've ever wanted is
to make Andie happy.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.518
I'm like one of those characters

20:58.561 --> 21:01.999
in a romance book
girls love to read.

21:02.043 --> 21:05.612
Everyone wants that, don't they?

21:05.655 --> 21:08.310
Love that transcends death.

21:16.449 --> 21:18.668
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.976
So, you're saying this woman
is still being stalked?

21:22.019 --> 21:23.238
- Yeah.
- Wow.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.240
It's like nothing's changed,
really.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.329
Creepers gonna creep,
even in death.

21:27.373 --> 21:30.071
The thing is, even if
she tells herself he's gone,

21:30.114 --> 21:32.247
I think deep down she knows
he's not.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.611
Those headaches
I've been getting,

21:33.640 --> 21:36.077
Andie gets them too every time
that he's around.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.558
And Max, he said that
she's been doing

21:38.601 --> 21:39.907
these cleansing spells.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.343
She's trying to get rid of him.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
She just doesn't know
how to do it.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.912
Right, 'cause you can't get
a restraining order

21:44.955 --> 21:46.479
on a spirit.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.002
Is there any way
to get him to leave

21:48.045 --> 21:50.134
with her never having to know?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.354
I mean, dead people
are still just people, right?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.921
Everyone wants something.

21:53.964 --> 21:57.011
Unfortunately, I think Max
just wants Andie.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.447
But I need a plan...

21:58.491 --> 22:00.057
Like a foolproof way
to make sure

22:00.101 --> 22:02.712
he is gone
and he's not coming back.

22:02.756 --> 22:08.109
Well, if it were me
and Max was still alive,

22:08.152 --> 22:10.416
I'd just send my brother
to pay him a visit.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.811
Call you later.

22:14.855 --> 22:17.118
Bye.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.261
I don't get it.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.700
How could I see Sally's spirit
if she's still alive?

22:33.743 --> 22:37.007
My Irish grandmother
would say you saw a fetch.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.879
- A what?
- A fetch.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.446
It's kind of a premonition.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.883
Is it a premonition of death?

22:42.926 --> 22:44.450
Not always.

22:44.493 --> 22:47.975
Some think it's actually
the sign of a long, happy life.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.020
But look, since we don't know
what it means,

22:50.064 --> 22:51.457
don't tell him.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.372
Okay, thanks.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.165
Cassie called earlier.
She asked after Sally.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.645
Any news?

23:05.688 --> 23:07.037
Not really.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.039
There's been some change
in her brain activity.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.781
The doctor still isn't sure
what it means.

23:13.217 --> 23:16.830
The not knowing,
that's the hardest part.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.222
Yeah.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.466
Well, tell Cassie I appreciate

23:19.490 --> 23:20.703
her concern though, will you?

23:20.747 --> 23:22.009
There's Gio.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.800
From jail to work.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.236
No rest for the wicked.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.385
Gio, stay down.

24:00.743 --> 24:03.877
We need fire and an ambulance.
113 Longsight Road.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.227
Rush the bus.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.317
Yep. Yeah, that's good to know.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.580
Yeah. Thanks.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.236
Yeah, we will. Okay, bye.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.890
Hey, that was Seattle General.

24:16.933 --> 24:20.067
Gio has third-degree burns
on more than 50% of his body,

24:20.110 --> 24:22.591
but they think
he'll pull through.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.155
The doctor said it'll be
a while before

24:24.179 --> 24:25.246
we can talk to him.

24:25.289 --> 24:28.554
- Look at this.
- Trip wire.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.338
It's not nearly
as complicated a system

24:30.381 --> 24:33.254
as the rigging in the cars,
but it did the job.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.995
Yeah.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.127
And you see this.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.520
My guess is, when we test that,

24:38.564 --> 24:41.480
we'll find that's
our missing bottle of Chloron.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.091
Gio did lead us to
the murder weapon.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.534
Yeah, but who has a motive
to want

24:45.571 --> 24:47.224
all three of these people dead?

24:47.268 --> 24:48.668
Maybe someone who
didn't like that.

24:48.692 --> 24:51.999
Gio Salonga and Lydia Stern
were having an affair.

24:52.839 --> 24:56.146
When you told us Gio was fired
off the Stern job, Leon,

24:56.190 --> 24:58.235
you neglected to tell us
the reason why.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.761
Gio was having an affair with
Lydia Stern.

25:01.804 --> 25:05.025
I didn't know for sure,
but yeah,

25:05.068 --> 25:07.462
they spent a lot of time
together.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.595
Who else knew what was going on?

25:09.638 --> 25:11.771
Gio was trying to keep it quiet,

25:11.814 --> 25:15.339
but he said that Vera,
his ex-wife, caught them once

25:15.383 --> 25:17.777
when Lydia was driving him home.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.169
She hit the roof.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.389
The Salongas have been
divorced for years.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.957
Mrs. Salonga never got over Gio.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.440
She wanted them to get
back together.

25:25.464 --> 25:27.482
Gio even gave it some thought,

25:27.526 --> 25:30.398
mostly for their son's sake,
you know.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.356
But in the end, he told her no.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.796
She was pissed, started to mess
with Gio's visitation.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.493
She was fed up.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.147
He wanted to sue for
full custody.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.583
Did he think she was unfit?

25:41.627 --> 25:43.627
Gio thought the kid would be
better off with him.

25:43.651 --> 25:44.455
That's all.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.892
Did Vera know about his plans?

25:45.935 --> 25:47.197
No.

25:47.241 --> 25:48.372
Gio wasn't gonna tell her

25:48.416 --> 25:50.810
until the papers were filed.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.333
Who needs more drama?

25:55.554 --> 25:59.079
Well, well, look who's back.

25:59.122 --> 26:00.994
Little ole me.

26:03.083 --> 26:05.738
Seems like every day since
you kicked me out of here,

26:05.781 --> 26:09.829
I come a knock-knock-knockin',
but I never get no answer.

26:09.872 --> 26:13.615
Imagine my delight when
I stop by for a visit

26:13.659 --> 26:17.358
and find your door wide open.

26:17.401 --> 26:21.231
Don't get too excited.
It's only temporary.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.887
I need your help.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.586
Do tell.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.731
The reason I've been getting
those headaches,

26:30.755 --> 26:32.025
it's not Andie.

26:32.068 --> 26:35.811
It's this creep who's
following her around.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
I know all about it.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.642
Max and me,
we've gotten real close.

26:41.774 --> 26:44.254
Well, I guess that
shouldn't surprise me.

26:44.298 --> 26:47.649
I was a bit of a Peeping Tom
in my day.

26:47.693 --> 26:51.740
But that boy, he takes it
to a whole new level.

26:51.784 --> 26:53.481
He's crazy.

26:54.830 --> 26:58.442
Well, seeing as you guys are
such good pals,

26:58.486 --> 27:00.706
how do I get him to leave?

27:00.749 --> 27:04.753
Best to let the dead deal
with their own.

27:09.279 --> 27:13.153
Ed, you said you wanted
to help me.

27:13.196 --> 27:15.372
Here's your chance.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.374
Tell me what to do.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.816
There might be one thing
that will work...

27:23.859 --> 27:27.515
Little trick I picked up
over here.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.909
But I can't do it by myself.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.867
I need your help.

27:36.219 --> 27:39.048
You ready to walk on
the wild side?

27:49.058 --> 27:50.458
Thanks for coming over
so quickly.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.018
Sure.

27:52.061 --> 27:54.221
I still don't get why we can't
talk at the bar, though.

27:54.245 --> 27:56.856
Right, that.

27:58.851 --> 28:02.158
You know how you said
your house was a fortress?

28:03.551 --> 28:08.121
So is mine, but the locks
are a little different.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.863
I'm not keeping people out.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.084
I'm keeping out ghosts.

28:15.911 --> 28:17.783
Ghosts?

28:17.826 --> 28:21.221
I see them. I hear them.

28:21.264 --> 28:22.744
Sometimes they send me
a message,

28:22.788 --> 28:24.920
and sometimes they just show up.

28:24.964 --> 28:29.446
But if I don't want them
in my house, I can block them.

28:29.490 --> 28:32.885
And I'm blocking one
in particular right now,

28:32.928 --> 28:35.191
because I need this
conversation to be private.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.021
Okay.

28:40.631 --> 28:44.113
- You think I sound crazy.
- A little.

28:44.157 --> 28:45.636
Just try and keep an open mind.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.773
Are you planning a trip
to California

28:51.817 --> 28:54.428
to see the redwoods?

28:54.471 --> 28:59.172
My mom called and suggested
it last night, and...

29:00.826 --> 29:03.089
Howhow did you know?

29:04.699 --> 29:06.570
Max Geoghan told me.

29:09.008 --> 29:12.968
No, no, no! Max Geoghan is dead!

29:13.012 --> 29:14.491
Yeah, he is.

29:14.535 --> 29:19.279
But he's... he's still here.

29:20.193 --> 29:23.500
Most people would say that
he's haunting you,

29:23.544 --> 29:27.722
but I think we can call it
what it really is, Andie.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.377
You are still being stalked.

29:31.682 --> 29:34.163
Why should I believe you?

29:34.207 --> 29:35.599
Because I think you already know

29:35.643 --> 29:38.472
what I'm saying is true.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.300
You know he is still here.

29:42.041 --> 29:46.175
He says you do these cleansing
and protection spells

29:46.219 --> 29:48.830
every week to try
and get rid of him.

29:56.925 --> 30:00.537
I thought I was just...

30:00.581 --> 30:04.846
paranoid or losing my mind,
but I...

30:04.890 --> 30:08.328
I do still feel him
watching him.

30:08.371 --> 30:09.677
Yeah.

30:10.939 --> 30:12.201
What do I do?

30:12.245 --> 30:14.203
How do I get rid of him
for good?

30:14.247 --> 30:17.337
I think I can help you.

30:17.380 --> 30:20.688
But you have to do exactly what
I tell you.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.945
That's enough of that.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.967
Mrs. Salonga.
We met the other day.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.410
Don't you have
better things to do

31:23.434 --> 31:25.448
than harass a grieving family?

31:25.492 --> 31:27.886
Go find the man who tried
to kill my husband.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.539
That's exactly why we're here.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.151
We need you to come with us,
answer some questions.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.414
- I can't leave my son.
- We'll bring him with us.

31:34.457 --> 31:37.069
A social worker can watch him
while we talk.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.770
Gabe.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.119
I'll get him.

31:44.163 --> 31:46.730
Mrs. Salonga, I'll get him.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.169
I don't understand what
this is about.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.606
We'll explain everything
at the precinct.

31:52.649 --> 31:56.218
Gabe, it's Detective Asante.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.177
We met the other day, remember?

32:01.310 --> 32:02.964
That bobblehead, is that yours?

32:03.008 --> 32:04.400
It's Gabe's.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.402
Asante!

32:10.711 --> 32:12.756
Leave my mother alone!

32:15.803 --> 32:17.326
Gabe! Gabe!

32:17.370 --> 32:19.502
Off! Get off!

32:19.546 --> 32:21.983
Gabe!

32:27.423 --> 32:30.861
- Glad you could make it.
- I know, right?

32:30.905 --> 32:32.646
You and I need to talk.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.866
I got nothing to say to you.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.172
Andie went to your house.

32:37.216 --> 32:38.739
She was there for an hour,

32:38.782 --> 32:40.175
but I couldn't get inside.

32:40.219 --> 32:43.178
My own version of
a restraining order.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.963
Then she went to
her storage unit,

32:45.006 --> 32:46.703
took out a bunch of boxes...

32:46.747 --> 32:48.836
The ones with all
the paperwork from the court

32:48.879 --> 32:51.970
and the notes and the gifts
that I sent her.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.060
Then she brought them
back to you.

32:55.103 --> 32:57.192
Why would you tell her
to do that?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.020
It's none of your business.

32:59.064 --> 33:03.372
Everything about Andie
is my business.

33:04.199 --> 33:06.593
Get out of my way.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.338
And what if I don't?

33:19.780 --> 33:22.043
You better take something
for that headache.

33:30.965 --> 33:34.273
Gabe, do you understand this
is a custodial interrogation?

33:34.316 --> 33:36.840
Attorney Lee is here
to protect your rights.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.494
And anytime you wanna
stop talking,

33:38.538 --> 33:40.844
you just let me know, okay?

33:40.888 --> 33:42.281
Okay.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.503
Gabe, were you mad at your dad?

33:47.547 --> 33:50.680
No. I like my dad all right.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.595
My mom was mad, though.

33:52.639 --> 33:55.990
She's mad at everybody
all the time.

33:56.034 --> 33:59.776
What happens when
your mom gets mad?

33:59.820 --> 34:01.778
She yells and cries.

34:01.822 --> 34:03.519
She says mean things.

34:03.563 --> 34:06.044
What kind of things?

34:06.087 --> 34:08.089
She says I'm worthless
and I don't love her.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.873
I say I do,
but she doesn't believe me.

34:10.918 --> 34:15.009
Sometimes she says
she's going to "end it all."

34:15.053 --> 34:17.533
She asks me for help,
and I say yes,

34:17.577 --> 34:20.014
just so she'll shut up.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.322
Then she forgets about it
for a while.

34:24.366 --> 34:27.108
This time, she didn't forget.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.241
What did your mom
want you to do?

34:29.284 --> 34:31.330
Hurt the people who were
making her unhappy.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.288
Like Mrs. Stern?

34:34.594 --> 34:37.118
Mom said Dad wanted to
come home.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.728
Mrs. Stern ruined it.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.819
And what about Mr. Stern?

34:42.862 --> 34:46.170
Yeah. That was a mistake.

34:47.259 --> 34:49.565
When Mom helped me climb over
the gate,

34:49.609 --> 34:51.219
she didn't tell me which car.

34:51.263 --> 34:54.353
You thought you rigged
Mrs. Stern's car?

34:56.137 --> 34:57.965
How did you even know how
to do that, Gabe?

34:58.008 --> 35:00.272
My dad taught me about cars.

35:00.315 --> 35:03.492
We fix them up, all kinds.

35:03.536 --> 35:06.495
Mom kept saying when
Mrs. Stern was gone,

35:06.539 --> 35:09.150
Dad would come home
and she'd be happy.

35:09.194 --> 35:11.152
I should have known that
was a lie.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.372
She's never happy.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.635
And Dad was never coming home.

35:16.592 --> 35:18.768
Gabe...

35:18.812 --> 35:21.119
did you rig your dad's office?

35:22.076 --> 35:25.340
That was Mom. I like Dad.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.255
But I told her how.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.790
This is where it happened.

35:40.834 --> 35:44.142
He grabbed me right over here...

35:45.839 --> 35:48.233
And that's where he fell.

35:50.365 --> 35:51.932
Let's set up.

35:57.851 --> 36:00.984
Write his name on
the back of this.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.727
Go and find a quiet spot
and just think about Max.

36:04.771 --> 36:06.947
Think about everything
he did to you.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.428
That'll help drive the spell.

36:17.697 --> 36:19.873
A banishing spell?

36:19.916 --> 36:21.875
Is that all you've got?

36:21.918 --> 36:25.357
They don't work.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.489
I know.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.318
I just needed
to get you up here.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.928
Apparently, it's easier

36:31.972 --> 36:34.322
if you're in the spot
where you died.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.369
Easier for what?

36:37.412 --> 36:39.197
For him.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.809
Hey, buddy.

36:42.852 --> 36:47.248
Hey, man, nothing personal.
You understand.

37:03.221 --> 37:07.268
Cassie, I think it worked.
I think he's gone.

37:09.836 --> 37:12.360
I feel lighter...

37:12.404 --> 37:16.103
like a weight is off my chest
and I can breathe.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.541
Finally, I can breathe.

37:19.585 --> 37:23.241
He is gone for good this time.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.894
Thank you.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.356
Like I said before,

37:51.399 --> 37:55.142
best let the dead deal
with their own.

37:55.969 --> 37:58.276
You're welcome, Cottontail.

38:04.934 --> 38:07.067
Do you wanna grab a bite
before I drop you off?

38:08.677 --> 38:10.200
I'd like that.

38:28.828 --> 38:31.744
Vera Salonga has been booked.
So far, she's not talking.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.354
And the DA said with
Gabe's testimony,

38:33.398 --> 38:34.964
they should be able to
convict her

38:35.008 --> 38:37.315
in attempted murder on
the attack of her husband

38:37.358 --> 38:39.317
and conspiracy in
the Stern murders.

38:39.360 --> 38:40.880
They're still debating
whether or not

38:40.904 --> 38:42.407
to try Gabe as an adult.

38:42.450 --> 38:45.279
What kind of mother convinces
her son to commit murder?

38:45.323 --> 38:46.976
It's called maternal narcissism.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.152
In Mrs. Salonga's case,
it manifest itself

38:49.196 --> 38:52.025
as extreme emotional neediness.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.636
The kid was desperate
to make his mother happy.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.899
She made it clear the only way
for him to do that

38:56.943 --> 38:58.292
was to kill for her.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.989
Can he be rehabilitated?

39:00.033 --> 39:04.167
Once the break with
his mother is complete, maybe.

39:05.038 --> 39:07.649
Gio says he loves his son...

39:07.693 --> 39:08.824
Gonna stand by him.

39:11.871 --> 39:14.395
It's Sally's doctor. Excuse me.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.442
Yeah?

39:22.664 --> 39:26.059
Damien, I'm taking
your Harvard sweater with me.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.497
- Don't say no.
- What?

39:29.541 --> 39:30.716
I didn't hear you.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.848
I said, I'm taking your...

39:41.640 --> 39:43.337
What?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.078
I'm taking your college sweater.

39:45.121 --> 39:46.688
Yeah, I know where it is.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.386
- I'll get it for you.
- Got it.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.173
I'm flying up to Seattle
next week to see you.

39:53.216 --> 39:56.176
I like the sound of that.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.182
Hey. Excuse me.

40:06.578 --> 40:10.059
Dr. Sarno to Oncology Research.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.671
Dr. Sarno to Oncology Research.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.028
Hey.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.470
I hope it's okay I came over.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.429
Tom told me.

40:33.256 --> 40:35.650
Yeah, I wasl was with her
when...

40:37.913 --> 40:40.133
She's gone.

40:40.176 --> 40:42.178
I'm so sorry.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.487
I thought I was prepared,
but I wasn't.

40:49.316 --> 40:53.799
I guess I was still hoping,
you know, that...

40:53.842 --> 40:57.106
that she'd come out of it,
that she'd be all right.

41:02.155 --> 41:04.157
I saw her.

41:05.550 --> 41:09.597
She was packing clothes
for Seattle...

41:09.641 --> 41:12.774
your college sweater.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.738
It was in the drawer
where I'd hidden the ring.

41:14.762 --> 41:19.811
I... I was so afraid
that she'd find it.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.010
She did find it.

41:32.359 --> 41:36.494
But she pretended she hadn't,
so you could surprise her.

41:49.245 --> 41:51.378
Thank you for telling me.

41:55.600 --> 41:58.211
I can stay a while, if you want.

42:01.649 --> 42:02.824
Yeah.
