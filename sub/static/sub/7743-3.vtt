00:08.967 --> 00:10.426
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.511 --> 00:12.970
-Jackie around today?
-Try the nurses' station.

00:13.055 --> 00:16.516
You stole $1 2,000 worth of Roxies off me.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.185
-l have no idea what you're talking about.
-You don't want to fuck with me.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.854
-Vermin!
-God's off his meds again.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.439
You are an angel.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.317
There's one boy.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.030
Columbia Pres., l know everybody in HR.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.741
St. Luke's,
l trained more than half their staff.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.493
So there is pretty much no place you can go

00:35.577 --> 00:38.371
where l can't be in 24 hours. Please stay.

00:38.831 --> 00:42.166
-Kev showing up at work?
-l don't know what you want me to do.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.335
l want him to know that l work at All Saints.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.130
Call him and tell him you just
lost yourjob and you're looking for work

00:47.214 --> 00:48.548
in a downtown pharmacy.

00:48.841 --> 00:52.343
-Eddie lost his job today.
-Wow. l'm sorry to hear that.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.388
Thought maybe you'd put in a word
at All Saints.

00:56.473 --> 01:00.101
-Yeah, sure. l'll see what l can do.
-Yeah, see what you can do.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.105
You are stuck with me.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.016
You're up early. Wow, waffles?

02:24.770 --> 02:26.687
l made you a couple of sandwiches
from the chicken last night.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.022
They're in the fridge if you want them.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.024
Nice.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.943
You're drinking tea?

02:32.444 --> 02:35.238
Yeah, taking a break from coffee.
Makes me buzzy.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.491
Good. That's good.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.204
Keep an eye on the bacon.
l'm gonna go wake up the girls.

02:55.050 --> 02:57.093
Aunt Tunie and the pilot broke up.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.722
So he breaks up with me
while l'm still at work.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.642
-What a fucking butt knuckle.
-Tunie.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.562
"Fricking." Sorry, Kevin,
but it's an emotional story.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.273
-What's a butt knuckle?
-l couldn't tell you, honey.

03:10.983 --> 03:12.149
lt's a pilot, Fi.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.943
l will kill you if you ever date a pilot.

03:14.069 --> 03:15.444
Are you gonna start crying again?

03:15.779 --> 03:18.990
So he breaks up with me
via text fricking message at work.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.075
And then he puts
this bullshit sad face at the end

03:21.159 --> 03:23.369
like that's somehow gonna muffle
the fricking blow, right?

03:23.453 --> 03:26.873
So l take advantage of the British Air
employee discount on drinks,

03:26.957 --> 03:31.335
but as everyone knows, the pussy British
executive lounge closes at 1 0:00.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.589
-And you didn't want to be alone.
-Exactly.

03:34.673 --> 03:38.426
So l downed four more Black Russians,

03:38.510 --> 03:39.719
like, two or six Heineken, whatever.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.637
And the next thing you know,
l'm at your door.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.516
-What time did you get in?
-lt was after 3:00.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.977
l just used my key
and crashed with the girls.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.855
-She's done it before.
-Yes, but in all fairness,

03:50.939 --> 03:52.648
l'm usually gone
before you guys even get up.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.277
l'm never scared.
l just pretend she's the tooth fairy.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.863
Well, Aunt Tunie was shitfaced.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.534
-You sure you don't want a plate?
-l'm good.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.246
Okay, girls, show's over. Time for school.
Let's go.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.916
Hold on, hold on.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.169
-Aunt Tunie gave it to me.
-Yeah.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.922
Shit.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.592
l'm sorry, Gracie.
This is all l've got left of him.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.219
But l'll buy you
some fancy shampoo later, okay?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.472
All right.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.435
l forgot to tell you,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.979
l put in a good word for Eddie at work.
l think he's got a shot.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.399
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah. lt was no big deal.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.777
Thanks.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.790
Kevin told me everything.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.711
-Are you okay?
-Yes. What did he tell you?

04:56.129 --> 04:59.674
He told me that he and that snotty doctor
you work with did an intervention on you.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.510
And l told him,
"Kevin, interventions are just fucking rude."

05:03.011 --> 05:05.429
-Yeah, we're good, Tunie.
-No, of course you are.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.306
l mean, Kevin can be so overly dramatic,

05:07.391 --> 05:09.934
you know, because of
our mother's drinking and that red wig.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.186
But what l'm saying is
if you ever need me to,

05:12.270 --> 05:15.690
you know, calm him down about stuff,

05:15.774 --> 05:17.358
l'm so here and there for you.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.360
Thank you.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.281
-On that note, l need a favor.
-Okay.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.575
l was gonna move in with the...

05:26.660 --> 05:27.952
Gave up my lease and everything.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.163
Can l crash here for a few days, you know,
just till l figure my shit out?

05:31.248 --> 05:32.707
Sure.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.002
-Thank you.
-Okay.

05:36.795 --> 05:39.296
-Do you want another waffle?
-Yes, please.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.548
Okay.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.594
l didn't know Kevin had a baby sister.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.930
Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna stay
with us a couple days,

05:48.015 --> 05:49.473
which is good, l guess.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.267
Yeah, good for you.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.769
Company can, you know,
help take some of the pressure off.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.230
-Yeah, that's true.
-Sure.

05:57.399 --> 06:01.652
-Look, you know what? This is fucked up.
-What?

06:03.280 --> 06:06.157
l can't stand
when you take me off the shelf like this.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.993
lt's bullshit.

06:09.578 --> 06:13.622
You throw me this crumb and l'm hooked.
lt's fucking pathetic.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.420
l'm sorry, Eddie.
l don't know how to do this.

06:22.049 --> 06:25.134
lf you need for us not to be friends, l get it.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.515
You might want to call your buddy Kevin,
tell him you got the job.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.017
He's crazy about you, you know?

06:34.770 --> 06:37.563
-This is weird.
-So fucking weird.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.060
We've got a young mother of two,

07:16.144 --> 07:19.563
fell six feet into
an open sidewalk cellar door.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.400
Massive internal bleeding. They need to
get her into surgery to determine the source.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.027
-What's her name?
-Geela.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.614
She and her husband David
are very orthodox.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.243
Her parents are reformed, very suburban.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.454
Dr. O'Hara is confabbing with them now.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.457
-She needs to get to surgery.
-What's the holdup?

07:38.542 --> 07:40.543
Her orthodox husband would prefer

07:40.627 --> 07:43.003
that she be moved
to their doctor at Beth lsrael.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.923
Her parents want her
operated on immediately.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.968
Take the parents to the family room.
Keep the husband in here.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.262
Call lCU and have them ready for her.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
Let's go.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.348
Don't touch my stuff.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.275
Turf wars.
These two were fighting over a corner.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.776
Who hasn't?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.069
The vendor over here burned this guy,

08:07.154 --> 08:09.446
who then retaliated
with a shish-kebab skewer.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.490
Bon appÃ©tit!

08:12.826 --> 08:17.037
Right, l have a hot oil burn
and a facial puncture wound.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.874
l am feeling generous today, Dr. Cooper.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.959
l'll go with the burn.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.004
Holy moly.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.676
What did he say?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.012
-He said, "Dogs should shit on you."
-Lovely.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.682
Sam, will you hold the kebab still
while l have a look?

08:41.229 --> 08:44.064
-So, Thor...
-Hilarious.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.691
What?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.735
That's the first time in two years
you've gotten my name right.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.819
Not true.

08:48.904 --> 08:53.908
You call me sport, chief,
wegian and Grande D,

08:53.992 --> 08:56.076
which l assume stands for big diabetic.

08:56.411 --> 08:59.163
Busted. New chapter, my friend.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.749
l hear you're really good at fantasy football.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.627
-Yeah, l am outstanding.
-l need your help.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.504
Careful, Thor.
He might sleep with your boyfriend.

09:14.596 --> 09:17.181
-Hi, l'm Jackie.
-Why is everyone wasting time?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.350
-l'm sorry, what's your name?
-David.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.727
This is very simple.
l need to get her out of here.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.147
Okay, we're just trying to understand
why you don't want her treated here.

09:25.232 --> 09:28.317
Her doctor is at Beth lsrael.
Why didn't they take her there?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.194
The EMTs just brought her
to the nearest hospital.

09:30.278 --> 09:31.779
She wants to go to Beth lsrael.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.531
The problem is when a patient
has internal bleeding,

09:34.616 --> 09:37.284
it can be very dangerous to transport them.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.372
l'm trying to speak for my wife.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.084
Are you sure you want to do this?

09:45.543 --> 09:49.838
We made vows. We have beliefs.
They either mean everything or nothing.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.887
-l don't understand, Father.
-lt's a snafu.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.973
-A snafu?
-Yes.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.850
When All Saints built a new addition in 1 978,

10:01.935 --> 10:05.396
the hospital and its property
were rezoned for commercial purposes.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.941
As such, the chapel
was officially deconsecrated,

10:09.025 --> 10:11.986
which means
that any statuary, relics, et cetera,

10:12.070 --> 10:14.405
should have been removed
from the space in 1 978.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.073
You want to deconsecrate my chapel?

10:16.157 --> 10:18.409
According to the books,
the move date was scheduled,

10:18.493 --> 10:21.495
canceled and rescheduled
half a dozen times.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.623
-You were here in 1 978, weren't you?
-What's your point?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.417
-We need them back.
-Can't have them.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.460
Look at it as you were blessed
with having them

10:28.545 --> 10:30.379
33 years longer than you were supposed to.

10:33.675 --> 10:37.094
Bureaucrat to bureaucrat,
can't you just look the other way?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.807
-No.
-Forgive me, Father, but this is bullshit.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.267
Those statues belong here.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.520
Not according to the books.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.606
l know Michelle Obama.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.444
-What?
-You heard me.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.622
Tuna on raisin bread.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.542
You remembered.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.777
l'll take that as a yes.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.739
-You're such a dork.
-l know.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.081
-Shit!
-lt's my house key.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.916
Jesus!

11:50.001 --> 11:51.251
l think l...

11:51.836 --> 11:53.295
l think l cracked a filling.

11:53.588 --> 11:55.089
Boo, l'm so sorry. lt was...

11:57.258 --> 11:59.510
You put a key in my sandwich?

11:59.594 --> 12:04.556
Yeah, it was my romantic way of asking you
to come over whenever you want.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.850
l saw it in a movie.
This is the next level, boo.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.771
Don't put stuff in my food, Lenny.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.109
But it...

12:22.867 --> 12:24.993
-Those are the parents?
-Yep.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.705
l'm not sure how to maneuver this one.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.999
Yeah, l tried with the husband.
lt's not happening.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.794
With the parents, who knows?

12:34.546 --> 12:36.755
-May l?
-Please.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.095
Okay, so here's the deal.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.806
Geela's injuries are life-threatening.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.810
-We've already signed off on the surgery.
-No.

12:49.894 --> 12:51.186
This can't happen here.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.564
This is about Geela,
not some goddamn superstition.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.899
-She makes her own choices now.
-You've turned her into a zealot.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.569
We're wasting time. Please, move her.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.195
Well, she's too delicate to transport.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.613
l have faith that everything will be fine.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.574
You're standing on ceremony
at a time like this?

13:03.658 --> 13:06.743
-Can you help me?
-lf you want her to help, let them operate.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.246
-You dragged her into this cult.
-lt's not a cult.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.873
This is not about what l want.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.916
This is about what l really believe
Geela would want.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.543
She doesn't know
what she wants since she married you.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.463
She adopted this life.
l didn't drag her into it.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.841
l'm trying to give her what she wants.
Why won't...

13:21.426 --> 13:23.093
She's my wife.

13:23.845 --> 13:25.345
Why won't any of you help me do this?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.476
l will.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.773
-Lenny, l need your rig.
-l can't. l'm on a run.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.358
Drunk with a broken leg in Madison Park.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.444
No, l need you to transport
a patient to Beth lsrael.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.488
-You got to do it right now.
-My hands are tied.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.531
Dispatch won't allow
a driver to pull off an existing run.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.408
-l don't have a lot of time.
-Call 91 1 .

13:46.493 --> 13:48.869
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-No.

13:51.456 --> 13:54.208
l need you to send an ambulance
to All Saints emergency room.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.959
Ask for Jackie.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.296
Yes, l know how this sounds.
Get your asses here ASAP.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.328
l am Catholic.

14:31.412 --> 14:34.456
l could have this entire conversation
in Latin if you'd like.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.793
The removal of statues
breaks my heart, as well.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.256
What will you do with them?

14:42.340 --> 14:46.218
-A storage facility on Staten lsland.
-Staten lsland?

14:49.764 --> 14:51.348
Can you at least give me
a couple of extra weeks

14:51.432 --> 14:54.268
so that my staff can say their goodbyes?

14:54.686 --> 14:56.979
l'll see to it personally
that the statues will stay

14:57.063 --> 14:59.022
till the last possible day.

14:59.107 --> 15:03.527
And l assure you that their removal
will be handled with reverence and care.

15:04.821 --> 15:09.783
Pillaging a hospital chapel,
nice work if you can get it.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.588
The ambulance is here.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.059
Would you tell them
to keep it down, please?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.811
They're freaking out about their carts.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.730
lf a vendor even abandons his cart
just for a second

15:39.814 --> 15:41.732
to take a piss, they get fined like crazy.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.234
-He's got three kids. He won't recover.
-Follow me.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.822
Hey, keep it down!

15:48.906 --> 15:50.532
Tell them to give me their phones.

15:56.289 --> 16:00.334
Scroll for home. Talk to the families.
Tell them to get the carts.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.543
That's smart.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.712
Yeah, you might have
thought of that one yourself, Sam.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.509
Pardon me.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.104
Hey, man!

16:21.856 --> 16:23.190
Guys!

16:52.679 --> 16:55.305
l don't have what you're looking for.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.973
l come in peace.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.229
Walk with me?

17:12.323 --> 17:14.157
Give me your wallet.

17:15.660 --> 17:20.080
l'm going out for a cup of coffee.
lf l end up dead, this guy did it.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.379
You're popular here.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.340
l know them from meetings.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.551
AA, NA.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.846
Relax, l'm a former drug
and alcohol counselor.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.182
Former.

17:39.267 --> 17:43.520
l got tired of pouring my life force
into people who weren't ready to get sober.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.731
How compassionate.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.066
Usually people who succumbed
to bullshit interventions

17:48.151 --> 17:50.360
who then tried to get sober
for all the wrong reasons.

17:50.695 --> 17:54.531
l burned out watching people relapse
after getting sober too soon.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.241
So l decided to specialize.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.870
l'm the guy who helps people bottom out,

18:00.288 --> 18:03.290
find their all-time low
by supplying them with drugs

18:03.374 --> 18:06.293
and then supervising
their downward spiral for a hefty price.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.130
-That's repulsive.
-l take people right to the edge

18:10.214 --> 18:12.090
till they beg for sobriety.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.719
l trawl the rooms
looking for the weakest pie-eyed newbies

18:15.803 --> 18:18.138
with 30, 60, 90 days of sobriety,

18:18.222 --> 18:20.891
wait for them to relapse,
and then l make my move.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.642
Why are you telling me this?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.394
l'm tired of lightweights.

18:26.397 --> 18:32.027
This belonged to that woman over there.
She hit 30 days. Not ready.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.494
What l'm saying is
if you need my help, l'll be around.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.165
No, l'm good.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.959
l've dealt with addicts for 20 years.

18:48.419 --> 18:52.506
You took drugs off a man
having an epileptic seizure.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.217
New low. Well done.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.601
Hypothetically,

19:05.978 --> 19:07.521
how far am l from hitting bottom?

19:07.605 --> 19:08.688
Not even close.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.000
l got lives to save.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.137
You got a minute for a snack?

19:41.222 --> 19:43.723
-A smoke?
-Nope, sorry.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.268
Come on, that could be us.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.731
Honestly, l'm just swamped today.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.317
-Rain check?
-Yes.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.194
-You okay?
-Yes, go.

19:58.656 --> 20:02.242
-l don't even get fantasy football.
-Then problem solved. Bye-bye.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.788
This just isn't any fantasy football league.

20:06.873 --> 20:11.418
lt's all the hotshot doctors upstairs
who've always looked down on the ER.

20:11.502 --> 20:14.504
-lt's five grand a head.
-Five grand?

20:14.589 --> 20:18.091
And you're trying to bribe me
with a Quiznos combo meal?

20:19.260 --> 20:23.305
Come on, these guys are assholes
of the highest order.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.849
Seriously, they're only letting me in
because they think l'm easy money.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.226
And why should
l help you join a club of assholes?

20:28.311 --> 20:31.980
We win this, the ER
earns the respect it deserves.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.735
They're no different
than the bullies l knew in the fourth grade,

20:36.819 --> 20:39.821
the ones who gave me shit
for having gay moms.

20:46.329 --> 20:48.622
Dude, they called me Martina.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.708
Oh, my God,
you're so much prettier than she is.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.126
Thank you.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.131
-l'll help you.
-Yeah!

20:59.467 --> 21:01.051
Thor is the man!

21:09.185 --> 21:11.686
A doctor bought me lunch.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.689
Carry on.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.826
-He put a key in my sandwich.
-l see.

21:27.703 --> 21:31.456
l saw that once in a movie.
He wants you to come over more.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.086
God, l'm conflicted.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.797
Go on.

21:40.716 --> 21:45.762
lt's like one minute l'm just crazy about him,
l want to rip his clothes off.

21:46.722 --> 21:52.060
And the next l just want to stab him
in the neck with a fork.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.771
l saw that once in a movie, too.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.693
lt's not just that he cracked my filling.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.112
l just wish he would,

22:02.196 --> 22:06.533
you know, slow the fuck down, son.

22:06.617 --> 22:09.744
You trust your gut. Date other people.

22:13.708 --> 22:16.876
l confess l wanted to ask you out.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.839
Thanks,

22:21.757 --> 22:24.050
but it'd be too much pressure to date God.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.885
Good point.

22:46.574 --> 22:49.451
-Fuck!
-What did you do?

22:49.910 --> 22:51.995
-l gave Zoey a key to my place.
-Nice.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.498
-Then l cracked her filling.
-Romantic.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.375
l put my key in her sandwich and...

22:57.460 --> 22:59.127
-Holy shit, Lenny.
-l know, right?

22:59.754 --> 23:01.796
Please help a bonehead out.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.257
Stop trying to handcuff her.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.259
Give her some space,
she will make a beeline to you.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.553
l just want to be with her.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.515
Then let her come to you.
Suffocation is not really much of a turn-on.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.683
Lenny, please.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.521
-Stop it.
-Wait.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.440
-Stop it.
-Wait, wait. Why?

23:20.524 --> 23:24.027
You have enough kickers, okay?
You need more defense.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.155
A good offense is a good defense, isn't it?

23:28.115 --> 23:31.659
-Look, do you want my help or not?
-l do.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.204
Okay, then here's the rule,
you don't get to type.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.247
You get to stand there and look pretty.

23:36.332 --> 23:37.415
l can do that.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.757
Oh, no. No, you don't. Not these two.

23:46.300 --> 23:47.592
They're architectural embellishments

23:47.676 --> 23:50.303
that do not fall within
the scope of the chapel.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.638
Nice catch.

23:55.309 --> 23:56.810
Jesus Christ.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.898
-l'm an idiot.
-A little bit.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.692
l don't mean to pressure you.

24:04.777 --> 24:09.197
l just love being with you, you know,
no matter what form that takes.

24:09.824 --> 24:13.493
l'm sorry if it felt like l handcuffed you.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.249
What?

24:20.292 --> 24:24.504
At this very moment,
l have no desire to stab you in the neck.

24:24.839 --> 24:25.964
Cool.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.314
Really, Miss Barkow?

24:43.691 --> 24:48.111
Really? Really?

24:54.952 --> 24:56.452
Get a haircut!

25:00.583 --> 25:01.708
Where did you get this?

25:03.252 --> 25:04.586
l made it.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.213
You have till the count of three.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.381
One!

25:12.219 --> 25:13.386
Jesus.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.184
We're just waiting for my father.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.310
We're not open.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.273
No, we're here for Dad.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.746
-l have to tell you something.
-Okay.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.249
Aunt Tunie's pilot needed space.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.417
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

26:26.502 --> 26:29.212
-What's a sugar daddy?
-That's nice. Did you have dinner?

26:29.797 --> 26:31.005
Beer nuts and cherries.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.884
-Thank you.
-For what?

26:34.969 --> 26:38.179
Hey, girls, Aunt Tunie is going to stay
with us for a couple of weeks.

26:38.264 --> 26:39.347
Weeks?

26:39.974 --> 26:41.015
You're good with that, right?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.434
Yeah, yeah, it's fine with me.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.104
We shouldn't have to check in
with each other about every little thing.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.940
This is going to be so good for us.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.735
-l saw your friend Eddie at work today.
-He called.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.445
-Thanks again.
-Yeah.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.906
Eddie, that's the one you want me
to go out with, right?

26:56.991 --> 27:00.994
l don't know. Just a thought.
The last one broke his heart.
