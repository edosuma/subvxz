WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.268
(monitors beeping,
air hoses hissing)
okay, people. Mmm.

00:03.270 --> 00:05.137
Tavi is a minimally
invasive way

00:05.139 --> 00:07.272
Of replacing a diseased
aortic valve.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.274
In the old days,
we would crack the chest,

00:09.276 --> 00:10.476
Do open heart surgery.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.144
But this takes way less time,

00:12.146 --> 00:15.114
And for some high-risk patients,
it's the only option.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.684
So today we are going to
replace our diseased pig's valve

00:18.686 --> 00:21.020
With one made of
bovine tissue.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.688
Okay, we're gonna go in
percutaneously

00:22.690 --> 00:24.223
Through the femoral artery,

00:24.225 --> 00:27.493
Up through the chest,
insert and deploy the valve.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.561
And voilà, wilbur has
a new lease on life.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.563
You've exposed
the femoral artery?

00:31.565 --> 00:35.034
Lin, what's next?
Cannulate the left and right
femoral artery with sheaths.

00:35.036 --> 00:39.138
How do you deal with
a left suicide ventricle? Reid?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.206
Suicide ventricle.
Um...

00:41.208 --> 00:43.575
It is a very rare
condition that--
you're stalling.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.110
Reycraft?

00:45.112 --> 00:47.146
Bolus saline
and beta blockers.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.615
Excellent. In 2010,
"the new England journal"

00:49.617 --> 00:51.450
Published a multicenter trial

00:51.452 --> 00:53.218
On tavi recipients.

00:53.220 --> 00:57.423
How many patients were
in that study, reid?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.158
I'm sorry, dr. Bell.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.527
Gonna have to get back
to you.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.729
The answer is 358.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.631
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05.633 --> 01:07.499
The patients of hope zion
are in good hands

01:07.501 --> 01:10.369
Because although dr. Reid
doesn't know the answer,

01:10.371 --> 01:12.271
She will get back to us.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.705
(laughs)

01:13.707 --> 01:17.176
Okay, what do you say we save
these pigs' lives, huh?

01:21.481 --> 01:24.083
The contraindication
of performing this procedure?

01:24.085 --> 01:25.751
An a.C.L.-Deficient knee.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.253
Very good.
Dr. Blake, what else?

01:28.255 --> 01:31.356
Dr. Blake, you're going to be
in private practice

01:31.358 --> 01:33.492
In less than a year,
god help us. What else?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.727
A varus or valgus
deficiency?
<i>(man) ¶ there is somebody</i>

01:35.729 --> 01:39.665
Correct. A significant coronal
deformity would call for a--
<i>¶ I long to see</i>

01:39.667 --> 01:41.333
<i>¶ I hope that she</i>
<i>(clears throat)</i>

01:41.335 --> 01:43.635
<i>¶ turns out to be</i>

01:43.637 --> 01:47.439
Dr. Murphy, could you ask your
patient to keep it down, please?
<i>¶ someone who'll watch</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:48.740
<i>¶ over me</i>

01:48.742 --> 01:50.776
Uh, a significant coronal
deformity would call for

01:50.778 --> 01:52.511
A full or... (sighs)
<i>¶ I'm a little lamb</i>

01:52.513 --> 01:54.313
<i>¶ who's lost in the woods</i>

01:54.315 --> 01:56.415
<i>¶ I know I could</i>
<i>dr. Murphy,</i>

01:56.417 --> 01:59.184
Could you ask your patient
to please keep it d--
<i>¶ always</i>

01:59.186 --> 02:01.587
(singing stops,
equipment hissing, beeping)

02:01.589 --> 02:03.522
Uh...

02:03.524 --> 02:04.790
Oh...

02:04.792 --> 02:07.493
I'm sorry. I thought
I heard... Singing.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.294
<i>¶ I'm a little lamb</i>

02:09.296 --> 02:12.397
<i>¶ who's lost in the woods</i>

02:12.399 --> 02:14.133
<i>¶ I know I could</i>

02:14.135 --> 02:16.535
<i>¶ could always be good</i>

02:16.537 --> 02:17.903
<i>¶ to one who'll watch</i>

02:17.905 --> 02:19.538
Must've been
out in the hallway.

02:19.540 --> 02:20.806
<i>¶ over me</i>

02:20.808 --> 02:22.741
I-I'm sorry to disturb you.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.911
Mr. Adams was
in a car accident last night.

02:27.413 --> 02:29.815
Dr. Harris?
<i>¶ won't you tell her please</i>

02:29.817 --> 02:32.551
<i>¶ to put on some speed?</i>
<i>We'll come back later</i>
<i>and check on your husband.</i>

02:32.553 --> 02:34.586
<i>¶ follow my lead</i>

02:34.588 --> 02:36.822

02:36.824 --> 02:40.459
Oliver adams, 35.
<i>¶ someone to watch</i>

02:40.461 --> 02:42.661
We'll need to get
a fine cut c.T. Of his spine

02:42.663 --> 02:44.429
And see exactly what it is
we're dealing with here.

02:44.431 --> 02:48.367
<i>¶ over</i>
<i>(clipboard clatters)</i>

02:48.369 --> 02:53.205
<i>¶ me</i>

02:53.207 --> 02:55.507
¶

02:58.444 --> 03:00.646
358 patients? Really?

03:00.648 --> 03:02.481
I mean, how were you
supposed to know that?
(machinery beeps)

03:02.483 --> 03:04.249
Well, I'm sure reycraft
knew the answer.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.251
Yeah, whatever. That guys
is so tightly wound

03:06.253 --> 03:08.187
He probably reads
flash cards in the shower.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.222
Well, dr. Bell is
an amazing surgeon.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.192
Yeah, but she blows
as a person.
I just need to get better.

03:13.194 --> 03:17.596
(machinery beeping)

03:17.598 --> 03:19.731
Catheter in?
Catheter's in.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.366
Any complications?
No.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.468
B.P.'s steady.
Heart rate normal.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.604
Getting ready to deploy
the valve.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.372
(hissing)

03:27.374 --> 03:28.974
(beep)

03:28.976 --> 03:31.610
(hissing stops, click)

03:31.612 --> 03:32.744
Valve deployed.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.479
(rapid beeping)

03:34.481 --> 03:36.615
Pig is tanking, reid.
What are you gonna do?

03:36.617 --> 03:38.217
Uh, do an angio.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.751
Uh, make sure I haven't
blocked the coronaries.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.386
(stammers)
you've got tombstones
on your e.K.G.,

03:41.388 --> 03:42.821
So you might want to keep
your pig alive

03:42.823 --> 03:44.623
While you do your sleuthing.
(sighs)

03:44.625 --> 03:45.791
(monitor flatlining)

03:45.793 --> 03:47.759
Dr. Reid, your pig
is in v-fib.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.628
(clatters)
(alex) okay.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.732
(panting)

03:53.734 --> 03:55.534
(beeping)

03:55.536 --> 03:57.736
(continues panting)

03:58.805 --> 04:02.374
(buzzing)

04:02.376 --> 04:03.642
(monitor flatlining)

04:03.644 --> 04:06.278
I think I killed my pig.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.347
You deployed your valve
too high.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.648
You gave your pig
a heart attack.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.717
(beeping stops)
now if this were
a real patient,

04:11.719 --> 04:13.685
Dr. Reid would be spending
the next three years

04:13.687 --> 04:15.420
In legal depositions.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.522
Sloppy work,
but thank you

04:17.524 --> 04:19.591
For giving us all
a teachable moment.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.926
(beep)

04:20.928 --> 04:23.262
I have two pigs?
(woman) no.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.796
(indistinct conversations)

04:24.798 --> 04:26.598
(alex sighs)

04:29.035 --> 04:30.435
Charlie.
Dawn.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.371
You got my message?
Yes.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.439
How are you?
Wow, you look great.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.341
Uh, thank you.
I-I feel good, dawn.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.577
How's, uh,
hope zion treating you?

04:38.579 --> 04:39.811
It's good.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.047
I mean, they still haven't
got my parking spot,

04:42.049 --> 04:43.882
But, um, it's familiar.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.784
Feels like home.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.686
Hey.
Hey.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.721
How'd it, uh, go?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.290
I killed my pig.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.026
Ooh. Call the <i>hambulance.</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>

04:54.028 --> 04:57.663
Dawn, what, uh, what did
you page me about?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.965
Well, um, you're gonna
think this is ridiculous,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.700
Because it is.

05:01.702 --> 05:04.369
But I finally sold
the condo,

05:04.371 --> 05:06.438
And one of the movers
found this

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
Behind one of the cabinets.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.678
Peggy's cove.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.480
That was an amazing thing
that you did that weekend.

05:15.482 --> 05:19.384
This, uh, dog was drowning,
and I rescued it.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.719
Anybody would have
done that, dawn.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.654
It's no big deal.
He's being humble.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.089
I'm sure he is.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.092
You should get him to
tell you the story sometime.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.994
I just thought maybe
you would want to have it,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.796
For memory's sake.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.667
Joel.
Hey.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.002
Uh, how's that o.R.
Schedule coming?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.404
Uh, the same.

05:39.406 --> 05:42.641
Yeah, it's amazing we ever
got on without him.

05:43.943 --> 05:47.012
Nice lobster.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.615
(inhales)

05:50.617 --> 05:53.552
(velcro rips)
8 1/2. Ohio state.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.553
Okay.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.621
Oy. Uh, 48, uh...
Sam?

05:56.623 --> 05:59.424
Uh... Over. Nickel.
(whispers) okay.

05:59.426 --> 06:00.992
(normal voice) done. Done.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.795
(beep)
done. Don't look at me
in that tone of voice.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.130
Turn off the phone, sam.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.532
(click)
what's the problem, sam?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.702
Uh, they were giving me
this, you know--the thing.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.104
The ct.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.406
I got a terrible pain.

06:15.441 --> 06:16.775
(clicks pen)
so me where it hurts.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.778
(inhales) I thought
you'd never ask.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.681
It's all yours.
Oh. (laughs) you rascal.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.517
(groans) if I'd known
I'd live this long...

06:25.519 --> 06:27.719
(groans) I would have taken
better care of myself.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.522
You're only 55.
Are you kidding?

06:30.524 --> 06:31.990
That's 112 in hustler years.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.725
<i>(cell phone ringtone</i>
<i>plays "call to the post")</i>

06:33.727 --> 06:35.427
Oh, sorry.
I thought I turned that off.

06:35.429 --> 06:36.928
Dr. Lin.
I thought I turned it off.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.063
Phone.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.132
(groans) no--

06:40.134 --> 06:42.167
Ahh! There goes
my livelihood.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.902
She's usually a lot nicer
than this.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.971
What happened, you kill someone
this morning?

06:45.973 --> 06:48.507
No way.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.075
What are the odds?

06:50.077 --> 06:51.576
(gloves snap)

06:51.578 --> 06:53.812
He has some
lower abdominal pain.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.515
Let me guess.
That's not good.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.916
It's nothing conclusive.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.918
Give you even money
it's cancer.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.920
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm not supposed to wager

07:01.922 --> 07:03.455
On a patient's pathology.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.190
Dr. Reid?
Smart.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.692
Save your money.
My lifestyle.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.961
The question isn't "why me?"
but "why not me"?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.763
(all laugh)

07:11.765 --> 07:13.165
(monitor beeping rapidly)
(groaning and coughing)

07:13.167 --> 07:15.033
Sam?
Lie back, mr. Roth.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.501
Jeez. I can't breathe!

07:16.503 --> 07:17.836
I think he's having
a heart attack.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.504
(groans)

07:22.875 --> 07:24.576
Emma nolan. I treated her
two months ago

07:24.578 --> 07:25.911
For a clavicle contusion
suffered on a school trip,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.779
But it hasn't really
resolved.
C.T.?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.981
Uh, yeah. As you can see,
it shows no fracture

07:29.983 --> 07:32.584
In the neck or spine,
but there's some inflammation.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.654
Yeah, there's a bright spot
above the left clavicle.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.855
Yeah, sarcoma?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.757
Too early to tell.
We need to get a sample.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.126
That's what I was thinking,
so I set up a biopsy tray.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.794
Got it all ready for you.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.464
Hi. Dr. Goran.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.631
Emma.
Hi, doctor.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.200
What's wrong with her?

07:48.202 --> 07:49.935
And these are my parents.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.470
Based on emma's imaging,

07:51.472 --> 07:53.572
We're not exactly sure
what it is yet.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.774
(woman whispers) oh, god.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.476
Okay.

07:57.478 --> 07:59.478
Emma, I'm gonna need to biopsy
this growth.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.979
Does that hurt?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.515
It shouldn't be too bad.
Why don't you like back

08:03.517 --> 08:05.217
And, uh, make yourself
comfortable, okay?

08:05.219 --> 08:07.018
Okay.
Your mom can help you.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.189
Uh, can I keep
my socks on?

08:11.191 --> 08:14.726
I'm freezing, plus I have
the world's ugliest feet.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.628
(chuckles) of course
you can.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.498
(children speaking indistinctly
in distance)

08:19.500 --> 08:21.266
My friends are never going
to believe...

08:21.268 --> 08:23.068
(woman sighs)
how cute you are.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.571
Emma.
Too late. Already up
on facebook. (laughs)

08:26.573 --> 08:29.541
Sorry.
No, actually, that's, uh,

08:29.543 --> 08:30.909
That's really
rather flattering.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.911
Oh, god.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.715
It's okay.
It's okay, mom.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.185
It's gonna be okay.
(sniffles)

08:40.187 --> 08:41.686
All right, emma.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.955
This is gonna pinch
just a little bit.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.858
Okay.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.960
(gasping)

08:50.796 --> 08:52.597
Charlie's freakin' angels.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.032
(beep)
mr. Roth, please.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.934
I'm trying to get
a proper read here.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.303
How come all the doctors I know
are old, bald jewish guys?

08:58.305 --> 09:01.840
Please stop talking.
(beeping)

09:01.842 --> 09:04.209
(whispers) anyone up for
a <i>ménage à quatre?</i>

09:04.211 --> 09:06.278
(laughs)
sam.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.981
There's no question
he has aortic stenosis.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.550
Along with the mass
on his colon.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.951
The daily double.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.619
Mr. Roth, I'm going to need
to schedule you in

09:14.621 --> 09:17.088
For a transcatheter valve
implantation.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.257
Now I'm gonna let dr. Reid
fill you in,

09:19.259 --> 09:20.992
Because she actually attempted

09:20.994 --> 09:22.827
Her first tavi procedure
this morning.

09:22.829 --> 09:23.828
Dr. Bell?

09:23.830 --> 09:26.097
There still is
the colon issue.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.633
It'll wait.
I'm not sure that it will.

09:28.635 --> 09:31.102
He has marked s.T. Elevation
and frequent p.V.C.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.271
It can wait.
That's not necessarily true,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.807
Because I feel that
if his tumor...

09:37.643 --> 09:39.744
Could we take this outside?
Mm-hmm.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.746
Just a minute, sam.
No, no.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.615
No, no. Don't go.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.850
Beautiful women arguing
over my colon.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.320
It'll never happen again.

09:48.322 --> 09:50.689
Will you book mr. Roth in
for a tavi, please?
Right away.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.692
What's going on?
Don't challenge me in front
of my patient, please.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.328
He's my patient, too, dawn.
Brush up on your anatomy, alex.
Heart trumps colon.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.797
It's the reason
I'm paid more money than you.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.231
And if the tumor
is malignant?

10:00.233 --> 10:02.067
Then it will still be malignant
six weeks from now,

10:02.069 --> 10:03.668
When we can safely
remove it.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.070
But I-I think--

10:05.072 --> 10:07.906
You give me
a sound medical argument

10:07.908 --> 10:09.941
In ten seconds or less
to do the colon first,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.043
Or we are done here. Go.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.079
(scoffs)

10:14.081 --> 10:17.782
Oh. We're actually doing this.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.219
Uh, the colon.
Okay, this tumor--

10:21.221 --> 10:23.288
If it's cancerous,
and we haven't properly--

10:23.290 --> 10:25.890
Time's up.
(clears throat) thank you.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.996
What just happened?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.964
(gasps) dawn just got
herself a new patient.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.165
Oh.

10:35.801 --> 10:39.938
These are your husband's
scan results.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.973
He has what's called
a vertebral aneurysm.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.975
Basically, an artery
in your husband's neck

10:43.977 --> 10:45.410
That supplies his brain

10:45.412 --> 10:46.978
Has a blockage.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.980
And that's why he's not
waking up?
Yes.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.281
Well, can you operate?

10:50.283 --> 10:52.917
I'm not afraid not.
With the, um, location

10:52.919 --> 10:55.720
Of this particular blockage,
it would be too dangerous.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.255
(monitor beeping)

10:57.257 --> 10:59.224
Oh, my god.

10:59.226 --> 11:03.361
In the meantime, I'd like to
repair his cervical fracture.

11:03.363 --> 11:04.796
(exhales)

11:04.798 --> 11:06.798
What's the point?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.833
It's an unstable fracture.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.270
Uh, really, the halo
is just a temporary measure.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.406
God.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.208
Last night we were fi--

11:17.210 --> 11:18.777
We were fighting again.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.112
And then I said some
awful things to him.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.147
Mrs. Adams--

11:22.149 --> 11:23.882
<i>¶ although I may not be</i>

11:23.884 --> 11:25.417
<i>¶ the man some</i>

11:25.419 --> 11:27.819
I said that if he--he doesn't
make it on broadway by now,

11:27.821 --> 11:30.155
Then odds are
he never will.

11:30.157 --> 11:33.425
<i>¶ girls think of as handsome</i>

11:33.427 --> 11:36.161
And that all he would
ever be is a wedding singer.

11:36.163 --> 11:39.030
(scoffs) that I was tired
of supporting us.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.132
<i>¶ to her heart</i>
<i>I'll carry ¶</i>

11:41.134 --> 11:45.036
<i>¶ the key</i>

11:45.038 --> 11:47.772
I literally--
I threw my car keys at him.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.375
(shudders)
it's not your fault.
You shouldn't blame yourself.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.410
I do. And now I...

11:52.412 --> 11:53.778
(exhales)

11:53.780 --> 11:55.780
Um...

11:55.782 --> 11:57.115
His mother...
(breathes sharply)

11:57.117 --> 11:59.350
Was in palliative care.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.453
A.L.S.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.423
We had this conversation...

12:05.425 --> 12:07.258
A hundred times.

12:09.128 --> 12:13.431
He told me that he wouldn't
want to live like this.

12:19.171 --> 12:20.805
Um...

12:20.807 --> 12:22.741
You should try
and get some rest.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.042
Uh, I can come back
and check on you

12:24.044 --> 12:25.443
In just a little bit.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.811
Fine.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.413
Thank you.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.286
(clears throat)

12:44.964 --> 12:47.365
Okay. You need to tell me
what you want.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.802
<i>¶ won't you tell her, please,</i>
<i>to put on some speed ¶</i>

12:50.804 --> 12:52.837
No, no, no, no.
Stop with the singing.

12:52.839 --> 12:54.539
Okay? You heard your wife.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.074
She thinks she knows
what you want.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.042
You need to tell me
if that's true.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.045
<i>¶ follow my lead,</i>
<i>oh, how I need ¶</i>

13:01.047 --> 13:02.514
Stop-- (babbles rapidly)
<i>¶ someone--</i>

13:02.516 --> 13:05.984
Stop with the melody.
Just--your wife is in there.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.986
She is about to give up
on you.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.521
Okay?
(sighs)

13:10.823 --> 13:12.824
Alex.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.393
Hey.
Hi.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.996
(hums softly)

13:21.000 --> 13:23.968
I need to ask you
a question. Um...

13:23.970 --> 13:25.270
Okay.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.206
Did you ever doubt
I'd come back?

13:30.843 --> 13:32.544
Got anything smaller
on your mind?

13:32.546 --> 13:35.213
Well... Just tell me.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.282
Did you, um...

13:37.284 --> 13:39.250
Did you doubt it?

13:42.054 --> 13:45.957
I mean, I had my moments,
for sure, but...

13:45.959 --> 13:48.493
I always knew
you'd come back.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.863
Why?

13:51.865 --> 13:53.565
I don't know.
It sounds crazy.

13:53.567 --> 13:57.168
Oh, I'm--I'm doing crazy now,
so try me.
(laughs)

14:00.239 --> 14:02.540
I could still feel you here.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.444
You know, it was like you were
telling me to keep fighting.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.914
Like I was telling you
to keep fighting.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.283
Ah, it's crazy, I know.
(laughs)

14:12.285 --> 14:13.985
Nope.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.933
Dr. Murphy.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.935
Um...

14:30.937 --> 14:32.470
How do you deal
with a patient

14:32.472 --> 14:35.340
That won't tell you the thing
that you need to help them?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.109
Well, uh, sounds like
every one of my patients.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.944
Well, what do you--
what do you do?

14:39.946 --> 14:42.247
Is this, like,
an official consult?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.581
No, it's more like
an official question.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.484
Okay, well, you want to
continue to build

14:46.486 --> 14:47.919
A rapport with them,

14:47.921 --> 14:49.220
Make sure
that they trust you.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.622
Then just don't give up.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.190
Stay on 'em.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.058
Never know when a breakthrough
is gonna happen.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.027
Okay. Thank you.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.096
I'm going to book an o.R.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.164
To fuse that
wedding singer's fracture.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.667
Okay. And you're
telling me because?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.969
Because I'd like you to
stay close to his wife.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.171
She's... Blaming herself.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.573
I actually just got off
the phone with her.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.642
She wants me to come back in
to talk about her options.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.076
Her options for what?

15:12.078 --> 15:14.078
For end of life preparation.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.248
W-we can't do that.
We don't know what he wants yet.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.350
They have had
the conversation.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.585
Uh...

15:20.587 --> 15:23.154
People can change
their minds, gavin.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.524
I know this must
hit close to home for you.
This is not about me.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.927
It's very common
after suffering a trauma

15:28.929 --> 15:32.263
To associate people--
don't shrink me, son, okay?
That will not end well.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.998
Okay? Any decisions get made,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.334
I want to be consulted
first, okay?

15:37.536 --> 15:38.536
All due respect, dr. Harris,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.405
But you're
an orthopedic surgeon.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.174
All due respect, I have seen
things that you cannot imagine.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.445
(clears throat) listen,
I'm asking you

15:47.447 --> 15:50.615
As a colleague to, um,
keep me in the loop.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.584
Okay.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.720
Sure. Thanks.

15:55.722 --> 16:00.625
<i>(man on p.A.) code blue...</i>
<i>(continues indistinctly)</i>

16:00.627 --> 16:02.093
What does that mean,

16:02.095 --> 16:03.328
The biopsy results
are inconclusive?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.462
The sample size
is insufficient,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.331
So I need to do
an open procedure

16:06.333 --> 16:08.099
To get myself a larger piece
of that tumor.
More tests?

16:08.101 --> 16:09.634
Yes.
I don't believe this.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.303
Where is that done?
It's done
in the operating room.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.539
So, yes, your daughter will be
under general anesthetic.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.275
(voice breaks) can, I, uh,
can I be with her?

16:17.277 --> 16:18.509
No, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.211
You have to figure out
what this is.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.013
I'm trying, sir.
I really am.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.115
Mom... (exhales)

16:25.718 --> 16:27.618
What is it?

16:29.288 --> 16:31.055
Emma?

16:31.057 --> 16:33.324
What is that? Your left arm.
(sniffles)

16:33.326 --> 16:35.293
Lift it up for me.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.262
Lift it up higher
for me, please.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.398
(shudders)
that's as high as it can go.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
You're in pain.
It kills.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.170
It started right after you
did that needle thing.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.277
Let me just
look under here.

16:55.447 --> 16:57.648
There's a second mass.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.218
A-a-another one?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.786
Yeah.
Ohh.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.521
It wasn't there when I did
the biopsy before.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.224
It's--it's new.
(sighs) gross.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.093
You mean I'm, like,
sprouting lumps?

17:09.095 --> 17:10.228
Could the biopsy
have caused it?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.696
I don't know. I mean, it--

17:11.698 --> 17:14.632
Look, it does... Present
adjacent to the site. It's--

17:14.634 --> 17:17.168
So what you're saying is
you made it worse?

17:19.204 --> 17:22.673
<i>(woman speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>on p.A.)</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:26.611
Sam, what are you doing?

17:26.613 --> 17:29.414
It hurts too much.
I can't just lie there.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.650
It just feels much better
when I move around.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.085
Mm...

17:34.087 --> 17:36.120
Well, you--
you have to stay still.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.522
I can't. (groans)

17:37.524 --> 17:40.324
Okay, can you rate your pain
on a scale of 1 to 10?

17:40.326 --> 17:42.527
9, approaching, uh... (groans)

17:42.529 --> 17:44.762
Samba!
Okay, well, dr. Bell

17:44.764 --> 17:46.564
Is your surgeon, and I'm gonna
give her a call, okay?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.199
Yeah, but she scares
the hell out of me.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.434
Yeah, tell me about it.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.669
Dance with me, reid.
Whoa! I-I don't dance.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.272
Is that a religious
or a rhythmic thing? (groans)

17:54.274 --> 17:55.473
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!
(groans)

17:55.475 --> 17:57.141
Your belly is more distended.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.677
I need to take you back
to imaging.
(groans) yeah.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.313
(groaning) ooh...

18:02.315 --> 18:03.748
Dr. Lin.
Ooh!

18:03.750 --> 18:05.550
I'm taking mr. Roth in
for an emergency c.T.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.285
Then we're going dancing.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.820
(sighs) his pain is worsening,
and I'm worried about it.

18:08.822 --> 18:10.555
About an obstruction?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.156
But shouldn't you check
with dr. Bell first?
(sighs)

18:12.158 --> 18:13.524
(groans)
I should, yes,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.193
But given the day we've had--

18:15.195 --> 18:16.561
Check that,
the year we've had--

18:16.563 --> 18:18.563
Maybe you should make
the call.
Of course.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.132
In, say, five minutes.
Sorry?

18:21.134 --> 18:23.234
Just give me a bit
of a head start.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.303
Got it.
Thank you.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.672
(groaning)

18:27.674 --> 18:30.174
If we're not back
in 20 minutes,

18:30.176 --> 18:31.642
Call the cops. (laughs)

18:35.681 --> 18:37.248
I'm his surgeon,

18:37.250 --> 18:38.583
And she doesn't feel the need
to consult me?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.151
That's not true.
Dr. Lin called.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.586
When the patient is halfway
through the machine.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.454
Yeah, I made a judgment call.
That's not your job.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.189
My patient...
My patient.
He's my patient.

18:45.191 --> 18:47.325
Has a complete malignant
large bowel obstruction.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.327
Okay? The resection
needs to be done now.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.596
He's not gonna survive
a major colonic resection.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.197
His heart is too weak.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.500
The preload alone will make him
code on the table.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.435
And when his cecum explodes,

18:57.437 --> 18:59.337
What happens to
his preload then?
Do you ladies even
need me for this?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.306
Uh, well, yes, joel,
because you're the chief,

19:02.308 --> 19:03.808
And we need a medical
opinion.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.477
My medical opinion is...
(clears throat)

19:06.479 --> 19:08.246
I think you should tag team.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.414
By that, I mean you should do
both your surgeries

19:10.416 --> 19:11.649
At the same time.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.850
I'm not sharing
the o.R. With her.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.352
Fine. You just asked me
my opinion.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.887
I gave it to you.
If you'll excuse me,

19:15.889 --> 19:17.455
I have a budget
to revise here,

19:17.457 --> 19:19.323
I have a breast cancer walk
I need to stretch for...

19:19.325 --> 19:22.627
(phone rings)
and my phone will not stop...

19:22.629 --> 19:24.862
Ringing. Yeah.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.164
Yes?

19:26.166 --> 19:28.900
No, irene, I'm not
mad at you. I just--

19:28.902 --> 19:31.536
Yes, I will be right down.
(disconnects call)

19:31.538 --> 19:33.538
My patient needs me
in the o.R.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.440
You're both... Competent,

19:36.442 --> 19:38.709
So figure it out, okay?

19:41.880 --> 19:44.615
Dawn, this is about what's
best for the patient.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.651
You think
I don't know that?

19:46.653 --> 19:49.487
Won't you consider that
the colon might take precedent?

19:49.489 --> 19:50.655
No.
Why?

19:50.657 --> 19:52.423
Because if I were
to concede that

19:52.425 --> 19:54.225
And allow you to operate
on his belly,

19:54.227 --> 19:55.626
And something happened
to his heart,

19:55.628 --> 19:58.262
I don't trust that you
would know how to handle it.

19:58.264 --> 20:01.199
I know you think I'm mean.
I'm not. I'm frank.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.901
So this is about me?
As a doctor? Yes.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.570
It's not personal.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.938
Well, it feels like it is.

20:06.940 --> 20:09.574
Well, maybe you need
to stop feeling so much

20:09.576 --> 20:11.342
And start acting

20:11.344 --> 20:13.377
Like a surgeon.

20:13.379 --> 20:16.314
<i>(country music playing)</i>

20:18.283 --> 20:19.884
I can't stand country music.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.687
(laughs) talk to your surgeon.
His o.R. His playlist.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.922
What are you talking about?
This is an amazing song.
(clears throat)

20:24.924 --> 20:26.557
Sure. If you're
a depressive hillbilly.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.725
(laughing)
what?

20:27.727 --> 20:29.694
I like this girl.
(exhales) seriously.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.430
In two minutes,
this guy got drunk...
Mm-hmm.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.765
Cheating on his wife,
quit his job.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.535
He just keeps
making things worse.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.270
(chuckles)

20:39.272 --> 20:40.738
George...

20:40.740 --> 20:42.940
Wait. One--one second,
dr. Goran.

20:42.942 --> 20:46.611
(beep)
if anything happens to me,

20:46.613 --> 20:48.579
You've met my parents.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.281
They can handle it.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.618
The larger sample should
give us the information we need.

20:53.620 --> 20:56.254
(sighs)
come on.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.788
(beep)

20:57.790 --> 20:59.557
<i>¶ where did you sleep?</i>

20:59.559 --> 21:01.325
<i>¶ where did you stay?</i>
<i>Okay, emma, I'd like you</i>

21:01.327 --> 21:03.995
To start counting
backwards for me from 20.

21:03.997 --> 21:05.596
<i>¶ honey, I told you</i>

21:05.598 --> 21:07.632

21:07.634 --> 21:09.900

21:09.902 --> 21:11.836
Nine-nineteen...

21:11.838 --> 21:14.372
18...

21:14.374 --> 21:15.706
<i>¶</i>

21:15.708 --> 21:18.743
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:18.745 --> 21:21.879
Sam, we're gonna go ahead with
the heart procedure first.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.748
Mm, came up on the wrong end
of the stick, huh?

21:23.750 --> 21:27.485
Dr. Bell decided that this
was the best course of action.

21:28.487 --> 21:30.021
You almost said that
with a straight face.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.789
This isn't about me.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.624
This is about you
getting better.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.526
(sighs)

21:35.528 --> 21:37.995
What is that?
Oh, it's a little pastrami.
I'm starving.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.897
You can't eat before
a surgery.
(mutters)

21:39.899 --> 21:41.866
Hand it over!
Unbelievable.

21:41.868 --> 21:45.069
Dr. Bell is gonna be
in here shortly.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.004
She gets under your skin.

21:47.006 --> 21:50.541
You get around her, you lose
the ability to think clearly.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.743
I had someone like that
in my life once.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.745
What'd you do about it?

21:54.747 --> 21:56.747
I married her.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.916
(laughs)
(laughs)

21:58.918 --> 22:00.918
She died three years ago.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.987
Ovarian cancer.

22:04.356 --> 22:07.558
Is that when you stopped
taking care of yourself?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.027
(inhales sharply)

22:10.029 --> 22:12.330
You know, I-I got this, uh,

22:12.332 --> 22:14.999
Great widow with a--
a place in boca.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.934
She keeps begging me
to come down.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.936
Maybe it's time.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.706
If the opportunity presents.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.040
You gotta jump on it.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.643
"you gotta jump on it."
(chuckles)

22:25.645 --> 22:28.045
'cause you never know
how long you got

22:28.047 --> 22:30.948
Before your ass is flapping
in the blue gown.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.818
(laughs)
carpe diem!
Seize the widow!

22:33.820 --> 22:35.052
(breathes sharply)

22:35.054 --> 22:38.756
(deep voice)
seize the widow! (laughs)

22:38.758 --> 22:40.725
(laughs)

22:40.727 --> 22:43.094
(emma gasping)
jackson.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.695
I got it.
Very poor air entry.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.797
We were talking about
her grad dress.
Mm-hmm.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.699
She just started gasping.
What is happening to her?

22:48.701 --> 22:50.434
(gasping) I feel like
somebody's choking me.

22:50.436 --> 22:52.670
I-I c--I can't breathe!
Okay, sweetheart.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.071
She's got a hematoma
at the incision site.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.673
It's pressing on the airway,
jackson.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.074
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step outside, please.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.609
Outside, please.
Mom!

22:58.611 --> 23:00.044
Please!
Mommy!

23:00.046 --> 23:01.479
(shouting indistinctly)
no, no, no, no.
Look at me.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.581
Look at me. Look at me.
Listen to me.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.082
(gasping)
I need you to lie back for me.
Like back. That's it.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.485
Crash cart, please.
Jackson, move it.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.987
All right.
Can you clear her airway?

23:09.989 --> 23:11.555
Grab the pillow for me.
(gasping continues)

23:11.557 --> 23:14.859
Okay, I'm starting her on
13 milligrams of etomidate.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.994
Uh, 64 milligrams
of succinylcholine.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.596
Laryngoscope.
(beep)

23:18.598 --> 23:20.664
Thank you.
(clicks)

23:21.833 --> 23:23.000
(velcro rips)

23:23.002 --> 23:25.703
(beeping)

23:25.705 --> 23:27.405
Uh, e.T. Tube.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.508
No, I still can't visualize.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.909
All right, we've got
one more shot.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.544
Let's see.
Give me the bougie.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.781
(beeping)

23:36.783 --> 23:40.684
I've got absolutely no idea
what's wrong with this girl.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.424
(indistinct conversations)

23:48.126 --> 23:50.895
So... Emma developed
another complication.

23:50.897 --> 23:53.197
Ohh!
It was swelling
from the neck surgery.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.900
This has to stop!
But she is stable now,
so it's--

23:55.902 --> 23:57.601
I want to see her.
No, as soon
as she wakes up...

23:57.603 --> 23:58.769
(sighs)
you can.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.171
I want another doctor.

24:00.173 --> 24:02.006
Sir, I understand your
frustration with me right now,

24:02.008 --> 24:04.508
But I'm doing everything
I possibly can, okay?

24:04.510 --> 24:06.143
To what? Kill her?

24:06.145 --> 24:08.078
Philip. (sighs)

24:08.080 --> 24:11.148
Philip, why don't you go
and, uh, get us coffee?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.516
No. No way.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.685
No, really, please.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.520
I could really use
a coffee.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.956
I'm not leaving.
(whispers) please, baby.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.624
(sniffles)

24:20.626 --> 24:22.827
Okay?
(exhales) okay.

24:22.829 --> 24:30.534
Okay.
I should apologize.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.702
No, there's no need.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.772
He's not usually like this.
It's okay.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.708
Um...

24:37.710 --> 24:40.811
I, uh, miscarried...

24:40.813 --> 24:43.781
Uh, fi-five times, and, uh,

24:43.783 --> 24:47.685
We tried for nine years
and spent our whole life savings

24:47.687 --> 24:50.488
And, uh...

24:50.490 --> 24:52.490
(voice breaks)
then we had emma.

24:54.025 --> 24:57.094
She's everything to him.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.233
So it could be heterotopic.
Myositis.

25:02.235 --> 25:04.068
I mean, you can't rule out
sarcoma,

25:04.070 --> 25:05.836
But nothing's inclusive.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.104
Does he rule anything out?

25:07.106 --> 25:09.707
Uh, typhoid, apparently.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.008
Uh, peppermint tea, please.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.878
I'm off caffeine.
Doctor's orders.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.145
So what do you think?

25:15.147 --> 25:16.881
(clears throat)
I'm--I'm sorry, doctor.

25:16.883 --> 25:20.117
Are--are you asking
for my help?
Regretfully, yes, I am.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.686
Look, this girl's condition's
only getting worse.

25:22.688 --> 25:25.589
Okay?
Come on. Walk with me.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.626
(sighs and clears throat)

25:30.562 --> 25:31.996
So what do you make of it?

25:31.998 --> 25:33.964
The new pathologist
likes to cover his ass.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.833
Yeah.
(sighs)

25:35.835 --> 25:38.068
(chuckles) yep.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.571
You can frame that.
That's useless. (sighs)

25:40.573 --> 25:42.139
You know, I don't know
about you, joel,

25:42.141 --> 25:43.607
But I didn't get into the--
the bone business

25:43.609 --> 25:45.075
For these medical mysteries.
I hear you.

25:45.077 --> 25:46.744
We're supposed to use
real cool tools

25:46.746 --> 25:48.879
And fix broken things.
That's it. End of discussion.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.749
So what's the next move?
(sighs)

25:51.751 --> 25:53.017
Take her to the tumor board.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.251
No, there's not enough time
for that.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.719
I mean, I do think
I'm dealing with

25:55.721 --> 25:57.288
Some kind of aggressive
sarcoma here, you know?

25:57.290 --> 25:59.757
Well, then use those real
cool tools and cut it out.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.659
This thing's kicking my ass.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.127
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.

26:03.129 --> 26:06.196
I've got a wedding singer
with an inoperable aneurysm.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.732
Talking about pulling
the plug on him.
(clicks tongue)

26:08.734 --> 26:10.134
Sounds like someone I know.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.269
Except I had to come back.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.238
Someone was chasing
after my girl.

26:16.107 --> 26:17.942
What did you just say?

26:17.944 --> 26:20.177
I thought it was
pretty clear.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.914
Okay.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.350
(siren wailing in distance)

26:26.352 --> 26:29.653
<i>¶ hitch your worries</i>
<i>to a cloud ¶</i>

26:29.655 --> 26:32.690

No, enough with the singing

26:43.035 --> 26:45.302
You have to tell me!
Okay?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.171
You don't have time for this.

26:47.173 --> 26:50.174
Um, I'm... Thinking aloud.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.810
<i>(scoffs)</i>
<i>listen.</i>

26:54.245 --> 26:56.080

<i>(exhales)</i>

27:21.706 --> 27:23.307
<i>(whispers) I'm alive.</i>
<i>(snapping fingers)</i>

27:23.309 --> 27:24.742
Thank you.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.710
<i>I'm alive.</i>

27:26.712 --> 27:29.046
<i>I'm alive.</i>

27:30.248 --> 27:32.983
<i>I'm alive!</i>
<i>(snapping continues)</i>

27:32.985 --> 27:35.953
(air hose hissing,
monitors beeping)

27:39.958 --> 27:41.291
(knocks)

27:41.293 --> 27:45.663
(clears throat) I'd like
to talk to you, if I could.

27:47.065 --> 27:50.000
Dr. Murphy told me
about you.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.403
Oh, he did, did he?
What, uh...

27:52.405 --> 27:54.271
(wheels rolling)

27:54.273 --> 27:55.773
What did he have to say?

27:55.775 --> 27:59.076
(exhales) uh, that you
were in an accident.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.680
In a coma, like oliver,
and...

28:04.249 --> 28:05.816
That you came out of it.

28:05.818 --> 28:08.786
Well, every case
is different.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.220
Yeah, he said that, too.

28:10.222 --> 28:13.991
Said he didn't want to give me
any false hope.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.926
Well, I don't want to give you
any false hope, either,

28:15.928 --> 28:19.229
But I also don't want you
to rush into any decisions.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.166
See, my fiancée--
she held out longer

28:22.168 --> 28:25.169
Than anybody thought
she could or...

28:25.171 --> 28:26.937
Thought she should.

28:28.907 --> 28:32.042
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that...

28:32.044 --> 28:36.280
No matter which way this goes,
you have time.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.983
You know...

28:39.985 --> 28:43.220
Time to just be here
for him, or...

28:44.456 --> 28:47.191
Maybe watch over him
for a bit.

28:54.165 --> 28:55.933
Okay.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.903
Yeah. (exhales)

29:02.941 --> 29:05.309
I just love him so much.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.011
(crying)

29:08.013 --> 29:10.047
I'd do anything
to get him back.

29:11.082 --> 29:14.051
I know. I know.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.520
(exhales)

29:16.522 --> 29:19.456
<i>(man speaking indistinctly</i>
<i>on p.A.)</i>

29:19.458 --> 29:20.924
Dr. Bell.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.926
Alex. You lost?

29:22.928 --> 29:25.896
Mr. Roth's
valve replacement.

29:26.898 --> 29:28.265
I'd like permission
to assist.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.900
A few minutes ago,

29:29.902 --> 29:32.903
You were trying to show me up
in joel's office.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.172
I wasn't trying
to show you up, dawn.

29:35.174 --> 29:39.476
Because you're doing
the exact same operation

29:39.478 --> 29:41.311
That I struggled with
this morning.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.213
Mm, I think
that pig's family would

29:43.215 --> 29:45.816
Call it a little more
than struggling.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.852
I want to learn.
I want to watch it done right.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.255
There are other
cardiac surgeons.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.290
None as good as you.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.059
Dawn, you said that this
wasn't personal.

29:56.061 --> 29:58.295
It isn't.
Good. Then whatever
you think of me--

29:58.297 --> 29:59.997
Or you think of me.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.199
It doesn't matter.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.868
The only thing that matters
is me learning

30:04.870 --> 30:06.870
To deploy an aortic valve
at the proper height.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.207
The only thing that matters
is me getting better at my job.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.043
Congratulations,
dr. Reid,

30:13.045 --> 30:15.412
On your first compelling
argument of the day.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.048
(presses button)
scrub up.

30:20.885 --> 30:22.820
(exhales)

30:29.194 --> 30:30.894

30:34.465 --> 30:36.233

30:43.008 --> 30:45.209
You changed your playlist.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.044
Let's finish draping
and get on this.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.480
Such a sweet girl. She made me
promise not to look at her feet.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.449
Yeah, she hate those toes.
(chuckles)

30:52.451 --> 30:54.184

31:01.025 --> 31:02.226
Wake her up.
Sorry?

31:02.228 --> 31:04.027
D.C. Sedation.
Tube out. Tube out.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.129
Uh, dr. Goran?
I need to talk to her.
Wake her up.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.365
Tube out.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.268

32:12.964 --> 32:15.198
(monitor beeping rapidly)
oh, no.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.934
Damn it!
I must've hit the vert.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.669
Suction.
Patties and gel foam.

32:18.671 --> 32:22.172
Come on, guys.
He could be stroking.

32:22.174 --> 32:23.340
Foam.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.309
Hang on. I think I got it.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.576
B.P. Rising.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.146
Okay, we're back in business.
Um...

32:29.148 --> 32:30.514
Dr. Harris?

32:30.516 --> 32:33.951
Crossbars, please. What?
The neuromonitor. Look.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.022
That's new brain activity.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.024
How is that happening?

32:41.026 --> 32:43.560
I don't know. The, um...

32:43.562 --> 32:46.563
Misplaced screw must've
somehow released the aneurysm.

32:46.565 --> 32:49.399
So blood flow's reaching
his brain?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.435
(machinery beeps)

32:51.437 --> 32:54.037
I guess so.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.172
So is there anything
that you haven't told me

32:55.174 --> 32:57.107
About these bumps?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.109
This isn't the first time

32:59.111 --> 33:01.311
You've experienced
this kind of thing, is it?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.280
Oh, no,
you can't tell them.

33:03.282 --> 33:06.183
They'll be so upset
that I didn't tell them.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.651
When was the first time?

33:07.653 --> 33:09.553
(sighs)

33:09.555 --> 33:11.421
I was 8.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.657
Fell off my bike.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.693
My parents saw the bruise--
a big lump.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.062
Then it went away.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.465
But the pain didn't
go away.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.167
No, not for...

33:24.169 --> 33:26.470
Not for a really long time.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.573
Right, okay. Have you had
any flare-ups since?

33:29.575 --> 33:30.774
A few.

33:30.776 --> 33:34.011
Usually happens
after I fall

33:34.013 --> 33:36.380
Or bumping into something.

33:40.284 --> 33:43.286
Emma, I think I know
what you have.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.691
(monitor beeping steadily)

33:47.693 --> 33:49.359
(dawn) rapid pacing, please.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.527

33:51.629 --> 33:54.031
Valve successfully deployed.

33:54.033 --> 33:56.600
No paravalvular leaks.
Patient is stable.

33:56.602 --> 34:00.437
Heart functioning normally.
No wall motion abnormalities.

34:00.439 --> 34:03.306
Dr. Reid, how do we know
it's time to get out of here?

34:03.308 --> 34:05.642
You check the positioning
with an angiogram

34:05.644 --> 34:07.044
And the function
with an echo.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.211
Mm-hmm.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.546
Removing the sheath.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.350
And... We're good.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.786
And    <i>th</i>is how
you do a tavi.

34:15.788 --> 34:17.754
(monitor beeps)
put a stitch in it.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.523
I might just make my dinner.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.657
Dr. Bell?
Yep?

34:20.659 --> 34:22.292
B.P.'s dropping.
What?

34:22.294 --> 34:24.261
He's getting tachy.
What? That was seamless.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.529
B.P.'s crashing.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

34:25.531 --> 34:27.531
The valve is fine.
It's his colon, dawn.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.299
It's ruptured.
Let's get the prep.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.134
Get that c-arm out of my way!
I gotta get in now.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.502
I'm gonna need your help
with this.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.771
Of course. Retractor.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.339
Knife.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.513
Whoa. There it is.

34:43.515 --> 34:44.681
Ohh, whoa!

34:44.683 --> 34:46.616
Sponges.
Ugh! That reeks!

34:46.618 --> 34:48.285
His cecum exploded.

34:48.287 --> 34:51.755
His abdominal cavity is filled
with fecal matter.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.190
Suction.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.558
We need to mobilize
the bowel.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.692
Cautery.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.494
(suction gurgling)

35:00.431 --> 35:02.532
(whirring)

35:04.368 --> 35:05.535
Stapler.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.471
You do it.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.573
It's been a while since I've
been below the belly button.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.444
(stapler clicking)

35:14.446 --> 35:16.346
So I guess we both were right,
huh?

35:16.348 --> 35:18.315
(click)

35:18.317 --> 35:19.850
(click)
(exhales)

35:19.852 --> 35:21.685
Can you clamp the mesentery?

35:21.687 --> 35:23.487
Clamp.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.692
(clicking)
clamped.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.260
How we doing?

35:30.262 --> 35:32.329
B.P.'s 80 and rising.
C.V.P. Is 10.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.697
Normal sinus rhythm.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.766
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:36.768 --> 35:38.535
Nice work.

35:45.610 --> 35:48.478
I'm insanely late for
this department head meeting.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.481
(clears throat)
you'll check in on him?
Of course.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.482
Listen, alex,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.184
This morning,
I was hard on you,

35:54.186 --> 35:55.619
'cause this is a hard job.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.488
And if you're gonna feel
every--
I will, dawn.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.757
Okay? That's just who I am.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.225
<i>(man speaking indistinctly)</i>

36:02.227 --> 36:05.162
Right. And I'm the bitch.

36:05.164 --> 36:06.563
I never said that.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.833
You don't need to.
I know what people think of me.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.302
"oh, dr. Bell.
She's such a hard-ass.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.571
I'm so afraid of dr. Bell."

36:14.573 --> 36:16.573
I'm not afraid of you,
dawn.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.208
You pulled the plug
on charlie,

36:18.210 --> 36:19.376
And I'm having a bit
of a difficult time

36:19.378 --> 36:22.312
Dealing with that.
Okay?

36:22.314 --> 36:23.914
And I'm having
a bit of a hard time

36:23.916 --> 36:26.683
Getting over charlie leaving me
for you.

36:26.685 --> 36:30.387
Okay. (clears throat)
you know, we don't...

36:30.389 --> 36:32.422
We don't need to do this.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.491
(chuckles)

36:34.493 --> 36:36.626
Maybe I'm just incapable
of being happy, right?

36:36.628 --> 36:40.664
That's why I kept
that stupid lobster.

36:41.766 --> 36:43.934
That time at peggy's cove,

36:43.936 --> 36:46.770
My time with charlie...

36:46.772 --> 36:50.207
I think that's the closest
I've ever come.

36:52.410 --> 36:55.312
Do you still love him?

37:00.251 --> 37:03.420
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:06.290 --> 37:08.358
There were some
considerable complications

37:08.360 --> 37:10.293
During your surgery.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.662
You were very lucky.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.863
Funny.

37:13.865 --> 37:16.433
I don't feel so lucky.

37:16.435 --> 37:20.637
We were able to fix
your heart valve.

37:20.639 --> 37:23.273
But?

37:23.275 --> 37:26.009
You have an advanced
colon cancer, sam.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.844
(siren wailing in distance)

37:27.846 --> 37:29.412
What are my odds?

37:29.414 --> 37:32.682
Survival rates vary.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.351
That bad, huh?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.453
You should get some rest.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.455
Yeah.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.690
(whispers) maybe I should
take a trip to boca.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.392
(chuckles)

37:42.394 --> 37:44.294
Now that sounds like a plan.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.296
And then
when you're strong enough,

37:46.298 --> 37:48.798
I'll talk about
a treatment path.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.000
Chemo?

37:50.002 --> 37:51.668
(inhales deeply)

37:51.670 --> 37:53.770
Mm. (sighs deeply)

37:53.772 --> 37:55.972
You know,

37:55.974 --> 37:58.775
When hannah lost
all her hair,

37:58.777 --> 38:02.479
I went to this, uh,
hasidic wig shop.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.547
Bought her one of each kind.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.850
So you could be with
a different woman every night?

38:06.852 --> 38:09.019
You got my number.
(chuckles)

38:09.021 --> 38:11.655
I do.

38:11.657 --> 38:15.959
You know, uh, I've been thinking
about you and dr. Bell.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.560
I'm sure you have.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.562
Not like that.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.930
Although...

38:20.932 --> 38:24.334
(laughs)

38:30.007 --> 38:31.808
You know, doc,

38:31.810 --> 38:34.010
No one can make you feel
like a schmuck

38:34.012 --> 38:36.780
Without your consent.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.684
(pats hand)

38:40.686 --> 38:42.786
It's called f.O.P.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.921
Fibrodysplasia
ossificans progressiva.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.656
It's extremely rare. Um...

38:46.658 --> 38:51.428
I mean, worldwide,
there are maybe... 800 cases.
800?

38:51.430 --> 38:53.897
Yeah. The body reacts to trauma
by ossifying.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.732
Essentially,
that means that it...

38:55.734 --> 38:57.534
Grows a second skeleton.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.935
That would be why, uh,

38:58.937 --> 39:00.570
Emma couldn't raise her arm
after the biopsy.

39:00.572 --> 39:01.805
You can operate, though?

39:01.807 --> 39:03.073
No. I can't.

39:03.075 --> 39:04.974
Actually, um,
the thing with f.O.P. Is

39:04.976 --> 39:06.943
That's the worst thing
that you could do.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.978
As I said before,
the body reacts to the trauma

39:08.980 --> 39:10.747
By growing more bone.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.616
So if I had gone ahead
with the surgery,

39:13.618 --> 39:16.686
I literally would've taken years
off her life.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.088
(sighs)

39:18.090 --> 39:21.024
This disease is usually
discovered earlier in childhood,

39:21.026 --> 39:23.593
But, you see, emma hasn't had
that many attacks. And...

39:23.595 --> 39:26.463
Well, we--she hasn't told us
about any.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.998
(sighs)

39:29.000 --> 39:32.035
That is because she's been
protecting you.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.673
Look, it's--it's obvious to me
how much you love your daughter.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.876
And I-I'm not gonna stand here
and tell you how to feel.

39:39.878 --> 39:43.913
But children have
an unbelievable capacity

39:43.915 --> 39:45.949
To just adapt.

39:45.951 --> 39:49.018
And sometimes,
diseases like this, they...

39:49.020 --> 39:51.388
Are more difficult
for the parents.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.822
Okay?

39:52.824 --> 39:55.492
She needs you now.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.029
Okay.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.465
(whispers) I wanna see her.

40:02.467 --> 40:04.401
(normal voice) I wanna--
I wanna see her.

40:04.403 --> 40:06.069
Of course.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.437
Come on.

40:14.879 --> 40:18.047
(daughter's "medicine" playing)

40:21.719 --> 40:24.053
(speaks indistinctly)

40:24.055 --> 40:26.656
...A really big secret
for a long time.

40:26.658 --> 40:30.093
It's something you don't have
to do anymore, okay?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.162
¶ pick it up
okay?

40:32.164 --> 40:34.731
So you don't have to
hold on to this anymore.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.065
You don't have to
keep secrets.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.901
You don't have to fight this
alone.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.670
You're gonna fight

40:40.672 --> 40:43.206
With your mom and dad.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.774
You don't have to be
a tough guy. Okay?

40:44.776 --> 40:46.509
¶ you've got a second chance

40:46.511 --> 40:48.545
¶ you could go home

40:48.547 --> 40:49.946
¶ escape it all

40:49.948 --> 40:51.681
(crying)

40:51.683 --> 40:54.551
¶ it's just irrelevant

40:58.122 --> 41:01.758
¶ it's just medicine

41:06.063 --> 41:09.999
¶ it's just medicine

41:14.972 --> 41:19.542
¶ you could still be
what you want to ¶

41:19.544 --> 41:21.978
¶ what you said you were

41:21.980 --> 41:25.014
¶ when I met you

41:30.821 --> 41:32.722
¶ you've got a warm heart

41:32.724 --> 41:34.691
¶ you've got a beautiful brain

41:34.693 --> 41:35.692
Hello.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.728
¶ but it's disintegrating

41:38.730 --> 41:41.998
Are you the ortho hunk
everyone's talking about?

41:42.000 --> 41:44.868
The one who woke a guy up
with a misplaced screw?

41:44.870 --> 41:47.737
Um... What if I am?

41:47.739 --> 41:49.005
Well,
scrub nurses are saying

41:49.007 --> 41:50.773
They've never seen anything
like it.

41:50.775 --> 41:54.077
I'm just making up
for lost time.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.979
Well, don't get smug.

41:55.981 --> 41:57.547
I'm not smug.

41:57.549 --> 41:58.948
I'm just saying,

41:58.950 --> 42:01.551
You're not the only person
who saved a life today.

42:01.553 --> 42:02.819
What?

42:02.821 --> 42:05.889
Turns out I was right
about the colon.

42:07.124 --> 42:08.758
That's my girl.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.660
Thank you.

42:12.796 --> 42:14.030
Charlie...

42:14.032 --> 42:15.198
(groans)

42:15.200 --> 42:17.667
Mm. About peggy's cove...

42:17.669 --> 42:19.936
Yeah. (sighs)
yeah.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.571
(lobster clatters)

42:21.573 --> 42:24.107
I don't care.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.543
I don't care about dawn.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.545
You shouldn't care
about joel.

42:30.581 --> 42:32.148
I don't.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.883
Good.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.286
'cause this is all
that matters,

42:36.288 --> 42:38.555
Right here.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.956
Me and you.

42:39.958 --> 42:43.026
¶ when I met you

42:43.028 --> 42:44.060
¶ when you met me

42:44.062 --> 42:47.030
And I'm good,
as long as you stay.

42:47.032 --> 42:48.164
¶ met you

42:48.166 --> 42:51.167
Vertical and upright?
Nope.

42:51.169 --> 42:52.969
<i>Oh,</i> my...

42:52.971 --> 42:54.137
Goodness.

42:54.139 --> 42:56.005
Oh, my.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.273
¶ ohh

42:57.275 --> 42:58.675
Ohh.

42:58.677 --> 43:00.310
¶ ooh-ooh, ohh

43:00.312 --> 43:01.778

43:01.780 --> 43:04.113

43:04.115 --> 43:07.984
¶ medicine

43:07.986 --> 43:10.987
¶ medicine
