WEBVTT

00:06.407 --> 00:09.577
- Charlie: READ IT, HANNAH.
- PLEASE, NO.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.745
- HANNAH, JUST READ IT.
- MARNIE DOESN'T WANT ME
TO READ IT.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.181
JUST READ IT.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.649
I NEED TO HEAR THE HONESTY
IN YOUR VOICE, JUST READ IT.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.158
"MARNIE HAS TO STOP WHINING
AND BREAK UP WITH HIM ALREADY.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.826
OF COURSE IT
WILL BE PAINFUL,

00:25.926 --> 00:27.461
- BUT SHE'S ALREADY
IN SO MUCH AGONY...
- ( sighs )

00:27.561 --> 00:30.531
STUCK IN A PRISON
OF HIS KINDNESS."

00:30.631 --> 00:33.601
- THAT'S NOT
NECESSARILY A BAD--
- JUST FINISH, JUST FINISH.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.470
"JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE IS KIND
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE RIGHT.

00:36.570 --> 00:39.107
BETTER TO END IT NOW,
CUT OFF THE LIMB,

00:39.207 --> 00:41.342
AND LET THE STUMP HEAL.
HE'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE,

00:41.442 --> 00:43.644
SOMEONE WHO APPRECIATES HIS
KIND OF SMOTHERING LOVE."

00:43.744 --> 00:46.414
OH, NICE.

00:46.514 --> 00:48.849
OKAY, I WISH
I NEVER FOUND IT.

00:48.949 --> 00:52.120
I DO. I SWEAR.
I WISH I NEVER FOUND
IT, BUT I DID.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.621
YOU KNOW?
I DID.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.124
THAT IS NOT MY JOURNAL.
THOSE AREN'T MY FEELINGS.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.958
NO, THEY'RE HANNAH'S
FEELINGS ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.593
NO, HANNAH KNOWS NOTHING.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.163
IT IS A JOURNAL!
WHY WOULD SHE LIE
IN THE JOURNAL?!

01:02.263 --> 01:04.165
THAT IS THE POINT,
IS NOT TO LIE!

01:05.699 --> 01:07.335
OKAY, I DON'T WANT
TO SPLIT HAIRS HERE,

01:07.435 --> 01:09.103
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT
A JOURNAL, IT'S A NOTEBOOK.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.671
IT'S NOTES FOR A BOOK.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.440
OH, SO YOU WANT
THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD

01:12.540 --> 01:15.376
TO HEAR ALL YOUR VALUABLE
THOUGHTS ABOUT MY RELATIONSHIP?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.010
NO, I'M JUST SAYING THAT
I FEEL THAT "JOURNAL" IMPLIES

01:17.111 --> 01:18.879
LIKE, A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHO RIDES HORSES

01:18.979 --> 01:21.182
AND IS OBSESSED WITH HER MOM.
IT'S NOT WHAT I'M DOING.

01:21.282 --> 01:24.252
IT'S NOT YOURS
TO WRITE ABOUT, HANNAH.
IT'S MY LIFE.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.421
OKAY, I DESERVE
HONESTY AND RESPECT

01:27.521 --> 01:30.858
BECAUSE I AM AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THIS COMMUNITY.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.326
WHAT COMMUNITY?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.229
THE FUCKING COMMUNITY
OF THIS APARTMENT.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.265
- YOU ARE.
- YOU DON'T PAY RENT.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.732
OH, SHUT UP.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:38.832 --> 01:41.169
I WOULDN'T EVEN WANT
TO STAY HERE IF I WANTED TO.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.137
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO NOT HAVE ME HERE?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.538
- THAT'S WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
- HOLY SHIT!

01:44.638 --> 01:46.807
- THAT'S WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
- OH, MY GOD!

01:46.907 --> 01:48.842
- OKAY, I BUILT THIS.
I BUILT THIS FUCKING THING.
- YOU'RE BEING CRAZY.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.644
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
YOU DO RIGHT BEFORE YOU
HIT US. DON'T HIT US!

01:50.744 --> 01:53.414
- YOU'RE A DICK. SO ARE YOU.
- CHARLIE! COME BACK.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.082
- YOU GUYS ARE FUCKING DICKS.
- YOU REALLY HURT ME.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.918
- MY ANKLE KNOB AND MY KNEE!
- OH, FUCK YOU!

01:58.018 --> 02:00.621
Marnie:
I DID NOTHING WRONG!
I DIDN'T WRITE IT!

02:00.721 --> 02:02.290
Charlie:
OH, THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S SO TRUE.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.891
DIDN'T FUCKING WRITE IT.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.465
- HEY, MARNIE?
- WHAT?

02:11.565 --> 02:14.001
IF YOU HAD READ THE ESSAY
AND IT WASN'T ABOUT YOU,

02:14.101 --> 02:15.869
DO YOU THINK YOU
WOULD'VE LIKED IT?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.505
JUST AS, LIKE,
A PIECE OF WRITING.

02:25.145 --> 02:29.583
( theme music playing )

02:30.218 --> 02:32.253
( slurps )

02:36.524 --> 02:38.058
( slurps )

02:38.158 --> 02:40.261
I'M GOING
TO GET HIM BACK.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.530
I'M GOING TO PUT ON MY PARTY
DRESS AND MY SORRY FACE,

02:42.630 --> 02:43.964
AND I'M GOING
TO GET HIM BACK.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.566
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.768
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
SEEM HAPPY WITH HIM.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.337
I'M DEFINITELY NOT HAPPY NOW.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.305
YOU'VE DONE REAL DAMAGE.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.073
OKAY, I DIDN'T LEAVE
MY NOTEBOOK OUT.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.942
HE WAS SNOOPING
THROUGH ALL MY STUFF.
THAT'S LIKE A CRIME.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.111
YOU SAID SOME REALLY,
REALLY MEAN THINGS ABOUT
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.448
BUT THEY WERE TRUE.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.250
MAYBE YOU JUST CAN'T SEE
THIS THAT CLEARLY

03:02.350 --> 03:04.285
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN LOVED THIS MUCH.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.622
EXCEPT BY ME.
I LOVE YOU THAT MUCH.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.224
RIGHT.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.961
AND YOUR DAD, OBVIOUSLY.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.896
AND YOUR BOSS.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.131
I HATE EVERYONE
WHO LOVES ME.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.501
HE TOUCHES MY BUTT,
CHASTITY, LESLEY...

03:20.601 --> 03:22.603
BUT, LIKE, MINE
KIND OF ESPECIALLY.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.672
AND THEN I'M 20 MINUTES
LATE, AND HE DOESN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.874
SO I'M NOT GONNA COMPLAIN
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.309
OKAY, BE HONEST.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.344
YOU'RE SORT OF FLATTERED
BY THE WHOLE THING.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.146
I'M NOT FLATTERED BY
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

03:33.247 --> 03:35.716
WHY NOT?
I LOVE THAT STUFF.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.686
"SIR, I HAVE HALF A MIND
TO CALL THE AUTHORITIES.
HOW DARE YOU?"

03:38.786 --> 03:40.120
( chuckles )

03:40.220 --> 03:41.589
YOU SHOULD HUMP HIM.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.191
THAT IS DISGUSTING.
I WOULD NEVER.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.227
HE WOULD LIKE THAT.
I WOULD NEVER. WHY?

03:47.328 --> 03:48.996
FOR THE STORY, HANNAH.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.732
WELL, I CAN'T FUCK ANYONE
'CAUSE I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.701
- WHO?
- ADAM.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.303
I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.037
HOW HE WAS TORTURING ME.
HOW SAD I WAS,

03:57.137 --> 03:58.372
AND HE RESPONDED
IN SUCH A LOVELY WAY.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.508
HE KISSED ME AND KISSED
ME AND KISSED ME

04:00.608 --> 04:02.042
AND HE SAID,
"BE WHO YOU ARE."

04:02.142 --> 04:03.711
AND HE TOUCHED MY FACE.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.979
AND, LIKE, WE'RE
BASICALLY TOGETHER NOW.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.681
RIGHT.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.651
WELL, GUYS LIKE THAT
WILL TRY ANYTHING ONCE.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.620
EVEN LOVE.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.169
WHAT COLOR'S THAT,
AQUAMARINE?

04:29.269 --> 04:32.239
- EGGSHELL BLUE.
- EGGSHELL BLUE?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.408
I LIKE THE WAY IT FINELY
CLASHES WITH YOUR MASCARA.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.510
IT JUST KIND OF
AGGRESSIVELY CLASHES.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.178
- RAY?
- JUST FINISHING UP
WITH A CUSTOMER HERE.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.181
JUST AGGRESSIVELY
JUST CLASHING.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.484
BANG, BANG, BANG.
YOU HAVE BANGS, TOO.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.354
- ALL RIGHT, LET ME
KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.
- RAY.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.888
I HOPE TO GOD NO ONE THINKS
YOU'RE HERE TO SEE ME.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.890
I AM HERE TO SEE YOU.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.192
LOOK, I GET YOU, OKAY?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.161
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE ABOUT,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.597
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
- I DON'T LIKE IT, OKAY?

04:56.697 --> 05:00.133
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU
ASS-FUCK MY BEST FRIEND
IN THE HEART.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.802
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.672
- CHARLIE'S A GOOD GUY, OKAY?
- I KNOW.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.208
HE'S NOT SOME DICKHOLE
FOR YOU TO TOY AROUND WITH.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.677
ARE YOU, LIKE,
IN LOVE WITH HIM?

05:09.777 --> 05:12.446
MORE THAN YOU ARE.
YEAH, MAYBE I AM. OKAY?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.081
AND THE LAST THING HE NEEDS
IS MORE ABUSE FROM YOU.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.583
- I KNOW.
- YOU KNOW?

05:15.683 --> 05:17.117
YES.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.252
IF YOU KNOW,
THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE
YOU DOING HERE RIGHT NOW?

05:19.353 --> 05:22.289
- I NEED HIS ADDRESS.
- YOU'VE NEVER--

05:22.390 --> 05:23.891
BEEN TO HIS APARTMENT, NO.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.894
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO
HIS APARTMENT, OKAY?
SO I NEED HIS ADDRESS.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.432
- COME ON, RAY.
- DON'T, DON'T GESTURE
LIKE THAT.

05:31.532 --> 05:34.101
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.569
I'M ONLY WRITING THIS DOWN
BECAUSE IT'S STARTING TO SMELL

05:35.669 --> 05:36.937
LIKE A BATH & BODY WORKS
IN HERE.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.706
TYPICALLY I'D ASK FOR
A BLOWJOB OR SOMETHING,

05:38.806 --> 05:40.841
BUT I DON'T WANT TO
HATE-FUCK YOU.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.576
IT'S THAT REAL.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.913
YOU SHRINK ME UP,
BALLS RIGHT IN MY STOMACH.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.515
WHAT?

05:50.984 --> 05:53.521
GOOD WORK,
KEEP IT UP.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.357
CHASTITY, SWEETHEART,
WOULD YOU SHOW HANNAH

05:57.458 --> 06:00.394
HOW TO BREAK DOWN
A FREAKIN' BOX?

06:16.444 --> 06:18.612
( buzzing )

06:21.482 --> 06:25.453
- YOU DID ALL OF THIS?
- YEAH.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.355
I MEAN, RAY HELPED.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.158
I AM SO IMPRESSED.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.594
SERIOUSLY, IT LOOKS
AWESOME IN HERE.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.996
IT'S LIKE A TARGET AD.
PERFECT.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.898
- A TARGET AD?
- YEAH.

06:37.998 --> 06:39.900
EVERYTHING HAS A PLACE.
IT'S AWESOME.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.335
YEAH, I KNOW.
I THINK IT CAME OUT
PRETTY GOOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.337
IT'S NOT QUITE
TARGET AD BUT...

06:44.438 --> 06:46.940
WHATEVER.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.611
I KEPT TELLING YOU.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.312
I KEPT TELLING YOU
TO COME OVER.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.948
YOU NEVER TOLD ME
TO COME OVER HERE.

06:55.048 --> 06:59.052
I DID. I TOLD YOU
A BUNCH OF TIMES...

06:59.152 --> 07:00.888
AND THEN I STOPPED.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.423
WELL, IT'S NOT EXACTLY
EASY FOR ME TO GET HERE
FROM WORK, SO...

07:03.524 --> 07:06.494
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
I TAKE THE BUS
TO THE TRAIN.

07:06.594 --> 07:10.330
YEAH, WELL, YOU NEVER
SLEEP HERE.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.833
- SO...
- WELL, I WILL NOW.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.338
Jeff:
SO, WE'LL BE BACK
AROUND 7:00,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.340
BUT IF WE'RE LATE,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.576
JUST ORDER PIZZA
OR SOME TAKEOUT...

07:23.711 --> 07:26.446
WHOA, YOU LOOK FANCY.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.915
I'M GOING OUT,

07:28.015 --> 07:29.983
BUT I WILL BE BACK IN
TIME FOR THE CHILDREN.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.285
OKAY, WHERE YOU GOING?

07:32.385 --> 07:35.823
TO MEET A FRIEND
FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.357
BOYFRIEND?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.427
WELL, HE WAS, BUT...

07:40.528 --> 07:43.564
ACTUALLY, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHY HE WANTS TO SEE
ME, HE DUMPED ME.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.634
- HA! SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.336
I KNOW, IT'S EMBARRASSING.
WHAT? YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN DUMPED?

07:49.436 --> 07:52.072
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I ALWAYS GOT DUMPED.
I NEVER DUMPED A GIRL.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.473
OKAY, YOU'RE LYING.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.809
YEAH, I'M LYING BECAUSE
I WANT TO SOUND SO COOL.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.612
Katherine:
SO THOSE KEYS DID NOT WORK
TO THE STORAGE UNIT,

07:58.712 --> 08:02.583
SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO BUY NEW BOOGIE BOARDS.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.953
- HI, EVERYONE.
- HI.

08:07.755 --> 08:11.024
SO THIS IS
WHERE THE PARTY'S AT.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.359
( all chuckling )

08:12.459 --> 08:14.862
- I'M ACTUALLY JUST LEAVING.
- OH.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.830
JESSA, IS THAT
KATHERINE'S LIPSTICK?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.332
OH, DON'T BE
A TATTLETALE, JEFF.

08:19.432 --> 08:23.003
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.
I HAVE LIKE 15 FROM GIFT BAGS.
THEY'RE FREE, SO...

08:23.103 --> 08:25.906
YEAH, OKAY, WELL...

08:26.006 --> 08:27.240
I'M LEAVING.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.243
OH, WHERE ARE YOU--
OH.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.813
- SEE YOU, JEFF.
- YEAH. SEE YOU.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.484
LOOK, WE'RE NOT GROWN-UPS.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.720
WE DON'T HAVE KIDS.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.355
- WE DON'T SHARE A HOUSE.
- BUT I LOVE YOUR HOUSE.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.992
THERE'S NOTHING
KEEPING US TOGETHER

08:45.092 --> 08:48.562
OTHER THAN THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE ALREADY
BEEN TOGETHER FOR SO LONG.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.732
LOOK...

08:54.001 --> 08:55.035
I'M...

08:55.135 --> 08:57.638
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THERE
IS LEFT TO SAY.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.909
YOU'RE NOT IN LOVE
WITH ME ANYMORE.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.749
( music playing )

09:08.849 --> 09:10.283
JUST BREATHE, OKAY?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.920
- JUST BREATHE.
ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'M BREATHING.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.055
I CAN'T MOVE.
I'M STUCK TO THIS POLE.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.424
WHAT DID YOU EAT?
WHAT DID YOU DRINK?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.627
I DON'T KNOW, SOME GUY.
HIM, THAT GUY.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.329
- WHAT ARE THOSE?
- POT BROWNIES.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.497
- WHAT'S ON THEM?
- JELL-O SHOTS.

09:24.598 --> 09:28.201
- IS THE MUSIC GOING
LIKE-- WAH, WAH, WAH?
- YES, YES, YES.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.804
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR
HEART'S GOING TO JUST FALL
OUT THROUGH YOUR VAGINA?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.540
MAYBE, I DO.
I DON'T-- YEAH.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.275
OH, MY GOD.
I WANT ONE.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.945
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
I'M GONNA BE HERE WITH YOU.

09:38.045 --> 09:41.114
- I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.
- THANK YOU, I REALLY
APPRECIATE THIS.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.717
- HANNAH, HANNAH,
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
- HI! HI!

09:43.817 --> 09:45.585
YOU DID YOUR MAKEUP
LIKE I TOLD YOU TO.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.554

09:47.655 --> 09:50.457
OH, MY GOD, MARNIE'S
STUCK TO THIS POLE.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.792
WHY ARE YOU STUCK
TO A POLE?

09:51.892 --> 09:53.526
I CAN'T MOVE.
I'M VERY SCARED.

09:53.627 --> 09:56.596
- ( new song plays )
- OH, MY GOD!

09:56.697 --> 09:59.833
Both:
SCISSOR SISTERS!

09:59.933 --> 10:02.102
- NO, I CAN'T.
SHE'S STUCK TO THE POLE.
- SHE'S STUCK TO A POLE?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.537
WILL YOU BE OKAY
FOR FIVE MINUTES?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.506
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE.
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.976
- Elijah: YOU'RE FINE.
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.079
- I JUST WANT TO DANCE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.
- CHARLIE, CHARLIE.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.247
CAN YOU DANCE LATER?

10:14.347 --> 10:17.584
WATCH THIS GIRL WHILE
I GO FUCK MY GIRLFRIEND.
( laughs )

10:17.685 --> 10:19.820
- I'M NOT OKAY.
- MARNIE, CHARLIE.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.354
CHARLIE, JUST WATCH HER.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.857
( sighs )

10:24.758 --> 10:27.795
- HI. HI.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.732
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:31.832 --> 10:35.035
- HUH?
- I ATE SOMETHING,
AND I'M SCARED NOW.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.337
OH, DO YOU WANT SOMETHING?
YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU
WATER OR FOOD?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.240
- I DON'T THINK THERE'S FOOD,
BUT I CAN GET YOU SOME.
- CAN YOU GIVE ME A HUG?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.976
A HUG? LIKE A HUG?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.444
UH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.446

10:54.121 --> 10:55.622
THANK YOU.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.426
HEY, IF YOU'RE FEELING
BETTER IN LIKE AN HOUR,

10:59.526 --> 11:02.229
MY BAND IS PLAYING
RIGHT NEXT DOOR IF
YOU WANNA COME.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.898
COULD YOU HUG ME AGAIN?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.334
YEAH.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.769
( Charlie laughs )
YEAH.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.670
YOU HAD THESE BANGS
AND THAT HEADBAND.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.373
AND I SWEAR TO GOD YOU
LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THIS GIRL

11:13.473 --> 11:14.808
THAT I SAW IN THIS PORN.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.676
IT WAS CALLED
"SOPHOMORE SLUTS,"

11:16.777 --> 11:18.545
AND I LITERALLY
THAT NIGHT WENT BACK

11:18.645 --> 11:20.513
JUST TO CHECK IT OUT
'CAUSE I SWEAR IT WAS YOU.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.783
YOU WATCH PORN?

11:22.883 --> 11:25.485
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

11:25.585 --> 11:28.155
WHY DON'T YOU JUST,
LIKE...

11:28.255 --> 11:31.792
PICTURE US HAVING SEX?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.628
- I CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

11:35.729 --> 11:38.999
BECAUSE THAT MAKES ME SADDER.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.280
THE FILES YOU
REQUESTED, RICH.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.250
OH, THANKS, HON.
JUST PLOP THEM ON
THE DESK THERE.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.887
- PLOP.
- ( chuckles )

11:59.987 --> 12:01.588
OH, I'M GONNA WORK
THROUGH LUNCH.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.090
CAN I SEND YOU OUT
FOR A SANDWICH?

12:03.190 --> 12:05.225
- YEAH, OF COURSE YOU CAN.
- THANKS.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.394
YOU CAN SEND ME ANYWHERE,
ANYTIME. IT'S MY JOB.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.896
GREAT, SO FOR A SANDWICH.

12:08.996 --> 12:12.365
TURKEY, RYE,
RUSSIAN DRESSING.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.768
NO TOMATO, THOUGH.
I DON'T--

12:14.868 --> 12:16.703
BE HONEST WITH ME, RICH.

12:16.804 --> 12:19.606
OKAY, DROP
THE SANDWICH STUFF.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.575
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO FUCK ME.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.612
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO TELL SINCE
I FIRST STARTED WORKING HERE.

12:25.712 --> 12:29.349
AND AT FIRST
IT WAS REPULSIVE TO ME,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.718
BUT NOW I'M GAME.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.821
SO I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST DO THIS

12:33.921 --> 12:36.323
BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.494
I'M A MARRIED MAN,
HANNAH.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.263
I'VE GOT A BOYFRIEND.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.932
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ADULTS TRY THINGS.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE LEARNED.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.334
WE WORK TOGETHER.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.103
THIS IS AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY
TO TALK TO YOUR EMPLOYER.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.972
RICH, YOU DON'T
NEED TO FIGHT IT.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.907
I'M NOT, LIKE,
TRYING TO FRAME YOU.

12:54.007 --> 12:57.878
I AM LETTING YOU KNOW
THAT IT IS OKAY FOR YOU
TO ACT ON THIS FANTASY

12:57.978 --> 13:00.480
BECAUSE I AM GROSS...

13:00.580 --> 13:03.116
AND SO ARE YOU.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.822
( laughing )

13:12.159 --> 13:14.627
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT?

13:14.727 --> 13:16.263
( laughing )

13:17.931 --> 13:20.533
- WHAT IS FUNNY?
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.336
I'M, LIKE, MAKING
YOUR FANTASIES COME TRUE.
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

13:23.436 --> 13:25.973
NO, NO, IT'S JUST--
I MEAN, WHAT'S GOING ON

13:26.073 --> 13:27.707

13:27.807 --> 13:30.077
WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT

WANTED TO FUCK ME,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.678
SO I SAID YOU
COULD FUCK ME.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.046
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
NO, I NEVER--

13:33.146 --> 13:35.048
I NEVER-- NO, NO.
PLEASE--

13:35.148 --> 13:36.917

13:37.017 --> 13:40.553

13:40.653 --> 13:42.455
I COULD SUE YOU,
YOU KNOW.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.426
- EXCUSE ME?
- I COULD SUE YOU.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.995

HANNAH, YOU BARELY

13:58.371 --> 14:01.341
TO GET TO WORK AT 10:00 A.M.,
LET ALONE SUE SOMEBODY.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.610
THERE'S NO SUING APP
ON YOUR iPHONE.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.412
INSULT ME,
THAT'S FINE.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.948
I'M QUITTING THIS JOB,
AND IT'S FOR SEXUAL REASONS.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.150
SO WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ME
A CHECK FOR 1,000 BUCKS...

14:10.250 --> 14:13.954
- AND I DROP THE LAWSUIT.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.622
I'M SORRY.
NO, HANNAH.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.657
- PLEASE.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.360
LISTEN,
PLEASE DON'T QUIT.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.262
WE CAN GET PAST THIS.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.631
- YOU WANT TO GET PAST THIS?
- YEAH.

14:24.731 --> 14:29.036
I JUST TRIED TO FUCK YOU,
SUE YOU, AND EXTORT YOU.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.104
I'M FUCKING NUTS.
WHY WOULD YOU WANT ME
IN YOUR OFFICE?

14:31.204 --> 14:32.772
BECAUSE YOU'RE GREAT.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.576
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO
ANYTHING, BUT YOU HAVE
SO MUCH POTENTIAL.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.379
THINK ABOUT IT.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.253
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE NOT
MY DAD OR MY BOYFRIEND.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.089
HANNAH.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.391
AND SOMEDAY, I'M GOING TO

14:54.962 --> 14:56.964
AND THEN YOU
CAN SUE ME.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.099
( door closes )

14:59.199 --> 15:01.634

15:01.734 --> 15:03.136
WHY?

15:03.236 --> 15:06.073
- YOU DON'T LOVE ME.
- I REALLY LOVE YOU.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.175
YOU'RE NOT
IN LOVE WITH ME.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.243
WELL, ARE YOU
IN LOVE WITH ME?

15:10.343 --> 15:12.345
- I DON'T CARE.
- HOW CAN YOU NOT CARE?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.514
BECAUSE I DECIDED ON YOU.
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

15:14.614 --> 15:15.983
I DECIDED ON YOU.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.817
I DON'T WANT TO GO

THRILLED AND THEN...

15:20.887 --> 15:22.855

15:22.956 --> 15:24.157
I LIKE THE SMELL
OF YOUR HAIR

15:24.257 --> 15:25.858
AND I LIKE THE SOUND
OF YOUR VOICE

15:25.959 --> 15:27.827
- AND I FUCKING
DECIDED ON YOU.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.030
AH!

15:31.064 --> 15:33.000
PLEASE, DON'T
BREAK UP WITH ME.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.768
PLEASE DON'T,
JUST DON'T.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.870
I'LL DO WHATEVER

15:37.971 --> 15:39.639
I WILL...

15:39.739 --> 15:41.641
I'LL KICK HANNAH OUT.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.343
I CAN EVEN MOVE IN HERE.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.945
I'LL ANSWER YOUR
SISTER'S I.M.s.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.381
DO YOU WANT BLOWJOBS?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017

JUST TO SAY HELLO.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.038

16:11.138 --> 16:13.406
ARE YOU STALKING ME?

16:13.506 --> 16:16.209
( chuckles )
WE ARE NOT GOING

16:16.309 --> 16:20.080
OH, NO. WE ARE NOT
GOING TO HAVE SEX.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.482
OKAY, I'M REALLY SERIOUS.
I'VE BEEN WITH GILLIAN

16:22.582 --> 16:25.118

16:25.218 --> 16:27.187
SO YOUR WHOLE SEXY
GEISHA OUTFIT--

16:27.287 --> 16:29.856
YOU ARE?
THAT'S A CRAZY
THING TO DO.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.358
WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S 38 YEARS OLD.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.992
SHE'S ACTUALLY
READY FOR A MATURE
RELATIONSHIP, UNLIKE--

16:33.093 --> 16:34.961
SHE'S 38?

16:35.062 --> 16:38.265
SHE'S OLD,
LIKE A MOM.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.802
- SHE'S A PUBLISHER.
- OF WHAT? BOOKS?

16:42.902 --> 16:45.072
YEAH, BOOKS.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.874
SHE HAS A SMALL PRESS.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.777
HAVE YOU EVER
LOOKED INTO THAT?

16:50.877 --> 16:53.113
'CAUSE SHE COULD
JUST BE, LIKE,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.315
RUNNING OFF COPIES
AT KINKO'S

16:55.415 --> 16:57.750
AND SAYING THAT
SHE HAS A PRESS.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.352
AND WHO'S TO SAY
SHE ACTUALLY HAS ONE?

16:59.452 --> 17:02.289
- ARE YOU JEALOUS?

BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE YOU.
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE

17:10.463 --> 17:12.232
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH MY OLD FRIEND.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.535
A GIRL THAT I USED TO DATE IN
A VERY TUMULTUOUS RELATIONSHIP

17:15.635 --> 17:18.405
IN WHICH ONE'S VESPA
GETS DESTROYED FOR
NO REASON, GETS...

17:18.505 --> 17:19.872
- I DID YOU A FAVOR.
- ...ROLLED OFF A DOCK.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.741
( laughs )

17:21.840 --> 17:23.742
SEE, YOU'RE LAUGHING.
I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.
BUT THAT'S FINE.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.113
I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I--
I THINK YOU'RE SPECIAL.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.446
I THINK YOU'RE GREAT.
I THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.682
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL MIND,
A BEAUTIFUL...

I JUST--

17:32.452 --> 17:35.455

17:41.994 --> 17:43.596
- REALLY.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.665
REALLY.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.135
REALLY?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.473
( moaning )

17:58.378 --> 18:00.647
- JESSA, JESSA.
- ( laughs )

18:10.056 --> 18:12.359
( both moaning )

18:22.235 --> 18:24.237
( moans loudly )

18:25.572 --> 18:28.007
( both groan )

18:28.107 --> 18:30.743
( breathing heavily )

18:45.124 --> 18:47.327
WHAT ABOUT GILLIAN?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.768
( door opens, closes )

18:55.868 --> 18:57.770
( snickers )

18:59.672 --> 19:00.840
OH, MY GOD.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.243
OH, MY GOD, SHOSHANNA.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.978
YOU'RE A BATSHIT
LITTLE PERV.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.816
I KNEW YOU WERE CRAZY,
BUT FUCKING PERV?!

19:09.916 --> 19:11.651
OH, MY GOD!

19:11.751 --> 19:14.721
OKAY, SO JUST SO YOU
KNOW WHAT YOU JUST SAW,

19:14.821 --> 19:18.825
THAT WAS ME SHOWING THAT
I CANNOT BE SMOTED.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.428
I AM UNSMOTABLE.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.897
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
WRITE THAT DOWN BY THE WAY.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.799
( whimpers )

19:33.973 --> 19:35.708
( knocks )

19:35.808 --> 19:38.311
FUCKER.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.849
- YO, KID.
- HEY, GROWN-UP.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.585
YOU NEED TO TELL ME NEXT TIME
YOU'RE ROLLING THROUGH.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.220
I'M KIND OF IN
THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.257
I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT
I ACTUALLY JUST QUIT MY JOB.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.658
DIDN'T YOU ALREADY
QUIT YOUR JOB?

19:51.758 --> 19:54.661
THIS IS A DIFFERENT JOB
THAN THE OTHER ONE I QUIT,

19:54.761 --> 19:57.530
AND I DID IT BECAUSE
THERE WAS A SEX SCANDAL
IN MY OFFICE.

19:59.266 --> 20:00.867
SOMETIMES YOU SAY SHIT
THAT SOUNDS MADE UP.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.535
I NEVER MAKE THINGS UP.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.971
YEAH, WELL, THEN EVERYTHING
BAD HAPPENS TO YOU.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.274
MIGHT NEED TO FACE UP
TO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
JUST NOT MEANT FOR A JOB

20:07.374 --> 20:09.242
IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.544
HE HAS OTHER PLANS
FOR YOU AND I.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.115
LIKE WHAT KINDA PLANS?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.286
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:19.386 --> 20:22.121
( chuckles )
WHAT DOES IT LOOK
LIKE I'M DOING?

20:22.221 --> 20:25.024
- YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
- WHY?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.159
BECAUSE WE LIKE...

20:27.260 --> 20:30.497
SAID WE WOULDN'T...
OR WHATEVER.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.667
- WE DID?
- YEAH, YOU DID.

20:34.767 --> 20:38.638
- WHEN DID I SAY THAT?
- YESTERDAY.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.308
YOU TOLD ME
EVERYTHING YOU WANT
OUT OF A RELATIONSHIP

20:41.408 --> 20:43.410
AND ALL THE WAYS
I WAS FUCKING YOU UP.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.545
YOU TOLD ME TO LOSE YOUR
NUMBER TILL CHRISTMAS.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.515
- YEAH, BUT THEN
YOU KISSED ME.
- YOU LOOKED SAD.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.484
- THEN WE HAD SEX.
- BECAUSE WE WERE KISSING.

20:53.386 --> 20:54.787
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.756
THESE THINGS HAVE
AN EXPIRATION DATE, OKAY?

20:56.856 --> 21:00.327
SIX MONTHS OR UNTIL
SOMEONE STOPS HAVING FUN.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.094
- BUT I'M HAVING FUN.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.365
YOU'RE LIKE ALL
SECRETLY SAD.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.567
AND THAT'S NOT COOL FOR YOU
AND IT'S NOT FUN FOR ME.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.169
IT'S A BUMMER, BUT PEOPLE
DO OUTGROW EACH OTHER.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.372
YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO OUTGROW EACH OTHER.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.741
WELL, THAT'S ON YOU, KID.
'CAUSE I'M DONE GROWING.

21:18.345 --> 21:19.812
I'M GONNA USE
YOUR BATHROOM.

21:19.912 --> 21:22.281
OKAY.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.686
ALSO, I ALMOST HAD SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE TODAY.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.222
OKAY.
WHAT? WHO?

21:30.323 --> 21:32.592
MY BOSS.
MY FORMER BOSS.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.327
THAT'S THE SEX SCANDAL
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

21:34.427 --> 21:36.295
NO, BECAUSE
I DIDN'T DO IT.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.398
BUT I MAYBE THINK
I WOULD HAVE.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.933
( stammers )
IS HE HOT?

21:41.033 --> 21:43.269
NO, HE'S NOT HOT.
HE'S LIKE 100 YEARS OLD.

21:43.370 --> 21:47.440
- WHY THEN?
- FOR THE STORY.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.410
I DON'T KNOW,
JUST TO BE AN ASSHOLE.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.648
( scoffs )

22:25.545 --> 22:28.881
YOU CAN'T DO--
HEY, YOU CAN'T DO
THIS TO ME ANYMORE.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.750
I WON'T.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.155
AND-- AND BE NICER
TO MY FRIENDS.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.390
OKAY, BUT JUST NOT RAY.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.826
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.528
OH, FUCK.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.196
- AND MARNIE.
- YEAH?

22:44.296 --> 22:47.066
ACT LIKE MY LIFE IS REAL.
YOU KNOW?

22:48.234 --> 22:49.436
'CAUSE MY LIFE IS REAL.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.203
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.439
- I HEAR YOU.
- OKAY.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.074
- ( kissing )
- OKAY.

22:55.174 --> 22:58.411
DOWN SHE GOES.
( chuckles )

23:00.346 --> 23:02.915
OKAY, I'M GOING.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.555
ADAM, I'M LEAVING.

23:09.656 --> 23:12.492
- ADAM?
- ( breathing heavily )

23:14.160 --> 23:18.264
OKAY, I'M STILL HERE.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.932
SO I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT
I WAS GONE ALREADY,

23:20.032 --> 23:22.401
- BUT I AM STILL HERE.
- NO, I KNOW.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.538
OKAY, I'M SORRY.
I'LL GO NOW.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.339
AND I'LL SEE YOU
WHEN I SEE YOU.

23:27.440 --> 23:31.110
DO YOU WANNA STAY
UNTIL I FINISH?

23:31.210 --> 23:34.614
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE STORY.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.586
OKAY.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.156
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.425
AND DON'T
ABANDON ME, OKAY?

23:46.526 --> 23:48.227
YOU KNOW, DON'T...

23:48.327 --> 23:51.063
- MAKE ME FEEL SAFE
AND THEN ABANDON ME.
- OKAY.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.265
THAT'S MY DAD.
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE
OF THAT IN MY LIFE.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.134
- OKAY, I REALLY CAN'T.
- OKAY.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.669
OKAY, COME HERE.
KISS ME, KISS ME.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.373
- KEEP YOUR FACE
CLOSE TO MINE.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.075
- KEEP YOUR FACE
CLOSE TO MINE.
- OKAY.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.144
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.379

24:09.448 --> 24:12.084
OKAY, STAY.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.722
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.959
- I CAN'T--
- OH!

24:20.059 --> 24:22.929
OH, SHH.
IT'S OKAY.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.430
- OW!
- IT'S OKAY.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.733
- OW.
- IT'S OKAY,
I'M RIGHT HERE.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.335
I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.939
OKAY, I'M RIGHT HERE.
( kissing )

24:33.039 --> 24:35.041
I'M RIGHT HERE.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.109
I WANT TO BREAK UP.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.751
( sighs )

24:46.653 --> 24:49.255
( breathing heavily )
DOES IT TURN YOU ON?

24:49.355 --> 24:51.691
TO WATCH ME TOUCH
MY OWN COCK?

24:52.224 --> 24:53.593
KIND OF, YEAH.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.796
OR DOES IT DISGUST YOU?
DO YOU THINK I'M REALLY BAD?

24:56.896 --> 24:59.398
NO, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE BAD.
I MEAN, EVERYONE DOES IT--

24:59.498 --> 25:01.801
DO YOU THINK I'M PATHETIC
AND DISGUSTING?

25:03.536 --> 25:05.004
YES, ACTUALLY.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.439
YOU DO, WHY?
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.809
BECAUSE THERE'S
A WOMAN STANDING LESS
THAN 10 FEET FROM YOU

25:09.909 --> 25:11.878
AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS PLAY
WITH YOUR OWN COCK.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.313
- IS IT BAD?
- IT'S REALLY BAD.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.782
IT'S PATHETIC AND BAD

25:15.882 --> 25:18.284
AND DISGUSTING
AND WEIRD AND LAZY.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.286
PLUS IF YOU HAVE A BIG COCK,
YOU SHOULD USE IT ON A WOMAN.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.221
- IT'S NOT THAT BIG.
- IT'S NOT?

25:22.321 --> 25:24.290
NO, MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO TOUCH IT.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.826
MAYBE YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT BIG.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.695
MAYBE.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.262
YOU LIKE THIS?
HAVING ME WATCH YOU?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.831
I DO. I LIKE IT.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.066
WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT IT?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.868
NO, PUT YOUR
SHIT DOWN.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.371
PUT IT DOWN.
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.941
( breathing heavily )

25:44.577 --> 25:46.345
I WANT CAB MONEY.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.681

25:48.781 --> 25:51.651

I WANT CAB MONEY.

25:51.751 --> 25:54.754
- HOW MUCH?

25:54.854 --> 25:57.389
30, BECAUSE I ALSO
WANT PIZZA AND GUM.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.526
WELL, I KEEP MY MONEY
IN MY DRAWER.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.729
OKAY.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.264
KEEP MY FUCKING
EYE ON YOU.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.102
- YOU ONLY HAVE HUNDREDS.
- FUCK!

26:10.202 --> 26:13.272
- AND I'M TAKING ONE.
- YOU ARE?

26:13.372 --> 26:14.841
YEAH, I AM.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.342
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T
TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY

26:16.442 --> 26:18.577
CONSIDERING YOU MADE ME
WATCH THIS ALL AFTERNOON.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.680
- I'M SORRY.
- ARE YOU SORRY?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.950
- YEAH, I'M SORRY.
- HOW SORRY?

26:24.050 --> 26:26.753
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- WHY DON'T YOU SAY
THAT TO ME AGAIN?

26:26.853 --> 26:29.856
- I'M SORRY!
- WHY DON'T YOU SAY THAT TO ME
AGAIN LIKE YOU MEAN IT?

26:29.956 --> 26:32.458
- I'M SORRY!
- YOU LIKE SAYING THAT.
SAY IT AGAIN.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.560
- I'M SORRY.
- SAY IT ONE MORE TIME!

26:34.661 --> 26:37.930
- I'M SORRY!
- THAT'S FINE.
JUST HURRY UP.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.232
DO YOU WANT TO STEP
ON MY BALLS?

26:40.332 --> 26:41.868
ARE YOU FUCKING
KIDDING ME?!

26:41.968 --> 26:44.904
( groans )

26:45.938 --> 26:48.607
FUCKER.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.645
( sighs )

26:53.913 --> 26:56.649
( music playing )

26:58.517 --> 27:01.120
SHAKE MY HAND.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.035
* IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I LEARNED *

27:49.135 --> 27:50.837
* WHEN I WAS STILL A CHILD

27:50.937 --> 27:53.873
* IT'S TO TAKE A HIDING

27:55.674 --> 27:58.410
