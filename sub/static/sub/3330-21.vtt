00:04.738 --> 00:06.672
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.674 --> 00:10.743
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.778
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:15.381
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:18.017
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.219
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.221 --> 00:21.653
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.655 --> 00:23.155
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.057
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.059 --> 00:26.692
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.128
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.130 --> 00:31.397
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.565
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.567 --> 00:35.768
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.770 --> 00:38.604
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.606 --> 00:40.572
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:44.244 --> 00:45.477
Woman:
Wedding's coming up soon.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.079
We need to give people
time to shop.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.247
Man:
I hear what you're saying,

00:48.249 --> 00:50.816
But I really don't
ever see us using china.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.085
Your parents have
beautiful wedding china.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.720
That they never use.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.122
Well, we need to
register for <i>something.</i>

00:57.124 --> 01:00.459
Okay. Well, there's this
really cool nfl chess set.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.694
Qb's the king,
cheerleader's the queen.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.830
Never... Ever...

01:05.799 --> 01:07.332
(whispers):
...Ever.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.434
China it is.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.401
That's my boy.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.104
Ready to roll?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.639
(beeping)
yeah.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.508
Okay.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.445
System up and running.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.679
Diagnostic
clear.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.081
Good to go, sarah.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.115
(whooshing)

01:30.356 --> 01:32.357
Hooking up o2.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.830
Go for oxygen. Okay.

01:37.832 --> 01:42.267
Since reactive agent was added
to the phosphate compound.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.869
Reading off weights.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.472
Dish one: 2.2 ounces.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.740
Dish two:

01:48.742 --> 01:51.210
2.2 ounces.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.211
Dish number three...
(beeping)

01:52.213 --> 01:53.846
Babe,
your o2's dropping.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.114
Correct manually?

01:55.116 --> 01:56.415
Yeah.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.451
How's that?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.120
No increase.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.688
You know what, sarah?
I'm getting...

02:02.690 --> 02:04.690
Dizzy.
Okay. Step out.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.192
(beeps twice)

02:07.194 --> 02:09.194
Babe, the door

02:09.196 --> 02:10.262
Won't open.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.331
(beeping)

02:12.333 --> 02:13.398
Door won't respond.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.666
I'm having trouble
breathing.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.834
Sarah...

02:15.836 --> 02:17.636
(alarm blaring)
jim,

02:17.638 --> 02:19.738
Sarin gas is leaking in from
tox storage through the vents.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.241
No, no, no.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.575
Do not remove cover!

02:23.577 --> 02:24.877
Your lab's filled
with nerve gas!

02:24.879 --> 02:25.911
Hold on!

02:25.913 --> 02:27.913
(alarm continues blaring)

02:27.915 --> 02:29.915
This is sarah jacobs in zone 1.
We have a breach

02:29.917 --> 02:31.550
In the lab, and jim is in there.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.285
Somebody help us!

02:36.656 --> 02:39.358
Come on, ferret bueller,
stand up.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.593
Good boy.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.496
Look at that--
he thinks he's people.
Happy: When are we ditching

02:44.498 --> 02:45.898
This weasel?
You don't like pets?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.399
I wasn't talking
about the ferret.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.867
How long are you
gonna punish me

02:48.869 --> 02:50.235
For sleeping through our date?

02:50.237 --> 02:51.537
What's your lifespan?

02:52.505 --> 02:53.572
(engine revving)

02:56.643 --> 02:59.278
Toby:
Elia's popping in?
Good!

02:59.280 --> 03:01.647
You're here! Hope
you don't mind me

03:01.649 --> 03:02.848
Stopping by unannounced.

03:02.850 --> 03:07.186
You saved my daughter--
I can get you a
little something.

03:07.188 --> 03:10.355
Come on,
open it up.
Okay.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.661
Wow. A dc magnetic coil
for my rocket,

03:15.663 --> 03:17.829
Circa 1987.
A bit rusty.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.831
28 bucks, retail.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.733
But it comes
with something else.
Tetanus?

03:22.502 --> 03:24.303
This.

03:24.305 --> 03:27.272
Elia:
I was eating breakfast,
and it hit me.

03:27.274 --> 03:30.876
Isn't that much different
than the engine in the ferrari.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.612
Air and fuel intake
results in a propulsion
of the piston heads...

03:33.614 --> 03:36.515
That is, in theory,
what I'm doing with
my propulsion chamber.

03:36.517 --> 03:39.218
How cute-- they're finishing
each other's sentences.
Thought you should

03:39.220 --> 03:41.987
Drive it around for
a little bit, get a feel
for what you're building

03:41.989 --> 03:44.423
On a smaller scale--
but not that much smaller.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.724
You're giving him
a half-million-dollar car

03:45.726 --> 03:47.226
To help him with
his science project?

03:47.228 --> 03:48.794
It's just a loaner.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.263
Though... Truth is,
well, I got nine

03:51.265 --> 03:54.266
Of these things
and I never drive
them, so...

03:54.268 --> 03:56.702
You might want to hold on
to it for a while.
Walter,

03:56.704 --> 04:00.339
This is just a "thank you."
lying billionaire says what?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.274
Huh?
Close enough.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.575
Guys, don't ruin this for me.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.710
I already offered
walt a job,

04:04.712 --> 04:06.245
And he turned me down--
he's happy here.

04:06.247 --> 04:08.247
(phone buzzes)

04:08.249 --> 04:09.448
My driver has arrived.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.616
Walter,

04:10.618 --> 04:11.883
Enjoy the car.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.318
We'll talk soon.
Guys, say hello

04:13.320 --> 04:15.320
To the rest of
the gang for me.
Hey,

04:15.322 --> 04:16.722
Give my best
to the illuminati.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.890
Thank you. Thank...
This car has

04:18.892 --> 04:22.494
And those strings will
fly off once I'm driving

04:22.496 --> 04:24.363
At 190...

04:24.365 --> 04:25.530
Miles an hour.
What's that?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.266
Trouble.
Ralph.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.534
Come check out this engineering.

04:29.536 --> 04:30.736
Why is your kid
in the monkey suit?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.904
Picture day. He's so cute--
he wanted to pick

04:32.906 --> 04:35.274
The outfit himself.
There, look at that.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.341
You don't see
what's going on there?

04:36.343 --> 04:38.343
Mm, no.
Hey, ralphy-boy,

04:38.345 --> 04:40.012
Could you do uncle toby a favor
and take off that jacket?

04:40.014 --> 04:42.814
You don't want to get
grease on it.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.450
You better roll up those
sleeves, too, buddy,
just to be safe.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.658
Congratulations,
you're raising walter.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.026
Oh, god.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.762
Ralph! Ralph,
my action figure is here!

04:56.764 --> 04:59.665
Be thankful--
ralph could be emulating <i>him.</i>

04:59.667 --> 05:01.333
It came in
this morning.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.534
It's very rare.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.303
A silicone rubber,
composite prototype

05:04.305 --> 05:06.772
Of the original
super fun guy action figure

05:06.774 --> 05:08.307
From the 1970s.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.008
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be receiving

05:10.010 --> 05:12.077
The rest of the gang:
The giggler,

05:12.079 --> 05:13.845
Sir jokes-a-lot,
zany zoey,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.080
The entire team!

05:15.082 --> 05:16.682
Just like us.

05:16.684 --> 05:20.018
Cool, but...
I'm not really part of scorpion.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.387
Hey, hey, of course you are.
You helped us crack

05:22.389 --> 05:23.755
That video game that
caught those bad guys.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.557
You-you hacked that
japanese warship.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.427
You're a very, very
important part of the team.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.362
And, ralph, that's why
this one is for you.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.697
He can't have that.

05:31.699 --> 05:35.867
Thank you.
Okay, off to school.
I'll take that.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.902
Ralph.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.437
Paige:
Race cars?

05:38.439 --> 05:39.604
Collectible toys?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.573
You guys spoil him.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.076
Toby:
Can I drive the car?
Nope.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.111
â™ª

05:46.113 --> 05:48.547
The neurotoxin research
facility right outside of l.A.

05:48.549 --> 05:51.383
Something tells me I'm not
gonna like what's in this file.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.951
Someone took over the
building this morning.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.486
It's computerized to the hilt.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.055
Whoever hacked in
has total control.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.092
Labs where the nerve agents
are stored,

06:00.094 --> 06:02.060
And a ventilation system
that could spread gas

06:02.062 --> 06:04.129
Throughout the facility,
killing everyone who's
trapped inside.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.697
How many?

06:05.699 --> 06:07.132
23 very scared scientists.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.835
One of whom-- jim stone--
has been locked in a room

06:09.837 --> 06:11.570
That the hacker
filled with sarin.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.106
And he's keeping stone's o2
levels in his hazmat suit

06:14.108 --> 06:15.907
So low, he's
barely breathing.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.776
So, if stone keeps
the suit on much longer,

06:17.778 --> 06:20.512
He runs out of air, and if
he takes it off, he's dead.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.680
It gets better.

06:21.682 --> 06:24.516
Our little baghdad
bombings from '97

06:24.518 --> 06:26.118
Have come back
to bite us in the ass.

06:26.120 --> 06:30.055
How?
Hacker wants the president
to disclose on live tv

06:30.057 --> 06:31.990
Everything about the bombings
we never released.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.092
How we missed
our intended target

06:34.094 --> 06:36.728
And killed 2,000 civilians,
how we covered it up.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.431
Commander in chief
cannot concede to threats.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.967
We have any leads on this guy?
Homeland hasn't
been able to trace

06:41.969 --> 06:44.536
The e-mail communiquÃ©
that's been coming in to hq.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.037
Bouncing off servers
all over the world.

06:46.039 --> 06:48.640
All we know is that it came in
from a cell phone.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.843
Time frame?
Perp wanted potus on the air
within 90 minutes

06:51.845 --> 06:54.045
Or we'd be sorry--
that was 40 minutes ago.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.914
So get your team
to the site asap.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.849
The media already has wind
that something's up.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.851
Before you know it,
it'll be a circus.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.159
Newswoman:
After the '95 tokyo subway
sarin gas attacks,

07:07.161 --> 07:10.195
The United States created
an anti-neurotoxin program

07:10.197 --> 07:13.098
That resulted in the lab
that is now under siege.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.067
We are more than an hour
into this takeover.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.571
Now, experts claim if any
of this neurotoxic material

07:19.573 --> 07:21.840
Were to aerosol
out of the facility,

07:21.842 --> 07:24.810
It could possibly kill
thousands of angelenos.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.679
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.114
Credentials?
Cabe:
It's all right.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.916
She's with me.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.851
The five zones
of the building
run east to west.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.020
Some larger, with free access
to multiple rooms.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.556
Other zones are
mostly laboratories.
There's a vent system

07:37.558 --> 07:39.124
Linked to a server, so air flow,

07:39.126 --> 07:41.193
Including the release
of nerve gas into the vents,

07:41.195 --> 07:42.594
Could be manipulated.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.765
We got hazmat on
standby, and they're ready.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.033
My god,
what a nightmare.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.668
Toby:
As this poor guy, jim,

07:49.670 --> 07:52.204
Already learned, his o2 levels
are at the bottom rung.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.772
We need to figure out
a way in asap.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.841
I can rig a charge
to blow through that door

07:55.843 --> 07:58.043
In five minutes.
Swat leader: No go. All doors
are computer-controlled.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.011
We breach 'em, the hacker
sees this on the system,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.013
And instantly
releases the gas.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.949
It's not just the door
that won't let us in--

08:03.951 --> 08:05.951
Whoever hacked this lab
set up some sort of block

08:05.953 --> 08:07.752
That I've never seen before.
I can't even get

08:07.754 --> 08:08.854
Within a mile
of the network.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.589
The hacker's
90-minute deadline

08:10.591 --> 08:12.858
Is practically up,
and, uh, we will not be able

08:12.860 --> 08:14.125
To regain control in time.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.760
You think or you know?
I know.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.963
We're in the dark right now
as to how he got in

08:17.965 --> 08:19.564
And what he's doing
to keep us out.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.500
I'm also, um...

08:21.502 --> 08:22.968
I'm concerned from
an efficiency standpoint

08:22.970 --> 08:25.170
That my personal connection
to the case

08:25.172 --> 08:29.241
Might affect my ability
to solve it, so...

08:29.243 --> 08:31.042
What's happening right now,
it's not your fault.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.777
I designed the software
used for the bombs.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.112
The bombs killed the civilians.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.947
The hacker wants revenge
for those deaths.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.883
I'm in the dna
of this thing, cabe.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.085
No, you're not.
You were just a kid.
(sighs)

08:40.087 --> 08:41.753
The blame lies with me.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.122
Now, right now
we got a job to do, okay?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.624
Merrick:
Hq's getting another e-mail.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.925
"I told you what I wanted.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.960
You've give me nothing.
Time's up."

08:48.962 --> 08:51.162
Three sentences-- issue,
application, conclusion.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.833
About to take action.
Something's wrong, guys.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.136
Sarah (over speaker):
Oh, god, jim, just hold on,
okay? Hold on!

08:58.138 --> 08:59.738
I'm gonna try to override
the system.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.206
The hacker's
cut off his oxygen.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.208
Sylvester: She can't override
the system. We're helpless.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.610
Come on!

09:05.612 --> 09:06.778
Sarah...

09:06.780 --> 09:08.079
He can't breathe.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.614
Turn it off.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.883
Cabe! Turn it off!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.718
Sarah:
Jim, no, hang on, okay?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.220
(gasping breaths)

09:15.222 --> 09:17.889
It's not working! Damn it!

09:17.891 --> 09:19.691
Jim:
I have to open my mask.
I can't breathe.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.092
No! Oh, god,
jim, hold on!

09:21.094 --> 09:23.061
Do not remove your helmet!
Just hold on!

09:23.063 --> 09:25.330
He takes that off,
he's dead in seconds.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.165
Don't take off your helmet,
okay? Hold on...

09:27.167 --> 09:29.067
(takes deep breath)

09:29.069 --> 09:30.201
(alarm continues blaring)

09:35.007 --> 09:37.842
(sobbing):
Jim!

09:39.845 --> 09:42.280
Jim!

09:42.282 --> 09:44.349
(sarah continues sobbing)

09:56.195 --> 09:58.797
Newswoman: Tensions are high as
the unfolding hostage situation

09:58.799 --> 10:00.665
Has now become a murder scene.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.100
With the victim's body
unrecovered

10:02.102 --> 10:04.636
And dozens still trapped inside,

10:04.638 --> 10:06.371
The question
everyone's asking is:

10:06.373 --> 10:08.373
What are the authorities
going to do?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.275
Hacker's now saying that
everyone dies in 60 minutes

10:10.277 --> 10:12.143
If we don't give in
to his demands.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.646
We got to get in there <i>now!</i>
<i>Yelling doesn't help.</i>

10:14.648 --> 10:16.748
I don't even have
a digital foot in the door.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.883
He basically made
the entire system invisible,

10:18.885 --> 10:22.687
Cabe: Structural?
Well, the third time I've been
through the blueprints--

10:22.689 --> 10:24.623
No weaknesses.
Unless we can un-hack

10:24.625 --> 10:25.790
Those security doors,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.792
We're not getting in.
She's breaking down.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.394
Toby:
At a base level, we're feeling

10:29.396 --> 10:31.396
The same frustration as her--
outside looking in.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.264
Helplessness is
a destructive emotion.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.733
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.301
Outside looking in.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.069
We need to do that.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.639
We need to look
into the building-- right now,

10:40.641 --> 10:42.741
We're out here trying to jump

10:42.743 --> 10:44.376
On an external network signal--
but we can't.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.311
Maybe that's because
the problem is internal.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.014
Like an actual physical
compromise to the building's
internal server.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.415
The hacker's been manipulating

10:50.417 --> 10:52.651
A system
he did not design.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.052
He could've overloaded
certain portions of it,

10:54.054 --> 10:56.421
Like burnt circuits, wiring,
and if that's so,

10:56.423 --> 11:00.291
That's why we can't get
into the system from out here.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.327
Fried hardware. We fix it,

11:02.329 --> 11:03.995
We can get control of the system

11:03.997 --> 11:06.331
And then we can retake control
of the building.
Exactly.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.200
Now, we need to search the
blueprints for the server hub.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.101
Gallo.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.670
Just got off

11:11.672 --> 11:15.440
Bodies dropping is bad press,
but potus still can't be

11:15.442 --> 11:16.775
Puppet-mastered by some thug.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.443
So they found a middle ground.

11:18.445 --> 11:19.711
An appeasement?

11:19.713 --> 11:21.980
Related to the baghdad bombing

11:21.982 --> 11:23.682
In a massive document dump,

11:23.684 --> 11:26.217
Everything from combat
weather reports

11:26.219 --> 11:27.819
To supply requisitions.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.721
So it looks as if
it's a run-of-the-mill

11:29.723 --> 11:31.189
Declassification of records.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.891
Based on what the hacker's
looking for,

11:32.893 --> 11:35.293
Is it necessary
to release all documents

11:35.295 --> 11:39.731
Particularly certain memorandum
between you and I

11:39.733 --> 11:41.733
A few days prior to the bombing?

11:41.735 --> 11:44.069
We're mid-standoff,

11:44.071 --> 11:45.904
And you want me
to cherry-pick out data

11:45.906 --> 11:47.238
So you don't hurt
your relationship

11:47.240 --> 11:52.343
O'brien is instrumental to
scorpion and national security.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.213
Anything
that might disrupt that...

11:55.215 --> 11:56.881
I am homeland director.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.751
So I will worry about what
disrupts national security.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.328
Hey.

12:10.330 --> 12:14.933
Have o'brien meet me around
back. It's important.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.802
What, more demands
from the hacker?

12:19.405 --> 12:23.508
There are things about baghdad
that you don't know.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.844
What things?

12:25.846 --> 12:29.180
Son, I was honest with you
when I told you

12:29.182 --> 12:31.182
That I had no idea
the government planned

12:31.184 --> 12:33.351
To use your technology
for munitions

12:33.353 --> 12:36.221
Instead of aid packages.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.089
You were just a kid.
I would never have lied to you.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.891
I already know this.

12:40.893 --> 12:44.028
Son, you know
how I feel about you.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.965
Cabe, what are you trying
to tell me?

12:49.835 --> 12:54.172
Three days
before the bombs were dropped,

12:54.174 --> 12:57.475
Merrick told me
of the true agenda.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.780
You knew

13:01.782 --> 13:03.515
They were gonna drop bombs?

13:03.517 --> 13:05.950
Not at first.
Just three days prior.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.952
And you never told me.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.554
I was concerned that if I did,

13:09.556 --> 13:12.791
You would disable your software
and sabotage the mission.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.959
That's exactly
what I would have done.
And you would've gone

13:14.961 --> 13:17.428
To prison for doing so, and I
would've been tried for treason.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.967
Son, I had no idea that
civilians would've been killed.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.837
The target was an iraqi leader.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.909
Come on, walter. Say something.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.878
If you're done,
I have work to do.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.019
Toby: Right there. Cam 23,
bottom left. We got it.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.922
Walt, where have you been? We
found the server hub in zone 1.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.990
Paige:
Walter.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.992
Are you okay?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.962
Walter, you hear me?

13:52.031 --> 13:54.065
What the hell is going on here?

13:54.067 --> 13:57.235
Nothing. Uh, let me see...
Let me see this.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.003
(speaks indistinctly)

13:59.005 --> 14:01.606
Okay.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.141
Okay, excuse me.

14:03.143 --> 14:06.845
What are you doing?
I'm calling sarah.
She's the only scientist

14:06.847 --> 14:08.580
In zone 1. If we're gonna save
these people,

14:08.582 --> 14:10.014
Then we'll need her help.
Walter.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.083
What are you doing?
She just lost her fiancÃ©,

14:12.085 --> 14:13.518
And you've got something
going on.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.986
You want her to
be able to help,

14:14.988 --> 14:16.855
Then she'll need to talk
to someone human.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.590
(phone rings)

14:18.592 --> 14:21.025
Hello?
Sarah,

14:21.027 --> 14:22.527
I'm-I'm paige dineen.
I'm with the team trying

14:22.529 --> 14:25.930
I-I can't imagine
what you've been dealing with

14:25.932 --> 14:27.565
Or-or what you're going
through right now,

14:27.567 --> 14:29.267
But if you and your coworkers

14:29.269 --> 14:31.536
Are going to get out of there,
we're gonna need your help.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.906
We-we...
We were getting married.

14:34.908 --> 14:35.874
We need to hurry. We need...

14:36.409 --> 14:41.179
And he'd want you to be safe and
to get out of there and-and live

14:41.181 --> 14:43.147
The rest of your life.
But to do that,

14:43.149 --> 14:46.651
You'll need to get
to the server hub down by

14:46.653 --> 14:49.087
The far west entrance.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.221
And bring your cell phone.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.389
We'll need to see each other.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.526
Woman:
<i>Do you know what the word</i>

14:55.528 --> 14:59.631
Suitable for a particular
purpose, person, or occasion.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.000
In school,
do you think it's appropriate

15:02.002 --> 15:05.536
To explain in detail the effects
nerve gas has on the human body?

15:05.538 --> 15:08.306
We were doing science.
It wasn't

15:08.308 --> 15:10.475
Appropriate, ralph. I know

15:10.477 --> 15:12.210
Everyone's in a tizzy
over what's going on

15:12.212 --> 15:13.478
In the news,
but we have

15:13.480 --> 15:14.545
To keep it appropriate.
(knocking)

15:14.547 --> 15:17.282
Excuse me,
principal pastorneck.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.616
You're needed in
mr. Berger's class.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.118
(sighs)

15:20.120 --> 15:22.453
You stay here.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.657
(door shuts)

15:27.459 --> 15:29.294
(typing)

15:33.065 --> 15:36.234
In addition to swat,
homeland security, and the fbi,

15:36.236 --> 15:38.703
Independent government
contractor, team scorpion,

15:38.705 --> 15:44.208
Considering the stakes,
they'll need all hands on deck.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.736
Okay, I'm here.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.738
Paige:
I'm putting you on speaker
so you can hear

16:13.740 --> 16:15.173
From the rest of our team.

16:17.042 --> 16:18.476
Hi, sarah.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.744
Um, can you open

16:19.746 --> 16:22.680
The panel and point
your camera at it?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.749
Great.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.684
Sylvester:
Nothing out
of the ordinary.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.686
Oh, oh. Okay, um,
the large red cables

16:28.688 --> 16:29.988
To your left,
can you move them

16:29.990 --> 16:31.489
To the side?
Let's see behind it.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.293
Yeah. There it is.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.594
Oh, boy.
Merrick:
What?

16:36.596 --> 16:39.230
I was right. It is
an internal structural problem,

16:39.232 --> 16:40.999
But the wires weren't fried--
they were cut.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.333
What do you mean "cut"?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.036
Sarah, uh, what is
your system-check protocol?

16:45.038 --> 16:47.238
I run a diagnostic every morning
at 8:15

16:47.240 --> 16:51.175
And today
everything checked out?
Yes. No one's left since.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.011
Not good.
Paige:
What?

16:53.013 --> 16:54.345
What's not good?
It was
an inside job.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.081
The person who cut the
wireless server cables,

16:57.083 --> 16:59.250
The hacker, is inside
the building right now.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.718
Oh, god.
Sarah,

17:00.720 --> 17:02.720
I need you
to remain calm, all right?

17:02.722 --> 17:04.255
We need you.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.057
You're the only one
that we can count on.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.626
All right, first things first,
we need to get you back

17:08.628 --> 17:11.029
To your control room.
All the labs have monitors,

17:11.031 --> 17:12.230
And if the hacker
sees you moving about,

17:12.232 --> 17:13.698
Checking
the server hubs,

17:13.700 --> 17:17.035
How do you know he didn't see me
on my way down here?

17:17.037 --> 17:19.137
He would've killed you already.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.138
What? It's true.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.074
Okay, based
on hallway dimensions

17:23.076 --> 17:25.777
And security camera
points of view,

17:25.779 --> 17:27.445
I can calculate the blind spots

17:27.447 --> 17:29.347
Along the way back
to the control room.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.584
Come get me out!

17:33.586 --> 17:35.553
She's hysterical.
Whoever

17:35.555 --> 17:36.721
Killed jim

17:36.723 --> 17:40.291
Is in the building with me.
Sarah,

17:40.293 --> 17:43.161
This is agent cabe gallo,
homeland security.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.463
You're gonna have
to trust us.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.465
If you keep calling attention
to yourself,

17:47.467 --> 17:48.800
Who's ever in there
will see you.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.568
Now, you know
that we can't

17:50.570 --> 17:52.236
Get through those doors.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.772
Trust is the only way
this is gonna work.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.208
So we trust you to get
the job done. You trust us

17:57.210 --> 17:59.110
To keep you safe.
Just shut up!

18:00.312 --> 18:02.380
Shut up. Shut up, cabe.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.348
Walter.
Sylvester,

18:04.350 --> 18:06.217
Get sarah safely back
to the control room.

18:06.219 --> 18:07.218
And, cabe,

18:07.220 --> 18:08.686
You do not get to tell anybody

18:08.688 --> 18:11.255
To trust you ever again.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.524
Okay. Take it easy.
You slip so easily

18:13.526 --> 18:15.793
Into asking people to trust you
when you want something

18:15.795 --> 18:17.762
From them.
Walter,

18:17.764 --> 18:19.363
Let's talk about this.
No.

18:19.365 --> 18:21.365
I'm not gonna be tricked
into believing you.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.434
Not a second time.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.836
So, director,

18:24.838 --> 18:26.137
We'll do everything that we can

18:26.139 --> 18:27.705
To save these people's lives,
but...

18:27.707 --> 18:29.440
Once this case is concluded,

18:29.442 --> 18:31.843
I want agent gallo
off scorpion.

18:31.845 --> 18:34.512
I do not want to work
with him ever again.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.180
Toby:
Uh, bro,

18:36.182 --> 18:38.416
Let's take a breath.
No, let's not
take a breath.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.285
I want gallo out, or I quit.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.820
End of story.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.814
What just happened?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.349
Nothing important.
It...

19:11.351 --> 19:13.885
Seemed important.
Very important.

19:13.887 --> 19:16.821
Not more than saving the lives
of the people in this facility.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.623
Starting with sarah,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.159
Who needs you to get her
out of that control room.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.761
Sarah, hug the wall to your left
and go to the...

19:23.763 --> 19:25.363
Can we just clarify
that you're saying cabe

19:25.365 --> 19:27.298
Is no longer on the team?
Consider it clarified.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.369
That the hacker is sending
e-mails via cell phone.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.172
Let's pull up surveillance
footage of a-a minute prior

19:34.174 --> 19:35.640
To when we received
each e-mail.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.442
Look for, uh,
suspicious behavior.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.777
That's gonna take a minute.

19:40.679 --> 19:41.679
Walter:
Hey.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.614
We have a job to do.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.183
This <i>is</i> my job.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.388
(siren chirps)

19:50.390 --> 19:52.924
If he's asking me to
leave the premises,

19:52.926 --> 19:55.626
I will not until the job's done.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.862
Even if he'd said it,
I-I wouldn't pass it on.

19:57.864 --> 20:01.666
I always knew I'd have to tell
him the truth about baghdad.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.800
He's not the only member
of this team.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.469
He cannot make
unilateral decisions.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.471
It's his worst nightmare.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.207
And mine, too.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.976
Which is why I tried to come
clean 50 times but I didn't

20:11.978 --> 20:13.578
Have the guts.
I will do

20:13.580 --> 20:17.381
Everything I can
to help mend it. Okay?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.383
The last time took 16 years.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.252
This may be it.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.488
Paige. We may have something.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.923
If you care
to be kept apprised.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.260
Go.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.398
Okay, these are each
of the five zones

20:34.400 --> 20:35.833
Of the building.
The threatening e-mails

20:35.835 --> 20:39.804
Were received at
8:43, 9:39, and 11:08.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.241
Just before each of them
were sent, this figure

20:43.243 --> 20:44.609
Ducks into a blind spot.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.677
He goes beyond the view
of cameras.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.346
He goes somewhere
we can't see him.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.348
30 seconds later
we get an e-mail.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.583
Okay, run the guy
against employee files.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.518
Sylvester:
Did cabe leave?

20:54.520 --> 20:55.686
Is he seriously gone?

20:55.688 --> 20:56.687
He's outside.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.322
Not going anywhere.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.824
Happy:
Okay. We are looking

20:59.826 --> 21:01.525
At dr. Simon boyd.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.461
Neurobiologist.
Merrick:
We can't go in guns blazing

21:03.463 --> 21:04.795
On a guy just for e-mailing.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.597
Sylvester:
You shouldn't go in
guns blazing at all.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.868
From this office, he has
the ability to release sarin gas

21:10.870 --> 21:12.937
Into any test lab
in this building.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.805
Toby:
Not just the ability

21:14.807 --> 21:16.841
But the desire.
High profile event,

21:16.843 --> 21:18.643
Unattainable demands--

21:18.645 --> 21:19.910
This is more
of a suicide mission

21:19.912 --> 21:21.279
Than a hostage situation.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.813
Happy:
If he's that crazy,
I can guarantee

21:22.815 --> 21:24.682
He's hooked up the tox storage

21:24.684 --> 21:25.983
To the entire
ventilation system.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.519
From the specs, it'd
be simple to do.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.022
All right, the only way
to take back the building
and open the doors

21:31.024 --> 21:33.958
Is to get inside and replace
the server cable that was cut.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.560
No one's been able
to get inside all morning.
Yeah,

21:36.562 --> 21:38.896
That's just because we haven't
thought about it hard enough.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.631
There's always an answer--
we just need

21:40.633 --> 21:42.433
To find it.
All the doors are locked,

21:42.435 --> 21:44.635
And I'm assuming this perp--
if he is our perp--

21:44.637 --> 21:45.903
Is watching the
surveillance monitors.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.306
He is. He's got access
to all the same footage

21:48.308 --> 21:50.641
That we do.
Happy:
He's absolutely our guy.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.076
Government records say
he started his career

21:52.078 --> 21:54.779
Studying the effects
of neurotoxin in baghdad

21:54.781 --> 21:57.548
16 years ago. He returned
from his trip to jordan

21:57.550 --> 21:58.816
To find his
entire neighborhood

21:58.818 --> 22:01.385
Decimated.
Among the wounded was his

22:01.387 --> 22:03.954
FiancÃ©e, left comatose
and on life support

22:03.956 --> 22:06.924
Until 18 months ago,
when she died.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.559
Just before he began
working here.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.894
When he started
studying the facility,

22:09.896 --> 22:12.963
Finding its weaknesses,
planning his revenge.

22:14.966 --> 22:17.902
Okay, uh, let's all
put our minds toward

22:17.904 --> 22:20.738
Finding a way into
the building without passing

22:20.740 --> 22:23.040
Surveillance cameras
or opening computerized

22:23.042 --> 22:24.909
Doors or sensors.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.544
I know there are
lives at risk.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.646
But you may be
exacerbating that risk

22:28.648 --> 22:30.648
By sidelining
one of the team.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.484
I can fill the gap.
He's a distraction.
He's a friend.

22:33.486 --> 22:36.787
Okay, I got it-- level nine
government research lab.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.856
It's required to burn all
its documents because shredded

22:38.858 --> 22:40.891
Paper can always be
put back together.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.627
In other words, we go in through
the incinerator because

22:43.629 --> 22:45.496
There's no surveillance on it.
We'll have to go

22:45.498 --> 22:47.898
Past a flame burning
at roughly 750 degrees.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.701
We hack the municipal gas line,
shut down the incinerator.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.003
Uh, residual
heat will be intense,

22:53.005 --> 22:54.905
So, uh, we'll need
heat-resistant suits

22:54.907 --> 22:56.607
From the fire department.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.975
How are you
climbing down?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.877
Rope will combust,
cable or chain could

22:59.879 --> 23:03.013
Weaken and break.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.782
Guys, what did elia
give me this morning?

23:04.784 --> 23:07.685
Everything short of an
open-mouth kiss.
A magnet. A magnet.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.887
The vent's made of steel
alloy. We need magnets.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.858
Those news guys weren't too
thrilled that we dismantled

23:13.860 --> 23:15.760
Their edit bays
to get these magnets.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.628
Yeah, well, they'll survive,
the people inside may not.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.463
Sylvester, where are we?
I've got good news

23:19.465 --> 23:20.965
And bad.
Which first?

23:20.967 --> 23:22.566
Uh, the good.
Getting into
the municipal system

23:22.568 --> 23:24.902
Was a cinch.
Their password is 1234.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.804
The bad is,
this facility has its own

23:26.806 --> 23:28.939
Internal natural gas supply.
It's a fail-safe

23:28.941 --> 23:30.775
In case heat-sensitive
experiments are left running

23:30.777 --> 23:31.909
And the city gas goes out.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.778
It will also restart
the incinerator.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.446
Shut down the backup, too.
I could control

23:35.448 --> 23:36.947
The backup if the server cable
was functioning,

23:36.949 --> 23:38.549
But it's not.
How long before the backup

23:38.551 --> 23:40.551
Reignites the incinerator?
Three minutes

23:40.553 --> 23:42.420
Or 90 seconds,
depending on the model,

23:42.422 --> 23:44.054
Which isn't specified
in the blueprints.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.990
Okay, we'll move
fast. Toby, suit up.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.591
Toby, stay here.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.993
Walter,

23:48.995 --> 23:50.561
You're sneaking into
a facility controlled

23:50.563 --> 23:52.062
By a madman.
If you were thinking

23:52.064 --> 23:55.566
The person going with you
would be carrying a gun

23:55.568 --> 23:58.002
And know how to use it.
That's cabe.
I have to

23:58.004 --> 24:00.838
Go in with someone I can trust.
Cabe is deceitful and deceptive.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.909
He's proved otherwise.
Right now you cannot save anyone

24:04.911 --> 24:07.178
If you're killed the second
you enter the building.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.147
Consider the greater good.

24:11.983 --> 24:16.120
All right. Just say the word
when you're ready.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.690
My own
personal invention:

24:19.692 --> 24:22.726
A soldering pen,
or flip the switch...

24:22.728 --> 24:24.995
And it cuts faster
than an arc torch.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.932
You'll be able to patch
the network cable in no time.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.801
These have a flux output of n52,

24:30.803 --> 24:33.037
So it's gonna take all the upper
arm strength you've got.

24:33.039 --> 24:38.008
On magnets. Down a...
Blazing hot metal tube.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.744
Why don't we get moving, okay?
Comm's in, everyone.

24:40.746 --> 24:42.012
Got it.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.081
Hey. Good luck.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.616
Gonna need it.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.651
Sylvester, kill the gas.

24:58.530 --> 25:01.065
(grunting)

25:02.133 --> 25:04.034
Walter.
Just keep

25:04.036 --> 25:05.769
Conversations
to the bare essentials.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.538
How many times do we have
to save each other's lives

25:07.540 --> 25:09.974
Before you realize I'm not the
same guy that made that mistake?

25:09.976 --> 25:11.108
I said only the bare essentials.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.877
Grow the hell up.
People might

25:12.879 --> 25:14.144
Die here today and you're
only thinking about

25:14.146 --> 25:17.014
Yourself.
Thanks to you,

25:17.016 --> 25:19.550
I don't sleep.
Recurring nightmares...

25:19.552 --> 25:21.652
You think you're the only
one that has those dreams?

25:21.654 --> 25:23.687
You guys are gonna need to fight
later, because the incinerator

25:23.689 --> 25:25.189
Just turned back on.

25:27.792 --> 25:30.261
Evidently we're dealing with
the 90-second model. Aah!

25:30.263 --> 25:33.063
Our suits won't protect us
long under these new conditions.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.000
We need to climb up
and regroup. (grunts)

25:36.002 --> 25:37.001
Walter.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.670
My magnets are slipping.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.005
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's happening in there?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.207
Excessive heat
causes atoms to speed up,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.309
Decreasing
magnetic domains. This

25:45.311 --> 25:46.677
Lack of cohesion

25:46.679 --> 25:48.178
Weakens magnetic force.

25:48.180 --> 25:52.182
Cut the science lesson. I'm
headed toward a burning furnace!

25:59.190 --> 26:01.325
Walter, I'm losing ground here.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.227
Walter:
It's 'cause you're
heavier than me.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.030
Guys, we got to come up
with a solution fast.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.298
Okay, they can't go down,
we can't reach them

26:07.300 --> 26:10.167
To pull them back up.
Through the side?

26:10.169 --> 26:11.335
Just throwing ideas out, here.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.304
No, no, that's
brilliant. Walt,

26:13.306 --> 26:16.707
The soldering pen. Slide the
handle switch to torch mode

26:16.709 --> 26:18.676
And it should
slice the vent wall.
Leading to what?

26:18.678 --> 26:21.278
If there's a concrete wall
beside the vent it doesn't help.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.847
And that is what's
beside the vent, unless you're

26:23.849 --> 26:26.317
17 feet down from the vent
opening facing north,

26:26.319 --> 26:28.218
Where there is a crawl space.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.721
Okay, I put you
about 15 feet down.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.057
And, uh, north
is toward me.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.826
Okay. Okay.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.962
I need a hand free
to operate the torch.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.363
Come on, come on, come on.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.231
Ooh, ooh. Oh.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.099
Walter.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.868
(grunting)

26:44.870 --> 26:46.804
Walter, I'm headed
towards oblivion.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.739
When you get to my foot,
grab hold

26:48.741 --> 26:51.275
And I'll pull you up into
the hole when it's cut. (grunts)

26:51.277 --> 26:54.111
My weight'll pull you down.
So only grab hold of my foot

26:54.113 --> 26:57.281
After I get a grip on the cut

26:57.283 --> 26:58.649
Inside the vent shaft.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.184
All right, here we go.

27:05.357 --> 27:07.625
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

27:11.296 --> 27:12.630
Kid, where you going?

27:12.632 --> 27:14.665
I'm part of the scorpion team.

27:14.667 --> 27:17.001
No, this is no place
for you. Come with me.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.737
Sit in my squad car
until I can call your mom.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.840
I got a schoolkid here.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.810
(static)

27:26.812 --> 27:28.712
Walter: Aah! The heat
is becoming untenable.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.250
Oh, geez. The vent temperature
is nearing 400 degrees.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.953
Kid, I got a few seconds, then
you're gonna be out of reach.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.088
I need more time.
I don't think we have any.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.957
And if that's the case,
hear me out.
I have no

27:39.959 --> 27:41.325
Intention
of listening to another

27:41.327 --> 27:43.260
Apology right now,
'cause we're

27:43.262 --> 27:45.062
Getting out of here.

27:50.368 --> 27:51.702
Aah!

27:51.704 --> 27:54.338
(panting)

27:56.075 --> 27:59.877
I can't reach it.
Grab on to my foot, climb up.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.046
I... I can't grab it.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.314
(grunting)

28:04.316 --> 28:05.883
Come on, come on.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.252
Come on.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.421
Come on, cabe!

28:11.256 --> 28:13.257
(both grunting)

28:14.893 --> 28:17.027
Come on.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.228
Climb up now!

28:18.230 --> 28:20.264
Come on.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.900
Get up.
(grunting)

28:22.902 --> 28:25.769
Come on.
They're in.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.774
(coughs)

28:30.776 --> 28:33.243
Thank you, walter.
Thank you.

28:36.347 --> 28:38.248
We're not finished yet.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.284
Sylvester, lead us
to the server hub.

28:40.286 --> 28:43.487
Come on.

28:43.489 --> 28:47.257
Simon's out of frame again.
I'm guessing he's about

28:47.259 --> 28:49.326
To put our feet
to the fire.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.196
So to speak.
(phone chirps)

28:52.198 --> 28:55.032
Incoming e-mail.
"you have five minutes to prove

28:55.034 --> 28:57.367
"the president will meet
my demands on live television

28:57.369 --> 28:59.236
"or the hostages are dead.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.039
You have five minutes
until I kill these people."

29:02.041 --> 29:03.207
Walter and cabe
are at the server hub.

29:03.209 --> 29:04.508
It's up there,
it's up there.

29:06.344 --> 29:10.380
How long?
The server cable will be
repaired in 30 seconds.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.250
Then sylvester can regain
control of the building. Get to

29:13.252 --> 29:15.119
Zone 5, evacuate
the hostages, then zone 4,

29:15.121 --> 29:16.386
Et cetera, et cetera.

29:16.388 --> 29:21.825
There's just over four minutes
until simon releases the sarin.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.427
And he's not looking
at the monitors, so,

29:23.429 --> 29:27.297
Okay, I'll find simon, keep
him away from the monitors,

29:27.299 --> 29:29.233
And you evacuate the hostages.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.235
The man's psychotic.
I handle the face-to-face.

29:31.237 --> 29:34.505
Better than I do. In two minutes
I could probably figure them out

29:34.507 --> 29:38.408
And improve them, but it's time
that we don't have. Cabe, go.

29:41.479 --> 29:44.381
Cabe, stay tight to the wall.
You need to hug the corner

29:44.383 --> 29:47.317
To your left. In front of you
should be the door to the lab.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.520
The zone 5 hostages
are in that room.
Hey, help! Get us out of here!

29:50.523 --> 29:55.392
Sylvester, you should have
control of the facility.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.895
I think... I've got it.
The building's ours.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.264
One minute till he
gasses the building.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.166
Walter, you got to hustle
to simon

30:02.168 --> 30:03.934
Or I won't be able
to get these people out.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.870
He's playing the role of
hostage, so you play your role.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.005
Walter, he sees you.

30:09.073 --> 30:10.240
Hey.

30:10.242 --> 30:12.376
Who are you?

30:12.378 --> 30:13.977
I'm with swat.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.479
We're trying to figure out
a way to get

30:15.481 --> 30:17.548
Simon's not facing the monitors.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.817
Now, cabe.

30:20.852 --> 30:23.387
Everybody, move fast, move fast.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.455
How did you get in?
I sawed a hole

30:25.457 --> 30:28.959
In the wall of the
incinerator exhaust.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.528
Alone?

30:31.530 --> 30:33.230
One-man rescue team?

30:33.232 --> 30:34.598
That's right.
I'm a recon scout.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.274
Those are the mechanical
overrides, walter.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.611
Even though we have control
of the computer system.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.379
Sly, open the door.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.349
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
It's me you want.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.917
I killed your fiancÃ©e.

30:55.453 --> 30:58.021
I was responsible
for what happened in baghdad.

31:00.558 --> 31:04.027
You... Are lying to me.

31:06.497 --> 31:09.499
I was the programming contractor
who designed

31:09.501 --> 31:11.134
The targeting system

31:11.136 --> 31:13.003
For the bombs
that killed your fiancÃ©e

31:13.005 --> 31:14.504
And everyone else.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.040
It's me you want.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.209
These people are innocent.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.044
No.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.181
No, what I want
is justice for daliyah.

31:24.183 --> 31:27.885
And that...
You can't give to me.

31:27.887 --> 31:28.485
Gun.

31:30.521 --> 31:34.191
You're not gonna shoot anyone.

31:34.193 --> 31:37.461
You don't want there to be
any more casualties from today

31:37.463 --> 31:39.529
From that bombing.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.266
Now, you're distraught

31:42.268 --> 31:44.935
Over your loss.
Simon, I get it.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.637
But you're not a bad man.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.039
Zone 3 is evaced.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.541
I'm all clear here.
I got to go help walter.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.943
You keep evacuating the others.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.444
Who are you talking to?

31:54.446 --> 31:56.413
Give me that
earpiece.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.016
Now.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.084
Now!

32:07.425 --> 32:09.026
The world

32:09.028 --> 32:12.496
Is now gonna see
how she suffered.

32:12.498 --> 32:13.563
Simon, listen to me.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.200
Simon, stop!

32:17.202 --> 32:18.468
He released the sarin.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.704
Now I'm gonna take him outside

32:20.706 --> 32:22.506
And kill this man on live tv!

32:22.508 --> 32:24.574
Move!
Okay.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.644
Uh, guys, the gas

32:27.646 --> 32:30.314
Is in zone 5, which means
you have less than five minutes

32:30.316 --> 32:32.649
To get out of the building.

32:34.652 --> 32:38.088
Sarah, we have to go.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.589
I can't leave him.
There's nothing you

32:39.591 --> 32:42.192
Can do for him.
Simon's released the gas.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.094
If it's coming through
the ventilation system,

32:44.096 --> 32:45.595
It kicks on zone by zone,

32:45.597 --> 32:46.630
One at a time
so it doesn't overload.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.065
What zone goes first?

32:48.067 --> 32:49.433
5 down to 1.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.602
Sarah:
Only about a minute
per zone. Tops!

32:54.739 --> 32:56.740
(indistinct shouting outside)

33:07.285 --> 33:09.319
(speaks indistinctly)

33:18.629 --> 33:21.298
By the time walter and simon
are outside,

33:21.300 --> 33:23.266
I want sharpshooters on the
bluff across the street

33:23.268 --> 33:25.669
And the rooftop on the other
side of the parking lot.
Merrick: No way.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.537
I'm three minutes away
from bugging everyone out

33:27.539 --> 33:29.406
For a mile radius of here.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.641
The incinerator's vent
has a hole that you made.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.111
So once the gas
is released into zone 1,

33:34.113 --> 33:36.580
It can escape from the vents
and kill all of us.

33:37.382 --> 33:39.316
What was that?
Is that a person?

33:39.318 --> 33:40.784
Where?

33:40.786 --> 33:43.487
Middle camera, moving north.
There.

33:43.489 --> 33:45.222
Oh, my god.

33:47.458 --> 33:48.658
That's ralph.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.761
Ralph is in the building!

33:56.100 --> 33:57.534
How the hell
did he get in there?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.069
What is he doing in there?!

33:59.071 --> 34:00.370
Paige, you don't know
where you're going!

34:00.372 --> 34:01.438
Happy!

34:01.440 --> 34:03.473
He's heading north into zone 1.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.108
What the hell
is he thinking?

34:05.110 --> 34:06.376
No idea, but he is crawling

34:06.378 --> 34:08.378
Into a vent shaft that leads
to the crawl space

34:08.380 --> 34:10.514
That walter and cabe
took from

34:10.516 --> 34:12.416
The incinerator vent.
Toby:
Oh, man.

34:12.418 --> 34:14.584
He knows that if that gas
is released in zone 1,

34:14.586 --> 34:15.819
It will escape through the hole
in the vent.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.287
He's trying to save the city.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.756
Oh, uh, sly, walter fixed
the server hub.

34:19.758 --> 34:21.591
You shut down
the incinerator now!

34:24.395 --> 34:25.796
I have spent my life
since the bombing raids

34:25.798 --> 34:27.364
Trying to atone for the deaths.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.832
I will not rest
until I have saved

34:28.834 --> 34:30.500
At least that number
that have died.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.402
Please do not add any more lives
to that list.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.703
It's already too late.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.272
The incinerator is shut off.

34:35.274 --> 34:36.606
But I can't see ralph.
He's off the surveillance grid.

34:36.608 --> 34:40.077
Once the gas is released
into zone 1, how long before

34:40.079 --> 34:41.445
It escapes through
the incinerator hole?

34:41.447 --> 34:43.280
With average seepage rates,
48 seconds.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.582
I'm calling an evac!

34:45.584 --> 34:47.717
Kid, get off your ass, let's go.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.719
You can go, I will not.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.588
(indistinct shouting)

34:51.590 --> 34:54.124
Come on, people, move it.
Let's go, let's go.

35:06.137 --> 35:08.538
(grunting)

35:13.611 --> 35:16.646
Sorry, sylvester.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.855
Ralph! Ralph!

35:24.857 --> 35:26.189
Mom, I'm almost done!

35:28.526 --> 35:31.294
He's melting the silicone
rubber to seal the hole.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.529
That kid is brilliant.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.563
Okay, without
a thermal fire suit,

35:33.565 --> 35:34.631
Even with the incinerator off,

35:34.633 --> 35:36.800
The heat in the vent
is 128 degrees.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.568
A kid ralph's age
won't last long.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.871
Ralph, you need to climb out
right now!

35:40.873 --> 35:42.506
Right now!

35:42.508 --> 35:43.573
I'm begging you.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.342
Please don't let
any more blood spill

35:45.344 --> 35:49.513
As soon as you step outside,
you're done, you son of a bitch.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.681
Cabe, we are running out
of time.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.551
There's only ten seconds
until the gas reaches zone 1.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.520
You're so concerned
for your own life.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.456
Could you imagine if
you cared about other people,

35:59.458 --> 36:00.724
Thousands would still be alive.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.759
I wasn't talking about my life.

36:02.761 --> 36:04.528
I was talking about yours.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.630
(grunts)

36:12.670 --> 36:14.704
(gunshots)

36:14.706 --> 36:15.872
Nice job, son.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.474
Drop your gun!
Drop your gun!

36:17.476 --> 36:18.508
Kick it away! I'll
figure out a way

36:18.510 --> 36:19.910
To get you out
of there alive!

36:21.512 --> 36:22.579
Listen to me!

36:22.581 --> 36:23.547
I don't want you to die!

36:23.549 --> 36:24.614
Two seconds, cabe.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.749
I don't want you to die!

36:25.751 --> 36:28.752
Listen to me!
Drop the gun!

36:29.520 --> 36:31.321
I don't want you to die!

36:42.567 --> 36:44.634
Paige:
Almost, honey.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.902
You're doing great.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.807
Oh, god.
Sly, the incinerator!

36:50.809 --> 36:52.576
Someone must've pulled
the server cable again

36:52.578 --> 36:54.244
Because everything reset!

36:54.246 --> 36:56.279
Faster, ralph! Climb faster!

36:58.216 --> 37:00.884
Ralph, climb faster.
Come on, come on.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.619
Come on.
Whoa.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.621
Ralph!
The magnets!

37:04.623 --> 37:05.989
Ralph, faster, climb!

37:05.991 --> 37:07.357
I can't!

37:07.359 --> 37:09.292
Lower me down. Lower me down.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.527
Whoa!
Ralph,

37:10.529 --> 37:11.561
Grab my hand.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.662
Lower!

37:12.664 --> 37:15.398
Okay, pull me up!

37:15.400 --> 37:16.700
Come on, I got you.

37:17.802 --> 37:19.569
(panting):
Come on. Oh, my god.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.670
(panting)

37:20.672 --> 37:22.739
What the
hell were you thinking?!

37:22.741 --> 37:24.574
I had to help.
For the greater good.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.409
I'm part of the team.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.318
Oh, god.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.257
Hazmat should have this
building cleaned up

37:40.259 --> 37:41.891
And operative
in a week.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.627
Wrap it up.

37:43.629 --> 37:47.697
Now let's discuss this, uh,
personnel change you demanded.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.766
Hey, walter!

37:50.768 --> 37:51.935
Hey.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.637
Hey, take care of him.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.572
We'll finish
up tomorrow.
Okay.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.274
Let me see it.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.542
Oh, that's the way
a champion looks.

37:59.544 --> 38:01.745
Give me that.
(grunts)

38:01.747 --> 38:03.813
You did a great job.

38:05.483 --> 38:07.550
(walter speaking
indistinctly)

38:11.489 --> 38:12.889
Okay, buddy, let's go.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.425
Nice work.
Was it?

38:15.427 --> 38:18.328
I saw two more dead
added to the list.

38:18.330 --> 38:20.930
Kid, what happened
when you were 16--

38:20.932 --> 38:23.967
It's the worst thing
I ever did in my life.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.769
I regret nothing more.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.304
I'm not your kid.

38:27.306 --> 38:28.938
Not anymore.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.680
Fine.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.682
Then I'll resign

38:38.684 --> 38:41.418
From scorpion
effective immediately.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.995
Woman (on tv):
<i>Once again, the government</i>
<i>contractors known as scorpion</i>

38:51.997 --> 38:53.797
<i>Have used</i>
<i>their incredible abilities</i>

38:53.799 --> 38:56.366
<i>To save lives</i>
<i>against staggering odds.</i>

38:56.368 --> 39:00.670
And sense of accomplishment
they must be feeling right now,

39:00.672 --> 39:03.440
And what's in store for
this unique group of geniuses.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.009
Cabe will be coming
back for these--

39:06.011 --> 39:07.777
Government case files.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.580
For shredding,
just like our income.

39:10.582 --> 39:14.084
We will survive, thrive even.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.486
Is there really no way
that he's coming back?

39:16.488 --> 39:18.888
I mean... Ever?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.724
Trust was our only bond,

39:20.726 --> 39:23.059
And that's been eroded
way too far.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.061
I don't like being a pessimist.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.629
You're always a pessimist.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.031
But him leaving...

39:28.033 --> 39:29.799
Walt, it's...

39:29.801 --> 39:31.134
Not good.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.069
How's the boy?

39:33.071 --> 39:36.840
Uh, resting
with his dad.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.908
Walter?

39:38.910 --> 39:40.510
Yeah.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.882
I can tell that
you're, uh, concerned

39:45.884 --> 39:49.719
About, uh, cabe's, uh,
departure, but I, uh...

39:49.721 --> 39:52.055
You know it wasn't him who
made this team coalesce.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.823
It was you.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.726
I don't think
I can be here anymore.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.763
Can you repeat
that, please?

39:59.765 --> 40:02.832
Ralph... Admires you,
worships you...

40:02.834 --> 40:04.567
Uh-huh.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.404
...Copies everything you do,

40:07.406 --> 40:09.739
Including putting himself
in mortal danger.

40:09.741 --> 40:14.144
I-I don't think
being here is safe.

40:14.146 --> 40:16.846
Drew was offered

40:16.848 --> 40:19.182
A coaching job in maine.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.418
I'm going
to recommend he take it.

40:21.420 --> 40:22.986
And you'd go with him?

40:22.988 --> 40:25.522
We would move to maine, yes.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.894
I appreciate everything
you've done for us.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.896
Do you see what
you're sacrificing by leaving,

40:32.898 --> 40:34.764
By taking ralph away from us?

40:34.766 --> 40:37.167
I have to think of his safety.

40:37.169 --> 40:39.669
Earlier today, you
invoked the greater good

40:39.671 --> 40:41.838
So that I would
team up with cabe.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.807
But do you just throw
that term around?

40:43.809 --> 40:47.043
My son nearly died
because he wants to be you.

40:47.045 --> 40:49.913
Is it so awful being me?
Being around me?

40:49.915 --> 40:51.748
I just don't want him
to become you!

40:54.185 --> 40:56.653
What is your solution?

40:56.655 --> 40:58.721
Keep him in a cocoon?

40:58.723 --> 41:02.091
Have him watch you move to maine
to follow some guy

41:02.093 --> 41:03.893
Who's already abandoned
you? That's idiotic!

41:03.895 --> 41:05.895
That guy is his father, walter.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.231
You are not.
I... I have to go.

41:18.142 --> 41:20.210
Good-bye, guys.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.730
I don't need her.
I don't need cabe.

41:42.132 --> 41:45.034
(engine revving)

41:47.505 --> 41:48.538
(tires squealing)

41:48.540 --> 41:50.573
(engine revving)

42:01.919 --> 42:04.287
Yeah!

42:04.289 --> 42:07.056
(tires squealing)

42:07.058 --> 42:10.059
(engine revving)

42:11.962 --> 42:13.897
(tires squealing)

42:13.899 --> 42:15.565
(engine revving)

42:15.567 --> 42:16.966
Oh, oh!
(tires squealing)

42:18.002 --> 42:19.869
(crashing)

42:19.871 --> 42:22.572
(thudding, glass breaking)

42:22.574 --> 42:24.641
(debris clattering)

42:27.745 --> 42:29.812
(crickets chirping)
