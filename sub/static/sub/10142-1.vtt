WEBVTT

00:08.333 --> 00:09.720
Private.

00:10.998 --> 00:12.243
Fella.

00:14.564 --> 00:16.903
- What's this?
- It's the wanted cards, mate.

00:17.023 --> 00:19.988
Nab one of those faces,
pay-out will set you up for life.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.239
- This one looks like you.
- What?

00:23.904 --> 00:25.790
Cheers, mate.

00:25.825 --> 00:28.401
Christ, six weeks on a bloody ship.
Tell me about it.

00:28.521 --> 00:30.325
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

00:38.919 --> 00:41.678
Gentlemen, do I have your attention?

00:42.159 --> 00:43.220
Kenneth Bratton.

00:43.340 --> 00:47.545
Senior executive of the British
armament firm ATAT Systems

00:47.665 --> 00:50.530
was kidnapped from his Baghdad hotel room
two weeks ago.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.665
But we're not sure whether it's
the Republican Guard behind the kidnapping,

00:53.907 --> 00:55.449
or Militant Baptists.

00:55.569 --> 00:58.661
- So we don't know if we're dealing with
military or terrorists. - Correct.

00:58.781 --> 00:59.945
Understood?

01:00.711 --> 01:01.985
Understood?

01:02.105 --> 01:02.950
Yes, sir.

01:03.070 --> 01:06.686
So when you go in, treat
all and any contact as hostile.

01:06.806 --> 01:08.370
No exceptions.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.738
Captain Collinson from
the Military Intelligence speaks Arabic.

01:13.858 --> 01:16.255
and has embedded contacts in the facility.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.651
So he will accompany you
in the extraction and operate signals.

01:19.771 --> 01:22.382
So what intel do we have on
Bratton's current location?

01:22.873 --> 01:26.751
We've identified this safe house
in an apartment block in Bazra City.

01:26.871 --> 01:30.919
Eyewitness saw a hostage we believe to be
Bratton taken into the building 2 days ago.

01:31.039 --> 01:33.400
- How reliable is this intel?
- A local source.

01:33.416 --> 01:34.555
I'd stake my life on him.

01:34.823 --> 01:36.295
All our lives.

01:42.591 --> 01:45.053
John, you'll command the operation,

01:48.976 --> 01:53.533
Allied military bombardment
we'll begin within the next 24 hours.

01:53.875 --> 01:56.974
So let's get Bratton out before
he becomes collateral damage.

02:03.212 --> 02:05.010
Here. Take mine.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.160
Shove that shit away.

02:07.653 --> 02:11.035
Mission window from drop
to extraction is 5 minutes.

02:11.155 --> 02:14.930
- Thanks. - All other hostage
evacuation protocols are standard.

02:15.050 --> 02:17.972
- Come on, let's move.
- Good hunting, boys.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.656
See you back for breakfast.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.855 --> 02:54.775
- Gentlemen, welcome to the
Socialist Republic of Iraq.

03:09.512 --> 03:12.286
- Land in 60 seconds.
- Get position.

03:22.834 --> 03:29.386
Landing in 6..5..4..3..2..1.

03:29.506 --> 03:31.693
Go, go, go.

03:47.122 --> 03:48.597
Move, move.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.623
Let's call in for backup.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.126
- Kenneth Bratton?
- Yes.

04:23.161 --> 04:25.956
- Keep quiet and do what I say, and you'll
get out of here alive. - On your feet.

04:27.451 --> 04:28.042
Move.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.495
- Grenade!
- Down!

04:47.962 --> 04:50.241
- Go, go, go!
- We got this.

05:06.346 --> 05:10.337
Shoot him! John!
Shoot him!

05:22.182 --> 05:23.682
What's the hold up?

05:30.098 --> 05:31.499
It's ok.

05:32.645 --> 05:33.933
It's ok.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.584
John, what's going on up there?

05:47.175 --> 05:49.311
John, for Christ's sake.

06:11.574 --> 06:13.697
They're round the back!

06:19.728 --> 06:21.837
Fuck! Get Bratton out of here.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.626
You've been hit, John. Go!

06:28.564 --> 06:30.559
Going down.

06:34.578 --> 06:37.069
- Steve, magazine!
- There you go, fella.

06:42.457 --> 06:44.736
Can't let you have all the fun now,
can we?

06:44.856 --> 06:46.689
Yeah, right.

06:47.057 --> 06:50.878
En route with hostage. Get down, down, down!

06:53.538 --> 06:55.363
Let's go.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.939
"John, we need covering fire
to assist."

07:05.940 --> 07:08.379
"Repeat, need covering fire."

07:08.380 --> 07:10.820
Get him out, immediate evac.
On my way.

07:15.820 --> 07:16.780
Fuck.

07:19.780 --> 07:20.740
Shit.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.259
"Need immediate evac assist."

07:24.260 --> 07:26.819
"Evac assist."

07:26.820 --> 07:28.459
Cannot phone location.

07:28.460 --> 07:31.260
Repeat, cannot phone location.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.020
"Collinson, will you get down here?"
On my way.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.379
I haven't got a magazine.
Me too.

07:49.380 --> 07:51.740
Let's get out of here, now.
With you.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.820
Fuck. Steve, Steve!

08:14.540 --> 08:15.700
Porter!

08:17.580 --> 08:19.379
Where are the other men?

08:19.380 --> 08:23.019
Collinson, where's Mike and Keane?

08:23.020 --> 08:24.779
Fuck.
They're dead!

08:24.780 --> 08:28.859
Porter! Porter!

08:33.020 --> 08:35.539
Go, go!

09:15.780 --> 09:17.499
Two men dead.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.219
What the fuck went wrong, Sergeant?

09:20.220 --> 09:23.779
As we returned to the roof
we were intercepted by two,

09:23.780 --> 09:27.259
maybe three units
of Republican Guard.

09:27.260 --> 09:30.340
Mike, Steve -
Porter, this was your command.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.340
It was the kid, wasn't it?

09:39.740 --> 09:42.539
What fucking kid?

09:42.540 --> 09:44.540
There was a...

09:46.460 --> 09:50.059
The men holding Bratton used
this boy as a suicide bomber.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.540
Porter put him out of action.

09:51.541 --> 09:53.099
You shot him?

09:53.100 --> 09:55.540
He had a dead man's trigger,
I couldn't shoot him.

09:55.541 --> 09:56.740
Couldn't?

09:58.300 --> 09:59.659
Or wouldn't?

09:59.660 --> 10:05.379
Porter disarmed the bomb, sir, and
knocked the boy unconscious, but...

10:05.380 --> 10:06.660
But what?

10:10.820 --> 10:15.139
When I returned to the stairwell
he was standing, holding a weapon.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.659
'When he saw me, he ran.'

10:19.660 --> 10:21.499
'But from where he was standing,

10:21.500 --> 10:25.420
he had a perfect firing position
on all three of the men.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.260
Fuck. Steve, Steve!

10:33.580 --> 10:36.139
'I only had time to recover Steve

10:36.140 --> 10:39.020
before the Iraqi guards -
Alright, alright.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.580
Thank you, Collinson. Dismissed.

10:53.220 --> 10:57.220
A clean head shot would have stopped
the reflex release on the button.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.300
You should have killed him, John.

11:13.420 --> 11:14.900
John, I...

11:17.460 --> 11:19.339
John, it wasn't your fault.

11:19.340 --> 11:21.699
What did he say to me?

11:21.700 --> 11:26.939
The kid. The boy that I hit.

11:26.940 --> 11:29.859
What exactly did he say to me?

11:32.020 --> 11:35.059
It's an Arabic saying.

11:35.060 --> 11:37.219
"I lay my life for your sake."

11:37.220 --> 11:40.420
It's a debt of honour.

11:41.340 --> 11:44.180
He owes you his life.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.300
Thank you.

12:02.420 --> 12:06.099
"This was how the end
of an era was heralded."

12:06.100 --> 12:08.979
"The American marines leaving.
After three weeks of war

12:08.980 --> 12:12.779
scenes of jubilation have replaced
fighting and bombing."

12:12.780 --> 12:14.859
"They used to chant for Saddam,

12:14.860 --> 12:17.779
now they are pledging their loyalty
to George W Bush."

12:17.780 --> 12:21.379
"Politicians are beginning to ask
whether the danger was exaggerated,

12:21.380 --> 12:22.780
the intelligence flawed."

12:22.781 --> 12:25.419
"Despite repeated assurances
by the prime minister"

12:25.420 --> 12:28.139
that WMDs will be found in Iraq,

12:28.140 --> 12:31.099
firm evidence of Saddam Hussein's
supposed arsenal

12:31.100 --> 12:33.899
"of chemical and biological weapons
has yet to be found."

12:33.900 --> 12:37.139
Daddy.
Lexie, sweetheart.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.179
Missed you so much.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.539
Careful. I've got metal pins
in that shoulder.

12:41.540 --> 12:44.659
We've been into RHQ every day,
they didn't know where you were,

12:44.660 --> 12:46.739
then they did,
but not how badly hurt.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.379
Home now, though, aren't I?

12:48.380 --> 12:51.219
"It may also be an indication
that the feared threat"

12:51.220 --> 12:53.419
of chemical or biological
retaliation

12:53.420 --> 12:56.499
"may not be as serious
as we'd been led to believe."

12:56.500 --> 12:59.140
"Katie Dartmouth in southern Iraq."

13:09.500 --> 13:11.900
Let's get some of this inside you.

13:19.820 --> 13:22.899
I'm sorry, you are?

13:22.900 --> 13:25.380
I'm his best mate.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.979
So, how's he doing, Doc?

13:31.980 --> 13:35.019
He has bullet fragments
lodged in his brain.

13:35.020 --> 13:38.540
If we try to remove them
we may do more harm than good.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.020
Come in.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.619
Sergeant, I've discussed the
pertinent points of the operation

13:56.620 --> 13:57.659
with the CO.

13:57.660 --> 14:00.859
Do you have anything to say
in defence of your actions?

14:00.860 --> 14:04.939
No, sir, no defence.
That's to your credit.

14:04.940 --> 14:07.580
Hat off, Sergeant.

14:10.660 --> 14:12.779
I'm sorry, mate.

14:12.780 --> 14:15.059
The blokes won't work with you.

14:15.060 --> 14:17.659
I wouldn't work with me.

14:17.660 --> 14:20.699
The boss wants to do this
on medical grounds.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.259
Have you returned to unit.

14:23.260 --> 14:25.619
Sir, I'd rather resign.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.340
'The army can still use you.'

14:29.820 --> 14:32.940
As a bean counter?

14:36.740 --> 14:39.020
'You beat the clock, John.'

14:40.180 --> 14:42.300
'Be grateful for that.'

14:58.620 --> 15:01.419
How is she?
How do you think?

15:01.420 --> 15:04.379
She's worried she's going
to have to leave all her friends.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.340
Didn't you tell her
I was staying local?

15:06.341 --> 15:08.380
She's ten years old.

15:14.900 --> 15:18.859
You know this flat's only for
a little while, don't you?

15:18.860 --> 15:20.140
Budge up.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.739
I'm going to get another job.

15:25.740 --> 15:28.899
Then we'll find somewhere
really nice to live.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.060
But you'll be gone again.

15:33.980 --> 15:36.779
'I'm not going anywhere.'

15:36.780 --> 15:38.100
Promise.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.739
'I know you're a busy man,
Mr Bratton.'

15:43.740 --> 15:45.819
'So I'll get straight to the point.'

15:45.820 --> 15:47.699
'I'm no longer serving in the army

15:47.700 --> 15:53.019
as a result of injuries
sustained in combat.'

15:53.020 --> 15:57.419
And for the past six years
I've served in various -

15:57.420 --> 16:01.619
John, please, you don't need
to sell yourself to me.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.219
I am hearing about a number of
lucrative opportunities in Iraq.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.019
Private security contractors.

16:07.020 --> 16:11.299
I was thinking of something
closer to home.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.419
Look, John, I mean no disrespect,

16:14.420 --> 16:18.300
but all of our recruits
have academic qualifications.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.339
I may have some driving work.

16:23.340 --> 16:26.459
Office security.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.980
Two of my best mates died for you.

16:29.860 --> 16:32.380
Another's crippled for life.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.140
John, please.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.460
Fuck!

16:47.420 --> 16:51.220
Come one step closer
and I will take you down.

16:59.020 --> 17:01.659
'I'll get on the phone,
there'll be something else.'

17:01.660 --> 17:03.540
There was something else
in the army.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.780
I'm trying.
Today, that was trying, was it?

17:12.619 --> 17:14.980
Listen. Listen.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.659
My mum said that she'll have me
and Lexie for a bit.

17:23.660 --> 17:26.339
But we've got the flat.

17:26.339 --> 17:29.380
Just till you get yourself straight.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.420
Yeah?

17:33.100 --> 17:35.180
It's easier that way, isn't it?

17:38.500 --> 17:40.579
I will make this better.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.420
For all of us.

17:44.940 --> 17:47.100
I know you will.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.579
"Major combat operations in Iraq
have ended."

17:56.580 --> 17:58.659
"In the Battle of Iraq,

17:58.660 --> 18:03.019
the United States and our allies
have prevailed."

18:12.300 --> 18:14.339
Seven years
after the invasion,

18:14.340 --> 18:16.099
seven years of bloody occupation,

18:16.100 --> 18:18.819
and the battle for Iraq
is yet to be won.

18:18.820 --> 18:22.259
Life in the streets appears
at least to continue peacefully,

18:22.260 --> 18:26.379
but an undercurrent of violence
hides just beneath the surface.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.059
With the US pull-out scheduled
for the end of the year,

18:29.060 --> 18:32.059
many Iraqis I've spoken to
are worried.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.779
They believe that
hard-line sectarian groups

18:34.780 --> 18:38.619
are preparing to take advantage of
the void created by withdrawal.

18:38.620 --> 18:43.380
Just last month in this market,
a bomb attack...

18:47.980 --> 18:50.779
Erm... a bomb attack...
Cut.

18:50.780 --> 18:52.820
Sorry.
What's up?

18:55.500 --> 18:57.220
You OK? Do it again.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.140
OK, bye.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.219
This doesn't feel right.

19:29.220 --> 19:32.139
What do you mean?
I've seen this guy.

19:32.140 --> 19:33.940
It's the boy from the market.

19:59.180 --> 20:02.379
No, no!

20:02.380 --> 20:04.220
Please!

20:22.260 --> 20:23.820
Sir.

20:25.220 --> 20:28.139
A British TV journalist
has just been abducted near Basra.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.219
Shit. You know who this is,
don't you?

20:30.220 --> 20:32.499
Yeah, we're trying to establish
if her kidnap

20:32.500 --> 20:34.939
is incidental or directly related
to her father.

20:34.940 --> 20:36.819
Any contact?
Not yet.

20:36.820 --> 20:39.939
All we know is that Katie was
abducted 17 kilometres from Basra

20:39.940 --> 20:42.739
near a town called Al Harith.
It's a Sunni district.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.020
Predominantly.

20:45.100 --> 20:48.299
Her film crew were killed on sight.
There were no witnesses.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.779
"Katie Dartmouth
has been reported missing..."

20:50.780 --> 20:52.179
Any means of tracking her?

20:52.180 --> 20:54.620
No. Her mobile was destroyed
so we can't use that.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.859
But she did have the presence of
mind to take a photo with her phone

20:57.860 --> 20:59.859
and SMS it to her office.

20:59.860 --> 21:02.019
Given the time the
picture was taken,

21:02.020 --> 21:04.419
we're pretty certain
it's one of her abductors.

21:04.420 --> 21:07.899
Her producer wants to know
if he can release it to the press.

21:10.900 --> 21:12.420
Sir?

21:13.740 --> 21:15.099
Sir?

21:15.100 --> 21:18.179
Yes, erm... No, hold off.

21:18.180 --> 21:21.459
At least until we've sent it to
Iraqi intelligence and police. OK.

21:21.460 --> 21:24.419
See if they can identify him
before we open it to the public.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.939
"We go live to Patrick
Dartmouth, Katie's father,

21:26.940 --> 21:28.699
and former foreign minister."

21:28.700 --> 21:32.139
"This is very sudden and shocking
news. Katie always knew..."

21:32.140 --> 21:34.180
< Sir? Line one.

21:36.140 --> 21:37.580
"Hugh."
Yes, sir.

21:37.581 --> 21:39.219
"Get over here now."

21:39.220 --> 21:40.900
"Please excuse me."

21:43.380 --> 21:45.739
We set up Section 20
for exactly this kind

21:45.740 --> 21:48.139
of politically delicate incident.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.459
Thanks, Hugh.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.619
Major Collinson heads up the unit.

21:51.620 --> 21:53.019
Sir Patrick.

21:53.020 --> 21:56.539
With Hugh's experience in the field
and specialist Arabic knowledge,

21:56.540 --> 21:58.979
he's uniquely placed
to resolve this situation.

21:58.980 --> 22:02.019
If you find Katie, what can you do?

22:02.020 --> 22:04.699
Section 20 works closely
with UK Special forces.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.699
Once we have a location,
we can start implementing a rescue.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.500
We've got a team on standby. They
can be in Iraq within eight hours.

22:13.820 --> 22:15.980
It's the last resort, sir.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.739
Would an offer of money help?

22:19.740 --> 22:22.220
Not until they make contact.
No, sir.

22:28.420 --> 22:31.540
But we do have a promising lead.

22:32.500 --> 22:35.299
A photograph your daughter took
of one of her abductors.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.659
Clever girl.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.939
So far, Iraqi intelligence
haven't been able to identify him.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.739
I suggest we let the networks
broadcast this image.

22:42.740 --> 22:45.059
Might throw up a local witness.
Offer a reward.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.740
I'm not sure that's the best -
Just do it.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.540
Of course, sir.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.259
"Hello?"

23:45.260 --> 23:47.459
It's me.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.700
"I promised I'd call. Is she there?"
Hold on, John.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.620
It's your dad.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.940
You hardly see him.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.099
Hello.
"How are you, Lexi?"

24:03.100 --> 24:04.460
It's Alex.

24:05.860 --> 24:08.499
Listen, I'm gonna change my shifts.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.619
See if I can come up next weekend.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.020
I'm kind of busy next weekend.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.779
Alright then. Well, another weekend.

24:17.780 --> 24:21.100
We can do something together,
just you and me -

24:23.980 --> 24:26.339
"..Mobile phone
photographed this image

24:26.340 --> 24:29.379
of a policeman approaching
what investigators believe to be

24:29.380 --> 24:31.139
"the vehicle she was in."

24:31.140 --> 24:34.739
"British intelligence authorities
have confirmed that this is likely"

24:34.740 --> 24:36.580
to be the face
of one of her abductors,

24:36.581 --> 24:39.419
"disguised in an Iraqi
police uniform."

24:39.420 --> 24:42.059
"British security forces
believe this photograph,"

24:42.060 --> 24:44.099
taken on Miss Dartmouth's
mobile phone,

24:44.100 --> 24:45.979
"could be one of her abductors."

24:45.980 --> 24:49.099
"It's thought that Katie herself
must have managed to forward

24:49.100 --> 24:52.179
the image to her London office
at the time of the abduction."

24:52.180 --> 24:55.539
Police and intelligence authorities
are asking anyone who thinks

24:55.540 --> 25:01.019
"they might have information
to contact the relevant services."

25:25.620 --> 25:27.140
Salam.

25:33.260 --> 25:36.819
I hope you are here
for only a short time.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.300
And then you will go home.

25:42.580 --> 25:44.299
May I have some water, please?

25:44.300 --> 25:47.179
Of course. You are our guest.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.620
After we have quenched your thirst,

25:51.621 --> 25:53.939
there is something
you must do for us.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.780
Sir, we've just picked up
a Webcast.

25:55.781 --> 25:57.939
It was uploaded
less than ten minutes ago.

25:57.940 --> 26:00.179
Put it up on the big screen.

26:12.100 --> 26:16.579
"We demand the release of our
brother, Mohammed Jassim Ali."

26:16.580 --> 26:19.979
"Unless this holy warrior
is freed..."

26:19.980 --> 26:22.579
..the hostage will be executed...

26:22.580 --> 26:25.939
..at one minute after midnight
on Jumu'ah." That's their Sabbath.

26:25.940 --> 26:28.819
Rewind the tape. Get me a profile
on Mohammed Jassim Ali.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.659
Stop. Check the date on the paper.

26:30.660 --> 26:34.139
Mohammed Jassim Ali is currently
being held in Bellmarsh Prison

26:34.140 --> 26:35.580
under anti-terrorism laws.

26:35.581 --> 26:37.899
They're calling themselves
"Sword of Islam."

26:37.900 --> 26:40.419
What do we know about them?
I'll get a full history.

26:40.420 --> 26:43.419
Trace that IP address,
find out where they're sending from.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.219
Already tracing, sir.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.499
We've got until midnight Friday.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.100
Seven days.

26:50.220 --> 26:53.619
I don't care who you say you are,
you're not coming beyond this point.

26:53.620 --> 26:54.859
Layla, please.

26:54.860 --> 26:57.019
I'm sorry, sir.
The security guard thinks-

26:57.020 --> 27:00.219
It's OK, we're old comrades. John.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.420
Please.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.460
It's just here.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.179
It's him, isn't it?

27:14.180 --> 27:16.459
It looks like him, I grant you.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.339
Come on, the age fits.

27:18.340 --> 27:20.419
He'd be 17/18 by now,
living in that area.

27:20.420 --> 27:22.819
Can't be ten miles
from the Bratton location.

27:22.820 --> 27:25.899
There's been years of war,
thousands of young men have scars.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.139
He is proof of a connection.
With what?

27:28.140 --> 27:30.859
Between Katie's kidnapping
and Bratton's.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.179
Alright, look.

27:33.180 --> 27:36.219
Remember him?
Colonel Hakim Al Naziri.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.779
Former head of security
in Saddam's secret police.

27:38.780 --> 27:40.939
I saw him that night
commanding the attack.

27:40.940 --> 27:44.540
You saw him, John. No-one else.
He was there.

27:45.660 --> 27:48.259
Naziri was never picked up
after the invasion.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.579
Look.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.179
He's suspected of masterminding a
series of attacks on British forces.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.699
Not to mention financing
Baathist Sunni groups,

27:55.700 --> 27:58.059
including the one
this man belongs to.

27:58.060 --> 28:01.219
The man these people are demanding
is released from Bellmarsh.

28:01.220 --> 28:03.379
Where are you going with all this?

28:03.380 --> 28:06.299
If Naziri is Sword of Islam,

28:06.300 --> 28:09.419
they might still be using
the original safe house in Basra.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.499
It's been seven years, John.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.939
Just get me to the safe house.

28:13.940 --> 28:16.979
I can infiltrate the group.

28:16.980 --> 28:18.940
Maybe even get to Scarface.
John...

28:18.941 --> 28:20.260
Look!

28:25.100 --> 28:28.660
Just... let me find him.

28:30.820 --> 28:32.860
Let me find him.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.100
And then you can send in the lads.

28:41.380 --> 28:44.819
You remember what he said to me
that night, don't you?

28:47.860 --> 28:51.340
I lay my life for your sake.

28:52.620 --> 28:55.139
He owes me.

28:55.140 --> 28:58.299
No matter what he did
to Mike and Keith and Steve,

28:58.300 --> 29:02.220
he owes ME a debt of honour.

29:05.220 --> 29:08.099
John, you can't...

29:08.100 --> 29:11.619
..seriously expect me to entertain
this half-baked notion

29:11.620 --> 29:15.500
to satisfy your need for -
I'm not talking about revenge.

29:16.500 --> 29:19.620
I was going to say atonement.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.140
This won't bring them back, John.

29:30.060 --> 29:33.419
But it could get you killed.

29:33.420 --> 29:35.900
Or is that exactly what you want?

30:20.700 --> 30:23.140
Why are you doing this to me?

30:24.900 --> 30:27.260
You are your father's daughter.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.060
He isn't even a minister any more.

30:44.220 --> 30:47.619
200,000 Iraqis died
since the invasion.

30:47.620 --> 30:50.139
And I've always reported the truth.

30:50.140 --> 30:51.820
Always.
Yes.

30:54.340 --> 30:59.740
But your father helped spread
British and American lies.

31:45.980 --> 31:48.539
Sword of Islam
is a Sunni militant group

31:48.540 --> 31:51.579
responsible for a string of bombings
in the Basra area.

31:51.580 --> 31:53.899
Given what we know
about their modus operandi,

31:53.900 --> 31:56.579
the time of the Webcast
and the location of the kidnap,

31:56.580 --> 31:58.579
we believe Katie is being held

31:58.580 --> 32:02.619
somewhere within
this region in southern Iraq.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.859
This must be an area
the size of Wales.

32:04.860 --> 32:07.739
We're trying to pinpoint her
or at least narrow the window

32:07.740 --> 32:09.819
by locating the IP address
of the Webcast.

32:09.820 --> 32:11.660
Shouldn't we have that traced by now?

32:11.661 --> 32:14.499
Yes, but the Webcast was routed
by dozens of servers.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.899
Unfortunately because
we only have one upload,

32:16.900 --> 32:18.939
we can't analyse the back scatter.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.939
So they've been clever?
Very.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.940
Anything else?

32:27.020 --> 32:29.499
Anything at all?

32:29.500 --> 32:31.739
There is one possibility.

32:31.740 --> 32:33.299
Go on.

32:33.300 --> 32:36.579
A former special forces operative
believes there's a connection

32:36.580 --> 32:40.779
between the man Katie Dartmouth
photographed during her abduction

32:40.780 --> 32:43.739
and the Bratton extraction in 2003.

32:43.740 --> 32:46.819
He thinks he may be able
to utilise Scarface as an asset,

32:46.820 --> 32:49.699
but it's a very long shot.

32:49.700 --> 32:54.499
Well, long-shot or not, use him.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.900
Thank you.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.699
Morning, Peter.
Morning, sir.

33:01.700 --> 33:05.299
You didn't think it worth mentioning
that Porter's been off active duty

33:05.300 --> 33:08.659
for eight years, has borderline
post-traumatic stress disorder,

33:08.660 --> 33:10.539
a ten percent weakness in one arm,

33:10.540 --> 33:13.579
and what effectively amounts
to a dishonourable discharge.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.780
Layla, we have nothing.

33:16.940 --> 33:19.900
Tell Porter he's been reactivated.

33:49.010 --> 33:52.769
Have a look at the cards
and tell me what they remind you of.

33:52.770 --> 33:54.090
A vagina.

34:05.850 --> 34:07.530
A vagina.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.290
Er...

34:16.210 --> 34:17.730
A vagina.

34:29.290 --> 34:31.489
I'll work harder.
I'm not going to blow this.

34:31.489 --> 34:33.208
Chances are this is all academic.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.009
Katie's dad has kicked up
enough of a fuss in Westminster

34:36.010 --> 34:39.168
for the Prime Minister
to authorise an offer via the Swiss.

34:39.170 --> 34:41.849
They have a go-between apparently.

34:41.850 --> 34:44.409
A ransom?
Yeah.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.089
It's all deniable, of course.

34:46.090 --> 34:48.449
But Katie goes free
and Ali stays inside.

34:48.449 --> 34:51.409
Hakim is not just some insurgent.
He's a strategist.

34:51.409 --> 34:54.409
Hakim Al Naziri. Your pet theory.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.688
For which there's absolutely
zero evidence.

34:56.690 --> 35:00.009
But if I'm right,
and Hakim has joined the zealots,

35:00.010 --> 35:01.850
that ransom could be a provocation.

35:01.851 --> 35:05.250
Thank you, Porter.
I'll put that in a memo.

35:09.850 --> 35:12.249
How are you feeling this evening,
Sergeant?

35:12.250 --> 35:14.569
Absolutely bloody knackered,
Sergeant.

35:14.570 --> 35:19.649
Well, getting a body into shape in
a matter of days... it's gonna hurt.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.010
Are you saying I'm not in shape?
No, no. I'm...

35:26.090 --> 35:29.049
Erm, how is your tooth?
Sore.

35:29.050 --> 35:32.369
I know. The tracker is like having
a very uncomfortable filling.

35:32.370 --> 35:34.889
But we need to know where you are
at all times.

35:34.890 --> 35:37.890
You could have just asked
for my mobile number.

35:41.490 --> 35:44.050
Here's something for the pain.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.770
There's a good boy.
Oh, I'm a very good boy.

35:53.170 --> 35:58.250
Well, then I think...
you probably...

36:00.010 --> 36:02.570
..deserve a bit of a treat,
don't you?

36:19.890 --> 36:22.529
If only there was another way.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.449
Forgive me.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.289
No. No. No!

36:27.290 --> 36:28.849
No! No!

36:28.850 --> 36:32.409
Sir, they are responding
to the ransom offer.

36:36.650 --> 36:38.569
Oh fuck.

36:38.570 --> 36:40.049
No. No.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.769
"The British do not believe
we are committed to our cause."

36:46.770 --> 36:50.730
"They think we crave...
their blood money."

36:52.250 --> 36:54.130
No! No!

36:57.730 --> 36:59.610
Jesus Christ.

37:12.290 --> 37:13.650
Yes?

37:15.570 --> 37:17.209
I'll tell him right away.

37:17.210 --> 37:19.050
They fucked up,
it was a live Webcast.

37:19.051 --> 37:21.849
So we can track their IP address?
Pinpoint the location?

37:21.850 --> 37:24.289
Yes. 24 hours max.
Get yourself back to Hereford.

37:24.290 --> 37:26.729
I want the team airborne to Basra
and ready to move

37:26.730 --> 37:28.650
the moment we get a location.
I'm on it.

37:28.651 --> 37:31.049
Priority task.
Standby for IP address.

37:31.050 --> 37:32.849
We've got the bastards.

37:32.850 --> 37:35.089
We'll take a C-130
to Basra Air Station.

37:35.090 --> 37:37.809
Ferguson's group
will be designated Alpha Team.

37:37.810 --> 37:40.449
We'll be deployed in a standby
at the US base in Basra,

37:40.450 --> 37:42.290
to be used only in the event
of contact

37:42.291 --> 37:44.089
between Alpha Team and Scarface.

37:44.090 --> 37:45.889
So, I get to be B Team.

37:45.890 --> 37:48.409
I think you're lucky to be
that far up the alphabet.

37:48.410 --> 37:50.569
I'd settle for an R
and you can call me Romeo.

37:50.570 --> 37:54.049
Oh yes, the nurse. Danni is
a special operative for Section 20.

37:54.050 --> 37:57.409
Her remit includes honey traps and
so forth. She was assigned to you

37:57.410 --> 38:01.249
after the psychologist diagnosed
mission limiting self-esteem issues.

38:01.250 --> 38:05.849
Compounded by a fixation
on physical and sexual inadequacy.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.809
In layman's team, you needed a shag.

38:08.810 --> 38:11.010
You're driving.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.049
Hello, lads.

38:27.050 --> 38:29.489
..Location is 35 clicks
around Basra,

38:29.490 --> 38:33.250
possibly up to the north-west.
Then once we've...

38:34.770 --> 38:36.529
Do you need something, Porter?

38:36.530 --> 38:39.409
No. No, I was just wondering
if you might need my services.

38:39.410 --> 38:43.010
We're kind of having a private
operational discussion here, pal.

38:46.570 --> 38:48.290
Sorry, mate.

38:50.890 --> 38:53.569
Listen, I need a favour
from someone in the motor pool.

38:53.570 --> 38:56.329
Anybody got any connections?
Yeah, this way.

38:56.330 --> 38:57.770
Thanks.

39:02.330 --> 39:04.529
Sir, we have a location. Al Khalifa.

39:04.530 --> 39:06.369
Put it on the screen, Sergeant.

39:06.370 --> 39:09.089
Coordinates 30 degrees,
50 minutes,.50 north.

39:09.090 --> 39:12.649
47 degrees, 31 minutes,.46 east.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.610
Call Layla. Prepare Alpha Team.

39:21.170 --> 39:24.970
See you later. They found her.
35 clicks from Basra.

39:59.450 --> 40:02.769
"This is 2-8 Alpha.
Crossing now, over."

40:02.770 --> 40:04.649
Time to target, 17 seconds.

40:04.650 --> 40:07.610
> Confirm.
Final line crossed at 19-17.

40:10.090 --> 40:13.369
"We are on the start line.
Good to go at your command."

40:13.370 --> 40:16.490
They are in position, sir.
It's your call.

40:20.610 --> 40:23.370
I've done a terrible thing to you.

40:25.570 --> 40:29.690
But consider the blood of ours
that has been spilt.

40:31.650 --> 40:34.410
Is it worth less than yours?

40:36.810 --> 40:38.889
"We're good to go, sir."

40:38.890 --> 40:40.450
Let's do it.

40:42.090 --> 40:44.529
Go, go, go.
"Roger that, moving now."

40:44.530 --> 40:48.250
"Found target. 2-8 Alfa landing now."

40:51.210 --> 40:53.169
Go, go, go.

40:53.170 --> 40:55.810
Get out! Troops disembarking.

41:15.330 --> 41:17.370
Keep it tight, guys.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.530
"Alpha Team entering building now."

41:27.650 --> 41:33.489
We will change your dressing.
We will treat you with respect.

41:33.490 --> 41:37.409
But if your government
does not set our brother free,

41:37.410 --> 41:39.570
we will kill you.

41:54.850 --> 41:57.170
Steady, lads. Steady.

41:59.330 --> 42:01.010
There's a door ahead.

42:05.450 --> 42:07.530
"Approaching door now."

42:11.250 --> 42:13.130
"OK, blow it."

42:19.090 --> 42:20.329
Go, go, go!

42:20.330 --> 42:24.289
"There's someone here."
"Katie? Miss Dartmouth?"

42:24.290 --> 42:25.370
Katie?

42:26.810 --> 42:29.049
Shit.

42:32.730 --> 42:34.729
> Repeat, lost comms, sir.

42:34.730 --> 42:37.169
Alpha Team, come in.
Layla, we just lost signal.

42:37.170 --> 42:40.249
> Alpha Team, please respond.
Layla, what just happened?

42:40.250 --> 42:43.049
Alpha Team, this is section 20.
Lieutenant, report!

42:43.050 --> 42:45.129
Oh my God, Fergie!

42:45.130 --> 42:48.249
"The entire building
has just gone up, sir."

42:48.250 --> 42:50.049
"I can't see them."

42:50.050 --> 42:52.410
"I can't see Alpha Team."

43:26.530 --> 43:30.289
"John, where are you going
with all this?"

43:30.290 --> 43:33.329
If Naziri is Sword of Islam,

43:33.330 --> 43:37.409
they might still be using
the original safe house in Basra.

43:37.410 --> 43:40.249
"Just get me to the safe house."

43:40.250 --> 43:43.169
"I can infiltrate the group."

43:43.170 --> 43:45.650
"Maybe even get to Scarface."
