WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:01.547
Woo-hoo!

00:01.558 --> 00:03.905
Previously on Californication...

00:04.025 --> 00:07.800
- You'd seriously pay...
- A million dollars to be inside of you again.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.969
-  That is fucked up.
- I know!

00:10.000 --> 00:12.390
- You're not gonna do it, are you?
- I don't know yet.

00:12.421 --> 00:14.000
We could really use the cash.

00:14.021 --> 00:15.663
I'm on my way. How about you?

00:15.783 --> 00:17.684
I will be. Shortly.

00:17.694 --> 00:19.483
- 30 minutes or less.
- Oh, Hank.

00:19.483 --> 00:21.988
I don't want to wait
for what already promises

00:21.989 --> 00:23.958
to be a pretty unpleasant conversation.

00:23.959 --> 00:25.452
I just got to see you smile,

00:25.452 --> 00:27.399
before you go home, okay? One time?

00:27.431 --> 00:29.326
I can't make any promises.

00:29.357 --> 00:31.389
A drink with Karen...
what's that all about?

00:31.420 --> 00:33.031
Everything is so fucking crazy right now,

00:33.041 --> 00:35.483
I don't feel like I can make
the right move to save my life,

00:35.494 --> 00:36.821
and she centers me.

00:36.842 --> 00:37.842
Hank, shut up and listen to me.

00:37.873 --> 00:39.926
I got to try to get
through this without crying.

00:39.958 --> 00:42.610
I'm... at the hospital.

00:42.730 --> 00:45.526
Karen was in a car accident.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:33.291 --> 01:34.624
What the fuck is wrong with me?

01:34.659 --> 01:37.060
Why couldn't I have been on time?

01:37.095 --> 01:38.795
Don't blame yourself, Hanky.

01:38.863 --> 01:40.263
Why not?

01:40.298 --> 01:43.133
She was going to meet me.

01:43.167 --> 01:45.502
Yeah, the guy was drunk.
He came out of nowhere.

01:45.536 --> 01:47.104
It could have happened anytime, anyplace.

01:47.138 --> 01:48.072
Yeah, you know how many times

01:48.080 --> 01:49.452
I've driven around Venice fucked up?

01:49.455 --> 01:50.956
It could've been me behind the wheel.

01:51.309 --> 01:52.643
Yeah, maybe so.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.378
But that shit doesn't matter now.

01:54.412 --> 01:56.547
This is where we are,
and she's gonna be okay.

01:56.581 --> 01:58.215
You don't know that.

01:58.249 --> 02:01.051
How is she?

02:01.086 --> 02:03.087
Some fucking drunk broadsided her.

02:03.121 --> 02:05.089
She got pretty knocked around.

02:05.123 --> 02:06.557
She's in and out of consciousness.

02:06.591 --> 02:09.092
There might be some internal bleeding.

02:09.127 --> 02:11.528
What can I do?

02:11.563 --> 02:13.797
You can stop crying, for one.

02:13.832 --> 02:15.499
I can do that.

02:15.533 --> 02:18.502
I'm doing that...

02:18.536 --> 02:19.970
Right now.

02:20.004 --> 02:23.340
Okay, and you maybe
could donate some blood.

02:23.374 --> 02:24.575
She may need some.

02:27.145 --> 02:28.746
Is there something else...

02:28.780 --> 02:31.982
I can do?

02:32.016 --> 02:33.684
Historically, I've been known

02:33.718 --> 02:35.152
to get a little bit woozy

02:35.186 --> 02:37.856
when it comes to the giving of blood.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.691
Maybe I won't be the right type.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.126
Ow!

02:42.160 --> 02:44.528
I'm not a fucking pincushion, woman!

02:44.562 --> 02:46.430
I didn't go in yet.

02:46.464 --> 02:47.998
Really?

02:48.032 --> 02:49.633
You got to be kidding me.

02:49.667 --> 02:52.269
It seemed like I felt every
inch of that thing going in.

02:52.303 --> 02:57.174
Now. Now it's going in.

02:57.208 --> 02:58.709
Ha!

02:58.743 --> 03:02.045
You're a sensitive one, ain't ya?

03:02.080 --> 03:05.149
He's a fucking ninny, is what he is.

03:05.183 --> 03:08.352
Woman was a fucking butcher, Hank.

03:10.622 --> 03:12.222
Hey, how are you doing, buddy?

03:12.257 --> 03:14.391
You hanging in there?

03:14.425 --> 03:17.361
'Cause I'm here to help.

03:17.395 --> 03:19.163
I feel a little woozy, though.

03:31.810 --> 03:33.577
You know, fuck this!

03:33.611 --> 03:35.612
Fuck, Karen. What are you doing?

03:35.647 --> 03:38.182
Why are you being such
an asshole about this?

03:38.216 --> 03:39.516
I'm actually trying very hard

03:39.551 --> 03:41.385
to be the opposite of an asshole.

03:41.419 --> 03:43.387
Well, you know what? You're
not doing a very good job.

03:43.421 --> 03:44.721
You're the one who brought it up,

03:44.756 --> 03:46.156
about me being a fucking asshole.

03:46.191 --> 03:47.758
Yeah, well, because you're making it

03:47.792 --> 03:49.193
so fucking obvious that
you don't want to go.

03:49.227 --> 03:51.228
Oh, really? How can you tell?

03:51.262 --> 03:53.530
Is it because I've said
it out loud many times?

03:53.565 --> 03:55.032
Yet here I am, going
where I don't want to go.

03:55.066 --> 03:56.700
You know, don't do me any favors, okay?

03:56.734 --> 03:59.002
Because it's just our entire
fucking future at stake.

03:59.037 --> 04:01.004
Jesus Christ, with the drama, Karen.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.539
Do you know how many times

04:02.574 --> 04:04.007
I've had to reschedule this appointment?

04:04.042 --> 04:05.342
Do you know how many times

04:05.376 --> 04:06.677
I've put my fist through a wall about it?

04:06.711 --> 04:07.744
No, you know, I lost count.

04:07.779 --> 04:09.046
- But you could ask Becca.
- Nice.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.614
Bring Becca into it.

04:10.648 --> 04:12.249
Well, why shouldn't I bring Becca into it?

04:12.283 --> 04:14.184
Isn't she the most
important part of all this?

04:14.219 --> 04:15.886
Isn't she the reason we should
be trying to fix this shit?

04:15.920 --> 04:17.464
Don't fuck with my shit, woman.

04:21.349 --> 04:23.817
Have I always been such an asshole?

04:23.851 --> 04:26.687
Different varieties of asshole.

04:26.721 --> 04:30.691
Some more pernicious than others.

04:30.725 --> 04:33.727
What the fuck happened to us?

04:33.761 --> 04:35.295
What do you mean?

04:35.330 --> 04:36.897
We were always... we were so great.

04:36.931 --> 04:40.767
You know, we'd go out to
dinner every other night.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.971
I could've sworn we were
gonna grow old together.

04:44.005 --> 04:46.974
And now look at us.

04:47.008 --> 04:48.442
We're still together.

04:48.476 --> 04:51.411
Yeah. Yeah, you guys are really together.

04:51.446 --> 04:53.046
You're so together you're contemplating

04:53.081 --> 04:54.815
letting the love of your
life fuck some other guy

04:54.849 --> 04:56.183
for fun and profit.

04:56.217 --> 04:58.752
Hey, Marcy's her own woman, Hank.

04:58.786 --> 05:00.187
- I can't tell her what to do.
- Yeah, you can.

05:00.221 --> 05:02.222
You can fight against that shit, Runks.

05:02.256 --> 05:03.924
Why did you tell him about Stu's offer?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.225
Is nothing private, Runkle?

05:05.259 --> 05:06.860
He's my best friend.

05:06.894 --> 05:08.161
I needed his counsel.

05:08.196 --> 05:09.830
It's a unique situation.

05:09.864 --> 05:11.798
- You didn't tell Karen?
- No!

05:11.833 --> 05:14.067
She would totally frown upon that shit.

05:14.102 --> 05:15.669
Right, she would,

05:15.703 --> 05:18.705
because she's a sane and responsible adult.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.374
She always had a way of centering us.

05:20.408 --> 05:22.009
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me,

05:22.043 --> 05:23.443
and I fucked it up again
and again and again.

05:23.478 --> 05:26.279
- Hank.
- No, it's true, Marcy.

05:26.314 --> 05:27.948
You know, instead of celebrating

05:27.982 --> 05:31.418
the fact that I was the
luckiest guy on earth...

05:31.512 --> 05:32.979
I just pushed her away,

05:33.014 --> 05:34.781
figuring there'd always
be time to work it out.

05:34.849 --> 05:36.950
- There is time.
- No, what if there isn't?

05:36.984 --> 05:38.618
What if... what if this is it, you know?

05:38.653 --> 05:41.655
What if we ran out of time?

05:41.689 --> 05:44.858
You can't go through with this Stu thing.

05:44.892 --> 05:47.360
You'll never get over it.

05:47.395 --> 05:52.165
There's some things you
should never get over.

06:03.878 --> 06:06.346
That him?

06:06.380 --> 06:07.714
Hank.

06:07.748 --> 06:09.516
"Hank," what? It's a simple question.

06:09.550 --> 06:11.118
Save it for in there.

06:11.152 --> 06:12.886
I can't believe

06:12.920 --> 06:14.855
I let you talk me into
humiliating myself like this.

06:14.889 --> 06:16.790
I'm out of here.

06:16.824 --> 06:17.958
Hey, guys.

06:17.992 --> 06:19.960
Welcome.

06:19.994 --> 06:22.295
Hi.

06:27.668 --> 06:29.736
Let's dive in, shall we?

06:29.770 --> 06:34.708
- Yeah.
- What brings you to me?

06:34.742 --> 06:37.310
She's having an affair.

06:37.345 --> 06:39.312
- Diving right in, indeed.
- Jesus, Hank.

06:39.347 --> 06:40.847
Well, that's why we're here, right?

06:40.882 --> 06:42.182
To cut through the bullshit,

06:42.216 --> 06:43.350
get right to the heart of the matter?

06:43.384 --> 06:45.218
That's what I'm trying to do.

06:45.253 --> 06:46.553
That's not the heart of the matter.

06:46.587 --> 06:48.021
It's the heart of the matter to me.

06:48.055 --> 06:49.956
It's... it's what matters to my heart.

06:49.991 --> 06:51.725
- It's the heart of my matter.
- Karen's right, Hank.

06:51.759 --> 06:53.193
Wh... why did I know

06:53.227 --> 06:54.895
that you were gonna side
with her immediately?

06:54.929 --> 06:56.763
No, no, no. No sides here.

06:56.797 --> 06:58.832
I'm just suggesting

06:58.866 --> 07:01.306
that affairs are typically a symptom

07:01.307 --> 07:03.207
- of a larger problem.
- Really?

07:03.211 --> 07:05.605
Well, it seems like a
pretty big fucking problem

07:05.640 --> 07:06.920
in and of itself to me.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.410
So let's hear from Karen.

07:10.444 --> 07:12.078
Are you having an affair, Karen?

07:12.146 --> 07:14.581
No, I wouldn't call it that.

07:14.615 --> 07:16.783
How would you describe it?

07:16.817 --> 07:18.952
Um...

07:18.986 --> 07:21.454
- He's a friend.
- An emotional friend?

07:21.489 --> 07:22.856
I suppose.

07:22.890 --> 07:25.392
Holy shit, Karen. An emotional friend?

07:25.426 --> 07:26.927
I want an emotional friend.

07:26.961 --> 07:29.095
Where do I get an emotional friend?

07:29.163 --> 07:32.766
You had one.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.968
Have you made love with him?

07:35.002 --> 07:36.570
No.

07:36.604 --> 07:40.941
But you've considered it?

07:40.975 --> 07:42.108
Yeah.

07:42.183 --> 07:44.317
I'm gonna punch a wall.

07:44.352 --> 07:46.319
What's the sex like between the two of you?

07:46.354 --> 07:49.022
- Infrequent.
- Nonexistent.

07:49.056 --> 07:51.358
Hank, why do you think...

07:51.392 --> 07:53.627
Karen has developed an emotional bond

07:53.661 --> 07:56.029
with another man?

07:56.063 --> 07:59.266
Maybe because the guy in question is...

07:59.300 --> 08:03.536
Bill his name is... fucking dial tone.

08:03.571 --> 08:05.839
He thinks she's hot,
and he wants to fuck her.

08:05.873 --> 08:07.207
So he pretends to be interested

08:07.241 --> 08:08.441
in everything she's interested in

08:08.476 --> 08:09.876
so he can get into her knickers,

08:09.910 --> 08:11.544
which works, trust me.

08:11.579 --> 08:13.980
- You know, it's really hard...
- With Karen, it works.

08:14.015 --> 08:14.981
To have a meaningful conversation...

08:15.049 --> 08:16.283
That's how you do it.

08:16.317 --> 08:17.250
With someone who drinks himself

08:17.285 --> 08:18.852
into a stupor every night.

08:18.886 --> 08:20.654
I don't see what's wrong with a nightcap.

08:20.688 --> 08:23.290
- Are you a big drinker, Hank?
- What? Is this an intervention?

08:23.324 --> 08:25.392
Do you consider yourself an alcoholic?

08:25.459 --> 08:27.160
I thought we were here

08:27.194 --> 08:28.828
to talk about her emotional friend?

08:28.863 --> 08:31.231
And all we're doing is talking about me.

08:31.265 --> 08:33.533
What are you willing to
change about yourself?

08:33.567 --> 08:35.467
- Why is this all about me?
- It's not.

08:35.503 --> 08:37.904
You just seem the most
defensive at the moment.

08:37.938 --> 08:40.539
Oh, don't smirk, Karen. It's unbecoming.

08:40.573 --> 08:43.176
You know what's really unbecoming?

08:43.210 --> 08:45.245
Is the fact that we don't talk anymore,

08:45.279 --> 08:47.480
the fact that you bury
yourself in your work,

08:47.515 --> 08:49.382
and you go out every night.

08:49.417 --> 08:51.184
- Drinking and flirting.
- Karen.

08:51.218 --> 08:53.286
And you... you come home totally wasted.

08:53.321 --> 08:54.688
You never, ever see your daughter.

08:54.722 --> 08:56.690
- I have a movie in production.
- You are...

08:56.724 --> 08:58.224
- It's a big fucking deal.
- So what?

08:58.292 --> 08:59.859
Some significant others
would be proud of that.

08:59.894 --> 09:01.661
Everyone's got a fucking
movie in production.

09:01.696 --> 09:04.064
Oh, I'm proud of that.
That's not the problem.

09:04.098 --> 09:05.198
So you show your pride by going out

09:05.232 --> 09:06.700
and finding an emotional friend.

09:06.734 --> 09:07.934
And you seem to want to take advantage

09:07.968 --> 09:10.370
of your newfound station in life,

09:10.404 --> 09:12.605
and you resent having a
ball and chain at home.

09:12.606 --> 09:13.943
No, I've never... I don't speak like that.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.329
- I've never put it that way.
- That's kind of what you mean.

09:15.336 --> 09:16.956
- No, I don't.
- But that's what you think.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.913
Do I cross paths with
attractive women? Yes.

09:19.947 --> 09:22.515
Do I flirt with them? I suppose.

09:22.550 --> 09:23.550
Do I want to fuck them?

09:23.584 --> 09:25.118
- Yes!
- Right?

09:25.152 --> 09:28.021
Welcome to the wonderful
world of being a fucking guy!

09:28.055 --> 09:29.055
Why is it a guy thing?

09:29.090 --> 09:30.390
But I don't walk around

09:30.424 --> 09:32.092
trying to make them emotional friends

09:32.126 --> 09:34.928
or considering actually
fucking them all day long.

09:34.962 --> 09:36.930
- You just sa... you did.
- Actually.

09:36.964 --> 09:39.099
Jesus Christ, that is so gross.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.967
I want to punch myself in the dick,

09:41.001 --> 09:42.535
but I'm not going to,

09:42.570 --> 09:45.805
'cause that would be inappropriate.

09:50.244 --> 09:52.078
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, man!

09:52.113 --> 09:53.847
It's only a dollar, man!

09:53.881 --> 09:56.182
Here, I'll give you another one, you know.

09:56.217 --> 09:57.617
Knock it off. You know, try again.

09:57.651 --> 09:59.119
You don't even have to pay me back.

09:59.153 --> 10:01.988
Sorry. I don't know what came over me.

10:02.022 --> 10:04.257
Hey, you know, it's okay, I get it.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.960
I've done it myself many times.

10:06.994 --> 10:10.597
Maybe not so much swearing, though.

10:10.631 --> 10:14.100
- Yeah.
- Are you waiting on some news?

10:14.135 --> 10:18.004
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah, yeah, man. You bet.

10:18.038 --> 10:22.242
My wife, she's in surgery... cancer.

10:22.276 --> 10:23.877
We've seen the inside of this place

10:23.911 --> 10:25.311
a lot the last couple of years.

10:25.379 --> 10:27.013
I'm sorry.

10:27.047 --> 10:29.649
My... my lady's back there, too, somewhere.

10:29.683 --> 10:32.652
Well, they say waiting is the hardest part.

10:32.686 --> 10:36.189
Truer words have never been spoken or sung.

10:36.223 --> 10:38.925
- How long you been married?
- Not married.

10:38.993 --> 10:42.028
Just together on and off forever, really.

10:42.062 --> 10:44.264
We just... we weren't on the best of terms

10:44.298 --> 10:45.765
when this happened.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.334
Hey, man, I've been married 44 years.

10:48.402 --> 10:50.937
And you're not always gonna
be on the best of terms.

10:50.971 --> 10:52.172
44 years.

10:52.206 --> 10:53.673
Well done, sir.

10:53.707 --> 10:55.608
You know... well, you know, it takes time.

10:55.643 --> 10:57.310
But once you get on the other side

10:57.344 --> 10:59.512
of all the bullshit, you realize

10:59.547 --> 11:02.215
that this is what it's all about all along,

11:02.249 --> 11:04.651
you know, having a friend to hold your hand

11:04.685 --> 11:06.486
while life kicks you in the ass

11:06.520 --> 11:08.188
and reminds you that that body of yours

11:08.222 --> 11:10.990
is just on loan.

11:11.025 --> 11:14.294
Yeah, sometimes you see
things really clearly,

11:14.328 --> 11:16.563
and then just... it gets cloudy again.

11:16.597 --> 11:18.231
Hey, well, that's life, kid.

11:18.265 --> 11:20.700
I mean, if it was easy,
we wouldn't never fuck up.

11:20.734 --> 11:24.337
We wouldn't have any regrets,
we'd have perfect kids,

11:24.371 --> 11:26.873
and we'd spend every second
of every day being happy.

11:26.907 --> 11:28.374
Now, you know anybody like that?

11:28.442 --> 11:31.077
No, 'cause I sure the hell don't.

11:31.111 --> 11:35.849
You know, you take it easy on this thing.

11:47.061 --> 11:49.662
A boy called me "weird" today.

11:49.697 --> 11:51.097
You are weird.

11:51.131 --> 11:53.433
- Bad weird?
- Beautiful weird.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.535
And I will totally kick that boy's butt

11:55.569 --> 11:58.104
- if you want me to.
- No.

11:58.138 --> 12:00.907
- He's kind of cute.
- Gross.

12:00.941 --> 12:02.675
You are way too young to say such things.

12:02.710 --> 12:06.746
It seems like boys and girls
make the world go around.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.281
Not only are you beautiful weird,

12:08.315 --> 12:10.149
but you're also wicked smart.

12:10.184 --> 12:13.052
I've made a pretty decent living
writing about boys and girls.

12:13.087 --> 12:15.688
Speaking of boys and girls...

12:15.723 --> 12:17.223
Yes?

12:17.291 --> 12:19.292
Are you and mom going to get a divorce?

12:19.326 --> 12:21.728
How can we get divorced?
We're not even married.

12:21.762 --> 12:23.162
You know what I mean.

12:23.197 --> 12:24.430
I do.

12:24.465 --> 12:26.099
Not if I can help it, baby girl.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.101
You can help it.

12:28.135 --> 12:30.370
- Yeah?
- By not fighting so much.

12:30.404 --> 12:32.105
I'm sorry.

12:32.139 --> 12:33.907
But it's weird.

12:33.941 --> 12:36.776
Other times you guys seem like
you really love each other,

12:36.810 --> 12:38.177
like in the movies.

12:38.212 --> 12:40.413
It's not like in the movies.

12:40.447 --> 12:41.848
What about TV?

12:41.916 --> 12:45.285
No, not TV or movies.

12:45.319 --> 12:48.588
Mommies and daddies have
their work cut out for them.

12:48.622 --> 12:50.924
I don't see why it's so hard.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.659
I'm glad you don't.

12:52.693 --> 12:54.994
You got plenty of time
to learn that lesson.

12:55.029 --> 12:59.132
I don't understand why you
guys get so mad at each other.

12:59.166 --> 13:02.335
How many times are you
going to punch the wall?

13:04.872 --> 13:07.040
I'm not going to do that anymore.

13:07.074 --> 13:10.143
- You promise?
- I promise.

13:10.177 --> 13:11.878
You know why else?

13:11.946 --> 13:15.148
'Cause it really hurts.

13:15.182 --> 13:17.150
Race you home?

13:17.184 --> 13:20.753
Race you home.

13:30.197 --> 13:33.399
Poor Hanky.

13:33.434 --> 13:36.970
This really puts it
all in perspective, huh?

13:37.004 --> 13:39.772
How do you mean?

13:39.807 --> 13:43.309
We've been obsessed
with all the wrong stuff.

13:43.344 --> 13:46.212
You know, the only thing that matters

13:46.246 --> 13:48.314
is that you're healthy,

13:48.382 --> 13:49.983
you're okay,

13:50.017 --> 13:52.986
and you're right here next to me right now.

13:55.022 --> 13:58.458
You're right, Runks, but
we got to go home sometime,

13:58.492 --> 14:00.193
and we're still gonna need money.

14:00.227 --> 14:01.694
You know what I mean?

14:01.729 --> 14:04.197
There has got to be a better way.

14:04.231 --> 14:07.200
And we'll find it, I promise.

14:07.234 --> 14:09.202
Okay.

14:09.236 --> 14:12.405
Yeah.

14:12.439 --> 14:15.041
This kind of thing does put
everything into perspective.

14:15.075 --> 14:16.876
I mean...

14:16.910 --> 14:20.847
Why the fuck do we make
such a big deal out of sex?

14:20.881 --> 14:22.649
If that was you in there right now,

14:22.683 --> 14:25.051
I wouldn't give a shit if
you spanked your secretary

14:25.085 --> 14:26.686
or fucked the nanny.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.388
It all just melts away.

14:28.422 --> 14:31.157
I only care that you're okay.

14:31.225 --> 14:33.726
Do you know what I mean?

14:33.761 --> 14:35.194
Yeah.

14:35.229 --> 14:38.064
I mean, if I had been more understanding

14:38.098 --> 14:40.333
of the fact that you got
some serious kink in you,

14:40.367 --> 14:42.568
then we never would have
fallen down this rabbit hole

14:42.636 --> 14:44.170
- to begin with.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:44.204 --> 14:47.040
But I should have been
able to control myself.

14:47.074 --> 14:50.243
Yeah, but like it or not,
it's just the way we're wired.

14:50.277 --> 14:54.180
If some hot, young thing
asks you to spank her,

14:54.214 --> 14:55.748
you're gonna get a fucking boner.

14:55.783 --> 14:57.417
You're gonna fucking jerk off to it.

14:57.451 --> 15:01.854
It is just the law of the fucking jungle.

15:01.889 --> 15:04.857
I really hate that you're
making so much sense right now.

15:04.892 --> 15:07.794
I know. It's so annoying, right?

15:07.828 --> 15:10.430
I mean, like, if Stu texted me

15:10.464 --> 15:13.299
a picture of his ween right now,
I'd probably get a little wet.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.235
But that is purely out of reflex.

15:16.270 --> 15:17.570
I didn't need that, Marcy.

15:17.604 --> 15:20.973
But it's true, right?

15:21.008 --> 15:25.778
I mean, we all have things
that trigger our arousal,

15:25.813 --> 15:31.084
and if we just acknowledge them
as normal and not deny them,

15:31.118 --> 15:35.254
then we could just move
the fuck on with our lives!

15:35.289 --> 15:37.190
Oh, Jesus, Runkle.

15:37.224 --> 15:39.092
Look alive, Runks.

16:05.586 --> 16:08.087
Well, that was a... that was
a really positive experience.

16:08.122 --> 16:09.522
I feel really good

16:09.556 --> 16:11.290
about the state of our
relationship right now.

16:11.325 --> 16:12.925
Says the guy who put
his fist through a wall.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.460
Do not be changing my shit, woman.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.129
Oh, Hank, don't be such a child.

16:16.163 --> 16:17.830
Don't be such a fucking nag!

16:17.865 --> 16:20.933
You know what? Don't
put me in that box, okay?

16:20.968 --> 16:22.769
Just because you refuse to grow up,

16:22.803 --> 16:24.971
it does not turn me into a nag.

16:25.005 --> 16:27.440
God, Hank, you're so fucking selfish.

16:27.474 --> 16:29.942
I mean, everything revolves
around you, you know?

16:29.977 --> 16:32.512
It's all about what you
will do, what you won't do.

16:32.546 --> 16:34.213
It's... it's this is your life,

16:34.248 --> 16:36.048
and we're just all these
supporting characters in it.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.283
Yeah, and look who's giving

16:37.351 --> 16:38.818
the performance of a lifetime right now.

16:38.852 --> 16:40.553
You know, I don't want to do this anymore.

16:40.587 --> 16:42.355
It's so fucking miserable.

16:42.389 --> 16:44.624
It is fucking miserable.

16:55.836 --> 16:56.969
Fuck me.

17:13.353 --> 17:15.354
You okay?

17:15.388 --> 17:17.190
- I'm fine.
- Sorry about that.

17:17.223 --> 17:19.325
Me too.

17:19.358 --> 17:22.161
We could've fucking died back there, Karen.

17:22.195 --> 17:25.198
- Pretty much.
- 'Cause of your taste in music.

17:27.467 --> 17:30.036
We weren't fighting over music, Hank.

17:30.070 --> 17:33.506
I know, but it all just
seems so silly now...

17:33.540 --> 17:37.143
- All of it.
- I know.

17:37.211 --> 17:39.412
Where did we go wrong?

17:39.446 --> 17:42.014
We were perfect once.
I would swear to that.

17:42.049 --> 17:44.784
We've been in it a while. We have a child.

17:44.818 --> 17:46.452
We're not special.

17:46.486 --> 17:50.223
I mean, I know your writer's
brain wants to make us

17:50.257 --> 17:52.358
into some love story of
the ages or something.

17:52.426 --> 17:54.427
- 'Cause we are.
- Maybe, maybe.

17:54.461 --> 17:56.462
But we still need to work at it, you know,

17:56.496 --> 17:58.764
just like the rest of the world.

17:58.832 --> 18:01.734
It's not gonna figure itself out.

18:01.768 --> 18:04.403
We need to...

18:04.438 --> 18:05.905
I don't know... it's been a long time

18:05.939 --> 18:08.040
since it was just about fiery sex.

18:08.075 --> 18:09.442
Yeah.

18:09.476 --> 18:11.944
It was never just about fiery sex, Karen.

18:16.016 --> 18:17.750
The sex was pretty
fiery, though, wasn't it?

18:17.784 --> 18:19.752
I don't want to talk about sex.

18:19.786 --> 18:21.587
I... I... I kind of do.

18:21.655 --> 18:24.257
Isn't that what we're talking
about, is a compromise?

18:24.291 --> 18:26.893
- Shut up.
- And kiss you? Done.

18:26.927 --> 18:28.761
Done.

18:35.102 --> 18:37.270
Help.

19:28.021 --> 19:29.488
Hello.

19:29.523 --> 19:31.857
Hi... Sister?

19:31.925 --> 19:33.192
What brings you in?

19:33.226 --> 19:36.128
My wife was in a car accident.

19:36.163 --> 19:37.530
I'm very sorry.

19:37.564 --> 19:39.498
Is she going to be okay?

19:39.533 --> 19:43.135
Don't know... now.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.538
Are you a religious person?

19:45.572 --> 19:47.006
Not really,

19:47.040 --> 19:49.508
which is weird, because I often dream

19:49.543 --> 19:51.043
about being in a place like this,

19:51.078 --> 19:53.546
but in... in real life, not so much.

19:53.580 --> 19:57.049
Is there anything I can do for you?

19:57.084 --> 19:58.384
Would you like to talk?

19:58.418 --> 20:00.086
No, I... I'm good.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.253
I was just kind of looking

20:01.288 --> 20:03.689
for a new place to sit and wait.

20:03.724 --> 20:07.760
Are you of any particular faith?

20:07.794 --> 20:08.995
I'm a writer.

20:09.029 --> 20:11.063
So I believe in sitting down,

20:11.098 --> 20:13.499
shutting my eyes, and hoping for the best.

20:13.533 --> 20:17.003
But beyond that, I... not really, no.

20:17.037 --> 20:18.270
Well, that sounds like

20:18.305 --> 20:20.106
a pretty good definition of prayer to me.

20:20.173 --> 20:21.907
Sister, I don't... I don't
think the man upstairs

20:21.942 --> 20:23.743
would be too interested in hearing from me.

20:23.777 --> 20:26.512
I've been a particularly wayward son.

20:26.546 --> 20:28.581
- Everyone says that.
- No, no, no.

20:28.615 --> 20:30.216
I'm a blasphemous mess.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.685
If there's a top ten most unwanted list

20:32.719 --> 20:35.287
up there, I... I could very well be on it.

20:35.322 --> 20:37.590
Maybe so.

20:37.624 --> 20:41.360
But right now you just seem
like a man who loves his wife.

20:41.395 --> 20:43.562
I do.

20:43.597 --> 20:46.365
I really do. And...

20:46.400 --> 20:49.502
I mean, we're not even married.
You know, we... we live in sin.

20:50.804 --> 20:52.204
We had a child together, broke up,

20:52.239 --> 20:54.607
got back together, broke up,

20:54.641 --> 20:56.242
lather, rinse, repeat, you know.

20:56.276 --> 20:58.144
You really are a wayward son.

20:58.178 --> 20:59.645
I told you.

20:59.679 --> 21:02.748
You're very pleasant, Sister...

21:02.783 --> 21:04.283
very agreeable.

21:04.317 --> 21:05.818
Yeah.

21:05.852 --> 21:06.952
Sit.

21:06.987 --> 21:08.754
Close your eyes.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.423
Hope for the best.

21:28.875 --> 21:31.577
That's what I'm talking about.

21:31.611 --> 21:33.646
We just made the fuck, woman.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.981
No, I'm gonna amend that.

21:36.049 --> 21:38.784
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say we made some love.

21:38.819 --> 21:41.253
And you know how much I hate that phrase.

21:41.288 --> 21:43.022
But we made that shit.

21:43.056 --> 21:45.758
We made that shit right here
in our own little private Idaho

21:45.792 --> 21:48.060
of sin and sex juices and...

21:48.095 --> 21:49.662
Okay, are you finished?

21:49.696 --> 21:50.996
I could go on for hours.

21:51.031 --> 21:53.299
I've just started.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.468
Do you think it's possible?

21:55.502 --> 21:56.869
To go again?

21:56.903 --> 21:59.872
Yeah, just... just give
me five minutes or...

21:59.906 --> 22:01.273
Four.

22:01.308 --> 22:03.042
No, actually, I'm ready to go now.

22:03.076 --> 22:04.510
- Let's do...
- No, no, no.

22:04.544 --> 22:07.346
Do you think it's possible, you know,

22:07.380 --> 22:10.149
happily ever after?

22:10.183 --> 22:11.951
Yeah, baby.

22:11.985 --> 22:13.953
Just think.

22:13.987 --> 22:16.655
We got to bottle this
feeling and bust it out

22:16.690 --> 22:19.825
every time things get a little cloudy.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.794
Yeah, 'cause that really works, right?

22:21.828 --> 22:24.396
Couples who have great sex...

22:24.431 --> 22:27.032
they always make it to the finish line.

22:27.067 --> 22:29.135
Do they?

22:29.169 --> 22:30.736
We're gonna make it, Karen.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.705
How do you know?

22:34.808 --> 22:36.976
'Cause I love you to death.

22:37.010 --> 22:39.912
- Really?
- I'm sure of that.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.618
I love you too.

22:48.455 --> 22:50.523
Come here.

22:55.729 --> 22:57.663
You ready?

22:57.697 --> 23:00.232
Yes.

23:04.671 --> 23:08.007
- Excuse me, Doctor.
- Yeah, in a minute.

23:08.041 --> 23:12.778
Hey, hey.

23:12.812 --> 23:14.346
She has a concussion.

23:14.381 --> 23:15.948
Oh, Jesus!

23:15.982 --> 23:17.683
But there's no internal bleeding.

23:17.751 --> 23:20.085
She'll be here for a couple days, but...

23:20.153 --> 23:22.221
she's a very lucky girl.

23:22.255 --> 23:24.356
Oh, my God.

23:24.391 --> 23:26.225
Thank God. Thank God.

23:26.259 --> 23:27.359
Can we see her?

23:27.394 --> 23:29.028
One of you can go back.

23:29.062 --> 23:30.729
Are you the husband?

23:30.764 --> 23:34.066
Yes. Yes, he's the fucking husband.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.769
Go see your fucking wife.

23:36.803 --> 23:39.104
This way.

23:39.172 --> 23:42.608
Oh, my God.

23:42.642 --> 23:44.577
Honey.

23:47.981 --> 23:49.882
Oh. No.

23:49.916 --> 23:51.850
- Not here.
- Not here? Okay. Okay.

24:22.048 --> 24:25.751
This doesn't change anything, you know.

24:25.819 --> 24:29.188
I'm still pissed at you.

24:29.222 --> 24:31.624
I wouldn't have it any other way.

25:02.489 --> 25:04.857
Hello, sir.

25:04.891 --> 25:06.392
Finally.

25:06.426 --> 25:08.594
I interviewed a new assistant today.

25:08.628 --> 25:09.995
What was wrong with the old one?

25:10.030 --> 25:11.463
Well, the agency caught him

25:11.498 --> 25:13.899
looking at porn on the computer.

25:13.933 --> 25:15.334
- Oh, gross.
- Oh, is that a crime now?

25:15.368 --> 25:16.902
Maybe they were afraid

25:16.936 --> 25:18.637
he was beating off at work... I don't know.

25:18.672 --> 25:20.839
Oh, that's fucking foul, Charlie.

25:20.874 --> 25:23.709
Jerking off at work... save
that shit for the shower.

25:23.743 --> 25:26.378
Ah, I do not like to
stand up and masturbate.

25:28.081 --> 25:29.481
Looking down, seeing my own belly,

25:29.516 --> 25:31.216
it takes me out of the game.

25:31.251 --> 25:32.818
Looking down and seeing
your great white underbelly

25:32.852 --> 25:34.153
would take me out of the game too.

25:34.187 --> 25:35.587
It's understandable.

25:35.622 --> 25:38.424
And yet, I love to sit down when I pee.

25:38.458 --> 25:40.225
What do you think about that, Karen?

25:40.260 --> 25:42.561
Hey, hey, guy or girl assistant?

25:42.595 --> 25:44.496
Ooh, gi-i-i-rl.

25:44.531 --> 25:47.399
She's got funky hair,
Hank, and tattoos all over.

25:47.434 --> 25:49.835
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you be careful, Runks.

25:49.869 --> 25:51.270
Don't go dipping your
helmet into that shit.

25:51.304 --> 25:52.338
I'll bite it off.

25:52.372 --> 25:54.073
Trust me, I will.

25:54.107 --> 25:56.408
And you can't afford to
lose an inch off that thing.

25:56.443 --> 25:58.744
I trust you, Marcella.

25:58.778 --> 26:00.846
Okay.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.614
Hey, we've been trying to get you guys

26:02.649 --> 26:04.283
out on the town for weeks.

26:04.317 --> 26:05.918
What gives? Why now? Why?

26:05.952 --> 26:09.054
Hello? Hello?

26:09.089 --> 26:12.725
Nothing. Just some days
you see everything clearly.

26:12.759 --> 26:14.526
We almost died today.

26:14.561 --> 26:17.062
And then we went home and
fucked each other's brains out,

26:17.130 --> 26:18.864
which put us in a pretty good mood.

26:18.932 --> 26:21.033
And gave us an appetite.

26:21.067 --> 26:23.669
How many times a week do you guys fuck?

26:23.737 --> 26:25.971
Because Runks and I are starting to slump.

26:26.005 --> 26:27.039
Hey, now.

26:27.073 --> 26:28.707
What? It's true.

26:28.742 --> 26:30.309
Karenina, you don't think

26:30.343 --> 26:32.044
I'm starting to go
through the change, do you?

26:32.078 --> 26:32.643
- Because...
- Starting?

26:32.645 --> 26:35.214
- I still get really wet.
- Yes, yes, you do.

26:35.248 --> 26:37.316
I think that's what makes me pop so fast.

26:37.350 --> 26:39.985
You see, this is why we don't go out,

26:40.019 --> 26:42.454
because every time we
do, Charlie says something

26:42.489 --> 26:44.291
that makes me throw up in my mouth.

26:44.337 --> 26:45.704
She started it.

26:45.739 --> 26:47.606
Hey, well, try living with that shit

26:47.641 --> 26:50.242
try living with that shit. I didn't.

26:50.277 --> 26:52.845
You think we'll be doing
this years from now?

26:52.939 --> 26:54.473
Why wouldn't we be?

26:54.508 --> 26:56.876
We're the best friends
in the whole wide world.

26:56.910 --> 26:59.812
We have got tons more
business to do, my friend.

26:59.846 --> 27:02.248
We are not done taking this town by storm.

27:02.315 --> 27:04.850
I'm not sure if this town
is done taking us by storm...

27:04.885 --> 27:06.218
From behind...

27:06.253 --> 27:09.155
- Always.
- Not so much as a reach-around.

27:09.189 --> 27:11.557
Boys and girls...

27:11.591 --> 27:13.058
Oh, we're cheers-ing.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.054
To hard cocks, wet pussies,

27:15.088 --> 27:18.424
bald heads, smurfs, and
weathering the storm.

27:19.859 --> 27:21.160
L'Chaim.

27:21.194 --> 27:22.928
- Are you Jewish?
- Gesundheit.

27:22.963 --> 27:24.797
I'm not sure if it's the whiskey talking,

27:24.831 --> 27:26.799
but I fucking love you guys.

27:26.833 --> 27:30.236
I fucking love you too.

27:30.270 --> 27:31.604
Especially you.

27:35.775 --> 27:38.844
- They're doing it.
- Aw. You should kiss me now.

27:38.878 --> 27:40.946
- We're kissing.
- So we have to.

27:41.014 --> 27:43.849
Mm.

27:43.883 --> 27:46.685
That's good salad dressing.
