Sorry.

Hello! Is this
the garrick residence?

00:41.809 --> 00:44.909
- It is.
- I've been invited to a party.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.213
- Miss vivienne!
Lovely to see you again.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.816
- Roth. Bertie isn't
expecting me.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.584
- No matter.
Do come in.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.556
And your name is?
- Mary!

00:57.625 --> 01:00.759
- Oh, jackie!
- Oh, I'm so happy you came!

01:02.096 --> 01:04.496
This is
my oldest chum, roth.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.299
Oh, come in and meet everyone!

01:18.946 --> 01:21.379
- Haha! What do you have
in mind?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.583
- That depends. What time

Chep webley. Webley insurance.

"when life goes wrong,
we make it right."

02:16.904 --> 02:18.970
- We are not in the market
for any insurance, mr. Webley.

02:19.006 --> 02:22.373
- This isn't a sales call.
- In that case, trudy clarke.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.042
How can I help you?
- I have a problem.

02:24.044 --> 02:27.312
My in-house investigator
recently up and died.
- I'm so sorry.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.881
You need us to look into
the circumstances of his death?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.983
- Oh, goodness, no. He drowned
on holiday with his family.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.786
- How awful!
- Well, fortunately for him,

02:34.822 --> 02:36.854
He was well compensated
while he was alive,

02:36.891 --> 02:39.925
And he had a very handsome
life-insurance policy,

02:39.927 --> 02:42.327
Courtesy of webley insurance,
for afterwards.

02:42.462 --> 02:44.762
- Well, that's a blessing.
- For them!

02:45.999 --> 02:48.333
But now I have to hire
a replacement investigator.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.569
And in the meantime, I have
a new claim that I don't like,

02:50.571 --> 02:52.604
Not one bit.
- (trudy): Well, we can

02:52.606 --> 02:54.472
Certainly help you. Why don't
you tell me all about it.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.341
- (webley): Perhaps I should
speak with mr. Drake

02:56.377 --> 02:59.010
Directly.
- Do we have any whisky?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.552
- And that is?

03:07.588 --> 03:11.290
- Frankie drake! She's
the best detective in town.

03:11.292 --> 03:15.093
- Well, I'm afraid I need
a... Professional.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.763
- Mr. Webley,
we'll take your case

03:18.799 --> 03:20.765
On one condition.
We'll solve it

03:20.801 --> 03:23.835
To your satisfaction,
and when we do,

03:23.904 --> 03:26.838
You contract us for
all your investigative needs.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.707
- Miss clarke,
this is not a game.

03:28.842 --> 03:32.677
- Oh, I know. You give us
the case, we'll solve it.

03:35.015 --> 03:35.913
- Very well.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.783
Now, this doesn't
look like much,

03:38.819 --> 03:40.185
But this bottle of wine,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.321
It's worth $30,000.
- Oh, that's

03:43.357 --> 03:44.956
Amazing.
- Yes.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.192
Well, yesterday, it was stolen
from the garrick

03:47.261 --> 03:49.127
Family wine cellar.

03:49.196 --> 03:50.862
And if the webley insurance
company is to avoid

03:50.931 --> 03:53.865
Paying a hefty claim,
well, this bottle must

03:53.934 --> 03:55.533
Be found.
- There was a party

03:55.603 --> 03:57.535
At the garrick house yesterday.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.071
My guess is one of the guests
took the wine.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.607
Lucky for you, we have
an operative on the inside.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.777
- (trudy): Mary.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.814
We get you the wine,
and you contract this firm

04:09.850 --> 04:12.951
For all of webley insurance's
investigations.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.419
Deal?

04:18.559 --> 04:22.027

04:22.096 --> 04:24.162

04:57.064 --> 04:58.796
- Can you believe it?

04:58.832 --> 05:00.465
All the most fabulous people
in the city.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.267
To be honest, I didn't even
think they'd let me in.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.268
- Why did they?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.271
Have you heard about
these three flapper girls

05:06.273 --> 05:08.339
Who have taken high society
by storm this season?

05:08.375 --> 05:11.543
- Sure, they're in all the
society papers. Very voguish.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.978
-<i> The star</i> calls them
the daybreak girls.

05:14.048 --> 05:17.282
- 'cause they party until dawn.
- (frankie): Who doesn't?

05:17.284 --> 05:19.217
- Well, people have to be
at work in the morning.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.620
- One of them just became
a model for eaton's cosmetics.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.022
- And without any modelling
experience. Just because she
was seen in these society pages.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.359
- That's lena.
- How did you get in
with these girls, mary?

05:27.494 --> 05:30.062
- So, my old friend jackie

05:30.197 --> 05:32.431
Is one of the daybreak girls!

05:32.433 --> 05:34.366
She's thick as thieves
with lena

05:34.368 --> 05:35.500
And katrina.
- That's not

05:35.635 --> 05:37.435
Usually your kind of scene.
- Well, no,

05:37.471 --> 05:39.604
Not at all,
but it's been ages

05:39.606 --> 05:41.039
Since jackie's called me,
and I didn't want to reject

05:41.041 --> 05:43.308
Her invitation.
- I hope you made the most

05:43.443 --> 05:45.910
Of it while you were there.
- You're darn tootin' I did!

05:45.946 --> 05:48.213
I had three glasses
of champagne, the real stuff.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.415
(woman chuckling)
<i> now, this was meant to be</i>

05:50.451 --> 05:52.117
<i>A salon, so I was doing my best</i>

05:52.119 --> 05:53.785
<i> To keep up</i>
<i> with the conversation.</i>

05:53.821 --> 05:56.988
<i>There were so many interesting</i>
<i> people there to talk to.</i>

05:57.057 --> 06:00.392
<i>It was... It was difficult to</i>
<i>decide who to speak with next.</i>

06:00.394 --> 06:02.861
- It reminds me of a frock
which was featured

06:02.863 --> 06:05.130
At the marthe callot
opening in paris.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.032
- Come to my apartment tomorrow,
you can read it for yourself.

06:09.103 --> 06:12.204
- Less kind.
More of an imposition really.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.739
- You wound me.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.276
- Oh! Ah! I'm so...
I beg your pardon.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.944
(flo laughing)
- well, were you there

06:20.013 --> 06:22.280
When the wine was stolen?
- Yes. Yes, I was.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.149
- (man): Help!
-<i> I had a front-row seat.</i>

06:25.486 --> 06:28.820
- Search the house!
The lafitte has been stolen!

06:28.822 --> 06:31.622
- (mary):<i> Bertie garrick was</i>
<i> beside himself.</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:34.625
But it turns out the lafitte
is the prize centrepiece

06:34.661 --> 06:36.561
Of bertie's father's collection.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.797
- I'm guessing
mr. Garrick wasn't very pleased.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.766
- Well, no.
They're travelling of course.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.834
So now, bertie's terrified
they're gonna come home,

06:42.969 --> 06:45.770
Blame him, cut off
his entire allowance.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.572
- Fate worse than death.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.975
Did you see
any likely suspects?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.109
- No.
- Three glasses of champagne

06:52.146 --> 06:54.779
Might have had something
to do with that.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.648
- Maybe we should go to
the house and try to figure out

06:56.717 --> 06:58.249
How they did it.
- Stealing a bottle of wine

06:58.285 --> 07:00.051
That expensive is only
the first part.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.186
The second is figuring out
how to sell it, and that can

07:02.222 --> 07:04.456
Be trickier. There can't be
many black-market wine sellers

07:04.525 --> 07:07.459
Out there with clients
able to afford the lafitte.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.995
- Flo, what about that liquor
fence that you dated last year?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.799
- Hmm! We parted on good terms.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.937
- You really finessed
mr. Webley this morning.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.472
- "chep webley,
webley insurance.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.340
When things go wrong,
we make it right."

07:22.342 --> 07:24.009
- I'm really looking forward
to turning down that contract

07:24.144 --> 07:26.044
When we get it.
- But wait a minute, frankie.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.814
Could be some steady income.
- Steady sounds boring.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.748
And besides, we do ok.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.550
- Steady income means
you could take

07:32.619 --> 07:35.820
More cases that interest you,
even if they don't pay.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.422
- Well, now you're
finessing me.

07:37.557 --> 07:40.225
(trudy chuckling)
♪♪

07:40.227 --> 07:42.961
- Chep webley sent you, you say?

07:42.963 --> 07:46.498
I must admit I'm surprised.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.033
- Well, apparently,
your butler, mr. Ummm...

07:49.069 --> 07:50.902
- Roth.
- Right.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.838
Apparently,
mr. Roth wired your father

07:53.907 --> 07:55.307
And he filed
a claim immediately.

07:55.442 --> 07:58.309
- Uh, my father knows,
does he?

07:58.345 --> 08:00.045
- Mr. Roth didn't mention
that he was in touch

08:00.180 --> 08:01.979
With your father?
- No, well... Well, I think

08:02.015 --> 08:05.183
He's a smidge upset
with me just now.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.184
- Why don't you show us
to your wine cellar.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.920
- Roth has the only key.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.789
- (trudy): Is it true you're
the only one that has a key

08:10.791 --> 08:13.525
To the wine cellar, mr. Roth?
- Yes.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.326
I feel I must assure you

08:15.362 --> 08:16.994
I have been
in the garricks' employ

08:17.030 --> 08:19.797
Since before master bertram
was born.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.334
The garricks
trust me implicitly.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.070
- Still, a very valuable bottle.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.807
- Money can't buy back
integrity once lost.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.142
- Is it possible someone took
the key without you knowing?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.011
- When not in my possession,

08:33.146 --> 08:34.880
The keys are locked
in the safe

08:35.015 --> 08:37.482
To which only
the senior mr. Garrick and I

08:37.617 --> 08:39.551
Know the combination.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.753
Every night
without fail.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.021
- So you didn't let
anyone other than bertie in

08:44.057 --> 08:46.958
To the cellar yesterday?
- Correct.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.094
- So, how did the thief
get down here?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.095
- That I can't answer.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.966
- That will be all, roth.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.572
- You're sure that the wine
was here before the party?

09:00.707 --> 09:03.041
- Yes. Absolutely positive.
I came down

09:03.110 --> 09:05.510
To fetch a case of champagne
before the first guests arrived.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.378
The lafitte was
in its place here.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.980
- Oh, please,
don't disturb the scene.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.616
- What time did you notice
that it was missing?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.718
- Right about 10 exactly.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.055
More or less. I came down
to replenish the champagne.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.658
It was quite a good little party
before all this.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.460
The daybreak girls
were here, you know.

09:22.462 --> 09:25.063
- And the cellar was locked?
- It always is. Roth...

09:25.132 --> 09:27.465
Let me in to fetch
the champagne

09:27.501 --> 09:31.536
And locked up after me.
He's... Particular about that.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.571
- The dust on the rest
of the bottles is undisturbed.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.608
- Oh. Well, how mortifying.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.943
Yes, I see.
I... I will have roth

09:39.012 --> 09:41.813
Down to clean.
- No. I think that she's saying

09:41.882 --> 09:44.415
The thief didn't touch
any of the other bottles.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.351
- Whoever took the bottle
knew exactly where the wine was.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.421
- Did any of the guests
know about the lafitte?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.455
- Uh, no, no.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.357
Well, digby knew.

09:53.393 --> 09:55.760
Father showed him when
he first acquired the bottle,

09:55.762 --> 09:58.696
But I myself
never said a word.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.433
Father strictly advised me
not to discuss it.

10:01.568 --> 10:05.236
Looking back, I suppose to avoid
just this eventuality.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.671
- We're gonna need
a list of all the guests

10:06.806 --> 10:08.306
That were at the party
last night.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.511
- Well, it would have been
easy enough to hide

10:13.580 --> 10:15.713
A bottle of wine
under a coat and walk out.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.648
- And none the wiser.
- You go find digby;

10:17.684 --> 10:20.118
I'm gonna talk to flo's fence.
- Ok.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.254
- I was happy
to hear from you, flo.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.922
Only fond memories
of our time together.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.925
- Oh, my memories
are fond too, mickey,

10:27.060 --> 10:29.193
But my call was
purely business. Ah!

10:30.430 --> 10:32.931
Mickey, this is frankie drake.
- Nice to meet you.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.332
- Likewise.
- We sure could help your help

10:34.467 --> 10:36.067
On this one.
- As much as I'd like to help

10:36.103 --> 10:37.602
Flo and any friend of hers,

10:37.737 --> 10:40.338
If I get a shot
at a genuine lafitte,

10:40.473 --> 10:42.707
Oooh-wheee!

10:42.709 --> 10:45.643
Gotta be honest, my cut
would be too good to pass up.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.813
- So what if we can get
the insurance company
to pay your cut?

10:50.751 --> 10:53.284
- That sounds fair.
- Ok. So you'll let us know

10:53.353 --> 10:55.086
If anyone comes asking
about the wine.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.454
- Of course. Yes, ma'am.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.489
- Well, you are as good of a guy
as flo told me.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.892
- I never lie about men.
Or taxes. Haha!

11:01.928 --> 11:03.828
- One last thing, I wouldn't
mind shaking some trees,

11:03.963 --> 11:05.429
So if any of your customers
haven't heard

11:05.465 --> 11:07.031
Of the lafitte, maybe you want
to mention that it's

11:07.034 --> 11:08.433
On the market.
- And see who gets excited?

11:08.568 --> 11:09.867
- You got it.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.304
Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.839
- Aw, mickey.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.574
- Ah, flo,

11:16.643 --> 11:19.177
It was reward enough
just seeing your face.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.712
But if you don't want it.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.251
(tramway bell ringing)

11:30.257 --> 11:33.091
- You didn't see anything?
- The champagne was flowing.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.393
A particularly pleasant vintage.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.062
So by mid-evening,
the world of the party

11:38.098 --> 11:41.132
Began to spin around me
as though I were the sun.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.202
That's quite good, isn't it?

11:44.337 --> 11:45.937
- You felt drunk?
- Well, yes,

11:46.006 --> 11:48.073
But this is
so much more evocative.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.508
"the world of the party."

11:50.544 --> 11:52.076
- Are you telling me
you left early, mr. Digby?

11:53.447 --> 11:55.412
- As though I were the sun.
- Look, you're the only guest

11:55.449 --> 11:57.181
That knew that the lafitte
was in the cellar.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.951
- Well, now, hold on.
I was passed out in the tub

12:00.020 --> 12:02.620
From 9 o'clock onwards.
Any witnesses who used

12:02.656 --> 12:04.489
The facilities
can attest to the fact.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.357
- Well, you could have still
slid down to the cellar.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.559
- In my condition?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.829
Besides, I wasn't the only one
who knew. There's vivienne.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.231
- Who?
- Well, she and bertie
were affianced for years.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.367
She was as close
with the garrick family as I,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.169
And mr. Garrick loves
to talk about the lafitte.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.705
- Do you think she's capable
of stealing the wine?

12:20.774 --> 12:22.240
- Well, she's putting up
a brave front,

12:22.309 --> 12:24.642
But she's quite put out
that bertie ended things.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.644
And what about
those flapper girls?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.713
- The daybreak girls knew
about the wine too?

12:28.848 --> 12:30.815
- What, bertie didn't tell you?

12:30.817 --> 12:32.516
He showed it off
to them himself.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.120
- Thanks.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.993
- None of this.
- Two coffees only.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.261
-<i> Merci.</i>

12:43.330 --> 12:45.330
- I didn't realize you were
in the wine cellar

12:45.465 --> 12:48.199
Yourself, jackie.
- Oh, yes.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.468
About an hour
after you arrived.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.536
- Oh.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.138
- You know,
that stocks-and-bonds fellow

12:53.273 --> 12:55.740
Was talking your ear off;
are you sure he wasn't

12:55.875 --> 12:57.908
Flirting?
- Jackie! No!

12:57.944 --> 12:59.610
He was trying
to get me to invest.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.345
As if I have
a spare thousand dollars

13:01.381 --> 13:04.849
Just lying about. Ugh!
(jackie laughing)

13:07.354 --> 13:09.487
- You know... I know

13:09.622 --> 13:12.089
This crowd is different
from our school chums,

13:12.125 --> 13:15.727
But I have missed you, mary.
Quite a lot.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.862
- I've missed you too.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.165
- I really like
lena and kat too.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.569
You know, for once in my life,
I feel like I'm

13:24.571 --> 13:27.038
Finally having fun

13:27.040 --> 13:28.439
And worrying about
no one but myself.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.109
- Well, after all the work
you did to support the family

13:31.244 --> 13:33.278
After your father died,

13:33.413 --> 13:35.380
I think
you deserve this.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.782
- Ah, if the girls would just
accept you into the group,

13:37.917 --> 13:40.585
I know that we could see
a lot more of each other.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.520
- They're both so sophisticated.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.522
- They're charming girls,
I swear it,

13:44.524 --> 13:47.458
But very selective.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.128
- I see.
- And you saw the wine?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.597
- Yes. Bertie showed us
the lafitte.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.466
- (european accent): My family
has three bottles at the chalet.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.934
- We had to pretend

13:56.970 --> 13:59.804
To be impressed.
- It was boring.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.539
Like this.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.476
- Aren't you the new face
for eaton's cosmetics?

14:05.612 --> 14:08.813
- Exactly. So as you can see,

14:08.815 --> 14:10.681
None of us have
to steal a thing

14:10.717 --> 14:13.684
To get ahead. All we need
are good looks and charm...

14:14.754 --> 14:15.887
...Which we have in spades.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.956
- What about bertie's ex,
vivienne?

14:18.091 --> 14:21.659
- How would we know? She's
certainly not one of us. Ta-ta.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.828
- Hmm... Ta-ta.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.065
- Jackie.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.572
- They should serve cakes.
- It's quaint, though.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.775
- I'll go look for vivienne.
- Ok.

14:37.844 --> 14:41.178
I'll go see a guy about
an overpriced bottle of wine.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.448
- Bertie garrick broke it off
with you, and you showed up
at his party.

14:43.583 --> 14:46.517
- I wanted everybody to know
I don't give a toss.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.452
- Maybe you want to see
if there is another woman?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.654
- Within a week?
No woman in the city

14:50.690 --> 14:52.390
Would dare cross me
like that.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.058
- Listen, no one will hold it
against you

14:54.127 --> 14:55.927
If you're just trying
to pull off a prank.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.997
- Is bertie sweating it?
Ah, I did hope he would.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.230
- What? You have it?

15:00.267 --> 15:03.600
- Promise me he suffers
before you give it back.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.738
I found it
on the walk outside.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.007
Looks like
a spare key

15:09.009 --> 15:11.876
To the wine cellar to me.
I assume bertie lost it.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.011
- Bertie said
he didn't have a key.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.347
- He would say that.
Roth would be furious

15:16.482 --> 15:18.583
If he knew.
- How do I know you didn't use

15:18.585 --> 15:20.551
This key to steal the wine?
(vivienne scoffing)

15:20.553 --> 15:22.620
- Because that would
be ridiculous.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.823
Besides, I was home
in my bed by 9.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.492
Our maid servants
will tell you.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.464
- It's a distinctive key,
mr. Bird; remember cutting it?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.101
- Yes. Four-sided.

15:37.236 --> 15:39.037
Not common.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.105
- You remember anything about
that customer who had this made?

15:41.174 --> 15:44.509
- Sure do. Placed the order
then stayed an extra 20 minutes

15:44.511 --> 15:46.310
To disparage the ending
of the book I was reading.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.447
Considered himself
something of a writer.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.115
- Tall, fluffy blond hair?

15:51.151 --> 15:54.052
- That's him. That's the man
who spoiled my book.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.052
- Thank you.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.959
A month ago,
you made a duplicate key

16:01.094 --> 16:03.594
Of the garrick wine cellar.
- You waited for a party

16:03.596 --> 16:06.330
At bertie's, so there'd be
other suspects and then
you made your move.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.266
- Asking me in here
just to accuse me,

16:08.268 --> 16:11.069
Quite frankly,
it hurts my feelings.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.603
- You want to tell us
where you stashed the lafitte

16:12.605 --> 16:15.005
Or do you want
to go to the police?
- Now, now,

16:15.041 --> 16:17.474
Let's not get ahead
of the plot here.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.814
I have a taste
for fine wine.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.483
Occasionally, I help
myself to something
in the garrick's cellar,

16:26.519 --> 16:28.553
But never the lafitte.
- (trudy): Someone used the key

16:28.688 --> 16:31.422
To take the lafitte.
- Well, it wasn't me.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.058
I lost the key
the night of the party.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.293
Anyone could have taken it
out of my jacket pocket

16:36.329 --> 16:37.828
While I was sleeping
in the tub.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.797
- So who do you think
it was?

16:39.932 --> 16:42.366
- I have a theory.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.637
- I don't want to.
- Mary...

16:46.639 --> 16:49.907
- Frankie, those girls
have been very nice to me,

16:49.909 --> 16:51.509
And now you want me
to spy on them?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.877
- They might be nice, but
they might also be criminals.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.647
- I would really like

16:56.783 --> 16:59.450
These girls to like me,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.252
Which is really
a long shot.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.221
And if they catch me
spying on them...

17:03.223 --> 17:05.790
- You have nothing to worry
about, mary. Just be yourself.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.859
- The trick is to not care
one bit whether or not

17:07.994 --> 17:11.328
They like you.
- Well, I can't do
both of those things, can I?

17:11.398 --> 17:13.730
I can't be myself and not care
what anyone thinks.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.733
That doesn't make any sense.
- Girls, I have news.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.236
- Do tell.
- There's an underground auction

17:19.238 --> 17:21.939
Of rare liquor.
Mickey says that's the place

17:22.008 --> 17:24.575
Where the thief
will get the best price.
- But where's the auction?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.077
- Mickey knows
a guy who knows a guy.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.079
- Well, let's go!
- It's very exclusive.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.181
It's almost impossible
to get an invitation.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.483
It's run by a guy
named rhodes.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.952
- Leo rhodes?
- Mhm.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.020
- Well, we don't want
to steal wine from him;

17:36.089 --> 17:37.755
We'll end up
in the harbour or worse.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.823
- Looks like we gotta find
that wine before the auction.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.259
- Seems like
we're on a deadline.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.370
Ask for the owner and say you're
interested in the auction.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.305
- How do I know
about this auction?

17:54.374 --> 17:56.440
- You're european,
you know everything.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.641
- Hahaha!

17:57.677 --> 17:59.510
I'm very pleased
that you called me.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.579
I expect helping you
with one of your cases

18:01.581 --> 18:03.181
Will allow me
to see the real frankie.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.116
- We've known each other
for months.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.453
-<i> Si, va bene,</i> but you don't
like to reveal yourself.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.856
Here, I can see what you are
most passionate about.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.824
Then I better
understand you.

18:18.397 --> 18:21.031
♪♪

18:28.808 --> 18:29.807
(inaudible speaking)

18:29.876 --> 18:31.275
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.377
- I think I got something.
- Hmm, do tell.

18:33.379 --> 18:36.547
- Well, I was able to track down
one of bertie garrick's guests.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.283
Apparently, this isn't the first
theft that's happened at a party

18:39.319 --> 18:41.618
In one of their social circles.
- It's interesting.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.022
- (trudy): Nothing as valuable
as a lafitte. A wallet here
or a broach there.

18:45.058 --> 18:48.092
A man's gold cufflink
was taken from a party at
his flat a couple weeks ago.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.495
- Any idea who took it?
- No.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.296
But those daybreak girls
were there.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.036
- Smith know anything
about the lafitte?

18:59.038 --> 19:02.173
- He was surprised,
intrigued and so happy

19:02.175 --> 19:04.708
For the information that
he promised to give me a call

19:04.744 --> 19:07.478
As soon as he heard
anything at all.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.313
(frankie chuckling)
- nice work.

19:13.586 --> 19:17.388
- So then he offered to teach me
how to build a radio myself,

19:17.523 --> 19:19.456
And now he comes over
twice a week,

19:19.492 --> 19:22.660
And I bake him cookies.
- Is he your boyfriend?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.529
- No. He's my neighbour.
He's 72.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.065
- Oh, this is
misfortunate.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.734
- But just imagine
all of the things that he's

19:30.770 --> 19:32.269
Seen in his life.
For example, he was

19:32.305 --> 19:35.239
In michigan for herring's
first biplane flight.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.041
- I cannot bear old people
myself. Kat, would you

19:37.176 --> 19:39.343
Pass me that<i> vogue?</i>

19:39.379 --> 19:40.811
- Hello, ladies!

19:40.880 --> 19:44.248
What's on the go today?
- Tara, you found us.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.417
- Mind if I get some snaps?

19:46.486 --> 19:48.819
- Do give it a rest, tara.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.889
- Wherever did you get
that suit? Woolworths?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.558
- Have you anything
better to do today

19:54.594 --> 19:57.695
Than follow us around
like a little lost duckling?

19:57.830 --> 19:59.563
- All right then.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.498
Maybe next time.
- Mhm.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.569
- Well, hang on. You can't speak
to her like that.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.006
She's just doing
her job,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.108
Which I suppose
you don't understand

20:11.177 --> 20:12.977
Because you've never done
a lick of work in your life.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.579
But let's be honest.
You need her

20:15.648 --> 20:18.182
Just as much
as she needs you.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.450
- I beg your pardon?
- Tara tweet

20:20.486 --> 20:22.586

31:47.873 --> 31:51.274
- I borrowed your boyfriend.
- Oh!

31:52.278 --> 31:54.611
- (trudy):
Meet alessandro contento

31:54.613 --> 31:56.947
And aline aymard.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.350
- I love it.
So, what's the plan?

32:00.352 --> 32:03.486
- I am, as you know,
a wealthy race car driver

32:03.555 --> 32:05.555
With a taste
for fine wine.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.890
Aline here is
my personal sommelier.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.695
- (with french accent):
Wine is in my blood,

32:11.697 --> 32:14.164
Like it was in my mother's
and her mother's before that.

32:14.233 --> 32:16.867
- Hm!
- Ooh!

32:16.869 --> 32:18.302
(flo and frankie laughing)

32:18.437 --> 32:20.770
- So, mickey pete
told us that

32:20.806 --> 32:23.840
A mr. Izakow will be at
the auction. Now, mr. Izakow has

32:23.842 --> 32:26.109
Some deep pockets.
He's a diplomat.

32:26.244 --> 32:28.245
If he gets his hands on
the wine, we can't touch him.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.846
- So how do we stop him?
- Ah, see,

32:29.848 --> 32:31.982
That's where we come in.
- Mickey pete

32:32.117 --> 32:34.451
Says izakow has
no real taste for wine,

32:34.520 --> 32:35.786
Buys according to prestige.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.455
- Hey, he doesn't know
shiraz from chardonnay.

32:38.524 --> 32:41.524
He will buy whatever he is told
is most expensive.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.525
- Right. Ok, ok.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.995
So, the flashy race car driver
and his personal

32:44.997 --> 32:47.397
Sommelier convince izakow
that the real steal

32:47.532 --> 32:49.466
Of the auction is anything other
than the lafitte.

32:49.468 --> 32:53.336
- Lafitte is for peasants!
I wouldn't give to my dog!

32:53.339 --> 32:54.804
(laughing)

32:54.873 --> 32:57.206
- You could be
a little more subtle, right?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.077
Do you think leo's gonna
let us disrupt his auction?

33:01.146 --> 33:03.680
- We won't disrupt anything.
Leo can still have his auction,

33:03.749 --> 33:06.283
As long as we make sure the
lafitte doesn't get to
the wrong hands.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.752
- How do we get it out of
whoever's hands it ends up in?

33:08.754 --> 33:10.953
- Well, we have a conversation
with that person,

33:10.990 --> 33:13.423
Let them know about
the possession of stolen goods,

33:13.558 --> 33:16.159
And I'm sure he will
change his mind.
- Ok.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.662
Smart thinking all around.
- It was all trudy's idea.

33:20.966 --> 33:23.300
- Well, see? Insurance doesn't
have to be so boring.

33:23.435 --> 33:25.368

33:25.437 --> 33:28.571
(indistinct conversations)

That's all we gotta do?

33:28.607 --> 33:30.107
- Jelly roll.
- Go ahead.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.109
Hohoho! You two.

33:33.145 --> 33:35.779
What do you want?
- We're mr. Contento's security.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.713
- Oh! We got
all kinds of security

33:37.750 --> 33:39.716
Around here.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.919
But I guess you broads could use
the dough, so come on in.

33:42.955 --> 33:45.455
- Race car drivers pay
real well.

33:45.457 --> 33:46.990
- Now, listen:
You cause any trouble--

33:47.125 --> 33:49.192
- We saw the gun.
- Yeah, well,
they're not just for seeing.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.661

eh, drake?

34:00.072 --> 34:01.271

34:01.340 --> 34:04.007
- All these snobs thinking
this grape juice is worth money.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.275
I mean, give me a shot
of bourbon any time.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.744
- Or gin.
- Yeah, or gin.

34:08.781 --> 34:11.748
All right.
Remember, behave yourselves.

34:11.883 --> 34:15.151

- I've heard of you.
You are known to be
a man of discerning taste.

34:30.569 --> 34:34.037
- Why, thank you.
This wine is but a hobby.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.573
- And you are interested
in the d'yquem, I imagine?

34:36.708 --> 34:37.841
- Of course.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.177
- Oh, it is the steal
of the evening.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.777
- You should know,
mr. Izakow,

34:41.814 --> 34:45.448
I'm not just a worthy competitor
on the racetrack, huh?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.651
- Keeping out of trouble,
miss drake?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.920
- Only for you, leo.
- Hm.

34:50.055 --> 34:51.455
- Do these sellers show up
to these things?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.190
- Ah, most of the vendors prefer
to remain discreet.

34:54.226 --> 34:57.527
- Hm... I wonder why that is.
- Do you, miss drake?

34:57.529 --> 34:59.395
Ah, let me see.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.932
I think it's because probably
some of the wine they buy

39:51.790 --> 39:54.491
- I took it.
- Well, that's obvious.

when my plan went to pot.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.970

his own way.

- So you were going to use
the money from the auction
to get started?

40:12.144 --> 40:15.445

hurt; his insurance
would have paid.

further in debt.

40:17.849 --> 40:20.650

weren't a couple?

But I love her.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.725

But now we've lost

40:29.727 --> 40:31.794
Thousands of daddy's money.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.596

to get hurt.

40:33.665 --> 40:35.265

- Well, they have
loads of money, don't they?

40:37.202 --> 40:40.469

have to pay the claim.

40:40.505 --> 40:41.871
Take it.

40:44.176 --> 40:47.477

so understanding.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.158

41:05.897 --> 41:07.830

41:07.899 --> 41:10.299
At least some version of me.

I walked out on you last night.

42:58.643 --> 43:00.610
- It's all right.

43:00.612 --> 43:02.878

to the sun.
