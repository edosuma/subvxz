WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:06.129
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.483
-(sighs)
-(knocking continues)

01:34.662 --> 01:37.197
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.400
-I brought your mail.
-Thanks.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.734
Another rejection.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.604
How do you know?
You haven't even opened it yet.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.906
Donald, if they like it,
they call.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.508
(growls)

01:47.508 --> 01:48.709
Diablo, come on.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.142
(snaps fingers)

01:52.479 --> 01:55.749
Ten years I've been
at this, Donald. Ten years!

01:55.749 --> 01:58.485
And what do I have
to show for it?

01:58.485 --> 02:01.283
A file full
of rejections and a...

02:03.357 --> 02:07.027
...crummy room in this
flea-bitten hole-in-the-wall.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.962
I haven't seen any fleas here.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.331
You got any fleas, honey? Huh?

02:11.331 --> 02:14.664
God, I've give anything
to sell a script-- anything.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.538
Oh, really?

02:17.538 --> 02:19.306
(sighs)

02:19.306 --> 02:21.141
(chuckles):
You hear that?

02:21.141 --> 02:22.376
(Diablo growls)

02:22.376 --> 02:24.144
Um... (clears throat)

02:24.144 --> 02:27.381
Listen, in that case, uh,
w-why don't I just, uh,

02:27.381 --> 02:30.451
take this home a-and give it
a quick read-through?

02:30.451 --> 02:31.552
What do you say?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.120
No, l... I
could offer you

02:33.120 --> 02:35.122
some suggestions, maybe.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.591
l majored in English.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.059
It wouldn't do any good, Donald.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.495
It's not the script,
it's who you know.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.733
You mean it's not the movie,
it's... it's the deal, huh?

02:45.733 --> 02:47.968
Yeah, you got it,
and I know nobody.

02:47.968 --> 02:48.696
You know me.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.741
Right.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.042
I'm serious, kid.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.177
I got a number of important
contacts in this town.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.679
If you want,
I'll take it home

02:58.679 --> 03:00.180
and I'll give it
a quick read-through,

03:00.180 --> 03:01.682
and l-l'll tell you
what I think.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.486
Let's just see what goes
with this next mailing, okay?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.988
Okay by me.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.823
Come on, let's go home, Diablo.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.625
-You think it over, will you?
-Yeah, I will.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.294
Okay, take it easy.
Come on, Diablo.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.863
Bye, kid.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.699
I hate it when it gets this hot.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.690
I kind of like it.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.964
(door creaks)

03:27.274 --> 03:29.003
(sighs)

03:42.022 --> 03:43.891
(chuckling quietly)

03:43.891 --> 03:45.222
(mutters):
Come on.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.051
(chuckles)

03:51.265 --> 03:53.961
(siren wailing in distance)

03:55.602 --> 03:57.437
Tom?

03:57.437 --> 04:00.174
It's me, Donald.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.142
Tom, I... I took your scripts

04:02.142 --> 04:04.812
to some friends
of mine to read.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.146
Great.

04:06.146 --> 04:08.048
No, no, Tom...

04:08.048 --> 04:10.380
Look at this-- I mean it.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.862
Donald, this is a contract!

04:21.862 --> 04:23.030
(Donald laughs)

04:23.030 --> 04:24.698
From Pacific Pictures!

04:24.698 --> 04:26.700
(laughing):
I know.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.702
I took it to Global, see?

04:28.702 --> 04:31.772
But Global wanted to do it
as a movie-of-the-week.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.841
I hope you don't mind.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.843
Mind? This is fantastic!

04:35.843 --> 04:38.145
How in the hell
did you do this?

04:38.145 --> 04:40.514
Just like you said,
it-it's all who you know.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.150
I don't believe this!

04:43.150 --> 04:45.118
See if you can believe this.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.994
$20,000?!

04:53.994 --> 04:55.896
Donald, you're a genius!

04:55.896 --> 04:57.764
(laughing)

04:57.764 --> 04:59.299
I'll be damned!

04:59.299 --> 05:01.301
You said it.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.302
(cackling)

05:02.302 --> 05:03.303
Come here.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.471
(Donald laughs)

05:04.471 --> 05:07.875
Whoo!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.866
(laughing)

05:15.415 --> 05:17.351
Beautiful. Beautiful.
I love it.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.518
It's so high-concept.

05:18.518 --> 05:19.987
Okay, babe,

05:19.987 --> 05:22.589
have your girl call my girl,
and we'll do lunch.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.924
Ciao, bella.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.826
WOMAN:
Excuse me, sir.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.827
I'm Tom Dash.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.161
Do you want me
to call security?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.162
Uh, it's okay, sweetheart.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.931
Uh, be a good girl
and go get us

05:30.931 --> 05:32.466
a couple of cups
of coffee, will you?

05:32.466 --> 05:34.400
No. Thanks.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.070
Hey, Tom, what'd you think

05:37.070 --> 05:38.872
of that sneak preview?
Beautiful, wasn't it?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.374
It was garbage.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.075
You destroyed my film!

05:42.075 --> 05:44.144
Take it easy.
Want a drink?

05:44.144 --> 05:46.980
I want to know how you could
take a sensitive story

05:46.980 --> 05:49.349
about a mother
and her lost child

05:49.349 --> 05:52.252
and turn it
into a heavy metal rock video.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.088
We just had to slide
a few numbers in here and there,

05:55.088 --> 05:56.690
just to keep the story moving.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.926
The dialogue had the action

05:58.926 --> 06:01.094
if you'd just
let the actors say it.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.096
Tommy, today's audiences--

06:03.096 --> 06:04.932
they're not into dialogue.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.199
Neither are you.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.036
Tommy, Tommy, baby, grow up.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.537
This is the real world.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.772
When the grosses come in,

06:11.772 --> 06:14.675
and your film is at the top
of the box office receipts,

06:14.675 --> 06:16.910
you'll have
a whole different attitude.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.212
Tommy, you're gonna happen.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.715
Trust me.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.417
I want you to call my girl

06:23.417 --> 06:25.619
and we'll do lunch
at Sambuca's, all right?

06:25.619 --> 06:28.455
Now, listen, I'll bet you got
a project somewhere, huh?

06:28.455 --> 06:30.424
One that's in the back
of your mind.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.092
Something you've been dying
to do.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.561
Am I right?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.330
What do you say?

06:36.330 --> 06:38.265
Sure, Vince.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.334
Tommy, you're beautiful.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.102
Don't change.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.127
I love you.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.235
(sighs)

06:52.546 --> 06:54.537
Schmuck.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.851
(knocking)

06:57.851 --> 06:59.011
Come in.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.756
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.992
How'd it go, kid?

07:04.992 --> 07:06.293
(sighs)

07:06.293 --> 07:07.661
Don't even ask.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.731
Hmm. That bad, huh?

07:10.731 --> 07:12.566
J‘ Sorry. J‘

07:12.566 --> 07:16.837
I give 'em art,
and they give me back crap.

07:16.837 --> 07:17.895
Ooh!

07:19.306 --> 07:22.876
The money was in the limousine,
not on the screen, eh?

07:22.876 --> 07:25.679
What do those guys know
about making movies, anyway?

07:25.679 --> 07:27.247
Just a bunch of accountants

07:27.247 --> 07:30.917
who wouldn't know a jump cut if
it bit 'em in the bottom line.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.120
Hey, just once,

07:33.120 --> 07:35.288
I'd like to have the power,
just once.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.125
I'm gonna get you that power.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.593
Come on, Donald.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.395
You got me that deal somehow.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.963
What are you gonna do, make me

07:42.963 --> 07:45.065
-a movie mogul?
-Yup.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.700
Don't be ridiculous.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.301
Who do you think you are?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.360
I'm the Devil.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.171
Yeah?

07:54.374 --> 07:56.643
Where-Where's your horns
and tail?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.745
(laughing):
No, no...

07:58.745 --> 08:00.313
Tom, please.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.916
That-That...
That's in cartoons.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.751
Tha-That...

08:04.751 --> 08:06.887
I'm the real stuff.

08:06.887 --> 08:11.291
And the Devil can do anything
he wants...

08:11.291 --> 08:12.359
for a price.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.394
What, ten percent?

08:14.394 --> 08:16.630
More.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.324
Twenty?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.167
You talking about my soul?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.736
(laughs)

08:22.736 --> 08:24.971
(laughing):
You're crazy, Donald.

08:24.971 --> 08:28.642
You're flipped out.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.578
I like bad TV.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.147
You think it over, kid.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.651
I mean, like I said before:
it's not the movie,

08:37.651 --> 08:39.710
it's the deal, right?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.279
And that's the deal.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.864
Okay, Donald,
so you say you're the...

08:50.864 --> 08:52.855
(Donald laughing)

08:54.868 --> 08:57.871
I thought you said
you didn't have a tail.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.240
I lied. (laughs)

09:00.240 --> 09:02.843
Uh, I don't believe this.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.378
You want... you want
to feel my horns?

09:05.378 --> 09:07.214
No. Thanks.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.205
Uh...

09:10.217 --> 09:12.519
If you lied to me about these,

09:12.519 --> 09:14.621
how can I trust you to help me?

09:14.621 --> 09:15.956
Oh, come on, kid.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.758
Who can you trust
in this town?

09:18.758 --> 09:21.194
That never stopped anybody
from doing business.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.831
Besides, you want
to run the whole show or what?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.666
You mean, sign with you?

09:26.666 --> 09:30.971
Sure. I know I got a contract
here somewhere.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.440
Here, let's see...

09:33.440 --> 09:35.275
Actors,

09:35.275 --> 09:37.511
producers, accountants.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.741
There-- writers.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.884
There we go.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.620
Couldn't we do it on spec?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.355
Spec?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.690
I never work on spec.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.792
But we're talking
about giving up my soul.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.161
Come on, kid.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.630
Half this town operates
without one just fine,

09:56.630 --> 09:59.064
and the other half is just
waiting to make the deal.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.996
Besides, it's the chance
of a lifetime.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.410
(Donald chuckles)

10:10.410 --> 10:12.537
There you go.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.139
Ah.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.853
(Donald laughs)

10:34.100 --> 10:35.402
You're gonna love this one,
babe.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.270
It's got all the elements
of every hit picture

10:37.270 --> 10:39.873
of the last 20 years
crammed together into one plot.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.708
-Can't miss.
-Rea|ly, Vincent?

10:41.708 --> 10:43.476
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Dash is here.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.467
Oh, send him right in.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.484
Hi, Tom. Nice of you to come
on such short notice.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.786
What's this all about?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.354
You better ask him.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.223
Kingsley Diamond,

10:56.223 --> 10:57.657
meet Tom Dash,
one of Hollywood's

10:57.657 --> 10:59.759
hottest young screenwriters.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.595
Pleasure.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.163
Kingsley here
is Chief Executive Officer

11:03.163 --> 11:05.098
of Tropical Fruit,
our parent company.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.099
Please, please.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.668
WOMAN (over intercom):
There's a call for you on four.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.503
I told you to hold all calls.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.771
WOMAN:
It's Jerry.

11:11.771 --> 11:15.175
(sighs): Oh, thatjerk!
Uh, excuse me.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.543
Jerry, sweetheart.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.778
Haven't I met you
someplace before?

11:18.778 --> 11:20.814
Maybe shopping.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.382
You go to Rodeo Drive?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.985
No, I can't afford it.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.152
Don't worry.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.356
You will... very soon.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.758
VINCENT:
No, no, no, let me tell

11:31.758 --> 11:34.327
you something-- if he's not on
that set at 8:00 in the morning,

11:34.327 --> 11:35.595
I'll personally see to it

11:35.595 --> 11:38.231
that he never works
in this town again.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.467
Agents!
Why did God create them?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.636
Same reason he made flies.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.438
(snickers)

11:45.438 --> 11:47.874
That's good, King.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.376
Now, what's happening here?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.944
I got movies to make.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.145
Not anymore, Vince.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.680
We gotta let you go.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.484
What-What... What are you
talking about here, King?

11:57.484 --> 12:00.086
Come on, you're kidding me,
aren't you?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.077
(chuckles)

12:04.324 --> 12:06.359
No, no, I'm serious.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.461
You're through, you're gone,
you're history.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.630
Tom here's what's happening now.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.798
Him?

12:11.798 --> 12:14.534
He's just a slob
with a word processor.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.003
What the hell does he know
about making movies?

12:17.003 --> 12:18.638
Kingsley,
what are you talking about?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.373
You can't do this to me,
Kingsley.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.808
I got the house in Malibu.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.209
Kimberly's suing me
for palimony.

12:23.209 --> 12:25.268
King, baby, have a heart here.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.349
Vincent, please, please.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.442
Pull yourself together.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.355
It's nothing personal.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.390
It's just business.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.292
But we had a deal.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.727
I trusted you.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.463
Oh, all right,
all right, Vincent.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.332
I can always use guys like you.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.697
You see?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.803
I'm much too soft.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.072
You know what I'll do
for you, Vincent?

12:52.072 --> 12:53.840
I'll ship Dietz over to Global,

12:53.840 --> 12:55.508
and I'll shuttle the guy

12:55.508 --> 12:56.876
from Global off somewhere.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.945
Maybe to... to Worldstar.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.114
And I'll kick Brewster upstairs
at Liberty.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.216
And I'll move you in
right there.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.352
Thanks, King. Thank you.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.553
(chuckles)

13:06.553 --> 13:09.322
All right, Vincent--
please, go.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.191
We have pictures to make here.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.192
(chuckles)

13:12.192 --> 13:14.227
You're gonna love King.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.895
He's a great boss.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.097
Vincent.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.088
Right.

13:21.768 --> 13:22.632
Vincent?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.194
The hat.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.365
(whispers):
Bye.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.246
(Kingsley chuckles)

13:33.246 --> 13:34.614
Forget it.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.105
(chuckles, sighs)

13:38.785 --> 13:41.921
(Kingsley hums)

13:41.921 --> 13:43.912
(chuckles)

13:44.958 --> 13:47.324
Ah. Mm.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.562
(sniffles)
Come on.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.098
I want you to sit right here
in this chair, kid.

13:52.098 --> 13:55.135
Come on. It's yours.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.126
(clears throat)

14:01.274 --> 14:02.442
Huh?

14:02.442 --> 14:03.676
(Tom sighs)

14:03.676 --> 14:04.978
Huh?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.813
Whew!

14:06.813 --> 14:08.804
(Kingsley laughs)

14:11.050 --> 14:13.382
Why are you giving me this job?

14:16.122 --> 14:19.759
Because you're a genius, kid,
and this town needs you.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.989
You know a guy named Donald?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.832
Bobby...

14:25.832 --> 14:27.801
You accepted? Fantastic!

14:27.801 --> 14:29.702
You know, Bob, I had you in mind

14:29.702 --> 14:31.304
from the moment
I started writing.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.706
And listen--
the best news of all--

14:33.706 --> 14:35.708
Mike Rudnick is set to direct.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.976
That's right.

14:36.976 --> 14:39.145
And I got this great girl
to play opposite you--

14:39.145 --> 14:40.146
Cassie Smith.

14:40.146 --> 14:42.148
She's an unknown,
but she's fabulous.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.017
Just-Just wait
till you meet her, Bobby.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.218
You'll love her.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.387
Okay, Bobby,
I'll talk to you soon.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.649
Bye-bye.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.924
All right!

14:56.429 --> 14:58.631
But Cassie's perfect
for this part.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.334
MAN (over phone):
Maybe, but Debbie's my client,

15:01.334 --> 15:03.303
and so is your leading man.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.838
Jer, babe, be fair.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.272
MAN:
Fair?

15:06.272 --> 15:08.007
Oh, that's the package, darling.

15:08.007 --> 15:11.177
I mean, you want my star,
you got to take his girlfriend.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.168
(click, dial tone)

15:15.415 --> 15:17.406
(sighs)

15:24.691 --> 15:27.393
Debbie's doing the part?
Debbie?!

15:27.393 --> 15:28.862
What is this?

15:28.862 --> 15:30.063
You promised!

15:30.063 --> 15:31.331
I know I did, babe.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.900
It was either that,
or lose the picture.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.134
Tom, something's happened
to you.

15:35.134 --> 15:38.238
You're not the same person
I used to know.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.239
Sure, I am.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.308
I'm just more successful,
that's all.

15:42.308 --> 15:46.312
But you wrote that part for me,
remember?

15:46.312 --> 15:49.082
Babe, I'll get you
another part.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.584
Maybe you will,
and maybe you won't,

15:51.584 --> 15:53.019
but I'll tell you this:

15:53.019 --> 15:54.721
You'll never create
another thing.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.322
You're dead inside, Tom.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.882
I can see it behind your eyes.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.700
(sighs)

16:07.700 --> 16:09.691
WOMAN (over intercom):
Michael Rudnick is here.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.063
(sighs)

16:19.245 --> 16:20.246
Mr. Rudnick.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.581
-Hey, hey.
-How are you?

16:21.581 --> 16:22.682
-|'m fine.
-Come on in.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.883
Make yourself at home.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.185
Very nice. Thank you.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.821
Mr. Rudnick, I can't tell you
what an honor it is

16:28.821 --> 16:30.690
to have you direct my film.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.158
The honor's all mine, kid.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.761
Have we met?

16:34.761 --> 16:37.764
Maybe at Cannes,
one of those festivals.

16:37.764 --> 16:38.865
I don't know.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.100
By the way, I love the script.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.569
Well, thank you.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.937
Thank you very much.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.606
I, uh... I wrote it myself.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.074
You did? That's terrific.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.577
Then we don't have to deal
with the writer at all, right?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.845
I mean, 'cause that love stuff--
it's a lot of mush.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.280
Nobody wants
to see that mush anymore.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.748
You know what I'm saying?
And that war?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.417
What is... What is...
What is he, a hero?

16:57.417 --> 17:00.286
He's no hero.
He's a maniac! He's a maniac!

17:00.286 --> 17:02.322
He wants to kill,
he wants to chop.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.591
He's got a fetish about nurses.
Don't you understand?

17:04.591 --> 17:05.858
He wants to kill.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.860
And it's got to be something
razor sharp.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.430
And I happen to know a guy
personally in Pittsburgh.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.966
He can make blood
like you could taste it!

17:12.966 --> 17:14.968
You're not doing that
to my film.

17:14.968 --> 17:15.969
I won't let you.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.036
What are you talking about?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.305
I ran the idea past King.
He loves the idea.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.608
King said I was a genius.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.710
That was last week, kid.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.479
Hey, you want to fly with this,
or shall I go over to Pacific?

17:26.479 --> 17:27.714
But I'll tell you one thing--

17:27.714 --> 17:29.582
if I take a walk,
King won't like it.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.618
No, no. It's...

17:31.618 --> 17:34.721
It's just such a big change,
that's all.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.289
Well, I'll tell you
something, kid.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.191
Scripts aren't written,
they're rewritten.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.893
Now, come on, get me a pad.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.918
Let's go to work here.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.966
Diablo, baby...

17:46.966 --> 17:47.955
(Diablo barks)

17:49.035 --> 17:50.603
I gotta talk to you.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.640
What's the matter, kid, huh?

17:53.640 --> 17:56.142
I want out.

17:56.142 --> 17:59.712
Oh... sorry.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.080
A deal's a deal.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.082
Please?
I can't take this anymore.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.485
Sorry, kid,
I never give up a soul

18:05.485 --> 18:08.254
once I've got a signed contract.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.723
All I wanted was
to do something good!

18:10.723 --> 18:11.724
(laughs)

18:11.724 --> 18:13.693
Welcome to Hollywood,
kid, right?

18:13.693 --> 18:16.195
Mm. You know what
your problem is?

18:16.195 --> 18:17.856
You're too soft.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.200
I know. I'm a softie myself.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.568
(sighs)

18:22.568 --> 18:25.638
All right, I'll tell you
what I'll do, kid.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.106
Go. Go on.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.675
Get me somebody to replace you.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.476
Wh-Wh-What do you call 'em,
a stand-in?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.245
-Huh?
-Yeah.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.446
Right? Just get me somebody.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.847
I'll put him
under your contract,

18:34.847 --> 18:37.984
and then you can go home to Ohio
and be an English teacher again.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.252
Sound good?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.553
Donald, that sounds great.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.155
All right, but here's the deal.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.322
I'm a busy man.

18:43.322 --> 18:44.857
You only get one chance.

18:44.857 --> 18:45.892
One chance?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.226
That's right,

18:47.226 --> 18:49.362
so you better pick someone
as desperate as you were.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.065
I don't know anyone
that desperate.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.167
In this town? Are you kidding?

18:54.167 --> 18:56.636
-(Donald cackles)
-Wait...

18:56.636 --> 18:57.837
wait, there is someone.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.405
I'll be right back.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.140
Ooh, take your time, kid.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.574
You can't afford
to make a mistake.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.251
(Diablo whining)

19:12.251 --> 19:13.980
Ah...

19:15.722 --> 19:17.423
Donald?

19:17.423 --> 19:19.092
He must be around here
somewhere.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.326
Come on in.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.061
I don't understand.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.896
What kind
of an audition is this?

19:23.896 --> 19:25.198
It's the latest thing.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.500
You-You audition for the part
in the actual location.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.968
All the directors are doing it.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.803
So let me get this straight.

19:30.803 --> 19:34.073
I'm playing a woman who wants
to sell her soul to the Devil?

19:34.073 --> 19:35.641
Right. And just
start improvising

19:35.641 --> 19:37.643
as soon
as he comes back in here.

19:37.643 --> 19:40.146
Improvise? Where's the script?

19:40.146 --> 19:41.614
I don't know what to say.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.483
Just say whatever pops
into your head.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.951
Use something
from your personal life.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.319
Use me. Just keep talking.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.154
DONALD:
Diablo, come on, huh?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.655
Oh, hi.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.225
I was just down
by the, uh, incinerator.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.894
I hope I haven't kept you
waiting too long.

19:54.894 --> 19:57.192
-Now?
-Now.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.401
I want to sell my soul
to the Devil.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.604
Yeah? (laughs)

20:04.604 --> 20:06.639
Well, in that case,

20:06.639 --> 20:09.041
you've certainly come
to the right place.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.244
But tell me,
what do you want for it?

20:11.244 --> 20:13.513
I want revenge.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.548
Revenge?

20:15.548 --> 20:19.085
On the man who told me
he loved me,

20:19.085 --> 20:22.851
and then dumped me
like yesterday's garbage.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.058
(chuckles)

20:26.058 --> 20:27.360
Revenge, eh?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.028
That good, old-fashioned one.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.196
I like that.

20:30.196 --> 20:31.356
You got a deal.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.634
Wait a minute...

20:34.634 --> 20:36.101
(snaps fingers)

20:43.576 --> 20:44.811
(chuckles)

20:44.811 --> 20:46.546
I know.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.916
Um, so you're an actress, right?

20:49.916 --> 20:52.485
Well... aspiring.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.520
Uh-huh.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.356
Well, I think I have a part

20:57.356 --> 21:00.519
that you just might
be perfect for.

21:19.712 --> 21:23.516
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.052
Waiting for us to enter.
