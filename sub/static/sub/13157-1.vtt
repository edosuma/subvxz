<i>("Living in the USA "
by the Steve Miller Band)</i>

01:03.647 --> 01:05.899
Brass!

01:11.280 --> 01:12.656
<i>Livin' in the USA</i>

01:12.823 --> 01:16.493
<i>(male radio presenter) This is WBXT,
the voice of Fort Baxter.</i>

01:16.660 --> 01:20.664
<i>All personnel are invited to join
Sergeant Bilko in the motor pool...</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:23.667
<i>... for a demonstration
of proper spark-plug maintenance...</i>

01:23.834 --> 01:27.754
<i>... today at 0420, 0530 and 1455.</i>

01:29.673 --> 01:33.844
<i>Those times again. 0420, 0530 and 1455.</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:37.097
- Did you win?
- Nope.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.354
Private Wally Holbrook
reporting for duty.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.273
- First assignment?
- Yes.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.276
- Relax. Know where you're assigned?
- Motor pool.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.695
- OK. Motor pool?
- Yes, I...

01:51.862 --> 01:56.033
- You're going straight to the colonel.
- Colonel? What'd I do?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.952
- How old are you, son?
- Nineteen, sir.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.371
Nineteen... So young.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.374
I'm a first-rate mechanic.
My two uncles owned a garage.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.792
- Got any money?
- Yes, sir.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.211
- Give it to me.
- But...

02:07.377 --> 02:10.130
It's all right.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.638
- My word, there must be $500 in here.
- 700. See, I worked at my uncle's...

02:17.804 --> 02:21.558
You're going to take $700
in cash into Bilko's barracks?

02:21.725 --> 02:25.562
- Yes, sir. Who, sir?
- Give me your hat, please.

02:25.729 --> 02:30.067
Sergeant Bilko.
Master Sergeant Ernest G Bilko.

02:30.943 --> 02:34.154
- Well, good luck. And Godspeed.
- Thank you, sir.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.991
Remember, if you need anything
at all, need any help...

02:38.158 --> 02:42.246
...the old colonel's door is always open.
- Thank you, sir.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.666
<i>- Sir?
- (whistles)</i>

02:59.930 --> 03:03.684
- I'm lookin' for Sergeant Bilko.
- You're too late, junior, no more bets.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.521
- No, no, no. I'm reporting in.
- Come on, Duane! Pull!

03:07.688 --> 03:10.440
Dig deep, baby!

03:13.694 --> 03:19.449
Come on! Come on!

03:42.306 --> 03:45.309
He's got the wrong shoes!
Doberman's wearing the wrong shoes.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.896
He's got no traction. And this horse!

03:49.062 --> 03:53.400
This horse was not this lively this
morning. I want it drug tested now!

03:53.567 --> 03:57.821
Someone, quick.
Get a urine bottle and a mop.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.413
Hey! What's goin' on?

04:07.748 --> 04:11.084
It's Private Doberman. He's the one
who looks sort of human.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.338
Last night in the gym, Doberman said
"I feel as strong as a horse."

04:14.505 --> 04:17.841
Some guy from company P overheard him
and said "Yeah? For how much?"

04:18.007 --> 04:21.928
It's the golden rule. You don't say nothing
unless you're prepared to back it up.

04:22.095 --> 04:27.601
No, no, not across the line.
Don't go across. Back. Just, back. Back.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.287
- Are you OK, Duane?
- Sarge, I can't do this any more!

04:47.454 --> 04:50.374
You did your best, Duane.
What's money, anyway?

04:50.541 --> 04:54.378
So, Bilko, I finally won one. Pay up.

04:54.711 --> 04:57.631
<i>(Bilko sighs)</i>

04:57.881 --> 05:00.300
- Hurry up.
- Oh, so now we're on a schedule?

05:00.467 --> 05:04.137
- Shall we go once more?
- Sarge! Please, no more. No more, Sarge.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.640
Don't worry. I won't put you
through that again.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.644
- He's finished. He's a loser.
- No one calls one of Bilko's men a loser.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.982
I oughta... Hold me back! Aah.
No, no! Let me go! I'll kill him.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.318
- You wanna double the bet?
- Double the bet? Ha! You're serious.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.488
- Sarge, no.
- What's the matter, Ernie? Scared?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.741
Sarge, please. That's all
the platoon's money-every cent.

05:24.867 --> 05:29.329
This is beyond money now. This is
a matter of honour. OK, the bet is 1,000.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.415
Sucker.

05:31.582 --> 05:34.334
<i>(Bilko's men) Yeah!</i>

05:34.501 --> 05:36.795
Hey, you can't do that, man.

05:36.962 --> 05:39.173
- Ready, Duane?
- Sure, Sarge.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.177
See? He was just rollin' up the bet.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.430
He's like a god.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.028
Duane! Duane! Duane!

06:01.195 --> 06:05.282
Duane! Duane! Duane!
Duane! Duane! Duane!

06:28.055 --> 06:30.641
Yeah! Yeah!

06:35.729 --> 06:39.149
Walk him around and wipe him down.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.319
Not the horse! Doberman.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.572
Listen, that M2 Bradley vehicle
is property of the US Army.

06:45.739 --> 06:51.578
I want it back on the post by tonight.
We have rules! Rules and regulations.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.582
I have your rental agreement right here.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.169
And if you blow anything up,
it's coming out of your deposit.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.172
Teenagers! So irresponsible.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.259
- Sarge, you said I could count the take.
- She got to count it last time.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.512
Will you stop fighting?
It's like I'm running a daycare centre.

07:08.679 --> 07:12.266
Actually, that's not a bad idea.
We could keep 'em in the storeroom.

07:12.432 --> 07:16.520
- Luis, how many kids on the post?
- Personal dependants under five?

07:16.687 --> 07:19.606
- 293.
- Get me the total of their allowances.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.943
- Hey, in the storeroom? Kids?
- Zimmy, they won't die.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.113
In fact, that'll be our motto:
"They won't die."

07:26.280 --> 07:30.200
I'll count the money. Rocky, make sure
the horse gets back to Knott's Berry Farm.

07:30.367 --> 07:34.121
Private First Class Holbrook, Walter T,
reporting in for duty, Sergeant!

07:34.288 --> 07:36.290
Sarge, Holbrook is a tech-school terror.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.042
First in his class,
motor-vehicle maintenance.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.378
A real live wrench-turner
in the motor pool?

07:41.545 --> 07:46.049
It's so crazy, it just might work.
I'll introduce you to the boys and girls.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.552
<i>- (Bilko sniffs)
- What's the matter, Sarge?</i>

07:48.719 --> 07:52.306
Don't you smell it? It's money.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.645
This is Sgt Henshaw and Sgt Barbella.
You'll see them about dances, raffles.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.481
You'll get your tickets
through them. They run the shop.

08:01.648 --> 08:05.569
So if you need stationery, magazines...
But not magazine subscriptions.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.321
See Morales about that. Towels...

08:07.487 --> 08:11.575
- Towels? Doesn't the army issue towels?
- Army? Get him a set of towels.

08:11.742 --> 08:15.329
The fluffy ones.
The introductory price. Come on.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.166
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.753
This is Dino Paparelli.
You're gonna laugh, you're gonna cry.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.255
You're gonna love
this scrappy little Italian.

08:25.422 --> 08:28.342
- Hiya.
- Sam Fender. His motto in life is simple:

08:28.509 --> 08:30.928
..."An indictment is not a conviction."
- Damn straight.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.847
That's manly talk. Mickey Zimmerman.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.433
Tragically, Zimmerman was born
without a personality.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.937
- Hello.
- Luis Clemente.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.688
This guy is smart, very smart.
He has an IQ.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.692
- Hello.
- See what I mean?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.612
Tony Morales. The only thing
you need to know about him...

08:48.779 --> 08:51.698
...is he doesn't take showers
because it fogs up the mirror.

08:51.865 --> 08:56.703
Finally, the man of the hour, the master
of disaster, the king of the universe -

08:56.912 --> 09:01.458
...look out, girls, he hates to dine alone -
Private Duane Doberman!

09:01.667 --> 09:02.709
Aw, Sarge.

09:02.876 --> 09:08.632
Doberman doesn't take showers either,
but for a much more frightening reason.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.468
My orders, Sergeant.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.805
Everything seems to be in order.
Henshaw will take your bags.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.890
Don't worry, he's bonded. Got a licence?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.309
- A driver's licence?
- We can make one up.

09:19.476 --> 09:23.063
- Henshaw, get the camera!
- No, no. I have a licence. It's right here.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.566
My wallet.

09:25.691 --> 09:29.486
Oh, here it is. Empty.
It's in your hat, isn't it?

09:29.695 --> 09:35.659
Good boy. Oh. Oh, there must be six...
no, seven hundred dollars in here. Good.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.329
Well, you can start with this.
The colonel's car.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.040
- OK, what's wrong with it?
- It's the odometer.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.752
It says 12,000 miles,
and it should say 11,000 miles.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.631
Tony drove it to Lake Tahoe
to go to his grandmother's funeral.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.176
- I'm sorry.
- When I say that...

09:52.342 --> 09:57.973
...I mean "visit his niece". And
when I say "niece", I mean lady friend?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.727
Look. I'm winking. Look at my eye.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.439
<i>- You want me to turn that back?
- (gasps) Yes.</i>

10:05.606 --> 10:09.109
- I can't do that, Sergeant.
- "Can't"! He said "can't"!

10:09.276 --> 10:11.445
Sarge, are you all right?

10:11.570 --> 10:14.781
Hey, man, "can't" is a four-letter word
in this platoon.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.492
I cannot violate regulations,
unless it's an order...

10:17.701 --> 10:21.788
...in which case I would have to ask
Master Sergeant Bilko to sign said order.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.250
I'm asking you to do Tony here a favour.
We're all like family here.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.461
Any one of these men
would take a bullet for you.

10:27.628 --> 10:31.548
- Well, not in the chest.
- No, not in the chest, but in the thigh.

10:31.715 --> 10:36.220
- Permission to speak freely?
- What, are we in Russia? Say anything.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.889
You're soldiers. Guardians of freedom.

10:39.056 --> 10:44.311
And frankly, I don't think there's a man
here taking his service oath seriously.

10:44.478 --> 10:47.147
You know what? I'm gonna kill him.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.650
Fender!

10:53.820 --> 10:56.907
<i>Now, this is the stuff
they should be teaching in the army.</i>

10:57.074 --> 11:00.327
- They are.
- No kidding?

11:03.831 --> 11:08.877
Here's a mouldy oldie
for all our friends in the motor pool.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
<i>("No Particular Place to Go"
by Chuck Berry)</i>

11:12.339 --> 11:15.676
<i>Ridin' along in my automobile</i>

11:15.843 --> 11:19.429
<i>My baby beside me at the wheel</i>

11:19.638 --> 11:21.932
<i>I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile</i>

11:22.099 --> 11:23.267
Brass!

11:23.433 --> 11:26.854
<i>My curiosity runnin' wild</i>

11:27.020 --> 11:30.524
<i>Cruisin' and playin' the radio</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:34.278
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

11:34.444 --> 11:38.031
<i>Ridin' along in my automobile</i>

11:38.198 --> 11:41.702
<i>I was anxious to tell her the way I feel</i>

11:41.869 --> 11:45.372
<i>So I told her softly and sincere</i>

11:45.539 --> 11:49.293
<i>And she leaned and whispered in my ear</i>

11:49.459 --> 11:53.046
<i>Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:54.298
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

11:54.464 --> 11:58.969
- Sarge, where can we hide the horse?
- What horse?

12:02.639 --> 12:07.311
All right, men! Faster.
The army needs these vehicles.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.399
Bilko?

12:14.985 --> 12:16.737
Sergeant.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.739
Sergeant Bilko!

12:18.906 --> 12:22.659
Fall in, men, now! And get
into a semicircle or a rectangle, now!

12:22.826 --> 12:25.245
Hut! Hey!

12:35.088 --> 12:38.258
Very good. As you were.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.427
He means go back to
what you were doing.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.014
Colonel Hall, you look fantastic, sir.
Have you lost weight?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.934
Why, a couple of pounds maybe.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.019
Nell and I have been
"sweating to the oldies".

12:49.186 --> 12:52.439
- Ah.
- Sergeant, I'm here to see about my car.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.192
Ah, well, I'm afraid
we're still working on it, sir.

12:55.359 --> 12:59.029
- You've had it a week and a half.
- I thought I saw it on Interstate 30.

12:59.196 --> 13:02.366
There. Thank God I have a witness.
Thank you, Captain Moon.

13:02.533 --> 13:05.285
And the colonel thinks
I never test-drive the vehicles.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.454
What is that?

13:07.621 --> 13:10.874
That's horse shit, sir. I tell the men
"You have to test-drive..."

13:11.041 --> 13:13.710
- What's it doing there?
- It keeps the flies off the food.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.630
There's no way you can tell
what's wrong with an engine...

13:16.797 --> 13:18.715
- Off the food?
- It's an experiment.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.386
I'd say the results are mixed.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.893
It's a lot cheaper than
sending out for it, sir.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.229
And fresher too.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.982
Bilko, are you mental?
This is not the horse cavalry.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.402
- You can't bring livestock onto the post.
- You're right, sir.

13:38.569 --> 13:42.155
You heard the colonel. Assemble horse
platoon and get the horse out of here!

13:42.322 --> 13:47.661
- All right, double-time, soldier.
- Sergeant, please, tell me about my car.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.913
- Do you know anything about cars, sir?
- No.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.585
Ah. Well, you see that
sort of pointy thing right there?

13:54.751 --> 13:59.006
It seems that it's impinging on the
browned, round thing with the spots.

13:59.173 --> 14:03.510
- You see, when Henry Ford first...
- Colonel Hall.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.430
- Corporal, what is it?
- Permission to speak privately?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.849
- Of course. Excuse me, Bilko.
- Absolutely.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.518
- What is it, Corporal?
- The Pentagon called.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.605
The Pentagon?
How did they get my number?

14:14.771 --> 14:18.525
They're sending a team
to observe tomorrow's hovertank test.

14:18.692 --> 14:23.530
- Why? It's just a preliminary... Aah.
- What is it, sir?

14:24.114 --> 14:27.284
Well, they're closing
a lot of military facilities lately.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.620
What if they're planning
to close Fort Baxter?

14:29.786 --> 14:32.623
- Do you know anything about this?
- You flatter me.

14:32.789 --> 14:37.711
- How could l, a mere master sergeant...?
- You know everything before I do.

14:37.878 --> 14:42.799
I'm sure it's just routine, sir.
Anyway, come back any time. Call first.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.637
I tell you, men, serving under
a great leader like Colonel Hall...

14:46.803 --> 14:48.555
- He's gone.
- I'm hungry. What time is it?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.891
12 o'clock. We ordered Chinese.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.645
- Pentagon brass, Sarge? I don't like it.
- Relax. It's just army stuff.

14:54.811 --> 14:57.481
It's got nothing to do with us.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.900
- Did you say 12 o'clock?
- Yeah.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.236
- Today's Saturday?
- All day.

15:02.402 --> 15:07.991
Saturday at noon. I have a strange feeling
I'm supposed to be somewhere.

15:09.910 --> 15:10.994
Hmm.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.080
<i>(organ plays)</i>

15:13.247 --> 15:15.999
I'll kill him.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.677
- Poker game?
- No, no.

15:26.844 --> 15:31.098
- Racetrack.
- No, no. It was something else.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.935
<i>(sighs)</i>

15:35.102 --> 15:37.688
My, that's a lovely dress.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.107
- Thank you, Reverend.
- Is it new?

15:40.274 --> 15:43.861
No, I wore it the last time
the lying shit-heel stood me up.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.195
Ah.

15:45.362 --> 15:48.448
<i>(brakes screech)</i>

16:00.544 --> 16:03.463
<i>(horn blares)</i>

16:07.467 --> 16:10.053
Give me the ring.
You were the best man last time.

16:10.220 --> 16:13.140
- He didn't get married last time!
- It's my turn!

16:13.307 --> 16:17.978
- How you gonna be best man?
- Just give me the ring!

16:20.314 --> 16:24.067
- But you can't hate him, you know?
- I can hate him. I hate him right now.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.904
Sweetheart...

16:27.404 --> 16:30.073
Where are you going? Nobody leave.

16:30.240 --> 16:36.330
You came to see me get married. You're
going to - I don't particularly care who to.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.082
Sweetheart! I know you're upset...

16:39.249 --> 16:42.836
Daddy, stay out of this.
I know what I'm doing.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.505
- Nelson.
- Huh?

16:44.671 --> 16:47.591
Are you busy? Will you
marry me? I love you.

16:47.758 --> 16:51.011
I just never realised it until now.

16:51.178 --> 16:55.933
Well, the thing is, Rita,
I'm engaged... to your sister.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.353
And?

17:03.941 --> 17:06.777
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

17:13.700 --> 17:16.954
Don't ask. Don't even ask.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.624
OK, ask.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.126
Bunny face,
you won't believe what happened.

17:23.292 --> 17:28.549
There was this busload of sweet geriatrics.
They went rolling down a mountain side...

17:28.715 --> 17:30.968
Do you think I'm an idiot?

17:31.134 --> 17:37.140
Ask Wally. He's new, a real straight arrow,
never told a lie in his life. Wally?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.726
See?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.145
Sweetheart, sweetheart...

17:42.312 --> 17:44.815
Oh, baby... angel puff, you're overreacting!

17:44.982 --> 17:49.236
- You know, it's... Ooh! Bad turnout.
- It was full an hour ago.

17:49.361 --> 17:53.156
<i>Oh, sweetie, I... (gasps) I'm well!</i>

17:53.323 --> 17:55.409
Sweetie, what can I do
to make it up to you?

17:55.576 --> 17:57.828
Whaddaya want? Just tell me.
I'll do anything.

17:57.995 --> 18:00.247
I've been waiting for seven years.

18:00.455 --> 18:04.877
What do I want? I want my seven years
back. I can't live like this, Ernie.

18:05.002 --> 18:07.671
I've got a maid of honour
on call 24 hours a day.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.759
And I'm the only woman with a wedding
dress that's falling apart from wear.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.971
- I'm sorry.
- I think you love me, Ernie.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.267
But you're so slippery, it's impossible
to know what you're thinking.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.269
Well, thank you.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.772
I don't understand
what you're so afraid of.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.692
You know what I wanna do
right here, right now?

18:28.859 --> 18:31.320
No. Don't.

18:33.864 --> 18:36.950
No. No, not this time.

18:37.201 --> 18:40.996
- Don't, please.
- One game, to 500.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.541
Don't. Please don't.

18:45.042 --> 18:48.128
Spade. It's a double.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.381
Triple boxes, to 500. Penny a point.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.301
- A four?
- Yes.

18:55.385 --> 18:59.473
Oh, two. Yeah. Come on. Here. Go, go, go.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.900
What's up?

19:10.317 --> 19:14.738
Well, Rocky and I were talkin' to Wally
while you and Rita were in the church.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.574
She's a nice girl.
We don't like the way you treat her.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.077
He's right, Sarge.
You treat her like a rube.

19:20.244 --> 19:23.455
- Wouldn't you be happier in the navy?
- You jilted that girl.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.833
She'll probably have to
move to another town.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.752
Will you relax? Rita and I
have a special relationship.

19:28.919 --> 19:31.922
You think she expected me
to marry her today? Of course not.

19:32.089 --> 19:34.925
She expected me to do
just what I did. It's a game.

19:35.092 --> 19:39.096
Someday you might lose that game, Ernie.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.370
Very good, men. Make sure it's tight.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.206
- Tight?
- Whatever.

20:06.331 --> 20:09.459
So, Major Ebersole,
tomorrow's the big day.

20:09.626 --> 20:13.380
- How's she look?
- I hope it won't be too humiliating, sir.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.132
What's supposed to happen?

20:15.299 --> 20:19.511
Well, theoretically,
and I wouldn't bet the farm...

20:19.720 --> 20:24.975
...the hovertank will lift off and hover
several inches above the pond.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.979
- Good. Very good.
- Yeah. Then it will engage the targets...

20:29.146 --> 20:32.816
...the... the cannon. Boom.
The ammunition dump. Kaboom.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.152
That truck. Boom.

20:35.277 --> 20:39.406
Excellent. One thought.
Maybe it should be: boom, boom...

20:39.573 --> 20:42.409
<i>... then kaboom.</i>

20:42.576 --> 20:46.747
You know, save that "kaboom" for the very
last? Kind of like a "hoo-ah" grand finale.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.833
What do you think?

20:50.542 --> 20:54.463
- I'll make a note of it, sir.
- Good.

20:55.172 --> 20:58.008
- Missed me. Now run!
- Ow!

20:58.175 --> 21:00.594
- Yeah. Gotcha.
- Hey, there goes the sarge, man.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.930
Sarge!

21:03.096 --> 21:06.517
- Hey, Dobie, come on, let's go.
- Sarge, you get married yet?

21:06.683 --> 21:09.686
- Not yet.
- How did Rita take it this time?

21:09.853 --> 21:12.022
Oh, she's happy. She took
40 bucks off me in a gin game.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.440
Oh, she's great!

21:13.607 --> 21:16.985
Paparelli. How's tickets goin' for the
"Meet Stormin' Norman" barbecue?

21:17.194 --> 21:19.196
- It's a sellout, Sarge.
- Find a lookalike?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.114
- We found one.
- Ahh.

21:21.281 --> 21:25.035
No wonder they call me
a master sergeant.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.371
You know, things weren't
always this good.

21:27.538 --> 21:31.792
When I first got my stripes at Fort Dix,
I considered it my responsibility...

21:32.000 --> 21:37.714
...to provide the hardworking men and
women with some wholesome recreation.

21:38.048 --> 21:41.218
- You ran the gambling.
- That's right, Fender.

21:41.385 --> 21:46.431
But there was this lieutenant there -
Lieutenant Colin Thorn.

21:47.641 --> 21:52.729
<i>A lunatic. I mean, real smooth on
the outside, but underneath, barbed wire.</i>

21:52.896 --> 21:54.773
<i>He rode me like a jockey.</i>

21:54.982 --> 21:57.776
<i>Pools, raffles, card games -
I couldn't do anything.</i>

21:57.985 --> 22:01.321
<i>It was like being in the army.</i>

22:01.488 --> 22:05.826
<i>(Bilko) All right, come on, baby. Let's go!</i>

22:07.286 --> 22:08.745
Hi.

22:08.912 --> 22:12.374
<i>Finally, I got a break. They held
the division boxing finals at our post.</i>

22:12.583 --> 22:15.836
<i>You couldn't stop people
from betting on it.</i>

22:16.044 --> 22:19.298
<i>It was a toss-up.
Now, to me, that's just sloppy.</i>

22:19.423 --> 22:25.679
I like a sporting event in which I know the
outcome beforehand. It's more organised.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.600
<i>(bike bell rings)</i>

22:31.351 --> 22:34.771
<i>I get to one of the pugilists
and we reach a business accommodation.</i>

22:34.938 --> 22:36.857
<i>For a 50-50 split of our winnings...</i>

22:37.024 --> 22:40.527
<i>... he agrees to give less than
a supreme effort in the squared circle.</i>

22:40.652 --> 22:45.616
<i>- (Rocky) You paid him to take a dive.
- (Bilko) 0f course.</i>

22:45.782 --> 22:50.621
<i>I had this corporal
working for me - Leo Cletz.</i>

22:59.546 --> 23:02.549
<i>The night of the fight, I give him
the money to pay off my fighter.</i>

23:02.716 --> 23:08.222
<i>Leo misunderstands and gives
the money to the other fighter.</i>

23:09.056 --> 23:13.894
<i>This fighter's surprised, but figures "What
the heck? It's a good price. I'll go down."</i>

23:14.061 --> 23:17.314
Meanwhile, my guy figures
"Bilko meant I'll get the money later."

23:17.481 --> 23:21.151
- "No problem. I'll go down anyway."
- So both think they're takin' a dive?

23:21.318 --> 23:23.904
- Exactly.
- What happened?

23:24.071 --> 23:26.824
Boxing history.

23:49.930 --> 23:55.435
<i>For three rounds, nobody hit anybody.
It was a dance recital.</i>

24:11.535 --> 24:17.624
<i>Finally, I think out of boredom,
one of the guys connected with a right.</i>

24:20.127 --> 24:23.630
What the hell's goin' on here?

24:24.214 --> 24:26.967
<i>Lieutenant Thorn took it
as a personal insult.</i>

24:27.134 --> 24:30.888
- You OK? Did it hurt?
- Very cute.

24:39.229 --> 24:42.983
<i>It looked like Thorn
was paying off the fighter.</i>

24:43.150 --> 24:44.735
<i>He was cooked.</i>

24:44.902 --> 24:49.489
<i>They didn't have enough evidence for a
court martial, but sent him to Greenland.</i>

24:54.828 --> 24:58.499
<i>Game, set and match - Bilko.</i>

24:58.916 --> 25:01.251
- Some story, huh?
- Permission to speak freely?

25:01.418 --> 25:05.589
- Again, permission. OK.
- You dealt with him very dishonestly.

25:05.756 --> 25:08.258
Never mind that.
What happened to him? Thorn.

25:08.425 --> 25:12.846
I don't know. I don't know
what happened to him.

25:30.030 --> 25:35.536
Colonel John Hall, garrison commander.
Welcome to Fort Baxter, Major.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.377
<i>(bugle plays reveille)</i>

25:50.384 --> 25:53.136
<i>(snoring)</i>

26:00.561 --> 26:02.729
Doberman! Wake up!

26:02.896 --> 26:06.066
<i>(coughs and snorts)</i>

26:11.738 --> 26:15.242
<i>(bugle repeats reveille)</i>

26:15.659 --> 26:18.328
<i>(snoring)</i>

26:38.515 --> 26:41.101
Come on, everyone!
Up and at 'em!

26:41.268 --> 26:43.187
<i>(all groan)</i>

26:43.353 --> 26:46.857
Come on, guys, let's not miss
one minute of this beautiful day.

26:47.024 --> 26:49.276
Hey!

26:49.860 --> 26:52.946
- Get outta here!
- I'll get the sarge!

26:53.113 --> 26:55.699
That's it. Now you guys
gonna be in trouble.

26:55.866 --> 26:58.619
<i>(reveille)</i>

27:03.707 --> 27:05.626
- Hey, Sarge! Get up.
- What's the matter?

27:05.792 --> 27:11.381
Everybody take cover! Gather all the men!
Man the battle stations and...

27:11.715 --> 27:14.635
What's that music?

27:25.729 --> 27:29.566
I understand, Major, this weapon system
is in the experimental stage.

27:29.733 --> 27:33.237
But I think you'll be very impressed
with the... noise it produces.

27:33.403 --> 27:36.156
It's a powerful piece of equipment.

27:36.323 --> 27:39.827
Colonel, I really urge you
not to go ahead with this.

27:39.993 --> 27:42.830
Ah, Major Ebersole, Major Thorn.

27:42.996 --> 27:45.833
Major Ebersole is the brain
behind the hovertank.

27:45.999 --> 27:49.837
<i>He's the one really responsible.</i>

27:50.003 --> 27:52.256
- Thank you, sir.
- Can we get on with this?

27:52.422 --> 27:54.758
Of course. You good to go?

27:54.925 --> 27:58.345
All right. Let's light this candle.

27:58.512 --> 28:00.848
Hoo-ah!

28:01.265 --> 28:07.020
You know, with all the base closings and
downsizing, people here have been jumpy.

28:07.187 --> 28:09.439
Ready, Colonel.

28:09.606 --> 28:13.110
<i>(Hall) This is exciting.</i>

28:23.871 --> 28:26.707
OK, start her up.

28:34.381 --> 28:37.134
<i>(rattling)</i>

28:45.976 --> 28:48.979
It still needs work.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.917
Fire.

29:14.338 --> 29:16.840
Of course.

29:18.509 --> 29:21.428
Get out! Watch out!

29:50.707 --> 29:55.295
Let's go, campers! It's 10am.
Time to start the day.

29:56.964 --> 29:59.216
- Mornin', Sarge.
- It's that time of the decade.

29:59.383 --> 30:01.301
- You're taking a shower.
- Do I have to?

30:01.468 --> 30:06.473
Everyone feels pretty strongly about it.
Here's the petition.

30:06.723 --> 30:09.226
Aw, Sarge.

30:11.228 --> 30:13.981
Why are you sitting there?
You were full of energy at 6am.

30:14.147 --> 30:15.983
I don't think the guys like me.

30:16.149 --> 30:19.403
- Oh? What makes you say that?
- They wrote me a note.

30:19.570 --> 30:24.158
"Wally, we don't like you."
And they all signed it.

30:25.492 --> 30:29.163
- Yeah, that's Doberman's "X".
- Can I please have another roommate?

30:29.329 --> 30:31.248
- Why, what's the matter?
- He wet his bed.

30:31.415 --> 30:36.753
- Oh, well, once in a while.
- No. He did it from across the room.

30:38.672 --> 30:41.425
Major, please! At least
won't you stay for lunch?

30:41.592 --> 30:43.927
- Do you like chicken casserole?
- No.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.597
Well, Major, let me be frank.

30:46.763 --> 30:50.267
A negative report from you would be
the death knell for Fort Baxter.

30:50.434 --> 30:53.770
- We've been in a slump...
- Nine years without a successful test?

30:53.937 --> 30:56.106
That's not a slump, that's a tradition.

30:56.273 --> 31:00.277
But, Major, think for a minute
about the men, their careers.

31:00.444 --> 31:03.113
<i>- My career.
- Colonel, you play the hand you're dealt.</i>

31:03.280 --> 31:06.033
This isn't the career
I had in mind when I got out of OCS.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.869
Shining a seat with my ass in DC,
visiting dumpy posts.

31:09.036 --> 31:11.455
I thought I'd be a colonel by now
or maybe a general.

31:11.622 --> 31:15.626
Sorry. What I saw today was a dust cloud
that cost $70 million. Good morning.

31:15.792 --> 31:20.380
Wait! There's a lot more to
Fort Baxter than just R&D, Major.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.550
- We have an award-winning commissary.
- Try the casserole.

31:23.717 --> 31:26.053
And our softball team won
the division title.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.889
And Sergeant Bilko's platoon
is in the glee club finals.

31:29.056 --> 31:32.726
I'll certainly keep that in mind.

31:39.900 --> 31:42.819
Did you say Bilko?

31:43.070 --> 31:44.905
Yeah.

31:45.072 --> 31:48.325
<i>Is that Ernie Bilko?</i>

31:48.492 --> 31:51.328
One and the same.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.831
Maybe I will stay for lunch.

31:53.997 --> 31:57.334
Well, hoo-ah! Ignite that
chicken casserole, Captain Moon!

31:57.501 --> 31:59.920
Yes, sir!

32:13.600 --> 32:16.937
Now, where did that one go?

32:30.117 --> 32:32.953
- Hey, you're eight over par, Sarge!
- Well, fix it.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.123
- Sarge, they let you do this?
- I never asked. They'd say no.

32:36.290 --> 32:37.708
It is an army post.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.794
<i>(dog barking)</i>

32:45.465 --> 32:48.552
All right, I got 5-1 on Lover's Knot.

32:48.719 --> 32:52.806
- $20 says I can hit the parking lot.
- I don't gamble.

32:52.973 --> 32:55.225
<i>- What is it you do do?
- Permission to speak...</i>

32:55.392 --> 32:57.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

32:57.227 --> 33:00.898
I get up every morning and I get dressed
to protect the American way of life.

33:01.064 --> 33:05.152
Would you tell me that later tonight
so I don't have to take a sleeping pill?

33:05.319 --> 33:07.070
<i>(Thorn) Bilko!</i>

33:07.237 --> 33:09.656
<i>(whispers) It can't be.</i>

33:09.823 --> 33:12.409
Lieutenant Thorn.

33:12.576 --> 33:17.498
- Actually, it's Major Thorn now.
- Well, congratulations.

33:18.582 --> 33:22.503
I didn't know you were still in the service.
I'd have looked you up long ago.

33:22.669 --> 33:23.587
I'll bet.

33:23.754 --> 33:27.758
Tell me, Colonel, is he still
the same rascal he was at Fort Dix?

33:27.925 --> 33:30.761
- That's one way of putting it.
- You changed my life.

33:30.928 --> 33:33.680
Remember that little boxing match?

33:33.847 --> 33:35.766
Boxing match... Hmm.

33:35.933 --> 33:39.937
That made me a new man. You remember
how stiff and uptight I used to be?

33:40.103 --> 33:42.940
Thanks to him, I realised
you can't treat people that way.

33:43.106 --> 33:45.526
I'm a better man for it. Thanks, Ernie.

33:45.692 --> 33:48.946
<i>- Sure.
- (dogs barking)</i>

33:49.112 --> 33:50.864
- What was that?
- Greyhounds, sir.

33:51.031 --> 33:53.534
- How long will you be with us, Major?
- Not long.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.203
Colonel, what do you say
we have that casserole?

33:56.370 --> 33:59.206
Absolutely, and some jellied yams as well.

33:59.373 --> 34:01.542
Ha.

34:03.043 --> 34:09.132
Let's get back to the barracks and cancel
everything-dances, raffles, everything.

34:30.737 --> 34:34.408
God, I forgot it's the play-offs!

34:34.658 --> 34:37.161
Sarge! Here's the money
from the blade rentals.

34:37.327 --> 34:41.331
Stop, stop! Put that away!
Stop, everyone! Stop!

34:41.498 --> 34:45.002
<i>Ridin' along in my automobile</i>

34:45.168 --> 34:48.589
<i>My baby beside me at the wheel</i>

34:48.755 --> 34:52.259
<i>I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile</i>

34:52.426 --> 34:55.679
It's Hall with Major Thorn.
Looks like a surprise inspection.

34:55.846 --> 34:59.766
An inspection? Now? Look at this place!

34:59.933 --> 35:02.436
<i>- ETA, 90 seconds.
- (Bilko) Think. Think.</i>

35:02.603 --> 35:05.189
I've got to think. Where's Alpha company?

35:05.355 --> 35:07.274
Field exercises.

35:07.441 --> 35:11.111
<i>So we parked way out on the Kokomo</i>

35:11.278 --> 35:14.531
<i>The night was young
and the moon was gold</i>

35:14.698 --> 35:18.702
<i>So we both decided to take a stroll</i>

35:18.869 --> 35:22.206
<i>Can you imagine the way I felt?</i>

35:22.372 --> 35:25.876
<i>I couldn't unfasten her safety belt</i>

35:26.043 --> 35:29.630
<i>Cruisin' and playin' the radio</i>

35:29.796 --> 35:33.550
<i>With no particular place to go</i>

35:42.392 --> 35:45.562
Um, which way are we...

35:46.313 --> 35:48.106
...facing here?

35:48.315 --> 35:52.569
Uh, well... it would
have to be this one here.

35:54.488 --> 35:57.825
Over hill, over dale
we have hit the dusty trail

35:58.033 --> 36:01.495
As those caissons go rolling along

36:01.662 --> 36:05.582
And it's hi, hi, hee in the field artillery

36:05.749 --> 36:07.918
<i>(Hall) Bilko.</i>

36:08.085 --> 36:10.921
Ten-hut, platoon!

36:13.674 --> 36:16.510
- Major Thorn wants to see the barracks.
- An inspection?

36:16.677 --> 36:19.263
I wish we had a little more time.
We're not prepared.

36:19.429 --> 36:23.308
It just gives me a thrill to see what a
first-rate top kick can do with a platoon.

36:23.433 --> 36:26.436
- Why don't they stand by their rooms?
- Certainly. Sergeant?

36:26.603 --> 36:30.357
Really, sir, if the glee club misses
practice, I won't be responsible...

36:30.524 --> 36:34.778
- I said now!
- Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut!

36:42.202 --> 36:44.288
- Is this your room, soldier?
- Yes, sir.

36:44.413 --> 36:46.957
Follow me.

36:56.133 --> 36:58.635
Who's this?

36:59.553 --> 37:04.141
<i>It's the cast of my favourite TV show, sir:
The African-American Hour.</i>

37:04.308 --> 37:06.393
Oh? I've never heard of it.

37:06.560 --> 37:11.523
It's on cable. See, it's funny,
but it also makes you think.

37:12.900 --> 37:15.235
Ah. Hm.

37:40.844 --> 37:43.764
<i>(toy squeaks)</i>

37:51.396 --> 37:53.857
Are these yours?

37:54.024 --> 37:59.738
It is my understanding that you can
no longer ask me these questions, sir.

38:00.614 --> 38:02.783
It's a new army, Major.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.953
We're all adjusting.

38:14.962 --> 38:17.631
<i>(sniffs)</i>

38:20.592 --> 38:22.177
- Whose bunk is this?
- Uh, mine, sir.

38:22.302 --> 38:26.223
- That corner is not squared off!
- What? I told you to make this bunk!

38:26.390 --> 38:31.812
Now, I don't want any of your excuses!
Now, drop and give me 20! Ha!

38:33.647 --> 38:35.148
<i>(grunts)</i>

38:35.315 --> 38:38.735
All right. One. We're going for one.

38:38.861 --> 38:41.071
Colonel, you're a very courageous man.

38:41.196 --> 38:44.324
Oh! I saw a little combat duty in Kor...

38:44.491 --> 38:46.410
Courageous? What do you mean?

38:46.577 --> 38:50.080
Thumbing your nose at army regulations.
But I guess your men come first.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.458
- And 20.
- My men? First?

38:53.667 --> 38:56.670
- What does he mean, Bilko?
- This soldier, sir.

38:56.837 --> 39:00.507
I'd say he's about 50 pounds
over his maximum allowable weight.

39:00.674 --> 39:04.386
What are the chances of that being
discovered and your being blamed?

39:04.511 --> 39:06.221
Blamed?

39:06.430 --> 39:09.266
Sergeant, I want him
at regulation weight in six weeks.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.935
Yes, sir!

39:26.783 --> 39:29.786
Adelaide, of course
we'll get married, sooner or later.

39:29.953 --> 39:34.374
Nathan Detroit, after 14 years,
it is already too late to be sooner.

39:34.541 --> 39:38.879
I'm from Rhode Island, where people
do not remain engaged for 14 years.

39:39.087 --> 39:43.717
- They get married.
- Then why is it such a small state?

39:43.884 --> 39:46.470
Miss Robbins. I don't get it.

39:46.637 --> 39:50.974
Why would Adelaide stick around if he,
like, disses her all the time?

39:51.141 --> 39:53.727
Doesn't she have any self-esteem?

39:53.936 --> 39:57.981
Well, that's a very interesting question.

39:58.106 --> 40:02.528
<i>- (Bilko) Certainly is.
- Ernie! What are you doing here?</i>

40:02.653 --> 40:04.613
- Did you get the flowers I sent ya?
- No.

40:04.822 --> 40:08.158
Darn. I'll call FedEx
and have 'em put a trace on it.

40:08.325 --> 40:11.495
That's right, sweetheart.
Nathan's a hustler.

40:11.662 --> 40:14.498
He's irresponsible,
and he's careless with the truth.

40:14.665 --> 40:18.502
But the one thing he never lies about
is how much he cares for Adelaide.

40:18.669 --> 40:21.046
See, that's his core, and she knows it.

40:21.255 --> 40:26.510
OK, let's take a break for ten minutes.
And that was really good.

40:26.677 --> 40:29.179
Wonderful.

40:32.683 --> 40:37.855
Ernie, I've been thinking, and I don't think
we should see each other any more.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.858
Sweetheart, you promised to go
to the Rusty Spur with me.

40:41.024 --> 40:45.112
- You never give up, do you?
- Come on. Come on, sweetheart...

40:45.279 --> 40:49.783
...go to the Rusty Spur with me.
It'd be like old times.

40:49.950 --> 40:54.621
All right, but you've got 30 days.
If this finger is still naked in 30 days...

40:54.788 --> 40:57.541
...it's adios, Pepe.

40:57.708 --> 41:02.045
I mean it this time.
This is your last chance.

41:27.905 --> 41:30.240
Major. I'm Lieutenant Oster and this is...

41:30.407 --> 41:34.578
Lieutenant Monday. We're here
from the Inspector General's Office, sir.

41:34.745 --> 41:39.166
I asked for the best number crunchers
in the army! I hope that's what they sent!

41:39.333 --> 41:42.503
- If there's been any malfeasance...
- Or embezzlement...

41:42.628 --> 41:43.837
We will find it.

41:44.004 --> 41:47.591
This guy we're going after's
been feeding off the khaki tit for years.

41:47.758 --> 41:52.554
He's a master sergeant.
His name is Ernie Bilko. Get him!

41:55.390 --> 41:58.185
- Forget it, Bilko.
- But, sir, the moment my boys heard...

41:58.352 --> 42:01.021
...about the desert manoeuvre,
they volunteered.

42:01.146 --> 42:04.024
We still haven't got over
being left out of Desert Storm.

42:04.191 --> 42:06.610
How the orders got crisscrossed,
I'll never know.

42:06.777 --> 42:10.614
But if we could go on these manoeuvres,
it would make up, in some small way...

42:10.781 --> 42:12.616
You must think I'm a nincompoop.

42:12.783 --> 42:15.619
A nincompoop? An NCP?
On the contrary, sir.

42:15.786 --> 42:18.121
- I think you're one of the finest...
- Las Vegas.

42:18.330 --> 42:20.958
- What, sir?
- The desert manoeuvre will take place...

42:21.124 --> 42:23.460
...15 miles from Las Vegas, Nevada.

42:23.627 --> 42:26.296
Really? I had no idea. Won't that be fun?

42:26.463 --> 42:30.717
- Lake Mead, Hoover Dam.
- Forget it. You've got bigger problems.

42:30.843 --> 42:35.013
Two hatchet men -
excuse me, hatchet persons -

42:35.222 --> 42:38.684
...from the Inspector General's Office
came to audit the motor pool accounts.

42:38.809 --> 42:43.230
- I wonder who tipped them off?
- Yes, I wonder.

42:43.397 --> 42:46.483
<i>(woman) Fort Baxter. How may I
direct your call? Motor pool?</i>

42:46.650 --> 42:51.446
Listen, Bilko, I might tell you this whole
post is skating on thin ice with hot blades.

42:51.655 --> 42:53.574
Don't let them find anything.

42:53.782 --> 42:56.660
- Is the colonel suggesting a cover-up?
- A cover-up?

42:56.827 --> 43:00.664
Why, no. Is there... anything to cover up?

43:00.831 --> 43:03.333
No... sir.

43:04.501 --> 43:07.504
Good. Then I'm not suggesting one.

43:07.629 --> 43:12.759
Just do... whatever it is you do
to make these things go away.

43:14.261 --> 43:17.097
<i>I can't help myself</i>

43:17.264 --> 43:20.017
<i>Bad habits</i>

43:20.392 --> 43:23.103
<i>I'm runnin' wild</i>

43:23.270 --> 43:26.106
<i>Lost control</i>

43:26.648 --> 43:29.610
<i>Well, I must confess</i>

43:29.776 --> 43:33.030
<i>Cos I can't repress</i>

43:33.447 --> 43:37.075
In the last two months you
billed the army for 72 windshields?

43:37.284 --> 43:40.370
That was a mistake.
One of my men, Private Buttersworth...

43:40.537 --> 43:42.706
...had a hairline crack in his glasses.

43:42.873 --> 43:44.625
- A crack?
- Yes, a hairline crack.

43:44.791 --> 43:47.711
So to him, it looked like
all the windshields were broken.

43:47.878 --> 43:50.547
I transferred him right out.
That's the way I am.

43:50.714 --> 43:55.969
She's crazy about you. Every time
you're not looking, she stares.

43:58.805 --> 44:01.808
You just missed it.

44:06.522 --> 44:11.318
Sergeant, in the past two days we've
found a number of possible irregularities.

44:11.485 --> 44:15.823
- Now, if you can't produce receipts...
- She's staring at you again.

44:15.989 --> 44:18.242
Oh, just missed it!

44:18.408 --> 44:20.160
There.

44:20.327 --> 44:23.330
<i>... that a boy like me</i>

44:23.455 --> 44:27.000
<i>Has got so many bad habits</i>

44:29.461 --> 44:33.257
<i>I said, all of these bad habits</i>

44:36.426 --> 44:39.888
<i>All of these bad habits</i>

44:45.894 --> 44:48.689
<i>(bells ring)</i>

44:51.900 --> 44:53.610
Nothing? You found nothing?

44:53.777 --> 44:56.196
All my training tells me
he's hiding something.

44:56.321 --> 44:59.032
Every time we're about to
find something...

44:59.199 --> 45:02.703
It dissolves. - It's like trying
to nail Jell-O to the wall.

45:02.828 --> 45:06.623
- No. It's like watching a magician.
- He's got you watching his left hand...

45:06.790 --> 45:09.626
And his right hand keeps pullin' rabbits!

45:09.793 --> 45:13.380
Well, then, let's tie his hands.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.134
Ernie, will you dance with me tonight?

45:17.301 --> 45:20.554
That's up to you. Last time,
I accidentally stepped on your knee.

45:20.721 --> 45:23.056
- What if they play our song?
- We have a song?

45:23.182 --> 45:25.267
Don't you remember the first time we...?

45:25.392 --> 45:27.728
Only you

45:27.853 --> 45:30.814
How could I forget our song?
When they play it tonight...

45:30.981 --> 45:35.235
...you and I will dance the most romantic
dance we've ever danced in our entire life.

45:35.402 --> 45:40.073
- You promise?
- That's a promise from Ernest G Bilko.

45:40.991 --> 45:44.495
Put some drive in your country

45:44.745 --> 45:47.915
Keep country drivin' on

45:50.000 --> 45:53.504
When the music gets you movin'

45:53.837 --> 45:55.672
You know it can't be long

45:55.839 --> 45:59.593
Baby, this is our night. Just us. Just
you and me. All night long. No soldiers.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.845
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's shoot some pool.

46:02.012 --> 46:05.933
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, Sarge. You're late!

46:06.683 --> 46:11.688
- We want to celebrate the audit with ya.
- Those bean counters didn't have a clue.

46:11.855 --> 46:15.859
I know, I know. Sometimes
I'm so damn good I scare myself.

46:16.026 --> 46:18.695
Just us, huh?

46:20.614 --> 46:23.951
If you see her out tonight

46:24.785 --> 46:28.956
And she tells you
that it's just the lights

46:29.957 --> 46:31.959
That bring her here

46:32.125 --> 46:35.212
And not her loneliness

46:38.966 --> 46:41.552
That's what she says...

46:41.718 --> 46:45.806
- I'll go get us a couple of drinks.
- OK.

46:54.648 --> 46:57.401
...every word she says

46:57.568 --> 47:00.904
A scorpion and a brandy alexander.

47:01.071 --> 47:03.907
That's what she says...

47:04.074 --> 47:06.410
The future
Mrs "Permission to Speak Freely"?

47:06.577 --> 47:10.581
Oh, no. I mean, I don't know her.
I never even... I don't know her.

47:10.747 --> 47:13.584
<i>(music ends)</i>

47:14.168 --> 47:17.921
Thank you very much, everybody.
we'll be back in just a couple of minutes.

47:18.088 --> 47:19.923
- I'll introduce ya.
- You know her?

47:20.090 --> 47:22.342
- No.
- She's with someone.

47:22.509 --> 47:25.012
A detail.

47:27.931 --> 47:31.185
- Ah, you must be in Bravo company.
- No, Charlie company.

47:31.351 --> 47:33.604
- Charlie Company! Haven't you heard?
- What?

47:33.770 --> 47:36.273
You're shipping out -
Operation Vacuum Cleaner.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.609
- Operation...
- Shh!

47:38.775 --> 47:42.029
I want his name. I want it known
that in this moment of crisis...

47:42.196 --> 47:44.781
...this man chose to sit here
and eat bar nuts.

47:44.948 --> 47:49.953
- I didn't know!
- Go ye into the night! Hut, hut, hut, hut!

47:50.787 --> 47:54.374
All right. Now I'll settle this.

47:54.541 --> 47:56.543
- Hmm.
- Excuse me?

47:56.710 --> 48:00.380
You were right. Those are
the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen.

48:00.547 --> 48:02.299
- Did he say that?
- Oh, yeah.

48:02.466 --> 48:05.886
He said your eyes were like diamonds
sparkling on a summer night.

48:06.053 --> 48:10.474
The old sergeant's eyes didn't see what
he saw. Anyway, here's the $20 I bet you.

48:10.641 --> 48:15.395
I think the least you can do is sit down
and buy this young lady some dinner.

48:15.562 --> 48:18.398
Sit down and buy dinner! Go! Hey!

48:18.565 --> 48:21.401
Ah, to be young again.

48:21.568 --> 48:24.905
- That's my sergeant.
- Oh.

48:30.661 --> 48:33.080
Oh! Major Ebersole, boys.
Welcome to the Spur.

48:33.247 --> 48:37.584
Oh, I've been here before.
Uh... five years ago.

48:37.918 --> 48:40.587
I had... a scotch and soda.

48:40.754 --> 48:43.423
Good. A place like this
depends on repeat business.

48:43.590 --> 48:48.595
They're repainting our club, so we had to
move our weekly poker game down here.

48:48.762 --> 48:52.850
Poker. I've heard wonderful things
about that game. Can I watch?

48:53.016 --> 48:56.186
- You don't play poker?
- I'm pretty busy at the motor pool...

48:56.353 --> 49:01.441
...up to my elbows in grease. Maybe
I could join... Oh, no, there's a problem.

49:01.608 --> 49:03.694
I don't have any change.

49:03.861 --> 49:07.281
We can make change. It's OK.

49:08.031 --> 49:11.451
Oh, goody. I get to play cards.

49:11.618 --> 49:15.372
<i>... long way home just to think of an alibi</i>

49:15.539 --> 49:18.625
<i>Well, I couldn't think of a dozen things</i>

49:18.792 --> 49:19.877
<i>That hadn't already...</i>

49:20.043 --> 49:24.047
- Get you somethin'?
- Scotch, rocks. Good-looking woman.

49:24.214 --> 49:26.800
That's Bilko's girl.

49:26.967 --> 49:30.220
Now she looks even better.

49:31.722 --> 49:33.974
I'm dealing you five cards.

49:34.141 --> 49:36.643
- Five cards. Let me write this down.
- Yeah, OK.

49:36.810 --> 49:39.980
Now, the worst hand that you can have...

49:40.147 --> 49:43.901
...is if you only have one high card
and nothing else that matches.

49:44.067 --> 49:48.822
- But then comes a pair.
- A pair. How exciting. A pair.

49:49.823 --> 49:52.576
<i>(applause)</i>

49:52.743 --> 49:55.162
Only you

49:57.748 --> 50:01.251
Can make this world seem right

50:04.171 --> 50:07.341
Oh, thanks. Have you seen Ernie?

50:07.508 --> 50:09.760
- No, I haven't.
- Will you hold this a second?

50:09.927 --> 50:12.763
- Sure.
- Thanks.

50:14.848 --> 50:17.184
Excuse me. Have you guys seen Ernie?

50:17.351 --> 50:19.853
- No.
- No.

50:20.270 --> 50:22.523
Ernie?

50:22.856 --> 50:24.191
Ernie!

50:24.358 --> 50:27.528
I have three jacks and two sixes.
What's that called again?

50:27.694 --> 50:31.698
- A full house.
- What a cute name. A full house.

50:31.865 --> 50:35.953
- Is that good?
- Yes, that means you win.

50:36.370 --> 50:40.123
- Again.
- Oh, God, this is almost embarrassing.

50:40.290 --> 50:42.709
What is that? Five in a row?

50:42.876 --> 50:46.129
What a lovely watch.
Now, let's see. We'll just shuffle.

50:46.296 --> 50:49.132
Oops. Clumsy me.

50:49.633 --> 50:51.969
- OK. Cut? Thank you.
- Hey!

50:52.135 --> 50:55.138
Sorry. All right. OK.

50:59.560 --> 51:02.479
You are my destiny

51:03.313 --> 51:07.568
Oh. You hear that song?
It means I gotta go.

51:09.319 --> 51:13.740
Gee, I feel bad.
Can't I give some of this back?

51:14.324 --> 51:17.161
No, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?

51:17.327 --> 51:20.831
All right, well, I'll just
take these IOUs...

51:20.998 --> 51:25.836
...and the pink slip, and you can cash me
out and I'll see you back at the base.

51:26.003 --> 51:27.754
- Ernie!
- Good evening, sir.

51:27.921 --> 51:29.590
Excuse us, Major.

51:29.756 --> 51:34.845
Listen, I don't know why, but the colonel's
decided to climb all over your sorry butt.

51:35.012 --> 51:37.181
I'm afraid the party's over, Ernie.

51:37.347 --> 51:42.186
Get back to the post. I'd like to see your
men on the parade ground at 0500 hours.

51:42.352 --> 51:44.938
- Yes, sir. Weather permitting.
- What permitting?

51:45.105 --> 51:47.191
Who said that?

51:47.357 --> 51:50.277
It's payback time, Bilko.

51:50.444 --> 51:53.363
If it's all the same to you,
I'll tell my girlfriend we're leaving.

51:53.530 --> 51:59.786
<i>It's not all the same to me, Bilko.
Move it! Hut, hut, hut! Hut, hut, hut, hut!</i>

52:00.954 --> 52:03.874
You are my destiny

52:09.963 --> 52:12.299
This solves nothing.

52:12.466 --> 52:15.886
<i>This solves everything.</i>

52:16.803 --> 52:20.224
You haven't seen someone called
Ernie Bilko, have you?

52:20.390 --> 52:22.726
Oh, yes. He left a few minutes ago.

52:22.893 --> 52:26.980
- Are you sure?
- Yep, I definitely saw him go, in a hurry.

52:27.147 --> 52:31.652
You see, I happen to know
Major Ebersole offered him a poker game.

52:31.819 --> 52:35.072
You're my dream come true

52:36.240 --> 52:39.159
My one and only you

52:43.997 --> 52:46.250
I can drop you off
on my way back to the post.

52:46.416 --> 52:49.753
- This is very nice of you.
- Not at all.

52:49.920 --> 52:52.673
May I ask you...

52:53.340 --> 52:57.177
...could I call on you sometime?
- Oh, well, you see, I'm...

52:57.344 --> 52:59.680
I just broke up with someone.

52:59.847 --> 53:04.434
- He must be devastated.
- Oh... he doesn't know yet.

Good!

53:28.375 --> 53:33.881
All right, you've seen real soldiers before.
Just... do what they do.

53:37.801 --> 53:41.722
All right, let's do the
"grab the rifle by the bottom" thing!

53:41.889 --> 53:44.141
Arrgh!

53:44.474 --> 53:47.978
All right! Now, let's do the,
you know, the shoulder thing!

53:48.145 --> 53:52.483
Arrgh! The shoulder thing!
Ah! Arrgh! Arrgh! Yes.

53:52.649 --> 53:57.154
All right. And now the... the
"showing the rifle for the inspection" bit.

01:02:09.062 --> 01:02:11.315
And do what?

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:14.735
- Have fun. Unwind.
- Hm.

01:02:15.068 --> 01:02:17.237
- Well, shall I...?
- No, leave it on for a second.

01:02:17.404 --> 01:02:22.743
I'd just like to check on one or two things,
just out of curiosity.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.996
Well, good night.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.082
Good night.

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:32.753
I think it was very exciting,
the way you broke into that computer.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.672
- It was?
- Yes!

01:02:36.423 --> 01:02:40.928
<i>- (0ster) Can I buy you a drink?
- Why, yes.</i>

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:54.441
Oh, oh, oh! There they go!

01:03:01.365 --> 01:03:02.866
Oh, my. All right.

01:03:03.033 --> 01:03:08.121
Oh! Ouch! They're hot! They're hot.
Quick, quick, cool 'em off.

01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:11.625
Press the six and the eight
and the black ten.

01:03:11.792 --> 01:03:15.212
- All right, here we go. Now...
- Oh, he's shakin' 'em off.

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:20.801
Uh-oh, he's comin' with the pitch.
It looks like the high, hard one!

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.472
Ooh, baby! Oh, good.

01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:29.810
Gently. OK, and now, it's just a little...
It's easy, it's easy, it's easy.

01:03:29.977 --> 01:03:32.312
It's just... behind the back.

01:03:32.479 --> 01:03:35.732
Winner! We have a winner.

01:03:38.235 --> 01:03:42.156
Wait a minute. This chip is scratched.

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:44.074
- Mr Bilko.
- Yes?

01:03:44.241 --> 01:03:46.910
That's quite a run.
Is there anything we can do for you?

01:03:47.077 --> 01:03:52.666
Yes, go to your vault and tell your money
to be patient. We'll be together soon.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:55.669
<i>You mean he stood you up
before that night at the Rusty Spur?</i>

01:03:55.836 --> 01:03:58.755
Mm-hm. He left me standing at the altar.

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:00.924
There can be no excuse for that.

01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:05.929
You'd be surprised. He had a new excuse
every time. They were all pretty amazing.

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:09.266
- He did that more than once?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:09.433 --> 01:04:12.519
Rita, you have a lot of love to give.

01:04:12.686 --> 01:04:15.355
And you're smart.
Why put up with a clown like that?

01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:20.360
Because it was exciting. With Ernie,
every day was anything-can-happen day.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:22.863
Some couples play Scrabble.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.366
This isn't a game we're talking about -
it's your life.

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:29.953
Where I come from, when you tell
a woman you'll marry her, you mean it.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:35.375
You know something? I would never
stand you up. I'd never not call you.

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:40.297
But then, I'm an officer with career
prospects. I can handle responsibility.

01:04:40.464 --> 01:04:42.132
I guess you can.

01:04:42.299 --> 01:04:44.551
Wouldn't you like a man
who's there for you?

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:48.055
A man who wants to get married,
settle down and have a family.

01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:50.474
Yes.

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:54.478
I bought you this.

01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:58.732
A ring!

01:04:58.899 --> 01:05:01.902
Two carats of cubic zirconia.

01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:04.822
It's beautiful.

01:05:09.827 --> 01:05:11.161
Oh...

01:05:11.328 --> 01:05:14.832
This is happening... too fast.

01:05:15.249 --> 01:05:18.001
I don't want to hurt Ernie.

01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:19.670
No.

01:05:19.837 --> 01:05:23.590
We really don't want to hurt Ernie.

01:05:25.676 --> 01:05:28.095
- That's when Vegas was Vegas.
- Excuse me, Mr Bilko?

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:31.431
- He said it was an emergency.
- This must be the Pentagon.

01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:33.934
Hello? I can hardly hear you.

01:05:34.101 --> 01:05:37.855
Rita Robbins. She's been out
with that guy Thorn every night.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:40.274
<i>- Thorn?
- Since before you went on manoeuvres.</i>

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:44.611
Tomorrow night they're going out to
that fancy French restaurant in Roseville.

01:05:44.778 --> 01:05:50.617
She's lookin' pretty weak, Ernie,
I gotta tell ya. Like she would do anything.

01:05:51.869 --> 01:05:55.455
- Thanks, Sowicki.
- Bye, Ernie.

01:05:56.290 --> 01:05:58.876
<i>- Thank you, Stan.
- Hey, thank you!</i>

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:01.628
For allowing me
to screw with Bilko's head.

01:06:01.795 --> 01:06:03.797
Oh, it isn't a game this time, Stan.

01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:06.800
<i>I just need to find out
how much he really loves me.</i>

01:06:06.967 --> 01:06:09.469
- He loves you plenty.
- More than Las Vegas?

01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:12.556
That's asking a lot.

01:06:12.723 --> 01:06:15.058
<i>(rings)</i>

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:19.563
<i>(answer phone) Hi, this is Rita. I'm not in
right now. Please leave a message.</i>

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:23.400
Rita, it's me, Ernie. I'm on my way home.
I hear you're seeing Thorn...

01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:28.655
...and I just don't want you to take it too
seriously. He's only with you to annoy me.

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:33.160
I see. He couldn't possibly be interested
in me-that would be ridiculous.

01:06:33.327 --> 01:06:36.079
Rita, you're there.
This guy has terrible qualities.

01:06:36.246 --> 01:06:41.835
- For one thing, he's very manipulative.
- He seemed nice to me. Goodbye.

01:06:42.252 --> 01:06:44.922
Hello? Hello?

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:47.841
Rita? Rita?

01:06:52.763 --> 01:06:55.516
Why do you smell the cork?

01:06:55.682 --> 01:06:58.268
Your eyes are hazel, aren't they?

01:06:58.435 --> 01:06:59.436
Green.

01:06:59.603 --> 01:07:01.605
<i>(Bilko) I never have sex on the first date.</i>

01:07:01.772 --> 01:07:07.361
Thank God, it's our third. Oh, this is such
a... Oh, can't you just smell that... salad?

01:07:07.528 --> 01:07:10.531
Yes, I have a reservation.

01:07:10.697 --> 01:07:16.119
Ah, this must be the table. You know,
what they do very well here is the garlic.

01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:18.705
Oh, I touched you.
My temperature is rising.

01:07:18.872 --> 01:07:24.378
<i>Waiter, could we have two glasses
of red house, uh... s'il vous please?</i>

01:07:24.545 --> 01:07:26.713
In.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.049
Bilko. What a fool.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:30.634
Yeah.

01:07:30.801 --> 01:07:33.720
How can he afford to eat here
on a sergeant's pay?

01:07:33.887 --> 01:07:38.058
- I'll be a lieutenant colonel very soon.
- No kidding?

01:07:38.225 --> 01:07:40.644
<i>(exaggerated laugh)</i>

01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:43.897
- That woman's kind of attractive too.
- You think so?

01:07:44.064 --> 01:07:46.650
Well, not compared to you, of course.

01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:49.653
Anyway, I understand
the oysters here are...

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:53.407
...very, uh, very, uh... imported.

01:07:53.574 --> 01:07:56.493
- Just get me out of here fast.
- Relax, Paparelli.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.246
If you wanna make Rita jealous,
why not use Barbella?

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:05.169
She knows Barbella. I needed someone
she can't recognise. Someone alluring.

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:08.005
Thank you.

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:14.428
Ah! Well, it's Rita Robbins
and Major Thorn! Ah! A-ha-ha, aha.

01:08:15.762 --> 01:08:19.015
Um, excuse me. One moment.

01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:26.106
<i>- (Bilko clears throat)
- She's coming over? She's coming over?</i>

01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:30.777
Ernie, you made Paparelli
get into drag just to make me jealous?

01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:36.366
Well, actually, he was already in drag.
Paparelli, scram! Get going.

01:08:54.551 --> 01:08:56.886
Rita, you can't marry Thorn.
You don't love him.

01:08:57.054 --> 01:09:00.557
Think of the children.
You're a Catholic and he's an asshole!

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:06.145
How would you raise them? And he's
already cheating on you with Paparelli.

01:09:06.313 --> 01:09:09.149
Hi, soldier boy.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.737
<i>(hisses suggestively)</i>

01:09:15.906 --> 01:09:20.077
Sowicki never told you
I was marrying Thorn.

01:09:20.828 --> 01:09:25.165
You told Sowicki to call me.
You manipulated me. How could you?

01:09:25.332 --> 01:09:29.670
Why not? I have a master's in
manipulation from the University of Bilko.

01:09:29.837 --> 01:09:33.506
You tricked me. You sucked me in.

01:09:33.924 --> 01:09:37.426
This is the most turned on
I've ever been in my life.

01:09:37.594 --> 01:09:40.013
Rita, I'm so glad
we're back together again.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.015
Twelve more days.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.442
No wonder the hovertank never worked.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:57.698
Yes, sir. He's been diverting research
funds into his own private account.

01:09:57.865 --> 01:10:03.287
For all the differences I've had with Bilko
over the years, I've always liked him.

01:10:03.453 --> 01:10:05.706
The way he kept up the men's morale.

01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:09.960
The way he'd pretend to cry when I went
on leave. The way, on my birthday...

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:15.716
...he'd have the men mow my name in
the main lawn with a big heart around it.

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:19.386
- But now there'll be a court martial.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:19.553 --> 01:10:21.722
- Unless...
- Unless?

01:10:21.889 --> 01:10:25.726
It's just that I know we'd both
do anything to spare Bilko a court martial.

01:10:25.893 --> 01:10:28.395
If he could just be quietly punished.

01:10:28.562 --> 01:10:31.815
<i>(sighs) Yeah, sure.</i>

01:10:31.982 --> 01:10:34.151
But... but how?

01:10:34.318 --> 01:10:37.488
The CO has certain powers, sir.

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:42.242
- Powers?
- Can't he, for instance, have a soldier...

01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:46.830
...trans...

01:10:47.498 --> 01:10:50.417
Trans... atlantic?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.756
Trans... vestite?

01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:01.929
- Transferred!
- What a wonderful idea.

01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:05.516
Yes, well, the wheels are always spinning.

01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:11.730
It'd have to be somewhere where there'd
be no chance of him making trouble again.

01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:17.945
Greenland?

01:11:18.111 --> 01:11:22.282
He's been out walking
by himself for, like, four hours.

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:25.118
- What's he doin'?
- He's thinkin'.

01:11:25.285 --> 01:11:30.791
- I thought I heard him crying.
- He even asked for a box of tissues.

01:11:33.377 --> 01:11:35.045
<i>I guess you're happy.</i>

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:38.549
Yeah. He hated the sarge.
He was probably helping Thorn to get him.

01:11:38.715 --> 01:11:41.218
- I was not!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:44.388
This is Bilko we're
talkin' about here. Bilko!

01:11:44.555 --> 01:11:46.723
Nobody gets the best of Bilko. Come on!

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:49.560
<i>- That's right.
- (Paparelli) He'll think of somethin'.</i>

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:53.313
Remember when I got the letter from
my wife sayin' she wanted to break up?

01:11:53.438 --> 01:11:56.150
- Remember what Bilko did?
- He got your wife back?

01:11:56.316 --> 01:11:58.735
No, he got me another wife. A better wife!

01:11:58.902 --> 01:12:02.906
- Yeah!
- He'll come up with his best plan ever.

01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:07.411
Listen, I pity Major Thorn.
When Bilko gets done with him...

01:12:07.536 --> 01:12:10.164
<i>- (Doberman) Sarge!
- Ten-hut!</i>

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.166
Hey, Sarge!

01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:16.086
- Sarge!
- Sarge! You've come back!

01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:20.340
Ah, Doberman. The son I never wanted.

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:23.927
Fall in and look this way!

01:12:27.514 --> 01:12:30.350
Hello, soldiers.

01:12:30.476 --> 01:12:34.104
<i>I'm talking to you.
Because that's what you are really.</i>

01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:37.274
Soldiers, every last one of you -
with a couple of exceptions.

01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:39.318
- He's got a plan.
- He sure does.

01:12:39.443 --> 01:12:43.280
I wanna tell you a little story.
There was once a little boy...

01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:47.159
...and that little boy had a dream to run
one of the most sophisticated...

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:50.621
...illegal gaming operations
the US Army has ever seen.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:51.955
- He's not worried.
- Not a bit.

01:12:52.122 --> 01:12:54.416
And that little boy's dream came true.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:58.128
But now they're trying to
snatch that dream back from him.

01:12:58.295 --> 01:12:59.963
<i>- He is worried.
- That's not good.</i>

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:03.550
But what are the last two letters
in the name Bilko? K-O!

01:13:03.717 --> 01:13:06.428
Of course, the first are B-l-L,
which is meaningless.

01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:10.390
But still, am I giving up? No! Never!
Well, kind of, but not really...

01:13:10.557 --> 01:13:14.228
...because there is no way
I am going to Greenland.

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:17.064
Well, you're probably wondering
if I have a plan.

01:13:17.231 --> 01:13:21.527
Well, of course I have a plan!
A P-L-A-N. Plan.

01:13:25.489 --> 01:13:27.783
But...

01:13:28.325 --> 01:13:29.910
- He's got no plan.
- We're screwed.

01:13:30.077 --> 01:13:34.039
- I have a plan, Sarge.
- But maybe a plan is not what I need!

01:13:34.164 --> 01:13:37.417
What I really need is just a little puppy.

01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:41.880
A little puppy with big, brown eyes
who'll just come to me and lick my face...

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:46.510
...and just love me so much,
no matter what kind of person I am.

01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:47.761
<i>(Bilko sobs)</i>

01:13:47.928 --> 01:13:50.681
Sarge, I really do have a plan.

01:13:50.848 --> 01:13:55.477
<i>Oh, so now you have a plan.
Well, let's hear your plan, Wally.</i>

01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:59.565
What if the hovertank did work? That'd
prove you haven't diverted the money.

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:02.359
Oh! That is so stup... What?

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:07.865
That would prove you hadn't been
diverting the money. Wouldn't it?

01:14:09.616 --> 01:14:11.952
Are you saying you can get
the hovertank to work?

01:14:12.119 --> 01:14:18.333
<i>No, of course not. But we don't need to
hold four aces if they think we hold'em.</i>

01:14:20.419 --> 01:14:23.380
Permission to speak freely?

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:26.967
Tell me a bit more about this plan,
because I think that's actually...

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:29.887
If they come, deny everything.
Just act dumb.

01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:34.141
Fender, I'm putting you in charge of that.

01:14:35.893 --> 01:14:39.480
I love the nightlife, I like to boogie

01:14:39.688 --> 01:14:41.732
I like to rock all night long

01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:43.984
<i>(Bilko) Ahem.</i>

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.904
Oh... it's you, Bilko.

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:49.490
Sir, if I could talk with you
just for a moment.

01:14:49.656 --> 01:14:53.160
If you've come to talk about Greenland,
you're wasting your time.

01:14:53.327 --> 01:14:55.579
Frankly, Sergeant, I'm disappointed.

01:14:55.746 --> 01:14:59.333
Sir, all I ever wanted was an honest
week's pay for an honest day's work.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.337
- I didn't steal money, sir.
- Please, Bilko.

01:15:03.504 --> 01:15:05.923
Let's just say goodbye.

01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:08.091
And thank you.

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:11.428
- For what, sir?
- Well, for...

01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:14.848
...always making me feel like
I actually ran this place.

01:15:15.015 --> 01:15:17.601
Good old Fort Baxter.

01:15:17.768 --> 01:15:20.437
I guess your garden
is one of the things you'll miss most.

01:15:20.604 --> 01:15:22.356
Ah, yes. I love...

01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:25.025
<i>- Miss? Why miss?
- The colonel hasn't heard?</i>

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:29.029
- In that case, it must not be true.
- What? Uh... they're closing Fort Baxter?

01:15:29.238 --> 01:15:31.448
You didn't hear it from me.

01:15:31.615 --> 01:15:34.701
Take good care of yourself in...
I've said enough.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:37.037
Have you heard where they're sending me?

01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:40.541
- You're stepping on your flowers.
- The hell with them! Where?

01:15:40.749 --> 01:15:43.544
- Where are they sending me?
- It's just rumour, sir.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:47.548
Oh, that fair skin
under the burning desert sun...

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:51.301
<i>Oh, my God. The desert sun.</i>

01:15:51.635 --> 01:15:54.555
Remember, if you get lost, travel by night.

01:15:54.763 --> 01:15:59.226
- How can they do this to me?
- The hovertank test was the last straw.

01:15:59.393 --> 01:16:01.979
Too bad they didn't schedule it this week.

01:16:02.146 --> 01:16:04.398
Well...

01:16:04.565 --> 01:16:06.650
- Goodbye.
- Wha...? Wait!

01:16:06.817 --> 01:16:10.571
- You mean the hovertank is working?
- Oh, I know what you're thinking, sir:

01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:13.157
..."Arrange a public demonstration ASAP."

01:16:13.323 --> 01:16:15.826
"Call the Pentagon
and the Department of the Army."

01:16:15.993 --> 01:16:18.787
- All right.
- I've already taken that liberty, sir.

01:16:18.912 --> 01:16:20.873
- Thank you.
- Oh, that picture of you...

01:16:20.998 --> 01:16:23.542
...standing triumphant at the test.

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:28.422
That'll keep me warm
on those lonely nights in Greenland.

01:16:28.589 --> 01:16:31.008
<i>In Greenland, sir.</i>

01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:33.177
Oh. Yes.

01:16:33.385 --> 01:16:36.054
Well, goodbye.

01:16:37.055 --> 01:16:40.225
- Ah, Bi...
- Yes, sir?

01:16:41.351 --> 01:16:44.605
If the test goes well,
you won't be transferred.

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:47.858
Well, thank you, sir! I'm stunned!

01:16:47.983 --> 01:16:50.277
Just as a formality,
I've put that in writing.

01:16:50.444 --> 01:16:55.199
If you could just sign here
and here, and initial here.

01:16:57.534 --> 01:17:00.204
- Here?
- Uh, no. Here.

01:17:00.370 --> 01:17:03.040
And I'll just notarise that.

01:17:03.165 --> 01:17:08.128
- And I'll waive the usual ten-dollar fee.
- Oh. Thank you.

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:11.507
Here you are. Good day.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.468
No, it'll hover. But as before...

01:17:14.635 --> 01:17:18.889
...it will go completely haywire
if we attempt to fire the cannon.

01:17:19.056 --> 01:17:21.475
We know that. We just need
a couple of hours with it.

01:17:21.642 --> 01:17:25.646
- Let's get started.
- It's a $70-million piece of equipment.

01:17:25.813 --> 01:17:29.066
You think I'm gonna allow
one of your men to fool around with it?

01:17:29.191 --> 01:17:31.652
- I think not.
- Oh. Mm-hm.

01:17:31.777 --> 01:17:35.739
Oh, boy. Oh, my, is it hot in here or what?

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:38.909
What's this? Oh!
I almost forgot I had these.

01:17:39.076 --> 01:17:41.578
It's the IOUs from the poker game.

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:46.500
- Would he like to use my tools?
- That would be nice.

01:17:49.837 --> 01:17:53.423
- You saw it?
- Yeah, it blew up the ammunition shed.

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:56.760
<i>- A perfect hit.
- (louder) The hovertank?</i>

01:17:56.927 --> 01:17:59.680
- I thought that thing was busted.
- Yeah, it was.

01:17:59.888 --> 01:18:01.682
But the kid, Wally, he fixed it.

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:04.685
He said the key was the...

01:18:04.852 --> 01:18:07.229
The...?

01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:11.275
The fire-control
and super-elevator board.

01:18:11.441 --> 01:18:15.362
- Imagine that.
- Yeah, the super-elevator board.

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:20.617
And the great thing is, if it works
at the demonstration, Bilko gets to stay.

01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:23.036
Great!

01:18:50.981 --> 01:18:53.233
Yeah.

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:19.009
- Wonderful to see you again, General.
- You, too, Colonel. Mrs Hall.

01:19:19.176 --> 01:19:23.597
- And, of course, you know Major Thorn.
- Thorn.

01:19:34.942 --> 01:19:37.694
<i>(deep sigh)</i>

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:48.038
- Tank crew ready, sir.
- Very good, Bilko. General.

01:19:48.205 --> 01:19:50.624
Master Sergeant Bilko.
It's an honour to meet you.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:54.461
- You look terrific! Have you lost weight?
- Who is this?

01:19:54.628 --> 01:19:59.216
Members of Congress, General Tennyson,
colleagues from the defence industries...

01:19:59.383 --> 01:20:03.053
...distinguished guests, welcome.

01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:05.806
The weapon system
you are about to see today...

01:20:05.973 --> 01:20:11.562
...can be called the world's first
truly all-terrain assault vehicle...

01:20:11.979 --> 01:20:17.526
...which I'm proud to say was developed
entirely in-house, here at Fort Baxter.

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:22.156
I give you the armoured attack platform
to lead American defence forces...

01:20:22.322 --> 01:20:26.660
...into the 21st century.
The HTX-1 hovertank.

01:20:38.088 --> 01:20:42.259
Water and rough terrain can stop
an ordinary M1 or APC...

01:20:42.426 --> 01:20:45.846
...but the hovertank can literally rise
above these obstacles.

01:20:46.013 --> 01:20:49.892
And that is the capability
we will show you here today.

01:20:50.017 --> 01:20:53.604
Hovertank, you are looking good.

01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:58.025
Hovertank, fire when ready. Hoo-ah!

01:20:58.442 --> 01:21:01.111
<i>(groans)</i>

01:21:14.041 --> 01:21:16.793
<i>(applause)</i>

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:29.223
Ha. This little bird packs a deadly punch.

01:21:59.086 --> 01:22:01.922
Fire in the hole!

01:22:35.289 --> 01:22:41.211
- You hit the wrong button, Rastahead!
- It's not my fault! He wired it wrong!

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.591
Any questions?

01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:09.907
Congratulations, honey.

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:11.992
- Home run, sir!
- Thank you, Captain.

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:14.912
- We'll rush this baby into production.
- Thank you.

01:23:15.078 --> 01:23:18.749
Jack, I thank you
on behalf of a grateful nation.

01:23:18.957 --> 01:23:23.420
I just can't wait to see
what you fellas come up with next.

01:23:23.587 --> 01:23:26.507
Wait! Wait. The demonstration was rigged.

01:23:26.673 --> 01:23:30.469
Ah, do I see politics in your future, sir?
Perhaps a run at the Oval Office?

01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:32.846
I've never given that serious consideration.

01:23:33.055 --> 01:23:35.015
Wait! General! He faked it!

01:23:35.182 --> 01:23:38.685
Didn't you see the gun was aimed
at target three, but blew up target four?

01:23:38.811 --> 01:23:40.187
Yes, I did.

01:23:40.395 --> 01:23:43.190
If you remember
Einstein's theory, space is curved.

01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:47.194
- Yes.
- And these are smart weapons.

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:50.823
Oh, cut the crap! He faked it.
It's just one of his scams.

01:23:51.031 --> 01:23:54.117
That's a serious charge.
Colonel, what about this?

01:23:54.284 --> 01:23:56.370
General, in all my years in the service...

01:23:56.537 --> 01:23:59.790
...I have never, not once,
publicly berated a fellow officer.

01:23:59.957 --> 01:24:03.836
But I realise now that from the moment
Major Thorn set foot on Fort Baxter...

01:24:03.961 --> 01:24:07.631
...he engaged in a personal vendetta
against Master Sergeant Bilko.

01:24:07.798 --> 01:24:11.969
I find his conduct inexcusable, and will
recommend an article 32 investigation.

01:24:12.177 --> 01:24:13.887
<i>- I see.
- (Thorn) You don't understand.</i>

01:24:14.054 --> 01:24:18.433
He doesn't know what's going on. This
sergeant leads him around by the nose!

01:24:18.642 --> 01:24:23.647
Major! You are the most
insubordinate officer I have ever met.

01:24:23.814 --> 01:24:27.985
I'm telling you, he's a boob! He doesn't
get it! They faked the whole thing!

01:24:28.152 --> 01:24:32.906
I'd like to see just one piece of evidence
to support these idiotic allegations.

01:24:33.031 --> 01:24:38.328
Idiotic, huh? How's this for evidence? The
fire-control and super-elevator board.

01:24:38.495 --> 01:24:42.749
I took it out last night,
so how can it work?

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:52.759
So you deliberately
sabotaged this project, Major?

01:24:52.885 --> 01:24:55.471
I got it all on tape.

01:24:55.679 --> 01:24:57.931
Lucky.

01:24:58.599 --> 01:25:01.518
<i>(wind howling)</i>

01:25:03.437 --> 01:25:05.689
- Whoo!
- Yeah, celebration time.

01:25:05.856 --> 01:25:08.358
Chin-chin.

01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:13.697
Because I know Pap knew it,
and I... Stand, troops!

01:25:15.365 --> 01:25:19.203
<i>- You're in the presence of a genius.
- (all) Hoo-ah!</i>

01:25:19.411 --> 01:25:24.374
You're a total kingpin. You got Thorn
to sabotage something that didn't work!

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:29.213
Yeah, well, I couldn't have done it without
our Wally. Where is he, where is the lad?

01:25:29.338 --> 01:25:31.965
Here, Sarge.

01:25:32.633 --> 01:25:36.804
I was just resetting
the colonel's odometer.

01:25:44.228 --> 01:25:48.690
- I told you Wally was all right.
- OK. Glee club.

01:26:02.412 --> 01:26:03.747
Oh, well.

01:26:03.914 --> 01:26:07.376
Only you, only you, only you

01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:12.923
Can make this change in me

01:26:15.217 --> 01:26:17.678
Only you

01:26:20.347 --> 01:26:23.267
You are my destiny

01:26:23.851 --> 01:26:26.145
Destiny

01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:30.274
When you hold my hand,
I understand the

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.696
Magic that you do,
magic that you do

01:26:38.699 --> 01:26:42.202
Ooh, you're my dream come true

01:26:44.288 --> 01:26:47.040
My one and only

01:26:48.876 --> 01:26:49.710
You

01:26:49.877 --> 01:26:52.963
Hum

01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:55.799
It's only you

01:26:58.135 --> 01:27:00.053
Very nice.

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:02.806
Aw, get up, Bilko.

01:27:02.973 --> 01:27:08.812
Marry me, Rita. I know I'm a long shot,
but sometimes long shots pay off big.

01:27:12.316 --> 01:27:15.319
<i>(soldiers cheer)</i>

01:27:18.322 --> 01:27:22.910
<i>(organ plays
"0nward, Christian Soldiers")</i>

01:27:36.423 --> 01:27:39.259
<i>(music ends)</i>

<i>(organ resumes)</i>

01:28:01.281 --> 01:28:06.286
Don't even ask. I forgot it was
daylight-savings time. Can you believe it?

01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:09.915
Well, better late than never.

01:28:15.295 --> 01:28:17.548
- Poker?
- All right.

01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:20.342
Nickel ante.

01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:25.055
Let's make it interesting.
One hand of showdown.

01:28:25.222 --> 01:28:28.475
If I win, we get married.

01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:33.397
Ernie, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:38.902
I've never known you to chicken out
of a game, whatever the stakes.

01:28:44.158 --> 01:28:47.452
<i>(whispers) You're on.</i>

01:28:48.036 --> 01:28:50.247
Well, well, well, what do you know?

01:28:50.414 --> 01:28:53.167
- Full house. Jacks over threes.
- You cheated!

01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:55.169
- No, and we're getting married!
- When?

01:28:55.294 --> 01:28:58.589
<i>Now! (blows whistle)</i>

01:29:04.928 --> 01:29:07.097
Daddy!

01:29:07.264 --> 01:29:09.683
- Ow!
- Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...

01:29:09.892 --> 01:29:11.977
...to witness the joining of these
two good people in holy matrimony.

01:29:12.186 --> 01:29:15.355
Rita Robbins, do you take Ernest Bilko
to love, honour and cherish...

01:29:15.564 --> 01:29:18.442
...for richer or poorer...
- Think we're moving too fast?

01:29:18.609 --> 01:29:19.860
- I do.
- Let's go!

01:29:20.027 --> 01:29:23.780
- Do you, Ernest Bilko, take Rita...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I do.

01:29:23.947 --> 01:29:29.661
By the power vested in me, I pronounce
you husband and wife. You may ki...

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:32.831
Ah.
