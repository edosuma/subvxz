(alarm ringing)

00:27.133 --> 00:28.849
(alarm stops)

00:38.394 --> 00:40.194
Lottie.

00:42.348 --> 00:43.565
Lottie.

00:43.566 --> 00:46.166
(water running)

00:50.273 --> 00:52.941
Lucy's voice: <i>"Dearest John,</i>

00:52.942 --> 00:56.411
<i>I don't even know if you're
getting these letters.</i>

00:56.412 --> 01:00.893
<i>I hope so.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:04.087
<i>I hate to think of you
in that place alone.</i>

01:04.577 --> 01:06.693
<i>I wish they'd let me visit.</i>

01:09.250 --> 01:11.154
<i>Life just goes on.</i>

01:11.629 --> 01:13.413
<i>But not for me.</i>

01:14.288 --> 01:16.420
<i>Not without you.</i>

01:17.267 --> 01:18.791
<i>The days are so long.</i>

01:24.067 --> 01:26.265
<i>I haven't seen Sister Harriet, yet.</i>

01:26.266 --> 01:29.027
<i>But Mr. Cleary says she
seems to be baring up.</i>

01:29.430 --> 01:31.597
<i>I don't know when the trial is.</i>

01:32.266 --> 01:34.944
<i>The ground breaking for the
new hospital is next week.</i>

01:34.991 --> 01:37.960
<i>So Mr. Barrow has been walking
around like a peacock.</i>

01:42.547 --> 01:46.714
<i>I assisted in a Previa surgery the other
day, with Bertie and Dr. Edwards.</i>

01:47.235 --> 01:49.247
<i>It's hard with Bertie.</i>

01:49.248 --> 01:50.785
<i>He's still mad.</i>

01:51.730 --> 01:53.665
<i>They lifted Dr. Gallinger's suspension</i>

01:53.666 --> 01:57.576
<i>but he still hasn't returned to work.</i>

02:03.659 --> 02:05.966
<i>That's all I have for now.</i>

02:06.623 --> 02:08.568
<i>Please write if you can.</i>

02:09.618 --> 02:11.662
<i>I miss you terribly and want so much</i>

02:11.663 --> 02:12.868
<i>to know how you are.</i>

02:14.942 --> 02:17.382
<i>I wish I could see you my love.</i>

02:19.638 --> 02:22.635
<i>Yours, Lucy.</i>

03:18.248 --> 03:20.231
(sighs)

04:12.713 --> 04:15.119
If you want I could...

04:15.592 --> 04:19.334
tattoo her lips to make
them appear more plump.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.170
I'll only you charge you 4 bottles.

04:22.364 --> 04:23.924
No, thank you.

04:24.489 --> 04:25.615
Two?

04:39.631 --> 04:41.617
- Mrs. Showalter.
- There you are.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.582
- Any luck with the Mayor's office?
- No.

04:44.717 --> 04:47.563
They're more afraid of the news
spreading than the disease.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.852
Any more cases?

04:50.301 --> 04:53.569
Not in the last 5 days. Those
first cases were the only ones.

04:53.570 --> 04:56.126
- Is any food getting in at all?
- Nothing.

04:56.127 --> 04:57.644
They won't let anything in.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.825
I'll try and get the Health Department
to speak to the police Chief.

05:00.826 --> 05:02.500
Miss, I told you not to get close.

05:02.699 --> 05:04.278
There's sickness in there.

05:04.363 --> 05:07.257
Plague is carried by rodents and fleas.

05:07.422 --> 05:10.188
You think your wooden barriers
are keeping them inside?

05:10.528 --> 05:13.425
Dr. Feng just said there are no new cases.

05:13.426 --> 05:15.446
<i>There's no need for the quarantine.</i>

05:15.447 --> 05:18.350
Mayor Phelan says them coolies
got it and I trust the mayor.

05:41.854 --> 05:43.580
Mother Superior.

05:44.604 --> 05:46.322
My child.

05:47.278 --> 05:50.658
Did you come all the way
from Ohio to see me?

05:50.807 --> 05:52.133
I wanted to.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.945
I brought something.

06:00.067 --> 06:03.936
It's what you gave me your
third year at the convent

06:03.937 --> 06:08.039
on the date of our
Virgin Mother's birth.

06:09.193 --> 06:11.778
The day that you committed
yourself to God.

06:11.779 --> 06:15.498
And I always carry it
with me when I travel.

06:15.499 --> 06:19.619
I was so proud of you,
how far you'd come

06:19.620 --> 06:21.754
since that little Irish girl

06:21.755 --> 06:24.757
abandoned by her mother
on the train west.

06:24.758 --> 06:26.709
You saved my life.

06:26.710 --> 06:28.878
You brightened ours.

06:28.879 --> 06:31.514
Brave, tenacious, spirited.

06:31.515 --> 06:34.934
A heart as big as the moon.

06:34.935 --> 06:37.652
Lost and then found.

06:40.974 --> 06:42.958
Is it true?

06:46.563 --> 06:51.284
I could say that God sent an
angel down to instruct me

06:51.285 --> 06:54.419
or there was something
divine about it...

06:55.823 --> 06:57.957
<i>but there wasn't.</i>

06:57.958 --> 07:00.827
<i>The women just needed help</i>

07:00.828 --> 07:03.094
<i>and I helped them.</i>

07:04.465 --> 07:06.799
So it's true.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.067
I am what they say I am.

07:14.091 --> 07:17.075
Then what you are is a devil on Earth.

07:18.762 --> 07:21.413
A murderer of innocents.

07:23.817 --> 07:26.152
You have disgraced me,

07:26.153 --> 07:28.488
the sisters who loved you,

07:28.489 --> 07:30.573
the convent that saved you,

07:30.574 --> 07:32.158
the nurses who taught you,

07:32.159 --> 07:34.110
the Catholics who nurtured you,

07:34.111 --> 07:36.928
and the God who loved you.

07:42.870 --> 07:46.054
This is all that's left
of you in my heart.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.940
<i>(book thuds)</i>

07:50.260 --> 07:52.611
I should have let you die.

08:01.555 --> 08:02.988
Hmm.

08:04.391 --> 08:09.244
There are some straw-colored
striae that are visible.

08:11.354 --> 08:13.321
How is the peripheral vision?

08:14.785 --> 08:17.370
Some issues.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.088
<i>Put this over your right eye.</i>

08:24.995 --> 08:27.997
And how do these appear to you?

08:27.998 --> 08:30.265
<i>Wavy on the left.</i>

08:31.251 --> 08:33.635
<i>And a bit better on the right.</i>

08:33.636 --> 08:37.423
Have you had any blows
to that eye recently?

08:37.424 --> 08:38.724
<i>Yes.</i>

08:38.725 --> 08:41.894
Well, those blows detached your retina.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.730
Seems to have almost
completely separated

08:44.731 --> 08:46.599
from the rear wall of your left eye.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.484
And the treatment?

08:48.485 --> 08:50.686
Not much to recommend.

08:50.687 --> 08:53.489
Rest in a recumbent
position for several weeks

08:53.490 --> 08:55.024
may bring some relief.

08:55.025 --> 08:57.743
So it could heal on its own?

08:57.744 --> 09:00.830
Or get worse. There's no way of knowing.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.951
And any further blows
could prove catastrophic.

09:04.952 --> 09:08.037
Are there any other procedures?

09:08.038 --> 09:09.971
Experimental?

09:11.375 --> 09:15.277
They're all unproven and much too risky.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.973
What about this one, Everett?

09:26.974 --> 09:30.026
Looks to be about the
right shape and color.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.660
Dorothy?

09:36.233 --> 09:38.784
<i>You have a wonderful eye, love.</i>

09:38.785 --> 09:40.570
Dentist: <i>You're certainly
lucky to have a sister</i>

09:40.571 --> 09:43.739
<i>with such a wonderful
set of teeth herself.</i>

09:43.740 --> 09:46.242
<i>How long are you visiting
from Philadelphia?</i>

09:46.243 --> 09:48.578
As long as she needs me.

09:48.579 --> 09:50.580
Dorothy has been a godsend

09:50.581 --> 09:55.317
ever since I pulled Eleanor out of Dr.
Cotton's abysmal madhouse.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.638
I often get a new batch
of teeth from the morgue

09:58.639 --> 10:01.307
on Thursdays if you'd
like me to return then.

10:01.308 --> 10:04.025
No, I want to finish now.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.269
Cleary: <i>She'll do 14 miles an hour</i>

10:13.270 --> 10:17.156
and never need a drink of
water or a bucket of oats.

10:17.157 --> 10:20.109
Just plug her in and she'll do the miles.

10:20.110 --> 10:23.162
I can drive her good, too. The man
who sold her to me taught me how.

10:23.163 --> 10:26.032
And you say you own it? Legally?

10:26.033 --> 10:29.085
Got a bill of sale and everything.

10:29.086 --> 10:32.421
And you want me to pay you to drive this?

10:32.422 --> 10:34.757
You put Knickerbocker
up there on the side,

10:34.758 --> 10:37.426
people will be making themselves
sick to take a ride in her.

10:37.427 --> 10:39.295
She'll go perfect with the place uptown.

10:39.296 --> 10:42.715
Show everyone that we're modern and all.

10:42.716 --> 10:44.884
And what if it runs out of electricity?

10:44.885 --> 10:47.887
There's places all over that'll swap
the battery off the bottom in a jiff.

10:47.888 --> 10:50.439
Bolt on a full one and I'm on my way.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.477
No more hooves to the head.
No more tacking up.

10:54.478 --> 10:56.445
No more horse shit.

10:56.446 --> 10:59.164
(chuckles) I doubt that.

11:05.238 --> 11:09.041
I'll give you $45 a month
to cover the automobile,

11:09.042 --> 11:11.627
10 of which comes back to me

11:11.628 --> 11:14.797
and you pay for all repairs
to keep it running.

11:14.798 --> 11:17.967
Mr. Barrow, you just got
yourself the finest ambulance

11:17.968 --> 11:20.836
- in all of New York City.
- (laughs)

11:20.837 --> 11:22.805
Come on.

11:22.806 --> 11:25.440
We are in business.

11:39.356 --> 11:41.273
It's a little dark.
I'm having trouble seeing.

11:41.274 --> 11:43.341
Nurse Baker, light, please.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.831
Retract more, nurse.

11:48.832 --> 11:51.283
What do you notice?

11:51.284 --> 11:53.786
Calot's triangle.

11:53.787 --> 11:56.038
There are two cystic arteries arising

11:56.039 --> 11:58.257
from the hepatic instead
of the usual one.

11:58.258 --> 12:01.643
It occurs in about 15% of cases.

12:04.214 --> 12:06.382
Nurse Baker, has our next
patient been prepped?

12:06.383 --> 12:08.851
- He has.
- And the one after that? The tonsils?

12:08.852 --> 12:11.286
- I'll make certain.
- Thank you.

12:12.973 --> 12:16.541
We'll need to separate out
and ligate both arteries.

12:18.111 --> 12:22.898
The inferior one is
exceptionally underdeveloped.

12:22.899 --> 12:24.749
It's hard against the hepatic.

12:26.903 --> 12:28.954
You do it.

12:28.955 --> 12:30.706
Me?

12:30.707 --> 12:32.041
You've seen it done.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.425
Now it's time you do one yourself.

12:35.912 --> 12:37.963
See one, do one?

12:37.964 --> 12:39.647
Teach one.

12:43.754 --> 12:45.904
(humming)

12:50.894 --> 12:52.762
Dr. Gallinger.

12:52.763 --> 12:54.696
Edwards.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.321
Tell me, how...

13:02.322 --> 13:04.956
how are things at home?

13:06.359 --> 13:09.328
(sighs)

13:09.329 --> 13:12.430
I am ready to resume my duties.

13:16.119 --> 13:17.753
I see.

13:17.754 --> 13:22.341
Well, I must admit that having a
third set of experienced hands

13:22.342 --> 13:24.760
would be useful in picking up the slack,

13:24.761 --> 13:26.277
but know this...

13:28.515 --> 13:30.132
<i>you come back,</i>

13:30.133 --> 13:33.803
you come back as subordinate to me

13:33.804 --> 13:37.523
<i>with the full respect and
deference that implies.</i>

13:37.524 --> 13:41.393
I think I'll come back when
the chief of surgery returns.

13:41.394 --> 13:43.779
<i>I'm acting chief now.</i>

13:43.780 --> 13:45.815
<i>And I intend to make that permanent.</i>

13:45.816 --> 13:49.834
<i>You think this hospital
will go along with that?</i>

13:52.656 --> 13:55.640
You're as dumb as you
think I think you are.

14:10.974 --> 14:12.725
(knocks)

14:12.726 --> 14:14.609
Bertie: <i>Come in.</i>

14:19.316 --> 14:21.199
Nurse Elkins.

14:23.019 --> 14:26.021
I miss you calling me Lucy.

14:26.022 --> 14:29.024
It's your title in this institution.

14:29.025 --> 14:30.609
I think a woman such as yourself

14:30.610 --> 14:34.095
would be glad to receive any
sign of respect at this point.

14:38.869 --> 14:41.787
You don't have to be mean.

14:41.788 --> 14:44.389
It's not in your nature.

14:47.711 --> 14:49.477
What do you want?

14:50.881 --> 14:53.147
<i>It's just that it's
your birthday tomorrow.</i>

14:54.384 --> 14:57.035
I always like to get my presents early.

14:58.138 --> 14:59.355
Makes your special day feel longer

14:59.356 --> 15:01.456
'cause it starts the day before.

15:07.314 --> 15:09.831
Aren't you gonna open it?

15:20.160 --> 15:22.176
<i>It's a caduceus.</i>

15:24.297 --> 15:26.230
<i>It's real gold.</i>

15:28.468 --> 15:30.852
Must have cost you a lot.

15:32.088 --> 15:34.355
I wanted to.

15:40.597 --> 15:42.030
I can't accept this.

15:43.483 --> 15:46.936
Barrow: Well, I've been doing
my best on several fronts.

15:46.937 --> 15:50.906
Our groundbreaking ceremony
is still on schedule

15:50.907 --> 15:53.859
and will certainly attract
donors' attention.

15:53.860 --> 15:56.779
You've all approved
the architectural plans

15:56.780 --> 16:01.116
and I've set about hiring the
best contractors in New York.

16:01.117 --> 16:04.787
Each is going through
a withering negotiation,

16:04.788 --> 16:06.672
I can assure you.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.173
Not a penny of your money

16:08.174 --> 16:10.960
will be wasted on manpower or materials.

16:10.961 --> 16:14.597
Very good. What's next?

16:14.598 --> 16:19.518
Dr. Edwards is waiting to give
us a report on his efforts.

16:19.519 --> 16:21.152
Bring him in.

16:28.228 --> 16:30.461
Dr. Edwards.

16:37.988 --> 16:40.338
Good day, gentlemen.

16:41.374 --> 16:43.208
Algie.

16:43.209 --> 16:45.176
Have a seat.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.179
(clears throat)

16:54.804 --> 16:58.173
Despite being understaffed,

16:58.174 --> 17:00.976
the surgical service
has been able to average

17:00.977 --> 17:03.262
over 40 surgeries per week

17:03.263 --> 17:05.263
with no increase in complications

17:05.265 --> 17:08.165
and an 18% decrease in mortality.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.488
Also...

17:12.489 --> 17:16.790
we have added several new procedures.

17:18.028 --> 17:22.748
Four of which we have
perfected ourselves.

17:22.749 --> 17:25.534
When will Dr. Thackery return?

17:25.535 --> 17:27.453
The news I've received indicates the man

17:27.454 --> 17:30.372
is in no shape to return
and likely never will be.

17:30.373 --> 17:33.024
He seems lost to his addiction forever.

17:34.544 --> 17:38.479
If that ends up being the case...

17:42.802 --> 17:45.020
I would like to put myself forward

17:45.021 --> 17:49.058
as a candidate for the permanent
job as chief of surgery.

17:49.059 --> 17:51.060
I'm sure you would.

17:51.061 --> 17:53.896
At the very least, I think
it would be prudent

17:53.897 --> 17:55.614
to start a search.

17:55.615 --> 17:58.400
For a fourth surgeon, yes.

17:58.401 --> 18:02.871
No, for a man to take your
job atop the department.

18:02.872 --> 18:06.041
There are the right sort of
men at several institutions

18:06.042 --> 18:08.877
around the country who would
make excellent candidates.

18:08.878 --> 18:10.796
I know a very good
junior man at Dartmouth

18:10.797 --> 18:12.581
who would be eager to make a step up.

18:12.582 --> 18:17.920
Henry: <i>Before we go casting about
New Hampshire for new blood,</i>

18:17.921 --> 18:20.839
<i>let's put together a set of criteria,</i>

18:20.840 --> 18:23.842
most of which I'm sure
Dr. Edwards already fulfills,

18:23.843 --> 18:26.812
and begin a more formal process.

18:26.813 --> 18:28.430
Agreed.

18:28.431 --> 18:30.682
I may have a solution to the problem

18:30.683 --> 18:34.269
of the fourth surgeon you requested.

18:34.270 --> 18:38.273
I was recently able
to lure Dr. William Mays

18:38.274 --> 18:42.194
out of private practice
and to our hospital.

18:42.195 --> 18:46.281
In addition to being an excellent doctor,

18:46.282 --> 18:48.784
he was also trained as a surgeon.

18:48.785 --> 18:51.920
You hired a surgeon
without consulting me?

18:51.921 --> 18:55.124
I hired a doctor, which is my job.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.960
I know Mays. A good
family and a decent sort.

18:57.961 --> 19:00.929
Monsignor: <i> His wife's a member of
the Women's Temperance Society.</i>

19:00.930 --> 19:02.881
An irony if there ever was one.

19:02.882 --> 19:05.399
- (men laugh)
- Gentlemen.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.888
If I may be candid.

19:09.889 --> 19:12.391
Dr. Mays is a general practitioner

19:12.392 --> 19:15.277
and not up to the surgical
standards of this hospital.

19:15.278 --> 19:18.230
He is connected to the
wealthiest people in New York.

19:18.231 --> 19:20.783
I know you're hot about
the meeting, Algie,

19:20.784 --> 19:24.069
and I don't blame you.

19:24.070 --> 19:26.655
Waiting in the hall

19:26.656 --> 19:29.173
like a child outside of
the principal's office.

19:30.493 --> 19:32.795
And then for Barrow
to go behind my back.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.830
Do you think he ever would
have done that to Thackery?

19:34.831 --> 19:37.765
You're not Thackery,
for better or for worse.

19:40.970 --> 19:44.139
You see Habershorn's face when you said
you wanted to be made permanent chief?

19:44.140 --> 19:46.975
(scoffs) If I hadn't known better,
I would have prescribed him

19:46.976 --> 19:48.844
something for impacted constipation.

19:48.845 --> 19:50.778
(laughs)

19:57.179 --> 19:57.990
Look.

19:57.991 --> 20:00.406
I know you are absolutely qualified

20:00.407 --> 20:02.040
to be chief of surgery.

20:02.706 --> 20:06.406
But, you of all people know
that we have to move carefully.

20:06.557 --> 20:09.599
The other board members have
neither the progressive

20:09.600 --> 20:11.234
mind nor the courage to...

20:11.711 --> 20:14.744
make the sort of change
that you and I want.

20:15.402 --> 20:17.687
The world may not be
moving fast enough for us

20:17.688 --> 20:19.974
but its likely moving
much to quickly for them.

20:20.561 --> 20:23.121
These are not the kind of men
who like to make history.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.347
They'd rather tout there
ancestors place in it.

20:26.883 --> 20:29.794
You might remind them of
your ancestors place in it.

20:31.918 --> 20:33.886
We'll get you what you want.

20:33.971 --> 20:37.537
We're just going to need to
bring them along slowly.

20:40.857 --> 20:42.568
Then I trust you to do that.

20:57.398 --> 21:00.152
Phillip, you're home so early.

21:00.239 --> 21:01.975
I didn't expect you until six.

21:01.976 --> 21:04.377
Well, I told you this morning
I'd be back for lunch.

21:04.378 --> 21:05.568
We have the opera tonight.

21:05.608 --> 21:06.316
Of course.

21:06.317 --> 21:09.591
But I thought we could spend some
time together this afternoon.

21:10.289 --> 21:11.722
Where are you going?

21:11.762 --> 21:13.462
I need to run an errand.

21:13.599 --> 21:15.579
- Can't it wait?
- No, it can't.

21:16.871 --> 21:18.336
What are you up to?

21:18.427 --> 21:20.014
- Nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

21:21.038 --> 21:23.473
I'm helping a sick friend, that's all.

21:23.919 --> 21:26.322
I'll be back before the curtain.

21:40.359 --> 21:41.837
Could be mine.

21:42.613 --> 21:43.838
Yes? Come in.

21:43.839 --> 21:45.866
I have the rest of the
patient files you asked for.

21:45.867 --> 21:46.610
Thank you.

21:46.611 --> 21:48.877
Anyone who was admitted with
Bubonic plague is in that file.

21:48.878 --> 21:50.239
Including the ones who died?

21:50.240 --> 21:51.555
- Yes.
- Thank you.

21:58.014 --> 21:59.591
Let's see.

21:59.592 --> 22:06.030
Chinese immigrant, Polish, Hungarian.

22:06.229 --> 22:09.177
Any of these patients you had
could afford private rooms?

22:09.786 --> 22:10.893
Hardly.

22:10.894 --> 22:13.499
Most couldn't even have paid their bills.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.004
Had they not been put here by the
generosity of your department and the city.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.585
Something doesn't scrime.

22:18.586 --> 22:20.952
If this much were here plus
a bunch over at Bellevue

22:20.953 --> 22:22.845
all recent arrivals to this country.

22:23.164 --> 22:25.734
How the hell did they get
through Immigration at Ellis?

22:27.200 --> 22:29.820
What do they check them for before
they let them off the island?

22:29.893 --> 22:32.418
Sent some back, even
hospitalized them there.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.954
Will this be sufficient?

22:40.804 --> 22:43.489
If your asking then that
means you got more to give.

22:46.714 --> 22:48.954
There's a dozen more wagons coming.

22:49.513 --> 22:50.580
Wonderful.

22:50.867 --> 22:52.329
Make it quick.

23:09.849 --> 23:11.844
There's plenty of food for everyone.

23:12.132 --> 23:14.222
- You got to form a line.
- (horse neighs)

23:14.586 --> 23:15.953
Please, don't push.

23:16.288 --> 23:18.179
Oh!

23:23.286 --> 23:24.569
(laughs)

23:57.958 --> 24:00.525
I'm Dr. Gallinger from the
Knickerbocker Hospital.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.351
Here to see Dr. John Thackery.

24:02.352 --> 24:03.486
Patient.

24:03.506 --> 24:06.004
I'm sorry, we have no
patient here by that name.

24:06.005 --> 24:08.056
Yes, you do.

24:08.057 --> 24:09.674
Are you family?

24:09.675 --> 24:11.342
No, a colleague.

24:11.343 --> 24:13.811
I don't know under what name
he might be registered,

24:13.812 --> 24:16.481
but he is here and I will see him.

24:16.482 --> 24:18.516
Our patients require privacy.

24:18.517 --> 24:20.685
Fella he wants won't
care a whit about that.

24:20.686 --> 24:22.369
Follow me.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.277
Mr. Crutchfield.

24:29.278 --> 24:30.862
Is it time for my med...

24:30.863 --> 24:33.197
Everett.

24:33.198 --> 24:35.249
<i>Hello, Thack.</i>

24:35.250 --> 24:36.918
What time do you have?

24:36.919 --> 24:38.635
Um...

24:39.788 --> 24:41.789
- 10:15.
- 10:15?

24:41.790 --> 24:45.677
10:15. You see that clock
on the wall says 10:10.

24:45.678 --> 24:48.880
I am due my dose in 15 minutes, not 20.

24:48.881 --> 24:51.683
You tell that Dr. Hackett
that I'm on to him.

24:51.684 --> 24:53.567
We all are.

24:54.770 --> 24:57.605
They love to experiment
here like we're mice.

24:57.606 --> 24:59.774
But I don't need to tell you that

24:59.775 --> 25:02.060
after what you went
through with Eleanor.

25:02.061 --> 25:07.065
But you don't know how to control
your environment like I do.

25:07.066 --> 25:10.818
You know, I'm like all eyes and ears.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.621
What time is it now?

25:13.622 --> 25:16.324
A minute later.

25:16.325 --> 25:18.126
You're no better than
when you came here.

25:18.127 --> 25:19.660
No, no, this place is good for me.

25:19.661 --> 25:21.913
- Good for you?
- Yeah, they have excellent treatment here.

25:21.914 --> 25:25.500
Excellent. They're just a
little stingy with it.

25:25.501 --> 25:30.505
John, you are desperately
needed back at the Knick.

25:30.506 --> 25:32.405
I'm not going back.

25:33.258 --> 25:35.093
I'm not going back.

25:35.094 --> 25:37.061
No.

25:37.062 --> 25:39.362
I can't go back.

25:40.816 --> 25:42.916
You're staying?

25:44.520 --> 25:46.904
While you're here, you
could do me a great favor.

25:46.905 --> 25:50.608
They keep all the drugs
locked in Dr. Hackett's office.

25:50.609 --> 25:51.826
Okay? Pay him a visit.

25:51.827 --> 25:53.945
Tell him you're there
to discuss my treatment.

25:53.946 --> 25:56.748
And then grab me a couple of
vials of cocaine and heroin

25:56.749 --> 25:58.866
and I'll meet you at
the kitchen entrance.

25:58.867 --> 26:00.618
Huh?

26:00.619 --> 26:02.336
Yeah?

26:02.337 --> 26:04.137
Agreed?

26:05.791 --> 26:08.024
I'll figure something out.

26:12.464 --> 26:14.447
Cornelia?

26:15.434 --> 26:16.968
Cornelia, come into the parlor.

26:16.969 --> 26:18.803
I have a surprise for you.

26:18.804 --> 26:20.304
Just arrived from New York.

26:20.305 --> 26:23.057
I'm just gonna run upstairs.

26:23.058 --> 26:24.791
What happened?

26:26.945 --> 26:29.063
It looks worse than it is.

26:29.064 --> 26:31.899
Oh, my God. What happened?

26:31.900 --> 26:33.451
Cornelia.

26:33.452 --> 26:37.288
I went to Chinatown to help.

26:37.289 --> 26:38.873
I bought them supplies.

26:38.874 --> 26:40.825
I suppose I should have told you.

26:40.826 --> 26:41.776
You suppose?

26:42.195 --> 26:43.961
You could have exposed
yourself to the Black Death.

26:43.962 --> 26:45.413
You suppose you should have told me?

26:45.414 --> 26:47.248
What if you were pregnant?
You'd be exposing our child...

26:47.249 --> 26:49.399
I'm not pregnant.

26:52.221 --> 26:55.006
Where'd you get the money
for something like that?

26:55.007 --> 26:57.008
Sold some things.

26:57.009 --> 26:58.309
What things?

26:58.310 --> 27:01.077
Some jewelry, that's all.

27:04.766 --> 27:08.019
Your grandmother's earrings.

27:08.020 --> 27:10.271
The sapphire ones your mother gave me.

27:10.272 --> 27:11.656
I know they were important,

27:11.657 --> 27:14.124
but when I thought of all
the good they could do...

27:16.361 --> 27:18.496
Mr. Showalter.

27:18.497 --> 27:21.165
<i>Cornelia.</i>

27:21.166 --> 27:23.117
What... what are you doing here?

27:23.118 --> 27:25.953
Phillip: <i>He took the train
from New York to surprise us.</i>

27:25.954 --> 27:27.955
I had some business up in Oregon.

27:27.956 --> 27:29.924
Timber and salmon.

27:29.925 --> 27:31.775
I thought I'd stop off.

27:33.545 --> 27:36.597
I'm sorry you had to see us squabble.

27:36.598 --> 27:38.599
It's my fault.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.202
It's the fire that Phillip loves in you.

27:44.223 --> 27:48.276
I... I want to explain about
your mother's earrings.

27:48.277 --> 27:51.229
They were yours to do
with as you wished.

27:51.230 --> 27:54.448
<i>Having purpose is important,</i>

27:54.449 --> 27:58.486
<i>but you already have one.</i>

27:58.487 --> 28:02.490
<i>As a wife, a future mother.</i>

28:02.491 --> 28:06.544
<i>Perhaps being so far away
from the good example</i>

28:06.545 --> 28:10.081
<i>set by your own mother
and my dear Eunice</i>

28:10.082 --> 28:12.717
<i>clouded that a bit.</i>

28:12.718 --> 28:15.253
Perhaps a bit.

28:15.254 --> 28:18.089
<i>It's so different out here.</i>

28:18.090 --> 28:20.508
<i>How can a New York girl</i>

28:20.509 --> 28:24.327
<i>be expected to get her
bearings in a place like this?</i>

28:25.764 --> 28:29.517
I don't think I've been
unduly influenced.

28:29.518 --> 28:33.571
<i>What if I arranged it</i>

28:33.572 --> 28:36.506
<i>so that you could
return to your family?</i>

28:40.612 --> 28:43.046
Leave San Francisco?

28:44.533 --> 28:46.784
But Phillip loves it so.

28:46.785 --> 28:49.754
<i>I'm sure he loves you more.</i>

28:49.755 --> 28:52.707
<i>What matters is your marriage,</i>

28:52.708 --> 28:56.377
<i>being close to family and
the people who love you.</i>

28:56.378 --> 29:00.348
I've just built some apartments
at the bottom of Central Park.

29:00.349 --> 29:04.101
I'd like you both to have one.

29:04.102 --> 29:08.405
<i>With 11 bedrooms, you can bear
as many children as you want.</i>

29:09.975 --> 29:12.310
I'll have to talk it over with Phillip.

29:12.311 --> 29:14.612
He's already decided.

29:14.613 --> 29:17.547
We were discussing it when you arrived.

29:22.904 --> 29:26.073
Thank you for letting
me know, Dr. Hackett.

29:26.074 --> 29:27.924
Good-bye.

29:31.213 --> 29:32.979
(sighs)

29:35.250 --> 29:38.351
Hello. A word, please?

29:46.261 --> 29:49.180
Has Dr. Thackery contacted you?

29:49.181 --> 29:50.663
No.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.268
Nurse Elkins...

29:54.269 --> 29:56.604
He hasn't.

29:56.605 --> 29:58.356
Is something wrong?

29:58.357 --> 30:02.693
He disappeared from Chromartie
Hospital sometime last night.

30:02.694 --> 30:04.829
- He disappeared?
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

30:04.830 --> 30:06.530
How?

30:06.531 --> 30:09.299
<i>(metal clinking)</i>

30:26.134 --> 30:28.201
Hello?

30:30.472 --> 30:32.372
Hello?

30:34.276 --> 30:36.459
Help!

30:37.529 --> 30:41.566
Hey!

30:41.567 --> 30:43.485
Help!

30:43.486 --> 30:45.703
(whimpering)

31:15.301 --> 31:17.435
Hello, Thomas.

31:17.436 --> 31:18.887
I brung you a few things.

31:18.888 --> 31:22.072
Some hard-boiled eggs and nuts.

31:23.976 --> 31:26.277
The guard will just take it all away.

31:26.278 --> 31:28.480
Oh.

31:28.481 --> 31:30.798
Let's eat it now, then.

31:34.236 --> 31:37.721
Have they set a court date yet?

31:38.541 --> 31:40.992
Week after next.

31:40.993 --> 31:42.911
Any word in the papers?

31:42.912 --> 31:44.079
No, not yet.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.381
There will be once the trial starts.

31:46.382 --> 31:50.168
You never should have taken
that job without me.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.420
Harry, we were a team.

31:52.421 --> 31:56.975
You'd have brung me and we
wouldn't be in this pickle.

31:56.976 --> 31:59.177
I'd have known if the coppers
were waiting for you.

31:59.178 --> 32:02.430
You were off getting pissed
down the Donegal Pub.

32:02.431 --> 32:04.615
All right, fair play.

32:09.739 --> 32:11.839
My name hasn't come
up at all, has it?

32:12.858 --> 32:14.526
No.

32:14.527 --> 32:17.362
You thinking of turning yourself in?

32:17.363 --> 32:20.081
- Christ, no.
- <i> (laughs)</i>

32:20.082 --> 32:22.867
I'm just slagging you.

32:22.868 --> 32:25.286
Since when did you forget
how to show your teeth?

32:25.287 --> 32:27.922
Since you got penned up in this place.

32:27.923 --> 32:30.041
<i>You can sleep easy.</i>

32:30.042 --> 32:31.793
<i>Your secret will go to my grave.</i>

32:31.794 --> 32:34.546
Well, I am not gonna let
you rot in this shitbox,

32:34.547 --> 32:38.099
<i>even if there's plenty of other folks who
want to pretend like you ain't here.</i>

32:38.100 --> 32:39.517
What are you going to do?

32:39.518 --> 32:41.519
Dig me a tunnel out? (laughs)

32:41.520 --> 32:43.555
I'm gonna do what rich folks do.

32:43.556 --> 32:44.889
I'm gonna get you a real clever lawyer

32:44.890 --> 32:48.443
with nice suits and a lot of smart words.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.562
<i>Best money can buy.</i>

32:50.563 --> 32:53.398
With what money, Mr. Carnegie?

32:53.399 --> 32:55.883
- My money.
- <i> Really?</i>

32:57.903 --> 33:00.538
Don't be doing anything foolish, Thomas,

33:00.539 --> 33:02.874
or you'll end up in here.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.726
Pouncey'll be the one bringing
you the undercooked eggs.

33:06.796 --> 33:09.080
The eggs is fine.

33:09.081 --> 33:10.415
Don't you go selling me.

33:10.416 --> 33:12.801
Don't you go selling me short.

33:12.802 --> 33:15.253
<i>I've had a little pile
stuffed in my mattress.</i>

33:15.254 --> 33:18.339
<i>Made some real smart investments.</i>

33:18.340 --> 33:21.092
<i>I'll have you out of here in no time.</i>

33:21.093 --> 33:22.927
<i>(women laughing, chattering)</i>

33:22.928 --> 33:25.230
<i>(piano playing)</i>

33:25.231 --> 33:27.065
Another early payment.

33:27.066 --> 33:30.401
Just some judicious scrimping
and saving, that's all.

33:30.402 --> 33:32.737
You'll have no problems from me.

33:32.738 --> 33:35.990
You run a good, clean establishment.

33:35.991 --> 33:38.125
Much better than Collier ever did.

33:41.489 --> 33:42.658
Mr. Collier...

33:42.750 --> 33:44.390
had very little pride.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.729
He didn't respect his women.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.433
He'd beat his girls.
Spoke to them rudely.

33:49.484 --> 33:51.068
They barely saw a doctor.

33:51.069 --> 33:55.765
Well, it's not easy to get a
doctor to do that kind of work.

33:57.067 --> 34:00.251
It is when you own the
man who runs a hospital.

34:03.886 --> 34:06.409
I think I see what you are getting at.

34:08.583 --> 34:12.914
But parading a horde of prostitutes

34:12.915 --> 34:15.005
through the Knick for examination.

34:15.533 --> 34:17.827
Would take more than a little doing.

34:20.493 --> 34:22.480
I need my women clean.

34:23.540 --> 34:27.907
I can't lose my precious inventory
to disease or whore-babies.

34:27.969 --> 34:31.335
My customers trust me to bring
them a healthy product.

34:31.913 --> 34:35.380
Once a week, I will bring
women to you to be examined.

34:36.744 --> 34:39.757
Respectfully, Mr. Ping.

34:40.088 --> 34:43.505
A hospital, like this establishment...

34:43.670 --> 34:45.507
is a business.

34:45.922 --> 34:49.438
I can't just give my
services away for free.

34:50.487 --> 34:52.954
I would have to make certain arrangements.

34:54.481 --> 34:57.310
<i>What do you propose?</i>

34:57.720 --> 34:59.099
Perhaps,

34:59.712 --> 35:01.903
a two dollar reduction in my debt

35:01.904 --> 35:04.037
for every girl examined?

35:10.999 --> 35:13.299
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

35:18.981 --> 35:20.646
A gunner's knot...

35:21.441 --> 35:24.649
is difficult to tie but
impossible to undo.

35:27.113 --> 35:28.620
Drink.

35:46.766 --> 35:50.380
My father made me memorize
every sailing knot before

35:50.381 --> 35:52.861
he let me set foot on one of his boats.

35:57.172 --> 35:58.689
Where are we?

35:58.971 --> 36:00.579
<i>The Atlantic.</i>

36:01.468 --> 36:03.909
What the hell is going on?

36:03.910 --> 36:06.021
I'm cleaning up the mess you've created.

36:06.741 --> 36:09.857
- You untie me now.
- I won't.

36:09.944 --> 36:14.276
Son of a bitch! You take
me back to Chromartie

36:14.368 --> 36:16.337
and you get me my drugs...

36:16.427 --> 36:17.793
or I will kill you.

36:17.953 --> 36:20.819
I swear I will kill you!

36:22.057 --> 36:23.086
Can you sail?

36:23.420 --> 36:25.216
- What?
- Can you sail?

36:25.217 --> 36:26.206
No!

36:26.455 --> 36:28.088
<i>It's tricky business.</i>

36:28.509 --> 36:31.627
<i>Learning to read the charts alone
is enough to drive a man mad.</i>

36:31.628 --> 36:32.845
Meaning?

36:32.846 --> 36:36.516
<i>Meaning you won't be killing me</i>

36:36.517 --> 36:39.673
and that you only have two options...

36:40.537 --> 36:41.933
Get well...

36:42.821 --> 36:44.682
or jump off.

36:44.770 --> 36:49.206
<i>(music playing)</i>

37:54.810 --> 37:59.746
(vomiting)

38:12.605 --> 38:14.122
(yells)

38:15.845 --> 38:18.680
(yells)

38:25.917 --> 38:27.578
Please untie me.

38:28.553 --> 38:30.416
I'm feeling much better.

38:32.382 --> 38:35.751
I could use... some more whiskey.

39:02.900 --> 39:04.811
- You take me back!
- No.

39:04.812 --> 39:06.934
God damn it!

39:09.487 --> 39:12.599
At least you're more in control
then you were yesterday.

39:13.456 --> 39:14.985
Not there yet.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.614
You don't understand.

39:19.634 --> 39:22.653
The need... will never go away.

39:22.654 --> 39:25.297
<i>Then you'll fight the need!</i>

39:27.736 --> 39:30.036
Don't you dare tie me up again.

39:30.123 --> 39:31.838
I'm going to make this simple.

39:32.368 --> 39:34.101
You want to go to shore?

39:34.102 --> 39:38.925
Show me you can learn to tie the first
10 knots on the chart in there.

39:39.035 --> 39:41.233
Then I'll no you're in control again.

39:45.163 --> 39:46.626
<i>10 knots!</i>

39:52.901 --> 39:54.412
Where were the bodies found?

39:54.413 --> 39:57.331
Behind the ship's boilers. Stowaways.

39:59.704 --> 40:00.847
Rats?

40:00.848 --> 40:02.462
All over the hull.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.947
Were these 2 seen anywhere on the ship?

40:04.948 --> 40:06.099
It's hard to say.

40:06.100 --> 40:09.057
Most stowaways stay hidden
until the ship docks.

40:09.071 --> 40:11.040
Then once at see they might
want some fresh air.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.395
Some food and water.

40:12.719 --> 40:16.407
Some do take... to cooking rats if
they can't steal from the kitchen.

40:17.088 --> 40:18.376
It's not *** you think?

40:18.459 --> 40:20.565
State of the bodies, the rats...

40:20.566 --> 40:21.398
Bubonic plague.

40:21.399 --> 40:23.083
Will no for sure once we get to the lab.

40:23.084 --> 40:24.925
I'll need to see the ship's manifest

40:24.926 --> 40:26.976
and a list of everyone who
went through immigration.

40:26.977 --> 40:28.742
This is private property.

40:28.743 --> 40:31.234
You tow it out of here or we'll
toss you out on your ass.

40:31.235 --> 40:32.268
I'm with the Health Department.

40:32.269 --> 40:34.813
I'm just here to check up on
a couple of friends of mine.

40:34.986 --> 40:37.152
Get a good look at what
will be killing you!

40:37.153 --> 40:40.237
What you will be bringing home
to kill your families too!

40:40.238 --> 40:41.805
The babies are the first to go usually.

40:41.806 --> 40:43.860
Dead in a pool of their
own vomit and blood.

40:43.861 --> 40:44.693
Shut your trap!

40:44.694 --> 40:46.902
(yelling)

40:46.903 --> 40:49.373
There's been some sort of monkey
business going on around here.

40:49.374 --> 40:51.664
- What do you mean?
- Meet me back here after 6:00

40:51.665 --> 40:53.488
and I'll show you the immigration records.

40:53.489 --> 40:54.522
Okay. (groans)

40:55.252 --> 40:58.516
And stay off my dock! You fucking turd!

42:07.072 --> 42:08.786
(knocking)

42:11.515 --> 42:14.470
Uhm... come in.

42:15.942 --> 42:17.442
Good morning, Doctor.

42:18.507 --> 42:19.765
Good morning.

42:22.049 --> 42:23.731
Any word from Gallinger?

42:24.802 --> 42:27.254
He's used up his last chance with me.

42:28.214 --> 42:29.101
Right.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.395
Well, I had little hope
he'd take orders from you.

42:33.233 --> 42:37.062
(clears throat) Whose assisting
you with the turburcu*** patient?

42:37.085 --> 42:38.452
I only saw my name.

42:39.919 --> 42:41.894
I'll put Maise on it with you.

42:42.636 --> 42:44.116
Maise?

42:44.221 --> 42:45.500
Not you?

42:46.271 --> 42:49.098
It's a fairly routine procedure,
I'm sure you can handle it.

42:53.997 --> 42:55.082
Great.

43:04.891 --> 43:06.730
That's quite an abscess.

43:09.002 --> 43:10.900
Let's hope we won't have to amputate.

43:19.036 --> 43:20.871
Perhaps I'll begin.

43:20.872 --> 43:22.236
Nurse, knife.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.384
(clears throat)

43:25.452 --> 43:28.237
I will dissect down to the bone.

43:28.945 --> 43:30.710
See how much puss is in there.

43:32.658 --> 43:34.542
Unless you have other thoughts?

43:34.733 --> 43:36.564
Oh, I think that sounds right.

43:49.502 --> 43:52.261
I'm a... well-acquainted with your father.

43:53.169 --> 43:57.347
We were recently seated near each
other at an Art Society dinner.

43:58.394 --> 44:01.294
Well, it was really more of an
excuse to drink good wine...

44:01.295 --> 44:04.108
and show off our french.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.167
That's nice.

44:05.168 --> 44:06.292
All right, I'm through.

44:06.293 --> 44:08.089
Suction wand.

44:08.984 --> 44:12.439
Will you be *** I'm cleaning now.

44:13.543 --> 44:15.204
Yes, of course.

44:26.694 --> 44:28.385
Do you need assistance?

44:28.547 --> 44:33.492
- I'm not exactly and expert
in this technique. - Gauze.

44:43.899 --> 44:45.913
Nice work, Dr. Chickering.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.448
Very nice.

44:51.927 --> 44:54.243
<i>- (thunder rumbling)
- (metal clinking)</i>

45:30.215 --> 45:32.231
<i>(marching band playing)</i>

45:41.533 --> 45:45.952
Barrow: Thank you for
being here, Mr. Mayor.

45:46.454 --> 45:50.291
This groundbreaking is made much more
special by your presence here today.

45:50.292 --> 45:53.043
(chuckles) You couldn't
have done this in April?

45:53.044 --> 45:55.162
I'm freezing my balls off.

45:55.163 --> 45:58.215
- (chuckles)
- Well, I am sorry about that.

45:58.216 --> 46:01.051
Allow me to introduce
you to our architect.

46:01.052 --> 46:03.304
This is Mr. Frazier H. Wingo

46:03.305 --> 46:05.089
of the firm Bradley and Wingo.

46:05.090 --> 46:06.891
- Mr. Wingo.
- It's a pleasure.

46:06.892 --> 46:08.627
We have to grace our
city with the finest,

46:08.628 --> 46:10.139
most beautiful hospital in the world.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.140
Yes, and it won't cost you a dime.

46:12.141 --> 46:13.559
All private funds.

46:13.560 --> 46:15.093
Which we are still raising.

46:15.094 --> 46:16.762
We will get there.

46:16.763 --> 46:18.897
Captain Robertson assures me of that.

46:18.898 --> 46:20.482
Oh, is he here today?

46:20.483 --> 46:22.768
August has always been a
strong supporter of mine.

46:22.769 --> 46:24.770
He wanted to be. He is in Norfolk.

46:24.771 --> 46:27.406
Seems he's having some new ships built.

46:27.407 --> 46:29.608
But his son Henry is here instead

46:29.609 --> 46:32.361
representing the family
quite well indeed.

46:32.362 --> 46:35.247
Point him out to me so this
isn't a complete waste of time.

46:35.248 --> 46:36.331
Yes, of course.

46:36.332 --> 46:39.501
(music continues)

46:39.502 --> 46:41.587
Henry: People will know
the names of the men,

46:41.588 --> 46:45.540
of the families, really, who gave
generously to build this hospital.

46:45.541 --> 46:48.176
Aside from our name on a plaque

46:48.177 --> 46:50.879
and our portrait in a hallway,
there's no real payoff.

46:50.880 --> 46:54.883
The payoff, Prettyman, is assuring
your place in God's kingdom.

46:54.884 --> 46:58.103
Yeah, well, your family
can think about legacy,

46:58.104 --> 47:00.305
but I'm still building my fortune.

47:00.306 --> 47:02.307
Every penny I have is tied up

47:02.308 --> 47:05.978
in winning the contract to
build the new subway line.

47:05.979 --> 47:07.896
Where will it run?

47:07.897 --> 47:11.048
From city hall all the
way up to 145th Street.

47:12.068 --> 47:16.071
Do you have all the funds you need?

47:16.072 --> 47:19.557
Enough to rig the bid, but short
of what I need to get it done.

47:20.660 --> 47:22.294
Oh, look at that.

47:22.295 --> 47:24.046
You were looking to empty my wallet,

47:24.047 --> 47:26.597
but I might just end up emptying yours.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.251
Guess who.

47:29.252 --> 47:31.253
- Uh, Daisy.
- No.

47:31.254 --> 47:34.056
- Constance?
- (laughs) For heaven's sake.

47:34.057 --> 47:36.008
I've barely been gone and you've already

47:36.009 --> 47:38.560
run roughshod over every
girl in New York.

47:38.561 --> 47:40.945
- Neely Doll!
- We're back.

47:43.316 --> 47:45.183
I didn't expect you so soon.

47:45.184 --> 47:47.451
I wanted to be here
for the groundbreaking.

47:49.856 --> 47:52.157
Oh, Harold. You remember Harold?

47:52.158 --> 47:54.526
- Yes. Good morning.
- Good morning.

47:54.527 --> 47:57.545
We'll finish talking about
that opportunity later.

47:58.998 --> 48:02.000
I swear to you, I will never
leave this city ever again.

48:02.001 --> 48:03.919
- Well, I won't let you.
- (laughs)

48:03.920 --> 48:06.254
- Where's Phillip?
- Oh, he's taken the baggage

48:06.255 --> 48:08.340
and is getting us settled
in our new apartment.

48:08.341 --> 48:10.641
Algie. Algie, look who it is.

48:12.929 --> 48:14.212
<i>Cornelia?</i>

48:14.213 --> 48:16.631
Oh, he's as surprised as I am.

48:16.632 --> 48:19.200
She's back for good.

48:20.386 --> 48:22.570
Come with me. I have
something to show you.

48:27.727 --> 48:29.444
Stand there together.

48:29.445 --> 48:31.146
Cornelia: <i>What is that thing?</i>

48:31.147 --> 48:32.731
A moving picture camera.

48:32.732 --> 48:35.033
Purchased it from Mr. Edison's company.

48:35.034 --> 48:36.735
Stand closer together.

48:36.736 --> 48:39.738
A little to the left.

48:39.739 --> 48:42.074
Henry.

48:42.075 --> 48:45.327
Mayor Van Wyck would love a
word if you have a moment.

48:45.328 --> 48:47.645
Excuse us. Yeah?

48:50.917 --> 48:52.918
Mayor Van Wyck, this is Henry Robertson.

48:52.919 --> 48:56.254
- Cornelia: Phillip.
- Algernon.

48:56.255 --> 48:58.739
- Welcome back, Phillip.
- Thank you so much.

49:00.593 --> 49:02.094
Couldn't miss this, could you?

49:02.095 --> 49:04.262
Not for the world.

49:04.263 --> 49:06.148
How's the apartment?

49:06.149 --> 49:08.683
- Not finished, apparently.
- What?

49:08.684 --> 49:10.819
My father assumed it would be completed,

49:10.820 --> 49:14.171
but ran into some slowdowns
while he was travelling.

49:15.108 --> 49:16.658
We could live with my parents.

49:16.659 --> 49:18.610
It's all been taken care of.

49:18.611 --> 49:20.746
Dad felt terribly about the delay,

49:20.747 --> 49:23.615
so he insisted all our things be
brought to their house immediately.

49:23.616 --> 49:25.951
An entire floor has
been prepared for us.

49:25.952 --> 49:29.121
We'll be living in your father's house?

49:29.122 --> 49:31.289
For how long?

49:31.290 --> 49:33.291
Four months at the most.

49:33.292 --> 49:35.627
Maybe five.

49:35.628 --> 49:37.561
It'll be fun.

49:43.436 --> 49:46.021
Barrow: <i>Ah, all right, everyone.</i>

49:46.022 --> 49:47.389
We're all set.

49:47.390 --> 49:49.858
Let's man our shovels,
shall we, gentlemen?

49:49.859 --> 49:52.861
Right this way. Very good.

49:52.862 --> 49:56.114
Photographers, reporters, this way.

49:56.115 --> 49:58.867
Up front. Thank you.

49:58.868 --> 50:00.902
Gentlemen, if we could come

50:00.903 --> 50:03.288
to the lip of the stage
for the photograph.

50:03.289 --> 50:05.490
Thank you.

50:05.491 --> 50:07.325
All right, my friends.

50:07.326 --> 50:09.327
Shovels ready.

50:09.328 --> 50:12.547
Now remember, this will be
in every paper in the city,

50:12.548 --> 50:15.333
so let's give it our all.

50:15.334 --> 50:16.668
Hold on a moment.

50:16.669 --> 50:19.236
I seem to have one too many shovels.

50:21.507 --> 50:23.975
Dr. Edwards.

50:23.976 --> 50:26.243
Please, come join us.

50:27.730 --> 50:31.933
It's only fitting that our
acting chief of surgery

50:31.934 --> 50:35.153
shows us how to make a
first cut into the earth.

50:35.154 --> 50:38.240
Could've given it to the police chief.

50:38.241 --> 50:40.992
- Is this your idea of taking it slow?
- I couldn't resist.

50:40.993 --> 50:43.745
All right, everyone,
on the count of three.

50:43.746 --> 50:46.948
One, two, three.

50:46.949 --> 50:48.849
<i>(applause, cheering)</i>

50:52.288 --> 50:53.622
Mr. Wingo.

50:53.623 --> 50:55.806
Masterful. Well done.

51:08.888 --> 51:11.071
I've had a revelation.

51:13.276 --> 51:16.444
If I was up against a medical problem,

51:16.445 --> 51:18.712
I would look for a cure.

51:20.316 --> 51:22.484
Stop the disease.

51:22.485 --> 51:25.169
Mend the bone, staunch the bleeding.

51:30.409 --> 51:32.593
That's the goal anyway.

51:34.330 --> 51:37.132
If I treat my desire for drugs

51:37.133 --> 51:41.586
not as a craving, but as a sickness,

51:41.587 --> 51:44.104
that means there must be a cure.

51:46.259 --> 51:49.094
And if there is,

51:49.095 --> 51:50.944
I'm gonna find it.

52:01.607 --> 52:03.707
Number 10.

52:10.499 --> 52:12.466
Let's go home.

52:30.102 --> 52:32.202
Nice view.
