02:38.993 --> 02:40.495
Hey, Douglas. How's it going?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.373
What did you do?

02:44.874 --> 02:46.625
Demo'ed the driveway.

02:46.626 --> 02:47.835
(SIGHS)

02:49.003 --> 02:50.963
Yeah. Nice job, too.

02:51.923 --> 02:52.924
What's the problem?

02:54.133 --> 02:55.176
Well, you know...

02:56.219 --> 02:57.595
It's the wrong driveway.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.515
That's a problem, don't you think?

03:01.015 --> 03:04.602
2933, Vic. This is 2935!

03:06.312 --> 03:08.231
Hey! We're in the wrong...

03:09.524 --> 03:11.150
These guys are morons.

03:12.235 --> 03:15.738
I hate to say this, Doug.
Whoa, this is gonna cost.

03:16.072 --> 03:17.240
It's going to cost who?

03:17.740 --> 03:20.700
Doug. I'm in a bad way right now.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.703
I mean, money's very tight
with me, okay.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.206
Doug, I do know can't afford
to eat this, okay,

03:26.207 --> 03:28.458
even if it was my fault,
which I'm not saying it was

03:28.459 --> 03:29.584
until I talk to an attorney.

03:29.585 --> 03:31.294
- Shut up, Vic. Shut up.
- (CLEARS THROAT)

03:31.295 --> 03:32.296
What am I going to do?

03:33.089 --> 03:34.674
Oh, man. What am I gonna do?

03:36.342 --> 03:38.468
All right. Here's what we're gonna do.
Here's what we're gonna do.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.596
We're gonna get right to work
and we're gonna do both driveways, okay?

03:41.097 --> 03:42.764
I don't care how long it takes,

03:42.765 --> 03:44.516
nobody goes home until we're finished.

03:44.517 --> 03:47.310
And if you say one more word
to me, Vic, I swear to God,

03:47.311 --> 03:48.937
one more word for the rest of the day,

03:48.938 --> 03:50.105
I'm gonna take a drywall hammer

03:50.106 --> 03:51.607
and I'm gonna beat you
to death with it.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.276
- You got it?
- Makes total sense to me.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.653
Doug. Thank you.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.576
(PHONE RINGING)

04:06.122 --> 04:09.500
Hello. Kinney. Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Eddie. How ya doing?

04:09.917 --> 04:11.209
Problem this morning, huh?

04:11.210 --> 04:12.502
Giving away free driveways?

04:12.503 --> 04:13.753
You can always come to my place.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.880
Why you always have a crack
when you come into the door?

04:14.881 --> 04:16.505
Why do you have to say something, huh?

04:16.507 --> 04:19.091
No. Hey, listen, go ahead
and fax those plans over.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.176
- (PHONE RINGING)
- Right now.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.846
Yeah. Hold on a second.
I got another call.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.599
Hello? Oh, hey, hi, hon.
I was just gonna call you.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.809
What's the matter?

04:27.727 --> 04:33.607
Oh, really? No, no, I know what it is.
No. It's the hot water heater.

04:33.608 --> 04:34.609
I've been meaning to fix it.

04:36.319 --> 04:37.320
Oh, shit.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.531
Frank! My fax machine's
gone psycho again.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.408
- DEL: Doug.
- Oh. Yo.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.785
What's up?

04:46.203 --> 04:47.496
Do you hate me?

04:47.955 --> 04:50.665
- No, Del, I don't hate you.
- Why are you trying to end my life?

04:50.666 --> 04:53.084
I got this guy in Beverly Hills
who's straight up my nose

04:53.085 --> 04:54.544
says he's gonna sue me.

04:54.545 --> 04:57.005
You destroyed his driveway?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.674
Yeah, yeah, we did.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.300
What, like a prank?

05:00.301 --> 05:03.053
(SCOFFS) No, not like a prank, Del.

05:03.054 --> 05:05.180
Look, don't even think about it.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.557
Don't give it a second thought,
it's my responsibility.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.061
And I'm gonna go back out there,
and I'm gonna fix it on my own time.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.395
Oh, yeah? What time would that be?

05:12.396 --> 05:15.107
'Cause Ted told me you still
haven't finished the Malibu job yet.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.609
You know what I think?

05:18.778 --> 05:20.738
No, Ted, what do you think?

05:21.572 --> 05:23.699
I think we're going to have to put in
some more hours here.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.575
I mean this isn't
just a nine-to-five job.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.911
That's not going to get it done.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.871
There was a saying where I worked last.

05:29.914 --> 05:33.417
"If you don't come in on Saturday,
don't bother coming in Sunday."

05:34.961 --> 05:36.419
You're talking about working weekends.

05:36.420 --> 05:39.214
I'm talking about working weekends,
nights, holidays. Whatever it takes.

05:39.215 --> 05:40.216
I'm ready.

05:41.676 --> 05:43.344
My office. Two minutes.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.034
Hey, do you have any stegosauruses?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.285
- (DOOR SLAMS)
- (SIGHS) No. I have

06:09.286 --> 06:10.913
an iguanodon and a tyrannosaurus.

06:15.126 --> 06:17.043
I fished a stegosaurus. Hey, Dad.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.170
- Hey, dude. How you doing?
- Good.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.715
Good hand. Hey, dude.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.426
Did you look at the hot water heater?

06:24.135 --> 06:25.636
Honey, I just walked in the door.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.887
Okay, Zack. No bath tonight.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.098
All right!

06:29.557 --> 06:31.517
- Yes!
- Brush your teeth and go to bed.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.272
You missed Campfire Girls.

06:36.605 --> 06:40.276
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Honey, I'm not in Campfire Girls.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.069
I'm a Brownie.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.155
It was Jennifer's graduation.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.616
Oh, man, I forgot!

06:48.868 --> 06:51.077
- I phoned and reminded you.
- I know.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.496
(SIGHS) I know. I'm sorry.

06:53.414 --> 06:57.168
I totally forgot. My fault.
Was she upset?

06:57.501 --> 07:00.086
'Course. Every other father was there.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.714
Including the divorced ones.

07:03.007 --> 07:04.717
- What about the lesbian moms?
- Both of them.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.553
All right, where is she now?

07:08.220 --> 07:09.764
She's in the den, drinking.

07:10.639 --> 07:11.640
Funny.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.602
She's asleep.
Where were you? You said you would come.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.771
I had to work late, babe.

07:17.646 --> 07:20.732
I had to work late.
King fired Richie DeGrazzi.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.568
You're kidding. Why?

07:22.985 --> 07:25.404
'Cause he does bad work.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.698
I will say this for him,
though. He does it really slowly.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.117
So who'd he get to replace him?

07:30.701 --> 07:33.788
I'll give you a hint.
You sleep with him.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.207
The video store guy.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.502
Yeah. Video store guy.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.503
I knew you were dating,
I just wasn't sure

07:41.504 --> 07:42.671
if you were sleeping with him or not.

07:44.090 --> 07:47.134
God, honey, that's great.
So, it's like a promotion.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.886
Yeah, yeah.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.304
It's not great?

07:50.679 --> 07:52.807
Well, guess who's gonna do
all the work that I was doing?

07:53.808 --> 07:55.226
You're gonna do all those jobs?

07:55.768 --> 07:58.436
Are they gonna give you more money?

07:58.437 --> 08:01.065
Ah, I think it's more
of a prestige thing, hon.

08:01.732 --> 08:02.857
Uh, yeah, that's probably it.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.234
They'll probably give me a plaque

08:04.235 --> 08:06.987
or a certificate or something
for being so great.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.197
(SIGHING) Oh, God.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.407
No, this is ridiculous.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.451
I mean, we hardly ever see you now.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.287
Can you just tell them
you don't want to do it?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.455
Yeah. Sure, I can say no.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.166
If you want to start
catching your own food.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.460
Don't worry, babe. I can handle it.

08:22.086 --> 08:24.797
It'll be okay.
I'll go check on the water heater.

Oh, gosh, you know, I don't know.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.583
I'm gonna have to think about that.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.919
(SIGHS) Well, you know,
I really appreciate it.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.921
Hey.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.632
Thanks. Thank you.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.804
Okay. Well, you know, I'll call you.
Thanks. All right. Bye.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.599
- How you doing?
- Hey. You hungry?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.808
No. I'm too tired to eat.

09:18.809 --> 09:20.102
I'm just gonna have some cereal.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.479
So, who was that?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.064
Valerie.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.066
Valerie! Hey!

09:26.901 --> 09:28.359
Who helped her dial the phone?

09:28.360 --> 09:30.905
Don't start. The company
just made her regional manager.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.365
- No kidding.
- You know, it is so weird.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.993
When I quit work to have Zack,
I mean, I was way ahead of her.

09:36.994 --> 09:38.829
They thought much
more of me than they did of Valerie.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.624
She just called you up
to tell you how great she's doing?

09:42.750 --> 09:46.754
Well, no. She offered me her old job,
now that she's been promoted.

09:52.593 --> 09:53.594
So, uh...

09:55.346 --> 09:58.515
You thinking about
going back to work selling real estate?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.726
Well, yeah. What do you think?

10:04.521 --> 10:05.731
What do I think?

10:07.858 --> 10:10.735
You know, let's see.
First couple of months,

10:10.736 --> 10:12.947
you'll be making practically nothing,
right?

10:13.489 --> 10:15.115
'Cause, you know, it's hard.

10:15.449 --> 10:19.035
Then, uh, you know, we're paying out
more money for child care.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.622
You're working, I'm working,
you know... I don't know.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.875
Next thing you know,
we're both not going to Campfire Girls.

10:25.251 --> 10:29.004
Well, I was thinking if you could just
help out a little more with the kids.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.839
How, when? How am I going
to work that out?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.677
I just meant, you know, in emergencies.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.764

I'm not going back to work, am I?

10:49.233 --> 10:54.029
We always said I would someday,
but now I realize I never will.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.031
I...

10:57.574 --> 11:00.077
Take my job, okay? You go build condos.

Well, with all due respect,
I forgot to go to medical school.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.137
I can help you.

14:06.472 --> 14:07.598
Help me how?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.141
Change your life.

14:12.644 --> 14:15.063
What is it that you guys do around here?

14:16.982 --> 14:18.233
We make miracles.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.199
Sure.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.079
Call me.

14:31.747 --> 14:35.082
(SIGHS) I feel guilty because
I don't spend enough

14:35.083 --> 14:36.918
time with my wife and my kids.

14:36.919 --> 14:40.005
And then I...
I get resentful about it

14:40.422 --> 14:42.632
because I feel like I should

14:42.633 --> 14:45.593
you know, maybe
get a little time for myself.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.680
It's like work is first
and my family is a close second

14:49.681 --> 14:52.684
and I'm a... I'm a distant third
bringing up the rear, you know.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.772
(SIGHS) I don't know. Is that crazy?

14:58.232 --> 15:00.484
I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.237
Anyway, you don't need one.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.697
These problems are not in your mind.
They're real.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.325
They require real solutions.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.285
Well, then...

15:11.828 --> 15:13.038
What do you do?

15:14.498 --> 15:16.959
I told you. I make miracles.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.212
I create time.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.800
I make clones.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.221
Okay, uh...

15:30.222 --> 15:32.766
Doug. (CHUCKLING) Sit down.

15:34.393 --> 15:39.438
I'm a geneticist. Fifteen years ago,
I started cloning viruses.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.941
Can't have too many viruses.

15:41.692 --> 15:44.361
And then, ten years ago,
I cloned an earthworm.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.490
God bless you, sir.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.286
And then a chimp.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.247
Yeah.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.457
And then last year...

15:59.167 --> 16:00.210
Well...

16:01.878 --> 16:03.337
Last year...

16:03.338 --> 16:05.340
(MAN HUMMING)

16:08.677 --> 16:10.219
Hi, there.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.639
- Ah. Just in time.
- Oh, hello.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.393
This is Doug Kinney.
He's doing our new offices.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.729
Oh, sure. I know Doug.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.939
- He and I went over the plans one day.
- Oh?

16:21.940 --> 16:24.443
- Yeah. You were sailing.
- Ah.

16:26.528 --> 16:27.529
(CHUCKLES)

16:28.697 --> 16:30.948
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.160
You understand what I'm suggesting?

16:33.869 --> 16:35.329
Yeah, sure.

16:36.246 --> 16:39.415
What's not to understand?
You, uh... You Xerox people.

16:39.416 --> 16:40.626
- In a way.
- Sort of. (CHUCKLES)

16:42.002 --> 16:44.462
The procedure takes about two hours.

16:44.463 --> 16:47.007
- I don't know about that.
- It takes more or less two hours.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.802
Then at the end, you have
everything you need.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.557
What is it that, uh, you know,
that... That I need?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.517
BOTH: Time.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.479
- Time.
- Time!

17:01.480 --> 17:02.939
All you need. For everything.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.278
Let's say I was interested, you know...
(STAMMERS) What would a, uh...

17:08.737 --> 17:09.738
You know...

17:10.489 --> 17:13.406
Nothing fancy,
just a basic... Just, you know...

17:13.407 --> 17:19.164
Just a basic, uh...
You know, clone job cost?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.297
- Doctor, we're ready for you.
- Very good. Very good.

17:27.756 --> 17:28.757
Hey, Doc.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.220
I hate to sound like a baby,
but just promise me

17:33.887 --> 17:35.346
everything's gonna be all right.

17:35.347 --> 17:37.723
Doug, you're going to be fine.
There's nothing to worry about.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.853
Thanks, thanks. I'm not gonna
turn out to like these guys, am I?

17:42.187 --> 17:43.563
- I hope not. (LAUGHS)
- Okay.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.900
- Watch your head.
- Oh, God...

17:47.693 --> 17:49.194
(HUMMING)

17:51.238 --> 17:54.241
That's right. Just lie back
and put your feet in the stirrups.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.744
Sorry, but did you see that movie,
<i>The Fly?</i>

17:58.745 --> 18:00.246
- Mmm-hmm.
- Remember, Jeff Goldblum comes out

18:00.247 --> 18:02.665
and he's got these enormous eyes.
You know, I mean...

18:02.666 --> 18:06.585
Peripheral vision is one thing,
but, you know, this is a bad look.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.881
And he's always eating everything
with these little hands and everything.

18:10.882 --> 18:11.966
(MUMBLES)

18:11.967 --> 18:14.719
- Relax now. Take it easy.
- All right. I'm sorry.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.054
- Okay.
- That's right.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.641
Yeah, well... Ow!
What the hell is that thing?

18:20.308 --> 18:22.017
This is just going to help you relax.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.770
- Well... So far it isn't working.
- (CHUCKLES)

18:24.771 --> 18:30.109
(SIGHS) I'm sorry. My uncle went in
for routine dental work,

18:30.110 --> 18:31.737
and he came out, he was never the same.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.322
I don't know if he got that...
You know, that suction thing

18:35.323 --> 18:37.533
actually lodged in his throat or what

18:37.534 --> 18:39.785
but after that he was always...
(SNORTING)

18:39.786 --> 18:41.996
"Hey, Doug... What's wrong?"
He, like, something...

18:41.997 --> 18:43.789
Count backwards from 100.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.709
Sure. Like that's gonna work.

18:46.418 --> 18:47.753
One hundred...

18:56.219 --> 18:57.679

(EKG BEEPING)

20:00.784 --> 20:01.868
Am I all right?

20:02.619 --> 20:03.829
You're fine. (CHUCKLES)

20:06.832 --> 20:09.459
Hey. Well?

20:10.961 --> 20:13.420
(STAMMERING) I mean...
Is it... Did it...

20:13.421 --> 20:17.676
Is it a boy? Did it work?

20:23.849 --> 20:25.266
Is that it?

20:25.267 --> 20:26.810
(CHUCKLING) No. I'm afraid you're it.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.438
What do you mean I'm it? I can't be it.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.440
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:33.775 --> 20:36.403
- You mean, you think I'm the clone?
- (LAUGHS) That's right.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.657
I can't be the clone.
I'm me. He's gotta be the clone.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.326
No, no. See, I'm... I'm me.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.621
I'm me. Help me out here.
I am me, right?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.291
Look here. (LAUGHING)

20:50.292 --> 20:52.002
- Sit up.
- I gotta be me.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.587
(CLEARS THROAT) Hold this.

20:55.297 --> 20:58.550
Atta boy. Now, look here.

21:03.597 --> 21:04.931
You see that?

21:05.348 --> 21:07.058
- I see a "2."
- Mmm-hmm.

21:08.643 --> 21:09.853
There you go.

21:13.273 --> 21:16.066
Wait a minute. (CLEARS THROAT)
I remember everything.

21:16.067 --> 21:20.655
I remember coming in here.
I remember putting this thing on.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.740
- I remember getting the shot.
- Of course.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.159
You have all of Doug's feelings,
all his quirks,

21:25.160 --> 21:28.121
all of his memories
right up to the moment of cloning.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.247
But from now on,

21:30.248 --> 21:32.958
to whatever you extent
you have different experiences,

21:32.959 --> 21:34.294
then you'll begin to diverge.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.046
What, uh...
What do I feed it?

21:37.923 --> 21:40.341
Feed it? What am I? A hamster?

21:40.342 --> 21:42.676
Sorry, sorry.
Bad choice of words. I didn't mean that.

21:42.677 --> 21:44.637
You know, I mean, it eats something.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.556
He's a person, just like you.

21:47.599 --> 21:50.809
Now, we'll provide him
with duplicate identification

21:50.810 --> 21:52.227
some clothes to wear home.

21:52.228 --> 21:53.855
- You take care of the rest.
- Yeah.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.901
Now I'm going to leave you two alone.
You'll have a lot to talk about.

21:58.777 --> 22:00.195
I'll be in my office.

22:02.697 --> 22:03.907
Astonishing.

22:04.991 --> 22:05.992
(CHUCKLES)

22:19.422 --> 22:22.884
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

22:24.678 --> 22:25.679
(SIGHS)

22:28.056 --> 22:32.060
So, uh... Where are you from?
(CHUCKLES)

22:35.313 --> 22:38.482
All right. Stay down low.
Really low. Really low.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.402
CLONE: Lower than this?
You want me to get under the car?

22:41.695 --> 22:43.613
Good, good, good. Laura's not home.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.532
Okay.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.920
The Mildew Suite.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.589
Don't worry. We're gonna fix it all up.

23:03.216 --> 23:04.884
I'm really going to be
living up here, huh?

23:06.094 --> 23:07.678
Well... (SIGHS)

23:07.679 --> 23:10.432
I mean, you can't live
in the house with me and Laura.

23:10.724 --> 23:12.099
I mean, how would that work?

23:12.100 --> 23:14.561
You know, Laura wakes up
in the morning, rolls over, and says,

23:14.728 --> 23:18.022
"Doug, Doug, you two better get off
to work 'cause y'all are gonna be late."

23:18.023 --> 23:19.566
(CHUCKLING) You know what I mean?
I mean...

23:20.608 --> 23:22.026
Hey, don't worry about it.

23:22.027 --> 23:24.028
I'm telling you.
We'll clean some stuff out of here,

23:24.029 --> 23:25.988
we'll put some rugs down,
get a TV, get a stereo.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.906
- It could be a cool place.
- Hey, you know what we gotta get?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.200
We ought to get
one of those satellite dishes.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.662
You know? Get every sport going,
get all the movies...

23:33.288 --> 23:35.248
(STRAINING) I don't know about that...

23:35.957 --> 23:37.332
(STRAINING) What is that?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.752
I don't know if Laura's
gonna go for that.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.504
Oh, man. I knew it. You're whipped.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.630
Who said I'm whipped? I'm not whipped.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.091
- Yeah, yeah, you're whipped, partner.
- I'm not whipped!

23:46.092 --> 23:48.844
- You're... (IMITATES WHIP)
- Fine, I'm whipped.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.096
Hey... Hey, some guys are whipped.
It's okay.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.140
No, you're right.
That's right. That's right.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.268
Anyway, look,
we've got to get a plan together.

23:55.935 --> 23:56.936
Hey, look at this.

23:57.395 --> 24:00.273
Think fast. You could wear these
till you get some of your own.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.067
Hey, don't make me...

24:03.068 --> 24:05.360
I don't want to come over there
and kick your ass, okay?

24:05.361 --> 24:06.571
Come on. Come on. Get ready.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.699
Hey, I don't want...
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.077
Look at this. I wondered where this is.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.830
This is a great coat.
I love this old coat.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.917
Okay, now to be safe,
always use the garden gate

24:19.918 --> 24:21.252
when you come in and out of the alley.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.253
We should probably
black out these windows too.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.172
Huh? Yeah. Good idea. Good idea.
What else?

24:25.173 --> 24:26.924
We're gonna have to come up
with a strategy for work.

24:26.925 --> 24:27.926
- All right, good.
- That's very important.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.804
Between the two of us,
we're going to get a lot of stuff done.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.848
- We're going to kick some ass.
- We're going to be awesome.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.184
- (CHUCKLES) And Ted...
- We're going to destroy Ted.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.851
- We'll ruin him.
- We must bring Ted down.

24:37.852 --> 24:39.228
- Yes.
- We must crush Ted.

24:39.229 --> 24:41.730
(BOTH TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

24:41.731 --> 24:44.024

- We could car pool, if you want.
- No.

25:53.887 --> 25:54.888
I could pick you up.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.266
- Morning.
- (GASPS) Doug! When did you get here?

25:59.267 --> 26:01.769
6:00. Make copies of those,
would you? Half day today, Teddy?

26:01.978 --> 26:03.062

26:05.023 --> 26:06.106
Sure.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.989

- No, I'm fine.

How about it?

26:18.036 --> 26:21.289
Sure.
Find out what he had for breakfast.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.666
I'd be happy to.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.885
Morning, pretty. Meeting start yet?

already in the meeting.

How could I already be...

26:39.974 --> 26:41.391
Did you see me in the meeting?

26:41.392 --> 26:44.395
I thought I did,
but you were wearing a different shirt.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.857
Yeah, I was. I was.

26:48.858 --> 26:50.568
I was wearing a different shirt.
You know why?

26:51.194 --> 26:52.362
I spilled coffee on it.

26:53.071 --> 26:56.865
So then I, uh, decided I'd go back
to the truck while you were, uh...

26:56.866 --> 26:57.950
In the ladies room?

26:57.951 --> 27:02.496
Perfect, and, uh, I figured I would, uh,
you know, get another shirt,

27:02.497 --> 27:03.747
which I keep for emergencies.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.082
You know.
You never know what's gonna happen...

27:05.083 --> 27:08.043
I might, uh, well, spill coffee on it,
you know, like I did,

27:08.044 --> 27:09.045
so good thing I got the shirt.

27:09.420 --> 27:11.631
And also I got my briefcase
which I needed for the meeting.

27:11.923 --> 27:14.217
And then I came back,
and I forgot the meeting had started.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.261
I forgot the meeting had started, yes.

27:17.262 --> 27:18.263
So, shouldn't you go back in?

27:18.846 --> 27:21.348
Yeah, I should. I'm going to.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.225
But, see, I gotta go
out to the truck, now.

27:23.226 --> 27:26.353
And I gotta get the original shirt,
which is, you know, probably dry now.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.356
And also, truthfully, I like it better.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.400
So the next time you see me,
I'll be coming out of the meeting.

27:31.401 --> 27:33.361
Right through the front,
in the original shirt.

27:34.612 --> 27:35.863
Are you okay? (CHUCKLES)

27:36.406 --> 27:39.242
No problem.
Never been better. Just great.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.535
Just great. Why don't you just...

27:41.536 --> 27:43.913
Just between you and me,
forget it ever happened, okay?

27:46.124 --> 27:48.000
WOMAN: <i>Good morning,

27:48.001 --> 27:49.585
(IN HEAVY VOICE)
Uh, yeah, is Doug Kinney there?

27:50.211 --> 27:52.546
<i>I think he's in a meeting.
May I ask who's calling?</i>

27:52.547 --> 27:55.300
Uh, it's, uh... Uh, Carl.

27:55.633 --> 27:58.219
<i>- Who?</i>
- Roger.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.929
<i>Roger who?</i>

28:01.514 --> 28:04.809
Uh, Carl Rogerson.
Tell him Carl Rogerson's calling.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.061
- Phone call for you, Doug.
- Thanks.

28:09.897 --> 28:10.981
Yeah, Kinney.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.357
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Hey, what's going on?

28:12.358 --> 28:15.652
<i>- Who the hell is this?</i>
- It's me. It's... You know,

28:15.653 --> 28:17.530
It's you. It's us. You know who it is.

28:18.031 --> 28:21.367
Uh, yeah, yeah.
(STAMMERS) Hold on a second.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.994
I'm gonna take this in my office.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.122
Oh, man, I'm too busy to talk to myself.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.919
- What's up?
<i>- What's up? What are you doing there?</i>

28:32.211 --> 28:33.462
What do you mean? Where should I be?

28:33.463 --> 28:35.756
Well, I mean, you know,
you kind of just went to work?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.716
I came looking for you
and you were gone already.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.259
Yeah, well,
I thought that was the whole idea.

28:39.260 --> 28:41.345
I thought I'd come to work
so you can spend more time at home.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.471
<i>Yeah, no, it is.</i>

28:42.472 --> 28:44.223
<i>I mean, that's the idea. But, you know,
we got to discuss these things.</i>

28:44.432 --> 28:46.893
We gotta kinda coordinate some stuff.
You know what I mean?

28:47.393 --> 28:48.853
Anyway, how's it going?

28:49.270 --> 28:50.938
<i>Good. Good. Everything's under control.</i>

28:51.606 --> 28:52.981
Really? Good.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.358
Hey, look. I'll go out to the Palisades.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.402
I gotta wrap up some stuff here
and I gotta go, okay?

28:57.028 --> 28:58.696
Okay, then I'm gonna go by Sherman Oaks
and check on that.

28:59.489 --> 29:01.115
<i>Already took care of it, pal.
Everything's fine.</i>

29:01.741 --> 29:05.202
Oh, okay.
I'll go to North Hollywood then.

29:05.203 --> 29:06.954
No, I'm gonna go by there
on my way out to the Palisades.

29:07.997 --> 29:09.499
- Reseda?
<i>- Already did it.</i>

29:11.584 --> 29:13.460
Wow. Okay.

29:13.461 --> 29:16.589
Uh... I'll tell you what then... Um...

29:18.007 --> 29:19.132
What should I do?

29:19.133 --> 29:20.675
Hey, I don't know, partner.

29:20.676 --> 29:21.760
Start living it up, I guess.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.096
Have a good time. I gotta go. See you.

But you're not fooling anybody
with this new go-go attitude.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.027
You read me?

29:38.945 --> 29:39.946
Got it.

29:46.244 --> 29:48.788
I'm on top of you. I see you, my friend.

and watch my kid eat oranges.

- Yeah, that's all I have to play him.

God. I'm out here
doing the best I can do.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.481
Absolutely.
That's all you can ask out of a guy.

31:39.482 --> 31:41.608
It's not like I'm getting paid
or anything like that.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.360
Then you have money for the whole fun...

31:43.361 --> 31:44.528
You could be out
playing golf or something.

31:44.529 --> 31:45.612
I love golf.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.072
You know, the thing is

know what they're talking about.

31:49.158 --> 31:50.367
Well, you're the first guy who gets it.

Well, I want you to know
I appreciate what you do.

- You're doing a hell of a job.
- Well, thank you.

31:53.538 --> 31:54.955
- Can I mention one thing?
- Yeah.

31:54.956 --> 31:58.083
I think you wanna think about maybe
a multiple set, pro-style offense.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.251
- Multiple set.
- Yeah.

31:59.252 --> 32:02.379
I got four kids out here who couldn't
identify their parents in a lineup.

32:02.380 --> 32:04.422
I understand that.
That's why I think if you put Zack in...

32:04.423 --> 32:06.550
- Zack? Who's Zack? Who's Zack?
- Well, Zack's my kid.

32:06.551 --> 32:09.219
Oh, Zack's your kid. Okay. All right.
That's it! I've had it.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.595
- Here you go, Lombardi.
- Whoa. Hold on. Wait.

- Hi.
- Hi.

32:23.776 --> 32:24.985
- What are you doing?
- Hi, Daddy.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.195
- Dad's cooking dinner.
- Spaghetti?

32:27.196 --> 32:29.740
Yeah, spaghetti. Just like the old days.

32:30.241 --> 32:34.161
Dad's the new football coach.
He's great. We scored!

32:34.704 --> 32:35.705
Really?

32:36.455 --> 32:37.998
We've got a good team.
We're gonna be all right.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.958
Hey, Zack.
You and your sister go upstairs

32:39.959 --> 32:41.376
and get washed up for dinner, all right?

32:41.377 --> 32:43.004
- ZACK: Okay.
- Come on, come on. Let's go.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.256
Yeah. Thanks. Good, good. Got going.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.301
- Thanks for coaching, Dad.
- You got it, man.

32:49.343 --> 32:53.306
So, how did you manage all this?
I thought you had a lot of extra work.

32:53.806 --> 32:54.890
Not anymore.

32:55.933 --> 32:56.976
Did you get fired?

32:57.310 --> 32:59.353
No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.521
I just got really tired

33:01.522 --> 33:03.815
of carrying that heavy load
around all the time, you know.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.734
So I just walked
right into King's office and I said,

33:05.735 --> 33:09.572
"Hey, look. You either get me some help
or I'm walking." You know?

33:10.072 --> 33:13.659
- Take a taste.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm. What did he say?

33:14.744 --> 33:15.828
What do you think he said?

33:17.163 --> 33:19.873
I thought the guy was going to cry,
really, it was pitiful.

33:19.874 --> 33:23.293
So anyway, he agreed to give me
somebody to help out, you know.

33:23.294 --> 33:25.421
That's that.
The guy's like an assistant.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.298
I'm glad. Who?

33:27.882 --> 33:29.300
- Huh?
- Who?

33:30.468 --> 33:34.929
Who? You mean, like, who's the guy?
Oh, he's just a, you know, a guy.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.600
A new guy. A new guy you don't know.
Very new guy.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.060
Really new guy you don't know.

33:40.144 --> 33:42.104
- So, what you're saying is, he's new?
- Yeah.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.815
But he's going
to run everything for me, so...

33:45.441 --> 33:47.400
- And you trust him?
- Oh, yeah.

33:47.401 --> 33:50.196
Yeah, I trust him. I trust him
like I trust myself, really.

33:51.113 --> 33:53.032
Wow, that's great.
So what are you gonna do now?

33:53.866 --> 33:56.535
Now? I don't know.

33:58.120 --> 34:01.874
Right now I thought I might, uh...
I might do this.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.005
I want you to take that new job.

34:10.007 --> 34:11.175
- My job?
- Your job.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.592
- Really? You mean it?
- Absolutely. Yep.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.928
Yes! Yes!

34:14.929 --> 34:16.888
That's great. That's great.
All right. All right.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.806
You know what? Valerie said,

34:18.808 --> 34:20.725
that I can come in
after I drop the kids off at school,

34:20.726 --> 34:22.476
and I can leave by 3:00.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.021
So if you could just
back me up occasionally.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.148
- No problem.
- Oh... (SIGHS)

Time? It's, uh... 5:30 in New York.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.649
That would make it 2:30 here.

35:20.369 --> 35:23.788
Okay, I'm not sure we really agreed
on a specific time.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.331
Yeah, we were. We were real specific.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.126
1:30. In fact, I repeated it twice.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.502

solid or laminate?

I've wanted to fire Vic?

too much of a wimp to do it.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.156
Yeah, but he has got, like,
34 kids, man.

36:40.157 --> 36:42.659
That's 'cause he's been married,
like, 17 times.

What have you got there?

36:44.537 --> 36:46.955

41:23.899 --> 41:25.234
I'm not getting any work done.

And all I do is, you know,
I cook and I do laundry.

41:29.446 --> 41:32.156
I pick up the kids
and drop off the kids,

41:32.157 --> 41:35.410
I dress the kids and undress the kids
and I clean up after them.

41:35.661 --> 41:38.038
I've done that for ten years.
You've been doing it for a month.

It comes more naturally to you.

How so?

Hon, you're a nurturer, you know?

You are. (STAMMERS) And first of all,

41:50.676 --> 41:54.179
you got the two X-chromosomes,
and I have a couple...

but it's scientifically proven.

Honey, that's why you have breasts.
I don't. Look at me.

42:01.103 --> 42:02.729
- I got nothing.
- Just what are you saying?

42:04.106 --> 42:07.943
Laura. This whole system isn't working.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.819
It's just not working.
It's a dismal failure.

42:09.820 --> 42:11.320
We have to go back to the way it worked.

42:11.321 --> 42:15.117
You stay and take care of the house,
which you do really well,

42:15.284 --> 42:17.161
and I... I have to do what I need to do.

42:18.245 --> 42:20.164
Oh. And what do you need to do?

42:21.039 --> 42:24.209
Laura, I have to go back to work.
And that's it.

42:27.629 --> 42:30.132
No, actually that's not it.

42:31.341 --> 42:34.677
I love my job,
and so far I'm doing great at it.

42:34.678 --> 42:37.972
In fact, Valerie said if I keep it up,
she's gonna move me into estates.

making a very good living.

that you've had, but I am not quitting.

to work all this out. And that is it.

It's so funny you think that's it.

42:59.161 --> 43:00.287
Because that's not it.

43:00.954 --> 43:03.039
The thing I said... That's it.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.334

43:06.084 --> 43:08.128
No, Doug. This is it.

I can't believe
you lured me here for this.

you have ever done.

43:27.147 --> 43:28.773

you were a happily married guy.

I had to do something. Look.

47:42.819 --> 47:45.613
I didn't know you felt that way.
We'll work all this out later.

47:45.614 --> 47:47.573
In the meantime, I'm gonna go out.
I'm gonna distract Laura.

That's not your sport coat, is it?

48:01.213 --> 48:03.547
Yeah. No, no, no, no.
I switched with a guy.

48:03.548 --> 48:04.965
I switched with a guy
in the men's room.

48:04.966 --> 48:06.217

We just traded.

- No, the pie here sucks. Let's go.

Oh, my God. It's your wife!

48:17.187 --> 48:18.480

to fight about that. That'd be dumb.

Aw, man. What do we need him for?

No, Douglas! No. I certainly did not.

56:39.772 --> 56:41.481
Look, here was the plan

56:41.482 --> 56:42.983
I thought, well,
we'll go to bed together,

56:42.984 --> 56:44.776
which we did,
and when she'd fall asleep,

56:44.777 --> 56:47.738

roll over and kind of brushed me
in that general region.

58:24.710 --> 58:27.713
Say, how about an
"I sailed with Walt" T-shirt, huh?

58:28.422 --> 58:29.923
No, thanks.

58:29.924 --> 58:31.383
You don't happen to have any of those,

58:31.384 --> 58:33.385
"I got a refund from
Walt" T-shirts, do you?

58:33.386 --> 58:34.553
No, sorry.

58:34.554 --> 58:35.555
Yeah, I didn't think so.

58:36.597 --> 58:39.850
Hey, (GRUNTS) I'd really like
to learn how to sail.

58:39.851 --> 58:42.352
Do you have anything big enough

58:42.353 --> 58:45.981
to take my whole family out
and not end up like Gilligan?

58:45.982 --> 58:47.900
(CHUCKLES)

58:48.067 --> 58:50.110
I love that show.

58:50.111 --> 58:52.904
Remember the one where they got
stranded with the Harlem Globetrotters?

58:52.905 --> 58:54.489
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

58:54.490 --> 58:56.408
Yeah. That was a good one.

58:56.409 --> 58:58.077
And... And believable too.

58:58.578 --> 59:01.247
<i>This is how we do it</i>

59:03.291 --> 59:05.333
<i>This is how we do it</i>

59:05.334 --> 59:07.878
<i>La ra ra ra ra ra</i>

59:07.879 --> 59:10.088

59:19.515 --> 59:21.683
<i>This is how we do it</i>

59:21.684 --> 59:23.810
<i>It's Friday night</i>

59:23.811 --> 59:26.229
<i>And I feel all right</i>

59:26.230 --> 59:28.773

59:28.774 --> 59:31.193
<i>I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because</i>

59:31.194 --> 59:33.153

59:33.154 --> 59:34.362
<i>South Central does it</i>

59:34.363 --> 59:35.780

59:35.781 --> 59:37.617
<i>This is how we do it</i>

59:37.867 --> 59:40.453

59:42.622 --> 59:44.122

59:45.958 --> 59:47.209
<i>This is how we do it</i>

59:47.210 --> 59:49.002
<i>If you were from</i>

59:49.003 --> 59:51.880
<i>Where I'm from then you would know</i>

59:51.881 --> 59:53.256
<i>- That I gotta get mine</i>
- Hi.

59:53.257 --> 59:54.549
<i>In a big black truck</i>

59:54.550 --> 59:56.593
<i>You can get yours in a '64</i>

<i>So tip up your cup

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.852
<i>And let me hear the party say</i>

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.647

(MUSIC STOPS)

01:00:13.945 --> 01:00:15.403
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.614
Jeez, Louise.

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.782
How many of you are there?

01:00:18.783 --> 01:00:19.951
That's... Hi, Doug.

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:22.786
Doug. That's our brother, Doug.

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:24.454
And that is Patti and Beth,

01:00:24.455 --> 01:00:25.747
and these are two girls, Patti and Beth.

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:27.833
And that's Doug.
Hi, Doug. We were just dancing.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:30.543
Ooh.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.672
One's cuter than the next. (LAUGHS)

01:00:34.257 --> 01:00:37.093
Are you as much fun as Lance and Rico?

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:40.262
Lance and Ri...

01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:41.930
You're...

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:44.016
You're, uh...
You're Rico, I'm guessing.

01:00:44.934 --> 01:00:46.519
- Guess again, pal.
- Oh.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:49.563
(LAUGHING)

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:52.358
Even he can't tell them apart.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.319
Look, uh, girls,

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.531
can, uh, we have some privacy?

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.865
We have to have a family meeting, okay?

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.576
- (MOANING)
- Wait...

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:05.453
I thought we were gonna have a party.

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:07.580
- Wait a minute.
- Yeah. You're kidding, right?

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.291
No. No, I'm serious.
Maybe some other time.

01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:11.167
- Nice buzz kill.
- My God.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.044
- Are you a drag or what?
- Well, I don't know.

01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:15.630
But, look, hey, try to keep your
voices down when you go out there,

01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:16.756
all right, please?

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:17.924
- It's important. Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:19.802
BOTH: (LOUDLY)
Goodnight, Lance! Goodnight, Rico!

01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:21.803
(LAUGHS) Nice.

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:22.805
Thanks. What?

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.934
The adventures of Lance and Rico.

01:01:28.769 --> 01:01:33.148
So, uh, Lance, where did you
meet those bimbs, anyway?

01:01:33.149 --> 01:01:35.525
They're the microwave
girls down at the AMPM Minimart.

01:01:35.526 --> 01:01:38.361
Yeah, they work down
at the store. They're clerks.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.363
(SCOFFS)

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:41.073
Well...

01:01:42.033 --> 01:01:43.117
Slurpee girls were busy, I guess.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.995
Look, I stopped down
to pick up my dinner.

01:01:46.996 --> 01:01:48.205
Like I always do.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.458
She offered to, uh,

01:01:51.459 --> 01:01:53.668
you know, nuke my corn dog.

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:54.879
What am I gonna say, no?

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.214
So, we came back here
and had ourselves a party.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:01.634
Doug, they actually happened
to be two very nice young women.

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.679
Yeah, "women" being
the key word here, Dougie.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.348
Yeah, right.

01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:08.183
Look, you can't just go out

01:02:08.184 --> 01:02:10.186
and meet some strangers
and bring them up here.

01:02:10.478 --> 01:02:12.521
Hey, what are we supposed to live like?
A couple of monks?

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:14.105
He makes a very good point, Doug.

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:15.107
Yeah.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:16.859
A damn good point.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:22.782
What are you doing?

01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:25.785
What do you mean, what am I doing?

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:28.495
I'm splitting atoms.

01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:29.747
I'm having a smoke. What's it look like?

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.083
Yeah, I can see you're having a smoke
but what the hell for?

01:02:32.333 --> 01:02:33.709
- What's it to you?
- What's it to me?

01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:36.212
I spent $1,000 to quit. Remember?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.255
- That's what it is.
- (BLOWS)

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:42.634
(COUGHING)

01:02:42.635 --> 01:02:44.136
Looks like it didn't take.

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.306
Don't ever blow smoke in my face again.

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:50.517
(SCOFFS) What are you gonna do about it?

01:02:50.518 --> 01:02:51.601
What am I gonna do about it?

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.353
I'll hit you so hard, I'll kill him.

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:55.939
Guys, guys, come on. Come on, guys.
We gotta sit down

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.649
and have a rap session or something.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.234
Because you're both feeling
a lot of anger here...

01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:01.654
I'm just afraid, you know,
you're like two lions or something.

01:03:01.904 --> 01:03:03.656
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

01:03:03.823 --> 01:03:05.032
I'm sorry.

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:06.742
Oh, man. Where's your aspirin?

01:03:06.909 --> 01:03:09.119
Tylenol, Doug.
It's less abrasive on the stomach.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.913
It's in the kitchen,
above the cabinet...

01:03:11.414 --> 01:03:12.832
Yeah. Yeah, I'll find it.

01:03:13.416 --> 01:03:15.083
Guys, look at this place.
Look at this place. It's a mess.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:16.752
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.797
(CRASHING)

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:28.889
One, two, three, four.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:30.516
Doug, if I might...

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:31.725
No, wait.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.939
One, two, three...

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.941
Uh-huh.

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:43.070
Four...

01:03:43.904 --> 01:03:46.156
- Twelve!
- (LAUGHS)

01:03:46.157 --> 01:03:47.240
Seven.

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:49.118
Doug, I'd like you to meet Four.

01:03:50.828 --> 01:03:53.956
I got a wallet. That guy gave it to me.

01:03:57.751 --> 01:03:59.044
I'm gonna drive a car.

01:04:01.255 --> 01:04:02.840
He's got a wallet.

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.551
Come here. Come here.

01:04:07.386 --> 01:04:09.220
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.514
Where did he come from?

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.640
He's gonna help us out around here
a little bit. Just, you know...

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:15.351
Yeah, do the day-to-day stuff.
Clean the house,

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.853
mow the lawn, take out the trash.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.438
All the bullshit
we don't have time to do.

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:20.649
Forget that! Forget that!

01:04:22.151 --> 01:04:23.443
What the hell is wrong with him?

01:04:23.444 --> 01:04:24.445
Ow!

01:04:25.404 --> 01:04:26.780
Nothing.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.283
You know, nothing really wrong.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:32.828
You know, he's, uh,
he's a little special.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.080
TWO: He's fine. He'll be all right.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.042
Yeah, he's special, all right.

01:04:39.043 --> 01:04:40.627
Doug, see what we did was,

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:42.504
we made a copy from Two.

01:04:42.505 --> 01:04:45.089
You know how sometimes
you make a copy of a copy

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.300
it's not quite as sharp as,
well, the original.

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:49.219
Well, that's kind of what happened.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.347
Leeds loved it, he loved it,
because it was very experimental.

01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:54.808
And we got a great deal on it too.
Very cheap.

01:04:55.226 --> 01:04:56.352
(OBJECTS CLATTERING)

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:58.478
Leeds loved it, huh?

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:00.898
Good. I'm glad Leeds loved it.
Because I hate it.

01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:05.152
You can't just go around cloning people.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:07.196
That's... That's crazy!

01:05:08.781 --> 01:05:10.783
Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:15.703
All right. Listen up.
Listen really clearly to me.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:19.457
Rule number two. First of all...

01:05:19.458 --> 01:05:21.043
We all remember rule number one.

01:05:21.377 --> 01:05:23.002
BOTH: No sleeping with your wife.

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:24.588
It's in here. I got it.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:26.423
All right, all right. That's important.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:31.220
Rule number two.
No more Dougs. That's it.

01:05:31.512 --> 01:05:33.054
This is plenty, I think.

01:05:33.055 --> 01:05:34.598
I'm gonna call Leeds first
thing in the morning.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:37.684
We're out of the Doug-making
business altogether, all right?

01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:39.602
Store's closed.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.438
- Am I clear? Am I clear on this?
- Yeah! Yeah.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.775
- Got it.
- Book is closed on that one.

01:05:47.695 --> 01:05:48.696
Oh, man.

01:05:53.242 --> 01:05:54.577
I like pizza.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.704
I like it!

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.081
We're gonna need a cage.

01:06:02.251 --> 01:06:03.335
Bye, Steve.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:05.462
Good party.

01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:12.428
I like Steve.

01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:20.810
Well, how did it go?

01:06:20.811 --> 01:06:23.438
Oh, man. I'm telling you, this is great!

01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:25.231
He was fantastic.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:26.774
You want some really great sailing?

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:28.484
You know what you ought to do?
Grab Mrs. Doug,

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.320
get her down here tomorrow morning,

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:32.697
and come to Catalina with Robin
and me on my big boat.

01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:34.866
You should think about it.
I think you'd like it.

01:06:34.867 --> 01:06:36.534
Oh, I'm telling you,

01:06:36.535 --> 01:06:39.037
we cruise into Avalon Harbor at sunset

01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:41.164
Couple of bottles of champagne onboard.

01:06:41.165 --> 01:06:44.167
We'd leave you alone.
You make love right on the boat.

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:45.543
Walt.

01:06:45.544 --> 01:06:48.046
- Most romantic thing in the world.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:50.090
Think about Catalina.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:52.384
Yeah. Maybe. I'll call you.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:07:00.016
Honey, may I do that? Do you mind?

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.101
- This?
- Yeah. I just wanna show you something.

01:07:02.102 --> 01:07:04.104
See. First of all,

01:07:04.897 --> 01:07:07.857
this piece of aluminum foil
is too small.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.234
See? It can't cover it all,
what's gonna happen?

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:11.694
Air's going to get in there,

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:14.113
and then you get that little
hard crust around the meat.

01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.158
It gets real brown and dark
and nobody wants to eat that.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:18.284
So, I'm gonna fold this up
and I'm gonna save this.

01:07:18.285 --> 01:07:19.577
We can use it later.

01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:20.912
Or, Christmastime comes around,

01:07:20.913 --> 01:07:23.164
we might make ourselves a nice
ornament outta that or something.

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:24.582
That's what I like to do.

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.960
And by the way, save those fries.
'Cause I'm thinking of stringing them,

01:07:27.336 --> 01:07:29.338
and we'll paint them up or something,
we'll just string them around the tree.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:32.048
Christmas time.
Kids are gonna love that. Okay, now.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:35.010
Here, look here.
Okay, we'll take a new, fresh piece.

01:07:38.305 --> 01:07:41.057
Okay. Now I'm gonna
fold it up on one side, like that.

01:07:41.058 --> 01:07:42.392
Make sure we're even.

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:45.687
And then I fold once, I fold twice,

01:07:45.688 --> 01:07:47.271
or three times.
Whatever you need to fold it.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:49.482
But I don't like to roll it.
Sometimes people just roll it over,

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:51.150
but I don't like that because
then you get that lump

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:53.194
right across the center, roll around
in the fridge and everything.

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:55.738
I like to fold it down so it's nice
and flat, and no air gets in there.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.324
Because what?
Air is our enemy, isn't it?

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:59.368
And then...

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.830
Then take this. Tuck, tuck, fold.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.707
T.T.F. Tuck, tuck, fold.

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:08.168
Two tucks and a fold.
I just think of Elizabeth Taylor.

01:08:08.419 --> 01:08:10.878
Then I was remembering tuck here,
fold there, you know, makes it simple.

01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:13.549
Okay, now roll it over, nice and flat.
There we go.

01:08:14.049 --> 01:08:16.343
We got it. No air is gonna get in there.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.638
We could send this little guy off
to NASA and nothing would happen.

01:08:20.639 --> 01:08:24.225
Look here. Okay, now put the lid on,
burp. There you go. There.

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:28.438
That's very nice. It's very nice.

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:31.692
Doug, I've been noticing
some things about you lately,

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:34.862
and I'm starting to think that maybe...

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.116
What?

01:08:39.408 --> 01:08:40.658
Nothing.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:42.953
Go like this.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.790
Go...

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:51.919
Can I just do something?

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.921
There...

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:54.715
There.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:58.259
See? See what that does?
That just frames you better,

01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:01.513
it kind of...
And here it gives you, um, height.

01:09:03.599 --> 01:09:07.018
Honey, why don't you just go relax

01:09:07.019 --> 01:09:08.562
and let me finish cleaning up?

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.274
Why?

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.861
Okay. All right. You sure?

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:18.237
I'm sure.

01:09:18.238 --> 01:09:19.363
Okay.

01:09:20.866 --> 01:09:21.867
Freezer.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.787
Second shelf. Over the left.
With all the other meat products.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:27.788
Unless it's in a skin casing,
like your franks

01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:29.832
and your sausages and kielbasas...

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.002
Then it goes lower... In the bin.

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.440
Oh, boy! Man!

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:55.692
That was a great meal, honey.

01:09:55.943 --> 01:09:57.110
Great meal.

01:09:58.529 --> 01:09:59.738
You cooked it.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.075
Yeah, but, you know, you ate it.

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:08.956
Doug, were you wearing
that shirt earlier?

01:10:09.665 --> 01:10:11.833
This? Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:10:11.834 --> 01:10:13.293
I'm losing it.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:16.171
Dad, watch this.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:20.425
Wow! Great. Hey, let me show you
how to walk the dog.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.512
You just showed me before dinner.

01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:26.222
I did?

01:10:26.223 --> 01:10:28.892
Oh, right. That's right.
I did. I forgot.

01:10:29.643 --> 01:10:31.395
Hey, you guys, wanna go
and get some ice cream?

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:35.107
Unless we...
Unless we already did.

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.529
LAURA: Doug, did you decide?

01:10:41.405 --> 01:10:42.698
(BRUSHING TEETH) Did I decide what?

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.534
What we've been talking
about all evening.

01:10:46.535 --> 01:10:48.537
You said you would think about it
and let me know.

01:10:49.997 --> 01:10:51.289
I did.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:53.709
I gave it a lot of thought.
I thought about it a lot, babe.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.627
What did you think?

01:10:56.628 --> 01:10:59.213
Well, you know...

01:10:59.214 --> 01:11:01.591
I've been thinking about it.
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:11:01.592 --> 01:11:02.925
I gave it a lot of thought.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:06.429
I think whatever you think we should do
is probably the smartest thing to do.

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.223
You know, you're smart.
You have great ideas.

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.141
Oh, please, honey.

01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:12.352
Don't put this all on me.
They're your kids, too.

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.773
Can I... Can I say something?

01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:19.443
I really think we ought to leave
the kids out of this, hon.

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:22.612
What do you mean?

01:11:22.613 --> 01:11:25.073
You wanna go to Disney World
without the kids?

01:11:25.866 --> 01:11:28.951
No. No. Uh-uh.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.078
No. That's...
I certainly don't wanna do that.

01:11:31.079 --> 01:11:32.873
I don't want to do that.
That's not fair to the kids.

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:35.875
To go all the way down there,
just you and me riding those rides.

01:11:35.876 --> 01:11:38.002
It's stupid. Can I ask you something?

01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:40.255
When is it we're going
to Disney World again?

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.214
Christmas.

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:44.343
I bought non-refundable tickets
to Orlando.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:47.011
You bought non-refundable
tickets to Orlando?

01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:48.180
Are you nuts?

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.014
You told me to go ahead and buy them.

01:11:50.015 --> 01:11:51.599
- Not me.
- Then who?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.852
Not me. Not me.

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:57.189
(SIGHS) God, Doug,
you're driving me crazy!

01:11:57.356 --> 01:12:00.066
I call the office
and you bite my head off.

01:12:00.067 --> 01:12:02.360
Other times you're as sweet as can be.

01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:04.528
And then one minute
you're obsessing about

01:12:04.529 --> 01:12:05.864
every little detail.

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:08.116
And then the next you seem
so completely out of it,

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:10.368
like you don't even know
what I'm talking about.

01:12:10.369 --> 01:12:12.412
What is going on with you?

01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:14.163
Nothing. Nothing's wrong with me.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:16.290
Absolutely nothing's wrong with me.

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:17.459
Oh, my God, Doug.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:19.877
You could have bipolar disorder

01:12:19.878 --> 01:12:22.255
or multiple personalities.

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:26.884
- Hon, let's sail to Catalina.
- What?

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:28.386
Come on, it'll be great.

01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:30.262
We'll sail right into
the harbor at sunset.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.473
We'll bring some wine,
we'll make love right on the boat.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:34.767
- It'll be great.
- Doug, you don't sail.

01:12:34.768 --> 01:12:37.269
But I drink and make love.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.313
The sailing thing, you know,
I can figure that out.

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:40.815
How hard can it be?

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:42.733
We can't just go sailing off
to Catalina.

01:12:42.734 --> 01:12:45.319
Why not? Let's just be spontaneous!

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.862
We'll leave the kids with your parents.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.115
We used to do stuff like this.
Let's go...

01:12:49.116 --> 01:12:52.243
You're the one who says,
"Let's go down to, you know, Ecuador

01:12:52.244 --> 01:12:55.329
"and, you know, throw harpoons
with Peruvian basket people and stuff."

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:57.456
Yeah, but that's just talk.

01:12:57.457 --> 01:12:59.834
Well, let's do it. Let's just go.
Why can't we?

01:12:59.835 --> 01:13:01.544
- Why not? Why can't we?
- Why not?

01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:04.046
- Yeah.
- Your job. My job.

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:05.631
Jennifer's dance recital.

01:13:05.632 --> 01:13:07.134
The Donaldsons' anniversary party.

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:09.385
Oh, I'm not going to the Donaldsons'
anniversary party.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:10.594
- You said you were.
- When?

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:11.971
Just this morning!

01:13:11.972 --> 01:13:13.973
When you figure out what you want,

01:13:13.974 --> 01:13:16.059
would you just let me know?

Can I...
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:54.890
Sure, Doug.

01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:58.976
What's up, Doug? Everything okay?

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:00.519
I've got to go away
for a couple of days.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.188
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a business trip.

01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:04.148
- Business trip?
- Business trip?

01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:05.733
- Hi, Steve.
- I handle the business.

01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:06.943
Yeah, he handles the business, Steve.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:10.654
Okay, fine. It's not a business trip.

01:14:10.655 --> 01:14:12.531
Look, I just need to get away by myself

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:14.658
and, you know, figure some things out.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.035
Do you understand?

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:18.370
You need to get centered. I understand.

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.289
Good idea. Good for you.
You deserve that.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:22.875
Thank you. I need to get centered,
right. Anyway...

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:24.669
I need you to cover for me
days and nights.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.505
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Nights?
- Whoa!

What about rule number one?

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.092
Yeah, what about rule number one, Steve?

01:14:31.093 --> 01:14:33.385
- What's rule number one?
- Hey, uh...

Rain Man, run back in there

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:37.015
and floss yourself, buddy, all right?

01:14:39.351 --> 01:14:40.726
I already thought of that.
I already thought of that.

01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:42.061
Rule number one still stands.

when I had that bronchial infection?

- Oh, sure. That's nasty.
- Well, you got it again.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:49.568
Okay? Just cough a lot.
Tell her you're really, really sick

01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:51.195
and you don't want her
to catch it, okay?

01:14:51.196 --> 01:14:53.365
And keep your distance.
Can you handle that?

01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:55.951
Yeah. I got a sore throat and a fever.
Okay, uh-huh.

Hey, Doug. Do you want me to handle it?

01:14:58.537 --> 01:14:59.996
No. Thanks, though.

Where's your wife?

01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:41.037
Oh. She couldn't make it.

01:15:41.454 --> 01:15:43.373
Well, don't you wanna wait
until she can come with you?

01:15:43.832 --> 01:15:44.833
Uh...

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.211
No, you know what,
she'll probably come next time.

01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:50.629
- All right, then. Come on aboard.
- All right, great.

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.465

(COUGHING)

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:58.072
I'm sorry about last night.

01:16:58.073 --> 01:17:00.992
I understand why you
wanted us to go away together.

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:06.205
It did sound romantic,

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:08.500
but we don't have
to go away to make love.

Well, no.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.300
I think I'm really coming down
with something here.

'Cause I've got a lot of phlegm,

Oh, gee! I'm burning up.

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:27.685
I think I've come up
with a fever or something.

if we don't get too close tonight.

I was just moved by it all.

just under the weather, here.

01:26:54.794 --> 01:26:56.628
I mean, can't you get
someone else meet him?

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.380
Nobody knows this job like you do.

01:26:58.381 --> 01:27:01.299
Look, you stop screwing around,
get your ass down there,

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:03.427
or start looking for another job!

01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:06.806
Nice attitude, Del.

01:27:07.807 --> 01:27:08.890
(SIGHS)

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:09.975
He said...

01:27:09.976 --> 01:27:13.061
Yeah, yeah, I heard him.
I gotta get down there.

01:27:13.062 --> 01:27:14.855
- You can't go.
- I gotta go.

01:27:14.856 --> 01:27:16.816
- You can't go
- I gotta go.

01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:20.569
Well, maybe I'll just lie down for a...

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:22.028
You're not going anywhere.

01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:24.532
Four, take care of him.
I'm going to work.

01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:30.453
(SIGHS) Sorry, Steve.

01:27:30.454 --> 01:27:32.290
That leg's gonna have to come off.

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:35.585
TWO: All right. So,

01:27:36.377 --> 01:27:38.837
these are the water pipes.

01:27:38.838 --> 01:27:41.798
And you've got hot and cold

01:27:41.799 --> 01:27:44.009
both available in all the units.

01:27:44.010 --> 01:27:46.596
Which is really, you know, really nice.

01:27:46.846 --> 01:27:48.722
What is this? This looks like...

01:27:48.723 --> 01:27:50.724
And it is. It's the gas line.

01:27:50.725 --> 01:27:52.142
That's gonna be your gas line...

01:27:52.143 --> 01:27:56.022
Which would feed natural gas
to all the appliances,

01:27:56.272 --> 01:27:58.273
which would require,

01:27:58.274 --> 01:27:59.775
you know, natural gas.

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.612
- Doug...
- Huh?

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:05.780
You're not answering
the inspector's question.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:08.408
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
What was the question?

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:10.702
The plan showed two-inch gas lines...

01:28:10.703 --> 01:28:13.413
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go like this. Go... (SUCKS TEETH)

01:28:13.414 --> 01:28:14.916
Right here. You've got something...

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.417
That's it. You got it. You had
a little something right there...

01:28:17.418 --> 01:28:20.463
Uh... (SCOFFS) I wanna
know why you only went with one-inch?

01:28:21.005 --> 01:28:23.048
Oh, that's right. That's right.

01:28:23.049 --> 01:28:25.301
That's right. I remember. I remember.

01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:30.139
So, what's the answer?

01:28:32.642 --> 01:28:34.310
Can you excuse me for a second?

01:28:35.937 --> 01:28:37.146
(PHONE RINGING)

01:28:39.273 --> 01:28:40.274
What?

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:42.776
Hi. Hey, why did you
decide to use one-inch gas lines...

01:28:42.777 --> 01:28:44.569
- (BANGING)
<i>- ...instead of two?</i>

01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:46.197
'Cause... Knock it off!

01:28:51.619 --> 01:28:54.996
Because the original calcs
were based on kitchens with two ovens.

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:56.873
King cut it back to one to save money.

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:58.167
(BANGING CONTINUES)

01:29:18.813 --> 01:29:20.481
Got it. I remember.

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.107
I remember now what it was.

01:29:22.108 --> 01:29:24.275
The original plans called for two ovens.

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.946
Somebody decided
to cut back to just the one.

01:29:27.238 --> 01:29:28.738
To save money, I guess.

01:29:28.739 --> 01:29:30.616
Anyway, I don't know about you, fellas,

01:29:31.075 --> 01:29:32.659
but I personally like a double oven.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.661
Sure, there's a lot
of bending, there is,

01:29:34.662 --> 01:29:36.705
but, you know, if you got
a turkey in the bottom, or something

01:29:36.706 --> 01:29:38.873
and maybe some rutabaga
or something, I don't know,

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:40.917
anything... Anything cooking up top,

01:29:40.918 --> 01:29:43.044
it's nice. It's nice
if you like to entertain which I do.

01:29:43.045 --> 01:29:45.505
Yeah, but you're still
stubbed out for two.

01:29:45.506 --> 01:29:47.048
Now, what if someone future occupant

01:29:47.049 --> 01:29:48.509
decides to put in a second oven?

01:29:49.385 --> 01:29:50.510
Well...

01:29:50.511 --> 01:29:51.970
(WORKERS TALKING
INDISTINCTLY IN THE DISTANCE)

01:29:51.971 --> 01:29:53.513
Ya, hit me. (CHUCKLES)

01:29:53.514 --> 01:29:54.890
I don't know.

01:29:56.392 --> 01:29:57.393
Hold on a second.

01:29:57.685 --> 01:29:59.311
This is ridiculous.

01:30:00.146 --> 01:30:02.230
No. Wait... Wait...

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:05.191
The guy can't answer
a few simple questions about a job?

01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:07.527
I mean, running off into another room
every two minutes?

01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:09.362
You know what that usually means?

01:30:09.363 --> 01:30:10.697
Alcohol and drugs.

01:30:10.698 --> 01:30:12.574
I mean, God knows
what he's been doing on the job here.

01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:14.534
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

01:30:14.535 --> 01:30:16.619
Here's how it works.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.371
Even with the extra demand of the oven,

01:30:18.372 --> 01:30:20.041
we took the laundry rooms off this line

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:22.500
and we ran a separate
line down the back.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.754
So, which line is feeding
the gas fireplaces now?

01:30:26.714 --> 01:30:29.091
Thinking. Thinking.

01:30:30.176 --> 01:30:31.719
Boy, does he have some tough ones.

01:30:32.053 --> 01:30:34.471
Oh, that's it. This guy
doesn't know what he's doing.

01:30:34.472 --> 01:30:36.639
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.475
Wait a second there, mister.

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:41.436
I mean, certainly,
you're entitled to your opinion.

01:30:41.437 --> 01:30:43.229
But, I don't think
it's fair to judge anyone

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:46.191
based on one
very, very superficial conversation.

01:30:46.192 --> 01:30:47.193
Do you, Del?

01:30:48.486 --> 01:30:50.820
I'm gonna find the building commissioner
to re-inspect everything.

01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:53.074
- No!
- Kinney. Doug Kinney.

01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:57.660
You, will stop all work
right where it is until further notice.

01:30:57.661 --> 01:31:00.164
I'll be back in about three weeks.

01:31:00.498 --> 01:31:02.499
And I suggest, you get your act together

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.000
if you wanna keep your license.

01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:07.755
- Three weeks?
- And get that man some help.

01:31:08.923 --> 01:31:10.507
You what?

01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:11.926
You got fired?

01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:15.012
Oh, man... How... How...

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:19.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:21.435
Just... Just come home.

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:24.021
Oh, man.

01:31:33.114 --> 01:31:34.490
Oh, man.

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.286
(EXHALES)

01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:45.209
Doug, what are you doing home?

01:31:46.544 --> 01:31:47.919
Are you sick?

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.131
Yeah. We got any Pepto-Bismol?

01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:53.883
What about your big inspection?

01:31:53.884 --> 01:31:55.552
(SCOFFS) My big inspection...

01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:57.805
Well, I guess I missed it, didn't I?

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:00.890
What... I thought it was so important.

01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:03.059
I rearranged everything so you could go.

01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.602
So, Laura, you know...

01:32:04.603 --> 01:32:06.271
What are you, some kind of saint?

01:32:06.272 --> 01:32:08.065
I mean, what do you want me to do?
Give you a medal?

01:32:15.823 --> 01:32:17.658
That makes me feel better.

01:32:26.917 --> 01:32:28.210
Doug,

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:32.755
I guess you've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:34.632
But when you talk to me like that,

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:35.884
I think you mean it.

01:32:35.885 --> 01:32:37.595
And it hurts me.

01:32:38.721 --> 01:32:41.055
Now, something is happening lately.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:44.601
(STAMMERS) And I feel like
I don't know you anymore.

01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:46.437
And it scares me, Doug.

01:32:47.688 --> 01:32:51.274
You know, you go along, day after day,

01:32:51.275 --> 01:32:54.444
and you tell yourself
that your problems aren't serious.

01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:55.904
They're normal.

01:32:55.905 --> 01:32:57.822
You know, they...
They happen to everyone.

01:32:57.823 --> 01:33:00.617
Or you hope that they'll just
go away by themselves,

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:01.911
but they don't.

01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:05.956
It's like this house.

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:09.752
You always said you would fix it up.

01:33:11.045 --> 01:33:12.212
No matter what it was,

01:33:12.213 --> 01:33:13.923
"I'll fix it," you said.

01:33:14.465 --> 01:33:16.550
But nothing ever gets fixed.

01:33:19.511 --> 01:33:20.512
Doug.

01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:24.391
I need to know what you're feeling.

01:33:26.894 --> 01:33:29.355
I need to know if you still love me.

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:35.151
Doug, please just...

01:33:35.152 --> 01:33:36.528
Tell me what you want.

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:41.450
I want pizza.

01:33:46.163 --> 01:33:47.373
What?

01:33:51.085 --> 01:33:52.503
I want pizza.

01:33:53.963 --> 01:33:55.464
Give me some pizza.

Yeah, not too much chance of that...

What're you talking about? Where is she?

01:34:35.796 --> 01:34:37.047
She left you.

Yeah, nothing but tail lights.

I'm sorry. She took the kids

and went to her mother's.

01:36:28.117 --> 01:36:29.284
She did, Doug.

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:32.121
The fact is...

01:36:34.706 --> 01:36:36.333
She thought I was you, too.

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:37.835

One really bad day.

01:37:08.449 --> 01:37:09.740
We tried, Doug.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.576
We really did. It was a nightmare.

01:37:11.577 --> 01:37:13.703
She was unstoppable, Doug.
It was unbelievable.

01:37:13.704 --> 01:37:15.581

01:37:47.613 --> 01:37:48.780
Why did she leave?

Did she tell you something?

01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:59.017

She cried, because...

01:39:09.903 --> 01:39:11.446

See?

01:47:05.712 --> 01:47:07.464
This is perfect.

01:47:10.425 --> 01:47:11.842
Great, right?

01:47:11.843 --> 01:47:12.969
Oh, gosh.

01:47:14.304 --> 01:47:17.264
- Oh... The wall's gone.
- Yeah.

01:47:17.265 --> 01:47:19.434
Oh, it's just like I dreamed, it's...

01:47:20.727 --> 01:47:22.603
Oh, Doug!

01:47:22.604 --> 01:47:24.314
I'm so glad you like it.

01:47:30.862 --> 01:47:31.863
(GASPS)

01:47:40.914 --> 01:47:42.957
LAURA: It's so pretty.

01:47:47.504 --> 01:47:48.880
How did you do this?

01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:52.132
Well, I had...

01:47:52.133 --> 01:47:55.260
Had some of the boys pitch in
and help me out, you know.

01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:58.264
Got some of the guys to do some work,
and just got it done.

01:47:59.265 --> 01:48:00.599
You know, if you put your mind to it,

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.227
I think you can do anything.

01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:14.614
(SIGHS)

01:48:24.207 --> 01:48:25.750
So, what do you think?

01:48:27.836 --> 01:48:29.629
I think it's a miracle.

01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:33.841
It's good, right? I told you.
I told you I'd finish it.

01:48:33.842 --> 01:48:36.386
I just, you know...
I just needed time to get it done.

01:48:37.637 --> 01:48:38.804
Hey, you know what I'm thinking of?

01:48:38.805 --> 01:48:41.723
I'm thinking of starting
my own contracting business.

01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:43.143
What do you think?

01:48:43.518 --> 01:48:46.062
You see, that way I could
set my own hours,

01:48:46.312 --> 01:48:47.605
and kind of pace myself.

01:48:47.897 --> 01:48:49.731
I mean, I don't wanna do anything big.

01:48:49.732 --> 01:48:53.528
I'm gonna start off with,
uh, you know, small jobs.

01:48:54.654 --> 01:48:57.490
Bird houses and, you know, mail boxes.

01:48:57.907 --> 01:48:59.117
Stuff like that.

01:49:02.203 --> 01:49:03.621
That'd be nice.

01:49:07.333 --> 01:49:08.334
Man...

01:49:12.755 --> 01:49:14.299
I love you so much.

01:49:21.556 --> 01:49:23.433
I mean, I just, like...

01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:28.980
I just really love you.

01:49:32.567 --> 01:49:33.902
Whatever I do,

01:49:35.361 --> 01:49:36.613
whatever you need to do...

01:49:40.074 --> 01:49:42.243
As long as we're both rowing
the same boat, right?

01:49:43.369 --> 01:49:45.037
We'll be fine. Don't you think?

01:49:45.038 --> 01:49:46.747
Yeah, I think.

01:49:46.748 --> 01:49:47.957
Yeah, me too.

01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:51.085
(SNIFFLES) Whoo... Okay.

01:50:02.931 --> 01:50:04.723
- LAURA: Bye, honey!
- JENNIFER: Bye, Daddy!

01:50:04.724 --> 01:50:06.809
- ZACK: Bye, Dad.
- DOUG: Bye! See you.

01:50:11.064 --> 01:50:12.357
Bye!

01:50:34.170 --> 01:50:37.923
So, where are you guys headed?

01:50:37.924 --> 01:50:40.217
Wherever the road takes us, Doug.

01:50:40.218 --> 01:50:42.469
I don't know. We're thinking about
maybe going down to Florida.

01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:44.471
Stop off in Vegas, of course.

01:50:44.472 --> 01:50:46.598
Yeah, and we're gonna eat a dolphin.

01:50:46.599 --> 01:50:49.434
Hey, Lenny.

01:50:49.435 --> 01:50:51.854
You're not gonna eat a dolphin, pal.
You're gonna pet one.

01:50:52.105 --> 01:50:53.982
LENNY: Oh, yeah, wait. That's right.

01:50:54.148 --> 01:50:56.651
We're gonna... We're gonna pet one.
We're gonna pet a dolphin.

01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:02.448
Are you gonna be all right?

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:07.287
Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna be all right.

01:51:07.704 --> 01:51:10.540
We're gonna be fine, Doug.
Don't worry about us.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.293
How about you?

01:51:14.127 --> 01:51:15.128
You gonna be all right?

01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:17.797
Yeah.

01:51:19.007 --> 01:51:20.425
Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

01:51:22.343 --> 01:51:23.636
Wow.

01:51:25.096 --> 01:51:26.848
Hey, I'll tell you one thing.

01:51:28.766 --> 01:51:30.476
You're three good-looking guys.

01:51:30.977 --> 01:51:32.687
(LAUGHS) Doug.

01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:36.023
- Thanks!
- When he's right, he's right.

01:51:36.024 --> 01:51:37.525
Well, I guess.

01:51:38.693 --> 01:51:40.445
- (SIGHS)
- Okay, man.

01:51:42.405 --> 01:51:43.740
I'll see ya.

01:51:44.991 --> 01:51:46.075
Bye, Doug.

01:51:46.993 --> 01:51:48.119
See you, Steve.

01:52:05.636 --> 01:52:09.098
ZACK: Mom, if a T-Rex
fought with a tank...

01:52:09.265 --> 01:52:10.724
Who do you think would win?

01:52:10.725 --> 01:52:12.769
I don't know, honey, I'm not really...

01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:17.357
Mom?

01:52:25.365 --> 01:52:27.616
You know how you can tell
when you really love someone?

01:52:27.617 --> 01:52:29.285
- How?
- JENNIFER: How?

01:52:29.869 --> 01:52:31.996
LAURA: When everyone you see
reminds you of him.

01:52:35.083 --> 01:52:38.086

01:52:54.268 --> 01:52:56.229
- Let's bump chests.

01:52:58.564 --> 01:53:00.233
<i>As for me,</i>

01:53:00.566 --> 01:53:02.610
<i>I am cooking up a storm
and having a ball.</i>

01:53:04.612 --> 01:53:06.655
<i>The pizzas are selling like crazy.</i>

01:53:06.656 --> 01:53:08.908

enough of my pepperoni.</i>

<i>He's working two jobs now,
and doing very well.</i>

01:53:19.919 --> 01:53:22.129
<i>In the morning, he delivers newspapers,</i>

01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:24.423
<i>and then the rest of the day
he delivers pizzas for us.</i>

01:53:24.424 --> 01:53:25.967

<i>We've got things to say</i>

01:53:46.028 --> 01:53:48.572
<i>Talk out! Let's have a talk</i>

01:53:48.573 --> 01:53:51.700
<i>And things will be okay</i>
