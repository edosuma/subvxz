WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:10.843
Hey, look who I drug out.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.595
[chuckles] Oh, shit.

00:14.556 --> 00:17.017
And it's after 7:00.
It's not even your birthday.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.936
Wait, it's not your birthday, is it?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.564
It's not his birthday.

00:23.898 --> 00:24.899
Is it?

00:26.484 --> 00:30.238
If it was my birthday, do you think
I'd be spending it with my sons?

00:31.864 --> 00:33.491
Hey, are you gonna
get us a couple beers,

00:33.575 --> 00:35.910
or am I gonna have to leave
another angry Yelp review?

00:36.703 --> 00:39.622
Yeah, sure.
Need to see your ID, please.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.003
-What?
-Dude, can't get shut down again.

00:46.088 --> 00:49.341
-[scoffs] I'm your brother.
-Yeah, that's what you would say.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.636
Plus, you look kind of like
a young girl. ID, please.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.139
All right.
Pay attention to my middle name.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.852
You're an organ donor?

01:02.395 --> 01:05.022
Shit. Some poor asshole's
gotta get stuck with your brain?

01:08.985 --> 01:10.278
Hey, Dad. Can I see your ID?

01:10.362 --> 01:11.363
Fuck you.

01:13.115 --> 01:14.366
Two beers. Coming up.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.578
All right. That'll be six bucks.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.663
Six bucks for beer?

01:20.747 --> 01:25.627
You owe me 50 grand for room and board
for the last 35 years.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.046
Come on, Dad.
You're complaining about six bucks?

01:29.131 --> 01:31.090
You're about to have
all that pipeline money coming through.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.218
Not till we sign the papers.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.762
Engineer Jen is coming
back to town next week,

01:35.845 --> 01:37.764
so we can talk some more about it.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.974
Really? Well, you let me know
when that is, all right?

01:40.057 --> 01:42.852
I've always wanted to know what it's like,
hooking up with a college graduate.

01:45.188 --> 01:47.690
I mean, there was that one time
I hooked up with that doctor.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.110
That was a Halloween costume.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.904
[both laugh]

01:52.987 --> 01:55.698
By that logic, I hooked up
with the back half of a unicorn.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.949
[all laugh]

01:57.742 --> 01:59.619
-Besides, you're with Mary.
-[chuckles]

01:59.702 --> 02:02.038
Nope. Not no more.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.791
What happened?
She meet anyone else?

02:04.874 --> 02:06.168
[chuckles]

02:07.127 --> 02:10.422
Had to cut her loose.
Time for this Rooster to fly.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.175
Time for this Django to be unchained.

02:15.092 --> 02:16.093
You doing all right?

02:16.178 --> 02:18.930
Of course I'm doing all right.
Rooster's back on the market.

02:19.013 --> 02:22.142
Today I signed up for Tinder,
Bumble and Farmers Only.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.771
[laughs] Check out my profile pic. Me...

02:26.854 --> 02:29.691
[both laugh]

02:29.774 --> 02:31.276
...shirtless at the lake,

02:31.359 --> 02:33.778
right before them rich guys threw me off
that big boat.

02:36.113 --> 02:39.534
[laughs] Your skin's so pink,
you look like a little piglet.

02:41.118 --> 02:43.288
Yeah, looks like a horse's ass to me.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.664
[both laugh]

02:45.457 --> 02:48.251
-Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.
-[Colt] Hey.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.254
Oh, teachers' meeting at school
took forever.

02:51.963 --> 02:52.964
[sighs]

02:53.047 --> 02:56.634
Apparently, our office pool picking
which student's gonna get pregnant next

02:56.718 --> 02:58.886
is a "lawsuit waitin' to happen."

03:00.513 --> 03:03.015
It's bullshit, too,
'cause I had Kelly Miller this year,

03:03.099 --> 03:05.393
and her dad just went to jail.
She was a lock.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.396
-Beer?
-Yeah.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.022
You guys wanna hear a juicy rumor?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.108
Oh, yes. Please.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.696
Is it that Rooster gives himself perms
at home?

03:16.779 --> 03:17.947
'Cause that ain't a rumor.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.951
[chuckles] No, but that is awesome.

03:22.034 --> 03:24.496
[chuckles] God gave me this hair.

03:24.579 --> 03:27.164
And on the seventh day, he rested.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.002
Yeah, well, they're shutting down
Norwood High.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.337
They're gonna merge with Garrison.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.381
We're gonna have
double the students next year.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.798
That's a real shame.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.842
There's a lot of history
between our schools.

03:37.925 --> 03:39.719
Yeah, a lot of people are gonna
lose their jobs.

03:39.802 --> 03:43.306
I mean, they're Norwood teachers,
so they can suck it! [chuckles]

03:44.516 --> 03:45.933
But it is still sad.

03:47.935 --> 03:50.104
Weird. Losing our arch enemy.

03:50.187 --> 03:53.400
It's like... Colt losing math.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.654
Yeah, who's gonna be our rival now?

03:57.737 --> 03:58.988
We used to have one rival.

03:59.071 --> 04:01.157
You subtract one rival,
that equals zero rivals.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.117
In your face!

04:04.494 --> 04:06.288
All right, I'm out of here.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.791
Hanging with you guys
is like watching MSNBC.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.963
Every few years, I'll click over to it,
just to remind myself how much I hate it.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.675
Not you, sweetheart.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.468
Wait, Mr. Bennett, before you leave...

04:20.552 --> 04:22.304
-Colt, did you tell 'em yet?
-No, I was waiting for you.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.431
All right. Abby and I got some news.

04:25.222 --> 04:27.267
What are you guys doing on June 28th?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.352
Well, let me check my calendar.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.564
Ranching.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.901
Well, you pick your prettiest heifer
and make her your plus-one,

04:36.984 --> 04:38.778
'cause that's the day
we're getting married.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.240
Oh. Bring a heifer to a wedding, huh?
I've been there.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.120
Congratulations.
That's right around the corner.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.123
Yeah, figured I ought to do it soon
before Abby came to her senses.

04:51.207 --> 04:52.208
[chuckles]

04:52.292 --> 04:55.962
Whoa, whoa, whoa. June 28th?
That's John Elway's birthday--

04:56.045 --> 04:57.880
Fuck, yeah, it is! [laughs]

05:00.633 --> 05:02.302
What? Is that...
Is that why you picked that date?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.470
Fuck, yeah, it is!

05:07.181 --> 05:09.183
[theme song playing]

06:14.499 --> 06:15.500
Joanne.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.586
-Hey, Beau.
-Hey.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.754
[chuckles]

06:21.380 --> 06:24.300
-When'd you get back from Phoenix?
-Just last night.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.803
And thank God.
That city's depressing.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.389
Just a lot of old people sitting around,
waiting to die.

06:32.224 --> 06:33.935
-Phoenix, huh?
-Yeah.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.687
-Sounds all right to me.
-[chuckles]

06:36.688 --> 06:39.106
-Well, sit.
-Thank you.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.652
How's your daughter doing?

06:42.735 --> 06:45.362
Much better, thanks. How are your boys?

06:45.447 --> 06:46.531
Much worse.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.452
Sorry I've been so bad
about keeping in touch.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.954
But these last few months
with my daughter have been so crazy.

06:53.037 --> 06:57.041
The lawyers, the rehab, jail,
taking care of my granddaughter...

06:57.124 --> 06:59.335
-There's no need to apologize.
-[chuckles]

06:59.418 --> 07:01.045
And, look, I'd...
I'd love to stay and chat,

07:01.128 --> 07:02.880
but I gotta get to the Cracker Barrel.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.091
I called in sick for my last 72 shifts.

07:05.174 --> 07:07.134
I think they're starting
to get suspicious.

07:08.385 --> 07:09.929
That's no problem.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.931
I was there the other night.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.559
If you run into
a college fella named Chad,

07:14.642 --> 07:16.978
tell him I'm still waiting
for my iced tea.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.858
[sighs] So, we gotta find a time
to catch up.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.400
Yeah.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.237
You wanna come over to the Cracker Barrel?
I get off at 5:00.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.990
We can sit in Chad's section
and stiff him.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.910
Actually, I'm going out tonight.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.411
Oh! [laughs]

07:34.496 --> 07:36.706
Beau Bennett going out. [laughing]

07:39.375 --> 07:42.169
You got funnier since I've been gone.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.841
-No, I've been seeing someone.
-Oh.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.093
Really?

07:49.176 --> 07:51.513
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.222
Anybody I know?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.642
Uh, Brenda, from the hair salon.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.935
I know Brenda. She's great.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.522
I went out on a couple of dates
in Phoenix,

08:00.605 --> 08:04.859
but all the guys I met were either
fathers of people in rehab,

08:04.942 --> 08:07.069
or in rehab themselves.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.448
With the old people
and the recovering meth addicts,

08:11.533 --> 08:13.367
it's hard to find people with teeth.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.079
So, you still wanna get together?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.916
Of course.
There's even more to catch up on.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.460
How 'bout Sunday? Come by the ranch.

08:23.545 --> 08:26.506
Great.
I wanna see what else has changed.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.675
Next, you'll tell me you're eating sushi.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.220
-Well--
-Are you fucking kidding me?

08:41.103 --> 08:42.479
-Ab.
-Yeah?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.274
Can you get a hair person
for the wedding?

08:45.357 --> 08:46.776
Yeah, probably.

08:46.859 --> 08:51.155
You think they have, like, a time limit,
or can they do multiple people?

08:51.238 --> 08:53.741
-Yes, you can use my hair person.
-Oh, great.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.618
Can I have her e-mail?

08:55.702 --> 08:59.121
'Cause I got a Pinterest board with
some styles that I've been playing with.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.289
[laughing]

09:01.457 --> 09:05.545
Oh, you know what, actually,
I got some other ideas about the wedding.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.547
Great! Let me get mine.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.806
Babe, seems you're
a little further ahead than I am.

09:16.889 --> 09:17.890
[chuckles]

09:18.975 --> 09:21.227
-Well, I did plan a wedding last year.
-Oh.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.396
Yeah, I remember. I stole you from him.

09:25.397 --> 09:28.150
Yeah. We ruined a guy's life.
Good for us.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.403
[sighs] These are just some old notes.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.240
You know, on DJs,
florists, caterers, venues...

09:35.157 --> 09:37.326
silverware, songs,
rentals, transportation.

09:37.409 --> 09:40.037
Oh, and I've got info on a guy

09:40.121 --> 09:43.124
who can train doves
how to fly in the shape of a heart.

09:43.207 --> 09:47.003
Oh! Awesome.
After the wedding, we can get--

09:47.086 --> 09:49.296
No, you and your groomsmen cannot
shoot them.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.049
Fine.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.678
Well, at least we can line dance
to "Cotton-Eye Joe," right?

09:56.428 --> 09:57.429
Maybe.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.558
But we definitely can't afford a flyover
from the Blue Angels!

10:03.060 --> 10:04.061
I'm way ahead of you.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.147
We find out
where they're gonna be on June 28th,

10:06.230 --> 10:08.733
and we get married
somewhere underneath them.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.571
-Hey, Abby.
-Hey.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.574
Did you get that cattle guard cleaned out?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.244
Oh, no. Me and Abby were just
going over some wedding stuff.

10:20.327 --> 10:22.747
Oh. I have some thoughts.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.251
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:27.334 --> 10:30.797
What if by the time you get married,
the fucking cattle guard was clean?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.841
[laughs] Yes, Mr. Bennett!

10:34.508 --> 10:35.885
Whoo!

10:35.968 --> 10:38.137
-I hate it when you two hang out.
-[chuckles]

10:39.639 --> 10:42.684
That's what you got to look forward to
for the rest of your life.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.689
Don't worry, I've been engaged before.
Doesn't always stick.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.775
Hey, what are you doing on Sunday?

10:50.858 --> 10:53.027
I was thinking of getting the caterers
to bring over some options.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.946
I'll have mine medium rare.

10:56.948 --> 11:00.034
Okay, I'll put you down
for one medium rare sea bass.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.996
-I already have plans.
-Oh.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.832
Joanne's coming by for dinner.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.168
Ooh. [chuckles]

11:09.251 --> 11:13.505
Joanne? An old flame has been relit.

11:16.633 --> 11:18.135
-You're family now.
-[chuckles]

11:18.219 --> 11:20.096
I can tell you to shut the hell up.

11:23.390 --> 11:27.019
Okay, but how does Brenda feel
about you spending time with her?

11:27.103 --> 11:30.314
Why would Brenda care?
It's just two friends having dinner.

11:30.397 --> 11:31.607
[chuckles]

11:31.690 --> 11:34.360
You don't think it'd be a good idea
to talk to her about it?

11:34.443 --> 11:38.072
I don't think it's a good idea
to talk to anybody about anything.

11:41.408 --> 11:42.534
All right. Well, I...

11:42.618 --> 11:45.788
I'm just saying, if Colt was going out
with his ex-girlfriend for dinner

11:45.872 --> 11:48.040
and didn't tell me,
I don't think I'd be too happy about it.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.126
Of course, last time he did that,
he got a girl pregnant,

11:50.209 --> 11:51.961
so I might be paranoid.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.884
There's nothing going on
between me and Joanne.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.593
All right, I get it.

11:59.676 --> 12:02.471
But if you don't tell her
and she finds out from someone else,

12:02.554 --> 12:05.516
she's gonna think you're hiding something.
Like a baby.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.478
Maybe I am making this about me.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.857
No, I think you're right.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.734
It's probably best to be up front.

12:16.568 --> 12:19.947
-Thanks, Abby.
-Oh, please. Anytime.

12:20.031 --> 12:23.200
I believe the more we open up
and talk about our feelings, the better.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.245
A problem shared is a problem halved.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.250
-Abby?
-Yeah?

12:31.333 --> 12:32.709
Shut the hell up.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.258
Hey. What you doin' here?

12:40.301 --> 12:43.637
I need your help. Gotta move
that cattle guard so I can clean it.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.556
-[toilet flushing]
-[sighs]

12:48.434 --> 12:49.435
Who's that?

12:50.061 --> 12:51.437
Don't worry about it.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.690
[chuckles] You got a girl over.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.068
[laughs] Who is it?

12:57.151 --> 13:00.529
Pregnant Linda?
Cindy, from the Dairy Queen?

13:00.612 --> 13:03.699
Old Coach Jensen come over to teach you
a couple of wrestling moves? [chuckles]

13:05.451 --> 13:08.079
You really wanna know? All right.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.581
[sighs] I'm sorry, bro. It's Abby.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.920
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

13:16.003 --> 13:19.090
Hey. Rachel, my brother, Colt.
Colt, my friend Rachel.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.300
Nice to meet you, Rachel. [chuckles]

13:21.383 --> 13:22.509
How'd you two meet?

13:22.593 --> 13:24.511
You smell turpentine
and then wake up here?

13:24.595 --> 13:25.721
[chuckles]

13:26.763 --> 13:28.349
-We met on Tinder.
-[Colt] Oh.

13:28.432 --> 13:29.934
He looked so cute in his picture.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.936
-[chuckles]
-[Colt] Oh, yeah?

13:32.019 --> 13:34.688
Bet you can't wait
to get on Piglet's boat.

13:34.771 --> 13:36.065
[chuckles]

13:37.691 --> 13:39.235
It does look awesome.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.196
[sighs] Yeah, it is awesome.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.323
Unfortunately, I don't got it right now.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.532
Loaned it out to them, uh,

13:45.616 --> 13:47.701
Fast and Furious  people
for their new movie.

13:47.784 --> 13:49.996
Hey, you can't tell nobody, but, uh...

13:50.079 --> 13:51.747
[clicks tongue] they're doing boats.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.502
That wasn't the only thing.
Our profiles totally matched up.

13:56.585 --> 14:00.464
You know, EDM, vaping,
we both think puppies are low-key lit.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.765
Yeah. Boy, that's...
that's off-the-chain ill. [chuckles]

14:10.474 --> 14:11.683
Excuse me?

14:13.895 --> 14:15.312
Word.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.690
-All right, I'm gonna get going.
-[Rooster] Mmm-hmm.

14:18.774 --> 14:20.359
It's nice to meet you.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.070
Sure I'll be seeing you on Amber Alert.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.992
Yeah.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.869
Sorry about my donkey brother.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.829
[sighs] So, you hungry?

14:32.914 --> 14:34.206
I was about to do up some sandwiches.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.543
You know, a little, uh,
roast beef and chill.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.130
I actually gotta go, too.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.507
Oh, well. You don't gotta.
I was gonna throw on  The Bachelor.

14:43.590 --> 14:45.301
Yeah, my ex got me hooked.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.929
Brad's got a two-on-one date
with, uh, Kim and Sasha,

14:48.012 --> 14:50.472
and those chicks fuckin' hate each other.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.142
Are... are you serious?

14:53.225 --> 14:57.354
I'm, like, you know... low-key serious.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.900
-I don't really, like, watch TV.
-Yeah.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.526
No. Duh. I mean... [scoffs]

15:02.609 --> 15:04.528
on my laptop. Yeah. [chuckles]

15:04.611 --> 15:07.198
No, I just got that thing here,
uh, ironically.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.282
Okay.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.077
[clears throat] So, you wanna
do something on Friday?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.537
[groans] I'm supposed to hang out
with my friends.

15:13.620 --> 15:15.957
Oh. Cool.
Yeah, just bring 'em on over here.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.499
That'd be perf.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
Ooh, maybe we can go to your lake house?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.589
Yeah, man, that would be perf.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.217
Guess you didn't hear, though.
Massive fire.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.468
Yeah, sucks.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.012
Pretty much burned up everything
in my profile.

15:31.555 --> 15:32.639
Really?

15:33.599 --> 15:34.934
Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.353
The house, Lamborghini...

15:38.270 --> 15:40.814
Shit. Fuckin' tigers barely got out,
you know?

15:45.694 --> 15:48.155
Imagine your target is
something you hate.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.573
Kim Jong Un.

15:49.656 --> 15:51.075
[glass shatters]

15:51.158 --> 15:54.745
Vladimir, whatever his fuckin'
middle name is, Putin.

15:54.828 --> 15:55.955
[glass shatters]

15:58.124 --> 15:59.625
Bud Light Lime.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.043
[glass shatters]

16:02.669 --> 16:04.838
All right, be careful.

16:05.547 --> 16:09.260
Guns are like my kids.
Always assume they're loaded.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.097
Well, at least
your kids aren't lethal weapons.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.516
Well, they're fuckin' killing me.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.644
Just relax.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.687
Settle on the target.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.274
Squeeze real slow. Don't pull it.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.442
Yeah, yeah.
Just let me blow some shit up.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.988
-[glass shatters]
-Oh! Yes!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.114
All right, that's it.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.823
I'm no longer a Democrat.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.951
How much ammo do you have?

16:35.786 --> 16:39.290
I've learned answering that question
makes people uncomfortable.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.582
[Brenda chuckles]

16:41.417 --> 16:43.377
Hey, I've got something to talk about.

16:43.460 --> 16:47.756
Well, if it's how good I look
with this gun, you don't have to tell me.

16:47.839 --> 16:48.799
[glass shatters]

16:49.591 --> 16:53.387
My friend Joanne's back in town.
We're gonna have dinner tomorrow night.

16:53.470 --> 16:54.930
Okay.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.848
-[glass shatters]
-Ah, yes!

16:56.932 --> 17:00.144
Let's see those Supercuts assholes
steal a customer from me now.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.689
I just wanted to tell you about Joanne

17:03.772 --> 17:06.400
so you didn't hear from somebody else,
get the wrong idea.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.984
Well, what idea would that be?

17:08.069 --> 17:12.448
Well... Joanne and I spent
some time together a little while back.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.952
Are you trying to tell me that I'm not
the first woman that you spent time with?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.538
'Cause I do know
how those kids of yours came to be.

17:20.914 --> 17:23.417
It never got that serious with Joanne.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.671
Besides, I told her about you.

17:27.754 --> 17:30.049
Beau, you're the most honorable person
I know.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.801
If you say there's nothing to worry about,
then I'm not worried.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.263
And I'm not just saying this
'cause I'm holding this gun.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.932
I appreciate your understanding.

17:39.015 --> 17:40.892
Hey, you got any bigger guns?

17:42.394 --> 17:45.564
I've learned that the answer to that
question makes people uncomfortable.

17:45.647 --> 17:46.690
[laughs]

17:53.029 --> 17:55.491
Okay, keep an open mind. Right?

17:55.574 --> 17:59.995
I know it doesn't look like much now,
but you just have to use your imagination.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.540
We'll be feeding each other cake
at the sweetheart table over here.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.960
And Rooster will be unsuccessfully
hitting on bridesmaids over there.

18:07.043 --> 18:09.255
And over there. And over there.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.468
Hank? What are you doing here?

18:15.177 --> 18:18.222
What? I can go other places.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.102
Look, Hank's here. Feels like home.

18:23.935 --> 18:24.936
Yeah.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.190
I don't know, I... I was just...

18:28.274 --> 18:31.527
picturing something bigger, you know?
Something a little more unique.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.736
[sighs]

18:32.819 --> 18:36.240
We are not getting married
at Talladega Speedway.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.159
Not with that attitude.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.703
Look, I have done
a lot of research, all right?

18:41.787 --> 18:45.040
And the next bigger place is
Grand Junction History Museum.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.918
I'm not having the first time
you go to a museum be at our wedding.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.337
It's just... this place ain't gonna work.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.631
I mean, I got a big family.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.717
And lots of friends.
It's also somebody's birthday.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.595
John Elway is not coming to our wedding.

18:59.805 --> 19:00.889
Not with that attitude.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.724
[Abby sighs]

19:02.808 --> 19:06.061
Colt, look. Bigger means more expensive.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.104
And it's just one day of our life.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.024
Why don't we save that money
for something more important,

19:11.107 --> 19:15.196
like a house, or... the Peterson Ranch.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.030
Or a couple of sweet-ass Jet Skis.

19:17.113 --> 19:18.907
[chuckles] They're gonna be
on the registry.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.368
John Elway can do
with that information what he will.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.120
I just...

19:24.871 --> 19:27.333
I don't know, it's just...
It doesn't feel like the place.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.000
There ain't even room for a band.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.920
No, we're not doing a band,
we're getting a DJ.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.340
-A DJ?
-Yeah.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.550
Okay, you're worried about money,
but you wanna pay some guy

19:36.633 --> 19:38.009
to press play on an iPod?

19:38.927 --> 19:40.304
Okay, you don't want a DJ?

19:40.387 --> 19:42.889
We'll hire your cousin's band
and we can have our first dance

19:42.973 --> 19:45.601
while they play Lynyrd Skynyrd
on the spoons and a washboard.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.522
Okay. Well, whether we hire 'em or not,
they're gonna play at the wedding.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.693
Do I not get to make any decisions here?

19:54.776 --> 19:57.279
Look, I'm sorry. You're the one
who wants to get married this summer.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.281
And having most of this figured out
is a way to do that.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.032
Well, I don't want
Kenny's fucking wedding.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.702
It's not Kenny's wedding.
It's just stuff I know I want.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.954
-Well, what about what I want?
-You can choose a lot of things.

20:06.037 --> 20:07.414
Like, what about the tuxedos?

20:07.498 --> 20:08.707
Oh. Uh, camo.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.667
-No, that is ridiculous!
-No!

20:10.751 --> 20:14.129
What's ridiculous is getting married
in Hank's backup bar!

20:16.507 --> 20:18.550
You know, it's really easy
to shit on all of my decisions,

20:18.634 --> 20:20.219
but I don't see you coming up
with anything better.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.345
You won't let me come up with anything!

20:21.428 --> 20:22.846
Because I don't want
my wedding to look like

20:22.929 --> 20:24.765
a fuckin' episode of  Duck Dynasty!

20:30.145 --> 20:31.772
I never got that show.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.692
[EDM music playing]

20:38.445 --> 20:39.696
This is great.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.033
Yeah, yeah. Your friends are cool.

20:43.116 --> 20:46.077
Yeah, they're all bitches.
I love them.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.291
Yeah, my friends are bitches, too.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.378
Hey, do you wanna do Molly?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.004
Yeah, if you're into that.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.465
Which one of these chicks is Molly?

21:01.134 --> 21:02.511
-Oh.
-Sorry.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.472
It's okay.
Uh, Samantha, your dad's here.

21:06.181 --> 21:08.892
-Uh, what?
-And he's hot!

21:08.975 --> 21:11.395
Oh, uh... yeah. No.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.522
I'm not here to pick anyone up. I...

21:14.481 --> 21:18.026
-I'm hot?
-Yeah, and I'm Jessie.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.737
Hi, Jessie. I'm Colt.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.951
And I'm engaged to
a very beautiful woman named Jessie.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.786
Abby. Goodbye.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.332
Oh. Hey. What's up?

21:31.415 --> 21:34.209
Welcome to the party.
You remember my brother, Colt.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.378
No.

21:39.172 --> 21:43.134
-[chuckles] What's going down?
-Uh, Abby and I got in a big fight.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.304
Just came to hang out.
Who are all these people?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.056
These are my friends.
What's up, Gabe?

21:49.891 --> 21:51.893
Honestly, that might be Kyle.
I don't know.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.145
We'll talk outside.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.275
Samantha, your dad's leaving!

21:59.360 --> 22:00.861
No, I'm...

22:01.987 --> 22:03.364
Just tell her to hurry up.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.077
Hey, y'all. Keep the party going, huh?
Gonna do a beer run.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.500
-Dude, call the cops.
-[chuckles] What?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.835
No. I can't take this shit, okay?

22:16.918 --> 22:19.880
I need this party busted
and these fucking kids to go home.

22:19.963 --> 22:23.091
The Rooster wants
the party to be over? [chuckles]

22:23.174 --> 22:25.636
Hey. Remember that old guy
who used to buy us beer?

22:25.719 --> 22:27.846
Oh, yeah. Rick.

22:27.929 --> 22:31.767
We'd have to pick it up at his apartment
and then he'd make us watch him do curls.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.729
That dude was fuckin' creepy.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.731
Yeah. Well, I'm him now.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.983
You don't fill out a tank top like he did.

22:40.066 --> 22:43.069
No. Come on, dude.
I'm country strong, all right?

22:43.153 --> 22:45.071
I don't got beach muscles.
That's a whole different thing.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.701
[sighs] Look, man.
That chick Rachel is hot,

22:49.785 --> 22:53.539
but I kinda want her
and all her friends to die.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.670
You'll get a kick out of this.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.131
The other day, Dale was at the doctor,

23:03.214 --> 23:05.592
and the guy's trying to tell him
there's nothing wrong with him.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.804
Only, Dale doesn't have
his hearing aids turned on,

23:08.887 --> 23:10.055
so he can't hear a lick.

23:10.138 --> 23:12.307
[chuckles] Oh, no. What'd he do?

23:12.390 --> 23:14.893
Well, he turned 'em on
and the doctor said he's fine.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.771
Uh-huh, and then what happened?

23:17.854 --> 23:21.567
Uh... I assume Dale went on home.
I don't know.

23:24.069 --> 23:28.574
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
You still can't tell a story for shit.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.954
I'm really glad you're back.
I missed you, Joanne.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.583
[chuckles] Thanks.

23:39.417 --> 23:43.589
So, look, if you're up for it,
I thought we could watch  Red Dawn.

23:44.422 --> 23:47.593
High school football players
in the mountains of Colorado...

23:48.301 --> 23:49.427
killin' Russians.

23:50.136 --> 23:52.639
It's like they made the movie
just for me.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.433
Actually, I should get going.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.018
Okay, you pick the movie.

23:57.102 --> 24:01.607
But I'd prefer something where
communists or Nazis are gettin' killed.

24:03.149 --> 24:05.527
No, it... It's not that. It's just...

24:07.738 --> 24:09.155
It doesn't matter.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.825
Joanne, what?

24:13.577 --> 24:16.705
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,
but talk to me.

24:17.623 --> 24:21.042
I can't go back to just being friends.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.212
I thought we both moved on.

24:24.295 --> 24:27.132
I mean, you said
you were dating in Phoenix.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.176
Yeah, I did.
But now that I'm here, you know,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.221
all the old feelings just come back.

24:33.304 --> 24:34.472
Well...

24:35.348 --> 24:37.225
it's not like I haven't thought about you.

24:37.308 --> 24:39.936
-[sighs]
-I have.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.231
It's just... I'm with Brenda now.

24:43.314 --> 24:45.817
I know. And...
and I'm really happy for you.

24:45.901 --> 24:50.196
But I can't be around you
and pretend that I don't want more.

24:52.365 --> 24:54.576
We can't be in each other's lives at all?

24:54.660 --> 25:00.081
[sighs] Well, we tried being friends...
and we just ended up right here kissing.

25:00.165 --> 25:02.167
Yeah. We did.

25:03.334 --> 25:04.502
All right, I should go.

25:05.378 --> 25:06.797
Joanne, wait.

25:08.131 --> 25:09.132
Yeah?

25:12.135 --> 25:13.679
You take care of yourself.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.015
You too, Beau.

25:32.989 --> 25:35.826
-Rooster.
-Hey. You got a second to talk?

25:35.909 --> 25:37.703
Uh, sure. Yeah.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.333
-What's up?
-[exhales heavily]

25:43.416 --> 25:45.877
-Did you watch  The Bachelor?
-[scoffs] Yeah.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.756
You see Karen accidentally let her tit
flop out during the group date?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.344
I would have shoved that rose
right up her ass.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.387
[chuckles] I know, right?

25:56.471 --> 25:58.640
I mean, it's like,
is Brad that much of a catch?

25:58.724 --> 26:01.768
I feel like anybody can get laid
in a hot air balloon flying over Napa.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.061
[chuckles]

26:04.730 --> 26:06.898
Is this really
what you came to talk about?

26:08.024 --> 26:09.025
No.

26:10.944 --> 26:15.073
[sighs] I had a party
back at the cabin tonight.

26:16.574 --> 26:20.954
There was booze and a bunch of chicks,
and there was EDM.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.875
Which I either listened to or ingested,
I got no idea.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.417
[laughs]

26:27.335 --> 26:31.673
You know, it was the kind of thing that
back in the day, I would've loved, but...

26:33.925 --> 26:37.512
tonight, I just kept thinking how
I'd rather be here with you, you know?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.431
Trying to figure out if
Brad and Lisa had room

26:40.515 --> 26:43.685
in that hot air balloon to have sex
or if they just did a bunch of hand stuff.

26:43.769 --> 26:44.895
[chuckles]

26:45.603 --> 26:47.230
Oh, they definitely had room.

26:47.313 --> 26:49.983
[chuckles] That thing wasn't any smaller
than the babyGap dressing room,

26:50.066 --> 26:51.151
and we had sex in there.

26:51.234 --> 26:55.030
[chuckles] Yeah, you know?
That's what I'm saying.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.534
[sighs] It's like,
we had a good thing going.

26:59.617 --> 27:00.911
That's hard to find.

27:02.495 --> 27:03.538
I'm sorry I messed that up.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.501
You didn't mess it up, Rooster.
It was great.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.964
It, you know, just ran its course.

27:16.092 --> 27:17.761
I love you, Mary.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.179
No, you don't.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.931
Okay, that's a weird response.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.893
-Okay, I don't... I don't think you do.
-[sighs]

27:24.976 --> 27:27.688
And that's okay. You're just sad.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.858
I'm sad, too.
You know, that's how breakups work.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.444
Doesn't mean we made the wrong decision.

27:36.487 --> 27:37.530
Right.

27:40.450 --> 27:44.454
[exhales heavily] Well...
can't blame me for trying.

27:44.537 --> 27:47.040
No. [chuckles]
I certainly don't.

27:47.749 --> 27:48.959
Thanks, honey.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.879
Hey.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.843
You think, uh,
tonight would have gone any different

27:57.926 --> 27:59.594
if I showed up in a hot air balloon?

28:00.303 --> 28:02.222
[sighs] Honestly?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.182
Yeah.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.142
[chuckles]

28:12.357 --> 28:15.151
Colt, no. Turn around. Go away!

28:15.235 --> 28:17.904
That's the same thing they said
at my last NFL tryout.

28:20.281 --> 28:21.532
What's all this?

28:23.034 --> 28:25.370
Okay. Ta-da!

28:26.704 --> 28:30.959
Yeah. There were supposed to be lights
all over the driveway and the porch,

28:31.042 --> 28:34.587
but you showed up early
and ruined it, like an asshole.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.342
I'm sorry if you felt like
you weren't a part of my wedding.

28:39.425 --> 28:41.094
Our wedding. Shit, I'll get it.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.974
What... you wanna get married here?

28:46.057 --> 28:48.268
[chuckles] I don't care
where we get married.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.688
As long as I'm marrying you,
I'll be happy.

28:54.399 --> 28:55.650
Sorry I got so upset.

28:59.029 --> 29:02.282
-[chuckling]
-I love you,

29:02.365 --> 29:05.201
Abby Phillips Bennett. [chuckles]

29:06.244 --> 29:07.746
Okay, we'll talk about that.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.751
Look, the point is, if we do it here,
we can invite as many people as we want,

29:12.834 --> 29:15.754
and with the money that we save,
we can get a band,

29:15.837 --> 29:17.798
or whatever else you can think of.

29:17.881 --> 29:18.965
I get my own hair person?

29:19.758 --> 29:21.009
[chuckles]

29:21.092 --> 29:23.511
Yeah, and she got all your e-mails.
She doesn't want to work with you.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.349
I'm sorry I ruined your surprise.

29:29.184 --> 29:33.396
Well, you did not ruin
all of the surprises.

29:34.439 --> 29:35.440
Oh, my God.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.192
John Elway's in the house
right now, isn't he?

29:37.984 --> 29:40.111
-John! John Elway!
-No, no!

29:40.195 --> 29:41.947
John Elway's not in the house.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.283
That's exactly what you'd say
if John Elway was in the house.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.368
Okay, no, stop. It's fine.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.371
This is the surprise.

29:51.706 --> 29:55.001
Holy shit.
Is that the wedding dress?

29:56.502 --> 29:57.587
Fuck, no.

29:58.797 --> 30:03.759
But I will wear it at the reception
when we play this.
