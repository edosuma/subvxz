WOODS NEAR QUANTICO, VA

02:39.480 --> 02:41.436
Starling!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.916
Starling!

02:46.920 --> 02:49.718
Crawford wants to see you in his office.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.796
Thank you, sir.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.156
- Clarice.
- Hey.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.190
You looking for Crawford? He should
be back in a minute. Wait in his office.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.791
Starling.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.196
- Clarice M. Good morning.
- Morning, Mr Crawford.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.551
Sorry to pull you off the course
at such short notice.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.752
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.872
I hope so. They haven't
posted any grades yet.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.628
A job's come up and I thought about you.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.992
Not a job, really. More of
an interesting errand. Sit down.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.872
Yes, sir.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.836
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,

05:56.960 --> 06:00.794
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years. I gave you an A.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.275
A-minus, sir.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.877
Double major: psych and criminology.
Graduated magna.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.673
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.

06:10.800 --> 06:15.476
It says, when you graduate, you wanna
work for me in Behavioural Science.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.556
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.670
We're interviewing all serial killers now in
custody for a psycho-behavioural profile.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.314
Could be a real help in unsolved cases.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.874
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.279
- Do you spook easily, Starling?
- Not yet, sir.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.073
See, the one we want most
refuses to cooperate.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.873
I want you to go after him
again today in the asylum.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.879
- Who's the subject?
- The psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.150
Hannibal the Cannibal.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.840
I don't expect him to talk to you.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.429
But I have to be able to say we tried.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.552
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.116
How does he look? How does
his cell look? Is he sketching, drawing?

06:58.240 --> 07:00.800
If he is, what's he sketching?

07:03.760 --> 07:06.320
Here's a dossier on Lecter.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.836
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.520
Have your memo on my desk
by 0900 Wednesday.

07:14.640 --> 07:16.596
OK.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.915
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison for so many years.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.237
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?

07:26.360 --> 07:30.911
I wish there were.
Now, I want your full attention, Starling.

07:31.040 --> 07:34.350
- Yes, sir.
- Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.

07:34.840 --> 07:39.197
Dr Chilton at the asylum will go over all
the physical procedures used with him.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.790
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.388
And you're to tell him nothing personal.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.956
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.992
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.109
And what is that?

07:53.560 --> 07:57.394
Oh, he's a monster. A pure psychopath.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.950
So rare to capture one alive.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.392
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.995
We get a lot of detectives here, but
I can't ever remember one as attractive.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.674
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?

08:17.800 --> 08:22.715
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.956
I'm sure this is a great town, Dr Chilton,

08:25.080 --> 08:30.279
but my instructions are to talk to Dr Lecter
and report back this afternoon.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.597
I see. Well, let's make this quick, then.

08:33.720 --> 08:38.270
We've tried to study him, but he's much
too sophisticated for the standard tests.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.595
Oh, my, does he hate us!

08:40.720 --> 08:43.837
He thinks I'm his nemesis.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.913
Crawford's very clever,
isn't he, using you?

08:47.040 --> 08:51.158
- What do you mean, sir?
- A pretty, young woman to turn him on.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.234
I don't believe Lecter's
seen a woman in eight years.

08:54.360 --> 08:58.069
And are you ever his taste! So to speak.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.078
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It's not a charm school.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.670
Good. Then you should
be able to remember the rules.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.954
Do not touch or approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.

09:11.080 --> 09:14.675
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paperclips in his paper.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.396
Use the sliding food carrier. If he attempts
to pass you anything, do not accept it.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.035
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, I understand, sir.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.352
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.

09:26.480 --> 09:31.838
On July 9, 1991, he complained of chest
pains and was taken to the dispensary.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.520
His restraints were removed for an EKG.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.235
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.

09:40.120 --> 09:44.671
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less, save one of her eyes.

09:44.800 --> 09:49.191
His pulse never got above 95,
even when he ate her tongue.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.753
- I keep him in here.
- Dr Chilton.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.070
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,

09:58.200 --> 10:02.955
then maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself. What do you think?

10:06.080 --> 10:10.790
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.

10:10.920 --> 10:15.948
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.758
When she's finished, bring her out.

10:47.360 --> 10:51.638
Hi, I'm Barney. He told you,
don't get near the glass?

10:52.160 --> 10:54.674
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.634
Nice to meet you, Clarice. You can
hang your coat up there if you like.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.115
Thank you. I will.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.588
He's past the others, the last cell.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.075
You keep to the right.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.713
- I put out a chair for you.
- That's very good. Thank you.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.758
I'll be watchin'. You'll do fine.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.996
Hi.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.795
I can smell your cunt!

12:01.520 --> 12:04.990
- Good morning.
- Dr Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.917
May I speak with you?

12:07.040 --> 12:09.554
You're one of Jack Crawford's,
aren't you?

12:09.680 --> 12:13.753
- I am, yes.
- May I see your credentials?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.316
Certainly.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.715
Closer, please.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.272
Closer.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.757
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.589
I'm still in training at the academy.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.513
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

12:53.800 --> 12:57.679
Yes, I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.555
Maybe you can decide whether or not
I'm qualified enough to do that.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.152
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.955
Sit, please.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.034
Now then, tell me.
What did Miggs say to you?

13:23.160 --> 13:25.754
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.

13:25.880 --> 13:28.952
He hissed at you. What did he say?

13:30.320 --> 13:33.118
He said ''I can smell your cunt.''

13:33.440 --> 13:35.874
I see.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.355
I myself cannot.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.955
You use Evyan skin cream.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.353
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.995
But not today.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.840
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?

14:03.920 --> 14:07.071
That is the Duomo
seen from the Belvedere.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.957
- Do you know Florence?
- All that detail just from memory, sir?

14:13.080 --> 14:16.959
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.

14:17.080 --> 14:22.712
Well, perhaps you'd care to lend us
your view on this questionnaire, sir.

14:22.840 --> 14:25.434
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.236
You were doing fine. You had been
courteous and receptive to courtesy.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.638
You had established trust, with
the embarrassing truth about Miggs.

14:34.760 --> 14:39.311
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.910
- It won't do.
- I'm only asking you to look at this.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.996
Either you will or you won't.

14:46.120 --> 14:49.749
Yeah. Jack Crawford
must be very busy indeed

14:49.880 --> 14:52.553
if he's recruiting help
from the student body.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.353
Busy hunting that new one: Buffalo Bill.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.630
What a naughty boy he is.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.157
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?

15:01.280 --> 15:04.556
Please tell me.
The newspapers won't say.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.114
It started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.153
They said
''This one likes to skin his humps.''

15:13.360 --> 15:18.593
Why do you think he removes
their skins, Agent Starling?

15:18.720 --> 15:20.870
Thrill me with your acumen.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.839
It excites him. Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.

15:26.960 --> 15:30.873
- I didn't.
- No. No, you ate yours.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.476
You send that through now.

16:01.480 --> 16:06.270
Oh, Agent Starling, you think you can
dissect me with this blunt little tool?

16:06.400 --> 16:09.233
No. I thought that your knowledge...

16:09.360 --> 16:11.510
You're so ambitious, aren't you?

16:11.880 --> 16:15.350
Do you know what you look like, with
your good bag and your cheap shoes?

16:15.480 --> 16:17.471
You look like a rube.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.513
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube,
with a little taste.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.515
Good nutrition's given you length of bone,

16:24.640 --> 16:29.668
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash, are you?

16:29.800 --> 16:34.590
And that accent you've tried so
desperately to shed: pure West Virginia.

16:34.720 --> 16:38.713
What is your father, dear? Is he
a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.479
How quickly the boys found you.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.070
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,

16:45.200 --> 16:48.556
while you could only dream of
getting out, getting anywhere,

16:48.680 --> 16:52.673
getting all the way to the FBI.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.159
You see a lot, Doctor.

16:58.280 --> 17:04.116
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?

17:04.240 --> 17:09.678
What about it? Why don't you look at
yourself and write down what you see?

17:09.800 --> 17:12.155
Or maybe you're afraid to.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.598
A census taker once tried to test me.

17:23.720 --> 17:26.871
I ate his liver with some fava beans

17:27.000 --> 17:29.355
and a nice Chianti.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.677
You fly back to school now, little Starling.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.313
Fly, fly, fly.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.753
I bit my wrist so I can die.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.996
Look at the blood!

18:04.120 --> 18:07.874
- Got ya!
- Miggs, you stupid fuck!

18:10.600 --> 18:13.478
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Agent Starling! Come back!

18:13.600 --> 18:17.354
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.392
- Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly.
- Then do this test.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.512
No, but I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.359
- And what is that?
- Advancement. Listen carefully.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.994
Look deep within yourself,
Clarice Starling.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.829
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T.

18:32.960 --> 18:37.954
I don't think Miggs could manage again
so soon, even though he is crazy. Go!

19:18.160 --> 19:20.116
Hey, Bill.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.155
- Daddy!
- Hey, Clarice.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.594
- Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
- No, angel. They all got away today.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.270
FBI. Hands up. Don't move.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.188
Turn around.
Hands behind your back. Thumbs up.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.835
You're dead, Starling.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.919
Johnson, good entry, good command.
Starling, where's your danger area?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.393
- The corner.
- Did you check?

20:11.520 --> 20:13.158
- No.
- That's why you're dead.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.431
3109.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.677
3109. Breaking doors or windows

20:18.800 --> 20:21.519
to enter or exit.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.959
Rule 404.

20:41.080 --> 20:45.073
- Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
- Crawford? Thanks, Ardelia.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.914
- Starling?
- Sir?

20:48.040 --> 20:50.349
Miggs is dead.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.152
Dead?

20:52.280 --> 20:53.679
How?

20:53.800 --> 20:57.190
They heard Lecter whispering to him
all afternoon and Miggs crying.

20:57.320 --> 21:01.313
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.917
- Starling?
- Yeah. I'm still here, sir.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.077
I just... I don't know how to feel about this.

21:09.640 --> 21:13.997
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.

21:14.120 --> 21:19.638
Look, I know it got ugly today, but
you mentioned a name at the end: Mofet.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.115
Any follow-up on her?

21:22.240 --> 21:25.391
Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories,

21:25.520 --> 21:28.876
so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet, but

21:29.000 --> 21:33.073
I thought the ''yourself'' reference
was too hokey for Lecter,

21:33.200 --> 21:37.079
so I figured he's from Baltimore
and I looked in the phone book

21:37.200 --> 21:42.957
and there's a ''Your Self'' storage facility
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.

21:45.280 --> 21:50.752
Unit 31 was leased for ten years,
pre-paid in full.

21:50.880 --> 21:55.670
The contract is in the name
of a Miss Hester Mofet.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.274
So nobody's been in here since 1990?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.595
Not to my knowledge.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.349
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.

22:06.080 --> 22:10.631
Yes. I won't disturb anything, I promise.
I'll be outta here before you know it.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.955
- May I help you?
- Yes, actually.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.993
- It's stuck.
- We could return tomorrow with my son.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.793
What about him?

22:25.920 --> 22:30.516
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labour.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.234
Right. Well, you just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.

23:06.960 --> 23:10.111
It's stuck. Hand me that flashlight, sir.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.153
If this door should fall down
or anything else,

23:28.720 --> 23:31.518
this is the number for
our Baltimore field office.

23:31.640 --> 23:35.394
Now they know that you're with me.
Call them if anything should happen.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.875
Yes, Miss Starling.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.555
Clarice. They're waiting for you.
Watch your step.

26:07.160 --> 26:11.073
Hester Mofet. It's an anagram,
isn't it, Doctor?

26:11.200 --> 26:14.192
Hester Mofet. ''The rest of me.''

26:14.560 --> 26:18.553
''Miss the rest of me.''
Meaning that you rented that garage?

26:52.800 --> 26:56.156
- Thank you.
- Your bleeding has stopped.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.476
How did you...?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.194
It's nothing. It was just a scratch.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.355
Dr Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?

27:08.480 --> 27:11.597
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?

27:11.720 --> 27:15.679
- Do you know something about him?
- I might if I saw the case file.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.236
- You could get that for me.
- Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?

27:19.360 --> 27:21.555
You wanted me to find him.

27:21.680 --> 27:26.879
His real name is Benjamin Raspail,
a former patient of mine,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.391
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.

27:31.960 --> 27:35.919
I did not kill him, merely tucked him
away very much as I found him,

27:36.040 --> 27:39.555
after he'd missed three appointments.

27:39.680 --> 27:44.879
- If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
- Who can say? Best thing for him, really.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.309
His therapy was going nowhere.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.354
His dress, make-up...

27:51.160 --> 27:55.153
- Raspail was a transvestite?
- In life? Oh, no.

27:55.280 --> 27:59.956
Garden-variety manic-depressive.
Tedious, very tedious.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.435
I now just think of him
as a kind of experiment.

28:02.560 --> 28:06.030
A fledgling killer's
first effort at transformation.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.913
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?

28:09.320 --> 28:13.438
Scared at first, then exhilarated.

28:13.920 --> 28:19.517
Jack Crawford is helping your career.
Apparently he likes you and you like him.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.596
I never thought about it.

28:21.720 --> 28:24.393
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you, sexually?

28:24.520 --> 28:29.514
True, he is much older, but do you think
he visualises scenarios, exchanges,

28:29.640 --> 28:31.995
fucking you?

28:33.760 --> 28:39.471
That doesn't interest me and, frankly,
it's the sort of thing that Miggs would say.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.915
Not any more.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.715
Thank you, Barney.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.115
What happened to your drawings?

28:58.120 --> 29:02.352
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel programme.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.358
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.

29:05.480 --> 29:08.677
Dr Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.830
What did you mean
by ''transformation'', Doctor?

29:20.400 --> 29:23.756
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.793
I know they will never ever
let me out while I'm alive.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.036
What I want is a view.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.869
I want a window where I can
see a tree, or even water.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.356
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr Chilton.

29:37.480 --> 29:41.951
What did you mean by ''fledgling killer''?
Are you saying that he's killed again?

29:42.080 --> 29:47.552
I'm offering you a psychological profile of
Buffalo Bill, based on the case evidence.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.875
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.436
You know who he is, don't you?

30:04.320 --> 30:06.754
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.792
All good things to those who wait.

30:09.920 --> 30:14.152
I've waited, Clarice, but how long
can you and old Jackie Boy wait?

30:14.600 --> 30:19.674
Our little Billy must already be
searching for that next special lady.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.869
MEMPHIS, TN

31:20.320 --> 31:22.276
Hey, little cheeper.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.311
I'll be right there.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.596
Can I help you with that?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.236
- Would you?
- Sure.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.993
- Thank you.
- You look kinda handicapped.

32:06.120 --> 32:10.477
Yeah. I got it this far. I just can't
get it up in the truck by myself.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.717
- Here. Grab this.
- OK.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.229
Just set it down. That's good.

32:16.360 --> 32:20.239
Get in the truck.
I wanna push it all the way up.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.796
I really appreciate this.
Thank you. Thank you.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.196
Push it all the way back.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.836
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.554
- That's great.
- OK.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.114
Say, are you about a size 14?

32:37.240 --> 32:39.196
Sorry?

32:58.680 --> 33:00.636
Good.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.396
Oh, good.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.473
Good.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.276
Starling!

33:53.080 --> 33:55.036
Outside. Let's go.

33:55.880 --> 33:59.395
Cindy. In the ring for Starling. Let's go.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.478
FBI!

34:08.600 --> 34:11.068
Pack your field gear.
You're going with Crawford.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.270
- Where?
- They found a girl's body.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.152
Been in the water a week.
It's a Buffalo Bill situation.

34:16.920 --> 34:21.197
CLAY COUNTY, W VA

34:27.760 --> 34:30.638
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.672
No evidence of rape
or physical abuse prior to death.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.951
All the mutilation
you see there is postmortem.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.992
OK, three days. Then he shoots them,

34:40.120 --> 34:44.318
skins them and dumps them,
each body in a different river.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.398
The water leaves us
no trace evidence of any kind.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.875
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.911
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,

34:53.040 --> 34:55.793
so actually she was the third girl found.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.832
After her, he got lazy.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.435
OK, let's see.

35:02.880 --> 35:07.032
Circles where the girls were abducted.
Arrows where their bodies were found.

35:07.160 --> 35:11.711
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.229
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.

35:34.360 --> 35:39.480
He's a white male. Serial killers tend
to hunt within their own ethnic groups.

35:39.600 --> 35:44.116
He's not a drifter. He's got his own
house somewhere, not an apartment.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.471
- Why?
- What he does with them takes privacy.

35:47.600 --> 35:51.957
He's in his thirties or forties.
He's got real physical strength,

35:52.080 --> 35:54.674
combined with
an older man's self-control.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.870
He's cautious, precise...

35:57.920 --> 36:00.878
And he's never impulsive.
He'll never stop.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.594
Why not?

36:03.720 --> 36:07.918
Got a real taste for it now
and he's getting better at his work.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.400
Not bad, Starling. Questions?

36:12.000 --> 36:16.790
Yes, sir. You haven't mentioned anything
about the information in my report

36:16.920 --> 36:18.990
or Dr Lecter's offer, sir.

36:19.120 --> 36:23.636
- I'm considering it.
- That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?

36:23.760 --> 36:26.558
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?

36:28.760 --> 36:34.153
Well, if that was the case, then
I just wish I was in on it, that's all.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.439
If I'd sent you in with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.

36:38.560 --> 36:42.155
He would have toyed with you
then turned to stone.

37:14.240 --> 37:17.357
Excuse me, Sheriff Perkins.
These are the FBI people.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.393
Sheriff Perkins - Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.069
Agent Starling. We appreciate
being invited into your jurisdiction.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.510
I didn't call you. That was
the state attorney's office.

37:28.640 --> 37:32.599
- We'll extend you every courtesy, but...
- Sheriff.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.430
This type of sex crime has certain aspects
I'd just as soon discuss in private.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.516
Know what I mean?

39:25.240 --> 39:28.630
- Oscar, fetch Dr Akins from the chapel.
- Starling, we're back here.

39:28.760 --> 39:31.991
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.237
Yeah, we'll be sending in a minute.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.234
I need a six-way linkup.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.351
Chicago, Detroit...

39:41.480 --> 39:43.436
What?

39:47.280 --> 39:50.829
Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,

39:50.960 --> 39:53.554
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.

39:53.680 --> 39:58.117
I know that y'all brought her this far and
her folks would thank you if they could

39:58.240 --> 40:00.390
for your kindness and your sensitivity.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.717
But now please go on now
and let us take care of her.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.556
Go on now.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.796
Thank you.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.517
Thank you.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.636
OK, good.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.520
Yeah, that's right. Elk River.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.995
Stand by for transmission.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.236
Ray.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.511
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.396
OK, Starling.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.676
Bill.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.598
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.636
A muzzle stamp at the top.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.830
Wrongful death.

41:48.960 --> 41:52.236
She'll have to go to
the state pathologist at Claxton.

41:52.360 --> 41:56.399
Well, I'd better get back to that service.
Lamar'll help you.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.476
Lord Almighty.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.278
What else do you see, Starling?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.755
Well, she's not local.

42:08.880 --> 42:13.874
Her ears are pierced three times
and there's glitter nail polish.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.355
That looks like town to me.

42:21.520 --> 42:27.152
Two of her fingernails are broken off
and there's dirt or grit under them.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.636
It looks like she's tried
to claw her way through something.

42:30.760 --> 42:35.231
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax 'em for Missing Persons.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.076
Let's do another.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.833
She's got something in her throat.

42:56.960 --> 43:01.636
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's leaves in the mouth.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.633
What is that? Some kind of seed pod?

43:35.160 --> 43:37.549
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.834
There's no way that could
get way down in there.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.758
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.

43:45.880 --> 43:49.395
She'll be easier to print when we turn
her over. Lamar, give me a hand.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.476
Yes, sir. I will.

43:55.120 --> 44:00.752
- Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
- Different configuration than the others.

44:00.880 --> 44:03.440
- Get close-ups.
- The victim's skin removed,

44:03.560 --> 44:06.950
this time in two large diamond-shaped
sections above the buttocks.

44:07.080 --> 44:10.516
Exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae,

44:10.640 --> 44:13.108
six inches from the right shoulder blade.

44:13.240 --> 44:18.758
Starling, when I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,

44:18.880 --> 44:20.836
that really burned you, didn't it?

44:20.960 --> 44:24.396
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.

44:24.520 --> 44:28.638
It matters, Mr Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.115
- It matters.
- Point taken.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.194
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.

44:41.320 --> 44:45.199
This would indicate that
the skinning was postmortem.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.833
- Time, Pilch. My move.
- You lured him with produce.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.316
Tough noogies. It's still my turn.

45:13.440 --> 45:15.635
Nice and slow, baby.

45:15.760 --> 45:19.514
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?

45:20.280 --> 45:22.635
Course it counts. How do you play?

45:23.520 --> 45:25.476
Agent Starling?

45:26.680 --> 45:30.070
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.

45:30.200 --> 45:34.512
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim in the Elk River.

45:34.640 --> 45:37.598
- It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
- I can't tell you any more.

45:37.720 --> 45:41.156
- We heard about it on the radio.
- This is a clue from a real murder case?

45:41.280 --> 45:44.795
- Cool.
- Just ignore him. He's not a PhD.

45:45.200 --> 45:48.033
Sphingid ceratomia, maybe.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.799
Boy, he's a big sucker.

45:51.200 --> 45:54.590
OK. Let's check morphology.

46:02.680 --> 46:06.912
What do you do when you're
not detecting, Agent Starling?

46:07.040 --> 46:09.395
I try to be a student, Dr Pilcher.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.077
Ever go out for cheeseburgers and beer?

46:13.200 --> 46:15.316
The amusing house wine?

46:15.640 --> 46:17.870
Are you hitting on me, Doctor?

46:18.000 --> 46:19.035
Yes.

46:19.160 --> 46:20.878
- Gotcha.
- What have you got?

46:21.000 --> 46:25.710
Agent Starling, meet Mr Acherontia styx.

46:26.200 --> 46:27.155
Weird.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.352
Better known to his friends
as the death's-head moth.

46:30.480 --> 46:34.473
- Where does it come from?
- It's strange. They only live in Asia.

46:34.600 --> 46:37.319
Here they'd have to be
raised from imported eggs.

46:37.440 --> 46:43.197
Somebody grew this guy. Fed him honey
and nightshade, kept him warm.

46:43.320 --> 46:45.788
Somebody loved him.

47:17.800 --> 47:19.756
Where are you?

47:20.680 --> 47:22.636
Let me outta here!

47:23.560 --> 47:25.516
Help me!

47:28.720 --> 47:30.676
Please!

47:31.200 --> 47:33.156
Please help me.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.157
Please!

47:38.280 --> 47:40.714
Why won't you answer me? Please!

47:43.560 --> 47:46.757
- Good morning. I'm Donna Feruchi.
- I'm Gene Cassel with sports.

47:46.880 --> 47:50.111
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.:

47:50.240 --> 47:53.949
Catherine Martin, the 25-year-old
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.277
listed as missing, is now
believed to have been kidnapped

47:57.400 --> 48:00.153
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.

48:00.280 --> 48:03.670
Police indicate that the girl's
blouse has been identified,

48:03.800 --> 48:08.237
sliced up the back, in what has become
a grim, all-too-familiar calling card.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.989
Young Catherine Martin is the only
daughter of Senator Ruth Martin,

48:12.120 --> 48:14.270
the Republican senator from Tennessee.

48:14.400 --> 48:17.710
Her kidnapping is not considered
to be politically motivated,

48:17.840 --> 48:20.877
but it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.

48:21.000 --> 48:25.357
Reached for comment on the ski slopes
of Vermont, the president is said to be,

48:25.480 --> 48:27.596
and I quote, ''intensely concerned''.

48:27.720 --> 48:32.111
Just moments ago Senator Martin
taped this dramatic personal plea.

48:32.240 --> 48:36.518
I'm speaking now to the person
who is holding my daughter.

48:36.960 --> 48:39.918
Catherine is very gentle and kind.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.155
Talk to her and you'll see.

48:44.200 --> 48:47.158
You have the power. You are in charge.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.551
I know you can feel love and compassion.

48:54.960 --> 48:58.635
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

48:58.760 --> 49:02.150
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

49:02.280 --> 49:07.308
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.

49:07.440 --> 49:09.431
You have that power.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.551
Please.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.557
My daughter is Catherine.

49:13.680 --> 49:17.355
Boy, that's smart.
Jesus, that's really smart.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.630
She keeps repeating the name.

49:19.760 --> 49:25.437
If he sees Catherine as a person and not
just an object, it's harder to tear her up.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.869
Release my little girl.

49:28.080 --> 49:31.390
You're coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

49:31.520 --> 49:35.274
and refusing to share information
with me for the third time.

49:35.400 --> 49:39.518
Sir, I told you, this is just a routine
follow-up on the Raspail case.

49:39.640 --> 49:42.996
- He is my patient. I have rights.
- I understand that, sir.

49:43.120 --> 49:47.477
Look, I am not just
some turnkey, Miss Starling.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.438
This is the number
for the US attorney's office.

49:51.560 --> 49:56.680
Either you discuss this with him or you
let me do my job, do you understand?

50:00.280 --> 50:06.389
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,

50:06.520 --> 50:08.875
the senator promises you a transfer

50:09.000 --> 50:13.073
to the VA hospital at Oneida Park, New
York, with a view of the woods nearby.

50:13.200 --> 50:16.078
Maximum security still applies, of course.

50:16.200 --> 50:19.351
You'd have reasonable access to books.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.630
Best of all, though,

50:21.760 --> 50:25.719
one week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital

50:25.840 --> 50:27.796
and go here.

50:30.440 --> 50:33.113
Plum Island.

50:33.240 --> 50:37.756
Every day of that week you may walk on
the beach, you may swim in the ocean,

50:37.880 --> 50:42.351
for up to one hour, under SWAT team
surveillance, of course.

50:43.040 --> 50:45.395
And there you have it.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.796
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.595
A copy of the senator's offer.

50:54.720 --> 50:58.474
This offer is non-negotiable and final.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.558
Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.

51:10.880 --> 51:14.270
''Plum Island Animal Disease
Research Centre.''

51:16.960 --> 51:19.110
Sounds charming.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.710
That's only a part of the island.
There's a very nice beach.

51:22.840 --> 51:26.310
- Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
- Terns?

51:28.200 --> 51:31.237
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be ''turns'' with us too.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.318
Quid pro quo. I tell you things,
you tell me things.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.079
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.

51:37.200 --> 51:40.112
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

51:42.520 --> 51:45.910
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.

51:47.080 --> 51:49.275
Go, Doctor.

51:49.400 --> 51:52.039
What is your worst memory of childhood?

51:53.920 --> 51:56.275
The death of my father.

51:56.400 --> 51:59.312
Tell me about it and don't lie, or I'll know.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.316
He was a town marshal.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.672
One night he surprised two burglars

52:06.800 --> 52:09.155
coming out the back of a drugstore.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.316
They shot him.

52:12.440 --> 52:14.510
Was he killed outright?

52:14.640 --> 52:18.428
No, he was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.

52:19.680 --> 52:22.433
My mother died when I was very young.

52:24.040 --> 52:28.397
My father had become the whole world to
me, and, when he left me, I had nothing.

52:28.520 --> 52:30.670
I was ten years old.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.993
You're very frank, Clarice.

52:34.120 --> 52:38.750
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.073
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

52:43.200 --> 52:47.591
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?

52:50.320 --> 52:53.551
- Yes.
- Big through the hips? Roomy?

52:53.680 --> 52:56.752
- They all were.
- What else?

52:56.880 --> 53:00.759
She had an object deliberately
inserted into her throat.

53:00.880 --> 53:05.192
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.

53:05.320 --> 53:08.153
Was it a butterfly?

53:08.280 --> 53:10.236
Yes. A moth.

53:11.320 --> 53:16.678
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.519
Why does he place them there, Doctor?

53:19.640 --> 53:23.428
The significance of the moth is change.

53:23.560 --> 53:26.870
Caterpillar into chrysalis, or pupa,

53:27.000 --> 53:29.833
and from thence into beauty.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.793
Our Billy wants to change, too.

53:33.440 --> 53:36.512
There's no correlation between
transsexualism and violence.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.757
- Transsexuals are very passive.
- Clever girl.

53:39.880 --> 53:43.395
You're so close to the way you're
gonna catch him, do you realise that?

53:43.520 --> 53:45.909
No. Tell me why.

53:46.040 --> 53:50.795
After your father's murder you were
orphaned. What happened next?

53:53.320 --> 53:57.791
I don't imagine the answer is
on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.

53:57.920 --> 54:03.278
I lived with my mother's cousin and her
husband in Montana. They had a ranch.

54:03.400 --> 54:06.710
- Was it a cattle ranch?
- Sheep and horses.

54:07.120 --> 54:10.476
- How long did you live there?
- Two months.

54:10.920 --> 54:13.912
- Why so briefly?
- I ran away.

54:14.040 --> 54:17.828
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher
make you perform fellatio?

54:17.960 --> 54:20.394
Did he sodomise you?

54:20.520 --> 54:23.876
No. He was a very decent man.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.515
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

54:28.960 --> 54:33.317
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.

54:33.440 --> 54:36.477
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.

54:36.600 --> 54:40.275
You said that I was very close to the way
we would catch him. What did you mean?

54:40.400 --> 54:43.790
There are three centres for
transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins,

54:43.920 --> 54:47.196
the University of Minnesota
and Columbus Medical Centre.

54:47.320 --> 54:51.916
I wouldn't be surprised if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment at all of them

54:52.040 --> 54:54.315
and been rejected.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.034
On what basis would they reject him?

54:57.160 --> 55:01.517
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.

55:01.640 --> 55:04.473
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.

55:04.600 --> 55:08.593
He was made one through years
of systematic abuse.

55:08.720 --> 55:11.996
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

55:12.120 --> 55:14.793
and he thinks
that makes him a transsexual.

55:14.920 --> 55:18.754
But his pathology is
a thousand times more savage

55:18.880 --> 55:21.235
and more terrifying.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.312
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.

55:28.600 --> 55:34.038
Mister, my family'll pay cash. Whatever
ransom you're asking for, they'll pay it.

55:34.160 --> 55:38.551
It rubs the lotion on its skin
or else it gets the hose again.

55:40.600 --> 55:43.831
Yes, it will, Precious. It will get the hose.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.916
OK, OK.

55:52.000 --> 55:56.755
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges, I promise.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.429
See, my mom is a real important woman.

56:00.560 --> 56:02.676
I guess you already know that.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.872
Now it places the lotion in the basket.

56:06.000 --> 56:07.353
Please!

56:07.920 --> 56:09.876
Please!

56:10.640 --> 56:13.791
I wanna go home, please!

56:13.920 --> 56:16.150
It places the lotion in the basket.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.036
I wanna see my mommy!

56:20.120 --> 56:21.599
Please!

56:21.720 --> 56:23.676
I wanna see my...

56:25.800 --> 56:27.916
I wanna see my mommy.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.955
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!

57:05.440 --> 57:09.228
You still think you're gonna walk
on some beach and see the birdies?

57:09.360 --> 57:11.874
I don't think so.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.389
I called Senator Ruth Martin.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.080
She never heard of any deal with you.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.480
They scammed you, Hannibal.

57:21.760 --> 57:24.035
Stand outside.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.636
And shut the door.

57:33.520 --> 57:37.718
There never was a deal with
Senator Martin, but there is now.

57:37.840 --> 57:42.755
I designed it. Of course, I worked in a few
conditions for my own benefit as well.

57:42.880 --> 57:48.034
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and, if the girl is found in time,

57:48.160 --> 57:53.359
Senator Martin will have you transferred
to the state prison in Tennessee.

57:53.480 --> 57:56.153
Answer me, Hannibal.

57:57.120 --> 58:01.591
You answer me now or, by God,
you'll never leave this cell.

58:03.440 --> 58:05.396
Who is Buffalo Bill?

58:06.520 --> 58:08.795
His first name is Louis.

58:08.920 --> 58:12.196
I'll tell the rest to the senator herself,
but only in Tennessee.

58:12.320 --> 58:15.073
And I have a few conditions of my own.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.471
Clean him up and get him ready to go.

58:20.400 --> 58:23.551
Jack, Hannibal Lecter's
being transferred to Memphis.

58:23.680 --> 58:24.954
Transferred?

58:25.080 --> 58:29.358
Did you have a trainee make a phoney
offer to Lecter in the senator's name?

58:29.480 --> 58:31.516
Yeah, I rolled the dice. I had to.

58:31.640 --> 58:35.553
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.

58:35.680 --> 58:38.478
She's asking him
to take over in Memphis.

58:44.680 --> 58:48.275
MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

59:02.200 --> 59:06.557
Welcome to Memphis. I'm Lieutenant
Boyle. This is Sergeant Patrick.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.671
We'll treat you as good as you treat us.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.793
You be a gentleman, you're gonna
get three hots and a cot.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.799
Sir. You sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.

59:19.240 --> 59:20.639
Where's...?

59:21.720 --> 59:23.676
Here, sir. Use mine.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:12.434
Senator Martin, Dr Hannibal Lecter.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:22.758
Dr Lecter, I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.792
You'll wanna read it before I sign.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.078
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time, bargaining for petty privileges.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.318
Clarice Starling and that awful Jack
Crawford have wasted far too much time.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:40.750
I only pray they haven't
doomed the poor girl.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.836
Let me help you now and I will
trust you when it is all over.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.315
You have my word. Paul?

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.834
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.988
I met him just once. He was referred
to me in April or May 1990

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:59.793
by my patient, Benjamin Raspail.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.990
They were lovers, you see.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:06.033
But Raspail had become very frightened.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.470
Apparently, Louis had
murdered a transient

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.717
and done things with the skin.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.389
We need his address
and a physical description.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:22.036
Tell me, Senator. Did you
nurse Catherine yourself?

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.750
- What?
- Did you breast-feed her?

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.440
- Now, wait a minute.
- Yes, I did.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:31.275
- Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
- You son of a bitch!

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.029
Amputate a man's leg
and he can still feel it tickling.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:40.029
Tell me, Mom, when your little girl
is on the slab, where will it tickle you?

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.752
Take this thing back to Baltimore.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.958
Five foot ten, strongly built,
about 190 pounds.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:50.640
Hair blond, eyes pale blue.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.992
He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived
in Philadelphia but may have lied.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.831
That's all I can remember, Mom, but if
I think of any more, I will let you know.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.230
And, Senator, just one more thing.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.954
Love your suit.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.437
In a meeting this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.552
Dr Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.513
of trying to find the abductor, Buffalo Bill.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.279
- How do you fit in?
- My insight into Lecter's mind

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.710
- made this breakthrough possible.
- Buffalo Bill's real name?

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.196
That is now a matter of record
with the proper authorities.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.915
- My name is Dr Frederick Chilton.
- How do you spell that?

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:39.071
- Are you with Dr Chilton's group?
- Well, I just saw him outside, sir.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:42.476
Access to Lecter is limited.
We've been getting death threats.

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:44.955
I understand, sir.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.435
Log in and check your weapon.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.754
I can't take all the credit.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.792
people at the FBI, folks
at the Baltimore state hospital.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.151
And now for the hard part:
apprehending the suspect.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.750
Excuse me, folks.
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.991
Is it true what they're sayin'?

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.910
He's some kind of vampire?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.032
They don't have a name for what he is.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.469
You do know the rules, ma'am?

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.229
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.236
Go ahead.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.150
Good evening, Clarice.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.234
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.154
Just until you get your view.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.840
How very thoughtful.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.073
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.714
before you're both booted off the case?

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.479
No, I came because I wanted to.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.709
People will say we're in love.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.154
Anthrax Island.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:54.238
That was an especially
nice touch, Clarice.

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:56.999
- Yours?
- Yes.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.190
Yeah.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.949
That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.594
Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.792
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:10.956
Louis Friend?

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:14.072
Iron sulfide, also known as fool's gold.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.234
Oh, Clarice, your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.555
You were telling me the truth back in
Baltimore, sir. Please continue now.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:26.353
I've read the case files. Have you?

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.392
Everything you need to find him
is there in those pages.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.116
- Then tell me how.
- First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:39.155
Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each
particular thing, ask what is it in itself?

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.271
What is its nature?

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.154
What does he do, this man you seek?

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:50.798
- He kills women.
- No. That is incidental.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.675
What is the first thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.156
Anger.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.956
Social acceptance.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.432
- Sexual frustrations.
- No. He covets.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.512
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.158
Do we seek out things to covet?

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.236
Make an effort to answer now.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:20.874
No. We just...

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.197
No, we begin by coveting
what we see every day.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.471
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.431
And don't your eyes seek out
the things you want?

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.668
All right, yes. Now please tell me how...

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.509
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.677
You don't have any more
vacations to sell.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.314
Why did you leave that ranch?

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:48.433
Doctor, we don't have
any more time for any of this now.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.028
But we don't reckon time
the same way, do we?

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:55.312
- This is all the time you'll ever have.
- Later. Listen to me. We've only got five...

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.637
No. I will listen now.

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.678
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.349
You went to live with cousins on
a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.436
And?

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:12.716
And one morning I just ran away.

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.916
Not ''just'', Clarice. What set you off?

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:20.510
- You started at what time?
- Early. Still dark.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.428
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.594
I heard a strange noise.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:30.631
What was it?

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.832
It was screaming.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:38.952
Some kind of screaming.
Like a child's voice.

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:40.957
What did you do?

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:43.594
I went downstairs.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.676
Outside.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:49.719
I crept up into the barn.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.549
I was so scared to look inside,
but I had to.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.151
What did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.830
Lambs.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.951
They were screaming.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.719
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.032
And they were screaming.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.836
- And you ran away?
- No. First I tried to free them.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.555
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:21.229
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.272
But you could - and you did, didn't you?

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:27.948
Yes. I took one lamb
and I ran away as fast as I could.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.198
- Where were you going, Clarice?
- I don't know. I didn't have any food,

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.470
any water and it was very cold, very cold.

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.470
I thought...

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.558
I thought if I could save just one, but...

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.388
He was so heavy.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.475
So heavy.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.676
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.595
The rancher was so angry, he sent me
to live at the orphanage in Bozeman.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.870
I never saw the ranch again.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:09.913
What became of your lamb, Clarice?

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:15.469
- He killed him.
- You still wake up sometimes, don't you?

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.988
Wake up in the dark

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.759
and hear the screaming of the lambs?

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:23.276
Yes.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.959
And you think, if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.149
You think if Catherine lives,

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:33.511
you won't wake up in the dark ever again

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.359
to that awful screaming of the lambs.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:38.832
I don't know.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.277
I don't know.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.316
Thank you, Clarice.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.238
- Thank you.
- Tell me his name, Doctor.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.793
Dr Chilton, I presume.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.275
I think you know each other.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.636
OK.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.790
- Let's go.
- It's your turn, Doctor.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:09.911
- Out.
- Tell me his name.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.999
Sorry, ma'am. I've got orders. I have
to put you on a plane. Come on now.

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.315
Brave Clarice.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.876
You will let me know when those lambs
stop screaming, won't you?

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.357
- Tell me his name, Doctor.
- Clarice.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.074
Your case file.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.719
Goodbye, Clarice.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:39.679
- Ready when you are, doc.
- Just another minute, please.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.797
Son of a bitch demanded a second
dinner. Lamb chops, extra rare.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.550
I wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:21.515
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- OK, doc. Grab some floor.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.596
Same drill as before, please.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.833
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:50.156
OK.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.836
Hand me that, would ya?

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.876
Thanks.

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.393
Mind the drawings, please.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.476
Thank you.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.754
Watch it. He's cuffed me!

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.996
Jesus Christ!

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.713
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:16.471
What is this shit?

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.355
- Did somebody go up on five?
- No. Nobody went up.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.472
Call Pembry. Ask him to tell...

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.913
CP. Shots fired on five.
Repeat: shots fired on five.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.996
Sergeant Tate.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.514
- Holy shit.
- What the hell...?

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.188
Shut up. Bobby, get the vest.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.039
- Right, sarge.
- Brady, Howard, cover...

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.116
Look!

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.278
- It's stopped.
- Seal off a ten-block radius.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.039
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.037
We're goin' up.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.311
Pembry!

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.196
Boyle!

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.270
Oh, God.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.156
Go.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:00.832
- Clear.
- Command post.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.315
Two officers down.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.672
- Lecter's gone, sarge.
- Prisoner is missing.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.078
- Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
- Repeat: Lecter is missing and armed.

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.398
He's stripped the bed. Might be
makin' a rope. Check all windows.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.309
Where the fuck is my ambulance?

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:23.959
He's alive. Sergeant Tate, he's alive.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.716
Get a hold of him
and feel his hand. Talk to him.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:31.469
- What do I say?
- It's Jim Pembry. Talk to him, dammit!

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.796
Lecter is missing and armed.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.036
Pembry, can you hear me?

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.870
He took Boyle's gun. Pembry got off one
round. There's a chance Lecter was hit.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.675
Keep breathin' in and out.
That's it. You're doing a good job.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:48.075
You look real good.

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.953
Yeah, you look real good.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.037
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.116
Let's go.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.993
Looking good, Pembry. You're gonna
make it. You're doin' just fine.

01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:27.429
I need that IV now!

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.473
Can we get the straps?
Where's the fucking oxygen?

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.955
Stay with me. Stay with me here.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.315
We're losin' him. Downstairs.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.388
And up.

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.476
Elevator!

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.592
CP to Tate.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:52.473
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.433
I'm on the elevator
bringing Pembry down.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:57.949
He seems to be hangin' on.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:00.469
Top three floors secured.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.556
Main stairwell secured.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.516
We think he's on two.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.355
Tate, are you still with me?

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:26.948
We're pretty sure he's somewhere on two,
sir. That's all for now. Over.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.235
He's on the roof of the elevator.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.671
OK, guys.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.439
I see him.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.755
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.239
- One warning: we need him alive.
- Got it.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.993
Lecter, put your hands on your head.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:22.796
One in the leg.

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.950
No movement.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.512
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're comin' into the car.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.835
We're openin' the hatch.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.032
Watch his hands.
If there's any fire, it'll come from us.

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.151
- Affirm.
- Got it.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.156
Memphis General, medical unit 26.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:17.512
We're inbound with a male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.

01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:22.077
Weapon unknown. We've got grand mal
seizure activity but he's post-ictal now.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.033
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:27.469
- 90?
- Yeah, that's right, 90. Pulse 94.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:32.355
We got him on lactated Ringer's and
the patient is on ten litres of oxygen...

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.113
They found the ambulance in a parking
garage at the airport. Crew was dead.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:48.155
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.677
- By now he could be anywhere.
- He won't come after me.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.995
- Oh, really?
- He won't.

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.477
I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.309
- It's over. She's dead.
- It's not your fault it worked out like this.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:06.672
The thing is that Lecter said everything
we need to catch him is in these pages.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:09.189
Dr Lecter said a lot of things.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.675
He's here, Ardelia.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.395
Is this Lecter's handwriting?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.032
''Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites seem desperately random,

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.835
like the elaboration of a bad liar?
Hannibal Lecter.''

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:53.554
Desperately random?
What does he mean?

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.992
Not random at all, maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.

01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.192
But there is no pattern
or the computers would have nailed it.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.757
- They were even found in random order.
- Random because of the one girl.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:09.714
- The one he weighted down.
- Fredrica Bimmel.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.077
From Belvedere, Ohio.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.033
First girl taken, third body found.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:18.958
- Why?
- She didn't drift. He weighted her down.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:22.311
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:27.389
- Simplicity.
- What does this guy do? He covets.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.954
How do we first start to covet?

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.596
- We covet what we see...
- Every day.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.591
- Hot damn, Clarice.
- He knew her.

01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:46.629
BELVEDERE, OHIO

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.596
- Mr Bimmel?
- That's me.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.188
I'm Clarice Starling. I'm with the FBI.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.396
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr Bimmel.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.670
I don't know nothin' new to tell ya.

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.076
Police been back here
so many times already.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.193
Fredrica went into Chicago
on the bus to see about a job.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.710
She left the interview OK.
She never come home.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:21.789
Her bedroom's how she left it.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.434
Upstairs. Door to the left.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:06.710
He's making himself a ''woman suit'',
Mr Crawford, out of real women.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.274
He can sew, this guy. He's very skilled.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.675
- He's a tailor or a dressmaker.
- Starling...

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.270
That's why they're so big. He has to
keep them alive so he can starve them,

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.915
- so that he can loosen their skin.
- Starling, we know who he is.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.031
And where he is.
We're on our way right now.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.993
- Where?
- Calumet City, edge of Chicago.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.759
Be on the ground in 45 minutes.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.996
That's great news, sir, but how...

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.556
Johns Hopkins came up with some
names. We fed 'em into Known Offenders.

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:36.593
Subject's name
is Jamie Gumb, a.k.a John Grant.

01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.270
Lecter's description was accurate.
He just lied about the name.

01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.550
Customs had some paper on him.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.993
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX. Live caterpillars from Surinam.

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.918
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.233
Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
I'll be there in...

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.592
No, Starling. There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.599
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl.
See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.836
Yes, sir, you bet. I'll do my best.

01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:08.475
Starling, we wouldn't
have found him without you.

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.956
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.875
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr Crawford.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.433
Mr Crawford?

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.835
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.315
I got a better idea.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.073
OK, Precious. Time for a little treat.

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.196
Precious!

01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.474
Come on, girl!

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.989
Come on, Precious.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.677
Come on, Precious!

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.873
I got a yummy snack for ya!
Come on. Come and get it.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.630
Precious!

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.910
Are you up there, you little shit?

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.514
Come and get it, pretty girl.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.395
Precious, please come. Come on.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.599
Would you fuck me?

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.150
Come on. Take that bone.

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.788
I'd fuck me.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.795
Come on.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.596
I'd fuck me hard.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.676
I'd fuck me so hard.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:45.275
No.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.592
AIR NATIONAL GUARD HQ
CHICAGO, IL

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:47.635
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.796
I mean, better places than this?

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.715
Sometimes you do.

01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:58.072
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:02.079
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.873
She thought it was such hot shit.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.355
What did she know? Big dummy.

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:13.191
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:16.155
- How about John Grant?
- No.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.999
Would she have had a friend
you didn't know about?

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:21.270
If she had a guy,
I'd have known, believe me.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.154
- Sewing was her life.
- Did you two ever work together?

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:30.229
Sure. Me and Pam Malavesi used to help
her do alterations for old Mrs Lippman.

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.830
Can you give me Mrs Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:37.869
CALUMET CITY, IL

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.678
So powerful. So beautiful.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.956
Precious?

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.111
- Precious?
- She's down here, you sack of shit!

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.878
- Put her in that bucket.
- Get me a telephone and lower it down.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.230
Poodlie-poo. Precious.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:41.751
- Darling heart, are you all right?
- She's in a lot of pain. She needs a vet.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.752
She broke her leg
on the way down. I know it.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.589
- Don't you hurt my dog!
- Don't you make me hurt your dog!

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.836
You don't know what pain is!

01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:11.912
- Oh, fuck!
- You better be gettin' me that telephone!

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.595
I'm gonna do it, mister!

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.551
All right, mister! I'm doin' it!

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.876
OK, I'm coming.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.596
We're goin' in.

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.156
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs Lippman's family.

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.268
FBI! Everybody down!

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:02.868
No, Lippmans don't live here any more.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.150
Excuse me.
I really need to speak with you.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.992
Clear!

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.756
What's the problem, officer?

01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.519
I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.315
There's no one here, Jack.

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.989
Clarice.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.759
- Your name is?
- Jack Gordon.

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.829
Mr Gordon. Good. Well, Fredrica used to
work for Mrs Lippman. Did you know her?

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.791
No. Uh-uh.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.512
Oh, wait.

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.710
Was she a great, big, fat person?

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:40.876
- She was a big girl, sir.
- Yeah, I may have...

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.389
No, I read about her in the newspaper.

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:47.714
Mrs Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.673
I got his card here someplace.
Come in while I look for it.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:53.155
- May I?
- Yeah, sure.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.636
Are you close to catchin'
somebody, you think?

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.716
Yes. We may be.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.869
Did you take over this place
after Mrs Lippman died, is that right?

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.952
Yeah, I bought this house two years ago.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.430
Did she leave any records?
Any business records?

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.711
Tax forms? List of employees?

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.035
No, nothin' like that at all.

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.718
Say, has the FBI learned something?

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:49.515
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:03.951
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.036
No.

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.516
No, we don't.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.955
Here's that number.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.229
Very good, Mr Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.996
Sure, you can use my phone.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.312
Freeze! Put your hands over your head.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.912
And turn around. Spread your legs.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.437
Spread your legs.
Put your hands in the back. Thumbs up.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.516
Freeze!

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:22.274
Hello? Are you there?

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.675
I'm down here!

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.240
- Catherine Martin?
- Yes!

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.119
FBI. You're safe.

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:54.595
Safe, shit! Get me outta here!

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:12.877
- You're all right. Where is he?
- How the fuck should I know?

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:16.959
- Just get me outta here!
- You gotta be quiet. Shut that dog up.

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.831
Just get me outta here!

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.796
Oh, my God.

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.393
Catherine, I'm gonna get you outta there,
but right now you listen to me.

01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.670
I've gotta leave this room. Be right back.

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:34.475
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fuckin' bitch!

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:38.309
Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fuckin' crazy!

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.037
Please!

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.833
I gotta get outta here!

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:52.871
Catherine, the other officers'll
be here any minute now.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.788
Wait! Don't go! Please!

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.114
Quiet!

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.078
- You OK?
- Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm OK.

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.395
How did you track Buffalo Bill here?

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.476
Clarice M Starling.

01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.156
Congratulations.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:41.436
Special Agent Starling.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.074
- Special Agent Mapp.
- Phone call.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.156
- Excuse me.
- Starling.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.355
Pilch, could you take our picture?

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.436
Yeah. Sure.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.232
Look, I just wanted
to say congratulations.

01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.909
I'm not much good at this kinda thing,
so I'm gonna duck outta here.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.996
OK. Sure.

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.275
Thank you, Mr Crawford.

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:16.352
Your father would have been proud today.

01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.795
Don't forget your phone call.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:27.638
- Starling.
- Well, Clarice?

01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:30.555
Have the lambs stopped screaming?

01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:33.235
- Dr Lecter.
- Don't bother with the trace.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.157
I won't be on long enough.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.639
- Where are you, Dr Lecter?
- I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.

01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.593
The world's more interesting
with you in it.

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:48.632
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.

01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:51.115
You know I can't make that promise.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.835
I do wish we could chat longer but...

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:57.953
I'm having an old friend for dinner.

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:01.554
- Bye.
- Dr Lecter?

01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.396
Dr Lecter?

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.793
Excuse me. You got
the security system all set up?

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.959
- We have the big-shot security.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
