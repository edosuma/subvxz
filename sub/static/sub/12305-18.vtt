WEBVTT

01:29.900 --> 01:30.859
What are you doing?

01:30.901 --> 01:32.653
You cut me off, bitch.

01:32.695 --> 01:34.488
You trying to get us both killed?

01:34.530 --> 01:36.657
Nope. Just you.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.360
Horatio?

02:54.902 --> 02:56.862
Driver's name is Jeff Lanier.

02:56.904 --> 02:58.739
We had reports of arguing,

02:58.822 --> 03:00.157
Cars racing.

03:00.616 --> 03:02.159
Then the road opened up.

03:02.618 --> 03:05.079
You say the road opened up, Frank.

03:05.204 --> 03:06.872
Yeah, it appears to be
some sort of a sinkhole,

03:06.914 --> 03:08.374
which makes it a traffic incident.

03:08.415 --> 03:10.584
We can turn it over
to patrol, if you want.

03:13.295 --> 03:14.254
Frank,

03:14.588 --> 03:16.882
I see light under the car.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.677
I think there's a tunnel down there.

03:19.802 --> 03:23.222
Nobody digs tunnels in Miami.
The water table's too high.

03:23.681 --> 03:24.848
If they did,

03:24.890 --> 03:26.600
where the hell is it headed?

03:27.017 --> 03:29.436
There's only one way to find out.

03:37.403 --> 03:38.696
Cash on the ground.

03:38.737 --> 03:39.989
Bank across the street.

03:40.114 --> 03:44.076
Looks like our driver stumbled
onto a bank robbery, Frank.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.371
We're over here.

03:48.664 --> 03:50.666
Cave-in blocked any escape route.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.627
Robbers must have climbed out
through the hole in the street.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.671
Not everyone, Frank.

03:56.505 --> 03:59.883
I can't think why she'd be in this
tunnel unless she was in on the robbery.

04:00.384 --> 04:02.177
Maybe they left her behind.

04:02.303 --> 04:04.179
You go, Frank.

04:07.808 --> 04:09.685
Take a look at this.

04:12.313 --> 04:14.982
Tunnel must have collapsed
during the bank robbery.

04:15.482 --> 04:18.902
Like divine intervention.

05:12.524 --> 05:14.151
Bank robbery?

05:14.193 --> 05:15.778
But no alarms went off.

05:15.903 --> 05:19.073
As branch manager, I would
have been the first notified.

05:19.198 --> 05:21.575
Look, right now, we have more
questions than answers, all right?

05:21.700 --> 05:23.285
Do you know this woman?

05:23.786 --> 05:24.870
Oh, my god.

05:24.912 --> 05:25.954
That's Lori.

05:25.996 --> 05:28.165
Lori Stoltz, my assistant manager.

05:28.207 --> 05:29.166
She was killed,

05:29.291 --> 05:31.543
and we have reason to believe that
she was involved in the robbery.

05:31.585 --> 05:32.836
No. Impossible.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.255
Lori was one of my
most trusted employees.

05:35.297 --> 05:36.548
Did she have access to the vault?

05:36.590 --> 05:38.592
I've got the only master key.

05:39.385 --> 05:41.178
But Lori knew the security codes.

05:41.303 --> 05:43.597
So she could have disabled the alarms.

05:53.315 --> 05:55.025
I know this is difficult,

05:55.192 --> 05:56.944
but we really need your cooperation.

05:56.985 --> 05:58.737
I'm gonna need to see
this with my own eyes.

05:58.821 --> 06:00.072
Fine, let's go.

06:04.993 --> 06:06.870
I don't believe this.

06:08.288 --> 06:10.416
My vault is impenetrable.

06:16.296 --> 06:18.048
How did he get in there?

06:23.595 --> 06:25.556
I think what the robbers did.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.918
Check the security system.

07:01.717 --> 07:03.510
Lori's code was the last entered.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.346
She did disarm the security system.

07:05.387 --> 07:08.515
All right, we'll need the name of
every safe deposit box owner on record.

07:08.599 --> 07:10.392
Our clients are Miami's elite.

07:10.434 --> 07:11.643
They require discretion.

07:11.685 --> 07:13.395
That's fine. Then be discrete.

07:13.687 --> 07:15.189
I'll do what I can.

07:23.822 --> 07:27.701
Each one of these safe deposit
boxes requires two keys to open.

07:28.911 --> 07:31.246
We've got an electronic detonator here.

07:31.288 --> 07:34.708
That and some plastic explosives
would have gotten the boxes open.

07:41.006 --> 07:43.550
That's also how they
blew a hole in the wall.

07:43.592 --> 07:46.095
Why would the bank robbers
leave all this cash?

07:46.804 --> 07:48.681
Because I don't think

07:48.889 --> 07:50.808
they were after cash.

08:06.407 --> 08:09.493
That's a very confident stride
for somebody who's late to work.

08:09.618 --> 08:10.577
I know. I'm very sorry,

08:10.619 --> 08:13.998
but I had to stop and pick up a
little addition to my wardrobe.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.917
You got your gun qualification.

08:17.292 --> 08:19.378
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

08:19.503 --> 08:20.671
Now I can back you up for a change.

08:20.713 --> 08:21.964
I can use it.

08:22.715 --> 08:23.465
So, catch me up.

08:23.507 --> 08:25.092
What have we got? Did
you find the, uh...

08:25.134 --> 08:25.884
the tunnel entrance?

08:26.010 --> 08:28.679
No, but this site is
200 meters from the bank.

08:28.804 --> 08:30.848
Perfect place to hide in plain site.

08:30.889 --> 08:32.890
Okay. Well, let's get started.
Let's see what we find.

08:33.017 --> 08:33.976
Great.

08:49.324 --> 08:50.367
Hey, I've got some drag marks.

08:50.409 --> 08:51.368
Will you help me?

08:51.493 --> 08:52.286
Yeah.

09:12.598 --> 09:13.599
Well...

09:13.891 --> 09:16.101
I think we found our tunnel entrance.

09:16.310 --> 09:17.186
Yup.

09:17.311 --> 09:19.480
And maybe where they left.

09:19.521 --> 09:20.481
Look at the tire treads.

09:20.522 --> 09:22.483
Too narrow to be from
a construction vehicle.

09:22.524 --> 09:24.401
Could be from a getaway car.

09:29.823 --> 09:31.158
This is an active construction site.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.786
Somebody had to have seen
something, don't you think?

09:33.911 --> 09:35.287
Yes, I do.

09:37.498 --> 09:38.999
Excuse me? Are you the foreman?

09:39.500 --> 09:40.417
That's right.

09:40.501 --> 09:41.377
Keith Farrell.

09:41.585 --> 09:44.630
Were you aware that there was a bank
robbery across the street this morning?

09:44.713 --> 09:48.550
And that the robbers got in through a
tunnel built on your construction site?

09:48.801 --> 09:51.136
You don't think one of my guys
had anything to do with it?

09:51.220 --> 09:52.012
Well, I don't know.

09:52.054 --> 09:53.931
You're the foreman.
You expect me to believe

09:54.014 --> 09:57.226
that you had no idea there was a tunnel
being built right under your nose?

09:57.309 --> 09:58.894
There was a woman that
was killed in that tunnel.

09:59.019 --> 10:00.771
Hey, it's got nothing to do with me.

10:00.813 --> 10:02.147
Look, I'm on a breakneck schedule here.

10:02.189 --> 10:04.316
I've only got seven months
to put this tower up.

10:04.358 --> 10:05.776
What exactly are you building?

10:05.859 --> 10:07.861
New headquarters for Amanda's Orchards.

10:07.903 --> 10:09.238
Look, I'm in charge of 50 guys.

10:09.279 --> 10:10.531
I don't have time for this.

10:10.614 --> 10:12.908
Okay, well, as long as you know
that if you're covering for somebody,

10:12.991 --> 10:14.243
it's gonna come back on you.

10:14.284 --> 10:15.911
You two gonna charge me with something?

10:15.994 --> 10:17.162
Because if not,

10:17.287 --> 10:18.789
I got concrete to pour.

10:19.498 --> 10:21.375
Well, we may be back for a visit.

10:38.517 --> 10:41.061
So are these the safe deposit
boxes from the bank vault?

10:41.103 --> 10:43.063
Yeah, just the ones that
were opened and emptied.

10:43.105 --> 10:45.482
Well, let's hope whoever
emptied them left a print.

10:45.607 --> 10:47.067
Yeah, let's hope so.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.404
Certainly got your work
cut out for you here.

10:51.905 --> 10:53.365
We have our work cut out for us, pal.

10:53.490 --> 10:55.534
That half right there... that's yours.

10:55.617 --> 10:56.994
Get started.

11:43.207 --> 11:44.667
Well, we sure do got a lot of prints,

11:44.750 --> 11:47.169
but we don't have a lot
of people on file, do we?

11:47.294 --> 11:48.295
No.

11:48.712 --> 11:50.464
We've got five suspects to work with.

11:50.589 --> 11:52.800
Let me run it against the
list of safe deposit box owners

11:52.925 --> 11:54.259
that we got from the bank.

12:00.307 --> 12:02.476
Two civil employees. Two military.

12:02.601 --> 12:04.395
What about this guy?

12:05.187 --> 12:06.480
Carlos Santiago.

12:06.522 --> 12:09.274
He was arrested on a minor
drug possession charge.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.776
Yeah, I know this name.

12:10.818 --> 12:11.860
Swims with the big fish.

12:11.902 --> 12:13.070
The Hortez cartel.

12:13.112 --> 12:15.823
Got ties to coca leaf farms in Bogota.

12:15.906 --> 12:18.409
Just never been able to sink
him on any cocaine distribution.

12:18.492 --> 12:21.036
Well, his name's not on
the safe deposit box list.

12:21.161 --> 12:22.871
Then why were his prints in the vault?

12:33.298 --> 12:35.092
it's been a long time, Carlos.

12:35.259 --> 12:36.969
It's always something, isn't it, Caine?

12:37.219 --> 12:38.679
This day and age.

12:38.721 --> 12:40.681
Heightened awareness.

12:40.723 --> 12:42.307
Everything questioned.

12:42.599 --> 12:44.393
I mean, a man like me
can't live his life.

12:44.518 --> 12:46.270
Or make an honest living.

12:46.687 --> 12:47.980
I've changed.

12:48.522 --> 12:49.690
I'm an art dealer now.

12:49.732 --> 12:50.983
Very lucrative...

12:51.608 --> 12:52.776
and very legitimate.

12:52.901 --> 12:57.698
We recovered your fingerprint
in the vault at Dade Mutual.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.659
I have a safe deposit box there.

13:01.201 --> 13:02.995
It's listed under my company name.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.372
The bank was robbed
this morning, Carlos.

13:05.497 --> 13:06.874
And a woman was killed.

13:06.915 --> 13:08.542
You know me, Caine.

13:09.001 --> 13:10.377
Bank robbery's not my style.

13:10.419 --> 13:13.422
And neither is telling
the truth, Carlos.

13:14.798 --> 13:17.885
Are you going to tell me you
have nothing to do with this?

13:18.218 --> 13:19.553
Today, lieutenant,

13:19.720 --> 13:22.931
I'm just another dissatisfied
customer of Dade Mutual.

13:23.599 --> 13:24.475
A victim.

13:24.516 --> 13:25.768
A victim

13:25.851 --> 13:27.061
Why is that?

13:27.394 --> 13:30.105
My safe deposit box was robbed, as well.

13:33.817 --> 13:36.320
And you're not going to
tell me what they took,

13:36.487 --> 13:37.363
are you?

13:37.821 --> 13:39.782
You know me, Caine.

13:40.491 --> 13:41.867
I'm helpful.

13:42.409 --> 13:43.660
To a point.

13:43.994 --> 13:44.953
That

13:45.329 --> 13:47.539
is going to change, Carlos.

14:03.507 --> 14:04.883
I got your message. What's up?

14:04.966 --> 14:05.926
I found something.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.844
Thought you should see it right away.

14:07.886 --> 14:09.846
You found a bullet in our tunnel victim?

14:09.930 --> 14:12.891
Fluoroscope caught it
embedded in her rib cage.

14:12.974 --> 14:15.560
It was concealed by
the rest of her trauma.

14:16.686 --> 14:18.105
Looks like a nine mil.

14:18.188 --> 14:19.981
Can it tell us who fired the shot?

14:20.065 --> 14:21.900
It's too distorted for that.

14:21.983 --> 14:23.777
But you know, it does prove one thing.

14:23.902 --> 14:26.697
Our girl was shot before
the tunnel caved in.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.156
The collapse didn't kill her.

14:28.198 --> 14:29.574
She was murdered.

14:40.711 --> 14:43.505
maybe this will help you narrow
the search for her killer.

14:43.714 --> 14:46.007
I found semen in her underwear.

14:46.091 --> 14:48.677
Well, if we're lucky, it'll
give us somebody to talk to.

14:55.976 --> 14:56.852
Charles Brighton.

14:56.893 --> 14:58.562
The Charles Brighton?

14:58.603 --> 15:00.272
Is that the orange juice guy?

15:00.313 --> 15:02.941
Orange juice guy? He's the
gazillionaire behind Amanda's Orchards.

15:02.983 --> 15:04.651
You know, that little girl in the ads,

15:04.693 --> 15:06.319
"squeeze out every drop of goodness. "

15:06.403 --> 15:08.321
We found the entrance to the bank tunnel

15:08.405 --> 15:10.574
at the site of Brighton's
new headquarters.

15:10.615 --> 15:13.160
Sounds like M. Brighton
has a lot to answer for.

15:13.201 --> 15:15.037
Yeah, maybe murder.

15:26.048 --> 15:27.215
Thank you.

15:31.011 --> 15:32.763
Hi, I'm looking for Charles Brighton.

15:32.846 --> 15:34.139
He's not here.

15:34.306 --> 15:35.474
Can I help you?

15:36.308 --> 15:37.934
You must be Amanda.

15:38.477 --> 15:39.770
Do we know each other?

15:39.811 --> 15:40.771
No, I feel like I know you.

15:40.812 --> 15:44.775
I looked at your face on my orange
juice container every morning growing up.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.612
That picture was a lifetime ago.

15:49.404 --> 15:50.364
And you are?

15:50.489 --> 15:52.783
Eric Delko, csi.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.786
It's important that I
speak to your father.

15:55.911 --> 15:57.454
Can I know what this is regarding?

15:57.537 --> 15:59.706
No, I'm sorry. It's
privileged information.

15:59.915 --> 16:02.250
But I thought it was
like we knew each other.

16:04.795 --> 16:06.838
it's not every day that
I get to meet a celebrity,

16:06.880 --> 16:07.881
but, uh...

16:07.964 --> 16:09.257
But what?

16:10.175 --> 16:10.967
Come on.

16:11.009 --> 16:12.469
You can tell me.

16:13.512 --> 16:14.679
You're married.

16:15.013 --> 16:16.098
Oh.

16:16.598 --> 16:18.266
Engaged, actually.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.770
I'm single for two more weeks.

16:26.108 --> 16:27.150
Okay.

16:27.609 --> 16:28.652
Okay,

16:28.902 --> 16:29.861
if you want to talk to my dad,

16:29.903 --> 16:31.988
he's at the company's warehouse.

16:32.114 --> 16:33.949
His home away from home.

16:34.199 --> 16:34.783
Thank you.

16:34.866 --> 16:35.659
Sure.

16:42.499 --> 16:44.793
H, Brighton's at the port.

16:58.014 --> 16:59.099
M. Brighton.

16:59.182 --> 17:00.600
Here you go. Thank you Sir.

17:00.809 --> 17:02.686
I'm Charles Brighton.
How can I help you?

17:02.894 --> 17:04.896
M. Brighton, we wanted
to talk to you about...

17:05.021 --> 17:07.858
a robbery at Dade Mutual this morning.

17:11.486 --> 17:12.863
Well, I don't know anything about that.

17:12.904 --> 17:13.571
Really?

17:13.696 --> 17:17.617
We found your DNA, which suggests
you had sex with one of our suspects.

17:18.910 --> 17:20.871
You recognize that woman?

17:22.204 --> 17:23.373
That's-that's Lori. My god,

17:23.415 --> 17:24.708
what the hell happened to her?

17:24.790 --> 17:26.917
She was killed during the
commission of the robbery.

17:27.002 --> 17:30.464
The thieves entered the
bank from your property.

17:37.387 --> 17:38.638
M. Brighton?

17:41.475 --> 17:43.977
Lori and I started seeing
each other about a month ago.

17:44.102 --> 17:45.353
Where'd you meet her?

17:45.395 --> 17:46.521
She came by my construction site.

17:46.563 --> 17:47.773
She introduced herself.

17:47.814 --> 17:50.108
Said it was "community relations. "

17:50.275 --> 17:51.943
- That's right, right up there
- Okay

17:51.985 --> 17:53.153
Take care of that.

17:57.282 --> 17:58.450
M. Brighton?

17:58.533 --> 17:59.868
I'm Lori Stoltz.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.453
I work across the street at the bank.

18:01.536 --> 18:04.373
I just wanted to introduce myself.

18:05.582 --> 18:08.377
Well, it's-it's, uh, very
nice to meet you, Lori.

18:08.543 --> 18:10.504
The pleasure's mine.

18:15.801 --> 18:17.928
Sounds to me like she
was setting you up.

18:18.303 --> 18:21.932
I can't believe that she would
use my property to rob a bank.

18:22.682 --> 18:25.519
You got to understand, my
wife passed away two years ago.

18:25.602 --> 18:30.190
This... Lori was my first
attempt at having a social life.

18:30.774 --> 18:32.359
I thought she was different.

18:32.401 --> 18:33.443
Different, how?

18:33.485 --> 18:34.569
Well, when you're in my position,

18:34.611 --> 18:36.363
people have a tendency to exploit you.

18:36.488 --> 18:38.156
It's happened before. I just can't...

18:38.198 --> 18:40.534
can't believe i let it happen again.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.164
Look, guys, this is kind of
hard for me to process right now.

18:46.289 --> 18:47.958
If there's anything I can
do I'd be happy to help.

18:47.999 --> 18:48.750
Just say the word.

18:48.792 --> 18:51.086
I may take you up on that, Mr. Brighton.

19:02.222 --> 19:05.434
All right, did you get anything from
the bomb components from the bank vault?

19:05.475 --> 19:09.187
Plenty. I figured out how the robbers
got into the safe deposit boxes.

19:09.354 --> 19:13.066
Our detonator was made out of a
common household group of items.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.651
Breath mint tin, nine-volt battery,

19:14.693 --> 19:16.486
and a lot of electrical wire.

19:16.611 --> 19:17.362
Low tech.

19:17.404 --> 19:18.447
Well, it only looks that way.

19:18.488 --> 19:20.574
It's actually quite sophisticated.

19:20.699 --> 19:23.160
There's a small amount
of plastic explosive

19:23.285 --> 19:26.580
that's attached to the door
of each safe deposit box.

19:26.705 --> 19:30.083
One wire leads to a button, the
other to the firing mechanism.

19:30.292 --> 19:33.086
The device is powered
by the nine-volt battery.

19:33.211 --> 19:34.546
The button is pushed,

19:34.588 --> 19:37.382
the battery sends out a charge...

19:43.180 --> 19:44.556
So we know how the bomb works.

19:44.681 --> 19:47.434
Now we just need to find
out who the bomber is.

19:47.476 --> 19:49.770
Did he leave any sort of signature?

19:49.978 --> 19:51.188
They always do.

19:51.313 --> 19:51.980
Yeah.

19:52.105 --> 19:55.567
Connecting wire wrapped four
times, counterclockwise.

19:55.692 --> 19:58.278
And the detonator's made
out of a breath mint tin.

19:58.403 --> 20:00.155
Does that look familiar to you?

20:00.280 --> 20:01.698
You know what? When I was on patrol,

20:01.782 --> 20:05.285
there was a series of
break-ins in storage lockers.

20:06.787 --> 20:08.789
They used a device similar to this.

20:08.997 --> 20:10.457
Did you ever get an ID?

20:10.499 --> 20:12.250
I could call my old watch commander.

20:12.292 --> 20:14.461
I'm sure the name's
on the list somewhere.

20:18.799 --> 20:21.009
That bomb charge was a long time ago.

20:21.676 --> 20:22.886
Why am I here?

20:24.179 --> 20:26.807
Mr. Mays, we found all
this stuff in your car.

20:27.682 --> 20:28.975
The stuff's all mine.

20:29.101 --> 20:29.684
Yeah, that's funny,

20:29.810 --> 20:32.270
'cause you don't look like a
diamond necklace wearing kind of guy.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.272
- It's for my girl.
- Really?

20:34.398 --> 20:36.149
What about the bearer bonds
and the stock certificates?

20:36.274 --> 20:37.484
Those for your girl, too?

20:37.609 --> 20:39.361
What, a guy can't invest?

20:40.612 --> 20:43.865
Listen, I can test your
hands for bomb-making material.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.450
They'll probably pop positive.

20:45.492 --> 20:48.078
So do us all a favor and tell the truth.

20:49.413 --> 20:50.706
Okay, fine. You got me.

20:50.747 --> 20:52.416
Actually, Freddie, technically,

20:52.499 --> 20:53.667
you got you.

20:53.709 --> 20:54.501
See, uh,

20:54.584 --> 20:57.796
bomb makers are the only criminals
stupid enough to sign their own work.

20:57.838 --> 21:00.257
When you broke into all
those storage lockers

21:00.298 --> 21:03.343
you used the same breath
mint tin as your detonator.

21:15.981 --> 21:16.732
Big deal.

21:16.773 --> 21:18.483
I took a couple of keepsakes.

21:18.525 --> 21:19.568
I can do the time.

21:19.609 --> 21:20.569
What's the problem?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.988
The problem is that you shot
Lori Stoltz in the tunnel.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.573
That wasn't me.

21:26.074 --> 21:27.409
When I got in the tunnel,

21:27.492 --> 21:28.785
she was already dead.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.794
I didn't shoot her, and
I didn't see who did.

21:37.878 --> 21:38.462
Doesn't matter,

21:38.503 --> 21:41.006
'cause if anybody dies
during commission of a felony,

21:41.506 --> 21:42.466
it's felony murder.

21:42.591 --> 21:43.759
So you can either tell us
who you're working with,

21:43.884 --> 21:46.219
or you're the one who's gonna go down.

21:50.015 --> 21:50.974
Okay.

21:51.808 --> 21:53.393
I was part of a crew.

21:54.186 --> 21:55.771
Lori hired me and one other guy.

21:55.812 --> 21:57.856
He's a real loser, name's Dan Kirkland.

22:07.783 --> 22:08.408
All right,

22:08.492 --> 22:11.286
and then you and this guy
got Lori out of the way

22:11.411 --> 22:13.663
so you could split the
loot in half, is that it?

22:13.789 --> 22:15.165
Dan let me keep it all,

22:15.207 --> 22:17.084
except for one thing
he swiped from my bag-

22:17.167 --> 22:18.794
he didn't think I noticed.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.095
Guys, let's get a move on!

22:30.180 --> 22:31.473
What'd he take?

22:31.681 --> 22:33.016
I couldn't make it out.

22:33.183 --> 22:34.851
I don't know what
could be that important.

22:35.102 --> 22:37.479
Obviously om was sitething
worth killing for.

22:37.604 --> 22:38.772
I'll go check it out.

22:43.777 --> 22:44.736
What's that for?

22:44.778 --> 22:46.154
You're gonna write your confession,

22:46.196 --> 22:47.656
and I'll tell you what...

22:48.281 --> 22:49.783
...you can even sign it.

22:57.290 --> 22:59.251
Frank, I'm in front
of Dan Kirkland's house.

22:59.376 --> 23:01.044
Get here as soon as you can.

23:05.674 --> 23:07.050
Dan Kirkland?

23:07.300 --> 23:07.968
Yeah?

23:08.009 --> 23:09.469
Miami-Dade police.

23:09.511 --> 23:10.971
Stop right there.

23:14.474 --> 23:15.767
I asked you to stop!

23:15.809 --> 23:17.769
Hands on your head now!

23:26.987 --> 23:28.280
Not much of a shot.

23:28.321 --> 23:29.573
What else you got?

23:29.906 --> 23:32.617
Why don't you keep moving
around and you'll find out.

23:32.909 --> 23:34.453
- You got him?
- I got him.

23:34.494 --> 23:35.454
You all right, Natalia?

23:35.495 --> 23:36.788
Yep, I'm fine.

23:38.290 --> 23:39.249
Shots fired.

23:39.374 --> 23:42.544
Requesting an ambulance
at 24th and Cordova.

23:42.878 --> 23:45.088
24th and Cordova.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.485
Horatio, I'm really sorry. I...

24:04.610 --> 24:06.570
- I know iab is gonna be all over this.
- Just tell me what happened.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.364
Well, he... I told him to stop.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.365
He reached behind his back.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.949
He started pulling his arms forward...

24:10.991 --> 24:12.743
- Okay, so you were in fear for your life?
- Yes.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.161
Okay, so that's all they get.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.579
What type of a gun did he have?

24:15.704 --> 24:16.580
Colt. 45.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.500
Lori Stoltz was killed by
a nine millimeter, right?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.085
Yeah, so the murder
weapon is still out there.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.796
We also know that Kirkland
took something from the vault.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.589
Whatever it is, I'm going to find it.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.549
- Horatio...
- Now, listen to me.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.552
I don't want you to worry. Okay?

24:33.180 --> 24:34.848
Nice house for a bank robber.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.643
These are all Dan Kirkland's valuables.

24:38.394 --> 24:41.772
How are we gonna figure out which
one of these came from the vault?

24:49.613 --> 24:50.989
Well, the bomber said

24:51.073 --> 24:52.908
that they emptied

24:53.409 --> 24:56.995
the contents of the
safe deposit box, right?

24:58.997 --> 25:00.040
And since he made the bombs,

25:00.082 --> 25:02.918
I guess he's got explosive
trace over everything he touched.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.169
No.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.466
So all we have to do is figure out

25:09.508 --> 25:12.094
which one of these items
has explosive trace on it.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.430
That's absolutely correct.

25:24.982 --> 25:26.066
Negative.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.152
The watch wasn't in the vault?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.153
Yeah.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.665
So...

25:43.917 --> 25:45.836
let's check this video camera.

26:02.186 --> 26:03.854
Eric, this is it.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.355
A disposable video camera...

26:05.397 --> 26:06.982
I mean, that must be worth protecting.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.109
And worth killing for.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.875
Hey, have you downloaded
that footage off the camera?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.627
Yeah. I'm doing it right now.

26:27.878 --> 26:31.298
Okay, so these are the
video and the audio files.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.888
That's Amanda Brighton.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.182
What do you think this is?
Some sort of a home video?

26:40.224 --> 26:41.600
Yeah, it looks like it.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.609
I am in bed with Miami's
number one drug lord.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.735
Oh, wow.

26:52.194 --> 26:55.114
That's Amanda Brighton
and Carlos Santiago in bed.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.533
Look, baby, just tell daddy that,

26:57.700 --> 27:00.452
that I'm a legitimate business owner.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.830
My dad will never know about this.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.373
Ever.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.166
Sure, baby.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.377
Now sell it like you did on tv.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.882
This is Amanda Brighton
for Amanda's Orchards.

27:14.383 --> 27:18.429
Squeeze out every drop of goodness.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.974
Oh, you know you will.

27:22.599 --> 27:24.727
Little, dirty girl.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.982
So Carlos hid this camera
in his safe deposit box.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.401
That's what the entire robbery is about.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.611
Someone went to a lot of
trouble to get this tape.

27:34.695 --> 27:37.031
I better tell Horatio
about this, A.S.A.P.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.075
Be careful with that.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.119
That's my mother's favorite painting.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.290
Lieutenant Caine.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.792
I didn't know you were an art lover.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.711
Speaking of which, Carlos,

27:50.753 --> 27:55.174
you and Amanda Brighton on tape
has become an instant classic.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.301
Little, dirty girl.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.264
That's not meant for public viewing.

28:02.389 --> 28:04.475
Yes, blackmail never is, is it?

28:04.516 --> 28:05.768
Blackmail?

28:06.185 --> 28:08.062
Brighton's never paid me a cent.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.398
There are many forms of currency.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.985
See, now you're reaching, Caine.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.570
And I'm not alone.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.239
I'm impounding your vehicle.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.575
You can't do that.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.786
I just did, Carlos.

28:24.078 --> 28:25.662
Should I call you a cab?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.164
What am I doing here?

28:27.206 --> 28:28.957
I just got out of the hospital.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.542
We found the video camera, Dan.

28:30.584 --> 28:34.129
We know that you were involved
with the robbery of Dade Mutual.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.382
I don't know what you're talking about.

28:36.465 --> 28:37.257
Really?

28:37.383 --> 28:38.759
We have additional evidence

28:38.801 --> 28:40.969
that puts you inside the tunnel.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.513
Hospital sent over your clothes.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.972
We found trace amounts of sediment

28:44.014 --> 28:46.058
that matched the crime scene.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.352
Okay.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.271
Okay, Lori Stoltz.

28:51.814 --> 28:53.482
She hired me to dig the tunnel.

29:00.114 --> 29:00.948
There it is.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.366
We've reached the vault.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.659
Get your gear, Freddie.

29:03.701 --> 29:04.952
We're ready for you.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.376
What was your take?

29:12.501 --> 29:14.628
She said we could keep
anything we could grab.

29:14.712 --> 29:16.588
All she wanted was that video camera.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.840
I knew that it

29:17.881 --> 29:19.466
had to be valuable.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.477
Guys, let's get a move on!

29:34.815 --> 29:36.358
And then Lori found out
you swiped the camera,

29:36.400 --> 29:37.568
so you shot her?

29:37.651 --> 29:39.278
I didn't shoot anybody.

29:39.486 --> 29:42.281
Lori paid me to dig a hole. Okay?

29:42.406 --> 29:43.490
And I dug it.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.867
Well, that tunnel

29:44.908 --> 29:46.785
collapsed on a man and killed him.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.162
That's on your head.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.668
I've got nothing else to say.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.379
And I would like a lawyer.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.724
Dan just confirmed that Lori
was after the video camera.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.392
And she was killed for it.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.852
It had to be someone

30:11.894 --> 30:16.023
who had a lot to gain or lose
from having that videotape.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.278
Come on. You can tell me.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.616
You know, Amanda Brighton

30:25.657 --> 30:28.369
had on a pretty large engagement
ring when I talked to her.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.080
Then I think it's time we
talked to america's sweetheart.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.040
If you wanted to see me again,

30:33.082 --> 30:35.250
you could have just come by the house.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.172
You've been keeping
a few secrets, Amanda.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.840
Like what?

30:41.882 --> 30:43.759
Like bank robbery, for starters.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.594
Bank robbery?

30:46.095 --> 30:47.971
Why would I rob a bank?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.473
I'm a Brighton.

30:50.099 --> 30:52.059
Does the name Carlos
Santiago ring a bell?

30:54.978 --> 30:56.355
What about him?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.774
We have a videotape of
the two of you together,

30:58.816 --> 31:00.693
in very clear resolution.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.569
He taped that?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.489
Oh, god...

31:06.699 --> 31:08.492
that was just a one-time thing.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.661
Apparently Carlos wanted
your "one-time thing"

31:11.495 --> 31:13.330
to last for all time.

31:14.415 --> 31:15.416
Look...

31:15.791 --> 31:17.042
that was two years ago.

31:17.084 --> 31:20.671
I was going through a
really difficult time.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.507
- My mother had just died.
- And you met Carlos.

31:23.549 --> 31:24.967
I was self-destructing, and...

31:25.008 --> 31:28.011
he was there to pick up the pieces.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.763
It was a mistake.

31:33.392 --> 31:34.935
If my fiancé finds out...

31:34.977 --> 31:36.353
That's why you stole the videotape?

31:36.395 --> 31:37.646
To save your upcoming marriage?

31:37.688 --> 31:40.065
No, I had nothing to
do with this robbery.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.985
We found tire tread marks near the bank.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.987
So we're going to have
to impound your car.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.155
You can have it.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.865
Really, I'll do anything I can to help.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.075
I was not involved in this.

31:50.284 --> 31:52.286
Well, I hope for your sake you're right.

32:24.070 --> 32:26.447
Did you get anything from
Carlos Santiago's rolls?

32:26.781 --> 32:28.657
Yeah, I ran the specs
from his tires against

32:28.699 --> 32:30.242
the treads you found at
the construction site.

32:30.284 --> 32:31.452
I got no match.

32:31.494 --> 32:33.120
So, he wasn't at the tunnel entrance.

32:33.162 --> 32:36.248
No. I'm about to run the
treads on Amanda Brighton's car.

32:36.791 --> 32:38.376
Think maybe amanda
took that video camera

32:38.417 --> 32:39.960
'cause she was embarrassed?

32:40.294 --> 32:42.129
I would if I was her.

32:47.468 --> 32:48.552
We got a match.

32:48.594 --> 32:50.262
It puts Amanda's car at the scene.

32:50.346 --> 32:51.931
Think we can put Amanda in the car?

32:51.972 --> 32:54.308
I haven't had a chance
to process it yet.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.811
Why don't I help you get started?

33:06.570 --> 33:09.615
Man, this thing's as clean on
the inside as it is on the outside.

33:09.699 --> 33:11.909
A little too clean, if you ask me.

33:16.163 --> 33:18.249
I think I might have something.

33:34.765 --> 33:37.184
It's got an amber sheen to it.

33:39.562 --> 33:41.022
And a pretty bad odor.

33:41.063 --> 33:42.648
Think it's some sort of oil?

33:44.066 --> 33:45.276
I don't know.

33:45.484 --> 33:47.319
Let me get it to trace myself.

33:47.403 --> 33:49.196
This could prove Amanda's lying.

34:15.764 --> 34:16.474
hey.

34:16.599 --> 34:19.476
What kind of trace did you
get amanda brighton's car?

34:20.061 --> 34:23.188
Got kerosene and paraffinic
petroleum distillates.

34:23.272 --> 34:25.232
Kerosene explains the strong odor.

34:25.274 --> 34:27.443
Yeah, but that could be used
for any number of cleaners,

34:27.485 --> 34:29.027
solvents, coatings.

34:29.070 --> 34:32.114
This combination is water insoluble.

34:33.366 --> 34:35.034
It acts as a barrier between surfaces,

34:35.076 --> 34:37.661
sort of like an
industrial cooking spray.

34:37.745 --> 34:39.538
Yeah, but where would that be useful?

34:40.664 --> 34:42.041
Construction site

34:42.166 --> 34:44.043
where concrete's being poured.

34:57.390 --> 34:58.766
you know, Natalia and I saw the foreman

34:58.849 --> 35:02.061
pouring concrete today nowhere
near the entrance of the tunnel.

35:02.103 --> 35:03.020
If Amanda's the killer,

35:03.062 --> 35:05.606
why would she not leave the
tunnel and go directly to her car?

35:05.690 --> 35:07.108
Why the stopover?

35:07.274 --> 35:08.442
My guess?

35:08.567 --> 35:10.236
Dispose of the murder weapon.

35:16.992 --> 35:18.744
Shut it off, mr. Farrell.

35:22.790 --> 35:23.749
Now what?

35:24.375 --> 35:26.544
Just here for the last
piece of the puzzle.

35:26.585 --> 35:27.670
And what's that?

35:27.795 --> 35:30.715
A murder weapon of the
nine millimeter variety.

35:30.798 --> 35:32.675
I told you pretty clearly the last time.

35:32.758 --> 35:34.593
I don't know nothing about any murder.

35:34.677 --> 35:37.096
Then you shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

35:37.179 --> 35:38.639
Did you pour that concrete?

35:38.681 --> 35:40.015
Yeah. This morning.

35:40.182 --> 35:41.934
Don't even think about tearing it up.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.644
Well, if there's something
down there, we will.

35:43.769 --> 35:47.023
This ground-penetrating radar
will pick up any inconsistencies.

35:47.064 --> 35:48.274
You can't use that.

35:48.357 --> 35:51.694
I have a telephonic search
warrant that says I can.

36:27.563 --> 36:31.108
Calleigh, I got a hyperbolic
reflection 18 inches down.

36:32.193 --> 36:34.403
Something other than
concrete's down there.

36:34.779 --> 36:35.946
Tear it up.

37:24.161 --> 37:26.038
I have no idea how
that gun got in there.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.164
You know, it's funny.

37:27.289 --> 37:28.541
People always say that.

37:28.666 --> 37:31.919
You already told us that you
poured the concrete, mr. Farrell.

37:31.961 --> 37:34.755
I swear, I did not shoot anybody.

37:34.964 --> 37:36.799
Well, we'll just see about that.

38:16.881 --> 38:18.340
You know, mr. Brighton,

38:18.382 --> 38:20.968
everybody has secrets,

38:21.469 --> 38:23.262
and sometimes,

38:24.180 --> 38:26.057
we attempt to conceal them.

38:28.601 --> 38:30.061
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:30.102 --> 38:33.064
We found your gun
buried on your property.

38:33.189 --> 38:35.566
The one you used to kill lori.

38:37.902 --> 38:39.236
All this time...

38:40.196 --> 38:42.365
everything I've done has been...

38:42.865 --> 38:44.450
honest and above board.

38:44.492 --> 38:45.951
Until now.

38:46.285 --> 38:47.745
Until two years ago,

38:47.995 --> 38:50.664
when my daughter met Carlos Santiago.

38:50.706 --> 38:52.666
And he captured her on film.

38:54.377 --> 38:57.713
I built a very small
distribution company into A...

38:58.589 --> 39:02.093
global brand, all based
on one very simple image

39:02.301 --> 39:03.469
family.

39:03.761 --> 39:06.597
Mr. Santiago became a
threat to that image.

39:07.681 --> 39:08.557
If that video got out,

39:08.599 --> 39:10.476
it would have been
devastating to everything.

39:10.518 --> 39:12.853
You're talking about your family.

39:15.272 --> 39:16.774
To my company.

39:21.195 --> 39:22.863
When you figured out, mr. Brighton,

39:22.988 --> 39:26.992
that mr. Santiago had a safe
deposit box at lori's bank,

39:27.034 --> 39:30.371
you hired her to steal
that videotape, didn't you?

39:34.166 --> 39:35.960
Lori planned everything.

39:36.377 --> 39:38.045
Lori hired the crew.

39:38.295 --> 39:40.548
Dan, you're in charge
of digging the tunnel.

39:40.589 --> 39:42.675
Freddie, I'm counting
on you to get us inside.

39:42.717 --> 39:43.342
You work there.

39:43.384 --> 39:44.760
Why can't we just walk
in through the front door?

39:44.802 --> 39:45.845
Exactly.

39:45.886 --> 39:46.762
I already told you.

39:46.887 --> 39:49.056
I don't have a key. All I
have is the access codes.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.767
We have no choice. We
have to dig our way in.

39:53.269 --> 39:55.563
You drove your daughter's
car out to the tunnel

39:55.646 --> 39:57.773
to get the videotape

39:57.898 --> 39:59.442
and kill Lori.

39:59.984 --> 40:02.153
Lori was the only person
that knew anything about me.

40:02.278 --> 40:04.113
Lori's death was my...

40:04.280 --> 40:05.448
security.

40:06.574 --> 40:07.742
Who's there?

40:09.285 --> 40:10.119
Charles?

40:10.161 --> 40:11.454
Where are the others?

40:11.495 --> 40:12.747
Inside the vault.

40:12.788 --> 40:14.165
We did it, charles.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.543
What are you doing?

40:18.002 --> 40:19.545
Tying up loose ends.

41:02.671 --> 41:05.466
Tunnel collapsed before I
could get my hands on the tape.

41:08.469 --> 41:12.556
All I wanted to do was get out from
underneath Carlos Santiago's thumb.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.142
He was blackmailing me.

41:15.184 --> 41:16.143
Had nothing to do with M...

41:16.185 --> 41:18.145
He was using my company...

41:18.396 --> 41:21.357
My company to move his... his drugs.

41:22.900 --> 41:23.859
That made me sick.

41:23.901 --> 41:25.152
Mr. Brighton,

41:25.861 --> 41:27.446
you're under arrest.

41:27.488 --> 41:29.240
Get him out of here.

41:35.871 --> 41:36.956
We don't have all day here.

41:36.997 --> 41:38.666
Come on, let's go!

41:38.708 --> 41:39.959
Hurry it up!

41:41.293 --> 41:42.336
Come on!

41:42.670 --> 41:45.339
Say good-bye to andy
warhol, huh, Carlos?

41:46.382 --> 41:47.675
Lieutenant Caine.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.052
I had to learn to diversify.

41:50.261 --> 41:51.345
Where's the drugs?

41:51.387 --> 41:52.471
Drugs?

41:53.973 --> 41:55.141
these are oranges.

41:55.182 --> 41:56.225
Yeah, right.

41:56.267 --> 41:57.768
Hey, put that crate down.

42:07.361 --> 42:08.821
Looks like coke, H.

42:08.863 --> 42:10.364
You heard him, gentlemen.

42:10.489 --> 42:13.200
You're gonna pay for your sins, Carlos.

42:13.492 --> 42:15.369
This is way above your head, lieutenant.

42:15.578 --> 42:18.873
It is a skill I've perfected, Carlos.

42:19.165 --> 42:20.458
Take him.
