It's only the <i>Kinderlumper</i>
<i>come to join our celebration!</i>
<i>(CHUCKLING)</i>

09:33.840 --> 09:36.274
(SING-SONGY)
Now it's a party!

09:36.276 --> 09:41.212
I, uh... I believe the more
appropriate response
would be to flee in terror?

09:41.214 --> 09:45.350
But    <i>Kinderlumper,</i>
<i>why would I ever</i>
<i>run away from you?</i>

09:45.352 --> 09:47.152
Don't you remember
the    <i>Kinderlump</i>song?

09:47.154 --> 09:49.854
Remember?
Of course I remember.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.756
Mother used to sing me
the song every night.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.694
<i>♪ The Kinderlumper's</i>
<i>always going to love you</i>

09:55.696 --> 09:58.797
<i>♪ And bring you</i>
<i>lots of presents</i>
<i>while you sleep... ♪</i>

09:58.799 --> 10:00.765
No, no, no, wait!
Those are not the words!

10:00.767 --> 10:02.601
That's how she sang it to me.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.802
And I still have
some of the gifts
you brought me.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.870
Look, almond brittle!

10:05.872 --> 10:08.540
No! But you...
But you don't even
like almond brittle!

10:08.542 --> 10:10.709
I know.
That's why I never ate it.

10:10.711 --> 10:13.878
No! (SOBBING)

10:13.880 --> 10:15.680
No, it's not fair!
Funny, I never thought
of the <i>Kinderlumper</i>

10:15.682 --> 10:17.215
as such a crybaby.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.250
Oh, no, the effect
is wearing off.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.822
(SCREAMING)
Run for your lives!

10:28.461 --> 10:30.261
They're coming!
The chinchillas!

10:30.263 --> 10:33.365
It's too late for me,
save yourselves!

10:34.500 --> 10:36.468
Ooh! (GIGGLING)

10:36.470 --> 10:38.436
No, no, no. Stop, no.
(LAUGHING)

10:38.438 --> 10:41.172
Where you this dramatic
when you were
Rutabaga Princess?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.774
Oh, yeah.
Stop it!
No, seriously.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.643
Candace,
that was so exciting!

10:44.645 --> 10:46.845
You're the best
Rutabaga Princess yet!

10:46.847 --> 10:48.880
Phineas! I thought
you were stampeded!

10:48.882 --> 10:50.515
We were! It didn't hurt.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.450
They were big,
but they were still fluffy.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.553
It's like being run over
by cotton candy,
but less sticky.

10:55.555 --> 10:58.690
That was amazing!
We got it all on camera!

10:58.692 --> 11:02.193
Wait, really? Did you get
Phineas and Ferb in their
rutabaga vehicles?

11:02.195 --> 11:04.229
Yep! The whole thing!

11:04.231 --> 11:05.897
Where's the camera?
Oh, it's right over there.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.602
No, the biggest
story of my career!

11:10.604 --> 11:12.570
(SOBS) And it just
flew away!

11:12.572 --> 11:15.607
Welcome to my world, Mike.
Welcome to my world.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.875
Oh! There you are, Perry.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.877
Get over here,
you hairy little beast.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.478
(CHATTERING)
