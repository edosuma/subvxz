It is nothing.

00:28.862 --> 00:31.922
He's not doing that on purpose, is he?
You know, just to keep me interested?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.523
Well, that depends.
Are you losing interest?

00:34.634 --> 00:37.797
No. We haven't found so much
as a snapped twig on this planet,

but, hey, to me it's all good, baby.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.401
CARTER: Teal'c's intel did suggest

00:41.508 --> 00:43.908
that the Sodan are rumored
to have a base of operations here.

00:44.177 --> 00:48.045
Yeah, but Teal'c's intel came from
a bunch of Jaffa he used to be at war with.

was without purpose?

that you will answer for your crimes

12:11.130 --> 12:14.065
I'd say the nine hours
you spent working on him

12:14.167 --> 12:16.032
might have something to do with it.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.432
Nice work.

I did what I could to save it,
but his symbiote was too badly damaged.

We had no choice but to remove it
and start him on tretonin.

As soon as he regains consciousness,
I want to know.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.445
Why? So you can interrogate him?

but that's the idea.

The Goa'uld should have been defeated

13:45.758 --> 13:48.852
My ancestors were
one of the first of the Sodan.

13:49.862 --> 13:53.423
They were part of an elite command force
under the Goa'uld lshkur.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.532
For years, they pillaged
and plundered under his name,

driving fear into the hearts
of all those that would oppose his rule.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.276

14:05.578 --> 14:08.445
the more they were able
to discern the truth

that he was not a god at all,
but merely an impostor.

their search led them to this world.

Look, for the first time in their history,
the Jaffa are free.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.299
But it won't last
without strong leadership.

Speak not of skill to me.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.561
Many Jaffa have fought
and died for a cause

19:25.664 --> 19:27.325
that was started
by the warriors of the Sodan.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.627
And for what?

19:29.068 --> 19:31.593
Instead of respecting
the traditions of our ancestors,

19:31.704 --> 19:34.400
you would only seek
to lead them further astray.

20:32.031 --> 20:32.998
That way.

20:33.165 --> 20:36.498
Blue is left, red is right. Got it.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.662
-Faster!
-Bastard.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.837
How did I do?

21:19.478 --> 21:22.140
Badly. Again.

21:22.381 --> 21:24.406
Yeah, you stop using that gadget,

21:24.917 --> 21:27.784
I guarantee you I'll do better.

21:27.886 --> 21:31.219
A Sodan warrior must anticipate
an attack at any moment.

21:31.657 --> 21:32.988
Yeah, well.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.089
Where did you guys
get those things, anyway?

21:35.194 --> 21:38.686
The writings of our gods instructed us
how to construct many of their devices.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.493
We use them
to protect our sacred ground.

21:41.834 --> 21:45.964
Speaking of gods,
I know this is probably taboo,

21:46.939 --> 21:48.930
but I need to talk to your boss.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.673
That visitor you had yesterday,

21:51.777 --> 21:54.575
I'm assuming it's not
the first time he's been here.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.843
I've met their kind before.
They're bad news.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.921
Look, I'll do any crazy
training exercise you want.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.421
Within reason.

22:08.594 --> 22:11.620
Finish the course in time
and I'll consider it.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.130
You know,

22:15.901 --> 22:19.530
a bag of sand with a hole in it
is not an accurate timing device.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.403
You are an evil man.

22:43.462 --> 22:46.761
-Please, sit.
-I'm good.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.468
Okay,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.062
maybe I will sit.

22:59.411 --> 23:03.609
You know, I'm starting to get an idea
why you guys attacked us.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.447
That Prior's telling you we're enemies.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.814
Is he wrong?

23:10.456 --> 23:14.256
You could've cut us down the second we
stepped through the gate, but you didn't.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.090
Generations of my people fought
and died under exile,

23:18.630 --> 23:24.398
praying for the day when we could
seek the path without recrimination.

23:24.503 --> 23:28.599
When we prayed to the gods,
did they hear us, Mitchell?

23:28.774 --> 23:33.108
Did they once give us a sign
as proof of their existence?

23:35.214 --> 23:39.412
I know that the Ori are not the Ancients,

23:39.618 --> 23:43.179
but can there be any doubt
that they are gods?

23:43.722 --> 23:47.283
And if they can lead us
to the path of enlightenment,

23:47.659 --> 23:49.217
how can I refuse them?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.725
You're making a big mistake.

23:52.030 --> 23:56.057
These Ori are not what you think they are.
They are not even close.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.135
Dekeshan!

23:59.905 --> 24:02.931
Perhaps when you face your death,

24:03.375 --> 24:07.334
in your final moments, you'll understand.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.344
I've already been there.

24:12.317 --> 24:13.784
I understand.

24:39.745 --> 24:42.680
-You may rest now.
-No, I'm good. Let's keep going.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.181
You are not tired?

24:46.518 --> 24:49.112
Six weeks Airborne training
at Fort Benning, that's tired.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.916
This is nothing. Come on.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.057
If I wanna survive this kel shak Io thing,

24:53.158 --> 24:55.319
I'm gonna need to know a hell of a
lot more than you're teaching me.

24:55.427 --> 24:58.555
Quit pussyfooting around
and stop holding back. Let's go.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.828
You believe the staff
is what makes you strong.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.480
The krantu is nothing
but an extension of your body.

25:17.649 --> 25:21.312
No true warrior depends on a weapon
for strength or advantage.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.715
See, that's what I'm talking about.

25:25.991 --> 25:27.185
Drink.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.800
I'm not gonna get used to this stuff.

25:41.673 --> 25:44.904
Were it not for my teas,
you would have died many days ago.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.814
It was self-defense, you know.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.347
The Jaffa I killed. It was him or me.

25:56.922 --> 26:01.825
It does not matter. Blood has been spilled,
our laws decree you must answer for it.

26:05.497 --> 26:06.725
So, who was he?

26:08.967 --> 26:10.491
His name was Volnek.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.898
A most skilled warrior.

26:18.910 --> 26:21.811
Look, for what it's worth...

26:26.551 --> 26:27.984
There's nothing I can say, is there?

26:29.755 --> 26:30.813
No.

26:37.162 --> 26:40.154
So who do I fight?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.825
Lord Haikon will determine that
on the eve of your battle.

26:42.934 --> 26:46.370
Usually, it is the closest blood kin
to the slain warrior.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.165
Right.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.105
And the next of kin
is just as tough as he was.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.501
Do I stand a chance?

26:57.582 --> 26:58.879
Never mind.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.283
I promise I'll die well and all that jazz.

27:04.823 --> 27:08.418
But before I kick it I gotta ask,

27:10.796 --> 27:12.764
you buying what these Priors are selling?

27:12.864 --> 27:16.095
Lord Haikon has led us
for more than a hundred years.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.862
He knows what is best for us all.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.164
Yeah, yeah, look I get it.
You are a team player.

27:20.272 --> 27:23.036
I'm asking, what do you think?

27:24.042 --> 27:28.172
It is not my place to question
Haikon's judgment, nor is it yours.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.340
Well, somebody better.
Because if you guys follow the Ori,

27:31.450 --> 27:35.978
all of your traditions, your krantu staffs,
your precious path,

27:36.088 --> 27:38.921
your tasty beverages,
it's all going down the drain.

27:39.024 --> 27:40.355
Enough!

27:41.593 --> 27:42.821
We're finished for the day.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.844
TEAL'C: You say a Prior
has come to the Sodan

28:00.946 --> 28:03.972
and you have decided
to follow the word of the Ori?

28:04.082 --> 28:08.212
-I walk the path of our true gods...
-The Ori are not gods!

28:09.554 --> 28:11.317
What did the Prior promise you?

28:11.423 --> 28:16.224
The place ofhonor at his side
as heralds for your new masters?

28:17.229 --> 28:21.063
This Prior will have you hunt down
and kill all Jaffa

28:21.166 --> 28:24.101
who refuse to follow the path of Origin.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.667
That is the path you walk.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.239
I will learn the codes
of the Ancient transporter.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.447
No matter how long it takes.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.452
This is going nowhere.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.923
Two weeks and he hasn't given us
so much as a decent haiku.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.618
Well, it's understandable, sir.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.856
Most Jaffa would never break
under normal interrogation techniques.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.228
Not to mention the fact that
the Sodan are an elite group of warriors.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.392
I'm sure their minds are trained
to withstand a lot worse.

28:57.502 --> 28:58.730
What about the device?

28:59.271 --> 29:01.535
We haven't made much progress,
I'm afraid.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.471
It seems the code
preventing us from using it

29:03.575 --> 29:05.736
is rigged to some sort of
defense mechanism.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.610
Dr. Lee received a few nasty volts
while trying to implement an override.

29:09.714 --> 29:11.204
How is he?

29:11.650 --> 29:15.177
Dr. Lam says the feeling
should return to his legs in a few days.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.355
Meanwhile, the lnternational Committee
is keeping score

29:18.457 --> 29:21.790
of all the resources we're using
to try to find Mitchell.

29:21.893 --> 29:24.657
Science teams,
orbital scans by Prometheus...

29:24.763 --> 29:26.890
All of them coming up empty.
Certainly doesn't look good.

29:26.998 --> 29:31.264
Another few days and they'll tell us to
shut down search and rescue operations.

29:31.369 --> 29:32.893
Shut it down?

29:33.638 --> 29:36.664
Sir, with all due respect,
in the past we have spent months

29:36.775 --> 29:39.505
searching for our people in the field.
We can't just stop looking.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.171
What she's saying, sir,
is we've never left a man behind.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.840
I'm more than familiar
with the concept, Dr. Jackson.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.248
Give me something I can use, soon.

29:47.352 --> 29:51.755
Or the next paperwork I fill out
will declare Mitchell MlA.

30:24.890 --> 30:28.519
-I just need a minute.
-Let him pass.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.062
Thank you. All right, I'll make this quick.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.499
That Prior represents
a race of Ancients, yes.

30:36.601 --> 30:37.659
But believe me when I tell you

30:37.769 --> 30:40.237
they are not the Ancients
you wanna worship.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.273
The Prior has healed our sick,

30:44.009 --> 30:46.978
caused our crops to grow as if by magic.

30:47.312 --> 30:49.280
Why should I doubt the power of the Ori?

30:49.381 --> 30:52.839
Their power is not
what you should question.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.612
It's how they use it.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.752
Anyone refuses to worship them
and they die.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.518
And I'm not talking about
a few nonbelievers here and there.

31:00.625 --> 31:03.321
I'm talking about whole planets wiped out.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.654
And I should simply
take your word for this?

31:08.066 --> 31:13.732
You want to believe my people are
godless and inferior, go right ahead.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.203
But we have never needed proof
of our gods' existence

31:17.309 --> 31:18.674
in order to believe in them.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.541
Faith.

31:25.784 --> 31:30.153
It was your faith
that sustained you for 5,000 years.

31:30.255 --> 31:32.314
Not the Ancients themselves.

31:32.691 --> 31:36.252
Don't throw your history away
for a bagful of magic tricks.

31:41.499 --> 31:44.866
Admit it. Haikon has totally lost his mind.

31:47.906 --> 31:51.364
A warrior cannot talk and fight
at the same time.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.503
A fact you refuse to accept.

31:56.181 --> 31:57.239
Got it.

32:15.233 --> 32:18.760
You may provide a challenge
to your opponent after all, Mitchell.

32:20.405 --> 32:24.000
Followed by my violent death, of course.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.371
Of course.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.507
To my inevitable demise.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.209
Why do you do this?

32:36.321 --> 32:38.915
-Do what?
-Train this hard.

32:40.025 --> 32:42.255
These are the last days of your life.

32:42.727 --> 32:45.525
I would think you would
spend more time in reflection.

32:46.731 --> 32:48.289
Well, all I know is

32:49.267 --> 32:53.431
the moment you accept your fate,
that's when you're as good as dead.

32:53.905 --> 32:55.702
Till then, all bets are off.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.238
You cannot survive kel shak Io.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.710
Well, no offense,

33:02.914 --> 33:06.145
but I've endured things I wasn't
supposed to have survived before

33:06.584 --> 33:07.983
and I'm still here.

33:14.392 --> 33:17.691
How can you be certain
the Prior speaks falsely?

33:20.365 --> 33:21.559
Because

33:23.702 --> 33:27.900
I've seen entire planets wiped out
because they refused to follow the Ori.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.668
Look, I'm not trying to tell you
what to think.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.771
But if everything I believed
was being threatened,

33:33.878 --> 33:34.902
I'd wanna know.

33:37.916 --> 33:41.682
Jolan, your people shouldn't suffer
for their faith.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.688
-You two again.
-Yes.

33:54.899 --> 33:57.390
Us two again.

33:57.635 --> 33:59.830
Save your words. I am not in the mood.

34:00.238 --> 34:03.571
We know how you feel.
But we're not here to talk.

34:03.808 --> 34:07.335
You require evidence
that the Ori are not to be trusted.

34:10.415 --> 34:13.816
This is Tass'an, one of the founders
of a free Jaffa settlement

34:13.918 --> 34:15.613
on a planet called Sartorus.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.449
Many families came to live there

34:17.555 --> 34:21.082
to enjoy the freedom
that they fought so hard to achieve.

34:21.526 --> 34:22.823
He is Sodan?

34:24.129 --> 34:26.927
-lndeed.
-Tell him what happened.

34:28.933 --> 34:32.926
A month ago,
a man came through the Chappa'ai.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.667
He called himself a Prior.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.202
He told us of powerful gods called the Ori,

34:39.544 --> 34:43.036
who he claimed would give us protection

34:43.448 --> 34:46.042
and show us the path to enlightenment.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.015
Then he left.

34:48.520 --> 34:52.354
He later returned.
Told us we had to make a choice.

34:53.124 --> 34:56.753
Follow the Ori or be destroyed.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.330
We chose to resist.

35:05.403 --> 35:06.995
Continue, brother.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.802
He dialed the Chappa'ai

35:11.676 --> 35:15.043
and merely placed his staff
in the ground in front of it.

35:15.146 --> 35:20.846
Then the earth shook with a fierceness
I have never seen nor heard of before.

35:21.085 --> 35:23.713
In moments, our city was leveled.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.919
Hundreds of our people
wiped out in an instant.

35:28.026 --> 35:31.052
Enough of these lies.

35:31.996 --> 35:35.523
You expect me to take the word
of this sorry excuse for a Jaffa?

35:35.633 --> 35:39.399
I witnessed the destruction
with my own eyes!

35:40.638 --> 35:42.469
Heed my words, brother.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.978
If a Prior visits your world, leave.

36:10.835 --> 36:15.363
You have spilled the blood
of a Sodan warrior, human.

36:15.940 --> 36:17.430
Do you deny it?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.741
No, but it wasn't...

36:24.682 --> 36:26.149
No, I don't deny it.

36:27.085 --> 36:32.284
If any blood kin of the warrior
seek recompense,

36:32.857 --> 36:35.724
Iet him step forward now!

36:36.060 --> 36:37.357
I seek it.

36:40.164 --> 36:41.222
You?

36:41.532 --> 36:44.000
In the name of Volnek of Geshrel,

36:45.203 --> 36:46.295
my brother.

36:58.182 --> 37:00.776
May the blood spilled here today

37:00.885 --> 37:04.377
settle this debt once and for all.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.164
You may begin.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.901
May you die well.

37:19.304 --> 37:20.532
Likewise.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.628
(SCREAMING)

38:46.758 --> 38:48.385
The human is dead.

38:49.961 --> 38:52.691
The blood of the Sodan has been avenged.

38:52.797 --> 38:55.265
He fought and died a warrior, my lord.

38:55.533 --> 38:58.730
It is only fitting he be given
the rite of shel mak assah.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.128
Very well.

39:00.671 --> 39:04.664
With your permission, my lord,
I would like to take care of it myself.

39:26.898 --> 39:27.956
(GROANING)

39:30.401 --> 39:32.392
I was afraid you would not wake.

39:33.738 --> 39:35.865
Well, maybe I shouldn't have.

39:36.441 --> 39:38.705
-How long was l...
-Seven hours.

39:39.877 --> 39:43.574
Seven? I thought it was
only supposed to be two.

39:43.681 --> 39:46.548
I may have inadvertently
made the elixir too strong.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.344
Yeah.

39:50.254 --> 39:51.346
(EXCLAIMS)

39:55.359 --> 39:57.657
Yeah, that's gonna leave a scar.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.889
-So did it work?
-The ruse was most effective.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.795
They believe you are dead.

40:04.569 --> 40:06.093
Well done, Bones.

40:08.439 --> 40:09.770
Never mind.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.304
So, where does this leave you?

40:16.280 --> 40:19.545
If the Prior intends
to mislead the Sodan as you say,

40:21.085 --> 40:22.552
then I am his enemy.

40:23.287 --> 40:24.652
And Haikon?

40:25.723 --> 40:28.521
It may be too late
to convince him of his mistake,

40:28.759 --> 40:31.751
but there are several other warriors
who feel as I do.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.590
We will continue
to walk the path of the Sodan

40:36.701 --> 40:39.932
until the others see
the error of their ways.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.168
Well, for what it's worth,

40:43.174 --> 40:44.937
you won't walk alone.

40:55.353 --> 40:56.342
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

40:56.454 --> 40:57.546
Come.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.450
-How did it go?
-Not well.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.549
Even after we showed him
video footage of the damage,

41:02.660 --> 41:03.684
Volnek still refuses to believe

41:03.794 --> 41:05.853
the Ori are responsible
for what happened on Sartorus.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.893
-What's he doing now?
-Nothing.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.398
He hasn't said a word since Tass'an left.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.525
Which puts us back to square one.

41:11.636 --> 41:13.934
Yeah, basically. Teal'c seems to think...

41:14.038 --> 41:16.097
HARRIMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
Unscheduled offworld activation.

41:16.207 --> 41:17.196
(ALARM WAILING)

41:17.308 --> 41:19.776
-What have we got, Chief?
-We're receiving an lDC, sir.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.674
-It's Colonel Mitchell.
-You're kidding.

41:21.779 --> 41:23.610
I would never do that, sir.

41:26.884 --> 41:28.579
You have a visitor.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.285
-You?
-Yeah, I thought you were dead, too.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.191
-We have unfinished business.
-Just take it easy.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.161
-You shot me.
-You shot me first.

41:40.264 --> 41:43.665
-I will have vengeance.
-You will listen, brother.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.101
I know that you think we're enemies.

41:53.211 --> 41:56.180
And right now it doesn't matter
if we become allies.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.272
What matters is that
you understand the truth.

42:08.292 --> 42:10.590
You are fortunate my brother drugged you.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.823
You would never have survived
a true kel shak Io.

42:14.298 --> 42:17.699
I don't know. I took you down pretty good.

42:18.236 --> 42:21.501
-You were lucky.
-Lucky is good.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.309
Granting my freedom
changes nothing, Mitchell.

42:40.758 --> 42:42.157
We will meet again.

42:43.861 --> 42:45.294
Looking forward to it.
