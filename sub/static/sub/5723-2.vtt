I don't want to infect you.

15:35.304 --> 15:37.470
That sucks.

15:37.472 --> 15:40.173
I ordered you a cheeseburger.

15:40.175 --> 15:41.842
Thank you.

15:44.313 --> 15:45.929
[sighs]

15:47.316 --> 15:49.766
[sniffling]

15:49.768 --> 15:52.435
Um, school good?

15:52.437 --> 15:54.104
It's August.

15:54.106 --> 15:56.356
- [both laugh]
- It's August.

15:56.358 --> 15:57.691
- You're right.
- Yeah.

16:00.078 --> 16:03.864
Um, Dad and Nora adopted the baby.

16:06.201 --> 16:07.534
Wow.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.707
They still calling it Lily?

16:13.709 --> 16:15.375
Yeah, you don't like that?

16:15.377 --> 16:17.711
Who cares what I like?

16:19.882 --> 16:22.015
I care.

16:22.017 --> 16:24.634
I mean, you gave her to us.

16:26.138 --> 16:27.771
Did you tell Dad?

16:27.773 --> 16:29.222
No.

16:29.224 --> 16:30.557
- Jill, did you?
- No.

16:30.559 --> 16:31.775
You can't tell Dad.

16:31.777 --> 16:33.944
I promised you that I wouldn't.

16:41.737 --> 16:43.820
You know, you should really
just call him sometime.

16:43.822 --> 16:46.907
- He worries about you.
- We're not starting that again, Jill.

16:46.909 --> 16:50.126
- Why are you so angry?
- I'm not. I'm not angry.

16:51.747 --> 16:54.297
Well, can I just tell him
that I know you're okay?

16:54.299 --> 16:56.917
No, Jill, you can't.

16:59.087 --> 17:00.136
Why not?

17:02.257 --> 17:04.424
'Cause nobody's okay.

17:14.603 --> 17:16.519
I am.

17:18.106 --> 17:22.275
And so is Dad and Nora.

17:22.277 --> 17:24.861
[sniffles]

17:24.863 --> 17:26.913
We're all okay.

17:29.618 --> 17:32.002
That's good for you.

17:32.004 --> 17:33.920
You deserve that.

17:37.292 --> 17:39.092
One big, happy family.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.514
Well, you can be a part of it.

17:44.516 --> 17:47.133
I mean, anytime.

17:55.610 --> 17:57.360
I'm sorry.

17:59.898 --> 18:02.866
She, um...

18:02.868 --> 18:04.985
she wanted me to give this to you.

18:27.259 --> 18:28.842
I love you.

18:32.681 --> 18:34.397
I love you, too.

19:19.778 --> 19:22.395
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

19:25.901 --> 19:26.983
Hello.

19:26.985 --> 19:28.568
<i>Nora, Mike from Century.</i>

19:28.570 --> 19:30.737
- <i>Are you sitting down?</i>
- No, I'm standing.

19:30.739 --> 19:33.823
<i>There's an offer on your house. 2.7.</i>

19:35.460 --> 19:38.244
- Million?
- <i>Yeah, million.</i>

19:38.246 --> 19:40.130
But we listed it for 600,000.

19:40.132 --> 19:41.548
- Why would they...
- <i>It's a preemptive bid.</i>

19:41.550 --> 19:43.049
<i>Listen, they put it on a clock.</i>

19:43.051 --> 19:44.467
<i>We have until end of day to respond.</i>

19:44.469 --> 19:46.886
<i>So I'm saying yes, yes?</i>

19:48.557 --> 19:50.306
<i>Nora?</i>

19:54.062 --> 19:57.931
Why are you offering me four times
what I'm asking for my house?

19:57.933 --> 20:01.935
Your residence has been flagged
as a highly desirable property

20:01.937 --> 20:03.403
by a number of separate institutions.

20:04.573 --> 20:06.406
What's your institution?

20:06.408 --> 20:08.942
- We're from MIT.
- Good school.

20:08.944 --> 20:10.326
It is, thank you.

20:10.328 --> 20:12.445
We're spearheading a research project

20:12.447 --> 20:14.531
and the university
is financing the grant.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.199
- To buy my house?
- Yes.

20:16.201 --> 20:19.285
- Why?
- Because it is anomalous.

20:21.373 --> 20:23.339
It's a deviation
from the statistical norm...

20:23.341 --> 20:25.208
She knows what it means.

20:25.210 --> 20:26.960
You want to buy my house
because my husband

20:26.962 --> 20:28.711
and children disappeared from here.

20:28.713 --> 20:31.431
Yes, and our deepest
condolences for your loss.

20:31.433 --> 20:33.883
- So you have a guess?
- Sorry?

20:33.885 --> 20:35.268
If they're writing you
a grant that big,

20:35.270 --> 20:37.220
you must have a guess
as to where my family went.

20:38.940 --> 20:43.026
We can't determine where, only why.

20:44.146 --> 20:45.528
I don't understand.

20:46.815 --> 20:50.316
Our guess is that it's
a matter of geography.

20:51.703 --> 20:53.486
Places.

20:53.488 --> 20:56.122
And the richest data can
be gathered from sites

20:56.124 --> 21:00.410
where multiple departures have
occurred in the same proximity,

21:00.412 --> 21:01.995
like right here.

21:06.968 --> 21:08.668
But I was here with them.

21:08.670 --> 21:12.639
Our understanding is that your
family was here at the table,

21:12.641 --> 21:14.841
but you were over by the sink, yes?

21:16.511 --> 21:20.763
You're saying if I was sitting
right here, I would have gone, too?

21:20.765 --> 21:25.351
If you sell us your house, we'll be
one step closer to answering that.

21:25.353 --> 21:27.854
- Then what?
- Sorry?

21:27.856 --> 21:29.272
If you're right, then what?

21:29.274 --> 21:31.024
What does it matter?

21:31.026 --> 21:34.194
People want to be able to protect
themselves against a recurrence.

21:36.698 --> 21:39.616
You think it's gonna happen again?

21:39.618 --> 21:42.202
Why wouldn't it?

21:55.634 --> 21:57.217
[door beeps, opens]

22:00.722 --> 22:02.388
Staties offer you anything?

22:02.390 --> 22:04.274
Some shitty coffee out there.

22:06.528 --> 22:09.529
Lois Makepeace from ATFEC.

22:09.531 --> 22:12.532
Kevin Garvey.

22:12.534 --> 22:14.400
Want to ask about the eye?

22:16.404 --> 22:18.404
No.

22:18.406 --> 22:21.708
Most people are curious.

22:21.710 --> 22:25.078
So they confirmed the ID
of the body in your truck.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.663
Patricia Levin.

22:26.665 --> 22:28.414
Regional leadership of the Guilty Remnant.

22:28.416 --> 22:31.084
- She went by Patti.
- Did you kill her?

22:31.086 --> 22:33.720
No, I disinterred her body.

22:33.722 --> 22:34.887
You know who did kill her?

22:34.889 --> 22:36.673
She killed herself, but I was...

22:36.675 --> 22:38.925
<i>So she killed herself?</i>

22:38.927 --> 22:41.761
Yes, but I was responsible for...

22:41.763 --> 22:45.815
But she killed herself?

22:45.817 --> 22:48.234
Yes, she did.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.270
- I...
- Don't care.

22:51.690 --> 22:53.690
I don't care how you
knew where she was buried

22:53.692 --> 22:56.442
or why you dug her up because
I don't care about her.

23:00.282 --> 23:03.249
I read your official resignation.

23:05.120 --> 23:08.588
Chief Kevin Garvey of Mapleton PD.

23:08.590 --> 23:10.623
You quit being a cop.

23:10.625 --> 23:14.677
Probably 'cause this piece
of shit Levin liked smoking

23:14.679 --> 23:17.597
and telling those other
chickenshits in her little club

23:17.599 --> 23:20.350
to cause a riot in your goddamn town.

23:20.352 --> 23:22.602
So she killed herself.

23:22.604 --> 23:24.387
The world spins on.

23:24.389 --> 23:27.140
Good riddance, Patricia,
we hardly fucking knew ya.

23:30.478 --> 23:32.862
Are you letting me go?

23:32.864 --> 23:34.947
Do you want to blow your life up?

23:34.949 --> 23:36.366
What?

23:36.368 --> 23:40.653
Do you want to blow your life up?

23:42.741 --> 23:44.324
No.

24:49.774 --> 24:52.024
Released? When?

24:52.026 --> 24:53.893
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:53.895 --> 24:55.395
You're dubious.

24:55.397 --> 24:56.946
I'm supposed to trust you

24:56.948 --> 24:58.898
just because you're wearing
normal clothes, not a bathrobe?

24:58.900 --> 25:00.566
Good fit, huh?

25:17.836 --> 25:21.087
just visiting for an
indefinite period of time.

25:21.089 --> 25:22.805
I'm gonna take her up for
her nap and hop in the shower.

25:22.807 --> 25:24.173
Okay.

25:24.175 --> 25:26.592
Hi. Your son's taking us
to dinner tonight.

25:26.594 --> 25:29.061
He made a reservation and everything.

25:29.063 --> 25:31.397
What a gentleman.

Nora: Why don't you two catch up?

Well, I still like Laurie.

25:47.499 --> 25:49.615
I just like Nora more.

26:07.302 --> 26:09.051
You.

- You implying that I'm not?
- Well...

26:15.276 --> 26:18.311

26:25.987 --> 26:28.905
Well, son, wouldn't you agree

26:28.907 --> 26:33.793
that the laws of fucking nature
seemed a bit upside down as of late?

26:37.582 --> 26:41.918
So, what, your voices,
they just went away?

26:41.920 --> 26:43.636
No, sir.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.723

26:58.436 --> 27:00.987
God, I love this town.

27:00.989 --> 27:03.105
But now everywhere I look,

27:03.107 --> 27:05.525
all I see is what's gone.

27:05.527 --> 27:08.861
So I can sit around and cry

27:08.863 --> 27:11.447
about how the world fucking ended

27:11.449 --> 27:13.666
or...

27:17.455 --> 27:19.539
I could start it up again.

27:24.679 --> 27:27.380
And we offer that grilled on
a bed of daily cut spinach.

27:27.382 --> 27:29.432
Or you can have it
roasted in our brick oven

27:29.434 --> 27:31.050

27:31.052 --> 27:33.603
The pasta is homemade agnolotti

27:33.605 --> 27:37.056
with veal ragout and we
prepare that al dente.

27:37.058 --> 27:40.226
Just a little brittleness to the bite.

27:40.228 --> 27:42.728
And just to remind you,

27:42.730 --> 27:45.398
the chef requests no substitutions.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.783
Can I get the pasta with
the sauce on the side?

27:47.785 --> 27:50.703
Yes, of course.

27:50.705 --> 27:56.375
And can I get that
without the brittleness to the bite?

27:56.377 --> 27:59.078
That's not technically a substitution.

28:00.632 --> 28:02.248
I'd be happy to ask.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.583
