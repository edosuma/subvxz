I know what it looks like,
but there was no other way.

36:42.634 --> 36:43.800
He took my daughter.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.635
Let me tell you
what this looks like.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.871
It looks like
you were assaulting mr. Graff

36:47.873 --> 36:49.973
And your c.I. Was attempting
to restrain you.

36:49.975 --> 36:53.243
It <i>looks</i> like you knowingly
led a team of agents in here

36:53.245 --> 36:54.477
With a fraudulent warrant.

36:54.479 --> 36:55.745
You need
to let me explain.

36:55.747 --> 36:59.349
No, you need to meet me
downstairs, both of you.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.084
These agents will make sure

37:01.086 --> 37:03.153
You don't get into
anymore trouble.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.930
Mr. Graff,
I want to assure you

37:13.932 --> 37:16.066
None of this was approved
by the bureau.

37:16.068 --> 37:19.669
Just talk to my lawyers.
Okay, honey?

37:53.271 --> 37:54.971
Stand down.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.940
Did your c.I. Know
that warrant was fake?

37:56.942 --> 37:58.808
No, ma'am, he didn't.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.910
None of the agents did,
just me.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.912
Okay, I want you
out of here.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.447
Gracie's probably
just with some friends.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.182
I'll find her.
I promise.

38:08.219 --> 38:11.321
Graff let us search it,
the offices and the labs.

38:11.323 --> 38:13.423
We used the dog
with gracie's scent.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.825
She's not here.
He doesn't have her.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.227
Gracie ran away.

38:17.229 --> 38:18.495
[ voice breaking ]
they made it look like that.

38:18.497 --> 38:19.896
Agent pritchard --

38:19.898 --> 38:21.831
He made it look like gloria's
death was a hit-and-run,

38:21.833 --> 38:24.567
Made it look like that john doe
did the killings.

38:24.569 --> 38:26.269
Why?
Why would he do that?

38:26.271 --> 38:29.172
[ sighs ]

38:29.174 --> 38:32.275
Gracie has a precursor
in her dna.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.978
She can be regenerated,
brought back from the dead.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.747
I know it sounds crazy.

38:37.749 --> 38:40.684
My father has it, too.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.285
Your father has it?

38:42.287 --> 38:45.288
Yeah. Him.
That's my father.

38:45.290 --> 38:47.657
Test his dna.
He has it, too.

38:50.428 --> 38:52.662
That's why
connor took her.

38:55.599 --> 38:58.301
Agent pritchard,
I'm relieving you of duty

38:58.303 --> 38:59.769
Effective immediately.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.605
You will surrender your gun
and your badge to me.

39:02.607 --> 39:06.242
I'm remanding you
to a 72-hour psych hold.

39:08.946 --> 39:11.381
Charges will be
brought against you for assault

39:11.383 --> 39:13.383
And falsifying
a court order.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.419
You will allow these agents
to place you in restraints.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.166
[ handcuffs click ]

39:30.168 --> 39:34.003
You need to go back in there.
He has my daughter.

39:34.005 --> 39:36.039
Please.

39:38.175 --> 39:48.084
Oh, man.
Just like his dad.

â™ª

40:20.117 --> 40:22.118
What happened to you?

40:22.120 --> 40:26.623
Just rugby.
Is everything ready here?

40:26.625 --> 40:28.892
This is what mary said
not to do.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.794
Mary said not to dream.

40:30.796 --> 40:33.930
I mean, she got hers.
Why can't you have yours?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.934
Arthur.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.436
<i>Yes, otto.</i>

40:48.880 --> 40:53.483
<i>Her name is gracie pritchard.</i>

40:53.485 --> 40:55.952
I know her name.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.021
Call her
test subject zero.

41:00.224 --> 41:04.461
The process will induce
a seizure...

41:04.463 --> 41:07.263
And great deal of pain.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.933
The subject has been given a
sufficient amount of anesthesia,

41:09.935 --> 41:11.701
Though, upon waking...

41:14.839 --> 41:17.640
...The aftereffects
may be permanent.

No. Please.

41:57.983 --> 42:00.183
Let me --

42:00.185 --> 42:03.286
Otto is gone,

42:03.288 --> 42:05.788
And soon,
pritchard will be, too.

What are you here
to take from me now?

42:08.360 --> 42:10.293
[ crying ] nothing.

42:10.295 --> 42:13.196
I just came to help you.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.697
I know where gracie is,

42:14.699 --> 42:18.401
And I know where
connor graff has her.

42:18.403 --> 42:22.138
Where?

42:22.140 --> 42:25.842
In the place
where connor finished me...
