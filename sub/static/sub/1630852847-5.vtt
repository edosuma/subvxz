00:12.971 --> 00:14.014
- Previously on "Bel-Air"...

00:14.055 --> 00:15.015
- Rashad knows
you in Bel-Air.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.391
- He sent a shooter
for Tray,

00:16.433 --> 00:17.642
and now apparently,
he knows I'm in Bel-Air, so--

00:17.684 --> 00:18.852
- Don't trouble yourself, Will.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.103
I'll handle the situation.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.271
- Where do I know you from?

00:21.312 --> 00:22.439
- Oh, she used
to be a painter.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.774
- You have a gift.
- Had a gift.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.277
- Reid Broderick
is back in Los Angeles.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.778
Should I set up a meeting?

00:28.820 --> 00:31.781
- Seems like she's content
living out in the pool house.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.034
It's been two years, Hilary.
What have you even figured out?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.785
- I figured out
that you don't believe in me.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.746
- We're one of the top
influencer houses

00:37.787 --> 00:38.830
on the planet.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.832
- I'm moving out.
- Influencer house?

00:40.874 --> 00:44.461
- Would it kill you to just say
congratulations for once?

00:44.502 --> 00:46.921
- My mom died three years ago.
Lupus.

00:46.963 --> 00:49.424
But if we're gonna be friends,
it's part of who I am.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.967
- I'm glad we're friends.
- Me too.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.802
- You might have everyone else
fooled, but not me.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.637
Did you really come out here
for better education, Will?

00:54.679 --> 00:56.514
- What about the crooked LAPD?
- Yeah.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.224
- Defund the cops!
[overlapping chatter]

00:58.266 --> 00:59.434
- Defund them!

00:59.476 --> 01:00.977
- Defunding the police
is critical.

01:01.019 --> 01:02.312
all: Yeah.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.855
- Tray can come out here
by the end of the week?

01:03.897 --> 01:05.023
- Deal.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.066
- Hey, you flying out
to LA!

01:06.107 --> 01:07.275
- I got some great news too.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.361
Rashad is dead.

you out here, boy.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.417
- This jawn is crazy, bro.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.169

Hey, bro. Go, go ahead.
Ask--ask it like I showed you.

"Thank you, Lexus."

01:37.555 --> 01:39.349
- Thank you, Lexus.
both: [chuckle]

01:39.391 --> 01:43.019

of last summer, bro.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.312
On 60th and Market.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.605
- Oh! Hey man,
speaking of Philly,

01:45.647 --> 01:47.524
I know the Turk
has been missing your boy.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.693
- Why would they ask about you
when I'm still there, bro?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.069
- Whatever.
- Ain't nobody worried

01:51.111 --> 01:52.862
about you.
- Whatever.

01:52.904 --> 01:55.198
You still be, uh,
hanging with Jackie

01:55.240 --> 01:56.866
and her friends at the park?

01:56.908 --> 01:59.411
- Nah, bro.
I ain't been going over for...

01:59.452 --> 02:01.329
Even with Rashad dead.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.997
No, I ain't feeling it.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.959
- Yeah, man, I'm, uh...

02:06.543 --> 02:08.336
Sorry you had to
go through that shit.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.466

02:24.436 --> 02:26.438
- Okay, Dad, don't pack
the boxes too heavy

02:26.479 --> 02:27.897
and remember,
wrap every plate.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.608
How did I ever fit all of this
into a pool house?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.111
- All right.
How about you pack a box

02:33.153 --> 02:35.447
and show your man
exactly how you want it done?

02:36.781 --> 02:38.825

Appreciate ya.

Honestly,
planning this dinner

02:41.453 --> 02:42.704
for my new housemates

02:42.746 --> 02:44.539
has been way more difficult
than I expected.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.957
- Why don't you lean
on your mom?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.584
She used to throw parties
like this all the time

02:47.625 --> 02:50.045
for her art friends
back in the day.

02:50.086 --> 02:53.214
- Mom's vibe is more
white wine and upscale

02:53.256 --> 02:54.674
than anything I'm trying to do.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.426
- You know,
you and your mother

02:56.468 --> 02:58.762
need to cut
each other some slack.

02:58.803 --> 02:59.846

02:59.888 --> 03:01.514

to live my life.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.016
She's the one
that's always on my back.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.227
- That's because she loves you,
honey bee.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.563
She just...worries.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.276
But once she sees you shine

you ain't gotta hide out

03:51.272 --> 03:54.442
here in LA no more.
You can come back to Philly.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.236

amongst likely voters,

through quite the ordeal,

to say the least.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.688
- Yeah, yeah.

quite an ordeal, I guess.

- Oh, hey,
I'm so glad you called.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.523
Will's been floating
the idea of, you know,

08:01.564 --> 08:02.982
heading back to Philly.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.859
- It's been on my mind, too.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.695
I was thinking he could
fly home for Thanksgiving,

08:06.736 --> 08:08.822
and that's it.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.324
- Vy, I've been thinking
Will should stay here.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.284
He's just getting
his rhythm.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.247
Oh, two weeks ago, he went
to an Alpha event with Phil

08:17.288 --> 08:19.249
and impressed several
of the fraternity brothers.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.001
And now they're talking about
hooking him up

08:21.042 --> 08:22.836
with a summer internship.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.256
- Viv, it's not news to me
that my son is talented.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.966
I've had college scouts
calling about Will

08:28.008 --> 08:29.467
since he was a freshmen.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.137
- But I'm talking about
a world outside of sports, Vy.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.639
I'm talking about politics,
business, the arts.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.474
I mean, think of all
the opportunities

08:36.516 --> 08:38.435
that he could have here.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.645
- Now, we both know
that this arrangement

08:40.687 --> 08:42.355
was always meant
to be temporary.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.108
I'm not done raising
my son, Viv.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.943
- I understand.
- Do you?

08:47.819 --> 08:51.489
Because it--it sounds like
you're trying to take my place.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.743
- No, no, no.
This isn't about you and me.

08:56.036 --> 09:00.540
- The hell it ain't.
- Well, can we agree

09:00.582 --> 09:02.542
that it shouldn't be?

09:02.584 --> 09:05.170
Look--listen, I promise

09:05.211 --> 09:08.423
I will not try to talk
Will into anything,

09:08.465 --> 09:09.924
and neither should you.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.679
We should just let Will come up
with his own decisions.

09:14.721 --> 09:18.224
- Will is still a child, Viv.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.477
My child.

09:22.103 --> 09:25.065
And I'm going to tell him
what I think is best for him.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.277
Look, I gotta go.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.779
[phone beeps]

09:30.820 --> 09:33.782
[soft music]

09:33.823 --> 09:37.327
* *

09:37.369 --> 09:38.703
- West Philly, boy!

09:38.745 --> 09:41.206
- I like that.
I like that.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.708
Yo, all these books.
You don't read, nigga.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.168
- Actually
that's "The Alchemist."

09:45.210 --> 09:47.420
That's a really good book.
- All these damn trophies.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.172
When you gonna give me
my shit back?

09:49.214 --> 09:50.882
- Boy, that trophy say,
"Will Smith."

09:51.424 --> 09:55.095
- Oh, what's this jawn?
Bel-Air Academy.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.306
This color's wack.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.642
I know that burns your skin
wearing that jawn, huh?

10:00.684 --> 10:03.687
- Mm-mm. We got nice little
team out here, for real.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.063
- [scoffs]
- We getting better too.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.231
Yo, how's the team
back home doing?

10:06.272 --> 10:09.859
- Real rap, bro.
We've been struggling.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.321
We lost to Norf, Douglas,

10:13.363 --> 10:14.781
and South East, bro.

10:15.407 --> 10:19.786
South East. But you coming
back soon, so we good.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.580
We great. We good.
We going to State.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.998
No cap.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.753
- Yeah, we should get ready
to go downstairs for dinner.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.465
[hip-hop in background]

10:32.507 --> 10:34.300
Which one do you want?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.594
- Come on, yo.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.305
We gotta wear suits
to go eat downstairs?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.515
- You know, we eating
in the formal dining room.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.808
So we gotta step it up
a little bit.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.143
That's it.
[chuckles]

10:43.184 --> 10:45.186
- You for real?
- Yeah.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.147
- [laughs]

10:47.188 --> 10:51.443
Yo, they really got you buyin'
into this bougie shit, bro.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.570
- Come on man.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.030
- Like that shit ain't right.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.740
- That's just how they do it.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.949
- [scoffs]

10:57.991 --> 11:00.160
Bro, purple ain't my color,
so...

11:00.201 --> 11:02.871
- Hey, that is a nice
purple suit, put--

11:04.372 --> 11:05.957
[door closes]

11:07.250 --> 11:08.293
[sighs]

11:13.006 --> 11:16.384
- Yo, wow!

11:16.426 --> 11:18.470
Wow! Ha!

11:18.511 --> 11:19.721
Oh my God.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.097
Hey, you got
everything set up.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.515
- I know I make it
look easy,

11:22.557 --> 11:23.808
but it is not, okay?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.062
And look over here.
Do you notice any cameras?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.482
- What cameras?
- I have one right there.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.484
And I have four other ones,
but they're hidden

11:32.525 --> 11:34.694
so my guests don't feel
self-conscious.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.029
- Ohh.
- Okay?

11:36.071 --> 11:39.032
- Uhh! Okay! Ha.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.283
Yo, is this thing on?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.826
- No, no.
You're good.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.828
- Okay, cool, 'cause I gotta
get your opinion on something.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.246
- Okay, what's up?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.999
- Would it be a bad idea
if I went back to Philly?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.959
- Why would you want
to go back to Philly?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.419
- I don't know.
Like I love LA,

11:51.461 --> 11:54.297
but Philly's home,
and I miss it.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.007
- Okay, but just because
you miss a place

11:56.049 --> 11:57.592
doesn't mean
you have to move back.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.052
- Yeah, but it's like
my mom, Tray,

11:59.094 --> 12:00.470
all my friends
back in Philly--

12:00.512 --> 12:01.888
they're expecting me
to go back.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.849
- Look, at the end
of the day, Will,

12:04.891 --> 12:06.393
you have
to answer to yourself.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.560
And I get it.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.104
It's scary disappointing
somebody you love,

12:09.145 --> 12:10.814
especially a parent.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.442
But they'll get over it,
and you will too.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.904
Look, I think
you should stay, okay?

12:33.461 --> 12:34.963
[both laugh]

12:36.756 --> 12:39.050
- Hey, baby.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.385
How long
you been standing there?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.638
- Ooh, long enough to see
how beautiful you are.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.098
- [chuckles]

12:45.140 --> 12:46.725
You talk to Vy?

12:46.766 --> 12:50.520
- Yeah, we talked, but--let's
talk about it after dinner.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.730
- Is it time?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.274
- Yes, and I am not
going out there alone.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.026
- Oh boy.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.736
Well, we gotta give
our guests a chance.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.320
- Mm-hmm.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.614
Well, they're Hilary's guests,
and they make their living

13:01.656 --> 13:03.408
showing off
on social media, so...

13:03.450 --> 13:05.952
Well, there's more to it
than that.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.246
Kylo, lead creator
in the house,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.166
men's lifestyle brand
specialist--

13:11.207 --> 13:14.461
He promotes expensive booze,
cigars, and colognes.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.588
Last year,
Kylo made over a million

13:16.629 --> 13:18.923
in paid sponsorships
and ad revenue.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.258
- Over a million?
- Mm-hmm.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.676
- How do you even know
all this?

13:21.718 --> 13:24.929
- Hilary sent out a prep email.
You didn't read it?

13:24.971 --> 13:26.389
- I skimmed it.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.808
Well, tell me who else
is coming to this party.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.268
- Well, there's Phanta.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.520
She specializes
in luxury travel.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.023
She gets paid to promote
the most exclusive hotels

13:35.065 --> 13:36.816
and vacation spots
in the world.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.277
- Can I have her job?
- Oh, and then there's Monica

13:39.319 --> 13:40.862
whose pronouns
are them and they.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.448
Monica's one of the leading
sex-positive

13:43.490 --> 13:45.617
relationship advice counselors
on social media.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.577
And they got their own
book deal with Oprah.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.329
- Okay,
you've made your point.

13:49.371 --> 13:53.875
Hilary's coworkers are...
quite accomplished.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.586
- Hold on to that feeling,
'cause the last two housemates

13:56.628 --> 13:58.672
are brothers,
Jared, and Nathan.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.424
They are stuntmen
and pranksters,

14:01.466 --> 14:04.552
better known as
"the Blackass Brothers."

14:05.595 --> 14:07.847
- They know better than to pull
any pranks in our house, right?

14:07.889 --> 14:09.099
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I'll throw

14:09.140 --> 14:11.017
both their Black asses out.
- Ha.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.562
[overlapping chatter]

14:14.604 --> 14:18.316
[mellow hip-hop]

14:18.358 --> 14:19.818
- There you go.
- Ha ha.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.444
- That's the one.
I like that one.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.822
[sound wind-down, wind-up]

14:23.863 --> 14:27.200
* *

14:27.242 --> 14:30.078
- Look at this!
- I need a photo right here.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.914
* *

14:32.956 --> 14:36.710
[indistinct chatter]

14:38.086 --> 14:39.921
- Come on, bro.
Usually curls up--

14:39.963 --> 14:43.216
Hilary, Hilary, how did you
make the artichokes?

14:43.258 --> 14:44.592
- Oven. The oven.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.177
[glassware clinking]
- Okay, they're fire.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.722
- Excuse me!
Excuse me, everyone.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.349
If I may, um...

14:52.308 --> 14:55.979
Tonight, you all welcome
our Hilary into your ranks.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.022
- Yeah, we do.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.066
[whooping]

15:00.108 --> 15:02.193
- Whoo!
- All right!

15:02.235 --> 15:05.739
- And our family
bids her goodbye.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.159
I just, um...

15:11.244 --> 15:12.746
I just wanted
to let Hilary know

15:12.787 --> 15:17.083
that she leaves our house
with our love.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.754
Honey bee, you are destined
for greatness.

15:22.297 --> 15:24.215
To Hilary.
- To Hilary!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.759
- To Hilary!
- Yay!

15:25.800 --> 15:27.761
- Yay!

15:27.802 --> 15:29.763
- Cheers.
- Yeah!

15:32.599 --> 15:34.684
- Yo, I thought
y'all was about to die

15:34.726 --> 15:36.561
when y'all was wrestling
with them wild lions.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.897
- Dude, you know we tranquilize
those lions, right?

15:38.938 --> 15:40.732
- [clicks tongue]
What? You lying.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.275
[laughs]

15:42.317 --> 15:44.152
I'm screwin' with you.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.530
Yo, how fast did that rocket
really go?

15:47.572 --> 15:48.782
- What?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.910
- Relax, bro.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.746
Relax, a'ight?

15:54.788 --> 15:58.708
I was just thinking
you must be happy, huh?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.419
- About what in particular?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.755
- I mean, shit will go back
to the way it was.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.883
This is basically
Will's goodbye party, too.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.968
Since Rashad got chalked out,

16:09.010 --> 16:11.388
my boy don't gotta hide
no more.

16:11.429 --> 16:17.102
- So...you don't think
that my parents and Will's mom

16:17.143 --> 16:19.187
overreacted sending Will
to Bel-Air?

16:19.229 --> 16:21.147
Like, Rashad was
really gonna hurt Will?

16:21.189 --> 16:23.566
- No doubt, bro.

16:23.608 --> 16:26.277
I was there when
they both got arrested,

16:26.319 --> 16:28.822
and Rashad had murder
in his eyes.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.615
Murder.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.410
Will was facing a lotta time
for those gun charges,

16:33.451 --> 16:37.956
but your DA daddy made
that shit disappear like magic.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.457
Shit was crazy, yo.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.292
- Hey, yo, Tray, bro,

16:41.334 --> 16:42.877
he said that they did
break the sound barrier

16:42.919 --> 16:44.629
when they built
that homemade rocket.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.214
I told you.
- He's lyin', bro.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.133
[voices fading]
Ain't no way.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.720
[heavy music]

16:56.307 --> 17:00.603
[chill R&B music]

17:00.645 --> 17:02.480
- I absolutely love
your necklace.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.149
- Oh, thank you.
It's from South Africa.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.110
When I was 19, I went there
on a trip for about four months

17:07.152 --> 17:10.363
for a cultural exchange program
for artists,

17:10.405 --> 17:12.323
and it changed the way

17:12.365 --> 17:14.325
I depicted light
in my paintings.

17:14.367 --> 17:18.204
And I had the chance to meet
President Nelson Mandela.

17:18.246 --> 17:20.040
- That must've been amazing.

17:20.081 --> 17:21.624
Have you ever considered
creating content

17:21.666 --> 17:23.418
about your travels?
- Oh, no.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.628
- I'm producing a series
about women who've been places

17:25.670 --> 17:27.839
that the average person
can only dream of.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.758
- What? No, no, no, no.
I'm not cut out

17:29.799 --> 17:32.969
to be a social media celebrity
like yourself.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.721
- Don't sell yourself short,
Mrs. Banks.

17:34.763 --> 17:36.723
You've got star energy.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.850
- Do you think the future
of sexuality is fluid?

17:38.892 --> 17:41.895
- I think coming generations
won't torture themselves

17:41.936 --> 17:44.147
when they define
their behaviors.

17:44.189 --> 17:48.568
Some people may spend one stage
of their lives as heterosexual

17:48.610 --> 17:53.114
and another as asexual and even
another as maybe homosexual.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.575
- So is it worth making
those distinctions at all?

17:55.617 --> 17:58.119
- Only if those distinctions
serve you.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.830
Some people feel that sexuality
defines them,

18:00.872 --> 18:03.583
you know, as a person.
Others don't.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.169
You know, but both camps
are totally correct.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.007
[chatter continues]

18:11.049 --> 18:17.847
* *

18:17.889 --> 18:19.599
- Please, please.
I'd love to, man.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.518
You know, I ball too,
so, you know--

18:21.559 --> 18:23.269
- Hey, hey.
My fault.

18:23.311 --> 18:27.732
Hey, Phanta, bro?
I'ma about to holler.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.026
- Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.
You been drinking?

18:30.068 --> 18:32.779
- Nah, nah.
- Hey, hey.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.989
- Just little tipsy.
- Hey, bro just go ahead.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.533
Drink some water.
Chill out.

18:36.574 --> 18:38.785
- I don't want no water.
- Come on, bro.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.708
- [sighs] Do you think
this is going well?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.001
Like this is going okay,
right?

18:46.042 --> 18:47.168
- Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's going great.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.253
You killed it.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.005
- Just Phanta
is obsessed with Mom.

18:50.046 --> 18:53.633
Kylo was talking Dad's ear off.
Maybe I should rescue him.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.594
- Uh...I think Dad
can fend for himself.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.514
- All right, Mr. Banks,
be real with me.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.599
You're running for office...
- Mm-hmm.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.061
- You don't wish that Hilary
was a lawyer

19:05.103 --> 19:07.063
or some professional type job
like that?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.648
This--
this whole influencer thing,

19:08.690 --> 19:10.358
this doesn't bother you
at all?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.110
- Let me tell you something
about Hilary.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.946
She was born
two months premature.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.615
Spent the first six weeks
of her life in the NIC unit.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.326
She was so small.
So fragile.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.997
I just prayed
for her to be healthy.

19:24.039 --> 19:25.915
Prayed for her
to have a full life.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.084
My heart hasn't changed.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.254
I want her to continue
to grow, to thrive,

19:31.296 --> 19:33.298
and I put
no other conditions on her.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.302
So, no, I'm not bothered.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.346
I'm proud.

19:39.387 --> 19:43.183
- Well, damn, Mr. Banks,
I kinda wish you were my dad.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.225
both: [chuckle]

19:48.438 --> 19:49.898
- What the hell?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
this shit moving.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.486
[dramatic music]

19:54.527 --> 19:55.779
[loud clattering]
all: [gasp]

19:55.820 --> 19:57.113
- Hilary, tell your friends

19:57.155 --> 19:58.490
to call off the prank,
right now.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.325
- It's not a prank, ma'am.
It's a gift for Hilary.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.534
all: Whoa, whoa.

20:01.576 --> 20:02.744
- Go on and open it.
- Oh, sh--

20:02.786 --> 20:04.371
- Whoa!

20:04.412 --> 20:06.956
[intense music escalating]

20:06.998 --> 20:09.376
- Oh--
- Got it lit!

20:09.417 --> 20:11.086
- Oh...
- Oh!

20:11.127 --> 20:13.254
- Oh, whoa!
- Now, that's a prank.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.799
[commotion, exclamations]

20:17.676 --> 20:19.469
- You should've seen
your faces.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.346
- That was hilarious!

20:21.388 --> 20:23.723
- Excuse me a moment.
- You did it again.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.183
- We got another one.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.394
- Cut the camera off, please.
Like seriously.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.020
- Hey, man, cut the camera--
cut the camera, bro.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.023
- [exhales heavily]

20:34.943 --> 20:36.361
- Dad, we need to talk.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.699
Did you pull strings to get
Will out of jail in Philly?

20:44.869 --> 20:45.995
- Close the door
and we'll talk.

20:46.037 --> 20:50.125
[mellow music playing]

20:50.166 --> 20:51.710
- You're not too mad are you?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.003
- No.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.171
- This all seems normal to you?

20:55.213 --> 20:58.299
- No, but that's the point.
It's work.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.926
Theater, if you will.

20:59.968 --> 21:02.637
- Oh, it's art. Huh.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.806
- Catch you later, Will.
- Sure, be easy.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.392
[sighs]

21:10.812 --> 21:12.313
Jetlag getting you brah?

21:12.355 --> 21:15.316
- Ha. That wine
tuckin' me in, too, bro.

21:15.358 --> 21:17.277
- Come on, bro.
Gotta get you some rest, boul.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.362
We got a long week
ahead of us.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.867
[mellow rap music]

21:23.908 --> 21:28.663
* *

21:28.705 --> 21:31.207
- So you broke the law
for him.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.463
- If I didn't intervene,

21:36.504 --> 21:38.465
Will would've gone to prison.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.592
His future ruined.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.218
Understand, son,

21:42.260 --> 21:44.512
that if our situation
came to light...

21:46.848 --> 21:48.516
Will wouldn't be
the only one that suffers.

21:50.518 --> 21:54.731
- So all those lectures
you gave me about justice

21:54.773 --> 21:56.733
and following the rules
and doing the right thing--

21:56.775 --> 21:58.151
that was all bullshit?

21:59.152 --> 22:01.988
- People make mistakes, son.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.158
They fall down, and...

22:05.200 --> 22:07.077
they deserve a chance
to get back on their feet.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.912
Didn't we teach you that?

22:08.953 --> 22:11.247
Haven't your own struggles
taught you that?

22:11.289 --> 22:14.918
- Are you seriously equating
my anxiety disorder

22:14.959 --> 22:16.586
with Will's crime?

22:16.628 --> 22:17.962
- No.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.965
No, I'm--

22:21.007 --> 22:24.552
I'm saying that everyone
needs to be shown some grace.

22:24.594 --> 22:25.929
That's what we did for Will.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.223
- No, no, 'cause if you
did the right thing,

22:28.264 --> 22:30.058
you wouldn't be sitting here
asking me to keep it a secret.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.477
- Whoa, Carlton--Carlton!

22:34.020 --> 22:36.147
I need your word that
you'll keep this between us.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.150
- [exhales heavily]

22:39.192 --> 22:40.485
Yeah.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.197
You have my word.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.910
'Cause it's actually worth
something.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.871
[tense music]

22:51.913 --> 22:59.129
* *

23:00.422 --> 23:01.965
[door opens]

23:02.007 --> 23:04.009
- You're so full of shit,
Will.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.885
- Negro,
wasn't you just up my ass

23:05.927 --> 23:06.845
about knocking first?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.013
- Oh, I'm sorry.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.432
You gonna
pull a gun on me too?

23:11.641 --> 23:13.393
You don't have anything to say?

23:16.229 --> 23:17.814
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:17.856 --> 23:19.065
- I know about the gun.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.525
I know about the fight.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.985
And the part where my dad
broke the law

23:22.027 --> 23:23.278
to get you out of jail.

23:23.319 --> 23:24.487
- Carlton...

23:25.739 --> 23:27.323
Please don't snitch.

23:27.741 --> 23:31.286
- Then stay out of my way
at home and at school.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.707
And stay the fuck
away from Lisa.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.377
She doesn't deserve to get
pulled into your bullshit.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.255
[door slams]

23:46.968 --> 23:50.180
- Oh, hey, come on now.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.556
One more, one more.
Let's see it again.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.974
- That one's not ready.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.769
- Uhh!
Oh, please.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.062
- Four times.
- Jeez.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.897
[overlapping chatter]

23:58.938 --> 24:01.191
- I want that one.
- Serve my brother.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.026
Okay, Unc, I didn't know
you had it like that.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.652
- You used to work at IHOP
or something, Unc?

24:04.694 --> 24:06.488
- No, I was stuck with
Sunday morning kitchen duty

24:06.529 --> 24:08.865
in the fraternity house.
It was trial by fire.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.533
- Um, good morning!

24:10.575 --> 24:13.286
- Hey, how you doing, baby?
I hope you hungry.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.747
- Oh, well, what do
we owe the honor?

24:16.539 --> 24:18.500
- There ain't no reason.
I just want to feed my family.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.751
- Oh, I'm here for that.

24:19.793 --> 24:20.710
- He's no Hilary,
but he's cool.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.128
- Hey.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.674
- Morning.
- Good morning, son.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.883
You want two or three?

24:26.925 --> 24:28.677
I know how much
you love my flapjacks.

24:28.718 --> 24:30.428
- I'm good.
Lisa's coming over,

24:30.470 --> 24:33.390
and we have a busy day planning
her mom's memorial benefit.

24:33.431 --> 24:35.225
- Let her know that she can
have the entire house.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.268
And whatever she needs,
we'll provide.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.770
- Aw, thanks, Mom.

24:39.771 --> 24:40.814
- You are gonna
be done in time

24:40.855 --> 24:42.399
to join us
for the concert, right?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.025
- No, I'll pass.

24:44.067 --> 24:47.028
Lisa and I
have a lot to discuss.

24:47.070 --> 24:50.365
[lightly moody music]

- Flip it!

24:55.078 --> 24:57.414
- Flip it!
- Oh!

24:57.455 --> 24:59.499
- Hold it, hold it, hold it,

25:05.588 --> 25:07.298
- Bro, you gotta
come out here, though, man.

25:07.340 --> 25:09.134
Like we'll make it happen, bro.
It's big enough.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.510
I could talk
to my aunt and uncle.

25:10.552 --> 25:13.013
- I don't know, bro.
You family. I'm just friends.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.140
They not gonna let me
live off them for months.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.475
- Oh, oh, go, go this way,
go this way, go this way.

- Yo, what's good?
I'm Tray.

25:21.688 --> 25:22.939
You must be Lisa, huh?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.607

Come on, man.
Uncle Phil's waiting for us.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.117
Come on.

- Enjoy the concert.

25:36.745 --> 25:38.413
- Bye.

25:39.414 --> 25:41.458
What's with Will?
He seems off.

25:42.417 --> 25:43.376
- Who knows?

25:43.418 --> 25:45.211
Want to get back
to the guest list?

25:45.253 --> 25:47.255
- Sure.

Hey, you hip enough,

all-access passes.

- All-access passes.
- VIP.

What, bro?

I can't even believe we really

for boul, starting with

26:39.599 --> 26:41.142
when he gonna
drop his next album?

That last one had no skips.

26:42.727 --> 26:45.271
- None! No skips at all.

who D Smoke is.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.574

Big cap.
- Up on the game.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.413
Hey, don't get me--don't get
me started, right?

27:01.454 --> 27:03.790
- What's up, fellas?
You all ready for the show?

27:03.832 --> 27:05.291
- D Smoke.
- Hell, yeah.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.043
Yeah, yeah, we fuck
with your music, man.

27:07.085 --> 27:08.753
My name is Will.
This my boy, Tray.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.588
- Nice to meet you, Will.
- Tray.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.881
You must be Uncle Phil.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.174
- Mucho gusto.
- You are the man.

27:13.216 --> 27:14.968
- Yeah, tu sabes.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.429
- You D Smoke.
- Yeah.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.973
- Yeah, Tray actually put me
on to your music.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.307
- Okay.
- Yeah, tell him, Tray.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.726
Tell him, Tray.
- Okay. Okay.

27:22.767 --> 27:24.019
Good lookin'.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.729
- You D Smoke!

27:25.770 --> 27:27.230
- Yeah.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.231
- He normally doesn't
stop talking.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.275
You got him star-struck.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.902
- Your boy.
- It's really D Smoke.

27:32.944 --> 27:34.446
[laughter]

27:34.487 --> 27:37.490
[chill R&B music]

27:37.532 --> 27:43.663
* *

27:43.705 --> 27:46.416
* Yeah uh uh *

27:46.458 --> 27:49.169
* Woke up on the other side
of the bed...*

27:49.210 --> 27:52.130
- I'm so glad Joan
convinced you to come in.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.506
What do you think?

27:53.548 --> 27:55.008
- * Need a little
positive truth *

27:55.050 --> 27:57.302
* Brothers who need
a little confidence too...*

27:57.344 --> 27:59.095
- I just love her use of color.

27:59.137 --> 28:02.390
It's just so...

28:02.432 --> 28:05.101
strong and un-unapologetic.

28:05.143 --> 28:08.938
* *

28:08.980 --> 28:10.565
- It's, um...

28:12.233 --> 28:14.611
It's complex yet clear.

28:14.652 --> 28:18.239
Intimate but powerful.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.409
Simply riveting.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.913
Your work is
in a similar vein.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.582
Your color palette
is evocative.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.837
The way you, uh...

28:32.879 --> 28:35.131
draw in the viewers' eyes...

28:35.173 --> 28:37.342
not lying when I say
I could stare

28:37.384 --> 28:40.178
into your paintings for hours,
because I've done it.

28:44.015 --> 28:46.267
- I'm glad you enjoy
my work, Reid.

28:48.353 --> 28:52.107
So what exactly
did Joan say I'm doing?

28:54.526 --> 28:56.695
- She told me
that Vivian Smith is, uh--

28:56.736 --> 29:00.240
excuse me, Vivian Banks
is painting again.

29:03.827 --> 29:08.373
And I've always, always been
enamored with your work.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.128
- I appreciate that.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.256
I'm not sure I'm ready

29:16.297 --> 29:18.925
just to show
any of my latest pieces yet.

29:19.634 --> 29:21.845
- Why don't you just show me
what you got

29:21.886 --> 29:23.638
and let me be the judge?

29:27.058 --> 29:28.518
Now this...

29:30.270 --> 29:32.230
This is what
I really wanted you to see.

29:35.775 --> 29:37.068
- I mean,
whoever did this,

29:37.110 --> 29:39.738
this is way too minimalistic
for my taste, so...

29:44.075 --> 29:47.328
- This space is reserved
for you, Vivian.

29:47.370 --> 29:50.290
- What?
No.

29:51.541 --> 29:53.835
I'm not ready
for all of this.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.212
I mean,
I haven't even been able to...

29:56.254 --> 29:58.798
to tap
into my creative flow.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.427
- Hm.

30:08.641 --> 30:12.896
There's never a right time,
okay?

30:12.937 --> 30:14.606
You just gotta go.

30:16.441 --> 30:18.651
If you wait until
you think you're ready...

30:23.073 --> 30:25.241
Another 15 years
might pass you by.

30:31.206 --> 30:34.292
- D Smoke, let's go--
D Smoke, let's go.

30:34.334 --> 30:37.629
- VIP, baby.
Don't you know about VIP?

30:37.671 --> 30:39.506
[phone buzzes]

30:39.547 --> 30:41.758
- Yo, fellas--fellas,
why don't you go up inside?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.760
I just gonna take care of some
business here first, okay?

30:43.802 --> 30:45.303
- A'ight Uncle Phil.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.805
Yeah, let's get it.

30:55.188 --> 30:57.482
- Congressman Turley.
Fred.

30:57.524 --> 31:00.235
I didn't take either one of you
for D Smoke fans.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.695
- Phil, we've come here

31:01.736 --> 31:03.113
to help you
right your campaign.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.989
You're at a critical juncture.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.491
- Well, I'm up in the polls.

31:06.533 --> 31:08.159
I'd be happy to walk you
through the numbers.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.911
- Polls don't tell
the whole story.

31:09.953 --> 31:13.456
Not everyone liked the comments
you made about law enforcement.

31:13.498 --> 31:15.250
You said "defund the police."

31:15.291 --> 31:17.293
- Oh, come on, Fred.
We both know

31:17.335 --> 31:18.586
that the police budget
could shed millions

31:18.628 --> 31:19.796
and rank and file
wouldn't feel the difference.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.256
- Well, that's where
the argument starts,

31:21.297 --> 31:22.799
but where does it end?
- With a police force

31:22.841 --> 31:24.801
that doesn't act
like it's above the law.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.512
- Phil, we didn't come here
to debate this with you.

31:27.554 --> 31:29.389
You need to tone down
your rhetoric.

31:30.724 --> 31:33.018
- Or what?

31:33.059 --> 31:34.310
- There will be consequences

31:34.352 --> 31:36.062
for this new direction
you're taking.

31:36.104 --> 31:38.064
- Noted.

31:38.106 --> 31:40.233
But I still stand
by what I said.

31:40.275 --> 31:41.359
Now, if you'll excuse me,

31:41.401 --> 31:44.362
I got a concert to enjoy.
All right.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.581
- Ash, this is for you.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.583
It's from my homegirl,
Phanta.

31:56.624 --> 31:58.418
She created a jewelry line,
and she wanted you and Mom

31:58.460 --> 31:59.794
to have pieces
from the collection.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.713
- Cool.
Tell her I said thanks.

32:01.755 --> 32:04.132
- Okay. Oh, and the charm is
for, like, good fortunate--

32:04.174 --> 32:06.468
Like money, health, love.

32:06.509 --> 32:07.927
- How does that work?

32:07.969 --> 32:09.095
- Girl, it doesn't.

32:09.137 --> 32:11.473
It's a sales hook,
but it's pretty,

32:11.514 --> 32:13.475
and it won't turn
your wrist green.

32:13.516 --> 32:17.479
- Hil, so I have this friend
that I have a crush on.

32:18.897 --> 32:22.150
And I think this friend
likes me but hasn't said that.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.401
What do I do?

32:23.443 --> 32:24.736
- Does a friend have a name?

32:28.198 --> 32:29.616
- Lucia.

32:31.701 --> 32:34.537
- That's a pretty name.
Tell me more about her.

32:34.996 --> 32:37.832
- Well, she's an 8th grader.
She's smart.

32:37.874 --> 32:39.584
She has a nerdy
sense of humor like me.

32:39.626 --> 32:41.544
She doesn't take crap
from anyone.

32:42.837 --> 32:45.006
Are you surprised?

32:45.048 --> 32:47.842
- I mean, I'm surprised you're
having feelings for somebody

32:47.884 --> 32:50.887
since you're always so busy
trying to save the world.

32:50.929 --> 32:54.599
But, no, I'm not surprised
that you're gay.

32:54.641 --> 32:55.850
- I mean,
I'm attracted to girls,

32:55.892 --> 32:57.686
but I haven't totally
ruled out boys.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.270
Which is why I'm afraid
to tell Mom and Dad,

32:59.312 --> 33:01.189
because I haven't
got it figured out.

33:01.231 --> 33:02.357
And I don't want
them to think

33:02.399 --> 33:04.567
that I'm just in
some phase, you know?

33:04.609 --> 33:07.987
- You're 12. You don't have
to have everything figured out,

33:08.029 --> 33:10.365
and you don't have to tell
anybody if you don't want to.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.492
But I'm happy you told me.

33:14.411 --> 33:15.745
- I'm gonna really
miss you, Hil.

33:16.538 --> 33:18.373
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

33:18.415 --> 33:22.836
And look, I'll always be here
if you ever need to talk, okay?

33:22.877 --> 33:23.878
Give me hug.

33:26.423 --> 33:28.925
I love you, sis.
- I love you too.

33:28.967 --> 33:31.011
- Okay.
Bye.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.430
[overlapping conversations]

33:37.434 --> 33:38.643
- Excuse me--excuse me.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.186
Lovin' the hat, brother.
That's hard.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.397
[chatter, laughter]

33:42.439 --> 33:45.066
Oh, my God, yo.
This is the life.

33:45.108 --> 33:47.402
- Facts, bro.
- [laughs]

33:47.444 --> 33:49.821
Yo, if I stayed
out here all year,

33:49.863 --> 33:51.448
you can visit
anytime you want, bro.

33:51.489 --> 33:53.450
Summer break, spring break,
winter break, bro.

33:53.491 --> 33:55.035
All the breaks.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.375
- Is that what
you trying to do?

34:02.417 --> 34:05.045
You trying to stay
in LA forever?

34:05.086 --> 34:06.379
- No.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.425
I mean...

34:10.467 --> 34:12.344
I don't know, maybe.

34:12.385 --> 34:15.764
- Don't play me, bro.
You know.

34:16.348 --> 34:17.599
You really trying
to turn your back

34:17.640 --> 34:18.641
on where you came from?

34:18.683 --> 34:20.727
- Whoa, bro, slow down.

34:20.769 --> 34:23.146
All I said is I might
maybe stay in LA.

34:23.188 --> 34:24.606
- Ain't no might
maybe to it, bro.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.609
I know you.
You already made your mind up.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.444
Just admit the shit.

34:29.486 --> 34:30.612
- Look, bro,
I'm just trying to

34:30.653 --> 34:31.905
figure this shit out, a'ight?

34:31.946 --> 34:34.491
Man, I need you
to get off my back, a'ight?

34:34.532 --> 34:36.076
Bro, you don't understand.
This is--is--

34:36.117 --> 34:37.285
- No, I don't understand.

34:37.327 --> 34:38.495
You was the one calling me

34:38.536 --> 34:39.746
talking about
how everyone in LA

34:39.788 --> 34:41.623
was treating you wack,
crying and shit.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.500
- Who was crying?
- Nigga, you.

34:43.541 --> 34:45.460
[sniveling] "Tray, everyone
in Bel-Air's wack.

34:45.502 --> 34:47.170
I gotta get on back to Philly."

34:47.212 --> 34:48.463
Now you wanna be one of 'em.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.966
- Tray, look around you.

34:52.008 --> 34:55.178
What do we have in Philly
that's better than this, hmm?

34:55.220 --> 34:56.638
- Ladies and gentlemen,

34:56.680 --> 34:58.473
please get ready
to make some noise.

34:58.515 --> 35:01.017
The show is about to begin.

35:01.059 --> 35:03.645
[cheers and applause]

35:03.687 --> 35:06.189
- Man, you ain't nothing
but a fucking liar, bro.

35:07.232 --> 35:10.944
All day--all day you been
talking about coming back home.

35:10.985 --> 35:14.322
For our team.
For our block. For me.

35:14.364 --> 35:16.157
But fuck us, right?

35:16.199 --> 35:18.743
You got yours, so fuck Philly.

35:20.662 --> 35:22.539
- LA, how you all feelin'?

35:22.580 --> 35:25.750
[cheers and applause]

35:25.792 --> 35:27.043
- Tray.

35:29.754 --> 35:31.548
- My name is D Smoke.

35:31.589 --> 35:33.049
I'm from Inglewood,
California.

35:33.091 --> 35:35.343
We about to do this shit.
Y'all put your hands up.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.847
[cheers and applause]

35:38.888 --> 35:41.891
DJ Shanks, let's do this!

35:41.933 --> 35:43.977
- The whole time.

35:44.019 --> 35:45.895
[both laughing]

35:45.937 --> 35:48.148
- [murmuring]

35:48.189 --> 35:51.276
- Wait, um, why
the Mardi Gras theme?

35:51.860 --> 35:54.154
- So when my mom was a girl,
she used to visit

35:54.195 --> 35:56.906
her family in New Orleans
during Mardi Gras.

35:56.948 --> 35:58.658
And she loved it.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.453
The people,
the music, the food.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.330
- Well, then that's it.

36:04.372 --> 36:06.499
We'll bring the Mardi Gras
to the Banks estate.

36:06.541 --> 36:09.044
Anything you can dream up,
we can do.

36:10.086 --> 36:11.588
- Carlton, are you sure
about this?

36:11.629 --> 36:14.424
- Hey, of course.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.968
Look, I loved your mother.

36:17.010 --> 36:21.056
- Oh, thank you,
Carlton, so much.

36:21.097 --> 36:23.141
This means so much to me.

36:23.183 --> 36:26.144
[chill music]

36:26.186 --> 36:33.109
* *

36:34.778 --> 36:37.739
Whoa, whoa.
Carlton.

36:37.781 --> 36:40.784
- Uh, I'm--I'm sorry.
I--I just thought--

36:44.120 --> 36:46.956
- Carlton, my feelings
haven't changed.

36:46.998 --> 36:49.584
- Um, yeah, no, I get it.
I'm sorry.

36:49.626 --> 36:51.211
I just, um...

37:01.471 --> 37:04.474
[pacing footsteps]

37:10.438 --> 37:13.358
- So what's up, bro?
You ain't got nothing to say?

37:13.400 --> 37:14.943
- I just need my charger, bro.

37:19.989 --> 37:22.117
- Bro, we can't be beefing
like this the whole week.

37:22.158 --> 37:24.160
- [scoffs]
Shit, if I stay the week.

37:26.496 --> 37:28.957
- Oh, that's how you feel?

37:28.998 --> 37:30.875
That you don't want
to be here no more?

37:30.917 --> 37:32.961
- How am I supposed
to act, bro?

37:33.003 --> 37:35.797
You want to level up
and leave my broke ass behind.

37:35.839 --> 37:37.465
You thought
I'd be cool with that shit

37:37.507 --> 37:39.467
if I went to Disneyland first?

37:39.509 --> 37:42.387
- Tray, we supposed to be boys.

37:42.429 --> 37:43.638
You supposed to be
happy for me

37:43.680 --> 37:45.223
when some great shit
comes in my life.

37:45.265 --> 37:47.517
- Because you
the special one, huh?

37:47.559 --> 37:49.144
I forgot.

37:49.185 --> 37:50.937
You gonna go off
and do big-time shit

37:50.979 --> 37:52.480
and what, I'm just
supposed to sit around

37:52.522 --> 37:54.566
and wait for you
to tell me about it?

37:54.607 --> 37:56.609
Is that it, Will?

37:56.651 --> 38:00.155
Oh, 'cause you the GOAT, huh?

38:00.947 --> 38:02.282
Yeah.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.493
Nigga, your ass was the one
who got thrown in jail.

38:05.535 --> 38:06.828
- Tray, I got thrown in jail

38:06.870 --> 38:08.747
trying to save your ass
from getting jumped.

38:08.788 --> 38:10.081
And whose gun was it, anyway?

38:10.123 --> 38:12.334
- We wasn't even supposed
to be there, Will.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.169
Remember that?

38:15.420 --> 38:18.006
Darnell clowned your ass
in front of the papi store,

38:18.048 --> 38:19.883
and you just couldn't
let that go, could you?

38:19.924 --> 38:22.844
- I learned from it.
I learned from it.

38:22.886 --> 38:25.013
'Cause I'm the one that got
snatched up out of Philly

38:25.055 --> 38:26.348
and sent out here to Bel-Air.

38:26.389 --> 38:29.059
Me. Not you, me.

38:30.852 --> 38:33.730
- Nigga, you got rich...

38:35.482 --> 38:37.192
And I got fucking shot--

38:37.233 --> 38:38.151
shot, nigga.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.365
- Tray, hold on.

38:43.406 --> 38:45.158
- Don't fucking touch me, bro.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.370
[tense music]

38:48.411 --> 38:53.833
* *

38:53.875 --> 38:54.918
- Get the fuck
out of my room!

38:54.959 --> 38:57.796
- Fuck you, Bel-Air pussy.

38:57.837 --> 39:00.131
- Get the fuck out!

39:00.173 --> 39:07.055
* *

39:19.984 --> 39:24.280
[soft R&B playing]

39:24.322 --> 39:31.246
* *

39:50.890 --> 39:54.185
- Hey, Auntie,
you got a second?

39:54.227 --> 39:55.854
- Yeah, baby.

39:55.895 --> 39:58.064
Well, what's the matter?

39:58.106 --> 40:00.817
- [sighs]
Me and Tray got into it.

40:00.859 --> 40:03.653
- Oh, baby, that happens
sometimes with friends.

40:03.695 --> 40:05.488
- No, this is different though.

40:05.530 --> 40:06.656
Tray's my day one.

40:06.698 --> 40:08.366
We've been homies
since my dad left.

40:08.408 --> 40:13.038
But after today, I don't know
if we can be boys anymore.

40:13.079 --> 40:16.833
- Baby, you and Tray
were sent on different paths

40:16.875 --> 40:18.835
the night you were arrested.

40:18.877 --> 40:22.881
That was traumatic
for both of you.

40:22.922 --> 40:25.050
And both of you
are processing it differently.

40:25.091 --> 40:28.011
You're not little boys anymore.

40:34.726 --> 40:36.144
- Anyways, um...

40:38.229 --> 40:41.066
Tray wants to
leave early and go home.

40:45.362 --> 40:46.279
- Congratulations.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.405
You're the talk
of the internet.

40:47.447 --> 40:49.032
- In a good way or bad way?
- Both.

40:49.074 --> 40:51.368
Your interview with Kylo
went viral.

40:51.409 --> 40:52.911
Positive feedback though.

40:52.952 --> 40:54.913
- When the hell
did he interview me?

40:56.081 --> 40:58.500
She was born
two months premature.

40:58.541 --> 41:00.960
Spent the first six weeks
of her life in the NIC unit.

41:01.002 --> 41:02.545
She was so small.

41:02.587 --> 41:05.507
I forgot we were recording.
- I'm glad you did.

41:05.548 --> 41:07.467
It humanized you
with the public.

41:07.509 --> 41:08.593
Ready for the bad?

41:08.635 --> 41:10.595
- Prayed for her
to have a full life.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.180
And my heart hasn't changed--

41:12.806 --> 41:15.058
And if you vote for me
as your new District Attorney,

41:15.100 --> 41:17.894
I promise that justice for all
will be a reality.

41:17.936 --> 41:19.187
- Phillip Bank says

41:19.229 --> 41:20.438
he's the candidate
of the people.

41:20.480 --> 41:22.857
What people?
Law-abiding citizens

41:22.899 --> 41:24.109
or rioters?

41:24.150 --> 41:26.403
Everyday people
or the radical left?

41:26.444 --> 41:27.529
Decide for yourself.

41:27.570 --> 41:29.072
- Defunding the police
is critical.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.365
[echoing] critical...
critical...critical...

41:30.407 --> 41:32.450
- Does Los Angeles
need a District Attorney

41:32.492 --> 41:33.576
who is anti-police?

41:33.618 --> 41:35.120
- Defunding the police
is critical.

41:36.663 --> 41:38.456
Un-fucking-believable.

41:38.498 --> 41:40.166
They're painting me
like a member of Antifa.

41:40.208 --> 41:42.544
- It's because you played it
too far to the left.

41:42.585 --> 41:45.088
This is exactly
why Judge Robertson and I

41:45.130 --> 41:47.257
told you run a moderate,
centrist campaign.

41:47.298 --> 41:49.634
- Well, that advice
was not working, Steven.

41:49.676 --> 41:51.094
My support was tepid.

41:51.136 --> 41:54.514
- It was a rational approach.
- I was losing.

41:54.556 --> 41:56.266
Now I'm up in the polls
and I'm being attacked

41:56.307 --> 41:58.685
because I could win.
I'm dangerous.

41:58.727 --> 42:01.146
These attacks can be overcome
if we turn out the vote.

42:02.605 --> 42:04.149
- It's dicey, Phil.

42:05.608 --> 42:07.485
My donors may panic.

42:07.527 --> 42:09.320
- Yeah. Well...

42:09.362 --> 42:11.448
at least I have
my own millions.

42:11.489 --> 42:12.741
It's good thing.

42:12.782 --> 42:16.619
[tense music]

42:16.661 --> 42:18.329
* *

42:27.672 --> 42:29.424
- You don't have to leave, bro.

42:29.466 --> 42:31.343
- Yeah, I do.

42:42.312 --> 42:46.316
And what the fuck
would I stay for, huh?

42:47.984 --> 42:50.570
You like being
their little charity case,

42:50.612 --> 42:52.530
but not me, bro.

42:52.572 --> 42:55.325
I can't buy into this shit,
man...

42:57.535 --> 42:59.287
And go home soft.

42:59.329 --> 43:01.206
- Tray, you know I'm not soft.

43:03.458 --> 43:05.168
I just realized

43:05.210 --> 43:08.046
that there's more
to the world than West Philly.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.352
- Not to me, bro.

43:32.821 --> 43:34.489
[engine turns over]

43:44.124 --> 43:46.209
- Aw, this is so lovely.
Oh!

43:46.251 --> 43:49.045
- You don't have to wear it
if you don't want to, Mom.

43:49.087 --> 43:51.297
It's Phanta's thing.
It's not mine.

43:51.339 --> 43:53.633
- Oh, why would you think
I don't like it?

43:53.675 --> 43:57.387
- Because it's the way
you said, "This is lovely."

43:57.846 --> 43:59.681
I know what that tone means.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.728
- Do I always sound
so critical?

44:04.769 --> 44:06.312
- Not always.

44:07.897 --> 44:10.066
But often.

44:12.610 --> 44:14.487
- Well, I shouldn't...

44:14.529 --> 44:16.364
always just say
the critical things.

44:16.406 --> 44:18.950
I mean, I feel
so much, much more.

44:23.413 --> 44:26.624
Honey, I want you to know
I am proud of you.

44:26.666 --> 44:29.461
You are forging a new path
and I can't--oh--

[soft music]

44:32.630 --> 44:36.009

44:36.051 --> 44:38.011
- That's all I wanted
to hear, Mom.

44:38.720 --> 44:42.098
- Well, let me say it again.
I am proud of you.

44:42.140 --> 44:44.559
I am so, so proud of you.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.438
- Thank you.

44:52.734 --> 44:54.194
And Mom, listen.
- Mm-hmm.

44:54.235 --> 44:55.528
- When I join Kylo's crew,

44:55.570 --> 44:57.572
it's really gonna
launch my career.

44:57.614 --> 44:59.324
I'm gonna keep
making you proud.

45:01.326 --> 45:04.037
- I'm already proud of you.

- Hey, Ma.

45:21.304 --> 45:22.972
- Hey, baby!

45:23.014 --> 45:25.350
You know, you caught me right
before I walked into work.

45:25.392 --> 45:27.352
Listen, I've been
trying to think about

45:27.394 --> 45:28.728
when to bring you home.

45:28.770 --> 45:30.230
The coach, he wants you
back yesterday,

45:30.271 --> 45:32.023
and the scouts,
they're still interested.

45:32.065 --> 45:33.733
It'll be like you never left.

45:33.775 --> 45:36.611
- I was thinking, uh...
what if I stayed?

45:36.653 --> 45:40.365
- What you mean stay?
Will, Philly's your home.

45:41.700 --> 45:45.245
Everyone here loves you.
Understands you.

45:45.286 --> 45:49.332
- Yeah, I know, Ma,
but, you know,

45:49.374 --> 45:50.709
it's the middle
of the school year

45:50.750 --> 45:52.669
and I made friends.

45:52.711 --> 45:55.588
- Son, hasn't it always been
just you and me?

45:57.173 --> 45:59.092
You know, facing
whatever we had to?

45:59.968 --> 46:02.095
- Yeah.

46:02.137 --> 46:04.055
- I know you've come
such a long way.

46:04.097 --> 46:06.641
I--I get that you feel grown.

46:09.394 --> 46:11.312
But you still need me.

46:11.354 --> 46:15.150
- I do, but I...
also need to

46:15.191 --> 46:17.819
figure out
what's out here for me.

46:17.861 --> 46:20.321
Ma, you told me, right?

46:20.363 --> 46:22.365
My life is more than
the 14 square miles

46:22.407 --> 46:24.868
that I grew up in in Philly.

46:24.909 --> 46:27.287
That my crown is waiting for me

46:27.328 --> 46:30.582
as soon as I find
the courage to wear it, right?

46:30.623 --> 46:31.583
- Yeah.

46:33.043 --> 46:34.419
- Well, I'm ready, Ma.

46:38.214 --> 46:40.300
- All right.

46:40.342 --> 46:43.428
I've always supported you,
and I always will.

46:47.432 --> 46:48.683
I gotta get
back to work, okay?

46:48.725 --> 46:50.518
But w--we'll talk later,
okay?

46:51.978 --> 46:54.689
- Okay.
I love you, Ma.

46:56.149 --> 46:58.777
- I love you.
All right.
