00:08.258 --> 00:10.093
[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

00:10.176 --> 00:14.222
I'm so glad that you're home safe
and that the babies are okay.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.642
-He's transferring to Southside High.
-I'm not a Serpent.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.311
It might be my dad's life, but not mine.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.522
[Archie] You get shot.
Ms. Grundy's murdered.

00:22.605 --> 00:26.651
What if some crazy person is going
after the people that I care about?

00:29.195 --> 00:31.948
[Jughead] Every fairy tale comes
with the same warning:

00:32.782 --> 00:36.619
Good children should never go
into the woods alone.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.374
Stray from the path
and who knows what you'll encounter.

00:43.585 --> 00:44.711
A hungry wolf.

00:46.337 --> 00:47.380
A handsome devil.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.637
Or maybe something worse.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.889
[gunshots]

01:00.435 --> 01:03.229
[Midge] Help! Help! Help me, please!

01:03.855 --> 01:05.815
Help! Help!

01:07.776 --> 01:11.613
Oh, I can take that in to Daddy.
I wanna ask him something, anyway.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.656
Your father and I have business
to discuss.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.743
-You know the rules about his study.
-Mom, those were the old rules.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.661
[Hermione] Which still apply, Veronica.

01:19.204 --> 01:22.248
I thought I heard my two palomitas
out here chirping.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.459
Is that my café con leche?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.668
Thank you, corazón.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.880
[Veronica] Tonight's the season premiere
of The Matchlerette.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.757
I would love to have my friends over.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.675
-[Hiram] Who exactly?
-Inner circle only.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.260
Hmm.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.096
You can watch with us.
They're dying to meet you.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.974
-They're welcome to come over, mija.
-Thank you, Daddy.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.559
-[Hiram] Mm-hm.
-Mwah.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.730
[players chattering]

01:47.524 --> 01:50.360
Are we gonna start or what?
Where's Coach Clayton?

01:50.443 --> 01:52.987
-At the hospital with Moose and Midge.
-What?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.157
-Hey, guys!
-[Reggie] I only know what coach told me.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.912
Moose got shot multiple times
by some lunatic at Lovers' Lane.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.332
-Oh, my God--
-No, Arch, he's alive. So's Midge.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.710
He, like, shielded her with his body.
She didn't get hit.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.462
Practice is canceled.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.344
[Ethel] You don't think
they're targeting students, do you?

02:16.427 --> 02:19.097
Should we be worried?
Like, what's going on?

02:19.180 --> 02:21.599
[Keller] It was full-on Carrie.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.228
Midge covered in Moose's blood,
screaming like a banshee.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.229
It was insane.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.731
Kev, what were you even doing there?

02:28.815 --> 02:31.401
[Kevin] I was just night-jogging,
you know, as one does,

02:31.484 --> 02:33.444
and suddenly, I hear gunshots.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.281
Can we agree there's a killer
on the loose?

02:36.364 --> 02:39.617
-With terrible aim.
-Jughead, he murdered Ms. Grundy.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.120
We don't know
these three crimes are related.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.747
Guys, can we focus
on what matters here?

02:44.831 --> 02:47.584
Midge and Moose are alive.
Archie's dad survived.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.462
The Matchlerette starts tonight.
You're coming over to watch.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.007
There's a shooter terrorizing the town.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.718
You really want us
to watch a gross dating show?

02:56.801 --> 03:00.013
What I want is for you guys
to meet my dad officially.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.349
Back in New York,
my dad was always in his study,

03:03.433 --> 03:05.435
doing bad things, as it turns out.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.979
I'm tired of closed doors.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.190
I need to know my dad's life
and he needs to know mine.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.985
-Well, we'll be there, V. Can't wait.
-Thank you.

03:14.068 --> 03:17.864
Hey, Andrews, we're going to the
hospital to see Moose. You coming?

03:17.947 --> 03:20.658
Yeah, for sure.
I'll see you tonight, Ronnie.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.328
I better go.
Was supposed to meet my peer mentor

03:23.411 --> 03:26.164
-at Southside High half an hour ago.
-Wait, are--?

03:26.706 --> 03:30.668
Are you sure
you can't just keep going here?

03:31.169 --> 03:32.128
I'll be fine.

03:34.714 --> 03:35.548
[Betty] Bye.

03:40.094 --> 03:44.724
Okay, it's just us now. Night-jogging?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.477
Yeah. I'm trying to get in shape
for wrestling.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.939
Okay, fine, I was cruising Fox Forest.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.567
I'm going out for wrestling.
I had to tell my dad I was jogging.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.945
-He believed you?
-Yeah. He wants to believe me.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.114
Hey, look, I get it, you're post-Joaquin,
but cruising?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.159
Come on, Kev, you know I hate that.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.038
Why can't you use Grind'em
like every other gay guy?

04:07.121 --> 04:09.290
[Kevin] Nobody's who they say
they are online.

04:09.374 --> 04:12.126
In real life,
what you see is what you get.

04:12.210 --> 04:16.130
[Betty] Moose and Midge were shot
literally 300 yards from Fox Forest,

04:16.214 --> 04:18.675
and the person who did it
is still out there.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.344
Tell me you won't go back
until he's caught.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.722
Okay, fine. I will not go back.
Scout's honor.

04:25.890 --> 04:26.975
[bell rings]

04:30.687 --> 04:34.065
If I wasn't such a big slab of beef,
Midge might've been hit.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.150
You saved her life, bro.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.156
Your nurse is hot. What if you pop
a boner during a sponge bath?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.160
And it wasn't a ski mask?
He was wearing a black hood for sure?

04:48.162 --> 04:50.873
Anything else you remember
about how he looked?

04:52.000 --> 04:52.834
[Moose] His eyes.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.505
They're green, right?

04:58.506 --> 04:59.590
[Midge] They were blank.

05:00.883 --> 05:03.136
Like there wasn't a person
behind them.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.516
He was like Michael Myers.
He had the devil's eyes.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.686
[Midge sighs]

05:14.480 --> 05:17.191
[metal detector beeping]

05:17.275 --> 05:20.028
-It's the pins on my hat.
-Take it off, go again.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.455
Forsythe Pendleton Jones III.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.874
Uh... it's Jughead, actually.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.542
I'm Toni Topaz.

05:35.543 --> 05:38.629
I was supposed to give you
the full animatronic tour,

05:38.713 --> 05:42.050
but some robots went insane
and started killing the guests,

05:42.133 --> 05:43.843
so, we'll just wing it.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.557
Classrooms don't have Wi-Fi,
bathroom stalls don't have doors.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.476
What about the Red and Black?

05:51.559 --> 05:55.229
Yeah, it no longer exists. Censorship?
Budget cuts? Take your pick.

05:55.688 --> 06:00.735
You'll find a glimpse of jingle-jangle
being consumed in its natural habitat.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.029
[Jughead] I'm sorry, "jingle-jangle"?

06:03.112 --> 06:07.742
This place is crawling with the JJ.
A highly addictive total gutter drug.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.869
So, let's not touch that.

06:10.995 --> 06:11.996
Jingle-jangle.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.748
Fascinating.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.627
[Toni] Here in the cafetorium,
Ghoulies sit over there.

06:17.710 --> 06:22.006
Rival gang, drug dealers, street racers,
rumors of cannibalism.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.466
Don't ask.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.844
And we sit over there.
With the Serpents.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.055
You're a Southside Serpent?

06:29.138 --> 06:32.266
Why do you think that I volunteered
to give you the tour?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.394
Actually, I'm gonna sit alone.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.606
Just, you know,
finish my book and brood.

06:39.398 --> 06:42.443
I'm confused.
Aren't you like a Serpent by blood?

06:42.527 --> 06:44.654
The son of FP Jones?

06:44.737 --> 06:45.571
Yeah.

06:46.114 --> 06:50.493
So, I self-identify as a loner,
not a pack animal.

06:50.868 --> 06:54.664
I'm just gonna put my head down
and try and get through this, okay?

06:54.747 --> 06:59.377
Hey, you wanna get through this,
you should hang with the Serpents.

07:00.378 --> 07:03.297
If the Ghoulies get a whiff
that you're alone,

07:03.381 --> 07:07.635
they'll make you their bitch faster
than you can say American History X.

07:11.347 --> 07:15.268
Moose and Midge described him.
Same guy that shot you, same hood, eyes.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.353
Well, maybe and maybe not.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.521
Dad, it's him.

07:19.063 --> 07:23.609
If Sheriff Keller's not gonna take that
seriously, I think we should... be ready.

07:23.693 --> 07:28.072
Like, maybe we should buy a gun,
just be armed in case--

07:28.156 --> 07:29.073
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.952
Easy, okay? Ease up on that.
We're gonna let the cops do their job.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.622
"Armed"?
What the hell are you talking about?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.708
Archie, this is not the Wild West.

07:38.791 --> 07:41.627
We don't keep guns in this house.
Okay?

07:42.086 --> 07:43.087
So, just cool it.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.135
Why don't you sit down next to me,
loverboy?

07:50.386 --> 07:53.806
-Archie?
-I'm sorry. This thing with Moose...

07:54.265 --> 07:57.894
It's like nobody cares. Dad keeps saying,
"Leave it to Sheriff Keller."

07:57.977 --> 08:01.689
I'm like, "Yeah, he did a great job
of catching Jason's murderer."

08:01.772 --> 08:03.608
Oh. Wait, I'm sorry, that was us.

08:03.691 --> 08:05.026
Inside voices, please?

08:05.109 --> 08:06.444
[Jughead] No, don't stop him.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.530
Archie going Travis Bickle
is my favorite Archie yet.

08:09.614 --> 08:13.326
Doesn't it feel like he's targeting us?
I mean, specifically?

08:14.452 --> 08:16.662
I don't want anyone else getting hurt.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.540
When we had a getaway on the Cape,

08:20.082 --> 08:24.170
all of us got together and hired
private security to keep out the riffraff

08:24.253 --> 08:27.089
-as an added layer of protection.
-[Hiram] I loved that house.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.800
-[Veronica] Daddy.
-We're on our way to dinner at the club.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.761
I wanted to meet your friends first.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.596
Great. Thank you.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.266
-This is Betty Cooper.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.101
[Veronica] And Jughead Jones.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.019
-Hi.
-[Hiram] Hey.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.355
-You know my dad.
-[Hiram] I do. He's a good man.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.397
He values family.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.234
I hope his return comes sooner
rather than later.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.569
-Yeah, so do we.
-[Veronica] And, Daddy, this is--

08:48.653 --> 08:51.864
Archie Andrews. The boy
who's captured my daughter's heart.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.117
-Daddy.
-Uh, it's nice to meet you, sir.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.953
Ah, please.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.163
Call me Hiram.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.877
I couldn't help
but overhear your discussion and I, um...

09:05.294 --> 09:07.421
I understand your frustration.

09:07.505 --> 09:11.384
As for someone who's had
his own share of run-ins with the law...

09:11.467 --> 09:12.718
[chuckles]

09:12.802 --> 09:15.888
I can say that the police
aren't always the solution.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.810
Sometimes we need to take matters
into our own hands.

09:20.893 --> 09:24.105
-We need to protect ourselves.
-[Hermione] We're gonna lose our table.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.481
Oh, yes, of course.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.650
Hey, it was nice to meet all of you.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.738
-Oh, and Archie.
-Yes.

09:32.822 --> 09:35.074
[Hiram]
Why don't you come over for dinner?

09:35.616 --> 09:39.287
I look forward to seeing what you
come up with... to save Riverdale.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.268
I wouldn't push that if I were you.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.729
I'm not. Daddy invited Archie.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.690
Mm-hm.
Daddy wants to please his little girl.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.859
And you want your father's approval.

10:52.735 --> 10:53.569
Mija...

10:54.695 --> 10:56.989
you want everything
to change overnight.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.867
You want him to be friends
with your friends.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.454
And that will happen.
Just no need to rush it.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.539
No need to be so thirsty, Veronica.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.344
I'm off to school. Here.

11:18.427 --> 11:21.180
-What's that?
-I don't know. It was on the porch.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.227
Guys, we're under attack.

11:27.645 --> 11:30.523
And by "we,"
I mean our friends, our families.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.692
This time, it was Moose and Midge.

11:34.485 --> 11:38.614
Next time, it could be you...
your girlfriend, your family.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.450
It's time to do something about it.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.412
I want us to start a watch group.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.956
Not to canvass the town,
that's not workable,

11:47.498 --> 11:50.251
but to focus on Riverdale High,
its students,

11:50.334 --> 11:52.545
its faculty and staff, its parents,

11:52.628 --> 11:56.257
where we all hang out,
an extra circle of protection around it.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.552
You want us to take it to the streets,
kick some ass.

12:00.136 --> 12:05.391
That was my first thought, too, Reg.
But no, no weapons, no violence.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.979
I'm talking about a patrol, an extra set
of eyes and ears for the police.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.106
And what if we run into the killer?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.319
Then we call Sheriff Keller.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.156
We're not vigilantes. We're watchdogs.

12:20.656 --> 12:24.618
-We're the Watchdogs.
-We're not called the Watchdogs, Reg.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.163
We're called the Red Circle.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.331
We hold the line.

12:29.957 --> 12:33.502
We're not waiting for the next attack.
We're protecting our own.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.589
-Whoo! Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

12:36.672 --> 12:37.798
[students cheering]

12:40.468 --> 12:42.511
[Phillips] Fahrenheit 451,

12:42.595 --> 12:45.347
by one of my favorite authors,
Ray Bradbury.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.974
Let's start with the title.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.768
Can anyone tell me its significance?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.353
What? Damn it!

12:56.025 --> 12:59.945
People, there's a burning book
on the cover.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.870
Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature
at which paper burns.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.666
"It was a pleasure to burn."

13:13.918 --> 13:15.085
Indeed.

13:15.169 --> 13:20.216
Thank you, Mr... Jones.
And welcome to hell.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.177
[bell rings]

13:29.683 --> 13:30.935
Uh, hi, Mr. Phillips?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.853
[Phillips] Mr. Jones.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.148
Toni was telling me
you used to advise the school paper.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.067
I was wondering what happened.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.530
Drugs and gangs came
to Southside High.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.659
Trying to get students interested
in the school paper

13:46.742 --> 13:48.827
was an exercise in futility.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.788
I'm interested. I have experience.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.624
At Riverdale High,
I wrote for the Blue and Gold.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.834
I'll put in the work.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.296
Your articles online?

13:59.880 --> 14:00.839
Mm-hm.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.883
I'll take a look, let you know.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.260
[Jughead] Thanks.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.975
Hey. What happened last night?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.810
You said you were coming
to Veronica's.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.270
Yeah, something came up.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.023
Something in the woods?

14:18.107 --> 14:20.150
Betty, don't take this the wrong way,

14:20.234 --> 14:24.446
but how many years did I listen to you
go on about Archie and Jughead?

14:24.989 --> 14:27.241
Did you ask my permission
to date them?

14:27.324 --> 14:29.910
No. You didn't need it.
And I don't need yours.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.289
-[Betty] Dating is one thing. This is--
-It's none of your business.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.040
I'll, uh, catch you later.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.792
Kev. [scoffs]

14:40.254 --> 14:44.967
So, button-down Kevin Keller
has a sex-drive. So what?

14:46.010 --> 14:50.598
So, it's putting him in danger.
Why won't he just stop?

14:50.681 --> 14:53.934
Oh, Betty. How little you know
of the human psyche.

14:54.935 --> 14:58.564
Kevin used to be a lonely,
awkward fat boy with acne.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
Now he's a smoke-show.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.735
And?

15:02.818 --> 15:05.863
In his mind,
he's still that unattractive Pugsley.

15:06.363 --> 15:11.410
Kevin wants validation, connection,
even if he has to find it in the woods.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.581
Even with a killer on the loose.
Even if you don't approve.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.213
[Veronica] I have incredible news,
Archiekins.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.592
You are invited to dinner
with my parents, chez moi.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.262
-Oh, Ronnie, this week's crazy--
-I don't care.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.514
Archie, this is nonnegotiable.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.684
That drive-by he did
was a kind gesture,

15:35.768 --> 15:40.564
but this, this is like... I don't wanna
call it a test, though it kind of is.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.400
-What am I being tested for?
-Not you, my father.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.195
Can he just be a dad for one night?

15:46.278 --> 15:50.908
No agenda other than getting to know
someone who's important to me.

15:52.368 --> 15:56.789
-In that case, I'll be there for you.
-I don't have time to teach you Spanish,

15:56.872 --> 16:00.084
but I've selected phrases
for you to memorize and practice.

16:00.167 --> 16:03.921
And can we not talk about that
private army you're starting? Okay?

16:04.546 --> 16:05.589
Thanks.

16:13.973 --> 16:14.807
[Betty] Hey.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.893
-Hey. [sighs]
-[Betty] What's wrong?

16:20.562 --> 16:22.314
Your mother got some fan mail.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.735
He calls himself the Black Hood
and he wants us to publish this letter.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.279
He wants everyone to know

16:29.363 --> 16:32.074
that he shot Fred Andrews
and Moose and Midge...

16:33.033 --> 16:34.827
and murdered Geraldine Grundy.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.870
Are you sure that this is real?

16:37.329 --> 16:38.914
[Alice] Oh, it's real, all right.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.721
[Keller] "This is the Black Hood.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.598
I am the man
who shot the adulterer at Pop's.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.228
I killed the child predator in Greendale.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.774
I shot the drug- and sex-addicted
teenagers at Lovers' Lane.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.943
Riverdale is not innocent.

17:08.027 --> 17:12.031
It's a town of hypocrites,
degenerates, criminals.

17:13.449 --> 17:19.913
My wrath is the price of your lies,
your secrets, your sins.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.418
I will not stop. I cannot be stopped.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.297
I am the wolf. You are the flock.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.551
This is the blood-letting.
You will hear from me again."

17:33.218 --> 17:35.512
Well, Tom, how real is this threat?

17:35.596 --> 17:38.140
Well, it's definitely
Fred Andrews' wallet.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.685
These sunglasses,
I'm checking with Greendale P.D.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.317
Alice, in the spirit of public safety--
Tom, tell me if you disagree.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.653
--it's important
to not give this lunatic an audience.

17:51.737 --> 17:56.075
Mayor McCoy, it is our responsibility
to let the public know he's out there

17:56.158 --> 17:57.659
targeting his next victim.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.996
If you print this,
you're gonna cause panic.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.167
I want a media blackout for 24 hours
on this letter, at least.

18:05.709 --> 18:07.878
And I'll be taking it into Evidence.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.421
I'll send you a copy.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.964
[Alice] Oh, no need, sheriff.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.258
We made one right
before we sent it to the printer

18:13.342 --> 18:15.010
for tomorrow's front page.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.641
Mr. Jones, I read your work.
I'm impressed.

18:20.724 --> 18:24.103
So much so that I'll consider
reopening the Red and the Black

18:24.186 --> 18:25.187
on two conditions:

18:25.270 --> 18:28.065
One, no gangs. Two, no jingle-jangle.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.401
Write about them. If I see you
trafficking in either, we're done.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.445
That will not be a problem for me.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.993
Did you think
I'd let teenagers form a militia?

18:40.702 --> 18:42.663
We're trying to help, sheriff.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.415
-People are scared.
-A lynch mob won't help that.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.460
-Sheriff Keller.
-We have a big problem here, Waldo.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.839
You see, your student
has formed his own private army.

18:53.006 --> 18:54.842
The Red Circle is a school club.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.969
You endorse this?

18:57.052 --> 18:59.346
[Weatherbee] Archie has shown
tremendous initiative.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.766
You can't fault students
for wanting to protect each other.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.395
Morning, Waldo.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.650
[Archie chuckles]

19:15.320 --> 19:16.321
[coughs]

19:18.824 --> 19:20.492
Well, it's no New York Times.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.538
But, hey, kudos
on finding your safe space, snowflake.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.917
Yeah, all I need now is a photographer
with an amazing eye

19:29.001 --> 19:31.336
and a hunger for social justice,

19:31.420 --> 19:32.838
and I think I'll be set.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.549
[door opens]

19:36.633 --> 19:38.635
Topaz. Let's bounce.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.515
Jones, wanna come with?
We're going to the quarry.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.976
Uh, I don't have my beach bod yet.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.397
What? You'll ask for help from the
Serpents, but you won't hang with us?

19:50.939 --> 19:53.108
Don't come crawling to us, hat in hand,

19:53.192 --> 19:57.237
when some Ghoulie decides to earn
his stripes by taking out FP Jones' kid.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.656
Duly noted. Thank you, Sweet Pea.

20:01.283 --> 20:05.412
I appreciate what you and the Serpents
have done for me and my dad. I do.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.874
But I'm done. Okay?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.252
No more favors coming your way.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.839
Hey, hey, he made up his mind, okay?

20:16.506 --> 20:19.927
Take the hint, Sweet Pea.
He's just not that into you.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.887
Let's motor.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.724
Catch you later, Jones.

20:30.479 --> 20:34.441
-I'm going. I'm leaving Riverdale.
-You'll give the babies whiplash.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.860
[Polly] I've called the farm.
They still have room.

20:36.944 --> 20:37.861
Farm? What farm?

20:37.945 --> 20:41.198
The farm Jason and I were running to
before my life fell apart.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.952
Honey, let's just talk about this.
Why are you leaving?

20:45.035 --> 20:47.621
Ask Mom. She's the one baiting a killer.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.916
-A killer targeting sinners.
-Polly, you're not a sinner.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.627
I'm an unwed mother
carrying my cousin's babies.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.587
I am the poster child for sin.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.549
That's it. Over my dead body
are you gonna run off to some farm

20:59.633 --> 21:01.885
and give birth in a trough, no doubt.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.179
It might be over your dead body,
Mother,

21:04.263 --> 21:06.848
but it won't be over mine
or my babies'.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.059
Polly!

21:09.142 --> 21:10.227
I'll talk to her.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.739
Midge wanted to thank you...
for saving my life.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.032
[scoffs]

21:24.116 --> 21:25.826
You're like her new hero now.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.954
[sighs]

21:29.037 --> 21:33.125
Hey, so, what were you doing
out there in the woods, anyways?

21:34.626 --> 21:38.422
[chuckles] What were you doing out there
with Midge? Besides drugs.

21:38.505 --> 21:42.551
That was her idea.
She likes to get a little crazy sometimes.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.348
I like Midge, a lot.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.436
Sometimes I'm not sure
we're that great a match.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.648
Kevin, are you okay?

21:57.566 --> 22:00.319
I haven't been making
great decisions lately.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.822
Lying to my dad, sneaking around
and going into the woods.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.533
I know it's dangerous,
but I can't stop myself.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.119
It's like I don't even care. What is that?

22:09.911 --> 22:12.873
I don't know, but guys like us?

22:13.832 --> 22:14.750
Like you?

22:15.876 --> 22:17.544
In a town like Riverdale?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.881
We don't have a lot of options.

22:21.965 --> 22:27.179
So, even if something bad
could happen, we go for it,

22:27.262 --> 22:30.390
'cause what if for ten minutes...

22:31.308 --> 22:35.270
or maybe even just for two minutes...
we're not alone?

22:36.605 --> 22:39.608
[chuckles] I'm glad you're okay, Moose.
Midge, too.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.195
Kevin.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.655
You don't have to go.

22:45.739 --> 22:48.241
Or you can come back, whenever.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.953
If you wanna hang out... or talk.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.672
You're playing with fire,
I want you to know.

23:03.090 --> 23:04.925
I'm polishing cutlery, Mom.

23:05.425 --> 23:09.262
In advance of my parents getting
to know my boyfriend over dinner.

23:09.346 --> 23:13.183
That may be your agenda,
but it's not necessarily your father's.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.644
He's making an effort,
I'm making an effort.

23:15.727 --> 23:17.938
The only person not making an effort
is you.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.774
-I'm trying to warn you.
-About what, Mom?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.943
What do you think Daddy's gonna do?

23:23.026 --> 23:25.153
Please, God,
enough of these veiled threats.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.948
Tell me you think he's dangerous.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.534
Say it to my face
or forever hold your peace

23:30.617 --> 23:33.411
because we're never having
this conversation again.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.751
Can't do it, can you?

23:43.672 --> 23:47.134
Just remember, you're the one
who welcomed him back.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.802
[scoffs]

23:57.561 --> 23:59.563
[rock music playing on stereo]

24:03.483 --> 24:07.028
-Huh. I thought no weapons.
-I've had this bat since I was 10.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.031
Check out the backseat.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.534
Old-school.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.041
[door opens]

24:22.043 --> 24:23.044
Oh...

24:23.128 --> 24:25.380
-[Jughead] Betty.
-So, this is the Red and Black.

24:25.463 --> 24:28.508
You cannot be here at night
unless you are armed.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.678
Well, I am.

24:32.804 --> 24:33.722
[chuckles]

24:34.514 --> 24:39.311
Okay, honestly? I hit pay dirt. Do you
remember how no one could explain

24:39.394 --> 24:42.189
the local component
of Clifford Blossom's drug pipeline?

24:42.272 --> 24:46.985
That jingle-jangle, the stuff Moose
and Midge were on? It's coming from here.

24:47.068 --> 24:51.781
My dad said that Serpents never deal
in hard drugs, but the Ghoulies do.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.075
Well, is it wise to be writing

24:54.159 --> 24:58.205
about gangs and drugs
while you're going to school here?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.456
You worried about me?

25:01.082 --> 25:02.876
Well, yeah, Jug.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.172
I thought you liked me reckless.

25:14.554 --> 25:15.680
[door creaks]

25:16.223 --> 25:19.559
Oh, sorry, guys.
I didn't see the sock on the door.

25:19.643 --> 25:21.269
It's okay. Heh.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.314
Hey, Toni. Ah...

25:24.773 --> 25:27.692
Betty, this is Toni. She is
the photographer for the newspaper.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.610
Oh.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.405
-This is Betty. This is my girlfriend.
-[Betty] Hi, Toni.

25:32.489 --> 25:37.410
-Huh. You are not at all what I pictured.
-Really? What did you picture?

25:37.494 --> 25:39.162
[Toni] Uh, Emily the Strange.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.039
Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.919
Hey, look what Betty got us.

25:48.546 --> 25:49.839
Great minds.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.592
Great minds.
