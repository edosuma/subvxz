WEBVTT

00:05.248 --> 00:07.433
SIMON: <i>Hola,</i> Lauren.

00:07.435 --> 00:09.101
<i>¿Como está usted?</i>

00:09.103 --> 00:10.185
I don't speak Spanish, Simon.

00:10.187 --> 00:11.353
Really? I thought
you were Puerto Rican.

00:11.355 --> 00:12.587
I thought she was Moroccan.

00:12.589 --> 00:13.772
I had you for Portuguese.

00:13.774 --> 00:14.973
I thought you were Lebanese.

00:14.975 --> 00:16.358
- I'm from Long Island.
- Oh.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.476
You're our diversity hire.

00:17.478 --> 00:18.694
If anyone asks,
tell them you're "other."

00:18.696 --> 00:19.862
Now, can you call
security and get

00:19.864 --> 00:21.730
a parking pass
for this new intern?

00:21.732 --> 00:23.532
- She starts tomorrow.
- You got it.

00:23.534 --> 00:25.034
I love when we have interns.

00:25.036 --> 00:26.935
Finally, someone else can get
everyone's stupid coffees.

00:26.937 --> 00:28.454
Oh, and when
you're done with that,

00:28.456 --> 00:30.289
can you get me a macchiato
from that place downstairs?

00:30.291 --> 00:31.740
Of course. Happy to do it.

00:31.742 --> 00:33.125
We're getting a new intern?

00:33.127 --> 00:34.460
Are you sure this
is a good idea

00:34.462 --> 00:35.828
after the whole sexual
harassment thing

00:35.830 --> 00:37.212
last time, with Zach?

00:37.214 --> 00:39.631
It's pretty unnerving, but I
eventually dropped the charges.

00:39.633 --> 00:40.799
She wasn't completely wrong.

00:40.801 --> 00:42.217
You were kind of asking for it
wearing those pants.

00:42.219 --> 00:43.618
"Kelsi Lasker."

00:43.620 --> 00:46.672
I wonder how she got
the job. Oh, wait.

00:46.674 --> 00:49.391
Isn't Lasker Lunch Meats
one of our biggest clients?

00:49.393 --> 00:52.010
Just because someone is the
daughter of an important person

00:52.012 --> 00:53.512
does not mean
that they are not worthy.

00:53.514 --> 00:55.230
- Mm. - She gets that
confidence from me.

00:55.232 --> 00:57.433
Look, she's got a 3.9 GPA.

00:57.435 --> 00:58.600
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, from the...

00:58.602 --> 01:00.185
"Lasker School of Business."

01:00.187 --> 01:01.303
Very impressive.

01:01.305 --> 01:03.472
She graduated
Phi Beta Cold Cut.

01:03.474 --> 01:05.324
Fine. Make all the jokes
that you want,

01:05.325 --> 01:07.192
but wealth and power do not
automatically equal success.

01:07.194 --> 01:08.660
- Mm.
- Okay, sure she comes

01:08.662 --> 01:10.812
from an influential family,
but because of that,

01:10.814 --> 01:13.248
she has faced doubters like
you two every step of the way.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.834
Is she championing the cause
of the over-privileged?

01:15.836 --> 01:18.754
Well, that's a stance a lot of
people are afraid to take.

01:18.756 --> 01:20.089
You guys have no idea
what it's like.

01:20.091 --> 01:21.790
People writing off your
accomplishments as luck.

01:21.792 --> 01:24.760
- Uh-huh. - Lack of obstacles,
making it almost impossible

01:24.762 --> 01:26.044
- to prove yourself.
- Oh. So hard.

01:26.046 --> 01:27.012
Fine. I'm done standing here

01:27.014 --> 01:28.046
while you besmirch
her character.

01:28.048 --> 01:29.664
Last name "Lasker""

01:29.666 --> 01:31.183
She has a red Mercedes,
Model S550.

01:31.185 --> 01:33.102
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:33.104 --> 01:34.503
You know, a lot
of people drive Mercedes.

01:34.505 --> 01:36.355
Happens to be one of
the safest cars on the road.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.474
License plate
reads "Princess."

01:38.476 --> 01:40.342
The last "S" is a money sign.

01:40.344 --> 01:41.560
- Mm-hmm!
- Mm-hmm!

01:41.562 --> 01:44.113
Maybe regular "princess"
was taken.

01:44.115 --> 01:46.732
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

01:46.734 --> 01:49.618

02:00.965 --> 02:03.165
(elevator bell dings)

02:03.167 --> 02:05.134
- I got it.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

02:05.136 --> 02:06.468
Maybe we shouldn't
go up at the same time.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.137
- Oh, come on. - Well,
people might know

02:08.139 --> 02:09.304
we were together last night.

02:09.306 --> 02:10.722
Ugh, we can't keep doing this.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.174
Why do we keep doing this?

02:12.176 --> 02:13.542
Look, it's not our fault.

02:13.544 --> 02:15.894
We're both you, hot,
great-smelling.

02:15.896 --> 02:17.396
They throw us up there

02:17.398 --> 02:18.897
in that terrarium
they call a workplace,

02:18.899 --> 02:20.715
what do they think
is going to happen?

02:20.717 --> 02:22.017
I know. Right?

02:22.019 --> 02:24.219
We're like those pandas
at the National Zoo.

02:24.221 --> 02:25.687
Yeah... young, hot pandas.

02:25.689 --> 02:27.556
I-I can't.

02:27.558 --> 02:29.741
I-I just think I
need something more.

02:29.743 --> 02:32.361
Yeah. More.

02:32.363 --> 02:34.329
- Yeah.
- I totally...

02:34.331 --> 02:36.165
Not from you.
From a human capable of it.

02:36.167 --> 02:38.200
Thank God. Oh, my God, you had
me scared there for a second.

02:38.202 --> 02:40.902
(elevator bell dings)

02:40.904 --> 02:44.890
Well, Zach, it was great running
into you in the elevator.

02:44.892 --> 02:46.091
I guess we'll see each other
around the office,

02:46.093 --> 02:48.243
because that's totally normal.

02:48.245 --> 02:51.079
So, how long have you guys been
sleeping together this time?

02:51.081 --> 02:52.214
- Couple weeks.
- Mm.

02:52.216 --> 02:54.099
I asked her for a
hand with this job,

02:54.101 --> 02:55.801
she misunderstood, and
I just went with it.

02:55.803 --> 02:57.052
Well, as your boss,

02:57.054 --> 02:58.420
I have to caution you
against office romances.

02:58.422 --> 03:00.055
They can be sticky,
so tread carefully.

03:00.057 --> 03:01.857
But as a follower
of your Tumblr, I say,

03:01.859 --> 03:03.192
change the names and go for it.

03:03.194 --> 03:04.643
So, how's the new intern?

03:04.645 --> 03:06.595
Great. She's gonna be
great when she gets here.

03:06.597 --> 03:08.146
(elevator bell dings)
She's a little late.

03:08.148 --> 03:09.781
Sorry, sorry.

03:09.783 --> 03:11.533
Total roommate drama.

03:11.535 --> 03:14.119
- Uh, Kelsi, I'm Sydney. We spoke
on the phone. - Oh, thanks.

03:14.121 --> 03:16.788
Anyway, I just moved in
with my friend Brooke.

03:16.790 --> 03:17.956
Kind of regretting it.

03:17.958 --> 03:19.441
She's such an Aries.

03:19.443 --> 03:21.076
Ugh. The... worst.

03:21.078 --> 03:22.628
Yeah. We're dealing
with this whole

03:22.630 --> 03:24.463
who-gets-the-bigger-room
situation.

03:24.465 --> 03:26.415
She's being
so emo bratty about it.

03:26.417 --> 03:27.633
Check out the text she sent me.

03:27.635 --> 03:29.218
"IDK"?

03:29.220 --> 03:31.837
It means "I don't know."
Just give it to me.

03:31.839 --> 03:32.954
"IDK what your deal is.

03:32.956 --> 03:34.172
I can only assume."

03:34.174 --> 03:35.924
That does feel attacking. Right?

03:35.926 --> 03:37.726
"I can't even bring
up the room situation

03:37.728 --> 03:39.177
without you literally
jumping down my throat."

03:39.179 --> 03:40.896
Not the correct
use of "literally""

03:40.898 --> 03:43.348
Yeah, because she literally
has rocks for brains.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.433
Uh, no, she doesn't.

03:44.435 --> 03:45.684
- Simon?
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.686 --> 03:46.968
The meeting

03:46.970 --> 03:48.570
with the non-alcoholic
wine people is in five minutes.

03:48.572 --> 03:51.073
So, what do you guys think
I should do?

03:51.075 --> 03:52.908
I think we should table
this discussion till later.

03:52.910 --> 03:53.909
Why are you yelling at me?

03:53.911 --> 03:55.310
He's not yelling at you.

03:55.312 --> 03:56.862
He's just saying things are
a little hectic right now.

03:56.864 --> 03:58.697
Oh, my God,
you don't have to attack me.

03:58.699 --> 04:00.666
I'm sorry.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.036
So, how long is
this internship for?

04:04.038 --> 04:05.704
- Three months.
- And Lasker is...?

04:05.706 --> 04:06.955
A $30 million account.

04:06.957 --> 04:08.156
Right. Good.

04:08.158 --> 04:09.791
In advertising,
there's a classic theory

04:09.793 --> 04:10.959
called "The Habit Loop."

04:10.961 --> 04:12.127
SYDNEY:
Everyone has some habit

04:12.129 --> 04:13.178
that they're trying to break.

04:13.180 --> 04:14.179
The trick is to replace

04:14.181 --> 04:15.264
the bad habit with one

04:15.266 --> 04:16.714
that's a little less dangerous.

04:16.716 --> 04:19.051
(sneezes)
Sorry. Allergies.

04:19.053 --> 04:21.970
SYDNEY: Anyway, in the
case of your product,

04:21.971 --> 04:24.189
non-alcoholic wine,
it's an extremely easy sell.

04:24.191 --> 04:26.858
I mean, you're literally giving
people a healthy alternative

04:26.860 --> 04:28.277
to a habit they already have.

04:28.279 --> 04:29.561
(sneezes)

04:29.563 --> 04:31.530
Oh, this damn pollen.

04:31.532 --> 04:32.681
(chuckles)

04:32.683 --> 04:33.865
SIMON:
Like in the '80s,

04:33.867 --> 04:35.867
when I replaced coke
with the new coke,

04:35.869 --> 04:37.619
which was just my nickname
for speed, really.

04:37.621 --> 04:39.037
Eventually I went back
to classic coke,

04:39.039 --> 04:40.822
and I liked it
better than ever.

04:40.824 --> 04:43.325
I just tried your Sober-Syrah,
and I have to say,

04:43.327 --> 04:45.627
this is so good,
I'm gonna skip the A.A. meeting

04:45.629 --> 04:47.462
and go straight
to coffee and a cigarette.

04:47.464 --> 04:49.364
ANDREW: Normally,
I have to pour my wine into

04:49.366 --> 04:51.500
a coffee mug at work,
but not with your Merlot-To-Go.

04:51.502 --> 04:52.968
It's actually just grape juice.

04:52.970 --> 04:54.503
Gonna want to downplay that.

04:54.505 --> 04:56.305
Excuse me...
Cindy, you have a call

04:56.307 --> 04:58.006
on that plugged-in phone thingy.

04:58.008 --> 05:00.425
Ooh! You guys day-drinking?

05:00.427 --> 05:02.594
Oh, it's the fake stuff.
Never mind.

05:02.596 --> 05:04.846
Kelsi, thank you so much.
Why don't you take a message

05:04.848 --> 05:06.315
and tell them
I'll call them back.

05:06.317 --> 05:07.599
See, this is the problem.

05:07.601 --> 05:09.551
People just don't see
the product as cool.

05:09.553 --> 05:11.553
How could we make this hip
for your generation?

05:11.555 --> 05:13.322
Do you guys really want
to know what I think?

05:13.324 --> 05:14.556
Kelsi is just the intern.

05:14.558 --> 05:16.525
Yeah, but they did
ask her opinion,

05:16.527 --> 05:18.360
and she's the
target demo, and...

05:18.362 --> 05:19.995
I mean, come on... people
used to dismiss me like this.

05:19.997 --> 05:21.079
Let's give her a chance.

05:21.081 --> 05:24.566
Okay. Gentlemen, Kelsi.

05:24.568 --> 05:26.118
"IDK what your deal is.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.286
I can only assume ""
Total bitch, right?

05:28.288 --> 05:30.255
I'm sorry.
What's happening here?

05:30.257 --> 05:31.206
KELSI:
I found the apartment.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.841
I should get the bigger room.

05:32.843 --> 05:34.009
SMH.

05:34.011 --> 05:35.410
(sighs) SMH?

05:35.412 --> 05:37.295
- Shaking my head. - Like
your dad is doing.

05:37.297 --> 05:38.880
This phone smells
like marijuana.

05:38.882 --> 05:40.382
NBD.

05:42.000 --> 05:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:51.144 --> 05:54.196
You haven't come over
the last three nights.

05:54.198 --> 05:56.865
Message received.
You want more.

05:56.867 --> 05:58.784
So, here's what I'm proposing.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.569
A weekend away.

06:00.571 --> 06:01.903
Just the two of us.

06:01.905 --> 06:04.406
You can invite that half-Asian
friend, if you want.

06:04.408 --> 06:07.626
As generous as that offer is,
I told you, Zach,

06:07.628 --> 06:09.194
you and I are done hooking up.

06:09.196 --> 06:11.630
You're a bad habit,
and I need to stop.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.583
Okay... if that's
how you feel.

06:14.585 --> 06:15.751
(sniffles)

06:15.753 --> 06:17.135
Uh, if my name

06:17.137 --> 06:19.054
comes up in the ladies'
room, say good things.

06:19.056 --> 06:21.506
You know, talk about
how I am with my nephew.

06:23.459 --> 06:24.726
That was impressive.

06:24.728 --> 06:25.977
Where'd you get
that willpower from?

06:25.979 --> 06:27.396
It's that habit loop thing.

06:27.398 --> 06:30.482
I just replaced my Zach habit
with something less bad for me.

06:30.484 --> 06:33.301
- Like what? - I've been getting
together with Andrew.

06:33.303 --> 06:34.653
Oh, not like that.

06:34.655 --> 06:37.439
After work, we go,
we have coffee, we talk.

06:37.441 --> 06:39.608
I think that more
than the sex with Zach,

06:39.610 --> 06:42.277
I was just looking for a fun guy
to hang out with.

06:42.279 --> 06:44.145
So you've been asking Andrew out
for coffee?

06:44.147 --> 06:46.364
- Yeah. It's just friends.
- Does he know that?

06:46.366 --> 06:47.982
I mean, he just
broke up with Nancy.

06:47.984 --> 06:49.418
He's kind of
vulnerable right now.

06:49.420 --> 06:51.953
I mean, he wore his sad pants
four days in a row last week.

06:51.955 --> 06:54.122
Come on. It's Andrew. Of course
he knows it's just friends.

06:54.124 --> 06:55.290
He's like my brother.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.325
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, Lauren.

06:58.795 --> 07:00.512
Toast. Toast. Toast.

07:00.514 --> 07:02.764
Off to make the toast.

07:02.766 --> 07:04.966
(laughs)

07:06.018 --> 07:09.638
Yeah, that's gonna
be a problem.

07:11.607 --> 07:14.693
So, Kelsi, you've been with us,
you know, for a week now,

07:14.695 --> 07:16.061
and we wanted
to have a little chat,

07:16.063 --> 07:17.279
you know,
give you a little feedback.

07:17.281 --> 07:19.180
Look, I know
I've messed up a few things.

07:19.182 --> 07:20.515
Messed up? No, no.

07:20.517 --> 07:21.950
Growing pains,
the learning curve.

07:21.952 --> 07:24.369
- Are you enjoying your time here?
- Mm...

07:24.371 --> 07:26.655
Did you tell your dad
you're enjoying your time here?

07:26.657 --> 07:28.373
What we're saying is,
there's, you know,

07:28.375 --> 07:31.359
maybe a few small places where
you could improve a little.

07:31.361 --> 07:32.377
Mm.

07:32.379 --> 07:34.045
Like maybe
a little less texting.

07:34.047 --> 07:35.497
SIMON:
And the time you went to Cancun

07:35.499 --> 07:36.748
for two days and
didn't tell anyone...

07:36.750 --> 07:37.799
you know, just check in.

07:37.801 --> 07:39.317
Can everyone stop
yelling at me right now?

07:39.319 --> 07:40.752
This is a normal tone of voice.

07:40.754 --> 07:43.355
She's just shrill.
She gets that from her mother.

07:43.357 --> 07:44.589
You know, I am dealing with

07:44.591 --> 07:46.207
a really stressful
roommate situation.

07:46.209 --> 07:49.210
Okay, and, besides,
let's be honest.

07:49.212 --> 07:51.045
Does it even matter how
I do at this internship?

07:51.047 --> 07:52.898
What do you mean?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.150
I mean, I'm set no matter what.

07:55.152 --> 07:56.251
You know what I'm saying.

07:56.253 --> 07:58.219
Probably more than anyone.

07:58.221 --> 08:01.072
I'm not quite sure
I'm catching your drift.

08:01.074 --> 08:02.324
Easy.

08:02.326 --> 08:04.075
No matter what I do,
I'm gonna be fine.

08:04.077 --> 08:05.277
My daddy will just
give me a job,

08:05.279 --> 08:06.695
just like yours did for you.

08:06.697 --> 08:08.914
My dad... did...

08:08.916 --> 08:11.116
He did not just
give me this job.

08:11.118 --> 08:13.168
(laughs) Keep telling
yourself that, Cindy.

08:13.170 --> 08:15.570
Listen to me,
you little twerking moron.

08:15.572 --> 08:18.239
Okay, I wanted to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

08:18.241 --> 08:19.741
but you and I are nothing alike!

08:19.743 --> 08:23.044
Okay, I earned this job,
and you don't even try!

08:23.046 --> 08:25.714
Or at least, I pray to God
that you aren't trying,

08:25.716 --> 08:28.099
because if this is you trying,
then that is really pathetic!

08:28.101 --> 08:29.518
No, see, <i>that</i> was yelling.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.085
(Kelsi scoffs)

08:31.087 --> 08:32.604
Uh-oh.

08:32.606 --> 08:34.255
Kelsi...

08:34.256 --> 08:35.440
Kelsi, wait.

08:35.442 --> 08:36.942
I never should have
lost my temper.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.927
Uh, we could use more emoticons
on inner-office memos,

08:38.929 --> 08:40.028
just like you suggested!

08:40.030 --> 08:41.813
Oh, go to hell! Send
my love to your dad!

08:41.815 --> 08:43.431
Tell that kook
I'll see him on the links.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.033
(laughs)

08:45.035 --> 08:47.369
Oh, $30 million
just flipped us off.

08:51.594 --> 08:53.202
- Okay, so here's the good news.
- Uh-huh.

08:53.222 --> 08:54.428
If Kelsi
had already

08:54.438 --> 08:56.071
told her dad that I yelled at
her, then he would have already

08:56.073 --> 08:58.374
- called and fired us. - Right, so the
imminent firing is the good news.

08:58.376 --> 08:59.675
- Got it. - So, we have
to talk to her

08:59.677 --> 09:00.976
before she talks to him.

09:00.978 --> 09:02.411
Yeah, but she's not answering
her phone or her texts.

09:02.413 --> 09:03.579
I mean, she could be anywhere.

09:03.581 --> 09:04.947
There's no way
we could possibly find her.

09:04.949 --> 09:06.281
- Found her.
- What?

09:06.283 --> 09:07.416
Yeah, she just instagrammed

09:07.418 --> 09:08.667
from a frat party
at Northwestern.

09:08.669 --> 09:10.536
She instagrams a lot.

09:10.538 --> 09:13.088
- Aw, here's her cat wearing
a tuxedo shirt. - SIMON: Aw.

09:13.090 --> 09:14.506
(purring) (laughing)

09:14.508 --> 09:16.208
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:16.210 --> 09:18.344
Yes, I'll grab my car, you grab
some Mace and a cup with a lid.

09:18.346 --> 09:20.512
We've got a fraternity
party to get to.

09:20.514 --> 09:22.014
It's at ODP, the Jewish frat.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.599
Andrew, come along.
We may need you.

09:23.601 --> 09:24.550
I'm not Jewish.

09:24.552 --> 09:25.884
Really?

09:25.886 --> 09:28.053
I don't have time
to rethink you. Let's go.

09:33.426 --> 09:34.777
Missed.

09:34.779 --> 09:36.762
No sign of Kelsi,
but I did get invited

09:36.764 --> 09:38.147
to a formal,
which is kind of flattering.

09:38.149 --> 09:39.565
You're gonna go to a formal?

09:39.567 --> 09:41.734
Of course not.
These kids are, like, babies.

09:41.736 --> 09:43.202
Besides, I was a Tri-Delt.

09:43.204 --> 09:45.103
We don't date below AEPi.

09:45.105 --> 09:46.872
Say, uh, how long do you
think this is gonna take?

09:46.874 --> 09:48.574
'Cause I'm supposed to
meet Lauren for coffee.

09:48.576 --> 09:50.909
- About that...
- Okay.

09:50.911 --> 09:52.378
Here it comes. The talk.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.613
Look, I know you
and I had a moment,

09:54.615 --> 09:57.282
but this thing with Lauren...
it's completely blindsided me,

09:57.284 --> 09:59.668
but it seems to be moving
forward kind of fast.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.453
So, if you want to
stop this rocket ship,

10:01.455 --> 10:04.556
just speak up now before
it leaves the station

10:04.558 --> 10:07.509
that rocket ships...
that they take off from.

10:07.511 --> 10:08.677
Launch pad?

10:08.679 --> 10:09.845
Yeah. Just let it go.

10:09.847 --> 10:11.013
Hey... who's Molly?

10:11.015 --> 10:13.098
Someone asked if I
wanted to try her.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.483
She sounds kind of interesting.

10:14.485 --> 10:15.768
Oh, what are we even
doing here?

10:15.770 --> 10:17.486
I never should have
let her get to me.

10:17.488 --> 10:19.021
- I really screwed this up.
- No, you didn't.

10:19.023 --> 10:21.407
Listen, the truth is,
I was about to snap at that

10:21.409 --> 10:22.574
little snot myself.

10:22.576 --> 10:24.193
It's not just Kelsi.
It's me.

10:24.195 --> 10:26.311
I wonder if that's
how people see me.

10:26.313 --> 10:28.163
You know, a self-entitled,
very pretty brat.

10:28.165 --> 10:30.249
Oh, not at all.
You're none of those things.

10:30.251 --> 10:32.084
SIMON: Sweetheart, you're
nothing like Kelsi.

10:32.086 --> 10:35.087
You earned this job. You have to say that.
You're my dad.

10:35.089 --> 10:37.039
Hey, guys, uh, not to be a jerk,

10:37.041 --> 10:38.874
but this is
a closed party, so...

10:38.876 --> 10:41.493
They're with me.

10:41.495 --> 10:42.711
Oh.

10:42.713 --> 10:44.663
Oh, sorry. I-I didn't know.

10:44.665 --> 10:46.348
Uh, <i>Shabbatshalom,</i> brother.

10:46.350 --> 10:48.166
Back at you.

10:48.168 --> 10:50.536
You know, Zach's actually
the one that's Jewish.

10:50.538 --> 10:51.720
I could have been
here with Zach?

10:51.722 --> 10:53.672
Wait... Kelsi.

10:53.674 --> 10:55.140
- Oh, my God.
- Just hear us out, okay?

10:55.142 --> 10:57.509
I shouldn't have yelled at you.
We can make this right.

10:57.511 --> 10:59.361
Look, I came here
to play beer pong,

10:59.363 --> 11:00.846
not talk to a bunch of Gandalfs.

11:00.848 --> 11:02.698
- Fine. I got next!
- What?

11:02.700 --> 11:04.700
- Listen, we just need a little face time.
- But you can't drink.

11:04.702 --> 11:06.184
- You're sober.
- Then one of you will play.

11:06.186 --> 11:08.120
- I'm not good at this game. - I
got the gluten thing. - No beer.

11:08.122 --> 11:09.571
Right. I'll play, you drink.

11:09.573 --> 11:10.739
- SYDNEY: What? 
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.608
Okay. How do we do this?

11:12.610 --> 11:14.543
So I just... (pops lips)
in there and then...

11:14.545 --> 11:16.111
Yep. Go right ahead.

11:16.113 --> 11:17.663
Yeah. Alright. Go right ahead.

11:17.665 --> 11:20.198
- I'm not that thirsty.
- Okay. Let's just try this thing.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.717
Maybe it was just the stress
of the day, you know,

11:21.719 --> 11:23.519
but either way, it was
unprofessional of me

11:23.521 --> 11:24.970
to yell at you, and I'm sorry.

11:24.972 --> 11:26.204
I really hope we can...

11:26.206 --> 11:28.507
- Yes! - Oh. Oh, you're
killing me here.

11:28.509 --> 11:31.810
Drink. I got it, baby,
I got it. Don't worry.

11:32.562 --> 11:34.096
(groans) Oh...

11:34.681 --> 11:36.348
Yes!

11:37.717 --> 11:39.101
Oh, what?

11:39.853 --> 11:42.488
- Oh!
- Damn it!

11:43.389 --> 11:44.406
People say they don't have time,

11:44.408 --> 11:46.375
but people make time.

11:46.377 --> 11:48.026
- Oh...
- Oh, you're killing me.

11:48.028 --> 11:49.111
ANDREW: L'chaim. You're getting

11:49.113 --> 11:50.729
beaten by a little girl.

11:50.731 --> 11:53.582
- Aw, how sad for you. Oh...
- Oh!

11:53.584 --> 11:55.400
Yeah, bitch!
(groans)

11:55.402 --> 11:57.536
Take that! Yeah!
(whooping)

11:57.538 --> 11:58.654
You got one!

11:58.656 --> 11:59.571
Yeah, more than that. Mm-mm.

11:59.573 --> 12:01.123
- One.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.991
Let's see. Let's see
how many cups you have here.

12:02.993 --> 12:05.544
You've been owned. There's one. Drink!
You got to drink! Drink! Okay.

12:05.546 --> 12:07.429
Drink it.
Drink it.

12:07.431 --> 12:09.214
Chug, chug, chug, chug.
Vina, vina, vina, vina.

12:09.216 --> 12:11.049
Boom. That was
for you, baby.

12:11.051 --> 12:12.801
That was for you.

12:14.671 --> 12:15.604
(groans)

12:16.940 --> 12:19.191
I mean, junior high
was just so hard for me.

12:19.193 --> 12:21.026
Honey, blow on that
for good luck, okay?

12:21.028 --> 12:22.644
Here we go. Here we go.

12:22.646 --> 12:23.395
(groans)

12:23.397 --> 12:24.930
Are you even trying?

12:24.932 --> 12:26.598
(gibbering, spluttering)

12:26.600 --> 12:28.867
Oh, baby. Hey, baby.
(whoops)

12:29.702 --> 12:31.870
Oh, darn it!
(whoops)

12:31.872 --> 12:33.121
That's game!

12:33.123 --> 12:35.374
- Whoa!
- Aw...

12:35.376 --> 12:37.793
Look at those sad faces.

12:38.661 --> 12:39.962
(camera clicks)

12:39.964 --> 12:42.548
You just got 'grammed, bitches.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.967
I'm gonna show this to my dad when
I tell him what you did to me.

12:44.969 --> 12:46.802
No, no, no, wait. Before you
'gram your dad, listen,

12:46.804 --> 12:49.004
I know we don't pay interns,
but maybe some sort of bonus

12:49.006 --> 12:50.172
will be appropriate, huh?

12:50.174 --> 12:51.456
Like I need the money.

12:51.458 --> 12:52.424
That's ridic.

12:52.426 --> 12:53.759
Money means nothing to her.

12:53.761 --> 12:56.294
I mean, she's got that
mad lunch meat money, yo.

12:56.296 --> 12:57.963
Someone get Syd
a water, please.

12:57.965 --> 12:59.932
Listen, what can
we possibly give you

12:59.934 --> 13:00.983
that you don't already have?

13:00.985 --> 13:02.401
The courage to finish a word?
Mm-hmm.

13:02.403 --> 13:03.969
Whatev. I can't deal
with you guys right now.

13:03.971 --> 13:05.020
I have you yelling at me

13:05.022 --> 13:06.822
and my roommate blowing me up
in all caps.

13:06.824 --> 13:08.607
Roommate! That's what we can...
we can give you.

13:08.609 --> 13:11.109
We can get her roommate
to take the smaller room.

13:11.111 --> 13:12.277
How?
It's easy.

13:12.279 --> 13:14.463
We're in advertising.
I mean...

13:14.465 --> 13:16.748
we sell people stuff
they don't want every day.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.534
All right. Deal.

13:19.536 --> 13:21.587
You did it, baby.
You're a genius.

13:21.589 --> 13:23.705
Oh, God...
(retching)

13:23.707 --> 13:26.341
MAN: Oy, vey! That genius just
huzzed on the house treasurer.

13:26.343 --> 13:28.176
Whoo! Sorry, Avi!

13:30.042 --> 13:32.544
Okay, people, toss 'em out.
There are no bad ideas.

13:32.546 --> 13:35.847
If we put really small furniture
in the room, it'll look bigger.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.948
- No.
- What about coziness?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.750
Okay, what if we open

13:38.752 --> 13:41.002
on this log cabin in Illinois?

13:41.004 --> 13:43.438
Snow falling,
reveal a young Abe Lincoln.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.939
He's shivering in the big room.

13:44.941 --> 13:47.192
There's a light in the
small room. He goes in there.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.476
There's Walker
already asleep in the bed.

13:48.478 --> 13:51.229
He huddles around Walker,
holds him tight,

13:51.231 --> 13:55.650
a sweet spoon, out of which
is born, you know, civil rights.

13:55.652 --> 13:58.153
Okay, maybe the first bad idea
was me saying "no bad ideas""

13:58.155 --> 13:59.287
That's on me.

13:59.289 --> 14:01.322
Well, I thought it was
a good idea, Andrew.

14:01.324 --> 14:03.575
(chuckles) Stop.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.996
Lauren, can I speak with you
for a minute?

14:07.998 --> 14:09.714
You have to stop having coffee
with Andrew.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.948
I mean, look at him.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.801
He's Molly Ringwald
in <i>Sixteen Candles</i> over there.

14:12.803 --> 14:15.053
(sighs) Look, I know you think

14:15.055 --> 14:17.121
that this is somehow helping you
get over your habit

14:17.123 --> 14:18.173
of hooking up with Zach,

14:18.175 --> 14:19.257
- but...
- Yeah...

14:19.259 --> 14:20.425
What?

14:20.427 --> 14:22.010
It isn't completely working.

14:22.012 --> 14:23.228
What do you mean?

14:23.230 --> 14:24.345
Well, it started out working.

14:24.347 --> 14:26.064
The Andrew coffees
filled a void.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.149
But, you know, there's a reason

14:28.151 --> 14:30.819
people sometimes want dessert
after coffee.

14:30.821 --> 14:34.639
♪ Well... ♪

Coming up.

14:55.011 --> 14:57.995
It's like, together,
they equal one perfect guy.

14:57.997 --> 14:59.380
The conversation with Andrew.

14:59.382 --> 15:01.099
All the dirty stuff with Zach.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.101
Zach and Andrew.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.855
Zandrew... that's who
I've been looking for.

15:06.857 --> 15:08.139
Zandrew?

15:08.141 --> 15:09.607
Andrach? I don't know.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.726
You know this needs to stop
before they find out.

15:11.728 --> 15:13.111
I know. You're right.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.397
It's just... Zandrew's so great.

15:16.399 --> 15:18.149
Do they have to find out?

15:20.152 --> 15:21.569
(knocking)

15:22.822 --> 15:23.955
Zach.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.323
Hello.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.574
Zandrew.

15:26.576 --> 15:28.159
What are you guys doing here?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.578
How long do you think
this was gonna go on?

15:30.580 --> 15:31.713
- Hmm?
- Um...

15:31.715 --> 15:33.748
You didn't think
we were gonna talk?

15:33.750 --> 15:36.167
I mean, that's what I'm good at,
isn't it? Talking?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.802
Yeah, we're, like,
best friends.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.053
- Really? - Thank you.
- Yeah.

15:39.055 --> 15:40.889
You're always saying
how shallow I am,

15:40.891 --> 15:43.091
but I would never sleep with
two friends at the same office.

15:43.093 --> 15:44.092
I'm not sleeping with him.

15:44.094 --> 15:45.510
- What?
- Yeah, I made that clear.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.262
You said you've been
hanging out, like, every day.

15:47.264 --> 15:48.930
- Yeah. - But you're
hooking up, right?

15:48.932 --> 15:50.265
- No.
- Kissing?

15:50.267 --> 15:51.733
- No. No. - Listen,
- Boob stuff? Nothing?

15:51.735 --> 15:53.268
I explained this to you.
It's more of an emotional thing

15:53.270 --> 15:54.652
- between the two of us.
- Dude, what are you doing?

15:54.654 --> 15:55.770
Guys, look, I'm so sorry.

15:55.772 --> 15:57.388
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.907
Yeah, well, we're
breaking up with you.

15:58.909 --> 16:00.825
Yeah. Good luck
finding this again.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.527
That is totally fair.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.529
Can we just all go back
to being friends again?

16:04.531 --> 16:05.864
I don't know.

16:05.866 --> 16:07.749
I'm gonna need some
time to get over this.

16:07.751 --> 16:09.534
Yeah. Me, too.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.119
- Dude.
- What? Coffee counts.

16:11.121 --> 16:13.121
I was engaged, I was pulled in.

16:13.123 --> 16:14.339
Oh, my God.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.073
I'm gonna take back
that best friend stuff.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.593
Oh, great. So I'm gonna lose you
and her in the same day?

16:18.595 --> 16:20.044
You are literally
driving me crazy.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.963
Literally? That is not the
correct use of "literally""

16:21.965 --> 16:23.264
Are you an English professor?

16:24.266 --> 16:26.217
SIMON:
<i>Brooke,</i>

16:26.219 --> 16:28.085
thank you for this opportunity
to tell you exactly

16:28.087 --> 16:31.072
why the small room
is the place to be.

16:31.074 --> 16:33.408
- Sydney?
- Wait, me?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.393
- Mm-hmm.
- But this is really hard.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.811
Why, pumpkin?

16:36.813 --> 16:38.596
Smaller is better?

16:38.598 --> 16:42.099
I mean, come on, everyone knows
it's "bigger is better," right?

16:42.101 --> 16:43.434
- What's happening?
- Wait for it.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.786
ZACH:
I agree.

16:44.788 --> 16:47.655
Bigger is better...
if you're over 30.

16:47.657 --> 16:49.407
Go on.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.743
- Simon, you're over 30, right?
- Zach, I'll never tell.

16:51.745 --> 16:55.446
Let's take a look at a few
images from this old man's life.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.547
- His car. - Mm.
- His vacation house.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.299
I lost that in the divorce.

16:58.301 --> 17:00.301
The last woman
he seriously dated.

17:00.303 --> 17:01.502
I gained her in the divorce.

17:01.504 --> 17:03.004
Older people love big things.

17:03.006 --> 17:05.839
But us younger folks, we know
that smaller is the place to be.

17:05.842 --> 17:06.925
The iPad Mini.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.926
The Fiat 500.

17:08.929 --> 17:11.295
Josh Hutcherson. Who doesn't
want all these things?

17:11.297 --> 17:12.931
All right, fine. I'm in.

17:12.933 --> 17:14.848
- I'll take the smaller room.
- Ah...

17:14.851 --> 17:16.467
- Wait, no, I want it!
- Wait. Kelsi, what are you doing?

17:16.469 --> 17:18.435
I love Josh Hutcherson.
I love smaller rooms.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.154
This is so Sagittarius of you.

17:20.156 --> 17:21.973
(gasps) Take that back!

17:21.974 --> 17:24.092
(clamoring) Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:24.094 --> 17:25.143
SIMON:
Break it up!

17:25.145 --> 17:28.029
(clamor continues)

17:28.031 --> 17:30.748
Sister fights only end in tears!

17:30.750 --> 17:33.835
MAN:
Hey! Hey!

17:33.837 --> 17:36.371
What is going on?

17:36.373 --> 17:37.922
- Martin!
- Daddy!

17:37.924 --> 17:40.491
I just came by to take Kelsi
to lunch. What's happening here?

17:40.493 --> 17:41.542
I-I can explain.

17:41.544 --> 17:43.378
No, I'll explain.
(panting)

17:43.380 --> 17:46.347
This internship has been
the worst experience of my life.

17:46.349 --> 17:48.332
Worse than that time
that tsunami ruined my vacation

17:48.334 --> 17:50.051
because no one would stop
talking about it!

17:50.053 --> 17:51.469
Slow down. What happened?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.004
I have never been treated
like this.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.889
They were constantly on me:
do this, do that.

17:54.891 --> 17:57.442
And then, when I pointed out
the obvious... that she only got

17:57.444 --> 17:59.944
this job 'cause of her daddy...
she screamed at me!

17:59.946 --> 18:01.863
Is this true?

18:03.699 --> 18:05.700
Yes, it is.

18:05.702 --> 18:07.018
Good.

18:07.020 --> 18:07.869
- What?
- Excuse me?

18:07.871 --> 18:09.153
You and Sydney both grew up

18:09.155 --> 18:10.371
with every advantage.

18:10.373 --> 18:13.741
But unlike me, Simon here
raised a kid who gets it.

18:13.743 --> 18:16.627
She works hard and she's damn
good at what she does, too.

18:16.629 --> 18:19.196
I was hoping that a little time
with the two of these people

18:19.198 --> 18:22.083
would rub off on you,
but... guess I was wrong.

18:22.085 --> 18:25.053
You think I earned this job?

18:25.055 --> 18:27.588
You have always impressed
the hell out of me, and my team.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.841
You see, we've been telling you
that this entire time.

18:29.843 --> 18:30.875
- Yeah.
- We have.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.643
I know, but you guys
are my friends.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.712
I mean, it...
means so much more

18:34.714 --> 18:36.380
coming from someone
I barely know.

18:36.382 --> 18:38.316
- I totally understand that.
- Well, no duh.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.601
You know, it's only normal to worry
about what people think about you.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.236
I go through that all the time.

18:42.238 --> 18:44.722
But, Dad, you're a genius.
I mean, you're a legend.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.991
- We all want to be just like you.
- Oh, come on.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.359
You have to say that.
You're my daughter.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.610
You do seem
pretty cool, Mr. R.

18:49.612 --> 18:52.330
You really think so?
Oh, my God. Thank you.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.231
Wow. That does feel good.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.917
- Told you.
- Whatever. You're still old.

18:55.919 --> 18:57.702
Oh, Kelsi.

18:57.704 --> 18:59.587
You look kind of sad.

18:59.589 --> 19:01.839
(camera clicks) Oh, what?!

19:01.841 --> 19:04.509
You just got 'grammed,
sister friend.

19:06.795 --> 19:09.013
How do I upload this?

19:14.651 --> 19:16.401
And then after they left,
Zach came back

19:16.403 --> 19:17.836
and said we should
have breakup sex.

19:17.838 --> 19:18.987
But I couldn't.

19:18.989 --> 19:20.105
What do you mean?

19:20.107 --> 19:22.057
Well, my Zach habit
had become all tied up

19:22.059 --> 19:24.059
and connected
with my Andrew habit.

19:24.061 --> 19:25.661
Without having coffee
with Andrew first,

19:25.663 --> 19:28.497
I wasn't in the mood
to have sex with Zach. I did it.

19:28.499 --> 19:31.116
I broke the habit.
I don't want Zach at all now.

19:31.118 --> 19:34.703
Very happy for you. We're all
moved by your strength.

19:34.705 --> 19:37.089
I do feel bad
about Andrew though.

19:37.091 --> 19:41.493
He still seems a bit upset
by the whole situation.

19:42.846 --> 19:45.080
(sighs)

19:45.082 --> 19:49.051
Do you think there's something
I could do to make it up?

19:49.053 --> 19:51.186
Like buy him one of those
single cup coffee machines?

19:51.188 --> 19:53.222
That would just
be rubbing it in.

19:53.224 --> 19:56.041
Or maybe leading him on.
I don't know.

19:56.043 --> 19:57.359
Maybe just avoid it.

19:57.361 --> 19:59.928
I just wish something good
would happen for him.

19:59.930 --> 20:03.315
Hey. You're an older guy.

20:03.317 --> 20:04.983
I'm mad at my dad.

20:04.985 --> 20:06.434
Want to get out of here?

20:06.436 --> 20:08.403
- Yes.
- Mm.

20:11.541 --> 20:12.941
Did I do that?

20:12.943 --> 20:14.276
Did I make that happen?

20:14.295 --> 20:18.643

Ow.
(laughs)

20:24.138 --> 20:27.172
C-Can you not smash
my Adam's apple?

20:27.174 --> 20:30.625
(sputtering, slurping)

20:30.627 --> 20:32.678
Nonalcoholic wine is a bit
like a nerve vibrator.

20:32.680 --> 20:33.929
Interesting choice.

20:33.931 --> 20:35.347
(laughter)

20:35.349 --> 20:37.132
Interesting... Oh, I'm so...

20:37.134 --> 20:38.984
If you are trying,
then that is really pathetic,

20:38.986 --> 20:41.103
and you should just go back
to whatever Disney hell

20:41.105 --> 20:42.005
you came from!

20:42.637 --> 20:44.464
Now you see,
that's yelling.
