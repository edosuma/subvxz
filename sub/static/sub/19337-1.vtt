00:02.036 --> 00:03.302
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Martel de Guise.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.237
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.238
Tell me why you're here.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.506
I came back for you, darling.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.108
You're lying.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.476
Just like you lied
when we were together.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.478
Are you sure?
Our future...

00:12.480 --> 00:15.080
Nothing is certain
but my feelings for you.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.315
CATHERINE:
Leith, protect my daughter.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.716
I give you my blessing to wed.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.519
May you have a long
and happy life.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.587
Will you marry me?

00:21.589 --> 00:22.454
Yes!

00:22.456 --> 00:23.655
Yes.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.191
I have a message for you
from the De Guises.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.761
It seems my would-be assassin
is a Catholic radical.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.496
He confessed
the two of you

00:30.498 --> 00:33.265
worked together to plan
the details of my murder.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.735
And it was all by the order
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.771
There was an assassination
attempt on Elizabeth.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.773
<i> Lola was said to be involved.</i>
<i> She was beheaded.</i>

00:40.775 --> 00:42.674
MARY:<i> Where was Narcisse? </i>
BASH:<i> He's in prison.</i>

00:42.676 --> 00:44.276
Reverend Knox, it was you.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.612
You don't think
that I would confess

00:46.614 --> 00:47.746
to trying
to kill a queen?

00:47.748 --> 00:48.814
You used Lola

00:48.816 --> 00:50.783
so that my sister Mary

00:50.785 --> 00:52.084
would be tied to the attempt.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.419
So that even
if it failed,

00:53.421 --> 00:54.686
it would become personal

00:54.688 --> 00:56.088
between Mary and Elizabeth.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.756
Every choice I make

00:57.758 --> 01:00.225
will be in service
of taking her throne.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.460
Her nation.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.063
Someday it will be mine.

Come on, you know
I like fighting.

01:49.643 --> 01:52.611
When there are two queens
vying for the same throne,

01:52.613 --> 01:54.580
only one can survive.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.281
Me or Elizabeth.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.650
Is that why you've reached out
to Lord Darnley?

01:58.652 --> 02:00.419
Darnley is willing
to travel

02:00.421 --> 02:01.753
to Scotland
to begin courtship.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.156
You know that will
infuriate Elizabeth.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.724
Darnley's family
has been hovering

02:05.726 --> 02:07.593
near the English
throne for years.

02:07.595 --> 02:11.396
Because his family
has their own claim.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.732
He has many allies in England
who would support him.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.868
Imagine our claims
together.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.270
Wed, I would offer England
a king

02:18.272 --> 02:20.205
and the promise of a royal heir,

02:20.207 --> 02:23.876
both things which Elizabeth
has refused to provide.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.444
Darnley comes from
a family of vipers

02:25.446 --> 02:26.678
who've a reputation

02:26.680 --> 02:27.813
for ruthless ambition.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.348
Not to mention

02:29.350 --> 02:32.417
he overindulges
in women and drink.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.686
Elizabeth executed my friend.

02:34.688 --> 02:35.687
I'm not looking

02:35.689 --> 02:37.222
for a man to love,

02:37.224 --> 02:39.324
I'm looking for a weapon
to use against her

02:39.326 --> 02:40.692
to take her throne.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.561
And yet, you would
be wed to the man.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.163
A Catholic man.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.198
Scotland is Protestant now.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
I have no intention
of changing it back.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.635
Well, the Protestants
won't think that

02:49.637 --> 02:51.370
if you give them
a Catholic king.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.871
Marry Darnley,

02:52.873 --> 02:55.574
and Knox will turn
this country against you.

02:55.576 --> 02:58.310
But to take England,
I need power,

02:58.312 --> 02:59.878
and I've made inquiries
about Darnley...

02:59.880 --> 03:02.247
There will always
be powerful suitors.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.651
Look, you've been back
barely a month

03:05.653 --> 03:08.554
and already you have marriage
offers from Highlanders:

03:08.556 --> 03:09.888
Clan Sutherland,
Hamilton, Clan Gordon...

03:09.890 --> 03:12.257
Clan Gordon?
"The Rulers of the North."

03:12.259 --> 03:13.458
They're Catholic, too.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.594
You don't have
to take a husband

03:15.596 --> 03:16.795
from any of these clans.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.364
You just need
their loyalty.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.900
Win the clans to your side,
one by one,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.469
and then march on Elizabeth,

03:24.471 --> 03:26.672
with all of Scotland
behind you.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.907
Wise counsel.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.309
I'll consider it.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.744
Now, pick up your sword.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.946
(sighs)

03:33.948 --> 03:35.380
(birds trilling)

03:35.382 --> 03:36.848
WOMAN:
<i> It is so kind</i>

03:36.850 --> 03:38.584
of you to invite me
back to court again,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.352
Queen Elizabeth,
it's been ages.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.287
I, um, love
what you've done

03:42.289 --> 03:43.522
with the royal library.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.923
I had hoped your son Darnley

03:44.925 --> 03:46.325
would be joining us,
Lady Lennox.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.794
Oh, you wanted
to see Darnley?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.796
My dear, I had no idea.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.997
I sent for both of you.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.533
My invitation was quite clear.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.336
Well, my vision
is deteriorating.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.638
I must confess,
I find letters

03:59.640 --> 04:02.541
impossible to read now.
And yet,

04:02.543 --> 04:04.276
I hear rumors
you are corresponding

04:04.278 --> 04:05.477
with my cousin Mary--

04:05.479 --> 04:06.878
arranging
a royal marriage

04:06.880 --> 04:08.814
between her and your son.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.816
My enemies' rumors,
I assure you.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.017
My son is no threat.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.553
Then tell me...

04:14.555 --> 04:15.954
(whispering):
...where is Darnley?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.290
Honestly, I have no idea.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.491
He goes where he likes...

04:19.493 --> 04:22.027
as grown men do.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.297
But if I hear from him,
I will be sure to let you know.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.836
I'm not sure you appreciate

04:30.838 --> 04:33.438
the urgency of the situation,
Lady Lennox.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.841
Queen Mary tried to have me
assassinated

04:35.843 --> 04:37.776
here in England.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.812
She is my enemy,
and if Darnley pursues her,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.582
he will be my enemy as well.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.284
Tell your son to come to court.

04:45.286 --> 04:49.655
Or I will have him dragged
here on his knees.

Here in Spain
thousands of Moors and Jews

If, after the persuasion
of torture,

then they agree.

mad with desire.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.375
(scoffs)

05:43.377 --> 05:45.777
I had to get away
from the gossip.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.112
Well, how odd.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.915
I assure you, by the
time Don Carlos left here,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.917
he had quite recovered.

05:51.919 --> 05:52.984
He has good days and bad,
Mother,

05:52.986 --> 05:54.386
but he is not the same man.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.722
Well, surely you
don't blame me.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.058
All I know is that the prince
of Spain came to France whole,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.660
and left with
an enormous piece of wood

06:01.662 --> 06:02.694
sticking out of his skull.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.696
That is not true.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.532
We had our finest
surgeon remove it.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.371
Your mother looks different.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.606
Dressed to impress my sister,
Queen Leeza.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.708
Her letters implied
she'd become quite pious

06:16.710 --> 06:17.943
since marrying
the king of Spain.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.479
Now, Leeza, do sit.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.031
Tell me, how is your husband,

06:40.033 --> 06:42.968
King Philip?
Concerned.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.436
What is Charles doing to stem
the rising tide

06:44.438 --> 06:45.637
of Protestantism?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.406
Well, you could ask him
yourself,

06:47.408 --> 06:48.874
if only he weren't in Paris.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.443
There is a fire burning
across your land,

06:51.445 --> 06:54.579
and we want it put out
before it reaches our borders.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.547
Look at Mary in Scotland.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.648
How long will she stay afloat

06:56.650 --> 06:57.749
in a sea of heretics?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.818
Philip thinks you need to draw

06:59.820 --> 07:01.853
your Catholic nobles closer.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.989
Secure their loyalty,
their gold.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.591
Spain can't fund
this court forever.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.026
Claude,

07:08.028 --> 07:09.795
Martel, come closer.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.832
A union between the Valois
and the Guise family--

07:13.834 --> 07:17.102
loyal, fierce Catholics--
strengthens the realm

07:17.104 --> 07:18.470
as well as the faith.

07:18.472 --> 07:19.838
A marriage, you mean.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.440
Your marriage.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.742
Martel and I have
discussed this at length.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.610
You! Comforting me
these last weeks

07:25.612 --> 07:27.446
about the man I love.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.614
Is she talking about
that dead kitchen boy?

07:29.616 --> 07:30.849
Leith is a soldier

07:30.851 --> 07:31.883
and he is the bravest

07:31.885 --> 07:33.618
and kindest man
I've ever known.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.887
He is alive and
he is coming back to me.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.156
And, Mother, you promised...

07:38.158 --> 07:39.524
Claude, you misunderstand.
That you're a snake?

07:39.526 --> 07:40.625
A parasite?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.927
I don't think so.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.029
I'm marrying Leith,
Mother, tell her.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.932
You gave your permission,
tell her!

07:49.002 --> 07:51.169
(Claude sighs)

07:51.171 --> 07:53.038
(footfalls receding)

07:53.040 --> 07:55.640
Apparently Claude does not
understand the role of princess.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.509
Speak to her.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.777
Make her see
the benefits of this.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.213
Specifically?

08:01.215 --> 08:02.914
It would please Spain,

08:02.916 --> 08:05.750
the most powerful country
in the world, very much.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.991
Greer.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.695
I wasn't sure you'd make it
in time for Lola's funeral.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.098
How was your journey
from France?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.033
And where is your
darling baby girl?

08:22.035 --> 08:25.103
Little Rose stayed behind with
Castleroy, but I had to come.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.974
How have you been adjusting
to Scotland?

08:28.976 --> 08:31.776
I hope your brother's
been helping you.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.111
He is.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.780
But he has been ruling
Scotland for years

08:35.782 --> 08:37.115
by playing all sides,

08:37.117 --> 08:38.917
and I'm worried he's
playing me as well.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.186
In truth, it's been
rather lonely.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.754
Bash is gone,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.055
and Gideon has returned
to English court.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.058
I don't know if I'll
ever see him again.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.827
I thought you and Gideon loved
each other-- what happened?

08:50.230 --> 08:52.797
I asked him to be my agent

08:52.799 --> 08:56.034
to seduce Elizabeth,
and he refused.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.970
If your lover refused
to sleep with your rival,

08:58.972 --> 09:00.772
maybe that's a good sign.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.311
Well...

09:06.313 --> 09:08.980
I suppose it's time
to say good-bye.

09:08.982 --> 09:13.585
<i> Lola Fleming Narcisse</i>
<i> was a mother and a wife.</i>

09:13.587 --> 09:16.855
<i> She was my lady</i>
<i> and my dear, dear friend.</i>

09:16.857 --> 09:18.723
<i> She shall never be forgotten.</i>

09:18.725 --> 09:22.994
♪ How can I say this
without breaking? ♪

09:22.996 --> 09:29.134
♪ How can I put it down
into words? ♪

09:29.136 --> 09:32.270
♪ When it's almost too much ♪

09:48.088 --> 09:50.822
(sighs)

09:50.824 --> 09:52.591
Are you all right?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.025
I'm suddenly
not feeling well.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.627
I-I think I'm just tired.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.028
I'm going to return
to the castle.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.229
I'll come with you.
No.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.632
Stay with
Lola's parents.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.370
(church bell rings)
(horses whinny)

10:08.775 --> 10:12.110
(faint neighing)

10:13.780 --> 10:15.880
Where are we going?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.782
The castle is
in the other direction.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.150
Where are my guards?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.319
Stop!
Something's wrong.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.655
We need to stop the carriage...

10:23.657 --> 10:25.123
Oh, I need to get out.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.992
It's all right.
It'll all be over soon.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.230
(horses neigh)

10:39.172 --> 10:40.171
James!

10:40.173 --> 10:41.940
James, I need your help!

10:41.942 --> 10:44.943
Oh, uh... uh...

10:44.945 --> 10:47.078
I'm sorry,
but it's urgent.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.380
(clears throat)
Leave us?

10:55.022 --> 10:56.187
I think Mary's been kidnapped.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.689
What?

10:57.691 --> 11:00.091
Tell me exactly what happened.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.093
Uh...

11:02.095 --> 11:03.695
we, uh, we were
at the funeral service,

11:03.697 --> 11:05.230
and Mary left
in the royal carriage,

11:05.232 --> 11:06.698
but it never arrived here.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.832
We found her driver
and some guards

11:07.834 --> 11:08.833
outside the church.

11:08.835 --> 11:09.834
They'd been drugged.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.703
So she was taken
by impostors?

11:11.705 --> 11:14.839
She wasn't feeling well,
that's why she left alone.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.274
We had just taken Mass
with Father Corman...

11:16.276 --> 11:18.743
Wait, Father Corman was there?

11:18.745 --> 11:19.878
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.981
Corman's parish
is far up north.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.115
What is it?

11:24.117 --> 11:25.717
"The rulers of the north."

11:25.719 --> 11:26.985
It's likely
Clan Gordon

11:26.987 --> 11:29.988
has Mary,
and I think I know why.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.728
(gasps)

11:36.730 --> 11:38.396
Where am I?

11:38.398 --> 11:39.898
Who are you?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.266
Welcome to the north.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.934
I am the Earl of Clan Gordon.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.036
How did I get
all the way up here?

11:45.038 --> 11:48.039
Father Corman added something
extra to your Communion wafer.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.808
You drugged me?

11:49.810 --> 11:50.875
Don't be afraid.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.411
You're among
Catholic allies here.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.914
Our clan protects you
from your Protestant enemies.

11:55.916 --> 11:57.282
Then why did you bring me here?

11:57.284 --> 11:59.350
Because we need
something in return.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.326
(music playing, crowd clamoring)

12:14.301 --> 12:16.768
She's here!
The bride's awake!

12:16.770 --> 12:17.836
"The bride"?

12:17.838 --> 12:18.903
(all cheering, clamoring)

12:18.905 --> 12:20.338
Make room!
Give her some space!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.407
You had me kidnapped,

12:22.409 --> 12:24.142
and now you expect me
to marry you?

12:24.144 --> 12:25.176
Of course not.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.878
You're going
to marry my son.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.113
The hell I am.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.281
Where on earth is George?
Come forward, George.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.916
(all clamoring)

12:31.918 --> 12:33.418
Meet Mary.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.019
Our queen.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.489
Well, don't faint
on the girl.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.857
Yeah, Your Majesty,
I, uh...

12:38.859 --> 12:40.825
Forgive me, I have palpitations.

12:40.827 --> 12:43.294
I will not marry him.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.029
You<i> will</i> marry my son.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.965
If you want
to keep your throne,

12:46.967 --> 12:49.267
that is.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.903
You'd have to be careful.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.839
Gideon, welcome back.

12:54.841 --> 12:57.242
Your Majesty.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.780
Some unfamiliar faces.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.348
They're advisors.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.450
I've been consulting with them
after the attempt on my life.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.185
Did you gain any

13:07.187 --> 13:08.486
information in Scotland?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.455
Queen Mary maintains
her innocence.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.956
She's lying.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.359
Lola admitted the
order came from Mary.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.393
But what if Lola was wrong?

13:15.395 --> 13:16.494
Used by someone.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.062
What does Narcisse say?

13:18.064 --> 13:19.964
After having stabbed
two of my guards,

13:19.966 --> 13:21.833
Narcisse is imprisoned
in the tower

13:21.835 --> 13:23.535
and refuses to
speak to anyone.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.470
Except about the food.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.505
That is a topic on
which he is quite vocal.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.374
And Lola's child?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.109
John and the nanny are gone.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.843
Lola surely planned an
escape for after my death.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.012
They could already
be in France.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.480
But this is all irrelevant.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.883
Mary is circling Lord Darnley
as a candidate for marriage.

13:38.885 --> 13:39.884
Darnley?

13:39.886 --> 13:41.586
They are cousins
of their own.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.287
Both of legitimate
royal descent.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.257
Unlike me, their bloodline
is unassailable.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.259
Further removed, Your Majesty.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.228
There are two of them
and one of me.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.263
Darnley must
be found.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.899
And Mary neutralized.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.034
Neutralized?

13:56.036 --> 13:59.137
Mary tried to strike me down.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.872
I will retaliate
in kind.

14:00.874 --> 14:01.873
I need you

14:01.875 --> 14:03.241
to focus all your resources

14:03.243 --> 14:05.210
on the manhunt for Darnley.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.346
Leave the lord chancellor
of France to rot in his cell.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.916
Yes, Your Majesty.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.360
GUARD:
In here, my lord.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.862
(door opens)

14:25.632 --> 14:27.131
Lord Narcisse.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.900
I'm Gideon Blackburn.
We met in France.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.571
I know why you're
refusing to speak.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.441
You're afraid of being
implicated in your wife's crime.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.276
But you can trust me.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.979
I know you weren't involved
and neither was Mary.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.381
You're surprised
to hear that, aren't you?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.216
But I had Mary's word
on the topic.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.518
She would never put
a friend in danger like that.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
She would if her country
were at risk.

14:49.522 --> 14:52.090
Elizabeth was on the edge
of taking Scotland.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.591
And Lola would
never have done it

14:53.593 --> 14:55.994
unless the order came from Mary.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.662
When Renee gave
Lola the letter, it...

14:57.664 --> 14:59.030
Wait.

14:59.032 --> 14:59.998
Renee delivered the message?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.232
John's nanny?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.467
She was the only one way
to get messages

15:02.469 --> 15:04.035
in and out of the castle.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.205
But if the order was forged...

15:07.207 --> 15:08.339
If Lola was
only meant to believe

15:08.341 --> 15:09.474
the order came from Mary.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.643
Renee could have
been involved.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.313
I left Lola's son with her.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.615
In hiding, waiting to flee.

15:17.617 --> 15:20.018
Now, if Renee betrayed my wife,
and her own queen,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.353
what might she do
to a child left behind?

15:22.355 --> 15:23.688
An afterthought, a complication.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.089
Where do I find them?
They were waiting

15:25.091 --> 15:26.624
for me at an inn
east of the village.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.192
Start there.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.595
You find John!

15:30.597 --> 15:32.430
I promised Lola

15:32.432 --> 15:33.631
that I would protect her son.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.034
And now it is up to you.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.208
Would you really marry me off,
just because she says so?

15:44.210 --> 15:46.644
Tell Leeza no!
Tell her you promised me!

15:46.646 --> 15:49.380
Claude, a promise will not
bring Leith back to you.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.182
He's alive.
Well, then where is he?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.952
It has been weeks since our
forces crushed the Red Knights.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.987
If he were dead,
I would know it.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.089
I would feel it in my bones!
Darling,

15:58.091 --> 15:59.524
that is a fantasy of love.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.326
And not one
that I can use

16:01.328 --> 16:03.594
to defy orders
from the king of Spain.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.596
And is Spain ruling France now?

16:06.733 --> 16:08.132
Not yet.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.668
They could soon enough.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.571
The religious divide
in France has weakened us,

16:13.573 --> 16:16.341
while Spain,
staunchly Catholic...

16:16.343 --> 16:17.608
You mean "repressive."

16:17.610 --> 16:19.010
...has remained strong.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.411
If we slaughter
our Protestants now,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.146
we risk civil war.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.216
France will crumble
and Spain will step in.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.485
If we do nothing,
we anger the Vatican,

16:27.487 --> 16:29.187
who will end our line.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.023
And Spain will step in.

16:32.025 --> 16:35.727
We will lose our throne,
followed by our heads.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.329
She's a bully and I hate her!

16:38.331 --> 16:40.331
I shouldn't have
to marry someone I despise!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.332
But you must be
more diplomatic

16:41.334 --> 16:43.067
in your response
to a nation

16:43.069 --> 16:44.569
that can crush us.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.038
Just until I can find
a way out of it.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.041
You don't want me
married to Martel, either?

16:50.043 --> 16:51.259
I had his father killed.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.476
Do you think I want him
rising in station?

16:52.479 --> 16:54.512
(knocking)

16:55.382 --> 16:58.583
Lord Martel de Guise.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.651
We were just speaking of you.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.753
MARTEL:
I'm not surprised.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.355
Uh, I realize the talk

17:04.357 --> 17:05.590
of our marriage
was a shock,

17:05.592 --> 17:07.225
so I want you to
know that I understand

17:07.227 --> 17:09.794
your harsh response,
though it was humiliating.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.629
Nevertheless,
I hope

17:11.631 --> 17:13.131
it's a union you'll consider.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.533
Once you've come to terms
with the realities.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.069
To that end,
I've brought you this.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.477
I wrote this to Leith.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.379
It was found weeks ago on
one of the burned bodies.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.814
I thought it cruel to put
it into your hands,

17:29.816 --> 17:32.450
but if it helps
you accept his...

17:32.452 --> 17:35.386
Leith is gone, Claude,
and I am here.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.487
Prepared to marry you.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.822
To make you happy.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.390
To placate Spain.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.825
And keep the Valois
on the throne.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.527
As a friend
to your family,

17:42.529 --> 17:44.796
to you, I urge
you to say yes.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.632
(knocking)

17:47.634 --> 17:50.268
Renee, are you there?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.335
It's Gideon Blackburn.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.237
Lord Narcisse sent me.
I'm alone.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.640
I'm here to help you
and the boy.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.144
(gasping)

18:00.146 --> 18:02.313
Don't come any closer.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.681
Renee, it's all right.
Don't be afraid.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.483
I'm not here to hurt you
or the boy.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.218
I know you were part

18:07.220 --> 18:08.553
of the assassination
attempt on Elizabeth.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.288
But there's a way out of this.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.223
You have information
the queen wants.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.391
You know who was
really behind

18:13.393 --> 18:15.359
the attempt on her life.
It wasn't Mary.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.162
So...

18:18.164 --> 18:19.797
tell me who sent that message.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.699
I can't.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.402
If he finds out I've talked,
he'll hurt my family.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.670
He'll have them
torn to pieces

18:25.672 --> 18:27.238
by their own neighbors!

18:27.240 --> 18:28.372
Who?
Give me a name.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.175
E-Elizabeth will protect
your family.

18:31.177 --> 18:32.677
She can't protect them!
They're in Scotland!

18:32.679 --> 18:36.247
I know of one man in Scotland
with that kind of influence.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.549
A man who preaches hatred
when it suits him.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.318
Who'd love to see the two
queens destroy each other.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.453
It's John Knox.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.256
(crying)
Don't move!

18:45.258 --> 18:46.524
I have archers
outside that window.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.159
If you make any sudden move,

18:48.161 --> 18:49.694
if they see that blade
in your hand, they'll kill you.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.329
Put the blade down

18:51.331 --> 18:53.631
and let me take the boy.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.634
(crying)

18:59.272 --> 19:00.204
Hey.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.173
What will happen
to me?

19:02.175 --> 19:04.342
You will be questioned,
but you will be protected.

19:05.545 --> 19:07.845
I don't believe you.
I can't go back.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.547
No!
(grunts)

19:09.549 --> 19:10.715
(crying)

19:14.354 --> 19:17.255
(birds chirping)

19:17.257 --> 19:18.289
KNOX:
James.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.624
JAMES:
Reverend Knox.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.159
KNOX: I hear our queen
has been abducted.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.727
Is it true?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.195
You might as well
tell me the details.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.396
I'll learn them anyway.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.232
We believe it was Clan
Gordon who took her.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.434
Their proposals to the
queen had gone unanswered.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.436
So they kidnapped her,
as is their tradition.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.638
They're lovely people,
aren't they?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.672
Good Catholics.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.408
Let me help
return Mary to safety.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.510
The fastest way to Clan Gordon's
castle is across a bridge

19:39.512 --> 19:41.379
controlled by the Duarr family.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.648
Protestants loyal to me.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.101
I can ensure access.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.553
Why are you so eager
to save a queen you loathe?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.421
My reason is the same as yours.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.523
To stop her
marrying a Catholic.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.958
Especially a member
of Clan Gordon.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.927
And if I accept your help?

19:55.929 --> 19:57.228
Well, in return,

19:57.230 --> 19:58.496
after rescuing Mary,

19:58.498 --> 20:01.299
you wipe out the entire clan.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.800
We can extinguish

20:02.802 --> 20:04.468
Mary's hard-line
Catholic support,

20:04.470 --> 20:06.837
and no one will blame us.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.941
Clan Gordon is
Mary's last stronghold

20:09.943 --> 20:11.709
of Catholics in the north.
Mm.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.511
Without them...

20:13.513 --> 20:14.745
Oh, she will be weakened

20:14.747 --> 20:16.681
and, in time, fall.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.816
Sooner than later
would be my choice.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.585
Why drag out
the inevitable?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.889
You're asking me to plot
against my sister.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.290
I'm asking you

20:26.292 --> 20:27.725
to choose the winning side.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.696
This is our chance, James.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.464
And it won't come again.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.401
I am your queen

20:37.403 --> 20:39.604
and I order you to return me
to Edinburgh at once.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.972
You're not going anywhere
until you marry my son.

20:40.974 --> 20:42.573
I won't.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.408
And besides,
you're running out of time.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.444
My brother and his soldiers
will be on their way.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.312
Your bastard half brother will
be the first to betray you

20:48.314 --> 20:49.880
when he gets the chance.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.316
Don't you speak of my brother.
(laughing):
Why?

20:52.318 --> 20:54.285
I've watched James and Knox
work together for years,

20:54.287 --> 20:55.920
even protect
each other.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.722
They're closer than you think.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.890
You want me to believe that
all Protestants are against me,

20:59.892 --> 21:01.292
even my brother.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.427
But I don't think that way.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.396
I won't judge a man
by his faith.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.764
You're not a tolerant queen,

21:06.766 --> 21:08.499
you're a sheep
surrounded by wolves.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.501
And a fool to refuse
our protection.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.303
Very well.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.505
You need a knife to
your throat, here it is:

21:14.507 --> 21:16.574
if you don't marry my son, Clan
Gordon will turn against you.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.909
When your Catholic allies
become your enemies,

21:18.911 --> 21:21.412
do you think the Protestants
will save you?

21:21.414 --> 21:24.849
You'll have an entire nation
united against their queen.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.851
And that is how
your reign will end.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.786
Alone in your castle,

21:28.788 --> 21:30.855
while outside your people
call for your head.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.456
Enough.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.593
Tell your son I will meet
with him in private.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.796
And tell him
I will accept his proposal.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.606
You disobeyed my orders:
I told you to find Darnley.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.874
If I'd obeyed you,
we wouldn't know John Knox

21:49.876 --> 21:52.576
tried to have you
killed, not Mary...

21:52.578 --> 21:55.646
Knox is a respected
Protestant leader.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.515
I can't go after him
without evidence--

21:57.517 --> 21:59.850
evidence that died along
with your witness Renee.

21:59.852 --> 22:01.052
What do you
expect me to do?

22:01.054 --> 22:03.387
I want the truth
to inform your decisions.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.922
You're plotting
the downfall of someone

22:04.924 --> 22:07.391
who played no part in this
assassination attempt.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.393
You are desperate to
absolve Mary, aren't you?

22:09.395 --> 22:10.561
(exhales)

22:10.563 --> 22:11.962
You're right.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.798
I do care for her
more than I should.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.466
Certainly more
than I ever intended.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.702
But no matter what
I feel about Mary,

22:17.704 --> 22:18.969
I am an Englishman.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.806
I have my family here,
and I serve you first.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.841
I mean, I don't want
to see my country descend

22:23.843 --> 22:25.076
into more bloodshed and war.

22:25.078 --> 22:27.545
And I don't want
to see you in danger.

22:27.547 --> 22:30.414
You admitted to falling
for my rival.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.749
How do I know

22:31.751 --> 22:34.618
she hasn't turned
you against me?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.554
I'm not against you, Elizabeth.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.988
I know you feel
your cousin

22:37.990 --> 22:39.957
is your enemy
and you must be hers in return.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.593
But the two of you are
so consumed with each other,

22:42.595 --> 22:43.828
you didn't notice
Knox in the corner,

22:43.830 --> 22:45.629
cheering you on
to fight to the death.

22:45.631 --> 22:47.565
Now you have a chance at peace.

22:47.567 --> 22:50.968
Mary is just over the border,
closer than she's ever been.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.837
Meet with her,
talk to each other...

22:52.839 --> 22:54.038
To what end?

22:54.040 --> 22:55.573
So we can share

22:55.575 --> 22:57.108
in our burdens?
Tell me this:

22:57.110 --> 22:58.976
does Mary want my throne?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.978
You murdered her friend,

23:00.980 --> 23:02.980
England moved on her nation...
(chuckles)

23:02.982 --> 23:05.883
In other words, yes, or why
would she seek out Darnley?

23:05.885 --> 23:08.519
The reality is so simple.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.621
Stop pretending you
don't understand.

23:10.623 --> 23:14.792
Mary and I are positioned
against one other as rivals

23:14.794 --> 23:16.460
by blood, by history,

23:16.462 --> 23:18.629
by men whose power
is tied to our own,

23:18.631 --> 23:20.531
and it will always be so.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.032
We are not just rulers,

23:22.034 --> 23:24.034
we are pawns
in a much larger game.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.637
The last thing I want

23:26.639 --> 23:28.839
is to know her,

23:28.841 --> 23:30.174
to feel for her, if...

23:30.176 --> 23:32.810
If one day you have to kill her.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.479
Yes.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.550
Your Majesty,
you're on the path to war.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.120
And you need to see the cost.

23:48.628 --> 23:50.961
John.

23:50.963 --> 23:54.064
He knows you
as his mother's friend.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.534
He still calls
out for her.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.469
I don't think
he understands

23:58.471 --> 24:00.571
that Lola is never,
ever coming back.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.808
As the reality is so simple,

24:03.810 --> 24:05.543
perhaps you could
explain it to him.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.758
(owl hooting)

24:20.760 --> 24:22.660
(music playing,
indistinct chatter)

24:22.662 --> 24:24.929
LEEZA:
Was there any progress made

24:24.931 --> 24:27.064
in getting to the bottom
of who killed Martel's father?

24:27.066 --> 24:29.667
Protestants, it was assumed.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.569
It was a roadside attack.
Oh.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.903
Were they ever caught?

24:32.905 --> 24:34.104
Sadly, no.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.806
The Church might want

24:35.808 --> 24:37.041
to open a proper inquiry.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.943
For closure.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.478
You understand.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.926
Don't.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.161
(grunting):
No.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.698
(crying):
He killed Leith.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.066
Martel?

25:02.068 --> 25:03.100
Tell me why you suspect him.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.735
The love letter.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.071
I wrote it.
But it couldn't have been found

25:07.073 --> 25:09.240
on Leith's burned body,
as he claims.
Why?

25:09.242 --> 25:12.109
Because it was a letter I wrote
long before he left.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.111
And it was left here.
I know,

25:14.113 --> 25:15.946
because I saw it
in Leith's room only days ago.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.681
I spoke to
those witnesses,

25:17.683 --> 25:19.116
as you suggested.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.951
They recognized
the Guise sigil.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.887
It was Martel's man
that slaughtered Leith.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.688
But they were afraid.

25:24.690 --> 25:28.259
I-I... I don't know
if they'd speak against him.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.660
No.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.929
The Guise are powerful.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.231
Especially now that they've
aligned themselves with Spain.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.033
Oh, this is the last
thing that we need...

25:36.035 --> 25:38.002
Leeza getting in
the middle of all of this.

25:38.004 --> 25:40.170
Dredging up old wrongs.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.074
I told you
I would find a way

25:44.076 --> 25:45.943
out of this marriage
and I will.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.311
How?

25:47.313 --> 25:49.013
We'll kill Martel together.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.582
After which,
I hope you'll realize

25:51.584 --> 25:54.051
Mother is always
on your side.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.225
(clears throat)

26:01.227 --> 26:02.760
Oh...

26:02.762 --> 26:04.128
forgive me,
Queen Mary.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.596
Father said
you'd sent for me.

26:05.598 --> 26:06.764
I did send for you.

26:06.766 --> 26:09.567
Help me lace
my dress.

26:09.569 --> 26:10.768
(clears throat)

26:12.138 --> 26:13.637
Yes.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.172
Uh...

26:15.174 --> 26:17.241
I'm terribly sorry
about all this.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.110
Oh, you mean
the wedding?
It really wasn't my idea.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.912
But I've learned
it's best

26:21.914 --> 26:23.881
to obey Father.

26:23.883 --> 26:26.617
Clan Gordon are good people.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.785
I understand.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.120
They are afraid of the earl,

26:30.122 --> 26:32.056
as are you.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.192
But perhaps you should be
more afraid of me.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.327
Why?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.801
I've been wed before

26:43.803 --> 26:45.769
and I am a queen.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.072
Have you ever been
with a queen, George?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.007
No.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.342
Oh, dear, you're
breathing heavily.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.711
Have you ever been with a woman?

26:54.747 --> 26:56.146
Uh...

26:56.148 --> 26:57.348
If you can't perform,

26:57.350 --> 26:58.782
then I have the right

26:58.784 --> 26:59.950
to refuse the marriage.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.285
It's a gamble, but...

27:02.755 --> 27:03.821
Take off your belt.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.723
Oh...
George.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.691
(gasps)

27:07.693 --> 27:09.126
George?

27:19.372 --> 27:20.904
Get back inside.

27:20.906 --> 27:21.972
Now.

After her!

To horse, men, to horse!

♪ ♪

27:41.427 --> 27:42.893
(horse neighs)

27:49.335 --> 27:51.301
Clan Gordon's stronghold
isn't much further.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.437
We'll scout their numbers
and plan our attack.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.906
Once we've rescued
the queen, we'll...
(horse neighs)

27:55.908 --> 27:57.241
(hoofbeats approach)

27:59.712 --> 28:00.844
Mary!

28:00.846 --> 28:02.046
Are you all right?

28:02.048 --> 28:03.847
Yes.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.916
The earl kidnapped me
so I'd marry his son.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.252
The earl of Clan Gordon;
it's as we thought.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.054
How many men do you have?
We need to push north.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.355
I want to get you back
to Edinburgh Castle

28:11.357 --> 28:13.123
where you'll be safe.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.125
My men and I will handle it
from here. We have nearly

28:15.127 --> 28:16.894
a hundred more
just down the road.
A hundred men?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.229
I never imagined
you'd bring so many.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.065
If Clan Gordon puts up a fight,
there'll be a slaughter.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.266
I'll manage it.

28:22.268 --> 28:23.367
You've been through enough.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.835
Escort the queen
back to court.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.170
Why are you so keen
to get rid of me?

28:26.172 --> 28:28.872
And how did you get
so many men here so quickly?

28:28.874 --> 28:31.742
We rode as fast as we could.
Or you took a shortcut.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.243
The bridges that cut
through the north--

28:33.245 --> 28:34.745
you could only use them
with Knox's help.

28:34.747 --> 28:36.080
Did he ask you
for something in return?

28:36.082 --> 28:38.048
I did what I needed
to get to you quickly.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.383
And now that
you're here,

28:39.385 --> 28:42.252
you plan to wipe out
my Catholic supporters?

28:42.254 --> 28:43.921
You can't save them, Mary.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.389
They kidnapped you.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.924
You have to make
a show of force,

28:46.926 --> 28:48.392
or every clan in Scotland
will defy you

28:48.394 --> 28:49.793
until the end of your reign.

28:49.795 --> 28:51.395
I intend to show force.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.996
But if I move too quickly,

28:52.998 --> 28:54.465
I could find myself
at the end of a blade.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.200
We will ride
north together.

28:56.202 --> 28:57.367
We will surround the clan
and demand

28:57.369 --> 28:58.736
that they give up their leader.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.404
The earl will
bend the knee

29:00.406 --> 29:02.339
or he will die.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.276
MAN:
Move out!

29:08.380 --> 29:09.813
(lock clanks)

29:13.252 --> 29:14.985
Lola's son is safe.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.754
He's here at the castle,
being tended to.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.789
(exhales)

29:19.992 --> 29:21.959
John Knox
was responsible for this.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.261
Lola thought she was
following Mary's orders,

29:24.263 --> 29:25.496
but she was following his.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.831
Knox is the true enemy.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.433
If only there
were just one.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.001
My wife is dead.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.136
And you killed her.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.138
Lola betrayed me.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.873
What sentence

29:35.875 --> 29:37.908
would you have given,
had this happened in France?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.209
I had no choice.

29:40.146 --> 29:43.881
Oh, you seek absolution

29:43.883 --> 29:45.048
for killing

29:45.050 --> 29:46.316
your friend.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.285
She wasn't your friend,
Elizabeth,

29:48.287 --> 29:49.453
she was your prisoner.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.255
What a grotesque

29:51.257 --> 29:52.990
curse of royalty,

29:52.992 --> 29:54.925
that you cannot even tell
the difference.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.260
The truth

29:56.262 --> 29:57.528
is that had you not

29:57.530 --> 29:58.996
taken her family hostage,

29:58.998 --> 30:00.564
had you not forced her here,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.299
then Lola would still be alive!

30:02.301 --> 30:04.134
Maybe you're right,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.403
but we confided
in one another as friends do,

30:06.405 --> 30:08.906
and she agreed
to come here

30:08.908 --> 30:10.440
because she was desperate

30:10.442 --> 30:11.875
to get away from you.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.415
Lord Narcisse,
you provided

30:18.417 --> 30:20.551
crucial information
to the Crown.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.187
And as a reward,
I am transferring you

30:23.189 --> 30:24.288
out of the Tower.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.824
You may see
your stepson, John,

30:26.826 --> 30:27.825
and correspond
with French authorities

30:27.827 --> 30:28.959
to negotiate your release.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.296
I don't understand.

30:32.298 --> 30:36.466
John Knox misled me
down a very dark path.

30:36.468 --> 30:40.003
Starting today,
I choose another.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.256
(grunts)

30:59.258 --> 31:00.624
Earl of Gordon,

31:00.626 --> 31:03.260
you are guilty of kidnapping,
extortion

31:03.262 --> 31:04.461
and treason,

31:04.463 --> 31:06.463
but your queen
is merciful.

31:06.465 --> 31:10.200
I am offering you this chance
to beg for my forgiveness.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.237
I won't offer again.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.872
And I won't beg.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.340
You surround yourself
with Protestants:

31:16.342 --> 31:17.875
your guards,

31:17.877 --> 31:19.042
your advisors,

31:19.044 --> 31:20.110
your brother.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.412
Let me go and my clan

31:22.414 --> 31:23.413
will protect you.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.049
(indistinct murmuring)

31:28.621 --> 31:31.288
He's filling your
head with lies.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.023
You can trust
the Protestants.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.057
Can I trust you?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.626
Or are you waiting for my fall,

31:35.628 --> 31:36.994
so that you can rule again?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.529
Mary, I serve you.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.334
Prove your loyalty.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.670
If you wish to remain
by my side,

31:46.672 --> 31:51.241
help me bring order without
losing my Catholic allies.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.442
Kill the earl.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.512
I am not your executioner.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.547
You are today.
I need a Protestant

31:57.549 --> 31:58.682
villain to swing the sword.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.150
Someone the family
can blame.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.586
While you appear merciful

32:02.588 --> 32:03.687
for sparing their lives.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.289
(scoffs)

32:05.291 --> 32:07.157
You're asking me to
make Catholic enemies.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.992
You cannot keep
playing both sides.

32:08.994 --> 32:11.628
And if you wish to remain my
advisor, you will do as I say.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.038
(people shout)

32:25.244 --> 32:26.376
I should kill you all!

32:27.146 --> 32:28.128
I should execute

32:28.129 --> 32:29.111
every last one of you
for your treason.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.314
Enough, James.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.282
The traitor has been punished.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.118
My people,

32:35.120 --> 32:36.987
despite your transgressions,

32:36.989 --> 32:38.522
as Scots,

32:38.524 --> 32:40.624
as Catholics,
you are precious to me.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.093
Clan Gordon will live on.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.263
Its holdings and titles
will remain with the clan

32:46.265 --> 32:48.699
if... you pledge your loyalty.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.475
WOMAN:
Your Majesty.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.643
MAN:
Your Grace.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.179
OTHERS:
Your Majesty.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.549
Were you seen
leaving your chambers?

33:05.551 --> 33:06.583
No.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.418
That is, I don't
believe so.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.419
Is it awful if I was?

33:09.421 --> 33:10.620
You told me to meet you;

33:10.622 --> 33:11.621
you didn't say
anything about...

33:11.623 --> 33:13.056
It's fine.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.558
A daughter
joining her mother

33:14.560 --> 33:16.460
for an evening stroll
is hardly a crime.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.061
(whispering):
No, but murder is.

33:18.063 --> 33:19.296
Why would you
murder Martel?

33:19.298 --> 33:20.364
Are my sins any
less than his?

33:20.366 --> 33:22.199
Will I not be damned...?
Stop.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.067
Killing to avenge
a wrong isn't murder,

33:24.069 --> 33:26.103
it's justice,

33:26.105 --> 33:27.504
and justice cannot be a sin.

33:29.308 --> 33:30.574
You must believe that.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.376
I want to, I do.

33:32.378 --> 33:33.610
Good.

33:33.612 --> 33:34.711
Then I need you to scream.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.446
Scream?
Why would I...?

33:36.448 --> 33:38.682
(screams)

33:41.587 --> 33:43.220
Guards!

33:43.222 --> 33:44.388
Guards!
(whispering): Act shocked.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.489
I am shocked!

33:45.491 --> 33:46.590
Even better.

33:46.592 --> 33:48.058
Your Majesty.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.326
Oh, he jumped.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.327
It was awful.

33:50.329 --> 33:53.263
We saw the entire thing.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.598
(crying)

33:54.600 --> 33:55.732
The tears might be a bit much.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.068
(crying):
The tears are real.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.136
Leith really is
gone, isn't he?

33:59.138 --> 34:00.337
Martel took him

34:00.339 --> 34:02.205
away forever.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.540
You did this for me.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.075
Why?

34:05.077 --> 34:06.510
Well, it may not be a sin,

34:06.512 --> 34:08.178
but even justice has a price.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.081
It's better the debt be mine.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.090
It's tragic,

34:20.092 --> 34:21.425
but there you have it.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.459
One witness who says Martel

34:22.461 --> 34:23.493
asked for a length of rope,

34:23.495 --> 34:24.528
another who found

34:24.530 --> 34:25.695
this suicide note.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.631
The Guises
do not fare well

34:27.633 --> 34:28.832
at French court, do they?

34:30.836 --> 34:32.436
Did you do this?

34:32.438 --> 34:34.137
No, I swear.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.839
I know you, Mother.
You raised me.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.507
I know how you solve problems.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.077
Martel was no problem.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.244
He was a shamed man.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.712
Harshly refused

34:42.714 --> 34:44.347
by Claude,
publicly humiliated...

34:44.349 --> 34:45.682
Mother!
Did you read the note?

34:45.684 --> 34:47.484
His ego couldn't take it,

34:47.486 --> 34:49.653
and I do think that
he was keenly aware

34:49.655 --> 34:51.455
of having failed you,

34:51.457 --> 34:52.722
but suicide...
(sighs)

34:52.724 --> 34:55.425
...that is such
a shameful way to go...

34:55.427 --> 34:57.294
and a mortal sin.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.628
I mean, you could push

34:58.630 --> 35:01.565
for an inquiry,
but then Martel's end

35:01.567 --> 35:03.100
will be discussed more broadly.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.868
I don't think the Guises
will like that.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.136
Fine.

35:06.138 --> 35:07.771
There's no point in arguing.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.639
As a corpse,
he's hardly a viable husband

35:09.641 --> 35:10.740
or a Catholic presence.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.343
But France does need one.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.212
A Catholic presence,
I mean.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.647
Someone to counsel
the young king and reassure

35:17.649 --> 35:19.249
the Vatican that
Rome has the right

35:19.251 --> 35:20.283
dynastic line
on the throne.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.220
Popes can
displace kings...

35:23.222 --> 35:24.488
but I don't have
to tell you that.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.223
Yet you do.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.159
So, you'll be staying.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.561
Indefinitely.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.267
(door closes)

35:37.269 --> 35:39.302
And Spain steps in.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.671
KNOX:
<i> You were supposed to kill</i>

35:41.673 --> 35:44.274
the entire clan,
not just their leader.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.909
Now you've
strengthened Mary's hand.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.410
She gave me no choice.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.778
I couldn't publicly
refuse the queen.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.147
Well, you should
have found a way.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.548
Oh, but you didn't.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.283
You threw your lot in
with Mary and now God

35:53.285 --> 35:54.684
will take you
down with her.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.254
I will spread the word
with my followers

35:57.256 --> 35:59.256
that you betrayed us,

35:59.258 --> 36:02.159
that you're a Catholic
sympathizer, a weak...

36:02.161 --> 36:04.261
Do not threaten me.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.296
I am half brother
to the queen.

36:06.298 --> 36:08.598
My family has royal
blood in our veins.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.469
The people believe that
God chose us to rule,

36:12.471 --> 36:15.472
while you merely
spout His teachings.

36:15.474 --> 36:19.309
That is true power.

36:19.311 --> 36:23.947
Power that a commoner
like you will never have.

36:28.954 --> 36:31.288
Keira.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.722
Where's my son?
Where's Darnley?

36:32.724 --> 36:35.492
He's not here, Lady Lennox.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.761
But he was,
from the looks of it.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.963
I don't know why
you two continue

36:39.965 --> 36:41.865
to pursue this dangerous
little love affair.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.334
You have no future
and you know it.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.303
I have defied Elizabeth

36:46.305 --> 36:48.338
to secure a crown for my son,

36:48.340 --> 36:51.341
and nothing is going to stand
in my way, certainly not you.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.710
Now, Queen Mary
has expressed interest

36:53.712 --> 36:55.245
in Darnley and
I need to get him

36:55.247 --> 36:56.713
to Scotland,
and he must leave

36:56.715 --> 36:58.715
before Elizabeth finds him.

36:58.717 --> 37:03.520
So, where... is... Darnley?

37:03.522 --> 37:04.921
He got a letter from the queen.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.324
Which queen?

37:07.326 --> 37:08.425
Mary writes to me.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.563
Not Elizabeth-- I have
intercepted all of her letters.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.300
Apparently not all.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.610
Your Majesty,

37:26.612 --> 37:28.011
may I present

37:28.013 --> 37:29.746
the honorable Lord Darnley.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.514
(sighs)

37:34.386 --> 37:36.987
Queen Elizabeth.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.025
I hear you've
been looking for me.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.927
You're a difficult man to find.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.630
I thought you'd be halfway
to Scotland by now,

37:46.632 --> 37:48.398
on your way to marrying
my cousin.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.600
I know why you want to prevent
that wedding.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.736
You fear the tides of power

37:52.738 --> 37:53.803
will turn against you.

37:53.805 --> 37:54.871
With all my Catholic

37:54.873 --> 37:56.039
allies here in England,

37:56.041 --> 37:58.275
I am the foothold Mary needs

37:58.277 --> 38:00.277
to start a revolution

38:00.279 --> 38:01.544
and dethrone you...

38:01.546 --> 38:03.546
hypothetically.

38:03.548 --> 38:07.284
So, you've come to<i> my</i> court
to bargain.

38:07.286 --> 38:08.551
Very well.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.453
What do you want?

38:10.455 --> 38:12.622
I'm in love with a woman
I can't have.

38:12.624 --> 38:15.458
She is promised to a suitor
of a powerful family.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.595
As queen, you can break
their engagement.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.430
That sounds expensive.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.898
If you do this for me,

38:21.900 --> 38:25.302
I will stay here in England
with the woman I love.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.437
Queen Mary and I
will never meet.

38:27.439 --> 38:31.308
And without me, Mary Stuart
will be powerless against you.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.880
How are you feeling?

38:36.882 --> 38:40.583
It's good to be home...
and to be unmarried.

38:40.585 --> 38:43.386
Yes, the single life is a bit
rougher here than I remembered.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.055
A letter arrived for you.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.856
It's from Gideon.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.464
Mary.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.999
You sent for me?

38:57.002 --> 38:58.468
I received intelligence

38:58.470 --> 38:59.803
from England today.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.339
John Knox was behind

39:02.341 --> 39:03.606
the assassination attempt

39:03.608 --> 39:04.874
on Elizabeth.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.409
He forged a letter
in my handwriting

39:06.411 --> 39:07.644
ordering Lola
to kill Elizabeth.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.579
Lola thought she was

39:09.581 --> 39:10.714
just following my command

39:10.716 --> 39:11.981
and she died for it.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.817
Mary, I...

39:15.554 --> 39:17.587
I'm so sorry.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.655
I can't keep blaming

39:18.657 --> 39:20.090
my cousin for this.

39:20.092 --> 39:21.825
(sighs)
I would've done the same.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.760
As it is,
because of who we are,

39:23.762 --> 39:24.761
it doesn't make
a difference.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.697
We are still two queens

39:27.699 --> 39:30.600
and there is only
one English throne.

39:33.004 --> 39:35.572
Did you know about Knox?

39:35.574 --> 39:38.408
Mary, I'm on your side.

39:38.410 --> 39:40.777
I am asking if you knew.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.980
I knew... after the fact.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.815
And you did nothing.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.884
You said nothing.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.086
You had just achieved peace
with the Protestants.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.654
If you'd retaliated
against Knox...

39:51.656 --> 39:53.423
You didn't trust my judgment.
I do now.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.592
The way you handled Clan
Gordon proved to me that...

39:55.594 --> 39:57.494
I don't have
to prove myself to you.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.595
I am queen!

39:59.664 --> 40:01.931
And your job is to serve me!

40:01.933 --> 40:04.401
Instead you serve
a Protestant agenda.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.735
Knox's agenda.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.170
You tried to help wipe out

40:07.172 --> 40:08.705
my Catholic supporters,

40:08.707 --> 40:10.073
or was that Knox's idea, too?

40:10.075 --> 40:11.775
I defied Knox and severed

40:11.777 --> 40:13.009
all ties with him.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.978
I have no other side but yours.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.613
You made sure of that.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.781
Perhaps.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.649
But you have a long road

40:19.651 --> 40:21.184
before I trust you again.

40:29.161 --> 40:31.528
That Highland lord was right.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.063
I have Protestant enemies
everywhere.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.032
If I am to survive
the battles to come,

40:36.034 --> 40:39.202
I will need Catholic allies.

40:39.204 --> 40:40.804
You're going to marry Darnley.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.006
Mary, I told you,

40:43.008 --> 40:44.007
that's risking your throne.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.642
My throne will always

40:45.644 --> 40:46.910
be at risk.

40:48.180 --> 40:51.581
I need power.

40:51.583 --> 40:54.050
And I must do whatever
it takes to get it.

40:54.052 --> 40:58.121
I need a husband that Rome
and Catholics all over the world

40:58.123 --> 40:59.889
will stand behind.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.892
And that husband
is Lord Darnley.

41:02.894 --> 41:04.961
