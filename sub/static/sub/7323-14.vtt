WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.305
(Meredith) ONE OF
THE HARDEST LESSONS AS A DOCTOR

00:04.305 --> 00:06.307
IS LEARNING TO PRIORITIZE.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.638
TRUCK.

00:07.638 --> 00:09.040
CABIN.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.381
SPOON.

00:10.381 --> 00:12.513
(woman) TRUCK.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.086
CABIN.

00:15.086 --> 00:16.317
SPOON. (exhales)

00:16.317 --> 00:18.649
VERY GOOD.

00:18.649 --> 00:22.323
WE'RE TRAINED TO DO ALL WE CAN
TO SAVE LIFE AND LIMB.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.126
BUT IF CUTTING OF A LIMB
MEANS SAVING A LIFE,

00:25.126 --> 00:28.159
WE LEARN TO DO IT
WITHOUT HESITATION.
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,

00:28.159 --> 00:30.030
I ASKED YOU
TO REMEMBER THREE WORDS.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.032
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT THEY WERE?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.634
TRUCK.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.406
CABIN.

00:35.406 --> 00:37.108
SPOON.

00:37.108 --> 00:39.710
THE THREE WORDS
I ASKED YOU TO REMEMBER,

00:39.710 --> 00:41.372
WHAT WERE THEY?

00:41.372 --> 00:43.374
IT'S NOT AN EASY LESSON
TO LEARN,

00:43.374 --> 00:46.077
AND IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN
TO ONE QUESTION...
YES. UM...

00:46.077 --> 00:47.718
WHAT ARE THE STAKES?

00:47.718 --> 00:50.081
TRUCK.

00:50.081 --> 00:52.423
CABIN?

00:52.423 --> 00:54.755
(man) ♪ I DON'T WANT THE SAME,
SO I GUESS I BETTER GO ♪

00:54.755 --> 00:58.159
AND THE THIRD WORD?
WHAT DO WE STAND
TO GAIN OR LOSE?

00:58.159 --> 01:00.661
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE'RE JUST GAMBLERS

01:00.661 --> 01:02.233
TRYING NOT TO BET THE FARM.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.165
SPOON.
SPOON.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.497
SPOON.
EXCELLENT.

01:06.497 --> 01:08.739
♪ I STILL THINK ♪

01:08.739 --> 01:10.601
♪ THAT I JUST MIGHT ♪

01:10.601 --> 01:11.772
CHIEF.

01:11.772 --> 01:15.206
YOU PAGED? HEY.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.648
HOW'S IT GOING?
WELL, THE WORD "SPOON"

01:17.648 --> 01:19.650
HAS CEASED TO HAVE
ANY MEANING FOR ME,

01:19.650 --> 01:21.812
BUT I'M THROUGH
THE FIRST TEST SET.

01:21.812 --> 01:24.585
I HAVE A FEW MORE CONSULTS
TODAY, BUT WHAT'S UP?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.086
MEREDITH...

01:26.086 --> 01:29.160
I WOULD LIKE TO INITIATE
A CLINICAL TRIAL.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.322
ONE THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT
MAJOR ADVANCEMENT

01:31.322 --> 01:34.525
IN THE FIGHT
TO CURE TYPE 1 DIABETES.

01:34.525 --> 01:36.096
WOW.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.270
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO PARTICIPATE.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.373
BUT I AM
ON DEREK'S ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL,

01:42.373 --> 01:44.605
SO I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO BOTH.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.138
JUST LISTEN.

01:47.138 --> 01:49.480
THE BASIS OF THIS TRIAL WAS
SOMETHING THAT I FOUND IN HERE.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.182
IN MY MOTHER'S JOURNALS?

01:51.182 --> 01:54.114
YES. SHE WAS WORKING ON
ISLET CELL TRANSPLANTATION

01:54.114 --> 01:55.786
WHEN SHE BECAME ILL,

01:55.786 --> 01:57.788
TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE NEED

01:57.788 --> 02:00.251
FOR ANTI-REJECTION MEDS
ALTOGETHER.

02:00.251 --> 02:03.123
W-WITH HER NOTES, DRUGS,
AND NEW TECHNOLOGY,

02:03.123 --> 02:05.125
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN'T TAKE THIS

02:05.125 --> 02:07.127
THE REST OF THE WAY
DOWN THE FIELD.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.160
WE?

02:09.160 --> 02:10.561
WELL,
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S WORK.

02:10.561 --> 02:12.563
I WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT
MOVING FORWARD

02:12.563 --> 02:14.605
IF YOU WEREN'T A PART OF IT.

02:14.605 --> 02:16.907
(Derek) YOU SHOULD
LOOK AT THEM BOTH.

02:16.907 --> 02:20.211
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

02:20.211 --> 02:23.774
♪ OOH, OOH, OOH ♪

02:23.774 --> 02:26.317
IT'S YOUR BIRTHRIGHT,
MEREDITH.

02:26.317 --> 02:35.626
IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S LEGACY
TO YOU.

02:35.626 --> 02:37.428
WHAT IS IT?

02:37.428 --> 02:39.930
IT'S A KALE
AND APPLE JUICE SMOOTHIE.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.932
IT'S TIME TO THINK LESS
ABOUT YOUR CRAVINGS

02:41.932 --> 02:45.266
AND MORE ABOUT FILLING THAT BABY
WITH NUTRIENTS, WHICH THAT HAS.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.268
IT ALSO HAS CHUNKS.
I DON'T DRINK CHUNKS.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.570
I WANT MY COFFEE.
MARK, TELL THE WOMAN.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.273
I'M ALLOWED TO DRINK ONE CUP
OF REGULAR COFFEE.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.275
SURE YOU ARE.
OH, W-WAIT, MARK.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.947
ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE
ARE STUDIES THAT LINK CAFFEINE

02:56.947 --> 02:59.510
WITH PRETERM LABOR, LOW BIRTH
WEIGHT, OTHER BIRTH DEFECTS?

02:59.510 --> 03:02.383
THAT GOO LOOKS GREAT.
I SAY YOU STICK WITH THE GOO.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.585
OKAY, YOU TWO
CAN'T JUST DICTATE

03:04.585 --> 03:07.218
WHAT I'M ALLOWED
TO EAT AND DRINK.
NOBODY'S DICTATING ANYTHING.

03:07.218 --> 03:10.361
BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT NOW,
SO THINGS HAVE TO BE DIFFERENT.

03:10.361 --> 03:13.394
(sighs)
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EAT BETTER
AND TAKE IT EASIER AT WORK.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.196
AND WELL, IF IT HELPS,
WE'LL GIVE UP CAFFEINE, TOO.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.199
THAT HELPS NO ONE.
WELL, HOW ABOUT
WE PUT IT TO A VOTE?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.373
ALL IN FAVOR OF CALLIE DRINKING
COFFEE, RAISE YOUR HAND.

03:22.373 --> 03:26.377
ALL IN FAVOR OF THE GOO.

03:26.377 --> 03:28.339
GOO IT IS.

03:29.940 --> 03:31.242
(sniffs)

03:31.242 --> 03:34.245
(groans)

03:34.245 --> 03:35.346
(gags)

03:35.346 --> 03:36.887
MM.
(Meredith) IT'S HORRIBLE.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.889
IT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF HORRIBLE.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.292
(sighs) ALZHEIMER'S
OR DIABETES?

03:41.292 --> 03:43.794
IF YOU CONTINUE TO WHINE
ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T DECIDE

03:43.794 --> 03:45.526
WHICH GROUNDBREAKING
MEDICAL ADVANCEMENT

03:45.526 --> 03:48.259
TO PUT YOUR NAME ON,
I'LL PUNCH YOU IN THE EAR.

03:48.259 --> 03:51.231
(laughs)
WELL, MY NAME'S ALREADY
ON ONE OF THEM,

03:51.231 --> 03:54.305
ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF.
I MEAN, DIABETES--
AFFECTS 240 MILLION PEOPLE
WORLDWIDE.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.937
AND ALZHEIMER'S--
IS THE SEVENTH LEADING
CAUSE OF DEATH.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.309
(sighs)

03:58.309 --> 03:59.910
IT'S "SOPHIE'S CHOICE."

03:59.910 --> 04:02.273
IT'S "SOPHIE'S CHOICE."
UH-HUH.

04:02.273 --> 04:04.815
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MOVIE.
OH, YOU SHOULD.
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.

04:04.815 --> 04:07.518
(Meredith and Cristina laugh)
GREYS, OKAY, HOW LONG
HAS YOUR FATHER

04:07.518 --> 04:09.720
BEEN HAVING ABDOMINAL PAIN?
ABDOMINAL PAIN?

04:09.720 --> 04:11.882
IT SOUNDS LIKE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

04:11.882 --> 04:14.885
THATCHER GREY IS NOT AN EASY MAN
TO GET INFORMATION FROM.
OUR--OUR FATHER'S HERE
IN THE HOSPITAL?

04:14.885 --> 04:16.887
YEAH, I ADMITTED HIM
AN HOUR AGO.

04:16.887 --> 04:19.490
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS COMING?
(Lexie mutters)

04:19.490 --> 04:20.991
WELL,
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT'S WRONG?

04:20.991 --> 04:23.364
COULD IT BE RELATED
TO THE LIVER TRANSPLANT?

04:23.364 --> 04:26.297
OF COURSE. HE'S REJECTING IT
BECAUSE IT'S MY LIVER.

04:26.297 --> 04:29.500
OKAY, LOOK, JUST DO ME A FAVOR,
GO TAKE A BLOOD SAMPLE,

04:29.500 --> 04:32.343
AND TRY TO GET SOME MORE
INFORMATION OUT OF HIM.

04:32.343 --> 04:34.575
I-I NEED SOMEONE
WHO SPEAKS GREY.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.307
YEAH.

04:36.307 --> 04:38.749
HEY, STRANGER.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.484
MEREDITH HAS TWO
GROUNDBREAKING CLINICAL TRIALS,

04:43.484 --> 04:45.356
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY.

04:45.356 --> 04:47.658
OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE A HUSBAND
THAT LOVES YOU.

04:47.658 --> 04:49.360
YEAH, SO DOES SHE.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.393
THEN... THEN I GUESS
YOU'RE SCREWED.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.069
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

05:00.571 --> 05:03.073
(telephone rings)

05:03.073 --> 05:05.576
(woman) HELLO, NICU.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.641
I THOUGHT I KNEW
ALL THE NURSES ON THIS FLOOR.

05:10.641 --> 05:13.784
HOW DID I MISS YOU?
I GUESS I'M JUST LUCKY
THAT WAY.

05:13.784 --> 05:15.346
I'M ALEX KAREV.

05:15.346 --> 05:16.787
NEAT.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.089
AND YOU ARE?

05:19.089 --> 05:20.791
NOT TELLING YOU MY NAME.

05:20.791 --> 05:22.953
ANY REASON WHY NOT?

05:22.953 --> 05:25.496
BECAUSE, UH,
I DON'T WANT TO.
OKAY.

05:25.496 --> 05:27.998
THEN HOW ABOUT YOU PASS ME
ONE OF THOSE CHARTS?

05:27.998 --> 05:31.331
I HEAR THERE'S A TURNIP
IN THE CABBAGE PATCH.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.833
A TURNIP?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.665
GORKED. BRAIN-DEAD.

05:34.665 --> 05:37.708
(chuckles)
DR. ROBBINS AND I HAVE A BABY
WITH A HYPOPLASTIC LEFT HEART.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.470
THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR--

05:39.470 --> 05:43.374
SUGGESTED THE, UH, TURNIP
AS A POTENTIAL DONOR.

05:43.374 --> 05:45.416
YEAH.
UH-HUH.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.418
WELL, NOW YOU DO
GET TO KNOW MY NAME.

05:47.418 --> 05:50.350
I'M DR. LUCY FIELDS.
I DELIVERED THAT GORKED BABY.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.023
SO, UH,
THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.

05:53.023 --> 05:54.855
I'LL TALK TO
THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.857
BUT NOW YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.989
COME ON. THERE'S NO REASON
TO OVERREACT.

05:58.989 --> 06:00.561
REALLY?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.563
WELL, NOW YOU'RE BARRED
FROM THE NICU.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.695
HOW'S THAT FOR OVERREACTING?

06:04.695 --> 06:06.797
(laughs) YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

06:06.797 --> 06:09.440
WANT TO FIND OUT?

06:14.905 --> 06:17.377
(women speak indistinctly)

06:17.377 --> 06:19.550
(keyboard keys clicking)
(inhales sharply)

06:19.550 --> 06:21.552
OH, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

06:21.552 --> 06:23.554
YOU REALLY
DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

06:23.554 --> 06:25.656
LET ME GET THAT FOR YOU,
DR. TORRES.

06:25.656 --> 06:27.818
OKAY, RANDY SHOUSE, 23.

06:27.818 --> 06:29.820
MULTIPLE INJURIES AFTER SLAMMING
INTO A BRICK WALL.

06:29.820 --> 06:31.422
H-HOW DID YOU--

06:31.422 --> 06:34.094
IDIOT AND HIS IDIOT BUDDIES
BUILT A HUMAN SLINGSHOT.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.096
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HIT THE WALL.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.098
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FLY
OVER THE HOUSE

06:38.098 --> 06:40.901
AND LA-LAND IN THE POOL.
BUT WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.434
SO THEY COULD FILM IT,
PUT IT ON THE INTERNET,

06:43.434 --> 06:45.576
AND SHOW THE WORLD JUST HOW
STUPID THEY ACTUALLY ARE.

06:45.576 --> 06:46.637
DUDE.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.439
OW! (grunts)

06:48.439 --> 06:50.781
DID YOU GET THAT?

06:50.781 --> 06:53.113
YEAH, BUDDY.
(laughs) YEAH.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.145
BUT WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S HILARIOUS,
THAT'S WHY.

06:55.145 --> 06:58.118
OKAY, RANDY, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOME KIND OF AWESOME SLINGSHOT,

06:58.118 --> 07:00.591
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'VE DISLOCATED BOTH HIPS.

07:00.591 --> 07:04.194
NOW I'M GONNA NEED TO GET
SOME X-RAYS.
I'M ON IT!

07:04.194 --> 07:05.856
WOW. SHE'S PERKY.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.858
MM-HMM. BETTER THAN STUPID
WITH A DEATH WISH.

07:07.858 --> 07:09.760
(Lexie) YOU'RE SICK ENOUGH

07:09.760 --> 07:12.432
THAT YOU NEED
TO COME INTO THE HOSPITAL,

07:12.432 --> 07:14.935
AND YOU DON'T EVEN CALL ME?
THE PAIN COMES AND GOES.
I DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY--

07:14.935 --> 07:16.937
SO YOU THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD JUST SNEAK IN

07:16.937 --> 07:18.839
AND JUST QUIETLY REJECT
MEREDITH'S LIVER,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.911
NOT EVEN MAKE A FUSS?
JUST C-CALM DOWN, PLEASE.

07:20.911 --> 07:23.614
(laughs) OH, NO. I AM CALM.
I AM SO CALM.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.676
I'M LIKE THE CALMEST ONE.
OKAY, GOOD.

07:25.676 --> 07:29.449
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
I GO TO A.A.
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.753
YES, THAT I KNOW.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.125
NO, I KNOW YOU KNOW,
BUT SOMETIMES,

07:35.125 --> 07:37.127
YOU HAVE TO GET UP
IN FRONT OF THE GROUP

07:37.127 --> 07:39.930
AND YOU SAY YOUR PIECE,
AND THEN PEOPLE SOMETIMES

07:39.930 --> 07:41.692
COME UP TO YOU AFTERWARDS
AND SAY

07:41.692 --> 07:43.694
THAT THEY LIKE WHAT YOU SAID,

07:43.694 --> 07:46.637
AND THEN MAYBE YOU GO TO COFFEE
WITH THEM AFTERWARD.
YEAH, LIKE A SPONSOR?

07:46.637 --> 07:49.600
NO, NOT A SPONSOR.
OH, HOW DO I--
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
SORRY. I GOT TURNED AROUND,

07:49.600 --> 07:52.102
AND THEN I ENDED UP
BACK IN THE LOBBY. HEY.
N-NO, NO.

07:52.102 --> 07:54.575
MM. NO, NO, NO, NO.
OH. OH, GOD. WHAT?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.477
I'M SORRY.
ARE--ARE YOU IN PAIN?

07:57.477 --> 07:58.809
(Thatcher) UH, YEAH.

07:58.809 --> 08:01.552
NOT A SPONSOR.

08:01.552 --> 08:05.115
(siren wailing)

08:05.115 --> 08:07.558
(snaps)

08:14.895 --> 08:16.597
I AM SO SORRY.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.699
THIS WAS NOT THE WAY
THAT I WANTED TO MEET YOU.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.572
WELL, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WAS A YOU TO MEET.

08:21.572 --> 08:24.605
I KNOW. I-I'M SORRY. I--
OKAY, MR. GREY--OH, HELLO.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.608
DR. BAILEY,
THIS IS... DANIELLE.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.580
DANI. HI.
YES, DANI.

08:29.580 --> 08:32.613
THAT'S MY FATHER'S GIRLFRIEND,
WHOM I'VE JUST MET JUST NOW.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.914
(car horn honks)

08:33.914 --> 08:35.616
OH, I SEE.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.919
UM, NICE TO MEET YOU, DANI.
I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS,

08:38.919 --> 08:41.992
AND THEN I WILL LET YOU
GET BACK TO ALL OF THIS.

08:41.992 --> 08:44.995
DO YOU REALLY THINK I COULD BE
REJECTING THIS LIVER?

08:44.995 --> 08:47.898
BECAUSE DANI HAS BEEN AMAZING
HELPING ME TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

08:47.898 --> 08:49.700
AND I'M CONSTANTLY
TAKING PILLS.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.531
HIS ANTI-REJECTION MEDS.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.103
NOT, LIKE, SPEED
OR ANYTHING.

08:53.103 --> 08:55.666
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE
INAPPROPRIATE.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.268
UM, WHEN DID THE PAIN START?

08:58.268 --> 09:00.270
12 DAYS AGO.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.613
SH-SHE'S GOOD WITH DETAILS.

09:02.613 --> 09:04.975
ANY FEVERS OR CHANGES
IN YOUR URINE OR STOOL?

09:04.975 --> 09:06.677
(chuckles)

09:06.677 --> 09:08.849
NO FEVERS.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.982
BUT THERE WAS
A... PAIN INCIDENT,

09:11.982 --> 09:13.954
UH, LAST WEEK, THURSDAY.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.556
A-ACTUALLY, YOU MIGHT NOT
WANT TO HEAR THIS PART.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.659
I'M A DOCTOR.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.561
ALL RIGHT.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.563
WELL,
WE WERE BEING INTIMATE...

09:23.563 --> 09:26.266
OH, J--NO.
AND I WAS ON TOP--

09:26.266 --> 09:28.769
OH, OH, OKAY.
(mutters)

09:28.769 --> 09:31.341

09:31.341 --> 09:33.043
GO ON.

09:33.043 --> 09:34.705

09:34.705 --> 09:36.576
DR. AVERY.
OH.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.579
IT'S ABOUT TIME
I HAD YOU ON MY SERVICE.
THANK YOU, DR. SLOAN.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.582
I GOTTA SAY, I REALLY THINK
I HAVE THE HANDS FOR PLASTICS.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.585
OH, FORGET ABOUT YOUR HANDS.
LOOK AT THOSE CHEEKBONES.
SIR?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.888
YOU'RE GENETICALLY BLESSED.
DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T NOTICED.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.890
AND SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE, I CAN SAY THAT

09:49.890 --> 09:51.892
THAT WILL ONLY HELP YOU
IN PLASTICS.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.894
THAT FACE? BETTER THAN
A HUNDRED BILLBOARDS, MY MAN.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.727
ALL RIGHT, DR. SLOAN,
I REALLY DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

09:56.727 --> 09:58.869
BEING JUDGED OR PRAISED
BASED ON MY LOOKS.

09:58.869 --> 10:01.201
OH, POOR MR. GREEN EYES.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.675
LET'S NOT PRETEND
BEING BEAUTIFUL'S A BURDEN.

10:04.675 --> 10:08.238
NOW COME ON. MRS. JOHNSON'S NOSE
ISN'T GONNA FIX ITSELF.

10:08.238 --> 10:11.742
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SPARKLE?

10:11.742 --> 10:13.744
(elevator bell dings)

10:13.744 --> 10:16.717
THERE IT IS.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.719
HIP DISLOCATION,
FRACTURES OF HIS FEMUR,

10:18.719 --> 10:20.620
RADIUS, RIBS, AND METACARPALS.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.922
OKAY.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.055
SHOULD WE JUST, UH, GO AHEAD
AND REDUCE THOSE HIPS?

10:25.055 --> 10:27.698
KEPNER, I NEED YOU
TO SPEAK DIFFERENTLY.

10:27.698 --> 10:30.160
I'M SORRY?
IT'S YOUR VOICE.
IT'S A LITTLE--

10:30.160 --> 10:32.162
JUST SPEAK DIFFERENTLY.

10:33.804 --> 10:35.806
LIKE WITH AN ACCENT OR--
NEVER MIND.

10:35.806 --> 10:38.809
YOU KNOW, HOW ABOUT YOU GET ME
A MUFFIN FROM THE CAFETERIA?

10:38.809 --> 10:41.912
GET ME THE SUGARIEST KIND
YOU CAN FIND, AND SOME COFFEE.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.714
WAIT. NO.

10:43.714 --> 10:46.717
DAMN IT. NO COFFEE.

10:46.717 --> 10:49.649
OKAY.
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? YES.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.752
COFFEE. PLEASE.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.853
GREAT.

10:52.853 --> 10:56.787
CRAP! NO. N-N-NO COFFEE.
YOU SURE?

10:56.787 --> 10:59.760
NO, NO COFFEE. JUST...
JUST--JUST GO.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.161
OKAY.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.136
(blows air)

11:06.136 --> 11:08.939
UH, DID YOU STILL WANT
THE MUFFIN?
YES.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.706
OKAY, YES, I KNOW THAT I'M NOT
DR. BAILEY, BUT HE'S MY FATHER,

11:15.706 --> 11:17.708
AND I REALLY NEED
HIS LAB RESULTS.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.009
SORRY, I CAN'T DO IT.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.381
OKAY, WELL, THEN MAYBE I'LL JUST
LET YOUR SUPERVISOR KNOW THAT

11:21.381 --> 11:23.353
I'VE BEEN HIGHLY UNSATISFIED
WITH YOUR SERVICE TODAY.

11:23.353 --> 11:25.856
THIS ISN'T THE MALL.
WE DON'T HAVE COMMENT CARDS.

11:25.856 --> 11:27.157
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

11:27.157 --> 11:30.690
HEY. YOU OKAY?
YOU NEED ME TO TALK TO HIM?
MARK, NO.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.364
MY DAY HAS BEEN TOO MESSED UP
TO HAVE YOU IN IT, TOO.

11:34.364 --> 11:37.768
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:37.768 --> 11:40.771
(indistinct conversations)

11:43.774 --> 11:46.737
(speaking inaudibly)

11:46.737 --> 11:48.879
SON OF A BITCH.

11:48.879 --> 11:50.881
(Teddy)
WE KNOW WITHOUT A DOUBT

11:50.881 --> 11:52.843
THAT THIS HEART
IS A VIABLE OPTION.

11:52.843 --> 11:55.345
HOW? HOW DO WE KNOW
THAT THIS IS A GOOD MATCH?

11:55.345 --> 11:57.487
WELL, BABIES UNDER A YEAR
HAVEN'T DEVELOPED

11:57.487 --> 11:59.750
AN IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT WILL
REJECT THE NEW ORGAN.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.752
IT MAKES MATCHING
A LOT EASIER.

12:01.752 --> 12:05.025
BUT WE'RE STILL FOUR WEEKS
AWAY FROM THE DUE DATE.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.998
OUR O.B. ISN'T EVEN
IN TOWN RIGHT NOW.

12:07.998 --> 12:09.830
I'M COVERING
FOR DR. NAPOLITANO.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.131
I'VE GOT HER BLESSING

12:11.131 --> 12:13.103
TO GO AHEAD
AND DO THE C-SECTION TODAY.

12:13.103 --> 12:16.837
TODAY? T--THAT'S REALLY--
COLIN, TIME'S AN ISSUE HERE.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.870
WE NEED TO INFORM THE TRANSPLANT
BOARD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

12:19.870 --> 12:21.471
IF YOU WANT THIS HEART.

12:21.471 --> 12:23.974
OTHERWISE, IT'S GONNA GO
TO ANOTHER FAMILY.
WHOA. OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:23.974 --> 12:26.516
THERE ARE A LOT OF DOCTORS
IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.819
SO WHY DON'T WE GIVE
THE COOKES SOME SPACE?

12:28.819 --> 12:30.781
YOU CAN HAVE
ONE OF THE NURSES PAGE US

12:30.781 --> 12:32.522
WHEN YOU'VE MADE A DECISION.

12:37.287 --> 12:40.791
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHY DIDN'T YOU PAGE ME?

12:40.791 --> 12:42.032
TURNIP, KAREV?

12:42.032 --> 12:43.493
YOU TATTLED ON ME?

12:43.493 --> 12:45.495
YOU'RE SO OFF THIS CASE.

12:45.495 --> 12:48.799
SERIOUSLY? I HAVE SAID
WAY WORSE STUFF THAN THAT.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.100
YEAH, NOT HELPING.

12:52.002 --> 12:54.945
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

12:54.945 --> 12:57.848
(scoffs)

13:06.456 --> 13:08.088
(suction gurgling)

13:08.088 --> 13:10.560
AVERY, YOU WANT TO GIVE
THE OSTEOTOMIES A SHOT?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.562
YES, SIR.

13:12.562 --> 13:15.165
MALLET, PLEASE.

13:15.165 --> 13:18.098
YOU LIVE WITH
LEXIE GREY NOW, RIGHT?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.930
HOW'S SHE DOING THESE DAYS?

13:19.930 --> 13:21.231
OKAY, I GUESS.

13:21.231 --> 13:24.374
OKAY?
SHE HASN'T SEEMED UPSET?

13:24.374 --> 13:26.877
SHE KIND OF CRIES SOMETIMES,
BUT SHE SEEMS OKAY.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.880
NOW ARE YOU GONNA STRIP
THE, UH, LATERAL CARTILAGE HERE?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.142
CRYING SEEMS FINE?

13:32.142 --> 13:34.144
SHE'S A GIRL.
GIRLS CRY.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.847
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S BEEN UPSET ABOUT?

13:36.847 --> 13:39.219
NOT REALLY
ANY OF MY BUSINESS.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.390
(crackles)

13:40.390 --> 13:42.052
YEAH.

13:42.052 --> 13:43.894

NEXT, I FINISH UP HERE

13:43.894 --> 13:46.826
WHILE YOU GO FIND OUT
WHAT'S UP WITH LEXIE.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.428
SORRY?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.400
SHE'S UPSET.
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHY.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.402
YOU WANT TO BE ON MY SERVICE,
THEN SERVE.

13:52.402 --> 13:54.404
USE THAT AVERY SPARKLE.
DR. SLOAN--

13:54.404 --> 13:57.237
I'M GONNA DO A COUPLE MORE
RHINOPLASTIES THIS AFTERNOON.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.240
YOU DO ME THIS SOLID,
AND I JUST MIGHT BE PERSUADED

14:00.240 --> 14:02.412

TAKE THE LEAD ON ONE.

14:02.412 --> 14:04.544

14:04.544 --> 14:06.576
OKAY.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.180

14:11.952 --> 14:14.184
OH, YEAH.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.887
(whistles)
OH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:16.887 --> 14:20.160
UH... I LOOKED IT UP,

14:20.160 --> 14:23.894
AND THOSE, UH, CAFFEINE STUDIES
SHOWED BIRTH DEFECTS IN RATS,

14:23.894 --> 14:25.896
AND I'M NOT A RAT, SO...

14:25.896 --> 14:28.168
TELL HER I'M NOT A RAT.
WELL, LET HER HAVE--

14:28.168 --> 14:31.171
HEY, WE TOOK A VOTE.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.282
UGH.
(pager beeps)

18:32.282 --> 18:34.244
UH, TINY BABY HEART TIME.

18:34.244 --> 18:36.115
CAREFUL WHEN YOU
GO IN THERE, MER.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.588
YOU TANGLE
WITH ONE HELLS ANGEL,

18:38.588 --> 18:40.590
YOU TANGLE
WITH THE WHOLE GANG.

18:40.590 --> 18:42.452
(elevator bell dings)

18:42.452 --> 18:44.194
OKAY.

18:44.194 --> 18:47.297
YOU COMING?
I'M NOT GOING IN THERE AGAIN.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.128
SERIOUSLY, LEXIE?
I CAN'T.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.201
WELL, THEN I'M GOING BACK
TO WORK.
MEREDITH--

18:51.201 --> 18:53.132
(Thatcher) OW! OOH! UH!

18:53.132 --> 18:54.634
GAH!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.135
OH, OH.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.738
ALL RIGHT.
HEY, UH, MOVE, PLEASE.
(speaks indistinctly)

18:58.738 --> 19:01.271
I'M GONNA PAGE BAILEY.
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME.

19:01.271 --> 19:03.313
ALL RIGHT, DAD,
IS IT THE SAME PAIN?
(groaning)

19:03.313 --> 19:05.875
WHERE--WHERE DOES IT HURT?
I'M TELLING YOU,
I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.318
OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY.
WILL YOU PLEASE LET HIM TALK?
HE CAN'T TALK.

19:08.318 --> 19:10.650
NO, IT'S HERE. OW!
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
JUST BACK UP, PLEASE.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.183
BABY, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
OKAY? I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M SORRY.

19:13.183 --> 19:15.154
BACK UP.
I NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.658
PLEASE JUST TELL ME
WHAT I CAN DO.
OKAY, BACK THE HELL UP
RIGHT NOW!

19:18.658 --> 19:22.262
(moans) OH, GOD. OH.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, DAD.

19:31.341 --> 19:35.205
THE BLOOD TESTS INDICATE
THAT YOUR LIVER IS FINE.

19:35.205 --> 19:39.178
IS THERE ANYTHING AT ALL
THAT YOU'VE LEFT OUT?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.351
IT'S WHEN HE PEES.

19:41.351 --> 19:44.354
UH, JUST NOW
AND THEN LAST THURSDAY,

19:44.354 --> 19:47.186
WE HAD MEXICAN FOOD,
AND HE DRANK ALL THIS WATER

19:47.186 --> 19:48.888
BECAUSE IT WAS SPICY,

19:48.888 --> 19:51.721
AND HE WENT TO THE BATHROOM
AS SOON AS WE GOT HOME.

19:51.721 --> 19:54.424
I WAS FREAKED OUT WHEN HE
SCREAMED LATER DURING THE SEX,

19:54.424 --> 19:57.367
I DIDN'T EVEN CONNECT IT.
UH, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
GOOD. THAT HELPS.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.869
SO WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT COULD BE?
WELL, THAT--

19:59.869 --> 20:02.572
IT COULD BE KIDNEY STONES
OR YOUR PROSTATE.

20:02.572 --> 20:05.305
PROSTATE? ARE YOU SAYING
HE COULD HAVE CANCER? HE--

20:05.305 --> 20:08.278
HE CAN'T HAVE CANCER.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S AN OLD MAN.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.209
OLD MEN GET CANCER.
LEXIE, COME ON.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.742
NO, BUT SEE, IF YOU WERE
A DOCTOR LIKE WE ARE,

20:12.742 --> 20:15.245
YOU'D REALIZE THAT WHEN WE USE
THE WORD "PROSTATE,"

20:15.245 --> 20:17.717
IT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY MEAN CANCER.
DR. GREY--

20:17.717 --> 20:19.389
NO, SEE, FREAKING OUT
AND JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS

20:19.389 --> 20:22.552
LIKE A LITTLE CHILD
ISN'T GONNA DO HIM ANY GOOD.
I AM SCARED, OKAY?

20:22.552 --> 20:25.925
I AM TERRIFIED OVER HERE,
AND I'VE GOT QUESTIONS.

20:25.925 --> 20:28.328
YOU'RE TERRIFIED?
WE'RE HIS FAMILY.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.530
I AM HIS FAMILY, TOO!
NO, YOU'RE NOT HIS FAMILY!

20:30.530 --> 20:32.262
YOU'RE HIS MIDLIFE CRISIS!
LEXIE.

20:32.262 --> 20:35.465
LEXIE, LEXIE. THAT'S ENOUGH.
YOU'RE OUT OF LINE.

20:35.465 --> 20:37.937
NO, Y--FINE.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.709
LEXIE.

20:39.709 --> 20:42.342
LE--

20:42.342 --> 20:45.375
UH, CANCER IS--IS ONE OF
A HUNDRED THINGS IT COULD BE.

20:45.375 --> 20:49.319
DR. BAILEY WILL RUN SOME MORE
TESTS JUST TO RULE IT OUT.

20:49.319 --> 20:52.322
IT'S FAR MORE LIKELY THERE'S
ANOTHER EXPLANATION FOR THIS.
ARE YOU THE DAUGHTER
THAT GAVE HIM THE LIVER?

20:52.322 --> 20:54.284
I AM.

20:54.284 --> 20:57.587
THANK YOU.

20:59.429 --> 21:03.363
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

21:03.363 --> 21:06.366
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE--
SAY IT AGAIN
FOR THE CAMERA.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.369
NO. NO, I DON'T THINK
I WILL.
KEPNER, TALK TO THE CAMERA
SO WE CAN GET TO THE O.R.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.000
IN MY NORMAL VOICE?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.373
OR Y--

21:13.373 --> 21:15.475
(chuckles)

21:15.475 --> 21:16.976
RANDY HAS MULTIPLE FRACTURES.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.679
THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS
ARE HIS HIP DISLOCATIONS.

21:19.679 --> 21:23.683
SO WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THEM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

21:23.683 --> 21:26.416
BEFORE THEY LOOSE BLOOD FLOW.
REDUCE?

21:26.416 --> 21:28.888
UH, POP 'EM BACK INTO PLACE.
(man laughs) OH, MAN.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.391
HOLD ON. LET ME, UH,
LET ME GET UP ON THIS CHAIR

21:31.391 --> 21:34.293
FOR THE WIDE ANGLE.
UH, YEAH. WE'RE NOT GONNA--
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT HERE.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.866
HE HAS TO BE SEDATED,
AND WE HAVE TO FIX HIS FEMUR,

21:36.866 --> 21:39.429
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
DO EVERYTHING IN THE O.R.
WAIT. WHAT IF WE DID
THE HIPS HERE,

21:39.429 --> 21:41.501
YOU KNOW, WHILE I'M AWAKE?

21:41.501 --> 21:43.903
AND THEN I CAN GIVE
THE THUMBS-UP TO THE CAMERA.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.406
UH, YOU'RE REALLY NOT GRASPING
HOW MUCH THIS WILL HURT.

21:46.406 --> 21:49.308
WELL, IT'S FOR THE ART,
DR. TORRES.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.481
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:51.481 --> 21:53.443
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.

21:53.443 --> 21:55.845
DR. HUNT,
I THINK THAT IT'S--

21:55.845 --> 21:58.718
DR. TORRES,
IT IS FOR THE ART.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.320
OH.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.522
OKAY.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.455
(chuckles) OKAY. O-OKAY.
YEAH. OKAY, YEAH.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.457
MARCUS, HOP ON THAT CHAIR.
KEPNER, SPOT HIM.

22:07.457 --> 22:08.758
YEAH, COME ON.
(Owen) OKAY?

22:08.758 --> 22:10.760
ALL RIGHT. SURE.
(Randy grunting)

22:10.760 --> 22:13.463
OKAY. YOU GUYS READY?

22:13.463 --> 22:16.105
OKAY.

22:16.105 --> 22:17.967
AAH! PLEASE STOP! STOP!

22:17.967 --> 22:21.541
STOP! TURN THE CAMERA OFF!
STOP! (crying) OH!

22:21.541 --> 22:24.844
TURN THE CAMERA OFF!
MARCUS, TURN THE CAMERA OFF!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.847
THAT TOTALLY CHEERED ME UP.
WELL, ART HAS THAT EFFECT.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.119
MM.

22:30.119 --> 22:32.482
(surgical team
speaking indistinctly)

22:32.482 --> 22:36.486
(suction gurgling)

22:36.486 --> 22:38.488
(surgical team continues
speaking indistinctly)

22:38.488 --> 22:40.560
LISTEN...

22:40.560 --> 22:42.892
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THE TURNIP THING.

22:42.892 --> 22:44.464
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID IT.

22:44.464 --> 22:47.737
BUT DOCTOR TO DOCTOR,
YOU OVERREACTED.

22:47.737 --> 22:51.040
(scoffs)
THAT'S MY PATIENT.
I DESERVE TO BE IN THERE.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.042
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

22:53.042 --> 22:54.544
YOU DESERVE IT?

22:54.544 --> 22:56.506
HUH?

22:56.506 --> 22:58.808
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A PATIENT, TOO.

22:58.808 --> 23:01.951
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PATIENT?

23:01.951 --> 23:04.984
LOOK, I'M SURE IT'S TOUGH--
SHE HAD A 40-HOUR LABOR,

23:04.984 --> 23:07.987
AND THEN THE BABY WAS STUCK
ON AN ANGLE, WOULDN'T DROP.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.721
SO MY PATIENT
JUST HAD TO PUSH...

23:11.721 --> 23:14.894
AND PUSH AND PUSH.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.897
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU SAY TO A WOMAN

23:17.897 --> 23:19.899
WHO'S IN THAT KIND OF PAIN?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.801
YOU SAY, "ONE MORE, JACKIE.

23:21.801 --> 23:25.174
"ONE MORE, AND YOU'RE
GONNA SEE THAT BABY.

23:25.174 --> 23:29.439
"ONE MORE, AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A BEAUTIFUL BABY BOY.

23:29.439 --> 23:31.441
"I KNOW IT HURTS.
I KNOW IT DOES.

23:31.441 --> 23:34.083
"BUT GIVE ME ONE MORE,
JACKIE,

23:34.083 --> 23:36.986
AND YOU GET A BABY."

23:36.986 --> 23:41.451
THAT'S HOW YOU GET A WOMAN
TO TEAR HER OWN BODY APART.

23:41.451 --> 23:44.423
YOU PROMISE HER A BABY.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.556
YOU MAKE A PROMISE,

23:46.556 --> 23:50.600
AND SHE HURTS HERSELF
BECAUSE SHE TRUSTS YOU.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.962
AND THEN...

23:52.962 --> 23:57.166
WHEN THE BABY COMES OUT
AND HE'S NOT, UH...

23:57.166 --> 24:00.109
HE'S NOT...

24:00.109 --> 24:02.171
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S GOTTA TELL HER

24:02.171 --> 24:05.715
THAT YOU WERE... MISTAKEN.

24:07.477 --> 24:09.519
MAKES ME
KIND OF LOSE INTEREST

24:09.519 --> 24:12.522
IN WHAT YOU DESERVE...

24:12.522 --> 24:16.125
MR. WHERE'S THE CABBAGE PATCH.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.566
(coins clink)

24:26.566 --> 24:28.467
(clicks buttons)

24:28.467 --> 24:31.140
OH, HEY.
DAD'S GOT A KIDNEY STONE.

24:31.140 --> 24:33.503
DR. BAILEY'S TAKING HIM
UP TO THE O.R. NOW.

24:33.503 --> 24:35.805
OH, SHE DIDN'T JUST GIVE HIM
A STRAINER? IT'S GOTTA BE HUGE.

24:35.805 --> 24:37.507
YEAH, WELL,
HE DESERVES IT.

24:37.507 --> 24:39.509
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY
GOT IT BEFORE,

24:39.509 --> 24:41.511
BUT THIS IS HOW HE OPERATES.

24:41.511 --> 24:43.513
HE STARTS UP NEW FAMILIES,
STOPS TALKING TO THE OLD ONES.

24:43.513 --> 24:45.515
HE'LL GO OFF, MARRY DANI
THE TATTOOED LADY,

24:45.515 --> 24:47.216
HAVE SIX LITTLE
MIDLIFE CRISIS BABIES,

24:47.216 --> 24:49.218
AND I'LL NEVER
HEAR FROM HIM AGAIN.

24:49.218 --> 24:52.491
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID
TO YOU.
IT IS NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID TO ME.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.994
OF COURSE IT IS.
LEXIE, MY MOTHER
HAD AN AFFAIR,

24:54.994 --> 24:57.096
AND THEN TOOK HIS KID
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.098
YOUR MOTHER DIED,
AND HE WAS MISERABLE,

24:59.098 --> 25:01.671
AND HE STARTED DRINKING,
AND HE DESTROYED HIS LIVER.

25:01.671 --> 25:04.674
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU. HE FOUND
SOMEONE WHO MAKES HIM HAPPY.

25:04.674 --> 25:07.807
JUST GIVE THEM YOUR BLESSING.
LET HIM BE HAPPY.

25:07.807 --> 25:10.540
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
DON'T DEFEND HIM.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.713
YOU HATE HIM.
HATE HIM WITH ME.

25:13.713 --> 25:17.046
LEXIE, I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE TO GROW UP.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.821
(scoffs)
(door closes)

25:21.821 --> 25:25.625
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:25.625 --> 25:26.926
GOT A STRONG HEARTBEAT.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.928
I THINK SHE LIKES
HER NEW HEART.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.930
OF COURSE SHE DOES.
IT'S DELIGHTFUL.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.964
ALL RIGHT. LET'S TAKE OFF
THE CLAMP, DR. YANG.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.840
WHY IS HER BLOOD PRESSURE
SO LOW?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.713
(Teddy) THERE'S A VERY LOW
ARTERIAL PRESSURE WAVE.

25:43.713 --> 25:45.174
ALL RIGHT, LET'S, UH,
LET'S CHECK IT.

25:45.174 --> 25:48.247
MAYBE THERE'S A KINK
IN THE ART LINE SOMEWHERE.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.680
(monitor beeping erratically)
DAMN IT. TURN UP THE FLOW.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.623
THAT AORTA NEEDS
A LONG DIAGONAL ANASTOMOSIS.

25:53.623 --> 25:57.126
WELL, THAT'LL TAKE
AT LEAST 45 MINUTES.
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE THAT.
WE'VE GOTTA DO IT IN 30,

25:57.126 --> 25:59.929
OTHERWISE WE'RE GONNA LOSE HER.
SCALPEL. CLAMP IT.

25:59.929 --> 26:02.161
START THE CLOCK.

26:02.161 --> 26:06.135
SON OF A BITCH.

26:13.843 --> 26:16.305
I HATE THIS.
I HATE THIS.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.147
COME ON. COME ON.

26:18.147 --> 26:19.649
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:19.649 --> 26:21.651
WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE,
YANG?

26:21.651 --> 26:24.283
27 MINUTES.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.786
OKAY. I'M READY.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.619
CLAMP OFF.

26:29.619 --> 26:31.761
WE GOT THIS.

26:31.761 --> 26:33.623
ROBBINS, ALTMAN,
THEY GOT THIS.

26:33.623 --> 26:36.295
YEAH? THEN WHY DO YOU
LOOK SICK?

26:36.295 --> 26:39.629
(beeping continues)

26:44.704 --> 26:45.935
(beeping continues)

26:45.935 --> 26:47.707
(Teddy)
PRESSURE WAVE'S COMING BACK.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.879
(Arizona) OH.
(Cristina) SYSTOLIC'S 57.

26:49.879 --> 26:51.280
(beeping continues)

26:51.280 --> 26:53.713
60.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.114
64.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.646
(beeping continues)

26:56.646 --> 26:59.288
82.
OH, THAT'S IT. YES.

26:59.288 --> 27:02.351
YES!
YES!

27:05.054 --> 27:07.096
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

27:13.262 --> 27:15.965
CHIEF, I'M, UH,
I'M WITH A PATIENT.

27:15.965 --> 27:19.068
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO LOOK OVER THE MATERIALS?
I DID. IT'S AMAZING.

27:19.068 --> 27:22.071
WELL, THE NEXT STEP IS GETTING
THE FUNDING IN PLACE,

27:22.071 --> 27:25.374
AND I CAN MAKE TWO PHONE CALLS
AND HAVE THAT BY MIDWEEK.

27:25.374 --> 27:28.217
UH, S-SO YOU'RE WAITING
FOR...

27:28.217 --> 27:30.219
UH, YOU.

27:30.219 --> 27:33.082
YOU HAVE TO SIGN ON
AS CO-INVESTIGATOR

27:33.082 --> 27:35.654
SO WE CAN START MOVING FORWARD.
CHIEF, IT'S AN AMAZING OFFER.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.426
IT'S NOT AN OFFER,
MEREDITH.

27:37.426 --> 27:40.429
I CAN'T OFFER SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME.

27:40.429 --> 27:42.431
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S WORK,

27:42.431 --> 27:44.934
AND IT'S ONLY RIGHT
THAT YOU CONTINUE IT.

27:44.934 --> 27:49.769
I, UM... SO YOU THINK
THAT I OWE IT TO HER?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.841
HONESTLY?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.304
I THINK SHE OWES IT TO YOU.

27:55.304 --> 27:57.306
SHE DIDN'T GIVE YOU
A LOT OF LOVE,

27:57.306 --> 28:00.679
BUT SHE GAVE YOU HER TALENT
AND HER NAME...

28:00.679 --> 28:02.752
AND THIS.

28:02.752 --> 28:07.717
THIS GIFT COULD CHANGE
THE COURSE OF YOUR CAREER.

28:07.717 --> 28:11.260
I... HAVE TO
GET BACK INSIDE.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.023
MEREDITH...

28:14.023 --> 28:18.828
IT MIGHT CHANGE THE WAY
YOU THINK ABOUT HER.

28:18.828 --> 28:22.171
IT COULD BE THE GREATEST THING
THE BOTH OF YOU EVER DID.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.882
(Callie grunting)

28:32.882 --> 28:34.884
HOW DID IT GET TO THIS?

28:34.884 --> 28:36.886
HOW DID FOUR SECONDS
OF INTERNET FAME

28:36.886 --> 28:39.388
BECOME WORTH BREAKING YOURSELF
INTO A MILLION PIECES?

28:39.388 --> 28:41.851
(strained voice) HE DID IT
BECAUSE HE THINKS IT'S FUNNY.

28:41.851 --> 28:45.324
THAT'S BULL. YOU DON'T JUST PUT
YOURSELF AT THAT KIND OF RISK.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.327
WELL, IT'S HIS DECISION.
HIS DECISION? IDIOTS LIKE THIS
SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED

28:48.327 --> 28:51.831
TO MAKE ANY--
(normal voice) IT IS HIS BODY,
OKAY? AND YOU DON'T GET TO SAY

28:51.831 --> 28:54.503
WHAT HE CAN AND CAN'T DO
WITH IT. HE IS A PERSON.

28:54.503 --> 28:56.505
HE GETS TO MAKE
HIS OWN DAMN CHOICES.

28:56.505 --> 28:59.308
I AM GOING THROUGH THE WORST
CAFFEINE WITHDRAWAL OF MY LIFE

28:59.308 --> 29:01.240
BECAUSE SOMEONE THINKS
THAT BEING PREGNANT

29:01.240 --> 29:03.512
MEANS I'M NO LONGER
OF SOUND FREAKIN' MIND!
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

29:03.512 --> 29:05.915
SHUT UP!
I'M NOT ENDANGERING MY BABY.

29:05.915 --> 29:09.418
I JUST--I JUST WANT
ONE DAMN CUP OF COFFEE!

29:09.418 --> 29:13.482
OKAY. KEPNER, GO GET
DR. TORRES A CUP OF COFFEE.
OKAY?

29:13.482 --> 29:15.424

RUN.

29:15.424 --> 29:16.755
OH.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.757

29:18.757 --> 29:20.489

CONGRATULATIONS.

29:20.489 --> 29:21.991
OH, WHATEVER.

29:21.991 --> 29:24.994
JUST COME AROUND HERE
AND HELP ME WITH HIS HIP.

29:24.994 --> 29:26.996
ALL RIGHT. ONE...
MM-HMM.

29:26.996 --> 29:29.839
TWO, THREE. (grunts)
(joint pops)

29:29.839 --> 29:33.803
(indistinct conversations)

29:39.408 --> 29:41.050

AND YOUR CANDY.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.189

29:50.189 --> 29:51.891

29:51.891 --> 29:53.062

YEAH, "GIVE THEM YOUR BLESSING."
WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.201
YOU KNOW, "LET HIM BE HAPPY"?
WHAT ABOUT ME, YOU KNOW?

30:02.201 --> 30:05.274
(mouth full) EVERYBODY'S MAKING
THESE HUGE LIFE DECISIONS,

30:05.274 --> 30:08.077
AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN CONSIDERING
HOW IT WILL AFFECT ME,

30:08.077 --> 30:10.209
HOW I'LL FEEL, YOU KNOW?

30:10.209 --> 30:13.482
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE SUCH
A BIG PART OF THEIR LIVES,

30:13.482 --> 30:15.985
AND YET THEY'RE LEAVING ME OUT
OF THE CONVERSATION COMPLETELY.

30:15.985 --> 30:17.987
YOU KNOW,
STARTING UP NEW FAMILIES

30:17.987 --> 30:20.990
AND SPRINGING IT ON ME
WHEN IT'S ALREADY A DONE DEAL.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.992
YOU KNOW, "HEY, LEXIE.
GUESS WHAT.

30:22.992 --> 30:26.295
I FOUND A TATTED-UP SKANK
TO BE YOUR NEW MOMMY."

30:26.295 --> 30:28.497
"HEY, LEXIE. (chuckles)
I'M GONNA HAVE A BABY.

30:28.497 --> 30:32.401
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO BE
OKAY WITH THAT."
WAIT A SECOND.
YOUR DAD'S HAVING A BABY?

30:32.401 --> 30:33.903
NO, NOT MY DAD.

30:33.903 --> 30:35.865
MARK.

30:41.170 --> 30:43.943
MARK IS HAVING A BABY.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.946
(voice breaking) AND HE
DIDN'T EVEN ASK MY OPINION.

30:46.946 --> 30:49.418
HE JUST
CLOBBERED ME WITH IT AGAIN.

30:49.418 --> 30:52.451
AND HE'S LEAVING ME BEHIND...

30:52.451 --> 30:54.884
AGAIN.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.458
SO WE'RE DONE, YOU KNOW?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.290
WE HAVE TO BE.

31:01.290 --> 31:04.964
BUT I MISS HIM.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.066

31:12.902 --> 31:15.044
ISN'T THE BITCH.

31:15.044 --> 31:17.076
I AM.

31:19.909 --> 31:22.511
PROBABLY A GOOD START

31:22.511 --> 31:26.085
WOULD BE TO STOP CALLING HER
A TATTED-UP SKANK.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.157
RIGHT.

OKAY, RANDY, SINCE THERE WAS
A TEAR IN YOUR JOINT CAPSULE,

36:10.168 --> 36:12.341
WE NEEDED TO OPEN UP THE HIP
TO REDUCE IT.

36:12.341 --> 36:15.344
WE PUT A ROD AND SCREWS
INTO THE OTHER FEMUR TO FIX THAT

36:15.344 --> 36:17.206

IS KEEPING

YOU'VE EVER SEEN?

36:27.886 --> 36:30.789
UM, NO. NO, NO.
THE WORST CASE I EVER SAW

36:30.789 --> 36:33.792
WAS A GUY WHO HAD AN EX FIX
IN HIS ARM LIKE THIS ONE,

36:33.792 --> 36:36.325
BUT HE ALSO HAD A GAPING HOLE
WITH EXPOSED BONE

36:36.325 --> 36:38.427
THAT NEEDED TO BE COVERED.

36:38.427 --> 36:40.429
HE ALSO HAD A MATCHING HOLE

36:40.429 --> 36:43.201
THAT, UH,
RIPPED THROUGH HIS BACK

36:43.201 --> 36:44.703

36:44.703 --> 36:46.705
NEEDED 11 SURGERIES
TO RECONSTRUCT HIS ABDOMEN.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.707

36:48.707 --> 36:50.609
NO. NO, HE DIDN'T.

COME TO THINK OF IT,

36:54.843 --> 36:57.386
MM-HMM. HOW?

36:57.386 --> 37:00.389

37:00.389 --> 37:02.220

37:02.220 --> 37:04.653

COULD LAUGH AT HIM.

I GAVE THEM TO YOU.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.785

WAS DIFFERENT.

BUT I AM STARTING TO REALIZE
HOW SCARED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN.

38:14.593 --> 38:18.296
THAT HAD TO BE WHY SHE WAS
WRITING EVERYTHING DOWN.
