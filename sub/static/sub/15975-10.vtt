21:09.936 --> 21:11.597
<i>Dave." In 10.</i>

21:11.671 --> 21:13.935
<i>Will.' Stand by 1-4-4.</i>

21:14.007 --> 21:15.771
<i>Chris: Standing.</i>

21:15.842 --> 21:19.073
<i>In 3...2...</i>

21:19.145 --> 21:20.977
Good evening.
From New York City,

21:21.047 --> 21:22.981
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Mike Greenwey

21:23.049 --> 21:25.950
sitting in for Casey McCall.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.386
Those stories, plus
Mike Ditka goes fishing...

21:28.455 --> 21:31.390
I just went on a date
with one of those guys.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.948
From "Sports Night"?

21:33.026 --> 21:34.050
Yeah.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.595
-- You're kidding.
-- No.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.029
-- You dated a guy from “Sports Night“?
-- Yeah.

21:38.098 --> 21:40.658
Which one -- Dan?
Was it Dan?

21:40.733 --> 21:43.168
[Sighs] It's the one
the guy on the right

21:43.236 --> 21:45.170
is filling in for tonight.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.637
Casey.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.071
Yeah.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.269
-- You dated Casey.
-- A date.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.471
-- You dated Casey McCall.
-- It was really half a date.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.173
'Cause I'm
a "Sports Night" nut.

21:55.248 --> 21:57.273
Then you and Casey would have
gotten along very well.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.875
-- Is he a good guy?
-- Howard...

21:58.952 --> 22:01.046
I mean, in real life,
is he a good guy?

22:01.121 --> 22:02.885
Howard, don't you think this
time would be best spent

22:02.956 --> 22:06.187
talking about you...
or even me?

22:07.594 --> 22:09.323
You went on a date
with Casey McCall.

22:09.395 --> 22:10.521
Yes.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.928
Are you gonna see him again?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.433
No, I'm not.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.128
There are few guarantees
in this life,

22:16.202 --> 22:17.260
but here's one --

22:17.337 --> 22:20.534
I will never
see Casey McCall again.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.041
How you doin'?

22:22.108 --> 22:23.542
-- Oh, my God.
-- Wow.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.044
Isn't this a coinkydink?

22:25.111 --> 22:26.442
Yes...

22:26.513 --> 22:28.641
-- I'm Casey McCall.
-- You don't have to tell me.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.683
-- He's a big fan.
-- Thanks.

22:30.750 --> 22:31.740
Can we go?

22:31.818 --> 22:32.808
We're having a good time.

22:32.886 --> 22:33.819
No, we're not.

22:33.887 --> 22:35.082
She's a tough sell.

22:35.155 --> 22:36.589
I am not a tough sell.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.680
She was just telling me
about your date.

22:37.757 --> 22:38.883
Half a date.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.255
It would have been a whole date,
but she walked out.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.350
Of course I walked out.

22:41.427 --> 22:42.895
Are you with someone tonight?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.452
Yeah, that girl who's sitting
all by herself over there.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.521
Give her a wave.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.158
Don't wave, Howard.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.168
Her name is Jessica.
She's date number eight.

22:50.236 --> 22:52.432
-- I think we should go now.
-- You were date number one.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.166
-- I recall. -- There'll
always be that special --

22:54.240 --> 22:56.436
Get the coats, Howard.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.534
[Clears throat]
Nice meeting you.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.204
Nice meeting you, too.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.215
[indistinct voices,
glasses clinking]

23:03.283 --> 23:05.217
Seems like a nice guy.

23:05.285 --> 23:07.185
He <i>is</i> a nice guy.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.119
[Sighs]

23:11.891 --> 23:14.155
I started to call you,
you know.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.719
-- You're lying.
-- No, I'm not.

23:16.796 --> 23:17.786
-- You started to call me.
-- Yes.

23:17.864 --> 23:18.797
-- What happened?
-- I stopped.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.697
-- Why? -- I don't have
your phone number.

23:20.767 --> 23:23.930
-- Ah. -- But it was only that
realization that prevented me from --

23:24.003 --> 23:25.061
You don't have a phone book?

23:25.138 --> 23:26.731
Do you know how many
people there are

23:26.806 --> 23:28.535
named Pixley Robinson
in the phone book?

23:28.608 --> 23:29.632
-- Yes.
-- How many?

23:29.709 --> 23:30.870
-- One.
-- Okay.

23:30.944 --> 23:31.775
Good night.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.608
Mystery solved.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.910
You should get back
to that poor girl over there.

23:35.982 --> 23:39.475
That poor girl over there is having a
perfectly fine time -- wave for a sec --

23:39.552 --> 23:42.453
as you yourself were having until I
started to tell you about my situation --

23:42.522 --> 23:44.217
The date was
a ridiculous requirement

23:44.290 --> 23:46.315
made by the girl
you really wanted to be with,

23:46.392 --> 23:48.918
and you wouldn't have been there
if you hadn't been forced.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.260
You have a way of making it sound
a lot worse than it really is.

23:52.332 --> 23:54.767
-- Make it sound better.
-- Give me your phone number.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.598
No.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.604
[Sighs deeply]

23:59.672 --> 24:00.969
Okay.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.098
Give me yours.

24:19.525 --> 24:22.187
You signed your name.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.230
Yeah, 'cause it's, uh,
also an autograph.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.458
[Chuckles]

24:25.531 --> 24:27.124
Your friend's waiting for you.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.635
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, absolutely.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.213
<i>Dan: How can you not have heard
of this game? Dave: Dan, I</i> --

24:42.282 --> 24:44.512
It's among the greatest
baseball games ever played...

24:44.584 --> 24:46.416
-- I heard you.
-- In the history of baseball.

24:46.486 --> 24:47.510
I'm not a baseball fan.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.748
You work for a sports show.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.755
I'm a technical director.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.485
At a sports show.
Stop walking.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.721
<i>Everyone should know this.</i>

24:55.795 --> 24:59.732
In 1951, there wasn't a more
passionate rivalry in sports

24:59.799 --> 25:03.235
than the Brooklyn Dodgers
and the New York Giants.

25:03.303 --> 25:04.793
Giants fans
hated Dodger fans,

25:04.871 --> 25:06.396
Dodger fans hated
Giants fans.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.167
Fathers passed it on
to sons.

25:08.241 --> 25:12.371
In August, the Giants were 13
1/2 games out of first place.

25:12.445 --> 25:13.970
That's insurmountable.

25:14.047 --> 25:16.243
Your season's over.
But mnh-mnh.

25:16.316 --> 25:18.580
Giants come back
from 131/2 games,

25:18.651 --> 25:21.712
fall into a first-place tie with
guess who -- the Brooklyn Dodgers.

25:21.788 --> 25:24.849
Now, they play a playoff game to see
who gets to go to the VVorld Series.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.392
And the Dodgers
have it won, right?

25:26.459 --> 25:28.723
Until a guy named Bobby
Thomson hit what they called

25:28.795 --> 25:30.320
"The shot heard
'round the world."

25:30.396 --> 25:32.262
I-| used to listen
to this tape.

25:32.332 --> 25:33.822
There's this famous
announcer's call,

25:33.900 --> 25:37.393
maybe the most famous ever.

25:37.470 --> 25:40.804
[Softly and excitedly] “The Giants win
the Pennant! The Giants win the Pennant!

25:40.873 --> 25:42.637
The Giants win the Pennant!"

25:42.709 --> 25:45.644
His name was Russ Hodges,
and he -- he just kept going,

25:45.712 --> 25:47.544
the guy just kept going on,

25:47.613 --> 25:49.945
"The Giants win the Pennant!
The Giants win the Pennant!"

25:50.016 --> 25:52.508
I-I think I listened to a tape
of Russ Hodges making that call,

25:52.585 --> 25:54.280
I don't know...
[Sighs]

25:54.354 --> 25:58.086
Every night for, I think, four
or five years. [Chuckles]

25:58.157 --> 25:59.488
You like sports,
don't you, Dan?

25:59.559 --> 26:00.924
I really do.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.461
<i>-- He'!-
-- He'!-</i>

26:02.528 --> 26:03.586
-- I gotta go.
-- Thanks.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.131
.- Jeremy?
__ Yes?

26:05.198 --> 26:07.758
I think we should do a feature
on Bobby Thomson's homer.

26:07.834 --> 26:08.926
-- Why?
-- 50th anniversary.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.696
-- Thomson's homer was '51.
-- That's right.

26:10.770 --> 26:11.896
It's the 49th anniversary.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.234
And deserving
of a tribute.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.603
A 49th-anniversary tribute?

26:14.674 --> 26:16.972
What, there's a law it's got
to come with 5s and 10s?

26:17.043 --> 26:18.875
-- VVell, none that I know of.
-- We make our own laws, Jeremy.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.071
Why don't you talk to Isaac?

26:20.146 --> 26:21.978
I don't need Isaac's permission.
I make my own laws.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.277
You do need
Isaac's permission,

26:23.349 --> 26:24.714
but that's not why
you should talk to him.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.013
Why should I talk to him?

26:26.085 --> 26:26.813
He was there.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.411
-- Where?
-- At the game.

26:28.488 --> 26:30.286
-- The Giants game? You're kidding me.
-- Yeah. No.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.120
-- He was there?
-- Yeah.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.250
-- He never told me that.
-- Go talk to him.

26:34.327 --> 26:35.920
How did you know that,
and I didn't know that?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.759
Go talk to him.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.889
-- I will go talk to him.
-- Okay.

26:39.966 --> 26:41.832
You're telling me he was there,
Branca pitched, Thomson swung, crack,

26:41.901 --> 26:43.767
“The Giants win the Pennant! The Giants
win the Pennant!“ -- he was there?

26:43.836 --> 26:44.598
Yes.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.933
Okay.

26:48.674 --> 26:49.732
[ Knocks ]
Yes?

26:49.809 --> 26:52.107
I got a bit of a problem
with you, Isaac.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.374
Yes, thanks for asking.
I'm feeling fine.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.744
You were at the Giants game?

26:55.815 --> 26:57.579
Which Giants game?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.015
The one 49 years ago.

26:59.085 --> 26:59.916
Bobby Thomson?

26:59.986 --> 27:01.147
-- Yes.
-- Yes!

27:01.220 --> 27:02.949
-- <i>And you never told me?</i>
-- <i>You never asked.</i>

27:03.022 --> 27:04.512
-- Did Jeremy ask you? -- No.
-- Then how did he know?

27:04.590 --> 27:05.716
I told him.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.420
We're supposed to have
a special bond, Isaac.

27:08.494 --> 27:09.859
We do.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.023
-- It doesn't seem like it.
-- <i>It's</i> very special.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.533
Not special if you have it
with other people, too.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.159
Why did you come in here?

27:16.235 --> 27:17.634
I want to do a piece
on the game.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.296
For the 49th anniversary?

27:19.372 --> 27:21.898
-- There's a law that says it's gotta
come in 5s and 10s, what? -- No, no.

27:21.974 --> 27:22.964
You covered the game.

27:23.042 --> 27:23.873
Yes.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.172
-- Let me put you on camera.
-- No.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.871
-- To talk about the game.
-- No.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.711
-- Why not?
-- Well, because I said so.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.750
Isaac, this is something
that doesn't happen --

27:31.818 --> 27:33.149
What is the occasion?

27:33.219 --> 27:35.654
It's probably the greatest
baseball game ever played,

27:35.721 --> 27:37.883
and spring is coming --
that's the occasion.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.322
Okay.

27:39.392 --> 27:40.826
-- So you'll go on camera and
talk about the game? -- No.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.224
I want to do
a feature, Isaac.

27:42.295 --> 27:43.888
-- Go ahead.
-- And I want to use you.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.362
-- No.
-- Why not?

27:45.431 --> 27:47.365
There again because I said so.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.867
-- You won't do it for me?
-- No.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.460
I'm not feeling
that special bond.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.527
Life is like that, homey.

27:52.605 --> 27:54.937
Okay.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.106
Momentarily does not mean
"in a moment."

28:02.181 --> 28:04.707
Here's two dissolving
to three.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.843
Thank you.
It means "for a moment."

28:06.919 --> 28:08.409
-- Yes.
-- That makes me crazy.

28:08.488 --> 28:10.923
We've been wondering
what the source was.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.981
Let's see a graphic
for Seattle.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.686
Coming.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.455
It means "for a moment,"
not "in a moment."

28:16.529 --> 28:18.054
Seattle's up.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.100
<i>On the plane when they say,
"We'll be landing momentarily."</i>

28:21.167 --> 28:23.158
I call over a flight attendant,

28:23.236 --> 28:25.170
and tell them,
"if we land momentarily,

28:25.238 --> 28:27.172
"it won't give
the passengers enough time

28:27.240 --> 28:29.072
to get off the plane."

28:29.141 --> 28:32.475
And once safely inside the airport, how long
do they usually detain you for questioning?

28:32.545 --> 28:33.944
Well, they know me by now.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.640
-- Oh, Dana, a word.
-- Hey!

28:35.715 --> 28:38.685
Yes. I'll only be gone
momentarily.

28:38.751 --> 28:42.278
Oh, notice how I didn't say,
<i>"I'll</i> be <i>back</i> momentarily"?

28:42.355 --> 28:44.915
That wouldn't be true,
as I plan on spending

28:44.991 --> 28:46.152
most of the morning on this,

28:46.225 --> 28:47.750
but I'll only be gone
momentarily,

28:47.827 --> 28:49.625
-- which is why I said that I -- yes!
-- Dana...

28:49.695 --> 28:50.628
So...

28:50.696 --> 28:52.221
I'll tell you what else.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.461
-- Hopefully means “full
of hope,“ -- Yes.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.469
With hope in one's heart.

28:57.537 --> 28:59.369
Do you remember
my girlfriend Katie?

28:59.438 --> 29:00.530
No.

29:00.606 --> 29:01.903
-- I have a girlfriend named Katie.
-- Okay.

29:01.974 --> 29:05.171
-- Katie works downstairs with
a woman named Rita. -- Okay.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.269
And Rita has a friend
named Howard.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.780
Bring it around to me.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.442
Howard went out
with Pixley last night.

29:11.517 --> 29:12.916
-- The Pixley?
-- Yes.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.248
Casey's first date?

29:14.320 --> 29:17.051
Yes, but here's why it's
news -- Casey was there.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.181
Where?

29:18.257 --> 29:19.622
On Pixley and Howard's
date last night.

29:19.692 --> 29:21.683
I thought Casey was
on his own date last night.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.695
He went to the same place
as Howard and Pixley.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.026
By coincidence?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.191
I suppose,
but that's really --

29:27.266 --> 29:29.200
Natalie, please don't try and
talk me out of the dating plan.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.134
I have really put
a lot of thought into it.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.830
I know what's best,
and I also know what --

29:32.905 --> 29:35.772
Casey wrote his number down
on her hand.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.676
Wow.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.042
Yes.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.219
He wrote his number down
on her <i>hand?</i>

29:47.286 --> 29:48.583
Yes.

29:50.990 --> 29:53.823
The dating plan sucks.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.929
<i>Hodges: Hartung down the line at
third, not taking any chances.</i>

29:58.998 --> 30:00.693
<i>Lockman without too big
of a lead at second,</i>

30:00.766 --> 30:02.860
<i>but he'll be running like
the wind if Thomson hits one.</i>

<i>Branca throws...
there's a long drive!</i>

30:05.371 --> 30:07.339

30:13.946 --> 30:15.107
.- Jeremy?
__ Yes?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.411
I spoke to Isaac,
and, yes, you're right.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.850
He was at the game,
though he also confirmed

30:19.919 --> 30:21.751
that him and I have a bond
that far exceeds his and yours.

30:21.821 --> 30:23.289
Okay.

30:23.356 --> 30:24.881
He was there.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.790
<i>He saw it. He saw them
take out Newcombe</i>

30:27.860 --> 30:29.157
and put in Branca.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.289
He saw Thomson tap the dirt
off his cleats.

30:32.365 --> 30:33.890
-- He saw it...
-- Yeah.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.991
But he won't go on camera.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.365
I'm not surprised.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.234
-- You're not? He loves
going on camera. -- No.

30:39.305 --> 30:40.500
Dan...

30:40.573 --> 30:41.506
Oh.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.303
-- The stroke.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

30:43.376 --> 30:44.707
The old stroke.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.176
Yes.

30:46.245 --> 30:49.010
Well...he's just wrong.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.310
-- Well, maybe so, but --
-- He's just flat-out wrong.

30:50.383 --> 30:51.316
You just leave it.

30:51.384 --> 30:52.579
-- You think?
-- Yes.

30:52.652 --> 30:53.983
Hmm...no.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.851
I want to talk to him,
make him see how wrong he is.

30:55.921 --> 30:56.854
Oh, that's a better plan.

30:56.922 --> 30:57.980
It is?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.786
You going to treat
the subject with sensitivity?

30:59.859 --> 31:00.951
No.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.995
There you go.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.692
<i>You're an idiot.</i>

31:06.766 --> 31:09.201
Hang on.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.895
Excuse me?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.529
The reason
you won't go on film

31:12.605 --> 31:14.437
with your Bobby Thomson story
is you're self-conscious

31:14.507 --> 31:16.475
about the way you look
and sound since the stroke.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.568
Is there something wrong with the way
I look and sound since the stroke?

31:19.645 --> 31:20.874
Nope.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.710
Honey? Danny thinks
there's a problem

31:22.782 --> 31:26.582
with the way I look
and talk since the stroke.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.120
-- No, no, I --
-- [Chuckles]

Yeah, I thought I was
looking pretty good, too,

31:30.122 --> 31:31.681
-- Isaac, I...
-- But Dan doesn't think so.

31:31.757 --> 31:33.225
It was Jeremy,
actually, who --

31:33.292 --> 31:35.317
I'll talk to you later.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.623
[Receiver hangs up]
How are you?

31:36.696 --> 31:38.926
-- You won't tell your story.
-- No.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.898
-- We still have a special bond?
-- Yes.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.367
Okay.

Nope.

named Rita,

How can I help you?

32:34.720 --> 32:37.314
Howard, who is a fan
of yours,

-- and therefore
slightly troubled, --

signed his date's hand.

32:43.496 --> 32:45.760
[Clears throat]

32:45.831 --> 32:48.562
He, for some reason, was
just too dumb to realize

32:48.634 --> 32:52.127
why you'd written
your phone number as well.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.674
You know what?

32:55.741 --> 32:57.072
What?

32:57.143 --> 32:59.578
The dating plan
was your idea.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.240
Yes, it was.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.511
So I'm just saying...

33:08.754 --> 33:10.188
Let's go.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.399

-- Yes.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.029
The most famous home run
of all time,

33:26.105 --> 33:27.698
and he doesn't want
to talk about it.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.504
-- Yes. -- It's as if something
about it makes him uncomfortable.

33:30.576 --> 33:31.668
-- You know what I'd do?
-- What?

33:31.744 --> 33:33.143
I'd keep prodding him
about it

33:33.212 --> 33:34.441
until he beats you with his
cane and then fires you.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.005
Yeah...that's a good plan.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.015
Thanks.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.073
Hey, Jeremy.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.721
<i>Natalie." Aha!</i>
-- What?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.258
According to the dictionary,

33:46.325 --> 33:48.259
momentarily means both
"for a moment"

33:48.327 --> 33:50.125
-- <i>and "in</i> a <i>moment."</i>
-- <i>Well done.</i>

33:50.196 --> 33:51.630
"Monad," by the way,

-- Yes.

-- Yeah.

-- Can't stop thinking about her,
and you want to call her. -- Yes.

it's an emotional abandonment of Dana.

an abandonment.

of player relations

pick up our credentials

There was no place
to sit in the press box,

the whole game.

on the mound warming up.

Okay.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.048
You want to come?

38:39.118 --> 38:40.517
To your home?

38:40.586 --> 38:41.951
[Chuckles]
No. We're going out.

38:42.020 --> 38:42.987
Uh...l thought you said
you were going home.

38:43.055 --> 38:44.716
Jeremy and I are
going out for a drink.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.224
I'm going to stay here
and work.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.385
-- You sure?
-- Yeah.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.859
-- Okay. Hey, Dan.
-- Hey.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.795
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

38:52.865 --> 38:54.833
-- What do you need?
-- <i>What?</i>

38:54.900 --> 38:57.801
<i>Don't you want
to go out or go home?</i>

38:57.870 --> 39:00.202
Yeah, I'm taking off.

39:00.272 --> 39:02.331
Have a good night.

39:02.407 --> 39:03.841
Hey, listen,

39:03.909 --> 39:05.775
I was talking
to Isaac before.

39:05.844 --> 39:09.144
Did you know that he was
at the Giants game in 1951?

39:09.214 --> 39:10.682
-- Bobby Thomson?
-- Yeah.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.444
I did know that.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.452
Everybody but me.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.352
<i>What about it?</i>

39:16.421 --> 39:18.355
He missed the home run.

39:18.423 --> 39:21.916
He was in the men's room
washing his hands.

39:21.994 --> 39:23.018
Really?

39:23.095 --> 39:24.688
Yeah.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.527
It's kind of funny,
if you think about it.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.760
Yeah, 'cause at the end of the
day, it's just a baseball game.

39:28.834 --> 39:30.165
How is it not funny?

39:30.235 --> 39:31.703
It was an idiotic
dating plan, Dana.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.260
What did you think
was gonna happen?

39:33.338 --> 39:35.067
-- <i>Hey, Dan...</i> -- <i>Forget that
he's meeting all kinds of women.</i>

39:35.140 --> 39:36.904
That was gonna happen.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.103
But the one that he wanted
was you anyway.

39:39.178 --> 39:41.476
Wanted?

39:41.547 --> 39:42.537
[Sighs deeply]

39:42.614 --> 39:44.708
All this is doing
is making him feel

39:44.783 --> 39:46.649
a lot less
like the man he is,

39:46.718 --> 39:49.278
which is why he left Lisa
in the first place.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.016
I know what he wants,
and I got to say

39:52.090 --> 39:55.185
he's done a pretty good job
of going after it,

39:55.260 --> 39:58.355
which isn't, like, the most
natural thing in the world

39:58.430 --> 40:00.194
for Casey to do.

40:00.265 --> 40:03.633
And I know what you want,
and all I've seen you do

40:03.702 --> 40:05.568
is hide behind
this psychotic behavior

40:05.637 --> 40:07.469
all dressed up as cute.

40:09.575 --> 40:12.101
He wanted you,

40:12.177 --> 40:15.306
and he told you
every possible way he could.

40:17.783 --> 40:21.310
You've just been hanging out
in the men's room.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.233
