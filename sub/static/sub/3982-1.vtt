03:21.700 --> 03:23.242
Hey, how did you open your cell door?

03:23.826 --> 03:24.864
Hey!

03:24.968 --> 03:26.005
What are you doing?

03:26.704 --> 03:27.747
Open Sector 2!

03:30.291 --> 03:31.334
How did you get out?

03:33.252 --> 03:34.533
Get back in your cell.

03:36.255 --> 03:37.833
<i>I told you, get back in your cell!</i>

03:38.466 --> 03:40.458
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

03:54.273 --> 03:55.471
Sorry.

04:02.615 --> 04:03.652
Send some guards in.

04:03.757 --> 04:04.794
I'm trying.

04:11.374 --> 04:13.250
Okay, I'm set.
How's things going down below?

04:13.501 --> 04:15.209
How do you think? I'm in a sewer.

04:15.586 --> 04:17.495
The doors won't open! We're locked in!

04:18.214 --> 04:19.255
Sound the alarm!

04:27.807 --> 04:28.885
We've lost control!

04:29.599 --> 04:30.642
Captain!

04:46.157 --> 04:47.817
I'm in position.

04:48.868 --> 04:49.983
Move to phase 2.

05:43.839 --> 05:45.789
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>

05:45.893 --> 05:47.340
What's wrong?
What's happening, Benji?

05:47.509 --> 05:49.334
Oh, God.
He's not going to the extraction point.

05:49.438 --> 05:51.384
Stay focused.
He knows where he's going.

05:58.812 --> 06:01.897
No, I'm not. I won't.
I will not open that door.

06:02.024 --> 06:05.191
Please go to the extraction point, Ethan.
I know.

06:05.361 --> 06:08.065
I know what this means, but I can't.
I'm not authorised...

06:09.615 --> 06:11.239
Go to the extraction point, Ethan.

06:11.408 --> 06:12.867
Go to the extraction point!

06:13.535 --> 06:15.113
Oh, you're just going to wait.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.280
We're going to wait. Great. I can wait.

06:27.466 --> 06:29.423
Okay, fine. Fine! Fine!

06:29.885 --> 06:30.928
There.

06:31.053 --> 06:33.674
We'll just screw
the whole thing up on purpose.

06:39.561 --> 06:42.266
Jane? We're going
to have a slight delay.

07:00.665 --> 07:03.203
Why do you want to go in there?

07:09.757 --> 07:10.800
Bogdan!

07:11.926 --> 07:12.969
Bogdan!

07:14.637 --> 07:15.680
Sergei?

07:16.097 --> 07:17.140
Time to go!

07:17.640 --> 07:18.683
Now?

07:19.058 --> 07:20.101
Yes, now!

07:23.688 --> 07:26.430
I don't know what he's doing,
and for some reason, I'm helping him.

07:26.534 --> 07:28.735
As long as he's where he should be
when the song ends.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.022
We have a passenger.

08:01.767 --> 08:02.846
Sergei!

08:13.362 --> 08:14.986
<i>Open all of them!</i>

08:33.506 --> 08:34.549
Oh God!

08:35.258 --> 08:38.094
Oh God oh God oh God...

08:38.511 --> 08:42.046
Sergei, please tell me there's more to this plan!

09:20.970 --> 09:22.013
Let's go...

09:22.138 --> 09:23.300
Agent Hunt?

09:23.431 --> 09:24.473
And you are?

09:25.141 --> 09:26.183
Agent Carter.

09:26.976 --> 09:28.019
Okay.

09:29.854 --> 09:30.896
Who's your pal?

09:31.022 --> 09:32.184
I'll tell you on the way!

09:36.569 --> 09:37.980
Light the fuse.

11:37.187 --> 11:38.812
Sergei, what's going on?

11:38.939 --> 11:39.977
It's OK, Bogdan.

11:40.081 --> 11:42.015
I don't mean to bring up
the elephant in the room,

11:42.119 --> 11:43.727
but what's with the big, hairy Russian?

11:43.902 --> 11:47.072
Who, Bogdan? He fed me intel. If I left
him there, they would've killed him.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.709
So we're gonna give him his freedom.

11:48.814 --> 11:49.919
Did you call in the sweepers?

11:50.023 --> 11:51.024
On their way.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.736
Good, good.

11:54.288 --> 11:56.826
Benji, how is it you're here?

11:57.291 --> 11:58.951
Oh, I passed the field exam.

11:59.626 --> 12:01.085
Crazy, right?

12:01.629 --> 12:03.123
Yeah. Crazy.

12:03.297 --> 12:04.791
- DNA test.
- It's me.

12:04.923 --> 12:06.790
It's procedure.
I'm just confirming it's you.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.675
- You're very thorough.
- Sergei?

12:08.802 --> 12:10.047
Are you not Russian?

12:10.721 --> 12:11.764
Relax.

12:12.306 --> 12:14.263
Sweepers approaching! Brooms are out!

12:14.391 --> 12:15.850
- Roger that.
- Sergei.

12:17.061 --> 12:19.301
Are you not Sergei?

12:24.108 --> 12:25.484
You'll be fine.

12:25.652 --> 12:26.814
Bogdan.

12:26.986 --> 12:28.363
I always take care of my friends.

12:28.529 --> 12:30.403
My friend.

12:36.746 --> 12:38.157
Messy bringing him along.

12:38.373 --> 12:39.831
I thought it went rather well.

12:39.999 --> 12:42.158
Mind telling me what you were doing
in a Russian prison?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.876
Mind telling me why you broke me out?

12:45.421 --> 12:47.248
This wasn't a rescue mission?

12:47.382 --> 12:48.876
Let me put it this way.

12:49.008 --> 12:51.630
If the Secretary wanted me out of there,

12:52.845 --> 12:54.719
it must be pretty bad out here.

12:58.101 --> 12:59.559
We were after a file.

13:00.353 --> 13:01.598
We lost it.

13:01.771 --> 13:04.227
"We"? Who lost it? You?

13:09.779 --> 13:10.894
Agent Hanaway.

13:11.447 --> 13:12.645
Where's Hanaway?

13:22.792 --> 13:25.080
<i>It was a letter drop.</i>

13:25.210 --> 13:26.835
<i>Classified file.</i>

13:27.296 --> 13:29.502
<i>It should have been a simple intercept.</i>

13:37.889 --> 13:39.799
<i>We knew which train</i>
<i>the courier was on.</i>

13:39.933 --> 13:41.725
ETA, two minutes on the courier.

13:41.852 --> 13:43.530
<i>But there was one thing we didn't know.</i>

13:43.635 --> 13:45.553
Bobcat, your train's six minutes out.

13:45.731 --> 13:46.810
<i>Who the courier was.</i>

14:00.829 --> 14:02.240
It's now or never, Bobcat.

14:03.165 --> 14:06.498
The courier delivering the file,
what's his name?

14:06.710 --> 14:08.121
<i>Go ahead. Shoot.</i>

14:08.295 --> 14:10.122
We are out of time.

14:16.053 --> 14:19.303
I need a name, folks.
I can't track all these people at once.

14:20.641 --> 14:23.974
<i>Marek. Stefanski. For the love of God!</i>

14:24.144 --> 14:25.187
You got it?

14:25.354 --> 14:27.227
Marek Stefanski.

14:29.858 --> 14:30.901
Searching.

14:44.288 --> 14:46.080
I'll take it from here.

14:55.967 --> 14:57.758
Hey, you all right, buddy?

14:57.885 --> 14:59.961
<i>Hanaway dropped the mark</i>
<i>and grabbed his bag.</i>

15:00.096 --> 15:02.551
Sit down. Catch your breath.

15:03.975 --> 15:07.474
<i>He had the file in his hands.</i>
<i>Easy in, easy out.</i>

15:07.645 --> 15:08.688
File secured.

15:10.314 --> 15:13.185
<i>But we weren't the only ones after it.</i>

15:13.317 --> 15:16.188
Bobcat, someone else
has crashed this party.

15:18.155 --> 15:19.353
I'm not alone.

15:20.449 --> 15:21.492
<i>Local police?</i>

15:21.617 --> 15:23.776
No. Armed hostiles.

15:31.210 --> 15:33.962
Hang tight, I'm coming!
Outrigger, back him up.

15:34.630 --> 15:35.875
<i>Negative, Outrigger.</i>

15:36.007 --> 15:38.379
<i>Rendezvous southwest corner,</i>
<i>60 seconds.</i>

15:40.302 --> 15:43.505
<i>Hanaway's lens cam drew a facial</i>
<i>match and triggered a warning.</i>

15:46.683 --> 15:48.011
<i>But it was too late.</i>

15:55.191 --> 15:56.306
No!

16:01.031 --> 16:02.573
You're going to be okay.

16:06.328 --> 16:07.786
You're so beautiful.

16:09.622 --> 16:12.956
I'm sorry, I... I should have told you.

16:17.714 --> 16:19.256
<i>It was my op.</i>

16:21.009 --> 16:22.800
<i>I put him in the field.</i>

16:23.637 --> 16:26.673
<i>And she left him</i>
<i>just alive enough for me to see him die.</i>

16:44.324 --> 16:45.439
I'm sorry.

16:48.869 --> 16:49.912
You know her?

16:50.496 --> 16:52.951
That's Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

16:53.999 --> 16:55.624
Works for diamonds.

16:56.919 --> 16:58.117
What was in the file?

17:06.470 --> 17:08.297
Russian nuclear launch codes.

17:16.271 --> 17:19.972
IMF's been looking for an emerging
extremist, code name, Cobalt.

17:20.108 --> 17:23.193
He's determined to detonate
a nuclear weapon however he can.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.443
We know Moreau's
worked for him before.

17:25.571 --> 17:27.694
What else does IMF know about him?

17:28.909 --> 17:30.190
As much as you do now.

17:30.619 --> 17:32.327
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

17:32.454 --> 17:35.028
you can bet Cobalt's gone
from a person of interest

17:35.165 --> 17:36.541
to enemy number one.

17:37.501 --> 17:38.544
We're here.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.395
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

18:03.776 --> 18:05.520
Why was he in prison?

18:06.612 --> 18:10.361
He disappeared after he and his wife...
You know.

18:11.492 --> 18:14.529
I thought he'd just been transferred.
Put on leave.

18:15.580 --> 18:19.624
There were rumours, though.
Talk of an unsanctioned hit.

18:19.751 --> 18:21.293
<i>Welcome back, Mr Hunt.</i>

18:21.419 --> 18:24.669
<i>In your absence,</i>
<i>IMF has learned that Cobalt is or was</i>

18:24.797 --> 18:27.467
<i>a level-1 nuclear strategist</i>
<i>for Russian intelligence.</i>

18:27.592 --> 18:30.676
<i>Therefore, the only way to uncover</i>
<i>his actual identity</i>

18:30.803 --> 18:33.045
<i>is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.</i>

18:33.931 --> 18:35.694
<i>In order to get past their checkpoints,</i>

18:35.798 --> 18:38.512
<i>you'll be impersonating</i>
<i>General Anatoly Fedorov.</i>

18:38.645 --> 18:40.554
<i>We believe Cobalt</i>
<i>will do everything he can</i>

18:40.688 --> 18:42.645
<i>to destroy any record of his identity.</i>

18:42.774 --> 18:44.813
<i>Your mission,</i>
<i>should you choose to accept it,</i>

18:44.942 --> 18:48.027
<i>is to penetrate the highly-secured</i>
<i>archive inside the Kremlin</i>

18:48.154 --> 18:50.876
<i>and retrieve Cobalt's file</i>
<i>before he can destroy it.</i>

18:50.980 --> 18:54.780
<i>New intel suggests Cobalt</i>
<i>is already en route, leaving you...</i>

18:54.911 --> 18:57.449
<i>...4 hours 52 minutes...</i>

18:57.580 --> 18:58.825
<i>...to infiltrate.</i>

18:58.957 --> 19:01.577
<i>To save time,</i>
<i>we've chosen your team for you.</i>

19:01.708 --> 19:03.037
<i>Agents Carter and Dunn.</i>

19:05.837 --> 19:09.965
<i>As always, should you or any member</i>
<i>of your team be caught or killed,</i>

19:10.092 --> 19:13.046
<i>the Secretary will disavow</i>
<i>any knowledge of your actions.</i>

19:13.178 --> 19:15.634
<i>This message</i>
<i>will self-destruct in five seconds.</i>

19:15.764 --> 19:16.962
<i>Good luck, Ethan.</i>

19:40.831 --> 19:42.111
What do you got?

19:46.837 --> 19:48.794
We're going into the Kremlin.

19:51.008 --> 19:52.799
I thought you said "The Kremlin."

19:54.636 --> 19:56.712
I thought you said "The Kremlin."

19:59.182 --> 20:00.427
Okay.

20:37.887 --> 20:39.844
This is very exciting.

20:41.390 --> 20:42.849
Being out in the field.

20:43.225 --> 20:44.684
With you, you know.

20:45.061 --> 20:47.349
It's a bit of a dream for me.

20:49.565 --> 20:52.981
Love your disguise, by the way.
You look just like him.

20:53.569 --> 20:57.353
It's a shame we're not wearing masks.
You know, like, full masks.

20:58.407 --> 21:00.863
Everybody gets to
wear a mask but Benji.

21:01.952 --> 21:02.990
Sorry.

21:03.094 --> 21:04.787
I'm tense. I babble when I'm nervous.

21:04.914 --> 21:06.871
I'm doing it again. Shut up, Benji.

21:20.929 --> 21:22.471
Okay, seven security guards.

21:22.597 --> 21:25.135
X-ray machines. Cameras.
Metal detectors.

21:25.266 --> 21:27.389
Just what we expected. We can do this.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.726
Releasing in three, two, one.

21:42.784 --> 21:45.571
Game face, game face.
Kremlin game face.

21:49.291 --> 21:50.749
General...

21:51.793 --> 21:52.908
I am Major Egorov.

21:53.712 --> 21:54.910
Your documents.

22:01.761 --> 22:03.503
You should know your boss.

22:03.607 --> 22:04.650
You should know your boss.

22:29.955 --> 22:31.331
I can't find you.

22:37.338 --> 22:38.583
Run it again...

22:38.714 --> 22:39.793
...Private.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.418
Egorov.

22:51.518 --> 22:54.436
Excuse me, General. I didn't recognise you.

22:55.856 --> 22:58.312
You're going to regret this, Egorov.

23:07.201 --> 23:09.158
I think that went quite well.

23:09.370 --> 23:10.412
Just shut it.

23:10.537 --> 23:11.580
Sorry.

24:35.954 --> 24:36.997
It's going to work.

24:38.290 --> 24:41.908
I'm sorry, by the way.
About you and Julia.

24:43.462 --> 24:45.253
You know, not working out.

24:45.631 --> 24:49.000
I wanted to say something
before you went away, but...

24:49.134 --> 24:50.414
I liked her, you know.

24:51.637 --> 24:53.261
He's off the phone now.

28:30.561 --> 28:31.841
It's empty.

28:33.022 --> 28:34.397
The nest is empty.

28:49.371 --> 28:50.616
Check in, Team Leader.

28:50.873 --> 28:51.915
<i>Over.</i>

28:52.041 --> 28:54.164
<i>Repeat. Check in, Team Leader.</i>

28:54.960 --> 28:56.668
Have you made it to the Archive Room?

28:57.004 --> 28:58.628
Captain! The Archive Room!

28:58.881 --> 28:59.923
Run!

29:02.301 --> 29:03.885
Someone is piggybacking our frequency.

29:04.719 --> 29:05.756
<i>Team Leader,</i>

29:05.861 --> 29:09.629
awaiting your go-sign.
Standing by to detonate.

29:09.807 --> 29:10.850
Abort.

29:14.562 --> 29:16.187
Rendezvous nine-two.

30:36.768 --> 30:37.848
Shut the gate!

30:39.771 --> 30:40.814
Quickly!

32:32.632 --> 32:34.342
Our media is no more
truthful than yours,

32:34.968 --> 32:36.379
American.

32:37.095 --> 32:40.713
But we both know
that the real cause of the explosion

32:41.099 --> 32:42.379
was you.

32:47.772 --> 32:49.848
<i>Awaiting your go-sign, Team Leader.</i>

32:49.983 --> 32:51.940
<i>Standing by to detonate.</i>

32:52.944 --> 32:54.403
The worst part for you,

32:55.238 --> 32:56.483
"Team Leader,"

32:57.365 --> 33:00.568
is I am the man assigned
to make you suffer for it.

33:01.119 --> 33:03.242
For what you did to my country.

33:06.166 --> 33:08.123
This is a hospital...

33:08.627 --> 33:09.669
Not a night club.

33:10.337 --> 33:11.617
Misha... help me here...

33:12.964 --> 33:14.007
Room twelve.

33:28.396 --> 33:31.895
The doctors say he's lucky to be alive.

33:35.319 --> 33:37.395
Only a mild concussion.

33:37.613 --> 33:39.487
I don't give a damn about his health.

33:42.159 --> 33:45.195
I have questions that need answering.

33:47.456 --> 33:48.654
Be careful!

33:50.668 --> 33:51.948
Prepare a transport.

33:57.591 --> 33:58.634
Check over there!

34:39.924 --> 34:41.549
Not a good idea.

34:43.052 --> 34:45.839
It seemed like one a minute ago.

35:39.525 --> 35:42.729
All agents! Hot target heading west!

36:02.130 --> 36:03.210
<i>Consolidated Insurance.</i>

36:03.340 --> 36:04.377
<i>How may I help you?</i>

36:04.482 --> 36:08.380
SAT 20. Agent 82-Delta-Echo
requesting immediate evac.

36:08.762 --> 36:11.004
Rendezvous Alpha 113.

36:11.139 --> 36:13.927
<i>Confirmed. Alpha 113.</i>

36:37.332 --> 36:40.203
<i>Details surrounding</i>
<i>the intricate system of gas lines</i>

36:40.335 --> 36:43.005
<i>that run beneath the square</i>
<i>are still forthcoming,</i>

36:43.130 --> 36:46.047
<i>but the majority of</i>
<i>those lines date back to the Soviet era</i>

36:46.174 --> 36:48.381
<i>and have not been updated in at least...</i>

36:48.844 --> 36:53.754
Anna... Anna... I've been thinking...

36:54.890 --> 36:55.933
It looks like we...

37:00.563 --> 37:02.555
We should leave town
for a couple of days.

37:02.690 --> 37:05.311
Alex, you, me. Vacations.

37:06.319 --> 37:07.647
- Now?
- Tonight.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.611
<i>Why are you speaking in English?</i>

37:10.448 --> 37:11.906
Just...

37:12.033 --> 37:13.776
Just the three of us.

37:13.909 --> 37:17.610
<i>...may not have been an accident,</i>
<i>but a targeted attack.</i>

37:19.040 --> 37:20.677
<i>Preliminary numbers are just starting...</i>

37:20.781 --> 37:21.798
Where will we go?

37:21.902 --> 37:24.082
<i>...to come in regarding</i>
<i>those wounded in the blast.</i>

37:24.211 --> 37:26.453
<i>We can confirm that 11 tourists...</i>

37:26.589 --> 37:27.626
Leonid?

37:27.731 --> 37:29.415
<i>...their nationalities still unconfirmed,</i>

37:29.519 --> 37:32.550
<i>have been transported</i>
<i>to area hospitals for treatment.</i>

37:33.012 --> 37:36.345
<i>While Russian officials continue</i>
<i>to blame a gas-main break,</i>

37:36.474 --> 37:40.768
<i>experts are citing the shape of the blast</i>
<i>area and the size of the debris field</i>

37:40.895 --> 37:43.646
<i>as more consistent</i>
<i>with that of a set explosive,</i>

37:43.773 --> 37:46.014
<i>leading to speculation</i>
<i>that this may have been</i>

37:46.119 --> 37:48.064
<i>an undeclared act of aggression.</i>

37:48.277 --> 37:50.317
<i>Although the Defence Ministry</i>
<i>is maintaining</i>

37:50.446 --> 37:52.000
<i>that this is strictly an accident...</i>

37:52.104 --> 37:54.533
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

37:55.868 --> 37:57.197
We're leaving now.

37:58.663 --> 37:59.860
Anya!

38:01.748 --> 38:02.911
Anya!

38:15.053 --> 38:16.713
We have work to do.

38:46.626 --> 38:47.669
Mr Secretary.

38:52.048 --> 38:53.414
I wasn't aware you were in Russia.

38:53.518 --> 38:57.001
I'm not.
Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

39:01.474 --> 39:04.179
Yesterday I flew in
to accept the order of Friendship

39:04.311 --> 39:05.769
from the Russian Prime Minister.

39:06.062 --> 39:08.517
Now I'm headed back to Washington

39:08.647 --> 39:11.269
to hand the President my resignation.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.692
My Chief Analyst, William Brandt.

39:18.324 --> 39:19.522
Do you have a pen?

39:19.658 --> 39:20.701
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

39:22.202 --> 39:23.282
Yeah.

39:25.497 --> 39:27.122
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

39:28.500 --> 39:29.543
Chief Analyst, you say?

39:29.668 --> 39:31.451
If you're implying that
I made a bad call...

39:31.556 --> 39:32.701
European male.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.041
Fifties. About six-foot,
180 pounds. Blue eyes.

39:36.175 --> 39:37.455
Who is he?

39:39.345 --> 39:42.180
A crude drawing,
but by your description,

39:42.306 --> 39:43.634
that could be Kurt Hendricks.

39:43.766 --> 39:47.300
190 IQ. Served in
Swedish Special Forces.

39:47.436 --> 39:50.307
Professor of physics,
Stockholm University.

39:50.439 --> 39:52.099
Specialist in nuclear endgame theory.

39:52.232 --> 39:53.857
Asked to resign...

39:55.527 --> 39:57.152
Well, because he's crazy.

39:58.197 --> 39:59.239
Cobalt.

40:02.368 --> 40:04.630
You have to alert the Kremlin
that one of their strategists

40:04.735 --> 40:05.947
has a nuclear launch device

40:06.372 --> 40:09.159
and one of his operatives
has the codes to activate it.

40:09.291 --> 40:10.489
And what makes you say that?

40:11.794 --> 40:12.836
I saw him

40:13.711 --> 40:16.167
<i>leaving the executive armoury,</i>
<i>bag in hand.</i>

40:16.297 --> 40:18.539
He set off that explosion
to cover his tracks.

40:18.675 --> 40:20.896
It could be weeks
before the Russians know it's missing.

40:21.000 --> 40:21.996
Unless we tell them.

40:22.100 --> 40:23.595
They won't listen to us.

40:23.721 --> 40:27.636
As far as the Russians are concerned,
we just bombed the Kremlin.

40:28.309 --> 40:30.681
The tension between
the United States and Russia

40:30.812 --> 40:33.766
hasn't been this high
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

40:34.190 --> 40:38.188
And the blame, right or wrong,
points to IMF.

40:42.991 --> 40:46.609
The President has initiated
Ghost Protocol.

40:47.370 --> 40:50.406
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

40:53.459 --> 40:55.369
So what happens now?

40:55.503 --> 40:58.789
Now, I've been ordered
to take you back to Washington,

40:58.923 --> 41:01.924
where the DoD will label you
as a rogue extremist

41:02.093 --> 41:04.631
and hang the Kremlin bombing
on you and your team.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.008
Unless,

41:07.765 --> 41:09.307
you were to escape

41:09.434 --> 41:12.637
somewhere between here
and the airport,

41:12.770 --> 41:16.353
having assaulted Mr Brandt and me.

41:16.482 --> 41:17.525
Sir?

41:18.443 --> 41:19.641
You would then

41:19.777 --> 41:21.695
illegally scrounge
whatever material you could

41:21.862 --> 41:24.353
from a backup supply cache
that I've overlooked.

41:24.489 --> 41:27.775
The same cache where
your team are waiting for further orders.

41:27.909 --> 41:28.947
Sir, you may want to...

41:29.051 --> 41:33.744
You will then disappear, and this
conversation never having taken place,

41:33.874 --> 41:36.495
your intentions would be unclear.

41:36.627 --> 41:40.327
But if any one of your team
is caught or killed,

41:40.464 --> 41:42.587
they will be branded terrorists,

41:42.716 --> 41:46.167
out to incite global nuclear war.

41:53.352 --> 41:54.394
Your mission,

41:55.646 --> 41:57.722
should you choose to accept it.

42:02.361 --> 42:04.567
Ethan, you were my best man.

42:05.864 --> 42:07.608
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

42:07.741 --> 42:10.197
after all the sacrifices you made.

42:12.537 --> 42:14.660
If we don't meet again,
I just want you to know,

42:15.958 --> 42:17.459
I've always considered you a friend.

42:19.670 --> 42:21.543
Stay down! Drive, drive, drive!

42:48.281 --> 42:49.318
You okay?

42:49.422 --> 42:50.460
Yeah.

42:50.950 --> 42:53.619
Take a deep breath. Stay with me.

42:53.744 --> 42:54.989
- Ready?
- Yeah.

43:19.604 --> 43:20.848
What do we do?

43:22.440 --> 43:23.482
Wait here.

43:25.776 --> 43:27.568
Where else am I going to go?

43:42.751 --> 43:44.459
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

43:58.266 --> 44:00.722
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

44:01.519 --> 44:02.717
Hold your fire!

44:03.647 --> 44:04.845
Hold your fire!

44:05.106 --> 44:06.269
Weapons down!

44:07.984 --> 44:09.812
What are you firing at?

44:31.132 --> 44:34.252
Two prisoners escaped from Rankow Prison today.

44:42.226 --> 44:43.269
And this one?

44:44.270 --> 44:45.847
What do we know about him?

44:49.650 --> 44:51.061
Why would that work?

44:52.736 --> 44:53.851
Why would what work?

44:53.988 --> 44:56.111
The flare on the body,
why would that work?

44:56.240 --> 44:57.354
It did work.

44:57.491 --> 44:59.282
- Yeah, I know, but...
- Hey!

44:59.410 --> 45:03.573
But why? I mean, how did you know
that would draw their fire?

45:03.706 --> 45:05.829
I didn't. I played a hunch.

45:07.584 --> 45:10.870
Okay. All right,
so what was your scenario?

45:11.005 --> 45:13.709
Right, you...
There's a guy being shot at in the water.

45:13.841 --> 45:16.925
All of a sudden, decides to light up
a flare and swim around?

45:18.095 --> 45:20.668
I mean, what did you assume
they'd be thinking?

45:20.806 --> 45:22.466
- Thinking?
- Yeah.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.387
I didn't assume they were thinking.

45:25.519 --> 45:27.615
I assumed they were shooting
at anything that moved.

45:27.719 --> 45:29.971
I just gave them a target. Look, these...

45:30.107 --> 45:32.812
These guys aren't
Rhodes Scholars, you know?

45:36.989 --> 45:38.567
It's really happening, isn't it?

45:39.450 --> 45:40.492
Yeah.

45:41.619 --> 45:43.037
Okay, you know what that sound is?

45:43.162 --> 45:44.905
That's our ride out of here!

45:45.039 --> 45:48.242
All right, it's a green car. Number 47.

45:51.502 --> 45:52.997
I see green!

45:53.129 --> 45:54.623
Okay, let's do it.

45:54.756 --> 45:56.250
Go, go, go, go.

45:57.884 --> 45:59.960
All right, 47.

46:00.094 --> 46:01.292
I don't see it.

46:01.429 --> 46:02.840
47.

46:02.972 --> 46:04.253
Oh, shit!

46:10.730 --> 46:12.806
This is it. The manifest.

46:12.941 --> 46:14.483
<i>Enter your code.</i>

46:14.609 --> 46:15.652
Pole!

46:18.613 --> 46:19.728
Jeez...

46:21.324 --> 46:22.783
<i>Press enter.</i>

46:25.161 --> 46:26.489
Retinal scanner!

46:30.124 --> 46:32.283
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

46:32.418 --> 46:33.699
Watch out!

46:34.587 --> 46:36.544
<i>Retinal scan required.</i>

46:36.673 --> 46:38.215
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

46:51.854 --> 46:54.559
Ethan? Jeez, I thought you were dead!

46:54.691 --> 46:56.398
- We are.
- Who's this?

46:56.525 --> 46:59.810
Agents Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, Chief Analyst.

46:59.945 --> 47:01.225
Analyst?

47:06.201 --> 47:08.657
<i>Agent confirmed.</i>

47:15.377 --> 47:19.078
<i>How will the world finally end?</i>

47:19.214 --> 47:22.085
<i>It is my job to predict the unthinkable.</i>

47:23.719 --> 47:26.210
<i>To treat the death of billions as a game.</i>

47:27.889 --> 47:31.175
<i>After 20 years of this, I was numb.</i>

47:32.060 --> 47:35.014
<i>Until a new question crossed my mind.</i>

47:36.023 --> 47:38.810
<i>What happens after</i>
<i>the end of the world?</i>

47:38.984 --> 47:41.107
Are you sure your line is secure?

47:41.236 --> 47:42.944
<i>Every two or three million years...</i>

47:43.071 --> 47:46.108
Are you certain your line is secure?

47:46.241 --> 47:50.286
<i>...some natural catastrophe</i>
<i>devastates all life on Earth.</i>

47:50.412 --> 47:52.037
<i>But life goes on.</i>

47:52.414 --> 47:55.949
<i>And what little remains</i>
<i>is made stronger.</i>

47:56.084 --> 48:00.034
<i>Put simply,</i>
<i>world destruction is an unpleasant,</i>

48:00.172 --> 48:02.544
<i>but necessary part of evolution.</i>

48:05.217 --> 48:07.257
<i>What happens then, I wondered,</i>

48:07.637 --> 48:09.962
<i>when mankind faces</i>
<i>the next end of the world?</i>

48:10.097 --> 48:13.051
I don't care what you have to do
to get him to Dubai.

48:13.184 --> 48:15.639
I'll make it worth his while. Just do it.

48:15.770 --> 48:18.225
<i>I looked to Hiroshima, Nagasaki...</i>

48:18.356 --> 48:19.555
I'll be waiting for your call.

48:19.659 --> 48:22.062
<i>...thriving cities rebuilt from the ashes,</i>

48:22.193 --> 48:24.518
<i>monuments to the unimaginable,</i>

48:24.654 --> 48:26.480
<i>dedicated to the concept of peace.</i>

48:27.198 --> 48:31.694
<i>It occurred to me here</i>
<i>that nuclear war might have a place</i>

48:31.827 --> 48:33.238
<i>in the natural order.</i>

48:33.371 --> 48:35.410
<i>But only if it could be controlled.</i>

48:35.873 --> 48:40.085
<i>Only if it touched</i>
<i>every living soul equally.</i>

48:41.629 --> 48:44.630
IMF now believes this man,
Kurt Hendricks,

48:44.757 --> 48:47.674
is the nuclear extremist,
code name Cobalt.

48:47.802 --> 48:49.675
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin,

48:49.804 --> 48:52.425
with what is likely
a nuclear launch device.

48:54.850 --> 48:57.887
Two days ago, Sabine Moreau killed
one of our agents in Budapest

48:58.020 --> 49:00.642
and relieved him
of Russian nuclear launch codes.

49:00.773 --> 49:05.186
Intel indicates she will check into
the Burj Hotel in Dubai in 36 hours.

49:06.529 --> 49:08.652
Marius Wistrom
is a known operative of Cobalt.

49:08.906 --> 49:11.194
Wistrom is currently en route to Dubai.

49:11.324 --> 49:14.989
For the launch device to work,
Cobalt needs the activation codes.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.907
He's sending Wistrom
to buy them from Moreau.

49:18.915 --> 49:20.374
The Secretary

49:22.002 --> 49:23.164
is dead.

49:28.550 --> 49:31.337
The President
has invoked Ghost Protocol.

49:32.095 --> 49:33.637
We're shut down.

49:33.763 --> 49:37.713
No satellite, safe house,
support, or extraction.

49:37.851 --> 49:40.971
The four of us
and the contents of this car

49:41.104 --> 49:43.725
are all that remain of the IMF.

49:43.857 --> 49:48.151
And as of this moment, any action
is unsanctioned. So if you want out,

49:48.278 --> 49:49.558
speak now.

50:06.171 --> 50:07.369
Our mission is Hendricks.

50:07.797 --> 50:09.685
We're all that stands
between him and his goal.

50:09.789 --> 50:10.957
Nothing can be left to chance.

50:11.061 --> 50:13.008
Everyone connected with this man

50:13.136 --> 50:16.339
is considered an asset with valuable
information about our target.

50:16.473 --> 50:17.921
No one can know we're still on line.

50:18.025 --> 50:20.262
We lose Hendricks now,
we lose him forever.

50:20.392 --> 50:21.934
So, what's the play?

50:22.061 --> 50:24.634
Wistrom will take delivery from Moreau
in 36 hours.

50:24.772 --> 50:26.888
Now we cannot let
the launch codes leave the hotel,

50:26.993 --> 50:29.853
but we need Wistrom
to lead us to Hendricks.

50:29.985 --> 50:32.025
He'll only do that if he has the codes.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.529
Or if he thinks he has them.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.862
Our objective is to intercept the sale,

50:35.991 --> 50:38.198
replace the authentic
codes with counterfeits

50:38.327 --> 50:40.070
and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.

50:40.204 --> 50:41.532
Well, that's simple enough.

50:41.664 --> 50:43.822
We snatch the codes,
we gin up some fakes.

50:43.958 --> 50:48.536
Jane, you double Moreau, and sell the
codes to Wistrom and Bob's your uncle.

50:48.671 --> 50:52.040
And how do you propose
we just snatch the codes from Moreau?

50:52.174 --> 50:53.217
We take her out.

50:55.344 --> 50:58.049
Yeah, we take her out.
But, you know, discreetly.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.343
Discreetly?

51:00.015 --> 51:01.094
Yeah.

51:02.184 --> 51:05.518
Right, she's an asset. Right. I get it.
Sorry. Nothing left to chance.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.054
He said... I'm spitballing.
It's not all gonna be gold.

51:08.190 --> 51:09.775
- We don't touch Wistrom.
- All right.

51:09.942 --> 51:10.985
Or Moreau.

51:13.279 --> 51:16.315
She'll answer for Hanaway,
but it has to be when I say.

51:16.448 --> 51:18.108
After we hit Hendricks.

51:24.205 --> 51:25.368
Only pack what we need.

51:25.498 --> 51:27.989
Yeah, absolutely. Only pack what we...
You never know.

51:55.945 --> 51:58.353
So even if we can double
Wistrom and Moreau,

51:59.157 --> 52:01.233
how do we keep them in separate rooms

52:01.367 --> 52:03.989
while having them think that
they're in the same room?

52:04.120 --> 52:06.077
We give the hotel a facelift.

52:06.372 --> 52:09.042
Wistrom will think
he's arriving at Moreau's suite,

52:09.167 --> 52:11.373
but, really, he'll be
walking into our decoy room.

52:11.544 --> 52:13.003
Where I'll double Moreau.

52:13.296 --> 52:14.881
Downstairs, Benji will double Wistrom.

52:15.089 --> 52:16.127
Masks!

52:16.231 --> 52:17.626
And meet with the real Moreau.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.212
And...

52:19.969 --> 52:21.084
What am I doing?

52:21.888 --> 52:24.343
You? You're the helper!

52:27.268 --> 52:28.644
Helper. That's great.

52:29.228 --> 52:33.177
Okay, so to the extent I understand
what you're talking about here...

52:34.483 --> 52:36.850
The Burj Khalifa,
it's the tallest building in the world,

52:36.954 --> 52:39.232
and you want to alter its infrastructure

52:39.363 --> 52:42.114
with the hopes of convincing
two people that they've

52:42.240 --> 52:45.526
had a meeting,
which actually really never happened.

52:46.286 --> 52:47.329
Right?

52:56.004 --> 52:57.047
Camels.

53:44.552 --> 53:46.675
<i>ETA on dry cleaning.</i>

53:46.804 --> 53:48.263
On my way up.

53:51.851 --> 53:53.642
Okay, 34 minutes to door knock.

53:57.523 --> 53:59.183
Wow...

54:00.526 --> 54:04.654
okay, this is a slight wrinkle,
but nothing to worry about.

54:04.780 --> 54:08.066
We're just going to have to go into
the server room from the outside.

54:09.327 --> 54:10.369
What?

54:10.870 --> 54:14.073
Well, the firewalls on this building's
server are military grade.

54:14.206 --> 54:15.998
I mean, this would be a cinch

54:16.125 --> 54:17.762
if I could call Youssef
back at headquarters,

54:17.866 --> 54:19.743
but Youssef doesn't exist any more,
and neither do we.

54:19.848 --> 54:21.328
I could hack it,
but it would take too long.

54:21.432 --> 54:22.397
Then hardwire in.

54:22.501 --> 54:24.102
And there's four layers
of next-gen security

54:24.206 --> 54:25.311
between us and the server room.

54:25.416 --> 54:27.219
There's no way
we can get to it from inside.

54:27.929 --> 54:30.483
If we can't get to the server,
we don't control the elevators,

54:30.587 --> 54:32.383
we don't control the security cameras.

54:32.516 --> 54:34.556
This operation is over
before it even begins.

54:34.685 --> 54:36.635
I'm telling you,
we can get to it from outside.

54:36.739 --> 54:37.782
"We"?

54:39.023 --> 54:40.186
I'm... I'm on the computer.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.068
I'm just...

54:44.195 --> 54:45.474
The helper.

54:48.865 --> 54:50.063
What floor is it on?

54:50.200 --> 54:51.694
130.

54:52.535 --> 54:54.160
130?

54:58.416 --> 54:59.720
- Vent ducts.
- Pressure sensitive.

54:59.824 --> 55:00.783
Not enough time.

55:00.888 --> 55:02.243
- Elevator shaft.
- Infrared sensors.

55:02.347 --> 55:03.390
Not enough time.

55:06.883 --> 55:08.591
How am I supposed to do this?

55:14.766 --> 55:16.225
God damn it!

55:19.771 --> 55:21.051
Oh, that's high.

55:26.653 --> 55:30.603
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off
motion that disengages the bond.

55:30.740 --> 55:32.863
When the metre is blue,
that's full adhesion.

55:32.993 --> 55:35.116
Easy way to remember, blue is glue.

55:35.245 --> 55:36.656
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

55:36.788 --> 55:39.623
Here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

55:39.749 --> 55:42.536
Both going back here. One, two.

55:42.919 --> 55:46.703
Okay, Ethan, the hotel server is
eleven storeys up and seven units over.

55:46.840 --> 55:48.749
Okay? Comm check.

55:49.593 --> 55:51.051
Yeah. Copy.

55:52.678 --> 55:53.793
So...

55:57.808 --> 56:00.299
It's 26 minutes to door knock.

56:02.354 --> 56:03.517
Yeah.

56:58.202 --> 57:00.324
<i>25 minutes to door knock.</i>

57:15.385 --> 57:16.665
What the hell is that?

57:32.068 --> 57:34.357
<i>Yeah, what the hell is that?</i>

57:35.905 --> 57:37.530
It's a sandstorm.

57:39.742 --> 57:40.837
It's a long way off, Ethan.

57:40.941 --> 57:42.191
<i>Shouldn't be a problem.</i>

57:45.248 --> 57:47.739
<i>24 minutes to door knock.</i>

57:50.753 --> 57:51.833
Where's Ethan?

57:54.924 --> 57:56.205
You've got to be kidding me.

58:46.141 --> 58:49.261
<i>23 minutes to door knock.</i>

59:07.996 --> 59:09.277
<i>I'm at server level.</i>

59:32.103 --> 59:33.383
22 minutes to door knock.

59:34.689 --> 59:37.144
The countdown is not helping.

59:39.193 --> 59:40.236
I'm just saying.

01:00:10.474 --> 01:00:11.512
<i>I'm in.</i>

01:00:11.616 --> 01:00:13.311
That's great, Ethan.
You're halfway home.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.099
<i>Located server.</i>

01:00:29.242 --> 01:00:30.736
Please tell me we're online.

01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:32.067
All right, we're live.

01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:36.410
Okay, I now have control of
the elevators and the security cameras.

01:00:36.541 --> 01:00:37.579
Time to redecorate.

01:00:37.683 --> 01:00:40.585
Okay, you drive.
And look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

01:00:55.435 --> 01:00:57.593
Moreau is at the elevators
ahead of schedule.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:00:59.803
Go.

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.106
We can't open this door, can we?

01:01:07.238 --> 01:01:08.483
<i>The door? No.</i>

01:01:08.615 --> 01:01:10.406
Ethan, you gotta get down here now.

01:01:11.785 --> 01:01:13.243
<i>Ethan!</i>

01:01:13.787 --> 01:01:15.993
<i>Is there a problem? Ethan?</i>

01:01:23.296 --> 01:01:24.334
We're not gonna make it.

01:01:24.438 --> 01:01:25.475
We have to make it.

01:01:26.633 --> 01:01:27.675
Where's Ethan?

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:51.948
Your line's not long enough!

01:01:52.574 --> 01:01:53.773
No shit!

01:02:40.872 --> 01:02:42.449
That was not easy,

01:02:42.582 --> 01:02:44.206
but I did it.

01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:47.826
What'd I miss?

01:02:55.178 --> 01:02:58.594
The lens might be a little uncomfortable.

01:02:58.723 --> 01:03:01.643
It captures images and transmits them
to the printer in the briefcase.

01:03:02.727 --> 01:03:04.601
All right?

01:03:04.729 --> 01:03:07.185
I can't see out of one eye, but I'm fine.

01:03:07.315 --> 01:03:08.857
Blink twice to activate the shutter.

01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:11.777
Notice the numbers are in order?

01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:16.366
A perfect copy.

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:20.368
But the numbers are scrambled.

01:03:21.996 --> 01:03:23.034
Masks?

01:03:23.138 --> 01:03:25.115
60 seconds.
You sure I shouldn't wear a mask?

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:27.372
You know,
'cause I'm not exactly omar Sharif.

01:03:27.502 --> 01:03:29.587
I'll play it French.
This is your tracking device.

01:03:29.754 --> 01:03:31.600
- This is what you're tracking.
- The paper clip?

01:03:31.704 --> 01:03:32.642
No, it's the paper.

01:03:32.747 --> 01:03:35.437
It's in the briefcase. It's coated with
isotopes which give off a unique...

01:03:35.541 --> 01:03:36.897
It just means
that you can track the documents

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:38.002
even if they switch briefcases.

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.055
Range?

01:03:39.159 --> 01:03:40.421
Not that good. It's, like, half a mile.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:42.568
Safest thing to do would be not let
Wistrom out of your sight.

01:03:42.672 --> 01:03:43.808
Is that Wistrom?

01:03:48.188 --> 01:03:49.226
Who's that with him?

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:52.119
I don't know. We don't have an uplink,
so there's no facial recognition.

01:03:52.223 --> 01:03:53.401
Who's that with him?

01:03:54.778 --> 01:03:57.399
That's Leonid Lisenker.
Polish-born cryptographer.

01:03:57.531 --> 01:03:59.992
He redesigned Russia's nuclear
security after the Cold War.

01:04:00.617 --> 01:04:02.526
He's here to authenticate
the launch codes.

01:04:02.661 --> 01:04:04.736
- Yes, he is. We are blown.
- No, we're not blown.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.280
Well, we will be as soon as he sees
the counterfeit launch codes.

01:04:07.384 --> 01:04:08.427
We're not blown.

01:04:08.959 --> 01:04:09.996
He's in the elevator.

01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:11.248
Delay them.

01:04:20.637 --> 01:04:22.671
Benji, how long would it take you
to reprogram the case?

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:24.679
A couple of seconds. What for, though?

01:04:24.808 --> 01:04:26.931
To make an exact copy
of the launch codes.

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.602
- What?
- You can't do that.

01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:30.188
- Wistrom's on 22!
- Slow him down.

01:04:30.314 --> 01:04:31.356
I'll do what I can.

01:04:34.151 --> 01:04:35.693
Wait, wait. Ethan, hang on now!

01:04:35.819 --> 01:04:37.100
Hang on. Just a second.

01:04:37.237 --> 01:04:40.689
You're talking about handing over active
nuclear launch codes to Wistrom?

01:04:40.824 --> 01:04:41.862
Yes. Reprogram the case.

01:04:41.966 --> 01:04:42.993
Listen... Stop!

01:04:43.097 --> 01:04:44.296
Just listen to what you're saying.

01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:45.985
You're fixating.
You're not thinking clearly.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:49.031
It's not gonna happen. I won't let it!

01:04:49.165 --> 01:04:50.410
33 and climbing!

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:51.704
Brandt, use your head now.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:53.826
The mission is not the codes,
the mission is Hendricks.

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:56.120
Then just let it play out.
Give him bad codes. Neutralise him.

01:04:56.224 --> 01:04:57.225
You know that won't do it.

01:04:57.329 --> 01:04:59.747
Failure to a terrorist
is just a rehearsal for success.

01:04:59.884 --> 01:05:01.212
41!

01:05:01.344 --> 01:05:03.731
We lose Hendricks today,
he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

01:05:03.836 --> 01:05:04.811
He finds another way.

01:05:04.915 --> 01:05:06.258
With no IMF to stop him.

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:08.590
No. It's now or never.
Now, Brandt, give me the case.

01:05:08.695 --> 01:05:10.807
Nothing can be left to chance.
You said that.

01:05:10.937 --> 01:05:11.974
You're the analyst.

01:05:12.078 --> 01:05:14.534
Now, tell me there's not another way
for Hendricks to get those codes.

01:05:14.638 --> 01:05:15.451
50!

01:05:15.556 --> 01:05:18.058
You tell me that this is his only avenue,
right here, right now, today.

01:05:18.162 --> 01:05:20.316
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

01:05:28.037 --> 01:05:29.661
- We go without.
- Without masks?

01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:31.034
- Jane needs to go.
- Ethan!

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:32.203
We have no choice.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:34.012
Ethan, you'd be walking in
on Moreau unarmed.

01:05:34.116 --> 01:05:35.159
Face-first. Literally.

01:05:35.294 --> 01:05:36.420
How do we know they've met?

01:05:36.545 --> 01:05:38.547
- How do we know they haven't?
- Doesn't matter!

01:05:39.715 --> 01:05:40.996
Damn it.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.581
We have no choice.

01:06:34.102 --> 01:06:35.382
Goggles.

01:06:37.772 --> 01:06:39.315
What if they have met?

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.734
Come in.

01:07:18.646 --> 01:07:20.804
Which one of you is Wistrom?

01:07:21.732 --> 01:07:23.274
Which one of you is Wistrom?

01:07:26.153 --> 01:07:27.434
I am.

01:07:28.989 --> 01:07:30.781
I admire your work.

01:07:46.257 --> 01:07:47.371
Sit.

01:07:56.813 --> 01:07:58.011
Where are my codes?

01:07:59.607 --> 01:08:01.066
Where are my diamonds?

01:08:02.277 --> 01:08:03.475
Close by.

01:08:04.446 --> 01:08:05.726
You have my payment?

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:07.690
When I see the codes.

01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:10.526
Not to worry. Come in!

01:08:11.368 --> 01:08:12.993
I thought we could have tea.

01:08:20.377 --> 01:08:22.666
No diamonds, no codes.

01:08:23.212 --> 01:08:25.502
No codes, no diamonds.

01:08:29.428 --> 01:08:30.470
Kill this one.

01:08:30.595 --> 01:08:32.505
We didn't come alone.

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:34.514
That hallway out there is a kill-box.

01:08:34.725 --> 01:08:35.970
You know who we work for.

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.591
We come back with the codes,
or we don't come back.

01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:41.844
How good is your backup?

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.524
The best.

01:08:46.987 --> 01:08:49.229
<i>I've killed the best.</i>

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.865
Do you care for some sugar?

01:08:56.246 --> 01:08:57.871
<i>Enough. Let's get this done.</i>

01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:00.621
You want payment, I want guarantees.

01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:02.595
When he's authenticated the codes,

01:09:02.701 --> 01:09:05.118
I'll make the call
and you get your diamonds.

01:09:05.255 --> 01:09:06.880
That or

01:09:07.466 --> 01:09:09.423
we all go home in buckets.

01:09:10.426 --> 01:09:12.883
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

01:09:16.682 --> 01:09:17.725
Get the papers.

01:09:32.448 --> 01:09:33.729
Is there a problem?

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:35.731
It's locked.

01:09:39.788 --> 01:09:43.573
Forgive me. There must be a key.

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:46.417
One moment, huh?

01:10:44.227 --> 01:10:48.272
My mistake.
It is a combination, not a key.

01:10:48.857 --> 01:10:50.481
You tell me the numbers.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:57.532
They're good.

01:10:57.741 --> 01:10:58.784
Zero.

01:11:00.452 --> 01:11:01.495
Zero.

01:11:03.371 --> 01:11:04.414
Zero.

01:11:21.556 --> 01:11:22.754
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:06.267 --> 01:12:08.473
It was a pleasure doing business with...

01:12:08.602 --> 01:12:10.725
Wistrom has the launch codes.
He's on the move.

01:12:11.272 --> 01:12:14.723
Hey, I did as you asked. I did.
Now let my family go!

01:12:15.025 --> 01:12:16.401
Release Leonid's family.

01:12:16.527 --> 01:12:17.772
Thank God.

01:12:17.903 --> 01:12:19.279
You can thank him in person.

01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:37.500
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:12:44.471 --> 01:12:45.513
Kill him!

01:12:54.147 --> 01:12:55.262
Moreau's on the move!

01:12:56.316 --> 01:12:57.596
I've got her.

01:12:58.902 --> 01:12:59.939
Jane?

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.081
<i>She's an asset!</i>

01:13:01.279 --> 01:13:02.559
I need her

01:13:02.697 --> 01:13:03.740
alive!

01:13:05.116 --> 01:13:06.231
<i>Acknowledge!</i>

01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:07.994
Acknowledge!

01:13:19.339 --> 01:13:22.790
Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator.
I can't see Leonid, though.

01:13:24.719 --> 01:13:27.803
Benji, slow him down.
Get me an elevator.

01:13:40.193 --> 01:13:41.391
Find Leonid.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:57.209
Benji, I've got a lock on Wistrom.
But I can't tell.

01:13:57.334 --> 01:13:58.959
<i>Is he still in the elevator?</i>

01:14:00.421 --> 01:14:01.463
Benji?

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:06.463
Ethan. Over?

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:07.594
Benji.

01:14:07.699 --> 01:14:08.720
Benji, I lost...

01:14:08.825 --> 01:14:09.596
Ethan, can you hear me?

01:14:09.701 --> 01:14:10.404
Ethan, can you hear me?

01:14:10.509 --> 01:14:11.889
Ethan, can you hear me? Over.

01:14:13.142 --> 01:14:14.256
Jesus!

01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:21.639
Sit down!

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:25.270
- Watch her.
- Why me?

01:14:25.404 --> 01:14:26.863
Because if I do, I'll kill her.

01:14:56.642 --> 01:14:58.931
Hold it, Team Leader.

01:14:59.937 --> 01:15:02.393
Did you really think
I wouldn't catch up with you?

01:15:02.523 --> 01:15:04.480
You and I are not enemies.
It was a set-up...

01:15:04.609 --> 01:15:07.360
We'll find out your lies soon enough.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.983
Move it!

01:15:10.073 --> 01:15:11.615
I'm sorry about this.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:35.889
Leonid. Benji?

01:15:36.507 --> 01:15:37.428
Go for Benji.

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.466
I've got Leonid by the elevators.
He's been shot.

01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:40.613
What?

01:15:51.322 --> 01:15:53.991
Hey, hey. Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:16:13.135 --> 01:16:14.761
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:21.059 --> 01:16:22.637
Jane! No!

01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:25.608
Come on. Come on.

01:22:19.287 --> 01:22:20.799
Now, what happened
with Moreau, Jane?

01:22:20.904 --> 01:22:22.134
She couldn't help us with Hendricks.

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:23.490
So let's throw her off the building!

01:22:23.594 --> 01:22:24.626
I didn't throw her.

01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:25.950
Let's throw her off the building!

01:22:26.055 --> 01:22:28.208
She was not the mission, Jane!

01:22:28.338 --> 01:22:33.249
The mission was to track the file
back to Hendricks, who is in the wind

01:22:33.385 --> 01:22:35.461
with nuclear launch codes!

01:22:35.595 --> 01:22:38.347
Maybe you didn't notice the gun
she had pointed at me.

01:22:38.473 --> 01:22:40.631
Yeah, like you didn't notice
the open window,

01:22:40.766 --> 01:22:42.593
or that we're about a mile up in the air!

01:22:42.726 --> 01:22:44.304
It was an instinctive move.

01:22:44.437 --> 01:22:45.474
It doesn't matter!

01:22:45.578 --> 01:22:47.306
We're talking about a nuclear war.

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:49.895
The asset is more important than you.

01:22:50.025 --> 01:22:52.314
Where do you get off telling me
how well I executed?

01:22:52.445 --> 01:22:53.643
We inherited you.

01:22:54.321 --> 01:22:56.231
You're just a bureaucrat!

01:22:56.365 --> 01:22:58.737
Better have good news for me.
Is he here?

01:22:58.868 --> 01:23:01.109
You think I need you to tell me
what the mission is?

01:23:01.245 --> 01:23:03.997
Yeah, I got it. Dunhill lighter.
I'll be there.

01:23:04.123 --> 01:23:05.747
And no one will be following me.

01:23:05.875 --> 01:23:07.618
Just make sure no one's following you.

01:23:07.752 --> 01:23:09.472
And how the hell
did the Russians find us?

01:23:09.576 --> 01:23:11.745
- What are you asking me for?
- Because you're communications!

01:23:11.849 --> 01:23:13.172
You're in charge of covering our tracks.

01:23:13.299 --> 01:23:16.086
You cannot afford to make mistakes
like that now, Benji.

01:23:16.218 --> 01:23:18.512
You're not a technician any more.
You're a field agent.

01:23:18.637 --> 01:23:21.128
And you're just an "analyst."

01:23:21.265 --> 01:23:22.308
Right?

01:23:23.142 --> 01:23:24.257
Right?

01:23:25.603 --> 01:23:27.595
Who are you really, Brandt?

01:23:29.315 --> 01:23:31.142
- What are you asking?
- What am I asking?

01:23:31.275 --> 01:23:32.935
Let me see if I can put it another way.

01:23:40.159 --> 01:23:44.287
How does an agent with skills like that
end up an analyst?

01:23:52.504 --> 01:23:54.627
Well, we all have our secrets.

01:23:56.174 --> 01:23:57.752
Don't we, Ethan?

01:24:02.722 --> 01:24:05.296
You tell me yours, I'll tell you mine.

01:24:25.036 --> 01:24:27.243
I have friends in the region.
Just sit tight.

01:24:27.372 --> 01:24:28.988
I'll send someone to get you out of here.

01:24:29.092 --> 01:24:30.344
What about Hendricks?
What's the plan?

01:24:30.448 --> 01:24:32.913
The plan was for us
to stop him together.

01:24:33.378 --> 01:24:35.501
Well, what are you going to do?

01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:36.668
Change the plan.

01:24:36.772 --> 01:24:38.915
Wait. That's it?

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:41.921
What are you going to do,
go after him alone?

01:24:43.555 --> 01:24:46.639
Would you care to explain yourself,
Agent Brandt?

01:25:50.496 --> 01:25:53.497
I was on a protection detail in Croatia.

01:25:53.624 --> 01:25:56.708
Shadowing the assets,
husband and wife.

01:25:57.836 --> 01:25:59.744
They were never supposed to know
we were there.

01:25:59.849 --> 01:26:02.465
Whole thing's routine, it was a milk run.

01:26:05.134 --> 01:26:06.593
Three days in

01:26:07.804 --> 01:26:11.386
we caught wind that a Serbian hit squad
was after our couple.

01:26:11.516 --> 01:26:14.054
But my team had it under control.

01:26:14.185 --> 01:26:16.094
We knew they were coming.

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:20.982
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I
should warn the couple somehow.

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:23.434
I wanted to find a way to let them know.

01:26:25.822 --> 01:26:28.739
But, you know, orders are orders,
so I didn't.

01:26:33.704 --> 01:26:38.034
One day, the husband decides
to leave the hotel and go for a run,

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:42.117
so I follow him,
and I leave two men with the wife.

01:26:43.756 --> 01:26:47.801
When I get back, my guys are
unconscious and the wife is gone.

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:52.639
Local police found her body
three days later.

01:26:53.766 --> 01:26:55.640
What was left of her, anyway.

01:27:01.357 --> 01:27:03.682
That was my last day in the field.

01:27:04.777 --> 01:27:07.778
I couldn't face another
life-or-death situation after that.

01:27:07.905 --> 01:27:10.442
So what happened to the husband?

01:27:10.574 --> 01:27:11.688
I never saw him again.

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:15.368
Until two days ago in Moscow,

01:27:15.495 --> 01:27:18.200
when the Secretary
introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:25.376
No, that's not what happened.
She left him.

01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:28.210
Yeah, I heard that one, too, Benji.

01:27:28.717 --> 01:27:31.634
But, unfortunately, I was there.

01:27:33.054 --> 01:27:36.803
Just like I was there
when the Secretary got the phone call

01:27:36.933 --> 01:27:41.227
that Ethan was in custody for killing
six Serbian nationals in cold blood.

01:27:41.354 --> 01:27:42.434
An unsanctioned hit.

01:27:42.564 --> 01:27:43.601
Yeah.

01:27:43.706 --> 01:27:45.398
Disavowed.

01:27:54.117 --> 01:27:55.315
The next thing I know,

01:27:56.286 --> 01:27:58.195
I'm on a plane to Dubai,

01:27:59.956 --> 01:28:03.325
wondering the whole time, do I tell him?

01:28:05.587 --> 01:28:07.212
How do I tell him?

01:28:09.508 --> 01:28:11.251
That I'm responsible.

01:28:13.887 --> 01:28:15.002
I could have warned him.

01:28:15.138 --> 01:28:17.094
I should have warned him.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.011
But I didn't.

01:28:22.770 --> 01:28:24.229
And she died.

01:28:30.736 --> 01:28:34.354
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:37.491
I told you I would get him here.
Didn't I say?

01:28:37.618 --> 01:28:38.697
How do I know it's him?

01:28:38.828 --> 01:28:42.244
Yes, it's him.
You trust me, I trust you. Right?

01:28:42.832 --> 01:28:44.242
This is the guy!

01:28:44.375 --> 01:28:46.996
This is the guy, the one I told you about.

01:28:47.128 --> 01:28:49.666
So we can take these things off.

01:28:54.468 --> 01:28:57.303
Sorry. He's a great guy,
but he doesn't know you like I do.

01:28:57.430 --> 01:29:00.430
So, you work for
the American government.

01:29:01.892 --> 01:29:03.351
And you're an arms dealer.

01:29:03.477 --> 01:29:05.766
No, no, no. Sergei. Sergei.

01:29:06.397 --> 01:29:10.395
He's "independent
defence coordinator." Right?

01:29:11.652 --> 01:29:13.561
That you are. Very classy job.

01:29:13.696 --> 01:29:14.739
Listen. He's a friend.

01:29:14.864 --> 01:29:16.358
Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:18.483
No, no. It's okay. You can have them.

01:29:18.617 --> 01:29:21.702
Whatever arrangements you made with
my cousin is between you and him.

01:29:21.829 --> 01:29:24.663
You want something from me, you pay.

01:29:24.789 --> 01:29:29.001
You misunderstand.
I'm not buying. I'm selling.

01:29:29.794 --> 01:29:31.870
You're selling.

01:29:32.005 --> 01:29:33.203
Selling what?

01:29:33.339 --> 01:29:34.668
The future.

01:29:34.799 --> 01:29:37.551
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

01:29:37.677 --> 01:29:39.302
Our countries are on the brink of war.

01:29:39.929 --> 01:29:41.756
War is very good for business.

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:43.384
Nuclear war?

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.903
Go on.

01:29:55.028 --> 01:29:56.937
I'm looking for a man
named Kurt Hendricks.

01:29:57.072 --> 01:29:58.649
You may know him as Cobalt.

01:29:58.782 --> 01:30:01.486
In either case,
I think you know what he wants.

01:30:01.618 --> 01:30:04.239
I'll bet he even tried
to buy it from you at some point.

01:30:05.705 --> 01:30:06.743
Go on.

01:30:06.847 --> 01:30:08.871
He has a case, he has codes.

01:30:09.667 --> 01:30:12.918
But they're worthless
without a tactical satellite.

01:30:13.046 --> 01:30:15.335
I want to know where he'd get it.

01:30:16.049 --> 01:30:19.500
A man with information like that
would be a potential terrorist.

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:22.379
And to your government,

01:30:22.514 --> 01:30:26.558
a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

01:30:29.561 --> 01:30:30.604
If you help me,

01:30:31.897 --> 01:30:34.851
my friends become your friends.

01:30:38.028 --> 01:30:39.143
Sorry.

01:30:40.489 --> 01:30:42.113
I cannot help you.

01:30:47.663 --> 01:30:50.664
I certainly cannot tell you
that Russia quietly sold

01:30:50.791 --> 01:30:54.539
an obsolete tactical satellite
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

01:30:56.422 --> 01:30:58.295
And whoever gave them that idea?

01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.174
An enterprising third party.

01:31:02.302 --> 01:31:03.761
Working on commission.

01:31:03.887 --> 01:31:07.091
Helping old friends. Making new ones.

01:31:07.808 --> 01:31:09.136
Can the satellite be shut down?

01:31:09.268 --> 01:31:11.141
That would take special skills,

01:31:12.104 --> 01:31:13.563
and you cannot do it alone.

01:31:39.964 --> 01:31:41.542
What's in the bags?

01:31:41.674 --> 01:31:43.003
It's our gear.

01:31:43.134 --> 01:31:44.877
How'd you get it?

01:31:45.011 --> 01:31:46.125
Made a friend.

01:31:47.305 --> 01:31:48.514
Well, I'm glad we could help.

01:31:48.639 --> 01:31:50.383
You could help now.

01:31:50.516 --> 01:31:52.343
Look, Ethan, before we...

01:31:52.477 --> 01:31:53.675
Whatever happened, happened.

01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:57.023
We still have a chance to clean this up,
but we have to do it now.

01:31:58.024 --> 01:32:00.182
And we have to do it together.

01:32:07.492 --> 01:32:08.820
Okay. So, where are we going?

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:11.662
India.

01:32:15.124 --> 01:32:16.618
- India? India?
- Sure.

01:32:16.751 --> 01:32:17.794
Okay. Great.

01:32:21.506 --> 01:32:22.964
Love the jet.

01:32:23.716 --> 01:32:25.460
Wait till you see the car.

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:33.142
Sidorov.

01:32:33.309 --> 01:32:34.803
<i>How have you been, old friend?</i>

01:32:35.019 --> 01:32:36.098
Oh, it's you.

01:32:37.105 --> 01:32:40.224
I've been busy with other things.

01:32:40.358 --> 01:32:42.267
<i>But I'll be after you again soon enough.</i>

01:32:44.861 --> 01:32:47.696
I understand you're looking for an American...

01:32:47.906 --> 01:32:48.949
I am.

01:32:50.033 --> 01:32:53.485
You're also looking for a nuclear launch device
stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.

01:32:53.589 --> 01:32:56.925
<i>You're also looking for a nuclear launch device</i>
<i>stolen from the Kremlin two days ago.</i>

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.796
I am?

01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:59.866
I can help you find both.

01:33:00.877 --> 01:33:03.795
If... we can come to an understanding.

01:33:09.970 --> 01:33:11.132
Brij Nath.

01:33:11.263 --> 01:33:13.718
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

01:33:13.849 --> 01:33:16.766
On the surface,
his entire network is state-of-the-art.

01:33:16.893 --> 01:33:18.767
But it's built on illegally acquired

01:33:18.895 --> 01:33:22.727
Cold War cast-offs, including this,
the Novosti satellite.

01:33:22.858 --> 01:33:24.703
Hendricks needs it
to launch a nuclear strike,

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:27.190
and we have to shut it down
before he gets that chance.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.858
And to do that, we need to get
the access code from him.

01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:31.270
One way or another.

01:33:32.576 --> 01:33:34.070
And if I don't,

01:33:35.078 --> 01:33:36.572
none of this works.

01:33:37.914 --> 01:33:38.994
You can do this.

01:33:39.124 --> 01:33:40.203
Yeah.

01:33:41.084 --> 01:33:43.836
A week ago, I would have believed you.

01:33:49.092 --> 01:33:51.463
I don't blame you for what happened.

01:33:56.265 --> 01:33:59.883
She took someone you cared about.
That's not something you just

01:34:00.352 --> 01:34:01.395
let go.

01:34:03.105 --> 01:34:05.181
Did it make you feel better?

01:34:07.735 --> 01:34:10.605
When you killed the men
who killed your wife?

01:34:18.746 --> 01:34:20.573
We can't get them back.

01:34:27.004 --> 01:34:28.308
Okay, to shut down the satellite,

01:34:28.412 --> 01:34:31.090
we have to manually tap into
the central server.

01:34:31.217 --> 01:34:34.799
You'll enter through the exhaust vent,
wearing this under your suit.

01:34:34.929 --> 01:34:37.502
Drop down into the computer array,
and I'll catch you,

01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.925
then move you along the relay room
and you jack into the panel.

01:34:44.647 --> 01:34:47.185
Okay, so we enter the party
separately as guests.

01:34:47.316 --> 01:34:49.060
Ethan quarterbacks while Jane...

01:34:49.193 --> 01:34:50.684
Gets the codes from the billionaire.

01:34:50.788 --> 01:34:52.936
I switch off the fan,
you jump into the computer array,

01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:54.898
and I catch you,
you plug in the transmitter

01:34:55.032 --> 01:34:58.649
then Ethan feeds me the codes which I
then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

01:34:58.785 --> 01:35:01.905
Okay, but you just breezed over
something I think is really important.

01:35:02.038 --> 01:35:04.825
The computer array part, where I just...

01:35:05.917 --> 01:35:06.960
Jump?

01:35:07.794 --> 01:35:09.372
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

01:35:09.504 --> 01:35:11.212
I don't... Why is that so hard to grasp?

01:35:11.923 --> 01:35:12.961
Well...

01:35:13.065 --> 01:35:17.711
Why? It's a 25-foot drop.
And we're using magnets.

01:35:17.846 --> 01:35:19.126
Yeah.

01:35:19.931 --> 01:35:22.967
In light of our recent efforts,
the technology's...

01:35:23.101 --> 01:35:25.010
The science is sound. All right?

01:35:25.145 --> 01:35:26.722
I'd be more worried about the heat.

01:35:28.064 --> 01:35:30.140
And then there's that. What heat?

01:35:30.984 --> 01:35:32.391
Well, it's like any computer, isn't it?

01:35:32.496 --> 01:35:35.231
If you switch off the fan,
it's gonna get really hot!

01:35:35.363 --> 01:35:36.406
Of course.

01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:38.109
Relatively, you know.

01:35:39.659 --> 01:35:43.110
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a...

01:35:44.581 --> 01:35:47.498
An oven, essentially.

01:35:48.168 --> 01:35:49.792
Yeah. Essentially.

01:35:50.170 --> 01:35:52.293
But I'll catch you.

01:35:54.215 --> 01:35:55.330
Great.

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:26.533
<i>Aapka swagat hai,</i> sir. Welcome, sir.

01:37:18.256 --> 01:37:19.584
Comm check.

01:37:20.299 --> 01:37:22.969
Saturn's got your five-by-five, Jupiter.

01:37:24.637 --> 01:37:26.096
This is Pluto.

01:37:28.307 --> 01:37:30.347
I have arrived at the party.

01:37:33.813 --> 01:37:34.856
There he is.

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.612
Get us that code.

01:37:57.336 --> 01:37:59.080
Venus moving in on target.

01:38:10.975 --> 01:38:12.256
Hook's in.

01:38:14.353 --> 01:38:16.311
You do make an impression.

01:38:20.275 --> 01:38:21.318
Why am I Pluto?

01:38:21.443 --> 01:38:23.234
<i>It's not even a planet any more.</i>

01:38:23.361 --> 01:38:25.069
Well, I think Uranus is available.

01:38:25.197 --> 01:38:27.438
It's funny 'cause you said "anus."

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.923
I'm in position.

01:38:43.465 --> 01:38:45.208
Sending in the Rover.

01:38:49.888 --> 01:38:51.051
He's moving to you.

01:38:51.181 --> 01:38:52.841
<i>Give him your back.</i>

01:38:53.767 --> 01:38:55.529
<i>Don't want to make it too easy for him.</i>

01:38:55.633 --> 01:38:57.145
Are you gonna be talking
the whole time?

01:38:58.146 --> 01:39:01.480
In 20 minutes, I want a glass of
CuvÃ©e Louis in every guest's hand.

01:39:01.608 --> 01:39:04.705
And make sure all of them have a bottle
to take home by the end of the night.

01:39:04.809 --> 01:39:05.852
Sure.

01:39:09.408 --> 01:39:10.570
Impressed yet?

01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:13.404
I'm more of a bourbon girl.

01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:20.705
I'm Brij Nath.

01:39:21.253 --> 01:39:23.245
Welcome to my humble home.

01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:47.402
<i>And Rover's in position.</i>

01:39:48.779 --> 01:39:49.942
Spinning down the turbine.

01:39:58.164 --> 01:39:59.206
<i>He's e-mailing.</i>

01:39:59.874 --> 01:40:01.332
Venus. Be Venus.

01:40:01.459 --> 01:40:02.739
<i>Be Venus.</i>

01:40:11.093 --> 01:40:12.256
Husband?

01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:14.013
Boyfriend?

01:40:15.014 --> 01:40:16.294
More of a

01:40:17.266 --> 01:40:18.309
co-worker.

01:40:19.101 --> 01:40:21.058
Saturn, take the leap.

01:40:25.691 --> 01:40:26.770
Okay.

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.190
Jumping.

01:40:32.323 --> 01:40:33.946
Jumping now.

01:40:36.326 --> 01:40:37.363
Jump now?

01:40:37.468 --> 01:40:39.445
Yes. Commit. Jump.

01:40:39.788 --> 01:40:41.412
- Jump.
- Jump.

01:40:41.539 --> 01:40:43.413
- And I catch you.
- Now.

01:40:47.003 --> 01:40:50.087
So, you're sure
about this suit, right, Benji?

01:40:50.215 --> 01:40:51.257
Pretty sure.

01:40:52.008 --> 01:40:54.760
Now you're pretty sure?

01:40:55.887 --> 01:40:56.930
Jump.

01:40:58.014 --> 01:41:00.137
Oh, God. All right.

01:41:01.184 --> 01:41:02.227
Jump.

01:41:03.603 --> 01:41:04.646
Jump!

01:41:22.747 --> 01:41:25.203
<i>Jupiter, he's gone.</i>

01:41:29.712 --> 01:41:30.750
Did you jump?

01:41:30.854 --> 01:41:32.665
Should I not have jumped?

01:41:33.717 --> 01:41:34.759
'Cause I jumped!

01:41:37.011 --> 01:41:38.256
Stand by.

01:41:46.311 --> 01:41:47.770
I'm playing a hunch.

01:41:48.897 --> 01:41:50.308
Don't hit me.

01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:08.792
Hello?

01:42:08.959 --> 01:42:10.584
My God, you are

01:42:10.711 --> 01:42:12.787
<i>a passionate creature.</i>

01:42:14.757 --> 01:42:17.674
I would like to show you
my collection of art.

01:42:18.385 --> 01:42:20.177
I was waiting for you to ask.

01:42:20.304 --> 01:42:22.012
Then you have to find me.

01:42:22.139 --> 01:42:23.302
You're on.

01:42:23.432 --> 01:42:25.555
I'm heading upstairs.

01:42:43.410 --> 01:42:44.869
<i>All right, now be careful,</i>

01:42:44.995 --> 01:42:47.153
<i>because it's probably getting a bit hot.</i>

01:42:47.288 --> 01:42:49.779
<i>We have to get to that satellite</i>
<i>before Hendricks does.</i>

01:43:04.639 --> 01:43:07.344
<i>Look left. Look up.</i>

01:43:07.475 --> 01:43:10.096
<i>I find your capricious passion intriguing.</i>

01:43:11.479 --> 01:43:13.602
<i>Let me tell you one thing.</i>
<i>He's not your type.</i>

01:43:13.731 --> 01:43:16.934
<i>Completely not your type.</i>
<i>He's completely cold. I'm hot.</i>

01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:21.395
<i>Like all Indian men, I'm very hot.</i>

01:43:21.531 --> 01:43:22.568
Eight o'clock.

01:43:22.672 --> 01:43:23.699
<i>Hot! Very hot.</i>

01:43:23.804 --> 01:43:25.526
He's at your eight o'clock.

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:27.949
<i>As you move towards me,</i>
<i>you're getting hotter.</i>

01:43:28.996 --> 01:43:31.867
Whoa. Up, up! Up, up!

01:43:31.999 --> 01:43:34.407
Too much, too much, too much!

01:43:39.006 --> 01:43:40.287
I see you.

01:43:42.051 --> 01:43:45.551
I'd heard you have one of the finest
private collections in the world.

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.218
Well, at the very least, it's private.

01:44:07.367 --> 01:44:09.276
Saturn? How we doing
in the relay room?

01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:10.454
In position.

01:44:12.789 --> 01:44:14.070
I see the satellite.

01:44:20.922 --> 01:44:22.120
Can I help you, gentlemen?

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:23.799
I don't think so.

01:44:30.223 --> 01:44:31.682
Need those codes, guys.

01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:43.563
All originals from Chatarpur District.

01:44:46.948 --> 01:44:49.107
You know, the Tantrics believe

01:44:50.744 --> 01:44:55.453
that the <i>Swadhisthana</i> chakra hides
our most subconscious of desires.

01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:51.334
Uplink to satellite.
Reboot to original military specs.

01:45:51.721 --> 01:45:53.428
Download the virus.

01:46:01.313 --> 01:46:02.558
What the hell is that?

01:46:04.483 --> 01:46:05.526
What the hell is that?

01:46:05.651 --> 01:46:06.694
What the hell is what?

01:46:06.819 --> 01:46:08.016
It's going haywire!

01:46:08.153 --> 01:46:10.026
It's downloaded a virus
from the satellite.

01:46:10.155 --> 01:46:11.395
Hendricks is killing the server

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.025
<i>before we can kill the satellite.</i>

01:46:13.158 --> 01:46:15.197
Hendricks is reprogramming
the satellite.

01:46:15.326 --> 01:46:18.363
<i>He's gonna have launch</i>
<i>capability in five minutes!</i>

01:46:18.496 --> 01:46:20.405
- Something wrong?
- No.

01:46:21.124 --> 01:46:23.247
Jane, you gotta move.
We need that code.

01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:25.203
Finally we're alone.

01:46:33.011 --> 01:46:35.383
Venus, now's the time. Kick his ass

01:46:35.513 --> 01:46:37.138
<i>and get the code.</i>

01:46:37.515 --> 01:46:40.635
We are alone, aren't we?

01:46:41.352 --> 01:46:43.974
No one will interrupt us.

01:46:48.359 --> 01:46:49.984
Move and I break your neck.

01:46:50.111 --> 01:46:52.649
The override sequence
for the relay station.

01:46:52.781 --> 01:46:55.022
Say it now or never speak again.

01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:57.238
The codes.

01:46:58.536 --> 01:47:00.778
<i>46, 82,</i>

01:47:01.706 --> 01:47:03.165
<i>93.</i>

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:07.123
Benji, what happened?

01:47:07.227 --> 01:47:08.920
The system's crashed! We're too late.

01:47:09.047 --> 01:47:10.624
<i>No, no, no. He's revealed himself.</i>

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.592
Benji, can you pinpoint
Hendricks' location?

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:15.585
Hendricks is signalling out of a state-run

01:47:15.719 --> 01:47:17.546
<i>TV-station 6.7 miles from here.</i>

01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:18.717
Send me the coordinates.

01:47:18.821 --> 01:47:20.651
Good work, Brandt.
Now get the hell out of there.

01:47:20.755 --> 01:47:21.710
Back me up!

01:47:21.814 --> 01:47:24.144
Jane, tie it off with Nath
and meet me at the rally point.

01:47:29.733 --> 01:47:30.776
Sleep tight

01:47:32.069 --> 01:47:33.896
Faster, Benji! Just straight through!

01:47:38.075 --> 01:47:39.403
Wait! Stop!

01:47:39.535 --> 01:47:40.993
<i>Take me through!</i>

01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:44.074
<i>It's not responding! A little bit of</i>
<i>patience would be appreciated!</i>

01:47:59.805 --> 01:48:01.632
I can't reach the top!

01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:05.427
More fan! More fan!

01:48:05.561 --> 01:48:06.889
<i>More fan!</i>

01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:08.847
There's nothing I can do! It's maxed out!

01:48:26.289 --> 01:48:27.451
<i>Brandt?</i>

01:48:27.582 --> 01:48:28.744
<i>Brandt?</i>

01:48:30.334 --> 01:48:33.620
Next time, I get to seduce the rich guy.

01:48:44.474 --> 01:48:46.680
Satellite weaponised and online.

01:48:46.809 --> 01:48:49.135
Upload the new authentication codes.

01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:51.230
Lock Russian Central Command
out of the system.

01:48:51.647 --> 01:48:53.023
Isolate the sub.

01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:57.775
We'll fire just one missile,
an apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

01:48:58.321 --> 01:49:00.064
That should start the ball rolling.

01:49:00.198 --> 01:49:01.240
<i>I'm here, Ethan.</i>

01:49:01.365 --> 01:49:03.405
How long until Hendricks
can launch a missile?

01:49:04.410 --> 01:49:05.821
Less than 30 seconds!

01:49:07.538 --> 01:49:09.365
We need another route.

01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:12.502
Turn left up ahead,
take the alley on the right.

01:49:27.433 --> 01:49:28.476
We have uplink.

01:49:39.152 --> 01:49:41.690
Ethan, Hendricks
has started the launch sequence.

01:49:41.822 --> 01:49:43.480
How much time until missiles are flying?

01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:44.771
<i>Three minutes!</i>

01:49:48.578 --> 01:49:50.038
We're three and a half minutes out.

01:49:53.542 --> 01:49:54.584
We can make it.

01:49:56.378 --> 01:49:57.421
We can make it.

01:50:03.969 --> 01:50:05.011
Captain...

01:50:09.766 --> 01:50:12.222
Connect to Central Command
for launch verification.

01:50:12.352 --> 01:50:13.395
Right away.

01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:17.899
Proceed with operation "Iron Fist".

01:50:18.108 --> 01:50:19.851
<i>Command to Launch is confirmed.</i>

01:50:20.277 --> 01:50:22.186
Cease all further communication.

01:50:22.404 --> 01:50:23.447
<i>Over and out.</i>

01:50:25.824 --> 01:50:26.987
Next left.

01:50:40.504 --> 01:50:41.547
Proceed.

01:51:02.818 --> 01:51:04.977
Ethan? We're too late.

01:51:05.112 --> 01:51:07.069
<i>The missile's in the air.</i>

01:51:19.502 --> 01:51:21.264
There has to be a way
to abort the warhead.

01:51:21.368 --> 01:51:23.182
If there is one,
it'll be on the launch device.

01:51:23.287 --> 01:51:24.500
We're gonna get that case.

01:51:35.226 --> 01:51:37.764
May there be peace on Earth.

01:51:42.817 --> 01:51:44.393
Disable the relay.

01:51:45.819 --> 01:51:47.858
Get Wistrom! Inside, inside!

01:52:22.397 --> 01:52:24.224
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

01:52:24.357 --> 01:52:25.932
Ethan went after Hendricks
and the case, but...

01:52:26.036 --> 01:52:28.267
Doesn't matter if he has the case.
We can't transmit the abort codes.

01:52:28.372 --> 01:52:29.279
Can you fix it?

01:52:29.383 --> 01:52:31.906
Yeah... It's gonna be pointless
if we don't have any power.

01:52:32.031 --> 01:52:33.074
Wistrom!

01:52:35.118 --> 01:52:36.742
- Jane!
- I'm okay.

01:52:38.538 --> 01:52:40.780
No, you are not okay. She's hit.

01:52:41.249 --> 01:52:42.791
You stay here and cover Benji.

01:52:42.917 --> 01:52:45.871
Benji, get this thing rewired
and back online. I'll get the power on.

01:52:46.004 --> 01:52:47.498
We can do this.

01:56:01.947 --> 01:56:04.698
I'm taking that briefcase!

01:56:08.286 --> 01:56:09.745
No! No!

01:56:57.084 --> 01:56:58.495
He's been gone too long.

01:56:58.627 --> 01:57:00.038
Damn it! Listen.

01:57:00.171 --> 01:57:03.088
When the power comes on,
these two drives go into this bay, okay?

01:57:47.133 --> 01:57:49.707
Mission accomplished!

01:58:31.218 --> 01:58:32.416
Don't touch him!

01:58:39.143 --> 01:58:40.934
This one is mine.

01:58:53.115 --> 01:58:55.867
So, we are not enemies.

01:58:57.828 --> 01:59:00.497
The phone call
from that arms dealer in Dubai.

01:59:00.831 --> 01:59:02.373
You wanted me to find you.

01:59:06.462 --> 01:59:08.454
How else to believe this?

01:59:16.138 --> 01:59:17.181
Hospital?

01:59:19.391 --> 01:59:21.431
<i>And in other news, eight weeks later,</i>

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.387
<i>the debate continues.</i>

01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:27.518
<i>Eyewitnesses remain adamant</i>
<i>that the object was some sort of aircraft,</i>

01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:31.433
<i>but officials with the Department of</i>
<i>Defence insist it was simply a meteor</i>

01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:34.238
<i>large enough to be</i>
<i>visible during daylight.</i>

01:59:34.530 --> 01:59:36.404
You actually said that.

01:59:36.783 --> 01:59:38.028
Out loud.

01:59:38.701 --> 01:59:40.077
"Mission accomplished."

01:59:40.203 --> 01:59:41.240
I said it.

01:59:41.344 --> 01:59:43.820
You're still corny, Ethan.

01:59:43.956 --> 01:59:46.744
I can't imagine
the look on that guy's face.

01:59:48.586 --> 01:59:50.579
- Hey.
- This must be them.

01:59:50.713 --> 01:59:53.963
Luther Stickell,
the firm of Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

01:59:55.635 --> 01:59:59.419
I blew an entire weekend
on the bottom of the San Francisco Bay

02:00:00.598 --> 02:00:02.507
no thanks to you clowns.

02:00:04.894 --> 02:00:06.436
No, man, you know I got this.

02:00:07.480 --> 02:00:09.888
I know. I'll see you in Kandahar.

02:00:13.736 --> 02:00:15.812
Thanks for meeting me.

02:00:15.947 --> 02:00:18.189
So, I hear the insurance
company's refusing

02:00:18.324 --> 02:00:20.483
to pay the claim
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

02:00:20.618 --> 02:00:24.201
Something about intentional 100-metre
vertical drops not being covered.

02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:25.445
Go figure.

02:00:29.085 --> 02:00:30.663
How's the leg?

02:00:30.795 --> 02:00:31.993
Still working.

02:00:33.005 --> 02:00:34.048
You?

02:00:34.424 --> 02:00:35.622
Healing.

02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:38.625
I'm fine, by the way.

02:00:40.011 --> 02:00:41.763
I mean, I'm not actually sleeping, per se.

02:00:41.972 --> 02:00:44.759
You know. Cold sweats.
Middle of the night.

02:00:46.476 --> 02:00:49.014
All these people
are just happy and smiling

02:00:49.146 --> 02:00:50.950
and they are completely
oblivious to the fact

02:00:51.054 --> 02:00:53.020
that they were almost vaporised.

02:00:54.151 --> 02:00:55.728
And if it hadn't been for...

02:00:55.861 --> 02:00:57.141
Dumb luck?

02:00:57.654 --> 02:00:58.733
Was it?

02:01:00.115 --> 02:01:03.566
I mean, look,
we were unprepared, in the dark.

02:01:04.119 --> 02:01:05.399
Disavowed.

02:01:06.663 --> 02:01:08.457
And the only thing
that functioned properly

02:01:09.374 --> 02:01:10.868
on that mission

02:01:11.877 --> 02:01:13.335
was this team.

02:01:15.422 --> 02:01:17.995
I don't know how we ended up together,

02:01:19.801 --> 02:01:21.177
but I'm glad we did.

02:01:28.727 --> 02:01:29.842
Your missions.

02:01:30.854 --> 02:01:32.681
Choose to accept them.

02:01:38.278 --> 02:01:39.903
Hey, look, I'm in.

02:01:40.322 --> 02:01:41.865
Seriously. It's not as if any mission

02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:44.066
is gonna be rougher
than the last one, is it?

02:01:45.535 --> 02:01:46.779
I mean, that's just...

02:01:46.911 --> 02:01:48.488
Bomb... Is it?

02:02:06.931 --> 02:02:08.211
Thanks, Ethan.

02:02:08.557 --> 02:02:09.720
Thank you.

02:02:11.685 --> 02:02:12.723
Agent Hunt.

02:02:12.827 --> 02:02:14.140
Agent Carter.

02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:23.823
Brandt.

02:02:27.493 --> 02:02:29.026
I'm not picking up that phone, Ethan,

02:02:29.130 --> 02:02:31.658
because I don't think
you want me in the field.

02:02:34.667 --> 02:02:36.576
I know your wife is dead.

02:02:38.796 --> 02:02:40.954
I was there in Croatia.

02:02:42.758 --> 02:02:44.169
I was there for one reason.

02:02:44.301 --> 02:02:45.416
One.

02:02:46.262 --> 02:02:47.673
And I failed.

02:02:52.268 --> 02:02:53.809
It was my job to protect her.

02:02:54.561 --> 02:02:55.971
How do you know she's dead?

02:02:59.399 --> 02:03:00.442
There was a body.

02:03:00.942 --> 02:03:02.105
Did you see it?

02:03:05.864 --> 02:03:07.856
You killed those Serbians.

02:03:07.991 --> 02:03:09.034
I had to get her back.

02:03:09.159 --> 02:03:10.653
You were sent to Rankow Prison.

02:03:10.785 --> 02:03:12.568
That was a sacrifice
I was willing to make.

02:03:12.673 --> 02:03:15.414
IMF suspected Hendricks
had people in Rankow.

02:03:18.168 --> 02:03:20.789
And six dead Serbians
was the ideal cover.

02:03:22.672 --> 02:03:24.464
Waste not, want not.

02:03:41.524 --> 02:03:43.600
The Secretary never told me.

02:03:46.946 --> 02:03:50.730
I accepted the Rankow Prison mission
on one condition:

02:03:50.867 --> 02:03:53.025
That no one could know
she was still alive.

02:03:54.662 --> 02:03:56.904
But you're telling me.

02:04:05.047 --> 02:04:07.538
When did you find out
that I was in Croatia?

02:04:08.258 --> 02:04:10.168
I pulled your file after India.

02:04:11.095 --> 02:04:12.257
Right.

02:04:14.264 --> 02:04:16.755
So you had to fake your wife's death.

02:04:17.887 --> 02:04:20.976
As long as we were together,
she could never be safe.

02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:24.732
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

02:04:27.277 --> 02:04:28.475
It's mine.

02:04:30.933 --> 02:04:31.976
Okay.

02:04:35.786 --> 02:04:37.031
So we're good.

02:04:38.372 --> 02:04:39.700
We're good.

02:05:39.432 --> 02:05:41.140
Come on!

02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:02.421
<i>Good evening, Mr Hunt.</i>

02:06:02.630 --> 02:06:06.570
<i>36 hours ago, there was a breach</i>
<i>in our military's communication network.</i>

02:06:06.755 --> 02:06:10.203
<i>Now, an emerging terror</i>
<i>organisation known as The Syndicate</i>

02:06:10.338 --> 02:06:14.077
<i>has control of our entire drone fleet.</i>
<i>Their targets: Unknown.</i>

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:16.968
