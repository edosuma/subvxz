WEBVTT

02:02.205 --> 02:12.840
Mr. Horne?

02:16.386 --> 02:19.012
Your secretary said to come in.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.014
Bobby Briggs.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.767
Bobby, you know
what you have to have in this life?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.310
Hmm?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.480
Balance.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.483
Distance.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.403
Symmetry.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.286
Look.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.540
It's a beautiful thing, isn't it? Hmm?

02:50.545 --> 02:54.756
Uh, Mr. Horne, did you listen
to that tape that I sent you?

02:54.924 --> 02:56.758
Yes, I listened to your tape, Bobby.

02:56.968 --> 03:01.597
Frankly, I am surprised
that Leo could master the technology.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.978
Damn it, Bobby,
what do you want? Huh?

03:08.730 --> 03:12.191
Mr. Horne,
I have a great admiration for you.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.569
Admiration is for poets
and dairy cows, Bobby.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.990
I don't know what you mean. I, uh...

03:20.742 --> 03:22.409
Bobby.

03:25.538 --> 03:30.042
You're standing in front
of a mammoth skyscraper.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.837
A leviathan that rips a hole
in the clouds.

03:34.005 --> 03:37.841
Now, what's the first question
that comes to your mind?

03:40.887 --> 03:43.138
Um...

03:45.850 --> 03:49.978
The first question that you ask yourself
is, "What's on the top floor?"

03:50.146 --> 03:53.899
"Who's up there in the penthouse,
and why?"

03:54.359 --> 03:56.485
Now, that's who I am.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.988
Are you?

04:02.533 --> 04:06.078
Yeah, of course I am. Yes.

04:09.916 --> 04:14.586
Bobby, opportunity knocks.

04:17.715 --> 04:23.387
I want you to follow Hank Jennings.

04:23.721 --> 04:27.099
I want you to chronicle
his existence.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.728
Show me something
that I don't already know.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.786
Hmm.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.705
I'd like to see both.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.125
Very good. Which one
would you like to see first?

04:54.419 --> 04:55.919
Well...

05:13.396 --> 05:14.813
What is this?

05:15.773 --> 05:17.649
I'd thought I'd taken that out.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.111
That property
is called Dead Dog Farm.

05:21.279 --> 05:23.822
And it's worse than it sounds.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.199
- What is it?
- A puzzle.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.869
No one ever really stays there long.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.787
When can I see it?

05:35.001 --> 05:36.251
Sorry I'm late.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.879
But the little nipper is so excited
about our camping trip,

05:39.047 --> 05:41.465
I just couldn't coax him
out of the car. Heh.

05:41.632 --> 05:43.300
Richard, this is Judy Swain

05:43.468 --> 05:46.136
from the Happy Helping Hands
organization.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.804
I'm little Nicky's case manager.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.599
Charmed, I'm sure. Shall we?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.809
Sit down.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.853
Okay. Ahem.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.104
Um...

05:56.272 --> 05:59.649
As I was about to tell your,
uh, friends,

05:59.817 --> 06:02.861
the number one thing
to know about Nicky

06:03.029 --> 06:08.533
is that throughout his brief life,
he has been very confused,

06:08.701 --> 06:14.289
and perhaps traumatized
by a persistent random misfortune.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.876
Looks like he's bounced around
quite a bit.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.336
Well, yes, he has.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.630
- Poor child.
- Yes.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.173
An orphan, you know.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.759
Really? What happened?
Did his parents die?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.304
Nicely deduced, Andrew.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.765
Persistent random misfortune?

06:32.141 --> 06:33.975
Uh, they were killed.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.895
How were they killed, Miss Swain?

06:37.271 --> 06:38.980
Mysterious circumstances.

06:39.148 --> 06:43.318
I'm afraid the, uh, orphanage has never
provided us with that information.

06:44.195 --> 06:47.948
Andy, let's go.
Emergency up at the Great Northern.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.591
Looks like a heart attack.

07:07.051 --> 07:11.096
Once stimulated,
the female will respond in such a way

07:11.264 --> 07:14.891
that the skin around her...
Oh, my God.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.769
Looks like Dougie went out
with his boots on.

07:18.312 --> 07:22.816
Love Poems of Lord Byron,
The Kama Sutra,

07:23.401 --> 07:25.068
Hookers and Handmaidens.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.362
Sheriff, look at this.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.121
What a falling out was here.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.047
Doug.

07:47.508 --> 07:52.220
Lord, I hate to say it, I told you so.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.607
Here, sheriff.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.110
This is it.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.404
The murder weapon.

08:10.198 --> 08:14.159
She might as well
have blown his brains out with a rifle.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.837
He never could say no to a woman.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.388
You old fool.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.908
You sexual adventuress,
you'll burn in hell for this.

08:55.076 --> 08:59.454
- Take it easy, mister.
- I'm gonna shout till I wake the dead.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.957
She murdered my brother.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.876
She's a witch.

09:05.628 --> 09:09.005
He's right, I'm cursed.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.507
Don't be silly.

09:10.675 --> 09:14.302
No, no, it's true.

09:14.845 --> 09:19.683
It all started in high school,
prom night.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.811
My date went to kiss me.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.565
It was his first day
with his new braces.

09:26.732 --> 09:30.110
Oh, and they gleamed
in the moonlight.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.824
And his rubber band snapped
and his jaw locked open,

09:35.992 --> 09:38.451
and we ended up
in the emergency room,

09:38.619 --> 09:42.122
and the doctors had to break his jaw
in three places to get it to shut.

09:42.290 --> 09:47.085
And it's just gotten worse ever since.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.087
A curse needs a cure.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.840
I know a bit about these things.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.342
Are you the sheriff?

09:55.595 --> 10:01.558
Let's just say, when something
really big goes down, I'm the man.

10:07.440 --> 10:12.068
Boys, there's a story
about a great football coach,

10:12.236 --> 10:14.654
whose name escapes me
at this time,

10:14.822 --> 10:19.159
who was dead set against
having any black players on his team.

10:19.327 --> 10:24.748
Until somebody brought him the finest
black halfback anyone had ever seen.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.626
And when what's-his-name
saw him run 50 yards

10:27.793 --> 10:29.419
and no one lay a hand on him,

10:29.587 --> 10:33.173
he shouted, "Look at that Indian go!"

10:33.341 --> 10:38.178
That coach accepted
that athlete's desire to compete.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.305
Nadine.

10:41.349 --> 10:45.060
And today, this story applies
to this woman's...

10:45.227 --> 10:48.271
This young girl's right to compete.

10:48.439 --> 10:53.026
In addition to it being her moral
and constitutional right.

10:54.070 --> 10:57.739
Mike Nelson,
could you step up here for a second?

11:00.701 --> 11:02.661
Come on, Mike, go.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.122
Now, Nadine has chosen
to prove herself to us

11:06.290 --> 11:09.209
by taking on our very best.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.796
Our very own district champion,
Mike Nelson.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.965
- Yeah! Come on. Come on.
- All right, man.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.218
Go, Mike.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.178
Hi, Mike.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.682
- Oh!
- Put your hand here.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.392
No, here.

11:25.559 --> 11:28.269
All right, now just push against me.
I'll try not to hurt you.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.729
Wanna go out tonight?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.940
This is called a tie.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.072
- Oh, yeah.
- You stupid...

11:39.281 --> 11:40.615
What did you say, Mike?

11:47.415 --> 11:48.665
Neck, you're breaking my neck.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.834
You're right,
this is sort of like necking.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.210
Agh.

11:53.838 --> 11:57.132
What about tonight?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.385
Coach?

12:02.847 --> 12:03.972
Hey, coach?

12:09.395 --> 12:12.605
- Get up, Mike.
- Oh, my God.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.067
One, two and three.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.695
Now will you go out with me?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.130
What happened to you?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.591
I got beat up by a girl.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.011
What did you do to her?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.805
Donna, I'm not kidding.
Now, you've gotta help me.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.475
It's bad enough getting stomped on
in front of the whole team,

12:48.642 --> 12:49.893
but she likes me.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.811
- Who?
- Mrs. Hurley.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.689
Nadine?

12:55.649 --> 12:56.691
It's not funny.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.360
I don't know, maybe an older woman
is just what you need.

12:59.528 --> 13:02.363
I don't wanna go out with anyone
who can body-slam me.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.407
Well, what do you want me
to do about it?

13:04.575 --> 13:08.203
I don't know, talk to her or something.
Pretend you're still my girlfriend.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.205
Sorry, Mike,
I'm not that good of an actress.

13:10.372 --> 13:14.083
Donna, this is serious.
I'm gonna end up in traction.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.931
May I help you?

13:28.140 --> 13:30.266
Hang up a local service rebellion,

13:30.434 --> 13:34.354
wonder if you'd help me bundle up
loose sticks and burn that master.

13:34.522 --> 13:39.108
Malcolm, Malcolm Sloan,
as in brother to Evelyn.

13:39.276 --> 13:42.612
Mr. Marsh's driver, as in,
"Bring that car around, James."

13:42.822 --> 13:44.906
So how badly
did she damage the Jag?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.366
It's repairable.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.829
That's the nice thing about things.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.250
You know, when she and Jeffrey
fell in love,

13:55.417 --> 13:57.168
he gave her a whole new life.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.254
That's for sure.

14:00.756 --> 14:05.635
Now I got a nice uniform,
and the keys to the liquor cabinet.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.181
God, I hope
I don't sound ungrateful,

14:10.349 --> 14:12.642
because compared
to the life I was living,

14:12.810 --> 14:15.770
wanton dissipation is a step up.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.730
And Evelyn,
she learned a lot herself.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.484
Defensive postures,
masking bruises, vicious cycles.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.403
What are you talking about?

14:24.071 --> 14:26.781
I'm sorry, am I being obscure?

14:27.241 --> 14:29.951
Once a fortnight,
Jeffrey pounds her mercilessly,

14:30.119 --> 14:33.872
and she tries to get even
by breaking one of his things.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.749
It only perpetuates the cycle.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.252
She's your sister.
Why don't you stop him?

14:41.755 --> 14:45.091
Sonny boy,
nobody stops Mr. Marsh.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.469
That's a golden rule around here.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.014
You can jot that down
and put it under your pillow.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.476
I gotta get back.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.814
Hey, thanks.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.317
I mean that.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.643
Well, it's still standing.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.811
Almost by force of habit.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.440
Well, habit can provide
a strong foundation.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.400
Dead Dog Farm, huh?

15:44.568 --> 15:47.695
That's an old legend.
Of all the people in the world,

15:47.863 --> 15:50.907
the best and the worst
are drawn to Dead Dog,

15:51.075 --> 15:52.951
and most turn away.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.162
Only those with the purest of heart
can feel its pain.

15:56.330 --> 16:01.417
And somewhere in between,
the rest of us struggle.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.754
Irene, have you shown this property
to anyone else recently?

16:04.922 --> 16:08.508
I don't think anyone's asked
to see it this last year.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.677
There's three vehicles.

16:10.844 --> 16:14.722
A jeep, a four-wheeler
and a luxury sedan.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.230
It's open.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.983
Hello?

16:29.488 --> 16:35.660
There's been a meeting here.
In the past few hours.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.340
What are you seeing?

16:52.761 --> 16:55.805
They forgot
there was no running water.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.774
Baby laxative.

17:36.638 --> 17:39.140
- More white powder.
- Mm.

17:45.522 --> 17:47.482
Cocaine.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.861
Irene, we have to notify the sheriff.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.960
Nicky, stop that, please.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.179
Nicky, stop it.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.058
I don't understand this at all.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.728
I just had the car checked
at Gas Farm.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.315
He told me it was
in perfect working order.

18:29.525 --> 18:32.193
Perfect working order.

18:34.113 --> 18:38.157
This is all so technical.

18:42.162 --> 18:46.207
Please, Nicky,
Uncle Dick is trying to read.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.511
Nicholas, get out of the car!

18:59.930 --> 19:02.014
Nicholas, out of the car, right now!

19:02.182 --> 19:04.725
Out of the car!

19:05.435 --> 19:07.228
Do you hear me?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.441
Are you mad at me, Uncle Dick?

19:12.609 --> 19:16.070
Well, of course I'm not mad at you.
Why should I be mad at you?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.948
- Scared you, didn't I?
- Ha-ha-ha.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.684
Uncle Dick!

19:48.103 --> 19:50.521
Don't worry, don't worry,
I'm all right, little Nicky.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.275
What if you died?
You aren't gonna die, are you?

19:54.443 --> 19:58.070
Of course not. Don't be silly.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.203
Harry?

20:05.787 --> 20:07.788
Cooper. This is Colonel Riley.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.790
He's heading up
the Air Force's investigation

20:09.958 --> 20:11.375
into Briggs' disappearance.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.794
- Colonel.
- Cooper.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.714
You were with Briggs
when we lost our coordinates on him.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.257
Yes, I was.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.136
When you were at the site,
did you notice any wildlife in the area?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.514
- Wildlife?
- Birds, owls?

20:25.682 --> 20:27.350
Yes.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.687
Yes, just moments before the major
disappeared, I heard an owl.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.023
Any visual contact?

20:34.191 --> 20:37.610
Look, colonel, Garland Briggs
is a good friend of mine.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.154
It would be a lot better
if you'd just level with us.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.449
We know about the monitors
and the messages from deep space

20:43.617 --> 20:45.576
that you received pertaining to me.

20:45.994 --> 20:50.581
You may know something,
but you best get your facts straight.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.542
Our monitors are pointed
at deep space,

20:53.710 --> 20:58.422
but the messages we intercepted
that Briggs showed you

20:58.590 --> 21:02.134
were sent from right here
in these woods.

21:02.344 --> 21:06.472
Now, where they were sent to
is another question.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.143
Might this have something to do
with a place called the White Lodge?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.938
That's classified.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.898
Colonel, we'd like to help you,

21:16.066 --> 21:18.567
but you need to give us
a little more to go on here.

21:20.237 --> 21:25.825
Garland Briggs is the best pilot
I've ever known.

21:25.993 --> 21:30.121
He was born with hardware
most of us only dream about.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.456
I can tell you this:

21:32.874 --> 21:39.547
His disappearance has implications
that go so far beyond national security

21:39.715 --> 21:43.050
the Cold War seems like a case
of the sniffles.

21:51.518 --> 21:56.063
The engine's fine,
the axle should be okay.

21:57.941 --> 22:00.484
How did you get so good at this?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.778
Oh, my uncle Ed.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.530
You think I'm good,
you should see him.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.282
He can fix anything.

22:07.909 --> 22:12.288
I was, uh, talking to your brother today
a little bit about your situation.

22:12.456 --> 22:15.291
Look, James,
mind your own business.

22:17.085 --> 22:19.045
Are you afraid?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.589
Are you afraid of your husband?

22:22.591 --> 22:24.300
Are you?

22:24.843 --> 22:27.428
There's nothing to talk about.

22:29.389 --> 22:32.224
I know what it's like to be alone.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.118
You are afraid of him, aren't you?

22:52.954 --> 22:55.331
Why don't you just leave?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.250
It's complicated.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.680
Oh, my God, it's him.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.267
I've gotta go.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.857
It's not as bad as I made it out to be.

23:49.010 --> 23:53.264
Oh, look who's here.
Did Daddy have a change of heart?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.475
Daddy just made the smartest decision
that he's made all year.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.271
Oh, yeah? That's not saying much.
What did he do?

24:00.647 --> 24:02.940
- He put me on the payroll.
- Ha-ha-ha.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.068
Bobby, you junior achiever, you.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.570
And, uh, this right here?

24:07.737 --> 24:10.656
- This is my first assignment.
- Ah.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.742
Anything I can help you with?

24:13.910 --> 24:15.369
Maybe.

24:15.537 --> 24:20.916
Maybe you can help me celebrate

24:21.084 --> 24:23.127
after I show this to the boss.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.046
Well, you know what I think,
Bobby Briggs?

24:26.506 --> 24:27.923
Tell.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.802
I think that we should think

24:31.970 --> 24:36.432
about doing business together.

24:42.022 --> 24:45.149
Audrey, I like the way you think.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.859
Thank you.

25:09.716 --> 25:11.133
Hey, Mr. Horne, how's it going?

25:16.014 --> 25:19.767
What, uh...? What is this
you're doing here, exactly?

25:20.685 --> 25:23.437
Gettysburg, day one.

25:24.564 --> 25:25.856
The South is winning.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.861
I followed Hank,
got those pictures you wanted.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.874
You see, I don't know what he's up to,
but I'm sure it's no good.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.709
I mean, I've never seen
these guys before,

25:45.877 --> 25:48.963
but they're not exactly from the Rotary,
if you know what I mean.

25:49.172 --> 25:52.883
- I like you, Bobby.
- Oh, I like you too.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.635
How much am I paying you?

25:54.803 --> 25:56.428
Uh...

25:56.846 --> 25:59.598
We haven't actually
discussed money.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.476
Well, you can consider this
your first raise.

26:02.644 --> 26:07.439
Now, you come back tomorrow,
and we will discuss a full-time position.

26:09.234 --> 26:13.904
Thank you, Ben.
I won't let you down.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.498
Oh!

26:26.167 --> 26:31.130
Nectar of the gods, my dear.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.511
It's the bubbles.

26:40.890 --> 26:45.477
Wine comes in at the mouth.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.732
Love comes in at the eye.

26:50.275 --> 26:56.780
I touch my glass to my lips,
I look at you and sigh.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.074
Thank you, Pete.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.201
That's very lyrical.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.454
It's Yeats.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.415
He's a poet.

27:06.916 --> 27:10.294
Yes, I know.

27:10.503 --> 27:13.964
The only other toast I know
is a limerick.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.133
No, really. Really, Pete, that was...

27:16.301 --> 27:21.138
- There once was a lady from Galway...
- Josie!

27:25.727 --> 27:29.688
- Yes.
- We'll have our appetizers now.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.358
- Yes.
- Oh, Josie.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.859
I just want you to know

27:34.027 --> 27:38.030
that even though your station
in this household has changed,

27:38.198 --> 27:42.826
I intend to show you all the respect
and affection that you deserve.

27:44.537 --> 27:49.792
Thank you, Catherine.
And I will try to do the same.

27:49.959 --> 27:53.003
Oh, and put on your little maid's cap.

27:57.884 --> 28:02.388
Catherine, uh, don't you think maybe
you're being a little hard on her?

28:02.555 --> 28:05.599
I mean, she is still part of the family.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.352
Josie had a hand in Andrew's death,

28:08.520 --> 28:12.314
and she did everything in her power
to destroy me.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.900
She is lucky she's not hanging
from a tree.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.362
I don't believe it.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.699
Not the Josie I know.

28:21.866 --> 28:27.579
I would like to propose a toast
to Ben Horne's double-cross.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.791
Here's to Josie Packard's
dirty deeds.

28:30.959 --> 28:35.129
And here's to the woman
who brought them down.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.841
Here's to me.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.471
Here's to you, poodle.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.353
Diane, I'm holding in my hand
a nationally distributed newspaper.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.106
My opening move, responding
to Windom Earle's opening move,

28:54.315 --> 28:57.609
was printed in the personal columns
per my instructions.

28:57.777 --> 29:03.282
But I've already received
his response to this yesterday.

29:03.450 --> 29:07.619
He anticipated my response
to his opening move perfectly.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.914
He's toying with me, Diane.

29:12.250 --> 29:16.420
I wonder where he is
and what he's planning.

29:19.507 --> 29:21.049
Meanwhile,
I've spent the past two days

29:21.217 --> 29:23.761
without badge and gun
the best way I know how:

29:23.928 --> 29:26.972
Occupying both body and spirit.

29:27.140 --> 29:28.682
Looked into some real estate,

29:28.850 --> 29:32.770
what the local agent
charitably refers to as a fixer-upper.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.189
Nonetheless, it's a place
where a man might make a home,

29:35.356 --> 29:37.608
raise a family, which is something,
in spite of my past,

29:37.776 --> 29:39.735
I still hope I'm able to do.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.906
However, as is the case here
in Twin Peaks,

29:44.073 --> 29:47.701
even this bucolic hideaway
is filled with secrets.

29:47.869 --> 29:51.497
Secrets that may be connected
to my trouble at the Bureau

29:51.664 --> 29:54.958
and the cocaine that was found
in my automobile.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.671
Agent Hardy's deliberations
will soon be completed.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.840
And if I'm not adequately able
to defend myself,

30:02.008 --> 30:05.135
there's a very real possibility
of imprisonment.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.529
- Hello, Agent Cooper.
- Audrey.

30:30.161 --> 30:32.830
This is for you. I stole it.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.250
Don't you think
you'd better give it back?

30:36.417 --> 30:38.627
Not until you look at what's inside.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.964
Okay.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.716
What am I gonna find
in here, Audrey?

30:44.926 --> 30:47.678
Pictures my father paid for.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.688
I did good, didn't I?

30:58.231 --> 31:01.275
Audrey, you did better than good.

31:01.442 --> 31:02.776
You may have saved my life.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.904
Good.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.827
So that makes us even now, right?

31:18.543 --> 31:21.086
- Denise.
- Hi, Coop.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.755
Come in.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.508
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

31:27.093 --> 31:29.386
Special Agent Denise Bryson,
Drug Enforcement Agency.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.472
This is a very good friend of mine,
Audrey Horne.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.643
They have women agents?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.937
More or less.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.400
Audrey, if you'll excuse us.
Agency business.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.277
I thought you were suspended.

31:45.862 --> 31:47.738
I am.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.908
Thanks again. Good night.

31:52.869 --> 31:57.205
Thank you. Heh.
You're welcome. Ha, ha.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.509
These are photographs
of an abandoned property

32:09.719 --> 32:11.553
on the outskirts of town.

32:11.721 --> 32:13.889
Jean Renault, Hank Jennings,

32:14.057 --> 32:17.100
Norma Jennings' stepfather,
Sergeant King, mounted police.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.561
They were at the scene
earlier today.

32:19.729 --> 32:24.524
In the kitchen I found traces of cocaine
and the baby laxative used to step it up.

32:24.984 --> 32:27.361
I think if you compare this,
which was taken from the farm,

32:27.528 --> 32:30.364
with the stuff found in my automobile,
you'll find it to be a match.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.574
- That's good news, Coop.
- Yeah.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.452
Now, can we talk about something
more important?

32:35.620 --> 32:38.497
Exactly how old is that girl?

32:39.082 --> 32:42.250
Denise, I would assume
you're no longer interested in girls.

32:42.418 --> 32:45.420
Coop, I may be wearing a dress,

32:45.588 --> 32:49.549
but I still pull my panties on one leg
at a time, if you know what I mean.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.510
Not really.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.395
You gonna eat that pie
or just push it around on my china?

33:02.063 --> 33:04.147
I guess I ain't all that hungry.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.732
Wanna talk about it?

33:05.900 --> 33:07.985
Oh, you don't wanna hear
my problems.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.697
We used to talk about everything.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.409
We can still talk, Ed.

33:16.619 --> 33:20.163
Remember when we were kids,
all those plans we made?

33:20.331 --> 33:23.792
It was like, uh, we were just waiting
around for our lives to begin,

33:24.002 --> 33:27.295
planning all that stuff we'd do
when we did.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.049
Somehow, life starts
before you know it.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.802
Suddenly, you're halfway through
living it, and all those plans,

33:33.970 --> 33:36.179
they just don't mean a damn thing.

33:37.390 --> 33:40.559
This is my life, Norma.
I just don't like it much.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.777
We can make new plans.

34:06.794 --> 34:08.545
Andrew.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.715
What is it, Dick?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.842
May I have a word with you?

34:14.010 --> 34:16.011
Sure.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.096
I feel we may have a problem.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.473
What problem?

34:19.640 --> 34:21.433
It's our mutual friend, little Nicky.

34:21.601 --> 34:24.561
- Yes?
- How shall I put this?

34:24.771 --> 34:27.731
Well, he's, he's...

34:27.899 --> 34:31.651
Andy, I believe that little Nicky,
incredible as it may seem,

34:31.861 --> 34:33.653
may in fact be the devil.

34:33.821 --> 34:35.489
Devil?

34:36.115 --> 34:39.451
Or at the very least,
homicidal in the first degree.

34:39.619 --> 34:43.830
Andy, we've got to find out
what happened to his parents.

34:48.586 --> 34:51.797
I've got the, uh, autopsy report.

34:52.006 --> 34:56.384
Dwayne, Dougie died
of natural causes. Heart attack.

34:56.552 --> 34:58.345
No evidence of foul play.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.472
Hmm. Mm-mm.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.101
Did you check him
for witchcraft? Uh-huh.

35:04.268 --> 35:09.648
That's, uh, not the kind of thing
that shows up in an autopsy.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.236
I wanna press charges.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.196
Now, Dwayne, you know
I can't press charges

35:16.364 --> 35:17.614
if there hasn't been a crime.

35:17.824 --> 35:21.076
Well, she killed him with sex.

35:21.244 --> 35:25.372
And how much clearer
does it have to be?

35:25.540 --> 35:28.041
Dwayne, it's been a long, hard day.

35:28.209 --> 35:32.003
Why don't you just go home
and try and get some rest.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.631
You want me to go to sleep.

35:34.799 --> 35:40.554
Not until that murdering hussy
is behind bars, where she belongs.

35:40.763 --> 35:44.516
I'll sue her, I'll file civil suits.

35:44.725 --> 35:48.061
She'll not get her hands
on any of Dougie's money

35:48.229 --> 35:49.813
as long as I have a breath.

35:49.981 --> 35:54.818
Not one single red cent. Nothing.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.655
I'll... I'll...

36:01.033 --> 36:04.327
Harry, do you still have
that bottle of Irish in your office?

36:04.495 --> 36:08.039
I wanna put some in a little warm milk
for the widow Milford.

36:09.250 --> 36:13.628
O, she doth teach the torches
to burn bright.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.841
It seems she hangs
against the cheek of night

36:18.009 --> 36:21.845
like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear.

36:22.013 --> 36:28.643
Beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.

36:59.967 --> 37:03.261
Twin Peaks Sheriff Station,
this is Lucy speaking.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.931
One moment, please.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.351
Sheriff Truman?

37:10.519 --> 37:12.229
Sheriff?

37:20.488 --> 37:22.113
Sheriff Truman.

37:22.281 --> 37:26.701
Sheriff Truman,
you have a telephone call, line three.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.750
One moment, please.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.966
Huh.

37:58.234 --> 38:01.569
So wait, it gets better.
And then I said:

38:01.737 --> 38:04.197
"Well, what do you think
underpants are for, anyway?"

38:05.825 --> 38:08.994
Tell us another one.
Please, another. One more.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.038
This one time, I had this cousin.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.666
He was a clown
in this rodeo, you know.

38:14.834 --> 38:19.838
They just had all these
really big horses, you know.

38:20.006 --> 38:23.091
And you will not believe
what they made him do.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.509
- What?
- What?

38:24.677 --> 38:26.344
They made him... Thank you.

38:26.512 --> 38:28.638
- They made him stand in the middle,
Yeah.

38:28.806 --> 38:32.976
and take his clown costume
completely off.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.881
Can I help you?

39:03.382 --> 39:06.718
Mr. Niles, I don't wanna put
the squeeze on you.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.595
You've been to prison,

39:08.763 --> 39:11.639
I don't need to paint you
any pictures.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.268
What's this all about?

39:15.436 --> 39:20.065
For starters, you're guilty
of a serious parole violation.

39:20.399 --> 39:21.608
Ugh.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.735
Enough to put you back inside.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.863
And unless you cooperate,

39:27.031 --> 39:33.453
I intend to do everything in my power
to make sure you stay there.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.248
My name is Ernie Niles,
and I confess.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.666
I'm guilty.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.961
I guess I'm terribly guilty,
against my will, of course.

39:42.129 --> 39:44.464
Mr. Niles,
we're not really interested in all the...

39:44.632 --> 39:46.174
They held me at gunpoint,
they beat me,

39:46.342 --> 39:48.009
they threatened me
with physical violence.

39:48.177 --> 39:50.053
These men are animals,
they'll stop at nothing.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.262
Mr. Niles, just...

39:51.430 --> 39:52.931
They wanted me
to sell drugs for them.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.893
I tried to resist,
but my family means everything to me.

39:57.061 --> 40:01.648
My family... When they threatened
my wife, well, I weakened, you know.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.608
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.070
I guess I did wrong but, you know,

40:07.238 --> 40:10.907
love makes a guy do foolish things,
you know, illegal things...

40:11.075 --> 40:13.076
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie, will you shut up?

40:13.244 --> 40:15.495
Mr. Niles, we appreciate the trials
you've been through,

40:15.663 --> 40:16.913
we sympathize with you.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.706
- You do?
- That's why we're here.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.875
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

40:21.043 --> 40:22.919
Now tell us everything you know.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.588
Yes, this is, uh...
Well, they tortured me,

40:25.756 --> 40:28.091
and the thing was,
they did filthy, horrible...

40:28.259 --> 40:29.592
Mr. Niles, please.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.971
Just the information pertaining
to the selling of drugs, if you please.

40:33.139 --> 40:34.431
All right, yeah.

40:34.598 --> 40:40.937
Yeah. Well, they got four kilos
of cocaine to sell so...

40:41.105 --> 40:42.355
And they're looking for buyers.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.401
So to protect my family,
I told them I could find one.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.819
Have you?

40:47.987 --> 40:51.114
Are you kidding? I don't know anybody
who would do anything like that.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.158
You do now.

40:53.868 --> 40:57.328
A major drug trafficker
will arrive from Seattle tomorrow.

40:57.496 --> 41:01.166
You will set up a meet with these men
at the Dead Dog Farm.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.792
I will?

41:04.044 --> 41:07.464
How will I, uh...?
How will I know him?

41:08.716 --> 41:10.800
You're looking at him.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.470
Him? Him...

41:13.637 --> 41:18.725
Will you excuse me?
I've got a nervous bladder.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.940
Why?! Why?! Why would you?

41:31.697 --> 41:33.448
You could have...

41:46.837 --> 41:48.546
Is she gonna be okay?

41:50.633 --> 41:53.051
First time he beat her,
I swore revenge.

41:53.219 --> 41:56.054
Something violent and noble.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.598
She begged me not to hurt him,
made me promise,

41:58.766 --> 42:01.142
said it was for both our sakes.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.979
That was four years ago.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.359
One day, I swear, I'll kill him.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.779
No matter what it costs.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.223
Jeez, Mom,
give me a heart attack.

42:40.391 --> 42:41.933
I'm sorry.

42:42.142 --> 42:45.562
What are you doing here
sitting alone in the dark?

42:47.147 --> 42:51.150
Nothing. Just sitting here.

42:51.318 --> 42:55.196
Well, read a book or something,
will you? It's creepy.

43:02.830 --> 43:05.123
It's Dad, right?

43:05.291 --> 43:07.333
He'll be back, you know he will.

43:07.543 --> 43:10.086
This is just some of that
top-secret jazz.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.339
I'm not so sure this time.

43:19.888 --> 43:21.889
I was at the Double R
a couple of weeks ago.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.811
Dad and I, we had this talk

43:26.979 --> 43:30.315
about this dream he had.

43:30.482 --> 43:36.362
It was a big house in white marble,
lots of lights.

43:37.448 --> 43:41.075
Dad was there, and I was there too,

43:41.410 --> 43:45.496
living a life of deep harmony and joy.

43:46.165 --> 43:49.917
And there was all this stuff
about my future.

43:50.544 --> 43:52.587
Good stuff.

43:54.673 --> 43:58.509
Kind of nice. Mom, it was cool.

43:59.094 --> 44:02.472
Your father
is an extraordinary human being.

44:04.391 --> 44:07.560
My father
is a deeply weird individual.

44:08.687 --> 44:11.814
But he has a lot more going on
under his hat than most people,

44:11.982 --> 44:13.858
that's for sure.

44:14.026 --> 44:16.444
Sometimes when I'm sleeping

44:17.863 --> 44:21.115
he runs his fingers through my hair.

44:22.284 --> 44:25.536
He thinks I don't notice, but I do.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.174
How long have I been gone?

44:38.717 --> 44:42.637
- Two days.
- Strange.

44:43.764 --> 44:45.598
It seemed much shorter.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.143
Garland!

44:54.733 --> 44:57.735
Bobby, I want you
to put out that cigarette.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.494
Then I'd like you to fix me a cocktail.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.080
A strong one, if you don't mind.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.998
Sure, Dad.

45:18.090 --> 45:20.508
Is everything all right?

45:21.260 --> 45:23.136
No, dear.

45:23.679 --> 46:28.409
Not exactly.
