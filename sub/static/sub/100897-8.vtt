WATCH THE DOOR.

01:16.337 --> 01:19.470
WE DO THIS FOR HIM.

01:19.514 --> 01:22.299
ECHO AND OCTAVIA
ARE IN TROUBLE.

01:22.343 --> 01:25.433
WE DO THIS
FOR OUR FAMILY.

01:25.476 --> 01:26.869
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.010
I'M COMING IN ALONE...

01:38.054 --> 01:39.490
UNARMED.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.970
RAVEN: WHO ARE YOU?

01:42.537 --> 01:46.628
THEY CALL ME HE SHEPHERD,
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME BILL.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.412
YOU HAVE ME.

01:48.456 --> 01:51.502
NOW LET MY PEOPLE GO.

01:51.546 --> 01:52.982
IT'S OK.

02:04.472 --> 02:06.691
I'VE SEEN YOU BEFORE.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.780
THEN YOU MUST BE
CLARKE.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.219
I KNOW WHY
THE SECOND DAWN LOGO

02:12.262 --> 02:14.482
WAS ON THAT
BURIAL SHROUD.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.788
BURIAL SHROUD.
THEN YOU WERE ON NAKARA.

02:16.832 --> 02:19.182
THAT EXPLAINS THE SMELL.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.792
HOW THE HELL
ARE YOU HERE?

02:20.836 --> 02:22.403
THAT'S A VERY LONG STORY.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.677
WE WEREN'T A CULT.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.288
WE WERE A COLLECTIVE
OF GREAT MINDS DEDICATED

02:38.332 --> 02:40.290
TO THE CONTINUATION
OF OUR SPECIES.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.947
SLOWER, PLEASE. UM...

02:44.990 --> 02:46.427
IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.429
IT SOUNDS DIFFERENT.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.606
MY GOD.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.437
IF HER LANGUAGE
SURVIVED,

02:56.480 --> 02:58.265
THEN THAT MUST MEAN...

03:01.355 --> 03:04.836
IS MY DAUGHTER
IN THE KEY?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.490
JORDAN: IS YOUR DAUGHTER
IN WHERE?

03:06.534 --> 03:08.579
THE AI IN CLARKE'S HEAD.

03:08.623 --> 03:12.801
WHAT YOU CALL THE FLAME,
THEY CALL THE KEY.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.020
CADOGAN: BECCA SAID
THAT IT WOULD MERGE
WITH A HUMAN MIND.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.587
-BECCA?
-YES.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.589
HE BURNED HER
AT THE STAKE.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.984
DID CALLIE TELL

03:25.292 --> 03:27.772
YOU RECOGNIZED MY FACE,

03:27.816 --> 03:32.342

03:32.386 --> 03:35.084
YOU SPEAK A LANGUAGE

03:49.011 --> 03:51.143
EXTREME? WHAT A JOKE.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.623
WE WERE THERE PEACEFULLY.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.146
THEY'RE THE EXTREME ONES.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.539
WILL YOU PLEASE
CONCENTRATE?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.193
RATHER NOT BE SCARRED

AN UNSOLVABLE PROBLEM
A BAD CHOICE

07:13.520 --> 07:15.304

TO BAD CHOICES.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.697
COMING FROM
THE VULTURE CAPITALIST

07:16.740 --> 07:18.394

I'LL TAKE THAT

07:21.615 --> 07:24.008
IT WASN'T. I RAISED YOU

07:24.052 --> 07:26.271
NOT JOIN THE LATEST
CULTURAL MOOD SWING.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.969

BUT WHAT ABOUT LUCY?

08:37.168 --> 08:38.605
LUCY'S NOT

08:38.648 --> 08:40.345
MOM, NEITHER ARE WE.
WE LEFT.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.043
WHAT THE HELL

08:42.086 --> 08:45.655
ANACONDA IS CODE

08:45.699 --> 08:47.701
NOW PUT ON THE DAMN PACK.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.790
HE'S LYING. THIS IS
JUST ANOTHER WAY TO
GET US BACK.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.400
HOW WOULD HE KNOW
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE?

08:51.443 --> 08:53.533
HE DOESN'T. AS WE SPEAK,
THERE ARE PEOPLE

08:53.576 --> 08:55.056
WITH CONNECTIONS
ALL OVER THE WORLD

08:55.099 --> 08:56.536
SCRAMBLING FOR BUNKERS.

08:56.579 --> 08:57.885

THE TRUTH.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.147
CAL, YOUR FATHER IS
A LOT OF THINGS,

08:59.190 --> 09:00.931
BUT HE IS NOT A LAIR.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.020
LUCY: HEY.

09:03.064 --> 09:04.892
EVERYTHING OK?

09:04.935 --> 09:07.068

BECAUSE--

09:10.071 --> 09:12.029
CALLIE: MOM! MOM!
WHAT THE HELL?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.465
I KNOW, I KNOW, BABY,
BUT IT WILL BE

09:13.509 --> 09:15.032
SO MUCH EASIER
FOR HER THIS WAY.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.338
SO, WHAT, THAT'S IT?
I JUST DROP

09:16.381 --> 09:17.600

09:23.301 --> 09:25.608
DO YOU WANT TO LIVE

09:52.287 --> 09:53.636
MOM.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.448
CADOGAN, ON P.A.: STAY CALM.

WE HAVE PREPARED YOU ALL

10:25.799 --> 10:27.844
I KNOW YOU ARE FRIGHTENED.

10:27.888 --> 10:31.239
I KNOW YOUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY
WITH THE LOSS OF SO MUCH,

10:31.282 --> 10:33.328
BUT WE WILL SURVIVE THIS.

10:45.601 --> 10:46.907
THERE'S ROOM FOR EVERYONE.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.430
IF YOU BROUGHT A BAG,

10:48.473 --> 10:49.823
YOU'LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT

10:49.866 --> 10:51.041
BUT DON'T WORRY.

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.674
I THINK I'M GONNA
BE SICK.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.414
WOMAN: WAIT. SHE JUST SAID

11:16.458 --> 11:17.938

12:03.200 --> 12:04.767
CADOGAN, ON P.A.: I KNOW YOUR
HEARTS ARE HEAVY

12:04.811 --> 12:06.856
WITH THE LOSS OF SO MUCH,

12:06.900 --> 12:08.771
BUT WE WILL SURVIVE THIS.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.339
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN FEW
WHO HAVE HEARD THE MESSAGE

12:11.382 --> 12:13.776
AND ARE TO BECOME THE FOUNDING
MOTHERS AND FATHERS

12:13.820 --> 12:15.647
OF THE SECOND DAWN
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.217
THE WORLD HAS BEEN ON THE BRINK
OF THIS MOMENT FOR DECADES.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.393
WE TRIED TO GET THEM TO LISTEN.

12:25.919 --> 12:28.443
JUST IN TIME.
ONLY TWO SYMBOLS TO GO.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.097
REESE: YOU IDENTIFIED
THE CODE?

12:30.140 --> 12:32.142
CALLIE: HEAR THAT, MOM?
ONLY TWO SYMBOLS TO GO.

12:32.186 --> 12:35.798
WHO CARES THAT 11 BILLION
PEOPLE ARE ON FIRE
AS WE SPEAK?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.669
MOM: HE CARES. HE'S JUST
A NARCISSIST

12:37.713 --> 12:39.671
WITH SOCIOPATHIC TENDENCIES.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.064
CADOGAN: THAT'S
THE NICEST THING
YOU'VE SAID TO ME

12:41.108 --> 12:43.763
IN TWO YEARS.

12:43.806 --> 12:47.375
YOU WERE ALWAYS MEAN
WHEN YOU GOT SCARED,
YOU KNOW THAT,

12:47.418 --> 12:50.030
BUT FEAR NOT.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.814
WE'RE ABOUT TO KNOCK
THE APOCALYPSE

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
OFF THE FRONT PAGE.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.513
MACHU PICCHU?

12:55.557 --> 12:59.735
A HIDDEN OBSERVATORY
BENEATH THE TEMPLE OF THE SUN

12:59.779 --> 13:02.782
200 FEET FROM WHERE
I FOUND THE DEVICE.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.522
STOLE IT,
YOU MEAN.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.786
YOU CAN'T STEAL SOMETHING
THAT BELONGS TO ALL OF US.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.833
IT WAS SENT HERE
TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.012
THERE ARE 7 SYMBOLS
ON THAT WALL,

13:16.056 --> 13:20.843
AND WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES
7 POINTS

13:20.887 --> 13:24.934
TO CHART A COURSE
THROUGH SPACE.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.806
ENTER THE LAST
TWO SYMBOLS.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.083
WHO WANTS TO GO
FOR A RIDE?

13:57.706 --> 14:00.709
CALLIE: SPACE BALL,
2 MILLION AND 2.

14:00.752 --> 14:04.626
CULTURAL ARTIFACT THIEF,

14:07.237 --> 14:11.676
MOM: NOW THAT THAT'S DONE,
BILL, YOU NEED TO GET OUT THERE.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.853
THESE PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN YOU,
BUT THEY'RE AFRAID.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.767
REESE: WE SAVED THEM.
THEY'LL BE FINE.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.421
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
THEY'VE LOST EVERYTHING.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.728
-NOT THEIR LIVES.
-ENOUGH.

14:19.771 --> 14:21.730
THIS FAMILY CANNOT
BE SEEN FIGHTING.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.950
WE NEED TO SET
AN EXAMPLE,
ESPECIALLY NOW.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.865
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS
WILL BE THE HARDEST.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.433
WHEN SHE'S RIGHT,
SHE'S RIGHT.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.218
REESE, THANK YOU
FOR HANDLING
THE INTAKE.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.915
CADOGAN: WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS?
REESE: WE DID WELL.

14:35.309 --> 14:38.616
92% OF ALL LEVEL 12s

14:38.660 --> 14:41.402
THAT'S 1,104.
I'VE ALREADY FACTORED IN

14:41.445 --> 14:43.230

RESOURCE ALLOCATION.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.232

15:09.038 --> 15:11.171

15:15.871 --> 15:17.786
AND DON'T TRY TO TELL ME
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE CODE.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.528
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.182
I'VE GOT
A BETTER IDEA.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.923
FIRST, WE PUT ON
RADIATION SUITS.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.533
THEN WE GET TRISTAN

15:32.018 --> 15:34.759
I SAY WE FILL IT UP.
SOUND GOOD?

15:47.598 --> 15:49.774
HATE TO SEE
THE OTHER GUY.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.820
THE OTHER GUY WAS
A RIOT COP WITH A BATON.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.909
YEAH. MINE SHOT

16:02.874 --> 16:04.702
TRISTAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.749
YOUR FATHER SAYS WE'RE

16:09.925 --> 16:11.274
-YOU KNOW THAT.

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT...

17:56.336 --> 18:00.209

18:59.007 --> 19:00.748

LIKE TO TALK

23:28.450 --> 23:29.582

23:37.677 --> 23:39.330
THERE ARE
A MILLION WAYS TO DIE

23:39.374 --> 23:40.897
THE MOMENT YOU REACH
THE OTHER SIDE.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.551
IF YOU REACH
THE OTHER SIDE.

23:42.595 --> 23:43.944
OUR BODIES MAY NOT BE
DESIGNED FOR THE JOURNEY.

23:43.987 --> 23:46.033
CADOGAN: THEN LET'S
DO THE SCIENCE.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.470
OK. LET'S DO
THE SCIENCE,

23:48.514 --> 23:50.951
BUT THAT COULD

FRIENDS OF MINE,
NONE OF WHO HAD

24:14.583 --> 24:17.325
IN WHETHER THEY WANTED

THEIR LIVES UNDERGROUND.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.587
-ARE YOU THROUGH?
-I DON'T KNOW.

24:18.631 --> 24:21.285
-DID I CONVINCE YOU?
-YES.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.939
THAT A BRIDGE
TO ANOTHER WORLD IS

24:22.983 --> 24:24.375
THE ANSWER TO OUR PRAYERS.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.594
REESE: I AGREE WITH DAD.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.074
SHOCKING
COMING FROM YOU.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.380
GRACE: YOUR FATHER'S
RIGHT, CAL.

24:29.424 --> 24:32.383
LOOK AT IT. HE SAW
THE END OF THE WORLD

24:32.427 --> 24:34.037
AND THAT THIS WAS
OUR WAY OUT,

24:34.081 --> 24:35.735
AND NOW IT'S HERE.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.955
GOD KNOWS I HAD MY DOUBTS
ALONG THE WAY,

24:38.999 --> 24:41.349
BUT IF YOUR FATHER SAYS
THAT THAT PORTAL

24:41.392 --> 24:45.222
IS THE WAY HOME,
THEN I BELIEVE HIM.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.009
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE SURE
OF ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

25:06.417 --> 25:08.071
IT WORKED.

25:10.683 --> 25:13.424
WOMAN: GIFTS
FOR THE KIDS?

25:13.468 --> 25:15.339
HOW IS HE?

25:15.383 --> 25:18.691
NOT BAD CONSIDERING
HE SHOULD BE DEAD.

25:18.734 --> 25:21.607
LUNGS ARE CLEAR,
NO FEVER.

25:21.650 --> 25:24.435
ARE YOU SURE
HE WAS EXPOSED?

25:24.479 --> 25:26.176
PRETTY SURE.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.293
YOU CLOSED THE PORTAL.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.644
YEAH. I DIDN'T WANT
YOUR FATHER TO THROW
ME IN IT.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.823
HOW DO WE GET HIM
TO CHANGE HIS MIND?

26:03.866 --> 26:06.086
WE DON'T. HE WAS
ALWAYS STUBBORN,

26:06.129 --> 26:09.045
BUT NOW AFTER
BEING WORSHIPPED
FOR TWO YEARS,

26:09.089 --> 26:11.570
HE BELIEVES HE CAN
WALK ON WATER.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.484
AND YOU DON'T?

26:13.528 --> 26:15.008
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

26:16.923 --> 26:20.317
-YOU JUST MET ME.
-IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.842
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR WORK
SINCE I WAS A CHILD.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.540
IRONICALLY, IT WAS MY DAD
WHO WAS THE ONE THAT
FIRST TOLD ME ABOUT YOU.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.586
I THINK HE THOUGHT I'D BE
INSPIRED BY A GIRL

26:27.629 --> 26:29.979
WHO WENT TO HARVARD
WHEN SHE WAS 10.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.720
INSTEAD, IT MADE ME FEEL
INADEQUATE.

26:31.764 --> 26:34.549
SOMETHING TELLS ME
THAT YOU ARE NOT THAT.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.598
YOU SAVED
TRISTAN'S LIFE.

26:39.641 --> 26:42.078
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT
FOR EVERYONE.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.733
-AND YOUR FATHER?
-MY FATHER WON'T KNOW

26:44.777 --> 26:47.910
BECAUSE HE'LL BE
TOO BUSY WITH YOU
IN HERE.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.046
COME ON.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.395
YOU KNOW YOU
WANT TO.

26:54.438 --> 26:57.964
DO I? ENLIGHTEN ME.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.097
OK. THE SCAR
ON YOUR NECK.

27:01.141 --> 27:03.230
MY GUESS, IT'S
FROM A NEURAL IMPLANT.

27:03.273 --> 27:06.059
KNOWING YOUR WORK
WITH MACHINE
INTELLIGENCE,

27:06.102 --> 27:08.148
I'D SAY THERE'S
AN AI ON IT.

27:08.191 --> 27:09.758
SOMEHOW, IT HEIGHTENED
YOUR SENSES,

27:09.802 --> 27:11.586
ALLOWING YOU TO HEAR
THE SPACE BALL,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.414
DOING IN 10 SECONDS
SOMETHING MY DAD

27:13.457 --> 27:15.416
COULDN'T DO
IN 12 YEARS.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.331
HOW AM I DOING
SO FAR?

27:17.374 --> 27:19.942
MORE THAN ADEQUATE.

27:19.986 --> 27:23.772
THE, UH, AI IS MY PENANCE.

27:23.816 --> 27:26.601
PENANCE? FOR WHAT?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.516
IN TIME.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.300
THE PROGRAM'S NAME
IS ALIE-2,

27:30.344 --> 27:32.389
BUT I LIKE TO CALL IT
THE FLAME.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.435
-IT'S, UH, AN HOMAGE TO--
-PROMETHEUS,

27:34.478 --> 27:37.481
STEALING FIRE
FROM THE GODS? COOL.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.658
WE BOTH KNOW THERE'S
NO WAY YOU'RE SATISFIED

27:39.701 --> 27:41.485
JUST TURNING IT ON.

27:41.529 --> 27:43.313
I BET YOU WERE WORKING
ON IT WHEN YOU CAME IN.

27:43.357 --> 27:46.882
YES. THE SILENCE
WAS REALLY NICE.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.841
-HMM.
-HEH.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.412
IT'S NOT JUST SILENCE.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.156
I WAS LISTENING
TO THE SYMBOLS,

28:00.200 --> 28:02.332
CATALOGING THEM BASED
ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE SOUND,

28:02.376 --> 28:06.728
BUT 7 OF THEM HAVE
NO SOUND.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.948
I THOUGHT MAYBE
THEY HAD BEEN DAMAGED,

28:08.991 --> 28:10.732
BUT NOW I THINK...

28:33.363 --> 28:34.974
CALLIE: WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28:35.017 --> 28:36.671
BECCA: I DON'T KNOW.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.549
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:49.466 --> 28:51.033
IT'S COOL.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.776
SO MUCH FOR DOING
THE SCIENCE.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.142
CADOGAN: MY GOD.

29:15.101 --> 29:16.667
WHAT DID YOU DO?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.283
YOU'RE SHIVERING.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.984
WHERE DID YOU GO?

29:29.028 --> 29:31.073
WE'RE NOT READY.

29:31.117 --> 29:32.683
I HAVE TO SHUT IT DOWN.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.033
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

29:34.076 --> 29:35.774
IF YOU SAW WHAT I SAW,

29:35.817 --> 29:37.819
YOU WOULD LET ME
SHUT IT DOWN.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.952
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW,
AND I MIGHT.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.345
JUDGMENT DAY.

29:42.389 --> 29:45.348
JUDGMENT DAY CAME AND WENT,
AND WE'RE STILL HERE.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.830
BECAUSE THAT
WASN'T JUDGMENT DAY.

29:48.874 --> 29:52.225
PLEASE YOU HAVE TO
TRUST ME AND KNOW

29:52.268 --> 29:55.489
THAT NONE OF US IS READY
FOR THIS.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.230
I AM.

29:57.273 --> 30:00.059
ESPECIALLY NOT YOU.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.930
CADOGAN: DON'T LET HER
TOUCH THE DEVICE.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.540
BECCA: PLEASE.

30:06.543 --> 30:08.458
PUT HER IN THE BOX
UNTIL SHE CHANGES HER MIND.

30:08.502 --> 30:12.419
BECCA: NO.
NO, BILL...

30:12.462 --> 30:13.899
CALLIE: DAD, NO! SHE--
BECCA: YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.510
-NO. SHE--
-YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME!

30:20.166 --> 30:22.037
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

30:22.081 --> 30:25.214
NOTHING. SHE WAS GONE
WHEN I GOT HERE.

30:25.258 --> 30:29.958
DAD, I THINK SHE CAME
TO YOU FOR A REASON.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.743
IT WASN'T TO OPEN
A BRIDGE TO
ANOTHER WORLD.

30:32.787 --> 30:36.008
IT WAS TO HELP US
REMAKE THIS ONE.

30:36.051 --> 30:39.446
I WILL SAVE US, NOT HER.
NOW GET OUT!

30:58.378 --> 30:59.945
TRISTAN: 5 DAYS.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.338
YOU WANT A DRINK
OF WATER?

31:02.382 --> 31:05.646
YOU GOT SOME POWERFUL
PEOPLE UPSET WITH YOU.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.996
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR WHAT YOU DID--

31:08.040 --> 31:09.737
UNH! UGH!

31:13.480 --> 31:14.960
I TRIED TO GET
IN SOONER,

31:15.003 --> 31:18.050
BUT THEY'RE WATCHING
EVERYTHING.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.922
KEYS, KEYS.
WHERE ARE THEY?

31:20.966 --> 31:23.098
DAMN IT. REESE MUST
HAVE THE KEYS.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.408
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT IS IT?

31:28.451 --> 31:29.888
MY BROTHER FOUND
YOUR NOTEBOOK.

31:29.931 --> 31:31.715
HE KNOWS ABOUT
THE FLAME.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.805
THEN THEY'RE GONNA
KILL ME.

31:34.849 --> 31:37.373
NO. WAIT. I'M GONNA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

31:37.417 --> 31:40.463
WITHOUT NIGHTBLOOD,
THEY CAN'T COME
AFTER US.

31:40.507 --> 31:41.943
NIGHTBLOOD?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.510
IT'S A GOOD NAME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

31:43.553 --> 31:45.033
MY FRIEND AUGUST,
HE CAME UP WITH IT.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.513
HALF THE KIDS IN
THE BUNKER ARE
WITH US NOW,

31:46.556 --> 31:48.384
SOME OF THEIR
PARENTS, TOO.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.430
I NEED MORE TIME
TO GET THAT KEY.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.301
THERE IS NO MORE TIME.

31:52.345 --> 31:54.347
CALLIE, LISTEN TO ME.
YOUR FATHER CAN'T

31:54.390 --> 31:56.131
HAVE THE FLAME.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.264
HE'LL USE IT TO FIND
THE FINAL CODE,

31:58.307 --> 32:00.527
AND ONCE HE HAS IT,
WHATEVER'S LEFT

32:00.570 --> 32:02.964
OF THE HUMAN RACE
WILL BE WIPED OUT.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.966
I CAN'T TELL YOU ANY MORE.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.489
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
TRUST ME.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.578
-I DO.
-GOOD.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.580
THEN HELP ME TAKE IT OUT.

32:10.624 --> 32:13.453
WHAT? NO. NO.

32:13.496 --> 32:16.151
THE NOTEBOOK SAID
YOU HAVE TO DIE FIRST.

32:16.195 --> 32:18.023
THE AI WILL PROTECT
ITSELF.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.894
IF YOU DROWN,
IT'LL SWIM.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.504
IF YOU BURN, IT'LL CRAWL
OUT OF THE FLAMES.

32:21.548 --> 32:23.115
YOU WROTE THAT.

32:23.158 --> 32:26.683
YES, BUT WHAT DIDN'T
I WRITE?

32:26.727 --> 32:29.034
THERE'S A BACKDOOR.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.340
-DO YOU SPEAK LATIN?
-YES.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.907
I LEARNED IT
WHEN I WAS 10

32:32.951 --> 32:35.127
TO HELP ME CREATE
MY OWN LANGUAGE.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.956
GOOD. THEN ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS SPEAK
THE PHRASE

32:37.999 --> 32:39.870
"GOOD-BYE FOR NOW"
IN LATIN.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.437
GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.
THAT'S, UH, QUIA--

32:41.481 --> 32:44.919
NO, NO. NOT YET.
THERE'S MORE YOU NEED TO KNOW.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.356
OK. WITHOUT
THE BLOOD ALTERATIONS,

32:47.400 --> 32:48.836
THE FLAME WILL LIQUEFY
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

32:48.879 --> 32:50.577
OF THE HOST RATHER
THAN MERGE WITH IT.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.970
THAT WOULD BE BAD.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.232
NOT AS BAD AS WHAT HAPPENS
IF IT MERGES

32:53.275 --> 32:54.624
WITH THE WRONG
NERVOUS SYSTEM.

32:54.668 --> 32:57.758
THAT'S WHY YOU MUST
CHOOSE WISELY.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.760
-I MUST?
-YES.

32:59.803 --> 33:03.851
I DESIGNED IT TO AMPLIFY
WHAT IS ALREADY THERE,

33:03.894 --> 33:06.810
AND IN THE RIGHT MIND,
I BELIEVE WITH ALL MY HEART

33:06.854 --> 33:09.683
THAT IT CAN SAVE THE WORLD,

33:09.726 --> 33:11.946
BUT WITH ALL THAT POWER
IN THE WRONG MIND--

33:11.990 --> 33:13.687
REESE: WHERE THE HELL
IS TRISTAN?

33:13.730 --> 33:15.863
YOU CAN'T TELL THEM
THE PASSPHRASE.

33:15.906 --> 33:18.126
IF I DON'T,
THEY'LL KILL YOU.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.998
I WILL BE IN THE FLAME.

33:20.041 --> 33:23.131
GET IT BACK. KEEP IT SAFE.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.611
PROMISE ME.

33:26.526 --> 33:27.875
STAND UP.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.095
REESE, PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.

33:30.138 --> 33:31.618
GUARD: HOLD OUT
YOUR HANDS.

33:31.661 --> 33:34.186
BECCA: CALLIE, THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

33:34.229 --> 33:36.275
ONE LAST CHANCE.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.407
TELL US THE CODE.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.322
NEVER.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.587
GUARD: MOVE. LET'S GO.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.287
GOOD-BYE FOR NOW.

33:48.330 --> 33:49.984
GUARD: MOVE IT.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.857
YOU CAN'T STOP THIS.

33:53.901 --> 33:56.077
IF YOU TRY, THIS CAGE
WILL BE YOURS.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.079
KEEP HER HERE
TILL WE'RE OUTSIDE.

33:58.123 --> 34:02.083
CALLIE: REESE!
PLEASE! NO, REESE!

34:02.127 --> 34:03.650
REESE!

34:05.608 --> 34:07.915
BECCA: NO! WAIT. STOP!

34:07.958 --> 34:10.526
YOU THINK THAT HE'S
SAVING YOU.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.006
HE'S KILLING YOU!

34:12.050 --> 34:13.747
NO! AAH!

34:25.454 --> 34:27.630
MAN: HEADS UP, DISCIPLES.
INCOMING.

34:27.674 --> 34:28.762
AUGUST: LET'S GO,
TREE CREW!

34:28.805 --> 34:30.590
REESE, STAND DOWN.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.418
CALLIE, NO, NOT LIKE THIS.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.376
YOU LET THIS HAPPEN!

34:34.420 --> 34:35.725
MAN: BACK IN
THROUGH HERE.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.336
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.467
GIVE IT TO ME!

34:38.511 --> 34:40.991
NO. THE AI's OURS NOW.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.777
-REESE, NO.
-MOM, STAY OUT OF THIS.

34:43.820 --> 34:46.432
CALLIE, YOU HAVE 3 SECONDS
TO LEAD THEM BACK
TO THEIR ROOMS.

34:46.475 --> 34:47.911
AUGUST: OR WHAT?
YOU GONNA SHOOT US?

34:47.955 --> 34:49.391
AUGUST, I CAN
HANDLE THIS.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.610
GRACE: REESE, PUT THAT
GUN AWAY NOW.

34:50.653 --> 34:51.915
THAT'S AN ORDER.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.352
DISCIPLES, ESCORT
THEM DOWN.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.397
ANYONE RESISTS,
FORCE IS AUTHORIZED.

34:55.441 --> 34:57.704
GOOD TO KNOW. HUH!

34:57.747 --> 35:00.576
GRACE: ENOUGH!
I SAID NO! STAND DOWN!

35:03.231 --> 35:05.799
HOW ABOUT WE SETTLE THIS
LIKE WERE IN THE BASEMENT?

35:07.540 --> 35:08.932
HOLD.

35:14.068 --> 35:16.244
NO ONE LEAVES.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.724
YOU TAP, I GET THE FLAME.

35:17.767 --> 35:20.118
I TAP, YOU DO.
SOUND LIKE A PLAN?

35:20.161 --> 35:23.730
YOU KNOW, IN THE BASEMENT,
I ALWAYS TOOK IT
EASY ON YOU.

35:23.773 --> 35:27.255
-NOT TODAY.
-IN THAT CASE...

35:27.299 --> 35:28.604
AAH!

35:28.648 --> 35:30.171
GRACE: CALLIE!

35:30.215 --> 35:31.520
REESE: YOU SHOT ME.
I'M YOUR BROTHER.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.783
THAT WAS FOR BECCA.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.133
GRACE: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

35:35.176 --> 35:36.656
REESE, YOU'RE GONNA BE
OK, BABY.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.310
IT'S JUST YOUR SHOULDER.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.269
LET THEM PASS,
OR YOU'RE NEXT.

35:42.879 --> 35:44.359
MAN: DO WHAT SHE SAYS.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.621
-IT'S THEIR FUNERAL.
-LET THEM GO.

35:45.665 --> 35:48.015
MOVE OUT! GO, GO!

35:48.058 --> 35:49.495
GRACE: I NEED SOMETHING
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

35:53.455 --> 35:54.978
CALLIE:
I'VE GOT YOU, BECCA.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.940
THE SERUM NOW.

35:59.983 --> 36:01.637
HE'LL BE A NIGHTBLOOD
IN AN HOUR.

36:01.681 --> 36:05.032
IF HE COMES TO HIS SENSES,
WE'LL BE HEADED WEST.

36:05.075 --> 36:06.773
ONE MORE.

36:06.816 --> 36:09.776
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVE.

36:09.819 --> 36:11.560
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
OF YOU TO SURVIVE
ON THE GROUND.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.737
THERE WILL BE.
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH DOSES
FOR 2,000 MORE.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.739
IF THEY'RE OUT THERE,
WE'LL FIND THEM.

36:18.567 --> 36:19.829
WE GOT COMPANY.
IT'S YOUR DAD

36:19.873 --> 36:21.657
AND THE REST
OF THE DISCIPLES.

36:21.701 --> 36:23.355
IT WON'T TAKE THEM LONG
TO OVERRIDE MY KEYPAD HACK.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.095
CALLIE: HE'LL NEVER
LET US LEAVE.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.141
CALLIE: NOW, MOM, PLEASE.
GRACE: YOU NEED TO HURRY.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.057
GO. I'LL HANDLE
YOUR FATHER.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.276
AUGUST: CALLIE.
CALLIE: GO ON.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.234
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.062
AUGUST: MOVE OUT.

36:35.105 --> 36:38.152
IT'S OK.
I'VE BEEN TO EARTH.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.373
I'D RATHER SEE WHAT'S
BEHIND DOOR NUMBER TWO.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.940
I LOVE YOU.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.855
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.776
GO.

36:53.820 --> 36:56.692
AUGUST: EVERYBODY INSIDE.
I DON'T CARE IF THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH ROOM.

36:56.736 --> 36:58.433
GO. COME ON!

37:01.480 --> 37:04.004
STOP THEM!

37:04.047 --> 37:05.745
STOP THEM!

37:05.788 --> 37:07.399
GRACE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:07.442 --> 37:08.791
AUGUST: CALLIE, RUN

37:08.835 --> 37:10.053
CADOGAN: THE HATCH ONLY OPENS

37:10.097 --> 37:11.664
WHEN THE INNER DOOR
IS SEALED.

37:11.707 --> 37:13.622
DON'T LET THEM CLOSE IT!

37:16.190 --> 37:17.931
MAN: DON'T LET THEM CLOSE IT.
AUGUST: PUSH!

37:22.892 --> 37:25.068
AUGUST: OPEN THE HATCH.

37:35.644 --> 37:40.388
MAN: TAKE IT EASY.
NICE AND SLOW.

37:40.432 --> 37:42.999
I'M FINE.
IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH.

37:43.043 --> 37:45.393
DID YOU GET THE AI?
LET ME SEE IT.

37:47.961 --> 37:50.964
CALLIE TOOK IT,
BUT I CAN GET IT BACK.

37:51.007 --> 37:54.272
SHE GAVE ME
THE BLOOD TREATMENT.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.274
I WILL GET IT BACK.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.840
SIR, I'LL GO
WITH HIM.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.827
WE HAVE TO LET
HER GO, BILL.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.457
BILL, NO! WHAT, ARE--
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

38:49.501 --> 38:50.937
I DON'T HAVE
THE BLOOD TREATMENT!

38:53.983 --> 38:56.072
BILL! BILL!

39:00.816 --> 39:04.864
GET ME THAT AI.
I DON'T CARE WHAT
YOU HAVE TO DO.
