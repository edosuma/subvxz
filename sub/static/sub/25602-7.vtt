Thrusters are now
at full power.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.347
Give it everything
you've got.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.146
(ENGINE STRAINING)

11:40.240 --> 11:41.502
No change.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.660
We are still onIcourse for the
event hor/zon /n four m/nutes.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.261
We need more power.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.340
Okay, reroute all coil and
rail guns to induction drivers

11:49.520 --> 11:51.021
while I look for more power.
The weapons system?

11:51.120 --> 11:53.259
It's our only shot.
It's also a great way to die.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.709
If the heat from overloading
the capacitors doesn't fry us,

11:55.800 --> 11:58.360
the explosion will.
And yet I still wanna try it.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.984
You heard the crazy lady.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.105
(GROANING)

12:06.640 --> 12:09.347
See, now this is what I mean when
I say you're hard to shop for.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.340
I would have never thought
to buy you those.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.543
Gift from Dutch.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.141
You gotta move, Pree.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.980
You've only got so much time
before the guards come back

12:16.080 --> 12:17.741
to check on your cell.
What's the plan?

12:17.880 --> 12:18.983
TUR/V: I 7/ guide you
to engineen'ng

12:19.080 --> 12:22.379
where your lens there will uplink the
RAC security feed to the Armada.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.220
Once that's done,
I'll handle the rest.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.697
Oh, you'll handle the rest,
will you?

12:26.800 --> 12:28.062
And then we 7/ get
you out of there.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.599
Wow.
Oh.

12:33.680 --> 12:36.240
We are definitely
keeping these uniforms.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.497
What are you doing?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.977
We can take the power
from the owgen concentrator.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.422
We also won't be able
to breathe.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.306
Fine, we'll wear rebreathers.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.425
Look, Lucy can't figure
everything out for you,Johnny.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.983
I'm trying to save us here. It
still won't be enough power.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.419
And excuse me, (WHISPERS) but Lucy
needs me to figure things out.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.499
LUCY: I heard that
5h.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.706
Look, Khlyen didn't send us all this way
so that we can just die in a black hole.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.188
Who knows
with that creepy bastard?

12:59.280 --> 13:01.259
Maybe it wasn't a black hole
when he planned this.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.021
Event hon'zon /mminent.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.462
But, hey,
the way physics works,

13:04.560 --> 13:06.187
if we do get out, it could be
hundreds of years later.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.657
That brown jacket you love
might be back in style.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.349
Dutch.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.062
Sorry, Johnny.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.626
I'm not.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.585
I mean, I knew that we would
die together eventually.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.659
In a black hole, that's...

13:22.760 --> 13:24.341
That's appropriately badass.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.701
Lucy, open a comms channel.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.301
What are you doing?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.547
Sending one last message.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.777
D'av, it's John.

13:37.720 --> 13:41.099
Don't follow us to the pulsar.
And don't blame yourself.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.579
Whatever happens,
I love you.

13:50.760 --> 13:54.639
Dutch, whatever
you have to say to D'av,

13:54.720 --> 13:56.108
this is your last chance.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.347
Lucy, what just happened?
Unable to explain.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.987
External sensors are jammed

14:05.080 --> 14:07.025
Did we cross?
Is this it?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.577
Unclear. We appear
to have landed.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.420
Landed on what?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.624
Lucy, whatever's jamming you,
is it organic or man-made?

14:13.720 --> 14:17.349
A jamming signal of any kind is
unlikely to exist in a black hole.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.759
This one appears
to be man-made.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.540
Son of a snealq bitch.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.461
The pulsar's not gone.
It's hidden.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.425
By a fake black hole.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.382
It's funny.
I'm not normally this winded.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.141
It's the air.
It's thinner here.

14:35.240 --> 14:38.141
Yet you seem fine.
I got used to it on Arlqn.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.741
Save your breath.
We're close.

14:39.840 --> 14:43.617
You know, everyone asks

14:43.720 --> 14:46.143
why you never come home
to visit the estates.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.544
Well, I've been
a little busy, Yalena.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.347
Still, the 10 Families
have been vicious lately.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.226
I could have used your help.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.187
You never needed anyone's
help, let alone mine.

14:56.280 --> 14:57.349
It's not true.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.824
Even on your worst days, you're
10 steps ahead of everyone else.

15:02.240 --> 15:03.502

15:11.400 --> 15:13.584
What are you doing, Yalena?
Me?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.387
I'm struggling to breathe,
but you're fine.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.460
That pulsar burned my eyes,
but you barely blinked.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.024
Put the gun down.
Not another step.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.905
What have you become?

15:25.520 --> 15:27.977
Aneela isn't the only one
who got sick, is she?

15:28.080 --> 15:29.069
Enough.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.549
(GASPS) Khlyen!

15:36.240 --> 15:37.707
I wish you hadn't done that.

15:40.360 --> 15:41.349
JOH/V: How’s it
looking out there?

15:41.440 --> 15:42.657
Ground is solid.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.466
Still no sign of any life.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.299
I can't see anything
in this shit.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.186
Have you got
Lucy’s
sensors .
up and runn/ng?

15:50.280 --> 15:53.067
I'm working on it, but I still think
I should be out there with you.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.229

gonna go too far

15:54.320 --> 15:57.062

of what th/s place /5.

(TWIG SNAPS)

16:00.840 --> 16:02.159
Shit.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.344
Johnny, I don't think
we're alone here.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.419
I'm coming back to you.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.827
Johnny,
bit of a problem here.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.626
Yeah, way ahead of you.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.624

here, Dutch?

16:36.720 --> 16:39.177
One of you cosplayjagoffs
stop clicking around

16:39.280 --> 16:40.941
and tell me what the hells
this place is.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.905
Okay, bald aggression.
Yeah, that's a choice.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.261
Drop your weapon or die.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.665
Oh, I'm so scared.
You have a pointy stick.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.320
Dutch, stop shit-stirring
and get out Of there.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.788
We obviously got
the wrong place.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.302
Don't think so, Johnny.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.464
Patched arms.
JOHN: Yeah, I see it.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.063
What now?
DUTCH: Now?

17:02.160 --> 17:04.105
We get a little stupid.
What the hells?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.977
I am Yalena Yardeen.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.382

by Khlyen Kin Rit.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.182
Wow.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.781
Never heard you
say that before.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.303
Because it's the first
time I've ever said it.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.102
This way.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.189
Whoa, Dutch, what way?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.743
Do not follow the bad men
with pointy sticks.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.582
Sorry, Johnny, but
whatever this place is,

17:36.680 --> 17:38.545
it's exactly where
Khlyen meant me to be.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.745

we're here.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.719

18:11.800 --> 18:13.700

the whole damn place.

override the system?

What's just two?

18:17.880 --> 18:20.440
If they die, you have more.
NO.

dozen, but we're not.

18:22.680 --> 18:23.749
It's not just two.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.903
I count just two.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.860
You're really hung up
on the math, aren't you?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.503
Yes, fine.
It's just two guys.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.979

You own them.

out there, we're Killjoys.

a big deal.

to a friend of mine.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.663

19:42.760 --> 19:44.785
Well, someone's being
rather presumptuous.

19:44.880 --> 19:45.904
Then where is he?

Okay, fine, fine, fine, yes.
He may be a little dead.

(SIGHS) All right.
Here goes nothing.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.099
Come on, come on.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.625
All right, boys,
we are in!

23:09.720 --> 23:10.709
Let's get out Of here.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.508
GAREDI NO.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.817
The kids.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.183
Oh, shit.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.108
GARED: What are
they doing to them?

23:21.200 --> 23:22.747
I don't know, but if we can...
No,no,no!

23:22.880 --> 23:24.097
Gareth. ./

23:24.200 --> 23:25.986
We are not the cavalry
right now, honey bun.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.741
We are just two men
in borrowed suits

23:27.840 --> 23:29.159
and seriously outnumbered.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.743
No, no, if we try to save
those kids like this,

23:31.840 --> 23:33.979
we're dead, and so are they.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.263
Be smart.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.140
We have to come back
for them.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.617
Right away.
With an army at our back.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.982
I promise.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.181
(ALARM BLARING)

23:45.360 --> 23:46.679
(SIGHS)

23:46.760 --> 23:48.625
And things were going so well.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.940
You look just like her.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.948
How is this possible?

23:58.080 --> 24:02.426
I could try to explain,
but you may think me crazy.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.560
Well, you certainly
talk like Khlyen.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.345
I take it you know him?

24:10.280 --> 24:12.100
I take it
you're not Hullen?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.067
What with the cryopod.

24:14.160 --> 24:16.219
Do you know why
he sent you here?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.299
Not yet.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.346
But a lot's riding on me
figuring it out.

24:22.080 --> 24:26.585
So you traveled
to a distant star,

24:26.680 --> 24:30.741
braved a black hole,
made your way to me,

24:30.840 --> 24:32.705
and you don't know why?

24:35.160 --> 24:38.140
I assumed Khlyen
sent me here to kill you.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.187
(LAUGHS)

24:42.840 --> 24:45.900
Khlyen has many
faults, my dear.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.309
Willingly hurting me
was never one Of them.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.224
I wish I could
say the same.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.266
Then we knew
very different Khlyens.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.385
It's just a scratch.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.140
You'll live.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.265
That makes two of us,

25:02.360 --> 25:05.261
which is strange,
since I shot you.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.100
You're confused.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.861
You fainted
and hit your head.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.348
Fainting's for the weak.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.066
I took a very sudden nap.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.186
How did you know

25:20.800 --> 25:22.745
I was different?

25:22.840 --> 25:24.705
You didn't hold my hand.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.387
After I saw Aneela,
I was broken.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.064
And you didn't even
hold my hand.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.740
There's a coldness to you now.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.901
An emptiness
you're trying to hide.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.901
You've kept your charm

25:50.120 --> 25:53.669
I was never very good
at hiding anything from you.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.627
What happened
to you and Aneela on Arlqn?

26:03.840 --> 26:05.341
It's easier if I show you.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.223
Show me what?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.065
What all this is for.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.222
(WHISTLING)

26:26.360 --> 26:27.702
JOHN: Enjoy your nap.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.144
See? Told you
I could hit them.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.821
LUCY: I told you where
they were standing.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.263
Exactly. We're a team.
We need each other.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.100
Thats not what you said.

26:39.240 --> 26:42.186
Well, I'm a complicated
person, Lucy.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.067
I contain multitudes.
Of
bullshit?

26:45.160 --> 26:48.857
Okay, remind me to adjust your
sass
metric when I'm back.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.060
Now, where's this signal
that you're tracking?

26:52.160 --> 26:53.900
Deeper in the tunnels.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.061
YALENA: What is this place?

26:59.200 --> 27:01.065
Who lived here?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.377
If I'm right,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.739
the first to connect
with that.

27:07.560 --> 27:10.267
What is it?
It's a plasma pool.

27:10.920 --> 27:13.741
Originally, I thought it
was an organic perfectant

27:13.840 --> 27:16.502
capable of curing
all illness and disease.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.301
But inside hides
someth/ng al/en

27:20.400 --> 27:23.142
and ev/l.
’(ALE/VAZ Aneela’s voice.

27:23.240 --> 27:27.301
KHL YEN ”. Calling to her and only her
day and night driving her mad.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.100
Aneela calls her The Lady.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.421
She wants out.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.425
But I finally know
how to stop her.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.061
These plasma pools exist
within a temporal web,

27:40.160 --> 27:42.537
allowing those bonded with
the Green to communicate.

27:42.680 --> 27:45.786
But every communication
leaves a unique mark.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.440
And all Of hers
lead back to here.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.500
You're going
to silence her with goo?

27:57.600 --> 27:59.420
Targeted prion.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.102
Once I introduce this
compound into the plasma,

28:02.240 --> 28:05.186
it will infect every linked
pool like a poison dart.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.897
We'll find this Lady
wherever she hides.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.666
And this will all be over.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.422
Lucy,
you won't believe
what I'm looking at.

28:16.520 --> 28:20.263
LUCY: A magneto-optical trap used to
m/mic the properties of a black hole.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.066
How long have you
known it's here?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.469
Since I synched my sensors
to the jamming frequency,

28:24.560 --> 28:26.937
butI wanted you to feel
l/ke you found this yourself

28:27.040 --> 28:28.382
I didn't know
you could be so patronizing.

28:28.480 --> 28:30.345
I ’rn a complicated program,
Johnny.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.864
So shutting this beauty down,
that'll disable the traction pull,

28:33.960 --> 28:35.382
so we can fly
out Of here, right?

28:35.480 --> 28:38.347
It appears the energy from the
hidden pulsar is being used

28:38.440 --> 28:40.340
to power this device.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.000
Shutting it off W/l/ only open
a small window in which...

28:43.080 --> 28:44.820
We'd have to get the hells
out Of range before

28:44.920 --> 28:47.263
the magnetic pulse turns back
on and crushes us on exit.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.622
Correct.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.507
And I'm guessing that window,
it's impossibly small, right?

28:51.600 --> 28:53.306
Correct again, Johnny.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.664
(SIGHS) Yay, me.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.579
(PANTING)

29:02.280 --> 29:03.986
PREE:
What the hells is this?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.187
Oh, no.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.067
TUR/V: Thats it.
I ’rn going in to get our boys.

29:11.160 --> 29:12.229
What is your plan?

29:12.320 --> 29:15.346
Bring me every weapon, pseudo-weapon,
and potential weapon you can find.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.664
Load up the jump pod
and send me to the RAC.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.183
Figure out the rest when I get
there and start shooting faces.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.457
It's dangerous.
It's the job.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.697
TOO dangerous.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.984
The Hullen will kill you.
You are not strong enough.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.219
Now you're just being mean.
You have no plan.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.867
Well, I'm not gonna
sit here and do nothing.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.222
That's all the plan I need.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.624
LUCY: The guard I electrocuted is awake
and manually overriding my door.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.789
I can no longer contain h/m.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.547
Shit.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.380
It’s safe to assume
he’s com/ng for you.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.664
Oh, yeah?
I've never felt safer.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.906
Any luck finding Dutch?
Negaﬁve.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.584
Okay,
Lucy,
if I shut this down,
can you keep the comms Open

29:50.680 --> 29:51.897
so that I can tell _Dutch
what's happening?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.627
I hope so.

29:53.720 --> 29:54.709
Yeah, me, too.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.547
Okay, Okay, okay-

30:00.440 --> 30:01.464
Shit.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.146
(MACHINE POWERING DOWN)

30:04.280 --> 30:05.304
Okay-

30:07.480 --> 30:09.266
It's solidified.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.386
What happened?
DUTCH: Aneela.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.159
She did this to keep The
Lady from escaping.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.061
So it's over.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.422
NO.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.579
Aneela is still alive,
and so is the Green.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.386
It may be frozen,
but it's not dead.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.266
Then why are you here?

30:25.360 --> 30:26.577
You should be helping her.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.665
I will, once you give me
Khlyen's compound.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.183
Why? It's not for you.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.100
How do you know that?

30:33.800 --> 30:35.017
He would have told me.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.662
Yalena.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.623
Khlyen is gone.

30:45.200 --> 30:48.226
The only thing that's left
of him is a memory now,

30:48.320 --> 30:49.389
in the Green.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.022
Then we failed.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.343
I'm so sorry.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.537
NO.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.345
I'm the one who's sorry.

31:17.600 --> 31:21.422
But if Khlyen is dead,
it's time to destroy it all.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.579
JOH/V: Dutch,
can you hear me?

31:28.440 --> 31:30.658
Dutch, if you can hear me,
we've got a short window

31:30.760 --> 31:33.137
to get out Of here. Dutch!

31:33.240 --> 31:35.663
You're not coming through.
Say it again.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.784
Johnny?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.988
Shit.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.417
Come with me.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.977
Tough call.
Let me think. NO.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.059
Turin is my guy-

31:53.160 --> 31:54.661
If you're gonna kill me,
kill me.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.079
But_don'_t insult
my intelligence.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.427
Come with me, please.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.302
So you can string us up
and bleed us dry? Hells no.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.777
God damn it!

32:03.880 --> 32:05.780
Oh. He's with Turin.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.063
Yeah, that's definitely him.
Okay.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.344
SOLDIER: They're down here!
Get down!

32:17.480 --> 32:18.617
You are my guys.

32:21.320 --> 32:25.222
And now
I'm stuck in a cryopod.

32:25.320 --> 32:29.461
Because Khlyen sent me here.

32:31.440 --> 32:34.739
Because D'avin abandoned us.

32:34.840 --> 32:39.220
And because I let a
200-year-old lady knock me out.

32:39.320 --> 32:42.869
And because I keep taking
everyone's shit.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.066
And I am sick of it!

32:53.840 --> 32:55.501
Okay-

32:57.240 --> 32:58.867
(PANTING)

33:05.800 --> 33:09.384
Yalena,
listen to me, please.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.584
This is my fault.

33:11.680 --> 33:13.705
I made him wait.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.188
What are you not telling me?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.665
This is about more
than just Aneela.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.261
Let me do
what needs to be done.

33:20.360 --> 33:21.702
You didn't come here
to save Aneela.

33:24.280 --> 33:26.384
I came here
because I can't save her.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.342
That compound will kill
everyone linked with the Green.

33:30.440 --> 33:31.702
It's the only way to be sure.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.904
Including you and Aneela
and how many others?

33:37.440 --> 33:39.305
This is a suicide mission.

33:39.920 --> 33:41.945
That's why I didn't
want you to come.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.141
I've thought it through.
It's the rational choice.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.628
NO.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.426
You don't get
to calculate the odds

33:48.520 --> 33:50.340
and cut ties with our daughter
when there's still any chance

33:50.440 --> 33:51.577
we can save her.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.719
You have too much
faith in me, Yala.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.506
That has never once been true.

33:58.640 --> 34:01.905
Khlyen Kin Rit, I have known
you since our sixth summer

34:03.960 --> 34:05.541
and loved you since our 12th.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.739
I've never seen you quit once.
I won't help you do it now.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.307
I'm trying to do
what's right.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.389
Then fight.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.504
The moment you know
the battle is lost,

34:19.360 --> 34:20.497
truly lost,

34:22.680 --> 34:26.343
I will use this, and I will
kill this Lady myself,

34:26.440 --> 34:27.782
but not until then.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.703
I know that
you're still in there.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.467
That you still feel for us.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.222
It's just an echo.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.869
But I think our echo is still more
than most people ever get to feel.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.457
Then don't you dare
give up on us.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.979
Yalena,
give me the canister.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.826
Don't destroy it.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.784
We failed.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.984
We haven't failed.

35:10.080 --> 35:12.457
I just haven't won yet.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.300
Here's what I want.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.140
TO save Aneela,
destroy The Lady,

35:16.240 --> 35:19.346
and have a gods damn
normal life again.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.737
Will you help me?

35:25.480 --> 35:26.799
What is Aneela to you?

35:33.680 --> 35:34.942
She is my family.

35:37.840 --> 35:38.909
Like you.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.585
So don't you dare
give up on me.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.497
One request.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.580
If you can't do
the impossible,

36:05.400 --> 36:06.788
do the honorable.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.381
The thing I couldn't do.

36:12.360 --> 36:13.622
You promise me

36:16.800 --> 36:19.985
that you will end Aneela
if you can't save her.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.267
LUCY: St/l/ no response
from Dutch.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.737
Try again.
Her comm must be damaged.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.541
We are running
out of time, John.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.619
Okay, no problem, I'll just
go back into the caves,

36:41.760 --> 36:43.466
past the angry
bloodthirsty guards,

36:43.560 --> 36:45.460
turn the machine off again,
and go find Dutch myself.

36:45.560 --> 36:46.663
How W/l/ you find her?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.102
He could try bloody looking.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.657
Nice Of you to join us.
Nice Of you to wait.

36:50.760 --> 36:52.466
Lucy, get us
out Of here.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.777
We ’re cutting it
very close, John.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.541
If we don ’t break clear

36:55.640 --> 36:57.460
before the security fie/d
resumes, we could
be...

36:57.560 --> 37:00.825
Splatty and dead, I get it.
Now push this shit.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.501
You Okay?

37:02.600 --> 37:03.669
You find what
you need in there?

37:03.760 --> 37:07.821
Yeah, I did.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.746
DUTCH:
I could take you
with me, you know.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.700
YALENA: No.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.946
Khlyen W/l/ find
his way back to me.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.860
He always does.

37:24.800 --> 37:26.904
And I ’0' like to skin all the
dramatic bits in between,

37:27.000 --> 37:28.467
thank you.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.342
_ You have a lot Of faith
in someone who's let you down.

37:31.440 --> 37:36.742
Well, it's a very hard life if
you only have faith in yourself.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.023
But a safer one.

37:40.160 --> 37:44.506
When you last saw Aneela
outside the Green,

37:46.200 --> 37:47.383
was she happy?

37:50.000 --> 37:54.664
In her way, she found
her perfect match.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.700
And are you happy?

38:01.200 --> 38:02.940
(SCOFFS)

38:03.040 --> 38:04.746
I'm fine.

38:05.560 --> 38:08.063
There are more important
things in the middle of a war

38:08.160 --> 38:09.422
where everything might end.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.657
Anger's good,

38:12.120 --> 38:15.146
until it hurts you
more than it heals you.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.821
And when you're ready,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.423
I hope you choose
to let yours go.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.021
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

38:39.920 --> 38:41.308
Gotta hand it to you, Pree.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.777
For a bartender, you make
a pretty good recon scout.

38:43.880 --> 38:47.941
Gingersnap, for the last time, I
make a pretty good everything.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.860
ZEPH: Do the showers
in this place work yet?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.461
Because I need five of them.

38:51.560 --> 38:52.663
PREE:Hey!

38:52.880 --> 38:54.268
I thought you were
coming with Pip.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.419
Where _is he?
Resting.

38:56.560 --> 38:58.300
From what?

38:58.440 --> 39:01.182
A really bad headache.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.907
TURIN: Speaking of headaches,
take a look at this.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.079
We have full eyes on the RAC,
thanks to my guy, Weej.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.301
Are you serious right now?

39:09.760 --> 39:11.819
Next thing we have to do
is get those kids back.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.662
Yeah, and then we take back
our goddamn ship.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.897
Our home.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.507
Wait.

39:17.600 --> 39:18.988
Look what she's dripping.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.419
It must be plasma.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.704
Pure and unfrozen.

39:25.840 --> 39:28.479
The Lady has a Greenpool.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.827
So this is how
we kill The Lady.

39:33.920 --> 39:37.185
With some tweaks, hopefully.
Once we get Aneela out.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.098
Just you and me still, or...

39:40.200 --> 39:42.418
(SOUL MUSIC PLAYING)

39:44.120 --> 39:45.781
Why did you come along?

39:45.880 --> 39:47.984
Because you asked.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.786
'Cause...
We're family?

39:53.240 --> 39:54.343
So is he.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.222
And family don't give up on each other.
I know that much.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.381
And despite what
Khlyen did to me,

40:02.480 --> 40:04.744
I may be damaged,
but I'm not broken.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.906
(LUCY CHIMING)

40:09.080 --> 40:12.060
is
everything all right, girl? LUCY:
Your message to D'avin was received-

40:12.160 --> 40:13.707
Well, hey, now.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.984
Did he send anything back?
Maybe a nice apology?

40:16.080 --> 40:19.777
No, because it wasn ’t
D’avin who received it.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.337
Then who did’?
Unidenth‘ied

40:22.480 --> 40:25.460
But I recognize the intake
transm/ssion rece/pt headers.

40:25.560 --> 40:26.663
They’re Black Root shins.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.898
They must be following D'av.

40:31.000 --> 40:32.786
NO.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.620
No, they're following the kid.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.745
Based on the coordinates
of the t/me of receipt;

40:36.840 --> 40:40.389
I believe they are in the J sub-system
that includes the planet Te/en.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.027
Telen, isn't that
where you're from?

40:42.120 --> 40:44.065
And if D'av
took the kid there...

40:44.160 --> 40:45.866
Then the Hullen are
headed right for them.
