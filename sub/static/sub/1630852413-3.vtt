WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.217
I'll handle it, Ana.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.971
You have five minutes to leave.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.848
Or else, I'll call the police.

00:17.934 --> 00:19.185
Are you insane?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.813
It's 2:00 a.m., asshole!
What's wrong with you?

00:22.522 --> 00:24.315
Is my baby girl asleep?

00:24.399 --> 00:25.942
Bring her so I can see her.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.487
Like this? Regina would get drunk
just from smelling you.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.156
I miss her, Mariana.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.034
I'm entitled to see her, aren't I?

00:34.117 --> 00:37.912
I'm also entitled to kick you out
if you don't leave right now.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.665
Don't make me take drastic measures.

00:40.749 --> 00:44.419
What measures? Don't be ridiculous,
you can't even stand upright.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.006
I'll sue you for… ali…

00:48.089 --> 00:50.091
Parental "allination."

00:50.175 --> 00:52.844
It's parental alienation.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.723
It sounds funny,
but has nothing to do with aliens.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.311
Listen, Mariana, the law is on my side.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.315
What's the point of involving lawyers

01:05.398 --> 01:07.358
and judges in this?

01:07.442 --> 01:08.943
We can come to an arrangement.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.737
Forget it, Pablo, no way.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.656
And tomorrow,
when your hangover is killing you,

01:13.740 --> 01:16.743
I hope you realize
how much bullshit you just said.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.913
Oh… she slammed the door in my face.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.122
No, no.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.292
You'll regret this!

01:27.378 --> 01:30.006
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:29.816 --> 02:33.319
Ceci, please ask your father
to hand me a napkin, will you?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.613
Sure. Dad, will you--? Okay, thanks.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.949
-Here, Mom.
-Thank you, dear.

02:40.910 --> 02:44.873
Rodrigo, tell your mom
she has sauce on her chin.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.499
Right here, Mom.

02:51.212 --> 02:53.882
No, Rodrigo,
please tell her it's a little bit lower.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.426
A bit lower.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.763
What's going on?

03:00.847 --> 03:03.099
This always happens
after they've had a fight.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.768
Sweetie, how is
your science project going?

03:05.852 --> 03:08.021
Great, Mom, I just need you to check it.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.648
-Can you check it right now?
-No, sweetie, I have to go.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.025
I can do it.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.571
No, thanks, Dad. I can wait until tonight.

03:19.908 --> 03:20.783
My darling.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.784
Vale.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.247
-Oh, baby!
-She's been laughing a lot lately.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.875
-Really?
-Yes, she likes raspberries. Vale!

03:30.585 --> 03:32.629
-Yes.
-So cute.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.547
Hey, careful.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.924
Here, Vale.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.050
Sweetie!

03:44.098 --> 03:44.933
Here.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.226
There, there.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.603
Who likes raspberries?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.275
Alta, will you bring us more juice?

03:54.359 --> 03:55.818
Please, thank you.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.782
Oh, come on. Come to Mommy.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.617
-Come to Mama.
-Yes, go to Mommy.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.995
Stop, you'll make her throw up.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.122
What? She was having a blast.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.961
Kids, tell your dad he's being absurd.
She's not having a blast.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.921
She's just a little gassy.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.756
She says…

04:16.839 --> 04:18.508
You're the dad, bro, for God's sake!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.843
Please, I'm not suing her.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.638
I just wanted to scare her
so she'd let me see the girl.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.140
Conrado says
she kicked you out with a pistol.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.476
No, I said she had eyes like a pistol.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.187
I say you sue her. Use your lawyer friend.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.439
I don't know,
she'll come around on her own.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.609
When has Mariana ever been reasonable?
Don't be a pussy, dude.

04:37.360 --> 04:41.239
When we actually file a lawsuit,
Mariana will negotiate, bro.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.240
You think so?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.534
-No!
-Goal, goal.

04:44.617 --> 04:45.493
Goal.

04:45.576 --> 04:46.703
Trust me, dude.

04:47.745 --> 04:48.913
Yeah, dude.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.624
-That's what I mean. We're men here.
-You bet we are!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.301
Oh, my sweet baby.

05:03.052 --> 05:07.473
Maybe if you spend more time
with Valentina you'll bond with her.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.226
-The problem--
-I have no bonding issues with my baby.

05:11.060 --> 05:14.439
She's not laughing
because Juan Carlos almost made her vomit.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.775
I don't need your advice
on how to raise my daughter.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.495
Hello.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.998
Hello, you!

05:34.709 --> 05:36.794
Why did you take this route, Ramón?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.422
You know the stoplights
are always out of sync.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.424
I followed Waze, ma'am.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.099
Ana… it's me!

05:50.600 --> 05:52.560
Oh, hey!

05:52.643 --> 05:55.021
Hey, girl! How was your delivery?

05:55.104 --> 05:57.273
-Super great.
-Oh, I'm glad.

05:57.857 --> 05:58.733
You have no idea,

05:58.816 --> 06:01.903
we've missed you at bridge, all of us.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.322
The girls wanted to go to the hospital.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.742
I said it was uncalled for,
because when you've just given birth

06:07.825 --> 06:11.120
the last thing you want are visitors. 
Especially at your age.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.957
Anyway, it went great.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.709
-Really?
-Yes, yes.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.045
That hospital treats you like a queen.

06:19.128 --> 06:22.340
-I know.
-I felt as if at the Four Seasons.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.342
Yeah. I saw the pictures you posted.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.345
Those pictures
didn't do the suite justice.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.764
-But what mattered was the baby.
-Sure.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.766
-She must be so huge.
-Huge.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.684
-A giant!
-Yes.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.603
We're all dying to meet her.

06:36.104 --> 06:40.024
So, we're playing bridge
at your house on Friday, okay?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.026
You mean this Friday?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.654
Yes, I'll send it to our group.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.490
Friday at Ana's.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.536
-Don't you cancel on us.
-No.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.956
-Love you!
-Okay, great. Bye.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.918
This is the last time
we take this route, Ramón.

06:59.001 --> 06:59.836
Sorry, ma'am.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.337
Hello?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.172
Ms. Mariana Herrera?

07:03.673 --> 07:06.092
I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. Conrado Fuentes

07:06.175 --> 07:09.387
to schedule negotiations
with our client, Pablo Sandoval.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.056
Mr. Conrado asked me
to deliver this message.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.476
If you refuse to negotiate,
things can get really ugly.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.399
Your wannabe dad is an asshole, sweetie.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.192
NANNY WHIP

07:23.276 --> 07:24.652
Hello, darlings.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.571
I am Nanny Whip.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.323
On this video, I will force you

07:29.407 --> 07:33.244
to learn humiliation
and punishment techniques.

07:33.327 --> 07:36.372
For that naughty boy you have at home.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.002
Nanny Whip has great tips.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.755
Yes. I mean, yes, but…

07:45.423 --> 07:47.300
I asked for bonding videos.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.011
You know, bonding.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.391
Damn autocorrect.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.477
I think, bro, that this time…

07:58.227 --> 08:01.022
you should call time of death
on your marriage, brother.

08:01.105 --> 08:04.484
No, way, Víctor.
We've been married for 20 years.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.487
That's exactly why.
Fuck, 20 years is a long time.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.447
And when love runs out, it just does.

08:09.530 --> 08:14.702
Are you spending the next 20 years
going through the motions?

08:15.578 --> 08:16.412
Do you love her?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.832
Of course I love her.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.043
She's my kids' mother.
Don't be ridiculous.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.670
Don't give me
that "my kids' mother" bullshit.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.131
I want a real answer.
Do you still love her?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.803
There's something to think about.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.680
I'll shower. See you at the office.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.435
FUNBOREE
EARLY STIMULATION

08:39.519 --> 08:41.103
-This is it. This one.
-Yes.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.314
-This actually looks fun.
-Yes.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.942
How do people have time for this?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.985
It's only during office hours.

08:48.069 --> 08:51.113
My cousin works in one
that's for working moms.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.490
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

08:52.573 --> 08:54.951
-Only overachiever babies go there.
-That's it.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.620
-That sounds like the perfect place.
-Yes.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.705
-Yes. Please.
-I'll sign you up.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.541
Thanks. Who would've thought?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.793
-Pablo isn't here.
-Are you sure?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.127
I just heard his voice.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.839
My client, Mr. Sandoval, isn't here, okay?

09:08.923 --> 09:12.218
Conrado, quit the bullshit.
Pablo never leaves early.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.804
-Mr. Conrado, to you.
-Don't be stupid.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.597
Let me in. Pablo!

09:16.681 --> 09:17.765
Pablo!

09:18.266 --> 09:19.141
Mariana?

09:20.017 --> 09:22.353
-Where's the baby?
-She's at home with the nanny.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.980
No way I'd bring her here.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.817
Anything you have to say
to my client, you can say to me first.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.528
Pablo, you're crazy.
You're suing me, really?

09:30.611 --> 09:33.155
Since when do you listen to this idiot?
For fuck's sake!

09:33.239 --> 09:36.450
"Idiot." This won't look good in court.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.246
-What court, Pablo?
-You left him no choice, Mrs. Herrera.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.748
I'm no "Mrs." How dare you? Hey, Pablo!

09:43.332 --> 09:44.542
You're shitting me!

09:45.167 --> 09:47.712
Pablo… be a man, damn it.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.884
No, Mom, I don't want you to call him.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.096
I was just venting.
I don't want you to call Pablo.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.516
Besides, you won't fix a thing
by calling him.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.269
No, we won't beg at his feet.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.480
You know what?
If he wants to sue me, let him sue me.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.441
Yes.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.986
I have to go, Mom.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.322
We'll talk tomorrow. I love you too.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.198
Bye.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.784
-Who's suing you?
-That idiot, Pablo.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.538
His friend talked him into suing me
for visitation rights.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.999
-After what he did to me.
-What did he do?

10:25.583 --> 10:26.417
Tell me.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.838
This one's from my grandma. Isn't it cute?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.177
What's wrong?

10:37.386 --> 10:40.097
I've been thinking, Mariana,
I'm not ready to be a dad.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.476
At least not right now.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.730
"Not right now"?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.734
I'm not offering you a beer.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.614
You could've said so five months ago.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.991
Sorry, I didn't know what I was saying.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.661
What am I supposed to do about this?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.166
You said we'd be together forever.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.089
Sorry, Mariana, I just realized
how much trouble having a baby is.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.465
Fuck you!

11:21.514 --> 11:22.848
"Fuck you."

11:23.432 --> 11:24.934
Let's spice it up with "dumbass."

11:26.268 --> 11:30.564
"Those were the words that the defendant

11:30.648 --> 11:36.153
used in an unwarranted
and unnecessary fashion

11:36.904 --> 11:39.573
to refer to my client."

11:40.116 --> 11:42.284
Yes, just add that I was happy at first.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.912
"I must also underscore

11:44.995 --> 11:47.289
that my client

11:47.373 --> 11:51.043
was very… happy."

11:52.795 --> 11:54.130
I'm going to be a dad?

12:10.354 --> 12:12.314
This is the best present ever.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.859
Are you crying?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.194
Sorry, tears of joy.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.867
You and I will be together forever.

12:23.492 --> 12:27.371
So… you don't think
we should have an abortion?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.708
What? No, no, Mariana.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.755
You and I love each other.
This baby is proof of that.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.757
Imagine how cute it'll be.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.258
With your eyes.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.177
My nose.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.637
She doesn't have your nose.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.098
What? Mariana says I have a button nose.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.102
Sure. What happened next?

12:50.186 --> 12:51.437
What do you mean?

12:52.021 --> 12:55.775
-It all went to shit thanks to you.
-Hell no! How is it my fault?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.485
You fucking idiot.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.945
Are you really having a baby right now?

13:00.446 --> 13:03.491
Holy shit, dude. Your life is over.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.118
Why didn't you get an abortion?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.828
I don't know, dude.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.248
Five months?
And you're only telling us now? Fuck!

13:11.332 --> 13:14.376
First, we wanted to know
if it was a boy or a girl.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.004
And to make matters worse,
you're having a girl.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.299
What if she brings home
a pothead boyfriend like him?

13:21.592 --> 13:22.760
Father-in-law.

13:22.843 --> 13:23.928
Gramps!

13:24.512 --> 13:27.890
You should bail, man, before it gets ugly.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.725
No, we won't include that.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.019
It's not relevant information.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.483
Pablo sounds like a real jerk.
And he never came back?

13:37.566 --> 13:40.903
Not until now.
Turns out he wants to be a dad after all.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.363
Well, you're right.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.950
Hey, I don't want
that jerk near the girls either.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.746
Go see Laura Villa tomorrow,
she's the best lawyer in Mexico.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.581
A real shark.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.751
If Pablo wants to fight,
we'll give him a fight.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.669
Okay.

13:57.169 --> 14:00.798
There's my sweet baby!

14:00.881 --> 14:03.050
Oh, my Valentina.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.313
Don't worry about it,
it's a matter of time.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.872
Go to sleep, Mom.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.666
I'll finish it.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.585
No, honey, we'll do it together.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.171
Oh, the letters are turning out great.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.382
They're better than the old ones.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.594
Yes. Dad wouldn't have pushed me.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.636
I would've lost.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.224
No, Ro. Don't judge him.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.811
But you were the first to laugh
when he offered his help.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.188
Yes, and it was wrong.

14:59.607 --> 15:04.361
Dad is good at some things
and I'm good at others. That's why…

15:04.862 --> 15:07.406
we complement each other
and make a great team.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.454
Look, is this okay?

15:19.543 --> 15:23.589
I'll be home late today,
I'm taking Valentina to Funboree.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.091
I want to spend more time with her.

15:27.301 --> 15:30.262
-I'll go Tuesdays and Thursdays, okay?
-Okay.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.599
Mom, this Thursday
is my science fair, you always come.

15:33.682 --> 15:34.767
Oh, sweetie.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.811
What if something goes wrong, ma'am?

15:37.895 --> 15:40.314
We don't want Rodri to lose.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.774
Nothing will go wrong.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.151
Everything will be okay.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.111
I'll go with you, okay?

15:46.695 --> 15:48.238
Yes, that's a great idea.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.117
And I think you spending
more time with Valentina is a great idea.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.120
That's what it's about, huh? Being a team.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.421
Look, darling!

16:05.881 --> 16:07.132
Look, hey!

16:16.266 --> 16:18.018
Blow slower.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.689
I know how to make bubbles. Thanks.

16:25.484 --> 16:28.028
Sorry I'm late, I had to stop by the vet.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.406
But you know what I mean,

16:30.489 --> 16:32.366
since we're both mothers.

16:32.449 --> 16:37.913
Ana already let me in on your case
and that huge jerk, Pablo.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.040
All men are the same.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.291
Right, Marjorie?

16:41.375 --> 16:43.293
That's why Daddy can't see you anymore.

16:43.377 --> 16:49.091
Still, he has to pay
for her shots, grooming and therapy.

16:49.633 --> 16:50.884
There's a lot we can do.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.970
Get him the electric chair?

16:53.470 --> 16:56.807
No, I'm afraid
there's no death penalty in Mexico.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.308
I was kidding.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.813
First come the ants

17:02.896 --> 17:04.898
They're all good friends

17:04.982 --> 17:07.484
They march in a row

17:07.568 --> 17:09.570
They'll run together

17:12.448 --> 17:13.907
Maybe she doesn't like music.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.617
Some babies aren't musical.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.036
She loves music.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.330
Since the womb, she listened 
to Rachmaninoff, she loves it.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.751
But thanks anyway.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.085
Mariana, this is no joke.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.379
Pablo can get custody of your girl.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.338
What?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.215
Well, he can try.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.759
But don't worry,

17:31.842 --> 17:34.344
I've never lost a case.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.722
Do you remember #ScrewMen?

17:37.639 --> 17:39.141
I made it a trending topic.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.478
You're in very good hands.
Trust me. Right, Marjorie?

17:44.396 --> 17:46.982
Nimo the bunny hid

17:47.066 --> 17:48.776
Boo! He hid

17:48.859 --> 17:51.403
Boo! He hid, boo!

17:52.029 --> 17:54.323
He hid behind his ears

17:54.406 --> 17:58.577
Boo! He taught me the peekaboo game

17:59.369 --> 18:01.997
He hid behind a scarf

18:03.165 --> 18:05.918
And he blew it away

18:06.001 --> 18:09.797
Boo! He taught me the peekaboo game

18:12.091 --> 18:14.176
She's not following you.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.012
Well, it's this "rabbit" thing.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.723
Valentina is too sophisticated for that.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.976
Or you should spend more time with her.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.064
I'm doing the best I can.
My work is time-consuming.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.111
It's different for those of us
with high-responsibility jobs.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.157
Yes. Well, Rebecca is 
the Creative Director at Walter Bronson.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.827
And Leticia has
her own real-estate agency.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.664
And, in fact, I am the CEO
of a food-packaging company.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.707
And look how good she follows my "boo!"

18:50.754 --> 18:54.341
There's a great pedagogue,
Harriet Lupkiss.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.261
She's an expert on bonding
and early development.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.471
-If you want, I--
-I know who she is, thanks.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
I've read all her books.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.937
Why are you reading this crap?

19:07.020 --> 19:09.231
Her methods are outdated.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.149
Really?

19:10.649 --> 19:12.776
Who do you recommend?

19:12.860 --> 19:16.363
Please don't say Nanny Whip,
that woman is scary.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.198
No, I don't know who that is.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.160
I read several authors
as research for my app.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.454
And I think
I could recommend Peter Locust.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.707
He's essential
for understanding Betsy Nest.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.168
Although, on second thought, for this age

19:29.251 --> 19:31.670
it would be good
if you started with Walter Crenshaw.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.547
He's great for a baby's first months.

19:33.630 --> 19:37.509
Yes, okay. But I don't have 
the time to read all that.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.304
I know!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.347
Why don't you come to Funboree with me?

19:42.431 --> 19:46.602
I'm better at hands-on learning,
maybe you can give me tips.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.188
Okay, sure, I always wanted to go 
to a place like that.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.105
Really?

19:50.606 --> 19:51.565
It's settled, then.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.734
Do you think I wanted to invite them?

19:53.817 --> 19:55.569
Well, just uninvite them, Ana.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.405
Why do you care
about those bridge-playing snakes?

19:58.488 --> 20:00.699
That's precisely why,
because they're snakes.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.786
I thought going
to Funboree was for Valentina's sake.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.746
Yeah.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.249
That too.
That way, I kill two birds with one stone.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.169
When did we start having
such different views in life?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.503
What are you saying?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.632
Maybe we should go to couples therapy.

20:18.050 --> 20:18.884
No.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.554
I know a lot of things
have changed lately,

20:22.638 --> 20:25.849
but there's no need
to tell our problems to a stranger.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.312
No, you and I
can fix all our problems alone.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.733
I'm going to bed.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.284
Mariana…

20:45.035 --> 20:46.828
We agreed you wouldn't speak.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.248
Remember, anything you say
can be used against you.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.460
Marjorie.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.419
Behave.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.756
She just hates the smell of testosterone.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.718
It's nice to see you, Conrado.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.304
She was my teacher in college.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.723
You didn't pass my class.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.766
Colleague…

21:08.392 --> 21:12.646
we should negotiate
to reach the best outcome.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.356
Negotiate? Conrado, no.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.235
We, my client and I,
are not here to negotiate.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.613
The only reason we're here today

21:22.197 --> 21:26.493
is to insist you drop
such a ridiculous lawsuit.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.744
Ridiculous?

21:27.828 --> 21:31.039
For starters, it's riddled
with spelling mistakes, but…

21:31.540 --> 21:34.418
since that's not the subject I teach,
we'll ignore that.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.129
On the other hand,
I did a background check

21:37.212 --> 21:39.423
on your client, Mr. Sandoval.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.426
What I found is quite alarming.

21:42.509 --> 21:45.762
He lives in the service room
of an overcrowded building.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.681
Well, lower rent costs.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.393
And he has
a marijuana plant in his bedroom

21:52.436 --> 21:56.023
-You told her about the plant?
-No, I didn't. I swear.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.234
Your client could end up in jail,
colleague.

22:00.152 --> 22:00.986
Jail?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.780
But Mariana is the one that has a minor

22:03.864 --> 22:06.575
kidnapped at a stranger's house.

22:06.658 --> 22:10.078
Oh, right. Because her mommy
had no money to pay for rent.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.997
Did you tell him about my mom?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.540
Not a word, no.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.084
You graduated two years ago
and you're not practicing.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.669
At least I have a job.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.881
-I'm creative and handle social media.
-Like mine.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.593
I was working on a maternity app with you,
I don't know if you remember.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.094
Yes, you bailed on it.

22:26.178 --> 22:29.389
Just as you bailed on me
when I was pregnant. Remember?

22:29.473 --> 22:32.059
Yes, but then you dated a chick.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.769
A lesbian!

22:33.852 --> 22:36.813
What kind of example is that
for the girl? Huh?

22:37.564 --> 22:39.483
Conrado, I am a lesbian.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.068
I'm sorry, ma'am.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.487
That's not what I meant.

22:43.570 --> 22:45.280
You're a sexist caveman.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.990
And you're an uncaring mother.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.575
Fuck you!

22:52.913 --> 22:54.915
I guess I'll see you in court.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.962
Conrado, when will you finish
the assignment you owe me?

23:01.546 --> 23:06.218
Remember, this is your last chance
to improve your grade, colleague.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.428
I'm almost done, ma'am.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.430
Make yourselves at home.

23:13.934 --> 23:14.976
What, dude?

23:15.519 --> 23:18.188
I just have to do a spellcheck,
that's all.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.439
He can't find out,

23:19.523 --> 23:22.317
but Laura said we can get full custody.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.737
Are you sure that's what you want to do?

23:27.489 --> 23:29.783
I think the girl needs her father.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.368
Oh, what for, Mom?

23:31.451 --> 23:33.453
So he can break her heart? No.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.956
Sometimes it's better not to have a dad.

23:36.039 --> 23:36.873
Come on…

23:37.707 --> 23:40.627
You would've liked Anuar
to have been there for you, right?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.463
Why take that away from Regina?

23:47.175 --> 23:48.677
You said she'd negotiate.

23:49.344 --> 23:51.763
You said we had it in the bag.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.557
Fucking idiot.

23:54.516 --> 23:56.768
Well, these procedures are long.

23:57.436 --> 24:02.274
But when Regina turns 18, she'll be able
to decide if she wants to see you or not.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.193
When she's 18?

24:06.069 --> 24:07.821
No way, dude.

24:07.904 --> 24:10.365
Well, kids grow very fast.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.451
And girls even faster.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.497
Just follow my lead, okay?

24:17.581 --> 24:19.249
What lead?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.003
Hello.

24:23.503 --> 24:24.504
Ana.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.215
I thought you wouldn't be back,

24:27.299 --> 24:29.301
given how bad it went last time.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.304
I assume she's your eldest?

24:33.472 --> 24:36.141
Who, her? No, she's Mariana, my au pair.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.894
And this is her daughter Regina.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.813
Oh, she's beautiful.
I'm glad you brought her.

24:41.897 --> 24:45.692
Too bad this place
isn't really affordable for everyone.

24:45.775 --> 24:46.902
You'll love it.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.405
Hey, I was just reading Harriet Lupkiss…

24:50.989 --> 24:52.616
this wonderful pedagogue.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.828
She says we should start this
when they're two-months old.

24:56.912 --> 25:01.249
But Harriet Lupkiss' theories
are way too obsolete, Christie.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.669
I get why you brought her up,
she's very mainstream, right?

25:04.753 --> 25:07.714
But there are better authors,

25:07.797 --> 25:08.965
way more advanced.

25:09.049 --> 25:09.925
Yes.

25:10.717 --> 25:13.678
Mariana didn't know a lot about
early development at first,

25:13.762 --> 25:15.972
but I've taught her quite a bit, right?

25:16.056 --> 25:16.890
Oh, yeah.

25:16.973 --> 25:20.352
Yeah, my boss knows a lot
about early development.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.396
I mean, I know a little.
I just read so much.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.150
Tell Christie
about the authors I showed you.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.401
Which is your favorite?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.653
-There's lots.
-Yes.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.113
Peter Locust, for instance.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.491
Essential for understanding…

25:35.575 --> 25:39.538
But, truth is, the one I like the most
for this particular age is…

25:40.914 --> 25:42.082
Yes, exactly.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.880
HANS BREMEL SCHOOL - SCIENCE FAIR

25:48.964 --> 25:51.800
And so, it's not as exact,
for the elements that define

25:51.883 --> 25:55.053
the stability of the chemical
and atomic components…

25:55.136 --> 25:56.805
CHEMICAL BONDS

25:56.888 --> 25:57.722
Are…

26:00.433 --> 26:02.477
atoms with two charges,

26:02.561 --> 26:05.772
one positive and one negative.

26:06.648 --> 26:07.983
And they vibrate…

26:09.693 --> 26:10.694
They vibrate…

26:12.988 --> 26:14.656
and never stop vibrating.

26:17.659 --> 26:18.785
And…

26:51.026 --> 26:51.860
What happened?

26:51.943 --> 26:53.612
Nothing, I got nervous.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.449
I also get nervous when I speak in public.

26:58.825 --> 26:59.951
You know what I do?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.371
You picture the audience naked?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.456
How did you know?

27:04.998 --> 27:07.334
You got that from a movie, Dad.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.295
That doesn't mean it doesn't work.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.340
Imagine the judges naked.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.093
They're old.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.219
Well…

27:18.928 --> 27:20.680
imagine some hot girls.

27:24.559 --> 27:25.518
Shall we?

27:38.239 --> 27:39.741
This exercise works wonders,

27:39.824 --> 27:42.285
kids learn the colors very fast.

27:42.952 --> 27:43.787
Ana…

27:44.287 --> 27:46.665
Yes, I know, I read the color book.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.167
No, it's not for them to learn the colors.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.377
It is, Christie.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.254
Otherwise, the parachute
would have only one color, not many.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.673
The book that I…

27:54.756 --> 27:58.510
You have it at home so Valentina
can see it when she knows the colors.

27:58.593 --> 27:59.761
Remember?

28:04.140 --> 28:05.392
What are you doing?

28:05.475 --> 28:06.726
Christie is right.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.229
I don't care,
you made me look like a fool.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.022
And you said I was your nanny.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.982
-We agreed on that.
-Did we?

28:13.066 --> 28:13.900
-Yes.
-When?

28:16.194 --> 28:18.113
My baby!

28:20.281 --> 28:21.408
My baby!

28:22.617 --> 28:24.160
So, my advice didn't work.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.287
-Did you do as I said?
-Yes.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.790
But picturing hot girls
only distracted me.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.625
Second place isn't bad.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.502
We were only two in my field.

28:32.585 --> 28:35.088
You both did great. It was a tie to me.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.340
But I always win.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.092
Like my mom.

28:40.844 --> 28:42.762
It's good to lose sometimes, Ro.

28:44.013 --> 28:47.100
I've never been more embarrassed.

28:47.183 --> 28:50.687
It's your fault I got kicked out
of the only Funboree I could go to.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.398
No, it's your fault
for living off appearances.

28:53.481 --> 28:55.650
-Forget it. You don't get it.
-I don't.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.570
I don't get why you care
what others think of you.

28:59.154 --> 29:01.656
I just wanted Valentina to smile at me.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.578
Don't beat yourself up.

29:07.996 --> 29:08.872
Look…

29:10.915 --> 29:13.418
I won this at a speech contest
back at high school.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.628
It's blank.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.466
I know. It's a participation medal.
I really sucked.

29:21.176 --> 29:23.511
We can tell Mom you won first place.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.140
It'll be our secret.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.938
PABLO - PLEASE, MARIANA :(

29:36.483 --> 29:39.402
If your mom catches us,
we'll remind her how much she lies.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.070
Yes.

29:41.154 --> 29:44.032
Dad, I had fun with you
at the science fair.

29:45.533 --> 29:46.951
-Really?
-Yes.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.745
Mom and you make a great team.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.538
I like having the both of you.

30:04.594 --> 30:05.678
No.

30:07.806 --> 30:08.640
Okay.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.391
Pablo!

30:13.186 --> 30:14.145
Mariana?

30:16.356 --> 30:17.440
Why are you here?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.943
I've been thinking and…

30:20.652 --> 30:22.737
despite what we said, I--

30:22.821 --> 30:24.030
Forgive me.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.032
I'm sorry too.

30:27.867 --> 30:28.910
Come in.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.334
Look…

30:36.835 --> 30:38.294
I know that…

30:38.795 --> 30:40.797
there's all kinds of families.

30:40.880 --> 30:45.176
In mine, we were my mom,
my grandma and I, and…

30:45.677 --> 30:47.679
It was great, but…

30:48.179 --> 30:51.474
it still hurts me
not having a relationship with my dad.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.894
If you're willing, I don't want
to deny my daughter that right.

30:59.607 --> 31:00.733
Look, look.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.152
Go to Daddy, huh?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.488
Hello, baby.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.407
Hello, princess.

31:07.490 --> 31:08.741
Hello.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.451
Hi!

31:11.077 --> 31:13.371
Hey, how are you?

31:15.790 --> 31:17.625
Of course I'm willing, Mariana.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.961
This is what I want the most.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.089
Okay, but you can't back down now, okay?

31:24.257 --> 31:25.633
Oh, so cute.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.637
I think you should both
sign an agreement so that--

31:29.721 --> 31:31.556
-You shut up, dude!
-Shut up, dude.

31:37.687 --> 31:39.689
Princess, princess

31:39.772 --> 31:41.232
But one day I'll tell her

31:41.316 --> 31:43.860
we smoked the marijuana plant together.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.905
Yes, baby. Yes.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.115
-Your mom was a stoner.
-Not true.

31:49.198 --> 31:51.618
Yes, she made huge joints,
like Snoop Dogg.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.994
Yes, yes.

31:54.537 --> 31:56.789
Oh, she's so beautiful.

31:56.873 --> 31:57.707
Laugh.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.959
You like me, don't you?

32:09.594 --> 32:10.428
Ana.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.848
I want to apologize.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.559
I wasn't fair to you at the Funboree.

32:18.436 --> 32:21.940
All I wanted was to spend
quality time with Valentina.

32:22.023 --> 32:22.941
I know.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.361
You don't have to go 
to a Funboree for that anyway.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.362
No?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.990
She hasn't smiled at me once.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.785
Will you let me help you?

32:34.619 --> 32:37.205
Oh, right, you're the expert.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.623
No, I'm not.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.626
Please, neither of us are experts
and we don't know everything.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.461
But, look, maybe…

32:43.962 --> 32:47.423
if you stopped worrying
about whether she laughs or not

32:47.507 --> 32:51.344
and just play with her,
have fun, try to enjoy it.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.098
Come on, try it.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.478
Hello, darling.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.814
Hi, darling.

33:03.523 --> 33:05.108
Who's my baby girl?

33:05.191 --> 33:08.194
Oh! She's laughing!

33:08.987 --> 33:10.029
Did you see that?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.198
She laughed.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.583
You won, friend!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.211
What was that play?

33:25.294 --> 33:27.964
I got confused, friend,
I thought we had her.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.300
-Good game.
-Great game.

33:31.384 --> 33:33.219
-We had her.
-Well, whatever.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.180
When will we meet the baby?

33:36.264 --> 33:38.474
That's what we came for, 
not for you to win.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.143
-Oh, yeah.
-Please.

33:40.226 --> 33:41.769
-Yes.
-I'll go get her.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.979
Yes.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.064
-So exciting!
-So exciting, huh?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.442
-Want some peanuts?
-Yes.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.484
Oh, sure…

33:50.695 --> 33:51.571
Mariana?

33:52.613 --> 33:54.073
Help me with Regina.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.284
What, am I playing nanny again?

33:56.909 --> 33:58.911
Don't ask, just come.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.084
Come on.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.171
Let's go.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.050
-Look, girls, meet Valentina.
-Oh, wow!

34:12.133 --> 34:13.092
Look!

34:13.176 --> 34:15.178
She has your eyes, friend.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.804
-Really?
-The same eyes.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.224
And this is Mariana, her other mother.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.435
And Regina, my other daughter.

34:23.102 --> 34:24.604
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-What?

34:24.687 --> 34:26.647
Her other mother? I don't get it.

34:26.731 --> 34:30.151
It's not hard.
We're both the mothers of both the girls.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.152
Right?

34:31.652 --> 34:33.071
Okay…

34:33.613 --> 34:34.447
Yeah.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.991
Well, they're both gorgeous.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.201
Divine.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.161
Yes, baby girl.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.538
I knew she was a lesbian.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.124
-Oh, friend.
-I knew since high school.

34:46.876 --> 34:50.588
Your friends must be having a blast
gossiping about what happened.

34:50.671 --> 34:51.631
Oh, I don't care.

34:51.714 --> 34:52.840
Let them talk.

34:55.218 --> 34:57.011
I'm very proud of you, honey.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.682
There's a lot I need to change,
but for my own sake,

35:03.017 --> 35:04.685
not for other people's sake.

35:06.104 --> 35:09.065
And there's a lot
we have to change about our relationship.

35:11.192 --> 35:14.278
That's why going to therapy
isn't such a bad idea.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.116
Thank you.

35:33.131 --> 35:38.594
SCIENCE BUILDING

35:51.816 --> 35:52.942
Hello, Dad.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.902
Mariana, what are you doing here?

35:55.903 --> 35:57.905
I want to heal our relationship.

35:58.531 --> 35:59.574
Right now?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.316
