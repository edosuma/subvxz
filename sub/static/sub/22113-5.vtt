00:00.209 --> 00:02.644
Previously on The Last Man On Earth...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.303
Living apart will destroy this group.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.105
Todd, wake up! I don't
know what's wrong!

00:07.207 --> 00:09.943
I think Todd had a heart attack!

00:09.969 --> 00:11.701
I'm glad you're still here, bud.

00:11.726 --> 00:13.932
Clearly, we're much worse apart.

00:13.957 --> 00:15.613
But if we're all gonna live together,

00:15.715 --> 00:18.557
it's definitely not gonna
be in this crap-hole.

01:36.639 --> 01:39.540
This place has great energy.

01:40.789 --> 01:42.566
- I think we're home.
- Mm.

01:42.664 --> 01:44.536
Oh.

01:45.012 --> 01:46.978
She looks nice.

01:53.911 --> 01:55.156
Oh, here, honey, let me get that.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.481
No, don't you dare.

01:56.952 --> 01:58.218
You just had a heart attack.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.543
Now, come on, hon. We don't
know it was a heart attack.

02:00.645 --> 02:02.645
You were yelling "heart
attack" while it was happening.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.147
You're overreacting, hon.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.882
I promise you, I am fine.

02:05.907 --> 02:08.061
I'm glad you have
this positive attitude,

02:08.086 --> 02:09.651
but we can't take this lightly.

02:09.753 --> 02:11.301
There are gonna have to be
a lot of changes around here.

02:11.326 --> 02:14.734
No, okay, and that's fine, but
I can get my own bag, you know?

02:14.759 --> 02:16.693
Todd.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.762
Fine.

02:19.865 --> 02:21.364
Be my guest.

02:26.838 --> 02:30.306
Oh, my God, Dawn, we
get it, you're a baby!

02:30.408 --> 02:32.675
Stop being such a stereotype.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.444
Maybe you should just leave her outside.

02:34.546 --> 02:36.880
Oh, I'm seriously
starting to consider it.

02:36.982 --> 02:40.783
Oh, Dawn, I feel bad
even joking like that.

02:40.886 --> 02:43.119
But seriously, Dawn,
shut your boob-hole.

02:43.221 --> 02:45.688
Amen to that.

02:46.703 --> 02:48.424
A rival cartel,

02:48.901 --> 02:52.295
on my property, in my home,

02:53.182 --> 02:55.632
just strolls through my gates.

02:56.611 --> 02:59.235
It appears we have a snake in our midst.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.305
No, Abuela, there-there is no snake.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.511
Then it is your incompetence?

03:06.536 --> 03:08.645
No-no, it was not my
fault. Uh, they disabled...

03:08.747 --> 03:12.649
Prove to me that you
are not incompetent.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.286
Ten seconds.

03:18.423 --> 03:19.722
Uh...

03:41.655 --> 03:43.147
Close.

03:43.212 --> 03:46.646
Just four moves away.

03:46.952 --> 03:48.618
Clean this up.

03:54.324 --> 03:56.793
We have to do something soon.

03:56.895 --> 03:58.561
Or we could be next.

04:05.303 --> 04:07.203
Okay, grab some bubbles

04:07.305 --> 04:10.173
and just wrap anything
that looks dangerous.

04:10.275 --> 04:14.837
I'm talking choke-ables,
flammables, decapitate-ables.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.279
Ooh! What do we have here?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.015
- A little Rubik's Cube.
- Oh.

04:19.117 --> 04:20.483
A little Ruby Booby.

04:20.507 --> 04:22.151
Used to be pretty good at these, huh?

04:22.253 --> 04:23.686
Ooh, and look at that.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.221
A little Mexican flare.

04:25.323 --> 04:26.913
They love their skulls down here.

04:26.938 --> 04:28.391
Tandy, put that down, okay?

04:28.416 --> 04:30.560
This house isn't gonna
baby-proof itself.

04:30.662 --> 04:32.562
- Be right there.
- Tandy, this baby's due

04:32.664 --> 04:36.466
any day now, and this place is
a disaster waiting to happen.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.468
What about all that
talk about how this place

04:38.570 --> 04:39.804
had such great energy?

04:39.829 --> 04:41.471
Well, Shark Tanks have great energy,

04:41.496 --> 04:43.506
but that doesn't mean I'm
gonna walk into that room

04:43.608 --> 04:45.375
without a great business plan.

04:45.938 --> 04:47.176
Okay, lost me there.

04:47.201 --> 04:49.178
Shark Tanks... The TV
show, not the thing.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.349
Look, the point is, when you're
a little baby with a soft skull

04:53.451 --> 04:56.919
and poor depth perception,
every house is a death trap.

04:57.022 --> 04:59.889
But this one won't be, not
when we're through with it.

05:00.311 --> 05:01.233
All right.

05:01.258 --> 05:03.493
Now, will you be a dear
and bubble wrap that for me?

05:05.295 --> 05:06.934
- This?
- Yeah.

05:06.959 --> 05:08.831
- This thing right here?
- Uh-huh.

05:09.413 --> 05:11.968
This appears to be a tube of bubble wrap

05:12.070 --> 05:14.170
already bubble wrapped with bubble wrap.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.074
And you would like me
to bubble wrap it again?

05:17.871 --> 05:20.682
There's a fork in there.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.772
Is it done?

05:42.600 --> 05:43.897
Where did you place it?

05:43.922 --> 05:45.756
Is that my piñata?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.848
Sí, Abuela.

05:48.873 --> 05:50.673
Tie it up.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.411
Ay, que averguenza.

05:55.513 --> 05:57.647
Just give up now.

06:03.340 --> 06:04.481
Where you been, Hector?

06:04.506 --> 06:05.705
It is your birthday.

06:05.730 --> 06:08.264
I wanted your piñata to be just right.

06:10.261 --> 06:11.407
No, no.

06:12.597 --> 06:16.299
I want Panchito to have the first swing.

06:17.018 --> 06:17.954
Oh, no, I couldn't.

06:17.979 --> 06:19.212
Course you can.

06:19.237 --> 06:22.276
You've been a loyal and trusted friend.

06:22.572 --> 06:24.619
But it is your birthday.

06:24.674 --> 06:28.610
And when it is your birthday,
I will take the first swing.

06:33.918 --> 06:35.885
Por supuesto, jefe.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.971
You can do better than that.

06:55.306 --> 06:57.006
There.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.488
It's right in front of you.

07:08.163 --> 07:10.029
Federales!

07:10.054 --> 07:11.154
Vámonos, muchachos!

07:11.256 --> 07:12.232
Pronto, vámonos!

07:37.916 --> 07:39.849
Alto!

07:47.801 --> 07:50.802
Well, these stairs
are an obvious hazard,

07:50.837 --> 07:53.404
but nothing a couple
packing peanuts can't fix.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.140
Packing peanuts?

07:55.175 --> 07:57.545
Yeah, packing peanuts.

07:57.570 --> 07:59.777
You don't want our
baby getting SIFILISS.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.591
Syphilis?

08:01.616 --> 08:02.856
SIFILISS.

08:02.881 --> 08:04.582
- Syphilis?
- SIFILISS.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.351
You know, Sudden Infant Falling

08:06.386 --> 08:08.453
Into Large Indoor Spaces Syndrome?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.388
Oh, I thought you meant the other one.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.892
No, I'm talking about the bad one.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.971
Hello, Todd. New wheels?

08:27.996 --> 08:30.875
Yup. Melissa wants me to
stay off my feet, so...

08:30.911 --> 08:32.277
Todd.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.212
Where's your helmet?

08:34.246 --> 08:36.047
I got it.

08:36.403 --> 08:38.049
Can you put it on, please?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.385
You know, I just really don't think

08:40.419 --> 08:42.820
I need a helmet, hon.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.790
Todd, you have another
heart episode, you pass out,

08:45.825 --> 08:47.325
you fall out of your
chair, you hit the floor,

08:47.360 --> 08:48.359
boom, you're dead.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.161
Okay, put it on.

08:58.086 --> 09:01.072
Ooh, Speed Racer over there.

09:01.107 --> 09:02.907
See? It's cute.

09:04.188 --> 09:05.647
Well, this has been fun.

09:05.672 --> 09:06.844
Take it easy, Knievel.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.320
Let me know if you jump any buses later.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.653
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.076
- What?
- That's not for you.

09:18.185 --> 09:19.691
That's for us, okay.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.059
This is for you.

09:22.466 --> 09:25.196
Try this. You're gonna love it.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.067
Great. If I were a starfish,
I'd be in friggin' heaven.

09:34.684 --> 09:36.274
Hey, mister.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.042
Strap up, please.

09:39.566 --> 09:41.003
I want to hear it click.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.011
Did you hear it?

09:46.036 --> 09:47.702
Ridiculous.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.925
God. Oh, my God.

09:54.383 --> 09:56.561
Is she still fussing?

09:56.596 --> 09:57.821
No. She's super calm, Gail.

09:57.846 --> 09:58.852
She's loving life.

09:58.877 --> 10:00.602
Friggin' Mary Poppins over here.

10:00.627 --> 10:02.888
Okay, blow it out your butt.

10:02.913 --> 10:05.236
- I'm on your team here.
- I'm sorry, I just...

10:05.272 --> 10:07.109
Ugh. I don't know what to do.

10:07.134 --> 10:10.642
Okay, well, lucky for you,
this ain't my first rodeo.

10:10.984 --> 10:13.278
Have you tried whiskey on her lips?

10:13.787 --> 10:14.579
No.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.580
- Scotch?
- No.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.148
- Wine?
- No.

10:17.183 --> 10:18.904
Vodka? Schnapps?

10:18.929 --> 10:20.718
A teeny bit of Listerine?

10:20.754 --> 10:23.412
I'm not gonna roofie my baby, Gail.

10:23.437 --> 10:26.838
Hey, why don't we try
driving her a little bit?

10:26.863 --> 10:29.543
Sometimes the motion of
the car calms them down.

10:30.066 --> 10:31.729
All right, sure. Let's give it a shot.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.024
No, you can't give a baby a shot.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.483
I'm telling you, just
the teeniest little...

10:35.518 --> 10:38.085
Okay, I got you. I got you
on... I see what you were saying.

10:38.121 --> 10:39.253
- You got it?
- Yup, yup.

10:39.288 --> 10:40.842
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.381
- 'Cause I thought you were
talking about shots. - No.

10:50.038 --> 10:53.318
Aah! I'm a baby and I'm falling!

11:11.035 --> 11:12.786
All right, think we're good here.

11:12.822 --> 11:15.589
Looks like our baby won't be
getting SIFILISS, after all.

11:15.625 --> 11:18.226
He or she is much more
likely to get HERPESS.

11:18.266 --> 11:19.225
Herpes?

11:19.250 --> 11:22.752
High Elevation Rugrat Positively
Evades Staircase Syndrome.

11:22.777 --> 11:25.166
Oh, that's music to my ears.

11:25.201 --> 11:27.094
Good. Now if you'll excuse me,

11:27.119 --> 11:28.595
I'm gonna take a little breakaroonie.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.571
No, no. There's so much left to do!

11:30.606 --> 11:34.046
You're telling me. I mean, this
cube isn't gonna rube itself.

11:34.071 --> 11:36.718
Okay. You can play your game,

11:36.743 --> 11:38.846
- but on one condition.
- What's that?

11:38.881 --> 11:40.848
You be the one to tell our child

11:40.883 --> 11:43.679
that the reason they only have one eye

11:43.704 --> 11:46.654
is because their father
chose to play a game

11:46.689 --> 11:48.022
instead of covering

11:48.057 --> 11:50.594
all the exposed cactus
needles with corks.

11:50.619 --> 11:53.019
- Carol...
- Agree to the condition!

11:56.484 --> 11:57.755
Where are you going?

11:57.780 --> 11:59.934
To cork the cacti!

12:00.473 --> 12:02.122
Tandy.

12:03.512 --> 12:05.172
Puzzle rhombus.

12:12.510 --> 12:13.809
God!

12:44.180 --> 12:45.846
I just don't get it.

12:45.882 --> 12:48.282
This baby has run from
a nuclear holocaust,

12:48.318 --> 12:51.185
been stranded on a deserted
island, lost at sea,

12:51.220 --> 12:52.486
and witnessed two murders,

12:52.522 --> 12:55.356
one decapitation and a
headless body riding a Jet Ski.

12:55.391 --> 12:58.626
Now we're settled in a beautiful
house and she's going nuts.

12:58.661 --> 13:00.361
It just doesn't make any sense.

13:00.396 --> 13:02.156
Maybe the house is haunted.

13:02.181 --> 13:04.699
Come on, Gail. You don't
seriously believe in ghosts.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.755
I do believe there is another dimension.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.686
Okay, you're crazy.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.888
Oh, okay, well, tell me, professor,

13:10.924 --> 13:13.091
- how did the world start?
- The Big Bang.

13:13.116 --> 13:15.927
Uh-huh, and then, what are the
physics behind that? I forget.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.163
- Well, the physics of that are
you being a jerk right now. - Oh.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.432
- Well, I'll have you know that you're...
- Gail, watch out!

13:27.205 --> 13:30.656
Oh, she stopped crying.
She must be traumatized.

13:30.681 --> 13:31.797
Hey, listen.

13:31.822 --> 13:35.012
♪ Kookaburra sits
in the old gum tree ♪

13:35.048 --> 13:37.782
♪ Merry, merry king of... ♪

13:38.049 --> 13:40.518
There she goes again.

13:42.760 --> 13:45.460
Hey. I'm gonna try something here.

13:45.766 --> 13:47.625
Gail, what are you doing?

13:47.970 --> 13:49.193
Slow down!

13:49.229 --> 13:51.329
Gail! Aah!

13:58.524 --> 14:00.357
Just as I suspected.

14:00.764 --> 14:03.799
Looks like we got an adrenaline
junkie baby on our hands.

14:20.141 --> 14:21.665
What are you doing?

14:21.899 --> 14:23.484
So, what, I can't pop and lock now?

14:23.509 --> 14:26.132
It's too much, you're
gonna overload your system!

14:26.157 --> 14:27.925
No, Melissa, this is my outlet

14:27.950 --> 14:30.150
so that I don't overload my system!

14:30.186 --> 14:31.763
Then you need to find a new outlet!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.387
Okay, you know what, I've
had just about enough of this.

14:33.412 --> 14:35.733
Todd, you're stressing your
heart... just calm down.

14:35.758 --> 14:38.036
No! You know what, I am done being calm.

14:38.061 --> 14:40.932
And I am done with this wheelchair.

14:40.957 --> 14:43.819
And I'm done with this stupid helmet.

14:43.960 --> 14:45.810
- Unstrapping!
- Todd,

14:45.835 --> 14:47.750
don't you dare take that helmet off.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.036
Todd...

14:49.228 --> 14:53.130
Look, I am not a
child, okay? I am a man!

14:53.211 --> 14:55.055
And I cannot live like this!

14:55.080 --> 14:58.020
Look, I am sorry that
I am trying to help you.

14:58.045 --> 14:59.879
But finding you in
that grocery store was

14:59.904 --> 15:01.449
the worst moment of my life.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.582
And I am so scared to lose you.

15:03.607 --> 15:05.753
But if you don't care, then
fine, take off your helmet.

15:05.788 --> 15:07.154
Eat all the junk food you want.

15:07.190 --> 15:10.248
But I am not gonna sit here
and watch you kill yourself.

15:25.797 --> 15:30.199
Oh, bud, bud, bud.
You got this all wrong.

15:30.223 --> 15:32.323
Let me show you the
magic of the piñata.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.953
Here, hand me that
poker-I-hardly-knew-her.

15:35.305 --> 15:36.294
Thank you.

15:36.329 --> 15:39.030
Okay, now, this thing
is a friggin' candy bomb.

15:39.066 --> 15:41.866
And the object is to
knock the crap out of it

15:41.902 --> 15:43.501
to get to the candy center.

15:43.537 --> 15:46.404
It's the same basic technology
behind the Tootsie Pop.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.829
So, what you do is
you blindfold yourself,

15:49.854 --> 15:52.834
and then you do a couple spinsies, huh.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.245
Like this.

15:54.897 --> 15:57.631
Okay, let's dance.

15:59.451 --> 16:01.270
Okay, that was not...

16:04.391 --> 16:06.324
That is not piñata.

16:07.824 --> 16:10.721
Okay, now, normally
I wouldn't peek, okay.

16:10.746 --> 16:14.165
Because that's cheating. Oh... oh, okay.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.150
- But since this is more of a tutorial...
- Tandy!

16:17.175 --> 16:19.204
Tell me you did not
just spray glass shards

16:19.239 --> 16:21.282
all over the ground.

16:21.307 --> 16:25.140
I'm baby-proofing, and
you are doing the reverse!

16:25.165 --> 16:28.352
You're... foorpybab-ing!

16:28.377 --> 16:30.810
I am not, Carol, and
I take offense at that!

16:30.865 --> 16:34.270
Okay, if anything, I'm doing
the reverse of foorpybab-ing...

16:34.295 --> 16:37.856
I'm, uh... babbyproffing.

16:37.881 --> 16:40.434
Don't worry, I'll do it myself.

16:40.459 --> 16:43.082
Look, but you... there's
nothing left to do.

16:43.107 --> 16:45.470
We have to be ready for everything!

16:45.495 --> 16:47.447
We don't know what's
gonna happen in the future.

16:47.472 --> 16:49.962
So some things we're just
gonna have to take as they come.

16:49.987 --> 16:52.928
But I'm sure that in the moment
we'll come up with a solution.

16:52.953 --> 16:54.353
We always do.

16:54.378 --> 16:55.988
- Do we?
- Here, I'll show you.

16:56.024 --> 16:57.390
Oh, quick, there's a tsunami!

16:57.425 --> 16:59.992
What do we do? Easy,
get to higher ground.

17:00.028 --> 17:01.913
Oh, good God, a hurricane!

17:01.938 --> 17:03.327
Sandbag moat.

17:03.352 --> 17:06.866
Oh, no, a hail storm the
size of doughnut holes!

17:06.891 --> 17:07.999
Cotton-lined football helmet.

17:08.023 --> 17:09.976
- Tandy...
- Carol, my point is

17:10.001 --> 17:12.005
we can handle anything
that comes our way.

17:12.030 --> 17:14.452
That is not true, and you know it.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.887
Okay, flash floods. Paper towel truck.

17:16.913 --> 17:20.579
Sinkhole, pogo stick. Alien
abduction, heavy shoes.

17:20.647 --> 17:23.049
Those aren't the things
about which I'm worried!

17:23.084 --> 17:25.117
Then what the hell
are you worried about?

17:25.185 --> 17:27.819
The virus, Tandy!

17:29.199 --> 17:30.988
The virus.

17:33.973 --> 17:37.096
What are we gonna do if
our baby gets the virus?

17:40.431 --> 17:41.467
I don't know.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.604
But if that happens,

17:46.267 --> 17:47.892
none of this matters.

17:49.244 --> 17:50.186
I know.

17:50.968 --> 17:53.535
So, wh-why are you doing it?

17:54.905 --> 17:56.958
Because it's the only thing I can do.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.322
Won't be long.

18:12.393 --> 18:14.458
You're scared.

18:14.932 --> 18:16.227
Yes.

18:17.563 --> 18:19.797
There's an old story

18:19.866 --> 18:22.933
about a Chinese farmer who buys a horse.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.237
A short while later,
the horse runs away.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.407
His neighbor says,
"Oh, that's bad news."

18:29.509 --> 18:31.375
The farmer responds,

18:31.444 --> 18:33.944
"Good news, bad news, who can say?"

18:34.906 --> 18:36.814
Three days later, the horse returns,

18:36.883 --> 18:39.517
and with it, a herd of wild horses.

18:41.812 --> 18:44.188
His neighbor, seeing his good
fortune, congratulates him

18:44.257 --> 18:46.123
on the good news.

18:46.159 --> 18:51.295
The farmer responds, "Good
news, bad news, who can say?"

18:51.330 --> 18:54.198
The farmer gifts one of
the horses to his son.

18:54.267 --> 18:58.232
His son rides it, only to
be thrown from its back,

18:58.257 --> 19:00.204
badly breaking his leg.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.581
"That's bad news," says the neighbor.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.242
The farmer replies,

19:05.311 --> 19:08.946
"Good news, bad news, who can say?"

19:09.015 --> 19:13.386
Days later, the emperor summons
every able-bodied young man

19:13.417 --> 19:15.086
to fight in the war.

19:15.854 --> 19:18.409
The farmer's son is spared.

19:19.362 --> 19:21.292
What good news.

19:21.511 --> 19:27.039
Good news, bad news, who can say?

19:27.064 --> 19:30.011
It all depends where the story ends.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.704
And that is the only thing
in life we can predict.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.273
The only thing we truly know.

19:36.671 --> 19:40.079
Everybody's story ends the same way.

19:43.553 --> 19:44.852
Death.

19:52.813 --> 19:54.792
You thought my story
was going to end today.

19:55.564 --> 19:57.597
Good news, you might say.

19:58.109 --> 20:01.332
But is there bad news around the corner?

20:06.729 --> 20:08.405
Who can say?

20:11.565 --> 20:14.666
No, Pancho. What are you doing?

20:17.828 --> 20:21.507
It was you? You are the snake?

20:21.900 --> 20:23.400
I thought you knew.

20:24.268 --> 20:26.342
You were going to let
me hit the piñata.

20:26.367 --> 20:28.659
The bomb is not in the piñata.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.361
Then where is it?

20:31.350 --> 20:32.920
Who can say?

20:55.981 --> 21:00.981
