You can have it.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
-Thank you. -I did you a solid.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Can you do me a solid, if you mind?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Sure.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
I'm just shopping around,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
and I'm dating the ex-girlfriend of the security guard here...

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
-Okay. -...and he doesn't have, like,

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
the best sense of humor about it,

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
so I'm just trying to get in and out as quick as I can.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
So, if you see him -- I'm gonna go quick --

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
could you just yell out to me, give me a head's up?

-What am I yelling? -[ Gasps ]

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
What could you yell? Uh, yell...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
"Punch my bunch."

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I don't know. Something he'll only know --

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
he'll know we're only talking about,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
like "Punch my bunch."

He'll know what I'm talking about.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
"Punch my bunch," if you see him.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Thank you. I'm gonna be quick, anyway.

-Joey just did it! -Hey, Joe! Joe!

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
He got away.

-I -- I can't -- -You know what?

Today, we're at the mall at Bay Plaza

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
talking to strangers and, long story short,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
we're gonna be fed a bizarre scenario from the other guys.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Long story short, after we get the scenario,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
we have to explain why we did it.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah, long story short,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
you have to get this person to say they understand

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
why you did what you did.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Short story very long,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
if they don't agree with you, you lose.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, hey, excuse me.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
There's a Victoria's Secrets in this mall?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Awesome. My girl's birthday's coming up,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
so I don't want to get in trouble, you know what I mean?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
She's already mad at me. -"Long story short..."

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
"...I planted a dead possum in my wife's backseat

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
to prove a point."

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
...I, uh... [ Laughter ]

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
...I planted a dead possum in my wife's backseat

10:21.000 --> 10:25.000
just to prove a point.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
I could that you're confused. Let me tell you the story.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I, uh... All right.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
We got this nice tree in the backyard, right?

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And she was always like, "Oh, cut down the tree.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
It's gonna fall on the house. Cut down the tree."

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I'm like, "Honey, there's a bunch of possums

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
living in the tree. You can't cut down the tree.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
You're gonna kill the possums."

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
She's like, "That's not true. Possums just move out."

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
So, what I did was...

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
[ Laughing ] "I strangled the possums."

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
...I strangled the possum and I put it

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
in the backseat of her car.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
It's kind of like, you know, like a "Godfather"-type,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
you know, thing, like, "Hey, is this what you want?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Dead possums?" -"Here's where it went wrong."

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
-And here's where it went wrong. -"It was just playing dead.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It woke up and attacked her while she was driving."

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
You got it so far?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
But here's where it went sideways --

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
possums play dead.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
It wasn't really dead.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
It woke up while she was driving

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
and started running around the car,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
hissing at her, biting her, and stuff like that.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
She ended up crashing the car into the tree,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
knocked the tree over.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
So, at the end of the day, I lost anyway.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Do you know if there's any good sneaker stores?

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Just the Footaction over there.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Because I'm not from around here.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
I was visiting someone. Long story short --

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
"I complimented a widow on her figure."

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
...I complimented, like, a widow on her figure,

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
and it didn't go well for me.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I mean, I understand that she's a widow,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
that her, you know -- her husband passed away.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
"That morning."

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
Granted, he passed away this morning.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
So, I've known her for 20-plus years.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
And I was just trying to comfort her.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
"I've been admiring that figure for a long time."

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Just bad timing.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
It's bad timing, 'cause I have been admiring that figure

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
for quite a long time.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
I mean, we're talking 20 years.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
But I had to wait for the right time to be respectful.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I thought I was being respectful because he finally passed away

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
peacefully in his sleep this morning.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
"He fell asleep at the wheel."

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
but they said upon impact,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
that he did not feel any pain or whatever.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Rest in peace, Charlie. Rest in peace.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
You get my point. I had to -- like, it wasn't --

I almost had a heart attack there.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
I was walking around, couldn't decide on anything, you know?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Finally went with the pizza.

I haven't shopped here before. -Never?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
She's scared of every little thing,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
so I want her to get a little bit stronger

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
and a little bit more -- you know, conquer her fears.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You know, her mother's big and strong.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Right. [ Laughter ]

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
You know, so I want her to be like her mom.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
You know, you ever hear of sleep training?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Right.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
So, I was like, "What better time to instill fear in her

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
than when she's sleeping?"

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
What I'm trying to do is really amp up

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
the traumatization of it --

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
you know, these little nightmare tactics.

-Come on! -Come on!

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Hey, Bess, it's Joey.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
I just made a bad joke on the set,

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
where I called you big, fat, and strong.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I instantly regretted it, but it's on tape,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
and I don't want it to come back and bite me, so I'm apologizing.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
I love you. You're beautiful.

Ah! It's finally getting warm.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Nice ice-breaker, Murr. Let's talk weather.

He's processing.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
[ Laughter ]

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
She didn't want him to know she was out of town,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
so I was like, "You know what? I see your point.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
You're always taking care of your husband."

"Let  me take care of your husband."

I had her normal clothes on, her wig.

"The good news is, she was very specific."

that they only make love once a week,

and she was only gone for two weeks.

NARRATOR: The long and short of it is

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
that Q is tonight's big loser.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Hey! Q has lost, so today, buddy,

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
you are working at a health conference

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
thrown by our friends at Welnys.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Sal: This is what you're gonna have to do, okay?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
You're gonna be signing up attendees for a raffle...

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Mm-hmm.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
...and as you meet them, you have to find people

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
whose first names begin with all the five vowels.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah. If their first name begins with a vowel, good news.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
It's checked off the list. You can move on.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
But if their name starts with anything

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
other than a vowel, bad news is

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
you have to say whatever we tell you directly to their face.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
Now, the punishment ends, buddy, when you find all five vowels.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Simple. Simple?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
[ Laughing ] Yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
There's a lot of "U"s floating around out there

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
that I get to work with? All right.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Murr: Our friends at Welnys provide corporate

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000

Joe: There he is, the official raffle-checker, Brian Quinn.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Murr: Oh, wow.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Q, you got a fair amount of people here.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Since we're dealing with vowels and consonants,

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
we wanted to bring Vanna White, but she wasn't available.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So, we brought in Shae. -Shae's our Vanna White.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Vanna Black.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
-All right. Vanna Black. -All right, Vanna Black it is.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Murr: So, now you're trying to pick vowels.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Who looks like a vowel? -Ugh.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Sal: So, here's what's going on here --

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
Q has a clipboard with every single attendee's name on it,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
and next to it, we've randomly generated a line.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Some might be an insult.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
Some might be something hard for Q to say.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
The point is is that it's pre-determined

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
based on absolutely nothing.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Completely random.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Hi, sir, did you sign in for the raffle yet?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000

You set a nice tone for yourself...

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Yes.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
...getting an "A" on the first try.

Excuse me. Did you sign up for the raffle yet?

-Jonathan. -Jonathan.

Murr: Flip the page and read the line next to his name.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
All right, do I have you in?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh! Where's that streak now, bitch?

What? Yeah, yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
No, no.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
I'm just curious because normally I see the phones,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
and then I saw that your...

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, good luck with the raffle. You're all signed up.

-Wow. That was tough, Q. -That was a good one.

Hi. Do you know if you're signed up for the raffle --

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000

-What is your name? -Ursula.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
-Oh, my God! -Oh, my God! What?!

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
There's no way your name's Ursula.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
-It is. -Oh, my God!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Can I get a hug? Can I get a hug?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This is imploding on us right now.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
-All right, give him a "U." -This is insanity.

0.02%.

-Wow. -Excuse me.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Sorry. By any chance, do you know if your name's in

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
