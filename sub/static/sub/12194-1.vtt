02:43.587 --> 02:46.338
DORNY: HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS BEFORE?

02:52.882 --> 02:55.847
We received some very
unusual data today.

02:55.872 --> 02:59.426
- Military division?
- Harbinger 1 training facility.

02:59.451 --> 03:02.170
- Which model?
- S.A.R.

03:02.195 --> 03:06.332
There's been a reprogram count,
one and a half million just under one day.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.816
That is a high number.

03:07.841 --> 03:09.776
It's unprecedented.

03:09.801 --> 03:12.390
Well, in that case, Mills.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.473
Congratulations.

03:37.413 --> 03:39.509
Drifter.
Report.

03:39.534 --> 03:41.660
The other are out on the strip.

03:42.324 --> 03:44.237
And it's shitty.

03:45.697 --> 03:47.423
See you out there.

04:08.617 --> 04:11.152
Hey.
Winder.

04:11.423 --> 04:13.811
- What's this all about?
- I'm not the guy you should be asking.

04:13.836 --> 04:16.531
We've been on training
the last 4 times out.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.173
It's 2 days.

04:18.197 --> 04:20.595
They're looking for marines
with combat time.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.201
Not many of those left.

04:22.226 --> 04:23.891
I thought we were pushing
to finish it.

04:23.916 --> 04:26.024
With drones.
With more than enough men sitting it out...

04:26.049 --> 04:29.274
You know no one is sitting it out
over there because we are all here.

04:29.732 --> 04:31.642
Harbinger right?

04:31.704 --> 04:33.817
If it were me,
I take a look around,

04:33.842 --> 04:35.807
think about the money,
not where it's coming from...

04:35.832 --> 04:38.005
and get on the transport.

04:40.743 --> 04:42.187
Wait.

04:43.114 --> 04:45.134
You've been assigned a Tech.

04:52.864 --> 04:55.906
Captain Bukes.
Katherine Mills.

04:55.931 --> 04:57.049
What do you want?

04:57.074 --> 04:59.115
We have hardware in the field
we'll be testing.

04:59.139 --> 05:01.978
- I'm from Harbinger, I'll be observing.
- Oh yeah?

05:02.004 --> 05:05.369
- Keeping an eye on us.
- Yes, and the hardware.

05:05.566 --> 05:08.185
Are you trying to work out
what you can save on?

05:08.210 --> 05:09.619
No, no.
That's no what we do.

05:09.650 --> 05:12.476
We're venders for the US military.
We're not the US military.

05:12.501 --> 05:15.211
If you don't keep up, we'll leave
you where you pass out.

05:15.236 --> 05:17.330
And turn that shit off.

05:17.342 --> 05:20.118
I don't want to be scanned
at anytime, is that clear?

05:20.143 --> 05:22.434
This doesn't go off.

05:25.215 --> 05:27.367
- Captain?
- We're Oscar Mike, Mills.

05:27.406 --> 05:29.687
Fall in or stay here.

05:30.105 --> 05:31.787
Is she with us?

05:32.392 --> 05:33.594
Looks that way.

05:33.619 --> 05:35.766
How long do you think till
we see one of them in uniform?

05:35.791 --> 05:38.078
By then we won't be.

05:38.103 --> 05:41.647
Here.
See if you can understand it.

How the fuck did she
even know my name?

06:14.784 --> 06:16.597
Did you just look me up?

06:16.976 --> 06:19.001

08:00.285 --> 08:02.829
Jeez, boy.
What is it? Hm?

08:02.854 --> 08:04.890
You need to take a shit of something.

08:04.915 --> 08:07.196
Give me 5 seconds
with this motherfucker.

08:07.221 --> 08:10.150
This is an exercise.
We don't know where we're going.

08:10.285 --> 08:12.087
Even my wife doesn't know
where we're going.

08:12.112 --> 08:14.398
I thought Cutbill was your wife.

08:14.810 --> 08:16.217
You like that.

08:16.242 --> 08:19.432
I do love my mute little war prince.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.101
Yes, ma'am.
It means a lot.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.227
You do know your name
is on your front.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.441
Don't you, Goodwin?

08:53.761 --> 08:55.562
But it don't say the first name.

09:05.255 --> 09:06.782
Medical records indicated...

09:06.811 --> 09:08.889
Would you like me to stop
the children from bothering you, Mills?

09:08.914 --> 09:12.844
Watch it, Sarge.
You got to choose your friends carefully.

09:12.869 --> 09:16.625
This one might be able to find out
how much porn you are downloading.

09:17.746 --> 09:21.489
It would take more than one person
to calculate that shit, let me tell you.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.397
It's "CONCLUDED".

09:31.125 --> 09:32.736
Thank you.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.039

move on these coordinates.

Live ammo.

What she's got,
is another tool.

11:03.466 --> 11:05.145
Like these.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.484
Do those go into your brain?

11:57.512 --> 12:00.050
Goodwin.
Get that stuff out of the way.

12:00.075 --> 12:01.693
Yes, sir.

12:07.162 --> 12:10.873
- Captain Bukes.
- Wait a moment, please.

Who's monitoring us?

13:10.210 --> 13:13.769
- There's no one here.
- I'm watching you.

13:15.149 --> 13:17.455
You better bet there's no body here.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.159
Sir.
What do you want us to do?

13:25.184 --> 13:27.095
Let's get on with it.
We're Oscar Mike.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.740
- Sir!
- Yes, sir.

13:28.765 --> 13:31.810
- Captain, do you have ground support?
- No.

13:31.835 --> 13:34.304
No unmanned ground recon
what so ever?

13:34.329 --> 13:35.711
Problem?

13:35.736 --> 13:37.813
- No, no. I just thought...
- Good.

13:37.838 --> 13:40.941
I'm sorry, Captain, I think
we got off on the wrong foot.

13:40.966 --> 13:43.222
I don't think so, Mills.

14:05.474 --> 14:07.244
2 days.

14:09.465 --> 14:11.802
This place got a serious
decorating problem.

14:11.827 --> 14:13.605
Home sweet home.

14:13.630 --> 14:16.100
- Yo, Hackett.
- Yeah?

14:16.125 --> 14:18.174
You decorated this place, right?

14:18.199 --> 14:21.613
I took inspiration from
your apartment, dipshit.

14:21.638 --> 14:26.087
- Is this whole thing going to be inside?
- Shut up and keep moving, Cherry.

14:49.961 --> 14:51.292
Alright.

14:51.317 --> 14:54.466
- Cutbill, eyes up.
- Yes, sir.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.044
We're here to train.

14:57.069 --> 14:59.685
But, that doesn't mean
we should let our guard down.

15:11.317 --> 15:12.891
Eyes up.

15:13.987 --> 15:16.594
Robinson, walk and point.

15:16.728 --> 15:18.540
Goodwin, with me.

15:19.767 --> 15:22.031
- Okay.
- Okay, spread out.

15:22.056 --> 15:24.466
No gaggle fuck, please, ladies.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.073

16:39.410 --> 16:41.640
We're all clear for about a click.

16:43.827 --> 16:46.159
Goodwin, hang in there for a second.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.356
Hackett, Loftus, Cutbill.

16:48.381 --> 16:51.089
Move wide,
check the flanks.

16:56.243 --> 16:57.743
Drifter?

16:58.092 --> 16:59.629
I got it.

17:09.452 --> 17:12.159
I understand that you
are a Supertech, Mills.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.383
You don't need to
do all this humping shit.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.792
Help me out,
with my boss.

17:20.035 --> 17:21.909
We're all a bunch of cavemen, huh?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.867
Not all of you, Sergeant.

17:23.867 --> 17:26.757
Good.
I like that.

17:27.217 --> 17:29.261
I got your six.

17:38.267 --> 17:39.692
Whoa.

17:44.702 --> 17:46.202
Mills?

17:49.452 --> 17:51.585
No, no, no, no.
Wait a minute.

17:56.734 --> 17:58.516
This is Drifter.

18:01.285 --> 18:03.590
We picked up some surveillance.

18:06.327 --> 18:08.035
Same here.

18:10.302 --> 18:12.552
Someone's got a new toy.

18:12.577 --> 18:15.677
- Harbinger make this?
- Yes.

18:15.702 --> 18:18.077
But, this one has been modified.

18:18.443 --> 18:20.862
It's Quantum robotics.
There's no operator.

18:20.887 --> 18:22.451
Quantum.

18:22.452 --> 18:25.358
One and naught and everything between.

18:25.383 --> 18:26.927
Yes, that's right.

18:26.952 --> 18:28.702
I read.

18:30.918 --> 18:33.699
It doesn't mean I understand
what I am reading.

18:36.426 --> 18:38.159
It's autonomous.

18:38.184 --> 18:42.351
All that power to get it to follow
Goodwin's dumbass through the forest.

18:43.603 --> 18:46.641
So, you high up in Harbinger?

18:46.666 --> 18:48.166
Yes

18:49.014 --> 18:50.959
Can I get a job?

18:51.162 --> 18:53.380
I just lost mine.

18:53.410 --> 18:54.910
I know.

18:56.785 --> 18:58.820
At least they know we're here.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.285
Let's keep moving.

19:09.493 --> 19:11.827
Mills, game time.

19:12.077 --> 19:13.577
Let's go!

19:33.493 --> 19:34.826
Take a look.

19:34.827 --> 19:36.493
What do we got this time?

19:36.493 --> 19:38.538
What does it look like?

19:45.246 --> 19:47.039
They look fucking ridiculous.

19:47.064 --> 19:50.076
Listen up.
9 robot targets to the north.

19:50.077 --> 19:53.617
- Close to the river, maybe more.
- Are you kidding me, man?

19:53.618 --> 19:56.488
Let's get this done, right?

19:56.868 --> 19:58.742
Goodwin, Hackett, with me.

19:58.743 --> 20:00.951
Everyone else, on the ridge.

20:00.952 --> 20:02.951
We're are gonna get some...

20:02.952 --> 20:05.242
Goodwin, you just stay with me.

20:05.243 --> 20:06.284
- Drifter.
- Yes, sir.

20:06.285 --> 20:08.586
Alright, everyone.
Switch on.

20:09.577 --> 20:11.077
Let's move.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.422
Mills?

20:16.024 --> 20:17.867
Care to join me?

20:58.535 --> 21:00.118
Ready.

21:01.077 --> 21:02.599
Ready.

21:04.714 --> 21:06.214
Set.

21:10.868 --> 21:13.535

The world is no place for you.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.260
There's no place for you
because they don't fit you.

25:45.285 --> 25:47.242
- Too damn big , Robinson.
- Too damn big , brother.

25:47.243 --> 25:49.493
Too damn big.

25:51.430 --> 25:53.013
So, I say where?

25:53.038 --> 25:54.968
"Where's the target?"

25:54.993 --> 25:57.242
He says, "Down there."

25:57.243 --> 25:58.743
" Goodwin. "

26:01.868 --> 26:05.618
I'm actually thinking,
"Should I smoke the little fucker."

26:07.118 --> 26:11.493
Oh, we don't want to shoot you, Cherry.
We love you.

26:11.702 --> 26:15.548
If you don't shave that ass hair off
your face, I might shoot you myself.

26:15.573 --> 26:17.302
Seriously, dude, get a razor.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.809
Is it true, you guys are really...

26:19.833 --> 26:24.422
- What? You think she's a fox?
- Damn, you little pervert.

26:24.447 --> 26:27.416
I think she's... interesting.

26:28.508 --> 26:31.342
- She's not even human, man.
- Alright.

26:31.993 --> 26:36.028
5 letters, "Most inferior".
Anybody?

26:36.606 --> 26:39.176
- Goodwin.
- That's not five.

26:39.177 --> 26:41.511
Yeah, but it is fucking true.

26:43.283 --> 26:45.740
Damn, did you see
those things up close?

26:45.765 --> 26:48.473
Honestly, they are rolling into each other.

26:48.498 --> 26:49.951
It's embarrassing, man.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.688
I have seen more advance juicers.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.407
Mills.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.200
Coffee?

27:14.953 --> 27:16.489
So.

27:16.764 --> 27:18.935
Where did you get to today?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.317
I had a look around.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.659
We still can't reach anyone.

27:28.660 --> 27:31.034
You had any luck?
You know, with your...

27:31.035 --> 27:32.742
The network here is local.

27:32.743 --> 27:34.992
There's something blocking our transmissions
but I don't know what.

27:34.993 --> 27:37.367
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of it.

27:37.368 --> 27:38.868
Right.

27:41.503 --> 27:44.227
Why doesn't Bukes ask me himself?

27:50.493 --> 27:53.248
Bukes, he's...

27:53.993 --> 27:55.659
He's a little shy.

27:55.660 --> 27:57.493
- Shy?
- Yeah.

27:57.493 --> 27:59.952
Especially around cute girls.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.577
Or maybe he just chooses
not to like you.

28:06.535 --> 28:09.518
With his record,
that's unfortunate for me.

28:10.410 --> 28:12.159
You pulled his file?

28:12.160 --> 28:14.741
Drifter, I pulled everyone's file.

28:15.077 --> 28:17.202
How many does it say?

28:18.452 --> 28:20.517
It says 18.

28:21.535 --> 28:24.771
Just the figures, no context, right?

28:27.206 --> 28:29.549
That's why he doesn't
want to like you.

28:30.827 --> 28:34.161
Those figures may be hard to swallow,
but that's the job.

28:35.594 --> 28:38.625
And we are good
at our jobs.

28:46.452 --> 28:49.202
So, how old were you
when you were chipped?

28:51.420 --> 28:53.351
I was 11.

28:54.014 --> 28:55.639
Without it?

28:56.240 --> 28:58.185
Paralysis.

28:59.077 --> 29:01.659
You have to wait until
you are old enough.

29:03.363 --> 29:05.579
Harbinger sponsored that?

29:06.071 --> 29:09.003
Yeah.
Cured it.

29:09.436 --> 29:12.102
I thought I was institutionalized.

29:14.441 --> 29:16.566
You have no idea.

29:19.285 --> 29:22.477
You can keep staring but
it won't make her disappear.

29:22.965 --> 29:25.391
Did she say anything to you?

29:25.743 --> 29:28.742
She says we're being blocked,
that's why there's no comms.

29:28.743 --> 29:30.785
She doesn't know why.

29:31.243 --> 29:32.909
She knows.

29:32.910 --> 29:34.492
I don't think so.

29:34.493 --> 29:37.247
Incredibly, she really seems
to be as clueless as us.

29:37.272 --> 29:40.147
All the gear.
No idea.

29:40.993 --> 29:43.077
Something's off.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.715
With the training?

29:46.160 --> 29:47.952
With Mills?

29:49.535 --> 29:50.676
Both.

29:50.703 --> 29:52.355
- Sir.
- Sir.

29:54.202 --> 29:56.284
What makes you so sure
that she's the problem?

29:56.285 --> 29:58.307
I have never been cut off before.

29:58.308 --> 30:01.468
Can't reach anyone at TAC.
Can't reach home at all.

30:01.493 --> 30:05.618
And there she is, with a radio
in her head saying nothing.

30:51.202 --> 30:52.986
What the hell do you want?

30:53.743 --> 30:55.327
Get out of here!

31:15.952 --> 31:18.159
- What the fuck is going on here?
- I don't know.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.992
- Was that your weapon?
- No.

31:20.017 --> 31:21.451
Who the fuck is firing, man?

31:21.452 --> 31:23.552
I don't know, man.
I just heard the firing.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.202
Loftus!

31:26.511 --> 31:29.399
Alright, Cutbill, fall back.
Goodwin, go with Loftus.

31:29.424 --> 31:32.579
Why do you keep asking me?
I told you, I don't know!

31:34.160 --> 31:35.242
What happened?

31:35.243 --> 31:37.630
Sir, I looked up and saw
Loftus stood right there,

31:37.655 --> 31:40.523
and the next second he was gone.

31:41.202 --> 31:44.035
Well, this is just
part of the training, right?

31:47.577 --> 31:51.091
- Loftus!
- Loftus!

31:54.824 --> 31:58.686
- Loftus!
- Loftus!

31:59.946 --> 32:02.083
Loftus!

32:32.660 --> 32:34.268
I see him.
Over there!

32:34.293 --> 32:36.618
Robinson, Hackett, follow me!

32:39.868 --> 32:41.423
Slow down, Cutbill!

32:41.448 --> 32:43.031
Slow down!

32:49.827 --> 32:51.452
Loftus?

33:04.493 --> 33:06.160
It's him.

33:08.702 --> 33:11.509
What is this?
Can you hear me, buddy?

33:11.534 --> 33:12.846
- Sam?
- Alright, move back.

33:12.871 --> 33:14.867
- Sergeant, what the hell is going on here?
- Sam.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.341
- What is going on here?
- Shut up! Cutbill!

33:17.366 --> 33:18.497
- Sam, talk to me.
- Enough!

33:18.522 --> 33:19.675
- Come on, man.
- You think that's going to help him?

33:19.700 --> 33:22.051
Look at me.
Shut up.

33:26.086 --> 33:28.010
- Should we take it off?
- Those lines, they're...

33:28.035 --> 33:29.367
Those cuts are straight.
It's like...

33:29.392 --> 33:31.656
- Captain, let's get out of here.
- Help me with him.

33:31.681 --> 33:33.696
- No, let's get out of here.
- Help me with him!

33:33.721 --> 33:36.179
Cutbill, shut up!

33:36.368 --> 33:38.159
Mills, what's going on?

33:38.160 --> 33:40.747
This is your target area from yesterday.

33:40.772 --> 33:42.272
What?

33:53.725 --> 33:55.942
Sir, we got to get him
out of here as soon...

33:57.389 --> 33:58.889
Move!

34:00.465 --> 34:02.092
MOVE!

34:21.827 --> 34:23.327
Mills.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.784
Those were our positions.

35:10.493 --> 35:12.486
Robinson, cover me!

35:22.910 --> 35:24.660
Keep moving!

35:28.743 --> 35:30.993
Captain, do you copy?
Over.

35:59.452 --> 36:01.992
We got to get somewhere
where we can get eyes on.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.455
I can't get a good shot from here.

36:50.743 --> 36:52.344
Captain?

36:52.369 --> 36:54.739
Captain, do you read me?
Copy.

36:55.910 --> 36:58.785
Anyone, this is Cutbill,
do you read me?

38:31.782 --> 38:33.967
Let me go.
Let me go.

38:36.202 --> 38:39.064
Let me go.
Let me go.

38:40.005 --> 38:41.409
Let me go.

38:41.630 --> 38:43.191
Let me go.

38:45.742 --> 38:47.291
Let me go.

39:01.547 --> 39:03.427
Please, don't!

39:03.452 --> 39:05.322
What the fuck is this?

39:05.347 --> 39:07.547
Please don't!

39:44.865 --> 39:46.674
Did you see them?

39:47.118 --> 39:49.035
Not clearly.

39:49.811 --> 39:53.093
I saw a couple of them,
took a shot.

39:53.094 --> 39:55.554
They must have pretty good armor,
because I hit them hard.

39:55.579 --> 39:58.677
- Like the ones from yesterday?
- No, they're bigger. They're our height.

39:58.702 --> 40:01.742
My Marines are dying.
So, you tell me what you know.

40:01.743 --> 40:03.742
You saw them on that ridge.

40:03.743 --> 40:05.951
I'm connected to the network,
So, I see them, yes.

40:05.976 --> 40:07.207
- You do see them.
- Yes.

40:07.232 --> 40:09.249
So, turn the fucking things off,
right now.

40:09.274 --> 40:11.367
- I can't.
- You can't?

40:11.368 --> 40:13.788
Well, you don't seem to have a problem
turning everything else on and off.

40:13.813 --> 40:16.249
I can't just turn them off

40:16.344 --> 40:17.596
There must be a reason.

40:17.621 --> 40:20.326
Programming errors.
I'm running the possibilities.

40:20.327 --> 40:22.489
Look.
This is not a fucking equation.

40:22.514 --> 40:24.084
You just get a hold of
some one right now.

40:24.109 --> 40:25.256
- You get us out of here.
- Okay.

40:25.281 --> 40:28.489
- Or you're going to be the next one getting shot.
- Not like this.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.910
She doesn't know, alright?

40:30.952 --> 40:33.978
- Some programmer screwed up somewhere.
- No. No.

40:34.003 --> 40:36.646
Screw ups aren't so efficient.

40:42.743 --> 40:44.702
I can't find him.

40:44.702 --> 40:46.367
But I found this.

40:46.368 --> 40:48.618
Not too far from here.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.739
We need to find him, sir.

41:03.910 --> 41:06.818
Goodwin, you got rear point.

41:12.535 --> 41:15.117
- Okay, I'm listening.
- She's useful.

41:15.118 --> 41:18.184
We can't see them on the field pads,
we can't see them through the trees.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.034
But, Mills sees them.

41:20.035 --> 41:22.078
Does it occur to you that
If she sees them,

41:22.103 --> 41:24.576
and they see her
and us.

41:24.577 --> 41:25.826
It doesn't matter.

41:25.827 --> 41:28.118
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

41:28.577 --> 41:32.552
Because I'm telling your right now,
we need all the help that we can get.

41:32.577 --> 41:35.742
Did you see the groupings on Hackett?
They hit her 3 times.

41:35.743 --> 41:38.016
The 3rd time while she was
spinning through the fucking air.

41:38.040 --> 41:41.092
I've been thinking about that,
because that's all that I'm thinking about.

41:41.118 --> 41:42.621
They had us.

41:42.646 --> 41:45.214
And they let us walk.
Why?

41:45.239 --> 41:47.596
Let us walk?
What about Cutbill?

41:47.621 --> 41:49.843
Now, they could have
finished everyone of us.

41:49.868 --> 41:52.392
But, while she was there,
they held back.

41:52.417 --> 41:55.061
It's not about her.
Or you.

41:55.086 --> 41:56.686
Bukes.

42:08.745 --> 42:11.823
The used them for target practice.

42:12.285 --> 42:14.243
Like Loftus.

42:23.243 --> 42:25.697
We're being track from the ridge.

42:29.355 --> 42:30.855
Move!

42:57.493 --> 42:58.993
Hold on.

43:01.243 --> 43:04.160
- Where's Bukes?
- I lost track of him.

43:05.493 --> 43:08.718
This is Drifter, anyone copy?

43:10.514 --> 43:12.062
Come on.

43:14.785 --> 43:16.660
Let's keep moving.

43:17.327 --> 43:20.285
Goodwin!
Move!

43:31.702 --> 43:34.747
Bukes, come in, copy.

43:35.155 --> 43:37.321
Solid copy, Drifter.

43:38.035 --> 43:39.777
Who's with you?

43:39.852 --> 43:43.159
I got Goodwin and Robinson. We are
north about a click from the camp.

43:43.184 --> 43:44.684
Good.

43:46.285 --> 43:48.285
Mills is down.

43:49.202 --> 43:50.814
But I found a place to hole up.

43:50.839 --> 43:53.348
- We'll come find you.
- No.

43:54.118 --> 43:56.702
You won't find your way
through the dark.

43:57.035 --> 43:59.615
They'll have no problem picking you off.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.035
Stay put.

44:02.035 --> 44:04.576
We'll regroup as soon
as the light is better.

44:04.577 --> 44:06.034
Over.

44:06.035 --> 44:09.660
- Bukes, copy.
- Copy.

44:09.827 --> 44:13.077
We need her.
Copy.

44:18.868 --> 44:22.412
See you tomorrow.
Over.

46:34.117 --> 46:36.164
How long was I out?

46:36.535 --> 46:38.350
9 hours.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.868
Drink this.

46:50.295 --> 46:52.586
Why didn't you leave me?

46:55.577 --> 46:57.300
I don't know.

46:58.660 --> 47:00.881
I'm still thinking about it.

47:12.243 --> 47:14.428
While you were out of it,

47:15.452 --> 47:19.134
One of those machines
shows up here and...

47:20.535 --> 47:23.201
The two of you had a moment
or something.

47:23.202 --> 47:25.111
We need to find it.

47:26.993 --> 47:28.493
Why?

47:28.702 --> 47:30.680
I can't explain it.

47:39.410 --> 47:41.077
Find a way.

47:45.868 --> 47:47.410
Let's go.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.535
It's good to see you, man.

47:56.535 --> 47:58.110
You too.

48:02.327 --> 48:04.618
Everyone in one piece?

48:06.213 --> 48:07.662
Yeah.

48:08.243 --> 48:10.386
They didn't try for us.

48:10.493 --> 48:12.285
They could have.

48:12.493 --> 48:15.423
As far as I can make out,
they were everywhere last night.

48:15.952 --> 48:17.076
Mills?

48:17.077 --> 48:20.677
Yeah, it looks clear ahead.
All their signals are behind us.

48:20.702 --> 48:23.069
Let's get back to the drop zone.

48:23.094 --> 48:26.010
And wait till someone
sends us a transport.

48:26.035 --> 48:28.368
Let's be ready this time

48:32.660 --> 48:34.785
Stay low, Mills.

48:37.660 --> 48:39.952
He'll need me for the door.

48:40.743 --> 48:42.541
I'll be fine.

48:45.077 --> 48:46.577
Bukes?

48:46.602 --> 48:48.701
Take Mills to the door.

48:48.702 --> 48:50.738
We need her to get in.

48:51.785 --> 48:54.130
Alright.
Copy.

48:57.535 --> 48:59.952
Take it easy down there, Mills.

We need your eyes.

49:17.202 --> 49:18.743
Clear.

49:50.285 --> 49:51.910
Come on.

50:09.035 --> 50:11.192
- Do you want me to handle this?
- Wait here.

50:14.160 --> 50:17.709
- Captain Damien Bukes.
- Wait a moment, please.

50:18.035 --> 50:20.580
Wait a moment, please.

50:41.327 --> 50:44.345

- Okay.

50:48.735 --> 50:50.972
Come on.
Come on.

50:52.285 --> 50:55.049
What happens if they can't
get through the door?

51:03.115 --> 51:04.367
Smoke.

51:04.368 --> 51:06.577
They are using smoke.

51:10.368 --> 51:12.701
They're fucking copying us.

Drifter?

51:22.079 --> 51:24.023

51:43.202 --> 51:45.165

Move!

51:48.160 --> 51:49.672

51:51.183 --> 51:54.134
Drifter, the door is open.

52:11.202 --> 52:14.455

Let's go, Mills.
Now!

55:16.618 --> 55:18.576
I could have saved him.

55:18.577 --> 55:20.636
- No one could have saved him.
- Yes, I could. I could have saved him.

55:20.661 --> 55:22.932
- No way you could have saved him.
- Why didn't you wait. I was telling you to wait.

55:22.957 --> 55:23.977
- There's no way.
- Yes, I could.

55:24.002 --> 55:26.148
- Why...
- I MADE THEM!

55:44.035 --> 55:46.607
This shit no make no sense.

55:55.077 --> 55:57.345
Why are we here, Mills?

55:58.993 --> 56:00.762
I don't know.

56:01.577 --> 56:03.952
Marines come here to train.

56:04.118 --> 56:06.968
I don't know why you're here,
I only know that you were requested.

56:06.993 --> 56:08.451
And you?

56:08.452 --> 56:10.430
Why are you here?

56:14.618 --> 56:17.326
I write the program,
design the prototypes.

56:17.327 --> 56:18.742
This is where they are tested.

56:18.743 --> 56:20.725
Have you had a good look
at what you've done?

56:20.750 --> 56:24.034
- What you've created.
- Nothing like this has ever happened before.

56:24.059 --> 56:26.760
The codes have advanced more
than we ever could have imagined.

56:26.785 --> 56:29.117
But, if I can understand it,
I can try to control it.

56:29.118 --> 56:30.784
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?

56:30.785 --> 56:33.534
-  No, you don't understand.
- Open your eyes, Mills.

56:33.559 --> 56:35.260
They are killers.

56:35.285 --> 56:36.492
That's all they are.

56:36.493 --> 56:40.425
She stood in the middle of that road,

56:40.577 --> 56:42.117
and not one of them took a shoot.

56:42.118 --> 56:44.598
That's because they are trying to
work out if I'm one of them or not.

56:44.623 --> 56:46.061
Yeah.

56:46.925 --> 56:48.827
So are we.

56:51.349 --> 56:53.390
What are they?

56:59.243 --> 57:01.194
They're your replacements.

57:01.219 --> 57:03.385
Replacements?

57:04.702 --> 57:06.951
They're called S.A.R.

57:06.952 --> 57:09.677
Study. Analyze. Reprogram.

57:09.702 --> 57:11.493
They learn.

57:12.077 --> 57:14.576
Given enough to learn from,
then, they improve themselves.

57:14.577 --> 57:16.410
Like us.

57:16.535 --> 57:19.452
We created them to save lives,
and they will.

57:19.743 --> 57:22.034
Whose lives are they going to save?

57:22.035 --> 57:23.576
Cutbill's.

57:23.577 --> 57:24.951
Loftus.

57:24.952 --> 57:26.742
Hackett, Drifter?

57:26.743 --> 57:30.534
We built them so people like you
don't have to die or kill anyone.

57:30.535 --> 57:34.193
That's not up to you.
It's up to me.

57:37.105 --> 57:39.943
And how has that
worked out so far?

57:41.243 --> 57:42.784
I live with it.

57:42.785 --> 57:45.709
So people like you won't have to.

57:47.077 --> 57:49.163
But, you've killed us.

57:49.618 --> 57:51.530
And you know it.

57:53.618 --> 57:55.306
Watch her.

58:17.160 --> 58:20.038
Half an hour and they'll
roll that sucker back.

58:20.368 --> 58:22.367
Do we fight them off here
and wait for the transport?

58:22.368 --> 58:24.428
We won't last that long.

58:25.035 --> 58:27.796
We need to find
a better defensive position.

58:28.868 --> 58:30.794
There's another door.

58:30.912 --> 58:34.235

58:38.796 --> 58:41.213
Well, that would be you, Mills.

58:42.077 --> 58:43.868
Wait a second.

58:43.868 --> 58:47.367
How do we know this door
doesn't just lead right back outside.

58:47.368 --> 58:48.931
Do you want to stay here, Goodwin?

58:48.956 --> 58:52.364
We don't have a choice.
Open it.

59:38.702 --> 59:40.952
I can't see a thing.

59:55.157 --> 59:57.236
Motherfucker.

01:00:19.827 --> 01:00:22.143
Did you turn the lights on?

01:00:24.743 --> 01:00:27.209
Don't turn anything else on.

01:00:28.743 --> 01:00:30.506
Are you alright?

01:00:31.443 --> 01:00:33.148
No, man.

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:36.784
I fucking hate this place.

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:40.740
This is where they test them?

01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:44.080
Unbelievable.

01:00:44.105 --> 01:00:46.862
You should have stopped
when you made these.

01:00:54.035 --> 01:00:55.834
Lock the door.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:00:59.800

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.686

01:01:23.711 --> 01:01:25.211

01:01:25.243 --> 01:01:27.563

01:01:27.679 --> 01:01:29.474
Mills!

01:02:04.202 --> 01:02:06.859
Well, this just gets
better and better.

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:23.593
I can't communicate out,
even from in here.

01:02:24.577 --> 01:02:26.518
It's a bottleneck.

01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:28.787
- We can slow them down from here.
- Charges?

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.702
- Yeah.
- Goodwin.

01:02:35.743 --> 01:02:38.176
- How many have we got?
- We got about 5.

01:02:38.201 --> 01:02:39.492
- 5.
- Yeah.

01:02:39.517 --> 01:02:41.552
That's all we got, Cap.

01:02:45.243 --> 01:02:47.247

they moved away.

Good.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.998
Looks like some kind of training.

01:11:20.535 --> 01:11:23.202

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:08.660
That's all.

01:12:09.868 --> 01:12:11.685
Last one.

01:12:18.243 --> 01:12:19.534
Great.

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.951

01:14:07.992 --> 01:14:09.626
No.

01:14:09.827 --> 01:14:11.531
Are we moving?

01:14:11.556 --> 01:14:13.178
No.

01:14:14.743 --> 01:14:16.655
So this is it.

01:14:21.368 --> 01:14:23.209
What is that?

01:14:26.868 --> 01:14:28.970
It's an EMP.

01:14:29.368 --> 01:14:32.451
When you hit that S.A.R in the tunnel,
it detonated one of them.

01:14:32.476 --> 01:14:35.867
It sends out a pulse that wipes
anything with a current near by.

01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:38.832
We put them in each of them so
the enemy can't steal our technology.

01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:41.889
But, it's range is short.

01:14:42.368 --> 01:14:46.142
I've amped this one up.
All we need now is a detonator.

01:14:51.785 --> 01:14:55.343
There is a leader, the one
who is responsible for all this.

01:14:55.368 --> 01:14:57.034
The S.A.R codes that's
expanding in that one.

01:14:57.035 --> 01:14:58.987
That's the one I need
to be with when I detonate.

01:14:59.012 --> 01:15:02.656
I think that will stop it,
before it goes any further.

01:15:04.327 --> 01:15:07.321
Do you know why they
haven't killed us yet, Bukes?

01:15:07.785 --> 01:15:10.492
Because they have been pushing us, here.

01:15:10.493 --> 01:15:14.405
They'll give you enough time to set up
and then they will come for you.

01:15:15.555 --> 01:15:17.953
But, maybe I can end this.

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:22.077
By killing yourself?

01:15:25.952 --> 01:15:29.626
Even if you survive the blast,
it will wipe you clean.

01:15:31.702 --> 01:15:35.852
At this point,
we have no other option.

01:15:37.577 --> 01:15:41.737
I'll have a small amount of time,
and then, my chip will shut down.

01:15:42.285 --> 01:15:45.056
You can deal with whatever is left.

01:15:45.534 --> 01:15:47.034
No.

01:15:48.118 --> 01:15:50.442
Do you understand what I've done?

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:53.201
Look at this place.

01:15:53.202 --> 01:15:55.410
We can't win this.

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.494
Hey, Robinson.

01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:06.272
What's up, son?

01:16:06.297 --> 01:16:08.245
Maybe you're right.

01:16:09.108 --> 01:16:11.704
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

01:16:12.782 --> 01:16:15.966
You just figured that out now, Goodwin?

01:17:33.496 --> 01:17:37.646
Robinson.
Multiple markers to the south.

01:17:38.493 --> 01:17:40.042
Copy that.

01:17:47.452 --> 01:17:49.034
Draw them in.

01:17:49.035 --> 01:17:53.158
Goodwin, we got eyes on us.
Stay out of sight, over.

01:17:53.285 --> 01:17:54.959
Copy that.

01:18:50.407 --> 01:18:52.219
How many?

01:18:53.339 --> 01:18:54.964
All of them.

01:19:52.077 --> 01:19:55.321
Goodwin, they are in the streets,
east and west. Standby.

01:20:08.975 --> 01:20:12.406
Please, god.
Please, god.

01:20:21.785 --> 01:20:23.781
Goodwin, hit it.

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.256
They lost a few.

01:20:30.281 --> 01:20:32.240
I got something...

01:20:33.241 --> 01:20:36.900
Robinson, 2 broken free from
the main group. Coming in fast.

01:20:55.868 --> 01:20:57.194
That's one more down.

01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:59.052
Marker on it's way from the west.

01:20:59.077 --> 01:21:00.492
I've got him.

01:21:00.493 --> 01:21:02.332
I'm going to fire.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.243
Goodwin, keep your head down.

01:21:06.493 --> 01:21:09.790
Robinson, on me.

01:21:18.829 --> 01:21:20.721
Robinson!

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:35.310
- That's another one.
- Bukes, there's one right on you.

01:21:54.173 --> 01:21:56.292
Goodwin, hit south.

01:22:15.118 --> 01:22:18.372
Mills, where are the rest of them?

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:22.709
Goodwin, they see you.

01:22:28.868 --> 01:22:32.743
Captain, I just got made!
I got to move!

01:22:34.276 --> 01:22:37.335
Robinson.
Cover me.

01:22:43.878 --> 01:22:45.776
Goodwin, don't bail.

01:22:46.754 --> 01:22:50.171
Captain!
Captain!

01:22:50.827 --> 01:22:52.331
Shit!

01:23:00.868 --> 01:23:02.492
Get it off me!

01:23:02.493 --> 01:23:05.495
Get it the fuck off me!

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.535
Captain...

01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:56.966
The detonator.

01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:59.660
I dropped the detonator.

01:24:33.452 --> 01:24:35.489
Bukes, get behind me.

01:24:46.243 --> 01:24:48.552
I don't know how long
this is going to work.

01:24:48.577 --> 01:24:53.917
MESSAGE OF S.A.R
IDENTIFY

01:24:59.997 --> 01:25:02.363
You can't be here, Mills.

01:25:18.243 --> 01:25:20.659
You got to go.
Just run.

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:22.766
No, this is it.

01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:01.855
Hang in there, Mills.

01:26:03.281 --> 01:26:06.501
IRREPARABLE DAMAGE
SHUTTING DOWN TO PROTECT DATA

01:26:41.621 --> 01:26:44.457

IMMINENT

01:27:42.835 --> 01:27:44.526
Robinson.

01:27:46.241 --> 01:27:47.950
Robinson.

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:06.160
Well, come on.

01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:11.055
Well, come on!

01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:14.170
You wanted this!

01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:20.885
Just fucking do it.

01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.826
I have received my orders.

01:28:26.455 --> 01:28:27.988
Come on, finish it!

01:28:27.989 --> 01:28:30.270
More data is required.

01:28:30.295 --> 01:28:33.905
Mills!
Mills!

01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:38.901
More data is required to
complete training combat program.

01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:43.243
You are not identified.

01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:50.114
You are not identified.

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:01.035
Identify.

01:29:05.808 --> 01:29:07.958
Identify.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.921
Human.

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.928
S.A.R

01:31:17.227 --> 01:31:19.564
