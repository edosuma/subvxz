WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.140
(Dogs barking)

00:03.230 --> 00:05.260
(Hollow banging)

01:15.050 --> 01:16.870
(Tyres screech)

01:36.610 --> 01:38.650
(Dogs barking)

01:46.250 --> 01:48.490
(Men talking, indistinct)

01:48.580 --> 01:50.790
(Man) Go and get the dogs.

01:55.090 --> 01:57.490
(Man) Come on, then. Mews!

02:02.510 --> 02:07.390
Come on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

02:07.470 --> 02:10.310
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

02:10.389 --> 02:15.900
Compared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

02:15.980 --> 02:19.480
- this is a three-star supper.
- (Gasping)

02:20.490 --> 02:23.610
You must learn the rules.

02:23.700 --> 02:27.570
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

02:27.660 --> 02:30.450
Have you ever heard of
chicken à la reine Marie

02:30.540 --> 02:32.660
or oyster sauce mornay

02:32.750 --> 02:35.240
or frogs' legs Parisienne?

02:35.340 --> 02:37.380
No. Course you haven't.

02:37.460 --> 02:40.550
Take his pants down! Take his pants down.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.170
(Dogs whimpering)

02:45.260 --> 02:47.390
(Men shouting)

02:48.850 --> 02:51.600
(Man) Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

02:51.690 --> 02:55.220
Didn't your daddy teach you
to wipe your bottom? Eh?

02:55.310 --> 02:57.440
(Woman) Albert! Leave him alone.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.360
- Come on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.190
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

03:06.070 --> 03:09.740
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

03:09.830 --> 03:12.320
She's got a heart of gold and a body to match.

03:12.410 --> 03:17.160
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

03:17.250 --> 03:22.760
And you are Roy, who's got absolutely nothing,
except what you owe me.

03:22.840 --> 03:28.600
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.630
Georgina, I'll be as quick as I possibly can.

03:32.730 --> 03:37.310
Gah... You, go and get me some hot water, eh?
And a towel and soap.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.600
Now...

03:39.690 --> 03:42.310
Yeah. (Laughs)

03:42.400 --> 03:46.230
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.610
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.820
- No, no, no...
- Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

03:52.910 --> 03:56.030
after forcing it through your dick like toothpaste.

03:56.130 --> 04:01.120
No, put that away, Spangler.
Cor blimey, there's a lady present.

04:01.210 --> 04:05.000
She doesn't want to see
your shrivelled contributions.

04:05.090 --> 04:07.050
Ah.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.300
That's it. Thank you very much. Nice, clean...

04:10.390 --> 04:12.840
Give me that towel!

04:12.930 --> 04:15.180
Give me that. Yeah.

04:15.270 --> 04:20.769
I never liked that Chinese food
but looking at you now, I like it even less.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.270
(Laughing) Righto, boys!

04:23.360 --> 04:26.780
We must surprise Richard on our anniversary.

04:26.860 --> 04:29.020
Bring the letters.

04:30.030 --> 04:34.740
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

04:34.830 --> 04:38.330
- You look like a tart in black.
- (Georgina) It's blue.

04:38.420 --> 04:42.080
It's black, and don't smoke. It's sloppy in a woman.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.410
No one who's going to eat smokes.

04:44.510 --> 04:48.630
It ruins your taste buds, burns your tongue
and makes your pee stink.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.130
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.590
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.640
When are you gonna learn, smartarse?

05:00.270 --> 05:07.400
(Boy soprano) Have mercy upon me.

05:07.490 --> 05:11.320
(Albert) Come on, hurry up, boys.

05:11.410 --> 05:14.690
...upon me.

05:16.330 --> 05:21.210
Righto, lads, get them numbers up there -
Spica & Boarst.

05:24.710 --> 05:31.300
Blot out my transgressions

05:32.810 --> 05:39.470
Purge me with hyssop

05:41.520 --> 05:46.180
And I shall be clean

05:48.150 --> 05:51.570
Wash me

05:51.660 --> 05:55.240
Wash me

05:55.330 --> 06:01.990
And I shall be whiter than snow.

06:04.380 --> 06:06.420
(Albert) Where's Richard?

06:06.510 --> 06:09.920
- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

06:10.010 --> 06:12.930
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

06:13.010 --> 06:15.880
Now what's that? A-S-P...

06:15.970 --> 06:20.550
That's nonsense. Spell it right, for Christ's sake.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.310
Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

06:24.400 --> 06:27.100
There you are, Richard. Now...

06:27.190 --> 06:30.400
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

06:30.490 --> 06:34.110
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

06:34.200 --> 06:37.820
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

06:37.910 --> 06:43.420
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favourite restaurateur.

06:43.500 --> 06:47.040
(French accent) Mr Spica, this is a duck.

06:47.130 --> 06:49.580
Ducks are born with the feathers on

06:49.670 --> 06:52.290
but it's your dinner, Mr Spica.

06:52.380 --> 06:57.630
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

06:57.720 --> 07:01.770
I suppose, by leaving the feathers as they are.

07:01.850 --> 07:04.010
Canard en ses plumes torche.

07:05.690 --> 07:07.980
Mitchel, you mule.

07:08.070 --> 07:10.560
'Ere, Richard, come and see, come on.

07:10.650 --> 07:13.860
Please, I beg you. Ha! Come on.

07:16.070 --> 07:20.370
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

07:20.450 --> 07:25.330
- Mitchel, get your arse down here quick. Come on.
- (Cook shouting)

07:25.420 --> 07:30.840
Now, Richard, this is your...well, our new sign.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.210
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

07:33.300 --> 07:35.970
- Wallop!
- (Cheering and applause)

07:42.310 --> 07:44.520
(Albert) Oh, God!

07:45.850 --> 07:47.930
Richard.

07:49.190 --> 07:52.440
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

07:52.530 --> 07:56.990
Thanks to Mr Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

07:59.410 --> 08:03.160
No power, no light.

08:04.290 --> 08:09.530
- Were you thinking of a cold buffet tonight?
- (Albert) But I don't want a cold buffet.

08:09.630 --> 08:15.580
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.590
- Terrine de caneton.
- Terrine de canton.

08:20.680 --> 08:26.600
- Cold turkey with lemon and basilica.
- Cold turkey with the lemon and basilica.

08:26.690 --> 08:28.730
Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

08:28.810 --> 08:32.809
It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

08:32.900 --> 08:35.270
(Wolf whistle)

08:35.360 --> 08:39.110
(Mews) Got an arse on her
like two greased watermelons in a sack.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.400
(Richard) Cold chicken, paté d'alouettes,

08:42.490 --> 08:46.280
salade de langoustine,
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...

08:46.370 --> 08:51.450
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

08:51.550 --> 08:53.580
(Richard) You don't eat.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.710
You don't eat.

08:58.590 --> 09:01.260
I told you not to smoke.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.840
I should stand still, Mr Spica. Or who knows?

09:05.930 --> 09:09.430
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.480
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

09:14.570 --> 09:18.780
some, er, les oh d'oeuvres, er, gâteau au poivres,

09:18.860 --> 09:23.910
er, terrine et fillet lamb et poison au er, poi, poi...

09:23.990 --> 09:27.530
- It's "poisson".
- What did you say, Georgie?

09:27.620 --> 09:30.000
What did you say? What did you say?

09:31.040 --> 09:33.080
Poisson.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.210
(Cheering)

09:35.300 --> 09:37.340
(Whistling)

09:38.680 --> 09:43.630
- Well, Mr Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

09:47.520 --> 09:52.560
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat. (Laughs)

09:56.240 --> 09:59.570
Eh, what do you think then, eh? What do you...?

10:01.620 --> 10:03.660
(Crockery smashes)

10:05.370 --> 10:09.150
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr Spica,

10:09.250 --> 10:12.170
as you waste on the decor,

10:12.250 --> 10:16.880
your taste in good food must surely improve.

10:18.090 --> 10:19.500
(Dogs barking)

10:19.590 --> 10:24.130
(Albert) You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget.

10:24.220 --> 10:28.380
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.970
Look out there, see what I've brought you.

10:31.060 --> 10:34.850
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

10:34.940 --> 10:38.310
- (Richard) I would not touch it.
- (Albert) Why on earth not?

10:38.400 --> 10:42.700
I insist on buying my own food, Mr Spica.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.950
Then I can be sure of its quality.

10:46.030 --> 10:49.700
I represent quality round here,
my name is known for it.

10:49.790 --> 10:53.410
I offer quality and protection.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.130
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr Spica? And whom?

10:58.210 --> 11:02.840
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

11:04.090 --> 11:08.010
Against a sudden arrival of food poisoning.

11:08.720 --> 11:13.100
Against rats. Against the public health inspector.

11:13.190 --> 11:17.730
(Richard) If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

11:17.820 --> 11:21.940
Do up the third button
of your expensive jacket, Mr Spica.

11:22.820 --> 11:28.910
You'll feel less empty inside, Mr Spica.

11:28.990 --> 11:31.320
You can't make me wait.

11:31.410 --> 11:35.830
(Boy soprano) Deliver me

11:35.920 --> 11:43.550
From blood-guiltiness

11:44.930 --> 11:48.260
O God

11:48.350 --> 11:53.640
My tongue shall sing aloud

11:53.730 --> 11:56.890
Of Thy righteousness

11:58.320 --> 12:05.280
Have mercy upon me

12:07.450 --> 12:14.330
Blot out my transgressions

12:15.670 --> 12:25.960
O Lord, open Thou my lips

12:28.550 --> 12:31.560
And my mouth

12:31.640 --> 12:40.350
Shall show forth Thy praise

12:41.360 --> 12:44.150
And my mouth

12:44.240 --> 12:52.610
Shall show forth Thy praise

12:53.500 --> 12:56.030
And my mouth

12:56.120 --> 13:04.420
Shall show forth Thy praise

13:05.090 --> 13:07.760
And my mouth

13:07.840 --> 13:15.800
Shall show forth Thy praise.

13:45.050 --> 13:48.130
No, you don't eat it like that! Let me show you.

13:48.220 --> 13:52.460
Oh. lmagine you are sucking
the little fingers of a lady or...

13:52.550 --> 13:58.180
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

13:58.270 --> 14:02.650
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

14:02.730 --> 14:06.940
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on yourjacket.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.980
Look at yourjacket, it's like a pig field.

14:10.070 --> 14:13.240
And your nails could do with a clean. Show me.

14:14.200 --> 14:19.030
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

14:19.120 --> 14:23.540
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

14:23.630 --> 14:27.460
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

14:28.220 --> 14:33.420
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst? (Belches)

14:33.510 --> 14:37.720
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.840
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

14:40.940 --> 14:45.060
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand -

14:45.150 --> 14:48.730
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

14:48.820 --> 14:51.900
You told Mews to eat the celery with his fingers.

14:51.990 --> 14:56.320
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

14:56.410 --> 15:02.410
What's the point of sinking thousands
into a restaurant if you refuse to eat properly?

15:02.500 --> 15:06.330
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

15:06.420 --> 15:11.170
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Cory, get Richard in here.

15:11.260 --> 15:15.880
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

15:15.970 --> 15:20.510
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

15:21.520 --> 15:23.760
- This place is too dark.
- (Belches)

15:23.850 --> 15:27.690
Could do with a respray. Gold, it needs more gold.

15:27.770 --> 15:30.270
How about gold and blue?

15:31.200 --> 15:35.490
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

15:35.570 --> 15:39.410
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

15:40.290 --> 15:44.750
His head's in the clouds. Good cook. Brilliant cook!

15:44.830 --> 15:49.630
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

15:49.710 --> 15:52.920
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

15:53.010 --> 15:57.420
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

15:57.510 --> 16:01.510
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

16:03.100 --> 16:08.520
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

16:08.610 --> 16:14.190
What you've got to realise is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

16:14.280 --> 16:17.900
like duck and orange, like pineapple and ham.

16:17.990 --> 16:20.030
It's called artistry.

16:20.120 --> 16:24.370
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.860
Money's my business, eating's my pleasure.

16:26.960 --> 16:31.290
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

16:31.380 --> 16:35.210
than stuffing the mouth and feeding the sewers.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.420
Though the pleasures are related,

16:37.510 --> 16:43.180
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

16:44.060 --> 16:48.690
that itjust goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

16:48.770 --> 16:52.820
Georgie's naughty bits
are nicely related, aren't they?

16:52.900 --> 16:56.020
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie.

16:56.110 --> 16:57.740
(Gasps)

16:57.820 --> 17:03.160
(Albert) Get Phillipe! In future, I want my napkins
folded at home, Georgina. Get Adele to teach you.

17:04.869 --> 17:07.280
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

17:07.369 --> 17:11.369
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

17:11.460 --> 17:15.250
Get Adele to get that water
with the angostura bitters in it

17:15.339 --> 17:19.750
and some lemon in the water
and a bowl of ice water for me fingers...

17:19.849 --> 17:24.589
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.640
This should look the most important table here.

17:28.730 --> 17:32.180
I like a load of glasses around, it highers the tone.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.540
- What's that?
- For Madame Spica, compliments of the house.

17:51.630 --> 17:54.710
She's no Madame. Why haven't I got one?

17:54.800 --> 17:58.880
- I doubt, Mr Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

18:00.090 --> 18:04.310
We have grown accustomed
to you being a conservative eater.

18:04.390 --> 18:07.810
That's not true. I'm as adventurous as the next.

18:07.890 --> 18:11.010
Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr Spica.

18:11.100 --> 18:14.140
It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.

19:59.340 --> 20:04.420
(Albert) I want one of those hot, damp towels,
Richard, served to me with tongs.

20:05.510 --> 20:10.590
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.680
- We'll replace her.
- (Mitchel) Can I do the replacing?

20:13.770 --> 20:19.770
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel. Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

20:54.390 --> 20:56.930
(Albert) Georgina! Welcome back.

20:57.020 --> 21:00.770
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum? (Laughs)

21:00.860 --> 21:05.900
You never know what you can catch these days.
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

21:05.990 --> 21:12.360
That's for you. Richard thought I might like
to taste it, personal compliments of the chef.

21:12.450 --> 21:15.870
Eat it. I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

21:16.790 --> 21:19.880
lris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

21:19.960 --> 21:25.710
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WC to clear it.

21:27.220 --> 21:31.170
Some of it splashed on the seat.
lris ran screaming into the street,

21:31.260 --> 21:33.340
her backside hissing.

21:33.430 --> 21:35.390
She hasn't been the same since.

21:35.480 --> 21:40.550
She strips the same
but never with her back to the audience.

21:40.650 --> 21:44.980
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full- frontal.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.270
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

21:48.360 --> 21:51.120
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

21:51.200 --> 21:56.440
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.910
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.490
like you've just come over from Paris.

22:02.590 --> 22:07.210
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that "parlez- vous français?"

22:07.300 --> 22:10.340
Then you would not understand me, Mr Spica.

22:10.430 --> 22:14.670
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

22:14.770 --> 22:16.800
(Laughter)

23:30.590 --> 23:33.000
(Door opens)

23:40.520 --> 23:42.560
(Water running)

24:50.250 --> 24:52.000
(Door opens)

24:52.090 --> 24:54.000
Georgina!

24:54.090 --> 24:56.660
What the hell are you doing in here?

24:57.890 --> 25:00.560
Georgina?

25:00.640 --> 25:04.850
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

25:04.940 --> 25:07.310
I'm, er, I'm just...

25:07.980 --> 25:12.060
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

25:14.030 --> 25:17.560
You know how you hate me smoking at the table.

25:17.660 --> 25:20.150
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.200
Why tell me lies about a lost lighter?

25:23.290 --> 25:28.160
(Georgina) I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

25:30.250 --> 25:32.540
I'll be out in a few moments.

25:32.630 --> 25:37.380
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.510
Show me the lighter.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.130
(Georgina) There.

25:44.390 --> 25:46.600
Do you want a cigarette as well?

25:46.690 --> 25:49.090
Don't be so bloody stupid.

25:49.190 --> 25:53.440
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh? (Laughs)

25:53.530 --> 25:55.650
You playing with yourself?

25:55.740 --> 26:00.450
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

26:00.530 --> 26:05.820
- Shut up, Albert.
- Let me in, I'll show you how to wipe yourself.

26:06.910 --> 26:09.370
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.410
Well, don't be long.

26:12.500 --> 26:16.670
I'll order you some gâteau aux poivres.

26:17.470 --> 26:19.840
Some profiteroles.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.050
And wash your hands.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.140
You don't know the women who use this place.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.110
- (Door closes)
- (Sighs)

27:32.080 --> 27:34.570
(Toilet flushes)

27:34.670 --> 27:36.710
(Sighs quietly)

27:39.380 --> 27:41.500
You took your time.

27:42.470 --> 27:45.140
I thought you'd like me to wait for you.

27:46.850 --> 27:49.090
You smell nice and sweaty.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.720
Wash your hands, I'll give you a kiss.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.360
(Water running)

28:06.780 --> 28:11.160
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

28:14.370 --> 28:18.590
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

28:18.670 --> 28:22.880
- They're asking to have their illusions shattered.
- Yeah.

28:22.970 --> 28:26.250
You hold no illusions for me, Georgie, eh?

28:26.350 --> 28:28.720
No stone's been left unturned.

28:28.810 --> 28:32.310
Look, just go order my profiteroles, will you?

28:32.390 --> 28:34.630
Come on.

28:36.940 --> 28:38.980
Come on.

29:13.060 --> 29:15.100
(Laughter)

29:22.650 --> 29:26.070
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

29:26.160 --> 29:32.660
It keeps them slim and graceful, with those
big heads and dreamy eyes. You know those kids.

29:32.740 --> 29:37.290
- (Georgina) You're sick.
- (Albert) I might well be if you're being so priggish.

29:37.370 --> 29:43.210
(Woman) What do you know, Georgina, about
the starving? You can have anything you want.

29:43.300 --> 29:48.640
- Where you been? You're late.
- It's Friday night. There's a lot of money about.

29:49.970 --> 29:54.720
A decent man needs gloves to touch this stuff.
Let's have a look.

29:54.810 --> 29:57.730
That's just what this restaurant needs.

29:57.810 --> 30:00.520
- Start laying them out.
- (Belches)

30:00.610 --> 30:04.060
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

30:04.150 --> 30:07.520
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

30:07.610 --> 30:10.190
Don't you dare throw up in here!

30:10.280 --> 30:13.780
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

30:13.870 --> 30:19.820
(Cory) From the Malay restaurant.
The food poisoning scared them, they're paying up.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.000
I'm sure they don't need our assistance with that.

30:23.090 --> 30:26.500
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

30:26.590 --> 30:30.970
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

30:31.050 --> 30:34.800
The same water would go round and round.

30:34.890 --> 30:39.720
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

30:39.810 --> 30:44.190
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

30:44.270 --> 30:47.480
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

30:47.570 --> 30:51.230
Georgie and I have our little sessions when we...

30:51.320 --> 30:53.610
Good God, what have you got there?

30:53.700 --> 30:58.240
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

30:58.330 --> 31:01.950
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

31:02.040 --> 31:08.580
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

31:08.670 --> 31:13.470
Albert, why don't you order me some chianti?
You know I like chianti.

31:13.550 --> 31:16.180
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

31:16.270 --> 31:19.470
Then I can take it home and hang it on the wall.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.560
- Grace, haven't you got enough of them already?
- No.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.770
Where the hell are you going?

31:25.860 --> 31:29.480
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

31:29.570 --> 31:33.700
She's got a bladder like a leaky marrow.
Don't be long!

31:33.780 --> 31:36.950
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

31:37.040 --> 31:43.240
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

31:44.590 --> 31:46.620
Wash your hands!

32:05.860 --> 32:08.480
- Questo, questo.
- Cazzo.

32:08.570 --> 32:11.440
Dove hai imparato a cucinare? É velenoso.

32:11.530 --> 32:13.770
Vieni qua.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.830
That's off!

34:55.900 --> 34:57.940
Uh.

34:58.030 --> 35:01.980
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

35:02.070 --> 35:04.110
Can I help you, Mr Spica?

35:04.200 --> 35:07.740
I've come about
those special complimentary dishes.

35:07.830 --> 35:11.580
In future, all the guests at my table
shall receive them.

35:11.670 --> 35:14.210
Why is my fish taking so long?

35:14.290 --> 35:17.630
You can carry it in yourself, if you like, Mr Spica.

35:19.170 --> 35:22.710
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

35:22.800 --> 35:27.680
- (Richard) You would not be looking for your wife?
- No, of course not.

35:27.770 --> 35:30.850
Mr Spica, I have something to show you.

35:43.950 --> 35:49.070
- What is this?
- New cutlery. Give your restaurant some style.

35:49.160 --> 35:53.740
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

35:56.550 --> 35:58.920
Not very good quality, Mr Spica.

36:00.010 --> 36:04.470
You could use them at home, Mr Spica.

36:04.550 --> 36:07.310
All 300 of them.

36:44.050 --> 36:46.670
Where have you been? Wiping your bum?

36:46.760 --> 36:50.210
Did you use your left hand like I showed you?

36:50.310 --> 36:54.140
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

36:54.230 --> 36:59.060
Take 'em back. Get a 150º/. refund. God.

37:00.570 --> 37:05.190
What are you eating, Georgie? Not much.

37:05.280 --> 37:10.030
Ha! I see others here
get the same special attentions.

37:10.120 --> 37:15.280
What is it? Looks like
some sort of...watery salade.

37:15.370 --> 37:17.660
That's not up to much.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.870
Expensive, no doubt, but not fattening.

37:20.960 --> 37:24.380
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

37:24.470 --> 37:27.590
Kidneys, liver, iron, that's what you need.

37:27.680 --> 37:33.850
Do you know a cow drinks
its own weight in water twice a week?

37:33.930 --> 37:38.640
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

37:38.730 --> 37:41.100
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

37:44.610 --> 37:48.660
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

37:48.740 --> 37:52.280
for some reason best known to herself,

37:52.370 --> 37:54.530
she's left her bra off.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.750
Have you, Cory, ever tasted human milk?

38:00.670 --> 38:04.420
I mean recently. All them years ago don't count.

38:04.510 --> 38:09.250
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

38:09.340 --> 38:15.300
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

38:16.230 --> 38:19.930
Do you know, Cory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

38:20.020 --> 38:24.320
(Spangler) Warm, straight from the receptacle,
so to speak?

38:24.400 --> 38:28.480
Don'tjoke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

38:28.570 --> 38:31.320
Georgie wouldn'tjoke about it, would you?

38:31.410 --> 38:33.480
Would you, Georgie?

38:33.580 --> 38:39.080
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could show
these young women a thing or two.

38:39.170 --> 38:43.080
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

38:43.170 --> 38:46.870
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

38:46.970 --> 38:50.750
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

38:52.640 --> 38:56.260
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

38:57.850 --> 39:00.390
I want kids.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.440
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

39:08.240 --> 39:11.610
When you're bloody old and grey, most like!

39:11.700 --> 39:15.360
Yeah. Your trouble is you don't eat properly.

39:16.290 --> 39:20.450
You should drink more water and eat more kidneys

39:20.540 --> 39:24.590
and then you might bloody well have
a bloody baby someday.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.880
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

39:28.970 --> 39:34.170
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

39:34.260 --> 39:36.300
What days are those, then, Albert?

39:36.390 --> 39:38.430
- What's it like?
- You what?

39:38.520 --> 39:43.260
Get away from this table, you mucky little wimp!

39:43.360 --> 39:48.400
Go and eat your vegetable soup in the kitchen,
you dirty little pervert!

39:48.490 --> 39:51.610
Go on, get on with your eating, eh?

39:51.700 --> 39:54.900
It's only Mitchel making a fool of himself.

39:54.990 --> 39:57.990
Now, stand in the corner.
Cory, make him a paper hat.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.250
Stand in the corner like a naughty little boy.

40:01.330 --> 40:04.670
Stand there. Take your knife and fork with you.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.540
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

40:07.630 --> 40:14.590
Leave him alone. He's only copying you
like he always does. You behave, he'll behave.

40:14.680 --> 40:17.550
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

40:17.640 --> 40:22.630
Gracie, here. Pay the bill and take a taxi.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.820
Yeah. Georgie and I might go for a little drive.

40:29.650 --> 40:32.770
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

40:32.860 --> 40:35.530
Might drive down to the sea,

40:35.620 --> 40:38.530
have some fun under the pier like we used to.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.880
Oops. I am sorry.

40:51.970 --> 40:55.830
Still, this isn't a library, it's a restaurant.

40:55.930 --> 40:57.970
They got people for that.

41:01.430 --> 41:03.470
Richard.

41:03.560 --> 41:07.890
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.150
(Mutters in French)

41:18.530 --> 41:22.910
(Boy soprano) Wash me thoroughly

41:23.000 --> 41:26.910
From my iniquity

41:27.000 --> 41:32.420
And cleanse me....

41:32.510 --> 41:35.540
What's a young lad like you doing
washing dishes?

41:35.630 --> 41:38.800
That's woman's work,
ain't you got what it takes? Hey!

41:38.890 --> 41:43.430
My God, armour plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

41:43.520 --> 41:46.680
lnnocence. That's what I had before I met Georgie.

41:46.770 --> 41:50.190
- That's just what they want.
- Albert. Come on, you're drunk.

41:50.270 --> 41:52.430
- Come on!
- Shall I sing for you?

41:52.530 --> 41:55.560
- What?
- Albert, come on, he's only a child.

41:55.650 --> 41:59.320
Sing for me, yes. Yes, you can sing for me.

41:59.410 --> 42:01.860
Get up there. You sing, yeah.

42:01.950 --> 42:06.700
I was a good singer when I was a little boy,
wasn't I, Georgie?

42:06.790 --> 42:09.830
Come on, now. You sing to me. Eh?

42:10.790 --> 42:12.950
Come on. Sing, damn you!

42:14.670 --> 42:18.890
Wash me thoroughly

42:18.970 --> 42:22.670
- From my iniquity
- (Albert laughs)

42:22.760 --> 42:26.980
- And cleanse....
- You can't keep it up, can you? No.

42:27.060 --> 42:29.390
I was a choirboy once.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.560
Yes. Women like choirboys.

42:32.650 --> 42:36.310
I was almost a choirboy when I met Georgie.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.190
But you spoilt all that, didn't you?

42:39.280 --> 42:43.740
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

42:43.830 --> 42:48.240
Come on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

42:48.330 --> 42:51.120
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

42:51.210 --> 42:54.460
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

42:55.550 --> 42:59.050
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Come on.

42:59.130 --> 43:02.220
Out in the car park. Come on.

43:06.600 --> 43:11.350
I'll give you the best education,
show you what a great teacher Georgie can be.

43:11.440 --> 43:13.600
- (Boy whimpering)
- Don't touch him!

43:13.690 --> 43:17.940
(Georgina) Leave him alone.
(Albert) I'll show you what a great teacher...

43:18.030 --> 43:23.110
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.740
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

43:25.830 --> 43:28.620
- Stand there and don't you move.
- (Dogs barking)

43:28.710 --> 43:30.750
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

43:30.830 --> 43:35.250
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

43:35.340 --> 43:39.880
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

43:39.970 --> 43:43.500
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

43:43.600 --> 43:47.760
With Cory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

43:47.850 --> 43:50.220
Where are they? Give them to me at once.

43:50.310 --> 43:54.640
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

43:54.730 --> 43:58.480
Why don't you take everything off?

43:58.570 --> 44:03.070
- Get in there. Go on! Get in that car!
- (Georgina gasping)

44:03.160 --> 44:06.910
- Now you! You get in there as well.
- No!

44:06.990 --> 44:10.780
- Go on. Get in there. Get in.
- No! Please!

44:11.540 --> 44:15.210
- No! No! No!
- Get in there! Get in.

44:15.290 --> 44:17.420
Aah! Ah!

44:21.930 --> 44:24.630
- (Albert) Right...
- (Glass smashes)

44:24.720 --> 44:26.930
(Georgina screaming) No!

44:33.150 --> 44:37.310
Wash me thoroughly

44:37.400 --> 44:41.270
From my iniquity

44:42.400 --> 44:50.740
And cleanse me from my sins

44:52.580 --> 44:59.300
Have mercy upon me....

45:01.670 --> 45:03.830
I have two minutes.

45:28.740 --> 45:36.650
Purge me with hyssop

45:39.250 --> 45:41.380
And I shall be

45:42.630 --> 45:44.750
Clean

45:46.300 --> 45:49.720
Wash me

45:49.810 --> 45:53.470
Wash me

45:53.560 --> 46:01.220
And I shall be whiter than snow

46:03.150 --> 46:06.940
Make me to hear

46:07.030 --> 46:15.990
- Thy joy and gladness.
- (Glasses reverberate)

46:16.080 --> 46:18.620
That the bones

46:18.710 --> 46:27.710
That Thou hast broken may rejoice.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.610
Do you know, Mitchel, what prairie oysters are?

47:32.660 --> 47:34.700
Fish.

47:34.790 --> 47:39.280
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

47:39.370 --> 47:43.450
Fish. Like from the lakes and that. They're the...

47:43.540 --> 47:46.080
The clams with the little pearls in.

47:47.010 --> 47:50.710
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

47:50.800 --> 47:52.840
No, look. lmagine...

47:52.930 --> 47:57.090
Just imagine that this is a prairie oyster.

47:57.180 --> 48:01.350
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.110
Now, what's it taste like?

48:06.360 --> 48:08.560
- Wet bread.
- No.

48:08.650 --> 48:11.570
It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.

48:13.320 --> 48:15.610
That's the sand.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.540
That's the sand. You're a comic.

48:20.620 --> 48:24.290
No, you mule. It's got a skin round it.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.660
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.960
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards, chump it up.

48:33.050 --> 48:36.220
Now, swallow that, go on, swallow it. Swallow it.

48:36.310 --> 48:38.340
Go on, that's right.

48:38.430 --> 48:42.680
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.640
The next time I ask you to work for me, Mitchel,

48:51.740 --> 48:55.690
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

48:57.490 --> 48:59.530
Oh, you're back.

48:59.620 --> 49:05.080
What do you find in that toilet that's so fascinating?
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

49:05.170 --> 49:10.210
What have they got since I was last in there?
Velvet seats, dirty pictures? Hah.

49:10.300 --> 49:13.920
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

49:44.750 --> 49:47.540
Cor, what a disgusting smell in here!

49:47.630 --> 49:51.410
Must be the pigs using it, eh? How disgusting it is.

49:51.510 --> 49:55.670
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

49:55.760 --> 49:59.050
Revolting place, needs airing out. What's this?

49:59.140 --> 50:01.590
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

50:02.720 --> 50:07.680
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was..."

50:07.770 --> 50:12.150
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

50:12.230 --> 50:15.400
Absolutely appalling. Not what I'm used to at all.

50:15.490 --> 50:19.070
It's disgraceful. Don't you reckon, don't you think?

50:19.160 --> 50:21.360
Yes. God.

50:21.450 --> 50:24.660
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

50:24.750 --> 50:29.120
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

50:29.210 --> 50:32.460
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

50:32.550 --> 50:35.580
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

50:35.670 --> 50:39.840
And you are out on the street.
Caught loitering in a toilet.

50:39.930 --> 50:42.420
- Ow!
- Yeah.

50:42.510 --> 50:47.810
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.520
Hello. What are you doing? Reading again?

50:57.610 --> 51:02.770
This is not a library. The only thing
you're allowed to read in here is the menu.

51:02.870 --> 51:05.410
You are insulting the chef.

51:05.500 --> 51:08.750
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

51:08.830 --> 51:11.160
Don't read at the table.

51:13.500 --> 51:17.370
I've just been reading stuff to make your hair curl.

51:17.470 --> 51:19.710
Out there, in the toilet.

51:19.800 --> 51:23.010
That's the sort of stuff people read, not this.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.550
Don't you feel out of touch?

51:25.640 --> 51:28.100
Does this stuff make money?

51:28.190 --> 51:32.730
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

51:32.820 --> 51:36.480
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

51:36.570 --> 51:39.190
It makes you think, doesn't it?

51:39.280 --> 51:43.610
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

51:43.700 --> 51:48.330
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

51:48.410 --> 51:50.660
Come and meet my wife.

51:50.750 --> 51:56.290
(Laughs) She's seen you.
I know she's sorry for you sitting here all alone.

51:56.380 --> 52:01.540
She likes to read too.
She spends hours sitting on the bed reading.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.260
She even reads on the john.

52:11.480 --> 52:13.720
This is Cory.

52:15.730 --> 52:20.190
This is Mitchel. He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

52:20.280 --> 52:23.480
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Comics and dirty magazines.

52:24.320 --> 52:28.190
And this is Georgina. She is my wife.

52:29.790 --> 52:31.950
What's your name?

52:33.040 --> 52:37.750
- Michael.
- Well, Michael. Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

52:37.840 --> 52:43.290
Do you eat kosher food, Michael? Sit down,
Michael, and tell us all about kosher food, Michael.

52:43.390 --> 52:46.420
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

52:46.510 --> 52:51.090
60º/. of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

52:51.190 --> 52:53.430
Richard, set another place for Michael.

52:53.520 --> 52:58.730
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

52:59.940 --> 53:05.400
He won't need those.
We're going to hold a conversation, aren't we?

53:05.490 --> 53:09.410
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

53:10.370 --> 53:14.700
- I'm sure your wife would rather eat in peace.
- No. Talk, Georgina.

53:14.790 --> 53:18.540
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

53:18.630 --> 53:20.750
Tell Michael you live in a big house

53:20.840 --> 53:23.590
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

53:23.680 --> 53:25.750
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

53:25.840 --> 53:29.180
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

53:29.260 --> 53:33.100
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

53:33.190 --> 53:36.020
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

53:36.100 --> 53:39.440
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

53:39.530 --> 53:42.310
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

53:44.530 --> 53:48.200
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

53:48.280 --> 53:52.360
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

53:52.450 --> 53:55.740
- I go to a good gynaecologist.
- You what?

53:55.830 --> 54:00.790
- Who says it's unlikely I'll ever have a baby.
- Michael doesn't want to know that.

54:00.880 --> 54:04.330
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

54:04.420 --> 54:08.010
That isn't true, Michael doesn't need to know that.

54:08.100 --> 54:12.180
Now, drink up, Michael, let's talk about you.
What do you do?

54:14.560 --> 54:16.930
I'm a gynaecologist.

54:18.360 --> 54:21.560
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

54:21.650 --> 54:24.220
We don't need to discuss that subject.

54:24.320 --> 54:28.150
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

54:28.240 --> 54:30.360
Shut up, Georgie!

54:33.870 --> 54:36.490
I must apologise for my wife, Michael.

54:37.880 --> 54:42.120
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

54:42.210 --> 54:44.290
The place gets very full about now.

54:44.380 --> 54:48.920
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

54:49.010 --> 54:51.720
Oh, it's all right, Mr Spica, thank you.

54:52.760 --> 54:55.140
I prefer to read my book.

54:55.980 --> 54:58.510
Besides, I've finished. Thank you.

54:59.940 --> 55:03.350
Thank you for introducing me to your wife.

55:03.440 --> 55:06.440
I like your name.

55:54.540 --> 55:56.570
(Georgina) Ah.

56:00.120 --> 56:04.040
- What the hell do you think you're doing? Eh?
- (Knife being sharpened)

56:04.130 --> 56:10.300
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

56:10.380 --> 56:13.010
It's not about us. It's about me.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.630
It's about us!

56:15.720 --> 56:19.220
And what's all this,
how much time you spend in that loo?

56:19.310 --> 56:22.430
What's all this about a gynaecologist? Who is he?

56:22.520 --> 56:27.860
It'd better be a she.
I don't want some bloke fingering my wife about.

56:27.940 --> 56:31.190
It's a man. He's Jewish.

56:31.280 --> 56:35.690
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

56:35.780 --> 56:39.730
His mother is a Roman Catholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

56:39.870 --> 56:43.920
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.240
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

56:46.340 --> 56:50.120
You lying, ungrateful bitch! You get in that car.

56:50.220 --> 56:52.750
It's the doghouse for you, you bitch.

56:52.840 --> 56:57.800
Bloody gynaecologist. Blasted gynaecologist.

56:57.890 --> 57:00.460
(Dogs barking)

57:00.560 --> 57:02.770
Get up. Get up.

57:05.060 --> 57:08.100
Get in the car, you slag.

57:09.440 --> 57:11.600
Get in there. Go on.

57:14.700 --> 57:16.740
Yeah.

57:18.160 --> 57:20.200
(Dogs yelp)

57:42.560 --> 57:44.600
(Albert) Maiser came here.

57:44.690 --> 57:49.560
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

57:49.650 --> 57:51.860
- (Woman) Peaches?
- lmitation.

57:51.940 --> 57:56.610
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high- wire professionals.

57:56.700 --> 57:59.070
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

57:59.160 --> 58:06.370
And Tim Tranter drank soup here
out of a cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

58:06.460 --> 58:11.700
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Capps threw a plate of kippers.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.420
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

58:14.510 --> 58:16.880
(Woman) You wouldn't find kippers here.

58:16.970 --> 58:20.970
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- (Man) You've had breakfast here?

58:21.060 --> 58:24.090
The ferryman and his lady ate here every morning.

58:24.180 --> 58:28.560
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

58:28.650 --> 58:33.020
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

58:33.110 --> 58:36.400
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

58:36.490 --> 58:40.270
..gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

58:40.370 --> 58:42.660
(Albert) I've got the clippings at home.

58:42.740 --> 58:45.860
..bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

58:45.960 --> 58:48.530
- (Albert) Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

58:48.630 --> 58:53.870
(Albert) You're getting very smart.
(Cory) Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

58:53.960 --> 58:57.500
(Albert) Now I'm the clientele,
you understand? Me.

58:57.590 --> 59:01.590
And Georgie here and Cory Peterson.
The coq au vin is good.

59:01.680 --> 59:05.810
(Man) Cock a what?
(Albert) Chicken cooked in wine, you mule.

59:05.890 --> 59:10.350
- Bess Riddle lived on coq au vin.
- (Man) More of the coq than the vin.

59:10.440 --> 59:14.190
- (Grace laughing)
- (Albert) Starkie, there are ladies present.

59:14.280 --> 59:18.190
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

59:18.280 --> 59:21.610
- (Grace) She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

59:21.700 --> 59:25.530
(Albert) There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the john.

59:25.620 --> 59:29.070
(Man) And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

59:29.170 --> 59:31.460
(Man) Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

59:31.540 --> 59:35.960
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

59:36.720 --> 59:40.550
- (Mitchel) Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
- (Albert) Shut your mouth.

59:40.640 --> 59:44.970
You'd pee in your pants
before you'd recognise a respectable WC.

59:53.480 --> 59:56.520
So, he's broken the silence for us

59:58.030 --> 01:00:00.190
and your name is Georgina.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:07.240
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:11.830
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:20.420
And you have a beautiful prick, Mr Gynaecologist.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:25.960
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.270
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.770
Why?

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.990
Why what?

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.740
Why am I married to him?

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.500
Why aren't you married?

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:55.200
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.210
- I'm not.
- Why?

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:10.510
I once saw a film in which the main character
didn't speak for the first half an hour.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.840
Like us? Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:24.190
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.400
And then?

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:31.660
He spoilt it - he spoke.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:37.160
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.460
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.340
It was only a film.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.390
Erm, now, we've been talking for one minute.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.100
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.730
Four minutes. That's enough.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.980
Where's the bomb?

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:12.530
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:15.910
With his fingers.

01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:19.790
Kiss me.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:29.300
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.220
I like a quiet restaurant, with floor shows.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:36.140
Boarst is a culinary artist, not a fancy entertainer.

01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:39.850
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:44.190
Cory, phone Santini. Five girls - strippers.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.280
Make it decent, will you? My daughter's present.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.360
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.570
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.240
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

01:02:59.330 --> 01:03:03.500
If they call me Mr Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:06.870
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:10.800
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:14.420
- Shut your whore up, Cory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.430
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.900
Patricia, Mr Fitch.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:24.030
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

01:03:24.110 --> 01:03:28.110
We'd like to see you get up and dance, with Geoff.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.440
Geoff's a very good dancer.

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:34.230
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:36.820
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:41.960
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.200
I'd like to see.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.750
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:56.010
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:00.260
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:02.560
That means immediately.

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:07.230
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Cory.
- She's only practising her French.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.730
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.300
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.430
(Georgina laughs)

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:45.010
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.070
We could be interrupted, um... 700 times.

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:57.780
- What's your boyfriend paying you, Patricia?
- Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

01:04:57.870 --> 01:05:00.790
He buys me meals and drinks.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:03.910
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.700
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.080
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:14.540
(Sniffs) Phew, it stinks here.

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.470
Listen, how about if...

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.720
if I gave you some pocket money?

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:26.100
What do I have to do to earn it?

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:50.380
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.010
Phillipe, clear those tables. We need more space.

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:57.210
- But Mr Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.470
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:03.680
We're in the middle of our meal.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:08.430
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:12.890
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.360
Hold him. Hold him.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:18.570
(Gasping, screaming)

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:22.320
It's a pity you didn't take my advice.

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:25.860
All that lovely food. Richard will be disappointed.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.910
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:34.460
Hey, what is your name?

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.220
What did you say? Did I hear you say William?

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.220
Well, naughty little Willie, tiny little Willie,

01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:45.680
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:47.810
(Gasping)

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.150
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:04.370
you, I'm gonna give you five, the count of five

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.320
and I want to see you on the way to the kitchen

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.490
or you'll be out in the street!

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:12.630
Get out.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.920
(Shouting)

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.380
(Screaming)

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:25.430
(. Cabaret singer)

01:07:27.350 --> 01:07:32.010
. I am waiting, I am waiting

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:37.360
. Come up with something sometime now

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:43.410
. We're only here for love....

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:47.030
- Oh, look at the time. I must go back.
- One minute more.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.830
- No.
- 30 seconds.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.470
(Fitch grunting)

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.140
Oh! Oh!

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.720
Oh. What the hell are you doing?

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:12.010
I bought meself a ride. Why don't you keep still?

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:14.430
Sorry, I had a surprise.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:19.899
What bloody surprises
could there be possibly left for you?

01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:22.109
I give up, you bitch.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.649
I'm sick ofjumpy whores.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:31.750
You're only worth a Fitch one star -
that ain't for looks, that's for availability.

01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:34.160
I am waiting

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.330
I am waiting

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.550
Come up with something sometime now

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:47.720
We're only here for love

01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:51.300
Outside the reach of money

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.800
Beyond the reach of fame

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:58.479
We're not for buying or lending out....

01:08:58.569 --> 01:09:01.609
Look who's just come out of the woodwork.

01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:09.319
Be quick and be tight

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.120
And be it not and be right

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.960
Then be slow and....

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.710
- (Cory) What've you been doing?
- I've just been earning you good money.

01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:24.580
And I've just seen
how we can earn ourselves some more.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:28.880
Then go.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.140
(Cheering, applause)

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:37.479
(Hollow banging, dogs barking)

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:44.359
(lnspector) We have complaints of offensive smells
from two vans on the restaurant premises.

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.569
The restaurant denies any responsibility. Over.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.330
(Police radio)

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:52.450
Why can't we meet somewhere else?

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:57.120
That's impossible.
It's better to do it under his nose.

01:09:57.210 --> 01:10:01.160
He'll never believe I do it right under his nose

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:05.420
between courses,

01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:08.470
between the hors d'oeuvres
and the canard à I'orange,

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.600
between the dessert and the coffee.

01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:14.380
Besides,

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.600
I'm learning fast

01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:20.940
how to cut corners, save time.

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:26.610
I'm getting good at it, aren't I, Michael? Aren't I?

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.110
Aren't I getting good at it? Aren't I?

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.820
Aren't I getting good at it? Mm.

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:37.880
Aren't I getting good at it? Oh.

01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:41.040
(Dogs barking, police radio)

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:47.750
(Albert) Last night was bloody awful
and you're to blame, Cory.

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:51.760
- Tonight you'll starve.
- I don't like the foreign muck anyway.

01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:56.930
Don't talk to me like that, you uneducated prat!
You couldn't organise a rape in a brothel!

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:03.100
The girls were lousy, the music was lousy,
you mucked the whole thing up.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:06.480
Couldn't keep your own girl
under control at all. Tch!

01:11:06.570 --> 01:11:09.360
- First she shows off...
- I didn't.

01:11:09.450 --> 01:11:11.990
Shut your face, who's talking to you?

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.320
Then she goes and plays hard to get.

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:18.960
I mean, if she's been with you, Cory,
how the hell can she be hard to get?

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:26.500
Spangler, get us a drink, quickly.
Then she upsets Fitch in some way.

01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:29.510
- (Patricia) Fitch is a pig.
- Fitch has got manners.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.710
He was like a bear with a sore head.
Did you piss in his pants?

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:36.800
Then she's giggling like a virgin
playing with a candle.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:41.890
You'll have to make it up to him.
He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.770
- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:49.150
He'll remember.
Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.570
I'm not going with him.
He sweats and stinks and he can't make it.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.120
- Shut your whore up, Cory.
- Like Georgie?

01:11:56.210 --> 01:11:59.540
- Shut up!
- She's a fine woman. She's never let me down.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:02.160
- You must be joking.
- Shut up, Pat!

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:05.040
- She's upset.
- What do you mean, I must be joking?

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.050
- Here. Get rid of her.
- Don't do that to a woman.

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:11.340
- I do what I like to a woman.
- That's your trouble.

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:15.590
No wonder Georgie looks like she does
and hates your guts.

01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.970
- What are you talking about?
- No wonder she screws around.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:22.760
- You what?
- You're so bloody blind, you'd never notice.

01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:25.690
- Shut up! She's raving.
- I'm not. I saw them.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.820
- Who?
- Georgie and that Jew.

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:31.690
- What Jew?
- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:35.730
Haven't you noticed?
They always go off to the john together.

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:40.540
- You what?
- Why do you think Georgie's always in the john?

01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.540
You blind bat.
She doesn't have the shits every five minutes.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.460
Shit!

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.340
(Patricia cries)

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:57.170
Shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Quiet.

01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:59.310
Shh. Shh.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.140
Shh.

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.030
(Patricia sobbing)

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:28.290
I'm going to the loo.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.750
(Gasping, screaming)

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:39.550
Georgina!

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.680
Georgina!

01:13:44.610 --> 01:13:47.940
Georgina, where are you, you bitch? Georgina!

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:52.560
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Get out, you bitch. Georgina!

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:54.690
Where are you? Get out!

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.900
- (Screaming)
- Go on, get out!

01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:59.200
Where are you?

01:13:59.290 --> 01:14:03.150
- No, please!
- Get out of here! Get out, you...

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:07.330
Please, no! Please, no!

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.120
- Go on! Georgie!
- Please, no.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:12.630
Where are you, Georgie?

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.260
(Coughing, retching)

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:20.390
(Flies buzzing)

01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:31.270
- (Shouting, pots clattering)
- (Whispering) It's over. He has found out.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.060
- (Albert) Georgina? Georgina!
- (Falling cutlery)

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:37.480
- (Banging)
- Georgina!

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:40.660
- Georgie! You get out.
- (Woman screams)

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.400
(Crashing)

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.370
I'll get him to leave.

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:49.410
- Richard, don't get into trouble over me.
- Georgie!

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.540
(Woman screaming)

01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:55.080
- Let's go and face him.
- Don't be mad. He'll kill you!

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.500
Come quickly. Come with me.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:06.600
- Wait here five minutes.
- (Michael) We'll freeze to death.

01:15:06.690 --> 01:15:11.100
He will never look in here.
Only five minutes. I will get your clothes.

01:15:11.190 --> 01:15:14.530
(Albert, distant) Georgie, where are you?

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:20.730
- Georgina! Georgie, where are you?
- (Glass smashing)

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.980
Georgie. Georgie.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.160
You! Where is she? Where's my wife?

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:30.580
- What's the matter?
- You know. Fetching her cigarettes.

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.590
- Where's my wife?
- (Richard) Your wife is your affair.

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.420
This is not a lost property office.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:38.960
I want my wife! Where is she?

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:42.920
You! You stupid little rat.
Where's my wife? Where is she?

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:47.390
If you have finished,
I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:51.560
- I have other diners to consider.
- Oh! Uh!

01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:55.480
I'm the only diner who matters here.
I own this restaurant.

01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:58.770
I want my wife. You've hidden her. Where is she?

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.150
God keep me calm! Where are they?

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.360
Georgina! Georgina!

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:09.290
- Georgina! Georgina!
- Ahh!

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:13.210
Georgina! Where is she, Boarst?

01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:20.800
Boarst, where is she? Georgie! Georgie!

01:16:21.930 --> 01:16:24.600
Georgie, you bitch!

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.350
(lnspector) Hard around.

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.480
(Dogs barking)

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:35.520
Georgie! I want my wife!

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.280
(Screaming)

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.740
(Albert) Georgie!

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.080
I'll bloody find her.

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:54.710
I'll bloody find her.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.000
I'll find them. I'll bloody find them.
I knew it. Scheming tart!

01:17:00.090 --> 01:17:02.840
I'll bloody find them and I'll bloody kill him!

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:04.970
And I'll bloody eat him!

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.810
I'll kill him and I'll eat him!

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.640
- I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.
- (Georgina) Oh, shit!

01:17:12.730 --> 01:17:15.850
- (Police radio)
- I'll eat him!

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:19.320
I'll eat him!

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.400
We can get you out.
Eden can drive you. Where do you want to go?

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.700
I know a place.

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:30.530
- What about our clothes?
- I'll get them to you. Quickly.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.710
Quickly. Quick.

01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:55.230
No. No. No, no.

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:58.400
No, please. Aah! No.

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:06.030
(Flies buzzing)

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.240
(Georgina sobbing)

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:22.050
(Georgina gasping)

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.290
(Creaking)

01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:41.950
What is this place?

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:45.050
It's a book depository.

01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:49.130
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:53.760
I'm cataloguing French history.

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.140
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.360
It's a bit primitive but there's an extraordinary view.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:06.820
Have you read all these books?

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.030
No.

01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:14.900
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.160
With a job like this, you could be very boring.

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.790
Are we safe here?

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.420
Does Albert read?

01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:29.550
No.

01:20:32.220 --> 01:20:34.970
If you don't read, does that make you safe?

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:37.260
Only from bad books.

01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:42.150
You could spend a lifetime in here reading.

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:48.770
You could. Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.400
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:00.620
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:03.540
How can they make you happy?

01:21:03.630 --> 01:21:06.500
I've always found them very reasonable.

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:09.870
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:12.670
That sounds like a disadvantage to me.

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.300
Kiss me.

01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:22.340
Wash me thoroughly

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.810
From my iniquity

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:29.020
And blot out....

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:32.350
- I...
- Blot out...

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:34.320
- I think perhaps...
- My...?

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:37.910
I think perhaps we'll leave the singing.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.080
Do you agree, until later, maybe?

01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:47.700
How is the restaurant?

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:52.090
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr Boarst?

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.420
He's fine.

01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.050
Is there any more trouble,

01:21:59.890 --> 01:22:02.130
er, like last night?

01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:05.010
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:12.430
No, thank you. I'll eat later with Mr Boarst.

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.790
Enjoy your meal.

01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:30.920
Thank you.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:41.260
Erm, have you any other news to tell us?

01:22:42.230 --> 01:22:47.850
Mr Boarst says... He told me to tell you to stay put

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.610
and he wishes you bon appétit.

01:22:51.690 --> 01:22:53.730
Thank you.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.620
When you're finished, I'm to take the dishes back.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:11.950
Oh, if you find any of those books interesting,
you can borrow them.

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:46.030
Wa-woo! Di-di-di-di-dah-da!

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.080
(Dogs barking)

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.760
All right, where are they? Where are they?

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.430
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:07.260
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:11.680
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:14.230
What else we got in here? Aha.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.940
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Chocolate sauce - profiteroles.

01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:21.070
Georgina liked profiteroles.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:25.990
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.950
And a nice bottle of wine. Very nice.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.130
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:36.710
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:42.170
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Come on, open it.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:46.010
- Take an interest in your food.
- (Mews) We don't need to do this.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.520
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:53.600
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:59.200
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:04.780
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:08.200
OK, button eater, tell me where they are.

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.330
(Screaming)

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:14.580
OK, button eater, where are they?

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.130
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:23.630
It's your belly button.
How'd you like to swallow that?

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.960
- Albert!
- You still here?

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:28.930
- (Shrieking)
- Well, then, watch this.

01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:41.690
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:43.820
Wake him up!

01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:46.860
Wake him up!

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:52.790
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.000
(Albert laughs) I got 'em!

01:26:48.430 --> 01:26:50.640
I have brought your dinner.

01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:01.680
(Whispers) Where's the kitchen lad?

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.560
- He is in hospital.
- What?

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:13.660
He said he told them nothing and I believe him.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:17.960
- I must see him.
- (Richard) I don't think that's wise.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.080
I'm coming.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.490
You must take me to him.

01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:26.960
- Start packing.
- (Michael) What have we got to pack?

01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:31.640
Richard. Richard, bring that for Pup.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:35.310
What can you do? You only endanger yourself.

01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:39.180
I'll only be gone an hour.

01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:42.480
Richard, you can bring me back, can't you?

01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:48.150
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.280
(Sobs)

01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:58.110
Leave me something to eat.

01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.280
Of course.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.130
Please be very careful.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.720
(Front door closes)

01:28:31.330 --> 01:28:38.370
(Pup) Have mercy upon me

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:46.490
Have mercy upon me

01:28:48.050 --> 01:28:54.850
Blot out my transgressions

01:28:56.230 --> 01:29:02.970
Blot out my transgressions

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:11.060
Purge me with hyssop....

01:29:13.530 --> 01:29:15.570
Thank you.

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:26.300
Wash me, wash me

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:34.040
And I shall be whiter than snow....

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.230
- Hold him by his hair.
- (Choking, gagging)

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:47.470
(Mitchel) He hasn't got much hair to hold.

01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:51.270
- Disgusting to be that old and to be her lover.
- (Mews) Same age as you.

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.070
- I'm her husband, not her lover.
- You can only be one and not the other?

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:02.780
If he'd been younger, I could've understood.
He'd just be a passing fancy. You bastard!

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:07.000
Right, Mitchel, now's your chance.
You are gonna chew bollocks.

01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:09.760
- (Mitchel) He's too old.
- What's that mean?

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.630
He's the same age as me - 40, almost.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.720
If he was younger it would've been all right?

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.930
My God. When you're 17, is being 40 old?

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:26.930
- (Mitchel) He probably hasn't had a bath recently.
- (Laughs) God, Mitchel, you are a prize mule.

01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.520
Well, I mean, certainly...

01:30:30.610 --> 01:30:34.440
- He must've been with Georgina last night.
- No! Shut up.

01:30:34.530 --> 01:30:37.240
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:39.700
You pissing little worm.

01:30:41.620 --> 01:30:43.860
God, you are an idiot, Mitchel.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.250
You can be guaranteed
to say the wrong thing at the right time.

01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:52.800
I didn't mean that you literally
had to chew his bollocks off.

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:55.750
I meant it metaphorically.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.000
What does that mean, Albert?

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.510
"Jewish Book-keeper Savaged
By Young Sex Maniac."

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.220
- (Michael choking)
- I don't want this to look like a sex murder.

01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:10.600
It's a revenge killing, an affair of the heart,
a crime passionnel.

01:31:10.690 --> 01:31:14.230
- I want no evil gossip spread around about me.
- (Gurgling cries)

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:19.990
They are not going to say... They are going
to say this was a dignified revenge killing.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.200
They're gonna admire the style.

01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:26.450
"He was stuffed. And Albert liked good food."

01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:30.950
They might even smile.
"He was stuffed with the tools of his trade."

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:36.870
"He was stuffed with books.
The crummy little book-keeper was..."

01:31:36.970 --> 01:31:41.760
Mitchel, no unnecessary... No unnecessaries.

01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:48.230
Finish him off! Shut his mouth, hold his nose,
ram the bloody books down his throat.

01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:50.800
Suffocate the bastard!

01:31:57.990 --> 01:32:00.150
(Georgina) Michael!

01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:11.620
Michael.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:39.530
OK, so this is how you eat the crayfish.
First, you snap off the head.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:40.810
(Crunching)

01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:42.980
Then you pull out the whiskers,

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.400
then you strip off the legs.

01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:54.290
And then you poke out the soft part of the body.

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:58.080
- You turn the light out?
- (Mitchel) What light?

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:03.550
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:08.300
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:10.220
I want Georgina to see it.

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.120
What did he say?

01:34:15.210 --> 01:34:19.420
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:23.260
Napoleon was a prat. He threw everything away.

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:28.720
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.

01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:32.140
It's amazing, isn't it? Churchill liked seafood.

01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:36.140
All the great generals were keen on seafood.

01:34:36.230 --> 01:34:39.270
What did Julius Caesar like, or Hitler?

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.730
Hitler liked clams. And Mussolini liked squid.

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:45.660
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:49.160
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:53.490
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:13.060
(Sighs)

01:35:13.810 --> 01:35:15.890
I'm so tired.

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.110
I'm going to sleep.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I've got a lot to tell you in the morning.

01:35:40.170 --> 01:35:42.410
And I want you to listen.

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:48.010
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:54.810
And then...

01:35:59.150 --> 01:36:01.470
when I wake up in the morning,

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.020
I want you to kiss me.

01:36:12.450 --> 01:36:14.780
And then I want breakfast.

01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:19.660
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls and butter

01:36:22.210 --> 01:36:24.370
and marmalade.

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:28.590
And toast.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.920
And...

01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:36.130
Good night, Michael.

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.890
I'll see you in the morning.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.400
I love you.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:55.490
- You shouldn't have done it. It wasn't worth it.
- You what?

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:59.960
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.790
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.920
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:13.250
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Calm down.

01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:18.770
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

01:37:18.850 --> 01:37:23.150
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:27.060
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:29.690
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:33.280
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.410
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:40.450
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Calm down.

01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:44.160
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:47.840
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.840
I own this restaurant. Get out! Fuck you!

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:57.800
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

01:37:57.890 --> 01:38:01.760
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:07.280
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.520
I think not, Mr Spica!

01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:15.120
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:20.410
Now, if you'd kindly leave,
we can start clearing up the mess you have made.

01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:25.570
I'm warning you. Tomorrow
your restaurant will be just one big car park.

01:38:25.670 --> 01:38:28.210
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.460
A bulldozer, Richard.
Your cuisine will be 20 feet under brick dust.

01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:36.970
Get out of it, Harris. You get out of it.

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:41.050
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.240
Well, Michael,

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.670
you didn't kiss me

01:39:14.890 --> 01:39:16.920
so...

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:22.470
I suppose I have to make my own breakfast.

01:39:25.690 --> 01:39:27.850
Don't get up yet.

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:46.370
Well, Michael,

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.500
that's that.

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.380
Short and very sweet.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.930
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:10.060
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:12.770
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:20.110
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:32.000
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.590
He was regular in his habits.

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.760
When we got back from the restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

01:40:44.850 --> 01:40:47.140
and accompany him to the toilet.

01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:51.560
And I'd have to wipe his...

01:40:55.780 --> 01:40:58.940
After I finished, he... he made... Oh...

01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:05.610
Help me, Michael.

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:14.250
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:16.540
Er, a toothbrush,

01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.580
a wooden spoon,

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.340
a plastic train,

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:29.720
a wine bottle.

01:41:29.810 --> 01:41:32.020
And he'd use them.

01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:38.480
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:43.280
At least when I did it, it hurt less.

01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:50.780
I don't think he was very interested in sex -
not with me, not with women.

01:41:55.050 --> 01:41:57.250
I left him four times.

01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:01.420
I caught the night ferry.

01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:07.970
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:12.550
On the boat, Albert cried, bought me presents.

01:42:14.730 --> 01:42:19.480
But then after we landed,
when we gotjust outside the harbour,

01:42:19.570 --> 01:42:22.360
before the motorway, he stopped the car

01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:27.490
and he and Harris and Spangler dragged me out
and stripped me and beat me.

01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:35.830
'Michael,

01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:40.380
'all this must finish.

01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:45.550
'Help me, Michael. Please.'

01:42:53.020 --> 01:42:55.140
He's dead.

01:42:57.690 --> 01:43:02.900
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favourite book.

01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:05.990
- Could you cook him?
- Cook who, Georgina?

01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:09.530
Michael.

01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:12.410
No. Mon dieu, non.

01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:20.250
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:25.130
He might taste good.

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.460
I'm sure he would taste good.

01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:30.010
What would taste best?

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:33.350
His heart? His liver?

01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.190
The cheeks of his backside?

01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:39.720
(Laughs) His prairie oysters?

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.480
Georgina,

01:43:44.570 --> 01:43:46.650
sit down.

01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:50.030
Sit down.

01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:56.290
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:02.290
I charge a lot for anything black.

01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:06.540
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:12.630
People like to remind themselves of death,

01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.470
eating black food is like consuming death,

01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:25.400
like saying, "Death, I'm eating you."

01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:29.730
Black truffles are the most expensive. And caviar.

01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:34.120
Death and birth.

01:44:35.410 --> 01:44:38.250
The end and the beginning.

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:44.750
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.920
We also charge for vanity.

01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:55.020
Diet foods have an additional surcharge

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.840
of 30º/..

01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:02.650
Aphrodisiacs, 50º/..

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:07.890
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:12.690
What did you see? I want to know.

01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:15.910
Nobody knew but you.

01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:20.370
Everyone pitied me. Even you pitied me.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:24.370
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:30.920
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:34.130
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:40.390
What I saw was what you let me see.

01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:45.020
Of course it was.

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:50.570
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:55.160
Tell me what you saw.

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.490
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:04.530
No.

01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:07.000
I saw him kissing you

01:46:09.130 --> 01:46:11.260
on the mouth,

01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:15.550
on the neck,

01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:18.550
behind your ear.

01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:24.720
I saw him undressing you.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.650
I saw him kissing your breasts.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:39.440
I saw him put his hand between your legs.

01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:44.250
And what did you see me do?

01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:50.120
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.850
I saw you lying under him on the floor of the pantry.

01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:05.600
I saw him take you from behind.

01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:14.110
I saw you take his penis in your mouth.

01:47:17.370 --> 01:47:19.740
I saw you...

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:39.470
Do lovers always behave like that?

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:47.560
My parents behaved like that.

01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:49.690
They did?

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:54.240
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.440
No, that doesn't count.

01:47:56.530 --> 01:48:01.490
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:04.370
Were you jealous?

01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:06.660
Did we make you jealous?

01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:10.170
Did you want to join us?

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:14.880
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:20.340
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:23.100
No.

01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:27.310
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:29.440
Georgina, no!

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:33.020
People I like learn my name too late.

01:48:34.530 --> 01:48:36.770
Too late?

01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:40.200
Cook Michael for me.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.320
No.

01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:46.080
This was his favourite restaurant.

01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:49.210
It's also mine.

01:48:50.210 --> 01:48:52.370
Cook Michael for me.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.750
If I did,

01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:59.840
who would ever eat here again?

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:06.390
How can I make you change your mind?

01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:13.640
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:19.690
How can I persuade you?

01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:22.860
You can't. You may have loved him...

01:49:22.950 --> 01:49:25.530
You know I did, you saw me.

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.160
But you don't have to eat him, Georgina.

01:49:30.250 --> 01:49:35.000
Do you... do you have some idea
that by eating him

01:49:35.090 --> 01:49:37.540
he can become part of you?

01:49:37.630 --> 01:49:42.130
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

01:49:43.100 --> 01:49:45.300
I'm not eating him.

01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:51.390
- Albert is.
- Albert?

01:49:56.190 --> 01:49:58.730
There's £11,000. It's Michael's.

01:50:06.290 --> 01:50:08.530
Put your money away.

01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:17.500
Where is he?

01:50:29.230 --> 01:50:31.350
(Georgina moaning)

01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.000
(Georgina crying)

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.680
(Hollow banging)

01:51:59.270 --> 01:52:01.350
(Banging on glass)

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:05.400
What's going on here?

01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:09.700
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:11.940
Special invitations.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.410
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:19.210
I have to bang on the door like an outcast.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.040
Well, well, well.

01:52:23.130 --> 01:52:28.260
Georgina Duckles.
What brings you here, you bitch?

01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:32.720
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:36.680
Where you been? Albert has been frantic.

01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:39.390
Shut up, Grace. Find me a drink.

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:43.730
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:47.440
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

01:52:47.530 --> 01:52:49.690
I'll make you pay, you slut.

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:53.400
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:58.830
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.630
There's going to be no more books
or prick- sniffing for you, girl.

01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:07.500
Happy anniversary, Albert.

01:53:07.590 --> 01:53:11.430
What are you talking about? It's not my birthday.

01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:18.130
No, but it's an anniversary that I shall
always celebrate, even if you won't. And you won't.

01:53:18.230 --> 01:53:22.970
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:25.770
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:29.480
- It's all over now.
- What is?

01:53:29.570 --> 01:53:32.940
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.440
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:38.620
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

01:53:38.710 --> 01:53:41.790
Where are they? The invitation says nine o'clock.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:45.500
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:49.630
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:54.930
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

01:53:55.970 --> 01:54:00.720
I tell you what. I'll try... We'll forget it, eh?

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:04.230
Eh? Come home with me.

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:08.690
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:12.910
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

01:54:12.990 --> 01:54:15.030
I've brought you a present.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:18.820
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

01:54:18.910 --> 01:54:22.660
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

01:54:22.750 --> 01:54:25.160
And Richard has cooked it for you.

01:54:26.170 --> 01:54:28.920
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

01:54:29.010 --> 01:54:31.080
Knowing how you like to eat.

01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:34.890
Knowing how you like to gorge yourself.

01:54:36.060 --> 01:54:39.310
And we've brought a few of your friends around.

01:55:45.710 --> 01:55:48.500
(Albert) What sort of party is this, Georgie?

01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:53.750
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.050
Can't I sit down, Georgina?

01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.590
No, this is Albert's special treat.

01:56:01.730 --> 01:56:07.560
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

01:56:09.570 --> 01:56:11.970
You're here to enjoy yourself.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.040
Georgie.

01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:43.720
Jesus!

01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:45.300
God.

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:53.020
(Georgina) No, it's not God, Albert. It's Michael.

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.780
My lover.

01:56:57.780 --> 01:57:00.870
You vowed you would kill him, and you did.

01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:05.240
And you vowed you would eat him.

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.280
Now eat him.

01:57:11.170 --> 01:57:13.330
What's the matter?

01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:17.170
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:21.680
Or have all those carefully-learnt table manners
gone to waste?

01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:35.440
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

01:57:38.570 --> 01:57:40.700
(Mitchel whimpers)

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:45.570
Your waiter has opted out.

01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:48.620
Er, Grace will pour for you.

01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:50.750
Oh.

01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.210
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

01:58:14.690 --> 01:58:17.230
Eat, Albert.

01:58:18.570 --> 01:58:20.980
Roy, pour Albert a drink.

01:58:57.860 --> 01:59:02.520
Try the cock, Albert. It's a delicacy.

01:59:03.450 --> 01:59:05.860
And you know where it's been.

01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:11.450
(Grunting)

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:44.400
(Georgina) Go on, Albert.

01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:47.410
Eat.

02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:07.340
Bon appétit.

02:00:09.770 --> 02:00:11.890
It's French.

02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:41.080
Cannibal.

02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:51.570
English SDH
