25:07.650 --> 25:08.850
I want to check something.

25:08.885 --> 25:10.819
[Electronic beeping]

25:10.853 --> 25:12.554
Anna.

25:12.589 --> 25:14.456
- Maybe you're right.
- Yeah, I know.

25:14.490 --> 25:16.492
But count to ten,
'cause I wanna check this.

25:16.526 --> 25:19.628
It could be something else.

25:19.663 --> 25:20.730
Never mind.

25:21.865 --> 25:23.933
Gary...

25:23.967 --> 25:25.868
Hi, um...

25:25.902 --> 25:27.570
I need to take Gary with me.

25:27.604 --> 25:28.638
Rosen wants us back.

25:28.672 --> 25:30.606
Yeah, I want to stay.

25:30.641 --> 25:32.875
Wasn't an offer, Gary.

25:32.910 --> 25:34.543
Well, I'm not leaving.

25:34.578 --> 25:37.113
No...You're going.
We both are.

25:37.147 --> 25:39.214
Uh...No.
No, I'm staying.

25:39.248 --> 25:41.217
Hey, Gary,
just get in the car now.

25:41.251 --> 25:44.720
- Hey! Don't try and push me.
- Excuse me?

25:44.754 --> 25:46.755
You're trying to push me,
and it doesn't work on me.

25:46.790 --> 25:48.724
No, I know it doesn't work,
and I wasn't.

25:48.758 --> 25:49.792
So what's eating you?

25:49.826 --> 25:51.527
Ha! That's
a stupid question.

25:51.561 --> 25:52.661
Nothing's eating me.

25:52.696 --> 25:53.696
I'm not leaving.

25:53.730 --> 25:54.897
Okay, big shot.

25:54.931 --> 25:56.231
Well, who's gonna
take you back?

25:56.266 --> 25:58.567
I am--the big shot
will drive himself back.

25:58.601 --> 26:00.669
Or I'll call a cab,
since I don't have a car.

26:00.703 --> 26:01.971
Gary, I don't have time
for this.

26:02.005 --> 26:04.940
Just get in the car now.

26:04.975 --> 26:06.408
I'm not leaving!

26:06.443 --> 26:08.744
I'm not a big shot.
I'm an adult.

26:08.778 --> 26:10.412
And I don't have
to do what you say.

26:10.447 --> 26:12.081
It's the end
of the conversation.

26:12.115 --> 26:13.749
Okay.

26:33.902 --> 26:36.671
My C.O., guy used to say,

26:36.705 --> 26:38.472
never let the fight
get personal.

26:38.506 --> 26:40.040
Well, they tried
to kill me, Cameron.

26:40.074 --> 26:42.376
It doesn't get more personal.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.910
Don't you want
to know why?

26:43.945 --> 26:46.480
I know why.
I stood in their way.

26:46.514 --> 26:48.081
Apparently,
Red Flag doesn't need

26:48.115 --> 26:49.582
any more justification
than that.

26:49.616 --> 26:51.917
Okay.

26:51.952 --> 26:54.753
You know, you make things
personal, you get emotional.

26:54.788 --> 26:56.755
You get emotional,
you make mistakes

26:56.789 --> 26:58.357
and you overlook stuff.

26:58.391 --> 27:00.359
I seem to remember
someone telling me that

27:00.393 --> 27:01.393
about my Alpha skill.

27:01.427 --> 27:02.861
[Chuckles] Don't be cute.

27:02.896 --> 27:05.230
Uhh, okay.

27:05.264 --> 27:08.433
You wanna catch this guy.
I get it.

27:08.467 --> 27:10.401
Just let him be the one
that makes the mistakes.

27:21.481 --> 27:23.149
I'm glad you stood up
for yourself.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.118
I'm glad you stayed here
with me.

27:25.152 --> 27:26.720
I like you, Gary.

27:26.754 --> 27:29.390
Then why did you lie to me?

27:31.360 --> 27:34.061
I knew that there was
something weird about the date.

27:34.095 --> 27:36.563
'Cause a 10 was a 20.

27:36.598 --> 27:38.398
And you--you didn't
want to explain.

27:38.432 --> 27:41.301
So I went back
through the messages.

27:41.335 --> 27:43.903
And if I thought that a two
was a one,

27:43.937 --> 27:45.304
then the first code
that you gave me

27:45.339 --> 27:46.872
was wrong.

27:46.907 --> 27:48.474
And that's why
the truck was empty.

27:48.508 --> 27:51.309
And you don't make mistakes
with that.

27:51.344 --> 27:53.111
'Cause that's
your Alpha skill.

27:53.145 --> 27:55.080
You gave me the wrong number
on purpose.

27:55.114 --> 27:58.183
But that was smart.
You were smart.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.152
Because if you just
made something up,

28:00.187 --> 28:01.454
I would have known.

28:01.488 --> 28:02.922
So you made it close,

28:02.957 --> 28:04.124
and you changed the number

28:04.158 --> 28:05.859
so that we wouldn't
find the real truck.

28:08.496 --> 28:09.530
I know you did,
because

28:09.564 --> 28:11.465
they weren't making you
do anything.

28:12.968 --> 28:15.303
You work for them, Anna.

28:15.337 --> 28:16.437
You work for Red Flag.

28:16.472 --> 28:17.772
[Humming]

28:17.807 --> 28:20.375
No, Gary,
I don't work for them.

28:20.409 --> 28:23.078
They work for me.

28:30.653 --> 28:32.454
This is really bugging me.
This doesn't make any sense.

28:32.489 --> 28:35.157
Okay, so we're assuming...

28:35.191 --> 28:37.125
That Red Flag
ditched their plan, right?

28:37.159 --> 28:38.560
But did...

28:42.898 --> 28:45.032
You know she can smell your
hands were on that, right?

28:45.066 --> 28:46.100
No.

28:46.134 --> 28:48.035
She's gonna smell that
your nasty hands

28:48.069 --> 28:49.336
were on that thing.

28:49.370 --> 28:51.171
Anyway, we're assuming
that Red Flag

28:51.205 --> 28:52.406
ditched the plan, right?

28:52.440 --> 28:55.342
But the driver finished
his route in Pennsylvania,

28:55.376 --> 28:56.610
which means that
the truck was empty

28:56.644 --> 28:58.878
by the time
we got to the road.

28:58.913 --> 29:00.913
So then the question is,
why would Red Flag plan

29:00.948 --> 29:02.348
to go after a truck
with no fuel in it?

29:02.382 --> 29:03.482
Exactly.

29:03.517 --> 29:04.750
Hmm.

29:09.188 --> 29:10.689
You know what
I would love to see?

29:10.723 --> 29:13.024
A Unicorn sliding down
a rainbow?

29:15.061 --> 29:17.062
No, I would love
to see a list

29:17.096 --> 29:19.364
of all the Northwell trucks
on the road right now

29:19.399 --> 29:20.499
with fuel in them.

29:23.870 --> 29:25.838
26-52 is on 95.

29:25.873 --> 29:28.374
- South?
- Yep, heading south.

29:28.409 --> 29:29.442
There's no way we can

29:29.476 --> 29:31.278
cover all those trucks
at once,

29:31.312 --> 29:33.113
even if I can convince someone
that I'm right.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.882
I think you're right.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.456
I write them.

29:44.490 --> 29:45.891
My friends trust me.

29:45.925 --> 29:47.325
If you were with us,

29:47.360 --> 29:48.894
we would trust you too.

29:48.928 --> 29:50.061
Huh.

29:50.096 --> 29:52.063
We would never
treat you like a child.

29:52.098 --> 29:54.099
Yeah, well...

29:54.133 --> 29:55.768
I could figure it out.

29:55.802 --> 29:57.469
'Cause I know
the real number.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.305
So I could figure out
the plan.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.807
I'm sure you could.

30:00.841 --> 30:01.975
Yeah, I could, but...

30:02.009 --> 30:03.310
It'd be better
if you just told me

30:03.344 --> 30:04.511
where they were going.

30:04.545 --> 30:07.548
Anna, I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

30:07.582 --> 30:10.218
If you were my friend,
then you'd tell me.

30:11.954 --> 30:13.354
You are my friend,
and I will tell you.

30:13.389 --> 30:14.455
Okay, good.

30:14.490 --> 30:16.757
I don't want to hurt anyone,
either.

30:16.791 --> 30:19.994
But, sometimes,
we don't have a choice.

30:21.596 --> 30:24.398
There's a drug
to prevent birth defects.

30:24.432 --> 30:27.400
But lots of things are
considered birth defects.

30:27.435 --> 30:29.903
You're not answering
my question.

30:29.937 --> 30:32.571
Now, you're telling me
something else.

30:32.606 --> 30:36.008
Alphas--that's the word
Dr. Rosen used, right?

30:36.043 --> 30:38.077
Women who take this drug
won't give birth

30:38.111 --> 30:39.846
to any more Alphas.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.614
But why would they do that?

30:41.649 --> 30:44.851
That doesn't make any sense.

30:44.886 --> 30:48.155
Society can't deal with
people like us.

30:48.189 --> 30:50.457
We need to send
a message to them.

30:50.491 --> 30:52.526
We are not a problem
to be fixed.

30:55.163 --> 30:58.665
Make a choice
for yourself, Gary.

30:58.699 --> 31:01.501
All you have to do
is say nothing.

31:28.751 --> 31:31.186
You haven't answered me.

31:31.187 --> 31:33.189
What are you going to do?

31:34.959 --> 31:37.060
I never made
my own friends.

31:37.094 --> 31:39.596
I--I know people.

31:39.630 --> 31:43.233
And they say that
they're my friends, but...

31:43.267 --> 31:44.568
I didn't meet them,

31:44.602 --> 31:47.404
like how I met you, Anna.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.672
I know, Gary.

31:48.707 --> 31:52.275
Yeah, so...
Are you really my friend?

31:52.310 --> 31:53.843
Or...were you just
pretending

31:53.878 --> 31:56.146
so that I'd send them
the wrong information?

31:58.482 --> 31:59.716
Okay, good.

31:59.750 --> 32:02.785
'Cause I just--
I did something.

32:02.819 --> 32:05.220
Sneaky.

32:05.255 --> 32:07.356
And...I don't think
that you're gonna like it.

32:10.860 --> 32:12.527
Sullivan,
look, I'm not saying

32:12.562 --> 32:13.862
it won't cause panic.

32:13.897 --> 32:15.364
You know, maybe it will
cause panic.

32:15.399 --> 32:17.032
But you tell me,
what other choice do we have?

32:17.067 --> 32:18.134
Bill...

32:18.168 --> 32:19.402
No, tell me!

32:19.436 --> 32:21.837
Look, you could send
20 squad cars to Manhattan

32:21.872 --> 32:22.972
to stop the ones
heading there.

32:23.007 --> 32:24.040
Bill, you need
to look at this.

32:24.074 --> 32:25.908
I'll call you back.

32:28.245 --> 32:31.381
I want him here, Nina.
We need Gary's skills.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.317
Was I unclear about that?

32:33.352 --> 32:35.486
Shouldn't you ask Gary why
he doesn't want to come back?

32:35.520 --> 32:37.155
What, you don't think
I get it?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.758
Yes, Gary has met
someone like him.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.727
It's new.
It's exciting.

32:41.761 --> 32:44.396
But that doesn't make
his behavior any less juvenile.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.331
And it doesn't make you
leaving him there--

32:46.365 --> 32:47.832
I didn't leave him there.
He wanted to stay.

32:47.867 --> 32:49.333
I'm not his mom,
and I'm not his babysitter!

32:49.368 --> 32:50.735
- Let's go.
- Trenton, New Jersey.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.003
Montclair Pharmaceuticals.

32:52.037 --> 32:53.104
What's going on?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.805
Gary found Kosar.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.609
We got a truck
loaded with fuel

32:59.644 --> 33:00.877
headed
to the Montclair plant.

33:00.911 --> 33:02.311
Now, apparently,
there's a new drug

33:02.346 --> 33:03.913
that Red Flag
wants to destroy

33:03.948 --> 33:05.215
before anyone
gets a chance to take it.

33:05.249 --> 33:06.850
I don't understand.
He texted you this?

33:06.884 --> 33:07.918
Yeah.

33:07.952 --> 33:09.253
Well, how did he get
the number wrong

33:09.287 --> 33:10.321
in the first place?

33:10.355 --> 33:11.789
Doc, it was the girl
the entire time.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.291
She is Red Flag.
The girl?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.959
Yes! She gave us
the wrong information

33:14.993 --> 33:16.461
to gave her guys
more time to move.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.462
Let's go.

33:17.497 --> 33:19.064
Gary's still there.

33:19.099 --> 33:20.933
Bill!
You and Hicks go ahead.

33:20.967 --> 33:22.234
We're gonna go get Gary.
Rachel...

33:22.268 --> 33:23.301
This is Kosar
we're talking about.

33:23.336 --> 33:24.436
Come on, this is our shot.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.904
I know. Go get him.

33:25.938 --> 33:27.572
Let's go!

33:27.607 --> 33:29.374
- Come on.
- Let's go, let's go.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.776
I'm sorry
that I had to do it.

33:31.811 --> 33:34.913
Anna, I had to because
your friend Kosar,

33:34.947 --> 33:37.314
he tried to kill Dr. Rosen,
and that's wrong.

33:37.349 --> 33:38.315
[Humming]

33:38.350 --> 33:39.983
Rosen isn't like us.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.218
He's not an Alpha.

33:41.252 --> 33:43.320
No, he's not,
but he is my friend.

33:43.354 --> 33:45.422
Anna, you don't have
to worry, okay?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.925
I'm gonna make sure that
nothing bad happens to you.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.495
Dr. Rosen's
gonna help you now.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.798
Like how he's helped me.

33:52.832 --> 33:54.433
I don't need his help.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.434
And neither do you.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.703
I hope someday
you'll see that.

33:57.738 --> 33:58.704
No...

33:58.739 --> 34:00.840
[Static humming, buzzing]

34:03.177 --> 34:04.577
What is that?

34:04.611 --> 34:05.845
Who's coming?

34:08.947 --> 34:11.315
Anna, what did you send?

34:16.021 --> 34:17.655
Aah! Aah!

34:17.688 --> 34:19.089
Ow! Ow!

34:19.123 --> 34:20.824
Ow! Ah!

34:20.858 --> 34:22.425
Aah! Aah!

34:22.460 --> 34:25.462
[Screaming]

34:49.989 --> 34:51.822
They're coming.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.012
It's through the gate.

35:17.450 --> 35:19.050
All right,
it's the R and D building

35:19.085 --> 35:20.985
on the southeast corner
of the campus.

35:21.020 --> 35:23.221
That is the target.
Evacuate immediately.

35:40.439 --> 35:41.406
Okay, take the wheel.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.542
- What?
- Take the wheel!

35:48.814 --> 35:50.448
We can't wait
for the timer!

35:50.482 --> 35:51.949
Get it as close as you can...

35:51.984 --> 35:53.218
And then blow it!

35:58.891 --> 36:00.058
Well, where you going?

36:02.061 --> 36:03.395
Uhh!

36:10.470 --> 36:12.637
Hicks, the truck!
Don't blow it up.

36:12.672 --> 36:14.272
Thanks, Bill.
Just let me concentrate.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.078
[Electricity sizzling]

36:23.949 --> 36:25.382
Wha...

36:25.417 --> 36:27.985
- Aah!
- Hey!

36:28.019 --> 36:28.986
Hold it steady!

36:29.020 --> 36:30.454
[Tires squealing]

36:32.791 --> 36:34.958
[People screaming]

36:45.503 --> 36:47.238
- Hicks, you ready?
- I'm on it!

36:47.272 --> 36:49.741
- Freeze!
- Go get Kosar!

37:04.692 --> 37:05.792
[Gunshot]

37:09.898 --> 37:10.965
Uhh!

37:13.034 --> 37:15.035
[Whimpering]

37:20.876 --> 37:22.510
Move!

37:31.387 --> 37:33.188
[Tires screeching]

37:39.730 --> 37:42.298
[Gunshots]

37:45.035 --> 37:46.436
[Electricity sizzling]

38:01.950 --> 38:04.486
[Electricity sizzling]

38:04.520 --> 38:05.854
Uhh!

38:41.163 --> 38:42.329
Gary?

38:44.967 --> 38:48.103
Gary? Gary?

38:48.137 --> 38:50.438
Are you, uh...
Are you all right?

38:50.473 --> 38:52.107
Gary!

38:52.142 --> 38:53.943
I have a headache.

38:54.978 --> 38:56.279
Are you--are you hurt
anywhere?

38:56.313 --> 38:57.780
No.

38:57.815 --> 38:58.815
Hi, Nina.

38:58.849 --> 39:00.483
- Hey.
- Where's Anna?

39:00.517 --> 39:02.852
I don't know, Gary.
I don't know.

39:02.887 --> 39:03.987
She was gone
when we got here.

39:04.021 --> 39:05.354
Oh, I need my phone.

39:05.389 --> 39:06.689
Here, here it is.

39:06.724 --> 39:08.457
Thank you.

39:08.492 --> 39:09.625
You're okay, right?

39:09.659 --> 39:10.926
Yeah.

39:21.137 --> 39:23.105
Gary, I--
I know you liked Anna,

39:23.140 --> 39:25.008
but remember,
I'm your friend too.

39:25.042 --> 39:27.544
Yeah...I know.
But you're not one of us.

39:27.578 --> 39:29.513
You're not.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.986
Gary, I don't make
distinctions like that.

39:35.021 --> 39:38.223
Now, I don't know
what Anna told you,

39:38.258 --> 39:39.458
but I want you to remember

39:39.493 --> 39:41.761
that Red Flag is just
a small group of people

39:41.795 --> 39:43.729
with some
very extreme ideas.

39:43.763 --> 39:45.731
Yeah, I know.
You already told me that...

39:45.766 --> 39:46.866
Before.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.536
I sent you an email,
Dr. Rosen.

39:50.570 --> 39:53.004
And you should read it.

40:06.852 --> 40:08.753
You wanna test it?

40:08.787 --> 40:09.787
No.

40:09.822 --> 40:11.622
I'm not going back down.

40:11.657 --> 40:14.191
No, if it's too cold,
then I can get it myself.

40:14.226 --> 40:15.659
I can take care
of myself.

40:18.263 --> 40:19.262
Okay.

40:21.099 --> 40:22.833
Good night, mom.

40:22.867 --> 40:24.100
Good night, sweetie.

40:24.134 --> 40:25.268
I love you.

40:36.380 --> 40:37.446
[Electronic beeping]

40:37.481 --> 40:38.648
I'm sorry, Gary.

40:38.682 --> 40:41.351
I hope you are still
my friend.

40:45.890 --> 40:47.690
Hmm.

40:51.530 --> 40:52.930
[Computer voice]
The drug makers and educators

40:52.965 --> 40:54.098
have been warned.

40:54.133 --> 40:56.268
If they try to bring
this poison to market,

40:56.302 --> 40:57.369
we will act again...

40:57.403 --> 41:00.105
And we will continue
to do so

41:00.140 --> 41:02.541
until they understand
true neurodiversity

41:02.575 --> 41:05.110
cannot be limited by
their small minds.

41:05.144 --> 41:06.945
[Shuts TV off]

41:06.979 --> 41:09.113
We picked this up
over an open frequency.

41:09.148 --> 41:10.481
They didn't bother
to encode it,

41:10.516 --> 41:12.650
so I had our speech analyst
take a look.

41:12.684 --> 41:15.586
The writing matches--
- It's her, no question.

41:15.620 --> 41:19.523
Hicks warned me,
and I did not listen.

41:19.557 --> 41:23.494
I underestimated
this young woman.

41:23.529 --> 41:25.196
And not just
her ability,

41:25.231 --> 41:27.666
but the strength
of her argument as well.

41:27.700 --> 41:30.435
I'm not getting
your point, Rosen.

41:30.470 --> 41:32.004
What, are you
switching sides?

41:32.038 --> 41:34.306
No, this drug was designed
to limit the chances

41:34.341 --> 41:35.975
of brain damage in infants.

41:36.010 --> 41:37.644
If it had gone to market,
it may indeed

41:37.678 --> 41:39.712
have prevented other Alphas
from being born.

41:39.747 --> 41:41.414
I don't know that.

41:41.448 --> 41:43.516
All I know is that there's
good guys and bad guys,

41:43.550 --> 41:46.051
and today, your people
put the bad ones in the ground.

41:47.587 --> 41:48.587
Yes, they did.

41:48.621 --> 41:50.555
And I can appreciate that.

41:50.589 --> 41:53.358
I can have two conflicting
thoughts at the same time.

41:53.392 --> 41:54.659
[Chuckles]

41:54.693 --> 41:56.894
Something Don Wilson
used to say.

41:56.928 --> 41:59.129
I hardly knew the man.

41:59.163 --> 42:00.230
Fine, stay conflicted.

42:00.264 --> 42:02.933
But all this is
is a bunch of criminals

42:02.967 --> 42:05.703
who used an issue to try
to expand their reach.

42:08.273 --> 42:09.874
Maybe.

42:09.908 --> 42:13.077
I want to show you something.

42:13.111 --> 42:15.246
Rosen and I
always thought Red Flag

42:15.280 --> 42:18.582
was a loose network
of 50 to 100 affiliates.

42:20.235 --> 42:21.669
A cartel, but---

42:21.694 --> 42:23.542
When Anna flooded
Gary with messages

42:23.567 --> 42:26.100
we got quite a different picture.

42:31.199 --> 42:33.834
This more than
a criminal enterprise.

42:33.859 --> 42:37.186
This is a movement.
