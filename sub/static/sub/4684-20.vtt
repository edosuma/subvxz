WEBVTT

00:01.466 --> 00:04.666
No, no, no.
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.733 --> 00:07.633
Here's what's on my mind,
tonight.

00:10.533 --> 00:14.300
Tony Dow and Sandahl Bergman
are recovering cannibals.

00:14.366 --> 00:18.866
I promise to never again
raise my fork

00:18.933 --> 00:20.966
against my fellowmen.

00:21.033 --> 00:23.300
Who just fell off the wagon.

00:23.366 --> 00:25.600
Bet you can't
take just one bite.

00:25.666 --> 00:28.966
But this time, they bit off
more than they can chew

00:29.033 --> 00:31.033
on "Freddy's Nightmares."

00:31.100 --> 00:35.300
Where they only meet
to eat each other.

00:55.033 --> 00:57.500
You are in Springwood now.

00:57.566 --> 00:59.666
And you are all mine.

01:23.433 --> 01:24.733
'Here's the dip everyone.'

01:24.800 --> 01:26.266
'Oh, great. Thanks.'

01:26.333 --> 01:27.300
'Over here.'

01:27.366 --> 01:29.100
Hi, Tim.
You're just in time.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.366
Uh, uh, I think there's
a spot in the back.

01:32.866 --> 01:34.433
- 'Here, there's room here.'
- Watch it.

01:34.500 --> 01:35.700
- 'Oh, hey.'
- 'Hi.'

01:40.366 --> 01:42.033
Hello, and welcome.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.066
My name is Johnny and..

01:44.133 --> 01:45.100
...I'm a cannibal.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.966
Hi, Johnny.

01:48.266 --> 01:50.600
But, uh, human flesh
has not passed my lips

01:50.666 --> 01:52.066
for the past three months now.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.033
- 'Alright.'
- 'Yay!'

01:54.100 --> 01:55.600
And that's what
we're all about here.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.233
Getting by day to day.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.333
Getting by without taking
a bite of that arm or leg.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.333
And leaving our neighbors,
just as we found them. Whole.

02:04.733 --> 02:05.666
Now, um..

02:08.900 --> 02:10.533
Who took my seat?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.666
Mary, Mary Beth,
just sit down anywhere.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.600
But this is a new dress.

02:14.666 --> 02:17.233
- Mary Beth.
- God, how rude.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.966
Uh, thank you.

02:19.033 --> 02:21.566
You know, we are all here
for each other.

02:21.633 --> 02:24.200
Uh, for example, um,
just last week.

02:24.266 --> 02:27.500
Young Brian here was tempted
by his neighbors wife.

02:27.566 --> 02:29.866
He had visions of,
uh, milky white thighs

02:29.933 --> 02:31.666
and succulent breasts

02:31.733 --> 02:33.700
in a potato and leek stew.

02:33.766 --> 02:35.633
And he was weakening.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.533
But before he faltered,
he called David.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.400
And David was there for him.

02:39.466 --> 02:40.866
- David.
- Yeah.

02:43.833 --> 02:47.666
Most of you know me,
I'm Ginger and I'm a cannibal.

02:47.733 --> 02:49.900
Hi, Ginger.

02:49.966 --> 02:52.533
But it was out of survival
that I turned to human flesh.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.766
Johnny, Mary Beth and I

02:53.833 --> 02:55.766
were trapped out here
in the mountains.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.133
Our first mortal meals
were already dead.

02:59.200 --> 03:02.766
They were victims of the same
plane crash that stranded us.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.500
But then, we found
we liked it..

03:05.566 --> 03:07.066
...especially with
the right sauce.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.333
Hmm.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.966
We knew that we were addicted

03:10.033 --> 03:12.200
when normal food seemed bland

03:12.266 --> 03:14.700
and we had cravings
for the well formed man

03:14.766 --> 03:16.866
which is the most
natural of foods.

03:16.933 --> 03:19.466
But we live in
a junk food society

03:19.533 --> 03:22.966
so we must deal with
the ugly face of prejudice.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.600
And you know, I, uh, I had
to step down as a president

03:25.666 --> 03:28.833
of my corporation, because
the rumor started to spread.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.800
And Ginger here, had to move
out into this trailer

03:30.866 --> 03:34.033
out in the woods because,
uh, she was being persecuted.

03:34.100 --> 03:37.933
And just last week, Mary Beth
had her credit cards revoked.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.633
- Oh!
- Those heartless bastards.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.600
But to live in peace,
we must, uh, once again

03:43.666 --> 03:45.166
be like the others.

03:45.233 --> 03:46.833
So that is why..

03:48.600 --> 03:53.000
I promise to never again
raise my fork

03:53.066 --> 03:55.200
against my fellowman.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.500
- Alright.
- Yeah!

03:59.633 --> 04:01.900
Hey, listen. Thank you,
thank you very much for coming.

04:01.966 --> 04:03.500
Oh, and the, uh,
vegetable recipe

04:03.566 --> 04:04.600
is available on the way out.

04:04.666 --> 04:05.766
- 'Oh, yeah.'
- 'Yeah.'

04:05.833 --> 04:07.400
'I made copies for everyone.'

04:14.133 --> 04:15.900
- Take care.
- Bye.

04:15.966 --> 04:18.300
Bye-bye, guys.
Drive carefully.

04:31.900 --> 04:33.400
I've been thinking
about you, Ginger.

04:33.466 --> 04:35.400
A lot.

04:35.466 --> 04:37.400
I haven't been
with another woman, since you.

04:38.566 --> 04:40.033
What about Mary Beth?

04:41.166 --> 04:42.400
She took a vow of chastity

04:42.466 --> 04:44.000
when they revoked
her credit cards.

04:47.433 --> 04:48.733
How about you?

04:48.800 --> 04:53.000
Outside of eating them, yours
were the last arms that I felt.

05:00.666 --> 05:03.133
Not touching you is harder
than staying on the wagon and..

05:03.200 --> 05:05.433
...not tearing flesh
with my teeth.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.066
Then why torture yourself?

05:28.300 --> 05:29.500
- Hey.
- What?

05:29.566 --> 05:31.733
Help me. You gotta hide me.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.333
They're out there
and they're gonna find me.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.333
- Who?
- What?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.333
- Where?
- Why?

05:35.400 --> 05:36.933
How did you get in here?

05:37.000 --> 05:39.100
Oh, oh, it's too late.

05:40.666 --> 05:41.900
Ah!

05:53.633 --> 05:55.233
You are what you eat, babe.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.333
So..

05:57.400 --> 06:00.033
...get this recipe right.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.933
Well, you take your eggs

06:02.000 --> 06:03.600
uh, one, uh, two, uh, three.

06:03.666 --> 06:06.000
You get some flour. Hmm.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.266
A little sugar.

06:08.966 --> 06:11.066
Don't forget the butter. Yah!

06:11.133 --> 06:13.433
And you got your chopped meat.

06:15.366 --> 06:16.833
Where's my chopped meat?

06:18.400 --> 06:22.000
I said chopped meat, guys.

06:22.066 --> 06:25.333
Ah, don't worry.
Uh, I can take care of that.

06:26.866 --> 06:29.866
Wait till you see
how I serve up this guy.

06:46.533 --> 06:48.966
Bet you can't
take just one bite.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.500
You flesh addict!

06:51.266 --> 06:53.933
That's cheating.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.633
Oh, you,
you don't know how tired I'm

06:55.700 --> 06:58.400
of carrot sticks, sprouts
and-and quiche.

06:59.666 --> 07:01.833
No mas. No mas.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.833
N-no mas.

07:20.466 --> 07:21.833
We were hungry.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.233
We both had a nightmare.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.733
Me too.

07:27.066 --> 07:28.733
We're all thinking
the same thing.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.233
But we're not
going to do it.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.700
I was thinking casserole.

07:33.766 --> 07:36.200
Or a souffle.

07:36.266 --> 07:38.200
Firm, yet tender.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.966
What do you think
he was talking about?

07:41.033 --> 07:42.566
'Somebody's after him.'

07:42.633 --> 07:44.633
Maybe he did
something terrible.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.166
Maybe he's just
an innocent man.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.833
Men are never innocent.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.266
Which brings me to what
you were doing earlier tonight

07:50.333 --> 07:51.833
with your pants off.

08:08.066 --> 08:10.266
Oh, my God!
We killed him.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.000
- He was gonna kill, Johnny.
- What are we gonna do?

08:13.066 --> 08:14.600
He said people were looking
for him.

08:14.666 --> 08:16.800
If we leave him like this,
we're all gonna go to jail.

08:16.866 --> 08:19.100
They have very rough
toilet paper in prison.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.166
We gotta get rid of the body.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.533
How?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.366
Set the table.

08:25.433 --> 08:27.833
Your liver pate was really
excellent, Mary Beth.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.566
Fortunately,
he wasn't a drinker.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.966
You know,
we forgot to say grace.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.000
It's the least we could do.

08:36.633 --> 08:38.233
We thank you for this feast.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.400
We know that you forgive us

08:39.466 --> 08:40.900
for if you did not
want us to eat

08:40.966 --> 08:42.633
you would not have
made us of meat.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.633
- 'Amen.'
- Amen.

08:46.966 --> 08:49.666
This won't look good at the next
cannibals anonymous meeting.

08:49.733 --> 08:51.966
Which is why,
we won't tell anyone.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.100
Gee, Mary Beth, get with
the program, will you?

08:54.166 --> 08:55.833
You just ate a guy.

08:55.900 --> 08:56.866
We're not gonna go around
telling everybody

08:56.933 --> 08:57.866
that we're sorry.

08:57.933 --> 08:59.033
What're we gonna say
when people

08:59.100 --> 09:00.300
come around
asking questions?

09:00.366 --> 09:02.500
Nothing, we haven't
seen anybody.

09:02.566 --> 09:04.300
We'll burn his clothes
in the morning.

09:04.366 --> 09:05.800
Did you freeze,
some of that pate?

09:05.866 --> 09:07.133
Yes.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.900
And the leftover tongue
is for sandwiches tomorrow.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.900
Oh. Stealers just don't make the
playoffs if they win on Sunday.

09:23.833 --> 09:25.033
Hey, what are you doing?

09:25.100 --> 09:26.433
Oh, my God!

09:26.500 --> 09:27.933
This is the man we just ate.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.866
- Where?
- Right here, on the front page.

09:30.933 --> 09:33.100
What does it say?

09:33.166 --> 09:35.500
"Garrett Evan has escaped
from an isolated government lab

09:35.566 --> 09:37.800
"yesterday where
he was undergoing tests.

09:37.866 --> 09:39.366
Anyone seen
this man should contact.."

09:39.433 --> 09:41.133
Blah, blah, blah..
"Immediately.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.866
"Under no circumstances
should you attempt to

09:42.933 --> 09:44.600
"approach him or touch him.

09:44.666 --> 09:47.966
"Garrett Evans is believed to be
carrying a deadly yet unknown

09:48.033 --> 09:50.666
virus possibly
highly contagious."

09:59.733 --> 10:02.266
Now remember, he just came by
for directions and then he left.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.633
I just dumped all
of the left overs.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.566
That was some of my best
chopped liver pate.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.600
Hello, uh..

10:11.033 --> 10:12.633
Yes.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.633
The article in the paper.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.600
'Yes, we think so.'

10:17.666 --> 10:19.500
- We've got a live one.
- 'Put it on the scrambler.'

10:19.566 --> 10:20.700
Trace that call.

10:20.766 --> 10:22.066
Don't say anything that
might frighten them.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.900
- Stay calm.
- Anything else?

10:23.966 --> 10:26.433
For God's sake,
don't hang up on them.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.066
- What's going on?
- I'm on hold.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.766
Hold, we're standing here, dying
rotting from the inside out

10:30.833 --> 10:33.333
from some stupid disease
and you put us on hold?

10:35.166 --> 10:37.466
Listen, you
flea brained moron.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.200
How dare you treat
tax paying citizens..

10:39.266 --> 10:41.033
What?

10:41.100 --> 10:44.266
My name?
Y-you wanna know my name?

10:44.333 --> 10:46.233
Hold on.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.233
I think you should
talk to them.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.333
Hello.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.466
Yes.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.500
No, she's usually like that.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.433
Just a minute.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.000
Have you noticed any
recent sweating problem?

11:01.066 --> 11:03.500
Oh, my God! Is that
one of the symptoms?

11:03.566 --> 11:05.766
I'm gonna turn into drooling
sniveling vegetables?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.100
Get a grip, Mary Beth.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.700
She says no.

11:09.766 --> 11:11.900
Uh, yeah, we're pretty sure.

11:13.733 --> 11:16.833
He just came by to ask
directions. He seemed lost.

11:18.733 --> 11:20.700
And then, uh..

11:20.766 --> 11:21.933
He left, he left.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.833
He left.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.333
Did you eat anything
he might have touched?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.400
They...they wanna know

11:31.466 --> 11:33.400
if we ate anything
that he might've touched.

11:35.233 --> 11:36.700
A-a-ah!

11:38.800 --> 11:40.300
We may have.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.366
Yes.

11:43.433 --> 11:44.733
I understand.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.300
Ginger Morgan.

11:48.366 --> 11:49.633
Springwood trailer park, uh

11:49.700 --> 11:51.833
I'm at the back,
at the edge of the forest.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
Yes.

11:55.566 --> 11:56.833
Okay.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.933
Could you please, hurry?

12:01.633 --> 12:04.400
They're sending somebody over.

12:04.466 --> 12:06.333
What's going to happen to us?

12:06.400 --> 12:09.333
All they know now, is that
it causes personality changes.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.533
What's that noise?

12:20.266 --> 12:23.566
Mary Beth is the only one
that caught the virus.

12:23.633 --> 12:26.533
Is her personality
change permanent?

12:26.600 --> 12:28.533
I'm afraid so,
there is no known cure.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.300
She is now a compulsive cleaner.

12:32.366 --> 12:33.500
Mostly toilets.

12:33.566 --> 12:35.533
Actually she's, uh,
pretty good, pretty cheap.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.066
Mary Beth, what is it?

12:44.133 --> 12:46.333
You wouldn't let me turn into
a cleaning woman, would you?

12:46.400 --> 12:48.100
You'd kill me first,
won't you?

12:48.166 --> 12:49.466
Mary Beth,
I'm not going to kill you

12:49.533 --> 12:50.966
if you turn
into a cleaning woman.

12:51.033 --> 12:53.566
Huh, that-that virus,
if it turns into anything.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.166
That bathroom
really needs a cleaning

12:55.233 --> 12:56.866
after the meeting,
it's a mess.

12:56.933 --> 12:59.233
Did you see how she lookedr
at me, when she said that?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.033
I must be changing.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.500
It's the virus.

13:03.566 --> 13:06.100
- I've gotta get out of here.
- What's going on here?

13:06.166 --> 13:07.233
It must be indigestion.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.633
Mary Beth
you are not turning

13:08.700 --> 13:10.000
into a cleaning woman.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.833
You're the same old..

13:11.900 --> 13:13.466
Uh, same old..

13:13.533 --> 13:15.500
Princess, you always were.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.966
- Are you Ginger Morgan?
- No!

13:21.033 --> 13:24.233
Take her. She went back
for seconds and had dessert.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.066
Well, it's true
she's eats like a horse.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.100
Oh, look at that figure,
it's not natural.

13:28.166 --> 13:31.233
I barely picked up my food.
I should be okay.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.100
Best to remain inside
until we determine

13:33.166 --> 13:34.600
the extent of contamination.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.966
Contamination?

13:36.033 --> 13:37.733
Got a hot one.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.166
Don't worry.
We're professionals.

13:43.233 --> 13:45.233
- We're here to help.
- Tag her.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.266
Tag them all.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.766
Neutralize the contact radius.

13:50.833 --> 13:54.300
And order up a 917 directive
when we're gone.

13:54.366 --> 13:55.966
You mind telling us,
what's going on here?

13:56.033 --> 13:58.466
Now, if you'll just
step into these.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.900
What are these?

13:59.966 --> 14:02.800
We're gonna transport you in
order to contain the exposure.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.366
Oh, those are body bags.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.166
Now, we're on a low budget.

14:07.233 --> 14:10.000
Um, I-I think
we'll just stay here.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.766
Yeah, we feel fine.
Really.

14:12.833 --> 14:13.766
Body bags?

14:13.833 --> 14:15.933
Huh? As in dead bodies?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.066
What do you wanna think about?

14:19.366 --> 14:22.366
I suggest a 604 insertion.

14:22.433 --> 14:24.400
For once. I concur.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.866
Dr. Picard,
you're new to our team.

14:37.933 --> 14:40.800
I suggest you put in
for more suit training.

14:40.866 --> 14:43.400
You're not fully mobile yet,
let's bag them.

14:56.733 --> 14:59.666
I'm Dr. Henry Picard,
project psychologist.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.966
You've already met
Dr. Clayton Van Der Straten.

15:02.033 --> 15:03.800
'Our project director.'

15:03.866 --> 15:05.966
'Dr. Katherine Rostinskya.'

15:06.033 --> 15:07.533
'Chief bio chemist.'

15:15.466 --> 15:18.600
Um, what's going on here?
Where, where are we?

15:18.666 --> 15:19.733
You feel okay?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.200
A little imbalanced.

15:21.266 --> 15:22.600
It'll wear off quickly.

15:22.666 --> 15:25.366
You were sprayed with
a harmless nerve neutralizer.

15:25.433 --> 15:26.833
Do you have a mirror?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.566
Nothing's done
with mirrors here, ma'am.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.700
This complex is called Hazmat.

15:30.766 --> 15:33.100
Short for hazardous material.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.466
It's a bio medically pure lab

15:34.533 --> 15:37.266
designed to handle
environmental crisis.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.566
You're still in Springwood.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.433
Actually under Springwood.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.700
Five levels down.

15:42.766 --> 15:45.200
I wanna know where
we are staying.

15:45.266 --> 15:47.300
I, I'd like to freshen up.

15:47.366 --> 15:49.433
Because if we're
staying overnight

15:49.500 --> 15:52.833
I need a firm mattress
and some extra pillows.

15:52.900 --> 15:55.733
And, oh, I don't want
those little tiny soap bars.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.300
Oh, another thing..

15:57.366 --> 15:59.366
..about the room service..

16:08.933 --> 16:10.900
What happens when we have
to go to the bathroom?

16:14.866 --> 16:16.800
That's disgusting.

16:22.933 --> 16:24.500
Hey!

16:24.566 --> 16:27.733
Hey! We have a right
to know what's going on here.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.066
Should we tell them?
I'm not sure.

16:29.133 --> 16:30.333
Well, I don't think we should
tell them everything.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.433
I think he is
as possible.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.533
Alright.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.900
Very well.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.666
The man you came in
contact with...

16:38.733 --> 16:41.633
was Lieutenant Colonel
John Garrett.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.933
'Mission commander of
the secret US space lab probe.'

16:45.000 --> 16:46.566
An astronaut?

16:46.633 --> 16:48.133
'Exactly.'

16:48.200 --> 16:49.400
- You mean we--
- Mary Beth.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.633
Mary Beth.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.266
'The gentleman on your left,
is Captain R.D.Thomas.'

16:55.333 --> 16:57.600
'A renowned rocket scientist..'

16:57.666 --> 16:59.400
'...and chief mission pilot.'

16:59.466 --> 17:02.066
He's currently receiving
our best treatment.

17:02.133 --> 17:05.566
The entire space lab probe crew
was exposed to asteroid dust

17:05.633 --> 17:08.500
that carried an unknown
crystalline space dust

17:08.566 --> 17:12.100
'that appears to be
a self-regenerating organism.'

17:12.166 --> 17:14.500
'But only if it is ingested.'

17:14.566 --> 17:16.533
'Taken into
the digestive system.'

17:16.600 --> 17:19.033
Are we going
to turn into monkeys?

17:19.100 --> 17:21.700
I would know nothing like that,
it has different

17:21.766 --> 17:24.233
behavioral effects
on each individual.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.166
Then what's gonna happen to us?

17:26.233 --> 17:29.200
Well, you...sort of..

17:29.266 --> 17:30.833
Just tell us.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.833
Yeah, spit it out.
Then what?

17:58.766 --> 18:00.533
Ultimately..

18:00.600 --> 18:02.100
...something like that.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.600
Johnny! What's happening?

18:37.666 --> 18:39.066
If we're gonna die, Mary Beth

18:39.133 --> 18:40.700
I wanna do it one last time.

18:40.766 --> 18:41.966
In here?

18:42.033 --> 18:43.933
Well, it's never
gonna be perfect.

18:47.566 --> 18:49.833
What could we possibly do?

18:49.900 --> 18:51.233
Oh, I'm sure we can rub
something together

18:51.300 --> 18:52.833
to get a fire started.

18:55.133 --> 18:56.400
Is this good for you?

18:56.466 --> 18:57.633
Have we started yet?

18:57.700 --> 18:59.133
'Johnny?'

19:01.533 --> 19:04.866
We could do
a lot more over here.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.700
Johnny, where you're going

19:18.466 --> 19:20.033
Johnny, you can't do this.

19:20.100 --> 19:22.200
Why not, Mary Beth?
This is my dream.

19:22.266 --> 19:25.100
- This is my dream too.
- No, it's my dream.

19:25.166 --> 19:28.633
Like I said,
it-it's also my dream too.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.633
'What's going on here?'

19:33.266 --> 19:36.866
It seems that all three have had
exactly the same dream.

19:36.933 --> 19:40.066
A symbiotic, yet unified
experience generating

19:40.133 --> 19:43.800
from a common central
and integrated source.

19:43.866 --> 19:45.400
'That would indicate
that the organism'

19:45.466 --> 19:48.200
'has taken root in all three.'

19:48.266 --> 19:52.233
This could be a key in
unlocking it's growth pattern.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.800
What happened when Garrett
came to Ginger's trailer?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.033
It was self defense.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.800
He tried to kill Johnny.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.566
He, h-he was acting
like a mad man.

20:03.633 --> 20:06.100
Yes, yes.
That would fit the pattern.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.800
H-he, uh...tried to choke me.

20:08.866 --> 20:10.800
So we speared him.

20:10.866 --> 20:13.700
- Speared him?
- They were hanging in my wall.

20:13.766 --> 20:15.433
It's rather inventive.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.766
And he died?

20:16.833 --> 20:18.833
They speared him.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.333
Okay, so he died.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.833
- Then what?
- 'Like what?'

20:25.266 --> 20:27.133
Did he touch
any of your food?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.666
Touch your food?
Our food?

20:29.733 --> 20:31.500
Um, food?

20:31.566 --> 20:33.700
What happened to Lieutenant
Colonel Garrett's body?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.433
It was disposed of.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.533
How?

20:38.600 --> 20:40.100
In three courses.

20:41.133 --> 20:43.066
Courses?

20:43.133 --> 20:45.733
Alright. Okay, you really
wanna know what happened?

20:47.300 --> 20:48.733
We ate him.

20:49.733 --> 20:51.566
Yeah, he became dinner.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.433
What was he?
Chopped liver?

20:56.833 --> 21:01.200
Well, not exactly chopped liver,
more like uh, pate spread.

21:01.266 --> 21:03.233
And a casserole.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.866
Oh, my God!

21:06.933 --> 21:08.366
You're serious?

21:08.433 --> 21:11.000
Of course, we're serious.

21:11.066 --> 21:13.033
Why else would we be here?

21:16.500 --> 21:19.533
They ingested the organism
by devouring the host body.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.533
How do we code this
for the computer?

21:24.566 --> 21:27.700
You're despicable
and disgusting perverts.

21:27.766 --> 21:30.033
You should all die
a slow and horrible death.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.800
Uh, she'll be okay in a minute.

21:34.866 --> 21:36.933
Her brother was eaten
bycannibals.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.800
How do we know,
that the end is near?

21:38.866 --> 21:40.433
Are there any signs?

21:42.833 --> 21:45.533
What, well,
there'll be a facial tick.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.200
'And, and then a shivering.'

21:49.266 --> 21:51.466
- 'As if you're cold.'
- Oh.

21:51.533 --> 21:55.000
This is usually followed
by a brief burst of strength..

21:59.166 --> 22:01.366
...which for some reason
is accompanied by a..

22:01.433 --> 22:03.800
...a passing moment
of unusual behavior.

22:03.866 --> 22:06.100
No, I'm Spartacus.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.900
Let's see, a spurt of
sexual desire should be next.

22:15.466 --> 22:17.133
Oh, Johnny.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.333
Oh, Johnny.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.700
Beam me up, Scotty.

22:34.866 --> 22:36.366
Johnny.

22:36.433 --> 22:38.333
'That last outburst
was unexpected.'

22:39.200 --> 22:40.766
This is something different.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.200
The organism maybe mutating
to a new life form.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.533
They got, Johnny.

22:51.966 --> 22:53.933
They got, Johnny.

22:55.566 --> 22:58.033
We're very sorry
about your friend.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.100
But the good news is,
the organisms seems

23:00.166 --> 23:02.666
to have neutralized itself
in your systems.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.500
Then we're free to go?

23:04.566 --> 23:06.500
The bad news is
you know too much.

23:06.566 --> 23:08.533
We are going to re-introduce
the organism

23:08.600 --> 23:11.233
into your system
so we can study it.

23:11.300 --> 23:13.033
We've taken the liberty
of adding Johnny

23:13.100 --> 23:15.366
to a protein powder shake.

23:28.466 --> 23:29.633
Ah.

23:31.500 --> 23:34.066
Johnny, on the spot.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.766
Those poor babes..

23:35.833 --> 23:38.533
...talk about taking
a bouter.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.800
And by the way,
in case you're wondering

23:40.866 --> 23:42.866
I ate Spartacus.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.700
'Before all this happened
I had just gotten the letter'

23:56.766 --> 23:59.700
'from my old roommate
wondering what I'd been up to.'

23:59.766 --> 24:02.266
'How do you tell somebody that
you've turned to cannibalism?'

24:02.333 --> 24:05.500
'Ate an astronaut who had been
infected by some space bug.'

24:05.566 --> 24:07.766
'Got hauled off
to some space lab'

24:07.833 --> 24:10.433
where you just ingested
your fiancé

24:10.500 --> 24:12.666
who had been reduced
to powder?

24:12.733 --> 24:15.000
I used to fantasize
about eating Johnny.

24:15.066 --> 24:19.133
How I'd start with his toes
and slowly work my way up?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.233
Oh, not me,
I'd start with his ears.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.266
Those lobes always look
so tempting.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.666
Ironic, we'd end up having him
in powderized form

24:26.733 --> 24:29.133
mixed into a protein shake.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.933
Oh, how long is it been
since we ate?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.166
Why? What do you wanna do?
Go for a swim?

24:34.233 --> 24:36.600
Will you stop picking on me?
We're in this together.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.633
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

24:38.700 --> 24:39.733
What do you mean,
we both drank

24:39.800 --> 24:42.166
Johnny's remains
in those shakes.

24:42.233 --> 24:45.066
Argh! I still taste him
when I burp.

24:45.133 --> 24:47.200
He gave me
terrible indigestion.

24:47.266 --> 24:50.400
What I mean is, all three
of us ate the astronaut, right?

24:50.466 --> 24:52.433
But Johnny was the only one
who exploded.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.133
You think it's gonna be me
don't you?

24:54.200 --> 24:55.500
Always the victim, right?

24:55.566 --> 24:58.166
What makes you think,
you've led such a charmed life?

24:58.233 --> 24:59.600
Well, let me tell you
something, Ginger.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.700
If not anything else,
I'm a survivor.

25:01.766 --> 25:04.266
You don't know half of what
I've been through in my life.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.100
You know, what it's like
being pinned against

25:06.166 --> 25:07.733
a department store
cosmetics counter

25:07.800 --> 25:09.700
during a half-price sale?

25:12.066 --> 25:14.033
What was that?

25:14.100 --> 25:16.433
Oh, it's my stomach.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.500
It has been making
funny noises..

25:18.566 --> 25:20.833
...since I drank that shake.

25:20.900 --> 25:22.033
Mary Beth?

25:23.833 --> 25:25.433
Mary Beth?

25:26.966 --> 25:28.933
Johnny, where are you?

25:31.266 --> 25:32.733
In here.

25:33.700 --> 25:34.733
Oh, my God!

25:35.466 --> 25:36.966
No!

25:37.033 --> 25:39.166
I'm sorry, Mary Beth.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.933
I knew, you always loved her
more than you loved me.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.433
No, it-it wasn't my idea.
I swear.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.400
I wound up inside of you,
purely by chance.

25:47.466 --> 25:48.866
Oh, sure!

25:48.933 --> 25:51.933
Johnny, what is gonna happen
to her?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.666
Same thing
that happened to me.

25:58.733 --> 26:00.400
Beam me up, Scotty.

26:04.066 --> 26:05.300
They got Johnny.

26:06.366 --> 26:07.500
They got Johnny.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.133
Johnny, no!

26:10.200 --> 26:12.000
Mary Beth, are you alright?

26:12.066 --> 26:13.000
No.

26:13.066 --> 26:15.133
No, I'm not alright.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.433
I'm going to die.

26:17.633 --> 26:20.833
Bitch, bitch, bitch,
bitch, bitch, bitch!

26:21.666 --> 26:23.700
Nobody's ever happy.

26:23.766 --> 26:26.866
So what if her fiance
was turned into powder?

26:26.933 --> 26:29.300
So what if she had to eat him?
I-I could have made her..

26:29.366 --> 26:30.600
...powder her nose
with him or..

26:30.666 --> 26:32.400
Or snort him.

26:33.566 --> 26:36.100
A high colonic enema
would have been fun.

26:36.166 --> 26:39.333
I may be cruel, but I'm fair.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.700
But this is all
about to change.

26:42.766 --> 26:45.533
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

26:56.566 --> 26:58.566
You're infatuated
with her, aren't you?

26:58.633 --> 27:01.166
In strictly
biological terms, darling.

27:01.233 --> 27:03.633
Uh-huh, I saw the way
you were looking at her.

27:03.700 --> 27:06.333
If she weren't contaminated,
you'd be all over her.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.500
'Katherine, she is a cannibal.'

27:08.566 --> 27:10.800
Yes and you would like
nothing more than for her

27:10.866 --> 27:12.700
to sink those teeth
into you, hmm?

27:12.766 --> 27:15.200
You've been
underground too long.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.633
I hope I'm not
interrupting you, doctors.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.566
Uh, no, not at all.
What is it, Henry?

27:21.633 --> 27:24.166
I wanna go on record
expressing both my opposition to

27:24.233 --> 27:26.733
and my indignation
with your methods.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.700
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that, Henry.

27:28.766 --> 27:31.633
This isn't science
...or medicine.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.000
It's madness.

27:33.066 --> 27:36.233
Our orders are to isolate
an alien organism and prevent

27:36.300 --> 27:39.133
it's release into
the atmosphere at all costs.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.466
You've got
your blue crystals, doctor.

27:41.533 --> 27:43.900
They show no symptoms of
being consumed by the organism.

27:43.966 --> 27:46.233
There was no need
to re-expose them.

27:46.300 --> 27:47.500
You've taken
two innocent women--

27:47.566 --> 27:49.733
Innocent? They ate
one of our astronauts.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.900
In self-defense.
He tried to kill them.

27:51.966 --> 27:53.933
Enough already.
What's done is done.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.600
As head of this project

27:56.666 --> 27:59.666
I'm willing to accept all
responsibility for my actions.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.966
Now, if you don't mind..

28:02.033 --> 28:04.000
...we have work to do.

28:04.066 --> 28:06.566
'Chemical structural analysis
of organism begins'

28:06.633 --> 28:08.200
'at 07:00 hours.'

28:08.266 --> 28:09.933
'All departments
will be working.'

28:18.100 --> 28:20.766
They both maintain the exact
same level of exposure.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.133
It's as though
the second ingestion

28:22.200 --> 28:23.600
had no impact what so ever.

28:23.666 --> 28:26.000
No discernible impact.

28:26.066 --> 28:27.666
You think,
it may have already mutated

28:27.733 --> 28:29.533
to a non-infectious state?

28:29.600 --> 28:31.666
No, but we have to find
the one element that both

28:31.733 --> 28:33.833
have in common that keeps
the organism from growing.

28:43.633 --> 28:45.100
He likes you.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.633
Do I detect a note
of jealousy in your voice?

28:48.700 --> 28:50.633
Oh, don't flatter yourself

28:50.700 --> 28:52.566
Last thing on my mind is sex.

28:52.633 --> 28:54.500
What's really weird..

28:54.566 --> 28:55.700
...is that I feel the same
as you do.

28:55.766 --> 28:58.100
My sex drive is nil.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.566
Then, why are we
even talking about sex?

29:00.633 --> 29:03.000
- You brought it up.
- I brought it up?

29:03.066 --> 29:04.333
I've been celibate six months.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.500
I barely remember sex.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.366
Any luck?

29:14.433 --> 29:17.300
No, we have some interesting
early indications concerning

29:17.366 --> 29:20.433
hormones, specifically
sexual hormones

29:20.500 --> 29:22.200
as possible growth accelerators.

29:22.266 --> 29:23.633
Well, that would fit
with the brief burst

29:23.700 --> 29:26.600
of intense sexual desire,
just prior to powderization.

29:26.666 --> 29:27.933
I want to run a battery of test.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.900
Break down the components
of every chemical reaction

29:29.966 --> 29:31.466
occurring in their bodies.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.266
I could prep them now.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.333
You just can't stay away
from her, can you?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.300
She's just a specimen,
nothing more.

29:37.366 --> 29:38.666
Specimen that you keep groping.

29:38.733 --> 29:40.800
- Grope?
- Copping a cheap feel.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.666
- I was wearing my gloves.
- Uh-huh.

29:43.733 --> 29:45.900
Doesn't anybody care that
they could be reduced to powder

29:45.966 --> 29:47.933
if we don't find an antidote?

29:51.733 --> 29:54.866
'Processing on
bio culture complete.'

29:54.933 --> 29:57.233
'Results awaiting distribution
on level three.'

30:23.633 --> 30:25.600
I want you.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.666
Mary Beth, what's wrong?

30:45.266 --> 30:48.300
Don't cry for me, Argentina.

31:00.466 --> 31:02.500
Mary Beth? Mary Beth?

31:19.466 --> 31:21.266
Don't you two have work to do?

31:21.333 --> 31:24.500
We need the VSE table prepped
and ready in five minutes.

31:29.033 --> 31:30.833
I've decided
I'm leaving the project.

31:30.900 --> 31:32.200
You decided what?

31:32.266 --> 31:33.766
What you are doing here
is ethically

31:33.833 --> 31:35.633
and morally wrong
and I won't be part of it.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.233
I'm afraid, you don't
understand, Dr. Picard.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.566
Once you're involved
with the top secret

31:38.633 --> 31:40.833
Hazmat Project,
you are there.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.333
You don't simply resign,
you must stay

31:42.400 --> 31:43.900
with the project
until it's completion.

31:43.966 --> 31:46.633
We are literally locked
in this lab, Dr. Picard.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.633
That's ridiculous.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.533
There has to be
a way out of here.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.666
'Ready in here,
Dr. Van Der Straten.'

31:53.733 --> 31:54.866
On my way.

31:54.933 --> 31:56.533
We'll continue
this discussion later.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.333
You bet we will.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.433
'Biofeeding schedule is now
on office at red-blue block.'

32:14.300 --> 32:15.733
Right this way.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.533
Over on the table.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.833
What are you gonna do to me?

32:24.900 --> 32:27.933
We think you hold the key
to stopping this disease.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.433
You may find your picture in
all the history books, my dear.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.733
Oh, super. Will it be a picture
of me or a pile of blue powder?

32:33.800 --> 32:36.800
Well, so far, it looks as though
it'll be a picture of you.

32:36.866 --> 32:38.333
You've ingested
the organism twice

32:38.400 --> 32:41.300
and yet somehow it has
remained dormant in your system.

32:41.366 --> 32:43.733
Somehow, I don't think
that means that I'm free to go.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.400
Well, I'm afraid not.

32:45.466 --> 32:47.500
What it does mean
is that we have to find out

32:47.566 --> 32:49.033
what it is
that's different about you

32:49.100 --> 32:50.933
than everyone else
who's ingested the organism.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.033
Mmm-hmm.
What does that entail?

32:53.100 --> 32:56.933
Well, first, I'll have to give
you a thorough examination.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.400
Please remove your jumpsuit.

32:58.466 --> 32:59.833
I don't think so.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.366
Ma'am, I'm a doctor.

33:01.433 --> 33:02.966
I see the nude body,
all the time.

33:03.033 --> 33:04.400
It's strictly clinical to me.

33:04.466 --> 33:08.033
So, I'm a cannibal.
I eat nude bodies all the time.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.900
It is strictly dinner to me.

33:09.966 --> 33:12.300
But I'm not gonna take off
my clothes any faster than

33:12.366 --> 33:14.233
you're gonna let me
make a meal out of you.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.733
If you prefer, we could proceed
with you unconscious.

33:37.966 --> 33:39.900
Well?

33:39.966 --> 33:43.600
We, uh..
Oh, my God!

33:43.666 --> 33:45.733
We start at the top and..

33:46.766 --> 33:48.300
...and we..

33:48.366 --> 33:49.933
...work our way down.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.233
Open wide.

33:58.466 --> 34:00.500
Is there a reason,
the men are performing

34:00.566 --> 34:03.766
this examination
rather than the two of us?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.766
Why?
Don't you trust Oliver?

34:05.833 --> 34:08.100
I trust Clayton.

34:08.166 --> 34:11.300
Alright, we got the throat,
nose, ear and tear cultures.

34:11.366 --> 34:12.833
Let's move on.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.100
If you will please
remove your brassiere?

34:18.566 --> 34:20.266
Dr. Van Der Straten,
I think you need to get

34:20.333 --> 34:21.600
in the airlock right away
to change

34:21.666 --> 34:23.733
your suit.
It may be defective.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.733
No, I don't think that will be
necessary, I can always clear--

34:26.800 --> 34:28.766
'If you don't get into the
airlock right now there will be'

34:28.833 --> 34:31.300
a molecular re-arrangement
of your frontal mandible.

34:32.833 --> 34:35.233
'All clean suits must be
recycled for..'

34:35.300 --> 34:37.200
half-life readings.

34:44.966 --> 34:48.033
Katherine, you know,
I have to check every gland

34:48.100 --> 34:50.266
in her body in case
she's secreting a chemical

34:50.333 --> 34:51.700
that fights the organism.

34:51.766 --> 34:53.866
You know, you didn't
have to enjoy it so much.

34:53.933 --> 34:55.900
- I didn't enjoy that.
- Huh, yeah!

34:55.966 --> 34:58.533
The only woman
I enjoy in that way..

35:00.933 --> 35:02.700
...is you.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.666
'Oh, I want you now.'

35:12.733 --> 35:16.466
'Oh, I wanna feel your naked
body against mine.'

35:16.533 --> 35:18.366
'Oh, and for once..'

35:18.433 --> 35:21.133
I want you
to take off those gloves.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.900
We can't,
we can't do this.

35:22.966 --> 35:24.633
We have a deadly organism
to fight.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.966
We have to get,
control our own desires.

35:27.033 --> 35:28.333
Yes, okay, of course.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.866
You're right.

35:29.933 --> 35:31.200
So, what are we gonna do now?

35:31.266 --> 35:32.900
'I believe Dr. Picard'

35:32.966 --> 35:34.600
'has outlived his usefulness.'

35:34.666 --> 35:37.400
Are you suggesting
that Dr. Picard become

35:37.466 --> 35:39.900
a host for the organism?

35:39.966 --> 35:43.233
He would make a noble
sacrifice for science.

35:47.933 --> 35:50.300
Ginger? Ginger?

35:50.400 --> 35:51.466
Shh!

35:51.533 --> 35:52.733
I'm taking you
to a place where you can

35:52.800 --> 35:54.166
get some humanitarian help.

35:54.233 --> 35:56.666
Is this some kind of a joke?
You are one of them.

35:56.733 --> 35:58.633
Not for much longer.
Come on.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.533
So how do you plan on pulling
off this great escape?

36:02.600 --> 36:04.300
Aren't we locked in here?

36:04.366 --> 36:06.833
These ducts are big
enough to hold a person.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.033
Where's your suit?

36:08.100 --> 36:10.066
It's not gonna fit
in the duct.

36:10.133 --> 36:12.266
It's alright.
I'll-I'll take my chances.

36:12.333 --> 36:14.000
Ladies first.

36:27.766 --> 36:29.133
'Okay, which way?'

36:29.200 --> 36:31.866
'I don't know,
your guess is good as mine.'

36:31.933 --> 36:33.500
'Right?'

36:33.566 --> 36:35.066
'How about left?
Straight left.'

36:35.133 --> 36:36.200
'No, I think right.
Let's go right.'

36:36.266 --> 36:38.266
'Okay, right, right, okay.'

36:38.333 --> 36:40.600
'Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I can see some light.'

36:40.666 --> 36:42.633
'Some light down there.'

36:42.700 --> 36:43.900
'I think I see a grid.'

36:43.966 --> 36:45.833
- 'Oh, God.'
- 'Come this way .'

36:49.233 --> 36:51.366
'Finally.
See, I told you it was right.'

36:51.433 --> 36:53.066
'You said left.'

36:59.966 --> 37:01.166
Oh!

37:01.233 --> 37:02.233
- Damn it!
- Oh!

37:07.833 --> 37:09.233
'Oliver?'

37:09.300 --> 37:11.033
'Yeah.'

37:11.100 --> 37:13.733
Don't we risk contamination
through those air ducts?

37:13.800 --> 37:17.400
Um...no,
they don't go anywhere.

37:17.466 --> 37:19.066
'They're designed
to prevent any living thing'

37:19.133 --> 37:22.066
from coming in
or, uh...going out.

37:29.066 --> 37:31.200
To the imminent
completion of our project.

37:31.266 --> 37:33.466
- Mm-hmm.
- Here, here.

37:33.533 --> 37:35.233
Let's hope it's soon.

37:46.833 --> 37:49.100
You really went through
with it, didn't you?

37:49.166 --> 37:51.233
You put the organism
in my drink.

37:51.300 --> 37:54.300
I'm sorry, Dr. Picard,
but we needed another subject.

37:54.366 --> 37:57.733
Well, look at it this way, you
may survive like the woman has.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.200
Or turn into
a pile of blue dust.

38:00.266 --> 38:01.600
That's a possibility.

38:01.666 --> 38:02.900
But look at it this way.

38:02.966 --> 38:04.933
You will have died
for your country.

38:06.366 --> 38:08.000
I've got to get outta here

38:14.466 --> 38:16.233
"There's no place like home."

38:16.300 --> 38:17.966
"There's no place like home."

38:18.033 --> 38:20.633
"There's no place like home."

38:20.700 --> 38:22.500
'I'm afraid the organism
has progressed much more'

38:22.566 --> 38:25.000
rapidly in this host subject.

38:28.266 --> 38:30.700
Captain, the dilithium crystals
are running out.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.866
You know how to whistle,
don't you, Steve?

38:40.933 --> 38:43.433
You just put your lips
together and...blow.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.333
This part of
the organism's progression

38:46.400 --> 38:48.900
usually doesn't last
this long.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.333
They're ba-a-ack.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.900
He should be powder by now.

39:02.333 --> 39:04.933
Live from New York, it's, ah..

39:05.000 --> 39:07.100
...Saturday night.

39:55.033 --> 39:57.166
Ah, everything your body needs.

39:57.233 --> 40:00.333
But never wanted to eat.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.200
What I wouldn't give right now
for a nice juicy steak.

40:03.266 --> 40:05.566
We'll all be dinning on real
food in just a matter of days.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.800
I wish I could
share your optimism.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.700
It isn't optimism,
it's certainty.

40:09.766 --> 40:10.766
'It's only a matter
of time before the computer'

40:10.833 --> 40:11.833
'has our answer.'

40:11.900 --> 40:13.400
And if it doesn't?

40:13.466 --> 40:16.500
I have an unshakable faith
in technology.

40:16.566 --> 40:17.900
Nice legs too.

40:18.566 --> 40:20.033
Where you going?

40:20.100 --> 40:21.966
To conduct
another interview.

40:22.033 --> 40:24.000
Maybe the last chance I get.

40:29.566 --> 40:32.100
'Computer access closes
in five minutes.'

40:32.166 --> 40:35.033
'All requests must
process through level two.'

40:37.966 --> 40:39.533
I'm taking you
out of here.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.200
What?

40:41.266 --> 40:42.500
What about them?

40:42.566 --> 40:44.533
'I exposed them
to the organism.'

40:47.133 --> 40:48.666
Then why don't we
just wait till they explode?

40:48.733 --> 40:50.866
There's no telling,
if it'll ever kill them.

40:50.933 --> 40:53.733
Thank God,
it hasn't killed you yet.

40:53.800 --> 40:56.066
I still say,
we'll never make it past them.

40:56.133 --> 40:57.300
Come with me. Wait.

40:59.133 --> 41:02.133
'Level four lock down test
commences in ten minutes.'

41:05.300 --> 41:06.733
Now is our chance.

41:24.533 --> 41:25.766
'What are you doing?'

41:25.833 --> 41:27.400
She's contaminated.

41:27.466 --> 41:29.433
Get Dr. Van Der Straten.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.800
Damn the torpedoes.
Full speed ahead!

41:49.866 --> 41:52.733
'There will be no movie in the
rest area this time around.'

41:55.333 --> 41:56.300
Made it, ma!

41:56.366 --> 41:58.733
Top of the world.

42:06.833 --> 42:08.800
Good grief!

42:11.800 --> 42:14.133
You exposed 'em
to the organism.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.800
'Haven't you?'

42:15.900 --> 42:17.000
No!

42:28.333 --> 42:31.333
I'm ready
for my close up, Mr. Demille.

42:38.933 --> 42:41.533
Katherine! My love.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.366
No, don't leave me like this.

42:44.433 --> 42:46.833
No. Not me,
not me, not me..

42:56.700 --> 42:58.533
Major Feuer

42:58.600 --> 42:59.666
I can walk.

43:11.566 --> 43:13.633
- You saved our lives.
- It worked.

43:14.933 --> 43:15.933
I don't know,
how to thank you.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.866
I-it was nothing.

43:18.933 --> 43:21.400
'Dr. Van Der Straten,
this is computer central.'

43:21.466 --> 43:22.900
'We have you results.'

43:22.966 --> 43:25.066
'Your female subject
has only one distinction'

43:25.133 --> 43:26.433
'from the other victims.'

43:26.500 --> 43:28.200
'She's been celibate
for several months'

43:28.266 --> 43:29.766
'and therefore
has a very low level'

43:29.833 --> 43:32.300
'of sexual hormones
in her system.'

43:32.366 --> 43:36.133
'Our assumption is that, if her
sexual arousal level increases'

43:36.200 --> 43:38.166
'for example,
from a sudden burst of passion'

43:38.233 --> 43:40.166
'the organism could kill her.'

43:40.233 --> 43:41.700
Uh-oh.

43:51.600 --> 43:56.200
I'll eat you, my pretty
and your little dog too.

44:04.466 --> 44:06.233
'Dr. Van Der Straten.'

44:06.300 --> 44:07.933
'Did you receive my message?'

44:09.133 --> 44:11.600
'Dr. Rostinskya,
please acknowledge.'

44:12.633 --> 44:14.233
'Is there anybody there?'

44:15.333 --> 44:16.800
'Hello?'

44:18.400 --> 44:20.033
'Hello?'

44:23.800 --> 44:27.200
Tonight's all in one plate
special

44:27.266 --> 44:28.233
Mary Beth

44:28.300 --> 44:30.666
delicately seasoned with Ginger

44:30.733 --> 44:32.600
and Oliver oil.

44:33.766 --> 44:35.800
We're at Freddy's

44:35.866 --> 44:40.333
where they only meet
to eat each other.

44:47.900 --> 44:49.833
Mm-hmm.

44:51.033 --> 44:53.133
Hurry, it's going fast.
