How are things going with Isha?

03:00.388 --> 03:02.307
-She kinda likes you.
-She does.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.200
You're the dynamic duo.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.953
You guys literally have
the same physical build.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.037
It's crazy.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.710
-Hola.
-Hi, Mom. How are you?

05:10.393 --> 05:11.227
<i>How's it going?</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:30.913
<i>Do you like it that much?</i>

05:57.065 --> 06:00.109
<i>Well, clearly I'd like</i>
<i>to have you here in Miami.</i>

06:11.120 --> 06:14.707
<i>Yes. I totally understand. I get it.</i>

06:15.666 --> 06:19.712
<i>I didn't think you'd like it</i>
<i>enough to stay.</i>

06:21.923 --> 06:25.760
<i>But you know</i>
<i>that I'll always support your decisions</i>

06:25.843 --> 06:27.762
<i>and whatever makes you happy.</i>

13:11.499 --> 13:13.250
I'm gonna cry. Thank you, Keeks.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.225
You know I really love you, right?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.842
I would be crying,
but I'm gonna see you again.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.624
I love you.
