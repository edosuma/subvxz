00:01.131 --> 00:02.001
Previously onElementary...

00:03.394 --> 00:04.613
I have something called
post-concussion syndrome.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.396
Things could get worse
before they get better.

00:05.440 --> 00:09.009
Hey, uh,
my name's Michael.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.097
HOLMES: A man approached me
at a meeting yesterday.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.576
Apparently, I helped him once

00:11.620 --> 00:13.361
when I described
how integral

00:13.404 --> 00:16.190
my work was to maintaining
my sobriety.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.800
When all's said and done,
it's entirely possible

00:17.843 --> 00:20.150
I'm going to be unfit
to continue that work.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.631
Hello, Michael,
it's Sherlock Holmes.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.198
Well, I was thinking
of going to a meeting.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.026
I wondered if you'd like
to join.

00:26.069 --> 00:28.593
MICHAEL:
Yeah, how's St. Olaf's at 4:00?

00:28.637 --> 00:30.247
HOLMES:
Excellent.

00:39.343 --> 00:42.564
[men shouting orders
indistinctly]

00:54.924 --> 00:57.579
Loose file!
Open order!

00:57.622 --> 00:59.581
[man speaking indistinctly]

00:59.624 --> 01:00.799
Load!

01:00.843 --> 01:01.887
Aim!

01:01.931 --> 01:02.932
Fire!

01:08.155 --> 01:09.939
[grunting]

01:13.943 --> 01:14.944
MEN:
Huzzah!

01:14.987 --> 01:16.206
[man speaking indistinctly]

01:18.165 --> 01:20.167
[ringtone playing]

01:21.559 --> 01:24.127
Come on, man.

01:24.171 --> 01:27.304
Really?[ringtone continues]

01:27.348 --> 01:31.221
This is supposed to be
an immersive experience.

01:31.265 --> 01:34.268
No tech post-1776.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.923
Dude, you think I didn't see
the Fitbit under your sleeve?

01:37.967 --> 01:40.317
My wife's been keeping track
of my cardio.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.406
At least it doesn't ring.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.194
Damn, George.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.370
How did you do that
to your chest?

01:49.413 --> 01:52.503
That looks amazing.

01:52.547 --> 01:54.505
Seriously, man.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.334
Are those squibs?

01:59.945 --> 02:03.210
God... George is dead.

02:03.253 --> 02:06.343
Yeah, we all are.
Lie still.

02:06.387 --> 02:09.433
No, guys,
George is dead for real.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.143
â™ª

02:27.669 --> 02:29.410
Well, that definitely
wasn't made with a musket.

02:29.453 --> 02:30.672
Someone brought a modern
gun to a historical battle.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.022
His name's George Nix,
55 years old,

02:33.065 --> 02:35.155
address Upper East Side.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.417
Owns a chain of gyms.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.940
And it would appear
he was a lieutenant

02:37.983 --> 02:39.071
in the British infantry.

02:39.115 --> 02:41.291
Yeah, he was part
of a Revolutionary War

02:41.335 --> 02:42.858
reenactment here this morning.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.687
Something called
"The Battle of Harlem Heights."

02:45.730 --> 02:48.168
The scene of Washington's
first real success.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.257
After months of defeats
and retreats,

02:50.300 --> 02:51.997
he used a squad of rangers
to draw the British

02:52.041 --> 02:53.738
out of position and
then overrun them.

02:53.782 --> 02:56.176
The, uh, colonists then learned
to press their native advantage,

02:56.219 --> 02:57.960
employ more guerrilla tactics.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.701
Some people see it as
the beginning of the end.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.093
Well, we just see it
as the beginning

03:01.137 --> 03:02.356
this side of the pond.

03:02.399 --> 03:05.228
Nix was acting out
the British defeat.

03:05.272 --> 03:08.057
He and half a dozen others
fell down, playing dead,

03:08.100 --> 03:09.537
and then somebody
realized that, for him,

03:09.580 --> 03:11.234
it was no act.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
A number of his compatriots
must have seen the shooting.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.542
Yeah, well,
the problem is

03:14.585 --> 03:15.630
that they were all expecting

03:15.673 --> 03:17.284
to be in a gun battle.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.155
Nobody realized they were
dealing with live fire.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.071
It would be hard to devise
a less agreeable crime scene.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.638
Hundreds of men,
all dressed the same,

03:23.681 --> 03:26.249
all carrying weapons,
and all with gunpowder residue

03:26.293 --> 03:27.337
on their hands.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.339
Could be worse--
could have gone down

03:29.383 --> 03:31.646
while they were crossing
the Delaware.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.866
Come on, let's go talk
to the witnesses.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.307
Because he was on my left.That's when everybody
started shooting.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.222
By the time I looked to the
tree line, he was already down.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.701
Gentlemen, we can only
really understand

03:43.745 --> 03:45.137
six of you at a time.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.791
Would you repeat
what you said about

03:46.835 --> 03:48.053
someone hiding
in the foliage?

03:48.097 --> 03:49.272
Yeah, I was just saying
there was

03:49.316 --> 03:50.839
this clump of maple trees
behind the Yanks

03:50.882 --> 03:52.188
during that last skirmish.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.712
My guess is, whoever shot
George was hiding there.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.323
I mean, the guy
probably slipped out

03:56.366 --> 03:57.193
after he pulled
the trigger.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.847
You guess or you saw?

03:58.890 --> 04:02.111
I guess.
I mean, it just makes sense.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.722
I saw, I think, uh,
there was a guy--

04:04.766 --> 04:06.289
brown hair, medium build...

04:06.333 --> 04:08.596
You mean the tall guy?Yeah, uh, maybe.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.206
He was in an artillery
uniform, right?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.948
I think the guy I saw
had a cavalry saber.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.254
I-- you know, I'm not--
I'm not sure.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.168
There was smoke everywhere.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.822
Didn't you say you saw a car?

04:17.866 --> 04:19.346
Yeah, a-a white van

04:19.389 --> 04:21.216
on the far side
of the park.

04:21.261 --> 04:25.177
Right. So I-I think maybe my guy
jumped in and drove off.

04:25.221 --> 04:27.049
So, a man of average build,
or possibly tall,

04:27.092 --> 04:29.269
who was infantry or cavalry,

04:29.312 --> 04:31.880
fled on foot or in a white van.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.927
Any of you hear anything
out of the ordinary?

04:35.971 --> 04:37.407
[sighs]

04:37.451 --> 04:39.322
Most of us put these
in our ears.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.758
Gets pretty loud
during our battles.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.239
Actually, you know,
I could have sworn

04:43.283 --> 04:45.328
I heard a .308
in that volley

04:45.372 --> 04:47.243
right before George
got hit.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.853
Sounded like my
brother-in-law's gun.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.507
It had that kind
of pop to it.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.422
We're gonna have you,
have you all,

04:52.466 --> 04:54.076
come down to the station
to give us written statements.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.251
All right?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.122
Thank you very much,
gentlemen.

04:59.124 --> 05:01.344
Even for a group of adults
who play dress-up in the woods,

05:01.388 --> 05:03.346
they're confused.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.174
But the entry and exit wounds
did look like they were made

05:05.217 --> 05:06.306
by a .308.

05:06.349 --> 05:08.046
I posted people
at all the park exits

05:08.090 --> 05:10.310
to check the reenactors' rifles
before they're released.

05:10.353 --> 05:13.356
I'm also gonna put out a Finest
Message for the white van.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.053
We can only hope for the best.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.838
Let's hope that Marcus
and Watson had more luck.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.883
Where were you
at that point?

05:18.927 --> 05:21.930
[indistinct radio transmission]

05:27.762 --> 05:29.372
MAN:
I told George this would happen.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.287
I warned him a dozen times.
You don't hire a bodyguard

05:31.331 --> 05:33.289
and then tell him
not to guard your body.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.986
So you didn't go
onto the battlefield

05:35.030 --> 05:37.119
with Mr. Nix
during the reenactment?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.642
He said there weren't
any guys who looked like me

05:38.686 --> 05:40.514
fighting for the British army
in colonial times.

05:40.557 --> 05:43.343
So, come out here, and there's,
like, a thousand people

05:43.386 --> 05:44.561
running around with guns,

05:44.605 --> 05:47.390
and he's got me in the car

05:47.434 --> 05:49.566
for "historical accuracy."

05:49.610 --> 05:51.351
I'm curious,
why did Mr. Nix

05:51.394 --> 05:52.656
have a bodyguard at all?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.528
You ever work out
at a Centrix Gym?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.486
No, but I've seen 'em around.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.967
Right. I mean, George
didn't own them all,

05:59.010 --> 06:01.970
but he owned the brand
and the marketing system.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.015
So people could
pay him a fee

06:04.059 --> 06:05.539
and own their own franchise.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.845
It must have been pretty
profitable for your boss.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.586
Those gyms are
all over the place.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.327
The money was pouring in,

06:11.371 --> 06:12.589
but so were the death threats.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.982
For who?

06:14.025 --> 06:16.419
Well, a lot of people
took on debt

06:16.463 --> 06:17.768
to buy into the business.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.683
And then they found out
it was almost impossible

06:19.727 --> 06:21.250
to get out of the red.

06:21.293 --> 06:22.686
Some of 'em sell
their cars,

06:22.730 --> 06:25.472
their homes just to keep
from going under.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.212
George kept it out of the news,

06:27.256 --> 06:29.040
but there had been
a lot of bankruptcies.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.607
And these people
blame your boss?

06:30.651 --> 06:32.696
Well, it was in their contract
they had to buy

06:32.740 --> 06:34.785
used equipment at big markups

06:34.829 --> 06:36.570
from people who had joined
the company before them.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.399
Sounds like some sort
of a pyramid scheme to me.

06:39.442 --> 06:42.402
Because it pretty much is one.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.881
People started sending e-mails

06:43.925 --> 06:45.317
saying they wanted
to hurt George,

06:45.361 --> 06:46.710
talking about how
they were gonna

06:46.754 --> 06:48.451
track him down and kill him.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.061
One guy said he wanted
to cut George's head off

06:50.105 --> 06:51.672
and feed it to his poodle.

06:51.715 --> 06:52.847
That's when he called me.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
You still have
these e-mails?

06:54.501 --> 06:57.155
The security company
I work for has access

06:57.199 --> 06:59.897
to all of George's accounts
so that we can monitor threats.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.682
I'll send you a password.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.555
Three little maids
from school are we,

07:05.599 --> 07:08.515
pert as a schoolgirl
well may be,

07:08.558 --> 07:11.169
filled to the brim
with girlish glee,

07:11.213 --> 07:12.954
three little maids
from school.

07:12.997 --> 07:15.391
Not a very enthusiastic
performance,

07:15.435 --> 07:17.132
but thanks for
the demonstration.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.176
At least we know
your long-term memory

07:18.220 --> 07:19.830
is unaffected.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.398
Evidently my last concussion
was not enough

07:22.442 --> 07:25.053
to erase my schoolboy years
with Gilbert and Sullivan.

07:25.096 --> 07:28.056
There are elective
procedures for that.

07:28.099 --> 07:29.840
Joking aside, Dr. Hanson,

07:29.884 --> 07:32.016
that light of yours is
pure agony.

07:33.844 --> 07:34.932
The headaches
are getting worse?

07:34.976 --> 07:36.281
And more frequent.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.587
They're interfering
with my focus,

07:37.631 --> 07:39.720
my sleep, my existence.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.591
Are you taking the gabapentin
I prescribed?

07:41.635 --> 07:43.550
It's not helping?

07:43.593 --> 07:46.204
Point of fact, I think
my symptoms are getting worse.

07:46.248 --> 07:49.033
Blurred vision, short-term
memory loss, the pain.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
It's just not the trajectory
I'd hoped for

07:51.558 --> 07:53.037
when I put myself in your care.

07:53.081 --> 07:56.171
Haven't I been
straight with you?

07:56.214 --> 07:58.608
Recovery from
post-concussion syndrome

07:58.652 --> 07:59.870
doesn't happen overnight.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.003
Your brain needs time
to heal itself.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.353
Recovery can be circuitous.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.529
So that's the sum total
of your professional advice--

08:06.573 --> 08:09.053
just wait and hope for the best?

08:09.097 --> 08:11.839
I'm raising your dose
of gabapentin

08:11.882 --> 08:14.363
from 200 milligrams
to 400 milligrams.

08:14.406 --> 08:17.497
It might make you drowsy,
but you shouldn't notice

08:17.540 --> 08:18.889
any other changes.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.457
And if that doesn't
do the trick,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.590
we'll keep upping the dosage
until it does.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.330
[sighs]

08:25.374 --> 08:28.551
I know you don't like putting
more pills in your body,

08:28.595 --> 08:30.988
but you haven't had
a euphoric reaction.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.337
I don't believe you're
at any risk of dependency.

08:33.381 --> 08:37.472
Gabapentin may not
typically be habit-forming,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.650
but I am.
Sherlock,

08:40.693 --> 08:43.087
this medication's
the best option

08:43.131 --> 08:45.525
for someone with your history
of addiction

08:45.568 --> 08:47.091
and the symptoms you've shown.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.616
Trust me.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.579
What is that on your head?

08:56.623 --> 08:59.408
It's a welder's mask
from the 1930s.

08:59.451 --> 09:01.323
Okay.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.803
Why is it on your head?

09:02.846 --> 09:05.022
The Filterweld lenses
offer better protection

09:05.066 --> 09:06.763
against glare than
regular sunglasses.

09:06.807 --> 09:09.113
Your headache's that bad?

09:09.157 --> 09:11.028
Calling it a headache is
an understatement.

09:11.072 --> 09:13.509
You know, staring
at a computer monitor

09:13.553 --> 09:15.467
does not help--
I got this.
No, no.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.600
It's fine. I just finished
going through the threats

09:17.644 --> 09:19.515
made against Mr. Nix.
[clears throat]

09:19.559 --> 09:21.082
And?

09:21.125 --> 09:23.867
Well, he's not winning
any popularity contests.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.521
Half of his franchisees
truly loathe him,

09:25.565 --> 09:26.609
but I don't think
any of them are

09:26.653 --> 09:29.090
the architects of his demise.Why not?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.613
This crime was planned
well in advance.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.615
Our killer was patient
and exacting.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.225
These are not traits
that spring to mind

09:34.269 --> 09:35.531
when you read e-mails like,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.707
"I am serious, bro,
I'll beat your ass

09:37.751 --> 09:39.666
until you see stars
in the daytime."

09:39.709 --> 09:41.232
They're all like this?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.669
No, this one stands out

09:42.712 --> 09:44.279
for its proper spelling
and punctuation.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.934
Even if any of these
delightful epistolarians

09:46.977 --> 09:48.631
did harbor homicidal
tendencies,

09:48.675 --> 09:50.938
it seems unlikely
that any of them

09:50.981 --> 09:53.897
would know that Mr. Nix
planned to travel back

09:53.941 --> 09:56.726
to 1776 yesterday and make
himself such a ripe target.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.555
Well...

09:59.599 --> 10:01.557
So, the e-mails are
a dead end.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.689
Not entirely.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.299
I found some turbulent
correspondence

10:04.342 --> 10:08.172
between George and
his daughter Marcy.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.353
WATSON:
That's nasty stuff.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.181
Doesn't sound like Thanksgiving
at the Nixes' house

10:17.225 --> 10:18.313
would be much fun.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.620
But then again, you know,

10:20.663 --> 10:22.404
a lot of people argue
with their parents.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.754
Read the last bit.

10:27.452 --> 10:28.671
She dropped off the map

10:28.715 --> 10:29.977
after severing ties
with her father

10:30.020 --> 10:31.369
and told him that
she would kill him

10:31.413 --> 10:33.502
if he ever came looking for her.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.330
I wonder if she's
still in his will.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.201
That is a question
worth asking her.

10:37.245 --> 10:41.075
I managed to track her to
an address in Montebello,

10:41.118 --> 10:43.338
which is 35 miles
northwest of the city.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.514
If you leave now,
you could buy yourself a meal

10:45.557 --> 10:47.559
which doesn't smell
like decomposing cassowary.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.301
You don't feel
like coming along?

10:50.345 --> 10:52.739
It's not that. I just, I have
to meet with, um, Michael.

10:52.782 --> 10:53.957
I've mentioned him before.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.306
Yeah, a couple of times.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.612
Wait, is he
your new sponsor?

10:56.656 --> 10:57.744
No.

10:57.787 --> 10:59.746
But I do recognize
that it's important

10:59.789 --> 11:01.356
to talk to people
in times like this,

11:01.399 --> 11:02.966
and he made
himself available.

11:03.010 --> 11:06.230
So, I appreciate that.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.885
Now more than usual.

11:20.244 --> 11:22.203
[knock at door]

11:22.246 --> 11:23.857
Hey.
Wow, you got here fast.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.642
Sorry about the mess.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.296
Don't be; you
should see my place.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.299
[chuckles] "If a cluttered desk
is a sign of a cluttered mind,

11:31.342 --> 11:33.344
of what, then,
is an empty desk a sign of?"

11:33.388 --> 11:34.432
Who said that?

11:34.476 --> 11:35.520
Einstein.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.087
That guy.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.568
You know, when he wasn't busy
figuring out the universe,

11:39.611 --> 11:42.049
he sure could crank out quotes
for a fridge magnet.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.488
Do you want to grab
a cup of coffee downstairs?

11:46.531 --> 11:47.489
Yeah.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.534
Okay.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.711
Your doctor doubled your
dose, just like that?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.801
Mm, he says there's no reason
not to be aggressive.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.673
I've shown no signs of physical
dependency to gabapentin,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.763
and, uh, the symptoms of my PCS
have been getting worse.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.983
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.028
Yeah. Well, I'm not in any pain
at the moment.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.987
So it's possible
the medication's working.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.816
Right, but you're
anxious about it.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.383
Worried it won't work?

12:12.427 --> 12:14.646
I'm actually more fearful
that it will work.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.780
Right, I get it.
You're an addict.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.564
The idea that you
need more drugs...

12:19.608 --> 12:20.740
can't be easy.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.132
When I was using,

12:22.176 --> 12:24.134
I, um,

12:24.178 --> 12:26.223
I used this tortured calculus

12:26.267 --> 12:29.574
to, uh, come up with
all sorts of reasons

12:29.618 --> 12:33.274
that would justify stuffing
my veins with chemicals.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.189
I want to get better,

12:35.232 --> 12:36.668
but I just don't, I just don't

12:36.712 --> 12:38.540
want to go back
to thinking that way.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.805
Well, last time we spoke,

12:42.849 --> 12:44.981
you said you had a partner
who was a doctor.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.157
Wh-What did she say
about all this?

12:47.201 --> 12:48.680
I didn't discuss it with her.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.813
How come?
Because I know
what she'll say.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.033
She'll say that Dr. Hanson
is the finest neurologist

12:53.076 --> 12:54.686
on the Eastern Seaboard,
and he wouldn't

12:54.730 --> 12:55.992
prescribe this medication
if he didn't think

12:56.036 --> 12:57.602
it was the best course
of action.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.213
She'd also say that
I'm very, very strong

12:59.256 --> 13:01.781
in my program of recovery
and that I shouldn't worry.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.695
Maybe she's right.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.523
I mean, recovery's a team sport.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.178
That's... why we sit
in church basements

13:08.222 --> 13:10.528
and rec centers with
people we don't know.

13:10.572 --> 13:14.837
Because we need
other people's help.

13:14.881 --> 13:18.058
We need to allow ourselves
to be helped.

13:18.101 --> 13:20.843
Do you think I should
stay on medication?

13:20.887 --> 13:24.107
Honestly,
who cares what I think?

13:24.151 --> 13:25.935
I mean, you're sober.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.807
You know, there's no way
you could've done that

13:27.850 --> 13:30.200
without trusting
the people around you.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.811
And right now,
when you're in pain

13:31.854 --> 13:33.334
and can't think straight?

13:33.377 --> 13:35.945
It's probably not the best time
to change the formula.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.514
MARCY:
I always told Dad

13:39.557 --> 13:41.733
capitalism was gonna kill him.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.126
I don't mean to be difficult,

13:43.170 --> 13:45.912
but we can't bring charges
against capitalism.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.522
We're looking for the
person who shot him,

13:47.565 --> 13:49.916
and we're here to find out if
you know anything about it.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.832
You think I killed my dad?

13:52.875 --> 13:54.746
We talked to your
father's accountant.

13:54.790 --> 13:57.619
It's his understanding
you're about to inherit

13:57.662 --> 13:59.142
more than $5 million.

13:59.186 --> 14:00.752
WATSON: We know that you and
your father were estranged.

14:00.796 --> 14:04.931
We have the e-mails that you
sent to him six months ago.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.239
Yeah, I said some things
I regret,

14:09.283 --> 14:11.894
but like you said,
that was six months ago.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.766
I'm a completely
different person now.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.030
I've found my true self
here at the commune.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.032
Okay, but your previous self

14:19.075 --> 14:22.339
threatened to shoot him
if he ever contacted you again.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.558
Did he?

14:23.601 --> 14:24.907
No.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.257
And I've let all that anger go.

14:27.301 --> 14:30.347
[scoffs] I don't even step
on ants anymore.

14:30.391 --> 14:33.089
There's no way
I would kill my own father.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.438
WATSON:
You wouldn't have to.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.918
You're about to be rich.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
There are people you can hire
to do that for you.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.922
People? What people?

14:39.966 --> 14:42.882
The only people I know
are here at the commune,

14:42.925 --> 14:46.363
and all of us were on a vision
hike at Harriman State Park.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.496
You can check with the rangers
there if you want.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.847
Plenty of potential guns
for hire outside these walls.

14:53.849 --> 14:54.937
Even if that were true,

14:54.981 --> 14:57.113
there's no way
I could contact them.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.246
There's no technology allowed
on grounds here.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.944
You had to check your phones
at the door, right?

15:01.988 --> 15:06.949
If I were to hire some secret
assassin, I'd have to do it

15:06.993 --> 15:08.690
with smoke signals.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.955
Look, I get it.

15:12.999 --> 15:16.393
A lot of people probably
would kill for $5 million.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.482
But I won't touch a dime.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.485
Growing up, I saw what
my dad's money did to him--

15:21.529 --> 15:25.141
it turned him into this...
soulless machine.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.927
And I was afraid it was gonna
do the same thing to me.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.799
That's why I sold all my
stuff and moved up here.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.975
Whatever inheritance
comes my way,

15:33.019 --> 15:35.891
it is a noose, not a blessing.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.980
I'll give it all away.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.207
What do you think you
do on a vision hike?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.904
Look around, I guess.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.167
I mean, we can call the rangers
at the park that she mentioned,

15:51.211 --> 15:52.995
but I'm guessing
she's telling the truth.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.911
I didn't get a "killer" vibe
in there, did you?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.392
BELL: I'm not sure I'm buying
that she wouldn't step on bugs,

15:58.435 --> 15:59.915
but no.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.873
Murdering her father?
I don't see it.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.701
I'll take another pass
at the e-mail threats

16:03.745 --> 16:04.964
that George Nix received.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.487
Maybe Sherlock and I
missed something.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.488
[line ringing]

16:07.531 --> 16:08.968
Hey, Captain.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.708
GREGSON: Where are you?
I've been calling.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.884
Sorry. We had to check
our phones at the door

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
when we got to
Marcy Nix's commune.

16:14.582 --> 16:15.583
Something up?

16:15.626 --> 16:17.193
Are you with her right now?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.021
No, but we were a minute ago.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.893
Neither of us likes her for
what happened to her dad. Why?

16:21.937 --> 16:24.026
Because if you were
just with her,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.160
I guess we can also clear her
for burning his house down.

16:29.031 --> 16:29.945
What are you talking about?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.903
Fire started an hour ago.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.862
Fire department
did the best they could,

16:33.905 --> 16:36.430
but the place is a total loss.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.520
Someone really didn't like
George Nix.

16:39.563 --> 16:41.043
When they killed him,

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
looks like they were
just getting started.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.836
Morning. Got your text.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.014
Fire marshal's report came in?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.667
Initial findings.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.191
Just the thing
to start your day.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.584
Arson at the Nix home
is confirmed.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.630
It was started
with a blend of thermite

17:02.673 --> 17:04.935
and something called napalm B.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.113
Put the two together
and you get a mixture

17:07.156 --> 17:09.897
that burns a lot hotter
than your average house fire.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.813
Explains why the place
went up so fast.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.292
Thermite? Napalm B?

17:13.336 --> 17:15.295
Where does someone
get that stuff?

17:15.338 --> 17:16.339
I had the same question.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.037
Didn't love the answer.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.126
There are recipes online.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.736
Everything you need,
you can find

17:21.779 --> 17:23.259
at your local hardware store.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.392
We can call the
stores in the area,

17:25.435 --> 17:27.742
see if anyone recently bought
all the ingredients at once.

17:27.785 --> 17:30.005
I already got people checking,
but I'm not holding my breath.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.615
Whoever did this was careful.

17:31.659 --> 17:32.747
BELL:
Yeah.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.532
No prints or DNA recovered
at the scene.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.839
This is interesting, though.

17:37.882 --> 17:41.799
They think that was left
by the guy who set the fire.

17:41.843 --> 17:43.279
WATSON:
Why is that?

17:43.323 --> 17:45.760
The soil composition
is a match for the park

17:45.803 --> 17:47.283
where the reenactment was held.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.198
So it's not just the timing

17:49.242 --> 17:52.245
that makes it look like the same
person that was behind the fire

17:52.288 --> 17:53.855
was behind the murder.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.727
Well, whoever he is, I think
he committed a third crime.

17:56.771 --> 17:59.817
Before he burned George
Nix's house down,

17:59.861 --> 18:01.123
he looted it.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.385
What are we talking about?

18:02.429 --> 18:04.431
Well, antique silver
forged by Paul Revere,

18:04.474 --> 18:05.823
among other things.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.216
I've been reading
up on the victim.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.914
He wasn't just a
Revolutionary War reenactor.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.440
He had a collection of
artifacts from that period.

18:13.483 --> 18:16.225
Early flags, old documents,
that kind of thing.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.488
Including a set of
Paul Revere's silver?

18:18.532 --> 18:19.881
WATSON:
Yeah. He posed next to it

18:19.924 --> 18:21.056
when this interior
design magazine

18:21.100 --> 18:22.362
featured his house last year;

18:22.405 --> 18:23.928
you can see it in the photos.

18:23.972 --> 18:27.062
All this metal, there's none
of it in those photos.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.281
Yeah, and there's nothing

18:28.324 --> 18:29.891
in the report
about the fire department

18:29.934 --> 18:31.327
recovering melted silver,
either.

18:31.371 --> 18:33.721
So this guy could've stolen
a bunch of artifacts,

18:33.764 --> 18:35.331
then torched the place

18:35.375 --> 18:37.725
to cover his tracks.
WATSON:
Well, it would be a big score.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.335
I mean, the silver alone's

18:39.379 --> 18:41.424
got to be worth
a quarter of a million dollars.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.470
[exhales]
Okay.

18:43.513 --> 18:46.734
But if all our guy wanted was
to rip off Nix, why kill him?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.779
Why draw that kind of attention?

18:48.823 --> 18:50.781
Well, the community of people

18:50.825 --> 18:52.348
that deal with
this kind of stuff

18:52.392 --> 18:54.002
has got to be pretty small.

18:54.045 --> 18:56.961
Maybe George Nix would've been
able to guess who robbed him.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.485
[elevator bell dings]

19:00.226 --> 19:01.314
We're in the middle
of a murder investigation.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.837
Why didn't you wake me up?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.665
I made a pretty big racket
in the kitchen this morning.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.493
I don't think a marching band
could've woken you up.

19:06.536 --> 19:07.494
You were out.

19:07.537 --> 19:08.886
It must be the gabapentin.

19:08.930 --> 19:10.410
And I've only just started
taking a higher dose,

19:10.453 --> 19:12.020
and I'm already
feeling the effects.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.630
The fact that I'm upright is
a credit to our French press.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.110
Well, you're not
gonna recover

19:15.154 --> 19:17.373
from PCS unless you get
some sleep; you need your rest.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.027
I need my work, too.
What's this?

19:19.070 --> 19:21.595
That is the initial arson report
from George Nix's house.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.205
You can read it on the way.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.425
[elevator bell dings]

19:25.468 --> 19:27.427
And where are we going?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.516
To find Paul Revere's silver.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.262
Hello. Uh, we're looking
for Detective Mason,

19:36.305 --> 19:38.438
was told he might be
of some assistance.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.440
MASON:
Sherlock Holmes.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.573
Are you seriously gonna pretend
you don't remember me?

19:43.617 --> 19:44.922
No, I know you.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.533
You used to
have more hair.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.491
You had a lot more hair.
You're Detective Mason.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.450
I helped you solve a case
six years ago,

19:50.493 --> 19:52.365
back when you were just a guy
with a funny name.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.845
Yes, of course. That poor man
with a cleaver lodged in his...

19:54.889 --> 19:55.933
Yeah.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.283
You were still
working with me

19:57.326 --> 19:58.719
in "another capacity"
at the time.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.808
Oh, you were still
in the habit of ditching me.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.418
Mm-hmm.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.899
I recall your presence
but not your assistance.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.422
You and me-- we had something.

20:06.466 --> 20:09.686
I thought teaming with you
was the start of something big.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.906
But once we closed the case,
you dumped me.

20:11.949 --> 20:13.081
Paired up with Marcus Bell

20:13.124 --> 20:14.517
and helped make him a star.

20:14.561 --> 20:16.345
I made no one a star.
Marcus Bell is a fine detective

20:16.389 --> 20:17.346
in his own right.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.391
And I'm not?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.044
WATSON:
You are the NYPD's

20:20.088 --> 20:23.047
foremost expert when it comes
to stolen historical artifacts.

20:23.091 --> 20:25.528
At least that's what
we've been told.

20:25.572 --> 20:27.443
Can you help us?

20:27.487 --> 20:29.576
Follow me.

20:35.538 --> 20:37.540
So this guy, George Nix,
somebody burned his house down

20:37.584 --> 20:39.150
and killed him?WATSON: Not in that order,

20:39.194 --> 20:40.456
but yes.
We think they were after

20:40.500 --> 20:42.632
his Revolutionary War
memorabilia.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.678
The silver is missing
and there's no way to know

20:44.721 --> 20:48.290
if the fabric and paper
items really burned up

20:48.334 --> 20:49.944
or if they were taken.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.120
There's only a few places you
can really move stuff like that.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.514
So, uh... I'll help you.

20:54.557 --> 20:55.993
But, uh...

20:56.037 --> 20:58.344
you're gonna help me, too.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.649
How so?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.216
Six months ago,

21:01.260 --> 21:04.654
an 1860 Old Tom Morris
long-nose golf club

21:04.698 --> 21:06.395
was stolen from the home
of a woman

21:06.439 --> 21:08.354
by the name of
Gertrude Hardcastle.

21:08.397 --> 21:09.746
Worth a hundred grand.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.618
The thieves broke in
through the first floor window.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.184
As you can see,
they knocked over

21:13.228 --> 21:14.403
a bookcase
when they went in.

21:14.447 --> 21:15.404
They disappeared
with the club,

21:15.448 --> 21:16.623
nobody's seen 'em since.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.015
Now, if you

21:18.059 --> 21:19.669
can help me find it...It's here.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.323
What?It's right here.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.672
There was no burglary.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.500
It wasn't stolen.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.894
The golf club is in the
umbrella stand

21:26.937 --> 21:29.418
in Mrs. Hardcastle's
foyer.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.812
Note the gouge marks on
the front leg of the bookcase.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.988
They were made by the
Staffordshire Terrier

21:34.031 --> 21:35.250
which appears in several
of these photographs.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.469
It's a breed known
for chewing.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.774
The dog gnawed
at the bookcase

21:37.818 --> 21:39.602
until it fell over,
breaking the window.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.995
That tripped the alarm.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.126
How did you...?I submit

21:42.170 --> 21:43.214
the golf club
is in the umbrella stand

21:43.258 --> 21:44.651
because Mrs. Hardcastle
put it there.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.435
She was confused.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.655
When she couldn't find it
in the wake of the "break-in,"

21:48.698 --> 21:50.047
she assumed it'd
been stolen.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.572
Case closed.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.667
I'll make some calls for you,
see if anybody's trying to sell

22:00.710 --> 22:03.409
any items that have to do
with the Revolutionary War.

22:03.452 --> 22:04.932
Great. We look forward
to hearing from you.

22:11.242 --> 22:12.418
Chief Cruz?

22:12.461 --> 22:14.942
Thanks for coming in.

22:14.985 --> 22:17.771
I'm Marcus Bell. This is
Sherlock Holmes, Joan Watson.

22:17.814 --> 22:22.341
The folks at Southside Pawn
thought you might be able

22:22.384 --> 22:24.560
to shed some light on
a few things for us.

22:24.604 --> 22:26.170
They said you called
them about...

22:26.214 --> 22:28.912
The stuff I stole
from that guy's house.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.784
I'm sorry, okay?

22:30.827 --> 22:32.786
All right? I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.483
But I'll give it all back.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.485
Very generous of you. But
how are you gonna give back

22:36.529 --> 22:37.747
George Nix's life?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.358
What are you talking about?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.055
Nobody died in that fire.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.578
BELL: George Nix
was shot and killed

22:42.622 --> 22:45.233
during a Revolutionary
War reenactment

22:45.276 --> 22:47.061
a few hours before it started.

22:47.104 --> 22:49.585
We're guessing it was
to divert our attention.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.545
Get us looking one place while
you set a fire at another.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.285
You think that I set that blaze?

22:54.329 --> 22:55.548
Last night,
you were on

22:55.591 --> 22:56.940
one of the trucks
that put out the fire

22:56.984 --> 22:58.594
at Mr. Nix's mansion.

22:58.638 --> 23:00.683
When we started looking
into you, we realized

23:00.727 --> 23:02.424
it was the second time
you'd been on a call

23:02.468 --> 23:03.512
to his address.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.296
WATSON:
Earlier last year,

23:05.340 --> 23:06.907
the electrical panel
at the house shorted out

23:06.950 --> 23:08.256
and started smoking.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.518
Your crew got the call
to check it out.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.650
We're guessing that's when

23:10.693 --> 23:12.478
you saw his
collection.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.436
We know whoever torched
the place used a mixture

23:14.480 --> 23:15.655
of thermite and napalm B.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.396
Yeah? So?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.136
So this wasn't a gas can
and matches.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.051
The guy who did it
had some expertise.

23:21.095 --> 23:23.750
HOLMES: You wouldn't be
the first in your profession

23:23.793 --> 23:26.317
to moonlight as an arsonist.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.277
After we got the blaze
under control last night,

23:29.320 --> 23:32.672
I went inside
to search the place.

23:32.715 --> 23:37.546
Okay? I-I... I found a
bunch of, uh, antique silver

23:37.590 --> 23:40.897
in the living room, and a fire
safe in one of the closets,

23:40.941 --> 23:43.334
and I figured there might
be some money in the safe,

23:43.378 --> 23:44.945
and I could sell the silver,

23:44.988 --> 23:47.513
so I packed
my gear with it,

23:47.556 --> 23:49.210
and I took it
with me outside.

23:49.253 --> 23:51.212
It-it was, like, y-you know,
spur of the moment.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.736
I saw it, I grabbed it,
and that was it.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.738
I didn't start the fire.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.653
And I sure as hell
didn't kill anyone.

23:59.133 --> 24:03.137
If you let me go to my car,
I can prove it.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.794
See?

24:07.837 --> 24:09.317
The silver is ruined.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.493
There was no money in the safe,
just some old documents,

24:11.537 --> 24:12.712
and they couldn't
take the heat.

24:12.755 --> 24:15.236
Now, why would I
plan a big heist,

24:15.279 --> 24:17.847
and then leave all the stuff
that I wanted to steal

24:17.891 --> 24:20.589
inside the house
while it burned?

24:20.633 --> 24:22.286
And you said you can account
for your whereabouts

24:22.330 --> 24:24.245
between 9:00 and
10:00 a.m. yesterday?

24:24.288 --> 24:26.203
Yeah. I was at
the station all day.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.814
All the guys will tell you.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.511
And we got cameras there, too.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.774
I mean, you believe me now?

24:31.818 --> 24:32.645
I do.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.473
But I wish I didn't.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.084
Pretty sure we're back
to square one with the murder.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.480
[pots clattering]

24:49.749 --> 24:51.446
[exhales]

24:51.490 --> 24:53.492
What is that smell?

24:53.535 --> 24:54.623
Progress.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.278
Ugh. I thought you went to bed.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.280
I did. I slept soundly.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.847
And then I didn't.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.501
The medication continues
to wreak havoc

25:02.544 --> 25:03.806
with my circadian rhythms.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.156
I thought I'd put
my wakefulness to good use.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.202
Okay. By doing what, exactly?

25:08.245 --> 25:09.986
Rectifying
an embarrassing oversight.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.206
We missed a glaringly
obvious deduction yesterday.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.729
I'm going to blame
the gabapentin.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.688
I'm not sure
what your excuse is.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.429
Okay, just tell me
what we missed.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.954
You'll recall the accelerant
used to torch George Nix's home

25:20.997 --> 25:24.000
was a mixture of thermite
and napalm B, which would burn

25:24.044 --> 25:26.263
at about a thousand degrees
hotter than necessary

25:26.307 --> 25:27.569
to burn down a house

25:27.613 --> 25:29.397
made mostly
of wood and plaster.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.616
So?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.008
So what if the house

25:32.052 --> 25:33.880
wasn't the arsonist's
true target?

25:33.923 --> 25:35.751
What if they wanted
to destroy something

25:35.795 --> 25:37.884
far more resistant
to great heat?

25:37.927 --> 25:40.669
WATSON: The safe the fire
chief took from the wreckage.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.149
You took it
from the property room?

25:42.192 --> 25:44.499
Along with the remains
of the documents it contained.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.631
It's top-of-the-line.

25:45.674 --> 25:46.675
It's rated to survive

25:46.719 --> 25:48.068
a heated environment in excess

25:48.111 --> 25:49.896
of 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit.

25:49.939 --> 25:53.203
And yet, it was no match
for the accelerant used.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.858
You'll recall the fire chief
was quite disappointed

25:55.902 --> 25:57.077
the contents
were ruined.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.252
So it wasn't a robbery,

25:58.295 --> 26:00.254
it was a demolition.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.082
Well, an attempted one, anyway.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.910
Well, it looks
like it worked, to me.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.868
Only temporarily.

26:05.912 --> 26:06.826
What do you mean?

26:06.869 --> 26:07.914
The smell. Hmm?

26:07.957 --> 26:09.045
During the Second World War,

26:09.089 --> 26:10.481
my countrymen developed a method

26:10.525 --> 26:13.397
to restore
burnt documents recovered

26:13.441 --> 26:14.921
from bombed out enemy bases.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.532
It begins with a 25% solution
of chloral hydrate.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.707
Okay-- well, I don't
care what it is,

26:18.751 --> 26:20.622
I just... I want it to stop.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.885
I mean, you really think reading
a bunch of burnt documents

26:22.929 --> 26:23.843
is gonna help?

26:23.886 --> 26:24.931
Oh, it already has.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.193
I now have
a very good idea

26:26.236 --> 26:27.977
who killed George Nix.

26:28.021 --> 26:29.588
And why.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.727
You think George Nix was killed
and his house got burned down

26:38.771 --> 26:40.599
because the killer wanted
to destroy some autographs?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.383
That's all that was in the
safe, and the safe seems

26:42.426 --> 26:43.602
to have been the real target.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.908
What's so special
about these autographs?

26:45.952 --> 26:47.388
They're Button Gwinnetts.

26:47.431 --> 26:48.955
But who the hell
is Button Gwinnett?

26:48.998 --> 26:50.696
It sounds like something
out of a kid's book?

26:50.739 --> 26:53.655
Button Gwinnett was the
provisional president

26:53.699 --> 26:55.396
of colonial
Georgia, and he was

26:55.439 --> 26:58.617
one of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence.

26:58.660 --> 27:02.490
He also happens to have the most
valuable signature on Earth.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.013
Some guy I've never
even heard of

27:04.057 --> 27:06.276
has the most valuable
signature on Earth?

27:06.320 --> 27:07.669
The last Gwinnett
sold at auction

27:07.713 --> 27:10.063
went for $800,000.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.804
56 men signed

27:11.847 --> 27:13.719
the Declaration of Independence.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.721
The complete set of their
signatures is the holy grail

27:15.764 --> 27:17.113
for autograph hounds.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.115
Gwinnett's is the rarest
of the bunch.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.684
He was fairly obscure,
died shortly after the war.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.773
There are only 51 authenticated
Gwinnett signatures.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.688
That's why they're worth
so much.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.082
More valuable
than Churchill, Beethoven.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.953
Even Shakespeare.

27:30.997 --> 27:33.869
The fire loss investigator from
George Nix's insurance company

27:33.913 --> 27:36.524
sent us a list
of all the insured artifacts

27:36.567 --> 27:38.700
that were inside the house
when it burned down.

27:38.744 --> 27:41.703
There wasn't anything
about Button Gwinnett.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.965
We think that George
is making a run

27:43.009 --> 27:45.011
on cornering the market
for these autographs.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.317
If we're right, he would not
have wanted anyone to know.

27:47.361 --> 27:50.364
Sellers would jack up the prices
on any he'd want to buy.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.627
Given the rarity
of a genuine Gwinnett,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.977
it's quite possible that some
of the signatures in his trove

27:55.021 --> 27:57.937
were ill-gotten
and, thus, uninsurable.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.416
Well, let's say you're right.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.549
That this was all
about these signatures.

28:01.592 --> 28:02.985
Why burn them up?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.595
If they're so valuable,

28:04.639 --> 28:07.033
it doesn't make any sense
to destroy them.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.904
You're right, it does not.

28:08.948 --> 28:12.821
Unless of course, you've already
got a few of your own.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.127
I want to make it clear
right up front:

28:14.170 --> 28:16.825
my client, Mr. Chambers,
has no legal obligation

28:16.869 --> 28:19.175
to be here. If,
at any point,

28:19.219 --> 28:22.048
I deem it appropriate
to cut this interview short,

28:22.091 --> 28:23.876
that is exactly
what will happen.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.313
Okay. I apologize for David.

28:26.356 --> 28:28.054
I made my money
dealing in art.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.316
It's dog-eat-dog,

28:29.359 --> 28:31.187
so I've always
chosen my attorneys

28:31.231 --> 28:34.800
for their pugnaciousness.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.540
Truth is, it's--
oh, it's a treat,

28:36.584 --> 28:39.805
being inside the famous
11th precinct.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.068
You know, this structure dates
back to 1907.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.547
HOLMES: Perhaps you'd enjoy
the holding cell downstairs.

28:43.591 --> 28:45.898
It's original to the building.

28:45.941 --> 28:48.074
DAVID:
Why are we here, Detective?

28:48.117 --> 28:49.902
BELL:
A man named George Nix

28:49.945 --> 28:53.340
was gunned down during a battle
reenactment two days ago.

28:53.383 --> 28:57.648
Well, my day just got
a lot more interesting.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.476
You're accusing me of murder?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.261
WATSON:
And arson.

29:01.304 --> 29:04.351
George's house was torched a
few hours after he was killed.

29:04.394 --> 29:08.355
And you imagine
Mr. Chambers was involved, why?

29:08.398 --> 29:10.357
We have reason to believe
he was on the battlefield

29:10.400 --> 29:12.011
when Mr. Nix was shot.

29:12.054 --> 29:13.273
Based on what?
Well, I was.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.755
I never miss a battle.

29:16.798 --> 29:20.106
Oh, the pageantry,
the devotion to detail.

29:20.149 --> 29:22.282
Oh, it's just...
always a thrill.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.677
Of course, I'm not the only one
that feels that way.

29:26.721 --> 29:30.159
There were hundreds of
gun-toting reenactors there.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.683
Yes, but none of them own
the second-largest collection

29:32.727 --> 29:34.947
of Button Gwinnett
signatures in the world.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.818
You do.HOLMES: Your collection
tripled in value

29:36.862 --> 29:38.080
when George's
Gwinnetts

29:38.124 --> 29:39.821
went up in flames.

29:39.865 --> 29:40.953
Oh.

29:40.996 --> 29:43.172
Oh, that is
the last thing I wanted.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.391
Explain that.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.696
I was negotiating

29:45.740 --> 29:48.830
to buy the trove
you say I destroyed.

29:48.874 --> 29:51.833
I'd been trying to acquire
George's Gwinnetts for years.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.835
He always turned me down.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.578
But that was before his, uh, gym
franchisees started suing him.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.580
He called me
last month

29:59.623 --> 30:00.886
and asked if I was
still interested

30:00.929 --> 30:02.975
in taking his collection
off his hands.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.150
HOLMES: Well, even
if that's true,

30:04.193 --> 30:05.629
you obviously never
came to terms,

30:05.673 --> 30:07.066
or they wouldn't have
been in his safe

30:07.109 --> 30:08.415
when his house burned down.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.417
So far, you've convinced
me of two things:

30:10.460 --> 30:13.594
one, you knew about his secret
collection of Button Gwinnetts,

30:13.637 --> 30:16.989
and secondly,
you value your own very highly.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.991
Both of those things
are entirely consistent

30:19.034 --> 30:23.909
with the motive
they're ascribing to you.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.475
Let me explain something.

30:25.519 --> 30:27.738
Even if George told me
that he wouldn't sell,

30:27.782 --> 30:31.742
I would never wipe out
historical documents.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.615
I don't care how much money
we're talking about. Never.

30:34.658 --> 30:37.226
Now, the documents
in George's collection help

30:37.270 --> 30:38.358
tell the story of America.

30:38.401 --> 30:41.883
Helped shape the land
and its people.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.712
They're sacred relics
as far as I'm concerned.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.412
Now, you-you can have
my fingerprints,

30:49.456 --> 30:51.458
my DNA, whatever you want.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.721
You'll see.

30:53.764 --> 30:56.158
I'm quite innocent.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.033
Doctor.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.034
HANSON:
Sally didn't tell me

31:02.077 --> 31:03.426
you were in here.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.037
Sally didn't hear
me come in.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.516
When I called on the phone,

31:06.560 --> 31:08.214
she said you didn't have
an opening till Monday.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.432
Doesn't work for me.

31:09.476 --> 31:11.086
What can I do for you, Sherlock?

31:11.130 --> 31:13.523
Since you put me on the
higher dose of gabapentin,

31:13.567 --> 31:16.178
my sleep patterns
have been troublesome

31:16.222 --> 31:19.138
and my waking hours have been
more and more lethargic.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.617
I told you,
it'll make you drowsy.

31:20.661 --> 31:23.098
Unacceptable. There's got to be
something else.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.231
There's got to be another way
to treat my condition.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.362
There is.

31:26.406 --> 31:27.886
Rest.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.322
I know it's a four-letter word
to you.

31:29.365 --> 31:30.889
It's a four-letter word
to everyone.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.151
You know
what I mean.

31:32.194 --> 31:33.456
The first time we met,
I told you

31:33.500 --> 31:34.805
you should get out of town.

31:34.849 --> 31:35.937
Go somewhere quiet
for a few weeks,

31:35.981 --> 31:37.112
a few months.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.897
Vermont,
New Hampshire.

31:38.940 --> 31:41.334
Sit in a chair. Stare at
the mountains or something.

31:41.377 --> 31:42.901
My work is important to me.

31:42.944 --> 31:45.164
I know it is,
but you have to ask yourself,

31:45.207 --> 31:46.948
do you want to get by
or do you want to get better?

31:46.992 --> 31:50.082
If you want to get by, we can
try some different medications,

31:50.125 --> 31:52.258
maybe put you
on a course of acupuncture.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.260
But if you want to get better,

31:54.303 --> 31:57.393
the best option
is a very long vacation.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.222
No work. Just rest.

32:04.705 --> 32:07.142
Hey. How'd it go
with Dr. Hanson?

32:07.186 --> 32:08.578
What are you doing?

32:08.622 --> 32:12.104
You got my text
about Paul Chambers, right?

32:12.147 --> 32:15.803
You and Marcus don't think
he's our killer/arsonist.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.937
No, we don't, but something
he said got me thinking.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.461
What if it's not the signatures
on the documents

32:21.504 --> 32:23.985
that are important,
but the documents themselves?

32:24.029 --> 32:25.291
I've been reading
through them

32:25.334 --> 32:26.553
the last few hours.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.337
So, there's a couple
of personal letters,

32:28.381 --> 32:30.383
there's a bill of sale
for a wagon wheel,

32:30.426 --> 32:32.298
and then there's
two proclamations

32:32.341 --> 32:36.389
about wheat tariffs,
but then there is this.

32:40.610 --> 32:43.309
"Land office warrant
number 3743.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.354
"This grant hereby issued

32:45.398 --> 32:48.183
March 28, 1777."
Yada, yada, yada,

32:48.227 --> 32:51.143
"Signed Button Gwinnett,
Provisional President."

32:51.186 --> 32:52.927
It's a bounty land grant.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.537
They're contracts
that promise land to any man

32:54.581 --> 32:56.191
who agreed to fight
in the American Revolution.

32:56.235 --> 33:00.195
They're basically recruiting
tools for the Continental Army.

33:00.239 --> 33:01.544
You fight for our new country,

33:01.588 --> 33:02.981
we'll let you keep
a piece of it.

33:03.024 --> 33:06.027
So, this grant promised
a large tract in Georgia

33:06.071 --> 33:07.724
to a man named Abner Fulham.

33:07.768 --> 33:09.378
But the land was stolen

33:09.422 --> 33:12.120
during something called
the Yazoo land scandal.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.122
That was 1789, correct?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.211
I had to look it up, but yeah.

33:16.255 --> 33:19.910
So, Abner Fulham and a bunch of
other people had their land sold

33:19.954 --> 33:22.217
right out from under them
by Georgia's governor.

33:22.261 --> 33:24.176
Fast-forward to today.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.221
Abner's descendants are suing

33:26.265 --> 33:28.180
to reclaim what they say
is rightfully theirs.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.356
So, who owns the land now?

33:30.399 --> 33:33.272
A developer in Queens
named Chris Holland.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.230
I know that name.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.276
Yeah, you and the captain
spoke to him at the park

33:37.319 --> 33:38.277
the other day.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.278
He was one of the reenactors.

33:39.321 --> 33:40.670
A witness.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.281
HOLMES:
If my memory serves,

33:42.324 --> 33:45.153
he had several vague leads,
none of which panned out.

33:45.197 --> 33:48.200
I'm sure he was willing
to say anything to seem helpful.

33:48.243 --> 33:51.159
He didn't want you to figure out
he had just killed George Nix.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.121
[speaks indistinctly]

33:56.164 --> 33:57.209
Copy that, I'll let 'em know.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.253
Copy.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.216
What the hell is going on?

34:04.259 --> 34:06.653
Chris, I tried calling you.
They showed up an hour ago

34:06.696 --> 34:09.308
and they just started
searching everything.

34:09.351 --> 34:12.050
We're looking for the gun
you used to murder George Nix.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.746
BELL:
You want to see the warrant?

34:13.790 --> 34:15.444
It's right here.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.228
You think I killed
that guy in the park?

34:17.272 --> 34:19.621
Are you crazy?
I told you what I saw.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.275
You told me a story.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.973
You neglected to mention
your connection to the victim.

34:23.016 --> 34:24.888
WATSON: You own the deed
to a tract of land

34:24.931 --> 34:26.194
near Augusta,
Georgia, that sits

34:26.237 --> 34:27.369
on top of a lot
of natural gas.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.284
You might be able
to drill for it

34:29.328 --> 34:31.025
if the people who
actually own the land

34:31.069 --> 34:32.418
lose their suit against you.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.420
HOLMES:
Normally a claim so old

34:34.463 --> 34:35.985
would be tossed out of court
as specious,

34:36.030 --> 34:38.250
but there's plenty of evidence
in this case,

34:38.293 --> 34:41.469
as I'm sure your real estate
attorneys discovered.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.601
WATSON:
After they told you

34:42.645 --> 34:43.907
about the bounty land grant

34:43.951 --> 34:45.170
that George Nix
acquired at auction,

34:45.213 --> 34:47.128
you tried to buy it from him.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.998
I bet he would've sold it
to you if he knew

34:49.043 --> 34:51.437
the counteroffer was going to be
a bullet to his chest.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.830
Chris, say something.

34:53.873 --> 34:56.137
Look, I already did.
This is crazy.BELL: No.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.444
Your phone records show
you made multiple calls

34:58.487 --> 35:00.141
to Nix two weeks ago.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.361
And according to your most
recent credit card statement,

35:02.404 --> 35:04.450
you bought a rifle ten days ago.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.974
WATSON: You had it custom-fitted
with a wooden stock

35:07.017 --> 35:09.107
so it would look
like the other colonial muskets

35:09.150 --> 35:10.456
that were gonna be at the park.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.458
Honey...
Don't.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.460
So, if I'm hearing you right,

35:14.503 --> 35:18.203
I am guilty of using my phone
and buying a gun.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.988
Last time I checked, both
those things are legal.

35:21.031 --> 35:24.209
You don't have any proof
and you're not gonna find any.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.559
We'll see about that.

35:34.262 --> 35:37.047
No fun when the murderer
is right, is it?

35:47.449 --> 35:48.842
This is infuriating.
There's no doubt in my mind

35:48.885 --> 35:50.235
that Chris Holland
killed George Nix

35:50.278 --> 35:51.410
and then burned down his house.

35:51.453 --> 35:53.151
I keep going back to the gun.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.935
The .308 that
he must have retrofitted

35:54.978 --> 35:56.589
to look like a colonial musket.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.199
Me, too.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
Didn't turn up at his house
or his office.

36:00.201 --> 36:02.160
It wasn't left
on the battlefield.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.553
I mean, half the NYPD
combed over that park.

36:04.597 --> 36:07.165
It would've been found.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.645
He must've taken it somewhere
and then chucked it,

36:09.689 --> 36:11.081
but how did he get it away

36:11.125 --> 36:12.648
from the scene in
the first place?

36:12.692 --> 36:14.911
When you and the
captain spoke to him,

36:14.955 --> 36:17.218
he had a different gun.
A fake one, right?

36:17.262 --> 36:18.959
He had a very
small window

36:19.002 --> 36:20.178
to make the swap.

36:20.221 --> 36:24.007
Perhaps the when
will tell us the where.

36:24.051 --> 36:29.143
The first 911 call regarding
the shooting was at 8:52 a.m.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.754
Officers arrived on the scene
9:04. The responding officers

36:31.798 --> 36:34.061
took names of all the men
who were near George Nix

36:34.104 --> 36:36.106
when he died.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.891
Chris Holland
was on that list.

36:37.934 --> 36:38.892
That gives him
very little time

36:38.935 --> 36:40.459
to dispose of the murder weapon

36:40.502 --> 36:42.939
and replace it
with a fake musket.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.246
What about the portable toilets?

36:45.290 --> 36:47.205
There are a bunch
on the edge of the park.

36:47.248 --> 36:48.684
I mean, I know the police
checked them,

36:48.728 --> 36:50.120
but how closely do you think
they really looked?

36:50.164 --> 36:52.340
Especially after Holland
floated that story

36:52.384 --> 36:54.951
about the killer fleeing
in a white van.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.998
So, he puts the real gun
in the latrine

36:58.041 --> 36:59.478
and then returns with a fake one

36:59.521 --> 37:01.262
to play the part
of innocent bystander.

37:01.306 --> 37:05.440
Certainly repellent,
but no more than murder.

37:05.484 --> 37:08.226
I'll call the toilet
rental company,

37:08.269 --> 37:09.749
find out where they
empty their tanks.

37:09.792 --> 37:12.404
Maybe we'll get lucky
and wrap this thing up.

37:12.447 --> 37:16.103
This might be my last case
for several months.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.061
Why?

37:18.105 --> 37:21.064
Dr. Hanson has reiterated
his recommendation

37:21.108 --> 37:22.631
that I take more time off.

37:22.675 --> 37:25.243
Total peace and quiet

37:25.286 --> 37:27.332
might be my best chance
at a quick recovery.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.683
In fact, it might be
the only way I overcome PCS.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.641
How do you feel about that?

37:32.685 --> 37:34.817
Conflicted.

37:34.861 --> 37:37.777
I've always found what we do
quite curative.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.692
I feel I am at my best
when I'm working,

37:39.735 --> 37:41.302
so it seems
counterintuitive

37:41.346 --> 37:45.306
to think that that might be
what's doing me harm.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.265
I can't imagine taking
the amount of time off

37:47.308 --> 37:48.440
that he suggested.

37:48.483 --> 37:49.876
Well, maybe you
should talk to him.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.399
See if you can start smaller.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.227
We've gone a week or two
between cases.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.360
It happens.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.927
I mean, you've always seemed
to manage your downtime.

37:57.971 --> 38:00.843
By boxing, sparring
with my singlestick, reading,

38:00.887 --> 38:02.802
my pastimes are many.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.892
Those that aren't strictly
prohibited by my condition

38:05.935 --> 38:08.503
are made more difficult.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.071
Maybe take a week off?

38:11.114 --> 38:14.161
If it goes well, then
you can push it longer.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.032
Excrement.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.208
Okay, well, maybe it's
not such a great idea.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.906
Not your idea.

38:19.949 --> 38:21.386
You were quite close.

38:21.429 --> 38:27.174
The answer we're looking
for might lie in excrement,

38:27.217 --> 38:29.132
just not the kind
you were imagining.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.788
Take it in, Chris.

38:32.832 --> 38:35.313
It's the center
of your undoing.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.227
Is this a joke?

38:37.271 --> 38:39.360
What, you guys didn't find
anything at my house yesterday.

38:39.404 --> 38:41.057
Now what? You're gonna
use my cat's litter box

38:41.101 --> 38:43.190
to prove I killed George Nix?

38:43.233 --> 38:44.844
No, but we are going to use it

38:44.887 --> 38:47.020
to prove that you
burned down his house.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.282
HOLMES:
Cat litter

38:48.326 --> 38:50.023
is mostly sodium bentonite.

38:50.066 --> 38:53.113
It's an extremely absorbent clay
made from volcanic ash.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.376
It's so absorbent,
in fact,

38:55.420 --> 38:57.204
that arson investigators
use it to trap moisture

38:57.247 --> 38:58.640
which might be left
at crime scenes.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.513
BELL: It can be
tested to identify

39:01.556 --> 39:04.385
the exact chemical fingerprint
of whatever accelerant

39:04.429 --> 39:06.082
was used to start a fire.

39:06.126 --> 39:07.910
Gasoline, for example.

39:07.954 --> 39:10.522
Or in your case, a mixture
of napalm B and thermite.

39:10.565 --> 39:13.176
HOLMES: Yesterday when we spent
time in your lovely home,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.613
it became obvious
where you would've brewed

39:14.656 --> 39:16.310
that particular cocktail.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.267
The garage.

39:17.311 --> 39:19.313
Has a workbench,
two sinks,

39:19.357 --> 39:20.662
plenty of privacy.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.751
It's the perfect spot

39:22.795 --> 39:24.057
for, uh, illicit
home chemistry.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.406
BELL:
Problem is, it's also

39:25.450 --> 39:27.887
the perfect place
for a litter box.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.845
We stopped by your house
this morning

39:29.889 --> 39:31.978
after you left for work.
All above board.

39:32.021 --> 39:35.155
We got an amended warrant
for a second search.

39:35.198 --> 39:38.680
Residue in your kitty litter
is an identical match

39:38.724 --> 39:41.379
for the accelerant that was
used at George Nix's home.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.381
We can prove you started
the fire.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.645
So, you're gonna charge me
with arson?

39:46.688 --> 39:48.298
Nobody was hurt in that fire.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.301
A guy like me does what? A year?

39:51.345 --> 39:54.566
No. You'll be in
a lot longer than that.

39:54.609 --> 39:57.307
We're gonna find the gun
you used to shoot George.

39:57.351 --> 39:59.353
WATSON: We're pretty sure
you stashed it

39:59.397 --> 40:02.574
in one of the portable toilets
on the edge of the park.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.314
I've got guys headed over
to the company

40:04.358 --> 40:05.968
that provided those toilets
right this minute.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.405
But I'll tell you what.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.536
If I were you,

40:08.580 --> 40:11.191
I'd confess now.

40:11.234 --> 40:13.280
'Cause if you don't

40:13.323 --> 40:15.195
and you make a few dozen cops

40:15.238 --> 40:18.720
dig through a mountain of
literal crap to find your gun,

40:18.764 --> 40:21.331
I guarantee you

40:21.375 --> 40:23.421
you'll be facing
the least friendly prosecution

40:23.464 --> 40:24.987
in the history

40:25.031 --> 40:26.554
of the New York
judicial system.

40:26.598 --> 40:29.339
[sighs]

40:33.866 --> 40:35.998
That's an industrial size
cup of coffee.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.826
Caffeine and gabapentin

40:37.870 --> 40:40.220
are fighting a war
in my neural cortex.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.440
You wanted to talk?

40:42.483 --> 40:45.486
Yeah. I was thinking about the
things you said the other day,

40:45.530 --> 40:47.183
the problems you've been having,

40:47.227 --> 40:50.273
and, uh, I thought
I might have a way to help.

40:50.317 --> 40:52.406
Well, if you're about
to suggest an extended holiday,

40:52.450 --> 40:53.712
someone's beaten you to it.

40:53.755 --> 40:55.235
What do you mean?

40:55.278 --> 40:57.237
My doctor says I need
to take time off.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.282
And that I should continue
to medicate myself.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.327
Can you do that?

41:00.370 --> 41:01.807
Just take time off?

41:01.850 --> 41:03.548
I mean, it's not like
the bad guys take a break.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.463
Not my favorite solution.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.116
You have another?

41:07.160 --> 41:12.078
Um, I don't know if it's
a solution, but yeah.

41:12.121 --> 41:13.514
You know how much
my work means to me

41:13.558 --> 41:16.038
and how I use it
to distract myself.

41:16.082 --> 41:17.736
I do. I also know that

41:17.779 --> 41:20.260
you shouldn't pin
your sobriety on anything.

41:20.303 --> 41:23.481
You could get fired.
Your company could go under.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.831
Yeah.

41:25.874 --> 41:30.270
Yeah, point is, uh, there's this
girl I know from the program.

41:30.313 --> 41:32.315
She always goes
to the same meetings

41:32.359 --> 41:34.840
like clockwork, for years.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.537
Last Tuesday,
she doesn't show up

41:36.581 --> 41:38.496
to the 7:00 p.m.
at St. Olaf's.

41:38.539 --> 41:42.500
Then she doesn't show up
to the Thursday meeting.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.502
So, I reach out to her sponsor,

41:44.545 --> 41:48.506
and it turns out she hasn't
even been showing up to work.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.943
I don't know.
I'm just worried about her.

41:50.986 --> 41:53.467
You want me to look for her?

41:53.511 --> 41:55.382
Yeah, I would feel better
knowing she's okay.

41:55.425 --> 41:56.426
I mean, I just...

41:58.124 --> 42:01.344
I thought
it might help you, too.

42:01.388 --> 42:05.653

bad, bad omen. â™ª
