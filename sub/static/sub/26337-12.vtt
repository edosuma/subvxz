00:17.155 --> 00:18.259
you know I mean?

at an Italian delicacy.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.609

00:26.060 --> 00:28.304
do spaghetti in a dessert.

00:28.407 --> 00:30.547
NARRATOR: Left guestjudge Valerie Gordon cold.

00:30.651 --> 00:32.101
Ooh.

00:32.204 --> 00:35.000
Beyond undercooked,
just not really cooked.

So sorry, I fucked up, man.

00:37.623 --> 00:40.005
NARRATOR: And Trevor'stake on a healthy dessert.

00:40.109 --> 00:41.351
These are avocado kisses.

00:41.455 --> 00:43.319
This is my take on superfood.

00:43.422 --> 00:44.872
NARRATOR: Fared even worse.

00:44.975 --> 00:46.770
I really dislike this dish.

00:46.874 --> 00:47.875
It tastes like a bush.

00:47.978 --> 00:48.772
Wow.

00:48.876 --> 00:49.980
NARRATOR: A high score for Ariel

00:50.084 --> 00:51.085
VALERIE GORDON:
There's something

00:51.189 --> 00:52.638
very smart about this.

00:52.742 --> 00:53.536
This is a four.

00:53.639 --> 00:54.778
Thank you, chef.

[clapping]

NARRATOR: At dinner service.

01:02.303 --> 01:03.856

Really?

01:05.168 --> 01:06.963
NARRATOR: Heather struggledon the meat station.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.828
In the real world,
you get fired for this.

01:09.931 --> 01:11.830
NARRATOR: And Kanae
dragged her salmon.

01:11.933 --> 01:12.969
This is raw.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.729
Leave me fucking alone.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.593
NARRATOR: But luckily
for them, their mistakes

01:16.697 --> 01:17.767
were overshadowed.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.287
Your pan's filthy
fucking dirty.

01:20.390 --> 01:22.599
NARRATOR: By Bret's
troubles with fish.

01:22.703 --> 01:24.222
GORDON RAMSEY: The
salmon is ice cold.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.396
Worse than that, the
lady is pregnant.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.985
NARRATOR: And Trevor's breakdown on the meat station.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.504
Fucking lamb's overcooked.

01:30.607 --> 01:32.816
This is like one
of my nightmares.

01:32.920 --> 01:36.682
That's the biggest
fucking insult. Get out!

01:36.786 --> 01:39.271
NARRATOR: The red team
lost, and Bret and Trev

01:39.375 --> 01:40.721
were put up for elimination.

01:40.824 --> 01:41.687
I cooked my heart out.

01:41.791 --> 01:42.826
This is a lifestyle for me.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.380
At least I'm not
a one-trick pony.

01:44.483 --> 01:45.622
This is my life.

01:45.726 --> 01:47.521
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay
said goodbye to.

01:47.624 --> 01:48.936
Trev.

01:49.039 --> 01:51.318
NARRATOR: Ending his chancesof becoming the executive chef

01:51.421 --> 01:53.423
at Gordon Ramsay'sHell's Kitchen restaurant

01:53.527 --> 01:56.116
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

01:56.219 --> 01:58.670
But with only two men
left on the red team,

01:58.773 --> 02:01.121
Chef Ramsay made a
request of the women.

02:01.224 --> 02:03.709
Which one of you
will emerge as a leader

02:03.813 --> 02:06.022
and jump in to the red team?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.023
Now, piss off.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.577
Chef.

02:09.681 --> 02:12.132
NARRATOR: And now, the
continuation of "Hell's

02:12.235 --> 02:13.409
Kitchen."

02:13.512 --> 02:14.444
ARIEL FOX: What's up, Mia?

02:14.548 --> 02:15.894
Not much.

02:15.997 --> 02:17.067
ARIEL FOX: I'm
about to volunteer

02:17.171 --> 02:18.483
to come over the red side

02:18.586 --> 02:19.518
I wanted to volunteer.

02:19.622 --> 02:20.899
- Do you?
- Yeah.

02:21.002 --> 02:22.245
- OK.
- I do.

02:22.349 --> 02:24.592
Chef has been telling me,like, I want you to step up.

02:24.696 --> 02:26.180
And I want to step up.

02:26.284 --> 02:27.285
OK.

02:27.388 --> 02:28.941
I feel like you're
the leader in the blue,

02:29.045 --> 02:31.116
and I kind of want
to lead as well,

02:31.220 --> 02:32.635
and I want to show
him that like.

02:32.738 --> 02:33.567
OK.

02:33.670 --> 02:34.637
That I can lead.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.017
If that's what you
really, really want.

02:36.121 --> 02:37.329
- I want
- I will respect that.

02:37.433 --> 02:38.710
I want it bad.

02:38.813 --> 02:39.676
I want it really bad.

02:39.780 --> 02:40.781
All right, cool.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.058
MIA CASTRO: Thank you.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.715
I'm going to be finewhether I'm on the blue team

02:43.818 --> 02:44.888
or the red team.

02:44.992 --> 02:46.649
If it was anyone else,
the answer would be no.

02:46.752 --> 02:49.238
But it feels the best
when you beat the best.

02:49.341 --> 02:51.378
Now it's going to be yourkitchen versus my kitchen.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.865
[music playing]

03:28.277 --> 03:29.795
GORDON RAMSEY: Line up.

03:29.899 --> 03:30.693
Good morning.

03:30.796 --> 03:32.039
Good morning, Chef.

03:32.142 --> 03:33.282
- Bret, you good?
- Yes, chef.

03:33.385 --> 03:34.490
GORDON RAMSEY: Ready
to bounce back?

03:34.593 --> 03:35.456
Absolutely, Chef.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.390
Look at those four
talented ladies.

03:38.494 --> 03:40.530
Who would be the
dream pick to help

03:40.634 --> 03:42.670
get the red team to success?

03:42.774 --> 03:43.706
I got gotta say Ariel, Chef.

03:43.809 --> 03:44.914
GORDON RAMSEY: Why?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.467
I feel like she's the
best one on that team

03:46.571 --> 03:48.228
and she could do
right by the red.

03:48.331 --> 03:49.194
GORDON RAMSEY: Interesting.

03:49.298 --> 03:52.473
Who is going over
to the red team?

03:52.577 --> 03:54.406
I actually originally
volunteered, Chef.

03:54.510 --> 03:55.442
GORDON RAMSEY: OK.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.306
But Mia and I had
a great conversation

03:57.409 --> 04:00.964
last night about her steppinginto a leadership role.

04:01.068 --> 04:03.173
And I actually wouldlike a challenge tonight,

04:03.277 --> 04:05.279
so I thought it
would be cool for her

04:05.383 --> 04:08.178
to find her voice over thereand give us a challenge tonight.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.145
GORDON RAMSEY: Great.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.734
Young lady, here we go.

04:11.837 --> 04:12.907
CHRIS MOTTO: All right, Mia.

04:13.011 --> 04:13.874
Good, excellent.

04:13.977 --> 04:14.771
Thank you, Chef.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.186
Back in red.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.604
You know, Mia, she did notcome to the red team to lead.

04:19.707 --> 04:23.193
She may think that, but notwith me standing next to her,

04:23.297 --> 04:24.885
she ain't.

04:24.988 --> 04:27.405
GORDON RAMSEY: Now, during yourjourney here at Hell's Kitchen,

04:27.508 --> 04:29.648
you've gained a great
deal of knowledge,

04:29.752 --> 04:33.480
not just from me, but fromthe many excellent guest

04:33.583 --> 04:35.896
chefs that we've had here.

04:35.999 --> 04:39.209
Five of those incredible
chefs are behind me.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.073
Traci Des Jardins.

04:41.177 --> 04:43.559
You always want to balance,you a little bit of acid,

04:43.662 --> 04:45.664
salt, a little bit
of texture on there.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.494
That's the ideal soup.

04:47.597 --> 04:48.736
GORDON RAMSEY: David Lefevere.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.255
Be careful how much you'remarinating it with soy,

04:50.359 --> 04:52.084
because what soy has,
that salt can do,

04:52.188 --> 04:53.776
is it can draw some of themoisture out of the fish

04:53.879 --> 04:55.467
that's already pretty lean.

04:55.571 --> 04:56.882
GORDON RAMSEY: Shirley Chung.

04:56.986 --> 04:58.505
Chinese cuisine
has this thing that,

04:58.608 --> 05:00.886
you want all the
shapes match, but you

05:00.990 --> 05:03.268
have big chunk of chicken.

05:03.372 --> 05:05.166
GORDON RAMSEY: Richard Blais.

05:05.270 --> 05:08.308
Sometimes people are beautifulin jeans and a T-shirt.

05:08.411 --> 05:10.551
They don't need to get dressedup and wear fancy suits.

05:10.655 --> 05:13.589
I wanted more jeans and
a T-shirt in this dish.

05:13.692 --> 05:15.970
GORDON RAMSEY: And
Valerie Gordon.

05:16.074 --> 05:17.765
I think the concept
was interesting,

05:17.869 --> 05:20.941
but the idea might be great.

05:21.044 --> 05:23.461
The experience might not be.

05:23.564 --> 05:26.671
Part of the reason
that the six of you

05:26.774 --> 05:28.431
have arrived at this
stage in the competition

05:28.535 --> 05:32.573
is not because you've taken inknowledge, you are using it.

05:32.677 --> 05:37.095
But now is the time tomove on to the next level.

05:37.198 --> 05:41.444
My question is, which of youare going to break through.

05:41.548 --> 05:42.859
[breaking glass]

05:42.963 --> 05:44.654
Oh, my god.

05:44.758 --> 05:45.621
Scaring me.

05:45.724 --> 05:46.553
Wow.

05:46.656 --> 05:47.899
MIA CASTRO: I'm like, what?

05:48.002 --> 05:51.385
And then I look up and I'mlike, ah, black jacket.

05:51.489 --> 05:56.735
There are six of you andonly five black jackets.

05:56.839 --> 06:00.532
The chefs who will receive thecoveted black jacket today,

06:00.636 --> 06:03.328
are the ones who aremost successful at facing

06:03.432 --> 06:06.296
three difficult challenges.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.781
MIA CASTRO: I'm
not going to lie,

06:07.884 --> 06:11.785
and bummed that I don't getto whip these guys into shape.

06:11.888 --> 06:14.960
The two chefs with the bestdishes in the first round

06:15.064 --> 06:16.617
will receive black jackets.

06:16.721 --> 06:21.311
The remaining chefs will competein a second big challenge.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.279
Finally, there'll be
one more challenge,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.350
and that will be the
final opportunity

06:25.454 --> 06:27.145
to receive a black jacket.

06:27.248 --> 06:28.042
Is that clear?

06:28.146 --> 06:29.147
Yes, Chef.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.251
Good.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.046
Are you ready for
your first challenge?

06:32.150 --> 06:33.427
Yes, Chef.

06:33.531 --> 06:37.120
Waiters, please
bring in our first box.

06:37.224 --> 06:38.536
Oh, no.

06:38.639 --> 06:40.814
GORDON RAMSEY: Just as you allare hoping to break through

06:40.917 --> 06:44.542
to black jacket status, you allwill break through the front

06:44.645 --> 06:47.407
of this case to
retrieve ingredients

06:47.510 --> 06:49.616
for your first big challenge.

06:49.719 --> 06:52.998
As you can see, case
number one is protein.

06:53.102 --> 06:55.829
There are three
additional cases.

06:55.932 --> 07:00.420
Vegetables, starch
and a wildcard.

07:00.523 --> 07:02.663
You'll take all
those ingredients

07:02.767 --> 07:05.114
and create a stunning dish.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.150
Everybody ready to punchthrough for a black jacket?

07:07.254 --> 07:08.497
Yes, Chef.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.983
GORDON RAMSEY: Good, let'sstart off with Bret, please.

07:12.086 --> 07:13.605
Pick up your basket.

07:13.709 --> 07:15.020
Take your time.

07:15.124 --> 07:17.160
I don't want you
to break a knuckle.

07:17.264 --> 07:18.576
[loud rip]

07:18.679 --> 07:20.094
Bam.

07:20.198 --> 07:21.337
Give me my protein.

Pork chop, Chef.

07:22.338 --> 07:23.132
GORDON RAMSEY: Excellent.

07:31.312 --> 07:32.555
or something back
there that's going

07:32.659 --> 07:33.522
to bite the shit out of me.

07:33.625 --> 07:34.419

07:34.523 --> 07:35.662

But, I think I would handle thatbetter than anybody else here.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.702

07:45.534 --> 07:47.156
I will take that.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.329
Mia, let's go.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.297
I'm punching the black
jacket, because that's

07:50.400 --> 07:51.332
what I'm getting today.

07:51.436 --> 07:53.714

08:00.859 --> 08:03.621
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Yeah!

now secured a protein.

08:10.386 --> 08:11.421
[loud rip]

08:11.525 --> 08:13.872
And must punch through

08:31.580 --> 08:32.442
[loud rip]

08:32.546 --> 08:33.374
Polenta, Chef

08:33.478 --> 08:34.272
Polenta.

08:35.653 --> 08:36.895
Polenta!

08:36.999 --> 08:39.242
I cook it all the time.

08:39.346 --> 08:41.969
I love polenta in
all of its forms.

08:42.073 --> 08:43.177
Merry Christmas, Bret.

08:43.281 --> 08:44.696
Happy Hanukkah, Chef, thank you.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.180
NARRATOR: Finally,

08:46.284 --> 08:48.907
get one wildcard ingredientto complete their basket.

08:49.011 --> 08:49.874

08:49.977 --> 08:52.773
Ooh, black truffle.

Dried porcini.

08:56.881 --> 08:57.675

Some whisky, Chef.

08:59.746 --> 09:00.574
[loud rip]

09:00.678 --> 09:02.921
Duck fat, OK.

09:03.025 --> 09:05.303
[loud rip]

09:05.406 --> 09:06.615
I got some bacon.

09:06.718 --> 09:07.512
Oh.

09:07.616 --> 09:08.409
[loud rip]

09:08.513 --> 09:09.583
GORDON RAMSEY: And?

09:09.687 --> 09:10.826
Some butter?

09:10.929 --> 09:12.103
Mascarpone.
Cream cheese.

09:12.206 --> 09:13.000
Sweet.

09:13.104 --> 09:13.932
Happy?

09:14.036 --> 09:15.451
Yeah, I'm thrilled, Chef.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.246
[laughter]

09:17.349 --> 09:21.250
One stunning dish usingfive incredible ingredients.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.218
Your 45 minutes starts now.

09:24.322 --> 09:26.255
Let's go.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.636
ARIEL FOX: At this
point in the game,

09:27.739 --> 09:30.570
we should all be able to doanything with anything we have.

09:30.673 --> 09:31.812
Where's my bacon fat?

09:31.916 --> 09:35.195
Nothing should be
sub-par at this point.

09:35.298 --> 09:37.818
OK, you have a little bitof a combination here, huh?

09:37.922 --> 09:39.233
Yeah, a little bit.

09:39.337 --> 09:40.994
A little Asian,
a little Italian.

09:41.097 --> 09:42.961
I think I'll be all right.

09:43.065 --> 09:44.998
It's that black
jacket on the line.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.241
This is the round where
I need to end this.

09:47.345 --> 09:49.761
Go big or go the fuck home!

09:49.865 --> 09:52.626
[music playing]

09:53.731 --> 09:54.939
Agh, really?

09:55.042 --> 09:56.526
I don't like duck!

09:56.630 --> 09:59.081
It's not my fucking
choice protein.

09:59.184 --> 10:02.705
But it's all about flavorand how you execute.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.328
I need to just put my headdown and cook my heart out.

10:05.432 --> 10:07.296
Ain't nothing but a
thing, chicken wing.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.746
- You dusted this with sugar?- Yeah.

10:08.849 --> 10:09.747
Yeah.

10:09.850 --> 10:10.989
You put the, what is that?Duck fat?

10:11.093 --> 10:12.094
- Yep.
- And salt?

10:12.197 --> 10:13.164
Yep.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.752
I feel strong going
into the challenge

10:14.855 --> 10:19.101
the same way I felt strong goinginto all the other challenges.

10:19.204 --> 10:21.034
I believe in myself to do it.

10:21.137 --> 10:22.483
You know, I've gotten this far.

10:22.587 --> 10:24.347
Why doubt myself now?

10:24.451 --> 10:25.486
You use that technique before?

10:25.590 --> 10:26.384
Yes.

10:26.487 --> 10:27.281
Smart.

10:27.385 --> 10:28.800
60 seconds to go.

10:28.904 --> 10:31.182
Let's get those
black jackets, baby.

10:31.285 --> 10:33.253
At 14, if I wouldn't haveleft because of my injury,

10:33.356 --> 10:35.151
I would have guaranteed
myself a black jacket,

10:35.255 --> 10:36.843
and even maybe a
spot in the finals.

10:36.946 --> 10:41.330
So I need that blackjacket, I'm coming for it.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.608
KANAE HOUSTON: Hell, yeah.

10:43.712 --> 10:45.127
GORDON RAMSEY: 15 seconds to go.

10:45.230 --> 10:47.577
VALERIE GORDON: Think
about that plating.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.269
BRET HAUSER: Plate
for a man pork chop.

10:49.372 --> 10:55.862
GORDON RAMSEY: 5, 4,
3, 2, 1, and serve.

10:55.965 --> 10:58.761
OK, well done.

10:58.865 --> 10:59.969
Let's start off with Heather.

11:00.073 --> 11:02.489
Let's go please.

11:02.592 --> 11:05.250
OK, describe your dish please.

11:05.354 --> 11:06.976
Chef, I have for
you a pan seared duck

11:07.080 --> 11:10.255
breast with a purple sweetpotato puree underneath,

11:10.359 --> 11:11.498
carrots and peas.

11:11.601 --> 11:12.568
OK.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.708
The excess juice,
where's that from?

11:14.812 --> 11:15.847
HEATHER WILLIAMS:
From the duck, I.

11:15.951 --> 11:16.917
OK.

11:17.021 --> 11:18.263
Did you let it rest
before you sliced?

11:18.367 --> 11:19.402
I did, but not
long enough, Chef.

11:19.506 --> 11:20.369
Not long enough.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.026
Why's this puree
so sort of gummy?

11:22.129 --> 11:23.096
What'd you do with that?

11:23.199 --> 11:25.546
HEATHER WILLIAMS: I
put it in the Vitamix.

11:25.650 --> 11:28.998
Heather, why?

11:29.102 --> 11:31.311
Why?

11:31.414 --> 11:33.693
[music playing]

11:36.696 --> 11:39.560
NARRATOR: In the first today'sthree black jacket challenges.

11:39.664 --> 11:40.630
Lamb, Chef.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.425
NARRATOR: Each chef
had to create a dish

11:42.529 --> 11:44.600
using randomly
selected ingredients.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.568
The two chefs with the bestdishes in the first round

11:47.672 --> 11:48.949
will receive black jackets.

11:49.053 --> 11:51.538
NARRATOR: And veteran, Heather,has presented Chef Ramsay

11:51.641 --> 11:53.989
with a pan seared duck
breast and purple potato

11:54.092 --> 11:55.922
puree, which has him asking.

11:56.025 --> 11:57.509
Why's this puree
so sort of gummy?

11:57.613 --> 11:58.441
What'd you do with that?

11:58.545 --> 11:59.580
I put it in the Vitamix.

11:59.684 --> 12:00.478
GORDON RAMSEY: Why?

12:00.581 --> 12:01.824
Why?

12:01.928 --> 12:04.102
Heather, did you taste this?

12:04.206 --> 12:05.483
I did, Chef,
before I put it on.

12:05.586 --> 12:08.417
GORDON RAMSEY: Here.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.522
Yeah, not your best effort.

12:10.626 --> 12:11.972
No, it's not, Chef.

12:12.076 --> 12:14.423
Thank you.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.012
This dish is a bit
of a mess, Heather,

12:17.115 --> 12:19.083
exactly like your jacket.

12:21.982 --> 12:23.501
BRET HAUSER: Word, that'sone person I don't have

12:23.604 --> 12:24.502
to worry about on this round.

12:28.195 --> 12:29.852
Kanae, let's go please.

12:29.956 --> 12:31.647
NARRATOR: Rookie
Kanae is next up,

12:31.751 --> 12:34.339
with her potato crustedlamb, glazed string beans,

12:34.443 --> 12:35.858
and asparagus puree.

12:35.962 --> 12:38.654
GORDON RAMSEY: You've gotsuch delicate, dainty flavors.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.175
But then I come to this unwantedcrunch with these raw beans.

12:42.278 --> 12:45.626
So it destroys the texturesthat you built the dish on.

12:45.730 --> 12:46.524
But it's a good effort.

12:46.627 --> 12:47.421
Thank you, Chef.

12:47.525 --> 12:48.388
GORDON RAMSEY: Thank you.

12:48.491 --> 12:49.492
BRET HAUSER: Hell, yeah, next.

12:49.596 --> 12:50.597
Another one gone.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.943
GORDON RAMSEY: Next, Motto.

12:52.047 --> 12:53.186
Here we go.

12:53.289 --> 12:56.499
Here I have a citrus glazedsalmon with crispy skin,

12:56.603 --> 12:58.122
with a brown
mascarpone gremolata.

12:58.225 --> 12:59.571
GORDON RAMSEY: Visually,
it looks beautiful.

12:59.675 --> 13:00.607
Love what you do with the skin.

13:00.710 --> 13:01.884
So you take the skin off?

13:01.988 --> 13:03.886
Yes, this was a first shot.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.750
GORDON RAMSEY:
What a smart idea.

13:05.854 --> 13:06.924
It's cooked beautifully.

13:10.341 --> 13:11.860
Mmm, very crispy, wow.

13:11.963 --> 13:13.102
What do I change?

13:13.206 --> 13:15.242
A little bit more seasoningand flavor in the rice.

13:15.346 --> 13:16.657
- OK.
- Thank you.

13:16.761 --> 13:17.797
[inaudible]

13:17.900 --> 13:19.660
GORDON RAMSEY: Up next, Ariel.- Yes, Chef.

13:19.764 --> 13:20.627

NARRATOR: Season
six veteran, Ariel,

13:22.146 --> 13:25.080
has prepared pan seared scallopswith bacon wrapped celery root.

13:25.183 --> 13:26.322
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

13:26.426 --> 13:28.600
I'm definitely feelingreally good about this dish.

13:28.704 --> 13:32.881
I just want that first blackjacket, just give it to me.

13:32.984 --> 13:34.020
Did you use all
the ingredients?

13:34.123 --> 13:35.021
Yes, Chef.

13:35.124 --> 13:38.093
And I confited the
celery root cubes

13:38.196 --> 13:39.957
before I wrapped them in bacon.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.544
GORDON RAMSEY: Scallops
are cooked beautifully.

13:41.648 --> 13:43.063
Love what you did
with the celery root.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.031
You've done something
pretty magical.

13:45.134 --> 13:47.861
The only thing that doesn't workon there is the fried leaves.

13:47.965 --> 13:48.931
OK.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.001
But I think it's
one of your strongest.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.416
Thank you, Chef.
GORDON RAMSEY: Good job.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.693
Thank you.

and Swiss chard couscous.

14:01.702 --> 14:04.636
GORDON RAMSEY: You plate
like an absolute pro.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.915
For me, it's all
about the temperature.

14:07.018 --> 14:08.640
What have we got in there?MIA CASTRO: Medium rare.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.056
GORDON RAMSEY: Medium rare.MIA CASTRO: Yes, Chef.

14:10.159 --> 14:11.402
How do you know?

14:11.505 --> 14:12.921
Because I cooked it, Chef.

14:13.024 --> 14:14.992
I know it's medium
rare, I'm a chef!

14:15.095 --> 14:16.925
And I cooked it.

14:17.028 --> 14:21.205
GORDON RAMSEY: That
is a perfect mid rare.

14:21.308 --> 14:23.552
I mean, it is
absolutely spot on.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.174
A touch less reduction
in the sauce.

14:25.278 --> 14:26.727
It's a very heavy,
very powerful.

14:26.831 --> 14:28.419
It's a tough one to get right.Great job.

14:28.522 --> 14:29.558
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.662

chop, creamy polenta,

14:36.737 --> 14:38.153
and oven roasted sunchokes.

14:38.256 --> 14:40.189
Wanted to go kind of mansexy with the whiskey and

14:40.293 --> 14:41.535
the double bone and pork chop.

14:41.639 --> 14:43.675
GORDON RAMSEY: Oh, stop there.

14:43.779 --> 14:45.574
Man sexy, what does that mean?

14:45.677 --> 14:46.989
Just looks like
a man plate, Chef.

14:47.093 --> 14:47.887
A man plate?

14:47.990 --> 14:48.957
Right.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.924
The double bone pork
chop, the whiskey.

14:51.028 --> 14:51.821
[gagging]

14:51.925 --> 14:52.719
Bret, sexy.

14:52.822 --> 14:55.066
[gagging]

14:55.170 --> 14:56.826
I wouldn't say it looks sexy.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.138
A tad anemic in terms of color.

14:58.242 --> 14:59.312
Harsh.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.107
GORDON RAMSEY: I love
the sear on the chop.

15:04.075 --> 15:05.180
It's delicious.

15:05.283 --> 15:08.459
When you've got such a
hearty stunning protein,

15:08.562 --> 15:09.874
rein in the garnish
a little bit.

15:09.978 --> 15:11.220

Thank you Chef.

15:39.662 --> 15:43.149
And I am feeling super, superpumped to be here right now.

15:43.252 --> 15:48.188
The second recipient, thiswas a difficult decision,

15:48.292 --> 15:54.263
but the jacket goes to Mia.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.782
Great job.

15:55.885 --> 15:57.473

15:57.577 --> 16:00.580
I made it, I made it.

16:00.683 --> 16:01.546
Well done

16:01.650 --> 16:02.892
I look the best in black.

16:02.996 --> 16:03.893
It makes me look slimmer.

16:06.586 --> 16:07.794
- Please come in.
- Oh, my gosh.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.106

Yeah!

16:15.871 --> 16:17.252
Oh, my god.

16:17.355 --> 16:18.908
Here's a chocolate fountain.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.152
Don't mind if I do.

16:21.256 --> 16:23.810
I could not have
picked a better scenario

16:23.913 --> 16:26.330
than it being
myself and Mia being

16:26.433 --> 16:27.607
the first two black jackets.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.436
You're just going
to go like a savage.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.886
Go in like a savage.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.301
Ya, filthy animal.

16:32.405 --> 16:34.752
I'm just super happy thatwe're both here right now.

16:34.855 --> 16:35.995
Congratulations.

16:36.098 --> 16:37.824
Congratulations to makingit to the black jackets.

16:37.927 --> 16:38.721
Yes.

16:38.825 --> 16:40.137
Cheers.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.382
Right, time for
challenge number two

16:44.486 --> 16:49.629
and the opportunity for two ofyou to earn your black jackets.

16:49.732 --> 16:55.462
As chefs, one of the qualitiesthat truly makes us stand out,

16:55.566 --> 16:57.844
is our creativity.

16:57.947 --> 16:59.190
It's always
interesting to see what

16:59.294 --> 17:03.539
different chefs will do withthe same ingredients, right?

17:03.643 --> 17:04.575
Yes Chef.

17:04.678 --> 17:05.990
GORDON RAMSEY: OK,
listen carefully.

17:06.094 --> 17:09.407
You will each take a
turn spinning this wheel

17:09.511 --> 17:12.169
to choose a protein,
two vegetables

17:12.272 --> 17:14.826
and a wild card ingredient.

17:14.930 --> 17:17.726
Whatever the wheel lands onwill determine the ingredients

17:17.829 --> 17:19.693
you will all be using.

17:19.797 --> 17:20.798
Heather.
- Yes, Chef.

17:20.901 --> 17:22.213
GORDON RAMSEY: You're up first.

17:22.317 --> 17:23.111
OK.

17:25.423 --> 17:29.186
GORDON RAMSEY: OK,
big, strong turn.

17:29.289 --> 17:30.566
Here we go.

17:30.670 --> 17:42.509
The protein that all four ofyou will be using is quail.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.822
Now that is a tough bird.

17:44.925 --> 17:46.617
Kanae, you enjoy quail?

17:46.720 --> 17:48.308
Uh-huh, I like quail.

17:48.412 --> 17:49.861
I can tell.

17:49.965 --> 17:51.518
I can do a lot with quail.

17:51.622 --> 17:53.002
I can work with some quail.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.384
I perfected it in
culinary school,

17:55.488 --> 17:57.041
so this is going to be fun.

17:57.145 --> 17:58.180
GORDON RAMSEY:
Heather, thank you.

17:58.284 --> 17:58.905
HEATHER WILLIAMS:
You're welcome, Chef.

17:59.008 --> 18:00.044
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

18:00.148 --> 18:02.426
I've never cooked
quail in my life.

18:02.529 --> 18:04.635
GORDON RAMSEY: Motto,
you've got the spin

18:04.738 --> 18:06.223
for the first vegetables.

18:11.020 --> 18:13.264
Eggplant, nice.

18:13.368 --> 18:14.231
Ooh, way.

18:14.334 --> 18:16.336
I cook with it all the time.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.235
And it's tattooed on me.

18:18.338 --> 18:21.893
Right there is theeggplant with the mussels.

18:21.997 --> 18:23.343
GORDON RAMSEY: Second vegetable.

18:23.447 --> 18:26.174
Kanae, let's go.

18:26.277 --> 18:29.315
Here we go.

18:29.418 --> 18:31.213
Baby leeks.

18:31.317 --> 18:34.768
Bret, we need a
wildcard ingredient,

18:34.872 --> 18:41.603
the last element of your
dish is cauliflower.

18:41.706 --> 18:42.500
That's challenging.

18:42.604 --> 18:44.123
Thank you, Bret.

18:44.226 --> 18:46.780
We are not having much
success tonight, are we?

18:46.884 --> 18:48.713
This dish sounds a nightmare.

18:48.817 --> 18:51.613
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Great,
a three Michelin star

18:51.716 --> 18:53.062
chef doesn't even
know what the fuck

18:53.166 --> 18:54.478
to do with these ingredients.

18:54.581 --> 18:58.033
Your 45 minutes starts now.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.655
Good luck, because
you're going to need it.

18:59.759 --> 19:02.555
[music playing]

19:08.043 --> 19:09.493
NARRATOR: Veteran,
Ariel and rookie,

19:09.596 --> 19:12.358
Mia, are enjoying their timein the exclusive black jacket

19:12.461 --> 19:13.566
lounge.
- Cheers.

19:13.669 --> 19:14.222
Cheers.

19:14.325 --> 19:14.808
Congratulations.

19:14.912 --> 19:15.809
You too.

19:15.913 --> 19:16.776
NARRATOR: Meanwhile.

19:16.879 --> 19:20.055
Your 45 minutes starts now.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.230
Good luck, because
you're going to need it.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.335
NARRATOR: In the second
black jacket challenge,

19:24.439 --> 19:26.889
the remaining chefs
have 45 minutes

19:26.993 --> 19:29.616
to create a unique
dish, all using

19:29.720 --> 19:31.618
the same four ingredients.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.828
Quail, cauliflower,
baby leeks and eggplant.

19:34.932 --> 19:35.967
BRET HAUSER: Let's
get 'em, Motto.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.969
I don't want to see you
in the lounge, brother.

19:38.073 --> 19:39.730
Let's go, man.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.697
I don't think I have to
over-complicate this.

19:41.801 --> 19:44.010
If I can pull this quailoff, then I'm going to be

19:44.113 --> 19:47.358
wearing a black jacket later.

19:47.462 --> 19:48.463
Nice.

19:48.566 --> 19:49.809
I started with
the cauliflower,

19:49.912 --> 19:51.500
because I knew right awaywhat I wanted to do with that.

19:51.604 --> 19:53.364
Then I wanted to
salt my eggplant.

19:53.468 --> 19:55.332
Then I stopped and
looked at the quail.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.092
I ain't worked with
quail in a long time.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.714
I know it's a pretty
little bird though.

19:58.818 --> 20:00.129
Real delicate, real gamey.

20:03.374 --> 20:06.343
GORDON RAMSEY: A verydifficult, demanding bird.

20:06.446 --> 20:09.863
Oh, fucking shit.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.314
I was looking at the
bird, like the shit was

20:12.418 --> 20:14.592
going to start talking to me.

20:14.696 --> 20:16.387
Like, hey, Bret, youshould cook me like this.

20:16.491 --> 20:18.769
Or hey, Bret, you should
cook me like that.

20:18.872 --> 20:21.392
You know, fortunately,
quail cooks quick enough

20:21.496 --> 20:22.876
where I can think about
it, because I don't

20:22.980 --> 20:24.153
want to just put it together.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.707
This is something that Ireally need to think about,

20:25.810 --> 20:26.673
because it has to be perfect.

20:29.642 --> 20:32.748
VALERIE GORDON: You
guys got 15 minutes now.

20:32.852 --> 20:34.163
KANAE HOUSTON: This
does not want to rice.

20:34.267 --> 20:38.409
This freaking cauliflower,it is not ricing.

20:38.513 --> 20:40.584
Granted, I've neverriced cauliflower before.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.865
Cauliflower, you can
kiss my ass if you

20:45.968 --> 20:48.557
think you're going to stop mefrom getting a black jacket.

20:48.661 --> 20:50.904
Hell yeah.

20:51.008 --> 20:52.596
Seven minutes.

20:52.699 --> 20:54.183
I was going to cook
it whole, pan seared.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.184
Yeah.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.565
I think my most
challenging ingredient

20:56.669 --> 21:00.155
is a quail itself, because I'venever worked with it before.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.501
I can cut the wings off, right?

21:01.605 --> 21:02.916
You can do
whatever you want to.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.987
The breast is very thin.

21:05.091 --> 21:08.439
So I've stuffed the cavity,and I'm going to cut the legs

21:08.543 --> 21:09.544
and the wings off.

21:09.647 --> 21:11.131
Hopefully, it doesn't
bite me in the ass.

21:11.235 --> 21:12.926
I'm just going to make
it the star of the show.

21:13.030 --> 21:15.550
No arms, no legs.

21:15.653 --> 21:17.137
GORDON RAMSEY: Three minutes.

21:17.241 --> 21:21.072
Get creative and make surethere's harmony on your plates.

21:21.176 --> 21:22.591
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Yes, Chef.

21:22.695 --> 21:24.179
GORDON RAMSEY: 60 seconds to go.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.836
CHRIS MOTTO: Come on,
think quick, Kanae.

21:25.939 --> 21:27.182
Push, push, push.

21:27.286 --> 21:32.014
GORDON RAMSEY: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

21:32.118 --> 21:34.983
Right, time is up, well done.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.123
OK, let's start off
with Kanae please.

21:37.226 --> 21:39.332
Let's go.

21:39.436 --> 21:41.610
I hear Chef's voice.

21:41.714 --> 21:42.611
Oh, my god!

21:42.715 --> 21:43.543
Oh, my god.

21:43.647 --> 21:45.234
ARIEL FOX: This is so cool.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.720
GORDON RAMSEY:
Describe your dish.

21:47.823 --> 21:52.897
I have a char grilled
quail with a creamy rice

21:53.001 --> 21:54.658
cauliflower and creamy leek.

21:54.761 --> 21:56.522
GORDON RAMSEY: Cauliflowerdoesn't look that appetizing.

21:56.625 --> 21:59.145
I'm just a bit confused,
because it looks gloopy.

21:59.248 --> 22:00.767
Why?

22:00.871 --> 22:04.702
KANAE HOUSTON: Um, I wanted todo like a creamy cauliflower,

22:04.806 --> 22:07.947
but with the, I wanted
to rice the cauliflower,

22:08.050 --> 22:10.743
that was my initial thought.

22:10.846 --> 22:12.503
The actual cauliflowertastes better than it looks.

22:12.607 --> 22:13.780
Thank you, Chef.

22:13.884 --> 22:15.610
A little bit more
spice in the eggplant.

22:15.713 --> 22:18.302
But the hero is the quail, andit's definitely standing out.

22:18.406 --> 22:19.786
Good job.
- Thank you, Chef.

22:19.890 --> 22:20.960
Thank you.

22:21.063 --> 22:23.100
I feel like I nailed
every single element.

22:23.203 --> 22:25.067
So at this point, I'm
like, there's no way

22:25.171 --> 22:26.448
I'm not getting a black jacket.

22:26.552 --> 22:27.967
Right, up next.

22:28.070 --> 22:28.864
Motto, let's go please.

22:31.902 --> 22:32.696
Here, Chef.

22:32.799 --> 22:33.697
Go, Motto.

22:33.800 --> 22:34.629
Right.

22:34.732 --> 22:36.389
Describe your bird.

22:36.493 --> 22:37.459
CHRIS MOTTO: All right.

22:37.563 --> 22:40.117
This is like country
quail come to town.

22:40.220 --> 22:43.189
The country quail has takenflight and landed in the city.

22:43.292 --> 22:45.156
Well, he took a dip
in a brine over there

22:45.260 --> 22:47.918
and then got a quicksnack, and stuffed himself

22:48.021 --> 22:49.229
with some thyme and
bay leaf, and then

22:49.333 --> 22:50.714
had to throw on his pinstripes.

22:50.817 --> 22:52.785
Now he's just waiting on
the rest of the party.

22:52.888 --> 22:57.652
Motto's quail looks like hehad half a bottle of tequila,

22:57.755 --> 23:00.275
and he's just kind of likeperched like on a wall

23:00.379 --> 23:02.933
just looking kind of drunk.

23:03.036 --> 23:03.934
Looks good.

23:04.037 --> 23:04.831
Yeah.

23:04.935 --> 23:05.936
It does look good.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.247
It looks really good.

23:07.351 --> 23:09.146
GORDON RAMSEY: Do you wantthe cauliflower this raw?

23:09.249 --> 23:11.769
CHRIS MOTTO: A little textureto kind of break that puree.

23:11.873 --> 23:13.081
I think a little bite
in the cauliflower

23:13.184 --> 23:14.772
would do the dish nice.

23:14.876 --> 23:16.947
The awkwardness of this
is the raw cauliflower.

23:17.050 --> 23:20.364
Yes, it's texture, butjust maybe smaller florets.

23:20.468 --> 23:22.193
Ah, but it's a
bloody good quail.

23:22.297 --> 23:23.160
Nailed it, good job.

23:23.263 --> 23:24.057
Thank you, Chef.

23:24.161 --> 23:25.404
Really good.

23:25.507 --> 23:27.026
He's got it.
Right.

23:27.129 --> 23:28.130
Next up, Heather,
let's go please.

23:33.515 --> 23:34.723
OK.

23:34.827 --> 23:36.829
Chef, I took the wings andthe legs off of the quail,

23:36.932 --> 23:39.245
because I stuffed the cavitywith a little bit of parsley,

23:39.348 --> 23:41.281
lemon, and some of the leeks.

23:41.385 --> 23:42.628
KANAE HOUSTON: When
I see Heather's dish,

23:42.731 --> 23:45.182
I'm looking like,
where is the quail.

23:45.285 --> 23:46.632
Where did the quail go?

23:46.735 --> 23:48.737
GORDON RAMSEY: So did you usethe legs, wings for any of it?

23:48.841 --> 23:49.600
I didn't, Chef.

23:49.704 --> 23:51.015
No.

23:51.119 --> 23:51.913
What's the stuffing here?

23:52.016 --> 23:53.293
What is that?

23:53.397 --> 23:56.435
HEATHER WILLIAMS: I just, lemon,parsley, some of the leak.

23:56.538 --> 23:58.022
GORDON RAMSEY: When you
got that lemon in there.

23:58.126 --> 23:59.161
Mm-hmm.

23:59.265 --> 24:00.473
Turns it bitter.

24:00.577 --> 24:02.613
Like. if you put a lemonit, then you take it out.

24:02.717 --> 24:04.028
Rookie mistake.

24:04.132 --> 24:05.444
Cauliflower, delicious.

24:05.547 --> 24:07.515
Eggplant, exceptional.

24:07.618 --> 24:08.792
So everything else
works beautifully.

24:08.895 --> 24:09.758
Except for the lemon.

24:09.862 --> 24:10.690
The lemon.

24:10.794 --> 24:11.622
Gotcha.

24:11.726 --> 24:13.313
Thank you.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.834
I got chunks of lemon still.

24:16.938 --> 24:20.113
I can't catch a
break today, at all.

24:20.217 --> 24:21.045
One more dish.

24:21.149 --> 24:23.082
Bret, describe your dish please.

24:23.185 --> 24:24.980
BRET HAUSER: So I have
a herbs de provence char

24:25.084 --> 24:29.329
grilled quail servedwith a cauliflower puree.

24:29.433 --> 24:31.884
A bit much on that puree,
but it looks kinda cool.

24:31.987 --> 24:33.057
Yeah, it looks good.

24:33.161 --> 24:34.680
Yeah.

24:34.783 --> 24:35.888
BRET HAUSER: Char
grilled eggplant

24:35.991 --> 24:37.959
topped with a lemon
zest and herb remoulade.

24:38.062 --> 24:39.305
I look at that
dish and I don't

24:39.408 --> 24:41.583
think you've done it, becauseyou're quite a robust man.

24:41.687 --> 24:42.826
But you've nailed that.

24:42.929 --> 24:46.830
Quail now pureed,
smart intuition.

24:46.933 --> 24:48.383
Eggplant's the only
bit that doesn't

24:48.487 --> 24:50.834
match the rest of
the high standard

24:50.937 --> 24:52.007
that you put on the plate.

24:52.111 --> 24:52.974
But it's a bloody good effort.

24:53.077 --> 24:53.871
Thank you.

24:53.975 --> 24:56.287
Thank you, Chef.

24:56.391 --> 25:01.741
Hopefully I got a winner winner,quail dinner, ha, ha, ha.

25:01.845 --> 25:03.950
I feel like Bret and
Motto are coming back.

25:04.054 --> 25:04.882
Yep.

25:04.986 --> 25:07.816
Based on this last performance.

25:07.920 --> 25:08.955
Oh, my god.

25:09.059 --> 25:13.926
Time to find out who
is going to make it

25:14.029 --> 25:16.445
into that elite
group and be joining

25:16.549 --> 25:21.416
Ariel and Mia in thatincredible Black Jacket Lounge.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.245
Oh, my god, who is it?

25:23.349 --> 25:24.384
Who is it?

25:24.488 --> 25:27.077
GORDON RAMSEY: The
next chef to receive

25:27.180 --> 25:30.114
the coveted black jacket is.

26:43.705 --> 26:45.811
That's what I'm
talking about, yo!

26:45.914 --> 26:49.055
He's not my favorite
in the competition,

26:49.159 --> 26:49.987
but I'm happy for him.

26:50.091 --> 26:50.919
Oh, yeah!

26:51.023 --> 26:53.335
This one's for you right there!

26:53.439 --> 26:54.785
The reason I'm a chef,
is because my mother

26:54.889 --> 26:55.993

26:56.097 --> 26:57.546
Because for them
right there, you know,

26:57.650 --> 26:59.618
they was really rooting forme on my original season

26:59.721 --> 27:01.033
when they were still alive.

27:01.136 --> 27:02.448
That's what I'm talking about!

27:02.551 --> 27:05.175
So this one was
definitely for them.

27:05.278 --> 27:06.763
Definitely for them.

27:06.866 --> 27:10.559
Damn, I look good in this coat!

27:49.219 --> 27:51.324
CHRIS MOTTO: I got a
black jacket, you know!

27:51.428 --> 27:54.431
Kind of solidifying thefact that I do belong here.

27:54.534 --> 27:57.365
Now I'm starting to
find myself even more

27:57.468 --> 27:59.332
through my cooking
and everything else.

27:59.436 --> 28:02.646
And I think people might
should watch out for me.

We play nine ball, eight ball?

28:15.210 --> 28:16.004
What are we doing here?

28:16.108 --> 28:17.074
We're like three drinks in.

28:17.178 --> 28:18.248
I don't know how long
I'm going to play.

28:18.351 --> 28:19.801
And I was already.

BRET HAUSER: Who is it?

28:20.802 --> 28:22.424
Answer.

28:22.528 --> 28:25.600
Bad news in the house!

28:25.704 --> 28:27.015
That's what I was
talking about, homey!

28:27.119 --> 28:29.121
I told you I'd see
you in the black room.

28:29.224 --> 28:31.468
Motto, I'm super
stoked to see here.

28:31.571 --> 28:34.574
He definitely deserves
to be in a black jacket.

28:34.678 --> 28:35.817
Get a drink, buddy.

28:35.921 --> 28:37.232
Do I think I'm still
going to beat him?

28:37.336 --> 28:38.233
Yes.

28:38.337 --> 28:39.372
Cheers to an black squad.

28:39.476 --> 28:42.548
We got one more to come.

28:42.651 --> 28:46.034
GORDON RAMSEY: Two talentedchefs, one jacket up for grabs.

28:46.138 --> 28:48.416
That means only one of
you will be moving on.

28:48.519 --> 28:51.177
Heather, I've seen betterfrom you, young lady.

28:51.281 --> 28:52.213
I know, Chef.

28:52.316 --> 28:53.421
And I know what
you're capable of,

28:53.524 --> 28:55.630
but I'm not quite feeling it.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.114
- Yes, Chef.
- You OK?

28:57.218 --> 28:58.495
Yes, Chef.

28:58.598 --> 29:00.290
I'm better than these tworounds for the black jackets.

29:00.393 --> 29:03.224
Like, I don't understandwhat is going on with me.

29:03.327 --> 29:04.397
You know, I'm getting
shit that I've

29:04.501 --> 29:08.229
never cooked before and I just.

29:08.332 --> 29:11.784
It's conquering me, and I'mnot going to be defeated.

29:11.888 --> 29:12.785
Kanae, how are you feeling?

29:12.889 --> 29:13.682
I'm pumped, Chef.

29:13.786 --> 29:14.960
I'm ready to cook.

29:15.063 --> 29:17.686
You've been so close
to the mark twice.

29:17.790 --> 29:18.653
Continue pushing.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.965
I will, Chef.

29:20.068 --> 29:21.621
My eye's on the prize.

29:21.725 --> 29:24.107
Going down to the last round,I'm going to kill it, period.

29:24.210 --> 29:26.040
I'm killing it.

29:26.143 --> 29:30.941
I've thought long and hard ofwhat this final test should be.

29:31.045 --> 29:33.875
Let me tell you, I love
all styles of cuisine,

29:33.979 --> 29:36.844
but nothing excites me
more than the dish that

29:36.947 --> 29:40.433
combines two amazing proteins.

29:40.537 --> 29:42.125
And of course,
I'm talking about.

29:42.228 --> 29:43.126
Surf and turf.

29:43.229 --> 29:45.922
Surf and turf,
you got it, ladies.

29:46.025 --> 29:48.683
Give it everything you've got,because your future depends

29:48.787 --> 29:50.650
on this final challenge.

29:50.754 --> 29:51.548
Understood?

29:51.651 --> 29:52.652
Yes, Chef.

29:52.756 --> 29:54.896
I'm here for me and
I'm here for my son.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.073
And nothing is stopping
me from getting

29:59.176 --> 30:00.729
into that Black Jacket Lounge.

30:00.833 --> 30:04.043
Your 45 minutes starts now.

30:04.147 --> 30:05.320
Let's go.

30:05.424 --> 30:08.082
Take a good look at
those ingredients.

30:08.185 --> 30:10.463
They are the best.

30:10.567 --> 30:12.534
KANAE HOUSTON: I came
into this competition

30:12.638 --> 30:15.883
knowing that I will be
a black jacket member.

30:15.986 --> 30:18.540
And my eye's on the
prize right now.

30:18.644 --> 30:20.749
Amazing, amazing, amazing.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.337
Off we go.

30:22.441 --> 30:24.029
HEATHER WILLIAMS: I gotgood facing off with Kanae.

30:24.132 --> 30:27.308
She's a really good competitor,so at the end of the day,

30:27.411 --> 30:29.068
I just need to have
that slight edge

30:29.172 --> 30:30.587
and I need to be
better than her.

30:30.690 --> 30:31.726
CHRISTINA WILSON: You got this?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.521
Yeah, still working
out everything as I go.

30:33.624 --> 30:34.902
What are you doing?
Pork chop?

30:35.005 --> 30:35.972
I'm going to do pork.

30:36.075 --> 30:36.938
Keep working, keep working,

30:37.042 --> 30:38.698
And spot prawn.

30:38.802 --> 30:39.976
I want to be creative.

30:40.079 --> 30:43.048
So I am doing Asian
surf and turf.

30:43.151 --> 30:44.187
Who does that?

30:44.290 --> 30:46.016
This is extremely creative.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.260
It's extremely fun making it.

30:48.363 --> 30:52.436
And I think it's
going to be delicious.

30:52.540 --> 30:53.506
CHRISTINA WILSON:
Yours is pretty

30:53.610 --> 30:54.404
straightforward over here.

30:54.507 --> 30:55.336
Yep.

30:55.439 --> 30:56.958
One of my favorites, Chef.

30:57.062 --> 30:59.305
Thinking outside the boxhasn't gotten me far, so.

30:59.409 --> 31:02.861
I'm going back to what Iknow and what I do every day

31:02.964 --> 31:05.242
at my job with surf and turf.

31:05.346 --> 31:07.520
Filet mignon and lobster tails.

31:07.624 --> 31:09.971
But I want to step
it up a notch.

31:10.075 --> 31:13.975
I want to give it that oomph.

31:14.079 --> 31:15.287
KANAE HOUSTON: How
you feeling, Heather?

31:15.390 --> 31:16.633
Good.

31:17.634 --> 31:18.773
Feel good.

31:18.877 --> 31:23.088
Heather is plain Janewhen it comes to cooking.

31:23.191 --> 31:26.091
I already know that she's doingthe typical surf and turf.

31:26.194 --> 31:28.024
I don't even have to
look, I just know it.

31:28.127 --> 31:29.749
16 minutes to go, ladies.

31:29.853 --> 31:32.511
KANAE HOUSTON: I am so surprisethat Chef Ramsay hasn't asked

31:32.614 --> 31:36.480
her, Heather, have you peaked?

31:36.584 --> 31:38.689
Yes, you've peaked, Heather.

31:38.793 --> 31:40.070

Blood, sweat, tears,

31:44.557 --> 31:47.043
passion, drive, determination.

31:47.146 --> 31:48.803
Everything is in this dish.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.253
I feel really confident.

31:50.356 --> 31:51.495
I'm doing me.

31:51.599 --> 31:54.982
And it feels
really, really good.

31:55.085 --> 31:56.155
Oh!

31:56.259 --> 31:57.743
Oh, my god.

31:57.846 --> 31:58.882

Tough day.

34:15.950 --> 34:17.055

with a fillet and a
lobster tail and claw,

34:22.784 --> 34:27.444
with sauteed broccoli rabe andYukon gold mashed potatoes.

34:27.548 --> 34:29.895
I kind of took a step
back and went back

34:29.998 --> 34:31.276
into the comfort zone, but.

34:35.038 --> 34:35.832
But what?

34:35.935 --> 34:37.144
It's my redemption.

34:37.247 --> 34:38.455
Wow.

34:38.559 --> 34:40.871
KANAE HOUSTON: Why would youstay in your comfort zone?

34:40.975 --> 34:42.701
What is that proving to him?

34:42.804 --> 34:46.014
Broccolini, I did a little bitof salt, pepper, chicken stock.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.396
You haven't proven shit.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.363
So you used half the lobster.

34:49.466 --> 34:50.295
Yes.

34:50.398 --> 34:51.606
How'd you cook this lobster?

34:51.710 --> 34:53.401
Brandy butter poached.

34:53.505 --> 34:55.610
I wanted to bring
that hint of brandy

34:55.714 --> 34:57.198
right through at the end, Chef.

34:57.302 --> 34:58.096
That lobster's delicious.

34:58.199 --> 34:59.027
It's so soft.

34:59.131 --> 34:59.925
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Yes.

35:00.028 --> 35:01.271
It's just kind of boring.

35:01.375 --> 35:02.169
Yeah.

35:02.272 --> 35:03.756
She plays it safe.

35:03.860 --> 35:04.964
That wine on
her jacket though.

35:05.068 --> 35:06.552
GORDON RAMSEY: Temperature,what's have you got?

35:06.656 --> 35:07.829
I'm going to mid
rare for that, Chef,

35:07.933 --> 35:08.899
GORDON RAMSEY: Mid rare?

35:09.003 --> 35:10.108
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Yes.

35:10.211 --> 35:12.731
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow, it'scutting through with ease.

35:12.834 --> 35:18.461
Yeah, that is a
perfect mid rare.

35:18.564 --> 35:19.358
Filet, nails.

35:19.462 --> 35:20.325
Thank you, Chef.

35:20.428 --> 35:21.567
GORDON RAMSEY:
Lobster, delicious.

35:21.671 --> 35:25.502
Plating, when you havecontours like a filet mignon

35:25.606 --> 35:28.333
and it's round and the
lobster tail's round,

35:28.436 --> 35:30.852
the minute you startputting it on square plates,

35:30.956 --> 35:33.165
it just looks confusing.

35:33.269 --> 35:34.201
OK.

35:34.304 --> 35:35.340
But it's a very,
very strong effort.

35:35.443 --> 35:36.237
Thank you.

35:36.341 --> 35:37.135
Thank you, Chef.

35:37.238 --> 35:38.791
I'm happy with my presentation.

35:38.895 --> 35:39.792
Should it be better?

35:39.896 --> 35:40.690
Yes.

35:40.793 --> 35:42.450
Is it going to win?

35:42.554 --> 35:44.659
Yes sir!

35:44.763 --> 35:47.145
Kanae, please step
forward, thank you.

35:47.248 --> 35:49.181
KANAE HOUSTON: My dish isextremely black jacket,

35:49.285 --> 35:53.772
it's creative, it is notyour typical surf and turf.

35:53.875 --> 35:54.669
GORDON RAMSEY: Wow.

35:54.773 --> 35:55.705
That looks beautiful.

35:55.808 --> 35:57.603
KANAE HOUSTON: It
is me on a plate.

35:57.707 --> 35:59.087
I think I'm solid.

35:59.191 --> 36:03.091
I have a single bone porkchop with a soy marinade

36:03.195 --> 36:05.749
coconut poached
shrimp, a slaw on top,

36:05.853 --> 36:08.338
and coconut in cilantro rice.

36:08.442 --> 36:12.653
Have you ever cooked
a dish like this before?

36:12.756 --> 36:13.654
Uh, no.

36:13.757 --> 36:14.793
GORDON RAMSEY: No.

36:14.896 --> 36:16.208
HEATHER WILLIAMS: Her
life is on the line,

36:16.312 --> 36:19.487
and she does something
completely new.

36:19.591 --> 36:20.937
Who does that shit?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.559
GORDON RAMSEY: I thinkwhat excites me about you,

36:22.663 --> 36:24.906
is that you're not scared.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.494
You cook with no boundaries.

36:26.598 --> 36:27.771
Yes.

36:27.875 --> 36:29.601
GORDON RAMSEY: OK, andtemperature-wise, what have you

36:29.704 --> 36:30.843
gone for?

36:30.947 --> 36:34.295
I wanted to do like amedium well on that, Chef.

36:34.399 --> 36:35.745
GORDON RAMSEY: Yeah,
it's beautiful.

36:35.848 --> 36:37.885
[interposing voices]

36:37.988 --> 36:39.473
It's a chop, not a tenderloin.

36:39.576 --> 36:40.750
Yeah.

36:40.853 --> 36:42.096
You marinated it in soy.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.891
Why?

36:43.994 --> 36:46.583
Uh, because I feel
like it needed it.

36:50.656 --> 36:51.864
Did you clean these?

36:55.143 --> 36:56.524
Come on, Kanae.

36:56.628 --> 36:57.905
Hopefully they were clean.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.147
They look clean.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.563
They don't look clean.

37:00.666 --> 37:02.944
[music playing]

37:06.948 --> 37:08.778
NARRATOR: It's down to
the final challenge,

37:08.881 --> 37:10.952
and both Heather and
Kanae are fighting

37:11.056 --> 37:13.576
for the last black
jacket, and the right

37:13.679 --> 37:15.267
to stay in Hell's Kitchen.

37:15.371 --> 37:16.786
GORDON RAMSEY: Did
you clean these?

37:16.889 --> 37:17.959
Uh.

37:18.063 --> 37:19.306
GORDON RAMSEY: Sometimes
there's a sac in there.

37:19.409 --> 37:20.445
OK.

37:20.548 --> 37:22.447
HEATHER WILLIAMS: I'm
praying to the food gods

37:22.550 --> 37:24.828
that these prawns are notclean, because at this point,

37:24.932 --> 37:29.695
I need any small technical errorto give me that slight edge.

37:29.799 --> 37:32.146
And if you're smart,
you can twist the tail

37:32.250 --> 37:33.285
and it comes out.

37:37.841 --> 37:40.327
When I broke it off, I alwaystwist that tail at the end.

37:40.430 --> 37:41.673
- You did?
- Yes.

37:41.776 --> 37:42.363
So you did.
OK, so they are clean.

37:42.467 --> 37:43.571
Good.

37:43.675 --> 37:46.022
Nice save.

37:46.125 --> 37:47.437
Prawns are cooked beautifully.

37:47.541 --> 37:48.404
It's very sweet.

37:48.507 --> 37:50.302
A little bit more lemon.

37:50.406 --> 37:52.615
And the rice, give
it a counterbalance.

37:52.718 --> 37:54.513
Rice is under seasoned.

37:54.617 --> 37:55.859
You got a bed of it
underneath there,

37:55.963 --> 37:57.171
so it needs a touch of help.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.068
KANAE HOUSTON: Right.

37:58.172 --> 37:59.725
GORDON RAMSEY: Pork, delicious.

37:59.829 --> 38:01.417
Great, thank you.KANAE HOUSTON: Thank you, Chef.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.383
Wow.

38:02.487 --> 38:03.971
Strong effort, Kanae.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.144
KANAE HOUSTON: Thank you, Chef.

38:05.248 --> 38:07.215
I don't see why I don't
deserve a black jacket.

38:07.319 --> 38:11.047
I did not play it safe at all,and I will never play it safe.

38:11.150 --> 38:15.154
Ladies, you did not
make this easy for me.

38:15.258 --> 38:19.124
Both are unique, creativetakes on surf and turf.

38:19.227 --> 38:20.021
Tough.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.299
Who you think?
Kanae?

38:21.402 --> 38:22.196
Kanae.

38:22.300 --> 38:23.991
I think Kanae deserves it.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.476
But I still have to act
excited if it's not.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.960
I know.

38:28.064 --> 38:29.617
It might be.

38:29.721 --> 38:31.688
The last black jacket goes to.

38:31.792 --> 38:32.896
Who's it going to be?

38:33.000 --> 38:33.794
Oh!

38:33.897 --> 38:34.691
Done.

38:34.795 --> 38:36.728
Oh, my god!

38:36.831 --> 38:38.902
Congratulations.

38:39.006 --> 38:39.972
A near flawless dish.

38:44.356 --> 38:47.842
Heather, well done.

38:47.946 --> 38:49.361
I'm proud of you.

38:49.465 --> 38:50.500
I am so proud of you.

38:50.604 --> 38:51.398
Thank you.

38:51.501 --> 38:52.882
So proud of you.

38:52.985 --> 38:55.367
Your best dish of thenight, young lady, you left it

38:55.471 --> 38:58.059
to last moment, just in time.

38:58.163 --> 38:59.060
Yeah!

38:59.164 --> 39:01.546
I'm back at the
Black Jacket Lounge.

39:01.649 --> 39:03.686
I was fighting for
my life and I finally

39:03.789 --> 39:05.722
got in on the last go round.

39:05.826 --> 39:07.241
Thank you, Chef.
- Congratulations.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.173
- Keep your head up, all right?- Great job.

39:08.276 --> 39:08.725
Tell everybody
I say hi and bye.

39:08.829 --> 39:09.830
I will.

39:09.933 --> 39:10.727
Thank you, Chef.

39:10.831 --> 39:12.660
Well done.

39:12.764 --> 39:14.800
Kanae, please come
forward, young lady.

39:14.904 --> 39:16.423
Oh dear.

39:16.526 --> 39:18.217
Let me tell you somethingreally important.

39:18.321 --> 39:20.772
You may not be
ready yet to become

39:20.875 --> 39:22.532
my executive chef
at Caesar's Palace,

39:22.636 --> 39:26.881
but you are going
on to great things.

39:26.985 --> 39:29.505
And you'll become an
amazing executive chef.

39:29.608 --> 39:31.438
Yes, I will, thank you, Chef.

39:31.541 --> 39:33.232
You have got nothing
to feel sorry about.

39:33.336 --> 39:34.648
Yeah.

39:34.751 --> 39:35.407
GORDON RAMSEY: And you have gotnothing to put your head down.

39:35.511 --> 39:36.684
Yeah, I'm proud of myself.

39:36.788 --> 39:38.134
GORDON RAMSEY: And
so you should be.

39:38.237 --> 39:39.204
Please, give me your jacket.

39:39.307 --> 39:40.757
OK.

39:40.861 --> 39:43.933
Oh, Kanae, I thoughtI'd never be saying that.

39:44.036 --> 39:45.037
Tell me you've enjoyed it.

39:45.141 --> 39:47.799
Oh, I've loved every
moment of this, Chef.

39:47.902 --> 39:49.663
Dream come true.

39:49.766 --> 39:51.250
Thank you.KANAE HOUSTON: Thank you.

39:51.354 --> 39:52.182
GORDON RAMSEY: Best of luck.

39:52.286 --> 39:53.114
KANAE HOUSTON: Thank you.

39:53.218 --> 39:54.184
Bye, Hell's Kitchen!

39:57.153 --> 39:58.948
Nothing compares
to this experience.

39:59.051 --> 40:02.192
Nothing I think ever willcompare to this experience.

40:02.296 --> 40:06.093
It makes me so happy to knowI stayed here this long.

40:06.196 --> 40:09.337
Like, I know I wanted to winit, but still, it's like, damn

40:09.441 --> 40:10.546
I did good.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.788
I am so proud of myself.

40:14.791 --> 40:15.758
It's Kanae.

40:15.861 --> 40:17.829
I bet the farm on her right now.

40:17.932 --> 40:18.795
ARIEL FOX: I know.

40:18.899 --> 40:20.418
Your lineup for
your starting five,

40:20.521 --> 40:26.009
last but not least, fromSouth Central Los Angeles.

40:26.113 --> 40:28.287
Where's that a little homey?

40:28.391 --> 40:29.185
Where's she at?

40:29.288 --> 40:31.567
Where's that little homey?

40:31.670 --> 40:33.465
You thought it
was the end of me!

40:33.569 --> 40:34.432
Yes.

40:35.571 --> 40:36.503
Wow.

40:36.606 --> 40:38.781
Oh, wow, don't look
so fuckin' happy.

40:38.884 --> 40:39.713
Wow.

40:39.816 --> 40:43.061
Oh, shit, it's Heather.

40:43.164 --> 40:44.372
Oh, my god.

40:44.476 --> 40:47.306
Don't look so happy,
guys, holy shit, thanks.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.101
Oh, my god.

40:49.205 --> 40:52.933
I'm so excited Ariel
looks like her dog died.

40:53.036 --> 40:56.971
Bret looks like, what.

40:57.075 --> 40:59.146
Yeah, bro, I'm back.

40:59.249 --> 41:01.355
I'm back with a
fucking vengeance.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.012
Like, don't make me
feel wanted or anything.

41:03.115 --> 41:05.117
[knocking]

41:05.221 --> 41:06.498
BRET HAUSER: Hello.

41:06.602 --> 41:08.431
Hey!

41:10.882 --> 41:11.814
GORDON RAMSEY: Congratulations.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.091
Thank you, Chef.

41:13.194 --> 41:15.300
That's my boy from the Bayou.

41:15.403 --> 41:17.371
Southern boy chefhanging with the big dogs.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.752
It feels good.
- Yeah?

41:18.855 --> 41:20.063
I'm stoked about it.

41:20.167 --> 41:21.686
I'm only going to pick
up speed from here.

41:21.789 --> 41:23.273
Well, the next
time we see you,

41:23.377 --> 41:25.517
it's our first service
in the black jacket.

41:25.621 --> 41:26.898
So that needs to
be the best ever.

41:27.001 --> 41:28.071
MIA CASTRO: I love it here.

41:28.175 --> 41:29.797
I love the challenge.

41:29.901 --> 41:32.869
It feels so special to
be a part of this group,

41:32.973 --> 41:36.424
and I'm so grateful for
how much I've learned.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.944
GORDON RAMSEY: Heather,
what an emotional day.

41:39.048 --> 41:40.118
Yeah.

41:40.221 --> 41:41.464
You were losing it in there.What happened?

41:41.568 --> 41:42.430
I was.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.847
I got mad, and
that was a problem.

41:44.950 --> 41:46.642
And now it's
perfection here on out.

41:46.745 --> 41:49.092
There is no room
for excuses, no room

41:49.196 --> 41:50.542
for anything at this point.

41:50.646 --> 41:52.337
You've made it, andthat's the most important.

41:52.440 --> 41:57.307
I will cut your throat
out and stomp on it

41:57.411 --> 41:59.413
to get to where I need to be.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.725
Here's to the famous five.Well done.

42:00.828 --> 42:01.622
Thank you, Chef.

42:02.623 --> 42:03.590
Congratulations.

42:07.248 --> 42:08.353
The odds are narrowing down.

42:08.456 --> 42:09.492
All of you, well done.

42:09.596 --> 42:11.356
NARRATOR: Two rookies
and three veterans

42:11.459 --> 42:15.498
are locked in, as Chef Ramsay'selite Black Jacket Team.

42:15.602 --> 42:17.258
And then there were five.

42:17.362 --> 42:18.708
NARRATOR: And for
the first time,

42:18.812 --> 42:20.814
they'll cook out of one kitchen.

42:20.917 --> 42:21.987
GORDON RAMSEY: How long, Bret?

42:22.091 --> 42:23.851
Hey, don't put your fuckinghead down like that.

42:23.955 --> 42:26.647
I told you stop
talking, fucking do it.

42:26.751 --> 42:29.581
NARRATOR: But withexpectations higher than ever.

42:29.685 --> 42:31.618
