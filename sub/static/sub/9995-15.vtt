Previously on Medium:

00:01.710 --> 00:02.530
Miss Doyle.

00:02.560 --> 00:06.030
I want to help you develop your
solar cell amplification system.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.590
In exchange for funding,
she wants 51% ownership.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.750
Do you want to give up
control of your idea?

00:11.780 --> 00:13.890
- No,of course I don't.
- Then don't.

00:13.900 --> 00:18.450
I'm sorry,but unless you're
willing to rethink the 51/49 split,

00:18.460 --> 00:20.230
I don't see how I can do this with you.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.230
So,how did it go? How'd she take it?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.200
I signed the papers.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.300
Meghan Doyle.

00:26.310 --> 00:27.940
So nice to finally meet you.

00:27.950 --> 00:29.830
Yeah,it's nice to finally meet you.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.040
Well,she's very pretty.

00:32.049 --> 00:34.440
Well,let's try not to
hold that against her.

00:34.450 --> 00:37.170
I just now realized that
I don't have my wallet.

00:37.180 --> 00:38.900
Okay. Miss you.

00:38.910 --> 00:41.690
I thought you were with the boyfriend.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.960
Best-laid plans...

00:43.980 --> 00:47.210
Or not laid, as the case may be.

01:01.200 --> 01:05.500
That is one sharp lunchbox.

01:05.510 --> 01:07.210
No,seriously.

01:07.230 --> 01:10.550
My brother has one
just like it. He's six.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.140
So,what's your excuse?

01:13.930 --> 01:16.310
Oh,come on,loser.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.170
You know you want to say
something, so just say it.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.840
Yeah. Didn't think so.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.630
Damn,kid. You scared me.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.560
Thought you were Sister Beatrice.

02:05.720 --> 02:08.830
You know if you tell her I'm
out here,you are dead meat.

02:11.530 --> 02:14.470
Kid! I'm talking to you!

02:25.560 --> 02:27.140
No,no...

03:14.160 --> 03:16.320
I don't get it.

03:16.820 --> 03:19.360
I thought these things were
supposed to make me see better,

03:19.370 --> 03:22.850
but all they're doing
is making things fuzzy.

03:22.860 --> 03:24.350
They make Marie see better.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.570
They're prescription. They
only work for her,doofus.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.880
- Give 'em back!
- No.

03:28.890 --> 03:31.050
- Give 'em back!
- No.

03:31.060 --> 03:33.920
Hey,Bridgette,give your
sister her glasses back.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.730
Girls,keep it quiet,okay, 'cause Daddy
had to work late, and he's still asleep.

03:42.420 --> 03:43.140
Hello?

03:43.160 --> 03:45.400
Hey,it's me. I was wondering
how your morning looks.

03:45.410 --> 03:48.800
Uh,I'm just...I'm making my girls
lunch, dropping them off at school,

03:48.810 --> 03:50.450
and then I'm wide open. Why?

03:50.460 --> 03:53.250
Care to lend your considerable
talents to the Phoenix PD?

03:53.270 --> 03:57.360
Oh,really? I didn't think the Phoenix
PD was all that interested in my...

03:57.370 --> 03:59.960
considerable talents these days.

03:59.980 --> 04:03.160
That'd be District Attorney
Van Dyke's policy,not mine.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.900
So what do you say? You
want to meet me for coffee?

04:06.630 --> 04:08.930
Guy's name is Curtis Lambert.

04:08.940 --> 04:12.000
Last night,somebody
snuck into his place.

04:12.020 --> 04:13.560
Shot him three times.

04:13.570 --> 04:16.230
Shot in each kneecap,
and one to the head.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.930
Sounds like whoever wanted to kill this
guy wanted him to suffer before he died.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.480
Lambert made his fortune
bringing heroin into Phoenix.

04:22.490 --> 04:25.830
Our narc squad has been trying to
build a case against him for years.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.190
I'm guessing maybe he got
killed by one of his competitors.

04:29.200 --> 04:33.260
Has all the hallmarks of
a really expensive hit.

04:33.270 --> 04:35.300
Getting past a top-of-the-line
security system,

04:35.310 --> 04:38.190
leaving a crime scene
that's clean as a whistle.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.020
Not a single fingerprint,
not a drop of DNA.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.370
All right,so,if you know
all this,why'd you call me?

04:43.380 --> 04:44.410
You're not listening to me.

04:44.430 --> 04:46.480
I'm trying to tell you
I don't know anything.

04:46.490 --> 04:49.240
In fact,all I know is what I don't know.

04:49.250 --> 04:52.760
Do me a favor: give the files a
look, see if something clicks for you.

04:52.780 --> 04:56.320
Anything will help. Anything that
will give me a bit of traction.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.100
- You want another one?
- Oh,no,thanks.

05:28.230 --> 05:30.490
No. No,please.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.410
I'm sorry.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.410
Okay. All right.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.920
Apology accepted.

05:56.930 --> 06:00.120
Now,would you get out
from behind my desk,please?

06:00.960 --> 06:04.240
I was drunk,Joe. I was excited.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.860
I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel uncomfortable.

06:07.890 --> 06:10.430
You're actually making me a little
uncomfortable right now. I'd really...

06:10.440 --> 06:15.180
I'd much prefer it if you would just sit
in your office so I could sit in mine.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.630
Thank you for putting me
in that cab last night.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.440
You're welcome.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.650
I didn't do it for you.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.530
I'm sorry I tried to kiss you.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.300
I-I'm sorry I tried to touch you.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.900
You're not sorry you hit me?

06:39.740 --> 06:41.480
I didn't hit you.

06:41.490 --> 06:45.300
I pushed you. I pushed
you to keep you off me.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.750
Obviously,I misjudged you.

06:48.760 --> 06:51.150
You're a man who loves his marriage.

06:51.170 --> 06:53.570
A man who loves his wife.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.990
You tell her?

06:57.000 --> 07:00.620
No. What am I going to say?

07:00.630 --> 07:03.260
You got drunk and tried to grope me?

07:03.280 --> 07:08.420
Look,Meghan, my family's future
is tied up in this business.

07:08.430 --> 07:12.910
I mean,there's no way that I'm going
to let your stupidity compromise that.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.190
Or my marriage.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.090
Okay. Well,I can see I've totally
blown your trust. I get that.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.810
And I'm going to make
this up to you. You'll see.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.580
I'm going to work twice as hard.

07:24.610 --> 07:28.200
I'm going to line up
banks, big ticket investors.

07:28.210 --> 07:33.430
Get us some major R&D money from some
energy contractors I've been cultivating.

07:33.820 --> 07:38.080
You won't regret going into
business with me,Joe. You won't.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.870
- If you say so.
- I do.

07:41.630 --> 07:46.130
Okay. Just do me a favor.
Keep your hands to yourself.

07:46.870 --> 07:49.150
And drink on your own time.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.980
Because if I see you so much
as look at me cross-eyed again,

07:53.010 --> 07:56.190
- I'm gonna take my idea, all my ideas...
- Our ideas.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.690
And I'm out of here. I'll go to a judge.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.750
I'll do whatever has to be done.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.280
Well,let's not get dramatic,Joe.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.580
I mean,it's not going to come to that.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.680
There's too much money to be
made, too much success to be had.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.360
I really am sorry.

08:17.370 --> 08:20.250
You have my word: it won't happen again.

08:25.620 --> 08:29.230
You know,you stare at those too long,
you're gonna burn a hole through them.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.530
I'm serious. I'm a scientist.
I know these things.

08:33.230 --> 08:36.429
Sorry. I was trying to help
Lee a little; that's all.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.970
So,how are things going at
Dubois-Doyle Enterprises,LLC?

08:50.350 --> 08:52.000
It's kind of weird.

08:52.010 --> 08:55.250
You're finally back to work, and you seem
to have almost nothing to say about it.

08:55.270 --> 08:57.630
Well,there's not a lot to say.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.860
What about Meghan? How's
it to work with her?

09:03.870 --> 09:05.650
Oh,I don't know,Al. I
just go to my office,

09:05.660 --> 09:09.550
and I try to figure out how to turn
my idea from something that's on paper

09:09.560 --> 09:11.970
into something that we
can show business people.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.480
You know,a model, a presentation.

09:14.510 --> 09:19.120
She's in her office talking
to lawyers and bankers and...

09:19.140 --> 09:21.820
You know, it's all very exciting.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.310
Hey,when are we gonna have
that dinner we talked about?

09:28.320 --> 09:29.920
What are you talking about?

09:29.930 --> 09:34.170
That dinner that we all talked
about last week. You,me,Meghan.

09:34.180 --> 09:35.570
- Oh,God.
- Whoever she wants to bring.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.420
Honestly? I don't know,Al.

09:39.130 --> 09:42.760
My sense is that Meghan has
a pretty active social life.

09:42.770 --> 09:45.750
It may be a while before
she can squeeze us in.

09:47.110 --> 09:50.230
Really? 'Cause I got the feeling that
she was really looking forward to it.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.910
Yeah?

09:51.940 --> 09:55.440
Well,she can be pretty
hard to read sometimes.

10:18.390 --> 10:21.550
You're not actually going to
light that in here,are you?

10:25.340 --> 10:28.230
So you gonna holster that or what?

10:33.910 --> 10:35.190
Wait. Don't tell me.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.510
This is the part where I'm supposed to
say you're good with your hands,right?

10:40.630 --> 10:43.310
Baby,you have no idea.

10:53.550 --> 10:56.760
Well,that's not something
you see much of anymore.

10:56.770 --> 10:57.880
What's that?

10:57.890 --> 10:59.810
A doctor who smokes.

10:59.820 --> 11:02.220
Sagemont Hospital,
Physical Rehabilitation.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.200
You're a doctor,right?

11:04.210 --> 11:06.550
'Cause that would
certainly explain the ego.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.600
You don't have to be a
doctor to have an ego,dear.

11:10.090 --> 11:12.540
You just have to be good.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.260
It's been a long time,Curtis.

12:06.050 --> 12:10.280
Yeah... I'd be surprised to see me,too.

12:21.030 --> 12:23.280
All right,one more
time for the slow kid.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.670
I don't know if he's a therapist
or a hospital administrator,

12:25.710 --> 12:28.080
but he definitely works here.

12:28.090 --> 12:30.580
Late 40s. I'm guessing like your height.

12:30.590 --> 12:34.740
Not great-looking,but he
has a way with the ladies.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.040
Oh,and he's really good with his hands.

12:36.080 --> 12:40.060
I saw him,uh, do this magic trick.

12:40.070 --> 12:44.820
And that bartender that he was hitting on,
she was at least 20 years younger than he was.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.290
So...

12:46.320 --> 12:48.270
he certainly doesn't
lack for confidence.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.240
That's for sure.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.450
And there he is.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.610
Sir?

13:00.620 --> 13:04.390
Detective Lee Scanlon. This is
my associate, Allison Dubois.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.630
We were wondering if we
could ask you a few questions.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.160
I'll take that as a "yes."

13:11.170 --> 13:13.290
Let's start with your name.

13:13.300 --> 13:16.080
Joey. Joey Carmichael.

13:16.090 --> 13:20.610
Tell me,Joey, you know someone
by the name of Curtis Lambert?

13:20.630 --> 13:24.410
No. Why do you want to know?

13:24.420 --> 13:27.440
Somebody broke into his house two
nights ago, shot him three times.

13:27.450 --> 13:29.380
Now he's dead.

13:29.390 --> 13:30.730
That's terrible.

13:30.740 --> 13:33.260
Yeah,well, the thing of it is,Joey,

13:33.270 --> 13:36.450
I was wondering if you could account
for your whereabouts two nights ago.

13:36.460 --> 13:39.670
Wait a minute. I don't understand.
Am I in trouble for something?

13:39.680 --> 13:41.910
That's what we're here to find out.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.020
- Are these two friends of yours,Joey?
- No,they work for the police.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.060
They think that I hurt
somebody called Curtis Lambert.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.640
No. I'm...

13:48.650 --> 13:51.310
I'm sorry, do you mean Curtis
Lambert, the drug dealer?

13:51.330 --> 13:54.190
The guy they've been talking about
on TV for the last couple days?

13:54.210 --> 13:56.450
Yeah,I'm the lead
investigator on the case.

13:56.460 --> 13:59.940
We're here to follow up on a tip that
Mr. Carmichael might have been involved.

13:59.950 --> 14:01.820
- I never hurt anybody.
- I know,I know.

14:01.830 --> 14:05.010
Why don't you go ahead and
get started on your exercises?

14:05.020 --> 14:08.440
I need a few minutes to
talk to these people. Okay?

14:11.050 --> 14:12.610
Look,if this is some sort of joke...

14:12.630 --> 14:15.580
This isn't a joke,ma'am.
Your friend Joey over there...

14:15.590 --> 14:17.970
is a person of interest.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.300
Didn't they say that this Curtis
Lambert was shot? With a gun?

14:21.310 --> 14:24.880
That they broke into his house and
did something with his burglar alarm?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.240
Yeah,that's right.

14:26.260 --> 14:31.480
Well,I'm that man's therapist and I can tell you
Joey Carmichael hasn't had full use of his hands--

14:31.510 --> 14:35.330
much less a lot of his brain--
for more than four years now.

14:35.340 --> 14:37.590
That's why he comes here.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.900
See,that man there...
that's a walking miracle.

14:40.910 --> 14:43.630
Shot in the head and left for dead.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.230
Bullet's still in his brain.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.810
I mean,you can go and
talk to him if you want,

14:47.820 --> 14:50.970
but you'll see he has
the mind of a 12-year-old.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.750
Okay,decision time.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.960
Garbage or Bridgette's lunch tomorrow?

14:56.970 --> 15:00.760
Come on,focus. Garbage pail or
Bridgette's belly? The clock is ticking.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.830
Garbage.

15:03.830 --> 15:04.840
Fine.

15:04.850 --> 15:08.370
But Bridgette told me to tell you you've
got no shot for mother of the year.

15:09.730 --> 15:11.880
Someone's in a mood.

15:11.890 --> 15:14.150
It was a tough, embarrassing day.

15:14.170 --> 15:17.620
Embarrassing? Really?
You talking about Scanlon?

15:17.630 --> 15:19.600
Come on,Al,he's been
to this dance before.

15:19.610 --> 15:22.000
He knows that what you
do isn't an exact science.

15:22.020 --> 15:26.450
Joe,I spent half the day trying to lead
him to a high-end professional killer.

15:26.470 --> 15:29.410
When we get there,the guy's
got a bullet in his brain

15:29.430 --> 15:31.860
and looks like he can
barely turn a doorknob.

15:31.870 --> 15:35.600
Okay. I give you permission
to be embarrassed.

15:35.610 --> 15:39.490
If you do it in the bedroom,in
bed. With your eyes closed.

15:40.970 --> 15:44.450
For the last time: Stop
with the stupid crying.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.730
I mean it.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.760
Embarrassing yourself is one thing.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.080
Embarrassing me is another.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.840
You didn't have to do what you did.

15:53.850 --> 15:56.000
You didn't have to beat that kid up.

15:56.010 --> 15:57.540
Are you kidding me?

15:57.550 --> 15:59.120
After what he did to you?

15:59.140 --> 16:02.190
He's lucky I didn't break
more than just his jaw.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.710
Please.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.340
Let me tell the principal I did it.

16:06.670 --> 16:08.110
I mean...

16:08.120 --> 16:10.120
who's to say it wasn't me?

16:10.130 --> 16:13.550
Me. I say it wasn't you.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.810
Look... I'm sorry.

16:17.820 --> 16:22.600
I know I'm only three minutes older,
but that still makes me the big brother.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.980
That means I look out for you.

16:24.990 --> 16:27.770
Not the other way around.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.030
You.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.690
You're not supposed to be
here, only your brother.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.620
Joey Carmichael, if you don't go
back to class this very instant...

16:55.000 --> 16:57.290
Joey Carmichael.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.750
I think he has a twin.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.430
- Who's got a twin?
- Joey Carmichael.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.310
He's got a brother who
looks just like him.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.520
Okay,here we go.

17:06.530 --> 17:09.950
Theodore Carmichael,
born 9-19-61.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.960
- B and E specialist, by the looks of it.
- "B and E"?

17:14.650 --> 17:15.990
Breaking and entering.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.810
According to this,he started with a few
smash-and-grabs in his formative years,

17:20.819 --> 17:24.050
then graduated to more sophisticated
break-ins in the '80s and '90s.

17:24.079 --> 17:28.930
Main suspect in a jewelry store
burglary in '04, but never convicted.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.550
Guy like this could've gotten by Curtis
Lambert's alarm system in his sleep.

17:32.560 --> 17:37.130
You think maybe I'm right, that this is
the man I saw murder Lambert in my dreams?

17:37.140 --> 17:39.590
I'll put it to you this way:

17:39.930 --> 17:43.190
I'd sure as hell like to know
where he was three nights ago.

17:47.090 --> 17:49.100
You are so bad.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.030
Oh,sorry,I didn't realize you
were in the middle of something.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.690
No,no,no. This is good.

17:59.700 --> 18:01.990
I'll bet your ears were burning.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.860
Terry,this Joe Dubois, the
genius I was telling you about.

18:06.870 --> 18:07.640
- Joe
- Hello.

18:07.650 --> 18:09.170
this is Terry Cavanaugh.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.480
Terry's the owner of
Stratosphere Aeronautics.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.170
Pleased to meet you,Joe.

18:14.180 --> 18:17.330
Meghan was just telling me
all about your new venture.

18:17.340 --> 18:19.970
It all sounds promising. Very promising.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.010
Well,we're certainly excited.

18:22.020 --> 18:25.710
Well,if you'll excuse me.
I've got a plane to catch.

18:25.720 --> 18:28.700
I'm sure I'll be
talking to you both soon.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.630
Great presentation, little lady.

18:32.980 --> 18:36.170
You have my undivided attention.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.420
Mr. Dubois.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.330
What was that? Who was that?

18:44.340 --> 18:48.690
That? That's the John D.
Rockefeller of solar energy.

18:48.700 --> 18:53.420
That's the man with the deepest pockets in
the world when it comes to alternative fuels.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.430
And he's smitten with you,Joe.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.470
Your ideas.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.000
I told you I was going
to work twice as hard.

19:00.010 --> 19:02.760
I told you I was going
to make it up to you.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.620
I don't understand.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.990
If he's as important as you say
he is, then what's he doing here?

19:08.020 --> 19:09.900
Why is he coming to us?

19:09.910 --> 19:11.880
Terry and I go way back.

19:11.890 --> 19:15.800
We did a lot of business together
when I was at Buchanon-Lockhart.

19:15.810 --> 19:17.830
I just found out that he
was in town this morning

19:17.850 --> 19:21.230
and that he had a 30-minute
window before he had to fly home.

19:25.530 --> 19:29.250
Say... "Nice work,Meghan."

19:34.110 --> 19:36.950
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

19:36.980 --> 19:42.320
Haven't you ever done
something reckless...

19:42.330 --> 19:44.000
or stupid...

19:44.010 --> 19:48.370
and then had to go back to people who
were important to you and say "I'm sorry"?

19:48.760 --> 19:51.500
"Give me another chance"?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.220
That was Terry Cavanaugh.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.910
I don't know how to do better than that.

20:06.850 --> 20:08.900
Nice work,Meghan.

20:19.090 --> 20:21.090
Shh,shh,keep it down. Keep it down.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.890
- It took me half an hour to get the girls to sleep.
- Sorry.

20:25.420 --> 20:29.200
I've never seen a man so happy
about working late every night.

20:29.210 --> 20:32.360
What's going on over
there at Dubois-Doyle?

20:32.370 --> 20:36.060
Any extra employee benefits
you want to tell me about?

20:36.850 --> 20:40.510
Actually,I think that today
we sort of turned a corner.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.440
Earlier in the week, I wasn't so sure.

20:43.450 --> 20:46.080
- What do you mean?
- Oh,I don't know.

20:47.530 --> 20:51.750
I think for a while there I was just worried
that we weren't going to be the great team

20:51.760 --> 20:54.070
that I imagined we would be.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.430
And then today...

20:56.440 --> 20:59.660
I don't know, we were both,like,
firing on all cylinders.

20:59.670 --> 21:03.930
She brought in this,like, alternative
energy big shot and he really liked my stuff.

21:03.940 --> 21:08.870
And I made some really, really good
headway on the design for the prototype.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.730
I don't know,I think I just caught
a glimpse of our future again...

21:12.740 --> 21:15.530
and I liked what I saw.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.370
I know how difficult...

21:39.410 --> 21:41.930
I got to leave town,Joey.

21:41.940 --> 21:43.810
I don't know when I'll be
back. It could be a while.

21:43.820 --> 21:46.910
Actually,it could be long while,but...

21:48.160 --> 21:52.640
I didn't want to take off
without saying good-bye. So, bye.

21:53.500 --> 21:57.320
- What the hell have you gotten yourself into now,Teddy?
- Nothing.

21:57.330 --> 22:00.850
Just not seeing eye-to-eye
with some business partners.

22:01.150 --> 22:03.110
And it's a little misunderstanding.
I mean,everything's gonna be fine.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.430
I promise. Seriously.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.640
Hey,Teddy.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.750
I've been looking for you all night.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.170
What the hell's going
on,Teddy? Who is this guy?

22:16.610 --> 22:19.360
- Marty,I can explain.
- Not to me.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.730
Curtis wants to talk to you right now.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.110
I'm not going to give
you any trouble. Just...

22:24.120 --> 22:27.740
just do me a favor, okay? Leave my
brother out of this. He didn't do anything.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.540
I wish I could do
that,Teddy. I really do.

22:30.890 --> 22:33.060
No. What,wait! No!

22:48.280 --> 22:50.470
How do you like that,Teddy?

22:51.260 --> 22:54.160
You don't have any
witty comebacks now,huh?

22:54.540 --> 22:59.140
Why did you shoot my brother? You
didn't... you didn't have to do that.

22:59.560 --> 23:02.320
What you blaming us for,man?

23:02.330 --> 23:04.910
You should be looking at yourself.

23:04.920 --> 23:10.310
The minute you tried to leave town with my
money, you put everybody you love in danger.

23:10.320 --> 23:13.180
Joey didn't know anything about this.

23:13.190 --> 23:15.450
It doesn't matter.

23:16.030 --> 23:21.280
You know what? I'm
bored with this. End it.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.570
Oh,sorry.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.860
So,now you're telling me you
think Teddy Carmichael's dead.

23:40.870 --> 23:43.540
Teddy was executed by the same
man who shot Joey in the head,

23:43.560 --> 23:45.260
a man who worked for Curtis Lambert.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.760
In fact,it happened the
same night back in 2004.

23:47.780 --> 23:51.240
According to the file, Joey was shot during
a routine robbery attempt at his apartment.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.340
There's nothing about his
brother being executed in here.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.850
This was no routine robbery.

23:54.860 --> 23:57.680
The man who shot Joey used a silencer.

23:57.690 --> 24:00.970
Look at the file. Not one of his
neighbors reported hearing a gunshot.

24:00.980 --> 24:04.390
Fine. No one heard the gunshot. It wouldn't
be the first time. That proves nothing.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.570
- What's your point?
- I don't know.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.130
It's not really about a point.

24:08.140 --> 24:11.060
I'm just telling you what I know. I'm
just telling you what I saw. I'm just...

24:11.070 --> 24:12.320
I'm trying to help you,Lee.

24:12.330 --> 24:14.410
I appreciate that,Allison,
but honestly...

24:14.420 --> 24:16.590
right now you're just confusing me.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.050
Two nights ago you saw Teddy
Carmichael kill Curtis Lambert.

24:19.070 --> 24:21.420
Last night you saw someone who
worked for Curtis kill Teddy.

24:21.450 --> 24:23.540
Obviously,one of your dreams was wrong.

24:23.550 --> 24:26.670
That means the only thing for me to do
is focus on the things I know for certain.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.350
I got Curtis Lambert's
body in the morgue,

24:28.360 --> 24:30.060
and I have a suspect
in Teddy Carmichael,

24:30.070 --> 24:33.590
a man who,as far as the official
record's concerned, is very much alive.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.890
And I'm gonna keep looking for him
until I find out otherwise. In fact...

24:36.900 --> 24:41.200
I'm on my way over to see his brother
Joey about that very thing right now.

24:41.210 --> 24:43.290
If you want to come.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.090
I don't understand.

24:45.100 --> 24:47.990
You're saying you think Teddy
might have hurt this guy?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.600
We'd like to ask him some questions.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.770
Well, my brother had
nothing to do with this.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.700
He couldn't have. Teddy
lives in Miami now.

24:53.710 --> 24:57.060
If he was coming to
town, he would've told me.

24:58.350 --> 25:00.590
Do you mind if I help?

25:00.600 --> 25:01.440
Yeah,thanks.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.470
Miami? Do you have a phone
number for him? Or an address?

25:05.260 --> 25:07.480
No. He moves around a lot.

25:07.490 --> 25:09.650
When did Teddy move to Miami?

25:09.660 --> 25:11.270
It was a few years ago.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.170
it was right around the
time that I got hurt.

25:16.960 --> 25:21.230
Can you think of the last time that you
actually saw your brother since that night?

25:22.190 --> 25:25.260
He hasn't come to visit for a long time.

25:25.270 --> 25:27.370
Joey,I don't mean to pry.

25:27.380 --> 25:30.580
Can you remember anything about
the night that you were attacked?

25:30.600 --> 25:32.210
Can you remember if Teddy was there?

25:32.220 --> 25:34.190
I don't remember
anything about that day.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.380
My doctor says I probably never will.

25:37.390 --> 25:39.660
Well,that's okay,Joey.

25:39.670 --> 25:42.440
I'm just confused about one thing.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.690
You said you don't have a
phone number for your brother.

25:44.700 --> 25:46.750
Then how do the two
of you keep in touch?

25:46.760 --> 25:49.210
He calls me a couple
times a week at least.

25:49.220 --> 25:52.250
I mean,I just got a
message from him yesterday.

25:52.280 --> 25:54.650
- Can we hear it?
- Yeah.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.900
Hey,kid,it's your big brother.

26:04.910 --> 26:08.050
Listen,don't get nervous if your check's
a day or two late this month,okay?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.720
There's a bank holiday this week.

26:10.730 --> 26:13.560
So,your doctors told me
you're doing great in rehab.

26:13.570 --> 26:15.520
I'm really proud of you.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.860
I'll check in with you in a
couple days,all right? Bye.

26:22.050 --> 26:24.210
Teddy looks out for me.

26:24.610 --> 26:26.580
He always has.

26:29.450 --> 26:33.050
Hey,family guy. It's after 6:00.
When are you getting out of here?

26:33.060 --> 26:34.980
Is it really?

26:34.990 --> 26:38.010
My God,I swear, a
minute ago it was 3:30.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.930
I must like this job.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.990
Well,that makes two of us.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.900
So,good news. Terry Cavanaugh
invited me to come to Albuquerque.

26:45.910 --> 26:47.540
Meet some of their
senior people tomorrow.

26:47.550 --> 26:50.050
I'm flying out first
thing in the morning.

26:50.060 --> 26:53.930
I think they're contemplating
making a major investment.

26:53.940 --> 26:56.840
He really liked what he heard.

27:05.010 --> 27:08.160
You know I'm really starting to
resent this good mood of yours.

27:08.170 --> 27:11.570
Hey,isn't it nice that somebody in
this house is happy in their work?

27:11.580 --> 27:13.720
Besides,I like being
able to pay our bills.

27:13.730 --> 27:15.200
Well,that's great, Mr. Sunshine.

27:15.210 --> 27:17.700
Why don't you shut off
the light and go to bed.

27:17.710 --> 27:20.710
I find all this good cheer depressing.

27:20.720 --> 27:25.070
Now listen, I know this Scanlon
thing has got you frustrated.

27:25.090 --> 27:29.650
And I know that this case got you all confused,
but I think you're looking at this all wrong.

27:29.670 --> 27:33.800
I mean,you ever stop for a minute and, and think
about this from the brother's point of view?

27:35.060 --> 27:38.820
What are you talking about? I have
no idea what you're talking about.

27:38.830 --> 27:41.320
The brother. The one
that you thought was dead?

27:41.330 --> 27:43.260
I mean,I know that you're
upset to hear that he's alive,

27:43.270 --> 27:45.550
but it's got to be good news to him.

27:45.570 --> 27:46.860
Is this a joke?

27:46.870 --> 27:49.140
Is that what we're doing now? Jokes?

27:49.150 --> 27:51.760
Oh,I'm sorry. I didn't know it
was time for the supper show.

27:51.770 --> 27:55.910
If I did,I would have made sure to
turn the ringer off on my cell phone.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.170
You didn't think that was funny?

27:59.180 --> 28:01.490
'Cause I'm just trying to cheer you up.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.910
you know they say a
good mood is contagious.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.450
Yeah,you know what I say? They're wrong.

28:09.460 --> 28:11.730
All right. Love you.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.640
Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.800
Keep it to yourself.

28:19.630 --> 28:22.760
That better not be Coffee
Crunch you're eating.

28:24.090 --> 28:26.780
You know Coffee Crunch keeps you awake.

28:28.730 --> 28:32.440
Come on,Joey,put down the
ice cream and go to sleep.

28:32.450 --> 28:36.120
You're not going to be at your
best until you fall asleep.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.650
That's it.

28:41.080 --> 28:45.720
Off to dreamland,kiddo. Let your
big brother drive for a while.

29:26.610 --> 29:30.380
You've reached Joey Carmichael.
Please leave me a message.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.840
Hey,Joey. It's Teddy.

29:32.850 --> 29:36.640
Just wanted you to know, I'm gonna put a
little something extra in this month's check.

29:36.650 --> 29:40.750
I know our birthday is
coming up, **********

29:45.180 --> 29:46.940
I'm sorry I'm late.

29:46.950 --> 29:49.840
Got tied up talking to the Miami PD.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.990
Teddy Carmichael doesn't have
a registered address there,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.800
but they're going to run his known
aliases and see what turns up.

29:55.810 --> 30:00.190
I get a feeling no matter how hard they
try, Miami PD isn't going to find him.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.610
You said to me the other day
one of my dreams had to be wrong.

30:03.620 --> 30:07.280
Well,I'm starting to think
that both my dreams were right.

30:08.150 --> 30:10.310
Teddy Carmichael is dead.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.230
And he did kill Curtis Lambert.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.100
You aren't saying anything.

30:16.130 --> 30:17.190
What's there to say?

30:17.210 --> 30:19.450
Come on,you've heard those
crazy stories about twins.

30:19.460 --> 30:21.700
How some lady in
Poughkeepsie knows immediately

30:21.710 --> 30:24.010
that her sister in Grand
Rapids got hit by a bus.

30:24.030 --> 30:25.640
Or how they finish
each other's sentences?

30:25.650 --> 30:29.650
Or how some of them speak in some
secret language when they're kids?

30:29.660 --> 30:34.310
And now Teddy is using it to control
his brother to,I don't know...

30:35.640 --> 30:37.370
possess him.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.400
Are you telling me that's
how he killed Curtis Lambert?

30:39.410 --> 30:41.270
I think that's how he
does a lot of things.

30:41.280 --> 30:43.660
I think that's how he
pays Joey's medical bills.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.120
That's how he leaves him messages
to let him know he's okay.

30:48.630 --> 30:49.660
What are you thinking?

30:49.670 --> 30:52.610
I think I'm thinking what
you'd expect me to be thinking.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.770
I'm sorry,Allison. I know you want
to help, but right now, to be honest,

30:55.780 --> 30:59.850
we're spending time I don't
have on theories I can't use.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.200
But I do appreciate it.

31:05.270 --> 31:07.490
- I got it. I got it.
- Whatever.

31:08.330 --> 31:09.070
Hello?

31:09.080 --> 31:11.170
Okay,psychic lady,
guess what I'm thinking?

31:11.180 --> 31:14.080
You're thinking...
"Oh,it's almost dinnertime.

31:14.090 --> 31:16.510
I'm not home yet. Maybe
I should call my wife."

31:16.520 --> 31:18.700
It's amazing how you do that.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.440
Thing is I'm having kind
of a breakthrough here.

31:21.450 --> 31:22.980
Oh,really?

31:22.990 --> 31:26.260
You ever notice how you always have
a breakthrough when it's time to,

31:26.270 --> 31:30.840
uh,feed a child, or bathe a
child or put a child to bed?

31:30.850 --> 31:32.170
Is that true?

31:32.180 --> 31:35.200
Hey,maybe,uh,I should always have a
dirty,hungry, or sleepy child around.

31:35.220 --> 31:39.000
Imagine the new frontiers
I'd be able to conquer. Sorry.

31:39.010 --> 31:42.110
Oh,it's okay. It'll
be my turn one night.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.070
You don't want to do that.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.170
The food'll just sit
in your gut all night.

32:03.180 --> 32:05.810
You'll never get back to sleep.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.430
Sorry if I frightened you.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.230
What do you want?

32:10.240 --> 32:13.010
I want to make you a proposition.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.440
What kind of proposition?

32:15.450 --> 32:19.120
You stop telling people
about my brother and me,

32:19.520 --> 32:23.050
about how I can do whaI
do, and I'll stop doing it.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.000
What are you saying? You're
planning on doing more?

32:26.670 --> 32:31.570
You already killed the man who ordered your
brother's attack, who ordered your execution.

32:31.580 --> 32:34.990
But not the man who pulled
the trigger. Not yet.

32:35.930 --> 32:38.380
So,what do you say?

32:38.390 --> 32:41.400
You stop trying to convince
the police about Joey and me,

32:41.410 --> 32:45.300
and I'll give you my word
nothing will happen to that guy.

32:47.220 --> 32:50.450
I don't believe you.
You are... you're...

32:52.140 --> 32:54.980
you're filled with anger.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.100
You are filled with vengeance.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.910
I can... I can feel it from here.

33:00.920 --> 33:04.730
I never said there wouldn't be vengeance.
I just said I wouldn't kill him.

33:05.960 --> 33:09.350
You're going to send him to jail for me.

33:09.360 --> 33:10.630
For the rest of his life.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.580
I am? For what?

33:12.590 --> 33:15.630
For murdering me,of course.

33:16.810 --> 33:18.860
After he shot me that
night, he buried me.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.230
I can show you exactly where.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.520
You dig me up,you're going
to find bullets in my body

33:23.530 --> 33:26.320
that match the gun
that he's still using.

33:28.170 --> 33:31.630
So do we have a deal, Mrs. Dubois?

33:33.330 --> 33:35.240
That's my husband.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.890
What are you doing up at this hour?

33:43.910 --> 33:47.170
Uh,just... I couldn't sleep.

33:47.180 --> 33:49.190
Missed me,huh?

33:49.200 --> 33:51.810
Well,don't worry. You'll sleep.

33:51.820 --> 33:54.670
I'm tired enough for the two of us.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.080
I'll be right in.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.700
Teddy,if you can hear me...I'm in.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.170
I don't understand.

34:14.840 --> 34:18.920
This can't be Teddy.
That's... That's not Teddy.

34:21.130 --> 34:24.560
I'm sorry,Mr. Carmichael,
but that is your brother.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.170
But he calls me, sends
me money every month.

34:28.179 --> 34:30.750
But he doesn't really call you.

34:31.130 --> 34:32.440
I mean,think about it.

34:32.449 --> 34:35.460
You haven't had a real
conversation in a very long time.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.300
He leaves you messages,recordings.

34:38.670 --> 34:43.070
Joey, your brother loved you very much.

34:43.600 --> 34:47.310
But given the kind of
life that he was leading,

34:47.840 --> 34:51.420
we think that he knew something
was about to happen to him.

34:51.429 --> 34:57.090
So he... he put a system into
place-- the checks, the recordings--

34:57.830 --> 35:01.340
to take care of you in
case the worst happened.

35:01.350 --> 35:03.740
I'm sure this is of little
comfort to you at this moment,

35:03.750 --> 35:07.250
Mr. Carmichael, but we do
have a suspect in custody.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.280
His name's Martin Gibbons.

35:10.290 --> 35:13.520
He worked for a man
named Curtis Lambert.

35:13.850 --> 35:18.520
We have very strong evidence to believe
that he's the man who may have killed Teddy.

35:20.870 --> 35:24.160
He always looked after me, you know?

35:26.470 --> 35:29.270
Who's going to look after me now?

35:34.120 --> 35:39.810
"Sorry we keep missing each other,
"though I suspect I miss you more.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.870
"Terry Cavanaugh is a true believer
"and that has made me realize

35:42.880 --> 35:45.360
"that we are not just
each other's futures...

35:45.370 --> 35:47.850
"we are each other's destinies.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.090
Back soon. Meghan."

35:50.500 --> 35:54.250
Has anyone seen Princess Marie?

35:54.260 --> 35:55.790
I'm looking everywhere for her.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.940
I've come to rescue her.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.820
I'm right here.

36:01.060 --> 36:02.190
Hang on a second.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.630
Uh,I will return to rescue you after
I talk to the dragon on the phone.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.780
Hello?

36:10.790 --> 36:11.950
Sorry to bother you at home,Allison,

36:11.960 --> 36:15.040
but I wanted you to hear this
before it landed on the evening news.

36:15.050 --> 36:17.800
Martin Gibbons was released a
half an hour ago; he made bail.

36:17.810 --> 36:21.330
I thought the bullets in
Teddy's corpse matched his gun.

36:21.340 --> 36:22.680
The preliminary tests say they do,

36:22.710 --> 36:24.680
but we won't have the final
results for about a day

36:24.700 --> 36:28.130
and his lawyer was able
to leverage that for bail.

36:28.140 --> 36:30.930
I'm no happier about this guy sleeping
in his own bed tonight than you are,

36:30.960 --> 36:33.330
but believe me, this
case is as good as closed.

36:33.350 --> 36:35.820
We are going to put this guy away.

36:35.830 --> 36:36.750
Well,I hope you do it soon.

36:36.770 --> 36:40.500
I gave my word to someone that Gibbons
was going to get what he deserves.

36:41.210 --> 36:43.730
- Why are frogs so happy?
- I don't know.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.880
'Cause they eat whatever bugs them.

36:45.890 --> 36:49.400
- Why did the frog say "meow"?
- I don't know.

36:49.410 --> 36:51.870
He was learning a foreign language.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.640
Mm,hey, you're just in time.

36:55.650 --> 36:57.220
Let me get you a plate.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.470
I need to speak to you.

37:03.760 --> 37:08.460
What is this? What am I looking
at? Why are you showing me this?

37:08.470 --> 37:11.250
It's from Meghan.

37:11.950 --> 37:15.010
It's a robe. It's a cashmere robe.

37:15.020 --> 37:17.210
I called the store. It cost $2,200.

37:17.220 --> 37:20.400
I don't care how much it costs.
What is she doing buying you a robe?

37:20.410 --> 37:22.090
I don't know.

37:22.100 --> 37:25.170
Uh,I can't reach her,Allison.
I think she's on a plane.

37:25.180 --> 37:27.760
Yeah? Well, I hope it crashes.

37:27.770 --> 37:28.840
Now,listen, Allison...

37:28.850 --> 37:30.700
And what do you mean "you don't know"?

37:30.710 --> 37:33.720
You're telling me you just work with
someone every day and then suddenly,

37:33.730 --> 37:37.930
out of nowhere,out of the blue,
they buy you a $2,200 robe?

37:37.940 --> 37:40.570
Well,hold on. Hold on a second. Wait.

37:40.580 --> 37:44.100
Come on,I swear to God,
there's nothing going on.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.190
All right,it's crazy. She's crazy!

37:47.200 --> 37:49.830
The other night I'm working
in my office, late,on my own,

37:49.850 --> 37:52.060
and she walks in,she's
all drunk off her ass,

37:52.070 --> 37:53.620
she leaves her boyfriend
to tell me that...

37:53.630 --> 37:56.710
The patent is clear. I know!

37:57.050 --> 37:59.980
I don't want to hear it!
I don't need to hear it!

37:59.990 --> 38:02.740
I already dreamt it! I saw it all!

38:02.750 --> 38:04.260
You did? Then why didn't you tell me?

38:04.270 --> 38:06.890
No! That is not the question!

38:06.900 --> 38:11.870
The question is why didn't you tell me?

38:12.900 --> 38:17.230
When it happened, why
didn't you tell me?

38:27.240 --> 38:28.940
Oh,jeez.

38:30.620 --> 38:33.490
For a minute there I thought
I was looking at a ghost.

38:34.950 --> 38:36.540
I remember you now.

38:36.550 --> 38:38.630
You're Teddy's brother,right?

38:39.470 --> 38:41.630
Well,listen, I don't know what
you've been hearing on the news,

38:41.640 --> 38:44.290
but I had nothing to do with
what happened to your brother.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.340
He was a good guy. I liked Teddy.

38:53.030 --> 38:56.920
So,Joey,you just gonna stand there all
night, or you actually have something to say?

39:17.160 --> 39:18.010
Lee.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.790
You already heard,huh?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.610
Guess he wasn't too happy about
his brother's killer making bail.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.130
Did you talk to him?

39:24.150 --> 39:26.160
No,I tried, but he wouldn't say a word.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.200
Honestly,we don't really need
him to answer our questions.

39:28.210 --> 39:32.290
He did what he did in front of a
restaurant full of eyewitnesses.

39:32.300 --> 39:35.700
I should be going,Allison.
Let's talk in the morning,okay?

39:41.110 --> 39:44.010
You're upset, aren't you?

39:44.330 --> 39:46.410
Don't be.

39:46.420 --> 39:50.440
Oh,don't be upset? You
want me to not be upset?

39:50.450 --> 39:52.160
Then why did you do it?

39:52.170 --> 39:55.830
I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mrs.
Dubois. I didn't do anything.

39:55.840 --> 39:58.350
What happened at that
restaurant tonight was all Joey.

39:58.360 --> 40:01.110
I-I didn't have anything to do with it.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.000
I don't believe you. You're lying.

40:05.010 --> 40:07.180
I wish I was.

40:07.190 --> 40:10.740
I guess Joey thought that he
was looking out for me this time.

40:10.750 --> 40:14.480
Listen,I've to go, but like I
said, you don't have to be upset.

40:14.500 --> 40:18.760
Truth is, Joey's not going to spend one
single second in prison, I promise you.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.770
What are you talking about?

40:20.780 --> 40:22.720
I'm going to take over.

40:22.730 --> 40:25.470
Do his stretch in prison. Keep him safe.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.320
When he finally gets out,it'll
be like he took a long nap.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.900
That's very nice.

40:31.910 --> 40:33.950
We're talking about murder.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.400
What if he gets life?

40:35.410 --> 40:37.940
That's not gonna happen.

40:38.460 --> 40:41.360
You see,Joey killed the
man who killed his brother.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.160
A jury's bound to have
some sympathy for that.

40:43.170 --> 40:45.900
And besides,when they get
a look at his condition...

40:47.210 --> 40:50.790
let's just say I think the
court's gonna be merciful.

40:51.130 --> 40:53.430
Do you think that...

40:53.440 --> 40:55.560
or do you know that?

40:55.570 --> 40:59.430
Nancy Fong is live at the scene
as murder suspect Joseph Carmichael

40:59.440 --> 41:02.230
is transferred to McCarren
State Penitentiary,

41:02.240 --> 41:04.740
where he'll await arraignment.

41:08.300 --> 41:12.120
Mr. Carmichael,rumor has it that the district
attorney is planning to seek the maximum sentence.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.780
Do you have a comment?

41:13.790 --> 41:16.790
Well,honestly, I'm not
so scared of prison.

41:16.800 --> 41:20.050
I think it'll be just
like taking a long nap.

41:42.460 --> 41:44.570
Please don't wake the girls.

41:47.310 --> 41:49.970
I don't know how much you dreamt...

41:51.300 --> 41:54.080
I don't know what you saw...

41:54.980 --> 41:57.570
but nothing happened.

41:57.580 --> 42:00.760
I wouldn't let anything happen.

42:01.140 --> 42:04.070
I could never let anything happen.

42:05.850 --> 42:08.660
You are everything to me.

42:11.330 --> 42:15.070
I'm going to go in there in the morning.
I'm going to tell her there's no company.

42:15.650 --> 42:17.890
Not with me in it.

42:22.080 --> 42:26.030
I'll have another idea.
I'll find another partner.

42:29.820 --> 42:32.350
Best-laid plans,huh?
