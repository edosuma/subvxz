00:13.654 --> 00:15.495
Give me a hand over here!

00:15.581 --> 00:16.778
Right.

00:27.002 --> 00:30.100
I'll be over there. I can't deal with it now.

00:36.596 --> 00:38.885
Right! Load it up in the back!

02:17.329 --> 02:18.836
Hello, Doris.

02:20.124 --> 02:23.256
Wanna do me a favour?
Help me load the next order.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.719
You are no lady, Doris.

02:28.258 --> 02:29.765
Far from it.

03:36.623 --> 03:38.758
Good morning, boys and girls!

03:39.335 --> 03:42.622
Did we all remember
to bring our homework today?

03:47.845 --> 03:49.185
We didn't?

03:50.222 --> 03:54.612
We know what happens to little boys
and girls who don't do their homework.

04:21.423 --> 04:23.262
Okay, class is over.

04:28.097 --> 04:30.102
Do you hear me? Class is over!

04:33.644 --> 04:36.681
Okay, I'm just gonna have to make
another example.

04:52.165 --> 04:54.040
Surprise!

04:55.293 --> 04:57.298
I know you're there, Warwick.

04:57.504 --> 05:00.507
You know something?
You just saved me a trip to your office.

05:00.590 --> 05:04.042
I may be desperate for work,
but not desperate enough to....

08:19.763 --> 08:21.519
Everything's set down here!

08:42.788 --> 08:44.034
Okay, let her rip.

09:24.459 --> 09:26.784
God damn!

09:28.338 --> 09:30.473
<i>Adiรณs</i>, motherfuckers!

09:47.985 --> 09:49.741
Excuse us, please.

09:54.908 --> 09:55.905
Thanks.

09:58.704 --> 10:01.415
Wouldn't mind having his boots
resting under my bed.

10:01.498 --> 10:04.286
One more pair of boots,
you'll have to open a boot shop.

10:04.376 --> 10:06.133
Anyway, he's married.

10:11.719 --> 10:13.724
Daisy May, more coffee.

10:20.603 --> 10:23.949
Daisy May, let's make us a baby doggie-style.

10:30.572 --> 10:34.404
They found him in pieces.
The rats were all over him.

10:34.492 --> 10:36.652
It was really unbelievable.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.548
What have you got in the bag, pal?

10:44.588 --> 10:46.664
Not very friendly, is he?

11:01.022 --> 11:03.098
I bet his mummy packs his lunch.

11:03.566 --> 11:05.642
Peanut butter and jelly.

11:06.069 --> 11:07.825
Without the crust.

11:08.071 --> 11:10.076
Looks like a boy scout to me.

11:11.282 --> 11:13.252
Maybe a girl scout.

11:15.162 --> 11:17.322
See you around, girl scout!

11:17.706 --> 11:21.053
You ought to see who they're hiring.
She's one cute little chick.

11:22.003 --> 11:25.669
<i>The accidental death at Bachman Textile
has opened the restored mill...</i>

11:25.757 --> 11:28.794
<i>to a series of investigations
and probable lawsuits.</i>

11:29.261 --> 11:33.650
<i>Jason Reed was working the night shift
when the mysterious accidents occurred.</i>

11:42.733 --> 11:44.988
- Good morning, Mr. Warwick!
- Hello.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.338
God, this is bad!

12:06.174 --> 12:08.086
Extreme safety hazard.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.688
Exterminator's working round the clock.

12:12.473 --> 12:13.885
He's tired.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.771
- Needs more time.
- There's already been one accident.

12:18.857 --> 12:23.247
This place must be cleared before
another worker steps foot in this death trap.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.608
Damn!

12:33.039 --> 12:34.795
July fourth holiday.

12:37.919 --> 12:40.054
I'll organise a cleanup.

12:41.589 --> 12:43.974
I'll hold on to this till then.

12:50.389 --> 12:51.862
I'll be back.

12:54.186 --> 12:58.612
To be honest, I don't think
you'll find a crew that would work here.

12:58.858 --> 13:00.400
Not down here.

13:01.236 --> 13:02.647
We'll see.

13:27.305 --> 13:29.683
Come shower with me. We can save water.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.557
Get a load of the new guy.

13:33.186 --> 13:34.218
Better get up!

13:41.194 --> 13:43.485
This will work out just fine.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.445
- See you later.
- 'Bye.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.214
'Morning.

13:55.628 --> 13:56.969
Good morning.

14:00.550 --> 14:03.718
Do you take coffee, Mr....

14:03.803 --> 14:06.342
Hall. No, thanks. I'll pass today.

14:09.685 --> 14:10.966
Me, too.

14:11.645 --> 14:14.315
Can't be more than an instant enema by now.

14:21.822 --> 14:24.147
You here by car or by thumb?

14:24.325 --> 14:25.666
By Greyhound.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.663
I see you got a real problem staying put.

14:28.747 --> 14:31.374
Lots of movement over the past five years.

14:31.459 --> 14:34.971
Starts down in Florida,
comes all the way up the map.

14:35.588 --> 14:37.747
Are you on the run, friend?

14:38.049 --> 14:39.888
I'm here for a fresh start.

14:43.512 --> 14:44.853
College boy.

14:46.182 --> 14:48.309
No, that's not the problem.

14:48.392 --> 14:51.062
With all due respect, what is?

14:53.064 --> 14:54.570
Fair enough.

14:58.111 --> 15:00.740
Putting it plainly, Mr. Hall,
you're a drifter.

15:00.823 --> 15:03.451
I get no guarantees with a drifter.

15:03.535 --> 15:06.109
You get no guarantees with any man.

15:06.412 --> 15:07.919
There's only instinct.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.871
You spent some time at Munson Textile.

15:14.837 --> 15:16.677
You ever run the picker?

15:17.048 --> 15:18.258
I know how.

15:18.341 --> 15:21.130
Then you also know it's a one-man operation.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.342
This mill depends on that machine.

15:24.890 --> 15:28.343
And what's left of Gates Falls
depends on this mill.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.684
We don't do better than minimum to start.

15:33.651 --> 15:37.163
Four weeks before the union
comes knocking at your door.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.324
Are you still interested?

15:40.408 --> 15:42.816
- Sounds fair to start.
- All right, then.

15:43.119 --> 15:46.133
That's it, except for the hours.

15:46.373 --> 15:50.134
Because of the heat,
we only run that sucker through the night.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.466
11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

15:54.381 --> 15:56.220
The graveyard shift.

16:17.823 --> 16:19.899
Spread the word, fucker.

16:21.535 --> 16:22.532
Mice.

18:32.051 --> 18:34.211
Damn! That's good shooting.

18:36.431 --> 18:39.314
Tucker Cleveland, Martial Extermination.

18:44.064 --> 18:45.442
John Hall.

18:45.525 --> 18:49.441
Looks like one of your buddies
got a little too close to the blower.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.982
I'd love to know how many
of them beantown executives...

18:53.075 --> 18:56.172
are wearing one of your rat-lined overcoats.

18:59.457 --> 19:02.720
No, thanks. Gave that up with the wife.

19:03.586 --> 19:05.713
I should miss her as much.

19:05.797 --> 19:08.834
- You work late hours.
- I have no choice.

19:09.133 --> 19:12.396
The Yellow Pages are thick with competitors.

19:15.265 --> 19:17.104
I don't mind telling you...

19:19.103 --> 19:21.108
this place is infested.

19:21.690 --> 19:24.067
That may be the understatement of the year.

19:24.150 --> 19:26.403
The schmuck you work for
don't wanna hear that.

19:26.486 --> 19:29.025
Afraid of what it's gonna cost the mill.

19:29.114 --> 19:32.875
He thinks a little tracking poison
will do the trick.

19:33.994 --> 19:36.948
I've been dealing with these things
for more than 20 years...

19:37.038 --> 19:40.799
and we ain't talking about
no candy-ass field mice.

19:42.544 --> 19:45.997
These sons of bitches
piss on tracking poison...

19:46.215 --> 19:49.502
piss on it to warn
their little fucker friends.

19:49.845 --> 19:51.257
Take it from me.

19:51.346 --> 19:55.012
There's only one way to deal with their kind.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.700
On their own terms.

20:09.866 --> 20:14.505
I first met up with them back in Con Tien.

20:17.624 --> 20:20.578
Big as puppies, and they had no fear.

20:21.169 --> 20:24.049
Not of death, nothing, like the Cong.

20:24.132 --> 20:28.511
And I ain't one of them burning-baby,
flashback fuck-ups...

20:28.595 --> 20:31.513
you see Bruce Dern playing,
so quit your grinning.

20:33.391 --> 20:34.555
Anyways....

20:37.104 --> 20:41.115
Conditions being what they were
back then, we had little choice.

20:42.610 --> 20:44.366
We shared the land...

20:45.488 --> 20:48.062
we shared our food with the fuckers...

20:48.157 --> 20:50.910
and they turn around,
stabbing us in the back...

20:50.993 --> 20:53.283
by going to work for the VC.

20:54.748 --> 20:55.994
That's right.

20:56.375 --> 21:01.121
Because the VC would reward them
with a hot meal.

21:04.842 --> 21:08.888
Do you have any idea what a VC rat eats?

21:14.811 --> 21:17.445
Try raw, American...

21:17.647 --> 21:20.364
"Hold the mayo, thank you."

21:23.946 --> 21:25.358
The Cong...

21:26.700 --> 21:29.986
had a way of serving up a meal...

21:30.954 --> 21:33.528
real nice and fancy.

21:35.667 --> 21:39.713
They would stake one of our boys
to the ground...

21:40.171 --> 21:43.209
through his hands, through his feet...

21:45.135 --> 21:47.271
and stake him like Jesus.

21:48.889 --> 21:50.052
And then...

21:52.476 --> 21:56.522
they would make a cut just above the abdomen.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.241
Now, this wasn't a fatal cut.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.488
This was merely an entry wound.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.488
Then, they'd get a rat...

22:09.412 --> 22:12.166
a real hungry rat.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.590
One they hadn't been feeding
for about a week.

22:16.587 --> 22:19.090
And they'd put it on the wound...

22:19.548 --> 22:23.309
and they'd stick its nose down inside.

22:24.094 --> 22:27.013
And if the damned thing
wasn't starving enough...

22:27.431 --> 22:30.385
they'd cover it with a flaming rice bowl.

22:30.476 --> 22:32.437
And let me tell you...

22:32.520 --> 22:36.150
that grey-black son of a bitch...

22:36.234 --> 22:39.152
would have nowhere else to go but inside.

22:40.905 --> 22:42.981
He'd start clawing his way through...

22:43.074 --> 22:46.621
looking to put an end
to that loud beating sound.

22:48.579 --> 22:50.419
Like a human artichoke.

22:50.831 --> 22:53.549
So warm, so juicy.

23:06.349 --> 23:09.232
Maybe I'm a little prejudiced.

23:15.066 --> 23:16.976
Anybody call a break?

23:18.486 --> 23:20.990
No laughing on company hours.

23:22.740 --> 23:26.573
Looks like you just
bought yourself a shift...

23:26.829 --> 23:28.834
scrubbing the latrines.

23:34.920 --> 23:38.754
I should be downstairs humiliating
the college boy by now.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.309
Bravo, Ippeston!

23:43.848 --> 23:46.885
Now we can get you that audition
on <i>Star Search.</i>

23:48.145 --> 23:49.770
Come here, boy.

23:55.819 --> 23:59.580
We got commitments to our
New York sales office due on Wednesday.

24:04.995 --> 24:06.834
Are we on schedule?

24:07.999 --> 24:11.381
- Yes, Mr. Warwick.
- Fetch me the work order, boy.

24:27.394 --> 24:29.364
- 'Evening.
- 'Evening.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.985
How are you tonight?

24:33.317 --> 24:34.942
We're on time.

24:36.947 --> 24:39.272
In fact, we're slightly ahead.

24:41.369 --> 24:43.621
I'm asking about you, Jane.

24:43.704 --> 24:45.176
How are you?

24:46.290 --> 24:49.304
I'm managing, thanks.

24:50.169 --> 24:51.795
You look tired.

24:53.506 --> 24:57.386
Like you're losing too much
of your beauty sleep or something.

24:57.510 --> 25:00.264
The night shift will do that to a girl.

25:08.021 --> 25:11.224
I try to do my job.
Do you have a problem with that?

25:11.441 --> 25:13.603
Who said anything about a deal?

25:15.990 --> 25:18.030
I'm talking about a promotion.

25:19.702 --> 25:22.086
A cool office, a desk!

25:28.545 --> 25:31.333
This cleanup ain't gonna be pretty, darling.

25:32.424 --> 25:35.521
I got Stevenson down there now,
stringing the lights.

25:35.969 --> 25:38.722
He's pissing and moaning about the heat.

25:39.264 --> 25:42.052
- And it's gonna get hotter.
- I can handle it.

25:42.142 --> 25:45.180
It's double pay, so back off, man.

25:45.271 --> 25:48.475
- Why don't you wisen up?
- Like Nardello?

25:52.529 --> 25:55.377
I'm gonna see you down in the basement.

26:29.401 --> 26:33.162
There ain't no way
they'll get this place settled in a week.

26:38.495 --> 26:40.251
Goddamn rats!

26:40.872 --> 26:43.660
This is a whole bunch of bullshit.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.882
Brogan?

26:52.177 --> 26:54.016
Is that you?

26:58.267 --> 26:59.809
Shit.

27:00.310 --> 27:03.325
Very funny! I'm laughing my ass off.

27:05.066 --> 27:06.727
How about picking up a....

27:08.278 --> 27:09.618
Oh, damn.

27:56.705 --> 28:00.334
- So what about Stevenson?
- He left in the middle of the job...

28:00.417 --> 28:02.127
and didn't pick up his pay.

28:02.210 --> 28:04.216
Lookee who's here.

28:05.797 --> 28:07.423
Still alive.

28:11.553 --> 28:15.564
- How you doing? Want some coffee?
- Please, coffee and toast.

28:20.355 --> 28:23.368
We got you a little something to nibble on.

28:24.859 --> 28:25.858
Enjoy.

28:34.746 --> 28:37.630
Special order
for the Commander of the Rat Patrol.

28:58.063 --> 28:59.274
Bastards.

29:16.791 --> 29:18.298
Do you need a lift?

29:44.487 --> 29:46.078
Hi, sweetheart.

29:47.365 --> 29:50.077
Don't wanna be doing that in broad daylight.

29:50.161 --> 29:52.166
Then let's do it in the dark.

29:56.208 --> 29:57.419
Mr. Warwick?

29:57.918 --> 29:59.330
Who wants to know?

29:59.462 --> 30:02.810
Tony Carmichael.
I hear you're looking for a few good men.

30:06.304 --> 30:07.894
Come this way.

30:09.474 --> 30:12.641
I'll talk to you later
about that there thing.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.142
Nice meeting you, ma'am.

30:22.529 --> 30:24.499
Those guys are assholes.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.699
Every town has them.

30:26.784 --> 30:28.744
That's a depressing thought.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.153
- Which town are you from?
- Wheeling.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.261
West Virginia? That's nice.

30:38.631 --> 30:40.758
How about you?
You lived here your whole life?

30:40.841 --> 30:42.843
No way. I'm from Castle Rock.

30:42.927 --> 30:47.138
Castle Rock. Sounds very Norman Rockwell.

30:47.473 --> 30:50.107
No, it's just Castle Rock.

31:01.821 --> 31:03.573
I'll see you around.

31:03.657 --> 31:06.369
You're on the basement cleanup crew,
no doubt.

31:06.452 --> 31:09.205
- Not that I know of.
- You will be.

31:09.289 --> 31:12.836
I know Warwick, and you're a prime candidate.

31:15.128 --> 31:17.347
I bet your wife ain't too thrilled.

31:17.714 --> 31:20.098
Losing you through the night, and all.

31:20.883 --> 31:23.209
We gotta do what we gotta do, right?

31:24.262 --> 31:25.603
My wife's dead.

31:26.390 --> 31:27.731
I'm sorry.

31:30.436 --> 31:32.346
Thank you for the ride.

31:32.813 --> 31:34.095
Take care.

32:06.141 --> 32:09.404
Keep the lights as high up to the ceiling
as possible.

32:11.898 --> 32:15.695
We'll get a water vac in here tomorrow.
Mop this shit up.

32:17.446 --> 32:19.072
Welcome aboard.

33:17.094 --> 33:19.847
You're jumpy, aren't you, kid?

33:23.100 --> 33:25.674
Not to worry. The rats don't bite.

33:33.361 --> 33:35.686
What happened to the fellow
who started this job?

33:35.780 --> 33:37.370
What happened?

33:38.325 --> 33:40.080
He didn't work out.

34:00.098 --> 34:01.890
He needs this typed right away.

34:01.975 --> 34:04.194
- What is it?
- Cleanup crew.

34:04.353 --> 34:06.821
Looks like you made the list, Nardello.

34:16.407 --> 34:18.483
Basement cleanup!

34:19.370 --> 34:21.588
Clean up this, Warwick!

34:25.876 --> 34:29.222
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Where's Warwick?

34:30.672 --> 34:32.049
He's right there.

34:32.132 --> 34:34.292
He's gonna be wicked pissed.

34:53.281 --> 34:55.192
How can you do this to me?

34:56.827 --> 34:59.235
You like it rough, don't you, Nardello?

34:59.329 --> 35:02.995
You can't put me down there.
You can't put anybody down there!

35:03.083 --> 35:04.425
I know things.

35:05.128 --> 35:07.417
What are you talking about?

35:08.589 --> 35:11.050
You better watch what you're saying.

35:11.134 --> 35:12.468
I don't think so.

35:12.552 --> 35:15.969
I think from now on
you better watch what you're saying.

35:33.825 --> 35:36.079
Come on. I'll take you home.

35:38.288 --> 35:39.664
All right.

35:41.082 --> 35:43.087
The show's over.

35:50.675 --> 35:53.429
Everybody go back to doing
what you were doing.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.111
I'm sorry. I thought you were a rat.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.231
You're not the first.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.784
I wanted to drop in and thank you.

38:47.201 --> 38:50.404
Sorry about that situation with Nardello.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.171
Tempers flared.

38:54.542 --> 38:57.888
It was a big misunderstanding.
You know how it is.

39:01.882 --> 39:02.974
Anyway....

39:03.968 --> 39:05.470
As a show of gratitude...

39:05.554 --> 39:09.101
I want to offer you the chance
to earn some extra cash.

39:10.810 --> 39:13.942
Next week is the July fourth holiday.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.349
The mill is shut down.

39:16.983 --> 39:19.308
That means vacation week
for most of our people...

39:19.402 --> 39:21.372
those with the union.

39:22.488 --> 39:24.624
Layoff week for the rest.

39:26.367 --> 39:30.284
But there is work available for a select few.

39:30.998 --> 39:34.759
We got that cleanup thing
going on down in the basement.

39:35.336 --> 39:39.251
Regular graveyard shift hours,
and I'm handpicking the crew.

39:44.305 --> 39:46.381
To tell you the truth...

39:48.726 --> 39:50.861
I've watched you work...

39:52.563 --> 39:54.474
and I like your style.

39:56.334 --> 39:59.182
Gonna be a mess, no doubt about it.

40:00.797 --> 40:04.301
That bastard ain't been touched
since Christ was a kid.

40:04.384 --> 40:06.045
But it's for double pay.

40:07.721 --> 40:11.861
Now you tell me
if an educated guy like you...

40:12.726 --> 40:14.767
can't use double pay.

40:31.205 --> 40:35.250
- Thank you, Mr. Warwick.
- You are so welcome, Mr. Hall.

40:46.889 --> 40:48.301
Hey, Commander.

40:49.767 --> 40:51.048
Hey, rat man.

40:52.603 --> 40:54.857
You must feel awful special.

40:54.980 --> 40:58.326
You're gonna be down in the shit pit
with the rest of us.

40:58.943 --> 41:00.604
I bet he likes your style.

41:00.694 --> 41:03.613
Wait a minute, he said he liked my style!

41:06.910 --> 41:08.191
What's going on?

41:08.286 --> 41:11.300
Guess who finally made
Warwick's cleanup crew?

41:15.127 --> 41:16.598
Congratulations.

41:20.551 --> 41:22.556
Do you want to get out of here?

41:23.595 --> 41:24.723
Yeah.

41:34.149 --> 41:35.395
Thanks.

41:53.752 --> 41:56.601
- You were hungry.
- Yeah, for decent food.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.841
It's been a while.

41:58.925 --> 42:02.437
I worked a spell
as a short order cook in Miami.

42:03.013 --> 42:04.603
Mostly burgers.

42:06.099 --> 42:08.424
I want to hear the rest of your story.

42:08.977 --> 42:13.486
You got married and left Castle Rock
against your father's advice.

42:15.358 --> 42:17.494
Why are dads always right?

42:18.195 --> 42:19.607
I don't know.

42:26.497 --> 42:27.837
Anyway....

42:29.416 --> 42:32.204
It wasn't too long after my divorce...

42:32.294 --> 42:34.584
Warwick came sniffing around.

42:35.297 --> 42:37.706
He said he wanted to help. He felt bad.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.683
So he offered me a promotion
to office manager...

42:41.678 --> 42:45.096
to ease my emotional
as well as financial burdens.

42:45.558 --> 42:47.060
All I'd have to do in return...

42:47.143 --> 42:50.726
was perform a couple of days a week
on the couch in his office.

42:51.147 --> 42:53.152
He even had them picked out.

42:53.817 --> 42:55.693
Monday and Wednesday.

42:56.988 --> 43:00.441
- Son of a bitch.
- Should've brought him up on charges.

43:00.534 --> 43:03.796
I tried, and was advised by Personnel
to see a therapist.

43:11.629 --> 43:13.539
They couldn't get rid of me.

43:13.756 --> 43:18.585
I was saved by the union and the fact
Warwick would look like the shit he is.

43:21.931 --> 43:23.687
So I'm still here.

43:24.183 --> 43:26.319
On borrowed time, I guess.

44:13.153 --> 44:15.906
I bet you hate him, too, Mrs. Warwick.

44:43.144 --> 44:46.562
This will teach you to fire me,
you son of a bitch.

44:49.443 --> 44:50.570
Shit.

45:30.695 --> 45:31.822
Pull.

45:40.248 --> 45:42.158
Do you want to try it?

45:53.636 --> 45:56.265
Leave the ghetto blaster back in the ghetto.

45:56.348 --> 45:57.689
Yes, sir.

45:59.560 --> 46:02.408
Don't want anybody being cute
with one of these.

46:03.564 --> 46:07.515
You'll end up spraying
one of your buddies back onto a slab.

46:09.655 --> 46:13.072
Work areas are listed over there
just like we talked about.

46:14.452 --> 46:17.169
Jobs are split evenly night by night.

46:17.580 --> 46:19.791
Tried to keep it interesting.

46:19.874 --> 46:21.417
Any questions?

46:22.586 --> 46:23.962
Basically...

46:24.046 --> 46:28.091
we need to have this basement
in a workable state by next Thursday.

46:28.175 --> 46:31.188
We only have the chain hoist for one night.

46:31.887 --> 46:35.589
Execute these orders,
you'll get through it without a snag.

46:35.682 --> 46:39.693
And then what happens?
Do we get a gold watch or something?

46:50.366 --> 46:53.154
Sure beats nailing them with soda pop.

47:43.088 --> 47:44.882
What are you doing?

47:52.892 --> 47:55.102
Warwick said to list everything.

47:55.186 --> 47:59.197
Fifty-year-old files are crap.
List them as fifty-year-old crap.

48:00.150 --> 48:02.060
It's not salvageable.

48:24.843 --> 48:26.683
Hey, check this out.

48:28.597 --> 48:30.602
Come on, take a break.

48:31.099 --> 48:34.552
The longer it takes,
the longer we'll be down here doing it.

48:35.938 --> 48:37.943
This thing's in great shape.

49:27.077 --> 49:28.288
Rats.

49:30.038 --> 49:31.510
No problem.

50:02.532 --> 50:04.502
Where are you going, asshole?

50:37.945 --> 50:40.270
You goddamn ignoramus, you almost killed me!

50:40.364 --> 50:43.318
What the hell is your problem, Brogan?

50:43.575 --> 50:45.486
I ain't got a problem.

50:46.412 --> 50:48.168
You got a problem?

51:06.184 --> 51:08.972
Look, guys, this is crazy.

51:10.105 --> 51:13.689
We were hired as a cleanup crew,
not as exterminators.

51:15.361 --> 51:19.905
I need this money as bad as the next guy,
but we are not damn exterminators!

51:20.408 --> 51:22.662
What's your problem, boy?

51:25.163 --> 51:27.915
- We were hired to clean the basement up.
- "We"?

51:32.754 --> 51:34.796
Are you speaking for everybody?

51:35.425 --> 51:36.837
Or just yourself?

51:57.989 --> 51:59.865
Just me, Mr. Warwick.

52:01.202 --> 52:03.172
"Just me, Mr. Warwick."

52:10.253 --> 52:12.923
You'd best be punching out your time card.

52:14.090 --> 52:15.597
Permanently.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.392
Is that clear, boy?

52:32.902 --> 52:34.945
Did somebody call a break?

52:57.096 --> 52:59.730
Control that sack of fleas, Cleveland.

53:00.015 --> 53:01.048
Please.

53:01.141 --> 53:03.218
Moxy, come on over here.

53:03.978 --> 53:08.368
Moxy here is a real special breed.

53:09.192 --> 53:10.782
A rat terrier.

53:12.446 --> 53:16.148
He didn't waste his puppy years
down at the beach...

53:16.242 --> 53:19.160
playing Frisbee with Frankie and Annette.

53:20.830 --> 53:22.906
He was too busy training.

53:23.124 --> 53:26.042
Tracking rats through walls,
through concrete.

53:26.878 --> 53:29.666
Looks to me like he doesn't always win.

53:32.091 --> 53:34.061
Moxy, cut that out!

53:35.721 --> 53:38.983
We've got ourselves a little problem,
you and me.

53:39.225 --> 53:42.228
Our sister mills along the river
don't take too kindly...

53:42.312 --> 53:45.693
to having their backyards
polluted by rat stew.

53:48.651 --> 53:51.570
Our own Mr. Bachman has graciously agreed...

53:51.654 --> 53:54.822
to keep your name
out of any impending lawsuit.

53:56.493 --> 53:58.818
You are legally responsible...

53:59.747 --> 54:02.131
when it comes right down to it.

54:06.045 --> 54:08.370
Ain't you a kick in the nuts.

54:09.590 --> 54:10.801
First off...

54:11.342 --> 54:14.132
I was called personally by Bachman...

54:14.222 --> 54:17.769
and told to pump directly
into the river because...

54:18.267 --> 54:20.901
just between you, me, and Moxy...

54:21.062 --> 54:24.895
he was too cheap
to spring for the dumping charges himself.

54:24.983 --> 54:27.368
I hope you got that in writing.

54:30.489 --> 54:32.950
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you.

54:33.033 --> 54:36.948
This kind of thing can cost you
your exterminator's license.

54:37.287 --> 54:38.759
But again...

54:39.957 --> 54:42.246
no one's naming names.

54:43.335 --> 54:47.287
We're only asking you
to provide one additional service.

54:48.801 --> 54:52.147
I got an idea where them things are nesting.

54:52.721 --> 54:55.604
It shouldn't take you more than a night.

55:15.913 --> 55:18.168
What is it you got me doing?

55:21.127 --> 55:24.330
When was the last time
you been to a graveyard?

55:35.725 --> 55:37.695
Come on, Moxy!

55:38.687 --> 55:41.475
The sooner we find their little home...

55:42.149 --> 55:44.533
the sooner we can get back to ours.

55:54.747 --> 55:58.009
Go on, Moxy, get them.
Eat them for breakfast!

56:34.665 --> 56:36.171
Come on, Moxy.

56:36.750 --> 56:39.467
There just ain't no job worth this.

56:55.187 --> 56:57.263
Ain't no dog worth it, either.

57:53.333 --> 57:55.907
- Just a few more hours.
- I know.

58:17.776 --> 58:19.318
The break's over.

58:20.028 --> 58:21.535
Back to work!

58:22.697 --> 58:25.535
- It's almost over.
- I thought it would never end.

58:25.618 --> 58:28.704
Place still looks like shit.
What do they want to put down here?

58:28.788 --> 58:30.758
- A nightclub.
- Really?

58:32.042 --> 58:34.878
You must've been
at the top of your class, Brogan.

58:34.962 --> 58:37.714
Truth is, they're expanding for offices.

58:37.798 --> 58:40.052
Who would have an office down here?

58:48.684 --> 58:50.156
- Hey!
- What?

58:50.603 --> 58:52.110
Look at this.

58:55.316 --> 58:56.977
What you got, kids?

58:57.318 --> 58:58.790
A trapdoor.

58:59.946 --> 59:01.783
Ain't that interesting?

59:01.867 --> 59:03.528
It certainly is.

59:03.952 --> 59:06.413
That's where your rats are coming from.

59:06.496 --> 59:08.786
They're breeding underground.

59:08.999 --> 59:11.407
You know it all, don't you?

59:12.377 --> 59:13.885
Hey, boys...

59:14.589 --> 59:16.380
come on over here!

59:21.596 --> 59:24.763
- I can't get at it.
- Brogan, give me a hand!

59:33.650 --> 59:35.726
I wonder what's down there.

59:36.236 --> 59:37.958
Fetch a lamp.

59:41.451 --> 59:43.242
You're not thinking of going down?

59:43.328 --> 59:45.902
Me? No, sir.

59:46.706 --> 59:48.917
Johnny's on hoses tonight.

59:49.000 --> 59:52.263
I trust his judgment,
him being a college boy and all.

59:53.129 --> 59:54.541
On one condition.

59:55.256 --> 59:57.795
I'll need an extra body
to help me carry the line.

59:57.884 --> 59:59.509
Name your body.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.437
You, Mr. Foreman.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.780
The management should be represented
in this little adventure.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:18.240
Don't you think?

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:22.988
In case there is buried treasure,
I don't want to be accused of stealing.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:26.201
You first.

01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:28.992
I'll be right after you.

01:00:30.545 --> 01:00:31.956
I'm going.

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:40.521
Danson, Carmichael, come on, get up!

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:42.843
Brogan, you too!

01:00:44.727 --> 01:00:47.824
At Bachman we're just one big happy family.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:54.661
Yeah, the Manson Family.

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:20.731
You all right?

01:01:22.518 --> 01:01:25.187
Let's go over there to set you down.

01:01:26.188 --> 01:01:27.470
Come on.

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.691
Brogan, watch your step.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.780
What the hell have we got here?

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:45.887
A bygone power source. Water power.

01:01:46.252 --> 01:01:48.504
Looks like it hasn't worked in years.

01:01:48.588 --> 01:01:52.759
Smells like stale piss down here.
I say we turn around right now.

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:55.630
So much for your breeding ground, Hall.

01:01:56.471 --> 01:01:58.013
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

01:02:11.737 --> 01:02:14.311
Brogan, you're a regular bug light.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:02.370
I see him!

01:03:04.128 --> 01:03:06.097
Grab hold of the wood!

01:03:08.591 --> 01:03:10.252
I'm coming down!

01:03:16.892 --> 01:03:18.683
There's something down here!

01:03:18.768 --> 01:03:20.110
Hold on!

01:03:24.483 --> 01:03:25.860
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.614
- There he is!
- Please help me!

01:03:32.033 --> 01:03:33.374
Come on.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.836
He's dead. Brogan's dead!

01:03:52.139 --> 01:03:54.358
Shut up, Carmichael!

01:03:58.062 --> 01:03:59.604
Give me that.

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:31.386
We can use these for weapons.

01:04:33.433 --> 01:04:36.008
Something our friend Hall hasn't got.

01:04:36.687 --> 01:04:39.190
I'll deal with her and Hall.

01:04:40.107 --> 01:04:42.734
Fuck Hall. Forget about Hall.

01:04:42.818 --> 01:04:46.330
Start thinking about
whatever the hell is down here.

01:04:47.239 --> 01:04:49.149
He found the opening.

01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:53.528
He brought us down here.

01:04:55.582 --> 01:04:58.501
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for him.

01:05:02.548 --> 01:05:05.122
So don't go telling me my business.

01:05:06.302 --> 01:05:08.710
You're going out of your mind, Warwick.

01:05:08.929 --> 01:05:11.717
You just stood there and watched Brogan die.

01:05:13.893 --> 01:05:15.364
You didn't.

01:05:23.904 --> 01:05:25.066
Move.

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.831
It's a dead end.

01:05:41.049 --> 01:05:43.588
There must be some other way out of here.

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.436
Wait, listen.

01:05:51.059 --> 01:05:52.601
Wait a second!

01:05:57.273 --> 01:05:59.349
There's gotta be a way out.

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:15.949
Here. Grab ahold of this.

01:06:35.482 --> 01:06:37.273
Which way do we go?

01:06:43.574 --> 01:06:45.033
What do you have there?

01:06:45.117 --> 01:06:46.956
Water. Pretty loud.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.076
Do you hear it?

01:06:53.751 --> 01:06:55.662
Sounds like the river.

01:06:56.129 --> 01:06:58.264
I knew this was a way out.

01:06:58.631 --> 01:07:01.645
It's your moment, Carmichael. You go first.

01:07:02.802 --> 01:07:05.473
Go on. We'll be right in back of you.

01:07:16.151 --> 01:07:17.813
There's a hole here.

01:07:24.952 --> 01:07:26.957
I think we can break through.

01:07:30.166 --> 01:07:31.507
It's wet.

01:07:35.296 --> 01:07:37.299
Something's got my arm!

01:07:37.382 --> 01:07:38.723
Help me!

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.002
What is it?

01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:43.504
Help me! Something's got my arm!

01:07:47.393 --> 01:07:48.900
Danson, move!

01:07:49.229 --> 01:07:51.364
Please, somebody help me!

01:07:54.651 --> 01:07:55.861
Move!

01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:06.836
It's blocked!

01:08:07.373 --> 01:08:08.535
Wait!

01:08:25.015 --> 01:08:26.393
The river!

01:08:30.606 --> 01:08:31.888
Help me!

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:36.559
Help me!

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:48.881
All right, now.

01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:56.707
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

01:08:57.595 --> 01:09:00.134
No more! No more!

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.269
I'm not going! I'm not going anymore!

01:09:05.352 --> 01:09:07.144
Do you want to die?

01:09:07.813 --> 01:09:09.818
I'm not going anywhere!

01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:14.158
It ain't that bad.

01:09:29.754 --> 01:09:31.095
It's ice cold.

01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.595
I'm very close.

01:09:39.971 --> 01:09:42.192
We'll never get through that way.

01:09:42.768 --> 01:09:44.808
At least not with that thing.

01:10:43.041 --> 01:10:44.323
Help me!

01:11:30.092 --> 01:11:32.168
We're going to make it.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:34.467
I know.

01:11:36.766 --> 01:11:38.842
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:05.422 --> 01:12:07.713
This must be where it lives.

01:12:21.064 --> 01:12:22.820
Come on, let's go.

01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:38.005
Mr. Foreman.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.660
Come on, let's lift him up.

01:12:45.215 --> 01:12:48.632
- It's really bad.
- We should let the bastard bleed.

01:12:49.344 --> 01:12:51.136
Hold this for a second.

01:14:26.866 --> 01:14:28.077
Here!

01:16:25.704 --> 01:16:28.966
We are going to hell.

01:16:37.425 --> 01:16:39.833
Together!

01:20:46.111 --> 01:20:48.994
There's only one way
to deal with these fuckers.
