00:18.685 --> 00:19.853
[cell phone vibrates]

00:23.231 --> 00:24.065
What the fuck?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.150
[cell phone chimes]

00:27.736 --> 00:29.028
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.113
[cell phone chimes]

00:31.906 --> 00:33.992
Motherfucker.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.160
[Tom] "Criminal past"?

00:35.243 --> 00:38.163
A local reporter in San Antonio
posted the story last night--

00:38.246 --> 00:40.623
Seth, skip to the "criminal past" part.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.334
When he was 16 years old,
so this is in 1996,

00:43.418 --> 00:47.589
Aaron illegally transported
a undocumented child

00:47.672 --> 00:50.341
named Mariluz Santiago
across the United States border.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.387
-We didn't know about this?
-No, it didn't show up in the vet.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.183
Get everybody in the Oval. Now.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.268
[theme music playing]

01:06.191 --> 01:08.276
The FBI considers the matter closed.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.986
Oh, you can't be surprised by that.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.947
Their operational budget
has a line item for bows.

01:14.699 --> 01:17.327
They like to tie up their cases with them.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.287
I got it, Hannah.
I just didn't find it amusing.

01:19.370 --> 01:22.040
It's a lot more complicated
than they think.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.875
-There are loose ends.
-[Eli] Right.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.753
So, our racist friends
in Reclaim Our Nation,

01:26.836 --> 01:29.881
which, I have to say,
very catchy name for an ethnostate,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.300
they were trafficking
in biological compounds

01:32.383 --> 01:35.386
synthesized at the DIY labs
we found in Cambridge and Tampa.

01:35.470 --> 01:38.932
-So, where did the pieces come from?
-The pieces?

01:39.015 --> 01:41.935
The components. The little genetic bits
they CRISPR together

01:42.018 --> 01:44.354
into their diabolical custom bugs.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.689
They come from a company called Genetical.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.108
The point is,
the bits weren't ordered by the lab.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.612
They were ordered by another business,
a brewery north of Boston.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.491
And you think, what, that this brewery
is some sort of clearinghouse?

01:56.574 --> 01:58.326
That they send the bits to the lab?

01:59.327 --> 02:00.954
It merits further investigation.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.789
Okay, check it out.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.626
If we're moving
beyond domestic terrorists,

02:07.293 --> 02:09.712
I can speak to a friend
who may have some insight

02:09.796 --> 02:11.840
into who's ringleading this operation.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.342
What were you thinking?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.302
Sir, I was a teenager.
I did what my aunt asked--

02:16.386 --> 02:18.680
I'm not talking about then,
I'm talking about now.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.974
You know better.
Why keep this to yourself?

02:21.057 --> 02:22.725
-It's the height of--
-He told me.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.354
-And I told him to keep it to himself.
-You told him what?

02:28.064 --> 02:30.900
Please, don't blame her.
This is on me. I made the call.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.319
You don't get to make the call
about a subject like that.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.613
We also have a problem
with mixed messages.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.950
The president just deported a family
for entering the country illegally,

02:39.033 --> 02:41.494
and you've become the poster boy
for open borders.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.580
Mr. President,
I should resign from the ticket.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.832
-We'll see how the speech goes.
-Speech?

02:45.915 --> 02:49.460
We've advised that you'll make an address
at 9:00 p.m. from the East Room.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.379
It'll preempt local news
on the West Coast.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.673
-All the cables will carry it live.
-This is meant for what?

02:53.756 --> 02:55.341
To give you the opportunity

02:55.425 --> 02:58.261
to deliver a convincing mea culpa
to the country.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.430
So this unrepentant thing you got going,

03:00.513 --> 03:03.975
you better smooth it over
with contrition ASAP.

03:04.058 --> 03:06.603
I suggest you get to work. That's all.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.023
Emily.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.358
Yes, sir.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.236
I need you to write two statements.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.655
One if Aaron stays on the ticket,
one if he goes.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.908
While you're at it,
draft your own resignation letter.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.702
I'll let you know if I need it later. Go.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.046
Am I overreacting here?

03:33.129 --> 03:35.298
No, not at all.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.010
Unforced errors. [sighs]

03:40.053 --> 03:41.429
Goddamn unforced errors.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.058
How's Lynn?

03:47.810 --> 03:49.520
Better, sir.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.023
-She still in the hospital?
-Yes.

03:52.106 --> 03:54.359
But she regained consciousness last night,

03:54.442 --> 03:56.861
so looks like
she's through the worst of it.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.572
Okay, good. Keep me posted.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.824
I will. Thank you, sir.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.831
What should I say? "I'm sorry for bringing
a contributing member of society

04:08.915 --> 04:12.168
into our country that's filled
with natural-born, entitled assholes

04:12.252 --> 04:14.254
who take their citizenship
and privilege for granted."

04:14.337 --> 04:16.839
-Well, I wouldn't lead with that.
-Shit.

04:16.923 --> 04:21.302
Look, if it's me, I don't think
you did anything wrong.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.805
I don't think you have anything
to be ashamed of.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.517
But this?
This is the definition of a wedge issue.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.227
-Jesus.
-But you gotta take care

04:29.310 --> 04:32.605
not to be so hard-line
as to alienate the liberal base.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.983
But then, you gotta be
just hard-line enough

04:35.066 --> 04:38.319
to convince Independents
you're not overly lenient on immigration.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.990
-You need me?
-No, her.

04:43.783 --> 04:44.867
You got this.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.710
-Mr. President.
-You wanted to see me?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.753
Sasha, please, come and sit down.

04:56.337 --> 05:00.758
The Capitol Police told me about
the incident at the women's washroom.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.635
Why didn't you come talk to me?

05:03.386 --> 05:07.849
Why? This kind of thing happens
all the time. No one cares.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.768
Moss does. His surrogates
are in the middle of a TV blitz

05:10.852 --> 05:13.104
trying to spin the incident in his favor.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.523
-Please stop using that word.
-What word?

05:16.232 --> 05:19.694
"Incident." It wasn't an incident.
This is my life.

05:19.777 --> 05:21.863
It's all the more reason
why we need to push back.

05:21.946 --> 05:23.281
Who's "we"?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.533
You.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.161
[scoffs] Absolutely not.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.621
I can only imagine how difficult this is.

05:32.707 --> 05:36.878
Didn't you just give a speech
extolling the virtues of privacy?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.255
What was your point?
That everyone has a right to privacy

05:39.339 --> 05:42.592
-except when it's convenient for you?
-Sasha, this isn't about me.

05:42.675 --> 05:47.221
That's right, it's about me.
And my answer is no.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.768
-Is there anything else?
-No.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.728
I'm sorry. Thank you very much.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.236
I know I'm looking at this
from the outside in,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.572
but we need to do something.
Figure out a way to respond.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.032
Yes, sir.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.245
[sighs]

06:14.999 --> 06:16.209
[knock on door]

06:16.292 --> 06:17.293
[Aaron] General Kellogg.

06:17.376 --> 06:21.214
I have a potential national security issue
I need to bring to your attention.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.131
All right.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.050
Two NORAD F-22s intercepted

06:24.133 --> 06:28.805
a couple of Russian Tu-95 Bear bombers
in our Air Defense Identification Zone.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.223
And where exactly is that?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.600
Little bit south of Kodiak Island
in the Gulf of Alaska.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.145
If the Tu-95s continue
on their current course,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.731
and that is a big if,

06:38.815 --> 06:41.067
they'll overfly Seattle
in just three hours.

06:41.150 --> 06:44.612
And normally, they turn around
before they give us too much heartburn,

06:44.695 --> 06:46.823
but we'll monitor this from the Sit Room.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.117
I'm coming with you.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.286
I wanna see if there's anything we can do

06:52.370 --> 06:55.039
with that march-in clause
from the Bayh-Dole Act.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.625
Great. What do you have in mind?

06:57.708 --> 07:00.461
No federal agency
ever exercised its oversight

07:00.545 --> 07:03.840
in stripping these Big Pharma bastards
of their patents.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.717
We shouldn't be using this clause
as a scalpel.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.594
We should be using it as a cudgel.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.139
Well, I can get in touch
with my contact at NIH.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.432
See what other licenses
might be reclaimable, get you--

07:13.516 --> 07:18.521
Yeah, I'd prefer to look
at a specific company. FlagKind.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.607
Find out where they're vulnerable,
then let's go after them.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.652
Any reason why
we're only focusing on FlagKind?

07:24.735 --> 07:28.281
Because I asked you to.
Let me know what you come up with.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.916
Manufacturing sector
doesn't look to be thriving here.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.711
It's not their profit margin
I'm interested in.

07:42.420 --> 07:44.839
Never been a fan of domestic brews.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.843
Unless we're talking craft beers,
in which case, you can count me in...

07:49.760 --> 07:51.596
Unrelenting delight, she is.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.726
[Tom sighs] <i>So, where are we?</i>

07:56.809 --> 07:59.937
Why wasn't Aaron honest with us?
We could've managed the story.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.773
True. But whatever you decide,
you gotta do it fast.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.610
Decisiveness is key here.
Especially when your opponents

08:05.693 --> 08:08.446
are characterizing you
as ineffectual and irresolute.

08:08.529 --> 08:11.699
"Ineffectual and irresolute."
I get that from the Moss campaign.

08:11.782 --> 08:15.077
I don't get why the press isn't writing
that during my presidency,

08:15.161 --> 08:19.332
I successfully navigated a hostage crisis,
dealt with terrorists, natural disasters.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.791
Hell, even the Congress.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.877
Not to mention,
rebuilt the United States government

08:22.960 --> 08:26.339
after an unprecedented disaster.
What the hell do they want from me?

08:26.422 --> 08:29.634
Could you rescue a baby
from a burning building, please?

08:30.635 --> 08:31.552
[knock on door]

08:32.136 --> 08:35.598
Mr. President. We have a problem.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.227
One of the Tu-95s split off
ten minutes ago,

08:39.310 --> 08:40.978
-headed back towards Russia.
-One of them?

08:41.062 --> 08:44.732
It's unprecedented, sir.
They do these runs in pairs.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.609
What's your assessment?

08:46.692 --> 08:50.238
The F-22s stayed on the tail
of our rogue Bear.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.534
They reported
the windshield is dark and iced up.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.537
We waved our wings to communicate
with the Russian crew,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.205
but we got no response, sir.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.041
They're not attacking us with one plane.
That doesn't make sense.

09:02.124 --> 09:03.834
You think something's happened
to the crew?

09:03.918 --> 09:05.503
That's our best guess, sir.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.673
We're assuming their supplemental
oxygen failed and they blacked out.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.468
So, best case scenario,
crew is incapacitated, not waking up.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.595
Tell me about the weapons system
on the Tu-95.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.473
If the nukes are live and it hits Seattle,

09:17.557 --> 09:20.977
we're looking at a high estimation
of 250,000 dead.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.646
And, sir, the plane is an hour away
from US mainland.

09:23.729 --> 09:27.149
If we want to shoot it down,
we need to do it over water, and now.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.609
We're not shooting down a Russian plane,

09:28.693 --> 09:31.112
even if the crew's dead,
until we talk to Moscow.

09:31.195 --> 09:33.990
Use the hotline. Tell them I need to speak
to their president.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.032
Yes, sir.

09:38.911 --> 09:39.829
Shit.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.668
<i>This is another example of an unprepared,</i>
<i>oblivious, accidental president</i>

09:45.751 --> 09:49.338
<i>who's letting the terms dictate him,</i>
<i>instead of him dictating the terms.</i>

09:49.422 --> 09:52.550
<i>Cornelius Moss has the necessary</i>
<i>experience to lead the American...</i>

09:52.633 --> 09:54.468
[Lorraine] Hey,
have you finished your speech?

09:54.552 --> 09:55.803
[Aaron] I'm in the middle of something.

09:55.886 --> 09:59.515
I'm in the middle of something, too.
It's called a presidential campaign.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
Which we're currently losing,
no small thanks to you.

10:01.684 --> 10:05.521
I'm also the national security advisor,
and right now, that takes precedence.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.190
[stutters and sighs]

10:09.275 --> 10:10.443
Hey.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.194
[Emily] Hey, if you need your office,
I can go.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.573
No, stay. I'm looking forward
to visiting you in Hatch Act jail.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.450
Just don't snoop in my top drawer.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.868
Oh, hey, no, hold on there.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.122
This is an unreasonable amount
of fidget spinners.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.750
Seth, I...
These aren't even a thing anymore.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.085
-You have a problem.
-I have a lot of problems.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.046
Um, do you know what's happening
in the Sit Room?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.173
-Seems like there's commotion afoot.
-No idea.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.175
I've been cooped up in here
trying to find an eloquent way

10:34.258 --> 10:37.678
to potentially end my friend's
political career, as well as my own.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.806
-He's not gonna fire you.
-You sure? Because I would fire me.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.060
[exhales heavily]

10:44.143 --> 10:45.394
What?

10:45.936 --> 10:50.149
Moss and his goons, they're already
all over cable news with this Sasha thing.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.277
They're making it seem like
she's some sort of liberal scourge.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.988
They're deadnaming her,
using her pretransition name.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.282
I didn't even know
what that was until today.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.575
I don't see the problem.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.869
Get her on some talk shows,
do a newspaper interview,

11:01.952 --> 11:04.747
slap her on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair,</i>
put those assholes in their place.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.916
She's a private person.
She doesn't wanna be in the limelight.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
I know that, and I know she doesn't.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.755
This might sound a little bitchy,
but maybe she should get out of it.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.050
-That's not exactly fair.
-You're right, it isn't fair.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.387
But what also isn't fair is that there are
millions of people suffering in silence

11:19.470 --> 11:22.306
because they don't have the privilege
of being the president's sister-in-law.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.808
It's hard to sympathize with someone

11:23.891 --> 11:27.269
whose voice could make an impact
and just chooses not to use it.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.315
-Speaking of privilege...
-Sorry.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.401
Okay. So how do I get her to use it?

11:33.901 --> 11:37.029
I don't know. You are so skilled
in the art of persuasion.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.406
Persuade.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.784
Can I get back to work now?

11:42.451 --> 11:44.078
Yeah. Only just, uh...

11:44.161 --> 11:46.664
-Don't. God.
-I have to. It's an addiction.

11:46.747 --> 11:49.083
2018 called, wants its toy back.

11:49.166 --> 11:53.129
Mars? Hey. I did a quick vet
on FlagKind's product line.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.255
And?

11:54.338 --> 11:57.591
They were all generated in-house
with proprietary R&D,

11:57.675 --> 11:59.176
no federal funding.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.804
So, none of them would be subject
to march-in rights.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.097
Maybe another company?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.683
Not another company, this company.

12:05.766 --> 12:09.520
If you can't get me what I need,
I'll take care of this myself.

12:25.744 --> 12:26.871
Can I help you, miss?

12:27.788 --> 12:29.707
[Hannah] I was hoping
to speak to a manager.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.793
Uh, we don't have a manager,
strictly speaking.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.920
More of an informal operation.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.049
I'm the brewmaster, though,
so I suppose I got seniority.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.426
So this is your place?

12:40.509 --> 12:42.052
Mine enough.
Been in the family for generations.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.014
Have you guys purchased
specialized materials

12:45.097 --> 12:46.932
from a company called Genetical?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.100
Where are you from?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.894
Department of Health and Human Services.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.605
Why would you have ordered a shipment

12:52.688 --> 12:54.940
containing genetic components
of the smallpox virus?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.568
Smallpox? Didn't they wipe that
off the face of the earth?

12:57.651 --> 12:59.028
[chuckles]

12:59.111 --> 13:02.907
Look, I've ordered from Genetical before,
but nothing hazardous like you say.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.034
Synthetic hops,
pieces to put 'em together.

13:05.117 --> 13:08.329
-Brilliant. A GMO beer?
-Yeah, we're working on it.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.455
Future of the industry.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.209
Sensible, eco-conscious, saves water,
makes room for more essential crops.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.837
Yes. My grandfather would hate to hear it,
but it tastes better, too.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.464
I stopped buying from Genetical.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.217
Customer service is terrible.
Shipping's a mess.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.135
I'm not surprised they made a mistake.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.764
Thanks for your time. Sorry to bother you.

13:26.847 --> 13:27.681
[brewmaster] It's no bother at all.

13:31.143 --> 13:34.897
Hey, you know who you could get
to endorse your beer when it comes out?

13:34.980 --> 13:35.814
Gronk.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.444
-Gronkowski.
-Oh, yeah, great idea.

13:40.528 --> 13:44.031
Right? I mean, he'll shill for anyone.
[chuckles] Go Pats.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.033
Go Pats.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.998
Guy grew up north of here, he doesn't
ride for the Patriots? Right.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.168
And your Patriots
are American footballers, yeah?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.922
And this Gronk is some kind
of beloved regional champion?

14:00.005 --> 14:03.926
Oh, yeah. And if you grew up here,
it's your religion.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.390
That thing he said about
Genetical's record-keeping being a mess,

14:09.473 --> 14:11.642
-that sound credible to you?
-Doubtful.

14:11.725 --> 14:14.645
Most of us in this racket
have a touch of the OCD.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.439
My mate in Genetical's chronically anal.

14:17.523 --> 14:21.402
[chuckles] That last bit sounded
almost Gilbert and Sullivan, didn't it?

14:22.278 --> 14:25.281
Just check with your mate.
And when the day's done,

14:25.364 --> 14:27.783
I'll come back here
and give it a shakedown.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.287
-You love this, don't you?
-Hmm?

14:33.080 --> 14:36.792
Thrill of the chase,
the charge of the hunt, all that?

14:37.793 --> 14:40.713
Yeah, I guess I do.

14:40.796 --> 14:44.133
The Russian minister of defense
is on the hotline. General Golovin.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
-General Golovin.
<i>-Mr. President.</i>

14:48.012 --> 14:51.348
Within minutes, one of your bombers
is going to enter our airspace.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.309
If you don't intervene,
we will have to shoot it down.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.227
[Golovin] <i>We have the situation</i>
<i>under control.</i>

14:55.311 --> 14:57.104
It doesn't look like that
from our vantage point.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.188
What are you doing?

14:58.272 --> 15:01.859
<i>-I am not authorized to discuss that.</i>
-You better start.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.485
We're running out of time.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.446
Have you remotely disarmed
the nukes onboard?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.990
<i>Like the United States,</i>
<i>the Russian Federation</i>

15:08.073 --> 15:11.368
<i>neither confirms or denies</i>
<i>the presence of nuclear weapons</i>

15:11.452 --> 15:12.870
<i>on its planes or submarines.</i>

15:12.953 --> 15:14.538
You better tell your president

15:14.622 --> 15:17.583
you've got ten minutes to deal
with this bomber, or we will.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.878
<i>It is your decision, Mr. President,</i>
<i>as it is your airspace.</i>

15:20.961 --> 15:23.339
<i>Do what you will,</i>
<i>but tread very carefully.</i>

15:24.548 --> 15:25.466
Son of a bitch.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.843
-They're embarrassed by the situation.
-They should be.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.678
There's an alternative
we haven't discussed yet.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.513
You're waiting till now to tell me that?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.557
It's quite outside the box.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.976
But we need to bring Cyber Command
into the conversation.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.605
-They could help us out here.
-Bring 'em in. Where the hell is Mars?

15:52.242 --> 15:53.410
[door opens]

15:54.870 --> 15:58.082
Mr. Harper, the commissioner's ready.
He apologizes for the wait.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.960
No harm, no foul.
Commissioner Richter.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.712
I'd say the hold-up was urgent,
but I worry you'd take offense.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.130
-How do you mean?
-Just wrapped a call

16:05.214 --> 16:08.175
on baby reptiles and salmonella.
Not in the public job description.

16:08.258 --> 16:10.886
Seems that nothing is
these days. [chuckles]

16:11.762 --> 16:13.555
Thanks for taking the time.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.975
If this has something to do
with my handover,

16:16.058 --> 16:18.227
I've compiled a list
of possible candidates.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.647
You know, mostly some former advisors,
some equitable policy--

16:21.730 --> 16:23.399
This has nothing to do
with your succession.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.527
-Then what can I do for you?
-FlagKind.

16:27.736 --> 16:28.779
What about them?

16:28.862 --> 16:32.866
Their new drug up for approval?
Rumor has it that it's in clinical trials.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.743
Correct, it is.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.870
How's that looking for Jordan Flagg?

16:37.621 --> 16:40.207
I'm assuming the FDA's
gonna continue its tradition

16:40.290 --> 16:43.544
of granting his products
fast-track treatment?

16:43.627 --> 16:46.130
Mr. Harper, I... [chuckles]

16:46.797 --> 16:50.676
You know this. I can't discuss
an ongoing review process.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.594
-I mean, it would be--
-Unethical?

16:53.220 --> 16:58.183
As unethical as manufacturing a drug
that addicts more than two million people,

16:59.560 --> 17:02.604
and then creating another
to counteract that addiction?

17:04.398 --> 17:08.193
This discussion could land each of us
in a good bit of trouble.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.907
I think it's in both of our best interests
that we end it here.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.076
As a matter of courtesy,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.954
I'll forget we spoke
more than two words between us.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.503
Thank you, Commissioner.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.142
[indistinct chatter on TV]

17:42.811 --> 17:44.063
Are you loitering?

17:45.814 --> 17:49.068
I would prefer
that we called it "attractively idling."

17:49.151 --> 17:51.153
I'm waiting to finish a conversation
with the president.

17:51.236 --> 17:55.449
We were interrupted by a situation
in the Situation Room.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.451
-Any intel?
-I'm afraid not.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.369
Have you seen Emily?

17:59.453 --> 18:01.955
-Yeah, she's in my office, suffering.
-Hmm.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.792
[Phil on TV]<i> It seems to me that</i>
<i>Mr. Kirkman is a weak and willing factotum</i>

18:04.875 --> 18:07.294
<i>to the most extreme liberal influencers</i>
<i>in our country,</i>

18:07.377 --> 18:10.589
<i>with Mr. Shore acting as sponsor</i>
<i>to Mexican invaders</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:14.885
<i>and Mr. Kirkman's former brother-in-law</i>

18:17.137 --> 18:19.014
<i>Now, Cornelius Moss has not forgotten</i>

18:19.098 --> 18:21.642
<i>the normal, hard-working,</i>
<i>traditional-minded Americans...</i>

18:22.351 --> 18:24.812
Son of a bitch, motherfucker,
piece of shit, cunt.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.438
Sorry.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.066
I wouldn't change a word.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.698
Dianne. Who never calls me anymore.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.742
You're in the private sector now, Dov.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.911
We have nothing to share.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.498
Oh, no, no, no, I still have
so much to share with you, <i>motek.</i>

18:44.581 --> 18:46.834
-Down, boy.
-Well, once he gets up,

18:46.917 --> 18:50.295
it is so very difficult
to put him down again. But you know this.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.882
I have a question,
one that could benefit from your

18:54.716 --> 18:57.469
-invaluable expertise.
-Of course.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.559
Scientists involved in chemical
and biological weapons programs

19:03.642 --> 19:06.353
back in the day, who's still in the game?

19:06.436 --> 19:09.231
You could have gone
to the British for answers,

19:09.314 --> 19:12.651
the Canadians, the Australians. Why me?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.613
It's an open secret
that Israel helped South Africa

19:16.697 --> 19:18.240
with their nuclear program in the '90s.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.617
Less of an open secret
that your government

19:20.701 --> 19:23.829
may have also helped them
with their bioweapons research.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.958
Specifically, their racially-targeted
bioweapons research.

19:28.542 --> 19:32.087
Yes, you're referring
to their Project Coast.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.715
We knew about it, of course,
but it wasn't our affair.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.384
Surely Mossad kept tabs on the principals.

19:38.218 --> 19:42.890
So, again, who's still in the game?

19:43.682 --> 19:46.643
The only one from Project Coast
that we lost track of

19:46.727 --> 19:49.188
was a man named Wouter Momberg.

19:50.063 --> 19:53.317
Sickest of the lot if you ask me.
He could be dead,

19:53.400 --> 19:55.569
could have faked his death,
could be in the wind.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.530
-Do you have a most recent trace?
-I can get it for you.

19:59.740 --> 20:01.325
Thank you.

20:01.408 --> 20:05.621
[clears throat] You know, in the old days,

20:05.704 --> 20:08.332
you would have straddled me
for information like this.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.919
Well, let's just see
how this plays out, <i>Liebchen. </i>

20:20.886 --> 20:23.222
[sighs] I'm sorry, I should've told you.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.349
I'm not the one you owe the apology to.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.936
Although, you know, sort of, I am.
How are those statements coming?

20:29.019 --> 20:31.063
-[cell phone rings]
-Sorry.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.940
Hello, what's wrong?

20:34.983 --> 20:37.110
Well, can you, I don't know, make her eat?

20:38.278 --> 20:42.532
I understand. Okay. I don't know exactly,
but tell her as soon as I can.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.034
Thank you.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.871
[exhales heavily]

20:48.956 --> 20:50.749
Okay, I'm only gonna say this once,

20:50.832 --> 20:54.378
and if I'm asked about it under oath,
I will probably deny,

20:54.461 --> 20:55.754
but sometimes...

20:57.214 --> 20:58.966
family takes priority.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.593
And it sounds like
this is one of those times.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.807
Take it from the lady who's
in the home stretch of her third divorce.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.976
What about these? I have to finish them.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.727
Yeah, I'll finish those up.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.646
What? I need something to do.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.482
Thank you.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.778
Oh. Yeah, let's not do that.

21:19.861 --> 21:20.821
-So sorry.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.698
Mr. President, Admiral Schneider.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.659
Admiral, I understand
you may have a solution for us here.

21:25.742 --> 21:28.662
In 2016, we recovered
a Russian-made MiG-29KR

21:28.745 --> 21:29.663
that went down in Syria.

21:29.746 --> 21:31.039
Did some reverse engineering

21:31.123 --> 21:34.042
and learned how we might hack
the automatic pilots of enemy fighters.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.003
On your command, we can initiate the hack,

21:36.086 --> 21:38.463
try to redirect the bomber's course
back over the Pacific.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.925
-[sighs] Will it work?
-We don't know, sir.

21:42.009 --> 21:43.510
It's never been tested in the field.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.013
[Tom] No one else knows
that we have this technology?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.974
I'm assuming that because
it's the first I've ever heard of it.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.018
If we use it now, we give away that game.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.436
What do you think?

21:53.228 --> 21:56.064
The tech is designed to work
in a situation like this.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.774
If it doesn't work, no one's the wiser.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.527
If it works, revealing the secret's
a whole lot better

22:00.610 --> 22:03.405
than having nuclear bombs
setting off on American soil.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.032
I agree. Set it up.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.663
Emily. Hey, do you know
where Aaron is, by any chance?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.248
-He's not in his office.
-[Emily] Uh...

22:13.332 --> 22:16.960
Apparently there's some all-hands-on-deck
in the Situation Room, so...

22:17.544 --> 22:20.172
Hey. This is awkward.

22:20.255 --> 22:25.469
Uh, I heard Aaron confided in you
about Mariluz Santiago. Is that true?

22:25.552 --> 22:28.472
Do you know
why he would tell you and not me?

22:29.639 --> 22:34.519
Um, no, I don't know. You know, we were
working on the campaign together, so...

22:34.603 --> 22:37.230
You should ask him about it.
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.362
Dontae!

22:45.447 --> 22:47.616
[chuckles] Mr. Press Secretary.

22:47.699 --> 22:51.078
Oh, shit, right.
How you doing, man? You okay?

22:51.828 --> 22:54.164
I am. Thanks for asking.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.834
-Let's talk about something else.
-Yeah, sorry.

22:57.918 --> 23:02.798
So, you know how you helped Isabel
with those video testimonials?

23:02.881 --> 23:05.383
Persuade the drug company
to stop being a rapacious asshole?

23:05.467 --> 23:06.843
She told you about that?

23:06.927 --> 23:09.679
I'm wondering if you can help me
with something similar.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.307
Something to persuade Sasha.

23:12.390 --> 23:13.809
Not that she's a rapacious asshole,

23:13.892 --> 23:17.813
but something to persuade her
to, you know, engage.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.441
Like, with what? A transgender supercut?

23:22.192 --> 23:24.402
Well, if you're gonna put it that way...

23:25.028 --> 23:25.862
I got a better idea.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.535
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, sweetheart.

23:34.412 --> 23:35.413
She seems cheery.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.291
Just gave her the pain meds.
She should be good for another four hours.

23:38.375 --> 23:41.628
-I'm guessing she didn't eat?
-No, she said she wasn't hungry.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.421
[sighs] Yeah, she says that a lot.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.424
When patients stop eating,

23:46.508 --> 23:49.219
especially at your mother's stage,
it's usually a signal.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.680
It's to let us know they're ready to go.

23:52.222 --> 23:54.474
All the plans are in place
for her last steps.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.686
Just let me know when you're ready.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.188
See you in the morning.

24:10.448 --> 24:14.369
Mars. Do you know
what is going on around here?

24:14.452 --> 24:17.622
Why has everyone disappeared
in the midst of a campaign crisis?

24:17.706 --> 24:21.001
We're getting killed in the press,
and I can't get the president.

24:21.084 --> 24:25.005
I can't get my VP candidate,
who's supposed to be saving his own bacon

24:25.088 --> 24:29.467
on national TV in a couple of hours.
You've been totally AWOL.

24:30.385 --> 24:32.637
What the fuck is happening
in the Situation Room?

24:32.721 --> 24:35.557
I don't know, Lorraine.
I'll do what I can to find out.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.933
[sighs]

24:37.893 --> 24:39.811
I hate chasing men.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.189
-[door opens]
-Nice of you to join us.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.484
Admiral, where are we at?

24:46.568 --> 24:48.278
We're ready to go on your command.

24:48.361 --> 24:52.282
You're a go. Contact the FAA,
clear the immediate airspace.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.700
If the plane doesn't turn,
we'll take it down

24:53.783 --> 24:56.077
-over the Umatilla National Forest.
-Yes, sir.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.662
If there are nukes onboard?

24:58.371 --> 24:59.998
We pray they don't detonate.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.000
[Schneider] The hack is initiated, sir.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.926
-[computer beeping]
-[Schneider] Malware uploaded.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.310
Come on, you son of a bitch. Turn.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.942
She's turning! [laughing]

25:30.654 --> 25:31.947
Nicely done, Mr. President.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.158
Nicely done, Aaron.
Great job, General. Great job.

25:35.242 --> 25:38.745
Admiral, thank you very, very much.
General, how much fuel is onboard?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.538
[Kellogg] Seven hours worth, give or take.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.750
At this trajectory, she should go down
just north of Midway Island,

25:43.833 --> 25:45.543
far away from any population centers, sir.

25:45.627 --> 25:49.214
Fantastic. Great work, everyone.
Thank you very much.

25:53.969 --> 25:57.180
-Everything peachy in there?
-Peachy keen.

25:57.264 --> 25:59.933
All right. So, do you have a draft
that I can look at?

26:00.016 --> 26:02.936
I'm sure the teleprompter people
would like to see it, too.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.854
-We've been dealing with a crisis all day.
-[Lorraine] Hmm.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.690
We'll have to postpone the remarks.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.900
[stutters] Uh, no. Whoa.

26:09.609 --> 26:12.070
Whoa. The fuck we are.

26:12.153 --> 26:14.698
While you've been
in the Sit Room playing <i>Stratego,</i>

26:14.781 --> 26:17.867
Moss' attack dogs
have been all over the news,

26:17.951 --> 26:20.620
making you out to be coyote-in-chief.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.332
If we don't seize the story back
right now, that's it. You're done.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.043
You heard the lady.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.337
[sighs] Okay.

26:29.921 --> 26:34.259
So, shave that pretty face
and put on your big-girl panties.

26:34.342 --> 26:35.760
It's do-or-die time.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.807
[indistinct chatter]

26:40.890 --> 26:43.768
Thanks for coming.
I know the president appreciates it.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.187
I'm only here because you asked me.

26:46.271 --> 26:50.108
Not for the president, and definitely not
for that little press hound of his.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.319
[chuckles] Seth's a good guy.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.112
Ugh, he's so exhausting.

26:54.195 --> 26:56.489
-Like a Shriner on cocaine.
-[clears throat]

26:57.907 --> 26:58.783
Oops.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.744
No worries. I'd love to be a Shriner.

27:00.827 --> 27:03.121
Their tiny cars are chick magnets.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.247
[Xavier] Let's get started.

27:04.873 --> 27:09.169
I see we have a few new faces tonight.
This is a safe space.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.297
Discussion is welcome, judgment is not.

27:12.380 --> 27:13.465
Who wants to begin?

27:13.548 --> 27:16.134
My first introduction
to transness was those

27:16.217 --> 27:21.139
disgusting female impersonator segments
on <i>Maury Povich.</i>

27:21.222 --> 27:23.725
So, it was, like,
an introduction to the concept,

27:23.808 --> 27:25.727
but not the humanity of it.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.103
So many of us as trans people,

27:27.187 --> 27:30.190
so much of our day is like,
"How do I stay alive today?"

27:30.273 --> 27:31.775
And it's, like, that's dark.

27:31.858 --> 27:32.984
[all laughing]

27:33.068 --> 27:37.364
I've had friends who have been fired,
lost their jobs, are homeless,

27:37.447 --> 27:41.743
because they simply just came to work
and said, "I'm me."

27:41.826 --> 27:43.453
Some days, it's easy to be full of pride,

27:43.536 --> 27:46.039
and some days you have to fill out
something with your birth name

27:46.122 --> 27:47.540
'cause it's not changed yet,
and you see it,

27:47.624 --> 27:50.126
and it destroys everything.
You can't breathe anymore.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.504
Depending on where I go
or what time of the day it is,

27:52.587 --> 27:55.423
using different washrooms
is so nerve-racking now.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.802
'Cause before, if they were gendered,
I would just use the women's washroom.

27:58.885 --> 28:01.846
It's a whole other level of, like, fear.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.932
There's a privilege that I'm getting.

28:04.015 --> 28:09.229
I benefited a lot from
the previous generation in this community.

28:09.312 --> 28:13.441
We all spent so much of our life
pretending to be somebody else.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.403
And that means that, like,
we're hiding from ourselves,

28:16.486 --> 28:17.904
and from the people that love us,

28:17.987 --> 28:23.410
and at the end of the day, like,
when we have to hide who we are,

28:23.493 --> 28:25.995
both us and the people that love us lose.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.792
How about you? Is there anything
you'd like to share with us?

28:31.751 --> 28:34.838
-I'd just like to listen, if that's okay?
-Of course.

28:34.921 --> 28:38.675
Now, I find
that I'm in this really great space

28:38.758 --> 28:41.052
where I'm so proud of my transness

28:41.136 --> 28:44.097
and I'm so proud of my outness
and my visibility.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.599
I am what trans looks like.
Every single one of us is.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.185
And that's why
we should just be proud for ourselves,

28:49.269 --> 28:50.687
so others can see our pride.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.400
[inaudible]

29:14.753 --> 29:15.587
Eat.

29:16.838 --> 29:17.839
[Carrie groans]

29:18.673 --> 29:21.259
I would, I'm just not hungry.

29:21.342 --> 29:26.181
I know and I just don't care.
It's soup. Please eat the soup.

29:28.516 --> 29:30.852
How the tables have turned.
[chuckles]

29:33.480 --> 29:36.566
Mom, I know you might be ready,

29:38.026 --> 29:41.154
but I'm not. Not yet.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.656
That's okay, pop-tart.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.370
I still have a bunch of <i>Grace and Frankies</i>
to watch, anyway. [chuckles]

29:54.042 --> 29:55.293
[knock on door]

29:55.376 --> 29:57.420
Call incoming from the FDA.

30:00.340 --> 30:02.467
Hello. Yes.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.846
I would be interested, yes.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.683
Right now? I'm on my way.

30:11.851 --> 30:15.188
I'm going off campus.
Have them bring the car around.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.483
[door opens]

30:18.566 --> 30:19.776
[Isabel] How's the speech coming?

30:21.236 --> 30:23.321
[Aaron] It's all this fake outrage.

30:23.404 --> 30:27.242
What the real story should be about
is what I did today.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.453
The work no one knows about,
protecting this country.

30:30.537 --> 30:33.248
Okay, forget about what they're expecting,

30:33.331 --> 30:37.126
what Kirkman, or Lorraine
or even I wanna hear.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.920
Say what you need to say.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.088
I don't know what that is.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.508
The thing is, Isi...

30:43.591 --> 30:46.761
The thing that kills me is that I want it.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.974
And not just for me,
but for what it means.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.810
The first Latino vice president.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.564
That means something. But how...

30:58.940 --> 31:00.233
how do I express it?

31:02.610 --> 31:03.778
Speak your truth.

31:04.696 --> 31:05.864
Be honest.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.244
And I'll be right there, okay?

31:11.327 --> 31:14.747
No matter how it goes,
I'll be right there for you.

31:16.499 --> 31:20.128
And we'll go home, and life will go on.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.673
[speaking Spanish]

31:26.009 --> 31:27.343
[speaking Spanish]

31:38.563 --> 31:39.522
[speaking Spanish]

31:44.903 --> 31:45.904
[exhales heavily]

31:50.366 --> 31:55.872
Good evening, and thank you for giving me
the opportunity to explain myself.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.045
To explain myself.

32:03.546 --> 32:06.799
I came here, tonight, to apologize.

32:08.134 --> 32:10.762
But what I need to do
is take responsibility.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.514
When I was 16 years of age,

32:14.432 --> 32:17.977
I took an undocumented six-year-old child
across the border.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.023
Her parents had been killed,
and she had no place to go,

32:23.107 --> 32:24.567
but that's no excuse.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.236
What I did was against the law,

32:28.154 --> 32:30.281
and I have to take responsibility
for that.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.662
I have to own what I've done and who I am.

32:36.287 --> 32:41.334
<i>But first, let's take a look</i>
<i>at what Mariluz Santiago has done.</i>

32:41.417 --> 32:43.795
<i>Even though she could</i>
<i>never become a citizen,</i>

32:43.878 --> 32:46.005
<i>because of the way</i>
<i>she entered our country,</i>

32:46.756 --> 32:48.800
<i>she graduated from college with honors.</i>

32:48.883 --> 32:52.720
<i>She served in the US Army,</i>
<i>was deployed in Afghanistan.</i>

32:52.804 --> 32:56.015
<i>Now, she serves her community</i>
<i>as a teacher.</i>

32:56.724 --> 32:59.936
<i>She's become a part</i>
<i>of what makes this country great.</i>

33:00.853 --> 33:02.939
And isn't that the story of immigration?

33:07.151 --> 33:09.237
It's the story of my family, too.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.698
I'm Texan on my mother's side.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.492
My father was an immigrant
to this country.

33:14.575 --> 33:17.120
He came here legally.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.956
Still, he was constantly threatened
with deportation

33:20.039 --> 33:21.457
by his employers in the oil fields.

33:22.041 --> 33:26.921
He was called a wetback,
a spic, a brown boy.

33:29.215 --> 33:32.010
But his name was Arturo Rivera.

33:40.893 --> 33:43.062
You see, I wanted more than all of that.

33:44.063 --> 33:46.190
So I did my best to assimilate.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.900
I changed my name,

33:49.027 --> 33:52.655
leaving behind Aaron Rivera,
my father's name,

33:53.489 --> 33:54.991
for Aaron Shore.

33:55.074 --> 34:00.371
<i>But today, I can no longer sit idly by</i>
<i>while people like Cornelius Moss</i>

34:00.455 --> 34:04.208
<i>use individuals like Mariluz Santiago</i>
<i>and my father as boogeymen</i>

34:04.292 --> 34:05.668
<i>to turn us against one another.</i>

34:05.752 --> 34:10.048
It shouldn't be a crime for a mother
to seek a better life for her child.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.717
<i>Their existence is not a crime.</i>

34:13.384 --> 34:18.556
<i>They come here to do the unseen work,</i>
<i>the hard work they've always done,</i>

34:19.182 --> 34:24.020
not looking for credit,
only looking to contribute.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.900
Earlier today, I offered
to resign from the ticket.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.861
<i>But rather than accepting my resignation,</i>

34:31.944 --> 34:33.780
<i>President Kirkman asked me</i>
<i>to speak to you.</i>

34:34.947 --> 34:37.658
And I believe I speak for the both of us
when I say,

34:37.742 --> 34:43.164
the leadership that this country needs is
one that respects differences,

34:43.247 --> 34:45.083
not one that demonizes them.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.961
That's why I'm proud
to be Tom Kirkman's running mate.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.923
That's why I'm a proud Mexican-American...

34:53.466 --> 34:57.303
a proud Latino and a proud Rivera.

34:59.138 --> 35:02.225
It's become cliché
to end political speeches

35:02.308 --> 35:04.060
by saying, "God bless America."

35:05.895 --> 35:07.396
But it's not a cliché to me.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.275
To me, it is a prayer.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.362
So, may God bless America.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.490
[speaking Spanish]

35:18.116 --> 35:19.575
Thank you for listening.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.830
[indistinct chatter]

35:24.372 --> 35:25.414
[Aaron sighs]

35:34.132 --> 35:35.007
[exhales heavily]

35:35.091 --> 35:38.719
-Can we get out of here? Need a drink.
-Of course.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.514
He knocked it out of the park,
you gotta admit.

35:41.597 --> 35:42.473
Yes, he did.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.227
-Time to pick.
-How'd she do on those?

35:46.310 --> 35:47.311
Oh, she did great.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.150
About the resignation letter, I was angry.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.818
You had every right to be.

35:55.903 --> 35:57.655
You know which one to rip up.

36:01.909 --> 36:04.078
No, not that one, the other one.

36:04.162 --> 36:04.996
[gasps]

36:05.997 --> 36:09.876
Oh, wow. You really ought to
take that show on the road.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.085
[knock on door]

36:11.169 --> 36:12.003
[Tom] General.

36:14.046 --> 36:16.632
[Kellogg] Mr. President,
I have an update for you, sir.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.467
It's all right, General. Proceed.

36:18.551 --> 36:23.472
Just got word. The Russians shot down
their Tu-95 over the open Pacific.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.390
Why would they do that?

36:24.974 --> 36:27.560
Well, I can only speculate,
but I would imagine

36:27.643 --> 36:32.023
they wanted to ensure we couldn't recover
the Kh-55 and their warheads.

36:32.106 --> 36:34.358
Especially if they figured out
we hacked their systems

36:34.442 --> 36:37.111
using the avionics from the downed MiG.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.323
-Okay, General, thank you very much.
-Thank you, sir.

36:46.245 --> 36:49.665
Okay, I'm just connecting the dots here,

36:49.749 --> 36:52.835
but did you just quarterback us
out of a nuclear crisis?

36:54.378 --> 36:56.964
-Okay, I gotta get that story out there.
-No.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.008
-We're not advertising this.
-Why not?

36:59.091 --> 37:02.220
The technology we used
to turn the plane around is classified.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.096
We advertise the incident,
we advertise that, too.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.808
So what? The general just implied
the Russians already know.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.394
It's in the Russians' interest
to keep it quiet.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.104
We've got other enemies out there.

37:12.188 --> 37:17.401
We've got other enemies right here, Tom.
Look, a story has fallen into our laps.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.780
A story about the most difficult day
of your presidency.

37:20.863 --> 37:21.906
Why not use that?

37:21.989 --> 37:23.950
And there it is. "Use it."

37:24.492 --> 37:27.620
"Use this. Use that."
Everything's transactional with you,

37:27.703 --> 37:30.665
wrapped up in tiny little units
of political utility.

37:30.748 --> 37:33.334
That is politics!

37:34.335 --> 37:37.713
I was beginning to think
that you were beginning to get it.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.884
You know, it occurs to me that you
may not have what it takes to win.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.596
Because what it takes,
more often than not, is ruthlessness.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.099
And you know who has that? Moss has that.

37:48.683 --> 37:52.687
Moss has it pumping
through his cold, dark heart.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.397
I wish I could give you a transfusion.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.983
Maybe you'd be ready for the knife fight
that you're in--

37:57.066 --> 37:59.318
Okay! Enough!

38:00.569 --> 38:02.238
That'll be all, Lorraine.

38:03.781 --> 38:04.865
Thank you.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.095
I've kept this job for 35 years.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.015
I've given more time to it
than I gave to my children.

38:30.099 --> 38:33.269
"Knowing thyself is the beginning
of all wisdom."

38:34.645 --> 38:37.565
Up to now,
my civil service has meant silence.

38:38.274 --> 38:42.236
During the Moss administration,
during Richmond's, even this one.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.613
But I do listen.

38:46.741 --> 38:50.786
FlagKind's opioid was up for approval
during Moss' presidency.

38:51.620 --> 38:55.082
Mr. Detwiler was commissioner,
and Mr. Richter, at the time,

38:55.166 --> 38:58.711
was our head of the Center
for Drug Evaluation and Research.

38:59.837 --> 39:04.342
Internal studies suggested
the drug had a high potential for abuse.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.594
Do you have proof?

39:14.769 --> 39:15.728
It's all there.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.857
Mr. Detwiler guaranteed
Mr. Richter a promotion

39:19.940 --> 39:23.652
if he turned a blind eye
and rubberstamped the approval.

39:23.736 --> 39:28.657
A couple years later, Mr. Detwiler left
to join the board of FlagKind.

39:28.741 --> 39:31.744
Mr. Richter became the commissioner.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.915
This is collusion, plain and simple.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.544
Why share this now?

39:42.171 --> 39:45.508
I grew up in Williamson, West Virginia.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.552
It's slow, and it's quiet,

39:49.303 --> 39:52.640
and when people feel pain,
or they feel a dullness,

39:53.474 --> 39:55.935
they turn to prescription painkillers.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.063
-You've heard of pill mills?
-Yeah.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.148
Over the last decade,

40:01.232 --> 40:06.153
more than 20 million pills
for a town of less than 3,000.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.698
What doctor in his right mind...

40:12.243 --> 40:14.954
Too many people I know have died.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.712
Take this and do something about it.

It wasn't a speech.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.467
It was a pony show.

Well, I do, okay? And I saw it tonight.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.815
Look, all these people,
Lorraine, the media,

41:24.899 --> 41:28.152
they look at you and they just see
how they can use you.

41:28.235 --> 41:29.778
But I see you.

41:30.613 --> 41:32.823
I see a piece of myself in you.

41:33.741 --> 41:35.701
I'm so fucking proud of you.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.331
-I love you so much.
-Jesus. I'm such a fucking asshole.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.666
You're putting
too much pressure on yourself.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.001
I slept with Emily.

41:49.798 --> 41:52.510
It was a mistake,
and I hate myself for doing it.

41:53.219 --> 41:55.179
Believe me, I hate myself.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.933
But I have to take responsibility
for this, as well.

42:00.601 --> 42:04.313

so I'm gonna be honest.

42:35.469 --> 42:37.346
Is Moss still nickel-and-diming you?

42:37.429 --> 42:40.099
Mmm, it's more nickels
than dimes these days.

Hmm. So I assume you're still open

I can make anything easy.

would I be happy with the person
