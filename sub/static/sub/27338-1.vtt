- Come on Sarah, eat!

00:28.344 --> 00:30.458
- Yeah, now they think that
it might be a nut allergy,

00:30.482 --> 00:32.034
of all things,

00:32.067 --> 00:33.068
it's crazy.

00:34.413 --> 00:37.344
Hailey, would you get your
brother for school please?

00:38.724 --> 00:41.620
Yeah, no, I can come
pick you guys up.

00:41.655 --> 00:43.724
- Cameron
get down here now!

00:43.758 --> 00:45.665
- I just need to drop some
paperwork off at the school.

00:45.689 --> 00:47.689
Please don't yell in the house.

00:49.172 --> 00:51.655
- Mom, I don't
wanna go to school.

00:51.689 --> 00:53.000
- You need to go to school.

00:54.172 --> 00:56.206
And you need to
eat your breakfast.

00:56.241 --> 00:58.034
- I'm not hungry.

00:58.068 --> 01:00.620
- We go through this
same thing every morning.

01:01.827 --> 01:03.310
- Why do you have
that stupid stuffed

01:03.344 --> 01:04.447
animal on the table?

01:06.034 --> 01:07.172
- Shut up!

01:07.206 --> 01:08.206
- Whatever.

01:09.551 --> 01:10.931
- Tell me about it.

01:12.137 --> 01:14.103
Now there's somebody
at the door.

01:14.137 --> 01:15.551
It's been a crazy morning.

01:17.034 --> 01:19.275
God knows who's here so
early in the morning.

01:21.965 --> 01:24.206
Great, nobody's here!

01:26.206 --> 01:27.793
- Mommy, mommy, mommy!

01:30.862 --> 01:31.862
- Hailey?

01:35.034 --> 01:36.034
Cameron?

01:36.758 --> 01:37.758
Hailey!

01:39.137 --> 01:40.137
Hailey!

01:42.655 --> 01:43.655
Cameron!

01:47.862 --> 01:49.827
- Susan,
is everything okay?

01:51.103 --> 01:55.517
- Hailey, where are you!

05:36.275 --> 05:37.793
- Thank you so much.

05:37.827 --> 05:40.241
Y'all ready for
the big festival?

05:43.034 --> 05:45.344
Y'all got your wheelbarrows
ready for the race?

05:46.586 --> 05:49.379
This year's first place
prize, gonna be $2,000.

05:52.379 --> 05:54.344
So who's gonna
win that big race?

06:24.172 --> 06:25.068
- I don't know why you haven't

06:25.103 --> 06:26.620
broken up with that penis yet.

06:26.655 --> 06:28.137
He treats you like shit, girl!

06:31.689 --> 06:35.310
Bye, I'm gonna go to
the little girl's room.

06:42.241 --> 06:43.424
Girl, where did you
get that necklace?

06:43.448 --> 06:45.241
It is fabulous.

06:45.275 --> 06:47.000
- I don't know, my
grandma gave it to me.

06:47.034 --> 06:47.931
Ouch!

06:47.965 --> 06:49.413
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

06:49.448 --> 06:51.655
My nail must have got
caught in your hair, bye.

07:00.896 --> 07:02.689
- You have to go there.

07:02.724 --> 07:03.827
It's quite the place.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.000
So, aliens and hybrinoids
are basically the same thing.

07:09.034 --> 07:10.827
Except in the game
version the hybrinoids

07:10.862 --> 07:12.448
have super human power.

07:13.931 --> 07:15.320
I mean, you really
have to understand

07:15.344 --> 07:16.976
quantum physics to
realize how the molecular

07:17.000 --> 07:18.827
field is changed in space,

07:18.862 --> 07:20.241
allowing for this to happen.

07:20.275 --> 07:22.310
- Wait, I thought
hybrinoids and aliens

07:22.344 --> 07:23.551
were the same thing?

07:24.655 --> 07:26.965
- What, no, no, no, no.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.413
You obviously
haven't been playing

07:29.448 --> 07:31.137
this game for very long.

07:31.172 --> 07:34.655
I've already invested
82 hours and 17 minutes.

07:34.689 --> 07:37.482
I'd say that makes me
the table expert here.

07:37.517 --> 07:39.344
Unless one of you
subterranean Zandoids

07:39.379 --> 07:41.689
wants to challenge, the Master?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.000
- So if hybrinoids
and aliens aren't

07:45.034 --> 07:46.724
the same thing
does that mean they

07:46.758 --> 07:48.448
can't live on Zandar?

08:00.758 --> 08:01.620
- I can't believe
you make me come

08:01.655 --> 08:03.344
to this shit hole every week.

08:03.379 --> 08:05.379
How do people
listen to this crap?

08:05.413 --> 08:07.448
This is a bunch of
whiners if you ask me.

08:09.275 --> 08:10.689
- Move.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.000
- And of all the nights I forgot
my damn iPod at the house.

08:14.034 --> 08:15.286
- Yeah, well what
else are we gonna

08:15.310 --> 08:16.655
do in this hick town?

08:16.689 --> 08:18.320
Seriously, where else
are we gonna play pool?

08:18.344 --> 08:21.034
- Well, how do people listen
to this backwoods shit?

08:24.758 --> 08:26.482
- It's not like
we live in Vegas.

08:27.724 --> 08:29.724
Okay, sweet, rack 'em up Cowboy.

08:30.896 --> 08:34.068
Hey, you wanna go like,
smoke or something?

08:34.102 --> 08:35.309
- Yeah dude, let's do it.

08:37.482 --> 08:38.688
- I'm sick of this shit.

08:38.724 --> 08:40.448
- I'm sick of this shit.

08:40.482 --> 08:42.620
- Seriously, screw this
country music bullshit.

08:42.655 --> 08:43.655
- Yeah, screw it.

08:45.068 --> 08:46.827
- Everyone here
just fucking sucks.

08:46.862 --> 08:49.034
- You just fucking suck.

08:49.068 --> 08:50.758
- You suck too.

08:50.793 --> 08:52.034
- I believe so.

09:13.551 --> 09:15.103
- Like, seriously dude.

09:15.137 --> 09:16.655
She's a bitch.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.344
- Yeah, she's gnarly.

09:18.379 --> 09:22.310
- Sarah, your father
wants you home now.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.758
You give me hit of that, yes?

09:26.896 --> 09:27.862
Okay, you go.

09:27.896 --> 09:30.620
Get out of here,
get out of here.

10:08.137 --> 10:10.793
- Wait, stop, we can't, Heather.

10:11.689 --> 10:13.482
- Audrey, baby, Heather and I

10:13.517 --> 10:15.137
are just together for show.

10:15.172 --> 10:17.000
Cheer captain and quarterback.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.344
And besides, it doesn't matter.

10:20.379 --> 10:22.379
We've practically broken
up at this point anyway.

10:24.310 --> 10:27.103
- God Tanner, I've had a
crush on you for so long.

10:27.137 --> 10:29.689
I've been to every single game.

10:29.724 --> 10:32.793
- Yeah, so you know

10:49.551 --> 10:51.172
I mean, Heather is inside.

10:51.206 --> 10:53.896

you about Heather and I?

We're the ones with
something real between us.

10:59.137 --> 11:01.827

12:19.482 --> 12:21.275

choose a Goth over you?

12:21.310 --> 12:23.241
- Yeah, pretty much
anything that would put out.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.137
- Babe, come on.

12:24.172 --> 12:25.965
I choose you.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.310

- Exactly.

12:30.586 --> 12:31.827

zombie chick when I've got you?

Are you okay?

13:34.068 --> 13:35.724
- Hi Mr. Henderson.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.068
- Are you coming
from teen night?

13:39.103 --> 13:41.000
That's quite a walk.

13:41.034 --> 13:42.724
- Yeah, I needed the fresh air.

13:43.862 --> 13:46.965
- Well, can I at
least offer you a ride

13:47.000 --> 13:49.103
since I almost killed you?

13:49.137 --> 13:51.862
- No, but honestly, I
really need the walk.

13:53.206 --> 13:56.517
- Okay then, see you
at school tomorrow.

13:56.551 --> 13:58.068

Rex, don't do that to me.

14:49.310 --> 14:50.424
Holy shit, what are you doing?

14:50.448 --> 14:52.000
Go home, go home.

15:07.241 --> 15:11.413
- Audrey, what are you
doing out here so late?

15:11.448 --> 15:13.068
- Hi Officer Powell.

15:13.103 --> 15:14.413
- It's way past curfew.

15:14.448 --> 15:16.724
What are you doing
out here all alone?

15:16.758 --> 15:19.931
- I got ditched at the
Pioneer and had to walk.

15:19.965 --> 15:22.103
- I'm sorry, are you all right?

15:22.137 --> 15:23.827
- Yeah, just a bad night.

15:23.862 --> 15:25.655
A stupid guy.

15:25.689 --> 15:27.310
- Well, we're not all that bad.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
He's the one that lost out.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.965
- Well, thanks for stopping.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.172
This is me.

15:34.206 --> 15:35.655
- You get some rest.

15:35.689 --> 15:37.862
We'll see you at the festival.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.172
- Rex.

16:14.517 --> 16:18.689
Holy shit, you scared
the shit out of me!

16:18.724 --> 16:20.896
What are you doing here?

17:01.482 --> 17:02.689
- Nice of you to show up.

17:04.827 --> 17:06.205
So where's your slut friend?

17:07.275 --> 17:08.550
- My slut friend.

17:09.586 --> 17:10.586
Right.

17:11.586 --> 17:12.838
Your dick of a
boyfriend has been

17:12.862 --> 17:15.413
trying to nail Audrey
for weeks, you know.

17:15.448 --> 17:16.596
You're just too
caught up in your dumb

17:16.619 --> 17:18.310
bimbo squad to notice
what's going on.

17:19.448 --> 17:20.655
So shut your fucking mouth

17:20.689 --> 17:22.827
before I strangle your
scrawny little neck.

17:26.068 --> 17:27.655
- Yeah, just like a Goth.

17:28.827 --> 17:30.107
Well, tell your
whore of a friend

17:30.137 --> 17:32.793
I'll be looking for her
in the hallways later.

17:32.827 --> 17:35.793
- Why don't you tell your
dick stick to find her?

17:35.827 --> 17:36.724
He was the one that
sent her running

17:36.758 --> 17:37.958
off into the woods last night.

17:38.517 --> 17:39.551
- The woods?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.393
- He better hope
nothing happened to her.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.758
- Ohhh, Little Goth Riding
Hood alone in the woods.

17:55.310 --> 17:56.310
- What?

17:57.586 --> 17:58.448
- Your little slut didn't
make it back home last night.

17:58.482 --> 17:59.724
And you're late.

17:59.758 --> 18:01.068
Did you spend the
night with her?

18:01.103 --> 18:02.355
- What the hell are you
talking about Heather?

18:02.379 --> 18:03.596
I was on the phone with
you until I passed out.

18:03.620 --> 18:06.793
- In an open air
Jeep no less, classy.

18:06.827 --> 18:08.896
- Nothing happened.

18:08.931 --> 18:10.275
- Right.

18:10.310 --> 18:11.310
- So where is she?

18:12.724 --> 18:14.689
- Oh, so you do care about her?

18:14.724 --> 18:15.931
- No, I just happen to have--

18:15.965 --> 18:17.482
- You're
a douchebag Tanner.

18:17.517 --> 18:19.320
- Why do you have to be such
an attention whore, Tristan?

18:19.344 --> 18:20.758
- If you guys focused on school,

18:20.793 --> 18:22.079
as much as you guys
focused on gossiping

18:22.103 --> 18:23.310
you'd actually be smart.

18:23.344 --> 18:24.344
- Calm down.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.000
- Hey, hey, hey!

18:28.413 --> 18:30.827
Everyone settle down.

18:30.862 --> 18:32.137
Thank you,

18:32.172 --> 18:34.758
please explain
what's going on here.

18:34.793 --> 18:35.758
- Okay, well these
two bitches here.

18:35.793 --> 18:36.586
- Oh these two bitches?

18:36.620 --> 18:37.586
- I am not a bitch.

18:37.620 --> 18:38.793
You're the bitch.

18:38.827 --> 18:42.310
- Stop, well, since
you've all shown

18:42.344 --> 18:44.862
just how well you
get along together,

18:44.896 --> 18:47.068
you, you, you,

18:47.103 --> 18:49.758
you, you, and you have just been

18:49.793 --> 18:52.482
put together on a festival team.

18:52.517 --> 18:53.931
- Seriously?

18:53.965 --> 18:56.448
- We're already on teams.

18:56.482 --> 18:59.517
- Now you're on different teams.

18:59.551 --> 19:01.000
You will be getting together.

19:02.413 --> 19:04.965
Everyone, pull your
books out to chapter six.

19:08.931 --> 19:11.517
- Yeah, so now I
can't be on the team.

19:13.034 --> 19:15.793
- But you were in
charge this whole time.

19:15.827 --> 19:18.827
- It is just like you
to always desert on us.

19:18.862 --> 19:20.182
- Well you can
thank Gothitude here

19:20.206 --> 19:21.413
and her hussy friend.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.172
- You're such a, whatever.

19:26.448 --> 19:27.827
- Just like Heather.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.310
- Super.

19:37.103 --> 19:38.206
- Fricking sucks man.

19:38.241 --> 19:39.620
- Fuck dude.

19:39.655 --> 19:41.137
- You're always
just chasing tail.

19:41.172 --> 19:42.655
Look where it got you.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.113
Damn, we had a real
chance of winning this.

19:44.137 --> 19:46.068
- I know, I'm sorry.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.103
- Bro, you have all your
priorities out of whack.

19:48.137 --> 19:50.551
You have the hottest
chick in school.

19:50.586 --> 19:51.941
And one of these days
you're just gonna

19:51.965 --> 19:53.172
fuck up and lose her.

19:53.206 --> 19:54.827
- Oh please, you all
know what a piece

19:54.862 --> 19:56.482
of ass Audrey Lowery is?

19:56.517 --> 19:58.620
- Yeah, well that piece of ass

19:58.655 --> 20:00.620
just cost you the competition.

20:00.655 --> 20:02.310
- No worries, we got this.

20:17.413 --> 20:19.965
- So when are the freaks and
geeks supposed to get here?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.793
- I think I just
heard them pull up.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.724
- Hey, we can still
win this thing.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.413
We just have to
work a lot harder.

20:27.655 --> 20:29.137
- Hello?

20:29.172 --> 20:32.000
- At least they figured out
how to use the back door.

20:32.034 --> 20:33.034
- Hey Heather.

20:38.068 --> 20:39.586
- Seriously?

20:39.620 --> 20:41.631
You got more on the floor
than you did in your mouth.

20:41.655 --> 20:42.827
Stop eating like a pig.

20:46.310 --> 20:47.620
30 second rule!

20:49.862 --> 20:51.310
- What do you call yourselves?

20:52.965 --> 20:55.034
Your name, do you have one?

20:58.034 --> 20:59.034
- You're kidding, right?

21:00.275 --> 21:02.034
We have, like, four
classes together.

21:03.655 --> 21:06.000
Jack, my name's Jack.

21:07.379 --> 21:08.862
- And you are?

21:08.896 --> 21:12.241
- I'm Brianna, we have Mr.
Henderson's class together.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.551
I'm friends with Jack.

21:17.172 --> 21:18.172
- Yeah.

21:20.137 --> 21:21.862
- Hi Tanner, I'm Brianna.

21:23.275 --> 21:24.275
- Hello.

21:27.103 --> 21:28.206
- It's open.

21:29.689 --> 21:33.172
- Rear entry, just what I'd
expect from a rich bitch.

21:33.206 --> 21:35.172
Oh and look, designer fag.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.344
- Oh, this coming
from death warmed over.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.206
- Fits her.

21:38.241 --> 21:39.068
Her life sucks.

21:39.103 --> 21:41.241
Her friend's life sucks.

21:41.275 --> 21:43.793
So why not make everyone
else around her miserable?

21:45.758 --> 21:47.862
- I see you took
dickless back, good call.

21:49.034 --> 21:50.620
- So, did
you hear from Audrey?

21:50.655 --> 21:52.689
- You mean your
brainless forest hussy?

21:52.724 --> 21:55.206
- I thought fags were
supposed to be sensitive?

21:55.241 --> 21:57.000
No, no one has heard from her.

21:57.034 --> 21:58.482
- Seriously?

21:58.517 --> 21:59.965
Where do you think she is?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
- Do you even care how
you're making me look, here?

22:03.344 --> 22:04.413
- A real Mother Teresa.

22:05.413 --> 22:06.379
- And the new girl scores!

22:06.413 --> 22:07.344
- Trist!

22:07.379 --> 22:08.620
- What honey?

22:08.655 --> 22:10.862
I didn't know the shy
girl had it in her.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.379
I call it like I see it.

22:12.413 --> 22:15.137
- I mean, maybe something
serious did happen.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.137
- Seriously, she's
probably off screwing

22:17.172 --> 22:18.724
someone else's boyfriend.

22:18.758 --> 22:20.413
Who cares what happened to her.

22:20.448 --> 22:21.620
- Fuck you.

22:21.655 --> 22:22.975
- No, you shut
your fucking mouth.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.551
- Is this how we're
supposed to win a race?

22:28.586 --> 22:30.000
What was Mr. Henderson thinking,

22:30.034 --> 22:31.344
putting us together?

22:31.379 --> 22:32.448
- Fuck Henderson.

22:34.551 --> 22:37.137
- Okay, I think we all
just need to settle down

22:37.172 --> 22:39.241
and maybe crack open
a bottle of bubbly

22:39.275 --> 22:41.551
to celebrate us coming together.

22:42.793 --> 22:44.827
- You don't drink, do you?

22:44.862 --> 22:46.482
- Look, we have to figure out

22:46.517 --> 22:48.137
what we're doing
for the festival

22:48.172 --> 22:50.275
so we're just gonna
have to get along,

22:50.310 --> 22:52.896
like it or not.

22:52.931 --> 22:55.000
- Not, but if I have to
work with you losers,

22:55.034 --> 22:57.275
then I might as well be
completely shit faced.

22:58.482 --> 22:59.758
Anybody got a chaser?

22:59.793 --> 23:01.010
- We didn't really
know Audrey that well

23:01.034 --> 23:02.379
but we had a class together.

23:02.413 --> 23:03.758
She seems really nice.

23:04.724 --> 23:05.896
Did you call her parents?

23:05.931 --> 23:07.862
- Her fucking parents
don't give a shit.

23:07.896 --> 23:10.344
Seriously, they're out of
town all the time on vacation.

23:10.379 --> 23:12.241
Like, she's been alone
since she was 14.

23:12.275 --> 23:13.379
- Here.

23:13.413 --> 23:14.344
- No thank you.

23:14.379 --> 23:15.586
- Go ahead, give it a try.

23:15.620 --> 23:16.940
Just a little sip,
little sip sip.

23:19.724 --> 23:21.413
- Drink up, it's there.

23:21.448 --> 23:22.758
- Do you even drink?

23:22.793 --> 23:24.896
- I'm sure she
just went to Denver

23:24.931 --> 23:26.103
to blow off some steam.

23:26.137 --> 23:27.896
I mean, let's be
honest, who doesn't

23:27.931 --> 23:30.172
get claustrophobic
in this small town?

23:30.206 --> 23:31.344
- Yeah, maybe.

23:31.379 --> 23:33.896
I mean, she has a
cousin who lives there.

23:33.931 --> 23:35.172
- There you go.

23:35.206 --> 23:37.689
- So, how long have
you guys been together?

23:37.724 --> 23:41.586
- Oh, no, no,
we're not together.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.758
- Really?

23:42.793 --> 23:44.586
But you guys would be so cute.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.448
- Okay, okay, can we cut
the shit and get focused?

23:47.482 --> 23:48.769
With enough of
these, maybe we can

23:48.793 --> 23:50.448
actually find a way
to work together

23:50.482 --> 23:52.034
and try to win this thing,

23:52.068 --> 23:53.068
who's with me?

23:54.034 --> 23:55.034
- I'm in.

23:56.103 --> 23:58.172
- Okay then, we
need to pick a theme

23:58.206 --> 23:59.862
and we need to
practice the race.

24:00.793 --> 24:02.586
It's my last year.

24:02.620 --> 24:05.655
I want that trophy
and I want that cash.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.034
All right, now that
we're on the same page

24:10.068 --> 24:11.068
let's pick a theme.

24:12.172 --> 24:15.310
- I say we go with
sexy vampires.

24:15.344 --> 24:17.517
- Yeah, because
that's not overdone.

24:17.551 --> 24:19.827
- Okay, werewolves.

24:19.862 --> 24:21.655
But they have to
be sexy werewolves.

24:21.689 --> 24:23.206
- Isn't that the same thing?

24:23.241 --> 24:24.724
- Anyone have any other ideas?

24:26.827 --> 24:28.000
- Warlocks.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.275
Warlocks are always good.

24:30.275 --> 24:31.517
- Those aren't sexy.

24:33.034 --> 24:35.275
- Okay, well how about we
just go with hockey masks?

24:35.310 --> 24:37.862
Simple and we don't
have to wear makeup.

24:37.896 --> 24:41.241
- What, no makeup?

24:41.275 --> 24:43.586
Nah, that's not gonna
work for me honey, sorry.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.103
- No, I think it's a great idea.

24:45.137 --> 24:47.206
I mean, it's easy and
we don't have time

24:47.241 --> 24:48.689
to get costumes anyway.

24:48.724 --> 24:50.241
- You'd look good in a mask.

24:50.275 --> 24:52.206
- Oh, like the
transparent one you wear?

24:56.931 --> 24:58.700
- Look, we don't have
time for this shit, okay.

24:58.724 --> 25:00.689
Hockey masks it is.

25:00.724 --> 25:02.586
So, who's gonna be
in the wheelbarrow?

25:04.793 --> 25:05.941
- I've always
wanted to be pulled

25:05.965 --> 25:07.000
around in a chariot.

25:08.551 --> 25:10.931
- Okay, so we're
making great headway.

25:10.965 --> 25:12.551
What about a wheelbarrow?

25:12.586 --> 25:15.206
- Well the rules say
we have to build one.

25:15.241 --> 25:16.448
- Way ahead of you.

25:16.482 --> 25:17.700
I had one built from
my previous team.

25:17.724 --> 25:19.137
They brought it
over this morning.

25:29.620 --> 25:30.827
- Black?

25:30.862 --> 25:31.655
- It's--

25:31.689 --> 25:33.517
- Super creepy!

25:33.551 --> 25:35.241
- Super crappy!

25:35.275 --> 25:37.379
- It's not crappy, it's light.

25:37.413 --> 25:39.862
The lighter it is, the
faster we can push it.

25:39.896 --> 25:41.965
- Are you sure it can
carry four people in it?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
It looks too flimsy to me.

25:44.034 --> 25:46.206
- It looks like it wouldn't
even hold horse manure.

25:48.586 --> 25:49.379
What?

25:49.413 --> 25:50.689
It doesn't.

25:50.724 --> 25:52.793
- What do you want
it to look like?

25:52.827 --> 25:54.655
- Like a wheelbarrow?

25:54.689 --> 25:57.827
- Oh, there's a wheelbarrow
outside grandpa's shed.

25:57.862 --> 26:00.275
- Well maybe we
should go take it.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.275
- Seriously?

26:01.310 --> 26:02.689
- Shit, why not?

26:02.724 --> 26:04.172
Apparently this
ain't up to snuff.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.517
Maybe we should go steal it.

26:06.551 --> 26:08.275
- Wait, why the hell
is there a wheelbarrow

26:08.310 --> 26:09.758
outside that creepy shed?

26:09.793 --> 26:11.344
- Oh, The Body Keepers.

26:11.379 --> 26:13.551
They use it to bring
in dry ice for grandpa.

26:13.586 --> 26:14.862
- Body keepers?

26:16.068 --> 26:17.079
- Yeah, since
1993, these people,

26:17.103 --> 26:19.586
the keeper's of the bodies,

26:19.620 --> 26:21.320
have been changing the
dry ice around his coffin

26:21.344 --> 26:22.344
to keep him frozen.

26:23.517 --> 26:26.310
You know, there used to
be two bodies in there.

26:26.344 --> 26:28.689
But no one knows what
happened to the second one.

26:28.724 --> 26:31.482
Legend has it that
this guy, grandpa,

26:31.517 --> 26:33.586
was frozen in Norway.

26:33.620 --> 26:34.769
And not just because he wanted

26:34.793 --> 26:36.586
to be brought back
to life later.

26:36.620 --> 26:37.872
Apparently he was some professor

26:37.896 --> 26:41.000
who was trying to
re-innervate people.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.655
But when he didn't succeed,

26:43.758 --> 26:45.448
he started to harvest
souls instead.

26:47.310 --> 26:49.965
This guy, he became
a serial killer.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.068
He collected
bodies, kids mostly.

26:53.103 --> 26:56.655
He figured out a way to
extract souls from his victims.

26:56.689 --> 26:59.689
The bodies were kept on
ice so they wouldn't decay.

26:59.724 --> 27:02.275
That way you can move
their souls back and forth,

27:02.310 --> 27:04.206
any time he wanted to.

27:04.241 --> 27:06.793
These people were left
in a state of purgatory

27:06.827 --> 27:08.137
because this professor guy,

27:08.172 --> 27:10.275
he created a living
hell on earth for them.

27:13.517 --> 27:15.241
- What, that's bullshit!

27:15.275 --> 27:17.206
Where did you read this crap?

27:17.241 --> 27:19.862
I mean, how could
somebody move souls?

27:19.896 --> 27:22.034
- I'm just telling
you what I read.

27:22.068 --> 27:23.137
- Okay, go on Jack.

27:24.758 --> 27:29.517
- So, to stop this guy, they
cryogenically froze him alive,

27:29.551 --> 27:31.482
so that they could
freeze his soul,

27:31.517 --> 27:32.931
encasing him forever.

27:39.551 --> 27:41.448
- You guys actually
believe that shit?

27:41.482 --> 27:42.769
Come on, everybody
knows it's just

27:42.793 --> 27:43.976
some old dead guy
who wants to be

27:44.000 --> 27:45.655
brought back to life someday.

27:45.689 --> 27:47.517
- I think Jack's
on to something.

27:47.551 --> 27:49.034
I say we go.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.034
Who wants to go take a
look at the dead guy?

27:51.068 --> 27:52.172
Steal a wheelbarrow?

27:53.275 --> 27:54.275
- I'm in.

27:57.103 --> 27:58.551
- Yeah, me too.

27:58.586 --> 27:59.965
- This is stupid.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.068
- This is a bad idea guys.

28:01.103 --> 28:02.206
We can't do this.

28:02.241 --> 28:03.413
- Shut the fuck up.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.000
- You shut the fuck
up Tanner, okay?

28:05.034 --> 28:06.379
This is sacrilegious.

28:06.413 --> 28:08.206
This kind of shit
gets people killed.

28:10.068 --> 28:12.206
- Okay then, it's settled.

28:12.241 --> 28:13.482
- Now?

28:13.517 --> 28:14.596
- Well we can't very
well break into a shed

28:14.620 --> 28:15.862
during the day, can we?

28:16.793 --> 28:18.344
- Well I can't wear this.

28:18.379 --> 28:19.448
Come on.

28:19.482 --> 28:20.758
- Fuck!

28:40.862 --> 28:42.517
- Ahh, this is sick.

28:46.482 --> 28:49.344
- Don't they have, like, some
sort of security for this?

28:51.413 --> 28:52.551
- I don't know.

28:52.586 --> 28:53.862
Let's find out.

29:02.620 --> 29:05.655
♪ You know I'm a bad bitch ♪

29:05.689 --> 29:09.103
♪ And you don't wanna
mess with this ♪

29:09.137 --> 29:11.000
♪ Yeah, cause I'm a bad bitch ♪

29:11.034 --> 29:13.241
♪ Oh baby ♪

29:13.275 --> 29:15.000
- Best song ever.

29:15.034 --> 29:16.172
- You know it girl.

29:29.689 --> 29:32.310
- So, where the hell
is the wheelbarrow?

29:32.344 --> 29:33.344
- Must be inside.

29:36.586 --> 29:37.896
- Oh no, no way in.

29:37.931 --> 29:39.413
Let's bail.

29:39.448 --> 29:40.620
- We're breaking in.

29:44.965 --> 29:47.137
- Ah look, one for the geeks.

29:54.379 --> 29:55.700
- When did you learn
how to pick a lock?

29:55.724 --> 29:57.172
- I haven't yet.

29:57.206 --> 29:59.320
But I carry this just in case
of the Zombie Apocalypse.

29:59.344 --> 30:00.551
- Zombie apocalypse?

30:01.793 --> 30:02.907
- Everyone knows a
zombie can't break

30:02.931 --> 30:04.000
through a locked door.

30:05.413 --> 30:08.241
Yeah, I read in Zombie
Massacre, a Survival's Guide

30:08.275 --> 30:10.241
for the Average Teen,
that if we just locked

30:10.275 --> 30:13.068
all the doors we'd be safe
from the zombie apocalypse.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.620
But of course, that
means if someone

30:14.655 --> 30:16.182
were being trapped on the
other side of these doors

30:16.206 --> 30:17.206
we'd be screwed.

30:18.551 --> 30:20.965
So, voila!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.551
Zombie survivor gear number one.

30:23.586 --> 30:25.689
I got this bad boy from
the Zombie Network website.

30:25.724 --> 30:26.734
And if you get a pair
of goggles along--

30:26.758 --> 30:27.758
- Jack!

30:28.724 --> 30:30.068
- Sorry.

30:30.103 --> 30:31.355
- So can you pick
the lock or not?

30:31.379 --> 30:33.034
- Locks are surprisingly
easy to pick.

30:33.068 --> 30:36.482
You just have to twist this
thing until you hear a click.

30:36.517 --> 30:39.137
Then you move the tumbler
to the side, dammit.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.172
- Give me that.

30:48.793 --> 30:50.275
- Why am I not surprised?

30:51.310 --> 30:52.310
- Prom queens first.

31:26.689 --> 31:28.137
- That's it?

31:28.172 --> 31:29.172
This piece of shit?

31:30.275 --> 31:32.000
Has it always looked like this?

31:32.034 --> 31:35.551
- No, originally it was
in a much smaller place.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.200
They must have moved it after
they stopped giving tours.

31:40.827 --> 31:42.379
No, stop!

31:42.413 --> 31:44.613
That stuff will burn you if
you touch it without gloves.

31:47.586 --> 31:48.862
- Did somebody say gloves?

31:49.793 --> 31:51.000
- There's the wheelbarrow.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.103
Now let's get it
and get out of here.

31:53.137 --> 31:55.000
- Baby, come on, just a peak.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.206
Holy shit!

32:23.241 --> 32:24.562
- Do you think he's
actually in there?

32:24.586 --> 32:26.034
- Well, we've come this far.

32:26.068 --> 32:27.551
Let's find out.

32:27.586 --> 32:29.172
- Oh this ought to be good.

32:29.206 --> 32:30.758
- Okay guys, we can't do this.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.689
All right, we need
to get out of here.

32:32.724 --> 32:33.793
This isn't funny anymore.

32:33.827 --> 32:36.103
- God will strike us down.

32:36.137 --> 32:37.103
You need to change your
panties or something, man.

32:37.137 --> 32:39.034
- Shut the fuck up Tanner!

32:39.931 --> 32:41.206
- Calm down, calm down.

32:41.241 --> 32:42.034
We are just gonna take a look

32:42.068 --> 32:43.551
and close it back up.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.034
- Tanner, please don't.

32:54.620 --> 32:57.241
- You asshole, that's not funny!

32:57.275 --> 32:59.068
- No, that shit was hilarious.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.103
You got us Jack.

33:00.137 --> 33:01.000
Well played sir.

33:01.034 --> 33:02.482
I applaud you.

33:02.517 --> 33:04.793
- I almost peed my pants Jack.

33:04.827 --> 33:05.724
That was so mean.

33:05.758 --> 33:07.103
- Didn't you guys just see that?

33:07.137 --> 33:08.586
- See what?

33:08.620 --> 33:10.551
- Something grabbed me
and started to pull me in

33:10.586 --> 33:12.896
but then it just let go.

33:12.931 --> 33:15.448
- Okay, Jack you're
just fucking with us.

33:15.482 --> 33:16.413
Okay, there's nothing in there.

33:16.448 --> 33:17.655
This is bullshit.

33:17.689 --> 33:19.310
This is absolute
tourist bullshit

33:19.344 --> 33:20.655
that the town just made up

33:20.689 --> 33:22.655
to try and raise some money.

33:22.689 --> 33:24.275
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

33:25.724 --> 33:26.724
- Trist!

34:03.413 --> 34:04.413
- They opened it.

34:25.275 --> 34:27.310
- They opened it, make the call.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.379
- Little shits.

34:35.757 --> 34:38.793
This better be important.

34:38.827 --> 34:39.793
- I don't understand
why we went there

34:39.827 --> 34:40.896
in the first place.

34:40.931 --> 34:43.447
That's just so stupid.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.655
But you were hilarious.

34:45.688 --> 34:47.827
- You scared my school
pride, peeing my pants.

34:47.862 --> 34:49.896
- Fuck dude, the look on
your face was priceless.

34:49.931 --> 34:51.516
You should be a
fucking actor, man.

34:51.551 --> 34:53.310
- Jack, I give you credit.

34:53.344 --> 34:56.000
Queen boy here oughta
check his delicates.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.068
- Whatever, I'm out.

34:58.103 --> 35:00.023
I've had enough of this
freak show for one night.

35:01.517 --> 35:03.172
- Bye, text me when
you get home okay?

35:03.206 --> 35:04.413
- I will.

35:04.448 --> 35:05.728
- Bye
guys, drive safe.

35:09.103 --> 35:10.896
- Are you okay Jack?

35:10.931 --> 35:12.034
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:13.137 --> 35:14.310
Let's get you home.

35:17.586 --> 35:18.379
- Jack!

35:18.413 --> 35:19.413
- Fuck dude!

35:20.931 --> 35:22.206
You look white as a ghost.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.458
Well Casper, here,
obviously ain't

35:24.482 --> 35:25.344
taking you anywhere.

35:25.379 --> 35:26.586
I'll give you a ride.

35:26.620 --> 35:27.827
- The hell you will.

35:27.862 --> 35:30.000
You can't leave me here alone.

35:30.034 --> 35:32.241
I'm too tired to go with you.

35:32.275 --> 35:33.172
- So what, they're gonna walk?

35:33.206 --> 35:34.689
After what happened to Audrey?

35:37.137 --> 35:38.517
- Oh all right.

35:38.551 --> 35:39.827
You both can stay here.

35:40.965 --> 35:42.655
You too, it's late
and my brother

35:42.689 --> 35:45.551
and parents are in Grand
Junction for the weekend.

35:45.586 --> 35:47.275
Jack you can take
my brother's room.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.827
Brianna and Ivy, you
guys can have my room.

35:49.862 --> 35:51.620
It's the beautiful pink one.

35:51.655 --> 35:54.068
Tanner and I will
take the master.

35:54.103 --> 35:55.379
Come on, I'll show you guys.

35:57.931 --> 35:59.448
- Are you okay Jack?

35:59.482 --> 36:02.103
- I'm fine, I'll catch up
with you guys in a minute.

36:02.137 --> 36:03.206
I'm gonna call my mom.

36:25.413 --> 36:26.413
Hello, Mom?

36:27.827 --> 36:28.827
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:30.379 --> 36:32.655
I'm just not feeling
too well is all.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.103
So the team and I decided

36:34.137 --> 36:35.896
to stay at Heather's
house tonight.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.620
Okay, I love you too.

36:41.344 --> 36:42.344
Bye.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.724
- Um, yeah, you
can take the bed.

36:57.758 --> 36:58.931
I can't sleep anyways.

36:58.965 --> 37:00.965
I think I'll just
chill here for a while.

37:03.103 --> 37:04.103
- Okay.

37:09.206 --> 37:10.206
- Here you go.

37:11.068 --> 37:13.068
Jesus, jack you look like shit!

37:14.310 --> 37:17.482
- Good, that explains
why I feel this way.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.000
- Good night.

37:23.034 --> 37:24.068
- Good night.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.931
- So I'm kind of
worried about that geek

37:39.965 --> 37:41.586
in my brother's room.

37:41.620 --> 37:42.620
- Who, Jack?

37:44.103 --> 37:46.586
- Yeah, what are you watching?

38:03.827 --> 38:05.620
- What the hell!

38:05.655 --> 38:07.034
Is someone there?

38:09.310 --> 38:11.793
- Yes, they're coming for you.

38:13.620 --> 38:18.620
He will find you.

38:19.517 --> 38:21.413
- What are you talking about?

38:27.275 --> 38:29.068
- You've been touched.

38:30.931 --> 38:33.344
He decays all who he touches.

38:35.827 --> 38:37.241
He's coming for you.

38:37.275 --> 38:39.586
- Who, who will come for me?

39:53.862 --> 39:54.862
- Turn it off.

40:01.310 --> 40:03.310
So, I really do wanna

40:03.344 --> 40:04.344
talk about Ja--.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
What was that?

40:06.827 --> 40:08.068
- What?

40:08.103 --> 40:09.689
- I don't, I think
I heard something

40:09.724 --> 40:10.724
coming from outside.

40:12.137 --> 40:13.586
- I didn't hear anything.

40:14.551 --> 40:15.689
- Wait.

40:16.551 --> 40:17.551
There it is again.

40:18.379 --> 40:20.344
It's coming from under the bed.

40:21.758 --> 40:23.478
- Sweetie, you're just
a little freaked out.

40:25.379 --> 40:26.275
- You must have heard that?

40:26.310 --> 40:27.310
- No, nothing.

40:32.551 --> 40:33.831
- It's coming from
under the bed.

40:34.517 --> 40:36.517
- Babe, there's
nothing under the bed.

40:36.551 --> 40:38.413
- Would you just look?

40:38.448 --> 40:39.448
Please?

40:53.482 --> 40:55.896
Tanner, there's someone
in the bed with you.

41:02.206 --> 41:03.206
- Help me.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.000
- Stay out of the shed.

41:47.034 --> 41:48.517
- The shed, what?

41:48.551 --> 41:51.413
- There's dead people in there.

41:51.448 --> 41:53.379
They took our souls.

41:53.413 --> 41:55.517
Don't let them take yours.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.172
- Well don't you just
look like a million bucks?

42:45.206 --> 42:47.000
- Yeah, I didn't sleep well.

42:47.034 --> 42:48.344
Where are the other girls?

42:51.517 --> 42:53.034
- Ready to do this shit?

42:53.068 --> 42:54.310
- Well look at you.

42:54.344 --> 42:55.596
- Keep it in your
pants, big boy.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.793
Heather's going to
be here any minute.

42:57.827 --> 42:59.034
- Seriously jock strap.

42:59.068 --> 43:01.068
So where's cheer
bitch and the geeks?

43:01.103 --> 43:03.344
- Oh, speak of the devil.

43:04.517 --> 43:06.931
- All right, babe,
looking fine as ever.

43:06.965 --> 43:08.758
- Where the hell
were you last night?

43:08.793 --> 43:09.976
- I couldn't sleep,
so I went home

43:10.000 --> 43:11.838
for a few hours before
I had to come back here.

43:11.862 --> 43:13.689
Where is Jack?

43:13.724 --> 43:15.413
- I think he went
home last night too.

43:15.448 --> 43:18.103
We drove by his house
but no one answered.

43:18.137 --> 43:19.413
- Weird.

43:19.448 --> 43:21.344
- Yeah, it was a weird night.

43:23.724 --> 43:25.631
- Well at least we got the
hottest chicks on our team.

43:25.655 --> 43:26.862
Tristan, give me a hand.

43:27.862 --> 43:28.862
- Let's go.

44:06.000 --> 44:06.896
Let's go you guys.

44:06.931 --> 44:07.724
I can't do this by myself.

44:07.758 --> 44:09.000
- Um, I'm not a guy.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.103
- We probably need Jack.

44:14.758 --> 44:16.241
Oh my God, she just
flipped us off.

44:16.275 --> 44:17.586
- Who.

44:17.620 --> 44:18.379
- Her.

44:18.413 --> 44:19.413
- Hello everyone.

44:20.448 --> 44:24.275
Welcome to another
year of Halloween Fest.

44:29.172 --> 44:33.310
And now, the moment we've
all been waiting for.

44:33.344 --> 44:35.137
The wheelbarrow races.

44:41.172 --> 44:42.655
Here are the rules.

44:42.689 --> 44:45.413
Each team must push
their wheelbarrow from

44:45.448 --> 44:47.241
this goal line

44:48.137 --> 44:49.896
to that one

44:49.931 --> 44:51.758
and back again.

44:54.965 --> 44:58.137
But this year we're gonna
mix it up a little bit.

44:58.172 --> 45:00.758
Instead of filling the
wheelbarrow with dirt

45:00.793 --> 45:04.275
we're gonna fill it
with one dirt bag.

45:05.586 --> 45:07.620
That's right, one
member of the team

45:07.655 --> 45:11.275
must be in the
wheelbarrow at all times.

45:12.724 --> 45:16.206
The winning team will
receive a check for $2,000

45:21.551 --> 45:23.482
and a beautiful trophy.

45:26.620 --> 45:27.620
First team up,

45:28.827 --> 45:30.448
Henderson's misfits.

45:32.517 --> 45:34.344
- Tanner, the wheel is broken.

45:34.379 --> 45:36.793
- Classic, what a piece
of shit you built.

45:36.827 --> 45:37.907
- I could have built
a better wheelbarrow

45:37.931 --> 45:40.000
than this out of
glitter and a glue gun.

45:40.034 --> 45:41.286
- Okay, okay,
we'll make it work.

45:41.310 --> 45:42.586
Go over there with Heather.

45:42.620 --> 45:43.827
- Oh, this is so stupid.

45:44.724 --> 45:45.724
- Take your marks.

45:52.034 --> 45:53.448
- Ready, set, go!

46:00.620 --> 46:02.620
- Great Tanner, your piece
of shit creation cut me.

46:03.655 --> 46:05.689
- Oh, I ripped your tights.

46:05.724 --> 46:07.724
I'm so sorry about that.

46:09.482 --> 46:11.034
- Wow, Tristan thanks.

46:15.206 --> 46:16.551
- Police suspect foul play.

46:16.586 --> 46:19.241
And there are no new
leads in this case.

46:19.275 --> 46:21.448
Let's hope this,
is not another case

46:21.482 --> 46:22.965
that goes unsolved.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.482
So if you have any
information on Audrey Lowrey,

46:26.517 --> 46:29.310
please contact the sheriff's
department immediately.

46:29.344 --> 46:30.344
Back to you Amy.

46:33.172 --> 46:35.655
- Come on, I'm sure she's okay.

46:35.689 --> 46:36.689
She'll show up.

46:56.103 --> 46:57.862
- Ugh, there's
nothing to do here.

46:57.896 --> 46:58.689
- Hey, a psychic.

46:58.724 --> 47:00.068
We should do that.

47:00.103 --> 47:02.793
- Welcome, see what the
future holds for you.

47:02.827 --> 47:03.827
Come on in.

47:06.620 --> 47:07.620
- Why not?

47:15.172 --> 47:16.206
- Come on in.

47:17.344 --> 47:19.172
So, what'll it be this evening?

47:20.448 --> 47:22.206
A peek into the future?

47:22.241 --> 47:23.689
A Tarot card reading?

47:23.724 --> 47:24.793
A palm reading?

47:26.689 --> 47:27.724
Or how would you like

47:28.620 --> 47:29.758
to speak with the dead?

47:31.310 --> 47:33.034
- You can speak with the dead?

47:33.068 --> 47:35.344
- I have since I was a child.

47:35.379 --> 47:37.034
You know, most
clairvoyant's don't realize

47:37.068 --> 47:38.896
that they have the gift.

47:38.931 --> 47:42.103
They'll be visited by
spirits in their dreams.

47:42.137 --> 47:44.620
And they won't realize
that those dreams are real.

47:47.379 --> 47:48.931
So, what'll it be?

47:51.965 --> 47:53.655
- My best friend
has been missing.

47:55.137 --> 47:57.297
She has hasn't been seen or
heard from in two days now.

47:58.448 --> 48:00.000
Can you tell us what
happened to her?

48:02.310 --> 48:04.517
- Definitely, I'll
give it my best.

48:04.551 --> 48:05.793
Give me your hands child.

48:12.413 --> 48:13.413
Yes, yes.

48:17.344 --> 48:19.862
I see her, a pretty girl.

48:19.896 --> 48:21.172
Long blond hair.

48:23.103 --> 48:25.827
Yeah, she was last
seen with you.

48:28.827 --> 48:30.034
And she left alone

48:30.068 --> 48:31.348
and hasn't been
heard from since.

48:34.034 --> 48:37.000
Yeah, Pioneer Inn teen night.

48:39.758 --> 48:43.344
Yes, yes, yes,

48:44.965 --> 48:47.379
my vision's becoming more clear.

48:51.517 --> 48:52.517
I see a river.

48:53.206 --> 48:56.551
Danger, darkness, running, fear.

48:58.517 --> 49:01.482
She knows who they are.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.413
They've taken her.

49:04.448 --> 49:05.689
There's more than one.

49:07.551 --> 49:09.172
So many children.

49:09.206 --> 49:10.931
There's a room full of death.

49:14.379 --> 49:15.551
Coldness, ice.

49:16.586 --> 49:18.034
- I had a dream last night.

49:18.068 --> 49:19.941
Two kids came into my room
and told me about the shed.

49:19.965 --> 49:22.137
We should have
never gone in there.

49:22.172 --> 49:23.827
- Trapped, their
souls are trapped.

49:23.862 --> 49:24.976
He's overtaking their bodies.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.517
- Stop!

49:26.551 --> 49:27.758
- Are you okay?

49:27.793 --> 49:28.689
- Please, please
just make her stop.

49:28.724 --> 49:29.931
- The dead are disturbed.

49:29.965 --> 49:33.517
There's something
unnatural going on.

49:33.551 --> 49:35.896
You, you are in danger.

49:37.206 --> 49:39.965
He is trying to overtake you.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.241
He's coming for all of you.

49:42.275 --> 49:43.620
- Come on, let's
get out of here.

49:51.517 --> 49:53.310
- Holy shit, what an act!

49:53.344 --> 49:54.655
- Seriously.

49:54.689 --> 49:57.068
- Well, how do you think
she knew all that stuff?

49:57.103 --> 49:59.379
- Okay, so she guessed
what Audrey looked like.

49:59.413 --> 50:00.620
The rest was just made up.

50:00.655 --> 50:02.448
- Well she said
we were in danger.

50:02.482 --> 50:03.655
What do you think that meant?

50:03.689 --> 50:04.769
- Look Bri, you just
need to calm down okay?

50:04.793 --> 50:06.000
It was all just in fun.

50:06.034 --> 50:07.448
- Seriously, it's Halloween.

50:07.482 --> 50:08.896
She's supposed to scare us.

50:08.931 --> 50:10.517
- Well this calls for a drink.

50:10.551 --> 50:12.655
Come on, let's find
some soda for this rum.

50:13.896 --> 50:15.355
- Wait, Heather and
Tanner already left.

50:15.379 --> 50:16.275
They're actually at their
house waiting for us.

50:16.310 --> 50:18.034
And I think it's party time.

50:24.206 --> 50:25.665
Topping the news today,

50:25.689 --> 50:28.689
two murders and a robbery,
in less than 24 hours.

50:28.724 --> 50:30.724
Several city citizens
were in a panic

50:30.758 --> 50:34.827
after a gun battle on some
of their busy streets.

51:06.068 --> 51:08.655
- Dammit Jack, you're never
borrowing my car again.

51:19.137 --> 51:21.206
- So you pull a block and
follow the instructions.

51:21.241 --> 51:22.241
If you crash the tower

51:22.275 --> 51:24.310
you have to take two shots.

51:24.344 --> 51:26.413
Who wants to go first?

51:32.689 --> 51:35.241
- Take off an
article of clothing.

51:36.655 --> 51:37.758
- This should be good.

51:39.965 --> 51:40.896
- Okay, you're gonna
have to help me though.

51:40.931 --> 51:41.931
It's like, really tight.

51:41.965 --> 51:43.655
Pull it off.

51:43.689 --> 51:46.862
Right through my little head
like we're giving birth.

51:54.206 --> 51:56.000
- Okay, take two shots.

51:56.034 --> 51:57.241
- That's two.

51:57.275 --> 51:58.896
- That's
a double shot.

51:58.931 --> 52:00.068
- Tanner, you go.

52:04.413 --> 52:05.862
He always picks from the top.

52:14.896 --> 52:16.103
- Take four shots.

52:17.068 --> 52:18.310
- Make them count, no sips.

52:27.551 --> 52:28.551
- Ugh!

52:33.206 --> 52:35.793
- Kiss the person to your left.

52:44.310 --> 52:45.724
- Enough kissing!

53:01.310 --> 53:02.862
- That's two more shots for you.

53:02.896 --> 53:03.896
- Okay.

53:08.068 --> 53:09.482
- Got this.

53:12.034 --> 53:13.172
Kiss a girl.

53:16.517 --> 53:17.896
Yeah, not happening.

53:26.344 --> 53:27.344
- Oh no!

53:28.896 --> 53:31.103
- There is a penalty for that.

53:31.137 --> 53:31.931
- Definitely.

53:31.965 --> 53:33.103
- Pour up.

53:39.620 --> 53:41.896
Apologize to the
freaks and geeks.

53:41.931 --> 53:43.206
They're not so bad.

53:44.206 --> 53:45.827
- Tanner, that's so sweet.

53:45.862 --> 53:47.344
Now read what it really says.

53:50.068 --> 53:51.068
Kiss a guy!

53:52.172 --> 53:55.758
- Kiss Tristan, kiss
Tristan, kiss Tristan!

53:55.793 --> 53:57.000
- Not a chance.

53:57.034 --> 53:58.448
- Well come on,
he's kind of girly.

54:01.241 --> 54:02.448
- Take four more shots.

54:04.344 --> 54:06.482
- This one's so full.

54:14.275 --> 54:17.862
- Maybe you should see
who's on the bottle?

54:24.827 --> 54:26.379
- She's out.

54:26.413 --> 54:28.241
- All right, this one's a goner.

54:28.275 --> 54:29.551
- Don't bother her.

54:29.586 --> 54:31.620
She's cute when she sleeps.

54:31.655 --> 54:33.620
- We need to get
her to bed, come on.

54:33.655 --> 54:35.379
- I'll take her to my room.

54:35.413 --> 54:36.379
Come on, come on.

54:36.413 --> 54:38.137
- Good night Brianna.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.241
- You know, I saw
footprints in that shed

55:05.275 --> 55:06.551
and drag marks next to them.

55:07.655 --> 55:10.000
They led to a back room.

55:10.034 --> 55:11.034
- No shit?

55:13.655 --> 55:16.344
I had a dream about
Audrey last night.

55:16.379 --> 55:17.379
- And?

55:18.413 --> 55:19.551
- I don't know.

55:19.586 --> 55:20.724
It was just a dream but

55:22.344 --> 55:23.344
it was so real.

55:24.551 --> 55:26.482
She was asking for my help.

55:26.517 --> 55:27.758
- Help?

55:27.793 --> 55:29.517
Shit Tanner, what if
it wasn't a dream?

55:29.551 --> 55:31.965
What if it was, like, a
premonition or something?

55:33.172 --> 55:35.655
There's no fucking way
Audrey ran away, okay?

55:35.689 --> 55:37.551
I know her, she just
wouldn't do that.

55:40.137 --> 55:43.827
I think, well, I think
her disappearance

55:43.862 --> 55:46.206
might have something
to do with that shed

55:46.241 --> 55:47.344
and those drag marks.

55:50.068 --> 55:52.241
- Okay then, let's do this.

55:52.275 --> 55:53.275
- Hold it.

55:54.379 --> 55:55.758
Oh, gotta go.

55:58.620 --> 56:02.137
- Wait, Heather's got a
camcorder in here somewhere.

56:39.517 --> 56:40.517
- Hello?

56:42.758 --> 56:44.137
Is someone there?

57:13.862 --> 57:16.448
- Jack, where the
hell have you been?

57:17.965 --> 57:18.965
- Mom?

57:20.206 --> 57:21.758
I'm so sorry.

57:21.793 --> 57:22.793
They took me.

57:24.172 --> 57:25.172
- What?

57:26.586 --> 57:27.758
What are you talking about?

57:27.793 --> 57:29.000
Who took you?

57:29.034 --> 57:30.275
Where are you Jack?

57:31.551 --> 57:32.965
- The body keepers, Mom.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.103
It's real, it's all real.

57:34.137 --> 57:35.551
They took me and
they put me in--

57:39.620 --> 57:40.448
- I can't hear you.

57:40.482 --> 57:42.000
Where are you Jack?

57:43.275 --> 57:45.241
- The body keepers, Mom.

57:45.275 --> 57:46.275
The shed.

57:47.620 --> 57:49.413
I need help.

57:51.620 --> 57:52.413
- Jack, what are you saying?

57:52.448 --> 57:53.482
Are you all right?

57:57.482 --> 57:59.034
- Mom, I'm tied up.

58:12.896 --> 58:14.000
- Jack, Jack?

58:15.137 --> 58:16.137
Jack!

58:48.379 --> 58:49.379
Jack, Jack!

58:51.620 --> 58:52.620
Jack!

58:58.586 --> 59:00.665
- 9-1-1, what's
the nature of your emergency?

59:00.689 --> 59:02.793
- My son, Jack.

59:02.827 --> 59:04.103
He's in trouble.

59:04.137 --> 59:05.862
He's been taken.

59:05.896 --> 59:07.965
I think he might
be at the old shed.

59:09.137 --> 59:12.551
Please send somebody
right now, please.

59:12.586 --> 59:14.448
- Three 32 Robert.

59:14.482 --> 59:18.551
Need certified at 535 Pine
Grove, 535 Pine Grove.

59:56.620 --> 59:57.620
- Help me.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.172
- Oh my God.

01:00:00.206 --> 01:00:01.482
Audrey?

01:00:01.517 --> 01:00:02.965
How did you get here?

01:00:04.172 --> 01:00:06.655
God, you're hurt, let's
get you out of here.

01:00:06.689 --> 01:00:08.275
- Gi meg din sjel.

01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:09.482
- What?

01:00:09.517 --> 01:00:10.344
You're not making any sense.

01:00:10.379 --> 01:00:11.724
- Gi meg din sjel.

01:00:19.517 --> 01:00:20.931
Gi meg din sjel!

01:00:45.793 --> 01:00:47.758
- Hey Ivy, I don't know.

01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:54.172
Okay, let's do this.

01:01:00.827 --> 01:01:01.827
- Shit!

01:01:05.758 --> 01:01:07.965
Tanner, we've got to
get back into that shed.

01:01:19.965 --> 01:01:21.448
Impressive.

01:01:21.482 --> 01:01:23.137
- Yeah, I always
had it in my car.

01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:25.899
I just didn't wanna
make Jack feel bad.

01:01:44.689 --> 01:01:45.689
Here.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.448
Where did you see
those footprints?

01:01:51.482 --> 01:01:52.482
- This way.

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:12.517
- What is that smell?

01:02:12.551 --> 01:02:14.620
- It smells like rotten
meat or something.

01:02:17.551 --> 01:02:18.551
- Oh God.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.620
- Please tell me
you're getting this.

01:02:25.655 --> 01:02:27.206
- I'm getting this.

01:02:41.862 --> 01:02:43.931
- Shit, look at this.

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:55.034
- What is all this?

01:03:07.206 --> 01:03:08.103
It looks like they
thawed grandpa out

01:03:08.137 --> 01:03:09.689
about five years ago.

01:03:09.724 --> 01:03:11.689
Just about the time
they moved him here.

01:03:16.137 --> 01:03:17.896
It says here, they've
been trying to use

01:03:17.931 --> 01:03:20.896
organ replacements
to re, re, rein--

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:22.172
- re-innervate.

01:03:28.827 --> 01:03:30.000
This is some sick shit.

01:03:32.241 --> 01:03:34.034
Looks like they were
trying to revive grandpa

01:03:34.068 --> 01:03:35.068
with fresh organs.

01:03:36.137 --> 01:03:37.320
- Yeah and when
that didn't work,

01:03:37.344 --> 01:03:38.931
it's like they were
trying to search

01:03:38.965 --> 01:03:42.655
for a new way to,
soul transformation?

01:03:44.137 --> 01:03:45.137
- Harvesting souls.

01:03:48.137 --> 01:03:49.103
- Looks like they've
been searching

01:03:49.137 --> 01:03:50.793
for host bodies to inhabit.

01:03:55.275 --> 01:03:58.241
Audrey's name is listed here.

01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:04.482
- This is her necklace.

01:04:04.517 --> 01:04:05.586
- You're sure?

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.827
- Yes, I'm sure.

01:04:06.862 --> 01:04:08.182
She was wearing
it at the Pioneer.

01:04:18.103 --> 01:04:19.758
- Henderson, what
is he doing here?

01:04:22.448 --> 01:04:23.758
- At least it's not Audrey.

01:04:30.586 --> 01:04:32.448
- Jack, jack, wake up buddy!

01:04:32.482 --> 01:04:34.517
Jack, wake up, let's
get out of here!

01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:35.551
Come on Jack.

01:05:07.172 --> 01:05:09.827
What the fuck is going on?

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:11.000
- What the fuck?

01:05:11.034 --> 01:05:13.379
- Oh you silly, silly girl.

01:05:14.275 --> 01:05:15.758
Grandpa was right.

01:05:15.793 --> 01:05:18.137
Being the gay BFF
made it so easy

01:05:18.172 --> 01:05:19.758
to collect everyone's DNA.

01:05:21.103 --> 01:05:23.517
I fucking told you not
to go in that shed.

01:05:23.551 --> 01:05:24.700
If you would have
just listened to me

01:05:24.724 --> 01:05:26.482
none of this would be happening.

01:05:26.517 --> 01:05:29.000
Now I have to do all
this cluster fuck.

01:05:29.034 --> 01:05:32.379
- You killed Mr. Henderson
and Jack, too, didn't you?

01:05:32.413 --> 01:05:33.413
Why?

01:05:34.793 --> 01:05:36.689
- Mr. Henderson provided
my great grandfather

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.068
with a great host
body, for years.

01:05:39.103 --> 01:05:41.068
But his body became
riddled with cancer.

01:05:42.655 --> 01:05:45.724
You see, diseased
bodies reject the soul.

01:05:46.965 --> 01:05:49.620
- So Audrey was the
perfect specimen?

01:05:49.655 --> 01:05:51.172
You sick fuck, you're dead!

01:05:51.206 --> 01:05:52.766
- No one else should
have been involved.

01:05:54.724 --> 01:05:55.724
- What about Jack?

01:05:56.931 --> 01:05:58.517
- He got in the way.

01:05:58.551 --> 01:05:59.689
- What did you do to Jack?

01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:00.965
- He touched my farfar.

01:06:03.379 --> 01:06:05.379
He doesn't like his
body to be disturbed.

01:06:06.827 --> 01:06:10.068
So, he was eliminated.

01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:13.137
You people treat my
great grandfather

01:06:13.172 --> 01:06:14.862
like he's some
sort of freak show.

01:06:15.827 --> 01:06:17.034
He was a brilliant man.

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.793
Well worth the cost of
a few useless lives.

01:06:22.482 --> 01:06:24.103
- I'll show you useless lives.

01:06:27.586 --> 01:06:28.931
No, please stop!

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.827
No, no please stop!

01:06:40.172 --> 01:06:42.379
- You love death so much, Ivy.

01:06:42.413 --> 01:06:43.517
Well, guess what?

01:06:44.586 --> 01:06:47.034
Now you get to
experience it firsthand.

01:06:47.068 --> 01:06:48.068
- Let her go.

01:06:50.827 --> 01:06:54.827
- Naughty boy, would
you care to watch?

01:06:54.862 --> 01:06:57.000
No wait, we know you would.

01:06:58.448 --> 01:07:00.689
- You've fucking lost it,
you sick son of a bitch.

01:07:00.724 --> 01:07:03.413
- No, I found it.

01:07:03.448 --> 01:07:05.172
So shut up because
it's too late.

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.068
You see, farfar realized that

01:07:09.103 --> 01:07:11.275
the only way to keep
his own body alive

01:07:12.275 --> 01:07:14.551
was through blood transfusion

01:07:14.586 --> 01:07:16.172
with genetically matching blood.

01:07:17.758 --> 01:07:20.241
It seems Goth girl
here's the perfect match.

01:07:23.068 --> 01:07:26.724
The irony is, your poorly
constructed wheelbarrow cut her,

01:07:26.758 --> 01:07:28.655
giving me the perfect sample.

01:07:28.689 --> 01:07:30.000
And not only that

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.344
but you brought her
to our doorstep.

01:07:33.379 --> 01:07:35.724
So you see Tanner,
in the end of things

01:07:37.344 --> 01:07:38.827
you are the hero.

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:45.275
Now this, you're
gonna wanna see.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:47.379
You wanted to see my
grandfather so bad?

01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:51.275
Well now I guess all
that's left to show you

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:53.000
is what re-innervation
looks like.

01:07:54.448 --> 01:07:56.482
- Now comes the fun part.

01:08:03.482 --> 01:08:06.965
- Now then, over here
on my little table

01:08:08.344 --> 01:08:09.793
I have several knives.

01:08:11.206 --> 01:08:14.620
Don't worry, I keep their
edges extremely sharp.

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.379
You like knives, don't you Ivy?

01:08:24.551 --> 01:08:26.792
You won't feel the
initial incision

01:08:26.827 --> 01:08:30.412
but you might feel a little
pain from the blood loss.

01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:32.171
- Stop, Tristan, please!

01:08:33.068 --> 01:08:34.482
- I'm sorry Tanner.

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:35.620
I wasn't asking you.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.654
Why are you so scared Ivy?

01:08:41.171 --> 01:08:42.654
Don't you like blood?

01:08:49.586 --> 01:08:50.517
Don't worry babe.

01:08:50.551 --> 01:08:51.930
This is a bloodletting tube.

01:08:53.103 --> 01:08:55.654
So just do me a
favor, sit still.

01:09:01.758 --> 01:09:03.517
- Freeze, don't move!

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:13.482
They're taking off!

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:14.517
Call for back up.

01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:22.482
- Requesting backup,
575 Hidden Trail Road

01:09:22.517 --> 01:09:23.517
at the old shed.

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:26.448
- 10-4,
all units be advised,

01:09:26.482 --> 01:09:27.689
we have a pursuit in progress.

01:09:27.724 --> 01:09:28.907
All units on non
essential call are

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.068
directed to clear and
standby to assist.

01:09:32.344 --> 01:09:33.344
- You stay here.

01:09:56.172 --> 01:09:57.172
He's gone.

01:10:16.517 --> 01:10:18.793
- All right Miss McCoy.

01:10:18.827 --> 01:10:21.275
Walk me through what
happened last night.

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:22.793
And when you found
Brianna Miller

01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:24.827
dead in your bathroom.

01:10:24.862 --> 01:10:26.344
- We were drinking last night.

01:10:28.206 --> 01:10:30.551
And she had a lot to
drink so I put her to bed.

01:10:32.137 --> 01:10:35.482
When I woke up this
morning everybody was gone,

01:10:35.517 --> 01:10:37.068
so I went to check on her.

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:40.137
I thought she was
passed out but,

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:44.206
or at least I thought she was.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.551
But she wasn't breathing and
I didn't know what to do.

01:10:46.586 --> 01:10:47.724
So I called you guys--

01:10:48.586 --> 01:10:49.689
- Okay, calm down.

01:10:49.724 --> 01:10:52.172
We found your boyfriend, Tanner.

01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:53.448
- Well can I see him?

01:10:53.482 --> 01:10:55.172
Where was he?
- No, just sit down.

01:10:58.068 --> 01:11:00.551
We need to know
when exactly you all

01:11:00.586 --> 01:11:01.931
broke into that shed.

01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:07.896
We found several dead
bodies in that shed.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.758
We need to know exactly
when you entered that shed.

01:11:12.241 --> 01:11:15.517
- We were just going in there
for a wheelbarrow, that's all.

01:11:15.551 --> 01:11:16.551
There were no,

01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:19.482
we didn't see any dead bodies.

01:11:21.172 --> 01:11:23.793
- What's your relationship
with Tristan Swensen?

01:11:25.034 --> 01:11:26.379
- He's my best friend.

01:11:27.655 --> 01:11:28.655
Where is he?

01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:30.758
- He's missing.

01:11:32.137 --> 01:11:34.344
And so is the body of
his dead grandfather.

01:11:36.724 --> 01:11:37.862
- His grandfather?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.793
- Have a seat.

01:11:45.827 --> 01:11:47.482
We need to show
you both something.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:04.631
We need to know if
either one of you

01:12:04.655 --> 01:12:07.137
recognize any of the
teens on this video.

01:12:09.137 --> 01:12:11.275
- Help me, help me!

01:12:33.551 --> 01:12:34.551
- Help me.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.896
- Well, the boy in this
video is Craig Westerman.

01:14:02.931 --> 01:14:05.034
He's been missing for
almost two years now.

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:07.424
Did either of you recognize any

01:14:07.448 --> 01:14:09.206
of the other teens
on this video?

01:14:10.586 --> 01:14:12.103
No, okay.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.000
Tell us what you
know about this shed.

01:14:18.206 --> 01:14:20.827
- Ivy and I, we went
back to the shed

01:14:20.862 --> 01:14:22.862
after we broke in
the first night.

01:14:22.896 --> 01:14:25.862
We were looking
for Audrey Lowrey.

01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:27.862
That's where we found
Jack, and Mr. Henderson,

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.793
and that room with
everything else.

01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:32.551
The jars, the body
parts, and they

01:14:32.586 --> 01:14:34.148
kept saying body
keepers, they kept saying

01:14:34.172 --> 01:14:35.379
body keepers, body keepers--

01:14:35.413 --> 01:14:36.413
- Whoa, slow down son.

01:14:37.655 --> 01:14:38.896
Tell me about Jack.

01:14:42.068 --> 01:14:43.551
- We found him dead.

01:14:43.586 --> 01:14:44.965
Slumped over in that chair.

01:14:46.137 --> 01:14:48.206
He'd been missing
since Friday night.

01:14:49.965 --> 01:14:51.241
- And Mr. Henderson?

01:14:54.034 --> 01:14:55.514
- I don't know how
he got in the shed.

01:14:56.379 --> 01:14:58.172
- Well, we do.

01:14:58.206 --> 01:15:00.896
Seems this operation's been
going on for some time now.

01:15:03.241 --> 01:15:05.620
It turns out Tristan Swensen

01:15:05.655 --> 01:15:07.896
is the great grandson
of grandpa Swensen.

01:15:07.931 --> 01:15:10.448
When the family moved
him here years ago

01:15:10.482 --> 01:15:12.724
they tried to bring
him back to life.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.620
And they've been running
a type of butcher shop

01:15:15.655 --> 01:15:17.655
out of that shed, ever since.

01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:20.103
We found several
bodies in there,

01:15:20.137 --> 01:15:22.586
including the two missing
children from Eldora.

01:15:24.862 --> 01:15:26.931
The other's we haven't
identified yet.

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:32.551
