00:02.670 --> 00:04.572
Previously on Empire...
COOKIE: Jermel!

00:04.605 --> 00:07.375
HAKEEM: Thank you for
being there when I needed you.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.078
LUCIOUS:
I got three sons,

00:10.111 --> 00:12.413
and I identify more with
you than any one of them.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.815
COOKIE: Jamal wants
my feedback on a song.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.484
LAZ: Your ex would have
a problem with that?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.186
A problem with my ex.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.587
A problem with my other son.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.055
We're supposed to be
in competition.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.823
HAKEEM: I know about you
and pretty boy.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.892
I know what I'm doing.
Well, I don't trust him.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.228
Please don't
say that to me.

00:27.261 --> 00:29.197
It's just all taking
a little longer than expected.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.866
Swiftstream-- it's ripe
and ready for a merger.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.735
I'm not selling.
Well, I'm not buying.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.836
I'm looking for a partner.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.038
MIMI:
Jago Locke.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.273
He wants to be
in business with you.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.374
It's done.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.677
* Had hit records
on my demo... *

00:43.711 --> 00:46.180
Lucious, this is
going too far.

00:46.214 --> 00:50.084
There's got to be a less
painful way to reach your son.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.452
Just think about it.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.354
* And anything I got
is not a rental... *

00:53.387 --> 00:55.389
LUCIOUS: Hey, now y'all know
the old saying...

00:55.423 --> 00:56.624
(crowd cheering)

00:56.657 --> 00:59.627
...a hard head makes a soft ass.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.796
Well, sometimes the only way
to get somebody's attention

01:02.830 --> 01:05.799
is to hit them in the head
with a sledgehammer.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.902
Now, I'm not an Internet dude,

01:08.936 --> 01:12.306
but I respect
you vloggers and bloggers

01:12.340 --> 01:14.942
and you whatevers
for the fact that

01:14.975 --> 01:18.246
you're able to reach the
world instantaneously.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.081
Well, I got a message I
want to send to Hakeem.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.584
It's uncut, it's raw.

01:23.617 --> 01:27.788
It's Freda Gatz
with shots fired!

01:27.821 --> 01:28.789
(crowd cheering)

01:28.822 --> 01:31.159
(machine gun sound effect)

01:33.494 --> 01:35.062
FREDA:
Uh.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.397
(crowd cheering)

01:36.430 --> 01:38.899
Hey, Lucious, I heard
there was shots fired, huh?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.835
(whoops)

01:41.869 --> 01:43.571
They want war?
(siren blaring over speakers)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.506
I thought blood
was thicker than water.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.507
(music begins)

01:46.540 --> 01:48.642
But a lie
don't care who tell it.

01:48.676 --> 01:51.078
* Started from the bottom
wit' a eight ball *

01:51.111 --> 01:52.813
* Always talkin' money,
boy, I hate y'all *

01:52.846 --> 01:54.948
* I was in the hood
tryin' to make that thing flip *

01:54.982 --> 01:56.950
* Posted on the mound,
got me watchin' for the pitch *

01:56.984 --> 01:58.652
* You don't wanna be the man,
guess I'll be it for ya *

01:58.686 --> 02:00.821
* I got you goin' nuts,
I see the paranoia *

02:00.854 --> 02:02.990
* Daddy's little son
actin' like a daughter *

02:03.023 --> 02:04.658
* Now go and get it, get it,
just like daddy taught ya *

02:04.692 --> 02:06.927
* The king of the jungle's
a lion *

02:06.960 --> 02:08.596
* But you ain't no king,
boy, you lyin' *

02:08.629 --> 02:10.664
* You cry to your mother

02:10.698 --> 02:12.132
* 'Cause you ain't as good
as your brother *

02:12.166 --> 02:13.133
* I come from the gutter

02:13.167 --> 02:14.935
* In my hood, you a sucka

02:14.968 --> 02:17.205
* I'm knowing you softer than
butter, let's keep it 100 *

02:17.238 --> 02:18.806
* If you look around, boy,
I'm the son *

02:18.839 --> 02:20.107
* That your dad always wanted

02:20.140 --> 02:22.710
* Look at
daddy's little girl, girl *

02:22.743 --> 02:24.945
* There she go *
Come on now, son.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.381
* You just daddy's little girl
Hakeem is gonna flip out.

02:27.415 --> 02:29.817
* Hey, baby. *

02:31.252 --> 02:35.356
Hakeem, don't be weirded out
if it's awkward this first time.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.157
First time?

02:37.191 --> 02:38.659
As in virgin?

02:40.328 --> 02:42.863
As in you following me around
like a little puppy after this?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.365
I knew I shouldn't
have told you.
Hey.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.666
Look, what we got is
something special,

02:45.699 --> 02:47.067
and I don't want
to mess that up.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.869
I just want to make sure
I treat it right.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.904
Look, I got you something.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.243
I designed
it myself.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.312
Every single
detail perfect.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.881
It's for my princess.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.916
It's beautiful.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.153
You know, we could
take our time.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.321
We ain't got to rush.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.922
*

03:15.463 --> 03:16.697
(phone chirps)

03:18.031 --> 03:21.502
Freda Gatz
going in on me?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.537
Hold on, baby.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.347
* Gon' make me have the goons
come get that *

03:33.381 --> 03:35.015
* Leave your little ass
kidnapped *

03:35.048 --> 03:37.117
* My bad, you already did that

03:37.150 --> 03:39.387
* In my hood, you a sucka,
I'm knowing you softer *

03:39.420 --> 03:41.355
* Than butter,
let's keep it 100 *

03:41.389 --> 03:42.723
* If you look around, boy

03:42.756 --> 03:44.258
* I'm the son
that your dad always wanted *

03:44.292 --> 03:46.560
* Look at
daddy's little girl, girl *

03:46.594 --> 03:48.195
* There she go *

03:48.228 --> 03:50.731
* You just
daddy's little girl, girl *

03:50.764 --> 03:52.733
* Hey, baby *
* Look at...

04:04.978 --> 04:06.980
*

04:19.192 --> 04:20.894
Dad. It's so sick.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.296
Crazy.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.231
Y'all, it's so...
it's-it's incredible.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.733
That's because
it comes from

04:25.766 --> 04:28.402
a passionate
commitment, Jamal.

04:28.436 --> 04:29.903
Music is a part
of Pepsi's DNA.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.238
We have a long history

04:31.271 --> 04:32.573
of getting behind
emerging artists

04:32.606 --> 04:34.274
and partnering
with iconic stars.

04:34.308 --> 04:37.645
Wait a minute,
if y'all are so hyped on my son,

04:37.678 --> 04:39.447
why are y'all
out to other artists?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.416
Jamal has a real shot at
becoming the new face of Pepsi.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.917
We're really only out
to ten other artists.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.953
Oh, my God,
that's a damn cattle call.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.821
Dad, stop. Chill out.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.790
Seriously, like,
I-I get it.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.759
It's fine. I would be honored
to submit a song

04:51.792 --> 04:53.327
for your consideration.
Great.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.329
Well, I'll work with you
to make sure it's right.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.764
No interference, of course.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.765
Just support.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.932
And if
your song's chosen...

04:58.966 --> 05:01.268
Dad, if the song
is chosen...

05:01.301 --> 05:02.636
You hear this?
(laughs)

05:02.670 --> 05:04.438
But that's just
the energy we want.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.106
But the window's tight.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.041
You have to submit your
song within the week.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.142
Okay.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.277
LUCIOUS: He will make
the deadline, trust me.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.779
In fact,
I'll go in the studio with him

05:11.812 --> 05:13.180
and help make this

05:13.213 --> 05:15.182
powerful, incredible,
dope-ass song.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.951
Okay, we look
forward to it.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.853
We're really excited
about you for this, Jamal.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.123
The key to getting
this campaign is the song.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.157
Make it great.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.795
MIMI: Wall Street's
going to go negative

05:27.828 --> 05:29.730
on Empire if we don't
close this streaming deal.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.198
I don't give a damn, man.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.534
Wall Street
can kiss my black ass.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.068
And you can kiss my white one.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.070
I have 250 million on the line.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.473
Mimi, Jago Locke jacked up
the price after we already

05:39.507 --> 05:40.541
agreed to terms.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.376
Now, Empire would have to
liquidate assets.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.513
No. Let Jago liquidate
his own damn assets.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.882
Or better yet, why don't
we liquidate his brain stem?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.317
And have the feds raid again?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.986
Why can't you
go for the win?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.555
I don't know
who you think you talking to,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.390
but watch your tone with me.
Pop.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.827
I can't deal with my life
until you get this done.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.531
So you come with something
better, or let's close this.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.869
(door closes)

06:08.902 --> 06:12.573
That is a dangerous way to come
at our biggest investor, Pop.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.075
This is business,
it is not a rap battle.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.510
Oh, it's all the same to me,

06:16.544 --> 06:18.679
as long as I win
in the end of it.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.014
That's why you want
to humiliate Hakeem?

06:21.048 --> 06:23.517
So you can win
in the end?

06:23.551 --> 06:26.219
That's why you want to control
all of us? Not to teach us?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.522
Not to make us
better men?

06:28.556 --> 06:30.090
But just so you can
win in the end?

06:30.123 --> 06:31.692
Well, I think history has shown

06:31.725 --> 06:33.927
you're a much better man
under my control.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.863
As a matter of fact,
why don't you

06:35.896 --> 06:38.365
get Thirsty on the line
and tell him to dig up some dirt

06:38.398 --> 06:42.269
on Jago Locke so I can have him
under my control as well.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.572
How about that?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.607
*

06:50.444 --> 06:52.713
* I get up with my mind

06:52.746 --> 06:54.548
* Stay on the grind

06:54.582 --> 06:56.249
* Everything will be mine

06:56.283 --> 06:57.585
* Including you...

06:57.618 --> 06:59.052
You better sing!

06:59.086 --> 07:00.420
(laughs):
* Eyes on the prize

07:00.454 --> 07:02.055
* Gonna make you realize

07:02.089 --> 07:03.891
* My goal is the sky

07:03.924 --> 07:05.893
* It's what I do.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.395
Yes, yes!

07:08.428 --> 07:09.897
Your keys are shining, baby.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.899
I think it's perfect, Mom.
I love working with you.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.266
Yeah, I know you do,

07:13.300 --> 07:15.569
'cause you can feel
when it's real. (chuckles)

07:15.603 --> 07:16.904
It's only a matter of time

07:16.937 --> 07:18.405
before you come on
back home with us.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.407
Mom, Dad would kill us
if he knew that we were

07:20.440 --> 07:22.910
working together; he'd probably
shut the whole thing down.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.778
You know what kind of magic
we make together.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.914
Why would you want to hide that?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.281
Because this deal is everything.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.783
Like, literally, this is it.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.285
I can't have Dad get mad
and messing the whole thing up,

07:32.319 --> 07:33.754
which you know he would.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.088
Jamal, you have leverage.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.323
Tell him the truth.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.158
Hell, let me tell his ass
the truth.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.430
I know y'all wondering about

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
this Freda Gatz chick
coming at me.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.100
What, y'all don't think
I'm my own man?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.602
Y'all think that
my father's little pet

07:48.636 --> 07:50.938
can take my last name?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.273
No, I ain't
going down like that.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.275
I'm here to tell all you frauds
and you haters

07:55.308 --> 07:56.777
and Lucious Lyon, too,

07:56.810 --> 07:59.179
I'm-a battle Freda Gatz
for my last name.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.615
And I'm-a show the whole world
who the real Lyon is.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.350
Yeah, boy!
Ah! Yes.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.619
(whoops)
Show 'em, baby!

08:05.653 --> 08:07.788
I ain't playing.
I ain't playing with that chick.
That's it, brother.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.790
Murder, murder!
I'm not playing.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.359
*

08:37.517 --> 08:39.720
*

08:52.700 --> 08:55.502
(line rings, beeps)

08:55.535 --> 08:57.237
Hey, Hakeem, it's me.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.506
I was just calling
because, um...

08:59.539 --> 09:02.676
I just wanted to talk to you
about something.

09:02.710 --> 09:06.179
So just when you have a moment,
give me a call back.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.615
Okay, bye.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.750
(sighs)

09:15.623 --> 09:17.457
LAZ: Every single blogger
is talking about it.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.759
Hakeem versus Freda Gatz.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.327
I mean, it's trending
right now. Look.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.395
Ma, where you been?

09:22.429 --> 09:25.032
Boy, how in the hell

09:25.065 --> 09:27.735
could you let Lucious
sucker you into a rap battle?

09:27.768 --> 09:29.036
That's what ol' boy told you,

09:29.069 --> 09:30.804
that Lucious suckered me
into a rap battle?

09:30.838 --> 09:32.906
Look, Keem, I'm not trying
to start any problems.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.141
Hey, brah, I'm not sure

09:34.174 --> 09:36.109
that you should be
calling me "Keem," dawg.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.278
You already got my mom
turnt up, so you clearly

09:38.311 --> 09:39.880
starting problems
right now.
Hey!

09:39.913 --> 09:42.449
We are trying
to get this cookout going,

09:42.482 --> 09:44.551
and you go and
announce to the world

09:44.584 --> 09:46.787
that you are
battling Freda Gatz.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.623
Now, do you understand
if she wrecks you,

09:49.657 --> 09:52.225
we lose all cred
before we even had any?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.794
That's what he told you?
She gonna wreck me?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.562
Freda Gatz is a animal.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.430
Now, I'm not
taking anything

09:57.464 --> 10:01.468
away from your talent, baby,
but that is not what you do.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.903
Look...

10:02.936 --> 10:04.805
Laz, I swear to God, man,
say something else, dawg.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.274
Look, don't start getting
emotional, boy, because

10:07.307 --> 10:08.776
I swear, right...
Mom, stop!

10:08.809 --> 10:11.078
You emotional, not me.
I'm on point, like always.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.613
I'm not just popping
on social media.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.582
I'm number four
in the top ten slots.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.920
Because of me, every move Empire
makes promotes Lyon Dynasty.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.922
So, really, I suckered them.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.423
That's if you win.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.492
And thirdly, I don't even
know why you talking.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.094
Is he a partner?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.763
No, you a punk-ass promoter,
so go hand out some flyers

10:29.797 --> 10:31.264
and put them on them walls
over there,

10:31.298 --> 10:32.599
and get up out of here, man.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.267
It's okay, babe.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.535
Ain't no flyers under here?

10:35.568 --> 10:36.636
COOKIE:
It's all good.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.105
Yeah, it's time to go, man.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.106
See you later.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.473
Okay.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.641
All right.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.977
(chuckles):
Hakeem.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.313
You got heart.
Don't do this, man.
COOKIE: Hakeem, back off.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.281
Hakeem, back off.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.118
Hey! Hey! Look!

10:51.151 --> 10:52.786
Don't you touch my son!

10:52.820 --> 10:54.988
Okay? Don't ever touch my son!

10:55.022 --> 10:57.157
You get that?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.460
Look, if you lose,

11:00.493 --> 11:03.630
we become Empire's bitch.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.033
And for a start-up
company like us--

11:06.066 --> 11:08.301
look at me--

11:08.335 --> 11:10.537
that's the end,
you understand?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.806
But, Mom, she's trying
to take my name.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.474
You think I'm gonna
allow that to happen?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.477
If I lose, I lose more
than Lyon Dynasty.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.179
I'm-a make that bitch
my bitch.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.052
You better.

11:29.089 --> 11:32.492
Jamal, I need to know
where we stand, baby.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.062
I mean, Hakeem is
fighting for his life,

11:35.095 --> 11:36.496
I'm fighting for you.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.031
What's up with us, boo?

11:38.065 --> 11:39.666
I know, Mom.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.069
(door buzzer sounds)

11:45.605 --> 11:47.540
Mom...
What?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.176
Mom, it's Lucious.
It's Dad.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.378
Mom, go, go, go.
The closet, up there, please!

11:51.411 --> 11:52.746
(elevator bell dings)

11:52.780 --> 11:54.214
Got it.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.448
Yo, what's up, Dad?

11:55.482 --> 11:56.683
Got the song, man.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.518
I was... I was
going crazy all night.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.087
I-I was working
with Thirsty,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.889
trying to deal with
this Stream thing,

12:01.922 --> 12:04.057
and it hit me
out of nowhere.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.059
It hit me,
and it's so beautiful.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.261
I got the song.
Been in the studio all night.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.362
Song for Pepsi?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.363
Yes, the Pepsi song.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.531
All right,
well, let's hear.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.699
I-I got something,
too, though.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.134
LUCIOUS:
No. No, no, no.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.436
The moment you hear this,
it's a rap. It's a rap.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.371
It's a rap. It's a rap.
Bing, bing, bing.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.107
Go. Go for it.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.741
(upbeat electronic music
playing)

12:21.775 --> 12:24.544
See what I'm saying?

12:24.577 --> 12:25.946
It's kind of crazy, right?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.614
It's like this mad generation.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.085
Yeah.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.120
(chuckles)

12:33.153 --> 12:35.555
Kind of tribal, right?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.623
Yeah.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.058
It's world.
(chuckles)

12:38.091 --> 12:40.060
See what I'm saying?
That's the song.
Yeah.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.461
You don't think it's
too edgy for Pepsi?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.897
No, no, no, no.
This is the song!

12:43.931 --> 12:45.432
This is the song.
Oh, yeah.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.434
We can tone down the
edges if we need to.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.436
I got the studio
booked. Come on.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.939
Let's go. Come on.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.740
Well, I don't know if we should
do it now, because...

12:53.773 --> 12:55.809
Yo, why is your mama's
jacket here?
Oh, that's her jacket?

12:55.843 --> 12:57.577
She always leaving stuff
over here. Come on.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.112
And record this dang song.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.249
Acting like a damn fool.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.651
(elevator bell dings)

13:05.685 --> 13:07.487
Anika?

13:07.520 --> 13:08.788
Oh, my God. (chuckles)

13:08.822 --> 13:10.958
Hi, Rhonda.
Hi.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.492
I was just here
getting my favorite smoothie,

13:12.525 --> 13:13.493
the Soul Cleanser.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.295
Are you okay?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.598
You know what?
I feel like my soul

13:18.631 --> 13:19.933
could use some
cleansing, too.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.768
Want me to come?

13:21.801 --> 13:23.770
Okay.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.273
ANIKA: By the way, you look
amazing. You're barely showing.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.008
Well, for a long time,

13:28.041 --> 13:30.110
we didn't want to have
kids, for many reasons,

13:30.143 --> 13:33.780
but when this
happened...

13:33.813 --> 13:35.148
I don't know.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.150
It's honestly the
happiest I've ever been.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.185
Really?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.652
Yeah.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.488
And then there's
this added bonus,

13:41.521 --> 13:44.524
because, turns out, babies are
like kryptonite for Lucious.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.126
Wait, what?
(chuckles)

13:46.159 --> 13:47.961
Well, do you remember
how he was around Lola?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.963
He just completely
melted around her.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.464
Oh, yeah, he did.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.799
It's just
totally bizarre,

13:52.832 --> 13:56.503
because after being completely
iced by him for years,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.439
this pregnancy has
changed everything.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.077
I mean, he'll drop by
my house just to chat.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.078
Really?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.146
Isn't that crazy?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.847
Wow.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.990
(computer rings)
Hey, Mom?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.325
Ma?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.060
Where are we
with your song, Jamal?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.828
I kind of think
I should do some tweaking

14:21.861 --> 14:23.330
to the song myself, you know?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.697
So you working with Jamal?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.699
That's why I can't
get you to help me

14:26.733 --> 14:28.835
with the biggest battle
of my life?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.270
The battle for Dynasty?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.205
It's not what you think, Hakeem.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.241
How come nothing I do
is good enough for you?

14:34.274 --> 14:35.875
What makes you love Jamal
more than me?

14:35.909 --> 14:38.478
Boy, come over here
and sit down.

14:44.952 --> 14:47.087
Look, I'm sorry
I hurt you, okay?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.923
But this deal
is the biggest thing

14:49.957 --> 14:51.724
to ever happen to Jamal.

14:51.758 --> 14:53.793
And if I can
make it happen,

14:53.826 --> 14:55.895
then maybe I can get Jamal
back here with us.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.896
Well, him?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.731
What about me? Us?

14:58.765 --> 15:01.234
You keep working with Jamal,
I'm gonna tell Lucious.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.937
You know what you sound like?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.405
A snitch bitch.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.740
What?
Yeah.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.209
And what, you gonna
snitch to Lucious?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.978
The man who's trying
to take your name?

15:11.011 --> 15:11.979
Really?
I...

15:12.012 --> 15:13.446
Yeah, I thought
your little punk ass

15:13.480 --> 15:15.782
toughened up, but I
guess I was wrong.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.151
All right, I'll hold this one.

15:18.185 --> 15:21.821
But you better get on point, or
I'm gonna air you and Jamal out.

15:21.854 --> 15:22.822
(chuckles)

15:22.855 --> 15:24.624
Okay, you the boss.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.159
Now get your ass in there

15:26.193 --> 15:28.761
so we can get you
ready for this battle.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.430
I'll meet you
in the studio.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.464
Okay.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.336
(sighs)

15:36.369 --> 15:37.837
LUCIOUS:
Same problem, all the way.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.306
Oh, that's crazy.
(groans)

15:39.339 --> 15:41.308
That was crazy.
I'm tired.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.277
Yeah, so, anyway,
I dug up a mountain of dirt

15:44.311 --> 15:45.945
on your friend Jago Locke.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.781
I mean, it was easy.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.951
He airs it all out.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.621
You can't blackmail a man
who flaunts his foulness.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.957
Look, I know you
want this, Pop.

15:57.991 --> 16:01.494
Every bone in my body says
that we should back out now.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.964
No. Dre's got Beats,
Jay has Tidal.

16:04.998 --> 16:07.000
Empire needs Swiftstream.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.701
If you're worried about Mimi,
Pop, we can...

16:08.735 --> 16:11.304
No, no, that bitch needs to
worry about me! Same with Jago!

16:11.338 --> 16:14.207
Same with you two!
Same with Hakeem!

16:14.241 --> 16:16.976
Same with everyone if we don't
start making some moves soon.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.912
I'm sick and tired of being
out here on this damn ledge.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.516
(sighs)

16:23.550 --> 16:25.652
Okay.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.854
Only way we do this
is to get Mimi

16:27.887 --> 16:29.989
to go in with us
to mitigate the risk.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.025
Damn right.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.528
Yeah.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.866
(knocking)

16:43.903 --> 16:45.905
Hey.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.576
Somebody's in a funk.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.678
(laughs)

16:51.711 --> 16:53.546
You never confirmed for tonight.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.348
Sorry, babe.
I just been hella focused.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.051
Oh.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.520
The thing with Freda.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.555
Yeah. Like, Anika,
can I be honest?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.691
Yeah.
I wish
I hadn't done this.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.026
The way Lucious came at me
got me feeling like...

17:07.060 --> 17:09.062
like I'm floating
in outer space or something.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.602
You cannot let him
rule your life, Hakeem.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.939
You need people around you who
are gonna make you feel good.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.741
You know?

17:21.774 --> 17:23.376
Really good.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.777
(chuckles)

17:24.811 --> 17:27.046
Mm, babe.
Oh.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.215
Mmm.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.716
Babe, slow down.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.385
I need to tell
you something,

17:32.419 --> 17:35.622
and I want to make sure you're
in the right mood to hear it.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.724
Can we, like,
talk, no touching?
Hmm?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.226
(laughs)

17:39.259 --> 17:41.060
Really?

17:41.094 --> 17:42.262
No.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.097
Look, here's the thing.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.969
I think I'm in love.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.775
You're... you're in love?

17:55.808 --> 17:57.577
Yeah.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.412
(laughs)

17:59.446 --> 18:01.414
Look, I know it sound crazy.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.483
But I ain't never
feel this way in my life.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.919
But we still homies, right?
I still think you're dope.

18:06.953 --> 18:10.590
Yeah. Of course.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.325
Yes.
Great, great.

18:12.359 --> 18:14.694
So what did you have to tell me?

18:16.696 --> 18:19.098
Nothing. Nothing.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.169
I just wanted to
offer you my support

18:22.202 --> 18:24.437
with the Freda
thing, that's all.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.607
I don't know
wh-what's gonna happen.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.677
I got Cookie
and Laura helping me.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.313
Look, I'm sorry
about everything, Anika.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.316
Don't be.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.032
LUCIOUS:
Hey, what's up, Mal?

18:53.065 --> 18:55.668
So, listen. I've been
thinking about this song,

18:55.702 --> 19:00.006
and, uh... not really sure
which way I want to go with it.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.841
What you talking about?
You don't like my song?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.643
No, I love your song.
It's dope.

19:03.676 --> 19:08.147
But I got this other song
stuck in my head, and...

19:08.181 --> 19:09.882
I don't know,
maybe there's a way we could,

19:09.916 --> 19:11.651
you know, combine the two.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.152
Well, let me hear it.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.288
I mean, if it's good,
we'll use that one. Who cares?

19:15.322 --> 19:18.024
(gentle electronic music
playing)

19:18.057 --> 19:19.559
Nice.

19:23.596 --> 19:24.964
(laughs)

19:24.997 --> 19:26.165
It's cute.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.167
Cute. All right.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.569
Cute in a sexy kind
of cute.
Yeah.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.545
(instruments playing same song)

19:52.392 --> 19:54.160
(music stops)

19:54.193 --> 19:55.395
Yes, Jamal!

19:55.428 --> 19:58.064
Okay, I see why you wanted
to use the studio. (chuckles)

19:58.097 --> 20:00.099
I see you, boo.
You know, I've been thinking

20:00.132 --> 20:02.402
about what the song needs
to take it to the next level.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.203
Good. Me, too.
Yeah, you know
those keys

20:04.237 --> 20:06.873
are angelic, but they're
a little too happy, you feel me?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.408
Put a little edge on that.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.543
Put some stank on it. Run it
back. Let me hear it again.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.778
Mm-hmm, absolutely.
Y'all ready?
Yeah.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.713
JAMAL: All right.
COOKIE:
Go ahead, run it back.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.715
Come on,
what you waiting for?!

20:15.748 --> 20:17.617
Why y'all standing around
looking like you seen a ghost?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.619
What in the hell
is going on here?

20:19.652 --> 20:21.954
Are you serious, Jamal?
LUCIOUS:
You playing with me?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.390
That was her song?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.592
I'm not working with her, man.
COOKIE: Okay, so I left

20:25.625 --> 20:27.927
my spa mani-pedi to come
and deal with this?
Hear me out, please.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.896
LUCIOUS: Is this for real?
JAMAL: Just hear me out.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.063
COOKIE:
I don't even believe this.
Just wait, y'all!

20:31.097 --> 20:33.099
This is exactly why I needed
neutral ground.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.701
Now...

20:34.734 --> 20:37.304
I'm gonna need y'all to fuse
both of your songs together.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.371
I'm sorry, that's
not gonna happen.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.572
That's gonna happen.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.241
Charlie, bring up the mics,
please. Thank you.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.577
Here we go, flutes.
One, two, three, and...

20:44.611 --> 20:45.945
(instruments playing
gentle music)

20:51.451 --> 20:52.419
(music stops)

20:52.452 --> 20:53.486
Mom.
What?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.087
Your flutes are

20:55.121 --> 20:56.789
beautiful,
they're perfect.
I know that.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.991
They are. Your keyboard...

20:59.025 --> 21:01.027
(playing gentle music)

21:03.129 --> 21:04.431
...are beautiful.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.598
Uplifting, even.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.066
"Angelic" is what I said.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.134
Okay, angelic.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.902
But...

21:09.936 --> 21:12.472
Dad's beat and bass line
will bring it all together.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.475
(playing upbeat music)

21:21.648 --> 21:23.816
(music stops)

21:23.850 --> 21:24.817
That's the whole song.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.118
So this is what
I need from y'all.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.821
We are going to merge
these two songs together.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.790
Uh, that is not
gonna happen.
Mom,

21:30.823 --> 21:32.625
these musicians know literally
every single note of this song.

21:32.659 --> 21:33.993
And if y'all can just
work together

21:34.026 --> 21:35.962
for more than two seconds,
I promise you

21:35.995 --> 21:37.296
I can close this thing.
Look, y'all can

21:37.330 --> 21:38.831
play whatever game
y'all want to play,

21:38.865 --> 21:41.668
but at the end of the day,
this is an Empire song.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.035
Empire's paying
for this session.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.036
Actually, no.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.472
I am.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.306
(laughs)

21:47.340 --> 21:48.641
Dad.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.710
Your generation.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.679
Thank you.
All right, come on.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.013
Top.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.715
One, two, three, and...

21:55.748 --> 21:58.017
(upbeat music playing)

22:05.592 --> 22:06.826
(gentle music joins in)

22:06.859 --> 22:08.661
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

22:08.695 --> 22:10.062
Now what the hell
is that, man?!

22:10.096 --> 22:11.831
Oh, my...

22:11.864 --> 22:13.199
That don't work, Jamal. He...

22:13.232 --> 22:15.234
That-that flattened 13th
is killing the bass line.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.736
What?
You got to take that out.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.838
No, I'm not taking
that out, Lucious, no!

22:18.871 --> 22:22.208
Because, first of all, your damn
chorus is too long and scary.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.511
LUCIOUS: Now why don't you
just tell the truth?

22:24.544 --> 22:27.179
You're just trying to save
your dead label by using my son.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.848
That's the truth.
Oh, so now he's your son?

22:28.881 --> 22:31.050
Now he's your son, Lucious?
You hear this?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.719
That's it.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.921
I'm not working with her,
I told you.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.188
Choose.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.090
Yeah, you gonna have to choose.

22:38.124 --> 22:41.027
'Cause, I'm sorry,
this is not the Disney Channel.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.595
We have no happy ending.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.196
Never was a happy ending.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.865
This is an embarrassment
is what this is.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.700
Well, I don't know,

22:47.734 --> 22:49.569
I thought that
maybe y'all could choose

22:49.602 --> 22:51.704
to work together to possibly
do something that would not only

22:51.738 --> 22:53.239
change my life but y'all's, too.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.375
I guess I was wrong,
so I'm done.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.077
Jamal, baby...
No, Ma, I-I'm done.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.448
I'm gonna get him back.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.082
He needs me.
He lives to be me.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.884
He needs me.
And you're gonna
lose Hakeem as well.

23:04.917 --> 23:05.918
I got time
on my side.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.554
And I'm gonna rebuild him.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.922
Don't you bet on it.

23:09.956 --> 23:13.225
Hey... why don't we make a bet?

23:13.259 --> 23:14.561
Say word.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.563
When Hakeem wins...

23:16.596 --> 23:17.564
Hmm.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.231
...I get to release

23:19.265 --> 23:21.300
Jamal's next album
through Lyon Dynasty.

23:23.102 --> 23:26.405
And if your Freda Wack...

23:26.439 --> 23:29.275
happens to win,

23:29.308 --> 23:31.410
you can have Hakeem's.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.480
(chuckles)

23:33.513 --> 23:35.081
Bet.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.649
Bet.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.918
Put your shoes
in my face again.
Shut it.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.893
Okay, this is a battle rap.
Now, we just gonna throw you

23:46.926 --> 23:49.261
some subjects
and you flow, okay? Go.
(hip-hop beat playing)

23:49.295 --> 23:51.063
Phone.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.800
* Phone-- got it in my hand
right now *

23:53.833 --> 23:55.968
* Transferring money
to one of my bank accounts *

23:56.002 --> 23:58.237
* Same time, texting a shorty,
we going out *

23:58.270 --> 24:01.073
* Let her stand next to me
and give her a little shine *

24:01.107 --> 24:03.109
* He ain't even
from the streets, check *

24:03.142 --> 24:05.978
* And he want to be
the boss, check *

24:06.012 --> 24:08.014
* He a little fake mogul,
check *

24:08.047 --> 24:09.949
* And he jealous
of his brother, check *

24:09.982 --> 24:13.085
* I'm laughing at him 'cause
I ain't even worried 'bout him *

24:13.119 --> 24:15.622
* If it ain't Hollywood,
we ain't heard about it *

24:15.655 --> 24:18.758
* Young, rich and flashy,
can't nobody pass me *

24:18.791 --> 24:20.426
* Line 'em up,
I knock 'em down *

24:20.459 --> 24:22.428
* Shorty get at me
(whooping)

24:22.461 --> 24:25.998
* Rolly don't tick,
my whips bet they be nasty *

24:26.032 --> 24:29.001
* I got my own money,
I don't really need daddy *

24:29.035 --> 24:30.603
(crowd cheering)

24:30.637 --> 24:33.305
* Little boy with his nails
done, lookin' like a bitch *

24:33.339 --> 24:35.942
* He never had to struggle,
all he know is being rich *

24:35.975 --> 24:38.110
* Me versus dude is like
a kitten to a bull *

24:38.144 --> 24:40.680
* You know it's hunting season,
one for me and none for you *

24:40.713 --> 24:43.349
* Damn fool, boy, he know
little Freda win it all *

24:43.382 --> 24:45.484
* I'm a bitch, I'm a dog,
but a lion when I roar *

24:45.518 --> 24:48.120
* Check.

24:48.154 --> 24:51.958
JAMAL: I swear, man, the
way Mom and Dad argue,

24:51.991 --> 24:54.126
makes you want to
just say screw it.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.462
Know what I'm saying?
I could submit both songs.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.365
But, man, how you gonna win
with "screw it"?

24:59.398 --> 25:01.000
Don't ask, just take.

25:01.033 --> 25:04.003
You got Dad in you
and you got Mom in you, too.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.673
You got to take the parts
you need from both of them

25:06.706 --> 25:08.207
and fuse them together
for yourself.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.644
Ain't no Mom and Dad.

25:11.678 --> 25:14.413
They're business partners,
not your parents.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.149
It's all on you, Mal.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.051
Oh, CEO talk coming from you.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.020
(chuckles)

25:24.023 --> 25:26.392
So you gonna come see
me and Freda or what?

25:26.425 --> 25:29.495
Tell you this much though,
I want to see a show.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.663
I thought a battle was a show.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.531
Mm-mm. A battle
is a battle.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.233
And that's Freda's game;
you ain't got to try

25:34.266 --> 25:35.668
to follow
that little one-trick fool.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.604
You a MC, but you're
also a performer.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.905
So that's what you do.

25:38.938 --> 25:42.174
You need to work the crowd
and-and hype them up

25:42.208 --> 25:44.043
and give them...
give them real songs

25:44.076 --> 25:45.878
instead of just, you know,
battle raps.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.346
That's how you gonna win.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.850
Make sure you get that damn
chip dust off your mouth, too.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.184
(laughs)

25:52.218 --> 25:54.253
Come on, chief.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.588
* Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

25:55.622 --> 25:57.356
* You're worth more than
a hundred grand. *

25:57.389 --> 26:00.026
Oh, come on,
Mimi's not coming, face it.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.762
Guys, I have to get to the gym.
I mean...

26:02.795 --> 26:04.230
(sharp breaths)

26:04.263 --> 26:06.432
You know, you could always
just put the money up yourself.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.234
Or, you know,

26:08.267 --> 26:11.570
the deal dies, the bank's
analyst rates Empire a sell,

26:11.604 --> 26:13.906
and your stock
tumbles into nothing.

26:13.940 --> 26:17.910
If the deal dies, then
your company doesn't benefit.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.879
Everybody is into streaming.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.447
Okay?
Show me the numbers.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.582
I can tell by your faces
that you're leveraged.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.954
(quietly):
Dre called it.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.389
Mimi got us
flapping in the wind.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.491
You ask me, you bail out now.
It'll be a brutal hit,

26:32.524 --> 26:33.559
but you could
probably survive it.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.628
I don't deal with probablys.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.129
I'm buying Swiftstream.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.565
Lucious, you can
barely afford your half,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.100
let alone the entire amount.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.802
JAGO:
Gentlemen...

26:42.835 --> 26:45.772
I have been advised
to shut up.

26:45.805 --> 26:50.309
Also, I'm tired of waiting,
so I'm gonna go.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.978
I am so very sorry.

26:52.011 --> 26:53.245
Life interfered.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.315
Now, can we wrap this up?

26:56.348 --> 26:59.485
All depends if Mimi has
any more surprises for us.

26:59.518 --> 27:02.655
Lucious, you know that I'm
dealing with personal matters.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.592
Where's that letter of intent?

27:06.625 --> 27:07.626
Here.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.461
Thank you.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.203
I have to get to Positano.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.348
The sooner you sign it,
the sooner we get to work.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.799
Hell with it.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.135
Leverage away.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.038
In six months,
I'm-a own the world.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.314
(woman laughs)
JAMAL: It's gonna be dope,
it's gonna be awesome.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.983
We've been
waiting for it all week.
Yeah.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.317
You're gonna kill it.
I'm very, very excited.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.518
How you feel?
I'm excited.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.687
Anxious, but excited.

28:08.721 --> 28:10.990
COOKIE: Jamal, you told me
you were using my song.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.691
WOMAN: You'll kill it.
Oh, this is my mom.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.493
This is Cookie Lyon.
Oh, hi. Caitlin Peters.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.162
Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure. I'm well.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.930
Uh, do you mind
if I have a word with my son?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.165
Of course, not at all.
Break a leg.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.733
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.368
What is this?
No, no, no, Jamal,

28:22.401 --> 28:23.836
why did you
bring me up in here

28:23.870 --> 28:25.104
when you knew
you invited Lucious, too?

28:25.137 --> 28:26.906
Cookie, have a seat,
please. Sit down.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.208
What the hell
is she doing here?
See, what'd I tell you?

28:29.241 --> 28:30.910
I swear to God, I'm not
doing this with y'all today.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.411
Because he is my son, too.
I'm not. Lucious, Cookie...

28:32.444 --> 28:33.946
You're using my song?
No, you using my song.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.782
Sit down. Now.
I didn't know.
You want the outside?

28:35.815 --> 28:37.349
Oh, yes, thank you.
You can have it.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.085
Thank you, y'all.
I'm so happy.
Thank you so much.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.519
Have a good show, baby.
Yes. All right.
I love you, too, Dad.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.021
We love you. Mama, Daddy

28:42.054 --> 28:43.689
Sorry, pardon me.
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.798

29:32.271 --> 29:33.940

29:37.276 --> 29:40.412

30:09.308 --> 30:11.277

30:11.310 --> 30:14.947
* This world is all mine,
but I'll share with you *

30:14.981 --> 30:16.515
* I'll stay on this star

30:16.548 --> 30:19.451
* And ride it as far as I can

30:19.485 --> 30:22.454
* And I'll never fall,
watch me soar... *

30:22.488 --> 30:24.823
This some BS.
They keep me waiting any longer,

30:24.857 --> 30:27.126
I promise you
I'm gonna shut this place down.
Lucious, Lucious!

30:27.159 --> 30:28.494
I'm gonna shut it down.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.462
The boy got this far on his own.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.865
Look, just don't ruin it
by being you.
JAMAL: I don't even care

30:32.899 --> 30:34.033
at this point though,
'cause I got

30:34.066 --> 30:36.135
something better now.
What?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.536
My album, that's what.

30:37.569 --> 30:39.805
This song that I just did--
it killed.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.174
And it was equal parts
Cookie and Lucious.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.675
So that's what
my album is gonna be.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.144
Both of y'all, together.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.145
Lucious,

30:46.178 --> 30:48.314
Cookie-- equal.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.349
Might call it The Black
and White Album. Who knows?

30:50.382 --> 30:53.219
But regardless, it's gonna
be produced by both of y'all,

30:53.252 --> 30:55.354
and you're gonna enjoy it,
because at the end of the day,

30:55.387 --> 30:56.989
that's what all of us need.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.190
Feel me?

31:00.026 --> 31:01.827
Yeah, the question is:
who's gonna release it?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.662
Oh, well,
that depends on tonight,

31:03.695 --> 31:05.497
doesn't it, Lucious?
It don't depend on nothing.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.034
See, now, we-we made a bet.
Your dumb father made this...

31:08.067 --> 31:09.335

You got it!

37:34.620 --> 37:36.555
(crowd cheering)

37:36.588 --> 37:38.890
CROWD (chanting):
Hakeem! Hakeem! Hakeem!

37:38.924 --> 37:40.025
(chanting continues)

37:44.596 --> 37:45.764
(crowd groaning)

37:48.767 --> 37:50.436
(electrical crackling)

37:52.438 --> 37:55.106
HAKEEM: Hey, y'all,
I got an announcement to make!

37:55.140 --> 37:57.409
I'm dropping my last name.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.812
From here on out,
I go by Hakeem.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.848
(crowd murmuring)

38:04.282 --> 38:06.284
*

38:30.308 --> 38:32.778
FLEX:
All right, who y'all think won?!

38:32.811 --> 38:36.615
CROWD (chanting):
Hakeem! No Lyon!
Hakeem! No Lyon!

38:36.648 --> 38:38.249
(chanting continues)

38:52.564 --> 38:54.833
* Never loved us

38:55.867 --> 38:57.703
* Never loved us...

38:57.736 --> 38:59.137
Hey.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.338
Hey. I'm proud
of you, boy.

39:00.372 --> 39:02.040
Oh, thanks for coming.
Yeah.

39:03.575 --> 39:07.479
You know, all I ever wanted
was to have my boys back.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.181
And even if it's
only for one night,

39:10.215 --> 39:13.051
I am truly happy.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.654
And, Hakeem, you
made it happen.

39:15.687 --> 39:20.225
Yeah, congratulations,
Mr. No Name.

39:20.258 --> 39:23.161
And, Jamal, if you ain't
changed your name already,

39:23.194 --> 39:25.330
your mama might have
a little bit of news.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.165
She gonna tell you
about a bet we made.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.867
(Cookie laughs)

39:28.900 --> 39:30.368
Me and your
father made

39:30.402 --> 39:32.003
a stupid bet.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.406
We both put up
your next album.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.007
Look, look,
look, I know

39:36.041 --> 39:37.743
I didn't have the
right to do it, Hakeem,

39:37.776 --> 39:40.712
but at least you know
I have faith in you. Hmm.

39:43.281 --> 39:44.850
* Never loved us...

39:44.883 --> 39:47.085
Dad.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.188
I say this as someone who
loves you more than anything.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.357
Just let us have this moment.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.359
* Never loved us

39:54.392 --> 39:57.095
* Worst behavior...

39:57.128 --> 39:59.064
Excuse me, sir.
(talking quietly)

39:59.097 --> 40:00.365
* Never loved us

40:00.398 --> 40:01.867
* Worst behavior...

40:01.900 --> 40:03.134
No, don't let her in.

40:03.168 --> 40:06.905
No, no, matter of fact,
hold on. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.373
Hey, Cookie?

40:08.406 --> 40:09.374
COOKIE:
What?

40:09.407 --> 40:11.042
Your sister's here.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.044
Who, Carol?
No, the other one.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.379
CANDACE:
Loretha!

40:14.412 --> 40:15.714
Hey, hey, miss, come on, now.
Loretha!

40:15.747 --> 40:16.882
Loretha!

40:16.915 --> 40:19.217
It's important!
I need to talk to you!

40:19.250 --> 40:22.120
Loretha! It's important, girl!
I need to talk to you!
Who's that?

40:22.153 --> 40:24.255
Candace.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.558
Just... Excuse me.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.927
I said, get...
get your hands off of me!

40:28.960 --> 40:31.897
I told you, I need to
speak with my sister.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.732
Excuse me, fellas.
Thank you.
Yes.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.601
Thank you.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.435
Candace, can you not
show up around here

40:37.469 --> 40:39.104
acting like you at
the Cherry Hill Mall,

40:39.137 --> 40:40.105
embarrassing me?

40:40.138 --> 40:41.640
Oh, stop it.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.309
You know I wouldn't be
here if it wasn't serious.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.911
Oh, okay, well,
then what is it?

40:45.944 --> 40:48.079
Our sister is
on a bender.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.249
And? What she smoked
don't make me choke.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.486
Child, that's what you came
all the way up here to tell me?

40:54.520 --> 40:57.489
If 17 years of prison
taught you anything,

40:57.523 --> 40:59.925
it's definitely how to
dress like a monkey

40:59.958 --> 41:01.426
and talk like a pimp.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.261
It's our sister!
LUCIOUS: Look, hold on.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.130
You know, just when I thought

41:05.163 --> 41:08.767
nothing could make this night
get good, you showed up.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.536
Thank you.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.839
You're welcome, Lucious.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.774
(laughs)

41:15.807 --> 41:18.544
You know, I never did like
your fake ass, Candace.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.948
Yeah, you show up
around here like

41:22.981 --> 41:24.349
you all concerned
about Carol.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.151
I am.
No, you're not.

41:26.184 --> 41:29.788
The first thing you do is get
to talking slick out your mouth.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.456
Real greasy,

41:31.489 --> 41:34.459
looking down your nose at me
like you ain't from

41:34.492 --> 41:37.963
the same hood I'm from,
married to your white man.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.030
And he's rich.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.633
I can't tell
by them cheap-ass shoes.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.334
Okay.
If your bougie ass

41:43.368 --> 41:45.336
called your family
more often,

41:45.370 --> 41:48.540
maybe you'd know Carol ain't
nothing but a scammer.

41:48.574 --> 41:51.176
All she does is run game,
trying to scam

41:51.209 --> 41:52.377
a hot dollar.

41:52.410 --> 41:53.979
The only thing
that's new is that

41:54.012 --> 41:55.513
she got your number
instead of mine.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.016
Welcome back
to the family, Candace.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.985
She left her kids.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.053
What?
Yeah.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.690
She dumped them at
my house with a note,

42:04.723 --> 42:07.993
saying that this was all
Cookie and Jermel's fault.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.861
(sighs)

42:09.895 --> 42:11.529
What have you
done, Loretha?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.067
What have you done?!

42:16.101 --> 42:18.369
Look, come on.
We-we got to go to Philly.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.538
Philly?!
Yes, Philly!

42:20.572 --> 42:22.574
(Hakeem and Laura laugh)

42:24.542 --> 42:27.045
There go your car, babe.
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.517
You sure you don't want me
to come home with you?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.185
Don't make that face.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.688
Yeah, I do, but I want to
make sure we right first.

42:36.722 --> 42:39.224
Okay.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.099
Be safe.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.705
ANIKA:
All right.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.707
Where to?

42:55.741 --> 42:58.276
163rd and Seventh.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.378
Got you.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.748
Buckle up.

43:42.187 --> 43:44.189
Yeah.

43:44.222 --> 43:46.191
