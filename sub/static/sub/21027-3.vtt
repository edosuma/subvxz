WEBVTT

00:07.208 --> 00:09.743
This race
lives in the blood--

00:09.810 --> 00:11.045
blood, blood...

00:11.112 --> 00:13.981
decade to decade...

00:14.048 --> 00:16.050
century to century...

00:17.918 --> 00:20.154
past to future...

00:21.755 --> 00:23.457
father to son...

00:24.992 --> 00:27.828
chasing the same dream,

00:27.895 --> 00:29.763
always chasing.

00:31.399 --> 00:34.535
Le Mans is a car race
like no other.

00:34.602 --> 00:37.638
It's an endurance test
for drivers and cars

00:37.705 --> 00:41.742
that literally takes
24 hours to complete.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.711
55 cars will start,

00:43.777 --> 00:46.780
but many fewer will reach
the checkered flag.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.451
With unprecedented access

00:50.518 --> 00:53.854
to six of the teams
and the event itself,

00:53.921 --> 00:56.390
this is the story of a race

00:56.457 --> 00:59.260
that pushes technology
to the limit

00:59.327 --> 01:01.629
but where the ghosts of the past

01:01.695 --> 01:04.098
are never far from the present.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.416
Well, it's been

01:22.483 --> 01:23.884
a blistering start to the race,

01:23.951 --> 01:25.319
and at the front of the grid,

01:25.386 --> 01:26.730
Timo Bernhard in
the number 17 Porsche

01:26.754 --> 01:29.157
already trying
to stretch his lead.

02:14.635 --> 02:18.339
In third place, reigning
champion Andre Lotterer's Audi

02:18.406 --> 02:20.541
is about eight seconds
off the leader.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.519
We are at the moment, really,

02:31.585 --> 02:33.254
six cars hunting for the lead

02:33.321 --> 02:35.155
or even starting
to hunt for the lead.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.690
We are for sure that two Toyotas

02:36.757 --> 02:39.193
following us at
a very short distance,

02:39.260 --> 02:40.894
so there's really
eight cars in the game.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.899
And down in sixth place,

02:45.966 --> 02:48.336
Sebastien Buemi
in the Toyota number 1.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.640
Sebastien, of course,
comes from a racing family.

02:52.706 --> 02:56.277
His grandfather Georges
raced here 55 years ago.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.303
VoilÃ .

06:35.463 --> 06:37.531
15 minutes into the race.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.800
The 23 Nissan
of Jann Mardenborough

06:39.867 --> 06:41.635
is still stuck in the pits.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.218
Are you hearing me okay?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.087
Yeah, I can hear you.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.937
So Mardenborough

07:17.004 --> 07:18.872
now has the engine
running again.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.436
Rolling forward, forward,
forward, forward, forward,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.105
forward, forward-- need
to get-- second gear is off.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.764
It's the 55th car into the race.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.033
Excellent. So we do
have the full complement.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.070
Jann Mardenborough, not
originally a racing driver,

07:50.137 --> 07:53.106
started on his sofa
in front of the PlayStation.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.648
It's painful for me.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.883
I'm a racer, and, uh,
and to just do this--

08:02.950 --> 08:04.417
just to test
effectively in public

08:04.484 --> 08:05.686
and not be fast is painful.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.987
I couldn't stay on the grid.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.590
To be that far back
is just painful for me.

08:12.225 --> 08:16.597
So I went under a bridge--
like some troll, maybe--

08:16.664 --> 08:18.799
and I phoned
all of my family members

08:18.866 --> 08:21.702
and just said,
"We're doing our best.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.771
We'll see what happens
at the end of the race."

08:26.239 --> 08:28.217
He's not
going to be happy where he is.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.911
But he will have his own
personal challenge now.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.713
- Yeah.
- He'll be looking
for better time.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.591
He'll be looking to try
and better the previous lap

08:34.615 --> 08:35.916
and just claw the time back.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.088
It's a new car, things happen,

08:41.154 --> 08:43.323
so we just gotta
get on with it, really.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.692
It is what it is.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.459
He's not a second place man.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.095
He's not a third place man.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.564
He doesn't like
anything below first.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.569
I am the gamer.
I did come from games.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.105
It's just a cool feeling to have

08:58.171 --> 09:01.809
that you're now recognized
as a professional driver.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.545
This is where I am.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.115
This is where I belong.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.317
I think in a long time,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.319
there'll be a moment
when something will happen,

09:12.385 --> 09:13.854
and it will be magical,

09:13.921 --> 09:15.589
so starting from the back,

09:15.656 --> 09:18.125
if we can get all the way

09:18.191 --> 09:20.127
to the top wherever,

09:20.193 --> 09:22.162
uh, that will be
some story, won't it?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.803
One hour into this race,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.872
and it's Porsche 1 and 2,

09:31.939 --> 09:34.441
but only a second behind
is the number 7 Audi.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.909
Okay, Timo...

09:58.165 --> 09:59.767
What a dog fight this is

09:59.833 --> 10:01.168
between the two teams.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.870
You have to wonder
just how critical

10:02.936 --> 10:04.705
the different technologies
each are using

10:04.772 --> 10:06.139
are going to be.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.244
So Audi have a diesel engine,

10:11.311 --> 10:14.114
turbo charged, powering
the back wheels directly.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.416
The electric motors
drive the front wheels.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.986
It's the same basic technology
as they used last year,

10:19.052 --> 10:20.821
but they've updated the engine

10:20.888 --> 10:22.255
and the hybrid system,

10:22.322 --> 10:24.391
and that's a serious
increase in power.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.927
We have an improved engine

10:26.994 --> 10:29.997
which gets more power
out of less consumption.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.233
We've doubled
the amount of energy

10:33.300 --> 10:36.069
that we can boost
on the front axle
on the electric side.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.976
The Audi is using

10:43.043 --> 10:45.879
2 1/2% less diesel
per lap than last year,

10:45.946 --> 10:47.715
but they're still going quicker.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.783
Amazing efficiency.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.389
Porsche's engine is
also behind the driver,

10:56.456 --> 11:00.193
but they're using a little
4-cylinder petrol engine.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.663
Porsche's major difference comes

11:03.731 --> 11:05.699
from how the electric hybrid

11:05.766 --> 11:07.534
on the front wheels are driven.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.203
Their rivals use
a conventional method

11:10.270 --> 11:13.073
of recovering kinetic
energy under braking,

11:13.140 --> 11:16.109
but Porsche is showcasing
new technology here

11:16.176 --> 11:20.613
that uses thermal energy
from the spent exhaust gases

11:20.680 --> 11:22.549
from its turbo chargers.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.285
This means they can
harvest while accelerating

11:25.352 --> 11:26.820
and gives them
a little advantage

11:26.887 --> 11:28.555
in straight-line speed,

11:28.621 --> 11:32.826
but the Audi R18 is still
quick around the corners.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.072
Teams with deep pockets--
Porsche, Audi, Toyota--

11:45.138 --> 11:46.940
of coursethey're out in front,

11:47.007 --> 11:48.541
but the privately run
Rebellion team,

11:48.608 --> 11:51.344
with a budget maybe
a fifth of the big teams,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.881
are hanging on
to the leaders' coattails,

11:53.947 --> 11:56.716
their two cars in 9th
and 10th position.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.185
It's an amazing achievement,

11:58.251 --> 12:00.320
considering they didn't
even have a car

12:00.387 --> 12:01.488
five weeks ago.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.538
Is it this one? That's
got the oil tank crack.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.107
A privateer team

12:20.173 --> 12:23.743
doesn't have the support
of a manufacturer.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.280
Rebellion are a team

12:27.347 --> 12:29.716
that's born out
of a passion to go racing,

12:29.783 --> 12:31.684
particularly at Le Mans,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.821
and not being afraid
of stepping up

12:33.887 --> 12:36.023
and pitching ourselves
against the guys

12:36.089 --> 12:38.325
that have the huge budgets.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.633
Our reason for existing
is more for going racing

12:46.699 --> 12:48.201
rather than trying to sell cars.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.636
Yeah, he's not a Monaco man.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.038
He has a pick of saloons.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.739
Then he's coming back
a career man.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.541
Yeah.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.943
It started off

12:56.009 --> 12:58.078
as a kind of a hobby
business for my father.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.779
He took early retirement,

12:59.847 --> 13:03.350
and he needed something
to keep him occupied.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.120
It was actually
the day of our wedding

13:07.187 --> 13:08.889
when Bart's dad came to us.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.357
I think it was
the end of the day.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.192
We were in the bar
and it was like,

13:12.259 --> 13:13.894
"Oh, you know,
he'd had a few drinks."

13:16.629 --> 13:18.065
He had an idea.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.133
Does that remind you
of anything?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.811
"We're gonna buy a racing car,

13:21.835 --> 13:23.670
"and we're going to race
at Le Mans,

13:23.736 --> 13:25.272
and we're going to win."

13:27.374 --> 13:29.476
After
a period of time in the UK,

13:29.542 --> 13:31.678
we stepped up into
international motor sport

13:31.744 --> 13:33.813
and started to race in America

13:33.881 --> 13:36.083
and then in the European series,

13:36.149 --> 13:38.451
which was around 2001.

13:41.288 --> 13:45.625
Unfortunately, Dad died in 2010.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.962
He actually had a heart attack
as he was doing karting.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.935
My way of dealing
with that loss

13:55.002 --> 13:58.071
was to throw myself
completely at the sport.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.643
Part of me, I guess,
has had this feeling

14:03.710 --> 14:04.945
of wanting to make sure

14:05.012 --> 14:07.614
that I lived up
to his expectation.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.053
Well,
what a result for Rebellion.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.923
They've been coming here
for a few years now,

14:15.989 --> 14:17.290
and their number 12 car

14:17.357 --> 14:19.226
comes across
in fourth position--

14:19.292 --> 14:21.261
their best-ever finish.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.532
Fourth place
overall in 2014

14:25.598 --> 14:31.371
was really the reward for
that faith and that belief.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.875
That led to us wanting
to change the engine

14:35.943 --> 14:39.012
to try and strive to be
ever more competitive.

14:40.780 --> 14:45.118
Dad was never satisfied with
near enough is good enough.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.055
He might be saying
if he was sat here,

14:48.121 --> 14:49.789
"You might be pleased
with fourth, son,

14:49.856 --> 14:51.959
but that's not
good enough for me."

14:54.661 --> 14:56.263
Our goal, really, is to try

14:56.329 --> 14:58.631
and win the race
as a private team.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.670
Success at Le Mans
is really key each year

15:03.736 --> 15:06.106
for us to keep things alive.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.405
Oh, big trouble

15:33.466 --> 15:35.235
for one of the factory
GT Porsches

15:35.302 --> 15:37.004
at the first chicane

15:37.070 --> 15:38.538
after an incident
with another car.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.640
Looks to be--
it's the 13 Rebellion.

16:03.863 --> 16:09.336
Patrick Pilet is out of that
works 991 specification car.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.105
So the GT car spins out.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.274
The Rebellion is
stuck in the gravel.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.345
That's a big blow
for Bart and the team.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.750
There's an element
of "Oh, shit."

16:25.652 --> 16:26.986
Your first thought

16:27.054 --> 16:29.522
is just to assess
the driver's situation.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.458
Is he okay? Is he hurt?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.369
We're hearing they are going
to try and get that car

16:33.393 --> 16:35.262
at the garage
under its own power,

16:35.328 --> 16:37.064
just trying to keep it
in the race.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.473
The good news is that Alex
Imperatori in the Rebellion

16:46.539 --> 16:49.076
made it out in one piece.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.778
As for the car, well,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.556
they've managed to get
the engine started,

16:53.580 --> 16:55.348
but it won't be
until Bart and the team

16:55.415 --> 16:57.193
have a chance to look at it
and assess the damage

16:57.217 --> 16:58.818
that they know
they can patch it up

16:58.885 --> 17:00.453
and get it back in the race.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.507
Oh, crikey,
we've now got

17:20.573 --> 17:23.676
another three quarters
of the race to run.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.339
A lot of catching up to do
now for that Rebellion.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.874
At the front of the field,

17:54.941 --> 17:56.709
the pace is relentless.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.779
Over 20 laps completed,
no let-up.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.548
Porsche first and second,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.316
just about holding off
the Audis.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.617
It's really a question now

18:04.684 --> 18:06.486
of who's going to blink first.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.125
Oh, my goodness, that's
absolutely fantastic

18:12.192 --> 18:13.826
from Andre Lotterer,

18:13.893 --> 18:16.696
going up the outside of
the black Porsche number 18

18:16.763 --> 18:18.265
and into second place.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.834
And now what a guy!

18:21.901 --> 18:25.472
He's snapping at the heels
of leader Timo Bernhard.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.243
Look at that Audi go!

18:30.310 --> 18:32.445
It looks like he's hit
the after-furnace.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.581
Totally audacious
from Andre Lotterer.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.816
He's snatched it away
from both of the Porsches.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.618
An Audi lead Le Mans.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.524
Okay, it's early in the race.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.626
This is just one hour
into the race, but it's on.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.128
I knew it was going
to start a dogfight.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.366
You think, Okay, how much
do I push actually?

18:53.433 --> 18:56.569
Because I know it's 23--
something hours to go.

18:56.636 --> 19:01.641
Do I really go 100%,
or is it okay to go 99.5?

19:03.710 --> 19:06.479
I don't even think so much
about the competition.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.316
Something can always happen,

19:09.382 --> 19:10.783
a human error

19:10.850 --> 19:13.253
or something on the track
giving you a puncture.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.390
You just have to go
through the race

19:17.457 --> 19:19.826
as fast as you can
without any mistakes.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.291
Big move by Audi.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.959
I wonder what kind of response

19:53.025 --> 19:54.361
we'll see from Toyota.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.969
A long way from the medals--
Jann Mardenborough's Nissan.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.074
In fairness, the 23 car is
making some progress now,

21:15.141 --> 21:16.943
up to 40th position overall,

21:17.009 --> 21:19.446
but they will need
a major setback

21:19.512 --> 21:21.013
from the teams ahead of them

21:21.080 --> 21:23.883
if they've got any hope
of reaching the top 10.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.259
Back at the front,
it's a real tussle

21:33.326 --> 21:35.294
between Porsche and Audi.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.497
This could go down in history

21:37.564 --> 21:39.065
alongside the great battle

21:39.131 --> 21:42.301
between Ford and Ferrari
in the 1960s.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.604
Ferrari's impressive domination

21:44.671 --> 21:46.406
of the 24-hour
since World War II

21:46.473 --> 21:49.776
had attracted the amorous
glances of one Henry Ford,

21:49.842 --> 21:53.212
who set out to buy
the Italian manufacturer

21:53.279 --> 21:57.684
but was personally rebuffed
by its founder Enzo Ferrari.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.387
Not a man to take
a slight lightly,

22:00.453 --> 22:03.623
Ford planned
his revenge in 1966.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.593
He bought the Ford
GT40 to Le Mans

22:06.659 --> 22:09.328
in a bid to overturn
Ferrari's straight run

22:09.396 --> 22:11.798
of five consecutive victories.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.566
Throwing everything at the race

22:13.633 --> 22:15.134
in his determination,

22:15.201 --> 22:16.503
Ferrari simply couldn't match

22:16.569 --> 22:18.638
the pace of Ford's car.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.973
And over the next few years,

22:21.040 --> 22:23.943
the Americans
dominated this course.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.585
But of course the rivalry today

22:32.652 --> 22:34.621
is more sporting than personal,

22:34.687 --> 22:36.264
and here it looks like
we're gonna see Porsche

22:36.288 --> 22:37.657
make a tactical switch

22:37.724 --> 22:40.460
in an attempt to wrestle
back that lead.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.732
There's always a few
butterflies in the stomach,

22:45.798 --> 22:47.534
getting myself psyched up,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.560
but knowing that I need
to be pretty calm as well.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.004
Outside of the cockpit,

22:52.071 --> 22:54.974
yeah, the mind starts to wander.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.375
Probably I'm a bit young.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.886
Still haven't done
enough endurance races

22:57.910 --> 23:00.547
to be calm and just
completely switch off.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.085
We're all nervous.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.821
No one wants to be the one
to make a mistake.

23:21.534 --> 23:22.935
Timo Bernhard out

23:23.002 --> 23:26.506
and Brendon Hartley
into the Porsche 17.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.545
When I take off
down that pit lane,

23:32.612 --> 23:34.681
the adrenaline kicks in.
I'm in my little world,

23:34.747 --> 23:38.451
and it's just pure focus
on the job at hand.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.699
It's gonna be interesting to see

23:52.765 --> 23:54.233
how young Brendon Hartley

23:54.300 --> 23:55.802
tries to wind in the lead

23:55.868 --> 23:57.804
of the champion Lotterer.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.055
Oh, Lotterer
into the pit lane early.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.190
Must be some kind of problem.

24:19.492 --> 24:20.927
He drove over debris

24:20.993 --> 24:22.562
from another car's accident.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.396
That's an extra
tire change for Audi,

24:24.463 --> 24:26.332
an extra minute in the pits.

24:26.398 --> 24:30.002
And, in a race this close,
that's going to cost them.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.806
The 7 Audi came in.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.542
The body language
from the crew--

24:35.608 --> 24:36.909
they know that this is a race

24:36.976 --> 24:38.578
not just out on the track.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.479
Absolute tenths
of secondsto be gained

24:40.547 --> 24:42.582
from every single pit stop.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.584
Strap yourselves in,
boys and girls.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.753
So Porsche,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.320
with Brendon Hartley
at the wheel

24:48.387 --> 24:50.590
in the 17 car
he shares with Mark Webber,

24:50.657 --> 24:52.291
are back in the lead,

24:52.358 --> 24:54.069
And for Audi, they'll
need to see some pressure

24:54.093 --> 24:57.129
applied by their second
car, the number 8.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.067
Oh, my goodness! Horrific!

25:01.133 --> 25:03.269
Problems all over
the place for Audi!

25:10.843 --> 25:14.246
Audi had been hit
by a few problems.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.883
Well, it's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.551
Mark Webber is getting ready

25:18.618 --> 25:20.587
to get into
the Porsche number 17.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.090
Being
in the car at night,

25:24.156 --> 25:26.793
it's an incredible experience
for the driver in the cockpit.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.628
It doesn't happen
in any other race.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.062
Patrick Morisseau:
