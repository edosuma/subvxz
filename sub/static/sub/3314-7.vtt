WEBVTT

00:07.088 --> 00:09.929
"WITH HEARTFELT THANKS FOR
THE LOVELY WEDDING GIFT.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.052
"LOVE, MEL AND JOE."

00:12.053 --> 00:14.934
HEY, HEY, I WOULD APPRECIATE
IT IF YOU WOULD STOP PUTTING

00:14.935 --> 00:16.937
A LITTLE SMILEY FACE IN
THE MIDDLE OF MY "O."

00:18.809 --> 00:20.811
HOW ABOUT A GRUMPY FACE WITH
LITTLE, ANGRY EYEBROWS?

00:21.942 --> 00:23.354
YEAH, LIKE THAT.

00:24.905 --> 00:26.146
OKAY, NOW, HONEY, THIS...

00:26.147 --> 00:28.648
THIS RIGHT HERE IS A FANTASTIC
WEDDING GIFT, ALL RIGHT?

00:28.649 --> 00:29.989
IT'S CALLED A WINE AERATOR.

00:29.990 --> 00:31.151
SEE, WHAT HAPPENS IS
YOU POP THE CORK,

00:31.152 --> 00:32.822
POUR THE WINE THROUGH
THAT BABY, AND BOOM.

00:32.823 --> 00:34.364
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE WINE TO BREATHE.

00:34.365 --> 00:35.535
WAIT, WINE HAS TO BREATHE?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.868
I USUALLY JUST GET IT IN MY MOUTH
RIGHT AWAY SO IT DOESN'T SUFFER.

00:39.660 --> 00:40.920
WHY DON'T WE TRY THIS
THING OUT RIGHT NOW?

00:40.921 --> 00:42.832
RIGHT NOW? IT'S 10:00
IN THE MORNING.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.424
UGH, YOU AND YOUR UPTIGHT RULES:

00:44.425 --> 00:46.967
NO WINE BEFORE 5:00,
NO SEX IN THE CAR.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.551
I WAS DRIVING.

00:51.842 --> 00:54.725
ON A HIGHWAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

00:55.726 --> 00:56.766
FUDDY-DUDDY.

00:56.767 --> 00:57.937
OKAY, NOW THE HARD PART...

00:57.938 --> 00:59.939
THANK YOU NOTES FOR THE
GIFTS WE DON'T LIKE.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.811
THIS IS GONNA TAKE A
BIT OF DIPLOMACY,

01:01.812 --> 01:04.104
A TOUCH OF CREATIVITY,
AND A CRAPLOAD OF LYING.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.145
MM-HMM.

01:05.146 --> 01:07.147
OKAY, THIS IS, UM...

01:07.148 --> 01:09.649
YEP, THIS IS... OH BOY.

01:09.650 --> 01:10.821
OOH.

01:12.153 --> 01:14.454
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD YOU'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO SAY ABOUT THIS, BABY.

01:14.455 --> 01:15.955
OH? WATCH THIS.

01:15.956 --> 01:16.996
"DEAR COUSIN DONNA,

01:16.997 --> 01:21.040
"LEAVE IT TO YOU TO FIND THE MOST
UNIQUE LAMP EITHER OF US HAS EVER SEEN.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.963
"WE'RE FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS
TO PUT IT ON THEIR NIGHTSTAND."

01:23.964 --> 01:25.085
- NOT MINE.
- NOT MINE.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.258
"LOVE, MEL AND JOE."

01:28.259 --> 01:30.510
GOOD ONE. ALL RIGHT, NOW
ON TO THIS MONSTROSITY.

01:30.511 --> 01:32.802
UGH, WHAT, DOES THE GUY WHO MAKES
THE COFFEE LIVE INSIDE OF IT?

01:32.803 --> 01:33.804
(chuckles)

01:34.805 --> 01:36.716
WHAT ARE WE TELLING, AUNT
BUNNY AND UNCLE BERT?

01:36.717 --> 01:38.017
(groans)

01:38.018 --> 01:39.559
SWEET AUNT BUNNY.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.601
SHE WAS TOO SICK TO
MAKE IT TO THE WEDDING.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.644
I KIND OF WISH SHE WAS TOO
SICK TO BUY US THIS THING.

01:44.775 --> 01:46.936
"DEAR AUNT BUNNY AND UNCLE BERT,

01:46.937 --> 01:48.938
"YOUR GIFT BRIGHTENS
OUR MORNINGS.

"ENJOYING A DELIGHTFUL CUP
OF COFFEE FROM THE..."

01:53.654 --> 01:55.945
OH. OH, YEAH. THE IL DUCE.

01:55.946 --> 01:57.657

01:57.658 --> 02:01.001
"THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY IN
CAFFEINATED BEVERAGE PRODUCTION."

02:02.002 --> 02:03.003
- "COFFEE MACHINE."

02:04.004 --> 02:06.207
"YOUR GIFT IS A CENTERPIECE
OF OUR MARITAL KITCHEN."

02:07.208 --> 02:08.588
YOU REALLY WANT IT
IN THE KITCHEN?

02:08.589 --> 02:10.801
ARE YOU KIDDING? I WANT THAT
THING OUT OF HERE, NOW.

02:12.052 --> 02:13.923
YES, MA'AM.

02:13.924 --> 02:15.255
ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S NEXT HERE?

02:15.256 --> 02:17.347
OKAY, THIS IS FROM
YOUR COUSIN JUDY.

02:17.348 --> 02:19.849
YEAH, THIS IS GONNA TAKE ALL
OF YOUR LITERARY PROWESS

02:19.850 --> 02:21.931
TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING
NICE TO SAY ABOUT IT, HONEY.

02:21.932 --> 02:23.184
(grunts)

02:28.108 --> 02:30.150
"HOW DID YOU KNOW WE
DIDN'T HAVE ONE?"

02:33.153 --> 02:34.485

03:04.935 --> 03:06.356
BYE, AUNT BUNNY.

03:06.357 --> 03:07.938
THAT WAS AUNT BUNNY.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.979
NO KIDDING?

03:09.980 --> 03:11.150
SHE'S HAD A COMPLETE RECOVERY

03:11.151 --> 03:13.233
AND HAS DECIDED TO VISIT ALL THE
RELATIVES WHO WISHED HER WELL.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.114
OH, AND I TAKE IT THAT
WE'RE ON THE AUNT BUNNY:

03:15.115 --> 03:17.196
- STILL ALIVE TOUR?
- MM-HMM.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.948
DAY AFTER TOMORROW. SO, JOE...

03:18.949 --> 03:21.281
GO TO THE GARAGE AND DRAG OUT
THAT HUGE, HIDEOUS COFFEE MAKER

03:21.282 --> 03:23.032
AND PUT IT IN A PLACE OF
HONOR IN THE KITCHEN.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.744
THERE IS NO COFFEE
MACHINE IN THE GARAGE.

03:24.745 --> 03:26.586
I RETURNED IT TO THE DEPARTMENT
STORE JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

03:26.587 --> 03:28.538
WHAT? WHOA, I NEVER
SAID RETURN IT.

03:28.539 --> 03:30.089
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
IT OUT OF HERE.

03:30.090 --> 03:32.041
YEAH, OUTTA HERE. LIKE,
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

03:32.042 --> 03:34.334
LIKE SOMEPLACE ELSE, LIKE
IN THE ATTIC OR GARAGE.

03:34.335 --> 03:36.427
HONEY, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID,

03:37.548 --> 03:39.339
WELL, THAT'S CLEARLY
WHAT I MEANT.

03:39.340 --> 03:42.101
YOU KNOW, AUNT BUNNY ONLY RECOVERED
BECAUSE OF THE LOVE OF FAMILY.

03:42.102 --> 03:44.103
IF SHE SHOWS UP, AND WE
DON'T HAVE A COFFEE MAKER,

03:44.104 --> 03:45.805
SHE COULD DIE OF A BROKEN HEART.

03:45.806 --> 03:48.107
THAT ONLY HAPPENS
ON TELENOVELAS.

03:48.108 --> 03:49.309
UH, NO.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.611
AUNT BUNNY IS VERY DELICATE.

03:51.612 --> 03:53.443
OKAY? SHE BROKE HER HIP

03:53.444 --> 03:54.855
YELLING AT ALEX TREBEK.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.449
HEY, YOU GUYS, LOOK AT WHAT MARCO GOT
ME FOR OUR ONE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

03:59.450 --> 04:00.950
THE THIGH GAP CONSPIRACY.

04:00.951 --> 04:02.782
I POINTED IT OUT IN A
STORE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,

04:02.783 --> 04:04.624
AND HE REMEMBERED
AND GOT IT FOR ME.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.206
I RECOGNIZED THE
COLORS ON THE COVER.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.788
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?

04:08.789 --> 04:10.961
HE IS SO SWEET AND LISTENS
TO EVERYTHING I SAY.

04:11.962 --> 04:13.544
YOU'RE NOT HELPING
ME OUT HERE, MARCO.

04:14.965 --> 04:16.876
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'RE
GOING TO THE MOVIES.

04:16.877 --> 04:18.468
LENNOX LIKES QUIRKY
INDEPENDENT FILMS

04:18.469 --> 04:20.760
WHERE ANY NUDITY IS
"INTEG-RAL" TO THE STORYLINE.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.141
AW, IT'S PRONOUNCED "IN-TEGRAL,"

04:22.142 --> 04:24.264
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER,
BECAUSE YOU HEARD ME.

04:26.437 --> 04:29.148
YOU KNOW, SEEING THAT CUTE,
YOUNG COUPLE REMINDS ME...

04:29.149 --> 04:30.561
I NEVER SAID, "RETURN IT."

04:31.562 --> 04:33.943
LISTEN, I'M PRETTY FLUENT IN THE
LANGUAGE OF MEL BURKE, ALL RIGHT?

04:33.944 --> 04:35.315
AND IN MEL BURKE-LISH,

04:35.316 --> 04:37.196
"GET IT OUT OF HERE," MEANS,
"GET RID OF IT COMPLETELY."

04:37.197 --> 04:39.949
IN THE SAME WAY THAT, "IS
THAT A NEW COLOGNE?"

04:39.950 --> 04:41.821
MEANS, "FLUSH IT DOWN
THE TOILET RIGHT NOW."

04:41.822 --> 04:43.953
WHAT? YOU CLEARLY DO
NOT KNOW ME AT ALL.

04:43.954 --> 04:46.616
YET I KNOW YOU SO VERY WELL,
HONEY, AND THAT IS WHY

04:46.617 --> 04:49.579
I TOOK THAT UGLY COFFEE MAKER BACK AND
I GOT US SOMETHING WE BOTH CAN ENJOY.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.001
A ROWING MACHINE.

04:52.252 --> 04:53.963
- A ROWING MACHINE?
- YEAH, A ROWING MACHINE.

04:53.964 --> 04:56.836
BUT HOW AM I GONNA ENJOY A
GIFT I'M NEVER GONNA USE?

04:56.837 --> 04:59.298
WELL, UH... YOU COULD ENJOY

04:59.299 --> 05:01.722
RUNNING YOUR HANDS UP AND DOWN MY
VERY WELL-DEFINED BACK MUSCLES.

05:03.013 --> 05:04.183
COME ON, SMILE.

05:04.184 --> 05:05.725
NO, I'M NOT SMILING.
YOU SCREWED THIS UP.

05:05.726 --> 05:07.807
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE THAT
MISLED HER, ALL RIGHT?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.689
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAD TO
WRITE HER THAT THANK YOU NOTE

05:09.690 --> 05:10.980
SAYING HOW PERFECT HER
WEDDING PRESENT WAS.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.642
LOOK, BLAME IS NOT
GETTING US ANYWHERE.

05:12.643 --> 05:14.605
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST AGREE THAT
IT'S YOUR FAULT AND MOVE ON?

05:15.856 --> 05:16.856
I'M NOT GONNA AGREE TO THAT.

05:16.857 --> 05:18.398
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WILL
DO THOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

05:18.399 --> 05:20.069
I WILL GET US A NEW
ESPRESSO MAKER.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.821
TOMORROW. IT'LL
HAPPEN, I PROMISE.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.743
THANK YOU.

05:23.744 --> 05:26.446
SO ARE THOSE BACK MUSCLES OF
YOURS STILL OPEN FOR BUSINESS?

05:26.447 --> 05:27.538
THEY NEVER CLOSE, BABE.

05:30.751 --> 05:32.122
- MORNING, JOE.
- MORNING.

05:33.123 --> 05:35.004
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ESPRESSO MACHINES?

05:35.005 --> 05:36.456
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS ALREADY
GOT ONE AS A GIFT.

05:36.457 --> 05:38.087
YEAH, WELL, YOUR AUNT MEL
TOLD ME TO GET RID OF IT,

05:38.088 --> 05:40.169
WHICH TURNS OUT IS
SECRET WIFE CODE FOR,

05:40.170 --> 05:42.341
"WHATEVER I DO IS WRONG,"

05:42.342 --> 05:44.924
AND NOW I HAVE TO REPLACE IT BEFORE
THIS AUNT BUNNY PERSON SHOWS UP HERE.

05:44.925 --> 05:46.175
HMM.

05:46.176 --> 05:47.557
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

05:47.558 --> 05:49.889
YOU AND AUNT MEL ARE HAVING TROUBLE
IN THE COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT,

05:49.890 --> 05:52.021
WHEREAS YOUR NEPHEW AND I
ARE GETTING ALONG GREAT.

05:52.022 --> 05:56.106
HUH. AND SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM
THOUGHT THAT WE WERE A BAD MATCH.

05:57.818 --> 06:01.482
DO ALL THE WOMEN IN THIS FAMILY HAVE
A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO GLOAT?

06:02.613 --> 06:03.783
IT'S NOT GLOATING.

06:03.784 --> 06:06.826
WE'RE JUST RIGHT A LOT, AND
IT'S HARD NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

06:06.827 --> 06:07.827
OH! SCORE!

06:07.828 --> 06:10.831
YES, THEY GOT SIX OF THESE COFFEE
MAKERS AT BED, BATH, AND BURRITOS.

06:12.292 --> 06:14.835
THAT'S A HOUSEWARES/MEXICAN
FOOD PLACE.

06:16.797 --> 06:18.087
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS
GOING OUT WITH ZANDER,

06:18.088 --> 06:21.380
IT WAS JUST... HIS CONSTANT
OVER-ANALYZING OF EVERY LITTLE MOMENT,

06:21.381 --> 06:23.262
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

06:23.263 --> 06:25.425
I THINK WHAT MAKES MY
RELATIONSHIP WITH MARCO SO GREAT

06:25.426 --> 06:27.307
IS THAT HE'S JUST
TOTALLY SIMPLE.

06:30.270 --> 06:31.772
I MEAN UNCOMPLICATED.

06:32.933 --> 06:34.774
MUST FEEL GREAT TO BE, LIKE,

06:34.775 --> 06:36.186
THE BEST COUPLE IN
THE WHOLE WORLD.

06:38.318 --> 06:39.779
- IT DOES.
- HMM.

06:39.780 --> 06:40.820
(phone beeps)

06:40.821 --> 06:42.112
(mutters) LET'S SEE.

06:43.864 --> 06:45.445
OH, IT'S A TEXT
FROM YOUR AUNT MEL.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.697
"UPDATE ON ESPRESSO MACHINE?"

06:47.698 --> 06:49.789
FOUR QUESTION MARKS. YEAH,
THAT'S HOW MUCH SHE TRUSTS ME.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.290
HMM? (chuckles)

06:51.291 --> 06:54.744
OH. "IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

06:54.745 --> 06:56.917
"RELAX."

06:57.798 --> 07:00.541
I COULD HAVE JUST USED ALL CAPS RIGHT
THERE, BUT I DIDN'T. I TOOK THE HIGH ROAD.

07:02.843 --> 07:04.844
HEY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
ANOTHER BAG OF MARSHMALLOWS

07:04.845 --> 07:06.596
IF YOU WANNA MAKE
SOME MORE S'MORES.

07:06.597 --> 07:07.807
(laughs) THAT'S FUNNY.

07:07.808 --> 07:11.351
DO YOU THINK MR. S'MORE KNEW HIS
DESSERT KINDA SOUNDS LIKE "SOME MORE"?

07:12.893 --> 07:14.645
YOU ARE LIKE A
PUPPY ON TWO LEGS.

07:16.817 --> 07:18.609
(phone ringing)

07:20.020 --> 07:21.981
MARCO, IT'S YOUR
BOSS, THORNDYKE.

07:21.982 --> 07:23.023
Marco: I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

07:25.776 --> 07:28.238
HELLO, MARCO SORRENTINO'S
OFFICE, HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

07:29.870 --> 07:33.202
OH, WELL, YES, MR. WELLES, I'D
BE GLAD TO TAKE A MESSAGE.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.334
DOES MARCO WANT THE MORNING
FLIGHT OR THE AFTERNOON FLIGHT?

07:35.335 --> 07:36.787
TO WHERE?

07:37.918 --> 07:39.378
- TOKYO?
- I GOT THAT.

07:39.379 --> 07:41.170
(clears throat)

07:41.171 --> 07:43.342
HEY, THORNY, LISTEN, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.

07:43.343 --> 07:44.845
OKAY, GREAT.

07:48.889 --> 07:52.091
THAT'S AMAZING. YOU'RE
GOING ON A TRIP TO TOKYO?

07:52.092 --> 07:54.144
YEAH. IT'S IN JAPAN.

07:56.016 --> 07:58.769
THORNDYKE GOT INVITED TO DO AN ART
INSTALLATION AND HE'S TAKING ME.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.940
WELL, I'M JEALOUS.

08:00.941 --> 08:03.103
I HOPE YOU GET SOME FREE TIME WHILE
YOU'RE THERE TO DO SOME SIGHTSEEING.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.158
SO, HOW LONG ARE
YOU GONNA BE GONE?

08:09.159 --> 08:11.871
WELL, THAT DEPENDS ON
WHICH FLIGHT I TAKE.

08:11.872 --> 08:14.243
IF I TAKE THE AFTERNOON
FLIGHT, IT'LL BE SIX MONTHS,

08:14.244 --> 08:15.575
BUT IF I TAKE THE
MORNING FLIGHT,

08:15.576 --> 08:17.287
IT'LL BE SLIGHTLY
MORE THAN SIX MONTHS.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.213
HEY, SWEETIE.

08:24.214 --> 08:25.925
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

08:25.926 --> 08:28.798
REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU HOW GREAT THE
COMMUNICATION WAS WITH ME AND MARCO?

08:28.799 --> 08:30.840
WELL, IT TURNS OUT IT SUCKS.

08:30.841 --> 08:33.433
WHOA, I WAS JUST ASKING TO BE POLITE,
BUT YOU'RE REALLY ANSWERING.

08:34.434 --> 08:36.806
WELL, IT TURNS OUT MARCO
WASN'T TELLING ME ANYTHING.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.938
HE IS GOING TO JAPAN
FOR SIX MONTHS,

08:38.939 --> 08:42.562
AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE MENTIONED IT AT ALL,
EXCEPT I ANSWERED HIS PHONE AND FOUND OUT.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.604
OH, HONEY, THAT'S THE ONLY
WAY YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING.

08:44.605 --> 08:46.105
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU HAVE
HIS EMAIL PASSWORD.

08:46.106 --> 08:48.068
THEN... (chuckles) WHOA, NELLY.

08:50.741 --> 08:52.782
AND THE PROBLEM IS...

08:52.783 --> 08:55.705
I DON'T WANT TO BREAK UP. THINGS
HAVE BEEN GOING REALLY WELL.

08:55.706 --> 08:57.827
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST ENJOY
THE TIME BEFORE HE LEAVES.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.869
TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT HIS TRIP.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.961
YOU MEAN LIVE IN DENIAL?

09:01.962 --> 09:03.123
ABSOLUTELY.

09:04.124 --> 09:05.925
THERE'S A REASON SO MANY
PEOPLE LIVE IN DENIAL.

09:05.926 --> 09:07.877
THE VIEWS ARE FANTASTIC.

09:07.878 --> 09:11.131
YOU KNOW, I HAVE HAD SOME REALLY GOOD
TIMES WITH MEN WHEN I WASN'T THINKING.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.135
SO, WHERE IS IT?
WHERE'S THE MACHINE?

09:16.136 --> 09:17.677
OH, IT'S RIGHT HERE, BABY.

09:17.678 --> 09:21.021
AND IT'S GOT TWO... FOUR... 600
HORSEPOWER OF LEAN MUSCLE.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.183
CAN YOU GET YOUR HEAD
OUT OF YOUR ABS?

09:24.184 --> 09:26.235
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE
ESPRESSO MACHINE.

09:26.236 --> 09:27.947
YOU TEXTED ME, "IT'S
TAKEN CARE OF."

09:27.948 --> 09:29.899
YES, YES, AND IT IS
BEING TAKEN CARE OF.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.531
LOOK, IT'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S RIGHT
HERE ON MY ACTION ITEMS LIST.

09:32.532 --> 09:33.863
THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF
DOING SOMETHING?

09:33.864 --> 09:36.325
IF PUTTING SOMETHING ON YOUR TO-DO
LIST MEANS IT'S ALREADY DONE,

09:36.326 --> 09:38.157
THEN I'VE ALREADY
ORGANIZED MY SHOE CLOSET

09:38.158 --> 09:40.701
AND LEARNED THE FINE ART OF
JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGEMENT.

09:41.792 --> 09:42.912
HONEY, NO, NO. LISTEN.

09:42.913 --> 09:44.543
TO-DO LIST ITEMS CAN BE
FORGOTTEN, ALL RIGHT?

09:44.544 --> 09:46.295
ACTION ITEMS, THEY GET DONE.

09:46.296 --> 09:48.207
SO WHERE'S THE ESPRESSO MACHINE?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.469
I DIDN'T GET IT DONE YET.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.921
- I'LL DO IT TOMORROW.
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

09:51.922 --> 09:54.013
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO GO DOWN
TO THE STORE AND GET ONE MYSELF.

09:54.014 --> 09:55.715
YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

09:55.716 --> 09:56.886
JOE, UM...

09:56.887 --> 09:59.138
DID YOU SAY THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO GET ONE THIS MORNING

09:59.139 --> 10:00.930
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR?

10:00.931 --> 10:02.852
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT, HONEY.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.774
LISTEN, BEFORE YOU RUN
DOWN THERE, ALL RIGHT,

10:04.775 --> 10:07.817
I CHECKED ONLINE TO MAKE SURE THE STORE HAD
SOME, AND I'M GONNA CHECK AGAIN RIGHT NOW.

10:07.818 --> 10:09.859
ALL RIGHT, THERE WERE
SIX THIS MORNING,

10:09.860 --> 10:11.610
AND THERE ARE STILL...

10:11.611 --> 10:12.822
ONE.

10:12.823 --> 10:14.655
THEY SOLD FIVE OF THESE
THINGS IN A DAY?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.286
HAVE PEOPLE NEVER
HEARD OF STARBUCKS?

10:17.287 --> 10:19.618
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS SITUATION

10:19.619 --> 10:21.661
IF SOMEONE HAD ACTUALLY BOUGHT
ONE WHEN THEY SAID THEY DID.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.452
THERE WERE SIX THIS MORNING!

10:23.453 --> 10:25.085
SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

10:29.209 --> 10:32.251
YOU KNOW, WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT LAST
MACHINE IF SOMEONE WASN'T TOO CHICKEN.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.804
OH, EXCUSE ME. I WASN'T WILLING
TO KNOCK OVER AN OLD LADY

10:34.805 --> 10:35.965
JUST TO GRAB AN
UGLY COFFEE MAKER.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.017
YEP, LIKE I SAID.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.519
(clucking)

10:41.021 --> 10:44.104
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY
SOLD SIX OF THOSE THINGS IN ONE DAY?

10:45.525 --> 10:46.565
ME!

10:46.566 --> 10:47.728
ME! THAT'S WHO!

10:51.111 --> 10:52.151
SO THANKS, JOE.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.823
NOW WE DON'T HAVE AN ESPRESSO
MACHINE FOR AUNT BUNNY.

10:53.824 --> 10:55.945
YOU REALLY THINK THIS
IS 100% MY FAULT?

10:55.946 --> 10:59.909
YES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE 100 IS AS
HIGH AS THE BLAME-O-METER CAN GO.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.871
OH, SINCE YOU'RE FIRING
UP THE BLAME-O-METER,

11:01.872 --> 11:03.913
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT YOU
WANTED ME TO GET RID OF IT

11:03.914 --> 11:04.914
WHEN YOU SAID, "GET
IT OUT OF HERE"?

11:04.915 --> 11:06.495
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

11:06.496 --> 11:08.878
I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL AUNT BUNNY
THE HORRIBLE TRUTH, YOU KNOW?

11:08.879 --> 11:10.289
EVEN IF SHE HATES ME FOR
THE REST OF HER LIFE.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.501
THE ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT
COULD BE A VERY SHORT TIME,

11:12.502 --> 11:13.673
BECAUSE THIS COULD KILL HER!

11:16.346 --> 11:17.888
(theme music on TV)

11:20.300 --> 11:21.851
TOLD YOU YOU'D LOVE ROCKY.

11:21.852 --> 11:24.804
OH, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL,
SIMPLE STORY.

11:24.805 --> 11:26.646
ROCKY AND ADRIAN
LIVED IN THE MOMENT,

11:27.607 --> 11:28.808
JUST LIKE US.

11:28.809 --> 11:30.900
YEAH, WE'RE JUST
LIVING IN THE PRESENT.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.022
WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT THE
FACT THAT MERE DAYS FROM NOW

11:33.023 --> 11:35.024
- I'M GONNA BE GETTING ON A PLANE TO GO...
- WHA-A-A.

11:35.025 --> 11:37.987
NO, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT
ANYTHING BEYOND TODAY.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.870
SO, TELL ME WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.702
I BOUGHT A NEW
SUITCASE FOR MY...

11:44.584 --> 11:46.035
UM...

11:46.036 --> 11:47.246
I CALLED MY MOM.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.418
IT WAS FUNNY, SHE WANTED TO KNOW
IF I NEEDED TO HAVE ANY SHOTS

11:49.419 --> 11:50.791
BEFORE I GO...

11:52.292 --> 11:54.213
THIS IS HARD.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.096
- IT'S LIKE THERE'S THIS THING...
- AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?

11:57.097 --> 12:00.009
NO, NO, NO. SOMETHING REALLY BIG
AND IMPORTANT IN FRONT OF US,

12:00.010 --> 12:01.391
AND WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

12:02.803 --> 12:04.894
MARCO, WE AGREED, OKAY?

12:04.895 --> 12:08.268
WE'RE BLOCKING ALL OF THAT OUT AND
FOCUSING ENTIRELY ON THE NOW.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.981
OKAY. WELL...

12:13.023 --> 12:14.984
DID YOU KNOW THERE
WERE FIVE MORE ROCKYs?

12:14.985 --> 12:18.818
INTERESTING FACT, ROCKY III IS THE FIRST
TIME MR. T SAYS, "I PITY THE FOOL."

12:18.819 --> 12:21.360
OKAY, STOP. I CAN'T
NOT TALK ABOUT THIS.

12:21.361 --> 12:23.742
I CAN'T LIVE IN DENIAL.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.166
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TRIP, OKAY?
I WANT TO HEAR EVERYTHING.

12:27.167 --> 12:28.208
OKAY. (clears throat)

12:29.209 --> 12:31.921
THORNDYKE WAS HIRED TO DO A
MAJOR INSTALLATION IN TOKYO,

12:31.922 --> 12:33.793
AND HE REALIZED HE
WOULD NEED A WELDER.

12:33.794 --> 12:36.505
ZANDER IS HIS ASSISTANT, SO
HE LOOKED FOR A WELDER THERE,

12:36.506 --> 12:39.048
BUT HE SAID THAT HE
COULDN'T FIND ANYONE LOCAL,

12:39.049 --> 12:40.931
SO THORNDYKE ASKED
ME TO GO WITH HIM.

12:43.343 --> 12:45.434
WAIT A MINUTE. SO
YOU'RE TELLING ME

12:45.435 --> 12:48.687
THAT IN ALL OF JAPAN, ZANDER
COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE WELDER?

12:48.688 --> 12:50.270
SURPRISED ME TOO.

12:51.942 --> 12:53.562
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS, RIGHT?

12:53.563 --> 12:55.024
YEAH.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.357
JAPAN'S GOT A SERIOUS
WELDER SHORTAGE.

13:01.661 --> 13:02.741
WELL, THAT'S IT.

13:02.742 --> 13:04.994
AUNT BUNNY AND UNCLE BERT ARE
GETTING OFF THE FREEWAY RIGHT NOW,

13:04.995 --> 13:06.866
AND THEY WILL BE
HERE IN 20 MINUTES.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.247
OH, SCORE! OOH!

13:08.248 --> 13:10.830
I FOUND THE EXACT SAME COFFEE MAKER
RIGHT HERE ON EMMY LOU'S LIST.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.963
WHAT? NO, NO, NO. EMMY LOU'S
LIST IS NOT RELIABLE.

13:13.964 --> 13:16.876
THAT'S THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE YOU FIND A
FREE APARTMENT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO SNUGGLE.

13:16.877 --> 13:18.127
I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS, HONEY.

13:18.128 --> 13:19.548
LOOK, YOU STALL BUNNY AND BERT,

13:19.549 --> 13:21.590
I'LL BE BACK, HALF HOUR
TOPS, WITH A COFFEE MACHINE

13:21.591 --> 13:23.052
THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE
ONE THAT THEY GAVE US.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.924
NO, JOE, I'M JUST GONNA
TELL THEM THE TRUTH, OKAY?

13:24.925 --> 13:25.926
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.308
RIGHT.

13:29.850 --> 13:30.890
OKAY.

13:30.891 --> 13:32.641
I UNDERSTAND HOW
THIS WORKS NOW, SEE.

13:32.642 --> 13:34.733
WHEN YOU SAY, "DON'T DO IT,"
WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN IS,

13:34.734 --> 13:35.895
"YOU BETTER GET IT DONE."

13:35.896 --> 13:37.526
NO, JOE, REALLY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

13:37.527 --> 13:39.318
I UNDERSTAND.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.360
I LOVE YOU TOO.

13:44.865 --> 13:47.206
HEY, LEN, I GOT YOUR TEXT. I
GOT HERE AS FAST AS I COULD.

13:47.207 --> 13:48.827
WHAT DO YOU NEED THE
DRAWINGS FOR RIGHT NOW?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.539
OH, I JUST NEED THEM.

13:50.540 --> 13:51.912
UH-HUH...

13:52.913 --> 13:58.337
UH-HUH... OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE ONE
QUESTION ABOUT THIS LAST PANEL HERE.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.550
- THERE WERE NO OTHER WELDERS IN JAPAN?
- OW!

14:01.551 --> 14:03.262
YOU COULDN'T FIND ONE?

14:03.263 --> 14:04.763
OKAY, I TRIED.

14:04.764 --> 14:05.804
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

14:05.805 --> 14:07.846
YOU ENGINEERED THIS WHOLE THING
TO GET MARCO OUT OF THE PICTURE.

14:07.847 --> 14:11.020
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO WIN ME BACK,
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

14:11.021 --> 14:12.972
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:12.973 --> 14:14.603
I ENGINEERED THIS WHOLE THING.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.065
THERE'S NO ART INSTALLATION.

14:16.066 --> 14:17.276
THERE ARE NO LECTURES.

14:17.277 --> 14:19.148
OH, AND THORNDYKE WELLES?
I MADE HIM UP, TOO.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.280
YEAH, YEAH. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:21.281 --> 14:22.821
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT
IT, THERE IS NO JAPAN.

14:22.822 --> 14:24.984
YEAH, YEAH. IN FACT,

14:24.985 --> 14:26.075
THERE'S NO TOLEDO.

14:26.076 --> 14:28.787
HEY, EVERYBODY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE GOT HER.

14:28.788 --> 14:29.869
WE'RE DONE.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.412
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

14:33.413 --> 14:34.793
YOU FORCED MARCO TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

14:34.794 --> 14:36.625
I DIDN'T FORCE ANYONE
TO DO ANYTHING.

14:36.626 --> 14:37.997
OKAY? MARCO HAD A CHOICE...

14:37.998 --> 14:40.669
YOU OR JAPAN... AND YOU
CAN SEE WHAT HE CHOSE,

14:40.670 --> 14:42.461
WITHOUT EVEN PAUSING TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

14:42.462 --> 14:45.844
SO NOW, IF YOU'RE DONE
BEATING ME WITH MY ART...

14:45.845 --> 14:47.137
I'LL TAKE MY LEAVE.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.312
DON'T YOU TRY TO CONFUSE
ME WITH YOUR FACTS!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.016
(doorbell rings)

14:58.688 --> 15:00.779
(gasps) AUNT BUNNY! UNCLE BERT!

15:00.780 --> 15:03.323
DARLING, DARLING.

15:04.864 --> 15:06.235
OH DEAR.

15:06.236 --> 15:07.826
AWW.

15:07.827 --> 15:10.369
WE ARE SO THRILLED
THAT YOU RECOVERED.

15:10.370 --> 15:11.830
WELL, IT WAS TOUCH AND GO,

15:11.831 --> 15:14.703
BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS AS
LONG AS NOTHING UPSETS ME

15:14.704 --> 15:16.455
I'M FINE.

15:16.456 --> 15:17.746
WHERE'S JOE?

15:17.747 --> 15:20.749
OH, HE'S OUT CROSSING
THINGS OFF HIS ACTION LIST.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.881
WHY DON'T WE HAVE A
SEAT AND CATCH UP.

15:22.882 --> 15:24.003
YES, LET'S CATCH UP

15:24.004 --> 15:25.884
OVER A DELICIOUS
CUP OF ESPRESSO.

15:25.885 --> 15:27.466
WHICH I WILL WATCH YOU MAKE.

15:27.467 --> 15:28.927
NO, NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.389
AUNT BUNNY, BEFORE YOU
GO IN THE KITCHEN,

15:30.390 --> 15:31.890
UM...

15:31.891 --> 15:33.392
THERE'S SOMETHING I
HAVE TO TELL YOU.

15:33.393 --> 15:34.813
UM...

15:34.814 --> 15:37.606
YOU SENT US THE MOST
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL GIFT,

15:37.607 --> 15:39.768
AND IT WAS SO, SO THOUGHTFUL,

15:39.769 --> 15:41.981
BUT THE THING IS ABOUT
THE ESPRESSO MACHINE,

15:41.982 --> 15:43.232
UM... (clears throat)

15:43.233 --> 15:44.823
IT'S JUST SO BIG

15:44.824 --> 15:46.865
AND SHINY

15:46.866 --> 15:49.068
AND BIG.

15:49.069 --> 15:50.949
(groans)

15:50.950 --> 15:53.872
- YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.
- NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:53.873 --> 15:55.874
WE LOVED IT. WE LOVED IT.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.288
UM, BUT THE TRUTH IS, UM...

15:59.419 --> 16:01.460
UH, IT WAS STOLEN

16:01.461 --> 16:05.884
BY TWO BIG, STRONG MEN, YOU
KNOW, WITH EXCELLENT TASTE.

16:05.885 --> 16:07.466
(door opens)

16:07.467 --> 16:11.261
WHO WANTS A FRESH CUP OF COFFEE, COURTESY OF
BUNNY AND BERT'S MOST PERFECT WEDDING PRESENT?

16:15.095 --> 16:16.805
BUT I THOUGHT THE
MACHINE WAS GONE.

16:16.806 --> 16:19.558
I... I CAN CLARIFY, AUNT BUNNY.

16:19.559 --> 16:22.361
YOU SEE, JOE, I WAS JUST TELLING
THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

16:22.362 --> 16:23.602
TO THE COFFEE MAKER.

16:23.603 --> 16:25.814
- YOU SEE, I WAS TELLING...
- OH, OKAY, OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LOOK...

16:25.815 --> 16:26.905
GUILTY. IT'S MY FAULT.

16:26.906 --> 16:28.908
- NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT...
- HONEY, PLEASE. LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL:

16:30.240 --> 16:32.871
MEL WANTED TO KEEP
IT, I MISUNDERSTOOD,

16:32.872 --> 16:33.953
AND I TOOK IT BACK.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.957
BUT MEL SAID BURGLARS TOOK IT.

16:39.829 --> 16:41.251
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.754
I TOOK IT BACK, AND
BURGLARS STOLE IT.

16:49.389 --> 16:50.550
FROM THE STORE.

16:53.803 --> 16:55.635
I DON'T KNOW HOW I
KNOW THAT, BUT I DO.

16:57.937 --> 16:59.308
WHY DO I NOT BELIEVE THIS?

16:59.309 --> 17:01.600
UM, LOOK, AUNT
BUNNY, UNCLE BERT,

17:01.601 --> 17:05.104
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE
ESPRESSO MACHINE IS, UM...

17:05.105 --> 17:07.606
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A
MISUNDERSTANDING AND...

17:07.607 --> 17:09.738
WE RETURNED IT TO THE STORE.

17:09.739 --> 17:11.450
- OH.
- IT WASN'T STOLEN AT ALL.

17:11.451 --> 17:14.203
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NEWLYWEDS, GUYS.

17:14.204 --> 17:16.075
WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT THIS
WHOLE COMMUNICATION THING.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.617
YEAH, BUT CHECK BACK WITH US WHEN
WE HAVE 40 YEARS LIKE YOU GUYS.

17:18.618 --> 17:20.750
- (laughing)
- WHAT'D I SAY? I TOLD YOU THEY'D HATE IT.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.792
YOU NEVER SAID THAT.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.544
I NEVER STOPPED SAYING THAT.
YOU DON'T LISTEN.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.167
MAYBE I'D LISTEN IF YOU
DIDN'T YELL SO MUCH.

17:28.168 --> 17:29.878
40 YEARS OF THIS.

17:29.879 --> 17:31.880
NO WONDER MY HEART
NEARLY GAVE OUT.

17:31.881 --> 17:35.635
IF YOUR HEART WAS AS STRONG AS
YOUR YAPPER, IT'D NEVER GIVE OUT.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.477
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S NOT FIGHT.

17:38.478 --> 17:41.060
- OH, THIS ISN'T FIGHTING.
- THIS IS HER BEING NICE.

17:42.142 --> 17:46.105
OKAY, MAYBE A CUP OF ESPRESSO FROM
THE MACHINE THAT JOE JUST PICKED UP

17:46.106 --> 17:48.857
WOULD HELP MAKE THINGS A
LITTLE LESS UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:48.858 --> 17:50.690
- I'LL JUST GO MAKE IT.
- YEP, I'M GONNA HELP.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.612
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
MAKING PEOPLE HATE US.

17:53.613 --> 17:55.494
I CAN'T TAKE YOU
ANYWHERE ANYMORE.

17:55.495 --> 17:57.576
YOU CAN'T TAKE ME ANYWHERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE CHEAP.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.867
- I'M CHEAP?
- YES.

17:58.868 --> 18:00.078
WHEN I HAD MY CATARACT SURGERY,

18:00.079 --> 18:03.203
YOU ASKED HOW MUCH IT WOULD
BE WITHOUT ANESTHESIA.

18:04.204 --> 18:05.874
GO, HONEY. GO, GO, GO.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.836
- (bickering)
- OH MY GOODNESS.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.508
OH, YEAH. I DON'T WANT
THAT TO BE US IN 40 YEARS.

18:09.509 --> 18:11.880
I KNOW, WE NEED TO FIX THIS
COMMUNICATION THING RIGHT NOW.

18:11.881 --> 18:13.802
OKAY, LOOK.

18:13.803 --> 18:15.134
YOU WERE RIGHT.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.266
I REALLY DID WANT YOU TO GET
RID OF THAT ESPRESSO MACHINE.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.679
I WANTED YOU TO PUT IT IN A BASKET
AND LEAVE IT AT THE FIRE STATION.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.101
HEARING YOU SAY THAT MEANS
A LOT TO ME, SWEETIE.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.984
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I
HAVE A CONFESSION TOO.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.107
I DON'T HAVE AN
ACTION ITEMS LIST.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.612
STARTING ONE WAS ON MY TO-DO LIST,
BUT I NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT.

18:33.943 --> 18:36.575
OKAY, LOOK, FROM HERE ON OUT, WE
ARE GONNA COMMUNICATE CLEARLY,

18:36.576 --> 18:38.537
SPECIFICALLY, AND HONESTLY.

18:38.538 --> 18:39.998
- I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
- OKAY.

18:39.999 --> 18:41.580
- WELL, LET'S PRACTICE.
- OKAY.

18:41.581 --> 18:42.741
- KISS ME.
- WHERE?

18:42.742 --> 18:43.792
- ON THE MOUTH.
- WHEN?

18:43.793 --> 18:44.794
NOW.

18:45.795 --> 18:47.046
- FOR HOW LONG?
- OH, COME ON.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.091
I GOT YOU THIS FOR YOUR TRIP.
IT'S A JAPANESE PHRASE BOOK.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.424
THANKS.

18:55.715 --> 18:56.805
YOU KNOW...

18:56.806 --> 18:59.968
I THOUGHT I WAS ALWAYS GONNA
BE A MOOK WHO WORKED ON CARS,

18:59.969 --> 19:03.101
NOW I'M COLLABORATING WITH A FAMOUS
ARTIST AND GETTING TO SEE THE WORLD,

19:03.102 --> 19:05.264
AND IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

19:05.265 --> 19:06.815
WELL, DON'T GIVE
ME ALL THE CREDIT.

19:06.816 --> 19:08.437
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO CHOSE JAPAN.

19:08.438 --> 19:10.609
LUCKILY, IT'S ONLY
FOR SIX MONTHS,

19:10.610 --> 19:13.032
AND THEN WHEN I COME BACK, WE CAN
PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF, RIGHT?

19:14.484 --> 19:16.074
SURE.

19:16.075 --> 19:17.406
WAIT.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.907
I CAN'T DO THIS.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.580
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU'RE GREAT AT KISSING.

19:21.831 --> 19:25.335
NO, MARCO. WHEN I SAID I CAN'T
LIVE IN DENIAL, I MEANT IT.

19:26.336 --> 19:27.996
OKAY, SIX MONTHS IS A LONG TIME.

19:27.997 --> 19:29.919
WHO KNOWS WHAT OUR LIVES
WILL BE LIKE THEN

19:31.341 --> 19:33.923
YOU CHOSE JAPAN,
AND THAT'S FINE.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.676
WHAT WE HAD WAS GREAT, BUT...

19:38.798 --> 19:39.849
IT'S OVER.

19:42.141 --> 19:43.683
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

19:47.267 --> 19:49.769
ARE YOU SURE IT'S OVER? BECAUSE
THAT KISS WAS REALLY GOOD.

19:51.771 --> 19:53.152
AS GOOD AS IT WAS,
GET IN THE CAR.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.321
SAYONARA.

20:03.162 --> 20:04.284
SAYONARA.

20:13.883 --> 20:16.925
MM, I GOTTA TELL YOU GUYS,
THAT MACHINE MAKES ONE...

20:16.926 --> 20:19.888
GREAT, EXCEEDINGLY
TINY CUP OF COFFEE.

20:19.889 --> 20:20.800
(laughing)

20:20.801 --> 20:22.180
LISTEN, YOU TWO.

20:22.181 --> 20:25.644
IF WE SAID ANYTHING TO
UPSET YOU, WE'RE SORRY.

20:25.645 --> 20:27.976
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S GOT
THE WORD "IF" IN IT,

20:27.977 --> 20:29.228
IT'S NOT AN APOLOGY.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.691
IT IS TOO AN APOLOGY,

20:32.692 --> 20:34.774
AND BESIDES, SHUT UP!

20:35.985 --> 20:38.987
VERY NICE, COMING FROM
A NURSE OF 35 YEARS.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.952
YOU KNOW, NOW I KNOW WHY YOUR HOSPITAL
WARD HAD THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATE.

20:44.824 --> 20:46.165
THEY WANTED TO DIE.

20:47.957 --> 20:49.868
GUYS, I'M SORRY. SORRY
TO INTERRUPT HERE,

20:49.869 --> 20:52.080
BUT I JUST WANTED TO
LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT

20:52.081 --> 20:53.582
MEL AND I GOT YOU
A LITTLE PRESENT.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.925
YOU KNOW, JUST A LITTLE WAY OF US
SAYING THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY.

20:56.926 --> 20:57.926
- OH, WONDERFUL.
- YEAH, YEAH.

20:57.927 --> 20:59.378
YES, WE DID.

20:59.379 --> 21:00.429
(whispers) GOOD IDEA.

21:00.430 --> 21:04.092
OOH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:04.093 --> 21:06.725
AH, IT WILL LOOK GREAT
ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

21:06.726 --> 21:09.439
ARE YOU KIDDING? THAT'S
GOING ON MY NIGHTSTAND.

21:10.890 --> 21:12.942
COME ON, YOU DON'T
APPRECIATE CRAFTSMANSHIP.

21:14.153 --> 21:15.354
SO ONCE THEY LEAVE,

21:15.355 --> 21:16.945
WE'RE GETTING RID OF THE
ESPRESSO MACHINE, RIGHT?

21:16.946 --> 21:18.897
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. I'M
RETURNING IT TO THAT DUDE

21:18.898 --> 21:20.239
ON EMMY LOU'S LIST FOR SURE.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.453
PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO SNUGGLE
WITH HIM A LITTLE, THOUGH.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.905
(both gasp)
