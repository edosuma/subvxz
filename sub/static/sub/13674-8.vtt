WEBVTT

00:23.149 --> 00:24.810
(Breathes deeply)

00:37.663 --> 00:39.369
(Knocking, door opens)

00:42.001 --> 00:43.366
I hope that's good news.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.629
It is. You're still negative, LaDonna.

00:49.008 --> 00:51.169
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.835
I've been praying.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.681
Lord, I've been praying.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.019
I have to take more tests?

01:01.145 --> 01:03.056
You are done with all of that.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.349
And the medications?

01:04.482 --> 01:06.848
Just finish the last course of antibiotics.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.690
Oh, my God.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.903
— You're smoking more.
— You can tell?

01:13.032 --> 01:14.272
Mm—hm.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.618
And your blood pressure is too high.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.285
I'm gonna have the doctor write you
a prescription before you have a stroke.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.497
I aim to quit.

01:24.627 --> 01:25.833
Soon.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.496
How are things with you and your husband?

01:30.216 --> 01:31.422
ngmm.

01:32.718 --> 01:35.630
He's a patient man, but Ijust...

01:36.764 --> 01:38.174
couldn't tell him.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.969
- You know?
— He needs to know.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.933
This will help,

01:43.062 --> 01:44.598
knowing that I'm not...

01:45.731 --> 01:47.596
(Sighs) I won't have to explain.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.893
Protection?

01:49.026 --> 01:51.403
Hm! We ain't even getting that far.

01:53.990 --> 01:58.780
I think you need to talk to someone,
you and Mr. Williams.

01:59.412 --> 02:01.118
I know some wonderful counselors.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.488
OK. Let me think about that.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.911
Deep breath.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.295
(Exhales slowly)

02:10.423 --> 02:12.084
Again.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.041
(Exhales slowly)

03:51.190 --> 03:54.557
— Music lovers, storm—tossed comrades...
- (Whooping)

03:54.693 --> 03:57.400
— citizens of a tattered Who Dat Nation.
— (Man) That's us.

03:57.530 --> 04:02.024
It was Eldridge Cleaver, or Ward Cleaver,
possibly June Cleaver,

04:02.159 --> 04:04.366
but definitely not the Beaver,

04:04.495 --> 04:08.283
who declared that if
you aren't part of the solution,

04:08.416 --> 04:09.747
you're part of the problem.

04:09.875 --> 04:14.244
This is the world debut
of DJ Davis and the Brassy Knoll.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.964
And we are definitely
part of the problem!

04:18.092 --> 04:19.628
(J‘ Band starts playing)

04:20.928 --> 04:23.010
(Both) J‘ The Road Home ain't no road home

04:23.139 --> 04:25.505
J‘ I'm sorry, you need a form
J‘ But no, man, see

04:25.641 --> 04:28.257
J‘ I'm sorry, you need a form
J‘ But no, man, see

04:28.394 --> 04:30.601
J‘ I'm sorry, you need a form
J‘ No, man, see

04:30.729 --> 04:32.981
J‘ Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

04:33.107 --> 04:35.268
J‘ I been patient and waiting here a long time

04:35.401 --> 04:37.983
J‘ Up in this long line,
like I'm trying to use the john

04:38.112 --> 04:40.945
J‘ But I'm just trying to get
my little nickel and dime

04:41.073 --> 04:43.815
J‘ But they can't bring back
what I lost up in this city of mine, shit

04:43.951 --> 04:46.943
J‘ I ain't got no papenNork,
Katrina came and left with it

04:47.079 --> 04:49.661
J‘ She took the house,
the clothes and all of my fillies

04:49.790 --> 04:52.076
J‘ She probably would've took my life
if I didn't take it with me

04:52.209 --> 04:54.746
J‘ But I ain't let her get me,
no, I ain't let her get me...

04:54.879 --> 04:57.746
— Sounds good.
— Don't theyjust?

04:57.882 --> 05:02.592
- You seem surprised.
— I had my doubts, I do confess.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.961
- Oh yeah.
— Oh yeah, boy.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.474
— Go, Davis!
— J‘ Funny how you calling it the Road Home

05:07.600 --> 05:09.966
J‘ You left my people in the street,
now they all alone

05:10.102 --> 05:12.809
J‘ Wrap 'em up in red tape
and fuck with their head

05:12.938 --> 05:15.429
J‘ You might as well use duct tape
and shoot 'em dead

05:15.566 --> 05:17.852
J‘ So yeah, there ain't really no road home

05:17.985 --> 05:20.772
J‘ Leaving people wherever you had 'em flown

05:20.905 --> 05:23.317
J‘ Man, ain't you happy
all the colored folks gone?

05:23.449 --> 05:25.940
J‘ Oh shit,
who you gonna get to mow your lawn? J‘

05:26.076 --> 05:29.409
(LaDonna)
No, no, I know where it's at. Thanks.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.199
I'll see you then.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.039
- Here you go, Ma.
— Who was that, babe?

05:38.172 --> 05:41.255
A Miss Baron, from the DA's.

05:41.383 --> 05:44.716
— She's the one you've been talking to?
— No, a new one, just assigned.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.302
Lord, no wonder they can't get a conviction.

05:47.431 --> 05:48.637
What did she want?

05:49.350 --> 05:51.511
l have to go there day after tomorrow
to meet her.

05:51.644 --> 05:54.135
- She said it wouldn't take long.
— You want me to come with you?

05:54.271 --> 05:57.013
— I can reschedule.
— No sense in both of us wasting our time.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.310
Hm. All right.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.443
(Larry chuckles)

06:03.572 --> 06:06.530
J‘ l'm hurtin' inside, you can't see,
look at the hurt in my eyes

06:06.659 --> 06:09.196
J‘ I done lost everything I own,
even the couple alive

06:09.328 --> 06:12.820
J‘ Big ups to everyone that survived,
and not one motherfucking word

06:12.957 --> 06:16.791
J‘ Because you standing there
lying about the state of the union on my TV

06:16.919 --> 06:19.501
J‘ Last year we got 163

06:19.630 --> 06:23.214
J‘ I guess you haters is all I heard, not...

06:25.010 --> 06:26.591
J‘ ..one...

06:26.720 --> 06:28.301
J‘ fucking word

06:30.933 --> 06:33.640
Fellow Americans,
I would like to present to you...

06:33.769 --> 06:35.350
the President of the United States,

06:35.479 --> 06:37.265
George W Bush...

06:38.148 --> 06:39.684
(Audience jeer)

06:40.859 --> 06:43.191
..in his annual State of the Union.

06:43.988 --> 06:46.149
(Mimics George W Bush)
Good to see you, New Orleans.

06:46.282 --> 06:48.022
- Good to see you.
— (Woman) Asshole!

06:48.576 --> 06:51.864
New Orleans,
I had some mighty high times here.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.074
— Some mighty high times.
— (Laughter)

06:55.207 --> 06:58.199
You got to love your town. But any...

06:58.335 --> 07:02.704
Oh my God. Hey, how'd you get past
the Secret Service there, fella?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.957
— Is he good?
- Yeah!

07:13.392 --> 07:15.132
Who says I don't like black people?

07:16.729 --> 07:19.266
Kanye can't step to me like that.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.263
The fool gonna wake up in Guantanamo.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.810
(Laughter)

07:22.943 --> 07:26.151
(Woman) Wrong for that. He's wrong for that!

07:26.280 --> 07:28.145
"To the great people of New Orleans..."

07:28.282 --> 07:30.489
— (Man) Yeah, that's us.
— "..and the Gulf Coast,

07:30.618 --> 07:32.358
"I say to you..."

07:39.043 --> 07:40.954
(Man) Hand it out right here.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.622
(Audience groan)

07:45.049 --> 07:46.414
J‘ Not...

07:47.593 --> 07:48.833
J‘ one...

07:50.763 --> 07:52.253
J‘ fuckin'...

07:54.266 --> 07:56.928
J‘ word! J‘

08:02.691 --> 08:04.522
— (J‘ Music ends)
— (Cheering)

08:06.820 --> 08:08.356
How are you doing, Dutchman?

08:08.489 --> 08:10.480
- Don.
— Stanley.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.277
How you doing, Captain?

08:13.285 --> 08:14.491
You all right?

08:14.620 --> 08:17.362
l'm sleeping in a trailer,
pissing in a Porta Potti,

08:17.498 --> 08:18.829
cutting my hands —

08:18.957 --> 08:21.164
the hands I play music with — to shreds.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.829
- Picture that.
— What's not to like, man?

08:22.961 --> 08:24.826
— Don't forget the mosquitoes.
- (Laughter)

08:24.963 --> 08:28.171
Mosquitoes so big they can stand flat—footed
and fuck turkeys.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.416
And the no—see—ums.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.758
(Laughter)

08:33.555 --> 08:36.012
— And tomorrow's payday, y'all.
- Yes, sir.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.097
Tomorrow's back to civilization.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.976
- I'll buy you lunch.
— Damn straight you will.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.309
Shit.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.443
(Davina) You and Daddy can't cooperate
over a damn pot of beans and rice.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.076
No, see, this is gonna work.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.784
I'm gonna write and arrange,
produce the sessions.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.029
He gonna front the songs
and do his thing.

09:00.165 --> 09:03.123
- His Indian thing?
— Yeah. See, what I'm gonna tell him is —

09:03.252 --> 09:05.083
and you and Cheri gonna back me up on this —

09:05.212 --> 09:07.544
is that the label is gonna
give us a decent advance

09:07.673 --> 09:09.379
and he gonna be cut in for some of that.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.215
— An advance?
— Yeah, you know we can't get him

09:12.344 --> 09:14.721
to take a dime from us
to fix up the damn house.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.180
- I know it.
— Right, and how long Road Home gonna take?

09:18.308 --> 09:20.048
But if he thinks he earned it...

09:20.728 --> 09:23.219
— When are you going down there?
- In a few days.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.597
There's some stuff I gotta line up
in New York first.

09:26.734 --> 09:30.943
Boy, you better hope he doesn't find out
you lying about that advance.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.237
How's he gonna know?

09:34.366 --> 09:37.403
You've gotta treat your instruments
like it's your treasure.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.151
Take care of it,

09:39.288 --> 09:40.778
it'll take care of you.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.621
— Would you agree, Mr. Batiste?
— I say amen to that.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.163
Where's your case, Mr. Batiste?

09:46.295 --> 09:48.160
— It's a long story.
— It got stolen, huh?

09:48.297 --> 09:50.379
- Something like that.
— Horns? Embouchure.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.920
I'll sing concert B—flat on "la," you sing.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.088
J‘ La!

09:56.221 --> 09:59.429
(All) J‘ La!

09:59.558 --> 10:01.048
Very nice, strong voice.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.550
Now buzz "la."

10:02.686 --> 10:05.098
Two, ready, buzz.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.108
Thank you very much.
Let's add percussion, please.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.951
Four quarter notes with the band,

10:22.080 --> 10:23.206
buzz first then sing.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.698
Two and ready. Buzz.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.371

(All) I La!

10:35.761 --> 10:37.797
(I All buzz)

10:37.930 --> 10:39.841
(All) I La! I

10:39.973 --> 10:42.965
Thank you. Mr. Batiste, would you go
and assist the horn section, please?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.092
— Yup.
— Do it again, band.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.685
But let's add the bass.

10:46.814 --> 10:50.352
Good posture.
Chin up, flutes, parallel to the floor.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.475
Ready, buzz.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.272
— (J‘ Drumming)
- (J‘ All buzz)

10:54.404 --> 10:56.690
- (All) J‘ La!
— Tighten the corners of your mouth.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.815
— (I All buzz)
— Keep your chin flat.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.737
(All) I La!

11:00.869 --> 11:02.905
(I All buzz)

11:03.038 --> 11:05.404
— (All) J‘ La!
— Robert, that's good lip tension,

11:05.541 --> 11:09.955
but blow out faster. All right,
blow from your belly; not your chest.

11:10.087 --> 11:12.499
— Your bellybutton out.
— (I All buzz)

11:12.631 --> 11:14.838
- (All) J‘ La!
— Good. Buzz.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.047
(I All buzz)

11:16.176 --> 11:18.212
Just tell her another five per cent.

11:19.972 --> 11:20.961
Uh—huh.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.714
Another five per cent.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.763
And if she has a painter
she can recommend...?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.135
Thank you.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.858
Mr. King, sorry to keep you waiting.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.353
No problem.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.525
— You were in the army?
— Military police, two tours of Iraq.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.778
Investigating orjust locking up drunks?

11:45.914 --> 11:48.246
Investigating mostly.
Some of the other.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.458
- Are you from here?
— Algiers, born and raised.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.416
Fischer before they tore it down.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.547
And you're not interested
in police work anymore?

11:57.676 --> 12:01.510
Not the best time to go that way,
you know what I mean?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.382
Well, to be honest, I don't know
if this case is going anywhere.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.894
I gave it up once already

12:08.020 --> 12:09.726
and the law clinic came back to me

12:09.855 --> 12:11.891
with a similar case
that might be related,

12:12.024 --> 12:15.312
so I told the Abreu family I'd take it back
on a contingency basis.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.480
I can't work on contingency.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.604
I gotta get paid
whether it goes anywhere or not.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.322
I understand.
Believe me, I have plenty of work.

12:22.451 --> 12:27.161
I can afford to hire a first—rate, world—class
investigator such as yourself.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.369
I'm worth it.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.868
Can you start tomorrow?

12:31.001 --> 12:32.582
I can start today.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.205
(J‘ Vocalizes)

12:39.468 --> 12:42.835
J‘ Happy people everywhere

12:43.472 --> 12:47.431
J‘ Make it hard to sing the blues

12:47.559 --> 12:49.220
J‘ Well its... J‘

12:49.353 --> 12:51.765
— (Strums chord)
— That's nice.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.146
— You think?
- Yeah.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.106
— Yeah, I agree.
- G-minor.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.441
If I may...

12:58.570 --> 12:59.776
(Annie sings)

12:59.905 --> 13:01.941
..how many hundreds
of times in a row...

13:02.074 --> 13:03.564
J‘ Happy people everywhere...

13:03.700 --> 13:05.952
..have y'all played that since yesterday?

13:06.078 --> 13:08.114
— J‘ Make it hard...
— Did I say hundreds?

13:08.246 --> 13:11.579
That would be a very, very,
very conservative estimate.

13:12.793 --> 13:15.125
Hey, you have to share this with the world.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.620
Yoo—hoo! Test—drive this in front of a crowd.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.167
Harley, tell her!

13:20.300 --> 13:23.588
- (Both stop playing)
— You're right. You gotta play in public.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.509
If I see you, I'm—a fuck up.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.102
Well, then I'll just stand in the back.

13:34.690 --> 13:37.306
No. No. (Laughs)

13:37.442 --> 13:39.774
— No. No.
— OK.

13:41.446 --> 13:45.234
— J‘ All that music in the air...
- (Phone rings)

13:45.367 --> 13:49.076
J‘ Happy people everywhere

13:49.204 --> 13:50.785
— J‘ Make it hard to sing the blues
— Hey!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.654
- (Woman) Hey.
— How you doing?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.531
- Not too bad.
— Hold on just a second.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.501
— I'm gonna take this. I gotta take this.
— Oh, by all means.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.790
J‘ Oh, no, I ain't got the time... J‘

13:59.923 --> 14:01.504
No, no, I'd love to help.

14:02.801 --> 14:06.385
Susan's working on it,
but if you could just go see Jacques.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.004
I appreciate it. Bye.

14:09.141 --> 14:13.009
Dude, I work in the best restaurant
in New York City.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.636
I am at the forefront of a new age of dining,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.387
the new paradigm.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.685
Then I've got to cook on this
electric piece of shit.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.979
A little hyperbolic,
but I don't necessarily disagree.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.522
It's really that good — Lucky Peach?

14:23.655 --> 14:26.192
It's not just that it's good,
it's...it's different.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.189
It's something totally new.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.578
It's fine dining, but it's not.

14:30.704 --> 14:31.693
Right? Am I right?

14:31.830 --> 14:34.537
It has none of the pretension of,
like, Le Bernardin.

14:34.666 --> 14:37.703
— No offense.
— Whoa! None taken, but you loved it.

14:37.836 --> 14:39.622
I did. I did. It'sjust...

14:39.755 --> 14:43.213
It's fucking Michelin—level food
over a fucking counter.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.627
We cook for other cooks.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.673
I mean half our customers
after 11:00 are other chefs.

14:48.805 --> 14:53.139
Your chef and yours come to mine
to eat our fucking food.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.385
That is something totally new.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.308
You'll see. All right.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.103
And voila.

15:02.235 --> 15:06.148
- All right.
— Scrapple from the Apple...

15:06.281 --> 15:08.067
but with a twist.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.862
- Scrapple, my favorite.
— Everything but the oink.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.029
— The squeal.
- The oink.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.652
A new take on an old standby.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.115
- Mm! What is that, ginger?
— Cilantro, yummy. It'd be good with grits.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.242
- Shit.
— What? What's wrong with it?

15:20.378 --> 15:22.414
Imagine if we worked on this
at Lucky Peach, right?

15:22.547 --> 15:24.253
If we all worked on this idea together?

15:24.382 --> 15:26.418
Scrapple — it'd be transcendent.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.793
I'm telling you, my chef,
he's doing something special.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.047
We are doing something special.
But this is shit.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.765
— Whoa!
— Dude, don't throw that away.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.476
— We'll eat it.
- Really?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.763
Take it, you fucking jackals.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.107
— You sicken me.
- Thank you.

15:44.236 --> 15:47.820
(Toni) The cops tell the Abreus
that their son was found on Marais Street,

15:47.948 --> 15:50.781
died during the storm,
exact date unknown,

15:50.909 --> 15:52.865
cause of death undetermined — "Sorry".

15:52.994 --> 15:55.406
That doesn't sit
so well with them, so...

15:57.457 --> 16:01.245
It turns out Joey Abreu
died inside Robideaux's,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.126
not on the street,

16:04.256 --> 16:06.292
with a gunshot wound to his head.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.289
The investigating officer's report,

16:08.426 --> 16:10.633
along with several casings,
has gone missing

16:10.762 --> 16:12.298
and nobody knows where.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.636
Oh man.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.758
So we poster Joey's face
all around the area,

16:18.603 --> 16:20.810
find a young man
who was in the store

16:20.939 --> 16:23.430
when the cops came in
and started beating people.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.852
He see Abreu in the store?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.647
No, and he says
he didn't hear any gunshots either.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.612
But he can't or won't ID the cops.

16:31.449 --> 16:35.158
But I talked to two First District officers...

16:35.287 --> 16:37.824
Holy shit. They confirmed it?

16:37.956 --> 16:39.992
The ass—kicking, not the killing.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.457
One of the officers took some rifle fire,

16:42.586 --> 16:43.951
shot up his squad car,

16:44.087 --> 16:46.624
and then he came back
to Robideaux's with a posse.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.587
And that's when they cleared the store?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.753
And then some of them —
no names yet -

16:50.886 --> 16:53.923
chased a bunch of project knuckleheads
back in over here

16:54.055 --> 16:57.923
including a career criminal
by the name of Leon Seals.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.097
(Girl) Tomorrow, after we get out.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.690
- Tonight.
— We've got school tomorrow, Sof.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.357
- I've got an algebra test.
— It's a quiz. You're such a wuss.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.275
We can't get fucked up tonight.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.071
Come here.

17:23.293 --> 17:24.783
You sure?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.581
ls someone home?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.756
— Miss Beaulieu?
- Yeah?

17:35.889 --> 17:38.255
I'm Toni Bernette.
This is Anthony King.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.473
We're here to talk to you about Leon Seals.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.442
We'll come back tomorrow.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.819
J‘ Stars are tracking us all the way

17:57.953 --> 18:00.569
J‘ Things are changing here every day

18:00.705 --> 18:03.742
J‘ I'm okay and the sky is still blue

18:05.752 --> 18:08.368
J‘ The way I see it, we make a choice

18:08.505 --> 18:10.871
J‘ Take or leave it, just believe it

18:11.007 --> 18:14.170
J‘ Tell me now,
what are you gonna do?

18:16.596 --> 18:20.214
J‘ I'm gonna believe it, won't you?

18:20.934 --> 18:25.223
J‘ Hey, I've gotta believe it, don't you?

18:26.731 --> 18:32.977
J‘ I want to believe it, don't you? J‘

18:34.239 --> 18:36.901
— This is a good place for a mob hit.
— (Chuckling)

18:37.033 --> 18:40.946
If it's 1926 and Vito Corleone
still looks like De Niro.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.161
— Yeah.
— This town, man.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.906
Would you rather be in some chain steakhouse
out in the 'burbs?

18:46.042 --> 18:49.250
Oh, not at all, but once in a while
new might be better.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.999
I know one thing,
new is definitely cheaper.

18:57.095 --> 19:00.804
You guys are spending at least half a million
a year too much on all your component cable.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.799
— Maybe more than that.
— The cables we get are quality.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.266
Oh, come on, please.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.728
The cables you're overpaying for are
the very same cables I'm offering for less.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.973
They all come from the same
Taiwanese warehouse.

19:14.362 --> 19:19.152
It's one thing to stiff—arm the Chicano shitkicker
from Dallas, but my partner Derek here,

19:19.284 --> 19:21.900
he's brought rain for the mayor
for a couple elections now

19:22.037 --> 19:23.402
and he's waited his turn.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.244
Now he's coming at you with a better deal.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.658
That's right.

19:26.791 --> 19:30.079
You're gonna save 50 cents a unit
on the isdn lines,

19:30.211 --> 19:31.337
40 on the FireWire,

19:31.463 --> 19:33.545
even more on
the component—to—component stuff.

19:33.673 --> 19:37.165
I know that's what you told Oliver, but...
I have my doubts.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.466
So here you sit,

19:43.391 --> 19:46.428
ready to piss off Derek here and Oliver
and all their buddies in Zulu

19:46.561 --> 19:48.426
and all their friends in...
What was it again?

19:48.563 --> 19:49.518
BOLD.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.104
BOLD, right.
You're pissing off half the known world

19:52.233 --> 19:54.315
to stay with guys
who are robbing the city blind.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.277
They must...really be friends.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.325
Tell y'all what...

20:02.494 --> 20:07.204
I think it'd be possible,
if you raised your price by 50 cents per unit,

20:07.332 --> 20:11.871
— to sell us FireWire and component cables.
- You want me to raise my prices?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.664
I'm trying to save the city money here.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.796
What about the ISDN line?

20:16.925 --> 20:19.132
I'd leave that with the people
who currently have the contract.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.842
Let them set the prices on those.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.008
— Everybody makes money, huh?
- And everyone stays friends.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.051
It's always nice to make new friends.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.391
(J‘ Song ends)

20:32.524 --> 20:33.855
(Cheering)

20:36.194 --> 20:37.559
All right, thank y'all.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.435
Whoo! Nice!

20:40.490 --> 20:42.355
Annie, Harley, y'all wanna do your song?

20:42.492 --> 20:45.234
— I'm game.
— Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.907
— Come on, it's a friendly audience.
— They're very sweet.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.324
I don't think so.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.788
I... It's not ready.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.578
OK, so it's kinda like bread.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.621
OK. All right, all right.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.166
These things take time, y'all.
Next time, OK?

20:57.298 --> 20:59.880
All right, so we'll do this instead.

21:01.219 --> 21:05.553
J‘ I feel like a kite without a string

21:07.559 --> 21:11.222
J‘ Only my tail to guide me

21:15.233 --> 21:20.068
J‘ Just paper and sticks and tattered sheets

21:22.198 --> 21:25.736
J‘ Waiting on a friendly wind

21:28.204 --> 21:33.073
J‘ Hold all our memories in one hand

21:33.209 --> 21:36.121
J‘ So tight that you won't let 'em go

21:41.759 --> 21:45.923
J‘ And in the other hand we pray

21:47.015 --> 21:49.472
J‘ That the wind

21:49.601 --> 21:52.092
J‘ And the panic and the rain

21:52.228 --> 21:55.186
J‘ Will all turn to a...

21:55.315 --> 21:58.899
J‘ Soft and quiet...

21:59.027 --> 22:02.815
J‘ Snow...

22:05.700 --> 22:08.908
I just feel like we lost something
in modern jazz, you know?

22:09.037 --> 22:11.574
Somewhere along the way.
Something...

22:11.706 --> 22:15.039
New Orleans music always held on to,
probably 'cause we so damn backward.

22:15.919 --> 22:19.457
— Butjoy, life. You know what I'm saying?
— Yeah, I do.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.752
Anyway, so I've been going home for months
and I didn't even know.

22:22.884 --> 22:24.920
I'm listening to old stuff

22:25.053 --> 22:28.045
and then old, old stuff.

22:28.181 --> 22:31.218
Then I'm pulling out the Library of Congress
damn recordings.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.184
Pretty soon I'm walking around
in my New York apartment

22:34.312 --> 22:36.098
singing along with field hollers and shit.

22:36.231 --> 22:39.314
— You know, fife and drum bands.
— Fife and drum bands?

22:39.442 --> 22:41.728
Angola chain—gang chants
and shit, you know?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.603
I'm previous to previous to previous.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.320
And I'm damn near driving myself crazy

22:46.449 --> 22:49.156
trying to get back to something that
I don't even know. All right.

22:49.285 --> 22:53.369
So finally I end up on Mardi Gras morning
with my father under the bridge,

22:53.498 --> 22:56.865
and I'm hearing those rhythms, and at the
same time I'm hearing something else.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.708
I'm hearing, you know,
just some real jazz

22:59.837 --> 23:02.328
from a box, from a boom box, in one ear,

23:02.465 --> 23:05.502
and at the same time I got the drums

23:05.635 --> 23:09.048
and my daddy's calls...
in the other ear.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.136
You know...
J‘ Shallow water, oh, mama J‘

23:11.266 --> 23:15.430
Right? And it fucking knocked me over,
all that in my ear at once.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.894
Wow, man. That's incredible.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.855
I'm feeling that. I wonder why
nobody ever thought to do that before.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.895
Right? See, I knew you'd see it right away.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.894
It's gotta be somebody
who comes from the tradition

23:26.030 --> 23:28.772
but who could also
live outside of it musically like you.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.445
Man, D, I see everything you're saying,

23:31.578 --> 23:34.536
but the purists from both sides,
how are they gonna take this, man?

23:34.664 --> 23:37.747
It's not straightjazz
and it's not straight New Orleans.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.126
They're gonna rip this apart.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.208
Never mind what the
old—time Indians gonna say.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.168
Well, you can't please them anyway.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.791
Fuck it. Let's do it.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.509
— I'm down, ya heard.
- All right.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.101
— What are you doing?
— Driving you.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.349
No. No, no, no, no.
You've got patients.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.612
— I've rescheduled 'em.
- No. No, no.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.194
You've got to go to work, honey.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.814
— You've got people depending on you.
— No, you're depending on me.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.066
- Baby.
— This is more important, LaDonna.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.658
Get in the car.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.527
Come on, baby. Get in the car.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.128
Seat belt.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.424
(Engine starts)

24:35.308 --> 24:37.424
I heard ya. I'll be there.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.801
On second thought,
get there a half an hour early,

24:39.937 --> 24:41.768
show Batiste you're not a fuck—up.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.604
Uh—uh.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.811
You might make an oysterman yet.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.325
— Living the dream.
— (Chuckles)

24:53.451 --> 24:55.908
That's enough to get you to the gig tomorrow
in one piece.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.493
Come on, man. I got rent to pay.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.364
Give me your landlord's number,
I'll drop it off for you.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.365
You get the rest at the gig.

25:02.502 --> 25:06.086
Show up late, I'm gonna lay it out on the street
and piss on it.

25:06.881 --> 25:09.623
And you are taking me to lunch too.
I'm—a hold you to it.

25:09.759 --> 25:12.091
- I said I would.
— You're gonna chip in for the gas too.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.969
(J‘ Blues piano)

25:23.815 --> 25:25.601
J‘ Life...

25:26.818 --> 25:28.979
J‘ Is a near—death...

25:30.613 --> 25:33.195
J‘ Experience

25:40.957 --> 25:44.620
J‘ Hell is right here

25:48.798 --> 25:52.336
J‘ On this great big earth

25:56.305 --> 26:00.093
J‘ And it could be a little taste of heaven

26:04.856 --> 26:08.519
J‘ If we only knew our worth

26:12.655 --> 26:14.646
J‘ All we got to do

26:16.367 --> 26:18.983
J‘ Want it bad enough

26:21.914 --> 26:25.202
J‘ Push ourself through... J‘

26:37.597 --> 26:39.588
Hi, we have an appointment

26:39.724 --> 26:42.557
with an assistant district attorney,
Brigitte Baron.

26:47.899 --> 26:51.391
And who is the rhythm section
gonna be in this thing?

26:52.195 --> 26:55.107
Well, maybe Ron Carter,
Carl Allen if we can get him.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.527
Give a thought to maybe
getting Uganda on percussion.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.571
Yeah, that's a good idea.
We're gonna record this in New York so...

27:01.704 --> 27:04.571
So you're gonna split this like a banana split?

27:04.707 --> 27:07.073
Half in New York, half in New Orleans?

27:07.210 --> 27:08.325
That's the point, Mac.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.873
For keyboards, we need somebody
who can go both ways,

27:11.005 --> 27:12.085
and that's you.

27:12.215 --> 27:15.173
Well, if your ass wasn't a big chief

27:15.301 --> 27:17.883
and your pa wasn't a big chief,

27:18.012 --> 27:22.381
I would think we might all get a hatchet
in the rear of our brain cells.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.142
We good, we good. My daddy,
he gonna call on it. He gonna do the chants.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.807
You gonna go in the studio
with your pa, right?

27:28.940 --> 27:31.898
He's gonna, like, be down
with this whole project?

27:32.652 --> 27:35.234
- Will be.
— But you ain't asked him yet?

27:39.826 --> 27:43.569
Well, this is shakier
than I thought it would be.

27:43.704 --> 27:47.037
You and Chief Lambreaux
in the same room...

27:47.166 --> 27:51.034
Y'all might torch the whole building down
before it's over, you know?

27:51.170 --> 27:53.877
I mean, I don't wanna hang no overcoats, but...

27:54.006 --> 27:58.124
— It ain't gonna be that bad.
— Just keep telling yourself that shit.

27:58.261 --> 27:59.467
Mac, you down? You in, man?

27:59.595 --> 28:03.133
Desitively. You better hurry up and know that.

28:03.266 --> 28:06.679
I would not miss this maneuver
for nothing on the planet.

28:06.811 --> 28:10.679
I wanna be the one
that lives to tell the tale of this.

28:10.815 --> 28:11.975
It could be a myth.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.141
— Thanks, Mac.
— You got it.

28:16.737 --> 28:20.229
Everything is oaks and herbs, my nerbs.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.697
Apologies for the short notice.

28:21.826 --> 28:24.659
Ijust wanted to meet you and go over
your statement one more time.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.028
It's awkward meeting in court
for the first time.

28:27.164 --> 28:29.655
My husband doesn't have to be here, does he?

28:29.792 --> 28:32.033
— No, if he doesn't wanna be.
— No, no, I'll stay.

28:32.169 --> 28:35.036
— See, baby, you don't have to be...
— I'm here for you, baby.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.207
Go ahead.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.877
We've told their lawyers
we intend to go to trial.

28:39.010 --> 28:42.093
We want to convince them
it's in their best interests to take a plea.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.086
So I wouldn't have to testify?

28:44.223 --> 28:46.555
- Not if they plead.
— And if they don't?

28:46.684 --> 28:48.515
We may proceed
with the other case first.

28:48.644 --> 28:53.058
— There's an additional corroborating witness.
— OK, and if you do that, what?

28:53.190 --> 28:55.602
Chances are good that yours
will never even come to court.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.600
Wait a minute. Other case?

28:57.737 --> 29:01.104
There's another case?
You didn't say anything about another case.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.275
Same perps, same MO.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.194
A woman further up St. Bernard,

29:04.327 --> 29:07.865
convenience store —
robbery, beating, gang rape.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.579
This is an important case for this office.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.539
We can get these assholes off the street.

29:12.668 --> 29:14.204
God knows how many women...

29:23.304 --> 29:26.717
Mrs. Williams...
do you need a minute?

29:28.017 --> 29:29.632
(Quietly) Please.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.970
Take your time.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.615
(Knocking)

29:46.744 --> 29:49.907
— Are we ready?
— Already been. Stopped on my way.

29:50.039 --> 29:52.621
I figured she'd be more likely
to talk to me on my own.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.365
OK, did she?

29:54.502 --> 29:56.333
Like she told the law clinic folks,

29:56.462 --> 29:59.204
she saw some cops chase
Leon Seals into an apartment,

29:59.340 --> 30:00.375
heard two shots.

30:00.508 --> 30:03.875
Later on that evening
her brother crept in, found the body.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.296
The same day as Abreu?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.135
The same day as the cops raided Robideaux's.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.971
We don't know when Abreu was shot.
Could've been before or after.

30:10.101 --> 30:11.011
Whose side are you on?

30:11.143 --> 30:12.974
I'm just pointing out the holes in our case,

30:13.104 --> 30:15.015
like we got casings
for one and not the other.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.809
And we got witnesses
that won't ID the cops in either.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.432
Yeah, she ain't budging on that.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.149
So we don't have anything new.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.940
Yes, we do. She told me
where we could find her brother.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.214
— I thought we were having lunch.
- We are.

30:53.310 --> 30:57.144
I had to stop here and buy me some crabs
for my crab boil this weekend.

30:58.357 --> 31:00.018
This is a wholesale place.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.151
What can I say? It's gonna be a big party.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.038
How are you, Cornell?
How's everything?

31:17.168 --> 31:20.035
I'm good. This is a friend of mine, Sonny.

31:20.171 --> 31:22.082
— Sonny, this is Linh.
— Hi.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.420
How are you?

31:24.675 --> 31:25.881
I'm good. I'm good.

31:26.010 --> 31:28.501
You're hopeless, that's what you are.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.595
I need two boxes of
your number ones, baby girl.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.090
— Can you hook a brother up?
- Ice?

31:34.226 --> 31:36.057
— Please.
— Crab boil, huh?

31:36.187 --> 31:37.768
— Mm.
— Am I invited?

31:37.897 --> 31:39.558
Baby girl, you're the guest of honor.

31:39.690 --> 31:40.930
(Chuckles)

31:41.067 --> 31:43.353
(Calls out in Vietnamese)

31:47.448 --> 31:49.188
(Chuckles) You're tripping, son.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.861
All right, all right, all right.
What's up, fellas?

31:55.998 --> 31:57.829
— Whoa, what's happening man?
— Mario.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.243
- Yo.
— Lance.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.707
— Hey, man.
— What's going on, Cornell?

32:00.836 --> 32:04.294
- Tim. Terrell coming?
— Yeah, he said he was, you know?

32:04.423 --> 32:06.505
- Yeah, I know.
— Who we got tonight, man?

32:06.634 --> 32:09.171
— Wanda?
— Nah, she's doing a blues cruise.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.885
- Mario. What's up?
— Cornell. I'm good, brother.

32:13.933 --> 32:15.093
Oh!

32:15.226 --> 32:16.682
Herman!

32:16.811 --> 32:19.678
Where your wheels at?
I was counting on a ride home with you.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.805
Man, my car got towed
with my drums in it.

32:21.941 --> 32:22.851
Oh shit, Herm.

32:22.983 --> 32:25.725
Called everybody I knew to borrow a kit.
Nobody called me back yet.

32:25.861 --> 32:27.601
How the fuck you gonna play a gig
without drums?

32:27.738 --> 32:30.070
— I got sticks. I'll figure something out.
- Oh shit.

32:30.199 --> 32:31.609
Hey, straw boss, what's the fine

32:31.742 --> 32:34.154
for somebody coming to the gig
without their instrument?

32:34.286 --> 32:35.901
— Hundred dollar.
- $100.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.778
$100. You pay my tow, I'll pay your fine.

32:37.915 --> 32:39.871
Shit. I'll kick your ass. How about that?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.456
(Chuckling)

32:41.585 --> 32:42.791
(I Rock song on radio)

32:42.920 --> 32:44.660
I love this fucking song.

32:44.797 --> 32:45.832
It's so retro.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.456
Y'all wanna go back and forth
across the bridge one more time?

32:48.592 --> 32:50.844
— Yes. Yes, I do.
— All right.

32:52.012 --> 32:53.388
The river.

32:53.514 --> 32:54.594
(Siren wails)

32:54.723 --> 32:56.805
Oh...fuck!

32:56.934 --> 32:58.424
Fuck.

32:58.561 --> 33:00.768
Fuck! Put it out. Put it out.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.433
— Pull over.
— Oh shit.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.684
(J‘ Can I Change My Mind)

33:17.246 --> 33:19.032
(J‘ Thin, metallic drumming)

33:27.339 --> 33:30.172
J‘ Oh, she didn't bat an eye...

33:30.301 --> 33:32.166
(Woman) Sing it, baby. Yeah, yeah.

33:32.303 --> 33:35.420
J‘ As I packed my bags to leave

33:37.975 --> 33:42.309
J‘ I thought that she would cry

33:42.438 --> 33:45.555
J‘ Sit around in my room and grieve

33:46.817 --> 33:49.980
J‘ Oh, that girl

33:50.112 --> 33:51.773
J‘ She fooled me this time

33:52.865 --> 33:56.483
J‘ She acted like I was
the last thing on her mind

33:57.494 --> 34:03.080
J‘ And now I just wanna start all over again

34:06.086 --> 34:07.997
J‘ Can I change my mind?

34:10.216 --> 34:13.003
J‘ I just wanna change my mind

34:15.471 --> 34:18.258
J‘ Can I change my mind? J‘

34:22.019 --> 34:25.432
Ordering two salmon, two fluke,
one pounded tuna.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.644
I need a concasse now.

34:26.774 --> 34:29.186
Three fluke, three pounded tuna tastings.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.934
— Chef, three pounded tuna.
— On the board, two octopus,

34:32.071 --> 34:34.312
onelangousﬂne,
one caviar pasta.

34:34.448 --> 34:36.814
— Behind.
— Two salmon. Where's my scallop back?

34:36.951 --> 34:39.158
— Let's go!
— Let's go, let's go.

34:41.872 --> 34:44.329
Requesting female officer
to assist with a search,

34:44.458 --> 34:46.574
2800 block of Belle Chasse.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.962
— The car's been reported stolen.
- It's my uncle's.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.170
Should've told him.
Might've given you the keys.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.960
— You wouldn't have to jack the ignition.
- Kerry.

34:54.093 --> 34:57.506
— Whoo!
— Whose shit is this?

34:57.638 --> 35:00.004
Nobody steps to it, we charge all y'all.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.475
— It's mine.
— Come on.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.142
Where were y'all headed
when we stopped you?

35:13.279 --> 35:15.486
We just met them two.
We didn't know they had drugs.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.775
We don't need to say anything.

35:17.908 --> 35:19.944
— My mom's a lawyer.
— You want to play it that way?

35:20.077 --> 35:23.114
All right. Ain't enough
you're riding around in a stolen vehicle,

35:23.247 --> 35:27.081
you've got an open container of alcohol
and you're smelling like a goddamn brewery.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.825
— Who's this belong to?
— It's mine.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.419
I think you would agree
we have probable cause.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.970
Chef?

35:42.099 --> 35:43.589
Do you have a moment?

35:45.602 --> 35:47.217
Of course.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.774
Yes, Chef? What is it?

35:54.903 --> 35:57.280
You are not happy at Le Bernardin.

35:57.406 --> 36:01.649
Oh, Chef, I am so grateful and happy
to be here, you have no idea.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.322
Listen, it's not right for you. I can see it.

36:04.455 --> 36:07.447
It's difficult for someone
who had his own kitchen

36:07.583 --> 36:09.995
— to start again at the bottom.
- Are you firing me?

36:10.127 --> 36:13.369
No, no, lwould never do that,
but I'm glad to make some calls for you.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.917
Is there something you are interested in?

36:16.050 --> 36:18.507
Something you are thinking about?

36:18.635 --> 36:21.672
One of my housemates
has been working for David Chang...

36:21.805 --> 36:23.761
Nick. You met him Mardi Gras night.

36:24.475 --> 36:26.966
Anyway, he's excited about it.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.013
I can call David for you. No problem.

36:29.146 --> 36:32.513
— Well, that's very generous of you.
- He may try you out.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.105
You may like it and stay there.

36:34.234 --> 36:35.974
If not, come back to Le Bernardin.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.487
I don't know what to say.

36:37.613 --> 36:40.025
You need a place
where you can find your own style.

36:40.157 --> 36:41.818
Here, in this position for now,

36:41.950 --> 36:43.906
it's not about expressing yourself.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.572
It's about craftsmanship.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.696
But with David, if he likes you,
anything is possible.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.166
(TV reporter) Fire officials
say the building was unsecured

36:53.295 --> 36:55.832
and it was easy for people to get inside.
In fact, some may...

36:55.964 --> 36:58.956
If I find someone to talk to,
would you come too?

36:59.093 --> 37:02.051
(TV reporter) Tracking down the building's
owners has been a lengthy process.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.170
In August of last year, the property...

37:04.306 --> 37:07.343
I wanted to tell you, OK?
I wanted to tell you.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.012
I didn't know how.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.099
I should've known.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.143
The way you've been acting...

37:16.402 --> 37:18.393
I can't believe I didn't guess.

37:19.488 --> 37:20.978
I'm an idiot.

37:23.242 --> 37:26.109
So when were you ever gonna tell me?

37:27.037 --> 37:30.200
I was hoping I wouldn't ever have to.

37:32.668 --> 37:35.785
How many times did I ask you
to get rid of that bar?

37:35.921 --> 37:38.287
How many times?
But you didn't, did you?

37:38.424 --> 37:40.665
I didn't, all right?

37:41.552 --> 37:43.088
I didn't.

37:43.220 --> 37:46.383
What difference does it make now?

37:47.141 --> 37:48.256
Larry?

37:52.104 --> 37:53.264
(Phone rings)

37:55.983 --> 37:57.473
Hello.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.608
Sweetie, what...

38:02.156 --> 38:03.487
You what?

38:06.076 --> 38:08.067
God damn it, Sofia. Where are you?

38:11.248 --> 38:13.034
What are you doing over there?

38:17.463 --> 38:19.124
What did they arrest you for?

38:21.091 --> 38:23.127
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

38:23.260 --> 38:25.342
Don't say anything.
Do you understand me?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.756
Not a thing.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.474
Never mind.

38:32.603 --> 38:35.811
Just don't say anything
and tell Jocelyn that too.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.682
I'll get you out as soon as I can.

38:40.444 --> 38:41.775
I love you.

38:48.619 --> 38:49.950
Um...

38:51.955 --> 38:53.115
(Exhales)

39:00.339 --> 39:03.831
Hi, Judge, this is Toni Bernette. Um...

39:03.967 --> 39:05.343
I'm calling... Uh...

39:05.469 --> 39:06.800
Sorry to call so late

39:06.929 --> 39:11.093
but my daughter has been arrested
in West Jeff

39:11.225 --> 39:14.717
and they're taking her
to Harvey juvenile detention.

39:14.853 --> 39:19.438
If you get this call, could you give me
a call back on this phone?

39:19.566 --> 39:22.228
My cell number. Thank you.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.818
Um... Oh.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.358
(Dialing tones)

39:27.491 --> 39:30.278
You were right — home cooking.

39:30.410 --> 39:33.117
It's harder to say no
when everybody from around the way.

39:33.247 --> 39:35.784
Besides, you brought
a better deal with you.

39:35.916 --> 39:40.205
Oh! I'm not sure anyone in that shop
is even interested in a better deal,

39:40.337 --> 39:41.622
if you catch my drift.

39:41.755 --> 39:45.088
Saving the city money doesn't seem to be
anybody's idea of a priority.

39:46.093 --> 39:47.253
Anyway...

39:48.345 --> 39:49.926
you did all you could...

39:50.055 --> 39:51.591
and I'm grateful.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.214
It doesn't happen
without you extending yourself.

39:54.351 --> 39:55.511
Thanks.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.576
Sof.

40:22.713 --> 40:27.252
(Judge) Family member or legal representation
for the defendant in the courtroom?

40:27.384 --> 40:28.419
Here, Your Honor.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.918
- You are?
— Antoinette Bernette.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.635
Her mother.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.099
— (Electric saw buzzes)
- (Hammering)

40:46.320 --> 40:48.026
Mr. George Cotrell?

40:50.073 --> 40:51.483
That's me.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.908
A hard man to find.

40:55.037 --> 40:57.153
I stopped by your house yesterday,
left you a note.

40:57.289 --> 40:58.654
Ah.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.747
It says "Call Anthony King."

41:00.876 --> 41:02.741
That's me. Can I talk to you?

41:05.088 --> 41:06.749
Sure.

41:08.175 --> 41:09.961
I'm working for an attorney.

41:10.093 --> 41:13.631
She has a similar case
of a client who may,

41:14.765 --> 41:17.677
just may have been shot by the cops
the same day Seals was.

41:17.809 --> 41:21.347
Your sister's saying
she saw three or four cops

41:21.480 --> 41:23.516
chase Seals into an apartment in the Iberville,

41:23.649 --> 41:26.686
then heard two shots,
sees the cops come out but not Seals.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.900
She says she told you about it

41:29.029 --> 41:31.691
and later on you snuck in there,
found him shot dead.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.074
I didn't sneak over there.

41:33.200 --> 41:36.613
I waited till it got dark,
went over there and he was dead.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.861
— Why didn't you report it?
— (Albert) Ooh!

41:38.997 --> 41:42.865
Were you here?
You have any idea of what it was like here?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.332
Hm?

41:44.461 --> 41:45.951
No, sir.

41:46.088 --> 41:48.830
My family was. I was in Iraq.

41:50.175 --> 41:52.211
It's OK, Chief.

41:52.344 --> 41:55.051
We were evacuated
to Oklahoma the next day.

41:55.180 --> 41:58.013
Soon as I got to a phone,
I called it in about the body.

41:58.141 --> 42:03.477
Your sister said she couldn't ID the officers,
but they were First District, most likely.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.437
What are you saying?

42:07.567 --> 42:09.148
She mention any names?

42:15.283 --> 42:16.864
Talk to me, God damn it.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.858
What were you doing in a stolen car?

42:18.995 --> 42:21.737
— Riding around.
— Who are these two boys?

42:21.873 --> 42:23.989
Just two guys we met at a bar.

42:24.126 --> 42:26.162
A bar? What...

42:27.170 --> 42:32.005
What the hell are you doing getting into a car
with two older boys you don't even know?!

42:33.301 --> 42:35.212
I want an answer!

42:36.179 --> 42:38.921
— What, you think that's smart?
— No!

42:39.057 --> 42:41.048
How long have you been smoking marijuana?

42:41.935 --> 42:43.971
Get... Get... Get...

42:44.104 --> 42:45.844
— Sofia!
— Let go!

42:46.690 --> 42:48.021
Where are you going?

42:48.775 --> 42:50.561
— Where?
— Why did he do it?

42:50.694 --> 42:53.185
Do you know? Can you tell me?

42:56.366 --> 42:58.277
I can't. I...

42:58.410 --> 43:00.366
I... Idon't...

43:02.289 --> 43:04.075
I'm sorry, baby.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.083
You can't blame yourself.
You know that.

43:08.211 --> 43:10.122
I know, that's what everyone says.

43:10.255 --> 43:12.962
But it's kind of hard not to.

43:14.926 --> 43:16.382
He loved you so much.

43:16.511 --> 43:20.504
If he loved me so much,
then why did he leave me?

43:20.640 --> 43:22.380
Why did he do it?

43:26.229 --> 43:27.935
That's the question, isn't it?

43:28.899 --> 43:30.480
How could he do this?

43:30.609 --> 43:33.476
To us? To you?

43:33.612 --> 43:36.069
I think about it all the time.

43:36.198 --> 43:39.986
What... What did I do?
What could I have done differently?

43:40.118 --> 43:42.860
Why didn't I see it coming? I...

43:43.705 --> 43:46.572
I've asked myself a million times, Sof,

43:46.708 --> 43:48.073
and I just don't know.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.826
Ijust... Idon't fucking know! (Sobs)

43:50.962 --> 43:52.168
Mom.

43:53.256 --> 43:54.792
I'm not crying.

43:54.925 --> 43:58.258
I'm too fucking mad to cry.

44:11.650 --> 44:12.810
(Toni sobs)

44:12.943 --> 44:14.353
Mama, come on.

44:15.362 --> 44:17.774
It's OK, Mama.

44:25.789 --> 44:28.326
— Hey, Mr. Batiste.
— Hey, Robert.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.831
Your embouchure's getting better.

44:30.961 --> 44:32.747
— Do you feel it?
- Yeah.

44:32.879 --> 44:35.040
— From the belly, right?
— Pushing my bellybutton.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.674
Yeah. Right.

44:38.093 --> 44:39.879
Twinkle Twinkle.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.339
(J‘ Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star)

44:52.816 --> 44:54.522
— Nice tone.
— Yeah?

44:54.651 --> 44:57.188
Yeah, but you gotta keep shedding.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.652
Damn, boy, what happened up there?

45:00.657 --> 45:02.773
My brother hit me on my head with a coconut.

45:04.286 --> 45:06.652
Duck next time. (Chuckles)

45:14.880 --> 45:17.337
So tell me about your knife skills.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.751
They're good. Not great,
but solid good, I think.

45:22.262 --> 45:25.299
I don't know what to say other than
my chef thought I should talk to you,

45:25.432 --> 45:26.763
that I'd be right for this place.

45:26.892 --> 45:28.382
He said I might be happy here.

45:28.518 --> 45:30.554
Well, Eric's awesome, but happy?

45:30.687 --> 45:32.769
I'm not fucking happy.
Who's happy?

45:32.898 --> 45:34.388
I don't even know what that is.

45:34.524 --> 45:36.230
Is that a yes or a no?

45:37.777 --> 45:41.440
Um... I guess, why don't you trail over there
with Bizcocho and Millhouse

45:41.573 --> 45:44.440
and we'll take a look at your mise en place
and knife skills and shit.

45:44.576 --> 45:47.568
But remember this —
just 'cause we're a casual restaurant

45:47.704 --> 45:50.821
doesn't mean we don't hold ourselves
to fine dining standards.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.572
We try to do things the right way.

45:52.709 --> 45:55.246
That usually means doing things
the long, hard, stupid way.

45:55.378 --> 45:58.461
All right, so I guess
I'll see you tomorrow at 8:00.

45:58.590 --> 46:00.626
Thank you, Chef.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.545
Happy? Jesus.

46:20.695 --> 46:22.356
— She asleep?
— Finally.

46:22.489 --> 46:24.104
I think she got a touch of something.

46:24.240 --> 46:26.731
If I had a cold, sore throat, couldn't sleep,

46:26.868 --> 46:29.905
my daddy would give me a spoonful
of whiskey and honey.

46:30.747 --> 46:32.283
Wasn't but five years old.

46:32.415 --> 46:35.202
— Explains a lot.
- Huh?

46:37.337 --> 46:39.749
— How was your day?
— Fine.

46:42.175 --> 46:45.087
- OK, what's wrong?
— Another Mardi Gras, Antoine...

46:45.220 --> 46:48.553
— Yeah?
— ..come and gone, we still here.

46:51.476 --> 46:52.386
I know.

46:52.519 --> 46:55.306
— We gotta do something about that.
- We got money coming in.

46:56.356 --> 46:58.267
You find a place, we'll sign a lease.

46:58.400 --> 47:01.858
— The ball's in your court.
— Waiting to see if your job's gonna pan out.

47:03.071 --> 47:06.234
O ye of little faith.

47:06.366 --> 47:09.904
- Seriously?
— Yeah, I'm... I'm into it, baby.

47:10.870 --> 47:14.829
I'm...
I'm making progress with these kids.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.206
I'm feeling it.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.166
So you're really gonna stick it out?

47:20.422 --> 47:22.253
They really dug the bands in Zulu.

47:22.382 --> 47:25.169
I'm telling you, it made a deep impression...

47:25.301 --> 47:26.916
I mean them and me.

47:29.097 --> 47:32.134
Man, I looked at them kids
and I looked at my boys...

47:36.479 --> 47:38.060
I fucked up, Desiree.

47:38.189 --> 47:41.181
— What d'you mean?
- They don't play.

47:41.317 --> 47:43.057
I mean, my daddy played.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.105
His daddy played. I play.

47:45.238 --> 47:47.729
— They don't play.
— Their mama didn't want them to.

47:47.866 --> 47:49.527
I should've insisted.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.741
They're Batistes,

47:51.870 --> 47:54.532
one of the first families
in New Orleans music.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.622
Alcide and Randall...

48:04.466 --> 48:06.206
I failed them, Desiree.

48:08.762 --> 48:10.468
I failed them.

48:11.681 --> 48:13.012
(J‘ Jazz)

48:23.068 --> 48:24.478
(Passing siren)

49:09.239 --> 49:12.276
- You're in a good mood.
— Listen to the music, cuz.

49:12.408 --> 49:13.739
How can you not be?

49:13.868 --> 49:16.075
It's got that Latin tinge to it.

49:24.587 --> 49:26.202
(Applause)

49:26.339 --> 49:29.206
Delmond Lambreaux,
ladies and gentlemen.

49:30.593 --> 49:33.585
Leroy Jones and the Palm Court Jazz Band.

49:34.139 --> 49:36.004
May I have more applause? Thank you.

49:36.141 --> 49:38.723
- Yeah!
— We'll be right back.

49:38.852 --> 49:40.763
Leroy Jones, thank you, brother. Thank you.

49:40.895 --> 49:43.147
Always a pleasure.
Sit in on the second set?

49:43.273 --> 49:46.481
You ain't kicking me out? A'ight, then.

49:46.609 --> 49:50.477
I just closed a deal with the city
worth 300 grand a year.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.604
Maybe more next year
when Ijack the price.

49:52.740 --> 49:53.650
Sweet.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.944
All you gotta do is come to the party
with a few friends.

49:56.077 --> 49:57.908
And all they ask for in return is...?

49:58.037 --> 50:01.495
Cuz, they don't ask. They never ask.
They don't have to.

50:01.624 --> 50:04.661
They expect you, when all is said and done,
to do the right fucking thing.

50:04.794 --> 50:07.001
And I always do the right fucking thing.

50:13.553 --> 50:16.215
- Abita all right?
— Oh, fine, thank you.

50:17.473 --> 50:18.724
Cheers.

50:20.143 --> 50:22.008
— Your daughter?
— Mm.

50:22.145 --> 50:25.182
— Sofia.
— She doesn't look so happy.

50:25.315 --> 50:29.274
Right now she's grounded
until Mardi Gras 2011.

50:29.402 --> 50:32.269
And then only the day parades. (Chuckles)

50:34.949 --> 50:36.610
I, uh...

50:36.743 --> 50:37.858
talked to Cotrell.

50:37.994 --> 50:39.530
He gave me a name.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.616
His sister said she recognized one of the cops,

50:42.749 --> 50:44.239
a black cop named Billy Wilson.

50:44.375 --> 50:46.707
The others were white,
she didn't know 'em.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.498
It's a start.

50:55.178 --> 50:56.338
(Buzzer)

51:04.646 --> 51:06.386
How you holding up?

51:07.690 --> 51:09.066
It's hard to sleep.

51:09.192 --> 51:11.524
— The food sucks.
— Yeah, I imagine so.

51:14.072 --> 51:17.405
And please thank Janette for the cash.

51:17.533 --> 51:20.616
Now at least I can buy
candy bars at the commissary.

51:22.288 --> 51:24.244
That sucks. Sorry.

51:24.374 --> 51:26.080
Wish I could bring you
a roast chicken,

51:26.209 --> 51:28.871
some rosemary potatoes,
a nice Shiraz to go with it.

51:30.463 --> 51:32.545
That would be nice.

51:35.051 --> 51:38.669
What does Janette say about
an immigration lawyer?

51:40.890 --> 51:42.391
They're working on it.

51:42.517 --> 51:44.257
The good ones are expensive

51:44.394 --> 51:46.760
and busy these days, so...

51:48.564 --> 51:50.600
Hey, maybe we'll throw you a benefit.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.854
Like a rent party...bail party.

51:53.987 --> 51:56.569
My band. I could write a song for you.

51:56.698 --> 51:58.108
"Free Jacques Jhoni."

51:58.241 --> 52:00.277
Take this administration to task

52:00.410 --> 52:03.698
for their repressive immigration policies, huh?

52:03.830 --> 52:06.742
— What do you think?
- I don't know. Uh...

52:08.167 --> 52:10.658
Sounds good, Davis, but, uh...

52:11.921 --> 52:14.412
maybe you shouldn't mention my name.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.342
Donald is perfect.

52:19.470 --> 52:21.301
He knows the tradition, obviously.

52:21.431 --> 52:24.218
He's at the forefront
of contemporary jazz.

52:24.350 --> 52:25.760
Mac on the keys.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.809
I could play bass on this.

52:28.938 --> 52:31.554
No, we already asked Ron Carter.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.942
Well, he all right, I guess.

52:38.114 --> 52:39.900
(Chuckles) Ron Carter?

52:40.033 --> 52:41.739
Come on now.

52:41.868 --> 52:45.110
— Carl Allen on the drums.
— Can he drum second line?

52:45.246 --> 52:48.158
Carl Allen can drum anything he wants.

52:48.291 --> 52:52.250
A lot of great drummers get lost
when it comes to doing how we do down here.

52:52.378 --> 52:54.494
Daddy, I got the band...

52:55.965 --> 52:59.253
just need you to front the thing,
do the calls and chants.

53:00.970 --> 53:02.551
The record label really wants this.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.513
They've been on me about
a New Orleans album ever since the storm.

53:05.641 --> 53:08.553
There's gonna be a real advance.
Money for me, money for you to start here,

53:08.686 --> 53:10.893
get an electrician in,

53:11.022 --> 53:12.512
or seal up the roof.

53:14.359 --> 53:16.350
Yeah, you know, it could work...

53:16.486 --> 53:17.817
if I did it.

53:21.324 --> 53:23.656
You know, too bad you ain't Indian.

53:24.744 --> 53:27.030
Say what now? What d'you mean?

53:27.163 --> 53:29.745
I mean you ain't masked
since you was 15.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.739
Oh, for the love of God.

53:31.876 --> 53:35.710
You think I'm—a let you do this with the tradition
and you ain't part of the tradition?

53:36.547 --> 53:40.210
It's one thing for y'all to try out
something like this if you're part of us,

53:40.343 --> 53:41.833
if you're like me or like Donald.

53:42.678 --> 53:46.170
You know, Mac been around it
for years, but you...

53:46.766 --> 53:48.176
Fine, fine.

53:48.309 --> 53:51.051
I promise I'll start sewing right now,
God damn it.

53:51.187 --> 53:53.394
OK? I'll start sewing tonight.

53:53.523 --> 53:56.890
You mask next year, then we'll see.

53:57.026 --> 53:58.732
Daddy.

53:58.861 --> 54:01.819
Daddy, the record label
wants this record now, not next year.

54:01.948 --> 54:03.734
If you don't do it, then...

54:06.744 --> 54:07.904
(Snaps fingers)

54:13.167 --> 54:15.203
..I'II just get somebody else to do it.

54:15.336 --> 54:16.542
Another big chief.

54:17.088 --> 54:19.420
Little Walter. Hm?

54:19.549 --> 54:21.961
— Monk Boudreaux.
— Monk, huh?

54:22.844 --> 54:27.304
- You got a problem with Monk?
— No, Monk is great. So is Walter.

54:27.432 --> 54:29.013
— I'm just saying...
— What you saying?

54:30.393 --> 54:33.430
They uptown. Now, you want this to sound
like the Guardians of the Flame

54:33.563 --> 54:36.396
or do you want it to sound like
Creole Wild West or Golden Eagles?

54:39.902 --> 54:41.642
— The Guardians.
— Well, then.

54:46.576 --> 54:48.817
Most folks won't know the difference,
but we will.

54:48.953 --> 54:52.286
- Well, if you don't do it...
— I ain't say I'm not gonna do it.

54:52.415 --> 54:54.121
You didn't say you were
gonna do it neither.

54:54.250 --> 54:56.707
I got to know it's right first.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.258

55:52.099 --> 55:53.430
Well...

55:54.644 --> 55:56.134
You ready?

55:57.188 --> 55:58.177
(Laughs)

55:58.314 --> 56:00.771
— Oh God.
— Come on, it's now or never.

56:08.908 --> 56:12.696
