01:52.879 --> 01:56.315
That brings us now to our final
team, ladies and gentlemen.

01:56.382 --> 01:59.977
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chutes.

02:00.053 --> 02:03.284
These could be our 1993
champion team ropers.

02:06.025 --> 02:09.324
Our boys are just about ready. Keep
your eyes right on the roping chute.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.762
Sonny makes
a good head catch.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.393
Now Pepper rides in, throws
it down, goes to the horn...

02:16.469 --> 02:19.233
they turn and face,
and the time is in!

02:19.305 --> 02:23.264
Checking our official timers.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.174
How 'bout a 5.4!

02:25.245 --> 02:29.875
Ladies and gentlemen, that might be good
enough to win the state championship!

02:29.949 --> 02:35.683
The 1993 New Mexico
State Champion Team Ropers...

02:35.755 --> 02:38.383
Sonny Gilstrap and Pepper Lewis.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.392
Good goin', boys!

02:40.460 --> 02:42.792
- Thank you!

04:13.186 --> 04:15.450
Hey, Carlos.
How ya doin'?

04:15.521 --> 04:18.820
- Mr. Stark.
- Hey, stuff looks nice.

04:18.891 --> 04:20.825
Looks really nice.

04:23.029 --> 04:26.055
Look, there's some money
missing from petty cash.

04:26.132 --> 04:28.828
- You know anything about it?
- Uh, uh, no, sin'.

04:28.901 --> 04:33.167
Right. All right.
I just thought I'd ask around.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.906
It's good to see you,
Carlos.

04:42.982 --> 04:47.112
You steal from me, and then you
lie to me about it in my face?

04:47.186 --> 04:50.246
Did you take my money?

04:50.323 --> 04:52.791
- Yes! Yes!
- Good! That's what I like to hear.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.987
That's what I like
to hear. Now...

04:56.062 --> 05:00.396
you pay me back, and I won't
add the amount to your debt.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.764
- All right?
- Mr. Stark.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.327
El Señor Huerta's downstain's.
He's by the docks.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.607
What the hell is he
doin' down here?

05:38.771 --> 05:41.467
Manny. Havert seen you
down here in a while.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.509
- John, I don't like this.
- What?

05:43.576 --> 05:45.510
No, no. Look at
this old woman.

05:45.578 --> 05:48.843
She won't live
long enough to work off her debt.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.247
That's why I came
down here tonight.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.308
I have been getting
complaints, John.

05:53.386 --> 05:57.482
Manny, you know it's not an exact system.
We don't always get what we expect.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.793
Qué pasa?
Buscas a alguien?

06:04.864 --> 06:06.798
Dónde está mi papa?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.300
- Quién?
- Mi papá.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.202
Tú vaya con el grupo
primero, okay?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.277
She says she wants
her father.

06:27.353 --> 06:30.618
- What is she talking about?
- Manny, I don't know.

06:30.690 --> 06:34.854
Am I supposed to be personally responsible
for everybody that comes off that boat?

06:35.762 --> 06:39.129
Look, I'll call our people
on the other side...

06:39.198 --> 06:42.031
and I'll
handle this, okay?

06:43.302 --> 06:46.396
Make sure you do that.
All right?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.445
Bueno.

06:53.513 --> 06:57.882
Bienvenidos a los
Estados Unidos de América.

06:58.184 --> 07:01.312
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
let's put our hands together...

07:01.387 --> 07:05.289

Melba Van Buren!

07:11.164 --> 07:13.997
We're gonna

07:14.066 --> 07:17.092
if we can get these two clowns
out of the arena.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.229
I don't know what
they're doin' out there...

07:19.305 --> 07:21.239
but if they're
not careful...

07:34.687 --> 07:37.781
Well, lookee what
the cat drug in.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.519
Hey, Melba. Lookin'

07:40.593 --> 07:44.996
Mm-mm-mm.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.859

- Well, here's mine, boys.

07:49.936 --> 07:51.870
- You all gonna wish me luck?
- Shit!

07:51.938 --> 07:54.805
You fellas gonna be cryin'
all the way home tonight.

07:54.874 --> 07:58.071
- What's the deal here, boys?
- Hundred bucks a man.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.841
- One ride, winner takes all. Just the same as always.
- You in, Pepper?

08:01.914 --> 08:04.815
Hobby horse have
a hickory dick? 'Course I'm in.

08:04.884 --> 08:08.411
Bullshit, Pepper. I ain't ridin'
to win no I.O.U. From you.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.286
Yeah, Pepper, you can
keep your damn old I.O.U.

08:11.357 --> 08:14.690
That there's good as gold.
When you know me not to pay my debt?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.456
Shit! When we know you
to pay 'em?

08:17.530 --> 08:19.464
Hell, you still owe me
from last April.

08:19.532 --> 08:23.127
April? Hell, he still owes me
ten bucks from high school.

08:23.202 --> 08:26.660
You didn't get my check,
Eddie? I sent it U.P.S.

08:26.739 --> 08:30.197
You never. You're a lyin'
little son of a bitch, Pepper.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.809
- Who you callin' "little," asshole?
- You,

08:36.883 --> 08:38.874
you little son of a bitch!

08:38.951 --> 08:42.386
He throws his hands in the ain'.
Get away from him, cowboy!

08:42.455 --> 08:44.889
The time is in
for Mike Ray.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.983
The time is
nine seconds flat!

08:48.060 --> 08:50.585
Let him ride.

08:50.663 --> 08:54.030
Yeah, Sonny. What the hell.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.000
Let him ride.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.038
Sonny.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.536
Sonny. Ho! Wait up!

09:06.112 --> 09:08.945
Thanks, man. You just saved Eddie
about four teeth back there.

09:09.015 --> 09:12.109
You win that prize money tonight,
you're payin' off all your debts.

09:12.184 --> 09:16.177
You understand me? Otherwise, it's
gonna be me kickin' your ass tonight.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.452
Oh, yeah? Why don't you just
try kickin' it right now, okay?

09:19.525 --> 09:22.756
Be better than this Eskimo treatment
you been givin' me all year long.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.228
You heard me, Pepper.

09:29.936 --> 09:32.530
Luke Short, Jim Wilshin'e,
our next team out.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.800
Luke rides up, makes
a nice, quick head catch.

09:34.874 --> 09:38.241
Now Jim's gotta ride in.
Throws it down, go to the horn.

09:38.311 --> 09:41.246
Turn and face, and the time...
- Chili Pepper.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.782
Nacho.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.874
Good to see you, man.

09:45.952 --> 09:49.115
- Cómo estás?
- Where the hell have you been?

09:49.188 --> 09:51.588
Oh, I been with
the worms in Mexico.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.956
- Ay, Chihuahua!
- I miss your cookin'.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.364
You talk to Sonny?

09:59.432 --> 10:02.401
Come on, Pepper.
Sonny will forgive you.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.402
Oh, yeah? When?

10:04.470 --> 10:08.065
That rodeo was a year ago.
He ain't said six words to me since.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.267
I told him I was sorry.
What's he want?

10:10.343 --> 10:13.437
Sonny don't care about words.
You have to show him.

10:13.512 --> 10:16.675
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna kiss his ass,
if that's what you mean.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.650
So sour, probably tastes like
a damn old lemon anyhow.

10:19.719 --> 10:23.655
Don't give up on him. You've
been friends too long for that.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.750
Yeah, well, I had a reason for
not showin' up at that rodeo.

10:27.827 --> 10:31.263
Tell him what it was.
He will understand.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.822
Maybe someday, when he ain't bein'
such a damn shit-ass.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.528
- Buena suerte.
- Thanks, viejo.

10:37.603 --> 10:41.061
- Good luck on your ride.
- I don't need luck. I need sleep.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.370
Senoritas.

10:43.442 --> 10:46.172
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm single.

10:53.185 --> 10:56.621
- Pepper's still trying to make up, huh?
- Yeah, well, I ain't listenin'.

10:56.689 --> 10:59.123
He's your friend.

10:59.191 --> 11:03.753
You two guys should be out there chasing
that steer together right now.

11:03.829 --> 11:08.323
Friend don't pull a no-show at a national
rodeo final, Nacho. Not in my book.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.733
I had plans for that money.
You know that.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.996
Nothing in your book
about forgiving?

11:14.073 --> 11:16.541
Nacho, Pepper and I
are through, okay?

11:16.609 --> 11:20.511
You got a heart the size
of a tiny raisin, you know that?

11:20.579 --> 11:22.570
Why don't you just
hand me my bronc rein?

11:22.648 --> 11:25.344
If you only knew
what it was to be alone...

11:25.418 --> 11:27.352
you would treasure
your friend.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.354
Where you goin'?

11:29.422 --> 11:32.357
- Home. I'm going home.
- You're not gonna stay and watch me ride?

11:32.425 --> 11:36.191
No. You're a hardheaded donkey with
a heart the size of a tiny raisin,

11:36.262 --> 11:39.231
and I don't want
to watch you ride.

11:39.298 --> 11:42.756
You better have a pot of coffee
waitin' for me when I get home.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.429
Next cowboy out this afternoon...

12:12.498 --> 12:16.298
Sonny Gilstrap
from Belen, New Mexico.

12:16.368 --> 12:19.235
High Dive is the name of the bucking
horse he's drawn this afternoon.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.399
Easy, boy. I got him. I got him.

12:30.116 --> 12:34.109
There we go. There we go.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.245
There we go.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.950
Seventy-five's the score
the cowboy's tryin' to beat...

12:39.024 --> 12:42.585
to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.285
An excellent ride for Sonny Gilstrap.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.352
This could be
a high score.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.761
Hard to beat
that one.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.663
Maybe for you.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.430
- Shit.
Seventy-seven points...

13:24.503 --> 13:28.371
for that cowboy!

13:31.944 --> 13:35.573
Let's move up to chute number five.
Keep your eyes right there.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.776
Pepper Lewis, Belen, New Mexico,
is gonna be our next cowboy.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.376
Lone Star is the name
of the bucking horse he's drawn.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.887
- This cowboy's gotta do better than 77 points...
- Okay now.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.153
If he wants to take the lead in
the bronc riding this afternoon.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.353
Take it easy now.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.139
He's just about ready.

14:01.207 --> 14:02.970
Say when, buddy.

14:03.042 --> 14:06.239
Lemme have the old hammerheaded
son of a bitch.

14:38.310 --> 14:42.076
Damn! Well, there
goes our money.

14:42.147 --> 14:46.015
- Hope to hell you're happy.
- God, I hate that little peckerwood!

14:46.085 --> 14:48.019
You oughta not let him
in the jackpot, Sonny.

14:48.087 --> 14:52.888
That old Pepper sure can cowboy,
can't he? When he wants to.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.429
The judges signal:

14:57.496 --> 15:00.124
Seventy-nine points
for the cowboy!

15:00.199 --> 15:02.099
Seventy-nine!

15:39.872 --> 15:41.806
Hello?

15:43.142 --> 15:45.076
Yes, this is
Nacho Salazar.

15:47.212 --> 15:51.740
What? Teresa? My daughter
Teresa is in New York City?

15:51.817 --> 15:53.944
God's blessing on you,
Señor Stark.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.953
I'll go get her right away.

15:56.021 --> 16:00.788
Good, good. And please make sure you
bring the other $5,000 with you.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.953
Five thousand? But I
already paid, Señor Stark.

16:04.029 --> 16:06.520
That's what I thought too,
but the people I work for...

16:06.598 --> 16:09.362
said you agreed to pay
another 5,000 on delivery.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.199
No, no, no. That was
not the agreement.

16:12.271 --> 16:14.501
Well, look, I could
try talking to them...

16:14.573 --> 16:16.507
but I don't think
it would do any good.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.806
- Maybe we could go to the police.
- Wait a second, Mr. Salazar.

16:19.878 --> 16:23.405
Think about what you're saying. Your
daughter is in this country illegally.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.313
Yes, of course.
You're right.

16:25.384 --> 16:28.444
All these people are interested
is in the money.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.479
- And all you care about is your daughter.
- But what can I do?

16:32.558 --> 16:36.016
Is there any way
you can get the money?

16:37.730 --> 16:41.166
Yes, I think I can get it.

16:41.233 --> 16:45.192
- Good, good.
- How can I get in touch with you?

16:45.270 --> 16:50.173
My number's 212-555-4320.
You got that?

16:50.242 --> 16:52.176
Yes, I have it.

16:52.244 --> 16:56.044
Señor Stark, my daughter,
is she okay?

16:56.115 --> 16:59.516
She's fine. Just think,
in a couple of days...

16:59.585 --> 17:01.610
you two will be
together again.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.621
Good night,
Mr. Salazar.

17:37.589 --> 17:41.821
"Dear Sonny. Praise God, my daughter
Teresa is out of Cuba.

17:41.894 --> 17:45.330
I've gone to New York City
to pick her up.

17:45.397 --> 17:49.458
I will telephone you as soon
as possible about your guns.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.527
Forgive me. I did not
know what else to do. "

17:56.141 --> 17:58.439
"P.S. Here's
your damn coffee. "

18:06.251 --> 18:08.185
Where are you, Big Chief?

18:12.057 --> 18:14.924
Now, where are you?

18:16.328 --> 18:21.231
I don't wanna play if you
ain't gonna play fain'. Oh!

18:21.300 --> 18:25.498
Big Chief on
trail of naked paleface woman.

18:25.571 --> 18:28.938
Oh. Oh, no.

18:29.007 --> 18:33.842
What are you gonna do when you find
naked paleface woman, Big Chief?

18:33.912 --> 18:38.849
Big Chief gonna teach naked
paleface woman to play his tom-tom.

18:38.917 --> 18:42.944
- Is much fun for Big Chief.
- Oh, no. Not that.

18:43.021 --> 18:46.149
Oh!

18:46.225 --> 18:49.854
Oh. Big Chief.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.431
Now time for
naked paleface woman...

18:53.499 --> 18:56.263
to make Big Chief
happy chief.

18:57.669 --> 19:01.935
Oh. Why, you wicked
old heathen!

19:06.011 --> 19:07.535
Pepper?

19:07.613 --> 19:09.638
Pepper?

19:18.690 --> 19:22.148
Sonny?
Hey, how ya doin'?

19:22.227 --> 19:25.560
Got any of that prize money
left over from the other night?

19:25.631 --> 19:28.464
- Sure. Why?
- Need to borrow it.

19:28.534 --> 19:32.197
- How come?
- None of your business. You gonna loan it to me?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.170
- Yeah. How much you need?
- How much you got?

19:36.241 --> 19:38.505
Just one minute.
I'll check.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.214
- Hey, Sonny.
- Melba.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.314
Big Chief
catch you yet?

19:52.391 --> 19:55.724
He just about
had me when you drove up.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.853
You wanna play?

19:59.464 --> 20:01.398
No, thanks.

20:01.466 --> 20:04.697
You used to like
to play, remember?

20:04.770 --> 20:07.261
- Yeah, well, you're
a married woman now, Melba.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.500
That don't bother
Pepper none.

20:09.575 --> 20:12.874
Yeah, well,
not much does, does it?

20:16.648 --> 20:20.345
Oh, hey. Keep the wigwam
warm for me, baby.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.478
Mmm.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.887
I will return.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.432
Where the hell you
think you're goin'?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.229
You tell me.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.702
You sure as hell ain't
goin' nowhere with me.

20:39.771 --> 20:41.762
- Where you goin'?
- New York City.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.298
New York City? What the hell's
in New York City?

20:45.377 --> 20:47.004
- Nacho.
- Nacho?

20:47.079 --> 20:50.048
He was supposed to pick up his daughter
and call me. That was five days ago.

20:50.115 --> 20:53.050
- You reckon he run into trouble?
- I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

20:53.118 --> 20:56.053
- Let's get goin'.
- I said, you ain't goin' nowhere with me.

20:58.123 --> 21:01.889
- You might need my help.
- I counted on your help once before, remember?

21:01.960 --> 21:04.053
You gonna loan me
that money or not?

21:04.129 --> 21:06.063
You want my money,
not me, is that it?

21:06.131 --> 21:10.329
- That's it.
- Well, my money goes where I go, you know that?

21:10.402 --> 21:13.496
- You go where your money goes, is that a fact?
- Yessin'ee, that's a fact.

21:13.572 --> 21:16.405
- I'm a businessman.
- Well, Mr. Businessman, guess what?

21:16.475 --> 21:20.411
You and your money can both
get the hell outta my truck...

21:20.479 --> 21:22.413
'cause I don't want
either one of you now.

21:23.915 --> 21:26.042
Okay.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.382
I'd rather play
Big Chief anyhow!

21:28.453 --> 21:31.183
Good.
Don't slam the door.

21:34.059 --> 21:38.291
And another thing... I wouldn't throw a
bucket of water on your ass if it was drownin'!

21:38.363 --> 21:40.957
Good. I wouldn't
want you to neither!

21:43.502 --> 21:46.938
Pepper! Get out!

21:47.005 --> 21:50.031
Nacho's my friend!
I'm goin' to help him, not you!

21:50.108 --> 21:52.099
Get out.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.481
Aaah!

22:02.988 --> 22:06.617
Okay. You wanna go? You can go, but
you're ridin' back here, you understand me?

22:06.692 --> 22:10.992
- I swear to God, you are not getting up front with me.
- Not polite to swear to God.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.759
Oh, God! Hey!

22:14.833 --> 22:19.031
- Sonny... Shit!

22:39.491 --> 22:41.982
- Hey.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.756
- Hey!

22:46.465 --> 22:48.763
I told you, Pepper,
you ain't ridin' up front with me.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.565
I don't wanna get up front. I'm just
curious what the hell's goin' on.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.902
All I know is Nacho's been payin' this
guy for the last couple years...

22:55.974 --> 22:57.999
to get his daughter
outta Cuba.

22:58.076 --> 23:01.045
When I got home, there was a note sayin'
she was in New York City...

23:01.113 --> 23:03.013
and he'd gone
to get her.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.606
Nacho must've been hot to get there
if he left before you got home.

23:05.684 --> 23:08.482
Wouldrt you be if someone snuck
your daughter outta Cuba?

23:08.553 --> 23:11.215
I wouldn't let
my daughter go to Cuba.

23:11.289 --> 23:13.519
She didn't go to Cuba.
She was born there.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.617
She never been
nowhere else.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.662
Always somethin'.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.663
You gotta give 'em
one thing, though.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.790
Them Cubans make
a damn fine cigar.

24:00.605 --> 24:04.803
- Okay, goddamn it, you can ride up front with me...

24:04.876 --> 24:07.845
but I don't want you yappin'
my ear off, you understand me?

24:08.980 --> 24:10.948
Peculiar how things
work out, ain't it?

24:11.016 --> 24:13.507
I mean, one minute,
I'm playin' Big Chief.

24:13.585 --> 24:17.021
Next minute, I'm on my way
to New York City.

24:17.088 --> 24:22.025
One day, never been east of Tulsa.
Next day, boom! I'm east of Tulsa.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.822
Peculiar.

24:23.895 --> 24:26.193
Yeah. Woo, woo, woo, woo.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.165
You believe in hypnotism?

24:29.234 --> 24:31.361
I can hypnotize you
while you're drivin'...

24:31.436 --> 24:33.927
only it's probably not good
to do while you're drivin'.

24:37.776 --> 24:42.736
This old boy... has got this
dead-drunk horse passed out in his bed.

24:42.814 --> 24:46.045
So old Tug, who's pretty well
shit-faced himself...

24:46.117 --> 24:48.312
takes one look at
this horse and says...

24:48.386 --> 24:50.445
I don't care
what old Tug says.

24:50.522 --> 24:55.050
I don't care what you say. You been
sayin' it for the last 24 hours straight.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.856
- You don't wanna hear the rest of the story?
- No, I don't!

24:57.929 --> 25:00.193
I don't wanna hear you
talk no more!

25:00.265 --> 25:02.733
- You don't wanna hear me talk no more?
- That's right.

25:02.801 --> 25:07.864
- Okay. That's the way you want it, fine. No more talkin'.
- Good.

25:22.454 --> 25:25.912
Pepper, how far did that sign
say it was to the interstate?

25:43.742 --> 25:46.176
So where you wanna eat?

25:57.989 --> 25:59.923
Okay, Pepper,
finish your damn story.

25:59.991 --> 26:02.687
So Tug takes one look
at this horse and says...

26:02.761 --> 26:06.788
"Well, she ain't pretty, but I wouldn't
kick her outta bed for eatin' oats. "

26:12.537 --> 26:14.471
Oh, Lordy.

26:17.943 --> 26:20.377
Good to be talkin' again.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.646
- Sonny?
- Yeah.

26:29.187 --> 26:31.121
Big, ain't it?

26:31.189 --> 26:33.123
Yeah.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.650
Whoo! Yeah!

26:59.718 --> 27:01.811
Boy, I like this city.

27:03.888 --> 27:06.152
You ever heard such
a racket in your life?

27:06.224 --> 27:08.454
- Huh?
- You ever heard such a...

27:08.526 --> 27:10.756
Forget it.

27:10.829 --> 27:14.356
Hey, how we supposed to track down
Nacho in all this madness?

27:14.432 --> 27:17.265
He left a New York number
on the desktop.

27:17.335 --> 27:20.361
Called it up. Turns out it's
this place called "La Habanita. "

27:20.438 --> 27:22.702
- Little Havana.
- That's right.

27:22.774 --> 27:26.972
So I called 'em up and asked if a Cuban
named Nacho Salazar had been there.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.036
- You know what that bastard did to me?
- What?

27:29.114 --> 27:30.706
He hung up.

27:30.782 --> 27:34.809
I wish I knew his name.
I'd whup his rude ass for ya.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.988
Hey! You know where
Club La Habanita is?

27:49.734 --> 27:53.795
- What'd he say?
- Wa-hee, wa-hee, wa-canna?

27:53.872 --> 27:57.364
- Italian, huh?
- I believe so.

27:58.977 --> 28:00.911
This one's gone.

28:00.979 --> 28:03.846
- The L's are gone from this one.
- Must be a phone book thief on the loose.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.008
I'll try information.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.119
Oh, here.
This works.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.631
Howdy. Hey.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.336
Operator said it was
on Perez Street. Right there.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.970
- One last little piece.
- Goddamn it, Pepper!

28:35.046 --> 28:37.037
You're rippin' out
all my ear hain's.

28:37.115 --> 28:41.108
That'll teach ya not to look at
a phone 'fore you stick it to your ear.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.751
There it is.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.762
Operator said Perez.
Looks more like Juarez.

29:08.646 --> 29:10.773
You two goin' in there?

29:10.849 --> 29:13.374
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes, indeed, sin'.

29:13.451 --> 29:15.715
Why not? Why not?

29:15.787 --> 29:17.846
Why not?

29:17.922 --> 29:21.414
Fella there's about three bricks
shy of a load if you ask me.

29:36.407 --> 29:38.272
Hey, hey.
Dance, senorita?

29:41.246 --> 29:43.214
Come on, Pepper.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.215
Hey. Come on. She likes me.

29:48.052 --> 29:51.180
There's a huge warehouse
in Newark. It's in probate.

29:51.256 --> 29:53.315
You could put
300 workers in there.

29:53.391 --> 29:56.121
Hell, it's big enough
to let 'em live there.

29:56.194 --> 29:58.822
- How much?
- Quarter of a million.

29:58.897 --> 30:01.457
You gotta be kiddin' me.
I know a guy downtown...

30:01.533 --> 30:04.798
who can get us that same kind of space
for half that price.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.374
- Howdy.
- Hola.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.740
Can I have a whiskey
and a beer, please?

30:13.812 --> 30:16.838
Yeah, a beer and a mescal.
Hold the lime, hold the lemon.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.681
It's a mighty nice
place you got here.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.381
Hell of a nice place.
Friend told us about it.

30:24.455 --> 30:28.687
He was here the other night. Maybe you
remember him. A guy named Nacho Salazar.

30:28.760 --> 30:33.891
Chubby fella about yea tall. Come here
from New Mexico to fetch his daughter.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.896
Guess not.

30:40.972 --> 30:43.406
Sonny, I'd like
to make a toast.

30:43.474 --> 30:46.272
We, uh, spent a little time apart
over the past year...

30:46.344 --> 30:48.972
but it's nice to just
be back... Okay.

30:51.249 --> 30:53.513
Mm. Ohh!

31:03.294 --> 31:05.262
Howdy.

31:05.330 --> 31:09.096
Hey, man, por qué tú no
yippee-hi-yay pa' fuera, huh?

31:10.235 --> 31:12.226
Sonny, I don't think
this fella likes us.

31:12.303 --> 31:16.239
Yeah, well, don't go causing no trouble.
Probably just don't speak English. Howdy.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.332
Speak English?

31:18.409 --> 31:21.242
Sabe English?

31:21.312 --> 31:24.008
Well, that's too bad,
'cause I was gonna tell you...

31:24.082 --> 31:27.609
your face looks like a hatful of
assholes.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.960
Sonny, did you see what
this pukehead just did?

31:36.027 --> 31:38.894
Yeah, well, maybe if you werert bein'
so rude. Try a little politeness.

31:38.963 --> 31:42.194
- "Politeness"?
- Politeness. We're in the city now.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.861
Okay. Politeness.

31:46.471 --> 31:49.634
Uh, sin', I apologize
for my rude behavior.

31:49.707 --> 31:52.574
I don't know what came
over me. Bartender?

31:52.644 --> 31:56.080
Could I get a beer
for my new friend here?

31:57.482 --> 32:00.007
See, a little common courtesy goes
a long way, Pepper.

32:00.084 --> 32:03.212
Amazin', ain't it?
Oh, here's your beer.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.658
Goddamn it, Pepper!

32:22.807 --> 32:24.399
Howdy.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.150
Sonny!

32:45.730 --> 32:47.459
Y tus sombreros
de mierdas!

32:51.169 --> 32:53.103
Thanks for breakin'
my fall.

32:53.171 --> 32:55.105
Here's your hat.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.936
- Why not? Why not?
- Here's your hat.

32:57.008 --> 33:01.445
Well, now you know why not.
Eh, gringos?

33:01.512 --> 33:03.571
Let's get out of here.

33:08.219 --> 33:11.052
- Te llamo mañana.
- Pronto, huh?

33:11.122 --> 33:13.056
Okay.

33:16.794 --> 33:20.195
- What was all that about?
- I don't know. I'll find out, though.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.198
You better take off.
We could get some cops.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.667
John, uh... You were
out of line earlier.

33:25.737 --> 33:29.229
I'm sorry, Manny.
I just...

33:29.307 --> 33:31.673
I just don't want this guy
tryin' to rip you off.

33:31.743 --> 33:34.803
This guy is a friend
of mine for 30 years.

33:34.879 --> 33:39.578
Who was it always told me about
mixing business and friendship?

33:42.820 --> 33:44.811
Always watching
my back, eh, John?

33:44.889 --> 33:47.858
Yeah, Manny, I am.

33:47.925 --> 33:49.893
Always.

33:59.437 --> 34:02.406
- Who were they?
- Two cowboys from New Mexico.

34:02.473 --> 34:04.668
They're looking for
that old Cuban.

34:05.777 --> 34:07.711
How much do they know?

34:07.779 --> 34:09.974
They know he was here
looking for his daughter.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.982
I don't think they
know nothing else.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.143
We made sure
they won't be back.

34:14.217 --> 34:17.016
Oh, you did, huh?
I hope you're right.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.217
Ow. Boy. Hell of a town.

34:21.292 --> 34:26.456
- Ain't been here five minutes, already got our asses whupped.
- Thanks to you.

34:26.531 --> 34:29.398
Here. Take a bite
of this pepper.

34:29.467 --> 34:30.900
Go ahead.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.869
Cures what ails ya.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.270
At least we know someone
in there knows somethin'.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.534
- You figure?
- Hell, yeah.

34:38.609 --> 34:43.308
Second I mentioned Nacho's name, we got them
two damn gorillas standin' right next to us.

34:48.018 --> 34:51.887
- So what now?
- We find us a motel and sleep on it, I reckon.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.987
Oh, hey. Hook a left.
That looks like a motel right there.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.743
A bit uptown for us,
ain't it, Pepper?

35:16.814 --> 35:19.749
Don't worry about a thing.
You're my guest.

35:30.061 --> 35:33.360
- Howdy do?
- Hidy what?

35:33.431 --> 35:35.626
Hidy... He... Hello.

35:38.402 --> 35:40.597
Uh, welcome to the Waldorf.
May I help you?

35:40.671 --> 35:45.768
Yeah. Uh, me and my partner could use
a couple beds. We just blew into town.

35:45.843 --> 35:49.472
- We ain't from around here.
- Really?

35:49.547 --> 35:51.879
Um, just fill this out.

35:51.949 --> 35:56.045
Right away. Fill that out, will ya,
Sonny? I'll take care of the finances.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.054
Okay.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.856
You're a real cowboy,
aren't you?

36:01.926 --> 36:04.292
Been accused of it
a time or two, ma'am.

36:07.365 --> 36:10.198
Well, hell, yeah,
we're real cowboys.

36:10.268 --> 36:12.202
What the hell?

36:12.270 --> 36:14.864
Damn!

36:17.408 --> 36:19.205
Well,
there you go.

36:19.277 --> 36:21.711
Little piece of New Mexico
right there.

36:21.779 --> 36:24.714
Hey, uh, you know,
we were thinkin' maybe later...

36:24.782 --> 36:27.683
to go to a museum,
maybe take in an opera or two.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.913
How's that sound to you?

36:29.987 --> 36:32.478
Will this be cash
or credit card, sin'?

36:34.091 --> 36:36.491
Personal check, if you
don't mind, little darlin'.

36:40.431 --> 36:42.695
I can't believe
she didn't take my damn check.

36:42.767 --> 36:45.827
You ain't got no account. I don't know
why you didn't just pay cash.

36:45.903 --> 36:49.270
Cash? After she insulted me
like that? Hell, no.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.308
At least we can get
a bite while we're here.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.309
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

36:56.347 --> 36:59.407
And how would you gentlemen
like those steaks prepared?

36:59.483 --> 37:01.508
"Prepared"?
Oh, you mean cooked.

37:01.586 --> 37:05.522
Yes, sin'. "Cooked" is most definitely what
I should have said. Do excuse me, please.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.888
How would you like
those steaks cooked?

37:07.959 --> 37:12.453
Well, just knock its horns off, wipe its
nasty old ass, and chunk it down on the plate.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.760
Same for me, please.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.697
I will give chef
your instructions exactly.

37:16.767 --> 37:19.827
And would you care
to order wine with your meal?

37:19.904 --> 37:23.101
Uh, yeah. Why don't you bring us
a bottle of somethin'-or-other?

37:23.174 --> 37:25.233
Uh, not too sweet.
American.

37:25.309 --> 37:29.109
American something-or-other.
Yes, sin'. An excellent choice.

37:29.180 --> 37:33.981
And would you like to have glasses, or do
you prefer to drink din'ectly from the bottle?

37:35.052 --> 37:37.816
Well, uh, glasses, I reckon.

37:37.888 --> 37:41.255
Oh, and hey, toss a little ice
in mine if you would, my good man.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.590
Ice. Certainly, sin'.
Nothing could surprise me now.

37:44.662 --> 37:49.565
Hey, tell that cook he better not screw up
them steaks. We're particular about our meat.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.304
Thank you, Pepper.

38:07.985 --> 38:11.546
I hope you enjoy this bottle as much
as you did the previous two.

38:31.208 --> 38:32.641
Mmm. Hmm.

38:32.710 --> 38:36.441
I been thinkin'. We got
but one choice tomorrow.

38:36.514 --> 38:40.473
I think we oughta boot on over
to the police station.

38:40.551 --> 38:42.519
Let them
handle it.

38:44.722 --> 38:46.713
I must say...

38:46.791 --> 38:49.123
they've done a fine job
with this steak.

38:50.795 --> 38:54.492
I don't understand why they
gift-wrap these little lemons...

38:54.565 --> 38:56.829
but the steak
is mighty tasty.

38:58.869 --> 39:02.361
For all we know, Nacho
could've gotten drunk...

39:02.440 --> 39:05.068
and thrown in jail.

39:05.142 --> 39:09.203
It don't really matter.
Fin'st thing in the morning...

39:09.280 --> 39:12.374
we'll make our way over to the police
station, let them handle this.

39:12.450 --> 39:14.475
That's what they
get paid for.

39:17.321 --> 39:20.347
This little secret. We don't
have to tell her right now.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.929
What do you think?

39:35.106 --> 39:37.904
- Jesus Christ, Pepper!
- Ow!

39:37.975 --> 39:40.705
We're in New York City.
That shit don't fly around here.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.372
Whoa!
Would you please...

39:47.251 --> 39:49.913
Just to come
for a fitting.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.387
Will there be
anything else?

39:52.456 --> 39:54.856
Yeah, you got any,
uh, popsicles?

39:54.925 --> 39:56.859
Popsicles.
No, sin'.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.657
Well, I guess
that'll be all, then.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.698
Thank you.

40:01.766 --> 40:04.530
Thank you.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.536
That was wonderful.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.732
- Well, shall we?
- Of course.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.714
- Gentlemen.
- Margarette.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.664
Sonny, take a gander at this.
Tell me what it says.

40:38.202 --> 40:41.899
"Tuesday, 9 p. m. 50 Central
Park South. Top floor. "

40:43.374 --> 40:45.433
"I must see you again.
Margarette. "

40:47.978 --> 40:50.742
Whew. Well, kiss
a duck's red ass.

40:50.815 --> 40:53.113
I do believe she loves me.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.010
I'll be right back.

40:59.890 --> 41:01.858
That amazes me.

41:01.926 --> 41:03.894
That truly amazes me.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.662
I'm beginnin' to like
this town, you know.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.475
- Well, it's time to go.
- Hmm?

41:23.781 --> 41:26.875
- Stop touching me, Pepper!
- Hey, get down.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.782
- Them people think we skipped the check.
- They think right.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.883
- Well, bullshit. Pay 'em.
- With what?

41:35.960 --> 41:38.121
You lyin' son of a bitch.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.527
You told me you still had some of
that prize money left.

41:40.598 --> 41:43.431
- I do. I wouldn't lie to you.
- Well, how much you got?

41:43.501 --> 41:46.265
About eight bucks,
I reckon.

41:46.337 --> 41:50.364
- "Eight bucks, I reckon. "
- Better than a poke in the eye, ain't it?

41:51.408 --> 41:53.342
Pepper, I've had it with you.

42:10.961 --> 42:13.259
Ah! Ooh!

42:15.633 --> 42:19.228
Ah. Don't worry.
Things will get better.

42:20.771 --> 42:23.239
Only when my father comes.

42:23.307 --> 42:26.936
You have to face the fact
that maybe your father isn't coming.

42:27.011 --> 42:29.571
He is coming.

42:29.647 --> 42:31.740
Back to work!

42:33.150 --> 42:35.175
I said, back to work.

42:35.252 --> 42:37.584
Where is my father?

42:37.655 --> 42:39.589
- Let go of me!
- Juan!

42:39.657 --> 42:41.591
Déjala quieta.

42:46.497 --> 42:50.194
- Are you okay?
- No.

42:50.267 --> 42:52.735
There's a sink
in the other room.

42:52.803 --> 42:56.398
Let's go in there and
wash that off, all right?

42:56.473 --> 42:59.101
We'll take care of this.
Come on.

42:59.176 --> 43:01.110
Go ahead.

43:07.518 --> 43:11.010
My father was going to
take me to New Mexico...

43:11.088 --> 43:13.079
to work with him
on the ranch.

43:15.059 --> 43:17.687
Where is my father?

43:17.761 --> 43:20.559
- Please tell me.
- I don't know.

43:20.631 --> 43:23.361
I mean, that's the truth.
The last time...

43:23.434 --> 43:26.369
The last time I talked to him, he was
still trying to raise the money...

43:26.437 --> 43:28.803
to pay me for
getting you outta Cuba.

43:28.872 --> 43:30.806
He already paid you.

43:30.874 --> 43:33.638
Yeah, he paid me. He paid me some.

43:33.711 --> 43:35.702
I mean, he didn't
pay me everything.

43:35.779 --> 43:37.770
Please, sit down.

43:40.284 --> 43:43.310
Your father's comin', Teresa.
I mean, I don't know what's keepin' him.

43:44.822 --> 43:48.622
Until he comes, let me
take you outta here.

43:48.692 --> 43:52.025
These people can be very cruel,
as you just saw.

43:52.096 --> 43:55.862
They take advantage of a pretty girl
any chance they get.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.527
I promised your father
I'd take care of you.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.178
What are you gentlemen
doing here?

44:19.256 --> 44:21.486
Just catchin'
a few winks, officer.

44:21.558 --> 44:23.526
For your information,
there's a law...

44:23.594 --> 44:26.028
against camping
in Central Park, and a fine.

44:26.096 --> 44:28.394
I.D.'s, please.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.400
Are you fellas cowboys?

44:33.470 --> 44:36.234
No, we, uh,
criminals, mostly.

44:36.306 --> 44:39.400
You know,
sleep out in parks.

44:39.476 --> 44:42.070
- Bloodthin'sty shit like that.
- Pepper.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.910
Excuse him, officer.
He wasrt raised with any manners.

44:44.982 --> 44:47.746
- Where you guys from, Texas?
- Texas!

44:47.818 --> 44:51.083
There ain't no real cowboys from Texas.
We're from New Mexico.

44:51.155 --> 44:53.817
So what brings you guys
to New York?

44:55.092 --> 44:57.492
- Lookin' for a friend.
- A friend?

44:57.561 --> 45:00.655
He came here about a week ago.
Havert heard from him since.

45:00.731 --> 45:03.393
Thought we'd come check it out
ourselves, you know?

45:05.169 --> 45:08.229
Hey!

45:08.305 --> 45:12.241
Yeah, hey. You better watch it.
She's liable to come up lame on you.

45:13.811 --> 45:16.006
Oh.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.105
Hey, uh, thanks.

45:18.182 --> 45:21.913
Listen, uh, you guys been to
Missing Persons?

45:21.985 --> 45:23.577
No, sin'.

45:23.654 --> 45:26.350
Come on. I'll, uh,
I'll walk you over.

45:27.658 --> 45:30.092
- Thank you very much.
- Maybe they know something.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.220
Ho.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.788
Almost forgot.

45:39.536 --> 45:41.629
Next time you'll be
a little more polite.

45:45.008 --> 45:48.739
I always wanted to be a cowboy myself.
Ridin' the range.

45:48.812 --> 45:51.440
Always wanted to ride
the Chisholm Trail from end to end.

45:51.515 --> 45:55.246
Of course, the only cow I've ever seen
is over in the Central Park Zoo.

45:55.319 --> 45:58.777
- Sign in, then I'll take you down to Missing Persons.
- Thank you very much.

46:01.125 --> 46:02.752
Hey.

46:04.895 --> 46:07.295
You, uh, you ever heard
of Bill Pickett?

46:07.364 --> 46:09.924
- What's that?
- Bill Pickett. He was a cowboy in the Old West.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.595
He pretty much invented bulldogging.
Black man. Like me.

46:13.670 --> 46:16.230
Who told you that?

46:16.306 --> 46:18.240
- It's true.
- Hey.

46:18.308 --> 46:20.242
Sonny, you hear that?

46:20.310 --> 46:22.710
He thinks some old black cowboy
invented bulldogging.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.714
That'd be
Bill Pickett, Pepper.

46:24.782 --> 46:26.716
- Ready?
- Yeah.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.443
Oh, you mean
William Pickett.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.819
Yeah. Oh.

46:33.056 --> 46:35.650
- Age?
- Fifty-five or so.

46:35.726 --> 46:37.489
Social Security number?

46:37.561 --> 46:40.359
I don't even know
if he has one, ma'am.

46:42.099 --> 46:44.465
Any tattoos or
distinguishing marks?

46:46.136 --> 46:48.366
He's got a small scar
over his left eye.

46:48.438 --> 46:51.999
Yeah, I remember that. One night
he got toilet-huggin' drunk...

46:52.075 --> 46:54.475
- Shut up, Pepper.
- Okay.

47:24.942 --> 47:27.911
- That's our friend.
- Goddamn!

47:27.978 --> 47:31.141
- I'm sorry.
- How did it happen?

47:31.215 --> 47:35.515
They found him
in the East River four days ago.

47:35.586 --> 47:38.555
One shot in the head.
His thumbs were tied behind his back.

47:38.622 --> 47:40.214
Oh, Jesus.

47:40.290 --> 47:43.316
We found this
in his shin't pocket.

47:43.393 --> 47:46.328
It's a claim ticket
from a pawn shop.

47:48.232 --> 47:50.166
Listen, uh, let's go
talk to the Chief.

47:50.234 --> 47:52.725
There's nothing more
you can do for him here.

48:00.377 --> 48:02.311
Adiós, my old friend.

48:25.035 --> 48:29.438
They place illegals into domestic work,
prostitution, sweatshops.

48:29.506 --> 48:32.703
There may be 3,000 sweatshops
running in this city alone.

48:32.776 --> 48:35.370
- Goddamn, that's slavery.
- Yeah.

48:35.445 --> 48:38.414
A lot of big cities run on it, whether
anybody wants to admit it or not.

48:38.482 --> 48:41.474
What are you all gonna do about our
friend's daughter, Teresa Salazar?

48:41.551 --> 48:44.543
Look, Mr. Gilstrap, we'll do all
we can to find your friend's daughter.

48:44.621 --> 48:48.717
There's a procedure. Sam will have to file
reports with the I.N.S., the Department of Labor.

48:48.792 --> 48:52.387
It's gonna take time.
You have to be patient.

48:52.462 --> 48:54.726
Damn, who's the law
around here, Sam?

48:59.202 --> 49:02.330
Look, I'm, uh, sorry
I couldn't do more.

49:02.406 --> 49:04.340
I guess I'm
no Bill Pickett.

49:04.408 --> 49:07.605
Yeah, well, not much use
for cowboys these days anyhow.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.908
Look, I'll, uh,
do what I can here.

49:09.980 --> 49:12.448
I'll call you in New Mexico
and keep you posted.

49:12.516 --> 49:14.507
Thanks.

49:29.866 --> 49:32.801
How we supposed to know what
we're lookin' for when we see it?

49:32.869 --> 49:34.302
Lookee there.

49:35.872 --> 49:38.807
It's them
two bastards from last night.

49:40.377 --> 49:42.845
I don't remember seein'
that other guy.

49:42.913 --> 49:45.882
Neither do I, but he sure
as hell looks like the boss to me.

49:45.949 --> 49:49.851
I think we oughta see
what we can find out about that guy.

49:49.920 --> 49:52.354
Okay, I got it.

49:52.422 --> 49:55.721
You go in there and talk to him.
I'll cover the truck.

49:59.296 --> 50:01.321
That's real cowboy
of you, Pepper.

50:01.398 --> 50:03.389
I got a better idea.

50:14.745 --> 50:18.579
Lemme go! Lemme go, lemme go,
lemme go, lemme go! You bully!

50:18.648 --> 50:20.878
Stink factory!

50:20.951 --> 50:23.852
Hey! You settle down,
you ornery little cuss.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.218
Listen here. We wanna
ask you some questions.

50:26.289 --> 50:29.884
- What kinda questions?
- I wanna know about that guy drivin' that fancy car.

50:31.194 --> 50:33.822
I don't know nobody
in no fancy car.

50:33.897 --> 50:36.889
Let's tie some rocks to the peckerwood
and kick him in the river.

50:36.967 --> 50:40.596
- Okay.
- You wouldn't do that to a veteran.

50:40.670 --> 50:43.104
Hell, I'd do it just to see
what it looked like.

50:46.676 --> 50:49.611
So let me get this
straight. These guys smuggle people.

50:49.679 --> 50:52.944
Why? You got somebody you want
smuggled outta someplace?

50:53.016 --> 50:54.950
Answer
the question.

50:55.018 --> 50:59.011
Yeah, Huerta and Stark,
they smuggle people... for a price.

50:59.089 --> 51:03.082
- Who's the boss?
- Huerta's the boss, but Stark does all the legwork.

51:03.160 --> 51:07.187
We got a friend that had somebody
smuggle his daughter outta Cuba.

51:07.264 --> 51:09.789
We were wonderin' maybe you could
tell us where she is.

51:09.866 --> 51:12.198
Now, why would I do that?

51:12.269 --> 51:16.365
Hey, we're the ones askin'
the questions here, bub.

51:16.440 --> 51:19.375
- Why don't we throw him on the spit with the pigeon?
- Okay.

51:19.443 --> 51:24.380
Wait, wait, wait! You just wanna know
where your friend's daughter is, right?

51:24.448 --> 51:27.076
That's right.
And we'll pay you.

51:27.150 --> 51:30.642
- Write you a check.
- Don't take checks.

51:32.489 --> 51:34.753
Twenty bucks.

51:37.727 --> 51:41.288
You get the other half
when you deliver.

51:45.836 --> 51:48.999
Howdy, ma'am.
Hey. How ya doin'?

51:49.072 --> 51:51.006
People so unfriendly here.

51:51.074 --> 51:54.100
It's like talkin' to a bunch of rocks.
Get away from me!

51:54.177 --> 51:56.668
- Pepper, behave yourself.
- He ain't gonna show.

51:56.746 --> 51:58.839
- I only gave him half
a twenty. He'll show.

51:58.915 --> 52:01.349
- Hey! I'm gonna hit him.
- Pepper.

52:01.418 --> 52:03.318
Hey, look.

52:03.386 --> 52:05.877
Well, this towrs
full of surprises.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.618
- Did you have any luck?
- Gimme a smoke.

52:08.692 --> 52:11.593
- There's your brand right there, pal.
- Easy, Pepper.

52:12.996 --> 52:16.193
- You owe me half a twenty, cowboy.
- Yeah, well, earn it.

52:16.266 --> 52:19.963
Your friend's daughter? Stark is
keepin' her in a house over by the river.

52:20.036 --> 52:22.596
Aha. I'm gonna
give you the address.

52:22.672 --> 52:25.607
I got a better idea.
Why don't you show us?

52:47.364 --> 52:49.298
Okay.

52:52.702 --> 52:55.364
Don't waste a lot of money on rent,
I'll say that for him.

52:55.438 --> 52:58.498
- Which one is it?
- On the end there. 4-B.

52:58.575 --> 53:01.942
- Okay, come on. - Oh, no,
no, no. Uh, not me. Mm-mmm.

53:02.242 --> 53:04.142
That's not
part of the deal.

53:04.642 --> 53:07.042
Where's my other half?

53:07.142 --> 53:10.542
We'll give it to you when we
get back, if she's still there.

53:10.642 --> 53:12.542
She's there, all right.

53:22.042 --> 53:23.942
Gentlemen.

53:47.442 --> 53:49.442
Ohh!

53:50.742 --> 53:53.642
I got 'em here for you,
Mr. Stark.

53:53.742 --> 53:55.542
Just like you said.

53:55.642 --> 53:58.742
You did a good job,
Pop Fly.

53:58.742 --> 54:02.742
Can I get my money now,
Mr. Stark?

54:38.842 --> 54:41.042
Teresa.

54:42.742 --> 54:45.942
- Anybody home?
- Looks like she ain't here.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.542
Come on, Pepper! Come on!

55:41.442 --> 55:44.442
Kick this mule!

55:46.742 --> 55:49.342
- Aah! Damn!
- You okay?

55:49.442 --> 55:51.942
I'm all right!
I'm all right!

55:52.042 --> 55:53.942
Oh, no.

56:08.242 --> 56:10.342
You reckon
somebody'll find him?

56:10.442 --> 56:13.642
We ain't got time to worry about
that now, Pepper. Come on.

56:26.042 --> 56:28.742
Okay, we got
a whole new plan.

56:28.842 --> 56:33.142
- What's that?
- Let's get the hell out of here while we still got two nuts each.

56:33.242 --> 56:35.342
Teresa's still
out there, Pepper.

56:35.342 --> 56:37.842
Goddamn it, don't go
hardheaded on me.

56:37.842 --> 56:41.342
There's nothin' we can do.
Those guys damn near killed us.

56:41.442 --> 56:44.442
Let the police handle this.
They get paid to get shot at.

56:44.542 --> 56:47.842
You always fade in the stretch,
don't you, Pepper? Just like Vegas.

56:47.942 --> 56:51.142
Boy, that rodeo again. You got
a memory like a damned elephant.

56:51.142 --> 56:53.342
I remember when a friend
lets me down.

56:53.442 --> 56:57.342
We were one steer away from
the national championship...

56:57.342 --> 57:00.942
- and you don't even show up.
- We won State, didn't we? Got the buckles to prove it.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.142
It ain't about
winnin' buckles, Pepper.

57:03.242 --> 57:07.042
- It's about being able to count on a friend.
- It's just a damn rodeo.

57:07.142 --> 57:11.542
It was more than a rodeo!
It was a down payment on my ranch!

57:11.642 --> 57:15.642
I'd been dreamin' about that since we were
wearin' short pants and ridin' stick horses.

57:15.742 --> 57:18.642
But you don't care about
other people's dreams.

57:18.742 --> 57:21.542
You sure as hell don't care
that Nacho died for his.

57:21.642 --> 57:25.642
I don't see how lettin' some crazy
bastard shoot our fuzzy asses off...

57:25.642 --> 57:28.642
is gonna bring Nacho
back to life.

57:30.142 --> 57:33.042
- Get out.
- What?

57:33.142 --> 57:35.642
Get the hell out!

57:46.642 --> 57:49.242
Sonny!

58:04.142 --> 58:06.142
Taxi!

58:06.242 --> 58:08.142
Asshole!

58:09.842 --> 58:13.442
I didn't mean you, pardner.
Follow that red pickup.

58:19.242 --> 58:21.742
I've come to pick up
my guns, ma'am.

58:26.342 --> 58:29.542
There. Right there.
Pull over.

58:34.342 --> 58:36.742
That's
four-fifty, please.

58:36.842 --> 58:40.942
- Hey, you take a check?
- Take a check? Take a hike!

58:41.042 --> 58:43.042
Four-fifty, please.

58:43.042 --> 58:45.042
All right.

58:46.842 --> 58:49.542
Oh, shit.

58:49.542 --> 58:51.642
Okay.

58:51.742 --> 58:56.042
Here. One, two.

58:56.142 --> 59:00.542
Two-fifty, two fifty-five...

59:03.742 --> 59:07.142
- That'd be all of them.
- $4,000 for the lot.

59:07.142 --> 59:09.442
$4,000? These here
are my guns, lady.

59:09.542 --> 59:12.442
They are yours
for 4,000 bucks.

59:12.442 --> 59:15.642
- Well, look, I just need a couple of 'em.
- Teddy!

59:15.742 --> 59:19.442
- I'll give you an I.O.U. It's the
best I can do right now. - Good-bye!

59:19.442 --> 59:21.542
You hear her?
She said good-bye.

59:21.642 --> 59:23.742
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what?

59:23.742 --> 59:25.742
Don't do this?

59:26.942 --> 59:31.142
I'll tell you one more time:
Don't push me again.

59:34.042 --> 59:36.442
Ohh.

59:41.342 --> 59:44.342
Not my personal best time,
but it'll do.

59:44.342 --> 59:46.342
Hey!

59:48.442 --> 59:50.342
Yahoo.

59:55.342 --> 59:59.342
Lady, look,
how about a trade?

59:59.342 --> 01:00:01.342
You like
this belt buckle?

01:00:01.342 --> 01:00:06.142
Solid silver and gold. Only two of 'em
like this in the whole wide world.

01:00:06.242 --> 01:00:10.442
- What is won'th?
- I don't know. It ain't won'th a damn thing to me no more.

01:00:15.342 --> 01:00:17.742
Oh, Sonny,
don't do that.

01:00:20.642 --> 01:00:23.742
- Only two like it in the whole world?
- That's right.

01:00:28.942 --> 01:00:30.842
Manny.

01:00:30.942 --> 01:00:34.742
How you doin'?
Come on in.

01:00:37.242 --> 01:00:39.942
Is the girl here?

01:00:39.942 --> 01:00:42.942
Yeah, uh, she's upstain's.
Why?

01:00:42.942 --> 01:00:46.242
- Go get her.
- Hey, wait a second. What are you doin'?

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:49.742
John...
where's her father?

01:00:52.242 --> 01:00:55.742
He came around looking for her.
This guy got out of control.

01:00:55.842 --> 01:00:58.842
I'm not kidding you, Manny.
Out of control.

01:00:58.842 --> 01:01:02.142
It was an accident, that's all.
Just an accident.

01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:05.742
He could've screwed us.
I took care of it.

01:01:05.842 --> 01:01:07.742
It was an "accident"?

01:01:08.942 --> 01:01:11.642
He got
out of control, huh?

01:01:13.142 --> 01:01:16.942
Why? What did you do, huh?

01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:20.342
Tried to get more money
out of him, right, John?

01:01:21.742 --> 01:01:24.042
Those cowboys
the other day...

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:26.642
They were looking for him,
werert they?

01:01:28.742 --> 01:01:30.642
Huh?

01:01:30.742 --> 01:01:33.442
It's being
taken care of, Manny.

01:01:33.542 --> 01:01:35.442
I can handle it.

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:39.942
The cowboys got away, John.
They're still out there.

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:41.942
So, what now,
more killing?

01:01:44.142 --> 01:01:46.942
Take her out.

01:01:49.842 --> 01:01:51.742
You gonna kill her too?

01:01:53.842 --> 01:01:58.942
- We are not in the killing business, goddamn it!
- There's another solution, Manny.

01:01:59.042 --> 01:02:01.042
We sell her.

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:04.042
We can make a lot of money off
a young girl like that.

01:02:04.142 --> 01:02:07.642
A hell of a lot more than she's making
for us in any sweatshop.

01:02:07.642 --> 01:02:11.242
You have been doing a lot of figuring,
haven't you, John?

01:02:11.342 --> 01:02:14.842
- This will protect you! It's the smart thing to do!
- Shut up!

01:02:16.342 --> 01:02:20.442
What we do with her is up to me,
because you work for me!

01:02:21.942 --> 01:02:26.342
And when the buying and selling
that goes on behind my back...

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:28.342
gets in the way...

01:02:28.442 --> 01:02:30.442
then it stops.

01:02:35.742 --> 01:02:38.242
Why are you treatin' me
like this, Manny?

01:02:38.242 --> 01:02:40.042
Huh?

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:45.442
Why are you treatin' me
like this, Manny?

01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:53.542
- Where's Teresa?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:53.642 --> 01:03:57.342
- I know you've got her!
- Screw you, cowboy. I ain't talkin'.

01:03:57.442 --> 01:04:00.942
Which one of you bastards
killed her father?

01:04:12.842 --> 01:04:14.742
No.

01:04:14.842 --> 01:04:19.542
We wait for Stark.
I'll get the rope. We'll tie him up.

01:04:28.442 --> 01:04:31.942
Ho! Hey! Ho!

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:33.942
Crazy sons of bitches.

01:04:39.142 --> 01:04:41.142
Yeah.

01:04:42.742 --> 01:04:45.642
Evenin', ladies.

01:04:51.442 --> 01:04:55.042
Excuse me, sin'. This party is
by invitation only.

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:57.042
- Invitation only, huh?
- Yes, sin'.

01:04:57.142 --> 01:05:00.742
- What's that look like, Mac, a chicken fried steak?
- Please excuse me. Enter.

01:05:00.842 --> 01:05:02.742
Uh-huh.

01:05:06.742 --> 01:05:11.842
- Whoo!

01:05:16.842 --> 01:05:20.542
Boy, a fella could get a terminal
erection in here, couldn't he?

01:05:20.642 --> 01:05:22.542
Speak for yourself.

01:05:22.642 --> 01:05:25.442
Excuse me, can I take
your hat, sin'?

01:05:25.442 --> 01:05:28.742
Hell, no, you won't take my hat.
Here, take my bag.

01:05:28.742 --> 01:05:32.742
- Thanks.

01:05:41.942 --> 01:05:43.842
- Howdy, pardner.
- How you doin'?

01:05:43.942 --> 01:05:46.842
- I'll be better if you got some mescal back there.
- Sure do.

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:48.942
- Mescal, 1993.
- I know it well.

01:05:49.042 --> 01:05:51.642
- Thank you so much.

01:05:57.142 --> 01:05:59.442
- Ho!

01:05:59.442 --> 01:06:01.842
- Slow down there, amigo.

01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:08.742
- Ah. Thank you.

01:06:08.842 --> 01:06:10.742
- Much obliged.

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.442
- Have a good night.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:22.542
- Howdy. Remember me?

01:06:22.642 --> 01:06:26.242
- Oh. Sorry. You look just like my sister.

01:06:26.342 --> 01:06:28.642
- But she ain't stuck up!

01:06:28.742 --> 01:06:31.942
- Ho!

01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:34.642
- Whoo! You're a bad boy, you know it?

01:06:34.642 --> 01:06:36.742
- Hell, yeah, I know it.

01:06:36.842 --> 01:06:39.742
I'm glad you came.
I was hoping you would, Mr...

01:06:39.842 --> 01:06:42.842
- Lewis. Pepper Lewis.
- Pepper Lewis.

01:06:42.842 --> 01:06:45.342
Wild horses couldn't
have kept me away.

01:06:45.342 --> 01:06:49.242
- So, this is your party, huh?
- Mmm. For a new client.

01:06:49.342 --> 01:06:52.242
- What business you in?
- I own a modeling agency.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:57.442
- Mmm.
- So these people are all clothing designers, manufacturers, distributors.

01:06:57.542 --> 01:07:00.642
They're all here to see
the new lines, the new models.

01:07:00.742 --> 01:07:03.742
In fact, you see that gentleman
standing right over there?

01:07:03.842 --> 01:07:07.142
That's Alfonse Salini,
the famous Italian designer.

01:07:07.242 --> 01:07:10.342
No shit.
Hey, Al!

01:07:10.442 --> 01:07:12.842
How's your hammer
hangin', boy?

01:07:14.142 --> 01:07:17.042
- Where's your friend?
- Sonny?

01:07:17.142 --> 01:07:20.642
Oh. Well, we ain't as close
as we used to be.

01:07:20.642 --> 01:07:23.142
I decided
to go my own way.

01:07:23.142 --> 01:07:25.742
There's some people
I'd like you to meet.

01:07:28.442 --> 01:07:30.542
Jacques. Gaston.

01:07:30.642 --> 01:07:34.342
Pepper Lewis, meet my
new friends, Jacques and Gaston.

01:07:34.442 --> 01:07:37.342
- Hi.
- Howdy, boys. Pepper Lewis. How you doin'?

01:07:37.442 --> 01:07:39.542
- Margarette, this is our cowboy?
- Oui.

01:07:39.642 --> 01:07:42.642
- I love this cowboy.
- Look at this face.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:45.442
Hey. You about to lose you
a hand there, Pierre.

01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:48.542
Margarette,
did you hear that?

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:51.642
Ah, this cowboy...
Formidable.

01:07:51.642 --> 01:07:53.942
- Didrt I tell you?
- Tell 'em what?

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:59.142
You know, I love him. I love the hat,
the boots, the, how do you say...

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:02.842
- The attitude!
- Attitude! That's it! He is a man for all men!

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:05.042
Hey! Oh...
What the hell?

01:08:05.142 --> 01:08:07.042
You a couple
of rope suckers?

01:08:07.142 --> 01:08:09.142
He is perfect!

01:08:09.242 --> 01:08:11.142
Perfect!

01:08:11.242 --> 01:08:13.442
Yes, I knew
you'd be pleased.

01:08:13.442 --> 01:08:15.442
Pepper!

01:08:17.142 --> 01:08:20.042
Them's some wein'd ducks
you got there, you know it?

01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:22.442
- They want you to model for them.
- Model?

01:08:22.542 --> 01:08:25.841
They design mers undergarments.
Check it out.

01:08:29.242 --> 01:08:33.142
Let a bunch of people I don't even know
see me gallivantin' around in my underwear?

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:36.142
Pays $500 an hour.
I can probably get you more.

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:40.242
I don't care if it pays a million
dollars an hour. I wouldn't do it.

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:42.242
Well...

01:08:42.242 --> 01:08:45.742
if you change your mind,
you've got my number.

01:08:47.142 --> 01:08:50.742
- Well, now, hang on there, missy.

01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.742
Hey! That ain't the way
this party's supposed to end.

01:08:53.841 --> 01:08:55.742
- Ooh.
- Let's dance.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.742
- Yeah? To this?
- If it's got hain' on it, I can ride it.

01:08:58.841 --> 01:09:01.742
If it's got a beat, I can dance
to it. Hold that, Jean-Claude.

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:54.442
Take it off!
Take it off!

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:56.442
Take it off, cowboy!

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:59.342
Whoo!

01:09:59.342 --> 01:10:01.342
- Take it off, baby!
- Yeah!

01:11:45.142 --> 01:11:47.042
Sonny?

01:11:47.142 --> 01:11:49.242
Sonny.

01:11:49.342 --> 01:11:51.842
Teresa.

01:11:51.942 --> 01:11:55.242
You know who I am.

01:11:56.842 --> 01:12:00.042
My father sent me pictures
of you in his letters.

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:04.642
He showed me everything
you ever sent him too.

01:12:04.742 --> 01:12:07.442
Practically
watched you grow up.

01:12:09.042 --> 01:12:11.942
Ohh.

01:12:12.042 --> 01:12:13.942
Teresa...

01:12:15.542 --> 01:12:18.442
I have to tell you
about your father.

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:20.642
He, uh...

01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:22.742
Shh.

01:12:23.742 --> 01:12:25.742
I know.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.742
I'm sorry.

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:38.742
I can't do it.
They're too tight.

01:12:38.842 --> 01:12:41.742
There's a knife
under my jacket in my belt.

01:12:52.842 --> 01:12:55.142
You ever done
a shiver shot?

01:12:56.742 --> 01:12:59.942
Well, this just happens
to be your lucky day.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:01.942
Pretty simple,
really.

01:13:03.142 --> 01:13:05.842
Just take this,
put it right there.

01:13:06.942 --> 01:13:09.642
- Put that... there.
- Hmm?

01:13:09.642 --> 01:13:12.842
- Now you get the shiver.
- Mmm!

01:13:14.942 --> 01:13:16.842
Mmmm!

01:13:16.942 --> 01:13:18.842
Mmm.

01:13:18.942 --> 01:13:20.942
And I... get the shot.

01:13:26.342 --> 01:13:28.142
Ahhh!

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:39.042
I know
you eat the worm.

01:13:42.442 --> 01:13:44.442
Well...

01:13:45.442 --> 01:13:47.842
don't be shy.

01:13:54.842 --> 01:13:56.842
Holy jumping Jesus.

01:13:58.042 --> 01:14:00.642
You know that guy?

01:14:00.742 --> 01:14:04.642
- John Stark?
- Yeah. He a friend of yours?

01:14:04.742 --> 01:14:07.642
Not really.
He's a clothing manufacturer.

01:14:07.742 --> 01:14:09.642
Clothing manufacturer,
my patoot.

01:14:09.742 --> 01:14:11.842
- Come on. Introduce him to me.
- Mmm!

01:14:11.942 --> 01:14:16.942
- It's got a beautiful cut to it.
- Uh, excuse me. Pepper Lewis, John Stark.

01:14:16.942 --> 01:14:19.342
I already know
this son of a bitch.

01:14:19.442 --> 01:14:22.642
- Oh, I didn't know
this was a costume party.

01:14:26.642 --> 01:14:30.542
This son of a bitch killed my friend
Nacho and kidnapped his daughter!

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:33.542
He's a slave trader,
is what he i...

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:37.242
I think this guy's had
a few too many to drink, huh?

01:14:37.242 --> 01:14:40.542
Is that the best you got?
Even the old Cuban had better than that.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:44.642
Now, you get this piece of shit out
of my way! Get him out of here!

01:15:16.142 --> 01:15:18.142
Oh, shit! Sonny!

01:15:22.442 --> 01:15:24.342
Shaw!

01:15:24.442 --> 01:15:27.842
- Hey, buddy, I thought you went home.
- Believe me, I want to.

01:15:27.942 --> 01:15:31.742
- Loan me your horse, will ya?
- I don't loan my horse to anybody.

01:15:31.842 --> 01:15:34.142
Sonny's in trouble.

01:15:34.242 --> 01:15:36.442
Hop on.

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:39.342
Hyah!

01:15:54.442 --> 01:15:56.742
Qué pasa, John?

01:15:56.742 --> 01:16:00.242
- You don't look so good.
- Yeah, I don't feel so good either.

01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:04.542
What's goin' on?

01:16:07.942 --> 01:16:09.942
Don't you know?

01:16:09.942 --> 01:16:13.042
- I thought you had everything under control.
- What are we gonna do, Manny?

01:16:13.042 --> 01:16:15.342
Stand here all night
playing games?

01:16:16.842 --> 01:16:19.742
Malagradecido, carajo.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:23.942
I took you in right out of prison
and gave you everything you got.

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:26.942
And you never had to
remind me of that, did you?

01:16:30.542 --> 01:16:33.142
You got greedy.

01:16:33.242 --> 01:16:37.142
You killed that old man
for a lousy five grand.

01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.842
You need me, Manny...

01:16:45.942 --> 01:16:48.542
because
I get things done.

01:16:48.542 --> 01:16:52.742
The things that you ain't got
the stomach for anymore.

01:16:56.942 --> 01:17:00.342
What I haven't got the stomach
for anymore is you, John.

01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:06.842
So get the hell
out of here.

01:17:06.942 --> 01:17:09.542
You don't work for me
anymore.

01:17:14.242 --> 01:17:16.242
You're right.

01:17:17.742 --> 01:17:19.642
I don't.

01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:31.442
What makes you think...

01:17:31.542 --> 01:17:34.442
that you're
so much better than me?

01:17:45.842 --> 01:17:48.142
You got a problem
with this?

01:17:48.242 --> 01:17:50.742
I ain't
got a problem.

01:17:50.842 --> 01:17:53.942
- You got a problem?
- No. No.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:14.542
How you doin', baby? Hmm?

01:18:14.542 --> 01:18:18.042
I wanna talk to you for a second.
Let him go, Chango.

01:18:18.142 --> 01:18:20.442
Come here.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:24.842
You know, you never should've
left the cow shit. Hmm?

01:18:24.942 --> 01:18:27.042
[Ohh!

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:31.442
Okay, get the girl.
Let's get outta here.

01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:35.042
What do you want me to do
with the vaquero?

01:18:35.142 --> 01:18:37.442
Him? Cut his throat.

01:18:41.042 --> 01:18:42.942
Okay, cowboy...

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:45.342
it's show time.

01:19:01.242 --> 01:19:03.142
No!

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:24.142
What are you
planning to do?

01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:26.142
I let my friend down twice.
I ain't gonna do it again.

01:19:26.242 --> 01:19:29.142
You're gonna get yourself killed!
We gotta call for backup.

01:19:29.142 --> 01:19:31.742
- I thought you wanted to be a cowboy.
- Yeah, I do, but...

01:19:31.842 --> 01:19:34.942
Well, mister,
this is the cowboy way.

01:19:35.042 --> 01:19:37.042
Wha-hoo!

01:19:58.542 --> 01:20:00.442
Hold on! Don't move!

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.442
Where's my buddy?

01:20:03.842 --> 01:20:05.742
Aah!

01:20:05.842 --> 01:20:08.842
Whoa. Get over there
where I can keep an eye on you.

01:20:08.942 --> 01:20:11.642
You heard the man, shit for brains.
Where's his buddy?

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.142
Watch 'em.
I'm gonna go after Sonny.

01:20:15.142 --> 01:20:18.342
You people stand back.
My partner's coming through.

01:20:18.442 --> 01:20:20.342
All right, now, listen up.

01:20:20.442 --> 01:20:23.342
I don't want any talkin',
any lookin' around.

01:20:23.442 --> 01:20:27.942
You're answering to the
big man now... Mad Dog Shaw.

01:20:43.042 --> 01:20:45.742
Say adiós, Cowboy.

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.342
A- day-os.

01:20:51.642 --> 01:20:54.842
- About time, Pepper.
- Better late than never.

01:20:54.942 --> 01:20:57.742
- They took Teresa.
- Took her where?

01:20:57.842 --> 01:21:00.142
This son of a bitch
here knows.

01:21:02.142 --> 01:21:05.142
Move!

01:21:06.242 --> 01:21:08.342
- Good work, Sam.
- Sure thing.

01:21:08.342 --> 01:21:12.642
- Nice to see you, Sam.
- Come on, man, where you guys takin' me, man?

01:21:18.042 --> 01:21:21.142
Thanks for your cooperation.
Drinks are on the house.

01:21:30.042 --> 01:21:33.042
Hee-yah!

01:21:34.442 --> 01:21:37.842
- You'd better tell us where she is.
- Screw you, buddy.

01:21:37.842 --> 01:21:40.842
This son of a bitch
ain't talkin', Sonny.

01:21:40.842 --> 01:21:45.342
Yeah, well, maybe we oughta show him
how Pancho Villa used to make guys talk.

01:21:54.642 --> 01:21:58.142
- You might think this here's gonna be fun...
- I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

01:21:58.242 --> 01:22:01.642
- Hell, for the fin'st three or
four seconds it just might be.

01:22:01.742 --> 01:22:03.742
Ooh-eee, fellas,
lookit there!

01:22:03.842 --> 01:22:05.842
You fellas
found a big one.

01:22:05.842 --> 01:22:09.042
I had hell pullin' him off
his mama's tit.

01:22:09.142 --> 01:22:12.142
- Hungry bugger, isn't he?
- Yep. Starvin'.

01:22:12.242 --> 01:22:14.142
You hear that,
asshole?

01:22:14.242 --> 01:22:18.642
Screw you, I ain't talkin'.
What's a baby cow gonna do to me?

01:22:20.442 --> 01:22:22.942
- Hey, uh... Oh, come on,
man, what you doin'?

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.442
I am embarrassed.

01:22:25.542 --> 01:22:28.842
Our friend here is not
wearin' any underpants.

01:22:28.942 --> 01:22:31.642
Oh! He sees it.

01:22:31.742 --> 01:22:35.342
Damn! That hungry devil thinks
your little weenie is his mama's tit!

01:22:35.442 --> 01:22:38.342
Hey, wait a minute, man.
You guys can't do this.

01:22:38.442 --> 01:22:41.742
I'll ask you one more time,
asshole: Where's Teresa?

01:22:41.842 --> 01:22:43.742
I ain't tellin' you shit.

01:22:44.942 --> 01:22:47.642
It's your call, Stubby.
Let him go, Pepper.

01:22:49.742 --> 01:22:52.742
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:22:57.142 --> 01:23:00.242
Damn, that looks like
it hurts.

01:23:10.342 --> 01:23:13.542
Round up a posse, boys!

01:23:19.142 --> 01:23:21.042
Come on.

01:23:21.142 --> 01:23:23.742
Let's take her down
to the dock.

01:23:26.042 --> 01:23:28.842
- Pepper.
- Yep.

01:23:28.942 --> 01:23:33.142
You know, about that rodeo...
I want you to forget about it, okay?

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:36.142
You just got drunk, that's all.
It could've happened to anybody.

01:23:36.242 --> 01:23:39.142
- You ain't mad at me no more?
- No, I ain't mad at you.

01:23:39.242 --> 01:23:41.742
You were right.
It's just a damn rodeo.

01:23:43.242 --> 01:23:46.542
Last night, I was gonna take
all those guys on by myself.

01:23:46.642 --> 01:23:48.542
I just couldn't do it
without you.

01:23:50.242 --> 01:23:52.042
The whole time I was
sitting there, thinkin'...

01:23:52.042 --> 01:23:56.642
"Goddamn it, Pepper oughta be here with me.
" Started getting mad at you all over again.

01:23:56.742 --> 01:24:01.142
Then I realized I wasrt mad at you,
I was mad at myself.

01:24:01.242 --> 01:24:05.342
'Cause you were right... there's just
some things I can't do on my own.

01:24:05.342 --> 01:24:07.642
And I hated you
for that.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.642
You understand
what I'm sayin'?

01:24:11.742 --> 01:24:16.642
Yeah, I think you're tryin' to say, deep
down you're a chicken shit. Is that it?

01:24:17.742 --> 01:24:20.542
No, Pepper,
that ain't it.

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:23.642
Here's that warehouse,
just like old Stubby said.

01:24:23.742 --> 01:24:26.942
Pepper, just forget it, okay?
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

01:24:27.042 --> 01:24:30.442
All I'm trying to say is I ain't
mad at you 'cause you got drunk...

01:24:30.542 --> 01:24:34.642
and completely ruined
my chances of getting that ranch.

01:24:51.642 --> 01:24:53.542
- Sonny.
- What?

01:24:54.942 --> 01:24:57.342
Listen, uh,
actually, I, uh...

01:24:58.442 --> 01:25:00.642
- I wasrt drunk.
- Huh?

01:25:02.442 --> 01:25:06.042
At the rodeo, I wasrt...
I wasrt drunk, I was just...

01:25:07.142 --> 01:25:09.342
bein' selfish again,
like always.

01:25:09.442 --> 01:25:12.042
What are you talkin'
about, Pepper?

01:25:12.142 --> 01:25:16.542
I knew we was gonna win that night...
ain't nobody could've beat us.

01:25:16.642 --> 01:25:19.542
I guess that's why
I didn't show up.

01:25:21.042 --> 01:25:24.042
Didrt want you
to buy that ranch.

01:25:25.242 --> 01:25:27.742
Guess I just always
figured we were...

01:25:27.842 --> 01:25:30.542
better together
than we were on our own.

01:25:30.642 --> 01:25:33.642
Didrt want to
split up the team.

01:25:36.242 --> 01:25:38.142
Get what
I'm trying to say?

01:25:39.742 --> 01:25:41.642
Yeah, I think so.

01:25:41.742 --> 01:25:47.042
I think you're trying to say
that deep down you're a chicken shit.

01:25:49.542 --> 01:25:51.742
I knew you'd understand,
old buddy.

01:25:52.942 --> 01:25:54.742
You ready?

01:25:57.942 --> 01:26:02.242
- You gotta show me how to do that someday.
- It'd be my pleasure.

01:26:04.242 --> 01:26:06.942
- Lock it?
- Yeah.

01:26:17.142 --> 01:26:19.042
What are you doin'?

01:26:19.142 --> 01:26:21.942
- Nothin'.
- Put it away.

01:27:54.642 --> 01:27:56.542
You cover me.

01:28:22.842 --> 01:28:25.142
Jesus!

01:28:28.142 --> 01:28:30.342
- Shut up!
- No!

01:28:30.442 --> 01:28:33.542
Oh, no! No!

01:28:35.642 --> 01:28:38.942
Okay, everybody,
hold it right there!

01:28:39.042 --> 01:28:41.842
Let the girl go!

01:29:04.342 --> 01:29:06.742
Come on. Come on!

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:33.642
Shit.

01:29:33.742 --> 01:29:35.642
Goddamn it!

01:29:47.742 --> 01:29:49.642
Well, if it ain't
Bill Pickett.

01:29:53.042 --> 01:29:56.242
Let's go! Come on, move!

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:14.942
Nice work, Sam.

01:30:16.342 --> 01:30:18.842
Hey, thanks a lot, guys.
We're bringing the boat in now.

01:30:18.942 --> 01:30:21.442
- How's Teresa?
- Boat's secure, sin'.

01:30:21.742 --> 01:30:25.142
Son of a bitch!

01:30:35.342 --> 01:30:37.342
Go! Go!

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.742
- We'll never catch that bastard.
- The hell we won't.

01:30:59.242 --> 01:31:01.342
Shit!

01:31:07.142 --> 01:31:09.342
Pepper, duck!

01:31:16.642 --> 01:31:20.142
Son of a bitch!

01:31:24.442 --> 01:31:28.042
Yee-hoo-hoo!
Yee-hah!

01:31:36.942 --> 01:31:38.742
He turned right!

01:31:48.142 --> 01:31:50.042
There!

01:31:52.042 --> 01:31:56.242
Hey, hey, wait a minute!
You can't just leave it...

01:32:23.842 --> 01:32:26.042
- Aah!
- Shit!

01:32:27.342 --> 01:32:29.742
Hey!

01:32:34.142 --> 01:32:36.242
They're not in the car!

01:32:36.342 --> 01:32:38.642
They gotta be
in the subway!

01:32:41.642 --> 01:32:43.742
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

01:32:43.842 --> 01:32:46.742
Thank you!
Excuse me! Thank you!

01:32:49.942 --> 01:32:52.442
Police!
Police! Police!

01:33:05.842 --> 01:33:07.742
There he is!

01:33:07.842 --> 01:33:09.742
- Where's the train going?
- Brooklyn.

01:33:09.842 --> 01:33:13.242
- Any way we can head it off?
- Head it off? It's a fucking train!

01:33:16.342 --> 01:33:18.742
It'll come
out on the Manattan Bridge...

01:33:18.842 --> 01:33:21.042
but we'll never make it
through this traffic.

01:33:31.942 --> 01:33:33.842
Hyah!

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:38.242
Yee-hah!

01:33:39.942 --> 01:33:41.842
- Hey!
- Follow the river!

01:33:41.942 --> 01:33:44.842
- I need to use your radio.
- They stole our horses!

01:33:44.942 --> 01:33:46.942
Don't worry,
they're good with horses.

01:33:47.042 --> 01:33:50.542
10-13, 53rd and Lex.
We have a hostage situation.

01:33:50.542 --> 01:33:55.742
10-4. All units, all units.
10-13, 53rd and Lex.

01:33:55.842 --> 01:33:58.742
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Ho!

01:33:58.842 --> 01:34:01.742
Police business!
I need your cab! Come on, out!

01:34:01.842 --> 01:34:03.742
Thank you very much!

01:34:06.342 --> 01:34:08.342
Hey, get a job,
will ya?

01:34:15.842 --> 01:34:19.142
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Ahh-hah! Hyah!

01:34:26.642 --> 01:34:28.842
Go ahead. Sit down.

01:34:40.142 --> 01:34:42.142
Move it!

01:34:42.242 --> 01:34:45.942
Come on! Let's go!

01:35:04.842 --> 01:35:06.842
Hyah!

01:35:07.842 --> 01:35:09.842
Hyah! Hyah!

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.242
Whoo!

01:35:20.742 --> 01:35:22.742
Hyah!

01:35:22.742 --> 01:35:24.742
Ho! Ho! Whoa!

01:35:25.842 --> 01:35:28.142
- Come on! Come on!
- Hyah! Gidd'up!

01:35:28.142 --> 01:35:31.342
- Whoa! Yee-Hoo!
- Hyah!

01:35:36.342 --> 01:35:39.242
I need to know the fin'st train stop
after the Manattan Bridge.

01:35:39.342 --> 01:35:41.242
I need backup there now!

01:35:41.342 --> 01:35:43.742
That would be
the 62nd Street station.

01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:06.042
Hyah!

01:36:06.042 --> 01:36:09.642
- Hyah! Hyah, hyah!
- Hyah!

01:36:09.742 --> 01:36:11.642
Hyah!

01:36:22.142 --> 01:36:24.342
Look, Mom!
Cowboys!

01:36:28.842 --> 01:36:31.042
There he is!

01:36:42.742 --> 01:36:45.642
- Hyah!
- Gidd'up, boy! Whoo!

01:36:47.342 --> 01:36:49.242
Hyah!

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:58.542
- Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

01:37:11.642 --> 01:37:13.542
Hyah!

01:37:23.742 --> 01:37:25.242
Hyah!

01:37:33.842 --> 01:37:35.442
Pepper!

01:37:36.942 --> 01:37:38.742
Come on!

01:37:38.842 --> 01:37:41.642
- Jump!
- Okay!

01:37:41.742 --> 01:37:44.742
Jump!

01:37:46.342 --> 01:37:48.642
Aah!

01:38:13.442 --> 01:38:15.442
Stop the train!

01:38:15.442 --> 01:38:18.842
- I can't! This is the express!
- You stop this train now!

01:38:37.742 --> 01:38:39.942
Coming through!

01:38:51.242 --> 01:38:53.242
Excuse me, please!

01:39:00.042 --> 01:39:02.342
Stark!

01:39:02.442 --> 01:39:05.342
- We just want the girl!
- Yeah, and all I want is your guns!

01:39:05.442 --> 01:39:08.542
Throw 'em down on the track.
Do it!

01:39:08.542 --> 01:39:10.442
Do it!

01:39:19.942 --> 01:39:23.342
Don't play games with me.
Give me the other one.

01:39:31.842 --> 01:39:34.742
You cowboys.

01:39:34.742 --> 01:39:37.342
You're a dyin' breed, man.

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.642
Aah!

01:39:43.742 --> 01:39:45.842
Hold it right there!

01:39:54.142 --> 01:39:57.042
Pepper, heel it!

01:40:03.642 --> 01:40:05.742
Give it up, man.
There's nowhere to go.

01:40:35.542 --> 01:40:38.142
- Shaw, are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:40:38.242 --> 01:40:41.442
- Give him a hand.
- Take it slow, take it slow.

01:40:41.542 --> 01:40:43.842
Thank you.

01:40:43.942 --> 01:40:45.842
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:40:45.942 --> 01:40:47.842
- Nice throw.
- Not bad yourself.

01:40:47.942 --> 01:40:49.942
Thank you.

01:40:50.242 --> 01:40:52.242
Can't thank you enough, Sam.

01:40:52.342 --> 01:40:53.842
Hey, my pleasure,
Sonny.

01:40:53.842 --> 01:40:57.742
- Don't you forget you got an open invitation to come see us.
- Thanks.

01:40:57.842 --> 01:41:00.942
- Pepper.
- Saw you in the paper this morning, Sam.

01:41:01.042 --> 01:41:03.242
- Yeah?
- Good picture.

01:41:03.342 --> 01:41:07.042
Put me in mind of William Pickett.

01:41:07.142 --> 01:41:09.842
- How's that shoulder?
- Oh, it's, um...

01:41:09.942 --> 01:41:12.042
Oh, it's, it's okay.

01:41:12.142 --> 01:41:14.442
Well, this'll cure
what ails you.

01:41:14.542 --> 01:41:17.342
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:41:17.342 --> 01:41:19.442
How's your butt?

01:41:19.442 --> 01:41:21.742
Tender subject, Sam.

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:25.542
Okay, off we go. Ho!

01:41:27.242 --> 01:41:29.742
Teresa, you take care
of these two.

01:41:29.842 --> 01:41:32.642
I will.

01:41:32.742 --> 01:41:34.642
So long, Sam.

01:41:38.242 --> 01:41:41.942
Got a little somethin' here for you,
Sonny. Thought you might want it back.

01:41:45.442 --> 01:41:47.242
Damn, Pepper.

01:41:48.342 --> 01:41:50.942
How the hell'd you get the money
to pay for this buckle?

01:41:50.942 --> 01:41:53.942
There ain't no hill
for a high stepper.

01:41:54.042 --> 01:41:57.142
- You didn't give that old lady a bad check, did you?
- Hell, no!

01:41:57.242 --> 01:41:59.242
Old bitch
wouldn't take a check.

01:41:59.242 --> 01:42:02.042
- So how'd you come up with the money?
- I ain't tellin'.

01:42:02.142 --> 01:42:04.642
- Pepper!
- Nope. My secret.

01:42:04.742 --> 01:42:08.042
You ain't gonna know,
not in a million years.

01:42:08.142 --> 01:42:11.042
- Pepper.
- Don't ask me. I'll go to my grave with it.
