[indistinct conversations]

00:02.580 --> 00:03.959
- Dana: Reid, let's go.
- Hmm?

00:04.009 --> 00:05.312
I need you on an urgent consult.

00:05.362 --> 00:06.710
Come on. Let's move.

00:08.221 --> 00:09.006
You okay?

00:09.056 --> 00:10.430
Just a lot on my plate.

00:10.574 --> 00:12.882
You mean the whole "writing your surgical
boards"/"about to give birth" combo?

00:12.884 --> 00:14.150
[chuckles] Yeah,

00:14.152 --> 00:15.785
and about a million other things
that I've got to do.

00:15.987 --> 00:18.905
I'm trying to change my will.
I have to call my mother.

00:18.955 --> 00:19.688
So call her.

00:19.738 --> 00:21.455
[inhales sharply] It's not that easy.

00:21.505 --> 00:22.959
I haven't talked to her in over a year.

00:22.961 --> 00:24.561
- She doesn't even know I'm pregnant.
- What?

00:24.563 --> 00:27.180
- I know. Crazy, right?
- Alex, you're weeks away f...

00:27.230 --> 00:28.630
- I know. I know.
- No, no, no.

00:28.632 --> 00:29.832
This way.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.500
Okay, so, who's the patient?

00:31.502 --> 00:33.769
- The what?
- The urgent consult you're taking me on.

00:33.771 --> 00:37.238
Oh, he's a man who is
experiencing many complications.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.508
All: Surprise!

00:39.510 --> 00:41.142
You guys!

00:41.144 --> 00:42.310
Wow.

00:42.312 --> 00:43.376
Maggie: I know you said don't do anything,

00:43.426 --> 00:46.014
but we are talking about the
most type-A woman on the planet.

00:46.016 --> 00:47.815
Speaking of type-A women, where's Dawn?

00:47.817 --> 00:49.017
Tell me we invited her.

00:49.019 --> 00:51.086
Dr. Bell's in a board meeting.
She sends her regrets.

00:51.088 --> 00:52.553
Sparkling grape juice.

00:52.555 --> 00:53.888
Thank you.

00:53.890 --> 00:57.125
Wow. These are the most
beautiful flower cupcakes.

00:57.127 --> 00:59.259
- Actually, they're vaginas.
- I'm sorry?

00:59.261 --> 01:01.095
Yep. I was up all night

01:01.097 --> 01:02.797
with my anatomy textbook and my baker's hat.

01:02.799 --> 01:04.998
And we all pitched in, got you some wheels.

01:05.001 --> 01:06.367
Oh, my god, you guys.

01:06.369 --> 01:08.870
I don't know whether to hit you or cry.

01:08.872 --> 01:10.371
Um [chuckles] it's okay.

01:10.373 --> 01:12.740
Um, pass me one of those cupcakes.

01:12.742 --> 01:15.976
So, 36 weeks. You all ready for baby?

01:15.978 --> 01:17.224
No, uh, not even close.
[cellphone vibrates]

01:17.300 --> 01:19.880
I have a mountain of paperwork,
and I can't even close my eyes at night

01:19.882 --> 01:23.117
without seeing all the forms
that I haven't filled out yet.

01:23.119 --> 01:25.552
Oh, no. Multi-vehicle accident,
five minutes out.

01:25.554 --> 01:26.853
- All right.
- Eat mine.

01:26.855 --> 01:28.522
- [laughs]
- Sorry.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.492
[siren wailing]

01:31.494 --> 01:32.826
[indistinct conversations]

01:32.828 --> 01:34.293
Hey, man.

01:34.295 --> 01:36.530
Hey. Aren't you just coming off a call?

01:36.532 --> 01:38.398
Back end of a 14-hour surgery, man.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.633
Then what are you still doing here?

01:39.635 --> 01:40.967
What does it look like I'm doing here?

01:40.969 --> 01:42.335
[muttering]

01:42.337 --> 01:44.504
Is that a ring box in your pocket?

01:44.506 --> 01:45.906
I'm just happy to see you, Zach.

01:45.908 --> 01:49.008
Right. I can't believe I got to
cancel on my kids again.

01:49.010 --> 01:50.609
Yeah. Duty calls, I guess, right?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.245
Yeah, well, I wish duty would call the ex.

01:52.247 --> 01:54.347
- She still giving you a hard time?
- I don't blame her.

01:54.349 --> 01:56.182
I'm not really
the most reliable copilot.

01:56.184 --> 01:57.683
Yeah, but she knows what the job is, right?

01:57.685 --> 01:59.252
How did you ever convince
that woman to marry you?

01:59.254 --> 02:01.187
[chuckles] It's actually
a really bad story.

02:01.189 --> 02:02.588
So, I forgot her birthday one year,

02:02.590 --> 02:04.323
like just literally forgot completely.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.391
I had to get her something, so I proposed.

02:06.393 --> 02:07.893
And they say romance is dead.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.262
You know that I'm divorced,
right? What do we got?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.698
Passenger van, minor hockey team.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.199
20-year-old male, Hayden Watts,

02:14.201 --> 02:15.834
multiple lacerations,
suspected spinal-cord injury.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.603
Hayden: - Where's... where's Sean?
Joel: - Hey, hey, whoa.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.137
Okay, hey, you have to stay still.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.239
Do not try to sit up, or you're gonna do
yourself serious injury.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.907
You understand me, Hayden?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.242
Good. All right.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.611
So, do transfer on "three." Ready.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.147
One, two, three.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.449
All right, Hayden, I'm just gonna ask you

02:30.451 --> 02:31.783
a few simple questions, all right?

02:31.785 --> 02:33.785
Can you wiggle your toes?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.954
I'm trying.

02:35.956 --> 02:36.955
You feel this?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.623
No.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.558
What about this?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.860
[voice breaking]
No. I can't feel anything.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.361
Okay, buddy, I'm gonna log-roll you,

02:44.363 --> 02:45.529
and we're gonna test your
motor function, all right?

02:45.531 --> 02:48.700
On "three," guys. One, two, and three.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.835
- [breathing heavily]
- All right.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.570
Now we hope like hell

02:52.572 --> 02:55.072
that this feels just a little
uncomfortable, okay, Hayden?

02:55.074 --> 02:56.140
[gasps] Yeah. Yeah.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.541
Okay. Actually, that's a good sign.

02:57.543 --> 02:59.210
That's actually good, man. Hang tight.

02:59.212 --> 03:00.578
He's got an incomplete injury.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.045
Yeah. Let's get him up for a C.T.

03:02.047 --> 03:04.381
of his cervical thoracic lumbar
spine and get him to the O.R.

03:04.383 --> 03:05.716
And keep his pressures up.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.485
If this kid has any chance of walking again,

03:07.487 --> 03:08.685
we got to move fast.

03:08.687 --> 03:10.421
You got that right.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.656
So, this is an actual consult.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.891
I could barely keep a straight face.

03:21.893 --> 03:23.927
This is a patient of Dr. Scott's?

03:23.929 --> 03:25.729
Yeah, and she's a real piece of work...

03:25.731 --> 03:27.964
bullied him into having
a plastic surgeon in there

03:27.966 --> 03:29.032
making all of her cuts.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.399
- For a thyroid surgery?
- Yeah.

03:30.401 --> 03:31.467
She must be persuasive.

03:31.469 --> 03:32.769
Well, that's one word for it.

03:32.771 --> 03:35.304
Dana, why wasn't I called for the trauma?

03:35.923 --> 03:37.644
Um, I don't know.

03:37.694 --> 03:39.584
I guess they didn't need you or...

03:39.634 --> 03:41.752
Right. All hands on deck,
just no swollen ankles.

03:41.802 --> 03:43.215
People are protecting me,
and I don't like it.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.680
I'm not gonna protect you, Alex.

03:44.682 --> 03:45.814
Watch.

03:45.816 --> 03:47.150
You're wrenching my neck.

03:47.152 --> 03:48.518
Sorry, Ma.

03:49.131 --> 03:51.187
Mrs. Badali, this is Dr. Reid.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.456
She's gonna be stepping in
to do your surgery today.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.124
Why? Where's Dr. Scott?

03:55.126 --> 03:56.825
Dr. Scott is home with the flu.

03:56.827 --> 03:58.794
What?! But he's my doctor!

03:58.796 --> 04:01.830
Not to worry. Dr. Reid has done
this operation many times before.

04:01.832 --> 04:04.066
Just my luck. She any good?

04:04.068 --> 04:05.167
You any good?

04:05.169 --> 04:07.602
I'm not sure how to answer that.

04:07.987 --> 04:10.457
Well, you got yourself knocked up.
That doesn't bode well.

04:10.507 --> 04:13.215
Christina: - Ma.
- Christina, go and get my purse for me.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.210
Dana: We're gonna make
a few marks on your neck.

04:15.212 --> 04:16.442
Get me my hand cream.

04:16.445 --> 04:18.980
My other daughter...
the one who's not here...

04:18.982 --> 04:20.314
she's got a kid, too.

04:20.315 --> 04:23.217
I told her to find a flight
of stairs to fall down.

04:23.885 --> 04:25.386
Try not to move, please.

04:25.388 --> 04:27.221
[monitors beeping]

04:27.223 --> 04:30.792
Okay, so, after Dr. Kinney
makes the incision,

04:30.794 --> 04:33.126
I will go in and remove
the thyroid tumor, all right?

04:33.128 --> 04:35.062
She didn't listen, either.

04:35.064 --> 04:38.031
They never do, just like their father.

04:38.033 --> 04:40.334
Leaves me high and dry with two little ones

04:40.336 --> 04:41.669
and a dry-cleaning store.

04:41.671 --> 04:43.737
That is not the right cream.

04:43.739 --> 04:45.005
Give me my bag.

04:45.007 --> 04:47.441
I have to do everything, you know?

04:47.443 --> 04:50.577
I raised them myself.
This is the thanks I get.

04:50.579 --> 04:52.679
Okay, well,
if you don't have any questions,

04:52.681 --> 04:54.014
we'll see you down there.

04:55.983 --> 04:57.718
Still think I'm protecting you?

04:57.720 --> 04:59.326
I thought <i>my</i> mom was crazy.

04:59.393 --> 05:02.622
Sandy, give Mrs. Badali
30 milligrams of diazepam

05:02.624 --> 05:03.697
before you bring her to the O.R.

05:03.747 --> 05:05.321
30? You got it.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.761
Dana, that's enough
to knock out a Shetland pony.

05:08.763 --> 05:09.875
Giddyup.

05:09.925 --> 05:10.857
[chuckles]

05:11.233 --> 05:13.099
Listen, about that, uh,
engagement conversation

05:13.101 --> 05:14.600
we were having earlier...

05:14.602 --> 05:16.302
I hope you're not thinking of
doing something crazy yourself.

05:16.304 --> 05:17.803
I was just making conversation.

05:17.805 --> 05:19.805
Okay. Well, listen,
if you need somebody to talk to,

05:19.807 --> 05:20.806
you know you can always...

05:20.808 --> 05:21.908
Talk to Jackson?

05:21.910 --> 05:23.342
Always talk to Jackson.

05:23.344 --> 05:25.011
[knock on window] Dr. Goran?

05:25.013 --> 05:26.579
Yeah?

05:26.581 --> 05:28.113
[indistinct conversations]

05:28.115 --> 05:29.715
[telephone rings]

05:29.717 --> 05:30.716
[monitors beeping]

05:30.718 --> 05:31.984
Hi, there.

05:31.986 --> 05:33.553
Hey. Uh, I'm looking for Hayden Watts.

05:33.555 --> 05:35.220
Yeah. I'm Dr. Goran. I just treated Hayden.

05:35.222 --> 05:36.556
How is he? Is he okay?

05:36.558 --> 05:37.590
I'm sorry. Who are you?

05:37.592 --> 05:39.324
Um, I-I'm his girlfriend.

05:39.326 --> 05:40.426
Uh, is he okay?

05:40.428 --> 05:41.826
Okay, listen to me.

05:41.828 --> 05:44.829
It's very early, but he has
sustained an injury to his back.

05:44.831 --> 05:47.499
Oh, my god. Is... is he paralyzed?

05:47.501 --> 05:49.468
Look, we're not gonna know anything
till we get him into the O.R.,

05:49.470 --> 05:51.303
but [sighs] we need to stabilize him.

05:51.305 --> 05:52.804
God, I think I might be sick.

05:52.806 --> 05:54.440
Okay, listen to me really
carefully, all right?

05:54.442 --> 05:55.740
Now, where are his parents?

05:55.742 --> 05:57.542
Um [sniffles] it... it's just his mom.

05:57.544 --> 06:00.674
She's, uh... she-she moved
to Blind River last year.

06:00.724 --> 06:01.947
She's... she's already on the road.

06:01.949 --> 06:04.282
Okay. So, this is, uh, my phone number here.

06:04.284 --> 06:05.684
You give it to her.

06:05.686 --> 06:07.218
Um, tell her Hayden had to go into surgery,

06:07.220 --> 06:10.188
there was no time to wait, and
she can call me anytime, okay?

06:10.190 --> 06:11.242
- Yeah, of course.
- And I'll keep you abreast

06:11.292 --> 06:12.189
of any further developments.

06:12.192 --> 06:13.458
Um, what's your name again, please?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.725
- Uh, i-it's Chiti.
- Chiti.

06:14.727 --> 06:16.727
But he, um... he calls me "Cheech."

06:16.729 --> 06:18.429
Okay. Cheech. Thank you.

06:18.431 --> 06:20.798
Uh, hey, uh, a big guy... Sean Danes...

06:20.800 --> 06:22.733
h-has he also been brought in?

06:22.735 --> 06:24.368
Uh, not to my knowledge, no.

06:24.370 --> 06:28.438
Oh. Um, h-he's... he's basically
like Hayden's surrogate brother.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.907
He's his best friend.

06:29.909 --> 06:31.108
Okay. I'll keep an eye out.

06:31.110 --> 06:32.542
- I-I'm sorry. I have to go.
- Okay.

06:33.745 --> 06:35.980
I'm not saying that I was always perfect.

06:35.982 --> 06:38.582
I'm just saying that I did
the best that I could,

06:38.584 --> 06:42.252
and I begged her not to make
the same mistakes that I did.

06:42.254 --> 06:44.287
"Stay in school!"

06:44.289 --> 06:47.090
"Having children
will just destroy your life."

06:47.092 --> 06:49.192
Dana: You just try and relax
and enjoy the ride.

06:49.194 --> 06:51.128
[sighs] And what did she go and do?

06:51.130 --> 06:54.397
Oh, the other one...
Christina... she's hopeless!

06:54.399 --> 06:55.965
She couldn't find a husband

06:55.967 --> 06:58.435
if he was about to be [laughing] deported.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.237
Okay. Mrs. Badali, I just think that,

07:00.239 --> 07:01.904
you know, it's time for you to try to re...

07:01.906 --> 07:03.039
No. Listen to me.

07:03.041 --> 07:05.074
I gave them my life on a silver platter,

07:05.076 --> 07:07.376
and they did nothing but disappoint.

07:07.378 --> 07:09.646
I'm gonna change my will! [laughs]

07:09.648 --> 07:12.988
Dawn: Okay, I've got a green light
on doctors Lopez and Harris.

07:13.151 --> 07:14.983
Whoa, whoa. Where do...
where do you think you're going?

07:14.985 --> 07:16.485
Uh, we have a thyroidectomy in three.

07:16.487 --> 07:18.353
No. I needed three. You can
have it when they're done.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.822
Take your patient back to her room, please.

07:19.872 --> 07:20.554
Theresa: - Wait.
- Okay.

07:20.625 --> 07:21.876
What did she just say?

07:21.926 --> 07:24.912
- Your surgery has been postponed.
- Oh, no, no, no. Nope.

07:24.962 --> 07:26.616
This has been scheduled for months.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.155
Yes, but your surgery is elective.

07:28.222 --> 07:30.866
Excuse me. I did not elect to have cancer.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.468
Alex: And we understand that,
but there's been an accident,

07:32.470 --> 07:34.069
and a man is fighting for his life.

07:34.071 --> 07:35.537
I don't care. When do we go in?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.305
As soon as the operating room
becomes available.

07:37.307 --> 07:38.377
Well, then I hope he dies

07:38.427 --> 07:39.561
- so we get in there faster!
- Okay.

07:39.632 --> 07:40.975
All right, get her out of here.

07:40.978 --> 07:42.477
- All right. All right.
- Stop!

07:42.479 --> 07:45.446
- Now!
- I command you to stop!

07:45.448 --> 07:46.915
- [grunting]
- [scoffs]

07:46.917 --> 07:48.449
"I command you"?

07:48.451 --> 07:50.318
Yeah. I need more coffee.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.519
[sighs]

07:51.521 --> 07:53.721
Unbelievable.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.989
[sighs]

07:54.991 --> 07:56.224
You okay?

07:56.226 --> 07:57.725
Yeah. Just Braxton-Hicks.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.395
I loved her christmas album.
Was that Toni Braxton?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.797
- [laughs]
- Got to scrub.

08:02.799 --> 08:03.864
Good luck.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.032
[water running]

08:05.034 --> 08:06.701
[water shuts off]

08:06.703 --> 08:10.137
[indistinct conversations]

08:10.139 --> 08:12.406
[water running, shuts off]

08:12.408 --> 08:14.274
That's me in there.

08:15.911 --> 08:19.446
So, how am I also out here?

08:19.448 --> 08:21.015
[indistinct conversations]

08:29.824 --> 08:32.158
I thought the quote covered everything,

08:32.159 --> 08:35.294
and now you're saying it's
another $8 a head for babka?

08:35.297 --> 08:36.962
Oh. <i>They</i> asked for it.

08:36.965 --> 08:39.765
O-okay. Add it. Yeah. Thank you. Bye.

08:39.768 --> 08:40.866
Trouble in paradise?

08:40.869 --> 08:42.969
You know,
as soon as you get engaged,

08:42.971 --> 08:45.004
it officially stops being about you.

08:45.006 --> 08:46.840
- Well, you only have...
- A week left.

08:46.842 --> 08:48.041
Yeah. One week.

08:48.043 --> 08:49.675
[cellphone vibrates]

08:49.677 --> 08:50.910
Sorry. Crazy day.

08:50.912 --> 08:53.279
Don't apologize. You're a doctor.

08:53.281 --> 08:56.382
And for the next 12 hours,
so am I. Baruch hashem.

08:56.384 --> 08:58.484
- Thank you. [chuckles]
- I didn't do anything.

08:58.486 --> 09:03.356
You never plan to
and yet always somehow... do.

09:03.358 --> 09:04.357
Hmm.

09:04.359 --> 09:06.191
[cellphone beeps]

09:06.193 --> 09:07.960
Hi, Esther.

09:07.962 --> 09:09.495
Hello.

09:09.497 --> 09:11.063
Oh, you, uh... you're a woman.

09:11.065 --> 09:12.632
Um, look, I can't be alone with you right...

09:12.634 --> 09:14.066
uh, I can't be alone with you.

09:14.068 --> 09:16.534
Okay, Mr. Hoffman.

09:16.536 --> 09:18.904
Herschel Hoffman.

09:18.906 --> 09:21.874
You're... you're Herschel.
You're Dr. Katz's fiancé.

09:21.876 --> 09:23.575
You know Sydney?

09:23.577 --> 09:26.278
Yes. We were just talking about you.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.046
I'm Dr. Maggie Lin.

09:28.048 --> 09:30.282
You're Maggie? You're Maggie?

09:30.284 --> 09:31.616
You're <i>the</i> Maggie?

09:31.618 --> 09:32.917
The one and only, yeah.

09:32.919 --> 09:33.951
[laughs, groans]

09:33.953 --> 09:35.287
Okay, uh, Mr. Hoffman...

09:35.289 --> 09:37.054
Uh, uh, no touch. [chuckles]

09:37.056 --> 09:39.023
Okay, uh, I'm gonna page Dr. Katz.

09:39.025 --> 09:40.124
No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:40.126 --> 09:42.527
Don't tell her I'm here, okay, please?

09:42.529 --> 09:45.997
[breathes shakily]
I-I just... I think I'm dying.

09:45.999 --> 09:47.965
[breathes heavily]

09:47.967 --> 09:51.002
How'd the femur repair go?

09:51.004 --> 09:52.837
Uh, it didn't.

09:52.839 --> 09:54.172
Sorry about that.

09:54.174 --> 09:55.506
Yeah.

09:56.008 --> 09:57.675
Poor Sean Danes.

09:57.677 --> 10:00.010
Three up and three down
gives me enough purchase

10:00.012 --> 10:01.088
to reduce that spine, right?

10:01.168 --> 10:02.836
Um, yeah.

10:02.886 --> 10:05.174
Just make sure to do a full decompression
before you reduce them.

10:05.224 --> 10:07.386
That's what I figured. Thank you.

10:07.686 --> 10:09.550
[monitor beeps]

10:10.018 --> 10:11.754
Shahir. What are you doing here?

10:11.756 --> 10:13.056
Your patient... Hayden Watts.

10:13.058 --> 10:13.752
What about him?

10:13.819 --> 10:15.258
Well, he also has a subdural hematoma.

10:15.260 --> 10:16.592
I sent you that C.T.

10:16.594 --> 10:18.694
What, are you telling me that
I can't operate on that spine?

10:18.783 --> 10:20.728
No, I'm telling you I'm jumping the line
so I can operate on him first.

10:20.799 --> 10:22.498
Hey, I have to do that decompression.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.829
Shahir, if I don't get in there right away,

10:23.879 --> 10:26.870
- he's never gonna walk again.
- I'm sorry. It's life over limb.

10:28.151 --> 10:30.073
Where you going?

10:30.075 --> 10:31.908
You can't leave Hayden.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.578
Um, he's not my patient.

10:35.580 --> 10:38.448
It was my job to protect him.

10:38.450 --> 10:40.015
You have to do that for me now.

10:40.017 --> 10:42.352
Like I said, he's not my patient.

10:42.354 --> 10:43.853
Is he gonna be paralyzed?

10:43.855 --> 10:45.388
I don't know.

10:45.390 --> 10:52.027
Look, I was the one driving and texting.

10:52.029 --> 10:55.164
This is all my fault.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.367
Okay? Hayden can't be paralyzed.

10:58.369 --> 11:00.769
You have to do something.

11:04.707 --> 11:07.009
[sighs deeply]

11:07.011 --> 11:09.043
Joel, you mind if I have a look at this?

11:09.045 --> 11:10.479
Be my guest.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.648
That's actually a small brain bleed.

11:13.650 --> 11:14.683
Mm-hmm.

11:14.685 --> 11:17.051
If you get in and out of there quick...

11:17.053 --> 11:18.353
How?

11:18.355 --> 11:19.788
The field's gonna be a bloody mess.

11:19.790 --> 11:21.690
I won't be able to visualize
well enough to work that fast.

11:21.692 --> 11:26.327
Yeah, you might with a little,
uh, 3-D assist from Stryker.

11:26.329 --> 11:29.463
Charlie, you are brilliant.

11:29.465 --> 11:31.199
- Shahir?
Shahir: - Hmm?

11:31.201 --> 11:32.633
Give me two hours to decompress that spine

11:32.635 --> 11:33.801
before you fix that brain bleed.

11:33.803 --> 11:35.003
It's a four-hour surgery, Joel.

11:35.005 --> 11:36.670
Not with a NAV unit, it's not.

11:36.672 --> 11:39.040
You can get your hands on a navigator?

11:39.042 --> 11:41.509
If I can, would you give me the two hours?

11:41.511 --> 11:43.010
It's highly unorthodox.

11:43.012 --> 11:45.245
I'll take that as a yes.
[smooches] Thank you.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.881
Yeah.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:57.603 --> 11:58.836
Hi.

11:58.838 --> 12:00.871
I gave Hayden's mom your message.

12:00.873 --> 12:02.207
That's great. Thank you so much.

12:02.209 --> 12:03.874
- How is he?
- Did you guys start your surgery?

12:03.876 --> 12:05.410
- What can I do to help?
- Okay, slow down.

12:05.412 --> 12:07.812
Hayden's in the O.R.
I have some exciting news.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.348
Um, we just got our hands on
some state-of-the-art technology

12:10.350 --> 12:12.550
specifically for Hayden's surgery.

12:12.552 --> 12:13.684
I'm optimistic.

12:13.686 --> 12:15.285
So, he's gonna be okay.

12:15.287 --> 12:17.187
He's in good hands.

12:17.189 --> 12:20.891
Okay. Uh, what about Sean?

12:23.829 --> 12:26.030
Sean didn't make it.

12:26.032 --> 12:27.264
[gasps]

12:27.266 --> 12:29.133
[voice breaking] Oh, my god.

12:29.135 --> 12:32.584
- Uh...
- His injuries were just... too severe.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.638
Does Hayden know?

12:34.640 --> 12:35.537
No.

12:35.587 --> 12:36.679
Don't tell him.

12:36.786 --> 12:38.575
- Listen, I can't...
- No. You don't understand.

12:38.577 --> 12:41.711
If he... if he finds out,
he'll-he'll give up.

12:41.713 --> 12:44.080
Chiti, I have a responsibility to be honest.

12:44.082 --> 12:47.083
Don't tell him...
not until he's better, okay?

12:47.085 --> 12:48.752
Please.

12:51.822 --> 12:54.490
Please.

12:54.492 --> 12:56.960
[breathes deeply]

12:59.329 --> 13:01.464
[sniffles, cries]

13:01.466 --> 13:03.432
Hayden.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.900
Hayden: Hey.

13:04.902 --> 13:07.170
So, when I'm finished,
my colleague Dr. Hamza

13:07.172 --> 13:08.671
is gonna tag in and fix that brain bleed.

13:08.673 --> 13:10.105
Okay.

13:10.107 --> 13:12.608
You know, one more catastrophic
injury for the hat trick.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.477
Okay, you just hang in there, okay?

13:14.479 --> 13:15.778
Your mother's on her way.

13:15.780 --> 13:18.247
Your friend Cheech
is out in the waiting room.

13:18.249 --> 13:19.314
[inhales sharply]

13:19.316 --> 13:21.650
- How's Seanny doing?
- Excuse me?

13:21.652 --> 13:24.687
My buddy Sean... Sean Danes.

13:24.689 --> 13:28.223
I bet he walked out of that
wreck without a scratch on him.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.993
[inhales sharply]
We should get you prepped.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.896
Is something wrong?

13:33.898 --> 13:36.898
We just need to start your surgery, Hayden.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.500
What's wrong?

13:40.703 --> 13:43.471
I'm not doing anything until you tell me.

13:44.473 --> 13:46.474
Is Sean dead?

13:47.443 --> 13:48.810
Just tell me.

13:48.812 --> 13:51.580
H-he's not, okay?

13:51.582 --> 13:53.181
He's gonna be fine, and so are you.

13:53.183 --> 13:54.515
Now, listen to me, Hayden.

13:54.517 --> 13:56.851
If I don't move on this surgery,
you might never walk again.

13:56.853 --> 13:58.753
Do you understand me?

14:02.725 --> 14:05.426
Okay, let's get him, uh,
prepped and tubed, please.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.097
Oh, boy. Now needles.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.265
This day.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.701
Yeah, you and me both. I'm missing lunch.

14:13.703 --> 14:14.935
Come on, Jackson.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.203
Don't tell me you haven't
chaperoned a patient before.

14:16.205 --> 14:18.606
Okay. Then I won't.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.609
I hope it doesn't offend you.
It's just custom.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.477
No. No offense taken.

14:23.479 --> 14:26.146
Well, Sydney says
you get your back up easily,

14:26.148 --> 14:28.081
especially around men.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.383
- She said that?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

14:30.385 --> 14:31.918
Favorite Maggie story is
when you two first met

14:31.920 --> 14:33.153
and you thought she was, um...

14:33.155 --> 14:34.888
I don't think you guys
were even dating then, were you?

14:34.890 --> 14:36.089
Yeah, but I hear it all.

14:36.091 --> 14:37.124
- Mm.
- [chuckles]

14:37.126 --> 14:38.591
You're suspicious of online shopping.

14:38.593 --> 14:39.826
You put butter on meat sandwiches.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.094
Nah. Really, Dr. Lin?

14:41.096 --> 14:43.496
You show promise with your patients

14:43.498 --> 14:44.564
but impatience with your studies.

14:44.566 --> 14:46.031
Mm.

14:46.033 --> 14:48.234
Anyway, I'm sure she goes on
about me, too, right?

14:48.236 --> 14:50.503
Yes. And how. [chuckles]

14:50.505 --> 14:52.905
Huh. Yeah, Sydney was right.

14:52.907 --> 14:55.708
Your nose does kind of twitch
when you're fibbing.

14:55.710 --> 14:58.543
This dude could write a book
about you, Dr. Lin.

14:58.545 --> 15:00.813
- Mm.
- Okay, just a little pinch.

15:00.815 --> 15:01.914
[inhales sharply]

15:01.916 --> 15:03.048
[monitor beeping]

15:03.050 --> 15:04.850
You're right by the ligament of Berry.

15:04.852 --> 15:06.418
Watch the nerve.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.154
Dana, I see it.

15:08.156 --> 15:10.923
You've been backseat-driving
since we started.

15:10.925 --> 15:13.392
[chuckles] You're doing great.

15:13.394 --> 15:14.859
Okay.

15:17.863 --> 15:19.964
Send this to pathology for me, please.

15:19.966 --> 15:22.801
Bet this is the longest
she's ever stayed quiet.

15:22.803 --> 15:25.637
While she's open, we should get
Dawn in for a heart transplant.

15:25.639 --> 15:28.273
Maybe Shahir could do a little lobotomy.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.541
[both laugh]

15:29.543 --> 15:32.610
I don't know how anyone can be
so awful to their kids.

15:34.713 --> 15:36.080
[exhales sharply]

15:36.082 --> 15:38.850
Why haven't you told your mother
that you're pregnant?

15:38.852 --> 15:41.452
[chuckles]
How much time have you got?

15:41.454 --> 15:44.189
Well, you're still
cherry-picking for parathyroids,

15:44.191 --> 15:45.456
so I got time.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.925
Well, she was never very good
at major events...

15:47.927 --> 15:50.093
or minor ones, for that matter.

15:50.095 --> 15:55.566
When my dad died, she, uh...
she never recovered.

15:55.568 --> 15:58.001
Worked at night at the bar,
drank all the time.

15:58.003 --> 16:00.705
I basically
had to raise my brothers,

16:00.707 --> 16:04.007
and there was a revolving door
of boyfriends,

16:04.009 --> 16:08.145
left us with
some pretty unsavory dudes.

16:08.147 --> 16:09.446
Aw, Alex.

16:09.448 --> 16:11.648
She's just gonna make this
all about herself, you know.

16:11.650 --> 16:13.616
She might surprise you.

16:13.618 --> 16:14.818
[chuckles]

16:14.820 --> 16:17.855
Ready to close, Dr. Kinney.

16:17.857 --> 16:19.056
[indistinct talking over P.A.]

16:19.058 --> 16:20.457
I need to talk to you.

16:20.459 --> 16:22.459
Sounds serious.

16:22.461 --> 16:24.627
Herschel's here. I just admitted him.

16:24.629 --> 16:25.995
- No, he doesn't want you to know.
- Why not?

16:25.997 --> 16:27.364
'Cause he doesn't want you to worry.

16:27.366 --> 16:29.366
- Well, should I be worried?
- We don't know yet.

16:29.368 --> 16:31.200
He came in
with severe abdominal pain,

16:31.202 --> 16:32.969
and he's in a C.T. scan as we speak.

16:32.971 --> 16:33.970
Oh, my god.

16:33.972 --> 16:35.672
I just thought you should know.

16:35.674 --> 16:37.806
No. Of course. I have to go see him.

16:39.309 --> 16:41.477
[sighs]

16:41.479 --> 16:43.479
[monitor beeps]

16:43.481 --> 16:46.382
Okay. Start pre-oxygenation.

16:46.384 --> 16:47.683
What for?

16:49.019 --> 16:51.553
Oxygenation at 96%.

16:51.555 --> 16:54.155
Well, we need to construct
a 3-D model of head and spine.

16:54.157 --> 16:56.525
The only way to do that

16:56.527 --> 16:58.727
is to keep him absolutely still
for two minutes.

16:58.729 --> 17:00.896
To make that happen,
he has to stop breathing.

17:00.898 --> 17:02.431
- Won't he de-SAT, sir?
- Heart still beats.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.832
He just won't breathe.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.334
Oxygenation at 96%.

17:06.336 --> 17:07.469
98%.

17:07.471 --> 17:08.737
100%.

17:09.239 --> 17:11.506
Andrea, get me a towel, please.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.508
All right, let's bring that bad boy in here.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.509
Let's spin him.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.169
[inhales sharply]

17:15.219 --> 17:17.587
That's all? We're just gonna leave him
alone in here, not breathing?

17:17.637 --> 17:20.114
Yeah, or you can hang out in here and enjoy

17:20.116 --> 17:21.851
a delicious serving
of radiation, Dr. Larouche.

17:21.901 --> 17:23.511
- The choice is yours.
- Okay, then.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.018
Uh, you don't have to ask me twice, sir.

17:25.143 --> 17:27.688
Turning off vent... now.

17:27.690 --> 17:28.756
[machine beeps]

17:28.758 --> 17:30.157
Let's hit it.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.206
His saturation levels are dropping, Joel.

17:46.208 --> 17:47.707
- He's down to...
- He can handle it.

17:47.709 --> 17:50.010
His lungs are contused.
How long will this take?

17:50.012 --> 17:52.112
It'll take as long as it takes.

17:52.114 --> 17:56.250
Might be the only chance
to save this kid from paralysis.

18:00.254 --> 18:01.955
No. 65. That's it, Joel.

18:01.957 --> 18:04.991
Just a few seconds more. Come on. Hold up.

18:04.993 --> 18:08.394
Tight. This kid can take it.

18:08.396 --> 18:09.863
- Let's move.
- Okay.

18:09.865 --> 18:13.032
Let's clear that field.
Dr. Sharpe, talk to me.

18:13.034 --> 18:16.002
Wayne: SATs at 70, 75 and coming up.

18:16.004 --> 18:17.103
Did we get it?

18:17.105 --> 18:19.605
- What's our accuracy on this?
- 0.34.

18:19.607 --> 18:22.008
I would say
that is a resounding yes.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.815
All righty, let's stabilize the spine

18:29.817 --> 18:31.184
and get some screws in there.

18:31.186 --> 18:33.085
We're back in business, boys and girls.

18:33.087 --> 18:35.153
Let's move.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.923
Your mother's surgery went very well.

18:37.925 --> 18:39.157
Christina: That's good.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.193
We were able to remove
the papillary thyroid tumor,

18:41.195 --> 18:43.228
which was about the size of a plump cherry.

18:43.230 --> 18:45.965
When she tells it, it'll be
the size of a beach ball.

18:45.967 --> 18:48.534
Now, you should know that 3 of the 11 nodes

18:48.536 --> 18:50.768
that we removed were also cancerous,

18:50.770 --> 18:52.937
but she has a very good prognosis, okay?

18:52.939 --> 18:55.140
Alex, I need you now.

18:55.142 --> 18:56.941
Yep. What's up?

18:56.943 --> 18:58.743
Talk to me.

18:58.745 --> 19:00.445
She had some stridor, so I sat her up.

19:00.447 --> 19:01.646
Christina: What's happening?

19:01.648 --> 19:02.981
Your mother has a hematoma.

19:02.983 --> 19:04.483
There's blood clotting between her tissues

19:04.485 --> 19:06.150
and compromising her airway.
She can't breathe.

19:06.152 --> 19:07.318
She's turning purple.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.120
- Mel?
- On it.

19:09.122 --> 19:11.923
Okay. Theresa,
I need to relieve the pressure

19:11.925 --> 19:13.925
so that you can breathe, okay?

19:13.927 --> 19:15.259
[gasping]

19:16.795 --> 19:18.763
- Okay. We good?
- Yeah.

19:18.765 --> 19:20.131
Look away.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.534
[groans]

19:23.536 --> 19:26.170
I need to get her back into the
O.R., and I need more blood.

19:26.172 --> 19:27.505
Blood bank's almost out of O-neg.

19:27.507 --> 19:29.540
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I wish I was.

19:29.542 --> 19:31.275
One of the car-crash victims was also O-neg.

19:31.277 --> 19:32.410
What are the odds?

19:32.412 --> 19:34.778
- Hey, what's your blood type?
- Uh, AB.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.780
- My sister's the same as my mom.
- Are you sure?

19:36.782 --> 19:38.382
Yes, it's about the only thing
they have in common.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.917
But they don't talk anymore.

19:39.919 --> 19:42.719
Okay, well, you need to find her
and get her here <i>now.</i>

19:42.721 --> 19:44.387
Prep an intubation tray.

19:44.389 --> 19:45.455
Theresa: [coughs]

19:45.457 --> 19:46.623
It's okay. Theresa, look at me.

19:46.625 --> 19:47.791
[gasps]

19:50.852 --> 19:52.687
[indistinct talking over P.A.]

19:54.155 --> 19:55.723
Sydney. You found out?

19:55.725 --> 19:57.458
Well, of course I found out,
Herschel. I work here.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.159
[sighs]
Don't get mad at me, please.

19:59.161 --> 20:01.494
I'm not mad. I... [sighs] Are you in pain?

20:01.496 --> 20:03.097
It comes and goes.

20:03.099 --> 20:05.165
I thought the worst would be
one of us getting cold feet.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.834
[knock on door]

20:06.836 --> 20:09.636
I have the results of your C.T.
and blood work.

20:09.638 --> 20:11.939
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

20:11.941 --> 20:16.308
Your blood work confirms
a rise in your B-type symptoms,

20:16.310 --> 20:19.411
your glucose and
white blood cell count are up,

20:19.413 --> 20:21.480
and your iron is down.

20:21.482 --> 20:24.383
Oh, boy. Wow.
That does not sound positive.

20:24.385 --> 20:27.152
There are also some lesions
on your lower intestine.

20:27.154 --> 20:30.256
I'd like to do a biopsy and test the tissue.

20:30.258 --> 20:33.391
Cancer. You're saying I-I have cancer.

20:33.393 --> 20:35.660
- No. We don't know that yet.
- It's cancer.

20:35.662 --> 20:38.263
Oh, god. It's cancer. I knew it.
This is god punishing me.

20:38.265 --> 20:39.697
No. Nobody's being punished.

20:39.699 --> 20:40.799
Dr. Lin, a word.

20:44.682 --> 20:45.871
Spare nothing.

20:45.873 --> 20:47.973
- It's too early to diagnose.
- Maggie, please.

20:50.509 --> 20:52.042
Lymphoma.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.078
Multifocal?

20:54.080 --> 20:55.913
Quite possibly.

20:55.915 --> 20:57.382
I'm sorry, Syd.

20:57.384 --> 20:59.751
[sighs] What was his hemoglobin?

20:59.753 --> 21:01.018
75.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.520
Take it again within the hour.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.255
Yeah, of course.

21:04.257 --> 21:06.257
This is a test.

21:06.259 --> 21:09.827
It's not a punishment. God is testing us.

21:09.829 --> 21:12.930
I'm gonna go be with my fiancé.

21:13.999 --> 21:16.566
Herschel: What did she say?

21:16.568 --> 21:17.812
Joel: Okay, this is the last screw.

21:17.862 --> 21:20.570
Somebody, uh,
give Shahir a call, please.

21:20.572 --> 21:23.674
Yeah. Yep, now we have a start point.

21:23.676 --> 21:25.342
We need to find a safe corridor

21:25.344 --> 21:27.711
away from the spinal cord
and the great vessels.

21:27.713 --> 21:29.913
- Okay. There?
Joel: - There. Yeah.

21:29.915 --> 21:31.581
Okay, could you drop in a virtual screw?

21:31.583 --> 21:32.982
Dave: I'm on it.

21:32.984 --> 21:34.484
45 by 35.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.288
Okay, now we have a target to aim for.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.927
Right. That's the exact part
that the screw needs to go in.

21:40.977 --> 21:42.458
Um, pedicle finder, please, Andrea.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.061
Perfect. Rocker and a blocker for me.

21:45.063 --> 21:46.662
Shahir: I'm impressed, Joel.

21:46.664 --> 21:49.098
I didn't think you'd be able
to do this in two hours.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.366
Get your scans ready, Shahir.

21:50.368 --> 21:53.469
We should be out of here in no time.

21:53.471 --> 21:55.138
[cellphone vibrates]

21:55.140 --> 21:56.339
That's probably Hayden's mother
calling right now.

21:56.341 --> 21:57.840
Uh, Shahir, could you answer my phone?

21:57.842 --> 21:59.274
It's in my pocket. Please.

22:00.410 --> 22:02.511
Is this an engagement ring?

22:02.513 --> 22:04.179
- Hey, could you put that back, please?
- Is this for Alex?

22:04.181 --> 22:06.248
Put it... get the phone, Shahir.
Put that back.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.617
As her birth partner,
I just don't think this is the right time.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.486
Could we discuss this at another time?

22:10.488 --> 22:12.620
Honestly.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.323
Hello?

22:16.092 --> 22:19.761
Y-yes, Mrs. Watts.
This... this is Dr. Goran.

22:19.763 --> 22:24.566
Hayden is still in surgery,
but h-he's doing very well.

22:25.668 --> 22:28.703
Is my mother gonna die?

22:28.705 --> 22:31.339
She suffered a serious
postoperative complication,

22:31.341 --> 22:33.875
but we're doing everything
that we can for her.

22:35.478 --> 22:38.847
I'm not gonna lie. I've thought about it.

22:38.849 --> 22:42.250
But now that it's a reality, it's just...

22:42.252 --> 22:44.159
Lauren, with your blood,
we actually have a chance

22:44.258 --> 22:45.507
that we can get in there
and fix the problem.

22:45.557 --> 22:48.155
It is very good that you came in.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.341
It was as much for my sister.

22:51.560 --> 22:54.728
She gets around my mother,
and she has no voice.

22:54.730 --> 22:56.397
She basically disappears.

22:56.399 --> 22:59.833
[inhales sharply] I can relate.

22:59.835 --> 23:00.935
Really?

23:02.537 --> 23:04.705
I would have guessed
you came from a normal family.

23:06.742 --> 23:09.510
My mother doesn't even know I'm pregnant.

23:04.707 --> 23:06.740
Well, you'd be wrong.

23:09.512 --> 23:10.977
Smart move.

23:11.678 --> 23:16.116
When I told mine,
she pretty much disowned me.

23:16.777 --> 23:21.521
She's met my daughter Lucy
twice, and she's almost 5.

23:21.523 --> 23:23.023
Wow. That's...

23:23.025 --> 23:25.325
Terrible, awful, sad.

23:25.327 --> 23:26.526
Yeah.

23:26.528 --> 23:29.195
My friend seems to think
that my mom's gonna step up

23:29.197 --> 23:30.596
and surprise me, so...

23:30.598 --> 23:33.166
If she's anything like my mom, I
don't think she'll surprise you,

23:33.168 --> 23:37.603
but [sighs] you know who will?

23:37.605 --> 23:40.205
Your kid.

23:40.207 --> 23:42.274
Every single day.

23:42.276 --> 23:44.844
It's the best thing I ever did.

23:46.346 --> 23:47.880
Well, that's two units.

23:47.882 --> 23:49.682
Hospital policy.

23:49.684 --> 23:51.083
You don't have to stop.

23:51.085 --> 23:52.151
I should.

23:52.153 --> 23:54.253
I don't really care about the rules.

23:54.255 --> 23:56.422
Look, she's a monster, but she's my monster,

23:56.424 --> 23:59.691
and I don't want her to die,
so just keep going.

24:01.294 --> 24:03.595
All right, just a bit longer.

24:03.597 --> 24:06.098
Then my juice and my cookie.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.566
Oh, absolutely.

24:07.568 --> 24:09.267
[chuckles]

24:10.837 --> 24:12.236
Blood is blood.

24:12.238 --> 24:14.272
Guess there's no escaping it, huh?

24:17.443 --> 24:18.977
[sighs]

24:18.979 --> 24:21.446
Is this gonna hurt?

24:21.448 --> 24:24.048
I am gonna freeze the area as best as I can.

24:24.050 --> 24:25.583
It's gonna hurt, Herschel.

24:25.585 --> 24:26.617
[laughs]

24:26.619 --> 24:28.752
My future wife's an honest person.

24:28.754 --> 24:31.089
I appreciate that.

24:32.858 --> 24:36.760
I, um... I haven't been as honest with you.

24:36.762 --> 24:39.097
What are you talking about?

24:39.099 --> 24:40.098
Herschel.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.766
Do you mind? Just one second.

24:42.768 --> 24:45.335
There's something I need to tell you. Um...

24:45.337 --> 24:46.403
Herschel.

24:46.405 --> 24:50.073
No, I need to, uh... I need to confess.

24:52.443 --> 24:54.144
Okay.

24:54.146 --> 24:55.445
[sighs]

24:55.447 --> 24:59.416
Just pretend I'm the goyishe
thing behind the curtain.

24:59.418 --> 25:01.818
What's your sin?

25:03.388 --> 25:05.055
I can't. It's...

25:05.057 --> 25:07.491
[breathes deeply]

25:07.493 --> 25:09.126
I ate pork.

25:10.461 --> 25:12.362
You ate pork.

25:12.364 --> 25:13.863
Yeah, at this, um...

25:13.865 --> 25:16.032
this restaurant that I thought was kosher,

25:16.034 --> 25:20.102
but I found out it was not kosher.

25:20.104 --> 25:22.939
The brussels sprouts were made
with-with bacon.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.176
So, you made a mistake.

25:27.178 --> 25:28.678
[chuckles]

25:28.680 --> 25:30.112
[breathes deeply]

25:30.114 --> 25:31.447
Then I went back.

25:31.449 --> 25:33.049
You what? Why?

25:33.051 --> 25:34.483
I don't even know, you know?

25:34.485 --> 25:36.485
I didn't even particularly like the taste.

25:36.487 --> 25:38.287
It was just more like...

25:38.289 --> 25:42.291
it just felt... good to be bad.

25:42.293 --> 25:44.626
I can't believe this.

25:44.628 --> 25:45.894
- Forgive me.
- <i>Forgive</i> you?

25:45.896 --> 25:47.996
I don't even <i>know</i> you.

25:47.998 --> 25:50.165
S...

25:52.068 --> 25:54.235
So, this is it, the afterlife.

25:54.237 --> 25:57.238
You just people-watch,
sit and think your thoughts.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.808
It's a lot like grad school, really.

25:59.810 --> 26:01.543
Just time to think about

26:01.545 --> 26:04.912
all the things I wasted my time
worrying about,

26:04.914 --> 26:07.148
all the stuff that got left unsaid.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.550
[chuckles]

26:08.552 --> 26:11.052
I never did get a rematch
with that douche from eastern,

26:11.054 --> 26:12.220
either.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.189
You an enforcer?

26:14.191 --> 26:15.690
Yeah.

26:15.692 --> 26:18.826
Whenever Hayden was on the ice,
it was my job to protect him.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.260
That's a tough gig.

26:20.262 --> 26:21.528
Some nights.

26:21.530 --> 26:24.732
But sometimes there's nothing
like a good fight.

26:24.734 --> 26:25.733
Yeah?

26:25.735 --> 26:27.301
[chuckles]

26:27.303 --> 26:30.337
Everyone thinks they're looking
for the meaning of life,

26:30.339 --> 26:32.339
but what they're actually looking for

26:32.341 --> 26:34.174
is an experience of life.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.377
Fighting gives you that
better than anything,

26:37.379 --> 26:39.713
except maybe love.

26:41.416 --> 26:43.117
Pretty sharp for a tough guy.

26:43.119 --> 26:44.985
[chuckles]

26:46.721 --> 26:48.622
You in love, doc?

26:48.624 --> 26:50.424
[inhales sharply]

26:50.426 --> 26:51.691
[stammers]

26:51.693 --> 26:53.827
Yeah. Me too.

26:55.096 --> 26:58.464
But the kicker with my situation...

26:58.466 --> 27:01.200
she has no idea.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.338
Your girl know?

27:05.340 --> 27:07.674
[breathes deeply]

27:07.676 --> 27:10.176
It's complicated.

27:10.178 --> 27:11.777
It's not.

27:11.779 --> 27:17.150
I mean, I thought it was...
life, philosophy...

27:17.152 --> 27:20.353
but it turns out...

27:20.355 --> 27:23.088
It's actually remarkably simple.

27:25.125 --> 27:27.225
[tool whirring]

27:27.227 --> 27:30.295
His fibrinogen's low. He needs
a couple of units of FFP.

27:30.297 --> 27:33.032
Okay, he's coagulopathic.
It could mean a rapid
progression of his hematoma.

27:33.034 --> 27:34.066
I need to get in there now.

27:34.068 --> 27:35.768
Fracture's secure. We are almost there.

27:35.770 --> 27:38.403
But I do have power tools within
millimeters of his spinal cord.

27:38.405 --> 27:39.538
[tool whirs]

27:39.540 --> 27:42.807
Now is not the time to rush me, Shahir.

27:42.809 --> 27:45.076
[tool whirring]

27:46.445 --> 27:48.346
And we...

27:48.348 --> 27:49.781
wait.

27:50.983 --> 27:54.519
We are done.

27:54.521 --> 27:56.288
Look at that... on time, too. Well, "ish."

27:56.290 --> 27:57.955
Now what?

27:57.957 --> 27:59.924
We evaluate if he has paralysis or not.

27:59.926 --> 28:01.358
Any objections, Dr. Hamza?

28:01.360 --> 28:05.063
I've been objecting this whole
time, Joel, but you're a cowboy.

28:05.065 --> 28:07.531
And a cowboy is as a cowboy does, so...

28:07.533 --> 28:10.301
So, how do we know
we've done enough to decompress?

28:10.303 --> 28:11.803
We wake him up and see.

28:11.805 --> 28:12.804
[monitor beeps]

28:12.806 --> 28:15.073
Okay. [clears throat]

28:17.512 --> 28:18.913
[indistinct talking over P.A.]

28:18.963 --> 28:20.010
Maggie: Dr. Katz.

28:20.060 --> 28:21.766
You have Herschel's biopsy results?

28:21.768 --> 28:23.768
- Negative for lymphoma.
- Oh, thank god.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.770
It still doesn't explain the lesions.

28:25.772 --> 28:27.004
What else could they be?

28:27.006 --> 28:28.540
Abdominal pain, weight loss.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.275
Well, that could be psychosomatic
from the bacon guilt.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.844
You were a little hard on him.

28:32.846 --> 28:35.079
He broke kosher law, Maggie.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.014
I just mean, considering.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.115
Considering?

28:38.117 --> 28:40.351
He broke his sacred covenant with god.

28:40.353 --> 28:41.852
Maybe you were projecting?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.187
He ate bacon, Maggie!

28:43.189 --> 28:45.957
I just mean that maybe
you were looking for an out.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.192
I never said I wanted an out.

28:48.194 --> 28:49.526
You don't have to.

28:49.528 --> 28:52.563
It doesn't mean the truth isn't
eating away at your insides.

28:54.632 --> 28:55.632
Larvae.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.468
I'm sorry?

28:57.470 --> 28:58.535
Larvae.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.437
It's... it's consistent with abdominal pain,

29:00.439 --> 29:03.106
weight loss,
elevated white blood cell count.

29:03.108 --> 29:05.342
We need to get him in
for a pet scan right away.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.584
Um, Lin, you want to catch me up here?

29:07.634 --> 29:09.101
Rian,
I need you watching the feet.

29:09.151 --> 29:11.666
Uh, could we dim the lights, please, Gloria?

29:11.817 --> 29:13.749
Thank you.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.453
And let's put on some music...
something soft, please.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.122
[chuckles] Setting the mood, huh?

29:19.124 --> 29:20.657
Kid's gonna wake up tied to a table

29:20.659 --> 29:22.358
with a tube down his throat
and his spinal cord open.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.626
Yep. I understand.

29:23.628 --> 29:25.696
Let's do our best to keep it
serene, shall we, children?

29:25.698 --> 29:27.463
[rock music plays]

29:27.465 --> 29:28.598
Gloria: Sorry. Wrong playlist.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.333
Honestly, Gloria?

29:30.335 --> 29:32.435
All right, you ready, Sharpe?

29:32.437 --> 29:34.571
Okay, let's reverse him.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.073
[soft instrumental music plays]

29:42.546 --> 29:44.214
Hayden?

29:44.216 --> 29:46.348
Can you hear me?

29:48.384 --> 29:50.519
Hayden, it's Dr. Goran speaking.

29:50.521 --> 29:54.156
You're still in surgery here.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.325
Now, if you can understand me,

29:56.327 --> 29:59.128
I want you to blink your eyes, okay?

30:02.498 --> 30:05.133
Great. That's great.

30:05.135 --> 30:09.104
Okay. I need you to do
something else for me.

30:09.106 --> 30:12.374
You think you can wiggle your toes, Hayden?

30:12.376 --> 30:15.410
Really try and move your toes, all right?

30:18.681 --> 30:20.514
Okay, Hayden, you can do this, pal.

30:20.516 --> 30:24.018
Keep trying. You got this.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.787
You got it, Hayden.

30:25.789 --> 30:28.056
Wiggle those toes for me, all right?

30:28.058 --> 30:29.490
[inhales sharply]

30:29.492 --> 30:30.925
- Yes.
- He's moving them?

30:30.927 --> 30:32.727
- Yes. Yes.
- That's... that's it.

30:32.729 --> 30:34.462
That's it. You're doing it.

30:34.464 --> 30:37.498
You are doing it. Okay.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.301
Beautiful, beautiful.

30:40.303 --> 30:42.370
What am I even looking at?

30:42.372 --> 30:44.204
Here. Look.

30:44.206 --> 30:46.039
Right here.

30:46.041 --> 30:47.207
You see?

30:47.209 --> 30:49.577
Maggie, tell me that's not
what I think it is.

30:53.214 --> 30:55.816
The good news is you don't have cancer.

30:55.818 --> 30:56.850
I'm not dying?

30:56.852 --> 30:58.018
You're not dying.

30:58.020 --> 31:00.487
[laughs]

31:02.991 --> 31:05.025
Okay. What's the bad news?

31:06.327 --> 31:07.861
You have a tapeworm.

31:07.863 --> 31:09.663
What?

31:09.665 --> 31:14.233
[sighs] It appears the worm
migrated up your esophagus

31:14.235 --> 31:15.935
by your nasal pharynx.

31:15.937 --> 31:17.904
I'm... I think I'm gonna be sick.

31:17.906 --> 31:19.673
Yeah, that makes three of us.

31:19.675 --> 31:22.975
Which means I can retrieve it
through your nose.

31:22.977 --> 31:26.679
You know, um, I think I'd rather
you not stay for this.

31:26.681 --> 31:28.214
Some things can't be unseen.

31:28.216 --> 31:30.883
I thought you couldn't be alone with me.

31:30.885 --> 31:33.452
I think that ship has sailed.

31:37.191 --> 31:38.891
[sighs]

31:38.893 --> 31:41.194
We were able to evacuate the hematoma,

31:41.196 --> 31:43.629
and she survived, thanks to you.

31:43.631 --> 31:46.264
However, there was a bit of a hiccup.

31:46.266 --> 31:48.266
It wouldn't be our mother without one.

31:48.268 --> 31:49.401
During the procedure,

31:49.403 --> 31:51.403
your mother's laryngeal nerves were stunned.

31:51.405 --> 31:52.738
What does that mean?

31:52.740 --> 31:55.474
It's called neuropraxia,
but luckily it's temporary,

31:55.476 --> 31:57.443
so the voice loss won't be permanent.

31:57.445 --> 32:00.345
Wait. You're saying our mother
won't be able to talk?

32:00.347 --> 32:03.148
Not for a few weeks, at least, maybe months.

32:03.150 --> 32:06.384
I thought you said there was bad news.

32:06.386 --> 32:08.586
[laughs]

32:10.689 --> 32:13.291
Hey. Look who's awake.

32:14.426 --> 32:15.926
Theresa,

32:15.928 --> 32:19.731
you've lost your voice... temporarily...

32:19.733 --> 32:21.932
and you are gonna be okay.

32:21.934 --> 32:24.502
You have Lauren to thank for that.

32:27.305 --> 32:29.741
I should go.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.246
Theresa: [claps hands]

32:39.717 --> 32:41.518
You want me to stay?

32:43.588 --> 32:48.759
Okay. I can stay and we can
sit up and you can listen.

32:48.761 --> 32:55.766
You can just listen, Ma, to all
the pain and the disappointment.

32:55.768 --> 32:58.334
You can sit up with us

32:58.336 --> 33:02.939
and just listen to all the hurt
that you've caused us.

33:05.776 --> 33:08.444
You still want me to stay?

33:17.654 --> 33:19.889
All right, then.

33:19.891 --> 33:21.724
[sighs]

33:23.159 --> 33:26.495
Christina, you're up first.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.440
Maggie:
Okay, just open up for me, Herschel.

33:38.442 --> 33:40.008
Uh-huh.

33:40.010 --> 33:41.609
That's just gonna freeze your throat

33:41.611 --> 33:42.844
and keep you from gagging.

33:42.846 --> 33:45.547
Just... okay, chin up,
head back, and try to relax.

33:45.549 --> 33:47.749
That's not entirely likely.

33:47.751 --> 33:49.151
[sighs]

33:49.153 --> 33:50.185
Okay.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.429
Hang in there.

34:01.431 --> 34:03.331
[inhales sharply] There it is.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.332
Ah.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.968
Just needs a little coaxing.

34:06.970 --> 34:09.270
Okay.

34:09.272 --> 34:11.005
[inhales sharply]

34:11.007 --> 34:13.373
Relax.

34:13.376 --> 34:15.109
Oh. I'm sorry.

34:15.110 --> 34:16.277
[inhales sharply]

34:16.279 --> 34:18.179
Okay, breathe. Mouth.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.581
[both exhale sharply]

34:22.250 --> 34:24.685
[groans]

34:27.522 --> 34:29.889
Breathe.

34:29.891 --> 34:31.658
- [exhales sharply]
- Okay.

34:31.659 --> 34:33.560
[breathing heavily]

34:33.562 --> 34:34.795
Tissue?

34:34.797 --> 34:36.329
Thank you.

34:36.331 --> 34:38.498
[groans]

34:38.501 --> 34:40.300
[siren wailing]

34:40.302 --> 34:42.402
[indistinct conversations]

34:46.806 --> 34:48.074
How is he?

34:48.076 --> 34:50.543
The surgeries went well.

34:50.545 --> 34:52.411
He's in recovery.

34:52.414 --> 34:54.313
Oh, my...

34:54.315 --> 34:56.382
Thank you.

34:56.385 --> 34:57.617
I...

34:57.619 --> 35:00.452
I-I don't know what I would have done.

35:00.454 --> 35:03.355
[voice breaking] I love him so much.

35:03.357 --> 35:05.457
I can see that.

35:05.459 --> 35:10.029
And the thought of losing him just...

35:12.032 --> 35:14.199
Can I be there when he wakes up?

35:14.201 --> 35:15.868
Joel: Yeah. Of course you can.

35:15.870 --> 35:17.869
So, that's the girl you're in love with?

35:22.042 --> 35:24.209
Could have fought for her.

35:24.211 --> 35:25.610
I couldn't.

35:25.612 --> 35:27.979
Hayden was my best friend.

35:32.618 --> 35:35.687
So, no regrets?

35:37.322 --> 35:39.724
You have to choose
who you're gonna fight for

35:39.726 --> 35:41.225
and then fight hard

35:41.227 --> 35:44.563
and don't stop
until they're dragging you away.

35:44.565 --> 35:48.433
I fought for Hayden. That was my choice.

36:03.368 --> 36:06.141
I have never been more
embarrassed in my life.

36:06.143 --> 36:07.709
You'll be fine.

36:07.711 --> 36:10.473
Dr. Lin's keeping you overnight
just to be safe.

36:10.523 --> 36:12.013
Ah. You know,
you were right about her.

36:12.015 --> 36:13.148
She has something else.

36:20.322 --> 36:22.456

36:22.768 --> 36:25.042
[breathes shakily]

36:25.092 --> 36:26.894
I can't marry you.

36:27.562 --> 36:29.330
I know.

36:31.199 --> 36:33.200
I broke kashruth.

36:33.202 --> 36:35.336
[inhales sharply]

36:35.338 --> 36:37.204
Now I only have god to answer to.

36:37.206 --> 36:38.939
No, it's not you or god.

36:38.941 --> 36:41.175
It's me.

36:45.933 --> 36:48.105
I'm gay.

36:48.716 --> 36:50.818
[chuckling] You're... you're gay?

37:04.198 --> 37:07.794
Uh... who knows about this?

37:07.844 --> 37:10.876
Just you... and Maggie.

37:10.926 --> 37:13.206
Why does Maggie know?

37:13.656 --> 37:15.274
Maggie knew?

37:16.444 --> 37:18.477
And you and her...

37:18.479 --> 37:20.479
Herschel...

37:20.481 --> 37:22.748

37:30.415 --> 37:31.657
I'm sorry.

37:32.681 --> 37:38.868
I just know I can't be part of
our community and still be me.

37:38.971 --> 37:40.733
And you were mad about the bacon?

37:43.202 --> 37:45.471
Aren't you scared?

37:47.106 --> 37:48.841
Yeah.

37:50.042 --> 37:53.544
But I'm more scared of the life
I'll have if I stay.

37:54.896 --> 37:57.403
Then I think you should leave.

37:58.465 --> 38:00.185
- What?
- I'd like you to leave.

38:00.780 --> 38:02.453
Well...

38:02.455 --> 38:04.622
- No, I...
- No, just-just go.

Please.

The insurance form.

You filled all of them out.

39:01.279 --> 39:02.645
That's incredible.

39:34.148 --> 39:35.892
You're following your heart.

39:36.401 --> 39:38.913
I feel like I'm free-falling.

39:39.675 --> 39:41.516
Oh, I know the feeling.

What do I do now?
