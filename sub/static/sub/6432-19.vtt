00:01.000 --> 00:02.764
Previously on
Warehouse 13...

00:03.469 --> 00:04.960
I have cancer.

00:07.407 --> 00:10.035
You are
the Count of St. Germain.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.943
An alchemist, used a stone
to keep my body from aging.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.776
Myka!

00:14.848 --> 00:15.974
Sutton...

00:16.049 --> 00:18.210
My lying, cheating husband

00:18.284 --> 00:20.650
is once again out in the world.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.210
But I have plans, too.

00:22.288 --> 00:25.189
A 15-year-old-boy?
- Nick Powell.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.257
Why don't you come back
to South Dakota with us?

00:27.327 --> 00:29.420
Is everything all right?
I'm in, aren't I?

00:29.496 --> 00:30.690
Nick broke into
the Warehouse

00:30.764 --> 00:32.095
and released one of
the Bronze Sector prisoners...

00:32.165 --> 00:34.133
- A guy named Paracelsus.
- The alchemist.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.430
He destroyed the bronzer.
And look...

00:36.503 --> 00:38.471
This is Claudia.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.270
Four
score and seven years ago...

01:23.850 --> 01:25.613
I have a dream...

01:25.685 --> 01:27.846
One giant leap for mankind...

01:27.921 --> 01:30.321
Tear down this wall.

01:33.326 --> 01:36.124
It's brilliant.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.262
I understand now.

01:42.569 --> 01:44.867
Thank you
for freeing me, Nicholas.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.604
The centuries

01:48.675 --> 01:51.166
pass slowly when
you're encased in bronze.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.769
Mother and I tried many times
to free you but...

01:54.948 --> 01:56.973
No one knows better than I

01:57.050 --> 01:59.575
what an inconvenience
the Warehouse can be.

01:59.652 --> 02:02.314
But no longer. We only
ask one thing in return.

02:02.388 --> 02:05.448
I would have thought
immortality was trade enough.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.058
Oh, we've been ageless
for far too long, uncle.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.220
Ah!

02:09.294 --> 02:12.492
We want... I... I have
to live out my life.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.226
Nothing can be done,
until we are...

02:17.770 --> 02:20.102
All right, I'm sorry,
but I can't read lips.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.697
I can't see.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.366
How could there be
nothing in the system

02:23.443 --> 02:25.536
about why Paracelsus
was bronzed?

02:25.612 --> 02:27.671
I don't know. I just
figured he's some kind of

02:27.747 --> 02:30.875
Lex Luthor-Joker-
Doctor Doom-mash-up.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.851
I mean, the Warehouse only bronzed
the baddest of the baddies.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.978
H.G. Wasn't a baddie.

02:35.054 --> 02:37.818
Oh, yeah, now. But she did
try and blow up the world

02:37.891 --> 02:40.724
which is the number-one
criteria for an arch nemesis.

02:40.793 --> 02:42.283
Pete, look at this.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.291
Sutton's ring
and Genghis Khan's mace

02:45.365 --> 02:46.923
and a bunch of other
artifacts are missing.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.025
Yeah. I'm just going to stick
with super villain mash-up.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.095
Hey! Don't break her.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.867
Yeah, thank God you said that

02:53.940 --> 02:55.805
because, you know, breaking
her, that was our big plan.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.001
You fixed it?

02:57.076 --> 02:58.941
Just be glad that they didn't
destroy this whole thing.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.536
So, why do you think they
took her out of there?

03:00.613 --> 03:02.012
Were they gonna try
and bronze someone else?

03:02.081 --> 03:03.480
I don't know.
You know, who might know?

03:03.550 --> 03:05.541
You. If you keep using
the Durational Spectrometer.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.313
We also may be able to
figure out where they went.

03:08.955 --> 03:11.423
Okay, yeah, we're just...
Uh, okay.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.425
Whoa!

03:14.494 --> 03:16.155
You don't need lips
to read that.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.229
Ready to go.
Let's give this a try.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.165
That didn't work, Artie,
she's still bronze.

03:30.243 --> 03:31.301
Yeah, I know,
I can see that.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.072
It just needs a reset.

03:36.616 --> 03:37.844
Yeah...

03:37.917 --> 03:40.112
That's probably just,
you know, a loose wire,

03:40.286 --> 03:42.049
something electronic or...

03:42.121 --> 03:43.986
It could be
something far worse.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.388
Artie, what is it?

03:45.458 --> 03:46.755
Yeah, it's gone.
What's gone?

03:46.826 --> 03:49.021
The artifact that makes
this bronzer work.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.258
It's a bronze Mesopotamian
stele from 1250 BC.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.926
And, no, we do not
have another one.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.935
So then, how do
we un-bronze Claudia?

03:57.003 --> 03:58.903
Artie! What is that?

04:00.039 --> 04:03.406
Judging from the smell, I'd say it was a
chemical reaction triggered by light.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.874
When I opened this panel.

04:04.944 --> 04:05.933
What the hell?

04:06.012 --> 04:07.502
It's a message from Paracelsus.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.105
Sutton's involved. Why
does it not surprise me?

04:10.183 --> 04:12.378
So, Paracelsus has
the bronzer stele

04:12.452 --> 04:14.579
and he's holding it till he gets
whatever it is that Sutton has.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.451
Yeah.
That's not a message.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.954
It's a ransom note.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.608
You know, there's really
no reason to restrain me like this.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.735
I'm not going anywhere.
And this thing...

04:38.945 --> 04:40.572
Chafes.

04:41.581 --> 04:44.709
The Folsom Prison ball and chain
is attached to your shadow,

04:44.784 --> 04:46.911
not your person.
It doesn't chafe.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.581
But you're absolutely right.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.986
You're not going anywhere.

04:50.056 --> 04:52.524
No more games. Where's
Paracelsus and your son?

04:52.592 --> 04:53.820
I don't know.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.190
They weren't supposed to leave.

04:55.261 --> 04:57.286
Yeah, well.
He bronzed our friend.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.887
So forgive us for
not believing you.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.432
But that was not
part of the plan.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.092
Nicholas liked Claudia.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.829
You know what, lady, I'm...
You know what?

05:03.903 --> 05:07.771
What if Nick bronzed
Claudia against his will?

05:08.041 --> 05:10.134
Paracelsus
did slap him pretty hard.

05:10.209 --> 05:11.733
Paracelsus struck my son?

05:11.811 --> 05:14.405
In you urgency
to free Paracelsus,

05:14.514 --> 05:17.005
you neglected to factor
in one volatile element,

05:17.417 --> 05:19.647
Paracelsus! That's why
Nick had the gun.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.846
I told him not to
underestimate...

05:23.956 --> 05:26.390
I should have
un-bronzed Paracelsus...

05:27.160 --> 05:28.752
Myself.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.825
Password? Year I was born. 1502.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.833
I would have guessed, 1508.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.061
What's your secret?

05:36.135 --> 05:37.966
Oil of Olay?
No messages.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.670
Call him. Speed dial is "N."

05:40.173 --> 05:42.664
Seriously.
Pilates, sunscreen...

05:42.909 --> 05:45.139
Straight to voicemail.
Something's happened then.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.236
Paracelsus made
plans of his own.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.110
Now he's got two hostages.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.649
Why don't we start with this?

05:50.883 --> 05:53.113
Why did you get involved

05:53.186 --> 05:56.553
with the most dangerous
rogue alchemist in history?

05:56.622 --> 05:58.556
Paracelsus was,

05:58.624 --> 06:00.717
is, Sutton's brother.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.219
As you know, he had a rather

06:03.563 --> 06:05.531
heretical approach to, well,

06:05.598 --> 06:06.929
pretty much everything.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.591
Pushed the boundaries
of science,

06:08.668 --> 06:11.262
and combining that science
with artifacts.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.202
Multiple artifacts.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.297
Just a few moments.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.037
Step into the chamber.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.910
By your command, dear brother.

06:26.085 --> 06:28.553
The wine? You've drugged me.
Why?

06:28.621 --> 06:32.022
I was already playing your
guinea pig for a reasonable fee.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.456
What the hell is
my family doing here?

06:36.529 --> 06:38.053
Have you lost your mind?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.793
This was only
supposed to be me.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.300
Let them go.
You don't need them.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.427
Oh, but you're wrong
my dear brother. I do.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.701
I must test my theory on a
man, a woman and a child.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.373
How else would I determine

06:49.442 --> 06:51.876
whether gender
or age alter the process

06:51.944 --> 06:53.343
or the result.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.779
I'll see that
your fee is tripled.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.004
And you
woke up immortal.

07:20.139 --> 07:25.076
Paracelsus combined the Philosopher's
Stone with another artifact.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.738
With a copper bowl with the
Egyptian symbol for life.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.578
That's as dangerous as replacing
gunpowder with nuclear fission.

07:30.683 --> 07:31.945
So, what happened next?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.509
Not long after,
Paracelsus disappeared.

07:34.887 --> 07:37.617
We later found out that
agents from Warehouse 9

07:37.690 --> 07:39.317
had taken him.
And they bronzed him.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.791
Why?
No idea.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.483
I've watched my son

07:42.562 --> 07:45.463
trapped in an endless
adolescence of broken hearts.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.325
The first was the most painful.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.130
Her name was Sophia.

07:50.770 --> 07:54.137
They were just two 15-year-olds in love.
What could be more natural?

07:55.074 --> 07:57.099
Nick stayed 15 and...

07:58.144 --> 08:00.237
Sophia grew up.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.809
She married, she had children and she
forgot all about her first love.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.646
But Nick never forgot her.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.020
That was the first time that I
saw the cruelty of immortality.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.685
Centuries caught
between child and man.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.352
Never to fall in love,

08:16.429 --> 08:17.987
raise a family,

08:18.064 --> 08:19.861
share your life with someone.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.099
And worse, watching
your loves age and die.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.531
He knows only loss.

08:29.308 --> 08:34.575
But the heart is strong and it
takes a long time to give up hope.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.182
Nick fell in love again...

08:38.851 --> 08:41.751
And again, until finally
he understood

08:41.821 --> 08:44.688
that there would be no one
to love for all eternity.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.291
That's why you want
mortality for your son.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.892
But the Philosopher's Stone
isn't enough, is it?

08:49.962 --> 08:52.021
You need Paracelsus
to reverse it.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.865
And he's got to use
the same mixture

08:54.934 --> 08:57.960
of artifacts and elements
he did the first time.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.665
You un-bronzed him. Even though
you knew he was dangerous?

09:00.740 --> 09:03.766
We assumed he would be weak after
all that time, and grateful.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.108
I mean, some things are worth
risking everything for.

09:07.179 --> 09:08.578
And my son is one of them.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.206
Artie, I'm assuming
that Paracelsus

09:10.283 --> 09:12.217
is going to try to use
the Stone on himself.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.721
Where would Paracelsus find
those specific elements?

09:15.788 --> 09:18.279
We assumed in his laboratory
in Constantinople.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.654
Istanbul, today.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.161
Call me crazy, but after
500 years I'm going to bet

09:23.329 --> 09:25.320
that it's been made
into condos by now.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.660
Well, we have to try.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.597
Where exactly in Istanbul?

09:28.668 --> 09:30.158
We were drugged
when we were taken there.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.170
Deep underground somewhere.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.139
Well, we can't just go diggin'
holes all over Istanbul

09:35.207 --> 09:37.300
Wait a minute.
Paracelsus' message said,

09:37.376 --> 09:39.708
"Sutton knows what I want."

09:39.779 --> 09:41.747
If Sutton knows
what Paracelsus wants...

09:41.814 --> 09:43.509
Then Sutton would know
where to find him.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.016
Any idea where you husband is?

09:45.084 --> 09:46.745
Oh, I've given up
keeping track of Sutton

09:46.819 --> 09:49.310
after Napoleon put a price on his head.
It's just...

09:49.922 --> 09:51.549
Too dangerous.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.887
Come on!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.323
The old boy's been there
for, like, 11 hours.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.799
Well, you know, it takes time.
Needle in a haystack.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.961
Maybe he needs some help.
Really? You're gonna...

10:05.037 --> 10:07.267
Put your hand
in the lion's cage?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.035
No, no! No! No!

10:09.108 --> 10:10.700
Good point.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.140
So, while we're at it,
why don't we, uh...

10:17.917 --> 10:20.681
Why don't we talk about why you
haven't started your treatments yet?

10:20.853 --> 10:22.218
What treatments?
Myka...

10:22.688 --> 10:24.212
Your cancer treatments

10:24.290 --> 10:26.520
which you should have
started, like, yesterday.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.288
Look. That's why I didn't
tell anyone about this. Okay?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.023
This is...
This is my disease.

10:31.097 --> 10:35.090
And it's my treatment program and I will start
it when I'm good and ready to start it.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.260
You're really telling me
how to handle my own body?

10:37.336 --> 10:40.100
No. It's just you can't
just "handle" cancer.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.037
- Look, I got this under...
- I got it!

10:44.377 --> 10:45.742
I got it! I got it!

10:46.278 --> 10:49.179
This system has been
maddeningly slow.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.306
Okay.
But...

10:50.383 --> 10:52.874
Using Sutton's last known
whereabouts, which was Paris,

10:52.952 --> 10:55.648
I started with Interpol and then video
from Charles de Gaulle Airport.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.780
And then, I widened the net.
Artie!

10:57.857 --> 10:59.017
Long story short.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.254
The Count is posing as
a Russian businessman

11:02.328 --> 11:04.728
named Vladimir Kamenev.

11:05.865 --> 11:07.856
Natter Weekly?
Yes, Natter Weekly.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.527
It's utterly reliable. How do
you think we found Jimmy Hoffa?

11:10.603 --> 11:12.161
- Really?
- Shh.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.103
Okay. The Count
is in Luxembourg.

11:16.175 --> 11:19.008
And Natter says that
he is "quite chummy"

11:19.078 --> 11:21.410
with an incredibly
rich duchess.

11:21.614 --> 11:25.209
According to Natter, the Duchess is
throwing an elaborate dinner party.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.582
So dust off your formal wear,

11:27.653 --> 11:29.245
and off to Luxembourg you go.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.221
Take Charlotte with you.
Wait, Charlotte?

11:31.290 --> 11:33.986
Yes, Charlotte. Charlotte knows
her husband better than anyone.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.960
Just keep an eye on her.
Go, go, go, go.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.188
Okay.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.397
Artie, get down to
the Bronze Sector, now.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.113
I think she's getting worse.
Worse than bronzed?

11:58.184 --> 12:01.119
Yeah. The Farnsworth, it's crumbling.
And that's not normal, right?

12:01.187 --> 12:04.247
No, the bronzer. It was built
to stabilize the stele artifact

12:04.323 --> 12:06.757
and create a bronzed state
for the prisoners

12:06.826 --> 12:09.351
who would remain alive, and...

12:09.428 --> 12:11.521
That's why we didn't find her
inside the bronzer.

12:11.597 --> 12:14.088
Paracelsus
must have bronzed her

12:14.166 --> 12:16.726
outside the machine,
using just...

12:16.802 --> 12:18.360
The stele.
What does that mean?

12:18.437 --> 12:20.735
Her bronzed state is unstable.

12:20.806 --> 12:22.205
If we don't find the artifact

12:22.274 --> 12:24.765
or find a way to reverse
Claudia's disintegration

12:24.844 --> 12:27.836
then eventually
She's just gonna...

12:29.215 --> 12:30.341
Crumble away.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.428
Lots of bronze files.
We got Bronze Age,

12:46.499 --> 12:48.228
Bronze Era,

12:48.300 --> 12:50.825
Bronze...
Couldn't you...

12:52.171 --> 12:53.968
Phosphor Bronze.
Arsen... Arsen...

12:54.039 --> 12:56.030
What the hell?
Come on.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.009
Okay, Bronze Color,
Bronze Properties,

13:00.079 --> 13:01.171
Bronze Cop...
I...

13:01.247 --> 13:03.181
I got this. All right?
What, you've got this?

13:03.249 --> 13:04.511
Yes. There's, like,
a gazillion files

13:04.583 --> 13:07.211
that have something to do with bronze...
There are 6,083 files.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.686
Well, 6,083 files that you
can't get through alone.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.245
I don't plan to
get through them alone.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.621
What I plan to do is use
an algorith... Artie.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.461
Mrs. Frederic.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.357
You're here.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.954
Yes, I am.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.961
Mrs. Frederic?
Yes, Arthur?

13:25.604 --> 13:27.231
Why are you here?

13:29.408 --> 13:31.000
There's something here.

13:31.076 --> 13:33.408
There's something of...

13:33.612 --> 13:35.944
Yeah. I was hoping
to correct that before.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.414
You know what? I have
something to show you.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.547
Tell me more about Paracelsus.
That's all we know.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.721
Warehouse 9 wouldn't have
bronzed him without reason.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.555
Well, whatever they
had on Paracelsus,

13:48.627 --> 13:49.992
they didn't keep
any records of it.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.723
I must access
the restricted files.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.497
The what?
There are restrict...

13:53.566 --> 13:55.295
There are restricted files?

13:55.367 --> 13:57.699
Of course, only the Regents
in their infinite wisdom

13:57.770 --> 13:59.795
would have restricted files so
we couldn't access... Arthur!

14:01.473 --> 14:02.770
Not now.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.944
Yeah. Call me if
there's any change.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.502
Artie, Artie.
What?

14:09.415 --> 14:12.043
She didn't just disappear,
she walked away.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.354
Walked.
Yeah.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.893
Okay, I got this. Act natural.

14:26.966 --> 14:28.957
- I am acting naturally.
- Good, good.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.992
Where is the little weasel?

14:31.070 --> 14:32.901
Oh, just
follow the money.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.534
There.

14:37.276 --> 14:40.302
He looks a lot better than
he did the last time we saw him.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.404
A lot more alive.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.211
Thank you all so much
for joining us this evening.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.516
I am going to let you in
on our little secret.

14:48.787 --> 14:50.778
This isn't just a party.

14:51.156 --> 14:53.420
It's an engagement party.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.427
Vladimir and I
are going to be married.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.032
My future Duke.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.469
Not again, he's been
someone's future duke,

15:04.536 --> 15:08.370
earl, count, marquis,
12 times in five centuries.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.375
Yeah, well, maybe he thinks eventually
he can trade them all in for king.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.539
So why do this?
The lonely hearts con.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.604
Get engaged to
a wealthy noblewoman.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.276
Stage a fancy party and then she
gets out all the family jewels.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.410
"Family jewels."

15:21.587 --> 15:23.452
So he can steal them?
Yes.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.123
And afterwards,

15:25.190 --> 15:27.658
he'll use them
to do a Thai gem scam

15:27.726 --> 15:30.217
or a rip deal.
Oh, God! He's so predictable.

15:30.296 --> 15:34.062
You know what? I'll bet he's that
Nigerian prince that keeps emailing me.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.727
No, not you.
No. Hey! Not you.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.630
Sutton will be making off
with the gems tonight.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.104
We can't lose him.
Okay.

15:41.173 --> 15:44.108
Pete? You circle around...
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

15:46.912 --> 15:49.506
I told you we should
have worn moustaches.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.349
You're saying
the restricted files

15:54.420 --> 15:56.183
are kept in the storage room?

15:56.255 --> 15:58.086
Is it a storage room?

16:10.169 --> 16:11.796
Do you mind?

16:17.109 --> 16:18.701
It's nice to know

16:18.777 --> 16:21.473
that even grumpy, jaded
Arthur Nielsen

16:21.547 --> 16:24.607
can still be surprised
by endless wonder.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.688
I believe I said,
"restricted."

16:36.428 --> 16:38.259
Yeah, no. I'm not offended.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.125
No. No.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.860
I'm fine.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.027
Trey, you could go in,
you're a Methodist.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.920
There you are.

17:11.396 --> 17:13.262
Wait a minute.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.459
Yeah, this could
be a possibility.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.229
Artie! She's getting worse.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.496
Again? How much worse?

17:18.569 --> 17:20.731
More crumbling and faster. Took
an hour for the Farnsworth,

17:20.806 --> 17:22.068
now there's cracks
starting everywhere.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.768
Not her yet, but it's
just a matter of time.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.776
64A.
64A?

17:25.844 --> 17:28.074
Yeah, that's four down.
Two from the left.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.815
Hook her onto that,
it'll monitor her vitals.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.579
Meanwhile, I'll keep
looking into this.

17:33.652 --> 17:34.846
Well, look into what?
What is it?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.911
You want a seminar or
do you want to save her? Go!

17:39.091 --> 17:40.615
Forgive me, darling.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.853
But I haven't had you
to myself for hours.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.761
Perhaps your entourage would be so
kind as to give us some privacy.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.890
We'll be fine.
Wait for me downstairs...

17:51.737 --> 17:55.833
The formal announcement has left
me rather unexpectedly amorous.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.672
Vladimir, you rogue.
That I am.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.509
To us, my darling.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.047
To us.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.015
To us. Hmm.

18:08.487 --> 18:10.114
Whoo! Ooh!

18:10.189 --> 18:12.749
The bubbles went
straight to my head.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.292
You must lie down.

18:14.359 --> 18:15.849
I'll join you.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.726
Perhaps, we could think of something
to do while you're down there.

18:20.165 --> 18:22.360
Let me help you
get more comfortable.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.369
Hold it right
there, Count Sticky Fingers.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.829
Who are you? We're with
the Secret Service.

18:27.906 --> 18:30.534
We're here to extradite
your fiance to the US.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.236
He's been
a very bad boy.

18:32.311 --> 18:33.835
Some folks back home
want a piece of him.

18:33.912 --> 18:37.211
No, you can't.
Can't. Can't!

18:37.282 --> 18:39.250
I believe I have a say in this.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.615
Her timing's not bad.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.779
And who are you?
I'm his wife.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.085
And I say,
to hell with extradition.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.098
The files from
Paracelsus were redacted

19:03.175 --> 19:05.109
by the Regents of Warehouse 9.

19:05.177 --> 19:07.975
It's most unusual. I feel left out.
Tell me about it.

19:08.046 --> 19:10.344
I beg your pardon? Um... Nothing.
It's not important.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.579
I'll have to contact Mr. Kosan.
Good.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.119
Yeah. Bit of
a ticking clock, you know?

19:21.193 --> 19:23.787
If Sutton is a dead end,
those files, they could

19:23.862 --> 19:27.059
be a clue to finding Paracelsus.
Mrs. Frederic!

19:28.767 --> 19:31.235
Yes, the files were redacted.

19:31.303 --> 19:33.271
I'll have to contact
Mr. Kosan.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.040
He's dead!

19:42.114 --> 19:43.945
My fiance is dead!

19:49.555 --> 19:51.216
Sorry, love. Long story.

19:55.694 --> 19:56.683
Oh!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.900
Pete! Myka! He's gone.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.472
Oh, man!

20:11.543 --> 20:14.444
How many times are we going to let
him die and sneak off like that?

20:14.513 --> 20:16.174
Okay, Charlotte,
you just stay here.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.113
And don't shoot anyone else.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.793
I'm just gonna
monitor your vitals.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.897
You know, it's uh...

20:36.935 --> 20:38.425
It's kind of weird
me doing all the talking.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.368
And, no.
I don't like it, I...

20:40.872 --> 20:42.430
I miss your constant chatter.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.542
Don't worry.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.009
Claud, we're going
to get you out of this.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.237
After all the times
that you've saved us.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.183
Oh, my God. Pete!

20:52.251 --> 20:53.684
Argh!

20:54.653 --> 20:56.086
I cast you out!

21:02.561 --> 21:04.859
Hey.  Oh, my God.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.129
After all the times
you've saved us,

21:10.202 --> 21:12.329
you'd never let us hear the end of
it if we didn't save you, right?

21:12.938 --> 21:15.133
And according to this,
your vitals are...

21:16.508 --> 21:18.703
Not responding.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.108
Artie, for crying out loud!

21:24.149 --> 21:25.980
How did you hear me?
What?

21:26.051 --> 21:27.951
No, look. I think I can
boost her genetic material

21:28.020 --> 21:29.612
on a cellular level.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.781
And that will help her
fight deterioration.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.347
But I'm going to need DNA.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.359
Well, her toothbrush.
Or a hairbrush.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.758
No, I need a blood sample.

21:36.828 --> 21:38.420
From a family member.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.587
You've reached
the voice mail of Josh.

21:40.666 --> 21:41.860
- Leave me a message.
-  Yeah.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.730
Joshua, this is Artie, again.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.030
Listen, I have left
you messages

21:45.103 --> 21:46.570
on every number that you have.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.663
Will you call me back please?
This is urgent.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.901
Artie, her shoes and jacket
are starting to crack.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.273
And I can't get her vitals.

21:52.344 --> 21:54.141
Don't worry.
I will find Joshua.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.713
Hey, you've reached
the voice mail of Josh...

22:02.020 --> 22:04.215
Oh, Joshua, call me back.
Joshua, call me back.

22:04.289 --> 22:06.587
Please, don't make me do this.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.684
Hey!
Look out!

22:09.761 --> 22:11.729
Hey! Hey!
Make a hole! Make a hole!

22:11.797 --> 22:12.786
Stop him!

22:12.964 --> 22:13.953
Oi! Oi!

22:14.199 --> 22:15.188
You there.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.459
Those two!
They're intruders.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.998
They just attacked the Duchess.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.181
Got him! I, uh, guess we
crashed the party, huh?

22:49.568 --> 22:50.557
Did you see Mrs. Frederic?

22:51.136 --> 22:52.501
Yes, I just left
her at the B&B.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.402
Yeah. Well she was a little
unfocused this morning,

22:56.475 --> 22:57.601
but she's gotten worse.

22:58.143 --> 22:59.770
And if I didn't know any better
I'd say she was developing

22:59.845 --> 23:01.244
some kind of dementia,

23:01.446 --> 23:03.607
and rapidly. I don't think
she can help us anymore.

23:03.682 --> 23:05.013
The only thing we can
do for Claudia now

23:05.250 --> 23:08.515
is to find out what is in
those Paracelsus files.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.176
Come with me.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.191
No, no, no, no. Didn't
Mrs. Frederic tell you?

23:14.259 --> 23:16.523
The files have been redacted.
They're not there.

23:16.595 --> 23:18.256
There's something more urgent.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.595
Something we need to check.

23:26.772 --> 23:29.240
This is the Eldunari, the
Warehouse's central nervous system.

23:29.307 --> 23:31.867
This is what makes
the mind of the Caretaker

23:32.711 --> 23:34.645
link with the soul
of the Warehouse.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.138
The Eldunari.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.446
The symbols are
moving in harmony.

23:39.317 --> 23:40.306
That's a relief.

23:46.124 --> 23:47.489
Are they supposed
to be doing that?

23:50.829 --> 23:52.023
No, they're not.

23:56.134 --> 23:58.034
The slow computer,
Mrs. Frederic's condition...

23:59.938 --> 24:02.532
Something's tearing apart the
Warehouse from within its heart.

24:04.009 --> 24:05.135
Yes, I'm afraid so.

24:06.611 --> 24:10.274
Mrs. Frederic's mind
is a mirror of the Eldunari.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.047
It seems

24:14.119 --> 24:15.586
that both of them
are deteriorating.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.094
What is it with you two?

24:29.167 --> 24:30.657
In five minutes
I'd have had the jewels.

24:31.336 --> 24:32.428
You're a common thief.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.905
I am not common.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.339
All right, look. We
don't want to see you either.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.412
We need your help. You
crashed my engagement party

24:41.480 --> 24:42.970
and shot me because
you need my help?

24:43.081 --> 24:45.481
Watch you tone, darling. Or next
time I'll shoot you in the face.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.577
Your brother
bronzed our friend

24:48.720 --> 24:50.620
and he won't release her
till he gets what he wants.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.483
Paracelsus? Impossible.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.188
He's basted in bronze himself.

24:54.459 --> 24:56.825
It's ironic since he's the one who
perfected the bronzing process.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.759
That's how he knew what
made the bronzer work.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.456
Yeah.

25:00.532 --> 25:03.023
Well, somebody let him out.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.593
He took the bronzing
artifact with him.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.328
How could you be so stupid?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.906
Well, you did this to us.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.203
And as I've told you
for half a millennium,

25:12.410 --> 25:13.775
it was only supposed to be me.

25:14.312 --> 25:15.574
I didn't even believe
he could do it.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.281
Sutton, Paracelsus
took Nicholas.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.582
He says you know what he wants.

25:21.319 --> 25:22.684
Revenge springs to mind.

25:23.388 --> 25:24.616
Among other things.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.987
My brother was consumed with
the idea of being immortal.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.496
And what immortals
could accomplish.

25:31.796 --> 25:35.391
I was foolish enough to think him
eccentric rather than insane.

25:37.168 --> 25:38.294
What did you do to us?

25:38.503 --> 25:39.629
I gave you a gift.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.668
A gift that not
even God can give.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.398
Immortality.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.173
You shall live forever.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.736
You in turn showed me

25:48.813 --> 25:50.337
that the Philosopher's
Stone works.

25:50.415 --> 25:51.507
Are you mad?

25:51.583 --> 25:53.551
Waving some rock around
didn't make us immortal.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.277
But it did.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.817
Good God!

26:05.196 --> 26:07.960
I must have killed the three of
you a dozen times when you slept.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.057
I didn't think it possible.

26:10.001 --> 26:10.990
Anything is possible,

26:11.603 --> 26:12.592
at a cost.

26:12.971 --> 26:15.405
It took an entire village to
turn the three of you into gods.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.234
You killed them?

26:17.475 --> 26:19.306
Well, all great achievement
comes at a price.

26:19.477 --> 26:20.637
Socrates was executed.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.680
Magellan died proving
the world was round.

26:22.814 --> 26:24.645
They gave their own lives,
not the lives of others.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.850
The more fool them.
Now get out.

26:28.853 --> 26:30.047
He was brilliant.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.551
But lived in his own
moral universe.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.618
To kill an entire village...

26:35.627 --> 26:37.618
I didn't know what
his endgame was

26:37.696 --> 26:39.630
but I wouldn't allow
him to cause more death.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.759
I went to the authorities.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.192
But it was the agents of
Warehouse 9 who collected him.

26:45.337 --> 26:46.895
What is this?
How dare you?

26:47.305 --> 26:48.329
What are you doing in here?

26:48.406 --> 26:51.466
After he was bronzed the Regents
wanted the Philosopher's Stone.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.168
But I told them
it had been destroyed.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.945
I wouldn't destroy it
in case we needed it again.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.244
So I split it
and hid the two halves.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.951
You took a crystal
from inside the geode.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.023
Your ring! That's how
you restored plants

27:06.091 --> 27:07.388
as the Count of St. Germain.

27:07.792 --> 27:08.884
A fellow has to eat.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.388
That little trick
helped me pay my bills.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.329
Oh, as if you've
ever paid a bill.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.864
Touche!
So, you have the ring?

27:16.034 --> 27:18.332
No, they have the ring.
They took it from me in Paris.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.638
No, Paracelsus has the ring.
You have the Stone.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.066
Half the Stone.

27:23.174 --> 27:24.198
The Warehouse
found the other half

27:24.275 --> 27:25.606
and lost it to pirates.

27:25.677 --> 27:26.666
Until I found it.

27:26.878 --> 27:28.641
So you have the Stone.
No, they have the Stone.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.346
They have the Stone? You just
said you have the Stone.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.607
No, I said they have the Stone.
Okay, okay, just stop...

27:33.885 --> 27:34.874
Talking.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.123
Tell me that you know
how to get to your half.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.754
Of course.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.358
I have it locked safely away.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.987
I want my son away from him.

27:46.731 --> 27:49.859
My brother had some plan in mind
back then, but I interrupted.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.367
He's bound to go at it again.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.604
He's already killed hundreds.

27:54.205 --> 27:55.229
He'll kill us and anyone else

27:55.306 --> 27:57.240
who gets in the way
of his science.

27:57.308 --> 27:58.866
Yeah, well, first
we have to find him.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.199
He'll go to his lab.

28:00.278 --> 28:02.143
After 500 years,
it's still there?

28:02.580 --> 28:05.777
It's deep beneath the monastery
in Stoudios, in Constantinople.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.085
The monastery's in ruins but
the lab is still intact.

28:09.387 --> 28:10.513
You've been there, haven't you?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.153
Hmm.

28:24.102 --> 28:25.967
Claud, are you there?

28:27.672 --> 28:29.003
This setup belonged
to Barry Seal.

28:29.074 --> 28:31.065
He was a pilotldrug smuggler

28:31.142 --> 28:32.769
who flew covert
missions for the CIA.

28:33.078 --> 28:35.569
Oh, my God!
Steve, can you hear me?

28:37.015 --> 28:39.313
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Claud, loud and clear.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.477
Are you okay? Over.

28:43.088 --> 28:44.612
You mean aside
from being the Tin Man

28:44.689 --> 28:46.179
in a bronze production
of The Wizard of Oz,

28:46.257 --> 28:47.246
I'm just peachy.

28:47.325 --> 28:48.986
What's going on?
Where's Paracelsus?

28:49.060 --> 28:50.152
And why am I melting?

28:50.528 --> 28:52.587
Well, technically
you're crumbling.

28:53.131 --> 28:55.224
I am working a Wizard of
Oz motif here, Steve.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.664
God, why am I gayer than you?

28:58.036 --> 28:59.628
Oh, hold on a sec, okay?

29:02.841 --> 29:04.741
Look, I can't reach Joshua.

29:04.809 --> 29:06.606
I know where he is,
it's not far

29:06.678 --> 29:08.839
but it's a high security
facility, so no cell service.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.004
Is there any way
to contact him?

29:10.181 --> 29:11.443
Well, not by phone
but don't worry,

29:11.516 --> 29:13.245
I'm gonna get
the DNA right now.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.307
Okay.

29:16.354 --> 29:17.343
Claud...

29:17.489 --> 29:19.013
Hey, you're, uh,
your bronze state

29:19.090 --> 29:20.352
isn't stable.
It's disintegrating.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.154
But Artie thinks he can
use DNA to help you.

29:22.227 --> 29:23.660
He's on his way
to Joshua right now.

29:24.129 --> 29:25.756
Joshua's DNA
can un-bronze me?

29:25.997 --> 29:27.430
No, no, but...

29:27.599 --> 29:30.090
But Artie thinks he can use
it to stop the deterioration.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.403
I feel this weirdness
in my nerve endings.

29:32.570 --> 29:33.662
Is it getting worse?

29:40.979 --> 29:42.003
No.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.809
No, you just hang
in there, Claud.

29:56.528 --> 30:00.191
This monastery's been destroyed and
rebuilt at least a dozen times.

30:00.265 --> 30:03.257
I mean, how did you keep
Paracelsus' lab intact?

30:04.569 --> 30:05.866
Bribery and coercion.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.205
I've been trying for
centuries to find a way

30:08.273 --> 30:09.763
to undo what Paracelsus did.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.240
You're not the only one
who loves our son.

30:27.292 --> 30:28.589
It's not much farther.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.557
Main lab is just
around this corner.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.667
Probably best if we come
at him from both sides.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.628
Pete, you and Charlotte
go this way.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.103
Sutton and I will loop around.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.264
Each team has half a Stone

30:42.340 --> 30:44.331
so if anyone gets caught
we have bargaining power.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.038
Good luck.

30:52.650 --> 30:53.912
No!

30:54.285 --> 30:55.411
Nick?

30:55.920 --> 30:56.944
Hey!

30:57.455 --> 30:58.547
Charlotte, wait.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.630
Mykes.
Hey!

31:07.699 --> 31:09.690
I lost Sutton. He heard the scream
and he thought it was Nick.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.028
So did Charlotte. We got to find
them before Paracelsus does.

31:12.470 --> 31:13.835
Right. This way?
Yeah.

31:18.643 --> 31:20.133
Oh, my God, Pete!
Look at this place.

31:23.381 --> 31:24.507
The bronzing artifact.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.014
Pete, look at this.

31:26.517 --> 31:29.611
It's the Cavalry cross, the
tree of life and the ouroboros.

31:30.121 --> 31:32.919
Life out of death.
I bet there's a pattern...

31:33.591 --> 31:34.819
I'll grab the stele.

31:35.159 --> 31:36.251
Pete, wait.

31:36.327 --> 31:37.817
You think that's a...

31:38.897 --> 31:39.886
A trap?

31:40.198 --> 31:41.290
Pete!

32:23.241 --> 32:24.230
Okay.

32:25.910 --> 32:27.207
Okay, I think I found
something that will help.

32:27.345 --> 32:28.812
Not as good as DNA, but...

32:29.047 --> 32:30.173
Maybe enough
to save your haircut.

32:30.381 --> 32:31.678
Wait, my haircut's in danger?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.346
Maybe not, but I liked you
better with short hair.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.086
I've been trying
to grow it out.

32:39.524 --> 32:41.287
Well, at least it hasn't
started on your nose yet.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.657
Oh, you're not trying
to grow that out, are you?

32:43.728 --> 32:46.322
Whatever's happening,
I think it's speeding up.

32:46.397 --> 32:48.126
I, I can't feel
my legs anymore,

32:48.266 --> 32:49.358
my chest is starting to hurt.

32:49.434 --> 32:51.197
So how about you hurry up
with the slowing down.

32:51.436 --> 32:52.767
I figured
that you're oxidizing.

32:52.837 --> 32:54.805
So, I brought the binnacle
from the USS Squalus.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.464
It's a submarine
that sank in 1939.

32:56.541 --> 32:57.974
Now, a lot of the men survived

32:58.042 --> 32:59.907
40 hours on a minimal
amount of oxygen.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.070
So, I figure I'm gonna
use the binnacle

33:01.145 --> 33:03.010
to suck all the oxygen
out of the bronzer,

33:03.081 --> 33:04.343
slowing down
your deterioration.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.315
Jinksy, I'm impressed!

33:06.384 --> 33:07.612
Take it to periscope depth.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.377
Let's give it a try.

33:22.533 --> 33:23.659
Damn it!

33:24.102 --> 33:26.195
Steve. Oh, tell me
that you got it.

33:26.537 --> 33:27.799
I got it.
Okay.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.161
Hang in there, Claudia.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.101
I got the blood sample,
atomized the DNA.

33:45.256 --> 33:46.723
Okay.
Now we just watch

33:46.858 --> 33:49.053
and hope and you know, pray.

33:54.932 --> 33:56.024
Phew!

33:57.268 --> 33:59.065
Claud! Claud!
Artie stopped it.

33:59.303 --> 34:00.565
Woo-hoo!
I didn't stop it.

34:01.139 --> 34:03.403
I just delayed it
about 14 hours or so.

34:03.641 --> 34:06.633
Hopefully long enough for Myka
and Pete to snag the stele.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.353
Ah!

34:17.955 --> 34:19.047
Pete!

34:19.322 --> 34:21.257
Pete, wake up.
Where is he?

34:21.692 --> 34:22.920
Who? Where is he?
Where did he go?

34:23.194 --> 34:25.525
Where'd who go?
Paracelsus.

34:25.862 --> 34:27.728
He was...
He was here.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.128
Oh, no, Mykes.
Mykes, the Stone...

34:30.201 --> 34:32.032
The Stone... He's got the Stone.
What?

34:33.471 --> 34:34.802
How did he, uh... How
did he get in here?

34:34.871 --> 34:36.362
I don't know. I don't know.
I conked out.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.136
How do we get out of here?

34:39.143 --> 34:40.235
Same way we got in.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.150
Nick, is that you?

34:54.192 --> 34:55.181
Nick!

34:56.761 --> 34:57.750
God!

34:59.363 --> 35:00.796
Five hundred years together

35:00.865 --> 35:02.924
and still the perfect
little family.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.160
You bastard!

35:05.203 --> 35:06.500
Mother, don't, don't...

35:06.804 --> 35:08.032
It's Coleridge's fishing net.

35:08.306 --> 35:10.035
He has far more dangerous
artifacts than that.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.370
Listen to your son, Charlotte.

35:11.709 --> 35:12.767
He's a bright lad.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.348
Now...

35:42.373 --> 35:44.603
What was once mine
is mine again.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.215
Be good and quiet.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.615
And I'll make you mortal again.

36:04.962 --> 36:06.429
Breathe, my little lab rats.

36:16.607 --> 36:19.132
For centuries
I was encased in bronze.

36:20.244 --> 36:21.472
Unable to think

36:22.380 --> 36:23.938
about a thing
except my revenge.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.680
If you hadn't gone
to the authorities,

36:27.752 --> 36:28.776
my dear brother,

36:28.886 --> 36:30.615
the Warehouse would
never have found me.

36:30.821 --> 36:33.346
And things would have turned
out very differently.

36:33.524 --> 36:34.889
You took everything from me.

36:35.993 --> 36:37.290
Now I'll take
something from you.

36:42.233 --> 36:43.564
- Not Nick!
- No!

36:46.504 --> 36:48.062
Hey! Drop that!

36:52.910 --> 36:54.502
The Warehouse is
always so clever.

36:55.513 --> 36:56.707
But never clever enough!

37:09.894 --> 37:11.225
- You, okay, Mykes?
- Yeah, go!

37:12.263 --> 37:14.026
Not so fast,
Senator Palpatine!

37:15.700 --> 37:17.429
Look, Sutton, Nick,

37:17.501 --> 37:19.196
just try and get Charlotte
out of here, okay?

37:19.270 --> 37:20.430
I have to go get the stele.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.343
No! Charlotte?

37:32.149 --> 37:33.138
Nick?

37:33.451 --> 37:35.851
Hey, Sutton! Hey, you
guys are mortal now.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.144
Falling buildings hurt.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.620
Hold on,
Mother, just hold on.

37:42.793 --> 37:43.851
Oh, my God!

37:50.601 --> 37:51.829
Guys, this whole
place is collapsing.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.199
We've got
to get out of here.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.429
I'm sorry, love.
I'm so sorry.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.303
I thought we had
much more time.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.209
It's all right.
Just go.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.335
Just go.
Get out of here.

38:02.546 --> 38:03.808
No, no, Mother.
We can do this.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.815
I am sorry,
but we have got to go.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.007
I'm not leaving her.

38:07.084 --> 38:10.850
Oh, yes, you can. Just for
once, just listen to me.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.719
Look after our son.

38:16.761 --> 38:17.853
Please.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.691
It's what we've wanted.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.999
It's what we've worked
for all these years.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.532
You've got a life.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.601
Live it now.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.107
Hey, I got the stele.
We should...

38:37.982 --> 38:40.075
Pete, is she... Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.210
Nick, Sutton, I'm so sorry

38:42.286 --> 38:44.652
but we have to go. We are
running out of time.

38:44.722 --> 38:45.916
We have to go now!

38:45.990 --> 38:47.252
- Let's go!
- Nick!

38:49.093 --> 38:50.082
Mother.

38:51.762 --> 38:52.786
Nick, go.

38:54.699 --> 38:55.757
Go!

39:06.143 --> 39:07.303
I have spoken with the Regents.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.879
And we agree that the
danger Paracelsus presents

39:11.749 --> 39:13.614
requires us to
uncover what had been

39:13.684 --> 39:15.379
permanently expunged
from the Warehouse files.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.647
How...
How can we...

39:17.722 --> 39:20.919
As you know, information of this
nature is held by the Keeper.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.055
The one person
in each generation

39:23.127 --> 39:25.186
who learns vital parts
of Warehouse history

39:25.329 --> 39:27.627
and maintains them
in a living memory.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.589
Yes, the Keeper.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.826
The failsafe for highly
classified secrets.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.838
We must meet him at once.
There's no need.

39:37.074 --> 39:38.268
The Keeper is here.

39:40.644 --> 39:41.736
I'm sorry, Irene.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.812
It was necessary for my
identity to remain a secret.

39:46.584 --> 39:48.711
I understand. There's
no need to apologize.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.756
This is a lei niho palaoa.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.587
Once worn by Hawaii's
Queen Kaahumanu.

39:57.361 --> 40:00.194
The ancestral hair
that was used to braid it

40:00.264 --> 40:02.255
holds the memories
of past Warehouses.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.927
And only the Keeper
can release them.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.217
In the early days
of Warehouse 9,

40:21.252 --> 40:22.913
the alchemist Paracelsus

40:22.987 --> 40:24.716
was becoming
a dangerous threat.

40:25.122 --> 40:26.521
Not only to the Warehouse

40:26.924 --> 40:28.289
but to all of mankind.

40:28.793 --> 40:31.956
It was therefore necessary for
the Regents of Warehouse 9

40:32.296 --> 40:33.729
to take action.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.077
Oh, my God!
It worked, you're back!

40:50.314 --> 40:51.645
You okay? Here, Claud, here.
Let me help you.

40:51.715 --> 40:52.807
Uh-huh. Yeah.
You want my coat?

40:52.883 --> 40:54.646
Here take my coat.
Oh! Okay.

40:57.154 --> 40:58.416
We could have lost Claudia.

41:00.691 --> 41:04.127
So, I'm not gonna
let you ignore it anymore.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.623
Ignore what?
You heard Sutton.

41:07.565 --> 41:08.998
He thought they
had so much time.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.226
I mean,
hell, we all do.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.236
We... We think we have all the
time in the world, but we don't.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.669
We just don't.

41:17.842 --> 41:19.434
You have...

41:20.644 --> 41:21.633
Cancer.

41:23.514 --> 41:24.845
And you need to get
it taken care of.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.974
Because I'm not gonna
play that scene, Myka.

41:27.084 --> 41:28.642
I'm not gonna
regret all the years

41:28.719 --> 41:30.243
that I didn't get
to spend with you.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.081
Okay.

41:35.192 --> 41:36.284
Okay.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.988
I'll book an appointment
with my doctor, okay?

41:39.730 --> 41:40.890
All right.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.594
Just don't. Okay?

41:44.668 --> 41:47.296
Because I really, I don't
want to cry right now.

41:47.571 --> 41:48.663
So...

41:49.573 --> 41:50.733
Okay.

41:52.376 --> 41:53.365
Just go.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.604
I'll go.
Okay.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.437
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine, guys. Really.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.005
And, Artie, please
take your coat.

41:59.083 --> 42:00.072
Smells like old cookies.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.613
Claud...

42:01.919 --> 42:03.386
What is it?
Something's wrong.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.615
It's not the bronzing. I...

42:05.990 --> 42:07.184
It's the Warehouse.

42:07.725 --> 42:09.818
Paracelsus, I can feel
something about him.

42:10.127 --> 42:12.322
You're feeling the peripheral
effects of the same thing

42:12.396 --> 42:13.988
that's affecting me
quite strongly.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.660
The Eldunari? How?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.032
Two Caretakers vying
for the Warehouse.

42:20.271 --> 42:21.363
I'm in a battle.

42:22.273 --> 42:23.262
And I'm losing.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.275
But you and Claudia coexisted
peacefully for a long time.

42:26.343 --> 42:28.436
Ms. Donovan's relationship
with the Warehouse

42:28.512 --> 42:29.570
is in the future.

42:30.247 --> 42:31.407
This is about the past.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.141
And the past takes precedence.

42:33.951 --> 42:35.612
Paracelsus was Caretaker.

42:36.587 --> 42:37.611
Of Warehouse 9.

42:37.688 --> 42:39.485
And as he gains strength
I am...

42:40.558 --> 42:42.651
I will...

42:43.294 --> 42:44.420
Mrs. Frederic!
