WEBVTT

00:38.054 --> 00:39.928
Stop! Stop!

00:43.142 --> 00:44.601
Did your car run off the road?

00:44.685 --> 00:47.473
I don't think so. I was buried.

00:48.272 --> 00:50.099
- Buried?
- Back there.

00:50.191 --> 00:51.816
Ellie, call 911!

00:53.903 --> 00:55.278
- No.
- Easy.

00:55.863 --> 00:58.734
Easy. I just want to get you in the car.
It's warm.

00:59.075 --> 01:00.403
What's your name?

01:01.244 --> 01:02.524
I don't know!

01:03.037 --> 01:05.908
You're in shock.
You'll remember in time.

01:06.290 --> 01:08.164
There isn't any time.

01:12.088 --> 01:13.499
There's a bomb!

01:13.589 --> 01:16.341
- A what?
- A bomb on a ship! A Navy ship!

01:17.093 --> 01:18.801
People are gonna die!

01:19.011 --> 01:20.554
People are gonna die!

02:00.871 --> 02:02.697
U.S. Farm Report.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.873
America's longest-running
agribusiness news programme.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.296
- Gibbs.
- Hey, boss. Rise and shine.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.011
It's 0520.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.219
It's all you get. I'm up.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.803
Are you at the office?

02:21.892 --> 02:24.299
Yeah, boiler blew in my apartment.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.808
So, knocked out the power.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.973
I won't have any heat or electricity
for a month.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.273
Fall asleep working on your boat again?

02:31.359 --> 02:33.566
Why do you say that, DiNozzo?

02:34.070 --> 02:37.404
Boss, I know the Farm Report
when I hear it.

02:37.866 --> 02:40.321
You only have one TV,
and it's in your basement.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.541
What do you got, DiNozzo?

02:47.626 --> 02:49.998
Motorist picked up a Jane Doe
in Rock Creek Park.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.542
Claimed she dug herself out of a grave.
No ID.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.745
And guess what?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.917
She can't remember her name.

02:56.468 --> 02:58.045
Yeah, how'd you know that?

02:58.136 --> 03:01.339
Well, she's alive
and you're calling her "Jane Doe."

03:01.431 --> 03:02.711
What was my first clue?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.892
Yeah, guess you're right.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.847
Well, it's also obvious
that she has no ID,

03:07.938 --> 03:09.977
so she was probably
wearing her uniform.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.395
She wasn't!
So why did the cops call NCIS?

03:14.486 --> 03:15.897
Tell me that.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.531
She told them
there's a bomb on a Navy ship.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.733
Hospital?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.365
Georgetown University.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.700
Get Kate over there.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.324
I'll call Ducky
and meet you outside the office in 20.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.162
Okay. Hey, listen. Since,

03:32.253 --> 03:34.607
you know, you're always up all night
working on your boat downstairs...

03:34.631 --> 03:37.667
No, you cannot stay at my place.
Remember the last time?

03:43.765 --> 03:44.844
Big corn yields.

03:44.933 --> 03:48.266
I talked with him about it the other day,
asking for a little bit of advice.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.140
He says, "Producers,
you ought to be willing to change."

03:56.528 --> 03:59.731
- It's not very deep.
- Hastily-dug graves rarely are.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.815
Do you know why graves
are six feet deep, Gibbs?

04:01.908 --> 04:02.939
I do.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.074
Yeah, six feet is the minimum depth

04:05.161 --> 04:07.949
at which the smell
of a decomposing corpse

04:08.039 --> 04:10.162
cannot attract wild animals.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.711
Of course, there are exceptions.
A polar bear can smell...

04:13.795 --> 04:15.871
Duck, I said I knew.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.548
- Sorry.
- No tracks.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.337
Whoever buried her

04:21.428 --> 04:23.919
may have parked on the street,
used the hiking trail.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.053
Park rangers circle hourly at night, so,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.452
he'd have had to move pretty fast
if he parked on the road.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.802
Well, that goes
with the shallow-dug grave.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.888
Our digger was in a hurry.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.521
Okay, let's get to work.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.569
I don't have a body.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.565
Go find one, Duck.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.115
- Here?
- Sure.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.659
How many times
have we had multiple victims?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.905
Quite right, Jethro.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.080
- That's slick, boss.
- What's that?

04:54.919 --> 04:58.869
Getting Ducky off, so he wouldn't bug us
with one of those stories about the...

05:00.592 --> 05:02.798
We'd better get back to work.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.723
Now, her amnesia can be rooted
in a number of causes.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.727
She suffered a blunt force trauma
to the cranium.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.054
There was some
petechial haemorrhaging, which is...

05:15.148 --> 05:16.559
Whoa! "Petechial"?

05:16.649 --> 05:20.184
I'm sorry.
Pinpoint haemorrhaging on her eyelids.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.354
It's from a lack of oxygen.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.991
She came close to suffocating
in that grave?

05:27.077 --> 05:28.239
Very close.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.486
And, as if the physical traumas
weren't enough,

05:30.580 --> 05:34.447
one has to consider the, you know,
emotional trauma of being buried alive.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.744
That would shake me up.

05:36.836 --> 05:40.881
It's one of our oldest fears,
next to being eaten by a wild animal.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.050
Hadn't considered that one.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.839
Well, you know,
perhaps not consciously, you know.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.921
Jung postulated that

05:48.014 --> 05:50.470
we genetically inherited
our primordial fears

05:50.558 --> 05:53.643
which can be triggered
by smells or sounds.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.388
I'll never forget my first trip to Africa.
There was a moment...

05:57.482 --> 06:00.602
Are you by any chance related
to a Dr Mallard?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.231
Mallard? No, I don't think so.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.978
Just wondering.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.615
When will she regain her memory?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.324
Well, it could happen in a flash

06:08.409 --> 06:11.944
or slowly over a period of days,
weeks, even months.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.865
Now, her memory of being buried
may never return.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.239
Where are they taking her?

06:17.335 --> 06:19.956
For a CT scan and neurological consult.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.510
No, you will not put her picture on TV.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.631
I really think...

06:32.725 --> 06:35.098
I want whoever did this
to think she's still dead.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.811
But, Gibbs, her eyes...

06:36.896 --> 06:38.805
- No, Kate. No.
- But listen...

06:38.898 --> 06:42.184
- Our priority is finding the bomb.
- Right, but we can't...

06:43.111 --> 06:44.190
She's bonded.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.105
- Kate and Jane Doe?
- Oh, yeah.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.071
She hasn't even questioned her yet.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.284
"Her eyes, they just pleaded for help."

06:52.912 --> 06:54.454
I love that look in a woman.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.208
- I couldn't find a body.
- Sorry.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.292
How did you two do?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.252
Found a couple of arrowheads.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.792
Yeah, this one's an arrowhead,
but this one's a shark's tooth,

07:08.887 --> 07:11.460
and, oh, not more than
a few thousand years old.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.513
- That recent?
- Oh, yes.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.435
Any older and it would be black
and fossilised.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.520
- How did it get into Rock Creek Park?
- Pre-Columbian Indians.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.894
You know, they either found
a dead shark on shore

07:21.983 --> 07:24.854
or procured it from a Casimiroid tribe.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.693
- Oh, we have to notify ARPA.
- After we're done here.

07:28.781 --> 07:33.408
Come on, Gibbs. It's a $250,000 fine
for disturbing an archaeological site.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.775
- Crime site first, Duck.
- You know, I was just thinking.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.870
Since the arrowhead
and the shark's tooth were here

07:37.957 --> 07:39.665
before Jane Doe was buried...

07:40.210 --> 07:41.324
Never mind.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.373
Yeah, wouldn't it be fascinating
if our Jane Doe

07:44.464 --> 07:49.007
was unknowingly interred
atop a prehistoric burial?

07:49.093 --> 07:51.252
It happened to me once before,
you know.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.213
In '68. Or was it '67? No matter.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.601
I appreciate your letting me do this.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.681
I'd like to know who I am, too.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.941
I'll need your clothes.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.689
My clothes?

08:07.779 --> 08:09.736
If you handled explosives,

08:09.822 --> 08:13.191
our forensic people will find
particles in your clothing.

08:13.451 --> 08:14.779
Of course.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.319
Can I have your right hand, please?

08:21.209 --> 08:24.660
- Think I've done this before.
- If so, that's good news.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.705
- You'll be on somebody's database.
- FBI's terrorist list.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.424
You have to stop thinking like that.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.999
How am I to think?

08:32.095 --> 08:35.546
I know there's a bomb on a Navy ship
and I put it there.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.174
- Do you remember placing it?
- No. But I know it's there.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.558
Well, knowing it's there
doesn't mean you placed it, does it?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.976
No, I suppose not.

09:03.835 --> 09:04.997
What is it?

09:06.170 --> 09:09.207
I remember being in a church.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.174
Which church?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.593
I don't know.

09:20.560 --> 09:25.387
We found a 40-75 calibre bullet
lodged in the Comanche's femur.

09:25.857 --> 09:30.317
Now, since the 40-75 cavalry carbine
was introduced in 1873,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.859
we have an approximate date
to work with.

09:33.364 --> 09:37.907
Speaking of dates to work from,
we've worked together for two years

09:37.994 --> 09:40.283
and, you know,
I have no idea where you live.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.574
Well, I'd just as well
we kept it that way, Tony.

09:43.750 --> 09:44.912
Right.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.631
Well, hello.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.674
Another artefact?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.430
Only if your pre-Columbians used keys.

10:02.643 --> 10:05.514
So, I suppose you want me to find out
what chastity belt this opens?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.064
Do I look like DiNozzo?

10:07.482 --> 10:10.483
Not funny, boss.
Besides, I could open a chastity belt.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.110
Have you ever seen one?
Mine's awesome.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.903
It's 18th century French.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.103
You have a chastity belt?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.736
So much more information
than I need to know about Abby,

10:17.825 --> 10:19.367
and not enough about this key.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.076
The key opens a magnetised lock.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.661
Instead of serrations,
magnets repel magnetised pins.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.576
- Hotel room?
- Possibly.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.625
But it could be any high-security lock.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.661
There's no logos or serial numbers,
but a magnetic code is like a fingerprint.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.085
So, it'll lead me back

10:34.175 --> 10:36.547
to whatever system
made the code on the key.

10:36.636 --> 10:41.013
Hospital called. The rape kit's negative.
Anything on her prints or clothing?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.886
Nothing on the fingerprints yet,
but the gas chromatograph

10:43.976 --> 10:46.052
should give me something
on her clothes soon.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.770
Hey, how was your interview?

10:49.232 --> 10:50.690
It's sad, Gibbs.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.811
But she's trying so hard.
She desperately wants to help.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.109
I'm glad,
but did she remember anything?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.949
She did. She thinks that
she's been fingerprinted before.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.408
Terrorist.

11:01.077 --> 11:03.568
And she remembers praying in church.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.697
She's not the terrorist type, Tony.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.201
So you're thinking more
Emma Thompson than Angelina Jolie?

11:10.670 --> 11:11.832
Got a whoop.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.127
What kind of whoop, Abby?

11:15.800 --> 11:16.998
Abby?

11:17.427 --> 11:21.294
Okay, this hit is Erythritol.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.714
It's used in low-carb sweeteners.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.966
And this spike is Trimethylene.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.685
It's found in polyester fibres.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.557
Dinitrate is a common
angina medication.

11:30.648 --> 11:34.017
And this is glycol,
and glycol is antifreeze.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.901
So, Jane Doe uses low-carb sweetener,
wears polyester,

11:37.989 --> 11:40.610
puts her own antifreeze in her car
and has a heart condition?

11:40.700 --> 11:44.994
Or she's mixing up a brew
to go boom big time.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.288
All these chemicals
are used in high-grade explosives.

11:55.857 --> 11:57.684
I don't know which is worse,

11:57.776 --> 12:01.227
not knowing who you are,
or knowing you're a terrorist.

12:01.362 --> 12:04.150
The chemicals on your clothing
do not make you a terrorist.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.529
I told you they have other uses.

12:08.244 --> 12:09.988
My heart's fine.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.371
I hate polyester.

12:13.124 --> 12:14.998
I don't like artificial sweetener.

12:15.085 --> 12:17.207
- How do you know?
- I just know.

12:17.754 --> 12:19.960
Like, I know.

12:20.423 --> 12:23.626
I don't like strawberries,
but I love blueberries.

12:24.052 --> 12:26.922
I know what I like
and what I don't like, Agent Todd.

12:27.013 --> 12:31.011
I just don't know who I am,
what I do, or where I live.

12:31.101 --> 12:35.015
Okay. Let's say the residue
was from the explosives.

12:35.563 --> 12:38.730
It could have come
from a legitimate occupation.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.891
What, I'm an explosiver Hersteller?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.238
Explosiver Hersteller.

12:47.450 --> 12:50.617
That means "explosive maker"
in German.

12:50.870 --> 12:54.037
- How do I know that?
- Maybe it's your job title.

12:56.251 --> 12:57.531
No.

12:57.627 --> 13:00.248
Okay, maybe it's a German firm here.

13:00.839 --> 13:04.254
If you worked in Germany,
you would know the language.

13:04.676 --> 13:06.419
You realise what this can mean?

13:06.511 --> 13:09.263
Yeah, it means that
I could have put a bomb on a Navy ship.

13:09.347 --> 13:12.798
Or you know who did
and they tried to kill you.

13:13.977 --> 13:15.305
You think?

13:15.687 --> 13:16.766
I do.

13:17.272 --> 13:19.478
Why do you believe in me?

13:19.941 --> 13:21.768
Why do you like blueberries?

13:23.862 --> 13:26.613
I can't release a woman who
doesn't know her name, Agent Gibbs.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.655
What did the neurological consult say?

13:28.741 --> 13:32.110
She's in no medical danger,
but she doesn't know who she is,

13:32.203 --> 13:34.908
where she lives,
her phone number, anything.

13:34.998 --> 13:37.868
- I can't release her.
- Yes, you can, Doctor.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.955
- Tell them, Maureen.
- My name's Maureen Ingalls.

13:41.045 --> 13:43.999
I live at 620 Niagara Street
in Alexandria.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.961
I don't think I ever remember
my phone number.

13:47.051 --> 13:49.127
You remember who buried you?

13:49.971 --> 13:53.138
She may always block that memory.
Isn't that right, Doctor?

13:53.224 --> 13:55.300
Yes. See, most traumatic amnesiacs

13:55.393 --> 13:57.931
never recall the event
which triggered the memory loss.

13:58.021 --> 14:00.642
In fact, I had a case where there were
three accident victims...

14:00.732 --> 14:02.771
What if her attacker returns?

14:02.859 --> 14:05.480
She'll be in protective custody,
at my place.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.977
So, you'll assume responsibility
for signing her out?

14:08.072 --> 14:09.152
Of course.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.696
I still suggest she stays here
another 24 hours,

14:12.202 --> 14:13.993
but since she's recovered
her memory, I...

14:14.078 --> 14:15.158
Thank you, Doctor.

14:15.246 --> 14:17.654
Oh, and Miss Ingalls has no clothes.

14:17.749 --> 14:20.833
- So, could she borrow a set of greens?
- No problem.

14:20.919 --> 14:23.374
- Follow me, please.
- I'll join you in a minute.

14:30.678 --> 14:33.679
Okay, who's Maureen Ingalls?

14:35.350 --> 14:37.342
How do you know she isn't?

14:39.354 --> 14:42.023
- My cousin.
- That was a quick fold.

14:42.190 --> 14:44.017
Kate, do you realise
the laws you're violating

14:44.108 --> 14:45.982
by signing her out
when you know she's lying?

14:46.069 --> 14:48.026
Her memory is already
coming back, Gibbs.

14:48.112 --> 14:49.655
I mean, she remembered
the German word

14:49.739 --> 14:51.114
for "explosive fabricator."

14:51.199 --> 14:52.776
- She speaks German?
- No.

14:52.867 --> 14:56.034
No, but I think she makes explosives
for a German firm here.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.694
Or a German terrorist cell
with ties to Al-Qaeda.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.018
Yeah, well, since Al-Qaeda's not listed
in the yellow pages,

15:01.042 --> 15:03.082
let's start tracking
German munition makers first.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.375
Whoa. What's with you and Jane Doe?

15:06.047 --> 15:09.083
She'll be occupying my spare bedroom,
so I don't have to say no to you.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.753
Oh, did I ask, huh? Did I?

15:10.843 --> 15:14.426
- Why are you doing this, Kate?
- She's terrified, Gibbs.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.423
I just think my place
would be more conducive

15:16.516 --> 15:19.089
to her recovering her memory
than a hospital.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.343
And we need to find that bomb.

15:28.736 --> 15:29.981
Gotcha.

15:30.071 --> 15:32.277
I love to hear that word
out of your dark lips, Abby.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.073
Hey, guys. What'd you find?

15:34.158 --> 15:36.946
Kate willing to give her bedroom
to Jane Doe, but not me.

15:37.245 --> 15:38.869
- Shocking.
- Yeah.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.407
- Gotcha.
- You were right, Gibbs.

15:41.499 --> 15:43.907
I matched the magnetic code
to a system made by Magsecure.

15:44.002 --> 15:45.813
- It's a hotel key.
- Got a list of the hotels?

15:45.837 --> 15:47.829
Magsecure's faxing it over.
It'll be here shortly.

15:47.922 --> 15:49.547
Hey, what's that on the top?

15:50.258 --> 15:51.586
A scratch.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.050
That's more than a scratch.

15:57.598 --> 15:59.306
You might actually be right.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.100
- Wanna know what my vision is?
- No.

16:01.185 --> 16:02.763
20/10. Same as Ted Williams.

16:02.854 --> 16:05.142
He could see the seams on a fastball
coming at him.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.606
How about knuckles?

16:08.568 --> 16:09.682
Whoa.

16:13.865 --> 16:16.570
How did someone
etch letters that small?

16:16.951 --> 16:18.445
Micro-laser.

16:18.536 --> 16:21.027
It was developed
to put serial numbers on diamonds.

16:21.122 --> 16:22.766
The numbers are invisible
to the naked eye.

16:22.790 --> 16:23.905
Not mine.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.621
So, the thieves think their heist
is fenceable and then, wham!

16:26.711 --> 16:27.956
They get 5 to 10.

16:28.046 --> 16:29.670
Why use them on a room key?

16:29.756 --> 16:32.163
Maybe somebody was playing
with the hotel's new toy.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.049
Like when photocopiers first came out

16:34.135 --> 16:36.922
and people were copying everything
from C-notes to their butts.

16:37.013 --> 16:39.765
You sat your naked butt
on a photocopier, didn't you, Abby?

16:39.849 --> 16:40.928
Yup.

16:41.476 --> 16:43.468
This is you with the President.

16:43.895 --> 16:47.145
I used to be with the Secret Service
on Air Force One.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.352
Why'd you leave?

16:50.735 --> 16:53.107
The work at NCIS is more interesting.

16:53.196 --> 16:56.066
Than flying around the country
with the President?

16:56.157 --> 16:59.158
Well, it's not all it's cracked up to be.

16:59.494 --> 17:00.988
You know, constantly on edge,

17:01.079 --> 17:03.534
worried that some nut
is gonna take a shot at him.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.165
Or blow him up.

17:06.959 --> 17:10.375
Try this sweater and pants.
They should fit all right.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.000
I've been trying to recall that ship.

17:16.260 --> 17:18.300
I know it's not a carrier.

17:19.097 --> 17:21.884
- Submarine?
- No.

17:23.684 --> 17:26.258
Well, there are no active battleships,

17:26.396 --> 17:29.515
so it would have to be
a cruiser or a destroyer.

17:36.406 --> 17:39.525
- They look the same.
- Not to the Navy.

17:39.617 --> 17:42.155
You know, it's one of them.
I'm sure of it.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.321
Can't you just search them?

17:44.664 --> 17:48.662
Well, these aren't two ships.
They're two classes of ships.

17:48.751 --> 17:52.001
There are 18 destroyers
and seven cruisers in Norfolk alone.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.630
I wish I could give you a name.

17:59.637 --> 18:01.131
Maybe you can.

18:06.644 --> 18:09.265
Looks like there's only three hotels
in the D.C. Area

18:09.355 --> 18:11.146
that use Magsecure keys.

18:11.232 --> 18:13.770
And the phone number
for The Jackson is 555...

18:13.860 --> 18:15.686
5550100.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.772
- Did you get contact lenses?
- Nope.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.406
Can I talk to your manager, please?

18:21.492 --> 18:22.773
- Laser surgery?
- No.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.660
DiNozzo, put a sock in it.

18:25.079 --> 18:27.202
Contact the rest of these hotels.

18:28.249 --> 18:30.574
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.999
Navy Criminal Investigative Service.

18:37.091 --> 18:39.214
Never knew the Navy
had so many ships.

18:39.302 --> 18:41.709
Yeah, and these are just
the cruisers and destroyers.

18:41.804 --> 18:43.927
Some of the names sound familiar.

18:44.432 --> 18:46.259
The cruisers are named after battles,

18:46.350 --> 18:48.888
and the destroyers
are named after naval heroes.

18:49.854 --> 18:52.475
None of them ring a bell, so to speak.

18:53.357 --> 18:54.900
It was worth a shot.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.407
- What's wrong?
- I just feel a little dizzy.

19:03.826 --> 19:05.783
Maybe I should take you back
to the hospital.

19:05.870 --> 19:07.448
No! No.

19:08.456 --> 19:10.413
I think I'm just weak from hunger.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.369
I don't remember the last time I ate.

19:14.378 --> 19:16.454
Well, we'd better
get you some food, then.

19:21.969 --> 19:25.054
I think I have a coat like this.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.596
- You sure?
- The texture

19:30.269 --> 19:31.680
and these buttons.

19:32.188 --> 19:33.848
Yeah. I'm positive.

19:33.981 --> 19:35.096
It's a Michael B.

19:35.191 --> 19:37.183
There's only a few stores
that carry his line.

19:37.276 --> 19:39.684
- Let's go!
- All right, but first we eat.

19:40.321 --> 19:43.192
Food can wait.
Finding the bomb is more important.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.822
You never know
when you get to eat on my job.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.665
None of the hotels
micro-etch their keys.

19:53.751 --> 19:57.202
Well, somebody etched
"the apartment" on that key.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.755
Maybe a permanent resident.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.252
What hotels besides The Jackson
take permanent residents?

20:02.343 --> 20:03.506
Neither of them.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.551
We'll need a search authorisation.

20:06.514 --> 20:09.219
How'd you know The Jackson
had permanent residents?

20:09.308 --> 20:10.423
I just did.

20:10.518 --> 20:12.239
Did you used to live there once,
boss, or...

20:12.311 --> 20:13.556
No.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.680
- You know someone who lives there?
- My ex-wife lives there.

20:20.528 --> 20:23.149
So, you didn't read the phone number.

20:24.031 --> 20:25.276
You knew it.

20:25.866 --> 20:27.444
Anything familiar?

20:27.577 --> 20:30.328
Sound of the traffic outside,
smell of the clothing?

20:30.413 --> 20:31.611
Anything?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.457
It's been awhile, hasn't it?

20:36.544 --> 20:38.335
- You remember me?
- Oh, no.

20:38.421 --> 20:41.338
Your coat, it's about three years old.
Still looks great, though.

20:41.424 --> 20:43.145
You know,
you should check out his new line.

20:43.217 --> 20:44.676
It's really fantastic.

20:45.052 --> 20:47.674
- I prefer black, so...
- Oh, of course.

20:59.150 --> 21:00.941
Do you recognise him?

21:02.111 --> 21:04.898
He reminds me of the man
that attacked me.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.741
Very expensive-looking, boss.

21:07.825 --> 21:09.303
I hope she's not sticking you
with the bill.

21:09.327 --> 21:10.929
Has Mr Richter had a suite here
for a while?

21:10.953 --> 21:12.116
Over two years.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.363
- Then you know him well?
- Oh, not really.

21:14.457 --> 21:16.414
If the residents
don't call us with a problem,

21:16.500 --> 21:17.781
we respect their privacy.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.953
Here we are, suite 8700.

21:20.755 --> 21:21.953
Oh, my.

21:32.391 --> 21:34.799
Gibbs, she just remembered
the man who attacked her.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.017
Okay. She give you a name?

21:37.104 --> 21:39.097
No. He's Caucasian, bald,

21:39.190 --> 21:41.335
late 40s, and when he attacked her,
he was wearing a...

21:41.359 --> 21:45.024
Blue blazer, blue shirt,
burgundy tie with a blue stripe?

21:45.112 --> 21:46.986
- You found him?
- Oh, yeah.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.615
We found him.

21:58.809 --> 22:01.410
Yeah, you're telling me the suits
from Hoover didn't save the man?

22:01.436 --> 22:03.512
Hell, no. It was NCI us.

22:03.605 --> 22:05.125
Yeah, not according to the TV reports.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.898
Yeah, well, when do they get it right?

22:07.067 --> 22:10.068
Boss, this is Detective Andy Kochifis,
homicide.

22:10.153 --> 22:12.360
Cut me some slack
on the Major Kerry investigation.

22:12.447 --> 22:13.728
Yeah, maybe he'll do it again.

22:13.824 --> 22:17.240
- What, I do it once and I'm a whore?
- A courtesan, maybe.

22:18.203 --> 22:19.697
Richter had a year's lease,

22:19.788 --> 22:22.361
but it's not the home address
on his driver's licence.

22:22.916 --> 22:25.870
There's no clothes in the closet,
no photos, just hotel amenities.

22:25.961 --> 22:27.123
Check the booze.

22:29.131 --> 22:30.506
Oh, yeah!

22:30.590 --> 22:33.794
That's not hotel stock.
Macallan 18, Belvedere,

22:33.885 --> 22:35.380
Bombay Sapphire.

22:35.470 --> 22:36.881
Could be a beltway bandit.

22:36.972 --> 22:39.130
Leased this suite
for company entertainment.

22:39.224 --> 22:40.553
In his own name?

22:40.684 --> 22:42.344
Tony said an amnesia case
led you here.

22:42.436 --> 22:45.223
Yeah, found the key to this place
in Jane Doe's grave.

22:45.314 --> 22:46.689
I thought she was alive.

22:46.773 --> 22:50.605
Yeah, she woke up taking a dirt nap
in Rock Creek Park and did a Dracula.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.649
That's a new one.

22:52.738 --> 22:54.944
Whoever buried her thinks she's dead.

22:55.032 --> 22:57.570
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Okay.

22:58.327 --> 23:00.615
But why do you want the lead
on the investigation?

23:00.704 --> 23:02.780
There may be a Navy terrorist attack
in the mix.

23:02.873 --> 23:04.793
We'd just like to keep it all
in one ball of wax.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.576
Yeah, look how well
we did last time, huh?

23:06.668 --> 23:08.354
- Yeah, not according to the...
- To the TV.

23:08.378 --> 23:09.707
Yeah, I know. Don't rub it in.

23:09.796 --> 23:12.916
Yeah, all right, look,
if our ME is cool, so am I.

23:13.008 --> 23:14.799
Ducky, I should do this autopsy.

23:14.885 --> 23:17.173
Now, now, Digger,
I can cite you a dozen cases

23:17.262 --> 23:21.556
where the local authority was usurped
by an ongoing federal investigation.

23:21.641 --> 23:23.266
Look at Lincoln's assassination.

23:23.352 --> 23:26.934
And he was shot at the Ford theatre,
only a few blocks from here.

23:27.022 --> 23:28.979
Now, that is an autopsy I would...

23:32.194 --> 23:34.186
- 79.1.
- 72.3.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.906
My God, Digger.

23:38.116 --> 23:41.734
When did your department
last update its field kits?

23:42.079 --> 23:45.578
Your probe's so old,
it could've been used on Typhoid Mary.

23:45.665 --> 23:48.999
Were you as amazed
by her story as I was, Digger?

23:49.086 --> 23:51.244
A healthy woman
making all those people sick

23:51.338 --> 23:52.797
and not having a clue.

23:52.881 --> 23:55.835
Can you imagine
not having a clue, Digger?

23:56.718 --> 23:58.510
You know, you're right.

23:58.929 --> 24:02.713
Our equipment is outdated.
We're backed up at the lab anyway.

24:04.059 --> 24:06.135
He's all yours, Ducky.

24:07.270 --> 24:09.678
NCIS will handle the autopsy.

24:09.981 --> 24:11.357
Okay, Aldridge.

24:11.858 --> 24:15.358
- What'd he die from, Duck?
- A blunt object to the back of the head.

24:15.445 --> 24:18.482
Yes, I believe we'll find blood and hair.

24:18.573 --> 24:21.527
Well, blood on an object here.

24:21.618 --> 24:25.319
One of the bookends, the obelisk,
crystal ashtray.

24:25.705 --> 24:28.576
I hope he didn't suffer the indignity
of being whacked

24:28.667 --> 24:31.621
by this tawdry bust
of President Kennedy.

24:31.711 --> 24:33.336
- Tony?
- I'm on it.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.550
Was he murdered
before our Jane Doe was buried?

24:36.633 --> 24:39.171
Liver temperature
was close to room temperature.

24:39.261 --> 24:41.549
So, he deceased at least 18 hours ago.

24:41.638 --> 24:43.180
Didn't answer my question.

24:43.265 --> 24:45.222
Jethro, I don't answer
forensic questions

24:45.308 --> 24:46.589
I don't know the answers to.

24:46.685 --> 24:49.390
You know that.
Why do you keep asking me?

24:49.896 --> 24:51.141
Force of habit.

24:51.898 --> 24:54.852
Bad news, Ducky.
Looks like blood on the Kennedy bust.

24:55.902 --> 24:58.061
Oh, you poor man.

25:00.031 --> 25:02.736
What kind of person am I
to be involved in this?

25:03.577 --> 25:07.657
We don't know what the "this" is yet,
or how you're involved.

25:08.415 --> 25:11.084
You know, and bad things
happen to good people all the time.

25:12.085 --> 25:14.576
- I sound like a self-help book.
- No!

25:15.297 --> 25:17.123
You've been wonderful to me.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.625
I deeply appreciate it, Kate.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.168
I just wish I could remember more.

25:25.015 --> 25:27.553
So, the name Walter Richter
means nothing to you?

25:29.478 --> 25:30.640
Nothing.

25:32.731 --> 25:36.064
- Will I have to look at his body?
- Maybe not.

25:36.693 --> 25:38.520
We're running a background check

25:38.612 --> 25:40.604
and we'll find out
how he's connected to you,

25:40.697 --> 25:42.322
if he's connected to you at all.

25:42.407 --> 25:43.688
And here you are.

25:43.783 --> 25:46.701
- I'm starving. How about you?
- Famished.

25:48.121 --> 25:49.450
Thank you.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.000
Tell me what you're seeing.

26:01.801 --> 26:03.675
A sad and lonely woman.

26:10.727 --> 26:12.387
Guys, this is weird.

26:12.479 --> 26:15.266
Ducky didn't like it either.
Said it was tawdry.

26:15.357 --> 26:18.808
Oh, no, no. The bust is cool.
It's what I found that's weird.

26:18.902 --> 26:22.105
There's a partial palm print
on this bust of Kennedy.

26:22.197 --> 26:25.862
And if you remember your history,
there was a partial palm print

26:25.951 --> 26:29.035
on the Mannlicher rifle
used to assassinate Kennedy.

26:30.705 --> 26:33.196
Don't tell me that
you tried to match them?

26:33.291 --> 26:35.782
No, there's not enough
of a print there to match.

26:35.877 --> 26:37.870
But I just thought it would be cool to try.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.880
Are you saying that our palm print
may be useless for identification?

26:40.966 --> 26:43.539
Yes. But don't you think that's weird?

26:43.635 --> 26:45.960
That the Kennedy bust
and the Kennedy murder weapon

26:46.054 --> 26:47.596
both have partial palm prints?

26:47.681 --> 26:49.673
That's not what I think is weird, Ab.

26:49.766 --> 26:51.924
What about the latents
you found at the hotel room?

26:52.018 --> 26:54.723
There were some unknowns
and some matches.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.979
The ones on the crystal tumbler
and the Macallan belong to the victim.

26:58.066 --> 27:01.767
But what's gonna make your day
is the latent you lifted off the desk.

27:01.861 --> 27:03.439
The one on the left side,

27:03.530 --> 27:05.819
Kate took off of Jane Doe
at the hospital.

27:05.907 --> 27:08.742
On the right side
is your print from the desk.

27:08.868 --> 27:11.739
- Well, they match.
- Fourteen Galton points.

27:12.539 --> 27:14.745
Jane Doe was in that hotel suite.

27:15.959 --> 27:18.711
Our victim died
from a subdural haematoma

27:19.296 --> 27:20.790
caused by a skull fracture.

27:20.880 --> 27:24.249
I believe we'll find that
this impression in the parietal lobe

27:24.342 --> 27:28.422
will match that rather gaudy bust
of President Kennedy.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.711
Got a time of death yet?

27:29.806 --> 27:32.760
Well, due to the fixed lividity,
the degree of putrefaction,

27:32.851 --> 27:35.223
the level of Escherichia coli

27:35.312 --> 27:37.767
- in the stomach and digestive tract...
- Ducky.

27:38.273 --> 27:40.431
At least 44 hours ago.

27:40.942 --> 27:43.149
Well, it's the best I can do
with any certainty.

27:43.236 --> 27:45.644
Our Jane Doe was found
at 0350, Monday.

27:45.739 --> 27:46.818
Less than two days ago.

27:46.906 --> 27:49.824
It's safe to say
our guest didn't put her in the ground.

27:50.493 --> 27:53.530
None of this is getting us
to a bomb on a ship, Duck.

27:53.622 --> 27:56.706
But it is, boss. Background on Richter.

27:56.791 --> 28:00.041
He was head of security
for a German firm, BFF.

28:00.795 --> 28:02.871
What is with the Germans
and the alphabet thing?

28:02.964 --> 28:06.499
BMW, BMG, BASF. And they're all B's.

28:06.885 --> 28:09.802
I'm resisting the urge to say,
"Cut the B.S."

28:09.888 --> 28:12.639
BFF stands for
Bombe Fernentdeckung Fabrik.

28:12.724 --> 28:15.808
Tell me that "Bombe" means the same
in German as it does in English.

28:17.646 --> 28:20.682
BFF makes bomb detecting devices
for the U.S. Navy.

28:20.982 --> 28:22.180
Yeah.

28:25.528 --> 28:27.521
- In a hotel?
- The Jackson.

28:30.408 --> 28:31.784
Suite 8700?

28:34.037 --> 28:35.412
I was there Friday.

28:37.165 --> 28:39.122
- To kill Richter?
- No.

28:40.543 --> 28:43.663
- How could you ask such a question?
- It's my job.

28:46.216 --> 28:49.003
I take it you don't have the murderer,
Agent Gibbs.

28:49.094 --> 28:51.170
What were you doing
at The Jackson Friday?

28:51.262 --> 28:52.805
We maintain a suite there.

28:53.014 --> 28:54.974
Two of our senior engineers
were over from Berlin.

28:55.058 --> 28:56.600
We had drinks before dinner.

28:56.685 --> 28:59.057
Why is the room leased
in Richter's name?

28:59.145 --> 29:01.185
Ours is a very competitive business.

29:01.606 --> 29:05.686
We don't want our rivals
knowing where our firm puts up people.

29:06.528 --> 29:08.188
Maids have been bribed.

29:08.988 --> 29:11.658
- Phones bugged.
- People murdered.

29:11.741 --> 29:14.659
- That's a first for us.
- May not be the last.

29:15.203 --> 29:17.361
Who's your explosiver Hersteller?

29:19.040 --> 29:21.496
Suzzanne McNeil. Is she dead, too?

29:22.127 --> 29:23.704
Do you have a photo of her?

29:24.587 --> 29:26.545
Yes, in our personnel records.

29:29.092 --> 29:30.966
What kind of work does she do for you?

29:31.052 --> 29:34.172
She formulates explosives
for our testing needs.

29:35.515 --> 29:39.050
- Please tell me Suzzanne is not dead.
- Suzzanne is not dead.

29:41.688 --> 29:43.680
- Whoops.
- Big whoops.

29:45.024 --> 29:48.725
You look kind of surprised
to find out she's alive, Brauer.

29:49.571 --> 29:50.650
Yeah.

29:50.905 --> 29:53.776
You tell me Walter has been murdered,

29:54.242 --> 29:58.026
you say he may not be the only one,
then you ask me about Suzzanne.

29:58.788 --> 30:01.160
Of course,
I assume that she's dead, too.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.044
This is Suzzanne McNeil.

30:11.968 --> 30:15.337
- Are you sure you're ready to do this?
- I don't know.

30:16.723 --> 30:20.341
But if it can help me regain my memory,
I guess I have no choice, right?

30:21.936 --> 30:23.051
Come on.

30:28.902 --> 30:32.318
Dr Mallard, this is Jane Doe.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.490
- Hello.
- Doctor.

30:48.254 --> 30:49.417
Ready?

30:56.721 --> 31:00.422
There's six months of severance here.
I advise you take it.

31:00.517 --> 31:02.805
Now look for new worlds to conquer.

31:22.455 --> 31:23.700
Anything?

31:24.749 --> 31:25.947
Nothing.

31:28.044 --> 31:30.167
- Poor man.
- Yes.

31:55.354 --> 31:57.264
Her name's Suzzanne McNeil.

31:57.356 --> 32:00.227
She formulates explosives for BFF.

32:00.651 --> 32:04.020
Well, if she put a bomb on a ship,
it could be for a test.

32:04.238 --> 32:07.192
I've e-mailed her personnel file to you.

32:07.283 --> 32:10.699
She's got a top security clearance,
so it'll be like telling her life story.

32:10.787 --> 32:12.411
She didn't recognise Richter?

32:12.538 --> 32:15.373
No. No. All she felt
was sympathy for him.

32:15.458 --> 32:17.996
Got all teary-eyed
over a body she didn't know?

32:18.086 --> 32:19.877
She's a nice lady, Gibbs.

32:19.962 --> 32:21.789
Oh, yeah. So you keep telling me.

32:26.052 --> 32:27.843
Does Brauer know
that she lost her memory?

32:27.929 --> 32:29.043
Maybe.

32:29.388 --> 32:32.342
He knows she's alive
and he's not in cuffs.

32:32.433 --> 32:35.553
Probably thinks she's unconscious
or too traumatised to remember.

32:35.645 --> 32:37.269
Are you sure he buried her?

32:37.396 --> 32:38.725
Oh, yeah.

32:38.815 --> 32:40.688
Why did he want her dead?

32:41.275 --> 32:43.067
I got a couple of ideas.

32:43.277 --> 32:44.558
You wanna share?

32:46.739 --> 32:48.020
I guess not.

32:56.207 --> 32:57.452
Suzzanne.

33:05.133 --> 33:06.413
I'll be with you in a moment.

33:06.509 --> 33:09.759
No, you see,
you told that to Gibbs a half-hour ago.

33:10.012 --> 33:12.800
Look at the expression on his face.
Not good.

33:12.890 --> 33:14.432
Make this one a quickie.

33:18.104 --> 33:19.728
- DiNozzo.
- Sorry, boss.

33:19.814 --> 33:21.814
This guy's Webster's
definition of a micro-manager.

33:21.858 --> 33:23.566
People need his permission
to take a whiz.

33:23.651 --> 33:26.652
I could have gotten coffee.
What'd you pick up? Anything?

33:26.737 --> 33:29.193
Well, give me a few minutes
with this girl, and...

33:32.410 --> 33:33.738
From the little English I heard,

33:33.828 --> 33:36.533
the new Bombe snuffler
isn't snuffling so good.

33:36.622 --> 33:39.742
Brauer's worried it won't pass
Navy acceptance trials Thursday.

33:40.168 --> 33:42.326
Tests? On a Navy ship?

33:42.670 --> 33:44.912
If I heard there were gonna
be tests on a Navy ship,

33:45.006 --> 33:46.832
you think we'd still
be standing here, boss?

33:46.924 --> 33:49.925
Sorry. Forgot your minds
work concurrently.

33:50.636 --> 33:53.886
- Where is this test taking place?
- In some lab here.

33:54.974 --> 33:57.761
I apologise for the delay, Agent Gibbs.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.603
What would you like to see first?

33:59.687 --> 34:02.474
The lab where you're
conducting the Navy tests on Thursday.

34:03.608 --> 34:04.936
Why do you want to go there?

34:05.026 --> 34:06.769
Your chief of security is dead,

34:06.861 --> 34:09.399
and NCIS is tasked
with protecting Navy brass.

34:09.487 --> 34:11.112
You think terrorists killed him?

34:11.199 --> 34:14.864
These days, I look for terrorists
behind most everything.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.860
Of course, yeah. This way, please.

34:21.250 --> 34:24.500
Suzzanne McNeil, this is your life.

34:27.547 --> 34:29.456
- You read it?
- Yes.

34:30.717 --> 34:33.255
Is there anything
I wouldn't wanna know?

34:34.972 --> 34:36.880
The sad and lonely woman?

34:37.391 --> 34:40.096
There's plenty of time
for a husband and kids, Suzzanne.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.389
The good ones are all married.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.690
How well did you know
Suzzanne McNeil?

34:49.570 --> 34:51.063
Didn't she tell you?

34:51.155 --> 34:53.480
I'd like your opinion on the relationship.

34:53.574 --> 34:55.946
Well, I know Suzzanne
quite well professionally.

34:56.034 --> 34:59.155
- She's one of my key employees.
- Kind of sexy, too.

34:59.247 --> 35:02.331
Well, I think you find
all women that way, Agent DiNozzo.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.374
Come on, you gotta admit
she's pretty sexy.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.203
- I'm happily married.
- Yeah?

35:06.295 --> 35:07.920
You have
micro-etching equipment here?

35:08.005 --> 35:11.670
Yeah, Richter uses...
Used it for security purposes.

35:11.759 --> 35:15.460
Did you ever see, this old film,
The Apartment, with Jack Lemmon?

35:15.972 --> 35:18.213
- No, I don't believe so.
- Richter did.

35:18.307 --> 35:21.593
Probably, he loves old movies,
but what does this have to do with...

35:21.686 --> 35:24.011
I assume the photo in your office
is your wife.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.064
Lovely woman.

35:26.983 --> 35:28.892
Older than Suzzanne, of course.

35:29.318 --> 35:32.319
Are you implying that
I had an affair with Miss McNeil?

35:32.405 --> 35:35.655
- Did you?
- No, Agent Gibbs, I did not.

35:35.741 --> 35:38.778
A man in my position
cannot afford to risk losing everything

35:38.869 --> 35:41.242
in one of your ridiculous
sexual harassment suits.

35:41.330 --> 35:42.990
- There is a motive.
- Sure is.

35:43.082 --> 35:45.869
Yeah, I suppose someone in your
profession would look at it that way,

35:45.960 --> 35:48.533
but why would I murder Walter Richter,

35:48.629 --> 35:51.714
who wasn't only a close associate,
but my friend?

35:51.799 --> 35:54.041
- I don't know.
- I wouldn't.

36:03.686 --> 36:05.429
You got a bomb sniffer?

36:06.314 --> 36:07.938
We don't breed dogs.

36:08.024 --> 36:11.274
It's a Fernschaltung
Sprengstoff Spüren Einheitour.

36:11.777 --> 36:14.149
It'll never take first in show
at Westminster.

36:14.280 --> 36:17.234
- Where is that ship?
- In here, Agent Gibbs.

36:23.164 --> 36:25.370
Is this where you use the explosives
Suzzanne makes?

36:26.625 --> 36:29.994
She makes exotic bombs
to test our detecting devices.

36:33.382 --> 36:35.873
You did put a bomb on a Navy ship,

36:35.968 --> 36:38.424
only the ship was a mock-up.

36:38.512 --> 36:40.422
You make bombs for tests.

36:41.474 --> 36:43.680
Didn't I tell you
it was gonna be something like this?

36:43.768 --> 36:45.096
Yes, you did.

36:49.940 --> 36:53.559
But this is like
reading someone else's life.

36:54.320 --> 36:57.190
Not mine.
I mean, I don't remember any of it.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.108
You've gotta give it time, Suzzanne.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.406
How much time do I have, Kate?

37:01.494 --> 37:02.952
I mean, someone tried to kill me.

37:03.037 --> 37:05.575
Someone bashed in
that poor man's head.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.792
Maybe if I go there,
where I work, this BFF,

37:12.880 --> 37:14.374
it'll come back to me.

37:14.924 --> 37:16.764
I think you've been through
enough for one day.

37:16.801 --> 37:18.710
No! Please, Kate!

37:18.803 --> 37:21.091
If I can just sit at my desk

37:21.597 --> 37:24.266
and meet other people, living people,

37:24.517 --> 37:26.640
I just... I think I'll remember.

37:27.478 --> 37:28.676
Please?

37:34.985 --> 37:36.100
What's that?

37:36.195 --> 37:38.022
It's chemical signatures
we are detecting.

37:38.114 --> 37:41.898
Nitrates, mercury,
glycols, cyclotrimethylenes.

37:43.828 --> 37:46.116
Object 4B contains a compound

37:46.205 --> 37:48.874
of cyclonite
and pentaerythrite tetranitrate.

37:48.958 --> 37:50.120
Yeah.

37:50.459 --> 37:52.167
Terrorist-grade semtex.

37:52.253 --> 37:54.541
Our NCIS explosives sniffer
would tag that.

37:54.630 --> 37:56.005
Well, this test is just beginning.

37:56.090 --> 37:57.609
There are more
sophisticated explosives

37:57.633 --> 37:59.791
that your equipment could not detect.

38:03.722 --> 38:06.842
- What makes your sniffer better?
- Our software.

38:06.934 --> 38:09.057
Chemical signatures are compared

38:09.145 --> 38:12.062
to a databank of all known
explosive compounds.

38:12.148 --> 38:15.980
When a critical composition is detected,
it sets off an alarm.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.310
So it's only as good as its software.

38:18.404 --> 38:21.156
Which is very good. Very good.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.779
Then why are you worried
about the Navy trials?

38:24.326 --> 38:28.276
- Is that what Suzzanne said?
- She would be pleased to see us fail.

38:28.372 --> 38:29.487
Why?

38:29.582 --> 38:32.748
She would win, of course,
and Suzzanne likes to win.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.165
It's her job to create explosives
we cannot detect.

38:39.258 --> 38:43.125
So, she held a few surprises back
because she likes to win.

38:44.889 --> 38:47.640
In the beginning,
she had some limited successes.

38:47.725 --> 38:51.425
But Dr Rutger
has rewritten the software to...

38:57.026 --> 38:59.517
I had a hunting dog like that once.

39:03.365 --> 39:06.865
- Hey. Well?
- Reading her file didn't work.

39:06.952 --> 39:09.870
She thought that being up in her office
might help her remember.

39:09.955 --> 39:13.538
- How'd she know where her office was?
- It's called a directory, Tony.

39:13.626 --> 39:16.710
- Are you speaking of Miss McNeil?
- Yeah, we are.

39:17.546 --> 39:20.880
Kate Todd, BFF CEO Stephen Brauer.

39:21.050 --> 39:22.461
- Mr Brauer.
- How are you?

39:22.551 --> 39:24.093
What doesn't she remember?

39:24.637 --> 39:27.009
Well, why don't you ask her yourself?

39:40.778 --> 39:42.569
Suzzanne, stop!

39:42.655 --> 39:45.858
Stop, Suzzanne! Stop, for God's sake!

39:56.669 --> 39:58.412
- Anything?
- No.

39:59.380 --> 40:00.660
Suzzanne?

40:03.759 --> 40:05.337
We know each other?

40:07.346 --> 40:09.255
I'm Stephen. Stephen.

40:10.140 --> 40:13.759
I'm sorry, Mr Stephen.
I don't remember you.

40:13.852 --> 40:16.604
Brauer. Stephen is my given name.

40:17.690 --> 40:20.181
Sorry, Mr Brauer.

40:20.651 --> 40:23.522
Well, that's both good news
and bad news.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.609
She can't tell you
the formula to her explosives,

40:26.699 --> 40:30.150
but, then again, she can't remember
who buried her in Rock Creek Park.

40:30.578 --> 40:32.784
- Were you buried?
- Yes.

40:33.455 --> 40:37.453
- And you don't remember anything?
- Only that I like blueberries.

40:40.588 --> 40:42.130
Come, Suzzanne.

40:42.298 --> 40:44.623
Sit with me. Perhaps, if we talk...

40:46.510 --> 40:47.885
Over here.

40:48.554 --> 40:51.306
That son of a bitch is guilty as hell.

40:56.478 --> 41:01.140
You didn't have the guts to leave her,
but you buried me.

41:05.404 --> 41:08.571
- You don't have amnesia.
- Stephen, you better be careful.

41:08.657 --> 41:11.611
You don't want those agents
to see you scared.

41:13.787 --> 41:15.515
You remember
when I stayed with you that time,

41:15.539 --> 41:18.059
- when it didn't really go so well?
- Yeah, I remember, DiNozzo.

41:18.125 --> 41:21.292
Well, listen, I was younger then.
Immature, a little unfocused.

41:21.378 --> 41:23.287
It was six months ago, Tony.

41:23.422 --> 41:26.838
What happened in the office
was an accident and you know that.

41:27.301 --> 41:29.459
You were out of control.

41:30.262 --> 41:32.800
- I'm not now.
- No.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.802
You're quite calm.

41:36.310 --> 41:37.555
Suzzanne,

41:38.979 --> 41:40.806
we can work this out.

41:42.316 --> 41:43.810
I'll give you anything.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.348
Anything.

41:47.154 --> 41:48.779
A wedding ring?

41:50.824 --> 41:52.283
I'll divorce Brigitte.

41:52.534 --> 41:54.077
The hell you will.

41:54.203 --> 41:55.863
You don't have the guts.

41:57.456 --> 42:00.161
You couldn't even
come to the apartment to dump me.

42:01.085 --> 42:02.662
You sent Walter.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.795
You murdered Walter?

42:06.173 --> 42:09.624
She said, "Someone bashed
the poor man's head in."

42:09.718 --> 42:12.209
How did she know that
Richter's head was bashed in?

42:12.304 --> 42:15.720
I couldn't see his wound.
Nobody told her how he died.

42:18.143 --> 42:19.685
She remembered.

42:19.978 --> 42:22.101
No one dumps me, Stephen.

42:24.274 --> 42:26.314
My latest compound.

42:27.069 --> 42:30.189
So volatile, all you have to do is drop it.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.359
Then you'll die, too.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.278
I've already been buried.

42:38.914 --> 42:40.194
Suzzanne!

42:42.042 --> 42:43.240
Don't!

42:43.836 --> 42:45.246
Sorry, Kate.

42:55.764 --> 42:57.638
- You got some more tape?
- Right here.

42:58.892 --> 43:00.885
We gotta do something, boss.

43:04.356 --> 43:06.847
Have you ever made a mistake, Tony?

43:07.151 --> 43:08.894
According to you or me?

43:09.903 --> 43:11.018
You.

43:11.822 --> 43:12.937
Yeah.

43:13.407 --> 43:15.399
Could anyone make you feel better?

43:18.203 --> 43:19.283
No.

43:24.293 --> 43:26.036
My door's unlocked.

43:26.712 --> 43:27.910
I know.
