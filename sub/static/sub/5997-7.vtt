there's a word for that.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.356
It's called "managing up".

Which, if you want to rise to any

01:07.760 --> 01:09.239
is something
you'd better learn.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.719

"Go out, do the job,

01:14.800 --> 01:16.677
"and don't worry."

01:16.760 --> 01:19.149
But in fact,
what they mean...

01:21.760 --> 01:24.320
Is talk them

Maybe.

Banish me.

I'll go away and never...

34:36.840 --> 34:42.755
From glen to glen

34:42.840 --> 34:48.835
And down the mountain side

34:51.120 --> 34:56.320
The summer's gone

34:56.440 --> 35:03.153
And all the roses falling

35:05.760 --> 35:11.756
It's you, it's you must go

35:12.520 --> 35:15.956
And I must bide

35:21.880 --> 35:26.431
But come ye back

35:26.560 --> 35:33.159

35:35.760 --> 35:41.472

35:41.560 --> 35:48.079

35:50.360 --> 35:55.753

36:20.080 --> 36:22.754
Says he knows Dodd,
where he is.

36:25.920 --> 36:27.354
What did you say?

36:27.480 --> 36:28.879
I told him you were out.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.550
Argh!

36:30.640 --> 36:33.029
Did the men hear?
They know?

36:33.600 --> 36:34.635
No.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.553
Shit, man. I don't say
nothing unless you tell me.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.958
There's no Dodd,
you hear? Not anymore.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.519

38:33.720 --> 38:35.358
Molly likes her,

38:35.800 --> 38:38.918
and she's helping.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.469
And you? You feel okay?

38:42.560 --> 38:45.837
Better than some.
Worse than others.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.319
Well, can you rest?

38:48.120 --> 38:51.750
How am I supposed to rest? You
keep telling me how bad things are.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.753
Ask Karl about
John McCain's thumbscrews.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.592
What?

38:59.680 --> 39:01.478
He said to tell you

39:01.560 --> 39:03.358
that if John
McCain could survive

39:03.480 --> 39:05.198
five years in Viet
Cong thumbscrews,

39:05.320 --> 39:07.231
you could beat cancer.

about that... My daughter?

39:12.040 --> 39:14.759
But I'm trying.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.589

Come home soon.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.394

I will.

Well, looks like
Floyd's gonna flip.

40:00.720 --> 40:02.472
Yeah?
Yeah, took some doing,

40:02.560 --> 40:03.709
but we convinced her

40:03.800 --> 40:07.111
the only way this thing was
gonna end up in the win column,

40:07.200 --> 40:09.840
was if she puts
us in the game.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.270
Hmm.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.313
Okay, first, I want...

40:18.080 --> 40:21.391
I want it on the record that
this is a road of last resort.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.119
My husband...

40:25.880 --> 40:27.075
Second,

40:27.160 --> 40:29.800
I need assurances that
none of my children,

40:29.880 --> 40:32.440
or my grandchildren are in
line for any repercussions.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.510
This is my choice.

40:33.880 --> 40:37.191
My war. They're just
doing what they're told.

supposed to mean?

40:43.400 --> 40:45.311
Murder in the first
and the like.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.794
What's the point of the damn
deal if it doesn't cover murder?

40:48.880 --> 40:51.076
From this point forth,
he's saying.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.474
New crimes.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.318
Now, time you tell
us what you know.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.190
Don't you look at
me with those eyes.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.636
My information is they hide it
in the tires.

41:31.520 --> 41:35.400
Here in town, they store their
gak in two different places.

41:35.480 --> 41:38.313
There's a nail
salon on Robertson.

41:38.400 --> 41:41.472
And an auto
repair shop on First.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.240
And check the air pump inside.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.072

And find Dodd.

Don't care how.

I think we just
chose a side.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.834
Indian shot two
troopers in South Dakota.

44:06.920 --> 44:08.319
What? What Indian?

44:08.400 --> 44:09.356
Ours.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.717
Description matches the
Gerhardt's man, been missing.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.517
Where?
Sioux Falls.

44:16.240 --> 44:19.119
Witness said the
Indian shot up a bar

44:19.200 --> 44:21.271
and that he was looking
for a young couple.

44:21.640 --> 44:22.789

being a redhead.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.069
Peggy and Ed.

It's South Dakota's problem,
it sounds like.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.473
HANK: That's one way
to think about it.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.637
So, the Indian,
probably he got away, yeah?

44:30.920 --> 44:31.990
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.391
One trooper dead,
one clinging to life.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.876
Still, pursuit means
they could be close.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.236
Right? Peggy and Ed?
Holed up somewhere.

44:42.320 --> 44:43.355
Or on the road.

44:43.440 --> 44:46.193
If we're lucky, yeah. The
troopers got road blocks set up.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.194
Then there's Dodd.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.476
Usually where the
Indian goes, Dodd's there.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.880
Witness just saw the Indian.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.276
Except remember,

44:54.360 --> 44:56.954
we just promised to give
the Gerhardts a free pass.

44:58.800 --> 45:01.599
You better run it by the
captain. That's all I'm saying.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.000
You're a shit cop.
You know that, right?

marry my sister, you know.

marry that boy someday."

46:19.920 --> 46:22.719
But then there was Vietnam
and he joined up,

46:23.720 --> 46:26.758
and she never was very
good at waiting. So he got me.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.799
The dud.

man and wife,"

over him and her any day.

looking after too, before too long.

get married again, it's okay.

close together or something.

I'll fix your feet
till you can't walk

53:34.600 --> 53:39.356
I'll lock your jaw
till you can't talk

53:41.600 --> 53:45.514
I'll close your eyes
SO you can't see

53:45.600 --> 53:50.117
This very hour,
come and go with me

53:53.280 --> 53:56.398
I am death
I come to take the soul

53:56.480 --> 54:00.997
Leave the body
and leave it cold

54:02.840 --> 54:05.309
Where's this eggplant who
can't stop shitting the bed?

54:08.680 --> 54:09.670
Gentlemen.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.917
(MAN EXCLAIMING)

54:18.240 --> 54:20.277
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

54:32.440 --> 54:34.238
Bag them and drop
them in the woods.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.638
We tell the boss
the Gerhardts got them.

54:41.160 --> 54:43.197
(RINGING)

55:12.760 --> 55:13.875
Hello?

55:14.080 --> 55:15.150
ED: Mike Milligan?

55:20.320 --> 55:21.390
Yes.

55:22.280 --> 55:23.839
Today's your lucky day.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.638
I've got Dodd Gerhardt in the
trunk of my car. You want him?

55:28.760 --> 55:30.751
(JUST DROPPED IN PLAYING)

55:54.640 --> 55:56.631
(SINGING)
I woke up this morning

55:56.760 --> 55:59.832
With the sundown shinin'in

56:02.600 --> 56:04.273
I found my mind

56:04.400 --> 56:07.552
In a brown paper bag within

56:10.560 --> 56:14.235
I tripped on a cloud
and fell eight miles high

56:14.480 --> 56:18.394
I tore my mind
on a jagged sky

56:18.520 --> 56:21.034
I just dropped in to see

56:21.120 --> 56:24.431
What condition my
condition was in

56:36.520 --> 56:39.990
I pushed my soul
in a deep dark hole

56:40.240 --> 56:42.038
And I followed it in

56:44.240 --> 56:47.631
I watched myself crawlin' out

56:47.720 --> 56:51.350
As I was a-crawlin'in

56:52.080 --> 56:55.960
I got up so tight
I couldn't unwind

56:56.040 --> 56:59.795
I saw so much
I broke my mind

57:00.040 --> 57:02.714
I just dropped in to see

57:02.800 --> 57:05.918
What condition my
condition was in
