01:29.923 --> 01:31.334
Hey, Olivia.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.102
Olivia. Um...

01:35.596 --> 01:36.666
Olivia?

01:37.564 --> 01:38.565
Oh!

01:38.999 --> 01:41.275
Hey, didn't you hear the bell?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.173
I'm testing the sound
on the FlowerCam Mark 3.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.339
Oh, wow!

01:45.505 --> 01:47.849
It's really coming along.

01:48.075 --> 01:50.077
And cute too.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.415
Give it a try.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.789
Testing, testing.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.827
Hello.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.356
Argh, I don't believe it.

02:02.522 --> 02:05.696
Tanya's got me detentioned
for running in the hall.

02:07.027 --> 02:10.031
But school's out,
everyone's running. Argh!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.868
Hmm. Hmm...

02:25.112 --> 02:28.992
Looks like the dogs
took you for a good walk, Mia.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.126
They're a handful, all right.

02:34.855 --> 02:38.302
Kool Klip alert.
Everyone stay calm.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.698
Guys, guys, guys-

02:40.861 --> 02:43.000
Guess who's coming to Heartlake City.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.076
It's... It's...

02:46.233 --> 02:47.576
Livi.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.236
So gorgeous.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.405
- So fashionable.
- So famous.

02:51.571 --> 02:55.519
Wait. Wouldn't it be great
if she heard one of our songs?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.246
Like that's gonna happen.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.085
Hey, let's record our new song now.

03:00.247 --> 03:02.318
I've been playing with the lyrics.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.596
<i>♪ Bring on the lights,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.395

03:20.901 --> 03:23.939
<i>♪ Let's live it up ♪</i>

03:25.105 --> 03:27.210

03:46.359 --> 03:47.633
We got it.

03:47.794 --> 03:50.798
- Oh, the verdict?
- We nailed it.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.276
Great lyrics, Andrea.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.470
Thanks.

03:56.636 --> 04:00.277
Just think. This is our chance
to get our big break.

04:00.474 --> 04:04.650
I think a crazy plan is coming our way.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.916
If we can just get the song to Livi,

04:07.080 --> 04:10.994
she'll help launch my career.
I'll be rich and famous.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.826
And what happened to "us"?
We're a band, remember?

04:15.055 --> 04:17.558
Yeah, what good is fame
if you don't have your friends?

04:17.724 --> 04:20.671
That's just it. We'll all be famous.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.965
As if.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.008
What do you want?

04:26.166 --> 04:29.238
Me'? Oh, nothing.

04:29.469 --> 04:33.849
It's just so much fun listening
to you guys think you could be pop stars.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.009
We've got a better chance than you.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.123
Oh, please. If anyone's going to make it
in this town,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.953
it's going to be me
and my band The Teardrops.

04:42.315 --> 04:45.626
Livi is recording
in my sister Megan's studio,

04:45.786 --> 04:49.757
so she's hooking me up
with some sweet backstage passes.

04:49.990 --> 04:54.598
Gotta go, amigos,
don't want to be late for the rehearsal.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.001
See ya.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.604
I'm sick of Tanya throwing shade on us.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.814
I gotta go. I'm late for the hotel.
Come on, buddies.

05:06.339 --> 05:07.511
Oh.

05:07.707 --> 05:11.052
Mia, hang on a second.
Let me get this straight.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.158
- You're going to Heartlake Hotel?
- Yeah.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.158
Because you're the official dog walker?

05:17.317 --> 05:21.060
So you've got access
to where Livi is staying?

05:21.221 --> 05:22.393
I guess.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.627
Olivia, memory-stick me.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.837
Voilà. The key to our success.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.806
But Tanya said that
Livi's going to Heartlake Studio.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.309
Even better. Give it to her there.

05:35.468 --> 05:38.711
This is it. Stardom awaits.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.651
Argh, slow down.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.857
<i>No, I could have done, he said...</i>

05:51.051 --> 05:52.052
Excuse me.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.561
Yes, I'll be sure to pass that on.
Thank you.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.195
Deliveries are around the back.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.262
Actually, I'm here to see Livi.

06:02.596 --> 06:06.169
I'm sorry. I thought
you just said you were here to see Livi.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.542
- I did.
- Oh, well in that case, go right through.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.273
Gee, thanks.

06:11.605 --> 06:15.280
Yeah, exsqueeze me.
Livi is the biggest star on the planet,

06:15.442 --> 06:17.444
she doesn't just talk to anyone.

06:17.677 --> 06:21.352
But I have something really important
to give her.

06:21.514 --> 06:22.788
I'll only be a minute.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.594
You'll need to speak to Megan.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.971
Uh, uh...

06:39.132 --> 06:43.239
Livi, how's my superstar?
You look fabulous.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.041
<i>Megan, you can't see me.</i>

06:45.205 --> 06:47.811
I... I don't need to, darling,
you always look fabulous.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.818
<i>Well, I don't right now,
how's the new song coming along?</i>

06:51.044 --> 06:54.321
Oh, it's fantastic, a guaranteed hit.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.757
<i>Great, I'll be at the studio
in 10 minutes.</i>

06:56.917 --> 06:58.055
<i>Can't wait to hear it.</i>

06:58.218 --> 07:01.927
Um, yeah, me too. Ciao.

07:03.723 --> 07:06.397
Wow, this new song sounds special.

07:06.559 --> 07:09.631
It better be. Otherwise, we're in for it.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.503
What'?

07:19.172 --> 07:22.016
Hello, I'm Megan, the studio manager.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.084
Hi. I'm Mia.

07:24.244 --> 07:27.282
I brought this demo
for Livi to listen to, and I hope that...

07:27.447 --> 07:28.687
A demo?

07:29.249 --> 07:31.593
Don't worry, I'll deal with this.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.129
Err... Shoo, shoo.

07:34.521 --> 07:35.966
Go on, get...

07:36.957 --> 07:39.267
I'm in a band, you see.
And we've got this song.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.032
And our lead singer, Andrea,
she's really great.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.665
And she thinks we could be
super mega pop stars just like Livi.

07:45.832 --> 07:49.473
But only if Livi hears our song,
and then she can help us.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.637
Hmm...

07:50.870 --> 07:53.714
Interesting. Well, thank you, Mary.

07:53.974 --> 07:54.975
Mia.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.721
Quite. I couldn't possibly
take it from you, sweetie.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.359
But, uh, Megan?

08:01.614 --> 08:02.615
Hmm...

08:03.016 --> 08:05.860
I like your spirit, Mary.
Let me see what I can do.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.895
Oh, you'll take the song to Livi?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.796
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Livi's a very busy woman.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.329
- Hmm!
- Hmm.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.503
Tanya, let's get going.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.313
No dogs allowed. De-de-de-de...

08:35.414 --> 08:38.259
Heads up, people. Wheres the song
you've been working on?

08:38.418 --> 08:42.832
Show me what you got.
I want nothing less than amazing.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.094
Yeah, hit us with the beats.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.398
- Tanya.
- Yeah?

08:47.560 --> 08:50.769
Be a dear and
grab me a double skinny vanilla milkshake.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.500
Oh, right.

08:52.732 --> 08:53.836
And don't forget.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.671
With sprinkles on top.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.949
Love sprinkles on top.

09:07.847 --> 09:08.951
Stop!

09:10.350 --> 09:13.297
Are you deliberately trying
to sabotage me?

09:13.753 --> 09:15.630
You know what's amazing about you people?

09:16.456 --> 09:20.427
Nothing. You wouldn't know "amazing“
if it sat up in your soup."

09:20.593 --> 09:26.236
This is garbage.
In fact, that's where garbage belongs.

09:26.766 --> 09:30.578
Now write me an amazing hit song,
or start looking for a new job.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.617
Because that's what I'll be doing,
if you don't come up with a hit for...

09:37.544 --> 09:39.649
Livi, darling.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.784
Oh, my little sweetie. Oh, little Cookie,
all cooped up inside here.

09:44.951 --> 09:46.624
We need to get you outside for a walk.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.060
Yes, we do.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.667
Looking fabulous as always, Livi.

09:50.957 --> 09:53.062
Spare me the soft soap, Megan.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.906
Let's hear that new song
you told me about.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.406
Well, um, you see...

09:57.564 --> 09:58.565
Yes?

09:58.731 --> 10:00.677
Um... Here it is.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.400

10:27.527 --> 10:30.201
This is fabulous. I love it.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.038
Oh, Cookie shake. Oh, he loves it too.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.842
And Cookie's never wrong. It's a hit.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.451
You guys are amazing.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.286
Amazing, yes.

10:43.510 --> 10:45.888
I was just saying, the minute I wrote it,

10:46.112 --> 10:49.355
I knew it was the song for you.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.119
Well done, Megan.

10:51.284 --> 10:55.232
Come on, Cookie, let's find someone
who can take you for a walk.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.489
Love the layers...

11:12.071 --> 11:15.917
Tanya, can you believe it?
Livi loves the song I wrote for her.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.418
We're now officially

11:17.577 --> 11:19.818
"amazing..."

11:19.979 --> 11:21.014
Where have you been'?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.388
An ice-cold milkshake for you.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.759
Forget the drinks.
I've got just the task for you.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.423
If you do it well,
you can record your own song,

11:29.589 --> 11:33.162
become rich and famous
and make a gazillion new friends.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.396
How does that sound?

11:36.729 --> 11:39.209
I'm all ears.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.018
Uh...

11:53.079 --> 11:55.855
- Oh.
- That was, um, original.

11:56.015 --> 12:00.760
<i>Thanks. It's</i> called
<i>Funky Sitar Groove To The Max. Oh, Yeah.</i>

12:01.354 --> 12:02.628
Uh...

12:02.855 --> 12:04.801
I might change the title.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.631
You should totally record it.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.932
No, it's not there yet.

12:09.362 --> 12:10.864
Still needs some tweaks.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.977
Not from what I've just heard.
Let's do it.

12:14.934 --> 12:20.316
Olivia does all the recording.
I don't know how to work the equipment.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.645
It's easy. All you do is press "Record,"

12:23.810 --> 12:25.153
this button right here.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.382
I guess. It'll be fun.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.627
We need to capture the moment.

12:29.782 --> 12:33.628
<i>The</i> world <i>needs to hear
Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.</i>

12:33.786 --> 12:36.960
<i>Funky Sitar Groove To The Max. Oh, Yeah.</i>

12:37.123 --> 12:38.158
Exactly.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.662
Okay.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.637
Here goes.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.620
Oh.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.260
Out of sight.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.590
Really? Let's play it back.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.698
Uh...

13:09.856 --> 13:10.857
There's no need.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.833
I could jam some more.

13:12.992 --> 13:16.269
Sounds great but I gotta slide. Bye.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.969
Tanya, what are you doing here?

13:22.201 --> 13:25.375
Um, just picking up
the vibes in this room,

13:25.538 --> 13:27.540
you guys are so wonderfully talented

13:27.707 --> 13:28.708
and original.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.322
I was just hoping some of the magic
would rub off on me.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.547
See ya.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.555
- Argh, double horror.
- Ah! My ears are burning.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.159
Oh. Hey guys, what's up?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.560
Look whose dog I've got.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.466
Does this mean Livi has our song?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.664
Yeah, mission accomplished.

13:49.962 --> 13:53.409
"O" to the "M" to the "G". You did it.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.409
I'm going to be famous.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.546
We're going to be famous.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.513
Hey, that's my line.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.523
Ah! Girls, check it out.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.751
I told Heartlake Studio we're doing
a story on Livi for Star Moment Magazine

14:09.916 --> 14:12.590
and they've invited us
to Livi's press conference.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.993
Ooh! And do you think
Livi's listened to our song yet?

14:16.189 --> 14:19.068
How could she not? And I bet she loves it.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.205
It's going to be bigger than

Thank you again
for such a warm welcome to Heartlake City.

15:37.303 --> 15:42.013
As a special treat, I'd like to play
a few bars of something brand new.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.459
I'm going to debut
my next hit single Girlz

16:23.616 --> 16:25.687
<i>at my concert this Saturday night.</i>

16:25.852 --> 16:28.355
Did she just say "her" hit single?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.398
I guess this means she liked it.

16:30.556 --> 16:34.561
Yeah, she liked my song so much,
she stole it.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.468
Livi jacked my song.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.905
Andrea, we wrote that song together.

16:39.065 --> 16:42.376
Yeah, Stephanie,
and it's turned into a total nightmare.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.741
Not for Livi.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.382
We'll see about that.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.713
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.355
Livi. Livi.
Did you write the song yourself?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.432
Livi,
anything special for Christmas?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.719
<i>Who's your best friend?</i>

16:55.882 --> 16:59.261
Livi, tell the truth,
did you personally write that song?

16:59.418 --> 17:03.389
Well, sometimes'
the words come fully formed,

17:03.556 --> 17:06.036
like they were destined only for me.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.262
But that's our song. We wrote it.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.203
 Is it hard,
always being the center of attention?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.208
Cookie, calm down, it's okay.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.348
Oh, poor Cookie's getting agitated.

17:26.378 --> 17:29.553
Argh, Livi is a super mega pop liar.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.594
Stand back. Let a pro handle this.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.558
Attention, please.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.064
Attention, please!

17:44.230 --> 17:45.573
Thank you.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.300
Thank you.

17:47.466 --> 17:51.915
Just so everyone knows,
that's my song Livi just played.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.875
Hey-

18:04.383 --> 18:05.953
I don't care what you say.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.961
I'm going back inside.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.837
If anyone says, "That went well,".

18:14.994 --> 18:18.498
<i>I'll</i> personally delete
all their social media.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.175
Well, there are worse things.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.409
What could possibly be worse?

18:23.569 --> 18:25.571
It could be raining.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.985
Maybe Livi didn't mean to take the song?

18:32.144 --> 18:33.817
Oh, yeah, it was an accident.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.517
Mia, who did you give the song to?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.184
Oh, Megan.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.794
And Tanya.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.694
Tanya, there are people
running towards me.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.965
Hey. What's Livi's game'?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.971
Quit giving me the stink eye, Tanya,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.337
tell your sister
there's been a terrible mix up.

18:53.499 --> 18:55.501
That's our song, not Livi's.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.376
Oh, yes. Your song.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.710
<i>Funky Sitar Groove To The Max.</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:02.145
<i>Oh, Yeah.</i>

19:02.308 --> 19:03.719
Huh?

19:04.010 --> 19:07.184
Why would anyone want to steal that?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.052
Tanya, you can't just walk away. Tanya!

19:11.217 --> 19:12.389
- Tanya, wait. Don't go.
- Tanya, wait.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.224
- Tanya, don't go.
- Tanya!

19:20.893 --> 19:22.236
What now?

19:23.029 --> 19:25.009
We're going to get our song back!

19:34.707 --> 19:36.653
I don't understand.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.586
I saved our master recording to the cloud,
and now it's gone!

19:40.746 --> 19:42.089
All that's left is...

19:47.420 --> 19:49.263
I think Tanya tricked me.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.765
You taped over my song'?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.195
Our song.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.768
It was an accident.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.064
An accident?

19:55.227 --> 19:56.934
Oh, that's all right then.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.004
What were you thinking? Argh!

20:01.333 --> 20:02.937
Hey, Emma didn't mean it.

20:03.235 --> 20:06.114
You heard her, Tanya tricked her.

20:06.439 --> 20:09.579
Speaking of Tanya.
Why did you give the song to her?

20:09.909 --> 20:12.082
I didn't. I gave it to Megan.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.551
Tanya's sister! Argh!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.190
I don't know which is worse,

20:16.348 --> 20:19.352
Tanya getting the song
or Livi saying it's hers.

20:19.685 --> 20:23.030
I'll speak to them.
I'm sure they can explain everything.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.203
Mia, you're giving me a headache.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.305
I'm sure it's just
one big misunderstanding.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.807
No more misunderstandings.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.536
It's time for action.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.803
Well, we could write another song.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.917
No, I told you.
We're going to get our song back.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.074
But how'?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.811
We need a plan.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.987
Ha! I had a plan!

20:46.145 --> 20:48.147
Oh, you did? Care to share?

20:48.547 --> 20:50.823
Yeah, record a bazillion hit songs,

20:50.983 --> 20:52.826
become a super mega pop star,

20:52.985 --> 20:55.659
and have a fantastic luxurious life!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.895
Hmm, I know what we should do.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.059
A heist!

21:00.226 --> 21:03.503
We break into Livi's hotel room
and get our song back.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.504
I'm not sure stealing is a good idea.

21:06.665 --> 21:09.509
It's not stealing.
It's liberating whats ours.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.172
A heist.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.146
You know, I like it.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.409
I love it!

21:14.573 --> 21:17.349
- I knew I'd come up with something.
- Hmm.

21:17.510 --> 21:21.117
I mean, we.
I knew we'd come up with something.

21:25.251 --> 21:29.256
I don't know, Mia. Was it really necessary
to walk the dogs right now'?

21:29.522 --> 21:32.935
Hey, when these little guys want to
go walkies, they want to go walkies.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.935
Oh, but don't let us stop you guys.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.596
<i>Go ahead, plan away.</i>

21:37.530 --> 21:40.272
Okay, the heist,
here's how it's going to work.

21:40.499 --> 21:42.479
Shh, don't say another word.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.709
Huh, why not'?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.881
Because here come the three T's.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.809
Tanya, The Teardrops and Trouble.

21:51.544 --> 21:55.185
Well, if it isn't
Andrea and the Anchovies.

21:55.381 --> 21:57.224
That is not our name.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.553
I like it.

21:58.717 --> 22:00.196
The first half of it, anyway.

22:00.686 --> 22:04.566
Hi Emma, how's your epic song doing,
what was it called again?

22:04.723 --> 22:08.830
<i>Oh,</i> I <i>know, Freaky Guitar Moves
To The Minimum. Oh, No!</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:12.837
Actually Tanya, it's called
<i>Funky</i> Sitar Groove To The Max.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.237
Oh, yeah.

22:14.400 --> 22:18.246
How could I forget, I mean
with a hit like that on your hands,

22:18.537 --> 22:21.484
you practically got me and the girls here
shaking in our shoes.

22:22.808 --> 22:25.516
Come on, girls, let's go record
some proper music.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.986
Oh, yeah!

22:30.249 --> 22:31.751
Well, one thing is for sure,

22:31.917 --> 22:35.330
Tanya is definitely
a really annoying girl, to the max!

22:35.754 --> 22:40.225
Forget about her, let's get back
to the plan, the heist, Olivia.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.869
Okay, to start with,
we'll need some diversions,

22:43.028 --> 22:46.339
and plans of the hotel so we can arrange
the break-in and escape routes.

22:46.732 --> 22:50.441
Hmm... Mia!
You're our insider at the hotel.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.207
Grab any intel you can.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.373
We'll stay here
and sort out everything else.

22:54.573 --> 22:58.885
Uh, well' I do have to go back
to the hotel to drop the dogs off.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.022
Perfect, go, go, go!

23:02.214 --> 23:03.955
Okay, so let's figure this out.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.600
<i>Livi! Love you!</i>

23:19.298 --> 23:23.474
Uh, excuse me, do you know
where head office is'?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.709
The hand says it's break time.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.318
But this is urgent.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.378
A matter of the utmost urgency.

23:32.978 --> 23:36.323
If I tell you where
you need to go, will you go?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.391
It'll be like I was never here.

23:38.717 --> 23:42.392
Down that corridor.
But watch out for Miss Eisenberg!

23:42.788 --> 23:45.997
Uh, Miss Eisenberg.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.230
Keep this area clean.
I've seen you with your dogs.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.336
Um, they're the guests' dogs.

23:51.497 --> 23:54.171
I don't care.
I want everything spic and span.

23:54.333 --> 23:57.507
We're on special lockdown for Livi.
Comprende?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.913
Yes, sir, Miss Eisenberg, sir.
Spic and span!

24:01.073 --> 24:03.314
It's Ms. Eisenberg.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.852
And I'm watching you.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.345
Come on, guys.

24:06.512 --> 24:09.118
Your royal Livi-ness.

24:10.182 --> 24:13.322
Let's make this quick, people.
Argh, I don't have all day.

24:13.485 --> 24:17.126
These are just fabulicious,
don't you just love the back, Livi?

24:17.356 --> 24:19.632
They're fine, I suppose.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.703
Okay, next up, Livi,
you've got a face peel.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.362
A boot camp power workout.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.973
Four TV interviews
with Channels 5 through 8.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.974
- A mud bath.
- Extreme body burn.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.137
And a phone conference with the Chinese,
from China.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.044
The whole of China?

24:33.872 --> 24:36.284
Yes, but aren't the hoodies divine?

24:36.475 --> 24:40.890
Livi'? Livi? Livi?

24:41.213 --> 24:42.253
We'll also need a dye job.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.541
<i>- Nail color.
- Squat session.</i>

24:43.682 --> 24:44.956
<i>Package pick-up from Bangkok.</i>

24:45.117 --> 24:46.152
Straight hair with curly teeth.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.319
Super cardio circuit.

24:47.519 --> 24:48.959
<i>Leopard with electric blue.</i>

24:48.988 --> 24:50.990
Oh, one day, Cookie,

24:51.156 --> 24:54.729
we'll be out there with them
without a care in the world.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.403
Stop! Enough, already.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.838
I'm going to powder my nose.

25:07.306 --> 25:08.410
By myself!

25:19.385 --> 25:20.386
Hmm.

25:22.421 --> 25:23.593
Hmm.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.439
Oh, Cookie, isn't this magnificent?

25:34.867 --> 25:37.177
The sight of glorious sunshine.

25:37.336 --> 25:40.681
The smell of freshly out grass
and the sound of...

25:40.839 --> 25:42.614
- Hey, Livi. Livi!
- Oh!

25:43.342 --> 25:44.377
Fans!

25:49.782 --> 25:51.523
We better go and sign some autographs.

25:56.188 --> 25:59.431
Love you! Love you!

25:59.892 --> 26:03.101
I love you, you and you.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.705
Whoa! Watch out!

26:10.969 --> 26:15.145
Oh, wow, I am <i>so</i> sorry...
It's you!

26:15.707 --> 26:19.086
Okay. One autograph
but then you'll have to leave.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.157
You!
Aw, it's so good to see you.

26:22.314 --> 26:26.126
Oh, that's right, who's a good boy,
who's a good boy?

26:26.318 --> 26:29.231
Hold on. I remember you.

26:29.388 --> 26:32.096
From the press conference.
You looked out for Cookie.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.498
Yeah. He was getting a bit stressed out.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.641
Well, than ks.
We appreciate it, don't we, Cookie?

26:38.263 --> 26:41.733
No problem. I love dogs.
All animals, really.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.780
Yeah, they don't care who you are
or what you do.

26:46.004 --> 26:49.577
Yeah, they're like,
"I love you just 'cause you're you!"

26:51.510 --> 26:53.820
I wish humans were like that, too.

26:55.747 --> 27:00.025
I guess ii must be kind of hard
being an amazing pop star, huh?

27:00.185 --> 27:04.133
Well, just once it'd be nice
not to talk about being a celebrity,

27:04.289 --> 27:07.634
or my fashionable wardrobe,
or the world tours.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.204
Or your next smash hit.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.867
Exactly. I'd love to talk about
just normal stuff, you know?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.876
And, about your new song.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.379
Oh, man, not you <i>as</i> well.

27:19.538 --> 27:23.384
No, no, no... I mean...
Forget your new song.

27:23.709 --> 27:26.212
Would you like to just
hang out for a while?

27:26.945 --> 27:29.050
Me? Hang out with you?

27:29.214 --> 27:31.717
Just a couple of normal people
hanging out.

27:32.117 --> 27:33.152
Nice idea.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.389
Trouble is, I can't go out in public.

27:35.554 --> 27:38.694
I'll get mobbed.
I can't even go for an ice cream.

27:39.057 --> 27:43.563
My personal trainer won't allow it
and security would go ballistic.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.405
Wow, it's like you're trapped.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.305
Tell me about it.

27:55.741 --> 27:56.811
Still on your break?

27:57.576 --> 27:58.577
No.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.812
I'm clocking out. Here you go.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.686
Wait, what?

28:02.848 --> 28:04.759
The hand is done for the day.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.269
Hey, these are kind of ﬂy.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.368
They're okay, I guess.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.838
I've got an idea.

28:19.498 --> 28:20.499
Huh?

28:31.276 --> 28:33.187
Shh.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.956
Livi?

28:43.288 --> 28:44.460
Where are you going'?

28:44.623 --> 28:49.038
Pinch me. I'm dreaming. It's, it's, Livi!

28:49.561 --> 28:53.566
Livi! Livi! Livi!

28:53.966 --> 28:54.967
I love you!

28:56.568 --> 28:58.878
We love you! Livi!

29:01.406 --> 29:04.979
Livi merchandise. Straight from Livi.
I'm never washing again.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.215
Livi! Run! Yeah!

29:08.380 --> 29:09.552
Quick! Save her!

29:20.325 --> 29:21.827
There she is!

29:29.501 --> 29:33.847
Livi, darling, you simply
cannot run off like that.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.013
Huh? Hey! You're not Livi!

29:38.176 --> 29:39.484
You don't say.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.851
Isn't that Livi over there?

29:42.347 --> 29:44.156
Hmm?

29:46.151 --> 29:47.994
Argh!

29:50.522 --> 29:51.967
Hey, watch the threads!

29:52.758 --> 29:54.760
Try them all, we've got to find her!

29:57.095 --> 29:58.096
Argh!

30:08.607 --> 30:10.553
Cookie!

30:12.511 --> 30:14.047
It worked!

30:14.279 --> 30:16.020
Then what are we waiting for?

30:16.715 --> 30:17.955
Yeah.

30:19.951 --> 30:21.953
Hey, wait for me.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.400
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
♪ I know who you are, yeah ♪</i>

30:29.561 --> 30:33.202
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
♪ Not just a girl with her guitar, yeah ♪</i>

30:33.365 --> 30:37.074
<i>- ♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
- ♪ It's really complicated ♪</i>

30:37.235 --> 30:40.876
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey ♪
♪ You smile but you're frustrated ♪</i>

30:43.675 --> 30:44.676
Argh!

30:45.143 --> 30:49.649
That's the third time, Zoey.
That's anything but "amazing".

30:49.915 --> 30:53.055
I know, Tanya, but I am trying my best.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.587
Your best'?

30:54.753 --> 30:57.495
And you suppose I'm satisfied with that'!

30:57.923 --> 30:59.425
Yeah, Tanya, our best.

30:59.591 --> 31:01.502
You're being incredibly pushy today.

31:01.760 --> 31:06.106
Well, it's not every day Megan
gives someone a shot at fame.

31:06.264 --> 31:10.940
What she did for Livi
she can do for Tanya and the Teardrops.

31:11.103 --> 31:14.277
Yeah, Tanya, but at what cost
to The Teardrops?

31:14.439 --> 31:15.577
Or her friendship?

31:15.741 --> 31:18.620
I don't see Livi being all miserable
when she's performing.

31:18.777 --> 31:22.281
That's because Livi's a star.
She's always happy.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.017
I'm beginning to doubt that.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.455
Well, you shouldn't.
Zoey, count us back in,

31:27.619 --> 31:29.462
and try not to fumble it.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.123
One, two, three...

31:33.358 --> 31:35.235
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey... ♪</i>

31:35.394 --> 31:38.864
Oh, wow, they're really going at it today.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.034
The Teardrops are becoming
quite the act around town.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.543
They could break through any time now.

31:44.703 --> 31:45.738
Come off it.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.578
Tanya is not even a household name
in her own house-.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.046
Are you jealous?

31:51.209 --> 31:54.884
Jealous? Of Tanya? Give me a break.

31:56.381 --> 31:57.485
Listen up, girls.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.459
Mia sent through the hotel plans
and staff schedules.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.325
So that means the staple gun moves
from hereto over here.

32:06.291 --> 32:07.736
Don't you mean here?

32:09.161 --> 32:10.401
No, here.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.165
Hey, this has to be perfectly tuned,

32:13.632 --> 32:16.169
right down to the finest detail.

32:16.334 --> 32:17.608
It's simple.

32:17.769 --> 32:21.410
Staple gun to the lemonade cups,
which leads to the egg canons.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.442
Sounds perfectly tuned.

32:23.608 --> 32:27.522
Seriously, guys,
my whole career's resting on this heist.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.989
There's no time for fooling around.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.526
We're all in this together, Andrea.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.853
When you do become rich and famous,

32:35.020 --> 32:37.296
that's when you can
start acting like a diva.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.493
A diva? <i>Moi?</i>

32:40.025 --> 32:43.029
Says here that the Senior Hotel Maid,
Miss Eisenberg,

32:43.195 --> 32:44.503
is in charge of Livi's room.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.700
So we'll have to sit tight
until she leaves.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.035
That is one scary maid.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.880
What's scary is Mia
by herself at the hotel.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.377
Do you think she's okay'?

32:54.539 --> 32:56.712
Well, she must be
if she sent through the plans.

32:56.875 --> 32:59.822
It's just that she wasn't
entirely down with the heist.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.980
What if she's changed her mind?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.149
Whoa, no one's changing their mind!

33:04.316 --> 33:06.296
We've got to do this. For...

33:06.785 --> 33:08.731
Uh...

33:09.154 --> 33:10.224
For the group!

33:10.455 --> 33:12.731
Yes, Andrea, for the group.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.826
Oh.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.072
I just hope Mia's okay.

33:22.133 --> 33:25.706
So this is what freedom really feels like.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.915
Pretty cool, huh?

33:30.242 --> 33:31.585
What can I get you girls?

33:31.843 --> 33:35.416
Uh, one small scoop of vanilla, please.

33:35.580 --> 33:39.426
Scratch that!
We want to have a scoop of every flavor.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.188
Single or ginormous scoop?

33:43.321 --> 33:45.494
One octuple-decker!

33:45.891 --> 33:47.029
Coming right up.

33:47.425 --> 33:50.770
Sorry, I'm not used to
making decisions by myself.

33:50.929 --> 33:54.399
One octuple-decker coming up
and one regular. Enjoy.

33:58.603 --> 34:01.607
"A moment on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips."

34:01.773 --> 34:02.774
What'?

34:02.941 --> 34:04.943
Something my personal trainer <i>says.</i>

34:05.110 --> 34:07.215
If he could see me now...

34:07.379 --> 34:10.292
But you won't tell anyone, will you?

34:10.614 --> 34:12.356
Your secret's safe with me!

34:12.784 --> 34:13.922
Pinky swear'?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.791
I'm down with that.
Pinky swear.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.934
This is so amazing.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.973
I've missed living in the real world.

34:27.599 --> 34:31.045
It's funny, a lot of girls
would love to live your life.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.078
I know one in particular.

34:33.271 --> 34:35.547
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

34:35.706 --> 34:40.315
It's just a shallow world with everyone
too concerned with raking in money,

34:40.478 --> 34:43.254
leeching off my fame
and bossing me around.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.659
Oh, that sounds rough.

34:45.884 --> 34:47.989
Sometimes. Hmm.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.764
You know, I used to write songs,
just for fun.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.125
But I don't even have time for that.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.601
They're all just given to me now.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.686
Look, uh, Livi.

35:14.412 --> 35:18.588
There's something I need to ask you.
You might not like it, but...

35:18.750 --> 35:20.787
You know, I don't want to talk about me.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.489
Right now, I want to hear all about you.

35:23.655 --> 35:27.831
Tell me what it's like to be normal.
What do you do every day?

35:28.693 --> 35:33.540
Well. Me and my friends,
we do everything together.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.469
Help each other with our homework,

35:35.634 --> 35:38.478
go to the mall,
and do window shopping on Saturday.

35:38.770 --> 35:41.341
Or we laugh about silly stuff guys do.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.050
Or despair.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.286
Yeah. And we play in a band.

35:47.512 --> 35:48.547
You do'?

35:49.214 --> 35:51.626
Actually, that's what I wanted to...

35:51.783 --> 35:53.353
More, tell me more.

35:54.152 --> 35:59.397
Well, we skateboard, generally hang out,
and sometimes make funny videos.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.059
That sounds wonderful.

36:01.626 --> 36:05.301
The best thing is, whenever
any of us get ourselves in a pickle,

36:05.463 --> 36:07.143
the others are always there
to help us out.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:09.401 --> 36:12.382
Sometimes, it's almost like
we're the same person.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.847
We just mean so much to each other.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.683
Sounds too good to be true.

36:18.209 --> 36:21.520
Well, it's not all sweetness and light.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.421
Andrea, our lead singer...

36:23.581 --> 36:27.256
Oh, yeah, your band.
I would love to hear you guys play.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.763
Well, you kind of have already.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.595
You see, your new song is actually...

36:32.757 --> 36:36.204
Reach Out a thousand times a day.

36:38.363 --> 36:41.276
So much for freedom.
We got to get outta here!

36:41.733 --> 36:42.837
This was'!

36:48.273 --> 36:50.753
Impressive evasion skills!

36:50.942 --> 36:54.913
When you walk dogs as much as I do,
you get to know every short cut there is!

36:55.080 --> 36:57.253
You really helped me out of a jam.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.686
My pleasure.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.619
Friends?

37:00.952 --> 37:02.124
Friends.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.793
Let's hang out again soon.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.036
- I'd like that.
- Livi!

37:07.926 --> 37:12.807
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I hear the sounds
of an angry studio manager!

37:12.964 --> 37:14.910
- Livia'
- Quick! Over there.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.115
There you are! We've been worried sick!

37:20.472 --> 37:21.473
Hmm.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.147
Who's with you'?

37:24.309 --> 37:25.879
I thought I heard voices.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.715
If someone abducted you,

37:27.879 --> 37:31.156
I'd have the chief of police lock them up
and throw away the key!

37:33.318 --> 37:38.063
Relax, Megan. I wasn't with anyone.
I just went out for an ice cream.

37:38.289 --> 37:41.793
Ice cream? Say it ain't so!

37:41.960 --> 37:43.906
An octuple-decker!

37:44.062 --> 37:45.166
No!

37:47.632 --> 37:50.112
I think you should
retire to your room, dear.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.942
It's been a trying day.

37:53.471 --> 37:56.350
Come on, Cookie, it's nap time.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.079
Uh-uh, no sleep for you, ice cream lady.

37:59.244 --> 38:01.690
We got to burn those calories. Pronto.

38:09.988 --> 38:14.130
Well, well, if it isn't
Little Miss Livi Impersonator.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.464
Megan, I...

38:15.627 --> 38:19.040
I don't want you
walking Livi's dog anymore.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.174
But Cookie really likes me.

38:21.332 --> 38:22.970
Cookie likes everyone.

38:23.334 --> 38:24.540
And Livi and I are...

38:24.702 --> 38:25.840
What'?

38:26.004 --> 38:27.039
Friends.

38:27.705 --> 38:31.448
Ha! Livi is a star.
She has fans. Not friends.

38:31.609 --> 38:33.714
- But we...
- There's no we.

38:33.878 --> 38:36.188
There is only you. And right now,

38:36.981 --> 38:38.051
you're fired.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.702
Okay, starlets, we're ready to rock.

38:47.892 --> 38:50.133
Mia. Are you okay?

38:50.562 --> 38:51.802
Just.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.031
Where have you been'?

38:53.565 --> 38:54.669
At the hotel.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.073
All this time'?

38:56.301 --> 38:58.542
Um, I got caught up.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.478
Never mind. You're here now.

39:00.638 --> 39:03.050
Look, here's Livi's limo.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.079
And this is the penthouse.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.086
Livi will be in the limo
on her way to the hotel,

39:09.247 --> 39:11.591
so we've got to, create a diversion

39:11.749 --> 39:14.753
and break into
Livi's penthouse. Simple.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.422
I'm not crazy about this.

39:17.689 --> 39:21.364
Livi isn't a bad person.
I don't think she stole the song.

39:21.593 --> 39:25.905
Oh, please. You saw her
at the press conference. She stole it.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.907
I don't think she knows she stole it.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.205
And you know this because?

39:31.102 --> 39:33.446
I just have a feeling, that's all.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.916
Well, I have a feeling
that we're going to get our song back.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.282
But we need to work as a team.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.552
So, Mia, this is it.

39:41.913 --> 39:45.019
It's all or nothing. Are you in or out'?

39:45.917 --> 39:46.918
Um...

39:47.418 --> 39:49.523
But how do you know the plan will work?

39:49.787 --> 39:51.960
Stephanie, you own the room.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.969
Okay, we need to create a distraction
to keep Livi away from the hotel.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.038
That's where you come in, Emma.

39:59.430 --> 40:03.901
<i>Livi's driver will be waiting for her
outside the studio at exactly 3:30.</i>

40:04.068 --> 40:08.642
<i>♪ Another day, wake up, hit the floor... ♪</i>

40:08.806 --> 40:09.978
Heck of a day, isn't it?

40:10.141 --> 40:13.554
Megan sent me to give you a glass
of super healthy carrot and papaya juice.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.782
To cool you down. Cheers.

40:17.649 --> 40:20.823
Oh, boy, what a klutz. Let me help you.

40:22.453 --> 40:25.229
You should clean up in the restroom.
I'll make you another juice.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.165
Uh, don't bother.
Just-Please, stay away.

40:31.162 --> 40:34.837
Subject has been juiced.
Repeat, subject has been juiced.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.673
<i>Good job, Emma,
proceed immediately to phase two.</i>

41:08.766 --> 41:12.111
Phase two complete. Phase two complete.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.174
Livi!

41:16.341 --> 41:19.720
<i>Once the diversion's in place,
we initiate phase three,</i>

41:19.877 --> 41:21.220
<i>the hotel.</i>

41:23.548 --> 41:26.893
<i>The objective
is to get into Livi's room unnoticed.</i>

41:27.051 --> 41:29.361
<i>Which means we go in undercover.</i>

41:35.159 --> 41:36.160
Hmm.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.735
<i>Olivia will be in
the air conditioning system,</i>

41:39.897 --> 41:41.001
<i>getting a head start.</i>

41:44.035 --> 41:47.744
<i>Now we're in position,
this is where the fun starts.</i>

41:48.339 --> 41:50.649
At the next junction, turn left.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.916
<i>At the next junction, turn left.</i>

41:55.847 --> 41:57.607
Hold that elevator.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.765
Which ﬂoor?

42:07.091 --> 42:08.161
Penthouse.

42:10.928 --> 42:12.999
Drive ten feet. Stop.

42:13.164 --> 42:15.405
- Did you say something?
- I didn't.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.840
Reverse five feet.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.036
<i>$109-</i>

42:19.370 --> 42:22.249
<i>Now drive 20 feet. Stop.</i>

42:25.610 --> 42:28.113
<i>Check your mirrors. Proceed.</i>

42:32.683 --> 42:35.857
Uh, I know you, don't I?

42:36.020 --> 42:40.093
Uh, me? I don't think so,
it's my first day on the job.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.204
We're all very nervous.

42:43.795 --> 42:44.796
- Well, we gotta go. Bye.
- Gotta go. Bye.

42:44.962 --> 42:46.362
- Thanks a lot. Bye.
- Bye.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.406
Bingo.

42:53.271 --> 42:57.276
Alert, alert.
Miss Eisenberg's in the room.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.119
What do we do?

43:01.279 --> 43:02.314
<i>Leave it is me.</i>

43:07.485 --> 43:10.489
What, where's the fire? Fire?

43:11.322 --> 43:12.596
Fire!

43:13.991 --> 43:16.301
Quick. Evacuate the building.

43:16.461 --> 43:19.169
That means, everybody out!

43:20.731 --> 43:21.971
Come on.

43:26.838 --> 43:27.839
Good work, Olivia.

43:28.005 --> 43:31.612
Now let's get busy
and find that memory stick.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.686
Wow!

43:36.781 --> 43:37.953
<i>Zowie.</i>

43:38.449 --> 43:42.989
The other half lives in open plan.
I love the design.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.464
Proceed into roundabout.

43:45.623 --> 43:49.594
And I am so going to
get used to living like this.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.866
Girls, snap out of it.
We have to find our demo.

43:53.264 --> 43:56.302
Everyone, start looking around.
I'll search the closet.

44:06.544 --> 44:09.718
There's too much stuff.
We'll never find it.

44:11.115 --> 44:12.890
Fame sure has its perks.

44:13.050 --> 44:16.725
With Livi's kind of money,
I could finance my own science lab

44:16.888 --> 44:17.958
on the moon.

44:18.289 --> 44:22.829
Ladies. We can't get distracted.
Speaking of distractions, where is Andrea?

44:23.027 --> 44:26.565
Oh, I could so rock out
while wearing this.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.402
Girls, I can't believe I'm actually here.

44:31.068 --> 44:33.070
Selfie face.

44:33.638 --> 44:36.244
Andrea. That's the fifth dress
you've tried on.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.717
Take it off
and search for the memory stick.

44:38.876 --> 44:42.483
I am almost done searching.
Livi only has another dozen or so.

44:43.748 --> 44:49.426
Andrea, if you won't help us search,
at least keep the driver distracted.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.169
Hmm, continue in roundabout.
Continue in...

44:56.227 --> 45:01.040
Winning this Grammy Award
means so much to me, thank you.

45:01.199 --> 45:04.669
Hey, is anyone else hungry
after all this excitement?

45:08.439 --> 45:11.420
Room service'? Room 237 calling.

45:11.576 --> 45:15.023
Send up the fudge mountain ice cream
with tons of sprinkles.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.456
Andrea, Livi's here.

45:28.893 --> 45:32.466
Look at what we've done.
We've totally trashed the place.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.607
We've only got one option.

45:42.373 --> 45:44.444
Uh-oh, it's a dead end.

45:45.476 --> 45:47.888
And it's impossible to turn around.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.149
There's no choice.

45:56.921 --> 45:59.333
What's going on?

45:59.824 --> 46:00.825
Oh!

46:07.131 --> 46:10.112
Wow, that girl's got some scream.

46:10.268 --> 46:12.270
Wait until room service arrives.

46:15.740 --> 46:18.277
What is going on? I don't want this.

46:18.743 --> 46:20.518
But it has extra sprinkles.

46:20.745 --> 46:22.747
Please, take it away.

46:24.815 --> 46:26.590
What's all the commotion about?

46:31.255 --> 46:33.166
This can't be happening.

46:34.358 --> 46:35.428
Mia.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.371
I should have guessed.
They're just thieves.

46:42.166 --> 46:44.112
I can't believe it.

46:44.435 --> 46:47.712
Oh, Livi, Livi,
I could have spared you this.

46:47.872 --> 46:50.216
But you deserve to know the truth.

46:50.374 --> 46:52.376
No matter how much it hurts.

46:52.710 --> 46:54.383
All she wants is a piece of you.

46:54.545 --> 46:58.186
No. She... She... She's my friend.

46:58.349 --> 47:03.196
She's a two-bit souvenir scavenger.
Socks, hairbrushes, pillow cases.

47:03.354 --> 47:06.335
They'll take anything
they can get their sticky fingers on.

47:06.891 --> 47:09.565
I can't believe she was just using me,

47:10.194 --> 47:11.468
like everyone else.

47:11.629 --> 47:14.576
Mia and her misfits
are just more crazy fans

47:14.732 --> 47:17.144
trying to burst their way
into your bubble.

47:17.535 --> 47:19.173
I... I...

47:19.570 --> 47:21.880
Livi, do you understand, dear?

47:22.239 --> 47:23.411
I want to be alone.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.558
Well, that went well.

47:32.717 --> 47:36.597
I don't get it.
Livi's ridiculously talented. Right?

47:36.754 --> 47:37.755
Right.

47:37.922 --> 47:40.232
So then why would she steal our song?

47:40.391 --> 47:43.099
Actually, I don't think she did.

47:43.761 --> 47:46.605
Oh, please, fame has obviously
gone to her head.

47:46.764 --> 47:49.005
The little people no longer matter.

47:49.166 --> 47:51.669
I don't think she knows the song is ours.

47:51.836 --> 47:53.679
But she said she wrote it.

47:53.871 --> 47:54.872
I don't think she did.

47:55.039 --> 47:57.781
Olivia, can you play
the press conference back?

47:59.877 --> 48:02.790
Scroll to the exact point
that Stephanie asks.

48:02.947 --> 48:04.051
Oh, there.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.626
<i>Did you personally write that song?</i>

48:06.784 --> 48:08.889
<i>Well, sometimes,
the words come fully formed,</i>

48:09.053 --> 48:11.124
<i>like they were destined only for me.</i>

48:11.389 --> 48:14.097
- See?
<i>- I'll</i> give her destiny, all right.

48:14.258 --> 48:17.068
Fame has obviously gone to her head.

48:17.261 --> 48:21.073
No, all she really wants
is to be just like us.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.643
How do you know that?

48:23.033 --> 48:24.535
I made friends with her.

48:24.702 --> 48:26.045
You did? With Livi?

48:26.203 --> 48:28.581
We went to the park and ate ice cream.

48:28.806 --> 48:29.807
Together?

48:29.974 --> 48:31.954
Why didn't you tell us?

48:32.109 --> 48:34.146
Because I knew you'd react like this.

48:35.212 --> 48:36.316
That's okay, Mia.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.253
It... It is'?

48:38.449 --> 48:40.952
I know what's really going on here.

48:41.118 --> 48:42.153
You do'?

48:42.319 --> 48:45.926
Yeah. You want all the fame for yourself.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.502
There's only one person here
who wants all the fame

48:48.659 --> 48:49.763
and that's you.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.998
Now, now. Girls, play nice.

48:52.163 --> 48:56.077
It's okay, Stephanie. She's right.
I do want fame.

48:56.233 --> 49:00.010
But I want to share it with my friends.
Remember them?

49:00.404 --> 49:03.851
Girls, this is getting way out of hand.

49:04.008 --> 49:06.181
And I'm getting way out of here.

49:06.343 --> 49:08.016
Mia, where are you going'?

49:08.179 --> 49:12.184
To speak with Livi,
and then, I expect an apology.

49:12.416 --> 49:13.827
Mia, wait.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.494
We should go after her.

49:16.654 --> 49:19.692
Why? We're only in this mess
'cause of her.

49:19.924 --> 49:23.269
We need to focus on a new plan
to get my song back.

49:29.033 --> 49:31.946
Mary, how nice of you to drop by.

49:32.303 --> 49:36.718
I have just about had enough of you.
I need to talk to Livi.

49:36.874 --> 49:39.013
Livi doesn't need to talk to you.

49:39.176 --> 49:43.056
And if all you want to do is talk,
why did you sneak into her hotel room?

49:43.347 --> 49:44.348
Uh, uh...

49:44.615 --> 49:46.561
Is this what you were looking for?

49:46.717 --> 49:49.220
That's ours. Give it back.

49:49.553 --> 49:51.055
Why, of course.

49:51.222 --> 49:54.726
I just have to make
a teensy, weensy little downgrade.

49:58.195 --> 49:59.640
Here you go.

50:01.131 --> 50:04.010
<i>Looks like your music careers
in pieces, Mia.</i>

50:05.069 --> 50:07.675
A broken record.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.815
You can stay away from Livi.
She knows you're not her friend.

50:13.978 --> 50:17.255
Yeah, your hooliganism
was caught on camera.

50:18.482 --> 50:19.688
Camera.

50:20.217 --> 50:21.890
Caught on camera.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.665
Thanks, Tanya.

50:27.191 --> 50:30.070
So, as the universe is challenging me,

50:30.427 --> 50:31.929
I've written another song.

50:32.229 --> 50:35.403
<i>♪ Black clouds hang in the sky ♪</i>

50:35.566 --> 50:38.706
<i>♪ Another rainy day ♪</i>

50:38.869 --> 50:41.577
<i>♪ I try to write this song ♪</i>

50:41.739 --> 50:44.413
<i>♪ But my ideas are so lame ♪</i>

50:44.608 --> 50:45.609
Oh!

50:46.610 --> 50:47.953
- Uh...
- Uh...

50:48.112 --> 50:52.185
Um, that's a little on the angry side.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.131
Ugh. Oh, no. Anybody have a barf bag?

50:58.422 --> 51:00.424
You're not gonna believe this.

51:00.591 --> 51:02.969
<i>Hi, to all my followers out there.</i>

51:03.360 --> 51:04.805
Yeah, all two of them.

51:04.962 --> 51:06.964
Shh, maybe we can pick something up.

51:07.264 --> 51:11.110
<i>Tanya here, rehearsing with my band,
The Teardrops.</i>

51:11.268 --> 51:14.613
<i>We're all super excited
about Livi's Girl In A Bubble concert</i>

51:14.772 --> 51:16.911
<i>at the Heartlake City Arena.</i>

51:17.141 --> 51:18.779
You know what this means.

51:18.943 --> 51:22.481
Once Livi plays our song
at the concert, it's all over.

51:22.646 --> 51:24.956
We won't have any chance
of getting credit.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.287
Oh, no.

51:26.450 --> 51:29.158
This is going to be televised
all over the world.

51:29.320 --> 51:32.893
Face it, you guys,
we're never going to be pop stars.

51:33.390 --> 51:35.666
There goes my yoga studio.

51:36.794 --> 51:39.331
Hmm, the FlowerCam is almost full.

51:39.496 --> 51:41.339
What do I do
to free up some space, Olivia?

51:41.599 --> 51:43.679
If you don't want to keep it,
just delete it.

51:43.901 --> 51:44.902
Huh?

51:45.336 --> 51:46.815
Hi, Mia. <i>Mia?</i>

51:48.572 --> 51:49.573
Did you get it?

51:50.941 --> 51:53.319
- You got it,
- The memory stick.

51:53.510 --> 51:56.013
The memory stick.

51:57.014 --> 51:59.824
The FlowerCam. Don't delete it.

52:00.084 --> 52:04.191
Actually, I think we might need
this particular section right here.

52:04.355 --> 52:06.494
<i>♪ Bring on the lights,
set the stage ♪</i>

52:06.690 --> 52:08.192
<i>♪ In the mood to celebrate ♪</i>

52:08.359 --> 52:09.804
<i>♪ We'll stick together through whatever
Hand in hand ♪</i>

52:09.994 --> 52:11.268
- Finally.
- Proof.

52:11.428 --> 52:15.376
Now, all we got to do is find a way
into the Heartlake City Arena

52:15.532 --> 52:17.034
and show this to Livi.

52:17.201 --> 52:20.546
Forget it, Mia.
Livi's had her chance to tell the truth.

52:20.704 --> 52:23.981
Before the concert starts,
we'll play this... Ta-da!

52:24.141 --> 52:26.314
On the Arena's giant screen.

52:26.877 --> 52:29.187
- We can do that, right, Olivia?
- Su re thing.

52:29.346 --> 52:32.987
And everyone will see for themselves
it's our song.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.960
But that would ruin Livi's reputation.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.690
And your point is?

52:37.855 --> 52:40.529
Come on, you two.
Time to kiss and make up.

52:40.691 --> 52:43.900
No, she's just trying to put me
into a guilt trip.

52:44.061 --> 52:45.369
And you're the one guilty.

52:45.529 --> 52:47.531
Okay, okay. Knock it off.

52:47.898 --> 52:50.902
Let's just focus on
getting the FlowerCam to the concert.

52:51.068 --> 52:54.413
But how do we get in?
We don't even have tickets.

52:54.672 --> 52:56.743
I have a plan.

52:57.241 --> 53:00.245
A quick analysis
of your previous plans concludes

53:00.411 --> 53:01.515
I have a better one.

53:02.813 --> 53:04.417
Megan will have tight security,

53:04.581 --> 53:07.425
so we're going to have to be
clinically precise.

53:07.584 --> 53:10.531
We need to gather
a specific quantity of materials

53:10.688 --> 53:14.602
and unite them in a unique process
to guarantee success.

53:14.758 --> 53:18.433
Source 72 boxes of gelatin,
five cans of coconut oil,

53:18.595 --> 53:22.839
three squid, forty snails
and a 20-pound octopus.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.278
Hi, Megan. I've been thinking...

53:29.440 --> 53:31.613
How many times have I told you
not to do that, Tanya?

53:31.775 --> 53:34.016
It'll give you wrinkles.
Leave the thinking to me.

53:34.178 --> 53:37.022
Sure, Megan, but the thing is,
who's going to believe

53:37.181 --> 53:39.684
you wrote that heartwarming song
we took from Mia?

53:39.850 --> 53:41.557
And why not exactly?

53:41.719 --> 53:44.962
The song's all about being yourself,
no matter what anyone thinks

53:45.122 --> 53:48.865
and refusing to be controlled,
but you love controlling people.

53:49.026 --> 53:50.733
You're a massive control freak.

53:50.928 --> 53:54.137
Ah! Take that back,
I am not a control freak.

53:54.298 --> 53:57.802
Repeat after me,
"Megan is not a control freak."

53:57.968 --> 53:59.970
Say it 30 times, no, 40.

54:00.137 --> 54:01.309
See what I mean?

54:01.472 --> 54:06.148
Okay, it's true. I can be
a complete and utter control freak.

54:06.310 --> 54:08.256
But that's why I wrote the song

54:08.412 --> 54:12.292
as a yearning heartfelt wishing
I could be less control freaky

54:12.449 --> 54:15.487
and more kind and sensitive
and friendly kind of thing, you know?

54:15.719 --> 54:16.720
Hmm...

54:16.920 --> 54:20.493
Hey, are you even listening?
Repeat back what I just said 50 times.

54:20.657 --> 54:22.830
But Megan, you didn't write the song.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.161
I know.

54:24.328 --> 54:26.308
Tanya, you look uneasy.

54:26.663 --> 54:29.109
I am not really sure what to think,

54:29.266 --> 54:33.442
but remember you said I can be rich and
famous and make a gazillion new friends?

54:33.604 --> 54:34.605
Vaguely.

54:34.772 --> 54:38.083
Well, The Teardrops and me
have recorded our new song.

54:38.242 --> 54:40.153
Great. Play it to the writers.

54:40.310 --> 54:43.519
But I have it right here, already mixed.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.626
Okay, give it to me.

54:46.183 --> 54:49.187
You're not going to
break it on me, are you?

54:49.953 --> 54:51.489
Why would I do that'!

54:51.655 --> 54:53.862
Don't worry, I'll look after it.

54:55.826 --> 54:58.705
Now run along
with your little Lemon Drops.

54:58.996 --> 55:00.873
I have to get a show on the road.

55:01.999 --> 55:05.378
Keep an eye out.
Alert me at the first sign of any trouble.

55:05.536 --> 55:06.537
Yes.

55:09.006 --> 55:10.314
Come on, Livi,

55:10.474 --> 55:11.714
time to shine.

55:18.615 --> 55:20.492
That's fantastic.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.564
This show is going to
knock everyone's socks off.

55:23.887 --> 55:26.731
Uh, not the smoothest of rides.

55:26.890 --> 55:29.564
A girl could really
get messed up on there.

55:30.027 --> 55:31.028
Hmm...

55:31.562 --> 55:35.408
Where's the bubble?
And I want the kinks ironed out, ASAP.

55:35.566 --> 55:39.912
That thing is a death trap.
Darling, come with me.

55:46.810 --> 55:50.587
You take five in your dressing room
to calm yourself down

55:50.747 --> 55:54.092
and help put that
Mandy girl out of your mind.

55:54.351 --> 55:57.332
- Mia.
- Yes, and the other three.

55:57.821 --> 55:58.822
<i>Four.</i>

56:04.595 --> 56:05.596
Hmm...

56:07.231 --> 56:09.677
I can't believe Mia betrayed me.

56:10.267 --> 56:13.510
She seemed so friendly, normal.

56:14.938 --> 56:17.885
So maybe there's only one person
I can rely on

56:18.041 --> 56:21.181
to hang outwith
and have a totally normal time.

56:21.378 --> 56:22.914
And that's me.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.454
You know what I'd like to be doing
right now?

56:25.682 --> 56:28.629
Just chilling out. Gardening at home.

56:28.785 --> 56:31.766
No tour, no fans, no staff.

56:32.122 --> 56:33.465
Just little old me.

56:51.441 --> 56:53.978
Oh, well. Back to reality.

56:56.280 --> 56:59.227
<i>Livi! Livi! Livi!</i>

57:00.417 --> 57:01.657
<i>Livi!</i>

57:15.666 --> 57:17.577
Special delivery for Livi!

57:18.235 --> 57:20.511
Uh, it's not on the list.

57:20.671 --> 57:22.617
But she won't go on stage without it!

57:23.607 --> 57:26.349
But I can't let you in
if you're not on the list.

57:26.510 --> 57:27.682
We have to hurry!

57:28.278 --> 57:30.189
Sorry! No can do.

57:30.347 --> 57:34.193
Look. It's melting.
Livi demands that it be fresh.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.692
What is that?
Jr's a rare delicacy.

57:36.954 --> 57:40.197
A "rare delicacy," huh? Prove it.

57:43.527 --> 57:47.600
Voilà. Surf and turf surprise
with delicious bits

57:47.764 --> 57:49.505
from seventy five food groups!

57:49.666 --> 57:51.543
Yuck. It looks...

57:51.702 --> 57:54.308
Delicious. Here, try some!

58:11.054 --> 58:14.968
Okay, girls. Time to get our ninjas on!

58:25.402 --> 58:27.040
You brought beauty products'?

58:27.204 --> 58:28.308
On a mission?

58:28.472 --> 58:29.644
Just in case.

58:30.040 --> 58:33.385
You are officially
starting to scare me now.

58:37.914 --> 58:40.588
Okay, let's get this done.

58:42.486 --> 58:45.160
All right, we can reach the stage
this way.

58:59.736 --> 59:04.947
I just have to initiate contact
with the giant screen and... And...

59:05.208 --> 59:08.746
And what? The suspense is killing me!

59:09.913 --> 59:12.291
And it's not working! We're out of range.

59:12.449 --> 59:14.690
We need to climb up there
and connect it by hand.

59:14.851 --> 59:17.457
Not so fast! Stay where you are.

59:18.622 --> 59:21.728
<i>I said, do not move!</i>

59:22.025 --> 59:24.471
Um, I have to scratch my nose.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.938
Just so we know the rules,
does this count?

59:27.798 --> 59:28.799
<i>Yes!</i>

59:29.132 --> 59:30.304
How about this'?

59:30.467 --> 59:33.471
Hmm, ha, ha, whoa, huh?

59:34.237 --> 59:35.773
<i>Yes! That counts.</i>

59:36.106 --> 59:37.107
Or this?

59:37.407 --> 59:40.820
<i>No! I mean, yes. They all count!</i>

59:41.044 --> 59:42.421
Uh, how about this'?

59:43.313 --> 59:44.314
Come on, girls.

59:44.481 --> 59:46.324
<i>Come back here!</i>

59:46.883 --> 59:48.624
Security, I need backup!

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:07.813
Hmm, trampled or captured? What to do?

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.984
<i>Neither. There're some stairs!</i>

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:18.449
I'd like to thank all my awesome fans
for this amazing honor!

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.009
I hope you've conquered
your fear of heights.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:53.886
- She did it!
- Yeah!

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.665
Now, all I have to do
is turn on the FlowerCam.

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:02.666
Please don't tell me
I dropped it down there!

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:07.068
Sorry for falling behind, ladies.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.506
But I needed to pick up this.

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:10.905
Throw it to me!

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:17.647
I'll take that.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.009
Thank you.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:24.091
Now that the adults are back in charge,
let's go have a little chat.

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:35.031
Fantastic.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:38.105
Looks like we came out of this fiasco
sunny side up.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.580

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:50.882

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.012
No!

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.392
<i>We got a show to run.</i>

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.696
Up there, where it all comes together.

01:02:01.918 --> 01:02:03.454
<i>You girls stay here.</i>

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:05.930
Maybe you can write
another song or something.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:11.037

<i>Livi!</i>

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.742
I guess this means we've failed.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:24.641
We should be up there, all of us,

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:26.788
singing our song.

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:30.147
At least we're here together
now as a group.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:33.089
Right. Guys? Guys?

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.584
Anyone?

01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:43.400
Okay,
I suppose I'll join you then.

Listen, Andrea. I'm sorry.
About everything.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.461
But we've been tricked by Megan.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:44.394
Livi has nothing to do with this.

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:48.525
You're right.
I should apologize, too.

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:52.799
I've been horrible.
It's been a little difficult.

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:55.907
How about we settle
on being friends again?

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:59.409
That's the best plan yet.

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:06.342

how are we going to get out of here?

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.561
Anyone for a little remodeling?

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:14.918
Hmm...

Mia, it's you!

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:42.246
And your friends. Is this for real?

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.417
As real as it gets.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.661
I don't understand. That song...

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.589
Is ours.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:52.926
That's what we were
searching for in your room.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:57.428
Only girls who have true friends
could have written that song.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.400
Megan claims she wrote it,
but I know that song is yours.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:04.374
Yeah.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:08.374
Uh, we've kind of been
trying to tell you that.

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.773
Well then, you better come with me.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:13.547

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:26.462
Security. Stop them!

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:29.102
They should not be allowed
to come into the secured area...

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:31.397
it's all right, they're with me.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:33.896
- What?
- What?

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:36.705
Livi, I...

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:37.867
Megan,

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:39.942
you're fired!

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.641
Yes!

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:45.641
But-But... Oh...

01:10:46.309 --> 01:10:49.085
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:53.453
The game is up, Megan.
Your reputation is in tatters.

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:56.722
You'll probably lose the studio,
you might even go to jail.

01:10:56.886 --> 01:10:59.890
And I'll be selling lemonade
all summer long.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.090
Hmm...

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:07.164
On the other hand, we can dispense
with the tooth rotting sentimentality

01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:10.641
and do what sisters always do.
Bounce back.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:15.479
Hmm, that's catchy, who needs
fame, fortune and friends

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:17.743
when I'm on the winning side'?

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:19.142
Hmm...

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.957
So why didn't you tell me
it was your song?

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:31.826
I tried but you seemed so happy
being normal, just hanging out.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.467
I didn't want to spoil that.

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.530
Wow. You did that for me'?

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.272
That's what I call being a real friend.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:40.963
Aw.

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.007
Livi! Livi!

01:11:57.547 --> 01:12:00.118
Before I sing this awesome new song,

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:01.694
I want to let everyone know

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:05.355
that I'm no longer
a girl all alone in a bubble.
