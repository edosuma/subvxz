00:01.960 --> 00:04.212
Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.

00:04.295 --> 00:05.422
It was 30 years ago.

00:05.505 --> 00:08.383
I was riding around in a police car
with Scott and the first Hooch.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.635
Thanks for helping us pack up his stuff,
David.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.803
He'd love that you're here.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.555
No place I'd rather be.

00:14.472 --> 00:17.058
Mr. Gillen,
our father was investigating you. Why?

00:17.934 --> 00:19.894
Look. I don't know
what your dad was investigating,

00:19.978 --> 00:21.604
but it was a lot bigger than me.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.024
-We gotta find you a somebody, E.
- Mm-hmm.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.316
Somebody like Scott.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.361
Why would you think that?
I never said I liked Scott.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.904
If you were interested,

00:29.988 --> 00:32.240
I just happen to know
his big date fell through.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.618
I wanted to apologize
for forgetting about dinner.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.078
I was driving by your house, so…

00:37.162 --> 00:40.206
That's great. I wish I wasn't
in the middle of giving him a bath.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.334
Do you need help with the bath?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
It looks fantastic. And you know it.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.220
It's really-- It's beautiful shading.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.638
Thank you.
- Anytime.

00:55.722 --> 00:58.892
Thanks for coming down to Cypress Beach
to help with the GuacFest sign.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.519
It was our dad's big thing.
We kind of go overboard.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.522
-I mean, I can't miss Hooch as an avocado.
-

01:04.606 --> 01:05.732
That's true.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.443
Plus, I get to hear the embarrassing
stories from when you were a kid.

01:08.526 --> 01:10.403
-Those were great. Thank you, Mom.
-

01:10.487 --> 01:12.989
I didn't tell her about the time
you almost ran over yourself

01:13.073 --> 01:14.074
with the lawn mower.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.202
Knock, knock.
- This is gonna be good.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.578
-Dropping off the little man.
-Mommy!

01:18.661 --> 01:19.662
Hey, buddy.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.623
Mwah.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.708
Matthew has a surprise.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.293
Show 'em.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.796
Presenting…

01:27.879 --> 01:29.547
guacamolade!

01:29.631 --> 01:31.925
Wow.
- Guacamolade?

01:32.008 --> 01:35.053
It's for the Guacamole Fest
cooking contest.

01:35.136 --> 01:36.805
I dedicate it to Grandpa.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.014
Aw.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.974
Aw, thanks, bud.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.271
-To Dad.
-To Dad.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.234
Wait, drink it slowly. It's chunky.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.405
-

01:56.616 --> 02:00.537
I know moms are supposed to be supportive,
but that was disgusting.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.455
You know what it was like?

02:02.539 --> 02:05.709
It was like he strained guacamole
through an old gym sock,

02:05.792 --> 02:09.587
threw the sock in a blender,
and we drank the sock.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.551
I gotta say, Brooke's a lot less stuck-up
than I remember.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.846
Although, are those really
her painting clothes?

02:17.929 --> 02:19.639
Come on. She looks amazing.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.599
I'm glad you're here for this.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.810
I don't know.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.354
You know, I used to think
Dad's GuacFest thing was corny.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.732
Now I just miss him.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.275
Same.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.318
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.695
Where does Emily keep the bread?

02:33.778 --> 02:36.406
I wanna get a good base
before I try the guacamolade.

02:36.489 --> 02:39.534
-The bread'll help soak up the toxins.
-I'm not sure that's how that works.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.745
-Yeah, it does.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.874
Oh. Hey, Laura. By the way,

02:46.541 --> 02:49.210
those police files you asked for,
they're crazy popular.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.505
Mayor Sutton came down to my office,
asked for the exact same ones.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.759
He told me not to say anything
or I could lose my job.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.719
So don't say anything.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.431
Okay, that's weird.
Why is David reading Dad's files?

03:01.514 --> 03:03.141
Should we be looking into David?

03:03.224 --> 03:06.144
Looking into the guy who hid
our Easter eggs when we were kids?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.021
He was Dad's best friend.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.648
Scott, Dad was keeping this a secret.
Anybody could be involved.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.444
Look, I love David too,
but if he's threatening Grady's job?

03:15.403 --> 03:16.446
Uncle Scott!

03:16.529 --> 03:19.240
Your girlfriend drank
the guacamolade too quickly.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.243
She's puking in the mailbox.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.537
-Wait, Scott. Meet me tomorrow night.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.289
-Laura, I gotta go help Brooke.
-Promise me.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.500
Yeah. Okay, fine. Yes, I promise.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.502
She's throwing up a lot.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.586
Thank you.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.714
It's gross.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.847
Thank you.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.978
Hooch ate Grady's entire loaf of bread.
How is he still hungry?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.564
Oh, Hooch is always hungry.
That's why he's built like a dinosaur.

04:33.732 --> 04:36.776
I'm so sorry about today
and you ruining your silk blouse.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.861
No, it's okay.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.780
I always wanted to "guac this way."

04:42.157 --> 04:44.242
-Let me get you a water or something.
-Thanks.

04:46.077 --> 04:50.165
So I guess your dad was, like,
Mr. Cypress Beach.

04:50.790 --> 04:53.793
-Did you always wanna be a cop like him?
-Not exactly like him.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.172
My dad was kind of a softy
as far as cops go.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.300
Like, when I was 12,
he ticketed this guy for vagrancy

05:00.383 --> 05:03.511
and then he let him stay
in our guest room for a week.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.222
-Oh, yeah.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.975
You know, it's part of the reason
why I joined the Marshals,

05:09.059 --> 05:11.644
'cause, like,
we chase the bad guys, you know?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.480
It's far less complicated

05:13.563 --> 05:17.025
and you don't end up with a drifter
named Safety Pin using your toothbrush.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.612
Well, speaking of family,

05:20.695 --> 05:24.699
my dad has this charity event
on Saturday at the club,

05:24.783 --> 05:27.535
and it's your basic black-tie,
meet-a-senator,

05:27.619 --> 05:29.079
picture-with-an-astronaut type thing.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.748
-I know. Super lame.
-Hmm.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.835
But, um, any chance you'd, uh, be my date?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.004
Sure.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.799
Sounds like a very low-pressure way
of meeting your parents.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.051
You are funny.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.637
They're gonna love you.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.514
How are you at ballroom dancing?

05:48.890 --> 05:50.141
I'm okay.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.811
Yeah. Uh, wait. This isn't a test, right?

05:52.894 --> 05:54.646
Your parents aren't gonna
hate me if I can't--

05:54.729 --> 05:55.730
Not at all.

05:55.814 --> 05:59.025
Although, they went on for years
about this guy that I dated in college

05:59.109 --> 06:01.820
who didn't know the difference
between a Viennese and American waltz.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.279
What?
-Yeah.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.700
So basic. Loser.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.789
-One, two, three.
-

06:12.872 --> 06:14.666
One, two, three.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.960
-One, two, three.
- And promenade. Yes.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.546
-One, two, three.
-Is that a-- Is that a backstep? What--

06:19.629 --> 06:22.465
-Hold her hand lightly.
-These people look miserable.

06:22.549 --> 06:26.011
-One, two, three. One, two, three.
-One, two, three. One, two, three.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.470
-Oh, wonderful.
-

06:27.554 --> 06:29.055
-Steady!
-Ooh.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.306
-Thank you.
-Easy.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.726
-You okay?
- Yeah.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.187
I was just watching this YouTube tutorial
on how to ballroom dance.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.315
Brooke invited me to this thing,
and I kinda told her I can waltz.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.984
I'd like to waltz with you one day.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.236
For sure.

06:44.738 --> 06:48.408
And one, two, three. One, two, three.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.993
Feel the rhythm.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.162
Wonderful.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.623
Might wanna nail down walking
before you start ballroom dancing.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.710
So, you're doing this for Brooke?

06:59.544 --> 07:03.506
She do any of the stuff you like to do?
Like, say, jogging?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.300
Oh, Brooke hates jogging.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.719
Something about a $200 blowout,
whatever that is.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.803
Hmm.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.808
But Erica jogs with you, doesn't she?

07:13.892 --> 07:15.977
Yeah. Erica's great. She's a great friend.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.104
-Conference room now. Emergency briefing.
-Great.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.317
Bye.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.568
All right, everyone.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.612
We've got an all-hands-on-deck
type situation here.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.906
Sonoma County PD has requested our help.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.868
They attempted to arrest William Jackson,
41, for assaulting his landlord.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.745
Turns out he's former special forces.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.498
Security cameras at Jackson's work
captured this video.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.427
Way to stick the landing.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.763
I'm pretty sure he's the bad guy.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.391
Good landing's a good landing.

07:54.891 --> 07:55.975
Ooh.
- Ouch.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.978
Trent Havelock's
deputy in charge on the manhunt.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.355
Thanks, Chief.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.648
Big Dog likes to hunt.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.942
-Yeah, he does. Hunt, Big Dog.
-

08:04.025 --> 08:05.652
He's calling himself Big Dog now?

08:05.735 --> 08:09.406
Oh, he got vanity plates.
He's really trying to make it a thing.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.617
Now, listen up. We don't know
what we're dealing with here, so we--

08:12.701 --> 08:15.120
Yeah, we do. The guy freaked out
'cause he didn't wanna pay rent.

08:15.704 --> 08:19.165
The head case spent too much time in
the sandbox and can't hack it stateside.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.458
-Huh.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.003
You got something to say?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.879
Yeah. Couple things.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.008
First, you were in the National Guard
in New Jersey.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.469
You don't get to say "sandbox"
unless you mean the Jersey Shore.

08:31.553 --> 08:35.473
And second,
a lot of these guys suffer from PTSD.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.850
What makes you the expert?

08:36.933 --> 08:40.061
Just two tours in Afghanistan
while you were guarding saltwater taffy.

08:41.396 --> 08:44.441
And you need to remember
who the DIC is on this, X.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.735
Oh, I remember, T.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.570
Enough. Both of you.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.072
We're all on the same team.

08:51.156 --> 08:55.035
Our fugitive was last spotted by a pack of
scouts near Muir Woods, in Marin County.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.327
The redwoods are dense.

08:56.411 --> 09:01.541
PD's asked us to cover down in this area,
north and west of these hills.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.419
Now, let's bring Jackson in
before someone gets hurt.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.920
-Mm-hmm.
- Dismissed.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.968
Yo, are you sure that was a good idea,
getting into it with Trent?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.386
You think he'll take it personal?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.305
-Probably.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.268
Good one, bro. Good one.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.936
Good job, man.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.314
You know, sometimes
you gotta take the wave,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.192
even if you know you're probably gonna
eat the reef.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.860
Well, yeah, but that's not…

09:28.943 --> 09:30.737
Like, isn't it better to take
a different wave,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.572
so you don't smash into the reef?

09:32.655 --> 09:33.740
Mm-mmm.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.284
Time to speak up is the time to speak up.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.537
But you know
that's not an argument, right?

09:39.621 --> 09:41.539
You literally just said
the same thing twice.

09:41.623 --> 09:42.624
It doesn't make it true.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.792
Maybe it does.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.629
Maybe it does.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.553
'Kay, today's assignments.

09:55.637 --> 10:00.100
Jenna, Turner and the dog,
you're with me and the alpha team.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.520
You're with the big boys now,
so don't screw it up.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.606
Xavier,

10:07.399 --> 10:09.484
you're gonna reinterview the scouts
that spotted Jackson.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.610
Copy that.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.446
The little kids, I mean.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.572
I love kids.

10:14.656 --> 10:18.410
Good. And after that you can stand post
at the roadblock at Blackfoot Trail.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.537
-Better standing than sitting.
-The far one.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.871
I was just gonna suggest that.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.832
Right.

10:24.374 --> 10:25.667
Okay, T-squad. Circle up.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.381
Yo, this is what I was saying, bro.
You have more experience than any of us.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.759
And what? He's got you interviewing
little kids and watching a roadblock.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.886
I mean, what do you do now?

10:37.595 --> 10:38.596
I work the case.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.557
But it's a manhunt.
If you're not there, how--

10:40.640 --> 10:42.183
Don't have to be there to be there.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.227
Actually, I'm pretty sure you do.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.396
Can't catch the man
if you're not on the hunt.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.523
You don't have to be there to be there.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.234
Saying things twice.
Is this, like, an all-the-time thing now?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.861
Hey. Let's mount up.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.947
Should I get used--
Okay. Thank you for that.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.676
Gotta love a manhunt
through the woods, right?

11:16.760 --> 11:20.013
Seriously. This is probably
the best assignment ever.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.389
Mm-hmm.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.391
It's like we're in the movie The Fugitive.

11:23.475 --> 11:24.476
-Right?
-Yeah.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.019
"I didn't kill my wife."

11:26.102 --> 11:27.437
"I don't care."

11:29.647 --> 11:33.443
Ah. You're right. You're right.
This is why I joined the Marshals.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.569
Mm-hmm.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.363
Do feel kinda bad though.

11:36.946 --> 11:37.947
What? About X?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.367
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.872
Okay. One at a time, friends.
One at a time.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.249
-So the man you saw--
-He was in a red car!

11:48.333 --> 11:50.960
We saw a cabin
that looked like an old lady's face!

11:51.044 --> 11:52.462
My parents sleep in separate rooms!

11:54.923 --> 11:56.341
Okay, new plan.

11:56.424 --> 12:00.345
Now, if you know something
about the fugitive that you wanna tell me,

12:01.346 --> 12:02.472
raise your hand.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.140
-Me! Me! Me! Me!
-Me! Me! Me! Me!

12:04.224 --> 12:08.061
Now, if you're gonna say the car was red,
put your hand down.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.604
Me. Me.

12:09.688 --> 12:13.775
If you're gonna say the car was reddish,
kinda like a burnt orange,

12:14.526 --> 12:15.568
put your hand down.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.866
Okay, little man. What you gotta tell me?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.451
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:25.537 --> 12:28.164
Oops. Never mind.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.332
Yeah, I've been there.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.710
Okay. That concludes our interview.

12:33.128 --> 12:34.129
Thanks, kids.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.886
All right, guys. We got
some setting up to do, don't we? Careful.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.307
This is the Big Dog.
I'm out saving the world. Leave a message.

12:46.850 --> 12:50.812
Hey, Trent. No new info.
One kid peed himself.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.736
Stay sharp.
Fugitive was seen around here.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.363
Dealing with a wannabe Rambo.
Watch your six.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.740
Copy that.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.034
- Quiet, Hooch.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.245
He could be around here anywhere.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.916
-Hooch?
-

13:13.752 --> 13:15.337
Hooch? Where--

13:17.422 --> 13:19.632
Trent, we need to stop
for a second. So sorry.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.344
Hooch! Where are you going?

13:22.427 --> 13:24.637
Hooch, we're supposed to be
watching our six.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.558
This is definitely not a-- You're peeing?
You taking a little pee break?

13:28.641 --> 13:32.312
Hey! Let's go, Turner!
The fugitive was spotted just up ahead.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.396
Got it.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.648
Hooch,
they're literally leaving us behind.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.108
Come on.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.823
-

13:43.907 --> 13:44.866
I'm coming, Big Dog.

13:46.701 --> 13:47.827
We're not gonna move it.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.039
Those spikes that psycho put there
are stuck up in the engine block.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.958
-Maybe if we all push from the side.
-

13:54.042 --> 13:55.835
Forget it. We tried that.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.588
We tried everything.
This thing's not moving, okay?

13:58.672 --> 14:01.758
We checked the other roads.
Three more booby traps.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.135
There's no clear way in.
Jackson's a one-man army.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.595
Oh, yeah?

14:05.679 --> 14:09.182
Well, we're a lot-of-men army.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.267
Listen. That psycho tried to kill us.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.812
He's messing with the Big Dog.
He's going down!

14:15.313 --> 14:18.942
It's getting late. Get in Turner's truck.
We're going back to base camp. Mount up!

14:19.526 --> 14:20.443
Come on, man.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.864
Everybody good?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.491
It smells like a burrito in here.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.410
Oh, yeah, there was a taco
wedged in the seats,

14:28.493 --> 14:29.577
but Hooch took care of it.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.039
He ate it.
I guess he was waiting for it to ripen.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.207
Hello, this is Baxter.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.667
Command center, this is Big Dog.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.129
-Who?
-It's Trent. Baxter, It's Trent.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.755
Right, new call sign.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.842
Think this will stick
better than T-Man or Falcon,

14:43.925 --> 14:47.012
or that time you saw Top Gun on TV
and wanted to be called Maverick?

14:47.095 --> 14:51.057
Just put in a request for a high-wing
surveillance asset with thermal optics.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.476
We need to catch this fugitive.
Bye. Big Dog out.

14:55.353 --> 14:56.354
This is war now.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.944
He declared war on us.
So we're also gonna declare war.

15:03.987 --> 15:04.988
Double war.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.907
About that. I still can't figure out why.

15:08.783 --> 15:10.618
I mean, Jackson punched his landlord.

15:10.702 --> 15:13.913
That's maybe six months in jail. You know?

15:13.997 --> 15:15.540
Running, that adds five years.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.959
And then fighting the cops,
that's ten to 15 easy.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.170
-I mean, why would he risk--
-He's a criminal.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.590
Criminals do stupid things.
That's what makes them criminals.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.800
-What the hell noise is that?

15:26.384 --> 15:29.596
Uh, do me a favor. Call your buddy Xavier.
Let him know that our orders have changed.

15:32.724 --> 15:33.725
'Sup?

15:33.808 --> 15:34.893
Yo.

15:34.976 --> 15:38.229
Trent called in a search plane.
He's suspending the search till morning.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.314
How's the roadblock?

15:39.397 --> 15:42.817
Quiet. Just putting together a list
of Jackson's known associates

15:42.901 --> 15:44.319
and a basic psych profile.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.279
Seriously? From the roadblock?

15:46.363 --> 15:48.531
Like I said, work the case.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.827
Slow going though.
Laptop ran out of juice. Had to improvise.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.663
Well, you might have
some more time to work.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.957
-Trent wants you out there overnight.
- Copy that.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.043
And tell him thanks.
Could use the overtime.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.796
It's nice to get a chance to focus.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.714
I'll let you know if I find anything.

16:04.798 --> 16:05.799
Okay.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.635
How'd he take it?

16:09.219 --> 16:10.637
Ah, he was just, you know…

16:11.262 --> 16:12.472
Xavier.

16:12.555 --> 16:13.723
He's doing some research.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.393
Research? He's in the middle of nowhere,
doing nothing.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.477
Does he not get that?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.897
You should stay away from that guy.
Something's not right with his brain.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.484
One other thing.
You need to handle this dog sitch, 'kay?

16:24.567 --> 16:27.654
We're jacking up the heat tomorrow.
I don't want that thing slowing us down.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.447
Right. I'm on it.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.713
-Make more noise, amateur.
-

16:44.796 --> 16:45.797
Hi.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.883
Come here, bud.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.138
-Geez. I didn't think you were gonna come.
-It was a long day. What are we doing?

16:53.221 --> 16:56.349
It's a stakeout, okay?
We're waiting till Mayor Sutton leaves.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.518
Do I get to ask
why we're waiting for the mayor to leave?

16:59.102 --> 17:01.521
Because we're gonna sneak into his office,
look around for evidence.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.189
Laura, that's insane.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.941
What's insane?

17:05.025 --> 17:07.318
All the words you just said.
They're insane.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.571
David Sutton is secretly
looking into our dad.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.073
He's our oldest family friend.
Can't we just talk to him?

17:12.157 --> 17:14.909
Then he's gonna know Grady told us,
and Grady will get fired.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.370
Don't you wanna know
why David's keeping secrets from us?

17:17.454 --> 17:18.955
-Oh, my--

17:19.039 --> 17:20.457
Oh. Shh!

17:22.417 --> 17:24.044
There he goes. Okay, let's go.

17:24.127 --> 17:27.422
Laura! I am a deputy marshal.
I can't be part of an illegal search.

17:27.505 --> 17:30.925
Not to mention, any of the evidence
you find will be inadmissible.

17:31.009 --> 17:34.179
Okay, fine. I'll go in alone.
Good night, Deputy Marshal.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.388
-Hooch.
-Laura.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.515
Crazy sister.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.893
Sucks. Terrible comeback.

17:58.161 --> 17:59.329
Ah! Oh.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.956
-Laura.
-Janis! Hi.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.041
Didn't see you there.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.127
How are the guac preparations
coming along?

18:06.211 --> 18:08.046
Guactastic, thanks.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.548
Will a certain four-time Guac Princess
be there?

18:10.632 --> 18:13.843
Oh, you know it.
Getting my waving hand ready.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.053
So what brings you here?

18:15.136 --> 18:18.765
I was, um, just hoping
to see Mayor Sutton. Is he in?

18:18.848 --> 18:20.809
Sorry. He just left for the evening.

18:20.892 --> 18:24.729
Oh, shoot. Um, he was supposed
to leave something for me.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.023
I'm sure it's on his desk.
I could go grab it.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.692
What is it, sweetie? I'll get it.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.945
No. I'll just-- It'll be two seconds.

18:32.028 --> 18:36.866
Oh, normally I would let you,
but he has been really on me about that.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.577
I think one of the interns
is stealing his Snickers.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.996
So if you come back tomorrow,
then I'm sure he'll--

18:42.080 --> 18:44.040
Laura. Time to go.

18:44.749 --> 18:45.750
Hi.

18:45.834 --> 18:50.171
Oh, my gosh. He is adorable.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.756
-

18:51.840 --> 18:52.841
- Hello.

18:52.924 --> 18:54.718
- What kind of doggy is he?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.511
He's a Dogue de Bordeaux.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.513
Dogue de Bordeaux?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.098
-Look at you.
-

19:00.181 --> 19:01.933
-Fancy. Look at that face.
-Don't stop petting him.

19:02.017 --> 19:04.269
-I could just eat him up.
-Me too.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.895
What's his name?

19:05.979 --> 19:08.440
It's Hooch, actually.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.525
Hooch? Hoochy.

19:10.608 --> 19:13.445
I think you want a treat.
I wanna go get him a treat.

19:13.528 --> 19:15.613
-He's diabetic. No-- No treats.
-Oh.

19:16.698 --> 19:17.949
No, no.

19:23.747 --> 19:28.543
Janis, did you change your hair?
- Yes! Thank you for noticing.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.254
-You're glowing.
-Aw.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.140
We can go for walkies. Yes, we can.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.975
You know what's crazy
about this breed,

19:44.059 --> 19:46.811
is that they were originally bred
to guard vineyards in France.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.189
No. Really?
-Yes. You seem like a wine gal.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.941
I do not need that stuff after all.
Thank you so much, Janis.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.402
-Bye! Thank you so much.
-Okay. Thank you, Janis. Ow!

19:54.486 --> 19:55.904
Okay. Bye-bye!

19:55.987 --> 19:57.155
Bye, Hoochy!

20:00.950 --> 20:02.494
Laura. Laura!

20:03.119 --> 20:04.162
Laura, what are you doing?

20:04.245 --> 20:06.915
I am making progress.
He had notes on Dad's case.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.042
-Aren't you curious?
-No! I will not look at that.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.628
I will not be implicated.
Listen. I'm not curious.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.713
I'm angry, okay? This is illegal.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.548
Breaking the rules
because you need to know

20:15.632 --> 20:18.093
if someone betrayed
someone you love is not illegal!

20:18.176 --> 20:19.678
What? Are you making up laws now?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.221
Scott, listen to me.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.181
I want no part of this.
I have work tomorrow.

20:23.264 --> 20:25.016
You know, real police work.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.602
-Come on, Hooch, before we get indicted.
-But--

20:35.276 --> 20:37.278
-

20:38.822 --> 20:41.700
Hooch. Hooch. You gotta wake up, buddy.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.910
We got a long day of tracking ahead,
right?

20:44.577 --> 20:45.870
-Head in the game.
-

20:48.957 --> 20:50.250
-Hello.
- Hey.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.044
I just saw that you texted,
so I thought I'd call.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.338
It's 4:30. You didn't have to.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.716
-Oh, no problem. Yeah.
-

20:58.299 --> 20:59.509
Angel had some bad dreams,

20:59.592 --> 21:01.302
so we're just talking through
her feelings.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.595
What's going on?

21:02.679 --> 21:04.931
Okay. So, I'm part of this manhunt, right?

21:05.015 --> 21:07.726
And it's for this former
special forces guy.

21:07.809 --> 21:12.063
I was hoping that Hooch could track him,
but he just wants to play in the woods.

21:12.147 --> 21:13.356
Was the wind at your backs?

21:14.274 --> 21:16.109
Yeah. How'd you know that?

21:16.192 --> 21:18.236
Special forces are trained
to stay downwind.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.530
Okay? What does that mean?

21:20.613 --> 21:22.032
Is there, like, anything we can do?

21:22.115 --> 21:26.119
There are actually two kinds of scent:
air and ground.

21:26.202 --> 21:31.332
So even if your manhuntee
is staying out of the wind,

21:31.416 --> 21:34.169
he won't be able to hide the scent
of something he's touched.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.964
But ground scents are tough,
though. They take focus.

21:38.048 --> 21:41.259
-Do you think Hooch has enough focus?
-

21:41.343 --> 21:42.344
Yeah.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.472
Uh, I think he definitely has potential.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.724
Mm-hmm. Maybe.

21:48.767 --> 21:50.268
Good luck.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.353
Thanks.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.902
Okay. The sun will be up soon.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.113
Now, the Cessnas picked up
a heat signature

22:02.197 --> 22:03.823
two klicks north of Whitestone Lake.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.325
We'll search that on foot.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.659
-Turner!
-I'm right here.

22:07.535 --> 22:09.120
Oh, yeah. You fix the dog?

22:09.704 --> 22:11.915
-Can that track his scent?
-Jackson's hiding downwind.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.750
If there's a ground scent,
Hooch would definitely--

22:13.833 --> 22:15.085
Okay, nerd.com, enough.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.837
-Next time just say, "My dog sucks."
-Copy that.

22:17.921 --> 22:20.507
Listen up.
We need to get this bandit, all right?

22:20.590 --> 22:21.591
Let's mount up.

22:22.258 --> 22:23.802
Oh, X. I almost forgot.

22:23.885 --> 22:24.969
You're not coming with us,

22:25.053 --> 22:27.889
'cause you are gonna stay here and…
…guard the vehicles.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.225
But wouldn't he
be more useful with us?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.185
What's he guarding the vehicles from?
Raccoons?

22:32.268 --> 22:35.480
Well, what happens if Jackson comes back
and sets more booby traps?

22:35.563 --> 22:38.108
I mean, Xavier here is the expert
on combat vets.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.192
Ain't that right?

22:39.901 --> 22:40.944
I'm on it, Big Dog.

22:41.736 --> 22:42.987
Yeah, you are.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.240
Yeah?

22:56.167 --> 22:59.754
Yeah. It's a rock, Hooch, just like
the thousand other ones you sniffed.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.635
Again? How are you not empty?

23:06.219 --> 23:07.721
Turner,
Jackson's not gonna wait around

23:07.804 --> 23:09.973
-'cause your giant dog has a tiny bladder.
- It's a trip wire.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.474
-Stop! There's a trip wire!
-Where?

23:14.144 --> 23:15.812
Oh, Big Dog.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.647
Oh, it's like that, Jackson?
It's like that?

23:20.900 --> 23:24.779
Thank you. When I was upside down,
a bug went in my mouth.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.282
Hold up, Trent. We'll cut you down.

23:27.365 --> 23:31.745
Bro, I'm CrossFit certified
Level 3, dude. Check the Insta.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.455
I got this.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.883
Trent, uh, is that poison oak?

23:44.966 --> 23:46.134
Huh?

23:46.217 --> 23:48.845
You probably shouldn't be
touching your face.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.936
Scotty! What's going on?

23:57.020 --> 23:59.189
Uh, we hit one of Jackson's booby traps.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.565
Trent's, um…

24:02.567 --> 24:03.610
regrouping.

24:04.194 --> 24:05.987
At least we know we're on the right track.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.322
-What's that?

24:07.405 --> 24:12.243
Birds. I'm pretty close to their nest,
so they've been attacking.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.536
X, where are you?

24:13.620 --> 24:16.373
I needed better data reception,
so I climbed a tree.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.376
I got Jackson's DD 214 from the army.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.336
I'm gonna call guys in his old unit.

24:21.419 --> 24:24.923
Wait. You did all that while in a tree,
being attacked by birds?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.007
I don't mind.

24:26.091 --> 24:28.259
-Nature restores.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.970
I'll check in if I get solid intel.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.890
-Turner!
-Yes. What? I'm right here.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.059
Is my face red?

24:37.811 --> 24:38.812
Nope.

24:48.947 --> 24:50.657
Hooch. Hooch, what do you got, boy?

24:51.449 --> 24:52.909
Gimme that. That's dirty.

24:56.955 --> 24:59.207
Trent. Trent.
I think maybe you should look at this.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.209
What is it, Turner?

25:01.292 --> 25:02.711
Hooch found this dog toy.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.421
We're not far from
where that trip wire was.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.673
And Hooch has been peeing everywhere,
right?

25:07.424 --> 25:09.467
I think Jackson might be traveling
with a dog.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.553
-So what?
-Well…

25:11.636 --> 25:14.889
I mean, you've profiled him to be, like,
this lone, disconnected psychopath.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.517
So he's a disconnected psycho
with a dog. Same difference.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.603
Yeah,
but couldn't this be an important detail?

25:20.687 --> 25:21.688
Hey, tell you what.

25:21.771 --> 25:24.774
If you wanna hang out around here
and play with dog toys, go for it.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.027
I'm going after the fugitive.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.696
-You shouldn't scratch, bro.
-Shut up, dude.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.031
-Copy that.
-Okay?

25:31.114 --> 25:32.115
Let's move out.

25:38.163 --> 25:41.249
Well, this explains why Hooch
was jumping out of your car.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.751
He smelled another dog.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.544
Yeah, I just wish it was more of a clue.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.421
Well, it's not not a clue.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.507
It's a military-grade KONG. Extra tough.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.259
Military dogs use them,

25:51.343 --> 25:54.888
'cause they chew so hard and it's
really hard to replace toys in the field.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.599
So, could a military dog be with him?

25:57.682 --> 26:01.061
Sure. Yeah. They let army dogs retire
with their handlers now.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.772
It's so much better for the dog
and the soldier

26:03.855 --> 26:05.148
'cause they bond in combat.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.733
Why would he risk going home
to get his dog

26:06.816 --> 26:08.526
when he was on the run from the police?

26:09.152 --> 26:11.571
-I would never leave Angel behind.
-

26:11.654 --> 26:15.158
Not even if I was being chased
by cops or dinosaurs or ghosts.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.285
Uh, I wanna broach that. I--

26:18.620 --> 26:19.871
Oh, no.

26:19.954 --> 26:21.414
Is something wrong?

26:21.915 --> 26:23.124
No.

26:24.125 --> 26:27.420
Sort of. I have this thing,
and I have to ballroom dance.

26:27.504 --> 26:31.383
And I don't even know the difference
between the American waltz or Vietnamese.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.678
I think you mean Viennese.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.929
Oh.

26:36.012 --> 26:39.015
Oh, that's why my Google searches
only found a dance studio in Hanoi.

26:40.809 --> 26:41.893
Yeah, the Viennese waltz

26:41.976 --> 26:43.520
-is just a faster tempo.
-

26:43.603 --> 26:45.438
Hmm.
-More change steps and turns.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.482
Most people do the American waltz.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.361
I could teach you
if that would be helpful.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.864
Actually, a lot of the staff
are out doing field exercises now,

26:54.948 --> 26:56.491
so there's-- there's even space.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.451
Wait. You know how to waltz?

26:58.535 --> 27:01.246
When Curtis was little, his favorite show
was Dancing With The Stars,

27:01.329 --> 27:03.540
and our mom thought if he took lessons,

27:03.623 --> 27:05.291
maybe it would help him
come out of his shell.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.334
It did.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.378
We even won some competitions.

27:08.461 --> 27:12.173
Okay. So, dog whisperer, ballroom champ…

27:12.257 --> 27:13.758
What other secrets are you hiding?

27:15.093 --> 27:18.680
Nothing. That's 100% of my secrets, Scott.

27:18.763 --> 27:22.434
I tried to keep that one from you,
but you're a detective.

27:22.517 --> 27:23.935
So, dancing?

27:24.728 --> 27:26.146
Okay.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.481
Dancing, Hooch? Dancing.

27:28.565 --> 27:30.984
One, two, three. One, two, three.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.235
Great. And now the arms.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.529
Great. And then just like…

27:35.071 --> 27:36.114
Two, three.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.158
-Oh!
-Geez! I'm so sorry.

27:38.241 --> 27:40.702
In waltzing, is there a part
where it's kind of, like, interpretive?

27:40.785 --> 27:41.786
No.

27:41.870 --> 27:42.912
Okay, now I'm gonna spin.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.330
One, two, three. One, two.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.417
What?

27:48.084 --> 27:50.253
-You're ready for the next thing.
-Yeah. It's my turn to spin.

27:50.337 --> 27:52.380
-Is that wrong?

27:52.464 --> 27:54.466
You don't spin.
- Doesn't seem fair.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.217
-Okay, fine.
-Thank you.

27:56.301 --> 27:57.469
Slower.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.179
Okay, good. Now turn around.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.222
-Sorry.
-

28:01.306 --> 28:03.558
One, two, three. One, two--

28:03.641 --> 28:05.268
-Oh!
-Sorry. I did it again, right?

28:05.352 --> 28:08.063
Okay, now you don't count. Spin.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.481
All right. Oh!

28:09.564 --> 28:12.150
-I'm sorry.
- No, it's… It's good.

28:21.785 --> 28:22.786
Spin.

28:25.663 --> 28:26.998
I can't believe I'm doing this.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.708
You're doing so great.

28:29.459 --> 28:30.960
Are you ready to try the dip?

28:31.044 --> 28:35.215
Yeah, I-- Maybe you should put on
one of those dog bite suits first.

28:36.383 --> 28:38.968
Brooke's a fancy woman.
She's gonna expect a dip.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.929
-Go big or go home.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.723
Okay. I'll go big. What do I do?

28:44.265 --> 28:46.601
All right, let's start here.
She'll spin out.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.270
Spin in.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.355
Hold me tight.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.607
Brooke. Hold Brooke tight.

28:52.691 --> 28:56.236
Yep. So she knows you won't drop her,
and then look into her eyes…

28:58.530 --> 28:59.781
and then lower her.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.501
-Do you need to get that or…
-Yeah.

29:13.128 --> 29:14.129
-You know what?
-What?

29:14.212 --> 29:16.506
I think it might be faster
if I just kinda let you down.

29:16.589 --> 29:17.590
-Oh, go down?
-Yeah. Yeah.

29:17.674 --> 29:18.675
Okay. Yeah.

29:18.758 --> 29:19.884
-There you go.
-Oh.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.177
-You're on the ground now.
-Cool.

29:21.261 --> 29:22.762
-We'll work on that part.
-Okay.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.390
-It's my sister.
-Oh, cool.

29:25.473 --> 29:27.017
-Sorry.
-Yeah. I gotta go work.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.686
-Dog work. Dog's work's never done.
- Okay. Okay.

29:29.769 --> 29:30.979
-Yep.
- I--

29:31.646 --> 29:32.731
I'll be--

29:32.814 --> 29:33.940
Hi. Hi.

29:34.024 --> 29:36.943
Hey, Scott. Sorry to bother you.
Are you in the middle of something?

29:39.195 --> 29:40.196
I'm not sure.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.615
I know you're really mad at me
about the whole David thing.

29:42.699 --> 29:43.700
The David thing?

29:43.783 --> 29:45.910
I think you mean
the "breaking into an old friend's office

29:45.994 --> 29:47.120
so you can spy on him" thing.

29:47.203 --> 29:50.373
Listen to me. I was just talking to Mom,
just now, and get this.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.625
You know how Mom and David
have dinner every Saturday night

29:52.709 --> 29:53.710
at Crescent Burger?

29:53.793 --> 29:57.797
Well, he just called and said that they
should have dinner at her place tomorrow

29:57.881 --> 29:58.882
out of the blue.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.259
Huh. That's weird.

30:01.343 --> 30:02.427
Uh, ya think?

30:03.094 --> 30:05.513
He's threatening my ex,
investigating Dad and now this?

30:05.597 --> 30:07.974
We have to be at that dinner, Scott.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.267
You know I'm right.

30:09.351 --> 30:10.643
Okay.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.187
You may be somewhat right.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.105
Great. I will take it. Thank you.

30:14.189 --> 30:15.648
Bye.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.032
Mom. Do you think I could crash
your dinner with David tomorrow?

30:24.115 --> 30:25.450
I haven't seen him in a while.

30:26.201 --> 30:28.912
Yeah. I don't see why not.
I bet he'd love it.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.580
Aw, great. Fun.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.713
Two, three.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.758
One.

30:41.841 --> 30:42.926
You're improving.

30:43.593 --> 30:44.719
Very nice.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.638
Thanks.

30:47.889 --> 30:51.434
Erica taught me some stuff.
You know, turns out she's a great dancer.

30:51.518 --> 30:54.479
Erica teaches dance too? Hmm.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.691
What are you doing here?
Weren't you up in a tree all night?

30:58.483 --> 30:59.859
When do you sleep?

30:59.943 --> 31:01.361
When the job's done.

31:02.612 --> 31:04.614
Whoa. You did all this research?

31:06.783 --> 31:07.867
Well, any answers?

31:08.368 --> 31:09.619
Nah, just questions.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.497
You know,
Jackson did six combat deployments,

31:12.580 --> 31:14.582
trained in survival and special tactics.

31:14.666 --> 31:18.044
If he wanted those booby traps
to kill you, why aren't you dead?

31:18.128 --> 31:20.130
Huh. That's a dark question.

31:20.213 --> 31:24.634
Also, the landlord said the assault
happened over a refusal to pay rent.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.886
I checked Jackson's financial records.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.015
He paid every bill on time
going back to 2007.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.267
We're missing something.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.686
Well, one thing we're missing is this.

31:35.395 --> 31:37.355
Found it freshly buried
near one of the booby traps.

31:37.439 --> 31:38.565
-His dog is with him.
-Hmm.

31:39.357 --> 31:40.650
-Dog?
- Yeah.

31:40.734 --> 31:44.029
Well, the landlord didn't mention a dog
in the report he filed to the police.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.113
Huh.

31:45.196 --> 31:46.906
Sounds like we should talk
to that landlord.

31:48.241 --> 31:49.242
Nice job, Turner.

31:50.201 --> 31:52.328
I love watching a baby bird
stretch its wings.

31:52.912 --> 31:55.582
All right. I-I'm not exactly a baby bird.

31:55.665 --> 31:58.668
-You know, I've been working this case.
-No, no. I wasn't talking about you.

31:58.752 --> 32:01.546
I saw a baby bird stretch its wings
in the tree last night.

32:02.714 --> 32:03.882
It's a beautiful thing.

32:04.591 --> 32:05.884
Come on. Let's go.

32:10.847 --> 32:12.640
I don't know why we gotta
go over this again.

32:12.724 --> 32:15.101
-I told everything to the cops already.
-It won't take long.

32:15.185 --> 32:17.312
It's just one question actually.

32:17.395 --> 32:19.856
Why didn't you mention
Jackson's dog to the police

32:19.939 --> 32:21.441
when you reported him for assault?

32:21.524 --> 32:23.151
I don't know. It didn't seem important.

32:23.234 --> 32:24.235
It is.

32:24.319 --> 32:26.780
Why don't you tell us what happened,
including the dog?

32:26.863 --> 32:29.240
Also, making a false statement
to the US Marshals

32:29.324 --> 32:30.992
can get you five years
in a federal prison.

32:31.076 --> 32:33.328
Just, you know, FYI.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.454
XYZ.

32:35.997 --> 32:39.584
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember now.
Yeah, it wasn't the rent, uh.

32:39.668 --> 32:44.297
The building changed to no pets allowed.
Dude wouldn't give up his dog.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.925
I went to evict him,
and he just attacked me.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.843
He just attacked you?

32:50.053 --> 32:54.140
Well, yeah. Well, I might have, you know,
pushed his dog with my foot a little.

32:54.224 --> 32:56.017
-

32:58.353 --> 33:00.438
So, you kicked his dog, and he hit you?

33:00.522 --> 33:02.065
Hey, hey. I'm the victim here.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.775
Show us Jackson's apartment.

33:26.131 --> 33:28.133
Yo. Yo, check this out.

33:28.717 --> 33:32.971
Jackson's dog, Trooper, saved
his whole unit from a sniper in Iraq.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.597
This cabin.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.850
Does it look like
an old lady's face to you?

33:36.933 --> 33:38.977
What? Are you good?

33:39.060 --> 33:42.647
The scouts told me about this cabin
that looks like an old lady's face

33:42.731 --> 33:44.482
nearby where the search started.

33:44.566 --> 33:45.942
That's probably where he's going.

33:46.526 --> 33:48.194
Which would mean that all the booby traps,

33:48.278 --> 33:51.906
the whole chase was to drive us to the
other side of the woods away from there.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.576
Well, it looks more and more like
Jackson was just a war hero

33:54.659 --> 33:56.619
who wanted to be left alone with his dog.

33:58.163 --> 33:59.998
Trent's taking this personally.

34:00.081 --> 34:02.709
If he gets to Jackson before we do,
it could be really bad.

34:02.792 --> 34:04.294
We better get there before he does.

34:04.377 --> 34:06.588
But how? I mean, we gotta tell
Trent what happened.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.715
-He's the deputy in charge.
-Yeah, no problem.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.600
This is the Big Dog.
I'm out saving the world.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.310
-Leave a message.
-

34:20.393 --> 34:23.855
Hey, Trent. It's Xavier.
We know where Jackson is hiding.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.023
Call me.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.192
Trent never answers my calls.

34:29.819 --> 34:31.071
Oh, he's very good.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.709
It's about five miles up this road.

34:45.585 --> 34:47.128
Let's get stoked.

34:50.924 --> 34:55.053
Uh, it's just, um, my dance thing's
coming up. I'm just practicing.

34:55.762 --> 34:56.763
I like it.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.724
I do push-ups to paso doble.

35:00.558 --> 35:01.559
Oh.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.987
Okay. Stay quiet.

35:13.780 --> 35:14.948
Head on a swivel.

35:15.448 --> 35:18.118
I knew a lot of these special forces
guys in Iraq.

35:18.618 --> 35:20.578
The good ones are unstoppable,

35:20.662 --> 35:23.623
and I'm pretty sure
that Jackson is very, very good.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.709
That's not encouraging.

35:29.254 --> 35:32.257
Those kids were right.
Cabin looks like an old lady's face.

35:32.340 --> 35:36.428
The windows are like the eyes,
and the door, a little, cute nose.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.013
And the steps is her mouth.

35:38.722 --> 35:40.098
Moss is like the eyebrows.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.183
Yeah, I get it. But how d--

35:42.267 --> 35:43.518
Drop your weapon.

35:43.601 --> 35:44.602
Get on the ground now.

35:44.686 --> 35:45.687
I'm not gonna do that.

35:45.770 --> 35:48.398
Just calm down.
We know what happened with your landlord.

35:48.481 --> 35:49.649
We know about Trooper.

35:49.733 --> 35:50.942
What do you know about Trooper?

35:55.822 --> 35:57.240
We just want to talk.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.909
What is there to talk about?
Someone evicts me and kicks my dog.

35:59.993 --> 36:01.494
I'm just supposed to let it go?

36:01.578 --> 36:03.455
I know it's hard, brother,
but you're making it worse.

36:03.538 --> 36:05.165
It can't get any worse. Trooper's sick!

36:05.832 --> 36:08.626
And I'm not gonna abandon him.
He saved my life. I owe him.

36:08.710 --> 36:10.086
-I understand, but you g--
-

36:11.171 --> 36:13.840
You hear those cars?
That's Trent coming up the road.

36:13.923 --> 36:15.675
Listen. You gotta come with us.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.719
I'm not going anywhere,
and neither is my dog.

36:17.802 --> 36:18.928
Leave us alone!

36:20.013 --> 36:21.806
All right, boy. Inside.

36:27.145 --> 36:29.522
Five more minutes,
we would have talked that guy down.

36:32.734 --> 36:33.902
Come on, boy.

36:51.419 --> 36:54.047
Turner? X? What are you doing here?

36:54.130 --> 36:56.508
You can't come at him like this.
It's not gonna end well.

36:56.591 --> 36:59.302
Whose side are you on, Turner?
I say how this is gonna go.

36:59.386 --> 37:03.932
Either he comes out and surrenders now,
or we kick the door down and drag him out.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.434
He's in the middle
of a mental health crisis, Trent.

37:06.518 --> 37:07.727
We need to talk to him.

37:07.811 --> 37:08.937
The time for talking's over.

37:11.981 --> 37:12.982
Yep.

37:14.067 --> 37:16.194
-Time to speak up is--
-Is the time to speak up.

37:17.195 --> 37:20.198
Trent! Don't do this. This is a mistake!

37:20.281 --> 37:23.034
What do you think you're doing, Turner?
I'm arresting that psycho.

37:23.118 --> 37:26.329
He's not a psycho. He's a human being,
and I'm gonna talk to him.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.248
Hey, Stop! Stop right there!

37:28.331 --> 37:29.916
Stand down! Turner!

37:30.000 --> 37:32.460
-Hooch. Hooch, come here.
- Move, move!

37:34.254 --> 37:35.422
Sergeant Jackson?

37:36.297 --> 37:39.134
I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed. I'm approaching.

37:41.636 --> 37:43.638
We're gonna talk man-to-man.

37:46.683 --> 37:48.435
And dog-to-dog.

37:58.695 --> 37:59.988
What do you want?

38:00.613 --> 38:04.909
Sergeant Jackson, I know you've
made sacrifices for our country,

38:05.493 --> 38:08.621
and I'm not gonna insult you and pretend
that I know what you're going through.

38:10.123 --> 38:12.751
But I know what it means to love a dog.

38:13.877 --> 38:16.254
And there are people out there
that wanna come in here,

38:16.338 --> 38:18.423
and they wanna take you out by force.

38:19.591 --> 38:23.345
I wanna help. But I need you to help me.

38:23.970 --> 38:25.388
I told you I'm not leaving.

38:30.852 --> 38:33.605
Be ready.
We may have to save that idiot, Turner.

38:36.358 --> 38:39.402
You don't get it.
If I go to jail, my dog's got no one.

38:39.986 --> 38:42.864
If I go away,
they'll put him down the next day.

38:43.740 --> 38:47.452
And I'm not gonna abandon my dog.
Not when he needs me the most.

38:47.535 --> 38:49.788
But you can't take care of him out here.

38:49.871 --> 38:51.831
And we both know that.

38:51.915 --> 38:54.542
He's 12 years old,
and he needs medicine twice a day.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.753
Who's gonna take care of a dog like that?

38:59.339 --> 39:00.548
Hey, Trooper.

39:05.637 --> 39:06.638
I will.

39:07.555 --> 39:10.141
I'll get him into
the Federal K-9 Training Facility.

39:11.393 --> 39:14.229
They'll give Trooper the care he needs.
I promise you that.

39:17.357 --> 39:19.192
Hostage rescue SWAT in place.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.572
Come on, baby bird.

39:26.491 --> 39:27.659
We're coming out!

39:28.660 --> 39:30.787
Stand down! It's okay!

39:32.664 --> 39:33.873
Hold your fire.

39:43.049 --> 39:45.927
It's gonna be all right, man.
You did the right thing.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.512
- Suspect in custody.

39:51.474 --> 39:52.475
All right, buddy.

39:52.559 --> 39:56.104
We're just gonna go in there,
heads held high, take our lumps, right?

39:56.187 --> 39:57.939
Some people might think
we did the wrong thing,

39:58.023 --> 39:59.774
but we're just not gonna listen.

40:01.109 --> 40:04.696
Not that you shouldn't listen when people
think you did the wrong thing, right?

40:04.779 --> 40:05.780
You should.

40:05.864 --> 40:07.991
Especially when you chew legs
off chairs in the kitchen.

40:08.074 --> 40:10.410
-That's different.
- Am I interrupting something?

40:10.493 --> 40:13.580
Uh, no. I'm just preparing Hooch.

40:13.663 --> 40:14.706
Chief wants to see us,

40:14.789 --> 40:17.500
and I think we're gonna be
in a lot of trouble about what went down.

40:18.084 --> 40:20.211
-Maybe. Maybe not.
-What do you mean?

40:20.295 --> 40:23.131
Well, I don't wanna read
too much into this,

40:23.214 --> 40:25.342
but I saw Trent
try and high-five the chief.

40:25.425 --> 40:26.926
Chief just left him hanging.

40:28.136 --> 40:30.138
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

40:30.221 --> 40:31.639
That's very interesting.

40:31.723 --> 40:35.143
Mm-hmm.
I heard something else interesting.

40:35.226 --> 40:38.271
I heard you got some dance lessons
from Erica.

40:38.355 --> 40:39.522
A little cha-cha-cha.

40:39.606 --> 40:40.565
-Nope.
-Uh-huh.

40:40.648 --> 40:42.108
I need details, Turner.

40:43.151 --> 40:45.695
I would love to,
but I just have this meeting to go to.

40:45.779 --> 40:48.531
-So I cannot give you the details.
-You-- Scott. Turner.

40:51.284 --> 40:52.410
These two broke protocol.

40:52.494 --> 40:54.746
Agency policy states that as DIC,

40:54.829 --> 40:58.291
I should have been informed the moment
they knew the fugitive's location.

40:58.375 --> 40:59.542
Check your voice mail.

41:01.586 --> 41:02.796
'Kay.

41:05.715 --> 41:09.010
Hi. This is Maui Wowie spray tan
salon confirming your appointment.

41:09.094 --> 41:10.095
Nope.

41:10.178 --> 41:11.888
That was a friend making a joke.

41:11.971 --> 41:16.101
Hey, Trent. It's Xavier.
We know where Jackson's hiding. Call me.

41:17.310 --> 41:20.313
Well, last I checked, it's agency policy
to communicate with your team.

41:20.397 --> 41:21.481
Okay, so I missed a call.

41:21.564 --> 41:24.192
But that doesn't change the fact
that Turner disobeyed a direct order

41:24.275 --> 41:25.443
and went into the cabin.

41:25.527 --> 41:27.946
-Enough. Turner saved a guy's life.
-And a dog's.

41:28.029 --> 41:31.658
Okay, so that's it? He hijacks
my operation and just walks away?

41:31.741 --> 41:35.161
No. Turner took over so he can handle
the after-action paperwork.

41:35.245 --> 41:36.287
I'm good with that.

41:37.163 --> 41:38.456
Oh, and another thing.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.542
Xavier has 15 years with the Service.

41:40.625 --> 41:43.920
How'd he end up on a roadblock duty
guarding cars?

41:46.506 --> 41:48.383
Well, Chief, I'm glad you asked.

41:48.466 --> 41:53.346
As DIC, I thought that would be
a good use of his skills.

41:53.430 --> 41:54.514
Is that right?

41:54.597 --> 41:57.392
Well, something just came in
that might be a good use of your skills.

41:57.976 --> 42:00.186
There's a fugitive checkpoint
up in Humboldt County

42:00.270 --> 42:01.438
that could use an extra body.

42:10.363 --> 42:11.489
Bring a good raincoat.

42:19.247 --> 42:21.249
-How's Trooper doing?
-So good.

42:21.332 --> 42:22.334
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

42:22.417 --> 42:23.418
Sit.

42:23.501 --> 42:27.839
I had one of the vets check him out,
and he is old, but I think I can help him.

42:27.922 --> 42:31.134
And he's gonna help us train the puppies.
So, win-win.

42:31.217 --> 42:32.344
-Ah, that's great.
-Yeah.

42:33.053 --> 42:34.095
He's a good dog.

42:35.138 --> 42:36.514
It's funny.

42:36.598 --> 42:40.769
Um, when we met,
I didn't think you were even a dog person.

42:41.436 --> 42:42.937
But wow.

42:43.021 --> 42:44.856
You are such a dog person.

42:46.441 --> 42:48.735
I don't know. I'm getting there.

42:53.406 --> 42:57.035
Oh, shoot. I gotta go.
The event's tonight.

42:57.118 --> 43:00.789
I gotta go home and dog-proof my place
for Hooch to be there alone.

43:00.872 --> 43:03.333
Last time, I walked in on him wearing
my favorite turtleneck.

43:03.416 --> 43:04.709
Cute.

43:04.793 --> 43:06.044
Leave him here.

43:06.127 --> 43:07.128
-No.
-Yeah.

43:07.212 --> 43:08.213
No. That's not--

43:08.296 --> 43:10.256
Come on. Look how happy they are.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.341
I'll just watch him.

43:11.424 --> 43:13.677
-Really?
-Go. Get outta here.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.970
You're amazing. Thank you. That's awesome.

43:16.054 --> 43:17.138
Yeah.

43:18.848 --> 43:20.058
-Scott.
-Yep?

43:21.184 --> 43:22.185
Don't dip too far.

43:22.268 --> 43:23.853
-I won't.
- Okay.

43:23.937 --> 43:24.938
Thanks.

43:31.695 --> 43:35.115
So, Laura, it's a nice surprise,
you joining us for dinner.

43:35.198 --> 43:37.701
Yes, well,
it's always great to see old friends,

43:37.784 --> 43:39.452
and I know you've been busy…

43:39.994 --> 43:41.413
with things.

43:41.496 --> 43:45.917
I think the Guacamole Festival
has everyone a little crazy.

43:46.001 --> 43:48.920
The same weekend
as the Sausalito Salsa Fest.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.339
-They're trying to steal our thunder.
-

43:51.423 --> 43:52.757
Sausalito.

43:52.841 --> 43:55.719
They pretend they're a quaint,
small town, but really, they're not.

43:55.802 --> 43:58.763
It's kinda like
a wolf in sheep's clothing.

44:00.015 --> 44:01.016
I guess.

44:01.599 --> 44:04.811
Anyway, this GuacFest will not be
the same without your dad.

44:06.146 --> 44:07.147
I miss him a lot.

44:08.148 --> 44:09.190
I think we all do.

44:15.697 --> 44:18.825
-Whoa.
-Yeah. The foundation really goes all out.

44:19.993 --> 44:21.703
I mean, it's no Guacamole Fest.

44:21.786 --> 44:23.788
True.

44:25.874 --> 44:26.875
Oh, hi!

44:26.958 --> 44:28.043
Hi.

44:28.126 --> 44:31.004
Mom, Dad, this is Scott,
who I was telling you about,

44:31.087 --> 44:32.088
from the Marshals.

44:32.172 --> 44:33.173
Oh, good for you.

44:33.256 --> 44:35.342
Rolling your sleeves up.
Making a difference, son.

44:35.425 --> 44:36.760
Trying to, sir.

44:36.843 --> 44:37.927
Just like our dear Brooke.

44:38.011 --> 44:41.473
Although, I keep trying to get her to join
my firm and make some real money.

44:42.974 --> 44:45.310
Behave, Martin.
-I'm joking. He knows I'm joking.

44:45.393 --> 44:46.394
Right?

44:47.062 --> 44:48.813
Oh. Shall we dance?

44:52.484 --> 44:55.153
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

44:55.236 --> 44:58.782
Emily, where did you put
Scott Sr.'s old things?

44:58.865 --> 45:00.909
I thought I might look for some keepsakes.

45:01.493 --> 45:05.121
That's so sweet. You're welcome to look
through the boxes in the basement.

45:05.205 --> 45:06.206
Ah. Okay.

45:26.976 --> 45:29.062
You are full of surprises.

45:29.145 --> 45:31.022
A friend taught me.

46:22.198 --> 46:25.910
Hey there, Laura. I was just looking
for some old photos of your dad.

46:26.578 --> 46:27.912
-Were you?
- Yeah.

46:27.996 --> 46:30.373
I was gonna use one
for the Memorial Cooking Award.

46:30.457 --> 46:32.709
And you thought that that would be
in a box marked "Case Files"?

46:35.003 --> 46:37.714
My eyes must be getting old.
I must have pulled the wrong box.

46:37.797 --> 46:39.090
It's not the wrong box.

46:39.174 --> 46:42.260
I know you've been following Dad's cases.
I saw the notes in your office.

46:43.219 --> 46:44.637
You were snooping in my office?

46:44.721 --> 46:47.182
You're one to talk.
What are you doing down here?

46:50.477 --> 46:53.813
Your dad was always riled
about developers ruining the town.

46:55.023 --> 46:57.067
Just before he passed, he called me,
wanted to meet.

46:57.150 --> 46:58.151
About what?

46:59.944 --> 47:01.654
He said it was something big.

47:01.738 --> 47:04.282
I thought it was more of the same,
so I put it off.

47:06.326 --> 47:08.745
He died before I had the chance
to talk with him.

47:09.245 --> 47:10.413
I felt awful.

47:12.332 --> 47:15.418
You've been trying to figure out
what he was doing?

47:18.421 --> 47:21.508
I should have told you guys,
but you know how your mother is.

47:21.591 --> 47:23.593
-It would have broke her heart.
-This is crazy.

47:23.677 --> 47:26.513
Scott and I have been trying to
investigate the same exact thing.

47:27.889 --> 47:31.226
Course you have.
You're Scott Turner's kids.

47:33.019 --> 47:35.313
So, what did you find?

47:37.232 --> 47:39.234
That road where he had the heart attack…

47:40.318 --> 47:41.945
Your father was watching something.

47:42.529 --> 47:43.905
Do you know what?

47:47.158 --> 47:48.702
I wanted to crack his last case.

47:50.745 --> 47:54.708
But it's been so long since I was a cop
and he was my partner.

48:02.048 --> 48:03.508
It's okay, David.

48:06.302 --> 48:07.679
We'll figure this out.

48:08.263 --> 48:09.764
We'll figure this out together.

48:15.395 --> 48:17.814
Ah, someone's been to cotillion.

48:18.940 --> 48:20.567
Handsome looking pair out there.

48:21.026 --> 48:23.987
So what style of waltz do you like, Scott?

48:24.696 --> 48:27.949
Well, sir,
I like my waltzes like I like my cars.

48:28.033 --> 48:29.701
American and smooth.

48:32.620 --> 48:34.247
Scott, come join me later.

48:34.330 --> 48:36.458
We'll have a scotch and cigar
with Buzz Aldrin.

48:36.541 --> 48:39.669
-Okay, you two. Stop monopolizing my date.
- Hmm.

48:39.753 --> 48:41.546
All right, sweetie. Come on.

48:42.922 --> 48:44.341
-You did good.
-
