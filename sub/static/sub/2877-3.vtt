WEBVTT

00:05.130 --> 00:07.715
- So you and Rach tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

00:07.924 --> 00:10.384
Yeah, it's actually
our first official date.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.137
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?

00:13.304 --> 00:17.016
Nah. No. This is the part
I'm actually good at, ha, ha.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.812
What must it be like not to be
crippled by fear and self-loathing?

00:22.939 --> 00:24.648
It's okay.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.027
How can you be so confident?

00:28.194 --> 00:31.030
Well, I know exactly
what I'm gonna do.

00:31.197 --> 00:35.451
- Really? Like, you have a routine?
- No. See, each woman is different.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.495
You have to appreciate
their uniqueness.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.874
- Really?
- No, I do six things.

00:42.042 --> 00:46.170
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.

00:46.337 --> 00:51.383
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.343
You mean like this?

00:58.016 --> 01:01.560
No, not like that. No, no.
No, like this:

01:05.355 --> 01:07.566
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.822
Ahem. More foosball?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.699
- And beer.
- Yeah.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.127
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.294
Hey, sweetie.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.133
Wow.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.305
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.

02:20.473 --> 02:24.476
No, no. Stop staring
at your sister's legs.

02:25.019 --> 02:28.147
I'm sorry, it's just...
How'd you get so tan?

02:28.314 --> 02:31.567
She went to one of those
spray-on tan places.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.611
You got a spray-on tan?

02:34.779 --> 02:37.322
Chandler gets pedicures.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.659
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.620
Why? Why?

02:44.789 --> 02:46.540
I can't believe that's sprayed on.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.793
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.

02:49.961 --> 02:54.339
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt
so you can really show it off.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.760
So do you get colors
or just French tips?

03:02.348 --> 03:06.268
- Here. Here's their card.
- Thanks.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.770
Hey, I know where this place is.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.231
It used to be an X-rated video...

03:14.652 --> 03:15.986
Florist.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.074
Hey.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.326
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey, Phoebe.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.037
Ugh, you won't believe
who moved back to town.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.580
- I know. Amanda.
- Ugh.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.000
- She called me too. She's the worst.
- Who's Amanda?

03:30.168 --> 03:32.920
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.

03:33.087 --> 03:36.381
Then she moved to England
and picked up this fake British accent.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.175
On the machine, this is her message:

03:38.343 --> 03:43.096
"Um, Monica,
darling, it's Amanda calling."

03:43.890 --> 03:46.892
Are you trying to do a British accent?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.939
Chandler gets pedicures.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.361
Just so I know, how many more
of those can I expect?

03:57.904 --> 03:59.988
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?

04:00.156 --> 04:03.033
"Oh, so sorry
to catch you on your mobile."

04:04.535 --> 04:09.081
If you didn't wanna get me on my mobile,
then don't call me on my mobile.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.126
And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.753
Oh, I know.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.798
"Uh, I slept with Billy Joel."

04:18.548 --> 04:20.759
All right, who hasn't?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.553
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.389
Oh, let's just cut her out.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.308
- What?
- Cut her out of our lives.

04:28.476 --> 04:32.020
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.

04:32.188 --> 04:36.275
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.

04:36.442 --> 04:40.195
- Have you ever done that?
- No. Had it done to me, though.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.614
Feels good.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.372
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.794
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.213
Well, uh, I like how you look.
What are you?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.008
- Puerto Rican.
- Two. I think a two.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.220
You'll face the red light.

05:05.388 --> 05:08.974
When the light's on, the spraying's
about to start, so close your eyes.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.935
When the spraying stops,
count to five...

05:12.103 --> 05:16.148
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?

05:16.316 --> 05:20.652
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.

05:20.820 --> 05:25.407
- Wow, you catch on quick.
- Well, I have a Ph.D., so...

05:47.722 --> 05:50.766
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi, three...

05:52.018 --> 05:57.397
Wait, wait!
I'm not... I'm not finished counting.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.862
You sprayed my front twice.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.282
- You never turned?
- No. I barely got to "three Mississippi."

06:07.450 --> 06:11.078
Mississippi? I said count to five.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.497
Mississippi-lessly?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.084
Well, how bad is it?

06:17.251 --> 06:20.504
Not that bad yet. But it gets
darker for the next four hours.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.214
So how dark will it get?

06:22.423 --> 06:24.299
Oh, you got sprayed
with two twos and...

06:24.509 --> 06:26.426
I'm a four?

06:27.261 --> 06:30.555
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.516
Really?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.811
- You might wanna get back in there.
- Oh, okay.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.823
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.785
How do I know
when it's gonna start? Hello?

06:53.121 --> 06:54.996
My eyes!

07:08.094 --> 07:10.345
The same thing happened again!

07:10.513 --> 07:13.390
- You got two more twos?
- I'm an eight.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.313
Thanks for dinner.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.150
I thought you paid.

07:25.194 --> 07:28.363
Heh. Guess we won't be going
back there, ha, ha.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.783
- So...
- Yeah.

07:42.253 --> 07:46.047
Hey, what do you say we, uh, move this
onto the likes of the couch?

07:46.215 --> 07:49.134
I say cheesy line, but okay.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.865
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.951
- I don't know why I did that.
- Okay.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.455
Okay. Sorry.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.802
I'm sorry. Again, I don't know
what happened. I must be nervous.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.138
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.100
Okay.

08:39.268 --> 08:43.145
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.

08:43.313 --> 08:46.066
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:01.165 --> 09:04.376
Uh, was that good for you?

09:08.464 --> 09:10.882
No, don't get it.
Let the machine pick up.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.553
Oh, yeah, it could be Rachel asking
if someone could babysit again.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.433
- It could be Amanda.
- Oh, you're right. Oh.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.771
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.

09:26.148 --> 09:29.359
Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.237
I'm in the neighborhood,
hoping I could pop by your flat.

09:32.405 --> 09:36.575
You're from Yonkers.
Your last name is Buffamonteezi.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.661
Let's see.
So should you get this directly...

09:39.829 --> 09:41.329
...ring me back on my mobile.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.623
Okay, don't hold thy breath.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.837
Hello? Is someone on the line?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.505
Yes. I was looking for Monica.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.633
Hang on, she's right here.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.180
- Someone's on the phone for you.
- We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.602
I get pedicures.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.565
Hi, Amanda.

10:09.108 --> 10:14.613
Uh, actually, now is not a good time.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.532
- Dinner tomorrow night?
- No.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.118
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.787
Why? Why?
Why didn't you just say no?

10:22.955 --> 10:26.541
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.336
I got this uncontrollable need
to please people.

10:30.755 --> 10:34.841
Fine. Fine. You would not
hold up well under torture.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.344
- Oh, and you would?
- I did.

10:41.223 --> 10:44.017
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.478
It's just a little weird.
It's you, and it's me.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.855
- It'll just take some getting used to.
- Okay.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.317
Okay, well, uh,
how can we make it easier?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.488
Okay. Let's work from the top down.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.330
- Just work the bra, Joe.
- Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.668
- Okay, ha, ha.
- Okay.

11:23.599 --> 11:26.184
- Is this thing welded shut? Ha, ha.
- Okay.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.394
All right, turn around.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.896
- I gotta get a look at this thing.
- Oh.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.570
- Ow!
- Sorry.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.367
Well, this is romantic.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.120
I'm sorry. This has never
happened to me before.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.289
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.459
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...

11:51.627 --> 11:53.962
...and it popped open.

11:54.422 --> 11:58.591
- I blame your bra.
- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.929
Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.

12:03.097 --> 12:07.142
Okay, look, I'm really sorry
about that, Joey.

12:07.309 --> 12:13.857
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.486
No, I don't have another level.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.546
Hold on. There's something different.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.801
I went to that tanning place
your wife suggested.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.096
Was that place the sun?

12:46.682 --> 12:49.559
Oh, and it gets worse.

12:52.813 --> 12:57.108
Oh, my God, you can do a duet
of "Ebony and lvory" all by yourself.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.446
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.407
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.910
- How do you count to five?
- One, two, three...

13:07.077 --> 13:08.661
Damn it!

13:10.748 --> 13:12.582
- I know!
- Ha-ha-ha.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.296
Oh, what is up
with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.257
How was your date with Joey?

13:21.425 --> 13:26.012
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.849
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...

13:30.017 --> 13:31.684
...and I kept slapping it away.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.186
You didn't like that?

13:35.147 --> 13:37.982
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.901
He couldn't even undo my bra.

13:40.110 --> 13:43.488
Wow, really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.

13:46.867 --> 13:49.202
I do not know what's wrong with us.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.704
We've kissed before
and that's been great.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.957
But this time
it was leading somewhere...

13:54.124 --> 13:57.627
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.712
You guys have been friends forever.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.423
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.050
- Mm-hm.
- You couldn't stop laughing.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.677
- You got through that.
- Mm-hm.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.264
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.767
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.144
Hey, uh, Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:15.312 --> 14:18.940
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.700
Chandler, stop.
It's not going to pop open.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.451
You don't know.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.124
- Hi, Phoebe.
- Hey.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.543
- Is Amanda here yet?
- No.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.672
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.967
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.262
Oh, okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?

14:49.471 --> 14:53.141
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.436
- Are you kidding? I love it.
- Okay.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.231
- Hi. Ha, ha.
- Hi.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.859
Hello.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.195
- It's so nice to see you.
- Ha, ha.

15:06.363 --> 15:10.450
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.038
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.

15:15.247 --> 15:20.543
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.546
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.

15:23.714 --> 15:28.009
- Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's...
- Oh, smell my neck.

15:28.260 --> 15:33.473
It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.352
- Musty.
- Oh.

15:38.228 --> 15:42.482
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.318
I'm so happy you two
are friends again.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.738
- When were we not friends?
- Well, it was 1992.

15:48.906 --> 15:53.701
And I remember, because that was the
year I had sex with Evel Knievel. Ha, ha.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.829
Uh, we were friends in 1992.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.166
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...

16:00.334 --> 16:02.502
...and trying to avoid seeing her.

16:03.629 --> 16:07.757
- You were going to cut me out?
- Well, kind of.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.884
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, bugger.

16:10.052 --> 16:15.598
Should I not have said that? Unh!
I feel like a perfect arse.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.019
Well, in America, you're just an ass.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.401
Hello?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.486
Chandler, what's wrong?

16:28.779 --> 16:32.865
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

16:33.033 --> 16:36.202
Oh, I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.954
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.915
- Was Mike with him?
- Nope.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.878
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.548
- Got the champagne?
- Yes. Ready to power through.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.676
Excellent. Put it on ice,
the phone is off the hook...

16:51.844 --> 16:55.638
...and, in the interest
of powering through...

17:00.185 --> 17:03.479
Okay, sexy, sexy.

17:03.647 --> 17:06.523
Very sexy, sexy.

17:06.775 --> 17:10.153
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.406
- Oh, get over it, soldier, we gotta do this.
- Okay.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.909
- Okay. Ha, ha, you like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

17:17.077 --> 17:20.371
You like that?
Let's kick this into high gear, huh?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.080
Oh. Oh.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.208
Yeah, baby.
I'll show you how we do it.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.710
No, no, no.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.627
You kneed me in my misters.

17:27.796 --> 17:32.633
What? Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.636
Joey? Are you okay?

17:40.225 --> 17:42.310
Soldier down.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.316
We are not friends
with Phoebe anymore.

17:48.817 --> 17:53.154
If she asks,
I protested a little, but okay.

17:54.156 --> 17:58.117
Oh, Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?

17:58.327 --> 18:03.998
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Wow. My flat is twice this size.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.293
Please, Monica, in the hall?

18:09.588 --> 18:13.257
Ooh, that accident
must have been terrible.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.803
You look positively ghastly.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.140
Well, aren't you a treat.

18:21.975 --> 18:25.436
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?

18:25.604 --> 18:27.897
It was right after
we were living together...

18:28.065 --> 18:29.941
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

18:30.109 --> 18:33.903
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.031
Well, I'm still all those things.

18:37.407 --> 18:42.036
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.833
I am scrappy.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.462
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.256
Of all the people I've cut out...

18:53.423 --> 18:56.717
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.930
That's because I'm scrappy.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.475
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

19:04.643 --> 19:07.145
...because I don't know what
I would do without you.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.355
I don't know what
I would do without you.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.731
Oh.

19:15.362 --> 19:19.198
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.

19:19.366 --> 19:23.411
- We should do the same for Amanda.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:31.545 --> 19:35.047
Can you believe it? I've never had
any professional dance training.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.057
Let me explain how this works.
Go in the booth and...

19:45.225 --> 19:49.979
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Glenda. Okay? Ha, ha.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.899
Does it look like this is
my first time, huh?

19:53.066 --> 19:58.404
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.698
Okay.

20:13.754 --> 20:19.467
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles.
Which one is it? Which one is it?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.804
Oh, son of a bitch!

20:30.103 --> 20:32.980
What is the matter with us?

20:33.190 --> 20:36.025
Well, I know what's
the matter with me.

20:36.193 --> 20:40.655
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...

20:41.198 --> 20:42.782
...difficult?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.369
I don't know.

20:46.536 --> 20:50.998
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.541
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:52.709 --> 20:56.921
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...

20:57.089 --> 21:01.801
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?

21:02.678 --> 21:05.638
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys...

21:05.806 --> 21:08.015
No, no, no. No, I mean...

21:08.183 --> 21:09.850
...sexually.

21:10.018 --> 21:14.981
Yeah, uh, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...

21:15.148 --> 21:17.400
...really wrong?

21:19.528 --> 21:22.363
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.948
If felt like, uh:

21:24.116 --> 21:26.826
"I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."

21:28.829 --> 21:32.373
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.

21:35.252 --> 21:39.880
Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.765
Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.600
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

21:51.810 --> 21:55.271
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.148
- Right, totally.
- Yeah. And so...

21:57.357 --> 22:01.193
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.904
If not, we'll just be a couple
that never has sex.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.698
That's a plan.

22:19.713 --> 22:24.383
- I did not see this coming.
- I know.

22:24.843 --> 22:29.388
I don't know, I don't get it. I mean,
I was so sure this is what I wanted.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.307
Mm-hm.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.434
Me too.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.858
Well, how come Monica and Chandler
could do it?

22:47.574 --> 22:50.951
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.038
Aw.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.458
- I bet you're right.
- Hmm.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.131
So...

23:07.636 --> 23:09.428
Yeah.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.349
I love you.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.310
Love you too.

23:17.896 --> 23:21.315
- All right, I'm going to bed.
- Yeah, me too.

23:23.693 --> 23:27.363
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere
for a while.

23:36.832 --> 23:40.751
- It's Chandler. Let me in.
- Go away.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.587
I don't wanna see anybody.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.715
I went to the tanning place
and the same thing happened to me.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.050
Let me in.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.802
Really?

23:50.095 --> 23:53.013
Did you count Mississippi-ly?

23:54.599 --> 23:55.933
You're not tan.

23:56.101 --> 24:02.148
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.
