00:01.978 --> 00:03.453
Oh, don't you give me that look.

00:04.405 --> 00:06.645
How should I know where
you put your teething ring?

00:06.646 --> 00:08.631
You have got to be a
little more responsible.

00:08.632 --> 00:09.541
Like me.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.722
Oh, here are my keys!

00:13.405 --> 00:14.476
Knock knock.

00:14.477 --> 00:17.313
Hey, I'm guessing that
someone is looking for this.

00:17.314 --> 00:18.540
Oh, thank you.

00:18.541 --> 00:20.557
Let's just say someone threw a huge tantrum

00:20.558 --> 00:22.059
and needed a cookie.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.571
Emma was kind of upset too.

00:25.135 --> 00:27.071
Well, lovely to see you,
but we have got to run.

00:27.072 --> 00:28.399
My sister Georgie just flew in,

00:28.400 --> 00:30.029
and Riley's meeting her for the first time.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.576
Oh, I actually just promised
her a round of super Emma.

00:32.577 --> 00:33.798
You got two seconds?

00:35.091 --> 00:36.413
<i>-  Yeah.
- All right.</i>

00:36.414 --> 00:38.167
Here we go, Emma.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.086
All right.

00:39.087 --> 00:40.509
Both: One, two, three.

00:40.510 --> 00:44.093
Super Emma! Whoo!

00:47.265 --> 00:49.661
I have to say, you almost
seem like a real family.

00:49.662 --> 00:51.870
I'm still a little surprised
the two of you never dated.

00:51.871 --> 00:53.895
What? No, never. Oh, gross.

00:53.896 --> 00:56.299
That would be like dating
my brother. Just disgusting.

00:57.097 --> 00:58.489
No. Blech.

00:59.981 --> 01:01.606
- Isn't it nap time?
- She just got up.

01:01.607 --> 01:02.900
Oh, great. Let's put her down.

01:04.321 --> 01:05.385
(Chuckles)

01:05.851 --> 01:07.316
<i>(Door closes)</i>

01:08.650 --> 01:09.654
<i>(Emma giggles)</i>

01:10.705 --> 01:12.276
You know, maybe it's just me

01:12.277 --> 01:14.143
but I'm starting to feel
like you never told Phillip

01:14.144 --> 01:16.630
- that we dated.
- No, I didn't tell him.

01:16.631 --> 01:18.450
At first, I thought he'd think it was weird

01:18.451 --> 01:20.810
since I spend like half my life over here,

01:20.811 --> 01:22.073
and now I feel like I've waited so long

01:22.074 --> 01:23.588
it seems like I'm trying to hide something.

01:23.589 --> 01:25.133
Okay, well I think it's pretty obvious

01:25.134 --> 01:26.391
what the problem is here.

01:26.826 --> 01:28.300
You still have feelings for me.

01:28.951 --> 01:29.904
Yeah, let's...

01:29.905 --> 01:32.029
let's call that the
opposite of the problem.

01:32.688 --> 01:33.529
Oh.

01:33.530 --> 01:34.947
"So you're saying
there's nothing about this

01:34.948 --> 01:36.176
you find appealing?"

01:36.177 --> 01:37.817
He said while peeling off his shirt.

01:37.818 --> 01:39.338
Oh my God. Stop it.

01:39.339 --> 01:40.775
<i>- (Knocks on door)
- Phillip: Everything all right in there?</i>

01:40.776 --> 01:42.031
Yeah, yeah. Everything's perfect.

01:42.542 --> 01:43.658
Everything's great.

01:43.659 --> 01:45.305
Hi. Bye, Emma.

01:46.213 --> 01:47.554
Hi.

01:51.989 --> 01:53.622
<i>She  so  likes me.</i>

01:54.612 --> 01:55.788
(Coos)

01:55.789 --> 01:57.954

02:09.776 --> 02:11.369
(exhales)

02:11.370 --> 02:13.330
Put a beer in your hand,
and you look like grandma

02:13.331 --> 02:14.935
waiting for the lotto numbers to come out.

02:16.890 --> 02:17.967
I can't help it.

02:18.319 --> 02:20.193
Contract negotiations make me nervous.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.020
Daniel Mellencamp Wheeler.

02:24.647 --> 02:26.516
Sit down, okay?

02:26.517 --> 02:29.051
Everything is going to be fine.

02:29.369 --> 02:31.273
(Sighs) How can you say that?

02:31.274 --> 02:32.967
We just got a new general manager,

02:32.968 --> 02:35.440
and lately my play has been lamentable.

02:36.667 --> 02:37.686
True.

02:37.687 --> 02:39.302
But that word of the day calendar

02:39.303 --> 02:41.100
is certainly paying for itself.

02:44.184 --> 02:45.273
Calm down.

02:45.642 --> 02:47.720
No one is going to be traded.

02:49.103 --> 02:49.975
(Crying)

02:49.976 --> 02:51.791
You said no one was getting traded.

02:56.723 --> 02:58.565
Well, except for maybe that guy.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.490
Okay, all right. I made it.

03:01.491 --> 03:04.240
I have about an hour before
anyone notices I stole the camera.

03:05.815 --> 03:07.093
And the cameraman.

03:08.265 --> 03:09.521
What is he doing here?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.682
Well, I asked Tucker to do a fake feature

03:11.683 --> 03:12.746
to create some fake buzz

03:12.747 --> 03:14.522
so that they can see that
you are the real deal.

03:15.736 --> 03:16.829
Yeah, I didn't follow it either,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.254
but she was like "or else."

03:19.827 --> 03:21.493
Sorry to keep you waiting, Danny.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.287
Don't be silly. We love waiting.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.906
And we love new contracts.

03:25.907 --> 03:26.962
Let's sign one.

03:27.798 --> 03:29.992
Bonnie Wheeler, mom-ager.

03:29.993 --> 03:31.615
I've heard great things about you.

03:31.616 --> 03:33.678
Oh, I've heard about you too. (Chuckles)

03:36.424 --> 03:38.662
And so the negotiation dance begins.

03:38.663 --> 03:40.980
First round goes to the hot ranger lady.

03:41.529 --> 03:43.100
I'm sorry, who are you,

03:43.101 --> 03:44.340
and why are you in my office?

03:44.341 --> 03:46.231
Tucker Dobbs, "The Mary Hart Show."

03:46.232 --> 03:49.576
We're doing a little piece
on the amazing Danny Wheeler.

03:49.577 --> 03:50.588
Fun.

03:50.589 --> 03:51.691
And if you want to branch out

03:51.692 --> 03:52.860
and cover the rest of the team,

03:52.861 --> 03:53.876
<i>give me a call.</i>

03:54.245 --> 03:56.009
I'll let you know which ones I'm keeping.

03:56.941 --> 03:58.317
Hey, you know, Valerie,

03:58.318 --> 04:00.009
maybe I could talk to Mary's people

04:00.010 --> 04:01.896
and ask if they could do a piece on you.

04:01.897 --> 04:04.877
First female GM in NHL history?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.798
Hey, where'd that barrier go?

04:06.799 --> 04:09.523
Oh, I know. Valerie broke it down.

04:11.259 --> 04:12.396
(Cellphone vibrating)

04:12.397 --> 04:13.982
Oh, yeah. That's gonna have to wait.

04:15.192 --> 04:17.072
I actually came out here to reschedule.

04:17.072 --> 04:19.166
Everyone is calling me
with trade proposals.

04:19.166 --> 04:22.251
It's amazing how many people
want to play with the Rangers.

04:22.252 --> 04:23.365
Well, I know I do.

04:23.366 --> 04:24.760
Both: Yeah, he does!

04:24.761 --> 04:26.826
- And he's been playing!
- You know he does, girl!

04:26.827 --> 04:28.425
- He knows where to park, so...
- Yeah.

04:29.112 --> 04:30.801
What is the matter with you?

04:30.802 --> 04:32.726
You know I can't have her on the show.

04:32.727 --> 04:34.010
I'm not allowed to book guests

04:34.011 --> 04:35.981
ever since the exploding turkey segment.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.498
Look. You don't have to.

04:39.499 --> 04:42.849
Just promise her anything until
Danny's contract is signed.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.725
Yeah, and then you can
just pull the plug on her

04:44.726 --> 04:46.158
like we did with Uncle Leon.

04:47.273 --> 04:48.882
Uncle Leon is dead?

04:50.046 --> 04:51.732
You told me he just ran away.

04:52.264 --> 04:54.639
You just need to focus, Danny, okay?

04:54.640 --> 04:56.617
We are getting you a new contract.

04:56.918 --> 04:59.453
We just need some way to butter Valerie up.

04:59.454 --> 05:00.615
Ooh.

05:00.616 --> 05:02.894
Tucker, you're the butter.

05:04.773 --> 05:06.177
Either that,

05:06.178 --> 05:07.801
or you're toast.

05:10.037 --> 05:12.128
And Phillip's last girlfriend Emily

05:12.129 --> 05:13.793
is just going mad trying to decide

05:13.794 --> 05:16.563
between medical school or that
modeling contract in Paris.

05:16.564 --> 05:18.485
Georgie, enough. I'm sure Riley doesn't

05:18.486 --> 05:20.633
need to hear about all
of my ex-girlfriends.

05:20.634 --> 05:22.712
Oh, no, it's fine. I'm fine.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.223
I'm just... I'm so fine.

05:25.149 --> 05:28.519
<i>I just didn't realize you had so so many.</i>

05:29.225 --> 05:31.437
Each more amazing than the last.

05:32.409 --> 05:33.357
But don't worry.

05:33.358 --> 05:35.015
You're nothing like any of them.

05:36.452 --> 05:38.587
Which is good because
I'm here and they're not.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.199
Anyway, enough about me.

05:41.116 --> 05:43.256
Phillip says so little about you.

05:43.915 --> 05:47.350
Well, he knows how much I
hate it when he brags about me.

05:47.351 --> 05:49.787
No, I'm just your average "Vogue" editor

05:49.788 --> 05:52.052
with degrees in Art History
and Marketing from Oxford.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.097
Okay, anyone else need a drink?

05:56.098 --> 05:57.380
No, just me? All right.

05:59.183 --> 06:01.902
I'm sorry. Do I have "hate
me" written on my forehead?

06:03.044 --> 06:05.643
She doesn't hate you.
And if she does, so what?

06:05.644 --> 06:06.772
You're not dating her.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.160
Though that is a very interesting image.

06:10.178 --> 06:11.743
Look, all you need is
someone to get her alone

06:11.744 --> 06:12.891
and talk you up.

06:12.892 --> 06:14.014
Which I'm willing to do.

06:14.691 --> 06:16.326
Even if it takes all night.

06:16.327 --> 06:18.623
So, Georgie expressed an interest

06:18.624 --> 06:20.231
in doing a little sightseeing.

06:20.232 --> 06:21.595
Oh. Okay, great.

06:21.596 --> 06:23.391
I'll just... I'll just close our tab.

06:24.254 --> 06:25.918
Our tab is now closed.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.167
Oh, it's all right.

06:28.168 --> 06:30.565
I'm sure you have better things to do.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.375
If not, I can suggest some.

06:33.386 --> 06:35.216
So, you must be the famous Georgie

06:35.217 --> 06:36.902
that Riley's been gushing about.

06:36.903 --> 06:38.472
She did leave one thing out, though.

06:38.473 --> 06:40.066
How beautiful your eyes are.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.313
I'm Ben.

06:41.726 --> 06:43.536
You seem like you know your way around.

06:43.951 --> 06:46.350
I don't suppose you'd like
to come sightseeing with us?

06:46.692 --> 06:48.368
Actually, I have to...

06:48.369 --> 06:49.683
find someone to cover for you?

06:49.684 --> 06:51.299
Hey, you. Cover for him.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.298
But I can't just...

06:52.299 --> 06:54.712
what, wear that? Oh my gosh,
don't be silly. You look so great.

06:54.713 --> 06:57.088
This is gonna be so fun. The
two of us with the two of you.

06:57.089 --> 06:58.494
Oh, Ben. Thank you so much.

06:58.495 --> 07:00.718
You're such a good friend.
All right, let's move, people.

07:03.191 --> 07:05.371
- Remember, be smooth.
- Like a criminal.

07:05.372 --> 07:06.981
(Both imitating Michael
Jackson) ï½♪ hee hee. ï½♪

07:07.684 --> 07:09.124
- then dig.
- Like a mole.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.616
- Are we clear?
- Like a crystal.

07:10.617 --> 07:11.858
Both: Shazam.

07:13.058 --> 07:13.930
Oh.

07:14.715 --> 07:15.905
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:16.251 --> 07:18.353
Bonnie, I didn't realize
you'd be joining us.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.155
Oh. Oh, I'd love to, if you're asking.

07:21.156 --> 07:23.024
- Oh, I'm not.
- Okay. All right.

07:23.441 --> 07:25.927
That's all right. I've got to run.

07:25.928 --> 07:28.519
I'm having drinks with
the GM of the Islanders.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.011
You know, something about
Danny and bags of money.

07:31.012 --> 07:32.742
I guess I'll just have to figure it out.

07:34.073 --> 07:35.326
So, Miss Banks,

07:35.922 --> 07:38.703
what do you say we just dive
right into this interview?

07:38.704 --> 07:40.208
I don't give interviews.

07:40.831 --> 07:42.511
Then why are we here?

07:42.512 --> 07:45.248
Well, I was wondering if
you'd like to get to know me...

07:45.249 --> 07:46.574
Off the record.

07:49.856 --> 07:50.869
(Chuckles)

07:51.612 --> 07:53.057
Well, at the moment...

07:54.008 --> 07:57.202
You know, it seems like you're
getting to know my thigh.

08:00.041 --> 08:01.886
Hey, what did I miss? How
do you think it's going?

08:01.887 --> 08:03.615
Hard to say. Right now it looks like

08:03.616 --> 08:05.239
they're just feeling each other out.

08:08.632 --> 08:10.056
Oh my God, Ben,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.847
thank you. She actually likes you.

08:12.848 --> 08:15.177
Yeah. Yeah. Some women actually do.

08:16.188 --> 08:17.572
Well, whatever it is that you're doing,

08:17.573 --> 08:19.431
just keep it up until she leaves.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.968
God, I hate her.

08:20.969 --> 08:22.381
What a perfect day.

08:22.382 --> 08:24.941
I have never seen Georgie
take to someone so quickly.

08:24.942 --> 08:27.029
I know, right? I love her.

08:28.744 --> 08:31.615
I think she's actually looking
forward to moving here now.

08:32.051 --> 08:34.759
She's moving here?

08:35.357 --> 08:37.020
Oh, well then,

08:37.022 --> 08:39.150
it's a good thing we're
getting along so great, huh?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.476
- Ben?
- I'm on it.

08:44.709 --> 08:45.811
Enjoying the view?

08:46.794 --> 08:48.020
More so now.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.867
We might not have Big Ben,

08:50.868 --> 08:53.121
but we do have the best regular-sized one.

08:53.122 --> 08:54.232
(Chuckles)

08:55.010 --> 08:56.921
Do you write these lines down in advance,

08:56.922 --> 08:58.284
or do they just come to you?

08:58.285 --> 08:59.844
(Chuckles) No, that's not a line.

08:59.845 --> 09:01.418
In fact the one thing
you should know about me

09:01.419 --> 09:02.782
is that I'm a terrible liar.

09:02.783 --> 09:04.663
Ask me anything. I'll prove it.

09:05.536 --> 09:07.244
How many girlfriends do you have?

09:08.026 --> 09:09.898
Just one. Her name's Emma

09:09.899 --> 09:11.407
and you'll never come between us.

09:11.408 --> 09:12.617
Good answer.

09:13.147 --> 09:14.950
Is that why you and Riley broke up?

09:14.951 --> 09:16.728
No no, that had nothing to do with it.

09:17.506 --> 09:18.783
Wait, what?

09:19.709 --> 09:21.019
I knew it.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.486
I knew the two of you had
gone out. You did, didn't you?

09:23.487 --> 09:24.576
No.

09:24.577 --> 09:26.262
Oh, you must be joking.

09:26.263 --> 09:27.611
(Laughs)

09:29.508 --> 09:30.589
You're not laughing.

09:31.035 --> 09:32.343
Okay, look.

09:32.344 --> 09:33.720
Please, don't say anything.

09:37.903 --> 09:39.192
Phillip!

09:41.113 --> 09:42.737
Well, apparently regular-sized Ben

09:42.738 --> 09:43.972
has a big-sized mouth.

09:47.548 --> 09:49.736
Ben? You went out with Ben?

09:50.158 --> 09:52.478
I can't believe you just
completely lied to me.

09:52.814 --> 09:54.094
Why didn't you tell me?

09:54.095 --> 09:56.455
Mainly because I was afraid
you would react like this.

09:56.456 --> 09:58.786
Which you are, so at least
I got that part right.

09:59.713 --> 10:01.237
<i>Ben: Tell him we never even had sex.</i>

10:01.238 --> 10:02.447
Oh my God.

10:02.448 --> 10:03.802
Ben, you are not helping.

10:05.094 --> 10:06.944
But if it helps, we actually didn't.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.498
This is your fault.

10:09.499 --> 10:10.955
Why did you have to say something?

10:10.956 --> 10:13.531
I bet Riley will be asking
you the same question.

10:13.532 --> 10:15.603
I am not going out with her, okay?

10:16.021 --> 10:17.964
Look, I'm not gonna let you pimp me out.

10:18.332 --> 10:19.819
Oh, come on.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.482
We have all done way worse for way less.

10:25.552 --> 10:26.980
It can't just be me.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.918
Look, I'm sorry. I can't do it.

10:29.919 --> 10:31.558
Why can't you be more like Ben?

10:31.559 --> 10:33.276
He'll hit on anything that walks.

10:33.277 --> 10:34.309
See?

10:35.611 --> 10:37.426
No offense, honey. I'm sure you're lovely.

10:37.427 --> 10:38.800
Oh, I'm not his.

10:39.168 --> 10:41.132
Well, not with that attitude, you're not.

10:44.072 --> 10:45.890
Oh, we have a make-up kiss.

10:47.401 --> 10:48.642
Make-up kiss?

10:49.683 --> 10:50.895
See?

10:50.896 --> 10:52.874
Why can't you be shameless like that?

10:54.502 --> 10:55.627
What if I like her?

10:55.628 --> 10:57.912
I can't start off our
relationship with a lie.

10:57.913 --> 10:59.983
Tucker's right. What if
he does sleep with her?

10:59.984 --> 11:01.505
I mean, how is that supposed to help me?

11:01.506 --> 11:03.275
Tucker never gets repeat business.

11:03.805 --> 11:05.005
(Mouths)

11:05.006 --> 11:07.592
Look, that is not true. Women love me.

11:07.593 --> 11:10.417
I can get Danny a new
contract in 20 minutes.

11:11.549 --> 11:13.551
30 if I think about my grandmother.

11:15.812 --> 11:18.140
- Okay, so you'll do it?
- No!

11:18.141 --> 11:20.643
This gigolo is saying gigo-no.

11:21.753 --> 11:22.930
And that's final.

11:22.931 --> 11:25.216
Fine. Then I'll not only tell Mary Hart

11:25.217 --> 11:27.469
about the camera and the
cameraman you borrowed,

11:27.470 --> 11:30.972
I'll tell her how you sell
locks of her hair online.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.576
Oh, snip snip.

11:34.301 --> 11:35.654
Snip snip.

11:40.591 --> 11:44.354
Um, do you think Valerie likes tapas?

11:46.524 --> 11:47.733
(Sighs)

11:47.734 --> 11:49.170
(Laughing)

11:50.617 --> 11:51.795
Phillip said he forgave me,

11:51.796 --> 11:53.882
but he's been weird and distant all day.

11:53.883 --> 11:55.637
I'm wondering if constantly
sneaking off with me

11:55.638 --> 11:57.287
to a dark hallway is hurting your case.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.845
Okay, you are going to
help me make my case.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.192
All right? 'Cause we're
gonna go back out there,

12:02.193 --> 12:03.648
and we're gonna prove
to him once and for all

12:03.649 --> 12:06.534
that there is absolutely
nothing going on between us.

12:06.535 --> 12:08.211
If that's truly what you believe.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.425
Ignore you... check.

12:10.902 --> 12:12.443
I knew I could count on you.

12:12.444 --> 12:13.763
All right, let's go.

12:13.764 --> 12:15.418
Oh! (Gasps)

12:15.911 --> 12:17.168
Ooh.

12:17.169 --> 12:18.510
Oh, seriously?

12:18.511 --> 12:20.506
I thought the target was just on my back.

12:22.668 --> 12:24.178
What am I gonna do?

12:24.179 --> 12:25.628
Oh, you can just put on my t-shirt.

12:29.944 --> 12:31.677
Whoo. (Chuckles)

12:32.459 --> 12:33.905
Wow.

12:33.906 --> 12:35.448
Guess there's a first time for everything.

12:35.449 --> 12:37.982
Oh, technically, that was my second time.

12:40.530 --> 12:41.433
Wait, what?

12:42.447 --> 12:43.703
Okay, don't look.

12:45.415 --> 12:46.859
Uh, I couldn't even if I wanted to.

12:46.860 --> 12:47.820
Can you help me please?

12:47.821 --> 12:49.104
Will you hurry up?

12:49.105 --> 12:51.080
Phillip's gonna wonder
what's taking us so long.

12:51.948 --> 12:53.285
It's pretty clear, actually.

12:53.616 --> 12:54.760
(Both scream)

12:56.080 --> 12:57.569
Phil, there you are.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.037
We've been looking everywhere for you.

13:02.899 --> 13:04.214
(Chuckles)

13:04.972 --> 13:06.906
Just call me "MVP,"

13:06.907 --> 13:09.174
most valuable playa.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.827
How'd it go? Is it bad news?

13:12.828 --> 13:13.984
Should I sit down?

13:13.985 --> 13:15.268
Actually, I'm better standing up.

13:16.156 --> 13:18.222
Turns out, so am I.

13:18.223 --> 13:19.608
<i>(Chuckles)</i>

13:19.609 --> 13:22.139
Which is why I will be watching you play

13:22.140 --> 13:24.958
from the owner's box for
the rest of your career.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.388
So I have a career?

13:26.389 --> 13:29.262
Yep. Yeah, she said a new
contract is on its way.

13:29.263 --> 13:31.899
Dude, I love older women.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.133
They're not afraid to tell
you what you're doing wrong.

13:34.466 --> 13:37.225
<i>- (Knocking on door)
- It turns, everything.</i>

13:40.111 --> 13:41.817
- Valerie?
- Hey, you.

13:42.203 --> 13:44.010
You left your wallet in the cab.

13:44.011 --> 13:44.913
Oh.

13:46.355 --> 13:48.153
- Excuse me.
- Girl, stop.

13:50.406 --> 13:51.490
Danny?

13:52.240 --> 13:53.257
Oh.

13:53.753 --> 13:54.840
Miss Banks,

13:54.841 --> 13:56.764
I didn't see you behind this pillow.

13:58.065 --> 14:00.656
So, Tuck-Tuck, you bag the cougar?

14:02.455 --> 14:03.494
Hi, Bonnie.

14:04.213 --> 14:05.347
Valerie!

14:06.087 --> 14:07.887
Hi. Hey.

14:08.198 --> 14:11.774
Hey, did you see a giant
cougar run past here?

14:13.546 --> 14:16.032
'Cause one just escaped from the zoo...

14:18.088 --> 14:20.415
And we're trying to bag it.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.131
Well, I guess I've been played.

14:24.940 --> 14:27.493
You people are something else.

14:27.494 --> 14:29.509
You know, I've always heard
that you were unethical,

14:29.847 --> 14:32.596
but congratulations,
you've outdone yourself.

14:33.278 --> 14:34.724
Don't worry, Danny.

14:34.725 --> 14:35.985
I won't be trading you.

14:35.986 --> 14:37.643
Really? Thank God.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.447
I'll be cutting you from the team.

14:40.216 --> 14:42.514
In fact, if I have anything to do with it,

14:42.515 --> 14:44.777
you will never play
another game in the NHL.

14:49.004 --> 14:51.947
Damn it if she don't
look good walking away.

14:54.906 --> 14:56.929
So... this is nice.

14:57.776 --> 14:59.075
Isn't this nice?

14:59.779 --> 15:01.455
I know I'm enjoying myself.

15:02.015 --> 15:03.462
Yes, lovely, isn't it?

15:03.463 --> 15:06.868
In fact, I think my new
favorite pre-dinner entertainment

15:06.869 --> 15:08.780
is finding my girlfriend naked in the loo

15:08.781 --> 15:09.815
with her ex-boyfriend.

15:11.383 --> 15:13.189
Phillip, please. I explained this to you.

15:13.190 --> 15:14.796
And she wasn't naked.

15:14.797 --> 15:16.134
She had her bra on.

15:17.889 --> 15:20.139
I'm sorry. I stand corrected.

15:20.140 --> 15:21.794
Once again, I am the idiot

15:21.795 --> 15:23.532
and you are right.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.028
Hey, don't be mad at Ben.

15:25.029 --> 15:26.814
He was just trying to help.

15:26.815 --> 15:28.578
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.049
And you need to believe her.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.307
Okay? You don't want to mess this thing up.

15:32.308 --> 15:33.435
Trust me, I did,

15:33.436 --> 15:34.753
and I've never regretted anything so much

15:34.754 --> 15:36.068
in my entire life.

15:36.778 --> 15:38.208
Is that true?

15:38.209 --> 15:39.607
It's so true.

15:40.308 --> 15:42.221
But you don't still feel that way, do you?

15:42.222 --> 15:43.784
Yeah, of course I do.

15:43.785 --> 15:45.736
I mean, sure I joke about us all the time,

15:45.737 --> 15:47.771
but I never got over what happened.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.078
It was all my fault.

15:49.079 --> 15:51.054
No no no. We both messed up.

15:51.055 --> 15:53.589
I still regret how I handled things.

15:53.590 --> 15:54.550
- You do?
- Yeah.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.792
We both said and did a lot of stupid stuff,

15:57.793 --> 16:00.519
but I never meant to hurt you.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.127
And I never meant to hurt you.

16:03.404 --> 16:04.916
I'm so sorry.

16:04.917 --> 16:06.287
Yeah, me too.

16:18.772 --> 16:20.377
So, should we start with some appetizers?

16:20.378 --> 16:22.360
The crab cakes here are amazing.

16:22.810 --> 16:24.451
Mmm. Appeys.

16:26.874 --> 16:29.431
Gary, this is your last
chance for the trade.

16:29.835 --> 16:33.537
No, I swear I will
never ever call you back.

16:33.538 --> 16:34.642
<i>(Knocking on door)</i>

16:35.431 --> 16:37.960
(Sighs) I will call you right back.

16:39.718 --> 16:41.051
We need to talk.

16:41.052 --> 16:42.309
Actually, you need to leave.

16:42.310 --> 16:45.294
And on your way out,
fire whoever let you in.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.203
Okay, what we did was wrong,

16:47.204 --> 16:49.108
but you can't take it out on Danny.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.052
He had nothing to do with it.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.686
He is a talented player
that any team in the league

16:53.687 --> 16:55.311
would be happy to have.

16:55.312 --> 16:56.913
I actually agree with you.

16:57.385 --> 16:59.032
He's not my problem.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.723
His management is.

17:01.325 --> 17:02.773
I'm his management.

17:06.152 --> 17:07.182
Look.

17:07.183 --> 17:08.594
You may not like me,

17:08.595 --> 17:10.316
but I have been managing his career

17:10.317 --> 17:12.584
since he was six and
played in that men's league.

17:13.769 --> 17:17.433
I made sure that he had the
best equipment money could buy.

17:17.434 --> 17:19.545
So I said good-bye to new boobs.

17:21.752 --> 17:24.546
I got up every morning at 4:30 to make sure

17:24.547 --> 17:26.974
that he had three hot
breakfasts before practice.

17:26.976 --> 17:29.746
Danny and I are team Wheeler,

17:29.747 --> 17:31.695
and nothing can come between us.

17:33.820 --> 17:38.106
Well, then I guess team Wheeler
needs to find a new team.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.199
And please tell Tucker to
quit texting me, thank you.

17:46.182 --> 17:47.812
What am I gonna do?

17:47.813 --> 17:49.422
I mean, I'm too tall to be an astronaut,

17:49.423 --> 17:51.663
and too afraid of horses to be a cowboy.

17:53.693 --> 17:55.301
What about me?

17:55.302 --> 17:57.536
I sent a very private picture to Valerie,

17:57.537 --> 17:59.793
and I think it went to my mom instead.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.239
Oh, what happened?

18:03.575 --> 18:04.832
You were in there forever.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.775
All good. Mm-hmm.

18:06.776 --> 18:08.952
Yeah, it was pretty touch-and-go
there for a little while,

18:08.953 --> 18:12.373
but she did not know
who she was dealing with.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.435
All right?

18:13.436 --> 18:15.553
I made her see what an
asset you are to this team

18:15.554 --> 18:17.912
and that they would be nothing without you.

18:17.913 --> 18:20.312
Oh my God, thank you.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.255
So the deal's done?

18:22.256 --> 18:23.383
Almost.

18:23.972 --> 18:26.010
But I think I'm gonna let somebody else

18:26.011 --> 18:27.597
iron out the details.

18:27.598 --> 18:28.705
What are you talking about?

18:28.706 --> 18:31.123
I'm talking about me. I need a break.

18:31.553 --> 18:33.859
Honey, you are a great hockey player,

18:33.860 --> 18:36.387
and I've been lucky enough
to have gone on this ride.

18:36.388 --> 18:38.770
But I think it's time I got off.

18:39.489 --> 18:41.799
Wait, you're not gonna
be my manager anymore?

18:42.498 --> 18:43.980
But I can't do this without you.

18:44.316 --> 18:46.054
Oh, yes you can, Danny.

18:46.661 --> 18:48.086
You need to grow up...

18:48.087 --> 18:50.908
And I need to let you do it.

18:51.437 --> 18:53.174
What about team Wheeler?

18:53.175 --> 18:56.144
I will always be on your team.

18:56.913 --> 18:58.625
I'm your mother.

19:01.644 --> 19:02.741
(Sighs)

19:04.124 --> 19:07.318
Well, how about we go get
some victory libations.

19:07.319 --> 19:08.717
Ah, word of the day?

19:08.718 --> 19:09.763
Nope.

19:09.764 --> 19:11.085
I actually knew that one.

19:11.086 --> 19:13.144
You did? Danny, good for you.

19:27.371 --> 19:28.620
Well, here we are again.

19:29.312 --> 19:30.289
You trying to convince me

19:30.290 --> 19:31.929
that there's nothing between you and Ben.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.207
There isn't.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.338
And I promise from this moment forward

19:35.339 --> 19:37.761
to be completely open and honest with you.

19:38.462 --> 19:41.200
Then I suppose I only have one question.

19:41.718 --> 19:43.100
Do you or do you not

19:43.101 --> 19:44.725
still have feelings for Ben?

19:46.901 --> 19:48.577
And I think I've got my answer.

19:48.578 --> 19:49.793
No, wait. Wait wait wait.

19:49.794 --> 19:50.946
Wait wait.

19:51.253 --> 19:53.404
Yes, I will always care for him.

19:53.881 --> 19:55.714
I would be lying if I didn't admit that,

19:55.715 --> 19:57.622
but I don't want to be with him.

20:00.027 --> 20:01.656
I want to be with you.

20:04.182 --> 20:05.860
I wish that was enough for me.

20:07.717 --> 20:08.943
But it's not.

20:10.206 --> 20:13.288
Riley, you are an amazing girl,

20:13.289 --> 20:14.566
and if he ever does get you back,

20:14.567 --> 20:16.000
he is a lucky man.

20:18.314 --> 20:19.500
I'm sorry, Riley.

20:21.469 --> 20:22.696
Yeah, me too.

20:26.836 --> 20:28.967
See? Make-up hug.

20:28.968 --> 20:30.129
It's all good.

20:40.324 --> 20:41.667
(Chuckles)

20:41.668 --> 20:42.589
Huh?

20:42.952 --> 20:45.595
Okay, Emma. Don't judge me.

20:45.596 --> 20:47.338
Where was the last place you saw my phone?

20:48.241 --> 20:49.359
Knock knock.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.167
I'm guessing that someone
is looking for this?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.955
Oh my God, Riley, thank
you. You're a lifesaver.

20:54.956 --> 20:56.387
I don't know what I'd do without you.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.670
Oh, you'd figure it out.

20:57.671 --> 20:59.234
People are doing it all over town.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.120
Yeah.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.612
Look, I'm really sorry about Phillip.

21:02.613 --> 21:03.976
- No, you're not.
- I know.

21:05.470 --> 21:07.525
It just seemed like the right thing to say.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.559
It was.

21:10.689 --> 21:12.032
I'll see you later, Ben.

21:14.394 --> 21:15.477

21:15.478 --> 21:17.171
<i>She so likes me.</i>
