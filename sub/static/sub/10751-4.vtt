00:29.720 --> 00:32.840
Wow. That's quite something.
Quite an honour.

00:32.850 --> 00:34.000
I know.

00:34.010 --> 00:35.400
They must be
impressed with you.

00:35.410 --> 00:38.280
I didn't even know they had
an employee of the month.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.080
Really? I thought
you won it once.

00:40.090 --> 00:42.240
No, that was...
everyone thought I was dead.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.600
A-ha.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.560
Hmm, employee...

00:45.578 --> 00:46.840
..of the month.

00:46.853 --> 00:49.329
Yeah, it's,
it's a valued title.

00:49.334 --> 00:50.569
Have you ever won it?

00:50.576 --> 00:51.080
Er, no.

00:51.099 --> 00:52.163
No.

00:52.175 --> 00:54.722
I haven't.
I don't know, Jen, sometimes I think

00:54.738 --> 00:57.123
it's because I just want it,
so damn much!

00:58.207 --> 01:00.680
I am the employee of the month.

01:00.696 --> 01:02.121
And yet, to a casual observer,

01:02.135 --> 01:04.641
it'd appear that you do
very little around here.

01:04.657 --> 01:07.880
Yeah, they must have
seen through that.

01:07.898 --> 01:12.161
I think someone up there must
have sensed something in me.

01:12.177 --> 01:15.242
Something I've always
known was there, er...

01:15.257 --> 01:17.160
a greatness?

01:17.178 --> 01:21.762
No, I'm not saying
that, but...something...

01:21.776 --> 01:24.441
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sensing something.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.281
Don't worry,
I won't let it go to my head.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.563
Moss, guess who's won
employee of the month?

01:30.576 --> 01:31.083
Roy.

01:31.098 --> 01:32.682
No.

01:32.696 --> 01:34.123
Richmond. No.

01:34.135 --> 01:34.843
Harry.

01:34.857 --> 01:36.001
Who's Harry?

01:36.015 --> 01:37.602
The postman. No.

01:37.618 --> 01:38.280
Me.

01:38.296 --> 01:39.443
No.

01:39.456 --> 01:40.962
I said Roy, right? Richmond?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.000
Me!

01:42.018 --> 01:44.480
Oh, about time!

01:46.325 --> 01:48.483
Whatever happened to Richmond?

01:48.497 --> 01:50.560
He got scurvy.

01:54.326 --> 01:56.043
Can you be more specific?

01:56.057 --> 01:59.000
I'm trying to picture your
role in Reynholm Industries.

01:59.017 --> 02:04.723
Well, I'm the boss, head honcho,
numero uno, Mr Big,

02:04.738 --> 02:11.640
The Godfather, Lord Of The Rings,
the Bourne Identity, er...

02:11.657 --> 02:13.602
Taxi Driver, Jaws.

02:14.686 --> 02:17.722
I forgot the question,
quite a while back. Who are you again?

02:17.736 --> 02:19.560
I'm April Shepherd.

02:19.577 --> 02:22.882
You're Richest magazine's Man Of
The Year. I'm doing the profile.

02:22.898 --> 02:24.120
Oh yes, that's right.

02:24.135 --> 02:26.241
I know you're the boss,
but what does that entail?

02:26.255 --> 02:28.203
Oh, many things.

02:28.218 --> 02:30.040
Like this morning,
for instance.

02:30.055 --> 02:33.000
I had to choose the Employee
Of The Month, from the box.

02:35.726 --> 02:38.120
May I ask,
what are you doing on that pad?

02:38.137 --> 02:40.723
One of my little
hobbies is caricature.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.882
Sometimes, I like to sketch
someone as I'm talking to them.

02:45.927 --> 02:46.603
May I?

02:46.618 --> 02:48.322
Well, I'm not very good.

02:48.337 --> 02:49.880
I'm no Truman Capote.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.920
Great, OK. Um...

02:58.935 --> 03:02.043
I'll tell you what,
let's just do some quick-fire questions.

03:02.055 --> 03:04.802
Maybe they'll give me an
insight into the real you.

03:04.818 --> 03:05.963
OK.

03:05.975 --> 03:08.243
Tell me, who's your favourite
person from history?

03:08.255 --> 03:09.800
Sherlock Holmes.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.880
Well, he's fictional.

03:11.896 --> 03:16.123
Whoa! I think you'd better
check your facts there.

03:16.135 --> 03:17.201
Fictional?

03:17.215 --> 03:19.643
Who took care of the
business with the giant dog

03:19.656 --> 03:21.161
that was eating everybody?

03:21.178 --> 03:23.240
Well, it wasn't Watson.

03:23.258 --> 03:26.123
Don't tell me,
I suppose he was fictional too.

03:26.138 --> 03:28.603
Maybe there was no giant dog.

03:30.206 --> 03:34.803
No, no, I think you're playing
games with me, young lady.

03:35.727 --> 03:38.002
OK, then,
favourite fictional character.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.560
Oh, ha-ha, ha!
The Elephant Man.

03:40.577 --> 03:43.002
Tell you what,
let me widen the question out.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.442
Favourite popular figure?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.321
Churchill.

03:46.335 --> 03:48.123
Well, what is it
you like about him?

03:48.138 --> 03:50.320
I love the way he says,

03:50.335 --> 03:53.840
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes."

03:55.286 --> 03:58.802
I think, perhaps it's you
who's playing games with me.

03:58.816 --> 04:01.200
You're a very surprising man,
Mr Reynholm.

04:01.216 --> 04:02.163
Yes.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.921
I am a surprising man.

04:07.005 --> 04:09.442
April, may I take
you to dinner?

04:09.455 --> 04:11.562
Oh, I don't think I could..

04:11.578 --> 04:13.003
In Paris.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.243
Paris?

04:15.256 --> 04:18.402
Paris, yes. It's the name of
a new restaurant in Hull.

04:18.415 --> 04:20.481
That's right,
we're going to Hull!

04:22.567 --> 04:26.482
Hey, Roy, come over here.
Look at this.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.122
"The biggest adventure
you can ever take

04:31.136 --> 04:35.643
"is to live the life of your dreams" -
Oprah Winfrey.

04:35.655 --> 04:38.403
I suppose that is the
biggest adventure.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.722
Guys, come on in.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.323
Sit down.

04:43.336 --> 04:44.643
Is this a new desk?

04:44.658 --> 04:47.363
Yeah, I thought I needed
some new furniture.

04:47.375 --> 04:49.961
So, I got some stuff from upstairs.
Sit down, please.

04:56.365 --> 05:00.763
I just thought, what with all
this extra attention on us...

05:00.775 --> 05:04.480
on me, it might be worth
looking at ourselves and saying,

05:04.496 --> 05:08.600
"Hey, am I really giving
it 110 per cent?"

05:08.618 --> 05:11.282
And if not, "Why not?
What the heck is wrong with me?

05:11.298 --> 05:13.202
"Am I mentally
ill or something?"

05:13.216 --> 05:16.801
Roy, let's start with you.

05:16.815 --> 05:19.641
When you're upstairs,
fiddling about with computers...

05:21.288 --> 05:23.480
..would it hurt to smile?

05:23.495 --> 05:26.240
Don't you realise what a
difference that would make?

05:26.257 --> 05:29.320
Eh? Come on,
let's see a smile now, come on.

05:33.687 --> 05:35.603
No, more warmth, warmer.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.842
You're just showing more teeth,
that's not warmth.

05:39.857 --> 05:43.281
I would say that's more of a
threatening look, actually.

05:43.296 --> 05:47.200
I'll tell you what, Roy, keep at it.
That's your homework. Moss.

05:47.218 --> 05:49.323
So, what's your speech
going to be about?

05:49.338 --> 05:50.840
What speech?

05:50.855 --> 05:52.962
Every employee of the
month has to give a speech

05:52.978 --> 05:54.923
in their area of expertise.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.723
Which for you is computers.

06:00.368 --> 06:02.003
Where do I have to...?

06:02.016 --> 06:04.400
At the monthly
shareholders meeting.

06:05.725 --> 06:06.841
When do I have to...?

06:06.855 --> 06:08.441
Friday.

06:08.457 --> 06:10.360
What time...?

06:10.375 --> 06:11.641
Morning.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.361
How's that?

06:42.526 --> 06:43.562
What's up, guys?

06:43.577 --> 06:44.842
All right, Jen?

06:44.855 --> 06:46.882
Urgh!

06:47.925 --> 06:51.281
God! Just writing a speech.

06:51.296 --> 06:53.721
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How's that going?

06:53.736 --> 06:55.443
Good, good, good, good...

06:57.047 --> 07:00.040
You know, I was thinking, er...

07:00.056 --> 07:02.523
if there's anything
you guys wanna say,

07:02.538 --> 07:04.163
I can put it in,
it's no problem.

07:04.178 --> 07:07.561
Oh, oh, yeah, oh,
mm, interesting.

07:07.578 --> 07:10.961
Um, is there anything you'd like
to say to the shareholders, Moss?

07:10.978 --> 07:13.081
Just say, "Hi."

07:13.098 --> 07:14.360
Say, "Hi," from us.

07:15.927 --> 07:16.920
OK.

07:18.508 --> 07:19.882
I love this.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.120
I wonder how many more
times she's gonna come in.

07:22.133 --> 07:25.329
I think, it'd be a good idea if
you two contributed to this, I do.

07:25.334 --> 07:27.129
Oh, yeah. Why?

07:27.136 --> 07:29.640
Hmm. I think,
I think it would give you experience

07:29.659 --> 07:31.601
in writing a speech
for a public figure.

07:31.615 --> 07:34.640
Well, obviously,
in our line of work that would be handy.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.683
But, you know what, Jen,
I'm actually, I'm snowed under here.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.842
Wait a second! Wait a second!
Oh, oh, what are we doing?

07:48.855 --> 07:49.881
Eh?

07:49.895 --> 07:51.280
We should write that speech!

07:51.297 --> 07:52.320
What? Why?

07:52.338 --> 07:53.403
Offer to write the speech.

07:53.417 --> 07:54.683
No.

07:54.696 --> 07:56.003
You have to! I can't!

07:56.016 --> 07:57.843
She'll know something's
up if I do it!

07:57.857 --> 07:59.240
Why would I do that?

07:59.256 --> 08:00.843
Moss, do you trust me?

08:00.857 --> 08:02.681
No.

08:02.698 --> 08:03.323
Do you trust me?

08:03.337 --> 08:04.400
No.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.923
If you trust me,
then offer to write that speech!

08:06.936 --> 08:09.080
I. Don't. Trust. You.

08:10.325 --> 08:11.401
Hello.

08:11.415 --> 08:14.642
'I feel really bad having all
the fun writing this speech.'

08:15.725 --> 08:16.961
Offer, offer, offer.

08:16.975 --> 08:22.042
Well, I suppose we could write
the speech so that, you know,

08:22.056 --> 08:24.282
you look like you know
what you're talking about.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.842
Thanks, I'm off for lunch.
Leave it on my desk.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.563
My God.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.280
I know.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.003
That's brilliant.

08:35.018 --> 08:38.682
So, now you understand why we have
to write that speech for Jen.

08:38.696 --> 08:41.722
She will say anything
we tell her to.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.403
She will say anything
we tell her to.

08:44.415 --> 08:49.040
We can put any old bollocks in that
speech and she shall repeat it.

08:49.056 --> 08:51.280
It's going to be hilarious.

08:51.296 --> 08:54.323
Sometimes I could
kiss your mind, Roy.

08:55.366 --> 08:56.961
OK, so let's just, um...

08:56.976 --> 08:59.440
I don't know,
let's just throw around a few ideas.

08:59.458 --> 09:00.762
OK. OK.

09:00.778 --> 09:03.960
Ah...oh, could we tell her...

09:03.977 --> 09:07.361
that there's an apple
inside every Apple Mac?

09:09.245 --> 09:10.201
It's good. Yeah.

09:11.368 --> 09:14.242
We could say that Bill
Gates is called Bill Gates,

09:14.255 --> 09:16.002
because he owns a lot of gates.

09:16.015 --> 09:19.280
Hmmm. That's good,
but it's not quite punchy enough,

09:19.295 --> 09:24.481
and it's probably true now anyway.
I'll bet he does own a lot of gates.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.121
He probably does.

09:30.005 --> 09:31.802
It's got to be something big!

09:33.406 --> 09:35.281
I think I may have it.

09:36.246 --> 09:37.363
What?

09:37.378 --> 09:40.522
You best put seatbelts
on your ears, Roy,

09:40.536 --> 09:43.880
cos I'm gonna take them for
the ride of their lives!

09:54.727 --> 09:55.682
Delightful.

09:55.697 --> 09:58.443
Oh, no, no, no. You're silly.

09:58.457 --> 10:02.120
Do you know, I've never been so
enchanted by a woman in all my life.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.360
What's your name again?
I know you told me.

10:07.208 --> 10:08.240
April.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.120
Ah, what a charming name.

10:10.137 --> 10:12.762
Always been one
of my favourites.

10:12.776 --> 10:17.083
April, after dinner,
would you do me the honour

10:17.095 --> 10:18.803
of accompanying me to my bed?

10:21.168 --> 10:22.403
Oh, erm...

10:22.415 --> 10:24.561
No, I've said too much!

10:24.578 --> 10:28.961
I've let my heart overpower my head,
which is my wont.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.960
But I don't care.

10:31.975 --> 10:33.120
I find you enchanting.

10:34.527 --> 10:36.483
And there's a condom
machine in the toilet.

10:42.365 --> 10:44.843
I'm very flattered,
Douglas but, erm,

10:44.856 --> 10:48.202
there's a problem. There's
something I should tell you. Go on.

10:48.216 --> 10:52.001
Erm, I... I have a secret.

10:52.017 --> 10:53.842
I could dance
around the subject,

10:53.857 --> 10:57.003
but I like you, Douglas.
I want to be straight with you. Oh?

11:00.246 --> 11:01.963
I used to be a man, Douglas.

11:03.528 --> 11:05.681
I used to be a man.

11:05.696 --> 11:08.003
I wish there was an easier
way of saying that,

11:08.017 --> 11:10.043
but, believe me, there's not.

11:10.058 --> 11:14.281
I've had a lot of hormone therapy
and a number of operations.

11:14.297 --> 11:16.041
I'm really sorry.

11:16.058 --> 11:18.440
I hope you don't
feel I deceived you.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.042
I understand if you
would rather I left.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.641
I don't care.

11:26.567 --> 11:27.521
What?

11:28.567 --> 11:30.400
Doesn't bother me.

11:31.486 --> 11:33.161
Doesn't bother you at all?

11:33.177 --> 11:36.280
It takes all sorts
to make a world.

11:36.297 --> 11:39.121
Wow, it bothers most men.

11:39.138 --> 11:42.683
I am not most men and
the offer still stands.

11:42.696 --> 11:44.443
Are you up for it?

11:53.885 --> 11:56.842
Amazing, just amazing.

11:56.856 --> 11:58.001
You liked it?

11:58.015 --> 12:01.041
You really know your
way around that area.

12:02.928 --> 12:04.160
Well...

12:04.176 --> 12:07.642
Tell me, what are you doing
tomorrow night, April?

12:07.658 --> 12:10.483
I was thinking of staying
in and watching the darts.

12:10.498 --> 12:11.641
You've read my mind.

12:13.088 --> 12:17.040
# '60s Swing music

12:58.926 --> 13:00.963
What is it?

13:00.977 --> 13:03.080
This, Jen,

13:03.095 --> 13:06.602
is the internet.

13:12.687 --> 13:13.680
What?

13:13.695 --> 13:15.080
That's right.

13:15.097 --> 13:16.520
This is the internet?

13:18.288 --> 13:20.442
The whole internet?

13:20.457 --> 13:21.563
Yep.

13:21.578 --> 13:25.240
I asked for a loan of it,
so that you could use it in your speech.

13:26.325 --> 13:28.122
It's so small.

13:28.137 --> 13:30.760
That's one of the
surprising things about it.

13:30.778 --> 13:34.000
Hang on,
it doesn't have any wires or anything.

13:34.017 --> 13:35.921
It's wireless.

13:35.938 --> 13:39.390
Oh, yes,
everything's wireless nowadays, yeah.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.963
I can use it in my speech?
What if someone needs it?

13:41.978 --> 13:43.521
Oh, no, no, people will

13:43.537 --> 13:45.882
still be able to go online.
It will still work.

13:45.895 --> 13:47.402
Oh, good. Good.

13:47.417 --> 13:50.442
I tell you,
you present this to the shareholders

13:50.457 --> 13:53.243
and you will get
quite a response.

13:53.255 --> 13:54.603
Can I touch it?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.442
Ooh, it's so light.

14:00.457 --> 14:04.083
Of course it is, Jen.
The internet doesn't weigh anything.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.883
Ha-ha. No, of course it doesn't.
Ha-ha. Ha-ha.

14:09.086 --> 14:12.200
Hey! What is Jen doing
with the internet?

14:14.127 --> 14:16.401
Moss said I could
use it for my speech.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.841
Are you insane?
What if she drops it?

14:18.857 --> 14:21.042
I won't drop it,
I'll look after it.

14:21.058 --> 14:26.403
No. No, no, no, no, Jen. No, this
needs to go straight back to Big Ben.

14:26.415 --> 14:28.081
Big Ben?

14:28.098 --> 14:31.400
It goes on top of Big Ben.
That's where you get the best reception.

14:32.328 --> 14:34.680
I promise I won't let
anything happen to it.

14:34.696 --> 14:38.961
No, Jen, I'm sorry. The elders of the
internet would never stand for it.

14:38.978 --> 14:42.921
No, no, Roy. I spoke to the elders
of the internet, not one hour ago.

14:42.936 --> 14:45.240
I told them Jen had won
employee of the month

14:45.257 --> 14:49.201
and they were so impressed - wanted
to do whatever they could to help.

14:50.366 --> 14:54.163
Wait a minute,
the elders of the internet?

14:54.176 --> 15:00.042
The elders of the internet know who
I am? You've got to let me have it!

15:01.205 --> 15:03.283
No, Jen, I'm sorry,
it's just too risky.

15:03.298 --> 15:05.683
Oh, please, Roy.

15:05.697 --> 15:10.322
Well, Moss,
has it been completely demagnetised?

15:11.366 --> 15:13.960
By Stephen Hawking himself.

15:13.977 --> 15:15.963
He sends his congratulations.

15:17.368 --> 15:20.721
Well, if it's OK with the Hawk.

15:21.808 --> 15:22.883
So, can I have it?

15:23.968 --> 15:24.923
You can.

15:34.127 --> 15:35.681
Oh, don't forget your speech.

15:35.696 --> 15:36.643
Oh, thank you.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.040
Slowly.

15:53.326 --> 15:56.763
April, these past few days
have been like a dream.

15:56.778 --> 16:02.080
Usually, I can't wait to get away
from a woman once I've ejaculated,

16:03.607 --> 16:04.560
but with you,

16:06.208 --> 16:09.003
I don't know, I feel alive.

16:09.015 --> 16:10.880
April, I love you.

16:11.966 --> 16:13.120
What?

16:13.135 --> 16:16.283
That's right,
I totally love the bloody arse off you.

16:18.088 --> 16:20.082
Oh, Douglas, I love you too.

16:21.126 --> 16:22.403
Oh, poppet,

16:22.415 --> 16:27.080
to think when we met, you were so
worried that you came from Iran.

16:35.165 --> 16:36.240
What?

16:36.258 --> 16:38.562
When we met. As if I'd be

16:38.575 --> 16:42.042
worried about something like that.
I don't care where you're from.

16:42.055 --> 16:45.121
Iran, France, doesn't bother me.
I'm very modern.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.842
I'm not from Iran.

16:48.847 --> 16:51.203
Well, you said something
along those lines.

16:51.215 --> 16:53.522
No, not Iran, a man.

16:53.537 --> 16:56.841
I said I used to be a man!

16:56.856 --> 16:59.402
You used to be a man?

17:01.007 --> 17:03.923
Yes!

17:03.936 --> 17:05.363
Oh, God!

17:41.326 --> 17:44.482
Well, we have a very interesting
talk lined up for today.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.960
Our employee of the month,
and computer expert, Jen Barber,

17:47.976 --> 17:52.600
has kindly agreed to say a few words
about her role in the IT department.

17:52.615 --> 17:57.360
Now, speaking as someone who doesn't
know the difference between a laptop

17:57.376 --> 18:00.041
and, erm, the larger one,

18:00.057 --> 18:03.203
I'm certainly looking forward
to hearing what she has to say.

18:13.806 --> 18:15.922
Good morning.

18:15.937 --> 18:19.242
When I was asked
to give a speech

18:19.255 --> 18:23.803
about what it is I do and everything,
I was very excited.

18:23.817 --> 18:26.480
At last, I thought,

18:26.495 --> 18:32.803
a chance to explain the wonders
of technology to ordinary folk.

18:34.448 --> 18:40.402
But then I thought, "Who wants to
listen to a boring old speech?"

18:42.486 --> 18:44.000
Wouldn't it be better

18:44.016 --> 18:47.960
if I could actually bring one of
these wonders in to show you it?

18:47.975 --> 18:51.883
Say, oh, I don't know,
the internet!

18:51.895 --> 18:54.321
I think it would - and I have.

18:54.337 --> 18:58.682
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to present to you the internet!

19:01.006 --> 19:02.922
No flash photography,
you'll harm it.

19:07.287 --> 19:08.760
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:08.777 --> 19:10.000
Why's no-one laughing?

19:10.017 --> 19:12.921
If anything were to
happen to this box,

19:12.937 --> 19:17.002
the world as we know it
would fall into chaos.

19:17.018 --> 19:19.960
Planes would drop from the sky,
like tables.

19:19.976 --> 19:24.962
Society would tear itself apart
like an angry child with a napkin.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.761
Man's primeval instinct

19:27.775 --> 19:31.200
to survive at any cost,
would lead to terrible violence,

19:32.605 --> 19:34.360
so, please,
no flash photography.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.161
I must say this is all
very impressive, Douglas.

19:42.176 --> 19:43.961
What exactly are
you working on?

19:43.977 --> 19:45.202
I dunno.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.882
April, we need to talk.

19:49.896 --> 19:51.880
Darling, couldn't
we do this at home?

19:51.895 --> 19:54.442
I was hoping we'd get
shit-faced and watch telly.

19:54.456 --> 19:58.240
There'll be no more getting
shit-faced and watching telly.

19:58.256 --> 20:01.363
There'll be no more
Steven Seagal marathons,

20:01.377 --> 20:04.040
and there'll be no more
paintballing weekends.

20:04.056 --> 20:08.080
I'm afraid our adventure
has come to an end.

20:08.096 --> 20:10.440
What? But... But why?

20:10.456 --> 20:12.482
It's not you, it's me.

20:12.495 --> 20:14.363
No, actually it's not me,
it is you.

20:14.376 --> 20:15.720
I'm sorry.

20:15.737 --> 20:17.842
You don't think of me as a woman,
do you?

20:17.856 --> 20:19.763
What? Of course I do!

20:19.775 --> 20:21.843
It bothers you that
I used to be a man.

20:21.855 --> 20:25.601
No, I love that you used to be a man.
It's your thing.

20:26.966 --> 20:28.762
I love thinking
about that operation.

20:29.808 --> 20:32.080
Oh, please, look at me.

20:32.096 --> 20:36.043
I am a woman.
This is a woman in front of you.

20:36.056 --> 20:37.401
Excuse me.

20:37.418 --> 20:39.523
I am a woman!

20:42.167 --> 20:44.000
You're tearing me apart.

20:44.016 --> 20:47.042
Please, Douglas...

20:47.056 --> 20:49.801
I'm sorry,
it's beyond my control.

20:49.817 --> 20:52.360
Please, Douglas, please!

20:52.378 --> 20:53.962
Just go.

20:53.976 --> 20:56.042
You're making this
harder for me.

20:58.888 --> 21:03.242
How could you do this?
How could you do this to me?!

21:09.886 --> 21:11.480
You bastard.

22:02.647 --> 22:04.680
And that's what the
flashing light's for.

22:04.696 --> 22:06.280
Any more?

22:06.295 --> 22:07.480
Is it heavy?

22:07.498 --> 22:10.283
Is it heavy?
That's a bit of a silly question.

22:10.297 --> 22:12.240
The internet doesn't
weigh anything.

22:14.526 --> 22:17.283
OK, guys,
I guess I should wrap it up.

22:18.568 --> 22:19.600
No, no.

22:19.615 --> 22:22.040
I really have to finish up.

22:22.058 --> 22:25.283
More! More! More! More!

22:25.295 --> 22:27.563
Guys! Oh, my God,
you really like me.

22:27.576 --> 22:29.243
This really isn't that funny.

22:29.255 --> 22:30.840
I know, it's terrible.

22:30.855 --> 22:33.242
I thought at least we'd
get a good story out it.

22:33.257 --> 22:34.561
Something we'd remember.

22:40.327 --> 22:41.841
It's over, April.

22:45.048 --> 22:47.200
Oh, Jesus.

22:47.217 --> 22:48.280
The internet!

22:50.645 --> 22:51.723
Argh!

22:52.128 --> 22:53.440
We're all gonna die!

22:59.128 --> 23:00.363
Everybody, stay calm!

23:28.686 --> 23:30.321
'He needs to hold his nerve...

23:35.248 --> 23:36.360
'He's done it!'

23:38.205 --> 23:41.243
But it's not the same.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.122
Oh, April.
