WEBVTT

00:00.354 --> 00:01.996
Previously on "Station 19"...

00:02.021 --> 00:03.399
This isn't anything serious, so...

00:03.424 --> 00:05.108
no attachments, no restrictions.

00:05.133 --> 00:06.948
Do what we want... See who we want.

00:06.973 --> 00:08.605
Like other people?

00:08.630 --> 00:10.007
Might be time for me
to quit firefighting.

00:10.008 --> 00:12.501
- Have you ever thought about Medic One?
- You think I'd be good for that?

00:12.526 --> 00:13.613
You called my family?

00:13.638 --> 00:15.384
I invited them over for dinner next week.

00:15.409 --> 00:16.946
Maybe I should take a look around, too.

00:16.971 --> 00:18.473
Find a condo, sell the house?

00:18.498 --> 00:19.967
Told my best friend about us today.

00:19.992 --> 00:21.239
You're dating the Chief?!

00:21.264 --> 00:22.663
I know you know better

00:22.688 --> 00:23.913
than to actually tell anyone
in the department.

00:23.938 --> 00:25.734
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.723
- All right, be back soon.
- Okay, thanks.

00:32.853 --> 00:35.736
Remember when you were
a kid, being asked...

00:35.761 --> 00:37.758
what do you wanna be when you grow up?

00:37.783 --> 00:40.327
How many of you said firefighter?

00:40.352 --> 00:41.855
Sounds like fun, right?

00:41.880 --> 00:44.182
Busting through walls,

00:44.207 --> 00:46.195
running through flames,

00:46.220 --> 00:47.585
saving people...

00:48.859 --> 00:50.084
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:50.109 --> 00:51.820
Thank you so much. My baby.

00:51.845 --> 00:53.349
You're lady firefighters?

00:53.374 --> 00:55.189
Yes, we are.

00:55.213 --> 00:57.828
Seems so simple when we're little...

00:57.853 --> 01:00.716
- So uncomplicated.
- I love busting through walls!

01:00.716 --> 01:02.046
And doors.

01:02.071 --> 01:03.886
I wanna bust through more things.

01:03.911 --> 01:05.831
Thanks for the quick response back there.

01:05.856 --> 01:07.705
- But eventually...
- So, Tanner.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.546
Should I be expecting you
to swing by after shift

01:09.571 --> 01:11.178
for your bi-weekly Herrera booty call?

01:11.203 --> 01:13.295
...we all have to grow up.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.685
No judgment, of course.

01:14.710 --> 01:16.802
Booty calls happen.
One thing leads to another

01:16.827 --> 01:18.469
and the adrenaline's pumping, and bam.

01:18.494 --> 01:19.789
Booty calls.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.456
You know, sometimes,
a few times, in the shower,

01:21.481 --> 01:22.810
outside the shower.
Drying off from the shower...

01:22.835 --> 01:24.719
Yeah, I mean, it's not
a given that I'll be over.

01:24.744 --> 01:26.664
Exactly. And it's not
a given I'll be free.

01:26.689 --> 01:28.753
I might have plans,
maybe with other people.

01:28.778 --> 01:30.538
I might, too. Also with other people.

01:30.563 --> 01:32.528
And if that were the case,
it wouldn't be a big deal.

01:32.553 --> 01:34.055
It wouldn't even be a deal.

01:34.080 --> 01:36.282
Because booty among friends
can be just that.

01:36.307 --> 01:37.636
Booty. Among friends.

01:37.661 --> 01:39.164
And nobody needs to get feelings involved

01:39.189 --> 01:40.830
or have feelings about it.

01:40.855 --> 01:42.085
- Absolutely.
- Of course.

01:42.835 --> 01:43.851
It's good to hear that, actually.

01:47.695 --> 01:49.804
It's not a given I won't be over, though.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.933
Yeah. I mean, like I said, I...

01:51.958 --> 01:55.336
I might be busy, but if not...

01:55.360 --> 01:56.793
Right.

01:56.818 --> 01:59.155
Sure. Me, too.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:09.800 --> 02:11.754
How many of those are you gonna do?

02:11.779 --> 02:14.080
Got to get all my aggravation...

02:14.105 --> 02:15.955
out of my system before my parents...

02:15.980 --> 02:17.205
give me...

02:17.230 --> 02:18.282
a refill tonight.

02:18.307 --> 02:19.462
Ohh.

02:20.772 --> 02:23.377
Hey.

02:23.762 --> 02:25.542
When I asked for half a shift off today

02:25.567 --> 02:26.930
to have dinner with my folks,

02:26.955 --> 02:29.569
Sullivan was surprisingly chill.

02:29.594 --> 02:30.889
Maybe now is a good time to tell him

02:30.914 --> 02:32.522
you're going out for Medic One.

02:32.547 --> 02:34.049
Look, he does have to sign off on it.

02:34.074 --> 02:36.375
Now, look. I don't care
how chill he is, all right?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.598
Medic One means
no more running into fires.

02:38.623 --> 02:39.813
All right, Sullivan
just stopped treating me

02:39.838 --> 02:41.097
like I was an interloper.

02:41.122 --> 02:42.521
And let's just say that,
if I want him to sign off,

02:42.546 --> 02:44.570
I'm gonna have to
catch him a really good mood.

02:44.595 --> 02:46.132
Fellas.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.223
Warren. You look tense.

02:54.248 --> 02:56.838
Hm? No. N-No. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

02:56.863 --> 02:59.176
I'm just, uh... just curling.

02:59.177 --> 03:01.165
You know what always helps me loosen up?

03:06.850 --> 03:08.423
1, 2. Ha, ha!

03:08.448 --> 03:09.534
Captain, you know, I, uh...

03:09.559 --> 03:10.784
1, 2, hook!

03:10.809 --> 03:12.312
Yeah, I know.
I used to do this every day.

03:12.337 --> 03:13.979
Hands up.

03:14.004 --> 03:15.541
There we go.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.543
- I can tell, you know. So, what changed?
- Come on.

03:19.652 --> 03:20.843
Aah!

03:20.868 --> 03:22.405
Oh, damn! I'm sorry, man.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.760
Are you all right?

03:23.785 --> 03:25.877
Yeah. You're a little rusty.

03:25.902 --> 03:28.516
I haven't had anyone
to spar with in a while.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.461
But you got potential, Warren.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.093
- Good.
- Yeah, you just gotta keep working

03:32.118 --> 03:33.308
on your bobbing and your weaving.

03:36.285 --> 03:38.481
Not sure if you saw,
but your naked-man-friend

03:38.506 --> 03:41.318
just arrived for his monthly
Chiefs' meeting with Sullivan.

03:41.343 --> 03:42.926
- Okay.
- And by naked-man-friend,

03:42.951 --> 03:44.697
I don't mean that he's naked right now.

03:44.722 --> 03:46.838
But he gets naked with you.

03:47.664 --> 03:49.606
So I'm talking about Ripley,
just to be perfectly clear.

03:49.631 --> 03:51.007
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay.
- Okay.

03:51.032 --> 03:52.084
About that...

03:52.109 --> 03:53.368
When I told you about

03:53.393 --> 03:55.264
my naked-man-friend situation...

03:55.289 --> 03:58.070
I know, it was a big leap
for you, trusting me like that,

03:58.070 --> 03:59.816
especially since, you know,

03:59.841 --> 04:02.386
we drifted so far apart
after the skyscraper.

04:02.411 --> 04:05.233
But now it feels like
we've really come full circle,

04:05.258 --> 04:08.671
and I'm just really glad
to have you back, Vic.

04:08.696 --> 04:11.518
Anyway, thanks.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.838
You're welcome.

04:12.863 --> 04:14.261
But what I actually wanted to talk...

04:14.286 --> 04:16.204
I'm sorry. Did that thing just move?

04:16.230 --> 04:17.784
No, it's... it's a bag.

04:17.809 --> 04:19.156
What I wanted to talk to you about was...

04:19.180 --> 04:20.880
Oh, my God.

04:22.342 --> 04:24.608
Okay, so you're just gonna open it?

04:26.647 --> 04:28.497
We should call Animal Control.

04:29.876 --> 04:31.760
- You want gloves? Let me get you...
- Oh, Travis!

04:31.785 --> 04:32.837
Wow.

04:32.862 --> 04:34.716
Okay. That's a baby in a duffel bag.

04:36.382 --> 04:37.677
Hello? Hello?

04:37.702 --> 04:40.212
Did anyone lose a baby in a duffel bag?!

04:42.736 --> 04:44.031
I think this is a Safe Surrender.

04:44.056 --> 04:45.662
Whoever dropped him is long gone.

04:45.687 --> 04:47.120
I've never gotten one of these before.

04:47.145 --> 04:48.197
They're not very common.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.037
Hey, little buddy. We got you now.

04:50.062 --> 04:51.670
Let's get you all checked out.

04:51.695 --> 04:53.892
Whoa, whoa. I-Is that a...

04:53.917 --> 04:55.941
A baby, yeah. Somebody left him for us.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.260
I'm just gonna confirm that he's healthy

04:57.285 --> 04:59.170
and then call DCFS to come take custody.

04:59.195 --> 05:01.531
Okay, good. Good.

05:01.556 --> 05:03.926
Wow. Wow. We don't get many of these.

05:03.951 --> 05:06.218
Aww. Cute little guy.

05:06.243 --> 05:07.989
Yeah? Yeah.

05:08.014 --> 05:09.204
You have any kids, Chief?

05:09.229 --> 05:11.148
Uh, uh, no, Montgomery. I don't.

05:11.173 --> 05:12.989
Uh, I think we should let the Chief go.

05:13.014 --> 05:16.662
So, thank you, Chief. Good to see you.

05:16.663 --> 05:19.623
It is insane what a great
head of hair he has.

05:19.648 --> 05:21.221
I got to go get a thermometer in the rig.

05:21.246 --> 05:23.478
- I'll be right back.
- No, no, no, no.

05:29.509 --> 05:30.596
Why?

05:30.621 --> 05:32.471
So, you really meant it back there,

05:32.496 --> 05:35.006
that you're good with Ryan
doing stuff with other people?

05:35.031 --> 05:36.846
Even though you're also
doing stuff with each other?

05:36.871 --> 05:37.957
We're grown-ups.

05:37.982 --> 05:39.658
We aren't attached
at the hip or anything.

05:39.683 --> 05:41.880
I think we're both clear on that.

05:41.905 --> 05:43.859
So, then, if you weren't doing stuff

05:43.884 --> 05:45.039
with each other at all anymore,

05:45.064 --> 05:46.811
you'd probably be even more good

05:46.836 --> 05:48.304
if he was doing stuff with anyone else?

05:48.329 --> 05:51.289
Oh, hey! Uh, do either
of you guys want a baby?

05:51.314 --> 05:52.609
- Oh. Did... Did we get a...
- Yeah.

05:52.634 --> 05:53.894
Safe Surrender. Keep walking

05:53.919 --> 05:55.040
or we'll get stuck on baby duty.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.186
- Want a... baby?
- No, no.

05:56.211 --> 05:58.882
- Go, go, go.
- Maya. M... You...

06:01.627 --> 06:03.292
We need to talk.

06:06.117 --> 06:07.690
I don't do things behind peoples' backs.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.044
What happened between us the other day...

06:09.069 --> 06:12.247
it can never happen again.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.118
Okay.

06:14.143 --> 06:15.611
It's a shame, though,
'cause I think we both

06:15.636 --> 06:16.826
had a pretty incredible time.

06:16.851 --> 06:18.653
It's never gonna happen again.

06:19.281 --> 06:21.479
And I'm telling Andy about it.

06:21.504 --> 06:22.729
Cool.

06:22.754 --> 06:24.048
Cool? What do you mean "cool"?

06:24.073 --> 06:25.750
You're not worried about
how she's gonna react?

06:25.775 --> 06:27.590
I mean, maybe I would be if I were you.

06:27.615 --> 06:29.349
But she and I haven't been
anything in a long time, so...

06:29.374 --> 06:30.541
Jack!

06:30.566 --> 06:32.304
Come on, man. It's time to go!

06:32.305 --> 06:33.738
Well, I got to run. Miller's got me

06:33.763 --> 06:34.988
on buffer-duty with his family.

06:35.013 --> 06:36.828
I'm sure she'll be fine.

06:36.853 --> 06:38.044
Wouldn't worry about it.

06:38.069 --> 06:40.161
I'm not worried.

06:40.186 --> 06:41.863
Then kudos.

06:41.888 --> 06:43.946
Try not to miss me too much.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.169
Ugh.

06:49.527 --> 06:51.690
Don't tell Vic I'm in here.
I'm hiding from a baby.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.152
Why would you hide from the baby?

06:53.177 --> 06:54.849
Babies are little, squishy miracles.

06:54.874 --> 06:57.300
- Oh, what happened to you?
- Got punched. By our boss.

06:57.301 --> 06:59.185
You probably just don't have
a way with babies like me.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.332
You know, babies love me.

07:00.357 --> 07:01.685
It's just facts.

07:01.710 --> 07:04.567
I'm not here.
Just dropping this stuff off.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.928
Reggie says it's better to weed
through stuff now

07:06.953 --> 07:08.490
instead of packing it up
and weeding through everything

07:08.515 --> 07:10.470
- at the new place.
- So this is stuff for me?

07:10.495 --> 07:13.005
Oh, yes, it is stuff for you.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
H-Herrera, you wore that?

07:14.905 --> 07:17.171
I mean, this...
it's got sequins and fringe.

07:17.196 --> 07:19.319
Andy wore that in
her first salsa competition.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.309
Say again? You danced, competitively?

07:21.334 --> 07:22.489
- All right, stop.
- What?

07:22.514 --> 07:24.469
Close it up. We are not
looking through this.

07:24.494 --> 07:27.212
Reggie said it'd probably
be tough for you.

07:27.237 --> 07:29.087
Reggie is your real-estate agent.

07:29.112 --> 07:31.309
It's Reggie's job to grease the
wheels to get you to move on.

07:31.334 --> 07:33.254
And Reggie's just angling
for that commission, Dad.

07:33.279 --> 07:34.747
Reggie said that you'd probably say

07:34.772 --> 07:35.927
something like that, too.

07:35.952 --> 07:38.021
My arms hurt.
Can somebody else hold this?

07:38.021 --> 07:39.663
- What is that?
- Andy's childhood in a box.

07:39.688 --> 07:41.781
Did you know she wore bedazzled leotards?

07:41.806 --> 07:43.796
Ooh! Here, here. Hold, please.

07:43.821 --> 07:44.941
- Yeah.
- What?

07:44.966 --> 07:46.122
Here, let me see.

07:46.147 --> 07:48.142
Okay. No, no. Nobody needs to see!

07:48.167 --> 07:49.316
Aww.

07:49.341 --> 07:51.296
Look at how cute you are.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.719
You're owning the monkey bars, girl.

07:52.744 --> 07:54.003
- Why am I holding a baby?
- Is this a letter

07:54.028 --> 07:55.712
from young you to older you?

07:55.737 --> 07:58.298
- I did not come here to hold a baby.
- "Dear Future Andy.

07:58.323 --> 07:59.699
It's me, Not-Future-Andy."

07:59.724 --> 08:01.955
Paws off my memories right...

08:03.620 --> 08:05.427
Sounded like it came from the Barn.

08:15.835 --> 08:16.990
What's going on?

08:17.015 --> 08:18.275
Let's go! Let's go! Move, move, move!

08:24.136 --> 08:25.422
Run a hose! Let's go, move!

08:25.447 --> 08:26.542
Check the driver!

08:26.567 --> 08:28.390
Herrera! Get me a head-to-toe.

08:28.391 --> 08:29.618
And be careful!

08:31.585 --> 08:33.885
Hello? Are you okay in there?

08:33.910 --> 08:35.482
Hello?

08:37.071 --> 08:38.498
I got you.

08:38.523 --> 08:39.893
I'm sorry.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.091
Jump bag.

08:51.516 --> 08:52.858
M-My mom... It's my mom.

08:52.883 --> 08:54.003
She's shaking, and she won't stop!

08:54.004 --> 08:55.940
Guys, another patient in the vehicle!

08:55.941 --> 08:57.409
- Hey, what's your name?
- Ellie.

08:57.434 --> 08:58.555
Ellie, I'm Andy.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.430
- Focus on me, okay?
- We can handle this, 19!

09:00.455 --> 09:02.061
Stay calm, stay deliberate!

09:02.086 --> 09:04.978
Dispatch... an RV has
crashed into Station 19.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.172
It's disabled both ladder-bay
doors and compromised an I-beam.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.291
S-She dropped.
I mean, she was shaking so much.

09:10.292 --> 09:12.489
I didn't know, so I hit the pedal.

09:12.513 --> 09:13.626
I hit it, and then it crashed
through the...

09:13.651 --> 09:15.400
I-It's okay. You probably just hit
the wrong pedal, okay?

09:15.425 --> 09:17.593
Is she okay? Will she...?

09:17.618 --> 09:19.699
Bishop, what's our status in there?

09:19.700 --> 09:21.758
Female, 40s, in an ongoing seizure.

09:21.783 --> 09:23.286
It's a tight squeeze.

09:23.311 --> 09:24.888
Montgomery, can you get
the hydraulic shears?

09:24.888 --> 09:26.217
Disconnecting the batteries,

09:26.242 --> 09:27.571
then unhooking the propane tank next.

09:27.596 --> 09:29.056
- Hughes?
- Copy! On my way.

09:29.081 --> 09:31.391
It sounds like your mom
is still having a seizure,

09:31.416 --> 09:33.683
but they're gonna carry her out
and give her meds.

09:33.708 --> 09:35.624
Hey, talk to me. Does your mom
have a history of epilepsy?

09:35.624 --> 09:37.405
I-I don't think.

09:37.430 --> 09:39.453
God, I've never seen her like this...

09:39.478 --> 09:41.988
- How long since she started seizing?
- A-A few minutes?

09:42.013 --> 09:44.731
- I just kept driving.
- I know you're scared,

09:44.756 --> 09:46.367
but I need to make sure you're okay, too,

09:46.392 --> 09:47.440
and check you out.

09:47.464 --> 09:48.481
Hey, do me a favor.

09:48.506 --> 09:49.973
Scoot to the side over here.

09:51.086 --> 09:52.208
What's happening in there?

09:52.233 --> 09:53.458
The patient's still seizing inside.

09:53.483 --> 09:54.500
We'll have a clear exit in one minute.

09:54.525 --> 09:55.715
Standing by, ready to move.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.647
Okay. Get her out, and get an I.V. in.

09:58.797 --> 10:00.265
Next due Aid Car is a private ambulance.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.962
They're eight minutes out.

10:01.963 --> 10:03.258
We got to keep her steady
for eight minutes.

10:03.283 --> 10:05.237
Yes, sir.

10:13.107 --> 10:15.304
Wow. I thought you were
bougie on a normal day.

10:15.329 --> 10:16.797
Today is not a normal day,

10:16.822 --> 10:18.881
and my family are not normal, either.

10:18.906 --> 10:20.652
They seemed normal on the phone.

10:20.677 --> 10:22.665
They're judgey as hell.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.679
Trust me... you have no idea.

10:24.704 --> 10:26.812
Mm. Yeah, well, judgey parents...

10:26.813 --> 10:28.281
No parents.

10:28.306 --> 10:29.901
I think you're doing okay.

10:31.153 --> 10:33.324
Did you just play the orphan card?

10:37.403 --> 10:39.168
Oh. And, uh, one more thing.

10:39.169 --> 10:42.200
Just no talk about work,

10:42.225 --> 10:43.380
all right?

10:45.420 --> 10:46.853
- Hey, Deano!
- Hey!

10:46.878 --> 10:49.110
There he is. Dad.

10:49.135 --> 10:51.367
Mom. Hello.

10:51.392 --> 10:52.726
- Mm.
- Mm.

10:52.727 --> 10:54.229
Everybody, uh, this is Jack.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.965
Jack, this is my family.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.251
That's my little sister, Yemi...

10:57.276 --> 10:59.300
that's my dad, Bill, and my mom, Ifeya.

10:59.301 --> 11:00.803
It's great to meet you.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.019
And you brought wine?

11:02.044 --> 11:05.213
I'll, uh, whip up a quick sangria.

11:05.238 --> 11:07.682
Oh, you cooked.

11:07.707 --> 11:08.790
Kinda.

11:08.815 --> 11:10.153
I'm impressed.

11:10.863 --> 11:12.679
- Kinda.
- Kinda.

11:12.704 --> 11:14.333
Hey. You missed me?

11:14.803 --> 11:15.888
Yeah. Yeah.

11:20.534 --> 11:21.829
My favorite Camembert.

11:21.854 --> 11:23.565
You remembered.

11:23.590 --> 11:27.141
Son, that's a '93 Cabernet Franc.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.031
It's very cool.

11:29.032 --> 11:30.049
What's that mean?

11:30.073 --> 11:31.576
It means we drink it as is.

11:35.352 --> 11:36.472
What's the update?

11:36.497 --> 11:37.862
She's been seizing at least six minutes.

11:37.887 --> 11:39.667
- Not good.
- Ah, there's too much movement.

11:39.692 --> 11:40.847
I can't place an I.V.

11:40.872 --> 11:42.826
What if we can't get a vein?
What are our options?

11:42.851 --> 11:43.958
Do we use a bone gun?

11:43.983 --> 11:45.917
Only as a last resort.

11:45.942 --> 11:47.284
Injecting meds into bone marrow...

11:47.284 --> 11:49.308
the pain alone from that thing's
enough to knock you out.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.079
I've got cribbing all set.

11:51.104 --> 11:53.406
- All we need is those struts.
- USAR's a minute out.

11:53.407 --> 11:55.395
I hope the walls aren't compromised.

11:57.747 --> 11:59.528
You're a Type 1 diabetic? I'm fine.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.201
I have an automatic
insulin pump. I-It's fine.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.048
Kids at school laugh at it sometimes.

12:05.073 --> 12:06.438
I'm not laughing, just checking.

12:06.463 --> 12:09.077
Yep, 108. Well within normal range.

12:09.102 --> 12:10.847
- W-What about my mom?
- Uh...

12:10.872 --> 12:13.035
Hughes, status update on Paula?

12:13.060 --> 12:14.077
Still in and out of convulsions.

12:14.102 --> 12:15.813
Do you still need more 4x4s over there?

12:15.838 --> 12:17.293
Yeah, when you got a free hand.

12:19.344 --> 12:21.785
Hey. Is she gonna be all right?

12:21.810 --> 12:24.388
We're getting her medicine
to help her feel better.

12:24.413 --> 12:26.090
We'll... We'll know more soon, okay?

12:29.727 --> 12:31.403
All right, everybody hold tight.

12:31.428 --> 12:33.035
Wow, we're doing an EJ?

12:33.060 --> 12:34.285
You sure you can
get that thing in her neck

12:34.310 --> 12:35.534
while she's moving like this?

12:35.559 --> 12:37.479
Gotta try.

12:44.731 --> 12:45.922
Did he get it?

12:45.947 --> 12:47.935
He got it. Pushing midazolam.

12:51.953 --> 12:53.375
Excellent work, Warren.

12:55.148 --> 12:56.963
Our ambulance is gonna
be here any minute.

12:56.988 --> 13:00.659
I saw that you have
Connecticut license plates.

13:00.660 --> 13:01.885
That's a long way away.

13:01.910 --> 13:03.344
3,000 miles so far.

13:03.369 --> 13:04.628
Road trip, huh?

13:04.653 --> 13:05.843
Camping.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.753
My mom said it'd help.

13:07.778 --> 13:09.003
Oh, help?

13:09.028 --> 13:11.468
You know, fresh air.

13:11.493 --> 13:13.447
We saw some deer and birds and whatever.

13:13.472 --> 13:14.732
All right, folks! USAR's here.

13:14.757 --> 13:16.434
Be ready to move when they say move!

13:19.896 --> 13:21.712
Right this way, let's go.

13:21.737 --> 13:23.412
I've got a very tall Barn to stabilize.

13:23.437 --> 13:24.732
Chief, how can I be of service?

13:24.757 --> 13:26.051
You're great on baby duty, Herrera.

13:26.076 --> 13:27.267
Thanks.

13:27.292 --> 13:29.454
Watch your step, everybody!
Loose debris everywhere!

13:33.307 --> 13:35.157
Montgomery, help me over here.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.928
Let's set these,

13:36.953 --> 13:38.247
but, uh, watch that beam up there.

13:38.272 --> 13:40.608
- We cannot risk a collapse. Ready?
- Yep.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.829
Nice work.

13:49.854 --> 13:51.010
Quick reflexes.

13:51.035 --> 13:53.995
Must be all that, uh, cycling, right?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.836
Yeah, it's great exercise.

13:55.861 --> 13:58.093
I made Vic bike the lake
with me last week.

13:58.118 --> 14:00.130
She didn't seem to enjoy it as much.

14:01.449 --> 14:02.883
You should join us next time, though.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.364
You know, if... if you want.

14:06.683 --> 14:08.914
You're inviting me to join...

14:08.939 --> 14:10.651
you and Hughes?

14:10.676 --> 14:12.143
Only if you want.

14:12.168 --> 14:14.296
Vic's a beast going down
the descents, by the way.

14:17.793 --> 14:19.990
You're her best friend.

14:20.015 --> 14:22.317
Yes? I mean, I hope so.

14:22.342 --> 14:24.631
So she told you about...

14:25.486 --> 14:26.711
You?

14:29.688 --> 14:31.747
Uh, we need to focus here.

14:31.772 --> 14:34.142
Might need more cribbing on the left.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.670
Copy that.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.073
Yemi, how's law school?

14:43.098 --> 14:45.012
Ongoing.

14:45.037 --> 14:46.819
Her grades slipped last quarter.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.746
To second in my class.

14:49.127 --> 14:52.193
Uh, M-Mom, that is
an antique fire nozzle.

14:52.218 --> 14:53.859
I found a few pieces at the department,

14:53.884 --> 14:55.283
and I restored that one myself.

14:55.308 --> 14:56.765
Wonderful.

14:58.381 --> 15:01.099
Uh, you know,
this is a really great view.

15:01.124 --> 15:02.940
Don't you like Dean's view, Mom?

15:02.965 --> 15:06.655
Looks the same as
the last time I was here.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.530
I am starting to get seasick,

15:08.555 --> 15:10.509
the way this place rocks back and forth.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.557
- Mom, the houseboat doesn't move.
- Well, there must be some movement.

15:12.585 --> 15:15.060
Your mom's got a good
sense of these things.

15:15.085 --> 15:16.866
How is she getting seasick?

15:16.891 --> 15:19.192
You know, if
there's a crack in your armor,

15:19.217 --> 15:20.789
if there's anything

15:20.814 --> 15:22.005
she can criticize,

15:22.030 --> 15:24.258
sooner or later, she'll find it.

15:24.259 --> 15:26.491
Yeah, but the... the house
is moored to the dock.

15:26.516 --> 15:27.637
Yeah, I...

15:27.662 --> 15:28.818
You're the one who invited her.

15:28.843 --> 15:30.623
So how about you explain that to her?

15:30.648 --> 15:32.915
Because I'm not touching it.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.789
Can you smile like this for me?

15:39.814 --> 15:42.290
Just want to make sure your
braces didn't cut your gums.

15:42.315 --> 15:44.326
You know I had braces for four years?

15:44.326 --> 15:45.689
The worst.

15:45.714 --> 15:47.252
I couldn't eat anything.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.058
My dad just used it as an excuse

15:49.083 --> 15:51.523
to confiscate my Halloween candy.

15:51.548 --> 15:53.061
My dad's...

15:53.653 --> 15:54.913
gone.

15:54.938 --> 15:57.308
Oh. Sorry.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.843
My mom and dad told me
to practice saying it out loud.

15:59.868 --> 16:02.388
"My parents are getting a divorce."

16:02.413 --> 16:03.916
I-It's stupid.

16:03.941 --> 16:05.408
It's not stupid, Ellie.

16:05.433 --> 16:08.360
Hi, Rainier EMT. Is this our patient?

16:08.385 --> 16:09.678
Ellie...

16:09.703 --> 16:11.484
She stabilized about three minutes ago.

16:11.509 --> 16:12.665
Hasn't regained consciousness.

16:12.690 --> 16:14.019
Okay. We'll transport her.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.894
Whoa.

16:15.919 --> 16:18.081
Epi of midazolam!

16:18.106 --> 16:20.026
Lowering the gurney!

16:20.051 --> 16:22.282
- W-What's wrong?
- It's just another seizure.

16:22.307 --> 16:23.637
I-I want to see her!

16:23.662 --> 16:24.681
You can't right now, Ellie.

16:24.706 --> 16:26.345
Please, they... they need to treat her.

16:26.370 --> 16:28.116
Midazolam's not working.

16:28.141 --> 16:30.026
Help her!

16:31.266 --> 16:32.614
Whoa, no! No, whoa, no, no!

16:32.639 --> 16:34.928
Mom! Mom!

16:38.751 --> 16:40.359
- Hey, Ellie!
- No, no, no, no, no!

16:40.384 --> 16:41.487
What's happening to her?!

16:41.512 --> 16:43.345
Earlier, her seizures were
responding to our medication.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.665
- Now...
- Why is this happening?

16:44.690 --> 16:46.088
They'll be able to tell you
more at the hospital.

16:46.113 --> 16:47.616
But seizures have all kinds of causes...

16:47.641 --> 16:49.648
fever, infection, sleep loss, stress...

16:49.673 --> 16:50.850
Ellie, let's let them work.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.686
All I do is stress my mom out.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.386
I can't get the I.V. in.
She's moving too much.

16:54.411 --> 16:56.227
We can't transport her in this state.

16:56.252 --> 16:57.998
She's too unstable. It's too risky.

16:58.023 --> 16:59.163
Are you kidding me?

16:59.188 --> 17:00.568
We'd take her ourselves,
but our doors won't lift up!

17:00.593 --> 17:01.783
I'm sorry. Company policy.

17:01.808 --> 17:03.345
Then we stabilize her here.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.290
- Okay, Ellie, come on.
- No.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.873
- Hughes, take a breather.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

17:12.050 --> 17:13.310
Do we need the bone gun now?

17:13.335 --> 17:14.421
No, no, n-not yet. Not yet.

17:14.445 --> 17:15.707
Just g-give me a couple of minutes.

17:15.732 --> 17:18.031
- Bone gun?
- Y-You see that conference room?

17:18.057 --> 17:19.733
It's a lot quieter up there.

17:19.759 --> 17:21.470
I'm gonna take you up for a sec,
and if they need us,

17:21.494 --> 17:23.032
we'll be able to see, okay?

17:26.320 --> 17:27.685
Ellie.

17:30.557 --> 17:31.886
Okay, okay, thanks.

17:31.911 --> 17:34.663
Hughes! DCFS is coming by
for the little one,

17:34.688 --> 17:36.260
but they have a few calls before us.

17:36.285 --> 17:37.754
- Here.
- Uh, actually, I...

17:37.779 --> 17:40.740
They said to keep him calm and
get him to sleep if possible.

17:40.765 --> 17:43.123
I need someone to call in
more resources from USAR.

17:44.213 --> 17:45.993
Apparently my new mission
is to get this kid to sleep

17:46.018 --> 17:47.799
while there's an RV
crashed into the station.

17:47.824 --> 17:49.917
So today's really the gift that
keeps giving.

17:51.087 --> 17:53.064
Yeah, I better get USAR on the line.

17:56.211 --> 17:57.679
Hey. Where've you been?

17:57.704 --> 17:59.658
- Chief come through here?
- Uh, yeah, you just missed him.

17:59.683 --> 18:01.706
But he ordered you to get
this little guy to sleep...

18:01.731 --> 18:03.165
- Oh.
- ...ASAP.

18:03.190 --> 18:05.144
- Ohh.
- You love babies, right?

18:05.169 --> 18:06.776
Well, it's not that I love babies

18:06.801 --> 18:08.778
so much as babies love me.

18:13.611 --> 18:15.531
First week of business school,
they assigned me

18:15.556 --> 18:17.753
to this international student
from Nigeria...

18:17.778 --> 18:20.010
show her around, help her acclimate.

18:20.035 --> 18:22.441
Not only did she show me
where the library was,

18:22.466 --> 18:23.933
by the end of the day, she convinced me

18:23.958 --> 18:25.843
to change my concentration.

18:25.868 --> 18:27.788
You're much more suited to finance.

18:27.813 --> 18:30.010
And I've been tagging along
with her ever since.

18:30.301 --> 18:31.969
That's a sweet story.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.269
You know, we were 22 then.

18:36.562 --> 18:38.621
You care to un-passive that aggressive?

18:38.646 --> 18:40.044
Dean turned 30 recently.

18:40.069 --> 18:41.330
I've accomplished plenty, Mom.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.246
Certainly. You've done
so much to help strangers.

18:44.271 --> 18:45.902
But when it comes to your family,

18:45.927 --> 18:47.562
you don't give that part
of your life much thought.

18:47.587 --> 18:50.149
- Sweetheart...
- Bill, he's 30

18:50.174 --> 18:51.624
with no real career,

18:51.649 --> 18:53.146
no wife, no kids...

18:53.171 --> 18:54.534
You know, in my eyes,

18:55.348 --> 18:56.711
a-and in most peoples' eyes,

18:56.736 --> 18:57.995
Dean's great at what he does.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.427
A few months ago, we were in that

19:00.452 --> 19:01.921
big skyscraper fire downtown...

19:01.946 --> 19:03.796
Jack, it's not that I object

19:03.821 --> 19:05.722
to firefighting as a profession.

19:05.747 --> 19:08.874
It's a very noble job
for a young man like you

19:08.899 --> 19:12.371
who doesn't have as many options as Dean.

19:15.481 --> 19:17.640
Well, um...

19:18.663 --> 19:21.033
There's no good time to do this,

19:21.058 --> 19:23.688
so I'll just pick the worst one.

19:24.637 --> 19:26.311
I would like to announce...

19:26.336 --> 19:28.526
Mom, Dad...

19:28.920 --> 19:30.306
I'm moving out.

19:31.613 --> 19:32.964
Like Dean.

19:38.413 --> 19:40.496
My mom said we needed a break,

19:41.016 --> 19:42.415
to get away.

19:42.778 --> 19:46.085
This was supposed to be silly
and fun, and now...

19:46.956 --> 19:49.385
Bad things just keep
happening over and over.

19:51.470 --> 19:53.217
I feel like I'm a jinx or something.

19:53.241 --> 19:54.917
Hey, let's... let's think
about something else

19:54.942 --> 19:56.342
for a second, all right?

19:56.366 --> 19:58.285
I got a box of old stuff today.

19:58.310 --> 20:01.051
Maybe there's a-a board game in there.

20:02.407 --> 20:04.188
You... Are you thirsty?

20:04.213 --> 20:05.959
L-Let's go get you some water.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.931
Will they be able to fix her?

20:14.525 --> 20:17.799
I'll bring you some water.
I'll be right back.

20:24.488 --> 20:26.304
It's been almost four minutes, Warren.

20:26.329 --> 20:28.178
30 minutes since she got here.

20:28.203 --> 20:30.783
We need to get her to a hospital now.

20:30.808 --> 20:32.658
All right. Give me the bone gun.

20:32.683 --> 20:35.957
Prep her leg, apply lido...

20:35.982 --> 20:37.692
a lot of lido.

20:37.717 --> 20:39.220
All right, you all know the drill...

20:39.245 --> 20:41.095
we are inserting a metal injection port

20:41.120 --> 20:43.179
straight into her tibia.

20:43.204 --> 20:44.568
She needs phenobarb...

20:44.593 --> 20:46.373
we have only one way to get it to her...

20:46.398 --> 20:49.104
15-gauge needle,
directly into her marrow.

20:51.571 --> 20:54.012
We do this wrong,
her pain will be unbearable.

20:54.037 --> 20:56.246
All right. Ready?

20:56.271 --> 20:57.386
Get in there.

21:00.839 --> 21:02.360
Hold on. Here we go!

21:02.385 --> 21:03.610
Hold her leg steady.

21:03.635 --> 21:05.137
90 degrees...

21:22.862 --> 21:24.956
- The port's set.
- Push phenobarb.

21:30.258 --> 21:32.976
- BP's spiking!
- Hang on. Hang on.

21:39.582 --> 21:42.743
Get her to that ambulance.
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:43.574 --> 21:45.668
Herrera, we're moving. Where's Ellie?

21:45.693 --> 21:47.566
Yeah, let me get her.

21:51.241 --> 21:52.882
Ellie? We're taking your mom now.

21:52.907 --> 21:54.687
Can you unlock the door?

21:55.381 --> 21:57.535
I-I don't want to go.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.653
I-I keep messing things up.

21:59.678 --> 22:01.806
Okay, but I know you're gonna
want to be with your mom

22:01.831 --> 22:03.646
- when she...
- I-I can't go.

22:03.671 --> 22:05.416
E-Everything's dark and...

22:05.417 --> 22:06.641
I can't...

22:06.666 --> 22:08.144
Ellie, unlock the door.

22:09.513 --> 22:10.947
Ellie.

22:10.972 --> 22:12.982
Ellie. Ellie?

22:13.576 --> 22:15.079
Transport Ellie's mom without her!

22:15.104 --> 22:17.128
Hughes, I need a jump bag
up here right now!

22:23.973 --> 22:25.369
Herrera!

22:32.625 --> 22:34.637
It's likely her blood sugar.

22:36.757 --> 22:39.857
Readout still shows the exact
same number as before.

22:39.882 --> 22:41.964
- It could've been damaged in the crash.
- Chip malfunction?

22:41.965 --> 22:44.821
If it was pumping insulin
unregulated since impact,

22:44.846 --> 22:47.530
her blood sugar could be severely low.

22:47.555 --> 22:49.787
She could slip into a diabetic coma.

22:49.812 --> 22:51.786
Prepping D50.

22:51.786 --> 22:54.088
Or if the pump wasn't damaged
and this reading's accurate,

22:54.113 --> 22:55.268
this could be a head injury.

22:55.293 --> 22:57.837
And D50 would be caustic.

22:57.862 --> 22:59.886
Let's check her levels.

22:59.911 --> 23:01.553
Okay.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.164
Ready when you are.

23:08.487 --> 23:09.782
Come on, blood sugar test.

23:09.807 --> 23:10.997
Come on, come on...

23:12.342 --> 23:14.158
Low blood sugar. Go!

23:25.987 --> 23:27.595
Good call on the D50.

23:27.620 --> 23:29.955
What... What happened?

23:29.980 --> 23:33.165
You just had a little scare.
But you're out of the woods.

23:33.165 --> 23:34.981
Good.

23:35.006 --> 23:36.161
I hate camping.

23:36.186 --> 23:38.002
I'll get some orange juice

23:38.027 --> 23:39.322
to help you even out your blood sugar.

23:39.347 --> 23:40.815
It's slightly more fun than an I.V.

23:47.090 --> 23:49.217
Hey, bad news...
kid in there just passed out.

23:49.242 --> 23:51.081
Good news is,
now she's doing great, so...

23:52.610 --> 23:54.448
Just thought you'd want the update.

23:59.068 --> 24:01.497
It's not necessary to update
everyone on everything.

24:02.899 --> 24:04.146
Excuse me?

24:05.804 --> 24:07.445
I had a conversation.

24:07.470 --> 24:08.904
With Montgomery.

24:08.929 --> 24:10.096
Okay.

24:10.121 --> 24:12.770
So, yeah, Travis knows, but it's...

24:12.795 --> 24:14.228
Yeah, but I don't think this is the time.

24:14.589 --> 24:17.087
And it's definitely not the place.

24:21.048 --> 24:22.342
It's bad, isn't it?

24:22.367 --> 24:23.546
It doesn't look good.

24:25.526 --> 24:28.036
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ohh.

24:28.061 --> 24:29.668
Here we go.

24:29.693 --> 24:31.995
You're... You're just going for it.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.175
Yeah.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.849
Okay... Oh, oh.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.481
Mnh!

24:37.506 --> 24:39.981
I'm sorry again. For, uh, punching you.

24:39.981 --> 24:42.282
It's, uh... It's fine, sir.

24:42.307 --> 24:44.887
Uh, wipes?

24:44.912 --> 24:46.380
- Here you go.
- And, uh, hang on.

24:46.405 --> 24:47.942
Now hold that corner down.

24:50.918 --> 24:53.185
I figured by now I'd be good at this.

24:54.357 --> 24:56.312
Have a couple kids.

24:56.890 --> 24:59.504
But, um, it didn't happen.

24:59.529 --> 25:00.650
You never know.

25:00.675 --> 25:02.873
Kids can pop up on you. Diaper cream?

25:02.898 --> 25:04.756
When I fell in love with Miranda,

25:04.756 --> 25:06.745
Tuck just came with the package.

25:06.770 --> 25:08.030
That's a nice bonus.

25:08.055 --> 25:09.488
Yeah.

25:09.513 --> 25:11.785
And I can't imagine my life without him.

25:12.256 --> 25:14.662
Yeah. That's another thing about kids.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.439
Uh, hold that tab down there,
careful, careful.

25:17.464 --> 25:18.584
All right.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.814
Every decision you make,

25:21.839 --> 25:23.631
you think about that kid first.

25:24.027 --> 25:26.328
You think about your family,

25:26.353 --> 25:28.260
what's best for them,

25:29.358 --> 25:30.965
keeps 'em together.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.083
And...

25:33.108 --> 25:34.854
- Aww, yeah.
- Oh, there we go.

25:34.879 --> 25:38.223
There you g... And, oh,
and he's already wet again.

25:38.248 --> 25:40.272
Oh, we're gonna have to
start all over again.

25:40.575 --> 25:43.359
Okay. Let me, uh... Let me find
another clean diaper first.

25:43.665 --> 25:46.591
Hey, Bishop, can you tag in for me here?

25:46.616 --> 25:48.948
Negative, Warren. No babies.

25:50.045 --> 25:52.207
Go ahead. I can take him.

25:52.232 --> 25:54.117
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:58.795 --> 26:01.860
Hi. Oh, hi, baby.

26:02.927 --> 26:04.534
Yeah.

26:04.559 --> 26:06.522
Take a sip. It'll help.

26:06.547 --> 26:09.751
I-I can't do this by myself.

26:10.138 --> 26:12.809
I can't handle this.

26:13.579 --> 26:15.902
You ever steal a plane ticket?

26:17.196 --> 26:20.469
My first detention was in the 6th grade.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.498
My dad had left, out of nowhere,

26:24.523 --> 26:28.039
to help other firefighters in
New York after the towers fell.

26:28.064 --> 26:32.157
So I went alone, and I brought him back.

26:32.529 --> 26:36.359
And I got assigned to write this letter.

26:38.015 --> 26:39.588
"Dear Future Andy.

26:39.613 --> 26:42.401
It's me, Not-Future-Andy.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.067
The plane ride was so scary,

26:44.092 --> 26:46.220
it was shaking a lot in the air."

26:46.245 --> 26:47.296
Were you freaking out?

26:47.321 --> 26:49.284
Oh, yeah.

26:49.309 --> 26:50.708
What's the rest say?

26:50.733 --> 26:53.415
Uh, "But guess what, I'm not
scared of planes anymore.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.604
Here's a list of things I am afraid of.

26:55.629 --> 26:56.922
I bet by the time you read this,

26:56.947 --> 26:58.763
you're not scared of them anymore.

26:58.788 --> 27:00.644
1... being alone.

27:01.898 --> 27:03.678
2... letting people down.

27:03.703 --> 27:07.081
3..." Oh, this is a big one.

27:07.106 --> 27:08.991
"Raccoons."

27:09.016 --> 27:11.560
"4... getting bad grades.

27:11.585 --> 27:13.407
5... losing my best friend.

27:14.642 --> 27:17.036
P.S... Ryan's here. He says hi!"

27:17.685 --> 27:18.954
Who's Ryan?

27:20.115 --> 27:22.821
My, uh... friend.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.152
Uh, you want to talk more

27:26.177 --> 27:28.236
about the stuff
that's scaring you right now?

27:28.261 --> 27:30.215
It might help.

27:33.296 --> 27:34.555
No.

27:34.580 --> 27:36.986
Okay. Well, here's one thing we can do.

27:37.011 --> 27:38.862
We can take another sip of orange juice.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.150
Look around.
Is this how you want to live?

27:45.175 --> 27:47.512
- At your age, we were...
- Hon. Yemi's 25.

27:47.537 --> 27:49.699
By her age, we were married.
You were starting your company.

27:49.724 --> 27:51.262
Yeah, what makes you think at 25

27:51.287 --> 27:52.858
you were an adult and I'm not?

27:52.883 --> 27:54.525
Because you are not.

27:54.550 --> 27:57.338
Do you want us to cut you off
like your brother?

27:57.363 --> 28:00.081
Because all you are doing
is following in his path...

28:00.106 --> 28:02.432
and that is not a path
you want to follow.

28:02.457 --> 28:04.446
Mom! Enough.

28:04.471 --> 28:06.946
You come in here and... and you criticize

28:06.971 --> 28:09.168
everything about me...

28:09.193 --> 28:10.696
my food, my house.

28:10.721 --> 28:12.925
You're... You're even criticizing Jack.

28:13.402 --> 28:15.928
You know he runs into burning
buildings by my side?

28:16.578 --> 28:19.262
Do you know that he saved
my life at that skyscraper fire?

28:19.287 --> 28:21.762
I could've died! You don't!

28:21.787 --> 28:23.359
You don't want to know
any part of my life.

28:23.384 --> 28:25.199
That's it!

28:25.224 --> 28:26.936
Can't you see
you're upsetting your mother?

28:33.486 --> 28:35.985
I would like to talk to my son.

28:37.159 --> 28:38.731
Alone.

28:49.278 --> 28:50.572
Hey. Do me a favor...

28:50.597 --> 28:52.170
Grab a Halligan
and help me unwedge this thing.

28:52.195 --> 28:53.698
- What did you say?
- I said I could use some help.

28:53.723 --> 28:55.259
To Ripley.

28:56.938 --> 28:58.387
Almost nothing, I swear.

28:59.674 --> 29:01.280
This is my fault.

29:01.305 --> 29:03.190
I shouldn't have told you
anything to begin with.

29:03.215 --> 29:04.579
He didn't want anyone here to know.

29:04.604 --> 29:06.107
Yeah, well, I figured as much

29:06.132 --> 29:07.808
when he tried to turn me
to stone with his eyeballs.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.706
This is bad.

29:09.731 --> 29:11.458
What exactly did you tell him?
Word for word.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.812
I don't know. I can't remember.

29:12.837 --> 29:14.999
Oh, well, try to remember.
Ah, it was quick.

29:15.024 --> 29:16.422
Well, this is important,
so why don't you give it a try?

29:16.423 --> 29:19.627
Uh, he kinda just
put two and two together.

29:19.652 --> 29:21.039
Let's go somewhere else.

29:22.488 --> 29:24.754
Hey, nobody touches this
till I come back.

29:24.779 --> 29:26.802
Yeah, let's...

29:30.940 --> 29:32.129
It was...

29:32.535 --> 29:34.698
Ah.

29:34.723 --> 29:37.539
Just checking in. All good here?

29:37.564 --> 29:40.004
Look who finally got him to sleep.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.643
- Yeah.
- Not bad, Captain.

29:57.253 --> 29:59.138
Herrera, get the bravo side!

29:59.163 --> 30:01.047
- Montgomery, charge that line!
- I got him, Captain.

30:01.072 --> 30:03.304
And hit the flare-up, people! Move, move!

30:03.329 --> 30:07.818
I can't talk about firefighting
like it's a job.

30:07.843 --> 30:10.422
It's family, it's friends, it's home...

30:10.447 --> 30:12.436
it's more than any of that.

30:12.461 --> 30:14.832
It's the finest people
that you will ever meet

30:14.857 --> 30:16.846
standing up every day, together,

30:16.871 --> 30:20.052
to try and fix
some of the bad in the world.

30:20.725 --> 30:23.200
And it's not safe, it's not easy,

30:23.225 --> 30:25.040
but when I'm running towards a fire,

30:25.065 --> 30:27.401
my job is my meaning

30:27.426 --> 30:30.630
in a way working for you
just never could be.

30:30.655 --> 30:34.415
And that, it's... it's important.

30:34.440 --> 30:36.404
I don't just fight fires to piss you off.

30:36.436 --> 30:38.651
Okay, it started out that way,

30:38.676 --> 30:40.700
but now it's... it's more.

30:40.725 --> 30:43.373
It isn't silly that
I want you settled down

30:43.398 --> 30:45.596
with a family of your own.

30:45.621 --> 30:47.228
These things have value.

30:47.253 --> 30:49.138
Yeah, they have value to you.

30:49.162 --> 30:51.881
I worked hard to start my business

30:51.906 --> 30:53.304
and to build a good family.

30:53.329 --> 30:55.457
To make a better way for you.

30:58.204 --> 31:00.262
When I said what I wanted
to do with my life,

31:00.287 --> 31:02.206
so many people told me no.

31:02.231 --> 31:03.665
I kinda know that feeling...

31:03.690 --> 31:06.408
being told that you're doing
the wrong thing with your life.

31:09.488 --> 31:10.713
You and Dad can cut me off...

31:10.738 --> 31:12.062
it's fine.

31:12.787 --> 31:16.130
But don't take your anger at me
out on Yemi.

31:16.155 --> 31:18.456
You gave me plenty of support
when I moved out.

31:18.481 --> 31:21.130
You've got to at least
just give her what you gave me.

31:21.155 --> 31:23.824
You are trying to negotiate.

31:24.617 --> 31:25.933
With me.

31:27.157 --> 31:28.495
Yes.

31:29.658 --> 31:30.998
Yes, I am.

31:31.812 --> 31:34.426
I bet everybody uses
cutesy-wootsy baby-talk

31:34.451 --> 31:35.695
with you, don't they?

31:35.720 --> 31:37.254
It's kinda condescending, huh?

31:37.279 --> 31:38.574
I mean, they don't need
to infantilize you...

31:38.599 --> 31:40.090
you're already an infant.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.486
You're probably wondering
what that loud noise was.

31:43.511 --> 31:45.569
You see, Baby, adding
an additional propane tank

31:45.594 --> 31:47.062
underneath the sink in your RV

31:47.087 --> 31:49.666
is not only against
manufacturer's recommendations,

31:49.691 --> 31:51.090
but it's highly dangerous.

31:51.115 --> 31:52.375
Because you could crash into, say,

31:52.400 --> 31:55.084
a fire station and
cause an undetectable leak.

31:55.109 --> 31:58.692
And then any number of things
could easily set off a spark

31:58.764 --> 32:01.064
and become an ignition source.

32:01.089 --> 32:03.469
Unfortunate? Yes.
Hard to predict? You bet.

32:03.494 --> 32:07.176
But that is fire science.

32:07.569 --> 32:09.828
Oh.

32:10.546 --> 32:11.897
Oh, that bear?

32:14.061 --> 32:15.391
We take those on calls,

32:15.416 --> 32:17.578
give them to little kids
when they get scared.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.558
But you don't need a teddy bear, Baby!

32:19.583 --> 32:21.006
You're tough.

32:26.032 --> 32:27.368
I'm sorry, Baby. I need to take this.

32:27.393 --> 32:29.555
Gibson, you are missing

32:29.580 --> 32:31.708
the craziest shift of all time.

32:31.733 --> 32:34.093
Yeah, things are pretty weird here, too.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.648
So I figure, why not make it weirder?

32:39.644 --> 32:41.911
What if I don't want to pretend
it never happened?

32:41.936 --> 32:45.174
And what if I want to keep
my friendship with Andy intact?

32:45.713 --> 32:47.945
So, what... you don't want to tell her?

32:47.970 --> 32:50.272
I was, then I talked to you,
and you got me worried.

32:50.297 --> 32:52.037
And now I'm starting to think
it's not a great idea.

32:52.410 --> 32:53.982
Look, I know how I come across.

32:54.007 --> 32:58.079
You know, people meet me
and they underestimate me...

32:58.104 --> 33:00.170
it's been happening all night tonight.

33:01.362 --> 33:04.299
But I-I don't really care.

33:05.031 --> 33:07.923
Because I know I'm always
gonna be true to myself.

33:07.955 --> 33:09.492
I don't get why you and I are pretending

33:09.517 --> 33:10.673
for the sake of other people.

33:10.698 --> 33:11.889
Why can't we just be adults

33:11.914 --> 33:14.351
instead of sneaking around?

33:15.173 --> 33:17.648
Because if this happens again,
if... if we happen again...

33:17.673 --> 33:19.245
- We won't.
- We could.

33:19.270 --> 33:21.294
I have to go. I have a baby.

33:26.313 --> 33:28.162
Why would he think
it's gonna happen again?

33:29.342 --> 33:31.727
Okay, fine. I think
it might happen again, too.

33:31.728 --> 33:33.508
But I don't want to hurt Andy.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.002
Eh, he's her secret

33:35.027 --> 33:38.427
ex-boyfriend/ almost fiancé/Gibson.

33:39.809 --> 33:42.249
Ugh. You're right.

33:42.274 --> 33:44.200
I just need to tell her.

33:44.225 --> 33:47.050
You know, you make
a very valid point, Baby.

33:48.149 --> 33:49.761
You're kind of the perfect listener.

33:50.929 --> 33:52.764
What if this happens again?

33:53.423 --> 33:55.829
What if it's me and my mom
and she has another seizure?

33:55.854 --> 33:58.120
You'll get help.
I mean, you got help today.

33:58.145 --> 34:00.313
By wrecking your whole fire station.

34:01.137 --> 34:03.080
It worked out okay.

34:05.688 --> 34:07.737
My mom always takes care of me.

34:09.491 --> 34:11.793
What if she needs me
to take care of her now?

34:12.231 --> 34:13.340
Then you will.

34:14.233 --> 34:17.322
And I think you'll be great at it.

34:31.076 --> 34:32.579
Think they'll let me drive?

34:32.603 --> 34:33.967
Not a chance.

34:38.407 --> 34:40.036
I said I was sorry!

34:41.023 --> 34:42.873
It's Travis. H...

34:42.899 --> 34:44.226
He's a big part of my life,

34:44.252 --> 34:45.304
just like this is a part of my life!

34:45.329 --> 34:47.860
You talked about this in the workplace.

34:50.016 --> 34:51.822
Okay. It's only Montgomery you told?

34:56.148 --> 34:57.997
- Gibson also knows.
- Oh, Vic.

34:58.022 --> 34:59.526
No one was supposed to know.

34:59.951 --> 35:01.662
- Why are you saying it like that?
- Like what?

35:01.687 --> 35:03.621
- Like you're ashamed of me?
- I'm not ashamed of you.

35:03.646 --> 35:05.114
- Well, that's how it sounds.
- Look, if that were true,

35:05.139 --> 35:06.780
why would I keep taking
these risks to be with you?

35:06.805 --> 35:08.676
- Oh, oh. What... Risk?
- We are both taking risks.

35:08.701 --> 35:10.620
Which is why you should know better.

35:10.645 --> 35:12.425
The consequences... not just for me,

35:12.450 --> 35:14.509
but for the both of us...
if we're exposed...

35:14.534 --> 35:16.264
Exposed?

35:17.496 --> 35:20.110
- I'm sorry. Did we commit a crime?
- We violated policy.

35:20.135 --> 35:22.687
So now you're having
second thoughts? After.

35:23.504 --> 35:25.317
You know, you're the boss,
and you create the policy?

35:25.318 --> 35:26.543
Yeah, I kept quiet, and you couldn't,

35:26.567 --> 35:28.140
and now I have to answer for it
to your peers.

35:28.165 --> 35:30.085
- They're my friends.
- They're my subordinates!

35:33.112 --> 35:34.366
Okay.

35:36.257 --> 35:37.482
Okay.

35:39.896 --> 35:41.456
And that's how it is.

35:43.531 --> 35:44.999
As your subordinate, it sounds to me

35:45.024 --> 35:47.430
like this conversation needs to end.

35:51.705 --> 35:53.134
Is that right, sir?

35:55.475 --> 35:57.498
Is this conversation over?

36:02.340 --> 36:04.954
I'm gonna go before I say
something I can't take back.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.510
Yeah, it's just
some minor abrasions here.

36:12.535 --> 36:13.656
Sorry, this, uh, might sting a bit.

36:24.074 --> 36:25.625
Come on, Warren.

36:26.626 --> 36:27.753
What's on your mind?

36:27.778 --> 36:31.086
Oh, um...

36:32.340 --> 36:34.342
Uh, Medic One.

36:34.930 --> 36:36.746
Medic One. I'm, uh...

36:36.771 --> 36:39.389
I'm considering...

36:40.694 --> 36:42.371
going for it.

36:42.396 --> 36:43.690
Uh, and I-I-I know

36:43.715 --> 36:48.470
it's another jump to another job, again.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.628
Well, our patient today
wouldn't have pulled through

36:54.653 --> 36:55.971
without you being here.

37:01.493 --> 37:03.505
Much as I'd like to...

37:06.146 --> 37:07.371
...I can't hold you back

37:07.396 --> 37:09.373
after seeing what you're capable of.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.427
You got my support.

37:17.886 --> 37:19.145
And like you said,

37:19.170 --> 37:21.056
you gotta do whatever
it takes for your family.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.521
Um... thank you, sir.

37:28.470 --> 37:30.181
Rest up.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.639
Next time, we're kickboxing.

37:40.364 --> 37:42.422
Hi. I'm Rachel Del Río,

37:42.447 --> 37:44.367
Department of Children
and Family Services.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.895
Thanks for waiting.

37:46.313 --> 37:48.284
Is that the lil' booboo?

37:48.309 --> 37:50.749
Yep. This is the male infant.

37:50.774 --> 37:53.806
Hi. You're such a widdle cutie-bear!

37:54.410 --> 37:56.091
Yes, you are.

37:56.116 --> 37:59.333
- So, what happens next? Will he be okay?
- Yeah.

37:59.358 --> 38:02.284
I've got some amazing families
on my radar.

38:02.309 --> 38:04.750
Huh? You're gonna be just fine.

38:04.775 --> 38:06.017
Mm-hmm.

38:06.206 --> 38:08.195
Well, you guys had a wild day here.

38:08.220 --> 38:09.618
Do you, uh, want to say bye-bye?

38:09.643 --> 38:11.633
- Oh, yeah.
- Say bye-bye.

38:11.658 --> 38:13.229
Bye, kid.

38:13.254 --> 38:15.032
See you later! Bye-bye.

38:17.072 --> 38:18.817
Take care, all right?

38:18.842 --> 38:19.998
Aww.

38:20.023 --> 38:22.220
He was my first diaper change.

38:22.245 --> 38:23.505
Nailed it.

38:23.530 --> 38:24.651
Okay.

38:24.676 --> 38:26.596
He didn't like me very much,
but that's okay.

38:26.621 --> 38:27.741
- I don't hold grudges.
- Mm.

38:27.766 --> 38:30.792
All right. Uh, well, thanks again, guys.

38:32.947 --> 38:34.102
Wait!

38:37.390 --> 38:39.517
It was really great meeting you.

38:39.542 --> 38:40.906
Good luck with everything.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.373
She's funny.

38:52.398 --> 38:54.804
Was it just me, or was Mom
extra intense tonight?

38:55.056 --> 38:56.559
She's been weird lately.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.319
All the more reason I have to move out.

38:58.344 --> 38:59.916
- Don't worry about the move.
- Oh, I'm not.

38:59.941 --> 39:01.166
I can support myself.

39:01.191 --> 39:02.764
Yeah, I know, but I talked to Mom.

39:03.101 --> 39:05.459
She's gonna throw you
the same support she gave me.

39:05.484 --> 39:06.511
Fair's fair.

39:06.536 --> 39:07.935
Why would she do that?

39:08.723 --> 39:11.506
We may have made a little...

39:11.531 --> 39:13.277
agreement.

39:13.302 --> 39:14.568
It's no big deal.

39:14.593 --> 39:16.396
I may just have to go on a few dates.

39:18.567 --> 39:20.660
- Dates?
- Yeah. Dates, okay?

39:20.685 --> 39:22.743
Dates with eligible women.

39:22.768 --> 39:23.855
Of her choosing.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.626
Oh, my God.

39:25.651 --> 39:26.668
Why would you do that?

39:26.693 --> 39:28.537
She's a great negotiator.

39:28.562 --> 39:29.995
That makes everything totally worth it.

39:30.020 --> 39:32.738
God, I can't wait to see
what happens at our next dinner.

39:36.132 --> 39:38.398
- Uh, more dinners?
- Oh, yeah.

39:38.423 --> 39:40.620
You are an honorary Miller now.

39:50.439 --> 39:51.941
Door's open!

39:51.966 --> 39:53.296
- Hello?
- Reggie?

39:54.606 --> 39:56.734
- I didn't expect you.
- Sorry to barge in.

39:56.759 --> 39:59.188
I brought boxes... the good kind.

39:59.213 --> 40:01.991
- Champagne... the, mm, medium-good kind.
- Mmm.

40:02.016 --> 40:04.116
You have to celebrate closing.

40:04.141 --> 40:05.895
And I got the skinny

40:05.920 --> 40:07.727
On all your new neighbors.

40:07.752 --> 40:10.141
Two doors down, there's a v...

40:10.166 --> 40:12.053
What's the matter?

40:12.078 --> 40:14.379
Nothing. I'm great. I just can't decide

40:14.404 --> 40:16.184
what to do with this mug.

40:16.209 --> 40:18.095
Keep it. Give it away.

40:18.120 --> 40:19.470
You're feeling overwhelmed.

40:19.495 --> 40:20.970
A few months ago, I was sick.

40:20.995 --> 40:23.783
A few weeks ago, I was Interim Captain.

40:23.808 --> 40:26.741
And a few days ago, I was a homeowner.

40:27.621 --> 40:28.706
And now...

40:28.731 --> 40:30.194
And now, you have me here.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.236
To help.

40:31.261 --> 40:32.521
Starting with that mug.

40:40.740 --> 40:42.416
It's a lot, I know.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.951
That's what the champagne's for.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.011
Hold on. Let me grab my mug.

40:50.366 --> 40:51.730
You never stop growing up.

40:51.755 --> 40:53.536
Whoa!

40:55.977 --> 40:58.266
You grow every time you face
a new challenge...

40:58.266 --> 40:59.769
That was a monster shift,

40:59.794 --> 41:01.296
without even leaving the station.

41:01.321 --> 41:02.686
How much further is this place?

41:02.711 --> 41:04.179
I need a drink, and I need it now.

41:04.204 --> 41:05.984
...or an old fear.

41:06.009 --> 41:07.200
You brought your letter?

41:07.225 --> 41:08.899
Yeah.

41:08.924 --> 41:12.582
There's something about it
I just can't shake or something.

41:12.607 --> 41:14.214
With every heartbreak...

41:14.239 --> 41:16.165
My phone says this place
should be right here.

41:16.484 --> 41:17.848
I need it to be right here.

41:19.245 --> 41:21.407
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

41:21.432 --> 41:23.560
Montgomery, you're buying.

41:23.585 --> 41:25.088
It's the least you can do.

41:25.113 --> 41:26.928
Okay, but no scotch.

41:26.953 --> 41:28.248
It tastes like smoke-dirt.

41:28.273 --> 41:30.852
...you grow braver, tougher, more honest.

41:30.877 --> 41:33.074
Hey, so, before we go in...

41:33.099 --> 41:35.053
I know. You... You want me
to put the letter away.

41:35.078 --> 41:38.838
It's funny how something I
haven't thought about in years

41:38.863 --> 41:40.921
is suddenly all I can think about now.

41:40.946 --> 41:42.657
Well, sometimes we can't always control

41:42.682 --> 41:44.518
the things we can't stop...

41:44.543 --> 41:45.920
thinking about.

41:46.279 --> 41:47.504
You wanna know something crazy?

41:47.529 --> 41:50.699
I wrote about Ryan. Even way back then.

41:50.724 --> 41:52.886
- Weird, right?
- That's...

41:54.669 --> 41:56.576
- Weird.
- I don't know, maybe something

41:56.576 --> 42:00.286
aren't meant to change, like maybe
we are suppose to have constance

42:00.303 --> 42:03.663
and maybe, Ryans is one of mine.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.282
Hey Ryan!

42:05.282 --> 42:07.563
And just when you think
you're all grown up,

42:07.564 --> 42:09.564
you make that break through.

42:09.587 --> 42:11.587
Andy Hi.

42:13.421 --> 42:16.242
This is Jenna. Jenna this is my...

42:16.267 --> 42:18.251
friend Andy.

42:20.549 --> 42:21.883
Hi.

42:21.884 --> 42:23.884
You hit another wall.
