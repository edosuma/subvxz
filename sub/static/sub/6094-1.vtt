01:06.089 --> 01:08.091
Honey, you sent in all the
deposit checks, right?

01:08.150 --> 01:09.552
Yeah, I think so.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.000
What do you mean,
you think so?

01:12.750 --> 01:14.650
I mean--what? I mean,
I sent a lot of checks.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.950
I think I sent them all.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.602
The--the wedding
cake check?

01:17.811 --> 01:18.603
Sent it.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.605
Ok, the photographer?
Sent it.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.607
Ok, the hotel
for my parents?

01:22.774 --> 01:24.067
Sent it.
The band?

01:24.067 --> 01:25.610
Brought that one
to them, yeah.

01:25.694 --> 01:26.611
Ok?
Yeah.

01:26.611 --> 01:28.613
The tent and judge.
Judge townsend.

01:28.613 --> 01:31.074
Uh, honey, the tent?
I don't know about that.

01:31.533 --> 01:33.576
You forgot
the tent check?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.120
I th--

01:35.120 --> 01:37.580
Why? Why would-- why did you
forget the tent check?

01:37.914 --> 01:39.124
Why? I forgot.
I forgot.

01:39.332 --> 01:41.126
You can't play around
with these tent people.

01:41.126 --> 01:43.128
You can't. You can't
play around with them.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.129
I know. I've been
dealing with them,

01:44.129 --> 01:45.588
And believe me,
I'm not playing with them.

01:46.089 --> 01:47.590
Kyle...

01:47.590 --> 01:50.093
I have been doing all of
this by myself, ok?

01:50.093 --> 01:52.095
I know. I have been
busting my ass.

01:52.095 --> 01:54.097
I have done absolutely
everything, everything,

01:54.097 --> 01:56.099
Everything, everything,
everything by myself.

01:56.099 --> 01:57.100
I know.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.101
Ok, everything has
been on my own, ok?

01:58.643 --> 02:01.604
Ok, I've been
doing it all.

02:02.105 --> 02:03.606
I bet
you didn't forget

02:03.606 --> 02:05.108
The bachelor party
checks.

02:05.608 --> 02:09.612
Ok...is that what this--
is that what this is about?

02:10.113 --> 02:10.905
No!

02:11.114 --> 02:12.115
Because we could
talk about it. No!

02:12.115 --> 02:13.116
Let's go over it again.
No, no, no.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.117
No, It's ok.

02:14.117 --> 02:15.618
No, I'm just saying
that I'm sure

02:15.618 --> 02:17.120
That those checks found their
way to the mailbox.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.121
That's all.

02:18.413 --> 02:19.622
I wouldn't know.

02:19.622 --> 02:21.124
It amazes me, you know,
It really amazes me

02:21.624 --> 02:24.127
How you and your little fun bunch
can become so organized

02:24.127 --> 02:25.628
When it comes to
mobilizing to Vegas.

02:25.920 --> 02:27.130
It's not--
It's not me doing it.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.131
It's them
handling it all.

02:28.590 --> 02:31.426
And I'm sure that Boyd is the creative
force behind all of this.

02:31.968 --> 02:34.137
Yeah, Boyd--Boyd's
organizing the whole thing.

02:34.637 --> 02:38.141
Robert Boyd is a big
sack of hot gas.

02:40.852 --> 02:42.645
Robert Boyd.

02:43.104 --> 02:45.648
Tina...great, ok.
Here's the deal--

02:45.648 --> 02:47.650
We're talking 5 guys.

02:47.650 --> 02:50.653
Nice guys, Tina.
My friends.

02:50.653 --> 02:53.114
Yeah. Well,
I'm calling you directly

02:53.114 --> 02:55.617
So you don't have
to go through the agency.

02:55.617 --> 02:58.578
Hey! Could you please
not enter the house?

02:58.578 --> 03:01.164
That's correct.
Cash straight to you.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.625
Could you hold on?

03:03.917 --> 03:06.169
Could you please
wait off the property?

03:06.169 --> 03:07.629
We're just trying
to sneak a peak.

03:08.171 --> 03:10.632
Well, just stay off the property until
I'm off the phone.

03:10.799 --> 03:11.591
Why?

03:12.133 --> 03:14.135
Because that's the way
we do it.

03:14.219 --> 03:15.136
Chop, chop.

03:24.479 --> 03:28.149
So, it's 5 guys,
900 bucks, just dancing.

03:28.149 --> 03:29.651
Anything else is extra.

03:29.651 --> 03:31.069
Are you in?

03:31.069 --> 03:33.655
It's just how I feel. I feel that,
at some point in time,

03:33.655 --> 03:36.157
You're going to have to reevaluate
some of your friendships.

03:36.407 --> 03:38.159
Well...ok.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.620
Specifically--
specifically who?

03:40.703 --> 03:41.663
Charles Moore.

03:42.163 --> 03:43.623
You don't like Moore?

03:43.748 --> 03:45.166
I just don't see him
in the big picture.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.168
Ok...but realize,

03:47.168 --> 03:50.171
I've known him since
the third grade.

03:50.171 --> 03:51.172
Well, he's weird.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.674
He's quiet.

03:52.674 --> 03:53.675
He's weird.

03:53.675 --> 03:55.677
Hon, he just
doesn't talk a lot.

03:55.677 --> 03:57.679
Why? I mean,
is he mildly retarded?

03:57.679 --> 03:59.180
He never speaks!
He's a mechanic.

03:59.681 --> 04:02.183
Well, he's weird, Kyle,
and frankly, I really--

04:02.183 --> 04:03.685
I--I expect more
from you.

04:03.685 --> 04:05.687
Yeah, ok, wh--
you expect more what?

04:06.145 --> 04:08.147
You are going to be
hung over for 3 days,

04:08.690 --> 04:11.150
Like those guys on oprah who--
who get drunk

04:11.150 --> 04:12.694
And have disgusting sex
with prostitutes,

04:13.152 --> 04:14.696
And then they go ahead, and they
just say their vows.

04:14.696 --> 04:16.697
They say their vows
with the stench

04:17.197 --> 04:18.658
Of cheap hotel whore
sex all over them.

04:18.658 --> 04:19.659
That's absurd.
Listen to yourself.

04:20.201 --> 04:21.202
It's Vile, Kyle.
It's not Vile.

04:21.202 --> 04:22.203
I've seen it on television.
I'm not going to--

04:22.662 --> 04:23.496
What do you mean
it's not Vile?!

04:23.663 --> 04:24.664
I'm not going
to marry you

04:25.206 --> 04:26.207
With the cheap smell
of hotel whore sex--

04:26.666 --> 04:28.209
I am not to be
common, Kyle, ok?

04:28.668 --> 04:29.669
I am a creature
like no other.

04:30.211 --> 04:31.671
I know that. I am a creature
like no other.

04:31.671 --> 04:32.714
And I will not--I
will not be common.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.174
Do you understand me?
I got you.

04:34.716 --> 04:36.176
Is that too much to ask, Kyle?
Is it too much to ask?

04:36.718 --> 04:38.177
You won't be common!

04:40.179 --> 04:41.723
Honey, take it.

04:41.723 --> 04:43.725
Are we going to eat,
or am I just going to--

04:43.725 --> 04:45.685
Honey...

04:45.685 --> 04:47.186
Do you love me?

04:47.687 --> 04:49.188
Of course I--
I love you.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.189
Of course I love you.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.232
How much?

04:51.232 --> 04:53.234
I love you
with all my heart.

04:53.234 --> 04:54.736
Kiss me.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.198
Look, it's just
insecurity.

04:59.741 --> 05:02.243
I don't know. She's just
really been stressing.

05:02.744 --> 05:04.746
It's insecurity, nut-gnawing
gut-splitters.

05:05.246 --> 05:06.247
What does that mean?

05:06.748 --> 05:08.249
It means
she's insecure.

05:08.249 --> 05:09.250
About what?

05:09.250 --> 05:10.752
About--

05:10.752 --> 05:12.253
Mike Berkow.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.255
Just a second.
All right, big man.

05:14.422 --> 05:17.258
14.3. Thank you.
17.5.

05:17.717 --> 05:19.761
4-6...29.83...

05:19.761 --> 05:21.262
at 9.

05:21.262 --> 05:22.555
Look at him.

05:23.097 --> 05:24.265
I'm amazed
that the windows

05:24.557 --> 05:25.767
Don't blow out of their
fucking sockets

05:26.267 --> 05:27.226
With all
the ass-puckering rage

05:27.226 --> 05:28.770
In these
soulless lizards.

05:28.770 --> 05:30.772
You know, I just--
I just want her to be happy.

05:30.772 --> 05:32.148
Same alarm clock
every morning,

05:32.774 --> 05:34.275
Same two pops on
the same snooze button.

05:34.484 --> 05:37.362
Same shower, towel, toothbrush,
razor, blazer,

05:37.362 --> 05:39.280
Hair pump, gel spray.
It's a fucking epi--

05:39.280 --> 05:40.281
the beatrice accounts.

05:40.782 --> 05:41.783
It's an epidemic,
Fisher.

05:42.116 --> 05:43.284
You're getting
married, baby bub.

05:43.701 --> 05:45.286
I'm not going to candy coat it.
It just gets worse.

05:45.286 --> 05:46.788
It's an 18-wheel
cement truck

05:46.788 --> 05:49.290
That's going to crush every bone
in your big body.

05:49.290 --> 05:50.833
Well, I'm not breathing
right lately, either.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.377
Course you're not.

05:52.377 --> 05:54.879
I--I just start getting,
like, lightheaded and dizzy,

05:54.879 --> 05:56.339
And then the next
thing I know, I realize

05:56.339 --> 05:57.882
I haven't breathed in, like--in two minutes.
That's because--

05:57.882 --> 06:00.343
Hey, hey, hey-- we're leaving from
my house in 3 hours, ok?

06:00.343 --> 06:01.886
If you want to come, you better get
your numbers in order by then.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.888
All right,
first of all--

06:03.888 --> 06:06.349
No "first of all."
I'm not in a game mood, ok?

06:06.599 --> 06:08.351
We were having
a conversation, ok?

06:08.351 --> 06:09.352
You never said
"excuse me."

06:09.519 --> 06:10.353
I'm sorry.
Fisher, I'm sorry.

06:10.728 --> 06:12.355
That's all right.
We'll be there, Adam.

06:12.689 --> 06:14.399
I know you'll be ready.
Michael--3 hours.

06:14.649 --> 06:15.858
Ok. All right.

06:17.485 --> 06:19.862
Look at that big, blind,
gawky bitch boy.

06:19.862 --> 06:21.406
Well, he's your brother.

06:21.739 --> 06:23.866
Freaks me out, man.
You know that?

06:23.866 --> 06:25.368
Panic junky,
I want to smack him.

06:25.368 --> 06:26.869
I don't
deserve that.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.371
Kyle Fisher.

06:28.621 --> 06:29.872
We've got problems.

06:29.956 --> 06:30.873
Problems?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.375
Seating problems.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.918
Ok, well, uh--

06:33.918 --> 06:36.379
Ok, first they said
it wasunderstood

06:36.379 --> 06:39.382
That we were supposed to have gold-trimmed,
padded seats, right?

06:39.382 --> 06:40.883
And now they're
trying to tell me

06:40.883 --> 06:42.885
That there's some sort
of misunderstanding

06:42.969 --> 06:45.388
And that now we can't
have padded ones!

06:45.388 --> 06:48.391
Ok, so what kind of seats
can we have, then?

06:48.474 --> 06:49.892
Nonpadded ones!

06:49.892 --> 06:52.395
So what do
we do about it?

06:52.395 --> 06:53.896
Well, you're going
to go down there.

06:53.896 --> 06:55.398
Go down to where?

06:55.398 --> 06:56.399
You're going
to go down,

06:56.399 --> 06:57.400
And you're going
to straighten out

06:57.400 --> 06:58.317
Those chair people.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.903
What--honey, I'm going
to Vegas in 3 hours.

07:01.362 --> 07:02.947
I need your help!

07:03.906 --> 07:05.908
I'll call
from the road.

07:06.284 --> 07:07.452
Do you love me?

07:07.785 --> 07:11.456
Do--more than I ever imagined I could
ever love anyone.

07:11.706 --> 07:13.458
Straighten out
these chairs?

07:13.583 --> 07:15.960
Ok, listen, we're
leaving from Adam's.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.422
Why don't you come down
and see me off?

07:19.422 --> 07:20.965
Maybe.

07:20.965 --> 07:24.969
Timmy, Adam junior,
take a good look at this

07:24.969 --> 07:27.430
And notice how clean-cut

07:27.513 --> 07:28.973
And well-behaved
they all appear,

07:29.223 --> 07:32.894
Respectable members
of modern society.

07:33.311 --> 07:34.145
That's us.

07:34.395 --> 07:35.897
Ok, boys...smile.

07:35.897 --> 07:37.398
Smile, dad.
Smile.

07:37.482 --> 07:38.483
Smile!

07:38.733 --> 07:39.901
Hey.
Smile...

07:40.151 --> 07:41.903
Smile, smile...

07:42.403 --> 07:44.322
we're smiling!
And all right.

07:44.405 --> 07:45.406
As you were!

07:46.407 --> 07:47.408
Good-bye.
I love you.

07:47.909 --> 07:48.910
I love you.

07:48.910 --> 07:49.911
Have a really,
really good time.

07:49.911 --> 07:51.412
I'll be back tomorrow.

07:51.412 --> 07:52.955
No,
hey, hey, hey--

07:52.955 --> 07:54.957
No, no, don't let anybody smoke
in the car honey--

07:54.957 --> 07:56.417
Because Adam Junior gets sick, ok?
Ok, I'm--

07:56.417 --> 07:59.337
Did you hear that, Boyd? No smoking.
I'm so serious.

07:59.337 --> 08:01.422
I'll drive. Come on.
Not on your life.

08:02.924 --> 08:05.927
Boyd, do you promise on camera
that you won't smoke?

08:05.927 --> 08:07.428
Uh...I won't smoke.

08:07.428 --> 08:08.930
Good. Thank you.

08:08.930 --> 08:09.931
I'm coming, honey!

08:10.098 --> 08:10.932
Bye, dad.

08:10.932 --> 08:11.933
Don't smoke!

08:11.933 --> 08:12.934
We won't smoke.

08:14.435 --> 08:15.436
Bye!
Bye!

08:15.436 --> 08:16.938
Bye!
Bye! Bye!

08:17.939 --> 08:20.441
Vegas!

08:20.775 --> 08:22.443
All right...

08:22.443 --> 08:25.696
Dog needs a flea bath.
Let's go.

08:34.956 --> 08:38.458
Oh, what if
I bring the wrong thing?

08:38.458 --> 08:39.961
What if I bring
cucumber soup?

08:39.961 --> 08:41.962
Who cares!
You're a fucking moron!

08:41.962 --> 08:43.923
Shut up! It's my
fucking opinion.

08:44.006 --> 08:44.966
It's a stupid
fucking opinion, ok?

08:45.424 --> 08:46.425
Oh, thank you.

08:46.968 --> 08:50.429
You have developed this incredibly
annoying habit of talking just...

08:50.429 --> 08:52.431
For the pleasure of
hearing yourself speak.

08:52.431 --> 08:54.475
Listen, he--Boyd
brought up statistics--

08:54.475 --> 08:55.935
Hey, hey, hey!
Leave me out of this.

08:55.935 --> 08:56.936
The hell I did.

08:56.936 --> 08:57.937
The hell you didn't.
You said--

08:57.937 --> 08:59.480
The hell I did--

08:59.480 --> 09:00.940
You said one out of every two
marriages ends in divorce.

09:01.482 --> 09:02.442
You said it.
- I didn't--

09:02.525 --> 09:03.484
You're an asshole,
Adam.

09:03.484 --> 09:04.485
You're an asshole.

09:04.485 --> 09:05.486
Oh, why am I
an asshole?

09:05.695 --> 09:06.445
Multiple reasons.

09:06.487 --> 09:07.446
Give me one.
No.

09:07.947 --> 09:08.948
Name one reason.
No!

09:08.948 --> 09:10.950
Give me one reason.
I'm not going to give you--

09:11.075 --> 09:11.951
You can't give me a reason.
I don't have to--

09:12.452 --> 09:13.452
Give me one reason.
Give it to me.

09:13.870 --> 09:14.453
Shut up!

09:14.453 --> 09:15.455
I want one reason.

09:15.997 --> 09:16.789
Shut up
for one second.

09:16.998 --> 09:18.458
Give me a reason.
I want a reason.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.001
Shut up!
Shut up!

09:20.459 --> 09:22.461
You're just an asshole.
Live with it.

09:22.879 --> 09:23.963

09:24.297 --> 09:25.965
Yeah, can I speak to whoever's in
charge of chairs?

09:26.465 --> 09:27.467
Can't you wait till
we get back there?

09:27.925 --> 09:28.968
I'll pay you
for the call, ok?

09:29.468 --> 09:30.469
I'm on a monthly
rate, here.

09:30.469 --> 09:31.971
How am I going to tell what call
is your call?

09:32.180 --> 09:32.972
Just use my phone.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.473
Hey, don't
be ridiculous.

09:34.473 --> 09:35.975
No, you're being ridiculous. You're
being a tightwad!

09:35.975 --> 09:37.477
A tightwad, huh?
Yeah!

09:37.477 --> 09:39.979

09:39.979 --> 09:40.980

09:46.986 --> 09:49.488
I'd like to speak to somebody

09:49.655 --> 09:50.948
Hola.
You drive like a jew!

09:51.490 --> 09:52.491
Ah, how does
a jew drive?

09:52.491 --> 09:54.493
4 hours and 15 minutes. I can make
Vegas in 3 and change...

09:54.493 --> 09:55.495
I'm not getting
a ticket.

09:55.995 --> 09:56.996
I'm not going to get
a ticket for you.

09:56.996 --> 09:57.997
You slow-driving
son of a bitch!

09:58.497 --> 09:59.498
Yes? Is this--

09:59.874 --> 10:01.501

10:03.461 --> 10:06.005
We have--you're doing my wedding
with the chairs.

10:06.464 --> 10:07.548
Every car
is passing us.

10:07.548 --> 10:09.008
Yeah, I'll hold.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.051
Hold? You're
going to hold?

10:10.051 --> 10:11.552

10:11.969 --> 10:13.054
You're being a jew!

10:13.054 --> 10:14.555
Please get off

10:14.555 --> 10:16.057
Yes, I'm holding

10:16.557 --> 10:17.892
Don't hold anymore!
Hang up!

10:18.059 --> 10:19.560
It's 45 cents
a minute!

10:20.061 --> 10:22.647
No, I'm not Tony.
I'm holding for Tony.

11:12.154 --> 11:13.072
Hello?

11:13.072 --> 11:14.115
Hi.

11:14.615 --> 11:16.117
Hello?
Hey!

11:16.117 --> 11:17.618
Is it--hello--
baby, is that you?

11:18.119 --> 11:19.120
Hi.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.121
Hi.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.623
Are you calling me from jail?
Not yet.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.126
Hey, did you check out
the chair situation?

11:25.459 --> 11:27.128
What?
What about the chairs?

11:27.378 --> 11:29.588
The chairs?
I made 3 calls--

11:30.089 --> 11:31.132
What? 3 calls?

11:31.382 --> 11:34.635
But I can't stop thinking about
how much I love you.

11:35.136 --> 11:37.638
Well, you should.
Well, I do.

11:37.763 --> 11:39.140
What are you doing?

11:39.140 --> 11:41.642
Oh, just a bit
of organizing.

11:41.642 --> 11:43.102
Are you nesting?

11:43.102 --> 11:45.104
Yeah, I'm nesting.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.648
Go have some fun.

11:47.648 --> 11:49.108
Not too much, ok?

11:49.317 --> 11:50.651
Ok, I'm going to go have fun
with my friends,

11:50.651 --> 11:52.111
But not too much.

12:00.161 --> 12:01.620
And you know
in your heart

12:01.620 --> 12:03.164
That it is
just a matter of time--

12:03.164 --> 12:06.167
All day, bullets flying,
babies are getting shot.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.627
If I'm the king
of Israel, right--

12:08.961 --> 12:09.754
Israel does not
have a king.

12:10.087 --> 12:11.130
What the hell
do they have?

12:11.130 --> 12:13.132
They have a president--
president yahoo.

12:13.341 --> 12:16.135
Ok, I'd say to myself,
"yahoo"...

12:16.135 --> 12:17.136
Hee hee hee.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.262
"Take a look at the map."
Yeah?

12:18.637 --> 12:19.680
"Look what's
all around you.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.641
"People who are wishing
horrible, bad, bad things

12:22.641 --> 12:24.185
For you and your people."

12:25.436 --> 12:27.605
The buck's going
to stop right here, buddy.

12:27.605 --> 12:29.607
Not going to happen
with me.

12:29.690 --> 12:32.109
My kid don't know the 6 fucking
new England states,

12:32.193 --> 12:33.611
He has trouble
with geography,

12:33.778 --> 12:36.614
I'm not going to stick that shit
in his face.

12:36.614 --> 12:38.115
I'm going to help
the little guy, you know?

12:38.532 --> 12:39.116
That's right.

12:39.116 --> 12:40.618
Put him in the car.

12:40.618 --> 12:42.119
Take him to maine
for the lobster dinner.

12:42.286 --> 12:44.121
That's how you teach a kid.
Go skiing in vermont.

12:44.121 --> 12:45.623
That's it.
Take him skiing!

12:45.623 --> 12:47.208
Or Yankee stadium
for a hot dog.

12:47.208 --> 12:48.209
That's the way.
You got to--

12:48.709 --> 12:50.711
I'm just saying, it's not--
you don't stare him down.

12:50.711 --> 12:51.712
No, don't
stare him down.

12:51.712 --> 12:52.713
I'm not going
to do it!

12:53.214 --> 12:55.716
Do not...
eyeball your kids.

12:55.716 --> 12:57.218
That's my point exactly!

12:57.218 --> 12:58.219
What?
What is your point?

12:58.219 --> 12:59.720
Take Mexico!

12:59.720 --> 13:01.722
Think about it.
The mexicans would love it.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.182
They're dying for
a little order down there.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.184
First of all,
you get what I'm saying.

13:05.351 --> 13:06.185
You know exactly
what I'm saying.

13:07.645 --> 13:09.188
Let the Israelis
work it out!

13:10.856 --> 13:12.191
They kind of
all look alike!

13:12.566 --> 13:14.735
The jews
and the Mexicans!

13:14.777 --> 13:17.238
So I think, on a whole,
your average joe mexican's

13:17.238 --> 13:19.198
Going to have less of a problem
getting his head around

13:19.281 --> 13:21.242
The whole fucking assimilation thing!
Am I right?

13:21.659 --> 13:24.703
Yeah!

13:25.121 --> 13:26.247
I mean, I tell mine--

13:26.664 --> 13:28.708
I tell mine
they're little men.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.210
I tell them
that they're strong,

13:31.335 --> 13:33.713
That they
make me feel joy.

13:33.963 --> 13:35.756
I let them know, man.
I mean, I really--

13:35.756 --> 13:39.218
I really let them know
that they are just--

13:39.218 --> 13:41.220
Just as important.
They mean just as much.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.221
You know what I'm saying?
Mm-hmm. Yes.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.223
Just as much, man.
Yes, yes.

13:44.557 --> 13:45.724
And you're
their godfather.

13:45.724 --> 13:46.725
I know,
and I'm honored.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.227
No, no, no,
no, no.

13:48.644 --> 13:49.478
No? I'm not.

13:49.645 --> 13:51.230
No, no, you're
the godfather,

13:51.230 --> 13:53.232
But I'm saying--
what I'm saying is,

13:53.232 --> 13:55.693
If anything
ever happens to me--

13:55.693 --> 13:57.736
Oh, brother,
don't even--yeah.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.738
Don't worry about it.

13:59.738 --> 14:02.741
Becausethatis
the point here, ok?

14:02.741 --> 14:05.244
That is what
I'm driving for.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.247
Because, man,
when the big storm comes

14:08.247 --> 14:10.749
And all the forests
are knocked down

14:10.749 --> 14:12.710
And all the rocks
have fallen away

14:12.710 --> 14:15.254
And--and the leaves
are bare,

14:15.254 --> 14:16.755
What's left?

14:18.257 --> 14:19.758
What is left?

14:21.343 --> 14:23.262
The little trees.

14:24.263 --> 14:28.225
The little fellas
that the storm didn't see.

14:28.559 --> 14:31.770
The tiny, little fellas.
That's where it's--

14:33.272 --> 14:34.773
The stripper's here.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.739
Excellent.

14:42.781 --> 14:43.824
Gentlemen,

14:44.325 --> 14:47.328
This...is tina.

14:47.328 --> 14:48.829
Hey, boys.

14:49.121 --> 14:50.331
Hi.

15:55.938 --> 15:57.439
Fish!

15:57.439 --> 15:58.941
She's all yours,
buddy.

15:58.941 --> 16:02.444
Anything you want, man,
bought and paid.

16:02.444 --> 16:03.946
Whoo!

16:03.946 --> 16:05.948
I can't do it.
I can't do it.

16:05.948 --> 16:07.950
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.056
I'll take a ride.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.083
I didn't jump
the gun, did i?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.085
I feel the vibe. I feel the
vibe a little bit.

17:00.586 --> 17:01.587
I'm Michael.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.634
Did I do
ok out there?

17:06.634 --> 17:07.425
Yeah, you kidding?

17:07.425 --> 17:09.595
I'm just in Vegas
gambling, spending money.

17:09.595 --> 17:10.596
You're so beautiful.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.096
Did you win anything?

17:11.096 --> 17:12.598
Look at this.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.599
Not what
you thought, huh?

17:21.106 --> 17:22.608
Woo! Ha! Ha!

17:22.608 --> 17:23.608
Woo!

17:23.608 --> 17:26.944
Got an awful big hit.

17:26.944 --> 17:30.616
Ok, you do know
it's 500 right?

17:30.616 --> 17:32.618
Yeah, over there,
no problem,

17:32.618 --> 17:34.620
But yeah,
500 of my dollars?

17:34.620 --> 17:35.621
Right.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.122
But I thought--
Boyd didn't pay?

17:37.122 --> 17:38.582
No, Boyd didn't pay.
It's 500.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.125
Straight sex,
nothing kinky.

17:40.584 --> 17:42.586
No, no, I'm not going to use you
as a hand puppet or anything.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.129
I just want to make
sweet love to you

17:44.588 --> 17:46.340
Because you have no idea
what you've gotten into.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.106
Oh, yeah!

18:02.106 --> 18:03.607
Trying to get his legs up,
so he can try to--

18:03.982 --> 18:05.609
See, you didn't think it would be
like this, did you?

18:05.609 --> 18:07.611
You thought I was some punk,
didn't you.

18:07.611 --> 18:09.154
You thought I was
a little punk.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.614
Pumped up! Pumped up!

18:17.121 --> 18:18.122
Good boy.

18:18.122 --> 18:20.624
This isn't work,
is it? Not work.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.129
Look at
the jump he did,

18:25.504 --> 18:26.672
Sticking it in there.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.136
Take it!

18:32.553 --> 18:33.345
Take it!
Take it!

18:36.140 --> 18:38.392
Easy, baby.

18:42.688 --> 18:43.689
Aah!

19:12.718 --> 19:14.720
Cool. Ha ha!

19:18.724 --> 19:21.185
You fucking maniac!

19:29.693 --> 19:31.236
You...

19:51.215 --> 19:52.758
I fucked up.

20:04.269 --> 20:05.729
Oh, my god!

20:08.065 --> 20:08.857
Oh!

20:09.107 --> 20:10.734
Jesus christ!

20:10.734 --> 20:12.236
Don't touch her!
Don't touch her!

20:12.611 --> 20:13.737
Call 9-1-1!

20:13.737 --> 20:15.239
Don't move.

20:15.239 --> 20:18.242
We were playing.
We were playing.

20:18.242 --> 20:19.243
I think she's dead.

20:19.243 --> 20:20.744
How do you
know she's dead?

20:20.911 --> 20:22.704
She's got no
fucking pulse!

20:23.080 --> 20:25.249
Listen, you don't know what the hell
you're doing.

20:25.249 --> 20:26.750
Just get back.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.252
All right, where do you look?
What side of the neck?

20:28.460 --> 20:29.253
Left, left,
left side.

20:29.253 --> 20:30.796
Either side,
you idiot!

20:31.296 --> 20:33.799
I'm calling 9-1-1.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.802
We were playing,
and she bumped her head.

20:37.261 --> 20:38.262
Bumped?! Bumped?!

20:38.262 --> 20:40.264
She's got a fucking spike
in her head!

20:40.472 --> 20:41.265
Adam, wait!
What?

20:41.265 --> 20:43.267
What are you doing?

20:43.267 --> 20:44.268
What do you think
you're doing?

20:44.268 --> 20:45.310
I'm calling
the ambulance!

20:45.811 --> 20:47.312
Just wait one--
wait one second. Ok?

20:47.688 --> 20:48.272
Michael? Michael?

20:48.272 --> 20:49.773
I'll take it out.

20:49.773 --> 20:50.732
I can take it out.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.776
What the fuck
have you done?!

20:52.776 --> 20:54.778
Why are you calling
an ambulance? She's dead.

20:54.778 --> 20:56.738
I'm sorry. Sorry.

20:56.738 --> 20:58.115
Oh, god, just call the police.
No.

20:58.115 --> 20:59.283
Just call 9-1-1.

20:59.283 --> 21:00.284
I slipped.

21:00.284 --> 21:02.286
What did you do,
goddamn it?

21:02.286 --> 21:03.036
Nothing.

21:03.245 --> 21:04.830
What the fuck did you do,
you little shit?!

21:04.830 --> 21:05.789
Get out of here!

21:05.873 --> 21:07.833
All right, all right,
just calm down.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.251
It was
an accident!

21:09.459 --> 21:11.795
Everybody just get a hold of themselves,
all right?

21:11.795 --> 21:14.214
You are a lying deviant!

21:14.298 --> 21:15.257
It was an accident!

21:15.257 --> 21:16.758
Are you sure--
yes, I'm sure!

21:16.758 --> 21:17.759
What were you doing?

21:18.135 --> 21:19.761
The floor was wet,
and so I slipped.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.263
Why was
the floor wet?!

21:21.763 --> 21:22.764
I don't know.

21:22.973 --> 21:23.765
Why, goddamn it?!

21:23.765 --> 21:25.767
Why, you little
fucking pervert?!

21:25.767 --> 21:27.728
Come on, damn it,
take it easy.

21:27.811 --> 21:29.313
You don't
fucking know!

21:29.313 --> 21:30.272
Calm down.

21:30.272 --> 21:33.191
We're not helping anything by losing
our temper.

21:33.317 --> 21:36.737
Let's just get
our heads together. Ok?

21:36.820 --> 21:40.782
Whatever we associate in our nervous system
determines our behavior.

21:40.949 --> 21:45.454
You fucking guys. You fucking guys.
You fucking guys.

21:45.787 --> 21:47.289
You fucking guys!

21:47.664 --> 21:49.249
Now let's just
take a second here,

21:49.333 --> 21:52.294
And take a hold of the situation
and review our options.

21:52.294 --> 21:53.170
We call the police!

21:53.170 --> 21:54.296
Ok, call the police,

21:54.296 --> 21:55.297
That's good.
That's one option.

21:55.297 --> 21:56.298
That is not an option!

21:56.298 --> 21:57.799
This is not
multiple choice here.

21:57.799 --> 21:59.259
Yes, it is!

21:59.259 --> 22:00.260
There are always
options, Adam.

22:00.260 --> 22:01.261
You fucking guys!

22:01.261 --> 22:02.804
We can definitely
call the police.

22:02.804 --> 22:04.264
That's an easy call.

22:04.264 --> 22:06.808
Now, if we call the police,
what happens?

22:06.975 --> 22:08.310
They come up here,

22:08.310 --> 22:09.770
they find a dead prostitute
in the bathroom,

22:09.853 --> 22:11.813
and then they ask us
what happened.

22:12.147 --> 22:12.773
What the hell are you going to
tell them?

22:12.773 --> 22:14.775
You had nothing
to do with it?

22:14.775 --> 22:16.777
You didn't know
she was a prostitute?

22:16.777 --> 22:18.320
I mean, that it was
all Michael here?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.780
Your brother,
by the way.

22:19.780 --> 22:22.783
You don't mess around
with a homicide...

22:22.783 --> 22:24.826
what about the alcohol,
narcotics...

22:25.160 --> 22:27.287
don't tell me
there are no options.

22:27.329 --> 22:28.830
There are always
fucking options.

22:28.830 --> 22:30.290
What is the choice?
What options?

22:37.297 --> 22:39.299
We can bury her
out in the desert.

22:39.299 --> 22:41.301
Oh, sure, why not?

22:41.301 --> 22:43.303
No, no,
he's right, he's right.

22:43.512 --> 22:44.805
He's right.
He's right.

22:44.805 --> 22:46.348
We could take
her up to red rock.

22:46.348 --> 22:47.808
Find some nice
quiet place

22:47.808 --> 22:49.351
and just put her
in the ground.

22:49.518 --> 22:51.353
We can do this. We can get her
out of here.

22:51.353 --> 22:53.355
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

22:53.355 --> 22:54.815
Nobody knows
she's here.

22:54.815 --> 22:57.317
I called her personally.
Nobody knows.

22:57.317 --> 23:00.320
Her blood is
all over the bathroom.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.322
Don't you think we got a little bit of
a dna problem here?

23:02.322 --> 23:04.324
It's a marble floor.
We can clean it up.

23:04.324 --> 23:06.326
They've got us on accessory
to murder, Adam.

23:06.326 --> 23:08.829
It's not accessory, ok?
I didn't do shit.

23:08.829 --> 23:10.330
That's not
the point, Adam.

23:10.330 --> 23:12.833
I mean, the room is
covered with blow,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.335
moore looks like he went at it with
a fucking mountain lion.

23:15.335 --> 23:18.338
I mean, the room looks like the manson family
stayed here a month.

23:18.338 --> 23:21.299
This is a major thin-ice situation
we got here.

23:21.299 --> 23:22.843
I'm getting
married, guys.

23:23.051 --> 23:26.847
I have got a wife, and I've got two boys, ok?
Don't tell me.

23:27.264 --> 23:30.851
Let's just take
a vote, a simple vote.

23:31.351 --> 23:32.853
We got two choices:

23:32.853 --> 23:35.355
one, we clean up
this mess right now,

23:35.355 --> 23:37.357
bury it out
in the desert,

23:37.357 --> 23:38.817
go home,
and never look back.

23:38.817 --> 23:41.820
Or, we can easily
call the police,

23:41.820 --> 23:44.406
roll the dice,
take our chances,

23:44.406 --> 23:47.909
and pray to god that it's only
Michael who falls.

23:47.909 --> 23:51.329
The choices are simple:
it's desert or police.

23:54.916 --> 23:56.918
Desert.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.923
The fucking desert.

24:02.257 --> 24:03.341
Uh-uh.

24:03.341 --> 24:04.426
Fish,

24:04.593 --> 24:09.097
I owe you, bro.
I owe you, man.

24:12.100 --> 24:13.435
Desert.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.441
Nobody knows
she's here.

24:19.941 --> 24:23.278
Oh, god...
oh, god.

24:33.455 --> 24:35.624
How do we get her
out of here?

24:41.463 --> 24:43.465
We can wrap her up
in blankets,

24:43.465 --> 24:46.468
bring the car around to the back
of the hotel,

24:46.468 --> 24:48.470
lower her gently down
off the balcony,

24:48.470 --> 24:50.472
put her in the car.
We're done.

24:50.472 --> 24:52.474
Jesus christ,
have you done this before?

24:55.477 --> 24:58.480
The reality is, you take away the horror
of the situation,

24:58.480 --> 25:00.482
take away the tragedy
of the death,

25:00.482 --> 25:03.485
take away the moral
and ethical implications

25:03.485 --> 25:06.488
of all the crap that you've had
conditioned and beaten

25:06.488 --> 25:08.490
into your head
since grade one,

25:08.490 --> 25:09.991
what are we left with?

25:09.991 --> 25:11.493
What?

25:11.827 --> 25:14.454
It's
a 105-pound problem.

25:14.454 --> 25:18.959
105 pounds that's got to be moved from
point "a" to point "b."

25:19.459 --> 25:23.004
Now, a straight line is the shortest distance
between two points,

25:23.004 --> 25:25.966
but we're denied the luxury of a
visible straight line,

25:25.966 --> 25:28.510
but that line exists,
and I see it.

25:28.510 --> 25:29.928
I see that line.

25:30.971 --> 25:33.515
Trust me.

25:33.515 --> 25:34.975
Adam, trust me.

25:39.980 --> 25:42.983
Hotel security. Could you please
open the door?

25:43.358 --> 25:44.484
Oh, fuck.

25:48.655 --> 25:51.491
Hello?
Hotel security.

25:51.491 --> 25:53.493
What do they want?

25:55.495 --> 25:57.455
Shit.

25:58.915 --> 26:00.000
Oh, fuck.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.293
They know.

26:01.501 --> 26:02.294
Calm down.

26:02.502 --> 26:03.461
Hello?

26:03.545 --> 26:05.005
Goddamn it, they know!

26:05.005 --> 26:06.006
Tell them right now!

26:06.506 --> 26:07.507
Just keep
your voice down.

26:10.510 --> 26:11.511
They have cameras
in the ceiling.

26:12.012 --> 26:13.013
Shut up!

26:13.013 --> 26:14.514
Shh-shh.

26:14.681 --> 26:17.517
We don't have time.
Shut up. Shut up.

26:17.517 --> 26:18.518
Shh.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.980
He's gone.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.526
He's gone.

26:32.866 --> 26:34.367
Hello?

26:34.367 --> 26:35.869
Hotel security.

26:37.370 --> 26:39.331
Hi, how are you?

26:39.331 --> 26:41.333
Y'all didn't
hear me knocking?

26:41.708 --> 26:43.835
No,
we heard you.

26:43.919 --> 26:47.339
Mmm, yeah. You guys making a lot of
noise tonight.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.342
What is it,
a toga party?

26:53.845 --> 26:55.847
It's a bachelor party.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.849
Well, y'all going to have to
keep it down.

26:57.849 --> 27:01.853
Well, we will. We will.
We absolutely will.

27:02.395 --> 27:03.855
Listen, we're very, very sorry,
we apologize.

27:03.855 --> 27:05.398
We've been partying
a little hard,

27:05.690 --> 27:08.860
but we're all getting
ready to go to sleep.

27:10.862 --> 27:12.906
Mmm-mmm.

27:15.408 --> 27:17.827
Well, this is going
to be a problem.

27:17.911 --> 27:19.371
Someone's going to
have to pay.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.373
Yeah, we're going to take care of that first
thing in the morning.

27:21.373 --> 27:22.374
Yeah, you will.

27:22.582 --> 27:25.377
What the hell gets
into you people?

27:25.377 --> 27:27.379
Drugs and alcohol.

27:31.925 --> 27:33.385
Well, I got
no problem with that.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.388
Dr. Bigbucks.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.890
Hey,
how about a beer?

27:39.391 --> 27:40.892
No. Maybe
some other time.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.395
Listen, we're very, very sorry,
we apologize.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.896
We didn't mean any
disrespect to the hotel.

27:44.896 --> 27:46.398
We're very sorry.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.358
Hey, hey, don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it at all.

27:48.441 --> 27:49.401
Just as long as
you keep it down.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.905
What the fuck is that?

28:02.122 --> 28:03.957
Sir, please,
before you go in there,

28:03.957 --> 28:05.375
I just want to explain.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.377
Can I talk to you
one second, please?

28:07.377 --> 28:09.379
D-d-don't go
in there yet.

28:09.379 --> 28:11.965
We were calling 9-1-1 right when you came,
I swear to god.

28:11.965 --> 28:13.967
This is not
what it looks like.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.471
Go in there
and put your fucking pants on.

28:18.471 --> 28:20.473
I'm not going to put
my pants back on.

28:20.473 --> 28:22.934
No, you get dressed.
Goddamn it, I'll handle this.

28:22.934 --> 28:24.477
Just get back.
Just get back.

28:24.477 --> 28:26.479
Everybody just get--
just move back.

28:26.479 --> 28:29.441
The floor was wet.
She completely slipped.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.444
Get me a phone.
Just get me a telephone.

28:32.819 --> 28:34.988
Back up, back up!
He wants us to back up.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.990
I want everybody
just to move back.

28:36.990 --> 28:38.450
Just take your
fucking hands off me!

28:45.332 --> 28:47.167
Clear a path!

28:51.504 --> 28:54.507
Don't let him bleed
on the carpet!

28:54.507 --> 28:56.509
Go on! Get out!
Get out!

28:58.011 --> 28:59.012
Shut the door!

29:01.014 --> 29:02.515
Come over here!
Help me!

29:02.515 --> 29:04.017
Jesus! Oh, shit!

29:04.017 --> 29:05.518
Son of a bitch!

29:05.518 --> 29:08.521
He'll bleed out.
He'll bleed out!

29:08.521 --> 29:11.566
Oh, my god!

29:11.566 --> 29:13.068
You motherfuckers!

29:13.068 --> 29:15.570
All right, he'll bleed out.
He'll bleed out.

29:17.572 --> 29:19.574
Oh, die!

29:30.543 --> 29:32.087
Think anybody--

29:33.588 --> 29:34.589
die!

29:35.090 --> 29:36.591
Die, you son
of a bitch!

30:08.581 --> 30:10.083
It's all right.

30:12.669 --> 30:14.087
Come on.

30:15.672 --> 30:17.132
Come on.

30:25.140 --> 30:26.641
Bingo.

30:43.158 --> 30:44.659
New plan.

30:46.661 --> 30:47.662
No, no,

30:47.662 --> 30:48.621
not so much of
a new plan

30:49.164 --> 30:50.165
as a modification
on the old one.

30:50.165 --> 30:51.166
I'm calling the police.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.668
So help me god, you touch that
fucking phone,

30:53.668 --> 30:55.170
I'll bury you
with them.

30:55.170 --> 30:58.173
Surrender is
no longer an option.

30:58.173 --> 31:00.675
I repeat, it is
not an option.

31:00.675 --> 31:04.137
Is there anyone here who does not
understand that?

31:04.137 --> 31:06.681
Little gut check
time, fellas.

31:07.140 --> 31:10.685
Time for some serious
self-exploration.

31:10.685 --> 31:12.187
How do I function?

31:12.687 --> 31:15.190
For real,
no more bullshit.

31:15.190 --> 31:19.194
Can I keep my cool
when they bounce my bananas,

31:19.194 --> 31:23.490
when they won't play my song,
et cetera, et cetera?

31:24.199 --> 31:25.658
You get me?

31:26.075 --> 31:27.202
Do you get me?

31:27.368 --> 31:28.661
Not really, no.

31:29.078 --> 31:31.164
That's not a problem.

31:31.164 --> 31:35.668
Understand not my words,
but follow my orders.

31:36.169 --> 31:40.173
Follow my orders.

31:42.675 --> 31:47.180
Let me be
the success coach.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.362
Wait a minute.

34:49.362 --> 34:50.862
Wait a minute.

34:51.364 --> 34:52.364
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:52.364 --> 34:53.866
What?
We can't do this.

34:53.866 --> 34:55.827
We've already
done this.

34:56.369 --> 34:57.370
No, no, I mean
the suitcases.

34:57.370 --> 34:59.372
We can't bury them like this
in the suitcases.

34:59.372 --> 35:01.374
Why not?

35:01.374 --> 35:04.877
Because it's sacrilegious.

35:04.877 --> 35:06.379
How do you figure?

35:06.838 --> 35:09.340
According to jewish law,
the blood and the limbs

35:09.882 --> 35:13.886
are considered to be a sacred part of
the human spirit.

35:13.886 --> 35:18.349
The body has to be united,
or the soul can't rest in peace.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.392
What the hell? That's what
we're doing.

35:19.892 --> 35:22.395
No, no, it's not. We got their parts
all mixed together.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.397
We can't do this
to them.

35:24.397 --> 35:26.858
She's asian.
They don't have jews in asia.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.401
That is absolutely
not true.

35:28.401 --> 35:31.195
Michael, do they
have jews in asia?

35:31.863 --> 35:32.864
Huh?

35:32.864 --> 35:34.407
They have--
yes, they do.

35:34.407 --> 35:36.909
They have jews in asia.
He is correct.

35:36.909 --> 35:39.370
What the fuck are
we supposed to do?

35:40.913 --> 35:42.915
We're going to have to
open up the suitcases.

35:42.915 --> 35:43.916
We're going to
unpack the bodies

35:44.417 --> 35:45.418
and reunite
the appropriate limbs.

35:45.418 --> 35:46.377
No fucking way!

35:46.836 --> 35:47.670
That's what
we're going to do!

35:47.962 --> 35:48.671
No fucking way!

35:48.671 --> 35:49.505
We have to do this,
goddamn it!

35:49.922 --> 35:51.424
Adam, we got
to get going.

35:51.424 --> 35:52.842
The sun's coming up.
Come on!

35:52.842 --> 35:54.927
I am not flexible
on this.

36:04.937 --> 36:06.981
Let's do it.

36:10.359 --> 36:12.945
I've got her head.

36:14.238 --> 36:15.948
This is her head.

36:15.948 --> 36:17.950
I got a combo situation.

36:18.451 --> 36:19.452
Do you have
any of him?

36:19.452 --> 36:21.454
I have--that's her.

36:23.456 --> 36:25.458
Watch your step,
all right.

36:25.458 --> 36:26.959
Hey! Hey!

36:29.295 --> 36:30.963
I've got a mop.

36:30.963 --> 36:32.965
Just open
the fucking bags up!

36:33.132 --> 36:33.966
Adam, heads up.

36:34.300 --> 36:35.968
Jesus christ!

36:36.094 --> 36:37.970
Don't just toss
it around, goddamn it!

36:38.429 --> 36:39.972
Show a little
fucking respect!

36:40.264 --> 36:42.475
I have her lower leg.

36:42.475 --> 36:45.478
Ok, I have his upper leg
and her lower leg.

36:45.478 --> 36:47.480
I have his upper leg
and her lower ,

36:47.939 --> 36:49.482
leg and they don't
go together!

36:49.482 --> 36:50.942
How do we
get started, Adam?

36:50.942 --> 36:52.944
Look, if you don't want to do it,
just sit the fuck down!

36:52.944 --> 36:55.571
Great fucking idea!
Everybody's losing their goddamned minds!

36:55.947 --> 36:56.948
Is this her stuff here?

36:56.948 --> 36:58.449
That's her!
That's him!

36:58.449 --> 36:59.450
All right,
let's do this.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.995
All right, somebody get his torso,
find his torso.

37:02.995 --> 37:04.455
Forget the head,
we'll just start.

37:04.455 --> 37:05.998
We got the head.

37:05.998 --> 37:09.001
We'll start with black, then we'll go
to the asian, all right?

37:09.001 --> 37:10.002
We're going to
make you very happy.

37:10.461 --> 37:11.462
Ok, you don't
do nothing.

37:11.963 --> 37:12.964
I got toes!

37:12.964 --> 37:13.965
Ok, relax.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.300
I got toes.
I have somebody's toes.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.483
Ok?

37:37.488 --> 37:39.490
All right.

37:56.465 --> 37:59.510
Allow me to be
the first to say

37:59.510 --> 38:04.015
that what we have done here
is not a good thing.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.517
It's clearly not
a good thing,

38:06.517 --> 38:09.979
but it was, given the circumstances,
the smart play.

38:12.982 --> 38:14.984
I'm proud of us.

38:16.527 --> 38:21.032
I am proud of each
and every one of us.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.034
It's going
to be ok.

38:26.495 --> 38:29.498
We performed
under the most complex

38:29.498 --> 38:32.043
and nerve-shattering
of situations.

38:32.043 --> 38:36.505
I mean, each one of us stood fast,
and we all delivered.

38:36.505 --> 38:39.008
I feel proud.

38:39.550 --> 38:42.011
We're going to hell...

38:42.011 --> 38:45.556
hell or prison,
whichever comes first.

38:45.556 --> 38:48.559
That's wrong.
That is flat-out wrong, Adam.

38:48.559 --> 38:51.020
You got to change
your associations.

38:51.020 --> 38:53.522
Hell is for cowards,
for hypocrites,

38:53.522 --> 38:58.027
for people who fear to live by the strength
of their own conviction.

38:58.527 --> 38:59.528
Now, this is war!

39:00.071 --> 39:02.531
Given the circumstances
and given the fact

39:02.531 --> 39:05.034
that we are alive
and they are not,

39:05.034 --> 39:07.036
we've all chosen
life over death.

39:07.036 --> 39:09.538
I mean, two wrongs
don't make a right,

39:09.538 --> 39:11.040
so our conviction
and execution

39:11.040 --> 39:13.042
would only mean more death here,
not less.

39:13.042 --> 39:14.543
I don't know, Boyd.

39:14.543 --> 39:18.506
Just seems to me ever since you started
this personal growth,

39:19.006 --> 39:22.051
self-help, power fucking dysfunctional
fucking bullshit,

39:22.218 --> 39:24.553
you are all fucked up
in the head!

39:24.553 --> 39:26.055
Don't even go there.

39:26.555 --> 39:29.058
You don't know what the hell you're
talking about, all right?

39:29.558 --> 39:31.560
Personal strength has
nothing to do with this.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.563
True, it's helped me to unlock energies and see
my options more clearly,

39:34.855 --> 39:37.024
but to give it credit
for all of this

39:37.024 --> 39:39.568
is a little bit more
than they deserve.

39:41.570 --> 39:46.033
Don't you think we ought to
say more words over the bodies?

39:47.076 --> 39:50.079
What kind of words?

39:50.079 --> 39:52.915
Like a...a prayer.

39:55.376 --> 39:57.211
Go ahead.

40:05.886 --> 40:07.888
Dear god...

40:12.435 --> 40:13.894
I don't fucking
know how to pray.

40:13.894 --> 40:15.438
Say what's
on your mind.

40:15.438 --> 40:17.398
Speak from the heart.
Let it flow.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.402
Dear god...

40:23.904 --> 40:24.905
this is pathetic.

40:24.905 --> 40:25.948
You're pathetic.

40:25.948 --> 40:27.950
What did you say?

40:28.409 --> 40:29.368
You're not a team player.

40:29.368 --> 40:30.411
Don't point at me.

40:30.411 --> 40:31.412
You've never been
a team player.

40:31.412 --> 40:32.913
That's why you don't
have any friends.

40:32.913 --> 40:33.914
What are you talking about?
I have friends.

40:34.415 --> 40:35.416
The hell you do.

40:35.416 --> 40:36.417
The hell
I don't.

40:36.417 --> 40:37.918
You have
acquaintances.

40:37.918 --> 40:39.920
Business friends, superficial
golf buddies.

40:39.920 --> 40:40.921
You've always been
a fringe player.

40:41.422 --> 40:42.423
Don't point at me.

40:42.923 --> 40:44.425
You have some serious male-on-male
intimacy problems.

40:44.425 --> 40:45.426
What are you fucking
talking about?

40:45.926 --> 40:46.927
You can't deal
with men!

40:47.261 --> 40:49.388
Guys, maybe now is
not the time for this.

40:49.388 --> 40:50.931
Come on, Fisher,
this is the perfect time.

40:51.390 --> 40:52.933
This is the real time.
We're in the moment.

40:53.434 --> 40:55.436
Adam, your brother
and myself

40:55.436 --> 40:56.937
as well as several
others present

40:57.438 --> 40:58.397
have always felt
that you were

40:58.397 --> 41:02.902
a fully repressed, living-in-major-denial,
lock-down flyboy.

41:04.695 --> 41:06.405
What?

41:06.405 --> 41:08.908
Fire in the hole,
big guy.

41:09.075 --> 41:10.910
What?

41:11.410 --> 41:15.372
Dear god, please forgive us for
what we've done here tonight.

41:15.372 --> 41:16.916
We've lost our way.

41:16.916 --> 41:19.418
Speaking for myself,

41:19.418 --> 41:23.422
I am deeply in love with the woman
I'm about to marry,

41:23.422 --> 41:26.884
and I am very much looking forward
to raising a family

41:26.884 --> 41:28.886
and being a positive
member of society.

41:28.886 --> 41:30.888
We promise,
if you forgive us,

41:31.430 --> 41:33.933
that we will never forget
this tragedy

41:34.433 --> 41:36.435
and we will try
with all our power

41:36.936 --> 41:38.938
to use it as
a daily reminder

41:39.438 --> 41:42.441
that we are on this earth to do
good, not evil.

41:42.942 --> 41:45.945
Let us move from this day forward with
new spirit and purpose.

41:46.445 --> 41:47.947
You have given us
a second chance,

41:48.447 --> 41:49.990
so let us take
that second chance

41:50.449 --> 41:51.992
and use it to fuel
our fires of productivity

41:52.451 --> 41:55.955
so that the spirits of the two people that
we buried here tonight

41:55.955 --> 41:59.458
can forever live on in our good deeds
and positive achievements

41:59.458 --> 42:03.504
that we, from this day forward,
shall make our lives' work.

42:03.504 --> 42:05.965
Thank you, god,
and once again,

42:05.965 --> 42:10.469
please give us your guidance
and your forgiveness. Amen.

43:20.789 --> 43:21.790
Hello?

43:21.957 --> 43:23.250
It's me.

43:23.542 --> 43:24.793
Hey!

43:24.793 --> 43:27.254
I'm on the road.
We're running a little late.

43:27.463 --> 43:29.256
Really? How late?

43:29.465 --> 43:30.758
Um...like an hour.

43:30.758 --> 43:33.344
Honey, did you check
on the chairs?

43:33.677 --> 43:34.345
What?

43:34.345 --> 43:36.764
Did you check on the chairs?
Ok.

43:36.847 --> 43:38.807
Ok what?
What?

43:38.849 --> 43:40.267
What. Yeah.
What about the chairs?

43:40.768 --> 43:42.770
I left a message.
Everything's going to be ok.

43:43.229 --> 43:45.314
Yeah? You sound
a little funny, honey.

43:45.314 --> 43:47.316
Did you do the cocaine
last night?

43:47.775 --> 43:48.817
Um...nope.

43:49.318 --> 43:52.321
I'm gonna be home in, like, 4 hours,
ok, hon?

43:52.613 --> 43:54.323
Did you have fun?

43:54.657 --> 43:55.824
Was it fun, honey?

43:56.158 --> 43:58.327
You think
he had kids?

43:58.327 --> 43:59.828
What?

43:59.995 --> 44:00.829
Children.

44:01.247 --> 44:04.333
Do you think that man
was a father?

44:04.333 --> 44:06.293
I don't know.

44:06.293 --> 44:08.295
I got a really bad
feeling...

44:08.837 --> 44:10.839
that he had children.

44:10.839 --> 44:14.843
I don't know.
I think he was too young to have children.

44:16.345 --> 44:18.347
We're gonna burn
for this.

44:33.362 --> 44:36.323
Come on, guys. Daddy's home.
Let's go. Adam jr.

44:36.323 --> 44:39.326
Where did you go, dad?

44:39.451 --> 44:41.870
Today is the beginning
of the rest of our lives.

44:42.204 --> 44:43.330
Hi, daddy!

44:43.330 --> 44:45.332
Oh...

44:45.624 --> 44:47.334
honey! Honey,
we have to go.

44:47.543 --> 44:49.336
My soccer game's
today.

44:49.545 --> 44:51.338
You were gonna drive me and my friends.
You have to.

44:51.630 --> 44:53.382
Nobody says anything
to anybody...ever.

44:53.716 --> 44:54.383
We're late.

44:54.383 --> 44:55.843
Right?

44:56.135 --> 44:57.594
Let's go.

44:59.388 --> 45:01.390
The idea is to be able to,
like, look at everybody

45:01.390 --> 45:03.350
and know that they're all
in the same wedding, right?

45:03.350 --> 45:05.853
I mean, I just want to make sure that everything's
sort of pressed.

45:05.853 --> 45:08.355
I don't want to look like it's been hanging
on a hanger all the time.

45:08.355 --> 45:10.357
I want everything
to be, like...

45:10.357 --> 45:12.901
I just want them to all look like they're just...
you know, clean.

45:12.901 --> 45:14.903
Here, let me...

45:14.903 --> 45:18.866
let me help-- I'll help you with that.
Your nails are filthy.

45:18.866 --> 45:21.368
I don't care--
like, just for the day,

45:21.368 --> 45:23.871
all I ask is that
they're clean for the day.

45:23.871 --> 45:26.373
After that, I don't care
what happens, ok?

45:26.457 --> 45:27.333
Ok.

45:27.333 --> 45:28.375
Hi, Boyd.
Hey.

45:28.709 --> 45:31.879
Ok, um, basically...
are you gonna stand like this?

45:31.879 --> 45:35.883
I'll stand any way
you would like me to stand.

45:37.593 --> 45:38.886
Michael...

45:39.303 --> 45:40.888
Mike--what is--
what happened here?

45:41.388 --> 45:44.391
He gave me a collar
center because I have an irregular size.

45:44.391 --> 45:45.392
An irreg--

45:45.392 --> 45:48.354
I'm in between sizes.
My neck is wide, and...

45:48.437 --> 45:49.855
this looks like it hurts.
It does.

45:49.855 --> 45:51.398
Does it hurt?
Yeah. I can't really breathe.

45:51.398 --> 45:53.901
Is this your shirt?
Did you bring this, or is this theirs?

45:54.401 --> 45:57.279
It's theirs.
Ok, well, this is just totally unacceptable.

45:57.279 --> 45:59.365
How are you feeling?
Put your arms down.

45:59.365 --> 46:03.118
If you can just take it in on the sides right here...
right here. Right here.

46:08.374 --> 46:11.377
He's got two kids, 
goddamn it, just like I said!

46:11.377 --> 46:12.878
Two fucking kids,
goddamn it!

46:13.420 --> 46:17.883
Calm the fuck down!
Let's move on past the fucking blaming shit.

46:17.883 --> 46:19.426
Ok, now, where'd
you get this?

46:19.426 --> 46:21.428
At the newsstand
on third.

46:21.428 --> 46:23.430
Fucking Boyd,
that fucking idiot!

46:23.430 --> 46:26.392
Goddamn it,
they're onto us! They're not onto us.

46:29.895 --> 46:31.939
Boyd, did you read
the paper?

46:32.314 --> 46:33.399
Is that him? Is that him?
Give me that!

46:33.941 --> 46:34.942
Goddamn it, calm down.

46:34.942 --> 46:38.404
Boyd, you fucking idiot!
This shit is coming down, man!

46:38.862 --> 46:39.905
That's just nothing.

46:39.905 --> 46:42.408
That's just a stupid missing persons thing,
that's all.

46:42.783 --> 46:43.575
You got us into this mess!

46:43.909 --> 46:45.411
I did?
From what I remember,

46:45.411 --> 46:47.413
it was your rat-fuck brother that decided
to play chop suey

46:47.913 --> 46:49.415
with the hooker's
fucking head.

46:49.540 --> 46:50.916
Will you shut up?!
Calm down.

46:50.916 --> 46:53.127
Shut up! These fucking phones aren't secure,
goddamn it!

46:53.377 --> 46:55.921
Just lighten up, would you, please,
Adam? All right?

46:55.921 --> 46:58.424
Just show some character. Walk through
some fucking fear.

46:58.882 --> 46:59.925
Don't talk to me
about character, pal.

47:00.426 --> 47:01.927
Watch the tone,
fella, ok?

47:02.052 --> 47:02.928
Fuck you, Boyd!
Give me the phone.

47:03.387 --> 47:05.931
Fuck you, too, snake-eyes,
cocksucker!

47:05.931 --> 47:07.433
Fuck you!
Shut up. Boyd?

47:07.433 --> 47:09.435
They have my credit card
imprint, you know that?

47:09.435 --> 47:10.936
He hung up, goddamn it!

47:10.936 --> 47:12.938
Fucking asshole!

47:13.021 --> 47:14.440
Fucking...

47:14.440 --> 47:17.526
Look what you did, goddamn it!
Look what you did!

47:17.776 --> 47:21.029
Refocus...your mind!

47:21.196 --> 47:25.534
Control...
your...fear!

47:33.041 --> 47:34.042
Knock it off!

47:34.543 --> 47:36.044
Hey, don't snap at them.

47:36.044 --> 47:37.045
They're making me nuts!

47:37.546 --> 47:38.547
No, they're singing.

47:38.547 --> 47:40.048
It's a disgusting song.

47:40.048 --> 47:41.550
Well, you taught it
to them.

47:42.968 --> 47:44.970
Guys! Guys, be quiet.

47:44.970 --> 47:48.974
Your daddy's in a really, really bad mood,
and if you're really good,

47:49.391 --> 47:51.477
You're gonna get some whizzers--
I promise.

47:51.560 --> 47:52.978
Whizzers!

47:53.061 --> 47:55.606
We want whizzers!
We want whizzers!

47:55.606 --> 47:58.609
Ok? Ok, yeah.
High-five. All right.

47:59.067 --> 48:01.111
We want whizzers!
We want whizzers!

48:01.612 --> 48:03.113
We want whizzers!

48:03.489 --> 48:06.116
We want whizzers!
Whizzers! Whizzers!

48:06.116 --> 48:09.119
Whizzers! Whizzers!
Whizzers! Whizzers!

48:09.119 --> 48:13.123
Whizzers! Whizzers!
Whizzers! Whizzers!

48:13.123 --> 48:15.083
Whizzers! Whizzers!

48:15.083 --> 48:16.627
Whizzers! Whizzers!

48:16.627 --> 48:19.630
Whizzers! Whizzers!
Whizzers!

48:19.713 --> 48:23.133
We want whizzers!
We want whizzers!

48:23.342 --> 48:25.135
We want whizzers!

48:39.733 --> 48:42.152
Hey, how do you like
the minivan?

48:42.402 --> 48:45.155
We want whizzers!
We want whizzers!

48:45.364 --> 48:46.615
We want whizzers!

48:47.074 --> 48:50.160
We want whizzers!
We want whizzers!

48:50.410 --> 48:52.162
We want whizzers!

48:52.454 --> 48:54.665
So, how do you like
your minivan?

48:54.748 --> 48:55.666
Fine.

48:55.666 --> 48:56.667
Whizzers!

48:56.959 --> 48:58.669
We want whizzers!

49:01.672 --> 49:04.675
No, no, honey. Honey, go in there and
get them some whizzers.

49:04.925 --> 49:06.677
What?
They're screaming for whizzers.

49:06.677 --> 49:09.137
Just go in there
and get some whizzers.

49:09.137 --> 49:10.681
I'm not going in there.

49:10.681 --> 49:13.183
They are screaming like monsters.
It's giving me a headache.

49:13.642 --> 49:16.186
I used the credit card so I don't have
to go in there!

49:16.186 --> 49:17.646
Go get them
some fucking whizzers!

49:17.646 --> 49:19.189
Whizzers! Whizzers!
Whizzers!

49:19.314 --> 49:20.649
Whizzers! Whizzers!

49:20.649 --> 49:23.652
Thank you. Go.
Please. Whizzers.

49:23.944 --> 49:25.153
We want whizzers!

49:25.153 --> 49:26.655
Love you!

49:35.706 --> 49:37.165
Fucking whizzers!

49:42.087 --> 49:43.672
Excuse me.

49:45.674 --> 49:48.677
Yeah. Sure.
No--no problem.

49:48.927 --> 49:51.680
Aah! Oh! Aah!

49:51.680 --> 49:53.682
Ooh! Aah! Jeez!

49:54.182 --> 49:56.184
I'm sorry.
I--I got it.

49:56.184 --> 49:58.186
I got it. Sorry!
I'm sorry.

49:58.186 --> 49:59.688
Just leave it.

49:59.896 --> 50:02.190
Leave it
and get out.

50:02.190 --> 50:03.191
I'm--I'm sorry.

50:03.692 --> 50:04.693
Buddy, you ok?

50:04.818 --> 50:05.694
Hey--whoa!

50:05.694 --> 50:09.197
What the hell
is wrong with you?

50:09.197 --> 50:11.199
Just get out!

50:11.199 --> 50:12.200
Yay!

50:12.200 --> 50:14.703
Dad's got the whizzers!
Dad's got the whizzers!

50:14.703 --> 50:17.706
Dad's got the whizzers!
Dad's got the whizzers!

50:17.706 --> 50:19.207
Here he comes!

50:19.374 --> 50:20.709
Where are the whizzers?

50:20.709 --> 50:22.711
They didn't have
any whizzers.

50:22.711 --> 50:24.713
What do you mean, they don't have
any whizzers?

50:24.713 --> 50:26.715
They didn't have any
fucking whizzers, ok?!

50:26.715 --> 50:27.716
What are you doing?!

50:28.133 --> 50:30.177
What is your problem?!
What is your goddamn problem?

50:30.510 --> 50:31.303
Aah!

50:31.678 --> 50:33.221
Dad!

50:37.684 --> 50:39.227
Oh, oh...

50:42.397 --> 50:43.231
nice to see you.

50:43.231 --> 50:44.691
Oh, my god!

50:46.234 --> 50:48.195
You look so beautiful!
I love that dress.

50:48.195 --> 50:50.697
Oh, my god... have you seen amanda?
Oh, my god, come here.

50:50.697 --> 50:53.742
She's wearing the same exact dress she wore
to heidi's wedding.

50:53.742 --> 50:54.743
I'm losing it, fish.

50:55.202 --> 50:56.745
Hey, now--
how's it going?

50:56.745 --> 50:59.206
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you.

50:59.206 --> 51:01.708
I got a migraine like a fucking monkey kicking
in the side of my--

51:01.708 --> 51:04.711
I get you, I get you.
Hi. Hi, cynthia. Nice to see you.

51:04.711 --> 51:06.213
Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Wilshire.

51:06.213 --> 51:07.214
Fish. Fish--

51:07.214 --> 51:09.216
I'm sorry,
I'm not myself.

51:09.216 --> 51:10.717
Just, please, not now.

51:10.717 --> 51:12.219
Where's
the bathroom?

51:12.219 --> 51:13.720
It's just past--
where's the fucking bathroom?!

51:13.720 --> 51:15.222
It's past the bar!
Excuse me.

51:18.934 --> 51:22.270
Here's a picture
of Kyle, age 4,

51:22.771 --> 51:25.774
and his good friend,
jo-jo the mule.

51:26.775 --> 51:28.276
Now...

51:28.568 --> 51:31.279
evidently,
when they got to camp,

51:31.530 --> 51:34.783
Kyle and Boyd over there
had some serious arguments.

51:35.158 --> 51:36.284
Try and get me
in the mouth.

51:36.284 --> 51:37.285
Shh.

51:37.703 --> 51:39.788
...who exactly
was Kyle's best friend,

51:39.996 --> 51:41.790
Boyd or the mule?

51:41.957 --> 51:44.793
Well,
fish had a less than normal relationship

51:45.085 --> 51:46.253
with that ass.

51:47.754 --> 51:50.257
You're
just jealous, Boyd.

51:50.257 --> 51:52.801
Well, be that as it may,

51:53.051 --> 51:55.804
after camp came football,

51:56.304 --> 51:57.764
and for those of you

51:57.764 --> 52:01.226
who didn't follow
the sports pages back in 1977,

52:01.226 --> 52:04.730
you might not remember
the peewee powerhouse of oklahoma,

52:04.730 --> 52:07.816
who, under the leadership
of yours truly,

52:08.400 --> 52:12.821
managed to roll to
an auspicious league record of 0 for 12...

52:13.905 --> 52:18.368
scoring exactly
not one damn touchdown.

52:21.747 --> 52:24.040
Where are you going?

52:24.166 --> 52:25.584
Oh...ho ho!

52:25.584 --> 52:28.587
He was a husky kid then,
and he's a husky kid now...

52:28.962 --> 52:30.881
whose great talent
was persistence.

52:31.047 --> 52:32.591
They showed up.

52:34.050 --> 52:37.554
They didn't score much.
They didn't score at all.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.556
Ha ha! But they showed up.

52:39.848 --> 52:44.060
So...now I'd like
to propose my toast...

52:44.060 --> 52:48.523
to the groom and...
his wonderful bride.

52:49.316 --> 52:50.567
God bless.

52:50.567 --> 52:51.568
God bless.

52:51.568 --> 52:53.069
God bless.

52:54.571 --> 52:56.573
Adam,
what's wrong, man?

52:58.074 --> 53:00.077
I can't--
I can't fucking breathe.

53:00.577 --> 53:01.536
What's wrong?

53:01.536 --> 53:03.080
Fish, I'm sorry.
- Ok!

53:03.080 --> 53:04.539
You're freaking me
out, brother.

53:04.539 --> 53:06.583
That was definitely not cool--definitely
inappropriate behavior.

53:07.083 --> 53:08.084
Just shut up
for a second.

53:08.585 --> 53:10.086
Negative!
This is not what you've worked out

53:10.086 --> 53:11.588
in terms of self-management
here, Adam.

53:11.588 --> 53:13.089
Come on!
Pull it together.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.591
He's having some kind
of problem?

53:14.591 --> 53:16.093
What's the problem,
Adam?

53:16.093 --> 53:18.595
What is the fucking
problem, huh?

53:18.595 --> 53:20.096
Come on.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.599
I just--I just--
we're gonna get caught.

53:22.599 --> 53:24.100
We're not gonna
get caught.

53:24.100 --> 53:25.602
I know we're gonna
get caught.

53:25.602 --> 53:27.104
They're eyeballing
my minivan.

53:27.104 --> 53:28.605
Who?
What?

53:28.897 --> 53:30.148
At the minimart.

53:30.148 --> 53:32.150
What the hell are
you talking about?

53:32.150 --> 53:33.610
They're smoking me out!
Who's smoking you out?

53:33.610 --> 53:35.612
Nobody is
smoking you out!

53:35.612 --> 53:36.613
Shut up!

53:36.613 --> 53:37.614
Kyle!

53:37.614 --> 53:39.157
Yeah? What, hon?

53:39.157 --> 53:40.158
Honey...
yeah?

53:40.158 --> 53:41.618
Is everything ok?

53:41.618 --> 53:43.119
Yeah, everything's fine.
Great.

53:43.620 --> 53:46.122
Ok. Can we go
back inside?

53:46.122 --> 53:47.666
Yeah. Sure.

53:47.666 --> 53:51.127
Honey,now.now.
Can we go inside?

53:51.127 --> 53:53.129
I just have these...
um, we have these...

53:53.129 --> 53:55.632
yeah, we got, uh...
groomsmen's last-minute preparations to make.

53:55.632 --> 53:58.134
We've got a rehearsal
dinner going on inside.

53:58.134 --> 53:59.636
Dad, everything's
fine, ok?

53:59.636 --> 54:01.638
I'm in the middle of my goddamn toast
in there!

54:01.638 --> 54:03.640
Why don't the two of you
go back inside,

54:03.640 --> 54:05.642
you get back into the toast,
and I'll be back in, ok?

54:05.642 --> 54:07.185
So just go on, please.

54:07.185 --> 54:09.646
Honey, we have a rehearsal dinner
here, ok?

54:09.646 --> 54:11.648
Everything's
beautiful. Your wife looks beautiful,

54:11.648 --> 54:13.650
except for what you did to
her fucking nose.

54:13.650 --> 54:16.153
Adam, the timing fucking
sucks on this here.

54:16.153 --> 54:18.155
We got the rehearsal
dinner thing right now.

54:18.155 --> 54:20.156
You never gave
a damn about anyone but yourself.

54:20.156 --> 54:21.658
You're a fucking
reject, ok?

54:21.658 --> 54:23.159
You eat my ass!

54:23.368 --> 54:24.160
Hey!
Eat my ass!

54:24.327 --> 54:25.620
This doesn't help!

54:25.620 --> 54:28.164
If youevertouch
my minivan again,

54:28.164 --> 54:30.167
you are going to be
very sorry, brother!

54:30.667 --> 54:31.668
Very fucking sorry!

54:31.668 --> 54:34.170
You are aloser!
Loser?!

54:34.170 --> 54:36.673
Loser! You're a--
you think your shit's so fucking righteous?

54:36.673 --> 54:39.009
You were right there,
right there with us-- side by fucking side.

54:39.009 --> 54:41.136
You murdered
that girl!

54:41.136 --> 54:43.680
You murdered her!
You're a murderer! Murderer!

54:44.139 --> 54:45.682
Keep it fucking down!
Keep your fucking voice--

54:46.182 --> 54:47.183
shut your fucking mouth.

54:47.183 --> 54:49.185
I didn't do anything, ok?
Yes, you did.

54:49.185 --> 54:51.187
I might just turn your little
pathetic ass in.

54:51.187 --> 54:52.647
How about that, pal?

54:52.647 --> 54:53.648
Did you hear that?

54:54.191 --> 54:55.191
Adam,
calm down, ok?

54:55.650 --> 54:57.652
I'm not gonna calm down!
I can't do this!

54:57.652 --> 54:59.654
I can't do this!
I'm telling you, they--

54:59.654 --> 55:01.656
it won't work!
It cannot work!

55:02.032 --> 55:03.658
Ithasworked!
Itisworking!

55:04.034 --> 55:04.826
It's done!

55:05.160 --> 55:07.162
I'm telling you,
they've got fiber optics,

55:07.162 --> 55:08.163
they've got
dna samples,

55:08.705 --> 55:10.165
they've got
fbi scientists--

55:10.165 --> 55:13.168
the fucking internet,
goddamn it!

55:13.168 --> 55:16.713
They figure this shit
out! They figure it out every fucking time!

55:16.713 --> 55:19.674
They won't figure it out.
You've just got to relax.

55:19.674 --> 55:22.177
I've got children.
I've got a life!

55:22.177 --> 55:24.179
Your kids are one crutch away
from a telethon.

55:24.179 --> 55:25.680
You got a frigid,
swamp-hog wife--

55:26.139 --> 55:27.223
you fuck!

55:27.223 --> 55:29.684
Kyle!
What is going on?!

55:29.684 --> 55:32.229
Jesus! What is--
are they fighting over there?

55:32.229 --> 55:35.190
No, baby--
baby, they are fighting over there!

55:35.190 --> 55:37.692
Now, what the fuck
is--aah! Aah!

55:37.692 --> 55:39.694
Back off, Michael!
That's enough!

55:39.694 --> 55:41.196
Goddamn it,
back off!

55:41.196 --> 55:42.697
You are not going
to ruin this for us!

55:43.198 --> 55:44.699
You will not
ruin it for us!

55:44.699 --> 55:46.701
This is gonna stop.
You fucking go home!

55:46.701 --> 55:47.702
You fucking
murderer!

55:48.203 --> 55:49.204
Back off!
He's gone!

55:49.537 --> 55:51.206
You're a fucking loser!
You're a loser!

55:51.206 --> 55:52.707
You need to take
a time-out.

55:52.999 --> 55:55.210
Go home!
Go home, you fucking murderer!

55:55.210 --> 55:56.211
Fucking loser!

55:56.628 --> 55:58.213
Go home,
you fucking murderer!

55:58.213 --> 56:01.174
Easy, easy! We got to go back in.
We got to go back in.

56:01.174 --> 56:03.176
The problem is gone, ok?
Time out.

56:03.718 --> 56:05.720
Oh, fuck.
We got to get in there.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.223
Listen. We're gonna
go back inside,

56:08.223 --> 56:10.225
we're gonna
collect ourselves.

56:10.725 --> 56:12.686
Adam...are you cool?

56:12.686 --> 56:14.229
No, Boyd.

56:14.688 --> 56:16.231
No!

56:16.231 --> 56:18.692
I am definitely
not cool!

56:20.235 --> 56:22.237
All right,
problem child is leaving.

56:22.696 --> 56:24.239
Back inside, ok?

56:24.698 --> 56:26.241
Just get the fuck
out of here!

56:27.617 --> 56:29.202
Go home, you fuck!

56:31.746 --> 56:33.039
Pull it together.
I got my whole fucking family in there.

56:33.039 --> 56:34.749
Just get it
the fuck over with.

56:48.930 --> 56:50.682
What do you want?!

56:55.729 --> 56:58.231
Mr. Fucking Minivan.

57:00.233 --> 57:01.735
Get the hell
out of here, mike!

57:05.488 --> 57:07.240
He's gonna take out
my minivan!

57:08.241 --> 57:09.242
Don't you dare!

57:09.242 --> 57:11.244
Hey, hey, hey--
my god!

57:12.662 --> 57:14.748
Aah!
Fucking christ!

57:16.249 --> 57:17.751
Oh...

57:18.001 --> 57:19.753
oh...

57:20.086 --> 57:22.756
so it was some sort
of accident?

57:22.756 --> 57:24.758
Yeah. He, uh...
he didn't realize.

57:25.216 --> 57:27.260
I guess he just lost
control of the car.

57:27.260 --> 57:29.262
Was there some sort
of argument?

57:29.554 --> 57:30.764
No, nothing like that.

57:30.972 --> 57:33.266
We heard there was
some arguing going on.

57:33.266 --> 57:35.769
What, some kind of
sibling muscle-flex thing?

57:36.102 --> 57:38.730
No, no, no.
They love each other.

57:39.022 --> 57:42.275
Just, uh...we were all just outside,
just talking.

57:42.692 --> 57:44.277
We were just talking.

57:44.444 --> 57:46.780
What were you
talking about?

57:47.280 --> 57:49.282
Uh, the wedding...

57:49.282 --> 57:50.784
married...wedding...

57:50.992 --> 57:52.786
yeah, how it's probably
going to be the last time

57:53.244 --> 57:55.246
for all of us to be together...
to see each other...

57:55.246 --> 57:57.248
before he gets married.
Married. I'm getting married.

57:57.540 --> 57:59.793
A lot of people seem
to think there was some hostility.

58:00.251 --> 58:01.252
Unh!

58:02.796 --> 58:04.255
How the fuck am i
supposed to comment

58:04.714 --> 58:05.757
on what a lot of other
people thought, huh?

58:05.757 --> 58:07.300
I mean, listen,

58:07.300 --> 58:09.302
we've all suffered an incredible trauma
here,

58:09.302 --> 58:12.305
and we're in full-on
grieving mode right now,

58:12.305 --> 58:14.766
and your questions are just a little bit
poorly timed.

58:15.308 --> 58:17.769
Do you understand?
Thank you very much, officer Randone.

58:17.769 --> 58:18.770
Easy, Boyd.

58:18.770 --> 58:20.772
No "easy Boyd."
Don't give me that shit.

58:20.772 --> 58:23.274
I got a friend in there
in pieces, for god's sakes.

58:23.566 --> 58:25.777
How about a little
sensitivity, huh?

58:27.821 --> 58:31.282
There was no fighting going on or nothing.
Yeah.

58:31.741 --> 58:33.284
Unh, unh, unh!

58:33.368 --> 58:35.787
What was
that guy's name?

58:36.287 --> 58:37.288
Robert Boyd.

58:37.580 --> 58:38.790
Unh, unh, unh!

58:38.915 --> 58:40.792
Excuse me...

58:40.917 --> 58:42.794
his situation
is critical.

58:42.961 --> 58:45.797
He's, uh...asking
to speak to his wife.

58:46.297 --> 58:47.298
Yes?

58:47.715 --> 58:52.262
It's bad. I just want to warn you of what
you're going to see...

58:53.346 --> 58:54.848
unh!

59:13.783 --> 59:17.871
He's in defib.
Gonna have to step away, ma'am.

59:18.121 --> 59:19.873
10 of lidocaine.

59:19.956 --> 59:21.291
Clear.

59:21.374 --> 59:23.293
More blood here.
More blood.

59:23.293 --> 59:25.336
Charge 300. Clear.

59:25.670 --> 59:27.380
Nothing.

59:27.463 --> 59:30.842
He's got nothing left in his heart.
I've got nothing.

59:31.176 --> 59:32.844
I'm gonna call it.

59:32.844 --> 59:34.387
Time of death,
11:58 p.m.

59:34.387 --> 59:36.389
I'm very sorry.
He's dead.

59:36.389 --> 59:37.849
What did he say?

59:37.849 --> 59:39.851
I'm sorry,
he's dead.

59:39.851 --> 59:40.852
What?

59:40.852 --> 59:43.438
You--why are you
walking away?

59:43.438 --> 59:45.773
What are you
walking away for?

59:46.274 --> 59:49.360
What are you
walking away for?

59:52.405 --> 59:54.866
The need to know is clear:

59:54.866 --> 59:58.369
what did Adam tell Lois?

59:58.369 --> 01:00:02.874
That's the name of the game.
What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?

01:00:06.794 --> 01:00:07.795
Yeah.

01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:19.766
I killed my brother.

01:00:25.146 --> 01:00:27.690
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:28.691
All right.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:32.237
I ran my brother down in cold blood.
I ran him down.

01:00:32.445 --> 01:00:34.239
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:35.240
Come on.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.701
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.203
It's time to pay the man.

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:48.628
Goddamn it! It's time
to pay the man!

01:00:48.628 --> 01:00:50.129
Just take it easy!

01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:51.714
It's time to pay!
Take it easy!

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:53.216
Listen to me.
Easy!

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:55.718
You kill one man,
and you're a murderer, ok?

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:58.221
You kill all,
and you are god.

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:00.682
Ok, just take it easy.
I killed my--

01:01:00.682 --> 01:01:02.225
take it--

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.227
you motherfucker!

01:01:04.394 --> 01:01:06.187
Aah!

01:01:06.187 --> 01:01:07.689
Aah! Unh!

01:01:08.189 --> 01:01:09.691
Never!

01:01:09.691 --> 01:01:12.193
The memory of
the just is blessed,

01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:14.195
while the name
of the wicked shallrot!

01:01:14.195 --> 01:01:15.738
Get the--get the car.

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:18.199
The evil that men do lives after us.
You hear me?

01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:19.742
Easy.
Get off me!

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:21.744
Get off me!

01:01:21.744 --> 01:01:24.747
The memory of the just is blessed,
while the name--

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.249
pick him up.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:29.252
It's time to confess your sins!
Confess our sins!

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.254
Keep your voice
down, Michael.

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.755
Open the door!

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:34.340
Just shut your face!

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:35.800
Get in the car!

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.802
Get in there.
Come on!

01:01:37.802 --> 01:01:40.305
The memory of the just
is blessed,

01:01:40.305 --> 01:01:42.807
while the name of
the wicked shall rot!

01:01:42.807 --> 01:01:43.808
Michael! Michael!

01:01:43.808 --> 01:01:45.810
You will control
your conditioned response.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.812
You will pull yourself
together, Mister!

01:01:47.812 --> 01:01:49.772
All right!
Are you hearing me?

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.773
Yes.

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.317
Jesus.
He's cracked up.

01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:55.320
I'm not cracking up!
He is not cracking up!

01:01:57.739 --> 01:01:59.157
What have we done?

01:01:59.574 --> 01:02:01.326
What did you ask me?

01:02:01.826 --> 01:02:03.286
I said,
what have we done?

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.291
Yes, you did. Now,
that is the question.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:11.836
That is exactly the question we should
be asking ourselves.

01:02:11.836 --> 01:02:15.340
"What have we done?"
Why don't you tell us. What have we done?

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.343
I just want to get married.
Exactly!

01:02:18.343 --> 01:02:20.345
Exactly my point.
What's your fucking point?

01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:22.347
I'm not talking
to you, moore.

01:02:22.347 --> 01:02:25.350
What's your point?!
What's your point?!

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:30.313
You want to know
what you're doing here?

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.357
You are love-pumping.

01:02:33.858 --> 01:02:37.320
You are protecting
all that is sacred and beautiful

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.865
and in sync with poetry
and sunsets

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:42.867
and little
newborn babies.

01:02:42.867 --> 01:02:44.827
You're walking the walk.

01:02:45.244 --> 01:02:47.789
This is it, Fisher--
the real stuff.

01:02:47.872 --> 01:02:49.832
You love this woman,

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:54.379
and nothing--
absolutely nothing-- supersedes love, man.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:55.838
Nothing!

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:58.841
I love you,
I love moore, I love Michael.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.843
This car is
full of love!

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:03.846
But trust me,
we will do what it takes--

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.349
whatever it takes.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:20.363
Love does not lose.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.903
Michael. Michael--
oh, Michael...

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:03.364
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:05.908
No, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

01:04:08.369 --> 01:04:10.371
I'll get you
a new minivan.

01:04:10.872 --> 01:04:12.874
Then you can be
the soccer mom.

01:04:12.874 --> 01:04:14.876
You're the soccer Mom!
Steady, boy.

01:04:14.876 --> 01:04:16.878
No, it's not
your fault.

01:04:16.878 --> 01:04:20.423
No--Michael,
watch the nose.
The nose!

01:04:20.506 --> 01:04:21.382
Oh, Michael.

01:04:21.382 --> 01:04:23.384
Michael,
come on, let's go.

01:04:23.384 --> 01:04:24.844
Oh, god. Oh, oh!

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:38.900
I'm sorry!

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.902
I'm sorry!

01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:42.403
I'm sorry!

01:04:42.403 --> 01:04:44.405
Oh! Oh, my god!

01:04:44.405 --> 01:04:45.907
I'm sorry!

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:50.369
Canceled?!

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:51.954
Canceled?

01:04:52.038 --> 01:04:53.456
You're out of
your fucking mind.

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.957
Nobody's talking
about canceling.

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.459
I'm just talking
about modifying.

01:04:56.709 --> 01:04:57.960
No way. No way!

01:04:58.211 --> 01:04:59.462
Can we just
talk it through?

01:04:59.545 --> 01:05:01.964
Talkwhatthrough?
Lookit, lookit...

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:03.466
we are locked and
loaded here, right?

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.926
I mean,
we are nonrefundable.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:08.471
I have family at
the airport as we speak,

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.932
getting ready to come here to see
us get married.

01:05:10.932 --> 01:05:12.975
Do you understand?
I have a table full of presents out there.

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:14.977
Just answer it!

01:05:17.438 --> 01:05:18.439
Hello?

01:05:18.689 --> 01:05:19.982
Kyle, it's Lois.

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:22.985
I was up at Adam's study,
and I found a note.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.987
It seems to be
some sort of confession

01:05:25.363 --> 01:05:28.991
about some horrible
thing he did to a woman in Las Vegas, and...

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.952
buried outside of Vegas, about Boyd
being the ringleader...

01:05:30.952 --> 01:05:32.954
she wants to know what the hell's going on. I'm
starting to freak out.

01:05:33.287 --> 01:05:35.498
We're goosed.
We're not goosed. What's her disposition?

01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:37.500
Regarding what?
Did she sound pissed, scared, hostile?

01:05:37.959 --> 01:05:39.919
Did she say anything
about calling the police?

01:05:40.002 --> 01:05:41.963
No, but she's definitely
pissed and hostile,

01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:43.965
and she clearly is starting to think that
something's not right.

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.967
We're goosed--
goosed by god!

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:48.970
Michael, would you please calm down, all right?
What did you tell her?

01:05:49.178 --> 01:05:51.514
I told her I had no idea
what Adam was talking about in that letter.

01:05:51.597 --> 01:05:53.516
Did she believe you?
I have no idea.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.017
You can tell when people believe you.
It's obvious.

01:05:55.268 --> 01:05:56.519
I don't have that skill,
but if I had to guess,

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.437
I'd say that she
in no way believed me.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:05:59.522
Goosed!
Shut up.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:00.523
Goosed!
Stop it.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:02.024
Goosed!
What's goosed?

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.527
Would you give him another pill?
He's already had two.

01:06:05.027 --> 01:06:06.529
Give him two more.

01:06:06.529 --> 01:06:08.531
We are goosed!

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.533
Open sesame.

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:13.035
Jesus, Boyd, you're gonna o.d. him.
Suck my ass!

01:06:13.035 --> 01:06:14.537
Goosed!

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.539
Hey!

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:17.957
I never
liked you, Boyd.

01:06:17.957 --> 01:06:19.500
You're a sneaky little fuck--
always have been.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.502
What are you
talking about?

01:06:21.627 --> 01:06:22.503
Don't sweet-lip me.

01:06:23.004 --> 01:06:26.007
I don't understand where
this personal attack is coming from.

01:06:26.132 --> 01:06:28.509
You're a liar.
I want to know what happened in Vegas.

01:06:28.759 --> 01:06:29.969
Nothing happened
in Vegas.

01:06:30.511 --> 01:06:32.513
I don't want to hear it
from the liar,

01:06:32.972 --> 01:06:34.974
so stick a plug
in it, Boyd.

01:06:35.182 --> 01:06:37.518
Fisher, what
happened in Vegas?

01:06:42.356 --> 01:06:44.025
Nothing happened
in Vegas.

01:06:44.358 --> 01:06:46.068
Moore?

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.321
Nothing
happened, Lois.

01:06:50.823 --> 01:06:52.074
Michael...

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.833
do you have something
to tell me?

01:07:02.043 --> 01:07:05.046
Michael, just tell Lois
nothing happened in Vegas.

01:07:05.046 --> 01:07:07.048
Shut up, Boyd!
Shut up.

01:07:07.048 --> 01:07:08.591
Michael...

01:07:10.051 --> 01:07:11.510
Michael...

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:14.555
goosed.
What?

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.103
Lois, we were bad.

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:24.565
We were very, very...
we were very, very bad.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:28.069
He's just upset about Adam.
We're all a little upset.

01:07:28.277 --> 01:07:30.571
Michael, Michael, Michael...
what did you do?

01:07:32.198 --> 01:07:33.532
Uh...

01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:45.503
nothing.

01:07:45.503 --> 01:07:47.505
Nothing happened
in Vegas.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.508
All right,
I'll call the police.

01:07:50.508 --> 01:07:52.968
I will call the police
right now

01:07:53.511 --> 01:07:54.970
if I don't start
getting some answers.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.515
Please calm down, Lois.
Fuck you, Boyd.

01:07:57.682 --> 01:07:59.517
Just take it easy, ok?
Enough of this.

01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:01.519
Nothing
happened, Lois.

01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:03.521
Nothing happened. Nothing happened.
Nothing happened.

01:08:03.854 --> 01:08:06.023
I am going to count to 5, and I will
call the police,

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.484
and then we'll find out
what happened. One...

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.485
Goosed!

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.487
Two...
Please don't make
this situation

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:14.031
3...
any more tense than it
has to be, all right?

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.033
4...
Just relax,
would you?

01:08:16.033 --> 01:08:18.035
I am calling
the fucking police!

01:08:18.035 --> 01:08:19.537
Ok, here's the deal!

01:08:25.751 --> 01:08:28.587
Adam slept with
a prostitute in Vegas.

01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:36.970
He was sick
with guilt.

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:47.481
Yeah.

01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:50.484
It's true.
No.

01:08:50.568 --> 01:08:53.487
It wasn't
the first time.

01:08:55.322 --> 01:08:57.450
Adam had a...

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:00.953
Adam had a thing
for...prostitutes.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.962
My Adam?

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:22.433
My Adam? No...

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:24.435
I don't believe it.

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:27.897
I don't believe it.
It's not true.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.899
Not my Adam!

01:09:30.024 --> 01:09:32.443
We're very, very sorry.

01:09:32.568 --> 01:09:33.944
You're lying!

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.946
You're a bunch
of liars!

01:09:36.154 --> 01:09:37.406
I don't believe you!

01:09:37.823 --> 01:09:39.950
Watch your fingers,
watch your toes.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.411
All right, fellas,
I want you to listen to me.

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.412
Now, mommy's going to take
a little time-out,

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.415
and bunker's going to
keep you guys company,

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:49.919
and everything's going
to be ok--I promise.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.921
Ok?

01:09:53.464 --> 01:09:54.924
Ok.

01:09:56.467 --> 01:09:57.468
Take my cell phone.

01:09:57.468 --> 01:09:59.470
After you drop the kids off,
take Michael home.

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:00.930
Put a couple drinks
in him so he'll sleep.

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.431
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:03.933
Just do it.
I'll call you later.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.934
What are you doing?

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:07.853
I'm gonna take care
of business.

01:10:07.853 --> 01:10:08.854
What does that mean?

01:10:08.854 --> 01:10:11.357
What does that mean?
Are you insane?

01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:13.359
Do you actually think
I would hurt Lois?

01:10:13.859 --> 01:10:15.861
She's the mother of these kids,
for christ's sakes.

01:10:15.861 --> 01:10:16.862
What's wrong with you?

01:10:16.862 --> 01:10:19.865
You got a real nasty side
to your thought process.

01:10:21.283 --> 01:10:24.370
Look, I'm sorry. It's
just for tonight.

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:27.373
Lois is a mess,
Michael is upset, everybody's upset.

01:10:27.373 --> 01:10:28.374
Shut up!

01:10:28.707 --> 01:10:29.875
Ok, I am not canceling
this wedding.

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:31.377
I don't want you to.
I won't even discuss it.

01:10:31.377 --> 01:10:32.878
Nobody's
discussing it, ok?

01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:34.880
I'm just gonna bring them back home. I'm
gonna come right back.

01:10:34.964 --> 01:10:36.966
You have to pick up the cake
in the morning, early.

01:10:37.383 --> 01:10:39.969
Don't we have somebody
to do that for us?

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:42.471
Yeah. You.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.473
What...?

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:45.474
Ok. Ok.

01:10:45.891 --> 01:10:46.892
Aah!

01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:50.896
Why did I have to...

01:10:50.896 --> 01:10:53.482
aw, Jesus
fucking Christ!

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:57.236
Evil bastards!

01:10:57.987 --> 01:11:00.489
Aah, you hear
that buzzing, fish?

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:01.490
Buzzing?

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:03.492
Yeah, like a...

01:11:03.492 --> 01:11:06.996
like a fucking chirping
in the back of my skull.

01:11:08.497 --> 01:11:09.999
I don't hear anything.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.002
Yeah, well,
it's a nasty problem.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.503
Deedee? Deedee.

01:11:14.503 --> 01:11:17.506
Boom! Bing, bing, bing.
Bam, bam, bam.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.982
Ahh...

01:11:34.982 --> 01:11:39.486
dad used to bring home these sparklers for me
and Adam, you know?

01:11:40.988 --> 01:11:42.489
Sparklers!

01:11:42.656 --> 01:11:44.491
We'd go out back,
the 3 of us,

01:11:44.658 --> 01:11:46.493
and we'd hold it up
to the sky

01:11:46.493 --> 01:11:48.996
and watch the explosions of light
and sparks, you know,

01:11:48.996 --> 01:11:51.999
and dad would be all,
"wait for it. Here it comes. Watch for it.

01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:54.001
Ok, here it comes.
Here comes the wah-hoo."

01:11:54.168 --> 01:11:55.002
Wah-hoo?

01:11:55.002 --> 01:11:57.504
Wah-hoo! The sparkler
would burn hot,

01:11:57.922 --> 01:11:59.506
then hotter,
then even hotter,

01:12:00.007 --> 01:12:02.009
and then there'd be this
one moment of pure burn

01:12:02.509 --> 01:12:04.511
when that little fucker would cook perfect--
just perfect.

01:12:05.012 --> 01:12:07.514
It would only last a second,
but that second was it.

01:12:07.514 --> 01:12:08.515
It wasit.

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:10.517
And that's what dad had us
looking for, man.

01:12:10.768 --> 01:12:12.519
Are you with me?
The wah-hoo moment?

01:12:12.519 --> 01:12:14.521
That's exactly right.
That's what I'm driving at:

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.024
man burning at
his absolute--

01:12:17.024 --> 01:12:18.525
all the forces
coming together,

01:12:18.525 --> 01:12:21.028
burning just perfect--

01:12:21.028 --> 01:12:22.029
perfect harmony.

01:12:22.029 --> 01:12:23.489
That's what
I'm driving at.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.032
Are you with me?

01:12:25.032 --> 01:12:26.492
I think so.

01:12:26.659 --> 01:12:28.494
I've been looking
for that flash.

01:12:28.494 --> 01:12:30.037
I've been looking,
and I've been looking,

01:12:30.037 --> 01:12:32.039
and I can't find it.

01:12:32.039 --> 01:12:33.499
And what if it already happened,
you know?

01:12:33.499 --> 01:12:34.500
My moment.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.795
What if it happened,
and I didn't even see it?

01:12:43.008 --> 01:12:44.009
Lois?

01:12:45.010 --> 01:12:46.553
Lois?

01:12:46.553 --> 01:12:47.554
Adam...

01:12:47.554 --> 01:12:49.515
no, it's Boyd.

01:12:49.515 --> 01:12:50.933
I just want you
to know

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.935
just how much
I didn't appreciate

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:54.937
that
personal attack.

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:57.940
I'm really offended!

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.984
Uhh! No!

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:05.948
Uhh!

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.952
You picked the wrong woman,
motherfucker!

01:13:10.953 --> 01:13:12.454
Aaaahhhhh!

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:15.916
Auuuuughh god!

01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:17.960
Ahhhhhh!

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.961
Ow!

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.462
It's over, baby.

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:23.966
I'm gonna
turn myself in.

01:13:24.258 --> 01:13:25.467
No.
After the wedding, of course.

01:13:25.759 --> 01:13:27.469
After the wedding,
out of respect.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.971
I don't think that's a good
idea--

01:13:29.054 --> 01:13:30.472
no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:31.974
Out of respect
for Fisher.

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.475
Out of respect
for you--

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:34.476
listen to me,
listen to me--

01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:36.478
respect for your wife

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:38.939
and your wedding,
ok? All right?

01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:39.940
Do you hear where
I am here?

01:13:40.274 --> 01:13:40.983
I appreciate it.

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.484
You're just being
too hard on yourself.

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:43.485
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:44.987
This is my doing, ok?

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:46.447
Just stop.

01:13:46.447 --> 01:13:47.448
I'm gonna have a spark
of my own, all right?

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:50.784
Ahh!

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.411
Jesus!

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:55.998
Aah!

01:13:58.083 --> 01:13:59.918
Get up!

01:14:02.921 --> 01:14:04.923
You're mine!

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:05.924
I'm gonna do this for Lois...

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.511
and for my brother...

01:14:10.929 --> 01:14:12.473
and for the kids...

01:14:13.932 --> 01:14:15.934
I'm gonna turn myself in,
'cause I'm all that.

01:14:15.934 --> 01:14:16.935
Shh!

01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:18.437
Aaaaahhhhhh!

01:14:20.856 --> 01:14:22.900
I've
thinked it over, fish.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:23.901
What is it?

01:14:23.901 --> 01:14:24.902
Listen...

01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:26.987
if you think
about names,

01:14:26.987 --> 01:14:28.947
you know,
babies...

01:14:28.947 --> 01:14:30.949
Michael's a pretty
good one,

01:14:30.949 --> 01:14:32.951
you know?

01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:34.995
This stuff will
be over, right?

01:14:35.496 --> 01:14:36.955
Fish? Fish?

01:14:38.957 --> 01:14:40.959
You know what
I'm saying?

01:14:40.959 --> 01:14:42.002
Hello?

01:14:42.336 --> 01:14:44.004
Ok, here's the deal.

01:14:44.004 --> 01:14:46.006
And it's a good one.
Lois is cool.

01:14:46.006 --> 01:14:48.509
It's a pacified
situation.

01:14:48.509 --> 01:14:50.969
Whoa, whoa.
What do you mean?

01:14:51.095 --> 01:14:53.514
She's resting,
she's comfortable.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.973
The only thing is,

01:14:54.973 --> 01:14:56.975
you still got Michael there,
right? Right?

01:14:56.975 --> 01:14:57.976
Yeah.

01:14:58.519 --> 01:14:59.520
Ok, great.

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.522
She wants to see him
in person.

01:15:01.814 --> 01:15:03.023
She, uh...

01:15:03.023 --> 01:15:05.025
she needs to grieve
with her family.

01:15:05.025 --> 01:15:06.985
Just a little
family time.

01:15:06.985 --> 01:15:08.487
Right now?
Yeah.

01:15:08.487 --> 01:15:10.030
Well, isn't it
a little late?

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:13.492
Get over here and don't be so
goddamn selfish!

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.543
Ok, you guys
wait in the car.

01:15:22.543 --> 01:15:24.545
I'm gonna
take him in.

01:15:24.545 --> 01:15:26.547
She just wants to
see him alone.

01:15:26.547 --> 01:15:28.549
Lois wants
to see me?

01:15:28.549 --> 01:15:30.551
Here we go,
big guy.

01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:32.010
Upsy-daisy!

01:15:33.554 --> 01:15:36.014
Yes. She wants a big hug,
big family hug.

01:15:36.515 --> 01:15:37.349
Come on.

01:15:37.516 --> 01:15:39.017
One foot in front
of the other...

01:15:39.518 --> 01:15:40.352
there you go.

01:15:40.519 --> 01:15:41.520
- Hey, Fisher?
- Yeah?

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:44.064
I'm gonna do this,
and then we're gonna go to fatburger.

01:15:44.064 --> 01:15:45.524
Ok, big guy.

01:15:47.526 --> 01:15:48.527
Lois is
in the house.

01:15:48.527 --> 01:15:51.029
Come on, Michael,
get in the house.

01:16:06.044 --> 01:16:07.546
You know...

01:16:09.047 --> 01:16:12.050
I'm thinking about
maybe making a move.

01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:13.051
A move?

01:16:13.051 --> 01:16:15.554
Yeah. Greenpeace.

01:16:15.554 --> 01:16:16.555
Greenpeace?

01:16:16.555 --> 01:16:17.556
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:17.556 --> 01:16:20.058
Maybe go up to the north pole,
the arctic.

01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:23.562
Tag polar bears
with dart guns.

01:16:23.562 --> 01:16:26.064
I've always had
pretty good aim.

01:16:54.092 --> 01:16:56.637
Michael was in love
with Lois.

01:16:56.637 --> 01:16:59.598
That's what Michael and Adam
were arguing about

01:16:59.598 --> 01:17:01.600
in the parking lot.

01:17:01.725 --> 01:17:04.061
Michael killed Adam
in a jealous rage,

01:17:04.061 --> 01:17:06.021
Lois rejected Michael,

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.982
he strangled her
to death...

01:17:08.982 --> 01:17:12.861
and he shot himself
in the head.

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:14.863
Happens all the time.

01:17:19.159 --> 01:17:23.163
That Lois, she fought
like a fucking comanche.

01:17:25.666 --> 01:17:28.168
Well, I don't see how this
could have been kept from you.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:30.671
Last month, Adam and Lois
changed their will.

01:17:30.671 --> 01:17:34.216
They requested that you two,
as a married couple,

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:36.218
be custodians of record
for their estate,

01:17:36.426 --> 01:17:40.931
including all properties, cash holdings,
security holdings,

01:17:42.474 --> 01:17:43.976
and...children.

01:17:44.309 --> 01:17:47.938
Adam had a $500,000 term
life insurance policy.

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.398
What does that mean?

01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:51.900
That means we have $500,000 to help
raise the kids.

01:17:51.984 --> 01:17:52.859
No!
Yes.

01:17:52.859 --> 01:17:53.652
No!
Yes.

01:17:53.986 --> 01:17:55.445
Actually, no.

01:17:55.612 --> 01:17:59.449
Adam failed to make his last payment,
so his term life lapsed.

01:17:59.866 --> 01:18:02.953
But he did have a pension account
worth $150,000

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.539
and the house,
valued at 350,000.

01:18:05.539 --> 01:18:07.082
Ok, so where does
that leave us?

01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:09.084
150 and 350,

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.086
that takes us back up
to 500,000.

01:18:11.086 --> 01:18:13.088
Not even close.
The property value's down.

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.590
The house is worth
100,000 less...

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:18.051
3 credit cards...

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.012
the minivan payments...

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:23.932
and the income and the state taxes
assessed on his I.R.A...

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:26.601
that leaves you
in the neighborhood of...

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:30.564
$14,223.

01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:32.107
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.528
The hell did
you do that for,
you little asshole?

01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.530
What are you gonna do about it,
you little fucker?

01:18:38.530 --> 01:18:39.948
Come on, hit me!

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:42.576
Hey, hey,
come on--enough, enough, enough.

01:18:44.077 --> 01:18:45.037
So...

01:18:45.037 --> 01:18:46.621
when's the wedding?

01:18:47.039 --> 01:18:48.040
Tomorrow.

01:18:49.041 --> 01:18:51.084
We're getting
married tomorrow.

01:18:51.543 --> 01:18:53.086
I've had enough of you two devils!

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:54.629
Enough! Enough!

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:57.591
Excuse me for a moment.

01:18:59.384 --> 01:19:00.093
Enough!

01:19:00.093 --> 01:19:01.136
What is going on?

01:19:01.595 --> 01:19:02.596
These are your clients' kids!
Look at these--

01:19:03.013 --> 01:19:04.139
it's gonna be ok.

01:19:04.598 --> 01:19:06.141
It's not ok.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.102
It's not ok.
It's not ok.

01:19:09.102 --> 01:19:10.604
We're gonna be fine.

01:19:10.604 --> 01:19:13.065
We have to cancel.

01:19:13.065 --> 01:19:15.108
No. No, we don't,
no, we don't.

01:19:15.108 --> 01:19:16.610
It's gonna be ok,
honey--

01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:18.111
it's gonna be ok.

01:19:18.236 --> 01:19:19.613
Do you love me?

01:19:19.988 --> 01:19:22.616
Kyle...
it's gonna be ok.

01:19:22.949 --> 01:19:25.118
W-w-we killed
a woman.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.121
What are you
talking about?

01:19:28.121 --> 01:19:29.623
In Vegas.

01:19:29.915 --> 01:19:32.125
Michael killed
a woman.

01:19:32.376 --> 01:19:35.128
Michael killed her--
he hit her head and she bled.

01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:38.632
And she...she died.

01:19:38.632 --> 01:19:42.636
But there was nothing we could do about it,
so we buried her.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:44.638
Who's dead?

01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:46.640
The prostitute's dead.

01:19:46.807 --> 01:19:48.141
You fucked
a prostitute?

01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:49.643
No. Michael did.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:51.603
It was an accident,
Michael did it.

01:19:52.145 --> 01:19:53.146
Where is she?

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.649
She's buried
in the desert.

01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:59.653
You left
a dead prostitute alone in the desert?

01:19:59.903 --> 01:20:02.197
She's not alone.

01:20:02.239 --> 01:20:04.157
Boyd went--

01:20:04.241 --> 01:20:06.159
Boyd went crazy.

01:20:06.159 --> 01:20:08.203
He went nuts,
and he started killing everybody.

01:20:08.745 --> 01:20:11.206
He killed a guard.
He killed Michael.

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.207
He killed Lois--

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.751
stop, ok?
Just stop right there.

01:20:14.751 --> 01:20:17.713
I don't want to hear
any more of this, ok?

01:20:17.921 --> 01:20:20.715
I told you not to do
that stupid fucking bachelor party thing.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.259
I know.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.052
You were warned!
I know.

01:20:24.177 --> 01:20:25.720
You were warned, Kyle!
You were warned!

01:20:26.179 --> 01:20:27.723
I told you your friends
were just jackasses!

01:20:28.181 --> 01:20:29.725
I know!
And I'm sorry.

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:33.728
I've waited
27 years, ok?

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:37.732
27 years I have
focused and prepared

01:20:37.732 --> 01:20:40.193
to walk down
that aisle,

01:20:40.277 --> 01:20:42.237
and I will not
be derailed.

01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:44.781
I will not be
embarrassed,

01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:46.241
and I will not
be denied!

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:48.243
So tomorrow,
I am walking down that aisle,

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:51.163
come hell or high
fucking water!

01:21:28.241 --> 01:21:29.784
Ok!

01:21:29.784 --> 01:21:30.785
Showtime.

01:21:31.244 --> 01:21:32.245
We're about
two minutes out.

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:33.789
Moore?

01:21:33.997 --> 01:21:35.790
Better take
your position.

01:21:36.124 --> 01:21:37.250
Chop-chop!

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:40.253
Let me see you.

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:44.758
There you are.

01:21:45.717 --> 01:21:47.761
You look great, man.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:50.764
Go get 'em.

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.475
Hoooo...

01:21:56.603 --> 01:21:59.773
this is a situation
that defies judgment.

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:02.275
We have acted
and shown courage

01:22:02.484 --> 01:22:06.655
of a nature
not known by most.

01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:10.242
You've got a warped
though process.

01:22:10.242 --> 01:22:12.327
Your brain doesn't
function properly.

01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:13.245
Whatever you say,
kojak.

01:22:13.245 --> 01:22:14.287
I'm serious.

01:22:14.287 --> 01:22:15.288
No, no, no--

01:22:15.747 --> 01:22:17.332
I'mthe serious one
here, ok?

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:18.250
I'm the serious one.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:19.751
I'm the guy making
the fucking plays.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.337
I'm the Indian runner,
for Chris sake,

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.506
and I want my money!

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.092
What money?

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.301
Blood money!

01:22:28.301 --> 01:22:31.346
Insurance dollars
which you have thus far

01:22:31.346 --> 01:22:34.516
somehow let
slip your mind to tell me about!

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:37.352
You're sick.

01:22:37.811 --> 01:22:39.813
If you think you can fuck me,
fish,

01:22:40.355 --> 01:22:41.356
you can't, ok?

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:43.858
I'm backed up.
I'm insulated, baby!

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.860
Backed up on floppy,
do you get me?

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.862
I want that
fucking money!

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.865
Oh, god,
I can taste it!

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:51.866
Not a prayer.

01:22:52.075 --> 01:22:52.867
Goddamn it!

01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:54.870
I'm a fucking
lighthouse, man!

01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.330
I stay lit for you!
I stay lit!

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:01.042
I never go dark!
Never go dark!

01:23:04.838 --> 01:23:06.840
You need help.

01:23:07.841 --> 01:23:08.758
I want that
fucking money!

01:23:09.759 --> 01:23:11.845
I told Boyd
two fucking minutes.

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:14.848
I want my money!

01:23:14.848 --> 01:23:16.850
Aaahhhh!

01:23:19.603 --> 01:23:22.898
Hope you have a nice wedding,
you stupid idiot!

01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:26.901
You trying to cheat me,
you goddamn bastard!

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.362
Boyd!

01:23:30.822 --> 01:23:33.533
This is my day!

01:23:38.288 --> 01:23:39.372
Baby, wait! Wait!

01:23:39.873 --> 01:23:41.374
Stop, baby.

01:23:47.881 --> 01:23:49.883
Ok.

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.887
Stick him in the crapper
and get your ass upstairs.

01:23:54.012 --> 01:23:55.889
Baby?

01:24:01.394 --> 01:24:03.396
The best man's not
gonna make it.

01:24:03.396 --> 01:24:05.398
We're gonna just start,
ok?

01:24:05.398 --> 01:24:06.399
Sure.

01:24:06.399 --> 01:24:07.901
Great.

01:24:10.403 --> 01:24:12.364
Where's Boyd?

01:24:12.364 --> 01:24:13.907
In the toilet.

01:24:16.368 --> 01:24:19.371
We're gonna
get started, ok?

01:25:22.976 --> 01:25:24.519
Dearly beloved,

01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:28.523
we are all here today
because two very special people,

01:25:28.648 --> 01:25:29.524
Laura and Kyle,

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.025
have found each other.

01:25:31.484 --> 01:25:35.029
You can't...spawn
the salmon man!

01:25:35.113 --> 01:25:38.032
When I see
two young people
in love as they are,

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:42.036
I find myself renewed and inspired
because the spirit--

01:25:42.412 --> 01:25:44.039
rise!

01:25:44.956 --> 01:25:47.542
With hope for
the future and joy.

01:25:47.917 --> 01:25:49.461
I'm coming!

01:25:49.586 --> 01:25:50.545
Let us begin.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.005
May we have
the rings, please?

01:25:52.297 --> 01:25:54.007
I'm on my way!

01:25:54.299 --> 01:25:56.009
The rings.
We need the rings.

01:25:56.301 --> 01:25:57.093
I don't have
the rings.

01:25:57.302 --> 01:25:58.970
I got the ring!

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.555
Boyd has the rings.

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:03.057
I'm there...

01:26:03.266 --> 01:26:04.058
excuse me.

01:26:16.029 --> 01:26:17.989
Oh, god.

01:26:21.534 --> 01:26:23.578
Oh, god...

01:26:23.787 --> 01:26:24.621
where's the rings?

01:26:25.038 --> 01:26:26.039
Shh!

01:26:41.054 --> 01:26:43.515
Aaaahhhhhh!
Jesus christ!

01:26:53.566 --> 01:26:54.567
Got 'em.

01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:00.657
Now we can begin.

01:27:02.075 --> 01:27:05.578
Do you, Kyle,
take this woman Laura

01:27:05.703 --> 01:27:07.080
to be your wife
and helpmate

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:08.581
in sickness and in health

01:27:08.581 --> 01:27:11.042
along life's highways,
wherever they may take you,

01:27:11.543 --> 01:27:13.545
until death do you part?

01:27:13.545 --> 01:27:14.546
I do.

01:27:14.546 --> 01:27:16.548
And do you, Laura,
take this man Kyle--

01:27:16.548 --> 01:27:18.007
I do.

01:27:18.216 --> 01:27:19.592
You may
kiss the bride.

01:27:26.975 --> 01:27:28.059
Hey, guys?

01:27:28.518 --> 01:27:29.519
Listen, I need two minutes
with him.

01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:31.062
I'll be right out.

01:27:31.437 --> 01:27:32.522
Baby, I just want you
to know that all this,

01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:34.524
Everything I did,
is 'cause I love you

01:27:34.524 --> 01:27:36.526
And I wanted you
to have that wedding

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.069
Like you always
wanted to have, ok?

01:27:38.403 --> 01:27:39.529
You and moore are gonna go move
those fucking bodies,

01:27:40.029 --> 01:27:41.030
Do you
understand me?

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.574
And you're gonna
bury Boyd with them.

01:27:43.032 --> 01:27:44.033
And in fact,
you know what?

01:27:44.576 --> 01:27:46.578
You're gonna fucking put moore
in the ground, too.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:48.580
You want me
to kill moore?

01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:50.582
I know he's
your only friend left, ok?

01:27:50.707 --> 01:27:52.041
But he is
a loose string,

01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:53.042
And you are gonna
have to start

01:27:53.042 --> 01:27:55.044
Fucking flushing
the toilet like a big boy,

01:27:55.044 --> 01:27:56.045
Do you
understand me?

01:27:56.045 --> 01:27:57.046
Laura?

01:27:57.046 --> 01:27:58.548
Fuck!

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.049
You know...

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.551
You guys, listen--

01:28:01.551 --> 01:28:04.512
Two minutes, please. Just make my apologies for me.
Do your job.

01:28:04.637 --> 01:28:06.139
And while you're at it,
you know,

01:28:06.139 --> 01:28:08.099
Just get rid of
that fucking dog.

01:28:08.099 --> 01:28:09.559
The dog?

01:28:09.559 --> 01:28:11.060
I don't care what you do,
get rid of him.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.562
Lose him
in the desert.

01:28:12.562 --> 01:28:14.564
You want me to kill
the dog?

01:28:14.564 --> 01:28:16.065
Do you love me?
Yes.

01:28:16.065 --> 01:28:17.108
Do you?
Mm-hmm.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.109
Do you love me?

01:28:18.109 --> 01:28:19.110
Mm-hmm.

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:21.112
Do you love me?
Mm-hmm.

01:28:25.116 --> 01:28:27.118
Do it?

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.622
Laura!

01:28:30.622 --> 01:28:31.623
Fuck!

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.084
I told you
two fucking minutes!

01:29:57.208 --> 01:29:59.252
I've been thinking.

01:29:59.252 --> 01:30:02.797
I've been thinking
about what you said that day--

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:04.799
The prayer.

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.300
About using
this whole mess

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.302
To bring out
the good in me.

01:30:10.763 --> 01:30:11.764
I think there's a lot
of truth in that.

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:14.308
I'm gonna pursue
some options.

01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:20.314
I want to join that
big brother thing.

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.316
Yeah.

01:30:21.733 --> 01:30:24.318
I want a black one.

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.821
I want a little
black brother.

01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:30.283
It's a big problem,
it seems to me,

01:30:30.283 --> 01:30:31.284
You know?

01:30:31.826 --> 01:30:34.829
Lack of racial integration,
that's a big one.

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.831
Don't you think?

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:39.292
Kyle?

01:30:54.307 --> 01:30:56.309
Do you love me?

01:31:12.325 --> 01:31:14.827
That ought to be
about the end of that.

01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:18.831
Yup.

01:31:31.344 --> 01:31:33.346
Because that is
the point here, ok?

01:31:33.763 --> 01:31:36.349
That is what
I'm driving for.

01:31:36.349 --> 01:31:38.351
When the big storm comes

01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:39.811
And it knocks down
all the forests

01:31:39.811 --> 01:31:41.813
And all the rocks
fall down

01:31:41.813 --> 01:31:44.357
And all the leaves are bare,
what is left?

01:31:44.857 --> 01:31:47.318
What is left?

01:31:47.318 --> 01:31:50.321
The little trees.

01:31:50.863 --> 01:31:53.866
The little fellas
that the storm didn't see.

01:31:53.866 --> 01:31:56.160
The tiny little trees.

01:32:39.704 --> 01:32:42.206
Ok, boys, let's hear
the badger oath.

01:32:42.707 --> 01:32:44.709
Come on, boys,
Let's hear it one more time.

01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:46.210
A badger is great.

01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:50.214
A badger faces
great adversity...

01:32:51.716 --> 01:32:53.217
a badger
is economical,

01:32:53.426 --> 01:32:55.720
Saves for
the unforeseen.

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.221
A badger is sanitary,

01:32:57.597 --> 01:32:59.724
Keeps his mind
and body pure.

01:32:59.724 --> 01:33:00.725
Yes.

01:33:01.225 --> 01:33:02.685
Come on, let's see
the badger salute.

01:33:02.685 --> 01:33:03.686
Aw, no!

01:33:03.686 --> 01:33:05.688
Come on, let's see
the badger salute.

01:33:07.648 --> 01:33:08.733
Yes.

01:33:08.733 --> 01:33:10.193
Shit!

01:33:11.235 --> 01:33:12.737
The hell with it.

01:33:12.737 --> 01:33:14.238
Come on, give me
your hand.

01:33:14.238 --> 01:33:15.740
I don't need
any help!

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:19.202
If you don't reach out to me,
I can't help.

01:33:19.202 --> 01:33:20.745
Leave me alone!

01:33:20.745 --> 01:33:23.206
Your new mommy's
coming.

01:33:23.706 --> 01:33:25.208
Your new mommy's--

01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:28.252
Come on. Come on, now.
We're gonna make it.

01:33:28.753 --> 01:33:30.254
Let's talk about
our feelings.

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:31.714
I hate you
and your bitch wife!

01:33:31.839 --> 01:33:33.257
Get your own crutch,
stump boy!

01:33:33.549 --> 01:33:35.259
Please clean
the bathroom.

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:38.179
Let's talk about our feelings.
How do we feel?

01:33:38.304 --> 01:33:39.722
A little help?

01:33:39.805 --> 01:33:41.724
I can't breathe,
asshole!

01:33:42.725 --> 01:33:43.726
A little help,
please?

01:33:43.726 --> 01:33:45.228
Let go of me,
you gimp!

01:33:45.311 --> 01:33:46.229
A little help?

01:33:48.231 --> 01:33:50.233
Honey, could you help me
with the wheelchair?

01:33:50.775 --> 01:33:52.777
Honey? I need some help.

01:33:53.236 --> 01:33:55.780
That's ok, she's not
running from you.

01:33:56.239 --> 01:33:58.658
Help me, honey. You want to talk
about us?
