00:00.368 --> 00:04.538
**

00:04.572 --> 00:06.374
So do you guys
have a safe word?
Lucy No.

00:06.407 --> 00:09.643
He's consented
to pretty much

00:09.677 --> 00:12.413
whatever I want to do,

00:12.446 --> 00:14.115
of course, beyond, like,
killing him,

00:14.148 --> 00:15.516
which I would never do.

00:20.088 --> 00:24.758
**

00:24.792 --> 00:27.195
Karley:
Ugh. Life is so hard.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.762
Between meeting
my blog deadlines

00:28.796 --> 00:30.498
and performing my gender,

00:30.531 --> 00:32.800
I barely have time
to get anything done.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.337
Sometimes I wish I had someone
who would clean my apartment,

00:36.370 --> 00:38.072
change my tampons

00:38.106 --> 00:40.141
and, like, drop to their knees
and be my human bench

00:40.174 --> 00:42.476
whenever I got tired,
you know?

00:42.510 --> 00:45.379
God,
I need a lifestyle slave.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.681
I've heard that
it's actually a thing,

00:47.715 --> 00:50.551
but who on this flat Earth
would want that job,

00:50.584 --> 00:53.254
and am I bitch
for wanting one?

00:53.287 --> 00:56.490
And, more importantly,
is there an app for that?

00:56.524 --> 01:00.494
**

01:05.299 --> 01:07.168
Back in my mid-20s,

01:07.201 --> 01:09.737
I moonlit as a dominatrix
for a couple of years.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.172
For me, this basically meant

01:11.205 --> 01:12.640
that Wall Street bros
would pay me

01:12.673 --> 01:14.575
to pee on them in a dungeon
for, like, an hour,

01:14.608 --> 01:17.745
but it never extended
beyond that into my actual life.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.280
But I have a friend.

01:19.313 --> 01:20.881
She goes by the name
Mistress Lucy Sweetkill,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.584
and she's a full-time
professional dominatrix,

01:23.617 --> 01:25.586
but her relationships
with her submissives

01:25.619 --> 01:27.188
get very personal,

01:27.221 --> 01:29.523
far more than anything
I've ever experienced.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.793
Some of them even serve her
on a 24/7 basis.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.562
In the BDSM community,

01:34.595 --> 01:36.664
this is what's known
as a lifestyle slave,

01:36.697 --> 01:38.632
and I want
to find out more about

01:38.666 --> 01:40.468
what this dynamic
has to offer

01:40.501 --> 01:42.436
for both parties involved.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.871
Karley:
So you have clients

01:43.904 --> 01:46.207
who pay you to session with
in a dungeon,

01:46.240 --> 01:47.908
and then you also have
lifestyle slaves

01:47.941 --> 01:50.178
who are people who, like,
follow you around,

01:50.211 --> 01:53.447
carry your handbag,
and, like, TBD.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.450
My business is filled with
a lot of clients

01:56.484 --> 01:59.353
who just
want to be submissive

01:59.387 --> 02:03.391
in a specific session
in a paid time,

02:03.424 --> 02:04.592
and then that's all.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.694
And then a lifestyle

02:06.727 --> 02:09.562
wants to actually do it
more 24/7.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.799
They serve me
on a day-to-day.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.834
Some are great
at cooking.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.737
Some are great
at technology.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.839
So they're, like,
unpaid, sex-slave interns.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.809
Um...yeah.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.277
They're definitely unpaid.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.913
But the exchange
is different.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.582
They provide support
in my life,

02:28.616 --> 02:32.320
and I support them
through this journey

02:32.353 --> 02:34.922
of connecting
to their submission

02:34.955 --> 02:36.924
and connecting
to their sexuality

02:36.957 --> 02:38.959
that only a dominant
in their life

02:38.992 --> 02:40.261
can help them do.

02:40.294 --> 02:47.535
**

02:47.568 --> 02:48.602
Hello.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.438
Hi, Pups.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.873
Leave your bag over there.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.542
Shoes off.

02:54.575 --> 02:59.447
**

02:59.480 --> 03:01.615
Let's put your collar on.

03:01.649 --> 03:02.983
**

03:03.016 --> 03:06.320
Karley: So how did
you meet Pain Puppy?

03:06.354 --> 03:08.222
Lucy: Pain Puppy was a client
in the dungeon.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.824
I kind of saw something
in him

03:10.858 --> 03:12.626
that you know, was like,

03:12.660 --> 03:15.629
"This person is much more
submissive than he realizes."

03:15.663 --> 03:17.831
And then, from there,

03:17.865 --> 03:20.834
we organically had
the conversation of, like,

03:20.868 --> 03:25.005
"Do you want to try something
a little more 24/7?"

03:25.038 --> 03:29.543
Lucy: Why don't you make me
some tea, actually, too?

03:29.577 --> 03:31.779
Fill it halfway only,
though.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.980
Which flavor
would you like?

03:33.013 --> 03:34.448
Your not
watching the water.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.649
That's not halfway.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.618
Do you know
what halfway means?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.487
I watched.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.888
If I looked at it,
would it be halfway?
Yes.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.323
Would you like to look?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.358
This is the line
it can only go to.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.459
Go pour some of it out.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.261
**

03:47.295 --> 03:48.762
So do you have sex
with Puppy?

03:48.796 --> 03:50.364
No.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.300
It's sexual in nature,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.802
but it's not
penetrative sex.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.472
There is no, you know,
oral, vaginal penetration --

03:58.506 --> 03:59.707
none of that.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.375
So what do you get
out of this dynamic?

04:01.409 --> 04:03.611
Well, the obvious thing is
I get support.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.581
But, for me, it's a very deep
personal enjoyment.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.049
There are people out there

04:09.082 --> 04:11.785
who feel like
they're outside of their skin,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.421
but when they're with me,

04:13.454 --> 04:15.356
they feel
they're most whole.

04:15.389 --> 04:19.593
Make sure, like, Mrs. Hazel
is put in his cage.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.060
I want it all clean.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.996
Karley: So, basically,
she gets all the perks

04:23.030 --> 04:24.632
of having a manservant.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.799
Jealous.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.635
But what about
the other side.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.370
I need to know.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.472
What can you get out of
doing someone's bitch work?

04:31.505 --> 04:32.806
**

04:32.840 --> 04:35.042
All right, I need you
to do a few things for me.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.345
I put them
in your slave tasks,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.713
but I need you
to go grab the laundry.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.750
**

04:42.783 --> 04:44.752
* Dun, dun, da-da

04:44.785 --> 04:46.620
So this is Lucy's laundry,
yeah?

04:46.654 --> 04:49.056
I'm doing the laundry
for her job,

04:49.089 --> 04:50.558
which is, like,
from her dungeon.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.526
Oh, you're literally
cleaning the robes.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.628
Yes.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.364
Is there anything gross
in there?

04:56.397 --> 04:57.865
I don't know
where they've been.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.401
Do you enjoy
doing chores for her?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.636
Maybe not in the idea
that most people have.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.104
Like, most people
probably think

05:04.137 --> 05:05.973
that I enjoy,
like, cleaning and stuff.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.642
It's more of, like,
supporting her and her business.

05:08.676 --> 05:09.977
I'm part of Team Lucy.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.879
So you don't get a boner
from doing laundry?

05:11.912 --> 05:13.013
I wish.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.349
I wish it was that easy.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.351
Do you have
sexual interactions

05:17.385 --> 05:20.354
with people outside of
your relationship with Lucy?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.989
Not very often anymore

05:22.022 --> 05:24.091
just because of
my whole chastity device.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.995
Can you explain what it means
to be in chastity

05:28.028 --> 05:29.997
because I think
some people/partially me

05:30.030 --> 05:31.665
have no idea
what that means.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.001
It's...hmm.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.470
It's a tube
you put your penis in,

05:36.504 --> 05:37.805
and then it locks on,

05:37.838 --> 05:41.575
and then it prevents you
from getting erect,

05:41.609 --> 05:45.045
and, also, you can't really
touch yourself or have sex.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.880
My vagina, like, hurts
thinking about that.

05:46.914 --> 05:47.881
So does mine.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.019
So what makes
a good lifestyle slave?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.788
Depends on the person,
I guess.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.457
So, for me,
I'm, like, handyman.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.691
I'm good at cleaning now,

05:57.725 --> 05:58.926
because I've been
cleaning her dungeon

05:58.959 --> 06:00.428
for, like,
a year and a half.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.630
So this is like a job for you,
essentially.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.698
You look at it as,
she's your employer.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.901
It's part employment,
part life coach-y,

06:07.935 --> 06:09.903
and, in return,
I get a mistress.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.906
Karley:
What was Pain Puppy like
when you first met him?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.475
He was very shy.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.144
So is slave training
sort of like a makeover?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.979
Yeah, I would say,
in certain ways.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.781
And with Pups,
we talked about

06:20.814 --> 06:22.716
how he didn't really
have friends,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.618
so we worked on
all of that.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.587
I set up a schedule.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.922
I controlled his calendar.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.058
We worked on him
working out.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.827
You know, he took a wine course
for eight weeks.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.963
He took
some Japanese classes.

06:35.996 --> 06:40.033
And through all those things,
he gained friends.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.102
He's kind of
changed his outlook.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.637
Wow.

06:43.671 --> 06:46.540
I met Lucy, maybe, at
a bottom point in my life.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.642
I was really depressed,
you know.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.944
I didn't like my body image
back then.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.180
When I met her,
I was 200,

06:53.213 --> 06:57.818
and then, now, I fluctuate
between 160 and 170,

06:57.851 --> 07:00.854
but it's muscle now
and not flubber.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.756
That's a huge change.
Mm-hmm.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.958
Wow.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.528
It's definitely been,
you know,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.029
a struggle to get here,

07:09.062 --> 07:12.466
but she's taught me
a lot about myself.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.102
Karley: So Puppy gets,
kind of, a life makeover.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.670
That's cool.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.071
But isn't he exhausted

07:18.105 --> 07:19.773
from slaving around the Earth
all day?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.709
It seems like
a big price to pay

07:21.742 --> 07:23.844
for a workout regimen
and a spanking.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.847
You're a weirdo.
I'm a weirdo.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.215
You're a pervert.
I'm a pervert.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.217
-This will cut skin.
-Nice.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.086
**

07:35.022 --> 07:37.224
**

07:37.257 --> 07:39.660
Karley: These days, thanks
to "Fifty Shades of Grey,"

07:39.693 --> 07:41.662
everyone knows
about the pleasures

07:41.695 --> 07:44.765
of tying someone to your bed
and torturing them, obviously.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.266
But who wants
that kind of abuse

07:46.299 --> 07:48.035
to extend into
their everyday life?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.803
Huh.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.939
I wonder what the average
enlightened New Yorker

07:51.972 --> 07:53.741
has to say
about the prospect of being

07:53.774 --> 07:56.544
in a full-time
master-slave relationship?

07:56.577 --> 07:57.978
Are you guys
all familiar with

07:58.011 --> 07:59.680
the BDSM term
"lifestyle slave?"

07:59.713 --> 08:00.814
Yes.
I'm not, but okay.

08:00.848 --> 08:01.815
Actually -- yes.
Yeah.

08:01.849 --> 08:02.883
Vaguely, yeah.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.718
Uh, kind of,
yeah, generally.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.153
Like, I have the Internet
at home, so...

08:06.186 --> 08:07.120
A lifestyle what?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.589
Like,
what is that to you?

08:08.622 --> 08:10.958
You being with another
individual partner

08:10.991 --> 08:13.961
and doing whatever that
they want to do to you.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.529
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.597
You didn't know that?

08:16.630 --> 08:17.865
Now that I know,

08:17.898 --> 08:19.266
that's gonna be
a hard "no" from me.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.268
There ain't
nobody locking me up.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.537
Would you be interested
in having

08:23.571 --> 08:24.838
sort of, like,
a full-time sex intern?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.707
Yeah.
That'd be sick.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.175
Would you want to have
a lifestyle slave?

08:28.208 --> 08:29.577
No,
I don't think I would.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.311
Does that appeal to you?
Hell, no.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.913
I think I could do it
to someone else.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.648
And what about you?

08:34.682 --> 08:36.183
Would you rather be
the submissive or the dominant?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.051
The dominant.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.186
I'm not about to get hit.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.253
Yeah.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.324
Karley:
While many people seem open
to bossing someone around,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.193
most seem vaguely traumatized

08:46.226 --> 08:49.062
by the idea
of being enslaved 24/7.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.931
Is there something
inherently tragic

08:50.964 --> 08:53.300
about a person
wanting to be abused?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.935
Deep thoughts.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.204
I need to consult
with an actual smart person

08:57.237 --> 08:58.906
to get a better understanding

08:58.939 --> 09:01.174
of why someone would sign up
to be a literal slave.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.145
The term slave is such
an intense word to use

09:05.178 --> 09:07.748
in association with your
sexuality or lifestyle.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.049
Absolutely.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.852
Slave is a very loaded,
very intense word.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.755
In some ways, though,
I think it is appropriate

09:14.788 --> 09:16.824
for the level of intensity

09:16.857 --> 09:19.893
that this kind of lifestyle
involves.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.262
And I'm sure,
for a lot of people,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.998
that loadedness
is part of the appeal.

09:25.032 --> 09:28.201
Why would someone want to do
someone else's chores, though?

09:28.235 --> 09:31.204
Like, what is the impetus
of being a lifestyle slave?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.906
It comes down to

09:32.940 --> 09:35.743
our human need
to be taken care of

09:35.776 --> 09:37.811
and to take care
of other people.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.814
And, so, for some,
that kind of gets taken

09:40.848 --> 09:42.716
to one extreme or the other,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.885
having a lot more of
one of those needs

09:44.918 --> 09:46.820
and a lot less of
the other need.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.122
So, are these relationships
exploitative?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.959
People do have this notion
that it's exploitative,

09:51.992 --> 09:54.394
that the dominant
gets everything they want,

09:54.427 --> 09:55.929
and then the submissive,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.665
all they do is just
give, give, give, right?

09:57.698 --> 09:58.966
But at the same time,

09:58.999 --> 10:00.267
there's
a lot of responsibility

10:00.300 --> 10:02.335
in a dominant taking over

10:02.369 --> 10:04.838
the reins
of somebody else's life.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.274
They are responsible
for what this person eats.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.342
Do they smoke?
Do they drink?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.011
Do they have
other partners or not?

10:11.044 --> 10:14.414
And for the submissive,
there is something appealing

10:14.447 --> 10:17.985
about wanting to kind of
not have control,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.853
not be responsible.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.255
There is a certain level
of freedom in that.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.092
**

10:25.125 --> 10:26.894
So I'm outside
to the grocery store.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.328
I'm about to meet Pups

10:28.361 --> 10:31.865
and Shine, who's Lucy's
other lifestyle slave.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.667
Lucy says
she often send her subs

10:33.701 --> 10:35.302
out on sort of lifestyle slave
team-building exercises...

10:35.335 --> 10:37.137
Man: You're welcome.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.006
Pain Puppy: Let's shop.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.274
...like, shop for groceries,
for example.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.443
So now that I understand
that each person

10:43.476 --> 10:45.946
gets something unique
from this relationship,

10:45.979 --> 10:48.248
it will be interesting to see
how everyone gets along.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.984
Are they, like, one happy
little perverted family?

10:51.018 --> 10:52.820
What's on the list
that Lucy gave you?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.021
Okay.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.924
So last night,
she requested, uh,

10:56.957 --> 10:59.159
chips, salsa, guacamole,

10:59.192 --> 11:00.861
strawberries,
blueberries, pineapple.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.030
Okay, so you guys, like,
know her eating habits

11:03.063 --> 11:04.197
and what she doesn't like?

11:04.231 --> 11:06.133
I have a total list
going on.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.868
**

11:07.901 --> 11:09.236
May I do something?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.740
Do you guys fight over
who gets to carry her stuff?

11:12.773 --> 11:15.175
I do like carrying her stuff,
anyone's stuff.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.343
I love it.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.245
**

11:18.278 --> 11:19.913
So do you guys

11:19.947 --> 11:22.883
ever get competitive
with each other?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.451
Yeah.
No.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.019
Yeah, Pups.
Not with Shine.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.254
Some of my favorite times

11:27.287 --> 11:28.722
have been
with Puppy and her --

11:28.756 --> 11:30.858
together,
all three of us playing.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.260
It's just like,
oh, my god, so powerful.
Why do you like that?

11:33.293 --> 11:35.262
Because of the connection,
you know,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.898
of taking her pain
together.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.066
Oh. That's nice.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.734
And speaking of pain...

11:40.768 --> 11:42.002
Pain Puppy:

11:42.035 --> 11:43.737
...whoa,
this is solid pain.

11:43.771 --> 11:44.738
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.006
Lucy: Nice stuff.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.274
They're talking about you,
obviously.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.442
Lucy: Yeah.
Let's see if this --

11:49.476 --> 11:50.978
This doesn't look good.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.913
Put your jacket down.
All right.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.247
Thank you.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.384
Karley:
Do you feel like there is

11:57.417 --> 11:59.452
still a lingering stigma?

11:59.486 --> 12:02.055
I definitely think
there's still a stigma,

12:02.089 --> 12:06.493
but I've hid parts of myself
long enough,

12:06.526 --> 12:09.930
and all I feel
is upset at myself.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.833
BDSM is not for everyone,

12:12.866 --> 12:17.304
but I find the most caring,
compassionate,

12:17.337 --> 12:18.939
and open-minded people

12:18.972 --> 12:21.074
come from the BDSM community

12:21.108 --> 12:24.044
because everybody's
weirdness

12:24.077 --> 12:25.412
is positive, you know?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.080
You're a weirdo.
I'm a weirdo.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.049
You're a pervert.
I'm a pervert, you know.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.517
Let's do this.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.252
Karley: Wow.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.987
Sharing pork rinds
and strawberries

12:34.021 --> 12:36.523
with these leather-clad perverts
got me thinking.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.493
Maybe lifestyle slaves
are just like us...

12:40.527 --> 12:43.263
Pain Puppy:

12:43.296 --> 12:45.799
Karley: ...except for, maybe,
a few minor differences.

12:50.337 --> 12:55.876
**

12:55.909 --> 12:57.577
Karley: I'm here
at a dungeon in Chelsea

12:57.610 --> 12:59.246
about to go meet
Lucy and Puppy

12:59.279 --> 13:01.314
to watch one of
their BDSM play sessions.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.550
**

13:03.583 --> 13:05.919
And I think
what's gonna happen is that,

13:05.953 --> 13:07.454
essentially,
she's just going to whip him

13:07.487 --> 13:09.556
into a state
of transcendence,

13:09.589 --> 13:12.292
but I guess
I'm gonna find out.

13:12.325 --> 13:17.130
**

13:17.164 --> 13:20.834
Lucy: So I have, you know,
some hoods and gags.

13:20.868 --> 13:22.302
I love latex,

13:22.335 --> 13:24.571
so I'm wearing
one of my catsuits.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.473
It looks good.
Thank you.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.342
My two favorite whips
with me,

13:29.376 --> 13:32.512
and this one is what
we call a single-tail whip,

13:32.545 --> 13:35.315
and this is a mini bullwhip.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.350
So this is
really painful?
Yes.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.486
It's one of the most painful.
This will cut the skin.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.488
Nice.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.623
Okay, so,
where is Puppy, anyway?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.026
He's in the bathroom
getting ready.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.194
Pups, come out.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.097
Karley: Hey.
Hello.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.598
Nice undies.
Thank you.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.333
It's my favorite color --
pink.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.435
Lucy: You want to show her
what they say?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.338
Karley: Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.040
They have matching tops,
too.

14:00.073 --> 14:04.011
**

14:04.044 --> 14:06.013
So do you guys
have a safe word?
No.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.882
That's part of our consensual
non-consent.

14:08.916 --> 14:12.152
He's consented
to pretty much

14:12.185 --> 14:14.922
whatever I want to do,

14:14.955 --> 14:16.924
of course,
beyond, like, killing him.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.325
Which I would never do.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.293
Would you ever consent to that,
like, ahead of time?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.896
Would that be something
that, like, would happen?
That's my limit.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.299
So he's shining
your latex now.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.968
Yeah. Spray more.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.937
Don't rub it in too hard,
though.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.972
Latex takes
a lot of maintenance.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.306
As a rubber fetishist,

14:33.340 --> 14:35.442
this is definitely his treat
right now,

14:35.475 --> 14:39.046
before it gets painful.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.148
Karley: Having been
a dominatrix myself,

14:41.181 --> 14:43.316
seeing someone be bullwhipped
is old news,

14:43.350 --> 14:44.617
but it's harder to imagine

14:44.651 --> 14:46.553
torturing someone
you see everyday

14:46.586 --> 14:48.388
as opposed to
beating up a random.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.625
It'll be interesting to see
how this feels different.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.427
All right,
I'm going to go soft first.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.530
And then maybe
every third or fourth one

14:57.564 --> 14:59.066
is gonna be
a little bit harder.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.334
Mm-hmm?

15:01.368 --> 15:02.936
One.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.471
**

15:04.504 --> 15:05.939
Two.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.577
Three.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.379
I like to aim
for the nipple

15:12.412 --> 15:15.415
because I am nasty
like that.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.087
-Ooh.
-Good job, Pups.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.454
Look at that.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.423
Is your spit
getting everywhere?

15:23.456 --> 15:24.691
Swallow.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.061
We're gonna hear
what noises come out of you

15:28.095 --> 15:29.362
without a gag.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.637
**

15:37.670 --> 15:40.340
Mm. Good boy.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.342
I just think
they're so beautiful,

15:42.375 --> 15:45.345
these, you know,
signs of devotion.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.014
Pups, turn to the side
and show Karley.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.249
Yeah. Yeah.
That's all from today?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.484
That thing is not joking.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.486
And I like to work
on my backhand.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.493
Good boy.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.661
What was that like?

16:01.694 --> 16:03.663
It hits that spot,

16:03.696 --> 16:07.334
and I will get to what I'm
looking for eventually.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.469
You seem really calm,
actually.
Yeah.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.304
I'm fine right now.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.040
I can't really
say things right now.
Yeah.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.677
Your mind goes somewhere else
in a subspace,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.479
and you're just feeling.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.648
Is there a sexual component
to this for you?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.583
Like, are you --
This is not sexual?

16:23.616 --> 16:26.053
In the same way
it's mental for her,
it's mental for me.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.554
This isn't my sex.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.322
This is my endorphin rush.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.392
We've done
a powerful session before,

16:32.425 --> 16:34.427
where I was whipping him,

16:34.461 --> 16:36.596
and I was going
through some --

16:36.629 --> 16:41.034
so really emotional things
myself, personally,

16:41.068 --> 16:45.272
and while he was,
you know, definitely
crying and releasing

16:45.305 --> 16:48.408
from the things
he needed to get out of him,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.310
I was as well, you know.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.046
And there was
that back-and-forth of, like,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.715
that I needed
that release, too.

16:55.748 --> 17:00.487
**

17:00.520 --> 17:02.789
You know, I'm gonna
put him in a body bag,

17:02.822 --> 17:05.192
and it's almost like
a place for him

17:05.224 --> 17:06.459
to sort of decompress,

17:06.492 --> 17:08.194
like a sensory
deprivation tank,

17:08.228 --> 17:12.132
and just let it mentally,
like, let him float.

17:12.165 --> 17:16.336
**

17:16.368 --> 17:17.737
Karley: Watching them,

17:17.770 --> 17:19.406
it was very clear
that they both really enjoyed

17:19.439 --> 17:20.839
the roles
that they were playing

17:20.873 --> 17:22.675
and that they have
a genuine chemistry.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.578
A more traditional couple
would use sex

17:25.612 --> 17:29.582
as a way to achieve a state
of intimacy and vulnerability,

17:29.616 --> 17:31.218
and it just felt like

17:31.251 --> 17:34.154
they were using pain
to achieve the same thing.

17:34.187 --> 17:35.788
I realize that
it's counterintuitive

17:35.822 --> 17:38.358
to leave a scene where someone
is being beaten until they bleed

17:38.391 --> 17:39.826
and say
that it was a sweet moment,

17:39.859 --> 17:42.562
but it did genuinely
feel that way.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.099
And ultimately,
she looked really hot,

17:46.133 --> 17:48.101
which is probably
the most important thing.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.802
And I should probably
get myself some latex.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.304
Karley: Would you be okay
with sort of, like,

17:51.338 --> 17:52.739
cleaning my vibrators?

17:53.806 --> 17:56.709
**

17:58.645 --> 18:01.281
**

18:01.314 --> 18:03.383
Karley: After spending time
with Lucy and Puppy,

18:03.416 --> 18:04.717
I've realized that each side

18:04.751 --> 18:06.619
gets something special
from this dynamic.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.489
They perfectly cater
to each other's kinks and needs.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.191
So, it turns out,

18:11.224 --> 18:13.360
there's nothing bitchy
about wanting a lifestyle slave,

18:13.393 --> 18:14.694
because let's be honest --

18:14.727 --> 18:16.596
Being a mistress
sounds like a full-time job.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.598
Clearly,
I need to find a submissive

18:18.631 --> 18:20.333
who I truly connect to.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.170
And so I've put out
a casting call

18:23.203 --> 18:25.472
for my own lifestyle slave.

18:25.505 --> 18:28.175
**

18:28.208 --> 18:29.242
Hi.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.477
Hello.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.644
Why are you interested

18:31.678 --> 18:33.313
in being
my lifestyle slave?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.582
When I first
started having sex,

18:35.615 --> 18:38.218
I realized, like,
very, very quickly

18:38.251 --> 18:42.355
that vanilla sex
was just not my cup of tea.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.592
**

18:45.625 --> 18:47.160
Hi.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.661
Do you think
that you're qualified

18:48.695 --> 18:49.762
to be my lifestyle slave?

18:49.796 --> 18:50.863
**

18:50.897 --> 18:52.599
Do you find me attractive?

18:52.632 --> 18:56.603
**

18:56.636 --> 18:58.305
Hey.
-Hi.

18:58.338 --> 18:59.939
Sadley -- where'd you get
that name?

18:59.972 --> 19:02.342
It was given to me
by my mistress.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.544
So you have
another mistress?
Yes.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.579
Are you slutty?
Yes.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.515
Same.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.882
I'm looking for someone

19:09.916 --> 19:12.319
who is really great
at being a human bench

19:12.352 --> 19:13.853
because I like
to wear high heels,

19:13.886 --> 19:15.755
so, when I'm walking
around the city,

19:15.788 --> 19:17.357
sometimes I get really tired,
My feet hurt.
Me too, yeah.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.825
I need someone
who's just gonna be like,

19:18.858 --> 19:21.228
"Get down on all fours,"
and I can sit on your back.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.896
You can certainly sit
and rest yourself on my body.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.866
If it helps you,
it makes me feel good.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.401
How squeamish are you?

19:28.435 --> 19:29.736
Like, would you be okay
with, sort of, like,

19:29.769 --> 19:31.238
cleaning my vibrators

19:31.271 --> 19:32.939
or, like, picking up
sort of used condoms,

19:32.972 --> 19:34.474
like, next to my bed?

19:34.507 --> 19:37.544
Are you good at shaving
my bikini line?

19:38.878 --> 19:40.413
I'm not even good
at that.

19:40.447 --> 19:43.616
I enjoy
going down on women.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.352
Have you ever gone down
on a girl

19:45.385 --> 19:46.486
when she had her period?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.920
No.
Okay.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.522
That was unrelated,
but I was just wondering.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.557
No. It's fine.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.259
What turns you on sexually?

19:52.292 --> 19:54.694
Being slapped and spanked,

19:54.727 --> 19:55.862
spit on.
Oh, really?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.397
I love to be spanked.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.967
**

20:02.502 --> 20:04.704
Karley: They were all
promising candidates,

20:04.737 --> 20:07.774
but there was just something
about this one guy.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.842
Did you have
some kind of "aha" moment

20:09.876 --> 20:10.910
where you were like,

20:10.943 --> 20:12.445
"Oh, this is exactly
the role

20:12.479 --> 20:13.880
that I've always
wanted to play"?

20:13.913 --> 20:17.350
There was a moment
that I was instructed

20:17.384 --> 20:19.519
to untie a knot
for my mistress.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.621
The urgency
to untie this knot

20:21.654 --> 20:24.324
became more and more intense,

20:24.357 --> 20:25.725
and it was really
at that moment

20:25.758 --> 20:27.294
that it really clicked on me

20:27.327 --> 20:29.562
that there was more than
just -- just fun to this.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.931
I have a need to please,

20:31.964 --> 20:34.667
to give of myself
to someone,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.736
and that makes me
feel needed,

20:36.769 --> 20:38.371
and it gives me purpose.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.672
So being a submissive
seems like

20:39.706 --> 20:41.040
it's been
very therapeutic for you?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.442
Absolutely.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.543
That's cool.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.546
Yeah.
I kind of like it, myself.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.748
Can you tell me
what your kinks are?

20:48.781 --> 20:51.984
I enjoy being whipped
intensely and hard.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.287
So you want me to whip you
intensely and hard?

20:54.321 --> 20:55.688
Yes, please, mistress.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.290
I feel like we're really
gonna get along.

20:57.324 --> 20:58.057
I'd love that.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.559
This is great.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.863
What position do you like
to be spanked in?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.498
Uh, for ease, I suppose,

21:05.532 --> 21:07.600
if I put my hands
on the chairs

21:07.634 --> 21:10.803
and place my buttocks
in your general direction.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.004
Okay. Let's try.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.408
**

21:17.043 --> 21:19.412
You like that?
I did like that.
Thank you, mistress.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.682
On a pain scale
from 1 to 10,

21:22.715 --> 21:23.816
how bad was that?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.552
About a 6.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.953
You can go way more hard,
yes, mistress.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.393
How was that?

21:33.426 --> 21:34.627
Thank you, mistress.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.728
**

21:35.762 --> 21:37.330
Thank you.
Thank you, mistress.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.731
I really enjoyed that.
Did you?

21:38.765 --> 21:40.367
Yeah, you made me
feel really good.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.769
I'm glad because
it made me feel good, too.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.871
Karley: After hanging out
with a dominatrix

21:44.904 --> 21:46.906
and her devoted
lifestyle slaves,

21:46.939 --> 21:50.009
I've realized that all day,
every day, dom-sub partnerships

21:50.042 --> 21:52.345
can be just as versatile
and transformative

21:52.379 --> 21:54.046
as vanilla relationships.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.848
Sure, the
dom gets her chores done,

21:55.882 --> 21:57.417
but the slaves get

21:57.450 --> 21:58.818
the acceptance and discipline
they crave,

21:58.851 --> 22:00.953
because, really,
we all just want to be loved

22:00.987 --> 22:03.122
for the freaks
that we are, right?

22:03.155 --> 22:05.525
Relationships come
in all different shapes,

22:05.558 --> 22:07.126
sizes, and perversions,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.429
whether you only sleep
with one person for life

22:09.462 --> 22:10.797
or you sleep in a cage.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.399
The moral of the story is,

22:12.432 --> 22:14.701
there's someone out there
for everyone.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.769
And, as for me,
well, it turns out

22:16.803 --> 22:19.672
my submissive Prince Charming
actually does exist,

22:19.706 --> 22:21.107
and I don't even have to feel
like a...about it.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.443
Whip you later, sluts.
