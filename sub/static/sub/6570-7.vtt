Please don't make me go to work today.
I'll fake my own death.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.206
You don't have the cheekbones
for depression. What's the matter?

00:24.280 --> 00:26.760
- The workload, the spotlight.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.723
Getting hammered on the Families First bill.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.205
People hate that thing.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.442
Yeah, it's falling apart
like a punched wedding cake.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.725
And the President wants me to start getting
the media calling it the "Meyer bill,"

00:36.800 --> 00:38.962
but they've decided to call it
the "Mommy Meyer bill."

00:40.200 --> 00:42.043
- My job is impossible.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.805
Take this fork,
stab me right here in the carotid.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.451
You are the most influential Mike person

00:47.520 --> 00:48.885
-in the world.
-(SNICKERS)

00:48.960 --> 00:50.883
The President won her first debate
thanks to you.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.043
Guess what? There's two more.
And the next one's foreign policy.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.044
That's basically a quiz on the entire world.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.049
- How do I prep for that?
- Listen to me.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.640
You're gonna shake it off, all right?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.722
Stiff upper lip. Put on a happy face.

01:03.800 --> 01:04.881
And have the best day of your life.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.525
Thank you for the pep talk.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.690
I'll see you... Oh, shit. Happy birthday.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.245
I'm sorry
I didn't have time to get you anything.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.527
I'm gonna try after work.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.125
Love you.

01:18.720 --> 01:23.123
<i>I live on a regular street in real America</i>

01:23.200 --> 01:25.407
<i>with real trees and real cars.</i>

01:25.520 --> 01:29.445
- SELINA: <i>We do have real cars on my street.
- Ah... Wait for it.</i>

01:29.560 --> 01:33.326
<i>I'm not sure what a fake car would be exactly.</i>

01:33.400 --> 01:34.606
Barn!

01:34.680 --> 01:36.011
I should be president, or something.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.445
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:37.520 --> 01:40.126
If he doesn't drink in the morning,
he will now.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.770
Oh, God, you know
what I should have brought up?

01:41.840 --> 01:45.686
That rumor about O'Brien's daughter
blowing all those hockey players in college.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.171
Well... That would have been a mistake.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.131
- Huge mistake. It was lacrosse players.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

01:51.200 --> 01:52.406
Ma'am, your dinner guests

01:52.480 --> 01:53.811
-are confirmed for tonight.
- Oh!

01:53.880 --> 01:57.566
- Your relaxing evening is locked in.
- Goodie. I cannot wait.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.642
I'm getting the old gang back together.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.008
Back in the '90s, us ladies
totally owned Annapolis. We really did.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.840
Gang? Did you all have tattoos?

02:05.920 --> 02:08.446
No, it's just a bunch of lawyers
from my old firm, you know?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.965
How did you get into this gang?

02:10.039 --> 02:11.530
- Did you have to kill a guy?
-(LAUGHTER)

02:12.040 --> 02:13.849
You could pardon yourself now.

02:13.920 --> 02:16.924
You know, actually, as women,
we really did get it done.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.684
Plus, we had tits and ass.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.491
So, we had
the whole thing going for us, really.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.882
There's been a shooting in Pittsburgh.
Four dead including the gunman.

02:26.400 --> 02:29.051
Well, that's fucking not good.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.246
We pray for the families.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.448
Yeah,
and that they don't demand more gun control.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.568
It says here the gunman was an ex-Marine.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.160
Two sides of the coin. It's very sad.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.891
Hey, Sue, get Mike to draft a statement.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.169
- He's got a "thoughts and prayers" template.
- Right away, ma'am.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.761
Oh...

02:44.880 --> 02:46.211
Should we keep watching me?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.411
- TOM: Yeah?
- Sure, sure.

02:53.800 --> 02:57.361
See, when I left the White House,
I never thought I'd be lobbying for concrete.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.841
- Great, isn't it?
- Mmm.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.685
Oh, by the way, I set us up with two brunches
and a lunch for tomorrow.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.969
Oh, God, I already have
two breakfast meetings tomorrow.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.367
If I keep going at this rate,
I'm gonna have gout of the mouth.

03:07.920 --> 03:11.083
Uh, ladies, you are going to be our sale bait.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.647
Um, by sale bait, you mean...

03:13.800 --> 03:15.928
Independent, well-educated
young women like you

03:16.000 --> 03:19.482
who also happen to be very hot
to lure congressmen into the room

03:19.560 --> 03:22.040
in a way that is deeply feminist.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.526
We then introduce our client,

03:23.680 --> 03:25.808
who makes a sale
in a way that's deeply capitalist.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.360
I'm not expected to do anything
with anyone, am I?

03:28.440 --> 03:31.683
This is lobbying.
This is a respectable profession.

03:31.760 --> 03:34.445
Um, do me a favor. Go see Linda over there.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.888
She has some slightly tighter blouses
that you can choose from.

03:37.960 --> 03:41.009
- So, you two ready to go hard for concrete?
- Yeah.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.764
Hey, why are there so many security

03:42.840 --> 03:45.491
and military people on the list
at this concrete event?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.925
Are we at war with clay?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.162
Amy, what does the military buy a lot of?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.890
Oh, I know this. It's candy.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.650
Cute. It's concrete, okay?

03:52.720 --> 03:54.290
So, we bring the military guys along,

03:54.360 --> 03:58.365
they talk Congress into stumping up money
for a Mexican border wall made of concrete.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.566
Circle of life.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.007
Serving several of our clients' agendas
all at once.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.809
- God, I love this.
- Yeah, I know. Me, too.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.291
It's so slutty, isn't it?

04:05.360 --> 04:08.091
This place is like a porn shoot with bunting.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.721
God, kill me now. (SIGHS)

04:11.800 --> 04:13.529
Good morning. Good morning.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.761
-(CHUCKLES)
- REPORTERS: Morning!

04:14.840 --> 04:16.125
Okay, let's get this party started.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.521
Uh, the Mommy Meyer bill. ls it doomed?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.442
First off, it's not the Mommy Meyer bill.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.683
It is the Families First... No, it's the Meyer bill.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.321
- And it's about as doomed as my donut habit.
-(LAUGHTER)

04:27.400 --> 04:29.926
- Shall we talk about Families First, please?
- SELINA: Yeah.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.088
TOM: I'm afraid it's getting
crucified on the Hill.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.446
Just like that Jesus guy.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.601
Well, it's my big bill.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.809
You think I'm gonna say it doesn't fit
and put it up on Craigslist, or something?

04:37.920 --> 04:39.809
O'Brien just said, "lf Families First is passed,

04:39.880 --> 04:42.451
"the whole concept of family
will come to an end."

04:42.520 --> 04:43.760
Well, that's the dream, certainly,

04:43.840 --> 04:45.604
but I'm not sure
we'll achieve it in this generation.

04:45.720 --> 04:48.803
I don't care if O'Brien hates it.
It's for the people and they love it.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.963
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Except no.
-l'm sorry?

04:52.040 --> 04:55.487
I hate to be the
I'm-in-touch-with-the-normal-guy guy,

04:55.560 --> 04:56.686
but I am that guy,

04:56.760 --> 05:00.048
and they want to pay for their families
and not other people's.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.690
That's not helpful to...

05:01.760 --> 05:03.364
- What? What's going on?
- MAN: Back away from the president.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.851
- Holy shit.
- Ma'am, there's an intruder.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.883
- Oh.
- We need you to remain here.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.804
What? I mean, okay. I mean, what?

05:09.880 --> 05:12.531
I had not anticipated this.
This I had not anticipated.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.001
Well, that sounds
like the world's worst Dr. Seuss book.

05:15.080 --> 05:16.650
Flexible hours benefit everyone.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.722
This is a common sense piece of...

05:18.800 --> 05:22.327
Intruder. Everyone stay calm.
Stay exactly where you are.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.085
Okay, lockdown.
Nobody move and nobody gets hurt.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.521
Shouldn't we be on an elevator
to a secret bunker by now?

05:27.600 --> 05:29.568
There is no elevator or bunker.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.569
Why isn't there an elevator
to a secret bunker?

05:31.640 --> 05:34.689
Jesus Christ, Bill,
you're shaking like a dog shitting a peach pit.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.684
SELINA: I actually think I should have a gun.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.566
I'm not making a joke.
I really would like to have a gun.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.927
Okay, what about us?
ls there a panic room, or something?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.331
Gary, every room you're in is a panic room.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.606
We need to find a safer room.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.170
MAN: I'm gonna kill
Tom James and that bitch!

05:46.280 --> 05:47.406
The intruder! Right there!

05:47.480 --> 05:49.721
Oh, my God, shit got real! Shit got real!
Shit got real!

05:49.800 --> 05:52.371
- Calm down. What are you doing?
-lt's a weapon!

05:52.440 --> 05:54.522
What are you going to do with a clock?
Tell him he's late?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.364
- That's the all-clear, ma'am.
- Really?

05:56.440 --> 05:57.771
- TOM: Well...
- Wow! Okay.

05:58.560 --> 06:00.050
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- BILL: Okay,

06:00.120 --> 06:02.043
if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go breathe.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.168
- Yeah, did you hear all that shouting?
- I did.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.890
What was he saying?
Did you hear what he was saying?

06:05.960 --> 06:08.008
Who cares what he said?
The guy's Nutso-Bismol.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.525
- What was he saying?
- What...

06:09.600 --> 06:14.083
He said, uh, "Let me up.
I want to kill Tom James and that bitch."

06:14.920 --> 06:18.322
He comes here to kill me
and he doesn't even know my name?

06:18.440 --> 06:20.886
- He may have been talking about Kent.
- Thank you.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.849
I've got to take a gigantic whiz.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.730
Man, this siege stuff
goes straight to my bladder.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.768
It's like if dogs could talk.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.443
Okay, Senator,
I am going to set up your town hall meeting.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.887
- L'll see you there.
- Oh, good. More adrenaline.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.564
God Almighty.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.890
- Wow.
- How are you doing?

06:38.280 --> 06:42.001
I cannot believe
that somebody came here to kill me.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.246
And you.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.561
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.883
Still, you know,
you've got good people around you.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.008
- Yeah.
- Holy hell!

06:52.080 --> 06:53.844
- I saw him! The guy.
- You did?

06:54.200 --> 06:57.204
I was face-to-face with him and I was like,
"Back off, man. Don't mess with this."

06:57.280 --> 07:00.284
- Really?
- I have got so much adrenaline in me.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.840
- SELINA: I know...
-lt's like I've got to do something.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.843
- Can you get me a coffee?
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.684
- An Irish coffee.
- Yeah!

07:07.520 --> 07:08.646
Do you want something?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.290
- I'm good.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.361
(GARY SHRIEKS)

07:11.440 --> 07:12.930
- He's been with me a long time.
- Has he?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.286
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I see.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.404
Hey, Kim. Hi, where are you?

07:17.480 --> 07:20.086
Can we make sure that the flags
are symmetrical to the backdrop?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.247
It looks a little bit off.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.522
That shirt really compliments your figure,
by the way.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.724
Just a nice little compliment for you.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.729
I'm loving this. This is great.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.002
- Yeah, we're killing this. Hey, lighting.
- MAN: What?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.209
Hi, how's it going?
Can we bring these down just a little bit?

07:33.320 --> 07:35.322
Okay, I think
that's a little bit too much drama.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.210
So, maybe we just bring those back up
just a little bit.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.804
That looks great. Yeah, mark that.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.201
MAN: That's exactly how it was, dumbass!

07:43.280 --> 07:45.681
Okay, well, we don't need
that kind of language, but thank you.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.730
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

07:48.800 --> 07:49.926
Hit me with the plosives.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.721
<i>Bring back my pig.</i>

07:53.960 --> 07:55.644
- I'm <i>happy with</i> that.
- Yeah, that sounds great.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.643
I don't want to pat myself on the back,

07:57.720 --> 08:00.041
but this is a great idea on my part.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.805
You know, getting out of the office,
going on the campaign trail.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.609
<i>Yeah, help you forget about being molested.</i>

08:04.680 --> 08:06.011
That's loud. I'm sorry.

08:06.080 --> 08:10.005
Yeah, well... Well, no. It's just that
everybody thinks we're awesome here.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.764
I mean, we're West Wing. We're like gods.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.808
Mr. Ryan, did you get my sashimi?

08:13.880 --> 08:15.882
No, sir, I will get it right now.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.442
It needs to be at room temperature,
otherwise it just tastes of cold.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.561
Yes.

08:20.640 --> 08:23.211
Sa-shi-mi.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.328
- Are you hearing this?
- Sushi.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.886
Listen to the "shu's" and the "mi's."

08:27.960 --> 08:29.405
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:30.440 --> 08:33.330
Wait a minute. What are we laughing at here?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.006
(MIKE LAUGHING)

08:35.080 --> 08:38.129
Someone sure put a lot of effort into that.
(LAUGHS)

08:38.200 --> 08:39.201
(BLOWING DUCK CALL)

08:39.280 --> 08:40.850
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:40.919 --> 08:42.251
I don't get it.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.207
Oh, duck, 'cause I ducked.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.282
Very clever. Very funny.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.531
I'm laughing, too.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.170
(LAUGHTER)

08:51.240 --> 08:52.401
Yeah.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.482
Mom, some days you get an award
from a country I've never even heard of,

08:56.560 --> 08:58.210
then other days people try to kill you.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.282
People probably try to kill me
most days, sweetie.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.089
You just have to shut it out.

09:02.160 --> 09:05.243
Hey, I've got the menu
for tonight's dinner with your friends.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.731
I do love tasting menus.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.361
It's so nice to be able to look at a list of food
and say, "I'll take all of it."

09:10.440 --> 09:15.048
Um, no. I just want to hang back
and have a loose night with the ladies, okay?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.485
So, let's just get pizza.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.642
How about a play on pizza?

09:18.720 --> 09:20.722
- We could kind of layer...
- No. Uh-uh. No.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.409
Or we could do an antipasto
and we could do a deconstructed pizza.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.926
Okay, you know
I almost got assassinated today, right?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.206
- Yeah, you did.
- So, I just...

09:28.280 --> 09:30.282
I just need you to do
what I'm telling you to do.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.801
Uh-huh.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.563
Guys, I want you to meet Aiden Grant.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.530
He's the gentleman that won
the previous Mexican border fence contract.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.410
Wow! You must be very happy and rich.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.891
- Yes, I am.
-(AMY LAUGHING)

09:41.960 --> 09:43.564
So, of course,
he would like to win the new one,

09:43.640 --> 09:45.768
which means
he needs to speak to Congressman Martin,

09:45.840 --> 09:48.650
but not his obvious erection.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.926
- DAN: Uh, yes.
- So...

09:50.000 --> 09:52.401
Oh, to be 20 years younger, eh?

09:52.480 --> 09:55.165
- I would be in diapers.
- Oh, snap! (LAUGHING)

09:55.360 --> 09:57.931
Okay, you see, the key is to jump in
before it becomes an actual assault.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.764
- I think we missed the window.
- Uh, Congressman.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.163
I can see you are as excited
about the advancements

10:02.240 --> 10:03.651
in concrete technology as we are.

10:03.720 --> 10:07.441
I would like to introduce you
to Mr. Aiden Grant.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.682
<i>There is a proven link
between the lack of education and poverty,</i>

<i>and between poverty and crime.</i>

10:16.240 --> 10:18.288
<i>Families First will break that link.</i>

10:30.400 --> 10:32.562
<i>that it's time for some stricter gun control?</i>

<i>Reaction is easy.</i>

10:35.840 --> 10:38.491
<i>Understanding is hard.</i>

(CROWD GASPS)

<i>someone whose mind was maimed
in the service of his country.</i>

10:49.440 --> 10:53.240

the shooter is a victim, too.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.960
Oh, my God!

10:56.040 --> 10:58.725
Calamity James.
And that's just off the top of my head.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.724
- Well, what do I do?
- Just get him off, you fucking mannequin.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.526
(SOFTLY) Jonah.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.568
Get him to stop. Get him to stop talking.

<i>I'm not saying
I don't condemn what happened. I do.</i>

11:10.080 --> 11:12.048
- Condemnation <i>on its</i> own...
- What the fuck are you doing?

11:12.120 --> 11:13.770
It looks like you're telling him
to straighten his tie.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.684
What I'm saying is, we need to understand...

11:17.840 --> 11:19.444
(CHUCKLES) Are you guys okay?

11:19.520 --> 11:21.284
Are you trying to hitch a ride? What is it?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.283
- No, you're good. You're good.
- No, what the fuck, dude?

11:23.360 --> 11:25.442
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

11:25.560 --> 11:27.642
If we're gonna take anything...

11:27.720 --> 11:29.688
Maybe we could play some exit music

11:29.760 --> 11:31.489
or maybe push the button
that drops the balloons.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.289
Shit, that's a great idea. Drop the balloons.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.249
- Do we have balloons?
- No. That was just an example.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.288
Why the fuck did you bring up balloons
if we don't have them?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.805
Well, just... I was brainstorming.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.366
MIKE: Ma'am, the press are primed.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.647
Good. So, I thought I would open with this.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.328
I thought I would say, "So, I'm in
the firing line for the second time today."

11:48.400 --> 11:49.731
Hilarious, ma'am.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.802
- Yeah, I know, it's not that funny.
- No, it's just my voice.

What? What's wrong?

Come with me.

just shot his mouth off into his foot.

and take the heat.

quantify what level of danger you were in?

that Tom James has said

13:03.040 --> 13:06.886
that the shooter in Pittsburgh
is as much a victim as those he murdered.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.042
Do you support that view?

13:09.120 --> 13:11.043
Uh, that is obvious, uh...

13:11.120 --> 13:12.281

-(MOUTHING) No.

I'll be fine.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.411
Yeah, a lot of good that's gonna do you.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.966
Tom James just sympathized
with that Pittsburgh shooter

13:56.040 --> 13:58.441
and in doing so
has blown his political brains out.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.240
Yeah, he just made an enemy
of every stupid person with a gun,

14:01.360 --> 14:02.521
and there are a lot of those.

If we don't do something about this,

14:03.840 --> 14:06.002

are gonna start to wonder

14:06.080 --> 14:08.242
why it is the hell they pay us so much money,

14:08.320 --> 14:11.403
which is bad because I need them to pay me
and not try and shoot me in my sleep.

-lt was out of my control.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.689
So, there are situations within your control?

18:05.520 --> 18:07.249
All right, so, what? Do we lose the gun guy?

18:07.320 --> 18:08.651
No, no. Keep the gun guy.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.200
Gun guys don't like it
when you take things away from them.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.081
But it has made me realize that
Tom James talked up mental health issues.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.691
- Let's get someone to jump on those.
- Exactly.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.569
Do we have any mental health
charities on the books?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.210
We do, but they don't pay very well.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.807
However, this is Alex Barry
from Gemmill Pharmaceuticals.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.041
- Ah...
- Amy Brookheimer.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.201
-(LAUGHING) Hi.
- Oh. How are you?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.766
So, uh, what is a big pharma guy like you

18:28.200 --> 18:30.248
doing at a concrete event like this?

18:30.880 --> 18:34.726
Well, construction brings builders.
Builders bring sex workers.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.808
And sex workers bring STDs.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.882
- A virtuous circle.
- Well...

18:39.200 --> 18:41.931

18:49.160 --> 18:50.685
Oh, you are hotter than ever.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.250
- Oh, puh-lease.
- I know!

18:52.360 --> 18:55.842

rhino horns or monkey glands?

- All of the above.

No, I didn't really have any surgery,
Deborah. I didn't.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.449
- I haven't had... No.
- Okay.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.161
This is sloe gin
and it's a gift from the British ambassador.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.651

for five years and four months, so...

19:18.080 --> 19:20.128
- Oh!
- Actually, yeah.

19:20.200 --> 19:24.000
Well, I have been sober for, uh, 27 hours,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.003

- Oh. Oh.

Just Coke, Sprite, something like that.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.771
- Okay, yeah.
- Soda.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.843
TOM: Benjamin, you wanted to see me?

19:39.240 --> 19:41.322
- Is this where I get whacked?
- BEN: Oh, no, sir.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.530
This is where we all blow you
because you were so freaking great.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.524

He's like your dad, except he's nice.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.362
What the fuck are these guys doing here?

19:56.440 --> 19:59.046
Every player needs to roll with a crew, Ben.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.849
That's the truth from the street.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.888
This is officially my worst day.

20:02.960 --> 20:06.248
Well, in that case,
welcome to Friday night drinks.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.765
Do you guys have drinks every Friday?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.444
Uh, only for the last five years.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.131
No one ever thought to tell you
for unaccountable reasons.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.487
Anyway, you're here now.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.883

- Ugh.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.888
-I'm more of a White Russian man myself.
- Here, take that.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.361
- Okay, I guess that's fine also.
- Have a seat.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.411
- Uh, not there.
- No. Wasn't going to.

20:28.480 --> 20:30.448
Okay, so, uh, what are we drinking to?

20:30.520 --> 20:31.567
To more shit.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.642
- More shit.
- All right. Good.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.082
When is the last time
when all of us were together?

20:38.160 --> 20:40.208
- Anna's wedding.
- That was 20 years ago.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.886
- Oh, no, it was five years ago.
- What?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.247
- I remarried.
- She got married again.

Yeah. Did he finally come out?

20:52.320 --> 20:53.560
He died.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.646
So sorry. (CHUCKLES)

20:59.720 --> 21:02.451
I'm not. I mean, he wasn't gay.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.568
- He was... He was just an asshole.
- Uh-huh.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.923
Can I swear in front of you now?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.684
No, you fucking can't.

- Wait until you see.

Oh, God, so tired of these big banquets.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.326
- You know, six courses. Enough.
- Yeah.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.324
What's for dessert,
a tub of ice cream and four spoons?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.286
That's forward thinking.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.966

22:16.760 --> 22:18.205
I believe we should legalize drugs.

Having seen what my son has been through,
I think it's the only way.

- I do a lot of pro bono work now.
- Oh, good for you.

Yeah, you know, family disputes,
school exclusions, that sort of thing.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.166
Look at us, we're working it from both ends.

How so?

22:46.920 --> 22:47.921
Um...

I'm about to pass this legislation.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.089
- Families First?
- Families First, yeah.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.571
I'm very proud of it.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.371
What do you guys think of it?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.960
Well, it's not everything
you want it to be, obviously,

23:03.040 --> 23:04.804
because they put all those amendments on it.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.406
- I think it's in pretty good shape. Yeah.
- Mmm.

23:07.480 --> 23:10.370
I mean, I think it's gonna
make a big difference in people's lives.

23:10.440 --> 23:14.161
Ah! Perhaps you haven't thought through
the tax margins properly.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.723
Wow. We have the finest
economic minds working on the bill.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.202
Thank God, because tax law
was never your strength.

- I really... I really read up about it a lot.
- Oh, my God.

Do you remember?
"What's 15%? What's 15%?"

- Okay.
